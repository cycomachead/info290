on
tap
at
dinosaur
bbq
in
syracuse
dark
malty
little
bit
of
bite
to
it
there
is
a
little
bitterness
in
the
after
taste
nicely
done
strong
ale
o
delicious
and
thick
rich
and
colorful
great
beer
thought
this
would
be
a
better
beer
than
it
is
still
not
horrible
and
one
that
is
sure
to
taste
good
with
some
morels
and
bacon
grilled
cheese
o
funny
name
but
not
a
great
beer
too
much
sweetness
a
little
bit
too
much
alcohol
presence
some
odd
offflavors
all
adds
up
to
an
underwhelming
beer
experience
o
this
is
a
damn
good
beer
great
tasting
yet
packs
a
good
punch
highly
recommend
this
beer
for
any
strong
ale
or
extreme
beer
fans
middle
ages
has
a
wide
range
of
beers
with
good
northeast
distribution
in
bars
and
22
oz
bottles
the
wench
has
been
one
of
their
staples
for
years
a
great
beer
for
those
craving
hops
in
the
winter
check
it
out
i
just
hope
that
the
wench
is
wailing
about
something
other
than
the
lack
of
hopsplosion
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
brew
was
the
solid
flavoring
and
the
great
feel
to
it
we
were
presented
with
a
beautiful
beer
in
coloring
and
in
foam
but
the
following
taste
after
the
invitation
was
robust
and
as
hoppy
as
advertised
the
bitterness
from
the
hops
really
dominated
the
finish
and
youre
left
with
quite
a
different
flavoring
than
you
start
with
which
keeps
the
drinker
guessing
the
nose
was
comparatively
weak
but
everything
else
was
exciting
and
decidedly
tasty
o
this
beer
is
hard
to
describe
as
it
its
tangy
and
sweet
with
some
dry
characteristics
due
to
the
fact
of
its
8
abv
its
a
big
beer
only
for
a
good
price
would
i
seek
this
out
again
but
pretty
good
for
a
one
off
onot
a
bastard
but
overall
very
solid
nice
job
middle
ages
amber
in
color
with
perfect
clarity
poured
with
a
thick
rocky
offwhite
foam
that
slowly
reduced
to
a
dense
cap
that
left
sheets
of
sticky
lacings
on
the
glass
intense
caramel
malt
and
citrus
hop
aromas
along
with
a
buttery
nut
aroma
thick
syrupy
feel
with
light
lazy
carbonation
floral
and
citrus
hop
flavors
up
front
that
slowly
fade
from
beginning
to
end
with
a
solid
sticky
sweet
caramel
malt
backbone
finishes
pretty
cleanly
with
light
floral
hop
bitterness
in
the
back
of
the
tongue
appearance
is
a
dusty
reddishbrown
a
dark
amber
with
a
coffeecoloured
head
and
impressive
lacing
aroma
of
sweet
caramelized
malts
and
bready
fruit
the
flavour
starts
with
a
pleasant
west
coast
style
hop
punch
but
is
then
surprisingly
sweet
before
its
bitter
closing
a
nicely
dry
finish
lingers
with
an
alcoholic
warmth
appropriate
for
8
abv
overall
the
bitterness
in
the
finish
is
a
bit
much
but
im
a
fan
of
this
beer
the
warm
alcohol
is
a
welcome
addition
to
the
other
flavors
3
5
odthis
is
a
hefty
beer
that
has
its
pleasantries
it
reminds
me
of
a
less
refined
arrogant
bastard
i
enjoyed
this
but
was
not
in
love
with
it
still
its
well
worth
a
try
i
can
think
of
a
good
grouping
of
beers
i
would
rather
spend
my
6
on
for
a
bomber
but
this
was
still
a
solid
big
ale
o
i
think
this
is
a
great
example
of
a
balanced
strong
ale
it
does
a
great
job
of
taking
the
abv
up
a
notch
and
increasing
the
malthop
profile
to
match
i
dont
think
this
one
will
knock
anyones
socks
off
but
it
will
certainly
be
a
contender
for
their
goto
big
beer
d
a
big
rich
and
firmly
hoppy
ale
very
approachable
for
its
robustness
of
flavor
yet
although
it
does
not
flaunt
its
abv
it
is
obviously
hefty
very
much
a
sipper
with
both
pleasant
and
aggressive
aspects
a
great
brew
for
relaxing
on
a
cold
day
superbly
rich
and
enjoyable
appearance
is
amber
with
a
nice
foam
with
good
color
smell
has
the
right
blend
of
hops
and
malt
this
beer
has
nice
mix
of
hops
and
malt
that
is
felt
on
the
tongue
mouthfeel
is
good
there
is
a
slight
lingering
but
nothing
that
take
away
from
the
taste
overall
this
is
a
fridge
worthy
beer
get
some
and
have
a
few
peanuts
and
enjoy
oh
have
this
with
some
old
bay
wings
you
will
not
regret
that
overall
this
was
pretty
enjoyable
really
made
me
think
of
an
american
hopped
belgian
double
triple
blend
perhaps
a
bit
too
much
heat
for
the
abv
but
regardless
this
was
a
flavorful
interesting
and
enjoyable
brew
that
im
glad
to
have
tried
thanks
again
for
picking
this
up
for
me
steg
the
off
flavors
and
weird
smell
really
ruined
this
one
for
me
the
malt
and
hops
dont
shine
through
and
each
sip
is
another
dimension
in
odd
yeasty
flavors
id
say
its
medium
bodied
with
the
carbonation
on
the
light
side
the
mouthfeel
isnt
all
that
good
but
its
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
so
i
give
it
a
thumbs
up
nice
different
sort
of
beer
this
beer
poured
out
with
an
explosive
amount
of
head
i
tried
pouring
slowly
into
two
glasses
and
got
no
where
with
it
so
i
gave
it
some
time
to
settle
and
eventually
i
got
to
look
at
the
nice
yellow
body
this
beer
has
the
smell
of
yeast
malts
and
hops
all
show
up
in
this
one
the
taste
was
quite
nice
it
had
a
really
nice
balance
from
start
to
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
drinkable
and
easy
to
put
down
overall
this
brew
wouldnt
have
gotten
my
attention
without
the
girl
on
the
label
but
im
happy
to
have
got
a
bottle
its
enjoyable
overall
surprisingly
good
for
the
cheesy
label
id
get
it
again
drink
a
huge
mix
of
beer
in
this
glass
hoppy
citrus
malty
sugary
bold
a
bit
unbalanced
but
it
works
i
am
glad
to
have
had
this
and
even
more
glad
to
have
a
double
wench
to
ogle
the
strenght
of
malt
alcohol
and
hops
but
in
superb
balance
imediately
remind
me
of
stones
arrogant
bastard
ale
except
with
a
less
pronounced
inyourface
resiny
hop
bitterness
still
a
delightful
beer
for
those
who
prefer
strength
and
balance
d
i
think
the
bottle
i
got
wasnt
the
freshest
but
i
cant
be
certain
i
wish
they
would
just
date
their
bottles
id
like
to
have
a
crack
at
a
bottle
i
know
for
a
fact
is
fresh
next
time
so
i
can
compare
thanks
again
for
the
beer
vince
pours
a
tawny
color
with
a
singlefinger
tan
head
and
a
good
bit
of
lacing
as
it
goes
down
thin
collar
throughout
the
nose
carries
a
good
amount
of
brown
sugar
plus
a
nice
bit
of
citrus
smelling
this
i
thought
this
was
an
esb
maybe
so
just
a
very
strong
one
probably
more
properly
classified
as
an
english
strong
ale
flavor
brings
a
slight
bit
of
diacetyl
and
some
malty
sweetness
moderate
fruitiness
the
hops
really
dont
come
through
until
the
finish
which
is
fairly
bitter
classic
esbtype
profile
really
well
done
notes
this
is
definitely
a
well
made
and
very
enjoyable
beer
d
a
good
but
not
great
beer
offering
a
nice
balance
between
malts
and
hops
while
allowing
the
alcohol
to
show
through
as
well
medium
body
average
carbonation
drinks
well
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
id
have
it
again
okind
of
boring
but
not
bad
d
it
is
a
pretty
good
beer
overall
and
it
hides
the
8
well
i
could
drink
multiple
glasses
of
this
but
i
dont
know
how
often
i
would
seek
this
out
the
aroma
is
the
best
part
of
this
beer
imho
drinkability
easy
drinking
strong
ale
with
a
powerful
hop
bit
alcohol
is
well
integrated
one
bomber
is
plenty
dn
very
well
done
too
bad
this
stuff
is
not
readily
available
to
me
might
make
a
trade
in
the
future
for
a
couple
of
bottles
i
would
like
to
see
how
this
ages
this
is
a
great
favorite
of
mine
for
a
strong
ale
it
is
easily
on
the
palate
with
abundance
of
flavor
and
complexity
i
really
need
to
get
out
to
the
brewery
and
get
a
fresh
case
have
to
do
some
draft
and
cask
reviews
for
this
as
well
i
enjoy
the
bottle
but
have
had
it
on
draft
several
times
and
found
the
things
slightly
lacking
in
the
bottle
are
right
on
in
the
draft
version
conclusion
i
feel
it
is
becoming
more
and
more
rare
to
be
totally
surprised
by
a
new
beer
in
this
case
however
i
am
happy
to
say
that
i
am
really
surprised
how
good
this
beer
is
it
nailed
every
category
and
especially
the
mouthfeel
the
best
i
have
felt
in
an
american
strong
ale
if
i
am
ever
around
new
york
i
will
be
seeking
this
one
out
nothing
particularly
bad
about
this
but
overall
pretty
average
i
tasted
middle
ages
at
the
mini
gabf
in
baltimore
in
the
late
90s
i
was
in
syracuse
last
summer
i
bought
this
at
wegmans
it
is
a
lovely
beer
dseems
to
be
a
reoccuring
theme
here
but
it
is
really
nice
and
drinkable
pours
a
crisp
clear
orangeish
red
a
good
amount
offwhite
head
with
great
lacing
smells
hoppy
and
malty
a
nice
balance
on
the
nose
tastes
a
bit
too
sweet
on
the
tongue
some
light
bitterness
on
the
pallette
smooth
and
full
bodied
a
fairly
decent
strong
ale
but
overall
not
outstanding
pales
in
comparison
to
th
double
wench
if
anyone
has
a
fresh
bottle
of
this
and
would
like
to
send
it
to
me
perhaps
my
opinion
would
change
d
easy
drinking
if
a
bit
of
a
sipper
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
heavier
side
with
carbonation
being
a
bit
below
average
drinkability
is
pretty
good
it
had
some
nice
flavors
to
it
overall
everything
came
together
and
worked
pretty
well
it
showed
off
some
nice
hoppy
and
malty
flavors
throughout
drinking
it
very
enjoyable
beer
overall
this
is
an
interesting
beer
with
less
hops
it
could
be
an
english
barleywine
with
more
malt
and
hops
to
compensate
it
could
be
an
american
barleywine
its
too
dark
to
be
an
imperial
amber
a
la
nugget
nectar
i
guess
strong
ale
is
a
fitting
classification
but
it
drinks
a
point
or
two
less
abv
than
its
listed
8
a
pretty
solid
beer
that
is
going
nicely
with
a
bowl
of
dry
roasted
peanuts
drobust
flavors
and
smoothness
of
this
beer
along
with
good
combination
of
malt
and
hops
make
this
a
great
beer
to
enjoy
and
is
one
of
the
best
ive
had
i
am
glad
i
got
to
try
this
but
dont
think
i
would
choose
it
a
second
time
if
i
saw
it
on
the
shelf
strong
earthy
and
rough
hoppy
flavors
abound
if
there
were
an
english
strong
ale
this
would
fit
well
has
some
bubblegum
yeastiness
that
balances
some
of
the
burnt
malty
flavors
hops
are
pretty
unique
grassy
and
earthy
floral
even
the
wench
is
a
bit
rough
around
the
edges
but
makes
for
a
fun
one
night
stand
very
flavorful
mouthfeel
is
not
necessarily
smooth
and
creamy
but
it
is
certainly
full
reminds
me
of
a
cross
between
hairy
eyeball
and
arrogant
bastard
with
more
of
an
english
hop
flavor
pretty
tasty
beverage
overall
this
was
a
solid
beer
that
i
am
very
glad
i
traveled
into
lower
manhattan
to
find
it
along
with
a
few
other
gems
obviously
a
really
solid
example
of
an
english
style
strong
ale
my
favorite
style
which
i
feel
isnt
crafted
enough
in
this
country
d
a
very
hopcentric
strong
ale
with
great
attention
paid
to
the
malty
details
as
well
the
8
abv
is
not
that
noticeable
through
the
strong
fruity
malt
flavors
and
dulls
even
further
as
the
hops
subside
a
bit
and
the
brew
warms
complex
and
enjoyable
good
for
a
disguised
hop
fix
as
well
definitely
a
beer
to
savor
yet
i
dont
think
it
would
be
completely
out
of
the
question
to
put
this
in
a
pint
glass
and
pound
a
couple
the
malt
backbone
and
complexity
makes
it
drinkable
enough
d
for
a
beer
this
rich
and
bold
tasting
it
does
so
without
sacrificing
drinkability
very
pleasant
beer
overall
drink
a
solid
wellbalanced
ipa
that
is
definitely
worth
trying
id
really
like
to
try
this
one
on
draft
cheers
md
full
bodied
and
a
lasting
bitterness
very
easy
drinking
for
something
this
hoppy
appearance
is
a
clearamber
with
2
fingers
of
offwhite
tan
head
smell
is
alcohol
dark
fruits
plum
and
caramelized
wort
taste
is
almost
caramel
and
prunes
actually
delicious
mouthfeel
is
good
amount
of
carb
sticky
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
is
good
when
you
share
it
it
might
be
too
much
if
i
did
one
on
my
own
good
beer
md
full
bodied
carbonation
is
a
touch
high
and
prickly
drinkability
is
good
for
a
beer
this
bold
especially
since
8
abv
strikes
me
as
low
just
how
big
this
beer
feels
superb
the
taste
is
absolutely
brilliant
along
with
the
dryness
that
you
get
from
the
intense
hoppyness
the
alcohol
is
alittle
noticible
but
it
blends
well
with
all
that
is
going
on
with
this
beer
i
could
sip
this
beer
all
day
its
a
wonderful
wonderful
thing
big
body
with
a
great
smooth
feel
slick
with
alcohol
and
malty
sweetness
no
problem
at
all
sipping
this
bomber
til
its
gone
high
drinkability
for
8
poured
a
coppercaramel
color
with
reddish
hints
when
held
up
to
light
into
a
pint
glass
with
less
than
a
finger
of
offwhite
good
head
retention
and
good
lacing
smelled
very
malty
with
hints
of
fig
and
raisin
as
well
as
some
hints
of
grapefruit
and
modest
alcohol
presence
big
malty
dark
fruit
blend
dissolving
to
more
citrus
notes
at
the
finish
which
also
revealed
some
bitter
peel
as
well
as
some
alcohol
thick
feel
though
mitigated
somewhat
by
the
modest
carbonation
content
nice
beer
hoppier
than
expected
though
a
little
too
thick
for
me
to
session
d
wailing
wench
is
a
splendid
brew
to
enjoy
while
there
is
some
strength
in
the
brew
i
feel
as
though
it
is
still
so
tasty
it
has
some
alcohol
but
you
can
still
slam
dunk
this
middle
ages
you
need
to
let
the
rest
of
the
world
know
what
you
do
d
syracuse
you
have
a
winner
d
very
easy
to
drink
especially
for
an
8
ale
the
body
is
pleasantly
full
but
again
not
heavy
drinkability
is
excellent
this
bottle
reminds
me
how
much
i
liked
this
brew
when
i
lived
in
upstate
ny
worth
seeking
out
very
good
beer
additional
points
for
busting
out
of
the
style
box
nothing
extreme
just
a
good
wellcrafted
beer
pours
a
clear
chestnut
color
with
a
large
offwhite
head
that
had
excellant
retention
the
head
eventually
settles
to
a
thick
cap
rings
of
lace
are
left
at
every
stage
of
the
glass
during
consumption
wonderful
balanced
aroma
between
hops
and
malt
rich
caramel
notes
first
hit
the
nose
then
citrus
and
pine
hops
kicks
in
i
would
not
mind
my
dipas
smelling
and
tasting
like
this
but
i
know
i
am
in
the
minority
nicely
balanced
flavor
as
well
caramel
malt
and
buttery
yeast
gives
way
to
bitter
citrus
and
pine
hops
a
touch
of
fusel
alcohol
makes
its
presence
known
at
the
finish
finishes
clean
for
such
a
robust
beer
medium
body
enough
carbonation
to
keep
things
lively
nice
texture
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
seemed
perfectly
balanced
to
this
drinker
d
this
is
a
very
drinkable
ale
that
i
could
learn
to
trade
for
in
massive
amounts
i
have
been
wanting
to
try
this
for
a
little
bit
and
now
i
understand
why
people
scream
good
reviews
for
it
pours
deep
brown
with
a
huge
torrent
of
carbonation
leading
to
a
vast
long
lasting
head
aroma
is
darkly
caramel
flavor
is
deep
caramelly
almost
burned
with
dark
fruit
and
a
strong

and
a
sharp
burning
hop
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
syrupy
this
beer
feels
heavy
and
primitive
drinkability
good
but
not
something
i
would
drink
all
night
slick
and
full
of
hop
oil
slides
down
the
gullet
with
incredible
ease
perfect
amount
of
carbonation
this
brew
cannot
get
much
better
slight
alcohol
warmth
though
the
alcohol
flavor
is
hidden
superbly
drinkability
is
slightly
above
average
as
this
little
number
may
destroy
your
palate
if
you
are
not
converted
to
the
gloriousness
of
the
hop
somewhatcloudy
brown
brew
turns
ruby
red
against
a
light
inch
and
a
half
of
rocky
tan
foam
settles
to
a
stable
half
inch
that
leaves
great
lacing
behind
nose
is
a
thick
biscuit
huge
caramel
vanilla
like
creme
brulee
mild
earthy
and
citrus
notes
also
apparent
taste
is
like
creme
brulee
plus
hops
good
hoppy
bitterness
that
isnt
apparent
in
the
smell
mouthfeel
is
full
and
creamy
with
a
lingering
hop
finish
very
enjoyable
lace
endures
to
the
end
notes
for
a
big
beer
it
is
relatively
approachable
the
hop
flavor
is
a
little
different
but
its
not
too
intense
or
anything
pours
a
dark
amber
with
a
nice
beige
head
good
lace
and
retention
nose
hase
has
sweet
bready
malts
toffee
caramel
and
light
floral
hops
not
exactly
teh
hop
explosion
as
stated
on
the
label
the
taste
was
well
balanced
with
subtle
hebal
hops
and
dark
candy
malts
nice
bitter
finish
but
again
definately
not
a
hop
explosion
full
lasting
body
is
well
carbonated
nice
strong
ale
but
definately
not
screaming
with
hops
overall
this
was
a
solid
beer
that
i
am
very
glad
i
got
to
have
ontap
in
syracuse
for
my
first
taste
of
it
im
sure
wailing
wench
and
i
will
cross
paths
again
i
finished
the
bomber
but
was
forcing
the
last
few
pours
will
try
again
just
to
make
sure
i
didnt
have
a
bad
bottle
overall
i
am
not
sure
what
to
make
of
this
one
if
it
did
not
label
itself
o
be
soo
hoppy
i
might
have
liked
it
a
little
more
but
it
set
a
bar
i
dont
feel
it
reached
cheers
beertracker
cant
really
drink
more
than
1
maybe
2
of
these
because
it
feels
somewhat
thicker
than
you
would
expect
but
great
never
the
less
thanks
to
aerozeppl
for
this
bomber
pours
a
deep
amber
color
with
a
nice
thick
fluffy
head
leaving
some
chunky
lacing
along
the
glass
getting
lots
of
bready
biscuity
malts
in
the
nose
along
with
a
heavy
dose
of
butterscotch
typical
of
alot
of
their
beers
i
think
some
floral
hops
lurking
in
the
background
not
exactly
screaming
with
hops
as
the
label
would
suggest
taste
follows
the
nose
with
bready
malt
with
a
hint
of
caramel
sweetness
followed
by
a
nice
floral
hop
bitterness
the
diactyl
is
quite
noticable
as
well
with
just
a
touch
of
alcohol
good
carbonation
and
a
nice
mouthfeel
goes
down
smooth
and
easy
good
beer
but
i
cant
get
over
the
diactly
butteriness
a
nicedrinking
strong
ale
by
middle
ages
the
aroma
is
hoppy
and
sweet
with
dark
fruits
the
flavor
is
a
bit
sweet
with
a
brown
sugar
and
carmel
flavot
but
the
hops
overpower
it
carbonation
is
high
and
the
finish
is
dry
the
hop
bitterness
lingers
in
the
mouth
a
bit
too
long
poured
into
a
sam
adams
perfect
pint
glass
it
pours
a
deep
brown
color
but
comes
out
a
dark
amberred
when
held
up
to
the
light
has
a
thick
cream
colored
head
that
goes
away
pretty
quickly
and
not
nearly
as
much
lacing
as
i
expected
the
smell
was
a
little
different
than
i
expected
but
excellent
it
didnt
smell
as
hoppy
as
i
expected
but
it
was
clearly
present
then
it
had
a
nice
sweet
smell
to
it
almost
like
a
brown
sugar
the
taste
didnt
quite
live
up
to
the
smell
maybe
it
was
the
hype
of
the
smell
i
just
created
there
was
a
citrus
hop
to
it
with
some
caramelized
malt
both
the
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
was
good
no
alcohol
bite
at
all
i
really
like
american
strong
ales
this
wasnt
my
favorite
by
any
stretch
but
it
was
good
and
id
try
it
again
pretty
original
the
appearance
is
light
brown
with
an
average
head
it
reminds
me
of
a
root
beer
the
aroma
is
quite
nice
with
loads
of
pine
and
grass
hops
there
is
also
caramel
malt
the
taste
is
like
the
aroma
but
the
finish
is
astringent
the
palate
is
smooth
overall
a
well
crafted
beer
drinkability
solid
for
the
summer
or
winter
months
but
more
like
a
dipa
which
strong
ales
sometime
represent
i
could
easily
make
this
a
session
brew
as
its
flavorful
as
hell
without
being
over
the
top
drinkability
one
pint
is
plenty
since
it
has
such
a
wallop
of
complexities
m
nice
smooth
full
mouth
feel
conclusion
not
something
id
drink
all
the
time
but
nice
to
try
now
and
again
this
ones
bold
brash
and
makes
no
excuses
for
what
it
is
which
is
imo
a
bit
over
the
top
the
sweetness
is
just
a
little
bit
cloying
and
a
bit
more
depth
would
be
appreciated
bottle
pours
a
clear
brown
with
a
thick
tan
head
aroma
of
sweet
malt
and
some
bitter
hops
plus
a
really
an
odd
smell
of
curdled
milk
slight
diacetyl
flavor
is
more
similar
to
an
asa
with
lots
of
malt
and
a
bitter
finish
decent
nothing
great
but
certainly
drinkable
this
is
a
good
strong
ale
no
problem
drinking
the
bomber
it
is
my
first
beer
from
middle
ages
brewing
i
think
it
would
improve
if
there
was
more
hop
flavor
and
aroma
especially
considering
that
it
claims
to
be
an
ale
screaming
with
hops
that
being
said
it
is
still
very
good
overall
i
would
definitely
drink
this
as
much
as
i
can
find
it
buy
it
drinkability
is
definatly
there
but
with
the
heat
it
has
lowered
my
score
just
a
bit
i
can
handle
this
one
bottle
but
more
then
one
would
probably
drunken
me
up
super
glad
i
got
to
try
this
im
pretty
interested
would
2
years
in
the
cellar
would
do
for
the
taste
bringing
down
some
of
the
hop
bite
and
balancing
the
taste
as
well
as
removing
the
warmth
overall
an
average
strong
ale
hop
presence
is
lacking
but
very
drinkable
not
my
favorite
in
style
but
would
i
would
grab
it
on
tap
if
i
see
it
again
the
taste
is
complex
and
thorough
not
a
beer
to
be
drank
on
an
empty
stomach
mouthfeel
is
intriguing
with
quite
a
bit
of
flavor
hitting
the
palate
all
in
all
a
great
beer
and
it
is
from
upstate
ny
so
why
hot
md
fuller
bodied
with
just
enoughcarbonation
not
a
session
beer
but
very
enjoyable
and
i
certainly
would
try
this
beer
again
all
in
all
im
not
sure
im
qualified
to
review
some
of
the
ma
brews
i
find
my
pallete
cant
sense
out
the
positives
that
the
beer
typically
gets
from
most
reviewers
im
sure
this
has
to
do
with
not
having
the
ability
to
appreciate
the
style
sooo
sorry
for
the
low
rating
d
first
the
label
is
easy
to
look
at
the
beer
itself
is
pretty
and
has
plenty
of
flavor
to
be
enjoyed
as
the
beer
warms
up
it
changes
into
a
different
drink
but
equally
as
good
this
is
not
the
kind
of
beer
i
would
sit
down
and
pound
but
i
could
see
myself
enjoying
a
couple
would
go
nice
with
cheese
pours
a
brownish
copper
color
into
my
chimay
goblet
several
pillars
of
bubbles
rise
in
the
glass
a
thin
layer
of
head
ponds
the
surface
nose
is
mildly
fruity
very
clear
appearance
very
evident
hops
in
this
8
percent
old
ale
as
it
warms
is
it
parsley
maybe
in
the
nose
definitely
herbal
the
bitterness
in
this
brew
drowns
away
any
maltiness
or
aggressive
nose
not
a
very
balanced
brew
good
but
not
special
d
this
is
definitely
on
the
hoppy
side
for
a
strong
ale
the
hops
really
opened
up
as
the
liquid
warmed
up
however
this
is
wonderfully
balanced
ale
with
plenty
of
malty
goodness
and
hop
flavor
taste
pine
and
citrus
its
pretty
bitter
as
it
warms
chocolate
and
biscuit
notes
show
up
slick
mouthfeel
and
great
carbonation
i
picked
up
a
22oz
bottle
of
this
having
never
heard
of
it
the
chick
on
the
label
is
kind
of
hot
btw
i
poured
this
into
my
chimay
goblet
pours
a
nice
dark
brown
color
it
was
an
easy
pour
so
there
wasnt
too
much
of
a
head
there
was
plenty
of
foam
though
that
stayed
atop
the
beer
nice
lacing
left
behind
after
the
first
sip
sweet
malty
caramel
aroma
with
a
noticable
alcohol
presence
smells
a
bit
smokey
and
get
a
sense
of
some
vanilla
in
there
the
first
sip
was
kind
of
harsh
on
a
clean
palate
a
real
malty
sweetness
to
it
with
plenty
of
hops
again
the
alcohol
is
there
a
touch
of
bitterness
but
not
too
much
becomes
increasingly
easy
to
drink
with
each
sip
and
quite
enjoyable
medium
to
full
bodied
and
quite
smooth
very
drinkable
i
wish
i
had
another
bottle
to
bust
into
tonight
this
is
a
top
flight
american
strong
and
has
plenty
of
character
with
great
balance
and
only
a
touch
of
alcohol
great
stuff
from
one
of
new
yorks
top
brewers
mouthfeel
is
slick
and
slightly
oily
interesting
indeed
a
much
better
beer
than
the
first
sip
indicated
a
solid
brew
drinkability
not
only
was
the
label
nice
but
the
beer
behind
it
as
well
if
you
love
the
taste
of
grapefruit
then
look
no
further
this
is
your
beer
sometimes
i
thought
the
grapefruit
was
a
little
too
much
and
wanted
something
new
for
a
change
luckily
there
were
more
flavors
behind
the
grapefruit
was
it
well
balanced
not
really
there
was
no
way
in
hell
these
toasted
malts
could
balance
out
all
of
these
grapefruit
flavors
would
i
drink
this
beer
again
even
if
they
changed
the
label
i
would
still
drink
this
beer
its
great
strong
ale

d
always
a
great
drinker
their
cask
versions
of
their
beers
always
seem
to
be
hoppier
than
the
bottled
or
draft
versions
very
enjoyable
this
is
a
very
well
balanced
beer
hops
and
malt
are
equally
bold
and
complex
making
for
a
highly
drinable
ale
d
this
beer
hides
the
strong
in
its
style
very
well
add
that
to
the
delicious
smell
and
taste
and
factor
in
the
great
mouthfeel
and
youve
got
yourself
one
wickedly
drinkable
beer
poured
a
translucent
dark
orange
color
with
a
thick
frothy
head
leaving
behind
plenty
of
lacing
aromas
of
hops
oil
fresh
produce
and
oranges
seemed
to
come
out
nicely
the
taste
followed
suit
with
a
slightly
timid
hop
profile
that
was
chased
by
a
brown
sugar
flavor
the
finish
was
dry
and
crisp
as
might
be
expected
for
the
style
the
texture
was
a
bit
oily
and
poppy
but
enjoyable
i
shared
this
bomber
with
another
person
so
i
did
not
quite
have
a
full
pint
of
it
but
what
i
did
have
was
plenty
for
me
i
would
not
actively
seek
more
of
the
same
in
a
single
session
pours
a
pretty
sexylooking
copper
color
lots
of
dark
ruby
highlights
massive
frothy
tan
head
hangs
around
for
a
while
and
leaves
lots
and
lots
of
sticky
lacing
in
the
glass
soft
perfumey
hops
in
the
nose
and
a
huge
rich
caramel
malt
aroma
lots
of
caramel
flavor
some
slight
citrus
and
a
good
dose
of
alcohol
coming
through
as
well
mediumbodied
i
think
id
like
this
one
a
little
more
chewy
pretty
tasty
and
definitely
worth
seeking
out
quite
drinkable
a
good
beer
but
not
great
very
nice
sipper
with
some
strong
food
this
can
stand
up
to
a
lot
on
the
plate
and
not
be
overwhelmed
by
much
of
anything
amber
body
with
a
sticky
offwhite
head
that
laces
well
earthy
hop
aroma
with
some
citrus
and
sweet
smoky
malts
a
lot
more
hops
in
the
flavour
than
i
was
expecting
more
or
less
wrestling
the
caramel
bready
malts
to
the
ground
and
smothering
them
in
citrus
peel
and
earth
full
bodied
and
chewy
a
very
contemplative
beer
and
dangerously
drinkable
at
8
mouthfeel
drinkability
both
score
low
due
to
level
of
hop
bitterness
again
this
is
not
a
balanced
beer
huge
on
hops
this
one
promises
hops
right
on
the
bottle
and
delivers
a
truck
load
and
for
those
of
you
who
like
carmel
malt
you
wont
be
disapointed
the
8
alcohoal
is
hiden
well
this
one
makes
me
happy
that
i
have
taste
buds
if
you
can
get
one
of
these
take
it
hv
drinkability
is
pretty
good
for
a
strong
ale
its
pretty
tasty
and
smooth
drinking
not
to
heavy
and
pretty
clean
the
lower
price
certainly
helps
d
drinkability
is
good
for
8
it
goes
down
easy
limit
is
pretty
much
one
bomber
though
too
much
carbonation
holds
this
beer
back
but
not
by
much
i
would
have
this
one
again
glad
i
got
the
chance
to
try
it
d
wouldnt
session
this
one
and
over
time
i
think
it
would
get
a
bit
much
lots
of
flavour
and
complexity
though
definitely
worth
trying
offwhite
head
with
fair
lace
deep
red
color
almost
brown
the
smell
is
very
malty
fruity
hints
of
sugar
malt
dark
fruits
alcohol
and
somewhat
earthy
mediumbodied
with
a
clean
finish
highly
drinkable
for
a
strong
ale
and
a
good
strong
ale
but
nothing
epic
recommended
though
i
was
sorely
disappointed
by
this
beer
i
was
hoping
for
much
better
the
beer
pours
a
darkish
ruby
color
with
lots
of
frothy
head
and
lacing
the
smell
is
rather
pungent
there
are
molasses
caramel
aromas
upfront
with
some
dryish
hop
heavy
fruit
aromas
in
the
backbone
the
taste
is
another
matter
there
is
very
astringent
and
bitter
hoppiness
there
is
also
a
cloying
almondvanilla
extract
like
unpleasant
taste
to
the
beer
some
reviewers
commented
upon
the
ringwood
yeast
used
perhaps
this
gives
the
beer
the
phenolic
weirdness
that
i
couldnt
get
beyond
there
is
plenty
of
crystallized
caramel
maltiness
to
this
beer
throughout
the
hops
were
just
too
biting
and
overall
i
thought
the
beer
to
be
so
out
of
balance
that
i
could
not
enjoy
this
on
any
level
the
aftertaste
was
a
bit
harsh
as
well
this
is
a
one
and
done
for
me
d
the
asa
is
not
really
my
favorite
but
this
beer
is
definitely
well
craftedi
will
recommend
it
to
any
hop
head
lover
it
is
a
little
harsh
for
me
but
you
can
buy
it
i
think
you
will
not
be
disappointed
i
finished
this
bomber
in
record
time
and
it
left
me
wanting
more
thanks
again
to
joe
for
this
great
experience
aww
the
wench
put
a
nice
glow
in
my
cheeks
pours
a
clear
darker
amber
color
thats
iced
tealike
she
sports
way
better
than
a
full
finger
foamy
light
yellowhued
tan
head
that
resists
fading
visibly
effervescent
the
head
is
kept
alive
from
beneath
spotty
patterns
of
belgian
lacing
in
its
wake
a
bit
more
head
and
lace
as
things
warm
up
some
3d
this
girl
screams
citrus
grapefruit
hop
when
you
pop
her
cap
the
smell
is
unbalanced
towards
the
hops
but
under
that
i
get
a
toasted
lagerlike
malty
note
nicely
carbonated
the
mouth
feel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
lighter
texture
that
lends
a
bit
to
her
drinkability
full
flavored
the
hop
and
toasted
malt
taste
combination
is
a
winner
the
whole
thing
lingers
really
nicely
but
the
8
abv
is
integrated
well
enough
that
multiples
are
likely
get
yours
on
awesome
effort
from
the
good
folks
at
middle
ages
cheers
looking
at
the
other
reviews
maybe
im
being
a
bit
too
harsh
but
if
a
beer
claims
to
be
screaming
with
hops
but
a
good
beer
overall

5this
is
a
beer
that
really
doesnt
fit
a
standard
style
i
must
say
i
really
like
this
beer
beertruth
included
it
as
a
surprise
in
a
trade
and
im
glad
he
did
it
isnt
very
balanced
and
i
may
go
as
far
as
calling
it
a
hopbomb
but
thats
perfectly
fine
in
my
book
i
would
also
suggest
letting
this
one
warm
up
for
half
an
hour
or
so
before
pouring
it
into
the
glass
the
flavors
of
an
ale
of
this
strength
come
out
much
better
at
warmer
temps
this
is
a
topnotch
brew
and
i
wish
i
could
buy
it
around
here
scott
stunning
chestnut
color
with
a
head
that
goes
on
forever
the
whole
way
down
the
glass
i
need
a
spoon
to
dig
thru
the
fluffy
tan
goodness
glad
i
have
a
mustache
very
deep
floral
and
malty
aromas
not
overly
pronounced
but
very
full
and
thick
solid
malt
flavor
with
an
extreme
blast
of
hop
bitterness
and
flavor
nice
resiny
and
earthy
notes
great
caramel
notes
terriffic
body
the
resiny
and
slickness
of
the
hops
really
comes
thru
on
the
palate
very
very
drinkable
beer
impressive
di
always
have
trouble
getting
through
a
bomber
wihtout
help
but
was
good
for
a
pint
on
tap
at
the
blue
tusk
one
was
enough
for
me
to
know
its
not
my
cup
of
tea
glad
to
have
tried
it
though
again
this
seemed
so
much
better
in
the
tasting
room
likely
due
to
its
atthesource
freshness
but
letting
it
warm
a
little
and
maybe
letting
it
age
longer
should
do
a
lot
for
it
as
it
is
it
is
very
enjoyable
and
i
look
forward
to
trying
it
with
some
age
on
it
this
is
a
good
beer
but
the
booze
takes
away
from
it
i
think
thats
just
common
with
the
style
i
wonder
how
this
will
taste

a
few
months

more
of

to

but
what
do
i
know
very

i
could
drink
this
all
night
but
the
8
abv
might
have
me
trying
to
score
with
the
chick
on
the
label
drinkability
this
is
no
way
a
session
beer
but
this
beer
beer
you
can
easily
drink
but
the
well
hidden
alcohol
can
catch
up
to
you
find
this
one
and
give
it
a
shot
overall
an
excellent
strong
ale
excellent
complex
hop
which
is
gently
presented
very
quaffable
thanks
to
beerbeing
for
this
and
many
other
great
brews
a
nice
beer
but
it
didnt
blow
me
away
still
a
quality
stong
ale
that
is
pretty
enjoyable
very
deep
copperlight
mahogany
body
topped
by
a
thick
creamy
tan
head
the
head
grudgingly
fades
but
it
clings
to
the
glass
like
an
obsessive
lover
aroma
has
nice
sweet
notes
but
its
dominated
by
hop
perfume
nice
pine
and
floral
notes
abound
as
for
the
flavor
bitterness
runs
rampant
pine
rosin
grapefruit
rind
and
herbal
bitterness
obscures
most
of
the
malt
and
alcohol
sweetness
a
bit
of
heat
can
be
felt
but
thats
about
it
nice
if
you
like
hop
juice
but
really
onedimensional
mouthfeel
is
a

thick

drinkability
is
great
for
hopheads
not
really
a
session
beer
or
one
that
id
even
come
close
to
calling
quaffable
or
if
i
were
a
short
stumble
home
this
is
for
you
what
can
i
say
but
the

makes
for
a

the

also

and
they
arent

a

clear

with
a
resiny
pine
finish
strong
flavorful
complex
and
well
crafted
ale
well
worth
seeking
out
the
aroma
on
this
beer
is
indeed
screaming
with
hops
as
loud
as
it
can
it
reeks
of
fresh
juicy
hops
and
it
has
a
lot
more
to
offer
too
nice
caramel
and
plum
in
the
nose
along
with
the
dripping
pine
sap
and
citrus
body
is
best
described
as
medium
bordering
on
the
low
end
of
strong
ale
heavy
perfect
carbonation
taste
is
a
whirlwind
of
hop
flavors
like
a
juicy
navel
orange
soaked
in
spruce
sap
then
something
remarkable
happens
as
the
flavor
makes
a
smooth
but
very
definite
transition
to
a
sweet
fruit
and
nut
bread
malty
middle
finish
wrapped
up
clean
and
dry
as
can
be
just
bitter
enough
to
make
you
grab
for
the
glass
again
as
quick
as
your
reflexes
allow
superbly
crafted
beer
this
one
eminently
drinkable
i
can
only
imagine
the
wonder
it
would
be
on
tap
this
is
a
very
good
doubleimperial
ipa
from
my
fine
friends
at
ma
this
brew
is
dark

with
a
nice
head
of
khaki
foam
the
aromas
are
of
heavy
caramel
malts
ringwood
yeast
notes
hops
fresh
baked
breads
and
more
the
taste
is
very
malty
and
hoppy
in
a
nice
unison
the
hops
hit
hard
up
front
but
the
malt
backbone
is
very
very
strong
as
well
with
a
very
pronounced
biscuit
flavor
in
the
mix
the
finish
is
leafy
and
raw
ie
awesome
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
thick
but
not
ott
and
the
drinkability
is
very
good
an
interesting
and
quite
awesome
double
ipa
with
that
distinctive
ringwood
fruitiness
blending
perfectly
with
those
distinctive
pacnw
hops
anyway
moving
on
the
beer
is
of
a
high
quality
indeed
i
was
very
impressed
it
was
a
dark
amber
colour
almost
like
very
weak
watereddown
coffee
actually
darker
than
im
used
to
for
an
ipa
it
had
a
good
sized
fluffy
slightly
offwhite
head
that
didnt
last
too
too
long
it
smelled
like
a
big
hop
festival
almost
stinging
my
nose
also
it
smelled
a
bit
bready
maybe
actually
yes
tasted
oh
so
good
the
hops
were
very
much
there
but
not
in
your
face
it
was
as
though
i
was
drinking
a
buttery
dinner
roll
along
with
a
side
of
fresh
green
hops
no
real
trace
of
the
alcohol
and
i
know
its
definitely
in
there
very
very
tasty
mouthfeel
was
very
slippery
and
soft
swirling
about
my
tongue
and
sliding
down
my
throat
drinkability
is
high
very
drinkable
but
this
wench
of
a
beer
would
whip
your
ass
if
left
alone
in
the
room
with
you
so
you
better
watch
out
with
her
had
about
two
years
later
on
cask
and
got
juicy
grapefruit
hops
in
taste
and
aroma
nice
darker
colour
pours
a
nice
dark
amber
colour
with
a
moderate
light
tan
head
on
top
this
has
to
be
one
of
the
darkest
ipas
double
or
otherwise
that
i
can
recall
seeing
very
nice
the
smell
is
of
hops
galore
there
are
earthdirt
scents
scattered
throughout
and
a
hop
sweetness
that
is
present
as
well
nice
and
strong
without
overpowering
reminds
me
of
the
scent
of
an
old
baseball
glove
the
flavour
starts
off
nice
and
sweet
and
is
quickly
attacked
by
hops
from
every
angle
theres
a
dirty
earthroasted
malt
finish
thats
dry
and
tasty
sweet
hop
burps
with
some
pine
needle
notes
come
out
shortly
thereafter
some
have
noted
caramel
i
didnt
catch
it
at
all
in
the
flavour
or
the
smell
oh
well
its
still
damn
good
this
ones
9
abv
so
be
careful
as
the
alcohol
is
not
noticeable
at
all
in
the
flavour
id
definitely
try
this
one
again
a
nice
first
offering
from
middle
ages
for
me
these
guys
does
anyone
else
do
this
much
this
well
with
the
ringwood
yeast
wailing
wench
i
am
in
love
with
you
you
naughty
and
nasty
girl
the
beer
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
thick
offwhite
head
that
eventually
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
great
it
has
a
nice
malty
scent
surrounded
by
an
intense
floral
hop
arrangement
the
ringwood
yeast
adds
a
fruity
aroma
that
helps
balance
the
malts
and
hops
the
taste
is
good
it
is
rich
in
malt
complexity
and
piney
hop
flavor
it
is
really
bitter
but
finishes
strong
and
goes
down
easy
the
mouthfeel
is
good
also
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
beer
drinks
well
it
has
tremendous
flavor
and
complexity
i
love
this
brew
man
when
does
the
hop
worship
ever
stop
this
was
a
rough
assault
on
the
palate
malty
sweetness
in
the
background
but
the
overpowering
aroma
and
taste
was
pure
hop
goodness
color
was
reddish
in
a
dark
bar
but
very
very
attractive
the
taste
was
hoppy
and
slightly
astringent
and
roasty
but
ultimately
with
a
big
bold
hop
flavor
great
mouthfeel
as
the
taste
just
takes
over
your
mouth
and
coats
it
i
would
probably
end
the
night
on
this
one
as
i
did
last
night
because
the
intensity
of
the
hops
and
the
high
abv
leave
one
with
such
a
warm
feeling
hats
of
to
tim
butler
and
middle
ages
brewery
for
brewing
a
big
hoppy
beer
thats
not
just
about
being
bitter
a
nice
full
mouthfeel
its
drinkable
enough
but
mainly
hop
and
roasty
bitter
with
little
hop
flavor
a
great
malt
base
though
its
an
interesting
take
on
imperial
ipa
seems
to
be
much
better
on
cask
than
draught
which
doesnt
surprise
me
at
all
wench
beats
the
bastard
anyday
great
brew
i
am
in
love
her
name
is
wailing
wench
definately
worth
a
try
poured
a
deep
chestnut
color
with
currant
red
around
the
edges
and
a
tan
head
smell
was
very
hoppy
and
definitely
the
resinous
pine
cone
hop
variety
tons
of
forest
pine
smell
and
just
a
hint
of
malts
streaking
the
back
of
the
nose
taste
was
a
hop
heads
wet
dream
so
much
hops
i
couldnt
even
fathom
it
these
were
not
the
citrus
variety
straight
pine
there
was
considerable
malt
backbone
as
well
especially
as
it
warmed
tons
of
esters
towards
the
bottom
fo
the
glass
as
it
took
on
some
more
doughy
and
malt
driven
flavors
the
carbonations
was
a
little
much
at
the
beginning
but
as
it
warmed
up
it
settled
down
a
bit
wailing
wench
was
a
pretty
good
beer
but
i
think
it
could
do
with
a
bit
of
mellowing
and
melding
as
the
flavors
were
very
distinct
and
did
not
act
together
it
was
hops
at
the
beginning
and
malts
at
the
end
a
little
more
togetherness
would
make
this
beer
a
lot
better
also
a
warning
the
amount
of
hops
destroyed
my
pallete
so
dont
plan
on
tasting
anything
for
another
2
hours
drinkabilty
heres
where
personal
preference
rears
its
ugly
head
im
not
a
big
fan
of
the
imperial
ipa
so
i
wouldnt
head
right
back
for
2nds
but
i
enjoyed
1sts
just
fine
backwash
i
had
been
anticipating
trying
this
beer
for
more
than
a
week
when
i
finally
got
to
try
it
maybe
nothing
could
overcome
such
anticipation
it
reminded
me
a
bit
of
a
bigger
version
of
the
dfh
60
minute
and
no
i
dont
think
thats
the
90
minute
with
a
slight
diacetyl
note
it
seemed
thin
and
a
bit
unbalanced
in
its
defense
it
was
also
very
green
which
may
have
affected
its
drinkability
for
those
hopfiends
out
there
this
may
be
perfect
for
you
it
was
the
hoppiest
beer
ive
ever
had
and
a
bit
too
extreme
for
me
i
look
forward
to
giving
this
another
try
my
understanding
is
that
this
brew
has
a
limited
availability
poured
from
a
growler
6
hours
after
it
was
filled
right
into
a
middle
ages
pint
glass
it
reaks
of
hops
and
i
love
it
theres
a
little
citrus
hop
aroma
mixed
in
with
the
normal
middle
ages
yeast
smell
ringwood
it
poured
a
nice
dark
tan
head
that
soon
became
one
with
the
beer
shes
a
pretty
dark
imperial
ipa
deep
mahogany
in
color
its
all
hops
baby
best
dick
vitel
impresion
the
hop
bitterness
hits
your
tongue
quickly
but
stops
just
short
of
going
overboard
theres
a
certain
sweetness
to
the
hops
which
im
guessing
comes
from
the
combined
taste
of
the
ringwood
yeast
and
the
barley
used
definitely
a
quality
iipa
gonna
have
to
try
this
one
on
cask
i
bet
it
would
be
even
better
after
a
short
aging
ah
what
the
hell
do
i
know
this
is
a
great
beer
paired
with
spicy
beef
tacos
deep
dark
brown
smells
sweet
with
a
banana
like
aroma
smells
creamy
as
well
if
that
makes
any
sense
tastes
sweet
and
i
cant
escape
this
banana
like
flavor
a
chocolatey
aftertaste
only
slightly
boozey
the
carbonation
is
good
here
good
easy
drinking
medium
octane
beer
along
with
mac
and
jacks
african
amber
ale
and
georgetowns
mannys
pale
ale
this
is
probably
one
of
washingtons
staples
of
craftbeer
you
walk
into
a
joint
and
ask
for
an
irish
death
and
everyone
will
know
exactly
what
you
are
talking
about
theres
a
reason
for
this
it
is
a
fantastic
ale
it
is
a
beautiful
beer
inviting
dark
appearance
but
on
the
lighter
end
of
medium
body
goes
in
and
down
super
smooth
and
has
an
excellent
taste
of
nut
caramel
malts
and
balanced
well
with
comforting
hop
flavor
though
maybe
not
an
outofthisworld
knockyouoffyourfeet
beer
in
the
vein
of
strong
ales
nevertheless
it
is
an
always
reliable
always
enjoyable
brew
overall
a
fairly
nice
stout
overall
with
a
decent
sweetness
but
yet
balanced
by
a
good
deal
of
roastednesss
overall
rather
nice
i
had
this
tasty
brew
at
the
rusty
moose
in
spokane
a
few
months
ago
poured
black
as
pitch
with
a
foamy
tan
head
but
with
a
sweet
aroma
and
thick
malty
taste
definitely
a
sipper
but
an
excellent
one
hands
down
the
best
beer
i
have
ever
had
so
damn
tasty
if
the
location
i
am
getting
beer
at
has
this
i
wont
even
consider
anything
else
55
a
very
nice
big
beer
its
smooth
with
just
the
right
touch
of
thickness
and
deftly
balances
the
malt
sweetness
with
the
hop
bitterness
and
subtle
alcohol
heat
there
is
nothing
earth
shattering
here
but
its
very
tasty
and
drinks
very
easily
poured
into
a
seattle
beer
week
pint
glass
pours
a
very
dark
mahogany
brown
with
very
little
light
transmission
and
a
half
finger
light
brown
head
with
good
retention
and
lacing
nice
aroma
of
toasted
malt
chocolate
hints
of
coffee
and
vanilla
flavor
starts
similar
to
the
aroma
with
toasted
malt
chocolate
and
nuts
with
a
lighter
fruit
element
quickly
developing
to
finish
with
dark
malt
light
cherry
and
berry
juice
chocolate
and
a
light
tartness
in
the
finish
medium
bodied
with
bright
carbonation
a
beefed
up
brown
ale
with
an
interesting
flavor
progression
from
almost
a
nut
brown
into
a
lighter
slightly
tart
brown
the
abv
is
well
covered
probably
explaining
the
demise
of
the
quilter
interesting
and
im
long
overdue
reviewing
this
local
classic
overall
above
average
to
good
beer
that
somewhat
defies
categorization
has
some
stout
aspects
and
a
few
characteristics
of
a
strong
ale
its
worth
a
try
no
matter
how
you
classify
it
this
beer
is
described
on
the
label
as
dark
smooth
ale
but
i
still
enjoyed
my
bomber
of
it

off

the
flavor
changed
and
i
was
able

its

personally
this

and
a
little

boozy
to
really
be
an
easy
drinker
i
dont
think
i
would
get
this
one
again
as
i
feel
like
there
is
a
clash
between
the
sweet
malt
flavors
and
the
strong
almost
medicinal
flavors
of
the
hops
seems
out

great
testimony

an
ale
they
really
got
this
one

only

handle
a

off
its

you
will

this
is
a
must
have
i
have
shared
this
with

they
all

the

is
complex

once
it

gets

this

the
beer
pours
dark

with
a
thin
lasting
white
head
and
lots
of
streaming
tiny
bubbles
the
beer
smells
like
caramel
and
brown
bread
theres
a
touch
of
earthiness
from
the
hops
that
i
detect
in
the
smell
the
beer
is
a
bit
more
bitter
than
the
aroma
would
suggest
with
the
earthy
flavors
being
a
bit
more
forward
than
i
would
have
expected
i
get
the
caramel
and
bread
that
i
also
got
in
the
smell
i
can
also
taste
some
of
the
alcohol
the
body
is
full
with
moderate
carbonation
the
beer
goes
down
pretty
smoothy
and
it
has
a
nice

the
alcohol
this
is
a
very
good
beer

this
is
great
great
great
a
real
treat
its
a
matter
of
personal
taste
but
i
found
this
beer
to
be
a
bit
too
hoppy
at
least
initially
everything
else
is
right
on
the
mark
underlying
sweetness
floral
aroma
beautiful
color
as
my
taste
buds
acclimate
however
it
seems
to
be
tasting
better
but
still
more
hoppybitter
than
i
prefer
o
definitely
a
heightened
version
of
dga
with
a
more
assertive
flavor
profile
malt
and
hops
are
ramped
up
wonderful
thick
rich
beer
luxurious
in
the
mouth
one
of
my
favorite
strong
ales
this
beer
is
a
seasonal
release
here
in
the
central
valley
in
ca
every
time
i
spot
it
i
buy
a
bottle
this
beer
goes
down
easy
and
leaves
you
feeling
warm
and
fuzzy
this
did
help
me
get
over
losing
my
reviewing
glass
however
so
thank
you
ddg
hats
off
again
to
rogue
o
this
was
insane
i
dont
really
want
to
say
this
but
it
oneups
normal
dead
guy
from
all
the
right
angles
a
real
pleasure
to
drink
overall
very
good
beer
a
little
sweeter
than
i
expected
still
love
the
regula
dead
guy
better
than
this
i
will
definitely
buy
it
again
but
not
before
i
try
other
stuff
first
all
in
all
pretty
nice
i
am
glad
to
have
found
it
on
tap
as
i
recall
bombers
were
pretty
expensive
overall
super
great
beer
dont
drink
it
to
fast
enjoy
it
high
alcohol
you
surely
wont
notice
til
its
gone
and
then
you
want
more
and
a
nice
fat
hamburger
overall
very
nice
it
has
a
slick
fairly
clean
style
that
i
can
appreciate
just
harsh
enough
to
keep
it
from
getting
boring
assertively
malty
but
the
hops
are
wellplaced
and
it
never
becomes
treacly
overly
sweet
or
cloying
this
one
would
sneak
up
on
you
if
you
didnt
know
it
was
9
feels
like
an
americanized
stickebeer
and
i
applaud
the
brewers
ill
definitely
be
having
this
one
again
od
the
increase
in
flavour
with
this
beer
doesnt
seem
to
justify
the
double
label
it
was
tasty
and
clearly
stronger
than
the
original
but
i
was
expecting
so
much
more
didnt
seem
to
warrant
doubling
and
seemed
to
much
like
the
original
with
a
higher
alcohol
content
probably
wouldnt
seek
it
out
again
especially
due
to
the
price
tag
overall
the
look
and
feel
of
this
brew
was
outrageous
while
not
as
fantastic
as
the
look
and
feel
its
other
attributes
were
great
as
well
definitely
one
to
try
o
pretty
delicious
one
of
the
better
maltforward
brews
on
the
market
overall
enjoyable
but
doesnt
quite
get
to
where
i
expect
2
very
different
flavor
profiles
neither
of
which
are
standouts
on
their
own
and
they
dont
compliment
well
either

it
really
just
tastes

although
i
guess
technically
that
one
is
a
lager
and
this
is
an
ale
so
weve
got
the
caramel
and
light
frutiness
also
a
beautifully
clear

the
sweetness
is
evident
but
not
overdone
its
another
one
of
those

is

i
still

worth
trying
and
a
very

backup
d
quite
good
with

taste
o

would
pick
it

i
tried
this
beer
on
june
2
2012
after
purchasing
from
the
king
and
spadina
lcbo
outlet
in
toronto
ontario
canada
the
beer
poured
a
translucent
scarlet
red
with
a
generous
tan
coloured
head
the
aroma
was
sweet
malt
alcohol
weak
fruits
and
floral
hops
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
the
flavour
was
caramel
malt
some
fruit
cherry
a
little
graininess
and
a
bitter
finish
overall
its
a
good
beer
not
overly
complex
drinks
smooth
for
a
9
beer
pretty
dangeour
burnt
amber
colored
beer
with
a
white
head
beautiful
clarity
the
aroma
is
moderately
intense
with
breadcrust
and
earthy
hop
aroma
flowery
herbal
spicy
sharp
yet
smooth
this
is
a
great
smell
warming
but
the
alcohol
is
dangerously
coy
it
sneaks
up
on
you
relatively
low
in
carbonation
but
enough
to
cut
through
the
sweetness
which
is
substantial
to
counterbalance
the
hops
very
full
in
body
this
is
a
strong
exceptionally
good
brew
it
was
truly
double
in
every
way
and
of
course
shared
this
with
friends
making
it
a
very
special
tasting
looking
for
another
i
rated
this
a
5
because
it
deserves
it
i
salivate
when
thinking
of
drinking
another
beautiful
orangered
color
with
a
strong
but
pleasant
palatable
swallow
it
reminds
me
of
a
perfectly
mixed
cocktail
but
only
in
a
beer
balanced
flavors
of
sweetsourbitter
and
floral
friends
saidyou
only
have
one
overall
a
decent
beer
that
is
strong
and
sweet
with
earthy
notes
and
an
alcohol
presence
that
shows
through
in
every
sip
i
guess
it
fits
the
profile
for
strong
ales
but
im
also
glad
i
split
this
bomber
i
like
the
regular
dead
guy
ale
much
better
carbonation
is
a
little
full
on
odi
enjoyed
the
normal
dead
guy
much
more
this
one
is
a
bit
too
sweet
for
me
alcohol
not
masked
well
enough
but
i
drank
it
quite
easily
and
without
any
complaint
until
i
am
currently
reviewing
it
o
if
you
like
dead
guy
and
big
beers
then
you
will
like
this
one
i
dont
really
think
its
worth
the
1112
price
tag
in
my
opinion
but
definitely
a
good
brew
it
isnt
a
cheap
beer
but
it
is
very
tasty
i
recommend
the
bottle
if
you
have
the
cash
for
it
age
the
bottle
for
six
months
to
a
year
if
you
can
overall
tons
of
flavor
a
much
more
developed
and
complicated
dead
guy
ale
has
that
distinctive
dead
guy
flavor
i
dont
know
how
it
tastes
fresh
but
the
age
has
served
it
well
drinks
like
a
session
beer
bottle
received
from
liam
on
here
in
a
trade
done
last
year
pours
a
murky
honey
orange
with
an
orangetan
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
brown
sugar
and
some
herbal
hop
aromas
taste
is
the
same
with
the
addition
of
a
perfumelike
flavor
that
isnt
too
pleasant
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
average
beer
that
i
really
dont
care
for
too
much
excellent
sweet
but
not
cloying
very
enjoyable
im
actually
quite
pleased
and
a
bit
surprised
because
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
regular
dead
guy
ale
if
it
wasnt
so
friggin
expensive
id
probably
drink
it
again
rogues
beers
are
quite
good
but
the
thing
that
stands
out
most
about
this
brewery
is
the
fact
their
beers
are
consistently
overpriced
i
understand
the
concept
of
this
beer
and
love
the
smell
of
it
not
a
fav
of
the
strong
hoppiness
great
for
a
strong
ale
of
course
but
i
tend
to
lean
towards
lagers
and
browns
probably
need
to
sit
down
and
ave
one
of
these
again
and
really
get
into
it
not
a
go
to
beer
but
you
should
try
it
out
o
yeah
this
is
pretty
good
the
more
it
warms
and
the
more
you
get
acclimated
to
the
alcohol
the
beer
gets
a
little
bit
better
with
each
sip
overall
full
bodied
just
not
too
well
balanced
a
good
brew
just
seemed
a
little
off
to
me
cheers
overall
this
is
a
great
strong
ale
it
aged
well
im
glad
to
have
opened
it
at
this
point
but
im
curious
what
another
6
months
would
do
to
the
hop
character
vintage
2009
a
little
unbalanced
and
rather
tacky
bottle
too
old
boring
an
attention
getter
great
version
of
the
style
smooth
and
complex
nice
beer
o
one
of
the
best
strong
ales
ive
ever
tried
right
up
there
with
boulevards
sixth
glass
o
a
nice
strong
ale
with
a
good
balance
of
flavors
that
hide
the
alcohol
extremely
well
a
good
sipper
that
would
pair
well
with
a
sharp
cheese
and
crackers
overall
a
very
good
strong
ale
that
id
readily
drink
over
and
over
again
poured
from
a
22
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
as
usual
no
bottle
date
but
at
this
price
i
cant
imagine
its
a
fast
mover
the
look
is
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
large
foamy
off
white
head
the
smell
is
heavy
malts
caramel
toffee
and
alcohol
not
much
hop
presence
the
feel
is
medium
to
light
the
taste
is
way
different
than
i
expected
there
is
a
little
hop
bite
less
malt
than
expected
and
a
little
alcohol
burn
i
agree
with
everything
above
and
on
draft
its
on
par
with
all
the
other
beers
at
the
bar
an
excellent
strong
ale
food
pairing
spicy
chicken
wings
or
brats
topped
with
spicy
mustard
peppers
and
onions
this
beer
is
not
for
the
fainthearted
it
is
strong
this
is
a
beer
you
want
after
long
hours
of
hard
work
in
inclement
weather
in
colonial
times
i
can
image
a
beer
like
this
is
what
the
fishermen
liked
to
have
when
the
fleet
came
in
onot
bad
and
very
drinkable
even
with
the
high
abv
but
probably
would
not
revisit
again
cheers
overall
the
flavor
is
pretty
good
and
the
mouthfeel
is
better
but
it
simply
lacks
the
dynamic
complexity
to
send
this
to
the
next
level
i
would
be
interested
in
trying
a
fresh
batch
poured
slightly
hazy
redorange
with
a
tan
head
and
fair
lacing
smell
was
a
onedimensionally
caramel
candy
malt
bomb
taste
was
much
more
interesting
mild
citric
hop
and
caramel
sweetness
initially
then
slightly
cherryvanilla
flavors
gave
me
a
sense
of
bourbon
but
it
wasnt
done
yet
now
some
resiny
pine
appears
toward
the
finish
with
biscuit
notes
almost
reminiscent
of
gin
although
there
is
substantial
sweetness
here
throughout
it
somehow
manages
to
finish
reasonably
dry
and
noncloying
medium
to
heavy
body
with
mild
carbonation
overall
this
a
big
one
contains
everything
including
the
kitchen
sink
i
enjoyed
it
d
after
3
years
this
one
has
kept
up
a
nice
drinkability
and
flavor
still
very
enjoyable
o
the
original
dead
guy
is
a
great
beer
because
it
is
so
well
balanced
this
is
enjoyable
but
has
so
much
over
the
top
sweetness
that
it
is
onedimensional
i
was
engrossed
in
a
conversation
about
real
and
local
food
while
drinking
this
which
only
served
to
further
my
appreciation
of
this
strong
ale
im
surprised
at
how
much
i
liked
this
because
im
not
particularly
fond
of
dead
guy
ale
which
i
simply
find
too
sweet
and
candylike
this
offers
a
more
balanced
ipaish
approach
to
the
formula
that
finds
a
sort
of
harmony
between
sweet
and
bitter
o
this
is
a
powerful
fairly
forceful
beer
a
well
made
interesting
brew
dead
guy
ale
is
where
the
marriage
of
hop
and
malt
is
consummated
in
holy
matrimony
double
dead
guy
ale
is
where
the
two
experiment
with
wild
kinky
sex
while
it
offers
very
much
the
same
experience
as
regular
dead
guy
a
smooth
simultaneously
maltyhoppy
ale
it
does
provide
a
little
extra
oomph
thatll
put
the
zowsers
in
your
trousers
the
bottom
line
a
damn
good
beer
that
is
complex
and
a
belly
warmer
overall
despite
the
stronger
abv
of
this
beer
i
would
never
have
guessed
it
based
on
taste
this
is
a
very
good
beer
quite
tasty
and
very
well
balanced
certainly
worth
a
try
but
i
think
it
is
overpriced
compared
to
other
beers
of
similar
style
and
quality
body
is
a
little
heavy
and
sticky
and
the
carboantion
is
soft
overall
this
one
seems
to
be
a
little
messy
somewhat
enjoyable
but
im
not
entirely
sure
what
i
should
be
getting
out
of
this
one
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
and
rich
ale
it
is
on
the
boozy
side
but
it
does
not
dominate
the
flavor
this
has
so
much
more
flavor
and
complexity
than
dead
guy
i
will
pick
this
up
again
overall
a
good
heavy
almost
barleywine
like
and
bitter
brew
if
you
like
dead
guy
youll
undoubtedly
like
double
dead
guy
appropriately
named
o
glad
i
tried
it
interested
to
see
it
as
it
gets
some
age
on
it
beyond
that
nothing
too
memorable
pours
a
deep
burnt
orangered
almost
rust
colored
body
an
inch
of
foamy
white
head
develops
but
leaves
minimal
lacing
regardless
the
initial
presentation
is
very
good
smells
of
delicious
toasted
malt
floral
hops
some
piney
herbs
and
freshly
cut
grass
taste
emphasizes
the
toasted
malt
some
caramel
muted
hops
faint
vanilla
and
a
touch
of
alcohol
mouth
is
very
smooth
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
superb
finish
overall
just
a
great
beer
all
around
id
gladly
have
another
o
id
say
its
good
its
simple
but
doesnt
knock
it
out
of
the
park
a
solid
strong
ale
i
would
recommend
splitting
one
of
these
with
a
friend
again
would
make
for
a
good
winterwarmer
had
it
on
tap
at
the
cerulean
garden
in
winona

in

deep
copper

very
clear

head
smells
of
caramel
malts
and
some
citrus
hops
taste
is
malty
with
hints
of
citrus
full
bodied
with
good
carb
this
is
a
tasty
brew
with
a
very
nice
balance
between
the
malt
and
hops
overall
this
was
my
first
american
strong
ale
and
though
i
am
not
adverse
to
high
abv
or
big
beers
this
was
a
bit
rich
and
sweet
for
my
taste
it
was
not
a
bad
beer
just
sweeter
coupled
with
the
heavy
orange
peel
flavor
was
not
my
favorite
it
took
me
about
30
minutes
to
drink
because
of
the
thickness
and
richness
or
the
beer
ive
had
this
in
the
red
label
as
far
as
i
can
tell
they
dont
date
these
rogue
bottles
i
call
bullshit
on
that
policy
pours
a
deep
ruby
hue
with
a
tan
beige

i

steadily
pretty
solid
overall
a
beer
i
would
drink
with
friends
again
big
malt
the
original
definitely
more
friendly
to
a
palate
searching
out
balance
this
is
a
bigger
sweeter
hoppier
version

mouthfeel
is
outstanding
medium
bodied
with
just
the
right
amount
of
fine
carbonation
very
creamy
and
smooth
on
the
palate
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
from
rogue
a
simple
yet
solid
strong

that
i
would
definitely
have
again

would
have
this
again
fro
sure
o
i
very
much
enjoyed
this
beer
not
as
heavy
and
strong
and
in
your
face
like
most
american
strong
ales
its
lighter
and
more
enjoyable
overall
while
nothing
here
that
really
stands
out
this
is
a
very
rich
aggressively
malted
ale
quite
a
pleasant
drink
that
invites
one
to
have
another
in
fact
the
wife
and
i
kicked
this
growler
in
around
two
and
a
half
hours
the
9
abv
is
buried
by
the
malt
and
not
noticeable
at
all
not
one
i
would
aggressively
search
for
but
if
found
definitely
worth
trying
this
is
a
real
great
flavor
and
taste
i
like
this
alot
just
like
the
dead
guy
but
with
some
age
and
a
little
more
alcohol
content
very
good
brew
again
by
rogue
enjoyable
but
nothing
id
race
back
for
o
this
is
pretty
much
how
i
imagined
it
would
be
big
and
malty
i
would
definitely
say
this
one
is
worth
giving
a
shot
at
some
point
in
time
this
has
aged
very
well
the
hops
are
still
present
and
really
help
compliment
the
finish
very
smooth
flavors
and
great
mouthfeel
pours
a
lightly
hazy
dark
burnt
orange
color
a
foamy
cream
colored
head
shows
decent
retention
leaving
behind
soapy
lacing
that
dries
to
random
spots
and
flares
the
aroma
is
a
buttery
diacetyl
bomb
showing
an
overly
sweet
caramel
malt
base
and
astringent
bitter
floral
and
citrus
hops
the
flavor
shows
more
of
the
same
toasty
sweet
caramel
buttered
popcorn
and
bitter
floral
hops
thick
and
syrupy
the
palate
is
heavy
up
front
finishing
in
a
dry
biting
astringency
sadly
im
not
disappointed
as
my
expectations
were
pretty
low
to
begin
with
more
of
a
bad
thing
does
not
a
good
thing
make
overall
i
think
this
is
a
very
tasty
beer
but
perhaps
not
quite
as
intense
as
i
was
initially
hoping
i
dont
know
that
is
quite
double
the
beer
of
the
original
dead
guy
ale
but
is
still
very
tasty
i
dont
know
that
it
would
be
a
consistant
buy
at
the
price
but
a
very
nice
brew
indeed
m
medium
body
with
a
nice
chew
light
carbonation
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
kind
of
makes
you
think
of
beers
from
micro
brews
which
is
always
good
thing
o
middle
of
the
road
on
this
one
i
prefer
the
standard
dead
guy
a
lot
more
dont
think
ill
buy
this
again
the
bomber
was
pretty
expensive
too
i
think
13
bucks
i
like
the
fact
that
its
painted
though
so
no
light
gets
in
overall
a
decent
beer
but
some
things
were
really
nice
and
some
things
werent
look
and
smell
were
way
up
there
poured
a
nice
copper
with
a
brown
tinge
to
a
two
finger
head
great
looking
smell
had
butterscotch
bread
and
a
barleywine
type
sweetness
to
it
no
alcohol
present
in
the
nose
at
all
completely
different
taste
alcohol
way
up
front
with
almost
nothing
else
on
the
finish
except
bitter
and
dry
and
then
an
alcohol
residue
on
my
tongue
not
too
pleasant
carbonation
was
heavy
so
mixed
with
the
alcohol
it
just
didnt
do
it
for
me
not
one
of
rogues
better
offerings
overall
i
was
expecting
more
this
was
not
as
dominant
as
the
hype
had
it
built
up
to
be
was
a
good
beer
id
have
it
again
just
lower
my
expectations
great
share
with
spinrsx
notes
from
1272008
the
expectation
i
had
of
this
beer
going
into
it
was
that
it
was
going
to
be
an
imperial
version
of
the
dead
guy
ale
not
the
case
one
bit
this
brew
was
completely
different
the
beer
poured
out
as
a
amberish
brown
color
with
a
little
bit
of
head
on
it
the
smell
was
of
malts
and
had
a
little
sweetness
to
it
the
taste
i
felt
was
a
little
bland
i
was
just
struggling
to
figure
out
what
the
flavor
was
supposed
to
be
on
this
one
the
mouthfeel
was
barely
carbonated
making
this
a
little
on
the
flat
side
overall
i
found
the
best
part
of
this
beer
was
the
bottle
it
came
in
i
still
have
it
in
my
from
as
a
dust
collector
on
my
dresser
i
should
really
look
into
finding
this
again
and
trying
it
one
more
time
o
i
liked
the
2010
version
better
this
one
is
ok
looks
and
smells
great
however
the
taste
does
fulfill
my
hopes
or
expectations
pours
an
amberbrown
with
a
soapy
offwhite
and
chunky
head
larger
bubbles
for
the
most
part
that
leaves
some
sticky
lace
and
moderate
retention
nose
has
some
hops
citrusy
for
the
most
part
but
holds
more
malt
than
anything
big
caramel
notes
and
some
moderate
alcohol
taste
has
layers
of
toffee
and
caramel
sugary
with
some
candied
flavours
good
hop
bite
in
the
finish
light
bitterness
and
a
reasonable
malt
sweetness
good
flavour
albeit
simple
mild
alcohol
body
is
about
medium
and
a
has
good
weight
in
the
mouthfeel
quite
nice
and
a
bit
pricey
but
worth
the
shot
o
very
glad
i
had
the
opportunity
to
take
this
for
a
spin
its
not
a
bit
cheaper
as
i
would
love
to
session
it
again
definitely
worth
picking
up
overall
i
think
i
expected
more
from
this
beer
the
flavour
was
well
balanced
but
it
just
didnt
have
a
wow
factor
the
smell
was
very
light
and
the
feel
was
pretty
boring
the
taste
is
nice
and
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
however
the
similarity
to
the
original
isnt
overwhelming
but
i
guess
i
can
see
how
it
results
from
it
i
like
how
it
remains
light
and
drinkable
in
spite
of
its
weight
im
not
sure
which
style
this
would
fall
under
but
it
seems
like
a
lightdrinking
cross
between
a
double
ipa
and
a
barleywine
at
this
price
this
stuff
ends
up
being
a
little
too
boring
to
buy
more
of
but
id
say
its
worth
checking
out
at
least
once
if
youre
into
dead
guy
o
a
solid
beer
with
a
nice
balance
between
hops
malts
and
alcohol

this
is
a
fine
strong
ale
taste
tastey
caramelnutty
maltiness
but
i
thought
hoppy
hoppy
in
a
good
way
with
slight
alcohol
burning
finish
it
is
my
opinion
this
is
a
good
beer
i
have
tried
several
rogue
beers
and
this
rates
in
the
middle
of
the
pack
too
pricey
it
pours
a
very
nice
bronze
color
and
has
a
good
two
finger
head
from
the
750ml
bottle
it
laces
lightly
all
the
way
down
the
glass
the
imperial
smell
and
taste
is
the
biggest
strength
of
this
beer
i
will
say
it
is
a
bit
over
priced
for
its
quality
that
being
said
the
double
dead
guy
is
very
good
i
like
the
imperial
ipa
hints
and
the
true
smooth
drinkability
i
miss
the
musky
smell
and
flavor
of
the
dead
guy
in
this
brew
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
bitter
and
pleasantly
imperial
and
smooth
i
rated
it
a
little
lower
than
i
would
have
if
it
tasted
like
an
american
strong
ale
and
had
a
lower
price
point
theres
very
little
hops
in
the
flavor
this
beer
tastes
almost
smokey
and
bready
theres
zero
hint
of
carbonation
and
a
full
enjoyable
mouthfeel
this
is
not
a
taste
that
i
prefer
but
i
can
tell
its
a
well
made
brew
recommended
if
you
like
this
style
opretty
good
beer
but
at
11
for
the
bottle
probably
isnt
something
ill
be
buying
again
anytime
soon
o
good
beer
but
there
are
many
i
would
pick
over
it
more
often
than
not
more
complexity
would
but
nice
but
i
didnt
notice
the
high
alcohol
level
once
which
was
nice
too
expensive
for
a
blase
beer
in
my
book
not
impressed
didnt
want
to
pass
up
a
chance
to
try
this
on
tap
and
i
was
not
disappointed
similar
in
color
to
dead
guy
mahogany
with
a
off
white
foam
very
mellow
taste
for
9
0abs
had
a
malty
nutty
flavor
up
front
and
light
hops
on
the
back
end
i
did
drink
this
after
my
stone
ruination
so
that
could
have
skewed
my
palette
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
as
did
my
wife
who
is
not
near
the
hophead
i
claim
to
be
would
recommend
o
this
beer
is
pretty
good
but
i
just
cant
see
myself
or
anyone
routinely
paying
10
for
it
mouthfeel
is
full
and
chewy
also
a
little
resinysticky
from
the
aggressive
apricotcitrus
hop
flavors
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
but
not
for
the
inflated
price
point
associated
with
this
2x
series
from
rogue
i
also
like
the
original
dead
guy
more
and
if
i
didnt
know
what
this
beer
was
i
would
have
a
hard
time
comparing
itknowing
it
was
supposed
to
be
a
2x
version
of
rogues
flagship
md
light
to
medium
bodied
a
little
thinner
than
i
expected
going
in
for
the
style
pretty
easy
drinking
but
just
not
my
favorite
d
seems
like
a
balanced
beer
than
is
sippable
and
enjoyable
at
the
least
not
world
class
but
definitely
a
beer
that
is
worth
coming
back
to
the
taste
matches
the
nose
starts
smooth
and
moves
to
a
slight
woodiness
almost
a
bourbon
alcohol
finish
like
its
been
aged
in
barrels
drinkability
it
is
a
big
beer
and
one
bottle
would
be
ideal
for
one
individual
great
to
share
if
possible
but
i
would
rather
just
give
a
whole
bottle
to
the
other
d
i
love
this
beer
for
those
cold
gray
days
some
people
choose
to
grab
hot
cocoa
and
sit
by
the
fire
instead
i
grab
a
warmer
like
double
dead
guy
d
this
is
a
bit
boozy
but
solid
t
nice
balance
real
solid
its
just
there
isnt
all
that
much
complexity
its
just
sort
of
sweet
then
bitter
without
a
lot
of
the
complex
notes
that
make
many
beers
interesting
what
a
surprise
for
me
i
was
expecting
a
boozy
thick
mess
but
got
one
fo
the
bettter
rogues
that
ive
tasted
normally
a
7
draught
pint
would
be
viewed
as
expensive
but
when
22
ounce
bottles
are
going
for
over
10
at
retail
stores
it
doesnt
look
so
bad
d
the
thing
i
remember
about
2x
dead
guy
from
a
couple
years
ago
was
how
quickly
i
drank
it
it
just
seemed
to
go
down
so
easily
compared
to
before
when
beer
had
been
a
chore
albeit
a
pleasurable
one
the
inebriated
state
i
found
myself
in
from
drinking
it
so
fast
made
me
romanticize
the
role
this
beer
played
in
my
journey
towards
a
love
of
the
beverage
so
yes
the
alcohol
isnt
easy
on
you
but
2x
dead
guy
still
goes
down
so
easy
for
me
d
the
drinkability
is
good
it
is
a
bit
of
a
slow
sipper
for
me
but
it
goes
down
rather
easy
i
have
been
wanting
to
try
this
beer
for
a
while
and
im
glad
i
finally
had
the
chance
to
pick
it
up
i
think
this
is
a
good
beer
and
i
would
recommend
trying
it
thank
you
new
beer
distributors
for
having
this
in
stock
this
beer
is
not
for
sissys
strong
malt
flavor
at
the
beginning
and
finishes
bitter
in
between
there
is
some
fruity
characteristics
but
they
are
hard
to
find
given
the
in
your
face
character
of
the
beer
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
some
frothy
head
somewhat
harsh
mouthfeel
and
definitely
lingers
in
your
mouth
the
9
abv
is
definitely
apparent
in
the
taste
as
well
which
can
detract
from
some
of
the
complex
flavors
i
am
a
big
fan
of
dead
guy
ale
but
this
beer
is
an
example
of
more
of
a
good
thing
is
not
always
better
big
malt
huge
actually
malt
sweetness
vies
against
a
distinctive
alchohol
bite
that
is
a
bit
distracting
wavering
into
barelywine
territory
at
times
a
big
beer
but
not
particularly
engaging
i
find
myself
liking
this
beer
as
a
one
time
experience
but
not
enough
to
go
back
for
more
cool
bottle
nonetheless
this
is
a
pretty
potent
brew
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
this
beer
brings
a
lot
to
the
table
but
its
not
something
you
can
have
a
lot
of
mf
isnt
sticky
by
any
means
but
definitely
not
a
lighter
ale
all
told
a
really
quality
ale
that
is
obly
marred
by
its
price
the
alcohol
bite
at
the
beginning
is
fairly
annoying
however
as
the
beer
warms
its
very
pleasant
to
drink
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
tiny
head
that
recedes
quickly
without
really
bringing
any
lacing
forming
the
nose
is
definitely
quite
a
bit
of
malt
with
some
caramel
toffee
and
bread
the
flavor
brings
quite
a
bit
of
booze
a
lot
of
booze
some
boozesoaked
bread
and
a
bit
of
fruity
yeast
mouthfeel
is
dominated
by
booze
and
a
bit
of
sugar
too
boozy
and
not
really
all
that
complex
d
better
than
i
was
expecting
very
clean
and
approachable
im
not
sure
how
this
beer
is
fresh
but
it
definitely
holds
up
well
after
about
a
year
although
they
are
often
criticized
i
find
rogue
beers
to
be
pretty
good
and
they
were
there
all
those
years
ago
when
i
was
getting
into
craft
mid90s
that
said
their
beers
are
a
bit
overpriced
and
i
drink
them
only
occasionally
that
said
i
enjoyed
this
beer
although
it
was
a
bit
syrupy
and
boozy
which
i
often
enjoy
amber
colored
with
a
small
beige
head
caramel
dark
fruits
and
sweet
malt
good
drinkability
quite
high
considering
its
abv
however
i
was
in
good
shape
with
the
750ml
bottle
yeah
this
is
a
big
beer
a
little
rough
around
the
edges
but
that
is
the
dead
guy
way
right
we
are
just
as
much
proponents
of
session
beer
as
we
are
of
big
beers
with
this
bottle
were
asked
again
if
a
strong
beer
can
be
a
session
beer
2008
vintage
first
time
i
have
had
this
beer
wasnt
sure
of
the
style
but
american
strong
ale
seems
right
a
light
amber
color
with
mild
carbonation
pretty
looking
smell
is
a
little
hoppy
taste
shows
the
alcohol
but
is
nicely
warming
without
tasting
harsh
pretty
easy
to
drink
for
the
style
and
not
too
heavy
feeling
in
the
mouth
drinkability
i
would
say
is
quite
high
due
to
its
classification
as
an
american
strong
ale
much
easier
to
polish
of
than
say
a
double
bastard
im
sure
i
could
get
myself
into
trouble
quickly
with
this
one
to
top
it
all
off
i
got
home
from
work
today
and
my
wonderful
wife
picked
up
another
bottle
for
me
to
review
along
with
a
bottle
of
lucky
13
at
this
pace
im
going
to
clean
out
my
local
world
market
and
go
broke
from
all
the
world
class
beer
they
carry
i
love
it
one
of
my
favorite
beers
i
have
ever
had
hence
the
disappointment
in
its
apparent
cancellation
damn
the
good
always
die
young
pours
a
deep
copper
color
with
a
nice
twofinger
head
that
sticks
around
citrus
aroma
is
really
dominant
and
the
taste
is
all
fruit
tookinda
reminded
me
of
hawaiian
punch
a
terrible
analogy
for
beer
but
it
was
what
kept
coming
to
mind
while
drinking
this
has
a
bit
of
spice
at
the
end
this
is
an
extremely
drinkable
beer
and
im
glad
i
had
a
chance
to
try
before
it
is
all
gone
make
no
mistake
there
is
a
lot
to
like
with
this
beer
and
i
happily
emptied
the
whole
bottle
but
i
feel
that
a
more
delicate
touch
would
have
been
appreciated
overall
a
slight
disappointment
i
had
high
hopes
given
my
love
of
dead
guy
ale
for
the
price
there
are
other
beers
that
i
would
recommend
over
this
one
despite
writing
that
i
still
enjoyed
the
beer
and
am
glad
i
tried
it
i
really
enjoy
the
combination
of
sweet
and
savory
flavors
here
it
really
makes
it
a
perfect
drink
to
sit
and
relax
with
as
expected
warmth
brought
along
softer
malt
complexity
and
brought
down
a
touch
of
tart
sweetness
that
existed
up
front
now
closer
to
cellar
temperature
this
beer
is
in
a
league
of
its
own
vintage
2008
tasted
from
22oz
bottle
at
lush
west
town
pours
cloudy

with
a
thin
but
lasting

is

with
orange
peel
brown
sugar
and
a
bitter
finish
full
bodied
with

carbonation
and
a
long
finish
drinkability
smooth
beer
after
a
year
but
not
my
favorite
nice
job
rogue
another
homerun
while
this
is
a
decent
beer
i
think
i
prefer
the
original
unfortunately
i
think
they
missed
the
mark
on
this
one
d
as
drinkable
as
regular
dead
guy
just
amped
up
a
bit
i
think
dead
guy
is
a
beer
that
pleases
a
lot
of
people
including
those
that
are
not
big
beer
drinkers
this
is
dead
guy
on
steroids
for
the
beer
lover
drinkability
a
sipping
beer
that
loses
flavor
relatively
quickly
not
worth
the
price
stick
to
the
original
dead
guy
pour
resulted
in
a
huge
offtan
head
with
outstanding
retention
color
was
a
deep
copper
with
neplus
quality
clarity
nose
had
the
standard
rogue
yeastiness
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
a
bit
more
hoppiness
than
standard
dead
guy
finish
had
a
slightly
honeyike
sweetness
to
offset
the
bitterness
d
not
all
that
great
really
just
not
enough
going
on
or
it
its
not
a
horrible
beer
though
double
dead
guy
the
easily
identifiable
red
750ml
bottle
that
catches
your
attention
no
matter
how
hard
you
try
to
ignore
it
poured
into
a
snifter
it
appears
a
hazed
orange
amber
color
with
a
finger
of
slightly
yellow
stained
creamy
head
that
receeds
slowly
leaving
patches
of
lace
about
the
glass
aroma
is
sweet
malt
almost
candylike
with
a
touch
of
hops
that
are
both
citrusy
and
herbal
alcohol
comes
through
just
a
bit
in
the
scent
as
well
taste
is
bitter
with
a
faint
malty
grain
sweetness
that
gets
a
little
spicey
towards
the
finish
as
the
9
alcohol
comes
through
there
is
a
lingering
flavor
left
from
the
alcohol
that
elevates
the
flavor
of
the
hops
without
getting
out
of
control
with
the
bitterness
light
feel
with
a
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
overall
pretty
decent
but
was
expecting
a
bit
more
out
of
the
double
aspect
i
enjoyed
the
aroma
of
this
brew
more
than
the
taste
which
is
unfortunate
not
being
a
big
fan
of
the
normal
dead
guy
ale
this
one
is
a
little
better
but
still
not
something
i
would
buy
again
also
if
youre
into
collecting
bottles
as
i
am
pick
this
one
up
i
can
definitely
see
the
barley
wine
comparison
it
is
not
really
my
thing
and
the
scoring
may
show
that
but
if
the
features
i
have
listed
resonate
with
you
then
i
say
go
for
it
youll
love
it
taste
intense
grapeskin
bitterness
up
front
which
melds
nicely
into
juicy
semisweet
plums
and
rich
caramel
a
nice
indeterminate
spicy
bite
is
pleasant
and
a
dry
bitterness
underlies
the
whole
works
very
smooth
with
all
the
parts
working
effortlessly
together
the
finish
is
pretty
dry
with
some
residual
grassy
grapeskin
notes
and
spice
a
nice
honey
note
as
it
warms
and
is
quite
reminiscent
of
a
barleywine
very
solid
strong
ale
doesnt
rival
arrogant
bastard
or
sublimely
self
righteous
but
a
very
solid
brew
if
im
considering
that
this
is
a
take
on
a
bock
i
like
it
quite
a
bit
not
my
first
choice
of
beers
to
age
regardless
it
holds
up
well
and
is
very
easy
to
drink
while
stomping
some
mario
3
rouges
double
dead
guy
ale
poured
an
amber
color
with
not
too
much
of
a
head
it
smelt
of
hops
and
some
other
spices
it
had
an
expetinal
taste
it
was
bitter
but
not
too
much
it
had
lots
of
different
flavors
but
nothing
overpowered
it
had
a
great
blend
of
everything
it
was
however
a
bit
hard
to
drink
more
then
one
overall
it
was
very
good
a
must
try
a
big
tasty
beer
with
lots
going
on
well
worth
a
try
d
not
a
bad
beer
and
easy
to
drink
for
9
abv
its
big
down
fall
is
how
close
it
is
to
dead
guy
ale
with
just
a
little
more
alcohol
i
did
enjoy
the
beer
but
i
think
i
will
just
stick
with
the
regular
dead
guy
ale
because
it
is
cheap
easier
to
find
and
just
as
good
mf
for
a
9
abv
very
light
slightly
watery
the
body
was
decent
but
a
little
too
thin
with
a
lingering
finish
drinkability
was
decent
and
will
very
much
depend
on
how
much
you
like
the
taste
overall
a
decent
beer
that
i
sort
of
like
i
hate
the
regular
dead
guy
it
tastes
like
it
has
an
actual
dead
guy
in
it
but
enjoy
one
of
these
every
so
often
taste
is
malty
sweet
with
a
fairly
generous
amount
of
bittering
leafy
hops
and
toasty
malt
not
much
hop
flavor
here
pacman
yeast
is
discernable
and
provides
a
biscuitybread
flavor
some
medium
fruits
come
on
in
the
middle
guava
pineapple
and
raisins
the
burnt
biscuit
aspect
is
still
the
dominant
flavor
though
not
bad
it
kinda
grows
on
me
as
the
bomber
depletes
still
just
an
ok
beer
alcohol
is
big
on
it
and
the
flavors
are
all
just
a
bit
too
toasty
for
me
also
not
a
huge
fan
of
rogues
yeast
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
heavier
side
and
carbonation
is
moderate
drinkability
is
pretty
good
it
had
some
nice
malt
and
hops
flavors
reminds
me
more
of
an
american
barleywine
then
anything
else
after
a
small
sample
i
was
done
with
this
one
i
love
dead
guy
ale
as
a
unique
flavored
brew
and
a
lot
of
that
is
present
here
as
well
in
perhaps
a
too
hopped
up
variety
overall
this
beer
is
slightly
how
i
expected
it
but
in
many
ways
not
what
i
expected
specifically
much
less
hop
presence
than
i
expected
being
rogue
and
all
it
was
also
heavier
on
the
mouth
and
less
sweet
and
the
booze
was
actually
hidden
pretty
well
it
is
pretty
good
fresh
now
i
will
have
to
get
a
bottle
or
two
to
age
not
as
hoppy
as
i
expected
but
easy
to
drink
with
a
good
ale
taste
no
metallic
aftertaste
great
beer
for
the
ontap
special
d
one
bomber
in
a
night
will
do
this
is
definitely
one
to
have
but
not
one
to
over
do
in
a
night
considering
its
abv
this
is
very
drinkable
this
is
the
2009
vintage
pours
a
mediumdark
amber
body
with
a
thick
yellowtinted
white
head
aromas
of
caramel
syrup
and
oak
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
full
bodied
with
a
medium
carbonation
level
thick
malt
flavor
with
a
puckering
wood
flavor
a
little
heavy
in
the
oak
department
but
still
good
i
feel
the
hop
flavors
are
overshadowed
by
the
woodiness
overall
an
interesting
beer
rogue
double
dead
guy
2009
is
a
very
clear
dense
and
sparkling
amber
ale
with
a
huge
foamy
yellowish
offwhite
head
that
stays
put
it
has
a
slightly
sweet
resiny
aroma
with
notes
of
pine
citrus
and
biscuits
the
aroma
is
muffled
by
the
head
at
first
but
pepper
and
molasses
notes
come
out
later
its
pretty
full
bodied
and
incrediby
smooth
and
silky
with
a
pretty
clean
finish
its
nicely
balanced
with
a
pine
and
citrus
bitterness
and
a
slighty
sweet
and
bready
malt
theres
a
pronounced
toastiness
to
it
it
has
no
faults
to
speak
of
its
thoroughly
enjoyable
d
this
one
just
dont
seem
to
come
together
poured
from
750ml
bottle
to
pint
glass
rustlike
color
with
a
light
brown
2
finger
head
i
got
aromas
of
caramel
malt
with
slight
citrusy
hops
the
taste
is
more
caramel
more
citrus
from
the
hops
and
also
a
slight
mettalic
flavor
on
the
tongue
not
a
lot
but
could
be
a
defect
this
beer
is
smooth
and
very
drinkable
despite
its
abvs
theres
a
reason
this
brew
is
sold
in
bombers
its
because
that
is
all
you
need
to
really
enjoy
an
evening
i
certainly
recommend
this
to
friends
if
you
havent
been
lucky
enough
to
enjoy
a
bottle
you
really
shouldnt
wait
any
longer
i
have
a
2008
and
another
2009
im
cellaring
for
a
vertical
sampling
i
think
six
bottles
should
suffice
that
will
put
the
sampling
to
take
place
in
fall
of
2013
i
can
hardly
wait
i
thought
it
was
a
good
drinkable
beer
for
the
reason
for
the
season
d
after
a
few
sips
the
9
does
kick
in
maybe
needs
to
be
hidden
a
bit
more
i
like
carmel
so
this
is
up
my
alley
in
a
big
way
may
not
be
with
everybody
else
though
very
good
beer
with
a
lot
of
flavor
and
backbone
one
is
enough
but
woudl
seek
out
more
than
a
few
times
being
away
from
the
us
and
having
mainly
rouge
available
here
i
can
see
how
people
get
tired
of
their
stuff
the
yeast
strain
really
becomes
obvious
still
i
like
this
beer
a
little
over
priced
not
rogues
fault
though
i
think
this
would
cellar
quite
well
dead
guy
ale
has
been
my
favorite
from
rogue
for
a
while
now
and
this
has
totally
passed
it
not
as
drinkable
as
dead
guy
but
far
superior
in
almost
every
other
way
pours
an
orangishreddish
copper
with
a
big
and
fizzy
tan
head
aromas
are
sweet
caramel
with
a
touch
of
pine
and
grass
and
a
hint
of
oranges
flavor
is
very
sweet
and
malty
has
a
lot
of
caramel
a
touch
of
orange
and
grassy
hops
and
an
overwhelming
alcohol
presence
that
creates
warmth
and
buries
some
of
the
flavors
d
bold
body
and
hardly
noticeable
alcohol
drinkability
is
high
carajo
d
this
is
smooth
and
delicious
the
high
abv
is
not
unnoticed
two
is
enough
if
im
drinking
responsibly
otherwise
i
could
keep
drinking
them
ideas
from
fellow
taster
double
dead
guy
actually
tastes
like
a
fairly
simple
beer
to
me
although
i
have
trouble
pinpointing
the
specifics
its
a
dark
orange
color
and
a
tan
head
but
with
little
lacing
a
sweet
caramel
smell
is
there
and
its
also
present
in
the
taste
i
actually
liked
this
better
when
it
was
colder
45
degrees
i
find
this
brew
surprisingly
drinkable
and
would
actually
default
to
that
word
to
describe
it
d
this
beer
drink
more
like
a
barleywine
light
at
a
lower
abv
this
would
be
very
sessionable
but
at
10
i
have
a
hard
time
finishing
a
bomber
overall
very
enjoyable
received
a
fresh
bottle
for
christmas
and
shared
it
shortly
thereafter
with
friends
while
this
beer
was
tasty
id
like
to
see
how
this
beer
tastes
in
a
year
or
two
the
flavor
is
a
nice
mix
of
raisin
and
fig
fruit
notes
with
a
hoppy
citrus
hit
but
its
fairly
simple
for
such
a
big
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
appropriately
thick
but
not
too
syrupy
and
if
this
brew
had
more
depth
itd
be
a
fantastic
dessert
or
latenight
beer
drinkability
really
dont
care
for
this
one
at
all
the
harsh
grainy
flavors
clash
with
the
medicinal
elements
and
the
overall
booziness
just
doesnt
bring
this
together
for
me
pours
cloudy
orange
with
a
huge
white
head
aroma
is
malty
sweetness
withe
some
fruit
flavor
is
very
fruity
with
a
good
malt
backbone
and
enough
hops
to
keep
the
beer
from
being
overly
sweet
medium
mouthfeel
and
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
i
have
had
this
before
and
enjoyed
it
better
this
time
ive
still
been
meaning
to
try
their
brutal
bitter
but
i
continue
to
be
apathetic
towards
most
of
the
rogue
lineup
with
the
exception
of
shakespear
stout
and
the
grossly
overpriced
old
crustacean
and
xs
imperial
stout
poured
from
a
bomber
bottle
with
the
year
2009
at
the
bottom
of
the
label
after
being
left
and
abundant
frothy
foamy
head
that
measured
about
2
inches
not
much
carbonation
after
the
pour
very
little
scent
other
than
a
noticed
sweetness
taste
is
very
pleasing
the
alcohol
is
present
right
at
first
making
this
a
sipper
for
me
brown
sugars
and
some
dark
fruits
are
tasted
along
with
a
roasted
malts
somewhat
of
cereal
taste
mouth
feel
is
pretty
smooth
a
lil
heavy
oils
drinkable
nature
is
only
hindered
by
the
alcohol
it
could
be
mellowed
a
bit
from
the
750
ml
pink
bottle
2009
batch
sampled
on
christmas
day
2009
the
pour
is
an
amberred
color
with
a
foamy
creamy
head
and
nice
lacing
the
clarity
is
quite
good
the
aroma
has
a
bit
of
roasted
caramel
malts
some
raisin
and
a
little
floral
hop
good
medium
to
heavy
mouthfeel
the
taste
has
a
little
bitterness
a
little
tartiness
and
a
dry
hoppy
finish
very
nice
brew
d
alcohol
and
slight
abrasiveness
slows
this
down
needs
more
sweet
notes
to
balance
all
the
bitterness
and
alcohol
overall
rich
smooth
complex
not
being
much
of
a
dead
guy
fan
did
not
expect
to
be
this
impressed
with
double
dead
guy
very
good
beer
mmm
nice
and
malty
with
a
hop
to
your
head
kind
of
finish
beer
pour
muddy
copper
with
a
thin
white
heaf
smells
almost
like
caramel
apple
taste
is
malty
and
hoppy
with
a
faint
hint
of
apricots
mouthfeel
is
creamy
thick
almost
a
syrup
drinkability
is
pretty
good
as
it
goes
down
soo
smooth
a
pretty
agreeable
big
boy
beer
which
justifies
the
cost
somewhat
i
suppose
what
with
the
eponymous
malty
maibock
all
revved
up
and
west
coast
hops
judiciously
even
sparingly
used
at
times
also
the
equally
elevated
alcohol
is
so
ably
integrated
that
its
hardly
noticeable
but
those
9
points
do
catch
up
as
it
warms
and
that
tacky
bottle
nears
its
end
the
mouthfeel
was
fine
and
it
was
a
great
sipper
of
a
beer
flavor
is
a
bit
more
punch
then
the
dead
guy
ale
a
slight
chocolate
aftertaste
roasted
malts
bitters
pretty
complex
and
full
bodied
very
good
beer
this
brew
is
nicely
carbonated
but
it
still
has
an
oily
slickness
this
adds
to
complexity
in
the
mouth
feel
this
has
a
strong
alcoholic
finish
outstanding
atmosphere
great
appearance
and
nose
full
complex
flavor
overall
this
is
a
great
quaff
d
extremely
delicious
verdict
double
dead
guy
is
a
weird
kind
of
beastit
seems
like
it
was
developed
as
a
hoppy
doppelbock
but
it
ends
up
too
leafy
and
in
need
of
more
citrusy
hops
id
be
interested
to
see
how
this
ages
if
the
hops
mellow
out
and
the
flavor
profile
promised
in
the
aroma
comes
out
more
d
i
like
strong
ales
i
like
oregon
but
in
the
end
this
tasted
too
much
like
northwest
rainforest
in
a
glass
to
get
the
full
5
stars
from
me
drinkability
deceptively
drinkable
for
9abv
basically
this
is
dead
guy
with
a
bit
more
of
a
punch
i
dont
know
if
its
quite
worth
the
price
compared
to
regular
dead
guy
but
still
quite
good
and
worth
at
least
one
purchase
drinkability
a
great
beer
but
not
that
much
different
from
dead
guy
that
i
could
justify
paying
so
much
extra
for
it
worth
a
try
at
least
once
but
once
is
probably
enough
notes
well
have
to
wait
and
see
if
this
review
gets
the
same
fate
as
the
previous
two
that
i
did
10
dollars
however
is
a
bit
steep
for
what
you
get
but
price
aside
this
is
a
damn
tasty
and
satisfying
beer
worth
a
go
dnice
drinkability
very
balanced
and
a
good
overall
beer
overall
fantastic
just
great
this
bottle
is
well
over
a
year
old
and
i
can
imagine
its
aged
very
well
reminded
me
of
dead
guy
which
is
a
good
beer
itself
but
the
senior
version
with
a
few
years
of
wisdom
under
its
belt
a
malty
treat
with
a
beauty
hop
profile
to
balance
it
out
very
drinkable
as
well
this
was
a
real
surprise
to
be
honest
as
i
wasnt
expecting
it
to
be
this
good
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
i
just
hope
ill
be
able
to
find
this
again
somewhere
but
this
beer
is
definitely
something
everyone
should
try
wow
i
liked
this
more
than
i
thought
i
would
i
almost
said
nothing
while
drinking
it
i
loved
the
hops
on
thissince
they
didnt
make
this
a
dipa
but
were
there
enough
to
bring
harmonynot
discordance
to
the
table
im
a
musician
i
would
say
this
is
very
much
like
a
doppelbock
with
ale
yeast
very
similar
malt
characteristics
i
am
buying
double
dead
guy
again
drink
is
very
good
even
for
a
9
abv
maybe
a
bit
on
the
heavy
side
for
a
session
beer
but
certainly
a
must
taste
overall
an
interesting
beer
i
like
this
a
lot
better
than
than
the
regular
version
but
theres
still
some
of
the
toasted
biscuity
malts
that
i
dont
much
care
for
all
in
all
really
an
excellent
beer
from
rogue
its
been
a
while
since
i
tried
the
dead
guy
ale
but
if
i
remember
this
double
dead
guy
is
just
miles
ahead
of
it
d
kidding
right
2
of
these
bombers
and
i
am
on
the
floor
telling
the
wife
honest
honey
i
only
had
2
give
away
your
keys
please
a
fine
gift
on
my
birthday
red
double
dead
guys
i
have
stryed
from
rogues
an
old
standby
for
no
good
reason
and
am
glad
to
be
back
needless
to
say
the
pour
was
a
smooth
redbrown
with
orange
edges
and
had
a
great
dense
creamy
offwhite
2
finger
head
with
lotsa
lace
the
aroma
was
a
hoppy
floral
quality
with
wet
smokiness
the
taste
however
bent
towards
the
malt
more
than
the
hop
which
was
nice
as
i
expected
an
extreme
hopped
pale
ale
instead
a
nice
strong
ale
with
toasted
malt
earthy
grainherbs
caramel
sweetness
hemmed
in
by
hop
bites
full
but
not
heavy
sweet
but
not
tacky
i
could
definitely
go
for
another
rogue
does
a
great
job
of
producing
a
nice
range
of
truly
solid
brews
this
one
is
exceptional
yet
another
great
beer
from
rogue
and
happy
to
make
it
my
100th
review
great
bouquet
of
scents
full
of
flavour
and
easy
to
drink
what
more
could
i
ask
for
being
a
fan
of
hops
i
think
it
helped
a
bit
in
its
taste
and
drinkability
overpriced
i
think
so
but
glad
i
could
get
my
hands
on
it
cant
wait
to
review
another
100
this
is
a
slow
drinker
it
seems
bigger
than
9
fullness
of
alcohol
malt
and
hops
will
be
tough
to
finish
a
bomber
on
my
own
guess
its
good
i
started
early
in
the
evening
seems
ive
moved
into
my
first
winter
beer
its
cold
enough
no
day
in
the
50s
in
the
past
two
week
and
its
only
october
d
very
drinkable
given
the
alcohol
the
complex
flavors
and
perfect
head
and
carbonation
really
help
break
up
the
sweetness
medium
body
with
a
decent
effervescence
good
slow
drinking
from
a
750
ml
almost
a
sipping
beer
i
prefer
the
original
dead
guy
if
only
slightly
this
beer
poured
a
clear
dark
gold
color
and
formed
a
huge
light
tan
foamy
head
like
a
float
leaving
a
latticed
lace
as
it
subsided
a
medium
amount
of
carbonation
was
present
an
aroma
of
malt
caramel
and
yeast
the
flavor
was
of
malt
caramel
and
pepper
the
body
was
medium
light
and
slightly
creamy
the
finish
was
slightly
sweet
a
good
beer
the
double
dead
guy
pours
a
deep
amber
with
a
thick
off
white
head
that
sits
atop
and
lingers
smell
is
sweet
and
smooth
nose
consists
of
malts
doughy
breads
and
something
sweet
that
i
cant
quite
pinpoint
smell
is
not
overpowering
but
very
enjoyable
quaff
is
also
extremely
smooth
with
the
9
abv
very
well
hidden
by
the
toasted
malts
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
i
say
the
drinkability
is
high
after
peaking
at
other
reviews
i
have
noticed
that
many
are
saying
the
abv
is
noticeable
but
i
disagree
the
complexity
of
the
taste
overshadows
the
abv
would
like
to
see
how
one
smooths
out
in
the
cellar
another
solid
brew
from
the
guys
at
rogue
poured
a
dark
amber
with
a
generous
head
that
slowly
reduced
to
a
lumpy
cover
the
aroma
was
both
hoppy
and
malty
the
taste
was
also
both
bitter
and
sweet
but
a
nice
balance
of
the
two
the
feel
was
medium
bodied
with
good
carbonation
drinkability
was
good
i
liked
double
dead
guy
better
than
double
bastard
but
it
was
close
i
definitely
want
to
do
a
side
by
side
in
the
near
future
d
a
damn

very
well
great

d
drinks
alright
but
is
really
alcoholic
and
fills
you
up
quick
fair
drinkability
too
easy
because
its
smooth
and
not
bitter
not
too
easy
because
of
high
alc
and
thick
syrup
feel
d
this
would
be
fine
if
it
were
12oz
but
its
a
bit
much
for
750ml
be
sure
not
to
drink
it
too
warm
i
find
this
one
very
drinkable
carbonation
is
right
where
it
should
be
and
i
wouldnt
have
guessed
its
any
higher
than
7
overall
this
was
yet
another
strong
product
from
rogue
mouthfeel
is
rich
and
crisp
i
had
this
with
some
thai
food
and
it
held
up
very
well
drinkability
is
good
i
polished
off
a
bomber
in
good
style
and
probably
wanted
more
even
if
it
would
be
a
bad
idea

i
was

the
taste
starts
somewhat
sweet
with

the
aftertaste
keeps
the
bitter

hoppy
flavors
there
is
a
medium

with
nice
carbonation
the

is
hid
nicely
within
the
layers

there
is
a
nice

a
great

wouldnt

medium

with
light

and
an
overall
creamy
mouthfeel
not
sure
why
but
i
found
this
extremely
easy
to
drink
despite
the
9
abv
and
that
the
alcohol
presence
was
definitely
there
most
of
the
time
dont
know
about
the
bottle
but
this
stuff
is
just
that
good
on
draft
something
ill
be
sure
to
order
again
d
i
didnt
really
like
this
one
it
came
out
a
bit
strange
to
me
its
not
very
powerful
yet
its
unbalanced
considering
the
hefty
price
tag
on
it
it
was
quite
a
letdown
drinkability
is
better
than
some
of
the
other
american
strong
ales
that
i
have
had
once
you
get
past
the
initial
blast
this
beer
really
opens
up
and
is
an
absolute
pleasure
to
drink
what
a
few
minutes
ago
seemed
like
a
oneoff
sipper
turned
into
something
i
wished
i
had
way
more
of
the
alcohol
warmth
is
there
at
the
start
and
the
end
but
in
between
i
started
to
think
i
could
probably
drink
quite
a
few
more
if
only
i
had
the
spare
cash
d
easy
going
especially
for
something
this
strong
im
giving
it
a
5
which
makes
up
for
some
of
the
je
ne
sais
quoi
of
the
other
aspects
the
mouthfeel
is
the
best
part
of
this
beer
for
me
it
is
full
bodied
creamy
and
has
a
satisfying
bitterness
the
abv
warms
my
belly
nicely
and
helps
shroud
the
poor
flavors
rouge
ales
are
consistently
a
disappointment
to
me
lame
beer
pours
a
light
golden
amber
with
ample
offwhite
foam
faint
hop
aroma
with
notes
of
spice
and
alcohol
something
sweet
perhaps
caramel
fairly
light
bodied
mouthfeel
is
smooth
with
a
bit
of
tannin
tastes
of
light
citrus
with
a
mildly
chewy
caramel
flavor
and
almost
like
its
out
of
a
can
theres
definitely
some
metal
in
there
on
the
first
sip
but
seems
to
fade
away
as
you
continue
finishes
quite
bitter
but
somehow
in
a
subtle
way
not
really
very
aggressive
hop
presence
great
effort
from
rogue
although
i
think
its
too
expensive
ill
stick
with
original
dead
guy
a
2008
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
very
dark
hazy
orange
color
with
a
nice
off
white
head
that
retreats
to
a
one
finger
head
the
head
has
fairly
decent
retention
and
leaves
some
ok
lacing
down
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
smell
is
kind
of
hoppy
but
not
to
much
kind
of
a
caramel
smell
as
well
as
citrus
reminds
me
of
the
dead
guy
ale
just
a
bit
stronger
obviously
taste
is
very
similar
with
the
caramel
being
pretty
upfront
its
also
pretty
hoppy
mainly
with
citrus
hops
the
taste
isnt
bitter
at
all
i
found
it
to
be
pretty
sweet
mainly
goes
down
smooth
like
the
taste
it
is
somewhat
similar
to
the
dead
guy
ale
just
more
of
a
punch
to
it
i
guess
pretty
good
mouthfeel
pretty
full
bodied
but
nothing
big
but
its
not
thin
or
anything
drinkability
is
good
considering
the
higher
abv
but
its
hidden
well
and
drinking
the
bottle
was
no
problem
overall
pretty
good
stuff
but
i
wasnt
worried
to
much
as
it
was
coming
from
rogue
ive
got
another
2008
bottle
so
ill
wait
on
it
and
see
how
it
is
compared
to
this
one
down
the
road
d
a
bit
hard
to
drink
since
the
flavors
didnt
meld
well
and
were
all
over
the
place
i
like
it
but
it
is
a
bit
pricey
12
a
bomber
is
what
i
paid
which
seems
a
bit
much
for
this
beer
overall
i
would
say
that
i
enjoyed
this
bottle
but
i
would
be
just
as
happy
spending
its
admittedly
high
purchase
price
on
a
whole
pack
of
regular
dead
guy
it
just
didnt
seem
different
enough
from
that
beer
this
is
a
beer
that
i
prefer
in
its
unimperialized
state
i
think
a
lot
of
the
subtleties
that
make
dead
guy
such
a
pleasure
are
lost
and
are
dominated
by
loads
of
malt
think
palish
barleywine
not
dead
guy
x
2
if
that
makes
any
sense
still
a
well
crafted
beer
poured
out
of
bright
red
2009
bomber
i
had
this
on
tap
at
the
delightful
roguepalooza
at
novare
res
last
year
so
when
i
saw
this
i
grabbed
it
excellent
ultra
smooth
ale
that
will
smack
you
if
you
are
not
careful
pours
a
nice
goldbrown
tangy
flavors
that
slide
down
so
easily
drinkability
witht
he
high
alcohol
levels
this
is
a
true
slow
sipping
pint
and
more
than
1
or
two
would
be
sufficient
in
a
session
overall
a
good
beer
with
clean
strong
flavors
not
the
best
from
this
style
i
have
had
but
a
solid
bew
nonetheless
dnice
beer
overall
i
would
actually
prefer
a
little
lower
abv
because
if
i
am
drinking
something
over
9
anyway
i
would
go
for
a
lot
of
others
first
but
this
is
still
a
commendable
effort
from
rogue
on
a
side
note
it
comes
in
a
flat
out
kickass
bottle
id
love
to
award
some
extra
points
for
that
but
this
review
and
the
scores
are
solely
based
on
the
contents
rogue
heres
some
kudos
thatll
have
to
do
this
is
really
an
interesting
ale
and
im
growing
very
fond
of
it
probably
my
favorite
rogue
usually
dont
review
beer
from
the
bottle
but
the
situation
presented
itself
the
only
view
of
this
brew
that
i
got
was
from
the
thick
sticky
amber
colored
resin
like
bubble
over
i
got
after
my
first
few
sips
it
smelled
of
toffee
alcohol
and
some
burnt
malt
the
taste
was
super
nice
i
really
liked
how
prevalent
the
alcohol
was
there
was
a
slight
mask
of
malt
and
hoppy
bitterness
but
the
alcohol
made
you
feel
like
you
were
drinking
something
important
mouthfeel
was
ample
and
full
feeling
but
i
wanted
more
carbonation
drinkability
was
very
good
for
something
that
is
9
the
bomber
went
down
nice
and
i
probably
could
have
popped
another
huge
on
drinkability
hides
the
strength
better
than
any
other
that
strong
that
i
think
i
have
tasted
just
go
try
one
and
for
all
those
that
think
rogue
is
just
soso
get
this
and
be
blowblown
quite
drinkable
but
definitely
a
sipper
to
be
enjoyed
slowly
d
very
easy
to
drink
beer
would
readily
have
it
again
pours
a
hazy
amber
brew
with
2
finger
head
very
mildly
carbonated
smells
nice
with
citrusy
type
hops
tastes
hoppynot
overdone
alcohol
is
there
but
definitely
not
overbearing
just
enough
malt
to
back
it
up
mouthfeel
is
ok
a
recommended
brew
would
go
very
nice
with
smoky
bbq
d
not
for
sessions
of
collegiate
rabblerousing
but
i
can
see
having
three
consecutively
and
passing
out
on
the
floor
with
a
smile
on
my
face
i
got
a
glass
of
this
at
marcellars
in
idaho
falls
idaho
its
a
nice
amber
brown
beer
wnot
a
ton
of
head
actually
pretty
light
on
the
head
head
burned
down
to
a
trace
within
minutes
of
the
pour
nice
and
half
hoppy
brew
with
some
nice
malts
i
taste
quite
a
bit
of
alcohol
and
not
as
much
nuttiness
that
id
like
to
taste
i
think
good
beer
cheers
oelergud
d
the
alcohol
makes
no
attempt
to
be
hidden
really
and
nor
should
it
that
flavour
adds
to
the
style
as
far
as
im
concerned
and
it
makes
for
a
pleasant
sipper
its
more
enjoyable
than
i
had
expected
which
was
a
pleasant
bonus
a
nice
release
from
rogue
i
still
dont
know
about
the
price
point
on
it
but
that
aside
its
well
worth
tasting
palate
is
quite
alcoholichot
even
at
cold
temperatures
there
is
a
notable
toffee
malt
flavor
with
big
hops
to
balance
but
it
is
nothing
in
the
league
of
a
doppelbock
it
is
a
freak
and
needs
a
new
name
not
sure
i
could
drink
this
often
as
it
is
a
standalone
solo
bomber
just
fine
for
tonight
though
this
has
to
be
one
of
the
alltime
great
bottles
the
contents
arent
quite
as
spectacular
but
double
dead
guy
is
well
worth
a
purchase
if
you
like
big
hoppy
creamy
beer
say
what
you
will
about
their
prices
rogue
almost
always
delivers
the
goods
drinkability
the
big
bottle
and
ample
abv
say
this
is
a
one
of
at
a
sitting
but
its
certainly
not
at
all
hard
to
drink
i
like
all
in
all
not
bad
definitely
balanced
but
not
necessarily
complex
this
brew
is
barleywinesque
but
lacks
real
depth
worth
a
shot
if
you
enjoy
malt
hops
or
both
this
is
one
helluva
smooth
big
and
boozey
brew
it
surprised
my
taste
buds
with
a
great
malty
profile
and
i
found
myself
begging
my
friend
for
a
little
more
all
i
can
say
about
this
brew
is
wow
good
job
rogue
keep
up
the
great
brewing
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
i
think
it
is
very
drinkable
and
it
is
a
telling
sign
when
my
wife
also
enjoys
it
and
wants
more
you
have
to
pace
yourself
because
of
the
abv
and
how
easy
it
is
to
drink
either
way
this
is
very
drinkable
and
very
good
good
good
good
kudos
rogue
engaging
peculiar
and
repeatable
poured
into
a
darkish
amber
color
with
plenty
of
sticky
white
head
you
can
smell
a
bit
of
the
yeast
but
there
is
also
an
underlying
sweetness
to
it
the
taste
is
of
a
medium
malt
with
some
bitterness
and
minor
sweetness
overall
feel
is
somewhat
thick
possibly
something
with
some
food
but
i
probably
wouldnt
want
to
drink
several
in
an
evening
d
dont
drink
them
fast
because
you
wont
enjoy
them
as
much
not
because
its
complicated
but
because
it
is
that
good
to
many
of
these
though
and
you
wont
be
drinking
much
else
for
the
night
mouthfeel
is
thick
moderate
carbonation
actually
pretty
drinkable
in
a
suicidal
session
sort
of
way
but
one
bomber
ought
to
be
enough
to
get
a
sense
and
appreciation
for
this
superb
bottling
and
bottle
notes
this
is
another
winner
from
rogue
i
like
the
sweetness
from
this
one
a
tasty
beer
all
around
cheers
good
beer
but
i
wouldnt
consider
it
the
most
drinkable
beer
i
prefer
their
stouts
more
than
this
im
glad
i
tried
the
double
dead
guy
but
i
wouldnt
buy
a
keg
of
it
d
overall
a
pretty
decent
beer
the
tea
flavor
is
kind
of
offputting
and
the
alcohol
gets
you
buzzed
pretty
quickly
which
limits
the
drinkability
d
i
couldnt
do
much
of
this
as
much
as
i
like
it
i
like
this
style
of
doppelbock
although
i
feel
the
flavor
is
a
little
onedimensional
i
wish
there
was
just
a
little
bit
more
fresh
hop
citrus
flavor
to
go
with
the
bitterness
so
that
it
would
help
to
balance
this
ale
which
is
so
full
in
mouthfeel
this
is
a
limited
release
hopefully
they
will
come
out
with
it
again
i
agree
with
some
of
the
other
reviewers
with
a
bit
more
age
this
will
be
an
even
more
delightful
brew
this
is
interesting
i
like
dead
guy
and
this
is
a
big
dead
guy
not
amazing
but
im
glad
i
tried
it
i
am
not
a
fan
of
this
beer
its
hard
for
me
to
describe
and
does
not
seem
to
fit
the
style
imo
something
i
would
not
recommend
over
so
many
other
great
dopplebocks
d
a
bit
harsh
because
of
all
the
alcohol
but
pretty
good
not
worth
the
price
though
very
bright
on
the
hit
with
the
bitters
coming
through
almost
immediately
slightly
burnt
slightly
syrupy
finish
d
if
you
like
strong
bitter
herbal
hops
this
is
your
beer
abv
is
well
hidden
however
the
next
one
of
these
i
get
ill
cellar
for
a
bit
to
let
it
soften
i
think
itll
be
better
in
a
year
or
so
a
must
try
for
anyone
who
likes
rogue
enjoyed
this
one
the
other
night
with
some
friends
pours
a
hazy
golden
yellow
into
my
6
oz
tasting
cup
with
a
heavy
amount
of
white
head
considering
the
cup
size
nose
is
hoppy
fruity
like
pine
and
grapefruit
with
hints
of
malts
backing
things
up
taste
is
more
malty
that
suggested
by
the
nose
but
the
hops
are
still
out
front
overall
flavor
is
nice
but
it
is
just
a
bit
earthy
body
is
medium
are
carb
level
is
medium
as
well
this
is
a
really
good
brew
from
a
great
brewer
is
this
a
doppelbock
an
imperial
brown
ale
or
just
a
double
dead
guy
ale
whatever
it
is
its
good
though
not
fantastic
nice
hopsmalt
balance
though
a
bit
astringent
in
the
summation
another
solid
offering
from
rogue
and
definitely
worth
a
try
not
a
bad
brew
i
think
10
was
a
good
price
compared
to
what
i
saw
it
for
elsewhere
but
doesnt
seem
like
the
greatest
value
at
that
price
of
course
the
first
thing
you
notice
is
the
awesome
bottle
after
that
it
pours
a
nice
deep
amber
color
and
formed
a
4
finger
head
for
me
and
still
had
a
one
finger
head
by
time
i
finished
it
was
pretty
white
and
rocky
and
pretty
thick
pretty
sweet
taste
to
it
and
it
finishes
a
bit
more
bitter
then
i
would
normally
prefer
but
its
not
off
putting
for
me
i
can
also
taste
the
alcohol
in
the
end
but
its
not
too
overbearing
i
still
prefer
the
dead
guy
ale
to
this
for
the
less
bitter
taste
and
definitely
for
the
price
i
wouldnt
buy
again
not
because
its
a
bad
brew
but
because
its
not
worth
the
money
to
me
but
of
course
i
would
drink
it
if
it
was
given
to
me
drinkabiliy
one
is
plenty
at
least
for
me
supplement
this
brew
with
others
of
similar
quality
and
characteristic
if
you
like
to
slam
down
dead
guy
ale
then
you
will
love
to
sip
away
at
this
one
the
flavor
seems
to
make
up
for
the
intense
hops
lacking
from
the
aroma
an
assault
of
spiced
bitter
piny
hops
wash
over
the
tongue
very
good
offering
from
rogue
i
enjoyed
d
wow
this
is
much
better
than
i
had
expected
exceptionally
smooth
and
very
enjoyable
it
definitely
warms
from
within
the
alcohol
bite
will
deter
some
but
is
not
stronger
than
i
had
anticipated
i
thought
it
to
be
highly
drinkable
overall
a
great
brew
not
sure
if
it
was
worth
the
price
tag
compared
to
other
beers
but
i
definitely
enjoyed
it
the
head
was
one
of
the
best
i
have
seen
out
of
a
bottle
in
a
long
time
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
was
surprised
how
smooth
it
was
for
9
abv
a
amber
color
with
nice
foamy
head
it
had
a
few
small
bubbles
like
a
fine
champagne
s
caramel
malt
sweet
t
very
smooth
bitter
on
the
finish
rich
with
a
slight
hoppy
character
overall
i
loved
this
beer
dark
red
pour
frothy
cream
head
malty
citrus
nose
initially
not
that
much
of
an
off
shoot
from
the
standard
dead
guy
slightly
more
creamy
mouthfeel
some
malt
light
toffeecaramel
strong
hop
presence
as
it
warms
though
improves
mouthfeel
gets
even
more
creamy
more
malt
and
stickiness
really
laces
the
glass
clean
finishing
alcohol
nonexistant
well
done
the
price
on
this
beer
makes
it
something
to
get
as
a
special
treat
its
big
in
just
about
every
way
i
cant
comment
on
how
true
it
is
to
doppelbock
style
but
i
think
this
beer
hit
every
note
the
brewer
intended
its
fantastic
and
worth
trying
at
least
once
outstanding
poured
into
a
pint
glass
a
cloudy
copper
amber
color
with
a
thin
tan
head
on
it
smells
of
malt
caramel
with
mild
hops
tastes
of
malt
sweet
caramel
and
a
nice
balance
of
hops
this
beer
was
surprisingly
smooth
for
being
a
9
beer
it
is
almost
too
drinkable
for
such
a
high
abv
this
one
goes
down
like
water
despite
the
elevated
level
of
alcohol
alcohol
presence
is
wellhidden
on
the
palate
or
perhaps
it
is
just
unnoticed
as
the
previous
two
beers
were
also
heavyhitters
chimay
white
and
flying
dog
wild
dog
weizenbock
either
way
this
one
is
quite
enjoyable
the
bar
charged
far
too
much
but
definitely
worth
a
go
d
this
is
a
very
good
release
from
rogue
and
woth
a
try
but
for
extended
drinking
the
normal
dead
guy
is
better
this
warms
your
insides
very
quickly
note
this
beer
was
really
expensive
its
a
damn
good
beer
but
at
more
than
three
times
the
cost
of
regular
old
dead
guy
its
really
not
worth
buying
again
definitely
worth
trying
once
or
more
than
once
if
you
a
man
of
means
ie
a
baller
d
good
beer
in
the
style
i
like
pretty
big
malty
beers
and
thought
it
to
be
smooth
but
maybe
a
bit
to
warming
im
not
a
big
fan
of
the
standard
dead
guy
but
this
was
quite
nice
more
drinkable
and
flavorful
than
the
standard
this
one
is
well
worth
seeking
out
rogue
cooked
up
a
winner
with
this
one
i
had
the
2008
edition
of
the
double
dead
guy
it
has
a
clear
dark
red
appearance
the
scent
is
very
light
the
carbonation
is
low
the
taste
is
where
its
at
it
has
a
slight
caramel
and
a
slight
bitter
taste
and
you
would
never
notice
that
its
9
alcohol
its
just
smooth
its
an
excellent
beer
to
enjoy
this
beer
should
be
marketed
as
a
strong
american
pale
ale
or
ipa
i
might
pick
up
another
one
just
because
the
bottle
is
awesome
but
not
for
the
beer
overall
this
seems
like
a
subdued
double
ipa
a
different
beer
and
fun
to
try
md
very
easily
drinkable
and
superiorly
unoffeensive
two
bud
light
drinkers
with
me
fully
enjoyed
it
well
done
one
of
the
best
rogue
beers
i
have
ever
tried
a
light
golden
with
champagne
bubbles
the
smell
was
kind
of
weak
but
i
detected
a
lot
of
wood
is
this
oak
aged
it
was
similar
in
the
taste
some
good
hops
and
still
some
of
the
wood
thought
it
was
really
solid
very
different
than
the
regular
dead
guy
this
is
a
dead
guy
with
extra
alcohol
and
hops
added
in
to
the
mix
it
works
in
the
most
part
as
it
bring
a
new
hoppier
dimension
to
a
fairly
malty
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
thick
and
the
finish
is
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
but
it
tastes
like
a
typical
rogue
beer
not
their
best
but
a
worthy
beer
to
try
and
savour
eric
d
this
beer
is
a
good
example
of
american
craftsmanship
in
beer
just
dont
expect
dead
guy
and
youll
be
fine
with
this
one
747414

overall
i
like
this
beer
if
you
like
dead
guy
ale
you
should
definitely
give
this
a
try
overall
a
very
good
beer
nothing
spectacular
but
still
a
solid
brew
would
definitely
have
it
again
the
double
dead
guy
is
a
dark
copper
ale
topped
by
a
finger
and
half
of
almost
white
head
the
aroma
is
massive
malt
richness
with
bread
and
toast
and
a
hint
of
melanoidin
the
taste
is
similat
but
with
a
large
dose
of
floral
hops
to
temper
the
malt
huge
bodied
doppelbock
that
is
truly
delicious
even
more
than
the
other
dead
guy
the
drinkability
is
definitely
effected
by
the
presence
of
the
alcohol
obviously
you
expect
a
bit
of
this
at
9
abv
but
i
think
the
alcohol
takes
up
too
much
of
the
flavor
profile
to
make
this
wonderfully
drinkable
had
this
on
tap
at
the
brick
store
pub
pours
a
dark
orangeamber
with
a
decent
head
that
settles
to
a
swirl
sweet
and
malty
up
front
followed
by
a
beautiful
citrusy
hoppiness
featuring
grapefruit
peel
as
the
predominant
aroma
the
taste
is
even
better
the
malty
beginning
transitions
to
a
beautiful
orange
and
grapefruit
bitterness
that
really
lasts
the
mouthfeel
is
full
rich
and
smooth
this
is
a
very
hearty
and
satisfying
beer
especially
on
tap
where
it
picks
up
a
bit
more
smoothness
d
tasty
goes
down
very
easily
not
too
filling
strong
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
good
beer
to
drink
for
a
long
time
as
the
name
implies
its
an
amped
up
version
of
the
regular
dead
guy
ale
even
though
i
dont
think
its
quite
as
good
as
the
original
a
strong
pour
gets
nearly
four
fingers
of
light
tan
head
that
receeds
in
a
couple
of
minutes
leaving
just
a
hint
of
consistant
lace
body
is
a
glowing
orange
amber
in
color
nose
has
hints
of
citrus
based
hops
sweet
malt
and
some
softly
phelonic
alchol
spice
with
first
sip
you
get
a
even
dose
of
richly
balanced
mineral
based
bitter
hops
malt
joins
in
and
gives
just
the
right
amount
of
balance
without
overtaking
the
hops
mouthfeel
is
smooth
rich
and
crisp
with
a
bit
of
thickness
hop
bitterness
does
flash
nicely
at
the
end
alchol
is
super
well
hidden
for
9
very
nicely
drinkable
brew
dits
a
higher
alcohol
brew
but
it
doesnt
taste
like
it
it
goes
down
pretty
easily
though
the
hoppiness
does
get
in
the
way
of
the
smooth
maltiness
a
dopplebock
should
have
nonetheless
i
think
its
pretty
enjoyable
surprisingly
hoppy
and
bitter
and
an
enjoyable
drink
love
the
dead
guy
ale
and
this
one
is
even
better
pours
clear
ruby
red
with
an
offwhite
head
delicious
munich
and
crystal
malt
in
the
aroma
with
a
healthy
helping
of
hops
creamy
mouthfeel
resin
and
pink
grapefruit
hops
in
the
taste
with
the
tang
of
the
crystal
malt
it
truly
is
an
imperial
version
of
the
dead
guy
d
a
nice
balanced
beer
maybe
too
easy
to
drink
drinkability
not
really
a
quaffer
a
sipper
fo
sho
good
beer
not
what
i
was
expecting
though
i
would
not
seek
out
again
the
price
tag
of
15
i
think
it
was
this
was
nothing
like
what
i
expected
but
by
god
its
good
the
alcohol
is
not
evident
on
the
taste
at
all
and
that
makes
this
one
scary
beer
because
its
so
easy
to
drink
carpenter
might
be
better
than
90
but
90
is
so
drinkable
120
let
me
down
this
time
but
is
still
nice
to
try
from
time
to
time
but
double
dead
guy
never
again
and
i
wont
try
tripple
now
either
poured
a
clouded
orangecopper
color
with
a
light
tan

nose
is
sweet
maltiness
with
hints
of
alcohol
and
hops
taste
sweet

a
nice
big
hop
presence
a
bitter
hop
and
a
decent
mouthfeel
with
a
semidry
hop
and
hints
of
alcohol
in
the
aftertaste
a
hyped
up
dead
guy
but
i
did
not
find
it
that
much
more
impressive
but
damned
good
drinkability
bocks
are
supposed
to
be
real
session
beers
and
dbs
less
so
but
still
quite
quaffable
so
in
this
sense
the
beer
is
a
failure
its
way
too
thick
and
boozy
to
throw
back
but
lacks
the
complexity
of
other
quality
big
beers
diehard
dead
guys
might
buy
into
the
packaging
hype
but
this
was
a
disappointment
the
awesome
drinkability
of
the
dga
is
lost
on
its
big
brother
but
hell
its
9
so
im
drinkin
it
oily
and
thick
on
the
tongue
chewy
but
not
a
choker
has
the
strength
of
a
barleywine
severe
a
sipper
but
a
good
one
strong
and
challenging
very
good
but
will
be
hard
to
repeat
d
very
high
im
scared
of
the
high
abv
though
great
brew
pours
clear
copper
with
a
big
persistent
white
head
smell
is
sweet
and
malty
with
some
fruit
notes
pears
taste
has
a
nice
very
carmelly
sweetness
bitterness
in
the
middle
and
through
the
finish
provides
some
balance
some
hoppy
herbalness
in
the
finish
also
and
a
little
warming
alcohol
nice
but
not
particularly
distinct
or
memorable
full
bodied
and
nicely
carbonated
overall
a
solid
and
enjoyable
beer
an
interesting
brew
but
the
price
likely
will
keep
me
from
buying
this
again
double
dead
guy
basically
says
to
hell
with
styles
and
if
a
style
must
placed
on
it
it
seems
more
like
an
american
strong
ale
than
anything
maybe
i
should
check
the
rogue
site
for
the
official
word
on
this
no
matter
its
my
kind
of
beer
and
a
damn
fine
way
to
spend
a
friday
evening
inside
on
a
chilly
evening
the
gorgeous
red
bottle
sits
staring
at
me
taunting
why
the
hell
did
you
buy
only
one
eh
glad
its
a
big
one
mfd
perfectly
balanced
and
complex
this
ale
had
a
nice
sticky
mouthfeel
and
at
9abv
it
was
extremely
drinkable
my
only
complaints
are
this
ale
should
not
be
billed
as
a
doppelbock
its
clearly
a
doubleimperial
ipa
and
at
12
a
bomber
its
a
little
pricey
to
get
hooked
on
its
not
one
of
rogues
best
brews
its
good
and
unique
but
not
something
i
think
ill
be
buying
again
kudos
for
them
giving
the
idea
a
try
it
poured
a
med
red
color
with
a
thin
off
white
head
and
not
a
lot
of
lacing
around
the
glass
it
smelled
of
hops
quite
a
bit
tasted
of
hops
also
with
a
bit
of
an
alchohol
bite
to
it
in
the
end
medium
bodied
fairly
drinkable
brew
its
a
little
overrated
if
you
ask
me
pours
a
hazy
orange
amber
color
with
a
huge
foamy
yellowish
head
that
resists
fading
sheets
of
belgian
lacing
left
behind
the
smell
is
on
the
timid
side
for
all
the
ingrediants
this
one
is
packing
light
and
hoppy
with
matched
sweet
malty
underpinnings
that
suggest
a
big
ale
to
follow
adequately
carbonated
the
mouth
feel
is
full
bodied
and
creamy
the
sweet
malty
flavors
are
fully
complimented
by
the
texture
a
piny
resin
character
prolongs
the
somewhat
dry
finish
scoring
points
for
complexity
this
one
is
a
really
easy
drinker
even
at
9
abv
the
alcohol
is
well
integrated
cant
speak
to
the
truth
of
style
but
ive
enjoyed
this
one
leans
towards
a
double
ipa
in
some
respects
on
the
pricey
side
at
11
a
pop
but
the
unique
bottle
does
sexy
marketing
proud
d
a
tasty
beer
indeed
a
good
balance
of
malt
and
hops
something
id
drink
again
for
sure
caramel

throw
in
some
blackstrap
molasses
and
a
little

and
youve
got
yourself
a
damn
nice
aroma
upon
tasting
its
really
hard
to
tell
that
this
fuckers
got
72
ibus
with
all
the
malt
that
im
getting
dont
get
me
wrong
i
get
the
hops
and
bitterness
but
this
is
a
malt
forward
beer
as
it
should
be
with
a
little
bit
of
a
hop
zing
rogue
style
its
a
very
enjoyable
beverage
the
malts
are
rich
and
bready
oozing
with
nougat
and
caramel
bread
pudding
comes
to
mind
as
well
in
a
ghostly
kind
of
way
its
way
too
easy
to
drink
for
the
octane
level
i
notice
the
alcohol
but
its
not
intrusive
and
really
fits
into
the
context
of
the
whole
beer
nicely
well
done
i
wouldnt
exactly
call
this
beer
drinkable
in
the
sense
that
you
could
sit
down
and
have
a
couple
bombers
by
yourself
i
would
say
that
you
do
not
need
to
be
anywhere
near
the
drain
to
consume
this
one
its
about
middle
of
the
road

me

with
a
mediumsized
off

head
and
a
bit
of

very
malty

nice
enough

didnt
knock
me

beer

a
deep
clear

color
2
12
inch
frothy
head
that
dissipates
relatively
quickly
leaving
decent
lacing
behind
the
scent
was
very
very
faint
i
was
expecting
a
much
more
apparent
aroma
though
you
can
pick
up
slight
hops
caramels
and
possibly
some
honey
taste
is
very
sweet
at
first
that
blends
in
to
the
nice
hop
bite
alcohol
is
slightly
apparent
however
not
overwhelming
and
mixed
well
with
the
beer
mouthfeel
is
nice
a
little
on
the
lighter
side
but
enough
presence
i
hope
to
pick
up
another
of
these
to
stash
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
sweet
with
sugar
cookies
lingering
tingly
finish
with
the
co2
but
overall
nicely
balanced
d
reminded
me
more
of
an
american
strong
ale
than
a
dopplebock
but
i
guess
i
can
see
the
reason
it
is
a
dopplebock
since
it
more
malt
focused
and
less
hoppy
than
most
american
strong
ales
it
tastes
like
a
bigger
dead
guy
and
although
i
like
the
original
i
dont
think
this
one
is
worth
10
99
a
bottle
should
definitely
be
a
sipper
at
this
size
the
richness
helps
to
limit
the
pace
at
which
i
can
drink
a
glass
it
is
very
smooth
however
with
nothing
to
disagree
with
i
could
drink
several
of
these
on
a
cold
night
but
i
might
regret
it
in
the
morning
overall
double
dead
guy
is
a
pretty
solid
brew
that
is
definitely
worth
a
try
good
drinkability
its
got
a
bold
but
not
at
all
overwhelming
flavor
and
the
9
abv
is
pretty
well
masked
this
isnt
how
i
would
have
envisioned
double
dead
guy
but
this
is
a
success
none
the
less
very
nice
generally
this
double
dead
guy
tastes
like
a
work
in
progress
i
have
another
down
in
the
cellar
with
which
i
plan
to
test
this
theory
regular
dead
guy
caramel
and
orangey
sunshine
hues
captivate
the
slow
tiny
bubbles
making
their
way
to
the
top
of
a
ring
o
foam
head
dont
care
much
for
the
lack
of
foam
sweet
toasted
and
faintly
sugared
malts
give
off
aromas
plums
plus
the
faintly
herbal
and
grassy
hops
thisis
one
bitter
dopplebock
72
ibus
astringent
at
the
beginning
of
the
taste
then
the
malt
definition
very
interesting
astringent
lmos
medicinal
hops
in
the
front
then
sweet
toasted
caramel
and
crystal
malts
in
the
middle
the
finish
sees
a
blending
of
herbal
chammomile
and
rosemary
from
the
hops
blending
with
very
sweet
bready
malts
lots
of
caramel
and
toast
very
clean
palate
for
a
dopplebock
i
wish
there
was
some
more
sweet
lingerings
going
on
in
this
beer
alcohol
seeps
in
on
the
finish
double
dead
guy
ale
pours
an
orangeish
color
with
a
white
head
from
a
brown
bottle
painted
red
the
aroma
is
pretty
mild
a
little
bit
of
hop
is
noticeable
the
flavor
is
a
bit
hoppy
with
a
decent
caramel
backbone
im
kind
of
surprised
at
how
mild
this
beer
is
flavor
wise
i
dont
detect
any
noticeable
alcohol
but
its
clearly
quite
strong
worth
a
try
but
definitely
on
the
expensive
side
is
this
double
the
malt
double
the
hops
or
just
double
the
dead
guy
surprisingly
rich
and
thick
light
beige
head
on
top
of
a
clear
amber
body
leaves
copious
lacing
and
a
gentle
swirll
brings
the
head
back
to
the
beer
very
nice
sweet
carmel
tinged
malts
and
hints
of
alcohol
taste
has
a
bit
of
hoppiness
up
front
but
the
malts
take
charge
fairly
reminiscent
of
the
regular
dead
guy
offering
the
difference
lies
in
the
alcohol
not
as
hot
as
a
barleywine
but
no
mistaking
the
potency
of
this
beer
mouthfeel
is
quite
smooth
light
to
negligable
carbonation
nice
drinkability
is
limited
by
the
alcohol
presence
it
is
not
overpowering
but
after
a
bomber
youll
know
that
you
have
had
a
serious
brew
tastey
but
not
necessarily
a
repeat
purchase
di
could
have
another
pint
but
wouldnt
go
much
farther
overall
im
glad
i
had
this
fresh
not
even
close
to
the
style
but
a
great
beer
nonetheless
good
version
of
regular
dead
guy
but
overall
almost
prefer
the
regular
version
i
wasnt
a
huge
fan
of
the
original
so
it
shouldnt
be
a
shock
that
i
didnt
like
this
very
much
its
well
brewed
just
not
for
me
too
much
of
the
sticky
sweet
side
of
things
not
wild
about
this
beer
very
expensive
10
for
the
bomber
and
i
just
didnt
like
it
many
other
doppelbocks
out
there
that
taste
a
lot
better
at
half
the
price
celebrator
anyone
mouthfeel
was
slick
and
had
a
medium
body
d
this
is
a
great
drinking
brew
perfect
for
the
first
cold
night
of
the
year
22oz
bomber
with
bright
red
paint
and
2008
date
pours
a
medium
amber
with
a
huge
head
good
longevity
and
nice
lace
subtle
aromas
of
malt
vanilla
and
yeast
with
a
mild
hop
presence
upon
tasting
big
malt
presence
with
vanilla
slight
sherry
and
decent
hop
flavor
with
a
decent
bitterness
i
think
it
is
quite
literally
double
dead
guy
a
good
beer
but
not
sure
its
worth
the
11
99
i
paid
for
it
of
course
its
not
a
beer
to
drink
in
a
time
of
manner
just
to
feel
the
alcool
take
it
slowly
youll
enjoy
it
for
sure
with
salty
side
pretzel
is
a
very
pleasant
beer
and
when
ive
a
chance
to
buy
it
again
ill
do
that
for
sure
very
drinkable
but
i
was
expecting
more
bang
for
the
buck
this
was
not
the
beast
id
heard
about
poured
red
with
orange
highlights
substantial
offwhite
head
that
seemed
to
rise
from
nothing
before
settling
back
to
nothing
nose
shows
alot
of
hops
and
malt
in
almost
equal
proportions
caramel
is
the
most
dominant
character
palate
shows
some
more
caramel
before
some
sweet
malt
gives
way
to
dominating
bitter
hops
the
sweet
caramel
malt
again
makes
an
appearance
to
take
a
bit
of
sting
out
of
the
aggressive
hops
shows
a
spirit
like
aniseed
on
the
nose
as
it
warms
its
ok
but
probably
not
worth
the
cash
most
will
spend
for
this
for
a
9
abv
this
was
a
very
drinkable
beer
but
being
that
the
double
dead
guy
is
on
the
more
expensive
side
i
probably
wont
be
able
to
enjoy
this
brew
that
often
the
beer
pours
a
dark
amberbrown
color
with
a
thick
and
creamy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
slightly
warming
burnt
toffee
and
roasted
malt
aroma
thats
sweet
with
a
bit
of
dryness
the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
dry
roasted
malt
flavor
with
a
warm
malty
sweetness
in
the
finish
it
goes
down
very
smooth
with
a
slightly
bitter
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
damn
good
beer
its
complex
and
flavorful
and
highly
drinkable
even
at
9
drinkability
theres
a
couple
of
reasons
why
the
drinkability
score
is
so
low
first
off
was
the
smell
of
this
beer
there
wasnt
much
of
anything
in
aroma
second
was
the
taste
there
also
wasnt
much
going
on
in
there
third
is
the
price
of
this
beer
holy
crap
for
the
hefty
price
tag
this
beer
carries
you
could
buy
a
few
good
session
six
packs
or
a
delicious
barrel
aged
beer
theres
no
way
i
would
buy
this
average
beer
at
such
a
high
price
be
warned
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
all
in
all
this
beer
is
okay
all
around
okay
i
think
that
there
was
more
hype
around
this
beer
that
what
it
actually
deserves
sure
its
good
but
is
it
good
enough
to
deserve
all
the
hype
that
it
got
i
dont
think
so
i
was
so
excited
when
i
heard
that
this
beer
was
coming
out
unfortunately
i
was
let
down
hugely
by
it
when
i
took
my
first
sip
now
ive
given
a
second
or
third
chance
ive
tasted
this
beer
on
many
different
occassions
before
this
and
still
it
doesnt
meet
what
i
think
it
should
be
concerning
that
hype
that
surrounded
it
this
is
one
that
id
not
buy
again
were
it
a
regular
offering
from
rogue
however
since
this
is
a
limited
release
i
might
buy
a
bottle
to
see
how
it
changes
over
time
and
then
one
as
well
to
use
for
trading
or
to
sell
on
ebay
years
from
now
hopefully
it
will
give
me
some
kind
of
return
in
the
mouth
the
beer
is
mediumfull
lightly
carbonatedalmost
none
at
all
what
this
beer
feels
is
almost
what
id
say
is
good
for
it
maybe
some
more
carbonation
would
be
good
delicate
bubbles
on
the
tongue
not
alot
but
there
d
a
smooth
easy
drinking
beer
i
was
surprised
to
find
out
that
this
was
9
abv
very
interesting
im
a
big
rogue
fan
but
this
fell
a
bit
short
for
me
this
had
a
lot
to
live
up
to
though
because
i
love
the
dead
guy
drinkability
all
in
all
an
average
brew
has
its
moments
but
nothing
to
spectacular
here
not
worth
the
nearly
10
price
tag
i
paid
pours
a
really
beautifully
clear
dark
honey
color
with
an
attractive
head
that
seems
not
just
to
sit
on
top
of
the
beer
but
fade
into
the
rest
in
a
gradient
aroma
is
a
lot
like
normal
dead
guy
a
little
bready
and
airy
taste
has
a
little
more
of
an
american
hop
feel
sort
of
like
a
barleywine
a
very
delicious
beer
obviously
well
made
but
expensive
as
hell
and
i
dont
think
that
much
far
above
normal
dead
guy
especially
when
it
comes
to
price
overall
impression
interesting
this
isnt
something
i
would
want
all
the
time
but
it
is
a
nice
example
of
some
interesting
flavors
you
can
get
out
of
malt
drinkability
very
tasty
and
an
ideal
way
to
wind
down
the
halloween
08
weekend
another
pricy
bottle
a
good
beer
but
not
worth
13
a
bit
cloying
and
not
a
beer
that
is
invitingly
drinkable
its
drinkable
but
its
not
all
that
interesting
i
love
rogue
and
the
creativity
displayed
in
most
of
their
brews
is
enlightening
but
sadly
this
is
not
overall
i
am
thoroughly
enjoying
this
brew
i
used
to
live
in
oregon
and
found
myself
becoming
quite
partial
to
anything
that
rogue
put
out
so
i
was
happy
to
find
something
different
in
kentucky
of
all
places
a
great
find
and
well
worthy
anyones
time
and
money
in
trying
and
you
do
have
to
pay
a
little
bit
more
for
it
most
certainly
not
a
doppelbock
which
makes
me
wonder
why
it
was
listed
so
in
the
first
place
d
this
was
delicous
i
wish
i
had
been
able
to
try
it
while
it
was
on
tap
in
town
d
maybe
just
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
but
definitely
a
good
drink
for
this
halloween
night
2008
this
one
did
not
seem
like
a
dopplebock
for
me
especially
in
regards
to
the
color
i
would
call
it
more
of
a
maibock
or
even
and
imperial
red
at
times
this
beer
is
quite
expensive
for
what
it
is
think
some
age
might
mellow
it
out
a
bit
and
that
might
be
needed
i
would
not
buy
it
again
worth
trying
but
pricey
heavy
bodied
but
a
slow
struggling
carbonation
stays
with
it
throughout
for
its
strength
its
a
nice
maltfocused
drinkersipper
but
id
like
something
to
stand
up
and
take
charge
aside
from
it
just
tasting
larger
than
normal
may
be
a
bit
steeplypriced
but
if
youre
a
fan
of
big
sweet
alcoholic
bocks
this
is
a
quality
one
so
a
no
brainer
im
more
inclined
to
stick
to
the
regular
dead
guy
ale
for
a
night
of
partying
2008
vintage
this
poured
a
clear
dark
copper
with
tan
head
it
smelled
like
sweet
honey
and
burnt
caramel
malt
with
some
grapefruit
hops
it
tasted
like
sweet
caramel
and
honey
malts
with
bitter
grapefruit
and
pine
hops
and
a
bit
of
confectioners
sugar
for
added
sweetness
it
was
oily
with
a
bit
of
carbonation
and
had
a
bitter
aftertaste
overall
this
wasnt
terribly
different
from
other
rogue
beers
i
guess
using
the
same
malts
and
hops
will
do
that
to
a
brewery
but
this
still
had
a
great
clean
flavor
that
hid
the
alcohol
well
so
it
was
quite
easy
to
drink
and
it
had
a
nice
body
too
so
it
wasnt
super
unique
and
didnt
really
seem
to
fit
the
style
but
it
was
still
a
very
enjoyable
drink
however
i
dont
really
feel
like
it
was
worth
the
extra
cost
so
i
probably
wouldnt
buy
it
again
mediumheavy
body
but
not
quite
as
much
co2
as
it
should
have
still
quite
alright
drinkable
but
i
wouldnt
buy
it
again
not
a
doppelbock
by
any
stretch
im
not
even
sure
this
is
a
lager
overall
an
alright
beer
in
terms
of
the
nose
appearance
and
my
overall
impressions
of
this
beer
its
about
on
par
with
dead
guy
for
whatever
its
worth
i
would
rather
have
the
normal
beer
and
thats
even
without
taking
into
account
the
double
priced
nature
of
this
offering
in
terms
of
doppelbocks
i
would
rather
pay
this
price
for
stuff
like
celebrator
dark
horses
percolator
or
less
for
locals
like
bells
consecrator
or
even
the
sam
version
nice
an
explosion
of
flavor
i
still
think
dead
guy
stands
taller
as
a
good
solid
beer
but
this
isnt
bad
and
it
isnt
lacking
in
residual
sugar
d
pretty
decent
offering
from
rogue
though
a
bit
odd
for
a
dopplebock
i
didnt
even
realize
it
was
one
until
later
i
enjoyed
the
brew
but
the
retail
price
is
a
bit
questionable
go
out
of
your
way
if
youre
a
big
rogue
fan
else
just
wait
until
you
happen
to
come
across
this
at
a
bar
d
this
beer
just
doesnt
do
much
for
me
its
a
little
to
boozy
for
me
its
worth
a
try
though
if
you
can
find
it
drinkability
is
moderate
its
a
decent
beer
but
nothing
incredible
id
rather
have
a
regular
dead
guy
bottle
bought
for
halloween
split
with
buddy
deep
burnt
orange
nice
head
smells
toasty
malty
taste
deep
malty
toasty
goodness
reminds
me
of
a
caramel
apple
alcholy
and
some
hops
finish
mouthfeel
full
frosty
creamy
carbed
drinkability
cant
believe
the
9
im
going
to
buy
some
more
sorry
i
sat
on
this
so
long
waiting
for
the
weekend
befor
halloween
overall
readded
to
wants
list
the
2008
ddg
finally
making
an
appearance
in
texas
i
poured
it
into
a
chimay
chalice
it
has
a
rich
darkcopper
color
with
a
quarter
inch
head
of
foam
the
nose
has
a
solid
malt
underpinning
with
a
floral
hop
aroma
very
nice
malty
flavor
rich
and
bready
with
a
very
light
caramel
touch
moderately
high
bitterness
with
a
flowery
hoppiness
but
emphasis
remains
squarely
on
the
malt
a
touch
of
alcohol
makes
an
appearance
at
the
end
but
not
too
much
big
body
with
a
smooth
texture
some
pineapple
flavor
fruit
punch
flavor
cut
by
a
dry
bittering
hop
light
alcohol
warmth
in
the
background
not
over
the
top
like
some
double
bocks
superb
balance
d
a
little
too
sweet
for
me
but
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
stuff
anyhow
9
is
a
good
abv
for
a
long
evening
a
solid
and
tasty
brew
but
a
little
pricey
and
high
in
abv
to
be
a
slynger
fridge
commoner
no
off
nodes
nothing
overly
bitter
none
of
the
syrupynes
that
plagues
so
many
big
hoppy
beers
this
is
definitely
a
bock
and
its
definitely
a
perfectly
balanced
hop
bomb
and
its
also
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
in
a
long
time
its
darn
drinkable
for
a
big
beer
at
9
but
i
dont
think
i
could
drink
more
than
one
the
buzz
is
already
upon
me
this
is
a
beer
that
i
will
drink
again
edit
i
see
that
this
should
actually
be
categorized
as
a
strong
ale
and
not
a
doppelbock
a
solid
offering
great
to
drink
with
a
wedge
of
brie
not
the
best
in
the
style
but
a
good
brew
try
it
and
enjoy
the
bottle
design
as
well
i
enjoyed
this
quite
a
bit
much
more
than
i
expected
for
some
reason
i
think
at
12
a
bottle
i
expect
to
be
blown
away
this
was
good
but
not
12
good
i
wouldnt
buy
another
at
that
price
pours
a
nice
dark
honeygolden
clear
with
fine
bubbles
and
a
very
thick
offwhite
and
fairly
persistent
head
aroma
is
strong
and
malty
with
undertones
of
caramel
and
hops
flavor
is
surprisingly
hoppy
with
a
good
balance
of
maltiness
and
a
sweet
undertone
there
is
a
fair
amount
of
bitterness
but
it
is
not
overwhelming
texture
is
smooth
and
edgy
and
very
pleasing
overall
another
winner
from
rogue
as
an
amped
up
version
of
dead
guy
its
a
good
beer
i
certainly
wouldnt
call
it
a
dobblebock
as
it
is
probably
doesnt
stack
up
to
the
better
dobblebocks
out
there
either
way
its
worth
trying
d
double
dead
guy
ale
clocks
in
at
9
abv
but
the
alcohol
is
very
wellintegrated
into
both
the
flavor
and
the
aroma
this
beer
is
a
malt
bomb
for
sure
but
i
never
got
tired
of
it
seek
this
one
out
i
like
this
beer
and
wish
that
rouge
comes
out
with
lots
more
of
these
great
tasting
beers
brilliant
clear
red
amber
with
thick
foamy
off
white
head
and
loads
of
tiny
bubbles
cascading
up
through
the
body
leaves
a
decent
lace
as
well
aroma
of
sweet
malt
fruity
maybe
plum
turning
a
little
more
earthy
as
it
warms
up
even
tranisitioning
to
a
strawlike
smell
toward
the
end
warm
well
balanced
initial
flavor
that
is
malty
and
keeps
a
little
of
the
fruitiness
from
the
aroma
nice
bitter
aftertaste
which
i
felt
was
pretty
reigned
in
the
malt
is
a
little
sweet
and
the
flavors
are
surprisingly
not
over
the
top
medium
to
full
bodied
with
smooth
almost
creamy
texture
and
only
the
slightest
hint
of
alcoholic
finish
really
well
balanced
this
is
a
truly
drinkable
beer
that
is
tasty
well
balanced
and
easy
to
drink
my
only
real
complaint
is
the
price
this
is
a
solid
beer
but
it
is
more
than
double
the
typical
americanbrewed
bomber
there
are
some
beers
getting
prices
in
this
range
russsian
river
comes
to
mind
but
rr
is
worth
it
i
am
not
sure
i
could
say
the
same
for
double
dead
guy
worth
a
try
but
probably
my
only
one
it
feels
a
little
heavy
in
the
mouth
but
not
so
much
on
the
stomach
id
say
this
is
quite
a
drinkable
beer
especially
considering
how
intense
it
really
is
my
friend
gave
it
to
me
on
my
birthday
out
of
her
private
stock
and
overall
i
see
why
she
loves
it
however
it
does
not
fit
perfectly
with
my
personal
preference
for
the
type
of
beer
it
is
it
is
a
tasty
concoction
worth
the
experience
though
it
is
outside
my
bouds
of
preference
overall
as
i
would
gladly
drink
it
if
offered
or
if
it
were
availabe
though
i
would
not
necessarily
go
and
spend
12
bucks
on
a
22
of
it
for
myself
my
dad
would
probably
like
it
though
smooth
medium
in
body
and
lightly
carbonated
rogues
double
dead
guy
ale
is
quite
tasty
and
very
drinkable
pours
a
medium
amberish
orange
with
a
small
tan
head
that
retains
wellleaving
some
nice
even
lacing
on
the
glass
the
nose
is
a
bit
grainy
at
first
whiffwith
some
mildly
sweet
caramel
and
earthy
notes
this
is
more
like
a
double
ipa
than
a
doppelbockthough
it
fits
into
neither
category
this
is
very
hoppy
and
equally
grainy
citrus
and
pine
throughout
with
some
caramel
and
light
banana
flavors
a
magnified
version
of
the
dga
leaning
a
little
more
to
the
hoppy
sideas
apposed
to
the
toasted
banana
bread
side
of
the
original
version
a
bitter
finish
and
sweet
caramelyfruity
aftertaste
keep
things
interesting
double
dead
guy
is
a
great
offeringbut
others
of
equal
character
can
be
had
for
a
much
smaller
price
tag
a
decent
beer
just
too
sugary
for
my
tastes
this
is
a
doppelbock
eh
i
dont
think
so
more
like
a
lighter
american
barleywine
imo
refreshing
and
delicious
hiding
the
alcohol
the
color
is
great
and
the
texture
and
carbonation
is
perfect
for
me
its
a
little
hoppier
than
i
like
and
i
like
some
hoppy
beers
pretty
good
but
maybe
not
worth
it
considering
the
price
11
for
750
ml
worth
a
try
though
if
you
can
find
a
good
deal
d
this
was
a
very
interesting
brew
and
one
im
glad
i
had
i
would
try
it
again
worth
seeking
out
warning
this
stuff
can
really
slow
down
your
home
brew
bottling
session
it
slowed
me
down
big
time
so
be
careful
maybe
i
will
wait
until
after
i
bottle
before
i
drink
this
again
during
a
bottling
session
oh
well
it
made
a
good
story
in
the
process
cheers
in
my
opinion
for
11bottle
this
needs
to
deliver
a
little
bit
more
i
had
this
on
tap
at
taco
macs
in
downtown
atlanta
the
beer
style
wasnt
stated
but
i
claim
it
to
be
a
hopped
doppelbock
not
unlike
smooth
hoperator
the
beer
was
a
little
murky
dark
copper
colored
the
aroma
was
malty
and
bocklike
with
a
citrus
character
added
to
the
mix
the
taste
was
nice
sweet
malty
flavor
with
aggressive
hops
on
top
adding
some
bitter
citrus
sweetness
a
little
ethyl
alcohol
is
apparent
in
the
flavor
keeping
the
drinkability
score
low
for
me
an
interesting
beer
that
im
glad
i
tried
drinkability
probably
dangerously
drinkable
considering
the
alcohol
the
dryness
is
probably
a
bit
higher
than
i
would
like
over
an
extended
drinking
period
and
its
not
really
like
any
other
dopplebock
i
could
name
but
its
a
good
beer
that
deserves
a
look
from
any
fan
of
rogue
because
of
the
hype
surrounding
this
beer
it
seems
that
the
actual
samples
have
not
held
up
to
the
anticipations
however
the
beer
turns
out
better
than
i
expected
the
appearance
is
similar
to
the
regular
dead
guy
but
the
carbonation
seems
appropriate
for
the
viscocity
and
the
color
is
a
bit
darker
but
still
with
the
goldenamber
hazy
hue
light
on
head
formation
but
good
with
retention
aromas
are
moderate
and
take
on
dopplebock
melanoidins
rich
bready
alcoholic
and
fruity
with
raisons
dates
and
figs
quite
undopplebocklike
with
hight
hopping
rates
of
citrus
and
pine
and
estery
fruitiness
of
apples
pears
and
berries
aromas
transer
to
flavors
very
nicely
with
a
good
balance
of
malts
to
hops
that
keep
the
beer
from
the
overly
sweet
character
of
the
original
dead
guy
body
is
rich
but
the
hops
and
a
alcohol
bittering
keeps
the
body
from
cloying
syrupy
or
heavy
this
beer
works
very
well
for
a
dopplebock
even
if
it
is
off
of
style
a
quite
a
bit
i
think
this
is
a
better
beer
than
the
original
not
a
bad
brew
high
abv
is
hidden
under
the
generous
sweetness
overall
seems
light
in
character
certainly
worth
a
try
overall
pretty
solid
enjoyed
it
dthis
one
to
me
is
like
a
dead
guy
with
a
heavy
body
does
not
really
have
many
of
the
classic
dopple
feels
to
it
im
not
sure
i
would
spend
the
money
to
get
it
over
just
the
standard
dead
guy
again
sorry
but
i
cant
get
passed
the
mustiness
in
this
one
together
with
the
fact
that
there
just
isnt
alot
going
on
in
here
wont
be
rushing
out
to
buy
more
of
these
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
mild
carbonation
this
is
way
out
of
balance
and
doesnt
seem
to
fit
the
dopplebock
style
very
well
this
might
mellow
out
and
improve
with
aging
but
im
not
that
interested
in
finding
out
possibly
the
coolest
bomber
ive
ever
seen
been
hunting
this
one
down
all
over
town
but
dont
get
me
started
on
that
now
its
time
to
enjoy
a
clean
amber
colored
brew
with
a
prolific
tan
head
that
reaches
to
the
rim
of
the
pilsner
and
slowly
fades
leaving
a
smattering
of
lacing
all
along
the
way
theres
a
not
a
whole
lot
going
on
aromawise
theres
some
toasted
malts
in
distance
a
bigger
whiff
also
reveals
some
caramel
undertones
tastes
malty
and
a
bit
bready
theres
some
grain
and
grass
thrown
in
as
well
a
good
hit
of
hops
reveals
themselves
after
a
few
drinks
and
really
stirs
things
up
the
alcohol
heat
is
evident
but
not
bothersome
my
first
impression
of
this
brew
wasnt
that
great
but
as
i
spent
some
time
with
it
it
really
grew
on
me
another
topnotch
offering
from
rogue
here
as
all
ready
stated
this
dbl
dead
guy
is
not
really
speaking
the
tongue
and
chewy
cheek
sticking
doppelbock
that
it
should
and
for
the
price
id
rather
get
me
some
celebrator
sorry
this
rogue
beer
didnt
do
much
for
me
other
then
teaste
me
with
its
great
appearance
and
fancy
cool
red
bottle
d
overall
some
noticeable
alcohol
fusels
and
warming
may
limit
consumptions
but
much
like
the
beer
you
will
warm
up
to
this
the
more
you
drink
in
is
just
awesome
get
it
while
you
can
the
bottle
gets
you
really
excited
to
try
this
brew
out
it
pours
a
hazy
yellow
copper
with
a
craggy
medium
sized
head
this
brew
leaves
an
inordinate
amount
of
lacing
as
it
goes
down
smell
is
sharp
ripe
fruits
with
a
sweet
caramel
note
some
bready
sour
yeasts
taste
was
huge
bready
fruit
explosion
just
the
right
amount
of
sweetness
very
nice
some
alcohol
bite
as
well
faint
grassy
hops
mouthfeel
was
initially
full
and
chewy
but
is
quickly
tempered
by
that
alcohol
bite
a
fairly
drinkable
big
beer
though
i
found
a
single
bomber
to
be
the
right
serving
size
for
me
nice
bright
red
bottle
appearance
is
clear
amberred
that
poured
into
my
glass
with
a
finger
width
of
offwhite
foam
good
lacing
not
much
in
the
aroma
department
some
of
the
bready
melanoidens
typical
of
the
style
very
faint
noble
hop
aroma
taste
is
mostly
malt
here
similar
to
the
aroma
with
a
little
bit
of
a
winey
aftertaste
medium
to
mediumfull
mouthfeel
good
carbonation
and
mediumlow
hop
bitterness
makes
this
brew
very
drinkable
for
9
abv
still
im
a
tad
disappointed
since
i
paid
11
99
plus
tax
for
this
bottle
way
overpriced
but
still
a
delicious
beer
as
i
drink
more
of
this
beer
i
do
like
the
use
of
american
citrus
hops
kinda
of
gives
it
a
crisper
and
more
refreshing
taste
still
there
are
better
examples
of
this
style
drinkability
was
soso
its
not
my
style
hot
and
homebrewy
im
gonna
give
my
bottle
at
least
a
year
of
cellaring
before
i
even
think
about
cracking
it
open
d
i
find
myself
a
bit
let
down
on
this
in
terms
of
drinkability
and
balance
of
flavor
i
will
stick
with
the
regular
dead
guy
not
bad
but
not
great
pours
a
fairly
bright
orange
that
is
a
tad
cloudy
with
a
small
unimpressive
mostly
white
head
that
quickly
dissipates
smells
of
citusy
hops
and
fruits
dominate
first
sip
is
creamy
with
tangy
hops
bitterness
a
nice
malt
backbone
compliments
well
the
finish
is
tasty
and
bitter
with
the
9
abv
somewhat
hidden
this
brew
is
slightly
under
carbonated
not
bad
but
but
worth
10750ml
d
great
beer
i
have
been
drinking
dead
guy
for
a
long
time
but
have
never
seen
this
before
i
am
happily
surprised
pours
a
clear
brown
amber
with
a
thick
creme
head
nose
is
not
that
eventful
with
mild
malts
floral
fruity
thing
is
kind
of
there
as
well
flavor
is
malty
bitter
tone
with
a
slight
roasted
edge
a
noticeable
alcohol
edge
feel
is
kind
of
sticky
on
the
liquid
and
the
carbonation
is
low
and
a
bit
biting
overall
this
beer
is
eh
the
bomber
was
a
wonderful
blood
red
in
color
but
the
beer
thankfully
looked
like
a
normal
dopplebock
the
body
was
clear
orange
and
formed
a
two
finger
thick
foamy
head
quite
rapidly
the
smell
was
quite
malty
which
was
a
departure
from
a
typical
rogue
beer
laden
with
hops
the
hops
were
detectable
as
a
floral
and
spicy
smell
but
it
melded
quite
well
with
the
malt
the
taste
was
where
this
beer
really
shined
the
sweet
and
caramelized
malts
were
here
as
they
are
in
any
dopplebock
but
they
were
accompanied
by
a
significant
hop
bitterness
and
a
resulting
spicy
and
dry
finish
while
this
was
a
departure
from
the
spirit
of
the
style
it
was
a
welcome
change
the
beer
did
suffer
a
bit
on
the
palette
from
the
high
hopping
rates
as
this
did
not
glide
down
in
a
soft
manner
and
presented
a
bit
of
an
edgy
mouthfeel
i
liked
it
well
enough
to
get
it
downed
quite
rapidly
drinkability
is
pretty
good
here
beer
needs
some
aging
to
get
rid
of
the
alcohol
burn
otherwise
a
great
doppelbock
that
makes
me
hunger
for
pizza
d
i
was
impressed
by
double
dead
guy
ale
a
smooth
sipper
that
you
need
to
be
cautious
with
i
actually
preferr
regular
dead
guy
to
the
double
wasnt
to
impressed
by
this
better
off
leaving
the
dead
guy
single
a
patchy
head
pale
copper
color
the
bubbles
rise
slowly
as
though
in
a
thickened
gel
4
25
s
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
doesnt
need
to
be
right
under
your
nose
to
get
the
sense
of
it
citrus
and
bubble
gum
are
two
of
the
aromas
that
first
hit
me
4
00
t
this
is
a
hop
bomb
lots
of
bitter
and
piney
hops
some
underlying
sweetness
from
a
heavy
malt
base
which
balances
it
out
nicely
4
25
m
medium
bodied
which
lingers
on
the
tongue
for
a
while
4
25
d
certainly
an
extreme
beer
the
amount
of
hops
alone
pushes
this
beer
into
the
category
i
recently
had
this
on
tap
at
rfd
in
dc
and
was
happy
to
know
that
i
had
a
bottle
waiting
for
me
at
home
i
would
recommend
this
beer
4
25
drinks
okay
for
the
abv
nothing
special
here
overpriced
glad
i
tried
it
not
sure
id
ever
have
another
its
lighter
than
most
doppelbocks
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
solid
head
that
dissolves
down
and
leaves
good
lacing
nose
is
crazy
sweet
molasses
straight
up
beer
is
quite
tasty
cookies
sugar
and
malt
are
huge
and
a
slightly
chalky
aftertaste
body
is
nice
medium
with
perfect
carbonation
overall
a
delicious
and
interesting
beer
i
havent
had
the
regular
dead
guy
in
a
while
so
im
not
really
sure
how
it
compares
but
this
is
a
delicious
and
sweet
treat
md
good
mouthfeel
medium
bodied
carbonation
is
light
decent
drinkability
as
well
the
alcohol
is
there
so
its
a
bit
of
a
sipper
but
it
goes
down
easy
d
a
good
beer
from
rogue
certainly
gets
more
interesting
as
it
warms
up
i
could
drink
it
again
but
im
not
going
to
pay
12
for
a
bottle
if
it
was
a
4
bomber
ok
decent
mouthfeel
not
entirely
unpleasant
alcohol
burn
hampers
my
enjoyment
of
this
somewhat
neat
bottle
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
pours
a
light
brown
color
with
moderate
carbonation
and
lacing
smell
is
sweet
caramel
and
malt
taste
is
more
sweet
caramel
with
hints
of
bread
average
mouthfeel
and
good
drinkability
im
curious
to
see
how
this
one
ages
enjoyed
on
tap
at
the
buckeye
brew
engine
a
good
bitternessbalanced
with
lots
of
caramel
tasty

halts
this

i
prefer
the

as
this
one
is
a
little
too
boozey
for
me
still
i
would
have
no
problem
revisiting
from
timetotime
notes
a
solid
double
version
of
the
dead

ale
not
quite
as
extreme
as
i
was
anticipating
what
with
the
bizarre
packaging
worth
a
try
and
ill
definitely
want
more
of
this
one
felt
a
little
sticky
but
goes
down
well
quite
filling
mouthfeel
is
again
thinner
and
more

i
love

a

and
this
is
right
up
there
the
price
was
a
little
high
at
12
but
it
is
an
enjoyable
beer
they
called
it
double
dead
to
capitalize
on
that
name
but
this
is
a
different
beast
very
nice
all
around
while
often
slept

the

i
can
pick
up

the
taste
adds
caramel

lots

i
found
it
fun
to

it

at
a
time

you
like
dead

youre
going
to
love
this
if
dead

isnt

a

copper
color
with
a

dense

colored

that
settled
into
a

with
plenty
of

the
aroma
is
of
bready
munich
malt
grape
like
hops
and
a
touch
of
booze
similar
to
a
barley
wine
the
taste
is
of

bready
honey
malt
touch
of
peppery
and

some
alcohol
grapes
kind
of
a
boozy

thus
the

name
definitley
some
barley
wine
characteristics
though
the
feel
is
thick
and
slick
soft
carbonation
and
finishes
with
a
nice
hop
bitterness
definitely
a
big
beer
with
some
appealing
characteristics
not
sure
it
is
a
dopplebock
though
i
see
a
lot
of
people
referring
to
this
as
a
maibock
and
doppelbock
its
neither
the
bottle
clearly
indicates
it
is
made
with
top
fermenting
pacman
yeast
so
its
an
ale
not
a
lager
ive
seen
some
people
classify
this
a
strong
american
ale
thats
how
it
was
labeled
when
i
bought
it
at
the
store
to
me
it
tastes
more
like
an
american
barley
wine

stronger
in

than
i
expected
as
the
bitter

linger
around
a
quite

with
that
being
said
theres
still

a

also

good
its

enjoyable
to

overall
i
think
this
is
a
good
brew
id
pick
it
up
again
for
sure
over
the
past
week
i
have
now
had
the
ddga
on
tap
at
taco
mac
and
at
home
out
of
the
750
ml
bottle
overall
i
am
now
thinking
i
preferred
it
on
tap
as
i
poured
the
750
ml
bottle
you
see
a
uhc
lighter
but
very
beautiful
copper
color
solid
but
somewhat
light
head
the
smell
does
not
really
indicate
much
to
be
honest
i
felt
this
was
the
biggest
shortcoming
of
the
beer
the
taste
was
interesting
balance
of
a
lighter
than
usual
dopple
with
a
lot
flavor
the
hops
are
very
strong
in
the
flavor
there
is
a
fairly
present
carbonization
which
adds
to
the
some
what
bitter
aftertaste
a
very
drinkable
beer
but
nothing
groundbreaking
i
wanted
to
echo
another
persons
feeling
of
let
down
i
had
hoped
to
age
a
few
of
these
but
am
wondering
if
it
is
worth
it

another

by

worth
a
try
why
not
release
a
better
beer
such
as
something
out
of
johns
locker
stock
d
this
is
a
huge
and
filling
beer
that
is
easy
to
drink
i
would
save
this
one
for
special
occasions
and
special
meals
halloween
is
coming
up
and
in
a
dream
world
people
would
hand
this
out
instead
of
candy
plus
the
bottle
is
a
keeper

a
very
good

by

hearts
double
dead

poured

hazy
copper
color
with
a
nice
one
finger
offwhite
head
minimal
lacing
but
good
retention
on
the
inside
of
the
glass
the
smell
was
not
as
potent
as
i
thought
from
my
first
experience
however
the
aroma
is
very
complex
with
caramel
malt
breadlike
yeast
piney
hops
and
of
course
the
smell
of
alcohol
the
caramel
malts
hit
you
first
in
the
mouth
then
the
sweetness
fades
out
to
a
strong
hop
finish
with
a
long
hang
time
this
beer
is
fullbodied
and
viscous
with
medium
carbonation
double
dead
guy
is
surprisingly
easy
to
drink
however
the
alcohol
will
catch
up
to
you
very
quickly
highly
recomended
if
you
can
find
it
yes
the
aroma
is
like
a
manhattan
pothole
coming
out
of
nowhere
to
almost
take
off
a
wheel
but
the
rest
of
the
crew
comes
to
the
rescue
and
its
worth
the
patience
it
takes
to
not
disregard
it
the
alcohol
is
a
sneaky
monkey
much
stronger
than
it
presents
but
that
also
helps
it
drink
willingly
if
a
bit
daringly
as
well
so
i
have
no
idea
how
the
smell
comes
up
so
damned
short
but
its
recoverable
and
im
glad
it
was
in
the
end
d
very
drinkable
as
the
whole
bomber
was
easy
to
finish
very
nice
mix
of
all
the
flavors
and
a
beer
i
really
enjoyed
d
good
brew
that
has
a
lot
going
on
the
alcohol
really
can
hit
you
hard
if
this
thing
is
warm
the
flavor
and
aroma
are
very
good
i
would
absolutely
drink
this
again
especially
if
the
bottle
price
drops
a
bit
as
for
now
the
price
negatively
affects
the
drinkability
to
me
d
this
is
a
very
tasty
beer
thats
easy
to
drink
just
watch
out
for
the
abv
overall
you
must
get
this
beer
if
havent
already
seriously
fairly
drinkable
id
have
another
its
on
the
fuller
side
of
mediumbodied
alcohol
is
noticeable
but
not
sharp
drinks
well
despite
that
this
is
a
nice
one
double
dead
guy
is
a
great
beer
and
one
that
i
expected
a
lot
from
happily
i
wasnt
too
let
down
it
was
way
easier
to
drink
than
i
expected
it
to
be
as
my
empty
glass
attests
to
again
it
can
be
a
little
hot
but
not
really
that
much
especially
considering
the
9
abv
recommended
overall
i
was
hoping
for
a
bit
more
but
that
doesnt
mean
it
wasnt
a
good
beer
worth
a
shot
if
for
no
other
reason
than
its
a
limiting
offering
from
the
boys
at
rogue
i
like
this
stuff
better
than
the
regular
dead
guy
now
even
with
the
extra
octane
they
managed
to
keep
things
in
control
and
give
it
all
an
extra
boost
of
goodness
ill
have
to
save
my
paper
route
money
for
another
16
can
bottle
of
this
stuff
very
good
beer
thanks
rogue
for
finally
bottling
this
ive
had
it
on
tap
but
for
6
in
an
8
ounce
glass
this
is
by
far
a
better
value
at
11
for
22
ounces
poured
a
22oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
in
three
servings
cool
bottle
by
the
way
pours
a
copper
color
with
huge
thick
head
and
a
lot
of
lacing
i
had
to
let
it
settle
for
a
few
minutes
before
drinking
smeels
mildly
malty
with
sweetness
and
citrus
mixed
it
the
hops
are
noticable
but
the
9
abv
is
not
moderate
to
heavy
body
with
mild
carbonation
tastes
malty
and
sweet
but
not
overly
malty
tastes
somewhat
smokey
to
me
it
goes
down
smooth
and
is
a
very
drinkable
doppelbock
i
enjoyed
this
drinkability
that
wasnt
half
bad
rather
drinkable
considering
the
9
5
abv
i
must
say
though
im
definitely
glad
i
found
it
reasonably
priced
on
draft
as
opposed
to
plunking
down
the
dough
for
the
bottle
i
dont
want
to
be
a
double
broke
guy
an
interesting
sample
from
rogue
in
my
opinion
certainly
not
worth
the
price
more
than
anything
youre
paying
the
extra
dollar
for
the
cool
bottle
its
hard
to
say
much
about
this
one
except
maybe
that
its
a
slightly
stronger
dead
guy
ale
its
certainly
not
a
doppelbock
in
the
traditional
sence
as
its
less
malty
and
sweet
plus
its
brewed
with
an
ale
yeast
pacman
like
deadguy
is
maybe
its
lagered
i
dont
know
its
hard
to
call
an
ale
a
lager
when
its
crossing
one
of
the
more
fundamentel
boundaries
of
beer
top
vs
bottom
fermented
either
way
its
decent
but
not
the
most
enjoyable
beer
ive
ever
had
this
ones
open
for
interpretation
d
nice
beginning
middle
and
finish
i
recommend
picking
up
a
22oz
throwing
it
in
your
freezer
for
2030
min
if
bought
at
room
temperature
like
i
did
drink
the
first
part
of
the
bomber
at
freezer
temp
and
then
allow
it
to
warm
it
truly
gives
the
full
spectrum
of
the
beers
potential
fyi
i
do
the
same
with
ommegangs
three
philosophers
and
unibroue
cheque
chose
not
sure
if
i
got
the
spelling
right
its
unibroues
low
carbonation
cherry
beer
im
too
lazy
to
check
the
spelling
poured
a
clear
reddish
color
with
a
small
head
that
dissipated
quickly
i
expected
more
carbonation
from
this
beer
aroma
was
hoppy
but
with
a
good
bit
of
sweet
honeyish
malt
aromas
mixed
in
taste
was
quite
sweet
up
front
with
some
notes
of
honey
and
caramel
the
finish
had
a
sharp
alcohol
bite
i
think
this
one
needs
6
months
or
more
of
aging
to
round
out
as
it
was
overly
sweet
and
cloying
drinkability
was
slightly
above
average
i
plan
on
picking
up
another
couple
of
bottles
to
lay
down
this
was
a
great
session
beer
that
i
would
love
to
enjoy
again
overall
a
pretty
tasty
brew
recommended
d
just
shy
of
refreshing
but
certainly
drinkable
ive
enjoyed
better
offerings
from
rogue
and
for
me
the
9
abv
detracts
from
an
otherwise
nicely
crafted
ale
t
the
most
important
part
not
bad
if
this
is
truly
a
dopplebock
its
underwhelming
there
is
a
skosh
of
caramel
and
malt
taste
but
its
light
and
mellow
this
is
an
easy
drinking
bock
beer
that
has
the
9
sneak
up
on
you
bocks
lead
maltfirst
all
the
way
while
this
is
leaning
on
the
hops
side
bocks
can
get
sickly
sweet
and
sticky
while
ddg
gets
abrasively
bitter
as
it
warms
the
style
issue
has
been
beat
pretty
hard
here
so
ill
just
say
that
i
enjoy
this
highgravity
ale
and
while
its
not
the
best
effort
rogues
put
out
its
certainly
an
enjoyable
nights
drink
pours
a
clear
amber
color
with
a
big
frothy
offwhite
head
that
settles
fairly
slowly
aroma
is
somewhat
dried
fruit
and
sweet
chock
full
of
malty
goodness
flavor
has
a
nice
initially
subdued
hop
presence
that
become
more
and
more
apparent
the
heavy
malt
load
helps
create
enough
sweetness
to
mask
the
high
9
abv
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
surprisingly
less
sticky
than
i
wouldve
expected
tasty
brew
from
rogue
surprised
how
undeadguy
the
taste
appears
to
be
but
id
have
to
do
a
side
by
side
tasting
to
be
certain
worth
drinking
once
but
not
that
much
better
than
regular
dead
guy
imo
never
would
have
pegged
this
as
a
doppelbock
actually
more
of
a
slightly
mild
dipa
ill
sure
buy
more
d
i
dont
think
i
meant
to
drink
750ml
but
the
bottle
which
is
sprayed
red
is
deceiving
for
its
size
appearing
more
like
22oz
which
is
somehow
mentally
more
justifiable
than
drinking
all
750ml
either
way
i
found
it
very
easy
to
sip
on
satisfying
without
being
at
all
too
heavy
very
nicely
flavored
not
getting
old
at
all
but
leaving
the
kind
of
lingering
taste
that
causes
you
to
keep
putting
the
glass
to
the
lips
for
more
at
9
abv
the
alcohol
is
respectfully
well
balanced
into
the
overall
character
of
the
beer
and
has
little
negative
impact
beyond
physical
effect
on
the
body
i
felt
the
nose
and
taste
were
very
complex
and
the
beer
grew
on
me
as
i
drank
it
i
still
would
not
rate
this
as
a
doppelbock
this
is
more
of
an
american
ale
or
brown
ale
hard
to
catagorize
this
one
a
good
beer
in
an
interesting
package
there
are
several
in
their
new
lineup
but
some
others
are
rather
pricy
taste
is
watery
at
first
then
thickens
up
as
it
warms
grapefruit
hops
malt
few
sweet
fruits
touch
of
caramel
ends
with
a
very
bitter
aftertaste
and
slightly
dry
id
like
to
try
this
again
in
bottle
to
see
how
it
compares
the
beer
is
poured
a
copper
a
colour
with
a
nice
two
finger
head
really
good
retention
and
lacing
the
nose
on
the
beer
is
malty
with
a
bit
of
spicy
hops
the
beer
has
a
nice
bitter
hoppiness
with
a
nice
caramel
maltiness
this
is
not
a
dopplebock
its
probably
closer
to
an
strong
american
ale
or
something
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
thick
and
this
beer
is
really
drinkable

this
is
an
interesting
brew
it
is
surprisingly
hoppy
in
the
flavor
and
hides
its
alcohol
fairly
well
though
it
can
get
hot
at
times
with
the
peppery
alcohol
notes
in
the
finish
d
scary
close
to
dead
guy
ale
though
subtle
differences
can
be
noted
mostly
in
the
malt
department
rare
brew
so
do
try
though
i
wouldnt
pay
a
rare
price
if
you
have
too
that
is

a
big
mouthfeel
with
a
semidry
hop
and
hints
of
alcohol
in
the
aftertaste
big
hops
big
alcohol
and
a
bit
abbrasive
yet
quite
good
the
flavor
is
a
lot
like
regular
dead
guy
just
well
doubled
double
the
hops
double
the
malts
double
the
sweetness
and
double
my
enjoyment
the
hops
are
the
highlight
here
and
while
the
resinous
pine
notes
dont
necessarily
fit
within
the
dopplebock
style
i
definately
enjoyed
it
body
is
creamy
smooth
mediumbodied
neatly
carbonated
and
provides
a
lasting
hoppy
bite
id
definately
look
for
this
beer
again
and
i
hope
to
god
that
rogue
decides
to
bottle
it
deep
ambercopper
color
with
an
offwhite
foamy
fully
diminishing
head
the
smell
is
predominantly
of
citrusy
and
floral
hops
with
a
little
caramel
malt
in
there
not
as
big
i
was
expecting
from
double
dead
guy
the
taste
is
quite
a
bit
bigger
with
a
big
initial
hit
of
citrusy
and
piney
hops
grapefruit
for
sure
then
the
outmatched
malts
show
up
for
a
little
while
before
being
shoved
out
of
the
way
by
the
bitterness
and
warm
alcohol
on
the
finish
it
has
a
mediumfull
body
light
creamy
texture
and
moderate
carbonation
i
dont
know
something
about
this
beer
just
didnt
impress
me
at
all
it
was
good
but
i
still
consider
it
a
bit
of
a
letdown
and
i
definitely
have
to
knock
some
points
off
for
it
not
being
a
good
example
of
a
doppelbock

notes
not
really
sure
how
to
describe
this
stylewise
which
makes
sense
given
that
regular
dead
guy
is
a
bastardized
style
anyhow
a
maibock
is
a
lager
yet
they
use
an
ale
yeast
at
times
i
thought
this
reminded
me
more
of
a
strong
ale
while
at
other
times
i
was
actually
thinking
american
barleywine
bordering
on
dipa
id
get
it
again
though
whatever
you
want
to
call
it
d
if
i
think
of
this
as
a
dark
ipa
im
ok
with
it
but
id
much
prefer
the
original
dead
guy
ale
over
this
one
dead
guy
is
a
wonderfully
balanced
beer
this
isnt
the
beer
poured
a
clear
dark
amber
with
a
thin
dense
tan
head
into
a
chalice
aroma
was
of
piney
hops
the
beer
was
very
well
balanced
with
a
big
hop
flavor
coalescing
with
a
honeymalt
sweetness
and
with
a
solid
bitter
hop
finish
a
much
better
effort
than
the
skull
splitter
which
i
had
the
same
day
a
great
upgrade
to
the
standard
dead
guy
ale
d
good
and
drinkable
but
i
think
i
prefer
the
regular
dead
guy
to
the
double
nice
beer
and
will
have
again
if
its
not
gone
before
i
go
back
d
im
not
sure
id
want
another
on

at

in
buffalopoured
into
a
standard

a

lighter

a

i
did
today

honey
notes
mixed
with
some
toasty

finishing
with
that
rogue
trade
mark
of
citricpiney
hop
bitterness
a
nice
newer
version
of
the
old
dg
classic
nice
flavors
overall
i
thought
this
was
excellent
and
much
smoother
then
i
ever
thought
it
would
be
a
better
version
of
dead
guy
would
be
the
best
way
to
descrivbe
it
go
out
and
get
this
one
while
you
can
d
hoppy
and
full
bodied
bold
brew
i
could
easily
finish
two
to
three
pints
without
blinking
and
would
be
very
satisfied
clear
medium
copperamber
body
with
a
creamy
offwhite

fresh
pine
hops
and
caramel
malt
are
the
pillars
here
with
rummy
alcohol
and
fruits
mixing
in
taste
starts
with
very
piny

bitterness
balancing
caramel
and
fruit
malt
sweetness
comes
to
the
rescue
warming
rummy

goodness
take

hints
of
vanilla
in
there
herbal
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
fullbodied
with
a
creamy
feel
a
very
drinkable
stronger
version
of
dead
guy
that
really
shines
as
it
warms
up
very
nice
dfor
a
brew
this
big
this
is
smooth
stuff
i
am
sure
the
high
abv
it
must
be
10
would
keep
you
from
downing
too
many
certainly
not
a
dopplebock
but
regardless
an
interesting
experiment
by
rogue
overall
a
little
harsh
around
the
edges
give
it
a
try
i
liked
this
it
truelly
is
a
double
dead
guy
ale
maintaining
the
sweet
flavors
and
hoppiness
of
the
original
while
successfully
adding
a
bigger
and
badder
feel
with
the
jacked
up
abv
actually
even
with
the
higher
alcohol
element
i
still
found
this
to
be
a
highly
drinkable
affair
and
one
that
i
would
return
to
served
a
crisp
dark
orange
with
a
decent
head
that
diminished
and
left
spotty
lacing
the
aroma
was
loads
of
caramel
and
some
roasted
malts
the
taste
was
a
wonderful
complex
blend
of
caramel
dried
fruits
brown
malts
and
some
sweet
fruits
the
beer
is
slightly
heavy
with
some
sticky
alcohol
this
one
is
a
great
sipper
but
still
very
refreshing
d
this
brew
benefits
from
resting
after
the
pour
then
look
out
its
a
mouthful
of
joy
i
question
classing
this
as
a
doppelbock
but
whatever
it
is
called
its
a
winner
thanks
brian
just
not
thrilled
with
this
one
and
probably
wont
order
it
again
i
usually
really
enjoy
a
big
beer
but
as
good
as
this
was
i
dont
think
it
was
an
improvement
over
the
standard
dead
guy
from
a
freshly
tapped
keg
it
poured
a
fairly
clear
dark
orangeish
amber
with
an
off
white
head
that
held
well
and
left
sheets
of
lace
on
the
glass
normally
im
not
a
fan
of
dead
guy
from
the
bottle
but
on
tap
its
been
excellent
so
i
had
to
give
this
one
a
shot
its
pretty
much
what
i
expected
an
amped
up
dead
guy
with
a
lot
more
hops
very
piney
almost
overrode
the
nice
caramelly
and
fruity
malt
character
i
wished
it
was
a
bit
creamier
and
thought
it
would
be
hard
to
have
a
few
but
enjoyed
it
nonetheless
cheers
bottled
november
2009
5
years
old
wonderfully
integrated
flavors
so
smooth
this
was
the
second
batch
2
o
if
you
are
still
sitting
on
bottles
of
this
i
would
crack
them
open
and
see
if
its
come
to
a
place
where
you
like
it
i
dont
think
this
has
done
very
well
with
age
on
it
this
beer
is
veer
deep
mahogany
color
with
light
caramel
head
that
dissipates
leaving
a
thin
coating
of
bubbles
around
the
glass
the
aroma
is
dark
dried
fruits
and
tobacco
the
flavor
follows
suit
with
a
sweet
caramel
and
raisin
start
it
finishes
with
a
slightly
bitter
taste
with
a
hint
of
roasted
smokiness
it
is
a
good
balance
of
sweet
and
bitter
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
right
it
is
just
thick
and
syrupy
enough
but
has
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
to
keep
it
light
and
drinkable
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
i
wish
that
i
had
a
few
more
bottles
of
this
one
it
could
definitely
last
a
bit
longer
o
this
beer
has
aged
wonderfully
i
love
the
thick
mouthfeel
although
i
can
taste
the
alcohol
it
still
drinks
remarkably
well
i
am
definitely
glad
i
aged
a
bottle
o
although
i
did
not
review
this
fresh
as
i
remember
life
limb
v2
being
cloyingly
sweet
the
2
years
of
age
has
done
this
beer
remarkably
well
american
strong
ale
is
a
good
category
for
it
as
it
is
quite
complex
and
possesses
qualities
of
an
imperial
stout
belgian
quadruple
and
the
earthiness
of
something
that
might
construed
as
being
barrelaged
i
would
not
purchase
a
case
but
being
a
fan
of
both
of
these
breweries
this
stands
to
be
one
of
the
most
enjoyable
collaboration
and
aged
beers
i
have
sampled
well
done
4
25
o
this
beer
has
aged
gracefully
in
a
good
way
glad
i
sat
on
it
overall
its
got
a
lot
of
the
syrup
flavors
but
that
doesnt
make
it
terribly
exciting
i
had
this
beer
at
a
tasting
a
couple
years
ago
and
was
really
impressed
by
it
i
bought
a
bottle
stashed
it
in
the
cellar
and
forgot
about
it
until
today
im
glad
i
waited
as
i
think
i
have
developed
more
of
an
appreciation
for
clean
malty
flavors
since
then
this
is
a
delightful
beer
and
i
hope
dfh
will
brew
it
again
someday
so
others
can
try
it
o
really
drinks
more
like
a
stout
than
a
barleywine
which
i
guess
is
why
they
use
the
useless
term
american
strong
ale
to
describe
it
definitely
worth
a
try
awesome
collab
here
wouldnt
expect
anything
less
from
these
titans
of
brewing
excellence
it
wasnt
as
good
as
i
hoped
but
it
was
still
delicious
and
very
unique
the
maple
syrup
is
definitely
noticeable
and
became
more
prevalent
as
the
beer
warmed
the
mouthfeel
was
thick
and
creamy
and
the
more
i
drank
the
more
i
started
to
like
this
beer
two
finger
tan
head
with
excellent
lacing
and
retention
on
an
dark
deep
amber
body
aroma
is
excellent
with
dark
chocolate
brown
sugar
toasted
malts
earthy
hops
and
semisweet
dark
fruit
i
was
a
little
timid
trying
this
one
expecting
it
to
be
very
boozy
but
it
wasnt
at
all
flavors
more
on
the
dark
fruit
and
sour
fruit
side
up
front
with
bitter
citrus
into
the
finish
on
a
base
of
chocolate
and
caramel
toasted
malts
in
the
background
full
body
and
light
to
moderate
carbonation
nicely
smooth
for
the
style
very
nice
beer
deceptively
boozy
good
to
share
huge
licorice
notes
with
lighter
berrylike
fruits
strawberries
and
maybe
even
cranberries
a
lot
going
on
here
and
is
still
a
bit
hot
could
probably
benefit
from
another
year
or
two
still
a
decent
hop
bite
medium
sweetness
molasses
perhaps
and
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
rich
interesting
brew
although
i
am
getting
a
bit
too
much
on
the
licoricealcohol
combo
they
seem
to
accentuate
each
other
the
beer
has
definitely
gotten
a
bit
on
the
overcarbonated
beer
at
least
from
what
was
intended
but
it
is
not
excessively
so
and
this
has
likely
dried
out
the
beer
a
bit
more
than
it
otherwise
would
have
been
i
am
a
bit
surprised
that
i
have
had
this
beer
since
2009
it
is
certainly
holding
up
well
even
if
a
touch
of
oxidation
is
becoming
noticeable
this
was
not
my
beer
made
by
two
of
my
favorite
breweries
dfh
and
sierra
nevada
this
didnt
really
come
through
for
me
the
color
surprised
me
first
of
all
and
was
not
a
bad
thing
but
was
much
darker
than
i
was
expecting
dark
with
bronze
highlights
when
held
to
light
and
moderate
wet
head
smell
has
lots
of
maple
brown
sugar
and
some
malt
but
is
muddy
and
indistinct
taste
is
the
same
lots
of
the
same
flavors
but
nothing
really
stands
out
and
it
becomes
just
a
sweet
blur
feel
is
smooth
a
little
sticky
definitely
not
my
favorite
from
these
two
and
there
are
many
other
better
american
strong
ale
choices
like
brown
shugga
and
deliverance
overall
a
very
good
sweet
beer
with
a
little
barrel
flavor
that
is
highly
drinkable
i
did
not
even
notice
the
beer
was
10
2
from
drinking
it
life
and
limb
the
sndfh
collab
nice
i
think
time
has
been
kind
to
this
one
better

i

really
enjoyed
this
one
overall
a
really
nice
offering
way
different
than
the
ipa
they
came
out
with
this
year
but
still
really
nice
o
lots
of
alcoholic
effect
dig
the
malty
sugar
flavors
but
it
wears
after
awhile
the
maple
and
birch
add
some
interesting
effect
nice
overall
huge
and
somewhat
complex
but
not
fully
capitalized
was
far
too
hyped
at
the
time
there
are
pieces
of
this
beer
that
i
like
but
theres
more
that
i
dont
like
the
taste
is
lacking
and
that
really
defines
the
whole
beer
the
smell
promised
sweetness
and
depth
but
the
taste
didnt
deliver
after
a
glass
im
finding
the
strength
surprising
ill
give
it
that
the
alcohol
is
quite
well
hidden
o
time
has
done
this
beer
right
the
hops
have
mellowed
out
allowing
the
two
syrups
to
really
come
forward
and
shine
i
particularly
enjoyed
the
birch
syrup
and
the
cream
soda
impression
that
it
imparts
the
body
has
smoothed
out
and
developed
a
nice
creamy
and
luscious
texture
a
decadent
afterdinner
beer
that
can
be
paired
with
an
array
of
desserts
maybe
a
pecan
tart
or
simply
a
scoop
of
vanilla
ice
cream
i
wish
one
of
these
breweries
would
revisit
this
one
im
really
not
sure
if
its
this
cellered
brew
or
my
tongue
thats
evolved
so
much
over
the
last
15
months
perhaps
its
both
at
any
rate
this
is
a
pretty
amazing
well
balanced
american
strong
ale
very
easy
on
the
eyes
the
nose
and
the
pallate
i
am
loving
this
on
this
28
morning
following
a
founders
breakfast
stout
i
bought
a
case
of
this
4
months
after
getting
into
real
craft
beer
and
had
alot
of
trepidation
after
trying
it
in
october
2011
but
after
15
months
of
47
cellering
i
fumble
stucked
into
what
i
believe
is
a
great
cellered
american
strong
ale
cheers
and
dont
hate
me
cause
im
a
redneck
overall
a
unique
quirky
and
strong
ale
perhaps
not
up
to
the
par
of
sierra
or
dogfishs
finest
individual
works
but
certainly
a
tasty
and
worthwhile
experiment
overall
a
very
heady
strong
delightful
beer
taste
buds
be
warned
this
is
not
a
beer
for
the
weak
or
faint
of
heart
a
wonderful
american
strong
ale
gave
it
a
4
25
overall
even
though
most
of
the
components
are
4s
just
something
about
this
that
i
really
like
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
nicely
carbonated
it
has
likely
mellowed
in
the
cellar
and
it
is
now
a
balanced
enjoyable
beer
would
i
buy
it
again
yes
d
very
drinkable
great
complexity
with
a
great
balance
the
maple
syrup
is
a
really
nice
touch
overall
i
am
very
impressed
with
how
this
ages
not
sure
what
it
tastes
like
fresh
since
they
were
all
gobbled
up
upon
release
but
this
is
a
very
well
done
beer
the
use
of
molasses
brings
a
nice
element
to
this
style
and
in
my
eyes
this
collaboration
worked
well
the
alcohol
presence
is
still
strong
3
years
later
which
was
a
nice
surprise
considering
the
aging
process
i
could
see
maybe
aging
this
a
few
months
more
but
the
one
i
consumed
was
perfect
for
my
palate
overall
this
old
ale
tastes
more
like
a
huge
barleywine
even
with
its
enormous
taste
profile
it
is
strangely
drinkable
i
do
not
really
feel
sierra
nevadas
presence
in
this
beer
but
dogfishs
propensity
to
brew
with
maple
syrup
thanks
to
the
calagione
family
and
their
willingness
to
branch
out
ha
pun
not
intended
is
felt
throughout
the
beer
this
is
a
very
impressive
offering
and
i
would
love
to
have
this
available
all
the
time
it
is
truly
a
shame
that
this
is
a
onetime
thing

o
i
had
this
one
sitting
in
my
cellar
for
some
time
im
glad
i
let
it
mellow
a
bit
nice
collaboration
between
sn
and
dfh
definitely
one
worth
trying
other
notes
cellared
under
less
than
optimal
conditions
probably
65
degrees
for
a
majority
of
the
year
from
20102011
verdict
i
was
a
fan
of
batch
1
and
thought
batch
2
was
a
bit
of
a
let
down
when
fresh
however
after
a
year
this
is
really
getting
better
the
alcohol
is
still
a
bit
too
much
but
i
think
that
this
one
is
only
getting
better
cant
wait
to
try
it
next
year
o
feels
almost
like
dark
and
rich
bourbon
cocktail
in
beer
form
really
good
cold
weather
beer
an
excellent
collaboration
american
strong
ale
styles
seem
to
be
the
new
hit
with
a
wide
range
of
approaches
enjoyed
this
very
much
the
mouthfeel
is
leaning
towards
the
heavier
side
with
carbonation
being
a
little
above
average
overall
i
thought
it
was
a
lot
better
than
i
was
expecting
it
to
be
it
really
came
together
well
and
the
maple
syrup
was
really
well
represented
in
it
with
all
the
sweet
flavors
i
was
really
impressed
at
how
relatively
balanced
and
drinkable
it
was
very
enjoyable
overall
glad
i
aged
this
one
a
bit
its
better
than
the
bottle
i
drank
a
year
ago
goes
down
a
treat
top
stuff
in
saying
that
this
is
the
type
of
beer
that
almost
needs
a
275ml
bottle
not
a
bomber
o
altogether
a
pleasant
brew
i
respect
the
complexity
this
beer
presents
even
though
im
a
hophead
i
would
still
suggests
this
over
quite
a
few
ipas
if
you
appreciate
complexity
and
uniqueness
youll
enjoy
this
one
one
of
the
more
complex
american
strong
ales
ive
had
a
master
blend
of
balancing
flavors
its
sweet
without
being
cloying
excellent
use
of
ingredients
really
no
flaws
an
awesome
sipper
wish
i
had
another
one
to
age
d
liked
this
quite
a
bit
more
than
i
expected
the
syrup
as
usual
is
a
bit
weak
but
helps
the
feel
one
of
the
better
collabs
ive
had
in
a
while
o
a
very
nice
beer
incredibly
complex
but
still
very
drinkable
wow
i
hope
they
brew
this
again
soon
o
pretty
solid
beer
i
meant
to
drink
one
of
these
fresh
but
it
took
awhile
to
get
around
to
it
nice
complexity
but
imo
the
original
batch
tasted
a
little
better
on
tap
and
aged
o
strong
in
fragrance
and
flavor
smooth
and
well
balanced
definitely
worth
a
try
should
have
some
age
on
it
though
originally
reviewed
08082011
overall
super
solid
but
definitely
a
sipper
with
an
abv
approaching
11
wish
this
one
came
in
the
12
oz
format
o
overall
this
was
forgettable
an
average
american
strong
ale
that
i
would
say
could
age
well
i
gotta
say
unexpected
more
from
these
two
breweries
o
this
is
a
rich
delicious
malty
brew
so
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
and
i
hope
to
continue
this
beer
o
nicely
done
collaboration
beer
great
flavors
and
a
long
lasting
finish
o
drinkability
is
very
smooth
and
polished
for
a
beer
of
this
abv
sweet
dark
fruit
with
an
inviting
and
complimenting
alcohol
that
never
gets
in
the
way
or
distracts
even
upon
warming
drinkability
its
a
very
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
with
great
flavors
and
aromas
not
overly
complex
but
still
very
nice
if
you
have
a
beer
cellar
this
would
be
a
great
addition
to
it
o
high
marks
for
being
delicious
the
added
syrups
are
obvious
but
contribute
to
the
overall
excellence
recommended
sort
of
like
a
barleywine
o
im
glad
i
tried
it
as
i
really
like
both
breweries
but
i
wasnt
amazed
a
decent
american
strong
ale
but
not
as
good
as
arogant
bastard
i
guess
strong
ales
just
arent
my
jam
nonetheless
a
pretty
solid
brew
the
whole
collaboration
thing
is
pretty
cool
mouthfeel
thick
full
bodied
a
little
syrupy
and
chewy
medium
carbonation
but
it
drinks
pretty
easy
the
abv
is
pretty
well
hidden
under
all
the
complex
flavors
this
has
to
offer
long
lasting
finish
pretty
excellent
collaboration
between
sn
dfh
overall
very
drinkable
considering
the
abv
but
not
very
exciting
the
tastes
are
almost
too
well
balanced
leaving
the
beer
fairly
boring
i
was
hoping
for
the
maple
to
stand
out
a
little
bit
more
with
this
one
overall
i
liked
this
beer
and
i
thought
it
was
a
good
example
of
an
american
strong
ale
i
tend
to
think
of
this
style
as
stronger
beers
with
unique
aspects
too
them
that
dont
make
it
fit
in
other
more
straightforward
styles
and
thats
exactly
what
this
beer
is
all
about
and
i
like
that
it
had
good
drinkability
it
went
down
fairly
smooth
but
as
it
warmed
it
got
to
be
a
little
boozy
splitting
a
big
bottle
of
this
with
another
person
is
the
ideal
amount
to
me
a
whole
bottle
to
myself
might
be
a
little
too
much
what
i
liked
most
about
this
beer
was
the
appearance
and
the
complexity
of
the
aroma
and
taste
they
were
both
pretty
nice
what
i
liked
least
about
this
beer
was
how
boozy
it
got
when
it
warmed
up
it
wasnt
overwhelming
or
too
warming
but
i
thought
that
it
could
be
toned
down
a
little
i
might
be
inclined
to
but
this
beer
again
but
it
would
for
sure
be
for
a
special
occasion
since
its
a
little
pricey
but
i
dont
think
i
will
see
it
around
anytime
soon
i
recommend
giving
this
a
try
if
you
can
handle
a
little
booze
you
will
be
rewarded
with
some
rich
and
complex
flavors
and
aromas
i
was
pretty
satisfied
with
this
beer
i
was
looking
for
a
strong
and
complex
beer
that
i
could
sip
on
with
my
brother
and
that
is
exactly
what
this
beer
delivered
i
think
this
beer
could
even
be
aged
for
a
couple
years
it
might
calm
down
the
booze
and
bring
out
some
more
malty
and
sweet
flavors
i
am
big
fan
of
collaboration
beers
and
i
am
glad
these
two
brewerys
came
together
to
make
one
kick
ass
beer
its
one
trend
that
i
would
love
to
see
more
of
and
i
cant
see
why
it
would
be
a
bad
thing
these
two
brewerys
did
a
great
job
with
this
beer
and
i
am
glad
i
got
the
chance
to
try
it
since
this
was
the
last
bottle
left
you
can
be
sure
that
if
you
guys
get
together
for
another
beer
i
will
be
there
waiting
to
get
my
hands
on
a
bottle
good
job
all
around
surprisingly
good
been
sitting
in
my
fridge
for
quite
awhile
frankly
because
i
thought
i
wouldnt
like
it
boy
was
i
wrong
not
much
aroma
but
flavor
and
mouthfeel
are
both
magnificent
it
carries
a
fairly
persistent
head
a
nice
delicate
sweetness
a
very
pleasant
mouthfeel
and
only
a
mild
hop
bitterness
i
believe
this
is
the
second
beer
ive
had
containing
birch
syrup
and
i
liked
the
other
one
just
as
much
time
to
find
more
birch
syrup
beer
i
want
to
rate
this
one
higher
but
its
really
nothing
special
too
many
great
options
in
the
craft
world
for
this
to
stand
out
i
have
another
one
to
sit
on
but
i
doubt
it
will
go
anywhere
but
south
3
5
better
with
a
year
on
the
bottle
life
and
limb
is
a
very
good
beer
i
recommend
trying
at
least
one
bottle
if
you
want
maybe
ill
even
trade
one
to
you
overall
flavours
didnt
really
work
for
me
i
could
see
others
enjoying
this
just
not
me
m
the
maple
is
a
great
addition
bringing
sappy
sweetness
beyond
that
the
dark
base
is
chewy
and
strong
up
to
the
task
im
regretting
only
grabbing
one
bottle
i
have
to
confess
i
didnt
like
this
one
very
much
just
not
very
tasty
the
bottle
was
finished
between
two
people
but
just
barely
a
miss
in
my
mind
i
wanted
something
a
lot
sweeter
with
more
maple
presence
and
less
solvent
booziness
the
appearance
and
aroma
were
somewhat
better
on
the
fresh
bottle
but
the
2009
had
developed
a
very
nice
body
with
great
mouth
feel
this
is
an
excellent
sipping
beer
to
accommodate
drinking
or
deep
conversation
it
also
works
well
with
robust
food
overall
this
beer
is
good
i
just
wish
it
tasted
s
good
as
it
smells
bottle
poured
a
deep
burgundy
color
ale
with
a
super
large
brown
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
good
lacing
aroma
of
caramelized
sugar
and
light
toffee
notes
with
some
dry
fruit
ester
taste
is
a
mix
between
some
caramelized
sugar
notes
with
some
dry
fruit
body
is
quite
full
with
great
carbonation
and
no
apparent
alcohol
not
the
most
complex
brew
thought
this
is
not
a
criticism
as
this
one
is
just
an
easy
drinking
high
abv
beer
good
but
not
great
however
this
is
a
noble
effort
from
two
of
the
best
breweries
we
have
in
this
country
overall
i
loved
this
one
it
was
worth
the
wait
i
was
i
had
a
bottle
to
drink
before
aging
overall
i
would
liken
this
to
a
drinkable
version
of
an
angels
share
overall
this
is
still
a
really
satisfying
beer
but
i
think
i
fully
prefer
this
fresh
the
dark
fruit
flavors
tend
to
hide
the
true
essence
of
the
beer
rather
than
compliment
or
enhance
it
in
my
opinion
taste
is
sweet
to
start
citrus
and
dark
fruit
in
the
middle
and
hops
come
on
with
pine
to
a
warming
close
mouthfeel
is
amazingly
smooth
and
drinkability
is
scary
easy
for
the
abv
sn
dfh
have
created
a
beautiful
symphony
here
atmosphere
is
pretty
solid
decent
head
and
a
full
nose
flavor
is
a
wellbalanced
mix
of
grains
with
subtle
sweet
and
pungent
notes
overall
this
is
a
good
quaff
o
this
was
an
unusual
beer
not
what
i
expected
although
certainly
not
disappointed
definitely
worth
a
try
i
bought
this
and
didnt
wind
up
trying
it
until
months
later
hopefully
there
are
some
bottles
left
o
a
very
nice
beer
if
you
are
in
the
mood
for
something
that
is
a
tad
on
the
sweet
side
it
also
does
a
great
job
concealing
its
10
2
abv
o
a
very
powerful
beer
with
flavors
that
dont
really
pop
neutral
easy
to
drink
flavors
meld
well
is
it
worth
the
price
thats
up
to
each
person
and
how
much
they
enjoy
this
respective
style
and
breweries
o
good
beer
might
be
hard
to
get
through
the
bottle
all
by
myself
for
my
1000th
review
i
thought
i
review
something
special
as
i
dont
see
this
brew
very
often
and
probably
would
not
of
if
it
wasnt
for
mrkennedy
so
big
thanks
for
that
and
it
pours
a
very
dark
kola
hue
which
leaves
a
frothy
creamy
three
finger
head
and
heaps
of
nice
lacingthe
smell
is
burnt

syrupcoffee
and
the
aroma
of
old
trees
in

mouthfeel
is
thick
sticky
and
sweet

has
tastes
of

and
finished
with
a
smooth

and
overall
a
very
lovely
drop
that
would
age
very
well
and
would
revisit
if
i
evrr
saw
again
cheers
overall
i
enjoyed
this
one
a
great
deal
but
based
on
my
memory
of
the
cask
version
this
didnt
quite
live
up
to
my
first
experience
with
this
beer
still
i
really
liked
it
a
lot
and
i
would
definitely
buy
and
drink
again
as
it
was
a
tasty
sort
of
alternative
high
abv
brown
ale
nice
collaboration
i
hope
dfh
and
sn
decide
to
work
together
some
more
ive
had
this
a
few
times
once
at
the
dfh
brewpub
last
night
i
split
one
with
my
wife
we
both
loved
it
pours
into
our
tulip
glasses
very
dark
with
giant
foamy
heads
in
both
of
our
glasses
smells
sweet
to
the
nose
the
taste
follows
suit
with
slight
hints
of
maple
syrup
this
is
a
delicious
dessert
beer
very
creamy
and
thick
i
would
buy
more
of
these
if
they
were
cheaper
and
more
easily
available
a
decent
somewhat
unique
beer
that
seems
to
prove
that
the
strong
ale
style
is
not
one
of
my
favorites
second
note
needed
to
list
this
as
a
nitrobottle
review
in
order
to
review
this
beer
for
life
and
limb
2
this
was
a
standard
corked
1
pint
94
fluid
oz
bottle
of
beer
that
was
not
a
nitro
bottle
just
reviewed
this
way
to
share
the
notes
on
the
2
version
overall
not
a
bad
beer
have
cellared
this
one
for
several
months
but
couldnt
wait
to
try
it
any
longer
i
am
dissapointed
that
i
dont
taste
what
i
was
expecting
from
a
birch
syrup
addition
but
maybe
it
is
more
apparent
in
a
younger
version
it
does
contribute
to
a
solid
alcohol
presence
that
works
well
with
the
rest
of
the
beer
and
is
sure
to
leave
you
glowing
a
well
made
beer
as
you
might
expect
from
a
collaboration
brew
between
breweries
of
such
reputations
an
interesting
sample
of
a
rarely
represented
style
in
the
american
beer
market
worth
a
try
but
not
to
die
for
overall
impression
while
enjoying
this
ontap
last
fall
i
enjoyed
it
even
more
while
in
bottle
im
surprised
the
maple
syrup
characteristics
are
still
huge
in
this
one
with
it
being
aged
highly
recommend
this
brew
and
will
be
looking
for
it
next
year
ive
held
onto
this
since
its
release
and
am
very
happy
with
the
results
its
quite
a
nice
beer
complex
and
flavorful
enjoy
to
not
be
boring
the
drinkability
was
very
high
which
was
an
added
bonus
for
me
seek
out
definitely
worth
trying
a
brown
bomber
by
my
friend
patrick
bownbrickred
colour
with
a
thin
head
the
was
destroyed
by
the
alcohol
nice
roastiness
with
caramel
on
the
nose
the
mouth
is
somewhat
thin
for
all
the
alcohol
nice
maple
syrup
the
birch
is
invisible
and
a
cacao
and
coffee
finale
a
nice
beer
somewhat
hard
to
define
the
flavors
are
packed
together
batch
2
750ml
corked
and
caged
bottle
served
in
a
snifter
poured
a
deep
brown
with
a
finger
of
tan
head
cocoa
and
some
licorice
in
the
aroma
molasses
and
more
licorice
in
the
flavor
seemed
a
little
hot
at
the
start
but
that
smoothed
out
fuller
side
of
medium
bodied
smooth
not
much
hop
presence
but
not
overly
sweet
for
such
a
malty
beer
very
long
dry
finish
with
more
cocoa
glad
i
got
to
try
this
but
i
cant
say
that
this
did
much
for
me
smooth
creamy
full
bodied
with
plenty
of
carbonation
and
a
sweet
aftertaste
a
nice
collaboration
beer
between
sierra
nevada
and
dogfish
head
overall
not
bad
but
not
amazing
doesnt
need
to
age
wont
get
any
better
review
is
for
version
1
overall
a
very
sweet
flavorful
and
potent
brew
that
definitely
should
be
sipped
and
savored
slowly
o
an
interesting
beer
the
different
syrups
add
an
interesting
complexity
overall
complex
yet
balanced
significant
abv
but
not
strong
in
the
taste
syrup
notes
are
also
well
incorporated
a
collaborative
effort
welldone
wow
just
noticing
the
abv
now
nice
o
good
beer
syrup
adds
a
nice
addition
i
thought
it
might
use
a
few
months
in
the
cellar
to
see
what
comes
of
some
aging
very
nicely
done
great
complexity
any
malt
lover
should
try
this
do
this
infrequent
offering
from
the
collaborative
minds
of
sierra
nevada
and
dogfish
head
could
serve
as
an
archetypal
american
strong
dark
ale
while
very
maltfocused
it
is
otherwise
balanced
and
without
clear
weakness
for
those
that
think
imperfection
is
beautiful
there
is
nothing
here
that
stands
out
while
it
is
obviously
wellmade
it
lacks
some
special
trait
that
could
simultaneously
earn
loyalty
from
some
and
enmity
from
others
compared
to
the
2009
vintage
this
seems
safer
with
less
maple
character
less
booze
presence
and
overall
just
a
lighter
and
more
approachable
beer
o
definate
crowdpleaser
i
cant
really
fault
this
beer
other
than
its
not
amazing
this
beer
is
what
all
good
brown
ales
want
to
be
when
they
grow
up
tasty
winter
warmer
but
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
and
not
very
complex
great
packaging
though
and
probably
quite
cellarworthy
massive
yummy
beast
just
right
for
the
holidaze
season
o
this
is
a
great
beer
really
rich
and
complex
and
delicious
for
such
a
strong
beer
the
alcohol
is
almost
entirely
disguised
and
only
shows
up
as
a
slight
warming
feeling
afterwards
o
the
profile
is
complex
with
a
brisk
ginger
spiciness
and
a
ice
depth
of
flavor
a
very
nice
brew
o
above
average
for
style
really
interesting
and
pretty
tasty
stuff
i
like
the
syrup
addition
the
prune
flavor
seemed
a
bit
overdone
imho
but
that
has
never
been
my
favorite
part
of
the
stout
style
overall
life
and
limb
is
an
interesting
drinking
experience
another
swell
beer
from
two
of
the
most
respected
brewers
in
the
states
dreally
easy
drinking
high
abv
stout
its
a
little
sweet
for
my
taste
but
still
a
very
solid
beer
o
i
could
easily
drink
one
or
two
of
these
especially
with
dessert
o
sweet
very
sweet
for
a
strong
ale
but
a
good
example
of
a
string
ale
and
an
example
of
what
a
great
collaboration
beer
and
a
beer
can
be
in
general
o
looked
amazing
but
didnt
really
do
too
much
after
that
somewhat
messy
flavors
that
seemed
like
something
was
missing
i
would
hunt
this
down
again
but
definitely
try
it
again
o
this
one
is
big
and
malty
with
a
fair
dose
of
alcohol
although
it
doesnt
detract
from
my
enjoyment
a
very
nice
brew
and
one
id
like
to
see
develop
with
some
age
this
aint
drankin
too
well
papery
molasses
and
generally
just
pretty
dull
o
i
found
life
limb
to
be
a
tasty
mapleflavored
brew
it
was
enjoyable
and
a
beer
i
look
forward
to
having
again
even
if
for
the
price
there
might
be
others
id
rather
check
out
final
thought
10
a
pop
and
9
abv
price
is
high
but
very
excellent
o
not
my
cup
of
tea
i
can
tell
it
is
well
made
perhaps
it
would
pair
well
with
a
rich
dessert
to
provide
some
complimentary
flavors
but
as
a
standalone
beer
ill
pass
i
was
looking
forward
to
this
beer
and
i
was
sadly
let
down
i
did
not
enjoy
this
almost
a
drain
pour
very
hard
to
get
down
the
maple
syrup
really
took
a
back
seat
too
astringent
and
seem
to
have
almost
a
belgian
like
ester
thing
going
on
i
wont
come
back
to
this
i
like
the
color
its
dark
almost
opaque
theres
a
good
head
with
a
tan
color
i
cant
smell
much
but
that
could
be
my
nose
i
get
a
faint
molasses
smell
the
taste
is
quite
good
i
can
detect
maple
but
its
not
overwhelming
i
can
pick
up
some
molasses
taste
and
roasty
malts
theres
a
pleasant
alcohol
warmth
the
first
thing
i
noticed
with
this
beer
was
that
it
was
a
brown
tan
color
it
had
a
sweet
maple
smell
the
taste
was
a
full
bodied
ale
with
malt
characteristics
and
a
sweet
taste
of
maple
that
was
a
compliment
to
the
malts
and
didnt
hinder
them
it
had
a
hint
of
birch
in
the
finish
which
added
to
the
experience
id
have
to
say
this
beer
is
another
good
example
of
why
collaborations
between
breweries
is
good
in
craft
beer
cheers
i
give
two
schlitz
for
this
syrupy
treat
one
for
life
and
one
for
limb
overall
not
a
bad
beer
i
really
enjoy
big
boozey
and
heavy
american
strong
ale
that
is
not
this
beer
it
at
the
other
end
of
the
spectrum
its
flavorful
for
not
being
barrel
aged
was
hoping
the
maple
and
birch
syrups
would
have
brought
more
flavors
and
complexity
into
this
beer
interesting
and
unique
ale
the
maple
really
comes
through
probably
the
birch
syrup
too
but
ive
never
had
that
before
so
i
dont
know
what
to
look
for
very
nice
aroma
almost
has
the
effect
of
a
barrel
aged
beer
such
as
a
scotch
ale
excessive
sweetness
does
get
in
the
way
of
this
being
truly
special
however
overall
this
is
a
pretty
damn
good
beer
not
incredible
but
its
different
from
most
beers
and
stands
out
from
others
good
price
very
glad
i
tried
this
and
would
definitly
reccomend
to
anyone
aging
potential
but
a
pretty
average
beer
off
the
shelf
i
like
how
this
beer
feels
but
the
taste
is
generic
my
first
sip
presented
a
little
sweetness
but
it
disappeared
may
try
it
again
in
the
future
i
think
this
is
aging
pretty
nicely
the
flavors
have
melded
pretty
well
but
im
not
sure
if
the
burnt
raisin
flavor
will
ever
become
more
pleasing
i
would
bet
the
alcohol
heat
would
dissipate
more
over
time
o
this
was
really
good
it
was
worth
the
wait
thanks
to
madarab55
for
sharing
i
bought
1
bottle
to
start
with
and
quickly
went
back
to
buy
a
couple
more
if
it
was
not
for
the
price
i
would
have
easily
bought
a
couple
cases
hot
from
alcohol
but
feels
just
right
to
me
for
the
american
strong
ale
it
is
definitely
something
id
come
back
to
for
dessert
or
a
nightcap
fuller
body
decent
carbonation
a
little
chewy
and
lingering
on
the
tongue
this
was
a
nice
combo
with
the
turkey
potatoes
gravy
etc
plenty
of
complex
flavors
and
i
like
the
uniqueness
of
the
maple
and
birch
the
barrel
aged
version
definitely
takes
this
to
another
level
though
this
beer
is
good
once
you
get
past
the
alcohol
the
underneath
is
great
malty
and
dark
fruit
like
great
for
this
time
of
year
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
i
was
hoping
a
lite
more
sweetness
came
through
in
its
flavor
about
one
finger
width
of
head
that
quickly
disparate
the
color
is
a
very
dark
amber
brown
the
nose
is
interesting
there
is
some
dark
fruit
smell
like
figs
then
a
touch
of
sweetness
and
a
little
caramel
also
there
is
an
alcohol
smell
but
its
very
faint
compared
to
the
2009
i
had
when
it
first
came
out
this
beer
did
a
180
originally
it
was
extremely
boozy
and
over
sweet
with
two
years
of
age
this
has
mellowed
out
extremely
the
booze
taste
is
all
but
gone
just
like
in
the
nose
i
get
dark
fruit
flavors
like
fig
or
black
cherry
and
a
hint
of
maple
the
mouthfeel
got
better
with
age
as
well
originally
it
was
it
very
slick
and
viscous
on
the
palate
now
it
is
very
light
and
the
flavor
does
not
linger
on
your
touge
over
all
this
is
with
a
year
age
on
it
an
above
average
beer
very
soild
i
recommend
drinking
your
2009s
now
o
a
wellbalanced
beer
that
successfully
represents
its
style
beyond
that
however
nothing
special
its
tasty
but
theres
not
anything
spectacular
or
unique
about
it
if
i
found
it
on
tap
i
would
order
it
to
compare
but
i
would
not
buy
it
bottled
again
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
it
was
an
interesting
mix
and
very
tasty
with
that
being
said
i
could
probably
only
drink
one
of
these
at
a
time
a
unique
offering
not
spectacular
but
interesting
overall
pretty
good
brew
nice
malty
treat
alcohol
is
non
factor
except
for
the
tummy
warming
this
collaboration
brew
is
dark
black
brown
in
color
with
a
thick
light
brown
head
and
blanketing
lace
the
aroma
is
of
a
deep
but
mellow
malt
with
a
little
sharp
vinegar
yeast
the
flavor
comes
on
with
a
thick
junipermalt
with
sugary
cider
bite
it
is
pleasantly
carbonated
with
tiny
bubbles
and
ultimately
delivers
a
velvetty
but
near
syrupy
feel
with
a
mediumheavy
body
theres
some
alcohol
notable
but
it
does
not
distract
from
what
is
overall
a
damn
good
brew
very
nice
into
a
wine
glass
a
very
dark
brown
color
black
really
rests
under
a
mild
layer
of
head
aroma
is
a
cool
and
mellow
sweet
milk
and
dark
cocoa
noted
one
a
smooth
and
crisply
carbonated
feel
flows
on
through
with
harmonizing
notes
of
sweet
dark
roasted
malt
and
caramel
sweet
flavoring
here
is
really
delicious
and
i
cant
help
but
think
of
the
pure
maple
syrup
and
birch
syrup
that
may
contribute
to
that
fresh
dark
coffee
noted
finish
goes
together
very
well
with
a
cheddar
cheese
beef
burger
and
fries
maple
sweetness
and
dark
malt
flavors
a
weak
nose
though
compared
to
what
i
was
expecting
oh
well
still
enjoyable
pours
a
dark
brown
with
large
three
finger
tan
head
nose
is
sweet
caramel
malt
molasses
dark
fruit
plum
raisins
brown
sugar
and
some
some
alcohol
taste
is
similar
with
a
large
emphasis
on
the
sweet
malt
and
molasses
brown
sugar
is
still
evident
some
heat
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
heavy
slightly
creamy
with
a
wet
and
satisfying
finish
overall
a
great
sipper
of
a
beer
not
getting
too
much
maple
syrup
but
as
it
warms
that
could
change
molasses
is
strong
fridge
temp
this
is
a
very
tasty
beer
thats
easy
to
drink
for
its
10
abv
cheers
a
solid
enough
beer
but
one
that
i
wish
had
a
bit
more
depth
of
flavor
particularly
given
the
abv
pours
black
with
a
fair
head
especially
for
the
strength
of
the
beer
smells
a
little
hot
but
doesnt
taste
it
the
maple
here
is
very
subtle
and
the
birch
is
even
more
so
this
is
a
shame
because
the
bitter
and
wintergreen
notes
of
birch
could
work
well
here
if
they
were
amped
up
there
is
a
light
nutty
sweetness
with
a
faint
aftertaste
of
maple
candy
some
woodiness
and
just
a
hint
of
birchy
wintergreen
very
smooth
perhaps
a
tad
too
much
so
with
a
bit
more
oomph
this
could
be
a
great
beer
i
would
have
to
say
this
is
a
pretty
good
american
strong
overall
i
think
this
beer
would
benefit
from
some
time
in
a
barrel
actually
o
a
good
example
of
the
style
im
not
one
who
prefers
one
packaging
over
the
other
tap
beer
is
better
than
bottles
without
at
least
trying
it
and
have
reason
to
prefer
one
over
the
other
but
i
can
point
out
a
more
pronounced
maple
flavor
and
aroma
in
the
beer
and
its
a
touch
sweeter
the
beer
is
fuller
bodied
than
its
thin
relative
found
in
bottles
if
you
didnt
enjoy
the
bottle
and
happen
upon
this
on
draught
try
it
out
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
mediumbodied
but
can
appear
heavy
at
times
not
a
bad
brew
but
the
offerings
ive
had
from
russian
river
are
much
better
this
lacks
a
sortof
punch
to
it
i
somewhat
feel
like
they
forgot
to
tag
a
taste
onto
the
beers
finish
overall
a
good
beer
i
had
just
hoped
for
better
its
good
but
its
a
sipper
o
awesome
beer
this
is
probably
one
of
my
favorite
dark
beers
has
a
lot
of
aromas
flavors
that
work
well
together
to
make
a
really
nice
beer
o
a
very
interesting
project
but
it
works
very
good
o
very
good
beer
drinkable
but
disappointing
this
wasnt
worth
the
hype
this
would
be
a
decent
barleywine
but
its
billed
as
something
different
and
sold
at
a
steep
price
o
not
sure
if
id
buy
it
again
based
on
the
price
tag
but
its
a
damn
good
beer
enjoying
it
pours
a
dark
toffee
brown
thin
creamy
offwhite
head
aroma
is
a
bit
medicinal
with
vague
hints
of
maple
malt
forward
and
warming
no
hop
aroma
or
flavor
just
the
requisite
bitterness
i
wish
the
maple
and
birch
described
were
more
prominent
smooth
and
easy
drinking
having
tried
both
batches
i
would
say
that
there
is
no
significant
difference
other
than
age
at
this
point
at
first
look
this
is
gonna
be
an
amazing
brew
lots
of
aroma
chocolate
and
syrup
nice
fruit
and
malt
little
head
and
this
thing
packs
an
amazing
punch
of
flavor
in
general
this
reminds
me
a
lot
of
cbs
i
guess
just
in
the
fact
that
they
both
have
a
bit
of
this
syrup
thing
going
on
i
nice
sipper
i
would
love
to
be
able
to
drink
this
stuff
on
the
regular
but
availability
has
me
beat
overall
this
and
celebration
are
my
favs
from
sierra
nevada
this
beer
is
delicious
wish
i
could
get
my
hands
on
the
barrel
aged
version
i
wish
there
was
a
bit
more
maple
tones
but
molasses
is
close
o
wow
i
really
liked
this
one
give
me
more
i
have
another
bottle
that
im
aging
until
march
i
will
have
to
see
if
that
brings
out
more
of
the
maple
and
birch
flavors
o
4
overall
good
beer
but
i
think
questionable
lines
didnt
help
it
had
a
good
quality
of
woodsiness
and
a
great
story
the
maple
sap
is
definitely
apparent
in
flavor
and
definitely
warrants
and
extended
tasting
apparently
this
is
a
special
beer
im
really
happy
i
had
the
opportunity
to
buy
two
bottles
one
to
drink
now
this
review
and
one
to
age
im
hoping
the
aging
will
pick
up
some
complexity
as
this
beer
was
really
good
but
not
as
exciting
as
i
was
hoping
for
o
i
liked
this
beer
i
really
like
the
idea
behind
the
name
and
i
am
thrilled
to
see
breweries
like
dogfish
head
and
sierra
nevada
encouraging
creativity
i
cannot
wait
to
have
the
one
aging
in
the
basement
in
a
few
years
not
a
very
flavorful
strong
ale
it
has
the
body
but
there
just
isnt
a
flavor
that
really
pops
the
abv
is
pretty
well
hidden
though
o
very
good
would
love
to
enjoy
this
again
i
was
apprehensive
of
this
beer
before
drinking
thinking
it
would
be
too
malty
and
heavy
but
sn
and
dfh
did
a
great
job
with
this
its
an
easily
drinkable
beer
especially
for
its
abv
speaking
of
which
you
would
never
guess
this
is
in
the
double
digits
unless
you
look
on
the
label
i
quite
liked
this
dark
beer
more
than
most
ris
beers
out
there
can
the
future
of
dark
craft
beer
please
head
in
this
direction
overall
very
good
beer
overall
the
booze
comes
on
strong
at
the
finish
but
i
can
accept
that
with
an
american
strong
ale
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
and
would
definitely
recommend
it
if
you
are
able
to
locate
it
overall
this
is
a
big
winner
as
the
bottle
says
its
one
to
savor
seek
it
out
overall
they
were
not
kidding
when
they
said
that
age
does
this
beer
well
other
reviews
have
said
that
the
flavors
are
disjointed
however
i
can
honestly
say
that
the
hop
bitter
the
smoothwoodysweet
syrups
and
the
fairly
intense
malts
have
been
brought
together
with
a
bit
of
aging
i
will
get
another
bottle
of
this
and
age
it
at
least
a
year
a
really
good
beer
from
two
of
my
favorite
breweries
its
worth
the
pick
up
totally
its
also
pretty
memorable
ill
get
another
i
first
had
a
bourbon
barrel
aged
life
and
limb
at
a
beer
fest
and
thought
it
was
fantastic
which
prompted
me
to
buy
a
few
bottles
of
the
new
batch
the
normal
life
and
limb
isnt
as
complex
as
the
barrelaged
version
but
it
is
still
a
solid
beer
it
hides
the
high
abv
quite
well
overall
my
4oz
serving
is
sufficient
wont
need
a
bottle
poured
from
bottle
into
pint
probably
not
the
best
choice
anyhow
i
was
excited
sierra
dogfish
head
my
favorites
not
my
favorite
beer
malty
chocolate
head
very
thin
and
minimal
lacing
dark
chocolate
color
was
a
nice
looking
beer
the
first
sip
is
dark
chocolate
molasses
brown
sugar
sugar
malt
yes
maybe
i
cannot
stand
a
beer
with
no
bitterness
honestly
would
drink
it
again
just
to
prove
myself
wrong
mouthfeel
was
the
blandness
how
can
a
beer
this
thick
be
so
watery
just
not
my
cup
ba
review
250
verdict
delightful
surprised
to
find
it
so
out
of
the
way
from
my
home
base
i
will
definitely
check
this
out
in
bottle
form
if
i
can
find
it
back
home
o
heavy
and
sweet
but
a
delicious
treat
that
will
leave
your
pallet
full
would
be
a
very
nice
option
for
a
good
desert
beer
to
sip
on
for
a
little
while
overall
i
enjoyed
it
enough
to
get
my
moneys
worth
but
would
not
seek
out
again
due
to
high
price
point
and
availability
gone
everywhere
still
it
was
a
very
solid
collab
that
i
am
glad
i
got
to
try
another
sn
classic
twist
on
something
that
goes
well
along
with
the
30th
anniversary
stuff
very
good
beer
hides
the
alcohol
well
and
drinks
smooth
o
a
great
beer
in
my
opinion
collaborated
between
sierra
nevada
and
dogfishead
how
can
you
really
go
wrong
cheers
to
collaborations
overall
this
is
a
very
unique
beer
i
am
glad
i
tried
it
at
the
suggestion
of
fellow
bas
if
you
like
palo
santo
marron
chances
are
youll
like
this
beer
too
do
i
really
wanted
to
like
this
but
its
just
a
little
too
hot
im
debating
buying
another
to
age
for
a
bit
but
not
sure
just
not
really
that
impressed
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
sn
in
general
but
i
expected
better
of
dfh
couldnt
finish
this
bomber
just
think
this
one
might
not
be
best
as
fresh
as
it
is
o
i
wish
this
came
in
6ers
i
would
buy
this
as
my
regular
beer
this
is
one
of
the
most
subtly
flavorful
beers
i
have
ever
tried
highly
recommend
o
this
beer
was
really
good
i
am
never
short
of
amazed
by
sierra
nevada
this
was
a
dandy
especially
on
tap
o
this
was
an
interesting
one
but
kind
off
a
miss
for
me
its
not
awful
but
not
really
my
cupotea
thanks
to
mjtiernan
for
sending
this
in
a
trade
pours
a
light
brown
with
a
thin
head
that
doesnt
last
or
leave
lacing
smells
of
wood
syrup
and
citrus
tastes
of
syrup
and
trees
with
a
hint
of
orange
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
syrupy
definatly
a
thick
beer
that
needs
to
be
shared
with
others
too
much
for
me
in
one
sitting
very
well
worth
trying
this
one
o
i
honestly
expected
a
better
beer
from
a
dogfishsierra
nevada
collaboration
beer
way
too
syrupy
sweet
i
would
not
buy
this
again
pours
a
deep
chestnut
color
with
a
thin
wispy
head
that
fades
into
to
oblivion
quickly
nose
is
actually
fairly
light
a
bit
of
grain
and
syrup
notes
of
caramel
vanilla
coffee
in
the
taste
but
a
bit
cloying
as
it
warms
up
it
seems
to
become
sweeter
and
becomes
a
chore
to
finish
the
whole
bottle
its
a
well
crafted
beer
without
a
doubt
but
i
dont
think
id
buy
it
again
its
definitely
on
the
hot
side
it
would
probably
benefit
from
aging
for
a
year
or
two
d
obviously
the
drinkability
is
very
low
on
this
this
beer
should
be
had
for
dessert
not
with
desert
for
desert
this
wonderful
beer
is
poured
into
a
small
brandy
snifter
glass
it
arrives
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
dark
tan
head
the
head
dissipates
quickly
with
very
little
lacing
aromas
of
chocolate
cocoa
and
hints
of
vanilla
hit
the
nose
as
i
take
the
first
sip
the
first
sip
explodes
in
my
mouth
with
flavors
spicy
chocolate
cocoa
with
hints
of
vanilla
and
coconut
it
is
a
creamy
beer
with
very
little
bitterness
but
the
spicy
chocolate
lingers
for
a
long
time
had
it
at
livingoods
in
plattsburgh
ny
with
a
coffee
peppercorn
encrusted
sirloin
the
combo
is
fantastic
d
tasty
with
a
good
complexity
goes
down
dangerously
easy
not
too
filling
strong
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
good
high
octane
beer
worth
drinking
for
a
long
time
i
was
down
in
rehobeth
beach
for
a
vacation
and
went
to
the
dfh
brewpub
almost
every
day
the
one
beer
i
kept
coming
back
for
was
life
and
limb
i
had
to
drink
this
out
of
a
bottle
in
the
brewpub
because
i
couldnt
leave
with
it
i
tried
everything
to
get
a
couple
of
these
bottles
out
of
the
brewpub
but
to
no
avail
so
i
drank
atleast
3
or
4
of
them
while
i
was
at
rehobeth
beach
for
the
week
every
time
it
was
the
same
things
as
i
ordered
it
the
waitress
was
like
are
you
sure
you
know
its
a
big
bottle
right
oh
trust
me
i
knew
and
man
was
it
worth
it
so
out
of
the
22
or
24oz
little
fatty
bottle
it
pours
dark
brown
with
a
tanish
head
smell
is
of
sweet
caramel
and
chocolate
taste
was
sweet
like
maple
syrup
and
finished
a
little
bitter
malt
much
like
semi
sweet
chocolate
this
beer
was
great
very
upset
i
cant
get
more
of
this
beer
batch
one
luckly
they
came
out
with
a
second
batch
but
they
taste
slightly
different
maybe
it
was
just
sweeter
because
of
the
atmosphere
i
was
drinking
it
in
this
is
honestly
one
of
my
favorite
beers
overall
good
beer
the
flavor
profile
seems
a
bit
off
somehow
o
i
enjoyed
this
beer
while
it
wasnt
amazing
its
still
a
solid
colaboration
looking
forward
to
seeing
how
my
other
bottle
holds
up
to
age
750ml
bottle
second
release
i
assume
from
the
2
at
the
bottom
of
the
label
purchased
at
mckinnons
in
portsmouth
pours
a
dark
brickred
crystalclear
body
with
nearly
two
inches
of
tancolored
head
that
persists
rather
nicely
smells
fruity
sweet
with
malty
molasses
notes
sweet
maltiness
mixes
with
booziness
brown
sugar
molasses
caramel
with
slight
woody
and
dark
chocolate
notes
to
round
the
whole
thing
out
medium
in
both
body
and
carbonation
drinkable
enough
though
its
a
little
boozy
and
just
slightly
astringent
which
pushes
this
beer
into
sipper
territory
interesting
and
it
grows
on
me
for
sure
especially
as
it
warms
some
of
the
flavors
remind
me
of
drinking
birch
beer
at
the
fair
as
a
kid
glad
i
tried
it
but
im
not
positive
id
be
rushing
out
buying
it
again
any
time
soon
notes
lots
of
strong
flavors
that
work
together
well
very
nice
overall
i
was
surprised
how
smooth
the
new
batch
is
theyre
both
very
good
in
my
opinion
o
i
thought
it
was
an
interesting
beer
and
was
expecting
a
ton
of
syrupy
sweetness
but
was
surprised
how
well
balanced
it
was
it
was
pretty
boozy
but
being
10
abv
it
still
was
pretty
drinkable
going
to
let
my
bottle
sit
for
a
while
and
see
what
happens
pours
a
black
color
13
inch
head
of
an
offtan
color
slight
retention
and
decent
lacing
smells
of
hops
sweet
malt
slight
roasted
malt
slight
dark
citrus
alcohol
and
spice
fits
the
style
of
an
american
strong
ale
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
sweet
malt
slight
citrus
slight
hop
hint
of
roasted
malt
slight
spice
alcohol
and
hint
of
earthy
malt
overall
great
aroma
body
blend
and
complexity
im
happy
i
picked
this
up
and
even
happier
that
ill
be
able
to
try
it
again
in
the
future
i
would
say
sit
this
one
down
for
at
least
a
year
if
not
longer
i
believe
that
the
sweetness
and
booze
will
balance
itself
out
nicely
but
its
a
bit
messy
fresh
o
a
bit
harsh
and
boozy
at
its
current
state
it
may
age
pretty
well
overall
good
beer
i
would
consider
getting
another
but
i
would
not
cellar
it
i
think
it
would
be
sweeter
later
and
that
would
take
away
from
the
beer
not
to
mention
all
the
people
that
have
tried
to
cellar
it
and
it
exploded
on
them
45
overall
a
pretty
interesting
beer
from
sierra
nevada
and
dogfish
head
the
maple
syrup
is
a
nice
touch
not
something
youd
expect
to
see
in
a
beer
a
nice
sipper
overall
a
good
layered
ale
great
with
italian
bread
and
probably
just
by
itself
i
have
a
couple
more
bottles
of
these
and
i
will
edit
my
review
if
the
taste
changes
much
with
some
time
o
this
2nd
edition
of
life
and
limb
is
amazing
it
is
way
better
than
the
first
brewing
of
life
and
limb
2
years
ago
i
am
really
enjoying
the
more
birch
roast
character
that
was
added
to
this
variation
the
last
life
and
limb
had
a
lot
o
fussel
heat
and
was
quite
maplely
sweet
even
after
a
year
of
aging
the
first
life
and
limb
gained
even
more
fussel
and
maple
sweetness
but
with
this
one
i
think
it
will
age
very
well
and
may
gain
more
of
a
maplebirch
profile
this
variation
has
no
fussel
heat
and
almost
is
a
very
sessionable
beer
to
drink
this
one
is
very
outstanding
i
really
like
this
beer
its
got
some
portermilk
stout
similarities
which
i
enjoy
i
can
see
how
some
wont
appreciate
this
collaboration
between
sierra
nevada
and
dogfish
head
but
its
right
up
my
alley
o
unique
beer
all
the
way
the
double
peak
flavor
sweetfig
and
then
roastedtoasted
barley
had
me
taking
more
and
more
sips
reminded
me
of
the
jack
rabbit
roller
coaster
at
kennywood
with
the
doubledip
just
after
getting
hit
with
the
first
wave
of
flavor
you
get
smacked
with
the
next
and
those
two
waves
together
is
what
makes
it
so
interesting
i
definitely
want
to
find
another
to
age
to
see
where
these
flavors
go
o
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
here
with
this
one
but
its
a
fine
brew
really
nice
flavors
come
out
and
they
blend
well
but
you
still
taste
each
warming
booze
makes
it
a
winnder
in
my
book
not
overpowering
but
you
feel
it
nice
brew
all
around
o
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
really
good
beer
i
think
this
is
a
great
collaboration
between
two
wonderful
breweries
i
thought
it
was
nicely
down
and
would
get
it
again
overall
this
is
great
beer
and
it
says
much
of
the
quality
of
manufacturing
that
the
10
2
abv
is
almost
entirely
undetectable
making
this
quite
a
dangerous
beverage
even
better
the
flavors
dont
diminish
during
subsequent
mouthfuls
meaning
the
beer
tastes
just
as
good
halfway
through
the
bottle
well
worth
a
try
o
i
love
it
it
is
a
sipper
but
the
sweetness
makes
it
enjoyable
i
am
gonna
grab
some
more
for
the
cellar
sierra
and
dfh
architects
of
craft
beer
pours
a
deep
amber
to
black
with
a
light
brown
head
in
the
aroma
roaty
woody
and
maple
syrup
in
the
taste
caramel
maple
syrup
and
a
dry
woody
flavor
a
small
bite
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
small
dry
maple
syrup
and
wood
like
aftertaste
a
bit
sticky
sweet
but
a
nice
wood
presence
and
it
grows
on
you
for
sure
o
could
a
bit
more
mapley
o
quite
good
strong
but
not
overpowering
an
enjoyable
sipper
very
dark
pour
with
a
light
beige
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
long
long
time
aroma
is
very
earthy
oak
maple
and
birch
taste
is
nice
and
big
sweet
maple
caramel
dark
fruits
malty
and
crisp
alcohol
nice
and
creamy
mouthfeel
made
you
lick
your
lips
by
the
end
of
the
bottle
you
could
tell
it
was
a
10
2
alcohol
one
thing
i
really
loved
in
this
brew
was
the
last
sip
of
each
of
those
glasses
where
just
that
bit
of
head
is
left
like
slurping
the
foam
off
the
top
of
a
cappacinno
delicious
o
a
very
good
beer
and
i
look
forward
to
what
this
beer
has
to
offer
in
a
year
from
now
overall
this
beer
is
pretty
good
they
did
a
good
job
playing
some
really
strong
flavors
and
aromas
off
each
other
nicely
it
does
get
a
bit
to
sugary
in
the
taste
for
my
liking
but
that
is
really
the
only
negative
otherwise
a
solid
beer
certainly
one
of
the
most
unique
brews
i
have
ever
tasted
poured
a
slightly
red
hue
of
dark
brown
with
a
thin
creamcolored
head
the
smell
was
sharp
and
earthy
sweet
and
pungent
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
where
i
got
hung
up
what
is
that
it
isnt
unpleasant
bit
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
it
i
sipped
on
an
8oz
pour
for
about
an
hour
trying
to
figure
it
out
upon
consultation
with
the
bartender
i
discovered
it
to
be
alaskan
birch
syrup
aha
i
enjoyed
my
second
glass
much
better
now
that
i
understood
the
ingredient
that
gave
it
such
an
unconventional
taste
could
probably
make
a
night
of
drinking
this
beer
but
i
commend
the
creativity
definitely
worth
a
try
if
you
can
find
it
overall
i
found
it
to
be
both
interesting
and
enjoyable
when
to
be
honest
i
was
expecting
neither
reminded
me
of
hebrew
jewbelation
twelve
mixed
with
a
bit
of
palo
santo
though
maybe
thats
just
the
steakumm
talking
dark
opaque
appearance
with
white
head
anise
coffee
cherry
chocolate
molasses
flavors
mouthfeel
is
most
like
the
aftertaste
youd
et
from
coffee
bitterness
and
sweetness
in
a
nice
union
a
little
on
the
syrupy
end
aroma
is
sugary
boozy
overall
two
bottles
of
this
is
pretty
good
for
me
lots
of
depth
was
curious
exactly
what
this
beer
would
be
like
contrary
to
my
expectations
its
mostly
quite
subtle
a
nice
opaque
brown
appearance
with
a
slight
brown
foamy
head
that
sits
on
top
a
little
bit
of
spotty
lacing
smell
is
very
clean
with
a
tad
of
chocolatey
malt
and
the
slightest
traces
of
potato
salt
and
a
slight
souring
element
taste
is
slightly
sweet
chocolate
malt
forward
with
a
huge
variety
of
subtle
flavors
the
flavors
overall
are
very
subdued
and
slight
but
with
good
composure
a
really
nice
beer
that
i
could
see
benefitting
from
age
mo
the
beer
doesnt
have
any
overpowering
characteristics
the
flavors
are
not
too
strong
and
the
carbonation
really
helps
bring
out
the
flavors
of
the
beer
very
enjoyable
beer
life
and
limb
provides
a
number
of
flavors
and
aromas
that
i
do
not
see
often
in
beer
it
is
a
great
change
of
pace
beer
not
a
hard
beer
to
drink
though
it
is
a
bit
more
of
a
sipper
than
most
this
is
a
bottle
i
will
probably
pick
up
again
not
one
i
will
drink
regularly
but
one
i
would
appreciate
on
occasion
and
be
interest
to
see
how
it
evolves
with
age
o
like
most
any
asa
its
always
an
adventure
this
one
did
bring
far
more
intricate
flavors
to
the
table
than
other
asas
ive
had
though
nice
big
mansion
of
a
drink
this
one
is
mouthfeel
is
still
thick
sticky
which
isnt
inappropriate
for
a
strong
ale
overall
i
think
its
pretty
good
cork
and
caged
version
dark
brown
pour
with
a
nice
foamy
beige
head
dissipates
quickly
with
sparse
lacing
charred
malt
in
the
nose
slightly
boozey
taste
is
fairly
nuetered
what
am
i
supposed
to
be
getting
here
maple
no
at
least
i
am
not
getting
it
not
cloyingly
sweet
at
all
and
not
bitter
not
much
of
a
hop
profile
cannot
place
the
taste
but
the
only
thing
that
comes
to
mind
is
charred
meat
body
is
good
smooth
and
easy
drinking
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
overall
this
is
a
fairly
underwhelming
beer
its
main
attraction
is
that
is
that
it
is
a
high
abv
that
is
relatively
not
noticeable
with
a
smooth
body
that
leads
to
easy
sipping
but
taste
aromoa
its
just
not
there
for
me
overall
an
added
alcohol
buzz
to
the
nights
consumption
without
the
burn
but
not
much
else
this
is
a
beer
that
is
just
there
without
contributing
much
more
not
a
repeat
purchase
for
me
the
rest
a
definite
malt
bomb
certainly
worth
a
try
and
i
think
ill
be
picking
up
another
bottle
to
sit
on
for
a
year
or
two
the
finish
took
me
by
surprise
and
i
was
pleased
that
it
didnt
taste
as
hot
as
i
was
anticipating
from
the
aroma
this
is
an
interesting
beer
that
tastes
like
a
belgian
in
many
aspects
but
is
different
enough
to
make
it
worthwhile
overrated
in
my
opinion
o
just
as
i
remembered
from
2009
a
very
solid
effort
from
sierra
dogfish
head
like
the
smooth
taste
and
full
flavors
molasses
fig
chocolate
wood
that
changed
as
the
beer
warmed
enjoyed
the
combination
of
flavors
and
the
subtle
carbonation
have
a
couple
im
sitting
on
for
late
fall
to
see
how
they
age
a
must
try
asa
d
very
well
constructed
and
tasty
id
like
to
try
one
with
some
age
on
it
but
as
others
have
said
it
is
drinking
just
fine
right
now
recommended
overall
this
is
a
seriously
strong
but
thoroughly
enjoyable
asa
its
the
kind
of
beer
that
separates
a
beer
advocate
from
the
rest
of
the
population
if
you
can
find
it
still
grab
it
and
than
grab
another
to
put
in
the
cellar
i
have
a
sneaking
suspicion
that
this
will
age
very
gracefully
hopefully
i
can
find
another
cheers
overall
its
been
a
while
since
ive
had
a
good
asa
im
glad
i
grabbed
two
bottles
of
this
brew
i
sense
this
will
age
out
well
in
my
cellar
overall
a
solid
brew
i
am
glad
that
i
got
my
hands
on
two
bottles
i
am
going
to
sit
on
one
for
a
while
and
see
how
it
ages
and
mellows
out
defiantly
worth
picking
up
if
you
can
still
find
it
opinion
this
is
a
pretty
darn
good
beer
overall
i
am
happy
with
it
it
has
a
good
blend
of
hops
malt
sweetness
malt
blend
etc
i
would
definitely
drink
this
beer
again
and
that
is
the
highest
testament
i
can
give
a
beer
as
much
as
these
things
can
be
worth
the
price
tag
this
beer
is
its
tasty
and
unique
and
its
so
much
better
than
any
other
beer
with
syrup
that
ive
had
theyre
awful
when
done
wrong
might
be
this
years
thanksgiving
beer
mouthfeel
sugary
and
nice
smooth
good
strong
body
decent
to
light
carbonation
96
pours
a
dark
brown
with
some
red
highlights
creamy
light
brown
head
with
good
retention
and
some
sticky
lacing
scent
is
quit
ebig
with
lots
of
dark
fruit
notes
mingling
with
roasted
grains
dry
wood
and
flashes
of
sweetness
coming
from
notes
of
birch
beer
and
maple
syrup
taste
follows
scent
in
its
construction
quite
complex
and
well
blended
dark
fruit
fig
prune
and
roasted
malts
are
the
star
notes
of
earth
and
wood
and
a
mildly
sweet
presence
of
syrup
and
rootbeer
higher
side
of
medium
bodied
good
carbonation
level
quite
a
satisfying
sipper
bold
scent
and
flavor
make
drinking
a
bomber
on
your
own
a
tough
task
low
light
brown
head
that
settles
out
fairly
quickly
aroma
of
toasty
malt
rich
flavor
of
dark
malts
and
a
bit
of
sweetness
upfront
velvety
maltiness
with
notes
of
brown
sugar
and
root
beer
some
cocoa
and
dark
fruit
offsetting
bitterness
is
just
firm
enough
to
be
present
without
taking
over
notes
of
marshmallow
and
leather
moderate
and
creamy
mouthfeel
a
finish
of
bitter
coffeeroasted
grain
and
espresso
a
really
nice
effort
overall
this
is
an
amazing
collaboration
full
flavored
smooth
and
big
cant
wait
to
get
more
bottles
of
this
if
you
see
it
in
the
store
it
is
definitely
worth
picking
up
cheers
beautiful
appearance
with
the
exception
of
the
minimal
lace
very
dark
brown
with
a
healthy
head
malty
aroma
with
a
touch
of
raisins
and
spicy
hopping
big
mouthfeel
lots
of
body
and
medium
carbonation
very
good
balance
leaning
somewhat
toward
the
malty
dried
fruit
is
also
evident
in
the
flavor
along
with
a
touch
of
oak
earthy
hopping
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
but
does
show
up
bittersweet
chocolate
finish
overall
not
bad
a
bit
boozy
glad
i
tried
it
though
needs
to
be
served
in
the
55
degree
range
to
help
balance
the
alcohol
and
flavor
a
big
beer
that
is
not
filling
the
alcohol
does
play
a
big
part
of
the
flavor
but
did
not
bother
me
much
after
the
first
few
sips
maybe
some
age
would
benefit
this
beer
interesting
and
worth
a
try
very
smooth
and
tasty
alcohol
not
detectable
complex
and
interesting
o
all
in
all
i
was
really
expecting
more
its
a
good
beer
but
not
amazing
it
starts
and
ends
nice
but
the
middle
is
lacking
im
not
really
digging
the
fruitiness
and
alcohol
burn
on
this
one
many
better
in
this
vast
style
o
sat
on
this
for
a
month
this
beer
looks
like
a
stout
almost
smells
like
a
stout
but
it
definitelyand
obviously
is
not
a
stout
delicious
admittedly
that
word
is
not
very
descriptive
but
it
is
all
i
have
for
now
will
purchase
again
comes
out
of
the
tap
a
luscious
warm
sable
with
a
fairly
thick
and
finebubbled
light
tan
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
while
malty
aroma
has
strong
molasses
and
caramel
notes
mouthfilling
flavor
has
a
malty
core
and
caramel
nutty
molasses
and
earthy
notes
plus
a
hint
of
honey
sweetness
fullbodied
texture
is
rather
smooth
and
has
a
firm
fine
tingle
risk
life
and
limb
for
this
un
oglad
i
was
able
to
try
this
seemed
similar
to
dfh
chicory
stout
it
was
very
earthy
and
abv
does
catch
up
to
you
o
an
awesome
brew
ill
definitely
watch
out
for
this
brew
for
years
to
come
thank
you
for
rereleasing
i
cant
wait
to
see
how
this
brew
develops
in
time
o
good
really
glad
i
found
a
bottle
hadnt
seen
it
before
worth
picking
up
if
you
find
a
bottle
very
enjoyable
just
not
anything
truly
exceptional
o
the
ontap
version
last
year
was
tasty
but
this
was
a
real
treat
the
mouthfeel
was
a
huge
step
up
750ml
bottle
15
i
dont
know
why
we
have
to
pay
so
much
for
this
dark
brown
almost
black
decent
head
smells
like
alcohol
sugar
and
malt
the
flavor
was
malty
and
sweet
like
a
certain
candy
i
once
had
and
cannot
remember
overall
not
bad
at
all
but
not
great
either
especially
given
the
price
paid
ill
pass
next
time
d
while
all
of
the
aspects
of
this
beer
are
pretty
good
they
dont
come
together
in
quite
the
symphony
i
had
hoped
for
one
year
later
its
still
darn
good
but
the
fading
of
the
hops
has
decreased
my
overall
interest
a
bit
alcohol
heat
is
much
reduced
o
yeah
i
wouldnt
buy
try
it
again
but
since
i
already
have
another
bottle
im
going
to
age
it
for
about
a
yr
before
i
try
it
again
o
definitely
an
interesting
beer
and
well
worth
checking
out
creamy
and
thick
mouthfeel
that
leave
a
semisticky
feel
behind
in
your
mouth
overall
and
nice
strong
maltforward
ale
that
is
a
pleasure
to
sip
on
throughout
the
evening
a
nice
malty
take
on
the
style
i
enjoyed
the
slant
this
took
a
great
fireside
sipper
imo
a
bit
overpriced
though
overall
sucked
sierra
nevada
is
quickly
falling
down
my
list
of
liked
breweries
with
beers
like
this
big
disappointment
9
dollars
ill
never
get
back
o
wow
delicious
now
certainly
this
one
will
continue
to
dry
out
and
develop
further
complexity
as
it
ages
cant
wait
o
lots
of
flavors
relatively
complex
an
odd
balance
definitely
a
sipper
o
had
this
when
it
first
came
out
on
tap
and
found
it
to
be
way
too
boozy
with
some
age
on
it
the
alcohol
is
calmed
down
aroma
is
sweet
but
i
dont
pick
up
on
any
syrup
its
roasty
and
heavy
the
fusel
alcohol
in
the
nose
worries
me
a
little
as
i
dive
in
but
the
taste
isnt
actually
that
harsh
i
definitely
pick
up
on
the
maple
syrup
cant
say
id
be
able
to
identify
beech
syrup
this
beer
became
pretty
great
as
it
warmed
a
fairly
complex
but
smooth
sipper
thats
likely
even
better
with
some
age
on
it
overall
i
found
this
beer
to
be
incredible
already
purchased
more
wrapped
each
bottle
into
a
plastic
bag
because
of
the
exploding
issue
it
seems
to
be
having
just
sent
one
to
a
buddy
of
mine
hope
it
doesnt
explode
in
route
if
you
have
been
debating
picking
one
up
my
vote
is
that
you
do
people
complain
about
the
hype
that
a
lot
of
beers
get
and
claim
that
few
live
up
to
it
in
my
experience
there
is
a
reason
that
the
hype
started
in
the
first
place
craft
beer
drinkers
are
not
stupid
and
are
rarely
swayed
by
hype
and
some
even
take
a
perverse
joy
in
countering
the
hype
and
panning
the
overhyped
beer
and
then
there
are
some
that
take
anything
done
by
the
brewery
of
the
weekmonthyear
as
gospel
and
overrate
it
in
the
case
of
this
beer
it
does
stand
up
to
the
hype
this
puts
the
craft
back
into
craft
beer
you
can
taste
the
care
and
precision
in
which
it
was
constructed
kudos
to
both
breweries
one
which
constantly
lives
up
to
their
press
and
one
that
sometimes
falls
short
but
gets
great
reviews
even
if
their
experiment
yielded
something
that
tastes
all
the
rest
of
their
experiments
overall
a
good
solid
beer
but
not
one
where
i
feel
it
necessary
to
grab
every
available
bottle
to
store
for
future
consumption
o
definitely
an
american
strong
ale
super
boozy
glad
i
bought
two
bottles
the
other
one
is
getting
laid
down
for
a
year
or
two
i
enjoyed
this
tulip
i
got
i
would
totally
order
it
again
i
poured
from
a
bomber
into
a
snifter
the
pour
is
dark
brown
big
foamy
head
lots
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
woody
dark
fruits
hints
of
maple
syrup
hot
alcohol
the
beer
is
sweet
wood
and
dark
fruit
notes
there
is
a
definite
boozy
feeling
with
this
one
the
body
is
full
good
carbonation
it
drinks
easier
than
its
high
abv
would
let
on
a
solid
beer
didnt
live
up
to
the
hype
for
me
but
still
very
enjoyable
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
would
happily
seek
it
out
again
i
had
batch
1
on
tap
last
year
no
review
and
was
not
impressed
im
much
more
impressed
with
this
batch
from
the
bottle
drink
i
always
have
the
hope
that
collaborations
turn
out
like
this
and
not
a
mess
this
was
well
put
together
and
big
nice
rounded
flavors
and
a
mix
of
things
worked
really
well
big
boozy
and
crisp
ill
really
need
another
bottle
to
hold
onto
for
a
year
overall
excellent
beer
a
little
sweet
but
overall
a
very
good
flavor
i
will
probably
try
to
pick
up
anther
bottle
or
two
to
age
primo
brau
poured
with
a
mammoth
tan
foamy
frothy
sudsy
head
that
lasts
forever
and
a
little
lace
color
is
a
clear
i
think
very
dark
garnet
aroma
is
massively
malty
toffee
roast
caramel
graham
a
little
fruit
and
a
hint
of
hop
flavor
is
much
the
same
but
the
different
characteristics
flit
in
and
out
of
presence
at
varying
rates
times
dry
sweet
bitter
and
always
with
a
little
tang
super
interesting
great
mouth
and
carbonation
finish
is
like
flavor
and
actually
fades
with
a
little
astringency
over
a
vague
time
slight
tweak
of
alcohol
would
be
easy
to
be
a
session
but
i
might
get
a
little
trashed
bravo
brewmasters
its
a
sweet
beer
because
of
the
delicious
very
real
tasting
maple
syrup
but
balanced
so
nicely
with
that
signature
sierra
nevada
hopping
this
is
really
almost
a
perfect
beer
in
my
mind
its
so
good
on
every
level
mouthfeeloverall
body
is
pretty
thin
for
the
abv
and
carbonation
is
moderate
not
terrible
but
again
the
alcohol
retracts
from
the
feel
overall
wanted
to
like
it
and
the
base
flavors
are
decent
but
way
too
much
alcohol
not
terribly
impressed
unfortunately
i
bought
two
bottles
of
this
one
im
reviewing
today
the
other
im
cellering
for
a
future
date
i
wonder
how
it
will
change
as
it
stands
a
great
find
from
sierra
nevada
and
dogfish
o
i
guess
the
build
up
for
this
beer
left
me
disappointed
i
enjoyed
this
quite
a
bit
and
would
order
it
on
draft
if
i
ran
into
it
but
was
ready
to
be
blown
away
by
it
i
was
actually
attempting
to
put
a
bit
of
age
on
this
until
i
encounterd
a
post
in
the
forums
about
bottles
exploding
that
included
a
comment
from
the
owner
of
my
store
saying
he
had
a
few
bottles
let
go
out
of
the
same
case
that
i
purchased
from
overall
a
nice
beer
i
had
a
bottle
of
the
first
batch
last
year
at
the
dogfish
brewpub
i
seem
to
remember
being
even
more
impressed
by
that
version
overall
very
enjoyable
big
with
abv
well
hidden
overall
fairly
decent
despite
not
having
as
much
maple
zing
as
i
expected
better
when
warmed
d
a
nice
beer
worth
the
money
not
so
much
but
i
am
glad
i
tried
it
overall
very
good
beer
and
ill
have
to
get
a
couple
more
to
age
them
i
really
enjoyed
the
maple
aroma
probably
the
first
beer
ive
had
that
actually
smelled
like
maple
life
limb
is
a
lively
dim
reddish
brown
ale
with
a
dense
waxy
khaki
head
that
has
outstanding
retention
and
lacing
it
has
a
sweet
grainy
aroma
with
notes
of
chocolate
canned
fruit
and
spice
its
very
full
bodied
and
syrupy
with
a
sticky
finish
its
a
touch
sweet
and
pretty
hot
and
boozy
its
fruity
with
a
hint
of
cherry
and
dates
a
grassy
herbal
bitterness
comes
out
at
the
finish
to
clean
things
up
a
little
the
flavor
of
dark
chocolate
and
black
pepper
linger
for
a
while
along
with
alcohol
heat
this
is
a
sipper
to
be
sure
overall
its
a
good
beer
its
something
fun
to
try
but
i
cant
quite
say
if
its
something
ill
buy
again
in
the
near
future
if
its
still
available
i
just
think
i
prefer
hair
of
the
dogs
adam
over
this
one
on
tap
at
the
sugar
maple
listed
as
10
5
abv
big
bitterness
thats
pleasant
enough
not
much
else
going
on
for
me
no
aroma
average
mouthfeel
chocolate
maltsa
little
toast
and
mollasses
darker
brown
colour
some
head
a
bit
boozy
alcohol
warming
notes
interesting
beer
with
a
lot
of
woody
flavors
pretty
sweet
but
not
overly
cloying
the
alcohol
was
a
little
strong
and
it
was
a
little
much
but
not
bad
definitely
improved
as
it
warmed
i
enjoyed
the
beer
but
it
wasnt
something
i
would
regularly
go
for
or
drink
a
lot
of
an
interesting
beer
not
sure
how
much
the
syrups
come
through
i
mostly
just
got
a
woodiness
that
was
quite
pleasant
glad
to
try
not
sure
if
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
try
and
find
again
a
bit
cloying
but
an
overall
complex
and
delicious
after
dinner
sipper
life
limb
2
is
a
delicious
afterdinner
or
latenight
sipper
that
nonbeer
drinkers
would
enjoy
however
the
sweetness
makes
it
best
enjoyed
in
small
doses
the
bomber
should
be
shared
overall
i
expected
a
bit
more
from
a
collaboration
of
this
magnitude
perhaps
i
opened
this
one
a
bit
early
as
it
seems
like
aging
is
quite
popular
with
it
as
of
now
though
nothing
extremely
exciting
for
me
had
this
on
tap
good
aromas
and
very
dark
in
collrs
great
tan
head
about
two
and
half
fingers
with
excellent
retention
the
taste
is
how
a
strong
ale
should
be
choclate
aftertaste
with
a
little
but
of
a
spice
note
aftertaste
overall
this
a
pretty
good
beer
worth
trying
especially
if
you
enjoy
dark
ales
with
big
body
and
pack
a
little
punch
o
overall
this
is
a
really
tasty
offering
that
should
be
shared
with
friends
looking
forward
to
see
what
a
little
age
does
for
this
one
m
medium
body
light
to
moderate
carbonation
this
years
vintage
isnt
terrible
but
its
too
sweet
for
mass
consumption
46
ounces
would
be
plenty
i
had
a
bottle
last
year
with
some
age
on
it
that
seems
to
be
the
way
to
go
at
10
for
750
ml
definitely
worth
the
money
o
this
has
good
drinkability
it
goes
down
easy
and
the
flavor
is
really
good
the
maple
syrup
flavors
here
really
add
a
nice
touch
and
the
amount
of
hop
presence
is
perfect
overall
i
really
enjoyed
with
beer
and
i
definitely
recommend
trying
it
i
would
buy
it
again
o
not
impressed
and
am
going
to
hold
onto
my
other
two
bottles
for
at
least
23
and
5
years
but
i
am
a
little
afraid
that
it
wont
hold
up
well
because
of
the
perceived
thinness
a
disappointment
although
not
bad
by
any
stretch
i
would
take
any
of
the
previous
sn
collaboration
beers
ahead
of
this
one
though
overall
intense
flavors
really
make
this
a
big
drink
not
a
chugger
for
sure
sip
and
enjoy
the
flavors
not
something
to
drink
all
the
time
this
22
ozer
is
more
then
enough
a
special
occassion
share
with
friends
let
it
warm
up
some
to
really
get
everything
out
of
the
flavors
it
has
batch
2
deep
deep
brown
almost
black
thick
off
tan
head
some
speckles
a
few
sheets
special
no
but
nice
looking
much
of
the
aroma
is
derived
from
dark
malts
some
maple
and
alcohol
aroma
is
detectable
little
bito
vanilla
a
rich
malty
flavor
rich
more
vanilla
rum
and
maple
like
flavors
then
anything
somewhat
one
dimensional
pretty
thin
for
the
style
and
finishes
a
tad
bitter
i
remember
liking
this
more
oh
well
its
still
pretty
good
its
a
sipper
but
damn
delicious
at
first
by
the
end
of
the
bottle
i
was
wishing
i
had
split
it
with
someone
im
really
glad
that
i
tried
it
though
good
collaboration
between
two
of
my
favorite
breweries
interesting
maple
and
birch
i
think
came
across
as
woody
elements
definitely
a
sweet
overall
beer
and
the
syrupy
feel
is
almost
too
much
i
only
hope
my
other
bottle
survives
aging
so
i
can
try
it
again
because
i
see
a
nice
potential
ps
this
is
an
amazing
beer
o
i
can
really
enjoy
this
i
have
a
weak
spot
for
strong
ales
and
this
definitely
did
not
disappoint
there
is
some
extra
residual
sweetness
that
i
am
sure
will
come
down
if
my
bottle
does
not
explode
and
it
may
calm
down
a
bit
in
terms
of
the
hops
which
are
kept
extremely
mellow
from
the
sweetness
of
the
sugar
in
this
brew
but
overall
i
could
definitely
say
i
would
drink
it
again
overall
this
was
a
pretty
good
brew
as
expected
from
a
dogfishsn
collaboration
not
my
favorite
style
but
in
this
case
that
isnt
necessarily
a
bad
thing
i
enjoyed
it
and
would
not
mind
trying
it
again
perhaps
at
a
little
warmer
temperature
to
see
if
other
flavors
begin
to
shine
through
a
solid
beer
by
solid
brewers
o
a
decent
beer
nothing
special
i
think
it
is
a
must
try
because
it
is
so
different
could
be
awesome
could
be
bad
but
give
it
a
shot
will
probably
be
a
lot
better
with
some
age
to
tame
the
alcohol
a
very
nice
and
drinkable
beer
which
speaks
of
experienced
brewing
from
both
breweries
great
job
overall
an
interesting
brew
not
my
cup
of
tea
but
i
enjoyed
my
small
pour
o
this
didnt
quite
meet
my
expectations
and
was
lousy
for
the
price
but
it
isnt
totally
repulsive
if
youre
offered
a
free
portion
try
for
yourself
overall
a
very
good
collabortation
from
dfh
and
sierra
i
love
both
of
those
breweries
and
they
made
one
hell
of
a
beer
i
wouldve
enjoyed
it
a
little
less
sweet
a
little
less
sticky
it
was
definitely
more
toward
the
stout
end
of
the
ale
spectrum
than
i
expected
im
not
saying
i
wouldnt
recommend
it
because
that
would
be
unfair
to
the
beer
but
if
there
is
such
a
thing
as
a
maple
stout
then
this
mightve
been
it
o
this
does
not
make
me
happy
does
not
make
me
want
more
reminds
me
of
a
ris
i
did
a
couple
years
ago
the
fermentation
happened
in
the
80s
and
the
beer
took
8
months
to
taste
right
kinda
feel
like
that
is
where
this
one
lands
making
it
very
sub
par
boozy
maple
syrup
concoction
pours
cola
brown
plenty
of
initial
head
nose
is
boozy
caramel
palate
offers
a
very
boozy
maple
flavored
spirit
ahem
beer
some
hops
herbs
but
overall
a
maple
liqeur
like
liquid
in
this
glass
tough
to
drink
good
for
them
that
drinkability
was
axed
as
a
criterion
awesome
a
must
try
one
of
a
kind
taste
no
head
retention
to
big
of
a
beer
for
that
good
smell
taste
how
do
i
explane
oh
i
know
mmm
not
much
of
a
burn
for
10
finishes
smooth
and
hum
oh
yeah
kinda
like
mmm
o
a
very
tasty
beer
i
would
be
happy
to
have
another
but
it
would
surely
knock
me
out
will
have
to
grab
another
bottle
at
the
store
and
cellar
it
for
a
while
would
be
great
this
winter
with
all
that
said
drink
this
fresh
in
my
opinion
as
my
experience
has
been
the
maple
fades
out
a
lot
and
if
that
is
your
favorite
part
of
it
as
it
was
for
me
enjoy
it
now
in
my
humble
opinion
overall
really
tasty
especially
if
your
in
the
mood
for
something
sweet
do
drinkability
is
moderate
i
have
to
say
this
beer
really
grew
on
me
at
first
the
waves
of
flavors
encapsulated
within
this
beer
is
somewhat
difficult
to
sift
through
but
as
it
warms
each
individual
aspect
comes
into
its
own
and
claims
for
itself
a
piece
of
the
beer
when
viewed
comprehensively
afterward
the
resulting
flavor
profile
is
enjoyable
if
not
a
bit
sporadic
poured
black
with
a
thick
tan
head
aromas
of
chocolate
cocoa
and
an
almost
cola
like
syrup
the
flavor
was
a
blend
of
maple
syrup
caramel
and
a
light
yeasty
finish
it
was
very
light
bodied
and
the
alcohol
was
very
well
hideen
overall
it
was
a
decent
beer
and
wasnt
overpriced
o
this
is
a
good
brew
alcohol
burn
overtakes
the
brew
a
bit
nice
depth
and
is
definitely
better
as
it
warms
up
pours
a
dark
tannish
brown
lots
of
nice
tan
head
smells
rusty
and
malty
some
nice
roast
on
the
nose
and
some
syrupy
sweetness
on
the
tongue
oxidized
but
still
tasty
smooth
and
rich
mouthfeel
a
bit
bitter
however
which
hurts
it
overall
still
enjoyable
but
not
stelllar
o
there
are
some
characteristics
i
can
appreciate
about
the
beer
but
the
taste
just
wasnt
there
for
me
the
nose
enticed
but
in
the
in
the
end
i
walked
away
unsatisfied
by
this
one
o
tastes
like
a
high
octane
brown
ale
with
a
dry
earthy
bitterness
i
dont
feel
the
maple
and
birch
syrups
made
their
presence
known
enough
or
maybe
they
just
came
through
as
molasses
overall
this
beer
hides
the
alcohol
fairly
well
the
appearance
and
mouthfeel
are
impressive
would
have
worked
better
without
the
earthy
hop
bitterness
overall
it
is
complex
and
a
solid
american
strong
ale
o
overal
very
interesting
great
mouthfeel
the
flavor
is
interesting
and
complex
and
it
would
be
a
hell
of
a
beer
to
have
with
some
dark
chocolate
or
a
cigar
overall
nice
to
have
tried
but
not
my
thing
cheers
pours
a
dark
mahogany
opaque
and
sludgy
dense
tan
head
that
quickly
fades
to
a
thin
collar
with
thick
sheets
of
lacing
aroma
is
sweet
maple
and
boozy
with
light
oak
fairly
mild
all
things
considered
thick
body
very
chewy
and
viscous
with
light
carbonation
flavor
is
smoother
and
more
balanced
than
i
remember
batch
1
being
but
its
still
a
chore
to
get
through
a
glass
maple
and
oak
dominate
with
charred
wood
ash
light
anise
chocolate
and
earthy
hops
very
boozy
but
not
as
solventy
and
depressing
as
batch
1
better
but
still
a
novelty
overalli
have
a
feeling
this
one
will
really
beautify
with
age
i
am
glad
i
managed
to
get
a
handful
of
bottles
othis
was
a
really
good
beer
but
it
is
a
bit
unbalanced
right
now
while
i
love
the
maple
syrup
sweetness
the
alcohol
is
still
a
bit
hot
i
have
an
extra
bottle
that
i
want
to
age
im
hoping
that
will
mellow
and
balance
this
beer
out
to
make
it
a
new
perfect
brew
enjoyable
but
not
quite
amazing
overall
this
is
an
excellent
beer
it
is
nice
and
dark
with
a
balance
of
roasted
malts
some
hops
and
sweetness
of
maple
syrup
to
add
to
the
complexity
while
there
is
some
alcohol
heat
it
works
well
with
this
particular
beer
o
ive
had
a
bottle
of
the
original
release
ive
been
debating
opening
so
it
was
nice
to
try
it
beer
was
what
ive
heard
and
expected
but
i
personally
enjoy
it
ill
enjoy
another
for
me
this
is
too
much
dessert
to
begin
with
and
too
abrasive
for
a
dessert
beer
even
if
i
wanted
one
maybe
a
few
years
of
age
will
transform
this
beer
i
hope
so
because
it
needs
to
be
transformed
to
be
worth
drinking
again
a
delicious
and
interesting
release
im
glad
i
still
have
one
remaining
though
it
seems
to
lack
complexity
and
remains
somewhat
simple
throughout
oi
had
not
had
the
chance
to
try
the
first
batch
of
this
so
i
was
excited
to
try
this
one
even
though
im
not
a
big
fan
of
maple
syrup
in
beer
but
this
one
works
on
every
level
a
very
nice
collaboration
from
two
great
breweries
if
this
ever
gets
released
again
ill
pick
up
some
more
without
hesitation
o
tasty
fairly
drinkable
for
the
style
serving
type
bottle
o
i
didnt
know
what
to
expect
from
a
beer
in
this
very
general
category
life
limb
is
a
great
beer
in
small
doses
this
was
a
10oz
pour
that
seemed
like
more
than
enough
i
would
never
try
to
drink
a
750
of
this
myself
a
very
good
collaboration
im
sure
to
buy
a
bottle
pours
an
earthy
brown
with
a
large
deep
tan
head
has
a
very
earthy
woody
scent
taste
is
maple
syrup
and
great
roasted
malts
with
some
almost
chared
oak
notes
mouthfeel
is
great
but
i
feel
like
carbonation
is
super
high
on
this
one
overall
good
beer
i
would
love
to
see
what
this
turns
into
with
some
age
on
it
o
this
was
my
first
shot
at
this
beer
and
i
really
enjoyed
it
totally
solid
big
beer
between
two
great
breweries
highly
recommended
o
good
beer
to
start
a
long
day
stuck
inside
watching
the
hurricane
blow
things
around
pretty
smooth
despite
the
booziness
probably
could
stand
to
age
a
bit
to
smooth
things
out
more
though
o
not
the
most
complex
beer
but
a
nicely
done
collaboration
between
two
of
the
more
popular
breweries
this
is
a
good
sipping
beer
because
of
the
abv
and
one
that
will
fit
better
towards
the
winter
months
definitely
pick
a
few
up
and
lay
some
down
the
taste
as
my
wife
would
say
is
like
candy
sweet
malt
start
and
carbonation
fills
the
mouth
the
taste
of
the
malts
dry
and
leave
a
belgian
yeast
at
the
end
wow
what
a
brew
very
flavorful
and
well
bodied
a
great
brew
to
savor
and
i
would
love
to
age
a
few
for
the
future
great
collaboration
between
dfh
and
sn
excellent
stuff
here
overall
though
this
is
kind
of
boring
to
me
i
am
not
even
getting
a
sense
of
the
syrup
in
taste
and
smell
it
comes
out
a
little
more
as
the
brew
gets
room
temperature
but
not
by
much
fairly
average
if
you
ask
me
but
is
still
easily
drinkable
but
feels
like
a
regular
run
of
the
mill
barleywine
or
strong
ale
or
perhaps
a
sub
par
one
cheers
o
a
really
big
beer
the
flavors
mesh
well
and
keeps
you
looking
forward
to
each
sip
so
you
can
continue
to
enjoy
all
the
complexity
this
beer
has
to
offer
first
time
ever
having
the
opportunity
of
drinking
this
one
poured
from
a
22
oz
bomber
into
a
pint
glass
pours
dark
hue
of
brown
with
a
very
generous
2
fingers
width
head
im
about
half
way
done
with
the
pint
and
the
head
hasnt
dissipated
much
at
all
lots
of
residual
lacing
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
smell
is
very
malty
lots
of
carmel
taste
is
wonderful
caramel
vanilla
and
a
touch
of
toffee
mouthfeel
is
very
stoutesque
thick
full
awesome
im
glad
i
finally
got
around
to
this
one
overall
an
interesting
beer
i
have
one
bottle
of
the
original
batch
i
never
drank
im
curious
to
do
a
side
by
side
tasting
of
that
batch
with
this
batch
one
day
for
so
fresh
very
little
alcohol
tastewarmth
a
good
beer
to
enjoy
on
a
cooler
almost
fall
night
in
illinois
a
pretty
good
beer
overall
i
enjoyed
drinking
this
and
it
delivers
to
a
certain
extent
within
the
style
sweet
and
sticky
some
heat
some
contrasting
elements
that
being
said
its
a
bit
muddled
and
not
terribly
complex
i
think
theres
only
so
much
maple
and
birch
syrup
can
add
to
a
beer
so
i
probably
wont
actively
seek
it
out
again
id
love
to
try
the
ba
version
though
since
i
think
the
base
would
do
well
in
a
barrel
d
this
was
a
decent
beer
but
honestly
not
delicious
the
scent
and
taste
were
kind
of
messy
and
hot
and
the
body
was
a
bit
over
carbonated
so
it
wasnt
super
easy
to
drink
seemed
like
it
was
intended
to
be
aged
not
worth
seeking
out
fresh
the
use
of
maple
here
is
impressive
dont
see
this
in
a
big
batch
beer
all
that
often
good
stuff
just
a
tad
too
strong
which
causes
some
medicinal
and
alcohol
hints
oa
i
like
it
needs
to
be
aged
a
bit
so
we
will
review
it
again
in
a
year
or
so
o
nice
but
does
not
live
up
to
the
hype
though
a
very
good
brew
i
had
the
1st
batch
albeit
with
more
age
on
it
and
i
think
that
was
much
much
better
aged
batch
2
poured
from
a
bomber
i
poured
the
beer
into
a
schooner
and
it
presents
with
a
huge
pop
when
you
pull
the
cork
the
beer
has
a
tremendously
dense
and
thick
foam
on
the
pour
light
tan
in
color
and
very
frothy
almost
milkshake
consistency
it
settles
extremely
slowly
this
massive
collection
of
foam
is
resting
upon
a
nearblack
opaque
and
thick
looking
brew
no
signs
of
carbonation
in
the
glass
or
on
the
pour
you
have
to
break
up
the
conglomerate
of
head
to
get
your
nose
in
there
but
once
you
do
there
is
a
blend
of
sugary
sweet
flavors
dark
and
rich
malt
and
a
boozey
highlight
the
beers
flavors
are
dark
and
rich
with
a
molasses
type
foundation
taste
that
springs
some
woody
and
smokey
notes
the
syrups
are
not
overpowering
but
the
subtle
sweetness
and
tang
does
come
through
as
the
beer
further
warms
and
settles
very
smooth
and
creamy
mouthfeel
and
there
is
a
thick
solid
lacing
along
the
glass
again
almost
like
drinking
a
milkshake
the
beer
has
a
sugary
sweet
and
roastedtoasted
aftertaste
leaving
a
slight
smokey
flavor
on
the
palate
the
booze
helps
to
keep
the
aftertaste
quick
and
light
with
a
slick
and
fast
finish
definitely
warms
as
you
drink
and
will
be
fantastic
once
wintertime
rolls
around
very
tasty
o
not
amazingly
impressed
with
this
which
is
a
shame
since
ive
been
wanting
to
try
this
beer
ever
since
i
missed
the
first
batch
its
a
good
beer
but
the
flavor
and
aroma
just
doesnt
stand
out
i
have
two
more
bottles
so
im
interested
in
seeing
how
this
beer
evolves
over
time
i
feel
like
this
should
be
sold
in
4
packs
rather
than
750s
o
very
meh
its
got
a
lot
of
unique
flavors
but
im
not
sure
theyre
actually
enjoyable
i
feel
like
maple
and
birch
need
a
sweeter
beer
and
im
not
sure
what
is
giving
it
such
a
gross
medicinal
bitterness
but
it
doesnt
help
at
all
glad
i
bought
this
but
next
time
ill
save
it
for
cold
weather
and
a
share
it
with
a
loved
one
who
has
a
sweet
tooth
thanks
to
the
esteemed
bardwashrind
for
providing
me
with
this
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
lots
of
tan
head
on
the
nose
and
palate
there
is
lots
of
sweet
caramel
dark
fruit
and
the
birch
syrup
which
is
cloying
in
more
than
extremely
small
quantities
6
ounces
of
this
beer
is
enough
body
is
on
the
thicker
side
with
medium
carbonation
overall
an
interesting
beer
but
i
dont
get
why
this
is
only
sold
in
750
ml
bottles
because
its
a
special
release
to
make
more
money
why
not
sell
this
in
a
regular
12
ounce
bottle
given
the
high
abv
and
lack
of
drinkability
ugh
the
unnecessary
oversized
bottles
are
getting
old
overall
i
think
this
is
a
solid
beer
from
dfh
and
sn
i
loved
it
and
i
will
buy
it
again
delicious
on
tap
i
cant
wait
to
try
it
in
bottle
a
beer
well
done
wow
i
will
pick
this
up
again
for
sure
i
didnt
rate
this
at
the
highest
point
because
i
have
only
tried
a
few
strong
ales
and
a
few
barleywines
so
this
was
great
compared
to
the
style
i
have
tasted
so
far
i
have
had
double
bastard
but
this
is
more
towards
the
style
i
think
should
be
tried
more
thumbs
up
to
dfh
and
sn
nailed
it
definitely
worth
a
try
and
kudos
to
dogfish
and
sn
for
coming
up
with
this
unique
ale
overall
boozy
and
dark
in
flavor
not
as
complex
as
i
remember
it
from
the
first
version
but
its
definitely
worth
seeking
out
and
trying
cheers
glad
i
was
able
to
find
this
on
tap
btw
its
on
tap
at
finnegans
in
plainfield
il
for
anyone
local
pours
a
nice
dark
brown
aroma
is
maple
birch
and
booze
the
flavor
and
body
was
where
the
beer
started
to
go
wrong
for
me
the
maplebirch
sweetness
dominates
to
the
point
of
being
cloying
considering
this
is
a
sierra
nevada
product
i
was
expecting
some
hop
counterbalance
but
theres
almost
none
the
finish
at
least
is
a
bit
dry
owing
largely
to
the
high
abv
this
might
be
better
and
more
balanced
after
36
months
or
more
of
ageing
the
woodaged
version
sounds
good
as
it
might
add
some
bite
although
this
did
seem
to
have
a
trace
of
woodsiness
along
with
the
syrupsap
of
the
trees
this
was
disappointing
especially
considering
the
pedigree
of
the
brewery
malty
american
barleywine
with
deep
sweetness
with
hint
of
cherry
raisins
and
a
warming
alcohol
finish
this
tastes
more
like
a
stong
sweet
belgian
brown
ale
than
an
american
barleywine
one
might
expect
some
burn
carmel
and
bitter
resin
since
this
appears
at
first
to
be
a
malty
american
barleywine
but
it
is
extremely
well
balanced
and
the
sweetness
dominates
along
with
boozy
warming
alcohol
finish
excellent
pours
an
almost
black
body
w
great
head
that
dies
slow
and
leaves
a
lace
ring
a
mixed
aroma
as
i
pick
up
something
close
to
that
belgian
yeast
w
sugar
and
orangecitric
notes
and
im
alsom
picking
up
dry
roasted
malts
as
well
as
somthing
close
to
coffee
or
figs
real
smooth
almost
creamy
w
great
carbonation
so
it
mixes
in
some
crispness
and
avoids
being
too
slick
i
have
to
sip
on
it
as
this
is
also
strong
tasting
at
the
same
time
roasted
and
dry
malts
blend
w
a
sticky
breadywoody
sweetness
like
caramel
and
maple
are
in
there
possibly
even
burnt
chocolate
all
these
malts
work
together
and
still
balance
with
some
lowkey
herbal
hops
for
a
dry
somewhat
bitter
finish
this
is
a
quality
ale
that
mixes
sweetness
w
heaviness
and
adds
a
touch
of
fruitiness
to
it
and
finishes
crisp
and
dry
a
superb
ale
o
opens
with
a
pop
lots
of
layers
here
this
is
not
mind
blowing
in
any
way
but
it
is
an
absolute
enjoyable
beer
that
has
a
pretty
unique
taste
i
dont
think
its
worth
going
crazy
over
to
find
but
if
you
see
it
its
really
worth
trying
excellent
brew
and
would
try
again
overall
i
would
rate
this
beer
a
b
never
had
the
first
iteration
of
this
beer
but
i
like
v2
looking
forward
to
see
what
happens
to
a
bottle
of
this
with
a
year
of
cellaring
on
it
enjoyed
this
a
lot
opened
it
early
due
to
claims
of
exploding
bottles
hopefully
i
can
get
another
and
sit
on
it
a
little
thinner
in
the
mouthfeel
than
i
would
have
expected
only
a
slight
notice
of
the
alcohol
excellent
brew
overall
that
i
would
gladly
have
again
o
overall
a
pretty
complex
beer
as
it
warms
it
gives
off
a
different
flavor
profile
smooth
and
creamy
mouthfeel
with
a
sweet
aftertaste
that
seems
to
linger
hardley
notice
the
high
abv
not
a
bad
beer
glad
i
had
a
chance
to
try
it
might
get
another
one
to
see
how
it
ages
cheers
o
sierra
nevada
and
dogfish
heads
life
limb
vol
2
is
a
fine
example
of
what
a
collaboration
beer
should
be
theres
not
always
a
need
to
go
crazy
just
do
all
of
the
little
things
right
and
the
beer
will
prosper
this
brew
drinks
like
a
dream
and
one
that
could
evolve
into
something
really
special
in
a
proper
cellar
a
quite
tasty
beer
but
perhaps
i
had
built
my
expectations
up
a
bit
much
as
in
the
end
the
beer
seemed
to
fall
short
of
its
potential
deep
chestnut
brown
verging
on
black
roasted
malt
notes
with
some
caramel
sweetness
but
a
drying
note
helped
moderate
the
sweetness
background
note
of
maple
syrup
married
to
a
resinous
woody
flavor
that
vagely
called
to
mind
the
more
pineyinfluenced
anchor
our
special
ale
editions
while
there
was
some
nice
layering
of
flavors
overall
the
beer
seemed
to
lack
some
needed
punch
particulary
for
such
a
big
beer
and
abv
i
may
put
one
of
these
back
for
a
while
just
to
see
what
it
does
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
and
hope
they
make
it
every
year
from
now
on
drinkability
this
is
an
interesting
beer
it
is
quite
enjoyable
but
to
be
honest
i
expected
a
little
more
from
these
two
craft
giants
its
good
very
good
in
fact
but
its
not
great
i
would
love
to
see
how
this
would
turn
out
after
some
time
in
the
cellar
interesting
beer
ill
probably
throw
a
few
in
the
cellar
to
see
what
happens
as
it
is
at
the
moment
though
id
call
it
good
not
great
i
think
the
primary
draw
is
the
maple
which
i
would
like
to
see
in
more
beers
from
the
woodsy
syrups
added
to
the
roasted
malts
and
the
earthy
hops
this
brew
seriously
smells
and
tastes
like
a
tree
in
the
best
way
possible
the
sturdiness
of
the
palate
further
emphasizes
that
vibe
i
do
agree
with
some
of
the
other
bas
here
who
maybe
expected
to
be
wowed
a
little
more
but
the
absolutely
perfect
balance
on
the
palate
makes
me
think
that
this
will
age
beautifully
for
at
least
10
years
ive
got
another
in
the
cellar
and
hope
to
come
back
with
an
update
this
is
a
complex
but
intriguing
brew
if
you
take
the
time
to
appreciate
it
a
very
good
beer
o
overall
very
good
its
always
nice
to
see
a
collaboration
between
two
big
breweries
this
one
fortunately
turned
out
quite
tasty
overall
boozy
but
mild
not
the
greatest
combination
however
it
tastes
quite
good
and
is
a
nice
sipper
glad
i
tried
but
probably
not
worth
it
o
overall
i
am
disappointed
i
was
very
excited
to
try
this
so
i
opened
my
750ml
bottle
soon
after
i
bought
it
maybe
some
time
would
add
some
depth
and
soften
the
finish
im
not
intrigued
enough
to
spend
another
12
to
find
out
though
o
not
a
good
looking
beer
by
any
means
but
it
sure
had
some
great
flavors
and
decent
aromas
im
satisfied
with
having
it
once
on
tap
i
probably
will
not
seek
out
a
bottle
of
this
pretty
good
tastes
similar
to
some
oak
ages
stouts
to
me
id
have
it
again
and
the
price
is
right
for
something
that
has
dogfish
head
on
it
d
i
was
worried
that
this
would
be
too
younga
big
sweet
booze
bomb
however
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
great
complexity
on
the
palate
i
think
this
could
be
put
away
to
age
but
it
is
a
fine
drinker
right
now
bomber
of
batch
2
pours
a
super
dark
chestnuty
brownblack
color
with
a
huge
creamy
tan
head
tons
of
lacing
aroma
is
earthy
and
boozey
definitely
can
smell
some
of
the
maple
syrup
smells
somewhat
nutty
taste
is
creamy
with
maple
syrup
and
nuts
flavor
is
sweet
with
hints
of
vanilla
sweet
syrup
at
the
end
with
the
creamy
mouthfeel
this
beer
is
kind
of
like
a
maple
syrup
milkshake
the
good
amount
of
alcohol
flavor
and
the
sweetness
slows
down
the
drinking
time
overall
its
a
decent
beer
but
not
something
i
would
buy
all
the
time
perfect
for
the
colder
months
glad
i
tried
it
and
i
am
interested
in
aging
one
a
must
have
a
nice
stong
beer
and
well
done
o
great
overall
beer
to
sip
on
for
an
extended
period
i
cant
place
my
finger
on
this
one
its
strong
its
an
ale
and
made
in
america
if
i
would
guess
the
style
they
were
going
after
it
would
be
an
imperial
brown
ale
with
some
english
appeal
from
the
malts
chosen
not
a
total
mess
and
may
benifit
from
a
short
stay
in
the
cellar
im
all
for
innovation
and
this
is
not
the
norm
draft
to
snifter
appearance
is
good
deep
borderline
porter
smell
is
its
weakest
attribute
malt
and
alcohol
are
present
but
it
could
be
more
robust
taste
is
good
malty
with
an
alcohol
presence
that
gives
it
a
mild
bourbon
flavor
mouthfeel
was
good
too
nothing
memorable
but
when
its
a
10
beer
thats
not
a
bad
thing
overall
a
tasty
beer
honestly
it
might
have
scored
even
better
had
i
not
known
it
was
a
collaboration
between
two
powerhouses
and
my
expectations
werent
already
uberhigh
this
is
a
sipping
beer
which
would
work
well
with
cigars
or
with
a
strong
lamb
stew
basically
anything
strong
enough
hold
its
own
while
drinking
this
overall
i
enjoyed
this
but
its
a
bit
challenging
due
to
the
sweetness
i
may
age
one
for
a
good
long
time
apart
from
anything
its
great
to
see
dogfish
and
sierra
nevada
come
together
for
this
beer
above
anything
i
appreciate
the
clear
comradeship
that
went
into
this
overall
this
is
a
disappointment
a
expensive
and
alcoholic
milk
stout
very
full
pint
from
a
bomber
no
meaningful
aroma
nearlyopaque
dark
rich
slightly
brown
through

thick

no
significant

flavors
of

birch
if
you
search
hard
for
it
good
maltyness
minor
alcohol
notes
well
balanced
for
a
10
beer
not
heavy
in
the
mouthfeel
which
is
impressive
but
overall
not
as
tasty
as
the
description
left
me
hopeful
for
750
ml
caged
and
corked
bottle
release
2
date
stamp
on
bottle
shows
that
this
was
bottled
on
june
28th
2011
i
missed
out
on
this
brew
during
the
first
release
so
im
happy
that
this
was
made
again
served
in
a
dfh
signature
glass
the
beer
pours
dark
brown
with
a
couple
inch
tan
head
the
head
retention
is
excellent
and
theres
also
a
good
amount
of
lacing
aroma
is
sweet
and
malty
it
smells
like
maple
caramel
malt
molasses
raisins
and
some
chocolate
it
tastes
like
maple
molasses
wood
raisins
chocolate
smoke
and
a
bit
of
booze
mouthfeelbody
is
mediumfull
its
creamy
smooth
and
is
well
carbonated
i
think
this
is
a
pretty
good
overall
brew
i
liked
it
a
lot
it
was
a
shame
how
few
beer
snobs
were
able
to
try
the
first
batch
so
im
so
happy
they
decided
to
make
a
second
im
going
to
age
the
smoked
pork
im
eating
besides
this
beer
for
5
years
too
on
second
thought
maybe
ill
just
age
the
beer
owell
it
was
a
very
unique
beer
it
wasnt
bad
but
not
great
either
it
was
complex
but
not
very
well
balanced
it
wasnt
hoppy
at
all
like
some
strong
ales
good
but
no
need
to
have
it
again
o
thanks
to
ctsparky
for
sharing
he
sat
on
this
bottle
for
a
year
and
i
think
the
aging
served
it
well
a
prefect
beer
for
those
who
like
a
bit
of
brandy
to
end
the
day
hmmm
im
not
blown
away
but
i
definitely
enjoy
this
one
kind
of
an
imperial
nut
brownold
ale
crossover
i
got
one
more
for
the
cellar
and
may
pick
up
another
bottle
or
two
before
it
disappears
overall
i
was
less
of
a
fan
of
this
one
compared
to
the
first
one
and
i
didnt
enjoy
the
first
one
very
much
it
was
just
kind
of
messy
not
something
id
buy
again
overall
its
definitely
going
in
the
cellar
for
a
while
im
curious
to
see
what
flavors
come
out
as
the
alcohol
starts
to
fade
its
good
now
but
i
have
a
feeling
itll
get
better
with
some
time
pours
a
super
dark
brown
with
a
hue
3
inch
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
1
inch
cap
the
carbonation
bubbles
are
quite
busy
moving
down
to
the
bottom
of
the
head
thick
foamy
rings
of
lace
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
toastedroasted
malt
brown
sugar
molasses
and
wood
aromas
taste
is
of
roasted
malt
very
stoutlike
in
flavor
burnt
sugar
molasses
and
a
dry
wood
flavor
the
wood
flavor
lingers
on
the
palate
after
each
sip
a
low
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
flat
and
thick
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
i
have
been
following
ever
since
i
heard
they
were
going
to
brew
it
again
a
good
beer
but
not
quite
what
i
was
expecting
here
this
is
one
complex
beer
the
alcohol
is
barely
restrained
on
the
back
end
the
middle
is
a
layered
mix
of
a
really
boozy
beer
bread
molasses
and
wood
maybe
some
fig
or
prune
im
betting
this
thing
could
age
for
five
years
a
beer
to
contemplate
quite
interesting
and
a
delicious
showcase
of
the
relative
breweries
ingredients
and
brewing
prowess
not
something
that
is
going
to
change
the
world
but
as
with
the
brews
in
sierra
nevadas
30th
anniversary
series
this
is
a
collaboration
that
will
most
certainly
go
down
in
history
im
not
sure
what
to
make
of
this
all
i
know
is
that
its
very
filling
o
wow
this
was
worth
the
wait
sam
and
ken
made
a
really
nice
and
unique
beer
definitely
will
be
stocking
up
cant
wait
to
see
what
it
is
like
with
a
little
age
light
to
medium
body
and
a
good
amount
of
soft
carbonation
that
helps
contribute
to
the
dry
feeling
on
the
tongue
a
little
lighter
in
body
than
i
would
like
alcohol
is
present
in
the
taste
and
in
warmth
felt
on
the
tongue
and
back
of
the
throat
as
you
swallow
had
tried
the
first
one
on
tap
after
it
saw
a
year
of
aging
and
i
liked
that
slightly
more
drinkability
a
sipper
to
say
the
least
yet
the
alcohol
isnt
too
prevalent
to
make
you
not
have
more
then
one
glass
this
beer
shows
great
complexity
from
two
brewers
who
have
so
much
to
offer
and
when
combined
can
make
such
a
well
crafted
gem
like
this
if
you
can
find
it
store
a
couple
bottles
and
age
them
to
see
even
more
complex
flavors
and
aromas
over
time
o
at
10

abv
life
limb

is
an
exceptional
brew
that
blends
the
roasted
earthy
qualities
of
a
smoked
porter
or
stout
with
the
fruity
bitterness
of
a
dipa
incredibly
smooth
complex
and
flavorful
im
glad
i
got
a
chance
to
try
it
ontap
so
i
can
leisurely
open
or
cellar
a
couple
bottles
i
managed
to
secure
edit
much
better
with
age
just
opened
my
2nd
and
last
bottle
about
2
weeks
ago
and
it
was
fantastic
age
this
beer
poured
a
dark
brown
color
almost
black
with
a
nice
frothy
tan
head
you
can
really
smell
the
alcohol
on
the
nose
coffee
chocolate
bourbon
vanilla
no
maple
syrup
though
must
have
fermented
out
to
me
this
is
a
coffee
stout
but
they
are
calling
it
a
strong
ale
i
will
defiantly
get
another
bottle
of
this
if
i
can
still
find
it
overall
this
is
just
as
tasty
as
i
remember
several
months
back
when
i
first
had
this
out
of
the
bottle
with
9
mo
of
age
on
it
it
is
drinking
great
now
but
is
a
little
woodyoaky
and
could
use
probably
6
months
to
balance
out
and
let
the
flavors
synergize
a
little
more
still
really
delicious
and
cant
recommend
enough
overall
a
very
good
strong
ale
and
is
definitely
worth
seeking
out
just
dont
expect
much
hops
this
one
pours
a
full
bodied
dark
dark
brown
with
a
one
finger
creamy
beige
head
that
turns
into
a
nice
lacing
around
the
glass
the
aromas
consist
of
creamy
and
soft
chocolate
light
wood
birch
i
suppose
and
some
light
and
sweet
maple
syrup
its
overly
malty
but
very
smooth
and
put
together
nicely
i
do
detect
some
alcohol
as
it
warms
but
it
isnt
anything
over
the
top
it
tastes
of
sweet
and
bitter
chocolates
maple
syrup
has
moderate
woodiness
some
toffee
and
finishes
smooth
it
is
sweet
but
subtly
so
it
drinks
really
smooth
and
creamy
i
didnt
expect
it
to
be
this
smooth
so
young
but
it
really
is
the
final
compliment
of
the
beer
you
dont
get
any
of
the
abv
and
its
a
nice
sipper
im
really
a
big
fan
of
this
one
ill
have
to
save
a
few
bottles
to
age
big
complex
well
balanced
theres
some
boozy
warmth
but
i
wouldnt
guess
it
is
10
delicious
black
with
a
brown
head
nice
look
to
it
like
a
real
cask
ale
smells
a
bit
boozey
but
rich
and
deep
its
an
interesting
smelling
beer
tastes
very
smooth
lightly
carbonated
and
theres
a
touch
of
alcohol
but
its
overpowered
by
caramel
hints
and
sweet
coffee
and
chocolate
notes
this
is
a
fullbodied
beer
but
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
weak
compared
to
the
rest
of
this
beers
qualities
overall
this
is
fantastica
nice
effort
by
two
good
breweries
o
lots
to
say
about
this
one
and
i
guess
that
is
a
good
thing
i
feel
strongly
that
nobody
does
brown
ales
like
dogfish
head
this
may
not
be
everyones
cup
of
tea
but
for
this
style
the
sierradogfish
collaboration
was
a
match
made
in
heaven
update
i
cracked
my
2nd
bottle
in
august
2012
after
letting
it
sit
for
1
year
the
age
did
a
lot
of
good
for
this
beer
imo
the
before
mentioned
unpleasant
licorice
disappeared
as
did
a
lot
of
the
spicy
hops
it
was
much
smoother
sweeter
and
enjoyable
than
the
first
bottle
i
had
fresh
the
flavors
melded
together
very
well
if
you
have
these
i
would
drink
them
at
about
a
year
to
18
months
t
brown
sugar
with
a
little
hint
of
chocolate
and
maple
syrup
a
slight
nuttiness
towards
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
creamy
like
a
nice
stout
very
smooth
on
the
palate
its
a
sipper
so
youll
definitely
take
some
to
time
to
enjoy
this
one
a
delicious
beer
that
has
a
lot
of
elements
going
on
for
it
overall
drinkability
makes
for
a
great
sipper
as
the
label
even
states
very
enjoyable
strong
beer
for
when
you
want
the
hoppiness
and
alcohol
of
an
ipa
with
the
maltiness
of
a
cream
stout
basically
an
imperial
esb
if
you
think
about
it
o
very
good
beer
but
not
excellentsubject
to
change
after
i
age
my
second
bottle
this
is
the
second
iteration
and
its
pretty
good
would
defiantly
recommend
and
as
many
suggest
age
d
really
nice
interesting
mash
of
flavors
but
it
all
totally
works
not
as
bad
as
i
was
expecting
it
to
be
after
i
heard
a
lot
of
talk
about
it
being
overly
sweet
it
is
quite
sweet
and
balancing
bitterness
is
barely
there
i
liked
how
maple
heavy
this
beer
ended
up
being
though
o
i
really
expected
more
from
this
one
it
is
a
good
beer
however
it
just
did
not
blow
me
away
as
i
had
expected
it
to
i
loved
this
one
the
cpj
i
enjoyed
this
more
as
it
warmed
many
flavors
going
on
here
with
smooth
mouthfeel
very
nice
pours
a
deep
brown
with
an
inch
of
creamy
dark
tan
head
aroma
is
lightly
nutty
with
a
sweet
hint
o
syrup
and
hops
mouthfeel
is
heavy
creamy
witha
finish
that
is
much
like
a
milkshake
taste
is
of
wood
syrup
hops
vanilla
honey
and
earth
creamy
rich
and
filling
overall
great
on
texture
and
feel
but
lacking
something
in
flavor
overall
i
am
enjoying
this
beer
but
i
would
not
jump
head
over
heels
to
drink
it
again
i
would
have
one
or
two
a
year
its
a
very
well
crafted
beer
but
it
tastes
very
similar
to
many
beers
in
different
styles
which
could
be
a
good
thing
d
struggled
hard
with
this
one
and
then
was
bailed
out
by
steve
no
thanks
on
this
one
again
d
decent
drinkability
overall
a
unique
brew
that
brings
out
some
interesting
flavors
a
tad
astringent
on
the
finish
bit
for
the
most
part
extremely
solid
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
large
off
white
khaki
colored
head
and
little
lacing
aroma
has
a
little
bit
of
everything
floral
hops
caramel
roasted
malt
citrus
in
the
flavor
quite
roasty
upfront
this
gives
way
to
the
hops
with
earthy
wood
notes
citrus
and
some
pine
caramel
malt
sweetness
is
there
to
balance
along
with
the
maple
there
are
big
flavors
of
pine
roast
and
caramel
all
throughout
this
beer
warming
alcohol
is
certainly
there
for
the
ride
but
somewhat
restrained
full
bodied
feel
decent
balance
for
a
beer
so
big
not
getting
a
whole
lot
of
maple
though
it
was
used
in
the
brewing
process
overall
a
nice
beer
kind
of
defies
most
styles
so
the
catch
all
american
strong
ale
is
appropriate
here
i
liked
it
quite
a
bit
hope
i
can
find
another
a
little
sweet
but
great
aroma
and
flavors
with
only
a
pleasant
warmth
from
the
higher
abv
would
definitely
like
to
pick
up
a
couple
more
bottles
poured
into
a
snifter
this
a
black
color
with
a
solid
an
inch
of
head
smell
is
sweet
with
some
hints
of
dark
chocolate
and
maple
taste
is
an
interesting
mix
of
smoky
wood
dark
chocolate
maple
syrup
and
molasses
extremely
sweet
the
alcohol
doesnt
bite
too
badly
at
first
but
it
catches
up
with
you
after
a
while
bottled
popped
with
a
lot
of
force
and
the
carbonation
showed
itself
when
i
poured
it
came
out
a
brown
body
with
a
large
amount
of
fluffy
offwhite
head
the
creamy
head
lasted
throughout
my
pint
and
stuck
to
my
upper
lip
nose
is
heavy
malt
toasted
grain
and
caramel
sweetness
also
some
piney
hops
and
plums
flavor
is
a
thick
malty
blast
of
caramel
and
burnt
molasses
the
same
dart
fruit
flavors
from
the
nose
and
then
some
hops
kick
in
giving
a
resinous
pine
feel
that
leans
towards
having
a
bitter
dry
finish
but
it
is
smoothed
out
by
the
large
malt
body
creamy
with
a
semidry
finish
and
little
trace
of
the
alcohol
satisfied
with
splitting
the
220z
o
good
brew
not
my
first
pick
but
wanted
to
try
it
this
is
my
first
experience
with
this
beer
and
im
pleasantly
surprised
flawed
sure
but
overall
a
really
tasty
brew

a
good

a

beer

along
with

i
read
a
lot
of
reviews
saying
that
they
dont
really
pick
up
the
maple
syrup
in
this
beer
but
i
really
get
a
lot
of
it
i
get
the
maple
syrup
with
dark
fruits
and
dark
chocolate
tons
or
roasted
and
caramel
malt
as
well
hints
of
booze
as
the
beer
warms
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
nice
carbonation
this
beer
had
the
potential
of
being
overly
syrupy
but
it
is
not
at
all
drinkability
is
high
overall
this
is
a
tasty
beer
i
had
this
the
first
time
it
was
released
and
was
not
very
into
craft
beer
so
i
guess
i
didnt
appreciate
it
for
what
it
was
this
beer
is
good
but
i
think
a
year
or
two
will
make
this
beer
great
dogfish
head
and
sierra
nevada
have
wildly
different
creative
approaches
to
their
respective
lines
of
beer
yet
life
limb
manages
to
interweave
them
nicely
its
a
tasty
display
of
teamwork
now
but
im
going
to
buy
a
bottle
to
stash
away
for
a
year
to
let
the
malt
flavors
and
carbonation
develop
i
really
like
this
beer
it
isnt
anything
life
changing
or
mind
blowing
but
it
is
very
solid
and
extremely
different
from
the
usual
now
if
only
it
were
priced
like
sierra
and
not
a
dogfish
beer
o
im
certainly
glad
i
had
this
fresh
so
that
ill
understand
what
it
does
in
a
year
or
two
when
i
open
the
next
one
more
coffee
than
expected
way
less
maple
syrup
than
i
was
hoping
for
not
sure
i
should
be
rating
this
as
well
as
i
have
i
like
the
aroma
smell
taste
feel
and
drinkability
it
just
didnt
seem
to
drink
as
advertised
it
doesnt
make
it
bad
just
not
what
i
expected
the
serving
was
a
750ml
bottle
the
glass
oversize
wine
glass
i
think
its
pretty
good
to
me
its
ridiculously
complex
its
like
a
bizarre
dark
barleywine
it
has
an
abv
of
10
2
percent
smells
malty
as
hell
hints
of
raisin
and
orange
on
the
nose
when
it
hits
the
tongue
its
like
chocolate
and
orange
immediately
you
get
the
malty
alcohol
kick
and
then
there
is
a
surprisingly
long
lingering
aftertaste
of
banana
in
the
background
but
i
mean
really
ripe
banana
overall
id
give
it
a
ba
not
my
favorite
for
a
sierra
nevada
but
pretty
damn
good
for
a
dogfish
head
othis
is
young
i
expect
it
will
be
better
in
a
few
months
and
excellent
in
a
few
years
o
this
is
a
very
delicious
beer
one
that
will
age
beautifully
its
a
little
sharp
and
thin
right
now
but
with
some
time
i
think
that
will
mellow
out
a
lot
overall
a
decent
beer
i
remember
wondering
what
all
the
hype
was
over
the
first
batch
its
ok
o
earths
juice
tapped
straight
from
mother
nature
itself
o
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
as
did
my
bottlesharing
friend
it
seems
to
have
aged
quite
well
cant
wait
to
pick
up
a
fresh
bottle
after
batch
two
comes
out
soon
i
was
so
glad
to
get
a
bottle
of
this
back
when
it
first
came
out
the
beer
poured
out
as
a
deep
rich
looking
brown
color
with
an
off
white
colored
head
the
head
was
thin
and
didnt
do
too
much
in
way
of
lacing
the
smell
of
the
beer
has
some
earthy
fresh
wood
aromas
mixed
with
some
sweet
maple
and
some
caramel
too
the
taste
of
the
beer
was
sweet
mostly
had
a
very
light
bitterness
in
the
back
end
the
mouthfeel
was
very
silky
smooth
this
beer
was
very
easy
to
drink
overall
i
feel
that
this
beer
was
a
really
good
calaboration
between
two
breweries
who
dont
really
make
beers
of
this
style
very
interesting
very
robust
chewy
mouthfeel
with
low
carbonation
overall
a
nice
collaboration
here
a
pretty
unique
beer
that
is
easy
to
enjoy
and
sip
on
gotta
share
this
one
though
cause
its
a
bit
boozey
wow
this
beer
brought
the
thunder
ages
extremely
well
maple
caramel
citrus
and
wbooze
are
more
evident
and
distinguished
now
than
fresh
a
very
robust
and
full
flavor
profile
this
was
definitely
one
to
sit
down
and
think
about
as
you
go
through
it
a
full
on
blast
of
spiced
alcohol
was
the
first
thing
that
i
noticed
kinda
hot
but
as
it
warmed
it
mellowed
out
and
by
the
end
of
the
session
had
all
but
blended
into
the
background
and
simply
become
an
outstanding
ale
loads
of
dark
fruit
notes
were
permeating
through
the
flavor
prunes
raisins
figs
all
very
discernable
in
the
flavor
and
really
adding
balance
to
it
as
they
melded
together
lots
of
spice
here
as
well
very
big
the
notes
of
oak
and
wood
in
the
flavor
were
clearly
becoming
evident
as
it
warmed
giving
it
a
very
subtle
yet
very
powerful
presence
i
can
see
why
people
rave
about
this
it
is
very
unique
very
dark
and
very
seductive
almost
the
flavor
really
needed
some
time
to
catch
up
with
you
the
first
few
sips
were
nothing
compared
to
the
last
few
really
outstandingt
silky
smoothness
that
really
lets
the
flavor
pop
and
keeps
it
from
getting
too
heavy
in
fact
it
was
really
not
filling
at
all
despite
how
big
it
was
it
was
excellent
as
far
as
that
o
a
really
good
beer
it
was
certainly
helped
by
the
cask
but
the
flavors
were
nice
and
it
was
incredibly
drinkable
for
10
poured
a
rich
brown
color
with
a
creamy
light
brown
head
aromas
of
molasses
maple
chocolate
and
malt
on
the
palate
medium
bodied
with
flavors
of
dark
fruit
molasses
dark
chocolate
and
light
booze
finally
cracked
the
bottle
ive
been
hanging
onto
for
a
bit
last
night
at
emmasdads
house
poured
a
dark
brown
with
a
decent
brownish
head
aroma
of
malt
honey
and
a
bit
of
smokiness
taste
was
very
nice
sweet
malt
maple
syrup
honey
and
some
kind
of
fruit
dates
alcohol
is
well
hidden
and
the
mouthful
was
smooth
and
creamy
wising
id
have
gotten
more
than
just
the
one
bottle
now
d
i
had
this
fresh
and
thought
it
was
a
little
too
sweet
it
is
drinking
super
nice
right
now
i
think
it
still
has
some
legs
though
just
showing
a
touch
of
oxidization
really
well
done
this
is
a
baby
bear
beer
which
means
it
is
just
right
overall
its
been
about
56
months
since
this
beer
was
released
i
had
it
quickly
after
it
was
released
and
didnt
care
for
it
much
way
to
hopforward
given
a
few
months
this
has
aged
very
nicely
into
a
very
good
ale
dark
sweet
medium
bodied
and
drinkable
as
hell
for
the
abv
definitely
some
graperaisin
flavors
dominating
the
brew
with
a
bit
of
alcohol
warmth
as
it
warms
the
lack
of
body
and
complexity
shows
itself
but
it
is
still
a
very
tasty
beer
not
spectacular
but
very
good
the
drink
is
pretty
good
i
wish
i
could
have
tried
it
fresh
a
bit
disappointing
it
has
its
moments
but
the
flavors
just
didnt
come
together
for
me
really
really
good
beer
that
bumps
right
up
on
against
excellent
territory
its
really
developed
since
i
had
it
on
tap
thought
unh
ok
whatever
almost
worth
seeking
out
another
to
see
if
it
continues
to
improve
love
the
maple
ok
it
really
does
stray
into
excellence
dwell
this
is
an
interesting
collaboration
i
had
a
bottle
i
was
aging
and
again
thanks
to
generosity
i
got
to
try
this
a
little
after
a
year
of
its
release
it
still
could
use
some
cellar
time
and
i
think
it
will
benefit
from
it
although
the
alcohol
is
hidden
quite
nicely
the
flavor
on
this
one
is
really
a
bit
too
big
to
qualify
as
an
easy
drinker
delicious
but
a
sipper
for
sure
overall
impression
quite
an
enjoyable
sipper
overall
an
excellent
brew
and
one
that
wont
forget
i
would
write
more
but
thats
really
all
that
needs
to
be
said
excellent
brew
loved
drinking
it
overall
a
good
brew
and
one
that
will
get
more
interesting
with
age
going
to
wait
a
few
years
before
popping
the
cap
off
my
second
bottle
d
a
year
of
age
has
knocked
back
some
of
alcohol
and
made
this
an
exceptionally
smooth
and
rich
dark
beer
this
was
my
favorite
beer
at
the
time
when
i
first
had
it
exactly
one
year
ago
today
last
christmas
while
i
feel
my
palate
has
matured
over
the
year
and
ive
had
hundreds
of
world
class
beer
since
then
i
still
feel
like
this
is
at
the
top
end
of
the
beer
greatness
scale
im
glad
and
have
a
few
more
bottles
of
this
and
i
wait
in
anticipation
to
see
if
any
more
ever
gets
brewed
its
a
little
viscous
in
the
mouthfeel
but
i
imagine
thats
to
be
expected
with
the
syrup
in
summary
this
is
a
great
drinker
experimental
like
you
expect
from
dfh
but
also
smooth
and
delicious
too
bad
weve
already
cracked
our
bottlei
wouldnt
mind
another
few
of
these
overall
very
unique
and
good
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
beer
especially
if
you
enjoy
complex
thick
and
slightly
boozy
beer
a
lush
medium
body
with
a
creamy
feel
a
little
hot
due
to
the
heat
from
the
ethanol
but
tolerable
im
having
no
problems
putting
this
guy
back
a
definite
sipper
drinkability
is
on
par
for
the
style
d
good
strong
ale
but
a
bit
too
overwhelming
with
alcohol
pours
a
nice
deep
brown
color
with
a
light
off
white
head
a
small
amount
of
lacing
exists
as
the
beer
goes
down
nose
brings
some
notes
of
wood
and
birch
as
well
as
some
drier
brown
malts
the
birch
stands
out
a
bit
in
the
taste
to
me
assuming
that
it
is
the
woody
note
i
keep
getting
but
dont
really
recognize
good
malt
presence
backing
up
slightly
dry
feel
with
a
nice
body
drinks
fairly
well
now
but
i
am
looking
forward
to
seeing
how
it
ages
really
glad
i
got
to
experience
this
beer
wish
it
was
a
yearly
release
picked
up
a
bottle
back
in
the
fall
2009
and
have
been
aging
it
in
the
cellar
ever
since
last
night
my
wife
was
making
a
special
dessert
so
i
thought
it
would
be
a
great
night
to
crack
it
open
served
at
cellar
temp
and
poured
into
brooklyn
stemmed
flute
glasses
dark
hazy
brown
color
nice
sized
white
head
that
stuck
all
the
way
up
the
glass
a
wonderful
aroma
of
brown
sugar
and
molasses
taste
was
just
as
good
it
had
amazing
flavors
of
raisins
maple
syrup
and
sugar
cane
rum
mouthfeel
was
very
smooth
as
i
think
the
one
year
of
age
helped
corral
the
10
abv
heat
drinkability
was
high
on
the
scale
too
as
this
beer
hit
the
nail
on
the
head
in
every
way
wish
i
could
have
gotten
my
hands
on
a
second
bottle
now
paired
last
night
very
nicely
with
a
maple
sugarapple
cidercranberry
tart
for
dessert
mouthfeel
manages
to
stick
with
the
dry
theme
with
a
light
airy
carbonation
to
stand
up
to
the
high
gravity
this
beer
took
a
while
to
impress
me
but
after
a
few
sips
i
really
started
digging
the
deep
unique
flavors
here
drinks
ok
for
what
it
is
its
boozy
with
warming
and
tingly
feeling
which
is
typical
for
a
10
beer
lots
of
sticky
sweetness
too
but
not
the
minerality
i
was
expecting
a
dark
tawny
red
color
with
touches
of
amber
around
the
glass
a
soft
beige
head
dissolves
away
quickly
to
form
a
small
ring
on
top
the
sweet
fragrance
of
malt
comes
forward
at
first
then
fig
and
raisons
come
out
the
strong
scent
of
alcohol
hits
the
nose
then
ending
with
soft
a
chocolate
fragrance
the
sweet
almost
sugary
flavor
grabs
the
palate
at
the
start
of
each
taste
that
is
followed
by
a
dried
fruit
flavor
with
a
mild
bitterness
takes
over
and
finishing
with
sour
and
tart
flavor
a
medium
to
heavy
feel
with
a
dry
and
boozy
finish
this
beer
is
unique
in
the
fact
that
you
dont
know
what
it
is
it
has
the
darkness
and
color
of
a
stout
or
porter
the
aroma
and
flavor
has
belgian
aspects
with
a
feel
and
finish
of
some
ipas
d
malty
and
sweet
but
not
overwhelming
the
bottle
is
a
pleasure
to
drink
though
the
alcohol
permits
only
one
of
course
theres
no
reason
to
drink
this
in
excess
sip
and
savor
it
or
pair
with
a
great
dessert
my
wife
made
a
spectacular
creme
brulee
and
this
complimented
it
very
well
this
ale
is
brewed
with
maple
syrup
and
id
be
happy
to
have
it
on
or
in
my
pancakes
at
10
2
you
can
taste
the
sweet
maltiness
that
gives
the
beers
its
oomph
sierra
nevadas
everpresent
west
coast
hops
are
overwhelmed
by
the
malts
so
dont
expect
the
usual
bite
but
if
you
like
belgian
strong
ales
this
american
version
is
more
creative
and
unique
seems
like
i
should
have
let
it
sit
for
a
while
longer
a
bit
of
a
letdown
but
still
alright
overall
not
wowed
by
this
one
nice
malty
flavor
enough
hops
to
keep
it
from
going
sweet
hell
of
an
alcohol
kick
but
good
flavor
not
sure
if
the
cellar
would
help
this
one
but
it
might
mellow
the
heat
d
what
a
great
collaboration
i
wish
this
were
available
on
a
regular
basis
a
malt
bomb
to
be
sure
but
never
does
it
become
cloying
or
overpowering
there
isnt
too
much
alcoholic
heat
but
the
10
2
keep
this
from
being
more
drinkable
the
body
is
very
good
but
the
alcohol
finish
cost
it
a
halfpoint
drinkability
is
pretty
good
for
a
beer
this
strong
itd
be
nice
to
have
this
in
12oz
bottles
instead
of
these
huge
24s
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
worth
trying
if
you
see
it
drinkability
im
glad
this
comes
in
the
big
24
oz
bottle
i
can
enjoy
and
take
my
time
with
a
delicious
american
strong
ale
more
at
one
sitting
nah
but
its
a
fine
drop
this
is
a
bigbodied
sipper
that
has
some
great
flavor
complexity
good
drinkability
for
a
huge
beer
poured
into
a
tulip
shaped
glass
from
the
tap
during
philly
beer
week
appears
a
very
dark
brown
not
quite
black
but
dark
enough
to
not
see
through
the
glass
aroma
of
maple
syrup
caramel
malts
and
a
bit
of
chocolate
tastes
more
on
the
sweet
side
with
a
slightly
bitter
finish
again
syrup
notes
with
toffee
chocolate
and
a
tart
coffee
taste
average
in
carbonation
comes
with
a
feel
that
tinges
your
tongue
tip
ok
drinkability
however
this
is
hard
to
find
and
pretty
high
in
abv
the
flavors
exhibited
dont
mix
or
balance
each
other
out
the
malt
does
its
think
and
then
the
bitter
roasty
and
woody
flavor
comes
in
but
in
competition
the
hop
bitterness
lingers
too
long
as
well
also
the
booziness
is
a
little
too
unrestrained
still
too
young
of
a
beer
or
just
possibly
a
miss
glad
i
tried
it
but
would
never
chase
this
if
it
were
brewed
again
the
beer
is
a
bit
thin
for
my
tastes
but
is
definitely
drinkable
if
you
dont
get
bored
of
it
sadness
i
love
sierra
nevada
i
was
hoping
for
something
spectacular
in
this
beer
i
am
enjoying
this
very
much
looking
forward
to
trying
our
second
bottle
after
a
year
or
so
drinkability
is
nice
a
touch
warm
but
damn
tasty
somewhere
between
an
imperial
stout
and
a
brown
ale
great
depth
this
is
one
damn
tasty
brew
now
where
can
i
find
a
bunch
more
of
this
clocking
in
at
ten
point
something
abv
this
isnt
drinkable
in
really
any
sense
while
not
annihilating
the
tongue
with
flavors
it
is
strong
and
it
is
warm
in
the
digestive
tract
i
have
trouble
giving
beers
over
8
abv
a
higher
score
than
3
average
maybe
i
should
consider
how
much
i
like
a
beer
more
maybe
not
when
i
first
heard
of
this
collaboration
between
sierra
nevada
brewing
company
and
dogfish
head
craft
brewery
i
was
excited
the
results
are
less
impressive
than
the
idea
something
about
the
flavor
comes
across
as
weird
rather
than
satisfying
all
in
all
its
much
more
dfh
than
sierra
nevada
its
pretty
good
stuff
and
is
definitely
worth
a
try
but
i
cant
help
but
feel
a
little
disappointed
it
just
never
comes
together
like
id
hoped
pours
with
a
dark
brown
color
and
a
half
inch
ring
of
foam
smells
slightly
of
brown
sugar
a
little
nutty
a
little
smokey
a
little
grassy
and
a
little
like
raisons
the
taste
starts
with
a
funky
dried
fruit
sweetness
with
slight
grassy
undertones
a
bit
of
sourness
is
also
present
as
well
as
a
rich
smokey
nutty
malty
flavor
these
flavors
lead
up
to
the
sweetness
of
maple
syrup
the
maple
sweetness
is
complemented
by
a
smooth
but
still
semi
bitter
taste
of
hops
that
balancers
out
the
sweetness
the
birch
syrup
is
also
present
in
the
beer
and
adds
a
unique
kind
of
grassy
tree
like
taste
this
gives
the
beer
a
hugely
unique
taste
the
carbonation
of
the
beer
is
on
the
low
side
making
it
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
i
found
the
beer
tasted
better
being
close
to
room
temperature
overall
an
excellent
collaboration
that
aged
quite
well
deep
dark
brown
coloralmost
borders
on
black
but
has
some
great
deep
chestnut
hues
around
the
edges
when
held
to
light
not
much
in
the
way
of
head
nice
aromasomewhat
tofeeish
and
slightly
maple
like
sweet
and
sticky
caramel
flavor
minor
vanilla
notes
somewhat
of
a
woodysmokeish
flavor
a
tad
boozy
near
the
end
very
full
sweet
and
gummy
mouthfeel
this
is
my
3rd
time
having
this
and
i
really
like
this
all
too
dangerously
drinkable
can
be
complex
as
it
warms
but
well
balanced
kudos
to
both
brewers
for
a
job
well
done
overall
this
one
is
as
wellconstructed
and
flavorful
as
anything
youd
expect
from
sierra
nevada
plus
it
has
a
touch
of
the
uniqueness
youd
expect
from
dogfish
head
not
a
landmark
in
brewing
but
a
nice
marriage
nonetheless
and
very
drinkable
for
such
a
huge
beer
very
nice
offering
from
both
brewers
interesting
beer
worth
a
try
a
winner
obviously
a
sensational
beer
after
recently
drinking
the
bells
batch
9000
this
one
seems
in
the
same
class
where
the
flavors
here
arent
as
bold
they
seem
less
reckless
and
more
refined
a
joy
to
drink
thanks
pwoody
i
enjoyed
this
with
a
good
friend
and
we
both
thought
well
of
it
but
i
can
not
consider
it
a
good
value
even
for
its
novelty
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
pretty
even
and
mellow
goes
down
pretty
well
and
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
i
enjoyed
each
sip
fairly
drinkable
3
5
d
overall
i
like
this
brew
i
wouldnt
mind
if
they
made
this
one
again
i
wish
i
had
another
to
age
as
this
one
seems
like
it
would
do
well
with
some
time
on
it
the
only
problem
is
that
this
brew
warrants
a
12
oz
size
i
wouldnt
drink
a
24
oz
of
this
again
by
myself
a
little
too
sweet
for
that
much
volume
pours
a
nice
mahogany
with
a
silky
tan
head
good
lace
and
retention
nose
has
maple
syrup
dark
candy
malts
and
ripe
pitted
fruits
taste
also
has
a
nice
maple
syrup
presence
bready
malts
subtle
hops
herbal
spices
caramel
and
toffee
medium
body
finishes
a
bit
thick
nice
strong
ale
sierra
nevada
dogfish
head
life
and
limb
everyone
is
making
such
a
huge
deal
about
this
beer
i
recently
saw
one
go
for
80
on
ebay
personally
i
am
hoping
this
one
will
get
better
with
age
it
was
good
not
fantastic
and
definitely
not
worth
the
80
that
people
are
paying
but
for
10
it
s
a
good
beer
that
i
would
suggest
you
age
and
see
if
it
gets
any
better
it
poured
almost
black
it
smelled
like
molasses
raisins
prunes
chocolate
but
no
hops
it
tatsed
like
dark
chocolate
coffee
burnt
caramel
and
it
was
a
bit
spicy
it
was
thick
in
my
mouth
and
you
can
definitely
taste
the
alcohol
the
spiciness
added
an
interesting
character
to
the
beer
body
but
i
am
hoping
the
alcohol
will
mellow
out
a
bit
in
a
year
i
wonder
how
much
the
bottles
will
go
for
then
overall
while
the
beer
lacks
aroma
characteristics
the
real
payout
is
in
the
flavor
and
body
rich
cherries
and
candi
sweetness
really
set
the
beer
off
well
against
the
alcohol
which
always
seems
to
be
playing
into
the
mix
an
excellent
late
night
quiet
sipper
that
i
would
try
to
categorize
as
a
barley
wine
but
the
candi
sugar
throws
it
into
a
style
all
its
own
completely
underwhelming
dark
pour
decent
head
aroma
is
mostly
malt
touch
of
toffee
and
coffee
faint
maple
no
birch
taste
is
similar
loads
of
malt
faint
toffe
and
caramel
perhaps
a
touch
of
maple
and
molasses
a
couple
standard
dark
fruits
like
figs
and
raisins
also
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
sticky
i
have
no
clue
why
there
was
so
much
hype
on
this
one
it
certainly
didnt
deserve
it
drinkability
very
drinkable
in
my
opinion
despite
having
a
complex
taste
and
decent
amount
of
alcohol
i
had
to
slow
myself
down
from
drinking
this
one
too
quickly
overall
a
good
beer
that
seems
like
it
will
age
fairly
well
d
quite
drinkable
glad
i
tried
this
brew
but
i
was
left
just
slightly
underwhelmed
when
these
bottles
first
showed
they
were
limited
thus
i
went
on
a
mad
rush
once
a
friend
let
me
know
of
their
arrival
this
collaborative
effort
sounded
amazing
and
on
a
dreary
winters
evening
i
settled
at
home
with
one
a
dark
dark
brown
with
the
slightest
hint
of
dark
orange
edges
poured
smoothly
but
lighter
than
expected
an
opaque
dark
brown
and
trace
head
and
lace
with
a
dark
sweet
cocoa
aroma
and
standard
hops
did
not
impress
but
certainly
did
not
disappoint
a
bit
standard
tasting
as
well
but
tasty
at
that
with
dark
chocolate
coffee
plum
and
a
dash
of
hops
in
a
medium
body
and
quite
drinkable
no
complaints
here
i
just
expected
more
for
something
initially
called
a
belgian
porter
from
sierra
nevada
dogfish
my
fault
i
suppose
pours
dark
but
not
black
aroma
of
chocolate
medicinal
notes
and
maple
syrup
great
flavors
of
chocolate
cocoa
medicinal
dry
hops
light
in
body
and
the
alcohol
hides
perfectly
behind
decadent
flavors
this
beer
is
truly
a
collabo
of
great
minds
a
perfectly
crafted
drink
pours
an
opaque
blackbrown
with
about
a
finger
of
khaki
head
that
leaves
no
real
lacing
to
speak
of
the
nose
is
dark
malts
molasses
syrup
grapes
raisins
and
figs
the
taste
follows
a
great
deal
with
the
malts
molasses
raisins
figs
and
plums
coming
through
along
with
a
darker
bit
of
syrup
oak
some
hoppy
bitterness
and
even
a
tiny
hint
of
smoke
the
body
is
lightly
heavy
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
very
thick
chewy
and
still
somewhat
smooth
feel
overall
the
drinability
is
pretty
high
though
this
brew
stands
better
as
a
sipper
than
a
gulper
carbonation
holds
up
well
given
the
time
of
exposure
for
the
beer
and
helps
to
offer
a
smooth
feel
throughout
drinkability
is
good
for
the
style
in
that
it
never
reveals
a
harsh
bitterness
or
a
onesided
sweetness
that
might
deter
tastes
like
a
barleywine
towards
the
conclusion
yet
offers
hints
of
a
fruity
belgian
early
on
unique
and
worth
a
try
though
surely
not
a
perfect
match
to
any
style
and
in
fact
morphs
a
bit
throughout
pours
dark
but
not
quite
black
a
nice
deep
mahogany
brown
with
a
hint
of
blackness
in
there
the
head
is
very
thin
the
bubbles
fade
fast
and
there
is
absolutely
no
lacing
looks
average
and
i
have
no
idea
what
to
expect
from
the
sight
the
smell
has
a
big
of
coffee
and
chocolate
in
it
but
theres
a
rumlike
sweetness
which
is
probably
just
the
smell
of
alcohol
that
comes
from
a
source
other
than
fermented
maltose
i
can
even
smell
a
bit
of
tobacco
leaves
in
there
earthy
and
herbal
kind
of
the
smell
is
kind
of
lost
somewhere
between
a
mixed
drink
a
belgian
quad
and
a
brown
ale
but
still
a
little
more
enticing
than
the
look
the
flavor
is
fruity
reminds
me
of
rotten
plums
like
the
ones
that
fall
off
the
tree
and
have
laid
there
for
a
couple
days
i
can
taste
the
maple
syrup
too
dried
out
from
fermentation
there
are
flavors
of
wood
rum
and
toffee
i
get
a
bit
of
the
roasty
chocolatey
in
there
too
and
i
can
taste
the
leaves
like
burning
leaves
not
in
a
bad
way
but
like
earthy
nearly
charred
herbal
flavors
kind
of
like
the
tobacco
from
the
smell
a
combination
of
the
hops
probably
maybe
a
bit
of
the
darker
malts
and
the
fermentation
temps
ester
production
are
the
most
likely
culprits
for
this
i
guess
a
lot
of
what
ive
described
sounds
bad
but
the
beer
isnt
actually
bad
i
will
say
that
i
was
interested
in
it
which
actually
i
suppose
usually
means
something
bad
from
a
beer
persons
mouth
i
can
definitely
taste
and
feel
the
alcohol
but
he
body
is
kind
of
medium
thinner
than
a
beer
this
strong
should
be
the
carbonation
for
what
it
lacked
in
head
production
sure
does
bite
in
the
beer
this
beer
for
what
it
has
in
predrinking
intersted
kind
of
lacks
overall
it
was
okay
but
not
sensation
probably
would
be
worse
if
it
didnt
have
sn
and
dfh
name
on
it
you
know
you
really
kind
of
wan
to
like
it
more
than
you
actually
do
arrives
at
my
table
in
a
snifter
dark
brown
almost
black
with
a
beige
head
moderate
retention
and
good
lacing
i
am
not
sure
if
a
beer
can
smell
dark
brown
but
this
one
does
brown
sugar
toasty
malt
some
maple
and
perhaps
a
hint
of
pine
the
taste
is
quite
wonderful
and
much
more
balanced
than
i
had
expected
there
is
definite
maple
flavor
in
there
but
it
mingles
well
with
the
dark
malts
and
a
very
nice
brown
sugarmolasses
like
malt
base
other
guests
to
the
flavor
party
include
chocolate
coffee
raisins
and
even
some
pine
it
is
worth
noting
that
this
beer
carries
much
more
bitterness
than
i
expected
this
is
definitely
a
welcomed
attribute
mouthfeel
is
on
the
fuller
side
of
medium
with
a
somewhat
sticky
finish
that
seems
appropriate
with
this
brew
the
alcoholic
warmth
is
definitely
there
but
not
in
your
face
i
would
not
call
this
a
session
brew
by
any
means
but
it
is
a
great
sipper
and
a
fine
collaboration
between
two
of
americas
best
breweries
daniel
this
is
pretty
easy
to
drink
lets
look
at
the
label
wow

you
can
definitely
taste
the
alcohol
warming
but
it
is
hidden
well
this
bomber
will
sit
easily
inside
my
belly

i
want
another

ask

you

draught
plan
b
in
simsbury
this
one
poured
a
fairly
opaque
brown
color
there
was
a
small
tan
head
that
didnt
linger
at
all
but
left
a
good
deal
of
lacing
surprised
the
aroma
was
a
bit
light
even
after
it
warmed
up
still
it
was
very
nice
some
maple
peppery
notes
spicy
and
some
faint
fruits
there
is
also
some
maple
to
the
taste
as
well
as
being
slightly
spicy
with
some
faint
dark
fruits
slightly
bitter
to
the
finish
medium
bodied
and
the
alcohol
was
not
noticeable
also
slightly
bready
and
yeasty
very
good
not
too
bad
though
still
hot
after
some
months
the
flavor
is
there
and
nice
but
it
is
a
bit
messy
overall
not
bad
this
dark
crimson
brew
has
a
slightly
foamy
offwhite
head
lots
of
alcohol
and
sweet
sugar
show
through
in
the
aroma
but
the
taste
is
rather
reserved
malty
sweetness
starts
out
before
a
noticeable
bitterness
takes
over
hints
or
dark
caramel
toffee
and
milk
chocolate
define
the
taste
finished
by
a
semisweet
citric
bitterness
a
fine
strong
ale
here
very
warming
but
not
all
that
thick
was
hoping
for
something
a
little
more
unique
from
two
of
my
favorite
breweries
but
this
is
still
a
very
good
brew
to
be
had
for
any
beer
geek
d
10
2
percent
is
very
well
hidden
i
made
my
way
through
a
13
ounce
chalice
pretty
quickly
i
was
very
impressed
with
this
sierrva
nevada
dogfish
collaboration
this
was
very
limited
in
ct
and
i
think
its
very
cool
plan
b
held
onto
this
for
a
while
and
is
now
busting
it
out
on
tap
d
so
does
this
beer
live
up
to
the
hype
no
but
i
didnt
expect
it
to
and
really
the
excitement
surrounding
the
release
of
this
beer
last
fall
was
more
about
its
sometimes
extreme
scarcity
than
it
was
about
the
quality
of
the
beer
itself
that
being
said
it
is
an
enjoyable
and
unique
beer
much
of
what
it
going
on
here
is
caramel
malt
character
that
dominates
the
flavor
and
aroma
it
has
a
satisfying
richness
but
it
doesnt
come
across
as
engrossingly
complex
as
some
english
barleywines
and
old
ales
do
fortunately
the
dark
caramel
is
not
all
that
this
beer
has
to
offer
there
is
also
a
significant
depth
of
character
and
complexity
that
is
imparted
the
the
use
of
birch
and
maple
syrups
these
complex
sugars
seem
to
give
the
beer
an
agreeable
molasses
quality
while
also
imbuing
it
with
a
spicy
essence
that
is
much
nicer
that
the
spice
character
found
in
most
beers
that
contain
actual
spices
overall
it
functions
as
a
nice
smooth
winter
warmer
that
hides
its
alcohol
well
and
incorporates
some
unique
spicy
characteristics
without
overwhelming
the
drinker
its
certainly
a
warm
one
and
bitter
f
thick
and
slick
resinous
syrupy
oils
that
coat
and
stay
but
once
they
mellow
you
want
it
again
a
very
complex
maltysweet
beer
that
has
a
bitter
finish
and
hidden
alcohol
alot
of
flavors
to
think
about
and
its
an
obviously
well
crafted
beer
drinkable
even
with
the
price
and
hype
as
you
can
probably
tell
i
took
my
time
on
this
one
and
the
beer
did
evolve
quite
a
bit
over
the
course
of
an
hour
scoop
it
up
if
you
can
find
it
as
you
all
know
since
you
have
read
my
bio
im
not
a
fan
of
stouts
or
dark
beers
but
this
is
a
sexy
beer
in
fact
this
beer
is
so
sexy
its
like
aunt
jamima
served
me
this
beer
in
a
bikini
all
while
pouring
maple
syrup
all
over
my
pancakes
on
a
serious
note
this
beer
was
definitely
worth
the
wait
and
creativity
that
dogfish
and
sierra
put
into
it
the
beer
truly
gets
better
after
every
sip
i
would
highly
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
that
can
currently
find
it
if
not
youll
have
to
wait
until
next
year
d
overall
this
was
a
pretty
good
beer
but
a
little
disappointing
because
i
had
great
things
about
it
nice
sweet
maltsyrup
taste
a
little
hot
but
not
bad
would
definitely
try
again
but
will
probably
hold
onto
my
other
bottle
of
this
for
a
bit
poured
deep
ruby
with
an
offwhite
head
caramel
roastiness
and
a
hint
of
figs
in
the
nose
the
taste
is
very
similar
but
there
is
more
roasted
barley
and
robustness
that
gives
a
bittersweet
finish
medium
bodied
with
smooth
carbonation
the
sweet
finish
is
almost
cloying
for
this
beer
decently
drinkable
though
i
considered
it
a
bad
omen
when
the
lip
chipped
of
the
bottle
whilst
i
tried
to
open
it
but
no
glass
fell
in
so
i
feel
good
about
this
beer
yay
i
expected
some
great
things
from
this
beer
and
i
found
it
to
be
very
good
but
not
what
i
expected
the
hype
did
not
match
the
product
still
a
very
good
beer
suffers
a
little
bit
on
drinkability
as
it
overwhelms
the
palate
somewhat
a
few
ounces
into
it
this
is
a
good
beer
overall
but
not
as
awesome
as
i
hoped
it
would
be
when
i
first
heard
about
it
ft
my
remaining
bottle
or
maybe
ill
just
age
it
for
awhile
and
see
what
happens
mouthfeel
is
very
rich
and
creamy
no
hint
of
alcohol
it
goes
down
real
smooth
drinkability
is
good
for
a
beer
of
this
octane
complex
enough
for
this
to
be
a
slow
sipper
but
creamy
and
tasty
enough
to
sip
a
lot
of
it
very
nice
d
too
big
for
more
than
one
pours
a
three
finger
light

fades

drinkability
a
bit
lifelessyes
pun
intended
and
limbless
not
that
bad
but
not
living
up
to
the
hype
that
surrounded
this
beer
two
reliable
breweries
seemingly
more
dfh
influence
here
but
nothing
to
complain
about
overall
i
can
say
i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
its
unique
flavor
would
be
interested
to
see
how
it
turns
out
after
some
longer
aging
this
is
going
down
too
quickly
get
it
if
you
see
it
d
this
was
a
very
good
beer
but
its
strong
making
it
a
slow
sipper
but
i
really
enjoyed
the
way
it
tasted
too
bad
the
store
limited
it
to
one
per
person
worth
finding
to
try
medium
body
overall
with
a
creamy
and
smooth
texture
goes
down
pretty
darn
easy
for
the
abv
overall
this
was
a
good
collaboration
and
a
tasty
brew
dark
brown
bordering
on
black
with
a
onefinger
tan
head
that
dissipates
quickly
leaving
little
to
no
lacing
behind
smells
sweet
and
a
bit
vinous
like
someone
spilled
a
cask
of
wine
in
a
candy
store
a
little
maltiness
and
hoppiness
is
noticed
as
well
as
some
dark
fruits
and
distant
phenols
taste
isnt
as
sweet
as
the
smell
but
the
vinous
qualities
are
still
present
you
can
really
tell
that
sn
is
involved
with
this
brew
as
the
hops
are
more
prevalent
than
in
most
belgian
strongs
that
being
said
theyre
well
integrated
and
enhance
the
experience
on
the
other
hand
dfh
puts
its
mark
on
things
with
the
sweet
brandylike
sweetness
that
lingers
throughout
some
ripened
grapes
and
some
grain
are
also
noticed
on
the
palate
goes
down
fairly
dry
with
a
slightly
creamy
middle
alcohol
is
hidden
but
becomes
more
noticeable
as
the
brew
warms
great
collaboration
leads
to
a
distinct
and
tasty
brew
reminds
me
of
schmaltzs
monumental
jewbelation
10th
anniversary
beer
of
a
few
years
ago
just
this
big
dark
warming
dessertlike
beer
one
that
takes
some
time
and
patience
to
decipher
d
so
well
integrated
and
light
on
the
palate
with
little
to
no
alcohol
burn
makes
this
bre
w
highly
drinkable
highly
recommended
pretty
good
especially
if
you
like
maple
drink
it
a
bit
colder
than
normal
however
as
it
warmed
it
became
a
bit
overwhelming
drinkability
a
definite
sipper
no
hiding
the
booze
in
this
one
the
overall
flavor
seems
somewhat
mild
almost
to
the
point
of
being
bland
as
it
is
right
now
its
probably
not
one
i
would
seek
out
again
but
i
might
pick
up
a
bottle
to
sit
on
and
age
for
awhile
feel
and
drinkability
pretty
heavy
on
the
palate
cabonation
is
low
and
the
body
is
overall
thick
and
smooth
warms
a
bit
as
it
goes
down
definitely
one
that
im
enjoying
though
more
than
one
24oz
bottle
would
be
hard
to
drink
this
is
one
to
sip
on
over
the
course
of
a
nightday
etc
glad
i
got
to
try
it
but
like
i
said
before
theres
nothing
all
that
great
about
it
to
make
me
want
to
buy
another
bottle
pretty
good
beer
glad
i
had
it
ontap
at
hopcat
thanks
steve
nice
beer
seet
matls
in
the
middle
dry
out
at
the
finish
than
to
be
over
taken
again
by
a
raisiny
sweetness
plum
and
toffee
with
spent
coffee
grounds
and
dark
chocolates
very
dark
fruits
that
give
a
round
middle
are
big
and
complex
bitter
hops
on
the
end
complex
and
good
and
ageable
this
beer
pours
a
dull
black
color
with
very
light
offwhite
lacing
the
aroma
is
mild
but
with
rich
roasted
malts
more
roasted
malts
lots
in
the
taste
with
hints
of
coffee
theres
a
bit
of
bitterness
in
the
aftertatse
but
it
is
nicely
balanced
with
a
creamlike
flavor
mediumbodied
and
really
smooth
virtually
no
carbonation
a
rather
enjoyable
strong
ale
that
doesnt
taste
of
the
strong
alcohol
definitely
worth
a
try
though
its
listed
as
an
american
strong
ale
its
almost
like
a
combination
of
that
and
a
stout
original
and
delicious
use
of
birch
and
maple
in
the
mouthfeel
and
taste
the
nose
could
be
a
little
more
telling
but
all
in
all
this
beer
deserves
every
desperate
beer
nerd
that
is
seeking
it
out
d
great
collaborative
effort
by
two
fantastic
breweries
the
alcohol
is
disguised
very
well
would
not
have
guess
this
was
10
it
was
very
easy
to
drink
but
caught
up
to
me
at
the
end
limiting
me
to
just
one
glass
if
you
see
this
in
your
area
try
it
this
is
a
very
nice
strong
ale
no
offense
but
i
was
really
surprised
by
this
i
actually
liked
it
a
lot
more
than
i
thought
though
it
didnt
have
the
quirky
esoteric
qualities
i
was
expecting
this
is
an
excellent
beer
and
i
wish
i
had
more
pours
a
dark
red
ruby
with
the
thick
tan
head
fairly
tight
nose
with
some
sweetness
and
some
light
banana
notes
very
strong
flavor
right
off
the
bat
the
sweetness
is
almost
overwhelming
for
a
second
then
a
good
bit
of
wood
and
a
background
of
banana
probably
from
the
maple
syrup
super
creamy
which
goes
well
with
the
sweetness
somewhere
between
medium
and
light
bodied
i
think
the
initial
blast
of
flavor
is
a
touch
too
much
especially
when
combined
with
the
level
of
sweetness
overall
a
nice
offering
but
a
little
bit
to
much
hype
and
not
as
much
show
i
want
more
out
of
my
collaboration
brews
i
was
going
into
this
beer
like
everyone
else
high
expectations
it
just
didnt
do
it
for
me
i
really
wish
it
did
i
still
love
dogfish
and
i
still
love
sierra
just
not
together
i
guess
i
have
another
bottle
i
traded
for
maybe
in
a
year
i
will
crack
it
open
and
see
what
happens
overall
an
very
strong
example
of
the
style
compilations
between
very
good
breweries
is
awesome
pours
a
cola
brown
with
dark
ruby
and
amber
highlights
when
held
to
the
light
the
hed
is
about
one
and
a
half
fingers
thick
and
reminiscent
of
latte
foam
this
head
lasts
for
about
a
half
an
hour
of
sipping
before
it
dissipates
the
aroma
is
dark
roasted
malt
faintly
recognizable
amidst
sweet
maple
syrups
toasted
malts
molasses
offset
some
by
just
enough
hopping
to
make
the
aroma
not
overly
sweet
great
mix
of
deep
roasted
malt
maple
syrupy
sweetness
and
earthy
hop
bitterness
for
balance
this
is
a
great
beer
although
i
sometimes
wnder
if
the
earthy
flavors
are
from
the
birch
syrup
or
the
hops
plus
the
alcohol
warms
things
up
at
the
very
end
of
this
syrupy
sweet
yet
roasted
palate
beer
great
sipper
and
a
great
bottle
to
save
as
a
conversation
piece
drinkability
did
not
disapoint
its
a
wrold
class
colaboration
i
think
this
is
one
of
the
more
complex
beers
i
have
had
in
awhile
or
maybe
it
was
just
that
i
really
sat
down
and
tried
to
give
this
one
the
attention
it
deserved
since
it
was
a
collaboration
between
two
breweries
who
i
like
regardless
overall
it
was
a
quality
beer
wow
this
is
an
american
stong
ale
more
like
a
belgian
strong
dark
ale
dark
belgian
candi
dark
fruits
sugars
mmm
wow
i
definitely
didnt
expect
this
one
to
taste
so
good
based
off
of
ratings
some
smokey
malts
a
big
sweet
front
taste
with
only
slight
bitters
in
the
rear
creamy
thick
sweet
mouthfeel
very
good
d
a
great
brew
from
a
couple
of
americas
finest
brewers
worth
seeking
out
d
hides
the
alcohol
but
i
dont
think
i
have
an
urge
for
more
than
this
bottle
this
beer
is
very
average
pretty
disappointed
from
a
beer
made
by
two
of
my
favorites
d
i
am
sharing
the
24
oz
bottle
but
sharing
a
12
oz
would
have
been
better
i
just
dont
want
that
much
a
dark
clear
brown
color
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
has
a
nice
off
white
head
that
stays
a
laces
nicely
smells
of
sweet
malts
and
some
hoppy
notes
first
drink
reminds
me
of
a
slightly
hopped
brown
ale
with
more
sweetness
a
nice
smooth
drink
some
caramel
flavors
and
nice
a
small
hoppy
crisp
taste
in
the
middle
but
smooths
out
in
the
end
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
but
i
was
hoping
for
something
a
little
more
id
like
to
have
it
again
though
dthis
is
a
little
boozy
and
the
alcohol
is
present
throughout
however
it
has
a
great
mouthfeel
and
a
nice
malty
sweetness
to
it
appears
that
it
will
be
truly
awesome
as
the
carbonation
settles
and
the
alcohol
begins
to
mild
got
one
in
the
cellar
to
see
what
happens
when
some
of
the
heat
burns
off
looking
forward
to
it
24oz
brown
bottle
a
rigorous
pour
reveals
an
opaque
deep
brown
with
some
bright
red
hues
at
the
fringes
of
the
glass
with
a
tight
cascade
of
light
brown
tiny
bubbles
creating
a
cool
effect
atop
the
ale
retention
and
lacing
are
excellent
aromas
are
sweet
with
scents
of
malt
and
brown
sugar
its
boozy
right
from
the
beginning
and
the
booze
continues
to
the
finish
with
notes
of
brown
sugar
anise
vanilla
slight
maple
and
wood
maybe
some
mild
pine
from
the
hops
and
is
somewhat
oaky
as
well
finishes
boozy
as
mentioned
along
with
a
hint
of
white
pepper
mouthfeel
is
creamy
smooth
and
mediumtofull
bodied
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
but
it
seemed
to
lack
some
complexity
glad
i
tried
it
but
wouldnt
be
persuaded
to
buy
it
again
if
i
saw
it
drinkability
definitely
not
what
i
was
expecting
when
i
tried
the
beer
i
had
no
idea
what
was
in
it
i
didnt
get
any
of
the
maple
syrup
aspect
in
the
taste
as
it
was
just
pure
licorice
to
me
definitely
interesting
but
the
7oz
was
plenty
pours
a
nice
dark
brown
color
nice
carbonation
nice
little
onefinger
creamy
light
tan
head
with
some
nice
sticky
lacing
left
behind
the
nose
is
malty
with
some
nice
toffeecaramel
notes
picking
up
some
alcohol
in
the
nose
the
taste
is
sweet
malty
and
lots
of
toffeecaramel
medium
body
drinkable
a
pretty
nice
brew
glad
to
get
some
to
try
out
drinkability
im
having
a
hard
time
getting
excited
about
this
brew
as
it
is
just
too
unbalanced
for
my
palate
update
after
having
this
beer
in
the
bottle
i
found
it
to
be
much
less
cloying
than
i
originally
perceived
because
of
this
i
am
raising
the
taste
and
mouth
feel
points
d
i
am
glad
i
got
the
chance
to
try
this
due
to
its
a
collaboration
from
two
breweries
whom
i
respect
and
enjoy
very
much
but
this
is
a
little
dissapointing
dont
get
me
wrong
its
good
but
i
was
expecting
more
perhaps
a
few
more
months
in
the
cellar
will
soften
its
edges
this
is
a
pretty
big
disappointment
for
a
collaboration
between
two
of
craft
beers
legends
perhaps
my
other
bottle
will
come
oigether
in
a
few
months
d
overall
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
i
am
keeping
a
bottle
to
cellar
to
see
what
time
does
to
the
overall
feel
of
the
beer
hopefully
it
will
get
better
with
age
nice
dark
pour
minimal
head
nose
of
a
stout
slight
hop
bitterness
of
an
aftertaste
this
is
an
interesting
collaboration
not
prominent
flavours
prevail
just
the
hype
was
worth
the
taste
some
say
it
is
reminiscent
of
the
kentucky
breakfast
stout
from
founders
however
i
must
totally
disagree
from
the
minds
of
dogfish
head
brewery
i
expect
a
better
brew
t
m
d
red
grape
rasiin
maple
syrup
came
to
party
too
light
alcohol
wellhidden
considering
on
the
back
end
of
the
palate
medium
body
and
lively
carbonation
this
is
clearly
the
big
brother
and
much
much
better
than
limb
life
although
i
was
still
a
litttle
disappointed
certainly
a
valiant
effort
and
definitely
an
above
average
brew
extremely
drinkable
big
ale
with
lots
of
character
and
layers
in
each
sip
life
and
limb
if
you
can
find
it
drink
it
damn
good
beer
for
the
holidays
gets
close
to
two
fingers
of
deep
brown
solid
mixture
of
foam
and
mixed
bubble
sizes
very
good
retention
the
lacing
aint
too
shabby
neither
very
close
to
black
in
color
but
stays
within
the
bounds
of
darkest
brown
a
touch
of
orange
gets
through
at
the
rims
relaxed
and
easygoing
nose
of
milk
chocolate
raisins
and
dates
honey
rum
molasses
gingerbread
sweet
but
not
sugary
per
se
quick
burst
of
pepperiness
and
trace
of
earthy
leafiness
minimal
hops
presence
fullbodied
not
heavy
but
has
a
big
bottom
not
a
beer
with
swift
pacing
in
the
mouth
the
carbonation
has
a
nice
fineness
to
it
not
too
fluffy
straightforward
caramel
honey
molasses
chocolate
flavoring
little
deviation
from
the
nose
more
breadiness
and
powdery
texture
you
get
some
mixed
citrus
zing
and
generalized
hoppiness
but
little
of
distinct
character
earth
straw
and
pepper
bloom
through
the
finish
maybe
even
some
bacon
solid
if
unspectacular
collaboration
between
sierra
nevada
and
dogfish
head
drinkability
definitely
a
slow
sipping
beer
due
to
higher
alcohol
but
this
has
a
great
flavor
if
you
can
find
this
get
your
hands
on
it
i
have
a
couple
of
these
put
away
and
will
be
anxious
to
see
how
they
age
the
beer
pours
a
dark
brownblack
color
with
a
thick
frothy
tan
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
warm
roasted
malt
scent
along
with
some
burnt
toffee
and
hops
i
guess
the
birch
and
maple
add
some
aroma
but
its
muddled
within
the
malt
bill
the
taste
is
great
it
has
a
complex
array
of
flavors
that
begin
with
a
solid
malt
bill
of
pale
and
roasted
malts
along
with
very
nice
hop
character
the
maple
and
birch
syrup
adds
another
layer
of
complexity
the
maple
character
really
compliments
the
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
damn
fine
beer
again
a
brewer
collaboration
has
spawned
an
instant
classic
d
surprisingly
drinkable
hides
alcohol
well
many
suggest
aging
it
id
say
drink
one
now
save
one
for
12
years
i
suspect
the
tiny
amount
of
zip
you
get
with
it
will
fade
and
become
sweet
and
more
alcoholic
with
age
d
a
bit
overly
boozy
but
it
makes
for
a
good
winter
sipper
the
label
evokes
feelings
of
late
springtime
or
early
summer
but
it
certainly
works
well
as
a
winter
beer
like
these
new
things
from
sierra
nevada
overall
i
expected
a
lot
more
richness
and
complexity
from
these
two
great
breweries
i
think
this
could
improve
drastically
in
a
few
years
but
right
now
its
a
pass
my
recommendation
age
it
doesnt
really
seem
to
be
worth
drinking
now
so
you
may
as
well
set
it
back
for
a
few
years
to
see
what
it
does
even
if
it
turns
out
lackluster
that
doesnt
to
my
palate
anyway
make
it
a
loss
poured
into
franciscan
goblet
dark
strong
choclate
coffee
ale
definitely
could
smell
nice
aroma
and
taste
of
maple
syrup
lightmed
thickness
with
a
mild
bite
in
the
beginning
smoothing
out
beautifully
with
a
nice
warm
feeling
overall
i
enjoyed
my
night
with
my
lady
notes
this
might
do
well
with
some
cellaring
but
actually
despite
all
the
hype
and
being
a
decent
brew
it
is
well
far
from
deserving
half
as
much
of
the
attention
id
sure
be
happy
to
be
proved
wrong
a
few
years
from
now
cause
right
now
much
as
i
typically
like
dfh
and
even
sn
for
that
matter
i
would
deter
anyone
from
the
urge
to
get
a
second
bottle
let
alone
the
first
one
the
hype
is
its
shepherd
and
by
design
it
is
hurting
a
fairly
decent
if
also
forgettable
brew
its
a
cool
beer
yet
i
dont
really
want
a
full
bomber
of
it
i
would
like
to
have
it
again
certainly
but
im
very
content
to
share
it
other
reviews
seemed
a
little
tough
on
this
one
but
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
it
should
have
splurged
on
another
bottle
overall
this
is
an
ok
beer
which
unfortunately
is
kind
of
what
i
expected
out
of
these
two
giant
craft
monsters
im
sure
others
will
love
it
and
i
dont
mean
to
trash
either
brewery
as
i
am
a
big
fan
of
some
of
their
offerings
but
i
just
think
they
could
have
done
better
with
this
one
certainly
worth
a
try
but
the
price
tag
is
pretty
monsterous
despite
the
high
abv
well
see
how
it
does
with
some
age
hopefully
it
works
wonders
but
until
i
see
how
these
do
with
at
least
a
year
on
them
i
wont
be
excited
to
open
another
mouthfeel
was
medium
to
full
creamy
pours
a
really
dark
brown
with
the
faintest
of
garnet
highlights
when
held
to
light
and
a
good
sized
tan
head
the
recedes
slowly
smells
of
molasses
brown
sugar
slightly
breadynutty
with
a
hint
of
alcohol
maple
and
birch
cant
be
found
although
i
wouldnt
know
the
smell
of
birch
sap
if
it
was
there
taste
is
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
i
get
lots
of
caramel
and
brown
sugars
a
woody
almost
oak
note
in
there
some
earthy
tones
and
a
lingering
sweet
malt
and
alcohol
finish
maybe
its
a
yeast
thing
but
as
soon
as
i
tasted
this
i
thought
dfh
light
carbonation
big
body
with
a
creamysyrupy
mouthfeel
i
thought
this
came
together
well
for
the
diversity
of
ingredients
involved
i
honestly
couldnt
find
any
maple
or
birch
in
this
maybe
the
bottle
i
put
away
for
a
while
will
develop
those
flavors
for
me
i
liked
it
quite
a
bit
actually
mouthfeel
pretty
thin
at
first
but
goes
into
syrup
mode
and
leaves
a
stickyness
once
again
me
no
likey
dark
strong
ale
with
a
little
bit
of
a
belgian
feel
to
it
big
head
with
craters
birch
and
maple
syrup
in
the
nose
along
with
caramelized
brown
sugar
and
mild
chocolate
coffee
the
taste
score
almost
earns
the
next
highest
score
maybe
will
with
some
age
more
birch
and
maple
with
the
birch
more
prominent
not
the
most
complex
example
but
extremely
well
crafted
and
tasty
a
true
treat
great
feel
to
this
beer
with
a
light
thickness
a
fluffy
character
while
being
heavy
at
the
same
time
very
creamy
and
silky
nice
to
have
a
beer
where
there
is
no
trace
of
a
weakness
a
pretty
solid
beer
that
im
glad
i
got
to
try
plan
to
age
my
other
bottle
to
see
how
that
goes
since
freshish
its
pretty
sweet
cheers
i
have
no
notes
on
this
beer
the
birch
flavor
stands
out
and
is
memorable
for
me
i
also
picked
up
a
dark
brown
sugar
flavor
though
i
understand
it
is
maple
syrup
cool
concept
beer
great
label
had
the
limb
and
life
the
same
night
and
enjoyed
this
more
due
to
its
better
balance
of
malt
and
hops
so
was
it
worth
driving
the
50
minutes
to
lakeville
ma
for
this
beer
well
yes
and
no
yes
because
the
pure
joy
of
the
concept
of
dogfish
and
sn
doing
a
collaboration
is
awesome
upon
pouring
i
realized
i
was
getting
into
something
interesting
and
the
taste
reminded
me
of
a
slightly
twisted
stone
arrogant
bastard
replica
it
wasnt
by
any
means
as
brutally
bitter
but
had
that
same
consistency
and
bite
to
it
this
however
had
a
little
more
too
it
with
the
maple
hints
with
some
dark
spice
all
in
all
a
pleasure
to
drink
and
would
grab
another
one
in
a
heartbeat
if
there
were
any
more
left
this
beer
was
an
enigma
at
first
blush
i
cursed
sn
for
going
against
their
hopinfused
principals
but
the
longer
i
let
this
strong
ale
mature
the
more
i
enjoyedcraved
it
i
recommend
sipping
this
after
a
nice
meal
to
tempt
you
into
a
nice
long
sleep
preferably
in
front
of
a
fire
and
snow
on
the
windowsill
find
it
drink
it
and
enjoy
it
its
a
rarity
dark
stout
like
appearance
with
burnt
red
hue
through
the
bottom
of
the
glass
short
lived
tan
head
but
kept
a
steady
thin
layer
of
foam
on
top
with
some
lacing
i
feel
almost
a
stout
body
but
with
dark
fruit
and
chocolate
covered
cherries
and
i
imagine
the
unknown
sweet
taste
is
the
maple
not
real
sure
what
to
think
of
this
10
2
monster
but
the
more
i
drank
and
the
warmer
it
got
i
really
started
to
get
into
this
beer
flavors
burst
and
so
did
a
light
alcohol
burn
on
the
back
of
the
throat
this
wasnt
a
well
balanced
beer
but
interesting
and
worth
the
10
now
to
find
limb
and
life
hmm
intrigued
by
the
label
listing
some
ingredients
was
hoping
for
a
hoppy
sn
offering
but
this
is
not
looking
so
good
poured
murky
brown
with
a
fluffy
offwhite
head
okay
lacing
strange
nose
can
really
smell
the
maple
syrup
and
roasted

not
pleasant

interesting
taste
was
okay
coffee
cocoa
maple
syrup
and
the
birch
as
advertised
reminiscent
of
the
sam
adams
root
beer
from
that
1700spresidential
series
except
the
root
beer
is
blended
with
a
nice
porter
it
could
have
used
more
hops
because
this
just
felt
flat
in
mouthfeel
and
taste
overall
i
think
ill
like
this
better
with
some
age
poured
from
the
bottle
into
an
tumbler
pours
a
nice
thick
dark
rubybrown
with
a
tan
head
limited
lacing
initial
aromas
are
definitely
roasted
malts
and
sweetness
of
the
maple
syrup
taste
is
sweet
initially
with
the
malts
being
very
present
seem
to
taste
some
bitterness
following
with
a
hint
of
coffee
maybe
chocolate
feel
is
medium
to
full
bodied
leaning
to
the
full
side
with
some
light
tight
carbonation
alcohol
warming
is
present
and
noticeable
in
the
aftertaste
overall
a
good
beer
with
great
unique
attributes
abv
limits
sessionability
as
does
the
sweetness
in
my
opinion
it
has
a
creamy
mediumtofull
body
a
bit
more
carbonated
than
expected
almost
reaches
the
notch
higher
in
score
but
has
a
certain
just
too
much
carbonation
though
it
does
keep
it
from
sitting
too
heavy
on
the
palate
alcohol
does
come
across
too
raw
though
interesting

other

blew
me
away

this
is
a
bit
better
than
okay
it
looks
good
in
the
glass
and
the
bottling
will
have
you
thinking
its
either
incredible
or
youre
worthless
if
you
find
it
otherwise
im
confident
enough
to
call
it
like
i
taste
it
its
okay
but
there
are
many
better
options
especially
at
this
price
point
imo
strong
flavors
arent
enough
to
be
great
try
one
to
see
if
you
disagree
great
beer
more
crafty
than
its
brother
and
a
great
experience
much
hops
so
wow
such
happy
very
good
among
the
best
ive
had
looks
like
camel
in
a
glass
very
cool
the
double
bastard
name
might
have
one
expecting
an
even
more
challenging
version
of
the
classic
arrogant
bastard
ale
but
this
was
quite
the
opposite
for
me
this
has
many
of
the
same
qualities
that
make
ab
so
great
but
presented
in
a
more
refined
way
mind
you
this
is
still
a
huge
ale
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
but
its
not
as
brashly
aggressive
as
its
sibling
a
remarkable
example
of
craft
brewing
and
something
every
ale
connoisseur
should
try
meh
this
is
overrated
you
knuckas
glass
tulip
finally
opened
the
2008
bottle
very
little
head
and
little
carbonation
a
real
treat
to
drink
yeasty
and
earthy
with
lots
of
oak
a
tad
sharp
in
the
finish
but
what
do
you
expect
for
a
beer
that
is
7
years
old
i
would
have
this
one
with
something
that
stands
up
to
it
well
like
aged
cheddar
overall
a
very
enjoyable
beer
if
you
are
holding
on
to
this
one
i
would
not
continue
to
age
it
pours
a
very
dark
black
color
with
minimum
head
kind
of
syrupy
in
quality
smells
of
malt
and
booze
it
tastes
very
sweet
with
a
tad
bit
of
bitterness
the
alcohol
is
very
apparent
from
the
first
sip
mild
carbonation
i
aged
it
for
about
6
months
prior
to
consuming
it
was
okay
but
too
boozy
for
me
much
what
one
familiar
with
stone
would
expect
delivers
the
goods
memorable
deserves
its
good
reputation
very
late
i
am
getting
a
return
to
the
tropical
fruit
vibe
detected
earlier
thus
coming
full
circle
not
much
more
one
can
ask
overall
a
nice
hearty
ale
i
had
this
about
a
year
after
the
bottling
date
but
it
was
still
delicious
good
balance
between
yeast
malt
and
hops
mostly
just
providing
bitterness
at
this
point
i
agree
100
with
a
lot
of
the
reviews
this
is
incredibly
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
for
an
11
2
abv
beer
if
you
liked
arrogant
bastard
then
there
is
no
reason
not
to
try
this
one
it
really
is
appropriately
named
keg
of
double
bastard
drank
2013
release
cellared
for
14
months
pours
a
hazy
reddish
brown
with
small
head
and
minimal
lacing
smells
like
my
grandmothers
christmas
cake
aging
has
mellowed
out
the
hoppyness
that
was
more
present
when
it
was
fresh
booziness
has
also
mellowed
next
time
ill
only
age
it
for
68
months
max
to
preserve
a
little
better
balance
of
the
hopsmalts
a
little
too
malty
and
extremely
boozy
it
has
a
great
vybe
a
touch
boozy
but
all
in
all
a
very
in
your
face
brew
from
stone
i
really
wanted
to
like
this
beer
especially
after
being
a
fan
of
the
original
arrogant
bastard
ale
but
honestly
this
one
is
just
too
much
i
tried
this
by
itself
and
with
food
and
it
just
dominates
no
matter
what
simply
stronger
than
i
prefer
my
beer
i
decided
to
try
it
given
the
world
class
rating
but
it
just
didnt
do
it
for
me
shouldve
taken
heed
to
the
warning
on
the
back
i
guess
i
loved
arrogant
bastard
and
was
excited
to
try
double
bastard
because
i
thought
i
would
like
something
even
more
intense
however
i
did
not
enjoy
this
beer
it
was
far
too
much
for
me
given
the
flavor
of
these
two
beers
maybe
something
called
bastard
and
a
half
would
be
better
for
me
nice
oak
bite
brought
two
one
for
now
one
for
some
years
later
i
was
expecting
more
hoppy
like
arrogant
bastard
flavor
is
more
like
an
american
barleywine
i
still
prefer
double
dog
as
a
benchmark
for
a
double
ipa
what
a
fantastic
beer
very
malty
presence
accompanied
by
a
pleasant
hop
bitterness
along
the
lines
of
grapefruit
also
smoother
than
i
had
thought
at
11
awesome
i
aged
mine
for
about
six
months
amazing
strong
ale
bland
didnt
think
it
tasted
very
good
kinda
an
old
taste
like
the
reg
way
better
o
3
middle
of
the
road
score
here
wish
i
had
let
it
age
a
bit
longer
but
stone
should
not
encourage
the
drinking
of
this
beer
fresh
on
their
bottle
i
think
more
breweries
should
follow
in
the
footsteps
of
deschutes
and
put
a
best
after
date
on
their
bottle
all
in
all
and
ok
beer
as
is
can
taste
potential
with
some
aging
though
malt
bomb
lots
of
raisins
very
intense
alcohol
taste
needs
aging
time
very
good
might
start
buying
this
over
the
arrogant
bastard
really
good
ale
will
buy
again
reminds
me
of
a
really
good
brown
ale
this
is
really
an
excellent
beer
i
didnt
think
id
like
it
much
after
not
loving
arrogant
bastard
but
this
is
much
better
top
ales
in
my
book
just
plain
delicious
in
all
aspects
we
really
wanted
to
love
it
but
its
palatable
for
slugheads
enjoy
this
time
all
i
taste
is
malts
malts
and
malts
with
a
hint
of
malts
aside
from
the
malts
this
is
still
a
really
good
beer
i
drank
it
at
around
13c
and
you
can
definitely
taste
the
fruitiness
of
the
body
you
can
barely
taste
the
alcohol
not
a
big
flavor
profile
difference
than
regular
arrogant
bastard
i
dont
think
even
if
i
described
them
differently
the
final
hopcandy
flavor
is
just
offputting
enough
for
me
to
rate
it
any
higher
had
on
tap
at
okemo
jackson
gore
inn
very
thick
and
malty
slightly
sweet
with
caramel
and
apples
this
is
one
powerful
beer
it
is
a
strong
ale
that
will
be
remembered
once
you
drink
it
it
has
a
ton
of
complex
maltiness
and
hopped
nicely
this
beer
packs
a
serious
punch
overall
finishing
a
bomber
of
this
isnt
just
having
a
beer
malted
bread
and

waaaaayyy
syrupy
dont
get
me
wrong
and
i
am
not
sure
that
i
would
like
this
better
aged
as
i
think
it
would
get
less
bitter
but
its
a
bit
like
drinking
watereddown

syrup
mixed
with

and
ethyl
alcohol
i
finished
it
one
or
two
of
them
are
among
my
very

but
this
ones
just
a
little
too
much
of

thankfully
is
a

nose
hops
malt
caramel
fruit
grass
and
alcohol
explode
in
your
mouth
in
a
good
way
this
is
a
big
beer
in
every
sense
of
the
word
feel
is
is
silky
and
malty
with
a
definite
hop
presence
as
well
very
full
bodied
with
a
hint
of
dryness
on
the
aftertaste
its
not
too
dry
though
which
would
take
away
from
this
brew
overall
this
is
a
really
great
beer
for
the
style
or
for
any
style
it
would
be
interesting
to
age
a
bottle
of
this
maybe
if
i
can
leave
one
in
my
fridge
long
enough
ill
find
out
what
thats
like
cheers
overall
i
didnt
like
this
as
much
as
i
expected
perhaps
some
time
would
allow
the
heat
to
integrate
a
bit
better
rather
than
riding
over
everything
else
pretty
good
beer
fresh
not
sure
why
the
aging
is
advised
i
like
the
hops
in
this
beer
and
the
alcohol
is
not
too
hot
overall
very
enjoyable
bigbodied
ale
that
takes
to
age
very
nicely
o
though
i
enjoyed
the
brew
i
was
expecting
a
little
more
id
like
to
see
some
more
pronounced
flavors
everything
was
fairly
mild
this
bastard
has
left
me
with
a
buzz
although
no
booze
is
detected
in
this
m
medium
to
full
body
chewy
light
carbonation
final
thought
6
50
and
10
5
always
look
forward
to
this
beer
every
year
o
this
is
ok
but
the
bitterness
to
flavor
ratio
is
really
high
while
i
like
the
flavors
i
would
prefer
them
toned
down
but
i
guess
thats
not
really
the
point
for
this
beer
is
it
the
feel
is
full
with
soft
carbonation
this
is
a
fresh
bottle
so
i
think
it
a
bit
hot
overall
not
bad
but
ill
take
arrogant
bastard
over
this
most
of
the
time
definitely
worth
a
try
and
comes
highly
recommended
double
bastard
2011
is
excellent
from
the
thick
white
head
and
heavy
lacing
to
the
deep
mahogany
this
beer
does
not
fail
the
bright
piney
aroma
accompanies
the
aggressive
hop
bitterness
it
doesnt
take
long
to
feel
the
10
5
alcohol
although
you
do
not
taste
it
i
really
like
this
one
o
a
very
tasty
beer
that
in
my
opinion
is
a
bit
easier
to
drink
than
arrogant
bastard
a
lot
of
complexity
and
delicious
flavors
mingling
together
making
this
beer
one
to
sip
and
enjoy
pours
a
dark
and
deep
reddish
brown
muddy
water
with
a
1
finger
head
that
turns
to
a
solid
thin
tight
bubbled
lace
around
the
top
with
partials
of
foam
here
and
there
looks
alot
like
a
nice
quad
smells
of
strong
cherry
wood
sweet
malts
bready
and
heavy
piny
floral
and
citrus
hop
notes
all
swirling
around
subtle
hints
of
chocolate
and
lots
of
brown
sugar
the
taste
has
all
of
the
aroma
packed
into
one
big
punch
notes
of
dark
fruits
and
dark
sugars
also
finishes
with
bitter
sweet
red
wine
note
that
leaves
the
mouth
dry
and
begging
for
more
the
alcohol
is
hidden
well
in
both
aroma
and
taste
but
warms
up
the
chest
and
belly
nicely
big
and
heavy
on
the
mouthfeel
and
body
this
beer
is
aggressive
and
smooth
at
the
same
time
its
bold
and
mellow
its
up
its
down
its
all
around
pretty
fucking
good
i
dont
know
how
else
to
say
about
this
beer
its
an
ass
kicker
for
sure
results
1
beer
strength
2
chest
hair
growth
the
10
5
abv
in
this
beast
is
well
hidden
its
a
big
one
but
is
very
enjoyable
dr
they
seemed
to
build
the
beer
around
hiding
the
abv
and
in
that
respect
it
succeeds
but
the
insane
amount
of
candied
sugar
hides
the
best
aspects
of
the
beer
the
citrusy
notes
and
yeast
it
may
be
worth
a
try
for
hardcore
fans
of
belgian
beers
that
rely
on
candied
sugar
but
i
think
most
middle
of
the
road
beer
drinkers
will
be
as
turned
off
as
i
was
honestly
this
beer
was
certainly
not
what
i
was
expecting
i
felt
the
overall
character
was
reminiscent
of
a
typical
barley
wine
with
some
added
bitterness
and
grapefruit
i
can
see
where
the
middle
was
basically
an
arrogant
bastard
x2
the
beginning
and
the
end
completely
threw
me
off
the
extreme
sweetness
and
the
high
level
of
bitterness
did
not
add
up
to
anything
special
to
me
very
disappointing
especially
with
a
10
00
price
tag
thanks
anyway
stone
stone
is
an
incredible
brewery
i
havent
been
disappointed
by
one
of
their
beers
yet
and
this
is
no
exception
another
great
one
in
their
lineup
what
a
dangerous
beer
very
easy
to
drink
with
the
abv
up
there
my
favorite
part
about
this
brew
is
the
mouth
feel
it
just
completely
fills
the
mouth
up
with
its
full
body
hardly
any
noticeable
alcohol
taste
mainly
with
the
feel
and
thats
abbreviated
mouthfeel
is
really
good
warming
alcohol
detectable
as
most
immediately
pretty
good
carbonation
especially
how
well
its
hold
up
over
time
nice
brown
sugar
sweetness
bitterness
from
probably
the
hops
and
the
alcohol
gotta
say
it
has
a
gradual
wet
bitter
finish
and
a
lingering
warm
sensation
from
the
alcohol
might
be
a
little
more
drinkable
now
than
when
fresh
but
super
drinkable
when
fresh
too
all
around
good
beer
i
love
this
brewery
they
do
an
awesome
job
cant
believe
how
well
this
has
held
up
over
time
perennially
my
favorite
beer
always
a
joy
to
have
pours

smell
to
me
is
mostly
sugar
brown
and
burnt
candied
sugar
some
hops
on
the
nose
as
well
with
alot
of
malts
taste
is
super
sweet
at
first
with
all
the
sugar
and
a
well
balanced
malt
profile
carries
you
thru
till
the
hops
grab
hold
and
remind
you
this
is
a
stone
beer
beer
feels
full
and
slighty
sticky
yet
oily
at
the
same
time
overall
this
is
an
awesme
beer
its
like
drinking
two
beers
at
once
first
one
is
almost
too
sweet
and
the
second
one
is
very
hop
forward
best
of
both
worlds
i
guess
like
it
oh
yes

this

it

side
by

is
coming
in
the
next
few
weeks
cant
wait
to
see
the
subtle
differences
mouthfeel

heavy

leaves
a
nice

but
not
overly
sticky
good
carbonation
levels
overall
an
amazing
brew
the
complexity
is
out
of
this
world
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
and
everything
works
together
in
great
ways
definitely
will
be
guying
another
bottle
or
two
to
age
impressed
there
are
a
lot
of
reasons
to
dislike
this
beer
it
is
too
bitter
too
hot
too
sweet
and
i
say
youre
just
not
worthy
yes
as
a
beer
critic
this
beer
has
some
very
real
flaws
it
could
be
better
but
damn
it
i
love
the
bastardly
ways
of
stone
this
beer
is
for
this
beer
lover
a
complete
joy
from
start
to
finish
this
isnt
for
the
beer
drinker
who
wants
balance
subtly
drink
ability
or
anything
like
those
this
was
made
for
the
guys
who
want
a
beer
to
beat
them
over
the
head
have
more
flavors
than
they
can
dream
of
and
that
can
do
it
for
a
very
reasonable
price

qualities
of
the
beer
but
i
cherish
them
move
up
on
my
all
time
favorite
list
and
need
to
acquire
some
more
thinking
aging
might
have
some
very
interesting
effects
as
well
o
fresh
this
is
a
boozy
mess
but
put
a
year
on
it
and
it
loses
its
edge
i
dont
think
i
care
for
double
bastard
one
way
or
another
worth
a
try
but
ill
take
any
of
the
other
bastards
over
this
any
day
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
and
another
solid
offering
from
stone
not
my
favorite
10
asa
ive
had
but
definitely
one
of
the
better
ones
well
balanced
for
how
much
flavor
is
packed
in
and
relatively
drinkable
it
just
didnt
scream
to
me
as
a
truly
exceptional
beer
recommended
to
any
ba
but
it
is
not
for
the
uninitiated
cheers
o
lovely
fantastic
tasting
beer
couldnt
drink
more
than
one
or
two
without
a
nap
and
here
finally
the
accidental
highway
to
hell
tour
comes
to
a
conclusion
what
a
ride
and
insert
inside
joke
wink
here
it
doesnt
even
really
end
here
per
se
anyway
this
brew
pours
a
dark
amberrust
topped
by
a
finger
of
offtan
foam
the
nose
comprises
orange
zest
grapefruit
zest
caramel
pine
resin
toffee
black
pepper
and
a
touch
of
booze
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
more
pine
which
is
more
toward
sap
than
resin
here
and
the
addition
of
some
mandarin
orange
syrup
for
good
measure
the
body
is
a
straight
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
dryish
finish
overall
a
richly
textured
and
generally
enjoyable
brew
definitely
not
for
the
faintest
of
hearts
good
times
opretty
good
im
just
having
trouble
describing
this
one
its
a
pretty
good
beer
o
this
beer
isnt
overrated
and
i
can
see
why
people
clamor
for
it
underwhelmed
might
be
a
better
descriptor
for
me
right
now
overall
its
good
but
not
epic
good
flavors
medium
drinkability
o
very
tasty
way
too
drinkable
for
such
a
strong
beer
another
reason
for
frequent
beer
runs
across
the
border
to
illinois
recommended
t
coconut
loads
of
hop
resin
caramel
toffee
and
oak
i
dont
know
how
but
the
alcohol
seems
way
more
present
in
the
06
and
i
preferred
the
10
o
definitely
not
something
stone
should
put
out
year
round
its
great
to
look
forward
to
and
even
better
to
actually
drink
but
a
beer
like
this
on
hand
all
the
time
is
well
you
really
can
have
too
much
of
a
good
thing
i
have
to
get
me
a
couple
more
of
these
and
stash
them
away
i
think
it
would
turn
into
something
really
rather
special
i
want
to
see
it
dry
out
a
little
fresh
its
fantastic
but
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
ive
been
looking
for
this
one
for
a
while
and
this
year
it
finally
made
its
way
to
my
hometown
i
cant
wait
this
is
the
2011
version
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
this
pours
a
brown
color
with
an
okay
off
white
head
which
dissipates
down
to
a
thin
layer
which
leaves
a
lacing
the
smell
is
pretty
malts
lots
of
caramel
toffee
a
decent
amount
of
pine
hops
but
less
than
expected
the
feel
is
thick
and
creamy
the
taste
is
great
reminds
me
of
an
american
barely
wine
lots
of
toffee
and
a
rich
malt
backbone
followed
by
a
bitter
hop
bite
excellent
worth
the
wait
o
for
6
bucks
a
bomber
get
it
it
is
well
worth
it
i
love
ab
it
is
my
stand
by
for
when
i
want
to
get
a
good
beer
for
cheap
and
the
double
is
even
better
in
my
opinion
always
glad
when
i
get
this
beer
every
winter
incredibly
bitter
but
enough
malt
to
balance
it
out
very
nicely
o
i
loved
this
beer
its
a
sweeter
less
hopy
maltier
beer
than
ab
this
is
one
hell
of
a
beer
once
you
wrap
your
palate
around
the
bold
profile
double
bastard
is
almost
more
drinkable
than
its
little
brother
still
of
stones
infamous
lineup
of
big
bold
aggressively
bitter
beers
this
one
sits
at
the
top
overall
a
very
good
strong
aledipa
the
blast
of
hops
is
very
strong
but
well
balanced
by
the
malts
very
bold
and
tasty
the
bottom
line
ye
shall
know
the
bastard
and
the
bastard
shall
set
you
free
a
good
beer
but
you
better
be
ready
for
it
id
put
in
the
strong
alebarley
wine
category
o
very
well
balanced
for
such
a
strong
beer
the
alcohol
content
is
well
hidden
i
hadnt
expected
the
beer
to
be
so
fruity
but
it
all
comes
together
nicely
overall
i
think
that
this
beer
is
quite
good
yet
a
tad
overrated
to
me
it
is
a
very
hoppy
mess
of
a
beer
that
still
somehow
manages
to
be
good
would
be
interesting
to
try
with
some
age
on
it
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
and
a
neoclassic
ive
had
it
many
times
and
cant
believe
i
havent
reviewed
it
until
now
this
one
is
great
in
various
stages
of
age
but
also
quite
good
fresh
o
to
be
honest
i
was
expecting
a
hot
boozy
mess
which
could
only
be
cured
by
aging
but
i
found
a
smooth
beer
that
i
really
like
fresh
i
am
really
anxious
to
see
how
the
one
i
put
in
my
cellar
turns
out
i
never
poured
the
beer
into
a
glass
because
i
dont
care
what
it
looks
like
if
you
drink
beer
for
its
appearance
you
are
well
id
better
not
say
run
dont
walk
and
get
this
beer
overall
good
not
great
i
felt
like
there
was
a
little
too
much
heat
in
this
one
that
it
masked
some
of
the
flavors
certainly
a
fine
strong
ale
but
one
that
has
more
potential
o
ive
had
this
bottle
since
i
started
trading
forgot
it
was
in
my
cellar
solid
overall
interesting
with
age
on
it
complex
and
enjoyable
overall
delicious
and
will
be
trying
to
get
more
also
i
highly
highly
recommend
letting
this
one
get
up
to
at
least
55f
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
boozy
but
not
in
a
bad
way
it
coats
your
face
hole
and
leaves
you
with
a
kind
lingering
malt
flavor
the
combination
of
hop
bitterness
and
booze
leave
your
throat
feeling
a
little
raw
but
satisfied
the
regular
bastard
is
good
this
one
is
better
but
not
twice
as
good
the
abv
does
sneak
up
on
you
because
it
is
such
a
smooth
brew
ive
got
a
nice
buzz
after
my
second
and
cant
wait
to
try
some
more
d
i
actually
thought
i
wouldnt
like
this
as
much
as
i
do
for
how
fresh
this
is
there
are
good
identifiable
flavors
and
not
just
a
bunch
of
heat
i
could
only
imagine
this
getting
better
with
some
time
o
this
is
a
always
want
in
my
books
ive
never
been
able
to
hold
onto
any
fresh
bottles
longer
than
a
week
or
two
to
stockpile
nothing
subtle
about
this
oneevery
flavor
is
in
your
face
ballstothewall
intense
that
said
it
manages
to
achieve
a
complex
and
somehow
balanced
profile
quite
good
but
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
o
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
one
of
the
best
beers
that
are
in
most
grocery
stores
california
o
a
very
drinkable
beer
with
very
high
abv
dont
know
how
they
managed
that
this
is
a
dangerous
one
unbalanced
boozy
and
overrated
and
would
not
seek
out
however
this
definitely
is
playing
to
a
niche
market
of
stoneheads
who
will
undoubtedly
love
it
overall
if
i
didnt
know
that
stone
made
old
guardian
which
i
have
not
yet
reviewed
at
this
point
then
i
would
have
assumed
that
this
was
their
barleywine
kind
of
reminds
me
of
bigfoot
or
old
ruffian
with
some
age
on
it
maybe
like
six
months
to
one
year
but
better
d
damn
good
stuff
for
a
malt
forward
boozy
type
of
brew
pretty
balanced
i
bet
this
would
age
nicely
overall
this
is
an
interesting
beer
with
a
lot
to
take
in
im
just
not
sure
it
really
offers
something
i
would
want
to
keep
going
back
to
if
you
are
a
fan
of
the
style
in
general
give
it
a
shot
if
you
arent
a
fan
of
intense
bitter
beers
perhaps
you
should
steer
clear
for
me
as
a
one
time
a
year
offering
it
works
but
for
beers
in
this
range
of
abv
id
much
rather
have
a
solid
ris
or
dipa
o
i
am
very
thankful
that
they
didnt
screw
with
this
one
to
release
a
belgoversion
brewed
with
bastards
i
might
even
nab
a
second
bomber
this
season
a
really
bold
american
strong
ale
to
me
a
marriage
of
a
barleywine
ale
and
a
dipa
double
bastard
ive
been
called
a
lot
worse
for
a
lot
less
can
i
get
an
amen
ook
beer
that
gets
better
as
it
warms
thought
about
a
4
0
or
a
4
5
and
went
with
a
4
5
really
good
beer
the
hops
are
pretty
explosive
in
this
beer
and
add
a
very
nice
dryness
along
with
the
spicy
alcohol
the
alcohol
gives
a
bit
of
a
warming
and
although
it
shows
a
bit
as
it
should
it
still
drinks
very
smooth
and
nice
i
also
get
a
hint
of
cherries
from
the
hops
and
the
alcohol
all
in
all
this
beer
is
a
good
definition
of
a
real
craft
beer
thanks
stone
for
another
great
offering
o
this
is
easily
one
of
the
most
interesting
and
ultimately
delicious
beers
i
have
ever
had
it
is
not
a
classically
trained
dipa
or
ris
this
is
the
proverbial
ironfisted
beer
in
the
velvet
glove
it
challenges
you
and
if
you
let
it
it
will
change
you
for
the
better
also
had
several
drafts
as
its
been
on
tap
for
several
days
now
overall
a
good
beer
that
any
lover
of
big
american
beers
should
appreciate
the
only
downside
is
the
large
format
bottles
with
the
finish
sweetness
and
the
11
2
percent
alcohol
content
it
is
a
very
difficult
bottle
to
finish
by
yourself
overall
this
is
pretty
great
now
but
will
make
a
fantastic
beer
after
a
few
years
to
cool
down
the
heat
really
great
either
way
though
o
great
beer
strong
hoppy
malty
just
awesome
o
a
year
ago
stones
double
bastard
ale
was
my
first
real
big
beer
that
being
above
10
abv
and
my
fond
memory
of
that
first
bottle
now
has
to
stand
up
to
my
far
more
experienced
beer
palate
and
im
happy
to
report
that
its
still
awesome
overall
i
liked
this
beer
its
something
different
than
i
normally
drink
but
i
enjoyed
sipping
on
this
one
id
try
it
again
if
i
came
across
it
o
i
would
try
this
again
and
happily
recommend
it
to
fans
of
bitter
beers
if
you
love
grapefruit
then
this
is
for
you
i
hope
to
have
it
again
on
tap
and
will
probably
pick
up
a
bottle
o
too
bitter
for
the
style
ive
got
to
think
this
improves
with
some
age
once
the
bitterness
has
mellowed
out
until
then
this
is
a
pretty
difficult
beer
o
double
bastard
is
not
for
the
weak
only
the
minority
will
be
able
to
fully
appreciate
the
complexity
of
this
beer
this
is
truly
a
beast
that
can
play
the
violin
i
defiantly
couldnt
recommend
this
to
just
anyone
no
only
those
true
beer
enthusiast
with
a
wide
range
of
taste
defiantly
worthy
of
my
mantle
cheers
this
is
a
great
beer
and
all
i
hoped
it
would
be
as
a
fan
of
arrogant
bastard
this
was
my
first
double
bastard
and
it
was
cool
that
my
first
try
was
a
vintage
overall
i
love
this
beer
i
would
love
to
get
some
older
vintages
and
see
how
this
progresses
a
must
try
o
stone
never
fails
and
this
is
no
exception
a
great
beer
fresh
a
great
beer
with
age
definitely
a
worldclass
brew
o
definately
a
sipper
here
it
has
some
heat
plenty
of
lip
smacking
hop
bitterness
100
ibus
and
an
array
of
malt
complexity
this
mean
bastard
delivers
a
real
arsekicking
to
your
palate
now
in
september
its
more
drinkable
i
cellard
in
my
cold
cellar
45
degrees
it
is
now
a
luscious
beer
with
a
complex
nose
alcohol
still
noticeable
malty
aroma
is
nice
and
it
is
not
overly
oxidized
have
had
overly
oxidized
db
off
the
shelves
the
flavor
is
a
bitter
and
malty
good
balance
with
quite
a
bit
of
cherry
and
caramel
mouth
feel
is
velvety
wow
i
am
glad
i
saved
most
of
these
o
fresh
double
bastard
is
good
but
i
feel
the
years
have
been
very
kind
to
this
brew
i
have
a
few
more
07s
and
08s
left
in
the
cellar
and
will
treasure
them
saying
this
is
a
big
beer
is
an
understatement
most
barley
wines
do
not
have
the
complex
power
this
brew
packs
i
highly
recommend
to
anyone
who
enjoys
aging
beer
to
grab
a
handful
of
double
bastards
and
stash
them
away
for
years
to
come
o
very
good
beer
i
love
the
hops
and
the
sweet
balance
oh
yeah
this
is
a
beast
of
a
beer
that
demands
you
respect
its
authoritah
as
you
sip
it
down
certainly
one
the
short
list
of
brews
to
have
if
i
ever
do
a
strong
ale
flight
for
a
beer
tasting
i
respect
this
beer
more
than
i
enjoy
it
but
thats
not
to
say
i
dont
enjoy
it
it
is
a
fantastic
beer
and
nice
to
have
here
and
there
but
i
think
ill
be
drinking
the
standard
bastard
more
often
because
this
one
is
really
a
bastard
i
cant
believe
775
serves
this
in
a
19oz
glass
thats
absurd
this
beer
pours
a
copper
to
brown
color
that
is
slightly
murky
there
is
a
large
off
white
head
that
last
a
fair
amount
of
time
and
leaves
some
lacing
on
the
glass
as
it
recedes
the
smell
is
huge
hop
slap
in
the
face
with
earthy
spicy
hop
character
almost
burning
the
inside
of
my
nose
this
is
followed
by
and
alcohol
presence
that
is
fairly
pleasant
the
flavor
follows
the
smell
exactly
with
the
hops
kicking
you
in
the
face
up
front
followed
by
the
alcohol
burn
there
is
also
a
decent
malt
backbone
to
it
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
full
with
great
carbonation
this
beer
is
great
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
murky
looking
brownish
amber
color
the
head
was
a
yellowish
white
and
pretty
thick
the
lacing
was
sticky
and
left
a
good
trail
running
down
the
glass
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
loaded
with
spicy
hop
aromas
and
some
malts
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
also
spicy
and
very
hopped
up
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
heavier
side
and
retains
a
good
carbonation
overall
its
a
powerhouse
of
a
beer
and
it
will
surely
knock
your
socks
off
if
you
let
it
oi
love
this
beer
drinking
this
is
an
experience
one
of
the
most
powerful
beers
i
have
ever
had
watch
out
though
i
only
drank
one
snifter
and
i
definitely
could
feel
it
combine
those
flavors
in
a
perfect
balance
with
the
hops
and
you
get
one
great
alethat
is
if
youre
a
hops
fan
such
as
i
am
but
as
one
reviewer
has
already
noted
if
youre
not
a
fan
of
hops
you
wont
like
this
one
at
all
4
5
stars
you
bastard
overall
impression
incredible
sipper
im
a
huge
fan
of
double
bastard
fresh
but
your
patience
will
certainly
be
rewarded
if
you
care
to
age
it
for
a
while
overall
the
only
thing
that
really
gets
in
the
way
of
my
pure
enjoyment
of
this
is
the
strong
alcohol
bite
a
very
good
beer
one
that
i
will
savor
and
enjoy
slowly
overallunreal
complexity
and
balance
stone
really
nailed
this
one
and
its
6
50
a
bomber
o
the
bitterness
has
held
up
well
from
last
year
it
is
very
smooth
drinking
the
alcohol
is
hidden
well
o
an
incredible
beer
and
packed
with
intense
aggressive
flavor
exercise
caution
this
stuff
is
pretty
easy
to
drink
and
the
11
20
abv
can
sneak
up
on
you
this
beer
is
one
of
the
absolute
best
for
aging
killing
off
some
of
the
abvhop
intensity
without
sacrificing
complexity
rounds
this
out
perfectly
a
5
year
vintage
would
be
exceptional
bravo
o
a
dark
haired
hellbound
spanish
devil
moving
provocotively
yet
classisly
around
its
victim
while
swiftly
unsheathing
the
sword
of
a
thousand
throats
beautifully
slicing
through
the
air
without
breaking
speed
as
it
collides
with
the
flesh
sprouting
a
gorgeous
ruby
red
trophy
for
all
to
be
sprinkled
with
only
then
to
stand
and
applaud
this
masterful
performance
crazy
no
as
much
as
i
would
love
to
get
my
hands
on
their
3
liter
bottle
of
this
bad
boy
that
would
be
quite
dangerous
o
this
is
sweet
chewy
bready
boozy
balanced
liquid
awesomeness
overall
still
boozy
it
will
be
nice
to
see
how
it
ages
once
the
alcohol
mellows
out
a
little
bit
o
exceptional
beer
among
the
greatest
i
have
ever
tasted
i
suggest
you
go
out
and
grab
a
bomber
now
if
you
havent
experienced
this
beer
already
if
you
cant
tell
from
the
review
the
alcohol
kind
of
dominated
this
one
o
all
in
all
very
good
but
the
volume
needed
to
be
turned
up
a
bit
to
warrant
the
higher
abv
strong
alcohol
with
delicate
feel
and
flavors
an
illusion
of
barrel
aging
is
testament
to
the
craftsmanship
of
stone
brews
even
with
some
novelty
aging
on
this
brew
it
maintains
a
signature
character
that
i
cant
imagine
fading
i
might
prefer
this
fresh
o
really
an
interesting
beer
not
sure
ive
had
anything
much
like
it
while
i
would
say
its
tastey
its
best
quality
seems
to
be
its
novelty
i
could
see
some
like
this
significantly
more
than
others
if
you
like
well
blended
smooth
beers
this
one
probably
wont
do
too
well
by
you
if
you
like
kicks
and
punches
in
your
beer
this
should
grab
your
fancy
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
hops
just
one
of
these
should
do
you
for
a
week
i
really
wasnt
at
the
time
so
im
set
for
a
month
id
like
to
try
another
release
to
have
something
to
compare
to
message
me
if
youd
like
a
trade
not
a
tradition
review
but
one
ive
been
meaning
to
do
for
some
time
stone
started
it
all
to
dive
into
craft
beer
may
not
have
been
a
stone
beer
but
it
was
surely
at
stone
a
little
over
the
top
for
me
but
willcan
drink
it
if
its
available
shared
with
family
and
friends
it
was
the
last
drink
of
the
night
and
had
it
with
dessert
it
was
a
kick
in
the
stomach
for
me
after
a
few
sips
it
just
went
down
too
strong
very
bitter
one
that
will
go
good
with
spicy
food
great
with
meats
too
overall
i
thought
the
double
was
absolutly
wonderful
this
was
what
the
regular
was
missing
oak
smoke
alcohol
esters
dominate
this
brew
it
is
not
for
the
fainthearted
this
is
a
powerful
beer
both
in
alcohol
content
and
in
flavor
i
would
almost
call
it
a
beer
for
the
whiskeydrinker
its
just
that
strong
this
is
just
such
an
exceptional
beer
i
feel
so
lucky
to
have
been
treated
to
it
if
you
can
find
this
beer
the
patience
it
requires
to
age
it
to
this
extent
should
be
difficult
but
ultimately
worth
it
when
was
the
last
time
you
took
a
first
sip
of
a
beer
closed
your
eyes
and
just
smiled
do
while
arrogant
bastard
may
have
started
life
as
a
happy
accident
on
the
part
of
steve
wagner
this
beer
obviously
tries
hard
to
be
as
big
and
as
bitter
as
possible
it
packs
barleywinescale
malt
with
a
bittering
hop
profile
of
such
immensity
as
seen
in
few
other
beers
perhaps
most
impressively
it
is
even
able
to
give
a
nod
to
balance
amidst
all
of
its
extremeness
acidity
never
becomes
an
issue
staying
passive
and
allowing
the
layered
malt
qualities
to
develop
while
the
rare
oaked
version
of
this
beer
from
2006
is
legendary
in
my
personal
estimation
the
standard
is
pleasurable
in
its
own
rightand
my
personal
favorite
of
stones
big
and
welldistributed
seasonal
beers
d
not
bad
id
like
to
try
this
one
fresh
and
im
sure
it
would
be
better
ill
have
to
find
one
soon
still
very
drinkable
though
for
its
age
taste
somehow
seems
smoother
than
the
abv
and
hoppiness
would
indicate
it
is
sweet
and
it
definitely
is
bitter
big
beer
syrupy
and
clingy
and
the
lupulin
glands
seem
to
make
permanent
residence
in
the
pockets
of
my
tastebuds
resinous
finish
lingers
longer
than
any
beer
i
can
remember
mouthfeel
is
full
till
its
spillin
but
damn
it
is
easy
to
drink
i
like
this
better
than
regular
bastard
easily
i
could
see
this
aging
well
but
i
like
it
rough
and
leafy
right
now
fun
ride
and
really
not
all
that
difficult
to
polish
of
the
bomber
by
myself
surprisingly
well
done
stone
well
done
i
have
not
had
a
beer
this
strong
and
so
good
in
quite
some
time
overall
ok
but
not
up
to
what
i
usually
expect
and
enjoy
from
stone
o
overall
a
very
good
offering
from
stone
i
will
try
again
and
recommend
to
those
who
like
strong
ales
i
have
to
say
this
is
by
far
one
of
the
better
beers
ive
had
in
quite
a
while
and
has
to
be
near
the
top
of
stones
offerings
i
may
never
buy
another
arrogant
bastard
again
this
is
on
a
whole
other
level
this
is
a
well
made
beer
but
it
doesnt
really
hit
a
home
run
for
me
an
easy
pour
into
a
duvel
tulip
from
a
22
oz
bomber
produces
a
medium
foamy
off
white
head
and
ample
carbonation
the
beer
is
a
deep
carmel
color
and
looks
delicious
the
nose
is
incredibly
fruitysweet
citrus
and
plumsapricotsand
dark
fruit
with
hints
of
sweet
apples
are
all
present
this
beer
smells
delicious
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
seems
just
right
for
this
brew
the
first
sip
reveals
bitter
hops
up
front
which
give
way
to
a
complex
variety
of
fruitsboth
citrus
and
dark
fruits
and
this
beer
does
a
great
job
balancing
all
of
the
flavors
the
taste
does
not
have
the
sweetness
that
the
smell
impliesthere
is
deep
bitterness
that
runs
through
this
beer
but
somehow
a
slight
sweetness
remains
on
the
tongue
the
finish
is
a
lingering
hoppy
bitterness
this
beer
also
does
a
great
job
masking
its
high
abv
o
another
solid
offering
from
stone
im
not
sure
that
ive
had
something
from
them
that
i
didnt
enjoy
compared
to
the
draft
version
i
found
it
to
be
sweeter
slightly
more
carbonated
and
less
complex
much
of
this
may
be
due
to
the
age
of
the
brew
i
had
it
one
to
two
months
after
purchase
very
hazy
brownred
with
what
appears
to
be
lots
of
particulates
thin
head
with
moderate
retention
and
no
lace
big
caramel
aroma
yes
it
is
hoppy
but
theres
lots
of
sugar
there
too
caramel
molasses
raisins
and
a
good
amount
of
alcohol
the
alcohol
is
definitely
there
not
nearly
as
hidden
as
the
draft
version
medium
to
mediumheavy
body
with
a
moderately
tingly
mouthfeel
poured
on
tap
and
from
bomber
into
pint
glass
pours
a
dark
reddish
amber
color
with
a
nice
cream
colored
head
that
lingers
nicely
and
leaves
good
lacing
throughout

and
citrusy
notes
of
malt
whiskey
also
noticeable
in
the
finish
last
note
in
the
nose
is
a
bit
of
dark
fruits
and
some
malt
taste
is
suprisingly
mild
very
wet
mouthfeel
medium
bodied
the
hops
are
strongly
bitter
in
the
finish
but
up
front
the
beer
is
a
bit
weak
for
a
double
although
as
it
warmed
the
beer
became
much
more
balanced
and
the
hops
began
to
be
noticed
more
immediately
and
semisweet
malts
started
to
come
out
of
hiding
overall
a
good
beer
and
definitely
better
than
the
regular
arrogant
bastard
though
the
oak
wins
it
all
d
this
is
definitely
not
a
beer
for
the
average
beer
drinker
this
is
an
aggressive
beast
of
a
beer
its
not
incredibly
high
in
alcohol
but
the
11
is
all
there
hardly
masked
at
all
its
very
complex
lots
of
different
tastes
coming
through
sweet
spicy
and
fruity
a
different
beer
but
a
good
one
nonetheless
heavy
body
with
medium
to
low
carbonation
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
but
present
which
gives
it
a
barleywineesque
quality
o
my
favorite
offering
from
stone
is
so
much
better
with
age
will
definatly
be
saving
more
bottles
this
is
definitely
a
beer
i
want
to
keep
on
hand
it
is
joining
the
normal
rotation
of
beers
o
its
ab
on
steroids
in
the
best
way
hops
malt
and
booze
are
amped
in
a
glorious
balance
that
works
pours
a
slightly
murky
orange
a
nice
amount
of
white
head
beautiful
lacing
smells
hoppy
and
boozy
sweet
and
lote
of
malts
super
boozy
and
potent
n
the
tongue
wow
overwhelming
a
bit
but
lots
of
vanilla
and
booziness
overall
boozy
but
tasty
lacks
drinkability
pours
a
very
murky
burnt
amber
color
into
my
stone
double
bastard
specialty
glass
approx
a
quarter
inch
creamy
tan
head
appears
and
excellent
retention
of
lacing
is
seen
aroma
is
earthy
with
hints
of
hops
vanilla
walnuts
cherries
bananas
and
some
bit
of
biosphere
mouthfeel
is
rich
and
creamy
with
a
dry
after
feel
the
taste
is
a
dry
slightly
boozy
combination
of
all
its
aromatic
components
this
is
another
great
member
of
the
stone
bastard
family
o
very
impressed
i
saw
this
at
my
local
shop
it
was
the
last
one
and
passed
it
by
a
couple
hours
later
after
reading
a
couple
reviews
i
went
back
and
got
it
no
regrets
this
is
an
amazing
brew
and
i
imagine
it
will
get
even
better
as
it
warms
up
a
bit
more
this
beer
is
everything
that
i
was
hoping
it
would
be
if
you
have
any
hesitation
to
try
this
beer
do
as
the
bottle
says
and
leave
it
for
a
worthy
soul
this
beer
will
make
you
bob
for
apples
in
the
toilet
and
make
you
like
it
ya
thats
right
i
just
quoted
sir
hamalot
from
the
sandlot
you
probably
arent
even
worthy
of
that
movie
you
are
smalls
and
this
beer
is
benny
the
jet
rodriguez
throw
your
hat
in
the
fireplace
and
let
this
beer
lead
the
way
to
the
best
summer
of
your
life
that
was
a
metaphor
in
case
you
were
wondering
if
you
were
wondering
you
probably
thought
that
the
great
bambino
was
some
wussy
dear
o
this
one
is
nice
great
color
and
aroma
just
the
right
amount
of
nuttysweet
flavors
and
a
great
although
bitter
finish
alcohol
content
very
sneaky
a
phenomenal
brew
imagine
what
would
happen
if
your
standard
american
adjunct
lager
stumbled
across
this
beast
in
a
dark
alley
o
a
lovely
and
complex
beer
this
thing
borders
on
barley
wine
only
slightly
less
hoppy
its
got
a
lot
of
positives
its
just
a
bit
more
than
i
was
hoping
for
oa
i
love
it
i
guess
if
you
have
flabby
underdeveloped
taste
buds
it
may
be
a
bit
much
for
you
start
with
something
a
bit
simpler
and
work
up
to
this
notes
pared
with
a
nice
queso
iberco
this
is
one
complex
beer
takes
a
little
while
to
wrap
your
mind
around
it
but
once
you
do
its
quite
the
experience
a
very
fullbodied
mediumlight
effervescent
brew
rich
and
warming
from
the
start
a
dryness
in
the
finish
a
really
wonderful
beer
well
balanced
throughout
expertly
crafted
a
dark
hazy
toffee
with
a
fizzy
beige
head
the
nose
is
honey
and
warm
boozy
with
a
touch
of
pine
and
subtle
citrus
the
taste
is
honey
again
and
vanilla
oak
with
a
small
amount
of
orange
the
mouthfeel
is
heavy
and
a
bit
chewy
this
is
more
of
a
super
strong
ale
actually
a
barley
wine
but
makes
a
nice
sipper
and
is
quite
drinkable
for
such
a
large
abv
overallnotes
maybe
the
best
thing
ive
ever
had
i
cant
see
myself
drinking
more
than
one
glass
of
this
bad
boy
in
an
evening
but
thats
fine
one
taste
and
this
immediately
went
on
my
favorites
list
simpling
outstanding
this
is
really
more
like
a
barleywine
not
that
im
complaining
i
love
barleywine
actually
its
like
someone
took
the
burnt
coating
off
a
creme
brulee
and
made
an
ale
out
of
it
very
sweet
finish
creamy
bitter
this
all
mixed
with
the
big
hop
presence
makes
it
a
delight
dark
red
color
with
sizable
head
very
enjoyable
gotta
give
this
one
a
big
thumbs
up
so
happy
to
finally
have
it
available
in
austin
overall
i
was
pretty
blown
away
by
this
i
was
expecting
something
more
along
the
lines
of
an
imperial
ipa
but
this
is
definitely
not
that
very
complex
sweet
brew
with
a
hoppy
undertone
i
might
as
well
move
on
to
pbr
after
this
next
glass
because
my
palate
is
destroyed
another
great
beer
from
the
folks
at
stone
overall
easily
one
of
the
top
beers
ive
every
had
smooth
extremely
flavorful
wish
i
could
get
it
every
day
bottle
number
2
wowed
me
every
bit
as
much
as
bottle
number
1
overall
this
is
another
well
crafted
beer
by
stone
in
their
bastard
series
while
i
wont
comment
on
my
favourite
of
the
lineup
without
side
by
side
comparison
the
double
bastard
holds
its
own
as
a
remarkable
world
class
craft
beer
o
a
high
quality
ale
that
i
plan
to
cellar
for
next
fall
and
winter
for
sipping
during
colder
weather
again
this
tastes
nothing
like
other
stone
beers
i
have
tried
but
it
is
deserving
of
a
place
in
my
fridge
and
my
cellar
just
got
home
from
an
epic
beer
trip
in
sd
and
cracked
this
pours
a
muddy
chestnut
brown
with
a
purple
hue
at
the
rim
not
much
head
to
speak
of
but
leaves
decent
lacing
nose
has
some
burnt
sugar
molasses
cinnamon
baking
spices
and
a
touch
of
alcohol
taste
has
candied
plums
more
cinnamon
dulce
de
leche
and
a
nice
dry
kick
of
alcohol
heat
decently
drinkable
at
this
abv
but
you
can
tell
it
has
some
pop
nice
beer
opinion
i
have
been
pretty
impressed
with
this
beer
it
has
a
very
deep
malty
character
when
compared
to
its
brothers
i
now
see
why
the
basartd
was
so
malty
as
i
wasnt
familiar
with
this
one
i
really
think
that
this
beer
will
age
nicely
so
i
will
probably
pick
up
a
few
extra
and
put
them
back
for
at
least
45
years
before
i
give
them
a
try
again
the
bittering
hops
are
reserved
enough
that
i
think
that
they
wont
fight
the
aging
and
that
this
beer
will
turn
velvety
like
north
coast
old
stock
does
again
i
am
surprised
by
this
beer
but
it
is
in
a
good
way
for
sure
i
will
be
buying
more
for
sure
poured
into
my
dfh
snifter
pours
an
extremely
dark
but
transparent
amber
color
some
visible
small
bubbles

up
from
the
glass
and
some

2

big
booming
dark

bitter
hops
some

maybe
some

on
the
end
the
complexity
here
is
amazing
this
beer
is
in
a
class
on
its
own
mouthfeel
nice
carbonation
medium
bodied
silk
smooth
drinkability
despite
its
abv
this
is
sneaky
drinkable
very
impressive
d
sippable
but
not
so
much
that
the
alcohol
is
going
to
sneak
up
on
you
not
exactly
a
friendly
beer
but
a
smooth
drink
when
all
is
said
and
done
defined
by
the
syrupy
complex
malt
sweetness
and
overriding
arrogant
bitterness
drink
it
o
this
is
a
truly
great
beer
its
hard
to
place
in
the
arrogant
bastard
family
id
probably
put
it
above
the
regular
but
not
as
good
as
the
oaked
or
lukcy
basartd
definitely
try
confusing
and
hard
to
write
about
but
still
enjoyable
oren
stimpy
likehappy
happy
joy
joy
has
me
feeling
like
its
1015
on
a
saturday
night
drip
drip
drip
drip
drip
d
a
definite
sipper
walks
the
fine
line
between
barleywine
and
strong
ale
as
the
bottle
insinuates
this
one
isnt
for
the
weak
of
heart
loaded
with
complexity
quite
rewarding
to
the
well
trained
palette
once
again
stone
comes
up
aces
in
this
case
double
aces
i
truly
enjoy
all
of
stones
brews
but
the
seasonal
beers
are
over
the
top
i
am
reviewing
a
2010
release
in
early
april
2011
and
it
still
has
all
the
hop
beauty
it
was
meant
to
have
very
highly
recommended
overall
this
is
one
heavy
beer
sweet
thick
and
boozy
not
my
style
but
good
for
what
it
is
d
glad
its
only
the
1
ltr
had
at
a
dive
pizza
place
in
ocean
city
md
served
in
a
pepsi
cup
the
color
from
what
i
can
tell
is
a
medium
brown
copper
and
had
a
strong
lingering
head
that
is
mildly
toffee
colored
the
aromas
are
filled
with
sweet
caramel
and
piney
grapefruit
hops
and
some
burnt
caramel
the
taste
is
right
on
as
the
bomber
bottle
says
love
the
packaging
but
this
beer
is
not
for
the
meek
huge
robust
burnt
caramel
and
dark
fruit
with
sweet
sugars
and
nice
balanced
hoppy
bitterness
alcohol
warms
as
it
goes
down
but
is
incredibly
smooth
nice
toffee
and
semi
sweet
chocolate
as
it
warms
mega
sipper
i
took
this
one
with
me
in
my
convenient
go
go
cup
and
enjoyed
it
in
the
passenger
seat
all
the
way
home
dr
good
thing
ive
got
a
long
evening
ahead
of
me
this
is
one
heavy
duty
sippy
beer
like
a
multiflavorful
carbonated
glass
of
bourbon
its
good
but
apparently
i
am
not
worthy
o
this
is
an
awesome
beer
i
honestly
wasnt
a
fan
of
the
first
beer
of
this
kind
that
i
tried
arrogant
bastard
and
it
turned
me
off
to
stone
for
a
while
then
i
heard
someone
really
enjoying
their
old
guardian
and
got
back
into
them
and
they
make
some
great
stuff
if
youre
a
fan
of
american
strongs
this
is
awesome
probably
better
than
lucky
bastard
i
am
very
glad
i
reviewed
this
growler
because
i
had
one
before
that
wasnt
right
this
is
how
fresh
double
bastard
is
supposed
to
taste
indeed
pours
a
murky
caramel
color
with
a
small
1
inch
bone
head
that
fades
to
an
oily
film
on
the
top
of
the
beer
smells
of
caramel
toffee
sweet
malt
and
some
dark
fruits
very
inviting
smells
this
beer
smells
very
much
like
a
barleywine
to
me
taste
is
very
much
like
the
smell
and
is
of
caramel
toffee
and
sweetbrown
sugary
malt
medium
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
there
is
a
very
good
balance
between
the
sweetness
and
the
bitterness
in
this
beer
a
good
level
of
carbonation
leads
to
a
creamy
and
smooth
mouthfeel
overall
a
most
excellent
beer
from
stone
that
i
like
much
better
than
arrogant
bastard
i
am
frustrated
that
i
only
got
one
bottle
of
this
when
it
came
out
i
think
that
this
will
age
very
well
and
i
will
be
on
the
lookout
for
more
bottles
for
my
cellar
the
mouthfeel
is
surprisingly
smooth
for
such
a
strong
ale
as
this
probably
due
to
the
oily
nature
of
the
huge
amount
of
hops
in
this
one
the
name
fits
d
immaculate
if
you
take
one
thing
away
from
this
review
take
a
hearty
sip
of
one
of
these
and
then
just
pay
attention
for
like
5
minutes
things
just
keep
happening
i
guess
there
is
something
to
be
said
for
the
merits
of
complex
malt
overall
dab
is
a
very
solid
brew
and
i
am
glad
i
bought
this
beer
since
no
2011
sn
bigfoot
was
distributed
in
my
area
as
of
yet
waited
in
line
for
a
long
time
for
the
special
release
of
the
2006
vintage
it
was
well
worth
the
wait
the
taste
of
this
was
amazing
smooth
and
complex
the
beer
took
on
a
different
feel
from
a
typical
double
bastard
the
warmth
from
the
alcohol
was
definitely
there
as
this
beer
wasnt
messing
around
my
2l
growler
was
gone
before
i
knew
it
this
is
absolutely
a
sipper
which
you
know
up
front
given
the
abv
i
find
the
alcohol
is
quite
apparent
in
all
of
stones
high
abv
beers
but
this
is
one
of
the
best
blends
cant
drink
it
all
night
but
a
great
way
to
start
one
off
overall
a
very
nice
beer
to
be
enjoyed
almost
like
a
cognac
sit
back
sip
and
enjoy
a
lot
of
action
in
this
beer
not
boring
for
one
second
this
is
an
interesting
beer
and
i
am
glad
to
have
tried
it
i
would
call
it
a
barleywine
more
than
a
strong
ale
it
was
quite
the
experience
but
dont
think
i
would
call
it
drinkable
i
really
enjoy
strong
ales
but
going
to
have
a
hard
time
finishing
this
bomber
d
frankly
when
it
comes
to
american
strong
ales
theres
no
such
thing
as
an
incredibly
drinkable
beer
however
i
have
never
had
an
issue
finishing
a
bomber
of
this
beer
i
really
love
this
beer
and
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
this
beer
has
its
place
hell
drinks
big
but
also
drinks
easily
the
alcohol
will
catch
up
if
careless
mouthfeel
drinkability
exceptionally
bitter
and
alcoholic
tasting
a
slight
bourbonscotch
burn
accompanied
by
dark
fruits
the
medicinal
taste
got
to
me
at
times
but
didnt
ruin
the
beer
for
me
i
found
myself
wanting
more
of
this
but
it
id
not
my
favorite
stone
offering
at
all
this
beer
reminds
me
a
lot
of
homebrew
barley
wines
ive
had
its
big
alcoholic
and
in
your
face
its
has
a
bit
of
a
raw
quality
about
it
i
enjoyed
it
but
i
dont
think
ill
be
making
this
one
a
staple
overall
im
impressed
and
really
want
to
get
a
3l
growler
of
it
next
time
im
in
san
diego
i
think
im
going
to
have
to
get
more
and
see
how
well
it
does
with
age
as
it
is
labeled
to
indicate
it
ages
well
a
top
beer
in
my
book
i
always
look
forward
to
my
first
double
bastard
as
its
a
showcase
of
so
many
different
flavors
all
coming
together
as
one
but
i
very
rarely
make
it
to
my
second
this
beer
is
big
bold
and
filling
an
exceptional
sipper
that
in
my
opinion
is
significantly
improved
with
some
time
in
the
cellar
not
a
session
beer
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
but
this
is
good
enough
that
one
person
could
down
the
whole
bottle
thats
only
because
the
taste
is
addicting
and
can
overcome
the
strong
aspect
of
this
beer
you
might
be
seeing
double
once
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
is
reached
but
its
worth
it
this
beer
deserves
its
standing
in
the
top
100
for
good
reason

smooth
start
of
sweet
plum
raisin
orange
chocolate
and
then
the
sour
hits
you
with
pine
lime
grapefruit
more
grapefruit
and
lemon
peel
this
is
what
beer
should
be
mouthfeel
is
rich
smooth
and
full
although
the
alcohol
does
have
a
bit
of
a
drying
effect
on
the
back
of
my
tongue
i
could
drink
this
all
day
and
discover
more
sensations
and
flavors
but
at
11
2
percent
alcohol
i
would
be
sleeping
before
my
third
bomber
great
stuff
knockout
of
a
beer
my
nose
isnt
the
most
adept
in
the
world
thanks
allergies
but
for
some
reason
i
thought
rumsoaked
cake
when
i
took
a
whiff
of
this
i
preferred
the
smell
to
the
taste
which
was
still
a
bit
too
hot
overall
though
a
damn
fine
beer
and
perfect
for
celebrating
an
achievement
such
as
23
years
of
existing
dthis
one
is
definitely
a
sipper
due
to
the
very
apparent
strength
and
intensity
of
flavor
i
need
to
try
it
fresh
now
md
full
bodied
overall
the
alcohol
presence
really
hurt
this
one
for
me
i
was
also
surprised
at
the
lack
of
hops
d
well
ive
had
several
of
these
during
the
season
and
i
consider
it
one
of
my
go
to
brews
during
the
winter
season
i
guess
that
speaks
volumes
a
monster
of
a
beer
for
sure
i
have
an
09
that
i
will
crack
very
soon
for
a
comparison
of
not
only
age
but
the
tweaking
they
did
to
this
10
batch
this
ale
pours
a
reddish
dark
brown
topped
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
dissipates
quickly
and
leaves
little
lacing
i
got
a
nosefull
of
sweet
dark
fruits
caramel
a
dab
of
vanilla
a
touch
of
honey
and
some
earthy
hops
booze
is
also
detectable
but
not
in
a
bad
way
i
can
taste
the
roasted
malt
a
wee
bit
of
the
dark
fruit
figplum
and
slight
caramel
hiding
the
earthy
hops
appear
but
add
only
a
small
bit
of
bitterness
just
enough
to
help
balance
booze
is
present
but
not
overwhelming
this
ale
is
full
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
the
slightly
dry
finish
surprised
me
but
it
could
be
the
hops
playing
tricks
with
my
palette
i
loved
this
beer
and
cant
wait
to
cellar
one
for
further
review
age
should
remove
the
detectable
booziness
and
mellow
the
bitterness
d
amazingly
drinkable
the
slight
taste
of
alcohol
is
well
balanced
with
the
other
flavors
a
great
sipper
dthis
is
my
favorite
of
all
the
bastards
just
drinks
soo
smooth
and
has
lots
of
good
flavor
to
it
but
still
has
a
good
alchol
content
will
oreder
thi
for
many
years
to
come
i
really
liked
this
beer
good
alchol
content
and
good
drinkability
i
had
a
good
color
to
it
when
poured
in
a
glass
good
rich
smell
accompanied
by
a
little
head
depending
on
how
you
like
to
pour
youer
beer
i
would
really
like
to
find
this
beer
on
tap
overall
just
fantastic
stuff
this
is
such
a
dynamic
and
tasty
brew
if
you
like
arrogant
bastard
and
who
doesnt
you
are
going
to
love
this
d
you
gots
to
love
a
really
hoppy
strong
ale
and
thats
exactly
what
double
bastard
is
it
doesnt
pretend
to
be
anything
else
good
stuff
drinkability
suffers
a
little
bit
because
of
its
strong
biting
nature
of
this
beer
the
more
i
drink
the
easier
it
is
to
drink
final
notes
you
might
want
to
skip
dinner
i
can
feel
the
calories
just
piling
up
as
i
drink
it
a
huge
bold
beautifully
complex
tasting
beer
that
will
take
you
all
night
to
discover
all
the
hidden
nuances
drink
it
nice
and
warm
as
to
attenuate
the
alcohol
also
drink
this
one
by
itself
as
youll
likely
not
taste
your
food
with
it
incredible
beer
d
this
is
a
remarkable
winter
night
beer
im
definately
gonna
pick
up
a
few
more
botles
of
this
more
beer
needed
to
consider
this
further
overall
slightly
mellowed
double
bastard
with
added
dry
hopping
makes
for
an
enjoyable
beer
in
small
quantities
and
at
11
2
abv
it
will
punch
you
in
the
face
highly
recommended
and
enjoy
it
carefully
poured
into
an
open
mouth
chalice
two
finger
loose
head
with
good
lacing
color
is
deep
ambercopper
with
a
haze
the
aroma
is
of
strong
bittering
hops
and
alcohol
the
taste
is
bitter
upfront
then
the
sweet
malt
works
in
the
alcohol
is
upfront
as
well
this
is
a
great
canidate
for
aging
the
body
is
big
and
the
hop
oil
alcohol
wear
down
your
taste
buds
imo
i
like
arrogant
bastard
a
lot
more
than
its
steriod
father
d
smacks
your
butt
due
to
the
high
alcohol
content
its
delicous
not
overly
bitter
and
imminently
drinkable
but
very
strong
respect
this
brew
or
itll
git
ya
definitely
sweetened
up
from
age
compared
to
the
10
d
drinkability
is
high
while
its
not
the
hop
bomb
i
was
expecting
from
a
stone
beer
it
borrows
some
balance
excellence
from
old
guardian
and
is
incredibly
easy
to
drink
the
alcohol
is
only
there
to
tempt
you
while
the
flavors
pop
long
after
the
sip
is
done
but
unfortunately
as
it
warms
the
alcohol
becomes
much
more
prominent
d
this
beer
should
have
been
named
sneaky
bastard
for
the
way
it
hides
the
11
2
abv
m
d
smooth
considering
the
strength
of
the
taste
as
well
as
the
abv
you
can
taste
and
feel
the
high
content
this
would
be
a
great
one
to
cellar
for
a
while
and
see
how
it
changes
drinkable
if
in
the
mood
but
cant
have
more
than
one
and
cannot
drink
this
quickly
very
strong
in
many
ways
great
beer
pours
a
hazy
orangeish
to
amber
color
with
a
light
tan
head
in
the
aroma
dark
fruit
and
nice
big
presence
of
hops
in
the
taste
dark
fruit
a
nice
balanced
alcohol
burn
and
a
nice
hop
presence
a
hop
bite
with
a
medium
to
bigger
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
semi
dry
hop
and
a
alcohol
aftertaste
big
hops
in
a
barleywine
nice
alcohol
presence
but
still
mellow
drinkability
this
has
everything
a
wellhopped
beer
should
have
dynamic
hops
high
abv
yet
not
overpowering
taste
of
alcohol
and
fresh
yet
ageable
taste
definitely
one
to
be
enjoyed
typical
stone
screenprinted
label
with
a
long
paragraph
about
advertising
and
its
effects
pours
a
beautiful
darkish
amberbrown
color
with
a
monster
2
finger
head
massive
amounts
of
lacing
alcohol
hits
the
nose
first
with
a
bit
of
hops
huge
sweet
malt
and
dark
fruit
very
complex
complex
taste
as
well
with
sweet
malt
loads
and
loads
of
alcohol
dark
fruit
cherries
caramel
mouthfeel
is
excellent
and
serves
to
complement
the
complex
taste
and
the
drinkability
is
excellent
for
a
beer
of
this
abv
i
could
down
two
or
three
bombers
of
this
easily
though
i
unfortunately
would
pass
out
piss
drunk
afterwards
the
cpj
i
love
most
everything
from
stone
and
this
is
no
exception
this
was
a
wonderful
punch
in
the
mouth
that
kept
up
its
offensive
party
throughout
the
entire
beautiful
bomber
d
its
really
delicious
and
a
quite
a
treat
not
thirst
quenching
but
something
to
be
savored
like
a
fine
hoppy
wine
another
great
beer
from
stone
better
than
the
arrogant
bastard
will
be
trying
lukcy
next
the
feel
is
excellent
stone
really
has
this
aspect
down
to
an
art
the
carbonation
stings
with
the
alcohol
initially
that
dies
down
quickly
and
allows
a
bold
dryness
to
take
over
the
body
is
very
full
yet
the
dry
finish
urges
me
to
sip
on
this
beer
is
not
joking
a
bomber
of
this
bass
turd
goes
a
long
way
this
beer
is
what
beer
should
be
anything
that
may
be
considered
a
negative
in
this
beer
is
a
high
abv
that
lowers
the
drinkability
just
slightly
i
suggest
this
beer
to
any
stone
fan
dwell
its
a
heavy
beer
the
abv
is
noticeable
but
its
a
very
enjoyable
beer
all
the
way
through
if
i
wasnt
leaving
this
bar
right
now
i
would
have
another
i
liked
this
a
lot
and
was
very
lucky
to
find
this
on
tap
drink
i
feel
worthy
now
no
real
explanation
needed
just
a
very
good
very
big
beer
d
very
good
for
a
cold
winter
night
while
watching
hockey
i
shared
this
and
needed
to
boozy
and
rich
worth
a
try
d
only
slight
alc
a
great
beer
09
pours
a
cloudy
amber
color
with
nice
offwhite
head
10
looks
similar
other
than
the
head
is
a
bit
smaller
09
has
much
more
barleywinestyle
aromas
than
the
10
10
definitely
has
more
hop
aromas
sweet
caramel
and
delicious
dark
fruits
in
the
09
that
are
not
as
in
your
face
as
the
10
the
tastes
are
similar
but
have
some
distinctions
the
10
is
definitely
more
boozy
the
alcohol
in
the
09
has
blended
nicely
with
the
malt
and
hops
to
make
somewhat
of
a
hoppy
barleywine
taste
almost
like
a
bolder
sierra
bigfoot
the
10
is
quite
hot
with
more
hoppiness
lingering
than
the
09
mouthfeel
is
similar
on
the
two
but
drinkability
seems
to
be
easier
on
the
aged
one
im
choosing
to
review
the
09
as
i
believe
this
should
be
enjoyed
after
aging
d
i
was
a
bit
worried
this
wasnt
going
to
differentiate
itself
from
regular
arrogant
bastard
enough
but
it
sure
did
dangerously
drinkable
for
11
2
though
im
near
the
end
of
the
bomber
and
the
warmth
begins
to
set
in
at
the
price
point
i
got
it
at
9
a
bomber
it
was
a
solid
deal
not
an
every
night
beer
but
only
because
i
am
not
worthy
dthe
dryness
hurts
the
drinkability
for
me
but
extremely
flavorful
the
11
abv
is
not
really
noticed
a
good
beer
but
i
liked
the
oaked
aged
arrogant
bastard
better
will
definitely
have
this
one
again
though
drinkability
wise
i
cannot
get
passed
how
delicious
this
is
i
cant
say
much
else
enough
said
a
bit
of
dryness
in
the
mouth
in
the
mouth
but
my
only
issue
is
that
it
tastes
to
much
like
the
regular
bastard
maybe
a
little
more
hopy
but
nothing
really
jumps
out
to
me
that
it
is
really
really
different
but
all
in
all
its
still
really
good
this
is
quite
good
but
the
nose
leaves
me
a
bit
disappointed
i
would
easily
have
this
again
but
i
would
have
to
be
in
the
right
mood
for
it
it
isnt
something
i
am
going
to
be
dreaming
about
or
reminiscing
about
for
much
or
if
at
all
drinkability
im
a
sucker
for
a
good
strong
ale
and
this
is
probably
the
best
ive
ever
tasted
a
memorable
beer
experience
that
blasted
my
taste
buds
at
just
under
75
cents
an
ounce
bar
price
its
a
good
value
given
the
quality
of
the
brew
id
definitely
buy
it
again
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
plan
to
do
so
the
next
time
i
visit
my
nearby
beer
bar
d
given
its
size
it
is
quite
drinkable
22oz
bottle
poured
into
a
tulip
2010
vintage
pours
a
cloudy
reddish
orange
with
one
finger
of
foam
and
good
carbonation
evident
good
lacing
nose
is
sweet
and
malty
but
not
so
rich
as
to
be
syrupy
a
little
nutty
but
mainly
it
just
smells
like
a
massive
beer
very
nice
mouthfeel
for
such
a
big
beer
full
bodied
but
the
carbonation
doesnt
let
it
sit
too
heavy
on
the
palate
for
a
beer
with
no
evidence
of
hops
on
the
nose
it
is
surprisingly
bitter
on
the
palate
a
malty
sweetness
comes
on
smooth
and
is
balanced
out
by
a
mouthful
of
resiny
hops
the
finish
is
hoppy
but
not
overly
so
the
malt
balances
quite
well
here
so
the
finish
is
light
long
and
very
enjoyable
not
as
clean
a
finish
as
the
lucky
bastard
but
similar
in
character
one
of
the
best
beers
over
10
abv
you
will
find
and
worth
every
penny
served
in
a
stone
pint
glass
that
i
was
fortunate
enough
to
get
for
2
00
with
the
purchase
of
the
brew
the
brew
pours
a
brownish
amber
color
with
an
ample
amount
of
foamy
off
white
head
that
lingers
nicely
for
a
bit
on
the
top
of
the
brew
double
bastard
leaves
a
significant
amount
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
beer
has
a
great
scent
of
hops
with
a
slight
grapefruit
note
and
a
nice
underlying
medium
malt
note
that
helps
to
counter
the
hop
intensity
a
bit
double
bastards
taste
nearly
precisely
matches
the
scent
but
there
is
a
slight
alcohol
sting
that
kicks
it
way
through
just
to
remind
you
that
it
is
a
strong
ale
overall
the
brew
drinks
as
smoothly
as
something
that
offensive
and
intense
possibly
could
and
only
furthers
my
assertion
that
stone
is
making
some
of
the
best
beers
on
the
planet
if
you
have
never
had
a
brew
by
stone
you
have
never
had
a
beer
d
its
a
sipping
hopfest
a
beer
that
should
be
paired
with
a
meal
drinkability
magic
elixir
and
gods
gift
to
humanity
i
wasnt
going
to
rate
this
brew
this
high
but
its
the
right
mix
of
complexity
and
taste
d
this
beer
is
tasty
and
im
happy
i
tried
it
but
im
also
happy
i
didnt
have
to
trade
it
worth
trying
for
sure
and
its
tasty
but
nothing
out
of
this
world
whiskeylike
after
dinner
sipper
makes
the
2010
taste
like
cherry
juice
d
very
tasty
but
could
maybe
use
an
extra
year
in
the
cellar
to
even
out
the
alcohol
bottle
from
2010
was
satisfied
with
one
tulipfull
this
brew
pours
a
deeprichorangecopper
hue
with
nice
carbonation
that
leaves
behind
a
one
finger
head
and
some
sporadic
lacingthe
smell
is
a
combination
of
sweet
honeysticky
caramel
and
piney
resinous
hopsit
has
a
nice
above
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
which
is
perfectly
carbonated
to
give
it
a
real
slicksticky
smooth
feel
and
allows
the
tastes
of
jarrah
honeymaple
syrupsticky
toffeea
hint
of
peach
and
sticky
resinous
piney
hops
coated
in
brown
sugar
all
to
blend
very
nicely
and
overall
given
its
big
abv
you
cannot
really
taste
it
but
believe
me
its
definately
a
creeper
and
one
of
those
drops
that
you
really
only
need
one
of
in
a
sitting
to
appreciate
it
and
i
will
most
definately
buy
again
without
doubt
d
as
drinkable
as
youd
expect
for
the
style
and
abv
the
high
abv
does
make
this
a
sipper
and
the
alcohol
warmth
develops
as
you
work
your
way
through
the
glass
d
very
drinkable
and
good
tasting
but
to
me
it
didnt
seem
to
have
the
sort
of
character
that
the
other
bastards
have
at
11
2
it
goes
down
before
you
know
it
i
like
this
beer
but
its
not
something
i
wait
eagerly
for
or
pick
up
often
d
definitely
a
sipper
i
couldnt
finish
it
bitter
and
boozy
no
sense
of
balance
with
flavors
this
is
a
hard
one
to
rate
for
me
while
the
flavor
is
complex
sweet
and
balanced
its
a
little
too
candy
cherry
for
my
taste
i
could
see
this
growing
on
me
though
i
still
prefer
the
oaked
bastard
proost
doverall
another
great
brew
from
stone
however
i
didnt
enjoy
this
one
as
much
as
their
arrogant
or
oaked
arrogant
but
thats
not
an
important
point
what
is
important
is
the
fact
that
this
is
a
great
beer
pours
a
nice
deep
ruby
color
with
a
two
finger
head
which
stays
at
a
skim
and
gives
way
to
gobs
of
lacing
up
and
down
the
glass
the
nose
is
of
caramel
malt
and
other
sweet
malts
with
a
citrus
hop
bite
the
taste
is
of
a
nice
sweetness
but
not
overly
sweet
caramel
malts
toffee
and
a
little
breadiness
at
the
backend
there
is
a
nice
citrus
hop
bite
that
bring
great
balance
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
carbonated
and
a
little
creamy
the
drinkability
is
great
there
is
no
presence
of
the
high
alcohol
great
balance
of
alcohol
to
flavors
the
flavors
are
also
balanced
greatly
and
overall
great
beer
d
the
drinkability
for
this
is
awesome
i
know
its
11
2
abv
but
honestly
i
cant
tell
it
goes
down
very
easily
and
has
a
great
mouthfeel
with
zero
alcohol
burn
great
job
stone
d
this
is
a
sipper
and
the
mouthfeel
wasnt
incredible
but
okay
the
taste
wasnt
incredible
had
this
on
at
at
burp
castle
in
new
york
city
pours
an
amber
brown
colour
with
thin
offwhite
head
nice
head
retention
and
lacing
around
much
of
the
glass
smells
of
citrus
hops
with
a
huge
caramel
malt
really
well
balanced
with
sweetness
and
bitterness
almost
like
a
fresh
hoppy
barleywine
some
alcohol
is
noticeable
but
it
doesnt
make
this
undrinkable
or
anything
thick
mediumbodied
mouthfeel
i
love
this
beer
poured
ontap
at
the
stone
brewery
the
beer
was
poured
into
a
pint
glass
with
an
amberbrown
color
very
vibrant
and
deep
the
beer
has
a
thin
cream
colored
head
there
is
a
strong
heavy
caramel
apple
smell
to
the
beer
with
old
world
fruit
and
a
o
ple
highlights
the
taste
is
also
very
heavy
with
a
strong
sweat
quadrupel
style
flavor
toffee
caramel
subtle
char
fig
and
date
all
blending
with
a
booze
overtone
to
provide
a
big
beefy
palate
there
is
a
sharp
roasted
malt
finish
with
a
richly
sweet
and
char
bitter
aftertaste
the
finish
is
boozy
and
rich
with
a
very
cloying
linger
big
beer
22
oz
bottle
poured
into
pint
glass
dangerously
smooth
for
the
11
2
alchohol
will
definetly
creep
up
on
you
im
a
total
hophead
and
this
beer
still
pleases
the
pallet
be
careful
definitely
wouldnt
be
a
good
first
beer
but
work
up
to
this
one
definite
cant
miss
deep
amber
brown
translucent
with
thick
offwhite
to
tan
head
great
head
retention
with
some
lacing
rich
malty
aroma
bready
some
caramel
with
raisin
and
dark
fruit
as
well
resinous
hop
aroma
is
subdued
but
pleasant
flavor
is
sweet
and
malty
as
well
more
rich
dark
fruit
with
notes
of
spice
and
some
licorice
bitter
but
not
intensely
so
hits
a
smooth
balance
with
plenty
of
planty
resinous
hops
thick
chewy
mouthfeel
little
to
no
alcohol
presence
for
a
huge
strong
ale
this
one
is
incredibly
well
balanced
and
smooth
d
almost
too
high
for
the
price
the
alcohol
content
and
the
quality
this
is
pretty
hard
to
beat
i
like
it
more
than
some
beers
that
handily
trump
this
in
price
to
admit
my
bias
i
have
found
other
stone
beers
underwhelming
but
this
comes
through
certainly
not
a
summer
chugging
beer
it
suits
the
current
winter
perfectly
well
done
stone
i
enjoy
stone
products
because
i
live
near
san
diego
i
however
dont
feel
that
they
are
an
a
company
i
enjoy
the
freshness
and
feel
that
the
double
is
their
best
product
but
it
is
not
a
goto
beer
it
is
something
ill
bring
a
couple
bottles
to
a
party
and
fill
5
plastic
cups
up
halfway
and
get
a
bunch
of
peoples
reactions
its
not
a
staple
so
for
that
it
loses
points
for
what
it
is
it
is
great
you
must
try
it
served
from
a
22oz
bottle
at
fifty
brews
in
orlando
i
was
curious
if
i
would
like
this
as
i
respect
but
was
not
a
huge
fan
of
arrogant
bastard
this
beer
takes
it
to
a
new
level
mouthfeel
is
unlike
almost
any
beer
out
there
alcohol
content
is
high
but
not
terribly
noticeable
taste
is
very
complex
and
very
interesting
would
recommend
this
to
all
true
beer
lovers
22oz
probably
a
little
too
much
would
have
really
enjoyed
a
nice
pint
of
it
on
draft
im
puzzled
by
this
beer
its
definitely
not
a
session
beer
i
cant
imagine
it
going
well
with
any
kind
of
food
really
yet
it
does
create
an
experience
i
cant
say
im
a
fan
though
maybe
i
have
to
try
another
bottle
bastard
is
a
very
good
beer
but
double
bastard
takes
it
to
another
level
this
is
just
a
fantastically
complex
and
tasty
brew
db
is
a
worldclass
beer
and
one
that
deserves
to
be
consumed
in
earnest
overall
a
decent
beer
thats
much
better
than
the
original
ab
certainly
worth
trying
drinkability
a
delicious
treat
lots
of
hops
and
alcohol
but
not
overdone
mouthfeeldrinkability
medium
bodied
with
fairly
low
carbonation
leads
to
a
syrupy
very
smooth
drinking
beer
very
nice
this
is
a
pretty
strong
beer
and
i
can
tell
its
certainly
not
a
chore
to
drink
but
its
also
not
the
most
drinkable
beer
ive
had
by
any
stretch
surprisingly
well
carbonated
chewy
a
little
oily
and
very
warming
in
the
end
this
was
much
more
potent
than
first
imagined
you
cant
tell
from
the
aroma
but
the
hops
are
strong
nothing
seems
to
be
overbearing
making
this
drinkable
least
favorite
09
overall
what
we
found
to
be
best
about
this
brew
was
the
fruitiness
in
the
nose
as
well
as
the
boldness
of
the
flavoring
the
aroma
was
probably
the
most
surprising
thing
about
this
experience
as
we
detected
unexpected
fruits
and
dark
roasty
caramel
the
taste
was
also
a
bit
of
a
nice
surprise
as
it
was
a
bit
of
a
departure
from
the
aroma
the
best
description
we
could
come
up
with
was
that
this
beer
is
the
lovechild
of
a
hefty
doppelbock
and
a
double
ipa
giving
us
a
tasty
treat
and
quite
a
lot
to
think
about
so
good
imo
d
a
very
big
enjoyable
beer
d
the
drinkability
for
this
is
awesome
i
love
this
beer
the
taste
is
great
and
i
could
drink
these
all
night
it
goes
down
very
easily
and
has
a
great
mouthfeel
i
wish
i
had
a
fridge
full
of
these
awesome
job
stone
cheers
double
bastard
poured
a
very
dark
almost
deep
brown
color
with
very
small
head
the
smell
was
infused
with
biterness
the
taste
was
incredibly
bitter
there
were
no
fruit
notes
or
other
flavors
notieable
just
the
taste
of
ale
the
sheer
bittnerness
makes
it
hard
to
drink
nad
may
be
a
dislike
for
some
and
you
certinly
cant
switch
to
another
beer
afterwards
overall
a
great
beer
but
not
for
the
casual
beer
drinker
d
im
feeling
it
but
this
isnt
my
first
tonight
a
good
slow
sipper
on
a
cold
christmas
night
by
the
fire
i
love
it
d
such
a
great
beer
big
bold
taste
and
great
to
share
if
aged
it
will
blow
your
mind
trust
me
this
beer
is
a
beast
dark
brown
in
color
unfiltered
with
a
thin
off
white
head
the
sticks
to
the
glass
smells
of
citrus
fruit
and
malt
sweetness
which
combine
to
create
a
pineapple
aroma
the
taste
is
absolutely
huge
rich
and
complex
very
balanced
in
the
front
with
lingering
bitterness
and
alcohol
hotness
on
the
end
all
things
considered
i
do
not
get
and
overdose
of
alcohol
flavor
here
i
would
not
say
this
is
boozy
at
all
the
ridiculous
amount
of
malt
and
hops
win
out
full
bodied
and
bordering
on
syrupy
intense
flavor
and
alcohol
hurt
the
drinkable
but
this
a
great
beer
these
bastard
ales
are
so
over
the
top
with
flavor
yet
balanced
it
is
incredible
d
good
beer
definitely
would
like
to
try
again
drinkability
if
it
was
a
little
cheaper
i
would
def
be
drinking
this
all
the
time
but
you
cant
cheat
on
the
price
to
get
quality
this
bottle
is
a
2009
that
i
opened
to
see
how
its
aging
it
pours
a
copper
golden
colour
with
nice
slightly
off
white
head
lacing
hangs
on
for
a
while
smell
is
similar
to
the
regular
arrogant
bastard
but
with
a
more
pronounced
caramel
malt
sweetness
this
beer
is
awesome
you
can
taste
the
grapefruit
lemon
orange
of
the
huge
hops
but
is
offset
by
a
nice
caramel
toffee
malt
this
beer
has
a
sticky
mouthfeel
with
a
resiney
aftertaste
heavier
body
feel
from
the
alcohol
this
beer
is
huge
and
after
tasting
it
alongside
a
fresh
db
2010
age
only
helps
this
one
looking
forward
to
the
06
pours
a
dark
copper
hue
a
little
hazy
tanwhite
head
super
malt
aromas
theres
some
tropical
fruit
in
the
mix
im
thinking
pineapple
yum
im
sensing
a
whiff
of
alcohol
that
im
sure
ill
be
tasting
shortly
im
smelling
some
a
little
hoppness
but
not
much
woah
taste
them
hops
first
sip
is
a
smooth
hop
bombardment
slight
alcohol
warm
does
a
nice
job
lifting
the
hop
flavors
lots
of
pine
and
wood
flavors
going
on
slight
notes
of
caramel
maltiness
very
chewy
hop
aftertaste
its
like
a
pine
tree
was
left
behind
and
im
chewing
its
bark
im
glad
theres
not
thick
sugary
aftertaste
that
was
my
fear
of
how
this
beer
would
finish
score
this
is
more
than
less
what
i
had
expected
from
this
beer
certainly
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
a
person
can
easily
finish
a
bomber
of
this
but
then
id
call
it
a
night
this
is
a
good
testament
to
what
american
strong
beers
can
achieve
within
reason
if
you
love
and
appreciate
beer
then
you
have
to
try
this
one
it
will
be
one
that
i
save
for
special
occasions
and
celebrations
stone
in
my
opinion
has
a
very
very
solid
lineup
of
great
beers
this
is
one
that
ive
been
meaning
to
pick
up
for
a
while
and
certainly
glad
i
finally
pulled
the
trigger
d
good
beer
but
a
bomber
of
this
is
enough
for
a
night
and
wont
be
a
quick
drink
this
is
definately
a
huge
beer
that
lives
up
to
the
hype
it
makes
on
the
bottle
d
as
we
would
say
in
the
beer
shop
i
used
to
work
in
if
i
cover
for
you
and
work
a
double
you
owe
me
a
double
bastard
ah
such
a
reward
for
a
double
shift
one
of
the
most
drinkable
brews
for
being
a
double
strong
ale
hidden
abv
and
a
nice
easy
drinking
approach
a
nice
brew
i
could
have
on
draft
in
the
home
unit
the
increased
abv
is
very
well
hidden
this
is
one
lacerative
mother
of
an
ale
bottle
quote
they
are
not
kidding
this
beer
never
disappoints
stone
is
consistently
one
of
the
most
solid
breweries
out
there
i
can
always
buy
a
stone
product
and
never
be
worried
it
is
a
waste
of
money
this
is
always
a
great
option
for
me
delicious
it
took
me
awhile
to
finish
this
glass
and
i
was
glad
to
share
the
bomber
that
being
said
i
was
not
expecting
this
to
be
super
drinkable
and
i
was
looking
for
an
abrasive
beer
and
got
it
this
is
a
great
one
to
warm
up
to
on
a
winter
night
especially
when
sharing
it
with
friends
dont
be
a
double
bastard
and
keep
it
all
to
yourself
overall
this
beer
will
set
your
soul
on
fire
spit
on
it
then
make
you
pay
for
parking
tread
with
caution
poured
a
1
5
head
which
took
a
long
while
to
dissipate
hazy
copper
color
smell
and
taste
are
hoppy
ipa
but
theres
definitely
more
in
the
taste
quite
obviously
a
double
whollop
theres
a
deep
rich
flavorful
hoppy
fruitiness
sweet
malts
and
an
oppulent
mouthfeel
to
me
its
a
big
step
up
from
regular
arrogant
bastard
and
believe
it
or
not
the
lady
of
the
house
loved
it
too
and
wants
repeats
she
knows
her
bastards
d
for
what
it
is
this
a
surprisingly
drinkable
brew
probably
wont
be
buying
another
i
still
think
that
lucky
bastard
is
a
better
buy
very
good
nice
carbonation
and
mouthfeel
wow
what
a
beer
huge
immense
flavors
well
balanced
between
hops
and
malt
lots
of
character
this
beer
is
definitely
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
overall
great
beer
very
drinkable
for
the
abvs
finished
the
bomber
by
myself
no
problem
not
the
best
strong
ale
i
have
had
but
it
is
up
there
very
good
and
definitely
deserving
of
a
top
100
spot
poured
looked
tasted
ordinary
i
feel
like
i
can
purchase
a
beer
of
this
quality
at
a
far
cheaper
price
poured
a
lighter
color
and
more
cloudy
than
i
expected
it
also
seems
like
the
hops
overpower
other
flavors
which
might
be
present
in
the
beer
d
one
22oz
is
plenty
a
sipper
for
sure
d
ok
one
glass
is
good
hideous
red
plumes
of
malted
citrus
smooth
easy
drinking
heavy
and
chewy
malts
still
a
huge
hop
presence
though
not
overly
bitter
big
alcohols
still
reside
in
this
ridiculous
ale
still
a
bit
fusel
definitely
my
favorite
strong
ale
and
quite
a
doosey
at
that
just
drink
a
bomber
like
me
and
youll
know
why
stone
hits
another
one
out
of
the
park
their
irs
is
definitely
my
favorite
beer
and
this
one
is
right
up
there
keep
em
comin
stone
a
great
offering
from
stone
that
gets
better
each
year
keep
those
aggressive
bastards
coming
thanks
again
petesuphi
for
unlocking
a
3
liter
mega
bastard
drinkability
i
always
enjoy
this
when
i
can
get
it
and
have
another
2010
aging
to
see
how
it
mellows
even
though
i
like
the
boozy
heat
solid
drinkability
i
think
this
will
do
great
with
some
age
and
im
gonna
find
out
drinkability
probably
a
sipper
youll
notice
the
high
abv
but
one
i
wouldnt
mind
sipping
all
night
cheers

50
as
stated
on
ba
pours
a
brackish
brownish
auburn
color
with
a
good
sized
head
nice
lacing
i
may
be
crazy
but
this
beer
smells
like
banana
bread
with
booze
in
it
the
taste
is
boozey
with
some
hops
not
only
does
it
smell
like
alcoholic
banana
bread
but
it
tastes
like
it
as
well
this
beer
has
that
alcohol
burn
to
it
but
it
still
has
a
nice
drinkability
this
is
another
solid
beer
from
stone
and
i
look
forward
to
aging
one
of
these
to
see
how
itll
taste
down
the
road
a
fantastic
brew
that
i
would
certainly
pick
up
again
d
a
very
impressive
brew
i
must
get
this
one
again
little
heavier
than
medium
bodied
the
creamy
texture
seems
offbase
but
not
problematic
a
belgian
kind
of
smooth
carbonation
still
not
at
all
easygoing
2010
release
from
a
bottle
bought
while
on
a
trip
to
california
a
very
fine
brew
to
me
the
balance
between
hopinessmaltinessalcohol
was
extremely
good
do
not
drink
quickly
savor
it
on
my
next
trip
to
california
i
will
definitely
buy
again
cheers
d
you
definitely
feel
the
alcohol
percentage
on
this
beer
one
pint
and
i
could
feel
it
slightly
but
i
will
have
a
few
more
of
this
until
the
keg
is
tapped
i
have
a
bottle
here
at
home
that
i
hope
will
age
well
over
the
next
few
months
to
a
year
fuller
body
but
very
smooth
and
easy
on
the
tongue
carbonation
is
lighter
and
even
though
this
is
still
boozy
its
not
quite
as
hot
as
i
expected
this
beer
is
nice
with
some
age
on
it
but
this
reminded
me
how
tasty
it
is
fresh
as
well
one
of
the
more
balanced
beers
stone
makes
that
said
it
quite
rich
and
a
little
sweet
and
i
dont
think
i
could
have
more
than
a
glass
maybe
i
just
dont
like
the
flavor
profile
maybe
this
is
just
too
much
sweet
caramel
malt
for
me
but
i
do
not
love
this
beer
i
can
appreciate
that
it
is
a
quality
brew
but
its
just
not
for
me
and
i
have
to
say
i
am
a
little
surprised
by
how
high
this
beer
rates
that
said
i
have
tried
some
vintage
bottles
and
i
loved
them
j
this
ale
is
recommended
for
aging
and
i
sure
as
hell
will
if
i
can
get
another

pours
a
murky
brownish
mahogany
with
a
loose
foamy
tancolored
head
embedded
with
tiny
pinpricks
big
malty
nose
figs
prunes
molasses
and
brown
sugar
taste
follows
nose
with
the
addition
of
a
cocoa
character
some
alcohol
astringency
and
an
earthy
quality
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
with
a
mild
even
carbonation
i
have
to
say
that
this
beer
has
really
held
up
well
the
alcohol
is
dangerously
wellhidden
on
this
beer
this
might
be
my
favorite
stone
offering
to
date
d
i
enjoyed
this
far
more
than
the
regular
aba
but
be
warned
of
the
higher
abv
i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
highly
recommend
it
drinkability
i
will
admit
i
had
a
couple
before
this
however
it
is
not
as
alcoholic
as
i
would
have
assumed
relatively
easy
to
drink
i
have
a
2008
of
this
and
can
only
assume
it
will
be
damn
amazing
full
creamy
mouthfeel
with
average
carbonation
drinkability
is
soso
just
do
to
the
big
and
taxing
nature
of
this
beer
one
per
sitting
is
enough
d
the
hops
are
strong
enough
to
slow
you
down
and
while
not
harsh
in
your
mouth
the
alcohol
lets
you
know
its
there
that
said
its
delicious
enough
that
your
tolerance
is
a
more
likely
bottleneck
than
your
palate
verdict
its
in
your
face
xxx
rated
hops
and
malt
that
isnt
cheap
or
easy
drinking
therfore
its
a
must
find
d
extremely
easy
drinker
the
time
in
the
cellar
really
mellowed
this
one
out
to
the
point
that
it
drinks
like
a
fine
wine
and
less
like
the
younger
bastards
pours
a
very
dark
ruby
with
a
finger
an
a
half
of
tan
head
the
nose
is
as
expected
dark
fruits
sweet
malts
some
hops
reminds
me
of
an
american
barleywine
tastes
a
lot
like
the
nose
malty
dark
fruits
dates
with
a
bitter
finish
you
can
taste
the
alcohol
for
sure
but
its
not
too
overpowering
imo
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
chewy
sticky
on
the
lips
and
drinkability
is
medium
obviously
this
beer
is
designed
to
cellar
but
i
wanted
to
try
it
really
fresh
an
its
pretty
potent
but
also
very
good
d
maybe
in
5
years
it
will
make
sense
chess
not
checkers
ill
revisit
this
a
few
times
over
the
next
years
and
see
if
it
makes
a
difference
this
beer
is
an
event
in
itself
i
love
stone
but
god
i
hate
dr
pepper
while
this
is
quite
enjoyable
the
slightly
thicker
mouthfeel
and
high
abv
make
this
one
more
of
a
sipper
mouthfeel
was
thick
and
full
bodied
and
was
well
carbonated
it
is
fairly
drinkable
but
this
beverage
demands
to
be
enjoyed
slowly
i
am
not
worthy
but
i
certainly
enjoy
trying
highly
drinkable
absolutely
delicous
may
have
to
buy
this
again
drinkabilty
its
so
intense
and
strong
this
22oz
is
more
then
enough
i
could
enjoy
this
weekly
though
you
have
to
sip
it
therefor
drinkabilty
is
dropped
down
some
all
three
bastards
are
great
and
offer
something
differnt
this
for
sure
is
the
big
brother
what
a
beer
you
dont
have
to
be
a
double
bastard
to
try
this
beer
but
you
do
have
to
be
a
double
hop
and
malt
head
this
beer
had
me
at
smell
hello
what
great
head
retention
and
aroma
super
powerful
11
but
after
two
drinks
it
flows
like
niagra
falls
there
are
so
many
flavors
smells
aromas
going
on
that
it
is
a
circus
of
sensations
cant
believe
i
waited
so
long
to
try
it
im
hooked
drinkability
this
beer
packs
a
lot
of
things
into
a
bottle
and
does
each
of
them
well
all
the
disparate
elements
the
nutty
and
caramel
maltiness
accompanied
by
a
hops
cameo
that
appears
in
the
latter
parts
of
the
swig
are
tied
together
ingeniously
i
have
come
to
expect
the
world
from
all
releases
of
double
bastard
and
i
have
yet
to
be
disappointed
as
of
this
review
i
have
enjoyed
the
03
09
and
2010
drinkability
is
a
bit
low
in
this
with
the
alcohol
being
present
and
the
ridiculous
bitterness
from
the
hops
definitely
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
d
this
is
not
for
the
faint
of
hearti
can
not
wait
see
to
how
the
ones
i
am
cellaring
will
be
next
year
pours
a
hazy
mahogany
with
ruby
highlights
and
a
thin
tan
head
that
leaves
nice
lacing
the
aroma
is
all
grapefruit
and
piney
hops
upfront
along
with
some
orange
marmalade
caramel
toffee
dark
fruits
cocoa
vanilla
oak
and
some
alcohol
really
fresh
and
inviting
aroma
the
flavor
is
similar
with
a
big
citrusy
and
piney
hop
punch
initially
along
with
caramel
toffee
toasted
bread
some
vanilla
and
oak
dark
fruits
orange
marmalade
and
some
alcohol
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
rich
and
drinkability
is
very
good
considering
the
abv
this
is
a
particularly
tasty
iteration
of
double
bastard
easily
my
favorite
of
the
last
few
years
with
an
amazing
aroma
and
better
drinkability
overall
i
prefer
db09
to
this
years
release
but
i
already
cant
wait
until
2011
2010
vintage
on
tap
last
night
at
fresh
craft
in
downtown
denver
poured
a
rich
dark
amber
color
with
a
substantial
amount
of
medium
tan
foam
on
top
sweet
malty
aroma
with
floral
hops
dried
fruits
and
alcohol
on
the
palate
relatively
full
bodied
and
very
sweet
almost
cloying
with
more
floral
hops
chocolate
and
booze
not
bad
needs
some
time
to
dry
out
a
bit
and
come
together
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
however
im
not
sure
if
i
enjoy
it
more
than
regular
arrogant
bastard
there
is
more
booze
flavoring
on
the
tongue
than
i
would
prefer
but
i
cant
complain
about
the
other
flavors
im
tasting
id
probably
buy
this
again
if
given
the
opportunity
jake
glad
i
tried
this
but
i
prefer
oab
or
ab
the
high
alcohol
only
adds
a
warming
note
on
the
finish
but
the
heaviness
of
this
brew
makes
it
a
definite
sipper
the
hop
presence
while
not
overly
bitter
is
intense
enough
to
keep
the
sweetness
in
check
i
stuck
a
couple
bottles
in
the
basement
and
will
be
interested
to
see
whether
the
flavors
still
balance
as
the
hops
mellow
overall
this
beer
is
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
when
its
fresh
at
least
if
you
are
a
hop
monster
and
want
a
big
boy
check
this
guy
out
if
you
want
more
of
a
balanced
barleywineamerican
strong
ale
offering
you
can
still
enjoy
this
i
would
just
cellar
for
a
year
or
so
overall
an
excellent
beer
that
i
may
consider
buying
a
case
of
before
it
runs
out
for
the
year
in
my
opinion
this
is
a
perfectly
balance
high
gravity
beer
d
very
well
balanced
and
carbonated
abv
is
well
masked
which
makes
this
ale
very
enjoyable
i
highly
recommend
it
the
beer
appears
a
russet
brown
with
subtle
crimson
highlights
the
head
is
substantial
in
stature
and
leaves
plenty
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
alcohol
malts
and
toffee
the
hop
character
of
the
beer
has
faded
during
the
aging
process
so
i
am
not
detecting
any
of
the
fruit
hop
pineapple
or
citrus
flavors
i
have
been
told
are
well
associated
with
double
bastard
ale
the
feel
is
thick
and
syrupy
with
a
strong
alcohol
presence
throughout
i
liked
this
much
better
than
the
stone
old
guardian
2007
we
had
alongside
this
this
is
a
great
beer
to
share
a
few
ways
and
sip
slowly
on
a
cold
night
great
beer
rereview
of
the
2010
version
fresh
off
the
shelf
nothing
new
to
report
here
just
as
lovely
as
ever
do
damn
for
10
5abv
this
drinks
incredible
i
want
to
drink
this
faster
than
i
should
wow
props
to
finnegans
in
plainfield
il
for
shooting
for
the
most
arrogant
bar
in
america
2
vintage
double
bastard
pints
yeah
i
travelled
2
hours
for
this
overall
this
beer
is
quite
delicious
i
very
much
enjoyed
drinking
it
it
is
balanced
strong
not
cloying
and
has
some
unique
flavors
that
keep
things
interesting
di
enjoyed
this
it
would
be
much
more
drinkable
if
i
could
get
my
hands
on
it
other
than
in
november
each
year
contemplating
hoarding
this
d
high
for
the
abv
and
you
have
to
throw
stone
out
a
bonus
point
for
keeping
it
under
7
bones
a
bomber
5bitchs
jyeah
mouthfeel
is
chewy
and
thick
overall
stone
has
another
quality
brew
here
lots
of
great
things
going
on
here
but
it
will
be
interesting
to
see
how
this
one
ages
ddefinitely
arrogant
this
beer
demands
to
be
consumed
and
appreciated
slowly
pour
it
cold
and
observe
the
change
from
hopdominated
to
maltdominated
as
it
warms
this
beer
has
aged
beautifully
the
aggressive
nature
of
this
beer
is
tamed
way
down
and
the
alcohol
has
dialed
itself
back
the
heat
is
still
there
just
more
subtle
the
caramel
notes
come
through
prominently
as
before
but
it
has
started
to
morph
into
toffee
overall
if
you
can
afford
to
cellar
a
few
i
would
recommend
it
i
really
like
this
beer
22oz
bombers
typically
available
for
2
months
buy
a
lot
of
them
drink
and
cellar
them
great
off
the
shelf
for
a
hop
fan
terrific
out
of
the
cellar
the
flavors
really
open
up
hops
die
off
and
the
barley
comes
through
i
always
enjoy
getting
a
new
batch
and
comparing
it
to
the
last
year
this
beer
is
a
lot
like
the
original
ab
except
its
just
bigger
in
every
way
and
its
more
slanted
towards
the
hops
the
hops
are
sharper
the
mouthfeel
is
thicker
the
malts
are
bigger
albeit
not
as
much
of
a
difference
as
the
hops
and
the
booze
shows
more
so
between
the
two
i
would
probably
find
myself
drinking
the
original
ab
more
often
than
this
d
drinks
great
if
you
can
hang
with
it
definitely
a
hop
head
connoisseur
type
ale
with
lots
of
bite
and
cringe
i
like
it
drinks
similar
to
a
barley
wine
if
i
taste
tested
it
blindfold
i
would
call
it
one
thumbs
way
up
this
is
one
hot
ale
double
bastard
has
more
of
an
ipa
feel
for
me
the
hoppiness
is
likely
the
culprit
here
pours
an
amber
orange
color
with
an
off
white
foam
head
has
an
nice
aroma
of
caramel
citrus
and
pine
great
medium
body
the
maltiness
here
works
perfectly
to
balance
with
the
bitters
love
it
d
the
alcohol
only
showed
itself
now
and
then
flavorwise
but
left
a
warm
finish
constantly
which
was
nice
this
isnt
my
favorite
but
a
very
well
crafted
beer
nonetheless
the
beer
is
am
ambercopper
color
with
cream
head
the
smell
has
a
strong
alcohol
and
hop
scent
smooth
beer
you
can
taste
the
grapefruit
and
pineapple
alt
with
the
hops
sugar
caramel
and
slight
chocolate
notes
this
beer
gets
better
and
more
comlex
as
it
warms
great
beer
almost
perfection
d
overall
its
a
stone
beer
for
sure
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
i
will
savor
this
one
slowly
as
i
finish
the
bomber
had
at
the
stone
tap
takeover
in
charlotte
2006
vintage
served
from
tap
into
a
tumbler
poured
a
deep
redorange
with
a
minimal
offwhite
head
maintained
nice
lacing
throughout
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
and
a
slight
hop
character
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
and
a
subtle
bitter
hop
note
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
mild
carboation
overall
this
brew
really
seemed
to
mellow
out
with
the
aging
everything
was
nice
and
smooth
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
quite
a
bit
and
it
has
motivated
me
to
age
some
the
next
time
i
can
find
it
in
stores
d
delicious
and
better
than
the
single
bastard
abv
is
only
drawback
skål
d
a
very
good
solid
strong
ale
some
nice
caramel
malts
and
dark
fruit
in
the
nose
and
taste
would
like
to
have
again
fresh
to
compare
d
this
is
a
very
good
brew
but
it
almost
becomes
a
chore
to
drink
taste
is
malty
and
a
bit
boozy
but
thats
to
be
expected
its
very
rich
and
complex
with
a
fairly
solid
hop
profile
its
got
a
light
and
sharp
mouthfeel
very
tasty
d
a
sipper
for
sure
not
as
aggressive
and
assertive
with
a
year
on
this
beer
i
think
i
like
this
beer
better
fresh
when
the
hops
attack
and
the
malt
follows
i
do
enjoy
the
mellowed
out
version
but
would
really
like
to
see
what
some
serious
age
does
to
this
beer
as
i
think
it
could
hold
up
the
beer
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
very
nice
i
get
a
ton
of
citrus
hop
character
with
a
lot
of
caramel
malt
and
alcohol
the
flavor
is
pretty
bitter
with
a
lot
of
juicy
orange
citrus
and
pine
notes
the
caramel
malt
is
present
in
the
flavor
but
doesnt
cut
the
bitterness
too
much
the
alcohol
is
also
present
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
thick
and
is
very
sticky
medium
carbonation
drinkability
based
on
taste
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
based
on
alc
percentage
i
could
only
have
a
couple
of
these
this
is
a
very
big
beer
drinkability
a
great
beer
however
i
would
not
have
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
i
am
definitely
looking
forward
to
trying
one
agin
though
i
liked
this
but
one
glass
is
enough
that
abv
really
takes
a
toll
would
go
well
with
bbq
or
an
earthy
cheese
mfd
no
lingering
feelings
in
the
mouth
flavors
dissipate
quickly
making
the
tongue
thirst
for
more
thank
you
sir
may
i
have
another
overall
i
really
liked
this
beer
i
had
been
unable
to
find
it
when
it
came
out
but
happened
upon
a
bottle
of
it
while
buying
other
beer
in
a
local
store
so
i
knew
i
had
to
pick
it
up
it
is
very
good
and
ill
be
stocking
up
on
bottles
to
age
if
i
find
any
new
ones
in
the
future
it
was
definitely
worth
the
wait
and
proves
why
stone
brewing
remains
my
favorite
brewery
this
beer
means
business
im
a
fan
of
the
arrogant
bastard
and
this
bigger
brother
makes
a
decent
mark
cant
have
too
many
of
these
but
a
must
try
this
doesnt
quite
blow
me
away
as
for
the
style
or
strong
ale
but
it
certainly
fills
out
the
stone
lineup
nicely
for
a
single
drink
i
would
probably
look
elsewhere
with
a
bit
of
mellowing
again
this
could
be
an
exceptionally
outofthis
world
beer
d
well
it
took
me
the
better
part
of
two
hours
to
drink
this
behemoth
so
im
not
sure
how
drinkable
is
really
is
but
do
know
this
its
damned
good
and
i
really
enjoyed
exploring
its
nuances
this
is
going
on
my
favorites
list
mouthfeel
is
beautifully
smooth
and
fullbodied
considerably
more
than
original
ab
considerable
bitterness
towards
the
end
but
not
too
overpowering
drinkability
is
a
bit
moderate
especially
for
how
bitter
and
boozy
it
is
it
might
be
rough
for
some
people
and
yet
desirable
for
others
a
totally
different
monster
from
ab
really
worth
a
try
nonetheless
a
super
beer
super
satisfying
obviously
some
people
wont
like
this
because
of
how
busy
it
is
but
i
recommend
it
to
all
even
if
you
dont
like
it
itll
be
quite
the
experience
just
dont
pour
it
down
the
drain
pass
it
on
to
a
friend
instead
d
still
drinkable
for
how
rich
it
is
this
strong
ale
is
double
the
bastard
to
you
when
the
bottle
is
finished
im
sure
a
nice
beer
with
good
profiles
going
on
here
very
similar
traits
to
an
american
barley
wine
bold
yes
intense
sure
sublime
extacy
i
dont
know
if
id
go
that
far
nevertheless
its
something
of
a
force
with
which
to
reckon
d
i
clearly
couldnt
polish
off
two
of
these
behemoth
bottles
but
id
probably
be
reaching
for
another
after
i
finished
a
bomber
of
this
d
no
hint
of
the
increased
abv
overall
a
fantastic
beer
that
definitely
oneups
the
regular
arrogant
bastard
no
problem
polishing
off
the
bomber
myself
fairly
quickly
big
sweet
malt
fills
the
aroma
theres
carmel
and
dark
fruits
it
ends
with
some
pine
aroma
from
the
hops
the
flavor
starts
off
sweet
malty
and
viscous
matching
the
aroma
and
its
followed
by
huge
hop
flavor
and
bitterness
lots
of
pine
comes
through
and
the
bitterness
is
strong
after
that
it
dries
right
up
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
the
carbonation
is
moderately
low
and
fits
well
with
the
beer
overall
i
really
like
this
beer
it
is
surprisingly
drinkable
for
its
size
its
a
strong
beer
which
i
enjoyed
but
would
i
say
its
very
drinkable
not
quite
overall
its
a
solid
beer
and
i
would
get
it
again
for
sure
d
just
plays
off
of
the
mouthfeel
i
want
to
drink
this
but
im
not
digging
the
mouthfeel
taste
is
nice
smell
is
great
just
isnt
doing
it
for
me
of
course
did
try
to
put
back
the
full
bottle
in
one
sitting
maybe
the
label
is
right
d
hard
to
drink
this
beer
at
almost
11
it
is
rather
apparent
in
the
heat
of
this
beer
and
too
viscous
drop
this
beer
down
due
to
those
facts
d
i
very
much
enjoy
arrogant
bastard
and
i
really
enjoy
this
drink
the
alcohol
isnt
masked
as
much
however
the
flavors
make
up
for
it
great
beer
for
a
colder
night
to
bad
its
still
90
degrees
outside
the
taste
is
an
excellent
blend
of
hops
caramellike
maltiness
and
bitterness
i
love
the
balance
in
this
beer
it
is
definitely
a
sticky
heavy
sipper
but
it
is
drinkable
for
what
it
is
i
cant
wait
to
try
the
oaked
version
of
this
when
i
can
find
it
medium
heavy
body
and
good
bubbles
booziness
and
sourness
makes
it
a
little
tough
to
drink
much
of
this
guy
drinkability
good
hops
nice
aroma
medium
to
full
body
was
expecting
a
little
more
but
im
having
trouble
finding
it
i
wasnt
really
blown
away
with
the
double
bastard
as
opposed
to
the
standard
arrogant
bastard
dstrong
in
the
booze
department
but
pretty
drinakble
unusual
and
oddly
addictive
ive
enjoyed
this
fresh
and
aged
alike
it
just
depends
on
what
tickles
your
fancy
i
do
not
feel
so
all
alone
murky
brown
pour
with
little
head
nice
american
hop
aromas
some
pine
and
grapefruit
some
sweetness
quite
bitter
lots
of
american
hops
in
the
taste
a
short
sweetness
to
balance
it
all
but
the
high
abv
is
still
being
felt
thick
and
heavy
mouthfeel
this
is
a
little
too
much
for
me
i
prefer
the
regular
and
less
bitter
arrogant
bastard
ale
md
the
abv
does
not
go
unnoticed
and
as
such
this
is
not
something
to
drink
for
an
entire
evening
d
actually
is
a
very
nice
sweet
hop
brew
that
is
pretty
drinkable
but
does
pack
a
punch
i
just
had
a
2000
vintage
double
bastard
and
it
tasted
like
a
barleywine
so
you
can
sit
on
it
for
a
decade
and
it
will
still
taste
good
what
a
great
beer
i
am
going
to
stock
up
and
have
some
for
this
fall
when
it
turns
cool
d
this
is
one
bigass
beer
ive
tasted
a
lot
of
double
ipas
that
tasted
like
barleywines
and
quite
a
few
barleywines
that
ventured
into
dipa
territory
but
this
is
the
only
one
that
really
manages
to
be
both
at
once
significantly
different
from
arrogant
bastard
but
theyre
definitely
cut
from
the
same
cloth
a
fruity
bombastically
hopped
strong
ale
that
is
definitely
worthy
very
dangerous
1
5
liters
later
it
still
goes
down
just
as
smooth
if
not
smoother
than
it
did
at
the
beginning
splitting
a
3
liter
during
a
lotr
marathon
is
quite
sneaky
edit
had
a
fresh
22oz
bottle
in
2010
and
its
more
hoppy
fresh
but
just
as
potent
and
aggressive
an
extremely
flavorful
and
drinkable
beer
22oz
bottle
opened
at
local
beer
tasting
underground
bluz
a
beautiful
brew
the
only
beer
all
night
that
everyone
at
the
table
liked
hopheads
and
malt
lovers
alike
sweet
and
tasty
up
front
with
roasty
malt
flavor
a
very
nice
hop
finish
this
beer
can
do
some
damage
because
you
wont
want
to
stop
drinking
it
overall
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
enjoyed
can
feel
this
one
after
only
one
22
oz
bottle
due
to
the
conent
but
i
wanted
much
more
very
dangerous
beer
ive
worked
this
first
glass
down
quite
quickly
and
im
surprised
im
not
really
feeling
it
alcohol
content
wise
this
will
never
be
drinkable
but
its
role
in
the
flavor
is
extremely
well
integrated
already
not
the
best
beer
ive
ever
had
but
it
is
tops
in
my
book
and
for
a
fair
price
with
good
availability
a
definite
recommend
and
remember
ive
seen
this
one
just
about
everywere
i
go
now
finally
decided
to
try
and
rate
pours
thick
and
has
a
lingering
head
dark
brown
in
complexity
with
plenty
of
carbonation
showing
there
is
a
sweet
malty
aroma
with
hint
of
hops
i
also
get
hint
of
leather
and
mushrooms
starts
off
sweet
on
the
pellet
and
wham
you
get
hit
with
the
hops
and
the
alcohol
in
a
good
way
taste
like
a
barly
wine
very
enjoyable
09
version
d
abv
is
10
50
and
you
can
feel
it
everything
in
this
beer
is
turned
up
to
10
sit
back
and
enjoy
notes
vintage
2007
a
very
enjoyable
beer
to
drink
with
flavor
jumping
out
and
being
very
strong
but
the
balance
between
malt
sweetness
and
hop
bitterness
was
nice
again
not
sure
how
it
would
be
fresh
i
would
definitely
recommend
trying
this
very
flavorful
beer
this
is
barleywine
meets
the
massive
hop
attack
of
an
american
strong
ale
hard
to
see
this
as
drinkable
though
i
imagine
with
some
significant
time
in
the
cellar
it
might
be
you
can
see
the
genius
in
the
melding
of
such
mass
quantities
of
malt
and
hops
but
at
this
point
its
still
too
rough
unbalanced
and
just
plain
ol
brutish
for
me
d
i
enjoyed
trying
this
beer
but
to
me
the
overall
sum
was
not
as
good
as
the
pieces
most
likely
a
one
and
done
i
love
this
beer
it
reaches
up
and
punches
you
in
the
face
and
makes
no
apologies
thoroughly
enjoyable
and
ill
be
very
very
sad
when
this
keg
kicks
nicely
carbonated
and
having
a
texture
that
is
oily
but
also
somewhat
creamy
it
should
go
down
smooth
but
it
is
just
overwhelming
although
the
alcohol
is
certainly
present
and
noticeable
especially
as
the
beer
warms
the
booziness
is
not
the
biggest
obstacle
to
drinkability
rather
it
is
the
combination
of
big
hop
bitterness
dense
malt
sweetness
and
the
high
alcohol
that
just
overloads
the
palate
i
thought
i
liked
big
flavors
as
much
as
the
next
guy
but
the
abundance
of
everything
packed
into
the
double
bastard
is
just
too
much
poured
with
a
huge
foamy
frothy
light
tan
head
and
lots
of
lace
color
is
a
clear
copper
amber
aroma
is
malt
hop
roast
flavor
is
like
aroma
with
big
hops
and
bitter
over
sweet
good
body
and
carboantion
huge
tang
on
the
tongue
from
bitterness
ditto
for
the
finish
and
some
alcohol
warming
pretty
good
beer
but
a
little
overdone
on
the
bitterness
not
a
session
d
this
is
another
enjoyable
beer
from
stone
its
very
drinkable
in
the
sense
of
enjoying
a
well
crafted
am
strong
when
you
think
of
that
style
of
beer
double
bastard
is
the
one
that
has
the
little
exponent
in
the
top
right
corner
taking
it
to
the
umpteenth
power
good
brew
just
watch
that
10
5
dtoo
drinkable
for
a
beer
this
potent
overall
a
enjoyable
beer
that
has
huge
flavor
and
huge
everything
about
this
beer
is
huge
cheers
to
stone
for
going
all
out
you
can
tell
its
not
a
cheap
beer
to
make
full
bodied
and
slightly
thick
smooth
an
with
very
little
carbonation
its
really
appropriate
though
drinkability
is
excellent
d
this
is
a
big
beer
that
goes
down
easy
there
is
almost
no
trace
of
the
10
5
abv
finishing
a
22
oz
bomber
is
not
an
issue
this
is
not
a
beer
i
would
want
to
drink
all
the
time
but
will
keep
it
around
just
for
when
i
feel
like
i
went
a
big
smooth
bitter
ale
another
stone
release
that
i
will
purchase
a
few
bottles
of
every
year
i
can
only
imagine
my
score
on
this
one
would
increase
with
some
age
on
it
as
the
alcohol
bite
fades
and
the
malt
comes
through
a
bit
more
d
a
fantastic
sipping
beer
could
i
drink
it
all
night
absolutely
not
and
that
wouldnt
be
good
for
me
anyway
but
its
extremely
complex
and
rewarding
something
id
like
to
have
on
hand
at
all
times
for
the
occasional
reward
this
is
a
big
beer
that
will
blow
your
mind
i
would
not
pound
this
fast
if
the
sun
is
setting
in
your
neck
of
the
woods
and
you
have
a
good
view
pour
this
slow
and
enjoy
it
slow
at
the
same
time
i
feel
like
going
out
right
now
and
finding
another
bottle
that
i
can
age
for
3
years
to
have
the
experience
all
over
again
i
can
think
of
only
one
other
beer
that
has
been
such
an
exceptional
experience
as
this
one
and
thats
the
first
release
of
rogue
brewers
ale
on
tap
at
the
source
other
than
that
nothing
really
comes
close
pours
a
copper
brown
color
that
was
very
cloudy
with
spare
off
white
head
and
spare
lacing
had
a
bit
of
a
burnt
flavor
with
hints
of
carmel
malts
light
perfume
hop
like
taste
and
maybe
some
oak
flavor
as
well
full
body
with
a
lively
to
average
texture
sour
bitter
finish
this
beer
is
certainly
not
for
the
weak
so
proceed
with
caution
will
most
certainly
drink
again
very
good
not
sure
if
it
quite
lived
up
to
the
hype
very
delicious
none
the
less
d
this
seems
stronger
than
labeled
abvwise
it
could
easily
catch
up
to
you
but
sometimes
that
is
exactly
the
point
overall
fantastic
simply
fantastic
this
is
a
beer
that
i
would
not
consume
on
a
casual
basis
it
is
also
not
a
summers
day
thirst
quencher
this
is
a
beer
you
face
with
the
intent
of
experiencing
the
flavor
panorama
you
must
enter
a
dialog
with
this
beer
in
order
to
reap
full
satisfaction
from
this
beer
you
must
enjoy
it
while
sober
final
thoughts
this
is
my
brew
of
choice
when
it
is
in
season
on
tap
growlers
or
bottles
i
havent
had
a
bad
experience
with
db
as
my
brother
said
this
beer
is
rocking
my
fucking
world
sinfully
syrupy
feel
almost
a
chewy
quality
about
this
ale
has
major
alcohol
warmth
once
in
the
mouth
and
ingested
almost
warming
like
a
shot
of
bourbon
whiskey
though
not
quite
very
sticky
and
sweet
feeling
on
the
palate
this
brew
has
good
drinkability
due
to
the
incredible
flavour
and
very
unique
characteristics
there
may
be
a
need
to
keep
yourself
in
check
due
to
the
outrageous
alcohol
percentage
but
other
than
that
there
is
a
struggle
to
find
fault
with
this
ale
truly
top
notch
in
my
book
seek
this
one
out
and
destroy
it
or
it
may
destroy
you
it
is
hard
to
drink
this
beer
plainly
put
but
that
isnt
a
bad
thing
the
plentiful
flavors
keep
you
coming
back
for
more
this
is
a
very
unique
brew
this
is
an
unbelievable
beer
with
great
balance
and
tons
of
character
no
one
characteristic
dominates
another
and
the
alcohol
is
buried
in
fact
if
not
for
the
high
abv
i
could
drink
this
all
night
d
only
a
pint
for
me
glad
to
share
the
20
oz
its
enjoyable
and
i
would
try
again
drinkabilitythis
beer
is
10
50
but
i
swear
if
my
tolerance
would
allow
it
i
could
drink
this
like
it
was
only
5
its
that
unreal
in
its
drinkability
for
this
abv
i
need
to
update
this
i
had
another
beer
after
this
amazingly
because
it
is
so
strong
but
it
is
a
decent
beer
i
rated
it
a
b
and
after
the
double
bastard
it
tastes
like
water
amazing
i
could
be
drunk
but
i
think
it
is
a
combo
of
it
being
so
good
and
so
strong
try
this
beer
this
beer
has
a
flavor
profile
that
original
bastard
couldnt
even
come
close
to
touching
you
are
first
greeted
with
sweet
maltcaramel
flavors
followed
by
an
extremely
well
balanced
hoppy
finish
which
almost
has
a
sweet
whisky
like
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
is
near
perfection
not
to
carbonated
and
the
silky
smooth
thickness
that
ive
come
to
love
in
stone
brews
i
dont
get
how
someone
could
put
this
beer
down
it
is
a
perfectly
balanced
roller
coaster
of
flavors
if
you
see
one
buy
it
before
i
do
this
beer
drinks
like
its
slightly
less
arrogant
sibling
which
can
lead
to
trouble
with
abv
in
the
double
digits
luckily
there
is
a
bit
of
booziness
that
gives
a
bit
of
warming
or
maybe
warning
to
the
fuzziness
that
can
come
from
this
bomber
this
beer
should
be
available
all
year
round
but
then
i
would
never
buy
regular
ab
again
d
this
is
a
sipper
and
has
a
heavy
body
which
makes
drinking
it
a
slow
process
the
flavors
are
bold
and
intense
and
lean
a
little
to
heavily
towards
the
sweet
end
of
the
spectrum
for
my
liking
all
in
all
another
interesting
beer
from
stone
holee
shit
this
may
be
the
best
and
most
unique
smelling
beer
ive
had
yet
huge
fruit
tones
rich
persimmon
and
plum
color
is
clear
dark
red
with
an
almost
caramel
head
taste
is
total
creeper
that
fades
ohsoprovocatively
huge
brown
sugar
malt
front
into
a
spicy
cinnamonlike
hops
base
that
fades
into
a
puff
pastry
filled
with
alcohol
glorious
and
radical
only
regret
is
the
alcohol
tinge
aftereffect
overall
impression
very
close
to
a
barleywine
in
style
absolutely
amazing
beer
in
flavor
strength
and
complexity
and
if
i
have
not
stated
it
publicly
before
stone
has
far
and
away
the
best
labels
graphics
and
arrogant
attitude
in
the
brewing
world
having
said
that
this
beer
is
nectar
of
the
mother
fucking
godz
this
beer
pours
with
the
most
beautiful
colors
of
orangishred
it
recieved
a
perfect
5
look
just
does
not
get
any
better
than
this
the
smell
is
something
to
be
noted
as
well
big
nose
even
on
a
cold
night
that
lets
the
consumer
know
that
this
is
a
well
hopped
beer
and
you
can
smell
the
malt
backing
as
well
the
taste
is
of
big
pine
hops
that
transitions
into
a
malty
sweetnessflawless
this
beer
is
a
must
seek
for
those
who
have
not
had
the
priviledge
of
consuming
this
fine
beer
another
great
brew
from
stone
d
very
drinkable
beer
aside
from
the
10
5
abv
which
catches
up
to
you
quickly
i
really
enjoyed
the
balance
of
this
beer
and
the
lively
flavorful
hops
i
will
definitely
have
to
hunt
this
one
down
again
soon
thick
mouthfeel
but
decent
carb
and
the
balance
makes
this
beer
very
drinkable
i
am
not
a
fan
at
all
i
like
to
think
i
can
appreciate
a
bitter
hop
bomb
even
though
it
is
not
my
style
though
this
is
just
overly
bitter
and
tons
of
hot
alcohol
any
brewery
can
make
an
overly
bitter
beer
with
way
to
much
alcohol
this
a
prime
example
if
it
is
your
thing
fine
it
is
not
mine
d
for
being
over
10
i
feel
that
the
drinkability
is
pretty
high
not
really
sure
if
i
liked
this
one
at
first
especially
considering
the
high
rankings
on
ba
but
the
more
i
let
it
resonate
i
really
liked
it
mouthfeel
full
body
with
soft
carbonation
and
smooth
to
drink
overall
excellent
beer
overall
i
would
highly
recommend
trying
this
this
is
one
monster
of
a
beer
one
of
the
best
ive
had
in
a
while
d
this
beer
is
so
good
i
had
to
have
two
couldnt
risk
the
keg
kicking
before
i
got
a
chance
to
indulge
for
the
second
time
a
real
treat
from
stone
a
brewery
that
i
am
not
whole
heartedly
fond
of
one
of
if
not
their
best
offering
in
my
opinion
i
need
this
beer
at
my
disposal
i
plan
on
buying
some
bottles
so
that
i
can
age
them
myself
and
i
recommend
anyone
reading
this
review
do
the
same
d
i
wasnt
really
feeling
this
one
maybe
i
should
try
it
again
sometime
but
it
was
just
to
sweet
and
syrupy
the
style
says
it
all
this
is
one
strong
ale
be
respectful
with
this
one
it
wont
be
long
before
that
10
5
abv
kicks
in
stone
never
ceases
to
impress
my
palate
may
be
a
little
challenged
as
this
reminds
me
a
lot
of
arrogant
bastard
almost
to
the
point
of
being
interchangeable
with
it
and
no
bad
thing
seeing
as
i
have
that
an
a
although
this
one
made
me
really
thirsty
i
think
its
just
that
little
bit
heavier
and
well
better
but
id
be
just
as
happy
with
either
just
so
were
clear
overall
a
very
bitter
yet
drinkable
beer
even
though
i
bought
it
over
2
months
ago
the
bitter
floral
hops
really
hit
the
tounge
this
beer
is
challenging
full
of
a
ton
of
ingredients
but
its
good
but
oh
so
warming
2009
bottle
the
coppermahogany
color
of
a
used
penny
thick
stiff
offwhite
head
good
retention
and
lacing
whiffs
of
tropical
fruits
and
pine
backed
by
sweet
toffee
and
carmely
malts
brandy
and
fusel
alcohol
notes
on
the
back
end
taste
up
front
is
bitter
and
pungent
piney
and
tropicalcitrus
hops
the
next
taste
is
a
big
boozy
taste
almost
that
of
a
cheap
unaged
brandy
very
fusely
the
malts
are
very
nice
sweet
and
nutty
but
covered
up
by
the
booze
big
bodied
sticky
chewey
but
manages
to
be
smooth
dunno
how
to
explain
it
nice
big
bold
beer
with
big
bold
flavors
but
couldnt
overcome
the
offboozy
flavors
probably
needs
age
edit
i
have
never
had
a
barley
wine
but
i
imagine
this
taste
like
that
haha
but
i
know
its
an
american
strong
ale
d
cloudy
chestnut
brown
with
decent
foam
sweet
hop
and
malt
scent
with
neither
being
overpowering
and
in
that
i
dont
know
what
to
expect
with
so
many
superfluous
comments
about
in
regards
to
this
beer
a
bit
of
candi
sugar
in
the
front
of
taste
with
an
assertive
malt
bill
holding
up
the
rest
raisin
and
spice
in
the
end
with
a
little
alcohol
bite
which
is
not
kept
a
secret
that
will
creep
up
on
you
mf
is
creamy
and
quite
nice
d
very
drinkable
as
the
bottle
says
loved
by
few
hated
by
many
macrobeers
eat
your
hearts
out
i
might
call
it
a
big
brother
to
yakima
twilight
but
this
one
is
truly
unlike
any
other
beer
not
a
total
joy
but
definitely
an
experience
a
creamy
mouthfeel
with
small
soft
bubbles
dvery
much
a
sipping
beer
great
beer
for
grainiacs
would
recommend
taking
this
one
slow
enjoyed
a
bomber
22
oz
at
union
jack
pub
and
restaurant
in
historic
downtown
winchester
thank
goodness
our
founding
fathers
didnt
have
this
or
wed
never
have
chased
those
pesky
redcoats
away
back
to
the
matters
at
hand
though
i
did
however
opt
out
on
the
100
oz
bottle
that
our
waiter
offered
with
much
despair
and
settled
for
the
bomber
and
a
pint
glass
had
i
know
beforehand
my
brotherinlaw
was
buying
however
i
may
have
delved
into
that
2
foot
tall
bottle
anyway
the
beer
delivered
the
hoppiness
that
i
was
accustomed
to
from
a
stone
ale
and
had
some
faint
fruit
hints
with
little
attention
drawn
to
the
alcohol
poured
a
nice
brown
with
a
reasonable
finger
and
one
half
of
head
it
tasted
a
tad
heavy
but
not
so
much
as
to
make
it
akin
to
a
stout
a
very
drinkable
beer
but
had
i
ordered
one
more
bomber
i
would
have
surely
tripped
on
the
cobblestone
and
felt
drinkers
remorse
in
the
morn
i
would
have
to
say
it
was
much
lighter
than
the
shepherds
pie
that
accompanied
it
highly
sippable
for
thar
style
not
harsh
overall
mellow
and
delicious
mouthfeel
is
chewy
drinkable
for
the
gravity
though
pours
a
very
cloudy
dark
amber
with
a
light
head
seems
to
be
rather
carbonated
i
get
a
fruity
aroma
off
the
beer
maybe
cherries
cant
place
it
tastes
rather
hoppy
and
alcoholic
with
fruit
oozing
through
as
well
i
dont
want
to
hold
it
in
my
mouth
long
due
to
the
alcohol
getting
a
little
overpowering
because
of
that
aforementioned
alcohol
its
not
very
drinkable
one
bomber
of
this
should
be
all
for
the
night
its
a
nice
beer
but
i
only
think
ill
get
it
on
special
occasions
sweet
strong
smell
of
hops
not
for
the
fainthearted
malty
backbone
that
holds
its
way
through
to
the
bitter
end
booziness
ooozes
throughout
the
tasting
carmalized
sugar
some
faint
fruits
and
sweet
malt
presence
for
the
entire
22
bomber
try
it
just
dont
buy
a
case
and
expect
you
and
2
others
to
drink
it
all
in
one
week
i
respect
this
beer
appreciate
this
beer
and
love
everything
about
it
with
the
exception
of
its
drinkability
this
is
a
beer
that
i
would
want
a
small
serving
of
in
a
snifter
and
thats
it
too
overpowering
and
harsh
to
drink
alot
of
dont
get
me
wrong
the
flavors
are
amazing
and
it
is
very
wonderful
to
throw
back
but
in
very
small
doses
this
is
a
rare
breed
of
bare
that
i
love
to
enjoy
but
few
and
far
between
i
think
i
opened
this
bottle
at
the
wrong
time
still
a
solid
assertive
yet
drinkable
beverage
full
bodied
sweet
with
a
somewhat
bitter
aftertaste
as
the
hops
make
their
presence
known
decent
carbonation
and
it
finishes
dry
a
nice
drinkable
brew
split
two
22oz
bombers
with
a
buddy
using
a
duvel
glass
pours
a
very
dark
red
thats
slightly
clear
decent
amount
of
foam
forming
at
the
top
of
the
glass
and
lots
of
lacing
on
the
sides
the
very
first
sip
has
that
alc
grabbing
attention
but
then
it
switches
into
a
smooth
malty
dark
fruit
taste
very
subtle
and
mellow
flavour
so
i
think
these
two
bottles
have
matured
a
bit
since
bottling
last
year
very
decent
beer
overall
wouldnt
say
its
anything
special
though
very
easy
to
drink
considering
the
10
5
not
bad
this
beer
is
of
special
character
it
is
good
and
it
knows
it
a
bit
of
a
strong
smoked
fruity
bite
to
it
mellowing
into
a
nice
hearty
roll
down
your
throat
smile
pours
dark
brown
with
an
offwhite
head
it
feels
so
good
sliding
down
to
the
belly
wow
score
4
3453
this
bottle
will
definitely
go
in
my
collection
and
i
may
get
another
one
down
the
line
to
age
properly
in
a
cellar
d
fantastic
but
man
watch
out
for
the
abv
i
definitely
need
to
find
a
bottle
with
a
few
years
on
it
this
new
bottle
was
so
smooth
that
i
cant
imagine
how
sublime
a
sipper
an
aged
version
would
be
nobody
would
mistake
this
for
a
everyday
beer
but
its
an
excellent
occasional
sipper
dark
mahogany
pour
ruby
highlights
and
a
small
dense
tan
head
smells
of
dark
fruit
citrus
caramel
malt
a
hint
of
spice
and
a
little
alcohol
very
complex
flavor
with
lots
of
intermingling
of
figs
caramel
and
and
in
your
face
hop
bitterness
nice
full
body
but
slightly
sticky
notes
fairly
different
from
the
arrogant
bastard
in
particular
in
how
this
one
is
rather
smooth
subdued
and
almost
unassuming
for
such
a
boozy
brew
likable
but
it
did
not
do
much
for
me
at
least
not
on
this
tasting
not
worthy
again
at
first
i
really
thought
that
it
was
served
too
cold
but
letting
it
warm
up
left
it
under
the
same
impression
for
me
im
checking
other
peoples
notes
and
i
am
thinking
if
i
had
a
strange
mellowed
out
or
late
bottle
batch
is
from
09
it
was
not
skunked
and
came
from
a
typically
very
reliable
place
so
this
is
a
solid
brew
by
stone
but
not
the
best
it
is
however
more
enjoyable
than
the
regular
arrogant
bastard
offering
this
beer
never
fails
to
impress
the
hell
out
of
me
why
not
just
replace
ab
with
this
i
was
kind
of
in
a
bad
mood
til
i
cracked
this
one
open
tonight
now
all
my
annoyances
are
drifting
away
it
is
one
of
the
most
well
rounded
balanced
tastiest
and
easiest
drinking
beers
around
big
sticky
bitter
boozey
brew
not
for
wussies
drinks
pretty
well
for
10
o
this
deserves
all
the
accolades
it
gets
i
should
have
bought
two
so
i
could
age
one
for
later
if
you
see
it
grab
it
its
been
a
few
years
since
ive
had
the
regular
arrogant
bastard
those
words
dont
seem
to
mesh
all
that
well
together
do
they
but
this
sure
is
reminiscent
of
that
beer
as
a
beefed
up
but
consistent
and
challenging
older
brother
i
can
see
that
this
otherwise
bucolic
sunday
afternoon
is
going
to
get
a
bit
larry
as
i
eventually
try
to
suss
out
a
suitable
supa
bowl
viewing
spot
reviewed
from
my
notes
served
in
a
snifter
at
the
lions
pride
the
beer
is
a
dark
ruby
hue
with
a
thin
head
of
tan
bubbles
it
is
too
dark
for
me
to
see
inside
the
glass
but
i
can
see
carbonation
bubbles
sticking
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
it
has
a
robust
malt
aroma
with
hints
of
toffee
and
raisin
the
flavor
has
a
big
malty
punch
up
front
and
a
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
that
lingers
on
there
is
plenty
of
sweetness
and
some
alcohol
to
contend
with
i
think
i
can
detect
tastes
of
dark
fruits
like
plum
but
it
is
the
malts
and
alcohol
that
dominate
it
has
a
medium
body
that
feels
thicker
due
to
the
thick
mouth
coat
there
isnt
much
carbonation
as
far
as
i
can
tell
i
wouldnt
classify
this
beer
as
a
sipper
but
it
also
isnt
one
you
want
to
drink
fast
a
22
oz
bomber
would
do
any
ba
nicely
any
more
beyond
the
initial
bottle
may
be
too
much
for
a
sitting
this
beer
has
some
great
cellaring
potential
i
want
to
review
one
thats
been
aged
d
very
good
beer
but
it
may
make
you
sick
if
you
drink
too
much
of
it
or
drunk
too
quickly
it
packs
a
punch
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
samuel
smiths
glass
very
nice
dark
amber
color
nice
head
and
some
of
the
best
lacing
ive
ever
seen
the
smell
is
all
hops
taste
is
similar
mostly
hops
but
with
a
malt
appearance
decent
mouthfeel
couldnt
drink
10
of
these
in
one
night
but
with
10
5
i
wouldnt
need
to
anyway
good
beer
but
id
get
the
arrogant
bastard
over
this
d
the
alcohol
hides
well
but
the
bitterness
holds
back
drinakbility
d
very
reminiscent
of
an
old
ale
that
was
blended
with
an
ipa
perhaps
this
was
aged
too
long
whatever
the
case
may
be
i
still
enjoy
it
i
just
think
that
this
would
be
better
fresher
in
my
opinion
d
if
you
have
enough
money
to
drink
this
regularly
then
more
power
to
you
i
would
drink
it
more
often
but
it
is
very
pricey
you
can
barely
tell
that
it
is
10
5
abv
overall
a
beer
everyone
should
try
once
d
the
10
5
is
well
hidden
but
you
better
watch
out
too
many
of
these
and
youll
become
a
bastard
another
great
offering
from
stone
i
would
take
one
of
these
any
day
unless
i
was
offered
an
arrogant
bastard
d
hoppy
but
good
it
really
grows
on
you
as
it
warm
in
your
jar
thank
you
stone
overall
a
really
smooth
and
tasty
beer
the
flvoar
profile
is
not
that
drastically
different
from
the
regular
bastard
except
for
a
higher
malt
presence
the
smoothness
is
the
real
highlight
here
just
wish
there
was
more
dviation
from
the
regular
bastard
taste
is
definetly
superstrong
a
blend
of
an
initial
roast
malty
sweetness
very
strong
one
mixed
directly
with
tonnes
of
alcohol
not
bad
but
certainly
strong
is
topped
off
with
an
overtaking
of
the
hops
in
a
formidable
manner
practically
anesthetising
the
tongue
pungent
liquor
feel
at
the
nose
sort
of
like
a
very
sweet
rum
which
is
why
i
rate
this
one
low
on
drinkability
its
good
but
one
or
twos
enough
definetly
overall
its
just
one
more
year
that
makes
me
wish
this
was
a
yearround
release
for
stone
outstanding
damn
the
spiciness
of
the
chorizo
only
adds
to
the
experience
this
beer
really
held
its
own
im
glad
i
have
a
few
more
of
these
for
later
drinkability
the
higher
content
keeps
it
from
being
a
session
beer
but
the
wonderful
taste
makes
it
drinkable
anyway
d
i
love
drinking
this
beer
it
has
a
great
aftertaste
that
stays
with
you
while
still
enticing
your
for
more
d
as
drinkable
as
a
strong
ale
comes
10
5
and
nothing
to
let
you
know
its
coming
to
get
you
ill
buy
again
soon
one
amazingly
complex
well
balanced
brew
do
recommend
while
its
drinkable
in
the
sense
that
i
want
to
drink
lots
more
of
this
after
this
bomber
i
dont
know
if
that
will
be
completely
feasible
the
alcohol
and
big
flavors
make
it
a
big
task
but
man
this
thing
is
delicious
one
of
my
favorite
stone
beers
to
date
but
then
again
pretty
much
all
of
their
beers
have
been
exceptional
so
far
i
do
love
this
beer
though
and
i
think
i
can
safely
be
deemed
worthy
truly
a
great
beer
notes
this
bastard
demands
your
respect
and
the
respect
of
your
your
palate
stronger
and
more
complex
than
the
regular
bastard
this
ones
a
unique
experience
and
one
hell
of
a
beer
very
good
and
shockingly
drinkable
for
10
percent
alcohol
very
smooth
and
worth
having
not
for
sessioning
but
a
22oz
isnt
out
of
the
range
for
a
big
meal
it
went
well
with
lemon
peppered
chicken
green
beans
and
cauliflower
a
great
food
beer
but
works
on
its
own
d
this
will
warm
you
right
up
sipping
beer
but
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
this
will
be
a
regular
for
me
different
experience
out
of
the
bottle
more
concentrated
more
like
a
barleywine
than
a
hoppy
strong
ale
which
was
my
experience
ontap
toffee
raisins
and
caramel
notes
all
make
this
beer
sweet
and
complex
borderline
cloying
but
not
quite
taste
came
close
to
earning
a
higher
score
but
i
needed
more
hops
this
is
a
bastard
ale
right
hops
not
as
aggressive
as
they
could
be
well
balanced
if
thats
your
thing
with
sweet
caramel
malt
winning
over
the
bitter
hops
this
beer
lacked
bitterness
my
palate
was
brutally
abused
on
this
night
still
not
as
good
aged
as
fresh
d
as
i
mentioned
before
the
biggest
flaw
with
this
beer
is
the
alcohol
presence
and
as
the
glass
warms
up
it
comes
out
a
bit
more
this
is
a
big
big
beer
and
one
you
cant
drink
too
much
of
in
a
sitting
i
could
have
enjoyed
at
least
one
more
of
these
if
i
hadnt
been
driving
better
safe
than
sorry
pours
up
to
a
two
finger
head
of
frothy
deep
tan
microfoam
pools
of
larger
bubbles
here
and
there
dissipates
a
bit
quicker
than
expected
however
no
lack
of
broad
lacings
left
behind
fully
opaque
red
rust
to
amber
color
like
a
glass
of
metallic
mud
swirled
about
no
variance
throughout
boozy
nose
of
coconut
custard
caramelized
brown
sugar
molasses
ginger
snaps
raisin
bread
and
then
releases
the
pink
grapefruit
mandarin
orange
citrus
pine
sap
and
green
straw
unprocessed
grains
fullbodied
the
carbonation
like
a
jelly
roll
gets
everything
cascading
left
and
right
for
better
or
worse
it
is
certainly
active
in
the
mouth
sweet
and
alcoholic
as
if
barrel
aged
the
caramel
molasses
butterscotch
not
to
be
denied
coats
the
palate
like
a
blanket
were
it
not
for
the
carbonation
and
the
bitterness
of
the
hops
it
would
move
into
old
ale
or
barleywine
territory
even
the
grapefruit
orange
citrus
feels
reduced
pine
and
flowers
here
seem
more
obligatory
than
natural
steady
presentation
of
the
cherry
apricot
peach
fruit
lower
degree
of
dried
fruit
character
admirably
not
imbalanced
yet
its
not
a
beer
founded
in
clarity
of
parts
and
choral
harmony
drinkability
i
must
not
be
worthy
it
is
delicious
but
huge
in
flavor
and
alcohol
screw
brandy
saint
bernards
should
carry
casks
of
this
stuff
to
stranded
alpine
skiers
other
notes
overall
a
very
good
beer
one
that
im
going
to
seek
out
every
year
as
soon
as
its
released
poured
from
a
bomber
with
2009
release
date
on
the
bottle
poured
into
my
oversized
snifter
and
had
about
2
inches
of
tan
head
very
dark
non
translucent
amber
in
color
dark
malts
and
dark
fruit
plums
and
raisins
dominate
the
scent
this
brew
has
a
hugely
hoppy
taste
along
with
roasted
malts
dark
fruits
are
evident
in
the
flavor
the
alcohol
is
very
warming
paired
very
well
with
my
1
5
inch
20
ounce
ribeye
steak
nevertheless
its
a
very
satisfying
brew
young
a
good
beer
but
i
enjoy
the
regular
arrogant
bastard
and
the
oaked
version
over
the
double
its
a
well
balanced
big
and
a
distinctly
west
coast
beer
but
just
misses
the
mark
for
me
d
if
you
dont
know
it
yet
stone
is
my
favorite
brewery
and
this
may
be
their
best
output
yet
this
is
quite
the
beer
and
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
but
if
youre
looking
for
something
hoppy
and
intense
this
is
right
up
your
alley
has
a
medium
body
quite
smooth
and
a
mild
boose
warming
effect
drinkability
is
excellent
the
way
its
brewed
hides
the
abv
to
some
degree
is
very
flavorful
strong
potentially
would
get
better
with
age
first
notice
the
signature
hop
smells
not
unlike
the
better
apas
but
the
malts
rule
the
day
as
soon
as
you
take
a
sip
the
strong
malt
and
high
abv
makes
for
great
beer
to
nurse
and
savor
i
waver
between
pale
ales
and
imperial
stouts
and
for
some
reason
this
just
feels
like
it
captures
the
best
of
both
kick
me
out
for
saying
that
but
thats
the
best
description
i
can
offer
this
guy
poured
deep
brown
rose
a
2
finger
head
that
diminished
to
little
islands
in
my
sniffer
it
smelled
of
strong
of
hops
and
booze
i
could
not
get
anything
else
out
of
the
aroma
the
tastes
is
malt
as
it
enters
the
pallet
then
is
quickly
overpowered
as
the
booze
and
hops
take
over
but
it
is
a
good
thing
the
alcohol
and
hops
are
balanced
quite
well
which
makes
this
one
an
easy
drinker
but
a
sipper
none
the
less
this
is
a
powerful
beer
and
it
lets
you
know
it
it
doesnt
try
to
hide
anything
what
you
taste
is
what
you
get
this
one
is
very
unique
and
will
buy
it
again
d
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
but
def
a
sipper
the
10
5
is
hard
to
miss
in
this
one
for
sure
ddefinitely
a
sipper
with
its
heavy
body
and
high
abv
but
very
enjoyable
and
a
very
well
hidden
abv
and
if
heavy
body
does
not
deter
you
from
a
beer
this
is
very
recommened
d
whoa
this
one
is
hitting
me
hard
first
aged
db
ive
had
typically
drink
these
fresh
but
found
this
on
the
shelf
at
a
local
store
and
had
to
give
a
try
hops
are
there
but
definitely
faded
over
a
fresh
bottle
alcohol
is
noticeable
and
sweet
maltiness
is
a
bit
overpowering
this
is
a
serious
sipper
for
me
d
strong
flavor
but
also
boozy
it
is
tasty
so
i
want
another
but
strong
and
i
wouldnt
want
any
more
than
that
12
finger
white
head
quick
dissipation
and
minimal
lacing
copper
reddish
clear
amber
body
certainly
has
a
barleywine
type
nose
sweet
not
much
smoke
in
initial
whiff
nice
hop
presence
piney
and
citrus
as
it
warmed
up
the
smoke
became
more
pronounced
in
the
nose
the
taste
is
dominated
by
sweetish
caramel
malts
a
bit
of
fruit
rainier
cherries
and
pear
smoke
and
a
bit
of
leather
not
the
most
carbonated
of
beers
pretty
drinkable
for
this
high
abv
but
one
bomber
is
sufficient
i
thought
this
was
nicely
balanced
certainly
a
step
up
complexity
wise
from
regular
bastard
would
like
to
see
how
this
taste
after
a
bit
of
aging
i
knew
there
was
a
reason
id
stashed
that
2006
bottle
d
complex
enough
to
stay
interesting
but
watch
out
for
the
sneaky
abv
d
10
5
not
noticed
what
so
ever
a
very
well
rounded
and
a
drinkable
brew
1
bomber
is
not
enough
md
mouthfeel
is
mediumheavy
bodied
and
pretty
well
carbonated
good
but
nothing
extremely
special
pretty
drinkable
for
the
alcohol
although
a
bomber
is
enough
for
me
overall
prett
decent
its
like
an
ipa
on
steroids
not
totally
my
thing
but
i
see
its
mass
appeal
drinkability
excellent
i
loved
it
i
would
drink
it
again
3
5
d
really
tasty
brew
one
of
the
few
brews
that
manages
to
get
lots
of
malt
flavor
and
lots
of
hop
flavor
and
do
both
well
however
its
simply
too
boozy
especially
for
only
10
5
i
found
three
beers
at
a
store
that
were
12
years
old
and
this
was
the
best
of
the
bunch
bottled
over
two
years
ago
i
lost
my
notes
but
i
remember
that
i
liked
this
a
great
deal
it
had
latent
sour
beer
notes
almost
similar
to
consecration
by
russian
river
it
is
brown
with
a
tinge
of
orange
very
little
head
when
i
poured
it
into
a
glass
smelled
almost
better
then
it
tasted
fruity
maybe
plum
esters
on
the
noise
mouthfeel
is
not
thick
and
not
thin
a
little
resinous
but
still
well
balanced
putting
all
these
descriptions
together
this
ale
is
very
drinkable
well
balanced
very
alchoholic
at
10
5
but
outstanding
it
will
make
you
arrogant
after
drinking
one
theres
no
turning
back
d
strong
and
bitter
my
stomach
is
a
little
off
so
im
struggling
with
this
one
it
is
enjoyable
though
nice
sipper
but
too
heavy
and
sweet
for
me
on
a
regular
enjoyable
basis
d
very
strong
but
i
still
feel
like
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
beer
as
the
flavors
are
well
blended
and
nothing
dominates
the
flavor
too
much
darkish
coppermahogany
in
color
with
a
tightly
packed
short
tan
head
smell
is
phenomenal
pine
citrus
pepper
faint
banana
bready
malts
and
hints
of
alcohol
backed
sweetness
i
love
arrogant
bastard
and
thought
this
would
be
spectacular
after
smelling
it
but
that
wasnt
the
case
this
was
just
too
sweet
for
me
perhaps
im
not
worthy
but
im
going
to
have
to
stick
with
the
plain
jane
bastard
model
alcohol
was
pretty
well
hidden
i
just
found
the
sweetness
required
to
obtain
a
couple
extra
percentage
points
of
abv
a
bit
worthless
it
was
good
no
doubt
i
just
expected
better
future
outlook
good
stuff
ive
got
another
one
kicking
around
here
somewhere
so
im
set
for
now
this
is
definitely
an
after
dinner
sipper
that
goes
down
best
slowly
while
savoring
every
sip
glad
i
got
to
try
this
on
tap
because
its
very
different
that
what
i
remember
the
bottle
being
notes
i
definitely
want
to
try
this
one
again
while
it
was
very
good
im
not
sure
it
was
excellent
the
smell
didnt
quite
come
through
to
me
and
for
some
reason
i
was
expecting
more
from
the
taste
as
well
too
im
not
sure
if
it
was
overhyped
to
me
or
if
the
bottle
was
a
little
old
a
very
good
beer
and
one
that
i
will
try
and
also
rate
again
overall
this
one
is
a
big
letdown
i
thought
it
might
have
help
up
a
little
bit
but
it
is
drinking
terrible
i
doubt
i
will
even
bother
with
the
rest
of
my
glass
this
beer
will
probably
get
drainpoured
overall
this
is
excellent
but
what
else
would
you
expect
from
stone
got
to
drink
this
carefully
though
at
10
percent
alcohol
d
this
is
a
very
strong
brew
no
doubt
but
if
you
sip
it
its
actually
quite
tasteful
and
doesnt
sit
heavy
in
the
stomach
for
10
5
abv
the
alcohol
is
masked
pretty
nicely
and
it
makes
for
a
good
winter
warmer
hard
to
rate
this
highly
drinkable
at
such
a
high
abv
but
it
is
probably
more
drinkable
than
many
other
beers
with
this
much
alcohol
slightly
more
enjoyable
and
vastly
more
complex
than
arrogant
bastard
ale
this
is
definitely
an
american
strong
ale
that
excels
at
drinkability
very
well
balanced
between
all
aspect
that
comprise
a
beer
that
can
be
enjoyed
for
multiple
iterations
drinkability
im
not
crazy
like
everyone
else
is
about
this
beer
it
is
a
great
one
though
not
excessively
drinkable
more
of
a
special
occasion
beer
and
we
all
know
snow
is
a
special
occasion
what
a
great
beer
alcohol
is
frightening
at
first
but
you
quickly
get
adjusted
to
its
badassness
after
a
few
sips
it
reminds
me
slightly
of
a
nice
aged
barleywine
super
malty
but
hops
are
still
kickin
a
bomber
of
this
fresh
or
aged
will
always
please
me
pours
a
cloudy
dark
orange
color
without
much
of
a
head
on
it
looks
very
thick
out
of
the
bottle
tons
of
sediment
floating
around
in
the
beer
smell
is
awesome
has
a
distinct
hop
aroma
to
it
smell
reminds
me
of
of
a
dfh
90
min
for
some
reason
i
think
its
the
mixture
of
lots
of
hops
and
lots
more
malt
taste
is
great
like
all
of
stones
beer
a
nice
thick
syrupy
mouthfeel
compliments
the
great
taste
the
drinkability
is
lower
just
because
of
the
strength
of
the
beer
wish
i
could
get
stone
here
have
to
rely
on
gifts
from
friends
thick
and
chewy
mouthfeel
light
to
medium
carbonation
solid
all
around
and
probably
just
as
good
as
arrogant
bastard
but
im
not
sure
i
have
a
preference
among
the
two
obviously
this
one
is
a
little
more
powerful
so
i
wouldnt
typically
overindulge
on
it
but
its
hard
to
argue
with
db
otherwise
i
would
have
no
problem
pounding
down
3
of
these
the
only
problem
is
that
they
would
end
up
pounding
me
back
but
i
kinda
like
that
like
most
west
coast
beers
they
are
experts
at
hiding
the
alcohol
pick
up
a
few
of
these
if
you
can
find
them
it
seems
more
like
a
double
ipa
than
an
american
strong
ale
d
yes
someone
who
knows
me
please
buy
me
more
for
christmas
and
while
theyre
at
it
poured
from
22
oz
bomber
and
was
highly
anticipating
this
beer
great
smell
decent
apperance
blah
strong
overpowering
alcohol
bite
i
know
this
is
a
strong
ale
but
this
is
beyond
belief
blahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblah
not
for
me
im
done
with
these
arrogant
and
double
bastard
beers
ps
i
love
stones
ruination
this
beer
flies
close
to
the
sun
it
exemplifies
the
stone
ideal
of
extreme
idiosyncratic
perfection
its
arrogant
bastard
on
overdrive
with
every
aspect
dangerously
turned
up
yet
completely
balanced
some
beers
achieve
a
subtle
harmony
of
malt
hops
and
spice
this
one
matches
the
balance
of
such
beers
while
sloughing
off
any
semblance
of
restraint
it
may
not
be
for
everyone
but
if
you
like
these
flavors
and
this
style
double
bastard
is
a
perfect
beer
myself
i
could
drink
this
every
day
its
a
favorite
i
need
to
find
one
of
the
special
varieties
a
very
tasty
brew
that
goes
down
very
smooth
for
the
10
5
reminds
me
of
an
english
barleywine
without
the
almost
cloying
residual
sweetness
i
tend
to
get
from
them
poured
into
a
pint
glass
with
a
heavy
head
dark
caramel
nontransparent
coloring
smells
of
sweet
maybe
brown
sugar
and
just
a
little
hops
drinks
very
smooth
considering
the
abv
light
carbonation
helps
balance
out
the
thickness
the
finish
of
this
beer
has
just
the
right
amount
of
bitterness
to
balance
out
the
initial
sweetness
overall
i
was
very
impressed
and
would
be
willing
to
pay
the
higher
price
again
for
this
type
of
beer
creamy
and
it
will
pucker
you
up
a
bit
it
is
really
complex
brew
will
hit
this
up
again
and
find
more
and
more
about
it
double
bastard
ale
pours
a
brown
color
with
a
tan
head
from
a
brown
twenty
two
ounce
bottle
the
aroma
is
intensely
hoppy
pine
and
floral
notes
abound
the
flavor
is
intensely
hoppy
grapefruit
and
pine
especially
come
to
mind
the
malt
balances
this
a
bit
but
its
really
all
about
the
hops
this
beer
is
dangerous
there
is
no
hint
of
the
10
alcohol
i
could
drink
several
bottles
easily
in
a
session
d
regardless
of
the
ten
and
a
half
abv
this
stuff
is
easy
to
drink
goes
down
easy
and
although
it
has
a
complex
taste
the
high
abv
is
hidden
very
well
one
can
forget
how
strong
this
is
so
as
deceivingly
easy
this
is
to
drink
folks
gotta
be
careful
meanwhile
i
think
ill
have
another
sip
ahh
youre
not
worthy
as
it
warms
it
only
intensifies
and
improves
this
is
a
beer
for
which
angels
weep
it
will
put
you
on
your
ass
if
you
arent
careful
very
drinkable
for
all
its
high
abv
but
if
you
decide
to
session
it
you
may
well
wind
up
on
youtube
under
the
heading
drunkest
guy
ever
youve
been
warned
stone
has
truly
outdone
themselves
with
this
beer
this
is
an
exception
to
the
rule
but
it
ought
to
be
the
rule
on
tap
at
the
sierra
grill
in
northampton
zapps
and
mikey
larse
couldnt
handle
this
one
so
i
took
it
on
offered
in
a
full
pint
size
or
half
i
didnt
want
this
to
be
the
only
beer
i
could
have
so
i
opted
for
the
half
got
some
nice
flavor
out
of
this
one
hops
cherry
and
only
a
slight
warming
from
the
alcohol
a
very
well
balanced
big
beer
my
urge
to
consume
hop
heavy
bitterness
cured
dholy
mother
this
thing
is
so
smooth
and
complex
already
i
cant
imagine
what
cellaring
this
for
a
few
years
would
do
research
in
progress
d
well
its
not
what
i
thought
it
would
be
but
like
the
single
bastard
its
not
lacking
in
drinkability
treat
it
like
a
barleywine
and
youll
be
fine
serving
type
bottle
pours
a
semi
murky
red
with
half
finger
head
that
doesnt
retain
too
well
and
leaves
no
lacing
could
be
the
bar
glasses
smell
is
surprisingly
weak
in
strength
just
some
hops
and
malts
taste
makes
me
remeber
the
last
time
i
had
this
fresh
the
best
possible
balance
of
piney
hops
malts
sweets
and
alcohol
bite
mouthfeel
is
also
nice
mediumheavy
with
creaminess
and
good
appropriate
carbonation
nice
amount
of
alcohol
warming
drinkability
is
good
the
hop
and
alcohol
will
kill
this
one
after
a
while
double
bastard
is
great
d
this
is
pretty
drinkable
and
the
fact
that
it
is
over
10
and
so
drinkable
is
what
bumps
it
up
to
a
4
5
for
me
very
impressive
masking
of
the
booziness
with
nicely
rounded
flavors
not
too
much
of
any
one
thing
overall
its
about
what
i
expected
a
much
stouter
version
of
arrogant
bastard
ale
a
must
try
for
all
fans
of
stone
d
this
is
a
big
one
at
first
i
was
a
little
underwhelmed
but
a
few
sips
in
it
started
to
open
up
the
is
that
of
a
classic
mustardy
american
barleywine
and
the
flavor
is
a
complex
interaction
of
caramel
malts
and
dark
bitter
hops
it
reminds
me
in
many
ways
of
brooklyn
monster
except
this
tasting
requires
me
to
take
down
a
whole
bomber
of
this
big
intense
beer
seems
like
this
would
be
well
worth
laying
down
for
a
couple
of
years
to
mature
great
beer
although
the
oaked
ab
edges
it
out
only
thing
is
id
say
the
fruitiness
is
a
tad
too
overpowering
which
affects
the
drinkability
to
some
degree
i
never
thought
id
say
a
beer
could
be
bolder
than
the
regular
ab
but
wow
never
mind
this
beer
definitely
lives
up
to
the
ridiculous
hype
the
label
suggests
i
appreciate
stones
attitude
but
their
beers
are
pretty
good
too
d
cant
do
much
with
this
one
with
the
high
abv
this
has
the
potential
to
go
down
or
uphill
depending
on
what
a
few
years
will
do
to
it
right
now
this
is
good
beer
but
my
score
will
be
revised
when
i
revisit
a
cellared
bottle
or
tap
offering
im
hoping
it
goes
up
overall
not
as
intense
as
regular
arrogant
bastard
for
some
reason
not
bad
except
for
the
potent
ammonia
scent
ill
give
this
one
another
chance
in
the
future
but
i
really
dont
think
this
is
a
bad
keg
this
is
a
big
ale
and
a
worthy
heir
to
the
arrogant
bastard
name
d
still
tastes
strong
as
hell
after
5
years
one
of
these
is
good
for
a
sharing
and
caring
notes
pale
ale
times
10
very
strong
very
hoppy
and
bitter
yet
enough
malt
to
provide
some
balance
22
oz
bottle
pours
a
deep
amber
color
with
a
rich
cream
colored
head
aroma
is
of
banannas
caramel
floral
and
citrus
taste
is
strong
with
the
hops
throughout
but
carrying
a
sugary
undertone
throughout
with
a
hint
of
roasted
malt
in
the
long
finish
full
bodied
with
a
thick
texture
overall
gets
better
as
it
warms
good
job
from
stone
but
not
any
better
than
expected
where
is
the
ab
character
i
had
never
had
this
on
tap
and
thoroughly
enjoyed
it
it
was
the
perfect
cold
weather
beer
well
worth
seeking
it
out
d
this
is
a
pretty
unique
brew
in
my
opinion
lots
of
interesting
flavors
that
balance
out
pretty
well
with
each
other
even
though
i
feel
this
is
more
of
a
sipper
drinkability
is
pretty
good
for
the
style
and
amount
of
alcohol
that
is
readily
apparent
i
think
with
a
year
or
two
of
age
this
one
will
be
even
better
than
it
already
is
overall
this
is
a
big
beer
that
is
worth
challenging
because
it
is
highly
drinkable
and
smooth
not
an
alcohol
bomb
like
it
could
have
been
o
better
than
old
guardian
but
i
was
expecting
more
hop
character
arrogant
bastard
tastes
hoppier
better
as
warms
very
barleywinelike
overall
i
do
love
this
beer
and
highly
recommend
it
to
everyone
an
absolute
must
try
for
everyone
drinkability
i
love
stone
beers
and
this
one
is
generally
well
brewed
but
i
think
they
could
do
better
the
hops
arent
as
aggresive
as
expected
for
a
beer
of
this
caliber
and
the
sweetness
is
overwhelming
tastes
similar
to
lagunitas
brews
which
i
love
in
my
opinion
essentially
a
great
beer
that
could
be
improved
taste
is
hot
and
malty
slight
burnt
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
way
too
much
heat
from
this
needs
a
bit
of
age
on
it
nice
beer
but
not
too
many
d
very
whats
not
to
love
its
got
a
lot
of
hops
and
a
lot
of
malt
both
balanced
together
its
luxury
for
the
palate
theres
no
going
back
but
there
is
going
forward
i
think
i
will
go
out
to
the
stone
brewery
this
weekend
and
try
this
on
tap
an
interesting
brew
richer
and
more
robust
than
regular
ab
and
without
the
occasional
dead
spot
yet
in
exchange
the
hop
notes
can
be
scuttled
beneath
the
malts
at
times
still
robustly
hoppy
through
the
foam
of
a
fresh
pour
nonetheless
a
fair
and
equitable
exchange
per
se
equally
enjoyable
given
the
mood
though
likely
better
served
in
12
oz
bottles
given
the
potent
a
style
bender
for
sure
mouthfeel
is
pretty
full
chewy
wellcarbonated
drinkable
well
kinda
the
heat
while
mild
reminds
of
the
10
5
abv
that
said
22oz
goes
down
pretty
easy
this
is
the
stone
beer
that
just
gets
me
going
im
not
the
biggest
fan
of
ab
unless
its
on
tap
this
one
however
is
one
bad
mofo
d
really
nice
i
feel
like
sipping
this
all
night
notesput
it
up
next
to
an
09
and
there
is
virtually
no
difference
i
think
the
malt
may
have
added
some
very
faint
notes
of
chocolate
but
honestly
i
dont
think
i
could
pick
out
which
was
which
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
but
perhaps
overcarbonated
in
its
youth
this
progresses
favorably
as
time
goes
on
drinkability
is
nothing
other
than
constantly
reaching
for
more
drinkability
a
great
beer
if
you
havent
tried
this
do
whatever
you
can
to
find
it
arrogant
bastard
is
great
but
double
bastard
is
awesome
hoppy
enough
for
hopheads
but
surprisingly
drinkable
enough
for
the
rest
of
us
get
it
at
whatever
cost
wow
overall
this
is
such
an
extreme
beer
that
it
needs
to
be
tried
by
any
fan
of
beer
with
intense
and
rich
flavor
lets
see
what
some
age
does
to
it
recommended
d
a
hopheads
dream
bitter
and
floral
and
layers
of
sweetness
in
between
sips
a
well
made
beer
that
i
would
have
again
when
the
hop
bug
bites
recommend
d
only
knock
on
this
beer
would
be
the
slight
alcohol
taste
at
10
it
is
however
hidden
very
well
whenever
i
drink
a
beer
like
this
i
wonder
how
it
will
age
this
is
one
of
those
strong
ales
that
i
bet
would
get
sweeter
with
time
as
the
hops
fell
back
and
the
alcohol
warmness
mellowed
drinkability
true
to
its
name
this
beer
is
extremely
arrogant
the
bitterness
and
alcohol
are
upfront
and
unapologetic
to
quote
terrell
owens
dont
hate
me
cause
you
love
me
beer
pours
a
clear
amber
colour
with
very
little
head
smells
somewhat
sweet
with
fruity
undertones
and
alcohol
lurking
just
below
tastes
like
hops
that
were
soaked
in
alcohol
and
bottled
and
i
love
it
the
hoppy
taste
comes
right
up
and
punches
you
in
the
mouth
then
the
alcohol
makes
you
do
a
double
take
if
i
were
this
good
id
be
arrogant
as
well
as
i
drink
more
i
want
to
drink
more
and
while
i
know
that
spending
my
life
savings
buying
as
many
of
these
as
possible
is
a
bad
idea
im
afraid
that
if
i
dont
the
scary
man
on
the
bottle
will
come
to
my
house
and
make
me
pay
dearly
for
not
embracing
him
and
his
evil
ways
truly
this
is
an
arrogant
bastard
in
all
its
glory
and
i
am
its
humble
servant

a
medium
mahogany

a
creamy

all
the
characteristics
from

with
a
definite
but
smooth

sweet
red

and
great
carbonationmouthfeel
overall
an
awesome
beer
that
is
sweet
and
smooth
aged
to
perfection
mouthfeel
is
a
good
medium
with
plenty
of
carbonation
so
glad
to
finally
get
a
hold
of
this
in
ct
drinkability
a
wonderfully
well
rounded
beer
with
a
worryingly
drinkable
character
not
a
trace
of
the
potent
alcohol
in
the
taste
beautifully
crafted
brickskeller7pint
absolutely
among
the
more
drinkable
strong
ales
the
double
bastard
offers
a
great
example
of
what
simple
brewmaking
can
do
its
a
storybook
beer
from
a
flagship
westcoast
brewery
its
remarkable
how
easy
i
can
sip
and
analyze
this
one
at
10
its
easy
how
i
can
carry
on
endlessly
about
its
qualities
appropriate
among
any
offerings
the
beer
in
sum
is
an
exemplary
strong
ale
drinkability
this
is
the
reason
i
am
so
happy
stone
has
landed
in
connecticut
i
cant
beleive
i
was
missing
out
on
beers
like
this
out
of
all
the
stone
beers
ive
had
this
one
takes
the
cake
as
my
favorite
lots
of
huge
flavor
profiles
here
from
the
bitter
yet
full
fledged
hoppiness
to
the
sweet
yet
smooth
and
robust
malt
backbone
an
excellent
beer
to
start
your
night
with
or
even
end
it
this
beer
is
dangerously
drinkable
so
make
sure
you
heed
the
warning
on
the
label
the
alcohol
will
really
creep
up
on

there

going

hit
with
sweet

smell
with
hints
of
earthy

the
taste
follows
right
in
stride
with
the
aroma
it
is
so
complex
i
havent
had
anything
quite
like
it
before
so
it
is
hard
to
describe
it
has
a
strong
malt
presence
but
it
isnt
quite
as
sweet
as
the
smell
let
on
it
has
a
roastedsmokey
type
taste
that
is
balanced
so
nicely
with
the
hops
overall
a
very
interesting
beer
that
leaves
me
wanting
more
some
similarities
to
the
arrogant
bastard
ale
but
definitely
a
monster
by
itself
get
this
if
you
have
never
tried
it
it
is
an
experience
md
smooth
and
appropriately
carbonated
the
alcohol
hits
hard
but
is
appropriate
for
the
style
drinkability
is
also
excellent
i
can
put
down
a
lot
of
this
stuff
in
short
order
until
the
alcohol
punches
me
in
the
face
cheers
d
at
10
5
abv
this
is
a
sipper
as
a
preorpost
meal
drink
im
sure
it
would
pair
well
with
bbq
or
some
non
cream
based
sauces
and
marinades
but
its
so
rich
and
complex
id
almost
always
rather
have
it
on
its
own
a
must
try
for
a
fan
of
the
arrogant
bastard
arrogant
bastard
is
already
one
of
my
ultimates
this
is
probably
my
favorite
american
strong
ale
that
ive
ever
tried
d
well
this
most
definitely
is
not
a
beer
most
people
could
have
more
then
one
of
due
to
the
10
5
abv
but
if
you
consider
one
bottle
i
have
no
issues
finishing
this
bottle
and
going
sip
to
sip
overall
this
was
a
pretty
awesome
beer
that
got
much
much
better
as
it
warmed
up
definitely
pick
up
a
bottle
of
this
for
a
good
beer
to
sip
on
throughout
the
night
drinkability
incredibly
quaffable
for
a
big
brew
this
past
week
stone
brewery
released
their
tenth
edition
of
the
double
bastard
ale
a
doubled
up
version
of
their
popular
arrogant
bastard
ale
i
have
loved
the
arrogant
bastard
for
many
years
now
and
the
double
bastard
is
just
that
much
better
it
pours
are
golden
copper
color
with
a
thin
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
the
nose
is
kind
of
sweet
with
notes
of
caramael
and
cane
sugar
with
a
slight
bit
of
citrus
from
the
hops
at
first
taste
the
double
bastard
comes
across
well
balanced
between
the
sweetness
of
the
malts
and
the
bitterness
of
the
hops
but
as
the
beer
lingers
the
hops
really
start
to
show
through
i
get
flavors
of
caramel
dark
chocolate
anise
and
citrus
and
since
this
beer
is
10
5
abv
the
flavors
are
intense
and
dominating
about
as
little
carbonation
as
you
can
get
nice
complement
to
the
heavy
mouthfeel
at
10
5
you
have
to
expect
a
great
mouthfeel
this
one
is
an
absolute
wrecking
ball
on
the
palate
even
after
the
first
few
ounces
its
great
but
at
10
5
and
hoppy
dont
expect
to
have
more
than
a
glass
or
two
this
is
without
a
doubt
one
of
the
best
batches
of
double
bastard
ever
2009
sets
a
new
standard
for
this
and
all
beers
m
medium
body
but
smooth
smooth
the
carbonation
isnt
over
powering
tingles
a
bit
you
can
definately
feel
the
alcohol
and
it
leaves
a
slight
bitter
coffee
taste
in
the
mouth
with
a
lingering
alcohol
slow
burn
i
like
it
alot
i
definately
could
drink
a
few
of
these
d
a
tasty
sipper
with
interesting
mouthfeel
aroma
and
taste
not
as
complex
as
id
hoped
no
sign
of
the
10
abv
makes
it
a
dangerous
one
d
while
individually
the
malt
and
hop
profile
are
above
average
together
the
difference
is
too
stark
for
my
liking
a
bit
of
a
failed
effort
at
our
amazingly
balanced
east
coast
ipas
d
quite
drinkable
for
a
10
5
strong
ale
went
down
a
little
too
quick
actually
and
hits
pretty
hard
but
very
drinkable
and
smooth
for
being
such
a
high
abv
ale
overall
this
is
quite
a
delicious
beer
that
i
will
be
sure
to
revisit
and
lay
down
for
future
tastings
d
very
drinkable
10
5
dangerously
so
where
do
i
start
db
pours
a
dark
brownish
reddish
color
with
an
amazing
head
amazing
from
the
get
go
smells
of
piney
citrusy
hops
smack
you
in
the
face
and
make
your
mouth
water
believe
it
or
not
stone
figured
out
a
way
to
make
aba
better
a
strong
taste
of
hops
and
citrus
greet
every
tastebud
in
you
mouth
you
cant
get
enough
a
great
stinging
mouthfeel
comes
with
db
it
hangs
with
you
for
a
while
for
a
strong
ale
this
one
goes
down
beautifully
only
problem
is
i
havent
found
the
right
amount
i
always
wind
up
drinking
too
much
excellent
beer
couldnt
please
me
any
better
must
try
tom
and
analise
d
really
an
amazing
beer
its
definitely
a
sipper
due
to
the
abv
but
its
soo
damn
good
you
just
wanna
drink
more
cheers
d
i
fail
to
see
why
the
double
version
of
this
beer
is
smoother
more
palatable
and
less
bitter
tasting
then
the
regular
version
seems
a
little
counterintuitive
to
me
perhaps
it
is
just
the
refinement
of
my
taste
buds
i
dont
get
it
but
i
like
this
beer
it
makes
me
want
to
revisit
arrogant
bastard
of
which
i
was
not
the
biggest
fan
drinkability
i
drank
22oz
in
like
10
minutes
and
i
only
wish
i
had
more
time
i
would
glady
drink
this
all
day
on
a
lazy
summer
weekend
this
beer
is
great
but
be
warned
a
bomber
of
this
will
smack
you
around
call
you
a
bitch
and
expect
you
to
like
it
d
i
couldnt
finish
the
whole
bomber
very
thick
becomes
hard
to
drink
about
34
of
the
way
through
solid
but
theres
a
limit
to
how
much
of
this
i
can
get
down
d
this
becomes
a
little
much
and
its
difficult
to
finish
the
entire
bomber
dont
think
its
really
meant
to
be
more
than
a
sipper
though
at
10
5
abv
and
a
metric
shitload
of
ibus
there
is
a
small
amount
of
bitterness
but
this
beer
is
really
malty
and
sweet
so
it
is
dangerously
drinkable
i
mention
danger
only
because
of
the
high
abv
which
is
already
starting
to
have
some
effect
thank
you
stone
you
never
disappoint
hey
enough
of
my
gushing
go
out
and
get
some
for
yourself
taste
and
believe
i
like
this
much
more
than
the
regular
arrogant
bastard
the
smell
is
similar
to
bigfoot
but
the
drinkability
is
much
better
overall
okay
drinkability
the
sweet
malt
flavor
is
not
as
strong
as
i
would
like
the
strong
bitterness
is
not
balanced
out
with
any
other
flavors
in
the
smell
the
malt
character
is
really
good
nice
sweet
roasted
nut
aroma
but
in
the
flavor
that
malt
character
takes
a
back
seat
to
the
strong
hop
bitterness
i
hoped
that
waiting
a
bit
to
drink
this
would
help
the
malt
come
through
with
the
hops
muted
a
little
but
i
either
didnt
wait
long
enough
or
that
doesnt
happen
with
this
beer
2008
release
1
finger

to
light

throughout
dark
murky
red
with
a
light
frothy
cap
smell
is
boozey
malts
slight
hops
baked

and
caramel
taste
is
less
boozey
bit
more
hoppy
and
huge

mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
full
with
mild

ive
had
the
2008
release
4
times
since
it
came
out
and
its
worth
cellaring
drinkability
for
this
abv
is
out
of
this
world
cheers
mouthfeeldrinkability
the
viscous
texture
lays
across
the
tongue
and
disperses
nicely
down
the
throat
i
would
suggest
a
hearty
beef
or
game
dish
with
this
one
as
the
gigantic
overall
character
calls
for
something
big
to
complement
it
ive
survived
the
bottle
but
havent
stood
up
yet
maybe
ill
just
sleep
in
this
chair
tonight
cheers
the
double
magnum
needs
to
be
enjoyed
at
a
party
or
at
least
with
a
whole
lot
of
friends
who
respect
strong
beer
another
one
of
my
local
favorites
picked
up
a
22
oz
from
the
liquor
store
in
my
neighborhood
it
poured
a
deep
copper
red
with
a
nice
foamy
head
it
smelled
of
citrusy
hops
with
underlying
sweet
toasty
malt
aroma
it
tasted
of
sweet
burnt
malt
with
a
nice
hop
bite
though
the
alcohol
is
quite
high
i
do
enjoy
drinking
one
of
these
after
dinner
i
didnt
have
a
lot
of
trouble
finishing
the
bottle
but
i
couldnt
have
had
two
a
good
beer
with
an
aggressive
alcohol
bite
aged
this
beer
is
great
but
fresh
its
to
much
d
the
alcohol
is
hidden
nicely
i
didnt
have
any
problem
taking
down
my
bomber
i
will
be
looking
to
pick
this
up
again
had
this
one
the
other
day
after
work
poured
an
opaque
rust
color
with
caramel
head
that
faded
slow
and
left
decent
lacing
smelled
of
alcohol
up
front
yeast
earthy
hops
and
fruit
tasted
of
hops
big
malt
and
sweetness
smooth
though
a
bit
dry
and
nice
warmth
from
alcohol
for
me
this
just
did
not
meet
the
standards
that
arrogant
bastard
sets
for
itself
sorry
dark
amber
with
a
generous
beige
head
as
it
poured
the
aroma
is
citrusy
and
sweet
the
taste
started
out
bitter
fortunately
i
had
a
bomber
to
myself
so
i
experimented
a
little
cold
it
tasted
better
from
the
bottle
than
from
a
glass
however
once
warmed
the
bitterness
went
away
sweet
and
citrus
came
through
very
well
i
am
now
convinced
that
this
beer
should
only
be
served
at
cellar
temperatures
5558
degree
at
the
very
end
of
the
bottle
i
am
getting
a
pleasant
little
tartbitter
bite
at
the
back
of
the
throat
and
i
like
it
feel
was
good
nothing
remarkable
pretty
good
drinkability
considering
the
abv
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
and
a
great
one
if
you
remember
to
respect
the
strength
of
this
beer
its
as
hot
and
strong
tasting
as
any
stone
selection
still
for
some
reason
its
very
easy
to
drink
too
much
at
once
use
a
very
small
glass
and
make
a
point
of
sipping
this
treat
drinkable
but
not
smooth
for
me
this
beer
packs
a
double
punch
with
all
the
flavors
and
with
the
alcohol
too
much
conflict
between
all
the
flavors
good
but
based
on
expectations
just
didnt
do
it
for
me
ill
have
to
try
it
again
o
this
is
an
awesome
beer
the
name
ways
it
all
its
a
arrogant
arrogant
bastard
of
a
beer
i
am
humbled
served
trappist
glass
a
classic
american
craft
brew
peppered
with
the
wonderful
american
hops
lusciousness
but
with
a
deep
complexity
underlying
this
this
is
not
simply
a
beer
brewed
to
the
extreme
for
the
sake
of
it
there
is
a
clarity
of
purpose
and
a
wonderful
structure
to
all
of
the
big
flavours
once
again
stone
has
given
me
an
extreme
but
philosophical
american
beer
experience
mouthfeel
is
deliciously
velvety
with
an
amazing
creaminess
that
somehow
overrides
the
prominent
alcohol
there
is
a
lot
to
like
in
this
sourness
makes
me
a
bit
meh
but
it
is
very
well
constructed
with
pleasant
flavours
and
an
amazing
mouthfeel
almost
cant
detect
alcohol
but
it
certainly
isnt
harsh
maybe
just
lowers
drinkability
but
id
definitely
want
another
one
of
these
taste
wow
pine
and
cherry
really
is
a
much
more
complex
beer
than
i
was
anticipating
id
love
to
have
a
few
more
bottles
of
this
beer
to
horde
away
for
a
few
years
a
very
nice
dipaor
strong
ale
but
i
still
prefer
dreadnaught
and
hosplam
in
a
similar
taste
profile
pours
heavy
into
a
very
cloudy
brownish
amber
with
an
offwhite
ivory
colored
foam
i
can
barely
see
light
through
the
glass
as
i
raise
the
glass
to
examine
the
colors
i
can
already
smell
the
wonderful
fragrance
nose
is
strong
of
very
chewy
caramel
malts
and
a
bit
of
alcohol
some
vanilla
and
a
bit
of
spice
is
somewhere
in
there
very
big
bodied
on
the
way
in
it
hits
you
first
with
that
wonderful
chewy
roasted
vanilla
caramel
flavor
and
the
malts
rush
throughout
your
palate
on
the
way
down
finishes
arrogantly
bitter
with
that
roasted
oak
lingering
in
the
distance
what
a
strong
ale
what
a
combination
holy
stone
these
bastards
are
good
pours
with
a
big
tan
head
the
beer
is
ruby
brown
in
color
smells
sweet
citric
alcoholy
almost
no
carbonation
from
the
first
sip
the
alcohol
makes
its
presence
known
bitter
throughout
with
a
nuttybitter
slightly
astringent
aftertaste
which
really
lingers
a
faint
mustiness
can
be
tasted
which
seems
odd
and
out
of
place
a
real
hoppy
kick
in
the
crotch
i
wanted
to
like
this
beer
more
but
it
was
a
little
too
bitterastringent
without
enough
balancing
maltiness
for
me
another
beer
from
stone
and
as
with
its
sibblings
it
didnt
disappoint
a
dark
brown
ale
with
a
not
quite
white
head
the
beer
tasted
bitter
but
not
quite
as
bitter
as
ruination
there
was
also
a
sort
of
sweet
finish
after
all
the
the
hopps
cleared
off
the
tongue
the
beer
smelled
sweet
but
with
the
hop
also
quite
noticeable
this
was
quite
a
big
beer
at
21
proof
so
i
split
the
bottle
with
a
friend
i
dont
know
that
id
want
to
try
a
bottle
alone
the
beer
was
pretty
smooth
though
its
not
exactly
easy
to
finish
the
bomber
by
yourself
but
it
sure
is
fun
this
is
an
amazing
brew
big
bold
and
just
the
right
amount
of
bitter
drinkability
very
drinkable
for
the
alcohol
content
excellent
sipping
beer
fairly
balanced
actually
in
an
over
the
top
way
the
sweet
malts
fruits
hops
and
booze
all
have
their
say
in
ample
parts
good
stuff
drinkability
no
easy
answer
here
but
the
drinkability
is
not
bad
and
is
rather
quite
pleasing
i
dont
think
know
if
i
would
want
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
single
sitting
but
its
absolutely
something
to
revisit
on
occasion
if
the
opportunity
arises
a
stellar
offering
overall
for
what
it
is
its
fairly
drinkable
though
it
seems
to
have
precipitated
a
bout
of
hiccups
i
suspect
this
bomber
will
take
me
a
couple
hours
to
polish
off
good
thing
this
is
my
friday
great
beer
dark
and
deep
better
served
cool
but
not
warm
and
not
cold
seems
to
have
that
perfect
taste
12
way
through
in
conclusion
being
a
home
brewer
i
will
use
this
beer
as
a
model
and
work
towards
it
if
i
ever
achieve
this
level
of
quality
i
will
consider
myself
an
accomplished
brewer
of
course
then
i
will
try
to
beat
them
out
d
one
was
enough
i
think
this
is
a
flagship
beer
for
its
style
its
relatively
easy
to
get
fairly
priced
and
has
alot
going
on
with
it
consistently
highly
recommended
if
you
want
a
solid
big
beer
d
this
brew
is
huge
with
an
explosive
taste
not
necessarily
a
sipper
but
it
would
be
difficult
to
get
down
more
than
one
of
these
considering
how
unmasked
and
untamed
the
alcohol
is
the
only
detraction
i
can
think
of
is
that
after
some
warming
up
the
beer
becomes
a
tad
unbalanced
favoring
the
hops
over
all
the
other
elements
i
realize
this
is
a
soughtafter
affect
these
days
but
a
very
slight
diminishing
of
the
hops
and
a
slight
favoring
of
the
sweet
and
fruity
elements
might
actually
lead
to
a
better
experience
without
taking
away
from
the
overall
boldness
of
the
brew
double
bastard
is
in
a
class
all
its
own
as
far
as
im
concerned
popped
open
a
22
oz
bottle
of
this
the
other
day
did
not
see
a
best
by
date
pours
a
copperamber
color
with
a
small
head
roasted
malts
and
caramel
come
out
of
the
nose
taste
is
all
over
the
place
starts
of
sticky
and
malty
and
finished
with
a
hop
sucker
punch
full
bodied
and
wellcarbonated
overall
a
great
beer
d
hop
explosion
and
high
alcohol
makes
this
one
to
be
enjoyed
slowly
but
it
certainly
is
good
notes
a
beer
with
an
attitude
read
the
label
that
delivers
completely
bravo
d
very
drinkable
but
certainly
not
a
refreshing
beer
tasty
throughout
and
leaves
you
wanting
more
d
this
is
a
big
beer
definitely
a
tough
one
to
move
through
quick
i
would
only
have
one
of
these
at
a
sitting
and
then
reach
for
something
else
definitely
like
a
rich
barleywine
imo
i
like
it
a
lot
i
would
compare
it
to
a
harsh
old
guardian
honestly
d
the
10
5
creeps
in
by
the
end
and
starts
to
dampen
the
drinkability
of
an
otherwise
good
beer
will
have
from
time
to
time
when
i
see
it
nice
sipper
that
will
age
well
i
am
going
to
celler
a
few
of
these
i
cant
wait
to
tatse
this
in
a
few
years
22oz
bottle
i
had
the
pleasure
of
trying
this
during
the
same
session
as
arrogant
bastard
and
i
think
the
comparison
helped
me
understand
there
beers
much
more
db
has
a
very
similar
appearance
with
maybe
a
little
more
honey
in
the
body
and
a
slightly
darker
and
fluffier
head
the
aroma
is
malty
and
pretty
hoppy
with
lots
of
candied
citrus
richer
and
more
balanced
than
ab
the
flavor
is
similarly
balanced
with
massive
malts
citrus
hopps
and
a
little
alcohol
the
way
it
all
blends
into
one
smooth
experience
really
sets
it
above
all
the
flavors
work
well
together
over
a
thick
and
slightly
syrupy
body
lots
of
intense
flavors
and
you
definitely
cant
drink
a
lot
of
it
but
the
balance
and
smoothness
hold
it
all
together
beautifully
t
very
refreshing
and
drinkable
considering
the
high
alcohol
content
nice
thick
almost
syrupy
but
somehow
very
smooth
mouthfeel
very
very
good
beer
and
surprisingly
drinkable
at
10
d
pretty
drinkable
this
is
definitely
a
bastard
of
a
beer
i
had
this
pretty
fresh
and
id
like
to
try
aging
a
bottle
of
this
to
see
what
sort
of
complexities
comeout
poured
a
beautiful
deep
mahoganyred
color
with
a
big
head
and
good
lacing
smell
was
mostly
lemon
peel
and
citrus
hops
taste
was
floralcitrus
hops
and
a
strong
bitterness
that
was
not
overwhelming
medium
bodied
oily
good
carbonation
levels
it
was
a
little
rough
on
the
palette
and
a
bomber
is
way
too
much
to
have
at
once
but
i
enjoyed
this
thoroughly
easy
enough
to
drink
especially
for
the
abv
this
beer
poured
translucent
reddish
copper
with
a
twofinger
tan
head
the
smell
has
a
fruity
pineapple
character
along
with
some
piney
and
herbal
hops
and
alcohol
the
taste
is
all
about
extremes
it
starts
off
with
some
very
sweet
malt
thats
cut
by
some
very
aggressive
piney
hops
that
give
way
to
a
substantial
alcohol
presence
somehow
all
of
these
seem
to
balance
out
to
a
surprisingly
taste
and
drinkable
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
almost
syrupy
with
some
very
fine
carbonation
and
warming
from
the
alcohol
this
beer
is
surprisingly
drinkable
for
something
thats
10
5
and
is
definitely
something
worth
experiencing
if
you
have
a
chance
drinkability
i
am
sharing
this
one
as
i
rate
and
im
glad
im
doing
so
if
i
didnt
this
would
be
an
all
night
affair
drank
this
a
little
too
young
i
believe
with
a
bit
more
age
an
elite
beer
would
unfold
will
by
a
bunch
more
to
age
and
see
what
shakes
loose
only
a
strong
alcohol
nut
crush
keeps
this
one
from
elite
on
the
drinkability
scale
d
bitter
and
potent
but
its
very
drinkable
its
a
tough
customer
and
you
wont
be
slugging
this
one
back
in
any
short
time
enjoy
this
beer
in
moderation
and
be
thankful
when
you
see
the
end
of
the
glass
its
a
treat
but
damn
its
potent
and
drinkabale
notes
this
one
is
beastly
and
very
devilish
all
in
one
im
glad
i
picked
this
one
for
my
100th
review
if
you
do
not
respect
this
beast
it
will
slay
you
i
recomend
fearing
this
one
to
keep
it
from
slaying
you
what
an
absolutley
kick
ass
beer
or
maybe
i
should
say
a
mastepiece
cheers
dvery
drinkable
despite
alcohol
almost
dangerous
moderate
drinkability
although
i
would
recommend
drinking
this
slow
do
not
underestiimate
the
double
bastard
overall
i
cant
really
tell
if
i
like
this
better
than
ab
or
not
both
are
uncompromising
powerhouses
of
flavor
and
dangerously
drinkable
as
the
bottle
clearly
says
its
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
it
might
not
even
be
for
the
fairly
stout
of
heart
as
im
learning
right
now
ill
defeat
this
one
like
i
did
the
others
but
this
one
put
up
one
hell
of
a
fight
bottle
pours
a
murky
brown
with
a
decent
tan
head
the
head
is
creamy
lasting
and
seems
to
lace
well
has
an
aroma
of
malts
mixed
with
hops
and
some
straw
it
is
a
total
mix
depending
which
hits
you
first
wow
this
has
a
lot
of
flavors
hitting
you
it
sweet
but
yet
that
changes
to
tangy
and
hoppy
within
a
second
has
its
own
presence
about
itself
has
light
carbination
good
mouthfeel
has
a
strong
finish
has
a
heavy
body
the
textureis
thick
like
you
could
eat
it

a
spoon

this
with
some
cracked
black
pepper
water
crackers
and
some
super
sharp
asiago
fantastic
another
great
brew
from
stone
maybe
a
much
better
beer
with
some
age
on
it
but
did
not
meet
all
the
hype
at
all
for
me
full
texture
and
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
with
some
really
impressive
character
the
flavor
is
nicely
balanced
and
you
are
left
satisfied
and
content
not
a
sessioner
in
the
traditional
meaning
of
the
term
but
i
could
drink
these
all
night
poured
from
a
bomber
into
a
pint
glass
big
strong
citrusy
hop
aroma
with
caramel
sweet
thick
malt
aroma
a
touch
of
alcohol
also
noticeable
dense
tan
head
that
recedes
slowly
and
coats
the
sides
of
the
glass
very
nicely
roasted
malts
hit
first
followed
by
a
quick
hit
of
sweet
caramel
and
then
the
big
hop
flavor
plenty
of
supporting
maltiness
and
huge
bitterness
alcohol
comes
to
the
fore
toward
the
finish
before
being
subsumed
with
hop
flavor
and
bitterness
long
after
youve
finished
drinking
youll
still
taste
the
lingering
hops
body
is
quite
full
with
smooth
creamy
mouthfeel
this
one
is
over
the
top
in
all
regards
if
you
like
big
strong
hoppy
bitter
yet
malty
and
sweet
beer
this
one
is
a
must
d
double
bastard
always
changes
year
to
year
as
far
as
drinkability
goes
the
2008
version
is
more
drinkable
to
me
than
previous
editions
id
go
so
far
as
saying
this
one
is
more
drinkable
than
arrogant
bastard
still
definitely
not
one
you
could
throw
back
with
ease
but
you
dont
have
to
work
to
get
through
it
either
mouthfeel
is
great
smooth
and
light
with
a
bit
of
carbonation
despite
the
alcohol
content
i
could
drink
this
stuff
all
day
and
enjoy
all
of
it
i
highly
recommend
this
to
anyone
looking
for
a
double
ipa
drink
up
and
enjoy
d
although
this
beer
tastes
quite
excellent
and
looks
so
nice
put
me
down
for
only
one
bomber
in
a
night
22
oz
of
this
bad
boy
are
perfect
anymore
and
you
sense
will
be
left
numb
and
i
dont
think
you
could
really
appreciate
much
more
22
oz
of
drinkability
but
not
much
more
d
have
to
say
this
is
by
far
the
best
stone
product
ive
had
so
far
no
real
complaints
just
a
nice
big
example
of
an
american
strong
ale
the
body
is
big
and
sweet
add
the
fuselalcohol
notes
i
lean
towards
miss
treatment
of
yeast
but
not
exactly
under
attenuated
and
fusels
do
age
out
overall
a
marketing
beer
that
is
second
to
none
but
for
me
this
is
a
boarderline
us
barleywine
with
some
issue
but
fantastic
caramel
notes
very
drinkable
especially
with
the
10
abv
09
not
reviewing
fresh
a
good
brew
to
drink
and
review
this
rainy
sunday
morning
poured
nice
into
one
of
those
sam
adams
glasses
with
a
2
finger
head
to
the
rim
it
had
that
rich
clear
deep
amber
color
that
i
like
faint
aromas
of
malt
alcohol
hops
tastes
just
fine
with
good
balance
making
it
very
easy
to
drink
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
tastewise
i
preferred
the
second
warmer
glass
i
poured
a
little
more
of
a
hop
finish
here
an
empty
glass
leaves
lacing
only
at
the
top
where
the
head
was
clean
the
rest
of
the
way
down
good
stuff
the
day
is
still
young
what
do
i
follow
this
with
this
one
goes
in
my
all
time
top
5
beers
a
beer
well
worth
the
wait
anything
you
read
about
this
beer
is
true
and
a
sound
purchase
if
you
can
find
it
it
is
becoming
more
and
more
available
then
it
used
to
be
and
from
what
i
learned
from
a
stone
brewing
rep
that
they
ship
it
out
in
the
fall
time
this
might
have
changed
since
then
found
it
at
the
canals
in
hamilton
square
off
of
rt
130
d
i
like
stone
but
this
just
didnt
work
for
me
in
fact
its
kind
of
striking
how
og
manages
to
be
both
bigger
and
more
drinkable
this
is
easily
my
least
favorite
of
the
bastards
i
havent
officially
reviewed
the
other
two
yet
but
id
rank
them
as
follows
oaked
arrogant
double
now
an
oaked
double
bastard
thats
something
i
wouldnt
mind
checking
out
until
i
drank
this
beer
i
didnt
realize
that
i
was
such
a
masochist
im
glad
that
stone
is
out
there
to
teach
me
such
valuable
life
lessons
dark
brown
pour
with
a
thick
and
frost
head
with
nice
lacing
left
behind
big
citrus
and
caramel
aroma
with
a
similar
flavor
alcohol
very
prominent
but
not
unpleasantly
so
always
a
fun
beer
to
trick
your
friends
into
drinking
without
being
properly
prepared
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
its
very
interesting
and
an
unusual
balance
its
also
got
a
big
booze
kick
its
strong
and
pretty
damned
tasty
glad
ive
tried
it
but
not
necessarily
my
alltime
favorite
the
alcohol
is
massive
in
db
usually
i
rate
less
well
if
i
get
a
large
alcohol
presence
especially
in
strong
ales
im
an
english
style
old
ale
lover
but
here
the
craft
of
the
brewer
is
magnificent
the
vapor
of
it
sends
the
swirling
milieu
of
flavor
perfectly
into
a
river
of
changing
delight
climaxing
in
an
incredibly
long
finish
that
lingers
until
the
next
sip
be
that
sip
ten
minutes
later
it
is
an
achievement
a
masterpiece
i
cant
give
higher
praise
for
this
champion
imho
of
this
style
i
hope
to
taste
a
better
one
than
this
but
i
doubt
i
will
an
enormous
beer
this
baby
will
kick
your
ass
huge
malt
profile
accompanied
by
a
huge
hop
profile
im
amazed
by
the
onetwo
of
all
malt
then
all
hop
very
unique
extremely
smooth
and
drinkable
unlike
the
120
minute
i
would
love
to
try
this
fresh
as
im
sure
there
would
be
a
great
hop
aroma
that
isnt
present
here
definitely
recommend
definitely
a
sipper
what
a
great
beer
to
sip
as
i
pack
and
get
ready
for
a
trip
to
the
dominican
republic
this
2008
batch
pours
out
a
deep
rusty
amber
color
with
a
slightly
offwhite
head
lacing
is
quite
impressive
as
it
clings
to
my
delirium
snifter
slight
sediment
at
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
the
aroma
candylike
with
strong
notes
of
caramelized
sugars
and
hop
spiciness
a
little
more
subdued
than
i
expected
but
pleasant
the
taste
brings
together
a
sense
of
ipa
meets
barleywine
in
a
harmonious
blend
the
richness
of
the
malts
and
the
sharpness
of
the
hops
comes
together
wonderfully
but
not
at
all
unbalanced
unlike
others
in
this
style
that
lean
to
heavy
towards
the
hops
this
one
pulls
in
multitudes
of
depth
while
remaining
tethered
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
thinner
than
i
would
guess
for
a
beer
of
this
nature
and
statue
the
hoppiness
leaves
a
pleasant
dryness
to
the
otherwise
sweet
body
drinkability
is
truly
lethal
on
this
at
10
5
it
is
tough
to
realize
how
strong
it
is
until
it
is
too
late
well
done
and
superbly
crafted
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
light
and
the
finish
is
very
nicely
balanced
between
spicy
dry
and
sweet
intriguing
im
going
to
say
that
this
stands
up
to
bells
old
ale
but
id
take
bells
over
this
this
bottle
was
transported
by
car
about
a
week
ago
and
from
the
look
of
it
it
hasnt
quite
settled
down
yet
there
is
a
murky
reddishbrown
hue
to
it
with
minute
suspended
particles
that
suggest
plum
puree
to
me
the
head
is
fleeting
but
a
thin
veil
remains
atop
the
prunelike
nectar
the
smell
is
big
hoppy
spirited
caramel
sweet
toffee
very
reminiscent
of
a
barleywine
the
taste
is
similarly
big
with
layers
of
caramel
heat
in
the
mouth
sour
dark
fruit
very
long
drawn
out
aftertaste
with
flashes
of
bitter
malty
liquer
more
caramel
more
malt
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
smooth
but
for
me
the
alcohol
remains
front
and
center
the
label
says
in
part
not
to
be
wasted
on
the
tentative
or
weak
and
it
makes
me
wonder
where
i
fit
in
its
almost
too
much
for
me
barleywines
have
never
been
my
favourite
beerstyle
although
i
respect
them
and
in
this
case
the
10
per
cent
abv
is
reasonably
well
kept
in
check
but
make
no
mistake
a
strong
ale
like
this
is
never
to
be
taken
lightly
ive
been
sipping
my
half
of
the
big
bottle
for
well
over
an
hour
and
while
im
appreciating
it
more
as
i
go
along
id
be
loathe
to
recommend
this
to
a
novice
for
the
experienced
beer
lover
this
pushes
the
envelope
big
time
and
its
a
trip
you
owe
yourself
complex
thrilling
entertaining
and
not
soon
to
be
forgotten
dont
listen
to
that
write
up
go
home
with
a
bottle
whether
you
feel
worthy
or
not
if
you
are
worthy
youll
certainly
appreciate
it
and
if
you
arent
you
soon
will
be
double
bastard
is
at
least
twice
as
good
as
most
beers
on
the
shelves
a
beer
like
this
really
raises
ones
standards
about
what
they
put
in
their
body
and
how
they
choose
to
spend
their
money
drinkability
scarily
drinkable
considering
the
10
5
percent
alcohol
its
so
soft
smooth
and
delicious
you
want
more
and
more
with
each
sip
a
classic
beer
to
me
one
to
savor
each
sip
i
could
find
a
flaw
what
so
ever
in
this
beer
to
be
honest
so
well
rounded
and
yet
so
complex
hard
to
put
into
words
just
how
good
this
beer
is
infact
i
feel
me
trying
to
describe
it
now
isnt
doing
it
justice
if
you
like
the
regular
bastard
try
the
double
its
like
the
ultra
reserve
of
whats
already
a
reserve
enjoy
you
wont
regret
it
pours
a
very
dark
red
brown
color
produces
about
a
two
finger
head
that
goes
down
quick
but
leaves
plenty
of
lacing
down
the
glass
the
aroma
is
a
little
hoppy
but
the
hops
dont
jump
out
and
the
smell
is
also
kind
of
sweet
like
caramel
the
taste
is
great
very
smooth
and
sweet
its
hoppy
but
not
extremely
hoppy
which
i
do
like
but
in
this
case
not
extremely
hoppy
is
really
good
it
has
a
bit
of
bitterness
to
it
and
overall
the
taste
is
great
for
such
a
high
alcohol
content
its
masked
very
nicely
and
i
could
easily
and
would
love
to
drink
a
couple
of
these
poured
a
murky
brown
body
that
had
a
twofinger
offwhite
head
taht
died
slowly
and
left
lace
down
the
glass
the
smell
is
strong
and
simply
put
it
is
a
mix
of
sweet
malts
and
floral
hops
that
i
will
dwelve
into
in
the
taste
smooth
and
creamy
is
my
first
impression
of
this
almost
fullbodied
beer
there
are
malt
notes
in
the
taste
like
caramel
roasted
and
maybe
even
some
toastedburny
malts
could
be
coffee
that
mix
with
a
strong
dose
of
citric
and
floral
hops
this
is
the
stone
brewery
afterall
it
leads
to
a
drying
somewhat
tastebud
killing
sweet
and
nutty
taste
mixed
with
fruits
and
the
abv
makes
itself
appreciated
on
the
backend
as
there
is
a
minor
warming
alkie
burn
as
you
finish
this
bottom
line
this
beer
encompasses
both
extreme
sweet
and
roasted
malts
and
bitter
hop
sensations
for
a
complex
beer
that
at
10
5
abv
gave
me
a
buzz
after
one
bomber
and
is
dangerous
bc
i
killed
the
bomber
quick
it
was
so
good
pours
a
copper
amber
color
with
an
offwhite
head
that
sticks
around
for
awhile
smells
very
sweet
getting
lots
of
caramel
malts
in
this
one
very
little
hop
presence
in
this
one
taste
very
similar
to
smell
very
malty
and
sweet
and
caramel
there
is
a
more
noticeable
hop
presence
on
the
finish
of
this
one
im
surprised
at
the
lack
of
hoppiness
in
this
brew
from
stones
good
carbonation
but
the
sweetness
of
this
one
is
a
little
much
meh
the
regular
bastard
is
much
more
balanced
and
nuanced
this
beer
will
make
you
rethink
your
life
i
read
the
back
of
the
bottle
while
watching
television
and
felt
like
i
was
committing
some
sort
of
heresy
against
the
brewing
gods
those
stone
guys
are
so
arrogant
that
one
might
feel
completely
undeserving
of
even
a
sip
of
their
beer
their
commitment
to
making
quality
beer
and
letting
the
customer
know
about
it
combined
with
the
sexiest
bottle
out
there
makes
this
a
good
experience
before
you
even
open
the
bottle
now
on
to
the
beer
it
pours
a
nice
copper
color
with
an
offwhite
head
that
didnt
hang
around
too
long
and
didnt
leave
much
lacing
coulda
been
the
lighting
but
i
thought
it
was
a
bit
hazy
also
smells
of
alcohol
and
citrus
kinda
sweet
in
a
liquor
sort
of
way
extremely
full
mouthfeel
each
sip
felt
like
more
than
it
actually
was
taste
is
of
strong
alcohol
and
hop
bitterness
with
a
peppery
bite
at
the
back
of
the
throat
the
malt
takes
over
towards
the
end
i
know
this
is
lacking
in
description
but
its
a
very
delicious
beer
overall
i
really
liked
this
beer
the
smell
could
have
been
more
potent
to
me
everything
else
was
very
good
it
could
have
had
a
bit
more
malt
to
the
taste
and
drinkability
is
only
hindered
by
the
strength
of
alcohol
and
taste
my
mouth
is
going
numb
excellent
effort
from
stone
d
pretty
damn
drinkable
considering
the
size
of
this
monster
one
will
be
more
than
plenty
and
very
tasty
the
mouthfeel
is
perfect
excellent
carbonation
a
rounded
bitterness
and
just
enough
body
all
of
these
factors
combine
to
completely
hide
the
alcohol
extremely
well
done
this
beer
is
as
drinkable
as
they
come
so
be
careful
another
worldclass
offering
by
the
lovely
people
at
stone
double
bastard
was
dark
caramel
in
color
and
i
caught
the
aroma
of
it
even
before
i
put
my
nose
up
to
it
beautiful
it
presented
a
malty
mochaness
taste
with
a
thick
tingly
mouthfeel
due
to
overcarbonation
this
is
a
fine
brew
and
would
definitely
drink
again
almost
seems
like
a
special
occasion
type
of
beer
drinkability
such
a
wonderfully
balanced
ale
makes
me
wish
i
had
another
bottle
if
it
werent
for
the
high
abv
i
think
this
would
make
a
nice
session
beer
wow
this
is
a
huge
beer
something
that
would
do
well
to
lay
down
maybe
a
little
longer
pours
a
reddish
brown
color
body
clearish
big
tan
head
lasting
sweet
caramel
aroma
not
as
hoppy
as
the
original
somewhat
grapey
effervescent
caramel
taste
not
as
hoppy
sweet
malty
caustic
taste
some
hops
dry
drinkability
given
the
high
abv
drinkability
will
be
limited
but
damn
is
this
good
great
drinkability
overall
at
this
point
in
time
this
would
be
my
goto
beer
from
stone
22
oz
bomber
poured
into
a
pint
glass
poured
thick
out
of
the
glass
bottle
color
of
deep
burgundy
with
some
caramel
colored
head
that
dissipated
somewhat
quickly
some
lacing
can
be
noticed
served
garaged
temped
ice
cold
smells
of
sweet
maltiness
sugary
nutty
tones
and
a
liberal
dose
of
hops
in
toe
intense
malt
at
the
beginning
followed
by
a
major
blast
of
those
killer
hops
to
finish
its
big
thick
as
oil
sticky
and
a
nice
lacing
on
the
palate
which
is
favorable
to
say
the
least
great
sipper
a
stellar
winter
warmer
with
no
question
abv
is
noticeable
but
not
distracting
recommended
the
those
who
enjoy
the
big
ones
arrogance
is
bliss
overall
an
awesome
brew
that
can
be
drank
all
night
and
often
everyone
should
try
this
brew
drinkability
is
a
tough
one
to
grade
on
one
hand
i
ended
up
drinking
this
bomber
by
myself
and
i
loved
it
i
could
and
would
drink
another
if
i
had
it
on
the
other
hand
it
is
ten
and
a
half
percent
and
a
huge
beer
with
tons
of
flavor
do
you
really
need
two
or
more
absolutely
not
respect
beer
and
keep
it
at
one
bomber
side
note
stone
brewing
oompany
maked
the
most
creative
bottles
in
the
business
art
work
and
design
is
superb
d
its
more
drinkable
than
arrogant
bastard
and
it
does
taste
better
but
im
not
big
into
hops
so
bravo
dvery
very
much
so
a
couple
of
bites
of
trader
joes
dark
chocolate
made
it
neither
better
nor
worse
just
different
i
almost
want
to
try
this
with
thai
food
then
mexican
etc
etc
one
of
the
great
ones
mfd
perfect
no
complaints
subtle
crisp
carbonation
with
creamy
soothe
body
and
perfectly
viscous
drinkability
another
incredible
winner
from
stone
this
was
as
impressive
as
its
reputation
ive
had
most
of
stones
biggies
ipa
ris
bastard
and
i
can
say
im
officially
a
huge
fan
and
have
yet
to
be
disappointed
this
is
definitely
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
as
the
bottle
states
and
not
an
everyday
drinker
but
you
should
definitely
go
out
of
your
way
to
try
this
amazing
brew
im
sure
ill
fondly
return
to
it
in
the
future
flawless
mouthfeel
with
great
carbonation
that
punches
your
taste
buds
but
finishes
dry
and
crisp
d
it
seems
too
obvious
to
say
but
this
is
really
just
a
bigger
version
of
the
regular
arrogant
bastard
ale
and
i
mean
that
as
a
compliment
same
great
taste
just
intensified
a
bit
and
with
higher
alcohol
presence
despite
the
unflinching
alcohol
presence
this
is
still
a
damned
drinkable
ale
i
really
liked
this
beer
and
will
have
more
every
chance
i
get
d
a
good
tasting
beer
very
nicely
balanced
reminiscent
of
some
barley
wines
the
big
flavor
and
high
alcohol
make
this
a
nice
sipper
or
one
to
split
with
friends
easy
to
drink
in
spite
of
its
alcohol
content
i
prefer
this
to
its
little
brother
another
great
beer
from
the
sb
group
though
i
wish
this
was
brewed
all
year
around
though
i
do
get
excited
every
year
for
the
double
bastard
release
this
beer
has
a
nice
finish
it
has
a
nice
bite
but
is
not
overwhelming
in
its
texture
it
is
just
right
is
its
combination
and
is
very
mush
the
brew
worth
the
wait
drinkability
is
good
too
good
the
sweetness
and
strong
taste
make
this
a
sipper
but
it
goes
down
way
better
than
a
10
5
beer
should
feel
if
i
didnt
know
what
i
was
drinking
i
would
have
had
much
more
very
nice
2009
poured
into
a
pint
thin
nose
of
bready
yeast
and
burnt
caramel
with
some
floral
sweetness
deep
red
with
a
thin
white
head
that
quickly
fades
the
taste
is
an
all
out
assault
on
all
fronts
hops
pierce
the
tongue
in
a
million
tiny
darts
of
piny
floral
wonderfulness
malt
rules
with
a
deep
caramel
and
molasses
sweetness
backed
by
an
overburnt
coffee
bitter
tang
some
fruity
tones
balance
all
and
leave
you
wanting
more
after
the
swallow
the
throbbing
burn
of
the
hops
is
matched
by
the
warm
glow
of
the
malt
sweetness
the
alcohol
glow
is
noticeable
and
welcome
a
10
5abv
that
drinks
like
a
6
i
prefer
this
to
its
soft
single
cousin
what
a
bastard
taste
is
big
smooth
malts
with
a
huge
grapefruit
and
pine
blend
that
makes
it
all
drink
like
a
neighborhood
lager
at
the
corner
bar
feel
is
somewhat
heavy
and
syrupy
superb
carbonation
is
microfine
and
omnipresent
it
allows
what
should
be
too
much
to
become
exemplary
drinkability
is
the
benchmark
for
the
style
if
you
take
the
glass
to
your
lips
you
are
warned
this
stuff
drinks
like
water
and
kicks
like
a
mule
or
mustang
overall
im
glad
i
tried
this
beer
not
the
best
beer
in
the
world
but
a
solid
beer
nonetheless
copper
colour
cloudy
small
tan
head
creates
a
lid
lacing
aroma
is
sweet
dark
fruit
honey
jam
almost
vinous
noticable
abv
reminiscant
of
belgian
quadrupels
flavour
is
more
hoppy
than
the
aroma
indicated
dark
fruit
spices
hops
mouthfeel
is
lively
but
quite
smooth
very
complex
but
yet
easy
to
drink
my
second
beer
from
stone
and
they
impress
me
again
overall
the
mouth
feel
is
astringent
and
slightly
carbonated
a
medium
finish
that
is
bitter
by
hops
this
beer
is
huge
there
is
a
lot
going
on
with
such
a
few
ingredients
there
is
subtle
sweetness
but
you
really
cant
tell
the
alcohol
is
in
the
beer
stone
makes
some
damn
fine
brews
i
like
this
beer
better
than
the
original
arrogant
bastard
i
will
be
sipping
this
for
while
there
is
not
much
to
critique
all
around
a
great
brew
nice
red
color
cloudy
fruity
nose
taste
of
fruit
mixed
with
a
little
caramel
big
long
finish
a
little
too
much
alcohol
present
but
not
overwhelming
very
clean
feel
in
my
mouth
the
alcohol
warmed
my
belly
and
numbed
my
senses
i
enjoyed
this
ale
but
one
was
all
i
needed
d
high
a
b
v
warming
but
a
bit
overwhelming
wouldnt
include
this
one
in
a
session
from
bootleggers
in
topsham
a
new
favorite
store
with
a
great
selection
pours
dark
brown
extremly
hazy
very
little
head
smells
slightly
piney
malty
tastes
quite
piney
bitter
citrusy
slightly
malty
in
the
background
it
isnt
as
hoppy
as
expected
maybe
slightly
less
so
than
arrogant
bastard
overall
though
i
really
do
like
it
im
glad
stone
is
available
in
maine
and
this
beer
is
a
nice
traat
enjoy
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
the
alcohol
will
be
your
limiting
factor
i
can
easily
say
that
i
would
be
drunk
before
i
got
my
fill
of
this
well
crafted
ale
the
great
flavors
with
a
smooth
character
is
dangerous
the
mouthfeel
is
chewy
and
thick
remains
on
the
palate
for
must
a
smidge
this
baby
is
a
slooow
sipper
might
as
well
be
a
heavy
barleywine
a
real
thick
choker
but
a
heck
of
a
good
beer
i
still
really
enjoyed
this
beer
though
very
good
very
delicious
definitely
recommended
cheers
d
this
is
a
very
unique
brew
that
does
not
fit
into
style
guidelines
it
is
delicious
but
very
potent
and
a
little
hard
to
drink
d
an
excellent
beer
that
is
great
to
pour
in
to
a
glass
and
sip
on
and
enjoy
the
package
store
that
i
work
at
just
sold
the
last
few
about
a
week
ago
which
upsets
me
because
i
didnt
get
to
grab
one
more
before
they
come
back
i
love
this
beer
and
am
lucky
enough
to
have
more
of
it
its
everything
i
want
in
a
strong
hoppy
beer
it
smells
like
grapefruit
sweetness
from
honey
piney
scents
the
taste
is
even
better
because
it
matches
the
scent
dead
on
coats
your
tongue
like
honey
would
and
then
the
tastes
start
coming
out
piney
bitterness
tart
from
the
citrus
fruits
then
a
lingering
sweetness
this
is
a
worldclass
beer
in
my
opinion
the
only
problem
is
the
10
5
it
sneaks
up
on
you
good
beer
with
a
moderate
alcohol
finish
mouthfeel
is
very
big
a
bit
sticky
moderate
carbonation
not
too
thick
chewy
good
beer
very
interesting
balance
do
this
is
easily
my
favorite
american
strong
ale
it
has
great
characteristics
all
across
the
board
and
has
great
drinkability
be
careful
though
after
a
few
of
these
you
wont
be
able
to
feel
your
legs
well
done
you
crazy
bastards
cheers
a
next
time
ive
had
a
hard
week
and
just
need
to
get
popped
in
the
mouth
im
going
down
to
my
local
liquor
store
and
pick
up
a
40
ouncer
of
the
cheapest
malt
liquor
i
can
find
i
poured
from
a
22
ounce
bottle
into
a
tulip
glass
it
pours
a
deep
orange
with
a
solid
white
head
the
lacing
is
left
all
over
the
glass
the
aroma
is
candied
fruit
with
alcohol
overtones
the
flavor
is
heavy
on
dark
fruit
with
an
alcohol
finish
the
beer
is
a
full
bodied
sipper
i
have
been
sipping
at
it
for
about
an
hour
now
and
it
has
improved
as
it
warms
drinkability
is
outstanding
if
you
can
handle
the
excessive
abv
that
stone
has
provided
with
this
offering
overall
this
is
a
really
good
beer
and
probably
the
most
drinkalbe
10
abv
beer
ive
had
d
better
than
i
remembered
after
having
it
a
few
years
ago
hadnt
really
gone
back
to
it
because
it
didnt
blow
me
away
the
first
time
and
its
really
high
in
alcohol
but
this
was
very
very
good
very
drinkable
evocative
of
a
barleywine
maybe
overhyped
a
bit
but
a
nice
big
beer
this
beer
is
a
touch
hot
which
is
fine
for
an
afterdinner
drink
but
it
may
not
be
malty
enough
to
be
used
exclusively
as
a
sipper
in
my
opinion
a
great
beer
with
amazing
hop
character
but
i
think
the
arrogant
bastard
may
be
the
better
of
these
two
evils
though
i
wish
i
could
bring
myself
to
like
this
beer
but
i
cant
the
alcohol
muddles
all
of
the
fruit
flavors
and
the
hops
are
way
out
of
control
out
of
control
not
in
a
hopbomb
kind
of
way
but
in
a
sickly
sweet
alpha
acid
juice
kind
of
way
way
too
young
to
drink
definitely
needs
some
age
on
it
could
be
a
great
beer
in
the
future
but
right
now
im
not
a
fan
very
high
drinkability
given
the
abv
if
i
tasted
this
blind
i
would
peg
it
as
a
dipa
tons
of
hops
and
they
are
tasty
a
total
palate
destroyer
but
in
a
good
way
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
but
it
can
catch
up
with
you
fast
at
10
5
this
is
a
good
beer
enjoyable
on
a
lot
of
level
but
not
perfect
it
is
for
sipping
slowly
and
savoring
the
sting
of
alcohol
somewhat
limits
its
appeal
taste
makes
me
want
to
cry
full
and
complex
smooth
a
fantastic
hop
finish
just
enough
bitterness
to
make
me
come
crawling
back
for
more
its
so
good
i
want
to
crack
open
my
other
bottle
but
i
cant
its
an
07
i
will
just
have
to
pick
up
some
more
at
winter
storm
a
fantastic
offering
i
just
wasnt
that
into
it
a
long
time
favorite
of
mine
this
was
a
2005
hoping
to
start
breaking
into
the
2006s
pretty
soon
you
gotta
try
this
if
you
get
the
chance
but
be
careful
a
very
strong
brew
hoppy
and
complex
yet
enjoyable
if
you
know
what
to
expect
from
a
classic
stone
beer
with
a
kick
i
will
have
it
again
and
enjoy
it
on
evenings
when
i
only
want
1
beer
and
that
1
beer
that
will
do
me
in
for
the
night
and
always
impress
my
palette
this
is
really
too
smooth
and
creamy
the
only
thing
holding
this
from
being
an
exceptional
easy
drinking
beer
is
the
alcohol
which
almost
kicks
you
like
a
barleywine
overall
its
a
nice
drink
its
not
really
a
hop
beer
like
again
a
dipa
or
such
it
is
quite
bitter
though
a
dark
copper
color
with
a
fair
off
white
cover
and
plenty
of
lacing
left
over
the
aroma
says
deep
nutty
malt
and
herbal
piney
hops
a
mellow
delicious
scent
full
of
brown
sugar
sweetness
with
a
hint
of
alcohol
the
taste
is
stick
to
your
ribs
licorice
malt
and
herbal
hops
a
beautiful
full
bodied
dipa
type
flavor
with
hints
of
chocolate
and
toffee
sweetness
this
is
a
gutsy
brew
thoroughly
satisfying
quality
stuff
as
one
expects
from
stone
this
is
undeniable
stuff
necessarily
quite
drinkable
drinkability
definitely
a
sipper
because
of
the
high
abv
this
beer
is
enjoyable
but
i
would
probably
stick
to
just
one
i
understand
that
strong
ales
are
going
to
have
a
fairly
strong
alcohol
note
but
i
dont
think
the
double
bastard
does
a
good
enough
job
of
handling
that
especially
as
it
warms
ill
put
it
this
way
by
the
end
the
alcohol
notes
came
across
less
like
a
good
scotch
and
more
like
a
shot
of
cheap
whiskey
bastard
the
double
indeed
beggars
cant
be
choosers
but
man
what
this
would
be
like
oaked
like
the
single
bastard
d
double
bastard
is
no
session
beer
by
any
means
a
22
oz
bottle
at
a
time
is
all
one
needs
very
tasty
though
if
you
can
find
it
buy
a
bottle
its
definitely
worth
the
taste
overall
a
really
excellent
beer
and
worthy
of
the
high
praise
my
only
knock
would
be
that
at
10
5
abv
im
not
going
to
have
more
than
one
at
a
time
and
if
i
start
the
evening
with
this
one
than
my
tongue
and
senses
are
too
dulled
to
really
appreciate
other
beers
for
me
this
has
to
be
the
only
beer
of
the
evening
that
i
want
to
really
taste
anything
after
this
is
going
to
be
filler
highly
recommend
another
great
one
from
stone
brazen
darkly
opaque
brown
body
with
a
thick
offwhite
head
that
clings
reasonably
well
to
its
snifter
nice
spooky
ghostlike
lacing
as
its
body
drains
spruce
and
spice
rush
to
arrest
the
senses
fresh
fruity
esthers
bolster
the
rush
with
an
engaging
connection
the
alcohol
is
noted
in
the
heat
at
the
throat
teeth
rattle
as
double
bastard
is
chewed
otherwise
body
behaves
as
an
ipa
should
upon
first
sip
one
wonders
the
ibus
needed
to
make
this
run
second
sip
brings
a
sweetness
to
the
lips
and
a
bitterness
that
lingers
minutes
after
difficult
to
gage
the
effects
of
this
as
the
expectation
and
the
affectation
blur
in
the
experience
i
just
feel
i
am
drinking
something
important
here
ignoring
the
rather
silly
diatribe
on
the
bottle
a
shoutout
to
brother
jer
for
gifting
me
with
three
3
of
these
for
christmastime
d
good
but
not
a
very
good
example
for
a
strong
ale
note
after
reviewing
i
skimmed
the
other
reviews
it
seems
strange
how
some
people
describe
this
beer
as
cloudy
while
others
like
myself
see
it
as
completely
clear
would
aging
or
bottling
dates
really
make
that
much
of
a
difference
d
good
but
not
a
very
good
example
for
a
strong
ale
all
in
all
a
beer
i
will
be
drinking
again
this
is
one
damn
deceptively
drinkable
bastard
and
the
10
5
is
a
backstabber
for
sure
either
way
this
one
can
be
sipped
or
quaffed
but
drinker
beware
a
headache
may
await
the
morning
after
this
is
a
great
beer
to
have
if
you
are
sick
of
drinking
bmc
maybe
you
were
at
a
wedding
and
thats
all
they
had
a
full
out
assalt
but
it
works
and
is
delicious
d
pretty
drinkable
its
a
big
beer
so
it
is
harder
to
have
a
lot
of
it
dark
ambermahogany
pour
with
an
offwhite
head
aroma
is
like
a
hopbombed
barley
wine
the
mouthfeel
was
very
thick
maybe
the
most
viscous
beer
i
have
ever
drank
the
flavor
was
the
stereotypical
stone
hops
along
with
caramel
malts
and
dark
fruits
d
excellent
drinkability
considering
the
alchoholic
heft
of
this
beer
although
the
good
people
at
stone
would
probably
take
issue
with
my
phrasing
i
would
say
this
is
one
of
their
most
balanced
beers
its
got
a
lot
of
big
flavors
in
it
but
neither
the
hops
nor
the
alchohol
overpower
the
other
flavors
thank
god
for
dba
stone
is
king
d
drinkability
was
good
i
thought
much
smoother
and
refined
then
the
original
bastard
a
dark
ale
that
was
rich
malty
and
arrogant
yet
somehow
very
smooth
and
easy
to
put
down
despite
its
abv
been
waiting
a
long
time
to
try
this
beer
and
it
was
well
worth
it
pours
a
slightly
murky
and
thick
deep
amber
color
creating
a
creamy
and
dense
offwhite
head
head
retention
was
a
bit
weak
with
only
some
spotty
foam
and
little
lacing
just
fantastic
complex
aromas
of
balanced
malt
and
hop
contributions
with
notes
of
dark
roasted
caramels
brown
sugar
toffee
vanilla
citrus
rinds
and
spice
palate
was
perfect
big
full
round
and
smooth
very
fine
carbonation
bubbles
keep
the
beer
velvety
slick
flavor
is
just
immense
and
rich
with
a
nice
balance
struck
with
the
sweet
malts
and
hoppy
bitterness
flavors
start
out
with
notes
of
sweet
dark
brown
sugar
raisin
caramel
and
toffee
gradually
slides
into
a
medium
bitter
hop
contribution
with
crisp
fresh
notes
of
grapefruit
orange
and
pine
alcohol
is
fairly
muscular
but
not
hot
or
intrusive
just
a
fantastic
brew
in
all
aspects
taste
is
remarkable
assertively
hoppy
and
spicy
characteristics
like
an
imperial
ipa
but
theres
also
this
darkfruity
winelike
complexity
that
reminds
me
of
a
strong
belgian
ale
its
kind
of
like
a
hopheads
version
of
a
quad
very
spicy
pretty
damn
malty
sweet
brown
sugar
and
alcoholic
yet
surprisingly
easy
to
drink
probably
because
its
so
delicious
mouthfeel
is
excellent
smooth
with
coating
of
the
tongue
definite
lacing
on
the
way
down
this
really
is
an
awesome
beer
one
of
the
finest
from
stone
brewing
personal
points
made
was
this
seemed
like
a
brown
ale
crossed
with
a
dipa
just
didnt
really
mesh
for
me
im
either
in
the
mood
for
one
or
the
other
and
are
too
different
in
respects
to
crave
both
at
the
same
time
the
alchohol
was
hidden
fairly
well
one
of
my
favorites
from
stone
i
think
with
the
following
that
aba
has
that
the
daba
should
be
a
year
round
offering
d
one
bomber
is
enough
its
a
very
intense
beer
easy
enough
to
finish
but
i
think
id
rather
have
two
arrogant
bastards
than
one
of
these
d
sooo
are
we
talkin
imperial
strong
ale
here
many
characteristics
make
me
think
barleywine
and
it
definitely
drinks
like
one
but
whatevers
clever
dangerous
on
an
empty
stomach
although
the
alcohol
is
noticeable
it
doesnt
really
affect
the
greatness
of
this
beer
this
brew
is
packed
full
of
exceptional
flavor
very
complex
and
pleasing
quality
and
quantity
of
flavor
in
each
sip
are
astonishing
pours
a
clear
amberbrown
with
a
minimal
grey
head
aroma
is
lightly
sweet
with
grapefruit
cherry
flowers
and
caramel
the
flavor
is
floral
hop
grapefruity
hop
cherries
toffee
orange
and
light
cinnamon
medium

very
pleasant
light
creamy
texture
finishes
very
hoppy

976
reviews
as
of
this
posting
ever
feel
like
you
were
late
to
the
party
its
big
brass
hoppy
but
not
over
bitter
or
over
boozy
with
all
that
said
theres
a
balance
which
i
enjoyed
from
start
to
finish
its
a
great
example
of
an
american
strong
ale
worth
a
try
if
youre
late
to
the
party
like
me
where
the
ab
is
more
balanced
db
is
much
more
aggressively
hopped
high
in
abv
and
with
all
these
hops
it
will
slow
you
down
a
definite
sipper
personally
i
think
american
strong
ales
are
a
bit
of
a
crap
shoot
and
are
hard
to
pin
down
what
a
standard
or
average
asa
should
be
notes
damn
this
one
will
put
some
hair
on
your
chest
this
is
one
big
bad
ass
american
strong
ale
not
be
reckoned
with
it
gorilla
pimp
slaps
you
from
the
start
and
leaves
you
beggin
for
more
another
outstanding
brew
from
the
good
folks
at
stone
highly
recommended
d
this
is
yet
another
well
made
drinkable
beer
from
stone
very
flavorful
and
easy
to
drink
this
beer
rates
a
perfect
in
drinkability
i
want
gallons
and
gallons
of
this
beer
its
perfect
as
a
thirst
quencher
a
session
beer
or
something
to
try
for
the
first
time
on
a
chilly
winter
night
perfect
in
sips
or
quaffs
a
warming
bloom
of
alcohol
and
a
slight
slur
accompany
the
bottom
of
the
22oz
bottle
good
drinkability
due
to
the
flavor
but
i
wouldnt
want
to
have
more
than
maybe
2
bombers
in
a
night
unless
i
want
to
end
up
on
the
floor
poured
a
hazy
caramel
color
but
sits
more
brownishred
in
the
glasswith
a
light
tannish
head
nose
is
deep
malts
caramel
toffee
flowery
and
mustard
although
massive
in
flavor
the
taste
is
very
balanced
with
oranges
red
apples
beef
jerky
maple
syrup
to
represent
some
heavliy
guarded
sweetness
the
finish
is
very
piney
resinous
hops
while
the
mouthfeel
is
inviting
and
mesmerizing
it
does
prohibit
you
from
drinking
much
of
this
the
hops
are
incredibly
full
and
bulky
that
said
its
a
fantastic
fantastic
brew
d
this
is
a
really
solid
brew
however
i
feel
like
it
has
not
reached
its
full
potential
the
flavors
are
somewhat
subdued
and
seem
like
there
should
be
more
going
on
still
a
recommended
brew
but
possibly
better
with
aging
notes
this
is
liquid
ecstasy
man
i
could
really
die
for
this
pick
this
up
you
wont
be
disappointed
wow
where
do
i
start
this
beer
is
everything
i
had
heard
and
more
reminded
me
of
a
barleywine
and
i
had
to
sip
this
beer
in
order
to
saver
every
drop
an
intense
beer
not
to
be
taken
lightly
i
grew
up
in
san
diego
and
i
wish
we
had
stone
back
then
enjoy
this
stone
offering
poured
from
a
bomber
shows
a
ruby
copper
liquid
with
a
nominal
splotchy
head
not
much
lacing
going
on
as
this
goes
down
smell
is
earthy
hops
over
a
back
ground
of
sugary
unripe
fruits
doughy
bread
taste
is
a
strong
piney
and
citrus
hop
contingent
some
pleasant
green
apple
notes
a
yeasty
alcohol
bite
makes
its
presence
known
mouthfeel
is
big
and
bold
but
not
chewy
and
cloying
the
10
5
that
this
brew
packs
is
noticeable
but
it
remains
fairly
drinkable
a
great
night
cap
when
given
the
chance
i
will
review
this
beer
fresh
to
see
how
this
beer
pours
a
cloudy
amber
color
with
a
small
offwhite
head
smells
piny
and
citrusy
with
dark
fruits
figs
prunes
raisins
and
apples
the
taste
is
extraordinarily
complex
with
citrus
flavors
caramel
rasins
vanilla
and
alcohol
the
mouthfeel
is
incredibly
smooth
and
is
nicely
carbonated
drinkability
is
high
considering
the
outrageous
abv
i
split
this
with
my
dad
but
wish
i
would
of
saved
the
whole
bottle
for
myself
i
am
not
worthy
pours
a
dark
brown
with
almost
no
head
the
smell
is
robust
and
burly
you
can
definetly
smell
the
alcohol
the
taste
is
malts
quickly
followed
by
a
nice
sense
of
hops
the
alcohol
burn
ever
present
this
is
a
sipper
beer
and
you
would
be
harded
pressed
to
drink
more
then
one
or
two
its
a
good
beer
just
not
my
favorite
nothing
stands
out
and
says
look
at
me
i
am
special
everything
about
this
beer
is
amplified
so
its
a
beer
with
a
strong
personality
but
that
personality
even
though
strong
is
kinda
generic
drinkability
merry
christmas
to
me
having
cellared
this
for
four
years
i
didnt
much
care
for
the
young
arrogant
bastard
puts
flak
jacket
on
but
this
with
age
is
sublime
opaque
amber
hue
with
white
frothy
head
that
dissipates
quickly
sweet
liquor
aroma
tries
to
ward
me
off
but
i
cant
resist
strong
taste
of
thick
toffee
alcohol
and
liquor
sweetness
its
a
strange
sour
syrup
that
has
fine
taste
but
you
know
could
end
your
night
pretty
quick
if
you
indulge
too
much
heavy
bodied
with
strong
arrogant
personality
and
a
high
alcohol
and
chewiness
that
makes
it
a
sipper
approach
with
caution
for
this
dude
is
an
evil
one
these
big
ales
aint
the
best
for
looks
no
head
and
light
lacing
thats
fine
im
accustomed
to
these
heavy
hitters
looking
modest
smells
of
sweet
malt
and
white
grape
tastes
of
thick
chewy
malt
imperial
ipa
foundation
hops
balance
the
huge
grain
bill
never
puffing
out
their
chests
notes
of
spicy
malt
oak
wood
toffee
and
deep
caramel
sappy
wood
disguises
the
booze
this
brewery
shall
be
the
head
corner
stone
taste
is
creamy
somewhat
sour
light
grapefruit
caramel
bitterness
that
grows
as
you
drink
and
dry
leaves
end
is
nicely
bitter
and
thick
this
beer
is
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
its
definitely
a
strong
motha
of
a
brew
best
decision
i
have
made
at
the
liquor
store
this
year
almost
wanted
to
weep
when
i
drank
the
last
drop
aroma
is
fairly
hoppy
and
has
a
strong
fruity
overtone
it
pours
a
deep
coppery
reddish
brown
with
a
fairly
thick
offwhite
head
flavor
wooo
one
sip
of
this
beer
and
you
will
know
what
it
is
like
to
have
an
angry
puma
in
your
mouth
it
is
fierce
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
bitterness
is
strong
but
not
unpleasant
taste
is
mainly
hoppy
with
some
malty
and
sweet
tones
and
hints
of
cocacola
and
caramel
texture
is
satisfyingly
smooth
and
aftertaste
is
bitter
yet
with
a
sweet
fruity
undertone
like
no
other
beer
i
have
ever
tried
d
its
scary
how
easy
this
beer
is
to
drink
i
wanted
a
memorable
one
for
my
200th
review
and
this
beer
sure
did
the
trick
just
be
careful
with
this
cause
a
22
oz
bottle
will
do
the
job
if
your
looking
for
a
buzz
probably
a
good
beer
to
sip
and
enjoy
no
way
you
could
session
this
double
bastard
pours
a
dark
ruby
red
with
a
giant
offwhite
head
the
smell
is
fairly
pungent
from
hops
with
a
kick
of
centennial
citrus
followed
by
sweet
alcohol
maybe
a
bit
estery
the
taste
is
a
bit
bitter
bu
with
a
sweet
burnt
alcohol
taste
at
times
i
get
a
bit
of
bready
malts
its
fairly
complex
but
i
keep
tasting
the
burnt
taste
from
alcohol
which
might
disguise
some
more
pleasant
flavors
in
the
mouthfeel
this
beer
will
moreorless
kick
your
ass
but
without
leaving
a
black
eye
a
growler
isnt
a
good
idea
without
some
help
d
i
wouldnt
call
this
an
easy
drinker
by
any
means
here
is
the
deal
with
double
bastard
drink
it
fresh
to
get
that
big
hop
taste
or
lay
it
down
for
at
least
a
year
the
hops
fade
and
the
malt
totally
takes
over
you
often
forget
how
damn
hoppy
this
beer
is
fresh
overall
amazing
stuff
big
bold
and
full
of
flavour
highly
recommended
the
diatribe
on
this
beer
is
a
bit
much
but
stone
does
deliver
alcohol
is
everywhere
in
this
beer
very
strong
but
finishes
somewhat
sweet
beginners
should
start
with
the
arrogant
brew
and
work
their
way
up
my
liver
is
probably
the
only
one
happy
that
this
only
comes
out
around
thanksgiving
d
a
beast
of
a
beer
everytime
i
drink
one
of
these
it
becomes
kind
of
overwhelming
i
definitely
appreciate
what
they
are
going
for
here
but
i
just
dont
pine
for
it
d
not
a
very
drinkable
ale
but
you
knew
that
already
since
it
is
double
bastard
and
that
indicates
an
extreme
beer
strong
ale
in
the
truest
sense
the
taste
is
very
over
the
top
and
should
probably
always
split
this
unless
you
can
handle
super
ball
sized
wasabi
it
was
a
very
intense
beer
before
bedtime
and
i
think
this
works
best
with
a
hearty
meal
for
instance
shepherds
pie
drinkability
infinitely
ok
not
infinitely
but
very
much
so
better
than
the
fresh
version
this
is
definitely
a
beer
that
improves
vastly
with
age
the
hops
need
time
to
mellow
out
here
and
though
the
good
fruit
flavors
are
present
in
both
theyre
marred
by
tons
of
piney
spicy
bitterness
in
the
fresh
version
alcohols
large
and
in
both
of
them
whether
or
not
you
can
taste
itfeel
it
underneath
all
the
prickly
spicy
dominant
sweetness
and
bitterness
nonetheless
its
there
drinkability
while
this
is
definitely
an
excellent
brew
it
is
so
potent
that
im
going
to
be
hard
pressed
to
get
through
the
whole
bomber
also
it
doesnt
necessarily
hit
my
personal
tastes
as
its
a
little
too
sweet
for
me
but
once
again
stone
has
crafted
something
magnificent
lots
of
hops
to
cut
through
the
heavy
malt
feel
alcohol
is
notable
but
not
the
predominant
flavor
the
potency
can
be
sensed
without
dictating
the
taste
hops
are
the
story
here
its
very
much
like
a
dark
dipaperhaps
we
could
call
this
triple
ipa
does
this
style
get
better
than
this
i
think
it
is
hard
to
imagine
such
a
beer
d
im
giving
this
a
4
5
because
its
drinkability
relative
to
the
alcohol
level
and
overall
bigness
as
well
as
the
past
double

aroma
the
taste
is
intense
thick
hoppy
flavor
a
llittle
oily
and
citrusy
alcohol
is
fairly
obvious
without
being
obnoxious
this
is
a
good
slowdrinking
beer
for
a
cold
night
powerful
but
present
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
goblet
with
ba
buddies
moxley
and
pleepleus
the
beer
poured
a
reddish
brown
similar
to
iced
tea
made
from
powder
little
bit
of
off
white
head
not
much
in
the
way
of
lacing
big
strong
smell
with
very
faint
hints
of
fruity
sweet
apples
pears
and
apricot
big
time
flavors
comin
out
of
this
one
bitter
right
up
front
with
heavy
malty
alcohol
flavors
the
finish
was
even
more
intense
with
notes
of
caramel
as
it
warms
up
this
beer
coated
the
mouth
well
with
a
sticky
sweet
slightly
syrupy
mouthfeel
and
extreme
alcohol
warmth
as
big
as
the
alcohol
flavors
are
in
this
one
it
is
somehow
not
overpowering
a
definite
sipper
at
10
abv
the
beer
was
copper
with
some
plum
and
had
a
head
that
dissipated
quickly
the
nose
showed
sweet
caramal
plum
stewing
raisins
spice
and
orange
in
the
mouth
it
was
medium
to
fullbodied
with
good
malt
richness
with
balancing
hops
the
palate
was
not
as
dilineated
as
the
nose
and
showed
more
chocolate
and
coffee
than
the
nose
it
was
also
sweeter
as
the
malt
showed
stronger
this
should
age
well
but
is
great
now
if
in
the
mood
for
a
sweet
malty
beer
the
beer
is
exceptional
but
nothing
to
be
afraid
of
simply
respect
it
and
realize
that
it
can
get
to
you
quite
suddenly
pours
a
hazy
copper
color
with
12
inch
of
creamy
tan
head
good
retention
and
good
lacing
smells
of
citrus
like
oranges
pineapple
grapefruit
as
well
as
spices
caramel
brown
sugar
toffee
and
bread
taste
begins
with
a
little
spurt
of
grapefruit
and
pineapple
before
a
nice
sweetness
of
caramel
molasses
and
brown
sugar
come
into
play
finishes
with
a
nice
bittering
pine
and
alcohol
warmth
full
in
body
and
low
in
carbonation
strong
and
sweet
with
a
good
balance
and
bittering
characteristics
as
the
beer
warms
more
alcohol
presence
comes
out
in
a
variety
of
assaults
on
the
taste
buds
including
rum
brandy
and
scotch
good
stuff
but
its
very
intense
to
be
handled
with
care
though
american
strong
ale
is
somewhat
of
a
catchall
style
i
believe
double
bastard
sets
the
benchmark
quite
nicely
this
is
one
to
seek
out
drinkability
this
is
one
intense
beer
even
for
its
strength
i
think
i
prefer
the
original
bastard
because
the
flavors
seem
a
bit
more
in
focus
but
this
is
a
nice
complex
enjoyable
sipper
as
well
mfd
smooth
and
creamy
the
alcohol
really
warms
you
not
a
session
ale
final
thoughts
very
nice
although
i
much
prefer
stones
arrogant
bastard
to
the
double
bastard
the
alcohol
was
hidden
very
well
this
is
very
drinkable
for
a
10
i
could
drink
a
couple
of
bottles
of
this
d
this
one
is
certainly
an
assault
on
the
senses
i
couldnt
imagine
having
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
sitting
complex
but
also
inyourface
this
is
definitely
a
unique
stone
brew
drinkability
personally
i
would
not
get
this
one
again
will
keep
some
in
the
cooler
for
friends
who
like
the
style
and
quality
but
give
me
more
malt
pours
into
my
globe
glass
a
cloudy
brown
color
with
a
thin
light
brown
head
that
quickly
settles
to
a
thin
layer
of
foam
pleasing
piney
hop
aroma
and
sweet
fruit
notes
taste
wow
very
malty
almost
like
a
barleywine
just
a
bit
of
hoppyness
in
the
back
alcohol
is
surprisingly
well
hidden
initially
but
quickly
becomes
more
apparent
as
it
warms
mouthfeel
is
very
big
and
bold
but
smoooth
drinkability
is
amazing
but
also
dangerous
such
a
strong
ale
that
goes
down
this
easy
and
this
smoothly
is
likely
to
sneak
up
on
you
in
a
hurry
md
excellent
carbonation
and
increadibly
smooth
and
easy
the
10
merits
a
little
caution
wouldnt
be
a
bad
idea
to
have
somebody
to
split
the
bomber
with
home
alone
this
weekend
though
so
i
guess
i
will
have
to
finish
it
myself
poor
me
d
not
sure
if
i
could
handle
more
than
one
but
this
was
definitely
a
treat
for
my
first
time
on
the
palate
is
a
strong
malt
presence
that
is
syrupy
and
reminds
me
of
caramel
or
other
similar
chewy
candies
but
the
hops
and
alcohol
kick
in
to
balance
it
out
overall
it
is
a
big
chewy
savory
beer
that
is
surprisingly
easy
to
drink
d
this
is
a
big
beer
and
is
like
i
said
before
sweet
in
spite
of
its
bitterness
this
sweetness
is
unlike
anything
else
it
is
rich
and
heavy
and
demands
your
attention
great
beer
from
a
great
trader
and
i
am
happy
i
had
the
change
to
experience
something
that
is
not
distributed
to
my
area
d
this
is
a
great
late
nightafter
dinner
sipper
i
will
have
no
problem
finishing
the
bomber
worthy
or
not
i
do
plan
to
drink
this
beer
again
whenever
i
can
find
it
one
of
the
worlds
great
beers
definitely
worth
seeking
out
even
for
those
of
us
who
are
not
the
biggest
fans
of
a
b
classic
this
beer
is
intense
it
almost
knocked
me
to
my
feet
pours
a
very
dark
brownish
orange
color
a
true
dark
amber
color
the
smell
is
subdued
giving
only
a
slight
idea
of
what
is
to
come
the
first
sip
is
glorious
strong
very
strong
but
sweet
at
the
same
time
not
as
bitter
as
you
would
think
a
10beer
would
be
this
stuff
is
dangerous
it
is
insanely
drinkable
for
the
alcohol
content
i
am
definitely
grabbing
some
of
this
again
i
tried
this
right
after
the
oaked
bastard
and
it
poured
pretty
much
the
same
it
smelled
quite
different
though
more
like
a
barleywine
with
prunes
and
roasted
malt
scents
mixing
with
citrus
hops
and
some
alcohol
smells
it
tasted
very
strong
like
orange
hops
cherries
and
brown
sugar
with
some
alcohol
warming
it
was
oily
with
almost
no
carbonation
and
had
an
ultra
smooth
and
long
lasting
aftertaste
that
was
both
very
bitter
and
nicely
sweet
overall
this
was
a
very
complex
very
strong
and
very
delicious
beer
more
please
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
wellcarbonated
the
booziness
gets
to
be
intrusive
with
some
warmth
and
the
drinkability
takes
a
dip
for
this
killer
beer
overall
though
big
thanks
to
miguelmandingo
on
ba
for
sharing
this
bottle
wasnt
expecting
too
much
from
this
as
i
wasnt
a
terribly
big
fan
of
the
arrogant
bastard
but
was
very
pleasantly
surprised
pours
a
dark
maroon
color
a
bit
murky
and
a
nice
beige
head
atop
taste
is
rich
sweet
maltiness
in
the
form
of
dark
toasty
caramel
and
nicely
and
appropriately
hopped
smooth
with
no
rough
edges
yet
crisp
and
with
a
nice
mild
bitterness
creamy
caramelly
hopped
flavor
and
much
superior
to
arrogant
bastard
i
thought
thanks
again
mike
poured
a
very
dark
with
light
head
it
smelled
very
strongly
of
hops
it
felt
slightly
bitter
with
minimal
bubbles
in
his
mouth
and
tasted
very
hoppy
yet
smooth
it
wasnt
quite
as
amazingly
smooth
as
the
regular
arrogant
bastard
but
it
was
close
still
remained
pretty
drinkable
despite
how
heavy
and
high
in
alcohol
it
was
good
but
still
liked
the
original
bastard
the
best
hv
the
more
sips
i
take
the
less
i
notice
the
alcohol
and
now
im
able
to
really
start
focusing
on
the
flavours
and
man
its
so
tasty
and
so
well
balanced
that
i
dont
want
the
bottles
contents
to
leave
very
nice
sipping
strong
ale
and
with
its
creamy
smooth
mouthfeel
and
nicely
done
light
carbonation
this
is
certainly
a
great
brew
worthy
of
its
reputation
highly
recommended
d
nice
brew
but
very
stong
on
all
of
the
senses
d
this
is
a
very
substantial
sipping
beer
solid
hop
and
malt
balance
with
a
warm
and
clean
finish
overall
this
beer
stradles
the
line
between
an
old
ale
and
barley
wine
though
it
has
that
citrusy
hop
essence
that
defines
it
as
an
allamerican
version
of
either
very
nice
beer
recommended
a
sipper
and
a
bomber
worthy
of
sharing
i
think
i
may
prefer
the
regular
arrogant
bastard
because
its
less
brash
maybe
im
just
not
worthy
comes
off
as
an
american
barleywine
in
my
book
but
who
cares
for
style
guidelines
man
this
is
a
good
wellbalanced
beer
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
and
a
bit
on
the
syrupysticky
side
and
the
drinkability
is
low
due
to
the
big
alcohol
presence
and
off
metallic
flavor
d
pretty
sweet
ale
another
solid
drinking
choice
received
from
d0ggnate
in
a
trade
thanks
pours
surprsingly
red
and
cloudy
its
a
dark
reddish
orange
quite
hazy
and
almost
syrupy
in
pour
consistency
out
of
the
bottle
there
is
little
head
but
what
is
there
settles
to
a
ring
big
spicy
malty
aromas
up
front
followed
by
some
nice
orangey
citrus
and
piney
hops
this
beer
has
a
quite
interesting
malty
flavor
profile
up
front
almost
as
if
there
were
toasted
rice
and
barley
in
it
this
is
followed
by
a
fruity
sweetness
that
is
furthr
followed
by
a
long
bitter
citrus
flavor
and
a
nice
oily
piney
hop
finish
mouthfeel
is
pure
and
clean
but
big
and
with
a
touch
of
sweetness
this
isnt
sticky
or
cloying
at
all
and
is
quite
balanced
by
the
toasted
flavors
and
the
hops
surprisingly
drinkable
not
as
harsh
and
more
integrated
than
many
stone
brews
im
not
always
a
fan
of
all
of
their
brews
but
this
one
deserves
its
accolades
huge
interesting
nicely
hoppy
balanced
and
generally
well
done
clean
on
the
lips
but
heavy
on
the
throat
this
brew
needs
more
bubbles
the
saving
grace
here
is
a
total
lack
of
bitters
for
its
gravity
and
hop
profile
this
is
quite
drinkable
too
drinkable
i
love
it
great
stuff
definitely
recommended
a
pleasure
thanks
to
the
papago
b
c
in
phoenix
for
putting
this
one
on
the
lines
md
full
bodied
medium
carbonation
smooth
on
the
palate
drinkability
only
hindered
by
10
but
still
very
easy
to
down
d
strong
indeed
i
shared
the
bottle
not
sure
my
mouth
could
handle
a
whole
bomber
alone
d
very
drinkable
for
such
a
high
abv
the
tingle
is
pleasant
rather
than
offputting
and
the
delicious
flavor
demands
to
be
sipped
on
over
and
over
again
this
is
an
absolutely
wonderful
beer
that
is
worth
every
penny
of
its
somewhat
expensive
price
point
drinkability
more
than
you
probably
should
lets
put
it
this
way
about
78
years
ago
we
watched
a
martha
stewart
show
on
the
food
network
where
shes
making
her
signature
egg
nog
for
new
years
the
recipe
looked
awesome
and
at
the
end
of
the
show
she
pours
a
mugful
and
with
this
pseudosatanic
grin
she
stares
into
the
camera
and
says
remember
one
glass
per
person
of
course
we
made
a
batch
which
turned
out
better
than
expected
ignored
her
admonishment
and
wound
up
pretty
well
faced
dont
let
this
happen
to
you
enjoy
this
stuff
in
moderation
yet
again
ive
come
across
a
glorious
great
beer
that
will
make
frequent
appearances
in
my
refrigerator
truly
outstanding
double
bastard
ranks
right
there
with
brown
shugga
as
my
favorite
strong
ales
mouth
feel
is
filling
slight
warming
but
not
what
could
be
expected
from
a
lesser
brew
i
wanted
another
of
these
but
at
10
abv
i
didnt
want
to
fill
up
all
in
all
a
really
good
brew
that
i
will
revisit
soon
2006
bottle
on
1028
this
is
not
the
same
beer
aged
at
all
where
did
the
hops
go
with
age
this
beer
becomes
way
too
sweet
and
heavy
this
is
a
reminder
to
myself
buy
this
every
winter
and
drink
up
yes
at
10
alcohol
you
can
age
but
why
much
much
better
fresh
imho
i
dunno
i
just
like
this
you
know
i
mean
really
and
i
think
that
im
not
just
being
subjective
it
looks
very
nice
it
smells
so
nice
sweet
and
bitter
it
tastes
well
its
sweet
and
its
bitter
a
fair
amount
of
each
i
imagine
but
very
well
balanced
if
this
were
available
all
year
well
id
drink
it
all
year
d
i
definitely
love
this
beer
and
could
drink
a
keg
of
it
if
i
could
but
considering
the
close
to
10
abv
i
doubt
i
could
i
cant
get
this
in
tn
yet
but
im
making
a
trip
to
ky
in
a
day
or
two
and
i
know
for
a
fact
that
they
have
cases
stacked
up
of
this
i
may
blow
my
whole
wad
on
this
beer
incredible
whats
amazing
is
how
mature
the
2007
batch
already
seems
normally
i
enjoy
this
aged
about
a
year
but
its
already
fantastic
i
need
to
pick
up
more
of
this
and
if
you
can
find
it
you
should
too
i
would
just
enjoy
it
fresh
but
im
sure
the
new
batch
will
age
well
too
d
not
bad
i
guess
smell
is
great
but
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
are
a
bit
lacking
the
alcohol
is
too
noticeable
and
the
taste
is
not
as
complex
or
intriguing
as
i
expected
a
fantastic
dipa
i
would
suggest
it
to
anyone
who
is
a
fan
of
the
style
this
beauty
pours
a
huge
thick
head
with
large
lacing
on
the
glass
the
nose
as
big
aroma
of
caramel
and
brandy
like
qualities
the
high
alcohol
level
warms
the
mouththen
the
syrupy
malt
wave
controls
the
heat
until
the
blast
of
piney
hops
counter
attacks
the
big
burnt
sugarcongnac
flavor
all
this
fades
into
a
sweet
citrus
finish
pretty
amazing
where
i
found
this
beer
in
a
small
quicky
mart
like
store
next
to
venice
beach
gotta
love
california
d
at
10
and
a
bomber
at
that
im
not
having
more
than
one
of
these
tonight
but
certainly
something
i
would
revisit
given
the
opportunity
despite
being
a
huge
beer
this
is
still
well
balanced
and
isnt
at
all
a
chore
to
finish
thanks
to
tayner
and
cburian
for
the
hookup
the
longer
i
drink
it
the
more
i
like
it
but
given
its
character
of
overall
strength
in
every
category
it
lacks
some
drinkable
appeal
what
a
wonderful
smelling
beer
deep
mahogany
with
plenty
of
lacing
smells
of
plums
and
hops
plenty
of
alcohol
here
that
burns
the
nostrils
a
bit
when
you
really
try
to
dig
into
it
taste
is
big
hops
everywhere
earthy
tart
apples
spicy
hot
alcohol
is
in
your
face
they
couldnt
have
picked
a
better
name
this
beer
begs
for
aging
if
i
ever
come
across
this
again
it
is
going
straight
to
the
cellar
let
this
one
warm
up
it
is
a
completely
different
beer
at
room
temp
this
beer
poured
a
cloudy
brownishorange
with
very
little
head
the
aroma
is
deep
with
malty
caramel
and
alcoholic
characteristics
quite
apparent
the
taste
is
bold
and
has
a
punch
but
at
the
same
time
it
is
has
a
nice
balance
of
malt
and
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
but
not
chewy
alcohol
is
noticeable
but
seems
appropriate
overall
this
is
an
impressive
beer
that
should
only
be
ventured
into
by
the
worthy
this
is
a
full
bodied
dank
beer
that
is
surpisingly
very
drinkable
may
i
have
another
d
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
so
far
this
becomes
a
relaxing
drink
after
the
initial
excitement
maybe
it
is
the
little
hop
high
maybe
it
is
the
11
a
few
pints
of
this
can
disappear
rather
quickly
watch
out
d
the
double
bastard
is
a
scarily
drinkable
beer
that
packs
quite
a
bunch
very
tasty
and
a
great
job
by
stone
let
me
say
that
i
love
double
bastard
i
want
this
beer
to
comfort
me
on
my
deathbed
enjoy
prosit
mk
this
is
an
ipa
taken
to
new
extremes
bottle
2007
wonderful
draught
even
better
just
make
sure
they
dont
overchill
the
beer
because
while
it
tastes
good
american
cold
temperature
it
tastes
awesome
at
just
below
room
temp
the
flavors
come
roaring
get
some
now
its
been
3
years
since
my
review
and
while
i
havent
drunk
as
much
of
this
beer
as
i
thought
i
would
i
still
remain
very
impressed
with
it
im
taking
my
scores
down
to
better
reflect
the
changes
in
my
palate
however
the
succulent
juicy
blend
of
hops
with
pine
pineapple
and
grapefruit
with
dark
caramel
a
little
cocoa
and
a
mild
sweetness
the
flavors
on
the
palate
are
the
same
as
the
nose
would
suggest
and
while
this
is
boozy
this
never
gets
overbearing
the
alcohol
does
hinder
the
drinkability
but
split
two
ways
this
is
perfect
edit
wooh
i
only
wanted
1
beer
before
bed
this
is
the
perfect
nightcap
it
definitely
seems
a
bit
harsh
when
fresh
and
im
sure
aging
would
help
in
that
regard
but
the
already
weak
hops
comparatively
would
surely
dissipate
more
so
its
a
bit
of
a
catch22
still
its
a
very
nice
beer
and
ill
be
buying
at
least
1
bomber
each
year
very
complex
yet
well
balanced
delicate
yet
delicious
another
fine
brew
from
stone
and
possible
the
best
vintage
yet
i
was
skeptical
about
the
hype
but
this
beer
is
definitely
worth
it
i
cant
wait
to
buy
another
bought
this
to
my
recent
trip
back
home
to
jackson
michigan
i
couldnt
save
it
but
shared
it
with
bwatson
it
poured
a
murky
amber
into
a
chalice
kind
of
looks
like
the
kansas
river
on
a
summer
day
almost
no
head
in
my
chalice
but
bwatson
got
a
little
head
off
of
his
pour
the
smell
is
a
trip
in
itself
at
first
you
just
smell
hops
raisins
but
then
later
on
the
sweet
pineapple
and
piney
smells
come
through
its
awesome
the
taste
is
exceptional
caramel
pineapple
hops
its
a
ride
this
one
goes
down
extremely
well
despite
its
high
abv
i
would
gladly
buy
another
bottle
of
this
one
d
this
is
definitely
a
sipper
but
for
how
much
it
lets
the
alcohol
through
i
am
surprised
i
am
able
to
drink
so
much
bomber
into
a
huge
handled
glass
clear
deep
red
copper
with
a
huge
persistant
offwhite
head
leaves
a
nice
lacing
on
the
surface
aroma
is
mostly
nice
citrus
hops
with
a
definite
underlying
sweetness
taste
is
quite
sweet
with
some
caramel
some
earthiness
and
hints
of
raisins
and
plums
noticeable
alcohol
in
the
finish
lots
of
citrus
hops
balance
the
sweetness
well
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
delicious
full
bodied
mouthfeel
and
not
overly
carbonated
which
i
think
suits
this
beer
perfectly
the
noticable
achohol
and
10
abv
detract
from
drinkability
somewhat
but
its
awesome
stuff
that
i
could
hardly
refuse
another
glass
of
22
oz
bomber
2007
release
purchased
at
wine
gallery
in
brookline
ma
a
pours
a
nice
amberred
some
an
head
that
retains
to
a
caked
on
layer
good
amount
of
lacing
s
lots
of
caramel
malts
alcohol
is
present
but
not
overwhelming
the
hops
have
a
pretty
strong
presence
it
almost
smells
like
a
dipa
t
really
nice
malt
profile
the
hops
are
very
present
but
nothing
like
the
smell
would
indicate
alcohol
is
actually
pretty
well
hidden
wonderfully
dry
finish
d
i
love
the
arrogant
bastard
ale
ive
had
it
on
plenty
of
occasions
so
i
was
very
eager
to
try
this
beer
for
something
with
so
much
alcohol
its
incredibly
smooth
and
drinkable
ill
definitely
be
picking
this
up
again
nice
amber
in
color
with
little
head
that
leaves
a
lacy
coast
over
the
brew
the
first
taste
kicks
your
ass
off
very
strong
beer
with
mault
being
the
strongest
i
read
the
back
of
the
bottle
and
i
thought
it
was
a
joke
probably
the
strongest
ale
i
have
ever
had
overall
not
bad
but
a
little
too
strong
for
my
taste
i
guess
off
notes
1132006
pours
ruby
colored
with
thick
lacing
minimal
nose
slightly
citric
very
hoppy
as
expected
but
with
a
slight
tangy
edge
almost
sweet
over
time
that
flavor
smoothes
out
and
the
sweeter
side
comes
out
but
stays
consistent
and
smooth
feel
is
smooth
with
a
great
amount
of
carbonation
on
the
mouth
very
drinkable
until
you
start
to
realize
that
10
is
kicking
in
hard
i
liked
this
better
than
last
time
i
had
it
but
its
still
too
much
to
drink
a
lot
of
it
pours
a
beautiful
mahogany
color
with
a
nice
off
white
head
there
is
an
intense
bitterness
right
up
front
with
a
ton
of
hop
flavor
that
fades
into
a
big
sweet
malt
profile
this
is
just
like
a
regular
beer
only
with
a
thousand
times
more
everything
a
pretty
good
beer
although
i
couldnt
drink
much
more
than
the
10oz
i
had
not
impressed
with
this
beer
just
too
hot
and
big
didnt
seem
at
all
under
control
at
all
just
big
for
the
sake
of
being
big
lol
although
the
carbonation
is
lower
than
i
usually
like
but
it
feels
more
gentle
than
flat
this
adds
to
the
drinkability
which
could
be
considered
a
benefit
or
danger
this
ale
has
a
nice
mouthfeel
with
just
enough
sweetness
to
balance
out
the
robust
mature
base
which
has
plenty
of
bitternessi
like
that
i
am
not
a
fan
of
sweet
beers
and
this
is
not
a
sweet
beer
but
its
sweetness
is
a
lovely
peripheral
aspect
that
doesnt
fade
into
the
rest
of
the
beer
nor
is
it
overwhelming
its
just
one
of
the
many
characteristics
of
this
interesting
complex
beer
a
true
winner
and
a
great
example
of
stones
propensity
to
brew
outstanding
big
beers
tastes
thick
justthick
theres
some
very
large
hops
and
some
very
thick
caramely
syrup
malt
thatwell
let
me
put
it
this
way
when
i
was
working
at
a
gas
station
in
high
school
we
had
to
change
the
fountain
pop
syrup
one
time
the
bag
of
mountain
dew
syrup
had
ruptured
before
we
opened
the
box
that
contained
it
blackgreen
goo
dripped
out
its
side
and
it
smelled
like
the
most
refreshingly
synthetic
mountain
dewiness
you
could
ever
imagine
so
strong
that
we
were
tempting
to
lick
it
but
we
stopped
ourselves
knowing
that
after
tasting
it
regular
mountain
dew
would
no
longer
we
worth
our
time
thats
what
this
is
like
surely
something
to
savor
and
enjoy
tastes
of
bitter
spicy
hops
caramel
alcohol
and
pine
very
nice
mouthfeel
and
rather
drinkable
for
such
a
ferocious
beer
ruby
brown
in
appearance
aromas
of
boozy
cherries
citrus
and
carmel
malt
tastes
of
sweet
malts
lots
of
carmel
and
dark
fruits
finishes
with
a
nice
bitter
grapefruit
rind
flavor
alcohol
presence
is
well
known
but
not
harsh
mouth
feel
is
heavy
syrupy
and
sticky
very
coating
low
carbonation
a
bit
more
would
have
been
nice
overall
drinkability
is
great
for
the
cold
weather
this
brew
is
bold
and
boozy
to
make
it
a
slow
sipper
i
will
be
seeking
this
one
out
again
for
sure
highly
recommended
poured
a
22
oz
into
a
pint
glass
hue
was
dark
amber
with
a
slight
head
tan
in
color
the
ales
malt
held
up
nicely
to
what
could
have
been
overpowering
hops
finished
bitter
the
diatribe
on
the
back
of
the
bottle
made
for
an
entertaining
read
during
the
imbibing
would
drink
this
one
again
have
yet
to
meet
a
stone
brew
i
didnt
like
double
bastard
is
quite
the
intense
flavor
experience
the
hops
are
piney
resinous
and
oh
so
potent
grapefruit
and
other
citrus
notes
balance
well
with
a
ton
of
earthy
sweet
hawaiian
bread
malts
mouthfeel
is
impeccable
thick
viscous
body
stickysweet
with
a
longlasting
bitter
hop
finish
drinkability
of
this
beer
is
quite
high
in
the
face
of
its
whopping
10
abv
the
complexity
and
flavor
are
almost
like
that
of
a
iipa
but
this
bastard
packs
enough
malt
to
satiate
the
most
finickey
of
great
beerseekers
this
beers
aromas
hit
me
as
i
was
pouring
it
into
a
glass
sweet
and
sticky
malt
with
piney
hops
and
alcohol
the
hops
stand
out
as
they
should
the
appearance
is
dark
amber
with
a
sticky
and
substantial
head
some
fine
sediment
toward
the
end
of
the
bottle
the
first
taste
is
surprisingly
smooth
and
almost
mellow
for
such
a
big
beer
as
the
beer
warms
it
becomes
more
robust
but
remains
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
my
kind
of
beer
as
its
sweet
sticky
and
highly
dryhopped
the
aroma
plays
a
big
role
with
each
sip
bringing
with
it
the
warming
effect
of
the
alcohol
and
all
the
herbal
oils
of
the
piney
hops
if
this
beer
wasnt
built
on
a
sticky
sweet
base
of
malt
it
would
be
so
out
of
balance
great
job
stone
on
the
beer
and
the
packaging
overall
a
wicked
strong
ale
but
as
the
bottle
says
only
for
those
not
faint
of
heart
i
might
need
to
go
to
bed
after
this
and
sleep
it
off
pours
amber
and
copper
very
slight
haze
decent
head
the
nose
is
of
raisin
and
citrusy
hops
taste
is
suprisingly
smooth
very
creamy
with
some
vague
dark
fruit
flavors
and
some
malt
taste
hop
flavors
could
be
stronger
but
are
still
present
the
finish
has
just
a
pinch
of
bitterness
but
is
refreshingly
creamy
the
mouthfeel
is
good
and
hangs
on
aftertaste
is
mostly
hops
but
not
really
bitter
good
brew
i
like
it
better
than
the
original
i
know
thats
wierd
but
i
write
what
i
feel
get
it
for
sure
and
try
one
and
pop
one
in
the
cellar
should
age
quite
nicely
excellent
strong
ale
will
definitely
buy
more
overall
a
true
beer
masterpiece
of
american
craft
brewing
to
all
of
you
who
say
stone
is
overrated
i
have
for
you
evidence
2xaba
the
beer
pours
viscous
and
syrupy
into
the
pint
glass
and
raises
a
substantial
head
of
offwhite
foam
the
lacing
begins
immediately
and
lingers
sticky
white
this
time
the
first
smell
that
i
can
recognize
is
of
canned
pineapple
very
pronounced
the
taste
is
retains
some
of
the
pineapple
but
draws
on
sugar
candy
strong
malt
maybe
a
little
toffee
the
high
alcohol
is
incredibly
well
hiddenbalanced
by
all
that
is
going
on
both
in
a
velvety
thick
mouthfeel
and
a
nice
warm
bitterness
at
the
end
this
beer
is
wonderful
especially
by
the
fire
on
a
dark
cold
winter
evening
great
beer
md
ok
i
have
to
knock
these
a
bit
its
def
not
a
sipper
nor
is
it
a
beer
to
session
it
is
however
a
very
good
beer
one
you
can
sit
back
and
enjoy
a
bomber
of
with
no
problem
but
with
strong
enough
effect
and
after
taste
you
may
not
want
more
than
that
in
one
sitting
it
is
by
no
way
bad
just
not
easily
largely
consumable
if
that
even
makes
sense
to
me
it
does
this
beer
isnt
lacking
in
any
department
as
everything
seems
to
hit
hard
and
fast
in
both
aroma
and
flavor
but
im
not
so
sure
everything
works
together
all
at
once
i
definitely
think
this
beer
is
complex
and
it
requires
some
serious
contemplation
and
its
most
definitely
a
sippin
beer
take
your
time
with
this
one
and
savor
every
moment
you
may
not
like
every
detail
but
you
should
be
able
to
appreciate
the
layers
drinkability
i
dont
think
this
beer
is
intended
to
be
a
session
beer
22
oz
is
plenty
for
my
session
but
this
is
a
good
solid
extreme
beer
from
stone
i
prefer
arrogant
bastard
but
this
is
still
good
i
wish
that
i
had
the
self
control
to
hang
on
to
one
of
these
for
a
couple
of
years
to
let
it
age
it
would
probably
mellow
out
over
time
i
loved
this
and
would
spend
the
again
in
a
hearbeat
to
drink
more
wish
this
was
around
all
year
but
am
glad
that
it
just
came
out
and
more
can
be
had
d
this
was
my
4th
offering
at
12121212
i
would
gladly
have
tried
any
of
the
four
again
i
was
especially
fond
of
the
smoothness
that
this
beer
picked
up
if
youve
got
a
db
from
05
let
it
sit
a
bit
longer
and
really
enjoy
it
drinkability
this
is
probably
the
lowest
review
that
i
have
given
such
a
highly
rated
beer
i
was
disappointed
by
the
one
dimensional
taste
and
the
high
abv
makes
it
hard
to
enjoy
too
much
stick
with
the
arrogant
bastard
ale
this
is
not
an
improvement
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
i
want
to
give
this
one
another
shot
at
which
point
ill
edit
this
review
overall
i
thought
it
was
quite
good
and
worth
the
wait
but
i
want
to
make
sure
that
anticipation
is
not
skewing
my
perception
pours
a
dark
ruby
color
mostly
translucent
with
a
full
inch
of
light
brown
head
unlike
aromas
from
ab
this
one
gives
off
much
more
malty
notes
fruity
caramel
estery
plums
and
raisins
only
in
the
back
are
resiny
hops
evident
and
even
then
the
candy
maltiness
reigns
on
the
palate
it
becomes
more
evident
that
this
should
fall
into
the
double
ipa
catagory
as
the
hops
in
their
freshness
balance
quite
well
with
the
syrupy
malts
finishes
pretty
sweet
with
crystal
malts
mixing
well
with
darker
perhaps
chocolate
malts
it
really
just
is
a
supremely
balanced
beer
for
how
big
it
is
i
wouldnt
put
any
age
on
this
one
its
like
a
fresh
bigfoot
how
enjoyable
this
beer
is
im
glad
to
finally
try
it
notes
this
was
a
fresh
bottle
ive
done
a
3
year
vertical
tasting
in
the
past
and
seem
to
recall
that
the
double
bastard
ages
well
ive
got
a
2004
in
my
cellar
and
now
a
couple
more
of
the
2007
bottles
so
ill
report
back
some
day
on
how
the
db
does
after
various
amounts
of
time
spent
in
the
cellar
mouthfeel
is
medium
maybe
medium
heavy
some
good
carbonation
lightening
up
the
body
and
making
it
drinkable
i
guess
this
beer
is
kind
of
like
an
american
barleywine
but
lighter
in
character
thereby
more
drinkable
i
like
it
but
a
22
oz
bomber
by
oneself
is
a
bit
much
a
bit
repetitive
and
a
bit
expensive
probably
wont
return
to
this
there
are
other
beers
that
i
like
more
and
cost
less
yum
d
big
bold
flavorful
but
a
sipper
that
i
couldnt
finish
in
one
sitting
hops
are
intense
sweet
malts
even
moreso
after
a
halfbottle
the
flavors
become
oppressive
on
the
tongue
still
awfully
good
a
must
try
for
the
big
beer
enthusiast
the
beer
is
very
warming
and
while
impressive
is
just
not
all
that
enjoyable
in
the
same
style
i
much
prefer
the
bigfoot
where
the
sweet
malt
has
been
dialed
down
a
tad
a
good
beer
but
not
what
i
would
call
terrific
cool
bomber
poured
into
pint
glass
appearance
is
a
reddish
amber
which
completely
threw
off
my
expectations
of
the
beer
as
a
double
ipa
smell
is
extremely
floral
liquid
hops
taste
is
impressively
smooth
despite
the
immense
complexity
of
the
hops
which
pair
nicely
with
the
sweet
malty
base
its
certainly
a
big
beer
overall
a
totally
different
beer
than
what
ive
had
in
the
bottle
if
the
bomber
i
have
in
the
fridge
at
home
is
significantly
different
ill
post
another
review
of
it
edit
i
cellared
several
of
these
and
have
just
had
it
at
one
year
the
hops
floral
flavors
have
definitely
faded
but
the
bitterness
is
still
there
the
malt
has
become
creamier
and
i
think
i
prefer
it
with
a
year
on
it
otherwise
just
about
all
of
my
notes
from
last
years
fresh
bottle
still
apply
cant
wait
to
see
how
it
is
at
2
years
drinkability
had
this
beer
on
tap
very
good
bew
should
come
out
more
often
instead
of
winter
go
get
as
much
as
you
can
you
cant
go
wrong
you
cant
drink
it
all
night
but
for
the
time
the
bottle
lasts
its
heaven
or
hell
in
a
glass
double
bastard
is
everything
arrogant
bastard
wishes
it
could
be
this
is
the
very
first
time
ive
tried
this
ale
and
it
definitely
lives
up
to
its
infamous
lore
man
this
babys
got
some
moxy
and
gumption
this
is
no
lie
very
full
tilt
and
in
a
strange
way
very
balanced
and
somewhat
graceful
this
ale
sure
dishes
out
some
tuff
love
sit
down
mind
your
manners
look
me
in
the
eye
when
im
talking
to
you
and
raise
your
hand
when
you
have
a
question
thank
you
sir
may
i
have
another
ouch
excellent
beer
if
you
have
one
you
like
to
gamble
and
it
will
pay
off
silky
mouthfeel
that
seems
to
dance
on
the
tongue
chewy
i
love
this
beer
and
find
it
an
excellent
winter
companion
warming
yet
refreshing
aggressively
beautiful
highly
recommended
i
will
call
it
a
kick
ass
beer
stone
keep
brewing
your
awesome
beers
d
a
delicious
beer
but
drinkability
is
not
high
a
10
brew
in
a
22
oz
bomber
certainly
packs
a
punch
overall
however
highly
recommended
d
a
very
good
beer
especially
if
you
like
lots
of
hops
and
tend
toward
the
higher
gravity
brews
as
i
do
if
not
this
will
probably
be
too
bitter
for
you
dark
amber
brown
with
a
smallish
head
that
dissipates
to
a
layer
of
fine
bubbled
foam
smells
malty
and
sweet
with
some
hint
of
pine
massive
taste
with
tons
of
malty
caramel
sweetness
and
hoppy
undertones
a
very
pleasant
finish
feels
thick
and
viscous
in
the
mouth
with
enough
carbonation
to
create
a
great
feel
i
can
see
why
this
is
such
a
highly
rated
beer
it
deserves
all
the
accolades
it
receives
recommended
obviously
not
everyone
can
try
this
one
aged
for
5
years
but
i
highly
recommend
sticking
a
bottle
away
for
about
2
years
you
will
be
rewarded
with
a
beer
that
goes
from
an
interesting
strong
but
not
that
great
beer
to
a
strong
but
balanced
integrated
and
mellow
strong
ale
that
deserves
the
rating
it
gets
this
is
one
beer
ive
had
enough
of
to
feel
confident
in
saying
that
prost
this
beer
pours
a
deep
dark
mahogany
brown
with
rusted
red
accents
into
my
chalice
it
has
a
thin
tan
head
that
quickly
disappeared
with
little
to
no
lacing
to
speak
of
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
dominated
by
sweet
malt
and
dark
fruits
coming
through
the
scent
of
alcohol
and
pineapple
is
present
as
well
about
midchalice
sugary
malt
pine
dark
fruit
and
a
touch
of
citrus
run
across
my
palate
there
is
a
great
deal
going
on
with
this
beer
rich
malted
tones
and
a
smoky
caramel
are
the
most
dominant
flavors
to
me
in
this
beer
i
served
this
beer
at
cellar
temp
and
still
somehow
this
beer
tends
to
gain
more
life
the
warmer
it
gets
the
sweetness
of
the
malt
and
bitterness
of
the
hops
is
very
well
balanced
and
well
made
the
taste
is
in
your
face
the
whole
time
and
in
no
way
subtle
but
the
balance
is
really
a
nice
surprise
this
beer
is
a
very
nice
sipper
and
coats
the
mouth
and
tongue
very
well
with
its
stickiness
after
finishing
the
bomber
i
dont
really
want
another
one
right
now
and
i
wouldnt
drink
this
beer
with
a
meal
most
likely
it
is
very
heavy
and
quite
filling
i
know
the
american
strong
ale
category
is
a
bit
of
made
up
category
to
fill
a
large
variety
of
beers
that
craft
brewers
are
making
but
the
flavors
on
this
beer
actually
reminded
me
of
a
good
barleywine
all
in
all
great
offering
d
drinkability
gets
an
above
average
score
from
me
the
taste
is
average
but
this
brew
screams
american
strong
ale
in
almost
every
category
its
slightly
more
enjoyable
than
regular
ab
but
is
nowhere
near
oaked
ab
which
seems
to
take
everything
arrogant
about
the
ab
lineup
and
make
it
more
smooth
and
mature
i
enjoy
reading
the
longwinded
arrogant
description
on
the
back
of
these
bottles
but
this
honestly
does
not
stand
out
to
me
as
a
superior
asa
im
glad
i
was
able
to
sample
this
bottlebut
my
choice
from
the
ab
lineup
is
still
oaked
ab
eric
mouthfeeldrinkability
its
medium
bodied
carbonation
is
excellent
at
10
its
strong
but
perfect
for
this
beer
extremely
smooth
for
a
big
beer
i
could
probably
drink
this
all
night
if
i
wouldnt
pass
out
very
aggressive
and
big
in
character
another
stone
classic
the
mouthfeel
is
not
easy
on
the
palate
but
attacks
it
with
ample
carbonation
and
strong
hop
bitterness
this
one
is
all
that
you
would
expect
from
the
name
and
label
a
friend
of
mine
from
europe
visited
this
site
recently
and
commented
that
he
felt
that
a
lot
of
folks
seemed
to
give
high
marks
for
a
beer
based
mainly
on
the
machismo
factor
a
high
abv
content
after
reading
the
reviews
of
this
beer
and
then
tasting
it
thats
the
first
thought
that
came
to
my
mind
i
will
revisit
this
beer
again
for
another
try
not
because
i
wanted
more
but
because
perhaps
i
had
a
bad
bottle
im
definitely
in
the
minority
here
but
this
beer
was
quite
a
letdown
from
what
i
was
expecting
d
a
beautiful
strong
ale
sipper
makes
you
want
more
and
really
feels
great
in
the
mouth
overall
an
impressively
strong
and
tasty
brew
that
has
earned
quite
a
bit
of
my
respect
for
the
stone
brewing
company
definitely
worth
it
poured
this
from
a
bomber
into
a
pint
glass
beautiful
ruby
red
color
though
appeared
amber
at
the
top
no
head
or
lacing
that
i
could
notice
smell
was
nice
but
not
nearly
as
potent
as
it
tasted
lots
of
citrus
and
piney
notes
very
sweet
the
taste
was
an
explosion
of
flavors
all
of
them
wonderful
citrus
caramel
burnt
sugar
with
lots
of
hops
both
bitter
and
sweet
at
the
same
time
absolutely
amazing
and
even
better
when
it
warmed
up
a
bit
which
was
easy
to
do
because
of
the
sheer
volume
and
heavyness
of
the
thing
a
very
heavy
drink
in
alcohol
content
mouthfeel
and
flavor
i
dont
recommend
having
this
with
thanksgiving
dinner
or
any
other
heavy
meal
because
it
is
so
filling
however
on
its
own
it
is
an
amazing
drink
that
i
will
look
forward
to
each
year
well
worth
the
price
this
is
an
amazing
beer
from
the
2007
batch
and
poured
into
chalice
glass
one
thing
that
suprised
me
maybe
it
was
the
pour
was
there
was
little
to
no
head
but
a
beautiful
mahogeny
brown
and
violet
color
a
thin
offwhite
layer
that
lasted
shortly
and
no
lacing
could
have
been
my
fault
smell
is
very
citric
the
one
that
stood
out
to
me
was
pineapple
like
a
hint
of
caramel
a
small
touch
of
alcohol
as
well
taste
is
incredible
wonderfully
complex
touches
of
hops
malt
toasted
grain
alcohol
and
chocolate
a
warm
feeling
is
left
behind
and
the
first
sip
will
warm
your
chest
in
an
instance
low
carbonation
and
a
slightly
thick
mouthfeel
and
a
somewhat
oily
feeling
in
the
mouth
is
left
behind
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
and
worthy
of
all
of
its
praises
only
a
4
on
drinkability
as
i
want
to
have
another
but
a
bomber
of
this
is
enough
to
start
this
off
well
its
the
best
beer
ive
ever
had
when
you
pour
it
into
a
glass
its
a
dark
and
deep
shade
of
red
and
has
a
thick
tan
head
almost
like
a
stout
the
smell
isnt
very
overwhelming
more
misleading
than
anything
because
its
not
near
as
strong
as
the
taste
the
taste
is
very
sweet
and
hoppy
you
have
some
fruit
mixed
in
there
and
again
pretty
damn
hoppy
the
alcohol
is
mixed
very
well
with
the
taste
it
doesnt
overwhelm
but
warms
when
you
take
a
drink
its
a
very
complex
and
full
but
its
very
drinkable
i
was
actually
suprised
when
i
finished
it
because
i
was
ready
for
another
shame
it
costs
like
80
dollars
a
case
i
recomend
the
hell
out
of
this
beer
but
like
the
bottle
warns
you
must
be
worthy
of
it
or
it
will
kick
your
ass
haha
pours
a
hazy
orangebrown
color
with
a
slight
head
aroma
is
of
caramel
citrus
and
fresh
bread
great
multitude
of
flavors
here
toasty
malt
notes
with
a
caramel
smoky
chocolate
huskiness
that
coats
the
palate
hops
are
evident
but
are
muted
in
the
presence
of
all
the
alcohol
and
malt
full
mouthfeel
with
medium
carbonation
ends
in
a
viscous
yet
biscuity
feel
that
lingers
alcohol
is
well
integrated
into
flavor
although
you
can
almost
feel
it
hit
your
blood
once
in
the
ol
gutty
works
a
double
dose
of
bastard
does
you
good
i
approve
dark
maroony
amberish
on
the
top
and
lighter
on
the
bottom
multihued
for
sure
pretty
cool
looking
cream
colored
head
that
had
decent
retention
and
good
lace
smell
wasnt
as
strong
as
expected
but
still
sweeet
just
like
the
taste
the
smell
was
well
balanced
tropical
fruity
grapefruity
mildly
piney
roasty
smokey
malty
some
sweetness
too
really
came
through
when
quaffed
great
body
and
carbs
almost
full
body
could
drink
this
all
night
and
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
if
you
ask
me
heard
tons
of
hype
about
this
beer
didnt
quite
live
up
to
it
but
this
is
another
solid
solid
offering
from
one
of
the
top
dogs
ill
have
another
please
d
just
a
superbly
crafted
beer
in
some
ways
the
flavor
is
a
bit
more
mellow
and
refined
than
the
arrogant
bastard
but
i
think
thats
just
a
tribute
to
the
balance
this
beer
has
if
not
for
the
alcohol
i
could
drink
this
beer
all
night
talk
about
a
perfect
winter
beer
though
just
grab
a
glass
of
this
an
get
a
nice
fire
going
in
the
fireplace
and
youll
stay
plenty
warm
think
ill
head
back
to
bevmo
and
stock
up
i
really
wanna
see
how
this
one
ages
pours
a
dark
dark
reddish
amber
color
with
a
beautiful
light
brown
and
foamy
head
that
spills
out
of
the
glass
and
over
the
side
as
it
builds
and
builds
a
great
lacing
just
splatters
the
side
of
the
glass
smell
is
of
hops
and
some
more
hops
grapefruit
and
citrus
and
some
earthy
hops
too
malty
flavor
makes
for
an
initial
sweetness
followed
by
an
intense
bitterness
crisp
carbonation
on
this
beer
as
well
d
very
tasty
and
the
perfect
thing
for
this
time
of
year
high
abv
makes
this
a
sipper
even
though
i
didnt
do
much
of
that
another
very
fine
example
of
craft
brewing
from
the
masters
at
stone
this
was
my
first
time
drinking
this
but
i
am
going
to
go
out
on
a
limb
and
say
it
is
probably
the
best
directly
from
the
brewery
rather
than
out
of
a
bottle
from
a
store
glad
to
finally
try
this
here
highly
recommended
like
all
other
stone
beers
highly
recommended
get
your
hawaiian
shirt
on
stone
has
done
it
again
this
beer
is
what
legends
are
made
of
pours
an
inviting
reddish
brown
with
a
creamy
head
with
an
aroma
that
burst
forth
with
hop
citrus
and
pine
the
beer
is
smooth
and
bubbly
with
the
bitterness
of
the
hops
slowly
coating
the
palate
and
lingers
long
on
the
finish
as
the
beer
breathes
a
bit
the
hops
becomes
more
subtle
and
the
malt
becomes
more
prevalent
albeit
still
subtle
hop
flavors
are
citrus
and
pine
a
balanced
and
memorable
beer
i
was
afraid
this
beer
might
be
too
overthetop
hopwise
but
it
isnt
instead
though
it
is
a
bit
overthetop
in
alcohol
content
i
prefer
a
strong
beer
that
masks
the
alcohol
better
i
do
still
think
its
a
good
beer
but
i
probably
wont
get
it
again
for
a
while
its
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
and
its
one
that
you
have
to
give
a
lot
of
extra
time
for
drinking
d
definitely
a
sipper
this
is
one
big
powerful
and
complex
beer
very
tasty
but
at
times
the
harshness
and
brashness
got
to
me
and
i
found
it
difficult
to
drink
and
i
love
this
extreme
stuff
this
is
a
very
good
interesting
beer
but
i
have
to
be
in
a
particular
mood
to
fully
enjoy
it
another
good
production
from
greg
koch
and
stone
it
is
very
raw
at
this
stage
it
will
be
interesting
to
see
what
a
few
years
do
to
this
one
tastes
like
a
gigantic
load
of
citrus
hops
mammoth
pine
grapefruit
and
a
thick
load
of
bitter
fluid
greets
your
taste
buds
not
a
beer
to
be
enjoyed
for
every
occasion
but
definitely
excellent
surprisingly
thick
feeling
for
a
beer
of
this
type
in
a
word
wow
the
complexity
of
the
beer
made
it
surprisingly
easy
to
drink
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
and
quite
nice
alcohol
wasnt
overpowering
at
all
a
very
enjoyable
beer
for
a
nice
cold
fall
evening
drinkability
is
on
the
lower
side
this
one
pretty
much
burns
with
every
swallow
sure
it
softens
some
as
it
warms
but
it
also
gains
viscosity
frankly
id
normally
lower
pretty
much
every
category
except
for
the
fact
that
its
so
fresh
and
i
assume
its
better
with
age
theres
also
maybe
some
high
score
bias
as
much
as
i
try
to
avoid
that
i
cant
ignore
the
hype
behind
this
one
which
im
not
really
liking
i
love
robust
american
barelywines
but
this
ones
just
harsh
and
im
a
fan
of
extreme
beer
time
will
tell
if
theyre
arrogant
or
just
fooling
themselves
popped
open
a
2006
vintage
to
celebrate
the
sox
winning
the
pennant
poured
it
into
a
belgian
style
snifter
average
sized
head
and
has
a
wonderful
reddish
brown
color
to
it
it
has
a
noticeable
barleywinelike
smell
to
it
with
a
maltiness
that
tingles
the
nose
the
first
sip
was
amazing
it
was
a
lot
smoother
than
i
expected
i
would
compare
this
to
a
fine
old
ale
as
it
warmed
up
it
became
even
easier
to
drink
which
was
when
i
started
to
really
notice
the
high
alcohol
content
this
is
a
great
beer
to
just
sit
back
with
sip
slowly
and
enjoy
another
winner
from
stone
chocolate
brown
mahogany
bronze
to
light
with
a
full
brown
head
sediment
floaters
good
carbonation
and
little
lace
nice
balanced
malt
and
hop
aroma
chocolate
malt
notes
and
piney
hop
aroma
tastes
much
like
it
smells
with
an
overly
bitter
finish
not
pleasantly
hoppy
full
bodied
and
creamy
with
a
harsh
bitter
finish
a
great
beer
highly
recommended
to
all
this
is
far
and
away
better
than
the
original
arrogant
bastard
find
this
beer
now
you
shouldnt
be
wasting
your
time
reading
this
you
should
have
stolen
your
moms
car
and
be
halfway
across
the
state
by
now
d
very
tasty
goes
down
extremely
easily
not
very
filling
this
is
flat
out
just
a
damn
good
beer
i
simply
cant
say
enough
good
things
about
stone
because
they
continue
to
impress
me
even
amongst
the
stone
beers
this
one
is
one
of
the
best
much
thanks
to
jasnm
for
sending
me
this
bottle
in
the
jbif
2006
vintage
served
at
just
about
cellar
temperature
into
a
snifter
from
a
twenty
two
ounce
bottle
poured
out
a
somewhat
thick
amber
brown
color
that
was
quite
hazy
a
pretty
vigorous
pour
yielded
about
two
fingers
of
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
had
decent
retention
a
little
bit
of
sticky
lace
was
left
behind
in
the
glass
the
nose
was
loaded
with
strong
aromas
tons
of
alcohol
up
front
followed
by
the
hops
sweet
malt
rum
soaked
raisins
and
cherries
and
just
a
bit
of
plum
the
nose
is
definitely
dominated
by
alcohol
and
dark
fruits
the
flavor
is
quite
extreme
as
well
dark
fruits
caramel
hops
and
maybe
a
touch
of
chocolate
in
there
a
nice
malt
presence
as
well
finishes
a
bit
dry
with
a
smooth
ten
percent
alcohol
burn
with
little
carbonation
the
alcohol
really
stands
out
in
this
one
seems
pretty
well
balanced
for
the
beast
that
it
is
has
a
full
bodied
thick
syrupy
mouthfeel
that
goes
down
like
a
good
throat
coating
cough
medicine
its
definitely
a
sipper
but
a
damn
good
one
two
thumbs
up
to
stone
brewing
for
another
awesome
yet
enormous
brew
d
very
rich
and
luxurious
and
id
love
to
try
it
again
i
wish
the
upper
midwest
could
get
some
stone
lovin
until
then
i
will
continue
to
trade
for
them
thanks
again
vance
pours
a
muddy
bronze
with
a
cream
head
that
retains
and
only
gives
way
to
thick
sheets
of
lace
smells
of
citrus
hops
caramel
alcohol
and
spice
tastes
syrupy
dark
and
dried
fruit
caramel
sweet
malt
spice
and
alcohol
mouthfeel
is
tremendously
smoooth
wow
this
brew
is
a
delight
and
killer
at
the
same
time
hop
bitterness
lingers
on
the
palate
abv
is
present
but
well
hidden
behind
complexities
what
can
i
say
such
an
original
brew
that
is
a
must
try
has
barleywine
characteristics
with
strong
ale
drinkability
beware
there
are
some
hints
of
alcohol
but
nothing
discouraging
an
abundance
of
brown
sugar
coated
toffee
malt
with
caramel
and
maple
blend
seamlessly
with
a
floral
piney
hop
that
shows
a
bit
of
citrus
on
the
finish
fig
dried
berries
and
mixed
nuts
bring
things
to
fruition
just
an
overall
great
beer
shared
this
with
one
of
my
ba
buddies
this
past
weekend
i
have
always
loved
the
double
bastard
and
this
did
not
let
me
down
it
poured
a
hazy
dark
ruby
orange
with
very
little
to
no
head
the
smell
was
full
of
oily
pine
and
citrus
huge
malts
with
phenols
and
sweet
candied
fruit
taste
was
an
ass
kicking
mouthful
of
sweet
malt
creamy
caramel
and
a
finish
full
of
pine
and
grapefruit
mouthfeel
was
rich
and
creamy
sweet
and
almost
cloying
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
make
this
reasonably
drinkable
for
the
abv
it
definitely
rears
it
strong
head
as
it
warms
but
the
experience
is
so
full
and
rich
you
could
care
less
the
db
is
an
arrogant
cocky
brew
that
is
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
i
however
will
continue
to
enjoy
it
for
years
to
come
nice
red
frothy
pour
and
tons
of
lacing
on
the
glass
not
overly
hoppy
to
me
maybe
i
got
a
bad
bottle
but
extremely
sweet
and
very
boozy
had
some
hop
character
and
some
cherries
plums
and
such
but
dominated
by
alcohol
had
trouble
finishing
the
bottle
id
have
to
give
arrogant
bastard
the
nod
against
the
double
bastard
05
version
sampled
in
07
aroma
is
loaded
with
caramel
and
fruit
hops
are
still
evident
in
the
flavor
balanced
by
sweet
malt
and
subtle
fruitiness
long
grapefruit
finish
still
intact
this
baby
has
really
held
up
well
wish
i
had
more
because
i
dont
think
it
is
anywhere
near
its
peak
first
off
wow
do
not
try
drinking
this
on
an
empty
stomach
because
u
will
be
hammered
anyways
i
found
this
little
jem
hiding
behind
a
few
stone
ipas
and
i
figured
id
give
it
a
shot
wow
was
i
right
for
picking
this
one
very
hoppy
brew
with
scents
and
tastes
of
citrus
very
warming
my
nostrils
were
on
fire
with
scents
and
the
alcohol
smell
was
more
than
apparent
poured
with
nice
head
only
on
a
hard
pour
but
color
was
a
deep
amber
almost
blood
red
very
complex
mix
of
flavors
that
would
have
an
unexperienced
beer
drinker
running
back
to
their
watered
down
beer
in
no
time
body
is
rich
and
full
with
enough
carbonation
to
keep
things
moving
on
the
tongue
not
overly
filling
again
drinkability
only
knocked
down
because
a
little
attention
needs
to
be
paid
to
the
serving
and
pouring
from
a
22oz
bomber
conceivably
into
lowball
glasses
or
snifters
well
anyone
have
another
bottle
i
guess
i
can
call
this
the
second
stone
beer
i
liked
d
dangerous
at
over
10
a
very
excellent
beer
i
have
not
been
disappointed
by
a
stone
brew
yet
highest
recommendation
pours
a
bright
rustbrown
color
with
some
ruby
highlights
and
a
creamy
tan
head
nose
is
incredible
with
aromas
of
tropical
fruit
and
pineapple
rich
caramel
roasted
malt
piney
hops
and
spicy
alcohol
taste
begins
quite
sweet
with
notes
of
brown
sugar
and
rich
caramel
followed
by
some
buttery
toffee
grapefruit
rind
and
piney
hops
come
out
in
a
big
way
towards
the
finish
along
with
some
unsweetened
chocolate
fullbodied
and
oh
so
creamy
smooth
in
fact
this
is
possibly
the
smoothest
10
abv
beer
ive
ever
had
the
privilege
to
drink
magnificent
thanks
to
beerdiablo
for
the
sample
overall
i
think
i
enjoy
a
standard
arrogant
bastard
a
little
more
simply
because
i
never
had
that
strong
alcohol
layer
to
deal
with
if
stone
could
find
a
way
to
get
rid
of
that
effect
it
was
present
in
just
about
every
bottle
within
my
case
then
this
would
trump
the
standard
bastard
i
bet
these
are
great
when
coming
out
of
a
draft
handle
recommended
although
id
have
a
regular
arrogant
bastard
first
for
comparison
d
six
bottles
thats
all
i
could
find
forget
hamlet
the
lack
of
stone
special
release
availability
in
the
dcmetro
area
is
the
real
tragedy
note
it
has
since
gotten
better
drinkability
very
good
i
relished
this
bomber
and
wanted
another
right
away
at
10
or
so
this
could
become
a
real
dangerous
brew
if
i
had
a
lot
of
it
this
is
a
very
luxurious
beer
its
what
a
single
malt
scotch
guy
would
drink
if
he
was
the
designated
driver
that
night
indeed
this
is
the
true
high
life
but
after
one
im
done
save
the
next
one
for
tomorrow
or
at
least
a
few
hours
d
very
drinkable
even
with
the
10
due
to
the
incredible
smoothness
of
this
beer
an
entirely
unique
american
craft
brew
stone
has
really
outdone
themselves
with
this
masterpiece
sublimely
drinkable
i
thank
robert
at
state
line
for
this
22oz
bomber
just
so
i
didnt
have
to
open
my
3
l
yet
d
what
a
treat
pulled
this
gem
from
a
coworker
who
had
to
give
away
his
beer
due
to
medical
reasons
didnt
realize
it
was
2004
until
i
started
drinking
it
i
am
a
big
fan
of
ab
and
am
more
partial
to
oaked
than
double
but
this
was
great
anyone
with
a
case
of
2004
double
be
sure
to
let
me
know
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
rich
and
super
smooth
very
little
alcohol
in
the
finish
drinkability
takes
a
slight
hit
due
to
the
intense
sweetness
and
abv
but
overall
this
is
just
a
beast
of
a
beer
putting
your
palate
in
a
stranglehold
and
not
letting
go
i
really
do
like
this
beer
but
its
not
something
i
could
drink
much
of
bitterness
begins
to
border
on
annoying
by
the
end
of
the
bomber
certainly
a
wonderful
beer
to
share
with
a
friend
god
going
between
these
two
is
hell
as
soon
as
i
get
used
to
one
i
reach
for
the
other
and
find
something
completely
different
i
recommend
double
bastard
uncellared
and
fresh
i
will
be
drunk
soon
just
finishing
this
bomber
and
then
the
first
glass
of
the
cellared
might
just
do
it
10abv
damn
who
wouldnt
be
after
a
few
glasses
of
this
d
better
shared
than
drank
alone
complex
but
boring
worth
a
try
once
but
id
prefer
arrogant
bastard
any
day
you
need
to
have
your
gameface
on
when
preparing
ones
self
for
it
but
a
must
have
overall
i
wish
i
would
have
bought
a
few
more
bottles
to
enjoy
in
0709
guess
i
have
to
start
all
over
again
at
least
i
have
a
12pack
of
2005
old
stock
ale
waiting
to
comfort
me
in
the
years
to
come
its
big
its
bold
its
beautiful
its
a
bastard
of
a
beer
ive
also
decided
to
start
cellaring
with
this
beer
being
the
first
it
surely
has
been
created
by
some
evil
genius
mouthfeel
is
big
creamy
smooth
with
good
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
for
such
a
big
complex
ale
d
drinkability
suffers
due
to
how
boozy
this
sucker
is
the
alcohol
smells
and
flavors
are
very
pervasive
finishing
a
bomber
was
a
bit
of
a
chore
it
wasnt
bad
not
even
close
just
a
little
hard
to
do
d
this
is
a
powerful
brew
that
i
cant
help
but
go
back
for
more
even
as
it
is
kicking
my
ass
towards
the
finish
this
really
smooths
out
or
maybe
im
just
numb
i
love
this
beer
im
not
especially
keen
on
this
version
of
an
asa
because
it
tastes
a
little
too
harsh
for
my
taste
it
doesnt
have
a
lot
of
easily
defineable
tastes
to
me
delicious
beer
but
lowered
the
drinkability
5
due
to
the
10
on
the
palate
crackery
almost
maris
otter
sweetness
first
off
then
things
go
two
ways
simultaneously
theres
growing
caramel
sweetness
and
increasing
metallic
hoppiness
at
the
midpalate
the
sweetness
dissipates
only
a
little
bit
at
the
end
the
sweetness
sticks
around
for
the
most
part
along
with
the
hops
which
attain
some
fruity
height
here
throughout
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
oily
with
hops
in
spite
of
the
malty
goodness
on
display
carbonation
is
slight
overall
this
is
a
definite
step
up
from
the
arrogant
bastard
although
it
could
just
be
the
aging
which
emphasizes
the
malts
a
bit
more
at
the
expense
of
the
hops
quite
good
pours
brown
with
nice
ruby
hints
and
about
a
finger
of
creamy
slightly
offwhite
head
and
minimal
spotty
lacing
smell
is
quite
sweet
while
there
are
other
aromas
present
the
sweetness
is
a
common
theme
various
citrus
notes
are
present
with
grapefruit
and
tangerine
in
the
forefront
accompanied
by
other
fruity
notes
namely
cherries
apples
and
pineapple
at
first
im
hit
with
a
veritable
wave
of
malt
sweetness
the
finish
brings
a
hoppy
flavor
overall
the
taste
is
dominated
by
an
alcoholic
astrigency
that
lingers
and
overshadows
the
other
flavors
mouthfeel
is
good
a
bit
syrupy
drinkability
is
ok
overall
im
not
very
impressed
with
this
brew
i
have
another
bottle
in
the
cellar
and
hopefully
with
another
year
of
so
this
will
mellow
out
nicely
drinkability
very
smooth
easy
to
drink
but
a
bit
high
in
alcohol
d
too
extreme
to
enjoy
it
is
an
attempt
but
they
failed
imo
just
because
its
big
doesnt
make
it
good
this
beer
is
truely
big
and
bad
scoring
imagination
points
with
me
poured
from
a
22oz
bottle
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
rusty
orange
in
color
deep
caramel
malty
aroma
with
some
strong
hints
of
hops
alcohol
and
caramel
and
toffee
in
the
taste
pretty
sweet
tasting
and
sticky
on
the
palate
big
mouthfeel
with
small
drinkability
due
to
high
alcohol
cheers
overall
this
is
a
well
brewed
beer
to
withstand
the
test
of
time
without
time
its
a
nice
offering
for
the
unrefined
palette
that
falls
prey
to
american
micro
beer
marketing
bias
the
percentage
of
people
that
buy
beer
to
age
it
is
very
low
thus
how
should
i
rate
this
beer
comments
cant
say
i
loved
this
ive
had
some
high
abv
barywines
but
whis
was
way
too
over
the
top
the
bitterness
was
too
overpowering
the
sweet
malt
entrance
too
heavy
extreme
does
not
always
result
in
a
well
balanced
beer
this
is
definitely
the
case
here
imho
aaaannndd
the
taste
yikes
these
guys
can
brew
a
ridiculous
beer
this
thing
is
fantastic
the
i
cant
think
how
it
could
possibly
be
better
type
fantastic
its
the
kind
of
beer
that
defines
what
stone
does
and
that
is
create
strong
hefty
beers
enormously
hopped
but
loaded
with
sweet
malts
a
smooth
full
body
with
all
kinds
of
stuff
going
on
clearly
this
isnt
the
ballsiest
beer
they
offer
but
its
kind
of
the
flagship
beer
its
what
they
do
and
what
they
do
is
a
beautiful
thing
pours
a
dark
reddish
color
with
a
head
of
tan
bubbles
that
fades
quickly
aroma
is
on
the
sweet
side
vary
malty
with
only
a
hint
of
citrus
hops
taster
follows
suit
with
a
wonderful
balancedid
i
say
balanced
of
caramel
candy
malts
and
hop
bitterness
actually
the
malt
reminds
me
of
some
of
the
better
english
style
barleywines
hop
bitterness
is
there
for
balance
and
in
the
aftertaste
alcohol
presence
is
noted
but
not
as
intense
as
you
may
think
not
what
i
expected
but
a
great
beer
cheers2beers
d
what
can
i
say
stone
does
it
again
for
the
strength
of
this
beer
i
would
pop
open
another
bomber
without
hesitation
every
flavor
comes
together
to
create
such
a
balanced
and
deceivingly
strong
beer
i
hope
to
have
this
on
tap
when
i
visit
the
brewery
in
may
stone
i
love
you
very
easy
to
drink
for
such
a
high
abv
beer
drinkability
is
surprising
excellent
for
such
a
big
beer
it
is
a
pretty
easy
beer
to
drink
especially
with
an
abv
of
10
note
as
for
a
comparison
with
the
arrogant
bastard
ale
this
offering
is
a
whole
different
beast
pardon
the
pun
the
double
bastard
has
a
substantially
more
intense
and
complex
flavor
profile
also
unlike
the
arrogant
bastard
this
beer
has
balance
overall
a
fantastic
brew
but
suffers
in
the
drinkability
area
as
one
12
oz
serving
filled
me
up
poured
a
clear
amber
brown
color
with
an
average
offwhite
head
that
left
some
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
strong
kind
of
a
pineapple
peach
pine
resin
alcohol
drenched
raisin
scent
to
it
there
is
probably
more
to
it
but
its
hard
to
put
a
finger
on
the
taste
is
a
bit
more
earthy
the
brew
has
a
roasted
malt
backbone
with
a
grapefruit
hoppiness
some
dark
fruity
esters
and
an
alcohol
kick
it
is
a
bit
more
carbonated
that
i
would
think
the
ale
is
well
bodied
and
finishes
a
bitter
the
alcohol
bitterness
and
overall
complexity
of
this
brew
would
limit
me
to
one
bomber
in
a
night
a
tad
over
the
top
but
worth
the
experience
i
still
have
another
bottle
of
this
and
i
was
planning
to
let
it
age
a
bit
but
it
seems
to
be
in
its
prime
right
now
if
not
a
little
beyond
im
in
utter
shock
maybe
the
oak
aging
of
the
ab
just
helped
me
acquire
a
taste
for
this
style
of
brew
i
guess
i
wont
really
know
until
i
try
a
fresh
batch
of
regular
ab
and
compare
it
against
a
fresh
batch
of
double
ab
edit
to
qualify
this
rating
many
people
would
say
that
this
ber
needs
to
be
aged
before
it
gets
really
good
and
mellows
out
well
that
may
be
true
but
in
my
opinion
if
its
not
ready
then
dont
release
it
until
it
is
or
at
least
mention
on
the
bottle
that
it
should
be
aged
rather
then
consumed
immediately
i
have
to
admit
that
i
absolutely
love
this
beer
but
its
actually
a
bit
better
with
about
18
or
so
months
on
it
still
a
fantastic
brew
dark
brownred
smells
sticky
tastes
bitter
somewhat
piney
the
hops
are
still
definitely
alive
and
kicking
the
beer
isnt
as
sweet
as
i
expected
it
to
be
either
this
poured
with
an
offtan
head
with
decent
retention
the
color
was
a
deep
amber
with
nequality
clarity
the
nose
was
somewhat
sweet
and
sugary
the
mouthfeel
was
thick
and
full
with
an
extremely
sweet
taste
like
syrup
the
finish
left
me
licking
my
lips
and
thinking
about
the
extreme
sweetness
that
i
had
experienced
throughout
i
just
could
not
get
past
how
rich
it
seemed
and
that
is
not
my
bag
whats
scary
is
the
drinkability
of
this
ale
so
watch
out
theres
certainly
bitterness
in
there
but
it
doesnt
seem
like
its
a
100
ibu
beer
its
so
smooth
a
bomber
of
this
and
youre
done
for
several
hours
its
a
beautiful
beer
that
everyone
should
try
if
you
can
find
it
poured
a
cloudy
burn
amber
with
no
head
to
speak
of
some
fine
bubbles
and
lots
of
eddys
of
lace
swirling
in
the
top
looks
strong
in
the
snifter
smell
first
hits
you
up
front
with
a
ton
of
alcohol
but
starts
to
mellow
after
a
while
leaving
hints
of
bourbon
and
very
sweet
almost
candy
flavors
some
pine
hops
as
well
in
the
back
smell
really
starts
to
come
out
as
it
warms
for
a
while
the
taste
on
this
was
huge
again
as
it
starts
there
is
the
alcohol
which
at
10abv
is
unmistaken
and
pronounced
this
must
be
let
to
set
to
truly
appresicate
the
other
flavors
mellows
out
into
a
highly
hopped
strong
ale
with
a
big
ddry
finish
huge
pine
and
candied
sweetness
this
is
a
big
beer
with
big
teeth
be
forwarned
i
goes
down
nicely
enough
if
you
are
prepared
for
it
very
dry
and
beautiful
texture
not
oily
and
definatly
not
thin
crisp
tough
this
will
kick
your
ass
it
is
highly
drinkable
at
lest
for
me
it
came
out
as
everything
i
envisioned
it
would
be
arrogant
bastard
or
roids
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
but
for
the
strong
willed
hope
head
heaven
drinkability
this
beer
is
awesome
huge
complex
sweet
a
food
would
have
to
be
very
flavorful
to
stand
up
to
it
a
good
beer
to
end
the
night
after
a
crappy
day
22
oz
bomber
2006
release
it
pours
into
the
chalice
a
dark
redbrown
blood
red
when
held
to
light
that
is
sedimented
or
unfiltered
in
the
second
pour
it
has
light
slowly
rising
carbonation
and
a
light
tan
head
that
reduces
to
a
thin
layer
the
bouquet
is
rich
and
malty
with
lots
of
hops
for
balance
there
are
notes
of
breadybiscuity
caramelly
toasted
and
nutty
malts
chocolate
pineapple
citrus
pine
strawberry
cherry
raspberry
apricot
and
some
vinous
and
woody
notes
the
body
is
thick
with
a
deep
malt
body
and
a
huge
hop
presence
there
are
pineycitric
grapefruit
pineapple
and
greenleafy
hops
with
biscuitytoasty
caramelly
malts
and
notes
of
apple
or
currant
along
with
some
spicy
alcoholic
heat
the
body
is
full
and
drying
quite
smooth
with
light
carbonation
and
a
very
long
finish
overall
this
is
quite
a
heady
brew
one
of
the
maltiest
beers
there
is
yet
is
quite
drinkable
this
is
still
a
bit
young
though
and
ive
got
both
the
04
and
05
to
see
how
the
aging
affects
this
brew
im
guessing
that
the
flavors
would
meld
wonderfully
and
that
the
alcohol
would
cool
down
making
for
an
even
better
beer
p
s
i
would
love
to
see
stone
make
an
oaked
version
of
this
beer
pours
a
lovely
ruby
red
with
a
nice
little
creamy
head
smells
much
like
the
original
bastard
pineapple
grapfruit
and
freshly
cut
grass
on
the
nose
taste
is
like
a
welcome
slap
in
the
face
hops
and
malt
galore
pineapple
and
grapefruit
with
a
fierce
bite
of
alcohol
in
the
finish
perfectly
balanced
in
the
mouth
not
chewy
but
full
only
the
heat
of
the
alcohol
made
me
keep
the
drinkability
down
drinkability
not
a
drink
more
than
one
22oz
bottle
beer
with
the
10
abv
but
very
tasty
i
was
very
pleased
with
this
beer
it
was
a
step
above
its
little
bastard
brother
will
definitely
pick
this
up
when
i
run
across
it
again
poured
from
a
bomber
of
the
2005
release
procured
by
my
girlfriend
as
part
of
a
christmas
present
double
bastard
is
a
deep
ruby
red
with
an
off
white
head
smell
is
rich
sweet
caramel
malts
and
heavy
pine
and
citrusy
grapefruit
aromas
taste
is
big
and
bitter
upfront
tons
of
chinook
flavor
with
the
same
piney
and
grapefruit
flavors
the
sweet
maltiness
isnt
totally
covered
up
and
it
shines
through
towards
the
end
hints
of
alcohol
pop
up
a
bit
as
it
warms
but
its
mostly
hidden
by
the
massive
hop
and
malt
flavor
as
it
warms
it
gets
really
drinkable
i
had
this
yesterday
at
the
ebf
and
i
was
moved
to
open
this
bottle
today
hopefully
ill
be
able
to
find
it
around
here
in
the
near
future
but
im
not
too
sure
wow
pours
a
deep
dark
reddish
brown
with
nice
carbonation
solvent
aromas
with
huge
hop
presence
sticky
sweet
at
first
on
the
tongue
burnt
caramel
some
tropical
malt
breadiness
great
balance
but
so
many
flavors
the
tangy
citrusy
hops
dominate
after
the
sweetness
fades
huge
and
oily
slick
while
at
the
same
time
making
this
heavy
brew
light
tasting
and
refreshing
despite
the
solvent
fumes
the
alcohol
presence
seems
like
a
muted
finely
aged
liqueur
a
slight
burn
but
nothing
to
hint
at
the
high
abv
for
hopheads
this
one
is
the
perfect
pairing
of
traditional
beer
character
and
the
new
generations
hop
craziness
overall
not
a
session
due
to
abv
but
holy
crap
this
is
a
magnificent
and
drinkable
brew
absolutely
stunning
in
its
depth
of
flavor
and
perfect
mouthfeel
tremendous
absolutely
tremendous
even
for
stone
this
beer
poured
a
crystal
clear
mahogany
color
that
had
burnt
orange
red
edges
with
hints
throughout
carbonation
was
very
good
still
for
being
4
years
old
the
head
produced
was
a
tan
cream
color
thick
and
creamy
that
had
a
good
last
time
and
slowly
diminished
in
a
chunky
fashion
to
a
fine
skim
on
the
edges
and
while
being
consumed
it
formed
slowly
on
the
sides
a
dingy
delicateintricate
lace
the
aromas
that
formed
from
the
glass
were
of
molasses
deep
spices
burnt
sugars
sweet
malts
piney
hops
and
a
slight
warmth
of
alcohol
all
fairly
consistent
throughout
the
entire
bottle
becoming
more
prominent
as
beer
warmed
the
tastes
that
danced
across
my
tongue
were
consistent
with
the
aromas
flavors
of
pine
tree
and
floral
hops
several
dark
fruits
apples
berries
etc
all
soaked
in
alcohol
warming
alcohol
notes
sweet
malts
burnt
sugars
and
molasses
wood
tones
all
throughout
and
as
the
sip
ended
a
combination
of
sweetness
and
hops
trailed
off
and
an
aftertaste
of
hops
only
remained
the
body
was
thick
and
chewy
this
beer
for
aging
4
years
held
up
very
well
mellowed
and
blended
nicely
over
time
an
incredible
beer
fresh
and
an
incredible
beer
aged
i
suggest
you
try
both
dthis
beer
is
well
balanced
for
all
that
it
has
going
on
the
high
abv
keeps
it
from
being
an
all
nighter
but
this
is
damn
drinkable
none
the
less
a
great
strong
ale
that
is
to
be
respected
for
sure
the
hops
are
also
floral
at
the
end
tiny
hints
of
sweetness
poke
through
but
very
slight
amongst
the
hoppy
blast
maybe
a
little
too
hoppy
the
mouthfeel
is
that
of
a
strong
dry
hopped
ipa
dry
and
crisp
this
beer
is
very
strong
but
unlike
several
balanced
hopped
beers
the
extreme
flavor
reminds
you
that
its
strong
overall
opening
a
bottle
of
this
size
is
an
occasion
itself
and
the
contents
do
not
disappoint
with
great
bold
flavors
and
aromas
a
nice
one
to
sip
on
a
night
thats
going
to
get
down
to
0
degrees
during
the
second
half
of
the
super
bowl
when
you
know
you
are
going
to
have
to
go
right
to
bed
when
its
over
dark
leather
brown
color
spectacular
head
the
aroma
is
one
of
fruit
and
alcohol
the
taste
is
groovy
the
finish
lets
you
know
that
there
is
some
booze
in
it
my
irish
cheeks
are
now
red
meaning
the
alcohol
is
in
there
2
of
these
will
get
me
through
tonights
super
bowl
be
careful
aquired
via
trade
with
hogtown
harry
ive
been
wanting
to
get
my
hands
on
this
for
a
long
time
so
i
am
very
excited
pours
out
quite
dark
and
cloudier
than
the
regular
aba
nose
is
hops
hops
and
more
hops
first
sip
wow
its
like
getting
hit
in
the
head
with
a
shovel
you
scrape
yourself
off
the
floor
and
ask
for
more
one
of
the
most
bitter
beers
ive
had
booze
tast
is
fairly
evident
and
it
has
quite
a
dry
finish
its
tough
to
describe
the
malt
due
to
the
massive
hop
bill
i
would
love
to
get
my
hands
on
more
of
these
however
this
is
the
poster
child
of
enjoy
in
moderation
hops
complex
malts
good
stuff
holy
schnikes
wow
i
have
been
drinking
alot
of
beer
lately
one
of
these
bombers
is
kickin
me
hard
very
full
over
the
top
flavor
not
for
the
faint
hearted
lite
beer
sipper
thick
chewy
lots
of
alcohol
mama
call
me
a
cab
oh
wait
im
at
home
this
beer
will
kick
you
in
the
keister
i
prefer
the
double
bastard
more
than
the
arrogant
bastard
this
poured
a
dark
foggy
amber
with
a
fairly
think
khaki
colored
head
hops
are
clearly
present
with
a
bit
of
a
malty
woody
background
the
balance
to
this
beer
is
excellent
very
drinkable
for
a
10
abv
definitely
take
your
time
with
this
one
and
enjoy
all
it
has
to
offer
i
love
this
beer
in
a
bottle
and
have
been
rationing
myself
after
purchasing
a
full
case
on
tap
it
seems
so
much
better
balanced
hops
are
present
but
not
in
yer
face
no
alcohol
taste
as
was
presentdiscernible
in
the
bottle
all
in
all
a
real
treat
on
draft
finally
got
to
try
the
double
bastard
after
a
couple
years
of
trying
it
did
not
disappoint
its
amped
up
flavors
are
a
pleasure
to
the
pallette
good
stuff
drinkability
is
pretty
good
this
beer
would
be
odd
without
the
high
abv
but
at
the
same
time
getting
into
more
than
one
bomber
of
this
in
a
short
night
would
be
quite
a
feat
for
me
this
one
put
me
out
mmm
that
was
my
first
thought
when
i
tasted
this
fine
brew
this
is
a
hybrid
between
a
dipa
and
a
barleywine
there
is
a
nice
bitterness
and
the
alcohol
is
noticable
but
not
overpowering
the
taste
is
bitter
and
there
is
an
underlying
sweetness
the
hop
aftertaste
lingers
for
a
good
while
lots
of
lacing
in
the
glass
the
head
is
in
no
hurry
to
leave
one
bomber
of
this
will
really
warm
the
tops
of
your
ears
up
this
beer
just
seemed
an
example
of
trying
to
do
too
much
the
appearance
and
smell
both
seemed
to
bode
well
with
a
very
complex
array
of
scents
and
aromas
everything
from
grasslike
hints
to
a
spicy
cinnamon
i
found
the
taste
to
be
sort
of
all
over
the
place
it
was
very
obtuse
with
a
very
strong
alcohol
feel
throughout
the
hops
seemed
to
work
in
opposition
to
the
early
maltiness
and
the
alcohol
burn
was
another
confounding
factor
with
the
spices
seemingly
out
of
kilter
as
well
it
wasnt
terrible
just
not
particularly
pleasing
the
mouthfeel
was
nice
but
not
really
noteworthy
as
well
i
found
that
the
whole
beer
could
be
summed
up
in
one
word
unbalanced
i
was
surprised
considering
the
amount
of
hype
surrounding
this
brew
ill
keep
my
other
bottle
until
the
07
is
out
had
a
hard
time
finishing
this
bomber
an
overrated
beer
in
my
opinion
drinkabilty
is
excellent
i
expected
this
to
be
more
aggressive
than
ab
but
it
turned
out
to
be
much
smoother
this
beer
is
just
dangerously
drinkable
for
the
10
abv
this
is
a
2005
edition
that
i
had
cellared
away
pours
a
dark
ruddy
brown
that
is
translucent
at
the
edges
foam
was
tightly
bubbled
but
only
held
up
for
a
minute
to
two
the
nose
came
roaring
out
of
the
bottle
and
smacked
me
in
the
olfactory
nerves
this
beer
screams
hops
and
malt
strong
ale
indeed
the
taste
starts
off
appropriately
enough
as
very
malty
but
is
quickly
overtaken
by
the
citrusy
bitter
hops
everything
about
this
beer
is
assertive
even
the
label
the
mouthfeel
was
oily
but
full
this
is
a
big
beer
with
a
big
body
the
drinkability
suffers
from
the
overpowering
flavors
and
the
high
abv
i
was
belching
hops
far
into
the
wee
small
hours
of
the
morning
perhaps
im
just
not
worthy
drinkablity
i
could
see
myself
drinking
this
again
but
not
at
the
same
because
then
i
wouldnt
know
where
i
was
or
what
i
was
doing
at
that
time
i
have
to
say
that
its
a
very
dangerous
a
beer
before
you
know
it
you
drank
half
of
it
and
youre
feeling
a
bit
tipsy
if
you
wish
to
drink
the
beer
the
klingon
stone
gargoyle
on
the
label
would
drink
then
try
this
beer
immediately
it
is
true
what
they
say
its
one
muther
of
a
beer
double
bastard
did
make
the
perfect
beer
to
celebrate
pepetons
birthday
if
you
read
this
please
send
him
a
happy
birthday
beermail
he
will
enjoy
it
huge
ovation
for
stone
they
put
together
a
masterpiece
with
this
beer
every
aspect
of
the
flavor
is
well
defined
yet
at
the
same
time
merges
perfectly
into
the
next
flavor
this
is
a
must
have
for
anyone
especially
if
you
like
regular
aba
with
a
few
months
to
a
year
in
the
cellar
i
could
see
this
beer
being
pretty
much
perfect
im
a
huge
fan
of
aba
though
so
i
might
be
a
slight
bit
bias
d
excellent
brew
by
stone
especially
in
the
22oz
bottle
an
odd
cross
between
a
hopped
up
barleywine
and
a
strong
dipa
gotta
love
what
stone
offers
get
it
if
you
can
but
beware
of
the
high
abv
as
your
drinking
it
those
bastards
will
getcha
i
really
like
this
beer
but
one
bottle
is
enough
for
the
night
and
i
would
only
want
something
this
intense
ever
once
in
a
while
note
this
went
well
with
san
diegos
own
chuao
spicy
mayan
chocolate
served
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
brownishred
color
with
about
an
inch
offwhite
head
it
smells
very
nice
like
caramel
hops
cherries
and
a
bit
of
a
spicy
smell
it
tastes
very
hoppy
like
grapefruit
pine
and
some
malt
overall
the
taste
is
very
strong
and
hoppy
and
a
bit
harsh
at
times
the
mouthfeel
is
almost
syrupy
its
on
the
thicker
side
and
its
full
bodied
drinkability
is
good
but
not
excellent
i
dont
think
i
could
drink
more
than
one
of
these
at
a
time
but
i
would
definitely
drink
it
again
a
truly
great
beer
dont
pass
this
by
youll
love
it
even
if
you
like
me
arent
a
hophead
nice
somewhat
sweet
on
the
intake
squashed
with
a
nice
bitter
hop
bite
man
this
is
good
seems
like
a
mix
of
strong
ale
and
double
ipa
i
will
definately
pick
this
up
if
i
can
come
across
it
stones
distribution
is
still
somewhat
limited
here
in
wa
thanks
to
dogfood
for
bringing
this
up
from
cali
over
the
holidays
dark
red
maybe
a
bit
brown
in
color
fitted
with
an
offwhite
colored
head
behind
some
sticky
lacing
fruity
smell
as
well
as
a
smell
i
can
only
describe
as
rotten
pine
taste
was
good
and
hoppy
certainly
a
nice
malt
base
here
too
i
do
have
to
say
some
of
the
bitterness
had
some
harshness
to
it
harshness
does
not
equal
badass
heavier
side
of
medium
bodied
and
a
medium
amount
of
carbonation
overall
good
beer
for
sure
but
i
cant
help
but
think
a
different
hop
choice
could
make
this
so
much
better
dont
take
the
above
comment
the
wrong
way
its
just
my
opinion
and
stone
does
a
damn
fine
job
as
it
is
would
buy
again
thick
consentency
spit
like
youve
been
drinking
coffee
i
prefer
the
original
ab
but
this
is
a
good
double
but
would
like
to
age
one
and
see
if
the
sweetness
eases
up
i
recomend
one
of
these
followed
by
a
ruination
an
excellent
offering
this
one
would
be
perfect
to
enjoy
with
pepper
jack
cheese
another
spectacular
brew
from
an
awesome
brewery
defintly
try
it
if
oyu
get
the
chance
the
head
is
very
frothy
and
stays
throughout
the
beer
it
also
has
a
great
super
dark
color
to
it
the
taste
is
very
nice
and
very
hoppy
but
had
some
harshness
to
it
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
dry
the
drinkability
was
ok
nothing
to
freak
out
about
poured
translucent
dark
amber
with
thinnest
ring
of
head
around
edge
smells
of
sweet
malt
mostly
with
only
a
small
citrusy
hop
smell
initial
fruity
banana
taste
switching
to
a
dark
malt
and
hop
bitterness
very
interesting
hop
comes
through
in
a
bitter
and
resiny
taste
acidic
hop
bite
mellows
to
a
mild
sweetness
lower
carbonation
with
a
decent
mouthfeel
only
slightly
bubbly
smoother
than
expected
and
not
as
harsh
or
abusive
as
standard
ab
decent
drinkability
for
10
and
i
will
be
a
fan
of
this
every
year
it
is
released
d
i
couldnt
imagine
drinking
more
than
one
of
these
this
is
huge
in
every
department
it
could
use
a
few
years
aging
before
being
bottled
its
good
but
i
feel
its
alittle
unbalanced
it
needs
alittle
more
maltiness
to
it
to
counteract
the
immense
amount
of
hops
not
exactly
what
i
was
hoping
for
but
still
pretty
good
i
think
this
beer
has
some
aging
potential
poured
out
a
really
pretty
clear
dark
caramel
color
with
a
big
bubbly
bone
white
head
leaving
behind
big
sticky
lacing
the
nose
offers
grapefruit
alcohol
yeast
malt
hops
melon
and
candy
the
taste
gives
rotten
apple
apricot
bad
melon
alcohol
big
bitter
green
hops
spice
persimmon
and
even
some
mike
tyson
sweat
dont
ask
the
mouthfeel
is
spicy
the
tight
carbonation
is
nearly
painful
howd
they
do
that
the
alcohol
wasnt
terribly
masked
its
a
bit
much
to
really
drink
more
than
one
but
drinking
one
is
a
treat
good
stuff
oh
by
the
way
after
i
finished
the
first
glass
and
half
way
through
the
second
i
found
the
alcohol
very
warming
a
very
drinkable
beer
that
i
am
very
glad
i
finally
had
the
chance
to
taste
smooth
but
dangerous
as
the
10
abv
is
totally
hidden
in
the
taste
simply
delicious
and
awesome
dark
brown
to
red
beer
with
bits
of
dirtlike
sediment
big
head
odor
is
piney
and
sprucey
hops
also
some
alcohol
on
the
nose
as
well
taste
is
really
a
lot
of
bitter
hops
moving
into
a
more
mellow
sour
hop
clavor
a
fair
amount
of
alcohol
in
the
flavor
as
well
fairly
heavy
and
sticky
overall
just
like
a
hopped
up
version
of
ab
no
surprize
really
and
im
not
sure
it
works
all
that
well
for
me
pine
orange
zest
tons
of
caramel
toasty
fruit
cake
notes
and
a
very
substantial
mouthfeel
its
pretty
narrow
but
extremely
concentrated
a
bit
too
hopped
for
my
personal
atstes
but
a
well
made
beer
and
you
can
taste
and
feel
how
costly
the
grain
bill
must
have
been
rich
redbrown
with
a
thin
tan
head
and
slight
orange
tints
looks
nice
nose
is
hoppy
but
with
a
good
malt
balance
and
some
slight
spicing
taste
is
super
hops
but
theres
an
interesting
play
of
various
hop
flavors
it
evolves
in
your
mouth
still
its
all
hops
and
a
tad
syrupy
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
both
good
as
well
this
is
a
season
favorite
that
goes
fast
and
with
good
reason
pours
a
deep
dark
amber
with
a
thin
tan
head
with
little
head
retention
its
smell
is
of
citrus
and
fruit
with
some
nice
barely
notes
a
nice
pleasant
aroma
the
taste
hits
hard
strong
and
sharp
with
the
same
citrus
flavor
and
some
caramel
qualities
too
this
is
potent
flavor
and
not
for
light
beer
drinkers
its
a
very
robust
and
sharp
mouthfeel
that
is
very
pleasant
i
cant
rate
the
drinkability
too
high
as
this
stuff
is
powerful
and
after
one
bottle
im
reeling
if
i
could
handle
10
abv
better
id
rate
it
higher
my
only
major
qualm
with
this
beer
is
that
its
so
damn
tasty
but
i
cant
stomach
too
much
too
fast
this
is
a
definate
sipper
if
you
can
find
this
beer
be
sure
to
share
it
with
a
deserving
friend
or
relative
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
very
heavy
and
sharp
obviously
one
bottle
is
good
enough
for
an
evening
a
very
sippable
and
drinkable
beer
i
may
have
to
grab
another
bottle
to
age
i
heard
its
better
that
way
pours
a
big
bubbly
head
that
leaves
lacing
around
the
whole
glass
when
cold
the
taste
is
much
sweeter
than
the
regular
arrogant
bastard
as
it
warms
the
other
flavors
come
through
not
as
harsh
as
the
regular
arrogant
bastard
but
there
is
just
as
much
complexity
maybe
a
bit
smoother
and
more
drinkable
than
the
regular
arrogant
bastard
which
is
surprising
since
the
alcohol
is
heavier
here
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
this
is
a
really
great
beer
very
good
very
nice
very
stone
brewery
i
love
it
d
great
to
sip
but
the
boldness
of
flavor
and
alcohol
content
do
effect
the
drinkability
oelergud
d
big
time
alcohol
presence
takes
away
from
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
slightly
however
some
time
in
the
cellar
would
almost
certainly
change
that
a
sipping
brew
for
sure
this
is
a
sure
thing
every
winter
excellent
overall
i
was
disappointed
with
this
beer
which
was
a
surprise
because
i
like
more
extreme
brews
i
probably
wont
try
this
again
unless
it
has
aged
for
a
while
drinks
pretty
good
just
a
little
too
hefty
to
session
on
especially
when
they
are
served
up
in
bombers
this
is
a
nice
strong
ale
but
overpriced
imo
i
doubt
ill
buy
this
next
year
just
aint
up
to
the
hype
might
be
worth
cellaring
but
not
at
this
price
for
its
strength
and
bitterness
this
beer
is
damned
drinkable
next
time
im
not
sharing
it
i
would
purchase
this
beer
again
but
i
would
cellar
it
for
a
little
those
two
bastards
are
mischievous
little
gargoyles
and
i
plan
on
harnessing
their
strength
and
agility
pours
a
deep
brown
with
a
nice
foamy
head
retention
isnt
bad
as
it
leaves
a
thin
head
throughout
and
nice
lacing
smells
of
caramel
fruit
and
notes
of
alcohol
taste
is
sweet
and
bitter
fruity
at
first
then
malty
then
a
nice
hoppy
kick
to
the
aftertaste
the
carbonation
is
great
and
its
not
as
thick
as
10
abv
would
make
me
assume
for
its
alcohol
content
its
very
easy
to
drink
this
i
didnt
really
start
loving
this
beer
until
halfway
through
it
takes
a
few
sips
once
i
hit
that
halfway
mark
i
couldnt
stop
thinking
how
great
this
tastes
maybe
this
beer
needs
some
more
aging
but
i
didnt
really
care
for
it
this
is
an
incredible
brew
nicely
balanced
with
the
hops
in
control
in
the
end
fresh
full
tasty
and
complex
this
is
an
amazing
brew
and
the
beer
gods
rejoiced
cheers
the
bottom
line
i
really
like
arrogant
bastard
and
double
bastard
is
like
a
bigger
heavier
version
of
the
same
thing
with
a
bigger
grapefruit
tang
exceptional
stuff
and
highly
recommended
to
me
this
one
is
the
winner
of
the
ab
family
but
its
surely
one
to
be
drinken
with
care
this
is
a
double
rating
sort
of
a
blind
test
i
poured
the
beer
into
2
duvel
glasses
not
knowing
which
year
was
which
1st
is
for
the
2006
and
the
2nd
is
for
2004
what
a
difference
between
these
2
bottles
the
06
was
just
loaded
with
hops
and
the
o4
was
more
malty
06
poured
a
clear
garnet
with
a
tan
head
aroma
citrus
orange
grapefruit
grassy
with
a
touch
of
lemon
than
a
bit
of
alcohol
sugar
flavor
dry
hop
semisweet
grapefruit
with
a
squirt
of
orange
on
it
with
nice
alcohol
bite
at
the
finish
now
the
04
pored
a
cloudy
garnet
with
a
big
tan
head
aroma
honey
malt
brown
sugardark
fruits
with
a
hint
of
yeast
and
alcohol
molasses
flavor
wow
the
alcohol
jumps
right
out
there
in
the
for
front
followed
by
some
roasted
malts
dark
honey
with
raisins
this
is
so
much
smoother
and
easy
to
drink
than
the
06
my
ratings
for
these
2
different
but
the
same
beers
would
be
the
same
even
though
i
like
the
04
better
really
the
beer
is
quite
good
i
went
from
disappointed
to
it
being
one
of
my
favorite
beers
but
to
each
his
own
i
would
recommend
giving
it
a
chance
pours
an
amberbrown
color
with
bright
orange
highlights
when
held
up
to
the
light
appealing
aroma
of
sweet
dark
and
caramel
malts
dark
fruit
and
some
brown
sugar
along
with
a
noticeable
alcohol
presence
palate
is
a
rich
and
complex
blend
of
malty
sweetness
dark
fruit
and
brown
sugar
up
front
a
subtle
hoppy
bitterness
emerges
before
the
swallow
and
lingers
long
into
the
aftertaste
balancing
things
out
a
bit
notes
of
figs
and
prunes
come
through
on
the
finish
body
is
velvety
smooth
a
great
complement
to
the
rich
intermingling
of
flavors
in
the
palate
very
drinkable
for
such
a
strong
beer
and
the
perfect
accompaniment
to
a
bowl
of
mushroom
barley
soup
on
a
cold
night
as
usual
a
wonderful
offering
from
stone
the
mouthfeel
is
very
slick
and
full
glides
over
the
tongue
quite
easily
but
the
drinkability
suffers
a
bit
due
to
the
hotness
of
the
alcohol
but
for
the
style
its
pretty
drinkable
i
guess
finishing
a
bomber
myself
was
a
chore
so
i
would
reccomend
splitting
this
with
a
friend
overall
though
the
db
is
another
exceptionally
crafted
brew
from
stone
this
stuff
stops
you
in
your
tracks
2005
bottle
pours
a
dark
ruby
color
with
creamy
tan
head
i
got
a
nose
full
of
candy
sugar
cherry
caramel
toffee
and
pungant
hops
fruity
sweet
golden
raisin
and
an
pleasant
alcohol
burn
very
smooth
rolls
over
the
tongue
nicly
a
fine
drink
but
not
one
of
my
faves
a
very
tastey
strong
ale
much
bolder
in
all
dimensions
than
the
ab
duh
hence
the
double
and
more
to
my
liking
if
it
was
called
a
dipa
no
one
would
think
twice
a
must
try
spectacularly
smooth
with
a
chewy
body
this
is
some
complex
stuff
with
flavor
characteristics
of
caramelized
sugar
and
fresh
fruit
battling
it
out
over
a
port
background
this
is
absoulely
fantastic
though
i
still
cant
see
what
this
has
to
do
with
the
arrogant
bastard
which
try
as
i
might
i
simply
cannot
enjoy
alcohol
is
well
masked
in
this
all
the
flavors
come
together
nicely
here
for
a
well
balanced
beergasm
on
your
tongue
i
only
purchased
4
of
these
but
i
think
its
time
to
head
back
to
the
store
and
grab
a
few
more
before
theyre
gone
an
attractive
dark
redbrown
color
with
garnet
highlights
and
a
descent
sized
sticky
tan
head
nose
characters
are
of
caramel
malts
roasted
nutty
grains
dark
fruits
bing
cherry
and
a
little
alcoholic
tingle
taste
consists
of
toasted
barley
brown
sugar
sour
cherries
carmel
and
big
nutty
malt
notes
a
boozy
alcoholic
punch
is
prominent
from
the
start
and
maybe
a
little
metallic
balanced
well
by
some
spicy
bitter
hop
characters
the
mouthfeel
is
really
pleasant
with
a
medium
body
leaving
a
oily
slick
coating
and
fizzy
on
the
edges
pale
malt
characters
come
on
towards
the
end
im
not
done
with
this
beer
because
for
some
reason
i
really
want
to
like
it
ill
buy
a
couple
to
cellar
for
2
and
4
years
and
ill
probably
try
another
fresh
one
this
year
maybe
i
just
got
a
crappy
bottle
but
i
highly
doubt
it
this
should
be
sold
to
brohams
at
the
xgames
because
its
so
xtreeeeme
gotta
say
i
really
like
it
after
the
time
in
the
cellar
its
entirely
different
now
more
powerful
than
arrogant
bastard
and
just
as
good
i
could
buy
either
and
be
completely
happy
with
it
a
sidebyside
tasting
is
necessary
but
theyre
both
winners
and
double
bastard
kicks
ass
of
all
the
bastard
choices
this
is
my
favorite
im
actually
not
that
big
a
fan
of
regular
old
bastard
but
this
one
is
dang
good
considering
the
high
abv
and
the
enormous
characteristics
this
beer
isnt
that
drinkable
but
very
enjoyable
for
what
it
is
i
consider
ab
to
be
very
overrated
and
this
probably
is
as
well
but
i
enjoy
this
one
more
than
the
regular
bastard
and
the
oaked
bastard
i
wouldnt
mind
storing
a
couple
of
these
in
the
cellar
for
a
while
since
i
actually
enjoy
the
regular
bastard
when
its
a
little
older
and
this
one
would
be
that
much
better
a
great
beer
and
a
nice
beer
to
start
the
cold
months
out
with
get
this
if
you
can
you
will
not
be
disappointed
you
people
on
the
coasts
with
easy
access
to
this
have
my
envy
the
drinkability
is
surprisingly
good
for
something
with
so
much
hop
bitterness
at
least
one
22oz
bottle
will
be
pretty
easy
to
finish
final
notes
a
dramatic
and
intoxicating
beer
believe
the
hype
poured
into
pint
glass
pours
an
amazing
reddish
brown
with
a
foamy
head
that
stays
the
entire
drink
smell
is
of
sweet
nector
with
that
alcohol
smell
taste
is
sweetness
like
honey
with
that
strong
alcohol
finish
this
beer
is
not
for
the
light
hearted
this
is
pretty
awesome
and
needs
to
be
sipped
to
truly
enjoy
the
double
bastard
greatness
double
bastard
ale
lives
up
to
the
hype
its
a
beer
that
will
kick
your
ass
up
one
side
and
down
the
other
and
will
earn
your
respect
and
adoration
while
doing
so
thanks
to
greg
and
the
boys
at
stone
for
continuing
to
release
quality
beer
after
quality
beer
that
more
often
than
not
defines
the
style
in
which
it
is
brewed
this
is
a
by
the
case
brew
if
ive
ever
tasted
one
mouthfeel
was
medium
to
full
with
an
alcohol
sizzle
overall
it
is
exactly
what
it
says
it
is
arrogant
bastard
x
2
good
but
nothing
very
different
just
bigger
and
hoppier
d
i
want
more
more
more
but
also
more
citrus
overall
this
beer
aint
for
everyone
im
a
hophead
so
i
love
it
if
you
love
big
beers
this
is
a
beer
for
you
d
for
me
i
find
this
much
better
than
the
other
bastards
which
i
like
a
lot
this
is
the
one
to
get
if
you
can
find
it
double
the
pleasure

and
almost
half
the
price
of
oaked
ab
double
bastard
has
a
slightly
more
rounded
flavor
than
the
standard
arrogant
bastard
the
malt
is
more
pronounced
completely
engulfing
the
palate
at
first
though
the
hops
do
come
through
quite
strongly
in
the
finish
alcohol
is
noticeable
and
warming
the
aroma
leaps
out
of
the
glass
fruity
yeast
caramelized
malt
powerful
pine
and
citrus
hops
the
appearance
is
equally
impressive
with
a
moderatebutlingering
head
curtains
of
lace
and
a
translucent
ruby
color
this
isnt
something
id
care
to
drink
in
large
quantities
but
its
a
great
beer
to
share
with
a
friend
during
the
winter
months
pours
a
translucent
red
color
with
a
moderate
head
smell
is
terrific
with
hints
of
candied
fruits
and
a
surprising
amount
of
alcohol
the
taste
is
huge
as
well
with
the
malts
lingering
the
whole
way
down
the
throat
the
hops
are
big
and
chewey
and
provide
a
terrific
balance
to
the
dark
malts
the
texture
is
also
enjoyable
with
a
creamy
consistancy
and
a
huge
aftertaste
a
really
enjoyable
beer
a
superb
beer
from
stone
its
not
just
more
of
what
you
love
in
arrogant
bastard
but
lots
of
different
little
nuances
and
tidbits
in
the
flavor
that
are
a
wonderful
addition
to
its
kid
brothers
wonderful
foundation
a
must
have
beer
especially
if
you
like
arrogant
bastard
ale
yet
another
example
of
why
stone
is
one
of
the
top
brewers
out
there
ive
got
a
couple
bombers
stashed
to
see
how
db
does
with
a
little
age
on
it
but
i
have
a
feeling
i
might
not
be
able
to
keep
from
drinking
them
for
long
another
good
offering
from
stone
this
is
pretty
much
a
barleywine
and
was
once
classified
as
such
on
the
site
if
im
not
mistaken
whatever
it
is
its
very
good
not
transcendent
but
very
good
i
must
say
i
prefer
arrogant
bastard
to
this
but
thats
less
a
knock
on
this
beer
than
it
is
a
compliment
to
ab
would
probably
benefit
greatly
from
aging
recommended
drink
and
treat
as
a
barleywine
drinkability
great
stuff
the
alcoholic
warming
effect
is
just
right
for
the
time
of
year
and
the
nose
is
pretty
much
perfect
really
should
be
classified
as
an
american
barleywine
in
my
opinion
however
da
this
is
one
heady
ale
10
booom
one
autumn
morning
after
receiving
the
signal
from
above
the
servants
collected
oak
barrels
lined
with
honey
and
bourbon
miraculously
the
tree
began
to
perspire
the
sweetest
nectar
imaginable
and
the
children
of
the
village
laughed
and
danced
as
never
before
on
this
day
double
bastard
ale
was
born
unto
the
world
let
us
be
glad
and
rejoice
this
beer
pours
a
deep
clear
mahogony
with
a
huge
tan
foamy
head
a
truely
impressive
looking
beer
the
smell
is
a
mix
of
sweetness
and
hops
citrus
hops
grapefruit
and
tangerinepineapple
pine
and
a
bisquity
aroma
make
this
a
very
aromatic
beer
the
taste
has
hop
bitterness
alcohol
sweet
malt
bread
yeast
citrus
and
pineapple
fruit
and
a
hint
of
carmel
the
mf
is
medium
with
all
the
flavors
mixing
very
well
this
is
an
outstanding
beer
that
should
not
be
missed
being
on
the
east
coast
im
lucky
i
found
a
store
that
sells
stone
cheers
side
note
even
if
this
beer
had
sucked
the
writing
on
the
bottle
alone
would
have
been
worth
the
six
bucks
alcohol
was
a
bit
much
for
a
bomber
mouthfeel
is
heavy
and
quite
viscous
surprisingly
this
is
not
overly
syrupy
quite
the
drinkable
sipping
brew
this
strong
ale
lives
up
to
its
name
but
it
was
too
intense
for
me
to
really
enjoy
it
i
definitely
had
to
drink
it
slow
so
finishing
the
bomber
by
myself
was
no
easy
task
i
think
i
will
be
glad
to
let
this
one
age
at
least
a
year
or
two
and
try
it
again
edit
great
but
no
way
i
could
have
more
than
one
of
these
big
in
the
mouth
with
an
almost
syrupy
texture
that
is
kept
in
check
by
the
carbonation
despite
its
size
and
arrogance
i
could
drink
dangerous
amounts
of
this
beer
well
worth
the
6
this
awesome
beer
looks
basically
identical
to
the
arrogant
bastard
the
realy
difference
in
this
beer
is
taste
theres
a
lot
more
of
it
if
you
can
believe
that
this
is
an
awesome
beer
its
got
all
the
malts
and
hops
any
beer
drinker
could
appreciate
i
would
have
to
say
i
like
it
more
than
ab
its
pretty
damn
potent
at
10
but
very
drinkable
i
like
it
better
as
it
warms
up
a
bit
from
fridge
temp
and
i
have
been
allowing
it
to
sit
outside
of
the
fridge
before
popping
it
open
if
you
like
arrogant
bastard
you
will
like
this
as
well
overall
a
surprisingly
mild
double
the
flavor
is
nice
but
the
alcohol
should
be
masked
more
for
my
taste
i
will
say
that
after
2
of
these
and
reading
the
back
of
the
bottles
it
appears
that
someone
went
way
overboard
on
the
thesaurus
useage
but
damn
thats
a
big
beer
d
the
only
disappointing
thing
about
this
beer
is
that
i
only
have
one
bottle
absolutely
mammoth
beer
noticably
more
alcohol
than
the
arrogant
bastard
but
the
depth
and
complexity
was
mindboggling
every
sip
was
chock
full
of
character
roasted
dark
chocolate
notes
a
little
bit
of
dried
fruit
notes
a
lot
of
stuff
going
on
but
it
was
a
unified
arrogant
beast
all
the
same
god
i
love
this
beer
another
expertly
crafted
brew
from
stone
note
this
stuff
will
age
very
well
if
you
have
the
patience
i
loved
the
bastard
i
guess
i
adore
the
bastard
squared
i
have
10
left
i
need
at
least
another
24
for
the
winter
thanks
nate
overall
quite
good
and
i
will
happily
drink
again
still
trying
to
decide
what
i
think
about
double
vs
single
bastards
probably
different
enough
that
a
comparison
is
irrelevant
as
a
final
thought
i
am
curious
to
see
what
some
age
will
do
to
the
other
bottles
i
secured
cheers
stop
what
you
are
doing
go
buy
the
remaining
reserves
at
your
local
bottle
shoppe
grab
and
dash
if
you
have
to
theyll
never
catch
you
overall
dab
rules
all
the
hype
is
on
point
with
this
brew
highly
recommended
if
you
can
find
it
d
it
is
very
good
i
think
i
preferred
the
2005
i
tried
it
in
06
so
im
not
sure
if
its
due
to
it
being
a
year
old
or
they
are
made
in
different
places
it
is
a
sipper
the
alcohol
just
finds
it
way
through
a
lot
on
this
than
the
05
im
also
going
to
the
store
tomorrow
to
buy
whatever
they
may
have
left
of
this
liquid
pleasure
really
nice
but
not
my
favorite
stone
beer
i
wouldnt
say
im
wimping
away
from
the
db
its
just
that
stone
10th
and
even
ruination
are
so
much
better
tasting
fullbodied
oily
but
somewhat
creamy
on
the
palate
very
drinkable
for
a
beer
of
this
magnitude
i
cant
wait
to
try
this
thing
with
a
few
months
under
its
belt
when
the
malt
matures
the
balance
could
use
a
little
bit
of
work
but
thats
nothing
some
cellar
time
wont
fix
still
a
great
drink
even
now
the
bastard
has
set
me
free
im
so
glad
that
i
got
this
years
bottle
i
cant
wait
to
have
the
other
bottle
that
i
got
in
a
few
years
should
age
phenomenally
i
have
known
the
bastard
and
the
bastard
has
set
me
free
poured
a
very
dark
hazy
amber
hue
glows
a
gorgeous
orange
red
when
back
lit
nice
two
finger
offwhite
tanish
head
that
dissipated
over
a
few
tastes
no
real
lacing
present
smells
of
sweet
caramel
and
malt
hints
of
oak
with
a
grainy
and
sweet
raisin
yeast
smell
in
the
distance
there
are
subtle
tones
of
butterscotch
and
toffee
mixed
in
it
tastes
very
smooth
and
quite
delectable
sweet
malt
flavor
with
mild
hints
of
roasted
malt
mixed
with
caramel
malts
great
after
taste
mild
dry
hop
finish
with
buttery
tones
butterscotch
and
a
slight
fruit
flavoring
figs
and
or
plum
come
to
mind
great
body
very
smooth
and
drinkable
for
being
10abv
no
lingering
alcohol
flavor
it
is
hidden
really
well
in
the
mix
of
flavors
this
beer
has
such
a
great
balance
and
array
of
flavor
the
10
sneaks
up
on
you
pretty
well
this
beer
is
well
crafted
and
extremely
drinkable
i
enjoyed
this
22oz
bottle
until
the
last
drop
great
american
strong
ale
offering
i
recommend
everyone
give
this
one
a
shot
if
you
can
get
your
hands
on
it
it
is
definitely
enjoyable
but
feel
it
could
be
more
complex
im
inclined
to
think
that
id
prefer
a
nosferatu
or
hibernation
ale
drinkability
is
great
doesnt
feel
like
10
pretty
well
balanced
even
without
the
fresh
hoppy
aroma
that
it
would
have
had
fresh
notes
an
outstanding
strong
beer
by
stone
so
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
for
a
strong
beer
i
enjoyed
this
by
an
outside
fire
with
my
fiance
and
a
good
friend
and
his
wife
perfect
setting
for
this
beer
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
it
and
will
get
a
bottle
any
time
i
see
it
2005
release
pours
a
chestnutmahogany
color
with
a
thick
fluffy
tan
head
the
head
holds
well
considering
the
10
abv
hop
aroma
explodes
out
of
the
bottle
caramel
covered
piney
hops
along
with
a
bit
of
citrusy
notes
as
well
alcohol
is
present
in
the
aroma
as
well
very
deep
malt
flavor
holds
its
own
against
the
hops
the
malt
will
not
back
down
warming
alcohol
presence
a
bit
of
age
may
have
rounded
this
out
medium
to
full
body
with
ample
carbonation
for
10
abv
this
goes
down
well
too
well
just
an
abundance
of
flavors
and
not
onesided
this
is
an
exceptional
brew
bottle
split
with
dirtylou
during
my
stay
in
madison
2004
vintage
mouthfeel
is
fairly
smooth
before
the
burn
sets
in
i
will
finish
this
but
like
i
said
i
have
to
try
it
fresh
and
review
that
bottle
at
10
abv
i
expect
to
notice
the
alcohol
but
not
this
much
rock
my
world
bottle
poured
a
deep
amber
color
ale
with
a
small
foamy
head
with
minimal
retention
aroma
of
heavy
sweet
malt
with
a
strong
dose
of
bitter
hops
taste
is
really
sweet
with
a
heavy
dose
of
sweet
malt
plus
a
strong
bitter
hops
presence
body
is
above
average
with
no
discernable
trace
of
alcohol
very
good
try
at
bringing
a
lot
of
extreme
side
to
a
beer
while
conserving
some
balance
drinkability
at
10
one
is
enough
but
it
is
so
incredibly
balanced
and
complex
you
want
more
than
one
this
is
what
a
dipa
should
be
it
has
its
competitors
but
may
well
be
the
best
dipa
in
the
world
imo
from
the
2005
batch
the
months
of
aging
have
made
this
beer
incredibly
well
balanced
pours
a
lovely
deep
reddish
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
sweet
and
malty
with
a
hint
of
hops
lurking
in
the
background
taste
is
sublime
big
malty
flavor
with
the
hops
nicely
balanced
alchohol
is
obvious
but
not
distracting
lots
of
vanilla
in
the
taste
absolutely
delicious
a
beer
to
sip
and
savor
2005
vintage
pours
dark
copper
to
orange
and
red
with
a
cream
to
tan
head
you
can
tell
this
beer
is
big
from
the
smell
smells
of
rich
malts
sweet
caramel
some
tart
cherryred
wine
aroma
some
pruniness
and
alcohol
also
present
in
the
aroma
rich
sweet
malts
and
caramel
are
up
front
and
quickly
intermingle
with
strong
alcohol
presence
a
good
size
slightly
piney
dry
bitterness
in
the
finish
and
then
an
alcohol
warmth
in
the
throat
great
strong
ale
the
alcohol
is
definitely
a
presence
but
is
not
too
strong
to
enjoy
but
rather
balanced
by
the
large
malt
bill
and
the
hops
are
also
large
and
create
a
nice
finish
i
look
forward
to
how
this
ages
2005
vintage
tap
sample
from
the
freakin
frog
brown
in
colour
with
hints
of
amber
low
carbonation
powerful
sweet
malt
aroma
with
a
nice
light
hoppy
citrus
fruit
although
not
cascade
or
centennial
from
what
i
could
tell
overlay
more
of
the
same
in
the
mouth
with
a
bit
of
an
alcohol
presence
but
what
surprised
me
was
the
lighter
than
expected
body
of
this
beer
the
solid
bitterness
that
kept
everything
in
check
too
a
very
drinkable
beer
for
its
size
well
done
stone
oh
man
oh
man
oh
man
oh
wow
this
is
a
freaking
great
beer
period
if
we
ever
have
children
the
kids
name
is
stone
boy
or
girl
true
dat
bastard
drinkability
well
i
could
not
imagine
having
a
three
liter
bottle
of
this
stuff
im
glad
its
only
8pm
gives
me
plenty
of
time
to
finish
it
off
or
it
finish
me
off
lacerative
is
quite
right
nice
freshly
consumed
about
two
weeks
after
the
release
date
furious
burning
hops
and
a
hefty
alcohol
presence
burns
going
down
until
the
last
third
of
the
bottle
after
it
calms
down
not
really
a
hugh
bitter
aftertaste
though
which
is
odd
almost
has
a
cherry
cough
syruplike
taste
needs
at
least
a
year
in
the
cellar
for
me
still
good
ol
stone
though
db
is
big
bold
immensely
satisfying
and
all
the
other
things
youd
expect
from
stone
praise
be
to
the
bastard
d
for
the
style
it
is
an
excellent
example
but
one
of
these
a
night
is
enough
for
me
poured
a
deep
orangeamber
and
smelled
of
sweettart
grapefruit
truly
double
the
arrogance
very
hoppy
to
start
then
the
hopcaramelcitrus
tastes
settles
in
with
a
clean
slightly
sweet
finish
i
would
never
guess
the
abv
without
checking
the
bottle
this
really
knocked
my
socks
off
this
is
a
good
beer
but
it
truly
is
an
assault
on
the
taste
buds
just
a
very
strong
dark
alcoholic
ale
a
very
tasty
smooth
and
enriching
experience
at
the
time
of
consumption
i
assumed
i
was
drinking
a
barleywine
although
the
style
doesnt
really
matter
all
that
much
this
is
a
very
good
beer
hoppy
and
strong
enjoed
with
a
friend
from
a
bomber
into
oversized
wine
glasses
where
the
beer
was
allowed
to
breath
and
let
loose
its
bonanza
of
different
fruity
and
hoppy
scents
a
strong
and
alcoholic
brew
every
part
of
this
beer
is
extreme
finishing
with
mouth
watering
hops
creamy
mouthfeel
i
wonder
if
the
glassware
had
any
part
in
it
it
is
a
big
beer
and
to
both
of
us
this
was
the
equivalent
of
knockout
gas
drinkability
very
good
moderation
is
key
the
beer
is
not
so
much
arrogant
but
very
very
drinkable
a
fine
stone
offering
indeed
that
i
wont
shy
away
from
in
the
future
but
will
seek
out
annually
indeed
drinkability
this
one
didnt
really
sit
well
on
my
palate
but
itll
drink
this
fine
ale
pours
a
nice
dark
copper
color
the
head
is
slightly
offwhite
nearing
a
tan
and
it
does
not
last
long
the
olfactory
apparatus
first
is
knocked
back
by
the
alcohol
contained
within
subsequent
sniffs
are
not
as
neck
snapping
with
malty
and
hoppy
scents
coming
through
dont
be
offput
initiallyjust
brace
yourself
for
an
experience
the
taste
is
sweet
and
bitter
at
the
same
time
there
is
a
wonderful
thicknees
to
the
aftertaste
damnation
this
is
not
to
be
avoided
do
not
cellar
this
drink
immediately
and
then
run
out
the
next
day
and
buy
a
few
more
if
you
have
passed
this
up
you
are
a
fool
enjoy
the
beer
came
out
the
traditional
color
of
barleywine
which
to
me
is
burgundy
with
a
touch
of
orange
the
first
pour
was
clear
and
had
a
one
finger
thick
head
with
remarkable
staying
power
carbonation
in
the
underlying
beer
was
gentle
looking
but
steady
the
aroma
was
multilayered
malts
with
vanilla
hazelnut
toffee
and
chocolate
not
many
hops
were
detectable
using
the
nose
the
taste
was
amazingly
complex
as
well
flavors
of
chocolate
oak
black
pepper
raisins
and
mandarin
orange
were
found
in
each
sip
the
mouthfeel
however
was
a
little
pricklier
than
i
remembered
radiating
warmth
was
felt
in
the
belly
letting
the
alcoholic
strength
numb
away
all
angst
about
letting
this
sit
in
a
warmer
than
recommended
cellaring
closet
i
can
see
this
one
going
a
few
more
years
along
the
ascending
path
unfortunately
no
more
bottles
are
left
in
the
cellar
to
test
the
theory
time
for
a
chattanooga
beer
run
soon
i
think
a
wonderful
experience
all
around
very
easy
to
drink
and
almost
get
lost
in
but
at
10
probably
only
good
for
one
in
a
session
appearance
is
like
a
penny
that
is
3
years
old
there
is
a
nice
slight
tan
had
with
great
lacing
which
is
a
good
characteristic
of
most
stone
brews
the
smell
is
very
molasseybrown
sugarry
the
hops
are
also
very
present
the
taste
is
incredible
notes
of
caramel
raisins
pine
and
hints
of
citrus
man
i
love
the
sweetness
of
this
brew
alcohol
ios
present
but
not
scary
very
drinkable
if
it
werent
for
the
higher
abv
on
this
i
would
love
to
sit
around
and
just
sip
this
bad
boy
all
night
this
is
one
delicious
and
hardhitting
beer
its
greatest
strength
is
its
range
of
flavors
that
are
in
addition
to
the
very
deep
hoppiness
that
seem
to
characterize
all
of
stones
brews
i
get
the
flavors
of
caramel
grapefruit
molasses
alcohol
and
even
chocolate
it
is
just
a
wonderfully
intense
and
delicous
brew
the
one
criticism
and
this
is
in
the
context
of
it
being
one
of
my
favorite
american
beers
is
that
while
each
sip
indivually
goes
down
very
smoothly
it
is
difficult
to
keep
drinking
this
for
a
while
i
guess
that
this
is
for
the
better
for
a
10
abv
beer
pours
a
clear
mediumdark
copper
with
a
small
offwhite
creamy
slowly
diminishing
head
the
smell
surprisingly
mild
and
sweet
well
its
not
really
mild
but
i
was
expecting
an
arrogant
bastard
on
steroids
but
smells
like
they
didnt
go
for
a
ridiculously
big
beer
like
many
brewers
tend
to
do
wonderful
aromas
of
fruity
and
piney
hops
and
smooth
roasted
malts
the
taste
is
oh
wow
its
big
and
delicious
huge
flavors
of
piney
hops
and
caramel
malts
but
what
sets
apart
from
the
other
and
makes
it
superior
is
the
excellent
balance
it
has
a
full
body
oily
slightly
syrupy
texture
and
soft
carbonation
perfect
mouthfeel
for
the
bigbeer
experience
this
beer
goes
down
wickedly
easy
for
as
strong
as
it
is
its
liquid
crack
i
really
want
to
go
back
to
zenos
soon
to
try
the
other
stone
beers
they
have
on
tap
while
they
last
but
im
not
sure
how
ill
be
able
to
pick
anything
over
the
db
i
need
a
fix
must
have
more
double
bastard
a
dark
reddish
brown
color
off
creamy
head
form
the
head
laces
very
well
a
incredible
aroma
of
hops
comes
through
with
citrus
and
earthy
scents
the
taste
is
intense
some
malt
comes
in
right
at
the
beginning
then
the
hops
begin
their
assault
on
your
taste
buds
the
hops
come
through
predominantly
the
citrus
flavors
come
through
in
the
mouth
it
is
heavy
and
rich
slightly
chewy
but
coats
the
mouth
wondefully
this
beer
is
much
like
the
other
bastard
agressive
the
tatste
is
very
intense
and
would
be
be
defined
as
a
big
beer
d
very
drinkable
given
the
alcohol
and
hops
whoa
first
taste
blew
me
away
although
ive
always
heard
great
things
about
this
ale
appearance
is
a
reddish
brown
color
with
a
beautifully
bubbly
head
that
lasts
the
whole
time
a
nice
amount
of
lacing
also
the
nose
is
very
sweet
and
the
taste
is
nicely
hoppy
although
not
overly
so
with
a
gorgeous
malty
aftertaste
it
has
a
heavy
feel
very
satisfying
an
excellent
beer
will
definately
buy
again
and
will
most
definately
recommend
to
friends
i
was
told
this
brew
would
turn
me
around
regarding
stone
instead
it
has
done
to
opposite
if
i
had
to
choose
between
this
beer
and
bmc
id
say
that
bmc
lite
ice
wins
utterly
unpleasant
totally
unbalanced
drinkability
is
not
good
this
tastes
like
dirty
feet
this
is
some
nasty
cloying
grit
peppered
waste
i
thought
this
was
the
new
one
i
am
overly
curious
to
try
one
of
these
in
an
uncellared
fresh
state
but
i
am
almost
affraid
to
its
amazing
what
age
has
done
to
this
brew
a
few
months
ago
i
had
a
fresh
bottle
that
was
chaotic
and
brash
with
2
plus
years
in
the
bottle
this
has
mellowed
into
an
incredible
barley
wine
fresh
its
a
conundrum
with
some
age
the
balance
pulls
through
the
hops
mellow
and
the
complexity
and
drinkability
rise
dramatically
its
a
good
drink
occasionally
fresh
but
aged
this
awesome
juice
is
a
must
have
as
someone
who
is
a
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
arrogant
bastard
this
is
one
very
nice
surprise
getting
the
alcohol
a
little
higher
means
a
little
more
malt
and
it
balances
out
the
hop
profile
very
well
a
bold
but
balanced
brew
a
great
beer
and
worthy
of
such
a
high
rating
but
the
black
sheep
of
the
family
arrogant
bastard
and
not
double
bastard
should
hold
the
title
of
most
arrogant
between
the
two
poured
from
a
22oz
bomber
marked
2005
release
into
a
pint
glass
i
loved
the
warning
and
paragraph
denouncing
pedestrian
products
and
on
the
bottles
backside
pours
a
crystal
clear
beautiful
dark
cherry
color
with
full
finger
foamy
off
white
head
that
slowly
gave
way
to
moderate
lacing
looks
absolutely
incredible
very
impressive
and
pleasing
to
the
eye
aroma
is
rich
with
a
mixture
of
a
malty
sweetness
accompanied
by
a
nose
stinging
burn
of
alcohol
which
is
nicely
complemented
by
well
balanced
hops
taste
is
complex
yet
to
the
point
with
the
everpresence
of
unhidden
alcohol
ive
had
many
beers
in
the
910
abv
range
and
none
have
been
this
bold
in
that
respect
not
to
the
point
of
being
overpowering
simply
a
somewhat
constant
reminder
of
its
presence
flavors
of
caramel
malt
and
evergreenpine
hops
take
the
lead
with
undertones
of
dried
fruitlike
sweetness
that
blends
well
with
the
complexity
of
this
brew
mouthfeel
is
medium
in
body
passes
quickly
and
leaves
a
slick
coat
in
the
mouth
carbonation
fairly
minimal
matches
well
with
the
complex
characteristics
of
this
beer
drinkability
high
for
the
smooth
easy
yet
aggressive
stature
of
this
ale
takes
a
slight
hit
for
higher
abv
wouldnt
want
to
drunken
the
palate
and
waste
any
of
this
incredible
brew
will
definitely
seek
out
again
in
the
future
a
phenomenal
beer
im
gonna
have
to
get
my
hands
on
some
more
of
these
clear
reddish
copper
color
with
about
a
finger
of
offwhite
head
really
great
aroma
caramel
and
toffee
stand
out
the
most
but
theres
also
a
good
amout
of
chocolate
and
brown
sugar
nice
piney
hop
aroma
too
really
sweet
with
a
strong
bitter
finish
amazingly
flavorful
reflecting
all
the
aroma
and
some
fruit
as
well
medium
bodied
and
well
carbonated
the
alcohol
is
hidden
well
but
it
can
catch
up
to
you
in
a
hurry
very
drinkable
for
a
brew
of
this
abv
but
still
like
its
little
brother
a
bit
too
in
your
face
for
alot
of
drinking
nonethless
quite
a
beautiful
brew
yum
and
i
thought
that
arrogant
bastard
was
good
pours
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
2
inch
head
the
dissappears
to
film
after
some
time
taste
is
loaded
with
hops
flavor
yet
still
balanced
out
with
great
malt
flavor
drinking
is
followed
by
a
warming
sensation
most
likley
from
the
10
alc
several
flavors
going
on
in
this
brew
blending
very
well
but
its
hard
to
pick
them
out
ill
look
for
this
brew
again
this
beer
poured
a
glowing
dark
cherry
red
with
a
thin
off
white
head
smelled
of
raspberries
rhubarb
a
woody
vanilla
some
oats
and
a
nip
of
hops
with
just
a
touch
of
alcohol
tasted
of
sweet
mellow
fruits
like
cherries
plumbs
and
raisins
and
caramelized
sugar
malts
with
a
crisp
piney
hop
that
dragged
on
into
a
pungently
dry
finish
theres
a
fantastic
blend
of
sweet
and
dry
in
this
beer
the
mouth
feel
was
medium
bodied
with
a
light
carbonation
this
is
a
very
tasty
and
unique
beer
the
flavor
was
very
malty
sticky
with
toffee
carmelized
sugar
hopsack
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
but
im
a
little
surprised
about
the
high
ratings
basically
this
seems
like
a
very
good
big
american
strong
alebarleywine
i
had
heard
a
lot
about
this
beer
but
i
was
a
little
let
down
the
alcohol
and
malty
sweetness
combined
with
the
huge
amount
of
ibus
is
almost
a
little
cloying
when
a
beer
is
this
big
i
start
wondering
about
what
flaws
the
supermalt
and
hops
content
is
covering
up
thanks
to
karengarys
for
finding
this
brew
for
me
this
beer
poured
a
dark
garnet
color
with
a
nice
fluffy
head
nose
is
of
sweet
malts
dark
fruits
and
alcohol
taste
is
of
dark
fruits
candied
sugar
sweet
malts
and
an
alcohol
warming
finish
mouthfeel
is
smooth
creamy
and
full
overall
drinkability
is
pretty
good
but
this
is
the
only
one
you
want
to
enjoy
unless
you
plan
on
getting
faced
the
smoke
in
the
air
rendered
any
sniff
test
useless
but
i
was
impressed
by
the
beers
dark
dark
red
appearance
it
would
perhaps
be
most
instructive
to
compare
this
to
the
now
ubiquitous
arrogant
bastard
i
noticed
more
of
a
berry
flavour
than
with
ab
and
despite
the
presence
of
a
disturbing
amount
of
alcohol
it
seemed
a
little
smoother
and
just
as
drinkable
the
impression
i
gained
was
less
roughage
more
alcohol
however
the
alcohol
was
not
so
apparent
that
it
ruined
the
beer
which
was
extremely
easy
to
drain
fortunately
i
realised
how
hammered
20
fluid
ounces
had
made
me
and
didnt
risk
any
more
this
is
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
for
what
this
beer
is
its
nice
and
drinkable
at
least
in
the
sense
that
drinking
one
is
great
fun
and
the
one
i
drank
was
about
8oz
more
than
that
would
put
you
on
your
ass
enjoy
this
was
an
excellent
beer
and
suprisingly
drinkable
but
not
a
5
for
obvious
reasonsabv
will
make
you
blotto
and
no
one
can
appreciate
this
beer
while
three
sheets
to
the
wind
overall
not
dispapointed
stone
ontinues
to
be
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
in
the
us
as
i
drank
this
over
2
hours
not
25
minutes
like
the
previous
reviewer
all
i
could
think
about
was
how
rich
and
complex
this
baby
is
fresh
the
hops
are
very
strong
and
powerful
but
this
year
old
version
has
mellowed
out
to
where
the
rich
thick
creamy
malts
are
the
dominant
character
i
am
not
a
drinker
of
whiskeys
or
whiskys
but
this
reminded
me
of
the
smoky
rich
full
malts
of
a
late
nightcap
the
alcohol
is
definitely
there
but
not
in
a
bad
way
lots
of
vanilla
and
woody
notes
what
can
i
say
this
stuff
is
very
good
dark
brown
with
some
reddishcopper
hues
a
fairly
modest
head
which
is
too
oily
to
leave
much
in
its
wake
aroma
taste
are
huge
caramel
malt
with
an
earthy
malt
sweetness
complexity
that
is
second
to
none
the
big
hops
are
buried
under
layers
upon
layers
of
malt
complexity
to
be
honest
i
think
this
could
use
a
lot
more
hop
character
to
balance
it
out
as
the
malts
may
be
as
big
as
any
beer
ive
sampled
the
alcohol
is
fairly
obvious
but
it
blends
in
fairly
well
with
the
multitude
of
flavors
this
bad
ass
brew
throws
at
you
a
very
big
bold
offering
from
stone
this
is
one
powerful
beverage
it
seems
to
get
better
as
you
drink
it
more
hops
and
more
complexity
spicy
hoppy
thick
did
i
mention
complex
definately
a
sipping
brew
pretty
much
as
stone
describes
it
excessive
excessiveness
id
like
to
cellar
some
of
these
if
i
had
a
cellar
awesome
i
will
double
the
bastard
bastard
the
double
as
it
says
on
the
05
release
i
think
that
probably
ultimately
means
drink
more
of
this
ultra
complex
tasty
treat
absolutely
incredible
that
this
biggun
has
such
wonderful
drinkability
after
enjoying
my
first
fresh
bomber
of
the
2005
i
was
hoping
to
cellar
the
other
two
alas
its
just
so
tasty
and
drinkable
that
i
couldnt
resist
making
trips
to
the
cellar
to
drink
the
other
two
bottles
over
a
two
week
period
very
much
like
an
arrogant
bastard
on
steroids
highly
recommended
appeared
a
deep
copper
color
with
extra
long
lasting
lacing
and
head
initially
smelled
of
orange
peel
and
pineapple
but
these
scents
faded
in
proportion
to
the
amount
that
i
drank
taste
was
excellent
with
the
right
balance
of
hops
and
malts
as
the
beer
warmed
the
hops
became
secondary
and
a
bocklike
malt
flavor
emerged
mouthfeel
was
nice
with
a
sweet
taste
in
the
front
which
was
quickly
followed
by
a
bitter
hop
finish
easily
drinkable
but
not
as
available
from
my
local
purveyors
as
i
would
like
ill
drink
it
when
i
can
find
this
sturdy
offering
from
stone
brewing
co
pours
a
dark
amber
color
not
much
carbonation
small
head
some
lacing
not
much
of
a
scent
but
could
notice
some
sweet
hopsmalt
nice
taste
of
hoppy
malts
and
a
sweet
aftertaste
could
tell
there
is
a
high
alcohol
content
medium
body
drinkable
another
nice
brew
from
stone
another
fine
brew
by
stone
i
liked
this
much
better
than
arrogant
bastard
i
found
it
to
be
much
better
balanced
still
a
motherfucker
of
a
beer
but
not
something
that
i
need
to
go
whoa
after
every
sip
drinkability
there
is
a
reason
why
they
dont
sell
this
in
sixpacks
it
is
far
to
quaffable
thick
rich
darkness
enters
the
mouth
on
first
sip
long
burnt
malt
is
even
and
well
spread
out
palate
is
blessed
with
spicey
dark
fruit
so
well
mingled
with
the
malt
amazing
balance
mouthfell
is
a
begging
for
the
next
drink
taste
buds
electric
from
slight
hop
notes
mouth
watering
for
more
you
hope
you
never
see
the
bottom
of
the
glass
another
unique
arogant
double
huge
success
from
stone
yum
an
excellent
kick
butt
ale
strong
but
not
overwheming
kind
of
thicksyrupy
but
that
is
good
and
double
bastard
passes
the
test
as
to
its
worthiness
to
accompany
a
good
afternoon
of
tv
football
this
is
definitly
worth
the
expense
to
give
it
a
try
although
its
not
that
easy
to
find
i
got
mine
at
whole
foods
at
first
this
tasted
too
sweet
to
me
but
i
think
its
actually
quite
artfully
balanced
the
malts
are
just
more
prominent
in
this
gigantic
beer
its
a
superior
drinking
experience
fresh
but
im
gonna
lock
my
other
bottle
away
for
a
year
to
see
if
this
will
meld
change
become
creamier
something
okay
im
going
on
record
as
one
of
the
few
hopheads
who
craves
overthetop
bitterness
and
laughs
at
a
need
for
balance
to
not
fall
in
love
with
this
beer
its
very
good
but
a
rough
medicinal
malt
profile
ruins
it
for
anything
that
would
make
this
exceptional
it
looks
good
deep
dark
brick
red
good
size
head
for
the
high
abv
pine
floral
and
grapefruit
hops
in
front
of
caramel
and
toffee
malts
make
up
the
aroma
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
full
bodied
good
carbonation
and
its
a
lot
easier
to
drink
then
it
should
be
you
get
what
you
smell
in
the
taste
with
the
addition
of
the
unfortunate
medicinal
flavor
the
keeps
this
from
being
an
amazing
brew
overall
this
ones
not
bad
but
i
still
feel
the
alcohol
is
a
bit
too
inyourface
to
warrant
really
high
marks
i
dont
know
if
ill
try
it
again
but
i
love
supporting
stones
other
brews
well
this
is
certainly
an
incredible
beer
stone
isnt
afraid
of
offending
you
with
their
stuff
thank
goodness
im
not
easily
offended
huge
malt
hops
alcohol
fruit
everything
i
love
it
this
has
got
to
be
one
of
my
3
favorite
beers
huge
malts
big
hops
and
a
nice
alcohol
bite
if
its
available
in
your
area
i
would
highly
recommend
stockpiling
as
much
as
you
can
afford
drinkability
i
could
drink
this
all
night
long
however
since
it
is
10
abv
i
would
not
remember
drinking
it
the
next
day
with
that
said
34
and
id
be
set
mouthfeel
drinkability
this
beer
is
the
mother
of
all
full
bodied
beers
i
tried
this
beer
almost
six
months
ago
and
hated
it
this
is
not
the
beer
for
a
hop
lover
to
bust
a
cherry
on
wow
what
a
powerful
brew
despite
the
punch
it
packs
its
still
somehow
very
smooth
and
quite
delicious
not
to
mention
complex
even
the
color
is
multifaceted
man
though
im
worn
out
and
i
havent
even
finished
twothirds
of
the
bottle
highly
highly
recommended
fresh
2005
release
pours
a
half
finger
tan
head
over
a
mildly
cloudy
brownrustcopper
liquid
smells
lemony
hops
with
supporting
undertones
of
grapefruit
pith
and
tangerine
some
caramel
malt
sweet
and
way
beneath
is
alcohol
taste
is
potent

make
the
malt
seem
like
soured
caramel
hops
are
cohumulone
rough
and
bitterness
is
high
the
hop
flavor
is
woody
and
dry
oranges
pine
and
pith
malt
is
way
beneath
and
comes
across
as
powery
caramel
with
a
hint
of
nutty
that
borders
on
chocolate
the
aftertaste
is
cottony
with
an
alcoholic
umph
that
further
denegrates
the
malt
flavor
with
searching
i
find
an
ester
array
but
i
cant
identify
specifics
under
the
brutality
of
the
hops
as
i
drink
further
the
alcohol
stands
out
much
stronger
and
is
really
wearing
the
hops
are
wearing
this
beer
is
not
enjoyable
yes
i
can
see
this
beer
as
properly
being
classified
as
an
asa
it
definitely
needs
aging
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
thick
a
nice
feature
that
is
hard
to
concentrate
on
under
the
hops
and
alcohol
which
are
now
coming
across
as
cheap
vodka
poured
into
my
beer
ive
got
a
bottle
of
2004
in
my
cellar
and
based
on
my
experience
tonight
i
wont
open
it
for
another
couple
years
gorgeous
beer
with
tones
ranging
from
burnt
orange
to
burgundy
as
the
light
hits
it
modest
head
and
retention
leaving
a
fuzzy
ring
and
a
splattering
of
bubbles
on
the
surface
with
minimal
carbonation
activity
smells
citrusfruity
delightful
with
detectable
alcohol
underlying
which
cleans
the
sinuses
taste
to
me
is
just
about
perfect
smooth
for
a
10
percenter
but
still
with
enough
alcohol
spiciness
to
remind
you
of
what
you
are
dealing
with
extremely
complex
in
flavor
every
sip
you
detect
something
else
citrusy
and
spicy
in
the
beginning
but
as
it
warmed
and
me
the
malts
really
started
to
shine
leaving
a
lip
smacking
sweetness
for
an
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
on
the
syruppy
side
and
drinkability
is
somewhat
low
due
to
the
high
abv
and
pricetag
5
bucks
for
a
22oz
bomber
this
is
my
first
taste
of
fresh
db
in
a
couple
of
years
i
liked
the
9
month
old
04
i
last
had
a
little
better
cherrylike
fruits
toasted
malt
and
piney
hops
mouthfeel
is
thinner
than
expected
drinkability
is
okay
the
rich
flavor
and
lack
of
availability
prevent
me
from
having
another
one
tonight
this
pairs
well
with
trader
joes
cave
aged
gorgonzola
hops
are
the
driving
force
and
the
profile
is
so
amazingly
put
together
that
it
is
actually
a
very
smooth
and
drinkable
beer
rich
and
sweet
to
the
point
of
being
candied
light
citrusy
fruits
splash
around
followed
by
the
alcohol
burst
and
of
course
all
this
time
it
can
not
escape
the
hop
crunch
toasted
bread
as
well
could
this
beer
be
any
more
well
rounded
awesome
stone
continues
to
hit
home
runs
with
me
alcohol
isnt
that
noticable
really
a
flavor
adventure
every
sip
a
beer
to
be
cherished
beer
is
good
happy
cellared
strong
bering
rich
full
bodied
with
a
subdued
carbonation
this
is
a
delicious
ale
that
will
keep
me
coming
back
for
more
and
more
i
didnt
much
care
for
double
bastard
but
then
i
tried
the
05
release
double
bastard
is
an
amazing
strong
ale
it
is
a
dark
red
the
smell
is
of
carmel
and
hops
it
tastes
like
hemoglobin
and
carmel
it
doesnt
taste
like
alcohol
even
though
the
abv
is
high
the
high
abv
keeps
it
from
being
exceptionally
drinkable
but
the
taste
is
great
if
it
had
about
half
the
alcohol
that
it
has
it
would
be
straight
5s
notes
man
i
have
been
privy
to
some
great
beers
as
of
late
and
this
one
is
one
of
the
best
you
simply
must
pick
up
a
bottle
of
this
and
share
it
with
some
friends
dangerously
drinkable
i
highly
recommend
this
one
this
beer
pours
a
golden
brown
with
a
slight
red
tint
the
light
brown
head
fades
slowly
leaving
a
good
amount
of
laces
this
beer
has
a
good
hoppy
aroma
it
smells
very
sweet
and
malty
also
the
alcohol
content
is
noticable
in
the
aroma
it
has
a
slight
citrus
aroma
also
this
beer
tastes
quite
sweet
the
alcohol
warms
as
it
goes
down
it
is
not
as
hoppy
as
the
aroma
leads
you
to
think
but
it
is
still
hoppy
this
beer
has
a
citrus
flavor
also
the
flavor
is
quite
aggressive
it
has
a
very
slight
piney
taste
also
this
beer
is
thick
it
goes
down
surprisingly
smooth
leaving
an
aggressive
sweet
malty
aftertaste
this
beer
is
carbonated
well
i
think
it
would
not
make
a
good
session
beer
because
it
is
high
in
alcohol
and
it
is
very
aggressive
i
think
it
is
a
good
beer
but
not
one
i
would
want
to
drink
all
the
time
this
brew
cannot
be
touched
this
was
a
good
buy
try
it
awesome
beer
i
paired
it
up
with
some
monterey
jack
with
jalapeno
cheese
and
it
worked
together
beautifully
this
beer
is
no
joke
at
10
0
abv
enjoy
its
complexity
and
respect
the
powerful
profile
recommended
all
in
all
a
beer
i
can
now
say
i
love
unfortunately
its
pretty
tough
to
get
in
seattle
this
year
the
distributor
only
got
25
what
they
got
last
year
so
i
wont
be
drinking
much
in
fact
i
was
only
able
to
order
one
3liter
bottle
for
my
store
no
22s
overall
a
longtime
favorite
that
i
have
neglected
for
too
long
double
bastard
is
the
highlight
beer
of
a
great
brewery
that
all
americans
and
beerlovers
the
world
round
should
be
proud
of
and
those
hops
yeah
double
your
pleasure
double
your
bastard
like
biting
into
a
live
wire
highvoltage
shocks
of
alcohol
and
hop
cones
doesnt
have
the
addictibility
of
bigfoot
et
al
but
will
sure
put
an
end
to
your
insomnia
drinkability
notes

tasty
beer
could
have
used
a
few
more
months
but
good
as
is
the
last
time
i
had
this
beer
i
was
still
early
in
the
craft
beer
life
i
found
13
of
a
bottle
nearly
undrinkable
judging
from
my
opinion
tonight
either
i
or
the
beer
have
come
quite
a
long
way
am
i
the
only
one
who
wants
to
see
oaked
double
bastard
that
would
be
excellent
but
geez
its
worth
it
i
bought
two
bombers
and
im
definitely
buying
more
before
its
gone
for
this
year
cheers
well
im
glad
i
had
a
bottle
but
that
jubale
in
my
fridge
is
actually
sounding
more
fun
than
the
rest
of
this
bottle
i
know
that
this
beer
has
been
changed
in
ba
from
a
double
ipa
to
an
american
barleywine
to
an
american
strong
ale
id
like
to
say
in
my
mind
its
almost
a
winter
warmer
yes
strong
enough
to
be
a
barleywine
but
i
could
see
packing
a
bottle
of
this
stuff
on
a
backpacking
trip
pours
a
deep
dark
red
and
makes
a
thin
offwhite
head
leaves
a
very
slight
lacing
that
eases
its
way
down
my
glass
and
leaves
a
syrupy
residue
on
the
sides
aroma
of
caramelized
brown
sugar
pine
and
a
hint
of
citrus
flavor
has
notes
of
caramel
sweet
brown
sugar
strong
pepper
spice
strong
bittering
hoppy
character
opens
full
bodied
with
a
thick
sweet
palate
finishes
slightly
dry
nicely
done
this
first
bomber
went
down
way
too
easy
i
would
get
another
but
call
me
well
done
perhaps
im
not
worthy
with
the
alcohol
at
10abv
this
one
should
lay
down
for
a
few
years
and
come
out
nicely
very
dark
red
cakey
tan
foam
head
quickly
diminishing
probably
due
to
the
high
alcohol
content
many
different
smells
floral
hops
and
dominating
malt
flavor
bites
you
with
the
malt
and
hops
and
astrenginceyspelling
too
bad
this
only
comes
around
every
so
often
to
my
town
they
always
have
arrogant
but
not
the
double
next
time
they
come
in
i
will
buy
about
a
dozen
of
them
good
beer
i
once
had
a
pair
of
oxblood
doc
martins
this
beer
is
the
color
my
shoes
should
have
been
excellent
deep
redbrown
with
a
cream
head
once
i
drank
it
down
a
bit
i
gave
it
a
good
swirl
and
it
were
a
scotch
youd
say
it
had
long
legs
understated
bouquet
of
mild
potpourri
all
modesty
is
thrown
out
the
window
with
the
first
sip
starts
with
a
caramelcondensed
sweetness
followed
by
aggressive
piney
hops
with
coconut
notes
finishes
deep
and
long
retuning
to
the
creaminess
reveled
first
defiantly
a
good
brew
to
let
get
warm
as
different
temps
reveal
additional
dimensions
to
the
flavor
very
soft
and
viscous
easily
palatable
yet
with
strong
character
remarkable
unalcoholic
in
the
mouth
your
head
feels
it
and
refreshing
without
being
overly
moist
this
is
awesome
but
some
abv
is
evident
and
youll
be
able
to
tell
appearance
is
ok
pours
a
beautiful
mahogany
with
no
head
after
a
minute
smell
is
a
little
underwhelming
maple
syrup
some
citrus
fruit
and
pine
needles
are
all
there
in
small
quantities
but
the
alcohol
makes
a
bit
too
much
of
an
appearance
in
my
opinion
its
also
got
an
unpleasant
oxidized
smell
taste
is
interesting
but
not
up
to
some
of
the
better
barleywines
ive
had
everything
in
the
smell
makes
an
appearance
though
i
cant
taste
the
wet
paper
oxidized
smell
at
least
here
i
can
say
that
if
the
alcohol
was
not
so
apparent
this
would
be
a
great
beer
malt
and
hops
are
very
well
balanced
there
is
a
nice
piney
aftertaste
and
a
nice
deep
sweet
fruity
taste
but
after
that
the
alcohol
overwhelms
you
and
the
aftertaste
leaves
you
thinking
you
just
took
a
tiny
shot
of
some
cheap
rum
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
very
smooth
and
medium
bodied
for
a
barleywine
drinkability
suffers
due
to
the
alcohol
but
still
isnt
bad
just
doesnt
have
enough
flavor
to
mask
the
alcohol
in
my
opinion
this
is
exactly
why
i
recently
changed
my
favorite
style
from
american

theres
so
much
better

itself
doesnt

with

one
has

something
that
needs
to
be
respected

a

beer
to

would
not

more
than

it
took
me
a

to
studying
the

had
a

beer
is
just
great
i
picked
a
great
one
for
a
sunday
night
sipper
while
i
will
sing
this
beers
praises
up
and
down
its
meaty
beaty
big
and
bouncy
delivering
on
a
reputation
thats
obviously
wellearned
its
all
i
hoped
for
and
more
because
of
the
hugeness
the
balance
seems
precarious
but
it
never
falters
like
the
rest
of
the
beer
the
abv
is
big
too
and
it
will
smack
you
down
if
you
let
it
still
id
drink
as
many
more
of
these
as
i
could
until
i
fell
down
but
im
sure
id
be
sorry
come
morning
i
just
wish
every
bastard
i
knew
was
as
fun
to
be
around
as
this
one
pours
a
deep
dark
hazy
ruby
with
an
agressive
sticky
tan
head
nice
webs
of
lacing
as
the
beer
recedes
aroma
is
sweet
with
noticeable
hops
and
a
light
medicinal
presence
thick
and
smooth
with
a
nice
malt
presence
in
the
beginning
of
each
sip
dark
cherries
with
hints
of
alcohol
followed
by
a
citrusy
hop
presence
which
dominates
the
finish
but
balances
out
the
beer
on
the
whole
there
is
a
slight
medicinal
aftertaste
which
lingers
a
little
longer
than
desired
drinkability
is
not
as
good
as
some
high
abv
beers
i
have
had
thanks
to
jeff
brewmesum
for
making
this
experience
possible
finally
able
to
snag
a
bottle
of
this
fabled
brew
at
jungle
jims
in
cincinnati
2003
edition
it
poured
an
amber
red
with
a
nice
cream
collar
i
was
expecting
a
huge
hop
profile
but
i
was
surprised
when
my
first
taste
had
more
malt
than
hops
the
hop
flavor
came
through
after
i
got
over
my
initial
shock
there
is
a
little
bit
of
alcohol
evident
which
becomes
more
pronounced
as
the
beer
warms
there
is
a
slight
oily
feeling
left
on
the
tongue
which
i
actually
enjoy
if
drinking
slowly
the
drinkability
is
amazingly
high
as
i
was
able
to
finish
off
2
bombers
of
this
in
one
nightover
about
3
hours
without
fatiguing
my
palate
i
love
this
beer
and
may
have
to
stock
so
i
can
enjoy
it
year
round

release
ive
been
sitting
on
this
for
a
few
months
now
and
settling
in
to
watch
boondock
saints
with
a
lovely
lady
seemed
the
right
time
to
pop
open
the
db
she
loves
hops
so
that
helped
a
bit
pours
a
deep
mahogany
very
sticky
beer
on
the
palate
in
the
glass
stickiness
is
the
nature
of
this
beast
candy
sweet
nose
plenty
of
hops
and
alcohol
as
well
alcohol
is
well
hidden
in
the
flavor
i
actually
expected
this
to
be
hoppier
than
it
was
dont
get
me
wrong
theres
a
shitload
of
hops
in
this
brew
but
the
maltiness
is
huge
very
roasty
moreso
than
its
younger
sibling
im
glad
that
malt
profile
is
so
big
it
balances
this
brew
out
so
well
resinous
wood
and
pine
notes
are
noticeable
as
well
loads
of
flavor
a
fantastic
beer
i
wouldnt
expect
anything
less
from
the
kids
at
stone
outstanding
beer
feels
like
a
bw
to
me
a
standout
the
flavor
is
malty
sweet
up
front
with
some
earth
and
piney
flavors
in
the
middle
and
finish
the
finish
is
also
a
little
dry
and
vinous
i
definitely
get
alcohol
warmth
on
the
way
to
my
belly
this
is
a
pretty
tasty
brew
and
fairly
easy
to
drink

that
regular
ab
i
picked
up
a
minty
flavor
when
swallowing
which
was
surprisingly
not
unpleasent
a
very
think
and
chunky
mouthfeel
a
nice
bwoa
style
beer
but
didnt
stand
out
as
anything
overly
special
its
highlights
surely
were
the
balance
and
drinkability
very
drinkable
beer
at
10
abv
this
would
be
difficult
to
consume
in
rapid
succession
this
beer
is
meant
to
be
savored
and
quaffed
slowly
enjoy
in
moderation
drinkability
is
good
this
beer
is
full
of
flavor
and
no
offflavors
drinks
well
and
the
22oz
isnt
too
much
thats
kind
of
surprising
considering
its
strength
maybe
the
challenge
on
the
label
works
poured
a
very
dark
amber
looked
almost
black
in
the
nonick
but
coppery
when
held
to
the
light
it
had
a
small
to
moderate
creamy
brown
head
that
soon
dissipated
into
a
thin
film
of
bubbles
the
aroma
was
thick
sweet
malt
the
taste
was
big
hints
of
chocolate
roast
and
a
smooth
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste

drench
the

in

complex
citric

alcohol
becomes
a

more

in
the

but
only
a
bit
the
double

goes
down
smooth
without

you

then
as

if

by
yourself
most
likely
be
sure
to

holy
wow
22oz
bomber
poured
into
a
tulipstyle
glass
it
pours
a
super
dark
reddishbrown
color
with
two
fingers
of
offwhite
head
with
good
retention
and
lots
of
lacing
the
smell
is
full
of
citrus
with
ripe
oranges
and
grapefruit
hops
also
make
their
presence
known
in
the
smell
the
overall
aroma
is
just
so
full
and
bold
the
taste
has
a
good
malt
beginning
that
is
a
little
sweet
then
the
taste
is
taken
over
by
floral
hops
and
rubyred
grapefruit
the
balance
of
this
brew
is
just
incredible
not
many
have
ever
been
this
balanced
the
mouthfeel
is
super
thick
and
heavy
like
wws
meets
maple
syrup
the
drinkability
is
the
best
ive
ever
seen
from

ale
this
strong
i
could
just
keep
drinking
and

totally


the

just
came
out

so
i
culled
one
out
of
the

box
before
tucking
it
away
its
tight
and
not
opened
up
yet
but
man
the
hops
are
raging
and
the
malts
are
in
full
effect
i
put
my
04s
away
for
two
years
but
i
think
this

will
be
best

a
bomber
the
longawaited
2003
version
of
double
bastard
poured
a
light
mahogany
hue
with
an
offwhite
head
that
yielded
little
head
retention
and
even
less
lacing
ability
nonetheless
an
enticingly
attractive
brew
that
screams
for
ones
attention
resinous
sappy
piney
hops
dominate
the
nose
while
the
lions
share
of
sweet
malt
appears
to
keep
the
hop
notes
in
check
grapefruity
piney
hops
smack
the
palate
around
at
first
though
as
the
beer
warms
a
sizeable
lightly
toasted
malt
profile
introduces
itself
expounding
lavishly
sweet
caramel
flavor
to
the
neardominant
flavors
that
the
members
of
the
lupulin
family
emit
fresh
pineapple
notes
linger
as
well
a
touch
of
alcohol
is
evident
on
the
finish
but
hardly
enough
to
be
overly
distinguishable
the
full
round
mouthfeel
is
viscous
oily
and
sappy
all
at
once
drinks
quite
well
for
a
beer
of
ten
percent
abv
but
the
effects
certainly
introduce
themselves
shortly
after
the
emptying
of
the
bomber
highly
drinkable
for
its
size
hedonistic
nectar
this
is
one
pretty
looking
brew
beautiful
nearly
clear
reddish
amber
with

thick
foamy

around

glass
powerful
malty
hoppy
aroma
and
super
fresh
can
also
detect
a
malt
graininess
and
slight
fruitiness
really
smooth
and
syrupy
mouthfeel
with
a
nice
kick
of
hops
at
the
end
yet
not
overly
bitter
chewy
and
resiny
that
sticks
to
your
mouth
like
peanut
butter
i
detect
pineapple
in
the
flavors
along
with
a
super
blend
of
hops
and
malt
this
is
one
fantastic
brew
i
would
almost
peg
it
for
an
imperial
ipa
because
it
has
similar
qualities
to
many
ive
sampled
as
im
pouring
out
the
last
remains
of
this
bomber
i
cant
help
but
liken
the
visual
to
pouring
maple
syrup
on
top
of
pancakes
it
looked
that
thick
as
it
streamed
out
to
the
last
drop
of
which
was
fantastic
the
huge
beer
in
front
of
me
was
a
sensory
journey
par
excellence
from
the
lovely
creamcrowned
rusty
amber
body
to
the
nose
of
multithemed
beer
ingredients
to
the
overwelming
tastiness
this
was
a
journey
to
remember
the
beer
is
so
complex
with
its
huge
malt
backbone
to
its
overhopped
balancing
act
the
waves
of
taste
and
aroma
come
as
an
onslaught
to
the
senses
heavy
in
alcohol
and
warming
of
the
innards
the
barleywinelike
body
pushes
the
limit
surely
not
a
multibeer
brew
this
is
to
be
savored
for
what
it
is
a
once
a
year
revelry
of
the
brewers
art
it
feels
strong
sticky
and
overbearing
the
carbonation
is
all
business
and
never
relaxes
strong
until
the
final
sip
a
real
bastard
this
is
for
the
beer
drinker
who
likes
to
push
the
limits
like
me
my
palate
having
been
invaded
and
maybe
even
violated
knows
no
resistence
and
wants
more
of
this
ale
a
brown
head
that
as
you
pour
starts
deceptively
small
and
then
blossoms
in
my
tulip
duvel
glass
to
about
3
inches
7
62
cm
for
the
nonamericans
thick
a
hazy
amber
color
with
beautiful
garnet
notes
when
held
up
to
the
light
a
malty
hoppy
aroma
evokes
the
thought
of
a
sticky
sweet
hop
smell
surprisingly
very
malty
was
my
first
thought
upon
tasting
this
beer
the
hops
are
there
but
not
over
the
top
and
in
your
face
this
is
a
thick
bodied
beer
that
seems
to
leave
a
coating
film
even
after
i
have
swallowed
definitely
hoppy
the
more
i
sip
the
more
i
can
detect
the
bitter
finish
in
this
beer
a
syrupy
hop
flavor
hits
your
tongue
at
first
and
then
finishes
with
a
drying
bitterness

mouthfeel
and
drinkability
wow
a
fabulous
beer
luxurious
brash
elegant
and
definately
arrogant
too
bad
this
is
a
limited
release
because
i
could
see
myself
enjoying
this
one
quite
often
i
spent
an
entire
afternoon
with
this
beer
following
its
journey
from
cold
to
warm
and
loving
every
step
ruby
color
with
a
hint
of
orange
and
a
mediocre
head
this
beer
is
heavy
on
the
hops
in
both
the
smell
and
taste
significant
malt
sweetness
but
somewhat
overshadowed
by
the
hops
there
is
an
initial
explosion
of
caramel
with
a
hint
of
cookie
dough
before
being
slapped
across
the
face
by
tremendous
hoppiness
maybe
a
year
or
two
of
aging
could
smooth
and
balance
this
beer
the
alcohol
in
this
beer
is
not
over
done
and
in
fact
fits
nicely
with
the
beer
i
didnt
think
it
was
possible
to
improve
on
a
classic
like
arrogant
bastard
but
apparently
i
was
wrong
despite
the
100
ibus
and
10
abv
the
beer
somehow
manages
to
remain
wellbalanced
and
a
true
treat
for
the
coming
cold
season
and
for
those
in
san
diego
the
chilly
70
degree
season
a
truly
great
beer
and
one
that
i
imagine
ill
be
waiting
for
every
year
drinkability
is
fairly
good
for
such
a
strong
brew
not
too
much
to
keep
me
from
finishing
the
bomber
but
much
too
strong
to
open
another
one
dark
honey
colored
with
a
haze
that
makes
it
look
thick
enough
to
spread
like
butter
an
orangey
beige
head
tops
it
off
but
disappears
quickly
aroma
is
light
but
smells
fruity
and
sweet
with
alcohol
vapors
rushing
upward
do
not
pour
near
open
flame
flavor
is
sweet
and
big
and
rich
some
sweet
malt
and
honey
hints
of
pear
finished
with
an
alcohol
tingle
and
burning
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
and
throat
very
warming
and
chewy
flavor
i
like
this
beer
but
it
tries
too
hard
clear
deep
garnet
hue
covered
by
a
light
beige
dogged
dense
head
that
yields
exiguous
lace
the
aroma
is
comprised
of
a
dominant
buttery
toffee
and
nutty
carob
combination
contrasted
by
a
balmy
smoky
pine
wood
and
herb
laced
citrus
hop
nose
swirling
releases
heaty
ethanol
and
subtle
fruitiness
of
a
bourbon
soaked
fig
character
surprisingly
well
rounded
and
understated
in
aroma
but
certainly
ominously
appetizing
transient
wash
of
burnt
caramel
sweetness
incipient
in
flavor
is
promptly
ensued
and
complemented
by
a
combination
of
buttered
sweet
biscuit
freshly
baked
brittle
and
woody
fructose
rich
dried
dates
bellicose
hop
presence
storms
in
mid
palate
with
both
barbed
bitterness
and
a
deeply
sappy
spruce
and
citrus
pith
hop
flavor
emerging
concomitantly
this
more
than
adequately
tapers
malt
sweetness
and
leaves
a
static
simplified
yet
richly
buttery
toffee
malt
presence
that
mirrors
that
of
the
aroma
full
bodied
and
firmly
dextrinous
with
a
oily
unwhipped
heavy
cream
like
viscous
mouthfeel
a
late
resurgence
of
biscuit
couples
with
the
constituent
citrus
and
stately
diacetyl
lending
a
rich
bitter
marmalade
on
singed
toast
impression
finishes
clean
and
simply
bitter
with
a
mellow
roasted
grain
and
alpha
acid
extension
agreeable
alcohol
warmth
surfaces
after
a
deliberation
and
envelopes
the
palate
throat
and
tummy
a
truly
delicious
brew
thats
reminescent
of
their
old
guardian
in
overall
character
but
is
seemingly
more
balanced
and
drinkable
double
bastard
is
a
deceptively
mild
mannered
strong
ale
that
integrates
robust
hop
character
into
a
malt
driven
flavor
profile
superlatively
drinkable
another
wonderful
stone
brew
drinkability
should
i
enjoy
the
asskicking
this
beer
has
imparted
on
me
yes
indeed
i
should
this
is
one
amazing
beer
such
a
complex
and
intense
beer
the
flavors
got
warmer
and
richer
as
the
beer
came
to
room
temperature
not
one
to
quaff
but
rather
sip
and
enjoy
as
the
twin
gargoyles
pound
your
into
oblivion
notes
drink
this
beer
after
the
others
that
youre
trying
very
few
can
keep
up
2001
version
deep
ruby
color
medium
head
aroma
is
malty
with
a
hint
of
brown
sugar
and
fruit
wow
this
is
one
of
a
big
beer
a
full
bodied
strong
ale
big
and
bold
this
beers
malts
and
hops
reach
out
and
grab
you
places
you
may
not
want
to
be
grabbed
it
could
be
very
painful
flavor
is
full
and
complex
brown
sugar
molasses
hop
spiciness
grapefruit
and
are
all
here
and
assault
your
taste
buds
this
is
one
kickass
beer
not
for
the
timid
taste
is
thick
somewhat
chewy
and
a
little
high
alcohol
oily
mouthfeel
is
full
round
and
expansive
finish
is
clean
and
surprisingly
smooth
aftertaste
is
slightly
bitter
and
warming
the
10
alcohol
gets
to
you
after
a
bit
nice
and
warming
amazing
beer
not
for
everyone
most
will
not
be
worthy
its
a
pretty
good
beer
but
so
completely
over
the
top
that
i
doubt
ill
ever
buy
it
again
the
beer
is
just
way
too
intense
especially
at
first
the
flavors
are
wellwrought
but
sort
of
hamfisted
in
the
way
that
its
trying
so
hard
to
assault
you
with
everything
in
its
arsenal
a
kick
you
in
the
teeth
spit
on
your
face
then
get
up
and
give
me
twenty
kind
of
beer
2002
release
courtesy
of
feloniousmonk
like
many
of
stone
beers
this
is
a
beer
that
is
much
better
off
if
you
give
it
time
to
age
i
did
a
vertical
comparison
of
the
last
2
years
and
the
older
one
is
much
better
since
the
flavors
have
had
time
to
meld
and
come
together
better
another
of
stones
famous
limited
releases
so
get
it
if
you
can
and
put
it
away
for
a
year
or
two
strong
sweet
burnt
but
still
somehow
delicious
thats
the
thing
2002
bottle
well
here
it
is
another
highly
anticipated
bottle
from
stone
the
beer
pours
a
slightly
reddish
color
the
head
has
a
little
bit
of
a
cascade
to
it
the
head
is
fairly
thick
and
lingers
awhile
very
complex
nose
its
hard
to
distinguish
the
individual
aromas
what
is
suprisingly
not
jumping
out
at
me
are
the
aroma
of
hops
ive
come
to
expect
that
in
a
stone
brew
the
taste
is
very
rich
a
huge
maly
sweetness
that
im
sure
is
balanced
by
a
large
amount
of
hops
that
are
just
well
hidden
the
alcohol
is
also
hidden
i
like
this
more
than
the
arrogant
one
it
is
even
surpassing
the
03
vertical
epic
to
be
my
favorite
stone
2001
vintage
if
you
like
bitter
this
is
the
beer
its
a
bit
too
bitter
for
me
however
surprisingly
it
finishes
rather
smoothly
definitely
worth
trying
pours
a
captivating
redcopper
color
with
amber
highlights
it
is
topped
by
a
modest
tan
head
that
fades
rather
quickly
but
leaves
a
thin
film
of
foam
atop
the
beer
the
aroma
is
actually
rather
balanced
with
a
noticeable
hop
prescence
and
a
wonderfully
sweet
and
fruity
malt
aroma
actually
the
sweetness
may
dominate
the
aroma
the
taste
is
delicious
malty
sweet
chewy
flavors
of
roasted
malt
caramel
malted
milkshakes
and
all
kinds
of
fruit
a
nice
mellow
bitterness
finishes
off
the
palate
very
well
preparing
the
way
for
the
next
drink
an
ever
so
slight
alcohol
note
is
detectable
one
drink
but
not
the
next
abv
is
expertly
hidden
the
mouthfeel
is
supercreamy
and
must
be
experienced
to
believe
this
is
about
as
thin
as
dom
delouise
and
smoother
than
billy
dee
williams
drinkability
is
just
too
good
regardless
of
the
abv
good
thing
this
is
a
big
bottle
or
id
be
in
tears
about
now
this
is
a
beer
to
experience
thanks
to
avylover
for
the
trade
who
knows
when
i
would
have
found
this
around
here
once
again
stone
brewing
blows
my
mind
nb
the
aged
draught
version
rated
here
was
2
or
3
tenths
better
overall
than
the
bottle
thanks
gusler
cheers
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
i
could
just
feel
is
going
to
be
good
even
before
opening
it
pours
a
dark
ruby
color
and
has
a
well
retained
head
aroma
is
big
on
malt
and
big
on
hops
i
think
its
safe
to
say
this
is
a
big
beer
initial
tast
is
of
butterscotch
before
the
hops
and
alcohol
kick
in
this
is
certaintly
among
my
top
beers
smooth
oily
mouthfeel
and
on
the
lower
end
of
carbonation
drinkability
is
very
high
id
love
another
one
but
i
know
better
that
and
i
only
got
one
from
gusler
on
trade
that
man
is
wise
beyond
his
years
beers
thanks
joe
you
really
hooked
me
up
with
this
one
a
serious
barley
with
some
hops
that
match
and
not
overpower
it
rounded
out
by
many
nuances
of
the
eight
ive
enjoyed
definitely
the
best
stone
product
besides
when
they
cask
the
ipa
for
some
lucky
bastards
wow
so
this
is
the
bigger
meaner
brother
of
arrogant
bastard
ale
overall
this
is
a
good
full
flavored
beer
lots
of
complex
flavors
and
another
winner
by
stone
i
was
blessed
by
my
girlfriend
with
the
huge
bottle
of
the
double
bastard
ale
opened
on
new
years
eve
my
brother
and
i
drank
the
majority
of
this
potent
brew
the
alcohol
level
is
definitely
evident
in
the
aroma
and
taste
and
after
a
couple
of
pints
i
was
quite
numb
the
amber
color
is
perfect
and
the
pour
is
easy
no
concerns
of
spilling
the
head
over
even
with
the
higher
alcohol
percentage
the
drinkability
is
easy
and
smooth
with
some
definite
hop
and
slight
kick
in
the
ass
with
the
alcohol
ruby
golden
color
with
a
syrupy
look
to
it
this
beer
looks
like
it
means
business
even
before
you
pop
the
top
tried
arrogant
bastard
so
this
could
only
be
better
right
right
smell
is
malty
caramel
with
a
hint
of
alcohol
nice
once
this
beer
hits
the
tongue
thats
when
the
hops
hit
you
this
is
a
great
blend
of
huge
sweet
maltiness
and
huge
bittercitrous
hops
i
could
find
something
new
in
the
taste
every
sip
and
the
high
abv
is
a
great
bonus
great
mouthfeel
with
a
nice
taste
lingering
after
every
sip
coating
the
mouth
with
malt
and
sizzling
my
tongue
with
hops
and
if
i
had
a
steel
liver
drinkability
would
be
a
5
so
a
4
5
is
fair
one
of
the
best
of
any
style
top
notch
beer
hands
down
whenever
you
see
this
beer
buy
it
this
is
one
wicked
brew
i
dont
usually
favor
the
barley
wines
but
this
one
rips
its
got
a
very
beautiful
dark
red
color
almost
of
blood
but
darker
the
head
was
pretty
thick
at
first
but
died
down
to
a
laceing
the
head
was
a
creamy
white
color
i
thought
that
the
taste
had
a
little
bit
of
a
bite
to
it
at
first
but
mellowed
out
after
a
while
it
had
a
nice
fruitt
flavor
probably
of
the
citrus
origin
mixed
with
some
caramel
or
lite
chocolate
the
aftertaste
was
kind
of
peppery
but
not
too
bad
being
a
bastard
myself
i
must
say
that
this
is
one
bastard
of
a
beer
a
double
bastard
that
is
hehehe
pours
a
hazy
light
amber
with
a
persistant
off
white
head
aroma
is
perfumy
and
sweet
with
caramel
floral
citrus
and
pine
notes
flavor
is
very
sweet
and
malty
beginning
with
caramel
then
becoming
somewhat
buttery
with
a
very
aggressive
dose
of
spicy
citrusy
hop
bitterness
the
flavors
balance
pretty
well
but
this
beer
is
just
big
its
bold
in
every
facet
the
moutfeel
is
oily
and
thick
with
moderate
carbonation
a
great
beer
although
for
regular
consumption
not
quite
as
drinkable
as
its
little
brother
big
thanks
go

with
a

slightly
orange
tinges
head
decent
lacing
aroma
is
of
pine
citrus
some
sweet
and
spice
in
there
and
a
grassiness
starts
of
sweet
and
spicy
then
does
and
about
face
in
the
middle
as
the
hops
come
through
and
a
warming
alcohol
shows
up
as
it
gets
warmer
mouthfeel
is
big
and
strong
with
lots
of
complexity
i
have
been
waiting
to
try
this
for
weeks
i
had
managed
to
buy
a
bottle
and
not
touch
it
for
two
weeks
this
saturday
night
i
broke
down
and
i
am
glad
that
i
did
amber
in
color
with
almost
no
head
even
after
an
aggresive
pour
the
first
thing
that
i
noticed
was
how
smooth
this
beer
was
hops
malt
blaaaaa
complex
overwelming
and
delicious
let
this
one
warm
up
a
bit
in
the
glass
the
flavors
really
come
out
then
a
bit
like
a
barley
wine
but
even
better
very
warming
as
it
goes
down
when
my
22oz
bottle
was
gone
i
could
have
cried
i
must
get
more
this
beast
pours
into
a
deep
amber
color
and
a
creamy
offwhite
head
the
aroma
alone
could
knock
you
over
screaming
of
a
major
hop
addition
and
a
bold
malt
presence
the
initial
taste
is
like
eating
a
lit
cherry
bomb
the
gigantic
malt
sweetness
couples
with
an
otherworldly
offensive
bitterness
on
top
of
a
smooth
thick
body
this
brew
definitely
has
an
arrogant
personality
this
ale
could
take
my
place
in
a
bar
fight
id
just
sit
back
and
let
it
kick
everyone
elses
ass
i
treid
tasting
a
couple
beers
after
this
one
and
my
taste
buds
were
completely
shot
useless
to
me
for
the
rest
of
the
evening
so
drink
up
but
drink
last
ps
i
had
this
bar
at
mahars
in
albany
check
the
beerfly
review
this
place
is
unreal
they
had
a
raffle
going
for
a
magnum
of
5th
anniversary
arrogant
bastard
the
bottle
had
a
cork
obviously
and
a
big
5
on
it
but
i
didnt
look
close
i
just
bought
a
ticket
and
offered
praise
worship
and
eternal
servitude
to
any
god
who
would
bless
me
with
a
winning
ticket
pours
a
deep
reddish
brown
with
a
nice
darker
than
offwhite
head
which
is
nice
and
foamy
and
lingering
the
aroma
is
nicely
caramelly
malty
with
a
slight
hop
bite
the
flavor
is
big
rich
earthy
malts
and
a
long
bitter
finish
this
is
definitely
a
sipping
beer
as
its
very
hard
to
drink
fast
when
it
nears
room
temperature
it
starts
to
get
a
little
too
sweet
and
thick
but
served
just
below
cellar
temp
and
this
is
an
excellent
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
whipped
airy
liquid
cream
any
thoughts
on
how
this
beer
will
be
given
some
time
to
rest
if
only
i
could
find
some
more
i
have
never
opened
a
beer
with
as
much
anticipation
as
this
one
it
has
been
mocking
me
waiting
for
me
to
grab
it
and
succomb
to
its
goodness
it
pours
a
deep
dense
amber
with
a
nice
white
head
i
would
swear
this
is
a
barleywine
complex
maltiness
with
the
signature
arrogant
bastard
hop
flavors
this
is
an
excellent
beer
without
a
doubt
one
of
my
favorites
a
hearty
thanks
goes
out
to
xlperro
who
turned
me
on
to
this
stuff
this
is
one
mother
of
a
beer
i
think
the
lable
should
have
a
skull
with
crossbones
to
inform
the
consumer
of
what
to
expect
this
beer
has
a
full
onslaught
of
malt
and
hops
that
will
even
take
the
most
professional
of
beer
drinkers
down
to
their
knees
this
beer
is
not
for
the
timid
and
even
the
worthy
of
his
arrogant
brother
may
be
no
match
for
this
beer
although
i
did
have
fun
photographing
the
unworthys
bitter
beer
face
upon
drinking
this
stuff
452
to
be
honest
i
wasnt
expecting
to
like
this
beer
sweet
high
malt
and
alcohol
beers
arent
among
my
favorites
but
db
is
different
yes
it
has
a
strong
malt
character
that
seems
somewhat
carmel
in
nature
and
obviously
is
high
in
alcohol
but
this
thing
is
hopped
like
an
ipa
flavor
explodes
the
second
it
hits
your
tongue
but
its
definitely
not
all
about
the
malt
the
hops
do
way
more
than
just
balance
this
beer
hops
seem
piney
in
nature
db
finishes
well
although
the
10
abv
is
evident
pours
a
dark
coppery
red
with
a
nice
tan
head
both
malt
and
hops
can
be
noted
in
the
aroma
very
drinkable
for
a
beer
of
this
magnitude
awesome
beer
with
great
malt
and
hop
character
had
this
beer
2
days
ago
and
i
cant
get
it
off
my
mind
i
only
wish
i
could
get
more
but
ill
likely
have
to
wait
until
next
year
this
was
the
first
year
ohios
beer
laws
allowed
double
bastard
in
the
state
much
to
my
dismay
the
supply
in
bottles
was
gone
before
i
attempted
to
purchase
some
but
all
was
not
lost
a
local
pub
had
received
1
keg
according
to
the
bartender
there
were
only
2
shipped
to
the
entire
distributing
area
i
was
lucky
here
because
my
freind
and
i
drew
off
the
last
2
pints
next
year
i
wont
be
tardy
on
the
arrival
of
this
one
this
beer
poured
a
dark
reddish
amber
color
and
formed
a
nice
light
tan
foamy
head
that
looked
like
a
float
subsiding
and
left
circular
lace
some
carbonation
is
present
an
aroma
of
malt
caramel
spices
with
a
hint
of
the
alcohol
present
a
flavor
of
malt
caramel
with
a
touch
of
chocolate
the
finish
is
sweet
with
a
slight
astrigent
element
to
it
another
fine
beer
from
stone
and
another
thank
you
to
the
ohio
lawmakers
for
letting
get
this
this
beer
could
be
purchased
solely
for
the
diatribe
on
the
back
of
the
bottle
tasted
at
the
barrelhouse
brewing
company
microbrew
fest
on
november
9
this
beer
is
knockyoursocksoff
strong
who
is
worthy
indeed
lively
complex
and
fervent
flavors
throughout
a
great
dessert
beer
and
another
winner
from
stone
an
absolutely
amazing
brew
a
friend
said
it
best
when
he
said
holy
s
upon
his
first
sip
the
beer
is
full
of
grapefruit
and
other
cirtus
aromas
topped
off
with
some
caramel
and
sweetness
that
binds
everything
together
dark
red
in
color
and
nearly
opaque
with
a
nice
bit
of
white
head
the
beer
fills
your
mouth
with
flavors
and
has
complexity
off
the
charts
but
still
comes
off
as
somewhat
delicate
grapefruit
caramel
and
a
bit
of
pine
jostle
for
dominance
in
the
mouth
and
are
followed
by
a
nice
dry
and
bitter
finish
definitely
not
a
beer
you
want
to
drink
quickly
or
you
will
a
miss
out
on
a
lot
of
flavor
and
b
be
knocked
on
your
ass
from
the
alcohol
suprisingly
good
at
room
temperature
had
left
a
3rd
of
the
bottle
sitting
out
where
the
hops
mellow
out
but
the
flavors
are
all
still
there
truly
amazing
simply
amazing
2001
batch
22
oz
bottle
pours
a
clear
very
deep
rubytinted
russet
brown
with
a
densely
creamy
light
tan
head
that
holds
extremely
well
and
leaves
some
nice
lace
exceptional
the
aroma
offers
bold
notes
of
pineapple
soft
grapefruit
and
berries
as
well
as
some
grassy
earthy
and
piney
hops
all
of
which
reside
above
a
candyish
and
lightly
caramel
tinged
maltiness
the
body
is
full
with
a
very
fine
median
carbonation
thats
creamy
and
just
slightly
syrupy
in
the
mouth
the
flavor
starts
quite
sweet
reveals
its
deep
fruitiness
and
then
some
very
rich
caramel
maltiness
along
with
some
clear
alcohol
a
solid
bitterness
balances
well
against
the
rich
malt
solid
but
not
overly
bitter
the
finish
is
surprisingly
clean
and
dry
for
such
a
sweet
and
malty
beer
i
was
really
surprised
by
this
beer
firstly
at
how
different
it
was
from
the
arrogant
bastard
secondly
at
how
directly
the
fruitiness
found
in
their
flagship
pale
ale
was
carried
over
and
thirdly
at
how
good
it
was
this
is
a
really
exceptional
beer
that
may
smooth
a
bit
with
some
age
on
it
although
i
dont
think
the
alcohol
will
cool
much
further
2002
release
well
here
i
go
after
so
much
anticipation
and
excitement
i
finally
have
a
glass
of
200
pure
bastard
in
front
of
me
alright
enough
talk
im
eager
to
dig
in
invitingly
evil
or
is
that
evilly
inviting
deep
crimson
color
a
twofinger
tan
head
sits
on
top
stays
well
at
first
then
disappears
huge
and
i
mean
massive
aroma
and
on
top
of
that
very
complex
citrus
jumps
out
at
you
first
then
raisin
and
plum
just
a
touch
of
alcohol
malt
is
deep
inside
but
definitely
present
on
the
palate
ever
hear
the
term
flavor
rush
i
think
its
associated
with
some
brand
of
potato
chips
well
thats
not
flavor
rush
double
bastard
is
flavor
rush
my
taste
buds
didnt
know
what
hit
them
so
many
complex
flavors
hit
the
different
parts
of
your
tongue
ill
try
to
describe
them
malt
and
hop
sections
are
both
at
maximum
capacity
here
malt
is
caramel
and
a
bit
peatlike
extremely
chewy
thick
and
tonguecoating
hops
are
aggressive
pine
and
citrus
a
bit
leafy
and
floral
on
the
edges
as
well
raisin
plum
and
berries
have
a
big
presence
too
with
the
hops
this
creates
kind
of
a
plum
or
berry
skin
bittersweetness
which
is
a
very
unique
thing
it
even
stays
on
in
the
aftertaste
alcohol
presence
although
noticeable
is
minimal
for
a
brew
of
this
size
grainy
malt
is
noticeable
as
well
mostly
in
the
aftertaste
you
could
almost
call
this
a
barleywine
but
that
wouldnt
do
its
strength
justice
i
must
say
this
is
beer
heaven
i
cant
even
put
it
into
words
all
i
have
to
say
is
im
getting
as
much
more
as
i
possibly
can
when
i
go
back
to
the
store
tomorrow
this
bad
boy
poured
a
very
deep
amber
slightly
tan
head
settled
down
to
a
thin
persistent
layer
lacework
was
erratic
but
good
the
aroma
was
very
inviting
and
the
taste
was
hoppy
and
very
powerful
with
a
noticible
alcohol
presence
i
tasted
notes
of
grapefruit
on
some
sips
and
more
malt
on
others
a
very
big
complex
beer
that
is
very
well
made
and
has
exceptional
mouthfeel
very
full
bodied
and
rounded
i
will
say
though
that
i
dont
enjoy
getting
hammered
on
one
bottle
i
guess
for
me
10
is
just
a
bit
too
much
im
not
ashamed
to
admit
this
but
i
will
say
its
a
fine
brew
nonetheless
a
massive
barley
winelike
ale
and
a
good
choice
for
those
who
want
a
strong
ale
that
will
kick
you
in
the
teeth
ill
hang
back
and
settle
for
arrogance
dont
plan
on
drinking
anything
else
after
this
beer
first
itll
taste
like
tapwater
and
second
you
simply
dont
need
any
more
alcohol
after
this
go
take
a
nap
and
have
pleasant
dreams
of
the
next
great
offering
from
stone
instead
holy
christ
on
a
crutch
can
you
form
a
religion
around
a
beer
this
beer
is
everyting
the
name
suggests
and
then
some
extremely
drinakble
for
a
10
beer
even
more
so
as
it
warms
up
and
very
warming
treat
this
beer
with
respect
and
enjoy
thanks
to
greg
koch
for
the
sample
and
for
making
this
since
i
just
tried
the
02
version
im
updating
and
upgading
my
orginal
review
this
beer
is
nothing
short
of
beer
bliss
yes
its
packed
with
hops
but
its
also
packed
with
malt
and
an
amazing
array
of
flavors
similar
in
flavor
and
complexity
to
a
good
cognac
dont
pass
on
this
one
if
you
see
it
around
a
powerful
hop
aroma
that
is
part
sweet
and
part
hoppy
deep
rich
and
full
aroma
this
beer
would
be
perfect
if
only
sniffed
but
the
taste
slightly
smoky
side
of
hop
flavor
slightly
earthy
big
body
balances
great
as
it
warms
deep
alcohol
aroma
its
a
rare
day
when
a
beer
makes
me
consider
brand
fidelity
and
a
longterm
committment
this
one
has
my
full
attention
and
appreciation
notes
yikes
barley
wine
in
character
but
dont
say
that
in
front
of
the
beer
because
it
will
set
you
straight
this
is
a
american
nitro
no
holds
barred
monster
truck
bitch
slappin
strong
ale
youll
feel
the
redness
on
your
checks
after
this
one
slaps
you
around
youre
probably
better
off
not
drinking
this
one
alone
just
from
the
dominance
and
arrogance
let
alone
the
whopping
10
abv
overall
very
good
brew
something
that
was
very
well
needed
for
a
pretty
long
day
happy
easter
to
everyone
salud
another
soulf
stone
creation
in
the
end
this
well
blended
gem
comes
off
much
like
a
lightbodied
version
of
a
bourbon
barrel
barleywine
bourbon
was
very
heavy
really
felt
just
like
watered
down
bourbon
overall
about
what
i
expected
arrogant
bastard
bourbon
im
not
a
fan
of
the
regular
version
but
this
is
certainly
better
still
has
a
lingering
bitterness
that
seems
to
strong
bbl
effects
complement
rather
than
overposwering
the
underlying
ale
malty
piney
and
bourbon
a
bit
thin
i
think
double
or
lucky
would
have
been
a
better
base
solid
ba
beer
i
like
how
the
bourbon
doesnt
show
up
like
a
bully
and
start
pushing
all
the
other
flavors
around
nice
barrel
character
as
well
was
not
feeling
this
the
base
beer
is
a
solid
brew
and
i
felt
like
the
barrel
aging
hindered
my
enjoyment
of
the
beer
instead
of
enhanced
it
found
the
after
taste
to
be
unpleasant
o
this
kinda
tastes
like
you
dropped
a
shot
of
bourbon
into
an
arrogant
bastard
its
very
bourbon
forward
which
runs
over
any
other
flavors
that
may
be
present
nice
amber
hue
with
excellent
clarity
a
fingernail
of
khaki
colored
head
rests
on
top
light
brussels
lacing
loads
of
malt
and
notes
of
sweet
bourbon
are
apparent
in
the
nose
the
flavor
is
initially
malt
and
then
a
wallop
of
bourbon
and
plenty
more
bready
malt
citrus
hops
reveal
themselves
in
the
back
of
the
palate
the
mouth
is
thick
and
a
bit
warm
with
alcohol
overall
really
good
and
complex
but
not
my
favorite
arrogant
bastard
mouthfeel
is
dry
moderately
thin
overall
i
think
id
rather
have
regular
arrogant
bastard
but
this
isnt
bad
not
for
the
everyday
but
i
would
be
glad
to
have
this
again
sometime
overall
this
may
be
the
best
variation
on
a
bastard
stone
have
come
up
with
yet
was
it
worth
the
expense
to
buy
a
4
pack
with
three
other
bastard
variants
to
get
it
though
ummm
poured
from
a
bomber
into
a
mug
the
beer
is
a
dark
brown
with
amber
highlights
a
thin
foamy
clingy
offwhite
head
some
carbonation
action
throughout
the
body
too
aromas
of
vanilla
brown
sugar
resinous
hops
a
subtle
spice
blend
and
old
world
fruit
sweetness
very
rich
and
layered
flavors
are
hopped
bitter
forward
with
a
resinous
blast
of
bitter
green
notes
followed
by
a
vanilla
and
woody
undertone
a
heavy
dose
of
booze
and
all
of
the
sweet
and
rich
notes
from
the
aromas
seem
to
lessen
very
subtle
belgian
yeast
notes
and
spice
blend
nod
their
head
in
there
too
to
add
some
depth
the
body
is
robust
and
smooth
with
a
boozy
and
hop
resinous
aftertaste
the
finish
is
slick
and
dry
with
a
booze
and
old
world
fruit
linger
cleaned
up
from
the
heavy
hops
bitterness
big
beer
and
damn
tasty
o
excellent
beer
o
my
favorite
variant
and
i
think
i
like
this
more
than
ab
really
well
balanced
and
just
enough
bourbon
without
the
booziness
overall
7
8
used
to
be
a
huge
beernow
its
fairly
tame
that
said
7
8
is
still
dangerous
especially
when
it
goes
down
this
easy
and
with
this
much
interesting
complexity
to
keep
you
coming
back
for
that
next
sip
little
disappointed
about
this
beer
is
very
thin
little
to
no
bourbon
flavor
a
little
oak
flavor
and
a
bit
bitter
on
the
finish
overall
i
still
find
the
base
ab
brew
delicious
the
kiss
of
bourbon
up
front
was
very
nice
i
wish
the
barrel
aging
could
have
been
longer
than
a
few
weeks
or
however
long
it
was
pours
a
nice
clear
amber
color
with
a
white
two
finger
head
of
active
foam
that
hangs
around
a
decent
time
smells
of
malt
and
wood
with
a
sweet
finish
the
taste
is
that
of
a
slightly
more
refined
arrogant
bastard
the
bourbon
is
subtle
at
best
but
a
nice
vanilla
tone
is
to
be
found
along
with
brown
sugar
and
a
nice
alcohol
tingle
it
has
decent
body
and
adequate
carbonation
to
produce
an
enjoyable
feeling
overall
it
is
a
great
beer
it
will
probably
fall
short
of
what
some
people
expect
from
a
barrel
aged
beer
but
its
a
solid
offering
if
you
like
regular
arrogant
bastard
this
is
certainly
worth
trying
o
nice
balanced
beer
that
id
happily
have
all
the
time
f
fairly
light
bodied
for
a
barrel
aged
beer
somewhat
creamy
long
bitter
finish
o
tasty
though
i
like
the
original
arrogant
bastard
better
this
could
use
more
bourbon
influence
and
needs
to
round
out
the
body
on
the
back
half
sampled
at
snallygaster
2014
like
arrogant
bastard
with
a
hint
of
bourbon
lots
of
negative
reviews
but
i
think
this
one
is
excellent
perfect
for
all
of
those
haters
of
the
regular
arrogant
bastard
this
one
is
much
less
aggressive
and
bitter
than
the
regular
great
balance
of
malt
sweetness
to
bitter
hop
with
a
nice
but
not
overpowering
bourbon
presence
would
definitely
buy
again
if
i
had
the
chance
seemed
like
a
weak
effort
by
stone
to
get
something
in
the
bourbon
barrel
aged
category
very
mild
bourbon
flavor
was
a
nice
addition
but
didnt
add
that
much
complexity
to
the
beer
overall
expected
more
from
this
one
overall
a
pretty
good
balanced
brew
good
strong
notes
of
earthy
hops
and
toasty
malt
the
barrel
presence
could
have
been
a
little
stronger
o
the
barrel
tames
arrogant
bastard
a
bit
this
is
still
a
ridiculously
aggressive
beer
but
where
the
base
beer
by
itself
never
falls
below
notch
11
this
is
smoothed
down
to
perhaps
a
9
5
the
hops
in
particular
are
a
little
less
bitey
the
barrel
itself
adds
a
woody
and
charred
character
that
complements
whats
already
gong
on
a
shorter
aging
of
about
a
year
give
or
take
a
little
time
might
even
be
appropriate
though
not
necessary
o
good
beer
overall
i
would
pick
this
one
up
again
if
i
saw
it
o
a
great
variation
of
an
already
great
beer
o
a
lot
of
the
ab
variants
have
been
hit
or
miss
with
me
but
this
is
a
definite
hit
pours
serene
with
ruby
glow
tan
head
of
creamy
foam
the
taller
glass
favored
the
look
better
on
my
two
pours
sweet
tropical
with
a
bourbon
scent
light
bread
and
a
soft
floral
really
light
sweet
wood
its
bitter
and
herbal
in
the
drink
with
tea
like
back
note
soft
pepper
very
nice
the
bourbon
on
the
palate
is
round
sweetness
among
leafier
more
herbal
qualities
strong
warming
finishes
dry
and
bitter
like
a
tonic
with
a
touch
of
sweet
fruit
this
is
really
unexpected
and
a
neat
creation
like
how
it
manages
the
hop
forward
aspects
of
classic
arrogant
bastard
but
with
some
real
interesting
barrel
character
that
push
the
flavor
and
feel
in
a
different
direction
real
cool
overall
i
feel
like
the
barrel
in
this
added
a
really
refined
feel
to
the
regular
ab
and
i
love
how
stone
used
the
barrel
to
add
complexity
and
nuance
ultimately
complementing
instead
of
dominating
a
masterful
touch
which
resulted
in
smoothing
out
regular
abs
more
rough
arrogant
characteristics
a
fantastic
brew
getting
no
barrel
whatsoever
kind
of
think
it
was
a
scam
by
stone
to
get
people
to
buy
boxes
pretty
disappointed
in
this
taste
like
regular
ab
seriously
no
effort
was
put
into
this
d
good
beer
glad
to
try
do
drinkability
is
much
like
the
other
arrogant
bastards
personally
i
could
only
do
one
bomber
in
an
evening
this
beer
is
meant
to
be
savored
and
enjoyed
not
to
be
drank
in
a
serial
manner
overall
this
is
a
world
class
beer
made
better
with
bourbon
barrel
aging
bravo
4
5
not
an
amazing
beer
an
interesting
drink
kinda
confused
between
some
of
the
complex
flavors
generally
i
am
a
fan
of
bourbon
and
bba
brews
but
i
honestly
prefer
this
arrogant
bastard
without
the
bourbon
smooth
but
thin
bodied
this
beer
has
a
complex
flavor
very
good
darker
malt
base
to
start
but
the
swallow
brings
a
nice
if
subtle
hop
bitterness
long
aftertaste
maybe
the
best
value
barrel
aged
ale
ive
had
bastard
bomber
4
pack
from
costco
was
15
00
and
that
include
a
lucky
and
a
double
bastard
as
well
it
does
taste
a
little
boozy
for
the
surprisingly
low
abv
but
i
very
much
enjoyed
i
got
the
bourbon
flavor
right
up
front
and
found
it
still
lingered
after
the
swallow
along
with
a
woody
finish
22oz
bottle
from
the
box
of
bastards
4
pack
pours
a
semi
translucent
reddish
brown
with
very
little
head
some
lacing
smells
of
bourbon
vanilla
bread
caramel
malts
and
raisins
the
taste
is
bourbon
and
lots
of
wood
some
vanilla
as
well
as
more
breadiness
dark
fruits
and
some
light
citrus
peel
a
bit
nutty
tastes
boozier
than
the
7
8
abv
finishes
with
more
bourbon
and
wood
flavor
light
mouthfeel
with
not
a
lot
of
carbonation
overall
its
a
pretty
decent
beer
but
not
much
of
an
improvement
on
the
regular
and
oaked
versions
good
job
stone
o
an
enjoyable
beer
overall
but
i
wish
the
bourbon
were
stepped
up
a
couple
of
notches
arrogant
bastard
is
a
potent
aggressive
beer
and
the
barrel
treatment
just
cant
seem
to
compete
at
all
with
whats
already
in
the
beer
o
the
vanilla
notes
from
the
barrel
are
the
biggest
difference
from
the
base
but
the
barrel
definitely
effects
the
beer
in
a
good
way
overall
not
hot
or
overly
boozy
in
any
way
which
makes
it
nicely
drinkable
and
a
solid
release
definitely
worth
picking
up
in
the
bastard
box
22
oz
bomber
got
this
in
a
four
pack
with
other
bastards
poured
into
20
oz
firestone
glass
a
golden
color
smell
is
quite
hoppy
i
loved
this
got
to
say
it
went
down
great
have
not
tried
the
rest
of
the
box
but
if
there
all
like
this
im
going
to
love
this
set
great
price
of
19
99
for
four
bastards
nice
abv
of
7
8
pick
some
of
these
up
if
your
a
stone
fan
you
will
love
it
bottle
pours
a
clear
amber
color
with
a
mild
head
aroma
is
sweet
and
oaky
with
noticeable
bourbon
character
the
flavor
is
highly
influenced
by
the
barrel
lacks
the
bitterness
that
the
base
beer
boasts
its
fruity
and
sweet
with
some
caramel
and
toast
flavor
the
finish
is
heavy
with
bourbon
character
vanilla
bean
dried
tannic
woodiness
genuine
bourbon
finish
the
barrel
dominated
much
of
the
beer
as
it
should
fuller
bodied
with
ligher
carbonation
and
lingering
woody
flavor
not
my
favorite
bastard
but
a
new
take
on
an
old
standby
overall
if
i
didnt
know
any
better
id
swear
this
were
the
oaked
ab
i
just
get
very
little
bourbon
influence
its
much
more
oak
driven
id
love
to
do
a
side
by
side
because
i
dont
think
theyre
far
off
they
both
tame
the
abs
aggressiveness
with
a
nice
mellow
oak
woodiness
overall
and
a
steal
at
which
i
got
the
bastard
box
22
ounce
bottle
printing
is
a
bit
smudged
but
it
looks
like
it
says
it
was
bottled
on
092414
served
in
a
snifter
the
beer
pours
a
mostly
clear
ruby
redchestnut
brown
color
with
about
an
inch
light
tan
head
head
retention
is
ok
and
theres
a
lot
of
lacing
i
like
the
aroma
it
smells
like
piney
hops
dark
fruit
caramel
oak
and
a
bit
of
vanilla
and
bourbon
i
think
the
taste
is
pretty
much
just
like
the
aroma
but
theres
also
some
bready
malt
and
citrus
peel
noticeable
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
coating
and
has
a
decent
amount
of
carbonation
im
not
sure
how
long
this
was
aged
in
bourbon
barrels
but
id
guess
it
wasnt
for
a
very
long
time
not
that
im
complaining
but
this
was
hoppier
and
less
bourbony
than
i
expected
it
to
be
with
that
being
said
i
liked
it
part
of
the
bastard
box
20
for
bombers
of
regular
bourbon
barrel
lukcy
basartd
and
double
bastard
isnt
a
bad
deal
at
all
this
one
is
a
lower
abv
and
thus
lighter
bodied
bba
than
im
used
to
but
i
came
to
really
enjoy
it
the
smoke
oak
and
bourbon
flavors
are
very
much
there
but
its
not
overpoweringly
boozy
or
syrupy
if
you
want
a
beer
that
imparts
the
taste
of
bourbon
but
isnt
gonna
hit
you
over
the
head
this
great
by
the
end
i
thought
i
was
drinking
liquid
wood
in
a
good
way
arrogant
bastard
bitterness
was
still
somewhat
there
and
it
blended
nicely
on
the
finish
with
the
woody
qualities
even
for
bourbon
drinkers
who
dont
always
want
to
sip
on
a
whiskey
to
get
the
flavors
theyre
after
should
try
this
beer
if
they
get
the
chance
while
i
enjoyed
bourbon
barrel
aged
arrogant
bastard
a
little
more
than
the
base
it
fell
short
of
being
the
southern
charred
jr
i
hoped
for
still
an
enjoyable
enough
brew
that
im
happy
to
have
tried
gotta
love
the
perks
of
showing
up
right
at
the
beginning
of
a
stone
minitaptakeover
this
stuff
pours
a
lightlyhazy
tawnyamber
topped
by
a
finger
of
dirty
khaki
foam
gotta
take
those
slacks
off
before
you
hit
the
rugby
pitch
the
nose
comprises
oak
maple
syrup
mild
whiskey
and
mixed
greens
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
a
tad
more
syrup
and
oak
some
pine
resin
and
a
twinge
of
sharp
grapefruit
rind
the
body
is
a
straight
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
fluid
feel
overall
i
feel
some
of
the
bastard
is
missing
in
this
incarnation
but
its
pretty
tasty
regardless
a
good
barrel
that
is
woody
but
not
like
a
2x4
smooth
yet
fresh
feeling
oak
the
essence
of
arrogance
balances
this
out
and
overall
its
a
smooth
flavorful
beast
poured
into
an
arrogant
bastard
ale
pint
glass
pours
a
deep
red
amber
with
ruby
tones
and
a
half
finger
light
khaki
head
that
dissipates
to
patches
but
leaving
good
lacing
aroma
of
caramel
malt
citrus
hops
light
oak
and
bourbon
flavor
is
mellow
dark
malt
with
suggestions
of
dark
dried
fruit
citrus
hops
and
a
pleasant
light
oak
and
bourbon
overlay
lightly
creamy
body
but
light
carbonation
an
interesting
take
on
the
arrogant
bastard
line
with
the
same
classic
hop
profile
but
softer
and
more
integrated
the
malt
is
reminiscent
of
old
ale
malt
more
than
the
lighter
caramel
malt
in
the
base
beer
which
is
a
great
fit
with
the
other
flavors
the
bourbon
and
oak
are
less
forward
than
in
other
bourbon
ales
or
oaked
bastard
but
integrate
well
although
there
is
a
good
bitter
finish
no
a
hop
bomb
like
the
base
beer
and
other
variants
but
still
hop
forward
very
different
than
the
original
and
from
what
i
expected
but
i
like
this
a
lot
the
more
subtle
flavors
played
well
with
each
other
and
none
dominate
id
get
this
again
if
it
was
brewed
i
was
reluctant
to
buy
the
four
pack
just
to
try
this
one
but
the
other
beers
in
it
are
so
great
i
actually
liked
lukcy
better
this
time
around
that
it
was
pretty
painless
great
four
pack
overall
drinkability
a
slow
sipping
beer
and
indeed
it
is
arrogant
bastard
with
a
bourbon
accent
one
is
enough
per
evening
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
but
to
my
surprise
this
beer
is
more
of
a
palate
wrecker
than
i
thought
it
would
be
arrogant
bastard
doesnt
tire
out
my
tastebuds
as
much
as
this
one
does
still
a
very
enjoyable
beer
though
o
wonder
what
some
aging
would
do
for
this
not
my
favorite
bastard
but
they
are
all
worth
a
try
overall
big
beer
thats
grown
on
me
since
my
first
sip
this
is
by
far
and
away
my
favorite
bourbon
barrel
beer
ive
had
thus
far
the
barrel
flavor
is
subtle
but
there
for
sure
and
that
is
definitely
a
plus
for
me
nice
added
complexity
to
my
surprise
i
am
very
much
enjoying
this
one
as
im
not
the
biggest
fan
of
spirit
barrel
aged
beers
id
definitely
recommend
at
least
trying
it
as
other
reviewers
have
pointed
out
this
is
far
from
being
a
bourbon
bomb
which
is
a
good
thingthe
subtle
barrelspirit
notes
a
bit
of
oak
some
vanilla
hints
of
toffee
brown
sugar
and
maybe
coconut
blend
really
nicely
into
the
background
of
the
standard
arrogant
bastard
profile
while
i
could
see
a
more
barrelforward
brew
being
just
as
complex
it
could
just
as
easily
suffer
and
become
onedimensional
in
the
increasingly
crowded
field
of
barrelaged
everything
stone
once
again
proves
that
they
can
set
themselves
apart
and
do
something
interesting
bomber
from
the
bastard
box
set
i
havent
checked
others
reviews
but
i
imagine
there
may
be
issues
with
the
lack
of
an
overwhelming
bourbon
presence
i
actually
like
the
subtler
approach
and
that
i
can
still
taste
the
malty
red
qualities
good
stuff
overall
i
was
expecting
a
lot
more
out
of
this
the
barrel
aging
is
too
subtle
and
the
beer
isnt
strong
enough
to
stand
up
to
it
which
is
too
bad
since
if
it
was
stronger
it
could
really
accentuate
the
flavor
profile
charge
us
an
extra
four
bucks
and
barrel
age
the
x2
bastard
next
time
also
bomber
mixpack
only
beers
suck
cut
that
shit
out
stone
yeah
its
cheaper
than
buying
them
individually
but
i
could
have
bought
the
other
three
separately
and
frankly
this
single
beer
is
way
too
mediocre
to
commit
25
to
i
am
all
over
the
place
on
this
one
honestly
not
really
sure
what
to
think
i
know
real
helpful
huh
from
a
bourbon
aged
standpoint
i
am
not
impressed
much
it
does
seem
to
give
it
a
much
smoother
mellow
feel
but
the
flavor
is
very
faint
much
more
noticeable
in
the
aroma
there
is
a
little
wood
flavor
and
some
burn
as
it
gets
warm
but
i
think
it
is
drowned
out
by
the
hop
profile
it
is
slightly
sour
too
like
raisins
some
caramel
malts
and
much
more
muted
hops
than
any
of
the
other
bastards
i
definitely
like
it
more
than
regular
arrogant
but
not
sure
if
i
prefer
over
oaked
other
than
the
feel
i
would
describe
it
as
a
cross
between
an
american
barley
wine
and
an
old
ale
very
good
overall
o
an
excellent
barrel
aged
ale
presents
like
an
english
old
ale
or
the
like
full
of
rustic
charm
and
bitter
hops
mildly
sweet
and
very
drinkable
a
good
barrel
that
is
woody
but
not
like
a
2x4
smooth
yet
fresh
feeling
oak
the
essence
of
arrogance
balances
this
out
and
overall
its
a
smooth
flavorful
beast
22oz
bottle
from
the
new
bastard
four
pack
which
is
a
great
deal
at
22
looks
pretty
much
like
standard
arrogant
bastard
aroma
is
a
very
nice
bourbon
and
oak
aroma
flavor
is
good
basically
ab
with
a
touch
of
bourbon
but
for
me
its
a
little
too
thin
bourbon
barrel
aged
double
bastard
would
probably
work
a
lot
better
another
sweet
addition
to
the
bastard
series
you
are
truly
lucky
if
you
happen
to
find
this
exceptional
ipa
on
draft
smooth
and
strong
with
a
great
tasting
hop
bitterness
that
lingers
on
the
palate
this
beer
had
glimmers
of
promise
but
just
finished
too
bitter
there
were
moments
that
hinted
at
the
sweet
decadence
of
a
double
bastard
but
the
bitterness
was
a
bit
too
abrasive
for
the
style
still
an
enjoyable
beer
had
it
on
draft
as
part
of
a
flight
served
in
a
craft
pub
glass
beer
pours
deep
and
coppery
in
color
with
a
lighter
substantial
head
smells
like

bomb
and
a
little
bit
oaky
imperial
red
ale
perhaps
of
course
drinking
more
than
two
months
after
stones
stated
expiration
date
will
do
bad
things
to
the
promised
dry
hopping
the
flavor
however
still
carries
a
load
of
west
coast
style
hops
too
much
even
for
the
rather
aggressive
malt
bill
full
of
bronze
barley
malt
the
fractional
dosage
of
oak
barreling
adds
a
really
nice
touch
and
survives
in
the
palate
despite
the
strength
of
the
other
flavors
nice

i
find
it
to
be
very
harsh
and
difficult

down

i
love
the
bottle
and
the
hype
they
build
in

the
bottles
so
i
was
really
wanting
to
like
this
one
and
the
original

while
i
appreciate
the
complexity
and
cleanliness
of
both

cant

maybe
some
vanilla
the
alcohol
content
is
evident
overall
i
like
the
other
variations
a
bit
better
very
good
i
thought
there
would
be
more
of
a
hops
taste
but
still
a
really
good
beer
on
tap
at
baileys
taproom
in
portland
or
i
always
feel
weird
ordering
californian
beers
in
portland
but
i
had
to
try
this
when
it
was
available
not
my
favorite
style
but
certainly
a
good
beer
to
warm
the
belly
on
a
chilly
night
more
memorable
than
arrogant
bastard
for
me
but
would
like
to
do
a
side

side
3
bastards
mixed
all
together

drank
over

this
is
amazing
i
need
more
of

tasty
a
crisp
aggressive
ale
blend
very
pleased
overall
a
bit
more
viscosity
and
you
have
yourself
a
masterpiece
speaking
subjectively
this
beer
more
than
encompasses
and
harmonizes
my
favorite
elements
of
the
moment
bright
hops
and
sweethearty
melanoidins
i
will
be
seeking
out
this
beer
like
a
fox
0not
as
complex
as
i
had
hoped
but
nothing
wrong
with
this
piney
strong
ale
offering
from
stone
awesome
offering
from
stone
might
be
my
favorite
ever
from
them
o
some
of
the
lovely
things
about
the
the
individual
brews
get
lost
when
mixed
together
but
overall
a
nice
blend
and
a
pleasant
beer
both
the
aroma
and
the
flavor
have
depth
and
the
flavor
has
admirable
complexity
the
aroma
has
pronounced
caramel
and
vanilla
notes
and
seems
to
hint
that
the
flavor
might
disappoint
but
it
does
not
there
are
suggestions
of
oak
toffee
vanilla
and
dark
fruits
but
nothing
to
mask
the
solid
malt
base
this
tastes
really
hoppy
malty
and
crisp
sort
of
tastes
like
a
very
hoppy
and
dark
hopageddon
but
a
lot
higher
quality
i
would
prefer
this
over
double
bastard
this
beer
is
over
done
and
over
rated
the
mouth
feel
is
best
described
as
sticky
and
it
leaves
a
sugar
residue
on
the
lips
and
pallet
if
is
not
crisp
as
this

dictates

all
the

the

so
this
becomes
a
dangerously

would

smells
like
a
standard

strong

without

herein
however
it
should
be
noted
that
the
nose
continues
to
evolve

intensify
as
this

warms
closer

the
end

is
a

potent

not
a

by
any

not
remarkable
different
from
any

the
three
constituents
which
make
it
up
i
would
opt
for
any
this
brews
parents
over
this
when
provided
the
option
favorite
of
the
arrogant

cousins
ive
tried

poured
a

with
a
large

foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
good
lacing
aroma
of
oak
with
some
residual
sugar
notes
and
strong
hoppy
notes
of
citrus
and
earthy

taste
is
also
dominated
by
oak
notes
with
plenty
of
residual
sugars
and
strong

with
light
oak
in

body
is
full
enough
for
style
with
good
carbonation
and
no

good
stuff
overall
and
very
enjoyable

like
all
of
the
bastard
versions
ive
tried

o
the
best
of
the
bastards
for
sure
this
one
is
much
smoother
and
didnt
take
my
head
off
like
the
double
bastard
terrific
fresh
recommended
overall
this
is
one
complex
bastard
rjt
nice
blend
of
bastards
more
floral
than
double
bastard
with
a
good
heap
of
hop
bitterness
o
this
might
be
the
best
of
the
bunch
i
want
to
say
that
it
is
definitely
the
hoppiest
one
the
double
bastard
probably
beats
it
for
aging
but
who
can
beat
a
premade
brewery
cuvee
the
earthy
and
cedar
hops
come
across
more
vibrantly
in
the
flavor
with
a
roasted
malt
undercurrent
somewhat
bitter
finale
more
drinkable
than
i
expected
overall
hard
to
describe
but
very
good
i
like
it
a
bit
more
than
arrogant
bastard
some
of
the
flavors
are
toned
down
in
favor
of
wood
and
hops
overall
a
very
enjoyable
variant
from
the
bastard
series
that
certainly
has
to
be
enjoyed
fresh
i
personally
like
how
clean
it
finishes
relative
the
to
resin
hop
flavors
present
the
best
o
unsurprisingly
hopforward
stone
remains
unapologetic
for
what
they
are
and
what
they
do
and
this
beer
represents
that
quite
well
love
them
or
hate
them
they
are
here
to
stay
and
you
might
as
well
get
around
to
trying
their
brews
even
if
youre
like
me
and
dont
get
their
beers
in
wisconsin
100
better
than
fat
tire
with
a
less
than
desirable
finish
do
drinkability
is
moderate
since
this
is
such
a
big
foreboding
beer
that
comment
may
be
made
about
all
of
the
bastard
line
overall
this
is
a
classic
beer
and
i
enjoy
that
the
brewers
created
this
blend
in
celebration
of
abs

this
is

beer
overall
i
was
a
tiny
bit
disappointed
i
think
regular
arrogant

is
a
tiny
bit
better
which
still
leaves
this
beer
in
the
upper
echelon
of
beers
just
to
confirm
my
review
i
also
found
it
on
tap
6
for
10
oz
jeez
and
still
prefer
arrogant
if
just
by
a
little
bit
its
great
but
in
my
opinion
arrogant
still
is
a
bit
more
balanced
am
i
sad
i
bought
it
hell
no
and
everybody
who
likes
hoppy
rich
beers
should
give
it
a
try
kind
of
smells
like
pineapple
juice
finishes
really
dry
big
sweet

character
balanced
pretty
well
with
the
dry

as
well
as
the

still
pretty

got
this
in
a

which
is
a
great
deal
4

get
the

if
you
can
find
it
and
compare

o

pulls
this
off
every
time
its
a
fine
beer
for
friday
night
or
monday
afternoon
with
dinner
or
afterward
with
cigars
the
nose
on
this
might
be
even
better
that
the
taste
this
remains
an
excellent
offering
but
id
rather
drink
an
oaked
or
double
as
a
standalone
rather
than
as
part
of
this
blend
o
this
is
a
stupidly
thick
resin
bomb
i
love
it
but
if
you
arent
ready
to
have
your
hops
ripped
apart
id
skip
it
if
you
are
looking
for
fruity
or
delicate
this
is
not
it
this
is
brutal
and
beautiful
while
it

up

the

following
on
the

mouthfeel
is
thin
to
medium
but
it
coats
the
tongue
nicely
making
you
continually
want
more
overall
this
one
is
quite
nice
with
a
lot
going
on
quite
a
nice
melange
of
flavors
blending
into
a
great
brew
overall
what
a
badass
beer
stone
killed
this
one
the
flavor
is
deep
complex
and
comes
in
waves
the
massive
hopping
really
cuts
through
the
mix
yet
blends
and
complements
the
other
flavors
instead
of
clashing
a
masterfully
crafted
brew
and
one
of
the
better
brews
ive
had
in
quite
a
while
yeah
yummy
o
delicious
and
a
great
mix
of
the
various
ab
into
a
single
rock
solid
brew
drink
it
quick
because
even
over
a
couple
weeks
the
amount
of
bright
fruit
in
the
hops
has
faded
a
touch
but
get
your
hands
this
if
you
can
because
it
is
worth
your
time
really
amazing
new
to
tasting

of

in
this
but
i
can
tell
it
is
a
blend
and
its
nicely
done
as

an

of

malt
and

the
flavor
is
jam
packed
with
a

interplay
between
cereal
grain
maltiness
and
citrus
hops
the
cereal
grains
start
in
the
front
of
the
palate
the
mouth
is
moderately
carbonated
and
a
bit
sticky
this
beer
was
poured
from
a
22oz
bottle
into
a
blind
pig
mug
and
enjoyed
at
apx
60f
the
flavor
is
far
more
hop
forward
as
this
is
a
strong
ale
a
bit
of
malt
supports
the
backdrop
but
a
herbal
floral
hop
sets
bravely
at
the
forefront
this
is
very
good
but
simply
doesnt
distinguish
itself
from
the
rest
of
stones
repertoire
really
enjoyable
you
feel
like
a
lucky
bastard
when
you
buy
this
thing
and
it
does
not
disappoint
it
is
strong
but
not
an
overpowering
ale
you
can
still
make
out
the
wonderful
mix
of
flavors
and
it
continues
to
taste
great
until
the
last
swig
o
a
well
balanced
strong
ale
that
is
quite
drinkable
for
8
5
not
bad
but
the
mix
of
3
beers
is
a
bit
too
ambitious
and
seems
to
create
an
almost
volcanic
eruption
of
flavors
o
this
is
definetly
my
favorite
of
the
bastards
the
flavors
are
very
well
rounded
very
solid
beer
deep
ruby
red
with
a
heavy
garnett
orange
hue
and
good
clarity
poured
with
a
thick
rich
light
beige
foam
that
quickly
reduced
to
a
soapy
cap
an
array
of
aromas
over
ripe
citrus
orange
and
pineapple
vanilla
sweet
dark
fruit
herbal
hops
funky
yeast
and
caramel
malt
medium
bodied
with
lazy
yet
incredibly
rich
carbonation
through
the
middle
tangy
minty
and
ripe
citrus
hop
flavors
with
smooth
vanilla
sweet
maltiness
throughout
herbal
and
citrus
hops
give
way
to
emerging
pine
hoppiness
from
the
middle
to
the
end
finished
semidry
with
a
slightly
subdued
lingering
pine
hop
bitterness
the
bastards
belong
in
the
their
own
category
overall
coming
into
this
brew
ive
had
good
expectations
i
really
enjoy
the
limited
releases
by
stone
this
was
a
really
interesting
find
and
i
was
a
little
hesitant
upon
seeing
it
was
a
blend
of
three
of
arrogant
bastards
styles
but
everything
blended
together
nice
and
very
balanced
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
to
a
friend
and
would
most
likely
try
again
cheers
m
a
little
syrupy
medium
carbonation
sticky
finish
o
a
hell
of
a
beer
it
strikes
a
perfect
balance
between
the
beers
blended
to
make
it
while
still
maintaining
the
overthetop
character
of
stones
flagship
mouthfeel
super
sticky
with
a
boozy
tingle
definitely
one
of
the
top
5
most
unique
beers
ive
ever
had
the
blending
presents
a
lot
of
flavor
interchange
floralsweet
fruitsresinleatheroakcaramelvanilla
flavors
opened
as
the
beer
warmed
this
one
has
me
interested
in
trying
their
db
edit
letting
the
beer
warm
a
bit
mellowed
out
the
flavors
very
nicely
this
beer
seemed
to
be
much
more
tame
than
the
double
bastard
and
have
more
character
than
the
dirty
bastard
an
excellent
ale
smooth
very
smooth
for
an
8
5
abv
this
dry
hopped
bastard
boarders
on
being
an
ipa
as
a
friend
said
he
assumed
upon
tasting
it
nice
brownamber
color
with
a
2
finger
head
when
poured
into
a
pint
glass
get
the
hops
and
several
fruit
notes
on
the
nose
grapefruit
maybe
cherry
the
taste
is
very
hoppy
with
a
smooth
finish
of
some
nutty
or
typical
brown
characteristics
again
the
beer
is
smooth
with
very
good
body
lacing
is
consistent
down
the
glass
lasting
well
after
i
finish
hope
i
get
lukcy
again
sometime
soon
overall
i
was
lucky
to
even
grab
two
bottles
of
this
at
my
local
retailer
and
another
as
a
gift
this
brew
absolutely
delivered
salud
very
enjoyable
could
see
grabbing
a
few
more
pours
out
a
deep
clear
brown
with
a
slight
ruddy
tint
the
almostwhite
head
is
thin
and
then
disappears
to
almost
nothing
and
yet
it
still
leaves
nice
small
sticky
lacing
the
aroma
is
woody
with
light
hints
of
caramel
sweetness
and
a
little
floral
hops
the
taste
is
delicious
but
changes
slightly
with
each
sip
with
some
oaky
some
more
maltforward
and
others
more
aggressively
hops
it
has
a
nice
weight
and
smooth
feel
with
a
big
bite
at
the
finish
mouth
feel
is
very
nicely
carbonated
just
perfect
very
enjoyable
anyway
its
an
awesome
beer
so
far
my
favorite
of
the
stone
4pk
on
to
the
bba
i
get
a
hint
of
the
familiar
bastard
taste
behind
a
flavorful
rush
of
citrusy
and
piny
hops
o
a
barleywinish
mixture
of
other
stone
brews
i
understand
which
is
refreshing
but
the
sourness
is
a
bit
offputting
for
me
any
anticipated
smokiness
or
oakiness
is
masked
completely
by
the
fruitiness
almost
as
though
they
mixed
the
brew
with
fruit
cup
juice
which
is
odd
considering
its
a
mix
of
three
other
stone
brews
to
which
i
have
given
higher
marks
overall
the
conglomeration
of
ab
oaked
ab
and
db
tastes
exactly
as
imagined
a
bastardly
blend
of
those
bastard
beers
a
plethora
of
depth
in
flavor
that
would
excite
even
the
most
advanced
beer
drinkers
if
you
have
a
costco
near
you
go
go
now
the
15
bastard
box
is
the
steal
of
the
year
notes
ive
loved
anything
related
to
arrogant
bastard
they
just
havent
messed
this
one
up
another
twist
on
an
old
favorite
overall
im
not
a
big
fan
of
the
bastard
series
on
the
whole
but
this
is
a
good
option
for
the
hop
heads
in
the
crowd
the
dry
hopping
is
easily
noticeable
in
addition
to
the
stronger
malt
aspects
of
the
base
beer
this
is
a
good
brew
in
terms
of
taste
smell
and
feel
but
the
look
of
this
beer
is
really
beautiful
in
the
glass
odd
staleness
in
the
body
not
unpleasant
but
unexpected
lingering
hop
finish
not
a
big
stone
fan
because
my
experience
makes
them
seem
over
rated
for
the
price
point
but
this
brewski
is
pretty
good
these
bastards
are
a
nice
ok
a
not
nice
bundle
and
they
should
sell
a
lot
of
these
to
people
making
a
bad
holiday
statement
o
this
beer
is
definitely
a
favorite
very
smooth
powerful
beer
that
balances
a
lot
of
different
elements
very
well
in
doing
so
it
completely
kills
the
palate
in
a
good
way
the
hops
dominate
this
beer
and
it
seems
more
like
a
dipa
than
a
strong
ale
you
get
the
oak
and
you
get
the
sweet
malt
the
hops
provide
a
nice
balance
and
i
get
a
bitter
grapefruit
from
the
hops
this
strong
ale
from
stone
bursts
with
a
big
hop
profile
and
a
sticky
bitterness
that
lasts
nothing
weak
here
while
the
hops
certainly
play
a
lead
role
the
malt
backbone
also
comes
through
on
the
back
end
banana
toast
rind
and
just
a
touch
of
tobacco
can
be
picked
up
truly
a
beer
that
sets
itself
apart
from
the
pack
overall
a
neat
idea
of
a
beer
and
great
taste
i
am
pretty
sure
i
can
detect
each
of
the
three
original
brews
and
would
love
to
catch
this
on
draft
a
fnei
boj

pterty

the
lukcy
basartds
bottle
from
tipples
dated

and
poured
on

pours
beautiful
amber
red
with
a
big
fluffy
off
white
to
light
khaki
head
with
some
yellowish
hue
aroma
is
like
sticking
my
face
in
a
bag
of
raw
hops
lemon
peel
soapiness
grass
flavor
is
super
sweet
maltiness
but
not
particularly
heavy
big
vegetal
hops
but
not
particularly
bitter
caramel
biscuity
malts
oak
a
bit
of
a
lemony
pinesol
note
here
and
the
malts
are
on
the
bland
side
medium
plus
body
dry
as
expected
for
a
bastard
with
medium
low
carbonation
not
so
sure
im
into
this
one
as
it
lacks
both
the
the
bitterness
and
the
heavy
malt
profile
of
bastard
seems
on
the
watered
down
side
flavor
wise
its
pretty
decent
but
just
falls
incredibly
flat
for
me
huh
1010
this
is
a
damn
good
beer
its
roasty
hoppy
malty
and
everything
in
between
the
complexity
woes
me
and
im
still
trying
to
process
all
of
the
diverse
flavors
a
in
my
book
the
beer
pours
a
nice
tannish
and
caramel
colored
head
that
takes
a
while
to
dissipate
the
beer
itself
is
a
clear
brown
and
dark
ruby
color
that
gives
it
a
very
heavy
appearance
the
beer
smell
has
strong
dry
hopped
notes
and
its
those
notes
that
tend
to
dominate
the
nose
the
beer
has
other
notes
such
as
a
strong
pine
smell
independent
from
the
dry
hopped
pine
the
nondry
hopped
smell
smells
much
deeper
richer
and
subdued
than
the
dry
hopped
smell
the
smell
has
strong
oak
notes
that
mix
well
with
the
hops
the
oak
and
the
hops
combine
to
make
a
very
interesting
forest
smell
that
is
fairly
aromatic
and
pleasing
the
taste
has
much
of
the
same
notes
and
the
smell
translates
very
well
the
oak
and
hops
become
more
woody
while
the
dry
hops
are
less
present
than
in
the
smell
the
taste
also
has
a
slight
caramel
taste
to
take
the
edge
off
of
the
hoppiness
the
mouthfeel
is
heavy
bodied
but
feels
lighter
with
all
the
carbonation
the
beer
is
fairly
smooth
though
overall
a
very
good
beer
and
one
worth
getting
while
its
available
in
stores
othis
is
a
solid
strong
ale
it
is
one
of
the
more
drinkable
strong
ales
ive
had
good
deal
in
the
stone
bomber
4pack
overall
an
excellent
beer
of
incredible
balance
i
cant
imagine
someone
with
a
reasonably
developed
palate
not
liking
this
beer
o
the
faded
hop
taste
throws
me
off
from
my
understanding
this
is
dry
hopped
i
wonder
if
the
oaked
aspect
is
messing
with
the
hops
dunno
good
and
surprisingly
cheap
at
my
local
shop
6
99
being
a
blend
of
beers
id
already
tried
i
wasnt
sure
how
distinctive
this
would
be
but
i
think
the
dryhopping
made
it
stand
out
truly
an
ale
worthy
of
being
associated
with
stones
prestigious
family
of
bastard
beers
it
is
the
progeny
of
tho
others
after
all
deep
ruby
color
with
nice
tan
head
that
disappears
quickly
smells
like
hops
a
lot
of
hops
tastes
like
hops
with
a
bit
of
barrel
aging
and
some
nice
maltiness
very
nice
beer
overall
while
i
have
always
personally
found
arrogant
bastard
to
be
a
little
overhyped
not
the
case
here
very
different
and
interesting
beer
almost
like
a
sexy
sophisticated
american
barleywine
had
a
baby
with
a
fined
tuned
athletic
world
class
dipa
and
sent
it
to
the
american
strong
ale
academy
for
gifted
beers
each
version
seems
to
get
even
better
if
this
were
in
12
oz
bottles
i
may
never
buy
oaked
again
d
highly
drinkable
a
dynamic
beer
pours
a
reddish
brown
with
a
creamy
one
finger
head
smell
is
very
hoppy
tangarine
bubble
gum
grapefruit
theres
an
oaky
presence
with
a
sweet
bread
malt
backbone
the
flavor
is
delicious
toffee
bubblegum
hop
bitterness
very
creamy
mouthfeel
quite
a
delicious
beer
the
beer
is
just
very
sweet
and
bitter
it
drinks
well
otherwise
but
those
are
huge
detractors
for
the
brew
this
beer
to
me
seems
like
an
uberhopped
imperial
red
ale
one
retaining
its
malty
red
flavors
while
displaying
an
uncontainable
amount
of
hops
its
good
bold
and
aggressive
o
its
definitely
a
good
beer
but
i
cant
say
that
i
prefer
this
blend
over
any
of
the
components
individually
especially
not
double
bastard
or
oaked
arrogant
certainly
a
worthy
drink
though
one
that
i
will
probably
have
again
in
the
future
4
o
really
dig
this
flavors
complex
intense
and
strong
very
dry
and
drinkable
overall
i
aged
this
one
for
quite
a
while
and
must
state
that
i
am
not
sure
the
waiting
was
worth
it
interesting
combination
of
flavors
thought
the
burnt
character
dominates
and
is
slightly
unpleasant
damn
good
this
takes
the
edges
off
some
of
the
other
bastards
in
a
really
great
way
its
got
a
deep
dark
red
color
richer
looking
than
the
others
with
a
full
inch
of
thick
off
white
head
it
smells
only
a
little
oaky
not
too
much
of
that
one
in
the
blend
i
dont
imagine
a
good
mix
of
the
sweet
red
malt
and
the
burnt
sugar
complex
of
the
other
ones
i
also
dont
get
an
obnoxious
amount
of
alcohol
which
i
kind
of
do
in
double
bastard
this
is
more
refined
more
nuanced
more
interesting
and
certainly
more
enjoyable
to
drink
than
even
the
classic
bastard
in
my
opinion
the
caramel
desserty
flavors
without
all
the
sugars
is
the
great
success
of
this
beer
and
the
layers
of
grain
are
also
beautiful
a
really
full
bodied
brew
a
tough
bomber
to
drink
alone
if
you
want
to
stay
coherent
at
least
and
a
great
long
aftertaste
filling
but
no
more
than
necessary
a
good
food
beer
too
this
worked
well
with
fresh
pheasant
stew
dont
know
if
they
made
this
more
than
once
or
not
but
i
would
try
it
again
thanks
a
lot
to
drlovemd87
for
hooking
it
up
atmosphere
is
good
foamy
head
consistent
coverage
pervasive
lacing
nose
is
roasted
malt
grains
accentuated
with
oak
molasses
honey
well
done
malty
with
plenty
of
molasses
and
peat
overall
this
is
a
great
quaff
from
my
tasting
notes
the
brew
poured
the
signature
bastard
deep
ruby
amber
color
with
an
off
white
head
that
lukcily
lingered
the
aroma
had
the
big
malt
and
hoppy
aroma
you
expect
with
a
bastard
with
more
of
the
arrogant
tones
showing
through
the
taste
was
great
it
was
all
of
the
bastards
in
one
place
giving
their
best
flavor
attributes
while
complementing
the
others
with
a
great
roasted
nuttiness
holding
it
all
together
i
detected
more
of
the
arrogant
flavors
which
held
their
own
alongside
the
dominate
double
while
the
thick
syrupy
mouthfeel
and
heavy
body
was
definitely
all
double
the
lucky
basartd
was
a
great
marriage
of
these
fantastic
stone
brews
that
created
a
basartd
of
its
own
o
i
like
arrogant
bastard
i
really
like
oaked
arrogant
bastard
and
i
love
double
bastard
what
happens
when
you
blend
the
three
somehow
something
even
better
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
emerges
this
beer
is
the
definition
of
smooth
the
flavors
blend
together
seamlessly
the
balance
is
perfect
and
its
heavenly
in
the
mouth
this
instantly
became
a
favorite
of
mine
o
the
idea
of
blending
all
of
the
different
bastard
ales
from
stone
is
an
interesting
one
and
the
resulting
beer
is
certainly
tough
to
classify
as
it
is
somewhere
between
an
ipadipa
and
strong
aleold
ale
there
is
a
fair
amount
of
complexity
to
the
flavors
which
when
combined
with
the
alcohol
presence
makes
this
a
beer
that
needs
to
be
sipped
slowly
this
beer
is
quite
bitter
o
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
another
great
beer
from
stone
this
poured
dark
with
a
ruby
hue
some
yeast
like
speckles
on
the
initial
pour
but
settles
down
clear
ample
off
white
head
that
dwindled
slowly
to
a
nice
ring
and
cap
excellent
retention
and
good
legs
nose
is
inviting
bitter
hops
grapefruit
with
sweet
malt
underneath
oaked
presence
off
the
nose
and
a
little
pine
hops
are
softer
on
the
nose
than
on
the
palate
slick
resiny
long
finish
but
slightly
wet
with
a
bitter
aftertaste
body
is
medium
heavy
a
touch
imbalanced
and
favors
the
sweet
aspect
of
the
malt
and
citrus
despite
the
abundance
of
bitterness
its
an
agreeable
contradiction
though
at
8
5
abv
d
this
is
a
delicious
beer
and
i
had
no
idea
what
to
expect
not
exactly
sessionable
but
a
great
beer
to
spend
an
evening
on
o
a
truly
great
beer
the
idea
of
blending
the
bastard
beers
together
to
create
something
completely
new
is
an
outstanding
thought
be
cautious
though
the
8
5
abv
with
show
you
what
a
bastard
it
can
be
the
next
day
o
this
beer
reminds
me
of
a
barleywine
i
was
surprised
by
the
sweet
smell
but
the
taste
was
more
what
i
expected
from
stone
i
wish
i
would
have
had
it
fresh
but
still
good
o
this
certainly
doesnt
seem
at
all
old
or
off
but
as
good
as
it
is
it
makes
me
want
to
try
one
out
in
date
well
done
stone
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
and
i
have
to
admit
i
was
sad
to
see
this
was
my
last
bottle
of
the
second
release
i
aged
one
9
months
and
didnt
think
it
was
worth
it
it
was
better
in
the
first
few
months
o
this
beer
is
like
smelling
salts
in
that
tasting
the
hop
bitterness
will
definitely
wake
you
up
but
theres
an
interesting
enough
mix
of
flavors
to
make
it
something
you
can
sip
and
savor
it
definitely
tastes
like
a
hybrid
between
an
imperial
ipa
and
a
strong
ale
hazy
deep
amber
just
over
one
finger
of
off
white
head
good
lace
on
the
glass
also
smell
is
piney
and
quite
hoppy
citrus
with
lots
of
orange
flavour
malt
caramel
with
a
faint
bit
of
vanilla
and
oak
taste
is
a
mix
of
caramel
malt
and
hops
lots
of
pine
and
citrus
fairly
bitter
throughout
oakvanilla
toasted
in
the
finish
mildly
sweet
but
drying
mid
palate
hoppy
aftertaste
medium
carbonation
perhaps
a
touch
high
medium
body
decent
feel
quite
a
nice
beer
very
drinkable
but
i
think
of
all
the
bastards
i
would
go
with
straight
up
arrogant
bastard
as
my
favourite
but
i
would
certainly
drink
this
again
45
the
lukcy
bastard
is
a
big
beer
and
reminded
me
of
a
good
scotch
ale
the
beer
poured
a
deep
rich
amber
with
thin
white
head
that
left
some
lacing
the
smell
was
mostly
malt
with
some
sweet
undertones
the
taste
was
heavy
with
malt
that
included
earthpeat
with
caramel
hints
and
alcohol
the
mouthfeel
was
full
body
with
smooth
carbonation
overall
it
was
a
good
beer
certainly
could
not
session
this
one
not
a
common
feature
of
stone
for
me
but
this
gets
better
as
it
warms
doesnt
hold
a
candle
to
ruination
but
the
oak
makes
this
better
than
your
average
bastard
this
beer
loses
what
it
gains
by
the
oak
with
the
idiotic
label
if
you
get
past
the
first
paragraph
without
a
headache
youre
the
better
man
overall
a
pretty
good
take
on
arrogant
bastard
family
of
beers
the
tropical
and
citrus
notes
really
set
it
apart
from
the
others
3
5
d
this
is
good
but
nearly
every
thing
stone
offers
has
been
eclipsed
hundreds
of
times
since
craft
beer
started
going
more
mainstream
and
showing
up
everywhere
this
is
an
excellent
beer
after
all
these
years
the
bastard
is
still
excellent
and
this
is
a
great
edition
of
it
delicious
and
well
worth
the
price
overall
a
fantastic
beer
a
bit
muddled
as
to
what
the
intention
is
otherwise
would
rate
higher
the
flavor
has
a
mellow
rounded
bitterness
with
a
piney
resiny
heft
to
the
body
with
a
dry
tacky
finish
its
malty
and
smooth
with
a
big
bitterness
like
its
siblings
only
without
the
sharp
edges
im
not
worthy
this
was
my
favorite
of
the
5
beers
i
sampled
while
at
stone
brewery
in
escondido
i
ended
up
buying
a
growler
full
of
it
when
i
left
the
american
strong
ale
is
to
the
imperial
double
ipa
what
round
table
pizza
is
to
the
best
italian
pizza
they
are
both
outstanding
but
the
strong
ale
just
adds
that
bold
american
touch
that
we
all
know
and
love
o
smell
delivers
taste
is
obscenely
good
bitter
malty
hoppy
goodness
pours
amber
with
golden
highlights
capped
by
a
light
beige
one
and
a
half
finger
head
great
retention
with
a
fair
amount
of
splotchy
lacing
toffee
citric
hops
and
some
underlying
toasted
oak
on
the
nose
fairly
complex
caramel
joined
by
orange
rind
charred
oak
burnt
toast
toffee
bitter
grapefruit
rind
and
warming
alcohol
fullbodied
smooth
and
silky
with
moderate
carbonation
a
successful
blend
of
all
of
stones
infamous
bastard
brews
overall
a
worthwhile
beer
something
i
will
try
again
for
sure
o
extremely
great
experience
with
this
beer
what
really
enhances
it
is
if
you
smell
the
beer
and
sip
it
at
the
same
time
you
can
really
emerce
yourself
in
this
beer
overall
crazy
smooth
and
really
easy
to
drink
if
you
get
a
chance
this
is
a
must
try
overall
this
is
my
favorite
of
the
bastard
line
really
so
much
going
on
here
and
i
really
love
the
oak
character
perfectly
blended
and
really
one
to
savor
overall
stone
seems
to
be
rehashing
old
ideas
but
with
brews
like
this
who
could
complain
i
think
i
prefer
the
original
bastards
especially
the
oaked
to
this
hybrid
but
it
can
still
be
considered
a
successful
experiment
i
hope
to
have
this
again
m
medium
body
understated
but
good
carbonation
finish
is
quite
clean
and
semidry
o
lucky
bastard
indeed
at
least
for
any
self
described
hopheads
this
beer
is
an
outstanding
huge
west
coast
tropicalcitrus
hop
bomb
medium
to
full
bodied
with
soft
carbonation
has
a
bit
of
a
sticky
feel
and
a
bittersweet
aftertaste
very
nicely
made
a
very
good
bastard
a
blend
that
worked
in
this
case
onice
combination
of
the
bastards
with
great
elements
of
each
blended
well
into
an
enjoyable
beer
to
savor
o
awesome
concept
with
equally
awesome
execution
to
me
the
oaked
bastard
really
shows
itself
fantastic
stuff
o
this
is
a
blend
of
stones
other
bastard
beers
original
oakaged
double
and
it
tastes
like
a
hybrid
with
an
interesting
blend
of
flavors
not
as
good
as
the
other
bastards
but
still
an
interesting
beer
that
packs
quite
a
punch
this
is
another
flavorfulcomplex
offering
from
stone
a
definite
slow
sipper
i
recommend
having
it
before
or
after
a
light
dinner
as
for
me
ill
probably
still
have
the
steak
tips
i
eat
too
much
too
much
dmb
overall
a
tasty
and
complex
strong
ale
nice
concoction
overall
this
beer
is
pretty
good
its
probably
the
most
inferior
of
all
the
bastards
but
its
a
bastard
none
the
less
and
still
better
than
a
lot
of
strong
ales
out
there
if
my
regular
store
has
any
left
ill
buy
some
more
in
any
case
im
glad
i
got
to
try
it
salud
really
nice
hoppy
spice
character
going
on
minimal
citrus
tones
with
a
fair
amount
of
pine
great
balance
even
though
its
pretty
powerful
and
robust
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
and
its
probably
one
of
the
coolest
bottle
designs
i
have
see
from
stone
so
far
one
bottle
consumed
body
is
medium
in
weight
carbonation
is
medium
to
highly
intense
at
first
coming
across
as
quite
prickly
but
gradually
generating
a
foamed
beer
across
the
palate
that
moves
easily
and
steadily
ethanol
burn
felt
on
the
tongue
and
back
of
throat
heat
felt
in
the
nostrils
not
wellhidden
makes
the
beer
less
enjoyable
closes
dryly
with
some
stickiness
across
the
palate
overall
this
is
a
solid
a
rated
brew

and
even

of

i

so
this
is
a
step
up
for

lacking

theres

is

stones

series
is
always
a

and
this
one
does
not
disappoint
while
excellent
im
not
seeing
much
difference
between
this
and
their
regular
arrogant
bastard
d
this
is
a
bruiser
of
a
brew
so
im
not
sure
how
drinkable
it
is
in
the
traditional
sense
but
it
still
tastes
fantastic
id
take
it
over
many
more
drinkable
beers
a
stand
up
strong
ale
im
glad
i
got
to
try
its
been
too
long
since
ive
had
the
various
versionsnormal
double
and
oak
so
i
cant
say
how
they
compare
despite
that
they
produce
a
very
tasty
hoppymalty
treat
d
a
tasty
beer
with
some
apparent
alcohol
and
some
heavy
bitterness
still
it
drinks
pretty
nice
for
one
of
the
beers
in
the
arrogant
bastard
series
very
drinkable
for
the
abv
and
the
persistent
bitterness
of
the
hops
i
would
like
to
see
this
one
come
back
from
the
bomber
to
a
pint
glass
pours
a
really
nice
deep
dark
red
with
a
very
nice
big
frothy
white
head
looks
amazing
the
head
starts
to
slowly
retreat
but
looks
as
though
its
going
to
stick
around
for
the
majority
of
the
drink
leaves
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
the
smell
right
away
is
hoppy
some
pine
a
hint
of
citrus
and
some
fruits
mainly
some
cherry
there
are
some
malt
aromas
mainly
in
the
background
there
is
some
caramel
as
far
as
taste
goes
its
pretty
comparable
to
the
smell
at
first
i
got
a
lot
of
malt
followed
by
a
nice
bitter
taste
from
the
hops
almost
a
lingering
sweetness
in
there
finishes
with
a
nice
hop
bite
kind
of
piney
in
a
way
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
above
average
by
no
means
thin
i
slightly
high
abv
but
a
couple
of
these
would
be
no
problem
very
tasty
and
the
alcohol
is
pretty
well
hidden
overall
i
wish
i
would
have
grabbed
another
one
or
two
an
interesting
blend
of
some
solid
stone
brews
definitely
wasnt
let
down
one
of
the
best
stones
i
have
had
notes
to
start
with
all
the
beers
that
were
blended
here
are
excellent
on
there
own
blended
together
they
work
well
with
each
other
and
other
a
new
excellent
and
complex
beer
the
hops
dont
pop
the
way
they
do
in
straightforward
dipas
including
stones
own
at
least
in
the
bottle
thats
more
or
less
expected
for
the
bastard
beers
id
be
interested
to
have
this
on
tap
in
bottles
i
suspect
it
will
take
on
more
complexity
with
a
few
years
as
the
bittering
drops
out
a
bit
mouthfeel
is
a
nicely
smooth
and
heavy
texture
that
while
pleasant
doesnt
do
anything
to
set
itself
apart
drinkability
is
enhanced
by
the
hops
cleaning
out
malt
tastes
a
good
deal
with
each
sip
i
could
see
the
bitterness
in
this
being
overwhelming
to
some
though
very
nice
mashup
of
beers
d
this
is
probably
my
2nd
favorite
of
the
bastards
behind
the
oaked
version
really
enjoyable
but
to
be
honest
im
not
sure
how
well
i
would
be
able
to
tell
this
from
regular
arrogant
bastard
enjoyed
the
pineapple
notes
deep
brownish
red
in
color
with
medium
to
light
carbonation
fair
head
retention
but
lots
of
lace
resinouscitrusy
aroma
with
a
good
amount
of
caramel
sweetness
soft
on
the
front
end
the
middle
starts
off
sweet
then
tons
of
hops
to
balance
satisfyingly
bitter
finish
medium
leaning
toward
heavy
body
wish
i
could
get
this
year
round
the
best
offering
ive
enjoyed
from
stone
in
years
highly
recommend
looking
to
stock
up
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
drinkability
was
pretty
good
it
had
some
very
nice
flavors
to
it
overall
very
nice
blend
of
all
the
bastards
cool
beer
and
a
very
enjoyable
one
as
well
d
this
is
a
wonderful
blended
beer
with
ample
dry
hops
and
a
solid
malt
profile
while
i
wouldnt
drink
a
whole
growler
to
the
dome
this
is
a
nice
one
to
have
in
the
mix
in
all
honesty
it
is
the
best
bastard
of
the
lot
d
i
had
a
22
and
could
easily
knock
off
a
couple
more
8
5
wasnt
a
problem
and
not
that
noticeable
if
i
see
more
of
this
i
will
buy
it
drinkability
its
very
drinkable
on
its
own
but
i
would
think
its
better
suited
with
food
as
it
packs
a
punch
d
this
is
right
up
my
alley
excellent
beer
d
great
beer
a
nice
representation
of
the
ab
line
of
beers
and
a
great
addition
really
hope
this
one
get
produced
in
the
future
as
expected
the
initial
taste
of
lukcy
basartd
is
kick
in
the
face
of
massive
resinypineycitrusy
american
hops
backed
up
with
strong
oak
wood
flavor
ive
always
found
the
bastard
beers
to
have
a
surprisingly
sweet
almost
fruity
malt
backbone
underpinning
the
big
hops
this
one
is
no
different
there
but
i
think
the
oak
helps
to
really
round
out
the
balance
between
the
malt
and
hops
great
beer
and
easily
the
best
by
far
of
the
bastards
i
love
stones
brews
drank
on
the
eve
of
february
8th
2011
watching
billy
gardells
stand
up
halftime
on
comedy
central
with
a
good
friend
of
mine
nice
appearance
nose
and
mouthfeel
drinkability
is
just
over
average
but
fits
well
with
the
arrogant
bastard
ale
series
drinkability
a
sipper
but
full
of
complexities
and
in
your
face
hoppiness
a
smooth
drink
taste
starts
malty
fruit
in
the
middle
and
closes
with
hoppy
bitterness
and
then
a
somewhat
harsh
alcohol
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
soft
over
the
tongue
yet
prickly
on
the
tastebuds
at
the
same
time
and
drinkability
is
not
so
great
the
aftertaste
that
stays
in
my
mouth
just
kills
it
for
me
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
good
kick
good
representation
of
style
although
this
is
a
blend
of
arrogant
bastard
oaked
arrogant
bastard
and
double
bastard
this
beer
tasted
a
lot
like
old
guardian
to
me
overall
its
a
good
beer
to
drink
for
a
while
but
not
as
good
as
any
of
the
other
four
beers
mentioned
d
very
drinkable
for
the
huge
blast
of
flavor
and
the
8
5
abv
very
delicious
a
great
take
on
the
arrogant
bastard
series
from
stone
d
goes
down
fairly
easy
for
an
8
5
flavors
are
very
strong
but
thats
to
be
expected
youve
gotta
be
a
bastard
to
drink
it
another
freaking
homerun
from
stone
absolutely
wonderful
brew
if
this
werent
a
specialty
brew
and
available
year
round
id
probably
always
have
it
at
my
disposal
dvery
drinkable
enjoyed
it
with
the
start
of
the
superbowl
cracked
this
at
a
party
with
several
beer
drinking
friends
it
quickly
erased
all
memories
of
beer
ingested
prior
to
it
because
of
an
intense
nose
super
boozy
flavor
and
a
warming
sensation
in
the
gut
the
more
it
was
consumed
seriously
this
is
beer
to
get
you
drunk
and
it
makes
no
bones
about
it
looks
like
alcohol
smells
like
alcohol
and
definitely
tastes
like
alcohol
however
sometimes
thats
what
you
want
a
strong
american
barleywine
style
knockout
punch
to
end
a
night
just
make
sure
there
is
a
comfortable
bed
nearby
if
you
do
more
than
1
of
these
beer
is
a
beautiful
mahogany
color
it
has
a
long
lasting
tan
head
consistency
is
awesome
and
leaves
a
curtain
of
lacing
nose
is
mostly
citrus
lots
of
grapefruit
to
start
its
a
little
sour
in
the
middle
and
you
get
some
sweet
caramel
notes
in
the
background
to
balance
it
out
a
little
the
taste
is
a
little
more
balanced
than
the
nose
you
still
get
the
citrus
hops
up
front
but
the
caramel
sweetness
is
more
pronounced
giving
it
better
balance
neither
aspect
so
far
is
complex
yet
both
are
spot
on
and
very
tasty
mouth
feel
somewhat
full
bodied
with
a
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
not
bad
seems
a
little
bit
thick
for
these
sort
of
flavors
its
a
sipper
for
sure
a
bomber
should
suffice
that
being
said
this
beer
has
good
carbonation
and
is
pretty
drinkable
for
the
size
i
just
wish
the
flavor
wasnt
masked
by
the
huge
booziness
loved
this
beer
my
favorite
in
the
bastard
series
easy
drinking
the
subdued
booze
helps
great
beer
hands
down
drinkabiliykeeps
me
coming
back
for
more
sips
tasty
and
drinkable
if
a
little
disappointing
i
was
expecting
something
other
than
a
tweaked
oaked
bastard
in
flavor
in
fact
i
might
like
it
a
little
less
than
plain
ol
oaked
bastard
drinkability
not
a
bad
tasting
brew
its
got
a
dry
bitterness
from
the
hops
which
i
like
and
a
decent
malt
profile
to
compliment
the
hops
i
feel
like
it
could
have
a
bit
more
complexity
and
oomph
but
its
not
a
bad
brew
im
glad
i
tried
it
and
i
wouldnt
turn
one
down
if
i
was
offered
one
but
i
dont
think
id
rush
out
to
pick
up
another
bottle
anytime
soon
drinkability
is
good
nice
balance
a
neat
blend
of
the
bastards
with
each
of
them
showing
itself
but
none
really
overpowering
good
stuff
pours
a
tawny
brownish
red
with
onefinger
with
a
lace
ring
around
glass
a
great
aroma
of
roasted
malts
a
little
biscuitybready
and
some
sweet
caramel
and
some
leafy
hop
bitterness
in
there
as
weel
first
thing
that
hits
me
is
a
bitter
hop
dryness
in
the
taste
then
the
malts
kick
comprising
most
of
the
medium
body
there
seems
to
be
a
plethora
of
malt
flavors
like
roasted
bitter
chocolate
toffee
a
butterysweet
sugary
sweetness
like
caramel
and
i
think
i
detect
hints
of
coffee
a
very
dy
finish
and
the
abv
bleeds
a
tad
but
this
is
a
good
sipper
i
was
almost
disappointed
with
this
from
my
first
glass
not
sure
why
maybe
because
i
got
better
head
on
the
second
one
but
the
second
was
a
knockout
for
me
the
first
disappointed
me
mostly
because
some
of
the
awesome
flavors
and
aromas
seemed
muted
surprisingly
i
dont
pick
up
any
oak
in
the
flavor
or
aroma
which
i
would
think
there
would
be
some
due
to
the
oaked
arrogant
bastard
in
there
definitely
is
better
than
regular
arrogant
bastard
but
im
not
sure
if
it
is
better
than
oaked
or
double
overall
i
really
enjoyed
it
great
until
the
last
sip
i
really
had
to
talk
myself
out
of
getting
another
since
they
did
such
as
great
job
of
hiding
that
abv
this
beer
would
be
great
with
dry
rubbed
ribs
or
pulled
pork
my
only
regret
with
this
is
i
only
bought
one
stone
is
hard
to
find
in
bc
and
i
might
not
have
a
second
for
a
while
oh
well
i
have
this
and
i
feel
like
a
lucky
bastard
a
really
nice
hop
treat
here
a
nice
dark
amberruby
color
smells
of
nice
oily
hops
and
some
ripe
citrus
the
flavor
is
at
first
a
strong
hop
hit
to
the
mouth
but
mellows
to
allow
for
another
sip
this
becomes
a
very
nice
session
beer
despite
the
high
abv
you
get
to
sample
all
of
the
best
of
the
three
stone
beers
in
each
sip
it
seems
each
one
keeps
the
other
from
taking
over
and
makes
this
brew
an
tasty
one
to
have
several
of
d
yes
drinkability
very
drinkable
from
my
stand
point
i
could
have
a
couple
bombers
in
a
night
and
be
very
happy
a
very
delicious
brew
from
stone
i
have
yet
to
be
disappointed
d
strong
lingering
bitterness
and
the
sweettoasty
flavor
combine
with
abv
limit
it
i
am
glad
im
splittling
this
bomber
verdict
lukcy
basartd
is
a
musttry
for
fans
of
stones
bastard
line
if
youre
familiar
with
these
beers
you
know
whats
to
be
found
here
but
this
blend
is
so
damn
tasty
it
easily
warrants
its
existence
nice
drink
ability
even
though
its
up
there
in
abv
cheers
mouthfeel
is
rich
the
heavy
duty
hoppiness
adds
crispness
pretty
tame
as
far
as
the
alcohol
presence
is
concerned
goes
down
very
nice
and
smooth
a
very
good
beer
that
i
will
drink
again
i
bought
two
bottles
excellent
hoppy
beer
pours
golden
with
a
foamy
half
inch
of
head
citrus
hop
aromas
aggressive
hops
that
are
muted
by
a
great
and
substantive
malting
citrus
and
light
fruity
tastes
oh
so
drinkable
the
hops
do
act
to
wear
down
the
taste
buds
somewhat
aroma
is
mainly
fruity
mostly
orange
and
slightly
sweet
there
is
also
a
hint
of
hops
it
pours
a
clear
dark
mahogany
that
is
more
brown
than
red
and
has
a
fairly
thick
pale
tan
head
that
leaves
some
good
lacing
flavor
is
quite
hoppy
with
tones
of
malt
and
citrus
and
just
a
little
bitterness
very
satisfying
texture
is
smooth
and
fizzy
leaving
a
nice
sour
citrus
and
hoppy
finish
doverall
very
very
drinkable
and
surprising
for
the
abv
a
great
concoction
from
stone
arrogant
bastard
fans
rejoice
d
good
drinkability
like
its
predecessor
it
can
be
easily
consumed
by
the
six
pack
once
one
obtains
the
appreciation
and
taste
for
its
so
called
arrogance
which
is
quite
smooth
and
lovely
for
the
hardcore
hophead
lucky
for
the
bomber
unlucky
i
didnt
buy
more
lukcy
basartd
is
an
excellent
beer
its
difficult
to
screw
up
when
youre
starting
with
components
such
as
arrogant
bastard
double
bastard
and
oaked
ab
having
said
that
this
is
truly
a
case
where
the
sum
is
less
than
its
parts
in
fact
its
a
little
less
than
each
of
its
individual
parts
but
given
stones
knack
for
creating
brilliance
this
is
still
fantastic
beer
go
out
and
grab
a
bottle
if
you
dont
like
it
well
youre
just
not
worthy
poured
into
my
big
duvel
glass
and
i
am
met
with
a
beautiful
burgandy
ale
which
looks
almost
too
good
to
drink
almost
big
frothy
head
with
staying
power
and
major
lacing
all
over
the
glass
the
combination
of
all
the
bastards
produces
a
citrus
little
orange
little
pineapple
piney
and
a
slight
floral
scent
i
would
have
a
liked
a
little
more
in
this
area
the
taste
is
bitter
up
front
followed
by
an
even
bitterer
if
thats
a
word
swallow
and
aftertaste
there
is
also
a
slight
grassy
taste
and
yellow
grapefruit
is
definitely
in
the
mix
well
done
the
combo
works
drinkability
is
good
although
the
flavor
will
knock
your
palate
around
and
kill
the
buds
after
awhile
the
bomber
i
consumed
was
perfect
for
the
session
but
anymore
would
be
overkill
in
my
opinion
overall
i
love
the
concept
of
combining
the
bastards
and
in
the
end
it
has
created
a
winner
easily
the
best
im
not
sure
how
its
possible
but
lukcy
basartd
seems
greater
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
oakier
than
oaked
arrogant
bastard
more
arrogant
than
the
normal
version
d
ive
been
taking
a
break
from
the
hoppier
side
of
things
and
im
thoroughly
enjoying
this
beer
goes
down
surprisingly
smooth
with
little
regard
to
the
abv
an
excellent
offering
d
very
good
but
a
little
sweeter
than
i
expected
going
in
would
definitely
buy
again
an
anniversary
bastard
is
a
great
idea
though
and
its
my
pleasure
to
add
lucky
to
the
beer
advocate
domain
can
i
please
enjoy
the
rest
of
my
beer
now
d
love
this
beer
wonderful
flavor
and
taste
definitely
would
drink
again
and
again
d
a
bit
sweeter
then
id
like
but
i
still
had
no
problem
finishing
my
half
of
the
22oz
while
not
my
favorite
of
the
line
that
would
go
to
regular
arrogant
bastard
this
was
a
fun
little
experiment
drinkability
split
this
with
a
friend
could
probably
drink
it
all
but
it
is
a
big
beer
an
interesting
concept
ive
also
had
the
sierra
nevada
anniversary
ale
based
on
a
similar
concept
both
are
good
and
interesting
but
i
tend
to
like
the
beers
on
their
own
better
still
solid
and
good
mouthfeeldrinkability
thick
feel
carbonation
is
good
full
bodied
a
nice
blend
of
beers
and
the
oak
aged
character
really
shines
through
quite
nice
this
is
medium
bodied
with
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
the
feel
of
this
brew
is
quite
oily
clingy
and
resinous
that
lasts
with
an
aggressive
bitterness
inside
the
mouth
this
brew
was
enjoyable
and
is
worth
a
try
but
i
would
say
this
experimentblend
is
one
of
those
cases
where
the
summation
is
not
greater
than
the
individual
parts
i
would
choose
this
brew
over
the
normal
bastard
but
not
the
oaked
or
double
version
dits
a
sipper
but
i
enjoyed
it
all
the
way
through
its
unique
so
i
do
want
to
have
it
again
d
ill
buy
this
one
again
if
i
get
a
chance
enjoyed
it
greatly
poured
from
a
22
oz
bomber
into
a
chalice
glass
this
pours
a
dark
ruby
with
a
very
full
creamy
and
thick
head
leaving
beautiful
lacing
behind
on
the
glass
the
aroma
has
a
somewhat
sweet
belgian
candy
character
citrus
fruits
like
grapefruit
and
soft
sweet
caramel
malts
and
a
bit
of
chocolate
in
the
nose
as
well
mouthfeel
is
farily
oily
and
coats
the
mouth
well
there
is
some
yeastsediments
floating
within
the
body
the
taste
is
complex
with
sweet
chocolate
and
caramel
malts
the
pine
and
sweet
citrus
comes
through
nicely
followed
by
a
bitter
and
dry
finish

nice
beer
to
commemorate
arrogant

quality
has
slipped
a
bit
this
year
overall
a
nice
beer
but
nothing
really
unexpected
if
youve
already
had
all
the
bastard
varieties
this
is
a
good
one
though
and
i
would
pick
it
up
if
it
is
available
to
you
cheers
a
well
made
and
very
nice
strong
ale
that
thinks
its
an
iipa
from
stone
a
must
try
d
incredibly
high
a
high
gravity
american
beer
that
destroys
any
other
beer
plans
you
have
for
the
evening
this
is
a
lot
and
this
is
also
a
blend
that
you
can
tell
is
exactly
all
three
of
the
bastards
together
a
board
range
of
interesting
hops
within
but
there
is
something
one
dimensional
in
its
intensity
pour
looks
like
a
imperial
ipa
but
that
distinction
with
this
style
is
questionable
so
sticky
sweet
malt
head
with
lace
amber
dark
but
well
filtered
nose
is
a
pounce
in
the
face
of
hops
as
expected
nice
and
forest
pine
palate
is
literally
a
blend
of
all
three
of
the
bastards
a
tad
warm
going
down
a
tad
syrupy
that
is
cut
like
a
knife
by
the
bitter
finish
palate
of
pineapple
brisk
coconut
woody
and
a
one
dimensional
hoppy
bitter
that
doesnt
have
anything
to
do
but
linger
and
in
that
distinction
transform
on
the
palate
over
time
as
you
drink
and
as
you
wait
the
several
hours
to
bet
your
taste
back
to
normal
ha
great
beer
but
a
sample
glass
at
best
overall
the
only
problem
with
this
beer
is
they
did
not
make
nearly
enough
of
it
i
wanted
to
go
and
get
another
bottle
but
i
got
the
last
bottle
damn
22
ounce
bottle
served
in
a
dfh
signature
glass
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
reddishcopper
color
with
about
an
inch
tan
head
head
retention
and
lacing
are
both
good
aroma
is
mostly
citrusy
grapefruit
orange
peel
and
pine
hops
along
with
some
caramel
malt
taste
is
citrusy
and
pine
hops
caramel
malt
and
some
vanilla
and
oak
not
surprisingly
theres
a
nice
lingering
bitter
hoppy
finish
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
creamy
and
a
bit
slick
with
good
carbonation
the
smoothness
of
this
brew
helps
make
the
drinkability
good
i
think
its
a
good
overall
brew
definitely
worth
a
try
with
that
being
said
i
like
the
other
bastards
more
than
this
one
it
was
still
a
cool
idea
to
blend
them
anyway
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
medium
density
understated
carbonation
nice
all
around
overall
a
very
solid
beer
but
i
have
to
say
i
was
expecting
a
bit
more
complexity
for
a
beer
that
seems
to
have
garnered
so
much
hype
the
sweet
caramel
malts
seem
to
dominate
this
beer
and
some
more
pronounced
hop
flavor
would
have
been
nice
the
oakaged
notes
were
also
hard
to
discern
which
was
disappointing
but
a
very
good
brew
nonetheless
and
at
11
for
a
bomber
it
was
pretty
reasonably
priced
good
but
not
anything
out
of
this
world
d
overall
lucky
bastard
is
a
solid
brew
happy
anniversary
to
the
bastard
d
good
and
complex
markedly
smoother
and
more
drinkable
than
the
others
in
the
series
d
great
beer
that
is
very
easy
to
drink
worth
seeking
out
for
sure
short
review
grandma
is
talking
this
is
a
great
beer
even
for
those
that
dont
like
the
bastards
pours
a
tarnished
copper
color
clear
with
yellowy
white
head
good
retention
and
lacing
scent
is
delicious
combination
of
aggressive
pacific
coast
hops
pine
and
grapefruit
and
balanced
sweetness
carmel
bread
brown
sugar
this
really
brings
the
components
together
nicely
aggressive
pine
and
grapefruit
as
noted
in
arrogant
bastard
full
notes
of
carmel
brown
sugar
and
bread
that
is
not
overly
sweet
from
the
double
bastard
and
a
smoothed
out
bitterness
from
the
oak
aged
fuller
side
of
medium
bodied
doesnt
appear
as
heavy
as
others
in
its
series
a
very
nice
blended
beer
where
each
of
its
parts
add
up
perfectly
d
not
particularly
balanced
but
drinkable
if
hops
are
your
thing
flavor
embodies
all
that
the
bastard
lineup
brings
to
the
table
aggressive
hops
but
a
superb
balance
of
thick
caramel
toffee
malts
the
oak
is
slight
and
thankfully
so
i
think
its
too
prominent
in
oaked
ab
lingering
hoppiness
suggests
pith
and
pine
great
carbonation
level
for
the
mediumthick
body
no
big
surprised
from
stone
here
but
despite
their
lack
of
creativity
you
have
to
commend
them
for
putting
out
consistently
goodtasting
relatively
affordable
releases
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
lots
of
active
carbonation
the
body
itself
is
smooth
where
flavors
are
harsh
that
creates
an
interesting
contrast
stone
is
not
afraid
to
challenge
their
drinkers
and
that
is
why
so
many
craft
beer
fans
love
them
i
have
had
all
three
of
the
base
beers
for
lukcy
basartd
in
the
past
blended
together
i
feel
that
the
double
bastard
is
the
dominant
beer
since
lukcy
basartd
is
a
one
shot
anniversary
beer
i
doubt
it
will
be
part
of
the
missouri
launch
however
i
do
anticipate
picking
up
the
other
bastards
d
very
easy
drinker
but
not
close
to
sessionable
a
true
palate
crusher
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thick
with
a
good
bit
of
carbonation
not
necessarily
my
ideal
sipper
beer
but
its
pretty
heavy
duty
and
will
stand
up
well
to
a
good
meaty
dinner
overall
a
decent
beer
better
than
i
anticipated
it
to
be
decent
drinkability
id
like
to
try
this
beer
next
to
bigfoot
barleywine
from
sierra
nevada
im
reminded
of
the
same
balance
of
huge
malt
and
huge
hops
heck
of
a
beer
22oz
bottle
served
in
my
old
stock
snifter
pours
the
color
and
clarity
of
unpasteurized
cider
with
a
loose
tancolored
head
that
quickly
dissipates
into
a
frothy
band
around
the
edges
and
a
cluster
of
bubbles
across
the
center
nose
expresses
dark
fruit
toasted
malts
a
trace
of
citrus
and
spice
and
a
hint
of
alcohol
and
wood
taste
consistent
with
nose
however
some
grapefruit
acidity
and
bitterness
also
comes
out
in
the
mix
before
finishing
with
a
light
lingering
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
with
an
assertive
carbonation
and
some
acidity
that
lightly
stimulates
the
salivary
glands
decent
but
not
sure
its
worth
the
hype
flavors
are
a
little
jagged
but
there
might
be
some
improvement
with
age
on
this
one
overall
this
is
a
pretty
badass
beer
definatly
a
sipper
but
an
easy
sipper
at
that
the
price
is
good
so
i
might
age
a
few
one
for
6
months
and
one
for
a
year
overall
very
good
beer
overall
as
usual
stone
doesnt
disappoint
this
is
definitely
worth
checking
out
22oz
bottle
poured
into
a
tulip
no
freshness
info
pours
clear
and
brownish
red
with
good
carbonation
evident
two
fingers
of
foam
good
lacing
great
nose
superbly
balanced
spicysweet
malt
and
fresh
lively
hops
very
complex
its
tough
for
me
to
pick
out
any
distinct
aromas
good
mouthfeel
full
bodied
but
a
nice
amount
of
carbonation
a
smooth
and
not
too
heavy
malt
infiltrates
the
palate
first
but
the
hops
are
fast
on
its
heels
the
two
end
up
mingling
in
a
very
unique
way
the
hops
come
through
at
the
end
but
arent
too
resiny
any
heavy
malt
is
wiped
away
and
the
finish
is
rather
crisp
and
clean
quite
drinkable
again
the
complexity
here
doesnt
allow
my
admittedly
dull
palate
to
pick
out
anything
distinct
but
it
is
very
enjoyable
definitely
a
different
experience
from
any
of
the
other
bastards
cheers
am
a
bit
fan
of
most
stone
beers
but
this
one
just
isnt
working
for
me
very
low
malt
aroma
significant
bitterness
which
is
mostly
herbal
deep
chocolate
and
candi
sugar
malt
some
dark
fruit
and
a
lasting
flat
bitterness
the
hop
aftertaste
is
somewhat
astringent
and
a
bit
unpleasant
for
what
would
otherwise
be
an
excellent
beer
great
mouthfeel
not
overly
heavy
sure
as
hell
not
light
about
as
good
as
it
gets
drinkability
is
good
too
bad
this
is
my
last
one
need
to
find
more
and
stock
them
away
for
safe
keeping
great
work
stone
one
of
my
personal
favorites
a
very
interesting
and
tasty
beer
might
be
a
good
one
to
age
too
great
balance
and
well
blended
alcohols
drinkability
it
was
very
good
i
will
be
trying
to
get
some
more
the
flavor
is
not
as
a
i
expected
really
more
malt
and
wood
giving
an
almost
balanced
flavor
to
the
high
alpha
hop
blast
the
sweetness
is
there
with
a
mild
berry
not
and
the
oakiness
is
very
substantial
with
the
tannic
quality
giving
a
vinous
accent
to
the
grapefruit
and
pine
from
the
hops
i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
it
evolved
quite
a
bit
from
straight
out
of
the
bottle
to
a
while
later
the
wood
is
strong
and
gives
slightly
green
element
which
makes
it
seem
kind
of
raw
at
first
and
the
flavor
doesnt
shy
away
it
is
appararent
this
is
a
strong
ale
with
the
8
5
not
hidden
really
i
liked
this
but
probably
would
not
seek
out
more
unless
i
was
jonesin
for
some
wood
flavored
beer
drinkability
highly
drinkable
for
an
8
5
strong
ale
though
i
admit
i
probably
would
not
want
to
quaff
two
bottles
of
this
in
a
row
d
could
almost
pound
this
very
balanced
flavor
overall
good
brewblend
wish
it
was
added
to
the
regular
bastard
line
up
d
this
is
a
bit
too
boozy
and
thick
and
it
takes
away
from
the
drinkability
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
but
i
think
it
was
a
pointless
idea
do
you
feel
lukcy
punk
well
do
you
a
strong
bitter
hoppy
nose
is
balanced
with
some
sweet
candylike
malts
i
can
pick
out
plum
and
dark
chocolate
it
smells
like
a
hoppy
port
the
flavor
reveals
a
big
malty
body
with
a
good
hop
character
it
isnt
as
overtly
bitter
as
arrogant
bastard
to
me
it
tastes
more
mature
and
complex
probably
because
i
know
its
a
blend
this
feels
like
a
sipper
to
me
mostly
because
of
the
complexities
in
it
not
because
of
the
alcohol
or
bitterness
ill
enjoy
this
22oz
bottle
over
a
nice
long
session
its
a
great
beer
to
relax
with
it
isnt
very
sticky
and
its
lower
carbonation
help
with
the
drinkability
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
ill
have
to
pick
up
another
bottle
if
i
see
one
lukcy
is
medium
bodied
with
some
nice
carbonation
the
biggest
problem
with
the
mouthfeel
and
even
to
some
extent
the
drinkability
and
taste
is
the
somewhat
watery
and
boozy
finish
to
me
this
experiment
resulted
in
a
new
bastard
without
the
best
qualities
of
the
other
three
drinkability
goes
down
easy
finishing
on
a
mellow
sweetness
encourages
one
to
take
another
sip
to
get
back
to
the
bitter
hops
i
could
see
this
getting
away
from
someone
if
they
werent
careful
also
could
be
used
to
get
a
brown
ale
drinker
come
to
the
hoppy
side
this
is
one
bad
mamajama
stone
talks
a
big
game
and
lukcy
basartd
backs
it
up
and
puts
you
in
your
place
for
ever
questioning
them
on
it
while
this
beer
may
set
literacy
back
a
few
pegs
the
base
beers
that
comprise
it
have
done
more
than
their
part
for
the
advocacy
and
advancement
of
characterful
and
stimulating
offerings
and
for
that
we
are
all
lukcy
d
this
is
about
what
i
would
expect
from
a
blend
of
the
various
bastards
the
hops
are
crushingly
bitter
and
full
of
peppery
pine
flavor
that
works
with
the
dark
malt
to
give
off
a
mustardy
barleywine
character
it
is
a
bit
on
the
harsh
size
in
the
aftertaste
with
both
acrid
bitterness
and
some
tannic
oak
notes
an
interesting
beer
but
when
it
comes
to
stones
beer
i
still
much
prefer
the
beers
that
dont
come
with
bastard
in
the
name
great
beer
from
stone
strong
flavored
brew
slightly
balanced
toward
the
hops
but
a
nicely
distinct
flavor
just
short
of
a
barleywine
although
it
was
a
bit
tiresome
by
the
end
drinkability
the
bitterness
and
alcohol
certainly
keeps
me
at
a
slow
tenuous
pace
a
nice
bitter
onebottle
diversion
to
while
away
the
hours
being
trapped
under
a
blanket
of
rare
atlanta
snow
this
beer
pours
a
copperish
amber
with
nice
fluffy
off
white
to
yellow
head
excellent
lacing
the
smell
is
very
similar
to
the
regular
arrogant
bastard
ab
with
grapefruit
and
pine
you
can
smell
some
of
the
sweet
malts
indicative
of
the
double
bastard
the
taste
is
of
all
three
beers
you
get
the
grapefruit
and
citrus
from
the
regular
hints
of
vanilla
and
oak
from
the
oaked
and
the
sweetness
from
the
double
this
beer
is
awesome
i
have
tried
it
on
tap
and
from
the
bottle
and
i
actually
prefer
the
tap
but
this
bottle
is
also
fantastic
good
beer
drinkability
i
only
was
able
to
get
one
bottle
of
this
so
far
but
i
sure
enjoyed
it
nice
concept
by
stone
and
i
wouldnt
be
against
this
being
an
annual
release
d
the
strong
taste
makes
it
hard
to
drink
more
than
a
bottle
in
a
sitting
but
i
keep
coming
back
this
is
my
third
bottle
pours
a
dark
amber
with
one
finger
foamy
off
white
head
thin
lacing
all
the
way
down
nose
is
big
on
hops
cirtus
and
pine
good
amount
of
bready
malts
too
auromas
of
the
oak
linger
taste
wise
this
is
a
well
balanced
beer
where
the
strongbarley
and
malts
dominate
the
flavour
profile
less
of
a
hop
bite
than
the
nose
would
lead
to
believe
but
certainly
some
lingeriing
in
the
finish
medium
to
heavy
mouthfeel
good
carbonation
present
this
is
a
delicious
brew
from
stone
glad
to
be
able
to
find
it
cool
bottle
design
and
jumbled
writing
style
unbelievably
smooth
on
the
palatte
such
an
easy
drinker
in
the
glass
lucky
bastard
looks
reddish
maroon
brown
with
a
light
tan
off
cream
looking
head
that
left
some
spots
on
the
glass
good
retention
looks
like
a
bastard
huge
amounts
of
malt
piled
on
top
of
a
heaping
of
that
signature
stone
hop
bouquete
oak
is
prominent
as
well
and
some
scent
of
vanilla
pungent
yet
sort
of
muddled
also
im
not
sure
the
yeast
strain
but
it
totally
kills
this
beer
for
me
in
all
the
bastards
ive
had
this
yeast
really
detracts
from
what
could
be
a
killer
set
of
beers
stone
knows
hops
the
yeast
should
be
re
evaluated
taste
is
the
faulty
for
me
yeast
on
top
of
a
oaked
bastard
double
bastard
and
a
arrogant
one
sorry
i
just
cant
get
past
the
yeast
on
this
one
nothing
more
to
add
except
that
the
body
is
strong
above
medium
not
at
all
hot
and
kinda
bitey
from
a
hopping
carb
is
no
problem
but
the
drinkability
is
sorry
another
quality
beer
from
stone
which
reminds
me
its
been
too
long
since
ive
had
my
favs
from
the
yearround
stone
lineup
ab
and
ruination
md
the
superior
resiny
characteristic
of
the
beer
lends
to
a
sublimely
smooth
nearly
syrupy
mouthcoat
yet
it
remains
lively
on
the
tongue
and
warms
all
the
way
down
one
of
the
better
brews
i
have
had
from
stone
in
a
while
well
done
a
beer
tongue
tosser
very
complex
bitter
sweet
finish
has
a
hoppy
smell
almost
herbal
color
is
reddish
brown
with
a
white
sudsy
head
taste
is
hoppy
with
some
cherry
hints
taste
is
good
but
it
bitterness
is
a
bit
overwhelming
had
a
sudsy
hoppy
feel
though
which
also
is
good
i
had
this
on
tap
a
few
weeks
ago
and
it
was
very
delicious
im
lucky
to
have
found
it
on
draft
and
bottle
here
man
this
beer
is
great
just
had
it
and
it
blew
me
and
my
friend
away
this
is
beer
is
the
definition
of
craft
beer
it
has
so
much
body
and
so
much
flavor
the
head
on
the
beer
is
just
like
a
arrogant
basterd
and
i
loved
that
the
color
is
a
dark
brown
amberish
color
for
an
american
strong
ale
this
is
top
of
the
line
i
loved
this
beer
910
mdl
medium
to
heavy
bodied
with
good
carbonation
overall
a
very
interesting
beer
the
bigger
body
makes
it
a
little
hard
to
drink
more
than
a
glass
i
like
that
the
oakwood
shines
through
a
little
bit
it
is
heavy
on
the
pine
flavor
but
that
should
be
expected
based
on
what
this
beer
is
a
combination
of
as
others
have
noted
would
have
liked
it
a
11
50
cheaper
bought
mine
for
7
50
overall
it
was
a
very
enjoyable
brew
i
hope
i
can
find
another
bottle
in
the
near
future
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
nice
balance
of
carbonation
fairly
smooth
overall
the
hops
are
a
little
overwhelming
in
this
one
i
can
drink
this
but
its
not
really
something
that
i
want
drink
a
lot
of
okay
to
drink
once
but
i
probably
wouldnt
pick
up
another
one
of
these
poured
on
tap
at
the
stone
brewery
into
a
pint
glass
this
beer
pours
a
cloudy
redamber
color
with
a
thin
rim
of
head
the
beer
has
a
hoppy
and
fruity
balanced
smell
on
the
nose
with
alcohol
undertones
the
beer
has
a
heavy
hop
and
alcohol
flavor
with
poor
balance
the
malt
flavors
are
forward
on
the
tongue
and
aftertaste
but
the
hop
flavor
is
everywhere
else
the
beer
has
a
very
sourbitter
aftertaste
the
beer
is
extremely
unique
and
surprisingly
drinkable
despite
the
odd
mix
and
off
balance
of
characteristics
d
very
high
esp
for
8
5
its
interesting
i
sort
of
expected
more
complexity
here
but
its
just
straightforward
and
good
astringent
bitter
big
and
a
punch
in
the
mouth
but
good
overall
a
very
solid
brew
d
would
really
have
liked
less
bittering
hops
and
a
more
complex
maltiness
increased
age
2
years
could
provide
some
necessary
oxidation
and
desired
sherry
notes
overall
not
bad
but
likely
to
skip

as
the

tastes
like
a

perhaps
its
reach
exceeds
its

d
moderate
an
enjoyable
beer
although
one
i
wont
rush
to
revisit
tasty
though
id
like
to
see
it
under
56
honestly
lots
going
on
here
but
the
mouthfeel
carbonation
drinkability
and
overall
texture
are
of
course
superb
as
befits
a
blend
of
the
three
bastards
while
time
has
definitely
caught
up
with
the
arrogant
bastard
rhetoric
im
more
than
happy
to
be
caught
drinking
one
whether
at
home
or
from
a
friendly
tap
brag
on
stone
very
easy
to
sip
but
easy
to
drink
faster
too
hides
the
alcohol
very
well
pours
a
ruby
brown
colour
that
is
somewhat
seethrough
thick
offwhite
head
with
nice
head
retention
leaves
small
rings
of
lacing
on
the
glass
smells
of
malty
caramel
citrus
hops
and
a
hint
of
the
oak
though
the
oak
is
very
mild
and
who
knows
if
i
would
pick
any
up
if
i
wasnt
told
the
oak
aged
was
blended
bitterness
hits
me
more
than
most
beers
that
are
this
malty
with
some
sweetness
more
in
the
aftertaste
smooth
carbonation
level
a
really
nice
beer
no
problem
at
all
to
polish
off
this
bomber
pours
a
great
thick
browncopper
color
with
great
head
and
excellent
leacing
it
has
a
huge
malty
scent
deep
thick
and
dark
along
with
a
nice
citrus
hop
edge
on
the
border
excellent
flavor
great
thick
malts
near
barleywine
in
depth
with
good
caramel
tones
and
a
wonderful
citrus
hop
finish
that
smoothed
everything
out
this
is
a
fantastic
brew
drinkability
relatively
so
honestly
i
would
rather
have
an
oab
than
this
d
the
hops
are
nice
and
full
but
take
on
more
of
a
pungent
bitterness
instead
of
having
a
full
flavor
the
malt
offers
some
nice
support
but
the
dandelion
bitterness
just
stained
my
tongue
without
offering
the
hop
aroma
and
flavor
to
support
it
malt
and
hops
mingle
nicely
on
the
tongue
trying
to
detect
some
oak
but
cant
an
astringent
short
finish
that
doesnt
really
invite
another
sip
the
whole
is
not
more
than
the
sum
of
the
parts
id
say
where
do
i
start
hmmm
lukcy
basartd
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
about
a
5
inch
white
head
scents
of
grapefruit
and
pine
are
all
over
the
place
stings
the
nostrils
beautifully
taste
is
of
a
earthy
pungent
citrus
with
some
pine
a
smack
to
the
palate
of
tasty
hops
mouthfeel
is
smooth
at
first
then
gives
a
kick
toward
the
back
end
drinkability
is
high
due
to
how
good
it
tastes
this
is
a
splendid
ale
o
this
seemed
more
like
a
gimmick
beer
when
i
first
heard
about
it
but
it
somehow
ends
up
being
better
than
its
component
beers
while
it
may
not
keep
well
over
time
im
still
tempted
to
go
buy
a
case
great
stuff
d
this
is
a
good
beer
not
great
and
not
an
anniversary
caliber
beer
by
any
means
good
experiment
worth
one
try
alcohol
is
well
hidden
but
like
all
the
bastards
carries
its
bitterness
like
a
battle
standard
nice
beer
for
a
glass
or
two
very
drinkable
but
not
the
most
amazing
thing
ive
ever
had
which
is
what
i
hear
alot
of
people
say
about
stone
i
thought
this
was
simply
a
good
beer
d
a
great
beer
that
i
wish
i
could
have
more
of
in
my
own
collection
the
melt
keg
has
already
blown
and
my
one
22
is
all
that
i
have
left
go
pick
this
up
if
you
see
it
on
the
shelf
you
wont
be
dissapointed
d
definitely
one
to
sip
and
enjoy
but
possible
to
have
a
few
in
an
evening
great
beer
and
one
that
i
recommend
to
anyone
that
appreciates
arrogant
bastard
the
aroma
is
strong
and
full
of
floral
and
citrus
hops
the
flavor
follows
in
line
with
the
other
bastard
ales
as
expected
with
strong
hop
bitterness
and
flavor
and
a
mild
malt
sweetness
for
balance
the
oak
cones
through
nicely
in
the
finish
and
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
mouthfeel
is
dry
and
carbonation
is
lively
this
is
a
nice
blend
of
the
better
qualities
of
each
beer

a
bomber
eh
not
a
great
deal
but
good
enough
i
guess
d
the
hops
are
a
little
overwhelming
in
this
one
i
can
drink
this
but
its
not
really
something
that
i
want
drink
a
lot
of
okay
to
drink
once
but
i
probably
wouldnt
pick
up
another

not
at

a
session
beer
but
this
is
a
great
sipping
and
savoring
beer
overall
a
very
solid
offering
here
and
glad
i
ha
the
chance
to
try
it
on
tap
the
palate
is
about
what
id
expect
from
a
blend
of
the
3
bastards
deep
caramel
malts
a
little
sugar
cookie
vanilla
astringent
oak

abrasive

what
it
is

d
a
nice
blend

the
three
some
nice

solid

characteristics
the
abv
is
hardly

is
a
great

very

like
quite
the
assertive

right
up

some
residual

but
hops
are
the
name
of
the
game
here
resiny

puckering

some

in

very
solid
beer
across
the
board
served
from

into
a
shaker
poured
redorange
with
a
one
finger
offwhite
head
that
subsided
to
a
half
finger
slowly
maintained
excellent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
massive
bitter
hop
oak
and
citrus
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
oak
big
bitter
hop
and
very
slight
citrus
it
had
a
medium
feel
on
the
palate
with
medium
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
nice
brew
this
one
was
pretty
well
balanced
as
well
for
a
hop
friendly
palate
i
could
see
this
one
being
too
hoppy
for
a
person
new
to
really
hoppy
brews
though
the
blend
of
the
brews
actually
turned
out
a
lot
nicer
than
i
was
expecting
them
to
this
one
is
a
definite
must
try
even
if
you
have
to
trade
for
it
d
surprisingly
easy
to
drink
but
didnt
get
much
of
the
double
bastard
in
it
pretty
tasty
stuff
glad
i
got
a
chance
to
try
it
really
need
to
get
around
to
trying
some
double
bastard
another
hit
from
stone
i
love
the
bastard
line
and
this
one
does
not
disappoint
medium
body
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
some
warming
alcohol
i
enjoyed
the
nose
but
the
dryness
took
away
from
things
a
bit
smells
like
fresh
cone
hops
with
a
sweet
cherry
grapefruit
like
smell
that
mixes
in
with
the
sweet
malt
the
taste
hits
you
with
sweet
on
the
tip
of
your
tongue
and
then
a
real
long
dry
bitter
finish
from
middle
to
end
i
love
hopped
up
west
coast
beers
you
can
always
count
on
them
to
have
that
extremely
fresh
resinous
green
hop
bitterness
it
just
tastes
so
fresh
because
of
this
this
would
be
extremely
hoppy
if
it
werent
for
the
sweet
malt
that
combines
with
an
oak
like
flavor
that
you
can
definitely
pick
up
the
combination
is
fantastic
it
really
is
an
ipa
without
being
an
ipa
but
with
more
malts
this
is
an
amazing
beer
and
it
combines
3
quality
beers
in
one
to
get
that
flavor
the
arrogant
bastard
ale
oaked
aged
arrogant
bastard
and
the
double
bastard
im
glad
they
came
up
with
this
idea
because
it
adds
for
a
really
complex
rich
tasting
beer
that
is
very
hoppy
resinous
and
piney
it
has
a
full
body
feel
and
since
you
can
taste
the
raw
hops
with
the
sweet
malt
the
alcohol
hardly
comes
through
for
8
5
what
an
amazing
beer
stone
never
fails
when
it
comes
to
top
notch
quality
beer
pours
a
rich
mahogany
brow
with
a
cream
white
head
that
does
seem
to
want
to
stick
around
for
long
it
appears
to
be
pretty
cloudy
too
hops
hops
hops
unfortunately
i
cant
seem
to
smell
much
this
has
the
signs
of
the
classic
bastard
flavor
the
first
sip
however
wasnt
as
strong
as
i
would
have
expect
rich
hop
flavor
earthy
chewy
definitely
a
woody
flavor
from
the
oak
aged
portion
notes
of
caramel
as
well
this
beer
starts
with
a
very
strong
hop
attack
very
bitter
almost
spicey
then
kind
of
fizzles
before
you
can
get
to
the
malt
and
some
other
hop
flavors
that
flavor
kinda
seems
to
pair
up
with
some
of
the
malt
theres
a
citrusmalt
finish
the
carbonation
keeps
things
moving
but
seems
a
little
too
much
only
because
i
like
my
strong
ales
with
a
little
less
carb
perhaps
its
a
way
to
keep
it
from
turning
into
a
malt
bomb
which
actually
now
that
i
think
about
it
saves
the
beer
overall
a
good
beer
to
have
tried
i
dont
think
blending
the
three
beers
made
a
difference
ive
had
all
the
different
versions
of
the
bastard
all
which
i
like
all
the
flavors
are
familiar
which
is
nice
but
blending
it
does
bring
anything
new
to
the
table
final
note
i
loved
this
beer
almost
two
times
more
than
the
double
bastard
in
a
way
the
db
was
way
too
malty
so
smooth
and
so
drinkable
d
this
is
a
good
drinkable
beer
but
it
just
makes
me
wish
i
was
drinking
a
double
bastard
honestly
d
this
beer
is
awesome
but
very
aggressive
on
the
taste
buds
and
cant
imagine
doing
more
than
one
bomber
in
an
evening
d
i
like
this
better
then
all
of
its
parts
go
figure
nice
strong
ale
blend
we
got
here
ill
keep
an
eye
out
for
a
bottle
to
lay
down
and
see
what
happens
with
some
time
mediumfull
body
with
some
chew
to
it
average
carbonation
very
very
solid
beer
though
for
my
money
not
big
drinkability
d
sipping
this
one
slowly
hard
not
to
there
is
so
much
going
on
here
that
each
sip
brings
on
something
new
as
it
warms
the
alcohol
becomes
a
bit
more
evident
making
it
even
more
of
a
sipper
d
this
had
a
very
nice
scent
and
taste
with
pretty
good
body
but
it
was
nothing
too
special
the
alcohol
was
well
hidden
but
the
lasting
bitterness
made
it
less
than
easy
to
drink
very
enjoyable
fresh
im
not
sure
if
age
would
help
improve
but
standard
double
bastard
is
still
probably
my
favorite
had
doubted
some
of
stones
new
beer
offerings
as
of
late
but
this
beer
restored
my
faith
that
they
can
make
a
quality
brew
chewy
body
thats
on
the
fuller
end
with
a
very
complex
flavor
profile
a
blast
of
bitter
earthy
and
sweet
citrus
hops
up
front
that
lingers
throughout
over
the
sweet
malt
backbone
into
a
slightly
dry
warm
finish
lots
of
earthy
pine
up
front
as
well
as
some
citrus
peel
and
grapefruit
im
actually
surprised
how
bitter
this
is
up
front
even
for
stone
this
is
countered
nicely
midpalate
by
a
sweet
caramel
malt
character
that
is
nice
and
toasty
with
hints
of
biscuit
oak
and
vanilla
the
hops
are
still
the
prominent
flavor
but
the
malt
and
oak
notes
provide
decent
balance
the
high
abv
is
well
masked
with
only
slight
warmth
in
the
finish
making
this
beast
very
quaffable
this
might
be
too
bitterhoppy
for
some
but
once
again
stone
has
impressed
me
d
only
improved
the
entire
time
it
was
open
bitterness
is
still
dominant
but
sweetness
has
risen
commensurately
as
it
warmed
good
depth
and
complexity
of
flavors
overall
a
great
beer
judging
by
the
abv
this
must
be
more
regular
bastard
than
double
but
the
oak
and
hops
are
a
great
blend
this
beer
was
dark
brown
and
had
a
tan
head
it
had
an
awesome
piney
hop
aroma
which
i
wasnt
expecting
this
years
double
bastard
was
very
bitter
but
didnt
have
as
much
hop
aroma
neither
did
the
oaked
or
the
regular
bastard
this
smelled
as
if
it
had
been
dry
hopped
after
it
was
blended
the
taste
was
more
hop
forward
but
overall
well
balanced
it
didnt
have
the
bitter
aftertaste
of
the
double
or
even
the
arrogant
bastard
the
blending
seems
to
have
mellowed
this
out
in
a
good
way
this
has
to
be
one
of
the
best
releases
stone
has
put
out
this
year
in
this
case
the
whole
was
greater
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
overall
this
brew
might
just
be
one
of
the
best
incarnations
of
the
bastard
ive
had
im
definitely
going
to
make
this
mix
at
home
after
my
stash
runs
dry
o
really
good
it
seems
to
be
like
the
perfect
synergy
of
these
three
beers
meeting
into
one
they
shouldve
named
it
voltron
im
a
double
bastard
man
myself
but
this
is
next
in
line
in
the
bloodline
of
the
bastards
beautiful

a
large
offwhite

earth
spices

thanks
to
my
wife
for
this
one
christmas
morning
beer
might
as
well
nothing
else
to
do
tastes
better
than
i
remember
regular
arrogant
bastard
and
much
hoppier
smells
wonderful
and
seems
like
a
great
strong
ale
hopped
up
more
than
usual
love
it
and
wish
it
comes
out
again
d
this
beer
is
phenomenal
in
my
book
and
blows
any
one
of
the
the
three
components
out
of
the
water
a
great
mix
that
i
hope
will
be
back
soon
and
often
more
interesting
than
any
of
the
base
beers
i
think
great
example
of
the
style
well
worth
picking
up
drinkability
a
great
cuvee
de
bastard
all
of
the
bastards
are
here
and
all
complement
each
other
well
which
is
to
be
expected
a
very
nice
brew
better
than
any
single
bastard
too
bad
it
will
only
be
around
for
a
short
time
get
this
while
you
can
i
preferred
each
of
this
beers
three
components
when
i
had
them
on
their
own
but
definitely
give
this
a
try
if
you
enjoyed
the
others
delicious
highly
recommendable
my
expectations
for
this
beer
may
have
been
a
bit
high
arrogant
bastard
oaked
arrogant
bastard
and
double
bastard
all
together
should
have
been
exponentially
fantastic
the
net
result
however
was
that
the
sum
was
less
than
the
parts
a
bit
tame
with
a
moderate
caramel
malt
note
and
hopping
that
seemed
a
bit
pedestrian
against
the
malt
definitely
a
nice
beer
as
with
the
base
beers
this
seems
to
have
lost
the
vibrancy
and
surprise
that
this
had
for
me
early
on
there
are
now
a
lot
of
beers
that
are
more
arrogant
which
works
with
the
superheavy
taste
banquet
the
drinkability
is
about
average
for
the
abv
creamy

aroma
is
big

from
the

held

knock
me
over
with
a
feather
i
understand
this
brew
is
a
combination
of
all

bastards
well

the
strong
backbone
of
malt
gives
it
balance
of
course
there
are
far
too
many
hop
astringencies
and
too
much
bitterness
for
it
to
shine
through
there

you
can
feel
it

really
interested
in
these
blended
beers
as
its
very
balanced
but
not
like
the
double
bastard
there
is
good
carbonation
dark
copper
body
with
a
full
pillowy
white
head
one
of
the
most
beautiful
looking
beers
ive
ever
laid
eyes
on
aromas
are
pine
cones
and
wood
the
flavours
also
feature
the
pine
and
oak
but
caramel
malts
are
shining
through
as
well
there
is
also
some
earthy
dankness
in
the
mix
a
dry
bitter
finish
rounds
out
the
pleasure
of
drinking
this
one
sucks
theyre
retiring
this
one
i
was
a
big
fan
of
this
beer
expected
more
from
this
beer
being
oaked
age
poured
light
body
smells
of
malts
and
oak
taste
is
thin
with
hints
of
vanilla
with
a
burn
from
the
alcohol
at
the
end
v
medium
i
stopped
drinking
this
after
the
price
increase
gosh
maybe
8
years
ago
now
found
it
on
tap
the
other
day
and
its
all
i
have
been
drinking
the
oak
flavors
elavate
the
arrogant
bastard
to
outstanding
heights
one
of
my
all
time
favorite
strong
ales
the
oaked
version
of
arrogant
bastard
has
just
a
hint
of
oak
under
tone
that
i
really
enjoy
12
oz
bottle
very
good
brew
not
quite
as
good
as
the
double
bastard
but
still
pretty
good
a
great
aged
brew
overall
i
like
this
better
than
the
original
the
oak
adds
a
lot
of
complexity
without
being
overpowering
a
really
fine
beer
overall
quite
bitter
and
dry
but
stimulating
and
flavorful
i
found
the
aroma
a
little
disappointing
but
was
otherwise
pleased
just
not
feelin
it
dawg
i
dont
like
the
flavor
of
it
struggling
to
finish
one
12oz
beer
glad
it
was
only
1
in
a
mixasix
o
a
little
mellower
than
regular
ab
but
a
better
taste
this
is
truly
a
favorite
not
as
sweet
as
original
this
is
the
only
beer
ive
given
straight
5s
for
every
category
so
i
want
to
back
it
up
with
a
review
the
first
time
i
had
tried
this
i
was
completely
blown
away
the
appearance
is
a
great
dark
amber
with
about
an
inch
of
tan
foamy
head
very
inviting
to
say
the
least
this
beer
has
the
aroma
of
caramelvanilla
malt
some
citrus
overtones
and
a
hint
of
oak
at
the
first
sip
the
taste
starts
with
a
nice
balance
of
sweet
caramel
malt
with
piney
bitterness
with
a
big
oak
finish
that
adds
a
certain
sweetness
the
oak
taste
is
the
best
part
in
my
opinion
the
feel
is
smooth
and
not
aggressive
for
the
abv
with
lower
to
moderate
carbonation
making
this
an
easy
drinker
overall
probably
my
favorite
beer
out
there
darker
brown
body
oaked
malty
aroma
very
malty
flavors
good
amount
of
woodyness
also
comes
through
has
a
bitter
finish
but
a
great
tasting
ale
its
nice
that
the
oak
chips
enhance
the
hops
ergo
the
bitterness
a
very
rough
beer
that
many
people
are
probably
not
ready
for
before
being
worthy
aggressive
but
rewarding
nose
is
extreme
malt
almost
as
much
bitter
color
looks
like
diarrhea
no
bull
shitno
pun
nice
aggressive
kick
of
dry
hops
at
the
end
much
rather
drink
the
regular
bomber
bastard
save
your
money
and
stick
with
the
original
one
of
the
very
few
beers
i
give
a
5
rating
will
drink
this
anytime
anyplace
on
a
daily
basis
just
barely
better
than
the
nonoaked
version
overall
i
hate
to
say
this
but
this
ale
is
aggressive
this
is
not
for
everyone
like
the
brewer
said
both
hops
and
malts
come
full
force
and
with
the
aggressive
bitterness
and
also
detectable
alcohol
bite
this
beer
will
take
your
palate
to
a
bar
so
it
can
purposely
beat
it
with
a
stool
i
dont
have
a
problem
slapping
two
bottles
of
this
at
anytime
but
after
two
it
might
get
a
bit
tiresome
it
is
a
liquid
journey
just
not
down
the
alley
i
would
prefer
this
brew
is
worthy
i
enjoy
almost
all
of
stones
beers
and
this
is
right
at
the
top
o
a
typical
brew
from
stone
very
hop
forward
and
bitter
exactly
what
i
was
hoping
for
the
oak
barreling
mellows
out
the
malt
flavor
aftertaste
yet
leaves
a
slight
hoppy
flavor
has
a
reddish
caramel
color
and
lovely
smell
not
too
hoppy
and
not
too
malty
but
will
shock
the
uninitiated
to
strong
ales
from
stone
arrogancy
at
its
best
o
ok
i
just
read
my
review
of
the
nonoaked
version
i
wrote
well
made
beer
just
dont
like
the
dry
treacle
taste
ditto
the
oak
does
not
add
enough
to
this
palate
ah
well
proves
you
need
to
read
your
own
reviews
not
go
by
scores
o
awesome
beer
really
fantastic
aroma
of
hops
oak
and
wood
which
follows
all
the
way
through
to
the
taste
overall
the
oak
barrels
did
wonders
for
this
brew
i
would
definitely
reach
for
this
version
over
the
standard
version
o
highly
recommended
if
you
do
not
like
the
original
arrogant
bastard
due
to
the
lingering
bitterness
then
try
this
one
no
lingering
bitterness
with
full
flavor
and
hints
of
bourbon
and
vanilla
a
beatiful
beer
with
an
abv
of
7
2
that
is
very
well
hidden
great
taste
and
mothfeel
i
recommend
it
straight
from
the
stone
brewery
into
a
growler
poured
into
a
mug
lacing
for
days
with
a
nice
creamy
head
the
oaky
nose
remains
the
center
stage
with
the
scent
from
the
hops
shining
through
exceptionally
smooth
while
still
remaining
a
flavorful
ale
in
a
way
that
only
stone
could
do
the
hops
in
the
finish
keeps
the
bastard
ale
arrogant
for
a
good
reason
2012
on
tap
this
is
one
high
hop
brew
that
i
can
take
it
has
so
many
things
going
on
that
one
never
knows
theyre
being
assaulted
by
all
that
bitterness
well
crafted
worth
tracking
down
o
highly
recommended
a
nice
sweet
strong
ale
that
imparts
a
fine
bourbon
taste
cheers
all
the
aroma
hangs
back
even
as
it
warms
i
get
a
light
woody
oak
with
a
hint
of
caramel
malt
the
flavor
has
an
apparent
bitterness
with
a
drying
finish
theres
a
bit
of
caramel
and
some
toffee
its
maltier
than
i
expected
with
some
oaky
tannins
a
caramel
malt
flavor
and
a
long
finish
m
probably
the
best
thing
about
this
beer
dont
know
what
its
like
out
of
the
bottle
but
on
tap
i
have
never
experienced
a
hoppy
beer
like
this
to
be
so
rich
and
full
in
its
mouthfeel
quite
an
achievement
the
best
mouthfeel
i
have
experienced
overall
i
think
i
prefer
this
one
to
the
original
ab
the
oak
adds
a
depth
that
makes
it
a
really
unique
tasting
beer
and
the
fact
that
its
unused
wood
instead
of
something
like
bourbon
barrels
makes
it
cleaner
and
less
hot
will
definitely
have
to
get
some
more
of
this
excellent
brew
as
a
fan
of
arrogant
bastard
i
couldnt
wait
to
try
its
oak
aged
uncle
it
definitely
did
not
dissappoint
this
ale
pours
one
of
the
sexiest
deep
rich
mahogany
colors
that
i
have
ever
seen
in
a
beer
there
is
a
very
slight
off
white
head
that
gives
way
to
a
substantial
film
and
a
lot
of
thick
cream
lacing
the
aroma
is
rich
and
buttery
with
lots
of
malty
sweet
notes
reminiscent
of
caramel
toffee
and
vanilla
in
addition
there
is
the
wonderful
aroma
of
smoky
oak
and
a
little
piney
hops
this
ale
sips
quite
thick
and
syrupy
definitely
on
the
high
end
of
the
medium
bodied
beers
it
is
not
an
ale
meant
to
just
slug
back
for
only
a
7
2
abver
it
seems
quite
thick
and
full
bodied
the
flavor
surpasses
the
nose
in
its
rich
deliciousness
it
is
sweet
and
malty
and
smoky
and
at
the
same
time
slightly
bitter
and
surprisingly
fresh
tastingat
least
for
an
aged
ale
there
are
plenty
of
caramel
and
vanilla
notes
highlighted
by
the
deep
richness
of
the
oak
and
the
slighly
bitter
notes
of
piney
hops
it
is
sweet
but
not
cloying
and
simultaneously
bitter
but
not
tongue
numbing
like
many
stone
offerings
this
is
truly
a
great
beer
i
dont
know
how
stone
does
it
but
they
continue
to
impress
me
time
and
time
again
maybe
time
to
make
a
pilgrimage
to
visit
them
and
really
take
all
that
they
have
to
offer
in
this
is
a
much
more
calm
version
of
arrogant
bastard
a
nice
take
but
i
wish
the
hops
were
more
present
o
the
shining
star
of
the
ab
series
more
please
this
was
the
first
oaked
beer
i
have
ever
had
and
aging
it
in
oak
really
adds
a
lot
to
this
beer
basically
stone
brewing
co
took
what
is
already
a
favorite
beer
of
many
and
found
a
way
to
make
it
better
the
verdict
its
good
very
tasty
but
too
bitter
for
my
palate
like
most
stone
offerings
as
with
most
quality
oaked
brews
it
improves
as
it
warms
o
this
is
huge
and
deserves
a
bit
of
time
to
enjoy
as
it
changes
as
it
warms
amber
color
and
abundant
bubbles
make
it
look
appealing
and
the
foamy
nature
of
the
thin
head
is
nice
scents
of
brown
sugar
molasses
and
maple
up
front
this
mingles
later
with
vanilla
oak
and
spicy
piney
and
cedarlike
hop
aromas
in
the
background
is
some
faint
citrus
and
overripe
fruit
a
nice
complex
aroma
highlighting
the
malt
hops
and
oak
quite
nicely
taste
begins
with
a
big
hit
of
bitter
hops
simply
bitter
without
much
flavor
this
moves
into
more
bitterness
backed
by
hints
of
caramel
sweetness
a
bit
of
oak
in
the
background
and
bitter
citrus
pith
and
pine
hop
flavors
a
bit
of
fruit
in
the
background
the
finish
is
dry
with
bitter
hop
mostly
pine
but
with
some
citrus
pith
and
a
bit
of
toasted
malt
the
aftertaste
is
bitter
hops
and
toasted
malt
a
big
bold
flavor
not
as
well
balanced
as
the
aroma
quite
bitter
but
not
bad
the
slight
sweetness
works
with
the
bitter
hops
to
make
it
quite
drinkable
and
the
oak
gives
it
some
nice
woodiness
very
good
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
low
carbonation
and
a
resinous
feel
this
makes
it
quite
easy
to
drink
as
it
goes
down
smooth
overall
this
is
a
good
strong
ale
a
nice
balanced
and
complex
aroma
bold
flavor
and
smooth
mouthfeel
combine
to
make
a
very
nice
drinking
experience
good
job
making
a
good
beer
better
stone
overall
i
need
to
try
this
fresh
as
i
know
this
isnt
what
this
brew
is
supposed
to
be
3
29
for
a
single
of
this
and
it
should
have
been
discounted
we
always
say
that
stone
does
best
with
their
special
brews
but
i
am
starting
to
appreciate
their
everyday
beers
as
well
the
oak
adds
a
wonderful
complexity
to
the
arrogant
bastard
base
a
great
beer
that
is
very
much
like
an
american
barleywine
but
very
well
made
unlike
some
other
attempts
update
had
it
on
tap
and
it
was
even
better
very
smooth
with
nice
vanilla
and
oak
notes
to
complement
the
earthy
hops
malt
profile
was
far
less
dominant
very
bitter
brew
and
very
good
o
ill
post
another
note
with
a
bottle
still
in
the
freshness
date
as
is
this
is
a
very
tasty
beer
though
in
my
opinion
not
quite
to
the
level
of
its
official
ba
100
rating
the
taste
is
quite
hoppy
if
this
is
your
thing
then
you
will
love
this
beer
unfortunately
i
am
not
fan
of
hoppy
beers
this
one
reminds
me
more
of
an
ipa
amber
slightly
dull
with
a
quickly
dissipating
head
nose
of
sugary
marzipan
dark
fruits
like
figs
cranberries
and
cherries
not
picking
up
any
grain
or
hop
scents
just
a
sweet
dark
fruitiness
taste
of
sweet
boozy
fruits
immediately
cut
by
acrid
bitterness
a
resiny
pithy
bitter
that
keeps
the
sweet
cooked
sugars
from
being
overpowering
finishing
on
an
earthy
woody
note
that
rounds
the
sharp
edges
full
mouthfeel
with
enough
carbonation
to
keep
it
from
feeling
heavy
an
improvement
on
the
already
fantastic
original
recipe
o
nicely
done
i
love
this
beer
and
the
variations
of
it
the
only
one
i
dont
seem
to
like
is
the
pepper
variations
but
stone
is
spot
on
with
this
brew
who
says
you
cant
teach
an
old
dog
new
tricks
o
very
good
beer
i
like
it
better
than
the
normal
arrogant
bastard
offering
theres
a
lot
to
like
here
the
oak
aging
does
a
lot
of
good
in
this
one
the
oak
gives
it
a
great
vanilla
note
that
carries
throughout
the
beer
you
also
get
the
strong
citrus
notes
in
here
thats
the
counter
part
to
the
sweetness
one
of
the
better
stone
beers
available
o
a
great
brew
to
really
get
everything
you
can
out
of
an
american
strong
ale
like
others
i
would
be
interested
in
trying
one
right
off
the
line
fresh
instead
of
being
an
arrogant
bastard
with
oak
added
this
guy
really
transformed
into
a
mellow
but
still
very
strong
beer
will
be
buying
again
overall
an
absolutely
excellent
tweak
to
an
already
excellent
beer
when
im
in
the
mood
for
arrogant
bastard
ill
definitely
be
going
oaked
from
now
on
the
mellowed
down
character
with
depth
of
flavors
makes
this
even
better
o
awesome
beer
that
is
different
in
todays
domination
of
ipas
i
think
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
to
drink
in
the
winter
pours
a
deep
amber
color
into
a
tulip
glass
the
one
finger
head
shrinks
pretty
quickly
leaving
some
nice
lacing
and
sparse
islands
of
foam
it
sure
looks
good
in
the
glass
though
the
smell
is
all
hops
and
oak
piney
with
some
citrus
undertones
the
oak
is
there
stronger
than
most
other
oaked
beers
that
ive
had
tastes
like
an
imperial
ipa
strong
upfront
hops
that
resound
with
resiny
pines
and
sour
citrus
not
unlike
most
other
stone
products
that
ive
tried
the
oak
is
very
pronounced
almost
fighting
with
the
hops
for
dominance
the
first
couple
sips
are
almost
unsettling
and
im
not
really
sold
on
this
one
as
i
finish
i
have
grown
more
acclimated
to
the
flavors
but
a
little
underwhelmed
carbonation
is
light
and
the
finish
seems
pretty
dry
overall
i
dont
think
ill
revisit
this
one
for
a
while
which
is
a
shame
as
i
was
looking
forward
to
giving
it
a
try
o
solid
beer
easy
to
drink
lots
of
flavors
to
pick
up
on
but
fairly
balanced
o
im
really
surprised
at
this
one
drinks
and
tastes
like
an
ipa
completely
lacks
the
complexity
of
the
regular
bastard
and
the
oak
aging
is
lost
on
me
still
a
good
beer
but
ill
take
other
things
for
the
money
well
after
being
harassed
by
my
buddies
about
why
i
havent
drank
this
beer
i
decided
to
give
a
try
although
i
bought
the
oaked
aba
it
pours
out
in
a
nice
dark
brown
reddish
color
i
think
the
smell
is
a
lot
stronger
than
the
actual
taste
once
i
smelled
it
with
that
dark
smoky
smell
i
figured
it
would
be
a
little
hard
to
drink
since
smell
is
half
the
taste
i
have
to
admit
i
enjoyed
it
i
will
be
having
this
beer
again
soon
overall
another
complex
and
flavorful
brew
from
the
folks
at
stone
o
good
beer
with
a
lot
going
on
a
nice
sipper
for
a
cold
evening
this
is
another
great
beer
in
the
bastard
family
from
stone
a
deep
amber
color
is
just
tempting
immediately
you
can
pick
up
on
the
oaken
notes
in
the
smell
and
taste
immediately
low
carbonation
the
oak
notes
are
very
much
imparted
in
the
taste
a
good
hop
character
still
shines
through
as
well
a
must
try
to
have
at
least
tasted
i
prefer
the
arrogant
or
double
bastard
over
the
oaked
although
the
oaken
bastard
is
very
good
poured
on
tap
into
a
pint
glass
pours
slightly
cloudy
red
with
little
head
smells
of
floral
and
cirtis
notes
with
a
nice
deep
fruity
bouquet
tastes
of
berries
overwhelmingly
with
slight
citrus
but
still
has
some
lingering
bite
beer
is
medium
bodied
nicely
carbonated
good
bite
overall
a
superb
beer
i
am
not
worthy
this
is
another
solid
from
stone
bold
complex
and
well
balanced
nevertheless
i
still
preferred
the
original
version
notes
i
drank
this
two
days
after
purchasing
but
noticed
im
drinking
after
the
best
by
date
so
id
love
to
try
a
fresher
one
to
see
if
it
is
any
better
o
this
is
one
fantastic
beer
the
oak
does
wonders
for
the
flavor
and
the
huge
sweetness
of
the
brown
sugar
and
molasses
are
slightly
balanced
by
the
bitter
hops
its
surprisingly
easy
drinking
despite
7
2
abv
and
thick
sticky
body
o
i
dont
remember
this
being
so
sweet
when
i
first
had
it
very
drinkable
and
pleasing
adark
amber
color
body
o
not
all
that
different
from
the
original
arrogant
bastard
ale
but
still
a
welcome
development
with
something
to
offer
d
this
is
a
very
nice
complement
to
the
base
beer
i
dont
think
it
elevates
the
overall
score
but
the
oak
is
definitely
a
nice
added
nuance
that
works
well
overall
this
is
a
beer
i
like
quite
a
bit
finally
got
around
to
reviewing
it
the
fact
that
its
best
by
date
is
up
in
a
week
makes
me
wonder
what
one
fresh
off
the
line
would
taste
like
ive
had
it
before
but
didnt
pay
that
much
attention
to
the
dates
all
were
excellent
love
that
oak
flavor
thanks
stone
o
took
me
a
while
to
get
this
one
but
i
am
happy
i
did
the
oak
on
the
taste
and
smell
are
done
so
very
well
it
sets
the
bar
for
others
to
follow
a
great
beer
with
good
balance
of
all
elements
o
a
very
good
quality
beer
nice
beer
to
sip
and
enjoy
on
a
rainy
evening
cheers
overall
good
stuff
a
stalwart
ale
o
as
you
are
finishing
the
beer
you
the
taste
of
the
hops
fades
with
the
roast
tatse
taking
over
love
it
o
a
tasty
treat
though
not
as
sippably
so
as
i
would
prefer
love
the
text
on
the
bottle
posturing
arrogance
to
the
drinker
and
waxing
philosophical
about
life
and
success
funny
beer
poured
into
a
pint
had
a
nice
mahogany
brown
color
the
head
is
a
light
creamy
brown
dies
rapidly
to
a
slight
foamy
head
easy
to
drink
under
the
first
taste
had
a
citrusy
bite
but
the
back
taste
was
hops
not
as
smooth
as
many
beers
but
you
dont
want
this
one
to
be
smooth
you
want
some
taste
and
this
has
it
a
very
good
beer
serving
type
bottle
overall
good
beer
not
for
everyone
though
strong
burnt
bitterness
tastewise
theres
dry
oakyness
at
the
front
with
slight
cherries
and
baked
apple
it
finishes
bitter
with
even
more
oak
the
oak
works
nicely
to
subdue
the
malt
and
booze
a
bit
of
piny
and
floral
hops
are
noticable
as
well
it
has
a
very
creamy
mouthfeel
that
tempers
the
boldness
of
the
flavors
i
really
love
what
the
oak
does
to
arrogant
bastard
great
beer
o
this
is
probably
the
highest
ill
ever
rate
a
nonipa
but
this
beer
from
stone
is
very
ipalike
as
they
are
obviously
using
a
lot
of
great
hops
and
you
can
really
taste
them
through
the
heavy
malt
and
oak
overall
its
a
beer
that
could
be
enjoyed
by
guys
who
like
lagers
and
even
hopheads
the
beer
is
superior
as
it
warms
compared
to
right
after
you
pop
the
top
it
goes
down
like
an
ipa
you
get
used
to
it
after
the
first
couple
sips
then
its
really
smooth
another
good
offering
from
stone
overall
arrogant
bastard
got
me
into
craft
beer
and
this
oaked
version
is
even
better
i
love
this
beer
and
always
will
o
insanely
complex
and
a
one
of
a
kind
i
do
however
prefer
the
regular
arrogant
bastard
overall
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
this
is
a
good
beer
for
people
that
like
a
bit
of
dark
a
bit
of
hops
and
a
bit
of
oak
all
rolled
into
one
beer
i
personally
like
all
of
the
above
so
this
is
a
treat
every
time
cheers
o
better
than
the
original
its
a
great
american
strong
ale
i
like
the
fact
that
it
has
characteristics
of
different
kinds
of
beers
ipa
red
ale
barleywine
at
different
points
throughout
drinking
it
what
an
interesting
flavorful
journey
its
an
ipa
a
red
ale
and
a
barleywine
at
different
points
throught
consumption
not
sure
why
its
taken
me
this
long
to
try
it
but
i
suspect
ill
enjoy
it
again
in
the
future
its
almost
like
a
toneddown
barley
wine
in
some
ways
it
kind
of
makes
me
think
of
arctic
devil
but
with
hoppy
bitterness
epmphasized
more
than
sweetness
however
the
truth
is
that
this
oaked
version
of
arrogant
bastard
is
unlike
anything
else
ive
ever
tasted
and
the
standard
cersion
was
already
incredibly
unique
and
awesome
a
terrific
twist
which
has
created
a
beer
that
bends
the
dimensions
to
its
will
with
its
unreal
complexities
wow
a
tsunami
of
flavour
washes
over
your
tastebuds
worthy
of
its
name
it
looks
good
while
the
aroma
and
flavour
are
stunning
tons
of
pineladen
hops
and
sweet
malt
with
the
booze
very
well
hidden
the
hop
character
lacks
depth
but
who
cares
when
its
this
good
the
oak
chips
are
quite
subtle
but
lend
a
woody
dimension
with
a
whiff
of
vanilla
body
is
silky

a
topnotch
effort
once
again
stone
school
other
brewers
in
how
to
go
nuts
with
hops
well
worth
sampling
if
you
have
the
chance
to
try
it
better
than
regular
arrogant
bastard
and
maybe
better
than
double
bastard
o
stone
is
a
peak
beer
experience
arrogant
bastard
is
the
one
to
take
if
you
get
banished
to
the
moon
similar
too
its
brother
the
arrogant
bastard
the
oak
aged
version
is
very
good
adding
a
bit
of
a
twist
to
our
already
hoprific
friend
the
smell
is
great
the
taste
is
better
respectable
abv
and
as
always
a
very
cool
bottle
if
you
like

give
this

very
nice

and
quite
smooth
to
sip
on
even
with
the
huge
bitterness
a
very
enjoyable
offering
o
aba
is
a
work
of
art
and
this
is
just
another
piece
in
that
gallery
of
fine
bastard
ales
my
wife
says
im
an
arrogant
bastard
and
maybe
thats
why
i
like
these
so
much
though
i
think
its
more
to
its
in
your
face
flavor
that
does
that
one
things
for
sure
i
cant
get
enough
liquid
arrogance
and
oaked
bastard
instantly
became
an
all
time
favorite
for
me
whether
its
beside
the
camp
fire
in
mid
summer
or
the
fire
place
on
a
cold
winter
night
oaked
bastard
seems
to
find
my
glass
at
some
point
if
you
like
ab
then
this
is
a
no
brainer
if
you
dont
well
like
the
bottle
says
its
probably
not
for
you
anyway
well
this
is
very
good
i
recommend
giving
this
a
try
it
didnt
to
me
stand
out
as
something
id
go
very
far
out
of
my
way
to
seek
out
it
is
good
though
and
if
it
is
looking
at
you
and
there
are
no
other
good
choices
at
the
time
this
will
definitely
come
through
as
a
worthwhile
drink
o
not
an
amazing
beer
but
not
horrible
if
you
dont
like
arrogant
bastard
ale
or
stone
brewings
overall
style
you
wont
like
this
if
you
do
its
worth
a
tryi
think
it
is
pretty
good
i
might
finish
this
bottle
i
might
not
but
i
will
definitely
not
be
drinking
another
one
whatever
hops
they
put
in
this
beer
however
they
add
them
it
doesnt
agree
with
me
turns
out
an
oaky
version
of
a
beer
i
dont
like
is
still
a
beer
i
dont
like
i
like
ab
not
too
too
much
though
oaked
is
another
step
up
destinctive
special
b
flavor
that
stone
throws
in
all
their
brews
seamingly
strong
flavor
not
for
the
faint
hearted
pretty
dark
reddish
brown
oak
finish
for
obvious
reason
get
plowed
drink
local
beers
sd
stone
you
guys
knocked
it
outta
the
park
on
this
one
everything
we
love
about
arrogant
bastardthe
aggressiveness
the
sweetness
the
gnarled
head
of
foam
and
the
global
reputation
were
all
upheld
all
they
did
was
add
a
fantastic
woodsy
quality
and
then
tied
all
the
flavors
together
with
rebar
and
forcefields
great
complex
beer
a
little
too
resiny
bitter
for
my
liking
but
still
very
good
in
all
other
respects
easily
drinkable
for
a
big
flavorful
beer
gotta
say
i
like
this
better
than
i
remember
having
tried
it
years
ago
o
not
my
typical
style
or
preference
but
it
was
a
refreshing
change
in
pace
solid
offering
by
a
solid
brewery
overall
4
50
excellent
brew
the
addition
of
the
oak
has
transformed
an
already
wonderful
brew
into
something
on
another
level
i
know
my
score
does
not
reflect
a
true
average
of
the
different
component
scores
but
the
taste
of
this
beer
has
to
be
experienced
in
order
to
be
fully
appreciated
recommended
pick
a
four
pack
up
if
you
find
it
overall
not
having
tried
the
non
oaked
version
i
found
this
quite
a
nice
ale
easy
drinking
but
pretty
decent
full
flavoured
and
with
a
little
added
complexity
and
bite
to
it
from
the
oaking
oa
nice
beer
the
oak
imparts
nice
flavors
if
the
balance
was
a
tad
better
the
beer
would
be
phenomenal
overall
very
complex
and
delicious
and
a
heavy
hitter
on
the
abv
overall
a
fantastically
enjoyable
strong
ale
overall
a
really
nice
interesting
complex
beer
pours
a
cloudy
orangered
with
a
thin
off
white
head
that
fades
into
a
thin
lacing
after
a
while
in
the
glass
the
chill
haze
subsides
and
the
beer
clears
up
the
aroma
is
pretty
muted
the
hops
may
have
faded
at
this
point
its
malty
with
notes
of
caramel
and
some
woodyvanilla
hints
the
taste
is
not
as
assertive
as
regular
ab
im
wondering
if
the
oaking
mellowed
it
out
a
little
bit
or
if
it
was
the
age
of
the
beer
its
a
relatively
chewy
malt
bomb
toffee
bready
caramel
and
oak
are
the
predominate
flavor
profiles
the
body
is
mediumthick
but
not
syrupy
there
is
a
slight
tannin
finish
to
the
beer
presumably
from
the
oaking
i
like
this
beer
but
im
not
a
fan
of
the
tannins
although
i
cant
complain
since
the
4pack
was
only
5
overall
while
i
did
not
like
this
beer
to
the
extent
i
like
the
standard
arrogant
bastard
it
is
still
an
excellent
beer
no
doubt
i
would
highly
recommend
it
although
i
would
also
recommend
you
drink
the
original
first
for
a
control
group
comparison
purposes
great
beer
o
very
good
beer
the
vanilla
in
the
beer
shines
through
thanks
to
the
oak
aging
its
pretty
darn
delicious
i
may
revisit
this
beer
if
im
in
the
mood
for
a
smooth
well
balanced
woody
beer
poured
into
snifter
deep
gorgeous
ruby
red
with
a
full
white
head
that
leaves
lots
of
lacing
smells
hoppy
like
an
ipa
but
with
a
thicker
malt
presence
taste
is
similar
to
the
smell
hops
up
front
solid
malts
through
but
a
sweet
woody
oak
finish
that
sneaks
in
at
the
last
second
mouthfeel
is
pretty
full
but
smooth
delicious
overall
i
do
like
the
oak
treatment
the
they
added
to
arrogant
bastard
it
adds
a
layer
of
complexity
to
an
already
very
solid
beer
the
only
downside
is
the
added
expense
a
solid
treat
now
and
then
o
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
beer
i
like
the
original
but
the
oak
added
to
it
more
than
i
thought
it
would
still
a
good
hop
hit
and
aggressive
but
adds
an
interesting
element
to
a
great
beer
quite
nice
a
touch
more
oak
filled
and
spicy
than
i
would
have
like
but
the
beer
did
not
suffer
for
this
the
beer
was
very
smooth
and
highly
drinkable
despite
the
relatively
high
abv
and
the
strong
taste
there
was
a
good
malt
taste
to
the
beer
that
complimented
the
initial
early
hop
one
beautifully
and
went
down
a
treat
a
strong
but
very
enjoyable
beer
overall
a
hugely
complex
beer
the
oak
chips
really
take
this
beer
to
a
whole
new
level
and
add
a
lot
of
nice
flavors
i
could
probably
only
drink
one
of
these
in
a
sitting
but
its
good
nonetheless
o
a
very
big
and
bold
beer
tastes
very
different
and
unique
in
a
good
way
i
have
never
had
anything
like
that
before
my
friend
couldnt
stand
it
because
he
said
it
was
like
drinking
a
tree
while
he
was
right
its
not
necessarily
a
bad
thing
overall
a
very
pleasant
experience
if
you
get
the
chance
to
try
this
dont
pass
it
up
very
good
strong
ale
better
than
double
bastard
in
my
opinion
easy
toslug
sip
and
enjoy
o
a
nice
adaptation
on
arrogant
bastard
oak
mixes
well
with
hops
very
drinkable
probably
the
best
bastard
due
to
the
increased
restraint
that
the
oakaging
brings
o
arrogant
bastard
is
huge
the
oak
version
is
even
bigger
o
nice
beer
and
better
than
i
remember
smoother
than
regular
ab
and
has
nice
sweetness
to
it
o
this
is
a
nice
beer
though
one
has
to
really
enjoy
ipatype
hoppiness
and
bitterness
to
like
it
the
oak
adds
some
complexity
to
the
taste
i
have
not
tried
the
nonoaked
version
of
this
beer
so
i
dont
know
how
they
compare
but
this
one
is
pretty
good
this
is
an
aggressive
ale
but
you
most
certainly
will
like
it
pours
that
signature
bastard
darkish
red
color
with
a
1
5
finger
bonewhite
head
head
is
extremely
smooth
with
great
lacing
the
smell
is
very
similar
to
that
of
the
standard
bastard
but
with
just
a
hint
of
the
oak
chips
at
the
very
end
the
taste
is
actually
quite
different
from
the
standard
aba
this
time
sweetness
biterness
and
oakiness
dominate
with
just
a
bit
of
pine
at
the
end
the
mouth
is
also
quite
similar
to
the
original
bastard
smooth
yet
leaves
the
biterness
lingering
overall
im
won
over
honestly
id
probably
buy
this
over
the
original
any
day
but
unfortunately
its
not
as
common
good
thing
im
from
san
diego
well
i
dont
care
for
the
taste
but
it
has
some
things
going
for
it
the
appearance
and
mouthfeel
do
win
it
some
points
unfortunately
these
pale
in
comparison
to
the
taste
for
me
i
enjoy
barrel
aged
beers
so
im
a
bit
surprised
at
this
one
im
guessing
this
is
a
polarizing
brew
still
though
worth
trying
once
10
99
for
a
4
pk
a
great
beer
and
too
easy
to
drink
overall
i
finished
it
thats
about
it
nonoaked
version
is
slightly
better
o
meh
not
my
preferred
style
but
not
as
bad
as
some
of
the
recent
offerings
ive
had
from
stone
maybe
im
just
not
in
the
right
mood
to
enjoy
it
to
the
extent
it
seems
most
people
have
overallcomments
wow
one
of
the
better
beers
that
ive
ever
had
super
complex
in
every
aspect
with
a
great
nose
and
a
flavor
profile
that
takes
the
drinker
on
an
adventure
the
oak
was
awesome
o
one
of
the
standouts
of
the
stone
brew
line
the
oak
presence
adds
a
layer
to
the
already
strong
and
well
balanced
brew
that
features
big
and
sweet
malt
along
with
refreshing
and
crisp
hops
pours
dark
red
with
nice
head
aroma
of
pine
hops
and
faint
oak
definite
malt
presence
flavor
has
a
nice
oak
up
front
and
strong
toffee
malt
hops
give
it
a
crisp
finish
the
dry
sharp
oak
seems
to
wash
out
some
of
the
nice
regular
arrogant
bastard
malt
sweetness
that
balanced
this
beer
not
bad
but
need
to
be
in
the
mood
for
some
oakiness
for
sure
a
bit
like
chewing
on
a
piece
of
wood
o
good
beer
that
is
very
much
like
the
original
ab
a
small
difference
in
the
nose
and
a
mellowing
of
the
bitterness
in
the
taste
to
make
up
for
the
less
bitterness
there
is
a
good
oaky
flavor
that
adds
to
the
complexity
of
the
beer
overall
very
enjoyable
mellow
beer
my
only
gripe
would
be
that
the
flavor
profile
could
have
used
a
little
more
sweetness
to
counter
act
the
oaky
and
earthy
notes
onice
to
review
a
true
classic
and
one
of
the
beers
that
got
me
into
beer
nearly
a
decade
ago
it
is
a
close
call
between
this
bastard
and
the
standard
nonoaked
version
both
are
great
beers
but
i
think
the
oak
imparts
some
additional
character
that
pushes
this
version
over
the
top
in
all
enjoyable
oa
solid
strong
ale
with
a
nice
oak
presence
a
nice
complement
to
the
regular
version
o
loved
it
will
have
again
a
little
bit
strong
alcohol
wise
so
keep
that
in
mind
while
sessioning
overall
pleasing
aromas
and
a
very
wellbalanced
beer
a
little
thinner
than
i
imagined
but
other
than
that
it
is
highquality
overall
a
nice
offering
by
stone
for
some
reason
this
hop
bomb
is
a
bit
much
i
love
this
beer
i
am
going
to
try
and
find
a
clone
recipe
and
see
how
close
i
can
get
but
until
then
i
will
be
keeping
a
4
pack
in
the
fridge
in
short
intervals
pours
a
rich
mahogany
with
a
finger
and
a
half
of
head
mild
carbonation
good
retention
and
lacing
so
far
so
good
aroma
of
hops
some
citrus
oak
with
some
sweet
caramel
malts
making
a
rigid
backbone
taste
follows
the
nose
well
strong
up
front
hops
with
a
tinge
of
citrus
smokey
oak
caramel
some
toffee
with
sweet
malts
bringing
them
all
together
mouth
is
pretty
good
as
well
strong
bitterness
thick
full
body
with
a
sticky
resin
and
dry
finish
very
easy
to
drink
overall
a
good
idea
that
turned
out
to
be
a
great
one
i
prefer
this
over
the
regular
bastard
any
day
overall
a
wonderfully
accessible
albeit
entrylevel
woodaffected
beer
there
are
of
course
many
with
a
more
genuine
wood
contribution
but
in
terms
of
a
widely
accessible
high
quality
brew
ill
have
another
arrogant
bastard
ale
hails
from
a
category
that
im
not
um
skilled
in
certainly
not
an
expert
i
do
not
prefer
brown
or
belgian
ales
so
i
was
actually
surprised
to
find
this
complex
a
flavor
profile
from
a
category
named
american
strong
ale
generally
i
do
not
like
the
schmaltzy
aftertaste
of
standard
ales
english
belgian
and
brown
preferring
instead
those
of
the
highly
hopped
ipa
category
this
beer
has
harnessed
my
curiosity
to
explore
the
ale
experiments
a
bit
more
very
nice
beer
copper
tone
with
a
limited
head
but
a
strident
aftertaste
of
hop
i
wouldnt
refuse
this
beer
even
at
an
ipa
beer
bust
o
very
enjoybable
the
oak
aging
really
enhanced
the
character
of
this
brew
and
raisted
the
rating
quite
a
bit
for
me
good
stuff
poured
into
duval
tulipreally
suprised
at
how
much
the
mouthfeel
has
softened
on
this
one
not
much
of
a
fan
of
the
stone
palate
wrecker
hop
blast
style
although
i
can
recognize
it
as
good
beer
this
is
really
nice
2008
bottle
thats
been
chillin
in
my
cellar
makes
me
wish
id
saved
a
couple
more
deep
amber
great
head
after
4
years
in
the
bottle
piney
citrus
hops
are
still
readily
apparent
on
the
nose
but
the
flavor
really
shines
a
smooth
operator
flavor
quick
piney
blast
smooth
creamy
bitterness
and
soft
tea
with
an
oak
finish
and
smooth
smooth
hoperator
finish
i
could
drink
this
all
night
o
having
been
an
arrogant
bastard
fan
from
day
1
i
recall
being
very
excited
when
this
oaked
version
hit
store
shelves
i
also
remember
being
shocked
by
the
186pk
price
but
buying
it
anyway
sadly
i
recall
not
being
at
all
impressed
by
this
beer
fresh
finding
it
quite
harsh
and
not
very
enjoyable
hence
a
primary
reason
this
has
been
sitting
quietly
in
my
cellar
for
8
years
so
when
i
stumbled
upon
this
bottle
i
figured
it
was
as
good
a
time
as
any
to
give
it
another
try
what
i
find
now
is
a
truly
excellent
beer
that
has
held
up
very
well
and
improved
greatly
with
age
the
balance
here
is
just
about
perfect
and
the
flavors
have
mellowed
a
bit
and
blended
together
to
create
a
beer
that
truly
surprised
me
not
sure
i
have
the
patience
anymore
to
lay
a
beer
down
for
8
years
at
least
intentionally
but
i
am
really
hoping
that
i
have
another
of
these
vintage
bottles
hiding
in
a
dark
corner
of
my
cellar
collection
o
meh
its
good
but
definitely
nothing
i
would
seek
out
again
i
guess
i
was
expecting
something
bigger

all

i

nonetheless
a
very

edition
of
an
already
great
strong

i
highly
recommend
giving
this
a
shot
this
is
truly
one
of
the
best
strong
ales
beautiful
dark

just
a
great

all
around
just
need
the
stores
to
stock
it

love

this
is

bitter

very
complex
beer
this
is
stone
at
its
best
ive
had
three
12oz
bottles
and
i
feel
great
this
is
great
beer
overall
a
more
complex
and
smoother
version
of
arrogant
bastard
ale
which
was
amazing
in
its
own
right
this
is
a
must
try
if
youre
a
fan
of
hoppy
strong
ales
a
really
good
beer
but
tastes
like
something
ive
had
before
this
beer
pours
dark
cherry
amber
with
a
creamy
cappuchino
colored
head
that
leaves
a
nice
film
over
the
beer
and
leaves
a
bit
of
lace
the
aroma
smells
of
caramel
toasted
and
honey
malts
along
with
musty
woodiness
and
faint
floral
hops
the
taste
is
up
front
with
the
malt
characteristics
of
caramel
toast
and
honey
but
the
beer
then
gives
way
to
the
oak
characteristics
before
finally
finishing
with
a
piney
hop
characteristic
the
beer
also
displays
a
mediumfull
mouthfeel
with
a
subtle
carbonation
overall
a
very
enjoyable
beer
i
would
like
to
see
a
more
potent
hop
characteristic
like
the
regular
arrogant
bastard
but
the
oaked
version
pleases
nonetheless
this
is
a
really
good
beer
it
is
a
bit
different
from
the
original
but
if
i
wasnt
told
it
was
oak
aged
i
dont
know
if
i
would
be
able
to
tell
that
that
is
what
was
different
its
been
a
long
time
since
ive
had
a
beer
that
was
truly
unique
and
this
one
is
it
pours
nice
and
dark
and
the
oak
on
the
nose
is
absolutely
wonderful
nice
creamy
head
the
first
sip
is
oak
and
hops
fighting
for
control
at
the
same
time
its
so
nicely
balanced
its
a
tie
and
the
hop
finish
is
complete
a
very
heavy
ale
and
i
would
guess
it
would
be
easy
to
bugger
this
combination
up
but
stone
has
out
done
themselves
a
truly
fantastic
ale
in
a
league
of
its
own
the
only
negative
is
this
is
a
one
bottle
at
a
time
kinda
ale
i
cant
see
sitting
around
and
draining
56
of
these
thats
not
much
of
a
negative
but
this
one
is
a
must
try
and
cannot
help
but
love
experience
d
i
would
gladly
make
this
a
session
beer
of
choice
against
most
others
drinkability
lots
and
lots
i
want
more
this
is
good
stuff
lives
up
to
the
hype
i
think
i
liked
this
a
bit
better
than
regular
ab
exceptionally
smooth
with
silky
carbonation
stones
oaked
bastard
is
a
fine
evolution
of
its
regular
bastard
brother
very
drinkable
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
a
great
consistency
slight
carbonation
i
truly
enjoy
this
but
probably
after
a
few
may
be
overwhelmed
by
the
hop
after
taste
overall
a
great
big
arrogant
beast
grapefruit
is
the
major
player
up
front
as
the
oak
and
smoke
covers
the
back
end
fully
and
tastefully
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
carries
the
heavy
flavors
matchlessly
some
sweet
whisky
like
wisps
is
the
back
end
of
the
taste
this
is
exquisite
stuff
not
for
amateurs
absolutely
first
class
i
would
love
to
try
this
on
tap
d
to
be
honest
i
cant
see
myself
drinking
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
single
sitting
its
a
damn
good
beer
but
the
spiciness
of
it
is
a
bit
much
for
me
i
definately
prefer
the
nonoaked
bastard
over
this
one
highly
quaffable
and
decidedly
delicious
i
expected
more
of
a
woody
oakiness
to
be
present
but
sadly
or
perhaps
not
so
sadly
i
dont
really
know
for
sure
the
oak
didnt
show
itself
overtly
still
a
beautiful
ale
and
an
equally
beautiful
drink
i
enjoy
arrogant
bastard
as
is
but
i
think
the
oak
barrels
and
the
aging
makes
for
a
much
more
complex
and
delicious
beer
drinkability
is
good
this
is
a
mildly
subtle
yet
complex
brew
with
a
wonderful
malt
smoothness
and
at
the
same
time
a
solid
hop
bitterness
somewhat
of
a
paradox
in
comparing
opposites
within
the
same
profile
this
brew
walks
that
line
while
remaining
satisfying
and
drinkable
many
others
have
failed
where
this
brew
seeks
its
solace
in
the
nomansland
of
sweet
and
bitter
of
malty
and
hoppy
the
balance
of
an
esb
with
assertive
hop
quality
and
warming
malt
complexity
cheers
pours
a
handsome
mahogany

somewhat
slowly
leaving
a
few
scattered
dots
of
lacing
in
the
glass
rich
malty
aroma
sweetthick
caramel
smell
and
just
a
hint
of
smokiness
some
sweet
citrus
flavors
slight
grapefruit
bitterness
but
definitely
a
maltheavy
brew
robust
and
rich
and
again
just
faint
hints
of
smokewood
mediumbodied
i
think
i
might
like
this
one
just
a
tad
thicker
but
it
still
works
well
also
some
great
lingering
bitterness
on
the
back
and
sides
of
the
tongue
drinkability
really
surprised
me
here
i
want
another
one
now
is
it
really
arrogance
if
it
due
the
respect
my
latest
sampling
from
the
stones
brewing
company
this
beer
is
something
else
the
beer
smells
florally
hops
and
malts
present
taste
is
bittersweet
with
a
good
blend
of
hop
and
malt
and
a
bit
of
taste
of
brown
sugar
it
has
a
fairly
thick
feel
on
the
tongue
full
body
if
it
wernt
such
a
pricey
beer
thered
be
nothing
keeping
this
bastard
on
the
shelves
definitely
one
you
could
do
more
then
one
of
and
its
not
too
high
in
the
alcohol
to
make
it
too
overwhelming
definitely
a
darn
good
beer
d
this
is
great
beer
definitely
one
that
merits
drinking
slowly
and
enjoying
my
first
offering
from
this
brewery
and
i
was
very
pleased
i
would
love
to
try
more
if
only
i
could
get
anything
else
from
this
brewer
either
in
missouri
or
illinois
d
oaked
ab
is
relatively
drinkable
because
its
smooth
complex
and
tasty
im
a
huge
fan
of
this
beer
and
i
look
forward
to
buying
some
more
soon
i
enjoyed
this
beer
but
there
is
something
about
it
that
isnt
quite
there
all
in
all
this
was
a
solid
beer
what
else
should
one
expect
from
stone
d
highly
drinkable
a
must
try
for
all
beer
lovers
d
not
a
terribly
sessionable
brew
but
definitely
a
nice
beer
that
wouldnt
be
a
bad
idea
to
seek
out
if
youve
never
had
it
my
first
stone
has
pleased
me
greatly
and
i
look
forward
to
enjoying
more
of
their
work
theyre
lucky
after
that
shot
at
my
self
esteem
on
the
bottle
drinkability
is
very
good
i
finished
this
beer
much
to
faster
than
i
should
have
at
that
point
in
the
night
but
i
had
a
very
easy
time
doing
it
definitely
give
this
bad
boy
a
shot
drinkability
this
isnt
my
type
of
beer
because
of
the
strong
hops
bitterness
but
i
could
definitely
see
the
quality
of
this
brew
in
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
elements
very
satisfying
its
extreme
without
getting
ridiculous
i
loves
me
some
stone
and
im
so
glad
i
can
now
pick
this
up
whenever
i
want
there
is
a
definate
signature
taste
i
think
it
is
a
very
well
crafted
brew
i
would
recomend
it
it
pours
a
red
amber
color
with
a
nice
big
brown
tinted
head
good
lacing
too
the
nose
is
dark

roasty

slight
sour
oak
the
taste
is
oaky
dark
cherries
roasted
malts
bitter
as
hell
medium
body
low
smoothe

a
very
smoothe
brew
this
brew
makes
me
wanna
eat
oak
aged
babies
excellent
bottle
pours
a
cloudy
reddishbrown
unappealing
not
pretty
to
look
at
ok
ill
say
it
it
is
ugly
smells
of
deep
fruits
and
lots
of
alcohol
the
aroma
is
complex
with
honey
and
pear
battling
a
ton
of
other
notes
all
screaming
to
be
heard
first
sip
is
tangybitter
also
complex
there
is
a
whole
lot
going
on
here
the
oak
really
makes
this
7
2
abv
beer
seem
a
ton
stronger
an
intriguing
complex
ale
that
is
spicy
bitter
and
tangy
you
have
my
attention
every
time
i
have
had
this
beer
its
been
good
but
this
particular
bottle
however
old
it
is
is
a
bit
more
interesting
to
me
since
the
hops
dont
quite
knock
me
over
the
head
as
is
the
case
with
most
hoppy
beers
these
days
d
the
more
i
drink
of
it
the
more
i
want
another
the
taste
grows
on
you
drinkability
very
interesting
and
tasty
and
not
as
arrogant
as
expected
i
havent
had
arrogant
bastard
in
years
but
figured
id
try
this
oaked
version
on
tap
at
monks
kettle
in
case
my
tastes
have
changed
lets
see
nope
still
tastes
like
the
absurdly
overhopped
arrogant
bastard
i
remember
no
balance
at
all
just
pure
hops
maybe
ill
try
it
again
a
few
years
from
now
i
havent
had
the
regular
arrogant
bastard
but
i
am
a
fan
of
the
oaked
version
sampled
from
a
12oz
bottle
id
like
to
experience
it
in
a
bigger
bottle
it
grew
on
me
right
up
to
the
last
sip
and
i
want
more
someday
d
outstanding
overall
but
for
some
reason
i
enjoy
the
bite
of
the
regular
version
of
this
beer
better
but
dont
get
me
wrong
this
one
isnt
bad
either
d
highly
drinkable
this
will
definitely
be
a
stalwart
in
the
fridge
as
i
prefer
six
packs
vs
bombers
the
standard
bastard
is
great
but
this
is
even
better
4
0
d
excellent
beer
i
would
argue
that
aging
it
does
make
it
better
for
most
people
the
biggest
difference
between
a
fresh
one
and
an
almost
year
old
one
is
the
aftertaste
in
the
fresh
oab
the
woody
aftertaste
is
even
stronger
than
the
beer
taste
i
personally
like
that
about
the
beer
but
it
decreses
its
drinkability
the
aged
one
has
a
more
subdued
aftertaste
which
is
more
palatable
for
most
people
arrogant
bastard
itself
is
a
great
beer
oaked
arrogant
bastard
is
that
much
better
topnotch
just
like
the
ordinary
ab
but
probably
not
worth
the
50
premium
price
they
put
on
top
d
this
was
a
very
interesting
beer
i
apprciated
the
oak
flavors
playing
against
the
malt
sweetness
and
the
big
hop
biterness
no
much
to
complain
about
but
i
do
think
this
beer
would
benefit
from
further
aging
im
going
to
need
a
bigger
fridge
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
rust
color
with
brown
tint
to
it
and
a
nice
fluffy
head
that
leaves
nice
thick
lace
on
the
glass
smell
is
a
hoppy
resin
biscuit
and
also
a
bit
of
caramel
in
the
nose
also
nice
notes
of
vanilla
and
wood
taste
is
very
sweet
with
a
nice
sweet
hop
finish
overall
i
cant
detect
much
of
the
oak
in
this
one
but
i
can
detect
the
roasted
malty
character
of
this
brew
overall
this
is
another
awesome
offering
from
stone
i
cant
wait
till
i
can
purchase
this
in
florida
i
am
hearing
very
soon
cant
recommend
this
enough
d
wellcrafted
and
much
preferred
to
the
nonoaked
variety
deceptively
drinkable
considering
the
high
abv
by
my
count
there
should
still
be
four
more
of
these
suckers
at
the
store
and
if
i
have
it
my
way
at
least
one
more
will
be
mine
i
cant
wait
to
have
it
again
great
beer
deep
amber
color
with
a
somewhat
lumpy
inconsistent
head
aromas
of
pine
and
fruit
cocktail
the
taste
is
very
good
toasty
caramel
layered
over
with
pine
fruity
and
oak
notes
creamy
rich
body
a
lot
of
fruitiness
on
the
finish
with
more
woody
notes
coming
through
late
distinctive
without
being
outrageous
recommended
i
dont
know
why
these
guys
of
the
arrogant
line
are
so
arrogant
ive
never
had
a
beer
of
this
line
that
was
anything
better
than
okay
a
drinkable
beer
but
in
low
quantities
not
one
i
would
want
more
then
one
or
two
of
d
for
the
drink
and
the
experience
it
is
very
nice
a
session
beer
it
is
not
i
like
it
and
will
make
it
a
staple
in
my
fridge
if
we
get
this
offering
in
my
area
a
pricey
6pack
when
will
stone
make
an
arrogant
bastard
english
style
mild
ale
huh
i
didnt
realize
english
mild
was
too
americanmassmarket
for
them
or
maybe
their
palette
is
not
sophisticated
enough
crimson
hues
with
a
light
tan
head
would
like
to
see
more
lacing
and
retention
aroma
consists
of
spicy
hops
vanilla
malt
and
oak
the
taste
is
hoppy
to
the
extent
of
being
a
little
too
bitter
for
my
liking
the
aftertaste
is
also
too
acidic
and
is
actually
giving
me
some
wicked
acid
reflux
oak
and
vanilla
can
also
be
found
in
the
flavor
but
are
almost
silenced
by
the
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
the
best
part
of
this
entirely
cocky
beer
characterized
by
a
smooth
creaminess
and
perfect
carbonation
however
i
found
the
bitterness
and
astringency
of
this
one
to
be
a
little
overpowering
thus
limiting
the
drinkability
i
personally
prefer
regular
ab
drinkability
high
the
oak
chips
are
really
noticeable
even
more
so
than
i
thought
and
definitely
adds
a
different
element
to
the
beer
although
ab
itself
is
one
damn
fine
beer
hazy
deep
amber
color
with
a
nice
tan
head
with
lacing
aroma
is
oak
vanilla
fruit
cherries
and
roasted
malt
and
this
part
is
more
enjoyable
than
the
original
i
get
the
wood
chips
right
away
in
the
flavor
with
some
smoky
malts
a
little
sweet
and
tart
with
a
dry
hop
finish
seems
perhaps
a
bit
more
mellow
than
the
original
ab
which
is
probably
the
aging
i
may
prefer
the
standard
ab
which
is
a
little
more
in
your
face
but
they
are
both
excellent
and
very
well
done
a
nice
beer
from
stone
pours
a
deep
amber
orange
color
with
a
big
beige
head
that
remains
for
the
entire
beer
nice
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
wood
tropic
fruits
citris
and
just
a
hint
of
oak
the
flavor
is
very
floral
malty
piney
and
oak
medium
body
average
carbonation
long
dry
woody
finish
the
oak
aging
smoothes
this
monster
out
blends
the
flavors
and
adds
new
ones
awesome
brew
superior
to
the
regular
bastard
which
is
one
of
my
favorites
i
feel
bad
not
giving
this
beer
a
higher
rating
stone
has
consistently
been
one
of
my
favorites
but
i
think
my
tastes
are
leaning
toward
different
styles
now
guess
im
far
far
too
uncultured
to
notice
a
huge
difference
still
a
great
beer
and
an
excellent
birthday
morning
celebratory
drink
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
i
was
disappointed
by
the
lack
of
or
my
perceived
lack
of
oak
taste
and
aroma
drinkability
is
average
but
then
again
i
am
not
a
huge
hop
lover
so
for
those
who
are
or
who
dont
mind
them
it
may
be
higher
recommended
solid
one
finger
sand
colored
head
great
lacing
that
bands
to
my
glass
and
great
retention
too
appealing
color
of
hazy
amber
with
orange
highlights
fantastic
aroma
dominated
by
floral
hops
grapefruit
and
some
malts
underneath
deeply
complex
and
yet
drinkable
malt
flavor
is
forward
then
hop
bitterness
and
finally
an
oak
finish
mediumlight
carbonation
exceptionally
smooth
with
a
great
mouthfeel
top
notch
brew
in
every
way
and
maybe
even
better
than
the
original
it
is
slightly
more
enigmatic
continues
to
develop
as
it
warms
and
a
musttry
for
all
beer
aficionados
whenever
i
find
this
i
will
buy
this
a
very
good
beer
d
yes
please
drinkability
is
quite
low
due
to
the
high
abv
i
would
definitely
search
this
beer
out
again
though
but
its
not
high
up
on
my
list
as
i
wouldnt
be
able
to
drink
anything
else
for
the
night
after
one
of
these
d
alcohol
is
well
hidden
alcohol
is
masked
very
well
and
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
without
flinching
overall
pricey
yet
wellexecuted
idea
by
stone
not
a
daily
drinker
but
a
nice
treat
alas
i
am
still
not
a
fan
of
the
oaked
bastard
on
cask
either
but
for
completely
different
reasons
where
i
found
the
bottled
version
to
be
too
tight
and
overly
strong
with
the
wood
taste
and
feel
i
found
the
cask
to
actually
be
a
nicer
balance
of
wood
to
hops
and
malts
the
head
was
better
and
lasted
quite
a
while
for
a
cask
but
the
biggest
problem
here
is
that
i
think
that
bastard
is
a
a
beer
in
any
form
that
has
to
be
served
cold
many
beers
are
fine
or
even
better
at
room
temperature
but
bastard
is
not
one
of
them
imho
overall
as
i
said
before
the
balance
of
elements
was
better
on
this
one
than
other
bastards
but
that
still
doesnt
mean
that
it
is
well
balanced
across
the
horizon
of
all
ales
pretty
drinkable
for
the
abv
this
made
my
top
10
list
of
beers
a
large
offwhite
head
very
creamy
with
excellent
lacing
the
overall
appearance
is
quite
intimidating
a
murk
dark
brownred
the
aroma
is
great
a
sweet
hoppy
mollasses
with
a
light
doughy
scent
the
palate
on
this
beer
took
me
off
guard
i
was
expecting
a
kick
your
ass
alcohol
taste
but
instead
i
got
a
medium
body
with
very
soft
carbonation
the
flavor
was
very
sweet
and
the
alcoholic
finish
didnt
last
2
days
like
the
ruination
ipa
did
it
has
been
some
time
since
i
tried
the
regular
arrogant
bastard
but
i
remember
it
being
much
different
the
oak
really
adds
a
lot
of
complexity
but
at
the
same
time
takes
away
from
the
spotlight
a
lot
of
the
character
that
i
liked
about
the
regular
cant
see
myself
drinking
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
sitting
but
either
way
good
stuff
this
american
strong
ale
poured
a
medium
amber
color
from
the
firkin
small
sized
white
foamy
head
the
aroma
is
caramel
malt
earthy
hops
and
a
bunch
of
oak
a
medium
to
full
bodied
american
strong
ale
the
malts
are
caramel
and
fruity
the
hops
are
grapefruity
and
floral
the
oak
flavors
are
mostly
in
the
back
end
and
the
finish
yeah
its
double
bastard
and
all
that
implies
but
the
oak
aging
has
mellowed
the
beer
a
little
the
oak
and
malts
go
well
together
here
another
beer
that
does
very
well
as
a
live
firkin
ale
very
smooth
taste
nice
soft
carbonation
mouthfeel
is
full
finish
is
clean
and
crisp
aftertaste
is
bitter
12oz
brown
bottle
from
asix
pack
i
purchased
while
visiting
dc
this
summer
pours
a
hazy
meduim
brown
with
a
creamy
2
finger
head
great
longevity
and
beautiful
lace
lovely
citrus
hop
aromas
but
not
overwhelming
behind
the
hop
is
a
just
right
malt
smells
mixed
with
a
hint
of
yeast
upon
the
first
sip
the
creaminess
of
it
is
beautiful
the
initial
malt
flavors
fade
somewhat
quickly
into
the
hops
imho
the
hops
a
bit
sharp
nice
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
it
could
stand
some
aging
to
completely
smooth
it
out
but
it
is
still
an
excellent
beer
taste
mmmm
its
definitely
of
ab
pedigree
but
the
oak
aging
settles
it
down
a
bit
providing
some
tannins
and
vanilla
the
slightest
hint
of
wood
im
not
going
to
say
it
has
refined
ab
but
it
seems
a
bit
more
complex
shady
more
an
enigma
if
possible
the
hops
are
hefty
and
well
oiled
the
mouth
is
hefty
and
lively
and
the
joy
its
a
great
drinkin
beer
everything
is
quite
excellent
perhaps
just
not
exquisite
this
was
everything
i
thought
it
would
be
and
more
the
pour
was
a
semicloudy
dark
red
colour
with
a
thick
tightly
knit
sand
coloured
head
head
was
easily
a
finger
and
a
half
perhaps
two
fingers
thick
and
stayed
in
place
for
some
time
it
looked
like
something
out
of
an
ad
really
smell
was
dominated
by
hops
period
however
it
was
a
sweet
smell
and
not
sweet
malt
though
malt
was
present
the
only
other
beer
i
can
think
of
right
off
that
had
this
powerful
sweet
hops
smell
is
3fs
dreadnaught
i
have
had
several
brews
that
had
that
but
only
those
two
so
assertively
taste
too
is
commanded
by
hops
with
little
noticeable
malt
to
me
i
know
its
there
though
this
is
certainly
a
brew
for
the
hop
lover
im
not
a
huge
american
hops
fan
but
i
still
appreciate
and
enjoy
this
immensely
mouthfeel
is
fairl
heavy
but
right
where
it
needs
to
be
imo
a
fine
ale
indeed
oakey
dokey
the
bastard
has
busted
my
balloon
knot
as
if
the
motherfucker
wasnt
nasty
enough
now
he
takes
a
bath
in
oak
tea
he
wears
a
polluted
cloud
of
a
head
and
a
subsiding
period
of
a
dress
burnt
caramel
covered
shards
of
dock
wood
splinter
the
tongue
burnt
sugars
become
slightly
bitter
over
cinnamon
swirl
toast
the
sonofabitch
offers
me
a
slice
of
vanilla
ice
cream
cake
at
the
end
with
no
reach
around
in
sight
im
rollin
with
the
bastard
goddamit
and
your
ass
is
smellin
sweet
great
beer
very
complex
taste
loads
of
hops
that
are
citrusy
and
herbally
big
malt
backbone
with
sweet
caramel
and
a
touch
of
vanilla
from
the
oak
and
a
fruity
aftertaste
goes
down
very
easy
a
damn
good
beer
too
bad
its
not
available
here
and
this
is
my
last
one
from
a
trip
to
vegas
drinkability
the
richness
of
this
beer
not
to
mention
the
price
tag
do
not
exactly
meld
with
a
session
type
beer
but
i
could
easily
drink
myself
into
a
cashless
stupor
with
this
one
worth
the
hype
drinkability
deceptively
drinkable
if
youre
a
fan
of
hoppier
beers
no
cloying
aspects
to
this
brew
just
a
spotlightshowcase
of
an
already
great
beer
in
the
arrogant
bastard
md
a
creamy
and
smooth
feel
and
very
drinkable
alcohol
is
surprsingly
well
masked
given
the
higher
abv
drinkability
a
very
tasty
spin
on
an
old
classic
highly
recommended
to
all
the
arrogant
bastard
lovers
i
drink
it
everyday
one
a
day
just
what
you
would
expect
from
oaked
ab
fantastic
dthe
more
i
drank
the
more
the
oak
came
through
and
might
discourage
drinking
more
than
2
but
i
sure
would
enjoy
those
2
really
like
this
beer
the
ale
poured
a
deep
amber
red
into
my
english
pint
pub
glass
forming
a
good
sized
rocky
head
that
quickly
dissipated
what
little
aroma
there
was
brought
to
mind
warm
caramel
very
malty
taste
is
where
this
brew
surprised
me
in
contrast
to
its
siblings
smack
you
in
the
head
assertiveness
oaked
arrogant
bastard
presents
a
wellblended
sum
of
its
substantial
parts
a
strong
caramel
malty
backbone
blends
subtly
with
the
hops
there
is
a
faint
undertone
of
oak
that
ties
together
the
disparate
parts
in
a
chewy
dare
i
say
smokey
harmony
for
as
strong
an
ale
as
this
is
you
certainly
dont
feel
it
it
might
be
better
to
call
this
a
sneaky
bastard
the
mouthfeel
is
very
slick
i
probably
wouldnt
have
many
due
to
the
extreme
dry
bitterness
but
thats
just
me
i
really
want
to
try
the
unoaked
version
of
this
beer
i
have
a
feeling
i
really
will
like
it
the
oak
aging
did
wonders
for
the
taste
i
love
the
original
but
this
version
is
much
tastier
if
you
ever
get
a
chance
pick
one
up
as
of
august
2007
they
are
creating
this
brew
year
round
so
hopefully
you
will
be
able
to
find
one
in
your
area
a
dark
fruit
taste
mixed
with
some
oakiness
hit
my
tongue
first
there
is
some
sweetness
in
there
caramel
i
believe
and
the
hops
do
come
through
although
not
as
powerful
as
some
other
stone
bc
brews
a
mediumbodied
beer
full
is
stretching
it
that
goes
down
extremely
smooth
and
hearty
i
have
to
have
this
again
drinkabiliy
is
not
high
for
me
since
it
is
pretty
strong
on
the
taste
buds
but
the
oak
does
make
it
smoother
and
more
complex
a
good
one
to
try
no
doubt
oak
aging
adds
complexity
and
balance
outshining
the
original
bastard
d
a
good
drink
by
itself
a
little
to
sweet
to
drink
in
multiples
but
was
very
wine
like
and
should
be
sipped
and
savored
like
one
i
dont
like
the
marketing
of
this
beer
the
whole
you
wont
like
this
beer
its
too
complex
for
you
approach
doesnt
work
for
me
i
wanted
to
not
like
this
beer
but
its
really
good
and
i
like
it
this
version
of
the
bastard
is
amazing
hands
down
i
love
the
regular
bastard
but
this
really
blows
the
regular
bastard
away
the
pour
is
a
little
darker
than
the
chestnut
brown
its
more
rich
not
quite
a
brown
but
not
a
chestnut
brown
it
has
a
two
finger
tan
head
that
wacks
your
nose
with
an
oak
and
grain
smell
you
can
also
catch
the
hops
and
malts
but
the
oak
is
the
dominant
the
taste
is
amazing
almost
like
the
bastard
but
with
the
oak
flavor
sealed
in
the
oak
gives
this
beer
more
of
an
earthy
feel
the
mouthfeel
is
hoppy
and
smooth
again
if
you
love
hops
the
drinkability
is
great
drink
em
if
ya
got
em
d
very
nice
brew
from
the
fellows
over
at
stone
similer
to
dfh
immort
imo
but
just
not
as
strong
the
woodyness
limits
the
drinkibility
in
my
case
but
none
the
less
a
fine
selection
skal
parks
a
dark
amber
good
clarity
and
a
half
inch
of
offwhite
dense
head
aromas
lean
towards
the
pine
woody
hop
notes
with
the
oak
taking
a
brighter
stance
like
fresh
cut
wood
than
most
oaked
beers
the
smell
of
a
pine
sapling
is
just
overwhelming
everything
else
though
it
is
quite
nice
on
the
palate
the
chinook
hops
really
dominate
and
that
signature
pine
like
smell
transfers
over
to
the
mouth
as
well
there
is
certainly
oak
in
this
beer
given
is
sweet
vanilla
flavors
i
think
this
style
certainly
is
well
served
with
oaking
and
it
really
compliments
it
overall
id
say
i
have
to
prefer
this
to
the
regular
ab
unfortunately
its
quite
cost
prohibitive
d
this
is
a
solid
beer
but
so
far
has
been
the
most
disappointing
stone
beer
ive
tried
i
wanted
knockyousocksoff
good
this
was
merely
good
d
this
one
you
can
drink
all
night
amazing
what
a
little
oak
does
for
this
beer
d
this
is
a
very
good
beer
and
i
get
the
subtle
differences
between
the
original
but
its
not
my
favorite
representation
of
the
style
overall
a
very
very
good
brew
the
oak
brings
the
ab
craziness
down
a
notch
and
makes
one
of
the
most
wellbalanced
extreme
beers
ive
ever
had
the
oak
does
not
come
through
immediately
in
the
taste
it
starts
out
similar
to
normal
arrogant
bastard
with
the
malts
hitting
you
upfront
and
the
bittering
hops
coming
through
strong
the
finish
though
is
what
really
distinguishes
it
the
oak
really
comes
through
on
the
finish
and
lingers
nicely
along
with
the
alcohol
it
has
a
nice
medium
mouthfeel
which
fits
nicely
with
the
style
and
the
carbonation
is
appropriate
giving
it
a
nice
mouthfeel
it
is
definitely
an
enjoyable
beer
but
im
not
completely
sure
if
it
is
worth
the
extra
cost
over
the
standard
ab
i
was
very
impressed
with
my
first
oaked
arrogant
bastard
its
strong
in
all
areas
and
i
especially
appreciate
its
color
now
im
really
eager
to
try
regular
a
b
it
was
a
great
break
from
all
the
uberhopped
beers
of
late
as
the
malt
and
oak
aging
characteristics
really
shined
on
this
one
drinkability
is
moderate
alcohol
is
moderate
but
flavor
is
fairly
strong
it
definitely
drinks
easy
but
mass
consumption
is
definitely
limited
ab
is
the
watermark
for
hopfocused
but
balanced
strong
ales
i
dont
really
see
the
oak
doing
a
lot
here
but
there
are
some
nuances
where
it
comes
through
regardless
it
is
delicious
notes
i
love
this
beer
the
malt
in
this
beer
is
so
round
and
the
hops
clean
up
so
nicely
it
sits
so
nicely
on
the
pallet
at
the
end
and
the
aftertaste
is
very
enjoyable
as
well
this
beer
is
absolutely
fantastic
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
nonic
glass
wow
pours
a
deep
copper
color
with
a
one
inch
light
brown
head
that
disappears
and
leaves
a
layer
of
lacing
on
the
glass
their
is
a
nice
citrus
nose
with
some
caramel
malt
that
leaves
a
faint
oak
scent
at
first
you
can
taste
the
malt
with
some
caramel
then
quickly
goes
over
to
the
citrus
hops
and
finish
dry
and
leaves
a
pleasant
bitter
aftertaste
with
a
hint
of
oak
nice
carbonation
that
goes
down
easily
and
leaves
only
a
slight
oily
feeling
on
the
tongue
if
this
beer
wasnt
so
expensive
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
excellent
beer
very
drinkable
due
to
the
oak
rounds
it
out
some
soft
sweetness
chalk
vanilla
come
through
in
a
good
way
and
finish
is
balanced
as
well
md
fabulous
bitter
aftertaste
smooth
going
in
neither
syrupy
or
watery
plenty
of
flavor
in
each
sip
just
enough
complexity
to
have
some
fun
while
sipping
but
the
characteristic
flavor
never
wavers
i
really
like
this
beer
nice
to
have
a
wood
aged
beer
that
is
not
a
stout
or
aged
in
a
liquor
barrel
the
oak
is
perfect
with
this
beer
does
not
overpower
and
adds
some
mellowness
and
complexity
great
beer
pours
a
reddish
color
with
plenty
of
sparkling
bubbles
throughout
the
body
head
is
a
rich
color
of
off
white
with
plenty
of
frothy
creamy
foam
sitting
on
top
of
this
sparkling
beauty
aroma
is
ripe
with
rich
fruit
notes
and
plenty
of
woodsy
flavors
smell
is
hop
strong
but
has
a
relaxed
feeling
with
all
the
oak
textures
that
come
through
taste
is
very
delicious
with
plenty
of
malt
sweetness
mixed
with
a
vanilla
hoppy
experience
mouth
feel
is
incredibly
silky
smooth
for
such
an
ipa
treat
d
very
tasty
goes
down
quite
easily
not
too
filling
nice
kick
i
always
have
high
expectations
for
stone
beers
and
they
have
yet
to
disappoint
me
with
this
beer
i
was
very
interested
to
see
what
difference
the
oak
aging
would
make
on
an
already
great
beer
it
seems
to
me
that
it
took
a
little
bit
of
the
harshness
out
and
made
an
excellent
beer
even
better
oily
hop
resin
and
a
bit
of
a
cloying
mouthfeel
i
like
big
ipas
but
this
is
not
as
drinkable
as
i
would
like
im
a
fan
of
stone
but
this
is
just
a
bit
too
strong
and
the
drinkability
really
isnt
there
d
this
is
the
second
time
i
have
tried
this
beer
and
both
times
i
have
thought
that
the
wood
chip
aspect
was
just
too
much
worth
a
shot
for
sure
though
this
is
a
beer
that
i
could
make
an
evening
out
of
several
of
these
with
good
cheese
with
friends
and
good
conversation
doesnt
get
much
better
great
beer
i
am
very
glad
i
picked
up
another
sixer
in
colorado
as
this
is
a
damn
tasty
beer
i
intend
to
age
some
of
the
other
bottles
and
see
how
they
turn
out
as
well
on
that
note
i
had
taste
of
a
4
year
old
magnum
of
oaked
ab
and
it
was
amazing
now
this
is
an
american
strong
ale
big
bold
and
completely
out
there
d
so
good
but
a
little
too
hyped
very
smooth
and
drinkable
overall
this
was
to
me
an
average
beer
at
best
my
review
for
the
double
bastard
was
well
below
the
average

tasted
on

one
of
my
favorite
beers
highly
recommended
d
not
too
heavy
higher
alcohol
hops
linger
good
could
not
drink
too
much
just
found
this
beer
at
my
local
pick
a
pack
omega
pizza
at
22nd
and
south
phillywell
worth
a
visit
for
good
selection
decent
food
and
friendly
staff
by
the
way
threw
it
in
at
the
end
instead
of
a
philly
pale
and
very
glad
i
did
amber
color
not
a
lot
of
head
but
a
big
hoppyoaky
nose
and
a
full
mouth
this
is
a
big
beer
with
mucho
character
a
touch
dry
but
this
did
not
take
away
from
its
delivery
because
of
its
bigness
and
its
7
2
not
an
ideal
session
beer
definitely
a
new
regular
though
highly
recommended
ive
always
thought
that
aging
was
nice
but
not
really
worth
the
price
this
one
might
be
an
exception
its
quite
nice
i
love
stone
brews
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
deep
red
almost
looks
like
a
barleywine
smells
like
orange
peel
and
alcohol
cant
quite
pick
anything
out
of
the
nose
or
from
the
taste
taste
is
relatively
complex
very
well
balanced
between
the
malts
and
the
hops
its
definitely
not
as
hoppy
as
i
though
it
would
be
overall
a
very
solid
brew
enjoyed
this
beer
on
12508
poured
a
very
dark
copper
with
a
thin
brown
head
bubbles
cling
to
the
side
of
the
glass
the
the
head
falls
a
bit
fruity
in
the
nose
with
some
sweeter
overtones
not
as
much
hoppiness
as
i
was
expecting
but
it
wasnt
overbearing
which
is
a
plus
had
some
overtones
that
reminded
me
of
bakers
chocolate
as
well
as
some
smokiness
the
body
was
a
bit
more
on
the
heavy
side
and
there
was
a
bit
too
much
carbonation
i
probably
couldnt
drink
more
than
one
at
a
time
but
i
could
see
it
being
paired
quite
nicely
w
some
ben
jerrys
drinkability
not
greatly
drinkable
there
was
once
a
time
when
i
could
go
to
a
bar
and
drink
nothing
but
the
bastard
but
i
think
time
has
run
its
course
on
me
and
no
longer
will
the
bastard
set
me
free
i
love
other
beers
from
stone
but
arrogant
has
eluded
me
in
my
old
age
even
on
oak
and
with
age
i
cant
say
that
this
is
the
best
beer
in
town
anymore
not
difficult
to
drink
a
few
of
these
i
remember
when
i
worked
at
a
restaurant
that
had
this
on
tap
briefly
people
who
didnt
like
the
regular
aba
loved
the
oaked
aba
it
took
some
of
that
initial
harshness
out
of
the
beer
both
beers
are
great
though
heres
another
epic
beer
from
the
brewers
at
stone
brewing
co
out
in
california
it
poured
into
my
crystal
tasting
snifter
with
a
nice
foamy
head
that
quickly
dissipated
there
was
a
good
bit
of
lacing
on
the
inside
of
the
glass
the
aroma
was
nice
and
woody
along
with
a
fresh
pinch
of
hops
the
oak
chips
do
a
wonderful
job
of
drying
out
the
initial
a
b
the
taste
is
sublime
a
mellow
mixture
of
vanilla
and
toffee
with
a
nice
hop
bitterness
this
is
a
truly
awesome
brew
worthy
of
trying
the
only
question
is
are
you
worthy
of
trying
it
overall
this
is
a
nice
brew
its
very
rich
and
complex
another
fantastic
stone
product
d
very
pleasant
brew
with
a
complex
and
varied
taste
outstanding
appearance
and
excellent
mouth
feel
it
is
a
bit
overhopped
for
my
taste
but
like
other
stone
products
this
beer
balanced
a
massive
hop
presence
with
other
strong
flavors
d
a
very
slow
drink
one
would
be
my
limit
very
unique
twist
on
what
is
probably
one
of
the
best
beers
out
there
arrogant
bastard
must
try
for
any
stone
fan
drinkability
as
with
the
traditional
aba
depends
on
ones
tolerance
for
hops
malt
yeast
which
knock
you
over
the
head
with
their
presence
for
myself
and
many
others
its
a
muchwelcome
presence
in
the
beer
world
almost
thinner
bodied
seaming
to
its
regular
counterpart
still
reddish
brown
with
a
somewhat
muted
drylysweet
malt
smell
and
light
hops
taste
though
was
lighter
more
muted
and
much
dryer
and
chalkier
especially
in
respect
to
the
bitterness
the
oak
seems
to
have
magnified
the
things
i
didnt
like
about
the
original
not
for
me
d
the
mouthfeel
really
throws
off
this
beer
i
really
like
the
regular
one
though
appearance
is
dark
brown
with
a
moderate
amount
of
foam
smells
of
oak
and
spices
taste
was
somewhat
disappointing
the
oak
flavor
dominates
everything
else
there
was
a
bit
of
spices
maybe
some
cinnamon
in
there
but
overall
the
flavor
was
on
the
weak
side
aside
from
the
oak
its
hard
to
believe
this
is
the
case
with
a
stone
beer
who
make
some
of
the
best
ive
tasted
but
this
one
wasnt
all
that
impressive
it
was
ok
to
drink
while
taking
my
time
but
i
wouldnt
have
wanted
another
one
anytime
soon
d
great
beer
that
is
dangerously
drinkable
d
a
boozy
and
intensely
oak
flavored
ale
bery
tasty
w
plenty
of
hops
and
flavor
yet
not
the
most
drinkable
beer
for
my
taste
this
was
paired
w
a
salad
my
brother
made
w
tons
of
ginger
and
lime
w
cilantro
and
scotch
bonnets
there
was
also
a
garlic
aioli
w
raw
egg
dijon
mustard
and
chives
with
redskin
roasted
potatos
which
was
even
more
intense
when
paired
w
this
ale
my
brother
tried
to
burn
my
mouth
w
a
fiery
orange
habanero
in
the
dressing
and
the
oaked
bastard
seemed
tame
next
to
his
fullon
ginger
lime
dressing
as
i
move
it
around
in
my
mouth
it
feels
like
a
party
of
malted
hops
and
barley
is
exploding
my
mouth
a
great
creamy
feeling
flows
down
my
throat
i
can
still
taste
the
beer
in
my
mouth
30
seconds
to
one
minute
later
a
great
beer
i
would
love
a
case
of
this
to
store
drinkability
is
great
but
for
the
alcohol
content
i
could
drink
these
all
night
again
i
really
like
this
beer
i
pick
up
the
oak
immediately
but
think
that
its
too
raw
its
almost
like
chewing
on
an
oak
chip
if
you
favor
a
good
whiskey
check
this
stuff
out
okay
its
a
nice
beer
and
fun
to
compare
to
the
original
definitely
recommended
to
try
but
for
me
it
probably
wont
repeat
in
my
fridge
too
often
especially
for
the
price
d
another
solid
beer
from
stone
i
really
like
the
oak
flavors
but
the
ageing
on
the
arrogant
bastard
makes
that
part
a
little
worse
but
it
is
still
a
great
beer
d
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
but
it
was
definitely
a
sipper
a
nice
beer
to
savor
with
a
little
time
on
your
hands
to
pick
up
all
the
subtle
nuiances
d
yes
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
d
another
home
run
by
stone
i
love
stone
brewery
aroma
is
moderate
hops
of
equal
parts
flowers
and
grapefruit
there
is
also
oak
vanilla
and
something
peppery
to
the
smell
pours
a
quite
nice
amberred
with
a
creamy
head
the
appearence
gets
a
5
from
me
for
the
absolutely
outstanding
lacing
taste
is
nice
subtlely
bitter
hops
good
goes
down
well
with
a
creamy
texture
and
soft
carbonation
will
buy
again
a
very
tasty
american
strong
ale
id
like
to
try
it
against
the
regular
arrogant
bastard
just
to
get
a
real
feel
for
the
oak
highly
drinkable
and
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
drinkablility
i
managed
to
handle
only
a
few
of
these
before
it
was
just
too
much
which
was
probably
for
the
best
definitely
a
good
beer
for
people
wanting
to
try
out
the
subtleties
of
what
oak
can
do
to
a
beer
this
was
a
perfect
celebratory
beer
after
my
alma
mater
saint
josephs
routed
villanova
by
22
perfect
d
i
could
probably
drink
this
until
i
couldnt
stand
big
improvement
over
the
already
tasty
original
taste
is
mainly
contributed
by
the
hops
strong
piney
bite
woodiness
comes
through
no
doubt
contributed
from
the
oaked
aspects
good
bitter
aftertaste
that
makes
you
pucker
enjoyable
though
i
think
i
prefer
the
original
more
the
original
is
just
more
bold
yet
balanced
this
one
just
has
everything
too
subdued
in
comparison
pours
a
slightly
hazy
brown
color
thick
offwhite
head
excellent
head
retention
aroma
seems
malty
at
first
but
as
it
warmed
slightly
the
hops
came
out
with
a
vengeance
a
faint
woodsy
aroma
rounds
out
the
smell
the
hops
seem
surprisingly
more
subdued
than
i
expected
which
is
balanced
nicely
between
a
malty
flavor
and
the
oak
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
slightly
drying
on
the
finish
just
the
right
amount
of
aftertaste
very
drinkable
all
the
flavors
and
aromas
blend
nicely
i
enjoyed
this
much
more
than
regular
ab
had
to
try
this
one
pours
a
deep
hazy
orangebrown
w
a
thin
light
tan
head
which
dissipates
rather
quickly
leaving
a
decent
amount
of
lacing
in
my
pint
a
strong
citrus
hop
aroma
w
some
darker
grainy
malt
undertones
a
crisp
hop
bite
initially
followed
by
a
nuttycaramel
flavor
a
faint
oak
presence
as
well
an
excellent
malt
to
hop
ratio
a
med
body
w
decent
co2
well
balanced
with
the
flavor
a
decent
brew
though
id
have
trouble
drinking
more
than
couple
less
arrogant
perhaps
but
the
smoothing
of
flavors
makes
for
an
even
better
beer
very
nice
drinkability
well
one
is
enough
at
a
time
it
would
be
great
with
spicy
chicken
wings
and
yes
i
will
buy
it
again
i
think
a
more
appropriate
name
for
this
beer
would
be
half
a
bastard
nice
and
smooth
very
quaffable
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
oak
in
my
beer
unless
it
is
a
bourbon
barrel
so
this
one
was
a
tad
hard
for
me
to
drink
as
i
tasted
no
bourbon
at
all
just
wood
and
hops
but
for
what
it
is
it
is
okay
i
wouldnt
choose
to
drink
it
again
over
all
the
other
choices
though
for
someone
who
described
arrogant
bastard
ale
as
the
owsley
acid
of
beer
i
feel
like
a
traitor
doing
this
review
i
fear
that
the
oak
flavoring
has
changed
this
to
some
strange
hopflavored
bourbon
stuff
all
i
could
taste
was
bourbon
i
dont
like
bourbon
at
all
yet
still
wet
a
combination
few
get
right
the
bitter
body
makes
for
a
bit
of
a
slow

5drinkability
i
could
drink
a
couple
of
these
in
the
night
without
getting
tired
of
it
oaked
ab
is
basically
a
smoother
version
of
the
standard
arrogant
bastard
while
i
like
the
original
theyd
like
you
to
buy
into
the
intimidation
factor
big
big
taste
lots
of
wood
in
there
almost
as
much
pine
as
oak
grapefruit
some
malt
to
balance
it
and
other
citrus
flavors
cant
think
of
a
better
beer
to
get
a
sixpack
of
i
found
the
flavor
far
less
overwhelming
than
the
normal
a
bastard
i
dont
know
what
it
is
about
stone
brewing
but
i
love
everything
they
make
i
even
keep
a
half
barrel
of
something
they
make
on
tap
at
all
times
the
beer
pours
a
ruby
red
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
lasts
the
aroma
is
great
it
has
a
smooth
and
mellowing
scent
that
boasts
of
pale
crystal
and
roasted
malts
along
with
a
generous
amount
of
hops
and
a
mild
oak
aroma
the
taste
is
good
it
has
an
aggressive
wood
flavor
up
front
as
well
as
in
the
finish
it
blends
well
with
the
bold
malt
and
hop
profile
the
hop
bitterness
lends
itself
well
to
the
oak
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
good
also
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
wonderful
version
of
an
already
great
beer
i
prefer
the
original
but
this
one
is
a
good
drinker
as
well
drinkability
as
much
as
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
i
think
it
would
be
impossible
for
me
to
have
more
than
one
a
night
or
even
a
week
perhaps
after
tonight
and
the
other
beers
i
tried
my
mouth
needs
a
while
to
recover
this
beer
is
amazing
and
if
you
have
the
chance
to
get
your
hands
on
it
go
for
it
it
takes
an
awesome
thing
and
makes
it
completely
different
go
stone
dhighly
drinkable
until
the
abv
decides
youve
had
enough
cant
wait
until
stone
finally
decides
to
show
their
pretty
face
in
wisconsin
this
poured
very
nicely
a
very
dark
amber
with
a
nice
tan
head
smell
is
extremely
hoppy
with
a
slight
aroma
of
something
different
im
thinking
its
the
oak
the
flavor
is
almost
pure
hops
but
the
finish
contains
this
almost
smoky
aroma
definitely
unique
its
aggressively
bitter
which
isnt
totally
a
bad
thing
but
can
be
a
bit
much
put
simply
you
have
to
be
in
the
mood
for
something
like
this
but
if
you
are
theres
very
little
else
out
there
that
rivals
this
nice
ruby
bronze
color
with
the
expected
sticky
off
white
head
smell
of
citrus
and
pine
and
yes
there
is
some
woody
oakyness
in
the
background
taste
is
bitter
up
front
slightly
grapefuit
but
most
noticable
is
the
pine
this
is
followed
by
the
oak
that
serves
to
smooth
things
out
lots
to
chew
on
in
this
one
the
first
one
i
had
i
didnt
really
think
the
oak
was
doing
much
but
smooting
things
out
now
on
the
second
one
a
few
weeks
later
im
really
getting
a
full
oaky
wood
taste
what
can
you
say
another
excellent
beer
from
stone
i
havent
had
the
original
ab
in
a
long
time
so
i
cant
really
compare
this
to
that
one
either
im
getting
tougher
in
my
reviews
or
i
liked
that
one
a
little
better
poured
from
12oz
bottle
into
duvel
snifter
poured
a
brown
red
color
with
off
whit
head
with
good
retention
just
like
all
of
stones
beer
smell
pineapple
grapefruit
herbal
light
alcohol
taste
a
combination
of
grapefruit
pine
carmel
toasted
oak
mouth
feel
chewy
but
not
heavy
a
great
tasting
beer
but
i
like
the
double
bastard
more
than
the
oaked
but
the
oak
is
a
lot
smoother
than
the
regular
bastard
a
very
very
complex
beer
giving
sweet
highs
bitter
lows
and
everything
inbetween
i
didnt
find
much
difference
between
the
oaked
and
the
original
although
it
has
been
a
while
since
i
have
tried
the
latter
regardless
its
a
beer
thats
worth
your
while
i
love
it
and
so
will
you
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
georgeous
looking
beer
dark
reddish
brown
with
a
big
big
off
whitetan
head
that
leaves
an
enormous
ammount
of
lace
light
smell
of
piney
grapefruity
hops
some
nice
malt
and
its
all
mixed
in
and
blends
pretty
well
with
the
smokyoaky
tastes
the
same
pretty
well
blended
fairly
silky
smooth
mouthfeel
and
pleasure
drinking
glad
i
finally
got
to
try
this
one
dont
see
it
as
a
regular
in
my
rotation
but
delightful
none
the
less
pours
a
clean
deep
amber
color
with
a
tan
head
aromas
of
a
malty
hop
presence
in
the
taste
a
sweet
malt
a
small
dry
hop
and
smoother
than
regular
arrogant
bastard
a
small
bitter
mouthfeel
with
a
alcoholic
and
sweet
malt
aftertaste
feels
bigger
that
it
is
and
the
hops
are
not
as
big
nice
and
smooth
so
whats
the
next
version
of
the
arrogant
bastard
series
oaked
double
bastard
ale
well
i
very
much
enjoy
the
original
and
i
must
say
that
the
oak
is
a
nice
compliment
its
nicely
drinkable
and
is
no
problem
to
enjoy
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
its
certainly
a
nice
variation
of
the
original
although
i
dont
think
it
is
superior
nor
inferior
it
is
certainly
more
expensive
when
i
popped
the
top
of
this
beer
an
evil
looking
vapor
slowly
crept
from
the
bottle
pours
into
the
glass
with
a
moderate
tan
head
that
quickly
fades
aroma
of
vanilla
damp
malt
and
a

of
bourbon

flavor
is
dominated
by
the
oak
notes
dry
smoky
flavor
has
very
little
malt
sweetness
to
counteract
it
hop
bitterness
comes
in
eventually
but
still
plays
second
fiddle
to
the
wood
for
this
size
of
a
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
drinakbility
is
ok
but
id
take
regular
ab
db
or
really
anything
else
stone
has
to
offer
over
this
i
think
i
can
get
a
couple
more
if
anyones
intersted
in
trades
pretty
much
a
disappointment
not
a
heavy
beer
at
all
it
easily
belies
its
7
abv
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
drinkability
i
could
make
this
sessionable
the
oak
aging
mellows
this
beer
quite
a
bit
and
adds
some
nice
flavor
depth
pours
a
dark
yet
translucent
copper
amber
color
with
a
big
stiff
light
tan
head
that
resists
fading
nice
sheets
of
lacing
left
behind
the
smell
has
a
lot
going
on
you
get
a
sweet
floral
citrus
from
the
hops
with
a
vanilla
caramel
behind
it
mediumfull
bodied
the
mouth
feel
is
adequately
carbonated
with
a
tingle
of
hops
yet
mellow
with
almost
creamy
textures
full
flavored
the
taste
is
just
as
complex
citruspine
hoppiness
balanced
with
a
sweet
caramel
malt
and
cherry
vanilla
notes
a
notable
hop
bitterness
lingers
appropriately
a
really
nice
drinker
drinkability
well
i
didnt
care
for
it
the
oak
just
overshadows
the
good
smell
and
what
starts
out
as
a
good
taste
12
oz
bottle
small
offwhite
head
that
is
mostly
diminishing
pours
a
clear
amber
mild
citrus
hop
and
woody
aroma
the
initial
flavor
is
dominated
by
hops
the
oak
aged
taste
comes
on
the
back
end
kind
of
spicy
medium
body
creamy
texture
mild
carbonation
with
spicy
hoppy
finish
complex
beer
yet
drinkable
other
than
the
price
tag
would
have
no
problem
drinking
this
every
day
of
the
week
d
this
is
definitely
a
sipper
and
i
would
only
have
1
glass
in
a
night
but
certainly
delicious
and
worth
trying
drinkability
only
five
minutes
in
and
the
beer
is
half
gone
from
the
sampling
thats
the
best
sign
another
highly
recommended
beer
from
stone
d
smooth
and
unique
i
have
been
a
big
fan
of
oaked
ab
for
a
while
from
the
bottle
is
not
as
great
as
draftgrowler
but
this
is
still
a
highly
drinkable
strong
ale
especially
compared
to
ab
and
double
ab
the
alcohol
is
wellmasked
and
i
could
drink
several
in
a
session
with
no
qualms
i
am
sure
i
will
be
drinking
much
more
oaked
ab
in
the
future
i
like
this
one
but
personally
i
would
probably
choose
the
nonoaked
arrogant
bastard
over
it
i
had
this
at
a
tasting
awhile
back
and
wanted
to
have
it
on
a
fresh
palate
i
still
feel
that
while
the
oak
is
interesting
and
ive
had
barrelconditioned
brews
that
really
enhanced
the
flavors
it
almost
interferes
with
its
great
natural
taste
call
me
a
partypooper
i
suppose
still
in
all
its
a
great
beer
the
double
bastard
still
takes
it
all
of
the
three
though
overall
a
beer
that
you
drink
on
a
cool
night
in
a
bar
1
or
2
is
sufficient
just
picked
up
a
6pack
so
ill
let
the
other
5
settle
for
a
bit
and
see
what
happens
still
have
one
from
last
year
as
well
so
i
may
open
that
soon
to
compare
d
a
very
good
beer
a
changeup
on
the
original
arrogant
bastard
but
i
like
both
styles
very
much
overall
this
is
an
excellent
beer
and
another
great
example
of
stone
taking
a
style
to
the
next
level
with
an
invested
interest
in
balance
and
complexity
it
might
be
hard
to
drink
more
than
a
few
of
these
because
it
truly
is
an
assault
on
the
senses
but
in
a
good
way
good
clean
flavors
and
an
interesting
departure
from
normal
flavor
this
brew
poured
a
bubbly
dark
brown
very
active
and
spewed
out
the
earthy
malts
and
signature
stone
hop
profile
the
taste
was
very
different
than
i
had
expected
the
oak
took
on
a
mineral
quality
as
a
flavor
almost
metallic
but
not
unpleasant
the
aging
process
really
melds
the
piney
hops
the
aromatic
wood
together
like
drinking
the
liquid
flavors
of
an
ipa
combined
with
the
almost
cedarlike
properties
of
the
oak
very
nice
though
the
effect
on
my
tastebuds
was
was
irreversible
for
the
night
making
this
one
the
finale
for
any
future
beer
parties
m
surprisingly
smooth
and
creamy
and
nicely
refreshing
for
such
an
aggressive
beer
leaves
a
nice
tingle
in
the
mouth
pours
an
almost
pure
ruby
with
amber
almost
looks
like
a
brown
ale
nice
sized
head
that
dies
rather
quickly
and
laces
nicely
smells
are
less
potent
then
i
would
like
faint
caramel
and
vanilla
some
malt
orange
rind
tastes
as
it
smells
along
with
big
spicy
and
dry
hops
with
a
little
bite
the
characteristics
from
the
oak
are
apparent
feels
medium
in
the
mouth
with
perfect
carbonation
drinkability
is
off
the
charts
i
can
see
why
those
3litre
bottles
are
out
there
although
arrogant
bastard
in
an
of
itself
is
a
fine
brew
it
pales
in
comparison
to
this
one
very
smooth
and
not
rough
around
the
edges
nice
citrusy
flavor
with
possibly
some
cherryplum
going
on
and
lots
of
head
and
hops
a
beautiful
looking
beer
and
id
have
to
say
behind
nosferatu
the
best
american
strong
ive
ever
had
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
to
full
the
drinkability
was
very
good
the
bitterness
is
somewhat
tempered
and
a
it
is
a
little
more
interesting
than
the
regular
arrogant
bastard
drinkability
is
good
i
would
prefer
a
regular
arrogant
bastard
for
a
session
but
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
offering
with
great
flavor
depth
anyways
i
have
another
bottle
that
i
will
try
later
on
and
see
if
there
is
a
difference
but
as
this
bottle
went
it
was
a
solid
representation
of
a
stone
brew
yet
didnt
happen
to
get
anymore
wowness
then
expected
out
of
it
from
my
first
ontap
experience
drinkability
is
very
good
i
am
pleasantly
surprised
with
how
well
this
has
held
up
ill
probably
set
a
couple
of
these
aside
for
a
few
more
months
to
see
how
much
more
this
changes
very
interesting
and
enjoyable
interesting
twist
on
their
strong
ale
this
is
a
very
decent
oaked
brew
and
a
must
for
fans
of
the
bastard
overall
impression
talk
about
flavor
complexity
in
this
one
i
have
never
had
an
arrogant
bastard
ale
and
wasnt
expecting
a
huge
lingering
hop
bitterness
great
beer
and
oaky
hop
heads
enjoy
its
a
perfect
beer
for
an
arrogant
bastard
like
myself
beer
poured
a
reddish
brown
color
with
a
nice
sturdy
off
white
head
that
is
sustaining
well
nose
is
somewhat
fruity
malty
with
a
hint
of
citrus
the
boquet
gets
better
as
it
warms
taste
is
interesting
the
palate
is
greeted
by
heavy
oak
with
the
malts
and
slides
into
the
abs
familiar
hop
slam
finish
with
hints
of
citrus
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
smoother
than
the
original
ab
overall
drinkability
is
good
this
was
definitely
fun
to
try
and
a
very
good
beer
but
the
oak
is
a
tad
bit
too
much
for
me
personally
compared
to
ab
i
like
this
even
better
from
the
tap
than
the
bottle
a
very
well
composed
beer
and
an
example
of
good
oak
aging
highly
recommended
i
have
had
this
beer
twice
in
my
life
however
i
wanted
to
relate
an
incident
about
this
beer
a
friend
of
mine
was
recently
given
a
bottle
of
1997
oaked
arrogant
bastard
this
friend
of
mine
is
no
where
near
being
a
purveyor
of
fine
beers
as
his
favorite
beer
is
coors
light
sadly
to
say
after
drinking
one
drink
of
this
magnificent
ale
he
was
disgusted
by
its
flavor
and
then
he
proceeded
to
pour
it
all
down
the
drain
in
reality
he
should
have
poured
himself
down
the
drain
instead
obviously
when
he
told
me
this
i
nearly
flipped
out
and
then
i
chastised
him
for
his
recklessness
his
response
dude
its
only
beer
what
an
ignoramous
d
so
happy
i
decided
to
try
this
one
today
will
be
looking
forward
to
more
stone
brews
in
the
future
definitely
have
to
find
this
in
the
midwest
thanks
to
msbulldog25
for
this
brew
drinkability
it
is
far
easier
to
drink
than
one
would
expect
for
all
of
its
arrogance
i
expected
a
lot
more
flavor
and
a
bit
more
complexity
my
score
is
high
enough
to
tsay
this
is
a
really
good
beer
but
i
expected
more
especially
when
this
costs
nearly
3
dollar
per
12
oz
bottle
mouthfeel
is
decent
i
like
the
juiciness
but
have
to
take
some
off
because
of
the
high
perceived
astringency
drinkability
is
good
better
than
the
normal
bastard
i
have
a
3l
bottle
of
2005
oaked
ab
waiting
for
me
so
i
hope
the
drinkability
is
damn
good
drinkability
with
the
alcohol
percentage
coupled
with
the
palette
crushing
oak
drinking
more
then
one
12
ounce
bottle
in
a
sitting
wont
happen
i
will
drink
this
beer
againbut
this
is
a
onenight
treat
highly
recommended
overall
drinkability
of
this
beer
is
great
almost
a
session
beer
the
7
2
is
almost
unbelievable
for
a
beer
with
this
much
flavor
i
want
a
plate
of
cheese
and
fresh
fruit
i
want
another
bottle
or
three
there
is
a
certain
malty
vibe
in
oaked
ab
that
reminds
me
of
free
states
old
backus
barleywine
clearly
though
oaked
ab
is
a
bigass
malty
dipa
i
am
not
down
with
the
american
strong
ale
term
wtf
is
it
either
it
is
a
barelywine
or
a
dipa
simple
as
that
screw
labels
is
it
tasty
hell
yeah
is
it
drinkable
oh
hell
yes
i
havent
sat
down
and
reviewed
a
beer
this
good
in
a
long
time
i
needed
this
thank
you
buckeyenation
this
beer
was
great
anyway
recommended
wasnt
as
impressed
as
i
thought
id
be
overall
it
was
solid
nice
full
mouthfeel
low
carbonation
doesnt
overrun
the
flavors
overall
the
drinkability
is
superb
i
could
drink
this
all
the
time
its
less
upfront
than
the
original
and
a
bit
smoother
overall
without
the
harsh
hops
good
stuff
this
is
one
easily
quaffable
beer
a
12oz
bottle
simply
isnt
enough
taste
is
exceptional
and
complex
the
woody
oak
really
comes
through
nicely
flavours
reminiscent
of
port
and
some
raisin
piney
and
herbal
hops
that
go
into
a
lovely
caramel
malt
with
a
bit
of
vanilla
and
biscuit
in
the
back
cookielike
in
the
finish
and
perhaps
a
bit
grainy
balance
is
near
perfect
mouthfeel
is
less
dry
than
i
thought
it
would
be
and
the
carbonation
is
about
right
medium
to
mild
so
delicious
id
have
another
dangerous
as
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
in
my
opinion
another
wonderful
beer
from
stone
this
isnt
quite
as
good
as
regular
arrogant
but
id
like
to
give
this
oaked
another
shot
this
oab
is
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
the
regular
decent
beer
sampled
side
by
side
with
regular
arrogant
bastard
ale
like
you
could
call
it
regular
the
beer
poured
the
same
deep
amber
almost
brown
as
its
more
common
older
brother
with
a
similar
head
that
left
a
little
less
lacing
the
aroma
was
almost
identical
to
its
brother
caramel
malts
and
pine
hops
with
just
a
hint
of
oak
the
oak
in
the
taste
adds
a
truly
unique
quality
to
an
already
complex
beer
my
only
problem
is
it
adds
just
a
slight
astringency
to
the
mouthfeel
nothing
much
but
enough
to
keep
it
from
the
5
i
gave
its
brother
all
being
said
this
is
also
a
one
of
my
absolute
favorite
beers
but
i
rank
it
just
behind
the
real
deal
bottled
sample
shared
with
trevorwideman
murky
amber
in
colour
with
strong
aromas
of
dark
caramel
pine
white
grapefruit
vanilla
almond
and
a
hint
of
raisin
very
woody
in
the
mouth
both
fresh
cut
wood
and
bark
red
grape
skins
a
bit
of
port
probably
the
combination
of
the
caramel
and
grape
elements
with
a
cookie
like
malt
character
coming
through
near
the
finish
theres
a
citrus
fruit
woody
astringency
that
balances
out
the
malt
in
a
very
interesting
way
i
think
i
like
this
beer
a
bit
better
than
its
nonoaked
counterpart
thanks
trev
the
last
of
a
few
i
received
for
my
bombing
poured
an
almost
clear
brown
color
with
a
small
offwhite
head
that
left
some
lacing
as
i
drank
it
the
brew
has
a
piney
hop
smell
to
it
like
its
twin
brother
the
aroma
is
not
too
pronounced
the
taste
is
of
grapefruit
hops
a
slight
chocolate
malt
flavor
a
bit
of
rubbing
alcohol
im
not
sure
of
the
differences
between
the
oaked
and
nonoaked
i
would
need
to
drink
them
side
by
side
though
i
do
know
the
difference
from
the
double
its
hard
to
forget
the
double
the
feel
is
light
and
fizzy
and
leaves
a
bitter
aftertaste
that
lingers
around
this
is
good
as
a
sipper
but
when
i
take
a
big
gulp
the
bitterness
kills
me
good
for
one
or
two
a
nice
brew
but
ill
take
the
original
bastard
over
the
oaked
overall
impression
fantastic
beer
and
i
love
that
they
are
offering
it
at
least
occasionally
in
12
oz
bottles
glad
i
stocked
up
drinkability
as
the
regular
ab
this
one
is
very
very
tasty
definitely
a
beer
you
could
enjoy
copious
amounts
of
as
i
find
myself
drinking
it
faster
than
what
i
would
expect
excellent
version
of
a
excellent
beer
hazy
amber
sort
of
colora
muted
orange
is
more
like
it
good
enough
aromasome
woodiness
against
a
backround
of
hops
big
malty
taste
with
a
pleasant
tongue
stripping
level
of
hops
and
astringency
some
definate
oak
flavors
though
i
think
i
was
looking
for
more
good
body
very
drinkable
though
i
find
the
oakiness
detracts
from
being
the
regular
bastard
too
little
oak
and
too
many
expectations
maybe
bring
on
the
oaked
double
bastard
that
has
been
laid
down
a
year
or
two
a
really
fine
beer
reminded
me
of
a
barleywine
specifically
a
mixture
of
brooklyn
monster
ale
and
bigfoot
qualities
pours
a
very
cloudy
brown
color
with
a
good
size
tan
head
left
good
lacing
on
the
glass
i
was
expecting
a
bigfoot
celebration
ale
style
smell
but
the
aroma
was
fairly
mild
taste
was
very
good
a
little
maltiness
up
front
then
a
good
long
hops
blast
with
grapefruit
and
piney
flavors
very
much
like
bigfoot
the
follow
through
is
very
smooth
and
malty
like
monster
ale
my
first
sip
felt
thin
and
watery
all
cured
by
the
second
taste
smooth
rich
mouthfeel
and
great
tasting
throughout
have
to
rate
drinkability
good
has
all
the
flavor
of
monster
ale
and
bigfoot
with
a
much
lower
abv
i
wouldnt
say
no
to
a
second
one
highly
enjoyable
beer
from
stone
im
glad
they
decided
to
release
this
in
12oz
bottles
last
time
around
interesting
concept
decent
flavor
good
but
i
had
higher
hopes
i
wouldnt
be
able
to
put
away
a
sixer
of
these
while
watching
the
game
though
d
truely
an
enjoyable
brew
perfectly
balanced
and
comlex
the
subtle
oak
finish
was
the
winning
point
for
this
beer
insanely
drinkable
and
dangerous
highly
recommend
as
it
hits
your
mouth
this
is
definitly
different
bitter
isnt
as
floral
but
sharp
leads
to
a
very
raw
wood
meets
shoe
polish
kind
of
mouth
feel
it
is
odd
how
the
oak
brought
out
the
oil
in
the
hops
very
elementaly
woodsy
overall
i
think
this
one
drinks
better
on
the
colder
side
ill
stick
with
the
original
id
have
to
drink
arrogant
bastard
ale
and
oaked
ab
side
by
side
to
determine
how
much
they
actually
differ
my
guess
is
that
the
oak
chips
definitely
add
something
of
value
i
did
a
little
jig
when
i
found
out
that
stone
decided
to
release
this
beer
in

this

dont

one

said
its
an
enjoyable
ale

that
will
get
you
talking

the
beer
is
slightly

the
beer
has

this
is
a

and

beer
this

this
beer
is
a
mouthfull
the
arrogant
bastard
that
happened
to
be
oaked
poured
a
beautiful
dark
copperamber
hue
with
a
think
khaki
colored
head
lace
stuck
to
the
glass
throughout
the
entire
tasting
i
really
thought
this
would
have
a
powerful
overwhelming
smell
but
to
me
this
was
quite
subtle
the
smell
is
much
more
maltyoaky
than
the
normal
bastard
maybe
because
its
because
im
a
hophead
that
the
odor
doesnt
stand
out
to
me
taste
is
absolutely
amazing
mild
bitter
hops
bite
the
tongue
but
is
quickly
diminished
by
the
wonderful
maltyvanilla
oak
flavors
the
feel
is
quite
smooth
with
a
much
more
carbonated
feel
to
it
than
i
had
anticipated
very
drinkable
brew
i
was
quite
pleased
with
not
nearly
as
much
bite
as
arrogant
bastard
i
have
always
been
a
big
fan
of
the
original
bastard
and
have
never
had
much
experience
in
oaked
brews
but
i
actually
prefer
this
over
the
original
because
of
its
drinkability
i
plan
on
experiencing
more
oaked
brews
thanks
to
stone
definitely
give
this
one
a
try
if
you
have
the
chance
i
thought
this
beer
was
well
balanced
and
not
nearly
has
hoppy
as
the
regular
arrogant
bastard
the
aroma
was
a
bit
more
mild
than
i
thought
it
would
be
otherwise
a
very
tasty
brew
d
i
honestly
thought
this
brew
would
be
over
hyped
but
it
seriously
knocked
my
socks
off
one
of
my
new
favorite
brews
recommended
i
have
no
idea
how
someone
could
say
that
this
is
no
different
than
the
regular
ab
especially
when
this
beer
bears
only
a
superficial
reseblance
to
its
own
incarnation
of
a
few
months
ago
vastly
more
balanced
and
layered
again
not
better
just
different
d
now
i
dont
know
how
to
review
this
you
want
to
drink
this
beer
it
is
delicious
but
its
strong
and
big
and
i
will
be
more
than
content
with
this
12oz
bottle
its
not
all
that
drinkable
but
i
think
thats
kinda
the
point
as
much
as
i
loved
the
double
bastard
ale
i
guess
ill
never
care
much
for
its
little
brother
oaked
or
not
edit
after
trying
this
on
tap
i
have
to
say
that
its
worlds
better
a
nearly
masterpiece
actually
the
impression
i
get
is
that
the
oak
wood
chips
nullified
the
hops
removing
the
wonderous
abrasiveness
of
plain
ol
arrogant
bastard
still
a
good
beer
but
i
vastly
prefer
the
original
d
i
found
this
to
be
a
more
enjoyable
version
of
ab
the
addition
of
oak
chips
sands
off
a
lot
of
the
raggedness
of
ab
making
it
even
more
drinkable
i
liked
this
a
lot
similar
to
the
original
ab
but
different
enough
to
make
it
worth
seeking
out
on
its
own
looking
forward
to
the
2nd
bottle
but
ill
save
it
for
a
while
mouthfeeldrinkability
the
mouthfeel
on
this
one
is
medium
to
full
bodied
with
a
bit
of
a
drying
effect
that
i
assume
is
from
the
oak
the
drinkability
is
really
good
d
i
enjoyed
this
very
much
and
i
can
definitely
see
myself
drinking
more
than
one
in
a
setting
i
need
to
have
a
sidebyside
sampling
with
the
regular
arrogant
bastard
to
declare
an
outright
winner
as
time
as
gone
on
stone
beers
have
leveled
a
bit
for
me
the
ba
hype
the
reality
that
its
a
nationwide
micro
but
still
there
it
has
a
good
strong
piney
and
malty
aroma
the
beer
is
fairly
creamy
feeling
sweet
mango
with
pineygreen
notes
appearing
later
in
addition
there
are
toastedcaramel
malts
and
oak
that
is
more
of
a
presence
than
an
actual
flavor
even
in
its
greenness
but
with
a
great
malt
backbone
and
the
oakey
flavour
the
oak
is
defintely
there
but
not
overpowering
it
reminded
me
of
the
oak
in
old
yeti
i
think
it
really
matches
well
with
the
style
of
ab
mouthfeel
is
of
a
great
body
balanced
beer
that
will
appeal
to
both
beer
enthusiasts
and
casual
drinkers
alike
try
using
this
to
ween
your
friends
onto
more
adventurous
beers

i
would
probably
opt
to
drink
the
regular
that
being
said
for
sure
ans
still
worth
the
tiume
and
effort
to
come
by
it
but
it
definetly
wasnt
the
orgasmic
brew
i
had
expected
ill
save
one
bottle
for
aging
with
plentiful
delicate
lacing
aroma
is
lightly
woody

due
to
the
substantial

resins
flowing
down

drinkability
is

amazing
one
of
those
rounded
out
bastards
is
something
i
could
go
for
anytime
so
i
most
likely
wont
get
it
again
with
a
tag
of
oak
aging
the
oak
adds
more
character
but
also
mellows
the
bastard
some
but
overall
good
but
just
as
soon
have
a
regular
bastard
for

kind

was

that
was
quite
nice
the
texture

is
characteristic
of

when
paired

character

starts
to
become
noticeable
it
becomes
much
more
woody
with
a
pronounced
butteryoak
type
note
in
both
the
aroma
and
taste
but
it
still
does
not
dominate
the
overall

overall
this
is
an
average
strong
ale
for
me
the
aromas
had
some
promise
but
i
was
disappointed
in
the
taste
theres
not
enough
malt
to
balance
out
the
hops
i
thinks
its
too
hoppy
and
bitter
for
the
style
i
really
enjoy
a
few
of
stones
ipas
but
i
personally
feel
they
are
a
bit
overrated
as
a
whole
ill
probably
pass
on
this
one
from
now
on
cant
really
go
wrong
at

a
bomber
though
overall
this
is
a
bold
and

brew
has
sweet
malty
flavors
and
bitter
hops
for
a
great
combo
excellent
ale
malty
bitter
and

one
of
my
gateway
beers
into
the
craft
world
and
overall
an
outstanding
brew
from
one
of
the
titans
of
the
industry
o
the
faint
nose
makes
the
strong
hop
character
a
nice
surprise
very
good
and
flavorful
smells
great
overall
it
is
one
of
my
favorite
grab
and
go
beers
sweet
caramel
smell
good
balance
of
malt
and
hops
overall
this
is
a
bold
and
flavorful
brew
with
a
terrific
presentation
and
mouthfeel
the
hops
are
a
little
heavyhanded
for
my
tastes
but
its
stone
so
i
knew
what
i
was
getting
into
with
that
said
its
easy
to
see
why
this
is
one
of
their
flagship
brews
good
dark
copper
color
lacks
something
in
taste
seems
like
a
bit
of
a
burnt
raisin
finish
good
strong
ale
great
head
when
poured
into
a
pint
glass
from
a
bottle
overall
a
good
beer
but
not
my
favorite
stone
by
a
long
shot
dark
ruby
color
that
is
crisp
and
hazy
with
lots
of
lace
at
piney
hop
peach
pie
crust
caramel
toffee
citrus
slight
notice
of
alcohol
good
balance
with
an
edge
to
the
bitterness
medium
body
good
beer
hands
down
one
of
the
best
ipas
ive
ever
had
solid
beer
with
good
flavor
one
of
my
favorites
very
hard
hitting
and
flavorful
hated
it
when
i
first
tried
it
but
bought
it
a
few
more
times
as
my
pallet
grew
and
now
i
love
it
definitely
a
big
beer
its
very
bitter
but
the
malts
even
it
out
and
it
has
just
enough
grapefruit
in
the
aftertaste
to
keep
it
wellbalanced
im
getting
hints
of
dark
fruits
on
the
aftertaste
as
well
this
would
be
a
great
beer
to
have
with
a
hearty
german
food
meal
awesome
pure
and
hard
hitting
one
of
my
top
favorites
ive
had
this
beer
many
times
over
the
last
six
years
although
my
tastes
have
evolved
this
is
still
a
bold
flavorful
easy
drinking
ale
classic
stone
beer
that
i
can
enjoy
all
the
time
its
very
tasty
and
as
the
label
says
you
probably
wont
like
it
ha
very
good
beer
but
for
the
faint
of
heart
if
youve
never
had
this
style
before
the
first
sip
can
be
intimidating
its
a
beer
to
be
sipped
and
savored
not
chugged
highly
recommended
bottle
of
arrogant
bastard
drank
pours
a
clear
cooper
brown
color
with
a
two
finger
off
white
head
aroma
is
toffee
caramel
and
resin
taste
is
pine
resin
and
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
a
bit
of
an
oily
feel
overall
a
very
good
strong
ale
that
is
undeniably
stone
no
mistaking
it
overall
just
a
great
beer
every
time
i
drink
one
i
remember
just
how
damn
good
this
beer
is
really
stands
the
test
of
time
well
done
stone
this
ale
is
not
worthy
to
reach
my
stomach
actually
i
drank
the
whole
pint
poured
on
tap
it
is
unremarkable
given
verbiage
on
the
label
looked
like
muddy
water
had
nice
aroma
but
not
as
good
as
any
stone
ipa
aftertaste
was
poorly
balanced
bitterness
and
sweetness
cant
put
my
finger
on
it
lagunitas
brown
shugga
is
far
superior
what
a
surprise
stone
brews
are
usually
great
this
is
a
big
boy
beer
an
enjoyable
strong
ale
but
very
unique
with
a
lot
of
nuance
i
enjoyed
it
way
more
closer
to
room
temp
sweet
up
front
with
a
late
bitter
bite
way
after
the
finish
i
cant
believe
it
took
so
long
for
me
to
try
this
one
pretty
good
but
not
great
i
get
it
from
time
to
time
dont
take
my
advice
personally
im
just
not
much
of
a
fan
of
strong
ales
i
thought
this
one
was
just
pretty
good
not
great
their
ipa
beers
are
so
much
better
in
my
opinion
not
a
fan
of
the
overall
taste
not
for
the
price
at
least
ive
had
much
better
beers
than
this
though
it
was
highly
recommended
this
is
a
big
badass
beer
i
dont
have
much
to
add
to
the
previous
reviews
arrogant
bastard
looks
great
smells
good
and
has
layers
of
tastes
caramel
malts
candy
a
bit
of
coffee
and
cola
this
is
definitely
not
a
session
beer
it
kicks
you
right
in
the
teeth
then
smiles
at
you
for
what
it
is
its
good
kinda
lika
an
ipa
lots
of
hop
taste
little
citrus
poured
out
22
oz
bottle
in
goblet
not
all
that
good
to
me
similar
rich
malty
and
bitter
flavours
comes
off
a
little
abrasive
could
use
a
bit
more
sweet
clean
malt
tasty
but
not
overly
memorable
overall
i
will
admit
this
one
has
had
some
cellar
time
so
it
might
have
lost
some
hop
bitterness
i
remember
it
being
extremely
bitter
the
first
time
i
tried
it
i
do
not
get
that
this
time
around
its
pretty
well
balanced
over
all
and
not
nearly
what
the
experience
i
had
was
the
first
time
around
so
i
guess
i
have
lapped
this
one
in
its
arrogance
whos
the
arrogant
bastard
now
despite
not
being
a
style
i
would
drink
regularly
the
ipa
hunter
owed
it
to
himself
to
finally
get
around
to
reviewing
this
legendary
beer
i
like
stone
after
all
they
do
hops
and
they
do
it
well
getting
a
lot
of
freshbaked
bread
and
sugary
sweetness
on
the
nose
a
bit
like
raisin
bread
but
very
subdued
not
overwhelming
simply
complimentary
taste
follows
the
nose
but
theres
unmistakable
citrus
hops
on
the
finish
on
the
real
a
bit
prickly
on
the
tongue
while
not
being
exhausting
or
heavy
on
the
mouthfeel
theres
a
fine
line
between
arrogance
and
supreme
confidence
stone
knew
what
they
were
doing
with
this
one
i
havent
been
this
excited
while
drinking
a
nonipa
since
the
last
time
i
saw
lorna
morgan
rocking
some
tasteful
lingerie
larrrrrrge
cant
believe
i
havent
reviewed
this
yet
its
one
of
my
favorite
go
to
beers
very
malty
lots
of
fresh
citrus
fruit
and
a
lovely
dry
bitter
finish
fantastic
beer
very
reasonable
price
me
coming

the
balance
is
there
on
this
beer
the
nose
was
a
little
weak
and
i
am
not
getting
specific
flavor
elements
on
the
taste
overall
it
is
a
well
made
beer
i
would
drink
it
again
but
might
not
seek
it
out
i
think
that
since
it
is
10
days
from
expiration
it
may
have
lost
some
punch

this
is
not
a
beer
for
beginners
nor
the
faint
of
heart
i
am
fairly
new
to
the
beer
tasting
scene
and
this
is
very
strong
and
defiantly
way
out
of
my
league
i
read
the
reviews
and
wanted
to
try
it
out
its
gonna
be
a
while
before
i
try
this
one
again
but
considering
other
reviews
from
the
more
experienced
beer
drinkers
this
is
a
great
beer
one
of
the
best
beers
loved
this
one
the
bitterness
is
good
strong
but
not
obnoxious
or
unnecessarily
so
the
malt
profile
is
clean
balanced
with
a
slight
powdered
sugar
aftertaste
some
strong
ales
barleywines
are
too
sweet
for
my
taste
but
this
one
pulls
off
the
balance
nicely
hoppier
than
some
ipa
ive
tried
awesome
beer
looks
good
and
tastes
even
better
i
was
pleasantly
surprise
at
how
delicious
this
beer

this
beer

this

very

brewand
if
your
average
light
beer
drinker
tried

would

all
as
soon
as
i
crack
open
the
bottle
i
instantly
can
smell
the
hoppy
goodness
that
is
within
as
i
sip
the
beer
i
taste
notes
of
grapefruit
it
appears
to
be
a
dark
amber
like
color
and
it
definitely
goes
down
very
smooth
this
is
one
of
my
top
5
go
to
beers
thats
for
sure
very
complex
and
very
good
every
time
i
feel
that
my
tastebuds
need
their
asses
kicked
this
is
the
beer
that
i
buy
intensely
full
flavored
and
hoppily
bottled
arrogance
i
like
to
think
that
i
am
worthy
of
such
a
brutal
beer
from
time
to
time
very
coarse
both
in
taste
and
feel
heavy
blend
of
both
hops
and
malt
i
see
this
one
got
some
strong
ratings
but
its
not
for
me
given
that
so
many
people
seem
to
like
this
one
maybe
ill
try
it
again
in
a
year
or
two
as
my
tastes
continue
to
change
and
rerate
at
that
time
i
dont
even
wanna
write
a
full
review
i
just
want
to
say
about
this
is
like
mana
of
the
gods
and
every
time
ive
purchased
it
i
have
been
totally
satisfied
i
dont
even
flinch
despite
the
price
tag
drink
this
the
bitterness
is
accompanied
by
some
malty
and
citrusy
sweetness
so
no
onetrick
pony
great
with
barbecue
one
of
the
beers
that
got
me
into
crafts
always
good
i
preferred
the
oak
aged
variety
but
no
one
near
me
seems
too
carry
it
any
more
i
guess
im
truly
not
worthy
overall
complex
is
generally
a
word
bereft
of
true
meaning
but
if
you
want
to
get
an
idea
what
beer
drinkers
mean
when
they
say
its
complex
then
drink
this
the
tongueincheek
reference
to
being
unworthy
because
you
lack
the
sophistication
to
truly
appreciate
this
beer
actually
comes
through
i
like
it
i
am
very
impressed

a
really
good
beer
this
is
the
first
strong
ale
i
have
had
and
i
am
not
sure
why
this
is
not
considered
an
ipa
it
pretty
much
fits
that
bill
in
my
opinion
i
cant
think
of
a
time
where
this
would
serve
a
purpose
that
an
ipa
could
not
fill
in
never
the
less
a
good
impression
for
me
from
stone
as
this
is
my
first
offering
from
them

overall
this
has
been
one
of
my
favorites
for
a
long
time
whenever
i
go
to
the
grocery
store
for
another
haul
of
goodness
i
always
grab
this
if
you
have
never
tried
this
and
are
looking
for
a
pretty
strong
beer
i
would
recommend
you
give
this
a
go
overall
this
is
something
i
dont
usually
buy
anymore
cause
ive
had
it
alot
and
i
like
to
try
new
things
but
when
it
stands
alone
at
a
store
im
at
i
will
buy
it
and
i
always
enjoy
it
its
quite
bitter
but
my
palate
has
changed
over
time
and
its
rather
subdued
to
me
at
any
rate
its
a
good
beer
but
i
cant
quite
rate
it
as
high
as
others
i
confess
i
dont
get
this
beer
the
hops
are
too
onedimensional
for
it
to
be
a
hop
monster
and
theres
not
enough
fruit
in
here
to
make
this
a
really
good
strong
ale
what
you
end
up
with
actually
is
something
like
an
overhopped
american
pale
ale
not
exactly
bad
or
undrinkable
but
certainly
nothing
all
that
amazing
either
o
i
sound
like
a
waynes
world
episode
i
know
maybe
ill
come
back
to
this
one
again
someday
after
all
there
was
a
time
that
i
could
not
stand
ipas
either
parish
the
thought
i
know
but
for
now
well
you
guessed
it
im
not
worthy
and
im
ok
with
that
this
beer
leaves
an
impression
with
its
boldness
but
the
bitterness
is
very
strong
and
the
balance
is
lacking
the
flavors
dont
blend
as
well
as
i
like
happy
i
bought
but
wont
but
again
for
awhile
bomber
into
tulip
im
happy
that
with
all
the
hype
surrounding
this
beer
it
did
not
fail
to
live
up
darker
than
most
beers
i
drink
i
was
put
off
at
first
but
soon
grew
to
like
it
the
most
interesting
aspect
to
me
was
the
head
of
the
beer
being
a
tankhaki
almost
light
brown
color
really
cool
i
also
love
the
attitude
displayed
by
stone
they
brew
beer
for
people
like
me
who
think
that
opinions
are
fact
cuz
when
youre
right
youre
just
right
overall
a
great
beer
especially
for
lovers
of
hoppy
ales
the
hops
flavors
are
very
strong
but
dont
overpower
the
rest
of
the
flavors
not
a
good
introduction
for
those
not
accustomed
to
this
kind
of
brew
and
not
the
beer
to
start
the
night
out
with
if
youre
planning
on
drinking
more
than
one
there
was
a
shade
of
dry
bitterness
at
the
end
something
as
if
i
was
finishing
up
a
smooth
brown
whiskey
but
no
whiskey
overtones
here
has
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
great
tan
head
and
great
lacing
toasty
fruity
alcohol
smell
taste
strong
well
balanced
with
a
great
fruity
sweet
after
taste
goes
down
smooth
with
great
medium
heavy
body
fantastic
beer
o
this
is
a
beer
that
asks
for
and
deserves
attention
delicious
uncompromising
and
tough
it
is
a
compelling
drink
that
deserves
periodic
revisiting
o
this
is
a
really
good
american
beer
its
not
to
westcoast
hop
dominant
and
thats
coming
from
a
california
brewery
a
good
one
at
that
m
racy
acidity
light
bodied
overall
this
was
an
excellent
brew
kind
of
like
a
grownup
ipa
well
named
pretty
good
strong
ale
not
gonna
be
in
my
top
5
or
anything
but
i
enjoyed
it
overall
complex
balanced
strong
like
a
good
woman
overall
fantastic
beer
out
of
california
would
recommend
and
will
buy
again
beerandwhiskeyhq
com
serving
type
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
while
most
folks
seem
enamored
with
stones
ipas
and
dipas
which
are
good
i
would
take
their
stronger
maltier
beers
like
this
one
almost
like
a
barely
wine
really
solid
beer
the
stout
and
the
one
they
brew
on
oak
barrels
are
the
best
out
of
this
brewery
but
a
total
let
down
if
the
hop
is
so
strong
you
cant
pair
it
up
then
thats
telling
you
something
have
a
great
day
this
is
my
first
stone
brew
looking
forward
to
trying
more
looking
forward
to
adding
this
bastard
into
regular
rotation
in
my
beer
fridge
overall
this
is
probably
in
my
top
10
beers
im
suprised
i
dont
drink
it
more
often
stone
kills
it
every
time
o
once
this
beer
warmed
up
for
a
few
minutes
it
turned
into
an
incredible
brew
i
will
be
enjoying
this
again
and
again
letting
it
rest
a
few
minutes
first
before
drinking
o
pretty
good
but
i
much
prefer
double
bastard
this
beer
rocks
and
i
also
love
the
name
it
is
my
currently
my
favorite
beer
i
like
it
even
more
than
founders
breakfast
stout
or
santa
fe
imperial
java
stout
which
i
love
dearly
great
flavors
aftertaste
you
name
it
id
love
to
purchase
a
six
pack
but
have
yet
to
find
it
in
anything
other
than
a
bomber
if
something
in
the
universe
didnt
line
up
quite
right
and
i
could
have
only
one
beer
to
drink
forever
more
arrogant
bastard
ale
would
be
my
pick
an
outstanding
beer
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
glass
this
beer
had
a
lovely
caramel
appearance
and
a
nice
head
the
beer
had
a
nice
fruity
aroma
and
what
i
would
describe
as
a
strong
grapefriuty
flavor
very
enjoyable
stuff
and
justifiably
arrogant
this
beer
has
a
rich
taste
that
is
comparable
to
none
it
has
a
dark
amber
appearance
and
a
deliciousness
that
demands
your
attention
regardless
of
your
beer
drinking
preference
you
will
enjoy
this
beer
unless
of
course
budweiser
and
yuengling
are
your
chart
toppers
in
which
case
you
wouldnt
even
be
on
this
website
to
begin
with
because
your
palate
would
be
anything
but
educated
this
is
no
time
to
be
humble
there
is
no
pride
before
the
fall
at
stone
brewery
only
the
pride
in
knowing
that
if
you
try
this
beer
they
have
again
broadened
someone
elses
horizons
you
dont
have
to
sell
your
soul
to
the
devil
but
you
should
give
your
beer
money
to
the
stone
brewery
gargoyle
pours
of
a
caramel
color
and
strong
notes
of
hops
grapefruit
and
what
i
would
consider
zest
from
start
to
finish
this
says
stone
brewery
about
an
inch
and
12
head
that
sticks
around
for
most
of
the
entire
time
you
are
drinking
it
i
tried
it
chilled
rather
then
really
cold
and
noticed
the
some
of
the
flavors
were
getting
lost
drinking
this
beer
to
cold
overall
this
is
my
go
to
beer
when
i
go
out
and
pairs
perfectly
with
a
good
meaty
cheeseburger
i
am
not
worthy
o
an
excellent
american
strong
ale
because
the
characteristics
for
this
style
are
so
wide
of
a
range
it
absolutely
fits
the
style
even
though
the
abv
is
on
the
low
end
of
the
scale
a
excellent
ale
near
perfect
i
love
it
this
beer
has
the
right
to
call
itself
arrogant
bastard
in
my
humble
opinion
poured
a
rich
transparent
reddish
brown
with
a
halffinger
offwhite
head
receding
to
an
offwhite
ring
leaving
some
lacing
at
the
top
of
the
glass
rich
gorgeous
color
but
a
little
low
on
the
head
scents
of
caramel
toffee
some
brown
sugar
more
prominent
as
the
beer
warms
light
grapefruit
and
other
citrus
fruity
esters
a
hit
of
alcohol
and
a
bit
of
toasted
malt
quite
nice
but
not
near
as
hop
forward
as
i
expected
more
malt
and
alcohol
flavor
begins
quite
bitter
with
far
more
hop
character
than
the
aroma
betrays
hop
character
is
mostly
pine
resin
but
with
some
citrus
peel
bitterness
high
hop
bitterness
is
balanced
by
a
malt
backbone
with
caramel
and
toasted
malt
flavors
towards
the
middle
and
end
of
the
sip
there
is
a
bit
of
brown
sugar
appearing
alongside
the
other
flavors
and
some
flavors
of
alcohol
alcohol
becomes
more
prominent
as
the
beer
warms
aftertaste
is
bitter
with
some
grainy
and
toasted
flavors
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
slightly
sticky
and
semidrying
with
low
carbonation
very
easy
to
drink
maybe
a
little
light
bodied
overall
a
good
fairly
complex
strong
ale
the
hop
bitterness
is
very
high
balancing
the
sweet
malt
flavors
pretty
good
however
i
prefer
double
bastard
o
not
a
bad
brew
ive
had
it
before
a
while
ago
but
im
just
now
reviewing
it
for
my
own
keep
sake
arrogant
bastard
ale
has
a
monster
flavor
its
good
to
try
at
least
once
if
youre
looking
for
a
strong
beer
then
definitely
go
with
this
one
its
a
well
crafted
west
coast
style
ipa
overall
if
youre
a
fan
of
the
socalled
east
coast
ipa
which
experience
has
lead
me
to
believe
is
any
sort
of
ipa
that
has
enough
malts
to
balance
the
hoppiness
youre
likely
to
enjoy
this
brew
fortunately
stone
has
a
wideranging
distribution
and
most
of
the
continental
united
states
gawd
bless
amurikuh
can
enjoy
this
enjoyable
beer
apart
from
that
i
cant
fault
it
from
my
tasting
notes
with
my
first
taste
my
initial
thought
was
what
the
hell
it
had
a
very
offputting
bitterness
that
was
not
necessarily
an
intense
hoppiness
like
an
iipa
and
it
was
surprising
the
label
states
it
is
quite
doubtful
that
you
have
the
taste
of
sophistication
to
appreciate
an
ale
of
this
quality
and
depth
and
i
was
beginning
to
believe
them
i
have
to
admit
i
was
a
bit
disappointed
i
finished
the
first
glass
and
slowly
poured
the
rest
of
the
bottle
with
growing
dread
by
now
the
beer
had
begun
to
warm
a
bit
as
i
left
it
out
of
the
refrigerator
as
it
warmed
arrogant
bastard
took
on
a
much
smoother
more
balanced
taste
as
the
malts
began
to
balance
out
the
hop
bitterness
with
a
more
roasty
almost
toffee
flavor
i
easily
finished
glass
2
and
completely
erased
my
earlier
disappointment
this
is
definitely
an
aggressive
and
sophisticated
beer
as
the
label
suggests
and
a
very
good
highly
recommended
introduction
to
stone
just
let
it
warm
a
little
first
o
its
almost
aggravating
how
good
stone
is
because
i
constantly
tell
myself
that
their
brews
cant
be
all
theyre
built
up
to
be
but
im
always
wrong
and
arrogant
bastard
is
no
exception
to
that
scenario
this
one
is
every
bit
as
refined
and
complex
as
stone
states
in
their
arrogance
its
certainly
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
and
if
youve
got
the
balls
to
handle
it
its
a
musttry
overall
a
great
beer
by
a
great
brewery
i
shall
be
picking
up
more
22oz
bottles
great
beer
i
could
drink
this
more
regularly
unlike
the
db
which
i
could
only
drink
on
special
occasions
very
good
intricate
not
for
the
bubbly
yellow
fans
and
i
like
it
that
way
i
really
love
this
beer
and
it
only
gets
better
through
the
years
which
is
really
rare
these
days
o
a
great
beer
if
you
can
handle
the
hops
it
has
a
very
complex
set
of
flavors
but
you
need
to
look
past
the
bitterness
to
really
find
all
the
great
ingredients
that
went
into
making
this
awesome
beer
very
nice
ale
indeed
hot
damn
i
have
never
been
disappointed
by
stone
here
is
another
great
offering
and
it
is
perfect
for
the
cold
weather
coming
through
now
excuse
me
while
i
finish
off
the
rest
of
my
22
oz
wish
me
luck
i
love
this
beer
give
me
a
another
o
a
staple
beer
in
my
house
for
sure
i
love
the
hop
and
malt
presence
here
i
currently
have
this
on
tap
in
my
kegerator
and
it
is
a
delicious
beer
arrogant
bastard
ale
was
a
gorgeous
reddish
brown
color
it
has
a
thick
rocky
beige
colored
head
with
excellent
retention
and
lacing
the
smell
was
mainly
piney
hops
with
some
sweet
malt
the
taste
was
piney
hops
and
sweet
caramel
malt
with
balancing
bitterness
the
finish
was
long
hoppy
and
bitter
the
mouthfeel
was
good
with
a
mediumfull
body
and
medium
body
overall
this
is
a
very
good
hoppy
beer
and
should
be
tried
by
any
hoplovers
overall
a
hop
forward
standard
for
the
style
i
will
now
seek
out
double
bastard
and
oaked
draft
poured
into
a
pint
pilsner
it
has
a
18
head
which
dissolves
quickly
then
lovely
lacing
down
the
glass
medium
brown
in
color
unfiltered
aroma
is
hops
and
caramel
flavor
is
hops
malt
wellbalanced
and
very
pleasing
with
a
bit
of
pine
medium
mouth
feel
overall
an
outstanding
ale
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
it
pours
deep
brown
with
a
small
head
just
enough
to
hold
the
rim
of
the
glass
while
you
drink
it
has
a
strong
flavor
with
some
coffee
notes
it
is
heavy
and
not
for
the
timid
o
a
big
flavored
hopforward
ale
with
great
flavors
across
the
board
o
this
beer
has
both
surprised
and
spoiled
me
less
hoppy
than
an
ipa
which
i
like
as
i
tend
to
find
ipas
too
hoppy
but
still
a
strong
flavor
ive
only
had
a
few
bottles
but
its
already
one
of
my
favorites
if
im
sampling
several
different
beers
i
try
to
stick
ab
towards
the
end
as
many
beers
seem
mild
compared
to
abs
arrogance
for
lack
of
a
better
term
ill
admit
i
may
be
new
to
the
whole
beer
review
thing
but
even
i
can
tell
where
stone
was
going
with
this
i
see
now
why
they
call
it
arrogant
bastard
and
why
most
of
us
wont
enjoy
this
beer
its
because
its
nothing
special
its
an
okay
beer
nothing
more
i
usually
like
wheats
and
pilsners
with
my
food
but
this
is
an
exception
most
of
all
if
spicey
food
is
on
the
menu
this
is
a
wonderful
ale
im
sipping
it
and
the
taste
is
going
up
thru
my
nasal
passages
from
my
mouth
im
increasing
my
rating
on
it
o
a
classic
of
the
craft
origins
and
just
a
great
drinking
beer
overall
i
could
easily
make
this
an
everyday
beer
if
it
was
readily
available
o
really
nice
hoppy
strong
ale
its
not
quite
an
ipa
not
qutie
an
amber
something
in
between
really
nice
hop
flavor
and
malt
flavor
both
are
strong
and
balanced
but
sharp
at
the
same
time
ill
have
to
get
a
little
fresher
version
of
this
sometime
might
be
on
the
edge
of
starting
to
fade
hopwise
or
maybe
this
is
just
really
balanced
appearance
as
poured
into
a
20
oz
pint
glass
is
stunning
a
khaki
head
of
foam
that
does
not
fall
after
nearly
5
minutes
of
sitting
a
reddish
brown
color
with
absolute
clarity
that
appears
almost
blood
red
when
held
to
the
light
smell
is
very
potent
and
powerful
with
equal
part
resiny
herbal
hops
and
dark
malts
dried
fruit
prunes
leather
botanicals
pine
and
resin
the
taste
is
bitter
dark
and
satisfying
with
a
burnt
sugar
caramel
toast
roasted
cereal
grains
and
black
coffee
offset
by
earthy
and
resinous
hop
character
ending
astringent
and
slightly
drying
it
sits
heavily
in
the
mouth
coating
medium
carbonation
that
is
completely
fitting
this
beer
is
good
to
the
last
drop
a
combination
of
ipa
amber
ale
and
imperial
stout
in
my
opinion
its
a
classic
that
has
stood
the
test
of
time
and
one
that
i
come
back
to
over
and
over
again
o
my
only
knock
here
is
the
after
taste
its
very
very
strong
and
ruins
and
otherwise
near
perfect
beer
though
with
that
its
still
very
good
onice
to
finally
review
one
of
the
classic
craft
beers
and
a
true
american
style
icon
i
may
enjoy
other
beers
more
but
this
one
still
drinks
wonderfully
especially
with
pizza
and
for
4
per
bomber
it
may
have
to
find
a
more
regular
spot
in
my
rotation
at
the
moment
im
feeling
pretty
darned
worthy
serving
type
bottle
delicious
absolutely
delicious
o
the
arrogance
is
deserved
a
highly
bitter
fairly
complex
brew
that
certainly
would
frighten
those
used
to
mass
market
beer
im
looking
forward
to
trying
its
bastard
brethren
i
havent
had
a
beer
from
stone
brewery
that
i
didnt
like
o
solid
though
unexceptional
beer
from
stone
overall
the
flavor
of
this
beer
delivers
big
time
i
prefer
this
more
than
the
oaked
version
as
usual
stone
have
created
a
quality
brew
while
i
would
not
agree
that
this
is
a
world
class
brew
i
would
definitely
agree
that
this
is
an
outstanding
brew
the
brews
strongpoint
being
its
nice
balanced
aroma
of
fine
malts
and
an
amazing
pour
the
brew
is
very
strong
pungent
and
acidic
in
a
good
way
and
leaves
a
great
aftertaste
that
sticks
for
a
while
a
very
worthy
brew
and
as
always
many
thanks
to
stone
who
are
easily
one
of
the
better
american
breweries
overall
this
is
an
awesome
beer
put
out
by
stone
as
usual
ill
definitely
buy
this
again
o
excellent
brew
great
malt
and
hop
mix
ive
only
recently
been
introduced
to
the
stone
brewing
company
that
said
from
the
very
first
sip
i
knew
i
was
not
a
typical
brew
it
wasnt
even
a
typical
craft
brew
my
initial
response
to
a
stone
brewing
company
product
was
wow
i
think
this
might
be
the
best
beer
ive
ever
tasted
that
was
the
stone
ipa
this
is
my
first
try
of
arrogant
bastard
ale
and
after
my
taste
buds
stopped
screaming

taste
is
nice
pungent
hops
intense
compared
to
most
american
ales
an
exceptional
beer
and
one
that
did
not
disappoint
in
any
way
shape
or
form
upon
first
trying
it
the
beer
was
insanely
hoppy
with
lots
of
bitterness
surprisingly
easy
to
drink
and
went
down
well
with
the
mouthfeel
complimented
the
taste
and
smell
quite
well
a
must
try
o
a
bit
too
bitter
for
my
tastes
but
still
a
very
good
beer
overall
this
is
one
in
your
face
beer
snpa
made
me
realize
that
there
are
beers
with
a
lot
more
flavor
than
what
society
would
lead
you
to
think
this
was
the
beer
that
made
me
realize
that
beers
could
blow
the
roof
off
of
your
palate
my
palate
has
tamed
this
beast
since
then
but
i
still
find
this
to
be
a
great
beer
to
keep
on
hand
at
all
times
really
great
ale
without
having
an
abv
that
knocks
me
out
says
a
lot
these
days
when
7
2
is
mild
great
reliable
beer
from
stone
overall
this
ale
neednt
the
arrogance
it
flaunts
on
its
bottle
although
this
undeniably
adds
to
its
character
as
its
deep
hop
aromas
and
aggressive
bitterness
give
it
its
welldeserved
status
as
one
of
the
finest
examples
of
american
craft
beer
brilliance
the
bottle
claims
that
were
not
worthy
of
drinking
it
and
perhaps
its
right
any
ale
with
as
much
character
as
this
would
have
even
the
most
seasoned
beer
buff
worshipping
it
religiously
a
reasonable
buy
at
5
for
the
bomber
but
there
is
a
sort
of
rich
heaviness
to
it
that
wasnt
inviting
me
back
for
another
sip
worth
a
try
why
the
hell
not
but
fans
of
tart
cloudy
ipas
are
not
likely
to
be
back
for
a
second
helping
o
great
balance
and
very
drinkable
one
of
the
easier
drinking
strong
ales
that
i
can
remember
with
great
mouthfeel
to
boot
very
interesting
beer
would
be
great
without
the
aftertaste
welcome
to
the
major
leagues
of
american
strong
ale
overall
the
label
on
the
bottle
isnt
too
far
from
the
truth
if
you
are
more
into
lighter
beers
id
sip
or
steer
clear
of
arrogant
bastard
ale
otherwise
arrogant
bastard
ale
a
very
fullbodied
american
strong
ale
that
will
kick
you
in
the
butt
and
keep
you
coming
back
for
more
to
taste
74100
tldr
this
is
a
great
and
powerful
booze
but
be
warned
you
might
not
be
ready
decidedly
bitter
but
balanced
in
extremes
to
an
extent
a
glutton
for
punishment
the
promise
of
sweet
malt
draws
me
back
in
for
the
bitter
hop
beating
this
is
a
stong
beer
it
might
be
a
little
expensive
but
worth
it
has
a
strong
smell
and
taste
might
be
kinda
bitter
at
first
but
once
you
pallet
adjusts
you
wont
be
able
to
drink
anthing
else
for
the
rest
of
the
night
i
highly
recomend
this
beer
with
some
good
pizza
or
fryed
chicken
enjoy
o
a
great
got
to
aggressively
hopped
beer
that
drinks
like
a
fresh
americanized
version
of
an
old
ale
this
beer
could
hold
its
own
when
paired
with
a
spicy
owing
to
how
strong
the
flavors
are
or
the
bitterness
could
easily
cut
through
a
rich
fatty
dish
id
enjoy
this
with
pot
roast
of
beef
stew
myself
o
when
first
i
had
this
beer
years
ago
as
the
bottle
itself
states
i
was
not
worthy
truly
casuals
will
find
little
to
enjoy
from
this
one
as
it
certainly
isnt
for
the
uninitiated
now
im
proud
to
count
myself
among
the
highest
echelon
of
drinkers
those
who
this
beer
was
made
for
arrogance
achieved
o
i
really
like
this
beer
very
balanced
and
in
my
opinion
the
best
offering
from
stone
o
great
simple
beer
i
think
this
is
obviously
worldclass
and
its
price
is
more
than
reasonable
doesnt
get
much
better
than
this
o
a
staple
beer
everyone
should
have
at
least
one
would
have
liked
a
bit
more
from
aroma
the
fact
that
everything
is
set
on
high
but
still
balanced
is
impressive
it
pours
an
beigenecked
amber
with
a
very
well
retained
neck
beautiful
the
aroma
emanates
grassy
american
hops
but
i
also
noticed
a
background
caramelized
malt
which
makes
it
very
pleasing
too
the
taste
wellcarbonated
mediumbodied
brings
again
the
very
characteristic
american
hops
and
the
slightly
sweetish
caramelized
malt
it
is
super
refreshing
with
the
alcohol
very
fitting
to
the
other
features
of
the
beer
in
the
end
we
have
a
strong
presence
of
hops
excellent
o
probably
an
acquired
taste
i
live
in
sd
so
me
and
stone
are
bffs
that
said
while
i
think
everyone
should
try
this
beer
i
dont
expect
everyone
to
love
it
immediately
it
takes
some
time
before
the
gargoyle
gets
you
bottom
line
your
not
worthy
im
not
worthy
overall
this
is
a
nice
refresher
the
clear
brownishred
says
coke
in
the
head
and
the
tongue
says
refreshing
but
not
coke
easy
to
drink
and
i
like
the
abv
relatively
simple
taste
and
straightforward
honestly
when
i
first
tried
this
beer
i
thought
i
wasnt
worthy
it
wasnt
until
the
second
time
i
had
it
i
realized
how
truly
amazing
this
ale
actually
is
at
first
i
was
sort
of
off
put
by
the
sheer
bitterness
that
this
beer
has
but
after
overcoming
that
aspect
i
absolutely
fell
in
love
with
an
ibu
thats
said
to
be
over
100
stone
says
the
real
ibu
is
classified
it
can
be
quite
intimidating
especially
after
reading
the
blurb
on
the
back
of
the
bottle
that
said
i
am
just
blown
away
by
how
good
this
is
it
pours
a
beautiful
darkish
red
color
with
a
bone
white
head
the
pine
and
sting
of
the
hops
is
immediately
noticeable
as
you
pour
even
more
noticeable
as
you
drink
with
a
hint
of
sweetness
behind
it
along
with
malt
and
a
bit
of
roast
as
well
the
mouth
is
surprisingly
smooth
with
low
carbonation
it
almost
clings
to
your
taste
buds
leaving
you
with
a
lingering
bitterness
this
is
quite
a
special
and
unique
ale
im
glad
to
say
that
im
from
the
same
city
where
this
beast
was
conceived
i
just
bought
a
four
pack
of
the
oaked
aba
and
eagerly
await
to
try
it
review
will
follow
overall
damned
delicious
smooth
and
deep
in
complex
flavor
and
well
balanced
sticks
to
the
tongue
but
not
enough
to
be
too
sticky
overall
i
kinda
had
a
high
expectation
for
this
beer
one
thing
i
really
like
was
the
malts
in
this
beer
its
an
interesting
combination
with
the
heavy
hops
definitely
worth
a
try
a
great
beer
but
a
slightly
smoother
flavor
would
have
been
more
up
my
alley
o
this
stuff
is
a
marvel
of
modern
craft
beer
imitated
but
certainly
never
duplicated
price
point

oz
bomber
overall
a
quite
tasty
brew
its
on
the
hoppier
side
but
balanced
quite
nicely
by
the
sweeter
fruit
caramel
and
more
malty
flavors
of
the
brew
its
well
know
for
a
good
reason
its
quite
a
good
moderate
strength
ipa
o
even
if
i
hated
this
beer
i
would
give
it
points
for
the
monologue
on
the
bottle
in
fact
this
is
an
excellent
beer
that
may
become
one
of
my
gotos
poured
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
four
finger
tan
colored
head
that
lingered
for
quite
a
while
the
head
recessed
with
beautiful
mounds
leaving
a
medium
tracing
behind
had
a
light
aroma
that
gave
to
a
surprisingly
strong
hop
taste
that
left
a
medium
amount
of
bitterness
on
the
palate
mouth
feel
was
medium
with
an
almost
light
chewiness
to
it
all
together
i
found
it
to
be
a
delightful
beer
for
any
afternoon
poured
entire
bomber
into
34oz
mug
dark
slightly
cloudy
orange
with
a
thick
white
head
that
sticks
around
with
some
great
lacing
smells
flowery
and
hoppy
like
an
ipa
although
with
a
bit
thicker
malt
backbone
taste
follows
nose
exactly
sweet
thick
and
malty
at
first
and
bitter
and
hoppy
to
finish
mouthfeel
is
medium
not
too
full
or
fizzy
delicious
o
no
idea
what
to
expect
lots
of
coffee
and
bitter
chocolate
as
well
as
nice
dry
floral
hops
nice
truly
unique
beer
overall
one
of
my
favorites
ill
never
get
sick
of
this
beer
not
quite
perfect
but
about
as
close
as
you
can
get
this
beer
is
a
jerk
very
nice
beer
o
solid
ale
that
is
balanced
with
sweet
and
bitter
flavors
the
balance
on
this
beer
allows
it
to
be
big
and
bold
yet
still
quite
drinkable
an
amazing
ale

great
beer
samuel
smiths
old
brewery
pale
ale
has
long
been
my
favorite
ale
arrogant
bastard
may
have
surpassed
it
cant
say
that
just
yet
but
i
can
say
as
long
as
stone
bc
keeps
making
this
ill
keep
buying
and
drinking
bravo
overall
its
a
great
beer
the
notorious
beer
that
invented
the
american
strong
ale
category
and
also
introduced
a
whole
lot
of
people
to
the
true
art
of
craft
beer
while
this
certainly
isnt
the
best
american
strong
ale
ive
had
stones
lucky
bastard
takes
that
honer
which
is
actually
a
blend
of
all
3
arrogant
bastard
variants
this
is
a
landmark
beer
that
can
be
enjoy
both
by
the
craft
beer
neophyte
and
the
most
seasoned
craft
beer
enthusiast
highly
recommend
i
am
not
the
biggest
ale
fan
until
now
this
ale
is
a
wonderful
blend
of
hoppy
bitter
and
full
body
greatness
with
a
slight
trace
of
an
exotic
spice
from
some
small
tribal
community
in
southern
iran
that
ive
never
heard
of
at
first
the
inexperienced
drinker
may
find
this
beer
a
bit
vulgar
cocky
and
downright
mean
but
as
the
offensive
posturing
of
this
beer
starts
to
mellow
down
and
slides
smoothly
down
your
throat
you
will
find
yourself
begging
for
yet
another
fake
beating
by
the
fourth
gulp
you
will
be
writing
love
notes
overall
one
of
the
the
best
beers
i
have
ever
had
and
ive
drank
quite
a
bit
of
beer
in
my
day
warm
or
cold
this
beer
is
outstanding
i
was
taken
aback
by
the
beer
that
poured
like
a
brown
or
amber
ale
smelled
like
an
ipa
and
tasted
like
well
nothing
ive
ever
really
had
it
is
a
true
conglomeration
of
styles
a
hybrid
of
styles
done
absolutely
correctly
if
you
havent
had
this
brew
you
need
to
get
it
pours
reddish
with
soft
head
aroma
is
bready
biscuits
caramel
assertive
pine
hops
taste
has
nice
caramel
and
booze
flavor
with
a
pine
bitter
crisp
finish
to
balance
things
out
a
complex
and
strong
beer
dry
and
assertive
medium
slick
palate
medium
carbonation
very
nice
o
frequently
enjoyed
given
availability
it
ruins
the
palate
a
bit
but
when
im
in
the
mood
for
a
bitter
bomb
this
is
an
old
standby
this
is
a
fun
one
ab
introduced
me
to
the
craft
beer
world
i
knew
little
about
it
all
the
color
is
a
gorgeous
amber
brown
the
smell
is
of
nothing
but
earthy
hops
and
booze
the
taste
follows
the
nose
super
bitter
upon
a
canvas
of
earthy
notes
that
are
centered
in
this
american
strong
ale
it
is
a
decent
jumpoff
point
and
is
always
fun
to
revisit
but
the
arrogant
bastard
is
nothing
more
than
a
welllabeled
overmarketed
beer
beast
i
guess
im
not
worthy
this
is
by
far
one
of
my
favorite
all
time
beers
the
strength
and
fortitude
of
the
hoppy
full
flavor
makes
this
a
perfect
beer
its
no
wonder
that
multiple
variations
have
been
and
are
attempted
based
on
this
beer
pretty
much
all
of
those
are
excellent
too
you
cant
go
wrong
with
stone
overall
i
highly
recomend
this
beer
to
everyone
if
you
like
dark
beer
or
not
its
worth
trying
it
out
o
thank
god
that
the
store
i
bought
this
at
has
a
couple
other
stone
beers
this
was
definitely
a
trial
by
fire
beer
and
i
believe
i
passed
the
test
a
great
purchase
excellent
beer
you
have
to
have
a
taste
for
a
stronger
tasting
beer
to
enjoy
this
one
poured
a
darker
brown
color
taste
is
hoppy
barley
like
not
bad
at
all
and
will
get
again
i
personally
like
a
hoppy
taste
i
would
say
that
it
is
just
under
the
taste
of
an
ipa
it
also
had
about
an
index
finger
width
worth
of
head
on
it
that
was
tannish
in
color
the
taste
was
a
big
shock
to
me
as
it
wasnt
nearly
as
hoppy
and
bitter
as
it
smelled
it
does
have
the
grapefruit
hoppy
taste
of
a
pale
ale
but
its
not
overpowering
which
is
what
i
was
afraid
of
honestly
im
a
stout
man
and
i
bought
and
drank
this
as
a
promise
to
a
friend
i
am
truly
glad
that
i
did
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
and
i
will
definately
be
buying
more
of
it
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
bottled
beers
considering
some
of
its
qualifying
competitors
come
from
the
same
company
you
cant
go
too
wrong
with
any
stone
beer
delightful
mouth
feel
superb
flavor
and
tremendous
overall
quality
a
bit
pricey
but
worth
the
splurge
try
it
it
might
become
your
favorite
beer
if
you
like
something
a
bit
hoppier
try
the
ipas
from
stone
seriously
a
brewery
we
can
only
hope
is
around
to
stay
pours
brown
with
some
reddish
hues
when
held
to
a
light
great
frothy
beige
head
holds
good
retention
leaves
excellent
lacing
all
over
the
glass
as
the
head
dissipates
nose
is
fresh
piny
hops
grapefruit
sweet
caramel
malt
bready
pungent
tastes
are
definitely
bold
with
pungent
piny
grapefruity
hops
bitter
upfront
sweetness
comes
through
as
bready
malt
and
heavy
caramel
almost
burnt
slight
earthiness
but
the
pine
rides
out
the
finish
and
lingers
medium
body
creamy
nice
carbonation
overall
always
a
favorite
of
mine
nice
to
come
back
to
after
waiting
too
long
to
pick
one
up
overall
in
short
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
complex
intense
mildly
overwhelming
with
a
sharp
bite
however
extremely
enjoyable
wellcrafted
aromatic
fullbodied
delicious
probably
not
for
a
novice
and
definitely
not
for
a
bmc
drinker
but
definitely
recommend
this
to
those
that
appreciate
such
a
well
brewed
beer
wow
overall
good
pretty
aggressive
flavour
quite
bold
stone
delivers
yet
again
overall
what
can
i
say
perhaps
that
perspective
is
a
good
thing
as
one
who
came
of
age
in
the
50s60s
and
eagerly
sampled
the
readily
available
us
beers
of
that
period
this
beer
makes
me
very
happy
those
who
have
come
of
age
since
the
1980s
cannot
fully
appreciate
the
dramatic
difference
between
the
readily
available
beers
i
naively
quaffed
in
my
20s
and
30s
and
what
is
available
today
and
breweries
like
stone
are
the
leaders
in
providing
such
a
drastic
difference
between
then
and
now
they
are
paving
the
future
of
beer
by
expanding
the
envelope
beyond
what
we
so
eagerly
enjoy
today
overall
one
of
my
favorite
beers
out
there
and
a
true
product
of
the
fine
men
at
stone
pours
a
dark
brown
ruby
with
a
finger
of
caramel
tinged
foam
moderate
carbonation
with
good
lacing
and
retention
aroma
of
hops
caramel
some
citrus
toffee
a
bit
of
alcohol
and
some
sugar
with
a
good
sweet
malty
back
taste
of
spicy
hop
caramel
malts
and
some
butterscotch
sweet
malts
come
through
with
a
strong
finish
tying
the
beer
together
mouth
is
full
bodied
good
carbonation
with
a
nice
sticky
finish
overall
a
great
beer
worthy
of
the
hype
and
arrogance
overy
well
balanced
beer
sweet
and
hoppy
brew
flavor
text
is
hilarious
and
a
good
read
taste
is
well
balanced
to
me
both
the
hops
and
the
malt
both
come
out
equal
to
me
very
full
bodied
beer
carbonation
is
just
right
not
one
flavor
really
over
powers
another
a
great
well
balanced
ale
that
i
will
be
purchasing
more
of
stone
arrogant
bastard
ale
45
o
allinall
a
very
flavorful
beer
that
complimented
my
meal
at
this
fine
establishment
i
enjoyed
meeting
and
talking
with
steve
the
veryknowledgeable
owner
however
if
you
want
balance
to
your
beer
and
greater
character
from
the
malt
look
elsewhere
arrogantly
overhopped
and
flavored
this
beer
packs
a
ton
of
flavor
at
only
7
2
abv
very
good
ps
ignore
the
4
for
the
overall
i
am
only
giving
it
that
to
balance
it
out
to
the
score
that
i
think
this
beer
deserves
a
4
63
is
utterly
appropriate
and
i
think
i
gave
each
of
the
categories
an
accurate
score
but
with
the
overall
being
4
5
the
score
for
the
beer
was
somewhat
too
high
so
i
lowered
the
overall
if
you
enjoy
ipas
this
brown
ale
may
beat
a
few
you
have
had
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
hops
so
it
was
all
i
could
do
to
hold
my
nose
and
choke
down
this
beer
i
paid
7
dollars
for
but
if
you
are
a
fan
of
bitter
tasting
hop
flavored
beers
give
this
a
go
this
just
happens
to
be
on
the
opposite
spectrum
of
my
liking
overall
4
0
excellent
tasting
beer
and
thats
all
that
matters
to
me
if
i
ever
find
this
on
tap
i
will
not
hesitate
to
order
a
pint
this
beer
has
a
really
unique
flavor
profile
and
i
will
definitely
be
buying
this
brew
again
wonderfully
sessionable
in
spite
of
its
7
2
overall
great
beer
this
one
definatly
lived
up
to
its
reputation
i
will
have
this
one
again
o
a
great
beer
for
seasoned
craft
drinkers
heavily
recommended
to
hop
heads
who
want
more
than
another
ipa
all
around
flavorful
and
satisfying
beer
i
personally
feel
that
stone
has
better
beers
out
there
but
this
one
has
plenty
of
merit
and
stands
above
most
beers
as
a
truly
strong
ale
o
an
excellent
beer
all
the
complexities
i
would
expect
from
stone
the
beer
opens
up
more
and
more
as
it
warms
like
a
story
begging
to
be
told
very
wellbalanced
overall
this
beer
is
a
solid
ale
7
2
abv
is
masked
well
by
the
sweetness
of
the
brew
but
you
can
still
taste
the
alcohol
in
the
beer
worth
a
try
even
though
some
reviewers
find
the
beer
difficult
to
finish
mouthfeel
this
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
that
is
rather
easy
drinking
compared
to
some
but
like
the
label
says
not
for
the
yellow
swill
drinking
wimps
taste
like
asprin
effin
hate
it
so
much
yuck
i
had
that
taste
on
the
tip
of
my
tounge
that
was
numbing
i
thought
it
would
be
awesome
without
that
nasty
taste
its
however
smooth
if
they
change
that
taste
i
would
engage
another
drink
its
not
horrible
but
maybe
you
should
buy
1
22oz
and
try
it
out
who
knows
you
might
like
it
it
also
was
like
4
dollars
at
a
store
in
portland
oregon
excellent
brew
reminds
you
of
red
and
strong
ales
until
it
goes
in
and
once
it
enters
the
mouth
it
gives
more
of
a
mild
ipa
feel
do
your
duty
to
god
and
your
country
fight
hard
stay
strong
be
true
be
just
but
always
be
a
bastard
im
sure
most
people
will
disagree
with
me
but
i
had
to
pour
out
most
of
this
pint
the
head
hadnt
even
dissipated
before
my
stomach
started
to
hurt
im
not
sure
if
my
stomach
just
didnt
like
one
of
the
ingredients
or
if
the
hops
were
just
too
strong
for
my
stomach
all
i
know
is
i
couldnt
finish
it
drink
it
with
love
and
rocketss
american
dream
be
patient
o
this
is
a
terrific
beer
i
really
enjoyed
it
im
not
really
a
fan
of
over
hopping
but
this
was
still
extremely
good
has
a
nice
balance
of
sweet
and
bitter
this
is
an
excellent
example
of
the
american
strong
ale
and
borders
on
an
ipa
in
my
opinion
complex
tasty
and
balanced
must
try
this
was
one
of
the
first
six
beers
i
purchased
when
i
turned
21
i
liked
it
then
i
like
it
now
stone
has
always
been
there
for
me
and
im
glad
they
helped
me
on
my
path
twowheels
for
life
maybe
im
the
only
one
o
the
arrogant
bastard
of
the
stone
brewery
line
really
does
everything
from
sweet
complex
malt
to
aggressive
hopping
one
of
the
stone
brews
that
really
showcases
both
strength
and
depth
of
flavor
it
has
been
to
long
since
my
last
go
at
the
classic
bastard
this
beer
is
a
deep
amber
color
and
is
extremely
hazy
the
head
is
slightly
off
white
and
really
doesnt
stick
around
too
long
the
nose
is
mostly
pine
herbal
and
floral
hops
the
taste
of
this
beer
starts
out
with
a
high
bitterness
and
an
intense
hop
profile
there
is
a
ton
of
grassy
herbal
spicy
notes
and
a
lot
of
pine
and
some
lemon
zest
the
beer
has
a
ton
of
mouth
feel
and
helps
to
deliver
the
beers
flavors
the
other
flavors
of
the
beer
are
toffee
caramel
and
bread
yeast
this
is
a
classic
go
to
beer
best
fresh
in
my
opinion
smells
of
piney
citrus
hopping
combined
with
toasted
caramel
malts
in
aggressive
quantities
gains
a
touch
of
cherry
aroma
as
it
warms
up
flavor
follows
suit
but
also
has
a
woody
and
brash
herbal
hopping
aspect
that
creeps
up
on
you
it
is
slightly
out
of
balance
in
favor
of
the
hops
on
purpose
but
thats
sort
of
the
target
they
were
aiming
for
for
me
this
feels
like
a
nice
return
to
aggressive
beers
that
comforts
me
whenever
im
in
the
mood
for
something
aggressive
yet
not
completely
over
the
top
crazy
this
beer
contains
a
solid
amount
of
malt
flavor
as
well
as
hop
flavor
and
does
an
incredibly
nice
job
of
balancing
the
two
in
near
perfect
harmony
one
of
the
hardest
tasks
when
making
beer
this
is
a
beer
that
i
have
had
many
times
and
im
sure
many
more
times
to
come
final
thoughts
stone
never
disappoints
me
the
reputation
of
arrogant
bastard
and
their
whole
line
up
is
well
deserved
a
great
beer
that
separates
the
men
from
the
boys
well
the
macro
drinkers
from
the
craft
beer
consumers
at
least
would
i
drink
it
again
yes
o
im
not
sure
how
many
more
times
ill
get
this
one
but
it
was
certainly
a
good
offering
id
love
to
try
it
on
tap
there
is
nothing
quite
like
arrogant
bastard
i
love
that
descriptors
for
the
beer
ended
with
you
probably
wont
like
it
this
might
be
true
though
for
the
uninitiated
its
quite
a
bitch
slap
on
your
tongue
strong
ale
is
the
best
way
to
describe
it
its
just
so
strong
on
your
tongue
bitter
and
complex
i
honestly
cant
pick
apart
the
pieces
that
make
up
this
beer
the
malt
and
hops
work
together
seemlessly
for
a
balanced
taste
ive
never
tasted
sweetness
in
this
beer
though
which
some
have
noted
in
their
reviews
as
it
warms
it
is
a
little
smoother
but
sweet
is
an
adjective
i
reserve
for
the
double
bastard
ill
be
looking
for
this
one
again
absolute
must
try
o
a
decent
strong
ale
more
akin
to
an
old
ale
than
anything
but
drier
than
i
look
for
i
wish
it
had
a
touch
more
sweetness
to
its
fruit
esters
and
caramel
flavors
it
just
seems
to
be
a
little
offbalance
somehow
o
not
groundbreaking
all
the
marketing
youre
not
worthy
aside
its
somewhat
of
a
staple
to
the
craft
beer
world
kind
of
a
stepping
stone
past
snpa
and
boston
lager
its
a
damn
tasty
hopped
up
beer
with
a
great
malt
backbone
and
it
doesnt
have
to
be
super
fresh
to
be
enjoyed
either
ive
always
been
a
fan
of
this
beer
and
will
continue
to
pick
up
a
bomber
from
time
to
time
ive
had
this
beer
quite
a
few
times
mostly
because
i
like
it
so
much
as
i
pour
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
it
develops
an
average
inch
head
the
appearance
is
beautiful
of
that
of
a
dark
cherry
color
the
smell
also
has
hints
of
cherry
with
woodsy
notes
as
well
the
taste
of
the
beer
also
has
woodsy
and
cherry
notes
i
especialy
love
the
lingering
aftertaste
and
feeling
this
beer
leaves
on
the
palate
overall
i
love
this
beer
id
recommend
it
to
everyone
oone
of
the
best
named
beers
in
the
world
lives
up
to
its
hype
time
and
time

out

i
had
arrogant
bastard
about
2
years
ago
for
the
first
time
the
thing
that
originally
caught
my
eye
was
the
name
ever
since
the
first
time
i
had
the
arrogant
bastard
my
nickname
became
the
arrogant
bastard
everywhere
my
friends
and
i
may
go
if
there
is
arrogant
bastard
available
it
is
the
beer
i
will
purchase
the
jesus
of
beers
o
kind
of
a
classic
ale
the
way
it
smells
and
tastes
but
the
appearance
blew
me
away
the
most
great
cherry
red
color
seen
this
one
a
lot
and
finally
tried
it
and
liked
it
very
much
this
beer
has
a
very
aggressive
taste
as
i
said
this
is
a
mans
beer
very
hoppy
and
full
of
flavor
a
nice
mix
of
fruits
spice
and
outdoorsy
flavor
this
would
make
a
great
tailgate
beer
in
this
fall
try
this
beer
ad
you
wont
be
dissapointed
another
hit
from
stone
i
suppose
this
is
the
beer
that
got
my
into
good
beer
it
was
described
as
my
favorite
for
a
long
time
rudy
reddish
brown
with
a
coffee
ice
cream
colored
head
light
tan
i
suppose
plenty
of
lacing
large
aromas
of
grapefruit
piney
resinous
and
a
hint
of
cacao
packed
with
hoppy
goodness
but
balanced
by
a
big
ol
malt
bill
flavor
follows
nose
closely
grapefruit
sticky
tree
sap
resin
clean
yeast
flavor
a
bit
of

the
hops
are
well
rounded
out
by
the
size
of
this
beer
not
a
complex
beer
pretty
full
bodied
and
thick
beer
an
iconic
beer
pours
brown
with
an
orange
hue
there
is
a
finger
of
head
that
enjoys
some
retention
and
leaves
a
nice
layer
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
nose
is
distinctly
piney
the
upfront
flavors
are
malt
and
bread
and
there
is
a
terrific
hop
bite
on
the
finish
there
is
a
touch
of
alcohol
present
but
nothing
unpleasant
this
beer
is
simple
hearty
goodness
on
a
cold
tap
in
a
chilled
glass
so
not
ideal
for
flavor
profiling
but
still
this
beer
rocks
from
just
the
looks
of
it
this
beer
is
the
standard
to
measure
others
by
dark
amber
with
a
hint
of
ruby
full
ivory
head
and
excellent
lacing
smells
of
caramel
and
other
darker
malts
ample
hops
are
present
but
are
extremely
well
balanced
by
the
malt
not
too
strong
yet
not
soft
near
perfection
in
the
last
couple
of
years
my
respect
for
stone
has
remained
at
a
very
high
level
yet
my
interest
in
this
particular
icon
of
a
beer
has
dropped
its
just
too
earthy
with
a
uniquely
dry
yet
oddly
medicinal
lingering
bitterness

the

this

seem
just
like
a
scotch
ale
keeps
all
of
the
mentioned
flavors
but
adds
a
massive
punch
of
smokeyness
to
the
finish
overall
this
is
a
big
flavorful
beer
and
as
the
lable
states
it
is
not
for
snivling
yellow
beer
drinking
wimps
though
it
didnt
appeal
to
my
particular
taste
i
was
honestly
very
surprised
how
much
i
liked
this
beer
ive
heard
many
things
about
it
and
so
i
was
hesitant
if
id
like
it
or
not
but
it
really
was
good
the
color
was
a
dark
brown
almost
orangy
the
aroma
had
nice
fruity
and
piney
notes
more
citrus
than
anything
else
the
taste
was
what
really
made
it
unique
though
it
had
the
strong
hop
character
similar
to
the
aroma
but
was
backed
up
perfecty
by
strong
malts
this
was
a
big
beer
big
hops
big
malts
big
alcohol
and
it
all
balanced
each
other
out
and
worked
very
well
overall
this
beer
was
enoyable
to
sip
while
driving
down
slice
after
slice
of
my
favorite
pizza
after
my
pizza
was
gone
i
had
a
difficult
time
finishing
the
beer
the
beer
completely
warps
your
sense
of
what
beer
can
be
perhaps
the
label
is
correct
im
not
worthy
the
thick
head
and
carbonation
also
serve
as
a
nice
buffer
enjoy
with
care
you
can
never
just
have
one
great
clear
copper
brown
color
with
very
ample
head

agresive

of
the
glass
not
getting
a
huge

this
is
a
pretty
decent
beer
that
is
not
difficult
to
find
given
the
2k
plus
reviews
there
is
not
much
more
one
can
say
about
this
beer
its
drinkable
flavorful
and
an
absolute
ground
breaker
craft
beer
owes
a
lot
to
this
brew
and
for
us
ad
guy
types
hardly
any
one
does
that
side
of
the
equation
better
all
beer
lovers
should
doff
their
caps
o
this
completes
my
bastard
circuit
all
three
of
the
stone
bastard
ales
are
great
beers
and
this
one
is
the
core
of
the
line
a
harmony
of
malts
and
hops
tons
of
flavor
and
character
beer
is
medium
to
mediumheavy
bodied
with
midlevel
carbonation
that
is
able
to
create
a
somewhat
foamy
smooth
mouthfeel
closes
out
expectedly
dry
overall
a
nice
sipper
for
sure
im
not
really
familiar
with
the
style
so
this
didnt
strike
any
emotion
in
me
if
i
were
drinking
this
on
my
deck
in
65
degree

weather
i
might
rejoice

find
that
the
common
denominator
of
many
socal
brews
is
very
mineralesque
and
super
bitter
but
lacking
in
the
citrusy
sweet
norcal
hop
department
arrogant
bastard
was
definitely
one
of
the
first
brews
that
got
me
into
craft
brews
and
i
think
it
was
more
striking
more
intense
the
first
time
i
had
it
a
long
time
ago
its
definitely
an
interesting
beer
and
definitely
worth
a
try
for
anyone
who
appreciates
the
aggressive
nature
of
the
california
strong
ale
caipaftw
a
decent
amount
of
carbonation
helps
bring
all
the
flavors
to
the
foreground
and
the
mediumheavy
body
gives
this
beer
an
almost
iipatype
of
experience
to
the
drinker
overall
this
is
an
excellent
beer
and
an
excellent
value
i
couldnt
see
myself
going
to
this
often
but
i
can
see
myself
choosing
this
beer
time
and
time
again
great
stuff
o
an
amazing
beer
simply
put
so
much
going
on
here
it
tastes
like
an
imperial
red
but
isnt
feels
slick
and
sweet
and
that
sweetness
lingers
for
a
while
drinks
well
for
the
abv
even
considering
the
full
body
i
think
stone
is
one
of
the
finest
breweries
to
come
out
of
america
period
all
their
ipa
servings
are
the
beers
to
be
judged
against
and
their
belgiumipa
is
the
tops
they
have
two
beers
that
i
cant
figure
out
if
people
are
on
something
when
they
drink
them
because
they
are
justargghh
cough
gag
cough
disgust
sickening
and
i
think
they
must
be
a
joke
from
the
brewmaster
this
is
a
wast
of
money
and
disgusting
horrid
i
would
drink
a
bud
light
any
day
over
this
bomber
poured
in
a
shaker
pours
a
deep
dark
amber
color
with
some
definite
rubyred
shining
through
small
bubbles
race
up
to
a
large
frothy
head
of
about
3cm
of
beige
the
head
lingers
and
leaves
thick
lacing
on
the
glass
a
thin
film
of
head
remains
throughout
and
leaves
a
ring
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
i
love
the
nose
of
this
beer
the
hops
are
by
far
the
dominant
force
with
bright
citrusy
smells
of
grapefruit
and
maybe
a
touch
of
orange
along
with
resiny
pine
there
right
behind
it
is
a
backbone
of
caramel
malt
very
sweet
and
definitely
very
present
i
loved
taking
deep
wafts
of
this
one
the
taste
was
hops
forward
more
citrus
and
pine
note
like
on
the
nose
and
blooming
on
your
palate
as
the
hops
develop
there
is
a
good
balance
with
the
sweet
malts
that
keep
the
hops
ever
so
slightly
in
check
the
mouthfeel
is
almost
creamy
but
not
quite
maybe
a
touch
oily
with
a
long
bitter
finish
overall
i
have
had
this
beer
along
with
many
others
before
i
found
this
site
so
i
waited
till
i
got
it
again
to
give
it
justice
i
think
i
had
it
before
i
had
really
developed
my
palate
because
i
had
not
remembered
this
one
as
good
as
i
found
it
today
i
think
it
is
another
example
of
a
beer
that
makes
use
of
very
aggressive
hops
with
good
balance
with
the
malt
very
tasty
and
i
will
buy
it
everytime
i
see
it
drinkability
not
the
best
drinking
beer
it
tastes
like
it
has
more
than
7
2
abv
too
much
bitterness
and
not
much
of
anything
else
overall
its
a
world
class
brew
that
is
available
readily
and
for
a
great
price
this
is
one
that
i
go
back
to
again
and
again
and
am
never
disappointed
a
beer
that
truly
deserves
its
high
marks
and
esteem
o
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
in
this
beer
but
it
is
not
an
easy
beer
to
drink
the
hoppy
bitterness
is
kind
of
too
intense
for
my
palate
it
is
an
enjoyable
but
more
of
a
slow
sipper
not
the
greatest
match
with
food
in
my
opinion
as
the
flavor
is
too
dominant
o
drinks
much
like
an
imperial
ipa
but
with
less
residual
bitterness
although
ive
had
ab
on
multiple
occasions
this
is
my
first
review
and
forget
how
much
i
enjoy
it
although
familiar
with
its
big
brother
double
bastard
i
really
need
to
check
out
the
oak
aged
version
of
this
stellar
brew
for
a
flagship
this
is
as
much
unique
as
it
is
enjoyable
go
out
and
get
some
for
yourself
and
be
sure
to
get
it
fresh
originally
reviewed

o
overall
this
is
a
superb
strong
ale
and
the
standard
for
the
style
extremely
balanced
and
fantastic
flavor
if
you
havent
had
one
go
now
although
im
a
fan
of
many
stone
beers
this
one
doesnt
really
stand
out
to
me
however
it
does
look
nice
its
got
a
clear
rusty
red
colour
that
i
cant
recall
seeing
before
the
downside
is
that
the
head
isnt
very
creamy
and
disappears
pretty
fast
you
can
really
notice
the
hops
in
the
smell
which
i
wasnt
expecting
on
second
smell
you
really
notice
the
malt
too
good
balance
which
of
course
transfers
very
well
to
the
taste
sweet
malty
flavour
up
front
that
finishes
moderately
bitter
with
some
anise
and
grapefruit
its
quite
dry
overall
nothing
amazing
but
it
is
a
good
beer
no
doubt
this
is
my
type
of
beer
exactly
what
youd
expect
from
a
great
brewery
such
as
stone
co
it
pours
a
dark
red
with
a
nice
thick
head
definitely
a
strong
ale
because
the
first
thing
i
picked
up
on
was
malt
followed
by
a
great
deal
of
hops
the
taste
was
great
very
hoppy
with
a
malt
aftertaste
that
is
by
no
means
too
overpowering
a
great
balance
in
flavor
the
carbonation
was
just
right
ive
had
some
good
strong
ales
but
this
is
definitely
up
there
on
my
list
910
the
hop
notes
are
basically
gone
it
presents
itself
as
a
malty
beer
with
the
ghost
of
a
piney
hop
note
that
reads
more
like
the
residue
of
fireworks
after
the
fact
you
know
they
were
there
from
the
lingering
notes
but
you
know
you
missed
them
i
will
definitely
try
this
again
and
revise
my
rating
when
i
get
a
fresher
one
overall
when
i
first
tasted
this
ale
i
said
wow
though
ive
tasted
many
ales
and
even
several
with
the
same
characteristics
described
above
there
was
something
about
this
particular
one
that
stood
out
from
the
crowd
in
a
positive
way
from
the
first
sip
my
general
impression
of
this
beer
is
just
about
how
well
balanced
it
is
good
job
stone
as
much
as
i
love
this
beer
im
afraid
of
what
will
become
of
me
if
it
distributed
here
i
may
just
become
an
arrogant
bastard
myself
o
this
is
just
a
worldclass
ale
complex
balanced
super
smooth
a
must
try
for
anyone
i
am
still
in
love
with
this
beer
and
it
continues
to
be
a
true
classic
of
all
times
superb
overall
drinkability
a
very
dangerous
beer
i
could
easily
see
myself
having
another
one
and
regretting
it
later
on
the
other
hand
while
strong
in
flavor
balanced
enough
that
you
can
get
all
the
flavors
in
each
sip
and
deeper
drink
as
well
such
that
you
want
to
come
back
for
more
ive
had
the
oaked
version
of
this
beer
in
bottle
but
on
tap
and
unoaked
i
think
its
an
even
better
beer
although
the
smell
wasnt
as
strong
as
i
though
it
would
be
still
a
great
beer
i
will
seek
out
again
fantastic
a
definitive
us
beer
the
flavour
is
perfect
with
superb
balance
between
the
malt
and
the
bitteraromatic
hops
the
body
is
also
solid
the
only
letdown
is
the
aroma
which
is
less
suggestive
than
you
might
expect
if
only
i
could
get
this
regularly
for
a
reasonable
price
a
true
classic
put
this
on
your
list
of

great
strong
ale
lots
of
malt
and
hoppyness
poured
into
a
brandy
snifter
pours
deep
caramel
brown
with
a
large
soapy
light
tan
head
the
head
retains
well
dissipating
slowly
to
leave
some
lacing
on
the
side
of
the
glass
there
are
aromas
of
big
malts
and
resinous
hops
it
has
an
earthy
smell
theres
a
nice
big
caramel
malt
backbone
in
the
taste
that
brings
some
mild
sweetness
and
breadiness
to
the
table
there
are
some
nice
piney
malts
that
balance
the
malt
flavors
its
a
well
balanced
flavor
with
a
hoppy
aftertaste
the
alcohol
is
not
detectable
in
the
taste
the
body
is
medium
to
full
with
adequate
carbonation
the
beer
is
smooth
and
the
drinkability
is
very
high
overall
this
is
an
excellent
beer
and
worth
all
the
praise
it
gets
it
is
an
excellent
accompaniment
for
a
meal
that
also
has
big
flavors
or
if
youre
looking
for
a
beer
to
have
with
a
steak
dinner
never
had
an
american
strong
ale
to
compare
it
with
but
its
a
pretty
regular
beer
for
me
i
enjoy
it
a
lot
good
beer
for
a
hop
head
i
plan
on
purchasing
this
beer
again
and
trying
the
other
kinds
as
well
and
reviewing
them
also
but
so
far
the
brewers
are
doing
a
really
great
job
with
this
ale
and
i
wish
they
keep
up
with
the
dedication
they
put
into
it
o
definitely
a
solid
brew
always
enjoy
it

the
head
barely
recedes
at
all
and
the
lacing
is
like
a
sponge
coat
of
paint
the
aroma
is
of
pine
citrus
and
earthy
notes
the
taste
is
dominated
by
intense
bitterness
both
upfront

and
the
back
this
is
not
a
session
beer
there
is
significant
malt
character
but
the
hops
do
not
give
other
flavors
a
chance
the
mouthfeel
is
rich
the
head
is
creamy
almost
like
froth
on
a
latte
this
is
an
enjoyable
beer
perhaps
not
to
be
enjoyed
daily
i
can
understand
why
the
brewers
were
so
hesitant
for
people
to
only
correlate
this
beer
with

the
name
and
story
on
the
bottle
should
be
enough
if
you
cant
handle
it
dont
drink
it
and
dont
review
it
if
youre
a
pilsner
drinker
this
beer
is
not
going
to
impress
if
youre
a
big
beer
drinker
who
enjoys
lingering
hops
and
all
the
flavors
that
big
beers
should
have
then
step
right
up
this
beer
is
stones
stellar
offering
and
one
that
i
will
also
choose
unless
i
need

basically
concur
with

that

been

in

this
is
a

favorites
certainly
deserves

but
the
particular
flavor
profile
here
rubs
me
the
wrong
way
and
i
dont
doubt
that
i
will
be
buying
more
of
this
in
the
future
in
hopes
that
i
can
get
to
know
this
arrogant
bastard
a
little
better
maybe
we
could
even

very
good
year
around
offering
from
stone
this
beer
fulfills
your
craving
for
hops
and
malts
in
a
single
beer
this
beer
would
be
a
staple
in
my
fridge
if
stone
would
only
distribute
to

maybe
someday

i

if

dark

this

has

of

5overall
i
tried
this
initially
before
joining
ba
o
big
flavor
lots
of
balance
and
a
heavy
hit
of
alcohol
this
beer
is
definitely
a
classic
for
a
reason
i
wouldnt
try
to
drink
anything
afterwards
because
it
leaves
your
mouth
feeling
totally
ravished
but
its
worth
it
dont
want
an
over
the
top
ipa
dont
want
a
malt
heavy
beer
how
about
a
perfect
combination
of
both
from
the
color
to
the
smell
to
the
taste
this
is
an
awesome
beer
nice
mixture
of
hops
with
a
sweet
malty
taste
ending
this
is
a
near
perfect
fall
beer
hot
damn
i
love
this
old
craft
standby
o
excellent
job
guys
first
stone
brewing
in
a
while
and
i
should
totally
get
on
that
again
o
this
is
a
solid
beer
that
benefits
from
its
availability
other
stone
beers
are
better
in
my
opinion
but
this
is
a
staple
that
should
be
tried
this
pours
a
dark
hazy
brown
and
has
a
good
amount
of
offwhite
head
and
sticky
lacing
the
smell
is
dark
fruit
and
a
little
spice
the
flavor
is
heavy
bitterness
and
darkfruitsi
guess
i
feel
like
the
flavor
should
be
sweeter
or
something
i
just
taste
a
lot
of
extreme
bitterness
black
walnut
comes
to
mind
im
not
complaining
however
i
dont
even
love
highly
sweet
beers
this
beer
is
definitely
tasty
but
i
would
like
to
revisit
it
in
a
food
pairing
situation
additionally
i
think
this
beer
would
be
best
served
in
the
fall
or
winter
at
a
3
59
price
point
i
see
myself
coming
back
to
this
in
those
situations
when
you
want
something
a
little
meatier
than
an
ipa
mouthfeel
plenty
of
bite
that
follows
suit
with
the
rest
of
the
beers
aggressive
nature
mouthfeel
a
nice
tingle
of
alcohol
bite
carbonated
and
dry
with
the
finish
which
quenches
the
thirst
and
make
you
want
more
a
staple
in
my
cellar
and
never
disappointed
when
i
break
into
a
bottle
o
an
excellent
beer
that
is
worthy
of
the
name
o
a
delicious
brew
not
something
id
drink
every
day
but
im
really
enjoying
it
right
now
im
sure
by
the
time
this
bomber
is
dont
my
arrogant
cravings
will
be
satisfied
o
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
had
yet
doesnt
really
get
any
better
i
love
this
stuff
i
wish
it
was
available
in
12
packs
for
7
99
like
natural
ice
is
i
remember
when
this
was
one
of
the
only
craft
beers
i
could
easily
find
glad
those
days
are
over
but
this
is
still
one
solid
brew
theres
a
saying
that
asks
which
is
better
the
devil
you
know
or
the
devil
you
dont
know
get
to
know
this
devil
id
drink
this
again
for
sure
but
perhaps
not
ice
cold
like
this
was
served
too
me
i
hope
stone
comes
to
alberta
and
seeing
how
its
in
bc
already
i
dont
think
its
much
of
a
stretch
this
is
a
classic
and
i
was
surprised
to
have
not
reviewed
before
this
is
a
fantastic
brew
o
very
balanced
and
drinkable
excellent
beer
for
the
price
i
still
prefer
the
oaked
version
though
deep
bronze
color
and
massive
head
fabulous
retention
and
lacing
looks
and
behaves
like
a
beer
from
an
old
cartoon
the
nose
is
comprised
of
citrus
pine
and
oak
with
a
floral
hops
it
is
a
little
boozey
but
it
adds
to
the
character
the
flavor
is
hops
and
malt
with
a
toffee
sweetness
bitter
bite
at
the
finish
medium
body
and
carbonation
well
crafted
one
of
the
better
ales
ive
had
really
interesting
and
flavorful
o
this
beer
is
special
to
me
so
i
probably
inflated
the
scores
a
bit
i
still
feel
even
after
everything
else
ive
had
that
if
i
could
only
have
one
beer
for
the
rest
of
my
life
this
is
the
one
it
would
be
thank
you
stone
all
in
all
this
is
a
good
beer
very
very
complex
i
think
the
heavy
hops
are
overpowering
and
i
have
trouble
recognizing
the
other
flavors
overall
this
is
a
total
classic
in
craft
beer
a
total
goto
beer
for
those
who
like
strong
ales
will
get
this
again
aboslutely
stone
continues
to
blow
my
mind
o
definitely
give
this
a
try
very
nice
o
arrogant
bastard
ale
is
marketed
correctly
id
say
its
a
wild
brew
with
some
serious
flavor
and
a
lot
of
complexity
which
is
miraculously
well
organizedit
doesnt
taste
like
everything
at
once
it
also
does
a
good
job
of
keeping
a
first
timer
on
their
toes
looking
like
a
dark
brew
smelling
like
an
ipa
and
tasting
like
a
well
balanced
red
ale
with
some
uncharacteristic
qualities
arrogant
bastard
ale
might
have
to
be
a
repeat
buy
you
know
just
so
i
can
get
more
acquainted
and
perhaps
even
worthy
palate
grassy
with
citrus
floral
bitter
finish
that
feels
good
on
the
ol
mouth
roasted
malts
are
also
available
to
the
taste
buds
very
good
tasting
nice
bold
beer
d
drinkability
is
pretty
high
although
the
bitterness
can
be
tiring
o
this
is
a
phenomenal
beer
this
is
the
second
american
strong
ale
that
really
made
me
take
notice
of
the
awesomeness
of
beer
the
first
being
rogues
dead
guy
ale
several
years
ago
before
i
started
to
get
all
nerdy
about
beer
o
a
solid
strong
ale
that
is
as
it
states
not
for
everyone
it
has
wonderful
bitter
flavor
but
also
has
some
sweet
sugar
notes
that
balance
the
beer
the
head
is
wonderful
and
the
finish
has
great
bite
however
it
is
not
a
beer
to
sit
back
and
drink
a
six
pack
it
is
a
beer
that
you
enjoy
a
bit
at
a
time
dr
too
difficult
to
drink
for
the
abv
the
flavours
are
a
damned
distraction
the
price
is
higher
than
it
should
be
its
far
from
awful
but
i
wouldnt
have
it
again
this
beer
packs
a
pine
punch
in
the
face
with
the
most
curious
and
enigmatic
aroma
ive
come
across
the
aroma
has
almost
nothing
to
do
with
the
taste
but
that
just
adds
to
the
complexity
of
this
fine
ale
after
drinking
my
first
glass
of
this
bomber
i
feel
like
i
can
scrape
hop
resin
off
my
tongue
its
hard
to
imagine
what
kind
of
food
would
hold
its
own
against
this
monster
of
a
beer
been
a
while
since
i
had
this
on
tap
it
used
to
be
my
go
to
beer
when
i
was
craving
some
hops
and
bitterness
i
had
this
beer
after
an
dipa
and
it
still
had
that
awesome
bitterness
it
doesnt
have
that
same
affect
that
it
did
so
many
years
ago
but
still
in
my
top
ten
that
is
readily
available
overall
this
is
definitely
one
of
my
absolute
favorite
beers
and
its
one
that
i
drink
very
frequently
o
fantastic
beer
its
what
really
got
me
into
craft
beer
this
is
an
outstanding
brew
but
at
17
99
a
six
pack
and
65
00
a
case
who
is
being
arrogant
here
quite
thick
and
viscous
between
soft
and
firm
lingering
bitterness
diminishes
drinkability
especially
in
a
22
oz
bottle
a
good
beer
but
overrated
in
my
opinion
in
california
they
serve
this
on
the
pacific
surfliners
the
trains
that
go
up
and
down
the
coast
that
along
with
stones
ipa
and
i
think
the
best
way
to
enjoy
one
is
from
right
in
the
cafe
car
of
the
784
this
beer
is
a
tawny
red
with
a
reddish
cappuccino
head
the
lacing
is
fantastic
the
nose
has
green
tea
aroma
with
toasty
and
caramel
notes
the
hops
come
on
in
the
second
half
and
leave
a
deep
sprucey
bitterness
that
lingers
that
draws
you
in
for
another
drink
the
mouthfeel
is
full
and
lush
i
think
this
is
a
great
beer
that
is
not
nearly
as
bitter
and
extreme
as
i
remember
but
a
great
drink
d
a
really
complex
interesting
brew
to
me
this
is
strictly
a
sipping
beer
so
the
drinkability
is
not
high
the
taste
is
impressive
this
is
the
first
time
ive
had
it
on
tap
and
it
does
not
disappoint
0
an
excellent
ale
with
alot
of
body
and
character
perfectly
combined
ingredients
that
makes
this
beer
an
outstanding
a
o
a
great
ale
good
hop
presence
though
it
could
do
with
some
more
hop
presence
throughout
od
its
a
classic
aggressive
beer
on
tap
is
ideal
but
take
it
any
way
you
can
get
it
one
of
the
few
beers
ive
had
on
tap
in
new
brunswick
nj
that
i
can
honestly
enjoy
ive
had
it
many
times
out
of
the
bottle
and
on
tap
its
much
more
enjoyable
than
the
typical
beers
served
in
a
college
town
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
to
find
the
beer
on
tap
and
have
had
it
a
few
times
the
flavor
is
noticeably
better
on
tap
and
considerably
more
enjoyable
perhaps
it
was
the
environment
or
maybe
my
state
of
mind
but
either
way
it
is
an
all
around
great
beer
i
recommend
to
anyone
who
is
in
the
mood
for
a
flavorfulsomewhat
strong
beer
overall
an
excellent
beer
which
supposedly
makes
me
not
worthy
enough
to
give
it
a
perfect
5
i
treat
it
as
a
special
delicacy
and
would
never
consume
it
regularly
due
to
its
extreme
pleasurably
antagonizing
experience
its
incredible
but
i
would
never
introduce
people
to
craft
beer
with
ab
what
i
love
about
ab
is
how
selfconscious
it
is
of
the
fact
that
its
not
for
everyone
i
totally
am
enamored
with
it
however
and
am
happy
to
see
that
its
available
everywhere
truly
a
living
legend
in
the
craft
brewing
world
o
as
if
you
didnt
know
yet
stone
arrogant
bastard
is
top
notch
stuff
this
may
well
become
my
go
to
bomber
this
is
a
phenomenal
beer
i
plan
to
add
a
bottle
to
my
beer
cellar
i
may
even
seek
out
the
oak
aged
version
poured
a
nice
reddish
color
with
a
solid
and
lasting
head
the
head
is
one
of
those
thick
juicy
ones
that
doesnt
want
to
let
go
love
that
smells
of
roasted
malt
character
mostly
without
much
if
any
hop
aroma
the
taste
is
solid
malt
and
a
nice
balanced
bitterness
a
clean
yet
full
mouthfeel
rounds
out
a
brew
that
is
solid
but
dont
expect
a
new
twist
here
o
its
a
strong
ale
high
on
hops
not
something
that
im
used
to
drinking
but
is
still
very
well
built
and
just
a
damn
good
beer
this
ale
is
a
shapeshifter
from
start
to
finish
it
begins
like
a
sweet
syrupy
old
ale
or
scottish
ale
then
takes
a
lefthand
turn
into
ipa
bitterness
territory
this
is
quickly
muddled
by
stormy
clouds
of
stout
roastiness
but
the
warm
esters
make
a
comeback
in
the
end
leaving
the
palate
utterly
dumbfounded
but
somehow
satisfied
overall
kickass
beer
the
first
thing
i
notice
every
time
is
the
quality
smell
it
really
sets
up
the
flavor
for
the
entire
arrogant
bastard
experience
o
overall
this
beer
is
just
plain
good
no
major
flaws
just
darn
right
good
o
this
is
a
thick
heavy
brew
that
offers
a
substantial
amount
of
flavor
in
every
sip
as
the
bottle
warns
you
really
need
a
developed
palate
to
be
able
to
truly
appreciate
the
flavor
profile
of
this
brew
a
solid
a
brew
that
is
thoroughly
enjoyable
when
only
a
fullflavored
beer
will
do

a

beer
poured

with

stone
beer
has
a

heavy

it

very
well

another
very
tasty
beer
to
try
on

o
oh
yeah
good
beer
good
smell
the
taste
is
with
a
very
bitter
hop
a
bit
too
hoppy
for
me
overy
good
to
excellent
cant
really
define
this
beer
type
sortoff
a
ipa
but
sort
of
a
pale
ale
not
sure
not
unforgettable
but
will
try
again
when
the
mood
is
right
edit
by
the
end
of
the
bomber
the
edge
has
worn
off
of
the
bitterness
and
its
a
lot
more
enjoyable
my
palate
has
probably
just
gotten
a
lot
more
used
to
it
pours
a
hefty
two
finger
head
the
head
is
very
close
to
white
but
not
quite
the
head
is
retaining
itself
very
well
not
going
anywhere
so
far
it
looks
very
frothy
too
lots
of
small
bubbles
a
few
big
ones
the
body
has
a
deep
red
color
with
hints
of
brown
its
barely
see
through
for
the
most
part
its
cloudy
and
you
cannot
see
through
it
at
all
but
at
some
points
you
can
this
beer
looks
very
good
the
head
is
still
there
wow
on
one
hand
this
beer
smells
very
standard
just
a
hoppy
ale
with
some
malt
and
not
much
else
however
there
is
a
very
lively
feeling
to
it
i
dont
necessarily
pick
up
fruit
on
the
nose
but
i
just
feel
like
its
going
to
be
there
its
a
weird
feeling
because
its
a
unique
smell
but
i
cant
quite
distinguish
whats
so
unique
about
it
one
thing
is
for
sure
it
smells
hoppy
and
intriguing
interesting
taste
not
as
hoppy
as
i
thought
it
would
be
on
the
smell
the
malts
are
also
a
lot
more
noticeable
there
may
be
some
hints
of
fruit
in
here
but
they
are
very
very
small
it
tastes
very
standard
but
at
the
same
time
its
a
very
unique
standard
its
hard
to
explain
but
for
sure
a
unique
taste
even
if
it
is
very
subtle
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
damn
good
its
not
huge
but
its
pretty
substantial
for
what
a
strong
ale
should
be
and
on
some
sips
you
get
some
creaminess
from
the
head
which
is
still
there
btw
which
is
very
nice
drinkability
isnt
too
bad
either
like
i
said
the
hops
arent
as
present
as
i
thought
they
would
be
which
is
a
little
disappointing
but
it
makes
for
a
smoother
more
balance
drinking
overall
this
is
a
very
solid
beer
i
would
call
it
a
unique
beer
but
in
very
subtle
ways
its
not
the
craziest
beer
out
there
but
it
has
a
nice
personality
too
it
and
it
is
of
course
well
crafted
i
say
of
course
because
stone
makes
good
beer
overall
its
good
nothing
great
but
glad
to
have
it
at
a
bar
my
friends
want
to
go
to
the
first
time
i
tried
to
buy
beer
i
was
told
to
try
this
and
i
asked
if
it
was
any
good
after
reading
the
label
well
the
labels
right
odds
are
you
wont
like
it
i
put
the
bottle
down
and
i
bought
something
else
today
i
proudly
drink
this
beer
from
an
arrogant
bastard
specialty
glass
stem
and
all
arrogant
bastard
is
an
egotistical
condescending
asshole
of
a
beer
but
like
they
say
its
hard
to
be
humble
when
you
know
youre
great
though
its
definitely
rough
around
the
edges
ab
always
seems
to
deliver
the
kick
in
the
ass
my
tastebuds
crave
overall
fairly
solid
but
i
think
theres
other
bastards
for
stone
that
i
would
have
and
prefer
overall
a
great
beer
i
dont
know
that
ill
drink
it
all
the
time
but
it
was
good
and
im
glad
i
drank
it
i
will
always
have
a
big
heart
for
this
beerit
was
the
first
real
beer
that
got
me
into
real
beer
to
this
day
it
is
still
my
gold
standard
for
beer
app
its
a
dark
ruby
amber
it
has
a
strong
smell
piney
in
the
front
and
in
the
back
it
just
tastes
like
o
this
is
what
a
beer
is
sour
at
the
start
super
piney
at
the
endgreat
thick
mouthfeel
everyone
should
drink
this
atleast
twice
i
didnt
especially
care
for
this
one
to
start
out
but
towards
the
end
of
the
bomber
i
was
loving
it
note
as
the
beer
warms
the
malt
really
starts
to
show
its
true
colors
so
i
would
recommend
letting
it
sit
out
at
room
temperature
a
bit
before
consuming
if
you
want
a
more
balanced
beer
overall
a
very
nice
blend
of
sweetness
and
bitterness
i
think
the
description
on
the
bottle
is
a
little
misleading
as
it
makes
it
sound
like
this
a
hopbomb
like
a
dipa
the
bitterness
is
mild
enough
for
someone
who
isnt
a
hophead
to
enjoy
overall
a
very
solid
brew
finish
a
bitter
hops
with
a
little
maltyness
definitely
good
though
im
not
blown
away
by
the
flavor
or
the
aroma
the
aroma
is
a
little
light
and
the
bittering
hops
in
the
flavor
just
kinda
come
in
and
smack
my
tongue
around
that
said
it
is
quite
smooth
moderately
complex
and
rather
easy
drinking
for
a
beer
with
this
much
alcohol
and
bitterness
o
great
beer
beer
is
good
enough
to
deserve
a
5
somewhere
but
since
its
just
all
around
solid
ill
put
it
here
o
this
ale
has
alot
in
the
bottle
and
i
found
it
quite
tasty
and
a
pleasure
to
drink
it
was
sweethoppy
and
bitter
just
great
overall
this
is
a
powerful
raw
brew
that
kicks
tail
the
intense
bitterness
was
not
really
my
thing
but
this
is
a
beer
to
be
respected
definitely
an
arrogant
bastardme
no
like
but
good
for
you
hop
heads
the
next
time
youre
out
and
feel
like
being
an
arrogant
bastard
go
out
and
buy
an
arrogant
bastard
to
see
how
it
feels
and
tastes
you
deserve
it
and
so
does
the
beer
poured
from
bottle
into
snifter
deep
redmohogany
in
color
with
small
amount
of
beige
head
that
sticks
around
excellent
lacing
aroma
is
of
barley
light
on
hops
some
walnuts
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
taste
is
of
barley
some
hops
earthy
slightly
nutty
dry
slightly
sweet
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
stone
brews
the
bastard
line
starts
here
obviously
a
classic
and
a
really
really
tasty
and
complex
beer
i
prefer
this
to
the
oaked
version
though
thats
pretty
decent
as
well
overall
it
is
worth
a
try
to
get
a
feel
for
what
this
really
cool
brewery
can
do
this
is
an
ale
not
quite
like
any
other
bold
and
daring
it
is
well
named
pours
a
deep
dark
amber
hazy
frothy
billowy
white
head
floats
on
top
smells
of
hops
sweet
malts
caramel
and
has
some
floral
notes
tastes
of
bitter
bitter
hops
has
some
distinctive
aftertastes
and
oily
resins
do
not
let
the
sweet
scent
fool
you
it
does
not
come
into
play
in
the
taste
this
is
a
complex
and
layered
strong
ale
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
sticky
overall
its
a
really
nice
beer
o
one
of
my
favorite
beers
this
offers
something
new
and
interesting
with
every
sip
doesnt
compromise
on
any
aspect
im
still
confused
bc
i
know
this
beer
has
more
to
offer
then
a
b
will
review
one
day
next
week
this
beer
is
a
classic
a
pioneer
and
ultimately
simply
delicious
o
a
nice
solid
beer
i
tend
to
prefer
a
little
more
hopness
in
my
beers
but
thats
not
what
this
ones
all
about
you
arrogant
bastard
they
got
this
right
when
they
came
up
with
the
name
this
is
one
strong
ale
im
with
most
people
when
saying
this
is
a
beer
that
you
start
with
and
go
nowhere
else
or
end
the
night
with
it
it
will
linger
with
you
and
mess
with
whatever
other
flavors
you
attempt
to
put
with
it
smooth
feel
caramel
flavors
and
moderate
carbonation
make
this
an
exceptional
beer
d
very
drinkable
if
you
are
sophisticated
enough
to
enjoy
it
large
bottle
and
high
alcohol
conent
means
you
cant
knock
back
6
or
7
but
you
will
greatly
enjoy
what
you
do
drink
overalldrinkability
this
beer
seem
like
a
chore
to
drink
just
not
my
cup
of
tea
this
beer
drinks
bigger
than
it
actually
is
its
a
great
presentation
of
a
unique
beer
not
a
black
ipa
not
a
double
ipa
more
than
a
big
brown
ale
or
double
amber
its
a
lot
of
ingredients
that
are
blended
together
well
to
create
a
stand
alone
flavor
d
for
a
big
beer
and
7
2
it
goes
down
pretty
smooth
overall
enjoyable
and
delicious
the
drinkability
of
this
ale
for
me
is
very
high
ive
has
this
now
several
times
and
every
gulp
leaves
me
wanting
more
highly
recommended
this
is
my
first
site
review
and
first
review
of
anything
by
stone
brewing
co
arrogant
bastard
ale
is
an
excellent
beer
going
down
has
a
great
start
mouthfeel
and
finish
im
enjoying
mine
as
im
writing
this
looks
wonderful
in
a
glass
has
a
beautiful
amber
glow
to
it
with
lots
of
froth
poured
wonderfully
from
bottle
to
glass
drinkability
very
drinkable
dont
know
if
you
could
drin
ka
lot
of
this
stuff
though
its
a
little
high
on
the
alcohol
content
an
a
i
remember
having
it
on
tap
and
liking
it
more
the
second
time
around
it
seemed
there
wasnt
much
to
it
i
cant
say
i
remember
it
all
too
well
but
that
says
something
since
it
was
less
than
a
month
ago
that
i
had
it
last
i
remember
a
slight
hint
of
fruit
that
wasnt
strong
enough
to
really
do
much
for
the
beers
otherwise
bland
taste
d
very
drinkable
goes
down
well
though
the
abv
is
getting
up
there
for
a
session
drink
d
easily
poundable
ale
offering
some
nice
bold
hop
flavours
with
malt
undertones
the
abv
goes
completely
unnoticed
and
the
hops
are
easily
appreciated
by
any
hop
head
theres
a
reason
this
one
is
top
rated
it
aint
no
joke
this
is
such
a
distinctive
beer
i
really
cant
compare
it
to
anything
else
and
i
like
that
to
me
this
is
a
world
class
beer
the
name
says
it
all
even
the
label
is
arrogant
this
brew
is
a
very
crisp
ale
with
slight
bitterness
and
can
also
be
purchased
as
double
ale
the
abv
makes
this
brew
a
little
bit
of
a
kick
and
the
price
is
a
little
high
but
the
taste
and
smell
dont
let
you
down
it
comes
in
a
four
pack
as
well
along
with
three
other
stone
brews
excellent
thank
you
drinkability
man
this
beer
is
really
really
good
unbelievably
easy
to
drink
considering
the
bold
characteristics
and
the
high
abv
i
dont
know
how
or
why
i
havent
tried
this
yet
considering
how
popular
it
is
i
definitely
wont
pass
this
up
ever
again
a
very
very
nice
and
well
made
beer
d
i
am
pounding
this
bomber
it
just
hits
the
spot
amazingly
well
after
walking
around
the
city
for
a
few
hours
i
had
a
slightly
rough
throat
i
would
say
this
is
an
excellent
beer
for
allergies
or
a
slight
sore
throat
form
a
cold
when
i
have
a
cold
i
like
bitter
soothing
hoppy
beers
this
would
fit
the
bill
exceptional
drinkabilty
amazing
beer
drinkability
this
strong
ale
lived
up
to
its
name
it
was
certainly
memorable
grabbing
hold
of
the
taste
buds
and
not
letting
go
this
isnt
the
kind
of
beer
you
select
for
a
night
of
continuous
drinking
its
a
sipping
beer
not
an
easydrinking
one
for
a
proper
purpose
id
definitely
buy
it
again
d
just
not
that
drinkable
for
me
because
of
the
hops
gotta
respect
stone
though
for
delivering
a
brew
that
is
exactly
what
they
claim
d
slightly
higher
abv
but
a
nice
medium
bodied
beer
i
think
you
might
want
to
start
with
another
beer
before
you
have
one
of
these
otherwise
it
takes
a
few
sips
before
your
palate
can
adjust
and
start
to
pick
up
on
the
nuances
of
this
heavy
ale
one
of
the
only
beers
of
its
kind
in
the
general
marketplace
a
dark
bitter
american
red
d
spectacular
the
name
is
fitting
i
believe
this
brew
is
definitely
something
worth
seeking
out
and
trying
it
is
strong
and
complex
making
it
exciting
to
drink
a
beer
that
no
two
drinkers
will
describe
as
exactly
the
same
pours
a
deep
copper
colour
one
finger
of
sticky
white
head
some
lacing
on
the
glass
this
one
looks
mean
smells
of
citrus
pine
grapefruit
malty
toffee
notes
and
a
faint
sweetness
are
present
taste
is
nice
and
hoppy
citrus
and
pine
notes
come
out
in
the
flavour
great
balance
with
the
malt
dry
hop
finish
with
grapefruit
rounding
it
out
nice
full
mouthfeel
hop
oil
slickness
and
a
medium
amount
of
carbonation
drinks
very
well
could
session
this
if
abv
wasnt
so
high
near
perfect
really
solid
brew
as
usual
from
stone
aroma
included
pine
and
a
touch
of
grape
taste
was
unique
intense
with
malt
and
hops
that
went
on
forever
insanely
complex
finishes
a
little
bitter
and
dry
but
nothing
to
detract
from
my
enjoyment
a
big
big
beer
but
not
too
too
strong
at
7
2
abv
stone
is
really
good
at
incorporating
big
beer
flavor
without
knocking
you
on
your
ass
with
inflated
abv
numbers
overall
a
very
outside
the
box
product
from
the
folks
at
stone
i
cant
wait
to
move
to
a
state
where
their
products
will
be
more
available
to
me
this
beer
packs
a
punch
and
puts
light
beers
in
their
place
i
was
skeptical
from
the
big
talk
marketing
campaign
but
this
beer
lives
up
to
its
own
smack
talk
i
cannot
see
any
flaws
in
this
brew
d
surprisingly
drinkable
though
can
have
the
effect
of
turning
the
drinker
into
an
arrogant
bastard
if
overdone
this
beer
is
best
to
be
enjoyed
at
a
steady
sipping
pace
it
would
be
a
good
beer
for
drinking
while
chatting
with
friends
at
a
pub
after
work
pours
a
medium
dark
caramel
color
with
a
perfect
two
finger
head
the
smell
is
fruity
hoppiness
with
a
little
malt
thrown
in
knowing
stones
reputation
for
big
beer
tastes
im
surprised
the
smell
isnt
a
little
stronger
maybe
it
will
get
stronger
when
it
warms
a
little
ah
but
the
taste
delivers
this
beer
slaps
you
in
the
face
and
says
pay
attention
great
taste
with
lots
of
hops
mixed
w
citrus
and
some
malt
thrown
in
as
well
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
it
has
a
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
which
lingers
the
drinkability
is
good
but
this
beer
makes
me
want
to
sip
it
enjoy
it
it
feels
like
an
1011
beer
but
its
only
7
2
another
great
beer
from
stone
everything
ive
had
of
theirs
has
been
great
and
this
is
no
exception
cheers
i
would
love
to
have
a
case
of
these
overall
an
aggressive
american
strong
ale
nothing
particularly
special
about
it
no
resin
to
be
found
like
sierra
nevada
but
the
greatness
of
this
beer
lies
in
the
taste
its
relatively
strong
in
the
alcohol
department
but
when
i
drank
this
i
would
have
never
have
guessed
that
i
split
this
with
a
friend
but
it
would
have
been
pretty
easy
to
finish
on
my
own
and
even
though
there
are
better
offerings
by
this
brewer
and
in
this
style
of
beer
one
couldnt
do
wrong
with
this
i
could
easily
see
it
being
the
standby
for
quite
a
few
people
that
enjoy
craft
beer
a
very
aggressive
strong
ale
highly
hopped

d
i
was
glad
i
had
a
bomber
ab
is
a
solid
beer
and
a
good
introduction
into
the
world
of
higher
abv
more
flavorful
beers
while
now
it
doesnt
impress
me
like
it
once
did
drinking
it
again
takes
me
down
memory
lane
when
craft
beer
could
not
have
been
any
more
exciting
md
medium
bodied
very
creamy
has
a
bitter
dry
finish
overall
quite
good
a
little
heavier
on
the
malt
than
expected
but
something
i
would
definitely
drink
again
dmay
be
hard
to
drink
for
some
but
i
love
the
bitter
malty
sweet
flavors
that
come
with
this
beer
very
good
beer
have
a
few
of
these
and
get
pretty
tipsy
i
dont
think
i
could
have
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
night
unless
i
felt
particularly
aggressive
this
beer
is
my
go
to
it
has
a
great
taste
and
is
easy
to
get
anywhere
for
the
reasonable
price
i
have
had
this
on
draught
as
well
and
its
even
better
if
you
are
an
ale
fan
this
is
one
to
try
or
retry
i
would
like
to
try
and
make
my
own
personal
brew
similar
to
this
one
this
is
my
favorte
beer
its
is
very
drinkable
but
has
the
sublte
alcohol
notes
along
with
an
almost
nutty
essance
and
overall
hoppy
charecteristics
its
got
great
between
dark
and
amber
color
its
got
a
mild
head
that
laces
pretty
good
in
the
glass
final
thought
big
but
easy
to
drink
huge
but
not
overwhelming
just
wish
this
one
came
in
a
six
pack
had
this
on
tap
at
mr
goodbar
in
buffalo
i
havent
had
this
for
a
while
so
i
had
to
order
it
when
i
saw
it
on
tap
pours
an
amberbrown
colour
with
small
offwhite
head
some
lacing
down
the
glass
head
remains
the
whole
way
smells
of
citrus
hops
with
a
huge
caramel
malt
blast
very
sweet
flavour
bitterness
comes
through
more
in
the
after
taste
smooth
mouthfeel
this
beer
is
a
classic
for
a
reason
d
very
drinkable
this
should
be
in
the
firge
at
all
times
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
and
to
see
it
on
tap
was
pure
mind
blowing
goodness
overall
my
system
was
shocked
by
this
unique
balance
one
of
the
few
i
had
where
the
taste
didnt
necessarily
follow
the
nose
great
beer
excellent
mouthfeel
and
creaminess
very
drinkable
highly
recommended
d
the
alcohol
blends
seamlessly
with
the
sharp
flavours
definitely
in
your
face
but
dangerously
drinkable
all
good
very
good
but
not
bowlmeover
good
so
were
clear
this
beer
is
very
sessionable
and
drinkable
i
wouldnt
hesitate
to
grab
this
again
but
not
worth
a
road
trip
either
someone
picked
this
up
for
me
as
a
gift
very
large
bottle
and
very
large
alcohol
content
which
is
always
good
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
the
only
problem
with
large
bottled
beer
they
get
warm
too
quick
and
you
have
to
down
them
i
would
rather
see
smaller
bottles
cans
so
you
can
enjoy
it
more
good
brew
very
nice
amber
color
w
one
finger
head
that
lingers
as
a
nice
lace
around
the
glass
carmel
and
vanilla
smell
on
the
nose
mouth
feel
is
good
w
nice
carbonation
alcohol
is
fairly
prominent
will
pick
this
up
again
if
the
price
is
right
glad
i
tried
it
i
wont
say
id
never
drink
it
again
but
at
12
for
one
bottle
i
definatly
wont
ever
buy
it
again
d
the
flavors
in
this
beer
are
bold
but
i
find
myself
always
wanting
to
go
back
to
the
glass
and
explore
those
flavors
and
decipher
them
the
alcohol
is
not
incredibly
noticeable
and
after
the
beer
is
almost
room
temperature
it
still
tastes
great
and
goes
down
easy
d
this
is
a
damn
fine
ale
that
you
will
find
hard
to
match
hands
down
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
i
almost
was
not
worthy
of
its
arrogance
but
i
loved
it
too
much
to
not
finish
it
this
is
a
beast
of
a
beer
approach
with
caution
and
you
will
be
rewarded
moreys
bottom
line
believe
it
or
not
this
is
only
the
2nd
time
that
ive
had
this
beer
i
sometimes
shy
away
from
purchasing
stone
because
ive
had
out
of
date
bottles
over
here
on
the
east
coast
but
this
bottle
seems
fresh
enough
glad
i
purchased
this
bad
boy
d
i
could
drink
it
all
night
great
on
tap
id
like
to
have
it
in
a
better
glass
the
booze
makes
itself
known
but
isnt
overpowering
everything
i
would
want
out
af
a
strong
ale
d
i
would
say
this
could
be
rather
drinkable
for
me
on
the
right
day
if
bitter
beers
are
youre
thing
youll
definitely
love
this
its
not
for
everyone
youre
not
worthy
this
was
a
very
drinkable
beer
wish
that
i
was
not
driving
and
could
have
had
another
the
cpj
oíche
mhaith
the
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
tan
head
the
aroma
is
heavy
on
the
piney
hops
and
the
caramel
malt
the
flavor
is
very
hoppy
and
high
in
alcohol
i
get
a
lot
of
pine
and
orange
as
well
as
some
caramel
malt
still
this
beer
is
all
about
the
hops
and
the
bitterness
is
about
medium
fairly
boozy
overall
low
carbonation
and
medium
mouthfeel
very
drinkable
goes
down
easily
happy
to
sip
on
this
one
and
will
be
happy
to
buy
it
again
very
drinkable
for
me
it
got
better
with
every
sip
and
not
thats
not
because
of
the
high
alcohol
p
worth
sitting
back
and
enjoying
on
its
own
not
really
one
you
want
to
pound
or
have
too
many
of
a
bomber
of
this
is
enough
for
an
enjoyable
evening
with
a
good
beer
d
they
served
this
in
a
20oz
pint
so
i
took
a
decent
amount
of
time
with
it
but
its
a
very
easy
drinker
at
this
point
for
me
d
fantastic
drinkability
every
time
i
put
this
beer
down
i
pick
it
right
back
up
again
i
would
go
well
out
of
my
way
for
this
beer
if
it
werent
available
to
me
overall
see
taste
and
drinkability
very
good
but
not
quite
what
i
hoped
served
from
bottle
into
a
stone
nonic
poured
redorange
with
a
two
finger
very
light
tan
that
subsided
to
one
finger
slowly
maintained
phenomenal
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
dark
fruit
sweet
hops
and
caramel
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
dark
fruit
dark
chocolate
sweet
hops
and
slight
citrus
it
had
a
medium
feel
on
the
palate
with
mild
carbonation
overall
this
was
brew
was
great
had
a
very
excellent
flavor
and
good
aroma
going
on
here
both
the
flavor
and
aroma
were
very
well
balanced
and
quite
complex
at
the
same
time
not
too
much
missing
here
a
must
try
if
you
have
not
already
d
ready
for
another
halfway
through
the
first
pour
complex
taste
yet
smooth
for
the
abv
a
winner
for
sure
d
lots
of
bitterness
but
not
unbalanced
theres
lots
of
malt
to
back
it
up
nice
complexity
and
the
hint
of
alcohol
reminds
you
to
slow
down
with
this
one
that
could
otherwise
go
down
much
too
fast
this
beer
poured
well
as
if
it
knew
it
was
going
to
look
good
ha
beautiful
dark
ruby
red
with
a
great
head
perfect
carb
stone
really
knows
how
to
make
a
beer
smell
good
jeez
must
be
dry
hopping
this
beer
was
very
hoppy
but
it
also
had
a
mellow
minty
herbal
note
in
there
as
well
to
calm
it
down
tasted
amazing
and
was
quite
quaffable
i
poured
twice
22oz
into
the
snifter
and
it
seemed
as
though
the
first
one
went
down
the
hatch
in
no
time
at
all
it
was
just
that
dern
good
that
being
said
it
excels
in
every
category
i
would
expect
nothing
less
from
stone
and
it
doesnt
need
another
review
to
further
cement
its
reputation
but
this
really
is
a
quality
brew
hoppy
but
not
out
of
control
clean
strong
pleasant
taste
great
color
stands
up
to
food
well
mouth
feel
is
nothing
surprising
but
this
should
be
tried
early
on
by
those
getting
into
beer
for
the
first
time
drinkability
good
for
a
strong
ale
it
might
be
good
to
switch
to
a
lower
abv
beer
after
a
while
to
let
yourself
cool
off
but
the
taste
is
something
you
can
keep
running
with
n
reasonably
priced
vs
the
other
imperial
stones
this
is
a
nice
dark
ale
it
looks
kind
of
like
shiner
in
a
glass
but
quite
stronger
i
can
only
buy
it
on
tap
or
in
22oz
but
its
worth
it
just
be
ready
for
the
kick
it
is
much
stronger
than
other
ales
and
will
knock
you
back
if
you
arent
ready
it
isnt
for
the
faint
of
heart
or
weak
tasting
beer
lovers
i
give
two
schlitz
about
arrogant
bastard
this
beer
is
an
outstanding
value
d
tasty
finish
that
makes
you
want
more
and
no
detectable
alcohol
presence
it
tasted
absolutely
delicious
with
the
burger
i
had
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
the
beer
is
very
drinkable
d
very
drinkable
one
of
my
favorite
beers
drinkability
this
is
a
fantastic
ale
im
an
amateur
home
brewer
and
for
my
next
batch
im
gonna
try
to
recreate
something
like
arrogant
bastard
ale
or
at
least
get
somewhat
close
to
it
cheers
overall
this
beer
is
just
too
complicated
for
anyone
that
isnt
used
to
good
beer
if
you
want
a
simple
easily
drinkable
beer
this
isnt
the
brew
for
you
but
if
you
want
something
to
savor
that
will
really
make
you
pause
and
consider
its
characteristics
this
is
definitely
something
to
look
into
id
say
its
a
sterling
example
of
the
ipa
style
drinkablity
described
above
for
all
the
build
up
i
was
expecting
something
more
undrinkable
i
enjoyed
the
majority
of
the
beer
but
would
have
preferred
a
12oz
bottle
to
a
bomber
go
get
some
overall
its
an
awesome
beer
that
deserves
a
spot
in
the
top
100
i
need
to
keep
this
beer
around
more
often
eerie
side
note
on
my
second
pour
the
foamy
glob
that
i
noted
before
actually
became
three
separate
globs
that
looked
just
like
a
smiley
face
is
that
the
gargoyles
soul
laughing
at
me
for
not
getting
the
joke
i
must
not
be
worthy
this
bottle
says
enjoy
by
february
2011
this
beer
pours
a
deep
rich
mahogany
with
a
one
finger
beige
head
it
smells
of
bitter
citrus
hops
and
has
a
light
sweet
maltiness
to
it
its
very
earthy
im
definitely
surprised
by
the
level
of
hops
in
the
nose
it
tastes
of
bitter
and
very
dry
citrusy
hops
it
also
has
this
slight
woodiness
to
it
it
drinks
exceptionally
smooth
im
very
surprised
by
this
bottle
i
remember
it
being
a
little
more
harsh
the
previous
two
or
three
times
id
had
it
its
a
very
good
beer
but
i
couldnt
drink
more
than
this
bottle
it
leaves
this
strange
earthy
and
dry
after
taste
that
im
not
a
fan
of
it
makes
even
finishing
the
bottle
unappealing
stone
always
knows
how
to
properly
hop
their
beers
in
the
manner
they
describe
it
im
never
disappointed
when
they
say
its
going
to
be
bitter
or
very
hoppy
it
always
is
as
soon
as
you
smell
it
you
get
that
trademark
stone
brewery
pine
smell
with
citrus
and
the
sweet
malt
in
the
background
i
love
how
stone
is
one
of
the
only
breweries
that
gets
that
pine
hop
resin
taste
and
mixes
it
real
well
with
citrus
hops
the
malt
really
comes
into
play
in
this
beer
and
almost
reminds
me
of
what
some
breweries
would
call
a
black
ipa
it
kind
of
reminds
me
of
a
hoppier
victory
yakima
glory
but
better
the
roasted
malt
blends
in
so
nicely
with
the
resinous
hop
bite
it
gives
thats
the
word
that
sets
stone
ipa
or
highly
hopped
beers
aside
from
other
breweries
highly
hopped
ipas
resinous
nobody
can
ever
complain
they
dont
get
an
amazing
hop
flavor
and
bite
unless
its
past
due
its
expiration
date
this
might
be
even
hoppier
than
their
regular
ipa
they
brew
mostly
because
of
the
different
hops
they
use
and
the
roasted
malt
coming
together
for
a
more
bitter
bite
amazing
beer
that
regular
beer
drinkers
might
have
a
hard
time
drinking
because
of
the
intense
amount
of
flavor
this
has
beer
never
tasted
so
rich
potent
and
good
i
dont
think
this
brewery
can
make
a
bad
beer
my
favorite
california
brewery
220z
bottle
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
enjoy
by
date
is
21411
pours
an
opaque
reddish
brown
with
three
fingers
of
frothy
foam
good
lacing
nose
is
a
bit
subtle
syrupy
sweet
roasted
malt
with
a
bit
of
bite
from
the
hops
full
bodied
with
low
carbonation
drinks
like
a
breast
not
too
rich
or
syrupy
in
texture
though
nice
resiny
hops
cut
the
malty
sweetness
to
make
it
more
drinkable
nice
roasted
almost
nutty
flavors
play
on
the
palate
before
a
wave
of
hop
bitterness
cuts
through
all
that
to
the
point
that
you
think
your
palate
might
be
ruined
for
the
next
sip
bright
bitter
hops
linger
on
the
finish
every
time
i
have
this
i
am
reminded
how
good
it
is
this
is
the
definition
of
a
classic
microbrew
the
beer
that
popped
my
stone
brewing
cherry
years
ago
usually
poured
from
a
22
oz
bomber
into
pint
glass
dark
amber
brownish
body
with
light
brown
off
white
frothy
head
with
excellent
lacing
interesting
aroma
citrus
earthy
caramel
toast
overall
gentle
on
the
nose
but
what
a
surprise
thereafter
taste
is
predominant
bitter
and
woody
some
spice
bitter
is
not
in
a
pale
ale
or
ipa
sort
of
way
and
much
more
aggressive
than
smooth
palate
is
moderatley
thick
and
syrupy
residue
that
lingers
a
good
while
depth
and
complexity
that
leaves
you
guessing
and
wanting
more
a
nice
beer
next
is
the
double
bastard
and
if
its
anything
like
this
im
doubly
excited
d
really
great
beer
that
starts
strong
and
continues
throughout
good
balance
and
quality
makes
this
a
go
to
beer
excellent
offering
from
stone
if
youve
never
tried
a
stone
product
this
is
the
perfect
place
to
start
classic
brew
recommended
dso
drinkable
and
will
drink
again
this
beer
is
endlessly
drinkable
and
is
something
i
always
keep
a
few
bottles
of
to
drink
fantastic
i
still
find
the
drinkability
a
bit
dangerous
possibly
more
dangerous
ontap
i
do
like
this
beer
but
it
really
isnt
a
favorite
of
mine
if
i
give
the
bottle
another
go
ill
rereview
because
i
think
my
score
is
a
little
high
dark
amber
color
slightly
hazy
about
one
finger
offwhite
head
with
excellent
retention
and
lacing
vaguely
peppery
smell
with
some
fruitiness
underneath
good
mouthfeel
with
fairly
minimal
carbonation
the
hops
really
come
out
in
the
initial
tasting
but
finishes
out
smoothly
stone
brewery
products
just
became
available
in
my
area
in
the
last
year
and
this
is
the
third
example
ive
tried
and
is
as
good
as
the
other
two
looking
forward
to
more
of
the
work
bomber
poured
into
imperial
pint
hazy
dried
blood
red
with
a
small
off
white
cap
with
great
retention
and
lacing
smells
of
burnt
sugar
candied
fruit
resinous
hops
taste
is
bitter
at
first
mellowing
out
a
bit
to
let
the
caramel
and
brown
sugar
maltiness
through
finishes
bitter
medium
body
and
carbonation
a
good
readily
available
brew
overall
just
a
delicious
delicious
beer
i
love
the
balance
in
this
beer
the
bountiful
amount
of
flavors
and
how
the
beer
moves
from
sweet
to
bitter
so
seemlessly
just
outstanding
beyond
being
a
great
beer
this
is
an
important
beer
in
terms
of
the
history
of
american
craft
brewing
its
roots
are
in
classic
english
brewing
but
it
doesnt
conform
to
any
preestablished
style
its
imitators
are
legion
its
equals
few
while
its
spinoff
beers
may
outshine
it
there
is
no
denying
abs
mark
on
the
craft
beer
landscape
i
never
drink
it
out
of
the
bottle
i
have
to
pour
into
a
glass
to
see
the
gorgeous
amber
color
the
smell
is
unmistakable
and
i
take
a
whiff
before
every
drink
the
taste
is
everything
the
bottle
says
and
pairs
with
many
pub
foods
drinkability
makes
my
first
choice
if
i
grab
a
beer
from
stone
a
good
beer
to
take
the
training
wheels
off
and
really
dive
into
the
beer
community
drink
it
was
very
good
especially
paired
with
a
green
chili
burger
last
beer
of
2010
thanks
stone
for
a
great
sendoff
d
as
much
as
you
can
1
afford
2
tolerate
with
the
slightly
elevated
7
2
abv
buy
two
because
after
the
first
you
will
be
wanting
another
what
a
dirty
devil
d
this
offering
has
a
nice
hoppy
presence
highly
flavorful
and
enjoyable
beer
the
alcohol
is
hid
well
by
the
hops
and
is
highly
drinkable
i
cant
believe
its
taken
me
so
long
to
try
it
ontap
wow
a
solid
and
awesome
beer
that
lives
up
to
its
name
the
flavor
is
much
stronger
on
the
front
end
when
consumed
ontap
the
spices
and
malt
practically
kicking
in
the
face
of
any
bastard
lucky
enough
to
drink
a
sip
the
hops
wash
away
the
spice
toward
the
end
leaving
just
a
trace
of
malt
and
hops
on
the
tongue
extremely
drinkable
drinkablity
is
high
for
a
beer
of
this
substantial
character
poured
ontap
at
the
stone
brewery
the
beer
is
a
beautiful
redcopper
color
with
a
thin
ring
of
head
it
has
a
malty
smell
with
hops
undertones
the
flavor
is
initally
a
spicymalt
blast
followed
by
light
bitter
hops
the
flavors
are
very
strong
and
full
and
very
well
balanced
there
is
a
spicy
bitter
aftertaste
to
the
beer
with
a
hoppy
finish
great
beer
with
heavy
nonapologetic
flavors
kudos
d
very
good
american
style
ale
long
on
flavor
mfd
big
body
very
creamy
only
downside
is
that
its
a
palate
wrecker
overall
a
very
enjoyable
brew
medium
bodied
with
light
carbonation
to
keep
the
tongue
clean
fairly
easy
to
drink
but
the
hops
are
bold
enough
to
keep
your
pace
slower
o
complex
and
rich
without
being
over
hopped
great
job
hiding
the
booze
and
nice
profile
overall
notes
love
this
beer
if
you
like
beer
with
big
complex
flavor
and
a
good
dose
of
hoppy
bitterness
then
i
would
say
you
are
worthy
to
have
this
beer
even
though
the
bottle
says
otherwise
will
purchase
this
one
again
when
i
can
find
it
d
quite
aggressively
bitter
finish
that
sticks
around
more
hoppy
than
expected
refreshing
but
strong
sipper
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
brew
was
its
rich
aroma
it
smelled
very
similar
to
a
doppelbock
which
plays
right
to
our
favorites
it
was
buttery
and
roasty
and
sweetly
malty
additionally
the
spiel
on
the
back
of
the
bottle
about
being
too
good
for
everybody
is
awesome
we
also
liked
the
fact
as
advertised
by
the
bottle
that
it
is
a
simple
brew
utilizing
the
most
basic
and
freshest
ingredients
this
too
was
evident
upon
tasting
making
for
an
easy
going
naturaltasting
brew
someone
bought
this
as
a
gift
for
me
about
5
years
ago
it
was
one
of
the
first
really
hoppy
strong
ales
i
had
tried
my
appreciation
for
it
has
only
grown
tremendously
over
those
5
years
d
medium
lots
of
good
flavors
but
the
abv
could
be
a
bit
much
after
a
few
tried
it
ontap
in
a
bar
the
beer
is
deep
mahogany
in
color
aroma
is
all
hops
with
a
slight
hint
of
malt
when
you
smell
it
youll
know
whats
going
to
hit
you
hops
hops
hops
earthy
woody
hops
assault
the
palate
right
away
felt
like
my
mouth
is
burning
finish
is
long
lasting
and
all
hops
wow
so
good
love
it
or
loath
it
this
beer
does
capture
a
great
deal
about
its
brewer
loads
of
brash
character
and
plenty
of
clever
marketing
and
you
may
be
hardpressed
to
find
a
flagship
offering
with
better
value
more
distinctiveness
and
this
level
of
decadent
maltiness
and
brimming
hoppiness
love
him
or
loath
him
arrogant
bastard
is
one
cool
badass
drinkability
definitely
strong
and
if
you
like
hops
it
is
probably
up
your
alley
alcohol
really
hits
you
though
not
very
present
in
the
nose
or
taste
overall
for
the
price
taste
and
fact
that
it
is
only
in
a
bomber
i
probably
wont
find
myself
picking
this
up
too
often
d
wow
the
bitterness
makes
me
want
to
sip
this
one
even
though
the
abv
is
moderate
great
offering
from
stone
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
red
color
with
1
finger
of
head
that
fades
to
a
thin
cap
the
aroma
is
a
mix
of
sweet
caramel
brown
sugar
and
a
little
hint
of
alcohol
creamy
and
fullbodied
up
front
with
a
lot
of
sticky
sweetness
leading
to
tons
of
piney
hop
bitterness
on
the
back
end
the
finish
is
bready
and
lingering
before
becoming
more
bitter
and
slightly
astringent
but
the
overall
effect
leaves
you
wanting
more
this
is
a
big
bold
beer
with
lots
of
flavor
and
quite
delicious
d
very
drinkable
dont
let
the
gargoyle
or
text
on
the
bottle
deceive
you
this
beer
i
could
drink
all
night
d
the
category
says
it
all
strong
ale
despite
the
hype
its
really
just
a
dark
ipa
yes
its
good
but
the
name
goes
a
long
way
toward
earning
the
cult
following
while
the
beers
reputation
is
such
an
established
one
in
the
craft
beer
scene
in
my
humble
opinion
the
recipe
has
been
a
bit
eclipsed
by
other
similar
beers
in
the
last
few
years
but
on
its
own
it
is
still
a
solidly
good
beer
with
its
flavor
profile
still
being
almost
unmistakable
serving
type
bottle
drinkability
yep
this
beer
really
delivers
dont
be
intimidated
by
its
name
or
the
menacing
looking
gargoyle
on
the
bottle
i
suppose
this
beer
is
wicked
in
a
sense
that
it
really
has
some
strong
memorable
characteristics
i
suppose
those
strong
qualities
make
it
arrogant
this
is
a
great
example
of
a
well
made
american
strong
ale
i
would
recommend
this
beer
as
a
gift
to
those
who
you
would
like
to
introduce
to
the
fine
world
of
craft
beers
22oz
bomber
pours
a
dark
rust
color
with
a
thin
frothy
head
some
lacing
nice
hoppy
aroma
picking
up
on
pineapple
and
citrus
fruits
taste
is
a
nice
blend
of
hops
with
tropical
and
citrus
fruit
flavors
malt
flavors
as
well
bitter
aftertaste
this
is
a
full
bodied
beer
that
packs
a
good
amount
of
flavor
while
not
being
to
boozey
at
5
50
this
beer
is
a
great
value
for
the
amount
of
flavor
and
hops
you
get
d
not
exactly
a
session
beer
id
say
its
a
good
beer
to
start
off
a
night
with
before
switching
to
something
a
bit
less
arrogant
though
depending
on
the
next
beer
you
might
mistake
it
for
water
after
tasting
this
beast
drinkability
is
ok
expect
to
finish
your
bomber
and
stop
after
that
unless
you
accidentally
purchased
a
double
jeroboam
and
are
by
yourself
on
a
friday
night
to
which
i
say
good
luck
sir
see
you
in
the
afterlife
d
very
easy
to
put
down
a
bomber
no
alc
presence
a
smooth
drinker
made
writing
a
term
paper
much
more
enjoyable
d
while
i
dont
find
it
that
arrogant
or
bastardly
i
still
enjoyed
drinking
it
one
of
the
harder
beers
to
review
for
me
but
its
because
all
of
the
flavors
are
blending
well
and
somewhat
unique
in
my
opinion
drinkability
the
hop
profile
is
tasty
and
nice
the
alcohol
is
very
strong
but
blends
well
with
the
other
flavors
almost
a
tequila
sunrisey
banded
orangeamberred
appearance
opaque
at
the
darker
bottom
lighter
colors
thin
out
at
the
top
after
the
creamy
beiege
head
settles
sweet
sticky
taste
of
dried
apricot
with
a
very
malty
long
bitter
finish
medium
body
with
midrange
carbonation
alcohol
is
very
subtle
for
a
high
abv
ale
an
exceptional
brew
this
beer
wastes
no
time
in
making
its
presence
known
the
hop
flavors
hit
you
as
soon
as
the
beer
enters
you
mouth
and
is
balanced
nicely
with
a
malty
finish
the
taste
is
good
but
a
bit
overwhelming
it
has
a
very
distinct
syrupy
feel
at
first
rather
malty
and
driven
to
the
total
extreme
opposite
of
what
overtakes
it
within
seconds
an
extremely
robust
bitterness
that
almost
numbs
the
palate
instantly
while
it
may
hold
for
a
solid
pint
the
ibus
certainly
hit
me
superhard
and
it
would
be
tough
to
sip
and
session
this
one
it
also
lacks
the
distinct
woody
musky
feel
the
oab
has
which
certainly
makes
it
a
better
beer
in
my
opinion
nonetheless
this
one
is
quite
a
worthy
sample
of
its
style
and
a
good
beer
by
stone
fuller
medium
body
a
little
dry
and
sticky
feel
but
very
drinkable
the
alcohol
is
masked
really
well
and
you
can
easily
have
a
couple
of
these
before
feeling
satisfied
one
of
my
favorite
regularly
available
strong
ales
aggressive
pour
into
a
sn
pint
glass
yields
a
spectacular
looking
two
finger
head
that
sticks
around
best
retention
i
have
seen
in
a
long
time
beer
is
a
reddish
brown
color
very
enticing
the
head
is
beautiful
aroma
is
hoppy
with
a
sweet
fruity
smell
and
some
grain
taste
is
very
sweet
and
oily
hop
bitterness
coming
through
in
the
end
and
staying
through
the
aftertaste
the
toasted
grain
really
comes
out
in
the
taste
mouthfeel
is
very
sticky
medium
bodied
drinkability
is
average
this
is
a
good
beer
but
not
one
id
want
to
have
more
than
one
or
two
of
in
a
night
as
a
result
of
a
moderately
high
abv
and
the
sweetness
poured
a
frothy
dark
red
from
a
22
oz
bottle
with
abv
the
gargoyle
and
bestby
date
on
the
label
nice
thick
head
which
dissipates
very
slowly
with
very
good
lacing
aroma
is
heavy
on
the
hops
with
hints
of
sweetness
taste
is
an
oily
mix
of
hops
sweet
caramel
notes
and
more
hops
its
a
solid
in
your
face
ale
taste
gets
better
as
the
beer
warms
up
highly
recommended
drinkability
alcohol
warmth
is
barely
noticeable
this
is
one
of
the
more
drinkable
strong
ales
ive
enjoyed
d
just
like
it
says
aggressive
i
love
it
great
finish
with
just
enough
bitter
bite
to
keep
hop
heads
entertained
i
will
make
this
one
of
my
staple
go
to
beers
id
love
to
pair
this
with
some
spicy
fish
tacos
and
mango
salsa
one
day
ill
live
near
the
coast
one
day
this
level
of
brew
could
only
benefit
from
barrelingaging
thankfully
the
good
folks
at
stone
have
concocted
the
oaked
arrogant
bastard
ale
varietal
i
look
forward
to
trying
this
particular
creation
soon
d
i
would
come
back
to
this
beer
eventualy
but
maybe
not
right
away
as
there
are
no
individual
qualities
that
demand
its
consumption
over
other
beers
in
a
night
this
beer
is
heavy
enough
where
i
would
have
to
keep
it
at
a
pint
or
two
cheers
thanks
stone
but
i
know
you
can
do
better
in
the
american
strong
ale
category
if
you
tried
to
brew
a
good
beer
and
not
sell
marketing
with
a
token
beer
to
go
with
please
drop
the
ridiculous
shameless
and
unecessary
marketing
and
brew
a
better
beer
sans
marketing
a
good
product
sells
itself
the
beer
pours
a
deep
amber
reddish
color
with
a
thick
white
head
the
smell
is
strong
mostly
hops
kind
of
a
piney
citrus
aroma
the
taste
is
well
balanced
caramel
and
hop
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
i
would
say
this
beer
is
drinkable
and
yet
one
of
those
beers
youd
want
to
sip
i
could
drink
this
all
night
i
should
definatly
visit
this
more
often
than
i
do
for
a
cheap
5
a
bottle
itll
catch
up
to
you
quick
however
highly
recommended
ill
definatly
be
back
d
one
or
two
is
going
to
be
enough
for
a
night
the
high
bitterness
and
medium
to
high
abv
are
enough
to
keep
you
humble
overall
a
great
beer
though
stones
arrogant
bastard
is
a
big
beer
with
an
inyourface
malty
hoppy
aroma
and
equally
aggressive
flavor
profile
this
is
a
beer
snobs
beer
in
that
its
complexity
of
roasted
malt
west
coast
hops
and
high
abv
challenges
your
senses
not
much
of
a
head
on
its
crystal
clear
reddish
brown
body
but
a
thick
lace
will
follow
it
right
down
to
the
bottom
of
your
glass
this
is
an
intoxicating
beer
both
literally
and
figuratively
that
will
grow
on
you
with
each
draw
not
for
everyone
but
definitely
a
treat
when
pulled
from
a
freshly
tapped
keg
d
aggressive
taste
while
easy
to
drink
and
even
subtle
at
times
the
cockiness
on
the
back
of
the
label
was
justified
there
is
7
2
of
alcohol
in
it
but
i
forgot
about
that
with
all
the
flavor
this
drink
is
quite
impressive
and
i
think
i
prefer
it
over
their
oab
im
not
sure
that
stone
has
or
will
make
a
beer
which
isnt
exceptional
ive
had
this
in
a
bottle
before
but
its
a
whole
new
experience
and
a
lot
better
on
tap
less
of
the
metalic
flavoring
and
smell
when
it
is
on
tap
so
its
more
enjoyable
notes
excellent
offering
from
stone
brewing
company
also
widely
available
at
3
49
a
bomber
its
a
bargain
thats
only
a
dollar
more
than
a
24oz
bmc
product
at
most
convenience
stores
this
drinks
and
feels
good
its
not
too
high
in
alcohol
and
really
doesnt
pose
issues
with
finishing
a
bomber
in
an
evening
this
is
a
fine
beer
if
you
ask
me
mouthfeel
was
a
pleasant
medium
and
drinkability
was
great
great
brew
this
is
a
fantastic
well
balanced
brew
classic
appearance
good
smell
excellent
taste
and
feel
most
importantly
for
a
big
bold
craft
brew
you
can
really
drink
it
its
outstanding
and
a
must
have
for
any
serious
craft
snob
this
just
might
be
my
new
favorite
ale
d
i
finally
deemed
my
self
worthy
enough
to
bring
this
beer
to
my
lips
this
is
pretty
much
how
i
expected
it
to
be
a
lot
of
hoppy
bitterness
without
much
balance
pretty
good
i
dont
know
if
i
am
worthy
enough
for
it
though
id
drink
it
again
but
would
much
prefer
something
else
from
the
stone
arsenal
ok
considering
the
price
and
availability
doubt
id
drink
a
whole
bomber
myself
1
pint
is
more
than
enough
definitely
try
it
again
but
there
are
others
id
choose
first
a
citrus
wonderland
along
with
a
carameled
fruit
malt
makes
mouth
happy
complex
hop
profile
that
keep
going
and
going
just
an
awesome
brew
d
a
bomber
to
myself
is
a
little
too
much
a
little
disappointed
not
what
i
thought
it
would
be
the
abv
is
hidden
by
the
onslaught
of
hops
chad
ws
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
strong
ale
a
little
much
on
the
bitterness
for
my
liking
but
definitely
a
great
brew
nonetheless
kinda
expensive
but
its
worth
it
in
my
opinion
overall
a
nice
beer
its
warming
and
wellbalanced
a
nice
rich
treat
that
goes
especially
well
with
a
fullflavoured
spicy
meal
and
nice
cold
evening
this
is
a
really
great
beer
it
pours
a
thick
redbrown
color
with
and
eggshell
head
the
smell
is
complex
almost
distractingly
so
it
has
rich
aromas
of
citrus
pine
and
malt
tastewise
its
bitter
but
in
a
way
that
detracts
from
the
beer
the
hints
of
fruit
and
barley
come
through
brilliantly
its
thick
as
to
be
expected
and
its
very
drinkable
for
a
strong
ale
stone
thought
it
would
be
a
good
idea
to
add
double
of
everything
and
it
works
amazingly
well
perhaps
the
only
reservation
i
have
with
the
beer
is
a
blatantly
if
not
provocatively
condescending
ad
campaign
which
fits
delicious
taste
great
hop
flavor
with
a
slight
malt
backbone
smooth
mouthfeel
makes
it
easy
to
drink
for
hop
lovers
highly
recommend
for
anyone
that
manages
to
make
it
through
the
entire
bottle
alive
there
is
always
double
bastard
left
to
conquer
the
first
lines
of
the
tome
on
that
bottle
read
this
is
one
lacerative
muther
sic
of
a
beer
it
is
unequivocally
certain
that
your
feeble
palate
is
grossly
inadequate
and
thus
undeserving
of
this
liquid
glory
dvery
high
the
abv
doesnt
detract
if
you
like
hop
bombs
jump
on
this
one
not
complex
the
malts
and
sweet
notes
are
there
and
more
present
as
this
warms
d
highly
drinkable
and
the
malty
finish
keeps
you
coming
back
for
more
this
is
my
first
try
of
this
one
i
have
to
say
im
impressed
poured
with
a
large
head
that
left
loads
of
lacing
smells
of
a
mix
of
hop
and
sweet
malt
this
is
a
tasty
beer
the
hops
are
the
first
thing
to
envelop
the
tongue
with
a
bit
of
sweet
malt
and
then
finishes
with
dry
bitter
hops
again
its
a
heavier
beer
but
i
had
no
problem
taking
down
a
bomber
myself
it
has
a
very
nice
mouthfeel
that
isnt
too
heavy
and
definately
not
too
light
id
definately
have
this
one
again
now
i
cant
wait
to
try
the
oaked
version
i
have
waiting
in
my
fridge
d
pretty
good
beer
probably
not
for
beginners
interesting
and
complex
the
higher
alcohol
is
well
disquised
4
d
overall
i
could
take
down
a
couple
bombers
on
an
empty
stomach
but
it
does
sit
pretty
heavy
this
pours
a
very
nice
dark
red
almost
brownish
color
that
has
a
small
head
with
good
retention
thee
was
some
good
lacing
left
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
smells
hoppy
and
earthy
with
some
malty
sweetness
there
are
also
notes
of
lemon
lime
and
orange
zest
the
taste
of
this
beer
is
just
great
its
hoppy
and
earthy
just
like
the
smell
there
is
a
bitterness
about
this
beer
that
i
like
a
lot
i
also
think
the
sweetness
of
the
malt
cuts
it
nicely
i
also
taste
some
fruity
notes
in
there
and
some
citrus
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
also
very
nice
on
this
it
coats
the
mouth
well
so
you
can
really
taste
it
it
has
a
nice
medium
body
that
is
leaning
a
little
more
towards
the
heavy
end
of
the
spectrum
nice
carbonation
as
well
i
find
this
beer
to
be
very
drinkable
this
is
one
of
my
go
to
beers
and
i
could
drink
these
night
after
night
without
getting
bored
i
think
stone
did
a
great
job
on
this
beer
i
cant
wait
to
crack
my
3liter
bottle
of
double
bastard
and
kick
it
up
a
notch
but
right
now
im
having
this
one
and
its
great
good
job
stone
cheers
m
smooth
is
the
only
word
to
describe
it
the
carbonation
is
just
right
medium
in
body
and
gives
way
to
a
semidry
finish
its
a
good
beer
but
has
quite
a
bit
of
carmel
and
hops
in
the
taste
i
enjoy
a
beer
with
a
good
amount
of
hops
but
i
would
have
liked
a
little
less
carmel
taste
its
iconic
for
a
reason
definitely
an
interesting
beer
d
i
can
only
drink
maybe
20oz
then
i
am
done
it
is
a
good
beer
to
have
a
bottle
of
but
a
6pack
is
too
much
for
me
d
arrogant
bastard
has
a
really
enjoyable
flavor
and
a
solid
mouthfeel
that
lead
to
a
solid
beer
that
i
will
enjoy
many
more
times
in
the
future
its
strange
though
maybe
ive
just
gotten
so
used
to
drinking
big
bold
beer
but
ab
is
not
nearly
the
beast
that
i
remember
it
being
when
i
first
tried
it
now
i
just
think
of
it
as
a
well
crafted
solid
beer
update
had
this
again
on
thanksgiving
night
112813
bought
a
22
at
pinnocchios
in
media
for
6
enjoy
by
date
1414
beer
is
very
hop
forward
with
piney
hops
chinook
and
some
accompanying
citrus
bitterness
is
really
in
your
face
like
a
full
on
hop
assault
malt
complexity
give
this
beer
a
great
backbone
excellent
beer
to
wind
down
with
football
after
eating
a
ton
on
the
holiday
great
nightcap
beer
i
like
this
beer
d
good
thirst
quencher
will
look
for
again
bought
this
beer
in
a
bombersized
bottle
pours
a
dark
amber
with
a
caramel
colored
head
smell
is
deep
and
rich
with
lots
of
malt
mouth
feel
is
thick
and
chewy
taste
is
potent
hence
the
name
but
refined
smooth
enough
for
me
to
drink
more
of
these
than
would
be
good
for
me
very
fullbodied
beer
well
worth
the
price
and
availability
where
i
live
d
a
pretty
good
strong
ale
definitely
a
lot
of
malts
coming
through
in
the
smell
and
taste
but
the
citrus
hops
come
out
nicely
in
the
taste
to
create
a
little
bitterness
have
had
many
times
and
will
have
again
overall
drinkability
on
the
arrogant
bastard
ale
at
7
2
is
moderate
the
pint
size
is
great
for
this
session
and
warrants
a
subsequent
purchase
next
beer
run
solid
stone
beer
and
im
looking
forward
to
trying
more
from
these
arrogant
bastards
bottle
label
reads
quite
funny
drinkabilty
this
22
oz
is
perfect
for
a
sitting
this
has
just
enough
alcohol
in
it
i
could
handle
3
12
ozs
but
thats
all
after
having
this
i
now
know
that
great
lakes
nosferatu
was
created
to
compete
with
this
beer
though
nos
is
slighty
more
hoppy
and
stronger
great
beer
will
drink
again
i
like
how
the
label
says
that
this
is
an
aggressive
beer
to
those
who
like
craft
beer
it
isnt
anywhere
close
however
to
a
macro
drinker
i
suppose
it
would
be
d
its
a
favorite
for
a
reason
and
thats
because
its
undeniably
unique
to
stone
it
reminds
me
of
my
first
taste
of
whiskey
a
real
kick
to
the
mouth
at
first
but
eventually
you
succumb
to
wanting
it
again
and
again
bonus
points
for
possibly
the
most
badass
name
in
beer
as
well
i
decided
it
was
time
to
revisit
this
as
i
have
only
had
this
twice
before
once
was
when
i
wasnt
into
beer
at
all
and
i
thought
it
was
a
scary
beer
the
second
time
was
right
after
i
got
into
beer
and
it
seemed
over
hopped
now
i
can
appreciate
it
this
bottle
didnt
seem
too
hoppy
to
me
could
be
an
older
bottle
or
i
may
just
enjoy
hopped
up
beers
now
over
all
i
enjoyed
it
would
definitely
buy
again
reasonably
priced
as
well
drinkability
only
let
me
have
one
double
deuce
cause
i
could
put
these
down
all
night
long
they
just
taste
so
amazing
one
of
my
top
three
american
brews
of
any
style
this
is
clearly
for
the
beer
drinker
who
appreciates
complex
tastes
enjoys
something
different
initially
i
cant
say
this
goes
down
easy
dont
get
me
wrong
i
like
this
beer
for
being
different
and
the
taste
yet
it
is
quite
bitter
at
the
end
for
me
but
this
is
the
type
of
beer
i
would
enjoy
learning
to
love
with
time
d
arrogant
bastard
exhibits
excellence
in
the
form
of
a
crafted
brew
while
the
alcohol
makes
it
somewhat
of
a
sipper
the
flavor
and
taste
counter
that
aspect
i
could
take
two
bombers
and
call
it
a
night
amazing
this
beer
pours
reddish
black
with
a
foamy
froathy
caramel
head
that
sticks
to
the
glass
as
is
slowly
fades
the
aroma
is
very
strong
from
the
beer
it
is
hoppy
with
toasted
grains
a
little
citrusy
and
the
alcohol
in
the
background
this
beer
is
rich
complex
malty
and
caramel
toasted
and
smokey
the
lingering
taste
is
of
citrus
definately
grapefruit
with
how
biter
it
is
and
dry
it
leaves
your
mouth
this
is
a
big
bold
complex
beer
delicious
brown
in
color
with
an
amber
hue
and
heavy
haze
poured
with
a
thick
offwhite
head
that
reduced
to
a
healthy
cap
lots
of
sticky
lacings
on
the
glass
sweet
caramel
malt
floral
and
piney
hop
aromas
medium
bodied
with
pleasant
carbonation
sweet
malty
flavor
in
the
beginning
that
leads
to
citrus
hops
in
the
middle
and
a
pine
hop
finish
the
higher
abv
slips
in
at
the
end
to
take
the
edge
off
the
mildly
bitter
finish
very
enjoyable
its
tasty
enough
to
set
aside
the
fact
that
its
a
7
2
abv
brew
its
a
beer
which
i
have
enjoyed
countless
times
over
the
years
and
will
continue
to
do
so
though
i
will
make
sure
i
dont
make
the
mistake
of
going
a
year
without
having
it
again
serving
type
bottle
d
leaves
a
weird
cloying
bitterness
that
ive
never
liked
about
this
beer
but
the
hop
fix
this
thing
provides
is
more
than
enough
to
consider
it
drinkable
d
absolutely
just
a
reat
all
around
brew
d
every
sip
is
pure
beerloving
bliss
very
good
strong
ale
had
this
one
flowin
since
they
had
the
old
brewery
off
barham
in
sm
good
memories
for
sure
recommended
by
me
overall
good
beer
at
that
would
probably
buy
again
for
another
tasting
review
but
just
didnt
blow
me
away
i
enjoyed
the
ipa
a
little
bit
more
than
this
one
not
bad
though
worth
a
try
it
is
good
very
drinkable
if
in
the
mood
good
red
medium
beer
great
beer
if
you
love
ipas
this
will
please
you
it
is
a
very
well
crafted
beer
the
lingering
bitterness
leaves
you
wanting
more
a
true
american
original
arrogant
bastard
is
one
of
the
finest
beers
on
the
shelves
today
too
bad
youre
not
worthy
drinkability
smokey
bitter
tart
and
bold
have
to
be
in
the
the
mood
but
when
i
am
its
plausable
to
put
away
more
than
one
bomber
d
this
is
a
solid
beer
by
stone
i
drink
a
few
of
these
a
month
really
enjoy
this
one
by
stone
a
great
widely
available
choice
the
arrogance
is
perhaps
a
little
out
of
hand
though
i
think
thisd
be
a
great
choice
for
someone
just
getting
into
craft
beers
wonderful
thick
long
lasting
light

very
rich
balanced

of

and
lime
with
a
finish
of

this
stuff
is
good
the
citrus
and
hops
remains
on
the
back
of
my
tongue
for
a
good
30
seconds
after
the
brew
has
gone
down
my
throat
creamy
and
tingly
feel
in
my
mouth
and
back
of
my
throat
as
i
drink
a
little
pricey
but
well
worth
the
cost
as
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
drank
up
to
this
time
in
my
life
this
is
not
a
beer
for
the
run
of
the

are

i
would
say
that
this
is
not
the
most
drinkable
beer
especially
for
its
abv
the
complexity
of
this
brew
keeps
me
sipping
away
this
is
definitely
a
go
to
beer
when
wanting
something
flavorful
and
delicious
strong
but
drinkable
definitely
lived
up
to
its
name
a
good
west
coast
strong
ale
w
lots
of
bitterness
that
makes
it
a
challenge
for
me
to
have
more
than
a
couple
the
acidity
seems
to
linger
but
it
achieves
its
goal
arrogance
this
beer
is
not
for
everyone
but
i
still
find
it
highly
drinkable
a
great
beer
that
i
never
second
guess
about
grabbing
or
ordering
on
tap
and
one
is
never
enough
this
is
as
dedlicious
brew
have
to
try
it
once
a
decent
head
with
good
retention
color
is
dark
caramel
with
a
burgundy
tinge
sticky
spots
down
the
length
of
the
glass
quite
clear
4
50
s
heavy
on
the
hops
lots
of
pine
and
citrus
though
alcohol

d
you
will
probably
end
up

drunk
by
the
time
you
realize
that
youve
had
enough
because
the
abv
is
so
well
covered
by
the
complex
flavors
i
could
drink
this
one
all
night
long
very
nice
beer
and
a
terrific
addition
to
the
south
la
beer
scene
notes
what
a
unique
beer
definitely
light
beer
loves
cant
take
this
aggressive
complex
malty
hopbomb
a
very
fragrant
powerful
flavored
yet
sophisticated
beer
this
is
one
of
the
pioneers
of
the
creative
west
coast
craft
beers
outstanding
d
great
drinkability
goes
down
easy
my
favorite
of
this
style
aromatic
with
a
lightly
peppery
hoppiness
that
is
just
a
bit
piney
malt
balance
evident
in
the
nose
smells
of
cookie
dough
and
slightly
fruited
the
flavor
is
quickly
cookielike
but
unique
in
the
sense
that
it
is
quite
dry
not
sweet
sticky
piney
hops
then
appear
and
the
finish
is
mildly
peppery
and
sweet
nice
contrasts
of
flavors
in
each
stage
of
the
flavor
profile
making
a
complex
drinkable
brew
actually
probably
reminds
me
more
of
stone
13th
anniversary
than
the
double
bastard
in
terms
of
the
hop
profile
medium
to
full
body
with
mediumhigh
carbonation
maybe
a
touch
bubbly
for
me
sticky
from
notes
at
the
sierra
grille
tonight
pours
an
extremely
dark
red
with
a
one
finger
full
creamy
offwhite
head
that
leaves
heavy
creamy
lacing
as
it
is
consumed
smells
is
surprisingly
not
as
strong
as
i
expected
smells
of
malts
dark
fruits
hops
and
a
tiny
bite
of
alcohol
would
like
more
strength
out
of
this
tastes
of
malts
dark
fruits
raisins
plums
some
citrus
alcohol
bite
comes
into
play
but
is
good
for
most
of
the
beer
starts
to
take
over
after
most
of
the
glass
is
gone
huge
hops
up
front
before
any
of
the
mentioned
tastes
the
typical
stone
hop
taste
the
balance
is
nice
before
the
alcohol
takes
over
at
the
end
some
chocolate
even
comes
into
play
near
the
end
of
my
glass
medium
body
with
decent
creamyness
and
a
good
balance
of
body
and
alcohol
warming
this
is
probably
my
favorite
aspect
of
the
beer
carbonation
is
medium
and
suits
the
beer
nicely
a
coat
of
dark
fruits
is
left
on
the
tongue
drinkability
is
good
good
taste
the
price
was
not
too
bad
for
the
quality
alcohol
will
certainly
kill
this
one
after
a
while
probably
get
it
again
for
6
a
bomber
nice
on
tap
also
a
favorite
wow
very
tasty
and
complex
brew
that
gets
better
as
it
warms
the
abv
is
a
little
high
to
drink
several
of
these
a
night
but
i
would
if
i
could
however
im
not
worthy
awesome
beer
drinkability
another
superb
offering
from
stone
maybe
it
isnt
quite
as
good
as
their
label
seems
to
claim
but
a
complex
tasty
and
well
put
together
beer
nonetheless
beer
looks
very
good
with
a
brown
slightly
red
colour
and
beautiful
head
that
had
great
retention
smells
pleasant
with
a
strong
hint
of
hops
that
gives
way
to
some
nice
fruity
notes
mostly
citrusy
the
taste
knocks
me
back
a
bit
at
first
very
strong
on
the
hops
but
after
a
few
drinks
there
is
a
definite
malt
to
it
as
well
a
bit
strong
for
sure
and
will
keep
me
satisfied
while
i
like
the
taste
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
what
really
hooks
me
its
difficult
to
put
into
words
but
the
best
i
can
say
is
that
this
is
what
drinking
a
beer
is
supposed
to
feel
like
a
delicious
beer
and
i
could
certainly
drink
another
wow
poured
a
beautiful
amber
with
a
thick
frothy
cream
colored
head
with
great
retention
and
super
sticky
great
lacing
smell
is
malty
then
very
oily
with
hops
citrus
like
taste
starts
out
malty
and
earthy
roasty
even
then
goes
to
very
bitter
floral
hops
tremendously
complex
excellent
beer
i
could
drink
this
all
night
drinkability
it
is
a
strong
ale
with
a
rather
high
abv
so
beware
the
drinkability
to
me
is
scary
i
think
i
could
drink
this
until
i
pass
out
drinkability
what
an
interesting
beer
to
say
the
least
this
beer
solidifies
the
notion
that
i
am
very
excited
stone
has
landed
in
connecticut
this
beer
is
balanced
almost
far
too
well
never
have
i
seen
a
strong
ale
pull
off
not
only
the
nice
bitter
west
coast
hoppiness
but
also
the
malt
balance
that
really
makes
this
beer
a
sure
fire
winner
an
awesome
concoction
from
a
brewer
who
i
cant
wait
to
experience
more
of
their
over
the
top
potions
very
drinkable
but
this
is
a
strong
ale
so
beware
this
is
a
very
drinkable
strong
ale
and
i
am
glad
that
it
is
readily
available
even
on
tap
good
beer
poured
into
a
pint
glass
this
brew
is
an
amber
color
with
a
thick
light
brown
head
that
leaves
the
stickiest
lacing
all
down
the
glass
the
aroma
is
very
complex
there
are
subtle
hints
of
caramel
malts
some
slight
nuttiness
a
mild
hint
of
yeast
and
some
toffee
the
taste
is
bold
the
front
is
sweet
with
the
light
roasted
malts
and
the
full
body
has
a
wonderful
hop
balance
this
brew
has
a
nutty
finish
and
doesnt
in
the
least
over
power
even
with
the
high
abv
wonderful
example
of
a
beer
brewed
by
true
beer
lovers
drinkability
a
great
beer
this
is
my
first
tasting
of
it
i
had
heard
people
raving
about
it
on
this
site
before
but
had
never
gotten
around
to
trying
it
hophead
beers
arent
usually
my
thing
i
know
im
an
oddity
on
this
site
but
this
is
damn
good
try
it
grades
out
somewhere
between
double
bastard
and
oaked
arrogant
bastard
youve
got
to
love
the
bottle
design
though
dont
you
my
typical
preference
for
hoppy
beers
is
to
be
light
in
mouthfeel
and
arrogant
bastard
fits
that
bill
it
has
moderatetohigh
carbonation
and
is
light
enough
to
give
off
feeling
that
youre
drinking
hop
juice
drinkability
absolutely
this
is
a
damn
solid
hoppy
beer
that
i
would
get
down
with
anytime
i
could
i
would
buy
this
with
some
regularity
if
i
could
poured
a
deep
amber
out
of
the
bomber
when
held
up
to
light
beautiful
chestnut
is
revealed
head
is
off
white
slightly
yellow
and
left
its
mark
all
down
the
glass
grapefruity
hops
is
the
first
scent
followed
by
caramel
malts
the
hops
definitely
dominates
im
a
hophead
but
i
really
appreciate
the
balance
of
this
beer
the
odd
thing
is
that
right
in
the
beginning
you
get
a
hint
of
malty
sweetness
this
sweetness
is
very
quickly
overpowered
by
a
nice
hit
of
hops
and
then
reappears
on
the
backend
the
carbonation
is
right
on
tingling
the
tongue
along
with
the
hoppy
bite
really
well
done
dont
expect
anything
else
from
stone
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
just
a
nice
big
balanced
beer
out
of
a
22
ounce
bomber
bottle
and
into
my
nonic
pint
glass
ab
appears
a
hazed
crimson
chestnut
color
with
about
an
inch
of
thick
off
white
foam
the
head
leaves
a
noticeable
lace
in
its
wake
nose
and
flavors
are
of
lemon
peel
resinous
pine
all
kinds
of
grapefruit
white
red
just
about
the
right
amount
of
caramelized
malt
to
pull
it
all
together
toasted
biscuits
nearing
full
bodied
for
the
style
with
ample
carbonation
tasty
bitter
stuff
drinkability
no
need
to
rush
through
this
one
sit
back
and
enjoy
the
ride
as
the
beer
warms
up
and
the
flavors
come
out
one
tall
boy
should
be
a
nights
worth
of
moderate
drinking
when
youre
just
chillin
out
after
a
busy
day
d
this
has
always
been
and
will
be
one
of
my
favorites
and
i
can
always
come
back
to
it
would
be
a
good
beer
for
someone
who
wants
to
try
something
big
and
bold
taste
is
exactly
how
it
smells
delicious
hop
goodness
throughout
the
mouth
you
can
really
taste
the
pine
characteristic
to
the
beer
alongside
the
breadiness
of
the
malt
its
like
a
piece
of
spicy
bread
with
a
sort
of
cinnamon
quality
to
it
the
flavor
then
follows
to
the
sweet
and
sour
citrus
of
the
grapefruit
and
short
astringency
of
the
hop
bitterness
that
lingers
for
a
couple
of
seconds
in
the
aftertaste
before
dissipating
and
finally
it
all
ends
to
the
gentle
warmth
of
the
alcohol
left
in
the
back
of
the
throat
the
mouthfeel
is
just
right
with
a
medium
body
and
enough
carbonation
to
the
brew
the
bitterness
isnt
as
discouraging
as
i
had
originally
thought
when
i
first
tried
it
so
i
say
that
the
drinkability
is
excellent
and
its
definitely
more
of
a
drinker
than
a
sipper
such
a
reliable
strong
ale
i
can
always
go
back
to
this
brew
thanks
again
you
bastard
i
still
am
not
worthy
this
is
a
great
and
unique
beer
if
you
like
this
definitely
try
the
oaked
and
double
versions
both
were
excellent
this
beer
pours
a
rubybrown
color
the
head
is
a
quarter
inch
in
height
and
recedes
slowly
into
nice
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
grapefruit
citrus
and
pine
this
is
the
strongest
grapefruit
smell
ive
encountered
in
a
beer
the
taste
is
almost
a
grapefruit
like
as
the
aroma
but
not
quite
there
is
a
nice
bitterness
in
the
finish
too
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumfull
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
smooth
texture
overall
this
is
a
really
nice
beer
i
held
off
trying
it
for
a
long
time
because
i
really
did
not
like
oaked
arrogant
bastard
this
beer
seems
to
me
to
have
a
lot
more
complexity
get
some
drinkability
a
decent
drinkable
beer
which
hopefully
will
be
more
appreciated
when
i
try
it
outside
of
a
bar
and
in
a
proper
glass
i
tend
to
favor
beers
with
a
more
session
beer
drinkability
but
this
still
stuck
my
fancy
deep
copper
color
with
decent
lacing
definitely
a
musthave
for
any
hopheads
out
there
a
rich
copper
color
with
a
tan
head
hangs
around
with
some
good
lace
smells
of
sweet
malt
flavors
and
citrus
lemon
rind
the
hops
are
strong
with
a
lot
of
lemon
citrus
flavor
but
the
toasted
malt
acts
as
a
strong
counterpoint
and
really
softens
them
it
has
a
campfire
quality
in
the
taste
that
i
found
very
appealing
and
definitely
something
that
lends
this
beer
to
a
more
dynamic
range
of
food
pairings
than
perhaps
a
straight
american
ipa
a
nice
display
of
flavors
overall
and
a
good
dry
finish
on
the
end
i
think
this
was
stones
original
flagship
beer
before
the
ipa
caught
on
and
its
easy
to
see
why
its
a
lovely
beer
that
is
worth
a
try
and
one
that
is
definitely
worthy
of
its
level
of
respect
and
popularity
poured
from
22
oz
bottle
deep
reddish
brown
thin
tan
head
minimal
lacing
smell
of
toasted
grains
hops
and
cookie
dough
bitter
hop
flavor
mixed
with
toasted
malt
some
caramellike
sweetness
mixed
with
malt
and
a
tart
bitter
hop
finish
nice
balance
of
flavors
with
a
hoppy
bitterness
ruling
medium
bodied
with
a
slick
feel
goes
down
easy
definitely
a
quality
brew
a
great
beer
to
start
to
start
or
finish
a
session
with
overhyped
for
sure
but
this
is
still
a
unique
and
tasty
beer
worth
trying
if
you
havent
d
despite
the
high
alcohol
content
this
one
is
surprisingly
drinkable
overall
a
very
well
done
hoppy
brew
d
well
this
beer
is
great
really
great
but
certainly
not
a
session
type
beer
drinkability
decent
drinkability
drinks
light
for
such
a
high
abv
its
so
delicious
so
id
drink
it
anytime
cheers
overall
a
staple
from
the
stone
brewery
with
good
reason
this
brew
has
it
all
from
malt
to
hop
youre
not
worthy
pours
a
deep
majestic
copper
with
a
nice
tan
head
that
laced
thickly
down
the
sides
of
the
glass
smell
is
strong
piny
sticky
hoppy
resiny
malty
yeasty
clean
refined
wonderful
taste
is
very
bitter
and
very
balanced
the
bready
malts
are
right
there
on
the
tails
of
the
hops
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
substantial
and
drinkability
is
good
this
is
a
profound
beer
that
lives
up
to
all
the
hoopla
and
the
essay
on
the
bottle
is
an
arrogant
call
to
arms
for
all
craft
brew
fans
im
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
from
stone
cant
wait
till
they
come
to
louisiana
and
i
can
enjoy
this
more
often
drinkability
quite
drinkable
indeed
i
had
a
pint
of
this
and
was
going
to
get
another
but
have
been
wanting
to
try
sa
octoberfest
on
tap
so
i
held
out
overall
quite
nice
and
better
than
i
was
expecting
seeing
as
i
hold
the
stone
oaked
ab
so
highly
drinkability
definitely
a
beer
i
would
have
again
and
it
is
no
wonder
that
i
have
heard
so
much
about
this
beer
from
both
ba
users
and
friends
of
mine
who
enjoy
good
brews
if
you
havent
tried
this
yet
do
it
immediately
i
feel
stupid
for
not
buying
this
one
sooner
you
are
not
worthy
indeed
d
moderate
though
enjoyable
this
beer
grabs
you
by
the
throat
and
demands
to
be
enjoyed
at
7
its
not
the
strongest
one
youll
have
but
the
flavors
are
so
intense
you
have
no
choice
but
to
bow
down
and
drink
it
at
a
slow
pace
a
worldclass
brew
notes
though
i
am
thoroughly
impressed
with
the
caramelbrown
sugar
malt
flavours
in
the
presence
of
this
wonderful
hop
onslaught
the
alcohol
is
a
bit
too
pronounced
affecting
the
drinkability
and
taste
as
the
beer
warms
so
drink
it
fairly
cold
delicious
but
a
bit
too
hoppy
for
me
personally
a
must
try
for
all
but
will
appeal
to
hop
heads
more
than
others
not
to
say
this
beer
is
especially
hoppy
there
are
much
hoppier
beers
but
it
does
make
the
hop
presence
known
drinkability
i
first
reviewed
this
beer
on
4192008
at
that
point
i
hated
hoppy
andor
bitter
beers
that
has
really
changed
and
now
i
love
them
so
while
back
then
i
said
this
beer
was
too
bitter
for
my
taste
now
i
think
its
just
right
drinkability
i
could
definitely
have
a
few
more
of
these
at
7
2
abv
this
isnt
going
to
go
quietly
though
i
think
this
beer
would
be
and
outstanding
complement
to
strongly
flavored
foods
its
strong
and
interesting
character
could
stand
up
to
any
spicy
or
rich
food
d
okay
but
a
bit
too
strong
to
drink
much
of
in
a
night
t
wow
so
much
hop
in
such
a
good
way
great
lacing
its
got
a
wonderful
creamy
feel
to
it
the
bitter
at
the
end
slightly
stands
out
more
than
the
boldness
at
the
beginning
and
the
middle
of
the
drink
definitely
stimulates
the
mouth
as
it
claws
its
way
down
your
palate
with
a
hoppy
kick
at
the
end
definitely
a
great
session
beer
for
hopheads
drink
this
beer
everyday
and
youll
be
satisdied
for
the
rest
of
your
days
deep
and
complex
without
being
overwhelmingly
heavy
great
oak
and
spice
mix
but
subtle
enough
not
to
be
overwhleming
this
has
become
my
favorite
beer
as
it
works
on
wintery
cold
nights
and
ive
even
stretched
it
to
be
drinkable
during
water
volleyball
in
103
degree
temperature
without
feeling
too
heavy
or
out
of
place
the
marketing
is
brilliant
and
is
always
a
conversation
starter
drinkability
this
beer
dares
you
to
drink
it
it
tells
you
wont
like
it
part
of
its
arrogance
is
that
it
is
a
fantastic
beer
it
has
some
complexity
but
its
not
too
much
to
take
it
arrogant
bastard
has
a
huge
character
it
may
tell
you
that
youre
not
worthy
and
you
may
not
be
but
drink
it
anyway
youll
love
it
the
taste
is
slightly
boozy
for
its
7
2abv
but
also
really
malty
an
awesome
strong
ale
its
got
a
lot
of
complexity
to
it
that
comes
out
more
and
more
with
each
sip
looking
forward
to
comparing
this
to
the
oaked
version
the
original
dark
hoppy
ale
from
stone
the
first
of
several
every
time
i
drink
this
beer
i
taste
different
things
and
no
my
lips
are
not
moving
as
i
write
this
but
my
mouth
is
watering
at
the
thought
of
second
bottle
i
still
have
meidum
bodied
fairly
smooth
drinkability
is
a
little
hard
to
rate
for
this
one
its
gotta
be
a
matter
of
how
accustomed
you
are
to
this
kind
of
stuff
ive
given
tastes
to
the
socalled
fizzy
yellow
beer
drinkers
described
on
the
label
and
they
werent
too
thrilled
but
personally
i
love
this
stuff
so
if
youve
ever
had
anything
even
slightly
on
the
extreme
side
this
shouldnt
be
too
overwhelming
definitely
a
keeper
in
my
book
d
delicious
and
will
become
a
staple
im
not
sure
how
i
would
follow
this
one
up
on
a
night
of
heavy
beer
tasting
as
it
definitely
does
a
number
on
the
taste
buds
but
i
suppose
having
to
stick
with
this
through
a
night
isnt
necessarily
a
bad
thing
d
it
is
heavy
and
very
bitter
sumwhat
filling
no
hint
of
the
alc
it
gets
away
from
me
because
the
taste
is
excellent
bow
down
to
the
gargoyle
that
protects
this
beer
d
not
quite
as
arrogant
as
i
expected
yes
its
hoppy
and
decidedly
unbalanced
but
its
a
lot
more
drinkable
than
the
name
or
the
description
on
the
back
of
the
bottle
suggests
i
consider
this
beer
to
be
the
staple
of
an
american
strong
ale
it
reminds
be
of
a
fantastic
american
ipa
that
was
taken
to
the
next
level
try
this
you
wont
be
disappointed
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
well
balanced
and
delicious
there
is
a
lot
of
flavor
here
and
i
like
that
this
beer
is
not
completely
overpowered
by
big
hoppy
overload
the
flavor
holds
up
and
the
beer
is
quite
drinkable
its
hard
for
me
to
rate
drinkability
most
beers
with
this
much
flavor
tend
to
have
a
lot
more
alcohol
the
huge
amount
of
bitter
hops
and
malts
might
hinder
the
drinkability
but
im
drinking
it
slow
mostly
to
make
this
experience
last
longer
o
awesome
go
to
for
a
strong
american
ale
i
like
to
keep
a
few
bottles
to
age
a
bit
if
i
want
a
more
subdued
hop
character
its
a
perfect
hop
fix
when
fresh
a
cornerstone
of
any
beer
fridge
d
this
was
a
nice
malt
profiled
beer
could
drink
a
few
in
a
sitting
kicks
ass
d
this
is
the
first
beer
from
the
acclaimed
stone
brewery
that
i
have
had
the
chance
to
try
and
the
hype
is
justified
this
ales
bittersweet
profile
of
flavours
provides
a
beautifully
balanced
beer
with
just
enough
kick
to
make
you
realise
that
you
are
drinking
a
strong
ale
thankfully
certain
shops
and
bars
in
the
uk
are
catching
on
to
the
stone
range
of
beers
and
this
is
definitely
something
i
will
be
taking
advantage
of
in
the
future
pours
a
nice
amber
brown
color
with
a
fluffy
white
head
and
decent
lacing
the
smell
is
of
a
strong
malt
backbone
with
toffee
notes
and
an
overlayer
of
floral
and
pine
hops
the
taste
is
of
malt
backbone
but
a
bitter
hop
bite
is
present
and
big
on
the
back
end
a
floral
hop
taste
but
it
is
slightly
too
bitter
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
with
a
smooth
and
light
carbonation
feel
the
drinkability
isnt
as
high
as
some
in
the
class
the
bitter
bite
is
not
in
a
hop
enjoyable
way
mouthfeel
is
heavy
smooth
and
not
too
bubbly
despite
the
grand
head
of
foam
that
sticks
to
this
beer
a
bomber
of
this
beer
is
a
nice
treat
but
i
wouldnt
want
to
have
much
more
of
it
its
more
like
an
ipa
than
any
other
style
but
it
doesnt
take
on
the
role
of
a
big
session
beer
like
a
lot
of
the
ipas
do
overall
a
very
well
balanced
yet
complex
beer
this
ale
was
way
way
way
too
hoppy
for
my
tastes
evidently
or
according
to
the
packaging
this
is
because
i
am
a
giant
moron
and
a
sissy
when
it
comes
to
beer
i
know
im
probably
taking
the
damn
label
waaaay
too
seriously
but
in
my
eyes
if
you
put
statements
like
that
on
your
bottle
your
beer
sure
as
hell
better
deliver
and
arrogant
bastard
simply
did
not
deliver
it
reminded
me
of
the
compressed
pellet
of
hops
i
tasted
when
i
toured
the
anheiserbusch
brewery
in
st
louis
i
had
some
other
arrogant
bastard
beers
on
my
totry
list
but
i
will
cross
them
off
unless
someone
wants
to
throw
a
bottle
my
way
for
free
in
the
end
its
a
good
beer
and
its
a
beer
that
puts
some
hair
on
the
chest
just
like
whiskey
or
a
bj
i
liked
this
a
lot
while
i
wouldnt
say
it
necessarily
stands
heads
and
shoulders
above
the
crowd
it
is
definitely
in
an
upper
tier
of
beers
and
im
very
pleased
to
try
this
again
this
bastard
is
bitchin
got
this
in
a
22
oz
bottle
from
my
neighborhood
liquor
store
it
poured
a
deep
red
brown
with
a
twofinger
head
wonderful
citrusy
hop
aroma
has
an
initial
hop
bite
followed
by
a
sweet
carmel
malt
flavor
though
this
beer
is
strong
its
medium
body
makes
for
smooth
drinking
this
is
not
only
my
favorite
american
strong
ale
it
is
my
favorite
beer
period
d
delicious
a
fitting
name
and
well
crafted
beer
notes
this
is
a
very
very
good
beer
in
my
top
five
easily
it
might
not
be
something
a
novice
beer
drinker
would
take
to
easily
but
thats
simply
because
they
arent
worthy
yet
pours
a
beautiful
dark
amber
color
with
a
foamy
tan
3
finger
head
pine
hops
and
caramel
malt
are
the
most
dominant
flavors
same
as
with
the
bottle
the
tap
version
is
sweeter
than
the
bottle
the
aroma
is
the
same
but
not
quite
as
strong
on
tap
most
likely
due
to
the
cold
serving
temp
as
the
beer
warms
the
flavor
and
aroma
come
through
nicely
smooth
creamy
medium
bodied
and
very
drinkable
overalllives
up
to
the
hype
a
great
beer
above
the
level
of
others
i
enjoyed
the
complexity
and
was
really
able
to
savor
it
great
great
job
d
at
first
it
seemed
a
little
low
on
the
hops
and
the
drinkability
suffered
but
once
the
bitterness
kicked
in
it
becomes
much
easier
to
drink
i
found
myself
reaching
for
this
beer
quite
often
d
i
have
half
of
a
22
oz
bottle
while
i
shared
the
rest
with
my
brother
a
good
beer
to
sip
and
talk
about
but
definitely
not
anywhere
on
my
top
list
had
this
one
the
other
day
after
work
poured
an
amber
color
with
caramel
head
that
left
plenty
of
lacing
smelled
of
pine
hops
malt
and
fruit
tasted
like
pine
hops
and
malt
smooth
but
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
and
a
little
bit
fizzy
simply
put
this
is
a
good
beer
d
i
feel
the
22oz
bomber
is
quite
appropriate
in
terms
of
drinkability
this
is
not
a
beer
id
like
to
drink
more
than
22oz
of
throughout
a
session
it
was
not
bad
by
any
means
but
definitely
not
a
top
ten
overall
this
is
a
winner
in
my
book
im
not
a
hop
head
by
any
means
but
if
this
the
gateway
to
bigger
and
stronger
hop
flavors
the
door
has
been
kicked
wide
open
my
friends
md
very
thick
and
full
bodied
goes
down
smooth
i
was
expecting
a
slight
bite
with
the
abv
being
7
2
i
could
see
this
being
a
session
beer
without
a
doubt
i
love
this
stuff
but
i
still
like
the
oaked
version
a
tiny
bit
better
pours
a
very
nice
auburn
color
dark
amber
with
lacing
white
head
there
is
a
lot
of
hop
presence
in
the
aroma
and
flavor
a
sort
of
fruity
hop
but
not
to
any
extent
where
its
overpowering
a
very
nice
balance
with
the
malt
as
well
caramel
and
molasseslike
characters
from
the
malt
are
just
behind
the
hop
to
give
a
warming
full
flavor
mouth
is
very
nice
full
but
not
chewy
its
got
a
light
feel
for
the
robust
flavor
and
full
body
perhaps
not
one
of
the
best
but
very
very
good
i
had
this
for
the
first
time
a
very
long
time
ago
before
being
introduced
to
many
other
beers
and
styles
since
then
i
had
tried
double
bastard
and
oaked
ab
but
hadnt
come
back
to
the
normal
version
certainly
a
pleasure
d
its
fucking
good
a
great
sipper
something
new
and
a
reliving
of
the
previous
sip
developing
and
revealing
and
reconfirming
with
each
sip
you
cant
beat
the
original
this
is
really
something
special
d
not
sure
if
i
could
drink
a
lot
but
the
drink
is
good
md
due
to
successful
bottling
the
palate
is
really
fresh
and
helps
to
lift
the
weight
by
a
good
margin
with
only
the
necessary
dose
of
soft
carbonation
the
flavour
profile
is
balanced
deep
yet
overall
surprisingly
approachable
i
find
myself
in
deep
thought
about
the
structure
of
this
ale
and
blissful
imagination
of
how
it
might
have
tasted
on
the
caskconditioned
form
truly
a
wellhopped
premium
bitter
like
this
this
is
how
i
appreciate
this
ale
regardless
of
any
selfacclaimed
beer
style
imposed
here
or
by
stone
which
it
hasnt
shouldnt
be
an
arrogant
bastard
in
any
sense
frankly
ive
never
been
able
to
grasp
the
humour
or
pretentiousness
of
stones
beernaming
strategy
on
top
of
lines
and
lines
of
unnecessaryredundantquite
uninformative
explanation
on
the
back
label
for
many
ales
they
bottle
which
is
quite
a
failure
but
i
loyally
love
their
beers
this
ab
is
firmly
on
my
top
3
from
this
brewery
so
far
without
a
doubt
being
this
drinkable
and
approachable
i
almost
feel
i
can
stick
to
this
ale
the
whole
night
whew
i
made
it
how
many
times
ive
started
to
review
this
beer
when
the
7
2
caught
up
with
me
d
a
very
interesting
complex
and
sophisticated
brew
indeed
one
id
definitely
enjoy
again
on
occasion
poured
from
a
22
oz
bottle
into
a
tall
pint
glass
two
fingers
of
white
foam
above
a
golden
amber
clear
ale
smells
like
malt
and
a
hint
of
hops
tastes
of
roasted
barley
chocolate
coffee
the
mouthfeel
is
good
but
not
overwhelming
with
a
good
long
finish
very
drinkable
despite
the
you
arent
worthy
slogan
d
definitely
drinkable
the
bomber
size
is
perfect
for
this
beer
just
awesome
d
could
have
another
easy
sipper
with
a
tasty
dinner
quite
a
nice
treat
glad
it
is
widely
available
here
youre
not
worthy
d
at
over
7
abv
and
with
a
full
array
of
ale
flavors
this
brew
is
great
to
have
on
its
own
if
youre
willing
to
deal
with
the
dizzying
flavor
profiles
and
the
imminent
hangover
a
great
ale
but
probably
not
for
the
uninitiated
this
is
the
beer
that
introduced
me
to
the
appreciation
of
good
craft
beer
ive
tried
many
others
but
i
always
come
back
to
this
one
and
i
am
never
disappointed
its
a
great
beer
year
round
with
all
kinds
of
food
excellent
overall
if
you
havent
tried
this
then
what
the
heck
are
you
waiting
for
poured
beer
into
glass
color
was
very
good
the
odour
was
very
nice
it
implied
that
there
would
be
a
hoppy
bite
to
it
however
when
i
drank
it
the
hops
were
not
really
overtly
there
there
beer
had
a
smooth
finish
to
it
and
definitely
tasted
good
i
had
it
in
a
comparison
to
the
oaked
arrogant
bastard
i
found
this
beer
to
be
better
than
the
oaked
arrogant
bastard
but
that
just
may
be
a
taste
preference
drinkability
usually
a
bomber
is
enough
for
me
and
it
drinks
a
little
slower
than
some
of
my
favorite
ipas
but
it
definitely
is
consistent
and
tasty
throughout
and
doesnt
ever
get
too
difficult
to
drink
id
imagine
most
every
good
beer
drinker
out
there
has
had
this
due
to
stones
fantastic
distribution
scheme
and
power
but
if
not
its
certainly
a
great
example
of
the
american
strong
ale
pours
with
a
big
tan
head
the
beer
is
ruby
brown
in
color
smells
sweet
citric
alcoholy
almost
no
carbonation
from
the
first
sip
the
alcohol
makes
its
presence
known
bitter
throughout
with
a
nuttybitter
slightly
astringent
aftertaste
which
really
lingers
a
faint
mustiness
can
be
tasted
which
seems
odd
and
out
of
place
a
real
hoppy
kick
in
the
crotch
i
wanted
to
like
this
beer
more
and
i
consider
myself
a
hophead
but
it
was
a
little
too
bitterastringent
without
enough
balancing
maltiness
for
me
will
love
to
try
the
double
and
the
oaked
this
beer
is
exactly
what
it
advertises
it
packs
a
punch
not
at
all
ordinary
it
pours
a
light
cloudy
brown
the
smell
is
complex
with
hops
and
malt
present
once
you
take
a
sip
and
it
hits
your
belly
you
have
to
drink
the
rest
it
has
a
strong
hop
taste
but
finishes
refreshing
and
has
a
luring
aftertaste
unless
you
appreciate
finer
tastes
youre
not
worthytm
from
the
22
fl
oz
bottle
with
no
marked
lot
code
or
expiration
date
sampled
on
july
2
2009
the
pour
was
anice
looking
amber
brown
with
a
significant
supply
of
frothy
beige
head
that
filled
up
a
quarter
of
the
pint
glass
it
gave
me
a
foam
moustache
the
aroma
was
a
kind
of
floral
malt
mixture
which
i
know
does
not
make
a
lot
of
sense
but
that
is
how
i
define
it
nice
though
the
taste
had
a
nice
balance
of
hops
which
countered
the
7
abv
which
i
barely
even
noticed
no
wonder
everyone
lies
this
one
d
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
brew
that
could
very
easily
be
confused
as
a
session
brew
the
7
2
sneaks
up
on
you
as
it
is
so
deep
and
enjoyable
that
youll
drink
it
more
quickly
than
you
should
i
would
drink
this
brew
with
good
bbq
a
burger
a
wellaged
gouda
or
mexican
food
as
good
as
it
gets
for
a
big
american
ale
i
was
really
looking
forward
to
this
beer
as
i
had
heard
so
much
about
it
let
me
tell
you
it
didnt
dissappoint
everything
about
this
beer
delivers
from
the
excellent
deep
coloring
to
the
great
head
of
foam
to
the
complex
series
of
flavors
every
sip
brought
a
new
nuance
of
flavor
that
kept
me
wanting
more
the
only
drawback
to
the
beer
is
that
it
is
slightly
heavy
to
be
a
session
beer
but
it
is
definately
the
first
beer
i
will
grab
when
i
start
off
the
night
drinks
incredibly
smoothly
and
is
very
refreshing
zero
bite
here
i
can
drink
this
aged
and
fresh
a
very
versatile
beer
from
stone
that
never
disapoints
thick
toffee
colored
head
with
a
little
lacing
nice
dark
color
with
bold
smell
taste
starts
as
a
slight
bitter
coffee
taste
that
turns
an
almost
sweet
finish
after
the
beer
breathes
for
awhile
other
spices
start
to
develop
a
complex
beer
that
is
up
at
the
top
of
my
list
for
sure
d
it
is
drinkable
i
definately
wouldnt
session
this
bad
boy
i
think
id
be
on
my
ass
the
cool
bottle
doesnt
lie
its
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
but
really
great
none
the
less
drinkability
its
very
drinkable
however
i
choose
not
to
drink
it
everyday
i
save
it
as
a
special
occasion
beer
because
every
time
ive
had
this
beer
its
been
memorable
i
know
american
strong
ale
is
a
catchall
but
this
one
seems
halfway
between
an
ipa
and
an
american
barleywine
also
somewhat
reminds
me
of
furious
excellent
beer
that
you
can
enjoy
anytime
a
true
stone
drink
this
i
cant
wait
to
grab
a
bottle
as
i
think
a
bottle
pour
will
make
for
a
stronger
bouquet
and
open
this
one
up
a
lot
drinkability
the
beer
that
got
me
hooked
on
craft
beer
years
ago
is
still
one
of
my
favorite
ales
to
sit
around
and
drink
in
cold
or
warm
weather
well
this
was
my
first
bastard
and
it
was
pretty
decent
i
am
now
much
more
interested
in
getting
the
oak
aged
bastard
d
a
great
beer
but
i
would
not
call
it
very
drinkable
something
id
recommend
trying
however
this
is
a
great
beer
i
could
enjoy
several
in
a
session
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
im
really
happy
that
i
went
way
out
of
my
way
to
grab
this
when
i
had
the
chance
i
definitely
be
doing
my
best
to
get
ahold
of
another
one
when
im
in
a
stonefriendly
area
arrogant
bastard
the
redish
appearance
almost
makes
you
think
that
you
are
going
to
drink
unfermented
carbonated
wort
but
on
the
first
sip
you
realize
that
you
are
drinking
an
arogant
bastard
of
a
beer
d
very
tasty
drinkable
offering
full
flavored
and
nicely
balanced
definitely
one
i
will
return
to
again
d
not
very
drinkable
ok
for
a
big
beer
hop
heads
might
disagree
this
was
my
first
stone
beer
and
it
very
quickly
became
one
of
my
top
5
favorite
beers
poured
the
bottle
into
an
arrogant
bastard
glass
poures
a
wonderful
dark
red
color
with
a
thick
white
head
the
beer
is
all
about
the
hops
mixed
perfectly
with
hints
of
carmal
and
vanilla
wow
what
a
great
tasting
beer
the
pine
and
citrus
keep
coming
in
and
out
throughout
lots
of
malts
to
back
the
huge
amount
of
hops
nice
long
hoppy
bitter
finish
great
beer
only
problem
is
two
bomber
is
enough
for
me
although
i
want
to
keep
drinking
liquid
gold
pours
a
copperredish
brown
has
a
nice
off
white
that
gets
about
12
fingers
thick
in
these
glasses
but
lasts
a
while
leaves
decent
lace
smells
hoppy
almost
similar
to
the
ipa
hits
of
citrus
and
caramel
almost
if
they
mixed
the
ipa
with
the
stout
but
not
as
strong
in
either
direction
its
a
strong
flavor
but
not
overwhelming
drink
ability
is
also
good
alcohol
isnt
very
present
so
it
is
semi
session
able
but
very
flavorful
over
all
this
is
a
great
beer
and
always
a
reliable
choice
great
brew
aroma
is
strong
hops
taste
is
very
hoppy
with
strong
hop
bitterness
and
spice
and
a
background
of
malts
the
big
flavors
stay
in
your
mouth
while
i
wouldnt
exactly
call
this
easy
drinking
i
could
definitely
drink
a
few
of
these
d
the
balance
of
bitter
and
sweet
really
brings
out
some
complex
flavors
in
this
guy
the
alcohol
is
hard
to
find
amidst
the
bittersweetness
but
it
could
sneak
up
on
you
after
a
few
but
i
definitely
wouldnt
mind
having
23
of
these
no
problem
this
beer
is
a
flavor
sensation
its
sweet
bitter
and
musty
in
a
way
to
put
hair
on
the
bottom
of
your
feet
such
a
complex
array
of
flavors
enough
to
label
this
as
brewing
genius
drinkabilityfinal
thoughts
i
couldnt
wait
to
put
down
a
review
on
this
one
this
beer
is
intense
pungent
in
your
face
and
leaves
you
thinking
about
what
you
thought
was
a
good
beer
i
absolutely
loved
everything
about
this
beer
especially
the
flavor
the
outstanding
body
i
got
to
say
that
im
not
big
on
the
alcohol
burn
of
these
stronger
brews
but
im
willing
to
over
look
that
because
this
is
just
to
good
i
could
have
a
couple
pints
of
this
stuff
when
the
day
is
done
and
im
ready
to
just
unwind
and
let
the
fruity
pungent
hops
flood
my
brain
highly
recommended
cheers
the
carbonation
finds
a
nice
middle
ground
not
particularly
prickly
nor
giving
way
to
too
much
creaminess
a
full
but
not
particularly
heavy
feel
pours
a
ruby
brown
color
with
a
very
good
head
for
a
strong
ale
the
head
sticks
around
and
helps
with
the
aroma
as
much
as
it
can
the
aroma
is
pretty
weak
even
when
compared
to
other
strong
ales
the
smell
is
of
a
mild
fruit
that
seems
to
have
been
toned
down
the
taste
was
good
and
refreshing
brew
is
of
a
low
body
and
i
would
say
drinkability
is
good
as
the
alcohol
does
not
hit
you
right
away
d
can
only
drink
a
few
of
these
at
a
time
but
definitely
one
to
have
again
i
love
reading
the
label
i
aint
ever
going
back
to
tasteless
fizzy
yellow
beer
poured
from
bomber
dark
mahogany
color
profile
with
hints
of
caramel
spice
copper
on
the
nose
superb
strong
ale
that
drinks
like
a
hybrid
ipa
esb
porter
notes
of
coffee
hops
and
malt
this
is
always
a
good
choice
for
a
full
flavored
beer
and
goes
well
with
heavy
food
this
beer
pours
a
gorgeous
deep
dark
clear
amberred
served
without
much
of
a
head
to
it
but
what
was
there
retained
quite
well
nice
sticky
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
nose
is
surprisingly
more
on
the
hoppy
side
citrus
hops
some
pine
but
nicely
blended
with
caramel
malts
taste
is
outstanding
starts
of
with
a
big
citrusy
hop
bite
then
leading
in
to
darker
malts
caramel
malts
and
finishes
with
a
slightly
piney
hop
bite
this
is
an
extremely
well
balanced
beer
that
has
big
hop
and
malt
presence
but
blends
so
well
while
moving
in
to
the
next
flavor
mouthfeel
is
medium
body
low
carbonation
which
works
very
well
for
this
beer
very
smooth
almost
creamy
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
beer
love
reading
the
back
everytime
i
have
this
beer
d
i
could
drink
this
at
any
time
but
you
have
to
watch
out
too
many
and
you
might
become
the
arrogant
bastard
good
stuff
d
very
drinkable
but
you
should
keep
in
mind
that
this
beer
is
best
served
by
slower
drinking
this
beer
is
bitter
from
the
start
to
the
finish
of
each
sip
like
i
said
above
simply
awesome
d
very
nice
for
a
7er
d
goes
down
fairly
easy
but
i
dont
know
if
i
would
actually
search
for
this
beer
to
purchase
it
again
i
think
i
like
the
boldrobust
flavor
of
double
bastard
more
than
this
but
i
think
i
like
this
as
an
overall
drink
morejust
more
enjoyable
i
guess
definitely
a
beer
to
consider
when
making
a
selection
mouthfeel
is
great
one
this
one
not
too
heavy
nor
light
perfect
for
sipping
and
savoring
or
nice
big
gulps
if
so
inclined
carbonation
is
to
a
minumum
which
helps
with
the
swilling
high
scores
in
this
area
d
pretty
darn
drinkable
i
would
love
to
try
it
oak
aged
this
beer
has
been
a
bastard
to
my
taste
buds
its
teased
them
confused
them
and
in
the
end
made
sweet
tender
love
to
them
but
yeah
id
do
it
again
if
you
cant
handle
ipas
dont
bother
with
this
but
if
you
want
to
spend
10
for
a
good
time
pick
yourself
up
a
bottle
of
arrogant
bastard
also
complements
to
stone
on
a
great
name
as
well
as
their
painted
labels
pours
out
a
deep
ruby
color
with
some
notes
of
brown
a
massive
offwhiteyellow
head
forms
that
clings
up
and
down
the
glass
making
a
very
nice
looking
drink
i
can
smell
the
hops
from
a
distance
kind
of
fruity
and
there
are
even
some
sweet
bready
caramelly
malts
in
there
overall
a
very
nice
mix
of
smells
almost
straightforward
and
sort
of
wavers
between
bold
and
subdued
i
like
it
the
flavor
comes
up
kind
of
like
the
smell
not
a
harsh
bitterness
but
theres
a
good
kick
also
not
a
huge
amount
of
hop
flavor
i
get
some
spiciness
though
like
mint
almost
in
the
finish
though
i
know
clearly
that
quite
a
bit
of
hops
were
used
in
here
the
maltiness
shines
through
pleasantly
biscuity
kind
of
sweet
overall
the
taste
is
very
nice
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
bit
disappointing
when
compared
to
the
rest
of
this
beer
mine
seems
a
little
watery
kind
of
clingy
and
theres
an
odd
burn
i
dont
think
its
alcohol
related
as
it
goes
down
this
one
drinks
pretty
well
i
mean
its
a
wellexecuted
beer
an
old
favorite
of
mine
which
im
finally
getting
around
to
reviewing
and
i
can
say
that
i
will
probably
buy
more
in
the
future
recommended
to
all
i
wondered
how
easy
this
would
be
to
drink
no
problem
there
went
down
very
easy
very
very
good
beer
this
is
an
outstanding
beer
i
want
more
mouthfeel
is
slightly
syrupy
good
dry
aftertaste
poured
a
light
amber
red
good
sticky
off
white
head
that
also
had
a
great
taste
smell
is
very
hoppy
also
piney
with
a
hint
of
citrus
taste
is
very
smooth
nice
bite
of
hops
and
pine
with
a
slight
metalic
feel
in
the
mouth
a
little
bit
of
the
bitter
stays
on
the
tongue
nice
drinkibility
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
kind
of
surprising
given
the
name
but
easily
one
of
the
best
of
this
style
all
in
all
this
is
a
very
drinkable
brew
would
love
a
chance
to
try
this
on
tap
good
offering
ive
had
really
mixed
results
from
this
beer
the
first
bottle
of
it
that
i
had
was
absolutely
outstanding
the
second
bottle
was
also
outstanding
the
third
bottle
was
lets
say
not
so
good
okay
actually
the
third
bottle
was
really
pretty
bad
im
going
to
assume
that
i
just
had
a
bad
bottle
though
and
rate
it
from
the
first
couple
bottles
it
pours
fairly
dark
with
a
nice
piney
scent
with
a
hint
of
citrus
the
taste
is
just
about
what
you
expect
from
the
scent
hoppy
very
hoppy
with
a
nice
caramel
flavor
the
feel
is
good
and
the
drinkability
pretty
good
one
bottle
was
enough
for
me
ill
eventually
get
some
more
of
it
if
i
can
get
past
the
worry
that
ill
get
another
bad
bottle
the
bad
one
was
really
nasty
but
when
its
what
it
should
be
its
a
really
great
beer
overall
impression
my
wifes
favorite
beer
and
for
good
reason
somehow
it
manages
to
be
aggressively
malty
and
aggressively
hoppy
at
the
same
time
great
brew
one
i
like
to
have
in
the
old
beer
fridge
at
all
times
hits
thick
finishes
thick
i
dont
even
want
to
know
how
many
calories
are
in
this
beer
because
im
going
to
drink
a
lot
of
them
theres
a
hint
of
peatiness
here
ala
a
scotch
ale
but
the
alcohol
leads
you
to
a
barleywine
feel
as
well
a
lot
of
complexity
going
on
overall
a
good
offering
from
stone
it
is
certainly
not
my
favorite
from
them
it
reminded
a
lot
of
troegs
nugget
nectar
although
i
preferred
that
note
i
drank
over
a
half
and
hour
and
allowed
to
warm
to
room
temperature
the
flavor
was
enhanced
by
this
and
i
enjoyed
the
second
half
of
the
beer
immensely
a
good
but
not
great
offering
overall
this
is
one
of
the
most
popular
microbrewery
beers
out
of
san
diego
for
a
reason
great
stuff
all
around
this
was
good
overall
there
is
a
nice
balance
between
the
hops
and
malt
this
is
an
older
bottle
so
the
hops
have
faded
a
bit
still
very
good
though
another
winner
from
stone
drinkability
high
i
will
definitely
be
searching
for
more
of
stones
arrogant
series
in
the
near
future
what
a
beutyful
beer
and
well
balanced
when
pouired
you
get
a
nice
copper
color
ale
with
a
thick
head
around
two
fingers
smells
of
hops
where
great
taste
was
nice
with
lots
of
hops
it
was
smooth
but
not
a
chuggable
beer
i
really
wanted
to
enjoy
the
taste
nice
lacing
and
great
after
taste
i
loved
it
cheers
cant
wait
to
try
the
oaked
and
the
double
bastard
d
very
tasty
and
drinkable
both
the
mouth
feel
and
drink
ability
reflect
how
powerful
this
ale
is
certainly
too
flavorful
to
drink
3
or
4
pints
of
the
stuff
overall
a
good
experience
from
this
bastard
d
an
absolutely
delicious
ale
one
of
my
alltime
favorites
i
dont
like
the
name
or
the
tag
line
youre
not
worthy
but
this
beer
was
very
pleasant
d
i
found
this
to
be
good
but
not
mildblowing
perhaps
the
bottle
was
slightly
past
its
prime
i
would
like
to
sample
this
on
tap
soon
because
i
know
there
is
potential
here
with
a
name
like
arrogant
bastard
it
has
to
be
good
right
too
yummy
for
words
very
drinkable
in
flavor
and
feel
but
scarily
boozy
to
end
an
evening
early
be
very
very
careful
with
this
one
cheers
it
has
a
dark
copper
color
with
a
fair
amount
of
ruby
red
tint
to
it
the
aroma
is
sweet
spicy
and
nutty
the
taste
is
so
very
complex
with
dark
plums
caramel
spicy
and
nutty
flavors
it
also
has
some
hot
alcohol
flavors
mixed
in
with
its
great
bitterness
it
has
a
fairly
thick
body
and
is
very
complex
this
beer
poured
a
dark
copper
with
a
twofinger
tan
head
the
smell
is
a
bunch
of
different
types
of
hops
including
citrus
and
piney
with
a
thin
overlay
of
malt
the
taste
starts
off
with
some
sweet
malt
that
is
cut
pretty
quickly
by
some
citrusy
hops
followed
by
some
piney
and
floral
hops
with
a
good
balance
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
thick
with
a
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
this
is
a
good
beer
to
be
sure
but
i
think
i
may
prefer
to
subtleties
of
the
oaked
version
better
d
not
too
much
of
session
beer
but
something
that
i
like
to
enjoy
on
a
regular
basis
d
bomber
was
about
the
right
size
will
drink
again
but
not
a
session
beer
in
my
opinion
it
wont
be
hard
to
finish
the
bomber
but
i
doubt
id
want
more
right
away
that
seems
like
enough
for
a
sitting
drinkability
a
decent
ipa
one
to
try
just
for
reading
the
bottle
it
is
decidedly
more
aggressive
than
the
normal
ale
but
a
little
too
dark
and
raw
for
me
not
enough
hops
and
too
much
malts
drinkability
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
and
is
very
enjoyable
also
definitely
something
i
will
buy
again
soon
d
one
of
my
favorite
beers
to
date
would
gladly
drink
it
all
the
time
another
great
brew
from
stone
those
guys
are
amazing
d
drinks
easy
could
probably
drink
a
lot
of
this
quite
hoppy
so
the
drinkability
would
be
lower
if
that
doesnt
sound
like
a
good
thing
to
you
d
the
brew
is
incredibly
drinkable
and
a
bomber
is
the
perfect
ammount
future
outlook
another
beer
that
i
cant
believe
ive
waited
this
long
to
try
id
be
happy
to
have
this
again
drinkability
is
the
top
feature
that
absolutely
sets
this
beer
apart
in
this
style
it
is
way
way
way
too
drinkable
wow
what
a
great
ale
i
think
the
warning
on
the
label
is
correct
you
wont
be
able
to
fully
appreciate
the
complexity
of
flavors
in
this
beer
im
afraid
that
my
tastebuds
are
not
yet
sophisticated
enough
to
pick
out
every
flavor
which
overwhelmed
my
palate
but
that
doesnt
mean
i
wont
try
again
ill
look
forward
to
having
another
bomber
of
arrogant
bastard
d
the
definitive
example
of
the
american
strong
ale
style
maltier
and
more
complex
than
an
ipa
but
not
quite
big
enough
to
be
a
barleywine
needless
to
say
its
a
classic
amoung
american
craft
brews
its
not
for
beginners
though
it
takes
a
pretty
weathered
palate
to
withstand
the
flavor
assault
and
appreciate
everything
that
it
offers
d
great
beer
but
i
dont
know
how
many
i
could
possibly
have
before
it
would
be
too
much
the
finish
lasts
a
long
time
and
the
beer
is
high
in
booze
great
beer
though
ill
be
searching
it
out
again
while
very
good
at
everything
it
is
not
distinguished
at
any
one
thing
there
is
no
characteristic
that
grabs
you
by
the
collar
and
shakes
you
arrogant

great
solid
hits
of

each

its

with

then
you
get
the
medium

next
is
the
sweet

that
gives
way
to
a
bitter
kick
that
appears
and
mellows
after

im
not
a
big

fan
but
i
find
this
one
tolerable
and
i
know
its
by
design
the
whole
package
of
taste
and
smell
easily
masks
its
7

content
and
keeps
it
highly
drinkable

malty

essence

more
grapefruit
than
anything
though
this
is
an
aggressively
hopped
beer
though
more
mellow
than
i
remember
perhaps
the
bottle
is
a
bit
on
the
older
side
hops
come
forward
first
with
a
piney
taste
a
malty
sweetness
persists
in
the
middle
that
gives
way
to
a
strong
bitterness
not
quite
astringent
but
the
alcohol
is
definitely
there
mouthfeel
is
just
about
perfect
for
this
beer
well
carbonated
to
carry
the
hops
and
booze
off
the
tongue
the
beer
is
quite
coating
though
and
does
seem
to
stick
to
the
tongue
awesome
brew
highly
recommend
it
this
is
simply
one
superb
ale
pours
a
beautiful
burgundyamber
color
under
a
durable
wispy
offwhite
head
aroma
is
initially
dominated
by
the
sweet
malt
profile
lots
of
roasted
malts
caramel
and
wheat
toast
notes
are
up
front
supported
by
a
background
of
citruspine
needle
hop
aromas
mouthfeel
is
just
perfect
smooth
chewy
and
round
flavors
in
turn
are
definitely
all
about
the
hops
here
but
the
sweetness
of
the
malts
balance
things
out
very
nicely
starts
out
with
somewhat
semisweet
dark
wheat
bread
smokey
fig
flavor
but
quickly
transcends
into
a
big
crisp
and
bitter
hoppy
long
finish
it
reminded
me
a
lot
of
bigfoot
without
the
big
alcohol
kick
and
with
a
touch
more
malt
recommended
on

a
fantastic
beer
even
better
on

than
when
ive
had
it
in
the
bottle
definitely
worth
its
arrogance
drinkability
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
it
is
extremely
well
crafted
with
no
quality
being
overwhelming
i
have
reviewed
both
the
oaked
and
unoaked
versions
i
enjoyed
both
but
probably
would
rather
have
the
unoaked
myself
its
very
good
but
could
be
so
much
better
with
more
balance
not
my
favorite
from
stone
although
it
is
their
flagship
brew
contrary
to
the
opinion
written
on
the
bottle
i
found
myself
to
be
worthy
of
this
beer
i
must
be
pretty
damn
sophisticated
this
one
pours
a
deep
dark
brown
with
a
nice
head
and
has
a
nice
aroma
and
a
nice
malt
taste
with
a
huge
bitter
hop
finish
ruby
amber
colored
with
a
nice
fluffy
two
fingers
of
tan
head
that
leaves
decent
lacing
down
the
glass
smells
of
toffee
and
caramelfresh
bread
dough
and
grapefruity
hops
the
taste
starts
sweet
and
caramely
then
becomes
nice
and
hoppy
a
beautiful
combination
of
massive
flavors
that
pummel
the
palate
complexity
improves
as
it
warms
medium
heavy
mouthfeel
it
coats
your
throat
and
sticks
to
your
ribs
highly
drinkable
i
always
forget
how
good
this
stuff
really
is
very
nice
the
taste
is
a
wonderful
balance
of
overhopping
and
overmalting
that
continues
all
the
way
into
a
strong
lingering
finish
this
is
an
arrogant
bastard
of
beer
that
is
hard
not
to
love
it
is
powerful
shit
that
doesnt
need
to
offer
apologies
overall
this
is
a
well
balanced
super
hoppy
ale
that
goes
down
very
easy
really
nice
lacing
the
finish
will
keep
you
busy
it
starts
off
a
bit
sweet
then
you
notice
what
i
think
may
be
orange
peel
its
bitter
but
not
hoppy
bitter
then
the
7
2
alcohol
warms
your
mouth
drinkable
indeed
i
had
been
waiting
to
try
arrogant
bastard
until
i
developed
the
taste
for
hops
and
am
glad
that
did
this
is
a
great
beer
that
i
dont
think
i
would
have
fully
appreciated
before
im
proud
to
say
that
i
am
worthy
d
this
brew
goes
down
way
too
easy
this
is
my
first
review
and
i
just
had
to
say
something
about
this
beer
at
21
i
have
already
developed
a
bitter
taste
for
brews
im
always
searching
for
something
i
havent
tried
yet
that
will
leave
my
mouth
tingling
from
bitterness
once
i
saw
this
brew
said
youre
not
worthy
i
knew
i
had
to
try
it
poured
almost
a
brown
which
was
cloudy
with
bubbles
rising
from
the
depths
instantly
i
chilled
it
to
a
near
freezing
temperature
because
i
love
cold
brew
this
might
have
made
it
more
stronger
tasting
but
i
loved
it
i
can
barely
describe
the
taste
because
it
changes
so
much
so
fast
after
a
swallow
an
immediate
hoppy
bitterness
congregated
on
my
palate
a
fantastic
beer
and
still
as
my
pilsner
glass
sits
it
is
covered
from
top
to
bottom
in
the
thickest
lacing
ive
ever
seen
a
must
do
for
any
beer
connoisseur
a
little
boozy
but
still
on
par
for
the
style
m
this
beer
is
very
well
done
i
will
definitely
get
some
more
of
this
on
my
next
trip
to
my
local
beer
store
very
hearty
to
the
taste
strong
malt
notes
very
thick
and
earthy
has
a
nice
bright
bitter
hop
flare
to
it
does
have
a
bit
of
a
burn
from
the
alcohol
content
dont
drink
this
one
after
having
a
few
of
something
else
it
will
push
you
over
the
top
fast
leaves
the
mouth
a
bit
dry
and
with
a
barrel
aged
alcohol
aftertaste
drinkability
i
can
see
where
a
lot
of
people
would
like
this
beer
myself
however
cannot
get
over
the
overwhelming
taste
of
socks
it
had
some
high
points
aswell
like
its
full
bodied
flavor
with
complexities
if
you
look
for
them
overall
i
think
its
an
acquired
taste
as
many
beers
are
but
its
definately
a
beer
you
should
try
if
you
see
it
on
tap
just
based
on
its
uniqueness
all
in
all
a
really
awesome
brew
that
separates
the
hopheads
from
those
who
arent
ill
count
myself
in
the
former
this
was
originally
the
strongest
tasting
ale
i
ever
tried
until
the
double
bastard
pours
ruby
red
and
brown
with
a
short
offwhite
head
dense
malty
aroma
with
some
dried
fruits
and
a
boozy
undertone
big
malt
and
cascade
hop
combination
with
a
sweet
caramellike
backing
the
alcohol
is
always
in
the
forefront
slightly
wooden
and
this
isnt
the
oakaged
one
of
the
best
beers
medium
bodied
with
a
slick
but
not
quite
oily
mouthfeel
drinkability
is
great
i
almost
wish
i
wasnt
sharing
this
with
some
friends
delicious
md
the
beer
was
rich
and
full
bodied
but
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
yet
chewy
the
beer
had
a
slightly
sweet
and
bitter
finish
to
it
too
bad
i
only
had
one
that
night
very
well
done
beer
top
notch
for
the
style
d
i
could
sit
and
drink
these
all
night
delicious
d
i
like
this
beer
balanced
flavors
and
good
texture
make
me
want
more
of
this
as
mentioned
above
the
brewers
are
not
lying
when
they
say
this
is
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
dont
give
this
to
your
friend
who
you
are
trying
to
ween
off
miller
lite
cheers
d
this
is
a
pretty
intense
beer
but
as
every
word
on
the
bottle
indicates
they
were
not
trying
to
make
a
session
beer
the
hops
are
very
aggressive
and
while
the
malt
does
its
best
to
keep
up
with
them
they
dominate
the
flavor
profile
personally
i
would
prefer
less
emphasis
on
bitterness
and
more
complex
and
subtle
hop
flavor
but
that
might
also
require
less
dark
malt
to
let
the
hops
shine
through
overall
this
is
an
enjoyable
and
interesting
beer
but
there
are
better
west
coast
hopbombs
out
there
the
finish
is
lasting
make
you
want
to
drink
more
very
well
made

overall
if
you
are
looking
for
flavor
intricateness
beauty
statements
of
faith
for
micro
brews
this
is
not
your
beer
if
you
are
hoping
youll
look
like
an
asshole
buying
this
in
the
grocery
line
this
might
be
for
you
dont
waste
your
time
or
money
and
buy
something
else
and
by
all
means
dont
read
the
disclaimer
on
this
its
definitely
some
of
the
best
reverse
psychology
i
have
ever
been
a
part
of
drinkability
one
or
two
is
nice
but
im
pretty
satisfied
after
one
d
drinking
my
second
bomber
as
i
write
my
review
so
i
would
say
yes
very
drinkable
update
06

2008
had
this
again
tonight
and
its
still
as
perfectly
balanced
as
i
remember
you
really
cant
go
wrong
with
this
beer
super
hoppy
for
an
american
ale
and
super
enjoyable
for
anybody
who
enjoys
beer
overall
great
ale
looking
forward
to
my
next
reviewed
on
41908
bottle
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
small
white
head
hoppier
than
i
expected
a
blend
of
floral
citrus
and
piney
hops
but
blended
really
well
with
the
malt
base
the
first
time
i
had
this
was
early
in
my
beer
palate
development
so
it
wasnt
anything
special
to
me
especially
since
i
didnt
appreciate
hops
at
that
point
having
it
a
second
time
now
a
time
when
ipas
and
asas
are
becoming
my
new
fave
styles
i
was
quite
pleasantly
surprised
and
blown
away
by
this
beer
it
was
amazing
and
i
cant
wait
to
have
some
more
again
also
i
love
the
commercial
description
of
this
beerso
accurate

overall
my
first
ever
stone
beer
and
i
wasnt
disappointed
im
so
glad
this
stuff
has
finally
made
it
to
the
uk
definitely
recommended
d
i
did
a
doubletake
seeing
stone
on
tap
at
a
local
brewpub
its
good
to
have
them
here
arrogant
bastard
is
a
drinkable
beer
in
the
sense
that
you
could
have
one
or
two
with
dinner
beyond
that
tread
lightly
as
to
me
it
seems
to
drink
stronger
than
7
2
d
very
drinkable
and
very
nice
not
the
most
drinkable
of
brews
though
the
finish
does
beg
for
more
alcohol
makes
itself
known
a
little
as
the
beer
warms
but
overall
is
wellhidden
extremely
pleasurable
the
arrogance
is
not
unfounded

drinkability
despite
the
interesting
flavor
profile
not
sure
id
want
to
drink
this
often
the
numbing
effect
and
the
acidity
are
deterrents
but
there
is
also
something
missing
in
the
flavor
spectrum
that
could
tie
it
all
together
and
leave
a
greater
sense
of
satisfaction
taste
started
off
sweet
nice

malty

great

stone
wonderful
brew
very
drinkable
and
i
enjoy
it
so
much
d
this
is
an
excellent
brew
good
looks
good
scent
good
taste
and
good
moutfeel
combine
to
make
a
good
beer
complex
and
slightly
aggressive
alcohol
provides
a
warming
feeling
a
go
to
craft

for
all
occassions
amber

not
to

big

orange

malt
taste
is
apple
and
malt
yeasty
with
a
pine
flavor
good
tastes
like
their
ipa
and
their
pale
ale
at
the
same
time
dont
really
know
what
the
ruckus
is
all
about
particularly
compared
to
some
of
the
other
ones
expecting
some
more
richness
maybe
some
nice
caramel
and
leather
malt
would
be
nice
didnt
get
that
would
definitely
like
to
try
the
double
bastard
though
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
will
buy
it
again
full
mouthfeel
and
clean
finish
make
it
very
drinkable
d
moderate
as
good
as
the
taste
is
this
is
not
a
beer
for
hot
summer
days
for
the
winter
though
it
does
just
fine
poured
a
dark
brown
color
with
an
averaged
size
head
smells
of
molasses
piney
and
some
citrus
sweet
and
bitter
tasting
nicely
balanced
hoppy
dark
fruity
chewy
the
nose
on
the
beer
has
a
sweet
caramel
nose
to
it
with
a
bit
of
hops
in
the
background
the
malty
nose
is
pretty
solid
and
the
sweetness
comes
across
very
well
the
beer
is
poured
a
deep
ruby
red
with
a
creamy
white
head
of
about
an
inch
in
height
the
beer
looks
absolutely
awesome
exactly
how
a
strong
american
ale
should
look
like
the
beer
is
incredibly
balance
with
a
huge
bitterness
coming
through
at
the
end
but
a
sweetness
lingers
through
the
whole
tasting
there
is
a
great
complexity
of
hops
and
maltiness
that
i
cant
quite
put
my
tongue
on
its
like
the
hops
and
malts
are
fighting
for
the
forefront
of
the
flavour
but
end
up
having
a
great
compromise
i
think
i
might
have
to
check
into
chinook
hops
this
remeinds
me
of
a
beefed
up
red
ale
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
any
creamy
exactly
what
id
expect
the
ale
is
pretty
god
damn
drinkable
as
well
i
could
easily
have
another
m
pretty
sticky
on
the
palate
but
not
dry
nice
coating
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
just
add
this
glowing
review
to
all
the
others
drinkability
pretty
damn
drinkable
but
not
very
true
to
the
style
we
were
all
big
fans
of
oaked
arrogant
bastard
but
this
one
is
a
pretty
big
step
down
still
a
good
brew
that
i
would
recommend
the
aroma
is
very
hoppy
with
pine
and
grapefruit
its
also
got
plenty
of
caramel
the
appearance
is
reddish
with
a
nice
head
the
flavor
is
like
the
aroma
the
palate
is
smooth
this
is
a
good
beer
despite
the
fact
that
it
doesnt
really
have
a
weakness
there
is
not
as
much
to
write
about
this
beer
as
i
was
expecting
its
pretty
straight
forward
overall
im
a
bigger
fan
of
this
from
the
bottle
i
like
the
more
robust
hop
flavors
and
bitterness
id
like
to
try
this
ontap
again
to
see
how
much
it
varies
after
what
seems
like
forever
stomes
beers
are
finally
in
maine
arrogant
bastards
everywhere
pours
a
deep
browncopper
color
with
a
thick
head
smells
quite
hoppy
tastes
quite
hoppy
too
not
as
much
as
say
bigfoot
but
quite
hoppy
with
a
nice
malt
background
too
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
for
my
liking
but
overall
a
nice
beer
and
a
welcome
addition
to
us
here
in
true
part
of
new
england
on
draft
std
pint
the
other
reviews
paint
a
good
picture
of
what
to
expect
with
this
beer
so
im
mostly
just
posting
this
to
suggest
a
food
pairing
arrogant
bastard
is
really
excellent
with
peanut
butter
cups
specifically
trader
joes
brand
i
havent
had
it
with
reeses
but
i
imagine
that
its
also
quite
good
enjoy
d
the
great
flavor
and
feel
make
up
for
the
alcohol
in
this
one
it
was
remarkably
drinkable
d
at
first
tasting
it
lives
up
to
its
name
but
seems
to
continuously
get
smoother
with
every
sip
there
after
you
may
be
taken
aback
at
first
by
its
arrogant
nature
but
deep
down
you
will
find
this
a
boozy
dry
hopped
treat
that
gets
progressively
smoother
with
every
sip
and
will
grow
on
you
oh
arrogant
bastard
where
have
you
been
hiding
all
my
life
i
have
never
seen
stone
in
my
neck
of
the
woods
so
you
can
imagine
my
excitement
when
i
saw
this
appearance
is
something
to
behold
i
wish
i
could
give
higher
than
5
deep
deep
copper
color
over
two
finger
head
lacing
follows
it
all
the
way
down
smell
is
a
bit
weak
at
first
but
it
was
cracked
open
at
35
degrees
as
it
warms
up
a
wave
of
hops
his
as
well
as
a
bit
of
sugar
and
a
touch
of
alcohol
taste
is
great
overwhelming
hops
and
a
decent
malt
backbone
a
little
bit
of
sweetness
but
mostly
just
bitter
hops
mouthfeel
is
perfect
drinkability
for
the
style
and
hop
content
is
very
good
d
very
good
ale
looks
as
good
as
it
tastes
nice
dark
redbrown
color
fizzy
two
finger
head
great
lacing
smells
like
an
ipapale
little
darker
smelling
taste
nutty
cofee
carmel
finish
i
have
drank
this
many
times
but
this
is
the
first
time
reviewing
this
is
a
good
beer
drinkability
this
is
a
strong
hoppy
beer
that
fans
of
either
american
strong
ales
or
ipas
will
enjoy
the
kick
is
one
that
you
wont
forget
and
its
a
great
beer
to
eat
with
pasta
like
i
did
stone
has
done
it
again
giving
us
another
reason
to
praise
them
taste
is
much
like
an
ipa
to
me
lots
of
hops
but
not
as
much
grapefruit
a
hint
of
malt
very
easy
to
drink
well
crafted
beer
and
very
clean
tasting
medium
mouth
feel
but
not
a
lot
of
bite
fizzie
yellow
beer
is
for
wussies
that
says
it
all
beer
pours
a
dark
ruby
copper
hue
with
a
frothy
head
the
malts
on
the
nose
in
this
beer
are
quite
powerful
and
mask
the
smell
of
the
hop
profile
nicely
the
thick
malty
syruplike
quality
to
this
beer
makes
it
like
no
other
except
oak
aged
and
double
bastard
the
huge
malt
character
to
the
beer
balances
so
nicely
with
the
hops
that
they
are
almost
undetectable
strong
alcohol
is
masked
nicely
and
balanced
perfectly
i
want
to
pour
this
beer
on
my
ice
cream
pours
a
dark
brown
colored
body
with
a
brownish
head
that
is
big
lasting
has
a
very
bitter
hoppy
aroma
wow
sourness
in
the
mouth
very
bitter
dry
malty
sour
taste
almost
acidic
warming
i
didnt
like
this
beer
so
much
before
but
now
its
growing
on
me
mouthfeel
appropriately
full
mouthfeel
with
some
hoppy
dryness
gave
it
lower
drinkability
because
of
abv
this
is
a
very
good
beer
high
alcohol
content
in
this
one
though
i
didnt
really
detect
it
while
drinking
this
beer
d
strong
tasting
and
satisfying
this
is
a
good
beer
for
sure
but
i
might
tire
of
the
strong
flavors
in
this
one
after
a
couple
very
drinkable
despite
the
strong
presence
of
alcohol
pours
into
my
mug
with
a
tan
threefinger
head
that
dissipates
quickly
though
some
remains
all
the
way
down
to
leave
thick
lacing
down
the
glass
the
smell
is
woodsy
maybe
some
cedar
in
there
with
hints
of
fruit
berry
and
some
biscuity
notes
the
taste
is
huge
from
start
to
finish
starts
off
with
sweet
malts
moves
through
to
diacetyls
and
faint
caramel
then
hits
you
hard
with
a
hop
finish
that
goes
on
and
on
big
hits
of
grapefruit
or
tangelo
maybe
even
lemon
rind
the
hop
finish
also
makes
for
a
rather
pleasantly
dry
mouthfeel
in
the
end
though
before
that
what
strikes
me
is
the
smoothness
of
it
perfectly
carbonated
just
enough
to
fill
your
mouth
with
all
this
goodness
glad
to
find
this
fresh
from
the
keg
i
prefer
it
to
the
bottled
version
go
out
and
get
some
you
wont
regret
it
at
least
until
the
next
morning
not
as
good
as
i
was
led
to
believe
but
then
again
im
not
really
a
hophead
still
probably
the
best
hoppy
beer
ive
had
so
far
d
one
of
the
ultimate
american
ales
explosive
flavor
matched
with
surprising
drinkability
the
bottle
version
gives
more
control
of
serving
temperature
and
thus
better
exposure
of
the
depth
of
flavor
and
aroma
of
this
beer
i
would
give
this
ale
high
marks
for
drinkability
if
not
for
the
huge
hop
bite
i
love
it
and
can
drink
a
gallon
of
it
but
i
am
afraid
i
must
rate
the
style
without
regard
to
personal
preference
i
poured
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
a
standard
pint
glass
the
beer
is
a
toasted
color
of
caramel
the
head
is
thick
fluffy
and
sticky
there
are
several
layers
of
lacing
in
this
bad
boy
the
smell
is
deceptively
sweet
with
a
hint
of
alchohol
the
brew
is
smooth
this
a
very
well
balanced
beer
the
first
sip
is
sweet
and
almost
bready
then
a
wonderful
waterfall
of
alcohol
coats
the
tongue
the
finish
is
of
wonderful
aromatics
with
hints
of
pear
the
beer
has
medium
body
and
is
very
drinkable
i
think
it
would
complement
a
steak
very
nicely
nice
amber
color
with
a
tan
head
good
retention
the
nose
is
a
nice
mixture
of
subtle
sweet
malts
and
bitter
hops
taste
also
has
a
nice
collection
of
piney
and
floral
hops
over
mellow
candy
malts
medium
body
well
carbonated
classic
brew
from
stone
very
drinkable
beer
as
long
as
you
can
handle
the
alcohol
content
all
night
long
d
this
is
by
far
one
of
my
favorite
high
gravity
beers
glad
to
see
it
finally
got
restocked
d
too
drinkable
for
a
7
beer
after
2
i
took
a
walk
to
test
the
affects
ok
but
3
would
be
pushing
it
very
almost
too
hoppy
d
exceptionally
drinkable
at
least
if
youre
a
hophead
the
complex
and
agressive
flavors
are
overwhelming
and
you
can
easily
forget
this
is
a
7
2
abv
beer
until
you
try
to
stand
up
drinkability
the
last
bottle
i
had
of
this
was
a
couple
of
years
old
and
was
a
bad
experience
a
fresh
bottle
has
a
lot
more
delicate
and
citrusy
hoppiness
and
a
balanced
malt
profile
lesson
learned
about
aging
the
bastard
notes
this
one
is
a
treat
and
inspired
me
to
get
off
my
duff
as
a
longtime
lurker
and
finally
write
my
first
review
this
review
is
written
while
drinking
the
second
one
in
as
many
days
every
sip
brings
a
nuance
absolutely
is
one
of
the
best
ales
that
i
have
ever
had
drinkability
is
exceptional
would
drink
this
until
i
fell
over
if
i
had
that
much
ive
been
looking
forward
to
this
one
well
worth
the
wait
fantastic
beer
its
dark
and
heavy
and
riddled
with
flavor
beautiful
head
malty
aftertaste
the
hops
arent
overpowering
at
all
but
definitely
there
and
the
alcohol
is
hidden
well
wonderfully
blended
beer
i
finished
the
bottle
and
wanted
another
one
right
away
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
now
i
need
the
double
bastard
appearance
is
hard
to
determine
as
i
drank
it
from
the
22oz
bomber
i
got
at
heb
smell
is
topnotch
of
good
ingredients
not
pasturised
like
most
domestic
beers
and
many
imports
exceptional
taste
and
mouthfeel
i
paired
this
off
with
pizza
and
am
very
impressed
outstanding
drinkability
as
well
but
the
high
alcohol
volume
7
2
makes
it
hard
for
most
drinkers
to
have
more
than
one
or
two
in
a
session
well
worth
the
3
99
price
tag
enjoy
this
one
was
a
bit
of
a
shocker
bought
this
a
few
weeks
in
advance
waiting
for
the
right
time
to
crack
it
open
that
moment
came
and
this
was
the
supreme
beer
for
the
occassion
it
pours
a
dark
rich
brown
with
a
velvety
tan
head
it
smells
as
complex
as
it
tastes
notes
of
hops
and
strong
maltiness
but
its
also
earthy
and
somewhat
bitter
but
sweet
at
the
same
time
it
was
crazy
i
was
in
love
somehow
all
of
these
flavours
the
honey
notes
the
bitter
coffee
the
earthy
richness
and
the
bite
of
the
alcohol
all
work
together
marvelously
it
has
a
creamy
mouthfeel
that
makes
it
even
better
i
was
so
glad
i
had
this
on
reserve
and
i
look
forward
to
trying
more
from
stone
d
not
bad
not
a
session
beer
one
at
a
timemaybe
two
at
the
most
the
bitterness
really
prevented
me
from
enjoying
this
beer
praise
bacchus
that
this
great
brew
is
finally
available
in
georgia
it
pours
a
rich
semitransparent
appetizing
brown
with
a
thick
tan
finebubbled
head
aroma
is
strong
fiercely
hoppy
and
has
a
pine
undertone
flavor
is
richly
hoppy
a
hops
lovers
dream
it
is
fairly
but
not
harshly
bitter
and
has
just
a
whisper
of
sweetness
texture
is
lively
and
tingly
and
the
aftertaste
is
hoppy
and
piny
pretty
drinkable
for
what
this
beer
is
no
quarter
was
expected
and
none
was
given
a
nice
brew
for
taking
ones
time
with
im
starting
to
see
just
why
stone
has
experienced
so
much
success
and
look
forward
to
experiencing
more
from
this
brewery
thankfully
i
have
a
few
bottles
from
them
in
my
cellar
this
is
a
beer
that
was
brewed
to
satisfy
the
arrogant
bastard
within
me
and
it
does
a
great
job
of
it
highly
recommended
for
those
that
enjoy
bigger
beers
that
carry
a
substantial
hop
presence
d
good
drinkability
considering
the
alcohol
but
the
bitterness
is
a
bit
much
for
me
excellent
mesh
of
flavors
even
if
somewhat
simplistic
this
beer
pours
a
brownish
ruby
amber
with
a
frothy
tan
head
that
holds
quite
nicely
with
an
even
film
and
plenty
of
lacing
the
smell
is
of
toasted
malts
and
hops
the
taste
is
also
fantastic
its
malty
up
front
with
the
toasted
malts
and
then
it
hits
you
afterwards
with
a
huge
amount
of
flavorful
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
a
great
body
and
has
a
nice
carbonation
overall
a
great
beer
good
beer
but
malt
and
hops
are
out
of
whack
not
a
hopbomb
but
just
tons
of
onedimensional
bitter
hops
and
just
a
whimper
of
timid
but
rich
malt
d
if
you
like
beers
with
big
hoppy
flavors
give
this
one
a
shot
its
complex
vibrant
and
highly
drinkable
smells
of
citrusy
hops
grapefruit
and
sugary
malts
carrot
cake
comes
to
mind
for
some
reason
taste
is
pine
resin
with
grapefruit
peel
apples
caramel
surprisingly
balanced
given
the
reputation
as
a
hop
bomb
but
my
mouth
is
puckering
involuntarily
very
nice
medium
body
and
very
drinkable
for
the
style
drinkable
enough
though
i
wont
be
opening
another
bottle
tonight
id
say
its
as
strong
as
it
needs
to
be
though
very
pleasing
all
around
d
ive
now
had
this
ale
on
tap
in
the
bottle
and
also
the
oaked
version
i
have
to
say
that
i
really
love
this
ale
it
has
enough
oomph
to
satisfy
my
taste
for
big
beer
flavors
yet
was
balanced
and
complex
i
will
definitely
drink
a
lot
more
of
this
one
the
7
2
abv
is
not
overly
high
for
this
beer
still
only
wanted
the
one
bottle
gave
me
a
bit
of
a
stomach
ache
but
it
was
well
worth
it
d
well
finally
got
the
pleasure
of
enjoying
this
brewhaha
and
was
not
disappointed
i
liked
the
thick
malty
extreme
hoppy
combo
and
i
can
see
why
this
brew
has
created
such
a
buzz
and
almost
its
own
niche
style
i
will
gladly
grab
this
brew
again
and
being
a
big
stone
fan
cant
wait
to
try
the
double
and
oaked
versions
the
taste
of
this
ale
is
citrusy
not
a
sweet
citrus
but
a
bitter
citrus
thanks
to
the
abundant
taste
of
hops
the
first
half
of
the
bottle
was
pretty
hard
to
get
down
and
i
am
puzzled
by
the
great
reviews
of
this
brew
near
the
end
of
the
bottle
i
guess
i
have
acclimated
a
bit
to
the
bitterness
presence
of
hops
giving
leaving
me
with
a
nonsweet
citrus
only
taste
kind
of
reminds
me
of
grapefruit
i
really
havent
minded
the
presence
of
hop
flavor
in
beer
but
lately
ive
had
a
few
that
seemed
to
hopped
without
any
balance
leaving
me
with
a
bitter
taste
in
my
mouth
for
a
half
hour
after
drinking
them
this
is
one
of
those
dgood
session
beer
for
the
ba
wa
higher
tolerance
d
this
beer
lives
up
to
its
name
its
no
wimpy
beer
and
it
aint
afraid
to
show
it
at
only
7
2
abv
a
bomber
wont
leave
me
feeling
sleepy
either
d
this
beer
slides
down

easylike
and
will
sneak
up
on
you
if
you
try
to
tackle
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
a
good
beer
to
finish
the
evening
with
one
of
my
favorites
pours
a
dark
rustic
color
darker
than
i
expected
with
a
half
inch
pillowey
off
white
caramel
toned
head
with
good
lacing
smell
of
strong
hops
citrus
and
very
sweet
aromas
throughout
taste
of
initial
strong
hops
and
citrus
grapefruit
notes
finished
with
a
slight
malt
a
very
good
blend
and
combination
of
flavors
that
go
together
very
well
this
beer
is
flat
out
great
everything
blends
well
and
its
very
smooth
i
would
recommend
this
stuff
to
anyone
great
brew
pours
an
attractive
rusty
brown
with
just
a
tad
of
cloudiness
and
topped
with
a
thick
12inch
caramel
colored
head
first
sip
is
spicy
hot
with
sweet
malts
and
then
finishes
very
bitter
with
a
slight
whiskey
taste
what
really
stands
out
is
this
brews
mouthfeel
it
is
creamy
almost
bordering
on
milkshake
like
thanks
to
a
fantastic
malt
backbone
the
7

abv
is
not
well
hidden
overall
a
fantastic
beer
by

that
does
nothing
less
than

certainly
a

well

a
special
place
in
my
heart
its
one
of
the
first
brews
i
fell
in
love
with
when
i
moved
out
to
sf
i
dont
have
it
nearly
as
much
as
used
to
but
an
excellent

is
creamy

kind
of
uneven
somewhat
heavy

best
way
for
me
to
describe
this
beer
is
heavy
this
is
a
beer
that
i
think
tastes
stronger
than
its
abv
suggests
it
is
very
bitter
but
also
malty
not
sure
if
it
qualifies
as
balanced

a
4
course
meal
reminds
you
of
the
good
malt
presence
and
raw
ale
flavors
now
i
just
need
to
find
somewhere
on
the
east
coast
that
sells

from
a
bomber
into
a
pilsner
glass
though
delicious
d
i
fall
in
the
minority
on
this
beer
complex
and
beefy
yes
but
the
salty
taste
does
not
appeal
to
my
taste
buds
the
advertising
punches
above
its
weight
d
this
is
an
awesome
brew
if
the
abv
was
a
hair
lower
i
could
session
this
for
a
strong
ale
the
taste
is
great
everyone
should
give
this
beer
a
try
pours
ruby
brown
with
a
mahogany
heart
tight
compact
white
head
slides
down
to
an
atoll
around
the
glass
smell
is
piney
resiny
sap
with
some
tangerine
zest
and
backed
up
by
a
sweet
bready
caramel
malt
background
taste
is
very
refreshing
sort
of
similar
to
a
bigfoot
without
the
creamed
mouthfeel
hits
the
front
of
the
tounge
with
sweet
toasted
raisin
bread
hints
of
maple
syrup
all
quickly
balanced
out
across
the
tongue
with
a
bit
of
piney
hop
finishes
clean
and
dry
not
to
heavy
on
the
mouthfeel
refreshing
really
a
good
beer
no
matter
who
may
or
may
not
be
worthy
really
good
sipping
beer
yup
that
first
sip
is
hoppy
citrus
dry
bitterness
very
good
i
can
feel
the
warmth
of
this
one
7

nice
finish
the
malt
and
hops
blend
together
nicely
a
very
good
ale
ive
never
been
disapointed
with
stone
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
with
a
slow
pour
deep
red
brown
color
like
mahogany
foamy
off
white
1
5
inch
head
head
retained
for
a
while
lacing
down
the
whole
glass
smells
of
pine
maybe
hints
of
grapefruit
and
i
get
some
grass
not
fresh
cut
grass
but
grass
you
smell
when
your
out
in
the
field
playing
some
baseball
makes
me
think
of
my
little
league
days
nice
hop
profile
balanced
with
a
great
malt
backbone
nice
long
finish
pretty
arrogant
brew
does
a
good
job
of
ripping
through
my
tongue
but
i
am
loving
it
incredibly
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
dont
think
i
could
do
more
than
the
22
oz
bottle
at
once
this
beer
screams
to
be
paired
with
game
or
steak
imo
i
thought
this
would
be
up
there
with
the
rogue
ipa
but
it
wasnt
quite
that
good
it
was
still
more
robust
than
a
typical
ipa
and
it
had
a
good
clean
hops
flavor
with
some
malt
but
it
didnt
have
as
much
flavor
and
it
wasnt
as
wellbalanced
as
the
rogue
however
the
stone
was
deceivingly
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
considering
its
7
2
alcohol
d
a
good
beer
tends
to
slow
down
after
the
second
serving
drinkability
very
good
beer
dangerously
drinkable
will
sneak
up
on
ya
im
in
love
with
this
beer
if
stone
has
a
musician
endorsement
program
someone
please
let
me
know
because
i
would
drink
this
beer
on
stage
every
night
22oz
bottle
poured
into
a
duvel
tulip
glass
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
light
tan
head
that
turns
leaves
a
good
amount
of
lacing
around
the
glass
the
aroma
is
very
nicely
balanced
with
a
good
amount
of
malt
to
support
the
hops
the
taste
much
like
the
aroma
is
very
nicely
balanced
the
hops
definitely
holds
the
spotlight
in
this
brew
but
the
malt
holds
its
own
providing
a
very
nice
backbone
overall
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
brew
that
is
extremely
well
balanced
but
features
enough
of
a
kick
to
satisfy
any
hop
fix
if
this
were
available
here
i
would
arrogant
bastard
by
the
case
highly
recommended
md
top
notch
this
beer
had
a
great
taste
good
carbonation
and
was
very
easy
to
drink
cant
wait
for
these
guys
to
start
showing
back
up
in
tennessee
d
when
a
strong
ale
is
called
for
this
isnt
a
bad
option
at
all
this
was
actually
quite
good
in
the
long
run
i
was
not
impressed
at
first
but
the
beer
seems
to
wake
up
as
it
warms
in
the
glass
and
breaths
highly
recommend
drinkability
very
nice
good
drinking
beer
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
really
a
joy
of
a
sipper
a
rich
complex
and
satisfying
ale
almost
a
wine
in
many
ways
there
are
more
flavors
and
aromas
here
than
i
can
begin
to
count
and
my
grasp
of
the
english
language
isnt
firm
enough
to
describe
all
the
sensations
this
beer
brings
about
mouthfeel
no
noticeable
warming
feeling
from
alcohol
and
seems
to
be
a
bit
thin
very
drinkable
alcohol
aftertaste
seems
to
dissipate
after
a
few
drinks
and
the
thinness
allows
you
to
drink
it
very
easily
could
be
a
very
dangerous
beer
at
7
this
is
a
great
and
complex
beer
that
i
would
love
to
try
repeatedly
and
ontap
a
strong
offering
from
stone
d
the
flavors
are
layered
one
after
another
which
makes
me
want
to
drink
sip
after
sip
to
find
more
flavors
not
something
to
party
all
night
with
but
nice
to
have
a
bomber
while
hanging
out
alone
d
this
brew
have
a
sinister
side
but
good
poured
a
deep
redcopper
color
to
it
it
has
a
big
hop
aroma
too
very
citrusy
and
piney
these
people
must
love
using
cascade
chinook
or
perle
hops
it
has
a
slightly
heavy
body
but
is
definitely
drinkable
with
your
first
taste
you
get
the
wonderful
citrus
piney
hop
flavor
on
your
palate
and
then
it
mellows
out
and
the
bitterness
flows
through
leaving
a
nice
crisp
finish
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
to
drink
and
because
of
the
big
hop
flavor
you
dont
even
realize
it
weighs
in
at
7
2
on
tap
at
the
red
in
santa
cruz
poured
into
a
nonic
dark
ruddy
copper
in
color
with
a
thick
offwhite
head
tons
of
lacing
aroma
is
chiefly
hoppy
with
lots
of
tropical
fruitiness
and
a
big
dose
of
pine
taste
is
again
hopcentric
with
mango
and
grapefruit
chased
with
a
numbingly
epic
bitterness
malt
is
also
in
full
force
with
lots
of
caramel
and
dark
fruit
this
is
a
bona
fide
tongueraper
in
a
good
way
finish
is
long
dry
and
very
bitter
killer
beer
only
for
the
worthy
i
didnt
like
the
smell
or
the
taste
it
smelled
very
pinehoppy
and
tasted
likewise
this
is
the
second
time
that
i
have
tried
arrogant
bastard
from
the
bottle
the
first
was
prior
to
learning
about
beer
styles
and
their
characteristics
so
i
figured
that
i
should
try
it
again
maybe
it
is
better
from
the
tap
if
it
is
sold
that
way
this
is
a
brew
and
a
name
thatll
ill
remember
i
would
expect
such
a
complex
brew
to
feel
a
bit
harsh
but
its
fairly
smooth
and
leaves
a
crisp
aftertaste
making
you
want
more
i
yield
to
this
brews
arrogance
i
am
not
worthy
the
first
beer
that
i
wouldnt
be
able
to
drink
all
day
long
hopefully
i
was
worthy
of
this
one
pours
a
deep
red
with
a
medium
tan
head
smells
of
floral
hops
the
taste
is
very
malty
with
a
strong
bitterness
to
match
there
seems
to
be
not
that
much
of
a
hop
flavor
though
most
of
the
hops
shine
through
in
the
bitterness
reminds
me
of
an
english
strong
ale
with
more
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
rich
carbonation
levels
are
low
and
smooth
a
quite
drinkable
beer
that
tastes
fantastic
i
really
wish
i
could
get
this
back
in
oklahoma
d
very
drinkable
but
not
a
session
beer
i
would
not
mind
a
couple
of
them
over
an
early
spring
evening
at
home
a
bit
heavy
but
not
as
much
as
one
might
expect
given
its
heartiness
overall
a
good
recommendation
but
i
still
prefer
the
stone
ruination
ipa
if
i
had
to
choose
cheers
guess
i
got
drink
if
given
again
but
will
not
by
ever
this
is
probably
a
lot
more
drinkable
than
expected
for
the
alcohol
content
has
always
been
a
favorite
and
still
is
extremely
well
done
d
very
strong
and
distinct
beer
yet
very
drinkable
this
is
the
beer
that
turned
me
into
a
craft
beer
enthusiast
so
it
will
always
hold
a
special
place
in
my
liver
d
a
pretty
strong
ale
but
its
really
good
try
one
on
today
this
is
a
great
beer
as
most
stone
beers
that
ive
had
have
proven
to
be
the
7
2
abv
doesnt
really
show
through
much
at
all
definitely
something
that
i
try
and
always
have
on
hand
in
my
fridge
d
definitely
a
drinkable
beer
an
excellent
balance
of
hops
and
malts
the
hops
are
more
evident
in
the
beginning
but
become
much
more
balanced
out
towards
the
finish
pour
is
reddish
brown
with
a
light
head
smell
is
malty
sweetness
with
some
hops
showing
through
taste
is
sweet
but
not
overly
at
all
followed
by
a
mild
drying
hop
finish
thich
and
rich
for
the
style
while
flavors
are
somewhat
mild
actually
nice
bitterness
at
first
but
it
turned
medicinal
and
aspirin
tabletlike
a
bit
not
bad
but
wasnt
too
crazy
about
it
either
the
labels
right
not
for
beer
wimps
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
full
and
very
smooth
a
lush
and
easy
drinking
brew
not
the
best
beer
i
have
had
of
this
style
but
not
bad
either
appearence
dark
amber
almost
reddish
brown
in

drinkability
ok
this
is
a
once
in
a
while
beer
nice
thick
mouthfeel
for
some
reason
ive
just
never
appreciated
this
beer
as
much
as
i
should
i
always
find
myself
grabbing
the
oaked
version
double
bastard
or
ruination
instead
solid
pleasing
product
d
very
light
feeling
and
drinking
for
the
abv
great
beer
that
you
can
enjoy
year
round
d
you
cant
drink
these
all
night
but
i
would
definitely
drink
this
on
a
regular
basis
definitely
lives
up
to
its
warning
that
this
is
not
for
the
carbonated
macro
brew
drinkers
this
will
definitely
be
something
i
get
again
and
again
as
does
the
taste
arrogant
bastard
sends
the
message
that
it
means
business
the
caramel
is
very
pleasant
but
not
too
sweet
and
combines
with
the
fruit
very
nicely
i
was
surprised
at
the
rather
dry
aftertaste
which
doesnt
go
well
with
the
rest
in
my
humble
opinion
yet
this
is
a
very
good
and
worthy
brew
more
than
worth
trying
but
worth
its
weight
in
gravitas
this
beer
has
nerve
and
lives
up
to
its
braggadoccio
well
done
very
good
beer
a
while
back
i
had
sampled
stones
oaked
arrogant
bastard
ale
and
really
enjoyed
the
extreme
flavor
the
brewerys
original
ale
is
just
as
good
if
not
better
in
my
opinion
absolutely
amazing
darkcopper
prunecolored
appearance
with
a
gigantic
frothy
and
foamy
head
that
almost
obliterated
my
drinking
glass
smell
was
replete
with
caramel
and
bitter
hops
along
with
a
tinge
of
vanilla
strange
how
the
taste
strongly
complemented
the
aroma
with
honey
flavors
caramel
strong
hops
bitter
florals
and
slight
vanilla
the
flavor
is
truly
extreme
aggressive
and
dominating
the
strong
ale
flavored
is
extremely
loaded
with
hops
and
a
strong
taste
that
completely
dominates
the
pallate
and
doesnt
let
go
this
has
to
be
one
of
the
most
dominating
and
extreme
american
brews
definitely
not
for
the
faintofheart
really
thick
and
rich
stuff
if
you
like
stronger
fullflavored
beers
this
one
is
definitely
recommended
d
this
goes
down
so
well
very
drinkable
this
is
not
the
greatest
american
strong
ive
ever
had
but
it
is
a
gold
standard
for
the
style
solid
hearty
malty
flavor
with
a
nice
strong
kick
of
hops
really
well
balanced
and
amazingly
smooth
i
just
cant
get
enough
of
this
d
i
really
liked
this
beer
and
would
definitely
drink
it
again
it
was
full
of
flavor
which
i
drank
a
savored
slowly
i
can
see
the
alcohol
sneaking
up
on
you
after
a
few
this
is
an
awesome
beer
it
pours
a
nice
amber
color
from
the
bottle
with
a
nice
lacy
thick
tan
colored
head
the
aroma
is
of
roasted
malts
and
great
flowery
hoppy
aroma
the
taste
is
excellent
the
malts
come
through
as
the
base
and
the
hoppy
bitterness
follows
through
to
the
end
the
mouthfeel
is
excellent
and
it
is
velvety
especially
for
a
beer
of
this
gravity
the
drinkability
is
excellent
i
could
drink
alot
of
these
if
i
could
this
beer
is
awesome
pick
it
up
if
you
can
d
could
drink
several
but
wished
it
was
more
of
a
session
style
just
very
refreshing
for
a
stronger
ale
d
very
cool
beer
definitely
one
worth
trying
spur
of
the
moment
went
to
specs
and
picked
it
up
friend
liked
it
so
had
to
try
it
dark
brown
in
color
with
a
smell
that
resembles
flowers
taste
is
almost
similar
to
an
ipa
and
also
goes
down
real
smooth
overall
i
would
definately
recommend
this
beer
to
other
people
d
it
was
a
bit
over
hopped
and
bitter
for
my
taste
but
great
craftsmanship
is
hard
to
hide
this
is
a
well
put
together
brew
that
merits
great
respect
i
doubt
it
will
be
a
longterm
resident
of
my
stash
but
i
will
never
turn
it
away
from
my
lips
d
ah
i
remember
the
day
when
ab
was
too
strong
for
my
delicate
palate
now
i
find
it
smooth
balanced
and
honestly
easytodrink
i
usually
have
access
to
various
forms
of
ab
and
other
stone
special
releases
so
i
am
rarely
going
out
of
my
way
for
the
regular
old
ab
but
it
is
still
delicious
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
drinkability
is
good
this
is
my
stand
by
and
one
of
the
first
beers
that
got
me
into
craft
brewing
medium
in
body
rich
smooth
and
chewy
very
drinkable
aggressive
but
complex
and
smooth
enough
to
have
a
couple
in
a
sitting
great
beer
ill
definitely
buy
this
label
again
overall
this
is
a
quality
ale
would
definitely
recommend
tipping
this
one
back
i
was
much
impressed
with
this
stone
offering
as
it
clearly
lived
up
to
the
hype
i
really
wish
stone
distributed
here
in
missouri
but
i
guess
those
of
us
out
here
in
anheuserbusch
country
arent
worthy
ab
leaves
nothing
to
guess
it
is
big
it
is
a
beer
i
unfortunately
always
overlooktake
for
granted
i
really
should
buy
it
more
often
but
the
rational
side
of
me
always
says
the
ab
will
always
be
here
try
something
different
i
will
make
an
honest
effort
to
enjoy
it
more
often
too
often
other
beers
leave
you
wondering
what
if
the
upped
the
maltshopsalcohol
etc
ab
leaves
nothing
to
guess
that
being
said
personally
i
prefer
its
bigger
brother
d
this
beer
is
all
about
hops
quite
nice
imo
d
this
is
hurt
because
of
the
hoppy
bitterness
to
it
alcohol
also
hurts
it
as
well
but
a
beer
that
is
definately
worth
a
second
try
appearance
is
a
nice
dark
brown
almost
reddish
color
with
a
huge
three
finger
head
it
smells
great
with
a
strong
hoppy
floral
and
sweet
aroma
this
ale
is
clean
and
fresh
tasting
with
plenty
of
hops
however
there
is
less
residual
bitterness
than
in
stone
ipa
the
hoppy
freshness
is
balanced
with
some
malty
sweetness
and
hints
of
toastiness
there
is
some
fruity
perhaps
grapefruit
rind
taste
mixed
in
there
as
well
while
there
is
a
significant
hoppy
character
to
this
brew
it
is
a
delicious
beer
i
could
drink
often
there
is
no
need
to
be
intimidated
by
the
label
or
the
name
if
you
enjoy
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
or
liberty
ale
you
will
probably
like
this
one
as
well
cheers
d
the
only
thing
keeping
this
from
being
one
of
my
goto
brews
is
that
here
in
michigan
the
price
is
pretty
steep
at
4

a
pint
but
youre
definitely
paying
for
quality
i
will
definitely
be
getting
one
of
these
every
few
weeks
or
so
i
will
be
visiting
the
bastard
again
soon
i
just
might
wear
gloves
the
next
time
i
handle
the
bottle
d
pretty
good
i
really
like
this
beer
i
like
the
ipa
even
more
and
wish
stone
sold
more
of
their
stuff
in
texas
or
at
all
in
georgia
id
definitely
enjoy
this
more
often
if
i
could
buy
it
where
i
lived
get
in
ga
stone
anyway
pick
it
up
if
you
can
taste
is
strong
bitter
with
citric
hops
that
show
a
bit
rough
edges
maltiness
is
not
as
strong
as
the
smell
would
make
me
suspect
but
it
still
is
heavy
on
the
malt
the
alcohol
is
warming
and
mouthfeel
is
sweet
and
a
little
thick
i
think
this
achieves
a
nice
balance
between
maltiness
and
hops
and
is
no
doubt
quite
a
bit
bitterer
objectively
than
the
impression
it
gives
quite
drinkable
for
such
a
big
beer
i
think
the
two
strong
points
of
this
one
are
balance
and
nose
d
okay
so
complex
it
becomes
intriguing
this
is
one
elusive
beer
hiding
itself
beneath
folds
of
hop
and
bitterness
it
leaves
much
to
discover
but
will
certainly
turn
off
those
who
are
weak
of
palate
and
cannot
handle
the
intensity
pours
a
cherry
brown
with
a
lingering
massive
head
that
leaves
a
fair
amount
of
lace
on
the
way
down
nose
at
first
seemed
like
blueberries
but
calmed
down
after
a
minute
taste
is
massively
complex
and
thorough
sweet
edge
follows
a
burst
of
hop
flavor
with
a
deep
almost
oaky
presence
which
turns
into
what
i
want
to
say
is
a
slight
alcohol
presence
on
the
end
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
or
palate
this
beer
is
complex
and
lacks
mercy
for
those
who
are
immature
in
beer
this
brewery
continues
to
amaze
me
need
to
visit
it
someday
d
great
beer
i
love
this
if
you
like
this
also
try
oaked
arrogant
bastard
and
double
arrogant
bastard
taste
is
massive
hops
up
front
followed
by
more
hops
then
a
lingering
hop
aftertaste
theres
a
mild
malt
presence
that
gives
it
a
dry
quality
feels
slightly
thin
and
bubbly
i
am
not
worthy
this
is
a
very
goog
beer
and
i
wish
it
was
more
availible
in
the
upper
midwest
this
is
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
and
i
hope
to
enjoy
it
again
pours
deep
redish
copper
with
a
good
size
head
that
laces
nicely
to
the
glass
aroma
of
bready
malt
and
huge
hop
additions
interesting
mouthfeel
from
all
those
bitter
hops
taste
is
extreme
and
almost
unbalanced
but
none
the
less
very
very
delicious
just
a
side
note
this
brew
is
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
its
big
complex
very
raw
and
very
sophisticated
you
need
to
know
what
youre
getting
into
before
you
buy
it
if
you
dont
like
hops
dont
get
it
if
you
dont
like
big
brews
dont
get
if
you
dare
but
im
defiantly
going
to
get
this
one
again
drinkability
a
beer
that
has
such
a
strong
long
lasting
hop
flavor
is
not
something
you
could
drink
a
ton
of
very
tasty
and
something
i
would
drink
often
just
not
several
in
an
evening
cheers
to
ncsudo
for
the
extra
the
drinkability
is
decent
but
the
heavy
flavor
would
make
it
difficult
to
enjoy
several
of
these
d
i
would
like
to
spend
an
afternoon
with
a
number
of
these
as
i
cannot
see
tiring
of
this
great
brew
i
especially
like
how
it
changes
as
it
lowers
in
temperature
started
at
50
degrees
i
will
be
offering
to
guests
i
was
really
excited
to
try
this
after
tasting
stones
ipa
which
i
loved
22
oz
bomber
poured
into
a
pint
glass
with
a
nice
oneinch
frothy
head
color
is
a
deep
reddish
brown
smells
of
malts
hops
and
earthy
nuts
the
taste
reminds
me
of
a
strong
brown
ale
or
nut
ale
i
likened
it
to
samuel
adams
brown
ale
but
this
beer
is
much
better
the
balance
between
caramel
roasted
malts
hops
and
earthy
nuts
is
a
lot
better
great
flavor
its
followed
by
a
warming
7
2
alcohol
not
a
huge
amount
but
noticeable
overall
another
winner
from
stone
very
nice
beer
not
sure
if
its
worth
55case
but
it
is
a
high
quality
example
of
a
strong
ale
drinkability
i
could
drink
more
than
a
couple
of
these
without
getting
tired
of
it
but
then
i
would
get
tired
of
it
because
its
like
slamming
a
grapefruit
into
your
brain
to
get
you
drunk
poured
from
the
arrogant
bomber
which
is
a
treat
in
its
own
into
chalice
pours
a
richp
mahogany
brown
with
a
slightly
offwhite
head
not
a
huge
head
but
not
too
small
not
the
greatest
retention
some
lacing
smell
is
hoppy
with
some
caramel
and
some
alcohol
taste
is
great
very
complex
so
im
sure
im
missing
something
here
some
citric
notes
mainly
pineapple
with
a
touch
of
hops
and
some
sweetness
too
an
almost
chocolate
taste
as
it
goes
down
medium
to
almost
thick
mouthfeel
i
would
argue
and
a
slightly
oily
feeling
left
behind
but
its
not
necessarily
unpleasant
overall
a
good
beer
abv
is
a
little
high
but
for
the
most
part
easily
drinkable
and
a
real
treat
scott
had
this
at
moan
and
dove
ontap
a
heavy
head
with
a
dark
brown
appearance
very
heavy
on
the
malts
when
sniffed
however
it
seems
a
little
offbalanced
with
its
other
aromas
such
as
citrus
and
caramel
this
hinders
it
from
being
perfect
this
had
a
decently
bitter
taste
overall
some
sweetness
here
and
there
with
sips
high
carbonation
allows
you
to
drink
it
with
some
refreshingness
in
general
this
was
another
great
drink
from
stone
has
this
from
a
22
ounce
bomber
poured
an
attractive
reddishbrown
color
with
a
good
head
that
lasted
a
while
aroma
was
fruity
and
very
hoppy
flavor
was
also
a
bit
of
citrus
with
very
hoppy
flavor
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
mouthfeel
was
excellent
i
would
have
again
and
again
and
recommend
nice
job
stone
i
like
how
it
starts
you
off
thinking
it
will
be
sweet
all
the
way
through
than
explodes
the
bitterness
on
you
like
a
timebomb
did
not
expect
this
one
to
be
so
smooth
though
not
that
its
a
bad
thing
and
like
they
say
you
really
have
to
appreciate
what
they
were
trying
to
do
to
understand
this
so
many
people
probably
wont
like
this
beer
but
i
do
recomend
it
to
hop
lovers
and
sweet
malt
lovers
it
goes
both
ways
which
is
very
impressive
on
both
ends
translucent
medium
brown
an
initial
half
inch
of
head
that
dissipates
to
a
thin
layer
good
lacing
hoppy
aroma
that
doesnt
mask
the
rich
bready
malt
plenty
of
carbonation
a
little
swirl
of
the
glass
visibly
thickens
the
head
taste
begins
with
pine
and
citrus
that
is
follow
by
a
rich
malt
that
is
slightly
sweet
and
finishes
dry
and
bitter
this
is
a
good
ale
with
nice
balance
for
my
tastes
anyway
i
could
drink
this
all
night
there
is
always
something
new
in
each
sip
d
the
hop
finish
could
quickly
overwhelm
my
palate
but
the
malt
flavors
balance
it
well
the
bottle
says
that
many
people
may
not
like
this
beer
they
are
correct
not
a
pleasant
beer
to
drink
i
agree
in
principle
with
what
this
beer
is
trying
to
do
educate
people
on
the
difference
between
macro
lager
crap
and
big
business
but
they
failed
in
my
opinion
the
key
is
balance
there
is
just
too
much
hops
and
nothing
else
try
something
else
d
this
is
very
drinkable
except
for
the
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
i
will
probably
end
up
drinking
this
again
but
it
is
not
my
favorite
overall
great
work
from
stone
i
look
for
this
beer
whenever
i
can
but
i
cant
find
it
in
kansas
a
real
treat
indeed
overall
im
a
bit
nostalgic
about
this
beer
as
a
draft
of
this
in
california
was
really
my
introduction
to
extreme
beer
granted
its
not
that
extreme
today
but
still
a
fantastic
beer
that
is
a
joy
to
drink
the
beer
poured
dark
brown
with
hints
of
ruby
showing
there
was
a
tan
head
and
bits
of
yeast
floaties
suspended
in
my
glass
i
was
expecting
an
onrush
of
hop
flavors
but
was
surprised
that
i
initially
greeted
with
a
sweet
malt
flavor
however
the
hops
soon
dominated
the
beers
flavor
and
the
finish
was
bitter
this
beer
was
full
bodied
and
had
a
smooth
oily
mouth
feel
i
would
not
recommend
drinking
arrogant
bastard
on
a
hot
sunny
summer
day
but
for
a
chilly
autumn
afternoon
it
is
a
great
beer
the
arrogant
bastard
pours
a
deep
red
with
a
huge
foamy
head
and
aggressive
lacing
down
the
side
of
the
glass
i
didnt
see
a
freshness
date
the
smell
and
taste
were
malt
dominated
with
some
hops
on
the
side
it
had
a
in
your
face
spiciness
at
the
finish
on
the
palate
this
was
one
bastard
of
an
ale
that
i
would
recommend
d
suffers
a
bit
here
for
me
at
least
i
doubt
i
could
put
back
more
than
two
overall
a
powerful
punch
and
another
great
brew
from
stone
a
great
beer
it
pours
out
a
nice
dark
caramel
color
with
a
great
head
and
very
nice
lacing
it
has
a
wonderful
scent
not
overly
bitter
at
all
just
a
nice
clean
and
crisp
ale
aroma
a
wonderful
taste
as
well
an
excellent
balance
of
malts
and
hops
leaning
towards
the
former
with
a
nice
but
not
overpowering
hoppy
aftertaste
goes
down
fantastic
for
such
a
high
abv
beer
and
good
in
its
comparison
to
all
other
ales
an
excellent
brew
another
beautiful
beer
this
rubyish
beer
pours
real
nice
with
a
good
fingers
worth
of
head
it
smells
clean
crisp
and
hoppy
the
taste
well
lets
just
say
you
should
try
some
yourself
its
worth
your
time
if
you
cant
wait
and
need
a
spoiler
then
here
it
is
first
taste
is
slightly
sweet
and
malty
not
fruity
but
a
good
ale
flavor
this
is
what
beer
should
taste
like
from
there
the
hops
creep
up
your
tongue
and
do
a
little
dance
on
your
taste
buds
after
you
swallow
the
bitterness
of
the
hops
stays
with
you
for
a
few
moments
it
doesnt
leave
a
bad
bitter
taste
in
your
mouth
but
it
does
whet
your
appitite
for
more
this
beer
doesnt
suck
the
surprising
low
carbonation
and
not
overblown
hops
make
this
a
very
drinkable
beer
moderately
creamy
mouthfeel
poured
out
of
the
badass
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
has
a
very
nice
color
with
a
good
head
that
dissipates
fairly
quickly
this
beer
is
very
unique
but
definitely
tasty
it
certainly
lives
up
to
its
name
as
it
is
very
in
your
face
with
all
of
the
hops
i
cant
quite
put
my
finger
on
any
particular
flavor
in
the
taste
but
it
is
relatively
complex
definitely
glad
i
got
my
hands
on
this
an
excellent
brew
this
is
the
beer
that
opened
up
hoppy
beers
to
me
and
i
have
not
looked
back
the
hops
numb
the
tongue
and
i
love
it
alcohol
adds
spiciness
and
warming
but
never
gets
in
the
way
it
is
in
your
face
and
i
could
not
drink
more
than
a
bomber
in
one
sitting
i
do
like
yearold
oaked
bastard
better
than
this
but
this
is
definitely
a
staple
for
me
and
a
new
classic
beer
beer
poured
an
amber
red
color
with
a
strong
off
white
head
that
is
well
sustained
nose
is
a
pleasant
boquet
of
floral
hops
a
hint
of
what
is
about
to
hit
the
palate
taste
is
a
hint
of
caramel
malts
and
a
blast
of
those
floral
hops
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
and
very
smooth
drinkability
is
very
good
i
have
always
looked
at
this
beer
as
a
junior
version
of
the
barleywine
style
but
a
much
more
drinkable
one
definitely
worth
a
taste
im
no
wimp
i
like
spicy
foods
and
hoppy
beers
but
arrogant
bastard
is
definately
not
for
me
and
if
things
werent
good
enough
this
was
a
perfect
compliment
to
a
cannoli
a
10
pens
victory
over
the
rangers
pens
pens
pens
pens
the
bottom
line
is
that
this
is
a
wellbrewed
beer
that
is
very
arrogant
indeed
with
its
presence
i
enjoyed
it
and
suspect
that
others
who
appreciate
a
full
presence
and
hop
flavor
will
as
well
i
dont
believe
i
could
drink
these
all
night
but
im
sure
some
could
very
thick
mouthfeel
this
is
a
high
alcohal
brew
but
i
think
even
with
the
bitterness
i
could
drink
quit
of
bit
of
this
brew
chocolate
brown
mahogany
bronze
to
light
with
a
full
brown
head
sediment
floaters
good
carbonation
and
little
lace
nice
balanced
malt
and
hop
aroma
chocolate
malt
notes
and
piney
hop
aroma
tastes
much
like
it
smells
with
an
overly
bitter
finish
not
pleasantly
hoppy
full
bodied
and
creamy
with
a
harsh
bitter
finish
poured
from
a
22
oz
bottle
into
glass
a
malty
hop
aroma
some
bread
notes
as
well
taste
is
very
full
bodied
tons
of
flavors
from
hops
to
citrus
to
well
there
is
a
little
bit
of
everything
in
this
beer
great
beer
d
kind
of
strong
to
just
put
away
too
much
but
very
enjoyable
brew
i
liked
it
and
i
will
pick
some
more
up
when
i
am
back
in
the
area
that
sells
it
revised
after
having
on
cask
at
linkery
in
sd
unreal
i
really
like
this
beer
and
would
put
it
in
my
top
ten
list
the
drinkability
is
limited
only
by
the
alcohol
content
this
beer
poured
a
nice
pleasent
mahogany
brown
color
it
had
a
nice
foamy
head
that
stuck
trough
my
drinking
i
prefer
it
cold
when
it
got
warm
the
taste
sorta
got
over
powering
the
mouthfeel
was
rather
heavy
but
pleasant
it
tasted
fantastic
with
some
great
hot
wings
it
finished
a
lil
strong
for
my
taste
but
when
i
am
in
the
mood
for
a
heavier
beer
i
would
definately
go
for
this
one
one
of
the
best
out
there
if
you
love
beer
you
owe
it
to
yourself
to
try
this
heck
even
if
you
dont
reading
the
bottle
itself
is
worth
the
price
of
purchase
drinkablitiy
is
almost
as
good
as
it
gets
very
easy
to
put
down
and
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
believe
the
hype
this
is
a
great
beer
i
bought
this
at
cost
plus
on
a
special
occasion
1
year
anniversary
at
my
job
i
was
intimidated
by
the
commentary
on
the
label
but
after
a
bottle
i
said
to
myself
this
is
what
beer
should
be
a
slight
bitter
taste
reminding
me
of
orange
peel
but
enough
to
make
it
beer
and
not
something
ghastly
the
smell
makes
you
think
im
getting
into
something
dangerous
the
aftertaste
says
give
me
another
bottle
and
dont
ruin
this
by
eating
anything
this
is
the
owsley
acid
of
beer
dont
ever
be
content
with
anything
less
unless
you
are
cheap
or
poor
overall
only
stone
could
make
a
beer
like
this
epic
in
every
possible
way
d
not
something
i
could
sit
and
session
mostly
because
it
makes
you
want
to
slow
down
and
savor
it
all
i
would
have
another
but
the
11th
ale
is
calling
me
drinkability
awesome
beer
cant
wait
for
this
beer
to
make
it
to
louisiana
overall
i
like
it
very
much
i
would
drink
it
more
often
if
it
were
lower
in
alcohol
and
if
i
could
find
some
in
smaller
bottles
i
loved
this
ale
its
like
stone
brewing
advertises
most
people
would
not
appreciate
an
ale
of
this
quality
and
complexity
i
fond
this
ale
to
be
very
satisfying
in
taste
with
a
nice
grapefruit
flavor
and
a
very
nice
citrus
aroma
this
is
one
of
the
ales
that
the
dryness
at
the
end
really
stands
out
and
is
appreciated
pours
a
nice
dark
amber
color
with
a
nice
semi
thick
head
this
is
one
of
the
most
amazing
ales
i
have
had
in
a
long
time
great
job
stone
brewing
its
a
good
thing
that
this
is
classified
as
a
strong
ale
because
this
isnt
for
the
weakhearted
it
also
has
decent
drinkability
for
such
a
strong
beer
but
may
burn
for
some
people
on
the
way
down
by
the
way
the
warmer
it
got
the
better
it
got
this
beer
really
has
it
all
i
have
had
this
in
the
bottle
offtap
and
in
growler
and
it
is
always
exceptional
recommendations
if
this
does
you
good
give
the
double
bastard
a
try
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
out
there
in
my
opinion
i
had
in
fact
expected
a
lot
more
from
this
one
it
really
sucks
that
i
had
to
go
out
of
my
way
in
austin
to
pick
up
a
bomber
of
this
excellent
brew
i
had
some
the
night
before
at
the
gingerman
downtown
and
just
knew
i
had
to
get
some
more
and
take
down
notes
maybe
one
day
in
a
perfect
beer
world
more
brews
like
this
one
will
be
available
in
north
carolina
very
drinkable
especially
with
the
right
meal
and
just
absolutely
delicious
deceivingly
drinkable
with
the
7
20
abv
that
is
mia
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
a
classic
and
must
try
one
of
the
first
beers
to
pique
my
interest
in
better
beer
and
a
great
eye
opening
beer
for
the
uninformed
great
classic
craft
beer
from
one
of
the
premier
california
craft
breweries
pours
a
dark
caramel
amber
with
a
nice
cream
colored
head
with
good
lacing
the
smell
is
bready
yeasty
caramelly
pineappley
and
very
hop
tastic
the
taste
is
roughly
the
same
with
less
fruitiness
and
more
raw
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
quite
drinkable
could
drink
several
of
these
abs
poured
into
a
pint
glass
from
a
bomber
the
beer
poured
a
dark
brown
forming
a
creamy
1
12
inch
head
lots
of
thick
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
a
strong
balanced
mix
of
hops
and
malts
nothing
really
different
but
still
good
the
taste
is
a
good
balanced
mix
of
hops
and
sweet
malt
with
a
hint
of
caramel
in
the
middle
and
a
slight
alcoholic
finish
medium
mouthfeel
overall
not
a
bad
beer
i
could
definitely
see
drinking
this
again
makes
a
good
session
ale
imo
i
cant
begin
to
explain
how
happy
my
mouth
is
right
now
my
palate
is
overflowing
with
citrus
caramel
some
fruits
has
a
nice
dry
bitter
finish
but
it
does
not
linger
as
long
as
would
be
expected
this
beer
is
definitely
worthy
its
easy
to
understand
why
this
beer
have
so
high
ratings
on
this
site
it
is
a
very
complex
ale
with
dipacharacteristics
it
is
not
an
easy
drink
tho
one
glass
was
more
than
enough
a
sipper
for
sure
recommended
m
thick
and
oily
mouthcoating
and
delicious
very
enjoyable
on
a
cool
night
this
beer
was
recomended
to
me
by
a
friend
and
i
have
to
say
he
was
dead
on
with
his
tip
this
beer
is
a
great
beer
it
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
2
finger
head
the
bottle
it
comes
in
was
bigger
than
the
glass
so
i
had
to
drink
some
before
emptying
the
bottle
into
the
glass
i
couldnt
really
pick
up
on
a
distinct
smell
it
just
smelled
to
me
like
an
english
dark
ale
the
taste
was
a
little
bitter
to
start
but
as
i
got
about
half
way
through
it
it
was
a
very
clean
and
crisp
taste
i
would
definatly
drink
this
beer
agian
and
recomend
this
to
anyone
who
wants
somthing
new
to
try
i
would
just
say
be
careful
when
drinking
this
it
is
a
little
higher
by
volume
than
most
beers
and
can
give
you
a
nice
festive
feeling
when
you
drink
it
ahh
the
old
classic
bastard
i
have
had
this
beer
many
times
and
it
was
one
of
the
first
big
beers
i
ever
had
it
is
a
dark
ruby
red
color
with
a
generous
fluffy
tan
head
this
is
a
good
looking
beer
that
borders
between
a
n
amber
and
a
brown
ale
in
color
the
smell
is
hoppy
and
malty
at
the
same
time
the
taste
is
like
a
battle
between
citrus
hops
and
caramel
tasting
malt
flavors
this
is
very
good
stuff
fresh
but
if
you
get
a
bottle
out
of
date
you
will
not
get
the
full
experience
on
this
one
the
hops
really
fade
too
bad
stone
cant
produce
this
in
six
packs
at
a
reasonable
price
d
i
love
this
stuff
stone
hits
another
home
run
with
ab
tasty
drinkable
the
alcohol
is
a
little
strong
for
a
session
beer
but
you
can
definitely
throw
a
couple
of
these
back
poured
a
dark
brownishred
with
an
amazing
tan
2
finger
head
that
lasted
an
impressive
while
the
scent
of
malt
and
citrusy
hops
are
present
initial
taste
reveals
an
explosion
of
different
flavors
maltsweet
brown
sugar
fruitsand
piney
finish
amazing
brew
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
inviting
with
a
nice
balance
of
carbonation
drinkability
is
definately
good
also
7
2
abv
is
hidden
well
in
this
one
id
definately
drink
a
couple
of
these
in
a
sitting
and
many
more
in
the
future
once
again
stone
kicks
ass
with
their
brews
and
bottling
overall
i
have
been
burned
by
marketing
before
but
this
bottle
is
hilarious
and
the
beer
is
awesome
a
great
blend
and
balance
of
flavors
one
of
the
reasons
i
wish
stone
was
available
here
in
minnesota
a
delight
to
drink
pours
a
ruby
dark
red
with
a
nice
off
white
head
that
sticks
around
and
has
lacing
with
a
python
grip
mild
smell
of
dried
fruit
hops
and
some
sweet
malt
hops
show
up
much
more
than
the
smell
would
indicate
fig
and
malt
stick
around
nicely
and
are
washed
out
by
tasty
hops
feels
full
bodied
with
perfect
carbonation
in
the
mouth
minimal
alcohol
feel
and
a
bitter
finish
could
make
quite
an
evening
out
of
this
brew
a
classic
in
my
book
i
got
through
about
10
oz
of
the
bottle
and
i
started
to
feel
a
buzz
so
the
drink
comes
down
a
bit
for
that
other
then
that
this
beer
is
very
awesome
and
i
recommened
anyong
worthy
to
try
it
ive
had
the
beer
on
tap
and
it
is
even
better
one
of
the
best
the
dark
amber
ale
poured
quite
nicely
leaving
a
frothy
head
this
ale
has
a
fruity
scent
to
it
the
hops
dominates
the
malt
in
nose
even
though
it
doesnt
when
you
actually
consume
the
worthy
beverage
the
ale
is
sweet
and
fruity
initially
and
then
turns
almost
sour
the
sour
soon
turns
to
the
hops
with
a
burnt
and
bitter
taste
i
found
nothing
unappealing
with
this
variation
of
tastes
you
mouth
feels
slightly
bitter
and
dry
when
all
said
and
done
the
more
you
drink
the
better
this
tastebud
rollercoaster
becomes
i
found
that
the
initial
tennis
match
back
and
forth
the
sweet
and
bitter
ended
well
balanced
by
the
bottom
of
the
glass
d
the
label
was
right
this
beer
is
exceedingly
complex
after
22
oz
my
world
has
officially
been
rocked
could
be
the
best
ale
ive
ever
had
but
like
an
ipa
its
intense
and
complex
taste
would
not
allow
me
to
drink
this
all
night
long
i
guess
i
just
cant
handle
it
d
this
is
great
very
easy
to
drink
and
still
very
complex
i
will
definitely
keep
this
one
on
my
wants
list
drinkability
so
far
my
reference
beer
for
american
strong
ale
i
will
try
many
to
see
if
any
one
can
knock
the
arrogant
bastard
off
his
pedestal
highly
recommended
thats
usually
the
case
with
stone
but
a
great
brewery
great
beers
this
one
will
not
let
you
down
now
go
fk
yourself
just
kidding
you
have
to
excuse
me
i
just
pounded
a
bomber
and
thats
the
arrogant
bastard
coming
out
of
me
poured
an
amazingly
fine
lightbrown
head
that
looked
like
it
belonged
on
a
stout
and
left
strings
of
lace
deep
mahogany
colored
beer
has
a
ruby
glow
when
back
lit
aroma
is
bursting
with
pineapple
along
with
candy
sugar
alcohol
and
rum
a
half
ton
of
citrus
hop
flavor
rides
a
firm
base
of
malty
goodness
finishes
fairly
bitter
but
with
lots
of
flavor
to
balance
it
out
the
bitterness
doesnt
seem
to
disappear
completely
and
builds
up
over
time
innnnteresting
while
the
body
is
full
the
mouthfeel
is
soft
and
smooth
making
for
a
soothing
drink
boy
do
i
miss
this
beer
smells
of
raisins
and
hops
deep
rich
flavor
alcohol
more
evident
than
expected
in
an
under
eight
percenter
almost
like
an
abby
ale
with
a
hoppy
kick
very
enjoyable
and
you
have
to
love
the
pure
arrogance
all
over
the
bottle
great
job
stone
d
as
warned
on
the
label
this
ale
is
definitely
not
for
a
novice
beer
drinker
strong
flavors
abound
good
drinkability
though
a
great
beer
from
stone
definitely
shows
what
theyre
about
note
have
had
much
more
of
this
in
the
interim
both
maltier
and
hoppier
than
previously
noted
and
more
complex
a
heavy
hitting
big
beer
d
well
ill
have
to
try
a
fresh
bottle
again
to
be
sure
but
ill
be
damned
if
this
old
bottle
of
arrogant
bastard
isnt
one
of
the
top
beers
ive
ever
had
complex
and
rich
with
the
age
making
it
smooth
and
the
body
full
and
satisfying
not
a
session
beer
especially
with
the
alcohol
content
but
certainly
something
i
would
never
turn
down
appearance
was
very
good
it
poured
to
about
a
two
fingered
head
the
head
remained
for
quite
a
while
the
lacing
was
very
evident
from
the
time
it
was
poured
until
the
time
it
was
drank
it
left
a
ring
around
the
glass
with
every
drink
the
ale
was
kind
of
a
reddish
brown
color
with
the
head
being
brownish
white
i
thought
the
taste
was
a
bit
stronger
than
most
dark
beers
it
definately
had
a
taste
that
had
to
be
acquired
mouthfeel
was
good
with
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
after
i
finished
my
22
oz
bottle
the
high
alcohol
content
was
evident
it
gave
my
a
good
head
rush
that
was
very
enjoyable
if
it
wasnt
for
the
high
price
i
definately
would
enjoy
this
beer
more
often
overall
an
excellent
brew
to
appreciate
higher
alcohol
content
and
aggressiveness
of
the
beer
as
a
whole
doesnt
lend
it
to
being
a
session
beer
i
cant
see
drinking
several
in
an
evening
but
i
can
see
enjoying
one
bottle
at
a
time
for
several
evenings
to
come
this
ale
was
everything
i
expected
definitely
not
a
sessionable
beer
but
one
to
enjoy
at
every
opportunity
this
is
pretty
drinkable
for
the
style
but
its
ultimately
not
the
most
memorable
or
inspiring
ale
notes
this
bottle
says
it
was
best
by
april
30
2007
i
consumed
it
about
7
weeks
beyond
that
but
i
dont
think
that
detracted
from
it
at
all
i
recently
drank
a
bottle
from
my
cellar
that
had
a
best
by
date
of
september
2005
that
hadnt
aged
well
it
had
lost
the
hop
bite
just
about
completely
younger
as
this
one
was
it
was
a
better
balanced
beer
smelled
better
and
was
more
drinkable
i
still
liked
it
better
on
tap
but
this
is
solid
in
a
bottle
too
just
dont
let
it
get
too
old
complexity
and
drinkability
in
the
same
package
great
offering
from
the
craft
beer
world
d
great
in
so
many
ways
the
description
on
the
bottle
was
hysterical
the
taste
is
outstanding
i
am
very
pleased
with
my
first
beer
from
stone
mostly
easy
drinking
recommended
22oz
bottle
no
freshness
date
noted
pours
a
clear
medium
brown
with
little
carbonation
but
lots
of
head
strong
malty
aroma
with
a
good
dose
of
hops
on
the
nose
as
well
the
flavour
is
less
interesting
than
i
was
hoping
for
heavy
on
the
malts
and
not
as
much
hops
as
i
thought
there
might
be
although
the
hop
taste
does
seem
to
grow
as
the
beer
goes
on
im
afraid
i
cant
rate
the
arrogant
bastard
nearly
as
high
as
most
people
here
perhaps
just
not
my
type
served
in
a
pint
glass
from
the
tap
appeared
a
wonderful
dark
amber
color
with
a
solid
one
finger
head
that
remained
throughout
aroma
of
floral
hops
covered
in
caramel
the
taste
is
where
this
flagship
of
the
stone
lineup
shines
great
fresh
floral
and
citrus
hop
flavors
combined
with
caramel
vanilla
and
slight
dark
chocolate
can
taste
the
beginnings
of
some
flavor
components
that
really
come
out
in
the
oaked
version
very
nice
velvety
feel
with
mediumheavy
body
good
drinkability
although
it
can
get
quite
filling
as
this
is
a
hefty
brew
this
is
definitely
one
of
my
alltime
favorites
thanks
to
its
bold
flavor
from
both
the
hop
and
malt
elements
a
drinker
this
ones
for
you
impressive
d
a
decent
strong
beer
too
many
though
and
you
will
pay
for
it
poured
from
a
22oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
this
ale
poured
a
darker
brown
with
a
thick
creamy
light
brown
head
that
slowly
faded
heavy
heavy
lacing
the
beer
smells
like
grapefruit
and
some
roasted
malts
the
beer
has
a
very
aggressive
bitterness
that
hits
your
tounge
before
you
can
discern
any
of
the
flavors
i
tasted
grapefruit
toast
pine
and
some
dark
fruit
notes
the
mouthfeel
is
slighty
resiny
mediumbodied
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
another
high
quality
brew
from
stone
hops
are
in
your
face
but
with
just
enough
malt
character
to
make
this
a
great
beer
notes
this
one
certainly
a
very
nice
brew
two
thumbs
up
to
stone
brewing
company
for
brewing
this
one
an
interesting
style
quite
the
year
round
brew
cheers
i
give
them
high
kudos
for
the
name
they
gave
this
beer
it
fits
it
in
everyway
damn
arrogant
bastard
good
carbonation
not
to
fizzy
easy
to
drink
but
a
bit
of
a
challenge
with
the
abv
when
coming
out
of
a
bomber
d
i
think
this
is
one
of
the
most
drinkable
beers
you
can
find
at
least
for
those
of
us
in
the
western
half
of
america
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
find
affordable
and
of
the
finest
quality
id
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
is
interested
in
american
ales
d
god
damn
i
love
this
beer
its
overpowering
raw
in
your
face
all
while
being
tasty
and
delicious
a
completely
unique
american
craft
brew
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
has
a
high
drinkability
factor
mostly
because
it
tastes
so
good
deep
color
and
full
of
complexity
it
goes
perfectly
with
a
nice
filet
mignon
we
started
with
this
as
our
dinner
beer
and
it
moved
itself
to
our
after
dinner
beer
as
well
killer
the
bomber
poured
an
impressive
ruby
red
liquid
capped
with
a
dense
thick
off
white
head
great
looking
brew
fine
splotchy
lacing
smell
is
sweet
malt
caramel
and
pine
toasty
malt
start
and
piny
hop
finish
spicy
alcohol
is
there
as
well
crisp
and
oily
in
the
mouth
nice
after
taste
chewy
wish
i
had
got
another
bomber
impressive
taste
is
of
bitter
ascerbic
hops
with
some
coffee
roasted
nut
and
an
alcoholic
note
to
boot
mouthfeel
is
definately
not
shy
about
its
bitterness
as
it
attacks
the
back
of
the
palate
sans
remorse
some
might
consider
it
a
bit
overwheming
in
relation
to
the
taste
but
its
still
enjoyable
finishing
remarks
big
aroma
big
taste
big
beer
definately
not
to
be
taken
lightly
but
nonetheless
an
enjoyable
drink
in
the
mouth
it
starts
off
big
but
unfocused
some
dark
ripe
fruits
are
there
like
plum
and
raisin
but
its
vague
stale
old
flavors
are
very
dissapointing
despite
it
being
passed
its
prime
date
i
imaginged
a
high
alcohol
would
have
preserved
its
flavor
better
maybe
the
stores
storage
was
poor
there
is
an
okay
hop
bitter
finish
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
mouthfeel
couldnt
make
up
for
its
flavor
being
syrupy
it
had
a
big
body
but
it
also
finished
thin
and
watery
drinkability
suffers
for
it
just
being
so
unfocused
and
boring
but
i
still
wonder
if
its
just
its
age
coming
through
out
of
a
paintedlabel
bomber
into
a
few
glasses
to
split
with
my
brothers
we
have
a
hazy
orangy
brown
brew
with
a
nice
thick
head
looks
appealing
the
aroma
wasnt
too
huge
mostly
sweet
and
syrupy
lots
of
punch
upon
tasting
it
though
caramel
a
little
ripened
berry
alcohol
but
not
much
and
a
very
hoppy
finish
with
a
lingering
aftertaste
really
nice
in
the
mouth
all
creamy
and
smooth
well
carbonated
a
serious
beer
but
quite
consumable
this
is
a
great
ale
i
would
drink
over
and
over
comes
out
of
the
bottle
a
dark
hazy
brown
has
a
very
good
malt
colored
head
with
average
retention
smell
is
hoppy
and
malty
at
the
same
time
the
first
thing
i
taste
is
lots
of
malt
followed
by
lots
of
hop
a
very
hop
bitter
beer
i
think
it
needs
something
else
i
like
stone
ipa
much
better
why
does
only
california
know
that
cadmium
can
cause
birth
defects
had
this
last
night
on
tap
at
toronado
where
they
were
featuring
stone
beers
at
first
look
it
was
a
deep
amber
but
holding
up
to
the
light
you
see
it
is
a
brilliant
red
not
much
head
and
lacing
very
aromatic
hops
which
led
me
to
believe
that
the
hops
would
overpower
in
the
taste
however
this
was
not
so
definitely
hop
forward
but
with
refinement
other
brewers
should
take
note
good
balance
in
the
mouthfeel
refreshing
yet
substance
as
ive
stated
before
im
not
much
of
a
hop
ale
drinker
but
i
did
enjoy
this
dvery
good
i
could
have
several
of
these
d
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
as
it
has
for
probably
most
of
the
people
who
have
tasted
it
not
a
beer
that
i
want
to
drink
all
night
but
would
not
mind
spliting
a
couple
of
bomber
of
this
with
a
friend
next
time
strong
malty
and
definitely
not
like
anything
ive
had
from
around
this
area
i
can
easily
see
why
beers
from
the
stone
brewing
company
are
held
in
such
high
regard
i
especially
like
the
aftertaste
it
leaves
very
good
d
because
of
the
balance
the
drinkability
is
pretty
good
but
because
of
how
strong
it
is
you
must
be
a
glutton
for
intensity
to
have
more
than
one
bomber
pours
a
deep
mahogany
red
with
a
soapy
tan
head
smells
malty
caramel
with
some
piney
hops
theres
a
lot
going
on
in
this
brew
hops
are
everywhere
the
malt
is
a
good
backing
dark
fruits
piney
hops
toasty
caramel
hops
and
a
bit
of
warming
alcohol
delicious
it
all
balances
out
and
although
coming
up
as
an
in
your
face
brew
tastes
great
syrupy
light
carbonation
i
wish
this
was
available
here
thanks
to
ostrungt
for
the
trade
taste
quite
light
i
was
surprised
actually
since
most
stones
product
i
had
my
hands
on
were
quite
rich
and
extreme
beers
full
complex
at
first
the
hops
come
in
to
tickle
your
palate
followed
by
a
sweet
caramel
and
chocolate
flavours
of
the
malt
arrogant
bastard
pours
a
clear
deep
red
with
a
nice
thick
head
taste
is
bitter
upfront
and
lastingly
bitter
the
hops
are
citrusy
piney
and
herbal
behind
the
huge
hops
hides
a
delicious
malt
character
sweet
dark
fruits
mixed
with
tropical
fruits
this
is
one
great
beer
brutal
and
offensive
but
in
a
good
way
i
know
some
may
consider
it
not
respecting
beer
but
i
like
this
one
out
of
the
bottle
as
well
as
in
the
glass
i
find
i
taste
the
delicious
maltiness
more
ive
heard
a
lot
about
this
beer
so
i
was
excited
to
try
it
i
eventually
drank
the
whole
22
oz
by
myself
pours
a
delicious
reddishbrown
nice
and
clear
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
very
good
retention
some
lacing
on
the
pint
glass
smells
and
tastes
of
toasted
malts
caramel
toffee
nuts
i
thought
this
was
a
strong
chewy
brown
ale
at
first
good
balance
with
some
mild
hops
a
bit
of
warming
alcohol
excellent
mouthfeel
for
the
decently
thick
flavors
i
think
this
was
spoton
ive
had
far
too
many
watereddown
strong
ales
overall
an
exceptional
beer
great
body
wonderful
balance
of
flavors
all
the
elements
work
together
to
make
this
a
highly
drinkable
beer
i
can
see
why
so
many
people
consider
this
a
standard
in
the
american
craft
beer
repertoire
first
sip
holy
fuck
this
beer
is
worth
writing
home
to
my
mother
about
arrogant
bastard
has
it
all
delicious
malts
like
caramel
and
honey
delicious
hops
like
grapefruit
and
earth
this
thing
is
a
beast
but
not
an
evil
arrogant
beast
more
in
the
vain
of
i
taste
delicate
and
complex
and
i
will
make
you
play
wu
tang
on
the
jukebox
and
make
an
ass
out
of
yourself
this
beer
jams
you
should
drink
it
smooth
mouthfeel
with
perfect
carbonation
one
of
my
all
time
favorites
complex
and
drinkable
a
bit
too
high
in
alcohol
and
too
harsh
on
the
front
end
to
be
very
drinkable
there
is
a
lot
of
hype
behind
this
beer
and
to
some
people
that
is
a
bad
thing
it
is
definitely
a
good
brew
i
have
had
other
beers
that
dont
live
up
to
the
hype
i
think
this
one
does
plus
it
is
a
great
value
at
3
99
a
bomber
thank
you
grapevine
market
especially
with
the
7
2
abv
try
it
if
you
havent
i
am
definitely
going
to
have
another
d
this
beer
will
mess
you
up
if
you
are
in
the
mood
for
something
big
this
will
quench
your
thirst
if
you
are
not
in
the
mood
for
a
monster
wait
for
another
day
though
a
bit
on
the
heavy
side
but
not
incredibly
hard
to
drink
this
is
a
good
beer
but
a
bit
to
strong
for
my
personal
tastes
i
could
not
have
more
than
one
in
quite
some
time
anyway
recommended
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
good
session
beer
even
with
the
high
abv
i
was
really
very
very
surprised
in
a
good
way
definitely
want
some
more
of
this
one
this
beer
is
above
average
overallbut
a
little
bit
over
hyped
there
are
hoppier
more
complex
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
brews
out
there
this
just
didnt
live
up
to
my
expectations
i
will
probably
have
it
again
i
do
not
hate
it
nor
am
i
in
love
with
it
poured
into
my
specialty
arrogant
bastard
glass
pours
an
amazing
amber
rustic
color
with
a
fluffy
head
that
leaves
heavy
lace
on
the
glass
and
stays
the
entire
time
little
carbonation
bubbles
float
through
this
wonder
looking
ale
smell
is
a
bit
citrusy
hoppy
smelling
also
has
a
bit
of
an
earthy
smell
to
it
as
well
taste
is
a
well
balanced
masterpiece
of
a
bit
of
hop
bitterness
followed
by
bark
with
a
bit
of
a
roasted
malt
and
barley
aftertaste
also
a
bit
of
grapefruit
bitterness
towards
the
end
simply
put
this
is
one
fine
damn
ale
and
one
of
the
greatest
brews
around
top
notch
drinkability
i
understand
why
i
give
it
the
score
i
gave
it
it
just
goes
to
show
that
palates
change
from
time
to
time
its
not
my
favorite
of
stones
products
as
this
bastard
will
come
right
after
you
this
is
a
beer
that
gets
better
the
more
samples
you
have
of
it
the
original
overall
score
was
3
85
the
beer
poured
a
rich
deep
amber
almost
brown
with
a
frothy
head
that
slowly
diminished
but
not
completely
and
left
great
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
was
of
pine
hops
and
burnt
caramel
the
taste
is
very
well
balanced
between
caramel
and
some
brown
malts
along
with
earthy
pine
hops
they
balance
so
well
that
both
seem
to
dominate
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
and
although
a
little
alcohol
shows
its
not
at
all
overbearing
this
is
one
of
my
absolute
favorite
beers
probably
should
be
a
sipper
but
one
can
feel
the
beer
making
fun
of
your
lack
of
manhood
and
you
find
yourself
unable
to
stop
drinking
this
awesome
beer
pouring
out
of
a
tall
bottle
the
appearance
of
the
beer
was
a
deep
red
colour
the
smell
was
sweet
a
combination
of
hops
and
malts
with
a
touch
of
fruitiness
the
taste
is
possible
the
best
it
has
an
instant
smoky
taste
but
it
quickly
settles
into
the
palate
with
a
smooth
finish
not
quite
fizzy
but
soft
in
the
mouth
as
for
the
drinkability
one
bottle
would
be
sufficient
to
enjoy
in
an
odd
way
it
complemented
the
sushi
i
had
earlier
in
the
meal
i
really
enjoyed
this
brew
from
stone
drinkability
bitter
start
but
you
get
used
to
it
quickly
light
body
tasted
it
with
food
and
the
bitterness
softened
and
only
then
did
the
rest
of
the
beers
flavors
seem
to
strengthen
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
definitely
not
an
everyday
beer
but
one
i
will
definitely
come
back
to
in
the
future
it
is
good
for
special
occasions
and
last
night
it
did
a
great
job
at
taking
the
edge
off
of
an
especially
long
stessfilled
day
at
work
d
not
an
everyday
brew
but
a
great
example
of
a
strong
american
ale
everyone
should
try
this
at
least
once
cheers
d
not
too
high
in
alcohol
but
not
a
session
beer
either
i
think
this
is
one
of
those
beers
you
get
a
hankering
for
and
really
enjoy
but
probably
isnt
the
type
of
beer
youd
want
a
sixer
of
very
fun
tasty
and
enjoyable
beer
note
as
it
warms
it
becomes
more
smooth
bomber
pour
cellar
temperature
into
a
pint
glass
pours
the
color
of
cherry
wood
dark
with
some
streaks
of
ruby
big
yellowcream
head
that
eventually
fades
to
a
collar
as
expected
huge
hops
aroma
with
just
a
touch
of
malt
foundation
the
hops
are
heavy
on
the
metals
relatively
light
on
the
citrus
but
american
all
the
way
on
the
palate
smooth
pale
malts
hit
the
tongue
first
off
but
the
flavors
move
toward
the
back
of
the
tongue
very
quickly
displaying
lots
of
hop
oils
and
citrus
notes
metals
are
toned
down
from
the
aroma
very
strong
oily
bitterness
is
the
key
theme
here
from
the
midpalate
through
the
finish
my
mouth
is
coated
with
hop
oils
its
rough
tough
and
definitely
not
subtle
overall
this
is
the
quintessential
american
strong
ale
big
alcohol
very
hoppy
not
too
balanced
with
malts
not
really
my
style
but
good
for
what
it
is
commentsd
a
strong
in
your
face
aggressive
beer
leans
a
little
heavily
on
the
hop
side
for
me
drinkability
is
good
certainly
worth
getting
more
22oz
bottle
poured
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
decent
tan
head
that
sticks
to
the
glass
the
smell
has
some
citrus
and
sweet
malt
notes
taste
is
mostly
a
grapefruit
rind
with
lots
of
bitterness
the
feel
seems
medium
bodied
and
has
a
stickiness
to
it
this
brew
is
very
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
and
one
of
my
regular
go
to
brews
if
im
out
of
the
double
or
oaked
versions
aroma
is
very
strong
even
from
a
distance
caramel
or
chocolate
malts
backing
up

huge
pine
and
grapefruit
hop
assault
taste
is
excellently
balanced
with
good
bready
malt
flavours
and
powerful
earthy
hops
excellent
mouthfeel
and
a
sour
citrusy
aftertaste
well
done
of
course
and
a
great
drinkable
hoppy
beer
that
doesnt
waste
the
taste

thick

also
thirstquenching

strong
wet
ale

and
good
so
drinkable
for
such
a
strong
ale
oaky
alcoholy
strong
rich
youre
not
worthy
poured
a
decent
sized
head
that
reduced
leaving
thick
sticky
beige
lacing
the
head
also
reduced
to
a
very
thick
chunky
offwhite
layer
of
foam
the
color
is
a
reddishbrown
each
sip
left
a
ring
of
lace
that
circled
my
glass
the
appearance
is
good
but
not
worthy
to
be
considered
in
the
4
55
range
very
aromatic
hop
filled
nose
coupled
with
a
strong
fruit
smell
bitterness
overshadows
most
of
the
tastes
present
would
like
to
see
more
carbonation
in
the
mouthfeel
it
is
finished
being
somewhat
flat
alcohol
is
hidden
making
it
go
down
smoother
than
it
should
being
such
a
fullbodied
ale
strong
phenolic
notes
noted
on
the
finish
long
lingering
bitterness
on
the
aftertaste
it
is
not
really
balanced
in
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
areas
overall
a
great
brew
and
worth
a
repeated
buy
my
two
reviews
of
this
beer
are
different
because
my
knowledge
of
beer
and
reviewing
have
changed
since
my
last
review
of
3
years
ago
i
had
heard
about
this
beer
from
a
friend
and
decided
to
try
it
i
heard
it
was
bitter
and
it
lives
up
to
the
hype
i
thought
after
a
couple
of
swigs
i
would
get
used
to
the
bitterness
but
i
didnt
i
will
try
this
beer
again
when
my
sophistication
changes
heh
heh
i
found
out
a
local
bar
had
this
so
i
had
to
try
some
i
love
the
fact
that
it
says
right
on
the
bottle
you
wont
like
this
beer
because
all
of
my
friends
who
are
regulars
of
the
american
macros
definitely
dont
have
the
palate
for
such
a
beer
the
beer
pours
a
cloudy
brownishred
color
with
a
yellow
colored
creamy
head
the
smell
is
of
pineycitrus
hops
very
present
there
is
an
initial
sweetness
followed
by
a
hopbomb
similar
to
the
nose
that
lingers
on
the
palate
for
hours
after
the
beer
is
finished
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
decent
amount
of
carbonation
a
drinkable
beer
the
hop
presence
could
easily
be
too
much
for
most
but
if
you
are
a
hop
head
you
should
definitely
try
this
beer
after
that
first
taste
of
arrogant
bastard
three
years
ago
i
had
to
look
it
up
online
a
quick
google
search
led
me
to
my
first
ever
visit
to
beeradvocate
com
i
have
a
lot
to
owe
to
ab
and
rightfully
so
its
a
great
beer
22
oz
bottle
into
a
pilsner
glass
pours
a
deep
reddishamber
nice
finger
of
head
looks
pretty
tasty
nose
is
incredibly
strong
lots
of
hops
and
even
the
malty
fruity
sweetness
comes
through
definitely
not
your
average
ipa
although
it
doesnt
look
as
though
they
even
classify
it
as
such
taste
is
incredible
amazing
balance
of
hoppy
bitterness
and
complex
malt
flavors
caramel
and
raisins
and
about
a
thousand
other
things
really
an
amazing
taste
feel
is
fairly
heavy
i
needed
something
lighter
after
to
ease
up
on
the
pallet
a
little
and
fullbodied
good
carbonation
overall
a
really
delicious
beer
the
first
time
i
had
this
one
it
was
too
much
for
me
i
couldnt
handle
it
just
like
the
bottle
says
but
after
having
a
couple
more
this
one
really
comes
through
as
original
and
quite
delicious
only
the
fairly
high
alcohol
content
might
limit
it
drinkability
i
could
make
this
sessionable
this
bastard
really
does
seems
to
live
up
to
its
reputation
much
better
than
the
levitation
i
am
excited
to
try
the
double
and
oaked
bastards
in
my
fridge
recommeded
highly
recommended
beer
there
is
so
much
going
on
in
this
beer
that
it
is
better
experienced
than
explained
i
keep
a
spare
in
the
fridge
to
share
with
any
misguided
friends
that
wonder
in
with
inferior
beer
in
their
arms
at
least
for
once
they
get
to
experience
what
a
real
beer
is
all
about
enjoy
it
if
you
get
the
chance
cheers
ive
had
this
beer
many
times
before
but
this
is
the
first
time
ive
reviewed
it
this
bastard
never
fails
to
please
drinkability
high
eov
for
me
and
many
others
arrogant
bastard
pretty
much
defines
the
concept
of
the
big
beer
this
is
an
experience
anyone
who
likes
beer
should
have
definitely
one
of
my
favorite
ales
and
one
of
the
top
overall
as
far
as
im
concerned
theres
a
lot
of
hype
around
this
ale
but
theres
a
reason
for
it
bottom
line
a
fantastic
brew
that
will
earn
your
attention
whether
you
wish
to
or
not
highly
recommended
glad
i
finally
got
around
to
reviewing
this
it
is
truly
wonderful
this
beer
pours
a
nice
brown
color
with
a
tan
head
not
much
carbonation
on
the
pour
the
smell
is
a
pleasant
fruity
smell
this
beer
is
very
well
balanced
and
is
just
a
great
beer
that
i
could
drink
over
and
over
again
great
mouthfeel
excellent
taste
with
a
fruity
aftertaste
good
beer
but
i
would
like
to
try
it
closer
to
its
source
poured
a
reddish
brown
with
nice
head
retention
great
fresh
hop
aromas
cascade
off
the
pint
glass
cirtusy
piney
nice
flavors
are
all
over
the
place
a
somewhat
spicy
fruity
alcoholic
malt
with
an
oatmeal
thickness
and
slight
sweet
character
atttempts
to
fend
off
the
assertive
hops
no
way
the
finish
is
a
sticky
hop
bomb
with
some
malt
along
for
the
ride
very
nice
wish
there
was
some
on
tap
right
now
pours
a
near
perfect
ruby
brown
color
with
minimal
carbonation
the
smell
is
deep
and
rich
but
not
at
all
overpowering
the
taste
is
a
surprising
combination
of
depth
of
flavor
smoothness
and
pure
potency
the
hops
and
the
malt
stand
alone
on
their
own
merits
but
are
delivered
in
a
perfect
balance
the
mouthfeel
is
unusually
light
for
beer
of
this
nature
but
not
at
all
disappointing
as
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
ever
tasted
the
drinkability
is
good
to
say
the
least
mouthfeeldrinkability
a
wimpy
texture
is
all
we
get
here
after
all
this
haughtiness
surprisingly
most
of
the
carbonation
of
this
beer
is
released
and
spent
in
the
enormous
magnificent
head
thin
on
its
way
in
the
mouth
it
never
develops
an
interesting
enough
body
to
showcase
the
massive
character
but
since
the
flavor
holds
its
own
its
not
a
dealbreaker
with
a
smile
i
gulp
and
belch
the
rest
of
this
ale
down
realizing
that
one
of
these
is
enough
but
damn
im
enjoying
this
tasting
d
this
brew
would
get
an
good
rating
for
drinkability
from
me
if
it
werent
for
the
excessive
sweetness
at
the
end
in
my
opinion
the
sweet
finish
just
sticks
around
too
long
and
i
found
myself
wanting
a
glass
of
water
by
the
time
i
finished
the
pint
i
know
it
seems
kind
of
strange
to
have
such
a
large
gap
between
dinkability
and
flavor
but
this
brew
is
defenitely
not
meant
to
be
a
session
beer
that
said
the
complexity
of
this
beer
is
defenitely
something
that
should
not
be
ignored
also
watch
out
for
the
kick
of
this
brew
as
the
abv
is
nothing
to
sneeze
at
mouthfeeldrinkability
this
is
a
great
beer
its
got
a
nice
sweet
taste
to
it
and
evolves
into
a
rush
of
bitterness
this
really
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
definitely
a
regular
in
my
fridge
but
one
bomber
is
enough
for
me
no
more
than
that
overall
i
highly
recommend
it
truly
a
classic
sure
to
bring
out
the
arrogance
in
all
of
us
this
beer
is
godawful
i
have
no
idea
why
it
got
such
high
reviews
i
couldnt
even
finish
the
stuff
as
my
taste
buds
had
decided
to
mutiny
22
oz
bottle
this
one
poured
dark
amber
with
nice
fat
tan
head
that
left
great
lacing
strong
hops
and
malts
greet
your
nose
and
the
richness
takes
over
your
mouth
in
a
hurry
flavor
is
sublime
hops
are
agressive
yet
still
under
control
this
is
everything
a
craft
beer
should
be
yum
yum
yum
love
this
one
this
was
my
first
taste
of
a
caskconditioned
ale
and
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
what
i
got
was
not
what
i
thought
i
would
if
nice
clear
deep
amber
color
and
rich
head
had
me
excited
the
smell
was
very
heavy
on
hops
which
a
rep
from
stone
told
me
were
centennial
hops
he
then
told
me
about
how
the
dry
hopping
process
worked
before
i
took
my
first
sip
the
malt
i
expected
from
the
bastard
wasnt
as
apparent
as
i
thought
it
would
be
however
despite
the
hoppiness
it
was
a
very
smooth
drink
i
anxiously
await
my
next
chance
to
try
a
cask
ale
and
hope
i
enjoy
it
just
as
much
drinkability
i
am
not
worthy
but
fortunately
they
still
let
me
buy
a
bottle
and
taste
this
fantastic
brew
i
wouldnt
want
this
at
a
summer
picnic
after
a
day
in
the
sun
but
fortunately
for
me
it
is
february
this
is
highly
drinkable
and
enjoyable
as
there
is
nothing
about
the
complex
profile
that
isnt
incredibly
enjoyable
tastes
much
better
than
standard
arrogant
smooth
and
drinkable
but
still
the
hop
bomb
that
the
bastard
is
known
for
worth
some
hype
by
any
means
but
the
smoked
porter
and
old
guardian
06
were
easier
drinkers
pours
a
mahogany
color
but
probably
a
bit
lighter
that
the
original
thick
creamy
nearly
white
head
with
excellent
retention
and
lacing
seems
very
standard
for
a
solid
cask
beer
big
hoppy
aroma
centennial
hops
seem
to
be
the
showcase
as
floral
and
citrus
notes
are
present
toffee
caramel
and
a
bit
of
fig
are
somewhat
hidden
behind
a
great
amount
of
floral
citrusy
and
piney
hops
the
creamy
feel
and
low
soft
carbonation
make
this
treat
oh
so
drinkable
thank
you
stone
for
bringing
this
to
bostons
as
part
of
the
most
arrogant
pub
celebration
a
real
treat
to
have
a
cask
beer
like
this
this
beer
being
cask
makes
it
just
too
drinkable
drinkability
this
is
one
of
those
occasional
treat
beers
or
maybe
just
when
your
feeling
extra
arrogant
for
all
its
heavy
dutiness
it
is
actually
quite
drinkable
though
i
wouldnt
want
to
drink
it
all
the
time
at
7
2
it
is
strong
enough
to
provide
a
nice
buzz
with
just
one
22
oz
bottle
so
you
dont
need
to
drink
as
much
of
this
as
of
other
beers
for
me
this
is
the
perfect
hybrid
between
a
session
beer
and
a
sipping
beer
drinkability
as
the
label
hilariously
advises
this
is
not
a
beer
for
everyone
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
a
serious
american
ale
though
as
i
was
tonight
you
could
drink
these
all
night
at
7
2
that
would
of
course
be
a
somewhat
dangerous
proposition
wow
this
is
good
stuff
pours
with
a
huge
wellretaining
head
hue
is
dark
brown
and
the
nose
is
a
strange
combination
of
chocolatebanana
hops
and
lemon
this
head
is
going
nowhere
taste
is
very
good
bitter
hops
up
front
give
way
to
some
glorious
malts
with
a
nice
roastedness
and
a
reappearance
from
the
banana
mouthfeel
is
excellent
and
the
finish
is
earthy
and
it
makes
my
mouth
water
like
quench
chewing
gum
the
alcohol
is
pleasantly
subdued
for
the
abv
this
is
seriously
growing
on
me
even
though
the
alcohol
isnt
overpowering
it
still
gives
you
a
little
chest
warmth
the
aftertaste
is
caramellike
with
a
load
of
grassy
bitter
hops
ok
the
head
is
still
70after
five
minutes
impressive
i
appreciate
their
arrogance
this
is
first
rate
would
like
to
try
the
oaked
version
served
slightly
chilled
in
a
pint
glass
poured
a
beautiful
reddishcopper
color
with
about
one
finger
of
bubbly
white
head
head
slowly
dissipated
into
a
thick
swirl
of
lace
in
the
center
of
the
glass
smelled
of
strong
bittering
hops
dark
dried
fruits
and
faint
notes
of
alcohol
tasted
pretty
hoppy
somewhat
malty
with
moderate
carbonation
and
plenty
of
smooth
alcohol
in
the
finish
was
a
great
well
balanced
ale
that
gets
high
marks
for
leaving
me
wanting
more
beer
poured
a
nice
dark
red
almost
black
carbonation
appropriate
with
mild
head
smell
very
hoppy
and
floral
with
some
nice
spice
taste
was
hop
hop
and
hop
very
nice
great
bitter
finish
nice
strong
mouthfeel
good
consistency
very
drinkable
very
good
very
recommended
for
the
uninitiated
the
youre
not
worthy
moniker
may
apply
as
it
may
take
a
slightly
more
refined
palate
to
appreciate
this
one
but
for
those
looking
for
a
hoppy
bastard
of
a
brew
you
should
look
no
further
as
a
side
note
ive
been
drinking
this
beer
a
lot
recently
and
still
love
it
just
as
much
or
more
than
when
i
originally
wrote
the
review
i
managed
to
try
some
on
tap
last
night
and
was
absolutely
floored
the
head
was
remarkable
was
a
little
harsh
for
me
the
first
couple
times
but
after
that
i
see
the
hype
beautiful
looking
beer
as
most
of
stones
are
nice
head
thick
lacing
down
the
glass
bloody
red
color
with
some
banana
maybe
plum
and
high
hops
on
the
kickback
almost
like
a
souped
up
ipa
lots
of
banana
on
the
smell
and
many
malts
a
bit
harsh
on
the
go
down
but
an
excellent
beer
nonetheless
this
is
a
brew
that
isnt
afraid
of
hops
and
knows
how
to
use
them
its
not
overthetop
its
strong
and
balanced
nicely
arrogant
bastard
gets
a
good
deal
of
publicity
as
some
superbeer
it
is
undeniably
good
much
better
than
your
average
available
but
it
is
nothing
to
obsess
over
also
i
like
the
arrogant
bottle
poured
out
of
the
22oz
bomber
the
color
was
an
auburn
brown
color
that
was
clear
had
a
pillowy
tan
head
that
left
fantastic
lacing
the
smell
was
weaker
than
expected
but
still
had
a
good
wiff
of
buddy
hops
the
taste
is
what
makes
this
brew
unique
it
has
qualities
of
a
porter
and
an
aipa
the
taste
is
of
floral
hops
roasted
malts
strong
the
ale
has
a
nice
creamy
moderate
mouthfeel
that
finishes
a
bit
dry
drinkability
very
tasty
beer
that
deserves
the
recognition
its
received
cant
wait
to
go
poor
the
rest
of
that
22ozs
and
really
enjoy
that
7
2
abv
d
a
very
heavy
ale
that
packs
a
good
punch
im
now
left
with
about
9
oz
left
of
a
22
oz
bottle
and
i
feel
pretty
happy
good
thing
this
is
expensive
otherwise
youd
be
in
a
world
of
hurt
the
next
morning
not
too
shabby
so
well
made
i
sat
down
on
a
winter
night
after
working
a
swing
shift
and
enjoyed
the
heck
out
of
it
got
a
little
loopy
too
if
only
i
didnt
have
to
get
it
mail
order
poured
out
of
a
22
oz
bomber
into
a
wide
mouthed
wine
glass
pours
an
amber
brown
color
i
didnt
get
too
much
on
the
nose
at
first
taste
all
i
got
was
the
flavor
of
hops
but
after
it
warmed
up
the
hoppiness
dissipated
and
it
showed
a
malty
nutty
flavor
that
was
complemented
by
hop
bitterness
the
flavor
makes
me
long
for
almond
crusted
walleye
to
complement
it
overall
it
is
a
fine
example
of
the
style
i
could
not
have
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
that
is
for
sure
it
is
complex
in
many
ways
and
is
a
must
have
for
american
strong
ale
lovers
i
am
more
of
an
imperial
stout
man
myself
but
can
definitely
appreciate
what
this
brew
has
to
offer
this
is
a
great
brew
worth
giving
a
try
to
avoid
the
aftertaste
keep
drinking
this
feels
very
syrupy
and
smooth
with
a
moderate
amount
of
co2
there
is
a
slight
oilyness
from
the
hops
and
a
warm
follow
through
after
each
sip
sometime
hard
to
find
but
a
exceptional
beer
form
the
first
mouth
full
one
is
forced
to
say
holy
molly
thats
good
beer
i
would
love
to
try
this
beer
on
tap
i
think
you
lose
a
bit
of
taste
in
a
bottle
the
bottle
is
good
try
this
beer
as
of
this
review
there
are
1040
reviews
applied
i
got
one
of
these
via
trade
not
sure
the
age
but
i
think
its
around
a
year
or
so
in
the
bottle
tasty
a
bit
reserved
in
the
hops
flavor
and
aroma
compared
to
a
fresh
version
i
liked
it
better
with
some
age
on
it
i
could
imagine
it
cellaring
a
year
or
two
longer
and
seeing
how
it
comes
out
while
not
in
my
market
i
can
see
why
people
like
this
brew
for
today
ill
leave
the
expansive
descriptions
to
the
other
1040
people
poured
from
a
1
pt
6
fluid
oz
bottle
into
a
glass
love
the
bottle
which
is
worth
the
read
for
the
entertainment
wonderful
ruby
brown
color
with
a
sturdy
tan
head
that
left
an
appealing
lace
in
my
glass
smell
was
very
complex

there
is
a
lot
going
on
here
hops
are
all
over
the
place
as
well
as
the
roasted
grains
the
fruit
esters
very
enjoyable
complex
flavor
that
i
found
to
be
more
enjoyable
as
the
beer
warmed
a
bit
this
beer
is
hard
to
find
in
my
area
but
it
was
worth
all
the
effort
i
enjoyed
this
beer
very
much
and
would
gladly
purchase
more
now
if
only
they
would
export
this
from
usa
to
can
only
the
slight
heaviness
keeps
this
beer
from
being
more
drinkable
otherwise
its
the
most
flavorful
beer
ive
enjoyed
to
date
not
really
that
drinkable
due
to
the
overly
carbonated
profile
and
unbalanced
profile
just
like
the
bottle
says
i
probably
wont
like
it
well
ill
give
it
a
why
the
hell
not
d
alright
if
you
love
bittering
hops
then
this
is
for
you
i
think
it
could
use
a
bit
more
depth
in
flavor
to
be
a
truly
great
beer
but
a
great
delivery
of
what
i
believe
the
brewer
is
intending
this
to
be
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
beer
poured
a
very
nice
amber
mahogany
shade
nice
thick
one
finger
head
that
stayed
more
or
less
towards
the
end
of
the
drink
lacing
was
decent
mouthfeel
to
me
was
pretty
good
but
a
bit
bitter
i
like
bitter
but
it
lingered
a
bit
longer
than
i
would
have
liked
other
than
that
taste
was
awesome
nice
and
malty
with
enough
hops
to
balance
it
out
i
would
recommend
this
to
any
fan
of
nice
dark
ales
waited
quite
a
while
to
try
this
beer
have
to
come
right
out
and
say
that
its
a
damn
tasty
brew
and
i
wish
i
could
have
more
already
this
beer
has
a
deep
amber
color
with
decent
head
that
fades
quite
a
bit
but
has
a
slight
amount
of
retention
smell
is
dominated
by
hops
but
doesnt
over
power
it
i
think
they
are
amarillos
but
not
sure
taste
is
wonderful
a
close
perfect
balance
between
malt
and
hops
one
doesnt
over
power
the
other
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
very
high
i
could
confidently
say
that
i
would
drink
one
of
these
everyday
if
given
the
chance
stone
please
distribute
to
iowa
ive
heard
a
lot
about
this
beer
pours
amber
nice
head
with
good
retention
and
lacing
smell
is
not
as
strong
as
expected
sweet
citrus
and
hops
mostly
body
is
thick
with
some
carbionation
taste
is
a
good
combionation
of
sweet
dark
fruits
and
nice
earthy
hops
very
good
the
head
is
thick
and
frothy
very
nice
it
stayed
even
until
the
last
drink
the
color
is
dark
brown
with
an
amber
hue
to
it
the
smell
is
slightly
roasty
slightly
sweet
and
a
little
musky
the
taste
is
very
hoppymusky
and
powerful
it
tastes
a
bit
old
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
lacking
its
a
bit
harsh
overall
i
will
try
this
one
again
but
its
not
my
session
beer
a
very
pretty
dark
redbrown
color
with
a
thick
offwhite
head
it
had
a
sweet
citrusy
aroma
as
well
as
some
malt
the
taste
was
similar
to
the
aroma
citrus
and
a
good
lingering
bitterness
maybe
the
bitterness
stayed
a
little
too
long
but
thats
a
minor
quibble
this
was
a
good
beer
to
drink
very
enjoyable
this
is
a
nice
drinkable
strong
ale
no
too
strong
to
down
a
couple
but
dont
let
them
creep
up
on
you
poured
thick
almost
syrupy
no
head
to
speak
of
color
is
a
murky
reddishbrown
slightly
clearer
at
the
edges
of
the
glass
smell
is
somewhat
dull
definite
scent
of
hops
a
hint
of
spiciness
taste
is
a
shockingly
strong
orange
at
first
with
aspects
of
pear
and
pomegranate
giving
way
to
a
spicy
hop
taste
and
mellowing
out
to
almost
a
smooth
creaminess
not
a
real
cream
taste
more
like
a
cream
soda
mouthfeel
is
slightly
oily
very
heavy
drinkability
is
ok
the
only
real
problem
is
the
oily
mouthfeel
though
i
could
see
this
being
a
positive
to
some
people
overall
while
im
not
sure
id
run
out
and
buy
more
if
offered
i
would
jump
at
the
chance
to
drink
this
beer
again
but
back
to
the
topic
stone
did
a
really
good
job
making
this
a
very
complex
beer
but
keeping
it
drinkable
kudos
i
thought
i
was
sophisticated
enough
to
enjoy
a
brew
like
this
but
i
tried
a
bomber
of
this
while
vacatining
out
in
arizona
since
i
cannot
recieve
this
in
il
yet
and
i
cant
really
say
i
like
it
too
much
going
on
caramel
fruit
overload
id
rather
have
an
eye
of
the
hawk
by
mendocino
pours
a
ruddy
dark
amber
with
a
small
head
hazy
the
smell
is
of
grapefruit
and
spicy
hops
tastes
spicy
grapefruity
and
piney
from
all
the
hops
long
finish
amore
grapefruit
at
the
end
a
little
raw
tasting
with
a
little
bit
lack
of
integration
the
mouthfeel
is
alittle
overcarbonated
and
a
little
thin
not
creamy
a
pretty
big
beer
and
nice
and
brawny
but
a
little
superficial
and
harsh
d
could
drink
this
all
day
one
of
my
favorites
drinkability
is
good
abv
is
not
even
too
terribly
high
only
downside
would
be
that
if
you
werent
planning
on
arrogant
bastard
all
night
youd
have
to
have
one
hell
of
a
beer
to
follow
this
one
with
i
believe
this
would
overpower
most
others
the
taste
is
an
excellently
balanced
sweet
malt
with
just
enough
rounded
bitterness
i
taste
caramel
malts
with
mellow
smooth
bitterness
beets
citrus
and
sweetness
my
only
critiques
i
might
wish
it
was
a
tiny
bit
more
carbinated
this
is
definitely
one
of
my
favorite
american
strong
ales
id
totally
buy
this
again
especially
during
the
summer
poured
from
a
22oz
bottle
dark
amber
color
almost
a
dark
ruby
when
back
lit
fluffy
offwhite
cream
colored
head
creating
a
mild
lace
down
the
glass
the
head
dissipated
after
a
while
smells
of
a
nice
malt
sweetness
mild
tones
of
caramel
and
a
light
hop
scent
hints
of
a
citrus
scent
hidden
in
the
back
ground
nice
nose
with
a
very
pleasant
and
distinct
aroma
the
taste
was
of
a
nice
well
rounded
malt
flavor
up
front
roasted
nutty
malt
flavors
followed
by
a
light
sweetness
on
the
tongue
mild
hop
bitterness
rounds
out
the
well
balanced
flavor
in
the
back
of
the
mouth
this
is
a
great
full
bodied
brew
great
rolling
flavor
from
start
to
finish
very
smooth
and
drinkable
again
another
well
crafted
and
tasty
brew
from
stone
i
am
glad
to
see
that
there
beers
make
it
to
the
other
side
of
the
us
i
wish
stone
beers
were
available
in
missouri
i
would
have
this
one
hand
all
the
time
appearance
deep
red
colour
with
a
creamy
white
head
smell
is
more
sweet
than
hoppy
which
surprised
me
taste
is
a
very
balanced
to
me
the
malts
and
hops
are
in
synchronicity
i
was
expecting
more
of
a
hop
blast
it
may
be
that
i
have
held
on
to
this
bottle
too
long
and
the
hops
has
subsidided
no
matter
still
a
classic
west
coast
beverage
or
it
the
lack
of
hops
could
be
due
to
my
mouth
being
hammered
into
a
submission
by
a
surly
furious
a
couple
of
hours
earlier
mouthfeel
is
rich
with
a
medium
to
low
carbonation
the
head
dissapated
quite
quickly
in
my
pint
glass
overall
it
would
be
a
staple
for
me
if
i
could
just
access
it
on
a
regular
basis
i
love
this
beer
as
a
strong
ale
a
rich
translucent
brown
in
color
with
a
tan
head
the
smell
that
initially
hits
your
nose
is
fresh
floral
hops
and
citrus
aromatics
the
taste
is
a
caramel
maltiness
up
front
with
a
long
lasting
intense
bitterness
at
the
end
fresh
wet
hops
are
present
throughout
as
it
warms
caramel
is
much
more
apparent
in
the
aroma
and
the
lingering
bitterness
is
much
less
than
i
remember
the
very
first
time
i
had
it
this
might
be
a
beer
that
some
people
have
to
get
use
to
for
a
while
this
beer
really
started
my
love
of
good
beer
i
first
tried
this
because
of
its
catchy
name
when
at
a
bar
in
college
i
have
always
been
and
will
always
be
infatuated
with
the
color
of
this
beer
the
head
takes
on
a
slight
amber
shade
and
the
beer
itself
is
such
a
unique
bright
amber
color
that
really
is
eye
catching
the
taste
is
amazing
plenty
of
hops
and
a
remarkable
complexity
pours
a
dark
reddish
brown
with
a
two
fingered
tan
head
belgian
lace
forms
on
the
glass
as
the
head
falls
sweet
pineapple
aroma
solid
wollop
of
hop
bitterness
up
front
with
some
alcohol
and
tingling
co2
and
dry
bitterness
in
the
finish
some
dry
grass
barley
taste
in
the
background
medium
mouthfeel
and
very
drinkable
does
not
do
an
adquate
job
of
showing
a
spectrum
of
hop
taste
just
bitterness
many
other
iipas
i
would
prefer
this
is
a
strong
solid
ale
that
is
strong
dark
copper
reddish
poir
with
a
tan
head
with
mild
retention
it
has
some
citrus
esters
as
well
as
a
nice
sweetness
coupled
with
good
hoppiness
the
taste
is
strong
robust
and
citrusy
with
malt
sweetness
a
bit
heavy
mouthfeel
and
adequately
carbonated
good
drinkability
though
it
can
sneak
up
on
you
sorry
but
i
cant
give
this
beer
a
better
rating
than
this
i
suppose
im
just
not
worthy
flame
away
but
really
its
a
lame
beer
with
a
great
marketing
strategy
at
least
its
a
well
made
lame
beer
moderate
mouth
that
has
weight
with
enough
carbonation
to
keep
it
lively
very
drinkable
for
such
a
hop
bomb
119
just
had
it
on
tap
yesterday
at
the
yard
house
in
scottsdale
wow
this
beer
is
incredible
one
of
the
strongest
yet
most
drinkable
beers
ive
ever
had
i
needed
to
edit
this
because
the
taste
is
crazy
grapefruits
as
soon
as
it
hits
your
tongue
all
the
way
until
you
move
on
to
the
next
beer
its
all
grapefruit
i
love
it
has
a
great
appearance
pours
almost
reddish
amber
drank
from
a
pint
glass
goes
down
smooth
and
leaves
a
pleasent
aftertaste
in
your
mouth
be
careful
though
this
smooth
drink
does
pack
quite
the
punch
i
went
through
four
glasses
of
these
very
quickly
another
great
beer
from
stone
hopefully
the
rumor
that
theyll
be
distributing
in
wisconsin
in
2007
is
true
so
i
can
have
these
more
often
good
stuff
its
a
very
good
offering
on
draft
however
i
think
i
could
only
drink
a
two
pints
of
this
at
most
would
tire
of
the
taste
after
that
would
highly
recommend
a
little
more
relaxed
than
served
from
the
bottle
this
is
one
beer
that
will
definitely
throw
off
your
senses
the
first
thing
i
smelled
was
a
semistrong
sweet
fruity
fragrance
that
resembled
some
sort
of
exotic
fruit
basket
it
pours
out
with
a
nice
thick
light
tan
head
that
is
a
good
contrast
to
dark
amber
red
body
of
the
ale
its
almost
like
the
picture
perfect
ale
however
its
mouth
feel
is
creamy
and
is
a
bit
rough
around
the
edges
but
its
not
harsh
and
its
has
a
great
malty
flavor
22oz
bomber
this
one
pours
a
bit
thick
there
was
a
bit
of
an
off
white
head
the
beer
is
a
bit
clear
and
a
reddish
amber
color
extremely
malty
with
a
nice
hop
afterbite
unique
taste
there
is
a
bit
of
fruitiness
in
there
it
is
very
potent
this
is
one
my
wife
will
definitely
not
like
i
am
worthy
seems
like
one
of
those
beers
that
keeps
growing
on
you
wish
i
had
another
bottle
a
must
try
beeralthough
it
seems
like
everybody
has
already
tried
this
one
the
beer
was
a
nice
ruby
red
with
tan
head
and
lacing
strong
aroma
of
grapefruit
and
sweet
caramelized
malts
taste
is
a
little
different
than
i
remembered
ive
got
strong
pineapple
and
citrus
hops
the
pineapple
surprised
me
overall
a
great
bold
flavor
than
is
still
fairly
drinkable
poured
a
deep
brown
with
a
nice
creamy
head
and
thick
lace
throughout
smell
has
a
definate
nuttiness
as
well
as
some
hops
smells
very
thick
taste
is
caramel
and
nutty
as
i
expected
from
the
smell
but
has
a
nice
dry
hopped
back
very
nice
and
smooth
leaves
you
wanting
more
this
is
a
definate
keeper
and
a
good
way
to
welcome
myself
back
home
from
vacation
cheers
high
abv
have
a
bomber
and
then
stop
if
you
have
not
tried
this
one
try
it
if
people
have
been
telling
you
you
would
like
this
one
you
will
i
felt
like
it
was
going
to
be
a
hoaxy
beer
because
of
the
name
and
the
price
which
was
nearly
3
dollars
for
the
bottle
at
cvs
but
this
is
a
legit
beer
try
it
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
a
34
dark
tan
head
over
the
clear
burgundy
red
brew
hearty
holds
on
well
with
ample
lacing
aroma
is
dominantly
hoppy
with
citrus
and
pine
powering
the
experience
taste
starts
a
bit
lacking
in
my
mind
not
as
richly
malty
as
i
would
expect
but
never
fear
the
hops
kick
in
a
take
over
with
bursts
of
bitterness
that
impress
without
making
you
cringe
from
overdoiung
it
mouthfeel
is
smooth
for
such
a
hoppy
offering
and
drinkability
is
dangerously
good
had
this
many
times
just
never
got
around
to
reviewing
reminds
me
why
i
keep
coming
back
hops
shake
if
you
will
this
is
another
killer
way
to
experience
the
massive
hop
profile
of
this
brew
great
a
hearty
rich
fullbodied
ale
with
balance
and
power
will
happily
drink
again
this
beer
poured
a
deep
brown
color
with
a
thick
creamy
head
that
lasted
quite
a
while
the
smell
is
sweet
and
inviting
the
taste
is
very
malty
with
a
noticeable
hop
finishbalanced
superbly
the
mouthfeel
is
full
and
leaves
a
nice
coating
on
the
tongue
that
serves
as
a
reminder
of
this
delicious
concoction
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
that
is
heavy
enough
to
know
you
are
having
a
real
beer
but
not
too
filling
to
keep
it
from
being
drunk
at
a
proper
pace
pours
a
dark
copper
color
and
is
semicloudy
head
is
about
a
half
an
inch
but
settles
down
to
a
lace
aroma
is
very
fruity
and
sweet
almost
like
candy
goes
down
smooth
tasting
like
grapefruit
and
is
very
bitter
it
is
pretty
well
carbonated
also
ive
got
mixed
feelings
about
this
one
it
says
its
a
strong
ale
but
could
almost
be
passed
off
as
a
double
ipa
i
kinda
like
the
fruity
taste
but
seems
pretty
bitter
for
a
strong
ale
this
is
the
second
stone
brew
ive
had
and
wasnt
impressed
with
the
first
it
seems
to
be
getting
better
after
the
first
few
sips
maybe
ill
have
to
review
this
again
sometime
drinkability
varies
based
on
tastes
stone
claims
to
have
a
brew
that
isnt
for
everybody
with
this
one
and
they
are
right
but
thats
why
i
like
this
beer
couldnt
have
more
than
a
couple
of
these
and
prefer
food
with
this
one
will
have
another
when
i
crave
it
the
drinkability
is
good
could
be
a
little
better
but
really
a
very
good
brew
prosit
mk
overall
the
nose
is
spellbinding
the
appearance
good
the
balance
of
hops
to
malt
seems
such
to
enliven
the
hops
but
to
not
let
it
get
overly
out
of
character
perfect
in
that
sense
the
finish
is
rich
with
flavors
but
i
would
have
liked
to
see
a
bit
more
complexity
on
the
foretaste
though
excellent
overall
drinkability
i
could
drink
this
and
only
this
for
the
rest
of
my
life
and
be
a
completely
happy
and
content
man
i
dont
think
i
can
say
that
for
any
other
beer
on
the
planet
in
other
words
the
drinkability
is
like
everything
else
about
this
beer
perfect
double
bastard
is
way
better
a
lot
of
this
guy
is
hype
enjoyed
this
a
lot
will
have
to
update
when
i
can
really
take
some
good
notes
double
bastard
is
next
overall
an
excellent
ale
worthy
of
all
the
hype
potent
and
drinkable
poured
out
a
dark
amber
bodym
slightly
red
clear
and
clean
off
white
head
is
big
thick
and
creamy
looking
and
lasts
a
long
time
the
nose
starts
with
citrus
hops
with
some
light
sweet
malt
thrown
in
the
taste
is
first
sweet
fruity
malt
blend
nicely
with
a
light
sweet
malt
backbone
then
some
snappy
hop
bitterness
nice
and
clean
and
refreshing
medium
bodied
with
good
carbonation
drinks
clean
and
refreshing
note
upon
further
review
i
realized
the
fruit
definetely
grapefruit
and
the
more
i
drink
this
beer
the
more
i
like
it
its
a
taste
explosion
at
7
2
abv
the
alcohol
was
hardly
detectable
although
the
hops
may
be
a
bit
hard
for
some
to
handle
this
beer
deserves
praise
for
coupling
malts
and
hops
in
such
a
unique
manner
what
a
great
beer
too
bad
you
cant
get
it
in
illinois
my
friend
jay
says
im
a
wussy
because
i
dont
drink
a
lot
of
good
beer
because
im
allergic
to
it
but
stones
arrogant
bastard
is
a
notable
exception
it
has
a
crisp
taste
that
goes
down
very
smooth
with
a
complex
flavor
not
unlike
my
last
three
girlfriends
the
flavor
and
the
color
can
vary
sometimes
also
like
my
girlfriends
bottom
line
very
solid
beer
a
lot
of
depth
and
quite
well
balanced
it
has
some
aggressive
hop
moments
but
it
always
manages
to
bring
them
back
into
balance
before
they
get
entirely
out
of
control
an
impressive
effort
the
drinkability
is
average
i
see
no
reason
to
drink
this
when
there
are
beers
that
are
much
less
offensive
that
have
a
true
style
to
them
by
far
the
worst
stone
beer
that
gets
the
most
press
and
praise
the
strong
ale
catch
all
is
just
not
a
solid
situation
i
prefer
structure
this
is
a
bit
messy
for
me
if
this
thing
were
about
14
abv
i
think
i
would
be
more
appreciative
of
it
because
i
could
forgive
some
of
the
harsh
abrasiveness
as
it
stands
it
tastes
like
a
monster
only
it
is
not
really
that
strong
considering
this
beer
has
a
great
name
i
wish
it
deserved
to
be
so
arrogant
though
i
think
some
people
have
been
punked
out
by
the
smack
talk
on
the
bottle
nice
jedi
mind
tricks
stones
other
products
are
much
more
deserving
of
the
praise
they
make
some
truly
stellar
beers
that
being
said
i
am
not
feeling
this
one
and
i
will
not
pretend
to
be
slainte
just
an
absolutely
fantastic
beer
the
high
gravity
makes
it
something
id
drink
occasionally
but
man
does
it
taste
great
wow
the
sweetness
of
this
beer
is
very
nice
i
can
taste
some
pineapplegrapefruit
and
some
nice
malt
flavors
coming
throught
the
finish
is
dry
with
some
of
those
great
west
coast
hops
really
shining
through
this
beer
sure
has
a
lot
going
on
i
think
this
might
be
one
of
the
best
beers
that
i
have
tried
pours
a
soft
yet
thick
head
with
good
retention
the
slight
beige
color
compliments
the
almost
dried
blood
color
of
the
beer
itself
the
beer
is
such
a
deep
garnet
that
i
had
too
hold
the
glass
up
to
the
light
to
see
the
bubbles
plenty
of
strong
hop
and
rye
flavors
hit
me
nostrils
immediately
the
flavor
reflects
the
smell
very
well
i
would
say
this
was
an
ipa
but
the
caramel
malts
and
other
unnameable
sweetness
pursuaded
me
otherwise
the
palate
is
strong
and
thick
with
bitterness
after
after
a
few
of
these
i
thought
i
should
rate
this
beer
from
the
bottle
poured
a
nice
garnet
with
a
tan
head
that
left
some
good
lacing
aroma
a
nice
citrus
mixture
of
oranges
lemon
tangerine
and
grapefruit
sugar
hops
grassy
flavor
all
that
nice
sweet
citrus
with
a
nice
bitterness
and
dryness
i
am
glad
that
i
can
now
buy
this
when
ever
i
want
d
i
must
say
im
not
worthy
but
a
bomber
or
two
would
be
quite
the
pleasure
overall
the
nose
is
spellbinding
the
appearance
good
the
balance
of
hops
to
malt
seems
such
to
enliven
the
hops
but
to
not
let
it
get
overly
out
of
character
perfect
in
that
sense
the
finish
is
rich
with
flavors
but
i
would
have
liked
to
see
a
bit
more
complexity
on
the
foretaste
though
excellent
overall
served
in
a
pint
glass
the
arrogant
bastard
pours
an
amberbrown
color
with
about
an
inch
thick
tan
head
good
lacing
too
the
aroma
is
of
sweet
malt
caramel
and
citrusy
hops
very
nice
the
initial
taste
is
malty
sweetness
and
then
has
a
good
bitter
hop
finish
with
a
bit
of
noticable
alcohol
warming
after
drinking
it
a
while
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumfull
bodied
and
its
very
smooth
drinkability
is
high
as
well
it
goes
down
easy
this
is
an
excellent
beer
thats
very
well
balanced
id
recommend
it
to
anyone
d
there
is
no
denying
that
this
beer
is
worthy
of
every
accolade
it
has
thus
received
from
all
other
raters
and
now
me
smooth
and
delicious
but
full
of
bold
and
assertive
flavor
as
well
as
alcohol
be
careful
this
beer
may
be
good
but
its
still
a
bastard
d
very
drinkable
for
a
beer
with
a
7
2
abv
one
of
my
faves
first
tried
this
beer
at
the
age
of
17
and
thought
it
was
absolutely
disgusting
how
things
change
a
truly
awesome
beer
at
least
the
name
will
scare
away
any
not
worthy
beer
drinkers
overall
a
very
graceful
and
gentle
ale
that
doesnt
reflect
its
name
at
all
dont
get
me
wrong
this
ale
can
throw
haymakers
with
the
best
of
them
but
im
very
impressed
with
its
remarkable
balance
and
pleasant
demeanor
im
very
glad
to
greet
stones
entry
into
the
michigan
market
with
open
arms
and
mouth
the
masterfully
showcased
hop
profile
in
this
beer
would
make
me
believe
it
was
an
ipa
ill
gladly
submit
to
this
strong
ale
any
day
this
is
an
awersome
beer
so
glad
there
is
distro
in
michigan
now
pours
a
deep
dark
garnet
in
color
with
an
excellent
and
very
thick
offwhite
head
and
lacing
that
never
ends
smell
is
dominated
by
big
floral
hops
with
hints
of
piney
hops
and
a
touch
of
roasted
malts
taste
is
damn
good
there
are
some
malts
up
front
but
they
are
quickly
overtaken
by
floral
hops
the
taste
is
much
like
an
ipa
but
more
subdued
and
balanced
nice
mouthfeel
with
a
medium
body
the
alochol
content
is
well
masked
drinkability
is
excellent
as
the
flavor
is
superbely
balanced
mouthfeel
is
good
not
overly
carbonated
but
the
drinkability
isnt
really
there
this
beer
could
be
an
excellent
brew
and
live
up
to
its
hype
if
it
was
just
smoother
and
not
so
uneven
but
thats
just
my
opinion
its
still
much
better
than
most
beers
out
there
poured
a
reddish
brown
color
with
a
white
head
leaving
a
little
lacing
smell
is
full
of
piney
hops
theres
definately
a
strong
malt
base
but
this
is
hops
all
the
way
taste
starts
a
little
sweet
with
some
caramel
but
is
quickly
full
of
piney
hops
pretty
good
medium
bodied
higher
carbonation
once
again
pretty
good
and
is
worth
a
try
i
really
enjoyed
this
brew
the
first
time
i
had
it
and
im
still
enjoying
it
after
drinking
it
many
times
aggressively
poured
a
three
inch
frothy
light
brown
head
w
a
cloudy
dark
amber
caramel
hue
the
head
last
throughout
the
drink
and
left
good
amount
of
lacing
the
aroma
was
outstanding
heavy
malt
caramel
and
a
moderate
piney
or
perfume
hop
although
this
brew
is
an
american
strong
ale
the
amount
of
hops
would
make
you
think
its
a
ipa
yum
finally
when
i
taste
it
began
w
a
moderate
sweet
caramel
and
had
a
long
lasting
heavy
citrus
hop
ending
the
bastard
has
a
nice
medium
body
watery
and
lively
feel
to
it
imo
this
brew
rocks
but
it
could
turn
many
drinkers
off
if
your
a
hophead
i
recommend
this
brew
enjoy
drinkability
i
discovered
this
gem
at
murphys
in
prescott
az
in
2000
i
saw
it
on
the
beer
list
and
thought
the
name
was
hysterical
so
i
had
to
order
one
i
quickly
realized
that
this
was
no
mere
novelty
beer
this
is
by
no
means
for
the
faint
of
heart
but
if
youre
up
to
it
i
think
youll
find
this
to
be
very
quaffable
for
a
brew
of
this
magnitude
let
me
just
say
right
now
this
review
may
be
a
bit
biased
my
beer
drinking
journey
started
with
this
beer
and
i
always
find
myself
coming
back
to
it
and
i
will
declare
right
now
stone
is
my
favorite
beer
company
thier
beers
are
not
for
the
timid
the
gargoyle
has
just
punched
me
in
the
nuts
a
few
times
but
of
course
he
helps
you
up
and
burshes
you
off
in
general
all
of
the
stone
beers
are
pretty
strong
and
this
one
started
the
tradition
i
think
well
anyway
on
to
the
arrogant
bastard
pours
a
dark
cherry
with
a
very
light
tan
head
that
stays
and
laces
very
well
the
smell
is
hops
alcohol
and
citrus
fruits
a
complex
tate
the
hops
jump
out
but
i
also
pick
out
peach
dark
fruits
fresh
bread
and
the
alcohol
sting
just
in
the
background
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
thick
but
enjoyable
not
a
chore
to
drink
at
all
at
least
for
me
i
could
drink
this
stuff
all
night
but
after
more
then
2
bombers
i
would
need
to
take
a
cab
as
i
said
before
stone
is
truly
one
of
my
favorite
beer
companies
and
i
always
love
trying
thier
special
releases
and
they
never
let
me
down
thier
beer
is
always
good
and
strong
this
beer
gave
me
an
appreciation
for
craft
beers
in
general
so
i
do
owe
it
somewhat
of
a
debt
never
a
bad
choise
but
if
your
looking
for
something
lighter
then
go
with
something
rogue
and
dont
mess
with
the
gargoyle
tastes
a
bold
hoppy
somewhat
bitter
roasted
caramel
malt
mouthfeel
is
excellent
bold
but
adequately
watery
with
just
the
right
carbonation
and
hoppy
afterbite
the
fruits
are
still
there
but
the
alcohol
taste
is
stronger
perhaps
a
little
too
strong
for
this
abv
but
im
already
sold
by
this
point
it
really
is
an
arrogant
bastard
good
beer
d
a
good
beer
under
the
right
conditions
a
great
beer
tonight
this
beer
was
hitting
me
as
a
little
too
bitter
and
sticky
a
bomber
took
a
long
time
to
finish
though
it
was
enjoyable
and
is
definitely
recommended
slight
thickness
in
the
mouth
but
defintely
not
chewy
just
enough
to
savor
the
flavor
definitely
a
worthwhile
brew
i
remember
trying
this
beer
years
ago
when
i
was
still
into
bmc
and
not
being
able
to
handle
all
the
flavor
its
great
to
look
back
and
see
how
this
is
the
epitome
of
craft
beer
in
how
much
really
goes
into
it
a
bastard
among
the
rest
this
one
speaks
for
itself
arrogant
bastard
ale
pours
a
dark
reddish
brown
with
a
thin
off
white
head
this
is
a
really
good
aromatic
beer
hops
dominate
the
aroma
but
there
are
esters
noticeable
too
taste
is
definitely
heavy
on
the
hops
but
the
malt
is
doing
a
fairly
good
job
of
balancing
it
out
there
is
an
estery
almost
metallic
flavor
near
the
end
this
was
an
older
sample
id
say
it
would
only
be
better
fresh
with
stronger
hop
flavors
what
a
fantastic
beer
id
had
this
a
couple
times
before
and
thought
it
was
good
but
not
this
good
i
guess
my
palate
has
developed
enough
that
i
can
truly
appreciate
it
this
beer
is
quite
common
in
my
area
so
i
tend
to
overlook
it
in
favor
of
more
exotic
options
thats
a
mistake
on
my
part
truly
a
great
beer
that
often
gets
overlooked
due
to
its
abundance
and
hype
marketing
tactics
aside
this
beer
kicks
ass
highly
recommended
drinkability
deceptively
easy
to
drink
dangerous

the

i
could
get

d
this
is
a

beer
youll
zip

before
you
know

im
glad
i
gave
this
another
shot
its
definitely
one
of
my
favorites
now
mediumbodied
mouthfeel
but
the
drinkability
suffers
due
to
the
strength
of
the
hops
although
not
nearly
as
bitter
as
the
ruination
ipa
this
is
definitely
one
for
the
hopheads
would
recommend
this
one
to
anyone
who
thinks
they
are
worthy
simply
put
one
of
the
best
most
complex
beers
i
have
ever
tasted
the
appearance
is
amazing
dark
ruby
redbrown
tint
with
a
caramel
colored
head
that
leaves
uber
belgianlike
amounts
of
lacing
and
never
dissipates
throughout
being
drunk
probably
has
the
best
head
retention
ive
ever
seen
out
of
a
pint
glass
the
smell
is
actually
pretty
sweet
not
bitter
like
the
bottle
and
company
suggests
very
cocoa
and
caramel
like
the
taste
is
the
amazing
part
the
7
2
is
very
well
hidden
leaving
you
to
actually
be
able
to
scarf
some
arrogance
down
fairly
fast
but
why
would
you
do
that
anyways
many
many
different
flavors
bombarding
your
mouth
at
once
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
heavy
but
not
sticky
which
is
perfect
for
me
creamy
once
you
get
to
the
head
in
fact
about
the
last
1
of
the
pour
is
pure
cream
awesome
drinkability
is
damn
good
for
how
strong
this
beer
is
there
are
just
so
many
good
aspects
its
amazing
everyone
must
try
this
gotta
love
the
bottle
too
rich
slightly
cloudy
deep
amberbrown
color
one
of
the
best
looking
beers
ive
seen
very
minimal
smell
very
smooth
with
a
perfect
amount
of
bitterness
what
i
liked
about
this
was
that
the
flavor
was
strong
but
at
the
same
time
extremely
drinkable
one
of
the
best
american
beers
ive
had
another
fine
offering
from
stone
this
is
a
beautiful
looking
beer
with
a
deep
redcopper
color
to
it
it
has
a
big
hop
aroma
too
very
citrusy
and
piney
these
people
must
love
using
cascade
chinook
or
perle
hops
it
has
a
slightly
heavy
body
but
is
definitely
drinkable
with
your
first
taste
you
get
the
wonderful
citrus
piney
hop
flavor
on
your
palate
and
then
it
mellows
out
and
the
bitterness
flows
through
leaving
a
nice
crisp
finish
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
to
drink
and
because
of
the
big
hop
flavor
you
dont
even
realize
it
weighs
in
at
7
2
hmmmm
a
nice
dark
reddish
golden
brown
with
a
woody
almost
earthy
scent
the
hops
certainly
can
pack
a
punch
this
time
around
the
aba
tastes
much
better
than
the
first
time
this
beer
toutched
my
unworthy
palate
after
some
taste
bud
assults
like
ruination
the
hops
in
this
beer
pale
in
comparison
but
still
stand
out
and
strongly
proclaim
i
am
here
a
hops
lover
will
like
this
beer
pours
a
dark
red
with
an
off
white
head
smell
is
mostly
hops
with
citrus
and
some
yeast
taste
is
bold
with
a
medium
body
mostly
hops
followed
by
some
citrus
characters
and
fruit
maybe
prunes
for
such
an
intimidating
label
the
taste
reminds
me
of
flowers
it
has
a
bitter
aftertaste
that
lingers
from
the
hoppy
presence
the
mouthfeel
is
ok
lots
of
carbonation
decent
balance
this
beer
is
strong
and
if
you
are
afraid
of
hops
then
stay
away
it
does
represent
a
potent
beer
but
the
label
got
me
amped
up
for
something
much
more
a
good
stone
offering
and
worth
checking
out
this
one
has
me
wondering
now
about
the
double
bastard
i
will
probably
try
that
one
soon
its
a
tasty
brew
but
ill
take
nosferatu
or
hibernation
ale
over
it
any
day
poured
from
a
22oz
bottle
into
my
pint
this
beer
was
a
dark
auburn
color
great
lacing
around
the
glass
long
lasting
frothy
head
the
first
smell
is
all
about
the
hops
nice
hoppypiney
nose
with
a
bit
of
maltiness
and
slight
alcohol
as
well
just
like
the
smell
the
first
sip
shouts
hops
very
hoppy
up
front
but
mellows
nicely
let
it
warm
it
gets
even
smoother
the
roasted
maltiness
and
carmel
also
nicely
round
out
the
profile
even
thought
this
is
a
smooth
beer
as
big
beers
like
this
go
you
can
definitely
taste
the
alchohol
which
is
a
good
thing
overall
you
must
try
this
beer
if
the
label
doesnt
scare
you
away
appearance
was
a
clear
dark
browncopper
color
which
formed
a
light
tan
head
of
decent
size
aroma
was
more
subdued
than
i
would
have
expected
primarily
hops
with
a
mild
grapefuitgrass
aroma
malt
is
fairly
represented
but
hops
is
primary
aroma
flavor
was
a
lightly
roasted
malt
well
balanced
by
the
hops
again
with
a
grapefruit
type
flavor
some
alcohol
was
present
but
not
excessive
light
to
medium
in
body
with
fairly
high
carbonation
the
alcohol
came
out
a
little
bit
more
as
a
warming
sensation
and
the
effect
of
the
beer
was
drying
overall
a
great
beer
which
was
highly
drinkable
a
very
good
brew
easily
drinkable
a
bit
thinner
than
it
could
have
been
but
still
aggressive
esp
in
the
mouthfeel
all
in
all
a
curious
brew
that
falls
between
classification
thus
an
american
strong
ale
i
would
recommend
at
least
giving
it
a
whorl
to
everyone
d
abv
is
so
well
hidden
hops
is
so
present
without
being
in
your
face
malt
and
sweetness
are
such
perfectly
subtle
balances
that
this
brew
is
an
easy
big
session
it
may
be
overindulgent
in
hindsight
but
i
could
definitely
see
this
luring
an
unsuspecting
participant
into
an
evening
affair
love
the
bottle
this
is
an
aggressive
beer
you
probably
wont
like
it
haha
this
is
a
great
gift
beer
if
you
really
want
to
rub
it
in
to
your
yellow
dishwater
drinking
friends
over
the
top
in
a
lot
of
ways
my
bottle
pours
a
slightly
murky
brown
color
with
some
glowing
red
highlights
thick
bubbly
tannish
head
and
great
retention
and
lacing
in
the
glassware
beautiful
streaming
carbonation
nose
is
aggressive
indeed
strong
hop
notes
piney
and
some
sour
citrus
this
is
balanced
by
a
thick
warm
malt
character
smells
terrific
and
in
no
way
simple
palate
is
likewise
both
thick
mouthcoating
caramel
malts
with
biting
resinous
hops
darting
around
complex
palate
that
is
so
very
complex
what
is
this
beer
falls
into
the
elusive
strong
ale
category
in
other
words
we
dont
know
what
it
is
but
its
something
to
be
reckoned
with
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
both
smooth
and
biting
aggressive
carbonation
and
a
lingering
hopbitter
finish
what
a
complex
creation
no
wonder
the
bottle
warns
that
this
beer
wasnt
created
for
the
sniveling
yellow
beer
drinking
wimps
this
is
the
liquid
equivalent
of
the
middle
finger
to
that
ilk
excellent
this
beer
is
like
a
dipa
with
a
lot
less
bittering
hops
and
thus
a
more
obvious
malt
profile
lots
of
aroma
hops
give
the
taste
of
a
highly
hopped
ale
but
in
reality
it
is
very
malty
i
love
it
and
frankly
i
dont
find
it
strong
at
all
this
is
an
awesome
beer
super
malty
with
a
very
nice
hop
ambiance
that
does
not
interfere
with
all
that
great
maltyness
but
just
lets
it
do
its
thing
a
serving
note
if
you
want
to
really
experience
the
flavor
and
aroma
of
this
beer
serve
room
temp
thats
true
of
most
beers
but
especially
this
one
if
you
serve
it
icecold
youll
miss
the
show
mouthfeel
drinkability
the
beer
is
full
bodied
the
beer
has
lingering
hop
oilyness
the
beer
is
pleasingly
complex
this
beer
was
oddly
very
smooth
on
draft
this
is
a
very
drinkable
bastard
i
dont
think
i
would
try
to
make
an
evening
with
arrogant
bastard
but
arrogant
bastard
is
a
great
beer
to
have
on
any
evening
highly
recommended
and
worth
the
high
price
mouthfeeldrinkability
light
carbonation
was
very
smooth
and
went
down
with
ease
could
drink
a
few
pretty
much
the
only
reason
i
bought
this
was
because
of
its
name
and
the
design
that
was
on
the
bottle
i
guess
you
could
say
im
a
sucker
for
their
marketing
scheme
the
arrogant
bastard
poured
out
a
brilliant
dark
shade
of
red
and
i
do
mean
dark
as
far
as
color
and
appearance
goes
this
is
one
of
the
prettier
beers
ive
ever
seen
i
could
definitely
smell
the
hops
on
this
one
along
with
something
else
that
could
maybe
be
described
as
fruity
but
the
hops
are
prevalent
for
sure
the
mouthfeel
was
a
very
pleasant
sensation
very
smooth
and
the
overall
taste
of
the
beer
is
like
a
swift
kick
to
the
taste
buds
it
comes
on
at
first
with
a
kind
of
sweet
taste
which
is
quickly
followed
up
by
all
the
hops
that
you
got
from
the
scent
on
the
whole
this
isnt
a
style
of
beer
im
particularly
fond
of
i
can
appreciate
it
for
a
beer
or
three
but
not
much
more
than
that
as
the
label
humorously
implies
this
one
aint
for
everybody
its
big
its
bitter
its
bold
its
brash
but
its
also
so
remarkably
well
made
and
well
balanced
that
its
my
opinion
that
anyone
who
considers
themselves
to
be
beer
lovers
must
seek
it
out
to
try
at
least
once
i
dont
believe
id
use
this
one
as
an
intro
to
craft
beers
for
a
devout
bmc
drinker
but
this
is
a
great
hook
to
sink
into
anyone
already
fishing
craft
waters
simply
put
its
beautiful
great
beer
this
is
an
intense
wellcrafted
complex
strong
ale
that
deserves
the
credit
it
gets
a
deal
at
3
49bomber
in
az
as
well
also
reminded
me
a
lot
of
bells
3rd
coast
old
ale
pours
a
lovely
dark
red
color
with
minimal
head
that
dissipates
quickly
and
leaves
a
trace
of
tan
lace
smell
is
very
floral
maybe
roses
and
something
sharp
that
hints
at
the
bitterness
to
come
taste
is
good
all
hops
no
malt
within
a
mile
of
this
one
the
first
taste
is
floral
maybe
pine
then
it
rounds
into
a
lovely
soft
licoricelike
roast
that
is
not
burnt
at
all
it
sort
of
lulls
you
into
complacency
and
then
the
bitterness
comes
on
like
a
freight
train
painting
the
back
of
the
tongue
with
a
burnt
coffee
sharpness
not
even
something
i
can
describe
as
aftertaste
so
much
as
a
oral
hangover
this
is
not
my
style
i
suppose
i
live
up
to
their
youre
not
worthy
motto
so
i
may
be
a
bit
jaded
mouthfeel
is
very
good
hits
a
good
balance
of
roundness
without
being
heavy
drinkability
low
low
low
low
i
cant
imagine
making
it
through
more
than
one
in
a
session
just
too
much
hops
all
in
all
probably
a
good
example
of
a
style
that
appeals
to
someone
other
than
me
poured
a
reddish
color
with
a
large
tan
head
that
stayed
around
and
left
a
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
was
citrusy
with
tons
of
sweet
malt
and
floral
hops
taste
of
bitter
hops
cherries
roasted
and
caramel
malts
with
bitter
grapefruit
flavors
on
the
way
down
thankfully
i
did
not
see
any
difference
in
bottles
brewed
at
the
new
facility
d
the
first
time
i
had
this
beer
i
thought
it
was
overwhelming
and
i
had
trouble
finishing
one
22oz
bottle
coming
back
to
it
after
having
tried
some
real
beer
i
find
it
an
irresistable
if
not
perfect
brew
and
it
will
be
in
my
fridge
quite
frequently
easier
to
drink
than
a
stout
but
not
quite
a
session
beer
d
this
is
a
very
easy
beer
to
drink
for
how
big
it
is
though
its
definatly
not
for
everyone
sophisticated
or
not
when
im
in
the
mood
for
a
beer
but
not
sure
what
im
in
the
mood
for
this
is
what
i
get
complex
yet
not
difficult
to
drink
or
enjoy
a
little
too
sweet
for
me
most
of
this
talk
is
rubbish
and
i
dont
care
one
of
the
best
beers
ill
ever
have
hazy
brown
amber
liquid
poured
gently
from
the
bottle
head
is
like
a
maniac
on
the
loose
3
fingers
in
width
nose
is
far
too
faint
for
my
tastes
pine
caramel
orange
and
butter
i
really
have
to
strain
to
make
out
these
scents
taste
is
massive
pine
burnt
caramel
diacetyl
and
pleasing
bitterness
at
the
tail
end
i
detect
some
pleasant
grain
mouth
is
perfectly
modertate
i
didnt
care
for
this
i
wasnt
worthy
the
first
several
times
i
tried
it
something
about
the
fruitiness
didnt
seem
to
mesh
with
the
caramel
i
had
no
such
issues
this
time
the
beer
is
very
enjoyable
and
drinkable
but
its
heavy
bitterness
will
probably
prevent
someone
from
drinking
too
many
at
once
a
very
noteable
beer
drinkability
it
seems
wasteful
to
drink
too
much
arrogant
bastard
its
so
powerfully
distinct
in
its
big
upfront
flavors
that
i
appreciate
it
best
in
the
context
of
other
beers
after
enjoying
an
ab
ipas
seem
crisper
english
bitters
seem
smoother
and
doppelbocks
seem
sweeter
eric
tastebuds
be
warned
this
beer
has
an
incredible
kick
for
true
hopheads
i
found
this
beer
on
tap
at
a
local
pub
poured
with
an
adequate
tan
head
that
left
small
amounts
of
lacing
on
the
glass
fresh
hops
on
the
nose
grapefruit
and
hop
resin
on
the
front
backed
by
a
rich
caramel
maltiness
finishes
clean
leaving
you
refreshed
good
by
itself
but
but
with
food
especially
something
that
has
alot
of
garlic
yum
pours
a
two
finger
dark
tan
head
over
a
semicloudy
rich
redrust
liquid
smells
mild
piney
hops
and
grapefruit
pith
touch
of
caramel
tastes
hoppy
bitter
with
nice
fruity
hop
flavors
and
a
nearly
equally
competing
malt
sweet
hop
flavor
is
oranges
and
grapefruit
pith
with
a
touch
of
tangerine
esters
are
peaches
malt
is
lightcolored
caramels
and
a
bit
of
smoke
which
may
actually
be
a
a
result
of
hop
grassy
character
thick
body
and
moderate
carbonation
not
the
arrogant
bastard
that
i
was
expecting
i
guess
in
todays
extreme
beers
this
one
just
falls
in
line
drinkability
was
quite
good
very
complex
but
not
so
much
so
that
you
need
to
drink
it
in
small
increments
full
body
but
not
heavy
exceptionally
smooth
carbonation
is
hardly
noticable
there
is
a
beautiful
contrast
between
the
velvety
mouthfeel
and
the
pine
hop
flavors
i
guess
im
worthy
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
arrogant
bastard
is
big
bold
and
beautiful
there
is
nothing
subtle
in
this
it
is
as
advertised
its
got
a
spot
as
stones
signature
beer
but
i
personally
like
the
ipa
and
ris
better
with
that
said
its
still
a
wonderful
beer
and
one
of
those
beers
im
always
recommending
for
people
looking
to
try
a
good
beer
to
see
what
all
the
talk
is
about
very
drinkable
cheers
i
bought
this
beer
for
my
birthday
back
in
december
and
am
just
now
getting
around
to
drinking
it
the
beer
had
a
fair
amount
of
head
and
is
a
deep
mahogany
color
the
smell
is
of
honey
and
hops
the
taste
is
pretty
aggressive
hop
bitterness
and
a
slight
alcohol
ting
highlight
this
brew
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
considering
the
higher
abv
the
drinkability
is
very
good
for
the
style
the
alcohol
is
there
but
in
a
very
inviting
way
this
is
a
bold
beer
certainly
one
i
will
try
again
woo
hoo
d
drinkable
hell
yes
stone
doesnt
dissapoint
with
this
arrogant
bastard
what
a
great
tasting
beer
interesting
beer
one
of
those
extreme
beers
that
many
go
for
i
tend
to
prefer
mine
a
bit
more
balanced
if
you
threw
in
some
more
malt
and
maybe
used
a
less
attenuative
yeast
youd
have
yourself
a
pretty
nice
barleywine
as
it
is
its
a
hoplovers
delight
drinkability
arrogant
bastard
definitely
lives
up
to
its
hype
ive
had
this
numerous
times
and
everytime
i
have
one
i
forget
how
good
it
is
those
big
piney
citrusy
like
hops
do
it
for
me
a
fantastic
bitterness
that
only
makes
you
want
to
drink
more
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
and
the
brown
sugar
sweet
malt
gives
ab
a
very
nice
balance
highly
drinkable
for
a
7
2
abv
one
that
i
will
always
come
back
to
a
true
classic
that
must
not
be
missed
it
tastes
great
but
it
can
be
hard
to
get
one
down
before
it
warms
up
and
excessive
esteriness
and
hops
come
out
for
being
pretty
strong
on
the
alcohol
content
this
is
a
fairly
easy
brew
to
consume
just
not
too
many
drink
this
one
carfully
or
else
itll
trick
you
first
thing
that
hits
you
is
the
strong
hop
aroma
along
with
a
very
toasty
carmel
malt
flavor
a
very
dark
red
color
medium
off
whitetannish
color
head
with
medium
carbonation
flavor
is
very
bitter
but
tends
to
leave
you
with
a
good
aftertaste
strong
but
goes
down
somewhat
smooth
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
tasted
to
date
not
one
for
drinking
in
large
quanities
one
to
be
enjoyed
slowely
at
the
end
of
a
very
long
day
drinkability
this
beer
is
so
good
i
like
to
drink
it
on
its
own
if
i
were
to
pair
it
with
food
the
food
would
have
to
be
very
flavorful
not
to
be
overpowered
it
looks
amazing
and
tastes
great
ill
take
this
any
day
i
fear
it
will
become
trendy
because
of
its
great
bottle
but
ill
always
know
why
i
like
it
this
one
is
too
damn
drinkable
i
found
myself
longing
for
another
even
with
the
extra
alcohol
arrogant
bastard
is
dangerously
easy
to
down
this
will
be
on
my
list
of
beers
to
seek
out
ive
looked
all
around
and
a
22oz
bomber
is
usually
3
99
to
5
29
this
is
just
a
great
beer
for
a
very
good
price
even
at
the
high
5
29
drinkabilty
very
good
beer
goes
down
easy
would
have
several
of
these
anytime
as
the
bottle
states
in
so
many
wordsthis
beer
is
not
for
the
weak
i
love
huge
beers
such
as
this
and
am
very
glad
i
had
the
opportunity
to
taste
this
one
some
who
are
not
impressed
by
this
beer
forget
or
never
knew
how
important
this
beer
was
in
convincing
other
brewers
that
there
was
a
market
for
bigger
beers
sure
there
are
big
beers
from
all
over
now
but
this
will
always
have
a
place
in
my
heart
and
my
fridge
and
its
bigger
younger
double
brother
will
always
have
a
space
in
my
cellar
great
marketing
though
def
makes
you
want
to
believe
that
you
like
it
otherwise
you
must
not
like
beer
nonetheless
this
is
a
great
beer
would
def
have
it
again
now
i
need
to
check
out
the
double
and
oaked
bastard
i
enjoy
the
beers

if
their
advertising
smacks
of
elitism
aba
is
a
very
nice
beer
and
it
is
made
even
better
as
it
is
widely
available
here
in
las
vegas
d
due
to
the
high
abv
i
wouldnt
recommend
this
as
a
session
beer
but
it
definately
is
great
if
you
want
to
take
the
edge
off

some

really
this
beer
has
a
reason
to
be
arrogant

finish

its
outstanding

surprisingly
drinkable
i
dont
know
how
good
os
a
session
beer
this
one
is
the
hoppy
flavor
although
good
is
a
little
overbearing
making
it
hard
to
enjoy
too
many
also
the
alcohol
content
is
just
a
little
high
this
beer
is
good
but
only
every
once
in
a
while
d
definitely
an
over
the
top
beer
that
is
enjoyable
but
it
just
seems
like
there
is
a
little
too
much
going
on
arrives
glowing
orange
against
the
sun
setting
off
in
the
distance
topped
with
1
of
sticky
whitish
head
head
lingers
for
quite
some
time
before
fading
leaves
amazing
lacing
all
the
way
down
the
glass
smells
of
hearty
hops
backed
up
with
with
loads
of
sweet
malt
a
hop
moster
but
a
balanced
hop
monster
chewy
in
the
mouth
and
light
on
carbonation
love
to
drink
it
but
it
is
a
workout
i
wasnt
sure
the
bastard
would
live
up
to
all
its
hype
but
it
didnt
disappoint
me
i
may
have
even
thought
a
bit
more
of
it
had
i
not
first
sampled
it
after
my
first
experience
with
fff
dreadnaught
what
a
divine
beer
if
stone
brews
were
available
in
my
home
area
i
would
definitely
make
this
one
a
regular
i
underestimated
this
brew
it
really
kicked
my
arse
this
beer
pours
a
rich
amber
color
with
a
thick
head
that
lingers
very
hoppy
aroma
bold
taste
with
hints
of
fruit
and
extreme
hoppyness
this
beer
makes
me
so
hoppy
good
carbonation
makes
this
beer
feel
good
in
your
mouth
leaves
a
bitter
aftertaste
which
is
nice
overall
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
if
you
can
get
your
hands
on
it
buy
it
you
will
be
impressed
arrogant
bastard
pours
a
deep
burnt
caramel
color
with
an
impressive
chunkyfoamy
tan
colored
head
aromas
of
fruitcake
pine
juniper
lime
zest
and
candied
fruits
soar
from
thy
glass
the
taste
is
rich
and
flavorful
having
a
warm
roasted
malt
and
bitter
hop
lipsmacking
interaction
that
is
truly
outstanding
dangerously
easy
to
quaff
the
embedded
natural
carbonation
creates
the
perfect
atmosphere
for
this
turboenhanced
brew
as
this
active
and
dense
carbonation
carries
itself
onboard
in
a
perfect
way
i
have
tried
a
few
of
stones
products
and
ive
always
felt
that
they
lacked
an
element
of
profound
complexity
this
ale
stands
out
as
my
favorite
to
date
having
many
more
layers
of
complexity
much
better
in
proportion
balance
and
just
a
better
synthesis
of
its
total
parts
creating
one
this
is
a
fantastic
presentation
of
the
style
perhaps
the
icon
its
a
good
looking
beer
nice
and
dark
rich
and
deep
red
color
in
the
glass
aroma
is
also
good
portending
a
solid
beer
taste
is
good
but
over
the
top
strong
in
the
hops
moderate
in
the
malt
and
way
too
bitter
mouthfeel
is
clouded
by
the
bitterness
due
to
its
extreme
nature
this
is
an
average
drinkability
at
best
in
related
news
i
love
stone
brewing
i
think
everyone
should
try
this
once
overall
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
a
must
try
i
go
back
and
forth
wether
i
like
this
or
ruination
more
rarely
does
a
beer
come
along
that
is
new
and
original
something
that
hasnt
been
done
yet
hoppy
and
bitter
alcoholic
and
deep
color
is
somewhat
amber
and
non
flattering
hiding
the
truth
head
holds
its
own
thru
the
entire
course
clear
redbrown
in
color
not
much
of
a
head
but
whats
there
sticks
around
pleasant
fruitysweet
aroma
lots
of
flavor
mollases
chocolate
and
toasted
maltiness
and
hops
too
rather
light
bodied
for
the
intense
flavor
clean
dry
finish
this
one
packs
a
punch
while
being
very
smooth
nice
and
dangerous
overall
i
wouldnt
drink
this
again
but
i
think
that
people
who
like
this
style
of
beer
would
like
it
won
this
bottle
in
a
bet
pours
red
and
clear
with
a
white
foamy
head
vaguely
sweet
malt
odor
with
some
metallic
hop
smell
not
all
that
impressive
on
the
nose
very
tasty
caramel
hops
quite
bitter
and
sweet
come
citrus
flavors
coming
through
too
grapefruit
and
oranges
and
a
nuttiness
too
syrupy
mouthfeel
an
extrememly
enjoyable
beer
from
stone
ill
remember
the
hops
and
the
thick
malty
caramel
feel
truely
delicious
and
extremely
drinkable
nice
looking
rubybrown
body
with
a
good
solid
offwhite
head
and
lacing
the
smell
was
elusive
as
i
noticed
a
few
different
things
but
couldnt
place
anything
precisely
i
think
my
nose
is
going
bad
on
me
the
taste
revealed
a
strong
toasted
malt
flavor
to
the
point
where
i
second
guessed
that
i
was
drinking
a
stout
but
then
the
hops
smacked
me
awake
fruitiness
some
souring
on
my
tongue
that
i
didnt
mind
good
all
around
really
i
am
a
big
fan
of
stone
brews
but
i
have
not
got
around
to
reviewing
many
of
them
arrogant
bastard
has
not
been
one
of
my
favorite
of
the
stone
lineup
but
it
is
very
good
to
say
the
least
i
am
drinking
this
from
a
22oz
bomber
in
a
pint
glass
it
pours
a
deep
mohagany
with
a
nice
tan
head
that
last
for
a
litte
while
ab
has
a
very
nice
aroma
with
hints
of
roasted
malt
and
and
grapefruit
hoppiness
the
flavor
is
aggressive
with
a
good
bit
of
hops
upfront
and
nice
malt
middle
with
a
slight
hint
of
belgian
candied
sugar
it
has
quite
a
bit
of
bittering
hops
in
the
end
and
aftertaste
the
aftertaste
is
a
little
harsh
due
to
the
bitterness
and
a
small
amount
of
alcohol
warming
which
effects
the
drinkability
ab
has
a
nice
medium
body
and
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
if
you
are
into
aggressive
beers
this
a
very
solid
beer
from
stone
but
my
favorite
of
the
lineup
is
still
ruination
bottom
line
good
but
not
great
im
just
an
oldschool
guy
and
the
overthetop
ibuflooded
bitterness
is
just
not
for
me
i
love
the
fact
that
a
stone
exists
and
that
theyre
willing
to
push
the
envelope
but
for
me
the
defining
factor
of
a
great
beer
is
balance
and
harmony
while
arrogant
bastard
offers
that
in
its
wonderfully
inviting
strong
but
not
overpowering
aromasweet
and
citrusy
that
i
pegged
as
grapefruit
at
first
but
then
became
more
mangolike
with
a
very
pleasant
floral
hop
backgroundthe
flavor
is
just
too
bitter
as
the
beer
warms
the
complexity
begins
to
come
out
in
the
background
but
its
still
dominated
by
the
raw
even
harsh
bitterness
of
the
excessive
hopskind
of
like
a
good
piece
of
music
being
overpowered
by
the
bass
being
turned
up
way
too
high
if
only
the
bittering
hops
were
turned
down
allowing
some
of
the
sweetness
of
the
malt
to
come
through
this
would
truly
be
a
great
beer
or
maybe
it
really
is
a
great
beer
and
im
just
not
worthy
this
is
one
beer
you
dont
want
to
serve
to
cold
or
else
you
will
lose
a
large
amount
of
flavor
good
crisp
finish
nice
beer
drinkablity
a
very
nice
beer
good
mix
of
hops
and
bitter
the
mouthfeel
makes
it
easy
to
drink
one
of
my
first
american
craft
beers
always
worth
a
drink
a
local
dive
has
this
on
tap
for
3
bucks
what
more
is
there
to
know
my
nonic
is
filled
with
a
nice
ruby
brown
liquid
with
about
one
and
a
half
inches
of
thick
dense
light
tan
head
i
find
the
aroma
has
more
of
a
sweet
malt
character
with
citrus
and
floral
hops
coming
in
at
the
end
the
taste
is
excellent
spicy
fruity
a
bit
sweet
in
the
beginning
with
a
touch
of
smokiness
to
it
bitterness
from
the
hops
come
in
upon
swallowing
with
a
smooth
slick
slightly
thick
mouthfeel
it
just
fills
your
mouth
full
of
goodness
thanks
stone
the
pleasure
was
all
mine
always
a
good
choice
for
me
i
just
wish
stone
would
sell
them
in
12oz
bottles
great
lakes
nosferatu
comes
in
12oz
and
is
really
similar
to
arrogant
bastard
if
anyone
is
looking
for
a
comparison
fairly
strong
in
the
large
bottle
so
i
guess
not
the
most
drinkable
beer
in
the
world
but
certainly
something
i
was
glad
to
have
22
oz
of
overall
this
was
a
great
beer
i
doubt
that
i
would
ever
order
it
again
but
it
was
great
to
order
once
it
was
pretty
freakin
intense
but
at
the
same
time
mild
the
bottle
was
oversized
for
this
beer
i
would
have
wished
for
a
smaller
bottle
the
bigger
bottle
forced
me
to
feel
as
if
i
needed
to
drink
it
i
am
looking
for
someone
to
beer
mail
me
directing
me
to
a
book
or
placethat
can
teach
me
more
about
appreciating
beer
full
of
flavor
but
not
so
overwhelming
that
youre
ready
to
move
on
to
something
else
after
one
this
beer
would
have
been
all
5s
if
it
would
have
been
a
bit
easier
to
drink
the
hop
bitterness
really
lasts
throughout
and
destroys
your
pallate
but
it
is
worth
it
without
question
one
of
my
top
5
of
all
time
drinkability
this
beer
is
clearly
not
for
everyone
it
is
not
a
beer
you
would
give
to
a
man
or
a
woman
dying
of
thirst
or
an
aficionado
of
american
swill
to
me
it
is
awesome
to
others
i
dont
know
served
from
a
22
oz
bomber
the
second
pour
in
to
a
goblet
reveals
a
thick
deeplycolored
lasting
head
similar
to
brasserie
des
rocs
grand
cru
the
hoppy
finish
and
slight
alcohol
taste
was
also
more
apparent
on
the
second
serving
if
only
the
supply
lines
in
pa
were
better
established
mouthfeel
is
incredibly
creamy
considering
the
bubbles
i
saw
in
the
beginning
i
wouldnt
drink
this
every
day
its
so
unique
that
it
strikes
me
as
a
specialoccasion
type
thing
but
wow
its
delicious
somewhere
between
a
malt
liquor
a
double
ipa
an
old
ale
and
a
barleywine
this
is
another
fantastic
beer
from
the
creative
freaks
at
stone
long
may
they
brew
d
i
wish
i
get
this
more
often
but
stone
hasnt
arrived
in
florida
yet
if
i
can
get
a
regular
supplier
of
this
i
will
buy
more
than
2
bottles
nest
time
overall
a
very
good
beer
side
note
this
ales
name
and
bottle
humor
me
the
same
way
kanye
west
humors
me
they
are
both
just
so
full
of
themselves
and
i
find
both
to
be
very
funny
this
is
the
type
of
beer
that
is
so
deep
it
is
hard
to
actually
pin
point
the
individual
tastes
in
a
good
way
you
almost
taste
something
new
with
each
and
every
sip
onto
the
reviewi
served
this
from
a
22
oz
bomber
into
a
snifter
it
poured
a
dark
deep
amber
garnet
on
the
edges
a
finger
of
dense
beige
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
few
minutes
before
subsiding
to
a
scattered
cap
some
decent
bits
of
lacing
left
behind
on
the
glass
nose
has
a
nice
dose
of
citric
hops
as
expected
but
there
is
also
a
strong
malt
with
hints
of
caramel
dark
fruits
and
brown
sugar
taste
meets
expectations
starting
with
a
nice
full
caramel
malt
some
toasted
and
nutty
flavors
detectable
and
then
giving
way
to
a
nice
long
bitter
citrusy
lemony
hop
finish
very
nice
certainly
hop
heavy
but
this
beer
has
the
malt
backbone
to
keep
up
full
bodied
with
a
very
nice
smooth
mouthfeel
this
is
an
incredible
beer
a
huge
american
beer
that
is
nonetheless
tasty
and
drinkable
if
youve
acclimated
yourself
to
hops
i
wish
i
didnt
have
to
travel
across
state
lines
to
get
stone
beers
i
love
this
beer
it
is
the
most
flawlessly
balanced
beer
ive
tried
some
might
say
its
a
little
hop
forward
maybe
thats
what
makes
it
balanced
to
a
hophead
like
me
nice
big
frothy
head
with
good
lacing
the
head
does
completely
dissappear
the
aroms
has
lots
of
maly
and
hops
ai
bit
different
than
other
strong
ales
eventhought
eh
alcohol
is
only
7
2
its
very
apparent
i
plan
on
cellaring
some
of
these
for
a
year
or
so
this
beer
is
just
all
around
cool
like
if
the
fonz
made
homebrew
hed
make
this
i
enjoy
this
every
time
pours
thick
carmel
colored
almost
looks
like
iced
tea
smells
sweet
and
delicious
so
many
characteristics
i
dont
know
where
to
start
grapes
malt
hops
and
caramel
the
taste
is
smooth
and
creamy
with
hops
malts
caramel
and
honey
this
is
a
stellar
beer
and
i
would
put
this
beer
up
against
any
other
and
be
on
top
i
now
understand
and
deem
myself
worthy
thank
you
stone
brewing
does
it
make
me
an
arrogant
bastard
to
consider
myself
worthy
22
ounce
bottle
loads
of
caramel
with
tons
of
hoppy
nose
upon
first
sip
very
caramel
flavors
and
very
high
spicy
bitterness
this
beer
is
exceptionally
clear
with
a
amber
to
red
color
very
nice
tight
white
head
excellent
mouthfeel
and
top
notch
finish
pours
out
an
offred
leathery
brown
color
with
few
bubbles
to
be
found
in
the
body
head
is
kind
of
small
beige
and
leaves
rings
of
lace
on
the
glass
malt
aromas
have
a
little
bit
of
chocolate
and
toasted
grain
while
the
hops
lean
towards
resin
alcohol
is
a
little
to
prominent
in
the
nose
for
me
flavor
is
of
the
toasty
malts
lots
of
fruity
esters
reminding
me
of
the
their
porter
and
a
big
finish
of
hops
grassy
floral
and
earthy
with
a
pronounced
aspirin
bitterness
that
lingers
on
for
a
while
mouthfeel
is
smooth
on
carbonation
it
is
almost
to
the
point
of
being
thick
but
doesnt
carry
too
much
weight
in
the
mouth
solid
overall
drinkability
d
again
rather
average
a
good
tasty
ale
but
no
complexities
this
large
bottle
poured
out
a
reddish
brown
color
with
a
thin
head
that
quickly
dissappears
the
aroma
is
of
hops
and
more
hops
as
well
as
pine
and
citrus
the
taste
is
also
hoppy
and
citrusyand
i
guess
if
this
is
your
favorite
styleyou
will
like
this
beer
as
for
myselfi
think
it
is
a
little
too
hoppy
and
while
i
thought
it
was
good
i
guess
i
was
expecting
more
i
suppose
i
am
not
worthy
a
really
great
and
special
beer
decent
mouthfeel
its
best
feature
and
fairly
drinkable
ive
had
one
now
probably
not
again
and
certainly
not
for
4
75
plus
tip
for
a
pint
the
scent
of
this
one
is
enough
to
love
and
the
flavor
leaves
me
wanting
more
high
alchole
makes
this
not
the
most
drinkable
but
it
is
much
more
enjoyable
than
i
remember
cheers

that
i
could
really
compare
this
to
but
why
try
anyways
this
one
is
simply
great
after
a
bomber
of
this
i
felt
great
the
effects
of
this
beer
seem
to
stick
with
a
little
longer
than
most
alll
in
all
a
great
beer
definatly
worth
a
try
and
on
my
top
five
list
a
heart
felt
thanks
to
bashiba
for
getting
this
bastard
to
me
bottom
line
it
is
so
choice
i
highly
recommend
it
if
you
have
the
means
overall
a
wonderful
beer
ive
only
ever
had
one
or
two
22s
at
a
time
but
i
think
i
could
drink
this
all
night
if
i
were
inclined
to
shell
out
the
bartender
poured
it
into
a
plastic
pint
and
got
about
a
halfinch
head
off
the
tap
dark
color
almost
black
smelled
great
had
some
hops
and
something
else
in
there
cant
put
my
finger
on
it
taste
is
great
this
is
definitely
my
favorite
american
strong
ale
hoppy
flavor
with
some
smokiness
overall
a
great
beer
i
like
to
get
at
least
one
of
these
everytime
i
head
to
skippers
a
very
complex
and
tasty
ale
definitely
not
for
tasteless
fizzy
yellow
beer
drinkers
and
is
always
one
of
my
favorites
ill
drink
to
that
overall
i
hate
the
fact
so
many
people
can
go
and
pick
this
up
at
their
local
store
and
its
taken
me
2
years
to
get
my
hands
on
a
bottle
this
is
one
that
i
could
drink
pretty
often
depite
the
ripyourtongue
out
flavor
great
beer
i
still
dont
think
im
worthy
i
love
the
taste
of
this
but
the
hops
can
get
a
little
overbearing
after
a
while
a
bomber
of
this
is
plenty
overall
a
good
beer
will
drink
again
drinkability
when
i
first
had
this
preba
i
couldnt
even
drink
this
it
was
too
strong
for
me
at
that
time
and
now
i
can
drink
this
once
in
a
while
if
i
wanted
to
if
i
have
another
one
i
will
make
sure
to
have
a
glass
of
water
sitting
next
to
me
after
i
finish
this
beer
great
drinkability
for
a
big
beer
i
find
this
beer
to
unbalanced
and
unimpressive
i
looks
good
enough
other
than
that
isnt
all
that
great
i
have
no
problem
with
agressive
hops
in
fact
double
bastard
is
one
of
my
favorites
because
it
is
more
balanced
however
the
lack
of
sweetness
to
balance
the
strong
hop
profile
of
arrogant
bastard
leads
to
a
very
undrinkable
beer
overall
a
good
beer
very
smooth
with
good
taste
despite
what
the
bottle
says
you
are
worthy
poured
a
brown
amber
with
a
beautiful
white
head
aroma
has
a
spicy
hoppiness
powerfully
flavored
with
smashing
hops
upfront
which
slides
into
deep
rich
malitness
the
sweetnessbitterness
combination
is
amazing
aftertaste
is
pleasantly
bitter
an
excellent
strong
ale
with
an
abv
at
7
2
it
is
alot
easier
to
take
than
bigfoot
but
with
all
the
flavor
you
could
want
i
wish
this
came
in
six
packs
cheers
overall
definately
strong
and
bitter
throughout
but
has
nice
flavor
profile
not
for
the
novice
but
enjoyable
for
the
experienced
if
you
could
carbonate
alpha
acids
this
is
what
it
would
taste
like
truly
fantastic
but
not
for
the
nonbeliever
an
aquired
taste
to
say
the
least
i
look
at
the
label
again
at
the
gargoyle
snarling
and
hoisting
a
mug
at
me
should
i
have
used
a
mug
like
he
knew
this
would
all
happen
wow
this
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
allows
the
head
to
foam
freely
impressive
aroma
of
grainy
malt
much
like
a
scotch
ale
the
flavor
is
unique
i
find
it
hard
to
place
my
finger
on
it
but
thick
stickysweet
malt
mixed
with
a
bit
of
roated
quality
very
close
to
the
taste
of
a
scotch
ale
whiskeylike
upfront
bite
the
taste
is
the
highlight
of
this
brew
one
of
a
kind
the
mouthfeel
is
full
and
sticky
not
too
many
of
these
in
any
one
sitting
the
drinkability
suffers
from
the
same
and
the
fact
alcohol
isnt
light
i
enjoyed
this
brew
and
will
look
for
it
in
the
furture
i
was
also
plesantly
surprised
by
the
taste
drinkability
hoo
mama
so
conflicted
the
delicious
aroma
keeps
me
chugging
this
bomber
but
im
pretty
sure
i
wont
be
having
a
second
this
is
a
moderately
drinkable
beer
certainly
not
an
everyday
kind
of
beer
and
i
wouldnt
want
to
have
more
than
a
couple
in
a
session
it
is
a
very
complex
and
challenging
beer
i
would
certainly
have
it
again
and
probably
will
drinkability
is
very
high
ab
is
far
too
easy
to
drink
always
a
joy
to
have
another
classic
from
stone
well
what
a
treat
man
the
head
on
this
was
incredible
for
me
nice
and
frothy
and
it
sat
for
awhile
it
looks
biege
sp
clouds
sitting
on
top
of
a
amberredish
sunset
the
taste
was
very
malty
almost
barleywine
like
to
me
for
some
reason
was
expecting
some
more
hops
in
it
but
dats
ok
shell
be
back
another
all
around
a
pretty
decent
beer
at
decent
price
that
i
can
groove
to
goes
down
smooth
but
it
is
very
complex
and
agressive
this
one
is
very
complex
and
more
flavors
come
out
as
it
warms
up
too
bad
this
is
so
hard
to
find
near
me
because
i
would
love
to
make
it
a
regular
pours
chocolately
brown
with
a
thick
tannish
head
very
visually
appeally
smells
great
malts
hops
and
barley
are
most
prominant
but
i
detect
a
slight
citrus
scent
tastes
strong
with
hops
and
roasted
malts
this
ale
is
something
that
i
would
buy
on
a
regular
basis
to
drink
at
parties
etc
very
affordable
for
as
superb
as
it
is
as
well
this
is
a
very
drinkable
and
tasty
beer
poured
a
dark
rubyamber
color
with
a
large
off
white
head
the
head
shrunk
down
to
a
12
inch
and
lingered
for
a
good
while
smell
was
good
some
citrus
but
mostly
a
malttoasted
malt
smell
for
some
reason
i
was
expecting
a
hops
blast
from
this
beer
but
i
must
have
missed
something
somewhere
the
predominant
taste
is
malt
but
not
a
chalky
strong
malt
taste
this
is
a
somewhat
sweet
caramel
malt
taste
very
balanced
and
very
nice
the
mouthfeel
is
rich
and
smooth
i
did
not
taste
any
raw
alcohol
at
all
left
some
moderate
lacing
on
the
glass
knowing
this
was
7
2
abv
and
served
in
a
22
oz
bottle
i
would
respect
this
and
drink
slowly
however
i
would
have
no
problem
accepting
a
second
one
48
oz
of
anything
is
about
my
sessions
limit
anyway
this
is
a
very
drinkable
and
tasty
beer
overall
a
tasty
brew
but
im
a
little
surprised
at
all
the
really
high
ratings
basically
this
reminds
me
of
an
overhopped
anchor
liberty
ale
drinkability
terrible
its
a
quality
beer
for
sure
but
just
too
relentlessly
hoppy
bitter
should
maybe
be
called
bitter
bastard
certainly
a
musttry
but
i
dont
think
ill
be
having
this
again
unless
you
like
the
taste
of
metal
you
probably
wont
take
it
past
your
first
try
good
for
the
experience
though
what
novice
beerfan
could
resist
that
bottles
appeal
ive
resisted
reviewing
this
beer
in
order
to
gain
perspective
over
time
and
multiple
bottles
this
beer
scared
me
at
first
shocked
me
later
finally
after
multiple
bombers
of
this
over
the
last
couple
years
ive
gained
a
real
appreciation
for
this
strange
brew
it
has
a
totally
unique
hop
profile
that
jacks
your
veritable
jaw
with
pine
hop
flavor
the
malt
holds
up
to
the
immense
hops
with
little
problem
very
well
rounded
despite
the
earthshaking
hops
and
notable
alcohol
content
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
excellent
creamy
head
strong
hop
aroma
from
flowers
to
earthy
scents
the
first
taste
has
a
little
bit
of
barley
there
then
bam
the
hops
come
right
out
and
announce
their
presence
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
rich
but
is
still
very
smooth
going
down
leaving
a
nice
dry
finish
overall
this
beer
backs
up
the
label
aggresive
the
intense
hop
flavor
make
this
a
must
try
beer
defnitely
a
favorite
poured
from
a
22oz
bomber
with
a
nicely
written
label
pours
a
rich
dark
cherry
color
that
is
amber
at
the
edges
thin
off
white
head
falls
quickly
to
light
lacing
that
sticks
to
the
glass
as
i
drink
aroma
is
sweet
and
malty
with
some
floral
and
citrus
hoppy
notes
present
as
well
smells
of
caramelmolasses
and
slight
hints
of
alcohol
sting
the
nose
appropriately
tastes
rich
and
hoppy
nice
malting
holds
it
all
together
very
well
balanced
with
a
bit
of
a
bite
present
in
the
tail
from
the
7
2
abv
mouthfeel
is
exceptionally
smooth
and
slick
goes
down
great
with
a
perfectly
matched
level
of
carbonation
making
this
brew
very
drinkable
would
definitely
seek
out
again
very
well
done
beer
i
love
it
this
drinks
a
lot
like
a
barleywine
with
a
little
less
mouthfeel
and
sweetness
the
hops
play
a
lead
role
but
the
subtle
malt
is
still
detectable
and
has
quite
a
bit
of
complexity
a
nice
warming
midwinter
brew
for
those
of
us
who
dont
live
in
canow
if
we
could
just
get
our
frostbitten
little
michigan
mitts
on
it
on
a
regular
basis
a
great
offering
from
stone
poured
from
a
bottle
this
dark
amber
ale
has
a
firm
but
lacy
head
that
settles
quickly
hops
dominate
the
aromy
with
citrus
overtones
i
loved
the
sweet
upfront
taste
and
the
bitter
bite
of
the
aftertaste
but
the
sustaining
mouthfeel
left
me
wanting
more
a
great
bold
flavor
just
comes
up
a
little
short
in
body
probably
not
a
great
session
beer
but
well
worth
a
taste
decent
drinkability
for
the
abv
although
as
i
mentioned
before
very
inyourface
which
i
think
hurts
its
drinkability
somewhat
call
me
a
sissy
if
you
wish
p
if
youre
used
to
drinking
the
common
beers
of
the
big
3
millerbudcoors
dont
try
to
broaden
your
experience
with
this
stuff
because
it
will
probably
turn
you
off
but
if
youre
reading
this
review
youll
be
fine
just
below
the
arrogant
bastard
ale
on
the
bottle
you
see
the
quote
youre
not
worthy
and
they
were
right
i
was
not
worthy
before
i
became
a
beer
advocate
one
of
my
absolute
favorites
and
not
just
because
of
the
marketing
though
i
am
a
whore
for
stones
attitude
hopefully
this
will
be
available
everywhere
soon
enough
converting
the
curious
into
the
truly
arrogant
quite
carbonated
nicely
warming
abv
is
apparent
but
this
is
not
the
big
scary
beer
it
makes
itself
out
to
be
next
to
a
big
a
ipa
for
instance
it
faints
away
still
its
one
i
drink
on
a
fairly
frequent
basis
i
ordered
another
one
first
off
i
remember
drinking
this
beer
a
few
years
ago
before
my
love
of
beer
began
and
thinking
it
was
absolute
rubbish
really
disgusting
this
is
my
dads
favorite
beer
and
he
always
has
a
case
of
22oz
bottles
out
in
his
beer
fridge
after
trying
this
again
today
i
am
so
glad
i
have
the
palate
to
appreciate
what
stone
is
doing
here
poured
into
what
stone
calls
their
way
cool
glass
it
is
pretty
cool
actually
a
deep
rich
caramelized
amber
with
a
lingering
sticky
head
and
amazing
staying
power
nose
is
very
aromatic
and
complex
with
the
expected
sweet
caramel
malts
and
over
the
top
hops
but
unexpectedly
a
distinct
fruity
profile
as
well
strawberries
taste
is
intense
and
as
the
label
warns
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
or
the
macro
swill
drinking
sissy
the
overthetop
hop
profile
will
definitely
weed
those
folks
out
however
this
is
actually
a
fairly
balanced
recipe
the
malts
are
very
well
done
and
full
of
sweetness
which
is
present
upfront
and
then
are
blown
away
by
the
fruitjuicy
fresh
hop
taste
and
texture
only
to
come
back
again
for
the
finish
which
leaves
you
smacking
your
lips
with
a
slightly
cloying
sweetness
really
a
complex
and
robust
beer
worthy
of
the
praise
it
recieves
i
will
continue
to
try
the
beers
recommended
by
ba
this
one
was
just
not
for
me
yet
this
poured
a
deep
reddishcopper
hue
with
a
clean
clear
body
it
had
a
small
head
which
left
very
nice
lacing
about
the
glass
its
aroma
about
knocked
me
over
plenty
of
hops
and
sweet
fruits
piney
caramel
roasted
malts
the
taste
was
much
of
the
same
but
balanced
excellently
with
a
barrage
of
sweet
caramel
and
roasted
malts
up
front
fading
into
a
spicy
bitter
hop
finish
i
can
not
emphasize
enough
the
complexity
and
balance
of
this
beer
since
i
had
it
in
the
larger
bottle
and
the
abv
is
decently
high
and
the
tastes
are
in
your
face
i
wouldnt
try
to
polish
off
more
then
one
or
two
of
these
in
one
sitting
plus
if
you
do
youre
not
savoring
and
enjoying
this
beer
which
is
exactly
what
you
shuold
do
truly
worthy
of
its
stellar
rating
pours
with
a
short
golden
head
that
is
well
retained
over
time
the
color
is
a
deep
copperbrown
and
the
beer
has
good
clarity
nice
lacing
and
plenty
of
active
carbonation
is
noticible
the
aroma
is
of
grassy
hops
with
a
faint
nuttiness
but
it
doesnt
eminate
too
strongly
strong
hoppiness
is
tasted
immdeiately
but
wait
there
is
a
nice
carmel
sweetness
on
top
of
it
to
balance
it
out
the
finish
is
crisp
and
bitter
but
not
overdone
mouthfeel
is
rich
and
full
with
a
good
feeling
of
carbonation
very
well
balanced
very
drinkable
unless
you
dont
like
bitterness
when
its
this
good
its
alright
to
be
arrogant
this
wasnt
my
first
one
and
it
wont
be
my
last
so
its
pretty
drinkable
i
do
usually
tend
to
switch
to
something
a
little
sweeter
after
one
of
these
though
i
think
its
the
cherry
flavor
that
makes
me
want
to
go
sweet
after
a
pint
of
this
somewhat
drinkable
beer
in
spite
of
the
name
dont
be
afraid
just
a
little
skeptical
ive
heard
great
things
from
stone
and
this
might
be
the
first
brew
of
theirs
that
ive
had
i
look
forward
to
trying
more
from
this
brewery
d
i
mark
it
down
a
bit
here
because
22
oz
of
this
mighty
hoppy
beer
was
maybe
a
bit
more
than
i
wanted
im
not
quite
the
hophead
as
some
others
i
may
be
back
for
more
but
probably
not
frequently
beautiful
ale
but
any
more
than
two
its
time
for
a
nap
a
must
for
hopheads
nothing
special
in
the
appearance
dark
amber
about
a
cm
of
head
lots
of
lace
faint
hops
with
some
complexity
in
the
nose
this
beer
is
all
about
the
taste
i
get
immediate
sweetness
good
natural
honey
like
sweetness
then
some
citrus
hop
taste
capped
off
by
some
intense
hoppiness
its
the
hops
that
make
this
beer
i
dont
know
enough
about
hop
types
to
distinguish
the
types
but
i
know
that
i
like
them
i
like
them
a
lot
no
no
i
love
them
this
is
an
aggresive
in
your
face
kick
your
ass
beer
the
strength
and
complexity
of
the
taste
actually
hurts
the
drinkability
but
i
still
recommend
this
for
everyone
to
try
you
may
try
it
and
love
it
or
you
may
hate
it
but
i
think
we
can
all
conclude
that
arrogant
bastard
is
truth
in
advertising
arrogant
bastard
is
easily
one
of
my
favorite
beers
when
i
realized
ive
never
gotten
around
to
writing
a
review
i
thought
it
would
be
fitting
that
ill
most
likely
earn
my
mug
with
this
review
this
bastard
is
a
deep
amber
it
has
fairly
good
clarity
and
a
thick
tan
head
forms
from
the
pour
the
aroma
is
powerful
resplendent
with
piney
hops
and
an
overriding
maltiness
that
seems
easily
to
be
the
equal
of
the
hops
the
taste
is
a
wonderfully
complex
interplay
of
malty
sweetness
and
hoppy
biterness
the
hops
provide
a
piney
oiliness
that
coats
the
tongue
and
creates
an
almost
mouth
puckering
effect
this
is
cut
rather
quickly
by
the
huge
malt
base
that
exists
and
all
of
a
sudden
i
cant
figure
out
whether
the
overriding
taste
is
bitter
or
sweet
during
the
swallow
the
alcohol
provides
a
bit
of
a
burn
down
the
throat
and
warms
the
stomach
this
beer
is
truly
an
experience
the
aftertaste
mostly
hops
lasts
well
after
the
swallow
due
to
the
mouth
coating
feel
of
the
beer
very
sticky
and
chewy
the
drinkability
isnt
great
due
to
the
stickiness
and
intense
flavors
the
22oz
bottle
is
plenty
still
its
a
beer
i
would
never
turn
down
i
mentioned
earlier
one
of
my
favorites
the
interplay
bertween
sweetness
and
bitterness
is
truly
amazing
taste
hoppy
with
grape
notes
i
was
really
blown
away
with
how
good
this
beer
tasted
i
could
have
drank
this
all
night
but
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
will
creep
up
on
you
be
careful
if
you
are
not
drinking
this
at
home
drinkability

its
high
abv
makes
it
slightly
less
drinkable
but
its
complexity
and
taste
make
it
super
desirable
mdr
mouthfeel
is
solid
with
perfect
carbonation
that
is
ever
present
like
scrubbing
bubbles
not
harsh
but
smooth
if
you
can
believe
i
can
drink
this
until
i
fall
like
a
fresh
cut
tree
way
to
go
stone
thank
you
sir
may
i
have
another
drinkability
hides
the
7
2
abv
well
i
could
easily
imbibe
several
of
these
in
an
evening
thoroughly
pleasing
massively
hospitable
and
pure
in
its
flavor
and
smell
a
fine
drinking
engagement
i
would
recommend
to
anyone
who
fancies
a
fine
beer
drinkability
dont
know
how
much
of
this
i
could
drink
in
one
night
but
i
would
definetly
come
back
to
this
beer
in
the
future
it
is
a
fine
beer
to
sit
back
and
watch
football
with
malty
sweetness
with
a
stinging
carbonation
and
a
hoppy
bitter
aftertaste
taste
not
as
balanced
as
the
aroma
hops
are
a
little
too
aggressive
for
me
as
the
label
warns
guess
im
not
worthy
drinkability
in
my
opinion
this
is
one
of
the
most
complex
and
tasty
brews
thats
very
widely
available
in
the
u
s
it
can
certainly
kick
your
ass
so
its
not
something
to
mess
around
with
but
with
a
good
meal
or
as
a
sipper
its
tough
to
beat
this
brew
id
like
to
cellar
some
in
the
future
to
see
what
happens
and
i
certainly
will
eventually
drinkability
listed
as
an
american
strong
ale
but
what
does
that
mean
this
is
a
big
dark
ale
very
hoppy
and
pleasing
so
if
the
asa
designation
is
a
catchall
for
strong
ales
that
cant
be
pigeonholed
this
is
what
i
would
want
from
one
of
those
beers
thanks
to
px2grafx
while
it
does
a
decent
job
of
living
up
to
its
own
selfprofessed
aggression
it
manages
to
still
be
a
wellbalanced
highly
drinkable
beer
obviously
not
something
i
would
drink
all
night
unless
the
ability
to
stand
was
not
a
priority
but
wow
i
definitely
want
to
get
my
hands
on
more
of
this
drinkability
i
should
have
bought
the
sixpack
instead
of
just
the
bomber
i
was
expecting
strong
floral
citrus
hops
which
i
now
love
and
didnt
quite
get
it
worth
a
pint
but
not
a
6er
or
case
this
is
a
beer
that
is
so
meticulously
crafted
that
its
brilliance
makes
it
seem
simple
and
is
truly
a
satisfying
drink
maybe
a
bit
too
much
alcohol
and
kamikaze
hops
for
binging
but
i
can
attest
that
having
one
with
lunch
is
close
to
nirvana
notes
ive
wanted
to
get
my
hands
on
some
stone
brews
for
a
long
time
and
finally
did
on
a
thanksgiving
trip
to
dc
definitely
enjoying
this
one
i
dont
think
id
be
too
interested
in
drinking
multiple
bottles
of
this
in
a
row
its
just
too
rough
alcoholic
and
pricey
and
as
far
as
i
know
it
only
comes
in
22
oz
bottles
this
beer
feels
good
on
the
palate
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
and
feels
heavy
on
the
palate
the
level
of
carbonation
is
low
which
is
in
my
opinion
appropriate
to
the
style
it
is
not
a
beer
that
can
be
chugged
rather
it
has
to
be
drunk
over
time
its
a
great
brew
to
sit
down
and
enjoy
this
beer
is
really
a
gem
one
of
the
best
brews
i
have
ever
had
ill
always
respect
the
bastard
and
will
always
find
myself
coming
back
to
this
brew
again
and
again
it
is
definitely
worth
the
money
and
a
try
go
ahead
and
see
if
youre
worthy
i
cant
wait
to
try
this
again
overall
arrogant
bastard
has
lived
up
to
the
hype
it
is
one
great
and
incredibly
tasty
beer
if
only
i
could
get
it
in
nebraska
overall
absolutely
wonderful
asa
very
near
perfect
in
every
way
excellent
aroma
and
flavor
fruity
hoppy
bitter
with
just
enough
sweet
to
carry
it
through
one
of
my
absolute
favorites
from
stone
notes
this
was
a
great
way
to
relieve
some
stress
due
to
an
extremely
hectic
week
thank
you
stone
keep
up
the
good
work
like
samiclaus
without
the
huge
kickyourass
abv
absolutely
a
top
ten
beer
hugely
complex
near
perfect
balance
drink
it
or
quit
drinking
period
note
since
it
has
been
said
a
few
times
that
this
brew
has
a
sweet
after
taste
i
may
try
another
this
may
not
have
had
proper
storage
and
the
gargoyle
may
have
fail
to
ward
off
the
bitterness
what
an
excellent
creation
stone
hath
wrought
i
have
had
this
beer
bottled
and
enjoyed
it
immensely
i
decided
to
hold
off
on
the
review
until
i
could
find
it
on
tap
it
pours
a
cloudy
tan
head
with
a
deep
amber
color
with
a
tinge
of
orange
this
beer
smells
bittersweet
it
has
a
very
deep
floral
scent
and
multiple
layers
of
hops
the
hops
definitely
do
not
match
the
color
of
the
beer
the
smell
prepares
you
for
the
hoppy
bang
you
get
from
your
first
sip
it
has
a
fantastic
kick
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
with
the
malt
gently
balancing
it
at
the
tip
of
the
tongue
the
tongue
is
lightly
coated
before
it
kicks
you
this
is
a
very
hoppy
very
potent
beer
i
would
only
recommend
this
to
people
who
love
hops
and
would
advise
them
not
to
rate
any
beers
for
awhile
after
having
this
one
because
the
hops
dominate
your
tastebuds
for
awhile
dark
auburn
with
creamy
tan
diminishing
head
snekks
if
malt
hops
and
a
fruity
tone
the
taste
is
very
malty
with
strong
enough
hops
to
balance
the
heavy
malt
and
alcohol
many
things
going
on
in
this
beer
good
brew
im
going
to
crack
open
one
more
same
consistancy
this
is
good
stuff
i
dont
think
that
i
would
be
able
to
note
the
flavor
or
nose
of
another
beer
right
after
this
one
try
it
have
an
open
mind
and
buy
other
beer
just
incase
alcohol
is
present
but
not
overbearing
the
best
strong
ale
ive
ever
had
this
one
will
be
residing
in
my
fridge
this
winter
very
pretty
dark
black
strong
ale
from
the
fabled
stone
line
of
brews
smell
is
of
currants
raisins
and
alcohol
taste
is
of
dark
chocolate
molasses
and
more
alcohol
very
bitter
lingering
aftertaste
which
strikes
down
the
drinkability
all
in
all
a
very
very
nice
brew
in
moderation
pours
a
dark
brown
color
but
is
still
translucent
with
minimal
carbonation
and
a
tancolored
head
that
has
good
retention
and
is
rather
thick
i
detect
a
lot
of
malt
some
yeast
and
some
dried
fruit
aromas
very
interesting
and
appealing
the
taste
is
complex
and
rich
with
a
hoppy
bitterness
upfront
followed
by
a
strong
malt
presence
a
bit
of
warming
alcohol
sensation
as
well
the
aftertaste
is
sour
and
lingers
longer
after
each
sip
a
bit
of
astringent
taste
over
time
in
the
back
of
my
throat
a
very
good
beer
that
is
enjoyable
but
the
aftertaste
reduces
the
drinkability
in
my
book
one
of
stones
best
brews
drinkability
i
thought
it
went
down
easy
fans
of
hoppy
bitter
neers
may
not
enjoy
this
it
comes
in
large
bottles
22oz
and
is
7
2
abv
so
you
might
not
want
to
drink
too
many
at
one
sitting
pours
a
dark
ruby
amber
with
good
clarity
the
dense
two
finger
head
is
tan
in
color
holds
well
and
leaves
slight
lacing
fresh
whole
hops
and
roasted
barley
nose
alcohol
is
present
in
the
aroma
and
taste
but
not
in
an
estery
or
astringent
way
big
toasted
malt
flavor
upfront
followed
by
a
very
assertive
herbal
hop
bitterness
that
will
dry
then
gracefully
fade
a
touch
harsh
towards
the
end
but
the
full
body
and
low
carbonation
allow
a
slight
residual
sweetness
from
the
malt
that
evens
the
bitter
and
dry
hop
finish
the
abundance
of
hops
and
solid
malt
profile
create
an
aggressive
flavor
that
is
not
overwhelming
but
perfectly
balanced
and
deeply
satisfying
drinkability
well
this
a
huge
beer
big
alcohol
content
really
bitter
i
am
not
worthy
of
more
than
2
or
maybe
3
in
a
sitting
overall
definitely
try
it
if
you
havent
i
wouldnt
necessarily
seek
it
out
again
but
would
certainly
accept
one
if
it
came
across
my
path
this
beer
has
definetly
brought
beer
to
a
new
level
and
changed
my
whole
way
of
thinking
about
beer
its
in
my
top
three
thanks
to
px2grafx
for
the
bottle
way
past
due
that
i
finally
tried
this
one
uf
it
may
be
an
unpopular
opinion
but
this
beer
is
a
bit
of
smoke
and
mirrors
i
am
afraid
or
is
it
emperors
new
clothes
d
i
could
drink
this
beer
all
day
and
all
night
long
until
i
dropped
to
the
ground
because
im
not
worthy
poured
a
very
slightly
hazy
reddish
copper
with
a
mediumsized
light
tan
frothy
slowly
diminishing
head
with
a
decent
amount
of
complex
lacing
the
smell
is
a
little
odd
but
in
a
good
way
i
guess
i
was
expecting
the
heavier
hop
aromas
which
are
definitely
there
herbal
juicy
and
piney
but
i
wasnt
expecting
such
a
huge
malt
presence
its
lightly
medicinal
without
being
offputting
the
taste
is
huge
but
excellently
balanced
the
chewy
sweet
malts
are
counterbalanced
by
the
stinging
bitter
hops
wonderfully
i
love
the
caramel
flavor
in
there
and
the
finish
is
very
long
very
bitter
and
lightly
astringent
it
has
a
mediumfull
body
slightly
oily
texture
and
a
soft
carbonation
very
good
all
around
and
i
really
enjoyed
finally
getting
to
try
this
thanks
to
ds
in
pittsburgh
the
great
balance
and
true
arrogance
of
the
beer
make
it
quite
memorable
definitely
worth
seeking
out
drinkability
is
a
little
lower
just
because
of
the
high
alcohol
content
and
the
boldness
of
the
brew
a
bomber
will
suffice
in
fact
it
was
taking
me
a
little
while
to
finish
the
thing
kudos
to
stone
for
this
fantastic
and
confident
brew
this
lives
up
to
the
excellent
text
on
the
back
of
the
bomber
its
complex
and
while
i
appreciate
it
i
dont
see
myself
making
this
a
real
fridge
regular
its
definitely
got
potential
to
compete
with
the
iipas
in
my
diet
though
and
as
a
sort
of
indulgence
to
my
inner
geek
it
succeeds
quite
well
drinkability
the
22
will
go
down
fine
but
anything
after
that
would
be
overkill
d
this
was
a
bomber
split
three
ways
and
that
was
more
than
enough
this
is
a
very
bold
beer
that
doesnt
need
more
than
one
serving
to
get
its
point
across
the
arrogance
of
the
gargoyle
who
adorns
the
bottle
which
ive
had
but
not
reviewed
and
the
tap
handle
is
appropriate
and
its
true
throughout
this
beer
not
just
the
taste
but
everything
that
really
goes
along
with
this
beer
arrogant
bastard
is
not
for
everyone
its
probably
too
big
to
for
many
tastes
but
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
i
like
it
a
lot
but
trying
a
beer
of
this
nature
which
has
garnered
a
sort
of
mythical
following
is
worth
trying
for
anyone
the
only
pretense
to
balance
in
this
beer
is
that
both
the
malt
and
hop
bills
are
overthetop
thank
you
stone
deep
red
in
colour
with
a
lasting
slightly
off
white
head
fairly
low
carbonation
lots
of
hoppy
aroma
to
this
one
grapefruit
pine
earth
although
slightly
more
restrained
than
i
had
expected
for
an
aggressive
beer
its
actually
fairly
well
balanced
flavors
of
caramel
malts
some
minor
roasted
malt
notes
more
citric
hop
notes
and
a
bit
of
a
tealike
tannic
note
too
its
bitter
enough
to
balance
everything
out
but
not
over
the
top
a
full
bodied
example
of
an
american
strong
ale
a
huge
advantage
to
this
one
is
the
fact
that
you
can
buy
it
at
damn
near
any
convienience
store
on
the
west
coast
big
ups
to
stone
for
making
that
possible
this
is
a
great
beer
while
ive
had
this
ontap
many
times
ive
never
actually
bought
a
bottle
of
it
before
i
may
have
to
do
that
more
often
pours
a
deep
dark
brownishruby
offwhite
head
is
thick
at
first
but
settles
down
after
a
few
sips
from
the
glass
sweet
aromas
of
cinnamon
and
caramel
different
taste
than
i
expected
after
the
smell
hops
dominate
up
front
but
are
quickly
rounded
out
by
the
sweet
maltiness
overall
a
damn
good
brew
many
complexities
and
layers
to
this
one
and
at
only
3
per
deucedeuce
i
will
be
purchasing
this
one
pretty
frequently
second
half
of
this
bomber
now
and
this
is
really
beginning
to
grow
on
me
and
to
think
next
year
ill
have
i
think
access
to
this
in
nc
a
dark
reddish
brown
ale
capped
with
a
thick
frothy
sticky
tan
head
that
laces
like
some
kind
of
goo
aroma
contains
maltiness
caramel
some
toffee
and
a
faint
smell
of
something
that
i
can
only
describe
as
fivepound
nutty
christmas
fruitcake
the
taste
is
big
juicy
and
meaty
wth
bitter
grapefruit
rind
hops
asserting
themselves
after
the
creamy
and
caramelly
malt
blast
with
a
slight
tingle
of
warming
alcohol
at
the
end
got
some
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
there
too
and
it
lingers
even
after
a
bite
of
edam
the
mouthfeel
is
rich
creamy
and
certainly
big
this
is
one
toughass
brew
and
its
almost
overwhelming
at
times
i
was
in
the
mood
for
this
today
but
im
not
sure
id
go
for
it
on
a
regular
basis
nonetheless
topnotch
stuff
and
absolutely
worthy
of
such
selfproclaimed
arrogance
wow
this
one
is
flavorful
lots
and
lots
of
hops
thrown
into
what
would
normally
be
a
very
malty
beer
i
like
that
though
its
different
taste
is
pretty
full
thick
and
overwhelming
id
suggest
drinking
only
one
in
a
sitting
well
when
it
comes
to
ales
this
one
is
indeed
an
arrogant
bastard
and
only
tolerable
in
small
doses
pours
a
dark
amberred
color
an
off
white
head
rises
and
dissipates
quickly
but
this
beer
leaves
some
of
the
stickiest
lacing
ive
ever
seen
strong
smell
of
hops
but
it
is
balanced
with
caramel
malt
smell
my
initial
taste
impression
was
that
this
is
too
sweet
but
that
quickly
changed
to
wow
what
a
great
balance
of
powerful
hops
and
huge
malt
taste
the
bottle
says
that
you
are
not
worthy
im
glad
i
didnt
listen
mouthfeel
is
nice
with
a
smooth
dry
finish
the
high
abv
shows
through
slightly
at
the
end
moderate
carbonation
level
that
dosnt
distract
from
enjoying
the
feel
of
this
on
the
tongue
you
certainly
wont
sit
down
and
drink
3
or
more
of
these
in
a
sitting
but
i
could
enjoy
one
of
these
every
night
i
highly
recomend
beermanbrianaug
30
which
this
beer
reeks
of
even
still
be
careful

another
winner
from

i
get
the
sense
that
they
trial
run
beers
for
years
because
when
they
release
a
beer
it
is
refined

very

offering
with
a
nice

alongside
bigtime
overhopping
although
this

splendid

on

with

pine

it
is
not

drowning
out
the

rereviewed
after
tasting
this
on
draft
at
obriens
in
san
diego
last
week
just
a
totally
different
beer
even
better
hints
of
maple
and
a
little
whiskey
peatiness
come
through
hops
and
malt
seem
even
better
balanced
fanfriggintastic
it
poured
a
great
clear
amber
with
a
nice
tan
head
the
aroma
was
very
strong
and
consisted
of
hops
over
burnt
malt
it
was
simple
but
effective
it
had
a
strong
hop
taste
with
burnt
malt
in
the
background
the
feel
was
oily
with
an
extremly
dry
finish
i
happened
to
be
in
irvine
for
a
few
days
and
decided
to
take
the
opportunity
to
find
an
ab
and
sample
it
i
found
mine
at
the
yardhouse
and
it
was
worth
the
effort
the
beer
definately
was
well
put
together
and
would
be
a
hallmark
for
its
style
the
amount
of
hops
would
always
put
this
on
my
alternate
list
though
sip
and
chug
your
way
through
23
of
a
bomber
then
kick
back
and
let
it
warm
up
as
it
warms
up
you
should
find
yourself
contemplating
all
the
naughty
things
you
want
to
do
to
satisfy
your
lover
sip
the
last
third
of
this
brew
saying
those
things
with
your
eyes
this
is
a
mcnasty
beer
that
will
have
its
way
with
you
and
you
should
share
that
feeling
definitely
not
a
beer
for
the
general
masses
but
what
do
they
know
i
love
this
stuff
pours
out
a
clear
chestnut
hue
a
rich
garnet
when
held
to
the
light
damn
sexy
thick
creamy
offwhite
head
impressive
retention
with
a
tight
cap
almost
all
the
way
down
a
tight
wall
of
lacing
also
forms
down
the
glass
the
nose
starts
off
with
intense
grapefruit
rind
hops
the
malt
gasps
for
breath
as
it
quickly
surfaces
only
to
be
drowned
in
the
hop
goodness
once
again
almost
a
bready
malt
presence
as
fleeting
as
it
is
the
flavour
is
initially
a
smackdown
of
intense
hops
and
grains
wrasslin
with
one
another
and
you
get
so
caught
up
in
the
action
it
becomes
pointless
and
far
too
distracting
to
begin
breaking
down
the
action
into
an
anal
playbyplay
you
are
simply
swept
along
for
the
ride
a
rich
meaty
malt
becomes
more
apparent
as
the
beer
warms
up
nearly
toasted
and
caramel
making
the
gladiators
easier
to
distinguish
farther
down
the
glass
the
flavour
becomes
more
complex
but
you
get
so
caught
up
in
the
action
that
it
takes
a
microbiologist
to
create
a
spreadsheet
for
you
to
break
down
all
the
subtle
moves
and
combinations
into
a
discernable
mode
of
operation
after
a
quick
glance
at
the
spreadsheet
you
are
impressed
but
proceed
to
throw
it
over
your
shoulder
in
order
to
fully
appreciate
what
is
going
on
without
being
beaten
over
the
head
with
the
details
the
flavour
is
duelling
it
out
enough
as
it
is
the
mouthfeel
is
rich
and
velvety
and
very
inviting
considering
the
extremes
of
the
flavour
a
plush
welcome
mat
that
you
want
to
use
as
a
bath
towel
after
stepping
out
of
the
hot
tub
with
a
few
frisky
members
of
your
preferred
gender
of
attraction
i
want
more
of
this
stuff
and
i
want
it
now
i
was
a
total
mudskipping
retard
for
only
grabbing
one
bottle
of
this
in
my
travels
like
that
annoying
dog
in
the
taco
bell
commercials
its
time
to
make
a
run
for
the
border
ill
pay
the
duty
required
for
a
box
of
this
stuffgimme
gimme
gimme
the
mouthfeel
is
just
the
way
i
like
it
wonderfully
smooth
body
with
just
the
right
about
of
carbonation
so
it
goes
down
easy
drinkability
is
good
on
this
one
as
well
i
could
see
myself
having
a
few
bastards
with
no
problem
i
only
wish
stone
was
available
in
illinois
arghhh
a
great
ale
that
i
hope
i
will
have
the
chance
to
indulge
in
many
times
in
the
future
muchas
gracias
to
blitheringidiot
for
the
opportunity
to
prove
myself
worthy
smooth
silky
mouthfeel
with
excellent
low
carbonation
which
seems
to
suit
this
beer
perfectly
this
is
a
very
easy
beer
to
drink
and
is
enjoyable
from
start
to
finish
glad
i
finally
got
my
hands
one
edit
ive
since
changed
my
mind
about
the
bastard
its
bumped
up
from
good
beer
to
kick
ass
beer
i
think
maybe
i
was
looking
for
some
sort
of
crazy
intense
taste
when
i
tried
it
the
first
time
and
therefore
overlooked
the
fact
that
this
is
an
incredible
awesomely
balanced
beer
with
a
bite
and
i
definately
do
crave
it
frequently
in
contradiction
to
what
the
original
review
says
go
git
it
an
excellent
beer
to
server
with
meals
this
is
a
powerful
brew
and
a
joy
to
drink
for
me
it
a
beer
to
enjoy
occasionally
but
one
i
look
forward
to
savoring
the
magnum
hops
are
a
delight
for
the
hop
lovers
the
aroma
was
rich
and
pungent
the
malty
background
is
smooth
the
head
was
minimal
the
color
was
warm
brown
and
inviting
drinkability
is
low
by
design
i
think
theres
a
lot
to
this
beer
and
most
of
it
is
in
your
face
stone
could
pee
in
a
bottle
hop
it
up
and
i
would
probably
drink
it
their
beer
are
nothing
if
not
extraordinary
read
the
bottle
first
the
copy
sends
shivers
of
apprehension
up
your
spineam
i
worthy
as
it
turns
out
yes
pours
a
beautiful
garnet
color
with
a
lingering
head
and
tons
of
lacing
on
my
goblet
malt
and
hops
fight
it
out
for
the
nose
an
immediate
punch
in
the
mouth
of
hops
raisens
moist
fruit
cake
port
very
complex
and
intense
i
savored
every
drop
like
all
dank
beers
it
should
be
drank
cellar
temp
i
have
a
few
of
em
stashed
in
the
cellar
cant
wait
to
see
what
time
does
to
this
stone
potion
this
was
my
first
stone
beer
and
i
finally
understand
all
of
the
comments
about
how
extreme
they
are
from
a
22
oz
bomber
bottle
it
poured
a
beautiful
mahogany
color
one
of
the
best
looking
colors
ive
seen
very
clear
with
a
small
head
that
remained
in
some
capacity
throughout
the
drink
and
left
nice
lacing
as
i
drank
from
the
fridge
the
aroma
was
slightly
sweet
with
a
big
citrus
punch
and
the
smell
of
new
carpeting
anyone
else
get
that
beermail
me
as
it
warmed
more
malty
aromas
became
evident
raisins
brown
sugar
fresh
bread
the
taste
at
first
nearly
knocked
me
on
my
ass
i
wasnt
ready
and
mabye
not
worthy
as
the
bottle
suggests
for
what
i
experienced
the
first
taste
started
out
slightly
sweet
and
all
of
a
sudden
my
tongue
was
blasted
with
a
bitterness
ive
never
experienced
before
it
stayed
with
me
for
longer
than
any
other
bitter
taste
in
my
life
cold
from
the
fridge
this
thing
is
a
hop
monster
and
seemingly
nearly
out
of
balance
as
it
warms
it
really
starts
to
come
to
life
though
it
gets
sweeter
and
fruitier
and
either
the
bitter
hops
begin
to
fade
or
you
just
get
used
to
the
punch
they
pack
im
still
not
sure
either
way
this
is
a
very
complex
and
balanced
but
to
the
extreme
beer
mouthfeel
is
medium
carbonation
medium
bodied
smooth
and
creamy
really
nice
i
knocked
it
down
a
notch
on
drinkability
because
the
flavors
are
so
extreme
that
it
can
be
challenging
to
drink
and
the
high
abv
starts
warming
you
up
pretty
quickly
i
drank
the
second
part
of
this
bomber
alongside
a
bowl
of
really
spicy
cajun
no
tomatoes
jambalaya
which
contained
andouille
sausage
chicken
peppers
and
onions
drenched
in
hot
sauce
and
it
stood
up
to
it
and
complimented
it
extremely
well
this
beer
would
be
great
alongside
any
big
flavor
foods
pours
a
beautiful
amber
copper
color
witha
nice
perfectly
formed
head
with
great
retention
and
then
to
top
it
off
great
lacing
the
smell
comes
in
big
with
malty
sweetness
and
a
big
citrusy
hops
aroma
the
taste
is
also
big
with
malty
sweetness
and
citrusy
hops
with
a
hint
of
rasins
from
the
special
b
malt
that
i
think
they
probably
use
the
mouthfeel
is
pure
bliss
for
big
beerbig
hops
lovers
i
could
drink
these
all
day
or
at
least
until
i
passed
out
did
i
mention
that
i
love
this
beer
i
highly
recommend
it
to
anyone
that
hasnt
tried
it
alcohol
is
well
hidden
until
you
finish
the
bottle
this
beer
pours
a
deep
mahogany
color
with
a
hearty
tancolored
head
the
head
tenaciously
clings
to
every
inch
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
reminiscent
of
warm
pumpernickel
bread
and
a
good
bit
of
honey
a
stout
flavor
with
strong
overtones
of
yeast
and
hops
just
the
right
amount
of
smooth
and
creamy
a
very
hearty
wellmade
ale
i
quite
enjoyed
it
highly
recommended
to
anyone
who
enjoys

i

to
be
hops
a
sweet
and
bitter
type
of
hops
though
taste
is
quite
unique
for
me
i
think
this
is
my
first
foray
into
the
strong
american
ale
type
and
consist
mostly
of
some
strong
bitter
hops
and
underline
by
some
very
subtle
sweetness
wow
this
is
like
being
hit
on
the
head
with
a
brick

plainly
lots
of
malt
and
hops
are
included
in
here
the
alcohol
is
a
subtle
but
complement
very
well
drinkability
im
not
sure
it
is
a
class
act
but
i
dont
think
i
could
put
down
too
many
of
these
but
just
to
sip
a
couple
is
an
experience
you
should
not
miss

it

then
the
rich
and
roasted
character
appears
again
with
a
nice
layering
of

flavor
and
finishes
with
a

this
beer
is
so
unique
the

profile
is

any

i

and
in
my
opinion
a
nice
session
beer
cause
frankly
you
cant
drink
much
else
after
the
havok
this
wreaks
on
your
pallate
dark
ruby
red
color
made
me
think
of
blood
for
some
reason
wonderfully
sweet
fruity
smell
sweet
beginning
rapidly
becomes
an
intense
but
not
too
intense
bitterness
nicely
balanced
this
place
had
a
great
selection
of
beer
on
tap
but
i
every
time
i
looked
the
beer
list
over
i
found
myself
ordering
another
bastard
goes
down
very
easily
maybe
due
to
the
slightly
lower
abv
for
a
iipa
hope
it
is
as
good
in
bottles
still
the
same
amber
darkness
with
a
tight
tannishcolored
head
aromas
are
complex
lots
of
hop
notes
with
a
firmly
established
malt
base
this
carries
into
the
flavor
at
first
the
hops
lie
dormant
lulling
you
into
a
false
sense
of
security
but
they
quickly
rise
up
and
pounce
upon
your
unsuspecting
palate
this
hop
bitterness
isnt
going
anywhere
and
it
stays
entrenched
on
your
palate
all
the
way
through
the
finish
delightful
excellent
mouthfeel
and
carbonation
a
fixture
for
me
from
now
on
whenever
i
visit
the
ale
houses
deep
dark
red
with
a
creamy
tan
head
and
a
mild
hoppy
smell
a
very
smooth
and
well
balanced
beer
though
somewhat
on
the
hoppy
side
tart
citrusy
taste
and
hops
you
can
really
notice
but
then
again
its
also
got
a
notcieable
sweet
and
malty
flavor
this
beer
goes
down
really
really
easy
with
a
clean
crisp
finish
i
would
probably
go
so
far
as
to
say
the
arrogant
bastard
is
the
great
wallenda
of
balanced
ales
well
before
his
tragic
end
anyway
super
refreshing
i
dont
think
its
as
strong
with
the
hops
as
some
people
maybe
it
was
the
tap
or
the
beers
i
had
beforehand
very
enjoyable
beer
overall
heavy
on
the
hops
with
just
enough
malt
to
balance
it
out
nirvana
pure
and
simple
this
wondrous
beer
pours
out
a
deep
cloudy
reddishbrown
with
a
decent
head
of
almond
color
the
bottle
alone
is
worth
commenting
on
etched
glass
instead
of
the
typical
stickon
label
this
is
a
collectors
item
bottle
the
smell
is
strong
with
tons
of
sweet
malt
and
maybe
some
honey
quite
nice
taste
is
a
complex
mixture
of
overwhelming
malty
sweetness
that
is
quickly
extinguished
by
a
huge
bitterness
the
finish
is
strongly
bitter
and
fairly
dry
the
bitterness
lasts
several
minutes
beyond
your
most
recent
swallow
if
you
can
wait
that
long
that
is
mouthfeel
is
exactly
what
i
like
it
is
something
akin
to
eating
a
sandwhich
carbonated
to
just
the
right
amount
not
even
close
to
flat
but
definitely
not
overly
carbonated
this
is
not
your
average
beer
by
a
far
stretch
i
actually
attempted
to
homebrew
a
batch
of
beer
that
tasted
fairly
similar
to
arrogant
bastard
the
difference
stone
brewery
got
it
right
and
i
really
screwed
it
up
this
is
one
for
the
books
drink
it
alone
with
friends
at
a
movie
in
the
park
you
cant
go
wrong
with
this
one
but
a
word
of
caution
this
isnt
for
everyone
just
like
the
bottle
says
you
really
have
to
like
high
abv
extremely
bitter
beers
to
venture
into
this
territory
this
brew
is
so
thick
and
rich
and
chewy
i
can
see
how
it
led
up
to
the
double
bastard
which
i
still
like
better
the
whisky
taste
is
appropriate
for
the
style
i
suppose
though
not
exactly
to
my
taste
i
had
the
oaked
bastard
at
the
real
ale
festival
and
didnt
like
it
and
perhaps
part
of
it
was
because
it
was
so
unexpected
overall
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
from
a
bottle
drinkability
i
dont
think
that
this
beer
was
designed
to
have
more
than
one
or
two
honestly
its
hard
for
me
to
compare
this
beer
to
anything
else
its
in
a
category
by
itself
highly
recommended
for
those
who
love
highly
hopped
beer
with
balls
this
is
a
big
bruiser
of
a
beer
everything
about
it
is
upfront
and
in
your
face
it
has
a
nice
threeway
balance
between
the
hops
malt
and
booze
which
to
me
are
all
at
their
maximum
for
a
drinkable
as
opposed
to
sippable
beer
a
little
more
of
any
one
and
id
have
to
slow
way
down
my
highly
subjective
impression
is
that
none
of
the
elements
hops
malt
booze
seem
integrated
into
the
other
elements
but
rather
are
simply
opposed
to
each
other
in
nearperfect
balance
or
as
if
all
three
were
trying
to
get
through
a
doorway
at
once
and
were
hindering
each
others
prgress
or
maybe
its
just
the
booze
talking
or
maybe
its
true
im
not
worthy
man
now
i
need
another
one
of
these
beer
is
good
happy
arrogant
beering
wyll
second
bottle
from
francisweizen
amazing
yet
again
the
smell
is
amazing
thick
sticky
hops
and
a
malty
alcohol
body
brilliant
i
thought
my
taste
buds
had
changed
enough
to
enjoy
this
but
i
was
wrong
pure
hoppy
bitterness
through
and
through
some
candied
fruitgrapefruit
emerge
34
of
the
way
through
but
its
too
little
too
late
i
was
just
going
to
give
this
a
4
0
for
looks
then
i
took
the
bottle
into
consideration
the
aroma
is
subtle
and
hard
to
pinpoint
but
is
very
pleasant
the
first
taste
full
of
creamy
foam
is
wonderful
the
abv
is
somewhat
apparent
throughout
with
a
strong
alcohol
flavor
but
definitely
not
overwhelming
the
mouthfeel
is
tingly
on
the
roof
of
the
mouth
with
ample
carbonation
and
hop
flavor
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
is
not
for
everyone
like
the
label
says
you
are
not
worthy
a
real
nice
beer
as
i
stated
earlier
im
really
starting
to
like
these
beers
after
having
an
old
woody
thnks
to
weefishheads
and
trying
a
batch
6000
a
few
weeks
ago
im
starting
to
favor
this
style
more
and
more
the
review
characteristics
have
been
adjusted
up
by
0
5
for
appearance
smell
and
drinkability
to
reflect
and
average
of
the
two
serving
types
basing
this
only
on
my
bottle
review
im
sure
there
would
have
been
a
5
or
two
in
there
this
is
my
first
sample
of
anything
from
stone
brewing
nothing
else
i
have
ever
had
tastes
quite
like
this
very
very
hoppy
and
being
that
i
am
not
a
hop
fan
i
did
not
care
for
that
taste
like
i
thought
that
i
would
poured
a
dark
garnet
copper
red
colour
with
a
dirty
sandlike
head
the
head
faded
away
to
a
thin
film
quickly
the
smell
is
a
little
sweet
a
bit
fruit
date
or
raisin
like
actually
and
definately
complex
the
texture
of
the
taste
is
very
smooth
and
almost
silky
this
stuff
was
way
too
grassy
for
me
with
a
tiny
bit
of
caramel
as
well
it
leaves
a
very
faint
chocolate
like
aftertaste
about
a
second
or
two
after
you
take
a
sip
i
wasnt
quite
as
impressed
as
i
thought
i
would
be
this
is
a
highly
recommended
beer
that
i
would
probably
buy
more
if
i
could
get
it
easier
picked
this
one
up
at
kclingers
in
hanover
and
it
is
not
sold
in
maryland
where
i
buy
nearly
all
of
my
beers
hopefuly
i
might
catch
this
one
on
hand
pump
at
kclingers
someday
i
think
it
would
be
terrific
served
that
way
mellowed
out
just
a
little
bit
had
this
on
tap
at
dr
dremos
i
will
mainly
just
comment
on
the
differences
in
experience
from
having
this
in
the
bottle
this
one
came
a
deep
crimson
red
with
a
medium
to
small
head
that
dissipates
fairly
quickly
aroma
of
hops
mainly
citrus
and
a
nice
malt
sweetness
to
round
it
out
more
so
than
i
remember
from
the
bottle
the
taste
seems
much
more
smooth
and
less
rough
the
hops
make
them
selves
known
but
are
not
as
sharp
as
the
bottle
the
malts
blend
well
and
made
for
an
overall
smoother
taste
full
bodied
and
more
drinkable
on
tap
great
all
around
beer
and
even
got
my
girlfriend
drinking
it
very
smooth
heavy
feel
in
the
mouth
served
in
a
22oz
bottle
i
asked
for
a
glass
but
it
never
arrived
nicely
rounded
hoppy
flavor
balanced
with
the
malts
and
fruity
undertones
the
carbonation
was
perfectaccentated
the
flavor
on
the
tongue
but
you
never
noticed
the
bubbling
best
served
relatively
cold
i
noticed
as
i
kept
drinking
and
the
beer
was
warming
some
of
the
taste
was
lost
a
very
fine
ale
this
pours
a
very
dark
amber
color
there
is
a
wonderful
brown
foamy
head
whic
lasts
the
tase
is
indeed
complex
but
pleasant
there
is
a
caramelcoffee
malty
sweetness
nice
balanced
with
a
hoppy
bitterness
thick
on
the
tongue
definitely
buy
a
bottle
and
check
it
out
you
wont
regret
the
adventure
the
drinkabilty
was
great
for
such
a
huge
uncompromising
beer
a
very
nicely
balanced
beer
for
sure
really
an
excellent
and
quaffable
ale
but
im
downgrading
it
to
selfconfident
tough
guy
with
a
soft
spot
for
kittens
dark
amber
colour
with
a
tan
head
which
takes
a
while
to
fade
smells
of
hops
with
a
slight
citrus
backing
hops
dominate
upon
the
first
sip
carmal
malt
flavors
keep
the
balance
all
kinds
of
stuff
going
on
in
my
mouth
right
now
hard
to
sort
it
all
out
even
thought
the
hops
are
dominate
i
have
to
say
that
its
the
malt
that
carries
this
brew
pretty
heavy
in
the
mouthfeel
department
two
bombers
are
more
than
enough
wow
i
think
its
actually
more
of
a
barleywine
than
an
ale
but
whatever
it
is
it
is
one
tasty
mofo
dont
know
whats
up
with
the
whole
iron
maiden
motif
but
its
a
great
beer
ill
be
back
overall
impression
extremely
enjoyable
i
may
have
to
learn
to
age
a
few
bottles
to
see
if
they
mellow
out
to
where
the
kegs
seem
to
be
where
the
bottles
seem
like
a
full
frontal
assault
on
every
sensory
organ
you
own
this
is
more
of
a
controlled
takeover
an
authoritative
methodical
full
swedish
massage
of
every
sensory
organ
you
own
if
you
know
the
bastard
and
you
see
him
on
tap
pay
a
visit
strongly
recommended
served
on
draught
i
was
presented
with
a
very
dark
red
mahogany
brew
with
a
thin
creamy
head
that
clings
to
the
glass
all
the
way
to
the
bottom
the
nose
did
not
impress
me
as
much
as
the
toasted
malty
flavor
the
balance
of
malts
to
hops
was
nicely
done
with
just
enough
bittering
bite
on
the
tongue
to
keep
it
interesting
the
alcohol
taste
didnt
hint
to
the
7
1
if
you
want
this
as
a
session
beer
it
will
be
a
short
night
if
beer
was
wine
id
classify
this
as
a
port
something
to
be
sipped
slowly
savored
after
a
gourmet
meal
but
this
is
not
a
thirstquencher
youd
slug
down
frat
boys
with
bongs
need
not
apply
certainly
a
beer
to
include
in
your
regular
rotation
ill
be
reviewing
it
again
in
the
future
the
beer
pours
a
dark
ruby
red
color
with
a
thick
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
the
aroma
is
great
it
has
a
rich
malt
scent
which
is
enhanced
with
the
presence
of
beautiful
citrous
hops
the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
complex
malt
core
which
gives
it
a
dark
yet
very
bitter
flavor
along
with
some
intense
flavoring
hops
this
brew
is
truely
fantastic
it
goes
down
easy
and
has
a
lingering
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
great
sessions
brew
it
has
great
flavor
a
good
drinker
awesome
brew
im
sure
theres
things
im
missing
but
this
is
really
top
notch
presented
in
a
22oz
bottle
with
quite
a
humorous
description
on
the
backside
and
a
cool
pic
on
the
front
all
painted
label
poured
a
deep
dark
ruby
brown
color
with
two
finger
off
white
head
pretty
good
retention
on
the
head
and
leaving
sticky
lace
aroma
is
spicy
citrusy
hops
sweet
fruit
with
a
background
of
chocolate
maltiness
really
a
pleasant
unique
aroma
taste
starts
as
a
malty
cocoa
toasted
grain
flavor
and
finishes
with
a
really
spicy
kick
from
the
hops
and
a
bitter
warming
alcohol
effect
at
the
very
end
excellent
beer
and
still
very
drinkable
despite
the
aggresiveness
that
the
back
label
describes
while
it
is
aggressive
if
you
like
a
hopped
up
strong
ale
this
cant
be
beat
very
balanced
and
unique
my
first
and
currently
only
arogant
bastard
ale
pours
a
dark
cloudy
mahogany
with
small
head
and
medium
lacing
the
smell
is
overpowering
hops
piney
citrus
malts
sweet
smokey
dark
ripe
fruits
etc
man
a
little
bit
or
a
big
bit
of
everything
in
this
here
beer
the
taste
knocked
me
on
my
ass
i
really
mean
that
at
7
2
this
is
a
serious
brew
but
man
the
deep
chestnuts
smokiness
ripe
fruit
pine
citrus
very
serious
brew
the
initial
taste
reminded
me
of
another
brew
black
douglas
which
is
actually
a
scotch
brew
where
the
alcohol
was
very
prevalent
but
the
malty
sweetness
really
balanced
it
out
the
big
difference
with
this
brew
was
the
intense
hop
bitterness
that
just
kept
on
coming
but
never
overpowered
the
other
flavors
this
is
no
hype
no
lie
on
my
top
5
of
best
all
around
brews
i
think
a
case
of
bombers
is
warranted
and
just
think
ive
still
got
double
bastard
hanging
out
in
the
cellar
sweet
one
last
thing
for
all
this
beer
is
offering
its
still
drinkable
no
poundable
but
definitely
more
than
one
if
youre
lucky
enough
to
find
singles
wow
what
a
beauty
of
a
beer
right
out
of
the
gate
pretty
mahogany
with
bright
orange
and
ruby
hues
the
head
lays
thick
and
creamy
unflinching
begging
to
be
tasted
the
stick
is
solid
all
the
way
a
complex
aromatic
brew
featuring
sweet
grainy
breadlike
aromas
followed
by
inticing
hop
bitter
in
the
mouth
this
baby
is
thick
and
rich
bordering
syrupy
a
taste
delight
once
past
the
lips
the
beer
drips
with
flavortoasty
malt
a
wonderfull
fruitiness
midpalate
adds
a
kiss
of
sweetness
a
well
balanced
while
never
delicate
brew
a
twangy
peppery
highly
assertive
hop
bitter
prevails
on
the
mile
long
finish
a
mouthfull
of
unapologetic
goodness
and
a
great
way
to
cap
off
a
fine
day
off
here
in
chicago
courtesy
of
the
downright
upright
jackndan
thanks
for
the
treat
my
friend
love
the
youre
not
worthy
story
on
the
bottle
pours
a
nice
copper
color
with
beautiful
lacing
of
the
head
the
smell
of
hops
is
overwhelming
but
not
in
a
bad
way
very
balanced
and
enticing
on
first
taste
the
hops
assault
your
tongue
awakening
your
taste
buds
for
the
rest
of
the
glass
finishes
with
hops
lingering
in
your
mouth
the
beer
has
lived
up
to
hype
and
is
worth
seeking
out
if
you
cant
get
it
locally
the
intersting
thing
is
the
beer
seems
to
change
as
it
gets
warmer
the
hops
almost
seperate
themselves
into
different
flavor
categories
as
the
temperature
increases
it
would
be
an
interesting
test
to
blind
taste
the
beer
at
40
degrees
and
at
50
degrees
to
see
if
anyone
could
tell
if
it
was
the
same
beer
comments
a
wonderful
elixer
deserving
of
its
hype
and
perfectly
drinkable
i
was
surprised
by
the
aggressive
hop
character
and
expected
a
more
assertive
malt
presence
for
what
is
classified
as
a
strong
old
ale
but
certainly
not
disappointed
in
this
modern
american
classic
wish
i
had
a
few
cases
of
this
in
the
cellar
it
is
fruity
and
smooth
in
the
mouth
but
that
bitterness
lingers
it
is
fullbodied
and
good
from
first
sip
to
last
drop
and
stone
was
right
i
am
not
worthy
i
feel
like
a
crack
addict
i
know
that
arrogant
is
on
tap
not
even
2
miles
from
my
house
arrogant
is
so
good
that
i
had
to
hide
my
wallet
and
car
keys
in
order
to
avoid
a
bender
i
have
thought
about
walking
and
would
have
been
down
at
the
bar
drinking
instead
of
writing
a
review
except
for
the
alligator
filled
moat
that
i
built
to
keep
my
butt
at
my
house
and
not
down
at
the
bar
im
not
sure
my
palate
is
advanced
enough
to
decipher
all
the
flavors
that
were
blasting
my
tongue
when
i
tasted
this
beer
there
was
sweetness
hoppiness
and
a
wonderful
mix
of
flavor
its
definitely
worth
drinking
once
but
i
dont
know
if
id
make
a
night
of
it
great
beer
overall
pours
a
reddish
brown
with
a
billous
head
that
never
went
away
beautiful
lacing
to
the
finish
aroma
of
hops
and
a
roated
malt
that
is
oh
so
inviting
although
it
has
a
high
abv
content
i
never
felt
this
got
in
the
way
of
the
superb
rich
malt
that
receed
for
a
while
to
be
replace
by
the
hop
flavoring
only
to
give
way
again
for
more
rich
malt
defintely
one
of
the
best
of
its
style
as
this
will
now
be
distributed
locally
i
am
looking
forward
to
enjoying
it
when
the
mood
strikes
me
to
just
relax
and
take
some
time
to
enjoy
a
really
great
brew
love
stone
the
label
is
just
so
much
fun
on
this
bottle
i
mean
how
can
you
not
love
a
good
beer
that
insults
ya
pours
a
nice
reddish
brown
with
a
thin
caramel
colored
head
that
is
very
light
in
froth
and
not
too
much
retention
lightly
hop
scented
and
light
carbination
very
hoppy
beer
with
good
bitterness
tastes
of
toffee
and
caramel
burnt
toast
little
bit
of
licorish
very
hoppy
and
great
tasting
beer
good
and
strong
and
full
of
flavor
like
i
like
em
may
not
be
a
good
session
beer
due
to
the
7
2
but
wonderful
and
a
good
staple
in
my
home
poured
into
a
tumbler
from
a
22oz
bottle
the
beer
developed
a
fair
and
retentive
head
the
deep
reddish
brown
liquid
is
quite
enticing
the
aroma
is
dominated
by
the
intense
hops
with
strong
citrus
notes
grapefruit
and
hints
of
pine
the
taste
is
surprisingly
well
balanced
there
is
a
big
malt
presence
which
is
almost
bigger
than
the
unquestionably
intense
hops
the
flavors
roll
between
caramel
and
grapefruit
the
beer
was
well
bodied
and
quite
drinkable
but
not
exactly
a
session
brew
i
can
drink
this
maybe
i
just
grew
to
like
hop
monsters
who
knows
overall
a
great
beer
and
i
was
not
disappointed
by
the
hype
it
doesnt
make
the
top
of
my
list
but
i
would
definitely
drink
it
again
whether
on
tap
or
not
its
not
distributed
in
md
so
its
hard
for
me
to
get
my
hands
on
some
this
beer
lives
up
to
the
hype
100
in
my
eyes
and
i
proudly
proclaim
i
am
worthy
overall
this
beer
is
definitely
one
of
my
favorites
i
will
be
drinking
this
one
fairly
regularly
more
than
a
hint
of
carbonation
drinkability
good
i
could
have
another
this
really
is
an
intense
beer
though
so
i
doubt
i
could
toss
them
back
in
succession
nice
to
have
had
it
though
im
going
back
for
a
growler
the
taste
is
the
best
part
of
this
beer
im
still
working
on
how
to
describe
beers
but
all
i
can
say
is
that
this
beer
is
pretty
intense
lots
of
flavor
i
couldnt
drink
em
all
night
but
i
could
drink
em
every
night
ps
i
notice
that
my
reviews
are
longer
when
the
beers
are
interesting
and
complicated
it
seems
that
my
ratings
are
proportionate
to
the
length
of
the
review
pours
ruby
to
mahogany
in
color
serve
from
a
bomber
at
cellar
temperature
dense
foamy
head
develops
about
three
fingers
head
head
retention
is
good
with
a
head
remaining
for
a
long
time
smells
hoppy
first
taste
reveals
a
strong
bitter
hoppy
presence
tastes
like
an
ipa
very
in
your
face
hop
presence
aftertaste
remains
for
a
long
time
im
searching
for
anything
other
than
the
strong
bitter
hops
taste
i
thought
i
got
a
little
citrus
undertones
on
the
first
sip
but
that
doesnt
seem
present
in
the
second
im
probably
drinking
a
little
warmer
than
ideal
serving
temperature
i
prefer
something
a
little
better
balanced
a
decent
selection
but
not
one
i
would
travel
miles
for
while
a
bit
less
beefy
than
some
of
its
brethren
its
arguably
more
artfully
balanced
its
also
simpler
than
some
stone
offerings
but
that
is
in
no
way
a
down
note
its
malt
its
hops
and
it
delivers
both
in
a
smooth
blend
and
there
is
just
no
way
that
one
is
enough
no
matter
the
sign
on
the
bottle
its
likely
that
arrogance
never
tasted
so
good
i
love
hoppy
beers
and
this
is
my
number
one
favorite
no
one
even
comes
close
i
find
it
hard
to
believe
stone
ruination
and
stone
ipa
beat
this
out
on
ba
review
rankings
because
to
me
they
taste
a
tad
watery
in
comparison
dont
get
me
wrong
i
like
those
beers
but
no
where
near
as
well
as
aba
i
think
the
writing
on
the
bottle
says
it
all
so
i
finally
had
the
pleasure
of
drinking
a
stone
beer
pours
a
very
dark
amber
with
a
tan
head
suprisingly
the
head
didnt
last
longer
lacing
with
slither
down
your
glass
with
each
sip
though
smell
is
fruity
with
caramel
hops
taste
is
very
strong
but
with
great
roasted
and
fruit
tones
this
beer
explodes
in
the
mouth
very
full
and
lively
a
very
drinkable
beer
if
you
want
to
impress
someone
with
a
great
beer
this
is
the
one
to
get
an
excellent
strong
ale
first
off
one
of
the
best
aspects
of
this
beer
is
its
appearance
great
long
lasting
head
of
a
murky
yellow
white
color
the
beer
is
ruby
in
color
very
cool
to
look
at
smell
is
very
respectable
and
bold
malty
and
yeasty
with
a
hint
of
sweetness
taste
is
very
complex
lightly
carbonated
this
beer
is
semisweet
with
a
subtle
bitter
aftertaste
i
discovered
flavors
such
as
the
bitter
of
grapefruit
which
i
didnt
really
like
since
i
dont
like
grapefruit
and
the
bite
of
baking
chocolate
thumbs
up
to
this
brew
sadly
though
i
wont
be
drinking
much
of
this
since
it
is
wildly
overpriced
at
the
only
local
store
that
sells
it
5
for
a
bomber
way
to
go
stone
char
overall
a
very
smooth
drinking
beer
i
could
easily
see
this
as
a
session
beer
if
not
for
the
wallop
of
the
7
2
alcohol
which
is
not
noticeable
as
you
drink
it
reddish
brown
body
with
very
low
carbonation
and
a
thin
head
that
is
gone
is
a
matter
of
seconds
lace
is
also
quite
minimal
and
the
beer
has
very
still
appearance
in
general
aroma
is
on
the
sweetish
side
with
flowery
hops
and
malts
that
smell
like
honey
i
can
also
detect
a
fair
bit
of
grain
on
the
nose
with
hints
on
vanilla
and
oak
malt
profile
is
very
scottish
with
sweet
caramel
plum
cherry
vanilla
and
a
bit
of
smoked
grain
hops
are
quite
detectable
and
become
more
pronounced
as
the
beer
warms
some
the
hops
add
some
dryness
to
the
aftertaste
due
to
their
spicy
woody
character
but
they
are
not
really
bitter
as
the
beer
gets
warmer
still
the
malts
that
had
been
subdued
by
the
hops
make
a
big
comeback
with
very
fruity
esters
silky
smooth
mouthfeel
with
a
nicely
warming
alcohol
content
a
sipping
beer
to
wind
down
a
stressful
day
at
work
as
the
experience
is
totally
relaxing
and
mellow
i
finally
got
one
the
pour
was
incredible
dark
copperred
with
a
beautiful
foamy
head
an
inch
thick
that
fell
to
a
creamy
thin
line
that
stuck
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
throughout
the
drink
the
smell
was
full
of
strong
hop
spice
with
a
hint
of
malt
and
a
slight
floral
overtone
the
taste
started
with
a
great
hop
kick
that
lasted
from
start
to
finish
somewhere
in
the
middle
i
gained
a
kick
of
malt
the
finish
bordered
on
oily
with
lingering
hop
overtones
all
and
all
this
was
a
great
brew
ng
this
is
a
symbol
for
what
is
so
good
in
brewing
today
it
is
large
and
in
your
face
and
does
not
care
which
companies
pay
lots
of
money
to
promote
their
product
it
is
brown
in
color
with
ruby
highlights
the
aroma
is
full
of
hops
and
some
malt
the
bitterness
is
up
front
and
the
body
is
a
sweet
and
smooth
maltiness
it
has
a
big
hop
finish
that
is
herbal
and
minty
this
beer
is
extreme
and
just
wonderful
had
on
tap
at
chumleys
in
lafayette
this
should
be
what
all
other
craft
brews
are
measured
against
appearance
is
a
nice
ruby
brown
with
a
quickly
disapating
tan
head
there
is
a
strong
raisin
taste
in
this
beer
which
yields
to
a
strong
hop
profile
the
smell
hints
at
more
malt
than
the
taste
would
have
you
believe
this
beer
is
balanced
very
well
and
the
alcohol
is
completely
hidden
this
beer
would
never
be
a
bad
choice
and
will
continue
to
be
an
excellent
standby
for
me
definitely
one
for
the
hopheads
tall
head
malty
aroma
clear
ruby
brown
color
all
praise
attributed
to
this
popular
california
ale
is
well
deserved
it
is
creamy
smooth
delicious
has
a
biting
bitter
edge
and
clean
finish
a
hearty
ale
with
robust
properties
all
around
the
body
teams
with
malt
while
the
bitterness
is
pronounced
yet
not
overdone
all
is
well
proportioned
and
balanced
and
the
mouthfeel
is
sublime
this
is
a
champion
among
beers
and
i
love
all
that
youre
not
worthy
stuff
more
power
to
em
it
reminds
me
of
old
peculiar
only
more
drinkable
the
taste
is
quite
complex
even
though
it
seems
to
be
quite
smooth
can
sense
some
caramel
and
roasted
flavor
up
front
that
go
nice
with
the
brew
has
a
bit
of
an
alcohol
taste
to
it
but
not
overly
strong
the
brew
finishes
with
a
very
noticeable
hop
punch
that
smooth
out
to
a
somewhat
sweet
taste
over
all
a
nice
brew
not
one
of
my
favorite
styles
but
i
can
see
why
it
has
the
much
deserved
hype
notes
still
not
sure
if
im
worthy
but
at
least
bottles
cant
be
the
judge
on
tap
fresh
and
tasty
pours
a
regal
dark
auburn
tiny
bubbles
lifting
a
moderate
head
and
leaving
some
killer
lace
this
brew
oozes
hops
citrus
grapefruit
resins
oatybready
malt
balance
this
is
a
tasty
strong
brew
to
be
cherished
and
sought
out
again
and
again
enjoy
the
arrogance
this
is
an
outstanding
old
ale
balanced
full
of
flavor
looks
the
part
too
and
just
think
ive
got
the
double
bastard
still
to
try
um
wow
my
beermate
and
i
raved
about
this
one
from
start
to
finish
some
beers
are
interesting
in
a
novel
way
others
are
simply
good
and
balanced
this
one
is
both
and
then
some
pours
a
unique
rubybrown
color
with
a
respectable
amount
of
head
and
some
active
carbonation
from
the
moment
the
beer
hits
the
glass
the
smell
bloodies
your
nose
with
a
barrage
of
grapefruit
as
the
beer
warms
and
the
citrus
hops
scatter
a
bit
some
pleasant
malts
are
detectable
as
well
the
grapefruit
notes
carry
over
to
the
taste
but
the
flavors
evolve
nicely
over
time
by
the
time
i
was
done
the
hops
were
fading
to
a
dry
scotchlike
malty
flavor
in
between
is
something
of
a
caramely
balance
of
flavors
resins
cling
a
lot
at
first
though
not
unpleasantly
as
the
taste
gives
way
to
malts
the
mouthfeel
likewise
gives
way
to
a
richer
softer
texture
despite
its
intensity
this
one
is
very
drinkable
this
will
be
one
to
savor
in
the
future
as
well
as
to
expose
my
yellow
beerdrinking
friends
to
what
an
assertive
creative
brewer
can
do
do
i
think
stone
products
are
overhyped
yes
a
bit
will
i
have
another
arrogant
bastard
certainly
i
love
the
stuff
i
try
not
to
make
a
night
of
it
though
all
in
all
this
is
a
great
beer
very
complex
i
love
the
heavy
hops
and
eventhough
i
have
trouble
recognizing
the
other
flavors
i
do
enjoy
them
graceful
amber
pour
with
excellent
lacing
that
lasted
throughout
the
drink
step
lightly
ye
filthy
bilge
rats
tis
nay
a
beer
to
be
scoffing
thick
nose
with
a
bit
of
alcohol
aroma
but
not
enough
to
turn
one
away
sticky
maltiness
with
great
hops
that
should
set
ones
tongue
afire
with
a
taste
like
none
other
the
bottles
right
im
not
worthy
shall
i
compare
this
beer
to
a
summers
day
i
usually
dont
like
people
who
are
bastards
or
arrogant
but
this
one
has
deserves
the
moniker
beautiful
red
pour
with
a
thick
enticing
creamy
head
that
retains
very
well
lacing
is
amazing
beautiful
smell
is
of
slight
alcohol
with
a
wafting
of
hops
to
warn
you
that
this
beer
is
not
to
be
messed
with
my
nonick
pint
is
still
trembling
from
the
pour
taste
taste
is
thick
not
quite
chewy
malt
goodness
overtaken
by
serious
hoppyness
with
alcohol
mixing
in
with
the
hops
before
giving
way
to
a
pleasantly
bitter
aftertaste
this
begs
to
be
sipped
again
not
too
quickly
though
as
seven
percent
is
more
than
most
mere
mortals
can
manage
slight
carbonation
not
overpowering
at
all
heck
its
there
but
with
beer
this
good
youre
going
to
be
concerned
with
other
hoppening
matters
a
good
introduction
to
the
hoppy
and
malty
potential
of
beer
let
the
masses
drink
their
tasteless
macro
yellow
junk
theyre
not
worthy
i
raise
my
pint
of
the
bastard
to
them
bwahaha
cant
believe
this
was
on
cask
the
bottle
warned
me
that
i
would
not
like
this
ale
lies
it
poured
a
beautiful
dark
amber
with
a
substantial
lasting
foamy
brown
head
big
hop
aroma
with
malt
undertones
and
hints
of
freshly
cut
grass
the
mouthfeel
was
full
and
creamy
with
a
light
carbonation
sweet
malt
up
front
hoppy
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
this
is
an
ale
that
says
youre
drinking
me
and
youre
liking
me
or
to
hell
with
ya
not
being
one
who
wishes
for
hell
i
choose
to
enjoy
this
brew
wow
big
malt
but
a
very
very
hoppy
taste
comes
right
after
wouldnt
have
expected
it
to
be
this
big
from
the
aroma
very
full
bodied
malt
with
an
extremely
assertive
hops
profile
it
would
sound
like
this
beer
is
just
a
onedimensional
big
beer
but
its
actually
very
well
balanced
and
complex
there
are
alot
of
strong
flaovors
in
here
sweet
malt
caramel
hops
and
spice
and
they
all
complement
each
other
wonderfully
on
top
of
all
that
its
just
one
asskicker
of
a
beer
in
abv
and
big
taste
i
am
always
suspicious
of
gimmicky
ad
campaigns
but
arrogant
bastard
is
a
perfect
name
for
this
brew
lives
up
to
the
hype
i
finally
got
a
gallon
of
this
brew
this
week
a
local
pizza
parlor
had
my
favorite
beer
on
tap
and
oh
my
lord
this
is
so
awesome
the
color
is
a
deep
brown
thick
creamy
head
that
lasts
the
aroma
of
pungent
grapefruit
rind
comes
just
short
of
overwhelming
the
senses
you
want
hops
hops
in
three
foot
high
letters
alcohol
fumes
drift
up
and
are
overcome
by
the
sweet
malt
which
is
in
turn
over
come
by
a
killer
dry
bitter
aftertaste
redolent
of
black
coffee
this
beer
has
become
a
local
favorite
you
gotta
try
this
deep
copper
body
with
a
thin
light
brown
head
dark
and
taunting
aroma
contains
a
truckload
of
bold
hops
one
of
those
beers
that
smell
thick
probably
due
to
abundant
crystal
malt
light
citrus
character
and
a
suggestion
at
leather
taste
is
very
crystal
malty
with
a
weird
hop
profile
leading
to
a
untypical
dry
finish
chalky
dusty
ashes
and
slightly
smokey
very
bitter
aftertaste
body
is
typical
stone
very
full
thick
almost
syrupy
not
my
favorite
stone
but
i
gotta
recognize
the
attitude
dark
dirty
amber
color
with
light
tan
head
that
clings
to
the
glass
all
the
way
down
nice
lacing
smells
of
malt
and
hops
citrus
and
pine
tastes
of
carmel
roasted
malt
with
citrus
bite
of
hops
finishing
off
the
brew
it
is
a
strong
wonderful
tasting
beer
with
a
great
hop
bite
wonderful
brew
always
have
some
on
hand
very
enjoyable
i
found
traits
of
many
styles
in
this
brew
while
lookingsmellingdrinking
this
i
thought
this
is
an
amber
ale
no
this
is
an
ipa
no
this
tastes
a
bit
like
a
porter
but
a
bit
like
a
stout
this
is
great
stone
has
impressed
the
hell
out
of
me
again
while
i
dont
believe
that
it
rises
to
the
heights
of
their
beloved
in
my
case
ipa
i
can
recognize
arrogant
bastard
ale
as
yet
another
superb
example
of
this
brewerys
brilliance
am
i
worthy
barely
just
barely
despite
being
apparently
different
styles
the
entire
time
i
drank
this
i
was
comparing
it
to
alpha
king
three
floyds
and
stone
i
see
as
two
premiere
microbreweries
in
high
demand
ab
and
ak
are
the
two
flagship
brews
so
i
subconciously
was
measuring
the
two
against
each
other
while
i
really
enjoyed
this
and
would
definitely
buy
it
again
ak
is
better
imo
a
very
dark
copper
color
with
a
rusty
head
that
is
frothy
to
the
extreme
the
lacing
is
also
very
thick
and
entrancing
its
a
very
nice
looking
beer
the
smell
is
almost
more
than
one
can
handle
with
an
aroma
that
smells
of
fruity
hops
and
a
malty
alcohol
scent
the
taste
is
like
nothing
else
with
a
huge
hit
of
hops
and
malty
character
that
blows
your
mind
this
beer
only
gets
better
as
it
warms
something
that
every
beer
lover
must
try
not
for
the
faint
at
heart
sampled

no
wonder
this
is
a
top
50
brew
poured
amber
with
a
creamy
head
that
lasted
beautiful
smell
or
should
i
say
smells
invited
you
to
drink
i
detected
sweet
malt
tangy
hops
fruitiness
and
alcohol
what
a
great
blend
taste
was
equally
complex
a
surrge
of
mouth
sweetness
that
changed
to
citrusy
and
hoppy
on
the
finisha
tangy
bitterness
remained
mmm
surprisingly
smooth
in
mouthfeel
for
such
a
high
abv
a
definite
sipper
that
was
very
drinkable
a
definite
recommendation
what
a
great
beer
i
liked
this
beer
but
not
as
much
as
the
boasting
on
the
bottle
i
would
definitely
try
this
one
again
big
bad
bold
and
brilliant
im
hooked
all
around
an
exceptional
beer
drinkability
this
brew
lives
up
to
the
hype
thank
the
maker
ha
ha
that
this
is
now
available
in
my
area
reminds
me
of
wailing
wench
but
less
rough
around
the
edges
which
is
nice
sometimes
i
have
to
say
i
prefer
stones
hoppier
offerings
head
is
interesting
need
to
swish
in
a
big
beer
glass
works
well
on
tap
too
had
at
blue
tusk
in
syracuse
in
late
2004
and
had
stouty
roast
in
it
and
bitterness
arrogant
and
amazing
id
search
this
one
out
anywhere
i
can
find
it
i
can
not
quite
place
the
malt
flavour
and
i
am
not
sure
of
the
hopping
i
could
not
tell
if
it
wanted
to
be
a
stong
ale
or
an
ipa
or
a
belgium
very
good
slightly
creamy
soft
carbonation
helps
keep
the
hops
in
check
surprisingly
drinkable
for
style
whats
truly
astounding
here
is
that
i
like
this
beer
despite
my
unending
loathing
for
grapefruit
i
like
this
ive
enjoyed
drinking
a
few
22ounce
bottles
of
this
and
i
know
ill
do
so
again
but
its
too
strong
for
me
to
want
to
drink
more
than
that
at
one
sitting
overall
its
an
enjoyable
novelty
but
in
my
opinion
its
a
bit
more
gimmicky
than
the
bottle
with
all
its
bragging
would
like
to
admit
john
this
is
one
of
the
best
hoppy
beers
on
the
market
having
moved
from
colorado
to
california
i
was
in
search
of
a
brewery
that
offered
great
tasting
hoppy
beers
stone
brewing
in
san
diego
offers
some
excellent
beer
including
arrogant
bastard
as
a
former
english
teacher
i
appreciate
the
creative
writing
on
the
back
of
the
bottle
this
beer
is
hoppy
yet
has
a
slightly
sweet
aftertaste
it
definitely
packs
a
punch
not
for
the
fainthearted
for
sure
i
enjoy
the
taste
so
much
i
could
drink
this
beer
every
day
i
have
also
had
it
on
tap
at
the
yardhouse
and
it
is
even
smoother
and
crisper
than
it
is
from
the
bottle
this
is
an
excellent
beer
and
one
of
my
favorites
well
the
waiting
for
me
is
overpours
a
gorgeous
amber
red
color
with
a
slight
head
wonderful
hop
aromacitrusvanillasome
spiciness
to
it
great
flavor
the
hops
are
definately
there
nice
earthy
aftertaste
the
hops
sure
do
leave
a
lingering
pucker
on
the
back
of
your
tongue
this
sucker
is
very
smooth
for
the
amount
of
hops
in
it
a
great
beer
all
aroundi
could
see
some
people
not
liking
itits
a
bit
more
imperial
then
your
average
imperial
ipabut
i
find
it
quite
yummy
arrogant
bastard
pours
a
deep
red
pint
with
medium
sized
tan
head
and
great
retention
and
lacing
it
smells
extremely
hoppy
but
infinitely
more
complex
with
citrus
overtones
the
taste
talk
about
arrogance
this
brew
is
so
complex
i
almost
dont
have
the
vocabulary
to
describe
what
im
tasting
it
has
a
big
malty
sweetness
which
masks
the
alcohol
content
really
well
smooth
warming
and
complex
arrogant
bastard
lives
up
to
its
name
and
is
utterly
amazing
very
drinkable
but
watch
it
due
to
the
alcohol
and
normal
serving
size
22
ounces
drinkability
one
of
the
reasons
to
stop
by
dr
dremos
if
you
ask
me
i
had
to
remove
their
strong
ale
from
my
palate
and
this
did
the
trick
ill
definitely
have
this
again
and
again
better
than
cats
its
beers
like
this
that
is
so
frustrating
about
web
sites
like
this
you
read
so
many
good
reviews
about
a
beerand
then
you
search
the
web
sites
and
you
pay
the
ridiculous
amount
of
shipping
to
sample
the
stuff
and
then
you
find
out
it
s
one
of
the
best
beers
you
ve
ever
tasted
and
now
your
only
option
is
to
pay
about
10
dollars
for
a
22
er
wonderful
wonderful
stuff
now
how
does
the
working
man
get
this
to
wisconsin
my
first
sampling
of
a
stone
brew
was
a
decidedly
good
one
the
arrogant
bastard
ale
was
most
definitely
a
big
beer
but
not
as
big
as
the
bottle
or
other
reviews
had
lead
me
to
believe
mind
you
this
brew
is
not
necessarily
for
the
faint
of
heart
but
it
wont
knock
you
on
your
ass
with
no
hope
for
recovery
either
it
pours
a
dark
dark
reddish
brown
colour
with
a
nice
tan
head
that
lasts
and
lasts
and
lasts
there
is
a
dominant
spicy
smell
here
along
with
toasted
hops
and
a
sweetness
which
is
not
as
apparent
in
the
taste
where
the
toasted
flavours
dominate
a
complex
flavour
scheme
that
does
have
that
sweet
but
slightly
bitter
finish
to
it
this
one
most
definitely
gets
better
as
it
warms
so
let
it
sit
out
for
a
while
if
its
wicked
cold
from
being
in
your
fridge
a
most
enjoyable
brew
overall
i
have
wanted
to
try
this
for
a
long
time
the
bottle
tried
to
hurt
my
feelings
but
it
failed
for
it
was
wrong
i
do
like
this
beer
a
lot
a
copper
colored
beer
with
a
sweet
yet
bitter
taste
very
hoppy
and
nicley
malted
at
the
same
time
for
a
near
perfectly
balanced
brew
the
alcohol
was
just
the
right
level
the
warm
feeling
it
left
made
me
decide
to
drink
a
lot
of
this
this
winter
pale
amber
look
with
a
nice
white
head
with
good
retention
carmel
malt
sweetness
on
the
tongue
initially
this
malt
taste
is
then
cut
with
a
slightly
astringent
citrus
hop
wave
quite
smooth
and
drinkable
it
went
well
with
the
mussles
and
friets
at
eulogy
dark
copperbrown
in
color
with
a
very
nice
frothy
34in
head
that
has
nice
retention
the
head
is
quite
sticky
and
holds
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
slight
haze
is
noticeable
but
its
tough
to
tell
through
the
fairly
dark
color
lots
of
malty
caramel
notes
are
noticeable
during
the
pour
once
in
the
glass
the
aroma
of
malts
is
still
apparent
but
hops
stand
out
more
citrusy
grapefuity
hop
aromas
that
are
quite
clean
and
somewhat
sweet
nice
smooth
caramel
maltiness
up
front
then
a
bit
of
citric
hops
picks
up
with
roasted
notes
being
more
noticeable
towards
the
end
roasted
notes
linger
in
the
back
of
the
mouth
after
the
finish
some
sweet
hop
notes
are
also
noticeable
towards
the
end
the
body
is
medium
to
full
with
not
much
carbonation
but
the
hop
bite
seems
to
make
up
for
that
a
slight
hint
of
alcohol
is
noticeable
but
doesnt
hinder
the
flavor
any
nice
brew
well
balanced
and
quite
drinkable
definitely
lives
up
to
its
reputation
my
conversion
came
after
attending
the
stone
7th
anniversary
party
this
summer
after
a
few
of
these
in
the
hot
sun
i
was
converted
to
aba
enjoy
appearence
reddish
amber
color
very
clear
big
foaming
head
when
poured
which
took
quite
some
time
to
fade
leaving
lace
behind
smell
massively
heavy
hops
some
caramalt
malt
aroma
is
in
the
background
if
you
look
for
it
taste
a
malty
sweetness
battles
with
a
heavy
resinous
hop
soup
and
eventually
loses
out
mouthfeel
is
tingly
with
hop
bitterness
finishing
out
drinkability
an
aggressive
memorable
beer
im
not
really
a
big
hophead
but
this
is
very
wellmade
and
succeeds
at
what
it
aims
for
jeez
louise
is
this
beer
bangin
it
begins
with
a
big
upfront
hoppiness
with
a
wonderful
simultaneious
underlying
chocolateliness
then
it
is
all
big
ibus
from
there
this
is
an
amazingly
constructed
beer
this
is
much
more
than
just
a
big
hop
beer
it
has
a
lot
going
on
underneath
reviewing
it
at
a
4
i
still
urge
you
not
to
be
fooled
by
my
numbers
i
review
harshly
while
back
in
the
day
i
loved
stone
ipa
but
saw
arrogant
bastard
a
bit
over
the
top
and
not
quite
as
balanced
after
picking
it
back
up
i
must
say
i
was
wrong
if
your
pallette
has
been
broken
in
to
good
ipas
you
will
find
the
bitterness
of
this
beer
very
refreshing
and
not
overbearing
for
you
people
who
are
thrown
off
by
the
bitterness
i
asure
you
there
are
other
flavors
here
a
dash
of
caramel
a
bit
of
fruitiness
near
the
end
and
the
hint
of
spice
interlaced
with
the
hops
that
you
come
to
expect
from
a
good
stone
brew
cheers
the
ale
arrived
sporting
a
lovely
dark
amber
color
with
a
perfect
offwhite
head
the
aroma
was
good
with
some
hoppiness
being
the
strong
effect
on
the
nose
this
has
a
fantastic
malt
and
hop
balance
that
has
your
tastebuds
wanting
more
the
sweetness
and
bitterness
lasted
together
on
the
tongue
well
after
the
swallow
a
nice
lace
formed
on
the
glass
as
the
ale
was
being
emptied
from
the
glass
very
drinkable
and
overall
a
great
product
drinkability
overall
one
of
my
new
favorite
beers
not
sure
of
my
worthiness
but
this
is
a
beer
that
makes
the
trip
to
my
house
whenever
it
can
stone
good
beer
everything
the
bottle
is
but
a
little
less
intense
still
has
the
sweet
malt
paired
against
the
harsh
hop
character
it
just
seems
a
tad
more
tame
that
may
be
good
or
bad
depends
on
the
dirnker
but
since
this
is
arrogant
bastard
it
takes
it
down
a
notch
notes
i
first
tried
this
about
three
years
ago
and
i
definitely
was
not
worthy
after
trying
it
again
im
already
aching
to
prove
my
worth
with
another
bomber
this
brewery
has
a
unique
marketing
approach
definitely
read
the
bottle
as
you
drink
this
one
this
beer
for
all
of
the
hype
is
quite
balanced
between
the
hops
and
the
malt
definitely
hop
flavor
aroma
and
bitterness
crawling
all
over
the
place
in
this
one
but
a
nice
strong
maltiness
sweetness
that
carries
the
hop
brigade
quite
well
this
is
a
great
beer
that
is
a
nice
amber
color
my
very
first
arrogan
bastard
ale
i
was
a
little
intimidated
going
into
this
beer
knowing
how
robust
it
is
i
found
it
to
be
great
it
looked
awesome
smelled
awesome
and
tasted
awesome
there
is
nothing
more
that
i
can
say
about
the
aba
that
anyone
else
has
said
so
drink
up
and
save
a
bomber
for
me
it
is
attractive
i
bought
it
again
because
it
continued
to
remind
me
of
how
complex
a
beer
can
be
probably
one
of
the
best
of
its
ilk
delicious
all
the
way
around
from
the
hops
on
top
to
the
sweet
malt
and
the
heady
alcohol
sort
of
a
hopdevil
on
steroids
an
awesome
beer
and
thanks
again
to
shoreline
beverage
for
their
selection
gots
to
get
me
some
mo
dry
it
out
a
bit
and
itd
be
magnificent
very
cool
bottle
as
well
pours
a
clear
rubybrown
with
a
thick
light
brown
head
thick
sheets
of
lacing
down
the
side
of
the
glass
aroma
consists
of
citrusy
hops
malt
some
dark
fruit
dark
rum
and
has
a
sweetness
to
it
mediumbodied
mouthfeel
a
firm
bitterness
is
present
throughout
nice
caramel
malt
background
hop
bitterness
and
malt
flavor
seem
to
balance
each
other
out
rather
well
warming
alcohol
effect
is
noticed
as
the
ale
goes
down
excellently
crafted
i
only
wish
this
was
available
in
wisconsin
on
a
regular
basis
and
that
i
didnt
have
to
travel
2
hours
to
track
down
a
bottle
notes
absolutely
delicious
great
beer
worthy
of
me
overall
fantastically
complex
brew
and
quite
fantastic
overall
i
cant
imagine
drinking
a
ton
of
this
beer
its
certainly
not
a
session
brew
however
at
the
same
time
i
dont
think
i
could
ever
see
myself
leaving
a
drop
in
the
bottom
of
the
glass
in
all
an
extremely
hoppy
brew
and
yet
very
well
balanced
everytime
i
see
an
arrogant
bastard
brew
these
words
come
out
of
my
mouth
get
in
my
belly
with
a
fat
bastard
scottish
accent
from
the
22
oz
bottle
pours
a
dark
brown
slightly
red
when
held
up
to
light
beer
with
a
somewhat
foamy
offwhite
thickish
head
a
good
looking
beer
the
aroma
is
rather
mild
it
has
some
spiciness
to
it
but
is
fairly
unimpressive
nice
complex
tastesome
spiciness
but
also
tastes
of
sweet
malt
bitter
hops
and
fruit
becomes
more
flavorful
as
it
warms
and
the
complexity
really
comes
out
a
very
good
tasting
beer
fairly
smooth
and
drinkableoverall
a
pretty
good
beer
especially
in
terms
of
taste
although
it
does
not
seem
to
live
up
to
its
own
hype
on
the
label
which
i
guess
makes
sense
for
an
arrogant
bastard
a
great
brew
that
i
look
forward
to
enjoying
again
in
the
future
seriously
this
one
is
astounding
these
guys
have
to
be
stone
crazy
the
oakaged
arrogant
bastard
reviews
certainly
have
my
interest
at
this
point
the
fluid
malten
beast
classic
coke
just
made
a
new
fan
what
a
beer
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
but
the
label
should
have
scared
timid
beer
drinkers
aways
anyway
this
beer
poured
a
dark
amber
and
brown
body
with
a
chewy
thick
tan
head
the
nose
is
a
blast
of
thick
dripping
malt
toasted
caramel
biting
smokey
with
a
nice
citrus
hop
snap
the
flavors
are
full
bodied
roasted
malt
flavors
with
a
nice
balancing
faint
sweetness
which
is
then
slammed
by
a
slicing
hop
bitterness
a
true
joy
to
drink
i
just
wish
the
arrogant
one
was
available
in
wisconsin
when
someone
asks
what
is
american
style
beer
i
point
them
to
this
its
big
and
its
hoppy
pours
a
deep
burgundy
color
with
a
slight
haze
the
head
is
thick
and
never
goes
away
one
of
the
most
complex
beers
ive
ever
had
starts
out
sweet
with
the
taste
of
caramel
and
maple
syrup
and
finishes
with
the
intense
bitterness
of
chinook
hops
this
beer
is
best
as
a
sipping
beer
imo
rather
unbalanced
taste
will
appeal
to
hopslovers
the
alcohol
content
is
pretty
well
masked
and
could
really
sneak
up
on
the
unwary
drinker
this
is
an
intense
beer
that
really
grabs
you
by
your
tastebuds
arrogant
bastard
ale
fires
a
veritable
artillery
barrage
of
hops
at
the
drinker
not
the
first
beer
id
aim
at
a
person
who
only
drinks
macros
medium
full
bodied
unique
and
enjoyable
more
of
a
sipping
beer
for
yours
truly
but
one
i
will
certainly
seek
out
again
basically
the
label
says
it
all
this
is
an
aggressive
beer
so
very
bitter
and
complex
if
youre
not
paying
attention
all
of
the
wonderful
flavors
in
this
beer
will
fly
right
past
you
deffinatly
a
beer
to
take
your
time
with
wow
my
first
bomber
bottle
and
or
stone
first
of
all
great
bottle
both
the
info
and
humor
not
to
mention
the
attitude
the
brew
poured
a
ruby
red
with
a
nice
one
inch
tan
head
lace
was
very
nice
the
aroma
was
of
light
hop
grass
and
malt
background
taste
is
a
surprise
hop
overtone
bonanza
very
slight
malt
to
balance
this
very
smooth
and
drinkable
brew
the
mouth
is
left
tart
but
moist
not
a
dry
beer
hop
lingers
on
in
the
aftertaste
a
very
welldone
wellcrafted
brew
reminded
me
of
a
great
lakes
elliot
ness
a
little
citrus
and
barley
malt
tastes
great
when
this
beer
enters
your
mouth
not
a
drink
to
be
guzzled

alot
of
stuff
about
this

with
a

the
bitter
simply
refuses

but
so
what
this
beer
is
just
so
gimmicky
to
me
hops
are
great
for
adding
bitterness
and
aroma

dont

an

purchase
at

a

really
not
sure
what
i
was
thinking
but
its
rare
and
i
had
never
tried
it

this

is
solid
but
i
wouldnt
buy
it
again
unless
i
saw
it
on
sale
for
half
off
overall
one
really
tasty
brew
this
is
one
deep
complex
brew
that
makes
its

known
and
rules
over
your

buds
i
really
enjoyed
how
well
the
oak
shines
through
while
all
the
other
notes
duke
it
out
on
your
tongue
overall
this
is
alright
but
certainly
nothing
special
the
oak
is
a
touch
perfumelike
which
becomes
tiring
as
the
bottle
empties
an
okay
beer
from
a
brewery
that
makes
some
rather
good
stuff
happy
to
try
things
from

this
is
not

ive

its
worth
a

not

i
agree
with
the

theres

i
was

shocked
to
find
and
although
its
a
little
steep
in
the
pocket
book
it
lives
up
to
a
hard
earned
jackson
it
can
be
tough
to
find
but
when
you
do
give
it
a
shot
or
a
snifter
this
one
is
prettydarnedalright
didnt
know
what
to
expect
and
searched
the
ba
data
banks
for
an
inclination
of
what
to
expect
this
is
not
their
stout
but
a
rather
singular
aletype
of
version
it
is
similar
to
the
firestone
barrel
series
and
very
comparable
a
little
thicker
than
any
of
the
more
notable
firestone
editions
i
think
and
that
flies
in
the
face
of
the
eclipse
series
in
general
as
they
are
much
thinner
than
the
totality
stout
which
is
the
base
brew
for
the
eclipse
but
this
is
really
interesting
further
it
states
that
it
is
twelve
percent
rather
than
the
9
stated
at
the
top
of
tis
page
which
leads
me
to
wonder
anyway
decent
brew
not
as
smooth
and
refined
as
the
eclipse
series
but
very
decent
in
its
own
right
my
first
time
realizing
it
even
exists
after
searching
out
the
eclipses
the
last
two
years
its
a
little
rich
though
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
this
brew
is
quite
perplexing
at
times
it
kinda
has
a
mellow
black
ipa
kinda
feel
to
it
it
looks
like
a
stout
but
smellstastes
strong
of
american
barleywine
it
makes
sense
after
reading
the
blend
description
but
it
is
strange
how
the
stout
aspect
is
all
in
the
looks
and
the
barleywine
dominates
every
other
aspect
of
the
brew
except
the
aftertaste
hints
towards
stout
this
is
worth
trying
but
not
getting
crazy
over
unless
you
are
a
fan
of
boozy
black
ipas
then
it
is
worth
flipping
your
shit
over
thanks
david
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
after
having
it
on
tap
a
few
times
im
glad
i
got
to
sit
down
in
a
controlled
environment
and
really
enjoy
a
bottle
an
excellent
blend
i
am
amazed
at
how
well
these
aromas
and
flavors
play
together
everything
is
well
incorporated
the
name
says
it
all
barrel
aged
really
tasty
o
overall
decent
strong
ale
probably
not
worth
what
youd
have
to
give
up
to
get
it
not
my
favorite
beer
from
fiftyfifty
but
nothing
really
mindblowing
here
im
looking
forward
to
see
how
this
ages
in
the
next
year
or
so
as
i
have
one
bottle
left
decent
but
not
sure
id
seek
out
again
medium
bodied
with
a
really
strong
boozy
barrel
presence
that
dominates
the
flavor
almost
completely
obliterating
and
trace
of
a
base
beer
lots
of
toasted
oak
vanilla
spicy
rye
and
scorching
hot
booze
assaulting
the
palate
after
it
warms
up
considerably
there
is
some
subtle
hops
leathery
malt
and
dark
fruit
but
the
boozy
barrel
character
is
way
too
strong
this
brewery
usually
makes
really
good
barrel
aged
beers
but
this
turned
out
to
be
extremely
hot
and
one
dimensional
barts
decent
but
i
could
use
more
barrel
or
bourbon
interesting
blend
though
really
tasty
yes
barrelaged
no
fuller
body
well
carbonated
sticky
and
slightly
dry
on
the
tongue
with
a
lingering
effect
this
is
an
awesome
example
of
blending
style
bending
and
barrel
aging
i
had
the
opportunity
to
try
this
twice
but
i
still
wish
i
had
some
bottles
drink
incredibly
good
i
never
thought
i
would
get
to
try
this
one
thanks
scott
a
very
wonderul
beer
that
was
complex
and
layered
for
days
as
said
above
easier
to
take
down
than
a
regular
eclipse
although
i
am
a
bit
of
a
lightweight
the
smoothness
off
the
tap
make
this
stand
out
like
whoa
a
touch
of
heat
not
hot
with
a
above
medium
body
you
gotta
try
this
stuff
i
might
have
to

all
day
a
dollar
an
ounce
for
an
insanely
good
barrel
aged
product
cant
figure
out
how
something
like
this
with
so
much
diverse
flavor
from
different
component
beers
didnt
have
much
heat
and
didnt
really
fatigue
the
palate
this
was
a
great
beer
to
change
it
up
with
after
a
massive
palate
gauntlet
of
eclipse
barrel
aged
stuff
that
night
cant
wait
for
this
on
tap
j
this
was
quite
good
not
on
the
same
level
as
eclipse
but
with
a
bit
more
work
it
has
the
potential
to
be
glad
that
this
is
going
to
be
bottled
next
year
i
recently
just
had
this
on
tap
at
the
eclipse
prerelease
party
it
has
some
great
chocolate
oak
earthy
hop
bitterness
and
vanilla
notes
its
the
perfect
blend
of
stout
and
barleywine
the
bitterness
that
comes
from
the
barley
really
pulls
out
some
nice
citrusyness
that
plays
well
with
the
vanilla
and
oak
notes
overall
an
amazing
beer
sampled
at
the
2008
strong
ale
festival
was
excited
to
see
this
in
the
lineup
after
hearing
all
the
hype
from
the
bistro
barrel
aged
fest
consumed

from
notes
color
was
a
medium
brown
with
some
dark
orange
mixed
in
creamy
12

that
had
some

small
amount
of
lacing
also
aroma
was
filled
with
whiskey
roasted
malts
oak
dark
fruit
and
both
types
of
chocolate
flavor
was
a
little
dry
at
first
with
some
hops
carrying
over
from
the
barleywine
component
beer
gets
sweet
as
it
warms
with
the
fruit
and
malt
oaky
characteristics
keep
it
dry
enough
to
keep
things
in
check
bourbon
finish
is
smooth
but
a
little
funky
at
times
there
is
also
a
bit
of
earthiness
lingering
in
the
background
mouthfeel
is
sweet
and
fairly
smooth
body
is
on
the
thicker
side
even
after
barrel
aging
for
four
months
could
drink
a
few
glasses
of
this
especially
nice
in
the
winter
time
not
too
filling
i
did
not
know
a
barleywine
and
oatmeal
stout
could
blend
so
well
probably
would
have
been
better
without
the
jack

still
quite
enjoyable

oa
good
beer
might
not
be
worth

worthy
trying

must
be
the
sour
component
i
just
cant
wrap
my
palate
around
this
one
all
4
of
us
didnt
finish
our
pour
odd
because
i
liked
both
components
individually
not
a
good
blend
both
base
beers
are
outstanding
but
this
one
is
just
not
right
amazing
blend
of
two
of
the
bruerys
best
beers
this
beer
blew
my
mind
at
the
bruery
tap
room
very
bummed
they
werent
serving
growlers
of
it
5
star
thick
viscous
hybrid
black
tuesday
oude
tart
sour
both
beers
on
their
own
are
delicious
and
world
class
this
was
all
sorts
or
wrong
a
muddled
mess
whereas
no
flavors
from
each
beer
complimented
the
other
horrible
mouthfeel
for
any
addition
of
brett
to
a
beer
argueably
the
worst
craft
offering
ive
had
to
date
reddish
brown
and
nearly
flat
sour
notes
dominate
with
very
little
of
the
expected
malt
character
of
the
stout
showing
through
love
it
tasty
and
complex
unique
rich
for
a
sour
beer
bruery
is
my
shit
o
very
tasty
the
sour
flavors
from
the
oude
tart
dominate
the
black
tuesday
character
but
its
a
nice
blend
significantly
easier
to
drink
than
i
thought
it
might
be
recommended
this
most
likely
is
a
variation
of
an
oude
tart
this
one
however
has
a
strength
that
oude
tart
does
not
have
it
makes
it
somewhat
heady
but
very
enjoyable
at
the
same
time
this
could
be
a
regular
ale
with
a
bit
of
a
sour
hit
even
though
the
flavors
are
different
they
complement
each
other
very
well
this
is
medium
to
lighter
bodied
brew
with
a
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
this
is
strangely
2
beers
i
enjoy
on
their
own
but
sadly
no
good
aspects
of
either
come
out
in
the
blend
it
is
strangely
herbal
and
bitter
which
i
dont
remember
being
present
in
the
base
beers
i
would
not
be
quick
to
revisit
this
one
but
i
can
see
how
some
would
really
dig
it
2013

of

and
a
hint
of

is
great
but
leans
heavier
on
the
oude

with
crazy

some

in

i
cant
put
my
finger
on
that
i
assume
comes
from
the
black
tuesday
much
more
body
that
oude
tart
and
not
quite
as
much
lactic
tartness
still
sour
but
with
an
expected
big
sweetness
to
go
along
from
the
blend
plenty
of
carbonation
really
neat
blend
that
works
despite
sounding
totally
weird
o
mélagne
no
1
is
a
barrelaged
blend
of
oude
tart
and
black
tuesday
that
through
and
through
feels
more
like
oude
tart
with
a
splash
of
black
tuesday
than
a
blended
beer
sharp
cherry
skin
tartness
and
acidic
sourness
are
at
the
forefront
of
every
aspect
of
this
brew
chiseling
away
at
the
enamel
on
your
teeth
and
subduing
your
tongue
into
sourpower
submission
expanding
on
the
subtle
chocolate
and
brown
sugarlike
sweet
hints
of
black
tuesday
by
adding
a
considerable
amount
more
would
be
a
welcome
shift
in
the
beers
blend
really
opening
up
its
own
uniqueness
rather
than
a
feeling
like
a
halfassed
cuveé
but
but
you
wont
hear
me
complaining
about
drinking
this
sourashell
beer
its
exactly
what
i
live
for
it
could
just
be
better
a
blend
of
two
of
the
most
unique
and
delicious
beers
from
the
bruery
thanks
to
drlovemd87
for
busting
out
some
cellar
treats
for
our
new
years
eve
party
this
takes
everything
i
didnt
like
about
oude
tart
its
insane
acidity
its
front
of
tongue
focus
and
its
intense
carbonation
and
smooths
it
out
with
black
tuesday
one
of
the
best
big
stouts
going
the
chocolate
from
the
stout
balances
the
acid
quite
a
bit
and
its
relative
heaviness
settles
the
carbonation
down
enough
to
make
a
much
more
drinkable
let
alone
interesting
beverage
still
rather
red
in
color
i
wonder
what
percentage
the
blend
it
probably
not
fiftyfifty
i
think
its
a
little
oude
tart
heavy
as
the
cherry
notes
and
burgundy
sour
properties
come
through
more
i
think
in
nose
and
taste
than
the
bourbon
and
chocolate
notes
of
the
stout
although
those
are
what
tempers
the
intensity
of
oude
tart
and
makes
me
like
this
blend
better
than
it
a
lot
less
body
than
black
tuesday
on
its
own
the
balance
between
sour
and
sweet
is
right
on
the
money
and
the
layers
of
flavor
keep
coming
long
after
the
swallow
maybe
not
quite
as
cohesive
as
it
could
be
i
still
taste
both
beers
as
individuals
here
but
this
is
downright
awesome
beer
o
overall
its
a
highly
carbonated
blend
of
oude
tart
with
a
stout
but
hardly
recognizable
as
black
tuesday
having
anything
to
do
with
this
id
drink
it
again
but
not
a
whole
bottle
to
myself
as
others
have
mentioned
this
is
very
oude
tart
forward
but
has
a
nice
black
tuesday
backing
the
additional
body
roast
and
sweetness
imparted
from
the
stout
blend
well
with
the
tartness
of
the
flanders
red
worthy
popped
this
open
for
share
thanks
nate
about
an
8
oz
pour
pours
a
dark
brown

with
a
thin

is
tart
cherries
lacto
white
grapes
some
bourbon
vanilla
and
sweet
malts
taste
is
oudetart
forward
with
apples
grapes
cherries
and
other
sour
fruits
behind
these
flavors
are
the
big
base
of
black
tuesday
which
imparts
some
chocolate
bourbon
and
vanilla
honestly
though
the
black
tuesday
is
subdued
mouthfeel
is
medium
moderate
carbonation
fairly
smooth
overall
id
be
curious
to
know
the
proportions
of
the
blends
this
tastes
like
7525
oude
tart
regardless
it
works
well
i
really
loved
this
brew
o
a
very
nice
beer
the
sour
and
the
big
imperial
stout
play
off
of
each
other
nicely
i
would
be
interested
to
see
this
one
as
more
of
a
5050
blend
but
it
is
very
nice
as
is
overall
bt
seems
to
be
just
what
oude
tart
needed
to
bring
out
its
best
qualities
very
enjoyable
a
strange
complexity
that
i
never
fully
understood
but
enjoyed
trying
worth
seeking
out
as
its
unique
in
many
ways
i
can
smell
the
fruity
tartness
as
soon
as
i
wrangle
the
bottle
opener
through
the
wax
and
pop
the
top
tart
cherries
with
a
roasted
coffee
chocolate
and
caramel
background
light
oak
and
vanilla
mixed
with
spirits
the
flavor
feels
more
stout
like
than
the
aroma
lead
me
to
believe
a
solid
sweet
coffee
caramel
and
chocolate
with
a
hint
of
molasses
and
smoke
up
front
i
get
a
pleasant
dark
dried
fruitycherry
tartness
that
at
first
seems
to
belong
in
a
stout
but
the
tartness
builds
towards
the
end
of
every
sip
light
lactic
bite
and
little
to
no
hops
to
be
found
medium
body
with
a
moderate
to
high
level
of
carbonation
and
a
sweet
tart
almost
syrupy
mouthfeel
this
is
an
interesting
beer
it
is
certainly
unique
and
i
enjoyed
it
i
really
like
both
of
the
base
beers
in
this
blend
but
i
question
whether
the
sum
is
greater
than
the
parts
here
o
im
not
sure
how
it
falls
into
one
category
or
another
though
it
is
more
like
an
infected
stout
than
anything
else
i
think
that
they
put
too
much
oude
tart
in
here
my
issues
are
that
the
black
tuesday
does
mostly
nothing
but
add
a
slight
amount
of
aromaflavormouthfeel
exactly
what
it
is
advertised
as
a
perfect
blend
of
oude
tart
and
black
tuesday
very
tasty
and
unique
a
fantastic
blend
i
sincerely
wish
i
could
drink
this
whenever
i
chose
very
dark
with
a
tinge
of
red
subtle
sour
sweet
smell
very
nice
taste
i
like
melange
3
better
but
still
pretty
nice
i
would
say
i
enjoy
both
melange
1
and
3
better
than
straight
bt
with
this
beer
the
sourness
dominates
a
little
more
that
the
black
tuesday
cuts
some
of
the
sweetness
warms
up
nice
in
retrospect
would
have
loved
to
do
a
side
by
side
with
tarts
of
darkness
one
of
my
favorite
of
the
nights
the
only
beer
i
took
any
real
notes
on
pours
a
murky
dark
brown
with
a
tan
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
no
lacing
is
present
on
this
one
smell
is
quite
sour
funky
and
tart
with
some
vinegar
aromas
and
slight
cocoa
taste
is
sour
funky
and
tart
up
front
from
the
oude
tart
with
a
subtle
cocoa
flavor
on
the
finish
from
the
black
tuesday
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
but
the
oude
tart
is
the
more
dominant
beer
in
this
blend
as
blends
go
the
flavor
of
melange
1
is
a
little
too
far
toward
the
sour
side
of
its
ingredients
but
the
black
tuesday
does
a
nice
job
of
rounding
out
the
sours
rough
edges
and
it
feels
glorious
overall
this
was
a
pleasure
to
enjoy
and
experience
this
beer
when
this
was
first
released
i
read
that
the
black
tuesday
was
quite
dominant
but
with
over
a
year
of
age
on
this
now
the
sour
aspects
are
just
as
strong
maybe
even
more
dominant
i
am
not
totally
sold
on
this
beer
while
it
was
very
tasty
i
think
both
base
beers
are
better
on
their
own
definitely
worth
a
go
if
you
are
able
to
acquire
or
sample
on
draft
but
there
is
no
need
to
jump
over
hoops
to
track
it
down
recommended
but
not
one
i
ever
need
to
have
again
overall
not
crazy
about
the
blend
but
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
either
base
beer
pours
a
deep
ruddy
brown
high
tan
head
the
smell
is
sour
lots
of
herbal
and
tannic
notes
taste
is
very
sour
to
start
with
a
robust
chocolaty
character
as
it
warms
its
moderately
carbonated
thick
in
body
all
in
all
a
good
flemish
ale
though
not
a
great
stout
soy
saucewait
nofish
sauce
maybe
sweet
malty
chocolate
like
a
whopper
grotesquely
sour
rotten
cherries
and
raspberry
jam
gone
bad
if
it
can
go
bad
this
is
what
it
would
taste
like
vinegar
alcohol
well
hidden
with
a
quick
finish
this
was
pretty
bad
i
cant
believe
the
reviews
it
gets
gfunk
overall
very
drinkable
good
complexity
the
9
5
abv
was
well
hidden
dark
brown
with
a
brown
head
that
hangs
around
a
while
this
beer
looks
decent
the
nose
is
quite
dominated
by
the
oude
tart
in
fact
its
like
oude
tart
gone
wild
seriously
sour
acidic
acetic
and
vinegary
the
bugs
have
gobbled
up
all
the
black
tuesday
character
there
is
the
palate
is
sour
rather
exceedingly
so
with
a
sharp
vinegar
sourness
chocolate
mild
caramel
and
some
oak
very
sharp
theres
also
some
acetone
mediumfull
in
body
with
moderate
carbonation
this
is
too
sour
for
its
own
good
this
is
definitely
atrocious
and
split
7
ways
there
was
12
oz
remaining
and
at
25
a
pop
an
awful
experience
not
recommended
o
i
love
this
beer
and
i
am
very
thankful
to
have
more
of
it
this
is
going
to
be
a
beer
to
celebrate
with
and
drink
slowly
with
my
brothers
a
beautiful
blending
of
two
beers
that
manages
to
have
an
character
of
its
own
o
taste
is
much
better
than
the
aroma
good
fruit
unique
completely
different
than
base
beers
good
but
not
an
improvement
on
either
beer
pleasant
and
interesting
much
better
as
it
warms
up
another
big
thanks
to
my
buddy
chad
for
opening
another
great
and
rare
bottle
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
reddish
hue
it
has
an
offwhite
head
that
lingers
for
some
time
scent
is
tart
cherries
with
a
profound
vanilla
aroma
also
a
nice
amount
of
chocolate
cocoa
in
the
nose
taste
is
initially
sweet
chocolate
with
a
lot
of
oak
sweeter
than
i
was
expecting
in
the
middle
of
the
taste
it
gets
quite
sour
but
just
for
a
split
second
before
the
sour
fades
to
sweet
cherries
it
finishes
with
delightful
flavors
of
vanilla
and
oak
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
and
very
creamy
drinkability
is
very
high
as
there
is
no
trace
of
alcohol
flavors
overall
this
beer
is
very
unique
and
extremely
delicious
now
i
just
need
to
get
my
hands
on
some
black
tuesday
and
oude
tart
o
one
of
my
top
5
beers
thank
you
bruery
this
is
an
interesting
mix
of
dark
chocolate
malted
grain
character
somehow
piquant
but
subdued
tartness
and
ripe
fruitiness
i
wasnt
quite
to
sure
what
to
think
of
a
mix
of
imperial
stout
and
flanders
type
sour
and
i
still
dont
i
am
enjoying
it
though
even
though
the
right
side
of
my
brain
keeps
on
thinking
that
these
flavors
i
am
getting
cant
quite
possibly
work
together
but
my
left
side
says
that
they
do
this
beer
is
a
fascinating
experience
i
almost
want
to
describe
it
as
sloppy
genius
the
individual
components
certainly
dont
work
together
but
somehow
as
a
whole
they
do
this
could
have
been
a
complete
trainwreck
but
in
the
end
it
isnt
remotely
o
definitely
a
unique
beer
who
wouldve
thought
blending
a
sour
and
a
stout
i
guess
thats
the
direction
we
are
headed
in
definitely
a
good
brew
that
has
some
intense
and
interesting
flavor
combos
if
you
like
these
2
beers
definitely
seek
this
one
out
overall
interesting
lots
of
great
malt
flavors
blended
fairly
well
lots
of
dark
malts
roast
and
chocolate
with
a
little
sour
tart
fruit
mixed
in
there
bruery
mélange
1
last
pour
of
the
bottle
and
holding
up
next
to
the
first
pour
of
the
bottle
is
night
and
day
totally
different
colors
mine
is
yeasty
and
thick
looking
whereas
the
first
pour
is
dark
and
gorgeous
so
thick
you
can
see
the
sediment
floating
around
smell
is
really
nice
sweet
tart
smell
smells
really
good
sweet
tarts
but
balanced
so
that
your
mouth
waters
for
a
taste
taste
is
to
die
for
simplevery
solid
sour
been
drinking
a
lot
of
sours
today
but
this
is
a
nice
highlight
mouth
is
smooth
as
day
is
long
there
is
no
puckering
on
this
sour
which
is
really
nice
but
there
is
still
a
very
strong
sour
flavor
solid
tasting
brew
it
is
fantastic
this
is
another
confused
beer
surprisingly
the
oude
tart
flavors
almost
completely
take
over
the
robust
black
tuesday
ones
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
sour
dark
beers
and
this
doesnt
chance
my
mind
one
bit
too
much
sour
and
not
enough
stout
in
this
one
im
glad
to
have
had
this
but
not
nearly
worth
the
trouble
i
would
drink
this
again
but
no
way
would
i
be
able
to
consume
a
750ml
bottle
overall
very
strange
tastes
a
bit
like
oude
tart
followed
by
a
black
tuesday
chaser
in
the
end
this
doesnt
really
do
either
beer
much
justice
a
noble
effort
but
melange
1
as
a
beer
is
less
than
the
sum
of
its
respective
parts
still
its
working
with
some
pretty
good
parts
overall
this
is
a
nice
beer
but
i
prefer
both
black
tuesday
and
oude
tart
to
this
its
a
very
interesting
mix
though
but
i
find
that
im
unable
to
quaff
it
like
i
do
black
tuesday
the
darkest
pour
with
a
huge
tan
head
that
just
drops
all
over
the
sides
of
the
glass
and
leaves
an
enormous
amount
of
lacing
the
first
smell
is
simply
stunning
as
a
rich
dark
stout
comes
forward
with
loads
of
chocolate
coffee
and
roasted
malts
which
gets
wrapped
around
raspberries
cherries
and
tart
cherries
that
are
simlply
everywhere
what
a
wonderfull
blend
of
flavor
when
you
get
fruits
and
deep
roasted
malts
together
just
stunning
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
had
in
a
while
whay
a
weekend
massive
thanks
to
beeruser
for
sharing
this
one
at
one
of
our
weekly
tastings
served
from
bottle
into
a
mikkeller
flute
poured
a
massively
dark
brown
with
a
red
hue
while
being
almost
black
if
that
makes
any
sense
with
a
two
finger
light
tan
head
that
subsided
slowly
to
one
finger
maintained
decent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
sour
tart
and
diacetyl
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
sour
tart
cherries
butterscotch
and
brown
sugar
it
had
a
medium
feel
on
the
palate
with
high
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
great
brew
without
a
doubt
just
imagine
you
get
a
black
tuesday
that
is
infected
in
a
good
way
that
is
pretty
much
this
beer
the
flavors
going
on
here
really
compliment
each
other
really
well
and
makes
this
one
very
easy
on
the
palate
and
keeps
you
coming
back
for
me
it
also
helps
that
the
aroma
is
quite
excellent
as
well
get
this
on
your
palate
o
overall
i
liked
this
one
and
thought
it
was
a
pretty
cool
beer
i
still
prefer
the
normal
ot
and
bt
versions
to
this
one
but
i
think
its
a
pretty
cool
idea
that
worked
well
overall
definitely
worth
checking
out
as
its
very
interesting
o
quite
good
interesting
combination
of
flavors
that
give
a
nice
dessert
and
candy
like
flavor
profile
seems
like
this
is
a
vast
majority
oude
tart
with
a
splash
of
black
tuesday
mixed
in
definitely
glad
i
have
another
bottle
of
this
one
left
in
the
cellar
to
explore
at
a
later
time
kudos
to
patrick
rue
for
his
impressive
ingenuity
and
creativity
the
marriage
of
these
two
beers
was
once
incomprehensible
to
me
and
now
i
find
myself
longing
for
more
cheers
beer
is
creamy
and
wonderful
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
the
black
tuesday
comes
through
nicely
and
the
sourness
from
the
oude
tart
comes
through
to
it
shouldnt
work
together
but
it
does
chocolate
cherry
tartness
sweet
malt
bourbon
nice
id
have
it
again
if
only
there
were
possible
funny
i
thought
black
tuesday
was
so
awesome
and
still
do
and
yet
every
variation
of
it
ive
loved
even
more
just
keep
cranking
em
out
bruery
love
em
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
small
creamy
tan
head
and
some
spotty
lacing
on
the
way
down
the
nose
brings
forward
a
bit
of
chocolate
and
molasses
behind
that
is
brown
sugar
and
a
good
amount
of
bourbon
plus
a
strong
oak
and
cherry
cherry
mild
dark
fruits
a
good
dosing
of
acidity
the
flavor
carried
a
strong
cherry
presence
that
actually
overwhelmed
the
black
tuesday
portion
by
just
a
bit
nice
thick
roasty
and
chocolate
stout
paired
with
a
cherry
sourness
description
is
dead
on
perhaps
a
bit
too
acidic
in
the
finish
as
it
didnt
quite
gel
with
the
full
creamy
body
at
least
thats
where
i
stand
glad
i
have
a
bottle
of
this
and
looking
forward
to
seeing
how
it
ages
out
o
one
of
the
more
bewildering
offerings
ive
encountered
as
of
late
d
nothing
really
wrong
with
this
beer
but
i
think
that
the
component
parts
are
more
impressive
on
their
own
doesnt
have
the
refreshing
crisp
body
and
sourness
of
oude
tart
nor
the
decadence
of
black
tuesday
o
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
one
im
a
huge
fan
of
would
rather
have
the
base
beers
than
the
blend
maybe
some
more
bt
would
have
made
it
more
interesting
i
am
loving
this
a
clever
blend
going
for
that
chocolate
covered
cherry
thing
well
done
bruery
folks
750ml

at
daks
final
four
tasting
pours
a
hazy
dark
caramel
with
offwhite
head
around
is
sour
with
cherries
and
chocolate
taste
follows
suit
with
sweetness
from
black
tuesday
and
sour
from
oude
tart
medium
bodied
with
a
slick
texture
this
is
a
super
beer
11212013
update
of
2013
vintage
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
regardless
of
style
4
5
overall
overall
i
was
fairly
impressed
with
this
beer
i
wasnt
really
sure
how
this
blend
was
going
to
work
out
but
the
bruery
pulled
it
off
nicely
i
definitely
went
back
for
a
second
glass
goes
down
pretty
easy
and
gets
better
as
it
warms
it
would
be
nice
to
see
the
bt
come
through
just
a
bit
more
but
im
not
really
complaining
worth
seeking
out
d
the
label
on
the
bottle
says
that
this
is
best
enjoyed
with
friends
but
i
say
its
great
to
have
friends
around
just
keep
drinking
your
multra
and
stay
away
from
my
25
kickass
rare
bottle
of
beer
i
can
drink
the
whole
thing
myself
fullbodied
with
slight
acidity
and
mediumlow
carbonation
a
really
enjoyable
beer
as
strange
as
it
is
overall
i
like
oude
tart
and
i
like
bt
but
i
dont
like
this
mix
the
proportion
was
too
much
in
the
oude
tart
favor
i
didnt
particularly
care
for
it
as
i
would
rather
have
the
base
beers
by
themselves
drink
who
would
think
that
the
guys
at
bruery
would
think
to
put
this
out
they
did
and
its
awesome
on
tap
at
the
bruery
reserve
initiation
party
2011
pours
a
tan
murky
brown
with
a
slight
tan
head
being
a
mix
of
black
tuesday
and
oude
tart
it
pretty
much
does
look
like
what
i
imagine
it
would
if
you
mixed
the
two
together
the
smell
if
actually
kind
of
funky
with
a
very
different
blend
between
roasted
malt
chocolate
and
oak
with
a
fruity
sour
quality
interesting
to
say
the
least
medium
mouthfeel
with
good
carbonation
the
flavor
is
good
given
the
odd
blend
of
these
2
beers
starts
with
some
roasted
notes
with
caramel
and
chocolate
that
quickly
transition
to
some
fruity
tartness
surprisingly
balanced
in
my
opinion
not
sure
how
they
make
this
work
but
it
works
a
very
interesting
and
enjoyable
beer
im
looking
forward
to
bottles
of
this
d
i
have
mixed
feelings
about
this
one
i
liked
it
but
it
didnt
really
wow
me
nonetheless
an
interesting
blend
and
experiment
mouthfeel
is
nicely
chewy
and
bubbly
draught
at
the
bruerys
anniversary
almost
black
dark
brown
color
with
a
small
beige
head
sour
fruit
and
mild
chocolate
aroma
the
flavor
starts
moderately
tart
giving
way
to
a
malty
chocolate
finish
fizzy
carbonation
and
a
mediumfull
body
the
flemish
sourness
starts
things
off
well
but
the
transition
to
the
sweeter
more
malty
stout
doesnt
seem
to
flow
very
well
not
bad
at
all
but
not
seamlessly
put
together
either
another
tasty
surprise
from
patrick
co
one
can
only
wish
that
the
insane
sours
coming
out
of
this
place
will
be
bottled
someday
highly
recommended
d
i
was
very
surprised
by
this
beer
it
was
unique
complex
and
entertaining
it
may
not
be
a
long
session
beer
but
it
is
one
that
belongs
in
the
stash
for
sharing
with
good
friends
i
talked
to
patrick
before
leaving
and
he
said
that
this
blend
consisted
of
23
of
the
base
blend
for
his
flemish
red
and
13
of
their
russian
imperial
stout
neither
of
the
beers
are
ready
according
to
the
brewers
by
themselves
anyways
they
are
cool
guys
and
you
should
try
these
beers
as
soon
as
possible
being
that
i
have
not
been
disappointed
by
one
yet
if
this
is
bottled
i
will
being
some
and
drinking
more
recommended
if
they
still
have
some
around
dark
body
black
the
coffee
tan
head
on
top
is
the
highlight
of
the
appearance
and
sits
on
top
for
a
long
time
the
aroma
was
cheesy
at
first
but
that
cleared
up
to
be
freshpicked
strawbeeries
the
taste
is
dominant
of
fruit
lots
of
strawberry
in
here
bits
of
pinneapple
a
dash
of
coffee
bean
the
fruitness
isnt
intense
nothing
too
tart
and
the
flavors
are
in
harmony
with
one
another
i
could
sip
on
this
for
a
while
and
one
i
would
like
to
drink
again
d
the
bruery
continues
to
impress
this
is
a
very
tasty
blend
the
flavours
work
quite
well
together
only
available
at
the
bruery
right
now
good
stuff
super
smooth
beer
considering
alcohol
nice
sweetness
to
this
didnt
taste
barrel
aging
but
it
didnt
matter
very
good
2012
bottle
on
32715
unbelievably
tasty
beer
introduced
to
to
some
new
craft
beer
guys
lots
of
booze
smell
but
super
balanced
flavor
mostly
caramel
flavor
some
chocolate
and
boise
but
so
balanced
great
beer
they
performed
well
this
blend
it
is
a
concentrate
of
roasted
and
bourbon
flavors
it
is
sure
sweet
which
is
a
characteristic
of
their
brand
but
it
is
one
of
the
few
exceptions
i
applause
on
tap
at
the
bruery
poured
into
minisnifter
which
would
prove
to
be
plenty
appearance
is
dark
reddishbrown
with
a
tan
head
streaks
and
minimal
lacing
which
is
not
unexpected
for
such
a
high
abv
beer
aroma
is
powerful
butterscotch
vanilla
toffee
cocoa
bourbon
heat
roasted
malt
dark
fruit
brown
sugar
and
oak
taste
is
very
sweet
with
toffee
vanilla
and
fig
up
front
some
oaky
bitterness
but
not
balanced
whatsoever
and
heat
but
less
than
the
15
on
the
bottle
prepared
me
for
a
sipper
certainly
due
to
both
booze
and
sweetness
full
bodied
thick
slightly
oily
texture
low
carbonation
sweet
warming
finish
mild
bourbon
nice
vanilla
some
dark
fruits
little
bit
of
chocolate
2011
bottle
definitely
showing
its
age
but
still
very
tasty
milkshake
brown
color
toffee
cinnamon
boozy
flavoraroma
tiny
amount
of
vinegar
comes
through
but
it
sort
of
adds
to
the
overall
experience
not
bad
but
still
too
much
for
me
all
of
the
bruery
stouts
are
a
bit
crazy
just
dont
expect
big
notes
of
black
tuesday
of
the
three
base
beers
the
anniversary
ale
is
the
dominant
drinks
closer
to
sucre
than
anything
else
overall
really
really
good
lots
of
complexity
and
intensity
its
a
huge
beer
brown
sugar
caramel
cinnamon
vanilla
boozy
sweetness
almost
a
jammy
quality
people
say
this
is
too
sweet
but
i
think
the
alcohol
cuts
through
and
balances
it
then
again
i
dont
mind
sweetness
for
such
a
big
beer
it
doesnt
feel
sticky
no
alcohol
burn
think
i
preferred
fruet
to
this
but
barely
decent
small
head
with
a
dark
leather
brown
body
aroma
is
of
sweet
bourbon
taste
is
deep
brown
sugar
caramel
strong
maple
tones
almost
no
carbonation
which
kills
the
mood
a
bit
but
overall
very
enjoyable
nonetheless
o
amazingly
complex
beer
a
bit
on
the
boozier
side
but
still
a
nice
sipper
pours
a
transparent
rust
color
and
aroma
suggests
a
ba
barleywine
the
booze
is
strong
definitely
a
sipping
beer
to
share
with
friends
lots
of
wine
barrel
flavors
with
the
sweet
bourbon
profile
is
nice
but
not
what
i
expected
i
get
a
lot
of
pineearthy
flavors
deeper
into
the
pour
but
the
sweetness
is
intense
almost
too
intense
still
a
beer
to
be
appreciated
and
shared
overall
very
good
to
great
beer
but
i
think
the
booze
knocks
it
down
a
notch
definitely
worth
a
try
if
you
dont
mind
the
hit
to
the
wallet
but
i
could
see
how
some
one
could
pass
on
this
deliciousness
a
bit
sweet
some
bourbon
comes
through
but
its
tough
to
overcome
the
creamy
sweetness
here
o
just
a
huge
beer
that
has
a
lot
of
complex
flavors
i
thought
it
would
be
slightly
darker
and
more
roasty
but
it
really
does
not
disappoint
world
class
flavor
o
i
enjoyed
this
one
it
was
a
surprisingly
easy
driver
for
such
a
huge
beer
nothing
id
always
need
on
hand
but
a
nice
blend
for
sure
glad
to
have
tried
it
finally
in
a
few
words
a
complete
mess
silly
abv
cloying
bomb
of
sweet
syrupy
alcohol
that
rockets
then
crash
lands
in
spectacular
disunion
a
blend
not
worth
a
celebration
a
bottle
worthy
of
the
drain
not
good
overall
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
i
know
every
nonsour
barrelaged
beer
from
the
bruery
seems
to
be
a
crapshoot
these
days
and
i
must
admit
to
some
reservations
knowing
that
melange
no
3
included
a
portion
of
white
oak
sap

cant

but
honestly
i
will
start
off
by
saying
that
this
is
by
far
their
best
beer
to
date
and
one
of
the
better
ones
i
have
ever
had
period
oak
roasted
and
bready
malts
in
the
middle
mixed
with
vanilla
and
oak
and
tangy
mouthfeel

a

offering
not
mind
blowing
thanks
sunkistxsudafed
for
the
opportunity
served
in
a
tulip
at
wob
tempe
surprised
me
with
its
power
and
then
its
flavor
a
delicious
craft
that
reflects
bourbon
barrel
aging
without
overpowering
booze
taste
a
belgian
character
without
being
a
belgian
beer
will
order
again
and
again
i
feel
the
9
percent
without
tasting
it
o
this
is
a
solid
barley
wine
but
i
dont
know
why
its
not
advertised
that
way
the
1
pint
6fl
is
probably
a
bit
too
much
i
would
prefer
this
if
it
were
in
a
4
pack
12oz
much
like
old
stock
ale
which
i
would
recommend
before
this
beer
a
real
showcase
of
bourbon
barrels
here
tons
of
vanilla
sweetness
wood
and
warming
alcohol
in
this
brick
red
colored
brew
with
extraordinary
depth
shortish
off
white
head
caps
off
a
dark
and
intriguing
brew
the
nose
here
is
heavily
oaked
with
notes
of
dried
cherries
and
brown
sugar
i
smell
a
little
alcohol
too
but
nothing
out
of
place
sweeter
red
malt
starts
the
flavor
trip
but
its
mellowed
nicely
by
all
the
oak
which
now
gets
a
bit
more
nuanced
with
char
must
and
tremendous
vanilla
character
layers
of
grain
and
wood
compliment
each
other
well
and
all
the
residual
sugar
i
anticipated
from
the
nose
is
about
gone
or
at
least
not
slowing
this
down
at
all
a
very
cool
beer
soaked
with
rich
bourbon
flavors
but
still
being
rather
drinkable
i
could
take
down
a
bomber
of
this
without
a
worry
decadent
mouthfeel
with
just
a
tickle
of
booze
and
a
very
long
finish
like
warm
bread
pudding
one
of
marbles
best
beers
i
hope
they
make
it
back
to
colorado
before
long
i
think
they
have
all
brought
something
unique
to
the
table
o
a
good
beer
and
one
i
enjoyed
but
i
also
would
have
like
more
expression
on
the
nose
the
taste
was
great
and
i
only
expect
more
character
from
the
bottles
that
i
age
216th
pours
a
clear
orangered
with
a
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
small
cap
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
caramel
toffee
and
slight
bourbon
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
caramel
and
bourbon
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
woody
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
i
think
the
barrel
aged
presence
is
slightly
better
in
the
taste
o
overall
not
a
bad
beer
the
appearance
was
exceptional
but
everything
else
was
just
solid
bit
boozy
and
sweet
glad
to
try
it
but
not
blown
away
like
i
had
thought
i
would
be
pours
a
dark
amber
with
garnet
accents
capped
by
a
cream
colored
two
finger
head
huge
amount
of
gobs
of
splotchy
lacing
a
bouquet
of
dark
fruit
underlying
oakiness
light
bourbon
accents
and
vanilla
on
the
nose
dates
upfront
hints
of
plum
and
currants
joined
by
caramel
and
toffee
notes
midpalate
finishes
with
a
bit
of
apple
peel
a
bit
of
hop
bitterness
and
bourbon
soaked
oak
big
full
body
syrupy
but
lightened
by
some
fluffy
creaminess
this
really
is
a
fantastic
brew
if
you
have
the
means
make
sure
to
acquire
a
bottle
o
great
beer
glad
i
got
to
try
it
not
available
here
sent
on
a
recommendation
in
a
trade
for
bba
stouts
glad
i
tried
it
would
cellar
one
if
i
had
it
overall
a
nice
bourbon
beer
still
a
bit
on
the
sweet
and
boozy
side
but
had
some
interesting
flavors
overall
not
spectacular
but
very
good
marble
is
getting
better
at
these
barrel
aged
beers
id
take
their
barrel
aged
imperial
stout
over
this
but
its
definitely
worth
trying
wonderful
overall
beer
very
heavy
vanilla
smell
and
taste
pours
think
smells
great
but
if
vanilla
isnt
your
thing
dont
come
near
this
good
alcohol
burn
that
is
masked
well
with
the
creamy
sweetness
split
it
dont
tackle
this
by
yourself
i
fear
that
it
would
be
similar
to
going
after
a
pint
of
ice
cream
taste
great
with
regrets
later
o
overall
im
really
impressed
with
the
value
here
12
for
this
beer
is
amazing
its
got
great
flavor
and
honestly
thats
where
this
one
shines
mouthfeel
and
nose
are
less
than
impressive
but
the
abv
and
flavor
notes
are
great
could
use
just
a
touch
more
rounding
not
sure
i
could
drink
a
ton
of
this
but
very
glad
i
tried
it
ill
grab
another
to
see
what
it
does
in
time
beware
this
brew
packs
a
serious
punch
awesome
brew
marble
just
awesome
overall
this
is
delicious
it
is
definitely
trying
to
be
backwoods
bastard
which
is
fine
its
not
as
good
as
the
aforementioned
favorite
but
its
very
good
and
probably
mislabeled
here
as
an
american
strong
ale
must
try
cheers
thanks
quirkzoo
for
another
new
beer
in
this
great
bif
ive
been
on
a
goodbeer
roll
thats
really
going
to
dent
my
reputation
as
a
crank
i
need
to
choose
something
shitty
soon
this
isnt
it
morphed
from
good
to
excellent
as
it
warmed
very
nice
cant
wait
to
try
the
stout
d
if
it
werent
for
that
unknown
bite
this
would
be
great
i
have
a
second
bottle
im
going
to
age
and
i
hope
in
a
year
or
two
when
i
try
it
again
that
sting
will
be
eliminated
a
deep
and
complex
brew
nicely
put
together
and
a
pleasure
to
drink
ill
be
looking
for
some
more
bottles
to
sip
on
during
the
upcoming
colder
months
22oz
bottle
purchased
on
sale
for
9
99
wasnt
sure
about
this
one
but
it
was
quite
solid
red
color
decent
ring
of
bubbles
aroma
is
real
nice
brown
sugar
bourbon
barrels
hint
of
alcohol
flavor
follows
the
nose
closely
oak
vanilla
good
stuff
this
feels
like
an
old
ale
or
barleywine
and
it
sort
of
reminds
me
of
abacus
and
blighs
in
a
way
but
it
falls
just
a
bit
short
still
for
10
it
was
well
worth
the
money
not
as
tasty
as
expected
good
but
not
great
and
absolutely
not
worth
what
boulders
charged
me
for
it
the
pour
is
amber
in
color
with
a
small
offwhite
head
has
a
pretty
nice
nose
on
it
good
bourbon
and
vanilla
with
plenty
of
oak
and
brown
sugar
a
nice
caramel
sweetness
to
go
with
some
hints
of
dark
fruit
the
flavor
is
nice
but
not
quite
as
much
so
as
the
aroma
a
bit
thin
with
brown
sugar
toffee
and
dark
fruit
notes
some
bourbon
and
vanilla
but
not
the
same
level
of
intensity
as
the
nose
had
after
the
marble
ba
imperial
stout
josh
brought
last
time
i
had
high
hopes
for
this
brew
its
still
nice
though
not
nearly
as
impressive
but
who
can
blame
a
ba
for
buying
a
nicelooking
waxed
bottle
o
nice
beer
that
has
good
barrel
aged
characteristics
wanted
to
give
this
a
4
25
for
taste
so
i
made
up
with
it
for
a
4
5
overall
great
under
the
radar
brew
barrel
aging
meld
pretty
damn
well
thanks
egrace84
overall
i
really
enjoyed
the
caramel
and
vanilla
bourbon
notes
this
brewery
is
two
for
two
as
far
as
im
concerned
i
would
definitely
have
another
overall
drinkability
this
was
pretty
good
but
abbey
darkness
is
better
overall
another
exceptional
seasonal
release
this
is
one
which
ages
gracefully
but
is
also
exceptional
fresh
the
beer
is
transparent
and
fairly
dark
brown
with
a
quarter
inch
or
so
of
tan
head
that
leaves
some
decent
lacing
on
the
snifter
the
aroma
brings
caramels
malt
oak
booze
nice
flavor
with
a
prominent
oak
barrel
presence
throughout
vanilla
and
bourbon
impart
a
lasting
sweetness
that
is
balanced
by
a
tannic
oaky
character
medium
bodied
and
creamy
overall
a
solid
beer
and
a
nice
surprise
as
this
beer
wasnt
on
my
radar
recommended
beer
is
medium
in
body
and
good
hides
the
alcohol
well
in
a
malt
backbone
that
dominates
the
beer
the
finish
isnt
too
bitter
or
dry
a
nice
bodied
beer
with
good
connectivity
id
have
ti
again
pours
brown
with
a
nice
tan
head
average
lacing
and
a
bit
of
a
collar
on
the
way
down
the
nose
carries
caramel
with
some
bourbon
and
oak
notes
in
the
background
the
flavor
focuses
on
the
oak
bourbon
barrel
character
and
also
presents
a
touch
of
vanilla
average
duration
of
the
flavor
through
the
finish
with
some
slight
sweetness
and
a
relativelyfull
creamy
mouthfeel
well
done
my
bottle
neck
was
dipped
in
black
wax
and
the
date
was
121410
i
bought
it
in
santa
fe
last
summer
so
it
must
be
a
year
old
this
is
a
great
beer
i
consider
myself
fortunate
to
have
gotten
my
hands
on
it
and
would
happily
have
another
if
given
the
opportunity
o
very
much
enjoyed
this
one
d
very
drinkable
it
seems
like
time
is
definitely
on
this
beers
side
ill
sit
on
my
last
one
for
a
few
more
months
and
then
try
it
all
over
again
i
cant
wait
overall
this
was
very
tasty
id
never
heard
of
this
brewery
and
i
had
to
put
my
sunglasses
on
to
mask
the
tears
welling
up
in
my
eyes
when
i
beheld
my
empty
glass
my
voice
betrayed
me
cracking
a
few
times
as
i
tried
to
speak
in
false
hearty
tones
about
all
the
great
sours
on
the
list
i
was
looking
forward
to
trying
i
was
unable
to
hide
my
sorrow
so
i
eventually
sat
silently
and
braced
myself
as
grief
consumed
me
good
on
you
guys
marble
still
not
sure
this
was
quite
worth
the
price
tag
ive
had
beers
just
as
good
in
the
910
range
but
its
damned
good
and
not
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
like
it
seems
all
of
the
english
old
ales
ive
tried
have
been
my
one
tiny
complaint
would
be
that
the
dark
fruits
from
the
aroma
did
not
carry
into
the
flavor
terribly
well
but
that
seems
to
be
par
for
the
course
d
wow
best
bourbon
woodaged
beer
i
have
ever
tasted
hesitated
buying
bc
i
have
never
even
been
able
to
come
close
to
finishing
a
bourbon
beer
this
one
i
could
drink
all
night
or
until
i
pass
out
fantastic
beer
this
was
my
first
time
having
the
highly
regarded
marble
reserve
and
i
really
couldnt
be
happier
its
in
the
same
field
as
angels
share
or
fw14
which
are
two
of
my
favorite
beers
but
much
liter
in
color
and
body
and
therefore
is
really
unique
to
me
drinkability
is
high
but
im
going
at
it
slow
because
this
is
such
a
complex
and
intriguing
beer
i
have
had
a
decent
amount
of
beer
that
spent
time
in
various
barrels
wine
bourbon
etc
but
this
is
unlike
any
other
beer
i
have
tried
it
would
be
damn
near
perfect
if
it
werent
for
the
higher
alcohols
that
are
still
present
drinkability
4
05
0
price
tag
is
a
big
high
which
makes
this
a
very
delicious
but
occasional
treat
age
has
been
kind
to
this
one
it
still
has
a
lot
of
bourbon
flavor
and
significant
heat
but
the
sweetness
has
diminished
and
new
notes
of
roasted
nuts
dates
and
marzipan
are
emerging
the
flavors
are
meshing
together
nicely
this
beer
is
more
like
an
old
ale
than
it
was
2
years
ago
the
mouthfeel
has
lost
much
of
the
grainy
roughness
it
had
the
first
time
i
tried
it
and
is
now
almost
oily
i
wish
i
had
another
bottle
this
vintage
tastes
like
it
could
easily
go
another
couple
years
pours
an
opaque
black
with
a
foamy
dark
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
partial
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
slowly
drip
into
the
remaining
beer
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
dark
roasted
malt
cocoa
char
and
fruit
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
cocoa
cookie
dough
and
slight
fruit
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
roast
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
with
solid
cocoa
and
fruit
aspects
but
i
am
not
getting
any
of
the
belgian
yeast
they
supposedly
used
in
this
one
well
my
12ounce
bottle
states
the
brewery
as
being
thomas
creek
of
south
carolina
and
the
label
is
a
little
different
than
the
one
shown
here
but
my
research
doesnt
come
up
with
much
evidence
and
it
doesnt
seem
worth
distinguishing
any
differences
here
so
it
pours
a
deep
opaque
black
color
with
a
giant
head
of
tan
foam
that
settles
to
a
solid
layer
but
minimal
lacing
the
aroma
emits
a
pleasant
fruit
malt
idea
perhaps
hinting
of
the
alleged
pomegranate
the
flavor
is
somewhat
striking
but
also
difficult
to
describe
there
is
very
little
of
the
familiar
malt
characteristics
i
expect
from
something
labeled
a
black
ale
especially
an
imperial
black
ale
theres
a
boozy
fruit
idea
again
arguably
pomegranate
and
apple
that
seems
to
fight
with
the
slightly
chocolate
malt
base
it
just
doesnt
blend
well
its
medium
bodied
with
a
smooth
initial
feel
but
the
sodalike
fizziness
takes
over
and
ends
with
an
unfriendly
result
that
includes
some
chalkiness
the
aftertaste
is
similarly
poor
with
an
odd
vegetablelike
bite
and
evidence
of
some
alcohol
disappointing
good
but
not
great
opaque
reddish
black
with
a
dark
tan
head
no
lacing
a
lot
of
malty
chocolatey
notes
and
not
a
ton
of
hops
a
decent
imperial
black
but
i
was
really
hoping
to
taste
more
pomegranate
it
becomes
just
barely
noticeable
after
warming
to
near
room
temp
maybe
fresh
or
aged
in
any
case
i
would
drink
it
again
so
above
average
they
seemed
to
indicate
this
was
a
ibaabacda
but
whatever
solid
black
pour
into
a
mack
house
goblet
a
finger
or
so
of
foamy
tan
head
that
never
completely
dissipated
and
left
a
bit
of
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
of
chocolate
malts
a
tad
roasty
and
leathery
hints
of
pine
needles
and
dark
fruit
dark
malts
up
front
in
the
taste
complimented
by
notes
of
dark
chocolate
and
coffee
a
touch
of
resinous
hops
and
a
welldefined
pomegranate
finish
that
left
a
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
to
offset
the
otherwise
unexpected
smoothness
of
the
beer
body
was
medium
if
this
was
indeed
a
cda
it
was
one
of
the
most
mellow
ive
had
as
far
as
hopsbitterness
goes
a
good
drinker
overall
though
it
seems
that
fresh
and
on
tap
is
the
way
to
go
with
this
one
three
finger
tan
head
reminiscent
of
a
root
beer
float
on
a
jet
black
body
aroma
of
brown
sugar
candy
sugar
roasted
malts
chili
peppers
and
chocolate
flavors
of
roasted
malt
dark
chocolate
coffee
beans
candy
sugar
oily
thick
body
and
moderate
carbonation
dark
fruit
notes
include
plum
raisins
and
prunes
not
too
bad
good
flavors
but
they
seem
disorganized
worth
trying
as
it
seems
u
will
either
love
it
or
find
it
not
too
memorable
this
was
a
fine
oneoff
beer
however
recommended
for
dessert
while
it
warms
well
it
is
clearly
better
cold
this
bottle
aged
three
years
o
i
loved
it
its
very
unique
and
enjoyalble
i
suggest
having
it
on
tap
in
thier
tasting
room
much
better
than
the
bottles
httpwww

comkajiisbeerreviews
overall
this
is
an
average
strong
beer
it
actually
is
an
ok
drink
it
isnt
bad
and
it
isnt
good
i
dont
see
myself
drinking
this
one
again
but
im
sort
of
glad
i
experienced
it
overall
not
bad
at
all
a
black
ale
with
some
tart
fruitiness
different
and
enjoyable
eh
it
was
fun
to
try
ill
review
the
other
of
theirs
soon
enough

im
fine
with
having
tried
this
but
sure
glad
i
got
it
in
a
mixed
6
rather
than
committing
to
a
full
6
pack
ill
credit
it
with
being
unlike
anything
else
ive
had
and
for
that
give
it
a
slight
point
boost
overall
but
the
flavors
never
quite
found
a
harmony
worth
a
try
but
not
worth
a
hunt
i
guess
this
is
considered
extreme
its
really
all
over
the
place
sometimes
it
works
sometimes
not
give
credit
for
being
different
12
oz

guy
shipped
to
me
by

his
business
tripa

pours

a
very
fizzy
and
fast
dissipating
headall
gone
nose
is
a
bit
chocolate
and
maltyand
maybe
a
bit
old
taste
is
malty
chocolate
and
very
carbonated
especially
for
such
a
dark
beer
alcohol
is
just
a
bit
present
not
bad
but
overall
pretty
much
an
average
beer
leaves
me
thinking
that
this
style
has
seen
better
days
it
makes
me
glad
i
live
in
fl
o
i
kinda
liked
it
the
juxtaposition
of
styles
reminded
me
of
a
hybrid
lambicenglish
southern
mild
approach
in
the
beer
it
isnt
what
a
lot
of
people
expect
which
is
what
knocks
them
for
a
loop
do
usually
i
dont
mind
my
beers
on
the
boozy
side
but
this
was
a
bit
much
almost
harsh
would
have
again
down
the
line
but
will
be
wiser
to
split
with
someone
held
up
well
held
on
to
this
one
for
a
special
occasion
prepoker
night
will
do
overall
really
surprised
by
this
one
and
glad
to
have
tried
it
the
combo
of
fruit
and
roasted
malt
really
works
well
the
cpj
looks
pretty
good
thick
black
with
a
nice
dark

head
good
stops
there
really
now
there
is
a
great
stoutlike
beer
in
here
roasted
malts
nice
chocolate
and
coffee
in
the
taste
and
the
aroma
its
pleasant
but
you
have
to
cut
through
this
ridiculous
sweet
slightly
tart
pomegranate
taste
and
aroma
it
just
doesnt
work
with
the
stout
qualities
i
think
maybe
it
would
work
better
in
lower
doses
but
as
it
sits
its
too
overwhelming
and
disrupts
the
vibe
here
oddities
aside
the
feel
is
not
bad
medium
good
carbonation
overall
though
this
just
wasnt
very
appealing
o
flavorful
unique
interesting
but
ultimately
not
very
appealing
overall
the
beer
suffers
for
being
too
sweet
and
i
like
sweet
beer
it
may
have
been
better
fresh
in
2009
the
bottle
says
it
can
be
cellared
for
12
years
but
aged
as
it
was
the
sweetness
overwhelms
everything
else
o
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
beer
too
much
fake
like
sweetness
i
would
have
this
again
but
would
not
buy
it
myself
one
is
enough
for
a
sitting
and
half
the
bottle
would
have
been
better
drinkable
nope
im
not
sure
i
can
take
more
than
4
6
ounces
pours
bitch
black
with
almost
no
head
smells
a
bit
like
licorice
and
coffee
flavoring
very
thick
and
syrupy
tastes
like
a
watered
down
kahlua
not
really
much
going
on
here
there
is
no
pomegranate
at
all
overall
a
very
rich
and
thick
beer
that
is
not
that
fun
to
drink
the
booze
is
hidden
well
but
thats
not
too
important
not
really
worth
seeking
out
but
if
its
there
try
it
pours
a
purplish
brown
with
a
rather
fizzy
ecru
head
pomegranate
juice
and
cardboard
in
the
aroma
with
some
soy
sauce
sharp
acidic
fruit
juice
flavor
with
pomegranate
seeds
and
prunes
i
guess
theres
some
roasted
malt
imperial
stout
blah
blah
blah
in
there
too
really
weird
beer
dont
know
what
to
make
of
it
but
i
certainly
cant
rate
it
highly
by
any
standard
d
ill
admit
that
this
is
an
interesting
beer
and
probably
the
first
time
ive
tasted
fermented
pomegranate
but
its
probably
the
last
time
i
will
taste
it
in
this
beer
there
is
no
way
i
could
drink
a
second
one
of
these
and
finishing
this
first
one
may
be
a
little
difficult
d
defiantly
would
not
sit
down
and
drink
to
many
of
these
they
have
a
pretty
high
abv
but
also
a
very
sweet
flavor
a
really
cool
concept
but
nothing
i
will
keep
stocked
in
the
fridge
d
nice
and
a
good
change
of
pace
beer
i
certainly
couldnt
do
a
whole
night
of
them
though
thanks
again
dmangtr
drinkability
not
too
shabby
i
was
excited
to
try
this
one
and
after
the
nose
i
had
second
thoughts
but
it
really
is
pretty
tasty
and
one
way
or
another
everything
works
easy
to
drink
but
definitely
not
a
soft
drink
initial
strong
stout
flavors
but
then
followed
by
coke
nuances
had
it
on
draft
in
september
on
a
visit
home
but
did
not
pick
up
the
cola
flavors
then
unique
interesting
and
tasty
brew
pours
dark
brown
black
with
a
small
tan
head
aroma
of
coffee
dark
malts
and
some
cacao
taste
is
of
coffee
dark
roasted
malts
caramel
slight
hint
of
licorice
dark
fruits
light
bitter
hops
palate
is
full
bodied
creamy
and
oily
finish
is
smooth
and
creamy
can
taste
the
pomegranate
overall
this
is
a
nice
and
smooth
drinking
brew
very
enjoyable
drinkability
dessert
drink
d
this
beer
sounded
like
it
could
be
very
interesting
and
i
suppose
it
was
interesting
it
just
wasnt
exactly
my
thing
i
just
dont
think
the
roastiness
worked
all
that
well
with
a
fruit
like
pomegranate
because
of
the
perceived
lightness
of
the
body
of
this
beer
i
would
say
this
could
be
a
very
drinkable
stout
but
the
sweetness
overall
kind
of
kills
it
this
beer
has
good
potential
and
maybe
with
some
age
itd
be
better
maybe
2009
vintage
it
pours
a
surprisingly
opaque
black
the
pour
from
the
bottle
seemed
much
more
rubytinged
topped
by
nearly
a
finger
of
darkish
ecru
foam
the
nose
is
pretty
similar
to
an
infected
oatmeal
stout
with
some
black
cherries
hanging
all
damoclesianly
over
chocolate
graham
crackers
and
cinnamon
the
fruit
is
more
pronounced
than
in
an
infected
bottle
though
the
taste
starts
off
fairly
similarly
with
a
blast
of
chocolatecovered
cherries
pomegranate
juice
and
roasted
malts
but
the
fruits
seem
to
become
burnt
as
the
liquid
flows
to
the
back
of
the
tongue
eliciting
a
slight
cringe
and
grimace
the
body
is
a
loose
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
kinda
watery
feel
overall
this
is
definitely
a
strange
brew
no
rick
moranis
pun
intended
not
altogether
offensive
but
also
nothing
id
really
ask
for
again
not
really
my
bag
i
think
though
it
is
nice
to
see
granates
gettin
some
love
ill
give
them
credit
for
the
creativity
here
but
this
tastes
like
someone
took
a
schwartzbier
and
mixed
in
apple
and
grape
juice
i
wouldnt
bother
with
this
again
they
really
need
to
dial
back
on
the
fruit
juice
d
cant
say
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
but
there
is
something
very
unique
about
it
that
makes
it
feel
worthwhile
since
i
only
bought
a
single
bottle
while
we
appreciate
the
concept
of
going
down
the
road
of
extreme
mack
in
black
seems
to
miss
its
mark
with
throwing
balance
and
drinkability
totally
out
the
window

this

at

overall
a

the
pure

killer
and
almost
takes
over
the
whole
beer
i
wish
a
few
more
base
notes
came
through
but
this
is
still
a
delicious
beer
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
snifter
the
beer
is
an
unfiltered
muddled
light
brown
coloring
with
sparse
trails
of
carbonation
throughout
the
body
and
no

a
potent

while
this
is

its

i

i
like
the

a

more
but
this
is
a
fine
beer
without
a

slight
change

darn
fine
beeri
think
i
enjoy
this
less
as
it
warms
though
overall
really
nice
here
not
quite
as
well
balanced
and
interesting
as
the
base
beer
as
the
oak
aging
has
made
it
somewhat
onedimensional
but
this
is
still
a
delicious
treat
id
drink
this
one
again
for
sure
but
wouldnt
bother
seeking
it
out
thanks
again
doopie
o
its
amazing
how
much
a
barrel
can
change
and
integrate
itself
into
the

it
is

heavy

still
with

that
prickles
the
tongue
huge
complex
flavors
awesome
brew
and
i
was
surprised
how
much
oak
remained
on
this
after
4
years
o
this
beer
was
definitely
a
little
bit
different
then
i
thought
it
would
be
over
the
last
few
years
it
picked
up
a
musty
slightly
acidic
quality
to
it
it
didnt
completely
ruin
the
beer
more
of
just
added
an
interesting
presence
to
it
while
still
showcasing
the
wood
and
sweetness
nonetheless
i
think
i
would
prefer
this
fresh
and
in
my
taste
adam
is
definitely
a
better
beer
this
beer
was
interesting
to
try
but
i
definitely
wouldnt
trade
the
cellar
for
it
t
spicy
oak
right
hits
right
away
and
kind
of
lingers
over
the
palate
letting
other

join
it
without
ever
really
fading

light

try
this

a
hazy
honey

with
a
foamy
beige

that
settles
to
wisps

streaks

form
around
the
glass
on

down
smell

earth

taste
is
much
the
same
with
citrus
zest
honey
and
wood
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
woody
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
with
a
very
nice
wood
aged
presence
going
on
with
the
base
beer
wonderful
beer
very
very
fruity
with
very
little
carbonation
so
if
yo
really
like
the
carbonation
beware
very
fruity
smell
with
hings
of
cherry
and
roses
dark
brownish
color
with
a
caramely
look
to
it
tastes
of
caramel
cherry
and
smoked
wood
very
good
beer
a
definite
sipper
and
would
be
perfect
in
the
fall
in
my
opinion
overall
where
regular
fred
had
a
ton
of
everything
going
on
that
was
a
bit
too
much
and
didnt
quite
do
it
for
me
fred
from
the
wood
is
much
different
the
oak
aging
mellowed
it
out
some
and
the
oak
is
very
apparent
as
well
as
the
smokiness
the
caramel
is
a
nice
treat
at
the
end
recommended
omuch
better
than
the
bourbon
version
maybe
it
was
just
the
carbonation
but
this
had
great
balance
with
bourbon
was
a
border
line
bourbon
bomb
another
extremely
solid
brew
from
hair
of
the
dog
their
sleight
of
hand
with
these
old
ales
and
barley
wines
is
really
something
to
marvel
at
they
are
the
kings
of
the
slow
sippers
fred
from
the
wood
is
unique
in
its
capacity
of
oak
and
ability
to
still
drink
so
relatively
easy
for
the
heftiness
of
the
brew
id
like
to
get
my
hands
on
some
more
of
this
overall
with
this
beer
tonite
i
have
finally
tried
of
all
the
from
the
wood
series
beers
that
hotd
has
ever
bottled
this
is
another
hotd
gem
i
enjoy
fred
very
much
and
it
is
a
fantastic
base
beer
to
put
into
a
barrel
fred
from
the
wood
is
no
doubt
an
improvement
of
regular
fred
it
drinks
fantastic
fresh
and
will
age
gracefully
i
highly
recommend
it
i
think
that
this
is
almost
as
good
as
2012
bourbon
fred
from
the
woodthe
properly
carbonated
batch
i
think
this
beer
would
also
fit
into
the
style
category
of
an
oak
aged
old
ale
or
a
really
really
big
oak
aged
wee
heavy
based
on
the
look
smell
flavor
profile
and
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
o
what
else
to
expect
from
hotd
they
make
amazing
beers
the
oak
aging
has
been
done
with
tact
and
understanding
of
what
flavors
can
be
extracted
and
complimentary
to
the
existing
beer
i
would
to
have
an
older
vintage
but
this
certainly
drinks
well
fresh
may
actually
prefer
this
to
the
bourbon
variant
i
have
had
this
a
few
time
i
think
every
time
has
been
through
daja007
which
is
the
case
for
most
of
the
rare
stuff
that
i
get
to
try
always
a
great
experience
highly
recommended
to
say
the
least
d
surprisingly
enjoyable
stuff
quite
mellow
and
a
significant
improvement
on
the
base
beer
im
going
to
have
to
get
another
bottle
or
two
of
this
when
its
released
next
overall
i
deem
this
a
good
beer
but
not
for
everyone
at
first
i
thought
i
wasnt
going
to
like
this
beer
but
now
that
im
halfway
into
it
amf
its
started
to
warm
up
ive
changed
my
mind
not
for
the
weak
of
heart
or
unsofisticated
of
palate
but
a
good
brew
non
the
less
however
the
base
beer
is
nothing
special
overall
the
aging
has
made
this
a
fascinating
beer
very
complex
would
have
loved
to
have
tried
this
fresh
o
the
fresh
oak
flavors
have
held
up
remarkablely
well
and
i
like
the
added
depth
it
gave
to
the
flavor
profile
a
nice
treat
o
very
nice
oak
forward
beer
less
spice
and
more
honey
qualities
than
fred
and
it
loses
the
pinot
gris
character
tasty
stuff
though
not
quite
to
the
level
of
adammatt
prolly
due
to
the
base
in
any
case
well
balanced
and
the
barrel
treatment
enhances
the
base
beer
not
sure
whether
fred
is
just
not
my
bag
or
that
aging
has
done
this
beer
ill
or
both
as
is
this
is
just
a
messy
bottle
of
fruit
syrup
that
doesnt
stand
up
well
a
disappointment
o
overall
i
thought
this
was
an
awesome
beer
up
their
with
cherry
adam
from
the
wood
as
probably
my
favorite
hotd
beer
just
a
lot
of
wood
cherries
and
sweet
dark
fruits
would
love
to
get
more
of
this
one
o
this
reminds
me
in
certain
ways
to
an
older
stille
nacht
without
woodiness
regardless
the
bottle
i
had
was
great
extremely
interesting
probably
my
favorite
asa
ive
had
this
is
an
excellent
beer
much
worth
seeking
out
o
very
tasty
this
one
isnt
as
great
as
the
2007
but
well
worth
checking
out
still
requires
more
development
time
oddly
enough
whereas
the
2007
was
near
perfect
when
i
last
had
it
this
might
be
the
fault
of
keg
aging
and
not
bottle
aging
though
the
screams
of
drink
me
coming
from
the
bottle
proved
to
be
too
much
tonight
pours
a
clear
deep
ambercopper
color
with
a
huge
beige
head
that
persists
forever
and
leaves
lots
of
sticky
lace
on
the
way
down
smells
of
caramel
brown
sugar
alcohol
slight
bit
of
sherry
lightly
earthy
and
sweet
dark
fruity
taste
is
caramel
and
sugary
sweet
with
an
earthy
herbal
edge
and
a
distinct
bit
of
alcohol
presence
i
could
sip
on
this
thing
all
night
long
if
only
that
damn
bottle
wasnt
so
small
medium
to
thick
body
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
and
a
sweet
almost
syrupy
mouthfeel
wood
aged
but
i
get
very
of
that
in
the
aroma
or
flavor
its
a
damn
fine
barleywine
just
the
same
maybe
the
wood
was
subtle
and
has
faded
but
id
drink
the
shit
out
of
these
if
i
could
the
beer
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
full
of
oak
and
dark
fruit
with
a
little
bit
of
cherry
coming
through
the
flavor
is
a
lot
more
complex
i
get
some
oak
and
wood
notes
as
well
as
some
cherry
and
cinnamon
there
is
also
a
strong
yeast
character
as
well
as
some
caramel
malt
overall
the
oak
is
quite
strong
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
o
a
true
delight
i
am
glad
that
i
finally
got
to
try
this
one
on
tap
now
i
just
want
more
o
hotd
makes
beer
like
nobody
else
and
this
beer
is
a
great
example
a
little
sweeter
than
im
used
to
but
sill
outstanding
the
from
the
wood
series
bring
a
level
of
complexity
that
you
dont
find
in
too
many
beers
a
must
try
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
heavier
side
with
carbonation
being
low
overall
it
was
a
pretty
good
beer
but
it
started
to
feel
a
little
overly
sweet
and
juicy
the
more
i
got
into
it
the
oaked
orange
juice
flavor
was
tough
to
get
out
of
my
mind
after
i
noticed
it
i
did
like
that
it
had
some
unique
and
interesting
flavors
to
it
though
it
was
a
pretty
good
beer
overall
but
not
one
that
really
stood
out
to
me
compared
to
their
other
beers
a
very
different
beer
than
what
i
had
expected
if
only
for
the
strange
rotting
woodgrape
skin
flavor
that
is
prevalent
towards
the
middle
and
end
a
solid
brew
that
is
very
unique
for
the
style
md
its
actually
very
easy
to
drink
its
a
syrupy
mouthfeel
with
very
light
carbonation
its
smooth
all
the
way
through
the
mouth
and
goes
down
too
easy
this
is
a
medium
to
full
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
level
of
carbonation
it
is
a
bold
sipper
yet
has
been
tamed
with
the
barrel
aging
i
am
loving
what
the
barrel
did
to
this
brew
lett
not
fool
ourselves
that
10
abv
is
not
hiding
here
but
even
while
it
is
out
in
the
open
the
broad
display
of
character
makes
for
one
very
enjoyable
and
deeply
complex
brew
to
sit
and
savor
i
need
more
of
this
thank
you
again
joe
verdict
this
was
a
2009
vintage
and
it
was
pretty
darn
incredible
its
hard
to
find
but
the
2011
vintage
is
around
the
corner
highly
recommended
this
is
one
that
ive
wanted
to
sit
down
with
for
a
while
now
and
it
didnt
disappoint
its
amazing
how
the
burnt
sugars
from
the
barrel
aging
really
transform
this
into
something
much
darker
and
even
sweeter
than
it
originally
was
this
was
a
complete
joy
to
drink
i
savored
every
drop
o
this
was
a
really
interesting
beer
it
was
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
preference
but
i
found
it
very
enjoyable
nonetheless
it
took
a
long
time
for
me
to
make
the
effort
to
stop
at
hair
of
the
dog
brewery
it
wont
take
much
of
an
effort
to
go
back
for
a
second
visit
o
looking
back
on
my
old
fred
review
i
can
see
the
similarities
between
the
beers
this
is
definitely
just
as
good
as
the
original
the
beer
is
really
nice
very
good
light
on
the
palate
but
strong
throughout
a
great
little
beer
again
i
wish
i
had
a
fred
to
taste
side
by
side
but
this
lived
up
to
my
memory
of
fred
i
would
have
it
again
hopefully
someday
in
a
side
by
side
with
a
similar
vintage
bottle
of
fred
very
nice
beer
here
this
beer
pours
out
as
a
slightly
murky
golden
color
with
a
thin
white
head
the
smell
of
this
beer
is
powerful
its
got
a
lot
of
sweet
boozy
wooden
aromas
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
also
quite
sweet
its
loaded
with
some
caramel
flavors
honey
fresh
wood
and
malts
the
mouthfeel
was
thick
and
oily
with
a
little
carbonation
to
it
overall
i
really
enjoyed
sipping
on
this
beer
its
not
a
brew
to
drink
fast
overall
love
the
taste
especially
the
vanilla
and
oak
inafter
the
finish
and
the
way
it
sits
in
your
mouth
i
would
very
much
like
to
try
this
fresh
and
aged
on
tap
unfortunately
this
wasnt
available
when
i
was
there
midjuly
though
i
did
have
some
awesome
brews
on
tap
at
the
time
i
like
this
a
lot
and
have
to
recommend
it
had
this
one
on
draft
at
the
brewery
awesome
def
more
wood
aging
than
from
the
bottle
this
was
heavy
and
strong
most
def
a
sipper
great
hops
and
malt
with
very
heavy
wood
flavor
drink
this
one
like
a
port
and
enjoy
slow
i
would
def
recommend
the
thee
ounce
pour
pretty
sweet
good
thing
it
came
in
a
small
glass
but
the
booze
and
hops
keep
things
from
being
cloying
or
hysterically
overwrought
nice
if
skewed
barrel
characteristics
are
your
thing
d
deefreakinliscious
what
a
treat
to
have
this
vintage
2008
version
on
tap
this
really
mellowed
with
a
few
years
under
its
belt
the
alcohol
was
very
restrained
surprisingly
cherry
adam
from
the
wood
was
on
tap
just
before
but
it
kicked
right
before
i
got
there
this
however
was
a
more
than
suitable
replacement
half
finger
medium
tan
head
pretty
quick
dissipation
resulting
in
thin
ring
of
head
around
edge
of
glass
amber
brown
body
nearly
opaque
a
bit
cloudy
lazy
trails
of
tiny
carbonation
bubbles
rising
around
edge
of
glass
nose
is
complexthe
oak
barrel
is
prominent
but
picking
up
vanilla
dark
brown
sugar
the
normal
fred
hop
proflie
is
muted
by
the
barrel
aging
taste
mirrors
nose
very
deep
and
flavorful
taste
profile
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
hops
not
very
prominent
slight
bitterness
on
backend
mouthfeel
a
bit
on
the
full
side
of
medium
tres
sticky
this
is
undoubtedly
my
favorite
of
all
the
beers
alan
brews
and
to
have
this
aged
vintage
well
with
snaps
to
my
good
friend
and
stellar
ba
johnmichaelsen
must
have
vintage
fred
from
the
wood
absolutely
superb
overall
i
was
very
lucky
to
get
this
as
a
hand
out
and
will
be
seeking
more
it
was
not
exactly
what
i
ecspected
but
it
was
still
damn
delicious
overall
very
good
a
decisive
improvement
from
regular
fred
but
i
still
wish
wish
regular
fred
was
like
this
with
fftw
taking
it
to
another
level
of
complexity
solid
but
not
a
wow
barleywine
which
i
think
is
necessary
to
pay
that
much
for
a
12oz
bottle
medium
bodied
and
sweet
with
soft
carbonation
up
front
and
a
prominent
barrel
character
huge
blast
of
toasted
oak
up
front
with
boozy
sweetness
that
lingers
throughout
nicely
balanced
with
hints
of
light
fruit
vanilla
oak
and
booze
subtle
peppery
spice
adds
complexity
to
an
already
crazy
beer
slightly
creamy
and
fuller
bodied
than
expected
with
a
well
masked
abv
hints
of
apple
pear
and
apricot
provide
sweetness
that
adds
to
the
insane
drinkability
of
this
beast
definetly
more
enjoyable
less
intense
than
cherry
adam
in
my
opinion
o
this
is
a
really
good
beer
that
i
knew
almost
nothing
about
until
i
opened
it
intense
flavor
very
smooth
and
holding
up
well
after
3
years
i
wish
i
had
more
after
years
of
sitting
around
this
beer
only
matured
in
every
aspect
i
dont
give
perfect
scores
but
my
wife
and
i
both
thought
this
beer
sets
the
standard
michael
it
would
be
much
easier
to
decipher
between
all
of
these
barleywines
if
when
we
were
having
them
some
of
them
had
actually
sucked
that
was
never
the
case
this
offering
pours
a
deep
auburn
color
with
a
frothy
bit
of
offwhite
head
the
aromatics
are
rather
unique
im
not
sure
what
wood
fred
is
from
but
it
doesnt
smell
like
oak
it
smells
more
like
pine
to
me
some
of
the
aromas
and
flavors
because
at
this
point
they
were
getting
all
muddled
together
was
a
more
citrusy
pineapple
flavor
with
an
accent
of
mint
and
finished
off
by
some
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
it
was
rather
interesting
it
went
from
a
dipa
to
a
winter
warmer
just
in
letting
it
explore
my
palate
it
was
a
rather
pleasant
beer
to
consume
the
only
problem
being
it
was
still
with
2
years
on
it
a
little
on
the
boozy
side
i
would
almost
be
inclined
to
let
it
go
for
another
year
an
see
how
it
turns
out
2008
vintage
i
wanna
see
the
version
from
the
streets
fred
from
the
hood
flava
flav
would
play
the
lead
id
see
it
anyway
this
less
ghettofabulous
brew
pours
a
lightly
murky
amberrusset
topped
by
a
halffinger
of
lightly
dirty
sandstone
foam
the
nose
comprises
apricot
orange
zest
caramel
and
butterscotch
the
taste
does
not
choose
to
deviate
from
this
path
though
the
orange
peel
flavor
is
stronger
now
and
a
touch
of
the
alcohol
is
now
noticeable
the
body
is
a
straight
medium
with
a
very
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
syrupy
almost
chewy
feel
overall
a
very
nice
bwine
one
that
the
couple
years
seems
to
have
helped
though
not
having
had
it
fresh
i
dont
have
anything
to
compare
it
to
flourish
good
times
mouthfeeloverall
body
is
a
touch
thinner
than
the
original
fred
but
still
pretty
creamy
very
good
overall
i
like
this
about
the
same
as
the
original
fred
less
spiciness
from
the
rye
and
quite
a
bit
more
sweetness
but
in
the
end
things
pretty
much
even
out
overy
impressed
with
this
beer
and
not
what
i
was
expecting
for
10
2
years
put
away
feel
like
it
really
smoothed
this
guy
out
interested
to
try
it
fresh
but
dont
think
its
nearly
as
good
with
age
wish
i
held
out
longer
as
i
can
see
this
guy
only
getting
better
for
a
few
more
years

2008
12
oz
bottle
pours
a
glowing
orange
brown
behind
so
light
with
basically
no
head
left
the
last
ounce
or
so
in
the
bottle
for
the
yeast
to
hang
out
in
a
little
thrashing
of
a
straw
gets
a
bit
of
head
up
and
a
big
whiff
reveals
sugared
raisins
and
candy
almost
a
bit
of
citrus
as
well
smells
like
one
of
the
sweetest
beers
i
have
smelled
taste
is
very
sweet
and
has
a
bit
of
that
citrus
element
along
with
a
small
amount
of
faded
hops
kind
of
tastes
like
someone
dumped
12
oz
of
orange
soda
into
a
barleywine
not
that
i
am
complaining
there
is
just
a
twinge
of
that
oak
and
tobacco
flavor
that
the
bottle
eludes
to
less
so
than
i
would
expect
but
it
does
add
a
nice
contrast
to
the
sweetness
it
tastes
good
but
maybe
not
great
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumheavy
with
little
to
no
carbonation
a
bit
syrupy
in
the
finish
the
sweetness
would
completely
envelop
the
tongue
in
the
finish
if
there
werent
that
leatheryoakyfaded
hops
in
the
back
very
drinkable
for
everything
i
have
described
above
a
few
of
the
sips
have
been
more
like
glugs
which
is
pretty
surprising
for
a
barleywine
its
that
odd
interesting
awesome
12
oz
of
orange
soda
that
isnt
really
in
the
beer
but
i
swear
i
get
this
is
a
good
beer
that
wasnt
quite
as
good
as
i
was
expecting
could
have
been
a
touch
less
sweet
with
a
bit
more
oak
to
tone
it
down
a
bit
that
being
said
it
is
very
enjoyable
casting
aside
expectations
adam
set
the
bar
so
high
for
me
with
these
guys
everything
else
has
paled
in
comparison
lest
this
be
construed
as
anything
other
than
a
recomendation
ill
be
to
the
point
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
i
may
not
love
all
of
the
aspects
but
it
has
delicious
moments
and
perhaps
more
importantly
it
is
very
unique
and
a
useful
tool
of
exploration
into
american
oak
i
now
know
that
100
new
a
o
is
far
too
much
for
a
beer
to
my
taste
and
yet
strangely
ill
be
looking
forward
to
getting
more
of
this
on
the
next
release
bottle
poured
into
a
tasting
glass
a
slightly
murky
amber
orange
color
with
a
slight
tan
head
the
aroma
is
fairly
complex
and
stands
out
from
the
other
bws
i
had
this
night
the
barrel
is
front
and
center
and
is
very
noticeable
after
the
barrel
notes
other
flavors
make
their
way
in
the
nose
like
some
spice
dark
fruit
and
a
slight
vegetable
aroma
very
sweet
start
in
the
taste
of
raisan
andor
prune
barrel
and
minimal
hops
all
the
flavors
are
well
integrated
and
work
well
together
the
booze
is
eveident
but
not
overpowering
very
tasty
d
good
smooth
rich
flavorful
this
is
a
sure
sipper
but
i
could
easily
go
for
another
pour
d
still
very
tasty
and
im
glad
that
i
have
more
i
think
that
1
is
enough
for
the
night

this
has
the
makings
of
a
fantastic
beer
but
i
think
it
needs
a
good
three
years
to
get
to
that
level
even
though
this
bottle
had
over
a
year
on
it
the
taste
was
too
earthy
and
raw
i
love
oak
but
i
found
it
to
be
a
bit
too
aggressive
also
the
alcohol
is
way
too
apparent
right
now
its
quite
boozy
for
only
10
great
beer
just
not
yet
this
one
was
a
sipper
for
me
was
pretty
boozy
and
not
all
that
complex
perhaps
the
meal
i
had
with
it
wasnt
helping
it
out
any
but
if
i
had
a
bottle
of
this
id
let
it
sit
for
awhile
hopefully
will
be
able
to
get
another
bottle
of
this
one
day
overall
very
different
than
the
regular
fred
an
odd
flavor
that
i
couldnt
define
ever
had
a
sour
belgobarleywine
this
is
it
i
wish
i
could
have
it
uninfected
and
sadly
because
it
is
infected
i
have
to
dock
points
somewhere
and
i
will
go
with
the
smell
mediumheavy
body
sweet
and
burning
presence
very
nice
nightcap
beer
overall
an
enjoyable
experience
but
i
really
want
to
draw
attention
to
the
sour
smell
if
you
dont
enjoy
sours
the
smell
alone
might
turn
you
off
to
the
beer
before
you
even
try
it
never
have
i
had
a
beer
taste
so
radically
different
than
it
smelled
the
taste
mixes
the
oak
with
the
base
quite
well
bringing
out
a
bit
of
sweetness
and
fruit
mouthfeel
is
really
nice
and
rich
bringing
out
all
the
flavors
that
this
has
going
on
drinks
quite
well
and
is
a
really
nice
brew
d
i
liked
this
quite
a
bit
better
than
regular
fred
very
very
complex
and
enjoyable
overall
one
of
the
best
barleywines
ive
ever
had
so
balanced
and
so
tasty
highly
recommeneded
thanks
again
jeff
you
have
me
floored
holy
cow
major
major
thanks
to
hophead101
for
throwing
this
amazing
extra
in
the
box
ive
wanted
to
try
this
beer
like
crazy
for
a
while
and
cracking
it
open
blind
in
the
middle
of
the
box
was
such
a
sweet
surprise
i
think
it
held
up
to
what
i
was
expecting
in
quality
but
it
was
definitely
different
than
what
i
was
expecting
thanks
drinkability
i
want
another
now
the
one
was
all
i
had
because
of
the
8
oclock
closing
time
but
i
want
to
go
back
for
some
more
later
im
wondering
if
we
didnt
just
hit
the
hotd
lottery
i
have
not
had
previous
batches
so
i
cant
make
comparisons
but
this
batch
seems
perfect
some
reviews
call
this
to
hot
and
that
it
needs
more
time
in
the
bottle
i
disagree
and
must
say
that
for
a
young
alcohol
forward
beer
on
tap
mind
you
this
was
a
real
treat
to
enjoy
part
of
being
on
ba
for
me
is
to
find
new
interesting
beers
to
frequently
i
feel
let
down
after
anticipation
of
a
transcendent
beer
experience
falls
through
again
homerism
be
damned
today
i
can
honestly
say
i
found
my
new
favorite
beer
i
thoroughly
look
forward
to
something
that
will
top
this
one
day
find
this
obtain
it
and
drink
it
now
overall
a
little
hot
some
chunky
yeast
but
works
its
magic
over
the
palate
a
very
classy
and
smooth
brew
mdextremely
sweet
and
full
bodied
my
only
knock
on
the
beer
is
that
it
seems
too
sweet
but
it
is
delicious
nontheless
highly
recommended
beer
well
done
hotd
thin
cream
white
head
which
disappears
about
as
soon
as
it
arrives
you
also
get
a
razor
thin
stripe
of
lacing
in
a
few
spots
thick
brownorange
creek
mud
inside
the
clear
strong
effervescence
visible
brighter
zinc
orange
around
the
rims
big
dewy
nose
bursting
with
caramel
molasses
honey
vanilla
fudge
and
a
big
spoonful
of
orange
marmalade
ginger
and
cinnamon
spice
dates
and
maraschino
cherries
theres
something
like
a
bitter
rye
edge
more
than
grassiness
for
all
of
its
sweetness
has
excellent
posture
in
your
nostrils
fullbodied
sappy
clinginess
adds
to
the
weight
theres
tang
from
the
mandarin
orange
pink
grapefruit
citrus
but
overmatched
by
the
dark
chocolate
caramel
butterscotch
molasses
honey
and
pine
sap
a
sip
or
two
reminiscent
of
cherry
coke
well
layered
apricot
nectarine
guava
fig
date
and
golden
raisin
some
orange
pekoe
tea
leaf
notes
too
the
carbonation
isnt
light
per
se
but
fluffy
in
texture
and
not
changing
the
creaminess
ends
with
rising
bread
yeast
introducing
some
movement
vivid
flavors
would
be
better
if
it
dialed
it
back
a
notch
overall
i
enjoyed
fred
and
i
was
happy
to
see
that
fred
from
the
wood
didnt
disappoint
well
worth
a
shot
overall
amazing
aroma
but
very
malty
and
sweet
a
ton
of
flavor
and
i
really
enjoyed
all
the
fruit
flavors
fairly
drinkable
drinkability
despite
the
sourness
or
because
of
it
i
find
fred
from
the
wood
an
easy
drinking
strong
ale
but
i
have
to
say
i
prefer
the
regular
fred
by
a
country
mile
that
is
one
hell
of
a
good
brew
dark
cloudy
ruby
redorange
pour
into
my
ommegang
glass
almost
copper
in
color
head
is
off
tan
and
fairly
thick
but
doesnt
linger
very
long
aroma
is
of
thick
malts
and
dark
fruit
but
a
good
amount
of
citrus
as
well
slight
edge
of
alcohol
in
the
aroma
as
well
bitter
malt
and
biscuit
flavors
malt
is
definitely
contending
with
the
hops
on
this
one
i
think
there
is
a
fair
rye
component
to
this
beer
the
finish
has
a
nice
creamyness
similar
to
caramel
that
cleans
up
the
lingering
bitterness
on
the
mouthfeel
side
of
things
the
beer
has
a
sticky
syrupy
consistency
a
bit
on
the
thick
side
edit
i
am
consuming
a
2008
vintage
on
01172012
and
it
is
as
i
remembered
it
back
when
i
first
had
it
balanced
expression
of
wood
and
very
peachy
in
the
nose
and
mouth
i
find
this
version
far
superior
to
the
oak
juice
of
the
2009
vintage
d
an
excellent
sipper
great
barrel
character
and
a
wonderful
example
of
the
style
drinkability
is
superb
considering
fred
from
the
wood
is
such
a
massive
beer
with
so
many
intricacies
its
all
the
more
impressive
this
may
well
be
the
most
complex
beer
ive
yet
had
its
certainly
one
of
the
best
highly
recommended
aromas
of
leather
cookie
dough
smoky
malts
and
vanilla
extract
the
complex
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
full
bodied
with
light
pleasant
carbonation
packed
with
smoky
sweet
oak
flavor
as
well
as
caramel
citrus
fruits
banana
and
a
buttery
sweetness
light
piney
hops
show
up
on
the
back
palate
behind
a
wall
of
oak
a
world
class
barleywine
wish
they
made
more
of
it
d
after
this
beer
warms
it
really
comes
together
well
very
good
beer
that
i
had
been
wanting
to
try
thanks
again
beerwolf
overall
a
bit
of
a
step
up
from
regular
fred
a
real
nice
barley
wine
made
for
sipping
d
i
love
it
i
am
ready
to
leave
right
now
and
fly
out
to
the
brewery
whos
comen
with
me
but
a
lass
circumstances
wont
allow
for
it
i
guess
i
will
just
have
to
dream
about
it
and
hope
that
some
day
i
might
be
luckily
and
find
some
more
d
its
a
big
huge
brew
and
with
about
as
much
flavor
as
ive
ever
seen
its
well
worth
splitting
with
a
friend
12oz
would
do
a
number
on
ya
but
id
like
to
try
i
preferred
this
in
small
sips
but
i
just
wanted
to
drink
it
on
up
and
quickly
im
not
a
fan
of
overly
woody
beers
but
this
one
opened
my
eyes
like
no
other
its
just
so
tasty
im
buying
another
bottle
or
two
asap
and
im
drinking
them
up
quick
as
well
i
really
dont
see
the
point
in
aging
this
its
drinking
awesome
now
i
really
enjoyed
the
hop
circus
in
this
between
the
wood
citrus
hops
and
regular
fred
we
got
ourselves
a
winner
well
worth
the
cratch
admittedly
not
my
style
but
interesting
to
drink
reminds
me
of
drinking
a
strong
ale
in
the
90s
when
qc
wasnt
really
a
concern
youd
think
wow
thats
stronger
than
the
average
beer
but
it
wasnt
really
that
great
but
strong
enough
that
you
want
to
drink
it
this
beer
has
that
sort
of
appeal
d
more
than
a
barleywine
this
reminds
me
a
lot
more
of
de
dolles
stille
nacht
a
beer
that
i
praise
very
highly
d
its
a
sipper
but
a
very
well
crafted
beer
glad
i
have
another
to
lay
down
for
a
few
years
this
was
the
most
i
have
ever
paid
for
a
12oz
bottle
of
beer
it
was
very
good
but
there
are
too
many
other
brews
that
are
very
close
to
this
to
spend
this
kind
of
coin
ill
chalk
the
price
up
to
the
fact
that
the
waitress
shared
a
tidbit
there
were
only
4
cases
of
this
brew
sold
in
the
state
of
pa
in
2009
so
its
exclusive
its
also
a
sure
bet
that
this
beer
would
age
well
perhaps
making
the
price
a
little
more
justifiable
thanks
for
the
bottle
sam
a
very
tastey
brew
but
it
is
a
heavy
10
barleywine
youre
not
really
going
to
drink
that
many
of
them
in
one
night
but
it
is
not
a
fight
to
finish
it
either
d
a
truly
stellar
and
world
class
offering
not
enough
superlatives
to
express
the
greatness
of
this
hotd
offering
i
cant
see
how
age
could
help
this
one
any
its
near
perfection
as
is
this
beer
is
beautiful
like
the
inside
of
a
salmon
covered
by
the
thinnest
slices
of
oranges
in
fact
i
wish
thats
what
we
had
eaten
with
this
i
want
that
to
happen
the
barrel
is
all
over
this
beer
but
in
such
harmony
that
i
feel
almost
as
though
it
were
born
in
a
barrel
vanilla
and
oak
blending
so
righteously
with
that
beautiful
malt
profile
that
never
really
seems
as
high
abv
as
it
is
its
a
dancer
sweeping
the
hops
off
of
their
feet
and
leaping
high
into
the
sky
the
hop
profile
is
complex
orange
and
grapefruit
some
other
fruits
the
pine
hides
in
the
cracks
of
the
oak
so
smooth
thanks
alan
for
creating
such
a
well
designed
beverage
reading
some
reviews
it
seems
the
malt
comes
forward
given
a
bit
more
time
im
going
to
let
that
2009
bottle
sit
for
quite
a
few
years
and
see
what
happens
this
is
one
of
the
better
hotd
beers
ive
had
im
really
glad
i
have
another
one
i
can
hold
on
to
and
see
what
happens
pours
a
hazy
caramel
iced
tea
color
visibly
effervescent
with
a
full
finger
foamy
light
off
white
head
that
resists
fading
and
leaves
tons
of
sticky
belgian
lacing
behind
there
is
a
brightness
to
the
nose
thats
almost
citriusy
yet
very
malty
sweet
butterscotch
soy
sauce
and
bourbon
notes
full
flavored
buttery
spicy
almost
hot
and
sweet
a
salty
tangy
full
bodied
mouth
feel
is
both
a
wakeup
call
and
a
big
factor
in
the
lingering
characteristic
of
tobacco
over
light
bourbon
complex
and
worth
considering
id
let
the
next
one
sit
a
bit
though
a
little
pricey
at
12
for
the
12oz
bottle
but
well
worth
it
i
might
pick
up
another
to
cellar
for
a
year
or
more
d
one
and
done
too
special
to
be
drinkable
the
price
tag
on
this
beer
was
high
but
it
fits
the
experience
enjoy
it
while
at
home
with
nothing
stressing
you
exceptional
overall
simply
awesome
brew
will
only
get
better
w
age
definately
give
this
one
a
try
this
is
one
fine
beer
definitely
one
of
the
best
of
the
style
should
be
rated
much
higher
but
just
like
with
hair
of
the
dogs
other
beers
there
is
probably
so
much
variation
in
each
bottle
that
some
people
just
dont
get
to
taste
what
i
am
tasting
right
now
this
was
a
2007
bottle
of
fred
from
the
wood
the
colour
was
a
dark
orange
with
very
little
head
the
aroma
was
that
of
fresh
dundee
marmalade
the
palate
was
somewhat
funky
up
front
then
the
barrel
came
through
with
lots
of
oak
and
burnt
sugar
the
beer
was
slightly
cloying
but
not
overt
and
the
finish
was
quite
long
quite
nice
but
i
wonder
on
some
fronts
if
it
needs
more
cellar
time
the
barrel
aging
did
wonders
for
this
beer
my
new
favorite
from
mr
sprints
really
impressive
medium
body
syrupy
with
tannic
textures
near
the
finish
gentle
to
moderate
carbonation
gives
light
tingle
helps
with
smooth
almost
creamy
texture
hair
of
the
dog
has
done
it
once
again
fred
was
delicious
beer
and
fred
from
the
wood
is
as
well
six
months
of
oak
barrel
exposure
turned
great
beer
into
equally
great
beer
yeah
i
could
have
predicted
that
highly
recommended
drinkability
tasty
brew
and
one
im
glad
to
have
tried
the
smell
left
a
little
to
be
desired
and
truth
be
told
so
did
the
taste
this
one
was
a
little
high
a
little
fruity
a
little
estery
and
a
little
odd
as
good
as
the
original
fred
im
unsure
that
being
said
it
was
complex
fairly
enjoyable
on
the
whole
and
the
alcohol
was
incredibly
wellhidden
so
yes
ill
recommend
it
and
im
glad
to
have
had
the
opportunity
note
i
tried
this
bottle
again
to
give
it
a
second
chance
way
to
sweet
for
my
liking
and
still
reminding
me
too
much
or
steak
sauce
pours
a
murky
orange
color
that
radiates
in
the
glass
and
has
a
pillowing
two
fingers
of
head
that
is
slow
to
dissolve
the
aroma
is
sweet
citrus
peel
yeast
vanilla
and
caramel
the
flavor
has
sweet
malt
and
grapefruit
upfront
and
is
accompanied
by
toffee
vanilla
and
finishes
sweet
and
boozy
it
has
a
creamy
full
body
and
makes
it
a
nice
sipper
very
enjoyable
beer
highly
quaffable
and
deliciously
decadent
d
very
good
nice
complexity
would
make
me
want
to
stretch
a
glass
for
a
while
but
even
two
bottles
would
be
no
match
for
me
overall
really
looked
forward
to
this
one
but
probably
wont
be
seeking
it
out
again
sort
of
sucks
because
i
am
a
huge
barleywine
fine
but
this
is
just
doesnt
even
compare
to
the
better
ones
i
have
had
o
this
is
a
delicious
take
on
the
already
great
tasting
fred
if
the
price
wasnt
so
high
i
would
have
purchased
a
case
and
would
drink
daily
fantastic
beer
d
awesome
heather
was
in
heaven
with
this
beer
barleywines
are
her
favorite
and
she
found
much
to
love
here
where
was
the
alcohol
very
well
hidden
overall
i
wouldnt
recommend
this
brew
unless
youre
into
the
recent
us
wild
beer
craze
poured
into
a
snifter
had
a
small
head
that
dissolved
quickly
amber
in
color
smells
very
fruity
but
i
cant
place
my
finger
on
what
fruits
specifically
the
taste
is
really
different
it
has
a
definite
wood
taste
with
some
hints
of
hard
alcohol
feels
light
on
the
tongue
and
smaller
sips
seem
to
have
a
nice
bite
at
the
end
i
pretty
much
finished
the
whole
bottle
before
i
could
finish
this
review
hows
that
for
drinkability
drinkability
boozy
and
disjointed
fresh
d
i
really
liked
this
one
a
very
refined
and
sophisticated
character
yet
with
plenty
of
edginess
to
make
things
interesting
the
aromas
of
fresh
oak
barrels
in
this
one
are
amazing
my
what
a
wonderful
beer
im
a
sucker
for
well
done
oak
and
this
really
delivers
should
you
be
able
to
acquire
one
of
these
and
find
yourself
slightly
dissatisfied
try
h
o
t
d
s
adam
if
you
already
havent
a
nice
muddy
golden
orange
color
body
with
a
huge
foamy
off
white
head
that
lasts
for
ever
medium
carbonation
tuns
of
lacing
and
sheeting
aroma
if
lots
of
oak
sweet
malt
tobacco
and
apple
skins
favor
is
out
of
this

huge
caamel
malt
sweet
cherry
vanilla
honey
nuts
and
hint
of
alcohol
sticky
mouthfeel
but
the
carbonation
seems
to
clean
the
palate
between
sips
full
body
balenced
very
complex
and
everchanging
flavors
and
aromas
probably
the
best
beer
i
have
had
to
date
a
nice
take
on
an
american
barleywine
that
ages
well
i
have
tasted
this
beer
before
at
five
years
and
it
just
gets
better
i
have
another
bottle
laid
down
to
rest
for
a
long
long
time
huge
flavors
come
from
this
one
loads
of
pineapple
citrus
up
front
lead
to
a
huge
hoppiness
especially
as
it
warms
up
more
flavors
develop
fruit
stripe
gum
canned
peaches
almost
masking
a
slight
cardboard
note
before
finishing
with
a
nice
bitterness
alcohol
is
pretty
well
hidden
but
this
one
warms
you
up
very
nice
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
with
a
nice
medium
level
of
carbonation
i
drink
so
many
barleywines
millions
with
low
carbonation
ive
forgotten
how
pleasurable
a
medium
level
of
carbonation
is
with
this
style
thats
right
pleasurable
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
smooth
this
beer
is
great
now
but
some
age
will
take
the
heat
off
of
himher
and
heshe
will
become
epic
fred
is
a
gem
fred
from
the
wood
is
a
rockstar
this
beer
can
hold
its
own
with
some
of
the
best
barleywines
out
there
right
now
thanks
for
the
two
bottles
guys
and
the
addiction
that
they
led
to
d
nice
sipper
but
as
with
most
barleywines
finishes
very
dirty
feels
like
the
sweet
malts
almost
back
up
in
the
throat
however
this
is
one
of
the
most
refined
mild
barleywines
that
i
have
experienced
superb
d
not
really
digging
this
one
d
definitely
a
sipper
not
the
most
drinkable
but
tasty
and
would
work
as
a
good
night
cap
drinkability
is
pretty
good
an
fantastic
american
strong
ale
like
no
other
not
one
to
drink
quickly
but
one
i
would
order
on
a
regular
basis
if
it
was
available
around
town
like
some
of
the
other
hotds
are
hv
an
unexpected
gift
from
oscar
at
the
red
in
santa
cruz
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
creamy
tan
head
aroma
is
caramel
with
overripe
stone
fruits
flavor
is
pineapples
caramel
tannic
wood
dark
fruit
and
peppery
alcohol
nice
complexity
full
mouthfeel
with
good
carbonation
finish
is
dry
and
woody
drinkability
worth
10
for
a
12oz
bottle
not
sure
about
that
but
it
was
quite
a
different
experience
and
would
never
turn
a
bottle
down
cut
down
the
oak
a
bit
and
this
would
be
a
perfect
beer
possibly
d
this
is
the
best
brew
i
have
had
in
a
while
while
at
first
sip
i
thought
it
may
be
a
bit
too
sweet
for
my
taste
after
a
few
more
i
couldnt
get
enough
the
balance
in
this
beer
is
unreal
the
alcohol
level
is
just
right
not
overpowering
but
highly
apparent
and
justified
just
super
complex
and
tasty
need
to
get
another
bottle
of
this
soon
i
dont
really
like
this
one
the
flavors
dont
really
mesh
well
together
drinkability
is
suprisingly
high
the
beer
has
a
few
rough
edges
but
the
flavor
profile
is
spot
on
and
the
alcohol
presence
is
undetectible
except
for
the
warmth
in
my
chest
a
nice
beer
for
sure
im
a
huge
fan
of
fred
and
think
this
is
a
great
new
interpretation
but
at
12
for
a
12oz
bottle
the
pricing
is
a
bit
absurd
this
is
a
standout
beer
id
drink
this
all
day
long
if
i
could
what
a
masterpiece
overall
impression
ridiculously
good
beer
get
yourself
some
of
this
overall
a
must
try
cheers
d
could
drink
this
all
the
time
would
be
worth
the
shits
and
the
headaches
if
i
could
drink
this
every
night
this
one
pours
a
rich
golden
color
slightly
darker
than
regular
fred
with
an
offwhite
head
that
is
very
sticky
the
aroma
is
mostly
a
very
toasty
oak
vanilla
burnt
sugar
and
a
woody
smell
like
matches
flavor
is
very
similar
to
regular
fred
but
that
oak
sort
of
steps
all
over
everything
it
seems
sweeter
less
nuanced
but
the
finish
is
a
bit
drier
which
helps
drinkability
mouthfeel
is
thick
but
with
good
carbonation
and
not
sticky
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
very
thick
creamy
and
buttery
this
is
a
very
slow
sipper
perhaps
this
will
change
with
age
i
am
willing
to
give
it
another
shot
drinkability
goes
down
pretty
easy
considering
the
abv
and
complexity
if
this
came
in
bombers
i
could
see
myself
putting
one
down
by
myself
without
thinking
twice
this
is
a
great
beer
that
alan
is
either
a
mad
genius
or
he
keeps
getting
lucky
ill
assume
the
first
until
proven
otherwise
i
owe
inflatablechair
a
huge
thanks
for
including
this
extra
in
a
recent
trade
this
favor
will
surely
be
returned
drinkability
is
great
much
more
well
balanced
than
i
remember
and
with
a
better
balance
against
the
barrel
too
fred
shows
through
much
more
than
it
did
then
and
im
definitely
enjoying
it
to
a
larger
degree

body
this
was
batch

pretty
good
but
i
wouldnt
go
nuts
about
it
well
weird
this
is
a
ba
beer
ah
hmm
right
well
yeah
im
comparing
it
to
a
ba
old
numskull
so
maybe
maybe
yeah
still
i
dont
get
the
ba
or
however
they
impart
their
woodiness
bit
id
have
to
compare
it
to
a
fred
to
really
see
i
suppose
not
gonna
happen
tonight
anyway
what
the
heck
is
up
with
calling
this
an
american
bw
what
hop
bitterness
and
wow
is
it
ever
thick
and
sweet
well
in
a
merican
bw
there
should
be
the
bitterness
or
some
other
kind
of
hoppiness
to
balance
out
the
sweetness
if
its
there
mind
you
hey
it
has
carbonation
so
all
is
not
lost
sometimes
sometimes
i
check
out
other
reviews
while
im
going
over
a
beer
its
weird
i
wonder
if
were
talking
about
the
same
beer
pronounced
bitterness
where
what
strange
ah
well
thanks
to
inflatablechair
for
this
one
2008
vintage
served
in
a
snifter
poured
a
hazy
gold
with
a
finger
of
fine
bubbled
white
head
bottle
conditioned
fairly
carbonated
lots
of
oak
and
vanilla
in
the
aroma
with
a
little
alcohol
and
burnt
sugar
medium
to
full
bodied
with
a
bit
of
a
spritzy
mouthfeel
very
deep
complex
malt
flavors
big
wood
flavor
long
lingering
finish
of
oak
with
some
alcohol
the
oak
really
worked
for
me
i
would
put
this
in
my
top
5
for
2008
a
friend
got
this
from
this
years
dock
sale
it
poured
very
cloudy
redbrown
color
with
virtually
no
head
smelled
very
strong
of
alcohol
with
a
hint
of
tobacco
in
there
it
had
a
nice
fruity
taste
to
it
but
the
alcohol
was
there
big
time
im
not
that
big
into
barleywines
but
this
one
is
drinkable
imo
thick
coating
sticky
mouthfeel
delicious
update

had
this
again
and
was
simply
blown
away
i
dont
think
there
was
anything
different
about
the
bottles
but
the
flavors
just
seemed
to
blend
so
well
to
me
tons
of
piney
wood
and
nice
sourlight
fruity
notes
i
could
really
taste
the
regular
fred
in
this
heavy
palate
but
smooth
this
was
incredibly
awesome
to
me
the
second
time
around
so
ive
got
to
change
my
numbers

the
palate
is
a
blend
of
orange
and
grapefruit
hop
juicevery
very
strange
with
no
real
bitterness
which
makes
this
seem
almost
honeylike
oxidation
is
starting
to
kick
in
adding
some
sherry
notes
which
complement
the
vanilla
from
the
oak
and
the
tannins
the
malt
bill
here
is
complex
its
been
too
long
since
ive
had
a
fred
with
a
blend
of
orange
blossom
honey
toffee
fruitcake
butterscotch
and
a
little
maple
there
isnt
too
much
brown
sugar
here
and
that
keeps
this
beer
well
in
enjoyable
territory
the
oak
character
has
fallen
off
by
quite
a
bit
if
my
memory
serves
me
right
the
tannins
have
been
integrated
into
the
flavor
profile
tempering
that
big
oak
notes
that
this
beer
had
and
this
also
enhances
drinkability
here
sweet
on
the
finish
with
a
blend
of
honey
maple
and
butterscotch
the
finish
is
also
where
the
oak
does
linger
with
a
blend
of
tannins
vanilla
and
very
lightly
if
that
toasted
oak
flavor
initially
highly
carbonated
in
quite
an
enjoyable
way
once
it
falls
off
this
comes
into
its
own
really
awesome
and
enjoyable
highly
recommended

ive
wanted
to
try
this
for
some
time
pours
a
cloudy
ruby
color
with
a
very
thick
pillow
head
the
thick
head
stays
throughout
adding
a
nice
creamy
texture
to
the
mouthfeel
the
aroma
is
full
of
sweet
candies
dark
fruit
brown
sugar
very
sweet
nose
balanced
by
strong
oak
notes
the
flavor
is
very
nice
initially
i
am
struck
by
the
agressive
amount
of
bitter
hops
the
oak
and
wood
flavors
come
in
soon
followed
by
a
ton
of
sweet
candied
fruits
some
rich
prune
plum
and
strawberry
flavors
the
flavor
is
well
rounded
by
the
barrel
almost
a
bit
of
bourbon
in
there
some
spices
especially
orange
peel
also
very
good
example
of
the
style
hotd
is
obviously
a
gem
and
produces
well
crafted
brews
i
loved
the
creamy
mouthfeel
and
the
aging
added
much
maybe
i
should
have
waited
to
drink
this
but
hey
it
was
great
id
love
to
get
my
hands
on
some
more
a
stark
reminder
for
my
passion
for
these
barreled
brews
notes
whoops
i
opened
this
thinking
it
was
regular
fred
and
one
whiff
had
me
figuring
otherwise
overall
a
very
nice
and
impressive
creation
from
hotd
and
the
black
cualdron
vat
kettle
of
doom
a
very
well
crafted
beer
one
that
is
defenitely
made
for
a
cold
cold
night
with
snow
and
wind
and
a
fire
in

sweet

this
one
is
a
sure
sipper
another
hit
from

recommended
good

fred
from

a
hell
of
an
impressive
beer
its
very
big
and
chock
full
of
flavor
its
got
a
lot
of
depth
and
character
i
really
like
the
oak
or
wood
flavor
of
this
beer
it
adds
a
lot
truly
a
gem
highly
recommended
if
you
can
find
a
bottle
d
this
is
a
very
interesting
brew
and
one
that
im
enjoying
slowly
im
very
interested
to
see
what
one
of
these
tastes
like
in
a
couple
years
as
its
probably
a
little
too
oaky
for
my
liking
right
now
dark
rich
oak
and
boozy
flavors
rich
with
intense
length
not
the
easiest
brew
to
drink
12oz

toronado
sd
much
better
from

than
the

not
sure
what
batch
drinking
well
and
this
brew
could
age
for
a
really
long
time
interested
in
trying
a
few
years
down
the
road
to
see
if
the

settles

drinkability
excellent
a

barleywine
crammed
to
the
absolute
brim
with
flavor
and
complexities
plus
they
dont
skimp
on
the
alcohol
notes
2008
batch
slightly
too
sweet
and
hot
to
session
i
think
with
some
age
on
this
one
it
will
be
better
d
as
with
regular
fred
i
wouldnt
call
this
a
barleywine
it
seems
that
i
might
not
like
beers
aged
in
new
oak
barrels
as
much
as
beers
aged
in
bourbon
or
whiskey
barrels
this
was
worth
trying
but
i
wont
have
another
d
drinkability
is
good
the
alcohol
is
not
hidden
at
all
but
the
addition
of
oak
brings
it
under
control
so
drinkability
is
not
hindered
this
amount
of
alcohol
makes
this
one
a
sipper
and
puts
the
limit
at
one
bottle
even
though
a
bottle
can
take
an
hour
or
two
to
finish
each
sip
is
inviting
and
keeps
you
coming
back
for
more
the
beer
is
smooth
and
creamy
and
goes
down
easy
i
would
happily
spend
another
evening
with
a
bottle
of
fred
from
the
wood
recommended
this
is
a
must
seek
out
brew
this
beer
is
not
one
of
my
favorites
it
might
could
benefit
from
age
i
will
not
seek
this
beer
out
again
d
this
beer
is
oustanding
right
now
but
its
amazing
to
think
what
a
year
of
aging
would
do
to
this
brew
its
still
showing
some
signs
of
youngness
but
also
signs
of
greatness
who
knows
what
the
future
will
bring
but
its
great
right
now
it
was
nicely
carbonated
for
such
a
heavy
beer
dangerously
drinkable
the
smell
is
kind
of
on
the
bad
side
of
the
barrel
aging
spectrumodd
barrel
aged
smells
i
relate
to
fish
food
but
this
is
really
nice
and
the
mouthfeel
is
outstanding
i
think
i
prefer
this
version
id
still
go
for
adam
or
doggie
claws
though
d
i
bought
a
sixer
of
this
to
trade
but
theres
no
way
im
letting
this
one
go
the
huge
oak
flavor
introduces
so
much
complexity
to
this
brew
that
its
hard
to
savor
i
simply
can
not
put
this
down
while
the
oak
is
almost
too
prominent
now
it
seems
likely
that
this
will
develop
into
an
even
better
beer

again
thanks
toby
d
for
a
big
oak
aged
brew
this
one
is
incredibly
easy
to
drink
i
cant
wait
to
see
how
this
one
holds
up
over
time
wowza
what
a
great
beer
the
residuals
get
a
bit
tiring
but
this
ones
tasting
super
fresh
as
with
the
regular
fred
i
believe
the
fresher
the
better
aging
may
dry
it
up
a
bit
but
youll
be
missing
out
on
the
oak
and
fresh

poured

formed

the
cloudy
reddish
amber
brew
head
is
down
to
an
uneven
layer
of
small
bubbles
in
a
flash
with
littletono
lacing
aroma
is
heavy
on
the
sweet
malt
with
ample
booziness
taste
is
the
same
sweet
grains
upfront
melting
into
the
alcohol
which
has
its
way
eased
by
the
oak
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
for
the
style
and
abv
drinkability
is
very
good
only
real
inkling
of
high
abv
is
numb
lips
long
after
the
swallow
worth
the
trouble
to
find
drinkability
this
brew
is
a
lot
like
bourbon
barrel
angels
share
to
me
its
absolutely
wonderful
and
ridiculously
tasty
but
i
dont
think
i
could
drink
more
than
one
the
oak
is
my
favorite
part
but
its
just
a
bit
much
after
awhile
really
tasty
brew
though
that
you
should
get
your
hands
on
if
possible
big
thanks
to
sam
dwow
this
is
some
tasty
stuff
i
think
i
have
wood
best
enjoyed
slowly
by
a
fire
with
a
big
fat
stogie
thanks
to
pelican
for
this
beer
pours
amber
with
a
thin
head
and
some
spotty
lacing
smells
massively
of
new
oak
and
piney
hops
with
some
sweet
fruit
and
malt
in
the
background
the
taste
is
huge
and
laden
with
oak
tannins
and
big
hop
bitterness
as
well
as
some
sweeet
honeyed
malt
this
is
an
oak
bomb
but
the
hops
are
so
prevalant
that
there
is
some
sort
of
balance
being
struck
here
this
beer
will
probably
improve
a
great
deal
after
a
year
or
two
of
aging
and
ive
got
another
laid
down
for
that
purpose
this
one
is
probably
six
months
old
and
i
wanted
to
taste
the
hops
while
they
were
relatively
fresh
after
some
time
the
flavors
should
mellow
and
integrate
more
still
as
big
as
it
is
im
enjoying
it
now
mouthfeel
is
rich
and
very
tannic
and
although
im
splitting
this
12
oz
bottle
threee
ways
that
is
enought
for
me
for
now
pours
a
dark
golden
brown
in
color
only
a
slight
froth
appears
on
the
pour
first
thing
i
notice
is
the
amount
of
hops
that
are
present
in
both
the
nose
and
taste
some
nice
oak
is
present
in
the
taste
that
helps
round
out
the
flavor
and
subdue
the
hop
presence
good
brew
i
dont
get
near
enough
hair
of
the
dog
stuff
d
the
epitomy
of
drinkable
wood
aged
beer
imo
just
fantastic
how
the
blend
of
malt
and
wood
flavors
have
a
nice
interplay
and
the
booziness
seems
controlled
in
relation
to
the
overall
drinkability
factor
body
is
mediumheavy
and
oily
lowmedium
co2
very
drinkable
and
really
enjoyable
especially
at
warmer
temps
heard
great
things
about
this
beer
and
had
to
try
it
for
myself
liked
nonbarrel
aged
fred
and
this
was
even
better
would
love
to
have
again
in
the
future
wonder
how
much
hotter
this
tasted
fresh
another
great
beer
from
the
pacific
northwest
one
of
the
more
mellow
ba
barleywines
i
have
had
highly
recommended
drinkability
is
good
this
is
a
very
different
tasting
beer
than
regular
fred
the
oak
is
very
potent
but
adds
a
really
interesting
taste
to
this
one
ill
be
enjoying
this
bottle
quite
a
bit
now
i
just
need
to
track
another
one
down
that
i
can
set
aside
for
a
year
or
so
d
pretty
tasty
but
maybe
not
quite
ready
for
much
more
than
slow
contemplative
sipping
within
a
year
this
may
be
transcendent
but
currently
its
a
little
hot
and
too
woody
for
my
lovin
a
lovely
beer
now
will
only
get
better
cheers
and
big
thanks
to
alan
at
hotd
for
crafting
this
winner
big
thanks
to
vwcraig
for
sending
this
2007
my
way
as
part
of
a
recent
trade
i
have
had
fred
and
liked
it
a
lot
so
i
am
anticipating
fftw
this
beer
was
a
tad
darker
than
fred
but
still
sorta
golden
until
the
last
dregs
went
in
which
turned
it
a
ruby
cloudy
color
the
smell
is
like
whiskey
or
bourbon
strong
alcohol
wow
i
dont
drink
whiskey
or
bourbon
but
i
love
the
smell
of
this
beer
surely
this
was
not
aged
in
plain
oak
barrels
if
it
was
huzzah
wow
the
taste
is
woody
woody
and
also
slightly
bitter
hoppiness
at
the
end
this
does
not
taste
like
the
fred
i
had
last
year
at
all
this
is
very
good
but
is
a
slow
sipper
due
to
the
strength
of
the
flavor
im
sure
this
stuff
is
also
pretty
potent
as
far
as
abv
goes
very
nice
beer
but
i
should
have
shared
it
with
a
friend
edit
as
of
1108
got
exactly
what
i
expected
from
the
above
nicely
sweet
with
woody
overtones
none
of
the
bitterness
of
the
first
brew
ok
so
i
have
yet
another
hotd
to
try
here
this
one
being
a
special
release
edition
i
am
a
big
fan
of
wood
aged
beers
so
this
one
should
be
a
real
treat
this
poured
a
very
nice
and
hazy
light
brown
with
a
large
two
inch
plus
head
of
foamy
tan
on
top
that
only
gradually
decided
to
fade
and
nestled
down
into
a
layer
of
lace
covering
the
top
and
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
aroma
was
very
interesting
it
had
a
definite
wine
like
character
and
the
wood
smell
was
defiantly
a
presence
had
a
bit
of
a
spiced
note
to
it
as
well
and
also
a
bit
of
alcohol
the
taste
was
very
strong
with
a
lot
of
alcohol
present
in
it
there
was
a
very
big
presence
of
spice
and
oak
barrel
taste
to
it
as
well
a
dry
hop
like
finish
tried
to
make
itself
known
at
the
end
but
never
really
got
that
far
past
the
strong
notes
from
the
other
flavors
very
nice
medium
to
full
body
gave
it
a
very
sipper
like
quality
overall
this
was
pretty
good
although
i
will
admit
not
my
favorite
offering
from
them
this
seemed
like
it
needed
to
sit
for
a
while
and
come
back
to
it
later
just
a
little
to
young
and
the
alcohol
just
a
little
too
strong
still
but
a
quality
selection
and
something
i
would
not
hesitate
to
pick
up
again
well
i
tried
this
batch
around
a
year
ago
and
thought
it
was
way
to
young
and
green
now
its
beginning
to
taste
unbelievable
the
oak
has
really
taken
a
turn
for
the
better
and
is
balancing
nicely
with
the
toffee
malty
buttered
biscuit
flavors
a
thick
earthy
tobacco
flavor
shows
through
on
the
mid
palate
and
finishes
with
a
full
palate
of
vanilla
hop
bitterness
hints
of
maple
a
floral
grassy
almost
herbal
note
on
the
finish
shows
good
rs
for
balance
man
the
new
american
oak
lends
such
a
pleasing
flavor
to
this
beer
and
has
a
mellow
silky
thick
mouthfeel
with
a
bit
of
a
spritzy
burst
on
the
finish
finish
is
long
and
decadent
this
is
a
beer
i
could
easily
drink
all
day
regardless
of
alcohol
which
by
the
way
is
hidden
completely
sweet
raisiny
date
flavors
with
a
ripe
fig
finish
again
grilled
fruits
which
lend
toward
pineapple
layers
just
keep
going
and
going
like
pink
bunny
addendum
as
i
drank
the
beer
the
tannins
and
oakiness
began
to
subside
or
rather
i
got
adjusted
to
it
it
became
quite
delectable
i
was
sad
to
see
the
last
drop
go
damn
good
stuff
tons
of
complexity
going
on
in
here
starts
off
with
an
intensly
sweet
musty
woody
earthy
aroma
that
soon
settled
into
deep
dark
dehydrated
fruit
scents
appearance
is
heartily
viscous
with
some
letting
and
with
a
thin
foamstand
that
held
firm
a
rich
chesnut
color
with
a
mild
haze
flavors
pick
up
on
a
medium
molassas
sweetness
with
dates
figs
plumbs
raisins
prunes
a
big
hop
balance
brings
citrus
frutis
grapefruits
and
oranges
tropical
fruits
pineapples
and
mangos
along
with
an
earthy
pine
and
lemongrass
flavor
the
wood
aging
also
brings
out
an
earthy
peaty
musty
flavor
with
some
nuttiness
and
vineousness
the
texture
is
full
bodied
but
smoothened
out
by
the
wood
aging
not
quite
chewey
but
close
finishes
sweet
and
dry
partly
from
alcohol
partly
from
hops
with
a
linger
focusing
on
the
sweetness
fantastic
beer
thanks
clvand0
just
a
great
beer
i
think
if
i
let
it
sit
for
about
2
years
it
will
be
fantastic
everything
will
blend
together
that
much
more
and
the
pronounced
hops
will
die
down
a
bit
and
just
make
it
smoother
good
but
really
not
as
good
as
a
plain
fresh
fred
mouthfeel
is
viscous
with
a
chewy
body
and
good
sturdy
carbonation
to
support
it
all
not
overly
heavy
or
syrupy
at
all
this
is
right
on
and
drinks
like
a
treat
overall
the
wood
aging
really
adds
a
wonderful
twist
to
fred
and
i
only
wish
i
had
more
than
one
bottle
a
truly
awesome
brew
thats
worth
seeking
out
i
hope
to
have
the
chance
to
try
this
and
adam
from
the
wood
again
sometime
the
mouthfeel
is
purely
amazing
rich
velvety
and
smooth
yet
still
wellcarbonated
just
perfect
this
beer
is
definitely
a
slow
sipper
but
perfection
is
meant
to
be
savored
take
your
time
and
enjoy
bottle
courtesy
of
hogtownharry
poured
a
medium
yellow
color
ale
with
a
small
foamy
white
head
with
minimal
retention
and
lacing
aroma
of
oak
and
sugar
is
totally
dominated
by
hot
alcohol
taste
is
totally
dominated
by
hot
burning
alcohol
which
is
not
something
that
i
am
usually
fond
of
some
oak
and
sweet
malt
were
discernable
but
still
totally
overshadowed
by
the
alcohol
i
honestly
could
hardly
taste
the
original
fred
in
here
and
i
sure
could
not
tell
if
there
were
any
hops
in
there
im
glad
i
got
the
chance
to
try
that
one
but
it
sure
is
not
something
i
will
seek
again
great
agedoaked
version
of
fred
by
hotd
i
would
love
to
try
bottles
of
fftw
and
fred
sidebyside
to
really
appreciate
what
aging
has
done
to
this
brew
i
was
just
let
down
by
the
aroma
well
worth
seeking
out
edit
from
122912
so
am
drinkng
the
last
bottle
of
the
case
of
the
2008
i
purchased
at
the
old
warehouse
location
in
spring
2008
its
truly
amazing
how
well
this
beer
ages
carbonation
is
still
pretty
decent
at
least
for
a
beer
more
than
4
years
old
on
both
the
nose
and
palate
this
beer
has
mellowed
into
a
thing
of
beauty
theres
chocolate
malt
balls
caramel
and
butter
scotch
on
the
nose
with
a
hint
of
underlying
skunkiness
that
only
adds
to
the
experience
the
beer
is
fairly
sweet
on
the
palate
with
butterscotch
vanilla
caramel
gingerbread
molasses
and
still
some
underlying
hoppy
bitterness
the
sweetness
comes
on
a
bit
strong
which
is
really
the
only
problem
i
have
with
this
beer
now
but
its
still
absolutely
delicious
alcohol
is
a
bit
more
noticeable
in
this
beer
then
it
was
3
or
4
years
ago
but
this
still
doesnt
come
across
as
a
10
abv
beer
excellent
and
an
absolute
testiment
to
the
ability
of
brewer
alan
sprints
wish
i
had
more
but
its
probably
just
as
well
to
drink
this
up
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
sweet
lightly
bitter
along
with
a
mild
booziness
pretty
nice
thanks
msubulldog25
for
the
opportunity
and
to
c64person
for
the
chance
to
revisit
the
2013
version
superdelicious
but
its
so
unusual
that
i
probably
wouldnt
recommend
it
as
any
everyday
type
thing
and
heck
its
retired
anyway
also
seems
like
it
would
do
well
laying
in
the
cellar
for
a
few
years
but
as
is
this
was
a
real
treat
split
with
dirtylou
while
in
madison
drinkability
enjoyable
again
an
excellent
beer
from
alan
sprints
at
hair
of
the
dog
not
sure
if
its
retiredi
just
bought
a
bottle
that
says
batch
64
but
dont
remember
how
often
its
made
from
talking
to
alan
during
our
tour
but
this
bottle
was
great
with
a
white
head
that
foamed
up
and
dropped
light
dirty
brown
color
hazy
tons
of
alcohol
in
the
nose
plus
the
wood
is
dominatingrasins
dark
fruity
esters
complex
very
cool
taste
follows
exactly
what
you
smellawesome
i
can
see
where
some
who
dont
love
barleywine
as
i
do
as
well
as
wood
could
see
it
as
out
of
balance
and
overpowering
to
which
i
say
drink
a
different
beer
and
leave
this
one
to
those
who
love
it
such
insane
balance
the
fruits
are
so
full
of
character
and
distinguishable
the
sweetness
is
not
cloying
only
pleasurable
and
the
hop
work
out
of
this
world
i
was
much
more
taken
with
this
then
i
was
with
the
regular
fred
the
yeast
and
bread
fade
in
this
example
and
the
fruit
malt
and
alcohol
tones
really
shine
amazing
it
really
grows
on
me
and
im
impressed
with
the
quality
of
the
carbonation
for
a
barrel
aged
beer
i
much
rather
like
fresh
oak
as
an
aging
implement
that
bourbon
barrels
12
oz
bottle
10
abv
batch
64
upon
opening
and
pouring
there
seemed
to
be
a
great
amount
of
carbonation
the
appearance
was
a
hazy
copperorange
color
and
there
was
a
huge
frothy
white
head
the
head
retention
on
this
was
outstanding
particularly
when
considering
the
size
of
this
beast
nice
sticky
patches
of
lace
were
left
when
the
head
finally
did
decide
to
disappear
big
woody
aroma
coconut
and
alcohol
maybe
a
bit
of
citrus
as
well
but
mostly
wood
sweetness
up
front
a
rich
and
robust
caramel
flavor
very
woody
and
warming
a
hint
of
ripe
fruit
and
some
citrusy
hop
flavor
with
a
fair
amount
of
bitterness
the
flavors
are
dominated
by
wood
and
the
beer
finishes
very
dry
medium
body
this
dog
needs
to
sit
for
a
while
a
long
while
the
woody
character
was
a
bit
much
for
me
but
may
be
enjoyed
by
others
who
love
barrelaged
beers
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
teeters
on
the
drinking
side
but
should
remain
on
the
sipping
side
i
would
love
to
get
my
hands
on
more
of
these
at
some
point
i
have
2
other
hotd
to
go
through
very
excited
probably
not
something
ill
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
in
a
trade
or
something
i
could
drink
it
again
if
some
one
was
offering
but
leave
it
at
that
12
ounce
bottle
purchased
from
liquid
solutions
batch
64
drinkability
both
of
these
beers
have
very
complex
characteristics
and
should
be
consumed
slowly
also
the
10
abv
is
felt
pretty
quickly
a
beer
that
demands
to
be
aged
for
sure
i
look
forward
to
cracking
another
open
in
a
few
years
hazy
mahogany
with
thin
film
of
foam
that
stays
throughout
aroma
of
resiny
hops
faint
caramel
malt
rainwater
and
aspirin
light
citrus
flavor
to
the
hops
orangegrapefruit
mainly
medicinal
tangy
spice
toward
finish
with
hint
of
oak
hops
dominate
this
one
for
the
most
part
mouthfeel
has
a
keen
smoothness
medium
thickness
with
lighter
carbonation
alcohol
is
strong
but
doable
drinkability
is
not
bad
it
would
be
hard
to
have
more
than
one
and
although
its
interesting
i
would
have
expected
more
from
an
barrel
aged
release
pours
copper
to
peach
in
color
murky
with
a
miniml
cream
head
that
fades
to
just
a
ring
quickly
initial
smell
shows
a
strong
oak
woody
characteristic
other
aromas
are
a
light
fruity
sweetness
that
is
blended
with
a
tannicwiney
alcohol
aroma
taste
displays
a
tawney
port
like
richness
but
with
a
lighter
lemony
sweettartness
there
is
a
nice
sweet
peach
fruit
flavor
the
oaky
flavor
is
strong
initially
but
my
palate
numbs
to
it
as
i
get
into
it
farther
and
the
fruit
flavors
come
out
more
the
beer
is
medium
in
body
with
a
nice
drying
finish
that
also
shows
a
little
alcohol
a
very
interesting
and
complex
beer
i
really
enjoyed
the
characteristics
that
the
raw
previously
unused
barrels
provided
batch
64
pours
a
hazy
amber
color
with
a
faint
off

be

this
poured
a

with
a
short
cap
of
fine
beige
bubbles
spotty
lacing
at
the
start
and
it
showed
decent
retention
oaky
aroma
with
a
nice
combination
of
vanilla
and
citrus
sweet
orange
and
caramel
the
flavour
started
off
with
sweet
caramel
followed
by
strong
woody
vanilla
and
a
solid
bitter
bite
citrusy
tangerine
hops
appear
towards
the
end
and
it
finishes
with
a
slightly
aggressive
alcohol
flavour
and
warmth
bitterness
lingers
low
carbonation
a
bit
heavy
with
a
nearly
syrupy
texture
i
found
the
flavours
to
be
very
distinct
with
a
separation
between
where
each
element
finished
and
the
next
began
i
also
found
it
just
slightly
harsh
in
the
alcohol
department
but
it
did
mellow
nicely
as
it
warmed
and
more
citrus
was
apparent
overall
an
interesting
beer
that
i
did
end
up
enjoying
thanks
for
sharing
grub
cheers
the
oak
probably
gets
in
the
way
of
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
but
it
adds
a
whole
other
layer
of
complexity
to
this
brew
that
almost
offsets
the
loss
in
drinkability
i
really
like
that
the
hop
notes
are
still
quite
pungent
in
this
brew
while
it
does
not
compare
to
a
fresh
fred
it
again
adds
lots
of
much
needed
complexity
to
offset
the
perhaps
dominant
oak
character
as
the
beer
warms
the
flavor
gains
even
more
balance
that
fresh
fred
hop
character
steps
up
a
bit
and
helps
to
balance
out
the
oak
notes
even
more
while
this
beer
has
always
been
quite
good
during
this
journey
through
my
12oz
bottle
this
beer
is
only
getting
better
as
it
warms
up
and
as
it
slowly
disappears
from
my
glass
this
beer
pours
a
murky
light
brown
color
with
a
small
head
that
falls
fast
and
leaves
a
little
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
has
a
bit
of
caramel
malt
with
a
sweetness
and
large
essence
of
wood
and
alcohol
the
flavor
starts
out
with
a
caramel
malt
sweetness
but
is
quickly
followed
by
intense
barrel
flavors
vanilla
and
wood
and
an
almost
bourbon
character
there
are
some
hops
that
show
themselves
in
the
flavor
but
the
wood
character
is
the
main
show
the
body
is
thick
enough
and
the
drinkability
is
pretty
good
one
of
the
best
ive
had
from
hotd
this
beer
was
by
far
the
best
selection
at
this
years
fesitval
i
would
definitely
order
this
one
again
and
would
suggest
a
try
for
anyone
who
has
the
chance
to
pick
one
of
these
up
drinkability
perhaps
too
sweet
to
drink
in
huge
quantities
but
the
abv
will
likely
hit
you
before
your
taste
buds
go
into
toxic
sugar
shock
very
disappointing
maybe
i
let
this
one
age
a
little
too
long
but
i
thought
with
the
high
abv
it
would
be
ok
this
wasnt
very
good
the
look
is
awful
the
taste
is
a
bit
on
the
medicine
side
and
it
feels
pretty
bad
i
expected
so
much
more
based
on
what
id
read
this
missed
the
target
on
most
fronts
despite
a
nice
aroma
the
taste
and
mouth
feel
were
both
surprisingly
disappointing
i
generally
love
golden
ales
and
the
surface
characteristics
of
this
beer
suggested
that
i
would
enjoy
this
one
as
well
but
the
actual
taste
did
not
bear
that
out
the
taste
was
a
little
stale
with
a
lot
of
sediment
at
the
bottom
i
enjoyed
some
of
their
other
offerings
on
tap
yesterday
but
this
one
from
the
bottle
is
a
muddled
sweet
mess
im
curious
to
know
what
the
brewer
was
after
with
this
one
maybe
a
mistake
and
under
attenuated
due
to
the
strong
sweet
flavor
and
lack
of
carbonation
reading
the
notes
saying
there
are
10
different
hops
used
is
interesting
this
may
have
helped
lead
to
the
muddled
flavors
10
different
hops
is
a
lot

try
to
balance

overall
this
is
a

that
integrate
nicely
poured
from
a
12oz

appears
to
be
a
thick

golden

absolutely
no

some

is
the
first
impression
and
its
pronounced
small

finish
unfortunately
espcially
for
one
said
to
have
10
different
varities
feel
is
on
the
thicker
side
very
low
carbonation
overall
its
not
what
i
was
expecting
and
while
not
a
terrible
beer
it
would
not
be
one
id
go
for
again
extremely
sweet
tasted
like
mead
almost
viscous
meh
had
a
batch
77
from
2009
wasnt
really
my
thing
almost
tasted
more
like
a
belgium
had
lots
of
dark
fruit
and
fig
tastes
maybe
it
oxidized
maybe
not
my
thing
regardless
i
wasnt
left
with
a
great
impression
on
tap
at
the
brewery
im
a
fan
of
this
style
this
one
has
decent
flavor
but
is
boozier
than
id
expect
o
pretty
big
disappointment
here
the
lack
of
carbonation
really
hurts
it
a
lot
it
kind
of
reminds
me
of
a
dfh
120min
gone
wrong
not
sure
if
i
got
a
bad
batch
or
what
but
its
certainly
a
let
down
from
what
i
was
hoping
for
3
5
overall
easily
a
beer
every
enthusiast
should
give
a
go
o
an
excellent
strong
ale
i
look
forward
to
trying
another
brew
from
hotd
i
didnt
mind
the
lack
of
carbonation
so
much
as
i
couldnt
stand
the
astringent
bitterness
smells
great
but
tastes
awful
drainpour
overly
sweet
a
hazy
golden
color
this
ones
strong
and
sweet
rather
unusual
not
sure
ive
ever
had
anything
thats
closely
comparable
its
like
drinking
a
super
sweet
and
sticky
super
boozy
glass
of
apple
juice
fabulously
inventive
but
its
so
specific
a
profile
im
not
sure
id
seek
this
one
out
again
and
again
have
to
be
in
the
precise
mood
the
barrel
aged
versions
would
be
interesting
to
try
this
is
definitely
a
beer
that
would
benefit
from
some
warm
soft
oakbourbonbrandywhatever
overtones
im
guessing
overall
4
0
a
nice
strong
ale
with
good
flavor
that
works
well
with
the
high
level
of
alcohol
without
just
masking
it
though
its
a
bit
of
an
undefined
style
this
one
manages
to
have
made
a
distinct
mark
on
my
memory
probably
my
least
favorite
of
the
collage
deconstruction
tasting
but
that
really
speaks
more
to
the
quality
of
the
beers
involved
than
it
does
the
lack
of
quality
of
this
one
on
tap
o
good
mix
of
spicy
and
sweet
a
slow
sipper
that
still
has
a
bit
of
heat
to
it
an
enjoyable
beer
but
depending
on
your
preference
for
fruit
you
may
not
care
for
it
overall
honestly
i
think
i
over
hyped
this
beer
and
it
didnt
live
up
to
my
expectations
i
have
only
had
two
beers
from
this
brewery
and
even
though
i
didnt
find
this
one
great
i
really
want
to
try
more
of
their
stuff
based
on
recommendation
overall
this
beer
smells
and
looks
great
but
i
need
some
more
texture
supposedly
bottle
conditioned
but
there
is
absolutely
no
carbonation
in
this
batch
extremely
disappointed
with
my
fred
experience
thus
far
appreciate
the
chance
to
try
this
but
it
doesnt
do
it
for
me
o
fred
is
an
everchanging
beer
revealing
more
and
more
of
itself
leaning
towards
its
alcohol
bite
as
it
warms
rye
and
bready
malts
make
for
a
great
combination
that
work
surprisingly
well
with
the
yeasts
fruity
esters
this
is
one
beer
im
pretty
excited
to
open
in
a
few
years
overall
a
really
complex
tasting
brew
lots
of
interesting
flavours
that
all
work
well
together
kind
of
like
a
barley
wine
meets
a
tripel
if
that
makes
any
sense
really
enjoyed
it
bottle
as
an
extra
from
homer321
a
long
time
want
killing
me
with
these
thanks

2014
pours
murky
orange
colored
with
no
head
at
all
a
bit
ugly
huge
sweet
aroma
of
malt
some
old
citrus
grapefruit
hops
honey
caramel
smells
soooo
sweet
flavor
follows
with
a
citrus
honeycomb
flavor
very
sweet
lemon
rind
notes
caramel
seems
to
be
a
lot
going
on
here
but
verging
on
cloying
syrupy
thick
mouthfeel
with
no
carbonation
totally
flat
ive
had
fred
from
the
wood
and
i
think
the
wood
aging
helps
makes
this
a
bit
more
drinkable
a
definite
sipper
honestly
this
is
better
than
the
score
i
gave
it
overall
if
it
had
some
carbonation
very
glad
i
got
to
try
it
though
o
a
nice
strong
golden
ale
that
is
well
balanced
o
very
good
with
the
strong
ale
class
ill
leave
it
as
interesting
for
my
personal
tastes
but
one
cannot
deny
that
this
is
a
well
made
ale
at
the
price
i
probably
would
not
purchase
again
as
this
is
not
my
preferred
style
o
good
but
not
particularly
memorable
o
i
have
had
this
before
quite
a
few
years
ago
but
long
enough
that
i
dont
remember
previous
tastings
or
have
anything
to
compare
to
after
7
years
in
a
bottle
this
is
still
quite
good
bordering
on
great
the
american
strong
ale
style
is
quite
diverse
and
could
result
in
beers
that
hardly
resemble
each
other
except
for
area
of
origin
and
alcohol
content
with
this
said
it
makes
it
very
difficult
to
have
an
expectation
of
a
beer
prior
to
trying
it
i
find
this
beer
to
be
fairly
unique
in
flavor
and
aroma
would
love
to
try
more
recent
vintages
to
compare
but
at
7
years
old
batch
69
is
holding
up
well
and
a
pleasure
to
drink
overall
a
good
beer
great
rye
character
but
missing
a
little
bit
in
the
rest
id
prefer
a
bit
more
citrus
and
a
bit
more
sweetness
but
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
the
flavor
profile
is
mostly
malty
with
a
touch
of
citrusy
sweetness
and
a
dry
bitter
finish
the
alcohol
is
present
and
not
entirely
pleasant
given
the
body
is
thinner
than
expected
in
a
beer
of
this
style
poured
a
cloudy
orange
copperish
color
with
quite
the
head
very
carbonated
as
expected
with
a
bottle
conditioned
ale
head
slowly
dissipated
with
lacing
left
all
the
way
down
the
glass
aroma
and
taste
were
great
toffee
caramel
candied
sugar
excellent
malt
flavors
medium
body
smooth
a
sipper
but
goes
down
easy
overall
very
flavorful
and
delicious
would
love
to
have
some
to
age
overall
interesting
beer
aside
from
the
gross
appearance
the
sweetness
is
not
overwhelming
but
certainly
a
major
component
the
esters
or
hop
varieties
that
contribute
the
fruitiness
is
welcome
in
adding
more
complexity
to
the
sweetness
its
not
my
cup
of
tea
and
i
wont
be
coming
back
to
this
but
it
is
certainly
an
interesting
beer
to
try
this
is
really
unfortunate
i
picked
this
two
days
ago
from
whole
foods
and
it
is
100
flat
no
head
no
bubbles
no
nothing
taste
is
still
ok
but
i
can
only
imagine
how
good
this
beer
might
be
with
the
balance
of
carbonation
mouth
feel
is
syrupy
and
overly
sweet
taste
but
you
get
the
hop
bitterness
and
malt
im
very
disappointed
though
i
was
expecting
this
to
be
a
great
experience
which
hasnt
been
ill
try
to
pick
another
bottle
soon
enough
overall
just
short
of
being
great
another
example
of
why
hair
of
the
dog
is
the
best
brewery
in
portland
moreover
you
dont
have
to
stand
in
line
or
go
to
the
brewery
to
drink
this
you
can
buy
it
in
a
store
a
must
try
and
one
i
will
be
drinking
again
very
fruity
for
a
golden
ale
rye
is
subtle
the
hops
are
significant
a
style
bender
in
the
best
way
overall
good
beer
would
buy
again
maybe
age
some
for
a
year
and
see
where
the
flavors
go
5
99
for
12
floz
pair
with
lamb
braised
pork
belly
or
flavored
cheeses
serve
at
cellar
temp
and
age
if
possible
overall
not
the
best
bottle
ive
had
slightly
oxidized
and
more
dark
malt
character
than
i
remember
still
a
good
beer
the
interesting
thing
at
work
is
here
the
way
the
spiciness
of
the
hops
plays
off
the
flavors
of
the
grain
i
dont
detect
rye
in
particular
but
theres
definitely
some
tasty
grain
presence
all
up
in
my
face
that
particular
combination
is
superbly
executed
but
between
the
color
the
sweetness
and
the
lack
of
carbonation
i
cant
help
but
wonder
if
im
drinking
someones
failed
homebrew
i
expect
the
lack
of
carbonation
is
really
divisive
when
it
comes
to
grading
this
beer
or
this
batch
anyway
im
not
really
digging
it
but
maybe
it
will
grow
on
me
batch

brornrngreat

allaround
unique
tasty

and
quite
noticeable
12oz

batch
89
pours
a
murky
light
brownish
orange
with
a
massive
chunky
head
2
inches
fair
amount

the
aroma
is
hoppy
tropical
fruits
alcohol
yeast
and
funk
kind
of
smells
like
a
hopped
up
boozey
pilsner
the
taste
is
boozey
upfront
with
some
butterscotch
and
orange
peel
some
clove
and
spice
notes
as
well
boozey
at
the
end
with
some
more
bitter
orange
peel
pretty
sweet
creamy
mouthfeel
pretty
complex
beer
with
alot
going
on
plenty
of
pilsner
characteristics
but
with
plenty
of
hops
and
alcohol
burn
i
dont
think
i
have
had
many
brews
like
this
one
overall
pretty
damn
good
o
stunning
how
this
beers
stood
the
test
of
time
while
the
carbonation
of
fred
can
be
all
over
the
map
batch
34
is
an
outstanding
example
i
am
not
trained
on
offflavours
or
oxidization
but
this
didnt
have
enough
of
either
to
detract
from
the
beautiful
malty
body
thats
developed
overall
its
a
great
brew
im
a
bit
burnt
out
by
ipas
at
that
time
but
with
the
significant
amount
of
hops
in
this
strong
ale
it
was
still
enjoyable
o
this
is
really
good
stuff
my
only
complaint
is
that
ive
got
to
go
wrap
presents
id
rather
sit
in
the
family
room
by
the
fire
and
sip
this
over
the
next
hour
focused
on
little
more
than
this
beer
and
some
good
tunes
wish
i
could
get
this
one
again
o
very
good
beer
the
10
abv
isnt
too
noticeable
goes
down
easily
over
all
this
is
a
very
unique
beer
and
its
way
different
than
anything
ive
had
before
my
second
hair
of
the
dog
beer
as
i
have
had
adam
before
looking
forward
to
trying
some
of
their
other
beers
but
i
wont
buy
this
again
as
it
was
a

overall

come
a
great
story
i
was
headed
out
to
start
a
new
job
in
montana
and
was
making
a
3
day
trip
out
of
it
one
of
those
nights
i
found
myself
in
portland
and
at
a
restaurant
that
was
half
bottle
shop
half
pasty
eatery
i
was
trying
a
few
brews
before
planning
to
spend
the
night
in
my
car
and
after
paying
the
tab
the
bartender
hands
me
a
bottle
in
a
brown
paper
bag
wait
a
year
before
drinking
this
he
said
almost
14
months
later
i
finally
allowed
myself
to
unveil
the
identity
but
its
a
bit
too
old
at
this
point
and
id
love
to
try
it
again
fresh
one
day
and
give
it
a
new
review
it
feels
a
little
onenote
at
this
point

this
beer
is
a
focused
and
decadent
beast
of
a
maltbomb
although
the
official
derivation
of
the
name
honors
craft
brewing
royalty
o
the
funky
melon
thing
really
sticks
out
the
most
memorable
thing
about
it
aside
from
the
honeynectar
like
body
like
an
icewine
or
a
moscato
i
could
tear
through
a
few
of
these
o
an
extreme
ale
that
seems
a
little
over
the
top
and
with
the
high
abv
a
bit
too
obvious
rough
and
unrefined
in
contrast
with
an
aged
firestone
dba
that
preceded
it
overall
this
beer
doesnt
mess
around
it
has
a
massive
flavor
profile
that
seems
to
be
just
too
over
the
top
for
me
i
cant
quite
tell
what
it
is
notes
this
beer
is
a
blast
to
drink
find
some
and
drink
it
its
totally
original
its
intensity
is
uniquely
awesome
and
amazingly
smooth
for
the
absolute
flavorsaromas
of
the
beer
dont
worry
too
much
if
you
dont
like
sweet
beer
either
its
really
fairly
balanced
but
ubermalty
this
one
was
a
little
all
over
the
map
for
me
if
you
hate
supersweet
beer
then
run
to
this
one
and
then
run
screaming
in
horror
in
the
opposite
direction
it
poured
almost
flat
and
the
massive
malt
bill
comes
right
out
of
the
glass
and
smacks
you
you
get
all
sorts
of
fruit
flavors
banana
cantaloupe
guava
and
whatever
else
your
nose
is
sensitive
enough
to
pick
up
however
the
sheriff
in
this
town
is
the
belgian
candy
sugar
it
is
so
syrupy
and
sweet
that
it
has
a
bit
of
a
sticky
taste
to
it
i
picked
up
the
slightest
bit
of
hops
toward
the
very
end
but
the
sugar
completely
overwhelms
all
sense
of
balance
as
my
first
hotd
beer
it
is
clear
these
guys
dont
mess
around
but
this
was
just
too
well
too
for
me
to
truly
love
o
very
well
done
like
what
these
guys
are
doing
with
beers
that
will
stand
the
test
of
time
overall
this
is
my
first
hotd
offering
and
im
impressed
and
enjoyed
this
one
would
like
to
try
their
others
there
is
a
lot
going
on
in
this
beer
and
this
makes
it
somewhat
confusing
but
at
the
same
time
enjoyable
because
it
is
so
complex
o
not
as
good
as
the
reputation
would
have
me
believe
not
impressed
my
first
hotd
and
i
wasnt
overly
impressed
it
wasnt
very
drinkable
due
to
the
aftertaste
not
sure
when
it
was
bottled
may
have
been
past
its
prime
o
totally
blown
away
by
this
one
age
your
fred
d
one
of
a
kind
i
wasnt
sure
if
i
liked
it
at
first
but
by
the
end
i
was
sad
to
see
it
gone
id
describe
it
as
almost
a
tripel
barleywine
hybrid
very
sweet
and
quite
enjoyable
this
is
good
enough
after
a
year
that
i
love
to
try
it
at
25
years
o
amazing
wow
i
am
thoroughly
impressed
by
this
beer
its
difficult
to
describe
but
i
would
say
it
combines
the
best
qualities
of
a
belgian
tripel
and
an
american
strong
ale
what
surprises
me
most
is
that
its
probably
not
even
the
best
beer
they
make
its
a
work
of
art
by
a
true
master
of
craft
beer
to
those
of
you
fortunate
enough
to
have
regular
access
to
these
beers
i
wish
to
express
my
great
envy
overall
not
impressed
with
this
one
theres
some
nice
flavors
in
there
but
the
end
product
is
a
bit
of
a
sweet
syrupy
mess
spent
way
to
much
on
this
bottle
the
batch
i
tasted
was
4
yrs
old
maybe
i
am
not
a
fan
of
aged
beers
very
heavy
mouthfeel
not
friendly
to
the
nose
way
to
much
bready
taste
and
a
huge
belgian
yeast
aftertaste
that
lingered
and
did
not
go
away
nice
to
try
something
different
but
we
decided
fred
can
just
lie
in
his
bed
permanently
o
this
is
a
great
beer
i
havent
had
many
golden
ales
but
this
is
definitely
among
the
best
ive
had
o
found
this
gem
in
pittsburgh
always
wanted
to
try
it
and
the
years
of
age
have
put
it
in
my
drinking
terms
cheers
a
bit
sweet
but
not
cloying
not
typicaly
my
bag
but
very
enjoyable
glassware
tulip
overall
very
complex
still
get
a
lot
of
alcohol
even
after
it
warms
up
glad
i
have
2
more
of
these
to
see
how
they
age
over
the
next
2
years
o
a
little
sweeter
than
i
prefer
but
quite
enjoyable
im
very
glad
i
got
to
try
it
fred
treads
on
barleywine
territory
but
is
most
definitely
not
deeply
complex
a
true
sipper
drinks
like
a
beast
and
that
gets
a
little
intense
as
the
beer
warms
still
aggressive
after
3
years
in
the
cellar
nice
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
but
i
wouldnt
order
another
overall
a
very
well
executed
balance
between
the
bitterness
of
the
hops
and
the
sweetness
of
the
malt
with
lots
of
tropical
fruit
honey
and
toffee
o
this
beer
is
many
things
toffee
citrus
hops
vanilla
breadiness
resin
it
is
definitely
one
to
share
as
a
nice
nightcap
given
the
abv
and
high
level
of
sweetness

d
this
might
be
my
favorite
hotd

super
easy

well
done
pours
a
cloudy

with
good
amount
of

is
wonderfully
complex
with

good

of

hop
and
a
tinge
of
alcohol
well
hidden
fruity
esters
abound
with
a
tropical
fruit
feel
and
definite
spicy
note
malt
is
mostly
indistinc
pale
but
with
a
definite
caramel
note
could
be
some
spicy
hop
here
as
well
and
also
some
pineapple
taste
is
fruity
and
spicy
again
citrus
hop
caramel
and
definite
alcoholic
notes
mouthfeel
is
great
except
for
the
alcoholic
aftertaste
overall
a
good
beer
not
sure
exactly
where
this
fits
in
the
style
guides
havent
had
this
much
ester
character
in
a
beer
in
a
while
o
a
very
straightforward
asa
that
hits
the
spot
pretty
well
if
i
had
another
id
sit
on
it
for
a
year
or
so
to
let
the
alcohol
simmer
down
overall
i
dont
get
it
im
sure
the
ingredients
are
top
notch
but
its
a
freaking
mess
too
much
going
on
with
10
hops
candi
sugar
rye
malt
and
booze
weird
beer
but
im
certainly
glad
i
was
able
to
try
it
golden
brown
voluminous
cream
colored

huge

nose
of
citrus

overall
very
nice
beer
i
hear
golden
ale
every
once
in
a
while
and
it
leaves
a
litlle
confused
because
its
not
defined
on
this
site
and
everything
i
know
about
beer
has
been
pretty
much
through
here
alone
anyways
after
trying
a
few
golden
ales
and
all
those
wonderful
summer
fruits
that
you
just
want
to
make
a
pie
out
of
i
get
a
bready
yeasty
taste
on
the
backend
that
brings
it
home
creamy
texture
and
a
full
body
with
mediumlight
carbonation
hard
to
believe
due
to
the
head
on
this
thing
make
this
beer
incredibly
drinkable
when
combined
with
the
taste
there
is
no
alcohol
that
i
can
taste
in
this
and
i
may
have
found

golden

with
a
hint
of
hops
and
hop
resin
on
the
finish
pretty
nice
flavors
going
on
my
one
complaint
is
that
the
syrupy
mouthfeel
combined
with
the
sweetness
makes
the
alcohol
pretty
evident
notchucknorrisaug

the
carbonation
isnt
overdone
as
i
worried
on
the
pour
nice
mouthfeel
o
pretty
nice
offering
from
hotd
here
was
expecting
to
be
blown
away
like
i
was
with
other
hotd
beers
but
i
wasnt
still
a
really
nice
beer
overall
this
is
one
of
the
most
flavorful
barleywines
ive
had
i
would
really
like
to
enjoy
this
in
cooler
weather
especially
with
its
warming
body
the
syrupy
mouthfeel
could
be
toned
down
but
allinall
i
loved
this
beer
o
you
candy
lovers
are
going
to
love
it
id
have
it
again
but
i
really
need
to
be
in
the
mood
for
it
o
i
had
to
wait
a
while
for
the
head
to
settle
which
it
never
did
so
i
had
to
work
my
way
through
the
foam
before
i
could
enjoy
the
beer
overall
pretty
tasty
easy
drinkability
the
alcohol
is
present
but
does
not
take
away
from
the
experience
overall
i
had
no
idea
this
was
a
barleywine
until
looking
at
the
info
on
ba
i
figured
it
was
an
asa
regardless
it
is
a
delightful
brew
almost
refreshing
given
the
abv
amongst
my
favorites
from
hotd
o
i
guess
that
too
much
carbonation
is
probably
better
than
not
enough
id
like
to
try
a
bottle
with
the
desired
amount
id
also
like
to
grab
some
more
of
these
to
see
how
they
are
with
some
age
on
them
im
not
sure
when
this
was
brewed
but
im
guessing
that
batch
82
is
one
of
the
newest
ones
needless
to
say
i
can
read
and
follow
directions
so
i
used
a
very
gentle
slow
pour
it
was
testament
to
its
carbonation
that
i
actually
briefly
got
some
lighttan
head
before
it
faded
to
wisps
color
was
a
deep
orangishamber
with
nequality
clarity
bupgoo
nose
was
richly
malty
like
toffee
mouthfeel
was
very
full
quite
carbonated
with
an
initial
heat
followed
by
a
wash
of
malty
sweetness
quite
toffeelike
finish
was
warming
and
sweet
my
oh
my
just
what
i
needed
on
a
swelteringly
hot
day
i
found
that
this
opens
up
a
lot
more
at
warmer
temperatures
the
sweetness
is
just
too
much
even
after
1015
minutes
out
of
the
refrigerator
its
still
sweet
no
matter
what
o
this
one
is
quite
the
curve
ball
but
make
no
mistake
this
pitch
is
a
strike
the
flavors
are
really
quite
interesting
and
the
mouth
takes
the
flavors
for
a
ride
flavor
sensations
of
gummies
spices
fruit
flesh
and
frothy
nonalcoholic
beverages
shine
like
stars
in
the
sky
this
would
be
a
fascinating
offering
to
age
i
just
dont
know
what
youd
end
up
with
the
alcohol
is
very
well
blended
but
not
missing
quite
good
and
shows
many
indications
that
it
could
improve
with
time
skål
o
this
is
definitely
a
huge
departure
from
what
im
used
to
with
barley
wines
so
much
complex
flavor
makes
this
one
worthy
for
any
style
however
if
i
had
one
major
criticism
of
this
beer
it
would
be
that
it
departs
the
underlying
style
so
much
and
instead
goes
into
such
an
ipaesque
territory
im
not
sure
if
this
doesnt
make
me
just
want
to
reach
for
a
better
ipa
whatever
the
case
if
you
like
barley
wines
you
need
to
get
this
it
will
surprise
you
oof
da
what
a
beer
heavy
sweet
strong
its
a
kick
in
the
pants
seriously
fruity
but
quite
complex
the
pour
was
a
downer
for
me
as
it
took
me
several
bouts
to
even
get
the
whole
bottle
poured
but
once
i
did
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
it
a
very
sweet
very
malty
barleywine
not
for
the
hopheads
but
i
like
it
snagged
a
bottle
of
this
at
my
local
place
one
ofthe
first
beers
i
bought
from
there
actually
this
was
something
i
had
wanted
to
try
since
i
enjoyed
adam
so
much
the
beer
poured
out
as
a
nice
hazy
honey
colored
brew
its
not
transparent
at
all
the
beer
looks
to
be
pretty
thick
the
head
its
pretty
good
to
for
a
little
while
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
strong
with
sweetness
boozy
malts
and
a
good
dose
of
hop
aromas
too
the
taste
is
sweet
and
has
some
elements
of
honey
in
there
to
me
there
is
a
zesty
hop
bite
in
there
as
well
the
flavors
of
maple
i
think
are
even
coming
through
in
the
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
is
pretty
heavy
its
got
a
nice
oily
body
to
it
that
coats
the
mouth
and
lingers
for
a
long
while
overall
id
have
to
say
this
is
my
favorite
hotd
release
yet
overall
an
excellent
barleywine
tons
of
sweet
and
fruity
flavors
something
i
wish
i
kept
around
more
often
at
23
years
old
this
one
is
showing
no
signs
of
slowing
down
either
o
waiting
for
the
head
to
die
down
was
worth
it
a
very
good
brew
i
really
enjoyed
the
mouthfeel
and
the
tastes
and
smell
really
blended
nicely
pours
a
slightly
hazy
copper
color
64
inch

of
an
offwhite
color
great
retention
and
great
lacing
smells
of
alcohol
sweet
malt
slight
citrus
yeast
and
slight
bread
fits
the
style
of
an
american
barleywine
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
alcohol
sweet
malt
hint
of
roasted
malt
slight

hops
slight
yeast
and
hint
of
bread
overall
great
appearance
good
aroma
body
and
blend
overall
not
a
traditional
american
barleywine
very
unique
aroma
and
taste
profile
easy
to
drink
even
with
the
big
body
interesting
o
hair
of
the
dog
has
really
impressed
me
as
of
late
why
did
i
wait
so
long
to
get
into
their
beers
this
beer
is
great
fresh
a
bit
sweet
young
and
has
all
of
the
components
to
be
incredible
after
some
time
in
the
cellar
cheers
do
drinkability
is
low
i
kept
going
back
and
forth
on
whether
i
should
drain
pour
this
being
conflicted
that
it
might
foam
up
and
clog
my
drain
and
pipes
and
then
getting
scared
as
to
what
is
going
to
happen
to
my
digestive
tract
eventually
i
lost
the
battle
with
this
beer
getting
knocked
down
by
the
yeast
and
carbonation
and
then
finally
tkod
by
a
surprising
amount
of
sweet
cloyingness
that
manages
to
rise
from
seemingly
nowhere
and
assault
me
in
the
finish
stay
away
unless
you
can
get
a
guarantee
you
are
getting
a
clean
bottle
which
from
my
now
02
track
record
from
hair
of
the
dog
makes
me
think
it
may
be
harder
than
it
seems
take
out
insurance
o
thats
a
very
solid
beer
its
different
from
everything
i
had
before
but
is
still
quite
good
o
this
is
a
great
beer
and
i
would
drink
this
a
lot
if
i
lived
in
portland
smells
like
sugary
malt
cooked
sugars
and
rye
malts
sweet
candied
raisins
and
molasses
a
subtle
grassyearthy
hop
aroma
presents
itself
as
the
beer
warms
first
thing
i
notice
from
the
initial
sip
is
how
incredibly
silky
smooth
this
beer
is
very
low
carbonation
but
mediumthin
bodied
lots
of
sugary
malt
flavor
up
front
followed
closely
by
caramel
sweet
estery
fruit
some
honey
and
rye
a
touch
of
spicy
hops
in
the
finish
and
another
smattering
of
malty
sweetness
coats
the
mouth
with
slick
oiliness
very
unique
doesnt
really
fit
the
classification
of
american
barleywine
but
i
dont
think
there
is
a
style
where
this
would
fit
overall
a
very
deliciously
sweet
beer
like
that
of
the
juice
straight
out
of
a
fruit
o
i
enjoyed
this
beer
except
it
was
a
touch
too
sweet
for
me
but
still
remained
quite
tasty
i
continue
to
love
hotd
products
o
this
is
pretty
good
i
was
expecting
something
different
but
this
definitely
didnt
let
me
down
very
creamy
and
smooth
mouthfeel
a
really
solid
barleywine
sweet
with
a
hint
of
bitterness
very
good
another
winner
from
a
great
brewer
overall
this
is
a
very
heavy
and
sweet
beer
i
enjoyed
it
but
i
could
only
see
myself
drinking
one
of
these
in
a
sitting
i
will
be
seeking
more
batch
78
this
beer
pours
somewhere
in
between
dark
gold
and
bright
copper
in
color
with
a
three
finger
cream
colored
head
this
one
may
take
awhile
to
calm
down
it
smells
of
very
bready
sweet
malts
i
get
a
lot
of
bisquick
biscuit
dough
from
it
it
also
features
a
light
but
sweet
caramel
malt
aspect
that
is
rather
subdued
but
pairs
well
with
the
aforementioned
biscuity
aromas
it
tastes
of
sweet
caramel
malts
with
a
nice
honey
covered
biscuit
aftertaste
that
is
delicious
the
whole
profile
isnt
typical
of
a
barleywine
but
it
works
rather
well
it
is
moderately
sweet
but
isnt
overpowering
in
the
least
it
isnt
overly
sticky
on
the
palate
either
but
boy
does
the
head
stick
to
the
side
of
the
glass
its
probably
one
of
the
most
drinkable
barleywines
around
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
from
hair
of
the
dog
once
again
this
is
a
nice
brew
it
is
very
malty
but
also
has
a
bitter
sweetness
to
it
it
is
sweet
enough
to
be
more
an
afterdinner
beer
pours
a
very
dark
yellow
almost
amber
massive
white
head
that
settles
to
about
14
inch
very
hazy
brew
aroma
is
very
sweet
candi
fruity
hops
yeast
spice
some
leather
and
vanilla
characters
in
the
nose
as
well
flavor
is
very
sweet
spicey
rye
and
bitter
in
the
finish
lots
of
spice
leather
and
other
flavors
going
on
in
the
flavor
very
sticky
and
sweet
in
the
finish
well
carbonated
almost
light
on
the
tongue
due
to
the
carbonation
alcohol
well
perceived
throughout
very
good
barleywine
very
interesting
beer
but
at
the
same
time
i
feel
it
is
not
sure
what
it
wants
to
be
which
i
like
it
alows
the
drinker
to
make
his
own
conclusion
about
the
beer
thus
forcing
the
drinker
to
think
about
what
he
is
drinking
which
is
a
very
good
thing
each
sip
of
this
beer
leaves
me
reaching
for
another
its
a
very
well
balanced
beer
for
being
10
abv
hair
of
the
dog
brewing
claims
to
be
loyal
pure
and
faithful
they
also
claim
to
have
a
wet
nose
regardless
of
their
nose
this
beer
is
delicious
i
would
see
this
as
a
beer
to
drink
on
celebration
not
your
everyday
brew
i
love
it
bottoms
up
people
o
good
o
this
is
an
interesting
beer
would
be
great
with
some
age
would
buy
this
one
again
for
sure
o
this
has
good
drinkability
i
think
it
is
a
bit
of
a
sipper
but
the
flavor
makes
me
not
want
to
put
it
down
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
the
flavor
is
great
and
complex
leaving
different
flavors
in
your
mouth
with
each
sip
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
i
will
be
picking
this
up
again
no
doubt
o
this
is
a
great
barleywine
with
tons
of
flavor
it
borders
on
being
a
bit
sweet
but
the
sweetness
goes
well
with
the
rye
and
hops
o
i
have
to
say
i
am
not
a
fan
of
this
over
time
it
may
get
better
and
if
you
happen
to
buy
one
i
would
recommend
not
drinking
it
because
you
will
have
wasted
your
7
ish
dollars
a
12
oz
well
done
from
a
23
year
old
bottle
from
the
cellar
could
be
older
than
that
had
lots
of
life
left
in
it
definitely
a
night
cap
beer
great
beer
a
little
underhopped
for
an
american
barleywine
but
not
unpleasant
taste
is
sweetspicy
toasty
raisiny
character
with
hint
of
spicy
resiny
hops
and
hint
of
citrus
mostly
grapefruit
but
very
mild
it
has
noticeably
warming
alcohol
but
is
not
too
boozy
its
a
bit
oily
creamy
in
feel
fairly
well
balanced
but
definitely
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
its
good
but
not
great
oexcellent
would
love
to
have
tons
more
of
this
the

and
nothing
is
offensive
at
all
about
this
beer
huge
thanks

to
get
into
the

beautiful

to
the

very
small

fades
quickly
on

palate
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
flat
carbonation
wise
leading
to
a
somewhat
thick
and
chewy
beer
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
that
i
have
put
of
trying
for
way
too
long
highly
recommended
creamy
and
medium
to
full
bodied
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
for
10
00
but
has
a
warming
effect
im
not
sure
what
else
needs
to
be
said
this
is
a
great
beer
which
i
will
seek
out
again
hair
of
the
dog
throws
a
changeup
at
the
barleywine
style
its
not
bad
and
certainly
different
from
the
diet
of
fastballs
that
were
all
used
to
seeing
but
sometimes
a
good
93
mph
heater
gets
the
job
done
better
than
a
slightly
better
than
average
change
on
the
outside
corner
o
not
bad
for
my
1st
hotd
brew
overall
a
very
nice
barleywine
id
be
really
interested
to
see
this
with
some
age
on
it
thanks
to
aussy13
for
sending
this
my
way
pours
a
hazy
orangeish
to
yellow
color
with
an
off
white
head
in
the
aroma
dry
fruit
and
candy
sugar
in
the
taste
dry
candy
sugar
with
yeast
and
fruit
notes
a
smooth
and
medium
to
bigger
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
hint
of
fruit
in
the
aftertaste
nice
mix
of
fruit
and
yeast
more
an
american
triple
than
a
barleywine
this
is
definitely
an
american
barleywine
the
flavors
are
a
bit
punchy
and
those
pacific
northwest
hops
definitely
want
you
to
know
theyre
there
its
not
my
favorite
american
barleywine
but
ill
likely
buy
it
again
if
i
see
it
mouthfeeloverall
medium
bodied
with
low
carbonation
this
beer
is
quite
creamy
and
sticky
in
the
mouth
this
is
the
standout
category
for
this
beer
in
my
opinion
overall
a
very
good
barleywine
but
not
quite
elite
i
dig
everything
ive
had
from
hair
of
the
dog
and
im
really
excited
to
try
fred
from
the
wood
to
see
what
the
barrels
do
for
this
beer
o
overall
decent
barleywine
nothing
to
write
home
about
a
bit
rich
and
syrupy
malt
heavy
all
in
all
this
is
a
great
brew
if
you
like
the
style
i
am
glad
ive
gotten
to
try
this
brew
twice
very
sugary
with
hints
of
bitterness
if
you
like
that
sort
of
thing
then
this
brew
is
for
you

darkness
snifter
poured
a
massively
hazy
redorange
with
a
minimal
offwhite
head
maintained
phenomenal
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
caramel
citrus
and
citrus
hop
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
caramel
citrus
citrus
hop
and
subtle
sweet
alcohol
it
had
a
medium
feel
on
the
palate
with
mild

overall
this
was
an
excellent
brew
the
citrus
aspect
on
this
one
really
wowed
me
as
it
kept
me
coming
back
for
more
great
aroma
here
as
well
while
this
brew
isnt
very
complex
it
does
quite
well
with
the
flavors
and
aromas
it
has
present
if
you
havent
tried
this
one
you
need
to
get
off
your
ass
and
do
so
even
if
you
have
to
traade
of
it
batch
80
in
a
tulip
pours
a
sunset
amber
with
a
beautiful
frothy
head
and
leaves
nice
sticky
lacing
unfortunately
for
me
this
is
where
the
good
looks
end
nose
and
taste
is
like
a
completly
out
of
balance
doggie
claws
overly
sweet
malts
and
citrus
on
the
nose
with
little
hop
balance
and
alcohol
esters
more
of
the
same
in
the
mouth
as
well
with
a
hot
finish
reminds
me
somewhat
of
stone
old
guardian
2011
which
is
not
a
good
thing
not
a
fan
but
at
least
its
nice
trade
bait
wow
very
impressive
this
beer
is
delicious
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
to
date
highly
drinkable
the
abv
is
high
but
well
hidden
id
like
to
thank
gkunkle
for
the
bottle
o
its
a
darn
good
beer
but
teetering
on
undrinkable
to
me
although
i
think
hotd
did
exactly
what
they
wanted
to
do
here
but
to
me
its
a
good
beer
now
as
a
sipper
well
see
how
an
aged
version
holds
up
this
beer
also
convinced
me
to
give
hotd
another
shot
since
my
batch
77
adam
experience
nearly
ruined
my
opinion
of
the
brewery
o
not
super
drinkable
for
me
as
i
found
it
way
too
sweet
otherwise
though
a
pleasant
drinker
couldnt
really
imagine
having
more
than
a
bottle
drink
ability
is
high
it
keeps
you
combing
back
for
more
and
stays
around
long
enough
in
the
plate
to
satisfy
the
only
hit
is
the
high
abv
could
be
rough
if
i
drink
these
all
night
long
overall
this
is
a
really
good
beer
not
nearly
the
alcohol
flavor
youd
expect
from
a
10
abv
brew
glad
i
aged
this
for
2
years
i
do
have
to
say
this
is
probably
not
worth
the
elevated
price
tag
for
the
single
12
oz
bottle
really
awesome
beer
glad
i
revisited
it
o
i
love
it
get
you
some
mouthfeel
is
smooth
rich
and
syrupy
fits
the
aroma
and
taste
profile
very
well
drinkability
is
hindered
by
the
incredible
sweetness
but
at
least
it
is
a
tasty
sweetness
and
not
something
that
makes
the
beer
difficult
to
drink
definitely
recommended
and
i
can
see
how
cherry
versions
of
these
beers
would
be
so
highly
sought
after
they
must
be
like
dessert
glad
i
finally
had
the
chance
to
have
this
and
others
from
hotd
md
the
beer
was
mildly
carbonated
but
the
hops
kind
of
tackle
your
tongue
does
not
drink
like
a
normal
barleywine
not
very
malty
and
very
reminiscent
of
an
ipa
still
it
was
very
interesting
and
well
balanced
a
nice
beer
not
worth
5
00
for
a
12
oz
all
the
time
but
worth
it
occasionally
d
very
drinkable
for
the
first
beer
but
i
think
the
sugar
would
stop
me
after
two
d
very
drinkable
in
spite
of
the
heat
from
the
booze
the
booze
is
an
enhancement
and
adds
to
the
flavor
that
said
it
will
still
keep
you
from
pounding
this
one
a
great
beer
d
drinkability
is
surprisingly
good
for
this
beer
while
the
alcohol
comes
through
quite
a
bit
it
doesnt
take
away
from
the
beer
and
doesnt
seem
to
make
it
any
more
difficult
to
drink
d
what
a
sipper
this
is
delicious
but
i
wish
i
had
waited
a
little
longer
to
drink
this
one
rich
luxurious
feel
slow
sipper
to
be
sure
hard
to
say
how
much
aging
may
benefit
this
tasty
monster
paper
and
fire
angel
and
liar
the
devil
of
one
another
rip
dio
fizzy
mouthfeel
from
start
to
finish
a
very
lively
beer
overall
this
is
a
very
complex
and
pleasing
brew
making
me
likely
to
order
a
few
but
the
high
abv
and
such
a
mouthfull
of
flavor
leave
me
torn
on
the
drinkability
of
this
one
a
tremendous
beer
though
i
tend
to
disagree
with
the
barleywine
classification
tastes
almost
like
a
belgian
golden
to
me
d
fairly
drinkable
really
big
and
complex
beer
so
it
is
a
real
sipper
but
it
is
very
enjoyable
there
are
a
lot
of
flavors
mixing
around
and
while
it
is
not
quite
perfectly
balanced
it
is
very
enjoyable
d
ones
enough
for
me
too
sweet
12oz
bottle
batch
79
pours
hazy
apricot
with
offwhite
head
very
active
carbonation
aroma
of
dried
fruit
some
wood
and
citrus
but
the
fruit
dominatesmostly
sweet
dried
apricot
taste
is
sweet
with
some
hop
bitterness
full
bodied
with
thick
sticky
texture
very
smooth
the
alcohol
is
noticeable
in
the
finish
but
really
hits
the
chest
and
throat
really
nice
there
is
a
nice
hop
flavor
but
it
gets
a
bit
drowned
out
by
the
sweetness
and
alcohol
the
pilsnerrye
malts
become
very
similar
to
a
barleywine
sweetness
it
almost
seemed
nicely
balanced
except
the
sweetness
and
alcohol
lingers
on
and
on
and
eventually
takes
over
and
makes
this
one
a
bit
difficult
to
finish
note
as
it
is
listed
as
a
barleywine
on
ba
that
makes
a
little
more
sense
on
the
taste
but
doesnt
really
change
anything
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
offering
at
times
it
was
a
bit
cloyingly
sweet
in
my
opinion
but
the
flavors
were
solid
and
interesting
the
amount
of
heat
was
really
spot
on
definitely
something
to
pick
up
and
i
have
to
imagine
it
will
cellar
well
drinkability
was
just
as
good
as
the
flavor
and
mouthfeel
maybe
i
will
revist
this
beer
when
it
has
some
age
on
it
the
fresh
was
just
too
much
overall
very
drinkable
ive
had
this
many
many
years
ago
honey
malty
aspects
most
memorable
very
tasty
brew
mouthfeel
is
slick
and
has
only
a
mild
presence
of
carbonation
i
drink
my
fair
share
of
over
10
abv
beers
but
this
one
is
really
boozy
one
is
definitely
enough
drinkabilityits
got
some
great
complex
flavors
and
is
a
nice
sipping
beer
i
think
that
this
beer
may
still
need
to
do
some
more
aging
to
round
out
the
rough
edges
even
though
its
already
at
least
2
years
old
d
this
one
really
smacked
me
upside
the
head
and
then
grew
on
me
a
bit
it
is
not
one
i
would
drink
frequently
although
i
look
forward
to
seeing
what
a
little
age
will
do
drinkability
is
high
theres
no
harshness
to
this
beer
its
big
but
subtle
sweet
then
bitter
and
delicious
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
standard
pint
glass
showed
very
little
trace
of
head
or
lacing
but
had
tons
of
sediment
the
nose
was
smooth
with
tons
of
sweet
flavor
the
taste
was
amazing
it
practically
exploded
with
hops
and
malt
sweet
to
the
taste
but
packed
a
full
10
abv
punch
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
and
will
age
my
others
for
some
time
easy
to
drink
strong
but
sweet
poured
from

2010
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
clear
amber
dark
golden
color
with
a
large
beige
head
not
as
light
as
most
golden
ales
but
lighter
than
most
barleywines
i
have
drank
aroma
is
sweet
honey
a
touch
of
citric
hops
and
some
alcohol
flavor
is
honey
hops
candy
sugar
sweet
malts
and
a
bit
of
alcohol
tastes
sweeter
than
the
aroma
suggests
medium
mouthfeel
and
a
nice
carbonation
throughout
along
with
mild
sediments
so
pour
slowly
to
keep
the
sediments
in
the
bottle
as
much
as
possible
this
was
one
of
the
better
golden
ales
barleywine
in
this
particular
style
i
had
edit
i
guess
theyre
calling
it
an
american
strong
ale
now
whatever
it
is
its
really
good
d
a
sipper
that
i
enjoyed
as
a
change
of
pace
from
your
normal
barleywine
nothing
mindblowing
but
nice
to
try
for
something
different
give
it
a
shot
cant
recommend
but
id
drink
it
again
drinkability
i
would
drink
this
all
the
time
but
just
not
daily
its
a
strong
beer
with
a
lot
of
character
its
definitely
something
you
can
pair
with
food
but
i
would
drink
it
on
its
own
any
day
reminded
me
of
duvel
but
much
better
could
probably
been
safely
cellared
another
year
or
two
with
the
10
backbone
and
the
great
carbonation
retention
recomend
a
very
slow
pour
to
let
the
yeast
settle
to
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
and
leave
about
an
ounce
in
the
bottle
for
the
best
intended
flavor
thanks
to
santa
for
this
one
poured
into
a
tulip
the
beer
pours
a
murky
amber
with
a
thin
creamy
layer
of
off
white
head
that
settles
down
with
thin
sticky
lace
the
aroma
is
spicy
golden
raisins
with
a
musty
toffee
finish
with
candied
sugar
to
finish
out
the
aroma
the
taste
is
full
of
dark
fruits
raisins
and
figs
come
to
mind
with
a
musty
flavor
and
a
very
sweet
caramel
candied
sugar
finish
really
a
nice
balance
of
dark
malty
flavors
with
a
sweet
toffee
finish
feels
really
nice
with
a
big
full
body
and
subtle
carbonation
like
most
barley
wines
this
one
is
kind
of
a
boozy
sipper
really
enjoyable
and
i
always
want
more
drinkability
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
will
be
picking
some
more
up
again
good
drinkablility
tasty
beer
i
really
dont
think
it
is
a
barleywine
db
a
very
interesting
barleywine
to
say
the
least
the
hops
are
nice
but
are
pretty
random
the
sweetness
is
the
big
flaw
here
to
me
it
gets
cloying
drinkability
as
far
as
the
style
goes
its
one
of
the
better
barleywines
ive
tried
honestly
its
still
not
a
style
that
i
would
regularly
reach
for
i
would
say
that
if
you
like
barleywines
youll
probably
like
this
brew
d
well
i
would
go
with
a
no
compared
to
other
barley
wines
i
have
had
even
though
the
bottle
calls
it
a
golden
perhaps
let
this
one
age
a
few
years
and
see
if
the
paint
thinner
goes
away
and
it
cools
down
overall
very
interesting
its
quite
enjoyable
looking
forward
to
trying
the
wood
version
overall
quite
sweet
but
enough
citrus
hop
bitterness
to
keep
it
from
becoming
cloying
alcohol
has
a
strong
presence
throughout
but
i
dont
mind
that
in
a
big
beer
another
winner
from
hair
of
the
dog
drink
3
years
in
between
the
last
two
drinks
i
dont
think
i
will
be
going
that
far
this
time
ill
have
to
have
one
again
sooner
a
very
tasty
brew
and
delicious
at
that
md
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
creamy
alcohol
is
well
hidden
by
the
sweetness
it
has
a
syrup
like
quality
that
adds
a
nice
texture
overall
it
is
a
good
beer
it
just
might
be
a
bit
to
sweet
and
syrupy
for
me
a
bit
too
sweet
and
cloying
to
be
considered
highly
drinkable
however
fred
does
okay
in
this
category
for
its
style
d
ok
one
bottle
is
enough
the
first
time
i
had
this
beer
it
was
about
four
years
old
and
fantastic
slightly
younger
its
still
very
good
but
ill
definitely
be
aging
future
bottles
to
reach
that
potential
an
excellent
offering
from
hotd
as
always
really
enjoyed
it
d
a
sipper
for
sure
but
a
decent
one
for
a
chilly
winter
day
this
is
pretty
fresh
its
the
newest
batch
so
some
time
on
it
could
really
help
this
develop
dan
american
micro
classic
d
despite
my
disappointment
in
the
sweetness
it
was
still
a
fairly
pleasant
complex
brew
tone
it
down
a
bit
and
it
would
be
a
real
winner
if
not
definitely
consider
this
a
for
dessert
beer
not
an
after
dessert
sipper
a
terrific
beer
thats
tough
to
classify
where
i
was
worried
about
the
apple
upstart
the
other
fruits
spiciness
earthiness
and
intensifying
bitterness
really
rounds
out
the
beer
very
late
in
the
finish
the
taste
mimics
the
nose
to
a
large
extent
though
some
of
the
darker
more
fruity
flavors
take
over
just
a
bit
mild
green
apple
skin
the
background
nice
touch
of
caramel
and
light
brown
sugar
good
feel
with
a
nice
body
and
a
hint
of
booze
in
the
finish
drinks
quite
well
and
is
another
solid
brew
from
a
brewery
that
just
cant
seem
to
miss
very
impressed
this
is
a
good
beer
could
be
great
with
more
carbonation
and
a

heavy

there
are
no

one
so
maybe
a
bit
too
much
priming
sugars
either
way
it
is
distracting
and
not
how
the
style
should
be
drinkability
is
good
despite
the
carbonation
i
actually
kind
of
like
a
bit
more
carbonation
in
this
beer

not
quite
this

very

with

minimal

quite
a

a

probably
would

it
is
damn
tasty
d
i
can
probably
have

of
these
but
that

drinking

always
a

can
really
taste

a
found
this
one
to
be
a
bit
rough
decent
but
maybe
a
little
age
would
have
helped
even
it
out
a
bit
this
is
quite
a
strange
barleywine
not
what
i
expected
for
sure
almost
like
if
you
combined
alesmith
horny
devil
and
a
much
less
poisonous
stone
14th
anniversary
crazy
sweet
all
over
the
place
but
enjoyable
hard
to
imagine
how
this
ages
d
for
the
amount
of
alcohol
content
in
this
beer
its
actually
quite
drinkable
although
the
stickiness
can
slow
you
down
d
overall
this
is
a
good
enjoyable
beer
it
wouldnt
be
my
first
choice
in
choosing
a
barleywine
but
its
still
worth
getting
to
try
out
beer
is
thin
and
sweet
with
a
dry
finish
its
a
little
odd
all
the
flavor
is
in
the
front
half
of
the
palate
and
then
it
kind
of
falls
flat
i
like
it
i
do
i
think
its
a
good
beer
and
even
for
a
barleywine
i
enjoy
it
i
just
wish
there
was
some
sort
of
late
flavor
or
bitterness
i
would
recommend
it
this
has
a
nice
full
body
to
it
making
it
a
decent
sipper
the
carbonation
aids
in
bringing
out
all
the
flavors
and
makes
for
a
creamy
bubbly
feeling
hope
to
get
more
m
smooth
dry
and
warming
this
is
a
quality
barleywine
or
whatever
it
may
be
classified
as
that
seems
to
be
a
combination
of
styles
that
centers
around
a
barleywine
a
unique
beer
and
one
that
id
certainly
have
again
if
given
the
accessability
d
meh
it
was
way
too
sweet
imo
a
decent
beer
but
probably
would
never
buy
it
again
at
least
it
was
in
a
twelve
ounce
bottle
so
kudos
to
hotd
for
that
poured
this
big
boy
into
a
sam
perfect
pint
glass
and
it
blew
up
in
front
of
me
a
billowy
thick
head
grows
upon
itself
as
i
temper
my
pour
nice
caramely
gold
color
and
tons
of
lacing
as
i
drink
taste
hmmm
initially
i
get
a
very
candied
maltyness
followed
by
a
minimal
citrus
flavor
that
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
mouth
feel
is
nice
and
oily
drinkability
is
lowered
by
the
fact
that
this
is
just
a
heavy
beer
both
on
the
palate
on
in
the
gut
drinkability
is
ok
lots
of
alcohol
lots
of
hops
finished
the
12oz
but
that
is
plenty
batch
78
pours
a
dark
golden
color
with
a
extremely
large
head
aroma
is
floral
yet
fruity
at
the
same
time
taste
is
sweet
slight
alcohol
burn
belgian
sugar
and
some
cotton
candy
i
dont
think
i
would
call
this
a
barleywine
very
unique
like
the
other
hair
of
the
dog
beers
ive
tried
ill
definately
pick
up
another
one
of
these
to
cellar
with
my
adam
edit
i
noticed
that
i
give
this
beer
a
higher
overall
mark
than
the
fred
from
the
wood
from
what
i
recall
i
did
enjoy
fftw
more
finding
it
more
complex
than
its
nonbarrelaged
brother
might
have
to
revisit
it
and
make
rating
adjustments
in
the
future
drinkability
excellent
beer
and
interesting
mix
of
styles
12
oz
bottle
batch
76
poured
into
a
unibroue
tulip
popped
the
cap
and
slowly
the
foam
started
to
work
itself
out
of
the
bottle
poured
into
the
glass
creating
a
huge
gigantic
tall
head
forever
retention
fluffy
so
much
foam
cant
even
note
the
lacing
aroma
dominated
by
candy
sugar
notes
and
malt
sweetness
almost
a
touch
de
dolle
ish
in
the
nose
taste
is
still
a
bit
hot
maybe
some
taste
of
over
ripened
fruit
maybe
some
banana
some
dates
and
maybe
plums
i
guess
the
style
is
a
barley
wine
and
the
bottle
says
golden
special
ale
and
i
suppose
this
is
a
golden
barley
wine
quite
interesting
would
love
to
try
this
with
a
ton
of
age
on
it
but
pretty
good
right
now
d
this
one
hides
the
alcohol
well
if
i
werent
feeling
a
bit
tipsy
after
only
one
i
expect
i
could
knock
back
a
fair
few
of
these
in
a
night
wonderful
beer
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
and
drinkable
barleywine
i
wish
i
had
tried
it
sooner
i
have
been
really
impressed
with
everything
i
have
tried
from
this
brewery
so
far
the
abv
is
quite
sneaky
in
this
brew
and
while
the
heavy
flavors
slow
your
consumption
somewhat
much
like
the
other
hair
of
the
dog
beers
you
cant
seem
to
put
down
your
glass
overall
i
really
like
this
beer
its
got
tons
of
depth
and
tons
of
flavor
its
a
big
beer
so
i
couldnt
drink
a
ton
of
these
but
i
will
definitely
search
more
of
these
out
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
brown
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
classic
american
barleywine
with
notes
of
caramel
malt
and
oranges
the
flavor
is
sweet
caramel
sweet
oranges
toffee
brown
sugar
and
a
touch
of
alcohol
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
a
great
beer
that
didnt
disappoint
great
refreshing
drinkability
abv
doesnt
reduce
drinkability
at
all
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
strong
carbonation
a
little
overbearing
overall
a
highly
drinkable
barleywine
a
very
good
port
substitute
with
your
after
dinner
cheese
plate
i
would
like
to
see
how
this
develops
after
laying
down
for
a
year
or
two
drinks
like
the
ravages
of
time
age
seems
to
have
turned
this
beer
into
a
mead
sugary
but
with
a
strong
backbone
of
flavor
to
add
interest
id
like
to
try
it
fresh
someday
perhaps
i
am
at
fault
for
opening
this
one
prematurely
i
will
seek
out
another
bottle
in
the
future
drinkability
huge
beer
very
complex
excellent
for
sipping
tastes
very
refined
i
really
like
this
the
beer
is
nicely
understated
and
doesnt
overdo
the
hops
while
still
ensuring
they
are
present
wow
somehow
this
beer
has
close
to
the
depth
and
flavor
of
a
10yr
old
j
w
lees
but
its
less
than
a
year
old
its
somewhere
between
a
good
american
barleywine
and
an
amazing
english
barleywine
i
dont
know
if
its
that
this
beer
is
simply
masterfully
crafted
or
if
it
just
hits
all
the
notes
that
are
important
to
me
either
way
i
highly
recommend
buying
it
if
you
see
it
nice
drinkable
bigger
beer
not
too
sweet
not
too
heavy
overall
this
is
one
of
my
new
favorite
sippers
if
only
it
were
easier
for
me
to
get
overall
this
is
a
very
well
done
american
barleywine
its
on
the
maltierenglish
side
but
thats
what
i
prefer
anyways
really
glad
some
california
bas
hooked
me
up
with
this
beer
ive
got
another
in
the
cellar
and
im
excited
to
see
what
a
couple
of
years
does
to
this
beer
worth
seeking
out
yep
a
big
unapologetic
beer
this
one
with
more
than
a
whack
of
alcohol
but
its
really
quite
suitable
for
the
style
and
for
what
its
trying
to
do
im
more
disappointed
that
i
havent
found
any
recognition
from
the
brewers
that
they
fucked
up
on
this
batch
if
youve
found
where
they
have
please
pm
me
overall
this
is
a
strong
and
flavorful
beer
not
my
favorite
but
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
really
malty
sweet
beers
it
has
a
decent
balance
and
a
nice
complexity
overall
i
have
just
got
around
to
giving
adam
and
fred
a
try
and
ill
definitely
be
checking
out
more
beers
from
this
brewery
highly
recommended
for
fans
of
big
bold
assertive
complex
beers
o
i
liked
this
beer
much
better
fresh
im
not
convinced
some
age
isnt
good
for
it
but
at
least
for
me
7
years
was
too
long
even
if
youre
careful
you
are
liable
to
get
close
to
a
half
glass
full
of
foam
very
dense
with
the
tiniest
bubbles
imaginable
the
foam
covers
the
entire
inside
of
the
glass
so
no
lacing
per
se
cloudy
reddish
orange
color
opaque
but
not
so
as
to
not
capture
light
within
it
very
active
bubble
beads
within
the
nose
has
a
sunshiny
honeyed
quality
to
it
sweet
tangerine
and
pink
grapefruit
trump
the
oats
and
granola
the
latter
sweet
too
banana
nectarine
and
apricot
fruit
caramel
malted
milk
balls
the
citrus
most
obvious
throughout
fullbodied
and
creamy
full
but
soft
mouth
presence
the
tangerine
lime
pink
grapefruit
big
and
bold
here
too
more
honey
molasses
milk
chocolate
and
caramel
to
increase
the
sweetness
factor
touch
of
vanillin
tinged
booziness
rye
and
oats
without
getting
too
grainy
fruit
cocktail
nature
to
the
nectarine
peach
apricot
pear
cherry
fruit
straight
out
of
the
can
the
carbonation
accommodates
the
creaminess
more
of
a
real
slow
churn
than
anything
else
this
does
not
strike
me
a
categorizable
beer
more
an
experimental
hybrid
however
you
take
it
its
sure
yummy
pours
clear
amber
body
with
bubbly
white
head
smells
of
alcohol
syrup
candied
burnt
fruit
the
alcoholic
booze
and
tropical
fruit
take
over
in
the
taste
and
dont
let
go
it
slicks
the
palate
with
boozy
flavors
a
strong
beer
that
serves
best
as
an
after
dinner
drink
if
you
are
looking
for
something
similar
to
an
ipa
or
a
belgian
golden
try
this
one
drinkability
this
is
a
great
example
of
the
american
barleywine
done
well
sweet
and
complex
maltiness
paired
with
just
enough
floral
and
bittering
hops
to
prevent
the
beer
from
becoming
cloying
the
further
you
get
into
the
glass
the
more
unique
notes
that
come
to
your
attention
satisfying
and
enjoyable
from
beginning
to
end
a
unique
blend
of
styles
that
verges
on
too
sweet
and
limits
drinkability
somewhat
but
the
dry
finish
helps
keep
the
experience
balanced
poured
a
darkgoldish
color
with
some
sediment
floating
around
very
big
head
on
this
one
very
big
and
fluffy
looks
like
powdery
hills
of
golden
snow
highly
carbonated
has
a
somewhat
sour
smell
to
it
with
hints
of
candy
sugars
and
sweet
malts
tastes
very
well
balanced
and
sweet
different
than
any
other
barleywine
ive
ever
tasted
in
a
good
way
chewy
mouthfeel
very
good
drinkability
for
a
barleywine
sweet
vanilla
malts
and
intense
hop
flavor
are
mixed
to
perfection
so
integrated
they
just
flow
from
one
end
of
ther
spectrum
to
the
other
alcohol
is
notable
but
not
overboard
and
a
perfect
compliment
to
the
soft
sweet
malts
spicy
rye
comes
out
a
bit
as
it
warms
up
not
rough
but
certainly
big
unique
beer
that
lives
up
to
the
hype
for
me
hard
pour
results
in
one
finger
white
head
fairly
quick
dissipation
leaves
a
thin
film
of
head
on
top
of
body
light
amber
body
some
visible
carbonation
otherworldly
nose
a
bit
sweetish
caramel
molasses
a
bit
of
smoke
very
complex
hop
profile
not
too
bitter
more
floral
than
grassy
great
smelling
beer
taste
is
crazy
good
sweet
like
a
barleywine
brown
sugar
very
hoppy
in
a
good
balanced
way
fairly
dry
finish
should
pick
up
a
bit
more
character
after
aging
sticky
mouthfeel
good
effervescence
which
will
be
a
surprise
to
those
who
erroneously
believe
hotd
beers
are
undercarbonated
pretty
drinkable
for
this
abv
while
this
youngish
fred
lacks
the
character
of
older
batches
the
2
from
hannonts
fredfest
tasting
was
otherworldly
thanks
sean
this
is
imo
one
of
the
worlds
best
beers
my
personal
favorite
another
amazing
alan
sprints
offering
truly
exceptional
d
nice
smooth
flavorful
balanced
beer
but
it
is
a
slow
sipper
d
a
bit
of
a
sipper
i
have
trouble
figuring
this
beer
out
it
is
strong
but
not
overly
flavorful
it
seems
as
though
there
is
a
lot
going
on
but
it
keeps
it
under
wraps
i
only
got
one
bottle
last
trip
to
indiana
but
this
is
absolutly
a
beer
when
i
see
again
ill
pick
up
a
few
more
of
overall
very
different
good
but
definitely
a
sipper
the
mouthfeel
is
where
most
of
the
belgian
influence
seems
to
come
from
bottle
conditioned
to
a
high
carbonation
on
top
of
a
thick
malty
body
if
i
were
to
have
this
again
i
wouldnt
open
a
bottle
myself
this
beer
was
complex
and
interesting
but
not
very
drinkable
m
d
mouthfeel
is
full
big
yet
smooth
not
sticky
most
certainly
not
cloying
its
not
all
that
easy
to
take
such
a
big
brew
and
makes
it
something
wonderfully
drinkable
but
hair
of
the
dog
has
managed
it
just
fine
excellent
and
while
its
got
a
higher
price
tag
on
it
its
one
i
will
return
to
when
i
have
the
opportunity
a
sipper
for
sure
this
is
a
big
bold
beer
with
a
high
abv
definitely
not
bashful
insanely
complex
taboot
bottle
home
pours
a
big
coppery
amber
with
a
small
white
cap
it
looks
a
bit
like
brandy
lots
of
caramel
malt
sweetness
and
big
american
hops
in
the
aroma
theres
a
great
spicy
rye
note
in
the
flavor
along
with
honey
and
sweet
grapes
rich
but
not
cloying
theres
a
bitter
citrus
rind
finish
at
least
in
a
relatively
fresh
bottle
i
think
the
feel
improves
as
the
beer
sits
d
definitely
a
sipper
like
a
fine
port
recent
pick
up
from
a
cali
visit
pours
hazy
and
brownishorange
in
color
massive
massive
head
with
good
retention
and
a
ton
of
lacing
smell
was
sweet
with
lots
of
caramel
some
honey
sugar
and
alcohol
taste
was
pretty
similar
very
sweet
some
caramel
some
honey
candi
sugar
some
hops
and
spice
mouthfeel
was
thick
and
oily
a
little
chewy
overall
a
good
beer
but
it
didnt
blow
me
away
i
just
couldnt
get
over
the
sweetness
of
it
taste
is
really
great
for
such
a
young
barleywine
very
rich
and
complex
and
not
too
boozy
for
being
10
there
is
a
sharp
alochol
note
at
the
end
and
its
really
quite
hoppy
and
leaves
a
pretty
palate
wrenching
finish
thats
quite
sharp
taste
oh
yeah
buttery
start
with
malt
hoppy
finish
very
nice
drinkability
well
this
is
one
that
gets
its
drinkability
scored
as
a
sipper
both
with
10
and
the
complexity
of
this
beer
this
is
a
one
a
night
beer
but
it
is
definitely
one
i
kept
sipping
because
i
wanted
more
and
it
is
definitely
one
ill
be
having
again
indeed
im
tempted
to
lay
down
a
case
of
this
for
enjoyment
over
the
next
several
years
d
high
in
alc
this
beer
is
a
sipper
for
a
cold
winter
night
this
beer
is
very
good
and
deserves
to
have
the
status
it
has
ill
be
looking
for
this
one
again
d
a
sipper
but
not
as
boozy
as
the
abv
would
suggest
overall
very
nice
and
enjoyable
not
the
best
barleywine
ive
sampled
but
i
would
definitely
pick
this
up
again
this
is
a
big
beer
that
i
wouldnt
want
more
than
one
of
at
a
time
not
worth
the
big
price
that
comes
with
it
d
certainly
a
good
barleywine
i
particularly
like
the
candied
fruits
in
this
the
big
carbonation
was
easily
remedied
by
letting
it
mellow
for
a
bit
in
the
glass
this
could
age
easily
for
quite
some
time
after
my
horrible
experience
with
their
adam
beer
this
has
redeemed
by
frustrations
for
sure
this
is
good
but
definitely
a
sipper
d
easy
to
drink
considering
the
high
abv
i
would
be
interested
to
see
how
age
affects
this
brew
honestly
not
the
best
barleywine
ive
had
overall
a
very
complex
and
interesting
beer
i
would
love
to
try
a
bottle
thats
been
aged
for
several
years
d
the
10abv
was
pretty
well
mannered
with
only
a
gentle
and
appreciable
warming
that
never
discourages
musky
yeasty
quality
with
a
bready
palate
and
lingering
warmth
is
sure
to
offer
something
for
everyone
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
but
a
nightcapper
at
10
it
reminds
me
of
piraat
which
is
belgian
ipa
that
is
often
compared
to
american
style
barley
wines
i
looked
at
this
beer
too
many
times
on
the
shelf
i
finally
looked
it
up
on
beer
advocate
and
people
had
nothing
but
great
things
to
say
about
it
this
is
kind
of
an
odd
style
for
me
it
is
a
barely
wine
but
takes
of
the
character
of
an
imperial
golden
the
head
lasted
forever
and
it
made
my
apt
smell
like
a
field
of
flowers
after
15
minutes
or
so
i
could
finally
drink
the
beer
and
the
head
let
down
a
bit
amazing
beer
great
style
i
could
see
this
beer
really
holding
up
to
aging
well
hair
of
the
dog
mmmm
popped
the
cap
and
it
sounded
like
a
gunshot
as
the
cap
went
flying
off
poured
into
the
glass
and
instantly
filled
with
frothy
off
white
head
took
about
7
minutes
for
it
to
finally
settle
and
leave
an
incredibly
thick
and
creamy
two
finger
head
the
beer
itself
is
hazy
and
golden
in
color
with
visibly
high
carbonation
the
nose
is
sweet
and
biscuity
and
well
balanced
although
the
aroma
is
not
huge
and
bold
the
flavor
is
a
mix
of
grainy
and
biscuity
sweetness
floral
balancing
hops
and
a
vinous
quality
create
a
very
complex
but
smooth
taste
the
body
is
heavy
but
the
extremely
high
carbonation
makes
it
an
awkward
drink
this
brew
finishes
slow
with
all
the
complexity
flowing
to
the
end
mouthfeeldrinkability
a
pleasantly
full
mouthfeel
with
medium
to
low
carbonation
i
could
sip
on
this
for
hours
overall
a
great
beer
and
one
that
has
held
up
beautifully
id
say
it
has
improved
even
though
i
do
like
the
hop
profile
that
this
beer
starts
with
really
really
good
f
finishes
still
semi
sweet
somewhat
bitter
sticky
sweetness
and
syrupy
quality
lingers
a
hint
of
spiciness
and
warmth
of
the
booze
but
otherwise
hides
the
10
very
well
a
slight
lingering
toasted
malt
flavor
hints
in
the
background
under
the
lingering
syrupy
brown
sugar
molasses
maple
and
candi
sugar
very
welcoming
for
the
sweetness
roastedtoasted
malty
flavors
fruit
touch
of
bitterness
and
how
well
the
abv
is
hidden
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
it
reminded
me
a
lot
of
my
last
homebrew
barleywine
i
think
hotd
did
a
good
job
with
this
one
and
i
think
itll
be
even
better
with
a
couple
years
on
it
fred
is
another
amazing
offering
from
hotd
and
would
love
to
get
my
hands
on
some
more
and
give
it
some
age
to
see
how
it
does
with
some
time
on
its
side
the
only
thing
slowing
me
down
on
it
is
the
higher
abv
but
on
a
cold
winter
night
i
could
sip
my
way
through
a
couple
of
these
d
high
really
unique
really
interesting
worth
seeking
out
id
drink
it
again
in
a
heartbeat
my
second
favorite
bw
behind
lagunitas
gnarleywine
lots
to
like
about
this
brew
though
in
my
mind
it
lacks
a
little
of
the
beefy
complexity
of
the
gnarleywine
will
buy
again
if
i
can
find
it
in
my
area
d
very
drinkable
this
one
was
gone
in
no
time
loved
it
the
body
is
full
with
very
limited
carbonation
this
is
a
unique
beer
and
i
wouldnt
have
called
it
a
barleywine
but
that
is
kind
of
what
hotd
is
all
about
for
sure
could
age
and
hopefully
some
of
the
fusel
yeast
and
oxidation
notes
would
drop
out
d
overall
i
enjoyed
this
barleywine
quite
a
bit
while
a
small
alcohol
smelltaste
was
present
when
you
consider
that
it
is
10
abv
it
wasnt
as
bad
as
some
others
it
was
a
little
sweet
but
still
very
smooth
going
down
i
would
definitely
like
to
try
this
beer
again
im
not
a
big
fan
of
barleywines
but
this
one
was
very
nice
one
to
sip
and
savor
a
golden
to
amber
color
is
poured
in
the
glass
a
substantial
no
an
enormous
four
inch
head
forms
on
top
the
white
colored
head
dissolves
away
slowly
clinging
to
the
glass
it
seems
as
though
it
will
never
leave
a
citrus
lemon
fragrance
comes
out
at
the
front
of
the
aroma
a
bread
and
yeasty
fragrance
comes
through
and
grows
on
the
nose
after
each
scent
a
strong
malty
bread
and
yeasty
flavors
that
dominates
each
taste
it
finishes
with
a
mild
bitterness
bringing
the
flavors
of
grass
and
citrus
but
never
really
comes
out
strong
a
hearty
feel
a
heavymedium
body
ending
with
a
chewy
texture
and
finishing
with
medium
dryness
the
look
of
this
beer
was
a
bit
shocking
having
this
much
head
the
aroma
and
flavor
are
very
consistent
and
in
sync
with
each
other
the
hearty
and
strong
mouthfeel
make
this
a
solid
beer
it
is
pretty
drinkable
but
id
say
the
viscosity
and
stickiness
not
to
mention
abv
slow
me
down

pours
a
hazy

color
with
a
huge
frothy
offwhite
head
head
retention
and

are
both
very
good
the
head
was
so
big
i
had
to
let
the
beer
settle
in
the
glass
a
couple
times
before
i
was
able
to
pour
the
whole
beer
into
the
snifter
its
a

aroma
is
citrusy

orange

bready

apricots
earth
and

the
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
but
theres
also
some
spice
candy
sugar
and
a
little
bit
of
alcohol
noticable
too
mouthfeelbody
is
mediumfull
its
rich
and
creamy
with

soft

drinkability
is
good
the
soft
carbonation
makes
this
brew
easy
to
drink
i
think
this
is
a
good
beer
id
definitely
buy
this
again
the
next
time
i
can
find
it
dthis
is
quite
tasty
big
flavors
and
an
interesting
texture
the
alcohol
is
somewhat
present
but
at
10
it
isnt
bad
cheers
hotd
is
one
kickass
brewery
d
a
little
sweet
to
be
too
drinkable
but
definitely
good
for
a
10
barleywine
i
would
love
to
see
what
some
age
would
do
to
this
carbonated
enough
to
give
it
a
huge
head
the
huge
frothy
head
and
yeasty
flavors
make
this
one
a
sipper
for
sure
would
be
interested
to
see
what
this
one
tastes
like
with
a
few
years
on
it
but
only
having
one
of
these
on
hand
makes
that
part
difficult
to
manage
aging
this
was
my
first
beer
from
hair
of
the
dog
and
you
can
call
me
impressed
i
now
have
a
new
favorite
barleywine
overall
this
was
my
first
beer
from
hair
of
the
dog
and
i
have
been
singing
their
praises
ever
since
very
impressive
american
barleywine
with
a
lot
of
uniqueness
and
character
highly
recommended

really
a
tastey
one
hits
all
the
right
notes
a
little
on
the
boozy
side
but
i
kind
of
like
it
that
way
me
thinks
i
taste
heavy
maltsbready
with
hints
of
light
fruit
to
give
it
flavor
and
it
drinks
spicy
in
the
back
of
my
mouth
as
i
swallow
it
this
is
a
strong
beer
and
id
recommend
letting
it
sit
for
a
while
and
when
you
do
open
one
enjoy
each
sip
since
it
has
lots
of
promise
and
aging

a
delicious
and
enjoyable
barleywine
with
a

this
beer
improves
as
it
warms
and
is
a
wonderful
sipper
i
defiitely
need
to
track
down
some
more
hotd
offerings
try
this
brew
and
enjoy
it
for
what
it
is
like
most
of
the
hotd
beer
this
is
a
special
beer
having
more
than
one
just
somehow
feels
wrong
pair
this
up
with
the
strong
abv
and
it
boils
down
to
being
only
drinkable
up
to
one
or
two
bottles
still
its
a
great
brew
hey
the
head
is
there
there
superb
sipper
for
cold
weather
md
great
mouthfeel
on
this
one
fairly
thick
for
a
barleywine
with
ample
carbonation
that
accents
the
hoppiness
to
create
a
pleasantly
crisp
barleywine
this
thing
goes
down
super
smooth
i
wish
i
had
way
more
than
the
single
12oz
bottle
i
have
drinks
almost
as
easy
as
an
ipa
what
a
bizarre
offensive
beer
this
is
overall
i
was
a
bit
disappointed
in
the
fact
that
i
couldnt
even
pour
the
entire
beer
at
once
because
of
the
bottle
conditioning
i
wanted
to
leave
the
yeast
behind
but
with
multiple
tips
of
the
bottle
i
was
sure
to
stir
some
up
otherwise
an
excellent
and
complex
nicely
sipping
warming
ale
great
malt
and
citric
complexities
from
the
nose
to
the
mouth
drinkability
i
could
happily
drink
many
but
id
probably
pass
out
from
10
abv
its
initially
sweet
on
the
palate
honey
and
caramel
upfront
with
more
earthy
woody
drying
flavors
midpalate
the
body
has
held
up
quite
well
as
has
the
carbonation
im
amazed
at
how
gracefully
this
has
oxidized
taking
on
port
and
sherrylike
characteristics
without
developing
any
unpleasant
staleness
the
finish
is
bittersweet
flavors
of
toast
and
caramel
leading
into
a
woody
spicy
aftertaste
batch

this
poured
a
nearly
opaque
greenish
gold
with
tons
of
head
it
smelled
like
caramel
and
honey
and
creamy
yeast
with
sugary
oranges
and
light
copper
hops
it
tasted
like
sweet
caramel
and
toffee
and
honey
wheat
followed
by
strong
waxy
lemon
and
grapefruit
and
a
bit
of
sour
yeast
it
was
somewhat
thick
with
smooth
carbonation
and
had
a
lasting
bitter
aftertaste
with
alcohol
warming
overall
this
was
a
pretty
powerful
drink
with
unique
character
some
flavor
elements
were
good
but
others
were
not
and
they
generally
didnt
mesh
well
it
had
great
body
but
the
alcohol
was
harsh
so
this
was
not
easy
to
drink
splitting
a
12
ounce
bottle
was
plenty
for
me
i
would
imagine
this
improves
with
several
years
of
age
but
i
wasnt
a
huge
fan
of
it
at
whatever
age
this
bottle
was
d
very
drinkable
10
alcohol
is
well
masked
by
the
flavors
and
texture
a
interesting
beer
that
does
not
really
fit
into
a
style
a
meld
of
english
belgian
and
american
styles
and
ingredients
wish
i
had
more
than
this
one
bottle
cloudy
bronze
colored
with
a
massive
eggshell
head
that
takes
five
minutes
to
settle
enough
to
be
able
to
take
a
sip
and
leaves
splotchy
lace
behind
on
the
glass
the
nose
is
fresh
fruity
hops
and
gingerbread
spice
the
flavors
are
great
and
grow
more
complex
as
it
warms
imagine
a
belgian
quad
with
big
dank
hops
and
caramel
malt
a
full
bodied
beer
that
begs
to
be
sipped
slowly
and
enjoyed
im
glad
i
finally
got
my
hands
on
one
of
these
a
great
beer
that
lives
up
to
its
hype
pours
a
golden
orange
colored
body
with
a
small
white
head
diminishing
syrupy
aroma
sweet
like
something
strong
aroma
some
kind
of
syrup
smells
good
strong
taste
old
and
musty
tasting
syrupy
taste
like
maple
woody
taste
sweet
aftertaste
almost
cloying
very
tasty
doesnt
overwhelm
some
alcohol
bite
sticky
sweet
aftertaste
like
syrup
really
good
not
quite
a
sipping
beer
could
have
almost
a
whole
pint
without
overwhelming
hair
of
the
dogs
fred
is
a
strong
belgian
style
golden
ale
think
of
chimay
white
with
tons
more
complexity
and
notes
of
alcohol
in
the
finish
this
is
a
strong
beer
somewhat
sweet
but
typical
of
tripelstyle
brews
it
pours
yellowcopper
orange
in
a
goblet
and
has
a
medium
head
with
good
lacing
aromas
of
ripe
apples
and
sugar
are
appealing
tasty
but
a
powerful
somewhat
sweet
alcohol
finish
might
perturb
some
taste
buds
overall
a
well
made
brew
but
for
my
palate
not
a
home
run
medium
body
w
very
syrupy
feel
resinous
notes
in
the
finish
but
still
smooth
very
gentle
carbonation
helps
with
the
perception
of
smoothness
perhaps
the
most
pleasantly
surprising
aspect
of
the
beer
in
fact
support
the
craft
anytime
you
can
overall
sipper
sweet
tasty
slow
sipper
this
is
special
theres
really
very
little
notable
alcohol
flavors
coming
out
in
this
beer
but
it
is
still
quite
a
hefty
beer
the
sweetness
and
stickiness
bring
down
the
drinkability
a
bit
but
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
more
interesting
beers
ive
had
recently
d
very
drinkable
for
a
10
abv
the
perfect
nightcap
and
proof
positive
that
hotd
beer
ages
incredibly
well
what
a
treat
drinkability
is
good
i
wouldnt
recommend
dowing
these
but
a
definite
taster
that
is
well
worth
seeking
out
pours
a
slightly
glowing
but
cloudy
orange
color
with
a
creamy
offwhite
head
with
good
retention
and
thick
lacing
down
the
glass
the
aroma
has
caramel
citrus
hops
and
is
tangy
the
flavor
has
citrus
hops
malt
nuttiness
spices
toffee
and
finishes
with
a
soft
bitterness
its
a
creamy
fullbodied
beer
and
is
very
drinkable
very
unique
beer
overall
and
is
one
of
the
beer
that
really
made
me
want
to
get
closer
to
the
oregon
beer
scene
fred
from
the
wood
is
more
fragrant
but
this
is
easy
drinking
d
great
the
aroma
is
good
the
flavor
is
complex
with
exquisite
balance
and
the
mouthfeel
is
obscenely
velvety
the
appearance
is
the
only
aspect
of
this
beer
that
is
less
than
stellar
and
it
is
still
better
than
average
this
is
an
excellent
beer
and
my
only
complaint
is
that
i
dont
have
a
whole
case
of
them
to
cellar
because
it
has
the
potential
to
age
very
well
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
is
exceptional
little
hop
bitterness
and
masking
of
alcohol
make
this
a
fantastic
session
and
sipper
overall
im
slightly
ashamed
its
been
so
long
since
ive
had
this
brewer
and
shocked
its
my
first
review
of
theirs
ive
never
been
disappointed
and
ill
be
sure
to
buy
their
other
offerings
as
i
see
them
dmy
first
barleywine
i
like
it
and
now
understand
why
the
heavy
beers
predominate
the
ba
top
100
thick
malt
vinous
sourness
and
twang
of
hops
nice
balance
overall
i
could
see
this
one
blossoming
with
some
age
i
dislike
strong
hops
flavors
in
my
barleywines
the
hotness
really
needs
to
mellow
out
definitely
will
need
to
revisit
this
one
in
a
couple
years
there
is
a
bit
of
a
carbonation
sting
which
i
dont
care
for
along
with
a
noticeable
alcohol
burn
in
the
finish
but
this
beer
has
a
nice
body
i
enjoyed
drinking
it
for
sure
but
it
was
definitely
a
sipper
and
the
10
abv
made
itself
known
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
sugary
yeasty
bready
and
syrupy
although
the
abv
is
high
it
never
overwhelms
with
booze
and
is
very
easy
to
enjoy
im
not
sure
how
id
feel
after
a
few
glasses
but
enjoying
one
after
dinner
was
a
really
rewarding
experience
again

to

from
a
magnum
at
the
pdx
tasting
at
todds
hannonts
place
although
the
beer
had
to
be
close
to
15
years
old
it
was
still
incredibly
fresh
and
delicious
it
actually
seemed
a
bit
fresher
and
a
bit
less
mature
then
the
42
i
sampled
a
few
months
back
except
there
was
also
a
nuttiness
in
the
flavor
profile
that
i
didnt
recall
from
the
bottle
of
42
just
a
testament
to
the
ageability
of
this
great
beer
its
a
strong
beer
i
dont
know
if
i
would
drink
more
than
one
in
a
night
but
ill
certainly
drink
it
again
d
a
very
good
beer
definitely
a
sipper
considering
the
sweetness
the
comparatively
prominent
taste
of
alcohol
in
the
finish
and
the
smooth
mouthfeel
d
wow
this
was
an
incredible
brew
a
must
try
for
all
beer
fans
ive
had
some
hyped
beers
in
the
past
but
despite
all
the
praise
i
think
this
one
is
actually
underrated
ive
been
waiting
a
long
time
for
the
barleywine
that
topped
bigfoot
and
ive
finally
found
it
im
offically
a
hair
of
the
dog
fan
and
ive
got
adam
in
the
fridge
so
more
is
on
the
way
cant
recommend
this
one
highly
enough
try
it
now
bottle
from
jjpm74
thanks
this
barleywine
poured
a
deep
and
cloudy
orangey
brown
and
was
capped
with
a
thick
and
long
lasting
off
white
head
that
left
lots
of
sticky
lace
the
nose
was
candied
mangoes
heavy
brown
sugar
caramel
malts
some
fruit
a
bit
of
citrus
from
the
hops
some
dark
bread
crust
tasted
pretty
sweet
of
dark
fruits
candied
prunes
some
other
dried
fruit
caramel
malts
again
grapefruit
leads
to
a
cirtic
rind
pithiness
bitter
balances
the
very
sweet
molasses
like
malt
in
the
finish
a
pleasure
to
sip
thanks
john
i
have
trouble
distinguishing
the
hair
of
the
dog
styles
from
each
other
if
they
say
freds
a
barleywine
ill
take
their
word
for
it
its
a
little
more
like
an
old
ale
for
me
as
there
is
not
enough
hops
in
general
a
very
good
beer
and
among
a
great
selection
of
eclectic
brands
from
the
brewer
good
dark
rose
color
good
carbonation
and
a
very
good
flavor
and
mouthfeel
drinkability
notes
reminds
me
of
a
barley
wine
but
a
bit
stronger
the
alcohol
is
more
up
front
compared
to
a
bigfoot
taste
is
creamy
some
fruit
caramel
touch
of
citrus
and
a
bit
bitter
leaves
the
mouth
dry
and
sticky
great
job
hotd
really
looking
forward
to
my
bottle
of
adam
now
drinkability
this
brew
is
nicely
brewed
with
complex
yet
simple
flavor
profiles
i
would
not
hesitate
to
have
another
but
just
one
other
d
im
not
digging
this
one
nearly
as
much
as
adam
or
matt
kind
of
staring
at
the
glass
and
wondering
how
im
going
to
finish
it
the
abv
isnt
harsh
but
its
not
wellhidden
either
and
the
aftertaste
is
offputting
definitely
something
id
only
want
a
4oz
pour
of
in
the
future
and
my
least
favorite
hotd
to
date
d
i
took
my
time
with
this
one
and
enjoyed
it
very
much
a
smooth
sipper
that
demands
time
be
put
into
drinking
it
i
would
not
have
it
any
other
way
now
i
need
to
try
some
others
from
this
brewery
my
first
beer
from
hotd
and
i
was
anxious
to
try
this
so
after
it
settled
for
a
few
days
in
the
fridge
i
got
right
to
it
golden
amber
liquid
billowed
into
the
glass
with
a
fine
amount
of
head
retention
my
nose
was
met
with
rye
and
an
abundance
of
alcohol
almost
medicinal
other
aromas
as
it
warmed
include
plum
and
a
fair
amount
of
hops
alcohol
is
very
in
your
face
in
the
taste
it
has
some
heat
i
would
really
like
to
have
an
aged
one
rye
and
caramel
malt
follow
up
abv
and
has
some
cloying
sweetness
to
it
some
hop
and
alcohol
linger
inside
the
mouth
i
liked
it
and
was
grateful
they
thought
about
bringing
me
beer
but
it
didnt
really
speak
to
my
tastebuds
batch
74
pours
amber
very
small
head
that
dissipated
quickly
but
leaves
some
lacing
you
can
tell
how
thick
this
beer
is
because
its
not
very
dark
yet
barely
translucent
smell
is
phenomenal
tons
of
tropical
fruitness
imparted
by
the
hops
i
perceive
pinapple
and
apricot
to
be
the
dominant
fruits
but
kiwi
mandarin
orange
strawberry
come
to
mind
they
all
merge
together
with
the
powerful
malt
sweetness
you
can
smell
the
belgian
candy
sugar
this
merge
or
more
like
a
marriage
is
even
more
apparent
in
the
taste
the
tropical
fruity
yet
not
citrusy
hop
profile
is
about
as
complex
as
ive
ever
tasted
if
i
remember
the
label
used
to
say
that
10
hop
varieties
were
used
it
no
longer
does
say
that
which
probably
implies
that
they
slimmed
down
the
bill
a
bit
but
with
no
loss
for
sure
its
damn
complex
dont
mistake
though
this
is
not
a
hop
monster
american
barleywine
malt
sweetness
plays
just
as
big
a
role
in
this
masterpiece
the
only
and
i
mean
only
thing
keeping
me
from
giving
it
a
5
is
that
some
alcohol
flavor
brings
up
the
rear
not
harsh
not
strong
but
something
i
consider
a
slight
flaw
nonetheless
a
year
or
two
in
the
cellar
would
doubtless
get
rid
of
that
but
with
what
loss
to
the
awesome
hop
profile
huge
mouthfeel
not
as
big
as
the
bigger
imperial
stouts
but
big
lower
carbonation
decadent
it
took
quite
a
while
to
finish
the
12
oz
but
more
because
i
wanted
to
savor
it
than
because
it
is
hard
to
drink
one
of
my
favorite
beers
of
all
time
another
high
quality
beer
from
imo
one
of
the
best
breweries
around
highly
recommended
hair
of
the
dog
fred
is
a
slightly
hazy
and
incredibly
sparkling
amber
ale
with
a
thick
resilient
offwhite
head
it
has
a
strong
sweet
malty
aroma
with
notes
of
tropical
fruit
maybe
passion
fruit
its
mediumfull
bodied
and
fluffy
it
leaves
the
tongue
sticky
its
very
full
flavored
its
slightly
sweet
quite
phenolic
and
very
complex
with
notes
of
chocolate
caramel
leather
and
whiskey
its
pretty
shocking
actually
this
is
good
stuff
but
finishing
a
twelveounce
bottle
is
kind
of
a
challenge
absolutely
drinkable
but
very
sweet
and
strong
like
a
triple
malt
bomb
ipa
with
candy
drinkability
a
barleywine
or
a
belgian
strong
pale
it
seems
to
walk
the
line
between
both
but
if
i
had
to
designate
it
one
or
the
other
without
knowing
what
it
was
it
would
be
a
bsp
very
good
though
and
a
brew
im
glad
i
tried
from
a
brewery
that
id
never
had
anything
by
id
easily
grab
some
other
hair
of
the
dog
brews
in
the
future
though
if
i
can
find
them
batch
80after
drinking
a
horribly
flat
adam
the
other
night
i
am
nothing
short
of
astounded
to
see
the
glass
with
a
gentle
pour
fill
with
foam
which
took
nearly
20
mins
or
so
to
settle
down
wtf
is
the
issue
with
carbonation
up
there
tasty
though
i
give
it
a
solid
a
great
brew
anothere
home
run
for
hotd
lets
pretend
that
ruth
doesnt
exist
and
stick
to
making
some
of
the
best
strong
ales
in
america
as
of
right
now
this
is
a
top
25
beer
for
me
i
can
only
imagine
what
fred
from
the
wood
is
going
to
be
like
d
i
hate
to
admit
i
would
have
several
mfd
very
low
carbonation
with
a
rich
slick
mouthfeel
almost
syrupy
a
little
hot
but
thats
to
be
expected
although
a
very
pleasing
and
complex
brew
i
was
content
with
my
6oz
pour
definitely
not
something
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
my
nonic
pint
glass
appears
a
hazed
golden
apricot
color
with
a
finger
of
bone
white
head
nose
and
flavor
are
of
sweet
honey
golden
toasted
grain
caramelized
malt
a
nice
hit
of
alcohol
some
light
vanilla
notes
and
a
bit
fruity
rich
and
satisfying
body
with
almost
the
perfect
amount
of
carbonation
to
put
the
aromas
and
flavors
in
balance
tasty
stuff
this
paired
very
well
with
some
super
sharp
aged
cheddar
d
this
is
good
but
nothing
about
it
blew
me
away
i
prefer
its
from
the
wood
incarnation
by
far
batch
71
d
i
like
it
a
lot
i
would
have
as
many
of
these
as
i
could
i
do
love
barelywine
even
those
this
isnt
one
10
abv
can
be
tasted
but
doesnt
overpower
and
the
honey
perfectly
balances
it
out
mouthfeel
is
effervescently
creamy
if
that
mikes
sense
soft
but
persistent
carbonation
and
a
medium
mouthfeel
with
a
head
that
never
goes
away
d
a
very
good
beer
i
will
soon
be
seeking
out
more
of
this
for
aging
dthe
abv
in
this
beer
is
hidden
so
well
that
i
could
see
myself
drinking
a
couple
of
these
rather
fast
and
catching
a
nice
buzz
not
the
point
for
these
beers
but
when
they
are
drinkable
they
are
drinkable
d
probably
my
least
favorite
hotd
beer
so
far
and
it
wasnt
bad
by
any
means
just
didnt
blow
me
away
like
their
other
beers
so
far
a
really
tasty
beer
over
all
very
tasty
i
poured
the
beer
the
hair
of
the
dog
fred
very
nice
deep
goldenamber
color
with
a
pretty
sweet
head
nice
residual
ring
left
behind
thick
with
head
left
sticking
to
the
side
of
the
glass
from
point
of
complete
pour
to
level
of
drinking
smell
was
dead
on
comparable
to
an
abbey
very
nice
taste
aftertaste
and
mid
range
flavor
mid
gave
the
hint
of
hops
complex
hops
forward
taste
like
an
abbey
ale
and
the
finish
flowed
right
through
with
a
yeasty
malty
ending
and
hops
mouthfeel
was
almost
full
with
the
complex
tastes
something
dies
out
quickly
i
couldnt
put
my
finger
on
thick
and
stroung
not
that
easy
to
drink
but
a
fantastic
sippable
brew
i
drank
it
out
of
a
wine
glass
d
as
a
lover
of
barleywines
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
beer
a
sipper
for
sure
but
thats
apt
when
all
that
alcohol
is
masked
so
dubiously
enjoyed
over
a
45
min
period
as
it
opened
up
and
warmed
recommended
this
one
is
a
very
slow
sipper
im
not
sure
as
to
when
batch
72
was
created
but
im
assuming
it
would
probably
mellow
out
a
bit
with
some
more
age
on
it
a
good
beer
though
with
a
lot
of
complexity
i
have
never
had
a
golden
barley
wine
before
if
i
didnt
know
it
was
a
barleywine
i
would
have
said
it
was
a
strong
belgian
pale
but
this
has
more
of
a
kick
than
that
like
the
dubious
descriptors
the
brewery
uses
to
describe
the
ale
true
wise
buoyant
joyful
i
have
a
bit
of
trouble
making
sense
of
this
beer
i
also
find
warming
has
brought
out
disproportionately
more
alcohol
than
it
has
nuance
its
beginning
to
resemble
homebrew
in
more
ways
than
one
that
being
said
fred
is
a
tasty
treat
of
a
beer
whatever
the
style
overall
this
certainly
is
a
special
golden
ale
a
weak
saison
meets
bspa
meets
belgian
ipa
definitely
worth
a
shot
pours
a
ohsoslightly
fogged
orange
brown
with
a
thin
creme
head
nose
is
sticky
apple
syrup
wooded
alcohol
tones
are
there
as
well
flavor
is
maple
syrup
with
a
slight
alcohol
burn
that
i
actually
enjoy
fruit
mixed
in
there
seems
like
apples
feel
is
slick
on
liquid
carbonation
is
low
this
is
an
excellent
beer
i
mean
really
outstanding
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
without
a
problem
over
the
course
of
a
night
d
highly
drinkable
which
is
a
bit
scarey
considering
the
alc
content
taste
is
floral
perfumy
hops
somewhat
bitter
very
full
and
filling
on
the
mouthfeel
you
only
get
the
slightest
hint
of
alcohol
in
the
taste
almost
has
a
acidic
grapefruit
taste
to
it
d
interesting
as
it
was
in
this
lessthanperfect
state
i
wouldnt
have
it
again
and
will
definitely
edit
this
when
i
get
a
good
one
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
dark
amber
with
a
huge
bubbly
head
that
lasts
forever
and
leaves
thick
gobs
of
lacing
all
the
way
down
smells
of
citrus
caramel
and
a
bit
of
spicy
yeast
taste
is
caramel
malt
grassy
citrus
hops
fruity
esters
mixed
with
a
bit
of
alcohol
has
a
bit
of
a
belgian
flair
to
it
really
interesting
and
flavorful
thick
body
lots
of
carbonation
sticky
sweet
mouthfeel
i
thought
this
one
was
great
i
wish
i
had
more
drinkability
the
alcohol
really
hits
you
hard
it
is
somewhat
refreshing
but
heavy
at
the
same
time
not
sure
what
to
think
of
that
combo
simply
complex
this
is
a
very
good
barleywine
with
an
interesting
hop
profile
on
top
of
a
musty
sweetness
with
plenty
of
alcohol
burn
good
but
not
great
for
me
nice
but
1
is
enough
for
me
in
one
night
d
this
is
a
pretty
big
beer
very
interesting
though
this
bottle
has
been
cellared
for
a
bit
not
positive
how
long
and
i
think
the
hops
have
faded
especially
in
the
smell
but
taste
wise
its
still
bold
and
flavorful
i
love
the
rye
in
particular
it
doesnt
seem
like
its
10
at
all
and
that
makes
it
quite
drinkable
good
stuff
d
this
is
about
as
complex
as
you
can
get
with
an
american
barleywine
fred
boasts
a
very
broad
palate
of
flavors
a
robust
malty
character
and
plenty
of
hop
bitterness
while
maintaining
his
drinkability
not
something
i
would
drink
again
this
beer
pours
a
dark
amber
with
a
1
fingered
head
and
not
much
lacing
to
note
the
smell
is
big
of
alcohol
and
raisins
the
flavor
has
a
big
malt
base
with
some
raisin
flavors
and
hints
of
vanilla
the
mouthfeel
has
a
big
dry
aftertaste
which
makes
the
drinkability
tough
for
this
brew
d
delicious
im
up
in
the
air
on
whether
or
not
this
is
an
american
barleywine
but
the
complexity
of
malt
hop
and
yeast
flavors
is
really
a
treat
for
the
palette
bready
malts
pair
with
spices
and
lots
of
fruit
from
the
hops
and
yeast
to
make
an
excellent
beer
well
done
hair
of
the
dog
drinkability
too
hot
to
handle
had
a
tough
time
finishing
this
one
but
maybe
im
just
not
used
to
barleywines
then
again
maybe
this
one
is
spoiled
i
dont
know
but
this
was
a
very
tough
drink
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
and
this
is
one
hell
of
a
barley
wine
i
strongly
recommend
it
you
can
taste
the
candied
sugar
10
hops
provide
a
slight
aftertaste
of
bitter
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
except
a
slight
warming
in
my
stomach
reminding
me
this
one
is
10
medium
bodied
smooth
and
quite
drinkable
well
i
was
expecting
mindblowing
fred
while
appropriately
bizarre
just
didnt
turn
my
crank
not
bad
something
im
very
happy
to
have
tried
but
i
doubt
id
reach
for
another
d
this
is
bold
and
burly
i
am
gonna
try
this
one
again
sometime
soon
i
checked
their
website
for
info
on
the
vintage
dating
and
i
am
at
a
loss
i
also
checked
to
make
sure
i
am
reviewing
the
correct
fred
not
fred
from
the
wood
i
have
it
right
but
my
label
is
more
similar
to
fred
from
the
wood
versus
traditional
fred
golden
special
ale
which
i
have
maybe
a
few
bottles
missed
the
mark
as
far
as
bottling
is
concerned
in
any
event
this
beer
still
knocked
my
socks
off
and
it
must
be
sampled
incredible
stuff
creamy
buttery
caramel
mild
sherry
toffee
buckwheat
honey
magnificent
palate

i
did
my
best
to
average
the
ratings
for
this
one
dfeels
overall
rough
around
the
edges
i
bet
this
will
be
fantastic
with
a
little
bit
of
age
poured
with
an
enormous
head
huge
it
was
a
kind
of
pale
yellowgoldenamber
not
really
pale
but
sort
of
pale
for
a
barleywine
the
smell
is
good
a
bit
of
sweet
alcohol
some
hops
and
a
bit
of
an
estery
smell
maybe
even
some
fusel
smells
the
taste
is
very
interesting
some
fruity
sweetness
peachy
alcohol
with
a
bit
of
the
burn
somewhat
estery
a
bit
of
bitterness
though
not
a
lot
of
hop
flavor
i
like
it
the
mouthfeel
is
very
nice
theres
a
lot
to
seek
out
in
this
beer
the
hoppiness
the
sweet
malts
the
alcohol
and
a
rush
of
carbonation
to
deliver
it
this
will
catch
you
and
i
would
drink
it
again
if
i
could
find
it
drinkability
is
good
but
i
wouldnt
suggest
more
than
one
or
two
in
a
night
because
the
aftertaste
that
lingers
on
the
palate
may
be
a
little
to
sweet
and
rich
if
this
aftertaste
werent
so
pronounced
i
would
definitely
make
a
night
of
this
ale
awesome
almost
burgandy
colored
pour
with
a
surprisingly
large
head
flavor
is
full
of
sugar
and
fruit
and
a
little
bit
of
caramel
lurking
behind
the
alcohol
flavor
is
present
but
isnt
invasive
at
all
one
of
the
best
barleywines
that
ive
ever
had
d
like
everything
from
this
brewery
it
is
wonderful
get
it
because
it
is
fantastic
probably
the
most
drinkable
thanks
again
to
travisd13
for
making
this
beer
available
to
me
good
stuff
magnum
from
batch
57
a
huge
beer
in
more
ways
than
one
cloudy
light
brown
pour
with
sediment
squatty
head
that
turns
into
a
ring
with
good
lacing
hearty
aroma
of
malt
tobacco
toffee
slight
citrus
with
hops
and
alcohol
robust
taste
that
immediately
warms
the
stomach
resiny
goodness
with
malt
and
earthiness
mix
throughout
with
hops
wood
and
vanilla
loved
this
one
scott
pours
a
cloudy
amber
color
with
a
nice
sized
white
head
aroma
is
dominated
by
the
strength
of
alcohol
also
contains
hints
of
spices
and
white
fruits
taste
is
very
similar
to
the
aroma
in
which
the
10
abv
is
not
masked
very
well
at
all
tastes
of
strong
alcohol
that
is
slightly
balanced
with
golden
apple
and
spices
the
alcohol
taste
becomes
less
overbearing
as
it
warms
rides
the
line
between
dipa
and
barleywine
and
does
it
quite
nicely
recommended
for
sure
batch
69
its
a
bit
young
pours
a
clear
slightly
pale
copper
with
lasting
white
head
and
decent
lacing
the
aroma
has
a
punch
of
hoppiness
that
is
all
over
the
place
with
spice
citrus
and
pine
hop
notes
the
hoppiness
is
quickly
dampened
by
a
nice
nose
of
caramel
dark
fruity
esters
and
alcohol
phenols
the
taste
starts
with
a
cherry
bite
aided
by
the
carbonation
followed
by
muted
hop
notes
of
pine
and
spice
before
the
initial
hop
notes
let
go
a
creamy
sweet
caramel
maltiness
surfaces
along
with
toffee
a
rye
twang
mild
of
dark
fruity
esters
and
a
hint
of
biscuit
the
hops
retake
control
of
the
flavor
with
a
moderate
bitter
assault
that
continues
to
the
finish
it
ends
with
hop
bitterness
sweet
caramel
maltiness
and
an
alcohol
tingling
sensation
a
year
or
two
more
would

drinkability
not
sure
what
i
was
expecting
with
this
one
but
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
an
incredibly
flavorful
and
complex
beer
with
well
hidden
alcohol
this
ones
fierce
without
looking
fierce
has
everything
youd
want
too
dark
malts
light
malts
dark
fruits
light

hop
notes
hop
bitterness
and
only
faint
etoh
kisses
recommended
notes
this
is
an
awful
lot
different
than
fred
from
the
wood
if
i
had
them
both
back
to
back
id
be
hard
pressed
recognizing
that
this
was
the
base
d
i
would
like
to
have
another
one
two
finger
white
head
amber
in
color
dark
yeast
expelled
from
the
bottle
multiple
washes
and
it
was
still
coming
out
sweet
malt
with
a
little
yeast
and
alcohol
on
the
nose
after
popping
the
cap
glass
is
even
more
pronounced
even
more
alcohol
on
the
palette
whoa
this
is
hot
no
attempts
to
hide
the
alcohol
on
this
one
getting
some
hops
in
the
nose
the
more
i
get
into
it
head
retention
is
good
clean
lacing
that
lasts
with
the
swigs
not
a
whole
lot
of
sponging
not
horrible
but
really
hot
and
that
leads
me
to
thinking
the
balance
is
off
maybe
this
one
was
conditioned
too
long
overall
this
was
a
pretty
good
beer
not
something
i
want
to
drink
on
a
regular
basis
but
definately
good
tastes
of
rich
caramels
oranges
light
hop
bitterness
taht
adds
a
ciderlike
spiciness
fred
plays
a
delicate
balance
between
malts
and
hops
exceptionally
well
balanced
nice
long
finish
touch
of
warmness
in
the
throat
many
times
american
barleywines
are
a
little
too
hot
a
little
too
hoppy
to
allow
the
malts
to
come
through
but
fred
is
truly
a
barleyflavored
barleywine
sometimes
gets
a
little
too
sweet
but
nonetheless
a
fantastic
beer
d
very
sweet
and
quite
rich
for
what
it
is
i
will
say
it
is
quite
drinkable
though
d
so
sweet
that
12
ounces
was
enough
i
could
keep
drinking
this
but
i
think
ill
switch
to
something
drier
bright
slightly
cloudy
orange
in
color
with
a
huge
creamy
and
fluffy
head
that
does
not
quit
very
hoppy
aromahas
a
big
fresh
mowed
grass
smell
to
it
huge
hop
flavor
dominatesalmost
to
an
astringent
degree
very
puckering
and
almost
sour
needs
a
lot
more
malt
to
balance
the
hops
i
realize
this
is
a
us
version
but
it
still
needs
some
more
malt
please
ok
mouthfeel
lacks
even
the
oily
slickness
of
a
lot
of
hops
as
much
as
i
love
us
barleywines
this
one
just
doesnt
do
it
for
me
way
overhoppedeven
for
a
us
imperial
i
find
it
overhopped
not
my
thing
in
the
mouth
it
was
silky
smooth
and
leaves
quite
a
mark
on
the
tongue
and
roof
of
the
mouth
it
was
well
carbonated
i
found
it
to
be
a
good
barleywine
fairly
drinkable
nice
beer
d
although
these
were
very
expensive
beers
4
for
a
12oz
retail
they
are
well
worth
it
as
they
are
so
tasty
a
relatively
easy
drinker
i
wouldnt
say
its
my
favorite
beer
in
the
world
but
i
wouldnt
pass
it
up
if
i
had
the
chance
to
drink
it
again
pours
a
cloudy
blood
orange
color
with
an
average
white
head
that
settled
into
a
ring
around
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
honey
floral
sugary
sweet
and
a
muted
hop
presence
the
taste
is
sugary
sweet
honeybready
malt
some
grapewine
like
flavors
and
grassy
hops
the
belgian
candi
sugar
dominates
with
the
rye
malt
giving
a
slight
spiciness
and
the
pnw
hops
seem
to
trickle
in
at
the
end
the
feel
is
heavy
slick
and
sticky
some
boozeahol
burn
in
the
nose
a
tasty
beer
for
sure
but
a
bit
sugary
and
sticky
some
belgian
yeast
would
have
worked
nicely
with
this
brew

obviously
im
a
fan
of
aging
this
beer
i
think
i
may
have
purchased
fred
in
park
city
or
from
plumb
jack
in
san
francisco
during
visits
in
the
spring
of
2003
overall
hotd
fred
is
an
interesting
brew
that
is
worth
a
try
i
would
love
to
get
a
couple
of
these
bottles
for
aging
recommended
definitely
a
sipper
rolls
heavy
but
wicked
enjoyable
thanks
again
bill
d
very
unique
for
a
barleywine
not
used
to
having
this
much
hop
flavor
but
it
certainly
wouldnt
qualify
as
a
iipa
my
only
real
complaint
is
that
its
just
too
harsh
the
hops
are
harsh
the
alcohol
is
harsh
and
even
the
sweetness
is
a
bit
harsh
i
would
definitely
recommend
letting
this
one
sit
for
a
while
as
i
think
that
would
improve
the
drinkability
greatly
despite
that
it
wasnt
a
particularly
hard
to
drink
beer
although
one
12oz
bottle
is
more
than
enough
for
one
sitting
would
recommend
giving
this
one
a
try
for
sure
this
seems
like
a
belgianish
take
on
the
barleywine
style
ive
never
had
a
beer
quite
like
it
before
not
really
drinkable
in
a
sessionable
sense
but
it
works
well
as
a
nightcap
ill
be
purchasing
this
in
the
future
thanks
again
bro
i
almost
dont
want
to
submit
this
rating
sorry
d
i
enjoyed
this
quite
a
bit
but
i
wouldnt
call
it
a
barleywine
i
rated
this
as
a
beer
that
does
not
fit
into
any
category
i
have
wanted
to
try
hair
of
the
dogs
beer
for
a
while
this
brew
pours
a
nice
copper
brown
and
has
a
silky
tan
head
excellent
lacing
the
nose
is
quite
sweet
yet
well
balanced
with
floral
hops
and
spicy
belgian
yeasts
the
taste
has
tropical
fruits
candy
malts
sweet
complex
alcohols
with
a
constant
fruity
hop
presence
delicious
the
full
body
passes
like
silk
over
the
palate
nice
blend
of
a
belgian
strong
ale
and
a
barleywine
my
first
hotd
and
while
it
didnt
blow
me
away
id
like
to
try
some
more
offerings
its
an
iconic
beer
and
unlike
too
many
it
lives
well
up
to
its
status
it
has
a
comfy
homey
character
the
brings
a
happy
atmosphere
to
bear
the
abv
is
doubledigit
and
a
caution
but
its
incorporated
and
blended
like
everything
else
and
worth
the
eventual
tilt
thanks
fred
for
being
worth
the
wait
and
the
time
poured
after
a
tough
day
on
the
trail
wow
is
a
yummy
beer
melts
in
your
mouth
and
brain
lots
of
sweetness
alcohol
is
pretty
well
hidden
good
lacing
can
tell
the
candy
sugar
is
in
there
is
a
very
nice
beer
that
is
just
damn
enjoyable
would
love
to
try
the
wood
aged
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
chewy
the
last
swallow
has
that
tasty
sediment
grit
damn
this
is
good
must
get
more
this
is
actually
one
of
the
more
drinkable
barleywines
ive
had
in
fact
it
might
be
the
most
drinkable
barleywines
that
ive
had
ive
been
repeatedly
amazed
by
hair
of
the
dog
recently
pretty
impressive
although
i
prefer
doggie
claws
or
adam
d
easy
to
drink
nice
and
tasty
d
loved
it
would
love
to
have
it
again
worth
a
shot
drinkability
is
moderate
nice
flavors
and
incredible
mouthfeel
alcohol
is
on
the
high
side
though
easy
to
consume
but
in
limited
quantities
mouthfeel
is
a
little
oily
but
the
hops
tend
to
dry
that
out
pretty
quickly
im
a
big
guy
that
can
session
almost
anything
and
this
is
no
different
i
couldnt
believe
how
fast
i
put
this
away
incredible
stuff
from
our
friends
on
the
west
coast
notes
i
will
have
this
again
and
cellar
a
few
at
five
dollars
for
12oz
this
is
a
special
treat
and
not
something
for
sessions
easy
enough
to
drinkor
just
sip
a
friendly
beer
fred
wont
go
on
my
alltime
greatest
hits
list
but
id
surely
drink
it
should
we
happen
to
meet
again
d
a
good
tasting
beer
high
on
the
hops
the
bottle
conditioning
may
not
have
been
right
as
the
carbonation
seemed
to
be
a
factor
but
id
recomend
it
ok
hype
you
win
this
time
fred
rocks
highly
recommended
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
creamy
a
nice
sipper
that
is
best
served
at
cellar
temperature
d
drinks
like
an
excellant
barleywine
or
after
dinner
drink
i
could
probably
only
drink
one
maybe
2
but
would
savor
each
swallow
d
not
incredibly
drinkable
for
a
gonnlen
ale
probably
a
side
effect
of
the
raised
alcol
level
pours
a
cloudy
dim
peach
color
with
limited
stark
white
head
the
nose
is
interesting
with
good
hops
and
some
fruit
slight
alcohol
taste
is
quite
exceptional
with
good
dark
and
light
almost
tropical
fruit
flavors
some
solid
malt
presence
and
a
great
sweetness
hops
are
very
present
on
the
finish
and
some
alcohol
almost
a
candy
sweetness
remains
on
the
lips
a
very
floral
fruit
flavor
in
here
is
quite
unique
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
but
still
quite
good
drinkabliity
is
ok
now
but
is
a
wee
bit
hot
i
think
this
one
will
tame
into
a
wonderful
wonderful
beer
with
a
couple
years
in
the
cellar
lucky
thing
i
have
an
extra
haha
but
i
will
defenitely
trade
for
this
again
great
brew
unique
brew
fun
brew
and
that
is
what
its
all
about
drinkability
12oz
of
this
is
too
much
for
me
and
i
find
it
nearly
impossible
to
get
through
a
bottle
i
do
however
can
imagine
it
being
nice
in
4oz
samples
every
onceinawhile
fred
is
a
damn
impressive
beer
im
not
sure
if
its
a
golden
strong
ale
as
advertised
or
an
american
barleywine
as
listed
all
i
know
is
thats
very
tasty
and
id
like
more
perhaps
one
day
ohio
will
be
a
home
to
this
gem
of
a
beer
thanks
again
genog
this
made
my
night
hv
a
great
sipper
and
a
fantastic
dessert
i
enjoyed
it
over
an
hour
or
so
and
it
kept
getting
better
i
tried
a
fresh
version
recently
and
it
had
a
much
stronger
hop
character
and
quite
a
bit
more
carbonation
i
like
it
better
with
the
age
on
it
hooray
for
fred
bottle
shared
at
tasting
i
believe
humulonered
brought
this
and
thanks
pours
a
medium
caramel
color
smell
is
lightly
malty
and
bright
and
light
with
a
hint
of
alcohol
taste
is
almost
oaky
perhaps
from
the
oxidation
of
this
older
bottle
moderate
maltiness
aside
from
that
and
a
pleasant
alcohol
character
lightly
drying
at
the
end
as
well
nice
beer
that
ill
have
to
have
again
at
some
point
overall
delicious
complex
tangy
orangey
sweetness
fun
and
interesting
and
tasty
not
super
easy
to
drink
but
i
love
the
stuff
lives
up
to
the
hype
if
not
the
price
but
close
d
pretty
solid
great
barleywine
batch
70
pours
a
hazy
peach
to
copper
color
a
fairly
large
off
white
head
builds
and
very
slowly
recedes
clinging
to
the
glass
aroma
is
some
large
citrus
and
tropical
fruit
notes
sweet
citrusy
grapefruit
and
mango
rye
notes
are
also
very
evident
in
the
aroma
as
well
as
some
grassy
hoppiness
taste
follows
the
aroma
with
strong
citrus
flavors
oranges
grapefruit
as
well
as
some
nice
tropical
fruit
flavor
and
a
good
rye
zing
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
full
in
body
but
still
very
refreshing
creamy
but
not
overly
thick
hop
and
rye
malts
create
a
peppery
tingle
on
the
tongue
and
a
bite
at
the
back
of
throat
in
the
finish
along
with
a
warmth
of
alcohol
amazing
beer
really
the
flavors
and
feel
blend
together
perfectly
unique
big
yet
refreshing
i
need
a
case
d
wow
a
phenomenal
offering
and
im
glad
to
say
ive
tried
it
i
will
keep
my
eyes
open
for
more
bottles
to
hide
away
this
beer
is
definately
an
afterdinner
treat
i
would
think
it
would
be
great
in
the
cool
fall
or
chilly
winter
months
as
it
really
warms
you
as
you
enjoy
thanks
go
out
to
grumpy
for
the
opportunity
to
sample
this
one
bought
at
south
bay
liquor
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
looks
like
a
belgian
beer
but
lacks
a
big
head
aroma
of
pineapple
and
bubble
gum
holy
shit
that
smells
delicious
taste
is
fruity
with
big
bitterness
coming
in
on
the
finish
very
tasty
definitely
reminds
me
of
the
stone
10th
anniversary
ale
which
ive
only
had
once
cant
remember
what
the
mouthfeel
was
unfortunately
i
truly
loved
this
beer
d
definitely
my
favorite
hair
of
the
dog
beer
yet
i
honestly
didnt
dig
adam
or
rose
whatsoever
but
this
one
really
came
together
well
i
wouldnt
categorize
it
as
american
barleywine
but
then
again
none
of
the
hair
of
the
dog
beers
ive
had
so
far
really
fit
in
to
the
commonly
accepted
categories
they
are
placed
in
and
i
commend
the
brewer
on
that
this
beer
is
smooth
and
sweet
perfect
level
of
carbonation
to
power
through
the
substantial
body
the
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
encourages
you
to
take
the
next
sip
to
get
that
nice
sweetness
back
consumed
on
11092009
with
largadeer
and
poured
into
a
snifter
looking
at
my
prior
review
im
rather
embarrassed
at
how
bad
it
is
i
really
dont
feel
like
writing
a
full
review
at
this
time
so
brief
notes
will
have
to
suffice
the
beer
opened
with
a
light
pop
despite
being
nearly
13
years
old
this
barleywine
has
aged
gracefully
the
hops
have
essentially
disappeared
leaving
rich
caramel
and
toffee
as
well
as
complimentary
oxidation
this
is
the
oldest
barleywine
that
ive
had
and
i
cant
believe
how
well
it
held
up
layers
and
layers
of
caramel
and
toffee
delicious
overall
my
first
hod
brew
and
it
is
wonderful
this
one
is
not
fresh
nor
would
i
call
it
vintage
it
is
a
wonderful
drinking
brew
that
is
as
smooth
as
you
will
find
when
it
comes
to
a
barleywine
southbay
just
got
some
fresh
hod
in
hopefully
i
can
score
some
because
this
little
guy
can
brew
there
is
no
doubt
about
it
drinkability
is
moderate
relatively
high
for
a
barleywine
the
10
is
wellmasked
behind
the
wide
ranging
taste
profile
this
is
a
unique
bwine
that
i
would
love
to
try
with
some
aging
as
well
as
on
draft
poured
from
12oz
bottle
into
new
belgium
snifter
batch
70
poured
a
golden
orangish
color
with
off
white
color
head
that
disappeared
after
a
minute
leaving
some
lacing
smell
is
a
sweet
honey
malt
aroma
with
dried
apricot
and
alcohol
taste
has
a
sweet
malty
backbone
with
a
grapefruit
light
rye
and
alcohol
flavor
mouthfeel
is
sticky
sweet
but
a
nice
balance
to
the
hops
that
help
keep
it
from
being
cloy
the
low
carbonation
keeps
it
creamy
i
like
hodt
i
like
fred
while
not
a
session
beer
an
easy
to
drink
strong
ale
d
this
actually
warmed
me
like
a
brandy
i
cant
believe
i
only
have
2
bottles
again
wow
batch44
this
is
a
beguiling
beer
the
flavor
is
blended
to
the
point
that
i
cant
pull
it
apart
it
is
like
a
good
curry
the
beer
has
an
integrated
experience
that
blends
all
the
aspects
of
the
ba
evaluation
into
one
i
often
will
be
able
to
write
about
the
different
components
of
the
experience
of
a
beer
in
this
one
i
dont
care
to
bother
it
is
too
good
to
evaluate
its
more
important
to
enjoy
this
beer
breaks
through
the
taste
is
delicious
gooey
caramel
butterscotch
notes
followed
by
sour
mash
warming
booze
spice
and
a
pinch
of
green
hops
the
sweet
thickness
kind
of
reminds
me
of
a
recent
homebrewed
wort
that
i
tried
before
pitching
the
yeast
except
that
its
cooled
and
carbonated
the
mouthfeel
is
sticky
and
thick
with
a
nearly
perfect
carbonation
level
despite
the
high
abv
and
a
lingering
bittersweet
finish
the
alcohol
brings
that
warm
fuzzy
feel
to
both
palate
and
stomach
cheshire
cat
grin
my
overall
impression
is
pretty
high
for
fred
as
a
burgeoning
barleywine
fan
this
hit
the
complexity
and
flavor
out
of
the
park
granted
the
thickness
and
alcohol
levels
are
a
bit
much
to
make
this
anything
but
a
sipping
beer
and
i
was
afraid
it
would
have
gone
flat
glad
to
find
that
it
wasnt
i
should
have
bought
more
of

mouth
smooth
mouthfeel
really
creamy
huge
complexity
in
flavor
hops
are
strong
with
grapefruit
taste
malts
are
sweet
and
fruity
and
carry
a
lot
of
spice
notes
like
freshly
baked
spice
cake
everything
is
perfectly
balanced
including
the
after
effect
which
is
a
combination
between
bittering
hops
spicy
sweet
malt
and
a
warming
alcoholic
exhale
very
nice
d
it
is
pretty
darn
good
it
is
a
sipper
im
glad
i
got
to
try
this
and
if
it
was
available
i
would
buy
some
but
not
all
the
time
its
a
beer
that
would
suit
better
if
your
craving
a
barley
wine
i
would
also
prefer
just
a
tad
bigger
body
to
go
with
the
strong
flavors
d
a
sipping
beer
for
sure
but
enjoyable
from
start
to
finish
beer
changes
as
it
warms
it
may
take
me
over
an
hour
to
drink
this
beer
but
i
can
tell
you
that
when
the
last
sip
is
gone
im
very
tempted
to
pop
open
another
one
which
i
have
done
on
occasion
if
it
wasnt
for
that
damn
100
per
case
price
tag
one
of
two
bottles
purchased
at
capones
in
norristown
pa
bottle
foams
up
and
out
after
opening
but
luckily
i
had
a
glass
ready
to
go
pours
red
to
gold
with
significant
flecks
of
sediment
and
a
big
puffy
head
odor
is
of
teffee
and
malt
and
fermenting
fruits
alcohol
is
in
there
as
as
a
brandylike
quality
taste
is
great
all
the
flavors
come
together
beautifully
hoppiness
concentrated
in
the
head
and
make
the
first
sips
somewhat
bitter
then
it
becomes
sweeter
with
a
sweet
caramel
malt
with
only
a
hint
of
bitterness
alcohol
well
hidden
in
the
flavor
peaches
and
raspberries
and
big
overripe
plums
are
in
the
flavor
too
maybe
could
use
a
cellaring
to
reduce
the
hops
just
a
tiny
bit
more
as
it
becomes
increasingly
bitter
as
i
drink
full
bodied
without
being
cloying
very
drinkable
overwhelmingly
so
like
a
good
thomas
hardy
with
a
bit
more
of
a
hop
presence
overall
a
well
made
and
well
balanced
barley
wine
its
definitely
big
bold
and
intense
it
loses
some
of
its
sweetness
and
becomes
a
little
more
harsh
as
it
warms
to
room
temperature
drinkability
is
good
this
is
a
very
nice
and
interesting
barley
wine
it
doesnt
really
taste
like
anything
i
have
tasted
in
the
style
but
that
is
not
a
bad
thing
this
is
a
very
tasty
brew
well
done
hair
of
the
dog
damn
fine
beer
wish
i
had
a
ton
more
d
its
actually
quite
drinkable
for
such
a
big
and
alcoholic
beer
its
a
sipper
and
its
really
an
excellent
beer
d
we
got
a
sipper
enjoyable
on
a
sunday
afternoon
before
football
not
something
for
everyday
but
worth
getting
if
you
can
get
your
hands
on
one
was
lucky
enough
to
score
a
12
ounce
bottle
of
this
beer
in
porter
square
which
by
the
way
is
from
2003
pours
a
murky
strawberry
color
with
a
perfect
looking
white
head
aroma
had
lots
of
overripe
fruits
mainly
strawberry
cherry
and
grape
the
alcohol
is
also
well
hidden
in
the
aroma
taste
starts
off
somewhat
fruity
and
syrupy
then
ends
on
a
more
dry
grainy
note
a
bit
of
honey
can
be
felt
throughout
as
it
swishes
around
the
mouth
the
body
of
this
beer
is
pretty
big
yet
dangerous
in
its
drinkability
the
guy
from
liquor
world
was
right
on
the
money
when
he
said
that
this
beer
was
a
lot
more
calmed
down
from
when
it
was
new
in
fact
i
am
pretty
sure
the
last
time
i
tasted
it
was
in
03
and
i
can
remember
it
being
very
hot
this
is
definitely
a
beer
that
has
benefited
from
some
time
in
the
cellar
although
it
is
over
five
bucks
for
a
single
this
is
something
that
i
could
see
myself
purchasing
again
my
favorite
beer
so
far
from
hair
of
the
dog
now
this
was
a
real
treat
i
have
wanted
to
try
this
for
i
cannot
even
remember
how
long
and
to
finally
be
able
to
made
me
very
happy
indeed
this
one
poured
a
nice
hazy
golden
amber
with
a
thick
white
frothy
head
a
nice
amount
of
sediment
was
visible
as
was
a
good
deal
of
carbonation
the
retention
was
excellent
and
this
led
to
quite
a
good
deal
of
side
glass
lace
there
was
a
tremendously
hoppy
aroma
and
this
took
me
a
bit
by
surprise
however
i
am
learning
this
seems
to
be
the
norm
from
the
brewery
regardless
of
the
style
there
was
defiantly
a
light
fruit
peach
pear
yeast
component
to
the
aroma
as
well
but
the
quick
crisp
citrus
hoppiness
of
it
really
put
it
over
the
top
such
a
nice
medium
body
with
great
carbonation
really
let
the
flavors
really
pop
and
then
linger
to
let
you
get
the
full
experience
very
nice
bright
flavor
profile
lots
of
lemon
and
coriander
mixed
with
a
pronounced
yeast
flavor
and
a
very
nice
light
but
noticeable
bread
backing
a
slight
hint
of
alcohol
but
nothing
overwhelming
and
it
was
actually
a
nice
little
extra
punch
to
it
this
was
a
fantastic
brew
as
i
am
learning
pretty
much
everything
of
theirs
is
a
really
great
big
golden
ale
with
a
decidedly
west
coast
hoppiness
added
in
for
good
measure
this
was
a
really
cool
thing
to
try
and
i
would
love
to
see
this
in
regular
rotation
on
my
neck
of
the
woods
this
is
a
definite
must
try
if
you
can
get
it
this
is
one
of
the
best
barleywines
that
ive
had
yet
behind
only
averys
samael
great
divides
old
ruffian
and
victorys
old
horizontal
the
mouthfeel
is
good
huge
body
surprising
balance
for
such
a
big
and
overwhelming
beer
the
aftertaste
lingers
forever
just
a
little
bit
of
a
burn
could
be
much
more
drinkable
if
the
raisin
was
toned
down
quite
a
bit
pretty
good
though
quite
drinkable
for
the
abv
it
didnt
require
slow
sipping
and
was
consumed
rather
quickly
an
allaround
quality
barleywine
that
exhibits
a
rather
uncommon
level
of
balance
these
hotd
beers
certainly
live
up
to
the
hype
definitely
recommended
this
refers
to
a
12
oz
bottle
of
batch
67
fred
poured
in
a
tulip
glass
on
82207
pours
clear
dark
honey
with
thick
bubbly
head
with
bubbles
ranging
from
v
small
to
14
and
small
bubbles
rising
up
through
the
body
l
nice
somewhat
uneven
lacing
smells
of
warm
sweet
malt
with
honey
and
doughy
yeast
and
mild
alcoholic
scent
the
initial
flavor
is
big
malty
and
sweet
if
and
a
nice
long
lived
bitter
aftertaste
the
bitterness
is
strong
enough
that
you
can
almost
feel
it
in
your
teeth
long
lived
tasty
and
very
interesting
the
overall
impression
is
of
a
reasonably
balanced
beer
although
neither
the
initial
flavor
nor
the
aftertaste
is
particularly
wellbalanced
but
the
combination
of
the
two
creates
a
sense
of
balance
because
they
are
so
big
and
so
different
the
transition
from
big
malt
to
refreshing
hop
bitterness
makes
this
possible
the
mouthfeel
is
fullbodied
with
slightly
creamy
texture
lively
carbonation
and
somewhat
alcoholic
finish
this
is
an
ultraclassic
beer
that
has
complex
flavor
and
a
beautiful
appearance
definitely
a
must
for
any
tasting
list
stock
up
on
a
visit
to
portland
as
it
is
not
very
common
outside
the
pacific
nw
pours
a
slightly
hazy
redorange
with
a
huge
creamy
head
that
is
insanely
resiliant
i
could
eat
the
head
with
a
spoon
smells
of
many
different
fruits
some
spice
caramel
and
yeast
this
is
a
huge
beer
many
different
flavors
going
on
big
fruit
dried
and
juicy
alcohol
big
malt
rye
finishes
with
some
spice
feels
very
full
and
creamy
in
the
mouth
the
abv
is
apparant
but
not
in
a
bad
way
warms
you
up
nicely
this
is
a
sipper
through
and
through
and
absolutely
incredible
very
complex
and
original
and
as
it
warms
up
more
and
more
shows
this
is
a
must
try
for
any
ba
too
expensive
for
what
amounts
to
a
decent
example
of
the
style
for
an
american
style
barleywine
i
expected
a
lot
more
hop
bite
overall
a
great
beer
with
lots
of
flavors
and
alc
very
enjoyable
but
i
could
only
drink
like
one
a
month
overall
impression
drinkability
to
die
for
really
great
stuff
its
a
bit
of
a
gusher
but
that
bottle
conditioning
makes
for
a
heck
of
a
head
the
aroma
is
a
touch
simple
mostly
just
like
sweet
alcoholic
malts
the
flavor
open
up
more
with
the
spicy
rye
coming
through
over
fruitier
and
light
caramel
malts
its
also
like
theres
some
earthy
root
flavors
with
the
rye
its
almost
like
a
strange
mix
of
perfume
with
lemon
orange
and
toffee
theres
a
balancing
bitterness
that
makes
a
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
worth
mentioning
tastes
a
bit
like
some
americanmade
english
barleywines
but
the
rye
puts
this
in
its
own
dimension
definitely
an
unusual
beer
give
it
a
try
itll
give
you
plenty
to
think
about
a
truly
exceptional
beer
from
a
great
brewery
my
favorite
of
their
products
that
ive
had
batch
69
poured
a
beautiful
hazy
dark
orange
with
little
head
but
excellent
lacing
the
smell
had
deep
aromas
of
candi
sugar
orange
blossom
honey
lemon
zest
and
brandied
raisins
wonderful
the
taste
is
even
nicer
with
the
sweet
flavors
being
complimented
by
a
great
earthy
piney
hoppy
bitterness
on
the
finish
big
and
on
the
sweet
side
like
a
barley
wine
with
additional
flavors
of
sweet
orange
fruitcake
sweet
malt
and
the
same
notes
as
were
in
the
aroma
mouthfeel
is
exceptional
smooth
creamy
and
substantial
excellent
drinkability
as
well
its
definitely
a
sipper
but
it
is
also
immensely
satisfying
kudos
fullbodied
with
a
medium
level
of
carbonation
as
drinkable
as
a
barleywine
can
be
highly
recommended
and
now
you
see
what
makes
this
brew
worth
fawning
over
the
flavor
is
exceptional
i
wont
even
attempt
to
pick
it
apart
that
would
be
like
critiquing
a
princess
attire
as
you
stood
before
her
this
beer
commands
respect
and
demands
to
be
sipped
rather
than
drank
it
is
not
a
hop
bomb
in
the
traditional
sense
but
has
boundless
hop
characteristics
in
other
words
it
isnt
bitter
but
has
a
ton
of
citrusfruitfloral
notes
and
the
sweetness
from
the
malt
is
anything
but
cloying
much
like
the
adam
from
the
same
brewery
i
think
the
words
that
best
describe
this
beer
are
amazing
balanced
and
unique
simply
put
i
love
this
beer
d
a
real
sipper
that
should
be
saved
for
a
frigid
night
i
dont
think
i
could
have
more
than
1
in
a
sitting
drinkability
for
me
this
stuff
is
like
a
taste
of
heaven
i
could
happily
sit
and
sip
this
for
hours
i
think
this
is
the
worlds
first
reverse
double
ipa
absolutely
amazing
how
much
fig
is
in
the
beer
like
drinking
fig
juice
sappy
piney
bitter
long
finish
very
bold
masculine
and
complex
brew
here
thick
mouthcoating
malt
clings
to
the
palate
and
wont
let
go
hints
of
alcohol
german
roasted
almonds
grassy
hop
flavors
dates
prune
brown
sugar
made
with
too
much
mollases
pure
maple
syrup
and
golden
raisin
a
bit
spicey
on
the
finish
a
beer
worth
drinking
and
drinking
often
although
more
than
one
or
two
in
a
sitting
could
both
be
tough
to
swallow
and
tough
on
the
liver
beautiful
beer
nice
pillowy
creamcolored
head
on
top
of
an
amber
yellow
brew
glorious
smells
like
fresh
barley
and
cleancut
hops
tastes
like
fresh
figs
burnt
sugar
and
malty
goodness
warming
as
it
goes
down
nicely
balenced
and
very
smooth
i
love
bottle
conditioned
beers
and
hair
of
the
dog
brews
some
of
the
best
beers
around
this
one
is
good
now
but
worth
laying
down
a
few
and
revisitng
after
a
few
years
wow
great
beer
here
42208
another
bottle
batch
62
have
held
onto
this
one
for
a
few
years
not
sure
how
old
it
is
exactly
as
much
as
i
liked
it
before
i
have
to
say
after
some
years
in
the
cellar
it
improves
even
more
my
first
though
after
several
sips
was
simply
golden
it
was
really
all
i
could
think
about
that
it
was
golden
thanks
to
wonderful
bas
i
have
one
for
this
review
and
one
to
age
for
a
couple
of
years
my
guess
this
will
taste
great
with
some
time
on
it
flavour
is
decently
balanced
with
some
breaddoughy
malt
and
little
bit
of
astringency
in
the
finish
woody
notes
in
the
aftertaste
plus
some
sour
crabapple
bitter
grapefruit
hops
throughout
i
gave
it
a
3
5
for
drinkability
because
i
dont
think
i
could
have
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
drink
slowly
d
the
alcohol
presence
is
incredibly
restrained
and
subtle
dont
get
me
wrong
my
face
was
feeling
pretty
flushed
by
the
end
of
this
but
that
feeling
came
out
of
left
field
this
is
a
great
barleywine
orangebrown
in
color
after
a
vigorous
pour
there
was
still
a
negligible
amount
of
head
aroma
is
subdued
but
earthy
minimal
carbonation
subtle
soft
mouthfeel
very
delicate
but
tasty
flavors
alcohol
is
barely
perceivable
not
bad
very
drinkable
considering
the
abv
pours
a
cloudy
brownish
color
some
carbonation
huge
creamy
tannish
head
tons
of
sticky
lacing
throughout
the
drink
the
nose
is
malty
licorice
toffeecaramel
the
taste
is
malty
little
tangyness
slightly
sweet
lots
of
toffeecaramel
medium
body
very
drinkable
this
is
a
slightly
different
barleywine
but
very
tasty
slightly
complex
brew
highly
recommended
d
this
is
a
beer
to
sip
if
i
ever
had
one
think
about
christmas
snow
nighttime
sweaters
and
roaring
fireplaces
in
a
bottle
many
thanks
to
dubbercody
for
the
bottle
sent
for
my
ba
annv
thick
medium
body
with
little
carbonation
the
alcohol
is
hot
with
this
one
sneaks
up
on
you
a
bit
as
well
if
it
wasnt
for
that
i
would
have
given
it
at
least
a
4
12
oz
bottle
poured
carefully
into
a
snifter
i
didnt
see
any
sediment
that
others
have
mentioned
the
color
was
bright
and
golden
the
smell
was
hoppy
and
a
little
alcohol
the
taste
was
really
good
and
reminded
me
a
little
of
old
guardian
strong
abv
did
not
really
get
in
the
way
delicious
beer
wish
i
could
get
it
here
in
co
i
could
have
2
of
these
but
thats
about
it
seeing
as
this
is
10
abv
i
consider
2
drinkable
tasty
as
expected
a
bit
sticky
sweet
but
the
hops
come
in
on
the
finish
to
take
care
of
the
sweetness
for
the
finish
great
beer
at
almost
5
per
12oz
bottle
this
will
not
be
a
staple
for
me
but
ill
gladly
plop
down
the
for
this
one
from
time
to
time
i
could
drink
a
couple
of
these
the
alchohol
is
very
well
hid
this
beer
sits
with
a
hazy
amber
color
and
does
not
have
much
head
to
speak
of
the
aroma
seems
more
oxidized
than
the
ed
that
i
had
along
side
it
the
flavor
is
sweet
definitely
way
more
than
the
corresponding
ed
the
hops
have
mellowed
considerably
over
the
years
a
sweetness
melts
to
light
notes
of
oxidation
sherry
toasted
malt
and
caramelized
notes
as
it
passes
through
the
mouth
the
hops
are
all
that
really
lingers
on
in
the
finish
it
is
lightly
bitter
but
still
pinelike
notes
and
citrus
character
are
still
found
this
has
aged
quite
gracefully
over
the
years

ale
with
a
foamy
white
head
with
perfect
retention
and
lacing
aroma
of
hops
is
clearly
dominating
with
some
sweet
malt
taste
is
a
good
balance
mix
between
some
floral
and
bitter
hops
as
well
as
some
sugar
and
a
nice
malt
backbone
a
tad
too
hoppy
for
my
taste
in
barley
wine
but
still
very
enjoyable
and
something
that
i
could
see
aging
quite
well
if
you
come
across
this
beer
i
implore
you
try
it
but
please
leave
a
few
bottles
for
me
and
hair
of
the
dog
brewery
get
to
work
you
have
a
lot
more
of
these
to
make
great
beer
overall
i
have
a
fred
from
the
wood
that
ill
give
a
try
in
the
near
future
to
compare
id
also
like
to
try
a
fresh
fred
to
see
how
this
beer
has
evolved
from
the
fresh
version
worth
seeking
this
one
out
this
beer
is
so
yummy
the
drinkability
is
high
so
is
the
likelihood
that
youll
get
hammered
if
you
dont
pay
attention
although
i
havent
shopped
around
for
these
at
3
25single
from
trader
joes
i
probably
wont
be
sucking
these
down
by
the
6
pack
although
lord
knows
i
could
looks
like
ill
have
to
do
some
shopping

again
the
potent
alcohol
but
would
i
have
another
eventually
after
some
aging
absolutely
overall
impressions
are
of
a
very
intense
brew
perhaps
better
after
some
aging
complex
and
tough
to
get
your
head
around
but
delicious
just
the
same
d
the
bottle
claims
a
desire
to
make
unusual
beer
styles
give
them
a
gold
star
quite
unlike
anything
ive
had
batch
63
this
is
a
beer
that
is
that
has
a
lot
going
on
it
poured
an
opaque
orangebrown
with
little
yeasties
floating
here
and
there
a
nice
thin
yet
well
defined
head
it
smells
sweet
and
bitter
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
smell
with
the
sweet
becoming
a
malty
caramel
flavor
and
the
bitter
is
piney
with
an
alcohol
residue
that
sticks
to
the
tongue
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
rich
plenty
of
body
not
a
whole
lot
of
carbonation
a
beer
worth
trying
drinkability
is
good
the
alcohol
is
balanced
well
against
the
malt
and
bitterness
if
anything
the
bitterness
is
a
little
higher
than
it
needs
to
be
but
its
still
quite
good
looking
forward
to
trying
the
others
i
have
from
this
batch
with
a
little
age
another
batch
54
from
beerbeing
for
my
anny
41107
looks
great
almost
like
a
belgian
barleywine
with
some
very
tripel
characteristics
nice
spicy
aroma
with
notes
of
orange
and
licorice
went
well
with
some
parrano
cheese
drinkability
12
of
12oz
will
be
easy
md
tingling
bubbles
and
decent
carbonation
thick
mouthfeel
interesting
and
well
worth
it
for
the
3
50
a
bottle
definitely
would
buy
this
one
again
drinkability
notes
its
got
everything
why
wouldnt
you
want
to
drink
it
why
arent
incredible
beers
everywhere
otherwise
this
one
would
be
a
regular
pours
from
the
12oz
bottle
a
slightly
cloudy
goldenorange
color
topped
by
a
halfinch
of
creamy
tan
head
that
leaves
a
nice
trail
on
down
the
glass
aroma
of
sweet
caramel
malt
candy
sugar
sweet
dark
fruit
light
fruity
hops
and
a
generous
whiff
of
alcohol
palate
is
a
delightfully
sweet
sticky
blend
of
sweet
caramel
malt
and
mildly
fruity
hops
notes
of
plum
treacle
and
biscuit
come
through
with
a
gentle
warming
from
the
alcohol
building
to
a
substantial
heat
at
the
swallow
body
is
rich
creamy
and
just
about
perfectly
smooth
goes
down
about
as
easy
as
any
10
beer
ive
ever
had
a
wonderful
concoction
from
one
of
the
greatest
breweries
around
poured
a
deep
amberorange
with
a
huge
frothy
head
and
left
some
nice
lacing
the
aromas
were
sweet
fruity
with
a
bit
of
toasted
caramel
the
flavor
a
beer
of
this
size
was
very
nice
hop
bitterness
up
front
then
quickly
squashed
with
a
sweet
caramely
malty
smoothness
and
then
finsihed
with
a
lingering
bitterness
alcohol
is
masked
beautifully
with
this
one
mouthfeel
creamy
smooth
and
delightful
overall
a
very
nice
drink
very
nice
a
pleasure
to
sip
this
is
weird
and
strong
enough
to
decrease
the
everydaydrinkability
factor
but
theres
a
lot
going
on
here
and
its
unique
and
most
importantly
delicious
any
barley
wine
enthusiast
should
seek
it
out
drinkability
both
of
these
beers
have
very
complex
characteristics
and
should
be
consumed
slowly
also
the
10
abv
is
felt
pretty
quickly
also
recommended

a
nice
golden
orange
with
thick

that
lingers
throughout
entire

and
leaves
decent

aroma
was
a
mixed
bag
of
malty
sour
dark
fruit
and
citrusy
hops
flavor
early
accentuated
this
blend
perfectly
as
beer
warmed
at
midglass
the
10
alcohol
made
its
presence
known
in
the
taste
finish
was
a
good
blend
of
dry
sour
and
bitter
that
left
me
wanting
more
hair
of
the

did
very
well
once
again
just
pod
that
i
cant
get
their
beers
in

cheers
to
fred
both
the
writer
the
beer
batch
49
poured
a
hazy
amber
color
with
a
medium
sized
off
white
head
that
left
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
of
floral
hops
citrus
fruits
caramel
malts
sherry
and
light
alcohol
much
of
the
same
in
the
taste
hops
were
still
forward
and
the
alcohol
was
also
a
bit
strong
taste
the
hops
are
there
but
not
really
as
strong
as
the
nose
lead
me
to
believe
even
so
their
presence
is
welcome
and
not
disapointing
at
all
the
caramel
malts
come
out
nicely
and
adds
a
very
syrupy
sweetness
to
smooth
out
the
hops
in
the
finish
theres
a
bit
of
cherries
and
other
darks
fruits
mouthfeel
is
defintely
on
the
full
side
with
a
good
drinkabiltiy
that
would
be
higher
without
the
syrupy
sweetness
batch
63
this
beer
pours
with
a
tarnished
gold
color
with
terrific
lacing
that
seems
to
last
forever
smell
is
pleasant
with
the
alcohol
dominating
and
a
small
hint
of
dried
fruit
it
has
a
fullbodied
taste
thats
slightly
bitter
with
a
definite
hop
bite
the
yeast
is
strangely
apparent
as
well
a
sign
that
this
beer
has
spent
a
good
amount
of
time
in
the
fementor
malty
finish
with
just
a
touch
of
burnt
husk
probably
from
rye
surprisingly
drinkable
for
such
a
large
beer
almost
11
abv
and
65
ibus
and
the
mouth
feel
is
enjoyable
the
whole
way
down
ive
been
waiting
to
be
wowed
for
a
while
and
this
one
has
done
it
sweet
and
in
your
face
up
front
which
transitions
into
an
intricate
evergreen
hop
blend
ten
varieties
according
to
the
bottle
acquired
at
shoreline
im
glad
this
was
recommended
to
me
by
a
worker
this
is
phenomenal
and
sadly
i
only
picked
up
a
few
bottles
perfect
light
tan
head
greater
than
an
inch
in
thickness
with
superb
retention
listed
as
a
golden
special
ale
it
looks
much
darker
with
a
tanorange
hue
the
aroma
is
strong
and
complex
smell
of
winegrapes
with
a
sweet
cookielike
malt
nose
and
a
hint
of
cinnamon
spice
taste
of
strong
bready
malt
and
alcohol
overpower
me
at
first
hints
of
chocolate
and
raisin
also
come
through
and
the
finish
carries
a
mild
astringency
medium
bodied
with
nice
carbonation
the
drinkablility
suffers
a
bit
from
the
brute
strength
of
this
beer
i
seemed
to
notice
the
alcohol
effects
slightly
more
than
other
10
abv
brews
ive
tried
with
its
unique
flavor
im
glad
i
found
it
especially
with
4
years
aging
drinkability
id
like
to
try
one
of
these
fresh
to
compare
pretty
good
barleywine
as
is
though
nice
tribute
to
fred
eckhardt
d
very
much
a
sipping
beer
and
a
nice
one
at
that
i
dont
think
i
would
have
another
in
the
same
night
but
it
is
a
nice
way
to
end
the
night
d
in
this
league
this
one
is
alright
its
a
sipping
drink
if
you
want
to
keep
control
and
listen
to
what
your
tounge
tells
you
this
should
be
drank
by
the
select
few
fwho
can
really
take
it
its
a
very
solid
strong
ale
not
exactly
barley
wine
dogfish
head
says
ale
the
pour
was
nearly
perfect
but
there
was
too
much
head
dont
get
me
wrong
i
love
head
wink
wink
but
five
fingers
worth
for
this
style
is
a
bit
much
imo
lots
of
intricate
lacing
nose
is
rum
and
caramel
taste
is
caramel
rum
grapefruit
and
pine
mouth
ripples
in
intricate
carbonation
over
the
tongue
a
very
good
beer
but
there
are
many
that
do
it
better
for
cheaper
d
delicious
warm
a
favorite
of
mine
a
sipper
at
10
abv
but
a
completely
satisfying
experience
enjoy
sugary
honey
sweetness
alcohol
and
fruits
to
start
but
with
a
surprisingly
stiff
bitter
finish
and
aftertaste
that
washes
away
any
chance
of
being
cloying
mediumfull
body
with
a
prickly
carbonation
compares
well
to
belgian
ales
only
detriment
is
a
slightly
lower
drinkability
due
to
the
prominence
of
the
alcohol
d
friggin
good
beer
i
cant
wait
to
try
the
woody
version
overall
i
just
bought
this
bottle
from
a
beer
bar
closing
in
the
area
sniff
sniff
so
im
not
sure
how
old
this
one
was
but
id
like
to
try
newer
and
older
batches
to
get
a
better
sense
of
what
they
are
shooting
for
here
the
bottle
says
a
golden
ale
but
this
is
more
of
a
barleywine
if
you
ask
me
i
liked
it
a
lot
but
i
didnt
get
exactly
what
i
expected
so
what
can
you
say
about
fred
freds
fred
acccept
him
for
what
he
is
let
him
warm
up
to
you
and
take
him
in
small
doses
cheers
i
am
shocked
at
this
beer
the
lable
on
the
bottle
had
me
thinking
another
lawn
mower
beer
this
is
as
far
on
the
other
side
of
that
spectrum
as
you
can
get
this
would
give
any
barley
wine
or
triple
bock
a
run
for
the
money
this
is
perhaps
the
finest
barley
wine
ive
ever
had
nicely
drinkable
tasty
barleywine
this
would
have
been
a
very
highly
rated
beer
had
the
head
not
been
so
enormous
it
was
a
task
to
drink
fred
i
wish
he
would
have
made
it
easier
on
me
quite
an
interesting
brew
one
that
i
would
certainly
like
to
have
more
of
would
have
given
higher
ratings
had
the
alcohol
been
hidden
a
little
bit
better
when
i
taste
this
beer
for
the
first
time
various
expletives
come
from
my
mouth
it
is
that
fukin
good
multigrain
nutbread
huge
carmel
malt
toffee
and
butterscotch
slight
anise
brown
sugar
figs
and
dates
and
a
tiny
bit
of
sherry
butter
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
chewy
drinkability
is
a
five
drinkability
along
with
adam
hair
of
the
dog
makes
two
of
the
most
astounding
beers
i
have
tasted
full
of
flavor
but
never
over
the
top
this
is
a
powerful
barleywine
its
packed
with
all
kinds
of
flavors
and
only
gets
more
interesting
as
it
warms
it
could
use
less
alcohol
heat
still
its
worth
a
try
id
buy
this
again
for
sure
mine
poured
a
slightly
cloudy
deeply
redlike
amber
with
no
real
head
to
speak
of
the
nose
which
i
loved
had
a
spicy
and
malty
quality
with
a
finish
of
promising
hopinness
the
alcohol
also
peaks
its
head
up
into
the
nose
as
well
the
flavor
and
the
beers
drinkability
are
both
dangerous
the
beer
proved
to
be
surprisingly
balanced
with
spicy
maltiness
and
dry
hoppy
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
much
ligther
than
i
anticipated
and
with
a
low
alcohol
flavor
the
beer
could
prove
to
be
surprisingly
dangerous
full
bodied
chewy
high
alcohol
but
very
drinkable

nice

very
well
done
and
a
kick
in

liver
this
is
easily
the
most
complex
review
ive
attempted
thus
far
first
thing
that
comes
to
mind
when
tasting
is
that
this
truly
does
have
that
beerwine
mix
flavor
to
it
brewed
with
ten
different
hop
varieties
and
multiple
malts
this
barley
wine
makes
it
difficult
to
disinguish
flavors
brings
with
it
an
ititial
bite
to
the
palate
followed
by
earthy
tones
with
a
lingering
alcohol
presence
behind
the
heavy
malt
leaves
behind
a
heavy
trail
of
lacing
on
the
glass
as
it
goes
down
a
very
complex
brew
here
definitely
worth
a
try
notes
oily
mouthfeel
lingers
and
is
sticky

this
is
a

is
more
toward

side
but
this
would
probably
mellow
out
with
age
as
the
bottle
suggests
da
worth
a
try
especially
for
fans
of
the
barley
wine
and
heavy
ale
styles
but
have
a
glass
of
water
handy
to
wet
the
palate
ok
drinkability
but
can
be
a
little
harsh
this
could
use
some
more
time
maybe
not
a
lot
but
some
12oz
bottle
from
batch
46
which
according
to
their
websites
was
brewed
91102
and
bottled
three
months
later

with
the
typical

huge
frothy

awesome

and
lacing
as
ive
come
to
expect
from
hotd
beers
big
ripe
fruity
nose
with
plenty
of
malt
sweetness
and
still
some
bitter
citric
hops
kicking
around
in
the
background
alcohol
is
noticeable
but
doesnt
detract
from
the
scent
flavor
is
really
big
with
and
upfront
dark
ripe
fruit
sweetness
caramel
and
a
touch
of
molasses
a
surprising
about
of
bitter
hops
are
still
coming
through
in
the
flavor
that
keep
the
sweetness
in
check
finishes
up
with
more
fruits
and
a
slight
bitter
bite
extremely
smooth
with
a
thick
body
with
plenty
of
carbonation
maybe
a
bit
too
much
carbonation
goes
down
easier
than
could
be
expected
excellent
barley

all
around
that
i
am

5drinkability
is
ok
and
so
is
the
brew
not
surprisingly
and
the
syrupy
and
earthy
sweetness
masks
any
hops
i
might
have
expected
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
but
in
a
slap
you
in
the
face
sort
of
way
this
is
a
big
beer
and
has
loads
of
complexities
exceptional
nose
and
a
complexity
of
flavors
that
i
will
be
thinking
about
for
quite
awhile
the
initial
appearance
and
smell
the
hazy
golden
color
and
what
i
thought
was
a
pronounced
hoppy
aroma
made
me
think
ruination
but
sadly
this
is
not
the
case
upon
imbibing
this
brew
the
alcohol
hits
like
a
fist
to
the
face
and
carbonation
makes
a
thorough
examination
of
the
taste
impossible
id
like
to
poor
more
to
get
a
better
idea
but
im
afraid
the
head
will
rise
again
the
bubbles
are
still
rising
in
abundance
the
lace
is
very
thick
if
youre
wondering
if
i
get
the
rest
of
this
poured
before
the
beer
is
room
temperature
my
views
may
change
and
ill
amend
this
review
accordingly
but
as
it
is
this
is
not
a
beer
ill
be
enjoying
again
if
i
am
in
dorothy
lane
market
getting
coffee
or
beer
and
happen
to
see
it
id
forgotten
the
style
when
i
cracked
the
cap
and
started
into
the
brew
but
now
its
clear
that
its
meant
as
a
tripel
but
ends
up
being
a
rather
intriguing
variant
thick
chewy
sticky
fruity
gummy
yummy
this
fred
is
much
like
its
namesake
a
unique
particular
specimen
that
is
rich
in
character
and
defies
categories
a
cantankerous
unruly
ale
that
stretches
boundaries
and
delights
tastebuds
i
need
to
meet
up
with
this
fred
more
often
high
quality
but
not
as
enjoyable
as
their
adam
fred
is
sort
of
a
wild
and
raw
edged
brew
for
the
most
part
the
flavors
tend
to
remain
separate
and
easily
distinguishable
from
the
others
drinkability
not
sure
how
to
classify
this
one
i
enjoyed
tasting
it
but
not
sure
how
much
i
like
it
quite
alcoholic
in
the
taste
needs
more
malt
to
offer
more
balance
there
is
a
massive
malt
flavor
that
starts
you
out
sweet
the
hops
come
in
to
balance
and
they
do
so
very
well
there
is
a
lot
of
alcohol
flavor
in
this
one
but
it
is
welcomed
as
there
is
enough
flavor
to
balance
the
carbonation
is
very
light
aiding
in
a
rich
and
smooth
mouthfeel
it
has
excellent
complexity
and
the
intense
flavor
will
keep
you
interested
drinkability
still
remains
pretty
good
even
though
the
alcohol
flavor
is
a
bit
big

very

cant
wait
to
wait
a
year
and
see
how
it
ages
but
in

i
think
ill
need
to
get
a
six
or
three
i
dont
quite
remember
the
batch
number
but
it
was
not
more
than
a
couple
months
old
the
appearance
is
stuff
of

with

in
the
snifter
beautiful
cloudy

and
a
hotds
huge

aroma
is
mostly
complex

of

its
easy
to
believe
there

theres
the
big
american
c
hops
character
combined
with
the
refined

ones
very
relaxing

ultracomplex
like

tasting
this

came
to
the

given
the

to
pick
only
2
beers
from
a

to
have
an
infinite
supply
of
hotd
with

aroma
of

overtones
remind
me
of
a

in
my
opinion
sweet

candy
sugar
and
fruit
heavy

overall
a
really
nice
thanksgiving
warmer
this
ale
poured
a
hazy
amber
color
with
white
foam
that
settled
the
smell
was
sweet
and
malty
with
some
bitter
hops
aroma
and
a
hint
of
oakiness
the
taste
was
fruity
bitter
resinous
hops
balanced
with
malt
and
a
lightl
sweet
slightly
vinous
finish
there
was
a
slight
pervading
oakiness
possibly
due
to
oxidation
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
dry
overall
the
body
was
medium
with
moderate
carbonation
this
was
a
nice
old
ale
this
ale
is
well
intended
but
it
is
losing
much
in
its
translation
pours
to
an
orangishred
color
like
a
sunrise
with
just
a
ring
of
lacing
around
the
glass
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
fruity
citrusy
with
a
nice
malty
backbone
the
flavor
is
malty
upfront
with
a
sweet
fruitiness
that
flows
to
a
dry
bitter
alcoholic
finish
it
is
a
complex
beer
that
is
subdued
in
the
beginning
then
it
hits
you
with
a
mass
of
flavors
it
is
a
fullbodied
warming
brew
another
tasty
offering
from
hair
of
the
dog
bottom
line
a
nw
beer
with
outstanding
complexity
almost
perfect
this
beer
deserves
its
own
style
and
a
group
of
beers
trying
to
clone
the
flavor
this
was
a
very
nice
brew
indeed
drinkable
well
yes
if
you
like
to
sip
and
i
do
as
it
is
the
end
of
the
night
be
careful

not
quite
your
typical
golden
ale
a
golden
amber
body
with
a
gooey
retentive
head
very
opaque
depending
on
how
much
of
the
yeast
you
add
do
not
add
all

it

a

you

sweet
the
spices
permeate
all
aspects
of
the
flavor
and
the
hops
are
strong
at
the
end
the
alcohol
masks
the
fruity
flavors
and
keeps
them
from
being
distinguished
the
aftertaste
lingers
of
alcohol
and
eventually
you
are
left
with
just
hop
once
again
not
a
normal
golden
ale
you
have
to
prepare
yourself
for
it
know
the
brewery
first
off
but
once
you
do
this
is
quite
an
enjoyable
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
very
carbonated
and
has
to
be
to
help
with
drinkability
ironic
a
little
bit
thick
and
sticky
for
my
taste
but
also
a
very
nice
end
to
an
evening
just
allot
yourself
a
nice
span
of
time
in
which
to
enjoy
it
drinkability
the
poor
booze
masking
kinda
hurts
the
drinkability
a
bit
but
not
as
bad
as
others
ive
had
definite
sipper
make
sure
you
age
this
sucker
for
a
bit
before
consumption
nevertheless
a
bitter
dry
ale
with
a
sweetness
in
undertone
lots
of
flavor
but
the
alcohol
content
made
it
difficult
to
drink
too
much
of
this
brew
hence
my
reduced
drinkability
rating
i
confess
i
could
get
hammered
with
fred

considering
the
ten
percent

off
white
cream
color
with

linining
in
a
partial

scattered

aroma
now
this
is
where
this
beer
really
starts
to
get
exciting
a
barrage
of
pepper
and
citrus
orange
peels
come
at
me
like
dough
but
with
a
warming
sweetness
if
i
were
to
guess
what
type
of
hops
this
one
uses
i
would
go
with

this

i

never

than
one
of
these
at
a
time
challenging
enticing
just
not
a
session
ale
by
any
means
a
pretty
good
beer
but
the
alcohol
got
very
overwhelming
as
the
brew
got
warm
and
flatter
i
had
trouble
finishing
the
last
few
sips
as
it
started
to
take
on
a
strong
boozey
character
kind
of
a
wierd
frankenstein
feel
with
flavors
going
everywhere
and
an
odd
muddiness
to
the
hops

hed
probably

be
worth
it
just
to
land
one
punch
drinkability
is
dangerously
easy
however
the
abv
makes
this
take
a
hit
definitely

a

lover
has
to
try
at

try

they
loved

batch

i
dont
know
how
old
this
is
hops
are
mellowed
and
theres
quite
a
bit
of
sediment
but
the
alcohol
hasnt
gone
anywhere
a
big
tawny
orangeamber
beer
with
enormous
head
pleasing
aroma
a
substantially
malty
beer
with
hops
staying
well
in
the
background
giant
alcohol
finish
makes
you
wince
this
beer
took
some
getting
used
to
i
had
trouble
with
the
first
few
sips
too
sweet
cloying
alcoholic
by
midway
thru
the
glass
i
was
starting
to
get
into
the
swing
of
things
and
by
the
end
i
was
an
assured
fan
chalk
it
up
to
either
my
palate
getting
into
shape
the
craft
of
the
brew
or
the
giant
dose
of
alcohol
still
i
never
know
what
to
do
with
huge
strong
beers
like
these
they
are
good
for
special
occasions
sure
but
little
else
whipping
a
bottle
of
this
out
during
most
social
encounters
may
get
you
into
trouble
definitely
not
a
summer
beer
and
when
im
looking
for
something
strong
and
palatedemolishing
i
usually
bust
out
the
scotch
this
is
a
pleasant
beery
alternative
batch
36
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
a
big
glassfull
of
goldenorange
supports
and
aggressive
and
longlasting
offwhite
head
the
smell
is
peppery
and
malty
with
an
interesting
hop
smell
the
bottle
claims
10
hop
varieties
are
used
and
picking
out
one
dominant
hop
is
not
easy
a
whole
lot
is
going
on
in
the
taste
with
spice
and
pepper
hints
of
grapefruit
and
a
bit
of
hop
bite
everything
really
starts
to
come
together
after
it
has
been
sitting
at
room
temperature
for
an
hour
or
so
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
creamy
its
a
definite
sipper
okay
as
is
usually
the
case
with
this
brewer
this
beer
foamed
up
like
nobodys
business
no
matter
which
method
of
pouring
or
glass
style
it
poured
a
light
clear
amber
color
with
a
huge
off
white
foamy
head
that
left
latticed
lace
as
it
slowly
began
its
stubborn
depature
a
medium
amount
of
carbonation
is
present
surprising
considering
the
amount
of
head
i
would
had
expected
more
an
aroma
of
malt
caramel
and
alcohol
a
flavor
of
malt
caramel
and
alcohol
with
other
sweet
dark
fruit
flavors
floating
around
a
medium
body
and
a
slightly
sweet
yet
somewhat
bitter
finish
a
belgian
triple
with
barley
wine
elements
a
good
beer
thanks
to
weefisheads
for
the
bottles
quite
big
and
sweetish
nose
and
flavour
are
very
belgian
to
me
quite
floral
peppery
and
spicy
with
a
bittering
finish
helping
to
balance
out
the
sweetness
a
really
enoyable
beer
a
bit
saisony
aswell
i
didnt
realise
this
was
10abv
hidden
very
well
originally
sampled
on
2
february
2003
poured
a
cloudy
golden
color
w
an
enormous
head
looks
like
an
ipa
sweet
yet
hoppy
on
the
tongue
w
an
absolutely
smooth
finish
im
not
sure
why
this
is
called
a
barleywine
its
more
of
a
strong
ale
type
of
beer
anyway
its
definitely
a
great
beer
a
touch
of
crocket
mallet
to
whoop
your
ass
this
is
my
first
hair
of
the
dogbatch
42
and
it
was
a
middle
of
the
road
i
dont
think
that
this
is
quite
on
par
with
some
of
the
other
barleywines
i
have
hadarrogant
hampshire
or
celebration
there
was
just
something
off
about
it
if
poured
a
foggy
red
and
looked
like
most
bottle
conditioned
but
the
head
was
huge
and
did
not
stick
together
very
well
and
there
was
very
little
lace
to
speak
of
the
smell
reminded
me
quite
a
bit
of
the
hsa
with
lots
of
salty
smells
mixed
in
with
some
strong
bourbon
scents
there
was
a
fair
bit
of
malts
which
hid
the
hops
pretty
well
the
taste
was
too
acidic
and
the
hops
tasted
bland
it
did
leave
a
nice
whisky
burning
in
my
throat
and
i
would
probably
drink
this
again
in
the
winter
months
however
there
was
not
enough
complexity
which
led
to
a
bit
of
a
dissappointment
i
will
not
shy
away
from
hair
of
the
dog
but
i
recomend
a
careful
look
at
some
of
the
qualities
fred
is
lacking
the
annomynity
of
the
name
fred
suits
this
beer
well
for
now
this
beer
is
a
hazy
brownish
orange
with
bubbles
that
are
slow
to
rise
and
a
head
that
is
even
slower
to
fade
smells
a
bit
of
honey
a
very
nice
aroma
creamy
taste
and
a
little
sweet
very
tasty
and
the
flavors
stick
around
an
excellent
beer
but
the
sweet
creamy
weight
hurt
the
mouthfeel
and
drinkablity
but
only
slightly
the
picture
of
fred
with
the
pointed
helmet
of
a
wwi
german
soldier
should
have
been
a
clue
about
this
beer
for
fred
attacks
like
a
soldier
the
first
wave
starts
with
the
pour
pour
with
caution
because
this
beer
creates
an
enormous
pillowy
sticky
milky
colored
head
the
first
battle
was
lost
by
my
fiancée
who
opened
this
and
lost
some
of
its
wonderful
contents
due
to
the
colossal
head
it
created
the
second
wave
of
freds
blitzkrieg
assault
was
launch
with
chemical
warfare
that
wafted
from
the
nose
which
is
just
as
large
as
the
head
fred
attacked
with
ripe
orange
coriander
yeast
malt
flowers
spice
and
probably
much
more
had
i
had
time
to
recover
from
the
second
wave
then
the
third
wave
came
just
as
shocking
and
surprising
as
the
first
two
the
website
says
it
has
65
ibus
and
you
can
tell
fred
arsenal
consists
of
hops
hops
and
more
hops
this
attack
is
almost
overwhelming
at
first
and
can
be
a
sensory
overload
fred
assails
your
mouth
in
this
true
blitzkrieg
of
a
lemony
sweetness
then
hops
then
spice
then
malt
then
hops
again
followed
by
more
spicy
and
yet
more
hops
during
taste
attack
wave
i
was
distracted
and
didnt
see
the
flanking
assault
by
freds
secret
weapon
carbonation
freds
got
more
fizz
than
pigeon
eating
an
alkaseltzer
and
then
my
tongue
steps
on
freds
landmine
alcohol
the
bottle
says
10
abv
but
fred
fights
way
out
of
his
weight
class
ive
always
heard
its
not
the
size
of
the
dog
in
the
fight
but
the
size
of
the
fight
in
the
dog
well
freds
a
rabid
pit
bull
packed
into
a
12oz
bottle
fred
campaign
consumed
eight
casualties
as
we
passed
around
this
amazing
brew
i
dont
know
if
age
will
settle
fred
down
but
i
plan
on
being
on
freds
side
next
battle
and
i
cant
wait
for
round
two
drank
this
on
a
sunday
night
sitting
in
the
backyard
with
my
partner
looking
at
the
weekend
work
wed
done
what
a
way
to
end
a
great
weekend
a
wonderful
incredible
deep
and
ponderous
beer
recommended
highly
deep
and
hazy
pour
murky
and
highly
sedimented
orangey
sienna
color
with
lots
of
slowly
drifting
sediment
bright
white
head
and
laces
in
huge
sheets
nice
and
complex
smell
pithy
hops
and
a
counter
sense
of
molasses
and
caramel
on
the
flip
side
some
alcohol
sharpness
lots
of
flavors
going
on
poached
pear
nutmeg
buttery
toffee
diacetyls
and
a
sense
of
smoked
meat
begin
to
elevate
upon
warming
a
sense
of
prickly
hops
emerge
at
the
thick
close
a
testament
to
balance
here
frankly
a
little
sticky
sweet
for
my
overall
tastes
just
decent
drinkability
but
its
cool
that
hair
of
the
dog
keeps
flaming
on
a
honey
colored
brew
with
a
definite
haze
the
aroma
gives
hints
of
the
rye
malt
and
citrus
right
away
they
hops
are
apparent
followed
by
the
citrus
flavor
almost
grapefruit
in
nature
after
a
few
sip
some
of
the
spices
spring
up
in
the
flavor
not
overpowering
subtle
the
hop
character
and
citrus
undertones
make
this
an
intriguing
beer
its
not
a
beer
that
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
but
is
very
tastey
ive
been
thinking
back
fondly
on
this
beer
ever
since
i
drank
it
2
days
ago
i
would
have
thought
of
it
as
more
of
a
belgian
trippel
than
a
barley
wine
a
slightly
hazy
copperbronze
in
color
with
a
mediumsized
head
aroma
is
yeasty
with
a
zesty
orangepeel
component
and
heaps
of
spices
and
floral
hops
but
the
flavor
is
where
its
really
at
undergirded
by
a
sweet
maltiness
this
beer
has
layers
upon
layers
of
spices
corriander
stands
out
citric
hops
floral
hops
and
the
rye
seems
to
really
add
a
lot
of
pep
to
this
beer
tingly
finish
alcohol
warming
is
detectable
but
at
just
the
right
level
to
add
a
bit
of
depth
and
balance
the
citric
tangy
qualities
of
the
beer
mediumbodied
with
a
dry
finish
i
love
it
this
beer
grew
on
me
as
the
glass
slowly
and
i
mean
slowly
vanished
in
an
alcoholic
hopaholic
kind
of
fog
a
peach
colored
brew
with
creamy
head
this
one
smelled
of
peachorangesvanillaand
earthy
hops
the
flavors
at
cellar
temp
were
difficult
to
decipher
maybe
oranges
and
plums
with
an
earthy
hop
flavor
and
steady
bitterness
finishing
with
alcohol
the
beer
had
a
creamy
full
body
texture
like
a
nectar
as
we
warmed
to
room
temp
things
got
a
little
more
interesting
if
this
wasnt
interesting
enough
a
kaleidoscope
of
hops
layer
upon
layer
of
hop
flavors
me
thinks
the
alcohol
helps
spin
your
mind
while
the
hops
take
you
to
wonderland
an
exciting
trip
in
a
12
oz
bottle

beer
oozing

at

fl

took
me
a

to
dispatch
this
one
i
have
to
admit
glad
i
saved
it
until
last
murky
golden
in
hue
topped
by
a
very
thick
creamy
and
attractive
off
white
head
florally
sweet
honey
candy
coated
nuts
a
hint
of
grainy
spicy
rye

smells
sweet
and
luscious
intense
sugary
sweetness
hits
the
palate
upfront
but
as
that
slowly
fades

sweet
with

fred
is

perhaps
so

to
hurt

its

makes
it
a

thanks
go
to
bighuge
for
this
and
all
the
hotd
brews
this
brewery
certainly
has
my
attention
fred

poured
a
nice
orange
golden
color
with
some
cloudiness
due
to
the
yeast
nice
big
frothy
white
head
on
the
nose
was
pretty
strong
spiciness
pepperiness
due
to
the
hops
and
high
alcohol
on
the
palate
its
so
hard
to
tell
because
of
the
high
alcohol
volume
but
you
can
dectect
spiciness
slight
citrus
notes
and
slight
fruitiness
but
mostly
overrun
by
the
alcohol
there
is
a
nice
alcohol
warming
through
out
all
in
all
its
not
bad
bit
high
in
the
alcohol
range
and
over
runs
the
flavors
a
bit
266
my
only
wish
is
that
i
could
find
all
there
beer
easly
but
the
only
place
i
can
order
it
is
at
trader
joes
and
only
fred
adam
or
helen
now
i
have
to
drive
up
to
portland
oregon
to
pick
up
fred
no
one
in
northern
california
handles
it
yow
i
didnt
know
what
to
expect
from
this
one
when
i
bought
it
what
a
treat
the
beer
is
light
in
color
with
a
majestic
head
marvelous
in
an
old
belgian
tulip
glass
stunning
hop
aromas
and
nice
balance
of
bitterness
with
malt
backgrounds
bottle
conditioned
and
yeast
fragrance
and
taste
add
to
the
experience
pleasant
alcohol
warming
too
much
of
this
stuff
could
be
dangerous
overall
it
was
exceptional
i
loved
it
definitely
will
try
it
again
my
bottle
was
labeled
batch
36
this
beer
pours
a
nice
darker
shade
of
golden
with
a
tint
of
orange
minimal
white
head
what
a
nice
aroma
a
blend
of
orange
tangerine
grapefruit
subtle
spice
and
yeast
undertones
as
well
fruity
to
say
the
least
wow
what
a
unique
taste
this
is
the
first
beer
that
i
can
really
taste
some
apricotlike
flavors
extreme
citrus
flavor
and
yes
there
is
a
tad
of
alcohol
on
the
tongue
with
this
one
as
well
i
really
can
liken
this
to
drinking
a
citrus
blend
juice
like
an
orangetangerinegrapefruit
mix
there
is
a
bitterness
that
lingers
that
i
cant
decide
if
its
appealing
or
not
i
think
it
is
ok
this
is
probably
the
most
unique
beer
ive
had
in
months
and
well
worth
a
try
if
you
have
a
chance
this
is
definitely
a
very
interesting
beer
pours
a
beautiful
golden
color
with
a
very
thick
sticky
foamy
head
heavy
hops
in
the
nose
and
alcohol
as
well
complex
tangy
stinging
hops
taste
dominates
however
the
beer
has
a
nice
chewy
malt
balance
to
it
nice
effervescent
creamysticky
feel
on
the
palate
this
is
one
incredibly
different
beer
not
really
like
antyhing
ive
tasted
i
can
see
the
comparisons
to
a
barley
wine
but
it
is
also
very
different
worth
a
try
for
the
adventurous
beer
drinker
i
love
this
beer
and
the
brewery
what
a
line
of
products
they
produce
next
to
ipas
barley
wines
are
2nd
to
me
from
the
1st
sip
this
beer
says
hello
to
you
and
demands
to
be
recognized
i
wish
i
knew
what
hops
they
used
and
this
is
not
a
beer
for
the
faint
of
heart
at
11
5
abv
you
drink
this
one
slowly
and
savor
every
beautiful
sip
and
why
rush
alot
of
work
went
into
to
creating
such
a
fine
product
definitely
a
barley
wine
lovers
beer
fred
rules
i
do
not
agree
with
the
barley
wine
designation
but
other
than
the
review
was
dead
on
jason
and
todds
idea
of
putting
this
beer
down
and
ageing
it
out
is
a
good
one
i
have
a
case
for
fred
magnums
in
my
beer
cellar
just
wait
for
a
party
to
see
the
light
of
day
they
have
been
aging
for
over
two
years
pat
savage
from
hair
of
the
dog
gave
me
a
magnum
of
1999
fred
from
the
wood
which
means
it
was
aged
in
oak
notes
an
extremely
big
ale
indeed
pushing
11
5
abv
it
was
hard
to
pick
out
any
exact
hop
flavour
due
to
the
use
of
10
different
hop
varieties
try
laying
this
one
down
for
a
year
and
see
what
happens
this
brew
will
get
your
mojo
goin
perhaps
this
style
isnt
exactly
my
thing
or
the
bottle
was
off
but
i
did
not
enjoy
this
very
strong
and
overly
sweet
molten
malt
body
with
very
little
hop
presence
barrel
notes
overpowering
2010
vintage
strongly
disliked
it
smokey
with
off
flavors
flat
as
usual
with
hotd
2010
vintage
not
for
me
too
smokey
strange
flavor
smelled
pretty
good
though
not
a
big
fan
of
these
flat
beers
hotd
does
but
apparently
im
an
outlier
this
was
just
horrible
my
name
is
matt
and
i
am
embarrassed
too
much
smoke
and
not
enough
other
flavors
coming
through
i
sadly
did
not
enjoy
this
beer
i
found
it
way
too
overpowering
im
a
tobacco
chewer
and
this
is
like
having
a
chew
strong
tobacco
character
looks
great
smells
ok
tastes
like
a
chew
spitter
not
good
tastes
smokey
very
little
barrel
present
its
like
a
baltic
porter
mixed
with
an
old
ale
sweet
and
smokey
interesting
to
the
point
that
i
have
few
words
to
describe
it
but
its
an
assault
on
the
palate
in
a
bad
way
as
much
as
it
is
in
a
good
way
would
not
buy
again
for
a
while
o
another
incredible
offering
from
hotd
no
one
does
high
gravity
beers
that
age
as
gracefully
i
only
wish
i
had
another
vintage
bottle
but
im
excited
to
crack
the
2013
with
adam
from
the
wood
as
the
best
hotd
beer
ive
had
and
one
of
my
favorites
of
all
time
94
this
is
delightful
good
mellow
caramel
touch
of
smoke
pour
is
extremely
dark
brown
murky
tan
head
nose
has
olive
chocolate
malt
some
peat
and
a
light
smokiness
to
it
hints
of
caramel
and
brown
sugar
with
a
tough
of
dates
taste
is
much
more
smokey
and
peaty
almost
scotch
esq
meaty
an
salty
in
the
flavor
hints
of
the
rich
chocolate
malt
some
sweeter
berry
malt
in
back
maybe
some
iodine
in
there
body
is
full
with
soft
carb
and
creamy
feel
overall
this
is
a
very
tasty
and
different
beer
the
interesting
barrels
have
really
put
a
twist
on
this
and
its
really
nice
smoky
and
sweet
very
well
done
brew
so
glad
i
got
to
try
this
the
lack
of
carbonation
really
hurts
the
last
couple
of
categories
but
you
cant
have
everything
especially
with
hotd
i
suppose
still
a
very
good
beer
thanks
again
to
the
generous
ba
drinkability
overall
this
was
a
really
good
beer
perhaps
a
little
flat
overall
typical
hair
of
the
dog
remarkably
complex
strong
ale
that
gives
you
a
lot
to
think
about
most
certainly
one
of
the
better
strong
ales
ive
had
serving
bottle
worth
revisiting
oa
really
good
beer
extremely
complex
balance
was
good
worth
seeking
out
o
pretty
serious
brew
super
complex
but
nothing
is
overpowering
garnering
balance
with
this
high
abv
and
multiple
barrel
agings
is
a
rare
thing
but
they
pull
it
off
pretty
well
im
not
a
fan
of
smoky
beers
but
the
huge
sweetness
and
barrel
aging
has
tempered
the
smoked
malts
quite
well
dont
get
me
wrong
its
still
smoky
and
meaty
but
its
tolerable
for
me
this
one
is
very
sweet
syrupy
sweet
and
heavy
a
sipper
for
sure
dessert
beer
very
unique
overall
the
smoke
and
the
apple
brandy
are
the
stars
here
and
they
play
off
each
other
extremely
well
a
very
decadent
and
unique
beer
o
this
is
a
beer
that
i
feel
so
incredibly
fortunate
to
ever
have
to
opportunity
to
drink
my
highest
rated
beer
thus
far
it
shares
the
amazing
mellow
well
balanced
alcohol
hiding
barrel
aged
qualities
with
the
other
heavy
hitters
such
as
bcbs
but
is
far
more
flavorful
complex
and
unique
in
my
opinion
2013
was
the
clear
winner
thanks
again
to
chris
and
jeff
for
putting
this
pair
together
pours
a
murky
orangebrown
with
a
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
tiny
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
malt
smoke
and
fruit
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
slightly
sour
caramel
and
fruit
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
woody
bitterness
and
an
alcohol
kick
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
with
a
very
earthy
and
woody
set
of
aromas
and
flavors
2013
vintage
pours
a
dark
brown
almost
black
with
hardly
any
head
at
all
doesnt
look
very
carbonated
but
there
are
a
few
bubbles
on
the
side
of
the
glass
sweet
bourbon
candylike
aromas
some
woody
and
apple
notes
are
noticeable
as
well
lots
of
complexity
here
smells
absolutely
delicious
first
taste
is
insane
feels
thin
and
basically
flat
some
heat
is
obvious
along
with
delicious
bourbon
and
apple
brandy
barrel
flavors
the
finish
is
wood
and
smoke
but
somehow
in
an
incredible
way
for
me
this
beer
is
really
throwing
me
for
a
loop
as
it
is
unlike
anything
ive
had
before
but
i
am
really
enjoying
it
this
was
my
only
bottle
but
i
will
have
to
get
more
this
would
age
very
well
overall
hair
of
the
dog
has
blown
my
mind
yet
again
this
time
with
the
most
recent
release
of
matt
cant
wait
to
try
otto
cheers
overall
definitely
lives
up
to
the
hype
a
little
disappointed
that
i
couldnt
get
bottles
but
still
happy
to
be
drinking
this
definitely
worth
15
bucks
maybe
even
20
taste
holy
cow
did
not
expect
to
enjoy
it
this
much
i
knew
i
would
like
it
because
99
of
the
beer
they
make
is
fantastic
but
this
immediately
vaulted
into
my
top
5
maybe
it
was
the
3
years
of
aging
but
this
was
just
a
masterpiece
of
what
a
barrel
aged
strong
ale
can
be
sweet
but
not
too
sweet
boozy
but
not
over
the
top
almost
tastes
like
some
sort
of
sweet
liqure
blended
with
the
malt
and
hops
of
a
beer
just
nothing
like
it
the
cherry
adam
from
the
wood
had
similar
qualities
but
this
beer
did
it
without
any
added
fruit
i
now
see
why
people
were
lined
up
to
buy
cases
of
the
2013
batch
great
and
full
taste
wher
the
alcohol
is
noticable
superbeer
hair
of
the
dog
makes
some
great
beer
and
this
very
well
could
be
their
best
its
so
rich
fruity
smokey
and
delicious
that
i
cant
stop
thinking
about
it
if
you
get
any
chance
to
give
this
beer
a
try
trade
steal
or
cheat
to
get
it
thanks
again
dave
great
great
beer
as
far
as
big
sweeter
boozy
beers
go
this
is
one
of
the
best
ive
had
very
complex
and
enjoyable
as
it
warms
the
apple
really
comes
through
matts
presence
on
my
palate
is
also
huge
thick
chewy
viscous
oily
and
sticky
and
youll
be
tasting
matt
long
after
youve
swallowed
left
over
oak
booze
and
fading
dark
fruits
will
coat
your
mouth
for
days
if
you
forget
to
brush
just
an
incredible
beer
when
all
was
said
and
done
i
cant
thank
jeff
enough
for
cracking
this
one
if
i
ever
had
the
chance
id
buy
as
much
of
this
as
i
could
afford
o
not
many
beverages
out
there
can
take
this
one
in
terms
of
complexity
worth
seeking
out
and
worth
the
cost
perhaps
the
most
complex
beer
ive
ever
tasted
and
absolutely
one
of
the
best
7
210
o
this
definitely
holds
the
spot
as
most
complex
and
interesting
beer
ive
had
would
want
to
drink
it
all
the
often
but
would
certainly
have
it
again
hotd
talks
about
making
old
styles
of
ales
and
this
one
exemplifies
that
matt
really
does
taste
like
an
antique
beer
amazing
work
of
creating
complexity
and
depth
in
a
beer
o
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
so
complex
so
much
going
on
alan
sprints
needs
to
make
this
one
again
soon
cost
15
for
a
12
oz
bottle
unique
and
awesome
beer
though
not
my
favorite
from
hotd
o
this
was
an
absolutely
amazing
beer
and
another
home
run
from
hotd
overall
a
fantastic
and
very
original
beer
havent
had
aything
like
it
before
and
would
definitely
like
to
have
it
again
one
day
between
this
and
the
aftw
i
just
had
i
think
these
guys
have
redeemed
themselves
after
my
flat
doggie
claws
o
a
beer
i
had
been
wanting
to
try
for
a
very
long
time
glad
i
was
finally
able
to
do
so
an
amazing
beer
which
along
with
aftw
live
up
to
their
reputation
o
one
of
the
best
ive
had
from
hotd
an
incredible
beer
to
sip
and
savor
edit
after
having
this
one
on
tap
for
the
2013
vintage
i
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
this
is
my
favorite
beer
right
now
and
deserves
a
bump
accordingly
the
2010
vintage
pours
with
light
carbonation
into
a
murky
deep
coffeebrown
body
theres
very
little
head
but
a
pale
ring
of
lacing
what
is
remarkable
about
this
beer
is
how
the
elements
of
taste
surge
and
fade
like
voices
in
counterpoint
smells
of
sweet
bourbon
and
light
raisins
greet
the
nose
and
they
linger
over
dried
apple
and
smoke
the
taste
comes
and
goes
a
sharp
dried
apple
sweetness
a
slight
alcoholic
edge
that
pervades
a
deeper
sweetness
of
molasses
and
milk
chocolate
smoke
and
charred
oak
finishing
on
a
quiet
chocolate
astringency
the
body
is
medium
to
thick
the
beer
is
sweet
not
cloying
and
in
the
delicate
interplay
of
powerful
flavours
is
one
remarkable
beer
o
really
really
nice
stuff
the
nose
and
flavor
are
so
unique
and
come
through
nicely
definitely
a
nice
brew
that
im
extremely
glad
i
had
the
opportunity
to
try
overall
this
beer
is
awesome
i
havent
have
a
really
good
american
strong
ale
in
a
long
time
and
this
was
just
fantastic
i
have
wanted
to
try
this
beer
for
a
long
time
and
it
does
not
dissapoint
i
gotta
try
this
beer
fresh
when
ever
the
next
batch
of
matt
is
released
4
75
o
i
waited
a
while
to
drink
this
and
im
happy
i
did
it
was
everything
i
expected
it
to
be
and
its
definitely
the
best
hotd
beer
ive
had
so
far
but
i
have
yet
to
open
my
bottle
of
adam
ftw
either
way
im
thrilled
to
have
another
bottle
and
to
see
what
happens
to
this
with
some
more
age
next
time
im
drinking
this
cellar
temp
though
no
reason
at
all
to
chill
it
great
stuff
by
hotd
this
is
worth
the
hype
d
very
drinkable
really
nicely
balanced
with
lots
of
complex
flavors
coming
together
the
smoked
malts
are
a
nice
touch
overall
another
winner
from
hotd
i
have
yet
to
have
anything
other
than
world
class
beers
from
this
brewery
i
will
most
certainly
be
getting
some
more
bottles
of
matt
when
a
fresh
batch
is
released

i

probably
my
favorite
of
the
night
smoke
is
really
present
in
the
nose
but
thats
it
a
bit
in
the
taste
but
it
works
well
it
is
part
of
the
barrel
would
definitely
have
this
again
and
seek
it
out
among
the
best
beers
ive
had
really
really
tasty
stuff
if
i
could
make

jolly
rancher
this
is
what
it
would
taste
like
it
pleases
me
greatly
that
my
namesake
beer
is
so
damn
good
verdict
definitely
a
sipper
unique
blend
of
flavors
between
the
smokiness
and
fruitiness
bourbon
and
the
malt
a
great
brew
that
everyone
should
get
to
try
once
leathery

tobaccoy
smokey
malt
aroma
and
flavors
dance
around
my
senses
at
every
sip
whiff
black
licorice
and
molasses
impart
even
more
darkness
as
i
swish
in
my
mouth
boozy
warmth
throughout
creating
an
intense
bold
flavor
profile
so
creative
so
complex
and
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
o
delicious
and
wonderful
balance
between
the
elements
definite
sipper
could
use
a
tad
more
carbonation
which
along
with
the
booziness
knocks
this
a
few
points
but
delicious
nonetheless
this
is
an
absolutely
insanely
good
beer
the
level
of
complexity
is
mindboggling
its
almost
overwhelming
smooth
delectable
and
incredibly
complexgenuinely
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
o
overall
i
liked
this
one
a
lot
though
it
is
very
different
i
preferred
cherry
atfw
aftw
and
fftw
but
this
is
still
a
great
beer
id
like
to
have
again
edit
i
was
fortunate
enough
to
revisit
this
in
the
form
of
the
new
2013
release
i
must
applaud
allan
this
is
absolutely
the
same
stellar
brew
and
merits
a
slight
increase
in
the
ratings
for
consistency
o
fantastic
absolutely
fantastic
matt
pours
a
medium
bodied
sticky
dark
dark
molasses
brown
in
color
with
no
head
just
light
beige
bubbles
the
nose
on
this
one
is
complex
and
smells
like
something
ive
had
before
but
cant
out
my
finger
on
it
features
sweet
malt
molasses
maple
syrup
leather
tobacco
figs
oak
and
light
smoke
the
flavors
are
almost
identical
its
slightly
dry
so
i
get
plenty
of
spicy
tobacco
and
oak
up
front
its
followed
by
figs
plum
and
raisin
it
just
has
this
earthiness
about
it
i
really
dig
it
it
drinks
like
an
old
ale
and
doesnt
feature
any
alcohol
at
all
it
drinks
medium
in
body
and
coats
your
palate
its
really
enjoyable
this
beer
is
great
so
i
hope
it
isnt
too
difficult
to
chase
down
o
really
a
standout
beer
complex
layered
and
blended
nicely
i
would
have
given
it
a
higher
rating
if
there
was
a
little
more
carbonation
i
was
a
little
disappointed
with
the
lack
of
bourbon
i
was
able
to
pull
out
of
this
beer
overall
though
a
definite
must
try
o
a
fascinating
beer
and
oneofakind
experience
its
quite
likely
ill
never
quite
find
a
beer
like
it
the
number
of
flavors
this
thing
presents
is
incredible
and
it
strikes
a
surprisingly
impressive
balance
between
all
of
them
hop
malt
booze
all
get
their
turn
here
and
all
add
up
to
a
very
impressive
concoction
definitely
overthetop
sticky
and
cloying
so
beware
of
that
but
the
sheer
breadth
of
diversity
in
the
flavor
profile
in
this
is
awesome
not
a
perfect
beer
but
extremely
daring
and
the
results
speak
for
themselves
great
job
hotd
o
glad
i
had
the
opportunity
to
try
this
rarity
this
one
lived
up
to
the
hype
really
great
beer
and
another
good
one
from
hair
of
the
dog
i
was
worried
it
would
be
past
its
prime
but
its
still
drinking
great
hope
they
release
this
again

notes
poured
into
a
nostradamus
flute
glass
pours
dark
brown
almost
black
no
carbonation
at
all
aroma
of
dark
dried
fruit
bourbon
with
hints
of
vanilla
and
caramel
rich
complex
flavor
dominated
by
dark
fruit
dark
malts
chocolate
and
caramel
sweetness
finishes
sweet
with
some
wood
overtones
a
bit
sweet
would
have
scored
a
10
with
some
carbonation
ill
age
one
overall
its
a
fascinating
beer
i
honestly
dont
know
how
much
i
like
it
the
flavors
are
amazing
although
i
dont
know
how
well
they
go
together
unique
enough
to
really
impress
me
though
overall
another
solid
effort
from
hotd
they
tend
to
produce
beers
over
and
over
right
up
my
alley
looking
forward
to
my
adam
from
the
wood
patiently
tucked
away
in
my
cellar
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
above
medium
bodied
but
lighter
then
it
looked
carbonation
is
low
overall
it
was
a
really
good
beer
it
felt
a
little
overly
sweet
with
the
candi
sugar
at
first
as
it
warmed
though
things
really
started
coming
together
the
finish
is
where
things
really
stood
out
for
me
in
it
the
barrel
aging
slight
smoked
malt
and
balancing
bitterness
really
worked
together
well
12oz
bottle
of
the
2011
version
of
my
namesake
slight
hint
of
apples
on
the
aroma
taste
of
smoke
oak
hides
the
alcohol
remarkably
well
for
12
5
this
is
delicious
caramel
smoky
apple
bourbon
greatness
a
sipper
well
worth
the
hype
now
if
only
i
could
find
more
of
it
this
was
a
smooth
smooth
beer
to
drink
the
carbonation
was
extremely
light
this
one
is
defiantly
one
to
take
on
slowly
and
enjoy
sip
by
sip
o
well
i
know
im
really
supposed
to
like
this
beer
a
lot
but
it
just
doesnt
work
for
me
this
is
as
slow
a
sipper
as
there
can
be
this
would
work
much
better
in
a
small
small
serving
it
is
fairly
complex
with
a
host
of
sugary
sweet
flavors
to
it
but
it
is
just
too
overpowering
for
its
own
good
im
getting
thru
the
bottle
but
it
is
slow
going
i
would
not
call
this
one
of
my
favorite
american
strong
ales
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
few
taster
glasses
color
was
the
darkest
of
browns
maroon
around
the
edges
opaque
no
head
to
speak
of
although
light
swirling
produced
a
tiny
bit
of
unexpected
lacing
nice
aroma
indicative
of
the
complexity
that
id
soon
be
tasting
dark
fruits
and
lots
of
them
booze
wood
esters
thick
dark
malts
lots
of
sumptuous
dark
fruit
in
the
tasteraisins
prunes
figsno
disguising
the
booze
smooth
chocolate
lingered
into
the
aftertaste
with
hints
of
smoke
and
herbal
hops
all
things
considered
the
mouthfeel
was
amazingly
smooth
and
velvety
obviously
you
want
to
let
this
one
sit
on
the
palate
and
get
the
full
gambit
of
flavors
from
it
very
nice
and
very
savorable
i
have
a
couple
extra
bottles
of
this
that
im
going
to
let
age
for
a
while
should
be
interesting
to
see
how
they
taste
in
a
few
years
but
theyre
obviously
ready
for
consumption
now
flavors
are
a
bit
muted
so
i
suspect
this
is
a
bit
past
its
prime
would
love
to
get
a
bottle
from
the
newer
batch
to
compare
overall
this
is
a
great
of
example
of
barrel
aging
done
right
the
base
beer
is
complex
and
interesting
and
the
barrel
aging
is
done
just
long
enough
to
add
complexity
to
the
base
beer
instead
of
dominating
it
phenomenally
complex
and
enjoyable
i
hope
to
run
into
it
again
along
with
adam
and
fred
this
one
is
another
stellar
brew
from
hair
of
the
dog
a
limited
release
definitely
worth
tracking
down
thanks
again
for
the
trade
boatshoes
highly
recommended
overall
this
beer
and
parabola
really
remind
me
of
each
other
both
great
lots
of
smoky
notes
and
some
kings
of
spirits
but
not
too
much
nice
stuff
pours
a
cloudy
dark
brown
with
a
minimal
white
head
smell
is
a
fantastic
mix
of
bourbon
brandy
and
chocolate
with
hints
of
alcohol
and
dark
fruits
taste
follows
the
smell
the
brandy
and
bourbon
come
together
perfectly
and
combines
with
a
bit
of
roasted
malt
and
a
bit
of
smoke
its
sweet
but
not
overwhelmingly
so
mouthfeel
is
mediumbodied
with
minimal
carbonation
overall
this
is
really
a
great
beer
that
doesnt
really
taste
like
anything
else
out
there
probably
my
favorite
hotd
beer
thus
far
overall
exceptional
o
one
fantastic
brew
that
i
wish
came
in
a
bigger
bottle
hint
hint
overall
a
mixed
bag
aroma
and
taste
are
really
complex
and
surprising
but
the
beers
flatness
leaves
me
wishing
for
so
much
more
next
time
ill
do
a
sideside
between
matt
and
adam
the
similarities
are
pretty
obvious
beer
is
medium
in
body
really
sweet
strong
very
dry
a
little
too
dry
for
me
but
the
more
i
drink
the
more
i
like
it
strong
sweet
nice
liquor
backbone
leading
up
to
a
bitternessless
finish
that
leave
the
mouth
dry
i
would
have
liked
a
less
dry
finish
but
ultimately
this
was
good
the
beer
appears
nearly
still
and
a
dark
brown
color
the
aroma
is
nice
with
a
lot
of
booze
pepper
spice
fruit
barrels
smooth
on
the
palate
low
carbonation
with
less
booze
in
the
flavor
than
was
present
in
the
aroma
complex
and
delicious
this
one
is
a
slow
sipper
great
blend
of
bourbon
and
fruit
flavors
with
light
spice
overall
a
terrific
beer
glad
to
have
finally
tried
it
it
is
my
name
after
all
o
a
wonderful
beer
that
is
very
smooth
and
a
pleasure
to
drink
i
wish
i
had
a
whole
bottle
to
spoil
myself
with
thanks
for
sharing
mike
easy
to
sip
smooth
creamy
and
fullbodied
there
is
just
enough
carbonation
to
let
the
full
battery
of
flavors
open
up
on
the
palate
just
about
perfect
in
every
way
o
like
this
beer
a
lot
would
love
to
drink
it
regularly
when
im
in
the
mood
for
a
strong
ale
thats
been
put
in
bourbon
well
done
o
glad
to
have
tried
this
and
would
gladly
have
another
thanks
so
much
scott
o
just
a
touch
more
carbonation
and
i
cant
imagine
it
getting
any
better
very
glad
i
got
a
chance
to
try
this
one
thanks
jim
this
was
delicious
wish
i
had
some
more
overall
one
of
the
top
10
best
beer
experiences
i
can
remember
overall
very
good
beer
very
solid
and
highly
recommended
i
am
becoming
more
and
more
impressed
with
hotd
o
very
very
good
i
must
have
o
a
really
great
and
complex
but
excellently
balanced
beer
staying
on
my
wants
the
body
is
full
but
its
flat
we
really
need
some
carbonation
to
pull
this
together
overall
this
taste
great
and
smells
great
it
just
needs
some
carbonation
this
is
my
fourth
hotd
beer
and
the
second
that
has
been
flat
that
simply
dissapoints
i
like
this
a
lot
the
lacking
carbonation
might
be
very
off
putting
to
many
i
dont
seem
to
mind
it
here
an
amazing
beer
much
better
than
i
thought
it
would
be
a
great
beer
stunning
aroma
and
flavour
combine
to
provide
a
wonderful
dessert
beer
well
done
alan
now
im
going
to
drink
a
cigar
city
ba
milk
porter
by
myself
and
forget
about

a
most
generous
gift
from
inflateablechair
this
one
poured
a
murky
reddishbrown
color
with
just
a
suggestion
of
bubbles
on
top
aromas
of
red
apples
bourbon
plums
dates
and
molasses
on
the
palate
this
one
was
rich
full
bodied
and
very
nearly
still
with
flavors
of
bourbon
oak
dried
fruits
leather
and
chocolate
an
extremely
complex
and
delicious
beer
this
was
certainly
flavorful
and
complex
but
still
had
a
bit
of
rawness
to
it
from
the
barrel
that
held
this
back
a
bit
for
me
id
love
to
try
this
with
a
bit
more
age
on
it
as
ill
bet
this
one
soothes
out
nicely
it
was
still
really
awesome
that
i
was
able
to
buy
this
here
at
the
brewery
overall
i
could
easily
drink
a
few
of
these
but
my
liver
probably
would
be
upset
incredibly
complex
a
real
treat
o
im
a
wine
guy
as
well
so
i
love
a
beer
that
reminds
me
of
a
fine
port
or
brandy
love
this
beer
a
sipper
for
sure
thanks
again
eric
o
worth
every
penny
overall
wish
i
had
had
this
on
draft
its
pretty
tasty
but
not
as
good
as
id
expected
overall
proper
carbonation
would
make
this
better
and
really
send
it
into
a
different
category
as
is
the
flavor
is
pretty
good
but
it
just
does
not
have
all
the
pieces
had
this
in
a
bottle
at
the
brewery
2010
vintage
very
dark
with
no
head
his
was
very
nutty
and
caramely
it
was
worth
the
wait
and
the
money
to
sample
maybe
my
favorite
hair
of
the
dog
this
beer
would
be
a
great
way
to
relax
and
unwind
on
a
cold
night
bottle
with
a
big
high
five
to
pantanap
thanks
dude
pour
is
very
dark
opaque
brown
no
head
except
for
a
few
bubbles
looks
like
a
very
old
spirit
ugly
but
cute
at
the
same
time
i
like
it
aroma
is
definately
on
the
spiritoak
side
of
things
strong
notes
of
molasses
and
vanilla
taste
is
very
very
sweet
i
was
afraid
a
little
by
the
aroma
i
thought
we
were
on
our
way
to
a
boozy
mess
but
the
taste
is
so
boldly
sweet
with
no
off
flavors
at
all
just
a
warm
sweet
monster
sipper
lots
of
calvados
flavour
toffee
caramel
palate
is
completely
flat
good
alcohol
warmth
so
long
and
silky
in
the
mouth
i
guess
this
is
perfect
for
a
cold
winter
evening
but
it
worked
well
for
us
on
a
hot
july
afternoon
while
it
was
excellent
i
found
it
very
hard
to
drink
hence
the
lower
overall
rating
huge
thanks
to
beerzebub
for
the
overwhelming
generosity
that
he
always
shows
me
2010
bottle
the
brew
pours
a
nearstill
colabrown
hue
there
is
no
head
or
bubbles
but
the
liquid
is
viscous
enough
to
leave
slight
legs
upon
the
glass
the
look
is
rustic
and
menacing
the
nose
is
on
the
contrary
the
most
absolutely
inviting
thing
imaginable
the
complexity
is
literally
astounding
there
is
a
plethora
of
sensory
delights
to
behold
within
the
flavor
and
aroma
of
matt
notes
of
charred
brown
sugar
toffee
raisindark
fruit
cherries
hardwood
smoke
tannic
oak
buttery
vanilla
booze
leather
and
that
familiar
hotd
twang
just
to
mention
the
most
prominent
associations
all
make
for
a
very
familiar
set
of
elements
but
they
are
combined
here
in
an
unusual
and
novel
way
the
feel
is
more
lively
than
the
look
suggests
and
is
quite
silky
as
well
overall
this
is
far
and
away
the
best
hotd
brew
ive
had
and
that
is
saying
something
because
ive
had
some
great
ones
lives
up
to
any
and
all
hype
it
is
still
very
much
a
sipper
but
one
that
is
quickly
disappearing
from
my
glass
hair
of
the
dog
has
my
attention
already
but
i
think
this
is
their
best
beer
i
have
had
so
far
easily
my
most
favorite
strong
ale
to
date
absolutely
spectacular
drink
to
be
able
to
try
both
at
one
time
i
was
very
happy
thick
boozy
tastefully
balanced
and
well
done
a
great
beer
so
many
complexities
i
can
only
hope
ill
get
the
chance
to
drink
this

adam
ftw
incredible
i
dont
believe
ive
ever
had
a
barrelaged
smoked
beer
before
but
i
love
it
the
smoke
is
perfect
and
smooth
like
the
aroma
left
in
your
clothes
after
a
good
cigar
looks
like
im
going
to
have
to
get
some
more
matt
this
beer
really
does
not
disappoint
its
one
of
the
best
that
ive
had
in
a
long
time
and
it
was
worth
the
wait
the
smell
was
full
of
complex
aromas
super
sweet
caramel
toffee
prunes
figs
leather
alcohol
malty
bourbon
oak
apple
and
vanilla
the
taste
was
as
rich
as
the
nose
initially
i
was
in
a
wash
of
sweet
dark
sugary
ambrosia
which
was
quickly
balanced
out
by
the
sharp
alcohol
dark
fruit

lingering

finish
mouthfeel
was
slick
low

and
full

my
fears
of
a
2011
caftwletdown
were
quickly
quashed
after
a
couple
drinks
this
was
a
real
pleasure
to
drink
and
having
just
finished
my
glass
im
sure
im
going
to
try
to
chase
another
one
of
these
down
in
the
future
having
had
a
couple
vintages
of
caftw
and
fftw
this
is
the
best
hotd
offering
ive
had
the
opportunity
to
drink
o
i
love
hotd
but
i
was

down

great
balance
between

components
and
the

itself
while
this

the
lack
of

made
the

the

i
would
easily
want
to
drink
this
again
with
a
hope
of
better
carbonation
o
i
am
proud
that
a
beer
that
carries
my
name
does
not
suck
and
is
in
fact
actually
pretty
awesome
im
glad
i
have
more
bottles
to
open
on
a
special
occasion
fantastic
beer
overall
hair
of
the
dog
is
a
personal
favorite
and
this
does
not
disappoint
given
the
price
tag
and
relative
rarity
of
this
id
reach
for
adam
more
frequently
my
god
i
love
that
beer
but
this
is
a
real
treat
o
i
dont
know
how
many
of
these
you
could
drink
or
afford
to
drink
totally
worth
seeking
though
quite
unique
o
meh
consumed
on
03172011
this
is
a
full
bodied
brew
with
a
light
enjoyable
level
of
carbonation
big
abv
factor
that
does
not
attempt
to
be
hidden
i
forsee
this
brew
becoming
increasingly
enjoyable
as
time
passes
the
alcohol
at
this
point
is
very
warming
fusel
and
seemingly
evaporative
on
the
tongue
yet
it
is
quite
enjoyable
this
brew
was
not
at
all
what
i
expected
but
it
was
very
enjoyable
nonethelss
an
amazing
beer
a
great
sipper
and
so
complex
like
a
fine
winesherry
i
am
so
glad
i
got
to
try
this
again
highly
recommended
what
to
say
about
this
beer
it
has
reminded
me
why
i
love
hair
of
the
dog
so
much
just
a
very
complex
and
well
done
beer
that
i
wish
i
had
a
lot
more
of
o
an
interesting
and
complex
brew
with
the
double
barrel
treatment
i
think
its
probably
best
fresh
though
this
is
now
one
of
my
atf
o
incredible
so
many
great
distinct
flavors
that
combine
in
total
harmony
with
one
another
every
little
sip
goes
a
very
long
way
packing
gobs
of
delicious
flavors
great
warming
feel
in
my
stomach
as
i
savor
each
sip
i
love
this
beer
i
would
definitely
drink
a
glass
of
this
before
going
to
sleep
every
night
if
i
could
this
is
heaven
in
a
glass
what
more
can
be
said
please
keep
brewing
this
alan
i
want
more
o
probably
the
best
hotd
beer
that
ive
had
to
date
matt
is
really
impressive
incredible
taste
and
solid
in
every
other
aspect
this
one
is
definitely
worth
seeking
out
the
taste
and
smell
were
outstanding
but
the
appearance
and
mouthfeel
were
pretty
poor
overall
a
good
beer
but
not
something
i
would
go
crazy
looking
for
in
the
future
o
overall
this
is
a
very
unique
beer
i
enjoyed
the
originality
of
it
but
im
doubt
i
will
seek
it
out
again
bottle
shared
by
miketd
thanks
mike
for
sharing
this
one
pours
black
with
no
head
aromas
are
complex
with
oak
vanilla
brown
sugar
and
some
dark
fruit
heavy
mouthfeel
with
little
carbonation
flavor
is
wood
wine
apple
candi
sugar
sweetness
licorice
and
finishes
with
some
alcohol
a
very
nice
brew
and
worth
the
hype
thanks
mike
for
sharing
what
a
beer
truly
unlike
any
ive
had
before
this
is
probably
my
favorite
barrelaged
hotd
offering
to
date
its
not
without
its
flaws
but
its
a
decadent
beer
fit
for
commemorating
whatever
you
have
worth
commemorating
truth
be
told
i
struggled
to
finish
the
bottle
its
a
bit
cloying
rich
and
drinks
hot
enough
to
warrant
splitting
overall
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
of
the
last
year
or
two
i
actually
do
want
another
one
but
i
also
dont
want
to
be
hungover
tomorrow
so
i
will
reluctantly
abstain
o
delicious
i
like
the
aroma
better
than
the
taste
i
really
like
the
evergreen
smoke
notes
this
beer
was
pretty
off
putting
to
me
initially
but
as
it
came
to
room
temp
it
really
opened
up
tasty
beer
i
enjoyed
the
bottle
of
the
new
batch
more
not
sure
if
its
the
age
or
batch
variation
thanks
again

dthe
depth
of
flavor
is
there
but
its
too
boozy
hurts
the
drinkability
considerably
though
this
is
still
something
everyone
should
try
i
get
the
impression
this
is
better
fresh
o
well
im
glad
to
say
i
have
ticked
this
bad
boy
and
the
bottleworks
version
of
it
at
that
i
just
expected
more
from
it
people
talk
up
a
lot
of
beers
and
this
just
adds
to
the
list
of
disappointments
oh
well
it
was
worth
trying
d
this
is
good
even
at
11
5
i
would
definitely
like
another
glass
courtesy
of
daknole
pours
near
black
with
great
aroma
of
bourbon
and
some
fruit
taste
was
sweet
with
noticeable
alcohol
full
bodied
and
delicious
thanks
dak
this
was
a
real
treat
id
been
wanting
to
try
this
for
quite
a
while
and
dak
comes
through
d
an
intensely
interesting
beer
that
leads
to
a
deeply
visceral
experience
at
first
i
wasnt
quite
sure
the
flavors
meshed
well
for
me
but
after
sifting
through
layer
after
layer
and
enjoying
it
as
it
warms
i
have
to
say
its
up
there
with
some
of
the
most
interesting
beers
i
have
had
the
chance
to
taste
drinkability
drinkability
maybe
im
just
growing
curmudgeonly
in
my
old
beer
age
this
beer
straddles
a
very
interesting
divide
showcasing
both
deep
smoky
dark
toastiness
as
well
as
bright
green
fruity
overtones
as
a
genreblending
experiment
it
succeeds
ive
never
had
a
beer
quite
like
this
to
be
sure
and
not
to
sell
it
short
it
succeeds
on
several
other
levels
too
least
of
which
is
the
divine
nose
and
the
masterful
blending
and
complexity
of
the
mouth
but
i
still
require
lift
head
lace
et
al
this
one
had
its
procedural
defects
and
though
theyre
not
glaring
they
do
take
their
toll
it
was
a
little
difficult
to
finish
those
essentially
flat
final
few
sips
of
course
all
that
being
said
this
was
still
a
pretty
damn
awesome
beer
its
not
every
day
youre
going
to
get
this
many
flavors
and
aromas
out
of
a
single
12
oz
bottle
heres
three
years
late
to
bottleworks
10th
anniversary
and
to
hotd
for
a
great
brew
pours
a
slightly
translucent
dark
brown
smells
of
sweet
figs
boozy
raisins
and
a
small
amount
of
hops
a
bit
of
smoke
and
maybe
a
touch
of
apple
round
it
out
one
of
the
more
complex
noses
on
a
beer
i
have
had
the
taste
is
a
crazy
combination
of
mild
hops
or
other
bitterness
rum
raisins
dark
fruit
smoke
apple
booze
and
vanilla
a
lot
going
on
in
there
feels
like
i
could
keep
sipping
it
and
get
more
flavors
really
heavy
in
the
mouth
with
limited
carbonation
definitely
a
sipper
this
is
either
a
good
sharing
beer
or
a
beer
to
be
enjoyed
in
front
of
a
fire
slowly
on
a
cold
night
d
a
bottle
of
this
is
plenty
but
a
real
pleasure
to
drink
sort
of
wish
i
would
have
traded
for
more
than
one
drinkability
is
very
good
definitely
a
big
beer
but
i
could
sip
on
this
all
night
im
amazed
at
how
well
it
is
already
drinking
not
sure
how
long
ill
be
able
to
keep
my
other
bottle
in
the
cellar
a
perfect
beer
for
a
cold
winters
night
hotd
has
created
a
masterpiece
if
you
like
stong
ales
old
ales
barleywines
etc
this
beer
is
a
must
overall
i
really
enjoy
this
one
wish
i
had
a
whole
bunch
of
them
d
this
is
a
big
time
sipper
full
of
absolutely
delicious
flavors
and
thick
full
chewiness
perhaps
one
of
my
favorite
beers
lately
absolutely
world
class
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
coats
the
whole
mouth
there
is
next
to
no
carbonation
but
its
not
really
needed
this
is
incredibly
smooth
definitely
a
sipper
and
a
challenging
beer
almost
more
of
a
spirit
than
a
beer
very
nice
and
i
hope
to
be
able
to
try
it
again
someday
flavor
is
extremely
sweet
and
fruity
with
a
stronger
smoke
presence
than
the
aroma
which
gives
the
finish
a
light
spiciness
mouthfeel
is
very
lightly
carbonated
with
a
thick
velvety
lush
mouthfeel
bordering
on
syrup
like
vanilla
and
brandy
dominate
the
sweetness
in
the
front
of
the
palate
and
the
freshness
of
this
bottle
is
apparent
in
the
finish
in
its
booziness
give
this
another
year
and
itll
be
perfect
dquite
strong
very
nice
and
certainly
tasty
alcohol
heat
does
become
present
and
noticeable
upon
warming
final
thoughts
a
beer
to
remember
expertly
crafted
by
alan
sprints
better
than
cherry
adam
i
wish
it
was
as
readily
available
as
adam
i
could
drink
it
every
day
this
is
really
yummy
surprised
this
lived
up
to
the
hype
track
this
down
love
it
fresh
and
cant
wait
to
try
to
aged
d
this
is
certainly
a
sipper
and
having
split
it
with
2
others
was
perfect
would
i
drink
another
yes
but
on
a
different
night
planning
on
aging
one
for
a
year

the
barrel
aging
and
bottle
conditioning
gave
this
world
class
beer
a
really
sublime
feel
the
apples
were
mellowed
and
the
brown
sugar
had
subsided
my
observation
at
the
bottom
of
the
glass
this
is
a
beer
worth
waiting
in

to
buy
says
it

previous

a
great
brew
worthy
of
the
hype
and
the
hotd
label
complex
and
certainly
to
be
savored
poured
this
12oz
bottle
into
large
wine
glass
it
poured
a
blackish
purple
with
almost
no
head
retention
only
a
little
bit
of
non
sticky
lacing
the
smell
was
overwhelming
in
a
good
way
lots
of
apple
dark
fruits
pepper
sherry
and
alcohol
this
is
an
incredibly
complex
beer
with
many
different
flavors
to
pick
up
dark
fruits
currants
raisins
plum
green
apples
very
strong
tobacco
and
smoke
vanilla
cherries
and
pleasantly
black
licorice
this
medium
to
heavier
body
beer
had
alcoholic
heat
with
a
slick
and
semi
dry
mouthfeel
this
beer
is
going
to
get
even
better
with
some
age
on
it
and
im
looking
forward
to
it
a
delicious
complex
brew
in
closing
if
you
can
get
this
beer
grab
some
and
cellar
it
for
the
next
few
years
to
come
this
beer
beats
the
pants
off
of
other
big
beers
ive
tried
like
dark
lord
darkness
firestone

etc
d
what
an
insanely
wonderful
beer
im
sitting
on
some
more
for
a
later
date
if
this
turns
into
what
the
bwx
vintage
did
its
an
intoxicating
treat
to
look
forward
too
and
watch
progress
if
you
can
get
only
one
bottle
of
hotd
beer
matt
is
the
one
try
it
if
you
can

drinkability
great
it
doesnt
feel
so
heavy
right
now
at
this
stage
the
lighter
thinner
feel
makes
it
easier
to
drink
but
you
will
probably
be
able
to
get
more
nuances
once
you
let
it
settle
for
a
while
both
are
still
wonderful
matt
is
wonderful
a
near
black
pour
with
a
thin
khaki
head
smelled
of
booze
and
smoked

soft
low

with
a
red
meat
character
dark

and
big
cherry
and

update
831
i
have
not
stopped
thinking
about
this
beer
since
i
drank
it
originally
i
submitted
a
4
2
a
rating
changed
the
drinkability
to
a
5
on
this
update
but
i
want
to
stress
that
the
only
reason
this
didnt
get
an
a
was
the
lack
of
carbonation
the
flatness
played
a
factor
in
every
characteristic
of
the
beer
but
what
i
drank
unquestionably
had
the
potential
to
be
one
of
the
best
beers
ever
to
grace
my
lips
i
now
have
a
couple
more
bottles
that
i
will
crack
down
the
line
and
i
am
holding
out
hope
that
one
of
them
has
even
a
smidgen
of
carbonation
so
i
can
experience
the
true
beauty
of
this
beer
drinkability
what
an
amazing
beer
to
try
complex
unimaginable
creative
one
of
the
more
memorable
beers
ive
had
d
not
meant
to
be
consumed
in
excess
this
beer
is
exactly
as
drinkable
as
it
ought
to
be
sip
appreciate
and
lose
yourself
in
this
masterfullycrafted
brew
d
this
is
a
perfect
special
occasion
beer
i
slightly
prefer
cherry
adam
to
this
one
but
matt
is
definitely
up
there
this
has
been
aging
at
55
degrees
since
the
release
and
it
continues
to
improve
displaying
a
beautiful
balance
of
apple
brandy
leather
smoke
chocolate
and
tobacco
this
is
aging
wonderfully
hv
taste
is
very
sharp
an
pretty
boozy
with
a
sweet
finish
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
syrupy
quite
tasty
and
drinkable
though
j
overall
this
was
an
incredibly
complex
beer
with
so
much
going
on
at
the
same
time
it
is
a
single
cohesive
brew
that
is
the
epitome
of
barrel
aging
and
blending
this
is
easily
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
ever
had
and
is
worth
the
hype
i
will
for
sure
have
another
the
next
time
im
in
seattle
oak
molasses
smokey
apples
chocolate
vanilla
toffee
caramel
an
old
ale
at
its
finest
thanks
alex
d
i
was
very
tempted
to
drink
brynas
4oz
before
she
got
home
this
is
one
of
the
few
hair
of
the
dog
beers
where
i
actually
could
down
a
whole
bottle
on
my
own
the
year
has
done
wonders
to
take
the
boozy
edge
of
this
and
none
of
the
potentially
overbearing
flavors
get
out
of
control
highly
recommended
d
this
beer
is
great
hair
of
the
dog
knocks
another
one
out
of
the
park
this
beer
both
times
i
have
had
it
has
been
divine
it
is
a
smooth
sipper
and
i
could
drink
on
it
all
night
like
that
after
reading
some
of
the
earlier
reviews
i
think
the
year
in
the
bottle
has
really
done
good
for
the
hotness
of
this
one
while
their
was
a
good
amount
of
boozy
flavors
from
the
bourbon
and
apple
brandy
it
didnt
come
off
as
just
alcohol
the
spirits
seemed
well
defined
flavorful
and
were
very
enjoyable
overall
this
was
really
unique
and
impressive
with
so
much
layered
complexity
heres
to
10
more
years
the
smell
alone
is
sublime
projecting
notes
of
apple
cured
chewing
tobacco
cherries
port
wine
and
plum
the
flavor
blends
notes
of
licorice
fig
vanilla
molasses
and
woodsmoke
while
a
distant
glow
of
alcohol
adds
an
ideal
measure
of
heat
just
the
thought
of
this
exotic
and
seductive
motor
oilblack
ale
has
me
drifting
into
a
state
of
beer
bliss
i
cant
imagine
how
high
the
gravity
must
have
been
to
ferment
out
at
11
5
abv
while
still
retaining
a
plush
body
and
considerable
sweetness
but
this
is
a
rock
solid
beer
that
exceeds
ordinary
comparisons
its
pure
magic
having
said
that
the
complexity
is
there
and
this
would
make
for
a
really
nice
sipper
very
low
carbonation
but
not
flat
medium
bodied
with
a
good
substance
to
it
both
the
booze
and
flavor
profile
command
small
sips
oh
yeah
and
the
price
tag
and
its
availability
glad
i
got
to
try
it
but
probably
wont
seek
it
out
again
in
the
future
i
bet
it
will
age
nicely
though
hair
of
the
dog
comes
up
with
some
great
ales
pours
very
dark
with
a
small
but
significant
offwhite
head
and
there
is
lace
down
the
glass
the
aroma
of
classier
bourbon
wafts
and
it
is
rich
and
strong
as
is
the
mouthfeel
a
great
drinking
ale
with
good
chocolate
coconut
and
vanilla
accumulates
in
the
tastebuds
bourbon
and
a
tad
of
sugar
in
the
aftertaste
that
is
somewhat
drying
the
taste
is
hot
with
a
boozy
burning
finish
it
has
some
brandy
like
warmth
to
it
slight
cherry
like
acidity
as
well
as
licorice
maple
and
some
subtle
smoke
on
the
palate
its
very
lowly
carbonated
and
has
a
syrupy
liqueur
type
consistency
and
an
over
the
top
burn
from
the
alcohol
i
didnt
feel
like
finishing
my
sample
so
i
shared
it
with
people
who
appreciated
it
more
phew
this
one
is
hot
and
strong
no
such
thing
as
balance
in
matt
44

yum
i
will
definitely
be
seeking
this
out
again
d
matts
got
a
lot
going
on
including
plenty
of
malt
goodness
and
a
pleasant
toasted
coconut
character
that
took
me
by
surprise
good
stuff
fo
sho
the
scent
and
taste
on
this
are
near
world
class
theres
this
funky
milkiness
that
adds
to
the
awesomeness
of
this
one
theres
a
beautiful
cola
taste
alright
i
need
to
cut
to
the
chase
theres
in
an
incredibly
unique
smokey
characteristic
that
is
excuse
my
ebonics
da
bomb
the
bourbon
notes
are
phenomenal
truely
magnificent
so
smooth
with
that
crunchy
caramel
flavor
lovely
vanilla
and
light
apple
brandy
tastes
make
this
beer
both
one
of
a
kind
and
amazing
i
wish
i
had
more
had
this
at
the
acbf
in
boston
as
a
share
from
someone
cool
after
the
event
let
out
wish
i
could
remember
who
shared
it
but
thanks
nice
flavor
and
was
to
be
expected
from
hotd
nice
smoke
malt
presence
and
flavors
from
belgian
yeast
coming
through
malty
and
sweet
and
a
dangerous

stuff
d
very
interesting
idea
and
probably
will
get
better
down
the
road
but
this
is
almost
a
mess
very
tasty
flavors
that
are
being
covered
up
by
the
raw
alcohol
wouldnt
have
guessed
11
5
from
the
nose
but
it
actually
seems
like
more
in
the
taste
i
actually
warmed
up
to
the
beer
a
bit
more
the
more
that
i
drank
the
alcohol
mellows
a
touch
as
it
opens
up
further
and
you
get
a
bit
of
raw
meaty
smoked
meat
flavor
in
the
back
adding
some
nice
depth
mix
that
with
the
wood
the
beer
pours
the
expected
dark
brown
color
with
good
head
retention
and
lacing
the
nose
is
as
intense
on
tap
as
it
was
out
of
the
bottle
with
prunes
apple
brandy
licorice
chocolate
and
coffee
as
the
beer
warmed
i
really
think
they
were
serving
this
beer
too
cold
at
brouwers
i
got
additional
chocolate
as
well
as
some
more
apple
and
vanilla
flavors
replicate
the
nose
except
this
beer
really
smoothed
out
and
became
very
creamy
after
it
warmed
a
bit
i
actually
found
it
a
bit
astringent
and
angular
initially
but
with
time
and
warming
the
beer
dramatically
improved
as
with
the
bottle
version
the
mouthfeel
is
very
rich
and
full
and
was
just
exceptional
once
it
warmed
a
bit
drinkability
is
pretty
good
though
the
alcohol
and
sweetmess
really
make
this
a
sipper
also
after
having
this
both
in
bottle
and
on
tap
i
really
think
this
beer
needs
time
to
show
its
very
best
its
delicious
now
but
i
think
in
a
year
or
two
will
turn
into
a
real
gem
regardless
this
is
a
very
impressive
beer
from
hotd
bottle
sample
shared
by
alexsdad06
poured
a
hazy
brown
color
with
an
average
offwhite
frothy
head
that
mostly
lasted
with
fair
lacing
heavy
woody
pine
citrus
and
dark
fruit
aroma
medium
to
full
body
with
smooth
texture
and
soft
carbonation
heavy
bittersweet
flavor
with
a
heavy
complex
bittersweet
finish
of
medium
to
long
duration
standout
complex
brew
i
never
wanted
this
beer
to
end
astounding
stuff
one
of
my
all
time
favorites
if
you
have
the
chance
its
worth
the
effort
of
tracking
this
one
down
sweetish
boozy
and
strong
a
real
sipper
smooth
medium
body
thats
not
overly
heavy
just
an
incredibly
tasty
brew
that
is
a
great
treat
and
thanks
to
scott
for
graciously
sharing
this
one
at
a
tasting
at
my
house
would
love
to
have
it
again
someday
one
of
the
better
beers
ive
every
tried
what
i
really
like
is
just
the
style
with
the
barrel
aging
and
the
complexity
and
depth
of
the
beer
the
apple
comes
throgh
with
some
berry
type
flavors
a
lingering
smokiness
and
chewy
caramel
date
nougat
on
the
forever
finish
hints
of
milk
chocolate
red
currant
pitted
fruits
and
a
bit
of
toffee
thick
and
creamy
and
oh
so
delicious
alan
sprints
is
the
shit
drinkability
is
somewhat
iffy
d
tough
call
here
an
amazing
brew
replete
with
varied
flavors
and
tantalizing
aromas
will
i
have
this
again
fortunately
yes
will
i
place
this
in
my
upper
echelon
of
must
trys
certainly
is
it
drinkable
well
thats
debatable
definitely
a
wonderful
sipper
but
a
few
ounces
go
a
long
way
find
a
lover
of
fine
beer
and
share
a
bottle
overall
this
is
a
phenomenal
beer
hope
i
get
a
chance
to
try
it
again

brian
overall
a
very
impressive
and
unique
beer
from
hotd
a
very
tasty
barrel
aged
concoction
love
the
barrel
profiles
and
the
mouthfeel
is
just
incredible
i
really
would
love
to
have
a
few
more
of
these
but
one
cellared
bottle
will
have
to
suffice
for
now
i
think
this
one
definitely
has
great
aging
potential
if
you
have
the
opportunity
to
get
your
hands
on
some
of
this
beer
get
a
few
excellent
beer
bottle
pours
brown
with
no
head
aroma
of
bourbon
oak
and
rich
malt
flavor
of
sweet
apple
bourbon
and
roasted
malt
i
dont
get
chocolate
or
smoke
decent
but
not
great
to
me
palate
is
a
little
light
despite
the
bourbon
this
beer
is
as
i
had
expected
it
to
begood
but
not
as
great
as
the
hype
suggests
12
ounce
bottle
acquired
in
a
trade
with
suzygreenberg
thanks
again
for
sending
me
this
one
ben
also
had
this
on
tap
in
may
poured
by
alan
himself
at
the
brewery
reviewed
from
notes
poured
into
my
dogfish
head
snifter
color
is
a
nice
dark
brown
with
some
dark
red
around
the
edges
12
inch
creamy
light
tan
head
sticks
around
for
a
few
minutes
some
lacing
at
first
aroma
is
amazing
and
consists
of
lots
of
oak
booze
including
both
brandy
and
bourbon
green
apples
roasted
caramelized
malts
vanilla
cream
bourbon
brown
sugar
light
cocoa
honey
and
an
unbelievable
toffee
scent
begins
with
a
mellow
boozy
flavor
mixed
with
smokiness
and
some
candied
fruits
mildly
roasted
malts
in
the
middle
with
some
of
the
apple
flavor
coming
through
great
brandylike
finish
that
is
warm
but
not
hot
lots
of
vanilla
and
chocolate
following
closely
behind
aftertaste
lingers
with
a
great
amount
of
oak
warms
up
with
molasses
and
complexity
with
different
fruits
coming
to
the
surface
love
the
finish
on
this
beer
warming
slightly
sweet
roasty
creamy
and
malty
mouthfeel
super
complex
medium
to
full
bodied
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
which
was
on
the
softer
side
taste
lingered
for
up
to
ten
minutes
at
times
great
aftertaste
drank
this
whole
bottle
quite
easily
but
do
not
know
how
much
more
i
could
really
do
alcohol
is
hidden
very
well
considering
what
this
is
and
the
booze
that
are
present
are
not
super
hot
but
more
complimentary
very
smooth
nice
sipper
and
i
cannot
wait
to
have
another
next
winter
this
is
one
of
the
best
hair
of
the
dog
beers
yet
and
that
is
saying
a
lot
makes
adam
even
better
than
it
already
is
i
look
forward
to
seeing
how
this
cellars
highly
recommended
its
a
complex
beer
but
id
be
lying
if
i
said
the
dominant
characteristic
right
now
isnt
an
alcohol
heat
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
thick
but
it
needs
carbonation
drinkability
suffers
as
a
result
well
when
you
take
one
of
my
favorite
beers
adam
and
start
playing
around
with
it
you
start
to
wonder
if
they
should
just
not
mess
with
a
good
thing
well
in
this
case
the
end
product
is
a
nearperfect
beer
that
has
a
complexity
that
is
unrivaled
by
almost
anything
else
out
there
world
class
d
a
sipper
for
sure
but
i
do
like
this
one
i
dont
know
if
ill
try
to
score
another
through
trades
because
im
disappointed
that
its
basically
flat
overall
a
big
big
winner
here
this
was
quite
simply
one
of
the
best
of
the
style
i
have
ever
had
not
even
a
touch
hot
either
this
one
will
surely
live
up
to
the
hype
for
anyone
who
can
track
it
down
12
ounce
bottle
in
a
snifter
pour
is
dark
opaque
brown
with
zero
head
the
liquid
is
viscous
enough
to
cling
nicely
to
the
sides
of
my
glass
though
the
noise
features
quite
a
bit
of
smoke
in
the
background
i
can
pick
out
some
oak
tobacco
and
a
bit
of
the
apple
brandy
the
flavor
is
pretty
complex
and
i
can
easily
say
that
ive
never
tasted
anything
quite
like
it
you
get
plenty
of
smoke
smooth
oaky
vanilla
and
wonderful
apple
brandy
the
mouthfeel
is
full
and
viscus
but
for
the
most
part
flat
matt
is
great
but
i
really
with
he
was
carbonated
for
a
beer
that
has
a
fairly
middling
aroma
to
it
the
flavor
has
turned
out
to
be
quite
nice
this
is
definitely
a
sipping
brew
and
i
am
really
enjoying
the
rich
concentrated
fruitiness
here
that
is
just
supported
by
roast
malt
notes
and
a
hint
of
smokiness
after
a
slow
start
this
ends
up
being
quite
an
enjoyable
brew
taste
mouthfeel
big
juicy
apple
flavor
with
bourbony
vanilla
and
caramel
right
beside
it
flavors
of
maple
syrup
smoke
caramelized
sugar
and
tobacco
appear
midpalate
fairly
hot
but
pleasantly
so
with
a
rich
full
body
smokysweet
finish
remarkable
complexity
on
display
here
and
im
amazed
at
how
harmonious
it
tastes
given
the
unusual
blend
of
apple
eau
de
vie
and
bourbon
barrels
with
such
a
smoky
base
beer
my
new
favorite
hair
of
the
dog
beer
i
would
not
drink
more
than
one
bottle
in
a
sitting
definitely
a
sipper
but
it
is
an
excellent
beer
that
i
would
love
to
revisit
i
think
this
beer
would
get
better
and
better
with
time
and
i
would
love
to
try
it
after
a
few
years
in
a
cellar
a
great
beer
but
just
short
of
spectacular
perhaps
some
age
could
do
it
but
unfortunately
i
will
probably
never
find
out
d
a
very
nice
sipper
complexity
increases
as
it
warms
up
an
allaround
very
good
brew
matt
is
an
absolute
mindblower
especially
if
youre
into
big
american
strong
ales
thanks
to
my
main
hotd
hookup
msubulldog25
for
looking
out
for
me
yet
again
cheers
brian
aroma
is
strongest
of
apples
both
sweet
and
tart
some
tart
apples
and
hay
as
well
as
some
sweet
apple
pie
with
spices
brandy
like
booziness
in
the
aroma
as
well
strong
deep
chocolate
and
some
yeastiness
in
the
aroma
as
well
taste
is
very
strong
of
apple
brandy
absolutely
delicious
the
apples
mix
with
sweet
chocolate
up
front
though
the
chocolate
keeps
more
to
the
background
some
spices
come
in
mid
taste
cinnamon
the
brandy
takes
the
fore
front
in
the
finish
with
a
nice
spicy
peppery
heat
on
the
tongue
and
throat
with
some
wood
and
oak
notes
mouthfeel
is
fairly
full
the
sweetness
would
be
somewhat
cloying
if
not
for
the
apple
and
the
heat
low
carbonation
spicy
peppery
alcohol
on
the
tongue
and
a
drying
finish
extraordinary
beer
unique
flavors
that
come
together
very
well
not
sure
if
this
was
done
partly
in
brandy
barrels
but
the
apple
brandy
flavor
is
strong
and
very
nice
cant
wait
to
see
what
some
age
does
to
this
as
it
mellows
and
the
flavors
have
time
to
blend
together
d
despite
the
abv
and
intensity
of
the
flavors
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
for
me
im
glad
they
put
this
in
12oz
bottle
though
d
not
sure
since
im
only
having
half
a
bottle
but
this
is
terrific
a
dessert
beer
and
one
of
the
better
brews
ive
had
drinkability
really
interesting
flavor
profile
very
creative
and
certainly
an
exceptional
beer
just
wish
there
was
a
bit
more
carbonation
mouthfeel
is
heavy
bodied
and
powerful
but
nearly
flat
drinkability
very
good
i
drank
it
a
little
young
would
love
to
try
it
with
a
few
years
to
it
very
enjoyable
but
it
drinks
very
slowly
a
beer
to
contemplate
overall
wow
what
a
brew
it
was
easy
for
me
to
drink
despite
being
young
with
a
high
abv
had
to
pick
up
two
more
of
these
after
having
tried
one
its
worth
the
price
and
the
effort
with
age
it
will
be
a
masterpiece
bravo
drinkability
is
very
high
as
its
a
fantastic
beer
in
spite
of
it
being
a
rare
expensive
one
off
it
goes
down
very
easy
and
if
i
lived
by
browers
id
be
drinking
it
until
it
was
gone
wow
this
beer
is
amazing
totally
worth
the
drive
up
to
seattle
i
wonder
how
much
more
amazing
this
will
get
with
a
few
more
months
or
even
a
year
or
two
on
it
but
it
is
just
amazing
now
what
an
icredible
brew
i
need
more
like
every
hotd
beer
this
is
burly
as
hell
sweet
but
complex
and
quite
the
sipper
well
played
for
a
catchall
style
this
is
hard
to
beat
pour
is
a
murky
pale
brown
with
no
head
nose
is
strong
bourbon
and
wood
with
a
good
bit
of
caramel
and
some
hints
of
dark
fig
and
fruits
nose
is
more
sweet
less
bourbon
caramel
and
lots
of
toffee
a
bit
of
slightly
charred
wood
and
notes
of
bourbon
flavors
are
a
bit
more
muted
than
the
nose
full
bodied
sticky
and
chewy
with
virtually
no
carbonation
and
a
soft
clean
finish
o
dont
smell
it
taste
it
and
youll
be
happy
o
this
is
deep
and
interesting
and
complex
but
is
not
very
good
i
would
give
it
another
try
but
as
is
its
awfully
disappointing
o
overall
a
very
nice
beer
a
boozy
sipper
by
the
fire
o
overall
still
quite
good
but
perhaps
the
weakest
of
the
fred
variations
a
case
where
barrel
aging
doesnt
help
the
beer
and
perhaps
takes
away
some
of
its
finest
nuances
the
original
fred
was
the
top
of
my
list
tasting
these
in
succession
tasting
separately
or
betweenbehindin
front
of
other
beers
who
knows
may
change
the
impression
but
fred
fftw
bfftw
progression
took
a
bit
away
each
time
and
i
dont
believe
it
to
be
from
reduced
coherency
despite
the
10
10
12
strengths
of
these
beers
regular
fred
was
supremely
balanced
and
this
almost
by
default
had
to
diminish
from
there
all
are
great
beers
but
this
bfftw
is
the
least
balanced
and
least
flawlessmost
flawed
of
the
bunch
worthy
of
a
sample
for
sure
but
the
original
fred
for
me
is
the
way
to
go
in
the
future
rarity
doesnt
pay
off
in
this
series
o
as
always
an
amazing
beer
from
hotd
they
are
one
of
my
favorites
and
although
this
beer
is
flat
i
feel
thats
the
least
of
my
concerns
when
it
taste
this
good
pretty
onedimensional
and
abrasive
fresh
however
delicious
interested
to
see
how
it
ages
also
the
sweet
maple
syrup
component
is
interested
given
no
additive
overall
an
enjoyable
sipper
that
was
fine
for
a
cold
winters
evening
but
it
was
almost
too
sweet
the
hint
of
whiskey
kept
it
somewhat
balanced
from
the
sweetness
this
would
be
good
to
split
with
someone
would
like
to
revisit
it
again
when
its
properly
carbonated
overall
this
is
just
another
example
of
an
extremely
complex
beer
from
hotd
i
can
imagine
there
being
a
lot
of
differing
opinions
about
this
one
this
is
not
up
to
the
level
that
you
would
think
overall
very
nice
despite
lack
of
carbonation
thanks
again
phil
long
finish
o
amazing
that
the
flavors
and
their
delivery
did
not
suffer
from
the
lack
of
carbonation
does
not
taste
like
12
at
all
excellent
beer
but
id
love
to
try
a
carbonated
version
overall
would
have
looked
if
it
had
conserved
its
carbonation
but
overall
the
flavor
makes
up
for
it
o
if
this
beer
were
actually
carbonated
it
would
be
fantastic
even
without
the
carbonation
it
is
still
a
great
beer
with
nice
complexity
a
very
good
drinkability
and
fantastic
nose
while
this
beer
isnt
overpoweringly
sweet
or
cloying
it
should
be
recommended
as
a
dessert
beer
even
being
flat
i
would
recommend
anyone
who
loves
sweet
complex
beers
to
try
this
out
2011
darker
blondorange
with
almost
no
head
very
undercarbonated
smell
is
strong
bourbon
oak
and
vanilla
fruit
and
spice
taste
is
vanilla
smooth
and
fruity
some
booze
pretty
mellow
overall
ok
osome
carbonation
would
do
this
beer
wonders
still
good
but
a
batch
without
carbonation
issues
would
be
amazing
overall
impression
wow
what
a
treat
enjoyed
the
hell
out
of
this
beer
and
looking
to
age
at
least
2
of
these
bottles
for
at
least
a
year
recommend
this
guy
try
if
you
can
o
this
is
one
of
the
most
bourbon
barrel
forward
beers
ive
ever
had
the
base
fred
is
completely
lost
and
was
taken
over
by
the
barrel
thankfully
i
enjoy
the
strong
barrel
presence
this
is
a
beer
to
pour
when
you
only
plan
on
having
1
and
have
time
to
enjoy
it

gfunk
very
good
d
a
bit
of
spritz
would
help
make
this
more
drinkable
if
you
like
drinking
bourbon
then
youll
dig
this
but
its
somewhat
heavyhanded
age
will
blunt
the
alcohol
a
bit
but
i
dont
anticipate
this
carbonating
any
time
soon
i
like
spirits
so
this
was
nice
in
small
doses
overall
disappointing
really
the
regular
fred
is
such
a
fantastic
beer
and
the
barrel
aging
here
didnt
really
help
it
out
besides
the
fact
that
this
bottle
was
completely
flat
the
bourbon
barrel
aging
is
too
dominant
basically
whiping
the
base
beer
off
the
planet
more
nuanced
barrel
aging
would
allow
the
beauty
that
is
fred
play
a
roll
in
the
flavor
profile
a
little
more
and
some
carbonation
would
help
the
whole
experience
further
glad
to
have
tried
this
and
ill
wait
and
hope
future
batches
turn
out
better
m
medium
body
with
some
chew
light
carbonation
prying
the
cap
off
gave
a
tiny
hiss
indicative
of
the
practically
nonexistent
carbonation
i
expected
poured
into
a
hotd
stemmed
taster
a
murky
burnt
orange
color
with
no
head
and
extremely
low
carbonation
with
the
tiniest
of
collars
around
the
rim
of
the
glass
which
left
microscopic
strands
of
lacing
an
interesting
aroma
raisins
caramel
chocolate
vanilla
dried
orange
peel
a
lot
going
on
in
the
taste
as
well
but
largely
reflected
the
aroma
chewy
caramel
and
brown
sugar
raisin
heavily
oaked
bourbon
still
apparent
even
after
years
of
mellowing
vanilla
and
dried
citrus
zest
with
a
candylike
sweetness
id
imagine
this
was
much
boozier
fresh
but
the
bourbon
and
overall
higher
abv
was
pretty
wellintegrated
at
this
point
body
was
closing
in
on
full
mouthfeel
was
slick
but
the
practically
lifeless
carb
sort
of
detracted
from
the
mouthfeel
i
always
know
hotd
brews
are
going
to
be
low
carb
but
i
still
always
wish
there
was
just
a
bit
more
in
there
to
liven
up
the
mouthfeel
still
a
good
brew
overall
but
with
a
complexity
in
the
flavor
that
might
come
off
as
messy
to
some
o
surprisingly
sweet
maltbomb
with
great
bourbon
taste
and
assuming
the
time
it
had
to
mellow
contributed
to
the
lack
of
alcohol
heat
o
solid
beer
with
lots
of
flavor
it
was
definitely
thick
and
flat
this
is
definitely
a
big
bready
and
malty
beer
that
is
loaded
with
bourbon
sweetness
worth
tracking
down
o
unexpectedly
undesireable
i
can
only
sense
what
could
have
been
d
even
though
it
needs
more
bubbles
this
is
a
decent
offering
the
flavor
is
balanced
enough
and
feels
smooth
enough
to
work
even
without
the
carbonation
would
definitely
revisit
which
is
good
because
ive
got
another
bottle
oa
treat
to
drink
would
love
to
try
this
again
very
different
than
most
barrel
agreed
beers
i
have
tried
before
but
then
again
hair
of
the
dog
is
just
very
different
well
that
caught
me
off
guard
i
guess
in
the
bourbon
fred
i
was
kind
of
picking
up
the
barrel
but
describing
it
as
a
sweetness
and
the
cherry
im
amazed
at
the
difference
in
carbonation
as
well
hell
of
a
pairing
and
im
thrilled
at
the
opportunity
to
try
a
bourbon
fred
didnt
plan
on
that
one
happening
thanks
quirkzoo
for
hitting
another
want
of
mine
pretty
damn
awesome
i
really
liked
this
overall
i
dont
mind
uncarbed
beers
at
all
particularly
when
they
are
done
this
well
better
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
m
full
bodied
but
the
carbonation
keeps
this
drinkable
until
the
end
a
stunning
sipper
d
very
drinkable
the
lack
of
carbonation
hurts
it
a
bit
but
the
barrel
flavor
blends
so
nicely
with
the
base
beer
that
it
is
still
very
enjoyable
overall
i
guess
it
helps
that
i
like
flat
beers
but
i
thought
that
this
was
an
absolutely
fantastic
american
strong
ale
and
i
will
most
certainly
be
trying
to
get
some
more
bottles
of
it
in
the
future
thanks
jeff
for
helping
me
to
recover
and
giving
me
the
chance
to
try
this
epic
bottle
poured
a
deep
brown
color
ale
with
almost
no
head
and
no
lacing
pretty
much
flat
aroma
of
kentucky
bourbon
with
some
vanilla
is
pretty
powerful
with
distinct
alcohol
ester
and
loads
of
brown
sugar
notes
taste
is
an
unbalanced
mix
between
strong
notes
of
bourbon
with
some
loads
of
brown
sugar
notes
and
some
light
vanilla
body
is
full
with
almost
no
carbonation
and
loads
of
alcohol
ester
is
discernable
too
boozy
and
too
sweet
for
my
taste
probably
the
type
of
beer
that
could
be
split
four
ways
for
a
12oz
bottle
overall
could
be
so
much
more
i
would
love
to
try
a
2012
bottle
of
this
warming
and
delicious
but
just
a
touch
too
sweet
and
too
flat
to
be
great
all
in
all
a
fine
beer
despite
the
obvious
lack
i
hope
another
year
or
two
will
allow
some
slowmo
carbonation
to
occur
but
it
seems
unlikely
still
a
beer
i
am
quite
happy
to
enjoy
o
i
think
im
going
to
save
the
rest
of
mine
for
winter
and
make
sure
to
open
them
when
i
have
guests
as
even
a
12oz
is
too
much
sweetness
for
me
for
one
sitting
unlike
many
hotd
beers
this
one
is
so
smooth
that
i
see
little
reason
to
age
it
in
fact
with
the
hops
being
the
only
thing
keeping
the
sweetness
in
check
i
dare
say
this
will
be
better
fresh
than
with
age
awesome
beer
dont
let
the
initial
mediocre
reviews
throw
you
the
2012
version
is
great
still
love
the
beer
though
and
eagerly
waiting
for
the
2014
i
had
a
taste
of
last
years
version
a
couple
times
and
thought
it
was
decent
despite
the
carb
issues
with
that
problem
solved
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
complex
with
the
barrel
integration
done
perfectly
kudos
alan
the
bottle
opens
with
barely
a
pfft
and
pours
a
murky
deep
brown
color
zero
head
and
just
a
smattering
of
bubbles
for
fucks
sake
brewers
if
you
are
going
to
release
a
premium
product
for
a
premium
price
qc
the
fucking
beer
before
you
release
it
smells
heavy
of
sweet
bourbon
and
oak
with
lots
of
sugary
caramel
and
toffee
malt
sweetness
the
flavor
is
sweet
sugary
malt
with
lots
of
caramel
brown
sugar
dark
sweet
fruits
oak
vanilla
and
bourbon
thick
body
with
a
sweet
sickly
syrupy
mouthfeel
and
a
non
existent
level
of
carbonation
smells
great
tastes
ok
the
mouthfeel
is
shot
from
the
lack
of
carbonation
i
didnt
give
flat
abbey
any
slack
and
im
not
giving
this
one
any
either
this
could
be
a
great
beer
i
guess
ill
never
know
edit
from
72912
had
this
beer
again
at
the
wildwood
hotd
dinner
event
and
the
version
there
was
much
better
i
suspect
the
wait
staff
opened
the
beer
some
time
in
advance
giving
the
beer
a
chance
to
open
up
also
the
version
at
wildwood
wasnt
nearly
as
cold
as
the
bottle
i
enjoyed
at
the
tasting
room
and
i
think
that
helped
as
well
just
something
to
keep
in
mind
o
really
good
flavor
but
disappointing
carbonation
hotd
bottle
variation
strikes
again
pours
a
cloudy
dark
golden
color
with
a
small
offwhite
head
intense
bourbon
and
booze
aromas
come
through
immediately
a
hint
of
caramel
and
butterscotch
with
vanilla
and
oak
being
strong
contributors
as
well
intensely
sweet
on
both
the
nose
and
palate
lots
of
sweet
caramel
vanilla
and
whiskey
notes
on
the
tongue
decently
woody
but
not
quite
as
much
as
regular
fred
from
the
wood
perhaps
a
hint
of
maple
syrup
on
the
finish
a
hint
of
carbonation
would
have
improved
this
already
good
beer
note
i
gave
the
original
2011
vintage
a
mediocre
score
as
a
had
this
is
an
incredible
improvement
over
its
brother
o
unlike
a
lot
of
reviewers
i
dont
think
the
lack
of
carbonation
totally
ruins
this
beer
obviously
would
be
better
with
it
but
its
certainly
still
enjoyable
especially
considering
the
stellar
barrel
character
o
overall
i
liked
this
one
quite
a
bit
while
the
bourbon
is
very
up
front
in
the
nose
it
isnt
as
much
in
the
taste
and
isnt
too
hot
which
is
good
id
put
this
on
par
with
the
normal
fred
we
had
though
it
was
split
who
liked
which
one
better
we
all
agreed
fftw
was
the
best
of
the
three
still
would
like
to
have
it
again
overall
yes
its
completely
flat
but
still
tastes
and
smells
delicious
super
sweet
like
a
dessert
wine
rich
and
moderately
complex
a
very
tasty
beer
this
bourbon
fred
good
balance
of
the
barrels
and
the
barleywine
its
a
little
sweet
but
thats
just
fine
with
me
a
little
more
carbonation
would
make
this
one
epic
probably
my
least
favorite
hair
of
the
dog
offering
yet
and
price
per
ounce
this
is
one
of
the
worst
beers
ive
ever
purchased
big
thanks
goes
out
to
dprouty
for
sending
me
this
one
along
with
a
hair
of
the
dog
tulip
in
a
recent
trade
served
from
bottle
into
a
hair
of
the
dog
tulip
proper
poured
a
murky
red
orange
with
an
extremely
minimal
almost
none
existent
offwhite
head
there
was
no
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
candi
sugar
vanilla
sweet
alcohol
and
caramel
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
dark
fruit
candi
sugar
vanilla
sweet
alcohol
wood
and
sweet
candy
it
had
a
medium
feel
on
the
palate
with
very
little
carbonation
made
it
feel
much
thicker
overall
this
was
a
fairly
good
brew
this
one
really
didnt
show
its
true
abv
due
to
all
the
sweetness
going
on
but
you
could
definitely
tell
this
one
was
a
heavyhitter
the
lack
of
carbonation
really
hurt
this
one
in
my
opinion
as
it
made
it
very
thick
feeling
and
not
a
huge
treat
for
the
palate
compared
to
the
other
components
going
on
here
glad
i
finally
got
to
try
this
one
but
doubt
i
will
seek
it
out
again
on
tap
at
the
brew
pub
2008
vintage
pous
a
dark
mahogany
color
with
virtually
no
head
aroma
is
uber
boozey
bourbon
dominates
with
maybe
some
malts
and
earth
but
its
hard
to
pick
up
on
anything
other
than
the
booze
i
do
note
some
vanilla
from
the
wood
though
taste
is
very
boozey
with
some
sweetness
and
vanilla
at
the
end
a
bit
earthy
bourbon
finish
this
is
one
hot
beer
but
its
not
overly
hot
medium
bodied
overall
this
is
really
boozey
but
it
is
called
bourbon
fred
so
its
not
much
of
a
shock
overall
glad
i
tried
it
and
although
i
wouldnt
have
it
all
the
time
its
pretty
solid
received
this
beer
as
an
extra
along
with
the
adam
from
the
wood
was
really
looking
forward
to
trying
this
one
out
poured
from
12oz
bottle
2011
vintage
into
snifter
glass
pours
murky
cooper
with
a
small
head
aroma
of
light
fruit
oak
bourbon
sugar
and
raisins
flavor
is
sweet
malt
boozy
tanic
oak
and
vanilla
with
a
light
hop
bitterness
medium
to
full
body
with
mild
carbonation
and
a
thick
sugary
mouthfeel
this
beer
was
not
pleasant
at
all
for
me
as
there
was
some
overpowering
unpleasant
taste
somewhere
in
the
middle
that
almost
made
this
beer
a
drain
pour
for
me
i
am
actually
surprised
that
the
regular
fred
easily
blows
this
bigger
brother
version
out
of
the
water
this
beer
pours
a
light
bodied
caramel
syrup
dirty
dark
amber
with
only
an
ever
so
slight
light
watery
head
the
nose
is
superb
its
full
of
smooth
bourbon
sweet
toffee
and
caramel
with
a
lot
of
oak
a
lot
of
wood
the
flavors
are
nice
as
well
there
is
a
lot
of
oak
and
spice
im
surprised
that
those
lead
off
there
is
smooth
bourbon
malty
spice
toffee
caramel
silky
fudge
a
lot
of
oak
and
what
i
perceive
as
a
touch
of
cherry
its
very
interesting
the
lack
of
carbonation
actually
doesnt
body
this
beer
much
at
all
the
beer
still
coats
your
mouth
with
silky
caramel
overall
this
beer
is
really
really
interesting
i
like
it
a
lot
it
has
a
unique
twang
to
it
making
it
almost
unrecognizable
of
compared
to
the
regular
overall
it
tasted
ok
not
trading
for
this
one
again
o
im
not
sure
if
i
can
truly
say
that
the
lack
of
carbonation
hurts
this
beer
i
dont
think
it
does
the
flavors
are
great
the
mouthfeel
is
somehow
appropriate
the
aroma
lacks
a
little
bit
although
potent
ill
happily
take
more
of
this
o
maybe
not
as
great
as
i
was
hoping
but
pretty
good
and
i
am
glad
i
got
to
try
it
the
flavors
play
quite
well
together
half
way
through
i
did
throw
in
a
splash
of
wellcarbonated
fred
for
bubbles
i
thought
it
was
better
it
really
brought
out
the
subtle
fruits
and
played
off
the
bourbon
very
well
o
a
very
enjoyable
beer
i
wish
there
was
some
more
carbonation
to
help
break
up
the
bodysweetness
of
the
beer
the
lack
of
carbonation
isnt
such
a
glaring
flaw
as
it
can
be
in
other
beers
but
it
still
detracts
from
the
beer
regardless
very
enjoyable
and
glad
to
try
it
overall
it
was
a
good
beer
but
wasnt
a
great
beer
in
my
opinion
the
no
carbonation
aspect
hurt
it
a
lot
and
made
it
feel
almost
like
a
bourbon
cocktail
and
not
a
beer
the
bourbon
flavors
were
very
good
but
that
seemed
like
all
it
had
going
for
it
in
the
way
the
barrel
character
is
expressed
it
reminds
me
of
older
batches
of
angels
share
despite
the
fact
that
theyre
very
different
beers
truly
fantastic
stuff
id
love
to
revisit
this
every
few
months
refined
and
harmonious
in
a
way
that
very
few
beers
are
these
days
very
very
highly
recommended
this
is
one
of
the
few
beers
in
recent
memory
that
had
me
swearing
in
delight
for
this
reason
and
no
other
this
beer
earns
the
55
i
gave
it
overall
this
was
a
let
down
i
think
this
beer
has
a
lot
of
potential
but
the
lack
of
carbonation
and
the
awful
smell
isnt
helping
the
flavor
is
complex
and
the
sweet
toffee
makes
for
a
nice
night
cap
overall
good
stuff
went
back
the
next
day
for
another
hit
o
nothing
left
to
say
sucked
difficult
for
me
to
judge
this
one
but
it
couldnt
hold
the
jock
strap
of
adam
from
the
wood
heavy
tastes
off
i
just
cant
imagine
this
one
getting
any
better
with
an
early
dose
of
oxidation
either
not
a
good
beer
one
of
my
biggest
letdowns
to
date
im
not
going
to
be
able
to
finish
the
bottle
this
is
truly
deserving
of
a
failing
grade
overall
not
nearly
as
complex
or
tasty
as
i
had
hoped
or
expected
o
carbonation
would
work
wonders
for
this
otherwise
this
is
a
soso
slow
sipper
poured
the
12oz
bottle
into
my
dfh
snifter
and
for
a
second
i
thought
i
had
a
glass
of
unfiltered
apple
cider
the
aroma
was
mellow
with
bourbon
upfront
and
hints
of
oak
and
raisin
the
taste
was
good
but
it
immediately
felt
off
with
the
lack
of
carbonation
after
taking
a
mental
adjustment
and
taking
it
for
what
it
is
i
enjoyed
the
beer
bourbon
and
oak
dominate
with
the
flavor
upfront
with
a
nice
mellow
lingering
flavor
of
dark
dried
fruits
overall
i
am
glad
that
i
got
to
try
it
but
be
warned
about
the
lack
of
carbonation
o
its
decent
but
not
amazing
and
i
cant
see
where
it
is
going
to
get
better
bottle
to
snifter
looks
decent
typical
of
a
strong
ale
only
a
bit
lighter
smells
good
woody
bourbony
and
malty
tastes
very
good
just
different
like
a
bb
quad
meets
a
bb
strong
mouthfeel
is
good
too
just
different
overall
a
good
brew
worth
trading
for
if
its
available
o
i
had
a
fred
the
night
before
to
remind
myself
of
it
but
this
felt
like
a
different
beer
i
enjoy
the
barrel
aging
of
hotd
and
appreciate
that
they
take
their
time
with
it
but
this
one
could
have
used
a
little
more
carbonation
but
thats
really
my
big
knock
on
this
one
the
bourbon
was
at
a
low
level
but
well
integrated
into
the
flavor
and
the
oak
was
nice
and
full
which
gets
lost
with
beers
not
aged
in
barrels
as
long
for
what
this
is
a
nice
beer
o
a
well
made
ale
that
im
certainly
glad
to
have
tried
however
its
a
bit
sweet
for
me
i
would
recommend
it
but
feel
like
the
sweetness
is
overpowering
and
the
balance
isnt
where
it
could
be
it
seems
close
to
a
barley
wine
to
me
its
amazing
that
the
alcohol
is
so
well
covered
this
could
be
a
dangerous
beer
because
of
that
interesting
but
i
dont
think
ill
be
trying
to
snag
any
next
time
around
overall
score3
48
as
i
said
earlier
another
great
example
of
expert
barrel
aging
while
still
being
balanced
complex
and
well
integrated
together
overall
another
hotd
failure
at
least
it
was
announced
ahead
of
time
equivalent
of
around
30
bucks
for
a
four
pack
of
this
bas
are
suckers
sometimes
arent
we
12oz
bottle
thanks
to
dsgolovin
appreciate
it
like
most
people
have
noted
this
is
completely
flat
and
the
beer
really
suffered
as
a
result
dark
murky
orange
color
aroma
of
bourbon
oranges
strange
yet
interesting
tasted
like
vanilla
and
oranges
booze
not
bad
but
the
lack
of
carbonation
made
it
seem
like
juice
with
booze
in
it
overall
disappointing
overall
this
is
good
but
not
great
pours
a
completely
flat
reddishbrown
smell
is
awesome
fantastic
mix
of
oak
and
bourbon
with
hints
of
booze
and
raisins
taste
is
a
very
nice
sweet
bourbon
flavor
with
raisins
factoring
in
as
well
mouthfeel
is
mediumbodied
but
completely
flat
overall
this
is
a
great
smelling
very
nice
tasting
beer
but
it
suffers
from
its
lack
of
carbonation
i
liked
it
but
id
take
regular
fred
over
it
any
day
taste
is
very
alcoholic
and
bourbon
boost
and
sharp
with
a
super
malty
and
bourbon
finish
but
its
so
flat
its
really
hard
to
enjoy
excellent
beer
in
spite
of
the
carb
issue
glad
ive
got
some
to
lay
down
and
age
picked
up
this
bottle
last
week
at
hi
times
pours
pond
water
flat
like
a
juice
very
disappointing
to
see
this
is
devoid
of
any
carbonation
the
label
should
have
provided
a
warning
smell
is
dominated
by
oxidation
behind
that
are
layers
of
bourbon
vanilla
and
brown
sugar
but
the
nose
is
really
dominated
by
the
smell
of
a
beer
that
has
not
aged
well
in
spite
of
this
being
a
new
release
taste
is
slightly
more
balanced
but
this
beer
still
tastes
like
a
horribly
aged
improperly
cellared
brew
again
notes
of
bourbon
brown
sugar
and
vanilla
are
present
as
well
body
is
fairly
thick
and
entirely
uncarbonated
overall
this
is
an
extremely
disappointing
beer
regular
fred
and
fftw
are
so
much
better
again
i
wish
this
beer
had
carbonation
i
feel
like
it
would
then
have
been
more
enjoyable
overall
i
thought
it
was
okay
and
it
grew
on
me
as
i
continued
to
drink
it
however
the
4oz
i
had
were
enough
beer
is
light
to
medium
in
body
and
really
sweet
very
bourbony
very
strong
alcohol
cuts
through
immediately
leaving
a
dryness
on
the
palate
strong
throughout
a
decent
beer
but
as
stated
before
this
is
like
fred
if
you
put
a
shot
of
bourbon
in
it
not
as
complex
as
advertised
pours
a
moderatelydark
caramel
color
with
a
short
off
whiter
head
and
a
thin
collar
the
nose
has
bourbon
and
some
slight
oak
tannin
heavy
malt
and
light
caramel
flavor
is
a
bit
more
integrated
with
a
touch
less
tannin
medium
body
with
low
carbonation
pretty
good
but
the
bourbon
takes
over
the
base
beer
and
is
a
bit
too
onedimensional
the
beer
is
a
murky
copperbrownorange
hue
with
virtually
no
head
the
aroma
brings
bourbon
oak
subtle
fruit
and
spice
good
flavor
slightly
tannic
smooth
bourbon
taste
with
low
carbonation
a
tasty
brew
a
bit
less
sweet
than
regular
fred
which
is
nice
like
the
other
beers
in
this
lineup
this
is
suitable
for
slow
sipping
and
savoring
overall
very
good
something
i
would
definitely
enjoy
having
again
pours
darker
than
regular
fred
a
dark
crimson
golden
with
a
thin
white
head
no
carbonation
and
settles
in
a
still
murky
liquid
booze
and
bourbon
dominate
the
aroma
with
vanilla
honey
clove
brown
sugar
nearly
still
body
silky
smooth
and
thick
with
a
sticky
dry
finish
flavor
is
syrupy
and
sweet
following
the
nose
but
more
bourbon
oak
tobacco
and
vanilla
enjoyed
regular
fred
much
more
this
beer
has
a
lot
of
potential
its
complex
with
a
well
integrated
flavor
profile
thats
just
downright
tasty
however
the
lack
of
carbonation
really
hurts
this
one
still
worth
seeking
out
though
o
outstanding
nose
and
taste
but
totally
flat
its
a
nice
sipper
and
i
would
be
headoverheels
in
love
if
it
had
some
bubbles
but
hey
its
still
not
bad
totally
still
would
recommend
but
if
you
are
expecting
bubbles
youll
be
disappointed
booyakasha
in
the
end
its
never
about
the
carbonation
its
about
the
taste
and
this
beer
taste
good
looking
forward
to
coming
back
and
as
i
listen
to
this
beer
develop
and
more
importantly
hoping
i
have
the
resolve
to
hide
this
for
several
years
to
see
how
the
flavors
progress
over
time
a
cognac
of
beers
chocolate
and
vanilla
like
that
sam
adams
beer
a
sipper
rich
ingrediants
and
worthwhile
seeking
out
complex
bourbon
aroma
good
looks
as
well
buffalo
tasting
superior
barleywine
only
the
best
from
hotd
booze
is
well
hidden
i
did
not
realize
it
was
a
10
plus
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
i
love
regular
fred
so
to
have
this
one
aged
in
bourbon
barrels
is
a
real
treat
im
not
the
type
to
rate
on
lookscarbonationetc
which
i
guess
this
one
sort
of
lacked
but
the
smell
and
taste
were
just
what
i
expected
really
happy
to
have
one
of
these
in
the
cellar
for
another
time
perhaps
the
biggest
let
down
in
this
brew
is
its
drop
dead
lack
of
carbonation
it
is
full
bodied
and
smooth
in
the
feel
it
is
thick
enough
but
carries
enough
alcohol
inclusion
that
it
is
slick
and
does
not
coat
the
inside
of
the
mouth
while
being
still
does
not
fully
distract
from
the
experience
just
the
slightest
amount
of
carbonation
would
have
taken
this
brew
into
a
holy
realm
really
it
is
certainly
worth
the
effort
if
you
get
a
chance
solid
deep
brew
here
o
this
beer
is
a
colossal
dissapointment
buorbon
fred
had
the
potential
to
be
a
world
class
brew
the
aroma
and
flavor
are
there
in
a
big
way
but
the
lack
of
carbonation
creates
a
huge
detraction
from
the
experience
of
drinking
this
beer
damn
i
wish
this
beer
was
carbonated
would
not
have
this
vintage
again
but
will
revisit
future
years
and
hope
hotd
get
the
carbonation
problem
fixed
i
love
both
adam
and
fred
so
im
happy
to
drink
barrel
aged
versions
as
often
as
possible
i
will
continue
to
savor
this
for
the
next
half
hour
or
so
very
happy
i
got
the
opportunity
to
try
this
and
i
am
excited
to
throw
my
other
bottle
in
the
cellar
for
a
while
i
think
this
is
a
great
beer
but
it
could
be
better
if
the
mouthfeel
issues
were
addressed
somehow
beer
needs
bubbles
seriously
get
it
together
hotd
im
sick
of
flat
beer
especially
when
there
is
some
promise
im
not
going
to
end
up
finishing
this
one
nice
stuff
slightly
more
enjoyable
than
fred
from
the
wood
to
me
overall
this
is
certainly
a
unique
beer
it
is
exceptionally
tasty
and
smells
fantastic
but
i
am
having
a
very
hard
time
getting
over
the
mouthfeel
i
suppose
that
if
this
beer
is
approached
more
like
a
beerflavored
wine
it
might
work
a
little
better
i
have
absolutely
loved
all
the
other
hotd
beers
i
have
tried
and
tastewise
this
is
no
exception
call
me
smallminded
but
i
cant
get
over
the
lack
of
bubbles
that
said
ill
look
forward
to
popping
open
the
two
in
my
cellar
over
the
next
couple
years
overall
a
very
nice
decadent
sipper
carbonation
would
be
nice
but
its
absence
is
not
detrimental
to
the
beer
overall
i
would
drink
this
on
a
regular
basis
if
i
could
a
well
done
if
not
slightly
frustrating
effort
from
a
brewery
that
perpetually
lands
amongst
my
favorites
despite
its
flaws
i
will
revisit
this
to
see
if
father
time
has
done
his
business
overall
im
glad
i
got
to
try
it
if
this
was
carbonated
properly
itd
be
an
absolutely
amazing
beer
mouthfeel
is
flat
but
not
incredibly
sticky
this
beer
reminds
me
of
a
mead
more
than
fermented
grain
o
this
is
an
amazing
beer
can
only
imagine
what
it
would
be
like
with
some
carbonation
wow
makes
me
really
anticipate
adam
from
the
wood
that
much
more
3
54
54
544
o
good
but
sordove
disappointing
due
to
the
carbonaton
or
lack
thereof
overall
this
beer
lives
up
to
the
hype
very
complex
and
delicious
with
a
well
balanced
oakbourbon
element
the
only
thing
i
would
change
is
slightly
higher
carbonation
overall
i
cant
wait
for
the
bottled
version
had
on
tap
with
alan
at
his
old
brewery
two
years
ago
it
was
heavenly
then
cant
imagine
how
good
itll
be
soon
in
bottle
buying
a
case
for
sure
alan
makes
world
class
beers
always
o
fred
aged
in
elaigh
craig
bourbon
barrels
for
15
months
yum
i
would
love
to
see
this
in
a
bottle
but
since
this
is
not
likely
i
will
be
back
soon
to
have
more
of
this
one
d
the
abv
though
not
ridiculously
high
is
still
prominent
early
on
not
boozy
per
se
but
i
definitely
felt
it
nevertheless
its
deceptively
drinkable
fantastic
one
of
the
best
bourbonbarrelaged
beers
ive
tried
d
well
i
drank
round
one
in
about
5
minutes
that
says
something
imagine
dropping
a
shot
of
bourbon
into
12
ounces
of
fred
pure
deliciousness
note
the
brewery
lists
this
beer
at
12
abv
despite
the
current
listing
here
on
ba
of
10
honestly
i
preferred
regular
fftw
to
the
bourbon
version
this
comes
in
a
little
more
one
dimensional
and
not
as
complex
than
again
thats
all
the
more
reason
to
bottle
this
beer
and
give
it
time
to
develop
more
character
that
being
said
even
at
the
7
50
price
per
12
ounce
pour
in
the
tasting
room
i
would
say
that
this
is
worth
every
penny
nobody
makes
beer
exactly
like
alan
sprints
his
beers
are
truly
world
class
and
deserve
the
respect
they
receive
unique
original
and
delicious
i
will
be
buying
bottles
of
this
for
further
development
if
given
the
opportunity
drink
ability
alcohol
bomb
it
tastes
like
sweet
bourbon
but
i
kind
of
dig
it
its
abv
of
11
5
but
ts
pretty
drinkable
d
perfect
if
you
can
get
your
hands
on
this
one
in
9
months
please
do
so
the
leather
and
dark
roast
flavors
in
the
typical
fred
have
been
replaced
by
sweet
bourbony
goodness
2013
mix
of
peach
and
cherry
very
tasty
and
sweet
aging
could
only
make
it
better
not
sure
what
was
going
on
with
this
one
did
not
come
together
well
o
amazing
flavor
great
barrel
character
with
sweet
fruits
fantastic
a
real
treat
this
was
a
supertreat
got
a
big
bottle
from
a
good
and
well
known
beerfriend
bill
young
shared
this
bottle
at
the
2014
borefts
beerfestival
in
holland
increadibly
balanced
beer
with
real
chunks
of
fruit
in
it
overall
drinks
outrageously
well
for
a
13
beer
reminds
me
of
the
j
w
lees
harvest
series
but
even
better
i
expected
sourness
and
pain
from
the
cherries
and
peach
but
not
at
all
great
balance
all
around
a
wonder
of
sweet
and
sour
so
different
and
well
accomplished
would
buy
and
drink
again
despite
the
high
price
oimproves
as
it
warms
currently
the
cherries
are
in
the
forefront
age
might
tone
them
down
but
it
is
still
a
yummy
beer
pretty
good
but
the
coriander
is
fighting
with
the
fruit
overall
interesting
and
the
cherry
is
executed
well
similar
to
cherry
rye
not
too
tart
not
sour
integrates
well
with
the
sweetness
of
the
base
beer
o
overall
an
extremely
interesting
beer
more
on
the
matt
spectrum
than
the
fred
spectrum
as
this
one
really
comes
across
as
a
strong
ale
and
has
little
remnants
of
anything
fred
about
it
other
than
coming
from
hotd
dont
love
the
chunks
floating
around
actually
a
big
turnoff
to
me
but
the
flavor
is
great
would
have
a
higher
rating
if
it
wasnt
for
all
dat
stuff
the
palate
opens
big
and
boozy
as
is
expected
but
with
a
blend
of
honey
sweetness
peachy
lightness
and
cherry
sweetness
the
cherries
are
the
more
dominant
of
the
fruits
but
the
peaches
are
an
inspired
addition
the
mid
palate
has
flavors
of
rye
a
moderate
sweetness
with
a
blend
of
raisin
bread
honey
and
some
caramel
the
finish
is
long
and
boozy
with
the
barrel
dominating
vanilla
bourbon
spicy
heat
and
a
little
bit
of
tannin
character
medium
full
in
body
and
moderately
carbonated
a
little
too
much
if
you
ask
me
this
beer
is
a
treat
on
the
palate
the
alcohol
does
lighten
the
finish
considerably
relieving
the
beer
of
its
heft
excellent
stuff
albeit
pricey
overall
a
beer
that
is
so
interesting
its
obviously
not
gonna
be
loved
by
all
see
what
you
think
this
is
a
full
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
overall
very
boozy
and
medicinal
with
a
profound
spicy
barrel
impact
you
dont
really
pick
up
much
on
the
individual
parts
that
compose
this
blend
until
it
warms
up
and
you
really
think
about
it
the
cherry
is
more
medicinal
and
the
apricotpeachy
quality
comes
out
faintly
in
the
aftertaste
m
medium
to
full
body
light
carbonation
wanted
to
give
this
one
a
proper
review
davehack
was
nice
enough
to
share
a
bottle
with
me
and
thankfully
for
the
both
of
us
we
didnt
waste
more
than
one
bottle
of
this
the
beer
poured
out
as
a
dark
brown
color
with
some
red
highlights
it
had
a
fizzy
white
head
on
top
that
faded
quickly
there
was
no
retention
or
lacing
on
this
beer
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
nice
some
big
malt
and
subtle
fruity
notes
with
a
bit
of
sourness
too
the
taste
was
decent
similar
to
a
fruity
barley
wine
subtle
tart
notes
with
some
malt
complexity
the
mouthfeel
was
terrible
to
me
easily
the
worst
mouthfeel
on
a
beer
ive
ever
had
there
was
a
big
amount
of
pulplike
fruit
strands
in
there
even
after
a
gentle
pour
which
made
me
feel
like
i
was
drinking
carbonated
oj
with
extra
pulp
overall
this
beer
would
benefit
greatly
from
some
kind
of
filtration
this
ended
up
getting
poured
down
the
drain
because
we
were
so
grossed
out
by
it
this
ones
not
for
me
i
guess
darker
rubyamber
pour
with
a
small
offwhite
head
that
receded
to
a
bubbly
ringlet
minimal
lacing
and
lots
of
chunky
floaties
in
suspension
nice
aroma
fruitcake
and
candied
cherries
or
maybe
cherry
candy
caramel
malts
slight
earthy
notes
fairly
hot
with
booze
in
the
nose
though
not
so
much
on
the
palate
taste
similarly
of
chewy
candied
cherries
and
fruitcake
the
peach
didnt
really
come
screaming
at
me
but
it
was
somewhere
in
the
mix
there
caramel
with
an
underlying
and
almost
spicycinnamony
earthiness
wet
oak
this
beer
wasnt
really
sour
or
tart
but
there
was
some
tangy
fruit
sweetness
i
dont
really
feel
that
the
beer
was
overly
phenolic
or
medicinal
but
the
higher
abv
definitely
made
it
a
bit
stiff
though
still
highly
drinkable
body
was
on
the
heavier
side
of
medium
with
a
somewhat
chewy
mouthfeel
i
enjoyed
this
one
a
lot
and
id
like
to
let
my
other
bottle
sit
for
a
while
to
see
what
it
becomes
in
a
few
months
or
so
overall
hotd
managed
to
impressed
me
with
this
beer
its
just
got
that
unique
quality
that
most
hotd
beers
always
bring
to
the
table
and
with
that
said
i
dont
think
that
i
have
ever
tried
an
american
strong
ale
that
was
aged
on
both
cherries
and
peaches
its
a
good
beer
for
sure
pours
a
murky
reddishbrown
with
a
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
tobacco
fruit
and
wood
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
caramel
fruit
and
alcohol
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
woody
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
with
an
interesting
barrel
presence
but
the
aromas
and
flavors
are
a
bit
muddled
all
around
in
my
opinion
taste
is
solid
on
this
one
but
it
needs
at
least
a
year
or
two
to
settle
down
the
heat
the
sediment
is
really
a
shame
though
and
having
to
sift
through
an
ounce
of
gunk
to
get
at
the
beer
really
detracted
from
this
one
for
me
such
is
the
crapshoot
with
hotd
bottles
o
a
decadent
treat
for
those
who
like
port
dessert
wines
its
far
greater
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
cherry
and
peach
fred
and
for
that
it
should
be
commended
still
i
would
rate
this
about
the
middle
of
the
hair
of
the
dog
pantheon
a
blend
of
barrel
aged
cherry
and
peach
freds
on
tap
hotd
pours
deep
ruby
with
no
head
nose
is
sweet
bourbon
and
caramel
cherry
with
hints
of
oak
and
heat
taste
is
fantasticreally
smooth
blend
of
black
cherry
bourbon
vanilla
mellow
oak
and
big
waves
of
bready
malt
dont
get
the
peaches
but
im
sure
theyre
in
there
somewhere
real
smooth
and
velvety
in
the
mouth
even
though
its
not
all
that
carbonated
overall
really
tasty
not
without
the
hurdles
of
a
huge
beer
good
fruit
and
the
base
beer
stands
up
to
all
the
craziness
theyve
done
to
it
o
i
lucked
out
on
this
one
i
think
it
is
better
than
its
components
which
is
saying
a
lot
drinks
very
easy
and
smooth
as
for
the
name
alan
indicated
that
otto
was
the
original
name
of
fred
eckhardt
apparently
when
he
originally
came
to
this
country
people
of
german
descent
were
looked
upon
with
suspicion
and
outright
hostility
i
gather
this
was
soon
after
wwii
so
he
apparently
elected
to
go
by
the
name
of
fred
instead
alan
indicated
that
he
has
always
held
fred
eckhardt
in
high
regard
and
so
it
made
sense
to
make
a
beer
with
his
original
name
in
honor
of
the
man
up
front
sweet
qualities
maple
syrup
wrapped
up
by
brown
sugar
and
caramel
just
a
pure
maple
candy
treat
the
abv
is
well
hidden
under
that
sweetness
overall
just
an
outstanding
ale
unlike
anything
else
brewed
by
the
very
best
out
of
this
world
best
vt
beer
ive
had
to
date
that
is
saying
something
this
beer
is
well
worth
the
price
of
admission
thank
god
above
i
showed
up
at
the
warren
store
on
the
right
day
and
its
strong
beware
overall
this
was
a
very
interesting
beer
that
im
excited
i
got
to
try
im
not
always
a
fan
of
dark
tripels
so
i
was
not
wowed
will
try
this
again
when
i
can
get
it
fresh
to
compare
to
this
almost
year
old
bottle
got
this
from
a
great
friend
who
lives
in

beautiful
slightly
hazy
dark
mahogany
pour
with
a
two

the
nose
is
incredible
with
huge
maple
notes
along
with
hints
of
brown
sugar
caramel
brown
bread
molasses
vanilla
and
toffee
the
taste
is
incredibly
rich
with
the
maple
once
again
the
star
hints
of
raisins
were
a
surprise
complemented
nicely
with
sweet
brown
bread
oak
toffee
caramel
brown
sugar
vanilla
booze
and
just
a
touch
of
chocolate
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
syrupy
with
subtle
creaminess
and
a
warming
somewhat
cloying
finish
overall
while
this
is
borderline
too
sweet
its
so
full
of
flavor
and
its
got
just
enough
balance
to
compensate
for
any
faults
highly
recommended

with
a

sticky
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
an
above
average
beer
with
a
nice
smell
but
the
flavors
are
slightly
oxidized
at
this
point
the
beer
pours
a
dark
hazy
amber
no
chunks
of
yeast
with
a
thin
halo
of

around
the
perimeter
the
nose
is

unexpected
notes
of
lactoselike
dairy
sweetness
distinct
maple
and

minimal

no

the
taste
is
maple
forward
as
hoped
with
a
hint
of
fruit

yeast
and
a
slight

in
the
finish
more
woody

generous

sweetness

not

has

in
the
finish
this
beer
is
fantastic
to
drink
especially
if
youre
a
maple
fan
but
ill
have
trouble
justifying
the
price
again
in
the
future
othe
most
unique

ive
tasted

loved
it

love
everything

another
homerun
by
sean
ive
actually
had
this
before
but
im
just
getting
around
to
reviewing
it
now
as
i
brought
out
a
bottle
to
share
at
ss14
this
is
truly
one
of
the
most
unique
beers
in
existence
pours
a
deep
bronzed
amber
color
not
really
hazy
but
glossy
if
that
makes
sense
like
looking
through
a
thick
piece
of
colored
glass
a
small
yellowtan
head
sinks
to
a
ringlet
and
a
swirl
leaves
some
legs
on
the
glass
rich
giving
a
sensation
of
a
maple
liqueur
more
than
any
other
kind

thankfully
as
with

o

smooth
and
indulgent
bordering

still
a
hell
of
a
beer
o

malty
with
plenty
of
bourbon
flavor

it
is
drinking
a

a

aged

can

i
totally
lost
on
this
one
overall
this
is
a
nice
offering
i
dont
think
it
quite
lives
up
to
the
hype
especially
for
the
price
tag
but
this
is
definitely
worth
a
try
for
barrel
aged
beer
lovers
overall
i
am
not
certain
is
i
aged
this
one
too
long
but
it
is
not
as
flavorful
as
i
would
hope
still
it
is
very
nice
for
21

well
it
was
good
but
not
worthy
of
the
price
had
on
draft
in
a
10
oz
snifter
glass
one
of
best
strong
barrel
aged
beers
i
have
ever
tried
a
must
if
you
ever
see
it
2012
version
drinking
really
well
with
a
couple
years
on
it
o
i
have
wanted
to
try
this
for
a
while
it
has
a
very
nice
smell
and
flavor
it
is
a
little
pricey
given
all
the
other
high
end
ba
ales
out
there
its
worth
trying
once
but
i
would
stock
up
on
fremont
or
firestone
walker
for
cellaring
taste
lots
of
licorice
dark
chocolate
fizzy
coke
like
mouth
feel
with
a
nice
sweetish
finish
some
heat
for
sure
but
not
too
boozy
very
very
nice
ba
still
like
wulver
better
but
could
drink
this
any
time
for
a
balanced
barrelaged
sipping
beer
it
seriously
doesnt
get
better
than
this
the
perfect
beer
for
cold
winter
nights
one
of
my
favs
from
lost
abbey
o
definitely
a
sipping
beer
wish
i
had
a
roaring
fire
going
in
the
fire
place
and
a
good
book
in
hand
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
will
buy
it
again
next
time
i
see
it
another
excellent
beer
from
lost
abbey
angels
share
is
a
very
sweet
beer
with
lots
of
bourbon
aroma
and
flavor
very
smooth
yes
you
do
notice
the
abv
fine
beer
so
well
balanced
so
tasty
i
had
to
double
check
the
style
after
drinking
it
because
it
just
was
not
what
i
expected
and
it
surprised
me
with
its
flavor
not
too
much
of
anything
just
smooth
and
tasty
and
strong
overall
great
sipping
beer
strong
boozy
and
delicious
o
this
is
a
great
tasting
beer
but
i
want
to
pause
here
and
wonder
this
beer
i
can
taste
no
base
beer
i
love
the
bourbon
but
what
is
the
point
except
to
round
out
the
rough
edges
of
bourbon
with
a
sweeter
taste
anyway
let
me
think
on
this
i
mag
edit
this
pours
dense
deep
brown
not
much
head
lacy
with
some
legs
the
nose
is
sherry
leather
prune
tobacco
vanilla
hint
of
bourbon
big
bold
palate
with
dark
dried
fruit
figs
prunes
sherry
vanilla
bourbon
oak
chocolate
and
some
malt
very
rich
and
bourbon
overall
simply
fantastic
the
aroma
had
me
concerned
that
it
was
going
to
be
harsh
but
its
one
of
the
smoothest
bourbon
barrelaged
brews
ive
had
to
date
its
a
steep
price
to
pay
for
less
than
a
pints
worth
but
if
youve
got
a
reason
to
treat
yourself
you
could
do
a
lot
worse
earlier
in
this
evening
i
split
a
22
oz
2013
scucaba
with
wifey
and
while
it
definitely
was
better
than
this
2014
angel
the
2013
angel
was
beter
than
the
2013
scucaba
again
imho
why
not
just
drink
bourbon
pours
very
dark
with
a
small
tan
head
buttery
boozy
wood
aromas
up
front
lead
to
a
smooth

sweet

very

a
cloudy
dark
brown
with
an
almost
non
existent
tan

beer
is
phenomenal
just
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
must
love
bourbon
since
this
one
was
aged
for
almost
two
years
in
barrels
overall
its
a
nice
barrel
aged
strong
ale
but
its
just
a
little
too
hot
unfortunately
easily
worth
trying
with
much
to
enjoy
still
though

o
a
world
class
offering
solid
a
rating
a
bit
pricey
at

spent
on
a
12
oz
but
worth
the
unique
experience
sticky
syrupy
oaky
goodness
in
a
bottle
with
a
lingering
aftereffect
of
alcohol
deep
in
the
belly
long
after
the
swallow
definitely
one
of
the
better
ba
stouts
but
its
no
bcbs
by
comparison
the
flavors
in
this
beer
are
fine
but
the
lack
of
carbonation
is
a
critical
flaw
that
causes
the
whole
affair
to
come
down
like
a
house
of
cards
i
wont
be
buying
this
one
again
o
overall
this
exceeded
my
expectations
and
i
wish
i
hadnt
traded
away
both
of
my
other
bottles
an
excellent
representation
of
the
style

the
cork

a

all
i
get
in
the
aroma
is
sweet
bourbon
and
a
bit
of
dark

the
mouth
is
silky
smooth
and
viscous
the
flavor
is
initially
dark

roasted

quickly
turns
very
sweet

mainly
in

were

and
balanced
overall
one
of
the
best
barleywines
ive
ever
had
highly
recommended
flat

is
officially
dead
this
cork
shot
out
of
the

with
a
huge
burst
of
sound
what
a
great
experience
dark
almost
black

with

you

bourbon
barrel
aging
effects
served
at
5055
degrees
this
beer
has
sweet
bourbon
notes
hidden
fruit
plumalcoholraisin
notes
but
a
dominant
kentucky
bourbon
barrel
aged
beer
is
perfect
for
fat
tuesday
the
alcohol
isnt
nearly
as
hot
as
the
nose
would
entail
theres
also
hints
of
molasses
and
other
burnt
sugars
along
the
way
the
woody
character
on
the
palate
carries
each
sip
to
the
bourbon
drinker
this
beer
would
be
a
god
send
and
i
do
believe
it
deserves
the
hype
im
just
not
a
huge
bourbon
drinker
so
this
wouldnt
be
my
desert
island
beer
however
i
appreciate
the
flavors
so
much
that
im
impressed
by
the
amount
of
bourbon
im
able
to
pick
up
mouthfeel
is
oily
intense
and
lingering
between
sips
but
complex
enough
and
not
just
straight
bourbon
barrel
aging
i
had
deliverance
on
tap
and
believe
me
i
love
it
but
they
are
apples
and
oranges
both
excellent
in
their
own
right
im
amazed
at
the
mellow
carbonation
on
the
palate
and
the
smoothness
between
sips
this
definitely
deserves
the
title
angels
share
o
i
dont
want
to
repeat
myself
but
it
was
very
enjoyable
fantastic
outstanding
etc
etc
etc
i
will
definitely
pick
up
as
many
of
these
i
can
find
if
i
can
ever
find
it
again
very
hard
to
find
this
beer
is
excellent
in
hiding
the
12
5
abv
and
presenting
the
oak
barrel
flavors
that
li
her
nicely
on
the
palette
this
beer
is
easily
worth
large
price
tag
o
pretty
dynamic
atrong
alebarleywine
doesnt
hid
the
booze
but
doesnt
wallop
either
really
good
and
worth
seeking
out
overall
this
beer
is
pretty
fantastic
rich
in
taste
almost
like
a
wave
of
caramelchocolate
soaked
in
booze
goes
down
a
bit
too
easy
for
something
so
high
in
alcohol
completely
still
beer
no
carbonation
i
found
it
interesting
how
many
bas
said
this
beer
when
fresh
was
too
hot
and
boozy
let
it
be
known
this
beast
has
been
tamed
it
is
now
a
warm
cuddly
lap
dog
in
your
glass
it
licks
your
face
fetches
your
slippers
and
cowers
when
you
raise
your
voice
i
rank
this
ahead
of
insanity
but
noticeably
behind
bourbon
county
brand
barleywine
the
beer
pours
very
little
head
to
the
point
that
is
virtually
nonexistant
the
beer
itself
is
a
deep
and
dark
brown
with
occasional
black
areas
the
beer
is
very
obscure
and
dark
that
it
gives
off
a
slick
shine
in
the
light
the
beer
has
a
very
strong
smell
and
noticeable
from
the
other
side
of
the
room
the
beer
has
strong
notes
of
vanilla
and
oak
that
are
supported
by
fairly
sweet
malts
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
smell
but
with
stronger
notes
of
vanilla
the
beer
also
a
bit
of
alcohol
to
the
taste
and
the
sweet
malts
are
particularly
noticeable
with
bits
of
hop
in
the
aftertaste
the
beer
feel
is
divine
despite
having
been
aged
for
so
long
the
beer
feels
extremely
smooth
and
slick
with
no
carbonation
overall
a
great
and
outstanding
beer
worthy
of
the
ages
while
this
is
not
nearly
as
flat
as
other
bottles
of
la
i
have
had
and
really
not
bad
this
just
leaves
me
wanting
more
fairly
standard
too
expensive
and
plenty
of
other
better
examples
of
the
style
for
me
locally
brewed
at
that
overall
not
the
most
aesthetically
pleasing
pour
but
all
other
factors
trump
its
underwhelming
appearance
after
letting
this
beer
warm
up
a
few
minutes
im
tempted
to
say
this
is
the
most
delicious
beer
ive
tasted
in
quite
some
time
overall
again
wow
a
rich
complex
beer
thats
definitely
worth
a
try
o
give
it
to
lost
abbey
to
make
another
wonder
bourbon
barrel
aged
beer
definitely
a
quality
beer
overall
smooth
and
sweet
ride
for
a
125
abv
bourbon
and
malt
bomb
aging
did
some
splendid
work
on
it
was
a
feast
but
holy
shit
half
gone
and
i
was
drunk
not
your
typical
sunday
stroll
o
age
has
done
this
one
wonders
smooth
and
sweet
beautiful
flavors
overall
this
is
an
amazing
beer
its
one
of
my
favorites
if
not
my
favorite
i
picked
up
a
couple
of
extras
so
i
look
forward
to
trying
this
again
in
a
year
or
so
unique
beer
that
has
a
unique
taste
was
not
my
personal
favorite
i
get
a
weird
prune
taste
during
and
after
i
take
a
sip
i
experienced
this
same
sensation
with
thelonious
monk
maybe
i
just
have
not
developed
my
palate
enough
for
this
type
of
beer
first
beer
i
have
tried
from
the
lost
abbey
will
hopefully
have
more
luck
with
another
beer
from
this
brewer
not
as
thick
but
reminds
me
a
lot
of
weyerbachers
insanity
very
similar
in
look
and
taste
it
would
be
interesting
to
do
a
blindfold
taste
with
the
two
nonetheless
this
british
barley
wine
is
delicious
albeit
a
bit
pricey
off
to
buy
another
one
hiccup
o
this
is
a
fantastic
ale
and
although
its
quite
a
bit
pricey
its
worth
at
least
a
try
or
two
would
love
to
buy
more
to
put
away
for
a
couple
years
the
liquid
is
much
thicker
than
eclipse
and
the
taste
is
also
much
thicker
sorry
about
the
frequent
references
to
the
eclipse
that
is
my
new
standard
this
clocks
in
at
12
5
though
and
that
explains
a
lot
of
the
thickerness
taste
is
also
of
the
dark
fruits
with
lots
of
bourbon
barrel
influence
one
of
the
best
tasting
12
brews
ive
ever
had
i
wonder
if
it
were
a
tad
lower
in
abv
if
it
be
a
little
smoother
and
at
that
point
perfect
the
sweet
caramelness
is
almost
a
little
beyond
base
either
way
this
is
still
a
great
brew
total
4550
a
wellwrought
strong
ale
with
heady
bourbon
barrel
notes
and
a
more
or
less
tempered
sweetness
overall
somehow
im
sure
theres
more
to
say
about
the
nature
of
this
affair
including
the
idea
espoused
in
the
name
and
on
the
label
but
im
too
tired
and
this
beer
is
too
good
for
me
to
get
any
more
florid
than
i
already
am
because
of
angels
share
on
tap
i
picked
up
2
bottles
2011
2013
and
a
bottle
of
2011
deliverance
which
i
am
excited
to
try
overall
a
very
nice
beer
and
certainly
the
carbonation
does
wonders
to
the
experience
the
flavors
are
very
well
integrated
and
drinks
rather
smooth
for
the
abv
i
still
prefer
deliverance
to
this
considering
it
has
a
bit
fuller
mouthfeel
and
more
depth
of
flavor
my
belief
is
this
has
become
a
bit
under
appreciated
though
not
a
shocker
considering
the
price
tag
but
still
not
a
beer
thats
talked
about
much
like
it
used
to
be
altogether
this
is
a
very
intense
yet
balanced
beer
a
true
sipper
and
well
worth
the
long
wait
for
the
barrelled
beer
erick
thank
you
so
much
for
making
this
beer
a
reality
this
is
so
good
i
hope
you
living
in
san
diego
get
the
chance
to
try
this
and
many
more
rare
bottles
from
the
lost
abbey
i
am
jealous
that
you
are
so
close
to
a
brewery
that
can
produce
beers
this
delicious
i
dont
want
it
to
end
overall
another
winner
from
lost
abbey
a
little
pricey
but
worth
it
the
angels
share
is
an
expensive
proposition
but
this
bourbon
barrel
version
wowed
me
good
balance
not
at
all
hot
this
is
ready
to
drink
right
now
a
topnotch
barrelaged
ale

the
notes
that
the
bourbon
placed
in
here
tasted
better
as
i
sipped
and
it
warmed
up
i
enjoyed
it
worth
the
try
although
its
pricey
t
lots
of
dark
and
booze
soaked
fruit
flavors
a
good
bit
of
sweetness
from
the
bourbon
and
some
notes
of
wood
a
bit
boozy
on
the
finish
but
pretty
tasty
stuff
is
there
a
better
beer
in
the
world
than
this
bring
it
to
me
this
pours
into
an
8oz
chalice
a
lovely
redbrown
color
with
a
minimal
and
fading
off
white
head
smells
like
a
billion
delicious
things
belgian
yeast
caramel
milk
chocolate
oak
chips
sweet
malt
booze
flavor
at
first
is
that
of
a
liquid
rollo
candy
chocolate
and
gooey
caramel
combined
but
soon
after
a
barleywine
sweetness
and
strength
assert
themselves
and
a
wood
aged
sort
of
depth
is
in
your
face
this
is
so
complex
and
evolving
its
insane
notes
of
dried
fruit
toll
house
semisweet
chips
and
jim
beam
come
through
there
is
no
other
beer
like
this
mouthfeel
is
near
perfect
too
plenty
of
bubbles
and
a
fuller
medium
body
strong
alcohol
burn
as
it
warms
magnificent
beer
with
everything
you
could
want
and
more
12
5
is
well
hidden
until
it
gets
warm
i
cant
say
enough
good
things
about
this
one
damn
damn
damn
only
thing
i
dont
like
is
the
price
12
for
an
8oz
pour
o
rich
and
decadent
is
how
i
would
describe
this
but
its
just
missing
an
extra
dimension
that
would
send
this
beer
into
the
stratosphere
i
had
this
on
tap
and
it
was
amazing
this
doesnt
quite
measure
up
o
a
really
nice
beer
a
bit
pricey
but
worth
trying
at
least
once
i
appreciate
ruby
johnson
sending
me
this
replacement
beer
for
the
bad
one
that
i
purchased
i
definitely
enjoyed
it
but
can
certainly
see
how
it
would
be
even
more
enjoyable
when
imbibed
from
an
appropriately
carbonated
bottle
or
better
yet
tapkeg
i
would
love
to
try
it
in
this
format
if
i
ever
get
the
chance
but
i
cant
say
that
i
would
necessarily
buy
a
bottle
again
until
i
hear
that
their
carbonation
issues
have
improved
fantastic
stuff
huge
and
incredibly
complex
beer
you
better
love
bourbon
as
it
isnt
subtle
at
all
i
think
i
like
this
a
touch
better
than
the
brandy
barrel
version
while
i
can
live
with
the
near
lack
of
carbonation
some
bubbles
certainly
would
ramp
this
up
a
bit
in
the
appearance
and
mouthfeel
categories
letting
this
warm
up
to
near
room
temperature
really
helped
open
this
up
a
lot
overall
a
delicious
and
complex
yet
very
drinkable
beer
of
course
id
like
some
carbonation
but
the
fact
that
there
isnt
any
leaves
the
beer
feeling
very
velvety
on
the
tongue
this
is
the
perfect
bottle
for
sharing
on
a
special
occasion
and
ill
buy
it
the
next
time
i
see
it
there
was
also
a
heavy
yeast
flavor
that
wasnt
over
powering
but
definitely
noticeable
d
the
difference
between
this
and
the
brandybarrel
aged
version
was
astounding
these
two
really
illuminated
what
a
difference
aging
can
make
this
is
a
very
smooth
drinkable
beer
but
the
bourbon
characteristics
make
it
a
bit
of
a
sipper
2011
vintage
pours
an
extremely
murky
dark
brown
color
with
a
tiny
bit
of
bubbles
no
head
whatsoever
dammit
scent
makes
me
completely
forget
about
the
lack
in
carbonation
with
its
heavenly
aroma
i
quickly
get
smooth
bourbon
and
oak
aromas
with
sweet
vanilla
and
candied
dark
fruits
wow
this
scent
is
just
bursting
with
complexity
and
deliciousness
taste
is
just
as
the
aroma
begins
except
with
a
little
more
dark
fruit
lovely
dark
fruits
with
oak
and
vanilla
some
caramel
as
well
a
bit
of
molasses
with
some
amazing
bourbon
notes
slight
alcohol
burn
but
just
the
right
amount
mouthfeel
is
vinous
not
much
carbonation
at
all
kinda
works
for
this
fullbodied
big
delicious
beer
drinkability
is
fairly
high
as
long
as
i
sip
slowly
to
not
get
too
drunk
overall
i
always
enjoy
a
carbonated
beer
more
than
a
noncarbonated
beer
this
just
happens
to
work
for
this
beer
somewhat
i
would
still
like
it
more
if
it
were
carbonated
but
supposedly
thats
not
what
tomme
is
going
for
with
his
angels
share
in
the
u
s
no
one
knock
a
good
bourbon
case
beer
i
could
just
see
this
becoming
dated
as
a
style
eventually
but
america
likes
there
beer
to
be
manly
so
it
makes
beer
big
i
just
think
that
this
is
getting
typographically
standardize
in
the
end
and
were
disregarding
the
cultivation
of
the
yeast
and
ingredient
relationship
but
then
again
we
have
standardized
yeast
havent
we
overall
this
beer
is
very
very
good
and
should
be
hailed
as
a
great
blend
i
want
to
give
it
a
5
in
this
category
but
find
it
hard
based
on
the
lower
scores
in
appearance
and
mouthfeel
which
stem
from
the
lack
of
carbonation
o
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
ever
tasted
it
compares
favorably
with
dark
lord
westveleteren
utopias
and
is
actually
obtainable
and
affordable
for
mere
mortal
beer
drinkers
make
sure
you
share
it
with
someone
at
12
5
its
a
one
and
done
overall
this
is
very
good
i
hate
to
reiterate
what
everyone
else
has
said
about
the
carbonation
but
it
definitely
needs
more
i
will
buy
this
again
because
the
rest
of
it
offsets
the
lack
of
carbonation
for
me
this
is
a
sipper
i
cant
chug
this
too
fast
d
this
one
no
where
near
resembles
the
brandy
aged
version
which
is
a
good
thing
extremely
high
quality
and
it
hides
its
abv
well
ill
be
having
this
again
wow
what
a
disappointment
after
having
this
on
tap
a
few
months
ago
and
enjoying
it
i
decided
to
buy
a
bottle
i
ignored
beerandraiderfans
warning
and
bought
my
14
99
12
7
oz
bottle
to
his
exact
description
no
carbonation
i
mean
none
i
thought
this
was
only
similar
in
the
aroma
sweet
bourbon
caramel
the
taste
was
off
some
kind
of
acrid
sour
flavor
so
disappointed
in
the
bottle
version
just
for
the
record
on
tap
is
10x
the
beer
poor
bottling
i
had
this
on
tap
a
couple
of
months
ago
and
if
my
memory
server
me
correctly
which
is
not
a
given
by
any
stretch
the
draft
version
was
even
more
delicious
than
this
and
it
was
better
carbonated
and
had
a
better
mouthfeel
still
whatever
age
or
conditions
may
have
done
to
this
particular
bottle
sample
it
is
an
awesome
smelling
delicious
brew
with
great
complexity
and
good
balance
im
down
to
a
couple
or
three
ounces
and
i
wish
there
were
more
dr
highly
drinkable
id
definitely
have
it
again
probably
best
bottle
conditioned
and
aged
o
the
barrel
aging
really
lends
some
very
rich
vanilla
flavors
only
bringing
out
a
slight
booziness
and
a
lighter
body
which
is
expected
after
9
months
in
a
barrel
very
rich
dark
chocolate
tones
with
sugary
caramel
and
bourbon
mingle
together
very
nicely
its
easy
to
see
why
this
bourbon
barrel
strong
ale
is
so
highly
regarded
angels
share
is
truly
a
gift
from
the
heavens
final
thought
15
a
pop
is
really
high
but
like
any
great
beer
wine
or
spirit
well
worth
the
money
it
is
more
of
an
experience
than
a
beer
cheers
one
of
the
more
schizophrenic
beers
ive
had
angels
share
ranges
from
phenomenal
to
drainpour
all
the
versions
on
tap
ive
had
have
been
really
good
i
was
admittedly
apprehensive
of
this
beer
but
after
having
it
i
went
back
and
bought
a
couple
more
to
hold
on
to
and
i
plan
on
buying
a
brandy
version
or
two
shortly
this
is
a
good
beer
not
quite
great
but
certainly
one
i
would
recommend
to
anyone
who
enjoys
bourbon
barrel
aged
beers
odd
side
note
with
the
last
18th
of
the
bottle
i
had
the
crazy
idea
to
eat
a
maple
glazed
doughnut
with
this
and
it
was
probably
one
of
my
favorite
food
and
beer
pairings
that
ive
tried
just
had
to
throw
that
out
there
o
this
would
have
been
an
outstanding
beer
if
there
was
more
carbonation
to
it
however
as
it
is
it
was
still
a
very
good
beer
that
i
would
get
again
if
i
had
the
chance
worth
grabbing
a
glass
of
if
you
see
it
around
poured
into
a
snifter
a
dark
opaque
brown
with
no
head
to
speak
of
other
than
a
few
stray
bubbles
aroma
of
caramel
vanilla
and
oaksoaked
bourbon
taste
was
slick
and
sweet
right
off
the
bat
with
an
obvious
alcohol
kick
dark
malts
and
bourbon
are
dominant
and
balance
each
other
pretty
good
some
subtle
fruit
notes
come
through
fullbodied
strong
but
smooth
and
fairly
drinkable
to
be
savored
slowly
and
definitely
at
a
warmer
temperature
better
if
you
are
a
fan
of
bourbon
obviously
i
did
like
the
brandy
version
of
this
beer
much
better
d
this
is
a
solid
beer
love
the
bourbon
and
vanilla
flavors
in
it
for
some
reason
it
just
seemed
to
fall
a
bit
short
as
a
complete
beer
though
the
price
point
has
kept
me
away
from
it
in
the
past
and
i
think
it
will
continue
to
do
so
in
the
future
finally
got
to
try
this
i
had
been
on
the
look
out
for
it
on
draft
as
i
wasnt
willing
to
chance
a
flat
bottle
but
for
the
high
price
i
probably
wont
seek
it
out
again
overall
an
amazing
beer
from
lost
abbey
nice
balance
of
sweetness
well
complemented
by
the
wooden
notes
a
classic
had
ontap
prethanksgiving
small
5oz
pour
fantastic
strong
bourbon
filled
aroma
that
really
set
the
tone
for
the
beer
nice
malty
taste
with
a
little
bit
of
oakybarrel
flavor
coming
through
and
a
nice
strong
bourbon
finish
kind
of
straddled
the
line
between
a
thick
and
thin
beer
with
aspects
of
both
that
muddled
it
up
a
little
great
overall
beer
but
not
the
most
exceptional
barrel
aged
ris
on
tap
at
beer
revolution
pours
a
very
dark
amber
with
a
small
tan
head
that
disappears
quite
quickly
and
leaves
no
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
big
bourbon
some
leather
caramel
a
bit
of
oak
vanilla
and
a
moderate
amount
of
alcohol
the
initial
taste
is
sweet
with
caramel
and
vanilla
then
comes
some
bourbon
and
a
light
cherry
flavor
the
finish
is
warming
and
leaves
a
lingering
oak
presence
surprisingly
the
taste
is
not
all
that
boozy
mediumfull
body
low
carbonation
this
is
quite
a
tasty
beer
its
sweet
but
not
cloying
im
not
going
to
regularly
pay
the
huge
price
for
bottles
but
it
is
certainly
worth
the
price
when
it
is
found
on
tap
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
was
extremely
pleased
we
got
a
bottle
that
had
some
carbonation
flavors
are
big
and
bold
so
i
appreciate
the
small
bottle
offering
it
is
obvious
that
this
beer
was
crafted
very
delicately
and
aged
to
the
exact
right
time
the
brewer
wanted
flavors
are
huge
but
balanced
between
the
dark
caramelized
malts
and
big
bourbon
boldness
i
enjoyed
this
very
much
and
will
hopefully
have
it
again
down
the
road
recommended
but
a
a
crapshoot
unfortunately
as
many
bottles
dont
have
the
carbonation
i
was
lucky
enough
to
receive
overall
this
is
a
beer
that
borders
on
greatness
i
had
a
less
than
stellar
experience
with
a
flat
brandy
angels
share
bottle
but
the
difference
is
like
night
and
day
from
the
moment
i
had
my
first
whiff
of
it
i
knew
this
was
going
to
be
a
special
beer
the
bourbon
treatment
is
remarkably
well
done
neither
destroying
the
flavor
nor
the
mouthfeel
of
the
base
beer
a
huge
beer
packed
with
taste
and
complexity
for
me
this
is
worth
seeking
out
when
it
is
available
pours
a
dark
murky
brown
with
a
light
tanish
off
white
head
that
laces
the
glass
nicely
the
nose
is
big
of
bourbon
oack
raisins
dates
dark
fruit
and
vanilla
the
taste
is
a
big
hit
of
bourbon
raisins
toffee
dates
oak
canilla
and
a
strong
alcohol
presence
with
a
slight
burntness
its
got
a
creamy
feel
withe
a
fairly
thick
body
and
good
carbonation
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
for
me
however
if
you
dont
like
bourbon
this
definitly
isnt
the
beer
for
you
o
i
was
a
little
let
down
by
this
it
was
decent
but
i
was
expecting
more
this
was
the
2010
version
and
the
bourbon
was
still
pretty
strong
i
was
tempted
to
splurge
the
cash
on
a
bottle
before
but
glad
i
never
did
it
doesnt
get
much
better
than
this
for
sheer
intensity
of
a
beery
sort
on
tap
at
pizza
port
ob
overall
im
a
bit
floored
over
the
whole
experience
a
few
years
ago
this
was
a
bucket
list
beer
for
me
and
im
thrilled
to
have
stumbled
on
it
the
downside
for
me
is
i
feel
like
ive
had
this
beer
before
im
just
getting
tired
of
bourbon
barrel
beers
they
are
all
starting
to
run
together
and
its
not
special
anymore
great
beer
but
i
would
have
appreciated
it
more
3
years
ago
note
live
review
o
well
this
gets
major
points
because
its
actually
somewhat
carbonated
the
bourbon
flavor
is
bold
and
lingers
throughout
the
whole
sip
but
still
is
pretty
tasty
this
is
definitely
a
sipper
d
i
still
use
this
category
as
drinkability
its
12
percent
and
a
killer
not
sessionable
beautiful
on
tap
but
is
usually
flat
in
the
bottle
tried
this
on
draft
in
a
small
snifter
dark
brownblack
with
minimal
foam
the
smell
is
great
malt
chocolate
caramel
and
huge
burbon
it
almost
jumps
out
of
the
glass
at
you
the
taste
is
similarly
great
the
burbon
is
up
front
along
with
coffee
chocolate
and
caramel
the
alcohol
while
not
overpowering
is
present
great
beer
with
tons
on
flavor
when
it
comes
to
taste
the
differences
are
very
subtle
in
the
10
the
bourbon
is
immediate
but
it
does
allow
the
vanilla
and
chocolate
finishes
strong
the
11
is
pretty
much
all
bourbon
from
start
to
finish
overall
this
beer
has
mellowed
a
bit
over
the
past
two
years
there
is
no
carbonationhead
but
the
flavors
are
very
complex
the
mouth
is
enjoyable
with
only
a
hint
of
alcohol
which
is
impressive
for
such
a
high
abv
beer
well
done
d
judging
from
the
aroma
alone
id
have
said
this
tanks
in
drinkability
the
taste
really
makes
up
for
the
nose
in
complexity
character
and
balance
still
its
as
much
a
sipper
as
theres
ever
been
and
my
friend
ended
up
finish
my
final
23
ounces
for
me
this
is
an
extremely
well
done
beer
if
you
have
the
means
get
it
and
try
it
as
to
my
question
of
is
it
worth
the
price
not
with
my
budget
no
but
it
truly
was
worth
the
experience
once
medium
bodied
with
good
carbonation
only
strike
against
it
in
terms
of
drinkable
nature
was
the
bourbon
taste
it
was
a
little
much
at
times
especially
as
the
brew
warmed
still
very
delicious
overall
i
would
have
this
brew
time
and
time
again
i
loved
it
complex
delicious
and
high
quality
i
had
dinner
on
saturday
night
at
the
sunset
cantina
on
comm
ave
and
i
saw
this
little
gem
on
the
just
tapped
list
served
for
9
in
a
chimay
chalice
very
dull
brown
color
no
head
at
all
just
a
pool
of
carbonation
in
the
middle
of
the
head
kinda
lifeless
looking
then
i
took
a
sniff
whoah
theres
some
bourbon
there
very
powerful
and
upfront
the
flavor
doesnt
relent
either
it
might
actually
be
too
strong
i
could
taste
some
hints
of
cherry
and
figs
but
the
booze
flavor
really
dominated
while
i
liked
it
a
lot
i
would
have
preferred
if
it
was
toned
down
a
bit
the
bourbon
barrel
aging
seems
to
be
a
blessing
and
a
curse
for
this
one
perhaps
aging
a
bottle
would
really
be
beneficial
here
but
glad
i
got
to
try
it
on
tap
as
i
had
never
seen
this
one
in
ma
before
o
a
very
complex
beer
which
would
be
awesome
if
there
wouldnt
be
so
much
alcohol
present
might
be
awesome
with
some
age
if
the
alcohol
mellows
verdict
pretty
strong
sipper
here
but
most
importantly
enjoyable
i
did
prefer
the
2010
brandy
version
but
this
vintage
was
done
well
ill
be
excited
to
see
how
my
second
bottle
turns
out
in
a
year
or
so
overall
i
much
preferred
the
brandy
version
to
this
for
considerations
of
cash
and
carbonation
draft
is
the
way
to
go
a
huge
sweet
beer
and
a
pretty
ideal
nightcap
or
midafternoon
cheese
accompaniment
i
thought
this
beer
was
mediocre
for
the
style
it
is
somewhat
one
dimensional
with
a
very
overpowering
sweet
taste
o
this
is
a
great
beer
a
slow
sipper
this
one
strangely
enough
would
be
phenomenal
with
some
french
toast
and
bacon
if
i
didnt
have
church
tomorrow
that
would
be
so
on
the
breakfast
menu
lightly
carbonated
with
a
few
swirls
a
minimal
head
reforms
and
subsides
quickly
definitely
on
the
sweeter
side
of
things
nice
complexity
on
the
nose
and
palate
with
the
aromas
blossoming
and
the
flavors
becoming
more
pronounced
as
the
beer
warmsup
a
bit
o
pretty
good
beer
i
didnt
quite
know
what
to
expect
with
this
one
pretty
good
bourbon
is
very
dominating
and
will
probably
age
well
over
the
next
year
or
two
still
a
little
hot
at
the
moment
wow
let
me
say
i
love
lost
abbey
this
is
a
very
sweet
beer
to
smell
and
taste
smells
bourbon
and
sweet
tastes
very
sweet
get
the
pointvery
sweet
very
caramel
and
fruit
taste
very
much
matches
smell
a
little
stronger
bourbon
than
expected
i
love
it
warms
you
up
a
little
in
the
end
o
if
it
was
carbonated
it
would
be
a
nice
beer
maybe
a
b
not
so
with
this
bottle
o
very
unique
complex
and
interesting
id
be
curious
to
try
the
brandy
and
bourbonaged
varieties
in
one
sitting
to
compare
well
this
started
off
poorly
uncaged
the
beer
and
slowly
coerced
the
cork
out
of
the
neck
of
the
bottle
without
a
single
sound
no
pop
no
formation
of
carbonation
at
the
top
of
the
beer
flat
as
a
pancake
poured
without
any
head
whatsoever
i
hate
to
label
but
flat
abbey
is
appropriate
the
nose
is
real
boozy
wreaks
of
bourbon
however
it
has
a
ton
of
subtleties
to
it
including
chocolate
vanilla
and
bourbon
the
taste
follows
the
nose
nearly
to
a
t
so
i
wont
bother
to
repeat
the
mouthfeel
is
void
of
any
carbonation
whatsoever
whats
strange
about
this
is
it
has
the
mouthfeel
of
a
stout
and
exactly
the
way
i
like
my
stouts
if
this
were
a
stout
id
likely
grade
this
higher
in
the
mouthfeel
and
appearance
departments
i
can
see
this
needing
age
behind
it
but
why
age
a
flat
beer
this
is
so
boozy
without
everything
playing
out
properly
i
dont
see
myself
battling
the
entire
beer
likely
a
drainpour
o
good
beer
bunch
of
extreme
flavors
present
buy
bottles
and
wait
a
year
after
trying
it
fresh
its
good
now
but
seems
like
a
great
candidate
for
aging
d
this
is
good
stuff
but
maybe
a
little
heavy
on
the
bourbon
and
that
hampers
the
drinkability
a
bit
full
body
mild
carbonation
lol
sticky
and
syrupy
on
the
tongue
absolutely
wonderful
flavor
and
scent
and
the
carbonation
seemed
to
hold
up
on
this
one
if
all
angels
share
bottles
were
like
this
id
buy
more
o
this
is
an
interesting
and
wellmade
beer
definitely
worth
a
shot
o
two
wrongs
kind
of
make
a
right
here
its
flat
and
its
sour
either
one
might
have
garnished
a
bad
score
alone
but
i
dont
mind
flat
sours
chalk
this
up
as
my
second
experience
of
flat
abbey
o
this
is
an
interesting
and
wellmade
beer
definitely
worth
a
shot
o
really
impressed
by
this
beer
despite
all
the
negativity
surrounding
it
and
la
enjoy
it
for
what
it
is
and
dont
immediately
proclaim
it
to
be
a
drainpour
o
great
beer
but
the
sweetness
is
too
much
for
me
if
you
like
raisins
than
this
one
trick
pony
is
for
you
i
ended
up
dumping
it
out
ick
overall
the
beer
could
have
been
so
nice
could
because
the
alcohol
is
so
badly
hidden
that
i
can
hardly
distinguish
this
with
a
bottle
of
pure
ethanol
from
my
work
after
the
sour
2009
version
i
will
not
try
this
beer
again
very
dark
with
a
strong
black
cherry
aroma
i
had
this
at
brouwers
in
seattle
during
a
lost
abbey
and
port
tasting
the
initial
drink
is
great
heavy
strong
licurice
and
sweetness
the
finish
was
a
little
funky
this
was
my
first
lost
abbey
and
a
great
way
to
start
off
o
while
delicious
sure
wish
there
was
more
carbonation
i
do
not
understand
isnt
this
supposed
to
have
some
carbonation
if
it
was
more
carbonated
i
would
definitely
score
it
higher
already
afraid
that
i
am
rating
it
higher
than
it
deserves
to
be
certainly
over
priced
if
i
drank
3
of
these
i
would
be
face
down
in
the
gutter
overall
better
than
the
brandy
but
over
priced
o
well
i
have
had
brandy
and
bourbon
version
several
times
i
will
no
longer
be
purchasing
angels
share
tomme
cant
manage
to
do
properly
and
appears
to
be
too
proud
to
make
it
right
poured
hazy
reddish
brown
color
with
an
average
frothy
brown
head
that
mostly
lasted
with
good
lacing
moderate
to
heavy
dark
fruity
toasted
malt
alcohol
and
wood
aroma
medium
to
full
body
with
a
smooth
texture
and
flat
carbonation
moderate
to
heavy
dark
fruit
bittersweet
flavor
with
a
medium
to
heavy
dark
bittersweet
finish
of
moderate
to
long
duration
this
is
a
complex
standout
beer
big
thanks
goes
out
to
my
boy
lunch
for
sending
me
this
one
in
a
past
trade
2010
vintage
tasted
backtobacktoback
with
brandy
and
grand
cru
served
from
bottle
into
a
surly
darkness
snifter
poured
a
deep
murky
brown
with
a
basically
nonexistant
offwhite
head
maintained
nice
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
caramel
wood
dark
fruit
dark
chocolate
and
sweet
alcohol
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
caramel
wood
sweet
alcohol
and
dark
fruit
it
had
a
heavy
feel
on
the
palate
with
mild
carbonation
overall
this
brew
was
pretty
tasty
this
is
one
of
those
instances
that
you
can
tell
that
the
beer
had
sat
in
bourbon
barrels
rather
than
just
knowing
that
it
was
in
a
barrel
really
good
flavor
and
aroma
going
on
in
this
one
i
was
honestly
afraid
when
i
cracked
the
top
on
this
one
and
didnt
hear
a
pop
from
the
cork
was
also
concerned
when
there
was
basically
no
head
formation
however
this
one
turned
out
quite
well
and
was
really
enjoyable
thanks
to
ken
for
sharing
a
bottle
of
this
one
at
schmittymacks
first
tasting
one
closer
to
ratman
with
the
double
tick
poured
a
rich
dark
brown
color
with
a
light
brown
head
aromas
of
bourbon
raisins
figs
oak
and
vanilla
on
the
palate
this
one
was
full
bodied
with
flavors
of
bourbon
vanilla
dark
fruits
and
alcohol
overall
this
is
just
average
the
lack
of
carbonation
just
kills
this
o
this
one
is
a
bit
tastier
than
the
other
one
but
theyre
almost
identical
in
aroma
and
flavor
still
a
damn
fine
ale
overall
a
good
beer
with
nice
interplay
of
flavors
and
a
well
integrated
bourbon
barrel
flavor
that
allows
the
beer
to
dominate
o
if
youre
a
huge
bourbon
fan
this
one
is
for
you
i
cant
really
touch
hard
liquor
so
its
not
for
me
definite
sipper
plus
i
paid
i
think
16
bucks
for
a
375
ml
bottle
thats
insanity
i
guess
this
batch
was
still
due
to
bottling
problems
when
they
started
using
the
12
7oz
rather
than
the
750ml
but
i
am
still
really
glad
i
got
to
try
it
i
defiantly
experienced
some
flavors
and
sensations
that
are
normally
a
little
harder
to
detect
i
certainly
would
like
to
try
the
carbonated
version
but
im
not
complaining
about
this
accident
overall
i
had
this
a
couple
of
times
on
tap
and
wish
this
had
the
carbonation
levels
of
that
still
sitting
at
home
and
being
able
to
concentrate
on
the
beer
you
really
get
a
feel
for
all
of
the
complexity
in
this
it
really
is
a
very
good
beer
i
dont
know
if
the
price
warrants
buying
it
very
often
more
likely
whenever
i
see
it
on
tap
i
will
go
for
it
overall
i
was
not
much
impressed
by
this
one
particularly
considering
the
price
tag
i
dont
think
ive
ever
poured
a
beer
so
almost
completely
flat
right
out
of
the
bottle
high
abv
explains
this
to
a
degree
but
some
carbonation
would
have
helped
the
mouthfeel
and
would
have
also
concealed
the
booze
a
bit
and
provided
more
balance
this
beer
pours
an
almost
black
color
with
very
little
head
the
smell
was
malty
and
a
bit
strong
on
the
alchool
the
taste
was
increabily
complex
there
was
changes
of
coffee
choclate
toffee
oat
flavors
the
taste
was
very
strong
and
stayed
on
your
paltetee
for
a
while
overall
this
was
a
good
beer
it
was
very
differnlty
and
didnt
have
much
a
beer
flvaor
much
more
like
a
sipping
liquer
but
still
good
overall
a
good
beer
i
am
so
glad
it
was
not
completely
flat
or
infected
i
enjoy
it
though
i
do
not
know
if
the
risk
of
the
aforementioned
problems
is
worth
the
dollar
amount
a
lot
of
alcohol
warmth
i
would
love
this
on
a
cold
winter
night
did
a
side
by
side
with
the
brandy
i
liked
the
brandy
better
but
this
was
still
a
very
solid
offering
an
astounding
beera
beer
that
makes
you
stop
and
think
and
appreciate
the
liquid
inside
your
glass
sublime
nirvana
burgundy
in
color
the
angels
share
has
appreciable
notes
of
caramel
and
vanilla
followed
by
a
big
bourbon
kick
from
the
barrel
aging
with
a
hint
of
dark
fruit
at
the
finish
the
oaky
bourbon
character
of
this
ale
makes
the
alcohol
content
very
noticeable
so
the
angels
share
wont
sneak
up
on
you
this
is
the
beer
that
you
will
savor
at
the
end
of
the
evening
o
i
have
had
this
ontap
and
it
was
much
better
than
this
the
flavors
are
complex
and
very
enjoyable
but
it
is
just
way
too
hot
once
it
tones
down
a
bit
this
will
be
a
great
beer
but
at
the
moment
it
is
still
too
raw
wow
what
a
beautiful
complex
unique
beer
similar
appearance
and
aroma
thicker
flavor
profile
with
more
caramel
and
molasses
sweetness
which
has
the
side
effect
of
elevating
the
chocolate
in
the
profile
id
bump
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
up
half
a
point
each
on
this
vintage
appearance
is
dark
brown
with
just
a
couple
specks
of
foam
the
lost
abbey
has
an
aroma
of
vanilla
bourbon
some
oak
upon
sipping
i
taste
raisins
alcohol
malt
some
butterscotch
for
the
barrel
aging
and
other
characteristics
of
this
beer
it
is
well
balanced
the
end
has
some
warm
booze
a
very
good
beer
to
cap
your
evening
sampled
at
hellbillys

tasting
bottle
courtesy
of
sparky27
bockyhorsey
let
me
start
off
by
saying
all
three
of
you
are
gentlemen
and
scholars
this
was
the
big
winner
of
the
night
it
began
with
a
pop
and
a
thick
caramel
head
slowly
climbing
out
of
the
top
of
the
bottle
incredible
rusty
brew
with
yeasty
bits
floating
throughout
the
glass
oak
molasses
vanilla
and
toffee
all
playfully
fighting
for
attention
flavor
is
extremely
complex
with
various
dark
fruits
chocolate
and
mild
bourbon
unlike
other
barrelaged
beers
this
one
isnt
overpowered
by
the
whisky
but
instead
accentuates
the
brews
other
qualities
delicious
refined
and
exceptional
jd
o
this
particular
vintage
is
less
than
average
for
style
and
abysmal
for
its
price
the
other
two
vintages
i
sampled
last
night
are
complete
failures
by
any
measure
given
the
above
i
will
not
purchase
angels
share
in
the
future
and
most
likely
avoid
it
entirely
avoid
yeah
a
big
feisty
bitch
with
a
sweet
beguiling
outer
facade
dangerous
bewitching
demonwoman
beer
wow
wow
wow
from
inauspicious
beginnings
and
much
undercarbonation
this
managed
to
blow
me
away
its
gorgeous
supple
and
incredibly
complex
what
a
brew
not
sure
how
often
id
actually
buy
it
though
because
of
the
price
o
a
little
disappointed
had
the
brandy
version
a
while
back
and
i
was
very
pleased
i
hope
this
will
mellow
some
with
age
the
flavors
are
there
it
is
just
not
the
right
time
yet
to
consume
d
this
had
the
perfect
combination
and
balance
of
flavors
for
a
bourbon
ale
very
delicious
and
complex
the
body
was
decent
could
have
been
fuller
and
the
alcohol
wasnt
very
noticeable
so
it
was
pretty
easy
to
sip
but
should
never
be
drunk
any
faster
lots
of
potential
for
aging
this
one
excellent
beer
overall
this
was
a
really
great
tasting
beer
i
think
a
year
or
two
of
aging
would
do
wonders
for
this
beer
a
great
sipping
beer
overall
good
beer
glad
i
have
had
it
at
this
age
but
would
rather
have
it
young
overall
delicious
slow
sipper
good
bottle
to
spend
an
hour
or
two
with
or
to
split
two
to
three
ways
not
sure
if
it
is
worth
the
price
tag
but
definitely
a
well
crafted
beer
a
good
beer
for
the
cellar
should
age
gracefully
its
a
big
beer
and
a
sipper
to
be
sure
clearly
displayed
alcohol
is
not
normally
something
i
find
pleasant
or
acceptable
but
it
works
here
and
ive
certainly
tasted
hotter
beers
it
reminds
me
in
many
ways
of
sam
adams
triple
bock
which
as
been
shunned
on
beeradvocate
currently
scoring
a
c
mediocre
with
569
reviews
how
that
can
be
like
a
fresh
layer
of
varnish
on
wood
smells
like
i
would
imagine
a
port
aged
in
bourbon
barrels
would
smell
lots
of
grape
touriga
nacional
raisin
in
the
same
way
at
a
fine
sherry
doesnt
need
carbonation
but
the
possibility
of
improvement
forces
me
to
reduce
the
5
i
gave
to
flavor
down
to
4
5
just
wish
it
had
carbonation
i
will
seek
out
other
vintages

i
like

the

across

it
grows
on
me
and
feels
very
earthy
it
is
also
very

the

is
better

a

i

it

would
have
been

if
it

overall
a

i

have
to
be
honest
this
is
not
the
most
attractive
beer
i
have
ever
laid
eyes
on
it
is
an
opaque
dark
brown
color
with
just
a
ring
of
tan
bubbles
around
the
edge
it
pretty
much
looks
like

then
again
only
now
do
i
see
why
if
youre
one
who
hasnt
pulled
the

because
of

you
should
definitely
try
it
at

once

nearly
syrupy
on

and
the

this

its
not

easy

feel
like
other

passed
this
one

its
a

thin
lots
of
hot
bourbon
it
does
mellow
towards
the
finish
bourbon
youradhere
d
my
first
experience
with
angel
share
this
was
a
sheer
delight
to
taste
very
much
a
sipping
beer
id
rank
this
up
with
any
barley
wine
or
after
dinner
cordial
d
an
interesting
sipper
that
i
enjoyed
trying
however
its
definitely
not
worth
the
31
50
i
paid
for
this
750
ml
bottle
now
that
it
comes
in
smaller
bottles
id
probably
give
a
newer
vintage
another
go
this
beer
along
with
its
brandy
aged
cousin
have
caught
a
lot
of
flack
for
carbonation
issues
on
this
site
so
lets
see
how
this
years
version
came
out
the
cork
comes
out
with
a
light
pop
better
than
none
i
suppose
and
pours
out
a
deep
dark
brown
with
just
lacing
as
far
as
heading
is
concerned
my
first
thought
is
that
while
there
may
not
be
a
whole
lot
of
carbonation
at
least
there
is
some
anyway
nose
is
amazing
with
huge
bourbon
characters
chocolate
caramel
brown
sugar
and
dark
fruit
bourbon
caramel
and
molasses
dominate
the
taste
with
tiny
hints
of
earth
as
well
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
boozy
but
curbed
at
the
same
time
by
the
carbonation
that
is
there
this
is
not
really
a
bad
thing
in
my
opinion
as
this
beer
acts
more
like
a
spirit
than
most
others
and
deserves
to
be
sipped
and
savored
drinking
this
beer
is
a
wonderful
experience
but
i
warn
you
to
take
it
slow
as
it
has
kicked
my
ass
on
more
than
one
occasion
when
having
it
out
at
a
bar
final
thoughts
are
that
despite
all
the
criticism
of
lost
abbey
for
the
carbonation
thing
on
last
years
brandy
and
bourbon
batches
this
beer
is
literally
unlike
any
other
even
with
zero
fizz
this
beer
is
a
wonder
to
drink
would
i
like
some
more
carbonation
yes
for
sure
but
it
is
still
one
of
the
most
interesting
and
complex
beers
on
the
general
market
right
now
imo
now
all
i
need
to
do
is
try
the
grand
cru
version
of
this
brew
and
i
am
good
to
go
cheers
i
could
definitely
spend
a
few
hours
on
these
12
7
ounces
certainly
an
experience
though
not
one
i
could
afford
to
have
often
angels
share
is
a
fitting
name
for
this
heavenly
ale
tiny
head
but
no
head
needed
for
this
fine
sipper
when
then
chalice
was
tilted
only
slightly
it
took
literally
almost
30
seconds
for
the
last
bubbles
to
reach
the
surface
and
i
only
tilted
it
enough
to
show
a
14
inch
of
lace
a
lexicon
of
flavors
show
in
the
nose
and
taste
one
of
the
most
complex
and
well
crafted
brews
ive
come
across
molasses
figs
caramelized
candi
sugar
plum
chocolate
covered
dark
cherries
and
bourbon
much
more
carbonation
was
low
and
the
mouthfeel
was
pure
velvet
perfect
im
on
my
way
to
grab
more
this
weekend
dont
be
scared
to
drink
it
fresh
i
know
it
can
be
cellard
but
its
hard
to
imagine
an
improvement
over
this
d
i
have
a
hard
time
choosing
which
i
like
better
the
brandy
or
the
bourbon
but
luckily
both
of
them
are
generally
available
and
neither
is
a
bad
choice
fullbodied
and
smooth
but
it
feels
a
bit
dull
in
the
mouth
as
it
is
as
flat
as
insert
something
that
makes
a
dirty
joke
out
of
this
its
good
just
not
shit
my
pants
good
30
for
a
25
7
oz
bottle
in
stores
but
just
6
for
a
10
ounce
draft
about
15
for
25
7
oz
on
draft
what
gives
d
ive
only
had
tasters
in
the
past
and
have
wanted
to
have
a
full
pour
of
this
its
weird
to
have
a
beer
ontap
thats
much
cheaper
than
in
the
bottle
this
is
good
but
for
angels
share
it
looks
like
brandy
is
the
way
to
go
my
palate
is
clearly
gravitating
towards
the
brandy
barrel
aged
beers
but
i
certainly
enjoyed
this
this
is
an
intense
full
flavored
beer
thats
easy
to
drink
it
needs
more
carbonation
but
otherwise
what
a
great
beer
overall
a
little
disappointed
here
the
bourbon
is
better
than
the
brandy
version
but
the
grand
cru
dominates
them
both
its
not
even
funny
a
couple
minor
changes
and
this
could
be
really
good
d
i
shared
this
bottle
on
my
birthday
which
was
an
awesome
birthday
present
but
i
was
left
a
little
disappointed
the
beer
starts
off
with
nice
flavors
but
the
oak
bourbon
age
just
got
to
me
beer
poured
a
deep
rich
brown
no
head
not
even
lacing
aroma
of
dark
fruits
caramel
molasses
a
mild
oakieness
also
the
taste
was
definitely
of
the
dark
fruits
from
the
aroma
and
the
alcohol
comes
in
to
play
not
too
sweet
again
not
too
boozey
after
this
glass
warmed
to
room
temperature
the
taste
was
more
prevalent
of
the
flavours
i
recommend
drinking
this
at
room
temp
to
appreciate
all
the
flavours
of
the
fruits
as
well
as
the
sweetness
of
the
caramel
and
molasses
port
brewing
does
it
again
dont
drink
and
review
great
stuff
another
well
done
barrel
aged
beer
from
lost
abbey
d
overall
i
really
like
this
one
but
it
was
a
little
hot
im
a
big
bourbon
fan
so
loved
the
smell
and
taste
and
would
definitely
like
to
try
this
one
again
drinkability
is
average
not
nearly
as
exciting
as
i
hoped
this
is
way
over
priced
im
glad
i
only
spent
9
on
a
draft
then
30
on
a
bottle
i
will
definitely
never
bother
with
this
again
unless
the
price
comes
way
down
in
line
with
the
plethora
of
other
bourbon
barrel
aged
bombers
810
3
times
the
cost
and
average
for
the
style
d
i
thought
this
was
a
damn
good
beer
however
the
heat
is
a
little
much
and
the
abv
shows
through
more
than
many
other
beers
ive
had
375ml
2009
bottle
dark
nearly
black
pour
with
some
mahogany
highlights
and
no
carbonation
very
rich
dark
fruit
with
notes
of
vanilla
bean
oak
and
alcoholic
bourbon
theres
also
some
hints
of
tobacco
and
black
tea
the
flavor
is
almost
too
rich
at
first
but
as
it
rolls
past
your
tongue
it
leaves
wonderful
notes
of
dates
oak
cognac
vanilla
bourbon
and
a
nice
alcohol
kick
on
the
end
the
body
is
oily
and
full
with
no
carbonation
and
strong
alcohol
warming
d
if
not
for
the
price
and
availability
i
could
sit
down
and
drive
a
few
bottles
of
this
in
an
evening
and
then
sleep
very
very
soundly
375
ml
sent
by
jmbh
pours
very
dark
brown
with
no
head
thickish
like
a
malted
milkshake
some
bourbon
and
chocolate
aroma
and
voila
it
taste
like
well
integrated
chocolate
and
bourbon
neither
overpowering
the
other
nicley
drinkable
its
like
an
aged
old
imperial
stout
and
without
the
booziness
apparent
dangerously
drinkable
10
oz
pour
ofthis
is
more
than
enough
very
enjoyable
very
boost
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
standard
pint
glass
lots
of
head
beer
smells
slightly
sweet
but
really
strong
liquor
beer
is
brown
dark
brown
there
isnt
much
to
say
about
it
really
it
was
sweet
strong
mostly
liquor
tasting
but
surprisingly
drinkable
whatever
the
base
of
this
bal
aged
beer
is
it
was
overwhelmed
by
the
aging
process
im
curious
if
it
was
aged
in
wet
barrels
375ml
bottle
2009
dark
brown
with
almost
no
head
bourbon
dried
fruit
soy
sauce
wood
and
caramel
in
the
aroma
the
flavor
is
smoother
and
lacks
the
oxidized
soy
notes
of
the
aroma
lots
of
dried
fruit
tobacco
toasty
grain
some
chocolate
and
oak
rich
and
alcoholic
but
not
harsh
thick
and
flat
on
the
tongue
great
flavor
and
immensely
complex
but
the
weird
oxidized
soy
notes
in
aroma
and
lack
of
bubbles
hurt
it
overall
d
very
complex
with
powerful
yet
complementary
flavors
a
big
hit
and
id
love
to
drink
this
one
again
ill
try
again
next
year
perhaps
i
think
lost
abbey
does
make
some
great
beers
so
i
am
not
on
a
smear
campaign
see
my
other
reviews
for
many
praises
but
this
beer
is
flat
undrinkable
sure
its
a
sipper
but
its
a
well
crafted
beer
looks
and
smells
great
d
a
very
tasty
beer
that
is
busting
with
flavor
a
real
sipper
drinks
pretty
easy
for
the
abv
style
but
to
be
be
sipped
for
sure
not
the
best
barrel
aged
ale
ive
ever
had
but
in
the
top
20
percentile
at
the
very
least
had
higher
expectations
but
i
am
always
thrilled
to
get
to
try
any
all
well
made
big
beers
i
kind
of
put
this
on
a
par
with
new
hollands
dragons
milk
which
is
not
even
half
the
price
would
love
to
try
this
on
tap
a
little
to
no
pop
on
the
cork
which
followed
with
very
light
to
no
carbonation
deep
ruby
to
black
in
color
slight
viscosity
is
detected
from
the
movement
of
the
beer
in
the
glass
4
25
s
intense
aromas
the
oak
is
very
evident
and
provides
a
nice
vanilla
to
the
nose
as
well
as
obvious
whisky
smells
from
the
bourbon
barrel
aging
there
is
also
a
marked
sweetness
that
borders
on
sherry
to
chocolate
covered
cherries
also
signs
of
caramel
and
coconut
5
00
t
intense
raisin
and
date
alcohol
is
upfront
which
isnt
all
that
surprising
considering
that
the
beer
is
12
5
the
vanilla
oak
and
whisky
that
were
rampant
on
the
nose
come
through
on
the
palate
there
is
also
a
strong
holiday
fruit
cake
soaked
in
whisky
taste
i
taste
a
hint
of
hops
but
it
is
really
lost
in
all
the
malts
and
bourbon
barrel
4

m
the
low

this
beer
a

d
insanely
complex
oodles
going
on
in
this
beer
only
a
fraction
of
which
i
feel
like
im
capturing
this
is
the
beer
i
wanted
to
ring
in
2010
and
it
does
not
disappoint
the
high
alcohol
does
keep
it
in
the
sipping
range
4
50
pours
dark
brown
with
no
head
this
one
is
definitely
flat
aroma
is
a
combination
of
roasted
malts
and
bourbon
with
maybe
come
chocolate
and
caramel
mixed
in
the
flavor
is
lots
of
bourbon
oak
and
vanilla
with
some
alcohol
roasted
malt
and
chocolatecoffee
a
very
complex
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
hurt
by
the
fact
the
beer
is
flat
as
a
pancake
still
it
is
pretty
drinkable
and
a
good
beer
overall
i
think
it
would
be
better
with
proper
carbonation
all
in
all
the
lack
of
carbonation
didnt
bother
me
really
theres
plenty
to
like
about
angels
share
in
the
noncarbonated
bottle
i
didnt
finish
it
but
i
enjoyed
it
i
recommend
splitting
it
with
a
few
buddies
approach
it
like
a
nice
scotch
this
manages
to
avoid
being
a
complete
fail
even
with
the
glaring
defects
but
i
think
its
fair
to
expect
much
more
from
a
near
30
bottle
of
beer
from
such
a
respected
brewer
i
used
to
think
people
were
whining
unnecessarily
about
flat
lost
abbey
beers
but
now
i
kind
of
get
it
still
this
is
only
my
second
bottle
with
carbonation
problems
out
of
many
dozen
from
lost
abbey
over
the
years
the
only
other
problem
beer
being
an
08
ten
commandments
so
im
far
from
ready
to
boycott
this
brewer
the
way
some
seem
to
be
im
hoping
to
try
this
beer
on
tap
some
day
so
i
can
truly
experience
it
at
its
full
potential
really
big
beer
but
i
just
need
more
than
the
vaguest
hint
of
carbonation
to
make
this
work
right
poured
with
zero
head
color
is
opaque
dark
brownblack
aroma
is
so
decadently
rich
whiskey
malty
coffee
cocoa
sin
fecund
earth
worked
leather
turkish
tobacco
and
sinful
love
flavs
about
the
same
heady
roasty
and
chocolate
too
killer
man
what
an
expression
of
beer
overall
an
amazing
beer
so
complex
youre
sure
to
taste
something
new
when
you
sale
up
in
the
morning
i
have
had
some
really
good
beers
in
my
time
here
on
ba
and
this
is
a
bold
bold
statement
but
this
is
by
far
the
best
beer
i
have
ever
had
so
glad
that
i
received
another
in
a
trade
recently
on
tap
at
big
wood
brouwers
have
had
previously
as
well
very
dark
almost
black
little
bit
of
carbonation
definitely
not
flat
which
ive
been
hearing
is
a
serious
problem
with
this
in
the
bottles
the
last
bottle
i
had
did
have
decent
carbonation
as
well
maybe
i
got
lucky
smells
like
brandy
with
a
little
caramel
and
chocolate
hiding
in
there
the
cold
taste
was
not
very
revealing
but
when
this
baby
warmed
up
it
came
alive
the
alcohol
lingers
all
throughout
each
sip
and
plays
well
with
others
the
caramel
chocolate
a
spot
of
vanilla
bourbon
fun
stuff
warm
it
is
very
enjoyable
always
happy
to
have
some
lost
abbey
always
lucky
to
not
be
disappointed
i
just
wish
wed
had
a
table
at
that
time
so
i
couldve
ordered
something
else
while
letting
it
warm
overall
this
is
pretty
awful
i
cant
see
what
the
hype
is
with
this
beer
maybe
this
was
flat
i
dont
know
if
this
is
what
its
supposed
to
taste
like
then
god
help
anyone
that
tries
to
finish
a
bottle
if
its
a
bad
bottle
one
of
many
from
lost
abbey
then
that
would
make
my
fourth
bottle
of
different
variety
that
i
have
had
which
was
a
waste
of
money
if
i
wanted
to
waste
money
on
a
tease
id
drop
35
at
a
titty
bar
im
done
with
lost
abbey
lets
pull
the
pin
on
the
hype
train
for
this
brewery
flat
or
not
flat
this
one
simply
sucked
bottle
poured
a
clear
deep
brown
color
ale
with
a
medium
foamy
head
with
little
to
no
retention
and
no
lacing
aroma
of
bourbon
with
light
vanilla
and
balanced
sweet
rich
malt
taste
is
a
well
balanced
mix
between
some
deep
rich
english
style
malt
with
light
dry
fruits
and
with
great
notes
of
bourbon
and
light
vanilla
body
is
fuller
then
average
with
very
low
carbonation
but
still
enough
to
be
enjoyable
with
no
apparent
alcohol
which
is
surprising
considering
the
clear
notes
of
bourbon
not
bad
thought
not
sure
it
is
worth
the
price
tag
or
should
be
ion
the
top
50
but
glad
i
tried
it
anyway
wonderfully
complex
and
i
dont
know
what
bourbon
is
used
not
listed
on
site
but
its
a
nice
one
and
with
a
great
malty
richness
a
treat
and
one
to
seek
out
if
you
are
a
lover
of
bourbonbarrelaged
beer
d
12
is
on
the
high
side
a
touch
boozy
but
not
overpowering
for
what
this
is
it
is
rather
drinkable
split
the
375ml
bottle
and
it
is
just
about
right
probably
could
finish
the
375
on
my
own
but
not
any
more
for
a
high
alcohol
beer
this
is
pretty
smooth
not
hot
but
noticable
alcohol
very
good
overall
in
all
im
very
happy
to
have
had
the
chance
to
try
this
one
and
i
was
impressed
not
the
flat
mess
that
was
older
viscosity
thanks
again
paul
the
beer
doesnt
live
up
to
the
hype
but
its
still
pretty
tasty
in
short
it
was
a
large
snifter
of
bourbon
candy
the
character
was
rich
and
sweet
but
the
flavors
were
too
smooth
making
it
hard
to
pick
out
many
flavors
it
came
off
a
little
dull
for
such
a
big
beer
the
bourbon
character
dominated
and
as
it
warmed
the
alcohol
began
to
emerge
im
glad
i
tried
this
beer
but
wished
it
had
approached
everything
id
heard
about
it
damazing
a
must
have
in
a
class
of
its
own
yes
this
was
third
course
09
bgbbd
sierra
just
sick
to
know
that
it
was
the
bourbon
instead
of
the
brandy
so
dark
and
happy
ive
had
the
bourbon
in
bottle
before
and
loved
it
and
this
was
no
exception
poured
dark
with
little
head
aromas
were
huge
so
much
vanilla
like
i
remembered
it
and
thank
god
i
got
a
snifter
of
this
at
the
end
went
down
too
smooth
and
easy
i
could
care
less
about
carb
issues
this
was
almost
complete
and
for
me
was
up
there
with
bbvd
ba
boris
and
noreaster
cl
for
best
bourbon
brews
the
looks
of
this
pour
are
fairly
unremarkable
very
dark
brown
near
black
with
a
thin
light
brown
head
that
has
little
retention
and
leaves
no
lacing
aroma
is
exceptional
very
strong
and
nuanced
balance
of
bourbon
oak
molasses
vanilla
etc
very
sweet
and
boozy
almost
overwhelming
in
strength
flavor
is
very
similar
to
the
nose
primarily
bourbon
and
oak
flavors
with
a
caramel
malt
backbone
trying
to
poke
through
alcohol
is
obviously
present
though
not
uncomfortably
so
finish
has
strong
lingering
bourbon
taste
mild
notes
of
dark
fruits
raisins
slightly
spicy
no
problems
with
carbonation
in
this
serving
full
bodied
very
smooth
and
pleasing
on
the
palate
for
the
complexity
and
booziness
of
this
beer
compared
to
others
of
similar
styles
this
is
very
drinkable
but
this
goes
without
saying
this
is
obviously
a
sipper
for
sharing
on
tap
the
carbonation
is
spot
on
and
the
mouthfeel
is
viscous
silky
and
smooth
unbelievable
stuff
its
a
real
shame
about
the
2009
bottles
like
i
said
i
would
love
to
try
this
on
tap
i
think
it
would
rocket
up
the
charts
for
me
the
carbonation
is
just
too
low
for
me
out
of
the
bottle
i
cant
imagine
what
the
infamous
undercarbonated
brandy
version
is
like
d
so
delicious
so
complex
id
suffer
an
untold
number
of
hangovers
to
drink
this
every
day
beers
like
this
make
the
u
s
the
greatest
country
brewingwise
in
the
world
it
also
is
a
reminder
that
the
lost
abbey
is
world
class
bottle
2008
pours
an
iced
tea
brown
with
no
head
at
all
no
lacing
also
as
figures
has
a
sweet
aroma
of
bourbonwood
vanilla
and
caramel
has
a
very
light
carbonation
the
flavor
is
thick
and
alcoholic
has
sweet
malts
and
a
good
burn
to
it
has
an
oily
texture
the
body
is
full
has
a
strong
finish
with
a
sour
aftertaste
shared
this
with
friends
and
it
has
good
points
but
seems
to
miss
alittle
this
is
actually
quite
drinkable
as
well
for
a
beer
of
its
magnitude
i
probably
wont
buy
another
flat
bottle
but
i
did
happen
to
enjoy
it
quite
a
bit
i
just
want
to
wait
until
this
beer
is
in
its
true
form
before
i
give
it
another
shot
d
definitely
not
a
beer
i
consider
highly
drinkable
but
considering
the
style
it
is
for
me
i
consider
it
great
since
it
is
so
complex
but
really
one
is
plenty
as
it
comes
off
sweet
from
such
low
carbonation
and
the
12
is
apparent
w
a
tannic
bourbon
hint
i
am
glad
i
tried
this
and
recommend
it
if
you
see
it
dont
hesitate
d
in
the
end
there
is
just
too
much
bourbon
coming
through
in
the
flavor
to
make
this
more
than
a
once
in
a
blue
moon
beer
it
took
me
quite
a
bit
of
time
to
finish
my
five
ounce
pour
glad
to
get
this
on
the
cheap
as
opposed
to
shelling
out
for
a
big
bottle
that
id
struggle
to
finish
md
this
one
is
thick
and
chewy
the
feel
is
a
kinda
hot
on
the
way
down
but
that
is
expected
just
from
the
hugeness
of
this
beer
it
probably
would
of
been
much
hotter
if
not
for
the
huge
body
and
malt
build
the
carbonation
is
low
but
not
lifeless
off
of
the
tap
i
cant
comment
on
the
bottle
version
as
i
dont
have
one
this
is
a
huge
beer
that
demands
time
be
put
into
it
a
slow
sipper
for
sure
after
i
was
done
my
glass
i
really
did
not
want
to
indulge
with
any
more
an
excellent
beer
of
course
though
without
doubt
a
little
bit
goes
a
long
way
pours
a
deep
brownblack
nose
is
alcohol
dark
fruits
and
heavenly
goodness
taste
is
dark
fruit
caramel
and
something
else
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
this
is
definitely
a
sipper
but
one
that
is
lovely
to
experience
despite
some
alcohol
in
the
nose
it
is
hidden
well
at
serving
temp
but
emerges
to
create
more
hotness
as
it
warms
this
is
a
sipper
but
just
a
little
thin
in
the
mouthfeel
for
me
also
you
cannot
do
more
than
2
helpings
of
this
in
a
night
itll
floor
you
as
it
did
me
just
an
awesome
allaround
beer
d
the
no
carbonation
thing
is
a
huge
flaw
in
this
beer
but
it
had
its
moments
the
abv
makes
this
a
sipper
either
way
i
would
love
to
try
this
again
if
it
was
properly
carbonated
30
is
pretty
steep
but
if
you
like
port
wines
or
like
other
beers
like
papier
this
is
right
up
your
alley
d
a
very
complex
beer
and
good
overall
with
some
carbonation
and
a
heavier
body
this
beer
would
receive
perfect
scores
thanks
jnn4v
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
for
the
style
i
dont
think
big
strong
ales
and
stouts
have
to
be
carbed
up
to
be
pleasurable
but
a
little
carbonation
wouldnt
hurt
either
the
alcohol
is
very
present
throughout
this
might
get
better
with
age
but
all
that
bourbon
might
take
over
as
well
its
hard
to
say
the
intense
bourbon
and
alcohol
flavors
make
this
a
sipper
and
not
a
beer
that
i
am
anxious
to
revisit
edit
i
had
this
on
tap
in
2007
for
the
first
time
and
noted
how
flat
it
was
and
liked
it
i
also
like
this
years
flat
santas
and
older
it
just
somehow
didnt
work
out
for
this
beer
like
it
should
have
recommended
if
you
have
30
to
blow
otherwise
youll
find
beers
this
good
in
the
1015
range
drinkability
suffers
because
it
has
no
carbonation
its
like
drinking
wine
or
some
other
beverage
than
beer
that
isnt
carbonated
like
many
others
i
want
my
30
back
the
angels
share
was
definitely
one
of
the
most
bourbonrich
brews
i
have
ever
tried
while
i
loved
the
flavor
and
aroma
i
found
the
intensity
of
the
alcohol
to
be
distracting
a
bit
more
time
in
the
cellar
perhaps
might
help
it
mellow
out
small
pop
of
cork
poured
into
rr
ba
glass
flat
as
a
10
year
old
girl
dark
brown
like
a
cup
of
coffee
good
flavor
but
very
sad
tasting
the
beer
is
crying
c
d
this
is
good
stuff
but
maybe
a
little
heavy
on
the
bourbon
and
that
hampers
the
drinkability
a
bit
i
got
the
beer
at
water
street
wines
in
peoria
il
and
i
think
they
have
more
but
i
know
that
they
did
not
make
much
of
this
great
stuff
a
very
drinkable
but
boozy
strong
ale
d
and
overall
impression
drinkability
is
ok
for
a
beer
of
this
strength
but
the
lack
of
sufficient
carbonation
and
and
the
high
abv
will
limit
it
a
little
overall
i
think
this
is
a
good
beer
although
i
think
there
are
many
other
ba
offerings
out
there
that
are
supierior
skal
pours
very
dark
brown
to
almost
black
no
head
at
all
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aromas
are
intense
as
i
whiff
the
vanilla
upfront
also
licorice
brown
sugar
and
molasses
the
taste
is
powerful
i
can
definitely
taste
the
vanilla
and
oak
upfront
strong
alcohol
taste
that
lingers
in
the
finish
some
residual
sweetness
the
body
is
a
little
thin
and
i
think
the
finish
is
a
little
too
alcoholic
that
lasts
way
too
long
overall
good
beer
not
necessarily
a
favorite
though
thanks
to
juicestam
for
sharing
this
treat
out
here
in
the
middle
of
the
pacific
d
not
all
that
drinkable
at
the
moment
a
great
experiment
but
not
something
that
really
capture
my
tastebuds
and
keeps
them
longing
for
more
bottle
2008
i
think
bottle
a
dark
brown
with
a
thick
tan
head
aroma
of
cohcolate
roasted
malt
and
bourbon
flavor
of
sharp
bourbon
initially
some
buttery
popcorn
too
hmm
i
like
the
aroma
but
the
flavor
is
too
bourbony
overall
ok
but
not
great
mike
bottle
pours
very
dark
brown
color
with
tan
head
that
laces
and
lasts
the
entire
glass
aroma
is
bourbon
oak
vanilla
and
earth
tones
has
a
heavy
body
flavor
is
oak
bourbon
alcohol
caramel
malts
add
a
nice
sweetness
overall
this
is
a
brew
that
lives
up
to
the
hype
i
had
read
reports
that
this
was
beginning
to
sour
so
i
decided
to
open
it
not
with
this
one
not
a
single
sour
note
the
flavors
meld
together
nicely
this
would
have
been
even
better
given
more
time
ddefinitely
for
sipping
i
saved
this
one
for
4
months
at
75
waiting
for
it
to
carbonate
the
cork
came
out
without
a
pop
it
pours
a
dark
cloudy
brown
with
the
slightest
of
bubbles
clawing
their
way
to
the
surface
tastes
of
malt
caramel
coffee
bourbon
a
great
and
powerful
combination
of
flavors
too
bad
the
carbonation
is
barely
present
there
is
a
hint
of
head
around
the
edge
and
on
the
glass
when
i
tilt
it
so
there
is
a
little
bit
but
not
much
a
major
flaw
in
a
great
beer
took
me
75
minutes
to
get
through
this
one
just
because
its
such
a
heavy
flavor
and
heavy
alcohol
and
flat
i
was
pretty
tipsy
when
i
was
done
and
my
wife
was
under
the
table
we
had
a
good
time
drinking
this
though
and
thats
what
was
important
some
bubbles
and
this
would
be
a
great
one
too
bad
the
bubbly
guys
are
missing
smelling
and
savoring
this
beer
is
an
absolute
treat
deep
luxurious
and
delicious
all
come
to
mind
when
i
think
of
describing
this
beer
one
of
my
favorites
of
2009
i
cant
imagine
this
beer
gets
any
better
with
age
luckily
i
have
a
few
more
bottles
to
find
out
good
flavor
too
its
a
damn
shame
this
beer
isnt
carbonated
liquefied
caramel
and
malted
tootsie
rolls
dazzle
the
tongue
while
fig
raisin
adding
some
fructose
sweetness
a
drying
chocolate
liquor
note
finishes
with
a
hint
of
nail
polish
and
breathy
raw
ethanol
body
is
chewy
viscous
and
flat
with
some
spicy
tang
to
the
finish
due
to
the
alcohol
heat
warms
the
stomach
after
only
a
few
ounces
overall
this
was
a
good
beer
its
just
too
bad
that
it
wasnt
properly
carbonated
or
else
it
would
have
been
truly
great
this
was
very
good
although
it
needs
more
time
to
mellow
and
allow
the
flavors
to
blend
together
there
was
far
too
much
bourbon
in
this
that
it
took
away
from
everything
else
i
can
imagine
another
year
this
would
be
amazing
pours
a
very
dark
ruby
near
black
with
a
medium
sized
off
white
head
aroma
was
strong
bourbon
and
vanilla
flavor
was
vanilla
oak
bourbon
candi
sugar
and
caramel
a
bit
over
carbonated
slight
hint
of
the
abv
but
not
bad
this
would
have
been
much
better
without
the
explosive
carbonation
but
still
a
pretty
solid
beer
almost
flat
i
will
remember
to
make
sure
to
split
this
bottle
at
least
4
ways
more
than
a
small
glass
is
overwhelming
2009
bottle
pours
dark
brown
to
black
with
a
head
that
dissipates
quickly
bourbon
and
sweet
burnt
caramel
aromas
linger
in
the
room
some
fig
maple
and
oak
in
there
as
well
mouthfeel
is
silkysyrupy
very
very
light
carbonation
but
not
entirely
flat
like
the
brandy
the
alcohol
is
a
little
more
noticable
than
i
like
but
still
enjoyable
flavors
are
like
the
aroma
with
a
pronounced
bourbon
whisky
flavor
why
cant
they
just
get
some
more
carbonation
in
here
and
it
would
be
a
phenominal
brew
drinkability
low
overall
but
for
a
12
what
do
you
expect
its
all
of
that
and
more
if
you
can
agitate
and
roll
the
2008s
for
a
few
days
to
try
and
get
some
carbonation
in
there
it
probably
would
help
the
overall
appearance
and
maybe
even
the
taste
all
i
know
is
that
this
beer
is
a
monster
and
a
hell
of
an
animal
to
conquer
d
i
like
the
beer
itself
but
am
a
bit
let
down
overall
i
enjoy
a
big
bourbon
filled
beer
which
this
certainly
delivers
on
but
i
thought
the
carbonation
issue
was
fixed
with
this
release
maybe
i
got
a
bum
bottle
which
i
hope
it
was
but
i
expected
a
bit
more
out
of
this
beer
and
it
didnt
deliver
like
i
thought
it
would
d
very
smooth
for
the
style
and
barrel
aging
easy
to
drink
alcohol
is
smooth
and
subtle
very
smooth
lost
abby
hits
a
hr
on
this
one
very
good
drinkability
too
high
for
something
that
clocks
in
at
12
abv
the
taste
is
amazing
the
body
is
warm
and
smooth
the
smell
is
super
enticing
and
matches
the
flavors
perfectly
quite
possibly
one
of
the
best
beers
ever
drinkability
way
higher
than
it
should
be
drinks
so
surprisingly
smoothly
with
great
balance
of
flavors
definitely
worth
it
and
lives
up
to
the
hype
drinkability
its
still
a
strong
brew
at
12abv
and
there
is
nothing
one
can
do
about
that
but
like
the
2009
it
is
just
as
good
a
sipper
no
change
again
well
concealed
so
incredibly
drinkable
for
the
style
but
to
drink
too
quickly
would
probably
rob
you
of
enjoying
all
that
is
going
on
in
this
beer
i
see
now
why
this
beer
is
worthy
of
such
lofty
praise
this
is
on
the
short
list
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
medium
frothy
lasting
beige
head
and
lacing
aroma
is
fruity
sweet
with
heavy
amounts
of
caramel
malt
rasin
plum
licorice
bourbon
oak
and
light
chocolate
flavor
is
sweet
with
a
nice
medley
of
vanilla
chocolate
caramel
and
infused
wood
full
bodied
somewhat
oily
texture
very
little
carbonation
finishes
mildly
alcoholic
i
curve
this
one
high
and
will
seek
out
some
more
the
angels
share
bourbon
barrel
is
yet
one
more
amazing
ale
in
a
long
line
of
amazing
ales
from
the
lost
abbey
heres
hoping
that
tomme
gets
the
kinks
worked
out
and
is
able
to
ensure
that
all
future
releases
are
properly
bubbled
like
this
one
even
though
my
glass
is
now
sadly
empty
this
was
a
hell
of
a
ride
that
i
cant
wait
to
take
again
popped
it
open
little
carbonation
and
hardly
any
bubbles
or
head
on
the
pur
looked
sad
poured
a
deep
amber
color
with
reddish
and
brown
hues
to
it
nose
was
flatter
than
i
expected
due
to
carbonation
i
am
sure
but
the
bourbon
was
there
for
sure
as
was
brown
sugar
candied
fruits
caramel
vanilla
oak
taste
was
strong
on
bourbon
and
despite
crappy
carbonation
it
still
tasted
good
mouthfeel
was
not
has
creamy
and
good
but
nevertheless
it
was
still
tasty
overall
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
but
again
you
cant
drink
too
much
in
a
single
sitting
this
probably
will
age
very
well
also
cheers
a
very
big
and
complex
brew
flavor
is
pleasantly
unified
and
interesting
enough
to
find
something
new
with
each
sip
bourbon
comes
on
strong
but
doesnt
overpower
the
massive
caramel
and
dark
fruit
sweetness
certainly
a
must
try
a
very
nice
sipper
of
a
strong
ale
something
i
would
drink
plenty
of
if
the
price
wasnt
quite
so
high
and
availability
was
a
little
greater
still
it
will
be
a
very
nice
treat
from
time
to
time
d
this
beer
is
dangerous
i
mean
dangerous
it
is
so
drinkable
and
i
could
get
enough
of
it
the
abv
is
very
hidden
and
i
was
sad
once
i
took
my
last
sip
i
wish
i
could
get
my
hands
on
more
of
this
this
one
is
the
750ml
corked
and
caged
pours
a
deep
mahogany
color
with
a
full
finger
wispy
light
tan
head
that
fades
quickly
to
surface
thin
but
significant
patterns
of
belgian
lacing
as
you
go
the
smell
is
amazing
right
out
of
the
bottle
the
first
pour
reveals
big
bourbon
notes
as
it
warms
the
aroma
becomes
fruitier
and
sweeter
brown
sugar
from
a
far
with
a
berry
tartness
further
in
the
mouth
feel
is
bright
and
tangy
mediumlight
bodied
tart
with
a
balanced
creamy
texture
the
flavor
is
crazy
unique
tart
apple
and
berries
bourbon
and
vanilla
with
fig
and
notes
of
molasses
the
experience
lingers
nicely
one
of
the
best
drinkers
around
it
goes
in
a
flash
while
you
attempt
to
consider
all
of
its
complexities
underneath
is
a
somewhat
musty
flavor
like
its
been
aged
but
this
is
a
2008
bottle
very
intriguing
and
complex
notes
although
a
little
bit
off
not
overly
inviting
or
easy
to
drink
but
a
lot
of
fun
and
definitely
off
the
beaten
path
i
expect
nothing
less
from
the
lost
abbey
blipped
angel
by
massive
attack
overall
really
im
not
as
pissed
off
at
this
beer
as
previous
reports
might
indicate
they
released
it
very
green
to
be
sure
but
its
kinda
interesting
to
taste
such
a
great
beer
in
such
an
infantile
stage
the
predominant
thought
i
had
while
drinking
this
is
wow
once
this
grows
up
a
little
bit
it
will
literally
be
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
i
think
that
says
something
overall
i
think
this
comes
really
close
to
living
up
to
the
hype
its
one
of
those
strange
overcomplex
brews
that
im
really
enjoying
think
is
really
good
but
im
not
sure
i
ever
need
another
one
but
a
very
good
beer
so
much
going
on
her
big
bourbon
smell
brown
sugar
vanilla
figs
smokey
rasins
and
a
small
amount
of
funk
the
taste
is
increadable
so
complex
everything
from
rasins
soaked
in
bourbon
oak
vanilla
beans
maple
syrup
dark
fruit
and
wet
hay
the
alcohol
is
very
well
balanced
with
the
rest
of
the
components
of
this
beer
slick
mouthfeel
super
smooth
very
drinkable
but
it
sneaks
up
on
you
finally
made
the
leap
on
this
open
window
windy
evening
during
the
seasonal
transition
good
cheese
pairing
with
meadow
creek
appalachian
tomme
that
my
cheese
shares
its
name
with
the
brewer

not
planned

in
exchange
for
a
375
ml
some
time
ago
via
miscusi
playing
middleman
for
a
ba
outsider
drinkability
i
really
wanted
to
like
this
beer
and
im
quiet
surprised
i
didnt
the
sweetness
was
just
too
overpowering
maybe
i
can
get
another
bottle
and
age
it
for
a
while
and
see
how
that
goes
overall
this
is
a
spectacular
beer
it
is
complex
and
has
all
the
necessary
flavors
definitely
lived
up
to
the
hype
taste
is
right
up
there
similar
to
all
hints
in
the
nose
add
a
twist
of
rum
some
dark
fruits
a
medium
full
body
starting
tickling
with
carbonation
drying
into
the
finish
and
a
bit
slick
an
exceptional
beer
maybe
a
bit
too
carbonated
for
my
taste
but
a
joy
to
drink
2007
375
ml
bottle
poured
into
a
snifter
after
chilling
for
a
couple
weeks
in
the
fridge
i
decided
to
finally
warm
this
puppy
up
and
drink
it
carefully
i
pried
open
the
cork
and
made
sure
it
did
not
completely
fizz
over
an
extermely
careful
pour
produced
a
murky
dark
brown
black
beer
with
a
1
cola
like
tan
head
that
would
not
quit
waited
on
it
for
about
5
minutes
and
no
let
up
huge
aroma
tons
of
sweet
bourbon
some
chocolate
oak
very
inviting
smell
taste
was
not
far
off
from
the
smell
but
i
was
surprised
how
well
balanced
it
was
the
first
sip
was
a
bit
hot
with
the
bourbon
but
it
mellows
quickly
and
nicely
molasses
oak
some
vanilla
and
a
bit
of
booze
all
work
well
together
this
is
a
true
sipper
though
it
warms
the
whole
way
down
and
the
aftertaste
works
overtime
good
carbonation
in
the
mouthfeel
department
but
this
one
stays
heavy
full
bodied
great
night
cap
drinkability
well
this
ones
really
good
damn
good
i
had
the
great
lakes
barrel
aged
blackout
stout
the
other
night
and
though
similar
the
contrast
mainly
lies
in
the
fruits
the
base
beer
here
the
angels
share
i
spose
is
far
fruitier
across
the
board
both
in
the
light
and
dark
fruit
department
different
in
neither
a
good
way
nor
a
bad
way
this
beer
is
naturally
world
class
absolutely
delicious
aromatic
creamy
and
light
and
only
lacking
in
those
areas
where
a
beer
of
this
abv
is
almost
certain
to
lack
lacing
head
retention
pure
drinkablity
id
love
to
have
one
of
these
to
cellar
though
i
do
fear
lost
abbeys
quality
control
issues
highly
recommended
theres
been
some
serious
chatter
about
this
brewery
and
some
of
the
rumors
are
disturbing
but
i
can
only
review
what
comes
from
the
bottles
ive
had
and
ive
never
had
a
bad
bottle
actually
ive
never
had
anything
less
than
an
exceptional
bottle
note
this
review
is
not
based
on
one
single
bad
bottle
and
is
not
a
slam
against
said
brewery
more
a
mounting
disappointment
with
both
this
overpriced
in
my
opinion
beer
and
talented
brewery
that
is
losing
a
loyal
fan
base
because
of
price
gouging
the
cork
came
out
easy
and
was
followed
by
a
bit
of
foaming
nothing
too
extreme
but
opening
it
near
my
sink
was
a
good
idea
the
beer
is
dark
and
opaque
sort
of
a
toffee
brown
a
little
murky
and
it
has
a
rocky
brownish
beige
head
not
much
head
retention
with
a
little
chunky
lace
not
bad
for
a
big
beer
nice
aroma
rich
toffee
and
dried
fruits
dates
and
prunes
bready
and
sweet
with
a
combination
of
caramel
and
bourbon
mild
oak
and
vanilla
with
a
bit
of
molasses
crap
theres
a
lot
of
carbonation
too
much
it
gets
in
the
way
of
tasting
the
beer
alcohol
warmth
and
flavour
throughout
lingering
into
the
finish
bitterness
was
moderate
to
low
noticeable
without
being
up
front
malts
were
quite
nice
though
very
bready
with
a
lot
of
caramelized
sugar
character
toffee
and
a
hint
of
chocolate
pleasant
woody
and
vanilla
bourbon
notes
and
plenty
of
dried
fruits
raisins
slight
astringency
from
the
wood
medium
to
full
bodied
pretty
good
very
tasty
the
only
real
problem
is
the
overcarbonation
which
really
detracted
from
the
experience
d
just
a
really
great
beer
very
complex
a
nice
mix
of
the
barrel
and
a
great
base
beer
recommended
d
why
did
lost
abbey
go
from
750s
to
375s
those
cheap
bastards
on
tap
at
the
arizona
strong
beer
festival
color
was
a
rudy
dark
brown
color
lots
of
head
and
the
keg
poured
very
foamy
when
it
was
first
tapped
but
settled
down
later
on
had
a
big
white
head
aroma
of
oak
barrels
and
toffee
with
a
slightly
high
alcohol
awareness
evident
taste
was
of
a
woody
oak
barrel
sweet
malt
beer
very
excellent
beer
and
one
of
my
favorites
at
the
festival
the
rep
said
some
bottles
would
be
coming
to
arizona
soon
a
great
beer
one
of
the
more
exciting
ones
ive
tried
in
a
while
drinkability
a
superb
sipper
not
sure
id
spring
for
these
too
often
even
if
they
were
more
easily
attained
but
im
certainly
thankful
to
south
bay
for
this
one
great
thanks
to
jwale73
for
sharing
is
absurdly
great
beer
pours
black
with
a
minimal
head
nose
is
absurd
maybe
the
best
ive
ever
o
smelled
it
for
about
10
minutes
vanilla
caramel
toffee
oak
bourbon
and
dark
fruits
taste
is
excellent
as
well
incredibly
rich
and
complex
with
maple
toffee
bourbon
vanilla
and
raisins
dancing
in
a
thick
rich
goodness
finish
has
some
alcohol
but
nicley
balanced
by
a
little
sweet
and
a
little
bitter
just
a
wonderful
beer
this
is
a
sipper
to
be
sure
but
is
quite
enjoyable
it
will
be
a
pleasure
to
enjoy
the
375mls
even
though
it
will
take
me
a
while
to
do
so
definitely
worth
trying
for
fans
of
well
crafted
barrel
aged
brews
guess
i
will
have
to
try
to
acquire
the
brandy
barrel
version
in
order
to
compare
it
with
this
rich
and
tasty
treat
highly
recommended
d
so
drinkable
the
beer
is
one
of
the
best
i
have
had
and
i
am
lucky
to
have
had
it
im
glad
i
asked
what
the
unmarked
lost
abbey
tap
was
because
the
bar
that
shall
go
nameless
was
not
advertising
they
had
it
this
is
a
great
beer
its
big
and
opponents
of
oakaged
beers
probably
wont
like
it
but
still
its
delicious
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
the
high
abv
12
is
there
and
you
know
its
there
but
its
not
tyrannical
it
settles
back
and
lets
the
laidback
fruit
flavors
take
over
in
a
velvety
tongue
a
great
brew
at
every
step
worth
seeking
out
if
you
cant
find
it
in
your
neck
of
the
woods
pours
a
deep
black
with
a
one
finger
fluffy
light
tan
colored
head
that
falls
to
a
thin
layer
bits
of
stickiness
grab
a
hold
of
the
sides
here
and
there
but
not
a
whole
lot
aroma
is
thick
with
bourbon
vanilla
and
rich
caramel
malts
a
good
dose
of
molasses
with
plums
dates
and
raisins
a
very
complex
nose
which
im
sure
will
carry
over
to
the
flavor
or
at
least
i
hope
initial
flavor
is
sweet
vermont
maple
syrup
with
caramel
and
chocolate
bourbon
oak
midway
with
brown
sugar
almonds
and
fig
smokey
and
sweet
aftertaste
with
toffee
butterscotch
and
toasted
malts
very
full
flavored
ale
with
a
lot
to
take
in
the
feel
is
a
medium
warm
body
with
a
very
aggressive
carbonation
that
really
distracts
from
the
overall
quality
of
this
beer
unfortunately
a
great
sipping
beer
i
just
wish
it
was
smoother
in
the
mouth
reminiscent
in
body
to
magic
hats
feast
of
fools
sixpoints
bolshoi
light
to

highly
carbonated

yeast
like

very
drinkable
despite
the
big
flavors
and
the

content
of
this
brew
its
a
sipper
though
angels

in
my
opinion
lives
up
to
the
all
the
hype
that
ive
heard
another
great
beer
from
the

dark

but
i
think
i
was
wrong
another
big
thanks
to
heath
for
this
brew
ive
been
a
little
underwhelmed
with
lost
abbey
and
especially
their
pricing
but
this
beer
is
a
good
one
angels
share
is
very
interesting
and
the
bourbon
barrel
aging
adds
another
layer
of
depth
id
like
to
try
the
brandy
version
to
compare
overall
a
very
very
very
good
beer
but
im
not
sure
if
it
is
a
holy
grail
type
of
beer
complex
flavors
and
smell
accompanied
by
a
nice
amount
of
bourbon
aging
that
wasnt
too
overwhelming
a
try
it
beer
for
sure
cheers
pours
opaque
ruby
brown
with
a
ring
of
bubbles
nose
is
heavily
bourbon
some
brief
hints
of
raisins
vanilla
and
oak
fortunately
the
taste
rounds
out
the
bourbon
with
stronger
vanilla
oak
chocolate
and
cocoa
powder
pleasant
alcoholic
warmth
sadly
and
probably
because
of
the
buildup
to
finally
having
this
beer
it
left
me
wanting
more
not
complaining
this
was
excellent
but
i
still
wanted
more
i
am
very
impressed
with
this
beer
as
a
whole
most
of
the
regular
lost
abbey
brews
ive
been
unimpressed
with
and
with
all
the
hyped
up
beers
ive
tasted
recently
this
is
one
of
a
few
that
i
feel
lives
up
to
its
hype
dark
brown
with
a
nice
creamy
head
as
expected
the
barrel
is
up
front
then
you
start
to
smell
the
other
aspects
a
surprise
in
the
aroma
is
a
hint
of
cherry
strong
bourbon
flavor
toffee
and
vanilla
start
drinking
at
cellar
temp
and
allow
the
beer
to
warm
this
is
an
amazing
beer
near
perfection
in
a
barrel
aged
beer
the
first
lost
abbey
brew
ive
had
thats
met
the
hype
overall
well
worth
the
hype
in
fact
this
beer
exceeded
my
expectations
thanks
again
drseamus
and
eclectic
for
this
awesome
brew
cork
popped
with
much
force
plenty
of
carbonation
and
the
beer
started
storming
up
the
neck
of
the
bottle
pours
a
very
dark
brown
in
color
some
nice
bourbon
oak
and
toffee
notes
in
the
nose
taste
is
more
of
the
bourbon
but
you
get
the
other
flavors
from
the
barrel
as
well
some
nice
oak
and
vanilla
help
out
very
carbonated
and
bubbly
on
the
mouthfeel
would
have
liked
it
to
be
a
bit
smoother
i
preferred
this
one
to
the
brandy
version
this
seems
to
be
much
more
balanced
and
the
flavors
seem
to
compliment
each
other
and
work
well
d
goes
down
very
easy
in
spite
of
the
high
abv
and
bourbon
barrel
aging
decadent
yet
under
control
complex
yet
approachable
this
beer
is
very
deserving
of
its
elite
status
one
of
my
alltime
favorites
pours
a
deep
amber
to
a
black
color
with
a
big
yeasty
tan
head
in
the
aroma
oak
vanilla
roasty
malt
bourbon
and
just
a
hint
of
chocolate
in
the
taste
bourbon
vanilla
oaky
with
hints
of
chocolate
and
alcohol
a
smooth
and
big
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
bourbon
and
alcohol
aftertaste
a
great
sipper
and
perfect
to
share
great
flavors
and
all
around
pretty
freakin
great
one
of
the
best
barrelaged
beers
ive
had
in
a
loooong
time
if
you
can
get
hold
of
this
baby
try
it
really
amazing
beer
grows
more
and
more
complex
as
it
warms
up
very
easy
drinking
seek
this
one
out
sweet
smooth
incredible
pours
a
slightly
hazy
dark
brown
with
faint
ruby
highlights
when
held
to
light
lots
of
carbonation
produced
a
huge
fluffy
off
white
head
that
impaled
itself
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
smells
of
bourbon
licorice
toffee
some
higher
alcohols
and
maybe
a
faint
brett
type
smell
tastes
of
sweet
malt
some
plums
some
alcohol
some
bourbon
carbonation
is
a
bit
high
and
affects
the
mouthfeel
a
bit
feels
prickly
with
carbonation
as
well
as
a
bit
syrupy
heavy
thick
body
good
brew
i
wish
the
carbonation
was
a
bit
lower
but
overall
solid
brew
at
15
dollars
plus
shipping
for
a
little
more
than
12
ounces
i
can
safely
say
that
i
probably
wont
seek
this
one
out
again
damn
good
stuff
for
sure
and
glad
i
got
to
try
it
so
i
know
for
certain
this
is
wildly
overpriced
and
not
something
i
would
purchase
on
its
own
not
nearly
as
complex
as
i
would
have
expected
came
across
as
less
intersting
than
other
barrel
aged
ales
ive
encountered
such
as
firestone
11
and
a
handful
of
others
sampled
at
the
same
event
good
stuff
again
but
the
wife
and
i
agreed
that
for
something
with
such
hype
and
inflated
pricing
its
a
bit
mundane
poured
a
hazy
red
brown
color
with
a
small
light
tan
head
that
left
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
of
roasted
malts
light
cocoa
vanilla
dried
fruits
caramel
and
a
bit
of
bourbon
as
well
taste
of
more
cocoa
some
roast
raisins
and
other
dark
fruits
some
vanilla
oak
and
a
bit
of
bourbony
alcohol
in
the
finish
i
guess
ill
be
part
of
the
camp
who
prefers
the
brandy
version
to
this
one
but
big
thanks
to
eda
for
sharing
this
a
fantastic
brew
cant
wait
to
try
the
brandy
version
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
has
somewhat
of
a
creaminess
to
it
as
well
this
is
quite
carbonated
and
personally
i
think
the
carbonation
is
a
little
overdone
here
overall
though
its
intensely
complex
warming
and
contemplative
definitely
a
sipper
but
one
i
could
sip
all
night
an
amazing
beer
that
i
would
recommend
any
day
of
the
week
notes
from
and
tasted
on
41408
note
the
2009
version
has
no
carbonation
and
is
very
boozy
a
real
disappointment

very
dark

intense
and
lovely
aroma
of

winey
notes
the
mouthfeel
has
lots
of
alcoholic
warmth
as
expected
the
flavour
has
notes
of
oak
and
fortified
wine
very
good
the
only
drags
to
this
beer
was
the
near
explosion
at
the
end
and
the
black
schmootz
i
found
at
the
bottom
of
the
glass
i
dont
know
what
the
fuck
that
was
but
i
didnt
drink
it
luckily
i
have
one
more
bottle
of
this
years
batch
hopefully
itll
mellow
out
and
there
will
be
no
accidents
thanks

for
the
ways
the

bring
them

the

ive
waited
a
long
time
to
try
this
one
out
finally
the
wait
is
over
thanks
mike
tough
to
pick
up
on
the
12
alc
2008
bottle
at
obriens
sd
a
while
back
interesting
mix
of
sour
and
burbon
dark
rich
ale
flavor
malt
sweet
oak
burbon
flavor
that
provides
a
complex
and
long
finish
that
i
have
not
experienced
before
still
young
and
i
feel
it
can
age
for
several
years
lots
of
yeast
in
this
one
but
dont
pour
it
out
the
last
small
glass
cloudy
and
chunky
was
outstanding
this
is
another
perfectly
crafted
work
of
art
from
the
lost
abbey
its
just
one
of
those
beers
that
is
so
rich
complex
and
well
balanced
that
its
easy
to
get
lost
in
its
awesomeness
and
then
because
of
its
fantastic
quaffability
not
realize
that
its
all
gone
until
your
licking
the
last
drop
out
of
the
glass
extremely
well
done
i
loved
every
drop
overall
bourbon
snobs
or
geeks
will
love
this
beer
its
balanced
flavorful
and
possesses
lots
of
great
bourbon
notes
such
a
great
beer
one
that
every
bourbon
snobgeek
should
seek
out
there
is
lots
of
bourbon
in
the
smell
along
with
other
fruits
and
spice
raisins
are
especially
pronounced
these
same
traits
are
also
present
in
the
taste
along
with
vanilla
carmel
and
tons
of
sweetness
definitely
my
kind
of
beer
its
a
shame
this
is
one
of
those
crazy
rare
beers
thats
so
hard
to
come
by
id
drink
this
all
the
time
if
i
could
one
of
my
favorites
d
i
wouldnt
drink
strong
ales
all
the
time
but
this
specific
one
i
could
drink
any
time
its
so
flavorful
and
an
amazing
experience
cant
complain
i
recommend
this
to
anyone
its
more
of
a
sit
at
home
and
drink
beer
than
a
bar
beer
if
that
makes
sense
grab
a
book
have
some
cheese
or
chocolate
nearby
sit
in
a
comfy
chair
and
relax
type
beer
had
this
brew
after
dinner
this
evening
and
it
is
a
treat
for
any
beer
lover
very
glad
to
have
the
opportunity
to
try
this
one
thanks
to
aaron
and
jason
for
the
chance
to
try
this
d
reminds
me
slightly
of
a
highly
carbonated
bourbon
county
stout
somewhat
one
dimensional
on
the
bourbon
side
but
that
is
not
a
bad
thing
coming
from
this
bourbon
fan
md
fullbodied
devilishly
smooth
with
superfine
carbonation
and
a
tad
oily
on
the
palate
this
oakaged
dark
barley
wine
is
great
as
a
nightcap
satisfying
in
a
spiritlifting
way
better
served
in
a
sniffer
i
say
poured
into
a
corsendonk
tulip
a
nice
dark
brown
with
a
huge
frothy
head
aroma
is
a
nice
blend
of
bourbon
and
brown
malts
the
taste
is
absolutely
unworldly
toasted
brown
malt
burnt
caramel
bourbon
and
dried
fruits
provide
an
indescribable
complexity
the
beer
is
on
the
heavy
side
of
medium
with
moderately
present
alcohol
and
slight
carbonation
certainly
a
sipper
this
beer
is
simply
wonderful
one
of
the
best
ive
ever
had
overall
very
very
good

drinkability

this
is

the

is
hiddeen
very
well
the
taste
is
very
complex
and
smooth
at
12
it
goes
down
very
easy
but
you
will
want
to
savor
and
sip
this
beer
i
just
cant
say
enough
about
how
good
this
beer
is
awesome
achievement
here
wish
it
wasnt
as
carbonated
as
it
was
still
quite
enjoyable
something
that
should
definately
be
seeked
out

dont
overpower

doesnt

matter
feel

to
it
liquid
is
smooth
very
easy
to
drink
a
bit
of
a
sipper
but
i
force
myself
to
do
that
to
savor
the
moment
drinkability
is
somewhat
average
due
to
gusher
and
high
alcohol
but
since
it
is
so
dang
smooth
i
want
another
my
bottle
went
way
to
quick
and
will
be
seeking
out
more
d
amazingly
complex
but
alcohol
is
too
harsh
for
my
liking
thus
i
wont
go
out
of
my
way
to
search
for
it
but
a
do
recommend
trying
it
again
the
complexity
is
great
i
remember
the
brandy
version
being
a
bit
smoother
and
more
easy
to
drink
so
easy
that
the
12
5
sneaked
up
on
me
and
that
one
was
750ml
too
this
one
is
still
pretty
drinkable
but
it
could
be
better

scott
drinkability
is
pretty
good
but
could
be
better
the
alcohol
warmth
and
high
carbonation
really
take
away
from
it
overall
it
gets
better
once
its
had
some
time
for
the
carbonation
to
dissipate
to
me
this
one
just
doesnt
quite
have
the
depth
and
fullness
that
the
original

had
d
i
got
this
jewel
as
an
extra
from
rallison

thanks
ryan
i
am
thrilled
to
have
had
the
chance
to
try
this
spectacular
offering
had
a
little
burnt
brown
shards
in
the
bottom

this
was
extemly
drinkable

surrounding
it

sugary
body
that
is
cut
well
by
a
good

as
well
as
an
active
and
somewhat
peppery
and
crisp
carbonation
absolutely
delicious
how
will
i
keep
my
hands
off
of
whats
left
in
the
cellar
the
barrel
ageing
works
very
well
with
this
beer
extremely
well
done
im
a
big
fan
of
bourbon
aged
beers
oak
aged
beers
and
those
beers
that
just
seem
to
bring
a
little
something
extra
to
the
table
this
beer
totally
runs
the
gauntlet
popping
the
cork
on
this
bad
boy
and
pouring
it
i
knew
i
was
in
for
something
special
then
you
put
it
to
your
nose
all
i
could
say
was
wow
if
this
taste
as
good
as
it
smells
sweet
oak
aged
vanilla
bourbon
belgian
candi
sugar
then
the
taste
smooth
beyond
all
belief
alcohol
was
very
well
hidden
basically
because
my
palette
was
busy
moshing
over
all
the
flavors
of
vanilla
oak
and
bourbon
and
sugars
that
were
to
be
what
i
expected
from
the
nose
it
did
not
let
up
holy
moses
sweet
fathers
of
the
brewing
gods
i
have
seen
the
light
and
it
beem
through
a
bottle
of
bourbon
barrel
aged
lost
abbey
angels
share
drinkability
for
me
it
was
more
than
a
bit
overcarbonated
but
thankfully
it
delivered
a
satisfying
tastiness
to
warrant
fighting
the
fizzies
d
its
a
great
well
put
together
complex
beer
but
it
almost
seems
futile
to
rate
the
drinkability
of
such
a
rare
beer
tastes
oaky
emptiness
over
malt
sweet
and
alcohol
chocolate
powder
like
nestle
cocoa
bourbon
and
mild
fruitiness
nice
but
not
overly
complex
the
alcohol
and
sweet
conflict
in
comparable
intensity

body
and
oaky
dries
out
the
finish
decent
drinkablility
drinking
my
last
bottle
of
this
batch
2008
and
i
have
to
say
that
it
hasnt
changed
too
much
still
very
bourbonforward
up
front
with
some
vanilla
and
coconut
working
brilliantly
with
the
tobacco
and
dark
fruit
the
booze
has
died
down
a
touch
but
good
god
this
is
a
brilliant
beer
bravo
tomme
d
while
it
is
certainly
not
a
session
ale
its
a
fantastic
brew
overall
wish
it
was
brewed
more
frequently
and
easier
to
get
but
im
just
happy
i
got
to
try
it
once
big
thanks
to
intriqken
for
the
bottle
unfortunately
this
is
way
to
carbonated
really
hurting
the
mouthfeel
as
it
causes
the
beer
to
seperate
on
the
toungue
on
each
sip
almost
discentigrating
in
nature
however
i
can
live
with
that
and
could
drink
this
all
day
overall
delicious
and
fun
and
interesting
but
worthy
of
the
astonishing
hype
im
extremely
happy
to
have
had
it
and
id
even
stand
in
line
for
it
if
i
was
local
but
a
average
i
think
its
somewhat
overhyped
its
not
a
true
5
in
any
category
again
dont
get
me
wrong
its
delicious
really
really
tasty
but
mindblowing
a
it
is
not
an
extremely
drinkable
and
smooth
big
beer
but
abv
is
still
too
high
for
a
great
score
06
bourbon
was
on
tap
for
the
toronado
bw
fest
and
blew
most
everything
else
away
the
other
3
ive
had
side
by
side
a
couple
of
times
and
the
ranking
seems
to
stay
the
same
so
yeah
a
4
5
average
for
this
i
think
is
about
fair
the
06
bourbon
would
score
near
a
5
the
06
brandy
probably
a
4
7
or
so
and
the
07
brandy
probably
a
4
34
4
or
so
all
fine
beers
though
no
question
notes
i
drank
one
of
these
a
month
ago
but
was
too
buzzed
to
even
taste
it
one
of
those
nights
yknow
my
friend
and
even
my
girlfriend
said
it
was
good
tho
so
i
figured
id
rock
one
for
my
100th
decanted
from
the
bottle
into
a
snifter
pours
a
dark
color
with
a
massive
head
the
head
subsides
quite
a
bit
leaving
a
thin
layer
of
foam
across
the
top
aroma
is
intense
big
notes
of
vanilla
bourbon
plums
caramel
and
alcohol
taste
starts
with
bourbon
and
vanilla
then
transitions
to
caramel
malts
and
plums
finally
ending
with
a
mild
coffeelike
bitterness
damn
theres
a
lot
going
on
mouthfeel
is
right
in
the
middle
and
quite
creamy
this
is
a
big
beer
and
definitely
a
sipper
overall
i
have
zero
criticism
for
this
beer
it
is
excellent
in
general
a
superb
strong
ale
that
exhibits
a
wonderful
spirit
barrel
character
a
great
beer
to
enjoy
over
an
hours
time
as
it
warms
more
complexity
shines
through
pours
black
with
some
faint
brown
showing
up
around
the
edges
when
held
up
to
the
light
great
tight
head
that
sticks
around
as
a
somewhat
thick
cap
especially
impressive
given
the
huge
abv
the
aromas
are
heavenly
just
the
right
amount
of
bourbon
right
off
the
bat
lovely
aromas
of
caramel
gentle
but
pure
bourbon
sweet
oak
vanilla
gentle
malt
chestnut
honey
and
various
dark
fruit
all
nicely
integrated
and
not
hot
smelling
the
taste
is
also
amazing
extremely
well
integrated
flavors
with
great
bourbon
and
oak
up
front
followed
by
cream
vanilla
and
fruit
flavors
very
nice
level
of
carbonation
not
too
aggressive
at
all
the
mouthfeel
is
ultra
rich
and
creamy
but
with
the
alcohol
well
hidden
an
absolutely
amazing
sipper
i
really
like
bourbon
influenced
oak
aged
beers
if
they
are
done
well
i
think
this
is
probably
my
favorite
to
date
when
this
brewery
is
firing
on
all
cylinders
they
can
really
be
fantastic
this
beer
sure
is
not
nearly
as
good
as
the
regular
angels
share
in
my
opinion
pours
a
dark
cola
color
with
light
tan
colored
super
fizzy
head
bottle
gushed
upon
opening
too
smell
is
vanilla
raisin
bourbon
and
sweet
malt
taste
is
similar
but
much
more
mild
than
the
standard
angels
share
which
was
really
rich
and
strongly
flavored
the
carbonation
was
way
too
high
in
this
body
and
it
just
foamed
in
the
mouth
which
drives
me
nuts
overcarbonated
and
underflavored
brown
color
with
a
full
head
hard
to
get
much
out
of
the
nose
at
all
velvety
mouth
feel
with
a
smooth
texture
not
very
complex
overall
with
out
nuance
or
depth
it
does
have
a
nice
hint
of
dried
chocolate
on
the
finish
but
other
than
that
there
isnt
a
lot
of
describable
character
good
solid
ale
i
have
found
these
new
versions
of
angels
share
beers
to
be
just
ok
both
the
latest
batches
are
not
as
good
as
the
original
batch
at
gabf
2006
the
tap
version
to
me
tasted
a
little
more
viscus
and
fruity
wick
i
liked
but
both
are
amazing
glad
my
dad
recently
have
me
a
few
more
of
his
bottles
so
i
can
enjoy
this
a
little
more
since
i
traded
off
half
of
mine
cant
wait
untill
the
next
release
thanks
lost

edit
review
comparison
unlike
the
bourbon
barrel
the
brandy
heats
up
a
lot
stronger
even
with
more
age
on
it
not
as
smokey
and
woody
character
to
it
instead
you
have
upfront
brandy
which
hits
your
tongue
very
noticeable
leaves
a
bigger
bitterness
as
well
imo
think
i
prefer
the
bourbon
barrel
just
due
to
the
more
complex
wood
characters
that
come
through
along
with
the
smokiness
i
thought
that
balanced
everything
out
and
made
it
better
rounded
than
the
brandy
does
believe
the
hype
unworthy
of
its
place
as
one
of
the
most
perfect
beers
in
the
world
but
conversely
very
worthy
of
the
hype
as
something
interesting
and
spectacular
in
its
own
roughly
honed
way
d
this
is
my
first
angels
share
and
i
have
to
say
its
one
of
my
desert
island
beers
near
perfect
the
flavors
are
so
big
yet
so
well
balanced
the
hype
is
completely
deserved
i
need
more
of
this
now
i
had
high
expectations
for
this
one
and
theyve
actually
been
exceeded
its
hard
to
find
any
fault
in
this
beer
my
one
small
criticism
is
that
it
needs
to
be
a
tad
thicker
and
have
the
feel
smoothed
out
a
little
nevertheless
lost
abbey
has
crafted
a
world
class
beer
with
this
one
you
must
find
it
somehow
someway
this
poured
mahogany
in
color
with
a
creamy
head
the
nose
was
nicely
complex
with
scents
of
roasted
malts
vanilla
chocolate
dark
fruit
and
a
slight
herbalness
the
palate
is
similarly
complex
and
medium
to
fullbodied
with
great
richness
and
balance
there
is
plenty
of
carbonation
to
keep
this
deep
beer
fresh
aging
should
allow
this
to
mellow
out
a
bit
and
be
potentially
perfect
for
my
palate
i
had
heard
a
lot
of
talk
about
this
beer
and
was
finally
lucky
enough
to
try
it
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
at
first
the
pour
is
dark
brown
with
descent
head
it
has
a
lot
of
distinct
flavors
in
the
taste
however
they
are
perfectly
balanced
so
that
no
one
is
too
strong
the
taste
is
very
rich
by
far
the
best
beer
that
i
have
ever
had
although
not
something
that
you
could
drink
more
than
a
couple
of
glasses
of
due
to
the
rich
flavor
if
you
can
locate
a
bottle
of
this
limited
release
i
would
highly
recommend
it
d
very
slow
sipper
its
in
a
12
7oz
bottle
for
a
reason
damn
tasty
and
will
cap
my
night
nicely
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
hot
oaky
with
chewy
sugary
caramel
along
the
palate
d
much
too
hot
for
my
taste
but
a
very
interesting
beer
i
cant
quite
believe
that
this
beer
is
only
12
5
abv
as
it
is
very
boozy
thumbs
up
to
tomme
for
putting
out
another
creative
brew
imagine
how
well
this
is
going
to
age
im
looking
forward
to
trying
this
again
soon
d
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
that
just
bring
so
much
to
the
table
and
yet
it
is
complex
and
completely
in
balance
the
nose
is
nice
and
dominated
by
the
oaky
and
bourbon
spiciness
the
taste
runs
the
gamut
from
sweet
spicy
fruity
i
would
love
to
try
to
get
a
hold
of
some
more
of
this
and
even
try
to
age
some
if
i
could
wait
long
enough
not
to
drink
it
i
think
it
would
be
interesting
to
see
if
the
beer
mellowed
out
in
a
definitely
a
top
tier
beer
and
one
of
the
best
ive
had
also
a
sipper
not
because
it
is
overly
strong
or
out
of
balanced
but
because
each
sip
is
so
complex
that
it
deserves
your
full
attention
and
is
a
beer
that
requires
your
full
attention
did
not
enjoy
this
one
as
much
as
the
brandy
version
but
it
was
still
awesome
would
say
this
version
is
more
similar
to
a
barleywine
the
smaller
size
bottle
was
a
perfect
serving
too
because
of
how
strong
it
is
this
one
was
a
serious
gusher
this
is
one
of
the
most
unique
beers
out
there
and
if
you
have
not
tried
either
of
the
angels
shares
then
you
really
need
to
will
definitely
drink
again
in
the
upcoming
years
congratulations
to
tomme
again
for
brewing
yet
another
masterpiece
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
pretty
tasty
brew
that
i
really
enjoyed
that
being
said
theres
no
way
i
could
ever
drink
more
than
one
the
oak
and
bourbon
teeter
on
the
border
of
being
absolutely
delicious
and
way
over
the
top
either
way
its
good
to
the
last
drop
and
ridiculously
complex
big
thanks
to
tim
and
shane
pours
a
beautiful
deep
brown
color
dark
and
beautiful
the
small
tan
head
quickly
dissipates
slowly
average
lacing
and
surprisingly
above
average
carbonation
usually
barrel
aged
beers
become
flat
not
this
beer
i
appears
o
be

smell
of
strong
bourbon
and
sweet
roasted

tastes
of
strong
bourbonwhiskey
coffee
sweet
roasted
malts
coffee
and

complex
and
very
tasty
this

more
the
price
of
entry
is
sinful
but
the
result
is
decadent
im
glad
i
took
a
leap
of
faith
and
bought
this
one
oh
one
last
sad
note
at
375mls
this
one
is
over
all
too
fast
pours
a
dark
brown
and
ruby
with
a
huge
rocky
light
tan
head
appears
to
be
quite
overcarbonated
nose
reeks
of
bourbon
heat
and
dark
fruits
wood
taste
bourbon
dark

caramel
bourbon
soaked

caramel
apple
wood
and
bourbon
and
alcohol
on
the
finish
wonderful
great
sweetnes
lingers
in
the
mouth
and
on
the
lips
this
one
will
be
amazing
after
a
few
years
in
the
cellar
mouthfeel
is
suprisingly
thin
and
waaayyy
more
carbonated
than
i
expected
drinkability
is
good
for
the
style
but
will
greatly
improve
with
some
cellaring
i
think
certainly
an
amazing
concoction
bourbon
is
right
up
front
defenitely
a
great
cellar
candidate
pleased
to
have
had
the
opportunity
to
have
tried
it
thanks
again
dana
the
cork
flew
out
of
this
375ml
and
then
the
beer
erupted
dark
brown
it
looks
just
like
the
brandy
version
nice
bourbon
and
wood
smell
tastes
like
cola
and
vanilla
coupled
with
bourbon
some
licorice
this
is
a
very
flavorful
beer
and
the
alcohol
was
well
hidden
i
preferred
the
profile
on
the
brandy
barrel
version
a
little
more
but
this
was
still
very
good
joey
you
are
awesome
thanks
for
supplying
the
lucky
few
of
us
that
actually
acquired
a
bottle
i
am
in
your
debt
i
didnt
do
you
the
favor
by
buying
it
you
did
me
the
favor
by
selling
it
d
this
is
so
good
it
pains
me
that
i
cannot
get
this
as
often
as
i
would
like
thank
you
sooo
much
chefscott79
this
is
an
incredibly
complex
beer
calling
it
a
strong
ale
is
almost
insulting
but
i
dont
know
where
else
it
should
go
either
i
sipped
this
over
the
course
of
two
hours
and
enjoyed
every
minute
of
it
somehow
not
nearly
as
well
integrated
nor
nearly
so
tasty
as
the
2006
brandy
version
i
have
yet
to
try
the
2007
i
could
see
this
getting
close
but
somehow
the
base
beer
has
changed
too
much
while
residing
in
the
barrel
i
wonder
if
the
changed
flavor
lightened
body
along
with
the
gushing
is
caused
by
a
slight
infection
if
so
it
is
not
so
much
as
to
drastically
effect
things
or
even
be
overtly
noticeable
but
this
beer
is
just
enough
off
to
keep
it
from
being
great
d
i
really
really
wanted
to
not
like
this
beer
i
tried
to
find
as
much
wrong
with
it
as
i
could
but
i
just
couldnt
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
brewery
didnt
buy
into
the
hype
and
i
loved
it
try
to
get
a
bottle
now
why
there
is
still
some
in
circulation
you
wont
regret
it
what
an
exceptional
beer
im
not
convinced
this
is
a
barleywine
strictly
its
a
bit
heavy
on
the
dark
chocolate
and
crystal
malts
it
pours
a
dark
brown
almost
black
it
also
has
a
significant
chocolate
flavor
on
there
theres
also
tons
of
caramel
and
vanilla
from
the
bourbon
barrel
its
pretty
thick
full
bodied
but
it
goes
down
silky
smooth
this
was
by
far
the
best
beer
at
the
fest
even
though
im
not
sure
it
would
classify
as
a
barleywine
by
bjcp
or
by
gabf
standards
i
guess
thats
why
lost
abbey
classifies
it
as
one
of
their
nondenomination
beers
still
this
is
a
must
have
for
any
beer
fan
what
a
treat
i
could
sit
for
hours
and
just
sniff
that
vanilla
caramel
chocolate
and
oak
lovely
stuff
satisfies
my
bourbonloving
sweet
tooth
tongue
though
it
feels
like
an
imperial
stout
overall
drinkability
how
does
one
rate
a
beer
like
this
for
drinkability
i
will
certainly
have
it
again
i
hope
props
to
tomme
on
perfectly
harnessing
the
power
of
the
bourbon
barrel
although
i
dont
like
this
one
quite
as
much
as
the
brandy
barrel
version
both
are
absolutely
world
class
beers
drinkabilitynotes
sure
am
glad
i
joined
the
la
sinners
club
where
else
could
i
get
such
fantastic
beer
bourbon
barrel
angels
share
hits
a
home
run
im
not
a
big
fan
of
some
bourbon
barrel
aged
beers
but
this
one
is
spot
on
the
bourbon
accents
the
beer
not
dominating
the
flavor
profile
whatsoever
plenty
of
big
rich
dark
fruit
with
hints
of
vanilla
and
bourbon
all
finished
with
a
nice
bit
of
hop
bitterness
alcohol
is
so
well
hidden
its
dangerous
a
true
sipper
that
gets
better
as
it
warms
seek
and
enjoy
highly
recommended
every
sip
makes
me
a
little
more
pissed
that
tomme
arthur
is
on
his
rag
because
of
his
beers
being
sold
on
ebay
and
no
longer
releasing
this
beer
in
750
ml
size
ya
know
selling
smaller
bottles
and
charging
more
isnt
going
to
stop
people
from
ebaying
these
its
just
going
to
upset
the
loyal
fans
and
customers
this
is
my
first
review
so
this
is
a
great
beer
for
the
occasion
poured
into
a
double
bastard
glass
beautiful
appearance
root
beer
brown
with
a
decadent
head
smell
fluttered
with
alcohol
just
for
a
second
then
came
the
carmel
sweetness
and
malty
tang
the
taste
come
on
flirted
with
heavenly
bourbon
flavor
mixed
expertly
with
rich
malt
sugar
carmel
flavor
this
beer
felt
wonderful
on
the
mouth
dangerously
almost
too
good
drinkability
off
the
charts
i
could
drink
this
beer
regularly
if
you
have
the
means
i
highly
suggest
you
getting
this
beer
truly
exceptional
and
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
ever
had
its
difficult
to
write
an
appropriate
description
of
a
transcendental
experience
this
divine
concoction
changed
my
perspective
on
what
beer
could
be
it
offers
every
bit
of
complexity
of
a
great
wine
melded
with
the
deep
satisfaction
of
a
superb
beer
most
barleywines
seem
to
be
overly
sweet
or
harshly
alcoholic
but
the
balance
in
this
beer
is
tremendous
do
whatever
you
can
to
secure
some
of
this
incredible
beer
flavors
of
malt
vanilla
chocolate
with
hints
of
molasses
bourbon
and
toffee
the
tastes
dont
linger
too
long
so
there
is
no
overpowering
buildup
moderate
carbonation
helps
to
cleanse
the
palate
somewhat
hot
much
smoother
than
the
brandy
version
a
fantastic
world
class
beer
i
really
want
to
try
this
headtohead
with
the
last
release
to
see
how
they
compare
i
think
the
bourbon
barrel
version
is
less
subtle
and
complex
but
equally
delicious
the
nuances
i
remember
savoring
with
each
sip
have
been
replaced
and
overwhelmed
by
an
oak
and
bourbon
background
somewhat
disappointing
a
surprisingly
high
level
of
carbonation
which
i
liked
but
might
be
offputting
to
some
d
well
this
is
perhaps
my
most
favorite
beer
ever
i
would
drink
this
daily
if
i
had
the
stores
absolutely
amazing
stuff
definitely
a
bit
of
heaven
overall
i
really
loved
this
one
now
i
have
not
really
had
anything
from
lost
abbey
that
i
have
not
liked
but
this
and
devotion
on
back
to
back
nights
have
really
taken
this
thing
to
a
while
new
level
the
complexity
displayed
in
the
is
uncanny
and
i
really
had
a
touch
time
with
this
review
as
i
am
not
usually
at
a
loss
for
words
with
my
reviews
but
this
one
had
me
there
it
was
just
that
good
i
really
look
forward
to
the
brandy
and
bourbon
barrel
aged
editions
later
this
year
they
will
truly
be
breathtaking
as
i
can
only
imagine
the
heights
to
which
this
one
will
get
pours
dark
brownmahogany
with
a
brown
head
heavy
dark
friut
aroma
with
lots
of
oak
rich
and
very
malty
with
lots
of
fruity
goodness
up
front
this
was
the
last
beer
of
a
long
night
of
sampling
for
me
and
mike
hopefully
i
will
be
lucky
enough
some
day
to
have
another
bottle
of
this
fine
beer
overall
an
amazing
beer
this
is
one
you
would
consider
as
a
brewing
achievement
pushing
the
envelope
of
style
while
still
incredibly
tasty
drinkability
falling
in
lockstep
with
other
reviews
ive
found
this
to
be
an
ale
worthy
of
the
prized
toptier
the
overall
taste
sensation
is
that
of
a
creamy
and
complex
barleywine
with
excellent
drinkability
despite
the
11abv
the
flavor
profile
jumps
across
a
range
of
flavor
sensations
but
somehow
wraps
it
all
up
into
a
wellbalanced
package
given
the
scarcity
of
angels
share
this
is
a
primo
strong
ale
that
should
be
reserved
for
special
occasions
assuming
you
can
get
your
hands
on
one
d
glad
i
got
one
bottle
for
sure
thanks
to
rallison
and
finally
yes
this
is
truly
a
remarkable
brew
the
best
ive
had
from
lost
abbey
ever
and
lost
abbey
makes
incredible

daily
drinkablility
someone
want
to
share
some
more
with
me
my
favorite
beer
i
have
ever
tried
well
of
the
barrel
aged
at
least
i
could
drink
this
everyday
yummm
by
the
way
only
my
brotherin
law
and
my
cousin
who
works
for
mtv
brasil
liked
this
beer
the
others
thought
it
was
to
strong
and
went
back
to
drinking
their
skol
to
each
his
own
a
muddy
dark
caramel
brown
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
sipping
this
one
at
least
five
times
at
various
beer
fests
in
the
bay
area
the
most
recent
tasting
having
been
at
the
2007
barrel
aged
beer
festival
at
the
bistro
in
hayward
california
this
brew
like
mentioned
above
is
a
dark
muddy
colour
with
a
small
and
thin
offwhitebrownish
head
of
foam
that
dies
quickly
and
is
hard
to
revive
this
brew
in
my
chalice
glass
just
reeks
of
bourbon
and
oak
with
a
heart
dose
of
candied
bready
malts
as
well
hopheads
may
want
to
look
the
other
way
as
this
brew
is
all
about
the
over
the
top
sweet
malts
and
their
caramel
sugary
flavours
which
are
enhanced
by
the
notes
of
bourbon
and
oak
that
are
left
on
this
brew
after
tommes
aging
process
take
hold
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
coating
and
reminiscent
of
a

is

best
us
strong
i
have
hadperiod
got
a
chance
to
try
this
at
the
port
brewery
last
time
we
were
there
during
a
tasting
rich
complex
strong
ale
with
strong
oak
overtones
almost
as
much
of
a
port
as
their
older
viscosity
as
nutty
as
a
good
porter
but
without
the
heaviness
definitely
a
sipping
beer
sort
of
the
opposite
of
a
lawnmower
beer
yes
its
worth
the
price
note
this
beer
makeup
will
change
with
the
different
barrels
that
its
aged
in
and
a
few
other
variables
tried
this
at
the
brewery
this
weekend
and
its
phenomenal
the
brandy
barrels
sweeten
it
up
just
a
touch
compared
to
the
original
but
it
didnt
get
cloying
plenty
of
licorice
cinnamon
and
dried
plums
the
barrel
aged
aspect
of
it
is
its
saving
grace
otherwise
i
would
not
drink
it
prefer
the
bourbon
barrels
aged
version
im
sure
dome
will
disagree
but
this
vintage
was
the
reason
barleywine
should
still
be
made

ounce
375
ml
caged
and
corked
bottle
overall
this
beer
has
mellowed
a
bit
over
the
past
two
years
there
is
no
carbonationhead
but
the
flavors
are
very
complex
the
mouth
is
enjoyable
with
only
a
hint
of
alcohol
which
is
impressive
for
such
a
high
abv
beer
well
done
the
overall
flavor
is
decent
but
the
base
beer
is
too
overpowered
by
the
brandy
barrel
aging
a
little
more
subtlety
would
have
been
nice
but
i
guess
i
should
just
be
glad
there
is
enough
carbonation
to
allow
me
to
drink
it
unfortunately
i
dont
think
i
would
ever
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
carbonated
or
not
its
never
going
to
be
worth
such
a
high
price
tag
overall
this
is
a
pretty
tasty
brew
its
just
a
shame
its
flat
and
pretty
damn
expensive
i
really
wish
i
could
try
this
carbonatedcause
i
think
it
would
be
killer
probably
the
last
lost
abbey
brew
i
will
ever
purchase
i
just
cant
comprehend
the
lack
of
giving
a
crap
about
the
qc
of
their
brews
overall
it
would
be
interesting
to
try
this
beer
if
it
was
not
totally
flat
enjoyed
it
dispite
little
to
no
carbonation
not
sure
its
15
00
worth
if
the
price
drops
ill
consider
purchasing
more
o
this
beer
tastes
great
but
there
are
several
portions
of
it
which
have
you
asking
questions
o
im
on
the
fence
if
this
is
an
infected
bottle
or
not
its
not
over
the
top
with
off
flavors
but
i
dont
think
its
supposed
to
taste
like
this
the
tart
flavor
was
intriguing
at
first
but
got
old
after
a
quarter
of
the
bottle
i
hate
to
pour
out
something
this
pricy
but
theres
other
stuff
in
my
fridge
id
rather
be
drinking
anyway
we
opened
the
bottle
and
it
was
poured
into
a
wine
glass
fitting
for
this
brew
because
it
looked
just
like
a
dark
red
wine
as
it
poured
out
the
beer
had
no
head
on
it
at
all
the
smell
was
very
rich
with
lots
of
sweet
boozy
aromas
we
drank
this
one
slowly
trying
to
savor
everything
we
could
in
this
the
flavors
of
sweet
brandy
and
the
dark
malts
gave
this
beer
a
very
unique
flavor
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
flat
and
didnt
really
spark
my
interest
too
much
it
finished
with
a
dry
aftertaste
and
was
a
little
on
the
boring
side
i
thought
overall
id
like
to
try
it
fresh
not
sure
how
old
the
bottle
was
that
we
had
but
i
would
enjoy
having
it
right
from
the
brewery
o
this
seems
to
be
a
polarizing
brew
for
sure
and
i
can
definitely
see
why
i
respect
it
but
dont
particularly
care
for
it
two
things
kill
this
beer
lack
of
any
carbonation
and
just
the
odd
taste
boy
am
i
pissed
that
i
bought
multiple
bottles
of
this
shit
didnt
realize
it
was
the
brandy
at
the
time
lesson
learned
overall
impression
perhaps
the
most
disjointed
drinking
experience
ive
ever
had
looks
like
crap
smells
great
tastes
ok
but
suffers
immensely
from
flatness
sadly
it
seems
a
few
tweaks
away
from
excellence
correction
one
tweak
away
that
tweak
of
course
being
carbonation
o
very
tasty
although
minicarbonation
it
is
quite
a
good
brew
good
as
well
as
complex
but
develops
quite
a
bit
as
it
warms
o
dont
bother
with
brandy
angels
share
it
really
doesnt
go
well
the
mouthfeel
alone
kills
it
with
the
flatness
but
the
heat
and
lack
of
interesting
flavor
are
enough
to
mock
the
price
far
too
expensive
for
the
experience
had
the
bourbon
before
and
it
was
much
better
would
love
to
try
the
grand
cru
this
is
tasty
with
or
without
carbonation
ill
take
it
either
way
i
do
wonder
how
much
more
i
might
like
it
with
a
bit
of
carbonation
though
this
one
is
flat
that
sucks
but
its
makes
up
for
that
with
flavor
make
no
mistake
this
is
a
rich
beer
but
it
is
darn
tasty
a
little
bit
of
carbonation
would
easily
put
this
at
the
top
of
the
charts
o
i
was
very
let
down
by
this
beer
ive
heard
mixed
reviews
and
all
the
low
carbonation
stories
that
ive
heard
definitely
apply
to
this
beer
under
carbonated
to
a
point
where
it
affects
the
beer
ive
never
had
an
infected
beer
but
this
one
tastes
like
it
might
be
the
sour
notes
come
out
so
strong
and
really
take
away
from
the
experience
i
tried
my
best
to
finish
this
bottle
but
the
taste
was
just
too
much
had
to
drain
pour
this
is
a
very
special
beer
like
other
strong
barrel
aged
ones
it
is
best
after
dinner
as
a
strong
wine
terrible
disappointment
overall
this
is
a
beer
that
highlights
tastes
boldly
that
i
have
only
experienced
hints
of
previously
i
believe
its
at
its
peak
now
cant
imagine
this
keeping
much
longer
and
still
being
carbonated
a
bad
mofo
of
a
beer
and
this
is
a
sipper
worthy
of
a
very
intellectual
conversation
overall
is
really
good
a
16
disaster
i
have
never
had
a
good
version
of
this
beer
but
i
will
never
again
risk
paying
this
much
money
if
this
is
my
reward
overall
its
pretty
good
but
over
priced
big
thanks
goes
out
to
my
boy
lunch
for
sending
me
this
one
in
a
past
trade
2009
vintage
tasted
backtobacktoback
with
bourbon
and
grand
cru
served
from
bottle
into
a
surly
darkness
snifter
poured
a
murky
dark
brown
with
a
basically
nonexistant
offwhite
head
maintained
decent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
caramel
wood
massively
sweet
alcohol
brandy
yum
and
subtle
peat
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
caramel
wood
very
sweet
alcohol
more
brandy
and
subtle
peat
it
had
a
heavy
feel
on
the
palate
with
mild
carbonation
overall
this
was
an
excellent
brew
i
enjoyed
this
one
quite
a
bit
more
than
its
bourbon
counterpart
this
could
have
to
do
with
the
fact
that
i
enjoy
brandy
over
bourbon
but
this
one
was
just
much
sweeter
and
more
inviting
definitely
great
flavor
and
aroma
going
on
here
really
glad
i
got
the
chance
to
try
this
alongside
the
bourbon
version
for
comparison
but
this
one
definitely
took
the
cake
between
the
two
this
beer
was
interetsing
but
definetly
not
what
i
expected
or
hoped
for
especially
for
the
price
overall
remarkable
but
even
a
small
bottle
is
plenty
pours
a
blackish
color
with
a
small
tan
to
no
head
in
the
aroma
dark
fruit
brandy
notes
and
hints
of
alcohol
in
the
taste
brandy
small
oak
notes
and
alcohol
taste
in
the
end
a
smooth
and
medium
to
bigger
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
small
dry
to
sweet
brandy
like
aftertaste
big
brandy
presence
small
oak
notes
and
its
a
sipper
o
not
bad
the
lack
of
carbonation
makes
me
a
bit
worried
but
it
seems
to
taste
good
so
im
willing
to
keep
drinking
o
i
was
a
little
disappointed
not
impressed
with
the
balance
this
may
have
been
a
bad
bottle
i
will
have
to
muster
up
the
courage
to
try
this
one
again
well
made
tasty
as
all
get
out
but
hindered
to
a
certain
extent
but
the
low
low
carbonation
still
a
nice
sipper
for
a
cooler
evening
happy
with
the
purchase
o
the
most
winelike
barleywine
ive
ever
encountered
i
loved
it
but
its
not
for
everyone
personally
id
buy
another
bottle
or
three
but
id
be
cautious
about
recommending
it
it
is
such
a
shame
that
at
this
time
the
beer
is
so
under
carbonated
the
look
of
the
beer
suffered
greatly
because
of
the
lack
of
head
lacing
and
stability
the
mouth
feel
suffered
because
it
became
only
a
bit
watery
feeling
because
of
the
lack
of
carbonation
as
well
everything
else
about
the
beer
is
stellar
i
cant
seem
to
understand
why
after
so
many
years
of
this
beer
being
under
carbonated
that
the
issue
hasnt
been
resolved
i
am
guessing
that
the
yeast
in
the
bottle
and
some
time
on
my
other
bottle
will
hopefully
take
care
of
this
issue
years
down
the
road
though
i
am
not
keeping
my
hopes
up
taste
and
smell
though
is
like
no
other
o
glad
to
have
finally
tried
this
one
overall
its
a
really
good
and
complex
beer
could
be
overhyped
a
bit
but
then
again
i
wouldnt
pass
up
another
bottle
if
i
found
one
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
quite
a
bit
d
this
is
basically
bottled
jack
and
coke
for
fifteen
dollars
honestly
for
the
price
i
am
very
disappointed
if
the
bottle
was
five
dollars
id
be
less
bitter
and
never
buy
it
again
because
im
not
a
huge
fan
for
the
price
i
expected
more
but
this
just
isnt
very
good
im
disappointed
and
saddened
overall
well
worth
drinking
but
i
feel
that
the
three
years
its
had
in
the
bottle
have
been
good
for
it
but
much
more
i
feel
that
it
would
start
to
slip
a
great
beer
overall
though
i
will
always
support
tomme
when
i
get
the
chance
pours
like
the
usual
flat
angels
share
aroma
is
very
intense
dark
molasses
chocolate
loads
of
delicious
dark
fruit
and
fruitcake
blackcurrant
and
straight
up
port
taste
is
caramelized
sugar
intense
cocoa
oak
and
vanilla
bean
very
port
and
sherry
like
no
carbonation
docks
the
flavors
a
touch
mouthfeel
is
round
and
full
bodied
again
portlike
incredible
aroma
sucks
that
its
flat
but
otherwise
a
superb
beer
overall
a
good
beer
i
am
so
glad
it
was
not
completely
flat
or
infected
i
enjoy
it
though
i
do
not
know
if
the
risk
of
the
aforementioned
problems
is
worth
the
dollar
amount
a
lot
of
alcohol
warmth
i
would
love
this
on
a
cold
winter
night
an
incredible
display
of
art
in
the
glass
so
many
incredible
flavors
and
aromas
all
come
together
for
a
near
masterpiece
of
a
beer
d
very
smooth
a
lot
of
barrel
character
maybe
more
barrel
present
than
i
like
but
still
a
great
beer
im
just
thankful
i
got
to
try
it
with
carbonation
o
disappointed
considering
the
cost
i
expected
a
lot
more
and
was
left
with
a
sour
noncarbonated
mess
overall
what
a
waste
of
14
ill
never
buy
this
again
my
friend
bought
two
and
hes
not
happy
overall
this
seems
to
be
a
very
good
beer
with
the
aging
potential
to
be
great
o
the
good
news
is
that
this
isnt
infected
but
the
bad
news
is
that
overall
its
underwhelming
after
a
couple
years
the
booze
is
still
present
and
sharp
the
wood
is
burnt
and
harsh
and
the
appearance
and
mouthfeel
are
subpar
the
brandy
is
very
subdued
compared
to
a
year
or
so
ago
o
the
tomme
needs
someone
to
introduce
him
to
the
refund
total
palettewrecking
wallet
rape
and
ruiner
of
what
could
have
been
a
great
night
of
drinking
the
only
thing
worse
than
these
two
bottles
of
beer
is
the
realization
that
i
still
have
another
one
waiting
taking
up
space
where
my
50
used
to
be
o
i
actually
liked
this
one
a
lot
more
than
i
would
have
thought
and
this
made
a
great
sipper
over
a
few
hours
better
than
the
bourbon
in
my
opinion
dthe
alcohol
burn
fades
a
little
as
it
warms
to
room
temp
but
it
still
lingers
which
really
hurts
the
drinkability
for
me
i
do
enjoy
the
flavor
profile
though
the
price
point
is
really
discouraging
me
from
trying
this
one
again
overall
its
not
very
good
and
i
wont
seek
it
out
again
drink
for
the
money
i
spent
on
this
it
was
well
worth
not
shelling
out
for
the
whole
bottle
i
wouldve
been
dissapointed
this
was
tasty
different
and
a
bit
complex
would
like
the
other
variants
o
better
than
i
expected
given
the
bashing
it
has
received
with
carbonation
this
beer
would
be
an
a
for
me
and
even
without
any
i
am
still
digging
it
pours
a
dark
brown
with
mahogany
highlights
starts
with
very
small
cap
of
khaki
head
gone
very
quick
scent
is
rich
and
complex
notes
of
brandy
port
wine
chocolate
fig
prune
oak
vanilla
lightly
burnt
carmel
taste
combines
all
scattered
notes
of
scent
perfectly
rich
deep
dark
and
complex
a
definite
sipper
full
bodied
lower
carbonation
the
burbon
version
works
a
little
bit
better
with
the
make
up
of
the
beer
deep
and
dark
while
the
brandy
version
adds
a
little
bit
of
brightness
draft
adds
more
to
the
experience
in
body
for
sure
as
opposed
to
bottle
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
a
nice
cloudy
dark
brown
with
a
small
beige
head
that
retains
well
throughout
the
drink
little
to
no
carbonation
visible
loved
the
aroma
big
big
chocolate
smell
with
a
definite
boozy
presence
and
underlying
dark
fruits
taste
of
chocolate
alcohol
and
dark
dried
fruits
up
front
prunes
black
cherries
raisins
molasses
and
brown
sugar
following
with
the
brandiedoak
finishing
things
off
with
a
bite
and
not
quite
dry
tasted
best
when
allowed
to
sit
and
reach
closer
to
room
temperature
full
bodied
strong
and
very
drinkable
but
not
for
the
weak
of
heart
o
this
is
one
of
the
worst
beers
ive
ever
had
i
took
two
sips
and
poured
the
rest
absolutely
horrid
ive
become
more
and
more
leery
of
all
la
beers
tomme
take
care
of
the
issue
good
beer
curious
about
it
without
this
much
aging
and
with
more
also
overall
i
have
a
feeling
the
bottle
was
bad
not
sure
though
not
sure
if
its
worth
the
16
price
point
overall
not
a
bad
beer
i
would
like
to
try
the
bourbon
barrel
one
not
sure
i
would
pluck
down
15
again
for
this
one
but
i
dont
regret
it
overall
a
bit
underwhelmed
i
may
have
to
compare
to
the
bourbon
aging
o
overall
the
flavor
is
pretty
good
but
i
would
like
to
see
what
this
beer
would
be
like
carbonated
what
a
difference
a
little
carbonation
makes
much
of
the
same
look
aroma
and
flavor
profiles
as
my
previous
bottle
review
but
the
carbonation
makes
the
difference
between
a
great
tasting
but
palpably
strange
and
visibly
flat
brew
and
a
world
class
brew
fair
head
and
lace
aroma
and
taste
think
port
with
all
of
the
oak
prune
and
molasses
characteristics
throw
in
a
lively
feel
from
the
carbonation
add
to
this
a
bittersweet
back
end
youve
got
a
spectacular
beer
if
there
were
a
consistency
rating
this
brewery
would
get
a
1
not
a
bad
beer
but
doesnt
match
the
complexity
and
smoothness
of
the
bourbon
version
taste
nice
a
little
sweeter
than
the
bourbon
version
a
definite
sipper
licorice
and
chocolate
seem
there
wood
flavors
raisins
i
think
i
like
the
blended
version
better
ive
seen
a
lot
of
hohum
reviews
of
this
beer
but
i
believe
when
its
properly
carbonated
it
can
be
excellent
it
will
be
interesting
to
see
how
the
corked
bottle
in
the
cellar
compares
to
the
tap
version
im
glad
to
finally
have
an
angels
share
on
tap
a
brilliant
ale
from
lost
abbey
this
is
a
full
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
leaning
towards
low
but
it
is
fitting
and
enjoyable
or
this
offering
any
more
carb
and
it
might
have
been
distracting
lots
of
flavor
and
depth
to
this
sipper
overall
very
enjoyable
and
easy
drinking
considering
the
big
abv
i
have
read
the
reviews
and
honestly
i
was
hesitant
to
open
this
one
up
when
i
realized
it
was
the
brandy
version
ive
tried
deliverance
and
was
impressed
but
this
was
one
of
my
most
unpleasant
beer
experiences
lately
and
by
far
my
lowest
scoring
review
full
syrupy
body
lower
carbonation
but
absolutely
not
flat
sticky
and
chewy
great
flavor
nice
barrel
integration
very
rich
but
an
excellent
beer
the
flavor
is
wonderfully
nutty
and
dessertlike
with
lots
of
caramel
and
dark
wood
w
a
moderate
amount
of
toffee
and
mild
spice
and
nut
in
the
flavor
w
toastiness
and
alcohol
mingling
amongest
the
slight
creamy
taste
of
the
malt
there
is
a
subtle
vanilla
and
mild
bitter
malt
flavor
that
compliments
the
mild
barrel
tannin
level
i
found
this
to
be
good
overall
and
a
incredible
difference
from
the
first
time
i
tasted
thiss
w
the
uncarbonated
version
a
huge
letdown
i
found
this
to
be
the
best
tasting
of
all
the
samples
i
have
tried
of
angels
share
just
head
and
shoulders
above
even
the
bourbon
version
overall
an
exquisite
beer
seek
it
out
it
wont
disappoint
d
drinkability
is
low
on
this
beer
im
not
sure
what
went
so
wrong
with
the
beer
between
the
nose
and
the
taste
but
contrast
is
striking
tantalizing
aroma
but
a
trainwreck
of
flavors
with
no
carbonation
to
boot
crap
dead
flat
no
head
or
bubbles
to
speak
of
probably
skews
my
view
of
this
beer
as
a
couple
of
my
tasting
partners
liked
it
had
some
very
interesting
prune
raisin
and
dark
fruit
flavors
i
liked
the
hint
of
brandy
barrel
i
got
but
it
was
so
sticky
cloying
and
sweet
i
couldnt
look
past
the
fact
that
it
needed
some
carbonation
finished
with
loads
of
alcohol
and
caramel
some
good
bold
flavors
there
but
theyre
too
much
when
a
beer
is
completely
flat
left
half
of
the
pour
in
the
glass
on
the
table
when
i
got
up
and
left
o
huge
disappointment
here
im
glad
i
got
it
out
of
the
way
but
never
again
o
just
a
hot
fucking
mess
of
a
beer
im
not
sure
carbonation
would
have
saved
it
for
me
such
poor
craftsmanship
on
las
part
makes
me
sad
for
anyone
who
buys
this
atrocity
a
hard
pour
down
the
middle
of
the
snifter
results
in
wait
hold
it
absolutely
no
head
at
all
this
is
not
a
propitious
sign
dark
brown
in
color
a
few
spots
of
tan
lace
appear
after
the
glass
is
slightly
shaken
rich
sweet
malts
cherries
and
raisins
some
overly
soured
fruit
damp
wood
spent
grain
and
chocolate
to
the
nose
tastes
sweet
and
near
cloying
with
a
big
hit
of
alcohol
up
front
and
some
chocolate
more
dark
fruits
and
spice
intermingling
move
vinuos
than
beerlike
with
a
watery
mouthfeel
just
cant
get
down
and
make
love
to
this
one
cheers
edit
upon
opening
another
bottle
it
is
slightly
sour
as
well
this
beer
is
a
trainwreck
scores
adjusted
again
lost
abbey
should
be
ashamed
of
themselves
if
a
novice
homebrewer
like
me
can
carbonate
a
big
barleywine
they
can
make
sure
their
overpriced
beer
gets
carbonated
i
dont
expect
to
give
any
more
money
to
these
amateurs
the
threads
were
correct
of
course
no
carbonation
no
head
no
lacing
sux
therefore
mouthfeel
was
way
off
as
well
and
the
total
drinkability
takes
a
serious
hit
not
to
mention
i
paid
like
16
or
17
for
it
but
anyways
just
wanted
to
say
the
nose
was
still
awesome
and
the
taste
wasnt
bad
at
all
i
would
recommend
that
anyone
that
already
has
an
09
in
the
cellar
pop
it
now
because
youre
only
going
to
get
more
disappointed
the
more
time
you
invest
into
it
cheers
d
this
is
flat
as
flat
can
be
this
is
very
sickly
sweet
while
being
horribly
off
with
a
charcoal
and
graphite
bitterness
no
thank
you
i
far
preferred
the
bourbon
barrel
variation
better
especially
considering
it
wasnt
flat
glassware
tulip
highly
disappointed
as
i
have
tried
several
other
beer
by
portlost
abbey
and
have
not
been
disappointed
more
than
likely
i
will
try
this
again
but
it
is
tough
shelling
out
12
for
a
beer
and
being
completely
unsatisfied
d
at
18
months
out
give
or
take
dont
know
exactly
when
in
2009
this
was
blendedbarreledbottled
its
hard
to
imagine
this
as
the
brewers
vision
still
quite
warm
almost
flat
and
quite
sweet
a
small
bottle
is
finishable
but
only
given
ample
time
i
still
have
another
bottle
and
will
hope
that
itll
improve
as
such
a
disappointment
but
tryworthy
as
a
reco
carbonation
head
and
lacing
would
elevate
this
beer
to
a
much
higher
rating
overall
rather
disappointing
for
this
reason
and
certainly
not
worth
the
pricetag
i
paid
for
it
but
the
potential
for
excellence
is
right
there
very
solid
and
i
cant
complain
since
its
my
first
angel
share
im
very
impressed
drink
with
caution
d
great
flavor
and
smell
on
this
brew
fantastic
i
enjoyed
this
one
very
much
dont
think
i
can
drink
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
in
the
end
the
worst
part
to
me
is
seeing
all
the
potential
great
things
in
this
beer
ruined
by
being
completely
flat
id
say
if
you
can
find
a
recent
edition
of
this
beer
that
you
know
for
a
fact
is
carbonated
and
is
at
a
reasonable
price
give
it
a
shot
otherwise
avoid
d
very
smooth
overall
not
to
potent
on
the
brandy
or
to
roasted
etc
was
a
pleasure
to
have
this
is
a
case
where
they
should
have
made
ten
the
loudest
instead
of
going
to
eleven
its
overpowering
and
crass
and
seriously
in
need
of
carbonation
okay
so
the
12
00abv
is
not
very
hidden
thats
okay
actually
the
flavor
lends
this
one
to
be
more
like
drinking
alcohol
than
beer
anyway
so
it
works
out
alright
a
sipper

be

nonetheless
still
very
glad
to
have

it
at

once

make

presents
itself

maybe
even

balanced

beers
i

ever
had
i
have
a

tucked

and
i
cant
wait
to
do
some
vertical
tasting
with
the
different
vintages
of
brandy
and
bourbon
aged
varieties
di
could
drink
several
of

if

im
biased
on
this
as
i
love
brandy
and
have
been
waiting
to
try
this
for
quite
some
time
yes
its
flat
which
hurts
the
score
overall
but
i
think
the
flavor
is
just
about
perfect
some
chocolate
is
added
but
the
brandy
mixed
with
the
raisin
oak
flavor
was
in
such
a
way
that
it
was
like
candy
on
my
tongue
the
problem
was

this

couldve
been
saved

if

can
keep
up

then
i
might
just
pick
up
another
bottle
in
the

also

somewhat

the

really
kills

would
probably
be
helped
with
some
age
in
the

reducing
the
alcohol
notes
a
bit
i
could
of
had
another
this
is
an
overpriced
bottle
and
despite
all
the
problems
surrounding
this
release
and
on
the
forums
d
i
want
to
keep
drinking
this
but
i
also
dont
want
to
fall
on
my
face
a
great
strong
ale
in
that
it
hides
the
alcoholic
burn
but
its
present
enough
to
remind
you
what
youre
drinking
very
impressive
and
quite
different
from
the
bourbon
barrel
version
excellent
stuff
its
a
big
complex
beer
and
well
worth
getting
hold
of
drinkability
is
moderate
to
high
the
flavor
profile
is
nice
which
makes
for
good
drinking
the
alcohol
is
fairly
high
but
well
incorporated
so
i
have
no
major
qualms
there
unfortunately
the
lack
of
carbonation
is
definitely
an
issue
for
me
all
in
all
its
a
good
beer
but
it
could
be
better
d
this
beer
was
a
challenge
to
review
trying
to
put
aside
its
once
lofty
status
as
well
as
its
well
known
issues
was
difficult
while
im
pretty
sure
this
isnt
what
tommy
envisioned
when
he
brewed
it
or
what
the
majority
of
bas
expected
when
they
purchased
the
result
is
a
still
enjoyable
misstep
a
750ml
is
a
little
tough
to
work
through
solo
but
this
is
far
from
the
drain
pour
that
many
bas
make
it
out
to
be
i
keep
taking
sip
after
sip
and
seem
to
be
having

hard

have

certainly
not

the

doesnt

me
much
i
think
a

feel
would
do
this
beer
well
but
it
drinks
ok
without
it
too
and
at
12
5
it
did
the
job
i
wanted
it
to
do
and
tasted
pretty
good
doing
so
i
liked
this
one
a
little
bit
better
than
the

had
on

no

no

looks

not
even

of

not
impressed
at

with
this
aspect
of
the
beer
smell
was
the
best
part
of
this
one
wood
whiskey
not

huge

tasteful
raisins

dark

and
a

the

in
the

mouthfeel
was
a
bit
light
for
me
very
warm
with
extremely
low

a

with

this

this

but
a
trace
more
would
have
really
made
this
beer
exquisite
a
great
offering
nonetheless
but
definitely
one
to
share
shows
a
very
dark
brown
in
the
glass
with
absolutely
no

the

this

on
that
youd
have
to
drink
over

with
a
cigar
overall
yet
another
disappointment
from

they
continue
to
baffle
me
their
duck

gooze
cable

and
isabelle
proximus
are
hall
of
fame
beers
and
among
my
alltime
favorites
but
multiple
others
are
just
flat
uncarbonated
disasters
i
got
this
one
for
free
from
a
buddy
or
id
be
pissed
about
spending
30
for
a
flat
beer
not
bad
has
potential
i
have
another
bottle
that
ill
age
for
a
few
years
in
hopes
it
carbs
up
the
mouthfeel
is
incredibly
thin
and
there
is
no
carbonation
at
all
in
this
beer
if
this
were
carbonated
it
would
be
better
than
the
bourbon
version
the
flavors
are
more
balanced
and
the
scent
is
awesome
but
the
drinkability
is
awful

out
smells
of
extreme
chocolate
covered
raisins
and
rasberries
there
is
enough
carbonation
in
taste
to
keep
it
alive
thats
a
plus
a

of

taste

dark

this

some
roasted

doesnt

at
all
funky
taste

like

not
sure
how
to
rate
this
doesnt
taste
like
any
beer
ive
had
before
better
as
it
warms
some
chocolate
taste
comes
out
dark
fruit
like
fig
d
keeping
in
mind
that
it
is
a
12
strong
ale
aged
in
brandy
barrels
this
is
quite
a
drinkable
beer
one
might
call
it
a
great
sipper
i
was
excited
to
try
this
on
tap
because
the
bottles
i
had
were
amazing
one
of
my
favorite
beers
of
all
time
this
batch
was
way
too
boozy
and
not
very
well
balanced
avoid
and
try
to
find
some
bottle
from
2007
that
arent
infected
d
cant
drink
this
anymore
me
and
my
friend
dumped
it
all
down
the
sink
its
that
bad
what
a
complete
waste
of
money
this
beer
should
never
have
been
released
or
once
it
got
out
it
should
have
been
recalled
mouth
feel
is
appalling
not
appropriate
for
the
style
not
mildly
carbonated
not
even
close
dead
flat
dishwater
smells
pleasant
enough
and
you
can
vaguely
see
the
potential
of
what
it
could
be
if
it
were
properly
carbonated
but
its
not
it
is
hard
to
even
describe
this
swill
as
beer
it
reminds
me
more
of
a
glass
of
iced
tea
after
all
the
cubes
have
melted
as
a
patron
sinner
i
am
very
disappointed
that
lost
abbey
let
this
one
out
of
the
brewery
d
so
much
going
on
with
this
beer
very
enjoyable
even
without
the
carbonation
would
love
to
try
a
carbonated
bottle
normally
oak
aged
beers
have
an
overpowering
wood
chip
smell
and
taste
not
the
case
with
this
beer
very
well
balanced
and
oak
does
nothing
but
enhance
the
flavors
this
is
a
sipping
beer
with
a
mandatory
2
minute
break
inbetween
sips
if
this
beer
played
call
of
duty
5
it
would
def
be
a
5
star
general
md
this
portion
is
a
bit
from
memory
i
wont
judge
based
ona
bottle
suffering
from
a
well
documented
issue
at
the
ebf
i
remember
a
significant
liveliness
yet
highly
drinkable
i
know
that
after
the
ebf
it
became
kind
of
my
white
whale
and
when
i
saw
a
bottle
i
spared
no
expense
hopefully
the
carbonation
issues
will
behave
been
settled
and
i
can
have
this
great
brew
from
a
great
brewery
again
ah
well
at
least
it
was
carbonated
mouthfeel
is
fantastically
thick
smooth
and
velvety
on
the
palate
and
in
my
imagination
it
is
perfectly
carbonated
but
since
in
reality
it
is
not
at
all
carbonated
the
mouthfeel
sucks
drinkability
is
also
imaginatively
huge
it
will
age
well
and
is
possibly
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
d
i
personally
would
want
to
split
a
bottle
several
ways
due
to
the
rich
nature
also
the
fact
that
one
should
share
something
so
awesome
aroma
doesnt
betray
the
abv
this
is
a
smooth
smell
of
caramel
light
chocolate
vanilla
and
a
touch
of
very
dry
timber
oh
how
i
wish
it
were
colder
outside
and
the
fireplace
lit
anywho
the
taste
follows
the
aroma
the
caramel
is
a
bit
thicker
and
the
vanilla
clings
to
the
woodiness
almost
seems
like
a
carbonated
port
some
chocolate
comes
and
goes
as
well
as
unripe
figs
and
apricots
very
nice
i
likey
like
this
one
alcohol
does
hit
hard
in
the
end
id
like
to
see
this
one
age
a
bit
longer
d
i
admit
that
i
came
into
this
with
a
chip
on
my
shoulder
i
had
all
kinds
of
nasty
things
in
mind
that
i
intended
to
write
it
pains
me
to
say
it
but
this
great
beer
is
only
a
couple
bubbles
away
from
being
worldclass
as
great
as
it
was
this
is
most
likely
my
last
lost
abbey
offering
they
have
taken
a
beating
in
the
forums
in
recent
months
and
deservedly
so
to
repeatedly
release
flat
beer
is
baffling
and
unacceptable
plain
and
simple
beer
needs
to
be
carbonated
before
it
is
sold
the
onus
should
not
be
on
the
consumer
to
properly
store
a
beer
while
it
carbonates
before
it
can
be
consumed
to
do
so
without
a
word
of
warning
to
the
public
is
particularly
outrageous
because
they
have
failed
to
do
this
more
than
once
their
customer
service
record
is
irreperably
damaged
in
my
eyes
its
a
shame
that
such
talented
brewer
would
treat
his
customers
with
such
disdain
no
more
la
for
me
save
your
30
the
bad
experience
stories
are
true
much
as
i
wanted
to
see
them
wrong
a
little
dry
but
a
tasty
take
on
the
style
id
say
the
carbonation
issues
with
this
were
overrated
despite
all
of
this
i
still
almost
want
to
call
this
a
world
class
beer
even
in
its
current
state
it
is
so
close
just
a
smidgen
of
carbonation
would
have
been
satisfactory
can
i
get
a
smidgen
please
overall
disappointment
want
to
try
another
vintage
nevertheless
its
been
a
joy
to
drink
a
pleasure
its
the
kind
of
crazy
complex
brew
that
the
beer
aficionado
requires
from
time
to
time
much
thanks
tom
much
thanks
drinkability
relatively
low
its
just
a
little
too
boozy
for
my
liking
yes
the
taste
was
good
and
solid
but
with
that
kind
of
alcohol
burn
its
more
like
drinking
light
spirits
than
enjoying
a
great
brew
d
tastes
great
and
smells
wonderful
the
carbonation
problem
is
the
only
downfall
for
this
beer
really
tastes
great
could
be
one
of
the
best
in
the
world
but
well
as
i
already
mentioned
it
has
no
carbonation
what
a
great
beer
this
had
been
40
is
a
lot
of
money
to
spend
on
a
defective
product
had
this
been
well
carbonated
i
would
do
it
again
but
given
the
circumstances
i
would
like
to
return
my
second
bottle
for
a
refund
served
in
tulip
glass
at
about
45
degrees
fahrenheit
poured
muddy
amber
chill
haze
perhaps
next
to
zero
carbonation
strong
vanilla
and
oak
flavor
with
malty
sweetness
vanilla
and
tobacco
scent
alcohol
certainly
noticeable
in
flavor
but
not
overwhelming
slightly
slick
mouth
feel
paid
45
at
the
foodery
in
philadelphia
while
i
appreciate
the
artistry
in
this
brew
it
is
not
quaffable
at
all
but
perhaps
it
should
not
be
i
really
wanted
to
like
this
beer
and
was
prepared
to
deal
with
a
little
funkiness
from
the
barrel
but
the
lack
of
carbonation
can
not
be
ignored
sadly
i
will
never
pay
my
own
money
for
this
beer
unless
the
price
drops
in
half
incredibly
hot
to
the
point
where
my
mouth
is
burning
every
flavor
in
the
scent
is
echoed
in
the
taste
very
nice
burnt
caramel
and
toffee
flavors
that
mix
well
with
the
vanilla
and
oak
tastes
fairly
roasted
unfortunately
the
lack
of
carbonation
really
kills
this
beer
i
really
wish
this
could
have
been
had
ontap
d
if
i
wasnt
going
to
an
epic
tasting
after
this
i
would
have
drunk
the
hell
out
of
this
and
the
bourbon
as
on
tap
excellent
beers
along
with
ddg
the
only
beers
i
kept
wanting
to
drink
in
the
100
degree
heat
big
thanks
to
scrizz
for
sending
that
beer
to
my
house
hv
met
and
exceeded
high
expectations
not
sure
what
happened
with
the
09
batch
but
if
there
is
any
08
left
seize
it
immediately
d
although
it
obviously
suffers
from
the
lack
of
carbonation
its
still
a
really
good
beer
perhaps
it
could
have
been
slightly
less
boozy
but
the
brandy
flavors
give
it
a
rather
rich
character
this
beer
poured
with
zero
head
it
is
flat
and
i
mean
flat
like
tap
water
not
a
single
bubble
to
be
found
smells
great
but
it
is
a
subtle
smell
the
nose
is
full
of
vanilla
caramel
plum
and
boosy
goodness
the
taste
is
very
similar
with
loads
of
over
ripe
fruit
vanilla
and
sweet
brandy
however
this
beer
feels
horrible
in
the
mouth
it
is
overly
sweet
and
hard
to
swallow
i
refuse
to
pour
this
expensive
beer
out
so
i
tried
to
sip
slowly
and
enjoy
how
can
a
big
brewery
mess
a
beer
up
like
this
i
have
had
beers
carbonate
slowly
before
they
tend
to
only
have
a
bit
of
bubbles
after
a
few
months
in
the
bottle
after
8
months
those
beers
finally
have
full
carbonation
this
is
different
there
is
no
sign
of
bottle
fermentation
i
am
afraid
this
brew
will
never
carbonate
i
have
one
more
bottle
in
the
cellar
it
will
sit
there
for
the
next
3
years
then
i
will
revisit
i
pray
for
carbonation
lost
abbey
needs
to
learn
about
quality
control
oh
well
at
least
the
cdt
was
somewhat
carbonated
2008
750ml
bottle
drank
on
july
10th
2009
615pm
very
light
tiny
pop
pours
a
jet
black
with
maybe
50
small
brown
bubbles
on
a
vigorous
pour
headring
disappears
after
a
minute
or
two
smell
is
wonderful
from
clean
dark
fruits
to
candied
brandy
and
all
the
smells
of
your
childhood
if
your
parents
were
lushes
mouthfeel
of
water
no
carbonation
like
drinking
a
pussy
version
of
sa
triple
bock
but
its
actually
very
easy
to
drink
unlike
the
3x
bock
quite
a
lot
of
heat
comes
through
but
for
12
not
that
bad
even
a
light
touch
of
carbonation
would
have
been
nice
flavours
of
oak
smoke
tar
chocolate
plums
cherry
brandy
youre
like
a
bone
with
a
bone
i
can
see
why
people
got
pissed
about
this
brew
god
the
potential
this
beer
has
to
be
great
and
the
way
lost
abbey
went
about
it
is
unexcuseable
money
grubbers
but
that
being
said
a
nice
brew
but
all
and
all
a
disappointment
ya
i
said
bump
uglies
so
what
you
wanna
fight
about
it
it
will
take
alot
for
me
to
buy
lost
abbey
beer
again
thanks
tomme
i
hope
you
enjoy
my
32
youre
a
fuckin
crook
honestly
i
did
kinda
enjoy
this
beer
in
a
weird
way
but
basically
it
is
a
mess
d
when
my
friend
picked
this
one
up
i
really
wanted
to
try
it
and
to
like
it
ive
never
been
disappointed
with
something
ive
personally
purchased
from
lost
abbey
however
this
beer
was
flat
and
it
wasnt
my
bottle
it
was
the
whole
batch
the
flavor
smell
and
complexity
of
this
english
barleywine
are
fantastic
however
the
flat
bottle
made
this
one
nearly
undrinkable
several
people
we
offered
tastes
to
replied
that
it
was
much
more
like
liquor
than
beer
d
beer
should
be
adequately
carbonated
this
beer
is
not
and
is
almost
undrinkable
while
the
recipe
is
perfect
the
absence
of
carbonation
takes
away
from
an
otherwise
fantastic
beer
avoid
the
2008
batch
unless
ontap
pours
a
murky
brown
that
disappointingly
has
no
head
and
no
film
on
top
there
are
bubbles
in
the
beer
but
they
take
a
close
look
to
notice
smell
is
caramel
and
booze
boring
its
hard
to
taste
this
when
i
cant
get
past
the
fact
that
its
flat
mouthfeel
is
absolutely
horrible
its
almost
like
im
drinking
a
beer
thats
been
opened
for
a
week
drinkability
is
bad
too
i
just
cant
give
this
a
good
review
the
32
price
tag
makes
it
that
much
worse
i
feel
as
though
ive
been
duped
oh
well
thats
life
on
tap
this
beer
is
rivaled
by
very
few
from
any
serving
type
it
still
is
in
the
upper
echelon
aroma
and
flavor
wise
from
the
bottle
however
its
mouthfeel
takes
more
away
than
it
contributes
first
thing
about
drinkability
is
that
this
is
a
nearly
flat
beer
that
costs
33
a
bottle
tasty
beer
but
that
flaw
isnt
a
point
of
recommendation
for
33
they
should
be
able
to
put
the
fizz
in
this
beer
stirs
up
as
much
passion
in
people
as
religion
and
politics
after
months
of
reading
about
this
one
it
was
time
to
remove
it
from
its
resting
place
i
was
not
holding
out
much
hope
for
this
one
so
the
disappointment
level
was
reduced
i
know
they
are
offering
reconditioned
versions
of
the
375
ml
bottles
but
i
feel
that
is
way
too
much
of
a
hassle
since
they
released
a
flawed
but
safe
to
drink
product
i
am
going
to
review
that
version
i
feel
that
this
has
the
makings
of
a
great
beer
it
smells
great
and
the
flavors
of
the
beer
were
quite
apparant
i
would
be
willing
to
try
the
next
version
provided
there
was
quality
control
checks
to
guarantee
the
beer
was
truly
ready
for
consumption
for
the
price
i
dont
think
ill
be
pursuing
this
brew
anytime
soon
its
certainly
one
to
try
if
youre
at
all
a
fan
of
old
ales
or
old
stock
ales
j
w
lees
harvest
ale
old
engine
oil
etc
all
that
said
this
here
draught
version
is
pretty
nice
lifealteringly
phenomenal
probably
not
but
give
credit
where
credit
is
due
and
constructive
criticism
where
thats
due
as
well
thanks
to
adamdc
rock
on
rockstar
o
k
there
i
said
it
its
really
good
d
god
do
i
wish
i
knew
what
this
beer
was
like
with
some
decent
carbonation
i
think
it
could
be
a
world
class
beer
if
it
had
some
form
of
mouthfeel
that
was
other
than
just
the
viscosity
of
this
beer
would
i
drop
30
bucks
on
this
beer
again
if
i
knew
it
was
a
carbonated
bottle
yes
probably
but
im
not
sure
if
im
willing
to
risk
another
30
bucks
on
a
gamble
not
as
terrible
as
people
make
it
out
to
be
but
dropping
30
bucks
you
would
hope
that
you
get
the
product
the
brewer
intends
you
to
get
overall
i
can
see
how
this
beer
was
rated
highly
at
one
point
and
is
now
floundering
it
has
great
potential
but
seems
a
bit
heavy
on
the
alcohol
and
unfortunately
it
is
completely
flat
and
this
wrecks
the
beer
i
think
i
would
try
it
again
if
i
knew
that
it
was
going
to
be
served
the
way
it
should
be
a
bit
disappointing
but
i
will
continue
to
remain
optimistic
bottle
poured
a
deep
murky
brown
color
ale
with
no
head
whatsoever
aroma
of
of
alcohol
vapor
with
some
gross
residual
sugar
taste
is
overly
dominated
by
brandy
notes
with
some
sweet
sugary
malt
with
an
almost
gross
feel
body
is
full
with
no
carbonation
and
strong
alcohol
showing
i
know
the
issue
this
beer
had
with
carbonation
but
the
fundamental
issue
are
bigger
then
only
carbonation
way
too
much
alcohol
is
showing
even
though
i
understand
beer
as
been
barrelaged
with
a
lack
of
complexity
i
must
admit
that
this
example
is
definitely
overhyped
and
fall
well
below
my
expectations
so
i
read
the
guys
review
below
me
and
he
declared
his
as
not
flat
though
really
undercarbonated
this
is
completely
flat
like
a
smidge
above
water
and
really
it
ruins
everything
for
me
30
drain
pour
but
you
live
and
learn
ok
not
flat
one
micron
this
side
of
flat
if
flat
baseline
was
water
this
beer
would
have
to
be
3
or
4
times
more
carbonated
than
it
is
to
be
a
low
carbonated
beer
wasted
30
bucks
but
now
i
can
at
least
object
with
authority
drinkability
for
me
it
wasnt
quite
deserving
of
the
perceived
inflated
hype
and
permissive
praise
nor
was
it
one
of
the
accused
loathsome
issueprone
bottles
so
i
hit
happily
somewhere
in
the
middle
a
fine
beer
to
accompany
me
through
a
few
episodes
of
house
and
catching
up
on
my
email
addendum
retried
now
in
september
another
drainpour
it
is
obvious
that
waiting
longer
will
not
help
this
absolutely
horrendous
beer
the
yeast
is
not
viable
do
not
waste
your
money
very
light
almost
nonexistent
carbonation
all
in
all
not
very
pleasant
will
try
again
in
the
future
lost
abbey
is
going
to
be
stuck
with
these
kinds
of
reviews
and
conclusions
if
it
releases
beer
unreasonably
early

heres
hoping
the

mouthfeel

and
smooth
nearly
flat
in
response
to
the
carbonation
issues
ive
heard
about
sure
it
was
a
bit
flat
even
on
tap
but
nothing
to
end
your
marriage
or
break
your
flat

joke
first

has
less

predicted
chocolate

oak
just
a
tiny
bit
of
smokiness
this
must
have
been
for
the
dark

the
abv
really
starts
cooking
on
the
finish
and
does
drown
out
some
of
the
subtlety
and
complexity
id
hoped
for
not
sure
how
this
would
hold
up
in
the
bottle
but
some
more
maturation
might
help
it
calm
down
a
bit
there
is
no
carbonation
im
not
sure
if
that
is
expected
like
the
label
states
make
sure
you
share
overall
very
very
good
pretty
drinkable
too
for
a
12
barleywine
it
would
make
sense
for
there
to
be
more
alcohol
heat
but
it
swallows
pretty
smooth
all
around
really
nice
and
i
cant
wait
to
try
the
bourbon
aged
version
to
compare
thanks
for
all
the
hype
and
not
backing
it
up
angels
share
here
is
your
bad
advertising
from
one
really
pissed
off
customer
despite
the
well
documented
and
accurate
posts
about
the
lack
of
carbonation
i
bought
a
bottle
to
split
with
some
friends
a
very
slight
pop
poured
no
head
whatsoever
the
beer
is
flat
however
in
the
vein
of
sam
adams
utopias
this
beer
really
doesnt
need
the
carbonation
the
brandy
barrel
aging
comes
through
big
time
in
the
aroma
flavor
was
that
of
sherry
with
a
little
bit
of
oak
like
most
high
alcohol
beers
it
is
on
the
sweeter
side
not
cloying
but
more
a
a
rich
caramel
sweetness
depsite
the
lack
of
carbonation
the
beer
is
medium
to
full
bodied
a
great
beer
and
much
maligned
in
my
opinion
because
it
doesnt
need
the
carbonation
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
chewy
warming
on
the
way
down
and
decently
creamy
throughout
i
would
hesitate
to
drink
too
many
of
these
its
a
huge
beer
with
a
high
a
b
v
definitely
a
treat
not
a
session
d
no
thanks
for
the
2008
version
im
going
to
review
once
again
when
i
crack
a
bottle
thats
a
different
vintage
this
one
is
a
nogo
i
have
to
drainpour
this
bottle
couldnt
drink
this
any
longer
d
this
is
the
second
time
i
have
gotten
to
try
this
gem
of
a
beer
and
the
taste
has
been
incredible
each
time
i
know
people
are
complaining
about
the
carbonation
issues
but
i
think
the
controversy
is
a
bit
overblown
in
the
context
of
this
beer
bottle
2008
pours
a
murkey
brown
with
no
noticable
head
what
so
ever
has
a
wonderful
aroma
of
wood
sweet
fruits
vanilla
and
sweet
caramel
has
a
awesome
flavor
very
lightly
carbinated
an
awesome
mouthfeel
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
very
well
balanced
has
a
great
mouthfeel
a
real
good
finish
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
makes
me
wish
i
was
an
angel
for
my
share
very
well
done
verdict
orgasmic
hopefully
this
beer
will
correct
itself
with
time
but
unfortunately
had
to
drainpour
my
bottle
about
half
way
through
very
disappointed
with
this
beer
especially
after
how
much
i
liked
the
bourbon
barrel
version
drinkability
tremendous
beer
whatever
type
it
may
be
considered
full
body
silks
over
my
palate
with
ease
perfectly
delicate
carbonation
delicious
stuff
definitely
one
of
my
favorites
this
makes
me
weak
in
the
knees
every
time
i
taste
this
wow
on
tap
at
the
ebf
this
past
saturday
the
only
brew
i
took
notes
on
all
weekend
enjoyed
2
large
sized
samples
that
were
truly
savored
poured
burnt
dark
chocolate
near
black
under
a
fierce
looking
dark
tan
head
sticks
and
sticks
and
emits
loads
of
raisins
and
bourbon
to
the
waiting
nose
rich
chewy
and
complex
in
the
mouth
and
around
the
tongue
i
picked
up
luscious
notes
of
more
raisins
dark
chocolate
bourbon
vanilla
ripe
dark
fruits
lovely
beer
2009
brandy
barrel
on
tap
at

lost

night
pours
nearly
black
with
a
tiny
head
and
no
lacing
strong
aroma
of
brandy
dark
fruits
sweet
toffee
vanilla
and

the
last
angels
share
i
enjoyed
was
the
bourbon

and
this
is
my
favorite
of
the
two
delicious
brandy
character
throughout
with
hints
of
vanilla
and
oak
alcohol
is
strong
but
i
love
it
the
finish
is
long
sweet
and
full
of
brandy
one
of
my
favorite
barleywines
full
bodied
with
lowmedium
carbonation
d
my
1
at
toronados
no
doubts
d
pretty
intense
two
glasses
at
most
for
me
on
a
side
note
i
cant
believe
this
stuff
was
3
50
with
the
happy
hour
pricing
god
i
love
toronado
this
is
a
great
sipper
that
will
be
enjoyed
through
the
night
glad
i
got
to
try
it
and
it
wasnt
infected
i
must
say
this
is
defiantly
my
favorite
american
strong
ale
i
have
tried
so
far
i
will
defiantly
seek
another
angels
share
out
for
the
future
pours
dark
brownmahogany
with
a
brown
head
heavy
dark
friut
aroma
with
lots
of
oak
rich
and
very
malty
with
lots
of
fruity
goodness
up
front
this
was
the
last
beer
of
a
long
night
of
sampling
for
me
and
mike
hopefully
i
will
be
lucky
enough
some
day
to
have
another
bottle
of
this
fine
beer
2006
version
at
gabf
multiple
samples
over
several
days
perhaps
the
best
beer
at
the
whole
festival
at
least
the
very
best
barrel
aged
beer
chocolate
caramel
toffee
fruit
brandy
complex
very
concentrated
great
finish
the
2006
was
a
brilliant
beer
and
was
the
standout
at
the
2007
gabf
as
well
im
concerned
about
my
remaining
bottles
of
2007
though
this
is
a
great
beer
though
i
definitely
prefer
the
bourbon
version
very
drinkable
for
the
abv
and
i
look
forward
to
the
newest
version
coming
soon
pours
darker
copper
slightly
hazy
with
a
small
ring
of
bubbles
around
the
edges
alcoholic
nose
mostly
brandy
slightly
medicinal
oaky
and
a
hint
of
pine
tar
lovely
creamy
feel
brandy
up
front
but
not
as
powerful
as
in
the
bourbon
barrel
version
vinuous
flavors
of
red
wine
and
fresh
white
grapes
throughout
a
bit
of
cream
and
vanilla
and
a
warm
alcohol
finish
i
thought
this
was
superior
to
the
bourbon
barrel
pours
a
very
dark
brown
in
color
some
ruby
highlights
that
give
the
sense
of
reddishpurple
highlights
smell
is
very
dark
ripe
fruits
plus
a
lot
more
brandy
than
i
was
expecting
this
is
incredibly
boozy
taste
reaffirms
the
nose
i
cant
get
over
how
much
brandy
flavor
is
in
this
beer
you
can
barely
taste
the
underlying
barleywine
this
is
a
brandy
bomb
still
some
dark
fruits
trying
to
make
their
presence
known
but
the
brandy
barrel
just
wont
let
that
happen
this
is
a
huge
very
big
beer
ive
yet
to
have
anything
even
close
to
this
experience
d
this
one
needs
to
be
sipped
because
its
such
a
huge
beer
thanks
so
much
for
sharing
pwoods
the
grand
finale
beer
on
cask
at
the
lost
abbey
barrel
tasting
reddish
brown
appearance
not
nearly
as
much
carbonation
as
the
bourbon
version
ive
had
from
a
bottle
admittedly
i
had
a
few
beers
by
the
time
i
drank
this
so
my
tongue
could
have
just
been
scorched
but
this
seemed
a
little
rough
around
the
edges
not
quite
as
smooth
as
the
bourbon
version
though
i
hear
maybe
this
is
just
because
we
were
having
a
sneak
preview
of
what
will
not
be
released
in
bottles
until
down
the
road
in
any
event
this
was
still
great
lots
of
dark
fruit
oak
vanilla
carmel
and
what
i
guess
is
brandy
im
not
even
sure
ive
drank
brandy
before
definitely
distinguishable
from
the
bourbon
counterpart
id
love
to
try
the
two
sidebyside
taste
mouthfeel
caramelly
malt
chocolate
caramelized
figs
raisins
mediumfull
in
body
with
low
carbonation
vanilla
beans
subtle
tannins
this
has
a
pretty
upfront
barrel
character
the
brandy
version
is
distinctly
different
from
the
bourbon
barrel
variety
namely
in
the
vinous
fruity
nuance
that
the
brandy
barrel
lends
the
beer
delicious
stuff
poured
a
reddish
brown
color
with
a
thin
light
tan
head
that
left
sticky
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
of
tons
of
dark
fruits
vanilla
oak
cocoa
caramel
malts
and
a
touch
of
alcohol
as
well
taste
of
some
toffee
roasted
malts
dried
fruits
more
oak
and
vanilla
with
a
bit
of
alcohol
in
the
finish
fantastic
barleywine
thanks
eda
not
so
easy
to
drink
due
to
the
sourness

from
and
tasted
on

thanks
dave
this
rare
gem
was
a
real
treat
pours
a
dark
molasses
with
a
t
hin
half
finger
head
that
quickly
dies
down
to
a
thin
ring
of
bubbles
swaying
the
glass
back
and
forth
leaves
a
sticky
webbing
on
the
sides
rich
brown
sugar
and
caramel
engulf
the
senses
with
a
tiny
hint
of
bourbon
sweet
raisins
dates
and
fig
dance
in
the
nose
as
well
heavy
vanilla
and
a
slight
oak
aroma
can
be
detected
too
not
as
strong
smelling
as
i
had
anticipated
but
i
think
thats
why
i
enjoy
it
not
overpowering
taste
is
smokey
sweet
malts
up
front
of
chocolate
caramel
and
butterscotch
woody
vanilla
notes
with
pepper
and
spice
dry
the
mouth
a
tad
an
interesting
pumpkin
bread
flavor
on
the
tongue
as
well
surprisingly
i
find
very
little
alcohol
on
the
tongue
with
this
one
mouthfeel
is
not
nearly
as
heavy
as
i
was
expecting
medium
to
full
silky
smooth
body
with
a
tingling
carbonation
a
sipper
for
sure
but
i
pretty
much
knew
that
would
be
the
case
i
look
forward
to
see
what
a
few
years
will
do
to
this
i
cant
wait
to
try
more
barrel
aged
beers
from
lost
abbey
thanks
again
guys
for
hooking
me
up
with
this
beauty
the
beer
pours
with
a
dark
coffee
color
and
a
small
tan
head
that
clings
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
smell
is
sweet
dark
chocolate
a
light
fruitiness
a
moderate
booze
and
wonderful
barrel
aged
sourness
the
taste
wow
i
had
a
bottle
of
this
fresh
and
on
tap
and
it
had
evolved
it
is
not
as
sweet
and
brandylike
now
and
the
sourness
has
really
become
dominate
sweet
malt
carmel
liquor
filled
chocolates
slight
oakbarrel
brandy
sour
funkiness
from
barrel
aging
oxidation
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
slight
alcohol
burn
and
a
clinging
finish
for
an
11
5
abv
this
beer
goes
down
easily
maybe
too
easily
i
really
like
this
beer
and
am
glad
i
have
few
more
sitting
in
my
cellar
i
hear
the
next
batch
2008
will
be
from
freshly
emptied
brandy
barrels
so
i
look
forward
to
that
beer
bottle
thanks

pours
very
dark
brown
with
deep
reddish
hints
and
a
light
brown

elegant
and
complex
aroma
with
tones
of
chocolate
caramel
nuts
english
toffee
english
fruit
cake
lingonberries
blackberries
maybe
some
blueberry
and
strawberry
jam
and
a
wide
subtle
fruit
spectra
of
raisins
plums
sweet
pears
yellow
apples
and
banana
in
the
background
the
oak
wood
blends
in
very
well
with
soft
tones
of
vanilla
cocoa
nut
and
some
butter
also
some
hints
of
yeast
sugar
spices
peppery
mint
and
sal
ammoniac
well
balanced
alcohol
warmth
carrying
every
aroma
beautifully
the
nose
is
extremely
soft
with
notes
of
gruel
the
flavour
starts
of
with
a
second
of
chocolate
coffee
and
dark
fruit
then
a
rather
full
caramelly
and
fruity
sweetness
comes
along
with
some
fiery
alcohol
the
finish
carries
all
the
sweetness
with
a
balanced
sour
berry
touch
oak
vanilla
and
some
subtle
sugar
sources
goes
through
every
stage
of
the
beer
undertones
of
dark
berries
and
dark
fruits
like
raisins
and
black
currant
lemonade
hints
of
liquorice
salt
and
hops
medium
to
full
sweet
and
syrupy
with
a
light
tart
edge
light
bitter
and
light
dry
the
mouthfeel
is
maybe
the
best
ever
with
a
silky
smooth
and
velvety
character
the
carbonation
is
perfect
for
the
mouthfeel
and
carries
the
beer
gentle
down
your
palate
sugar
chocolate
vanilla
salty
liquorice
and
some
earthiness
linger
in
the
aftertaste
near
full
bodied
what
a
perfect
beer
from
our
new
favourite
brewery
yeah
baby
dwhoa
this
is
some
complex
stuff
hard
to
even
explain
all
that
is
going
on
with
this
concoction
a
wonderful
sipper
one
has
to
try
for
themselves
to
understand
this
is
a
highly
enjoyable
and
palate
stimulating
sipper
a
mighty
fine
drinking
brew
somewhat
thin
upon
drinking
but
a
creamy
texture
does
come
through
on
the
middle
have
two
more
bottles
of
this
so
ill
have
to
try
them
soon
cheers
to
seaoflament
for
this
750ml
bottle
from
2007
this
insanely
delicious
ale
is
a
masterpiece
of
the
brewers
art
if
it
isnt
the
best
american
strong
ale
on
the
planet
then
id
love
to
know
what
is
the
angels
share
brandy
may
be
heavenly
but
this
bottle
is
mine
all
mine
let
the
angels
get
their
own
damn
beer
talisker
deserves
my
undying
gratitude
for
agreeing
to
part
with
one
of
his
bottles
at
the
time
i
am
posting
this
review
i
have
now
had
both
the
brandy
and
bourbon
versions
and
i
can
say
that
the
brandy
version
is
easily
my
favorite
of
the
two
pours
almost
black
with
a
light
tan
head
smell
is
vanilla
raisins
dates
sweet
dried
fruity
and
is
just
bursting
out
of
the
glass
with
goodness
taste
is
super
rich
smooth
creamy
sticky
malt
vanilla
modest
hops
dates
and
decadent
very
drinkable
one
of
my
all
time
favorites
angels
share
might
be
overhyped
but
its
great
stuff
all
the
same
d
as
a
strong
barrel
aged
beer
i
found
this
to
be
very
tasty
i
normally
dont
like
boozy
beer
especially
ones
with
a
lot
of
oak
but
this
beer
was
crafted
well
and
didnt
float
off
in
any
one
direction
i
cant
consume
a
lot
of
this
in
one
sitting
but
a
small
glass
is
very
nice
reviewed
on

well
done
brew
i
felt
bad
about
taking
so
much
for
myself
but
it
was
in
love
with
this
beer
and
the
brandy
complexities
that
it
melded
together
with
beautiful
muddy
and
thick
brown
color
with
a
light
brown
head
that
leaves
very
little
lacing
every
swirl
of
this
angel
produces
a
generous
head
back
smell
is
of
doughy
cookie
and
a
rich
toffee
buttery
and
maple
syrup
boozy
bourbon
notes
taste
is
sweet
and
awfully
creamy
mouthfeeling
is
great
and
allows
you
palate
to
soak
in
all
the
tasty
bourbon
and
leaves
a
lingering
warming
great
beer
thanks
tomme
overall
this
beer
totally
lived
up
to
the
hype
it
was
worth
every
mile
travelled
every
minute
waiting
in
line
and
every
penny
spent
i
only
wish
i
could
have
purchased
more
a
truely
remarkable
beer
and
worthy
of
the
highest
of
scores
props
to
tomme
on
this
amazing
beer
this
is
what
oak
aging
should
be
not
overwhelming
but
smoothing
out
flavors
and
adding
complexity
im
really
looking
forward
to
trying
the
bottles
of
bourbonbarrel
aged
as
overall
i
really
loved
this
one
now
i
have
not
really
had
anything
from
lost
abbey
that
i
have
not
liked
but
this
and
devotion
on
back
to
back
nights
have
really
taken
this
thing
to
a
while
new
level
the
complexity
displayed
in
the
is
uncanny
and
i
really
had
a
touch
time
with
this
review
as
i
am
not
usually
at
a
loss
for
words
with
my
reviews
but
this
one
had
me
there
it
was
just
that
good
i
really
look
forward
to
the
brandy
and
bourbon
barrel
aged
editions
later
this
year
they
will
truly
be
breathtaking
as
i
can
only
imagine
the
heights
to
which
this
one
will
get
ive
been
lucky
enough
to
sample
this
one
several
times
from
the
wood
from
the
keg
and
from
the
bottle
i
do
give
the
nod
to
the
bourbon
barrel
one
for
overall
beauty
especially
from
the
wood
but
this
one
is
damn
fine
as
well
darker
than
most
barleywines
this
one
is
almost
the
colour
of
a
chocolate
terrys
orange
from
the
uk
the
aroma
is
all
brandy
chocolate
malt
lovely
deep
fresh
baked
bread
and
spice
the
taste
is
great
with
a
real
depth
of
chocolate
brandy
and
deep
roasty
malt
flavors
that
are
all
well
integrated
and
integral
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
milkshake
thick
with
a
great
drinkability
good
stuff
i
wish
they
would
bottle
all
in
375s
as
well
because
honestly
without
a
friend
to
split
this
with
a
750
is
too
much
its
flat
and
it
sucks
what
happened
a
fantastically
crafted
beer
with
a
very
nice
barrel
character
i
still
prefer
the
creamier
flavors
and
texture
of
the
bourbon
barrel
version
plain
and
simple
i
love
this
beer
the
fruit
flavors
dark
sugar
sweetness
malt
and
brandy
barrel
is
a
near
perfect
marriage
and
unfortunately
i
dont
think
any
review
can
do
it
justice
the
balance
is
incredible
this
is
a
rich
sipper
that
cuts
drinkability
just
a
tad
update
ive
gotten
to
try
some
bottles
of
this
that
were
not
good
at
all
d
sip
slowly
enjoy
there
is
such
a
complexity
of
flavors
running
through
that
change
as
the
glass
warms
in
your
hand
disappointed
that
this
will
have
probably
have
been
my
one
and
only
angels
share
experience
d
this
beer
is
so
complex
that
it
almost
cuts
down
in
drinkability
your
simple
ape
brain
cannot
even
begin
to
process
what
is
being
thrown
at
it
the
amazing
this
is
that
there
is
not
one
taste
that
really
dominates
one
of
the
best
balanced
beers
i
have
ever
had
kudos
to
the
staff
at
beerbistro
for
the
time
and
effort
involved
in
getting
these
rare
treats
available
in
ontario
it
isnt
easy
and
it
isnt
cheap
but
its
so
worth
it
poured
into
snifters
a
cloudy

thin

down
to

and
is
insanely
smooth
for
such
a
big
beer
very
long
finish
very
rich
one
of
the
best
liquids
ive
ever
put
in
my
mouth
overall
this
was
a
very
nice
treat
i
would
have
expected
this
would
need
more
aging
but
is
very
good
as
is
i
am
very
impressive
with
lost
abbey
good
beer
thankfully
i
have
one
more
to
treasure
and
savor
for
a
future
date
a
must
try
beer
if
you
get
the
chance
i
am
glad
to
have
a
couple
more
of
these
to
age
and
to
possibly
compare
side
by
side
with
next
years
batch
o
man
got
this
straight
from
the
brewery
and
poured
it
into
a
brandy
sniffter
poured
a
lot
darker
than
expected
but
thats
a
good
thing
almost
opaque
with
a
ruby
hue
around
the
edge
the
nose
offers
up
brandy
vanilla
and
oak
carbonation
is
perfect
for
my
taste
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
ever
drinken
im
holding
onto
my
remaing
bottles
for
special
occasions
only
incredible
pours
a
caramel
brown
almost
opaque
with
a
thick
creamy
head
and
contiuous
lacing
nose
is
big
brandy
at
first
followed
by
caramel
chocolate
dark
fruits
and
if
taken
in
altogether
without
picking
them
out
it
smells
like
plain
yogourt
big
brandy
up
front
but
not
boozy
whatsoever
chocolate
brown
sugar
caramel
and
dark
fruits
all
take
their
turn
on
your
pallate
then
a
smooth
as
silk
brandy
finish
insanely
drinkable
and
i
couldnt
detect
half
the
abv
a
world
class
libation
d
there
was
a
decent
amount
of
hype
surrounding
this
beer
as
there
is
surrounding
dark
lord
when
i
finally
tried
dark
lord
for
the
first
time
i
was
a
bit
disappointed
tasting
the
angels
share
for
the
first
time
was
the
exact
opposite
this
beer
is
as
good
as
if
not
better
than
the
hype
as
far
as
im
concerned
the
ease
of
drinking
for
a
beer
of
this
abv
is
incredible
and
the
flavor
profile
is
outstanding
this
really
is
a
world
class
beer
bottle
shared
at
the
beer
bistro
in
toronto
gotta
splurge
sometimes
dark
murky
beer
with
minimal
head
nose
is
off
dark
chocolates
and
fruit
not
what
i
expected
for
a
barleywine
taste
sublime
the
brandy
aging
has
turned
this
into
a
very
unique
beer
hops
are
subdued
so
really
not
that
much
bitterness
just
silky
thick
tootsie
roll
plums
and
raisins
and
vanilla
sweetness
to
name
a
few
almost
seems
like
more
belgian
quad
than
barleywine
great
sipping
beer
but
still
dangerously
drinkable
no
hotness
to
speak
of
just
pure
heaven
this
is
sad
there
is
a
reason
everbody
wants
this
stuff
it
is
amazing
and
i
wish
i
had
not
traded
so
many
of
my
bottles
already
i
do
not
think
any
barrel
aged
beer
will
ever
live
up
to
the
quality
of
this
one
trade
whatever
you
have
in
order
to
get
a
bottle
of
this
and
you
will
not
be
sorry
i
recommend
this
over
them
all
this
beer
is
practically
perfect
how
can
i
leave
the
above
review
intact
this
no
longer
reflects
the
brandy
barrel
angels
share
that
has
been
released
apparently
the
flat
uncarbonated
monstrosity
that
i
purchased
at
an
inflated
price
was
intended
as
an
english
barleywine
with
absolutely
no
carbonation
and
i
was
just
too
dumb
to
realize
it
i
will
average
the
scores
of
one
of
my
favorite
beers
and
come
up
with
something
that
reflects
the
two
vintages
while
i
was
expecting
this
to
be
at
least
good
i
really
am
impressed
how
good
this
really
is
this
beer
really
works
quite
well
with
the
brandy
barrel
this
is
truly
and
enjoyable
sipping
brew
as
the
label
states
750ml
is
definitely
a
good
size
for
slowly
sipping
savoring
amongst
friends
i
really
like
the
flavors
found
in
this
brew
as
well
as
the
silky
textures
of
the
body
mouthfeel
the
two
really
compliment
each
other
quite
well
i
cant
actually
the
texture
of
this
beer
being
any
better
for
this
particular
set
of
flavors
i
really
think
more
brewers
need
to
explore
this
particular
barrel
type
as
i
just
transferred
a
bunch
of
a
belgianstyle
quad
from
a
heaven
hill
brandy
barrel
same
type
of
barrel
used
here
i
believe
that
is
shaping
up
to
be
quite
phenomenal
as
well
speaking
of
which
the
brandy
character
really
seems
to
move
this
beer
into
the
realm
of
a
strong
dark
belgian
beer
like
a
quad
ultimately
i
think
this
is
why
i
like
this
beer
so
much
barrel
barley
wine
did
not
really
excite
me
that
much
but
little
did
i
realize
that
the
combination
would
evoke
the
complexity
fruit
character
that
i
like
so
much
in
a
really
good
quad
quite
surprisingly
at
least
to
this
lover
of
funky
beers
this
is
easily
objectively
removing
the
situational
aspect
the
best
beer
i
have
ever
had
from
tomme
i
really
wish
i
had
at
least
a
couple
more
bottles
of
this
batch
as
i
have
a
feeling
it
is
going
to
age
quite
well
without
the
barrel
character
brandy
oak
derived
this
beer
would
merely
be
at
most
good
and
more
like
just
decent
really
it
is
the
marriage
of
all
of
the
components
of
this
brew
that
make
it
so
incredible
chocolate
rules
here
is
a
barleywine
well
malted
by
the
includion
of
quality
chocolate
and
must
lead
to
an
increase
in
score
because
of
the
darker
look
the
sweeter
chocolate
smell
and
of
course
the
hershey
chocolate
taste
with
brandy
from
the
barells
above
average
mouthfeel
better
more
complex
barleywines
belgiums
of
course
a
very
expensive
choice
of
70
bomber
allin
at
beerbistro
taste
quite
rich
but
never
going
overboard
the
barrelaging
is
just
at
the
right
level
where
brandy
and
rhum
flavors
are
present
but
without
draining
out
the
body
the
booze
flavor
is
there
but
without
the
burning
or
harshness
you
can
find
sometimes
only
a
nice
warm
feeling
in
the
throat
at
the
very
end
the
body
is
quite
malty
and
easy
to
drink
even
at
near
room
temp
surprising
how
it
can
seem
so
simple
in
one
sip
then
throw
you
for
a
loop
the
next
it
just
evolved
and
flowed
and
deserves
all
the
hype
and
then
some
pours
a
dark
brown
in
color
with
ruby
and
copper
hues
in
the
light
a
good
sized
coffee
and
cream
colored
head
slowly
recedes
aroma
is
big
and
rich
sweet
dark
fruits
prunes
figs
and
raisins
some
nice
buttery
caramel
as
well
as
some
strong
leather
saltiness
and
a
grapey
sweet
boozy
brandy
aroma
also
a
hint
of
sweet
red
licorice
taste
follows
the
aroma
nice
raisin
and
prune
barleywine
characteristics
a
decent
sized
grapeyness
somewhat
bready
buttery
caramel
is
also
present
in
the
taste
up
front
finish
is
a
blend
of
dry
woodinessoak
and
a
very
nice
warming
alcohol
medium
to
heavy
in
body
not
overly
thick
or
cloying
the
dryness
from
the
hops
and
the
wood
adds
a
nice
balance
to
the
malty
sweetness
an
outstanding
beer
the
best
ive
had
thius
far
from
the
lost
abbey
definitely
belongs
in
the
american
barleywine
category
my
favorite
style
rather
than
strong
ale
you
can
smell
this
one
over
and
over
and
it
excellent
each
time
the
brandy
comes
thru
quite
well
in
the
aroma
glad
to
have
an
extra
to
lay
down
for
a
little
d
the
oak
is
strong
in
this
one
brilliant
im
totally
digging
these
alternatively
barreled
versions
of
beer
brandy
barrels
sherry
barrels
bourbon
barrelsbring
it
the
beer
poured
a
deep
brown
slighty
amber
body
with
a
thick
tan
almost
redish
hugh
with
some
solid
lacing
around
the
glass
the
nose
is
a
bit
malty
sweet
and
had
a
touch
of
wood
and
the
high
abve
the
taste
is
complex
and
has
some
nice
wood
notes
high
abv
which
brings
out
some
characteritics
of
a
port
or
brandy
this
is
a
sipping
beer
and
with
a
nice
full
body
i
can
see
why
another
treat
from
lost
abbey
d
this
is
an
amazing
beer
it
really
is
a
sipper
with
these
such
strong
flavors
but
it
really
pulls
it
all
off
in
my
eyes
cant
see
myself
sitting
with
a
better
sipper
for
a
special
occasion
this
was
a
great
choice
for
my
300th
brew
after
coming
soo
close
to
finishing
it
i
think
it
can
get
kind
of
sickly
i
think
it
would
be
better
in
a
12oz
when
you
finish
it
you
would
still
be
craving
more
it
has
taking
me
about
close
to
3
hours
to
drink
it
its
great
just
gets
kind
of
cloggy
and
sickly
near
the
end
still
a
great
brew
i
just
had
to
take
some
points
away
from
it
originally
reviewed
november
24
2006
750
ml
bottle
aroma
is
running
away
and
just
out
of
reach
initially
there
are
some
insanely
entirely
rich
bourbon
brandy
emaciated
currants
with
toasted
almost
with
bright
estery
yeast
notes
very
warming
alcohol
with
barrel
drawing
a
bite
in
the
nose
luxious
matuer
fruit
the
aroma
wakes
up
and
glows
a
little
stronger
with
a
little
more
warmth
and
swirling
flavor
is
so
completely
delicious
with
amazing
bourbon
touches
and
a
heavy
head
of
canded
fruit
sugared
mango
and
crystallized
ginger
the
beer
complexity
is
lightly
muddled
and
condensed
into
a
sweet
creamy
dense
flavor
the
flavor
starts
with
a
real
tangy
bright
sweet
pear
then
ascends
to
a
rich
malt
creaminess
over
brandy
flavor
with
piquant
yeast
richness
following
then
a
rising
phoenix
of
flaming
alcohols
appear
from
the
dust
the
alchol
is
enlightening
and
scorches
the
nostrils
but
its
not
disconcerting
this
beer
is
young
and
will
only
get
better
with
time
and
the
alcohols
that
are
perceptible
are
actually
astonishingly
characterfull
so
they
are
well
appreciated
even
notes
of
earth
and
woody
mingle
in
with
a
genuflection
on
the
altar
of
a
competely
seductive
malt
character
figs
in
honey
maple
syrup
candy
next
to
hazlenutchocolate
wafers
all
in
one
it
reminds
me
of
living
in
amsterdam
and
going
down
to
the
market
street
in
the
morning
and
getting
large
fresh
hot
sticky
syrupy
stroopwafels
right
off
of
the
griddle
and
eating
them
right
there
at
the
stall
fresh
of
crusty
caramel
and
wafer
finish
continues
amazing
complexity
with
bright
chinese
cassia
blended
aromatic
pink
and
white
pepper
and
redolent
in
tawn
fruit
oh
wow
its
getting
hard
to
explain
all
the
permutations
of
this
beer
barrel
character
is
only
helpful
and
thats
what
makes
this
beer
so
astonishing
it
doesnt
get
out
of
hand
or
overwhleming
a
true
team
player
adding
yet
another
exciting
delicious
level
finally
a
closing
curtain
of
grassy
mentholness
with
some
sou
spice
and
a
few
more
bright
yeasty
esters
in
juniper
this
beer
has
complete
complexity
and
is
an
all
around
winner
subtleness
and
exacting
execuation
make
this
beer
tops
with
astounding
dry
clarity
and
total
excellence
i
appreciate
the
ability
to
clearly
distinguish
all
the
nuanced
characters
individually
and
culture
appreciate
for
the
niches
of
this
beer
an
amazing
opportunity
first
sip
at
lost
abbey
brewery
2011
with
guillermo
love
strong
alcohol
and
cloyingly
sweet
dark
cocoa
flavor
definitely
a
beer
to
drink
by
the
fire
think
brandy
snifter
with
a
carbonated
raspberry
tinged
after
dinner
liqueur
rich
rich
body
but
with
a
decent
level
of
carbonation
long
raisiny
aftertaste
this
is
the
best
beer
that
i
have
ever
had
drank
it
at
room
temp
in
snifters
and
was
blown
away
way
better
than
any
other
barrel
aged
beer
that
i
have
had
this
beer
is
immense
and
phenomenally
rich
its
definitely
a
sipper
you
couldnt
drink
it
faster
if
you
wanted
to
the
flavor
and
aroma
are
almost
overwhelming
quite
an
experience
dark
sludgy
brown
color
no
carbonation
what
so
ever
molasses
cacao
bourbon
nose
fairly
full
bodied
and
viscous
very
sweet
and
super
boozy
on
the
tongue
dark
and
sweet
lindt
chocolate
carmel
with
the
tiniest
hint
of
black
licorice
actually
as
off
put
i
was
with
the
zero
carbonation
this
is
actually
very
good
very
solid
sipper
a
little
too
boozy
compared
to
better
booze
barreled
brews
a
bit
too
strong
alcoholic
flavor
o
4

this
is
a
very
interesting
beer
and
a
nice
job
of
blending
here
some
aspects
are
top
notch
but
the
flavors
could
be
a
bit
more
integrated
sometimes
sips
are
quite
brandy
forward
while
others
are
more
chocolate
and
bourbon
forward
i
prefer
the
latter
so
hopefully
a
bit
of
time
in
the
cellar
will
result
in
a
more
balanced
flavor
truly
spectacular
beer
poured
a
deep
black
with
a
touch
khaki
head
exactly
what
you
would
expect
from
a
heavy
stout
aroma
is
sweet
and
heavy
brown
sugar
molasses
cocoa
fig
vanilla
bourbon
doesnt
really
have
some
of
the
roastier
notes
or
coffee
that
some
serious
stouts
do
but
im
ok
with
it
taste
is
full
bore
sweet
and
rich
tons
of
vanilla
and
fig
chocolate
and
cherry
very
very
sweet
a
bit
too
much
if
im
honest
feel
is
rich
and
smooth
light
carbonation
overall
a
treat
definitely
a
slow
drinker
o
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
in
a
long
time
o
the
taste
doesnt
deliver
what
the
nose
promises
the
nose
on
this
is
fantastic
creating
a
desire
that
is
not
fulfilled
in
the
taste
its
underwhelming
dont
get
me
wrong
its
a
great
beer
it
just
doesnt
live
up
to
the
nose
oh
and
the
alcohol
is
nowhere
to
be
found
be
careful
with
this
one
o
wasnt
initially
impressed
but
as
time
went
on
the
beer
got
better
and
better
by
the
end
it
was
one
of
the
better
beers
that
i
have
had
it
was
on
pare
with
a
bourbon
county
stout
that
had
been
aged
for
five
years
the
difference
is
that
the
goose
island
beer
is
less
than
half
the
price
if
you
can
find
it
this
so
far
is
my
most
favorite
beer
to
date
even
liked
more
than
bells
black
note
and
founders
kbs
ive
been
told
that
just
about
any
beer
from
lost
abbey
is
amazing
and
this
one
definitely
didnt
disappoint
i
was
at
the
san
diego
ca
stone
liberty
station
bistrobeer
garden
and
they
had
this
by
the
bottle
maybe
23
left
i
was
told
and
glad
to
have
opportunity
to
try
it
my
favorite
beer
what
a
great
beer
very
rich
and
full
with
amazing
length
of
finish
and
an
almost
syrupy
texture
yet
its
not
too
heavy
just
deeply
flavored
the
brandy
and
bourbon
barrels
are
both
in
evidence
with
chocolate
vanilla
and
a
bit
of
scorched
wood
from
the
bourbon
and
a
round
fruity
sweetness
from
the
brandy
as
well
as
a
bit
of
an
edge
seamlessly
integrated
with
an
overall
impression
of
smores
made
with
some
bitter
chocolate
and
a
drizzle
of
booze
delicious
rating

youre
wondering
if
it

o
in
a
word
powerful
reminds
me
of
averys
uncle
jacob
but
not
as
heavy
would
like
to
drink
this
one
again
as
the
weather
cools

big
beer
for
big
occasions
this
is
pretty
good
in
the
future
i
think
id
like
to
buy
one
to
age
you
know
when
i
feel
like
spending
17
on
a
small
beer
again
pours
no
head
very
dark
a
bright
flashlight
cannot
be
seen
through
the
beer

looking
through
the

with
slight
hints
of
brandy
and
fruit
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
full
bodied
goodness
and
it
hangs
around
i
really
like
this
beer
and
it
is
a
must
have
jet
black
and
impenetrable
to
light
just
a
trace
of
dark
brown

sweet

and
loads
of
deepdark
relentless

flavor
is
filled
with

the

gives
a
cooling
sensation

is

very
easy

the
strength
great
find
in
the
words
of
wayne
and
garth
were
not
grateful
my
first
experience
with
being
delivered
and
as
the
label
indicates
sin
is
good
this
is
how
i
envision
a
strong
ale
should
be
pours
dark
as
night
and
carbonation
higher
than
anticipated
pleasant
surprise
there
head
dissipating
fairly
quickly
but
appropriate
to
time
nonetheless
set
up
extremely
well
in
my
bcbs
snifter
admired
the
unique
intense
smell
from
the
combination
of
bourbon
and
brandy
barrel
aging
tis
a
sipper
to
take
your
time
with
and
enjoy
the
sin
pleasure
of
deliverance
pours
a
very
dark
color
with
a
thin
almost
nonexistent
head
probably
due
to
the
barrel

aroma
is
strong
molasses
bourbon
taste
has
a
bit
of
smoke
to
it
sweet
brandy
with
next
to
no
carbonation
quite
the
beast
and
a
sipper
for
sure
this
one
was
a
surprise
its
interested
me
for
a
while
but
i
never
thought
id
be
able
to
try
it
thanks
umberto
o
very
nice
flavors
but
it
lacked
carbonation
maybe
a
bad
cork
seal
i
am
speechless
and
just
flat
out
confused
this
is
overall
the
most
enjoyable
strong
ale
i
have
easily
ever
had
and
i
am
not
even
sure
it
is
one
as
it
walks
the
tightrope
of
bodied
lightness
strong
ale
estered
fruit
with
dark
roasting
imperial
stout
power
regardless
its
just
an
amazing
creation
flat
out
stunned
and
speechless
near
perfection
of
something
that
is
so
imperfect
to
begin
with
so
beautiful
lots
of
cocoa
with
an
inspiring
contribution
from
the
bourbon
and
bandy
barrels
the
flavors
seem
to
just
meld
into
something
reminiscent
of
a
great
cake
or
dessert
if
i
have
learned
one
thing
tomme
knows
how
to
blend
and
use
barrels
i
feel
obligated
to
revisit
the
lost
abbey
staples
that
were
flat
for
me
4
years
ago
brilliant
it
was
awkward
seeing
my
friend
have
a
moment
with
this
ale
that
was
somewhere
in
between
an
orgasm
and
a
cry
but
that
sums
up
what
this
knockout
artist
presents
to
the
table
it
shows
up
in
a
pitch
black
perfect
form
behind
a
beautifully
typical
piece
of
religious
art
work
we
expect
from
the
lost
abbey
brewing
company
the
lowest
score
it
gets
from
me
is
smell
for
while
absolutely
aromatic
it
isnt
a
blissful
overwhelming
sensation
you
feel
that
sometimes
comes
with
the
stronger
stuff
like
this
that
ranks
up
to
a
damn
near
15
abv
still
4
5
is
an
amazing
grade
from
me
and
it
is
shadowed
by
a
phenomenal
taste
finish
that
is
sweet
smoky
chocolaty
and
as
my
friend
stated
in
song
a
few
of
my
favorite
things
just
beautiful
o
excellent
beer
one
of
the
best
barrel
blends
i
have
ever
had
i
almost
regretted
buying
this
beer
because
of
the
price
tag
but
now
i
am
wishing
i
picked
up
a
couple
more
and
will
be
buying
this
any
time
i
see
it
at
a
bottle
shop
must
try
ooverall
a
great
american
strong
ale
so
glad
to
finally
get
one
overall
a
little
pricey
for
a
12
7
ounce
bottle
but
very
good
overall
worth
the
splurge
o
good
but
not
great
offering
not
enough
going
on
with
the
smell
and
the
taste
to
give
it
high
marks
overall
the
barrels
kind
of
overwhelm
the
base
beer
overall
let
us
all
enjoy
the
wonder
of
deliverance
ale
overall
worth
the
price
in
my
opinion
had
this
on
my
birthday
and
it
was
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
very
complex
and
did
i
mention
this
beer
is
reminiscent
of
bourbon
highly
recommended
o
im
not
a
big
fan
of
this
beer
its
too
expensive
and
the
barrels
play
too
big
a
roll
the
alcohol
dominates
and
depletes
any
of
the
substance
of
the
base
beers
that
being
said
however
im
super
glad
i
finally
got
to
try
it
o
a
very
well
integrated
strong
ale
the
12
5
abv
is
only
apparent
on
the
finish
everything
is
very
well
balanced
highly
recommended
a
wonderfully
delicious
barrel
aged
brew
o
complex
and
amazing
thankfully
the
bourbon
flavors
do
not
overpower
the
base
beer
if
sweeter
strongly
alcoholic
beers
are
your
thing
dont
miss
this
one
superb
oa
great
beer
from
lost
abbey
the
balance
between
the
brandy
and
the
bourbon
barrels
was
a
real
delight
overall
a
lot
like
bcbs
but
more
going
on
really
enjoy
this
beer
if
it
wasnt
so
expensive
i
would
buy
all
i
could
find
very
nice
balance
between
the
malts
and
the
blend
of
the
barrels
definitely
buy
again
14
99
for
12floz
o
taste
is
superb
is
it
worth
the
price
of
the
bottle
im
not
sure
about
that
and
im
glad
i
had
the
op
to
have
it
on
tap
first
o
i
would
definitely
buy
again
im
intrigued
by
its
complexity
and
unique
brewing
style
more
importantly
i
enjoyed
the
taste
and
would
say
it
was
worth
the
hefty
single
12
oz
bottle
price
o
the
smell
is
absolutely
amazing
but
the
taste
while
nice
falls
a
little
shy
of
all
that
the
aroma
promised
part
of
a
special
barrel
week
at
the
beer
junction
4
00
for
a
4oz
pour
listed
as
12
5
abv
deep
rich
brown
color
sweet
aroma
like
maple
syrup
flavor
was
potent
alcohol
in
your
face
it
was
a
total
palate
wrecker
viscosity
was
thinsyrupy
low
carbonation
sweet
aftertaste
there
were
particles
of
something
left
in
the
glass
not
sure
if
it
was
from
the
beer
or
the
draft
line
no
lace
left
this
was
part
of
a
4
beer
sampler
all
barrel
aged
and
i
would
say
it
came
in
4th
but
that
is
because
they
were
all
pretty
dang
good
definitely
not
bad
and
worth
a
try
o
although
it
is
very
expensive
i
would
purchase
it
again
it
is
a
good
once
and
a
while
type
beer
it
is
very
pleasant
and
has
many
of
the
qualities
that
i
enjoy
in
beers
i
know
the
expense
of
this
beer
is
a
big
deterrent
to
many
people
but
in
my
opinion
because
it
exemplifies
the
qualities
that
i
look
for
in
big
beers
good
palatability
good
taste
not
a
bad
mouthfeel
and
wonderful
complexity
that
isnt
overwhelming
i
will
certainly
be
recommending
this
beer
to
others
and
purchasing
it
again
found
last
one
on
a
shelf
at
bin
ends
in
braintree
ma
i
have
been
looking
for
this
one
for
awhile
and
it
didnt
disappoint
the
aroma
is
of
brandy
bourbon
and
vanilla
and
taste
mirrors
that
it
is
black
with
no
head
and
very
little
carbonation
this
beer
in
my
opinion
was
absolutely
perfect
in
every
way
i
seriously
loved
this
one
and
so
glad
i
finally
found
it
overall
this
is
a
wonderfully
crafted
brew
with
tons
of
flavor
and
layers
of
complexity
it
would
be
great
if
there
was
a
way
to
have
a
little
carbonation
in
some
of
the
barrel
aged
brews
that
have
no
carbonation
but
i
guess
you
cant
have
it
all
glad
i
tried
it
and
you
should
to
if
you
have
a
little
extra
coin
aged
bottle
2
years
old
black
with
minimal
head
boozy
and
warming
alcohol
presence
tasted
next
to
a
gi
bcbs
2013
and
found
many
similarities
this
had
the
brandy
notes
which
were
excellent
and
put
this
over
the
top
for
me
very
strong
showing
here
from
la
but
what
else
is
new
overall
very
tasty
overpowered
by
the
barrel
but
nice
o
decent
for
a
two
yr
vintage
bottle
wish
i
had
this
fresh
to
compare
price
is
pretty
steep
but
well
worth
it
as
this
warms
there
is
a
nice
nuttiness
coming
out
i
assume
from
the
brandy
i
get
a
similar
flavor
from
jw
lees
calvados
the
flavors
later
nicely
with
more
toffee
and
caramel
coming
out
as
well
just
awesome
12
5
percent
with
barrelage
aromas
and
flavors
almost
black
no
carbonation
a
bit
of
alcohol
in
the
taste
but
what
would
you
expect
with
12
5
both
brews
that
are
being
blended
are
very
nice
not
as
rich
as
the
belgian
dark
ales
they
produce
which
is
really
nice
i
guess
blending
is
the
big
thing
lately
with
all
the
breweries
and
this
one
doesnt
disappoint
time
for
a
return
trip
to
the
brewery
but
this
time
sober
to
start
out
deliverance
does
a
great
job
of
tampering
the
sharp
roast
of
hops
and
without
making
the
beer
overly
boozy
or
winy
it
delivers
the
perfect
balance
while
allowing
the
stout
to
lead
the
charge
supple
refined
and
astoundingly
complex
this
ale
is
best
reserved
for
the
most
discerning
of
palates
cheers
a
drinkable
well
perhaps
not
but
ones
plenty
overall
very
impressive
with
booze
hidden
nicely
from
the
aging
process
easily
would
buy
again
succumb
to
the
madness
pray
for
your
deliverance
from
this
hellish
temptress
othis
is
a
tasty
almoststout
like
ale
i
really
enjoyed
the
bourbonbrandy
character
here
as
it
was
assertive
and
complex
without
being
overwhelming
you
can
really
taste
the
booze
but
you
know
you
are
drinking
a
beer
the
feel
was
a
little
strange
but
not
entirely
awful
with
a
sweet
and
boozy
flavor
this
is
a
solid
dessert
option
overall
one
tasty
barrel
aged
brew
all
the
notes
shine
individually
and
really
dig
the
chocolate
covers
dark
fruit
and
brandy
notes
but
the
oak
and
vanilla
make
this
brew
shine
stand
out
and
i
really
enjoy
it
some
people
have
complained
about
carb
issues
on
this
but
ive
had
none
wow
just
phenomenal
so
glad
i
tried
it
and
cant
wait
until
i
do
it
again
o
overall
a
great
beer
from
top
to
bottom
the
highlight
is
the
aroma
which
is
divine
full
disclosure
im
kind
of
a
whore
for
big
booze
beers
especially
when
aged
in
barrels
but
i
did
really
dig
this
one
o
very
dark
and
boozy
and
as
someone
who
likes
bourbon
enjoyed
it
delicious
and
easy
to
drink
despite
the
alcohol
content
overpriced
in
my
opinion
at
17
but
a
very
good
beer
nonetheless
overall
remains
me
a
little
of
firestone
walker
anniversary
xvi
but
i
think
this
is
more
balanced
a
very
complex
and
interesting
beer
but
with
a
steep
pricetag
15
for
375ml
overall
good
stuff
but
the
lack
of
carbonation
in
my
bottle
really
held
things
back
deliverance
pours
a
almost
blackish
color
with
a
small
head
there
is
a
brandy
like
barrel
like
spicy
malty
aroma
the
taste
has
nice
strong
wood
and
smokey
notes
malty
with
hints
of
a
dark
wine
like
flavors
very
nice
complete
body
overall
an
awesome
beer
bottle
poured
a
dark
cloudy
brown
color
ale
with
a
large
foamy
head
with
good
carbonation
and
some
lacing
aroma
consists
of
bourbon
with
residual
sugar
notes
and
caramelized
sugars
taste
is
also
dominated
by
bourbon
notes
with
some
caramelized
malt
and
quite
a
lot
of
residual
sugars
some
dried
fruits
and
light
chocolate
notes
are
also
perceptible
body
is
full
with
great
carbonation
and
surprisingly
no
apparent
alcohol
nice
nightcap
style
beer
i
imagine
this
could
be
an
incredible
beer
if
it
actually
had
carbonation
in
it
lesson
learned
do
not
spend
money
on
flat
lost
abbey
bottles
very
interesting
will
try
it
again
despite
the
price
tag
o
a
stellar
blend
i
like
some
strong
ales
this
isnt
one
of
em
i
couldnt
even
finish
the
glass
i
poured
and
im
sorry
about
that
big
disappointment
pours
a
black
color
almost
like
a
stout
no
head
to
speak
of
and
really
no
carbonation
either
bourbon
is
very
strong
from
the
getgo
smell
and
taste
almost
drinks
like
a
glass
of
liquor
not
beer
i
wasnt
terribly
impressed
with
this
beer
mainly
because
the
bourbon
taste
overwhelms
any
other
beer
taste
on
this
one
overall
a
massive
beer
with
tons
of
barrel
influence
nice
to
find
an
appropriate
amount
of
carbonation
though
that
should
never
be
a
welcomed
surprise
overall
ive
always
wanted
to
try
some
of
the
harder
to
obtain
lost
abbey
products
and
im
glad
paid
the
high
price
tag
for
this
one
a
unique
strong
ale
that
has
some
very
good
barrel
accents
the
body
is
a
little
thin
and
some
of
the
flavor
get
a
little
lost
375ml
bottle
that
i
only
bought
because
i
found
it
for
11
i
feel
bad
for
anyone
who
paid
17
because
this
beer
is
way
overpriced
black
color
a
decent
head
it
was
not
completely
flat
aroma
was
a
bit
of
booze
and
malt
meh
flavor
was
barrel
and
grapes
i
mostly
tasted
the
angels
share
because
i
kept
thinking
of
cognac
decent
beer
but
ridiculously
overpriced
even
at
11
booo
odelicious
really
enjoyed
sipping
this
one
the
blend
seems
to
work
well
im
glad
i
finally
got
to
try
and
review
this
beer
i
felt
a
little
disappointed
just
because
i
dint
think
it
was
spectacular

people
theres
no

i

of
this
on

i
would
honestly
suggest
sitting
on
this
for
some
time
to
let
the
heat
drop
a
bit
the
stout
bourbon
and
brandy
notes
are
really
one
of
a
kind
here
given
the

i
have
no

with

this

this

had

going

here
with
just
a
hint
of
bitterness
to
help
bring
it
all
together
still
pretty
boozy

could
see
this

d

and
very
thick
definitely
a
sipper
the
beer
is
lightly
carbonated
fitting
for
the
strong
flavors
and
thick
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
this
one
is
definitely
a
sipper
as
the
alcohol
is
evident
early
and
often
but
its
expected
and
welcome
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
certainly
wouldnt
turn
down
another
bottle
if
it
came
my
way
in
the
end
setting
all
my
gripes
with
lost
abbey
aside
i
think
this
is
a
great
beer
when
looked
at
on
the
larger
scale
but
when
comparing
it
to
other
small
specialty
crafted
barrel
aged
beers
it
does
not
quite
deliver
on
the
same
level
as
comparable
ones
deliverance
is
smooth
yet
sticky
with
a
high
carbonation
for
an
ale
this
strong
the
light
carbonation
does
not
hurt
this
beer
whatsoever
it
seems
to
fit
this
sipper
perfectly
this
one
is
super
thick
and
viscous
on
the
palate
with
a
warming
alcoholic
aftereffect
the

is
not
as
evident
in
the
taste
as
it
is
in
my
flushed
cheeks
as
i
finish
this
glass
for
as
heavy
as
a
beer
this
is
the
drinkability
is
superb
i
enjoyed
this
one
until
the
very
last
drop
was
gone
d
you
certainly
feel
the
alcohol
but
very
tasty
and
a
great
blend
drinkability
is
great
at
12
5
abv
this
is
a
sipper
but
a
delicious
one
alcohol
is
warming
but
does
not
get
in
the
way
of
the
flavor
an
excellent
after
dinner
drink
to
enjoy
by
the
fire
on
a
cold
night
i
think
i
enjoy
this
more
than
the
regular
brandy
angels
share
but
ive
never
had
the
bourbon
serpents
stout
so
i
cant
comment
on
that
the
only
downside
to
this
beer
is
the
price
at
1718
in
ma
i
probably
wont
be
buying
too
many
of
these
but
i
would
still
recommend
trying
a
bottle
because
it
is
a
well
crafted
brew
overall
i
could
really
appreciate
this
as
an
aprèsski
or
after
a
long
day
of
work
by
the
fire
in
the
wintertime
very
yummy
overall
a
very
nice
barrel
aged
beer
well
this
is
a
very
good
beer
but
theres
an
oomph
missing
that
keeps
it
from
reaching
the
panorama
of
really
excellent
brews
light
on
the
complexity
this
one
uses
the
barrels
to
carry
it
deep
brown
hue
bordering
on
black
with
a
good
sized
beige
head
that
leaves
a
healthy
amount
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
brandy
alcohol
and
roasted
malt
the
taste
follows
suit
the
feel
is
medium
to
thick
in
body
with
a
very
strong
alcohol
presence
most
notably
brandy
this
is
a
very
tasty
beer
and
definitely
worthwhile
great
for
sharing
a
few
ways
as
this
is
best
in
small
doses
it
pops
it
pours
a
loud
brown
slight
brown
shade
of
head
this
was
poured
to
loud
cheers
squawks
and
scrambling

decadence

for

it

pleasures

but
it
is
their
whim
not
yours
and
so
your

is
now
empty
short
poured
from
a
375

bottle
into
my

goblet
a
little

enough
to

the

a

drinkability

its
pretty
boozy
and
thick
and
chewy
a
bit
of
a
sticky
sweetness
on
the
finish
as
well
but
smooth
and
delicious
i
think
ill
get
a
couple
bottles
and
leave
them
in
the
cellar
for
a
while
frankly
deliverance
is
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
from
lost
abbey
in
a
few
years
isabelle
not
withstanding
this
small
bottle
is
perfect
for
splitting
with
a
good
buddy
on
a
cold
night
and
i
hope
this
gets
made
again
d
a
well
composed
blend
that
will
likely
benefit
from
a
cellared
vacation
really
robust
intense
flavors
here
so
if
that
is
your
thing
go
right
ahead
but
many
might
be
turned
off
by
the
alcohol

as
it
starts
this
beer
is

tomme
continues
to
make
some
of
the
best
barrel
aged
beers
around
just
wish
there
was
more
of
this
produced
because
i
bet
this
beer
will
age
with
the
best
of
them
carbonation
is
low
but
there
and
doesnt
hurt
the
beer
one
bit
booze
is
high
and
drinkability
is
surprisingly
high
for
such

and
i
could

love
it

i

it

bourbon
is
one
of
my

favorite
brews
and
i

i
was

expecting
deliverance
to
be
like
it
but
its
not
quite
on
the

definitely
delicious
but
the
heat
from
this
one
is
much
more

when

of

real
arrogance
in
charging
20
for
a
12oz
bottle
of
this
who
do
lost
abbey
think
theyre
fooling
this
beer
is
ridiculously
overpriced
for
how
little
complexity
it
has
ultimately
its
pretty
good
but
feels
incomplete
and
underdone
this
is
why
i
rarely
buy
tommes
limited
releases
delicious
the
whole
way
through
much
more
drinkable
than
my
normal
bourbon
beers
really
great
beer
for
my
first
lost
abbey
tasting
drinkabilityits
a
good
sipper
but
its
got
some
harsh
notes
that
will
probably
do
well
with
some
age
on
it
search
this
one
out
if
you
like
a
rich
and
flavorful
brew
good
carbonation
which
is
an
unexpected
treat
in
a
lost
abbey
beer
very
well
done
all
around
now
they
just
have
to
reduce
their
costs
thanks
to
otakuale
for
the
trade
pours
dark
brown
with
plenty
of
carbonation
smells
a
lot
like
angels
share
loads
of
bourbon
vanilla
fruit
spice
tastes
quite
good
bourbon
caramel
vanilla
fruit
a
sweet
malt
bomb
tons
of
alcohol
is
present
in
the
flavor
and
its
really
hot
about
as
conspicuous
a
burning
hot
alcohol
beer
as
i
can
recall
having
had
that
said
this
is
a
nice
sipper
and
is
easily
shared
with
a
friend
despite
being
only
375
ml
body
is
on
the
thick
side
with
medium
carbonation
appropriate
for
the
style
overall
i
like
this
beer
but
for
the
price
and
given
the
alcohol
heat
one
is
enough
for
me
d
very
very
good
not
sure
i
would
pay
the
freight
on
this
again
but
it
was
worth
trying
once
for
sure
drinkability
i
was
glad
i
split
this
one
with
someone
glad
it
was
only
375ml
the
pours
a
deep
blackness
topped
by
a
decent
amount
of
tan
foam
the
nose
comprises
of
most
things
heavy
there
is
some
coffee
chocolate
whiskey
brandy
and
oak
along
with
various
other
sweet
fruits
that
are
hard
to
pick
out
amongst
the
myriad
of
aromas
present
the
flavor
is
wonderful
it
tastes
up
front
as
if
there
is
a
very
cherrywhiskeysyrupy
flavor
that
is
masked
due
to
the
smoothness
of
the
beer
all
of
the
sudden
after
you
have
finished
with
the
mouthful
bam
you
are
hit
with
the
woody
oak
flavor
that
is
quite
unparalleled
it
is
a
deep
rich
flavor
but
a
bit
on
the
strong
and
boozy
side
its
really
a
delicious
beer
and
a
heavy
recommendation
for
anyone
willing
to
shell
out
the
cash
required
to
purchase
one
of
these
bad
boys
grabbed
this
today
at
bermans
in
lexington
very
cool
artwork
of
angels
and
demons
fighting
over
somebody
the
color
is
almost
completely
black
with
just
a
small
amount
of
lacing
as
far
as
the
head
goes
the
nose
is
of
molten
chocolate
cake
molasses
and
naturally
brandy
and
bourbon
wow
the
alcohol
is
very
present
in
the
taste
giving
it
the
feel
of
a
spirit
very
similar
to
the
nose
but
there
are
some
underlying
fruit
notes
that
makes
it
all
the
more
interesting
despite
the
heat
from
the
alcohol
the
mouthfeel
is
not
especially
huge
more
in
the
middle
i
would
say
the
carbonation
is
also
kept
in
check
well
like
enjoying
a
spirit
neat
or
on
the
rocks
this
is
one
to
sip
slowly
and
let
develop
as
it
warms
to
room
temperature
although
grossly
overpriced
this
is
another
quality
brew
from
lost
abbey
i
would
be
interested
in
trying
the
bourbon
barrel
aged
serpent
stout
which
is
one
of
the
brews
along
with
brandy
angels
share
blended
in
here
cheers
glad
to
see
this
made
a
wider
distribution
than
i
originally
had
thought
it
pours
a
deathly
black
topped
by
about
threequarters
of
a
finger
of
light
tan
foam
the
nose
comprises
molasses
chocolate
syrup
brown
sugar
cinnamon
oak
whiskey
vanilla
and
maple
syrup
the
taste
leads
with
all
of
those
lovely
dark
notes
similarly
to
a
rich
imperial
stout
but
then
a
secondary
wave
of
whiskeyinfused
oak
crisscrosses
the
tongue
colliding
with
the
original
flavor
inhabitants
its
quite
an
experience
and
an
altogether
pleasant
one
at
that
the
body
is
quite
hefty
with
a
light
carbonation
and
a
syrupy
almost
chewy
feel
honestly
if
it
were
a
bit
thickerheavier
this
would
have
been
perfect
i
think
overall
a
very
tasty
cuvee
one
that
finally
lives
up
to
the
usual
lost
abbey
hype
machine
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
good
carbonation
not
overly
heavy
and
goes
down
smooth
considering
the
high
gravity
here
overall
this
ranks
up
there
as
one
of
my
favorite
lost
abbey
releases
the
melding
of
bourbon
and
brandy
is
quite
nice
all
in
all
this
is
a
good
brew
not
great
i
am
kind
of
disappointed
by
la
by
this
one
as
i
had
higher
hopes
for
it
guess
i
set
the
bar
a
little
too
high
great
to
try
at
least
once
if
you
like
big
beers
as
i
am
a
big
beer
lover
but
dont
expect
to
be
floored
by
this
one
drinkability
a
sipper
for
sure
i
was
at
the
bar
for
quite
a
while
with
just
an
8oz
pour
and
it
was
somewhat
of
a
chore
to
finish
i
did
go
in
at
an
odd
time
2pm
to
avoid
the
hustle
and
bustle
so
i
could
be
sure
i
would
be
able
to
enjoy
my
beer
without
feeling
pressured
to
finish
it
up
quick
and
either
order
another
or
leave
it
was
a
bit
hot
for
me
and
i
could
defiantly
smell
alcohol
in
the
nose
and
taste
it
i
have
two
of
these
in
my
cellar
right
now
and
dont
think
i
will
revisit
them
for
about
a
year
and
have
it
as
a
night
cap
on
a
cold
night
overall
a
very
interesting
beer
and
was
glad
i
was
able
to
try
it
now
so
i
can
see
how
it
ages
later
chocolate
caramel
candy
is
again
prevalent
on
the
palate
quite
a
bit
of
brash
alcohol
too
but
i
dont
mind
dark
fruit
appears
midpalate
and
theres
just
enough
tannic
oak
to
balance
the
sweetness
the
flavors
lean
toward
angels
share
but
theres
a
touch
more
chocolate
roast
and
dark
fruit
its
great
fresh
but
it
should
be
excellent
in
a
few
months
when
some
of
the
harshness
fades
what
a
treat
too
bad
its
14
99
for
a
375
ml
bottle
i
guess
ill
have
to
wait
to
find
it
ontap
to
sample
again
beer
is
medium
bodied
and
sweet
with
mild
roast
at
the
back
the
liquor
components
in
the
mouth
are
there
but
it
was
much
more
obvious
in
the
nose
than
the
palate
beer
seems
mildly
hot
drinkability
is
still
quite
good
and
i
would
recommend
it
and
try
it
again
especially
after
a
year
the
beer
pours
stout
black
given
that
angels
share
was
pretty
dark
in
its
own
right
and
it
was
blended
with
a
stout
this
isnt
surprising
with
about
a
finger
of
caramel
colored
head
rising
up
the
foamy
cap
lingers
for
just
a
second
before
dissipating
not
bad
for
such
a
big
beer
but
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
either
the
nose
hints
that
this
beer
is
going
to
be
an
absolute
chocolate
bomb
fine
by
me
even
more
so
than
that
though
is
the
smell
of
bourbon
and
just
a
hint
of
brandy
the
nose
is
decent
but
a
little
too
alcohol
dominant
i
find
more
balance
in
deliverance
as
i
sip
on
it
the
booze
is
definitely
still
there
but
the
rich
roasty
chocolate
really
asserts
itself
here
especially
as
the
beer
warms
and
mellows
out
a
little
bit
the
chocolate
becomes
the
main
attraction
its
also
a
pretty
thick
beer
and
overall
id
say
it
reminds
me
of
goose
island
bcs
just
a
rich
viscous
chocolate
and
bourbon
milkshake
although
with
a
splash
of
brandy
this
time
around
i
cant
say
deliverance
is
flat
like
my
last
lost
abbey
beer
was
but
its
only
just
barely
carbonated
a
beer
this
big
and
rich
shouldnt
have
explosive
carbonation
but
it
shouldnt
be
something
i
have
to
strain
this
hard
to
find
either
deliverance
is
surely
a
sipper
as
while
i
emphasized
the
chocolate
when
discussing
the
flavor
alcohol
is
definitely
present
as
well
it
works
out
to
the
drinkers
advantage
though
as
i
find
deliverance
to
only
improve
as
it
warms
up
now
if
lost
abbey
could
just
get
these
beers
properly
carbonated
ive
had
nothing
but
bad
luck
with
lost
abbeys
the
angels
share
both
bourbon
and
brandy
aged
so
this
beer
was
both
a
relief
and
a
revelation
d
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
very
good
beer
i
didnt
like
it
quite
as
much
as
the
as
grand
cru
but
it
was
much
better
than
the
as
brandy
and
bourbon
barrel
bottles
i
have
had
i
really
thought
the
nose
and
taste
were
complex
and
balanced
i
liked
the
nose
a
little
more
than
the
taste
but
both
were
great
would
love
to
try
again
d
a
must
try
for
me
i
liked
it
but
im
glad
i
didnt
pony
up
the
15
for
the
bottle
much
cheaper
on
draft
its
good
but
not
that
good
poured
into
a
new
belgium
snifter
color
is
opaque
blackvery
dark
brown
with
a
thin
mocha
head
that
fades
to
the
outer
edge
looks
identical
to
angels
share
but
with
carbonation
smell
is
bourbon
off
the
bat
followed
by
lots
of
brandy
no
surprise
there
but
it
is
nice
lots
of
alcohol
heat
and
a
tiny
bit
of
chocolate
taste
is
a
great
blend
of
the
brandy
and
bourbon
with
a
strong
hot
finish
slightly
bitter
lasting
flavor
is
of
milk
chocolate
mouthfeel
is
very
light
carbonation
and
a
heavy
coating
feel
for
the
style
it
is
appropriate
but
just
barely
fizzy
drinkability
is
low
for
this
one
due
to
the
abv
its
very
filling
the
complex
malt
and
barrel
flavors
keep
me
wanting
more
though
pours
a
dark
chestnut
brown
with
a
tan
head
small
amounts
of
lacing
but
certainly
respectable
for
a
beer
of
this
heft
smell
brings
a
lot
with
brandy
bourbon
roasted
malt
alcohol
dark
fruits
and
candied
sugars
all
playing
a
role
taste
is
quite
similar
although
everything
isnt
quite
as
integrated
in
that
respect
and
the
alcohol
heat
plays
a
bigger
role
which
degrades
a
bit
from
the
mouthfeel
drinkability
is
very
nice
as
this
is
quite
complex
i
think
age
will
absolutely
do
wonders
to
this
one
overall
this
was
one
of
the
thinnest
ba
beers
ive
had
in
a
while
the
flavors
were
all
there
but
just
werent
substantial
enough
to
stand
up
to
the
barrel
influences
still
its
worth
a
shot
to
see
for
yourself
in
comparison
makes
bourbon
angels
share
seem
very
one
dimensional
angels
share
is
much
sweeter
the
beer
is
just
too
hot
if
something
is
uber
compex
you
can
get
away
with
this
much
heat
sometimes
but
this
is
a
pretty
onenote
sweetbourbon
blast
of
a
beer
i
think
a
lot
of
the
nuances
are
being
blasted
into
bolivia
notes
of
vanilla
chocolate
smoke
caramel
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
had
from
lost
abbey
hands
down
this
is
what
i
have
been
waiting
for
them
to
put
out
amazing
thanks
to
ratman
for
sharing
this
one
last
night
it
followed
a
few
other
barleywines
and
blew
them
away
poured
a
deep
rich
mahogany
color
shot
through
with
red
with
a
good
12
inch
of
light
brown
foam
huge
aromas
of
brandy
red
and
black
grapes
raisins
and
booze
on
the
palate
i
get
a
little
roastiness
from
the
stout
oak
caramel
toffee
and
dark
fruits
i
didnt
pick
up
any
bourbon
but
this
one
got
hot
as
it
warmed
an
excellent
beer
very
grateful
i
got
to
try
it
drinkability
im
glad
this
isnt
in
the
750ml
format
the
375
will
do
the
job
nicely
sip
sippin
away
overall
this
was
a
nice
beer
the
roastiness
provided
by
the
serpents
stout
helped
to
balance
the
sweetness
of
the
angels
share
an
epic
brew
i
only
get
a
touch
of
heat
and
alcohol
and
mostly
in
the
nose
as
the
beer
warms
its
12
5
though
and
i
like
to
be
reminded
that
what
im
drinking
is
strong
im
sure
a
year
or
two
of
age
will
make
this
dangerously
drinkable
though

is

but
reading
the
reviews
by
reviewers
that
obviously
thought
they
were
buying
a
different
style
of
beer
pissed
me
off
i
bought
this
beer
because
i
wanted
a
sweet
sticky
strong
drink
just
like
this
i
was
a
treat
cheers
du
claw
thank
you
very
good
with
a
nice
boozy
taste
tasted
like
apple
pie
moonshine
for
me
not
bad
love
the
abv
and
was
happy
to
try
it
this
was
an
aged
2011
vintage
one
dimensional
too
sweet
taste
is
grimaceinducingly
strong
with
the
malts
not
enough
to
cover
for
the
massive
wave
of
alcohol
not
enough
hops
to
provide
a
bitter
clean
finish
either
there
are
better
huge
beers
out
there
but
most
of
those
tend
to
fall
in
the
stout
category
where
the
alcohol
can
be
balanced
by
a
heavy
malt
load
its
an
interesting
beer
to
try
i
can
finish
my
bottle
and
would
like
to
see
what
a
3
or
4
year
old
vintage
would
taste
like
but
i
wont
go
searching
for
this
too
boozy
o
this
is
like
drinking
gasoline
with
a
ton
of
sugar
added
its
absolutely
awful
overall
it
is
a
very
poorly
done
beer
and
not
one
that
i
will
be
trying
again
its
a
lot
like
drinking
a
very
flavorful
malt
tree
sap
but
in
a
way
kind
of
fun
doesnt
really
have
much
wow
appeal
more
of
a
go
for
broke
sense
regardless
it
is
still
enjoyable
overall
i
was
actually
quite
surprised
i
was
expecting
something
a
bit
boozier
in
nature
but
the
sweetness
and
doughtiness
of
the
beer
really
nicely
balanced
the
rummy
booziness
of
the
beer
and
made
it
very
palatable
for
such
a
big
beer
this
one
was
rather
well
done
2
795
rather
unsophisticated
but
if
you
enjoy
mixing
apple
cider
with
fireball
youll
probably
love
this
full
velvety
smooth
body
drinks
like
a
scotch
on
the
rocks
slight
tempered
burn
this
is
extreme
beer
gone
extremely
right
overall
well
ive
had
few
as
big
as
this
one
it
drinks
almost
like
a
barleywine
aside
from
dfhs
18
nonsense
ive
not
experienced
anything
quite
like
this
i
bet
this
would
age
well
and
the
alcohol
end
up
less
pronounced
it
felt
lucky
to
try
it
but
you
wont
see
my
buying
another
unless
the
jack
it
back
up
to
20

o
overall
this
is
a
nice

beerand
probably
the
nicest
extreme
beer
i
have
had
the
alcohol

its
not
overpowering
or
annoyingit
is
also
much
more
present
in
the
nose
and
mouthfeel
than
it
is
in
the
actual
flavor
interesting
beer
score
is
for
how
much
the
flavor
seems
to
develop
over
the
course
of
the

a
sipping

at
best
beer
advocate
has
the
wrong
abv
the
bottle
i
drank

17

not

92
this
is
really
just
a
mess
of
a
beer
too
many
high
fermentable
sugars
results
in
a
thin
bubbly
boozy
brew
with
little
identity
lots
of
cider
notes
astringency
and
fusels
for
the
price
it

certainly
are
better

ale
out
there
i
have
another
bottle
so
might
revisit
it
and
revise
this
if
i
have
even
a
slightly
better
experience
but
as
of
now
this
was
a
drain
pour
for
me
overall
its
well
worth
trying
i
would
obviously
recommend
it
to
those
who
enjoy
high
alcohol
beers
but
namely
belgian
ones
with
a
bit
of
fruity
and
spicy
character
to
them
you
will
get
enough
flavor
out
of
the
beer
that
it
wont
end
up
tasting
like
pure
alcohol
i
definitely
recommend
having
some
food
nearby
especially
crackers
or
pretzels
to
refresh
the
palate
after
taking
a
sip
or
two
d
even
a
little
bit
is
too
much
o
overall
i
like
it
its
tasty
and
just
a
pleasant
beer
to
drink
im
sharing
the
bottle
with
my
sons
because
i
think
it
would
be
a
mistake
to
try
to
kill
it
alone
enjoyable
but
not
for
you
if
you
dont
like
sweetness
5
overall
this
is
an
amazing
beer
i
have
never
had
anything
like
it
the
consensus
is
barleywine
but
it
is
much
fruitier
than
any
barleywine
i
have
ever
had
another
ba
at
the
tasting
ucsbmullet
commented
that
he
thought
it
had
some
age
he
guessed
about
two
years
my
first
guess
was
a
vintage
big
bottle
of
dfh
olde
school
barleywine
but
the
bottle
isnt
the
right
shape
and
it
had
an
unbranded
cap
so
i
am
going
with
my
first
instinct
which
is
the
only
15
beer
from
md
where
oline73
is
from
and
that
is
duclaw
colossus
m
its
full
but
a
thinner
full
bodied
brew
o
im
struggling
to
drink
this
glass
way
too
sweet
impressive
and
not
what
i
was
expecting
but
i
dont
know
what
i
was
expecting
sweet
but
not
malty
almost
like
mead
d
this
was
a
very
nicely
brewed
beer
given
the
alcohol
level
scent
and
taste
werent
too
over
the
top
but
the
body
was
like
sludge
and
the
alcohol
was
obvious
so
it
must
be
sipped
could
probably
age
forever
but
nice
now
bold
and
complex
and
great
to
contemplate
recommended
m
full
bodied
bit
creamy
definitely
got
a
nice
heat
to
it
nothing
near
what
a
20
beer
should
be
though
this
is
insanely
drinkable
like
holy
shit
if
im
not
careful
im
gonna
be
on
my
face
drunk
not
as
syrupy
as
a
huge
stout
or
barleywine
so
the
heat
doesnt
hide
as
well
but
ive
had
hotter
910
beers
than
this
flavors
are
sticky
but
not
too
long
lasting
very
well
put
together
and
it
doesnt
have
anything
disjointed
i
can
complain
about
since
i
have
a
sweet
tooth
i
was
dying
to
try
this
and
glad
i
splurged
30
bones
live
a
little
poured
a
reddish
copper
with
small
head
that
died
quick
and
left
tiny
lace
running
down
my
snifter
a
boozy
aroma
of
malts
as
i
pick
up
hints
of
roasted
but
mostly
some
caramel
syrupmolasses
andor
sugary
goodness
cinnamom
and
spicy
pepper
and
a
touch
of
chocolate
and
for
some
reason
im
getting
a
touch
of
fruit
like
cherry
the
label
says
apple
but
it
smellstaste
like
cherry
to
me
taste
is
more
of
the
same
as
this
is
an
intense
brew
yet
for
all
its
thick
sticky
syrupy
malty
goodness
i
feel
that
it
is
surprisingly
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
real
sweet
as
the
caramel
cinnamon
touches
of
chocolate
and
cherrylike
fruit
although
w
label
saying
apple
one
could
say
this
beer
resembles
a
strong
apple
brandy
but
also
a
dry
edge
as
the
spices
and
cinnnamon
come
into
play
i
also
get
a
minor
citrusy
hop
bite
on
the
backend
which
gives
the
slightly
boozy
and
warming
finish
a
little
crisp
snap
this
beer
was
great
to
sip
on
and
it
took
me
a
long
time
to
sip
and
i
think
i
had
a
minor
buzz
but
it
was
worth
the
price
as
the
sweetness
doesnt
get
grating
and
kept
going
down
easy
and
the
warming
enhanced
the
sweetness
but
the
beer
doesnt
get
too
boozy
d
split
a
22
with
at
least
4
friends
and
youll
be
good
any
more
and
your
done
son
medium
mouthfeel
and
low
carbonation
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
thanks
dyan
for
the
hookup
im
going
to
be
sipping
this
one
for
a
couple
of
hours
either
that
or
be
asleep
someplace
between
here
bed
damn
good
beer
that
could
easily
be
split
4
or
5
ways
22

no

sweet

aroma
very
sweet
flavors
of
raisins
toffee
caramel
some
faint
candied
sugar
amazingly
the
alcohol
is
not
overpowering
but
it
has
quite
the
warming
property
to
it
a
definite
sipper
very
sweet
almost
like
a
mead
or
aptiff
great
after
dinner
drink
but
you
arent
gonna
drink
too
much
of
this
i
think
it
will
age
well
well
see
long
sweet
finish
overall
really
smooth
considering
the
abv
i
think
this
one
was
better
than
the
last
batch
o
really
nice
beer
by
duclaw
and
totally
lives
up
to
its
name
this
is
a
beer
to
be
sipped
savored
respected
and
probably
shared
i
enjoyed
this
one
and
if
you
like
big
bold
beers
you
will
too
just
remember
the
abv
or
you
might
end
up
on
the
floor
poured
a
deep
dark
brown
with
a
big
head
that
fadeed
to
nothing
some
nice
lace
down
the
glass
lots
of
activity
left
in
the
film
on
top
looks
good
smell
was
so
complex
it
is
even
hard
to
describe
everytime
you
went
near
it
you
smelled
something
different
bready
tones
the
first
time
spiceness
the
second
alchol
some
fruitness
a
bit
of
the
hops
it
offeres
a
variety
in
every
sense
of
the
word
the
taste
is
big
thick
full
of
alcohol
which
is
not
even
remotely
hidden
here
lots
of
dark
fruits
and
berries
can
be
found
in
here
if
you
look
grassy
tones
apricot
pear
very
complex
and
lots
of
flavors
seem
to
be
battling
each
other
almost
tastes
like
a
cross
between
an
american
and
belgian
strong
due
to
al
the
complex
things
going
on
in
here
o
really
nice
to
be
honest
i
had
never
had
any
desire
to
try
this
beer
due
to
its
price
and
its
gimmicky
nature
however
im
glad
i
did
this
is
twice
as
good
as
dfhs
high
octane
brews
such
as
world
wide
stout
raison
dextra
and
olde
school
for
starters
beer
is
thin
and
super
sweet
reminds
me
of
apple
brandy
shockingly
not
boozy
very
sweet
not
bitter
mildly
dry
finish
id
wager
to
say
id
have
this
again
illogical
very
smooth
for
a
beer
of
this
strength
shocking
really
an
interesting
beer
but
it
took
me
over
a
half
hour
just
to
drink
my
6
ounce
serving
my
cheeks
were
starting
to
warm
half
way
through
in
small
portions
this
would
make
a
nice
after
dinner
drink
or
liquer
not
sure
what
i
would
ever
do
with
an
entire
bomber
of
this
stuff
o
this
is
a
sipping
beer
21
alcohol
by
volume
it
is
strong
and
robust
and
amazing
wow
that
is
all
i
can
say
this
is
a
full
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
for
the
huge
abv
it
was
very
approachable
and
i
would
certainly
drink
it
again
during
the
tasting
of
this
brew
deuane
made
the
comment
that
this
tastes
like
the
beer
version
of
boilo
honestly
i
cant
disagree
with
that
spot
on
with
that
comment
deuane
thanks
again
for
sharing
had
on
tap
at
an
oktoberfest
event
in
md
wow
pours
mahogany
with
a
small
tan
head
aroma
is
of
fruit
honey
wheat
and
spice
there
is
not
much
alcohol
in
the
aroma
which
is
surprising
taste
is
of
very
dry
honey
dark
fruit
especially
raisins
and
wheat
lingering
taste
of
sugary
dark
fruit
the
alcohol
is
well
masked
but
you
definitely
know
it
is
there
it
doesnt
creep
up
on
you
in
facerapes
you
for
the
entire
beer
mouthfeel
is
sticky
but
drinks
easy
the
drinkability
given
the
amount
of
alcohol
is
frightening
sticky
sweet
fruit
cocktail
of
plum
pear
and
apple
malt
nope
syrupy
body
and
rather
sweet
which
effectively
masks
the
alcohol
surprisingly
drinkable
a
22
booze
bomb
is
the
perfect
way
to
end
a
night
just
be
sure
to
split
the
bottle

thanks
joe
a
whopper
of
a
beer
this
is
the
biggest
ive
had
from
duclaws
and
undeniably
huge
pours
an
attractive
marmalade
brown
color
with
a
thin
orange
tan
head
smell
is
like
marmalade
as
well
taste
starts
out
like
marmalade
but
breaks
down
into
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
and
cloves
finally
goin
to
a
thin
trace
of
malts
considering
the
strength
it
has
this
beer
is
a
rather
gentle
giant
not
revealing
its
huge
abv
in
its
taste
i
barely
noticed
any
burn
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
is
almost
scary
but
luckily
its
huge
price
and
low
availability
inhibits
drinking
alot
of
it
good
work
duclaw
im
proud
of
you
colossus
has
been
according
to
the
duclaw
website
verified
by
the
siebel
institute
to
21
abv
hard
to
believe
and
yet
i
buy
it
i
would
buy
it
too
if
i
could
the
cleanest
most
devilishly
smooth
ultrahigh
abv
beer
ive
had
to
date
colossus
is
also
the
tastiest
20
beer
ive
had
thats
not
called
utopias
drinkabilitythis
is
an
amazingly
drinkable
well
balanced
high
abv
beer
yikes
not
what
i
expected
at
all
tastes
like
corn
syrup
with
maple
flavor
added
if
aunt
jemima
brewed
a
beer
i
imagine
this
is
what
i
think
it
would
taste
like
the
beer
has
good
carbonation
and
a
nice
look
to
it
but
there
is
way
too
much
unfermented
sugar
left
in
this
beast
the
reason
the
alcohol
is
hidden
so
well
is
because
of
the
sugar
i
dont
have
a
problem
with
sweet
beers
either
this
one
just
missed
the
mark
for
me
pours
a
medium
redamber
color
with
a
decent
amount
of
carb
i
wasnt
really
expecting
much
smells
are
sweet
malts
slight
apple
some
clove
and
other
spices
bam
this
beer
is
awesome
liquid
french
toast
in
an
extremly
good
way
i
was
not
expecting
it
to
be
this
damn
good
theres
some
cinnamon
vanilla
a
lot
going
on
here
mouthfeel
is
chewy
very
pleasant
the
drinkability
is
incredibly
surprising
given
the
abv
of
this
beast
i
think
this
beer
might
have
been
the
show
stealer
at
our
tasting
as
no
one
knew
what
to
expect
so
good
d
this
beer
despite
being
such
a
huge
abv
is
very
drinkable
i
think
this
beer
is
flying
under
the
radar
so
you
should
seek
out
pronto
before
it
blows
up
i
know
ill
be
looking
out
for
some
more
soon
d
the
alcohol
is
exceptionally
hidden
to
the
end
that
i
would
guess
this
to
be
a
12
abv
beer
in
a
blind
tasting
this
makes
for
a
fantastic
dessert
beer
andor
nightcap
d
not
really
drinkable
nice
flavors
but
too
much
of
everything
just
never
really
comes
together
the
drowsiness
is
catching
up
to
me
and
without
the
music
i
had
earlier
i
cant
think
of
a
good
leadin
for
this
brew
dammit
well
lets
go
this
route
i
bought
this
bottle
based
on
the
intriguing
description
on
the
label
and
the
strangely
high
abv
and
equally
high
price
tag
now
im
not
sure
what
an
epic
beer
ought
to
look
like
but
this
one
does
not
appear
all
that
impressive
a
surprisingly
clear
garnet
with
a
minimal
amount
of
fuzzy
head
impressive
nope
but
pretty
nonetheless
the
smell
on
the
other
hand
comes
across
exactly
according
to
expectations
heavy
alcohol
tones
bordering
on
the
kind
of
antiseptic
you
are
bombarded
by
during
every
visit
to
a
hospital
or
old
folks
home
oershadowing
some
sugary
maple
honey
and
cherry
highlights
you
can
definitely
tell
this
guys
gonna
hurt
ya
not
quite
surprisingly
yes
theres
still
a
kick
o
the
hol
but
its
not
as
bad
as
expected
instead
the
honey
cherry
sour
apple
and
maple
flavors
come
through
in
a
big
way
creating
some
sort
of
syrup
combo
cough
and
pancake
that
strains
the
buds
to
their
very
limits
im
stuck
between
opposing
positions
here
im
not
happy
with
the
flavors
but
at
the
same
time
i
dont
hate
them
either
its
both
the
epitome
of
a
lovehate
tasting
my
tongue
is
like
the
woman
from
chinatown
or
the
plastic
surgeon
from
the
venture
brothers
confusion
reigns
but
it
is
clear
that
these
flavors
are
not
sticky
and
are
also
not
hampered
by
anywhere
near
excessive
carbonation
but
they
do
sort
of
malinger
for
a
while
during
a
very
long
dry
finish
honestly
i
dont
think
i
could
guzzle
this
if
i
wanted
to
and
im
kinda
glad
about
it
still
im
thankful
for
the
experience
the
drinkability
is
very
high
for
a
beer
of
this
strength
d
yeah
colossus
is
a
monster
with
plenty
of
heat
but
its
not
as
menacing
as
a
21
abv
brew
would
imply
dont
let
it
scare
you
this
is
spicy
fruity
and
quite
drinkable
for
what
it
is
d
at
21
this
is
a
sharing
beer
we
had
6
people
and
it
was
still
a
struggle
not
one
to
try
on
your
own
d
what
would
you
expect
with
a
20
beer
this
is
a
sipping
beer
to
be
savored
and
enjoyed
at
the
end
of
the
evening
much
like
a
fine
port
or
sherry
i
was
illprepared
for
this
beast
i
had
no
idea
i
was
coming
face
to
face
with
such
grotesque
twisted
fruit
and
floral
flavors
difficult
to
pick
a
fruit
exactly
it
seemed
like
some
chaotic
combination
of
prunes
rosepetals
allspicegingerinstant
cider
peachmango
some
red
and
green
jolly
ranchers
robitussin
and
cotton
candy
yeah
im
not
standing
by
that
as
scientific
but
its
somewhere
in
that
arena
in
terms
of
sugaryfloralsicklysweetness
this
was
an
issue
at
first
because
prior
to
opening
i
was
thinking
bitterness
brandy
no
it
should
be
noted
that
my
sweettooth
is
pretty
weak
yeah
keep
your
rumplemints
gran
marnier
and
jaegar
the
sweetness
was
so
unexpected
that
at
first
my
crutch
to
deal
with
it
was
some
homemade
jalapeno
salsa
which
id
have
intermittently
through
the
first
couple
ozs
that
leveled
it
out
quite
well
and
at
the
point
i
had
waded
in
past
my
balls
i
was
able
to
drink
it
like
a
normal
human
by
the
end
i
had
finally
come
to
enjoy
the
bizarre
and
extreme
concoction
both
for
its
uniqueness
and
for
the
wallop
it
was
giving
my
tongue
and
its
medicinal
warming
i
have
a
feeling
that
like
many
things
a
beer
of
this
stature
is
an
acquired
taste
it
was
remarkable
how
welldisguised
the
alcohol
is
considering
now
that
i
know
what
im
up
against
i
think
im
ready
for
another
bout
with
this
one
to
get
a
better
reading
and
for
nuking
it
which
i
didnt
know
was
possible
and
yes
that
will
then
be
a
shot
which
might
even
need
a
chaser
obviously
drinkability
is
low
for
the
average
brute
unless
you
drink
gran
marnier
shots
with
breakfast
everyone
should
buy
this
if
they
see
it
to
reckon
with
its
unique
presentation
when
normal
human
beer
seems
boring
or
to
make
drinking
a
22
with
a
pal
more
akin
to
a
sporting
event
of
straightface
keeping
im
having
trouble
finishing
a
single
glass
this
might
make
a
good
marinade
or
other
cooking
ingredient
not
a
beer
drinkability
american
strong
ale
indeed
its
more
of
a
shooter
than
it
is
a
beer
perhaps
its
a
hot
chaotic
mess
but
its
still
strangely
alluring
minus
the
40
price
tag
though
not
that
great
when
heated
its
like
all
i
can
taste
is
the
alcohol
this
ones
probably
best
served
slightly
chilled
like
white
wine
in
a
sipping
glass
i
had
this
at
a
temp
of
abour
50
degrees
this
became
very
overpowering
to
drink
after
a
while
and
i
choose
to
cut
it
with
a
hoppier
beer
to
take
out
the
sugar
taste
i
wasnt
impressed
with
the
price
35bottle
i
could
by
4
120
minute
ipa
from
dogfish
head
for
that
price
and
still
have
the
same
abv
content
its
worth
having
once
though
i
didnt
get
a
chance
to
warm
it
to
105
degrees
like
the
bottle
recommends
to
taste
the
warm
apple
pie
effect
this
bottle
if
sipped
will
accomodate
two
people
without
a
problem
so
get
someone
to
split
the
cost
with
you
this
is
also
available
at
wine

and
spirits
in
the
fridge
to
the

of
the
walk
in

on

top
shelf
enjoy
drinkability
good
just
a
little
too
sugary
for
my
taste
but
this
is
what
is
expected
in
a

an
alcohol

22

character
in

intense

aftertaste
is

lightly

alcohol

low
for

im
drinking
it
while
reviewing
strong
taste
of
malt
and
caramel
i
got
this
beer
as
part
of
a
build
your
own
six
pack
at
the
liquor
store
i
love
to
try
new
beers
and
hadnt
heard
of
this
one
so
i
thought
for
1
60
it
cant
hurt
to
try
it
it
was
money
well
spent
i
am
enjoying
this
beer
and
would
drink
it
again
any
time
cant
believe
its
8
avb
a
little
slippery
a
little
better
but
its
good
i
could
drink
4
of
these
an
old
friend
from
when
i
lived
in
mendocino
humboldt
this
has
a
very
thick
mouth
feel
and
hides
its
alcohol
well
a
very
malty
caramellike
taste
that
is
quite
unique
i
love
its
color
simply
delicious
beer
fantastic
overall
no
bottle
date
so
rated
as
it
tasted
which
was
like
a
6
month
old
ipa
not
to
sure
what
to
say
about
this
one
not
a
top
choice
to
buy
again
but
wouldnt
turn
it
down
tasted
from
a
12

very
strong
malt
flavor
some
hops
to
back
it
up
but
overall
very
malt
forward
lots
of
caramel
and
bready
biscuit
notes
very
full
bodied
beer
much
richer
than
i
would
anticipate
based
on
the
color
a
very
good
golden
ale
its
my
favorite
beer
because
it
brings
no
nonsense
with
its
flavor
and
it
doesnt
make
you
pay
with
burps
and
air
in
your
stomach
highly
recommended
eye
of
the
hawk
pours
a
redbrown
with
a
big
twofinger
head
which
dissipates
quickly
leaving
a
thin
white
cap
not
a
whole
bunch
going
on
in
the
flavor
department
a
quite
strong
caramelmalt
flavor
which
masks
the
high
abv
quite
well
almost
a
medicinal
malt
flavor
aroma
is
strongly
malt
based
not
a
well
balanced
malt
flavor
but
not
bad
i
first
tried
it
at
the
2011
minnesota
autumn
brew
review
the
brewery
rep
gave
my
uncle
and
i
a
bottle
under
the
table
and
was
quite
personable
left
a
good
impression
of
mendicino
brewing
for
me
id
drink
this
again
and
would
be
interested
in
trying
some
more
of
their
offerings
flavorful
but
not
real
balanced
this
is
a
very
decent
brew
with
the
hefty
8
abv
that
isnt
detectable
the
light
mouthfeel
is
a
throw
off
of
some
of
the
flavors
that
shine
through
this
reminds
me
of
what
a
candy
beer
would
be
almost
like
a
medicinal
fruit
syrup
followed
by
bready
malt
and
slight
hoppy
finish
though
nothing
screams
excellence
this
brew
is
still
worthy
price
point
2
2512
oz
bottle
overall
pretty
good
kind
of
flat
though
a
little
more
carbonation
would
have
brought
me
up
to
a
4
a
little
too
sweet
and
boozy
for
me
to
go
any
higher
than
that
but
still
a
good
beer
pours
a
cloudy
orangeyred
with
a
creamier
white
head
that
has
minor
retention
but
leaves
a
little
lacing
the
aroma
is
mild
with
only
some
nondescript
malt
sweetness
the
taste
has
a
little
more
oomph
as
there
are
some
nice
dark
fruit
notes
and
dark
bread
malt
flavors
the
body
has
a
nice
weight
to
it
with
a
smooth
finish
rjt
malt
dominant
and
not
the
most
complex
strong
ale
but
its
got
enough
citrus
and
bittering
hops
to
redeem
it
somewhat
i
really
liked
the
taste
when
it
first
hits
your
mouth
there
was
a
hint
of
something
metallic
in
the
aftertaste
but
like
an
earthy
metallic
not
like
an
old
tin
can
the
aftertaste
kept
me
from
giving
this
beer
a
higher
rating
but
overall
i
really
enjoyed
it
i
will
keep
some
at
home
this
would
go
well
with
any
foods
cooked
on
the
grill
especially
a
good
burger
i
would
recommend
this
to
a
friend
also
a
great
recommendation
to
anyone
looking
for
a
nice
hoppy
beer
or
one
with
an
above
average
alcohol
content
it
pours
dark
amber
and
cloudy
like
a
thunderstorm
with
lacings
and
an
off
white
foamy
head
that
dissapates
well
it
has
a
caramal
malt
aroma
a
pleasent
taste
of
caramalmalt
with
a
twinge
of
metal
taste
and
spikes
of
hops
and
pie
crusts
it
has
bit
of
an
edge
when
drink
but
goes
down
well
and
isnt
to
feeling
this
beer
is
bready
in
the
feel
not
too
thick
but
with
a
combination
of
moist
sweet
and
dry
that
works
well
in
its
medium
body

an
equally

leads
to

my

is
that
this
would
be
an
above

entry
slightly
more
hoppy
than
im
used
to
but
that
fits
into
my
preference
anyway
a
very
clean

beer
with
a
big

has
a
light
flowery
aroma
with
a
sweet

has
a

that
lands
on

a

gets

theres
nothing

i
came
into
it
thinking
it
was
an
american
pale
ale
and
finding
out
that
its
a
strong
ale
explains
some
things
there
really
werent
the
hops
i
was
expecting
theres
some
bitterness
in
the
back
but
its
mostly
malt
and
a
little
alcohol
well
hidden
as
it
warms
good
beer
give
it
a
try
a
small
frothy
dirty

overall
an

not
the

one
youll
drink

a

this
beer
with
a

on
the
label
pours
a
pale

color
its

clear
has
low
carbonation

wispy
white
head
the
aroma
is
considerably
fruity
apricot
plum
raisins
all
mixed
with
a
thick
alcohol
aroma
and
caramel
the
foretaste
is
moderately
sweet
but
not
quite
as
much
as
id
expected
from
the
smell
a
moderate
maltiness
mixed
with
a
little
grain
makes
the
beer
pleasantly
drinkable
by
the
midtaste
a
spicy
hop
flavor
sets
in
the
beer
finishes
on
a
fairly
serious
hop
note
all
in
all
this
is
a
solid
and
drinkable
beer
nothing
particularly
stands
out
as
spectacular
but
it
certainly
is
enjoyable
light
golden
with
ruby
hues
very
clear
and
quiet
with

noticeable
activity
in
the

department
with
that

to
speak
of
bouquet
was
made
up
of
orange
peel
fuzzy
malt
and
was
almost
overwhelmed
by
the
alcohol
in
the
end
there
was
a
nice
malt
flavor
but
again
the
pronounced
alcohol
seemed
to
do
it
in
jammy
sticky
mouthfeel
that
didnt
impress
and
was
a
little
biting
a
solid
beer
one
i
hope
to
enjoy
again
eye
of
the
hawk
is
one
of
mendocinos
better
offerings
at
least
of
the
few
that
ive
had
to
date
even
though
american
strong
ales
arent
near
the
top
of
my
favorite
style
list
i
thought
this
one
was
pretty
good
pretty
interesting
beer
but
just
not
complete
very
minimal
head
and
appeared
to
have
no
lacing
the
color
was
a
deep
golden
amber
there
was
a
good
amount
of
bottom
carbonation
which
is
common
with
strong
ales
aroma
was
kind
of
weak
and
all
i
could
pick
up
was
a
little
sweet
malt
smell
as
far
as
taste
goes
there
was
a
lot
of
different
flavors
coming
together
as
soon
as
it
hits
your
mouth
but
it
wasnt
neccessarilly
a
good
thing
the
finish
is
very
dry
with
a
heavy
grain
presence
the
high
abv
is
hidden
very
dangerously
and
i
can
imagine
a
few
pints
of
this
has
caused
some
dillemas
the
flavor
was
sweet
with
malt
and
a
slight
alcohol
flavor
and
warming
the
finish
was
nice
and
spicy
with
hops
the
balance
i
thought
was
just
right
a
nice
beer
was
a
bit
strong
on
the
abv
side
and
you
can
feel
it
after
one
this
orange
colored
ale
did
not
pour
much
of
a
head
and
is
leaving
a
sticky
residue
down
the
pint
smell
is
of
lemons
and
alcohol
taste
is
sweet
malts
a
little
hop
character
and
high
alcohol
not
an
overly
complex
beer
and
it
does
not
hide
the
abv
well
mouthfeel
is
fairly
full
it
is
a
fairly
drinkable
beer
i
have
paired
this
with
chili
as
i
was
thinking
this
was
a
pa
or
ipa
may
be
better
the
next
time
with
another
less
spicy
food
this
beer
poured
an
orangish
copper
color
with
a
small
light
yellow
head
the
smell
is
of
lots
of
toasted
malts
with
caramel
being
most
noticeable
and
then
a
huge
hop
strike
hits
my
nose
the
body
looks
and
is
medium
in
thickness
the
flavors
in
this
beer
balance
each
other
out
well
enough
there
is
a
very
sweet
caramel
taste
up
front
followed
by
some
spicy
hops
the
finish
seems
a
bit
weak
but
i
notice
some
bitterness
after
i
take
a
breath
this
seems
more
like
a
british
pale
ale
as
opposed
to
an
old
ale
imo
the
alcohol
is
not
noticeable
at
all
in
taste
i
cant
believe
its
8
but
it
did
knock
me
out
for
the
night
all
in
all
this
is
a
beer
worth
trying
but
nothing
to
get
too
excited
about
drinkable
yes
but
only
if
you
like

in

carbonated

caramel
malt
sweetness
is
the
first
impression
on
tasting
but
bitter
piney

obliberate
any

here
piney
and
floral

run
the
show
here
and
there
is
also
an

present
in

alcohol
becomes
a
distraction
toward
the
end
and
is
not
at
all
hidden
aftertaste
is
slightly
astringent
not
really
bad
but
not
one
of
my
favorites
char
i
really
think
i
would
like
this
beer
in
its
ideal
state
its
hoppiness
wellconcealed
abv
and
drinkability
appeal
to
me
but
as
it
is
i
have
to
grade
quite
low
ill
rereview
if
i
can
find
a
better
sample
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
lacey
white
head
the
aroma
is
plain
it
has
the
scent
of
lots
of
pale
malts
and
an
elevated
abv
the
taste
is
decent
it
has
a
very
malty
flavor
it
tastes
of
pale
and
carapils
malts
and
a
high
abv
the
mouthfeel
is
suspect
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
less
than
adequate
carbonation
the
beer
is
an
average
drinker
its
not
bad
but
its
also
not
that
great
either
the
label
describes
this
beer
as
rich
robust
and
complex
with
a
ton
of
flavor
almost
the
beer
is
not
at
all
complex
its
malt
hops
done
however
it
does
deliver
nicely
on
the
rest
of
its
promise
a
very
tasty
satisfying
brew
just
watch
out
for
the
bite

excellent

unless
you
are

however
even
seasoned
beeradvocates
should
use
a
little
caution
so
i
guess
its
right
there
in
the
middle
not
quite
a
barleywine
but
a
good
brew
as
an
introduction
to
one
a
dark
amber
brew
with
nice

retention
and
good
lace
the
nose
is
very
malty
and
hints
of
some
spicy

to
help
balance
the

the
flavor
is
fully
malty

with
mild

to
add
to
the

i
really
had
some

because
this
is
a

type
of
beer
it
was
no
better
in
my
opinion
than
most
amber
ales
im
pretty
generous
and
optimistic
and
try
to
review
according
to
the
standard
of
a
style
and
not
my
personal
whim
i
am
never
capricious
and
am
open
enough
to
have
been
charmed
by
styles
i
dont
like
but
this
beer
absolutely
sucks

strong
slightly
sweetmaybe
a
hint
of
fruity
smooth
and
richly
malty
with
sweetness
in
the
finish
this
is
a
very
nice
tasting
beer
with
some
good
complexity
very
drinkable
and
an
overall
good
beer
which
i
look
forward
to
tasting
again
color
was
a
very
orangy
amber
with
a
very
small
head
that
soon
diappeared
no
lacing
at
all
smelt
of
sweet
candyish
malt
taste
was
of
sweet
malt
with
a
mild
hoppiness
in
the
background
mouthfeel
was
o
k
nothing
to
write
home
about
this
is
a
very
sweet
drinkable
beer
and
could
probably
lead
someone
to
consume
a
lot
of
it
and
end
up
trashed
drinkability

this
is
like
drinking
highly
alcoholic
candy
well
done
after
all
is
said
and
done
this
wasnt
a
bad
experience
it
was
a
decent
bw
i
have
made
a
note
to
review
a
current
bottle
and
will
do
so
pours
a
deep
orange
with
a
real
nice
medium
creamysticky
headaroma
is
deeply
fruity
with
a
slightly
hop
background
i
realy
like
the
maltiness
of
this
beer
also
there
is
some
alcohol
notes
that
come
thru
in
the
finish
a
whisky
like
taste
stays
in
the
mouth
after
each
sip
iam
very
impressed
with
this
beervery
enjoyable
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
at
how
smooth
it
was
i
went
back
for
a
second
and
began
to
wonder
why
i
was
getting
a
bit
wobbly
near
the
end
when
i
noted
the
abv
this
beer
can
really
sneak
up
on
you
im
not
sure
that
this
ale
fits
into
the
barley
wine
style
but
its
certainly
a
strong
ale
it
pours
a
dull
amber
color
with
a
fading
1
white
head
that
settles
to
a
thin
coat
not
much
sticky
lace
theres
an
equal
aroma
of
sweet
malt
hops
and
alcohol
the
fairly
full
malt
reveals
sweet
caramel
notes
highly
hopped
with
citrusy
and
spicy
bitterness
slightly
astringent
and
strongly
alcoholic
this
is
one
powerfully
flavored
ale
nice
to
taste
a
strong
american
barley
wine
that
does
not
have
that
sickly
sweet
dark
caramel
maltiness
i
am
going
to
find
some
more
of
these
and
make
sure
that
my
initial
positive
response
was
not
a
fluke
if
i
didnt
read
the
beer
style
on
the
site
i
would
never
have
guessed
this
is
a
strong
ale
the
alcohol
is
so
well
hidden
it
pours
a
dark
orangeamber
color
with
a
medium
white
head
that
only
hangs
around
for
a
few
minutes
and
then
fades
away
leaving
just
the
slightest
bit
of
lace
bold
floral
hop
aromas
emerge
from
the
glass
followed
by
the
scent
of
citrus
peel
theres
virtually
no
alcohol
aroma
present
at
all
theres
a
lovely
bittersweet
taste
that
intermixes
with
light
carbonation
to
create
a
very
well
balanced
mouthfeel
i
swear
i
could
never
taste
the
alcohol
but
watch
out
itll
sneak
up
on
you
quick
and
before
you
realize
itbam
a
suckerpunch
come
flying
up
from
the
back
and
knocks
your
socks
off
an
orangish
brew
a
little
on
the
dark
side
slightly
hazy
a
mediumsized
head
forms
on
top
and
stays
but
only
for
a
few
minutes
the
aroma
is
a
very
acidic
hoppy
one
with
a
backbone
of
bready
malt
a
little
alcohol
is
noticeable
too
flavors
include
a
good
amount
of
hop
bitterness
in
areas
again
a
bit
acidic
malt
is
biscuity
and
bready
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
smooth
this
beer
improves
greatly
as
it
warms
finish
is
dry
and
hoppy
not
a
bad
effort
it
resembles
something
belgian
in
subtle
ways
interesting
beer
i
bought
this
beer
due
to
my
familiarity
with
red
tail
and
blue
heron
both
of
which
i
liked
like
other
reviewers
i
was
not
aware
that
this
was
a
strong
ale
while
i
was
drinking
it
as
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
perhaps
that
explains
my
disappointment
with
it
it
had
nice
copper
color
with
a
head
that
died
rather
quickly
more
of
a
malty
flavor
didnt
notice
much
in
the
way
of
aroma
or
hops
it
was
an
ok
beer
er
i
mean
strong
ale
perhaps
i
may
have
to
give
it
another
chance
poured
a
light
copper
color
and
was
a
bit
cloudy
bright
head
which
left
quickly
i
didnt
know
this
was
a
strong
beer
when
i
picked
it
out
the
smell
is
malty
with
some
sourness
in
the
aroma
heavy
and
rich
tasting
but
not
too
much
as
with
some
other
barleywines
ive
had
theres
a
hop
presence
but
it
seems
muted
by
the
malt
flavor
the
alcohol
is
hidden
a
pretty
decent
strong
ale
from
hollingshead
deli
in
orange
ca
took
me
2
mendocino
brews
to
catch
the
bird
theme
cool
pours
a
light
amber
color
with
a
thin
light
beige
head
aroma
is
malty
with
a
hint
of
alcohol
flavors
of
malt
and
caramel
dominate
with
a
little
hops
lingering
finish
is
somewhat
dry
abv
is
well
hidden
pretty
straightforward
beer
had
no
idea
this
baby
had
a
higher
abv
that
is
until
i
finished
it
off
last
night
around
my
fourth
beer
you
cant
even
detect
the
high
alcohol
in
this
brew
which
can
be
kind
of
dangerous
pours
an
orangeamber
with
a
copper
head
that
billows
pretty
thick
and
eventually
settles
out
the
forefront
of
flavor
is
the
hop
character
and
then
the
malt
crashes
through
biscuit
caramel
a
very
rich
and
complex
ale
that
starts
with
a
sweet
fruit
tone
and
then
the
bitterness
of
the
hop
resins
marches
in
to
blend
quite
a
well
balanced
ale
i
was
also
getting
a
hint
of
honey
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
intriguing
very
full
just
due
to
the
amount
of
flavor
medium
bodied
and
overall
very
delightful
ale
drinkability
is
fair
but
there
is
alot
going
on
here
kinda
complex
and
high
in
alcohol
to
keep
throwing
these
down
eye
of
the
hawk
pours
a
fairly
hazy
reddish
golden
beer
nice
looking
head
some
retention
this
has
a
shockingly
sweet
aroma
although
not
at
all
unpleasant
the
taste
is
unusual
there
seem
to
be
a
lot
of
hops
fighting
their
way
to
the
top
but
not
quite
getting
there
the
malt
taste
seems
a
little
cloying
but
flat
kind
of
leaves
me
not
really
liking
this
beer
edited
to
add
barley
wine
i
was
thinking
maybe
an
apa
huh
they
hide
the
booze
well
i
dont
think
mendocino
meant
this
to
be
a
barley
wine
strong
ale
is
more
accurate
for
this
brew
there
seems
to
be
a
good
nose
on
this
beer
that
reminds
me
of
other
barley
wines
i
have
had
lots
of
malt
and
a
smoky
aroma
the
taste
is
decent
but
has
a
bit
of
an
astingent
taste
that
is
not
quite
desirable
there
seems
to
be
a
nice
hopiness
to
the
beer
and
a
good
warming
effect
there
is
a
consistent
malt
character
throughout
however
that
astringency
seems
to
overpower
not
bad
but
not
great
pours
a
light
amber
with
a
fair
sized
offwhite
head
smells
of
apple
and
white
raisin
or
grape
very
medicinal
and
alcohol
tasting
almost
like
a
cough
syrup
this
is
not
necessarily
a
bad
thing
although
i
dont
go
looking
for
that
flavor
in
a
beer
pretty
hoppy
has
a
very
nice
mouthfeel
fairly
smooth
and
thick
the
drinkability
suffers
as
a
result
of
the
fairly
high
alcohol
content
holy
crap
this
is
a
dangerous
beer
i
suspect
this
beer
is
fermented
with
something
similar
to
wyeast
3056
bavarian
wheat
yeast
as
it
has
both
american
ale
and
german
wheat
characteristics
pleasant
but
the
alcohol
doesnt
jibe
very
well
with
the
rest
of
the
beer
hampering
its
drinkability
the
pour
a
limpid
golden
amber
color
with
a
bit
of
dross
suspended
throughout
the
glass
i
happen
to
like
the
taste
the
decocted
sediment
gives
the
beer
so
i
do
not
filter
it
out
as
many
do
head
is
massive
in
size
creamy
in
texture
and
the
resultant
lace
is
a
thick
clinging
sheet
to
seal
off
the
glass
aroma
of
sweet
malt
dominates
with
a
hint
of
sweet
country
butter
and
a
quite
fresh
and
pleasing
nose
start
is
sweet
middling
top
and
a
serious
acidic
bite
and
pleasant
hop
spicy
presence
aftertaste
dry
and
lingering
a
decent
drinking
beer
and
could
be
considered
a
session
beer
poured
a
hazy
orangish
color
with
little
head
fruity
aroma
hops
are
subdued
but
present
kind
of
fruity
but
not
terribly
so
nice
creamy
mouthfeel
leaves
a
bit
of
a
lattice
down
the
side
of
the
glass
minimal
carbonation
a
solid
brew
tasty
and
for
an
8
alchohol
brew
hides
it
quite
well
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
easily
poured
a
light
golden
color
with
little
to
no
foam
the
aroma
was
very
mild
with
a
hint
of
hops
and
spices
i
tasted
a
hint
of
spices
with
a
grainy
finish
there
was
a
slight
bitterness
on
the
palate
but
the
finish
disapated
quickly
i
have
the
black
eye
blended
ale
to
review
next
wonder
if
the
character
of
this
beer
will
be
destroyed
by
the
black
hawk
stout
medium
amber
in
color
with
a
sticky
head
that
leaves
a
nice
lattice
on
the
glass
interesting
aroma
of
damp
hay
musty
grain
and
fruity
esters
the
nose
is
alcoholic
carrying
a
strongly
fruity
malt
sweetness
concentrated
flavors
of
bready
pale
malt
come
through
towards
the
end
before
the
hops
clean
up
the
finish
it
leaves
a
nice
aftertaste
of
biscuit
malt
id
like
to
taste
the
hops
a
little
more
but
overall
an
ok
beer
and
it
looks
great
with
that
gummy
head
slightly
hazy
orange
amber
in
hue
covered
by
a
persistent
off
white
bumpy
head
web
like
lace
is
left
the
aroma
is
comprised
of
light
fruity
esters
sweet
caramel
biscuit
malt
an
earthy
hop
nose
w
hints
of
woodiness
subdued
diacetyl
butterscotch
is
present
as
well
fruity
sweetness
hits
the
palate
at
first
then
is
ensued
by
notes
of
buttery
toffee
and
toasty
malt
lightly
tart
yeast
esters
and
moderate
hop
bitterness
emerge
mid
palate
a
bit
light
in
body
but
the
all
around
smooth
nature
of
this
brew
lends
excellent
drinkability
finishes
quite
clean
w
mild
breadiness
fading
quickly
eye
of
the
hawk
is
a
flavorful
somewhat
understated
but
highly
drinkable
strong

overall
a
good

but
not
great
i
like
this
one
broke
out
a

i
had
stashed
in

has
done
it

drinks
very
deceptively
the

is
barely
noticed
a
very
nice
blend
of
malt
hop
neither
takes
the
spotlight
they
just
meld
together
in
a
super
finish
this
is
one
of
the
most
easydrinking
strong
ales
ive
had
the
pleasure
to
drink
from
one
of
the
founding
breweries
of
the
american
microbeer
renaissance
even
though
its
contract
brewed
in
upstate
n
y
its
still
a
classic
a
joy
to
drink
hefty
malt
that
is
not
too
sweet
i
was
astounded
to
see
that
this
is
8
abv
certainly
deserving
the
designation
strong
ale
i
did
not
find
a
hint
in
the
flavor
which
was
rather
hazardous
as
this
is
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
more
than
a
couple
and
its
snooze
time
on
the
couch
probably
the
best
of
the
mendocino
brews
imho
its
got
all
the
classic
characteristics
of
a
strong
ale
beefy
malt
alcoholic
undertones
subdued
hops
let
this
one
warm
a
bit
after
pouring
for
best
results
another
one
of
those
beers
that
i
have
to
look
for
when
i
leave
texas
clear
dark
amber
color
decent
offwhite
head
that
leaves
only
a
bit
of
lace
on
the
side
of
my
glass
wonderfully
fruity
nose
heavy
maltfruit
flavors
that
could
use
a
little
more
hop
balance
nothing
better
than
sitting
in
hopland
and
deciding
if
its
better
to
continue
north
to
eureka
or
go
to
fetzers
or
just
enjoy
another
eye
of
the
hawk
wonderfully
strong
malty
brew
made
for
a
damp
northern
california
afternoon
or
night
killer
beer
killer
not
meaing
good
though
this
is
a
good
beer
in
a
way
but
a
bit
devious
with
the
8
abv
we
get
this
beer
served
in
full
pints
around
boston
at
regular
beer
prices
an
evil
beer
to
love
great
malt
presence
citrisy
hop
flavor
diserving
alcohol
note
i
love
it
if
you
like
stones
arrogant
bastard
you
should
try
this
so
good
notes
hot
damn
complex
balanced
dangerously
drinkable
a
force
to
be
reckoned
with
in
its
own
right
consume
with
respect
o
outstanding
beer
that
displays
completely
different
profiles
on
the
smell
versus
the
taste
intense
in
two
different
ways
definitely
recommend
amazing
all
beer
should
model
itself
after
this
beauty
o
not
what
i
had
expected
this
was
almost
artificially
sweet
with
very
limited
spice
notes
big
brown
sugar
and
toasted
coconut
and
chocolate
notes
here
tough
share
to
have
this
one
the
flavors
didnt
come
out
against
the
rest
of
it
a
little
heavy
on
cinnamon
smells
really
nice
but
too
earthy
on
the
taste
absolutely
delicious
drinks
very
easy
for
such
a
hefty
brew
excellent
dessert
beverage
this
beer
was
just
overly
astringent
for
any
of
the
adjuncts
to
come
through
in
a
flavorful
way
pretty
disappointed
was
looking
forward
to
this
big
time
they
couldve
tricked
me
and
said
this
was
a
stout
regardless
this
was
a
crazy
good
beer
a
stand
out
at
aardwolfs
early
bird
special
bottle
release
glad
i
brought
this
and
shared
it
with
friends
verdict
a
really
spectacular
beer
from
fremont
so
explosive
and
flavorful
the
cinnamon
really
does
the
trick
here
but
the
coffee
isnt
to
be
forgotten
it
might
not
be
as
prolific
on
the
tongue
but
it
helps
to
bind
the
beer
together
really
well
this
was
truly
a
masterful
beer
one
of
the
best
ive
ever
had
the
pleasure
of
enjoying
cheers
fremont
overall
this
is
good
but
im
not
buying
the
hype
the
cinnamon
masks
a
lot
of
the
qualities
of
the
base
beer
really
loved
this
beer
super
impressive
but
then
i
am
a
huge
sucker
for
cinnamon
coffee
stouts
perfect
amount
of
sweetness
in
this
beer
no
booze
at
all
and
the
cinnamon
doesnt
overwhelm
the
rest
of
the
awesome
malt
flavors
going
on
super
impressive
beer
opaque
black
pour
from
a
bomber
into
a
snifter
finishes
with
a
small
khaki
head
smells
of
heavy
cinnamon
and
touch
of
coffee
notes
of
brown
sugar
and
oak
as
it
warms
taste
was
quite
complex
with
a
burst
of
cinnamon
followed
by
molasses
vanilla
raisins
chocolate
covered
cherries
and
hint
of
roast
coffee
good
weight
in
the
mouth
really
coating
the
tongue
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
the
cinnamon
starts
off
overpowering
but
fades
and
integrates
better
as
it
warms
i
think
this
is
an
outstanding
beer
but
i
enjoyed
the
standard
bbomb
a
bit
more
this
is
one
of
the
best
and
most
interesting
stouts
i
have
ever
had
so
much
bourbon
in
this
but
its
different
not
the
least
bit
sweet
mature
and
highly
refined
in
the
glass
it
looks
incredible
big
milkshake
head
on
it
dark
dark
brown
color
tons
of
viscosity
intimidating
and
luxurious
the
nose
is
awesome
too
i
get
the
coffee
and
the
cinnamon
both
in
equal
parts
right
away
not
spicy
on
the
cinnamon
more
mellow
very
appropriately
dosed
it
seems
there
is
a
nice
rich
roast
to
the
malt
clearly
a
combination
of
roasted
barley
chocolate
malt
and
something
in
the
mid
crystal
range
the
flavor
is
every
bit
as
good
as
the
nose
cinnamon
right
up
front
but
again
not
hot
and
unlike
all
the
beers
that
add
ancho
chili
or
something
like
that
to
these
this
one
doesnt
need
it
doesnt
miss
it
and
is
better
off
without
it
there
is
a
dark
chocolate
layer
to
segue
into
the
coffee
side
of
things
the
coffee
is
great
not
bitter
at
all
and
really
earthy
bringing
the
sweetness
of
the
bourbon
way
way
down
there
is
a
brown
sugar
note
in
there
too
and
the
wood
which
is
rustic
and
intense
so
different
than
any
other
barrel
aged
stout
ive
come
across
maybe
better
than
all
of
them
the
cinnamon
has
a
little
texture
to
it
helps
it
stay
dry
too
very
cool
the
finish
is
a
combination
of
all
the
flavors
the
bourbon
and
vanilla
the
cinnamon
the
base
beer
which
owns
by
the
way
and
the
coffee
which
i
think
lingers
the
longest
rich
and
lathery
on
the
feel
smooth
as
velvet
and
palate
coating
in
an
amazing
way
thats
not
sweet
at
all
just
so
incredible
fremont
has
me
hooked
with
this
one
really
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
ever
consumed
should
be
ranked
much
higher
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
tasted
the
cinnamon
is
slightly
intense
but
the
base
beer
does
not
fail
overall
just
really
a
great
beer
in
every
way
one
of
my
favorite
fremont
beers
ever
and
perhaps
also
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
chocolate
coffee
and
some
sort
of
nut
in
the
smell
lots
of
cinnamon
upfront
in
the
taste
not
getting
much
of
the
barrel
flavor
i
prefer
the
regular
bbomb
but
this
is
still
worthy
offering
bottom
line
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
one
im
proud
to
know
comes
from
my
city
i
havent
had
the
base
bbomb
in
a
hot
minute
so
i
cant
really
offer
meaningful
insights
to
compare
and
contrast
it
to
the
cinnamoncoffee
variation
no
im
not
cracking
into
the
bottles
ive
got
stored
away
for
a
beautiful
rainy
day
some
years
from
now
just
for
comparisons
sake
at
least
not
today
if
youve
ever
got
the
opportunity
to
drink
this
or
any
of
the
variants
or
the
base
bomb
or
even
the
base
abominable
really
for
that
matter
do
it
do
not
think
twice
do
not
pass
go
do
not
collect
200
wait
no
if
you
have
the
opportunity
to
snag
a
couple
hundo
on
the
way
to
drinking
this
definitely
do
that
and
then
use
it
to
buy
more
of
this
bit
of
a
mess
happy
to
stick
with
bbomb
overall
this
is
a
couple
of
steps
above
the
original
version
i
really
enjoy
the
unique
cinnamon
flavor
this
is
highly
recommended
pours
a
very
opaque
dark
brown
nearly
black
half
a
finger
of
light
brown
head
sticks
to
the
glass
some
smell
initially
was
straight
used
coffee
grounds
that
subsided
to
make
room
for
some
roasted
malt
faint
cinnamonnutmeg
a
touch
of
alcohol
mild
oak

and
some
bakers
chocolate
too
flavor
is
sweet
chocolate
some
mild
roastcoffee
hint
of
some
sweet
fruit
cherry
and
a
tinge
of
alcohol
really
nice
beer
mouthfeel
is
a
nice
medium
mouthfeel
with
low
carbonation
one
of
the
better
winter
beers
out
there
served
alongside
bourbon
abominable
dark
brown
body
with
a
small
beige
cap
grandiose
cinnamon
aroma
followed
by
bourbon
and
vanilla
spice
and
booze
brown
sugar
and
bourbon
hard
to
compare
this
to
its
counterpart
as
they
are
vastly
different
coffee
character
is
overshadowed
this
is
a
showcase
for
cinnamon
and
while
the
flavor
is
tasty
this
is
definitely
best
split
a
few
ways
yum
aged
beer
the
coffee
and
cinnamon
are
gentle
enough
to
add
flavor
but
does
not
take
away
from
the
barrel
and
the
base
stout
which
are
both
delicious
a
little
boozy
but
this
is
the
newest
batch
wow
this
is
delicious
trade
for
this
overall
very
good
a
nice
twist
on
bbomb
i
would
probably
take
this
over
regular
bbomb
but
its
only
because
im
so
hip
with
the
trends
this
is
like
bcbcs
with
less
heat
less
viscosity
and
cinnamon
added
fantastic
stuff
that
should
be
sought
out
edit
from
122814
had
this
beer
on
tap
at
the
red
hot
and
immediately
realized
i
need
to
increase
my
original
score
on
tap
at
the
rh
and
with
some
time
to
sit
and
contemplate
this
great
beer
it
was
apparent
just
what
a
great
beer
this
is
the
coffee
and
cinnamon
seemed
to
blend
in
seamlessly
with
the
base
beer
and
the
bourbon
giving
the
beer
a
wonderful
coffee
caramel
toffee
nougat
and
milk
dud
flavor
profile
to
no
great
surprise
this
beer
was
incredibly
popular
at
the
red
hot
even
at
10
for
an
11
5
ounce
pour
they
blew
through
their
keg
in
less
than
a
day
this
is
just
delicious
stuff
much
more
balanced
coffee
and
cinnamon
out
of
the
bottle
vs
draft
deliciously
creamy
and
lush
on
the
tongue
one
of
the
smoothest
ba
coffee
beers
i
have
experienced
very
tasty
strong
cinnamon
but
well
balanced
flavors
good
barrel
influences
a
little
too
hot
for
my
liking
otherwise
it
was
very
good
probably
not
something
i
would
seek
out
again
unless
it
were
sitting
on
a
shelf
but
i
am
glad
to
have
tried
it
othis
is
a
tasty
beer
it
straddles
the
line
between
stout
and
strong
ale
dont
drink
this
looking
for
hops
because
you
wont
find
any
i
liked
the
chewy
feel
some
may
think
it
is
too
think
a
very
new
new
world
beer
this
is
my
absolute
favorite
beer
its
perfectly
balanced
and
has
a
nice
alcohol
bite
the
finest
beer
ive
ever
tasted
thank
you
fremont
wow
this
is
a
really
well
done
beer
initial
thought
as
it
hits
my
tongue
is
uncle
jacobs
like
which
happens
to
be
one
of
my
favorite
beers
so
that
means
i
like
it
i
like
it
a
lot
very
well
balanced
not
too
much
heat
lots
of
deep
flavor
and
bourbon
characteristics
creamy
vanilla
and
sweet
chocolate
the
earthy
wood
flavors
hint
in
at
the
end
this
is
really
good
2014
version
drinking
really
smooth
despite
the
heat
and
recent
vintage
id
buy
this
again
and
again
if
i
could
find
it
heat
from
the
bourbon
and
abv
is
warming
but
not
so
overwhelming
that
you
miss
the
notes
of
chocolate
and
some
vanilla
slightly
sweet
too
with
dark
brown
sugar
notes
really
delicious
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
fremont
release
wow
one
of
my
top
3
bourbon
barrel
aged
beers
of
all
time
poured
from
a
2014
dated
bomber
into
a
snifter
pours
like
a
stout
with
a
deep
black
body
and
a
finger
of
khaki
head
nose
of
brown
sugar
vanilla
oak
and
booze
taste
was
brown
sugar
vanilla
and
a
chocolate
covered
cherry
finish
it
was
a
little
light
in
the
mouth
but
still
satifying
overall
this
was
an
outstanding
beer
in
the
same
class
as
parabola
and
bcbs
what
boots
this
rating
down
for
me
a
little
bit
is
that
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
cloying
and
syrupy
the
flavor
is
good
overall
love
the
bourbon
vanilla
but
it
is
a
bit
sweet
for
my
tastes
a
4
oz
pour
would
have
been
perfect
its
the
syrupy
muddled
finish
that
keeps
the
beer
from
an
upper
echelon
rating
for
me
there
are
many
breweries
across
the
country
that
can
create
a
barrel
aged
beer
that
finishes
well
all
the
way
through
the
taste
experience
this
one
doesnt
finish
well
with
that
caramelly
syrupy
finish
o
a
really
enjoyable
beer
i
never
had
the
original
version
but
i
would
definitely
seek
out
the
other
versions
and
this
one
again
this
is
as
close
to
bourbon
county
as
ive
had
in
a
while
thick
rich
and
decadent
but
not
as
boozy
and
sweet
which
is
a
good
thing
this
beer
is
the
real
deal
certainly
worth
seeking
out
a
wonderfully
complex
beer
with
a
balance
of
bourbon
caramel
sweetness
hops
and
a
touch
of
stout
qualities
poured
from
22oz
bottle
pours
black
with
at
least
a
finger
of
tan
head
that
dissipates
within
a
few
minutes
wonderful
aroma
of
bourbon
chocolate
vanilla
and
a
fig
or
date
smell
that
is
reminiscent
of
a
barleywine
taste
is
delicious
you
get
a
nice
amount
of
bourbon
but
not
overpowering
other
tastes
of
vanilla
caramel
subtle
chocolate
and
again
that
fruityfiglike
essence
mouthfeel
is
fullbodied
and
smooth
nicely
carbonated
overall
this
is
a
special
treat
that
does
not
seem
as
big
as
it
feels
after
imbibing
11oz
of
this
toasty
goodness
served
alongside
cinnamon
coffee
bourbon
abominable
near
black
body
with
a
small
beige
collar
rich
aroma
of
bourbon
and
malts
big
time
oak
presence
with
lovely
notes
of
both
chocolate
and
vanilla
absolutely
delicious
aged
in
15yr
old
bourbon
barrels
am
interested
to
know
which
exactly
excellent
nose
and
a
bit
boozy
if
i
hadnt
just
recently
had
spice
wars
id
call
this
excellent
its
still
very
good
but
it
doesnt
have
the
complexity
or
the
smoothness
of
that
beer
id
be
interested
in
getting
another
bottle
or
two
and
laying
them
down
for
a
year
or
two
and
see
what
its
like
when
its
mellowed
a
bit
this
is
all
coconut
and
vanilla
big
bourbon
notes
exceptionally
smooth
decently
thick
coating
mouth
feel
overall
amazing
but
not
really
a
winter
warmer
more
barrel
aged
stout
serving
type
bottle
the
flavor
is
really
where
its
at
for
me
great
bourbon
character
strong
vanilla
notes
caramel
dark
roasted
malt
bitter
chocolate
this
tastes
considerably
better
than
it
smells
a
bit
hot
sticky
finish
overall
just
drink
it
it
tastes
great
one
of
my
favorite
barrelaged
beers
and
a
great
example
of
fremonts
exceptional
brewing
skill
a
fantastic
beer
listed
as
an
old
ale
but
tastes
like
a
top
notch
barreled
barleywine
22oz
bottle
of
the
2012
vintage
thanks
to
a
trading
buddy
dark
borwn
color
short
head
smells
pretty
nice
bourbon
booze
wood
flavor
is
pretty
good
too
heavily
bourbon
influenced
boozy
oak
vanilla
not
bad
at
all
if
i
had
to
guess
blindfolded
i
would
have
said
this
was
a
bourbon
barrel
aged
barleywine
o
definitely
one
of
washingtons
finest
beers
the
bourbon
character
is
beautifully
expressed
id
like
a
little
more
spice
and
perhaps
a
little
more
roasted
malt
flavour
this
is
nonetheless
a
wonderfully
crafted
brew
and
if
it
werent
for
my
preference
for
the
flavour
profile
of
stouts
more
chocolate
peat
and
coffee
this
might
score
even
higher
the
abv
is
entirely
an
afterthought
a
must
try
particularly
if
you
like
vanilla
and
bourbon
overall
barrel
is
the
highlight
and
the
beer
is
just
interesting
enough
to
prop
up
the
barrel
flavors
the
2013
abominable
bourbon
winter
ale
was
served
to
me
by
myself
from
a
half
growler
i
filled
about
half
an
hour
ago
this
ale
appears
pitch
black
with
a
smooth
tan
minimal
head
there
are
ultrafine
bubbles
that
seem
to
melt
from
the
sides
as
i
move
the
ale
around
in
my
brandy
snifter
as
i
give
the
drink
some
time
to
settle
the
head
has
retreated
back
into
a
halo
with
a
spotty
uneven
smooth
fine
cover
of
bubbles
the
smell
is
of
sweet
vanilla
caramel
and
a
hint
of
alcohol
nothing
else
the
taste
is
rich
delicious
and
decadent
like
a
fine
desert
there
is
vanilla
light
caramel
spice
molasses
and
an
obscure
taste
of
boozealcoholbourbon
the
mouthfeel
is
faintly
sizzling
with
sweet
feedback
no
bitter
taste
no
after
taste
no
complaints
only
recommendations
quite
enjoyable
not
that
im
surprised
but
this
is
yet
another
excellent
beer
from
the
folks
at
fremont
brewing
also
good
as
it
tasted
at
fred
fest
2014
i
think
this
beer
is
built
for
the
long
haul
and
will
likely
only
improve
with
a
few
years
of
bottle
or
barrelkeg
age
impressive
o
sitting
on
backyard
deck
sun
setting
and
chair
reclining
further
and
further
back
this
beer
was
a
very
nice
sipper
wonderful
great
job
fremont
wonderful
bourbon
barrel
usage
here
as
good
as
any
lots
of
burnt
oak
flavor
with
the
attendant
vanilla
and
booze
all
are
soft
and
gentle
though
and
none
so
dominant
as
to
displace
the
strong
ale
base
on
this
which
is
a
caramel
malt
bomb
super
thick
and
downright
delicious
although
a
bit
out
of
season
right
now
i
think
reddish
hues
of
caramel
and
molasses
color
and
the
aromas
are
similarly
sweet
toffee
and
vanilla
dessert
come
to
mind
and
of
course
the
bourbon
which
adds
richness
sweetness
and
the
feeling
like
im
having
something
of
extreme
quality
the
flavor
is
sweet
from
the
outset
but
doesnt
really
finish
that
way
more
of
a
quicker
boozy
hit
to
wind
it
down
vanilla
is
strong
and
the
oak
contributes
quite
a
bit
but
the
base
beer
is
exceptional
as
much
sticky
sweet
grain
as
you
can
pack
in
here
which
gives
a
luxurious
mouthfeel
to
this
highly
viscous
brew
carbonation
is
low
medium
but
its
all
i
really
need
in
this
style
something
more
than
a
barleywine
here
but
in
that
sort
of
vein
stylistically
my
first
brew
from
fremont
is
an
absolute
pleasure
made
even
more
enjoyable
by
sharing
it
with
some
of
the
gentlemen
responsible
for
its
existence
a
real
treat
worthy
of
its
high
praise
o
a
very
pleasant
warming
winter
ale
everything
is
well
integrated
highly
recommended
taste
is
sweet
and
thick
with
a
smoothness
rarely
found
on
an
11
er
marshmallow
fluff
meets
whiskey
barrel
burnt
caramel
molasses
and
cocoa
powder
flavors
as
well
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
full
and
silky
amazing
beer
that
i
wish
i
had
more
of
much
more
more
please
overall
a
pretty
decent
beer
but
just
a
tad
too
boozy
and
sweet
to
me
still
glad
to
have
tried
it
oa
really
good
beer
good
balance
nice
barrel
flavor
thankful
to
have
tried
it
this
is
more
interesting
than
it
is
good
but
it
is
quite
good
o
a
phenomenal
beer
on
par
with
the
best
ba
barleywinesstrong
ales
o
its
a
really
great
not
excellent
beer
to
me
i
can
say
its
definitely
above
midpack
but
for
the
rarity
of
it
others
are
better
overall
man
this
is
a
well
done
brew
overall
after
a
few
more
sips
this
might
graduate
to
a
great
beer
it
is
without
a
doubt
a
really
good
beer
and
its
almost
great
this
is
a
must
try
and
im
leaning
toward
great
no
flaws
absolutely
solid
complete
with
an
endearing
sublimity
next
to
evident
alcohol
very
well
put
together
i
appreciate
brewers
that
are
this
meticulous
fuller
end
of
medium
bodied
with
soft
carbonation
really
nice
mouthfeel
for
the
style
thick
but
not
viscous
with
surprising
crisp
carbonation
that
really
helps
again
the
barrel
presnce
is
really
prominent
with
lots
of
bourbon
flavor
but
its
not
hot
or
overly
boozy
sweet
bourbon
with
some
spicy
rye
along
with
dry
toasted
oak
vanilla
bean
and
some
toasted
coconut
after
the
beer
warms
im
picking
up
more
dark
malt
spice
and
vinous
fruit
sweetness
a
little
peppery
spice
and
rye
compliment
the
spirit
flavors
theres
also
some
cherry
and
other
dark
berries
along
with
some
silky
chooclate
sweetness
and
subtle
roast
still
this
beer
is
a
bit
bourbon
heavy
but
the
lack
of
heat
makes
it
pretty
easy
to
drink
verdict
a
nice
bourbon
treated
beer
from
fremont
the
chicory
root
flavor
isnt
my
favorite
but
the
smooth
and
rich
flavors
are
very
nice
its
just
a
touch
on
the
earthy
side
and
it
could
use
a
bit
more
body
that
being
said
i
had
no
issue
finishing
a
bomber
of
this
22
ounce
bottle
into
snifter
2012
vintage
pours
fairly
pitch
black
color
with
a
small
tan
head
with
poor
retention
that
reduces
to
a
thin
lace
that
lingers
light
spotty
lacing
clings
on
the
glass
aromas
of
big
dark
chocolate
cocoa
roasted
malt
cinnamon
toast
dark
bread
pepper
clove
bourbon
vanilla
oak
toffee
raisin
brown
sugar
and
roasted
earthiness
fantastic
aromas
with
great
balance
and
complexity
of
malt
spice
and
barrel
notes
with
great
strength
taste
of
dark
chocolate
cocoa
roasted
malt
toast
dark
bread
cinnamon
vanilla
oak
clove
bourbon
toffee

light
raisin
and

toast
cinnamon
dark
bread
clove
vanilla
oak
bourbon
toffee
brown
sugar
and
roasted
earthiness
on
the
finish
for
a
while
incredible
complexity
and
balance
of
malt
spice
and
barrel
flavors
with
huge
robustness
and
zero
cloying
sweetness
after
the
finish
light
carbonation
and
very
full
bodied
with
a
very
creamy
slick
and
moderately
syrupy
mouthfeel
that
is
great
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
with
only
a
small
warming
noticed
after
the
finish
overall
this
is
an
absolutely
incredible
barrel
aged
winter
ale
all
around
incredible
balance
and
complexity
of
dark
malt
spice
and
barrel
flavors
and
very
smooth
to
sip
on
for
the
abv
a
highly
amazing
offering
as
expected
this
beer
was
amazing
on
all
levels
i
havent
given
a
beer
5s
across
the
board
in
a
long
time
but
this
one
deserved
it
oaky
bourbon
mixed
with
warm
vanilla
beans
and
smooth
dark
chocolate
hints
of
booze
here
and
there
nice
warm
feeling
in
the
belly
after
each
sip
the
bourbon
isnt
overdone
here
its
a
key
player
but
not
a
dominant
force
the
warm
chocolate
aspects
really
shine
through
and
the
nuances
of
the
barrel
make
this
a
true
delight
to
sip
and
enjoy
this
beer
made
the
campfire
seem
warmer
the
friends
seemed
friendlier
and
i
was
happy
as
could
be
the
entire
time
i
was
enjoying
this
what
more
can
one
ask
for
in
a
beer
it
is
the
middle
of
summer
and
yet
im
drinking
this
awesome
ale
very
strong
at
11
yet
balanced
and
delicious
very
little
head
and
an
intricate
flavor
pattern
that
changes
as
it
watms
and
yet
maintains
the
bourbon
undertones
i
love
this
beer
and
still
have
four
left
o
this
one
kills
it
in
the
flavor
category
obviously
age
has
treated
it
well
thank
you
satlymalty
for
dipping
into
your
cellar
to
send
me
this
dangerously
tasty
brew
o
damn
this
brew
is
so
freaking
good
and
i
will
be
always
iso
for
it
mouthfeel
is
everything
that
i
want
in
a
bba
brew
big
thick
chewy
beautiful
lingers
sweetness
that
can
cut
out
the
alcohol
heat
simply
terrific
overall
very
nice
restrained
and
untainted
o
great
flavorful
beer
with
lots
of
vanilla
caramel
and
chocolate
the
amount
of
barrel
in
this
one
makes
you
understand
why
they
call
it
bbomb
easy
to
drink
for
a
big
beer
and
im
wishing
i
had
another
couple
bottles
to
age
as
i
could
see
this
improving
with
some
time
behind
it
well
worth
seeking
out
but
grab
one
now
and
one
for
later
o
rich
complex
strong
but
easy
to
drink
very
pleasant
o
a
really
tasty
beer
the
barrel
flavors
are
sweet
rich
and
just
allaround
delicious
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
overall
a
very
pleasant
beer
o
a
big
fan
of
this
one
almost
running
into
stout
territory
but
more
towards
the
balance
of
rich
sugars
and
bourbonvanilla
with
some
chocolate
accompaniment
that
roastfocused
overall
a
fantastic
bourbon
stout
really
diggin
this
one
and
a
perfect
way
to
start
a
4
day
weekend
an
interesting
take
and
result
for
a
barrel
aged
brew
fun
one
to
drink
also
and
very
easy
drinking
also
phenomenal
intense
maltiness
and
barrel
flavors
without
being
too
sweet
just
amazing
overall
d
interesting
stuff
its
definitely
a
winter
ale
and
somewhat
hard
to
peg
stylewise
a
bit
more
heft
and
spritz
would
do
this
wonders
but
its
still
pretty
enjoyable
id
have
this
again
although
i
dont
know
if
id
go
out
of
my
way
to
trade
for
it
in
the
future
devilishly
smooth
and
easily
drinkable
complete
with
the
traditional
flavors
youd
expect
from
a
bba
barleywine
though
its
labeled
as
a
strong
ale
creamy
bourbon
and
oak
along
with
a
unique
bittersweet
cocoa
flavor
that
comes
into
play
absolutely
fabulous
never
felt
daunting
or
undrinkable
even
for
its
size
wonderful
barrel
characters
and
a
phenomenal
base
easily
in
my
top
ten
pours
a
dark
brown
color
this
beer
almost
looks
like
a
stout
the
smell
is
sweet
with
some
dark
fruit
and
caramel
notes
there
is
a
strong
sweetness
in
the
flavor
but
the
roasted
malt
notes
balance
it
out
a
bit
i
enjoyed
the
caramel
and
dark
fruit
along
with
the
bourbon
the
finish
is
sweet
with
a
roast
bitterness
fantastic
beer
thick
and
sludgy
with
a
wonderful
heavy
barrel
experience
this
one
is
dripping
in
bourbon
oak
and
vanilla
different
style
but
still
leaps
and
bounds
ahead
of
kds
as
far
as
fremont
ba
beers
i
downed
a
whole
bottle
of
this
myself
and
it
was
good
to
the
last
drop
o
this
is
close
to
being
a
flawless
example
of
the
style
close
but
not
quite
there
fantastic
this
is
special
stuff
disappointing
lack
of
aroma
though
this
beer
has
a
moderate
amount
of
booziness
but
the
sweetness
and
mild
chocolate
aspect
with
substantial
vanilla
does
work
out
to
be
a
decent
beer
i
dont
think
my
rating
is
gonna
be
above
the
average
but
when
judged
by
a
non
local
i
think
this
will
be
an
overall
positive
experience
just
dont
have
your
expectations
so
high
that
you
think
youre
getting
a
world
class
experience
youre
just
getting
a
good
pacnw
experience
in
terms
of
barrel
experiments
definitely
one
of
their
best
yet
o
another
great
one
from
fremont
in
the
barrel
aged
category
o
a
great
beer
the
barrel
shines
through
nicely
and
did
an
amazing
job
of
transforming
abomb
into
bbomb
opaque
dark
brown
body
with
low
carbonation
almost
stoutlike
in
appearance
the
nose
is
great
heavy
on
rich
brown
sugar
vanilla
and
caramel
plenty
of
bourbon
barrel
leather
notes
pop
out
as
it
warms
along
with
a
little
black
licorice
the
palate
brings
a
nice
mix
of
sweet
burnt
sugar
bourbon
vanilla
and
leather
body
is
full
almost
syrupy
mellow
heat
finishes
on
the
dry
side
quite
a
bit
of
tannic
oak
surprisingly
great
beer
o
just
a
fantastic
beer
awesome
barrel
integration
into
the
overall
profile
of
the
base
beer
an
american
strong
ale
is
kind
of
a
catch
all
style
in
my
eyes
but
its
been
awhile
since
one
has
really
impressed
me
in
awhile
this
is
just
plain
good
o
an
outstanding
barrelaged
beer
i
recently
acquired
two
bottles
and
was
planning
on
cellaring
the
second
well
see
how
long
i
can
hold
out
in
a
sea
of
bourbon
barrelaged
beers
that
continues
to
trend
this
one
is
above
the
middle
of
the
pack
smacks
of
that
bourbon
barrel
it
was
aged
in
balances
just
enough
while
still
stirring
the
palate
with
interest
damn
tasty
my
thanks
to
gueuzehead
for
this
special
brew
poured
from
22oz
bomber
into
tulip
glass
pours
a
dark
brownalmostblack
appearance
with
a
half
inch
offwhite
head
that
dissipates
within
the
next
minute
the
nose
picked
up
oaky
vanilla
light
undertones
of
licorice
figs
mild
chocolate
and
bourbon
the
flavor
packs
a
nice
smooth
but
a
wallop
of
bourbon
heat
and
goodness
along
with
some
caramel
chocolate
chocolate
malts
medium
to
just
prethick
mouthfeel
with
a
nice
stickiness
to
it
nice
smooth
and
warming
backfinish
with
some
pleasant
bourbon
heat
i
was
sure
glad
this
beer
was
classified
as
a
winter
warmer
because
this
bit
a
piece
of
hardywood
gbs
and
the
bourbon
version
as
well
from
behind
for
the
alltime
winter
beers
ive
had
to
date
a
really
nice
job
by
fremont
brewing
o
this
was
very
delicious
the
spices
still
came
through
while
the
barrel
really
shined
id
love
to
lay
one
down
and
see
what
some
age
does
to
it
o
ive
heard
this
described
as
a
barleywine
but
i
would
say
its
closer
to
a
stout
in
fact
it
reminds
me
very
much
of
goose
islands
bourbon
county
brand
stout
perhaps
with
a
slightly
less
decadent
base
beer
if
you
havent
figured
it
out
by
now
the
fact
that
i
am
comparing
this
to
bcbs
means
it
is
an
outstanding
brew
the
effort
and
care
that
went
into
creating
this
is
apparent
from
the
first
sip
havent
had
kentucky
dark
star
but
i
am
seriously
iso
after
abominable
here
if
it
is
anything
like
this
than
fremont
may
just
have
a
barrel
program
on

mouth
watering
finish
im
really
really
impressed
with
this
beer
wow
nice
an
excellent
whiskey
beer
rather
expensive
i
got
mine
for
18usd
for
a
22oz
bottle
at
a
local
grocery
which
is
by
far
the
highest
price
for
any
bottled
beer
ive
seen
in
a
nonspecialty
store
but
i
have
to
say
that
it
was
worth
every
penny
would
buy
again
o
really
nice
ba
beer
strong
ale
is
probably
an
accurate
term
maybe
a
bit
of
an
american
barleywine
balanced
without
the
over
the
top
hops
that
can
sometimes
be
found
in
the
style
actually
the
more
i
drink
this
strong
ale
is
appropriate
nicely
complex
with
very
good
blend
of
sugary
flavors
almost
ideal
integration
of
bourbon
barrel
aging
super
smooth
alcohol
is
noticeable
but
in
control
with
just
enough
intensity
and
not
overpowering
the
beeriness
this
is
quite
nice
overall
this
is
an
awesome
winter
sipper
sweet
bourbon
rich
beer
that
doesnt
fit
nicely
into
any
category
good
complexity
there
are
better
ba
beers
but
theres
nothing
bad
to
say
about
this
one
could
be
a
little
more
balanced
with
the
alcohol
but
its
never
unpleasant
o
this
is
a
most
excellent
beer
one
of
the
best
ba
beers
ive
had
would
definitely
seek
this
out
on
a
regular
basis
o
i
actually
didnt
like
this
beer
at
first
i
might
have
started
at
too
cold
a
temperature
but
even
after
letting
it
warm
i
didnt
think
it
improved
significantly
on
the
other
hand
didnt
think
it
was
worthy
of
being
poured
down
the
drain
so
i
opened
an
ipa
and
found
that
alternating
between
this
beer
and
an
ipa
made
both
beers
better
note
we
drank
a
2012
vintage
last
night
and
it
was
spectacular
the
mouthfeel
was
much
thicker
and
heavier
than
the
2011
which
helped
the
overall
experience
excellent
stuff
easily
a
4
5
beer
thanks
again
erik
o
this
lived
up
to
the
hype
and
really
impressed
me
i
would
drink
this
all
the
time
if
it
was
available
to
me
o
very
nice
ba
beer
pretty
bourbon
forward
but
works
well
in
this
beer
sterling
example
on
a
barrel
aged
bourbon
forward
beer
can
tell
why
they
call
this
the
catch
all
strong
ale
as
opposed
to
stout
or
barleywine
my
belly
is
warm
for
a
beer
still
albeit
barely
in
the
single
digits
eminently
drinkable
this
improves
markedly
as
it
warms
a
bit
rather
flat
when
cold
it
really
opens
up
really
good
just
a
cold
nose
from
the
upper
echelon
to
describe
this
beer
in
two
words
smooth
and
deep
excellent
integration
of
the
base
beer
and
the
barrel
flavors
bringing
out
the
best
of
both
sweet
rich
and
fabulously
flavorful
up
there
with
my
favorite
barrelaged
english
barleywines
or
whatever
you
want
to
call
them
pours
an
almost
opaque
super
dark
brown
with
a
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
an
oily
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
dark
roasted
malt
cocoa
vanilla
wood
bourbon
and
some
slight
smoke
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
woody
and
bourbon
forward
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
roasty
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
with
a
nice
aroma
and
a
great
flavor
that
make
it
easy
to
drink
drink
i
can
see
why
this
was
so
coveted
it
had
great
flavor
it
was
rich
and
spicy
and
bourbon
forward
but
retained
the
winter
warmer
flavors
outstanding
job
o
decent
beer
the
major
flaw
is
the
mouthfeel
but
i
also
dont
care
for
the
spiciness
its
not
overpowering
but
just
under
the
surface
for
some
reason
it
doesnt
jive
with
me
overall
just
wow
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
in
a
while
simply
outstanding
expectations
not
only
met
but
exceeded
fremont
does
it
again
ill
gladly
pay
17bottle
for
more
of
this
next
year

overall
worldclass
o
a
very
good
bourbon
aged
beer
bronze
for
a
reason
overall
this
is
a
winner
thank
you
very
much
matt
if
you
have
a
bottle
drink
it
now
you
wont
be
disappointed
then
trade
for
another
major
kudos
to
fremont
brewing
for
creating
that
rarest
of
beers
worthy
of
being
called
an
instant
classic
o
very
fine
beer
really
glad
to
try
it
both
of
us
enjoyed
each
glass
i
think
i
was
impatient
with
this
one
dammit
as
i
feel
with
a
bit
more
age
this
one
will
be
steller
malt
meld
the
fruit
and
barrel
together
while
toning
down
burn
would
love
to
try
this
one
with
a
year
on
it
overall
this
brew
backed
up
its
high
rating
and
regards
exceptionally
complex
beer
w
utterly
perfect
ba
qualities
and
oh
so
smooth
fantastic
stuff
this
is
one
of
those
cases
where
i
should
have
shared
this
beer
with
someone
but
im
selfishly
glad
i
didnt
pours
jet
black
with
tons
of
lacing
not
a
complaint
in
the
world
smells
divine
great
balance
of
oak
bourbon
chocolate
dark
fruit
banana
bread
and
spice
taste
follows
the
nose
but
is
incredibly
rich
almost
but
not
to
a
fault
mouthfeel
is
semi
carbonated
and
fairly
syrupy
but
finishes
long
and
a
little
bitter
this
is
a
really
great
seasonal
beer
i
would
not
be
so
greedy
next
time
as
this
would
be
a
perfect
finish
to
thanksgiving
or
christmas
dinner
i
wish
i
would
have
bought
another
bottle
overall
fantastic
overall
i
love
it
when
breweries
can
make
a
barrel
aged
beer
with
near
perfect
carbonation
like
this
it
makes
the
beer
experience
that
much
better
it
balanced
and
its
complex
big
flavors
yet
remains
smooth
just
a
great
beer
its
makes
me
think
this
is
a
beer
that
would
have
been
the
brain
child
of
a
collaboration
between
firestone
walker
and
hair
of
the
dog
it
reminds
me
of
an
english
barleywine
and
an
olde
ale
blended
then
barrel
aged
this
is
very
delicious
great
stuff
the
body
is
full
with
smooth
carbonation
a
little
hot
on
the
finish
overall
this
one
is
real
tasty
glad
to
have
the
chance
to
give
it
a
whirl
thick
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
o
this
is
an
excellent
beer
imo
best
local
beer
i
tasted
to
date
hope
this
beer
gets
produced
more
and
distributed
wider
maybe
a
bit
pricey
though
although
worth
the
try
yes
you
should
seek
this
one
out
o
a
truly
nice
brew
big
bold
bourbon
flavor
initially
with
a
smooth
well
balanced
finish
2010
vintage
served
in
a
snifter
and
a
fairly
aggressive
pour
reveals
a
quarter
inch
offwhite
head
the
smell
is
big
vanilla
bourbon
and
malty
sweetness
and
the
taste
reveals
much
of
the
same
the
mouthfeel
isnt
quite
as
creamy
as
i
would
have
expected
but
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
o
a
bit
spendy
but
i
wasnt
disappointed
i
cant
think
of
many
delicious
barrelaged
beers
from
this
state
this
is
one
of
them
the
pour
is
dark
brown
in
color
with
a
small
khaki
head
the
aroma
starts
off
with
lots
of
roast
and
a
bit
of
coffee
bourbon
is
there
but
not
very
strong
theres
more
oak
than
bourbon
some
toffee
sweetness
with
a
bit
of
dark
chocolate
again
not
much
bourbon
flavor
but
there
is
some
oak
and
vanilla
a
bit
of
roast
and
coffee
with
a
fair
amount
of
dark
chocolate
moderate
sweetness
of
caramel
and
toffee
actually
sort
of
mellow
o
a
wonderful
beer
very
tasty
the
vanilla
comes
through
awesomely
look
for
this
beer
fremont
is
by
far
the
best
seattle
brewery
imo
poured
into
an
ommegang
flute
pours
a
very
dark
brown
appearing
black
with
red
highlights
at
the
edges
thin
fine
light
brown
head
dissipates
into
a
ring
light
lacing
aroma
is
bourbon
with
slight
hints
of
vanilla
wood
and
dark
malt
flavor
is
amazing
dark
and
caramel
malt
and
dark
fruit
and
strong
bourbon
oak
and
malt
in
the
finish
with
a
hint
of
hops
nice
heavy
viscous
body
the
bourbon
is
so
distinct
this
tastes
like
a
boilermaker
made
with
a
stout
and
bourbon
really
tastes
good
im
very
impressed
o
dang
good
brew
was
a
pleasant
surprise
for
sure
the
best
local
beer
i
have
had
just
delicious
i
cant
get
over
the
bourbony
vanilla
smell
it
was
fantastic
this
beer
should
get
fremont
noticed
a
great
beer
disappointed
they
would
only
allow
me
two
bottles
with
aging
this
should
be
a
fantastic
beer
plan
to
get
some
more
when
a
second
batch
is
released
in
feb
2011
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
bourbon
barrel
aged
beer
the
only
problem
is
that
it
is
quite
rich
which
makes
it
difficult
to
drink
a
lot
of
an
excellent
effort
by
fremont
brewing
that
is
worth
seeking
out
o
this
is
by
far
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
from
fremont
clearly
they
know
how
to
barrel
age
and
blend
as
this
is
flavorful
aromatic
and
just
flat
out
delicious
i
cant
wait
for
their
lambics
and
eventually
gueuzes
these
guys
might
be
the
only
wa
brewery
that
gives
a
shit
about
making
quality
beer
of
all
styles
keep
it
up
guys
fremont
has
a
hit
on
their
hands
this
beer
should
be
sought
out
overall
a
well
balanced
highly
drinkable
and
thoroughly
enjoyable
bourbon
barrel
aged
strong
ale
ive
been
enjoying
the
hell
out
of
this
for
the
last
two
hours
really
killer
stuff
o
great
barrel
character
not
super
rich
and
full
bit
definitely
good
sort
of
like
a
lighter
bodied
higher
carbed
less
rich
angels
share
but
for
what
it
is
it
is
plenty
rich
in
ways
it
is
similar
to
abacus

perhaps
a

this
is
a
great
beer
i
would
classify
it
as
being
closer
to
an
old
ale
than
an
american
strong
however
that
being
said
a
truly
exceptional
beer
if
you
have
the
opportunity
to
try
it
d
oh
yeah
easy
to
drink
and
a
very
good
beer
overall
drinkability
very
good
this
is
a
super
tasty
bourbon
barrel
dark
ale
that
is
smooth
as
silk
and
light
in
the
body
packing
plenty
of
flavor
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
without
realizing
what
hit
me
this
beer
is
worth
seeking
out
its
certainly
worth
the
road
trip
from
portland
to
seattle
if
youre
west
of
the
cascades
you
should
try
this
what
a
delicious
treat
the
abominable
is
a
delightful
beer
in
itself
but
this
bourbon
barrel
version
is
outstanding
a
beauteous
brown
beverage
with
ruby
highlights
like
what
a
grizzly
would
look
like
after
a
session
in
a
seattle
salon
smells
like
bourbon
and
vanilla
with
a
little
caramel
and
chocolate
this
is
a
bourbon
sandwich
it
starts
with
that
classy
bourbon
bite
before
mellowing
into
an
exceptional
winter
ale
with
the
caramel
coffee
and
chocolate
flavors
prevalent
before
giving
way
to
the
crumbling
intensity
of
the
bourbon
on
the
back
end
as
this
baby
quickly
disappears
it
leaves
vanilla
and
bourbon
heat
trickling
viciously
shouldve
gotten
a
growler
but
they
were
shorthanded
and
it
wouldve
been
selfish
to
hold
them
up
any
longer
after
their
graciousness
o
at
first
i
wasnt
too
thrilled
with
this
one
but
as
it
warms
up
it
changes
quite
a
bit
definitely
a
treat
for
hop
heads
poured
into
a
mug
thick
head
doesnt
have
a
strong
hoppy
smell
but
sure
tastes
like
a
double
ipa
with
lingering
taste
of
hops
high
abv
makes
it
absolutely
delicious
cheers
really
great
ale
maine
beer
company
has
hit
a
home
run
with
lil
one
reminds
me
of
stones
arrogant
bastard
except
its
6
ounces
less
beer
for
a
couple
of
dollars
more
good
but
theres
probably
a
cheaper
alternative
my
only
complaint
is
that
the
alcohol
is
a
bit
over
the
top
for
my
tastes
though
for
sure
thats
what
they
were
going
for
a
warming
winter
ale
my
second
favorite
now
from
mbc
right
behind
mo
like
a
hoppier
but
ultimately
less
satisfying
version
of
bigfoot
solid
but
lots
of
booze
without
the

needed
to
back
it

this
needs

the

it

could
use

for
my
tastes
as
hops
and
alcohol
dominate
but
the

are
fresh

delicious
so
ill
enjoy
the
rest
of
this
one
definitely
pick
up
a
bottle
if
you
have
the
chance
i
hope
to
see
this
come
around
more

a

mouthfeel
i
drank
this
at
the
wrong
time
i
think
either
super
fresh
when
the
hops
still
popped
or
with
more
age
to
bring
forward
more
fruit
and
subdued
hops
im
interested
enough
in
seeing
how
this
develops
that
i
may
pick
up
a
bottle
on
my
way
out
of
town
to
cellar
for
a
bit
o
was
this
beer
aged
on
wood
because
it
seems
like
it
was
a
rather
hoppy
strong
ale
one
with
the
alcohol
front
and
center
lil
one
is
worthy
of
a
world
class
rating
but
has
been
knocked
down
a
peg
by
loyalists
of
lunch
that
unfairly
compare
the
two
despite
the
distinctly
different
styles
of
a
strong
ale
and
an
ipa
mbc
stretches
the
boundaries
of
a
typical
strong
ale
by
overhopping
then
dry
hopping
and
bottle
conditioning
the
result
is
an
arse
kicking
brew
that
rocks
your
palate
and
tickles
your
hop
bone
overall
excellent
beer
surprisingly
less
intense
then
its
nose
in
a
good
way
very
heavy
bodied
piney
and
herbal
throughout
with
a
spicy
hop
bite
on
the
back
end
clean
hop
finish
with
a
touch
of
alcohol
heat
subtle
notes
of
citrus
and
caramelized
dried
fruits
faint
sweetness
with
moderate
bitterness
to
cut
it
a
little
moodiness
and
a
big
body
reminds
you
this
is
a
big
beer
which
is
nice
bold
and
mild
and
nicely
balanced
but
like
most
strong
alesbarleywines
lacks
any
form
of
drinkability
a
nice
clean
supper
like
other
maine
beers
nicely
balanced
well
blended
clean
subtle
yet
bold
and
pricey
lightly
weathered
copper
orange
in
color
with
a
heavy
haze
poured
with
a
thick
dense
beige
foam
that
reduced
to
a
thick
cap
that
left
thick
sticky
lacings
on
the
glass
sharp
citrus
grapefruit
aromas
followed
by
pine
hops
and
sticky
sweet
caramel
malt
ripe
pineapple
and
boozy
aromas
begin
to
surface
as
this
warms
along
with
intensifying
maltiness
full
bodied
with
a
thickoily
feel
and
very
soft

the
hop
flavors
are
in

of
the

with
biting
tropical

and
a
sturdy

an
excellent

strong

o
reminds
me
of
fresh

thats
a

overall
this
is
terrific
another
stellar
mbc

full

syrupy

not
bad
at
all
othis
was
the
second
beer
ive
had
from
mbc
and
was
recommended
to
try
if
i
like
sn
celebration
it
rocked
great
hops
with
some
malt
glad
i
got
the
last
one
overall
this
brew
seems
to
be
ambiguous
when
it
comes
to
style
this
beer
is
a
delight
screw
categories
if
i
had
to
classify
this
brew
the
american
style
strong
ale
fits
the
bill
this
imo
doesnt
need
a
category
to
enjoy
it
maine
beer
company
is
doing
great
things
the
aroma
alone
on
this
is
worthy
of
world
class
status
it
has
everything
you
look
for
when
a
beer
is
hella
dryhopped
i
hope
that
this
beer
isnt
on
brewed
once
status
this
brew
is
recommended
another
win
from
maine
beer
company
o
not
sure
about
how
this
is
fresh
but
after
a
year
of
aging
this
takes
on
a
barleywine
character
which
works
pretty
well
quite
well
balanced
and
very
drinkable
almost
scary
drinkable
reminds
me
a
bit
of
southern
tiers
backburner
quite
good
o
one
of
my
favorites
from
maine
beer
company
i
will
definitely
have
again
they
brew
some
really
good
brew
o
a
fantastic
double
ipa
nothing
groundbreaking
but
easily
peer
with
beers
of
this
sort
relatively
balanced
between
thick
malt
and
bitter
pine
hop
not
a
beer
youre
gonna
confuse
with
an
ipa
or
a
barleywine
nothing
borderline
about
it
gotta
pick
one
up
if
you
spot
it
assuming
you
like
dipas
that
is
this
is
a
pretty
solid
and
hoppy
strong
ale
it
almost
comes
across
as
a
reverse
dipa
a
ton
of
hops
present
primarily
to
keep
it
from
becoming
a
malt
bomb
theres
tons
of
flavor
to
go
around
and
its
definitely
tasty
o
a
hoppy
yet
balanced
brew
for
sure
very
similar
to
a
hoppy
amber
like
zoe
but
still
different
enough
definitely
a
heavier
malt
presence
for
sure
the
style
reminds
me
of
arrogant
bastard
though
it
is
quite
a
different
hop
and
malt
profile
really
tasty
and
easy
drinking
brew
very
nice
o
this
is
quite
a
hefty
beer
the
flavor
profile
reminds
me
very
much
of
celebration
but
with
the
gravity
amped
up
the
abv
is
high
to
tank
this
one
when
youre
feeling
good
its
enough
to
make
you
sing
yeah
and
open
another
look
out
for
this
one
quite
a
nice
winter
beer
o
the
flavor
profile
of
this
beer
reminded
me
a
lot
of
firestone
walker
double
jack
i
would
say
that
double
jack
is
a
lot
smoother
and
would
be
my
preference
of
these
two
beers
still
this
is
a
beer
worth
trying
and
another
great
product
by
the
maine
beer
company
this
is
a
good
offering
from
maine
beer
in
retrospect
i
probably
should
have
drank
it
sooner
but
the
hops
mostly
held
up
and
they
are
good
i
would
say
that
the
malts
are
a
bit
too
earthy
and
cooked
but
i
suppose
that
is
to
fit
the
style
worth
a
try
great
creamy
hoppy
beer
their
signature
style
turned
up
a
notch
very
lacy
dipa
strength
drunk
exactly
90
days
after
bottling
bottle
from
capones
big
ibu
without
major
palate
erasing
good
drinkability
fuller
mouthfeel
citrus
orange
aroma
and
flavour
oan
interesting
beer
not
sure
what
to
make
of
this
but
pleasant
enough
to
sip
and
enjoy
o
unique
a
tasty
treat
that
i
will
look
to
revisit
next
winter
thanks
to
drewshal9
for
the
trade
a
fairly
strong
and
good
looking
brew
medium
body
decent
carbonation
sticky
and
chewy
on
the
tongue
drinks
nicely
considering
the
abv
meshing
nicely
with
the
hopforward
profile
another
solid
beer
albeit
a
bit
ugly
looking
from
mbc
but
not
one
of
their
top
creations
comes
across
like
a
borderline
double
ipa
bitter
from
the
ample
peppery
hop
solid
pale
malt
base
but
the
tale
is
of
the
hop
the
alcohol
is
present
but
well
blended
the
aftertaste
does
not
linger
as
long
as
the
bitterness
would
suggest
smooth
body
o
aweso
beer
great
flavor
no
alcohol
very
fangerous
at

overall
disappointing
maine
beer
im
just
not
getting
it
if
you
are
a
hophead
then
this
is
a
dream
it
doesnt
really
fit
the
style
but
it
is
a
very
tasty
beer
nonetheless
o
a
dipa
in
sheeps
clothing
maine
beers
lil
one
is
a
9
1
abv
hop
bomb
with
a
little
more
malt
complexity
than
your
average
shock
and
awe
big
bitter
ipa
the
american
strong
ale
catchall
category
allows
this
beer
to
be
as
big
fresh
and
hoppy
as
it
wants
to
be
while
offering
a
bit
more
fruity
complexity
even
though
its
nuances
are
crushed
by
bitter
hops
a
pretty
good
example
of
the
style
and
certainly
a
beer
for
hopheads
to
try
o
a
decent
beer
but
the
flavors
dont
really
meld
that
well
definitely
clean
but
too
earthy
for
me
a
resiny
hop
bomb
from
me
beer
go
figure
while
this
is
indubitably
a
good
beer
i
dont
know
that
it
stands
out
from
any
of
the
other
me
beer
hop
bombs
probably
my
least
favorite
of
that
trio
zoe
peeper
and
lunch
i
guess
you
could
count
mo
too
due
to
the
thick
dessert
like
malt
character
but
thats
just
my
preference
that
being
said
somebody
get
me
another
one
overall
this
is
a
delicious
brew
im
not
going
to
try
to
categorize
this
because
it
covers
a
multitude
of
styles
it
could
be
a
dipa
an
imperial
red
or
a
strong
as
the
description
up
top
says
regardless
its
a
bit
hop
forward
but
as
i
keep
drinking
the
malts
seem
to
come
through
the
more
i
drink
this
the
more
it
shines
good
stuff
maine
beer
co
the
consistency
of
this
brewing
company
is
awesome
i
have
yet
to
have
a
beer
worthy
of
a
total
score
under
4
o
another
winner
from
maine
brewing
we
just
got
them
in
the
dc
area
and
theyve
yet
to
disappoint
taste
reminds
me
more
of
an
east
coast
malt
heavy
dipa
sort
of
like
stone
coasts
triple
ipa
was
like
grapefruit
citrus
hops
upfront
with
a
interesting
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
likely
from
some
spicy
rye
character
caramel
malt
quickly
comes
in
to
smooth
things
over
so
not
to
be
too
onesided
very
thick
and
full
bodied
with
a
proper
carbonation
level
that
provides
a
nice
creaminess
alcohol
is
pretty
well
hidden
but
this
is
still
a
sipper
because
of
the
heaviness
of
this
beer
on
the
fuller
end
of
medium
bodied
with
a
blast
of
sticky
earthy
hops
that
provide
a
ton
of
dry
bitterness
that
lingers
over
the
leathery
and
sweet
malt
notes
into
a
bone
dry
finish
the
hop
profile
is
one
dimensional
with
very
bitter
tongue
coating
dryness
that
is
a
bit
overwhelming
dirty
and
soil
like
with
a
ton
of
grass
and
pine
flavor
countered
by
spicy
rye
leather
toffee
and
subtle
vinous
fruit
the
caramel
malt
sweetness
and
vinous
dark
fruit
notes
found
in
the
aroma
are
almost
completely
overpowered
the
high
abv
is
well
masked
with
only
a
touch
of
heat
and
alcohol
sweetness
but
this
beer
is
still
tough
to
drink
and
is
in
desperate
need
of
some
balance
not
a
bad
beer
but
it
lacks
complexity
and
drinking
all
16
9oz
was
a
bit
of
a
chore
im
doin
this
guy
with
a
jelly
doughnutwouldnt
you
though
its
working
out
pretty
well
the
super
sweet
and
bright
jelly
rocks
the
shit
out
of
the
fatty
bitter
profile
into
a
pushpull
bonanza
for
a
hibernation
treat
id
also
however
go
beefrabbit
stew
pot
roast
with
parsnips
and
carrots
spicysausagetopped
pizza
indian
and
other
super
sweet
fruit
based
desserts
and
a
shot
of
whiskey
would
make
this
baby
shine
m
its
a
big
medium
actually
somewhat
chewy
although
it
doesnt
look
that
way
o
im
not
really
digging
this
the
hop
character
clashes
with
the
malty
strength
of
the
base
beer
the
mouthfeel
isnt
as
substantial
as
i
would
like
it
to
be
and
the
collection
of
flavors
is
extremely
muddled
first
miss
by
a
stellar
brewery
in
my
opinion
d
a
big
guy
for
sure
the
hops
starts
things
off
in
an
awesome
way
especially
on
the
nose
however
after
a
few
sips
more
and
more
grain
comes
through
until
a
balance
is
reached
sticky
rich
woody
big
memory
brings
me
back
to
stones
arrogant
bastard
its
not
necessarily
bad
but
confusing
i
would
definitely
recommend
the
other
maine
co
beers
they
make
some
of
the
best
beers
i
have
had
each
and
every
one
this
is
an
outlier
for
me
overall
this
beer
has
many
attributes
of
an
excellent
beer
actually
it
has
many
attributes
of
several
excellent
beers
that
dont
necessarily
belong
together
either
make
a
barleywine
or
an
ipa
or
do
something
totally
different
and
make
a
strong
ale
as
it
stands
its
tasty
but
could
be
so
much
more
if
they
went
one
way
or
the
other
taste
is
sweet
malts
a
bit
of
citurs
maybe
with
nice
hop
flavor
without
much
bitterness
its
a
bit
hot
but
creamy
and
pleasant
nice
winter
brew
and
great
new
addition
to
the
mbc
line
up
i
like
this
as
a
strong
ale
the
aroma
leads
one
to
think
this
will
be
a
full
on
dipa
but
the
caramel
malts
really
kick
strong
in
accompaniment
o
i
really
thought
this
was
going
to
be
a
dainty
pale
ale
when
i
picked
it
up
still
not
really
one
that
id
age
and
they
say
not
to
on
the
label
but
it
would
be
interesting
to
experiment
if
i
came
across
it
again
o
damn
i
love
maine
beer
cos
beers
usually
great
hop
taste
and
very
balanced
this
one
did
not
do
it
for
me
it
was
bottled
on
12313
and
drank
within
30
days
of
bottling
so
it
was
definitely
fresh
but
i
was
not
a
fan
of
the
hop
profile
on
this
one
huge
disappointment
i
had
been
drinking
a
few
other
hoppy
beers
today
so
maybe
i
had
some
palate
fatigue
but
this
one
was
rough
o
a
lot
of
people
have
been
calling
this
a
double
ipa
id
say
its
more
along
the
lines
of
an
imperial
red
nobody
likes
calling
it
a
strong
ale
i
guess
its
kind
of
a
copout
no
matter
what
you
decide
to
call
it
this
is
an
excellent
beer
it
features
one
of
the
more
memorable
hop
profiles
ive
come
across
in
a
while
and
it
drinks
far
too
easily
to
be
9
1
abv
maine
beer
co
will
have
to
get
lil
one
to
market
in
greater
numbers
next
year
this
is
one
beer
that
people
will
be
clamoring
for
once
word
gets
out
the
hops
here
seem
to
be
just
a
bit
off
for
me
they
arent
bad
by
any
means
but
they
dont
jump
out
at
me
and
take
over
the
beer
as
i
expected
them
too
that
would
be
fine
but
the
malt
doesnt
really
take
control
either
i
guess
the
beer
falls
into
an
odd
space
for
me
the
hops
arent
big
enough
for
to
be
a
dipa
but
the
malt
is
too
much
to
make
a
regular
ipahoppy
red
neither
seem
big
enough
to
make
it
a
strong
alebarleywine
so
its
a
bit
tough
to
categorize
o
this
was
another
great
hoppy
beer
from
mbc
the
abv
was
extremely
well
hidden
and
the
beer
was
very
nicely
balanced
maybe
not
my
favorite
in
their
lineup
but
definitely
something
i
would
like
to
try
again
and
worth
seeking
out
at
the
89
price
tag
for
a
500ml
bottle
im
not
sure
how
often
i
will
be
drinking
this
in
the
future
even
if
they
make
it
readily
available
i
definitely
recommend
at
least
checking
it
out
though
bottled
on
131
poured
on
210
really
surprised
at
this
great
ale
poured
a
lovely
bright
amber
great
floralcitrus
nose
that
you
find
in
the
best
dipas
which
this
beer
reminded
me
more
of
than
the
booziermaltier
profile
of
an
american
strong
contained
a
unique
sweetness
that
reminded
me
of
watermelon
hop
forward
but
not
a
bomb
overall
a
solid
balance
extremely
drinkable
for
the
abv
a
real
exceptional
beer
from
mbc
the
beer
pours
an
odd
and
ruddy
redcandied
brown
with
slight
hints
of
orange
the
head
is
nicely
sized
and
colored
almost
a
sand
dune
white
the
beers
body
is
murky
but
not
dense
with
a
nice
clouding
while
the
beers
lacing
is
light
and
stringy
on
the
glass
leaving
a
few
strands
on
the
nose
the
beer
smells
of
big
piney
hops
with
just
a
touch
of
fruity
mango
and
onion
the
malt
sits
below
the
hops
as
a
very
light
caramelly
touch
mixed
with
some
lovely
breadiness
that
blends
beautifully
with
the
piney
hops
on
the
tongue
the
beer
tastes
rather
straight
forward
with
big
grapefruit
and
pine
bitters
with
a
touch
of
sweet
malts
which
lead
me
to
think
of
ruby
red
grapefruit
juice
this
taste
is
sadly
subdued
for
what
i
was
hoping
the
beer
begins
with
bitter
aspirin
which
quickly
opens
into
grapefruit
melding
with
light
sweet
malts
that
bring
big
ruby
red
grapefruit
flavors
to
the
mouth
the
finish
is
strong
with
grapefruit
and
pine
and
a
big
rush
of
alcoholic
heat
though
no
alcoholic
flavors
are
present
at
all
the
aftertaste
rings
nicely
with
light
pine
and
some
sweet
caramel
malt
on
the
mouth
the
beer
feels
medium
in
body
with
a
little
bit
of
heaviness
on
the
tongue
the
beer
is
smooth
and
creamy
with
a
nice
crispness
to
it
that
does
leave
me
feeling
slightly
refreshed
the
mouth
is
left
slightly
damp
with
only
a
ghost
of
the
dryness
coming
off
from
the
hops
overall
this
beer
is
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
it
is
not
a
horrible
beer
but
it
really
doesnt
have
the
complexity
of
other
maine
beer
company
beers
it
reminds
me
of
celebration
only
with
more
heat
in
the
finish
which
is
nice
i
guess
but
not
worth
the
9
i
paid
for
it
the
beer
really
just
feels
like
a
double
ipa
to
me
as
i
am
really
not
getting
enough
of
the
malt
from
it
the
beer
is
simple
and
tasty
but
i
was
hoping
for
so
much
more
and
it
just
did
not
deliver
this
beer
is
good
but
i
wouldnt
try
it
for
its
price
point
overall
this
is
the
best
ive
had
from
maine
beer
yet
this
is
a
near
perfect
iipa
o
hops
are
super
fresh
this
is
super
tasty
drink
this
as
soon
as
you
find
it
lots
of
hops
in
this
beer
definitely
drink
it
fresh
very
tasty
o
apparently
this
is
their
new
winter
beer
at
least
according
to
the
back
of
the
label
nicely
balanced
and
way
too
easy
to
drink
given
the
9
1
definitely
looking
forward
to
either
getting
more
this
year
or
stocking
up
next
winter
when
its
brewed
again
as
with
nearly
all
of
mbcs
brews
drink
this
one
fresh
this
is
a
much
bigger
beer
than
anything
mbc
has
done
and
i
think
they
mostly
succeeded
personally
id
like
to
taste
a
little
more
of
the
malts
what
this
beer
does
do
very
well
is
masking
its
high
abv
there
are
no
extra
unfermented
sugars
here
the
small
batch
size
of
this
beer
makes
me
think
it
will
be
a
while
before
i
have
it
again
but
it
appears
on
the
shelves
again
next
winter
i
would
buy
a
bottle
wonderful
a
small
hint
of
brown
sugar
this
is
a
smooth
beer
that
prances
all
over
your
tongue
these
can
sneak
up
on
you
quick
drink
slow
and
enjoy
the
lace
beautiful
amber
color
deliciously
sweet
and
hoppy
different
but
good
balance
slightly
boozy
nose
sweet
on
the
tongue
and
finishes
with
just
a
hint
of
bitterness
o
3
75
this
beer
looks
great
in
a
glass
it
leaves
tremendous
lacing
as
it
is
enjoyed
the
nose
is
just
weak
i
cant
zero
in
on
anything
to
hold
on
to
the
flavor
is
sweet
and
delicious
not
like
other
beers
that
i
can
think
of
this
might
be
a
nice
dessert
beer
typically
a
role
filled
by
stouts
i
cant
imagine
drinking
more
than
12
of
these
at
a
time
there
is
a
lot
of
sweetness
happening
it
might
pile
up
beautiful
reddish
amber
roasted
malt
pepper
and
fruit
on
the
news
the
taste
is
much
the
same
with
lots
of
sweetness
and
alcoholic
bite
its
great
id
get
it
again
retrospect
maybe
its
the
slightly
sweetcumboozy
undertone
that
makes
people
go
nuts
for
it
i
dont
know
i
couldnt
get
into
it
one
of
the
best
tasting
beers
ive
had
this
used
to
be
one
of
my
favorite
beers
there
was
the
mystery
of
them
stopping
production
for
a
few
years
maybe
it
was
just
too
good
why
anybody
stops
making
a
successful
beer
needs
an
answer
its
just
unfortunate
it
seems
to
be
lost
forever
from
the
12
oz
bottle
in
a
six
pack
tha
has
been
tough
to
get
through
but
when
you
need
a
bedtime
beer
with
the
right
punch
you
can
overlook
the
taste
sweet
smell
crisp
bitter
taste
this
is
a
real
winner
just
a
touch
of
mediciney
aftertaste
deters
from
an
otherwise
pretty
nice
beer
wonderful
beer
perfect
amount
of
sweetness
i
will
be
buying
this
again
for
sure
strong
and
super
tasty
excellent
brew
im
probably
giving
in
to
the
marketing
too
much
but
i
swear
that
i
can
catch
the
faint
essence
of
brown
sugar
this
beer
certainly
paired
well
with
baked
ham
and
potatoes
for
a
classic
sunday
dinner
with
the
family
the
malt
flavor
is
still
there
but
the
lagunitas
hops
run
the
show
while
the
malt
compliments
the
hops
easily
drinkable
at
9
9
percent
and
a
fantastic
beer
great
dessert
beer
on
its
own
or
pared
with
something
beautiful
colour
and
very
nice
nose
taste
is
a
little
too
malty
for
my
taste
but
it
masks
the
high
abv
pretty
well
nice
sweet
caramel
flavour
lagunitas
just
make
great
beers
no
matter
style
would
seek
out
and
purchase
again
this
is
a
ing
great
beer
i
think
its
a
little
too
sweet
for
a
dinner
but
great
after
a
good
meal
skip
the
desert
overall
its
fairly
difficult
to
classify
this
beer
doesnt
really
come
off
like
a
typical
american
barleywine
but
its
very
good
it
has
been
several
years
since
i
have
had
this
beer
it
is
pretty
darn
good
i
actually
pretty
much
like
all
lagunitas
beers
but
i
typically
buy
ohio
and
michigan
beers
since
im
a
homer
hoppier
than
expected
for
something
called
brown
shugga
guess
i
expected
something
sweet
and
maltier
still
good
o
very
nice
balance
between
tastes
and
aromatics
o
a
nice
blend
of
bitter
and
sweet
a
solid
beer
from
a
solid
brewery
a
very
good
beer
that
firing
on
all
cylinders
o
big
rich
sticky
sweet
and
delicious
rarely
do
i
buy
a
6ers
but
in
this
case
it
was
a
very
wise
investment
the
more
i
drink
it
the
more
i
love
it
it
is
a
decent
beer
this
one
is
rich
in
feel
which
is
fitting
since
ive
just
recently
polished
off
a
paczki
a
rich
donutlike
fruit
or
cream
filled
pastry
eaten
on
fat
tuesday
sip
this
one
savor
it
pours
nice
dark
copper
color
with
thick
long
lasting
head
very
aromatic
smell
decent
taste
overall
ok
beer
o
this
definitely
falls
between
an
american
barleywine
and
a
double
ipa
nice
malt
and
hop
presence
at
first
taste
i
thought
this
was
a
unique
and
complex
beer
but
when
it
was
finished
i
dont
really
know
where
to
go
with
this
one
the
nose
and
taste
starts
with
carmalized
citrus
and
ends
dry
and
hoppy
with
an
alcohol
bite
its
a
mix
between
an
ipa
and
a
barley
wine
and
i
dont
think
it
pulls
off
that
balance
in
the
end
im
glad
i
was
able
to
try
it
poured
a
solid
dark
amber
with
a
slight
foamy
offwhite
head
smell
is
sweet
and
hoppy
brown
sugar
caramel
honey
beautiful
taste
is
also
sweet
with
a
relatively
mild
kick
considering
its
9
9
abv
i
honestly
cant
believe
it
has
a
9
9
abv
this
is
a
very
easy
beer
to
drink
one
of
the
most
impressive
beers
ive
had
in
a
very
long
time
crystal
clear
bready
harmonious
caramelbrown
sugar
and
hops
with
perfect
notoverthe
top
stickiness
to
compliment
its
flavor
profile
i
love
savoring
this
beer
and
letting
the
hops
build
up
sip
after
sip
may
not
be
for
everyone
but
the
fresher
the
better
in
my
book
a
nice
solid
ale
with
flavors
of
honey
brown
sugar
malt
and
a
beautiful
spicy
and
earthy
hop
feel
the
aroma
is
that
of
flowers
and
sweet
caramel
candy
love
this
beer
fresh
starts
getting
really
interesting
with
a
little
age
too
o
this
is
one
of
the
better
strong
ales
ive
enjoyed
handles
the
combination
of
bitterness
and
sweetness
well
making
it
a
pleasure
to
drink
with
a
10
abv
this
is
one
that
im
glad
comes
as
a
12
oz
wish
more
beers
did
excellent
o
i
love
this
beer
kinda
taste
little
like
stone
ipa
but
100
times
better
and
it
has
brown
sugar
come
on
who
dont
love
brown
shugga
i
dont
know
if
its
age
undiagnosed
brain
damage
or
happenstance
but
this
is
the
second
beer
in
a
row
that
tastes
nothing
like
the
prior
incarnation
i
recall
from
years
prior
i
remember
this
as
a
sweet
brown
brew
you
know
kinda
like
the
name
brown
shugga
would
suggest
not
the
amber
hop
bomb
i
have
before
me
as
far
as
a
pale
ale
goes
this
isnt
half
bad
but
its
not
at
all
what
i
was
expecting
o
even
after
a
year
is
beer
is
still
intense
tastes
like
a
hoppier
and
less
thick
barleywine
i
preferred
this
over
the
fresh
bottles
and
i
believe
this
will
hold
up
for
even
more
years
in
the
cellar
on
tap
in
tulip
glass
appearance
deep
amber
color
slight
white
head
leaves
some
lacing
on
the
glass
some
carbonation
evident
aroma
caramel
rich
barley
malt
syrup
earthy
and
citrus
hops
and
a
slight
yeasty
funk
mouthfeel
medium
bodied
silky
mouthfeel
with
some
alcohol
warming
in
the
throat
flavor
brown
sugar
caramel
cookie
dough
bread
crust
and
moderate
hop
bitterness
overall
well
done
for
easy
sipping
on
a
cold
winter
night
brew
pours
a
beautiful
copper
in
color
with
a
good
2finger
foamy
offwhite
head
a
decent
amount
of
ringlacing
was
seen
when
sipped
that
stuck
to
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
burnt
brown
sugar
and
yeast
for
the
most
part
lots
going
on
with
the
taste
than
the
nose
would
have
you
think
as
there
is
some
caramel
pine
hops
with
a
hint
of
dark
fruits
great
taste
but
has
a
slight
bitter
hoppy
finish
that
lasted
a
bit
too
long
for
my
liking
you
cant
taste
the
alcohol
at
all
which
is
strange
since
it
is
so
close
to
10
has
a
great
flavor
but
that
bitterhop
finish
kind
of
ruined
it
for
me
mediumbodied
with
perfect
carbonation
yummy
no
complaints
this
is
a
great
beer
hoppy
malty
and
just
makes
you
feel
good
o
completely
solid
tasty
beer
very
drinkable
for
10
yet
very
nice
as
a
sipping
beer
too
not
super
interesting
but
it
does
have
some
complexity
to
it
for
sure
i
would
completely
recommend
this
beer
this
is
a
potent
brew
that
is
usually
a
one
and
done
for
me
worth
trying
but
not
something
i
will
seek
out
in
the
future
it
was
alright
nice
strong
ale
tasty
but
i
couldnt
drink
more
than
one
at
a
time
just
not
my
style
of
beer
overall
i
wouldnt
really
consider
this
a
brown
ale
dfh
90
minute
ipa
seems
to
have
just
as
much
if
not
more
malt
in
it
as
this
this
is
just
a
dipa
on
the
maltier
side
with
that
being
said
id
consider
this
and
90
minute
the
best
beers
in
that
regard
and
perhaps
even
great
divide
herculese
all
are
great
examples
of
a
malty
ipa
done
right
this
one
has
a
great
balance
between
bitter
hops
and
sweet
malt
and
goes
down
extremely
smooth
especially
considering
the
abv
id
rather
go
for
a
lil
sumpin
sumpin
hop
stoopid
or
sucks
but
as
far
as
a
malty
ipa
goes
this
is
a
winner
o
i
knew
nothing
about
this
brew
before
i
tried
it
so
it
was
a
bit
of
a
surprise
but
a
good
surprise
dank
hoppy
and
enjoyable
overall
a
very
enjoyable
beer
with
a
complex
flavor
profile
that
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
o
great
beer
will
have
again
perfect
balance
of
sweet
bitter
hoppy
citrus
and
high
abv
a
great
brown
ale
for
ipapale
ale
pallets
love
the
golden
brown
color
not
a
true
brown
but
a
nice
looking
beer
nose
is
malty
with
a
hint
of
pine
pours
a
big
bubble
head
that
fades
fast
but
leaves
a
nice
lace
probably
my
favorite
brown
ale
but
im
not
a
connoisseur
of
the
style
i
typically
avoid
sweeter
beers
a
little
sweet
and
boozy
for
my
taste
interesting
enough
but
dont
care
to
drink
another
anytime
soon
with
its
sparklinglyclean
caramel
color
brown
shugga
is
really
a
brew
of
rare
breed
heavy
and
strong
clean
and
shiny
balanced
and
smooth
a
bit
woody
and
benevolently
saccharine
big
but
also
blithely
selfassured
indeed
the
brewers
belief
that
this
special
ale
is
something
unique
seems
anything
but
misplaced
for
hoppy
beer
fans
youll
love
this
the
sugar
doesnt
quite
come
to
the
fore
like
id
hoped
but
the
look
is
beautiful
nice
creamy
foam
after
pouring
leaving
lacing
as
it
falls
and
taste
is
decently
complex
with
floral
and
fruity
notes
the
finish
is
bitter
overall
damn
this
is
a
great
beer
i
love
the
balance
between
hops
and
sweet
lagunitas
you
knocked
it
out
of
the
park
with
this
one
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
end
of
sentence
to
me
it
tastes
like
a
sweet
double
bastard
good
beer
though
strong
too
at
9
99
abv
oa
fascinating
beer
with
a
unique
combination
of
hops
malt
sugar
the
malt
presence
becomes
apparent
first
the
sweetness
comes
through
next
and
then
it
finishes
with
a
hop
bitterness
love
the
complexity
of
flavor
along
with
a
little
kick
but
not
a
strong
alcohol
taste
well
made
quality
beer
at
a
bargain
price
awesome
beer
with
name
thought
it
might
lean
to
sweet
but
surprised
that
had
decent
hops
great
seasonal
beer
and
thankful
i
bought
last
6er
today
really
nice
look
and
smooth
overal
this
is
a
fantastic
strong
ale
and
so
different
with
that
brown
sugar
not
to
into
this
one
the
taste
is
strong
not
my
drink
transparent
red
color
sweet
malty
smell
with
some
hops
sweet
booze
hops
on
the
taste
good
medium
body
yummy
on
tap
at
city
taphouse
in
philly
strong
piney
finish
i
am
not
convinced
that
the
shugga
and
the
hops
balance
one
another
reminds
me
of
120
ipa
a
lot
dissapointing
beer
in
my
opinion
sweeter
than
i
imagined
hmmm
usually
not
a
fan
of
sweet
but
this
is
an
exception
to
that
when
i
had
it
the
second
time
cause
i
forgot
i
tried
it
it
was
a
different
beer
leading
me
to
believe
that
scottys
brew
house
had
a
bad
keg
i
dont
know
if
i
am
drinking
the
same
beer
as
some
people
i
was
not
sold
on
this
one
good
feel
to
the
beer
and
nice
light
carbonation
as
others
have
pointed
out
however
that
was
about
it
for
me
didnt
smell
good
too
sweet
on
the
front
and
the
after
taste
is
as
if
someone
poured
cheap
vodka
in
my
beer
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
medium
bodied
and
has
a
nice
drinkable
feel
to
it
there
is
a
nice
smoothness
that
has
a
great
silky
feel
no
i
would
not
buy
again
i
have
to
say
if
i
set
out
to
get
drunk
off
of
some
good
beer
this
would
be
a
good
starting
point
solid
all
around
warms
me
up
taste
of
brown
sugar
better
than
sucks
to
me
powerful
stuff
strong
appealing
bitter
taste
taste
strong
and
very
much
a
heavilyhopped
ale
yet
the
brown
sugar
steers
this
one
somewhere
different
and
away
from
the
usual
imperial
ipa
territory
where
this
would
be
firmly
categorized
as
if
not
for
this
surprising
infusion
theres
a
bitterness
present
but
also
plenty
of
toasty
sweet
maltiness
and
a
dry
warming
finish
as
well
a
unique
heavy
and
thoroughly
enjoyable
experience
poured
from
bottle
big
frothy
head
definitely
sweet
a
little
balance
from
the
hops
but
the
added
sugar
dominates
a
little
peppery
bite
from
the
alcohol
but
went
down
easy
for
9
9
very
good
beer
from
lagunitas
strong
taste
the
name
solid
sippin
brew
overall
essentially
outside
of
maryland
offerings
my
first
foray
into
craft
beer
and
im
really
pleased
with
this
this
is
the
first
of
a
sixer
and
im
certainly
looking
forward
to
the
rest
another
good
one
from
lagunitas
i
was
disappointed
with
this
brew
with
all
of
the
talk
about
brown
sugar
and
such
i
thought
this
beer
would
be
sweeter
and
have
a
richer
malty
taste
instead
i
got
practically
an
ipa
its
not
a
terrible
beer
but
overall
was
not
a
fan
of
the
flavor
was
not
what
i
was
expecting
maybe
the
smell
was
so
awesome
that
the
taste
couldnt
compete
like
smelling
a
flower
and
its
awesome
yet
eating
it
not
so
good
hope
that
made
sense
im
definitely
going
to
have
another
and
review
it
once
again
was
still
very
complex
with
tons
of
tastes
that
i
loved
had
this
on
tap
saturday
and
now
im
certain
the
bottles
i
had
before
were
bad
much
better
this
time
around
overall
it
was
good
just
had
a
slightly
lighter
body
and
heavier
alcohol
flavor
than
i
expected
this
beer
was
not
what
i
expected
it
was
given
to
me
and
i
was
just
going
off
the
name
without
reading
any
of
the
label
but
the
name
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
a
brown
ale
it
poured
into
a
pint
glass
with
a
beautiful
copper
color
and
the
fluffy
creamy
white
head
immediately
came
to
life
and
stayed
it
left
quite
a
bit
of
lacing
with
each
sip
boy
what
a
nice
looking
ale
when
i
smelled
it
the
hops
drifted
up
but
not
too
strong
with
some
nice
malts
to
blend
in
the
taste
was
just
wonderful
the
fact
that
i
was
completely
caught
off
guard
with
the
type
of
beer
this
was
really
enhanced
the
favors
for
me
no
preconceived
notions
the
hops
was
right
up
front
but
not
too
strong
think
of
a
mild
ipa
the
malts
were
just
right
but
what
knocked
it
out
of
the
park
for
me
was
the
sweet
flavors
then
i
read
the
label
brown
cane
sugar
it
really
works
well
with
the
malty
flavors
to
produce
what
has
become
a
new
favorite
of
mine
it
was
not
overly
carbonated
nor
to
thin
it
was
just
right
for
me
while
the
sweetness
of
the
cane
sugar
may
be
too
much
for
some
this
is
one
ale
you
should
try
i
was
also
very
surprised
to
see
that
it
had
a
9
99
abv
it
completely
disappears
into
what
i
think
is
an
excellenty
crafted
ale
kudos
lagunitas
wn
sugar
note
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
smooth
overall
a
pretty
good
winter
beer
tried
this
again
still
a
little
cloying
but
has
excellent
hop
profile
my
first
single
bottle
i
tried
most
have
been
too
old
cheers
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
would
gladly
drink
it
again
it
was
an
easy
to
drink
beer
with
a
unique
flavor
but
not
something
that
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
for
i
think
the
hype
surrounding
this
beer
might
have
left
me
disappointed
though
a
very
nice
beer
none
the
less
great
hoppy
smell
and
look
but
tastes
pretty
sweet
with
a
very
noticeable
alcohol
taste
lagunitas
sucks
is
a
lot
better
you
can
taste
a
faint
hint
of
burnt
sugar
upfront
but
it
gives
way
nicely
to
a
medium
malt
hop
exchange
a
little
piney
on
the
back
at
first
but
mellows
as
it
warms
just
sweet
enough
to
add
dimension
but
not
sugary
i
will
give
this
a
higher
rating
because
i
can
see
why
people
like
it
it
does
have
a
depth
of
flavor
and
is
somewhat
unique
however
i
did
not
care
for
it
as
it
was
to
bitter
for
me
deep
red
mahogany
color
pine
alcohol
and
cooked
sugar
aroma
translates
into
similar
flavors
somehow
masking
the
alcohol
somewhat
syrupy
and
smooth
feel
makes
this
surprisingly
drinkable
a
bit
dangerous
at
10
goes
down
way
too
easy
typical
lagunitas
style
beer
which
means
well
made
this
is
a
sweet
beer
so
be
prepared
high
abv
noticeable
but
blends
well
recommend
letting
it
sit
to
room
temp
which
improves
smooth
mouth
feel
strong
caramel
alcohol
laced
aroma
the
sweet
alcohol
taste
takes
over
the
malt
and
hops
but
not
too
hoppy
two
stage
beer
first
the
overall
beer
flavors
followed
by
heavy
brown
shugga
that
lingers
in
the
back
of
the
mouth
and
tongue
love
this
beer
a
nice
hop
flavor
in
a
dark
brown
ale
it
was
a
lil
better
last
year
but
still
very
tasty
it
was
pretty
hard
to
believe
this
beer
was
nearly
10
abv
as
it
drinks
very
easily
has
a
very
interested
balance
of
malty
sweetness
and
west
coast
hops
a
must
try
overall
beautiful
appearance
sort
of
a
cross
between
an
imperial
ipa
and
an
american
barley
wine
unique
and
wroth
trying
beautiful
lacing
tulip
and
pleasantly
aromatic
warm
almost
rummy
alcohol
finish
drinks
very
well
considering
the
10
abv
i
will
go
back
to
this
time
and
again
well
done
no
balance
no
shugga
taste
tasted
like
alcohol
and
nothing
more
using
a
belgian
yeast
like
in
sumpin
wild
overall
not
what
i
was
expecting
but
it
was
a
very
good
an
enjoyable
beer
wish
it
was
just
a
bit
stronger
on
the
brown
sugar
character
overall
i
really
did
like
the
fresh
hop
character
in
the
nose
and
im
really
a
fan
of
more
malt
forward
beers
not
a
hop
head
like
some
craft
beer
connoisseurs
i
also
really
like
that
this
beer
comes
in
a
six
pack
it
gives
me
a
chance
to
try
it
over
the
next
few
months
to
see
the
hop
character
fade
and
the
brown
sugar
maltiness
come
to
the
forward
i
dont
think
it
was
a
very
expensive
6pack
either
1213
i
think
that
is
an
excellent
value
for
money
when
you
consider
that
this
is
the
better
part
of
10
alcohol
the
use
of
cheap
brown
sugar
instead
of
the
more
expensive
malted
barley
great
job
lagunitas

beautiful
deep

with
a
hefty
2

nice
lacing
on
the
glass
as
the

dissipates
smells
hoppy
like
an
ipa
but
without
as
much
citrus
im
getting
mostly
brown
sugar
and
hops
mouthfeel
is
bitter
and
dry
definite
alcohol
warmth
and
a
numbing
mouthfeel
as
beer
warms
overall
looks
can
be
deceiving
expected
something
more
with
this
one
but
certainly
worth
the
2
from
a
local
ohio
grocer
served
in
a
goblet
from
draft
definitely
lagunitas
with
the
intense
aroma
thick
mouthfeel
and
good
lasting
roasty
taste
not
dry
or
sweet
good
new
age
style
interpretation
going
to
rate
this
better
than
average
but
with
the
caveat
that
i
didnt
care
for
it
there
is
a
hop
bitterness
that
cuts
through
the
sweetness
that
i
am
not
able
to
stand

to
balance
things
out
really
nice

pretty
easy

albeit
with
some
hot

notes
overall
this
brew
is
a
hard
to
miss
for
the
winter
time
for
sure
a
best
bang
for
your
buck
beer
when
it
comes
to
hoppy
strong
beers
that
you
can
get
almost
anywhere
i
was
looking
forward
to
this
one
and
afterwards
i
am
kind
of
meh
about
it
i
like
hop
bitterness
in
my
beer
but
this
has
an
odd
bitter
note
at
the
end
that
i
did
not
like
i
tried
two
and
gave
the
rest
of
the
six
pack
a
good
home
with
a
friend
who
likes
this
style
beer
more
than
me
this
is
the
first
american
strong
ale
i
have
rated
i
dont
know
what
to
make
of
this
style
in
the
sense
that
it
feels
like
an
ipa
to
me
i
would
like
to
rate
other
examples
of
this
style
to
compare
nevertheless
im
impressed
by
this
one
it
is
quite
intense
and
the
high
abv
gives
you
quite
the
pleasant
buzz
good
beer
missing
a
bit
more
sweetness
but
overall
solid
huge
head
nice
balance
between
pine
and
molassesy
malt
fantastic
winter
brew
bitter
burnt
sugar
notes
throughout
o
an
enjoyable
beer
but
i
would
prefer
a
little
less
intensity
of
the
hop
flavors
in
favor
of
more
malt
or
spice
complexity
overall
enjoyable
but
seems
more
a
true
ipa
our
double
ipa
than
a
strong
ale
bitter
but
not
a
big
hop
guy
good
for
an
ale
very
tasty
hoppy
as
most
lagunitas
beers
are
but
not
overly
so
nice
malt
blend
i
am
not
a
pale
ale
guy
but
this
one
is
great
because
it
is
well
balanced
with
sweetness
malt
and
spice
the
fact
that
it
is
9
9
abv
and
tastes
this
good
is
impressive
to
put
it
mildly
great
smooth
beer
carmel
brown
sugar
really
well
balanced
a
solid
strong
ale
with
lots
of
flavor
classic
lagunitas
i
would
recommend
sucks
overall
though
smell
was
dead
on
with
some
hops
and
pine
a
sweet
taste
with
juicy
hops
and
some
malt
in
the
finish
overall
another
great
brew
from
lagunitas
glass
snifter
taste
hot
sweet
carmel
mouthful
full
body
perfect
beer
so
good
for
its
class
couldnt
detect
any
hoppy
aromas
in
the
smell
taste
was
overpowering
onion
and
garlic
flavors
i
fear
i
had
a
bad
bottle
because
i
usually
love
lagunitas
other
offerings
i
will
try
it
again
in
the
future
to
confirm
whether
or
not
this
was
indeed
a
bad
bottle
o
my
goto
winter
beer
along
with
left
hand
fade
to
black
vol
1
and
great
divide
hibernation
ale
seriously
near
perfect
imo
lagunitas
does
it
again
one
of
my
top
3
fav
breweries
i
admit
that
im
a
lagunitas
fan
that
being
said
i
still
think
this
is
a
wonderful
full
bodied
ale
there
is
an
amazing
mix
of
hoppiness
and
sweet
malt
that
lets
neither
dominate
but
allows
both
to
stand
forward
the
abv
is
certainly
there
so
be
careful
even
so
you
dont
really
taste
it
another
good
ale
from
lagunitas
not
too
bad
but
ok
cant
drink
it
all
night
nice
amber
color
transparent
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
smells
of
hops
there
is
another
odor
i
cant
quite
pin
possibly
grapefruit
tastes
like
a
slightly
sweet
ipa
i
didnt
get
the
brown
sugar
taste
i
was
expecting
until
my
glass
warmed
a
bit
bone
colored
head
small
streams
of
minor
carbonation
rising
to
the
top
icy
hop
aroma
with
some
sweetness
mixed
in
a
little
metallic
aroma
in
the
smell
metallic
in
the
taste
kind
of
tinny
sweet
some
underlying
hops
but
bitter
nonetheless
getting
sweeter
caramelly
overall
a
decent
brew
i
loved
this
one
slightly
sweet
it
is
about
what
you
would
expect
for
a
10
beer
and
much
less
sweet
than
you
would
expect
due
to
the
name
the
hops
balance
out
this
beer
quite
nicely
as
it
is
very
hoppy
with
a
nice
nose
a
hopped
up
barleywine
is
the
best
way
to
describe
this
bargain
of
a
beer
12
oz
bottle
lagunitas
rarely
ever
lets
me
down
and
this
is
no
exception
i
like
it
give
it
a
try
this
beer
is
awesome
it
has
a
taste
and
an
aroma
all
its
own
it
doesnt
follow
a
style
or
try
to
fit
into
a
niche
its
just
good
if
you
like
barleywines
and
old
ales
youll
love
it
if
you
like
ipas
and
dipas
youll
love
it
wish
it
was
available
year
round
great
beer
drank
this
one
from
the
bottle
and
i
was
not
disappointed
it
really
does
live
up
to
the
hype
very
tropical
a
lot
of
pineapple
going
on
with
some
mellowed
out
tropical
skittles
very
sweet
but
what
would
you
expect
with
a
name
like
brown
shugga
it
has
pretty
good
bitterness
going
on
in
the
back
too
o
4
25
im
kinda
new
to
lagunitas
stuff
and
had
heard
a
lot
about
this
one
i
thought
it
was
good
but
not
top
shelf
run
all
over
town
to
buy
type
of
beer
nice
beer
and
id
add
to
my
rotation
o
nice
beer
with
many
great
flavors
for
this
time
of
year
recommended
cheers
just
an
average
hoppy
beer
overall
ill
give
brown
shugga
lagunitas
brewing
company
a
4
5
i
was
lovin
it
and
will
purchase
this
beer
again
not
too
bad
in
my
opinion
poured
a
nice
clear
reddish
amber
color
with
a
great
fluffy
offwhite
three
finger
head
great
head
retention
and
beautiful
lacing
all
the
way
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
the
smell
is
fruity
and
floral
with
citrus
and
piney
notes
and
just
a
bit
of
malty
sweetness
the
taste
is
fantastic
with
some
sweet
malty
flavors
some
wonderful
fruity
and
grassy
flavors
just
great
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
creamy
with
just
a
light
touch
of
prickly
carbonation
overall
this
is
one
great
beer
what
ive
come
to
expect
from
lagunitas
pretty
good
not
sure
what
to
make
of
it
tastes
like
an
ipa
but
slightly
different
hard
to
put
my
finger
on
it
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
holiday
seasonal
brews
ive
had
sucks
now
for
a
long
time
and
this
is
the
first
time
ive
seen
brown
shugga
and
i
was
blown
away
solid
hoppy
beer
from
start
to
finish
this
was
a
pleasant
surprise
and
only
a
9
99
sixer
and
lives
up
to
the
rep
beautiful
pour
nice
clean
piney
aromas
and
notes
as
well
as
a
healthy
malt
presence
love
the
brown
sugar
addition
pine
keeps
it
clean
evolves
and
changes
in
the
glass
i
will
buy
this
again
pours
with
a
frothy
white
head
that
takes
a
long
time
to
dissipate
tons
of
lace
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
color
is
copper
and
clear
smells
of
passion
fruit
and
honey
as
it
warms
this
becomes
something
of
a
hop
bomb
with
citrus
and
piney
notes
sweet
on
the
tongue
with
a
fairly
abrupt
bitter
finish
a
complex
lovely
beer
i
dont
think
this
is
as
good
as
sucks
but
its
an
interesting
beer
still
tastes
ipaish
to
me
a
good
beer
my
first
one
of
these
found
a
couple
at
the
back
of
the
shelf
at
my
beer
store
pours
a
nice
caramel
clear
color
with
a
big
bad
head
and
really
nice
lacing
aroma
is
of
hops
and
sweetness
kinda
nice
the
hop
bitterness
and
the
brown
sugar
hit
at
the
same
time
providing
a
very
pleasant
blend
of
flavors
they
are
balanced
so
well
that
they
are
fighting
each
other
to
be
on
top
sugar
leaves
a
little
in
the
aftertaste
leaving
a
nice
cool
hop
bitterness
with
a
touch
of
citrus
rind
not
bad
overall
i
am
happy
with
this
brew
as
i
am
with
everything
lagunitas
has
put
out
side
note
those
that
are
familiar
with
stones
lukcy
basartd
will
find
a
strong
correlation
with
regards
to
the
flavor
and
aroma
profile
of
each
thankfully
brown
shugga
is
an
seasonal
release
and
the
other
is
way
more
limited
overall
i
was
impressed
scary
how
easily
drinkable
this
is
for
the
high
abv
great
holiday
beer
no
need
for
any
forensic
details
its
all
kinds
of
good
on
the
tongue
pours
amazing
drinks
amazing
and
feels
amazing
good
beer
bottom
line
lagun
ok
i
had
my
2nd
one
tonight
and
truly
appreciated
this
beer
i
am
not
sure
what
an
american
strong
ale
is
but
to
me
this
was
a
very
good
double
ipa
with
a
great
sweet
undertone
that
really
balanced
the
hop
bitterness
and
flavor
o
a
nice
beer
to
age
probably
a
great
beer
to
have
on
a
cold
autumnwinter
night
after
a
hard
day
of
fun
pour
into
a
snifter
and
drink
in
front
of
the
fire
2014
release
has
outdone
2013
serving
type
bottle
for
some
reason
ive
never
tried
this
one
poured
into
a
snifter
nice
head
great
dark
amber
color
smells
of
sweet
candy
grapefruit
and
some
dank
hops
as
well
flavor
up
front
is
fairly
sweet
with
candy
type
flavors
and
then
the
fruity
hops
hit
on
the
back
end
and
balance
this
brew
out
nicely
great
flavor
for
a
winter
dipa
cant
detect
the
near
10
abv
this
will
definitely
get
a
repeat
visit
to
my
fridge
this
winter
smooth
for
near
10
overall
its
a
great
beer
not
sure
what
style
it
best
fits
probably
more
of
a
dipa
than
anything
else
the
taste
begins
with
the
sweet
malty
goodness
and
the
brown
sugar
but
there
is
a
fascinating
moderate
bitterness
at
the
finish
i
easily
get
2
fingers
of
crackling
light
tan
foam
with
a
easy
pour
retention
is
solid
and
leaves
a
considerable
wall
of
lace
with
consistent
holes
throughout
body
is
a
deep
red
amber
in
tone
nose
is
an
interesting
balance
of
both
sweet
and
hoppy
you
get
both
grassy
hops
and
sassafras
candy
in
the
smell
taste
is
of
resin
based
hops
and
chewy
sassafras
candy
resembling
the
nose
considerably
well
balanced
between
the
malt
and
the
hops
this
is
scary
easy
to
drink
for
nearly
10
alcohol
i
am
really
in
love
with
lagunitas
this
year
they
have
been
so
consistent
i
am
putting
extras
of
these
away
in
the
cellar
to
see
what
magic
works
in
a
brew
that
i
believe
will
age
spectacularly
well
cheers
overall
a
very
solid
brew
and
the
best
seasonal
brew
ive
had
this
year
and
may
just
be
the
best
winter
brew
ive
had
to
date
would
definitely
buy
again
had
this
poured
into
my
trusty
beer
mug
the
colors
excellent
a
molasses
brown
just
as
you
might
expect
the
taste
was
fairly
boozy
not
with
notes
of
brown
sugar
obviously
some
hop
flavor
not
as
much
as
youd
expect
from
lagunitas
good
not
great
an
outstanding
beer
with
a
beautiful
color
and
sweet
taste
how
did
they
hide
the
9
9
abv
so
well
enjoyed
this
very
much
this
beer
is
superb
one
of
my
favorite
strong
ales
to
date
cheers
had
high
expectations
via
word
of
mouth
sadly
disappointed
decent
malt
backbone
with
tons
of
hops
looks
like
a
clear
amber
moderate
lacing
taste
is
overwhelmingly
boozy
followed
by
molasses
and
a
hint
of
sweetness
well
worth
the
price
final
score
4
13
a
solid
strong
ale
that
is
begins
hoppy
and
finishes
malty
and
sweet
it
also
has
just
the
right
amount
of
balls
at
9
99
abv
this
is
totally
not
my
style
a
sweetish
overly
abved
beer
but
wow
is
it
good
never
would
have
tried
it
on
my
own
but
very
glad
that
i
did
very
nice
beer
repeatable
9
99
sells
for
9
99
a
sixer
probably
the
dankest
skunkiest
aroma
ive
encountered
in
a
beer
along
with
sharp
notes
of
grapefruit
flavor
reveals
a
sweet
caramel
malt
backbone
contrasted
by
more
sharp
grapefruit
the
finish
is
resiny
earthy
and
lightly
bitter
this
is
one
mother
of
a
beer
one
of
the
best
strong
ales
ive
had
and
the
sad
thing
is
i
can
only
get
it
this
time
of
year
if
you
take
a
breathe
of
this
in
its
like
sticking
your
nose
in
a
bag
of
brown
sugar
very
sweet
up
front
on
the
nose
goes
down
malty
fig
cinnamon
nutmeg
brown
sugar
a
mildly
spiced
brew
overall
i
am
in
love
with
this
beer
i
wish
they
did
some
variety
for
this
age
it
in
some
whiskey
bourbon
rye
barrels
give
it
an
even
better
kick
the
color
is
great
the
aroma
is
great
the
taste
is
amazing
not
overly
sweet
a
big
hit
wherever
i
bring
it
the
perfect
cool
weather
beer
such
goodness
contained
in
one
12oz
bottle
that
i
cant
take
it
it
looks
like
a
dark
double
ipa
dark
amber
colored
pour
with
a
2
inch
head
that
lingers
for
a
minute
or
two
first
thing
i
smell
when
cracking
the
bottle
is
you
guessed
it
brown
sugar
not
overly
sweet
knock
you
out
brown
sugar
aroma
just
a
nice
deep
smell
that
isnt
over
powering
also
smells
of
tropical
and
piney
hops
not
much
of
a
malt
smell
the
taste
is
just
awesome
exactly
like
the
aroma
this
is
so
easy
to
drink
its
dangerous
id
even
go
to
say
that
its
easier
to
drink
than
a
pale
ale
its
just
so
smooth
being
9
99
abv
in
conclusion
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
tried
thanks
lagunitas
dig
this
one
if
you
combined
a
nice
american
barleywine
with
a
nice
dipa
and
added
a
touch
of
brown
sugar
sweetness
you
might
end
up
with
something
like
this
and
if
you
also
priced
it
very
generously
and
only
released
it
during
the
long
dark
days
of
winterwhen
a
nice
sweet
cheap
and
strong
beer
is
most
welcomeyoud
probably
be
pretty
close
to
answering
the
conundrum
how
come
you
taste
so
good
its
pretty
good
and
very
drinkable
but
i
was
expecting
better
i
remember
this
being
better
then
this
i
dunno
guess
you
have
to
try
it
i
got
a
case
half
gone
so
its
not
that
bad
lol
its
better
then
bad
its
good
so
good
easy
drinking
looks
perfect
the
carbonation
is
on
point
and
the
aftertaste
leaves
you
yearning
for
another
this
beer
is
phenomenal
for
the
priceabv
with
the
taste
it
also
ages
well
almost
too
drinkable
for
the
high
abv
i
must
say
i
was
a
bit
disappointed
with
this
brew
reading
the
reviews
i
imagined
i
was
in
for
a
unique
malt
forward
perfectly
balanced
strong
ale
instead
i
got
something
closer
to
an
american
barleywine
overly
hopped
out
of
balanced
and
one
dimensional
one
reviewer
compared
this
to
hairy
eyeball
i
disagree
as
i
feel
that
hairy
eyeball
is
much
more
balanced
and
tastier
than
brown
shugga
but
as
with
everything
else
if
youve
enjoyed
this
in
the
past
then
thats
all
that
matters
cheers
mild
flavor
with
a
nice
sweetness
pours
a
nice
amber
brown
with
a
khaki
head
that
leaves
trails
down
the
glasses
the
smell
is
full
of
toasted
malt
and
then
citrus
from
the
hops
begins
to
come
through
the
taste
was
great
with
a
nice
balance
first
some
sweetness
and
wonderful
grapefruit
notes
from
the
bitter
hops
very
refreshing
that
typical
lagunitas
sweetness
has
really
mellowed
and
the
balance
is
perfect
still
getting
some
of
the
hops
with
a
perfect
mouthfeel
and
heavenly
smoothness
this
has
given
me
faith
in
ageing
there
beers
as
the
other
shuggas
and
undercovers
i
aged
were
not
that
great
pours
dark
orange
amber
with
a
medium
off
white
slowly
fading
head
with
good
lacing
aroma
of
sweet
caramel
malt
yeast
and
some
citrus
and
pine
as
well
taste
has
some
good
caramel
malt
yeast
mild
orange
and
bitter
hops
palate
is
a
medium
to
full
body
carbonation
is
good
and
a
smooth
mouth
feel
finishes
with
a
good
caramel
malt
and
yeast
flavor
followed
by
citrus
orange
notes
and
bitter
ending
for
balance
considering
this
is
a
barley
wine
it
is
not
as
strong
reminds
me
more
of
an
dipa
but
it
is
still
good
overall
very
good
smooth
balanced
and
flavorful
brew
o
absolutely
terrific
big
flavor
super
smooth
great
mouthfeel
huge
abv
i
hate
myself
for
not
picking
up
more
than
i
did
incredibly
sweet
and
delicious
i
look
forward
to
this
coming
out
every
year
a
strong
toasted
ale
it
has
a
nice
bready
flavor
but
the
alcohol
presence
dampens
the
beer
for
me
solid
overall
i
am
enjoying
this
one
very
favorable
and
tasty
overall
a
quality
beer
although
id
sooner
have
the
straight
up
dipa
substitute
for
this
beer
sucks
rather
than
this
strong
ale
that
straddles
the
line
between
dipa
and
barleywine
that
said
its
one
of
those
beers
where
the
whole
is
certainly
better
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
no
individual
factor
stood
out
to
me
but
when
taken
together
its
quite
a
tasty
brew
a
well
done
brew
that
has
a
lot
going
on
a
nice
sipper
so
alberta
missed
out
on
the
brown
shugga
train
this
last
season
so
i
had
to
wind
up
in
sunny
this
time
victoria
bc
to
snag
a
6pack
how
exactly
do
distributors
make
these
sorts
of
decisions
in
any
event
i
got
to
relive
the
experience
and
now
can
write
a
legit
review
of
this
beer
on
the
basis
of
more
than
fuzzy
memory
traces
particularly
fuzzy
considering
the
abv
on
this
heavy
hitter
color
is
lighter
than
expected
a
clear
reddish
brown
with
generous
amounts
of
sturdy
light
beige
head
smell
is
intensely
sweet
and
malty
yet
with
a
hop
presence
that
makes
one
think
ipa
fruity
with
a
wisp
of
pine
is
this
beer
a
barleywine
a
double
ipa
or
a
key
example
of
the
shades
of
gray
illdefined
americans
strong
category
probably
a
hybrid
that
features
elements
of
all
these
styles
the
palate
is
extremely
fruity
for
starters
fruit
punch
grilled
pineapple
and
candied
boozy
peaches
carrying
the
top
note
and
some
faint
cherry
and
plum
in
the
background
there
is
also
a
tangerine
peel
pepper
and
faint
pine
hop
presence
that
serves
to
cut
the
heavyduty
brown
sugar
sweetness
and
to
my
palate
the
sugar
is
not
as
prominent
as
the
name
and
initial
expectation
might
suggest
this
beer
is
surprisingly
drinkable
on
the
thin
side
of
moderate
and
the
wellconcealed
booze
makes
things
even
more
dangerous
although
i
find
that
the
alcohol
presence
does
grow
over
the
course
of
a
bottle
or
two
moderate
carbonation
and
finishes
sweet
yet
with
some
added
medicinal
bitterness
not
apparent
at
the
front
end
hoppier
lighter
and
perhaps
sweeter
than
its
stablemate
hairy
eyeball
but
certainly
a
close
cousin
with
some
ipa
ancestry
apparent
as
well
id
drink
this
on
a
semiregular
basis
if
it
was
more
available
in
my
neck
of
the
woods
maybe
my
liver
is
glad
it
is
pretty
scarce
httpwww
facebook
comkajiisbeerreviews
this
beer
is
ridiculous
my
liver
hates
it
but
i
love
it
everything
about
this
beer
is
over
the
top
from
the
abv
to
the
taste
but
not
so
much
that
it
is
off
putting
i
have
had
beers
in
the
10
percent
abv
range
that
taste
like
well
booze
but
this
one
you
can
hardly
notice
it
at
all
which
is
not
entirely
a
great
thing
i
drank
4
of
these
before
my
wife
got
home
and
i
was
hammered
she
was
not
happy
but
i
was
this
is
a
very
hoppy
and
all
together
sweet
from
the
malt
sweetness
and
brown
sugar
brew
recommended
for
the
winter
and
holiday
season
or
if
you
forget
you
have
it
and
drink
it
in
april
great
beer
with
a
distinctive
taste
i
would
drink
again
it
is
a
nice
change
on
the
regular
double
ipas
the
aroma
and
taste
smell
of
brown
sugar
and
it
goes
down
sweet
if
you
can
get
this
give
it
a
try
its
not
something
you
will
dislike
overall
this
is
an
excellent
ale
i
enjoy
beer
in
both
quantity
and
quality
and
this
is
one
for
quality
due
to
the
alcoholic
content
one
or
two
is
enough
last
thought
rumor
has
it
that
sucks
came
about
because
lagunitas
messed
up
on
a
batch
of
brown
shugga
is
this
true
overall
not
as
good
as
lil
sumpin
sumpin
hop
stooped
or
sucks
but
a
pretty
satisfying
and
unique
as
well
as
easy
to
drink
and
pallet
able
will
buy
again
i
really
liked
this
one
had
been
wanting
to
try
it
but
hard
to
find
thanks
to
jose
for
sharing
o
lagunitas
makes
a
sweet
beer
taste
great
well
done
and
different
this
beer
has
sweetness
and
bitterness
and
is
in
no
way
balanced
as
if
both
sides
are
bringing
all
they
have
to
the
ring
love
it
remeber
this
one
being
a
lot
better
the
brown
sugar
is
non
existant
this
year
carbonation
a
little
too
high
for
my
liking
it
has
that
soapy
aftertaste
i
hate
in
a
hoppy
beer
my
rating
was
4
25
on
this
one
but
ive
brought
it
down
a
few
notches
meh
this
is
a
great
strong
ale
if
you
get
it
fresh
the
hops
pop
through
nicely
and
it
isnt
as
sweet
as
the
name
suggests
its
a
a
very
drinkable
brew
that
definetly
caught
me
off
guard
the
sweetness
hits
first
but
then
it
seems
to
turn
into
an
american
barley
wine
great
beer
for
the
money
lagunitas
is
the
best
value
out
of
california
out
here
in
pa
a
case
of
stone
ipa
costs
me
43
bucks
while
this
is
about
the
same
price
as
this
brew
that
is
more
complex
and
alcoholic
sucks
is
good
but
its
a
totally
different
beer
and
is
probably
an
easier
drinking
beer
but
if
these
two
were
side
by
side
for
the
same
price
theres
no
question
id
pick
the
brown
shugga
overall
i
really
love
this
beer
and
while
it
is
a
sweet
beer
it
is
not
overly
so
at
all
as
the
flavors
are
all
very
bold
and
very
balanced
love
the
combination
of
citrus
orange
carmel
and
brown
sugar
pine
and
basil
i
will
always
get
at
least
a
case
of
this
every
time
it
comes
around
must
try
o
this
is
a
fine
brew
with
an
amazing
amount
of
flavor
coming
at
you
but
in
a
way
that
you
can
enjoy
lagunitas
has
continued
to
impress
me
with
their
thoughtful
brewing
having
tried
the
replacement
ale
i
had
to
try
this
one
as
well
well
done
o
alcohol
sneaks
up
on
you
for
this
for
one
solid
brew
lagunitas
never
disappoints
very
interesting
beer
it
is
like
an
ipa
but
has
that
biting
bitter
hop
finish
and
cloying
sweetness
of
a
barleywine
almost
a
washed
cheese
rind
flavor
like
trappist
cheese
i
cant
tell
if
i
really
like
it
or
not
which
may
be
why
this
beer
has
captured
my
attention
its
like
stinky
cheese
you
dont
particularly
like
it
but
keep
coming
back
because
of
how
different
it
is
i
will
be
aging
some
bottles
to
see
what
happens
good
stuff
but
then
again
im
not
sure
i
cannot
believe
that
i
have
struck
it
lucky
twice
in
a
row
with
this
brewery
i
have
had
several
from
them
until
recently
that
have
been
less
than
celestial
but
the
last
two
have
been
wonderful
this
one
even
better
than
the
one
aforementioned
in
my
reviews
this
one
had
a
beautiful
burnt
sienna
color
the
head
was
not
overly
lofty
and
it
settled
to
a
nice
yet
carbonated
tipple
the
taste
was
sweet
yet
not
overly
saccharine
it
had
a
nice
malty
component
but
not
overly
so
and
the
hops
what
little
that
i
could
detect
hit
with
just
the
right
amount
of
bite
overall
i
would
say
this
is
one
high
quality
brew
and
one
i
would
definitely
look
for
again
when
it
arrives
next
year
this
ale
pours
a
deep
mahogany
amber
hue
with
a
small
cream
colored
head
that
is
short
lived
and
gives
way
to
a
gentle
off
white
lacing
and
thick
alcohol
legs
the
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
thick
and
sticky
definitely
coats
every
inch
of
your
palate
for
a
long
time
the
nose
is
very
sweet
with
some
nice
hop
notes
and
a
definite
alcohol
vibe
this
is
not
subtle
which
is
one
of
my
favorite
things
about
lagunitas
beers
the
flavor
is
almost
reminiscent
of
a
barley
wine
it
is
deep
and
malty
with
a
hearty
dose
of
west
coast
hops
and
a
very
strong
alcohol
bite
on
the
finish
im
a
huge
fan
if
lagunitas
but
this
beer
is
not
quite
my
taste
it
is
very
good
just
not
my
style
beerandwhiskeyhq
com
o
rated
as
a
strong
ale
but
seems
like
a
hybrid
of
a
malty
dipa
old
ale
and
bw
a
nice
sipper
for
sure
even
though
lagunitas
dumps
enough
sugar
in
this
to
stimulate
a
diabetic
coma
it
really
doesnt
negatively
impact
the
taste
nor
does
the
fairly
high
alc
content
this
is
a
strong
tasting
but
very
balanced
tasty
ale
overall
this
is
one
of
the
top
5
beers
i
have
had
would
absolutely
seek
this
beer
out
we
get
very
limited
amount
where
im
at
but
was
lucky
enough
to
secure
one
case
from
my
local
a
reddish
brown
golden
amber
color
very
nice
cream
head
that
has
good
retention
and
lacing
aroma
of
sweet
apple
cider
or
could
be
apple
pie
with
a
hint
of
cinnamon
malty
with
just
a
bit
of
hops
bitterness
no
standout
indications
that
it
is
a
high
abv
brew
just
a
little
alcohol
burn
in
the
throat
but
not
until
after
a
few
sips
very
smooth
medium
bodied
with
some
nice
sugar
stickiness
this
ale
could
be
dangerous
but
in
a
very
good
way
so
good
i
had
to
force
myself
to
sip
and
enjoy
rather
than
gulp
it
down
bold
beer
in
all
aspects
malty
hoppy
and
yeasty
i
usually
dont
like
sugar
bombs
but
this
one
is
rather
an
interesting
brew
it
transitions
between
a
dipa
and
a
barley
wine
o
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
way
the
hops
showed
up
at
the
end
giving
a
bitter
aftertaste
very
pleasant
beer
that
is
very
nice
to
drink
not
much
weaknesses
but
could
be
better
came
back
to
this
in
jan
31
2015
and
loved
it
again
sipper
must
try
yep
pours
an
opaque
dark
rubycopper
with
a
half
finger
of
frothy
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
a
lot
of
sticky
lacing
nose
is
very
hop
forward
with
a
mix
of
floral
and
pine
hops
there
are
a
lot
of
sweet
dark
fruits
mainly
plum
and
cherry
a
smooth
balance
of
caramel
and
roasted
malts
mouth
is
very
bitter
and
hoppy
up
front
a
surprising
amount
of
citrus
is
present
with
a
strong
grapefruit
presence
that
blends
perfectly
with
the
dark
fruits
very
roasty
with
some
booze
but
its
very
well
hidden
overall
this
beer
will
defiantly
be
a
regular
for
me
every
year
whenever
i
can
find
it
poured
from
a
12

smells
of

and
citrus
hops
with
slight
grain
tastes
of
citrus
and
earthy
hops
with
nice

sweet
but
not
too
sweet
beer
is
full
bodied
with
great
bite
and
good
level
of
carbonation
not
overly
boozy
overall
a
very
good

oddly
i
sniff
and
sniff
but
i
dont
get
a
ton
of

i
know
theres
some
brown
sugar
and
maybe
thats
what
has
eliminated
most
of
the
smell
taste
is
initially
sweetbut
generous
hopping
gives
it
a
nice
bitterness
and
then
a
sweetness
returns
in
the
fade
mouthfeel
seems
a
bit
carbonated
and
that
bitterness
pricks
the
tongue

categoriesbrown
shugga
is
still
a
quality
beer
i
would
say
lagunitas
should
dial
down
the
alcohol
just
a
tad
and
try
for
a
better
carbonation
level
that
would
help
cut
the
booziness
and
give
the
mouthfeel
a
boost
overall
definitely
worth
checking
out
its
tasty
pours
a
clear
goldish
amber
with
dense
white
head
and
tons
of
lacing
the
nose
starts
with
some
aromatic
hops
which
is
quickly
joined
by
candy
like
malt
notes
notes
of
caramel
brown
sugar
imagine
that
and
floral
hops
are
all
present
the
taste
starts
with
heavy
sugar
sweetness
which
is
followed
by
a
swift
hop
bitterness
the
hops
dont
seem
to
cut
the
sweetness
too
much
rather
it
adds
an
earthy
and
floral
component
to
the
sweet
malts
and
makes
for
some
similarities
to
wildflower
honey
mouthfeel
is
highly
carbonated
and
has
a
somewhat
sticky
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
bit
sweet
for
me
and
the
hop
character
just
isnt
my
favorite
pairing
remarks
good
beer
overall
but
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
us
hops
overall
overall
this
reminds
me
a
lot
of
sierra
nevada
bigfoot
with
less
of
a
hop
presence
the
hops
are
still
there
and
very
high
in
quality
flavorwise
the
balance
the
hops
and
malts
strike
in
this
beer
make
it
one
to
savor
and
then
maybe
have
another
o
another
excellent
brew
from
lagunitas
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
for
9

abv
exactly
what
an
american
strong
ale
should
be
pretty
good
late
night
winter
warmer
this
thick
sweet
semi
syrupy
brew
is
very
original
in
its
flavor
profile
the
booze
keeps
things
warm
and
sippable
throughout
the
sweet
hoppy
experience
i
thought
this
one
was
way
better
as
it
warmed
things
were
very
smooth
at
slightly
cooler
than
room
temp
this
is
more
like
sipping
brandy
or
cognac
rather
than
drinking
a
beer
i
am
definitely
warmed
all
over
after
one
it
packs
a
punch
o
i
enjoyed
this
beer
it
got
better
as
it
warmed
and
the
flavors
played
really
well
together
strong
flavors
if
i
could
change
anything
i
would
tone
the
booze
back
a
touch
ogreat
strong
ale
perfect
for
the
winter
months
to
warm
you
up
with
the
10
abv
o
despite
a
lower
scoring
very
enjoyable
and
very
easy
to
drink
in
fact
too
easy
to
drink
considering
the
high
abv
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
its
a
sweet
and
bitter
holidayflavored
treat
that
sits
well
on
my
palate
certainly
not
as
malty
as
an
english
barleywine
i
understand
why
lagunitas
made
fun
of
themselves
for
not
releasing
this
and
instead
substituted
lagunitas
sucks
its
a
good
beer
at
a
really
good
price
point
for
10
abv
o
a
great
big
flavor
ipastyle
beer
not
sure
the
brown
sugarcane
sugar
made
a
huge
difference
flavorwise
when
compared
to
the
regular
lagunitas
ipa
but
it
is
a
good
beer
all
the
same
would
be
interested
to
try
the
two
headtohead
for
a
comparison
serving
type

another
excellent

from

extremely
drinkable

such
high
abv
at

my
new
template
for
what
an
american
strong
ale
should
be
well
balanced
strong
smooth
and
drinkable
in
the
glass
this
was
a
very
nice
looking
brew
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
nice
full
head
the
color
of
dirty
straw
the
lacing
on
the
glass
was
very
solid
a
very
strong
smell
of
carmel
and
malt
hints
of
pine
and
herbs
the
mouth
feel
was
very
creamy
and
sweet
with
a
nice
bitter
on
the
back
the
flavors
are
of
carmel
pine
and
dark
fruits
the
brown
sugar
is
by
far
the
most
noticeable
of
the
flavors
but
very
well
balanced
even
with
an
abv
of
9
this
is
a
very
easy
drinkable
brew
went
well
with
my
lamb
stew
i
cant
believe
i
missed
out
on
this
last
year
but
my
year
of
waiting
has
paid
off
well
this
is
fantastic
stuff
it
is
destined
to
fail
in
so
many
respects
but
the
malt
profile
as
well
as
the
herbal
backbone
meld
so
well
with
the
addition
of
brown
sugar
that
it
really
reveals
that
the
gents
over
at
lagunitas
seem
to
pretty
much
know
what
theyre
doing
when
they
approach
any
beer
recipe
i
feel
this
would
get
too
sweet
if
aged
as
the
hops
provide
a
much
needed
bitterness
to
round
things
out
recommended
for
sure
i
tried
to
session
this
last
year
bad
idea
however
something
to
be
slowsipped
and
enjoyed
during
the
frigid
san
diego
winter
weather
i
have
to
say
i
was
a
bit
disappointed
overall
a
good
beer
but
not
great
i
have
may
even
overrated
it
a
bit
o
a
good
brew
nothing
im
in
love
with
would
drink
again
but
probably
not
a
future
purchase
pop
the
tops
and
smell
the
hops
lagunitas
is
the
best
at
it
here
comes
the
hop
but
this
time
she
brings
a
stranger
nice
to
meet
you
brown
sugar
i
think
well
be
fast
friends
o
this
is
a
great
beer
at
a
great
price
10
for
a
6pack
of
10
beer
that
taste
good
is
outstanding
this
is
a
must
buy
fantastic
beer
for
being
a
9
9
abv
a
very
enjoyable
strongfestivewinter
ale
nothing
too
fancy
just
a
very
tasty
hop
profile
matched
well
with
a
solid
malt
backbone
notes
a
bit
of
a
tweener
big
malt
backbone
and
overall
its
fairly
sweet
but
there
is
enough
hops
and
alcohol
to
give
it
a
zing
pretty
balanced
between
flavors
but
bold
flavors
at
the
same
time
solid
beer
especially
at
the
price
but
nothing
outstanding
if
you
want
a
solid
high
abv
at
a
pretty
low
price
then
go
for
it
okinda
like
double
bag
on
steroids
not
my
favorite
lagunitas
but
for
a
6
pack
its
not
a
bad
deal
this
is
a
great
seasonal
christmas
beer
one
that
is
best
for
beer
lovers
especially
ipa
lovers
looking
for
a
sweet
fix
overall
a
good
malty
and
sweet
brew
with
a
decent
level
of
hop
and
a
great
drinkability
even
at
9
9
abv
a
rather
nice
and
easy
drinking
big
brew
overall
this
beer
doesnt
do
it
for
me
ive
still
got
that
shitty
bitter
hop
taste
in
my
mouth
gotta
go
and
brush
up
i
suppose
i
was
mislead
by
the
label
i
expected
something
more
of
sweet
malts
and
less
hops
but
of
course
i
should
have
known
better
west
coast
beers
hops
i
guess
i
slipped
up
nice
beer
will
grab
one
again
soon
medium
to
full
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
slight
boozy
burn
after
taste
lingers
for
quite
awhile
making
it
a
great
sipper
one
of
the
best
parts
of
buying
a
lagunitas
beer
is
not
having
to
break
the
bank
10
bucks
for
a
sixer
of
nearly
10
abv
beer
equals
one
heck
of
a
deal
ill
grab
at
least
one
sixer
every
year
2
oz
bottle
in
a
snifter
pours
a
clear
amber
with
a
moderate
offwhite
head
aroma
is
mango
grapefruit
orange
pine
and
a
bit
of
sugary
sweetness
i
dont
think
any
brewery
creates
such
beautiful
smelling
beers
as
lagunitas
taste
mostly
follows
the
nose
with
a
slight
malty
taste
at
the
back
of
the
throat
that
aftertaste
is
about
the
only
thing
reminding
me
that
this
is
a
barley
wine
as
usual
lagunitas
has
created
a
superb
brew
strong
check
warming
check
sweet
check
this
beer
had
all
of
those
attributes
while
never
feeling
sticky
sugary
or
chewy
there
was
a
lot
to
like
here
even
if
it
felt
like
an
ale
that
wanted
to
be
a
dessert
beer
there
wasnt
anything
else
i
could
have
picked
up
from
the
store
that
was
quite
like
this
and
because
the
hop
profile
was
so
pronounced
here
it
kept
this
from
feeling
like
an
imperial
brown
ale
or
a
barleywine
that
was
brewed
in
america
take
this
for
what
its
worth
a
strong
ale
with
lots
of
taste
and
body
even
if
it
doesnt
quite
know
what
it
wants
to
be
this
ones
worth
savoring
to
over
a
good
rolling
stones
anthology
as
im
certain
that
this
will
endure
just
as
well
as
the
song
its
named
after
highly
recommended
as
an
alternative
to
the
seasonal
offerings
currently
on
the
shelf
full
round
mouth
with
a
sweet
start
and
a
bitter
dry
finish
brown
sugar
and
mango
followed
by
bitter
citrus
and
herbal
notes
beautifully
balanced
crisp
sweet
bitter
and
damn
delicious
you
can
hardly
notice
the
alcohol
in
this
one
overall
great
job
by
lagunitas
again
not
my
favorite
offering
from
them
but
thats
more
a
fault
of
my
taste
rather
than
the
beer
itself
great
if
you
like
sweeter
beers
or
need
something
lighter
than
a
stout
to
warm
up
on
a
cold
night
definitely
a
complex
flavor
profile
everything
else
they
brew
i
seem
to
love
but
this
this
is
just
not
for
me
i
am
trying
to
not
be
too
hard
on
it
well
first
off
i
used
to
have
a
cat
years
ago
that
would
piss
on
the
front
door
if
i
was
sleeping
and
couldnt
let
him
out
and
this
beer
smells
like
what
that
cat
was
pissing
so
right
off
i
am
not
too
happy
but
it
could
get
better
mouthfeel
is
ok
but
damned
if
it
doesnt
taste
like
it
smells
cat
piss
i
mustve
had
a
funky
assed
cat
cause
at
16
when
his
bladder
was
iffy
and
he
couldnt
wait
he
was
pissing
brown
shugga
i
just
cant
get
over
it
not
even
sure
i
can
give
this
a
fair
review
because
of
it
o
as
this
warms
up
it
gets
sweeter
but
there
isnt
much
there
besides
the
sweetness
and
the
alcohol
taste
you
can
definitely
smell
the
hops
but
theyre
hardly
present
in
the
flavor
ive
had
much
better
from
lagunitas
at
10
99
for
a
6
pack
this
is
probably
the
last
time
ill
buy
a
pack
enjoyed
this
one
a
great
deal
would
definitely
pick
up
a
few
more
in
the
future
o
interesting
brew
i
take
one
sip
and
im
thinking
dipa
the
next
sip
and
im
thinking
stronle
ale
nice
balance
and
complexity
overall
beautifully
well
crafted
brew
that
is
pretty
much
a
hybrid
dipa
it
absolutely
dellivers
and
i
will
be
crazy
not
to
buy
this
again
this
is
another
reason
why
i
have
fallen
in
love
with
lagunitas
just
keep
them
coming
salud
yeah
really
awesome
stuff
pours
a
hazy
amber
color
with
a
halffinger
of
white
head
that
retains
well
the
nose
has
earthy
hops
sweet
dark
malt
honey
and
alcohol
the
taste
is
sweet
with
a
strong
boozy
quality
but
it
finishes
bitter
and
dry
like
an
ipa
mouthfeel
is
a
little
bit
creamy
with
medium
carbonation
its
a
unique
beer
the
definition
of
a
sipper
because
the
alcohol
is
overwhelming
and
it
seems
even
higher
than
its
9
9
abv
o
wow
really
really
good
pours
a
clear
medium
amber
with
a
full
frothy
head
that
laces
very
well
full
nose
of
pine
and
citrus
hops
against
a
sweet
dark
malt
background
medium
carbonation
and
a
medium
heavy
mouthfeel
an
excellent
taste
is
achieved
with
a
balance
towards
the
hops
against
a
strong
malt
bill
sweetness
hop
flavor
is
balanced
but
tilted
slightly
to
the
piney
side
but
finishes
with
a
grapefruit
citrus
note
bitterness
is
noticeable
on
the
clean
finish
and
lingers
with
that
9
9
alcohol
pleasant
burn
an
outstanding
beer
that
shows
what
flavor
is
all
about
all
are
there
but
none
predominates
making
this
a
complex
work
of
brewer
art
when
i
first
tried
brown
shugga
last
year
it
was
a
borderline
drain
pour
for
me
despite
the
fact
that
ive
enjoyed
similar
beers
double
bastard
comes
to
mind
something
about
the
particular
hopgrain
bill
didnt
work
for
me
with
some
age
palate
adjustment
probably
both
its
clear
that
this
is
a
great
beer
only
hopheads
need
apply
though
have
had
a
few
of
beers
from
these
guys
and
liked
all
of
them
but
never
blown
away
by
any
of
them
this
one
almost
gets
there
for
me
but
not
quite
it
was
a
great
small
change
of
pace
from
the
dipa
kick
ive
been
on
lately
and
still
gets
me
my
hop
fix
certainly
the
best
lagunitas
ive
had
looking
fwd
to
the
other
5
i
have
and
will
seek
out
more
soon
o
this
is
a
lagunitas
brew
for
s
sure
big
backbone
and
hoppy
this
one
gets
a
little
too
sweet
and
not
quite
enough
hop
punch
for
me
though
unique
beer
wasnt
expecting
the
amount
of
hops
that
came
with
it
poured
dark
copper
with
a
couple
inches
of
head
that
stayed
with
me
pretty
much
the
entire
time
cant
quite
pinpoint
the
smell
not
please
to
but
not
repugnant
either
dont
taste
brown
sugar
though
maybe
cause
of
the
amount
if
hops
in
it
though
it
does
have
a
sweetness
mixed
with
the
hops
that
makes
it
quite
enjoyable
alcohol
will
sneak
up
on
you
as
it
is
barely
noticeable
gonna
age
a
few
of
these
and
see
how
they
develop
o
good
beer
happy
that
i
tried
it
packs
a
punch
with
the
strong
hop
and
malt
presence
love
this
beer
its
put
together
well
and
packs
a
punch
one
of
the
best
bangs
for
the
buck
available
overall
truly
outstanding
and
always
a
fantastic
great
beer
great
for
the
fall
like
sucks
for
sweater
season
great
o
great
beer
very
very
drinkable
for
such
a
strong
beer
im
impressed
will
buy
and
drink
more
of
this
overall
this
is
a
dangerously
delicious
brew
and
one
of
my
favorite
seasonals
luxurious
but
approachable
and
dangerously
drinkable
virtually
no
perceptible
signs
of
the
high
abv
and
a
damn
good
value
to
boot
lagunitas
brown
shugga
45
overall
this
was
an
awesome
beer
great
balance
and
lots
of
complexity
overall
just
what
id
hoped
for
bold
hoppy
flavors
softened
by
a
light
sweet
touch
a
rich
beer
but
not
cloying
im
trying
this
on
a
cold
november
night
and
this
is
just
what
i
wanted
in
my
beer
today
overall
this
is
definitely
an
interesting
beer
although
im
really
not
sure
what
to
make
of
it
i
feel
like
they
could
have
definitely
gotten
away
with
calling
this
a
dipa
although
i
guess
they
did
a
little
better
not
attributing
it
to
a
style
at
all
i
tend
to
like
hoppy
beers
better
when
theyre
a
little
bit
lowerabv
and
the
brown
sugar
mixed
with
the
booziness
can
make
it
seem
a
little
sickly
sweet
occasionally
so
i
do
have
some
problems
with
it
but
the
hop
flavors
are
really
nice
and
the
brown
sugar
is
a
nice
addition
and
its
definitely
unusual
and
interesting
so
i
did
really
enjoy
it
d
brown
shugga
is
one
beer
that
dont
fuck
around
it
packs
a
wallop
in
both
flavor
and
alcohol
it
is
a
little
unbalanced
but
in
a
good
way
like
one
would
expect
from
a
strong
ale
the
malts
dominate
over
a
modest
hop
kick
and
the
brown
sugar
comes
through
nicely
in
both
flavor
and
aroma
both
tasty
and
robust
i
would
say
one
could
cellar
this
but
why
wait
a
great
seasonal
classic
o
not
bad
stuff
some
more
aggressive
flavors
at
work
in
this
beer
than
are
found
in
any
other
lagunitas
offering
at
9
9
abv
this
beer
means
business
and
it
tastes
like
it
means
business
too
its
the
brawler
of
the
lagunitas
portfolio
still
fun
and
fairly
easy
to
drink
despite
its
size
overall
a
very
tasty
brew
just
wish
i
could
land
a
few
more
bottles
o
another
great
beer
from
lagunitas
at
almost
10
abv
and
priced
around
9
per
6pack
this
has
to
be
one
of
the
better
beer
values
out
there
overall
im
highly
pleased
with
this
and
looking
forward
to
breaking
out
the
next
bottle
another
solid
brew
from
lagunitas
final
thoughts
brown
shugga
is
exactly
what
the
style
implies
the
hop
character
of
an
imperial
ipa
with
the
malt
presence
of
a
barleywine
at
9
99
a
sixer
its
pretty
hard
to
pass
up
would
i
drink
it
again
yes
overall
sweet
and
sticky
but
not
cloying
but
still
has
a
very
large
hop
presence
very
well
done
and
drinkable
o
really
well
rounded
beer
i
like
it
much
better
than
the
fresh
version
it
seems
to
be
a
much
smoother
and
easier
drinking
version
tasty
sweet
strong
and
powerful
odd
after
taste
a
little
like
a
good
dip
definitely
taste
and
smell
the
brown
sugar
very
mellow
in
your
mouth
sweet
release
is
a
good
name
as
you
have
a
hint
of
brown
sugar
in
the
after
taste
dont
have
any
get
some
o
this
is
my
first
time
having
it
its
different
than
my
typical
ipas
and
stouts
at
9
9
abv
its
really
drinkable
i
think
this
is
a
great
fallwinter
offering
you
cant
beat
the
price
of
this
6pack
for
the
amount
of
alcohol
in
the
beer
even
though
i
did
enjoy
this
beer
im
not
sure
if
id
pick
up
another
6
pack
but
its
well
crafted
and
something
id
expect
from
lagunitas
a
great
beer
lagunitas
is
one
of
those
breweries
that
i
can
buy
anything
from
and
know
i
am
going
to
at
the
very
least
like
it
not
many
breweries
out
there
i
can
say
that
about
i
like
this
one
fresh
it
is
also
great
aged
at
its
price
you
are
almost
required
to
pick
up
a
6
if
not
more
tried
this
one
and
while
i
like
it
i
am
not
sure
i
can
recommend
at
9
9
it
is
definitely
a
strong
ale
and
i
could
not
imagine
drinking
more
than
one
of
these
at
a
sitting
the
brown
sugar
is
quite
pronounced
from
smell
through
taste
along
with
the
the
hops
and
the
strong
malt
backbone
it
is
an
interesting
contrast
ok
i
will
recommend
o
im
glad
i
tried
this
one
as
it
was
a
really
good
beer
it
was
much
better
than
i
expected
will
probably
have
a
couple
more
and
cellar
a
couple
the
beer
dances
that
beautiful
line
between
sweetness
and
bitterness
it
really
attacks
hard
on
both
sides
a
really
exceptional
example
of
an
american
barleywine
o
wow
glad
i
snagged
this
one
off
the
shelf
i
will
definitely
be
going
back
for
more
perhaps
to
lay
a
few
down
this
is
a
damn
good
brew
served
it
in
a
red
wine
glass
handsome
appearance
a
slow
motion
beer
not
one
for
the
quaffer
one
to
linger
over
while
things
get
into
the
off
ramp
of
life
update
121913
cant
believe
i
waited
this
long
to
have
another
from
the
sixpack
but
unfortunately
this
one
is
similar
to
the
first
except
the
vinegardirty
feet
smell
and
taste
are
subdued
enough
that
it
is
not
as
close
to
being
a
drain
pour
still
far
from
the
promised
sweet
release
funny
how
one
bottle
can
be
ok
and
yet
another
from
the
very
same
sixpack
can
be
so
much
worse
overall
huge
battle
of
bitter
and
sweet
bitter
wins
out
for
now
its
good
but
i
want
to
revisit
this
one
when
it
is
not
so
fresh
this
beer
reminds
me
a
lot
lot
of
dfh
burton
baton
minus
the
oak
thats
a
very
high
compliment
o
a
classic
more
hoppy
then
brown
this
strong
ale
delivers
a
wallop
and
will
keep
you
warm
on
a
cold
eve
poured
into
a
sierra
nevada
ipa
glass
because
thats
all
i
had
available
at
the
time
good
creamy
head
with
decent
lacing
smells
like
brown
sugar
and
molassesy
with
a
hint
of
hops
taste
is
sweet
a
little
hoppy
bitterness
can
pick
up
the
alcohol
but
is
not
overpowering
especially
for
a
high
abv
mouthfeel
is
about
right
for
a
strong
ale
descent
carbonation
not
too
bad
o
big
and
hoppy
if
youre
into
that
which
i
am
this
is
a
great
beer
pours
honey
gold
with
a
decent
sized
head
im
drinking
this
out
of
a
bulleit
bourbon
glass
so
were
talking
about
two
inches
of
ale
and
an
inch
and
a
half
of
head
looks
pretty
stellar
the
nose
is
tangy
barely
funky
with
pine
and
candied
fruit
while
the
flavor
is
sweet
up
front
with
apricot
and
peach
on
the
tongue
and
then
bitter
in
the
throat
theres
also
a
spice
element
to
it
and
i
also
get
like
pez
or
smarties
candy
in
the
nose
midsip
for
9
99
abv
you
sure
wouldnt
know
it
ive
had
7s
and
8s
that
tasted
boozier
than
this
does
bottle
says
that
its
brewed
with
brown
cane
sugar
which
you
know
from
the
name
and
all
i
was
picturing
a
molassesderived
brown
sugar
but
the
raw
sugar
makes
more
sense
i
remember
having
this
at
a
beer
festival
a
few
years
ago
and
being
duly
corrected
after
asking
for
the
brown
its
not
a
brown

544another
mighty
fine
beer
from
lagunitas
that
falls
squarely
into
strong
ale
territory
there
are
hops
aplenty
but
with
a
very
intetesting
and
complex
sugary
malt
bill
backing
them
this
stuff
is
really
nice
now

i
suspect
that
id
be
rewarded
if
i
can
show
the
patience
and
restraint
to
save
a

5for
a
beer
with
such
a

abv
the
drinkability
of
the
beer
is
outrageous
i
can
easily
see
myself
getting
into
a
little
bit
of
trouble
with
this
brew
i
am
not
a
fan
of
really
high
abv
beers
but
those
quickly
give
way
to
the
sweet
malty
tones
brought
on
by
the
brown
shugga
thats
been
added
to
the
brew

nice

not
as
sweet
as
i
expected
it
to
be
from
the

there
was
a
little
bit
of
a
roasted
smell
in
there
and
some
hops
as
well
the
taste
wasnt
overly
sweet
i
may
have
to
verify
it
this
summer
if
you
like
stronger
beers
with
some
sweetness
to
it
caramel
pine
and
citrus
but
the
biggest
players
were
by
far
caramel
and
a
burnt
sugary
almost
molasses
like
aroma
l
this
one
lace
is
much
and
lots
of
cling
brown
sugar
im
not
sure
id
seek
it
out
nodakapr

but
as
it
flows
across
your
tongue
the
hops
let
you
know
they
are
there
and
finally
with
a

you
get
the
alcohol

this

drinkability
comes
across

sounds

too
sticky

boozy
md
it
has

a

making

it

i
just

drinkable
d
this
was

brew
could
have
used
a

balance
with
additional
bitterness
really
really
enjoying
this
beer
i
would
highly
recommend
it
too
sweet
to
drink
more
than
a

but
something
good
to
try
one
is
enough
for
me
for
a
while
a
bit
too
much
sweetness
for
it
to
be
a
favorite
of
mine
it
pours
a
very
deep
amber
with
about
a
finger
of
head
i
got
no
lace
the
smell
is
pretty
light
for
a
strong

toasted
brown
sugar
toffee
and
citrus
drift
into
my
nose
holes
the
taste
starts
shockingly
sweet
very
malty
very
sweet
it
is
almost
balanced
by
citrus
and
pine
hop
flavor
but
not
quite
a
bit
better
than
last
years
cola
taste
it
is
still
far
too
sticky
and
leaves
a
mouth
coat
for
days
i
get
that
its
thick
strong
and
sugary
but
it
becomes
a
bit
much
by
the
end
on
the
drinkability
scale
eh
always
an
interesting
beer
to
sample
each
year

brown
shuggas
back
so
i
went
back
and
looked
at
my
old
beer
novice
review
who
the
hell
would
mix
a
barleywine
and
an
ipa
i
guess
i
really
hadnt
had
many
barleywines
at
all
then
i
still
think
the
sugared
grapefruit
line
is
perfect
for
the
finish
though
d
this
is
one
fine
beer
i
mean
i
wouldnt
expect
to
down
a
full
6er
while
watching
a
football
game
but
it
certain
makes
for
a
nice
after
dinner
beverage
or
a
before
dinner
beverage
or
an
after
breakfast
beverage
you
get
the
point
it
aint
bad
folks
bye
drinkability
highly
drinkable
despite
high
abv
i
have
never
had
more
than
6
in
a
row
seemed
like
2
too
many
while
this
isnt
my
favorite
beer
out
there
it
was
definitely
a
change
of
pace
and
a
good
drink
id
probably
have
it
again
deep
caramel
in
color
with
hints
of
amber
and
perfect
clarity
poured
with
a
rich
foamy
offwhite
head
that
leaves
a
well
defined
ladder
of
sticky
lacings
citrus
orange
and
grapefruit
aromas
with
an
underlying
sweet
sugary
aroma
smooth
creamy
feel
with
soft
pleasant
carbonation
medium
to
full
bodied
grapefruit
and
orange
citrus
flavors
ride
a
wave
of
sweetness
through
the
middle
finishes
lazily
with
sweet
caramel
flavors
that
taper
to
pine
hop
flavors
and
the
faintest
hint
of
alcoholic
heat
the
way
the
flavors
come
to
a
slow
finish
really
slows
the
pace
of
this
to
a
sipper
a
nice
combination
of
sweet
caramel
flavors
and
citrus
hops
i
first
tried
this
beer
years
ago
though
i
dont
remember
it
being
this
hoppy
this
flavorful
or
dammit
this
good
honey

loved
the
brown

smell
with
some
spicy
hops
and
the
equivalent
tastecaramel
coats
your
mouth
brown
sugar
leaps
out
at
you
theres
just
enough
citrus

to
keep
things
bitterly
interesting
alcohol
is
very
well
masked
although
it
does
creep
in
at
the
end
of
the
swallow
i
thought
the
mouthfeel
was
not
really
fullbodied
enough
to
hold
up
the
taste
which
is
why
ive
marked
it
down
but
it
was
still
a
delicious
beer
sweet
and
boozy
like
the
most
deliciously
alcoholic
coffee
cake
youve
ever
had
d
moderate
d
about
right
for
a
dark
beer
with
9
abv
da
little
lower
because
of
the
high
abv
but
still
delicious
pick
up
a
6
pack
if
you
can
overall
a
very
nice
beer
with
good
balance
between
malt
and
hops
d
a
solidly
made
drinkable
beer
d
i
would
surely
buy
this
again
and
again
and
again
d
you
would
never
guess
this
was
a
high
octane
beer
very
sweet
tastiness
with
a
strong
hop
balance
im
convinced
that
lagunitas
only

runs
12oz

into

noel

yields
a

on

brownish
red
beer
the
aroma
is
malty
and
sweetsmelling
with
some
very
light
dark
fruit
notes
the
taste
starts
with
brown
sugar
or
is
that
just
the
name
leading
into
a
sweet
maltiness
that
coats
the
palette
a
little
bit
of
a
spicy
alcohol
burn
into
the
finish
overall
a
very
nice
beer
and
different
from
any
of
lagunitass
other
offerings
im
definitely
going
to
buy
at
least
another
6
pack
of
this
stuff
its
way
too
good
not
to
buy
more
of
drink
a
nice
sipper
beer
that
is
good
for
the
holidayscolder
weather
im
happy
i
tried
it
we
walk
the
woods
searching
for
chanterelles
uncertain
whether
we
should
open
this
beer
finally
we
find
one
to
celebrate
we
pop
the
top
and
walk
around
aimlessly
for
another
half
hour
with
only
a
few
hedgehogs
to
show
for
it
it
is
hoppier
than
usual
perhaps
just
much
more
fresh
but
the
citrus
hops
are
big
and
bold
as
company
to
the
shugga
and
carmelized
malt
sweetness
finishes
very
nicely
without
the
lingering
sweetness
of
years
past
the
smell
is
strong
alcohol
and
citrus
with
the
malt
it
is
distinctively
lagunitas
definitely
excellent
sexy
red
in
the
glass
too
d
this
is
a
great
winter
sipper
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
for
sure
d
very
good
beer
but
not
my
favorite
strong
ale
reminded
me
too
much
of
an
ipa
but
i
still
enjoyed
it
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
it
is
well
balanced
and
more
enjoyable
than
i
would
have
believed
considering
what
some
others
have
said
about
this
brew
being
sickening
sweet
for
almost
10
abv
the
alcohol
is
hidden
fairly
well
but
not
completely
masked
drinkability
really
interesting
beer
that
has
a
dynamic
ive
never
tasted
before
the
beer
is
complex
yet
simple
one
for
the
sweetness
on
my
charts
thanks
to
spinrsx
for
the
afternoon
sampling
d
this
high
octane
ale
is
incredibly
drinkable
with
the
abv
very
nicely
hidden
nice
bold
flavours
with
the
hops
and
malts
nicely
balanced
i
have
yet
to
be
disappointed
by
these
guys
and
this
is
yet
another
winner
scrumptious
indeed
d
for
me
the
warmer
it
got
the
better
it
seemed
it
seemed
to
expand
in
the
mouth
and
the
heat
of
the
abv
came
through
i
could
drink
this
all
night
tastes
exactly
like
what
i
had
hoped
a
full
boogey
ale
full
of
rich
roasted
malt
and
a
nice
hop
balance
the
heat
from
the
10
abv
is
so
nice
this
is
practically
the
perfect
beer
for
me
hope
these
are
available
in
heaven
drinkability
a
sipper
i
struggled
too
sweet
and
nourishing
feels
like
a
whole
meal
dessert
in
fact
as
it
warmed
up
it
became
unbearably
hot
and
sweet
not
like
a
huge
barleywine
but
just
unpleasant
like
hotandcooked
orange
juice
i
left
one
quarter
of
my
pint
not
a
big
fan
of
this
one
d
the
higher
abv
is
not
very
upfront
at
all
which
really
adds
to
the
drinkability
but
the
bitterness
seems
to
linger
for
a
bit
hurting
drinkability
overall
it
is
pretty
smooth
and
definitely
tasty
the
sweetness
does
eventually
catch
up
with
this
beer
note
this
review
is
from
notes
from
112910
d
a
decent
brew
i
might
consider
another
if
its
the
first
beer
of
the
night
the
abv
is
up
there
this
is
a
great
unique
hoppy
beer
that
really
doesnt
know
what
style
it
wants
to
be
but
its
awesome
lagunitas
says
its
a
barleywine
gone
wrong
works
for
me
perfect
for
the
fall
season
thick
mouthfeel
almost
chewy
no
alcohol
noticeable
and
for
9
99
that
is
crazy
best
to
stick
to
one
also
i
will
be
cellaraging
a
few
to
look
for
developments
over
the
next
year
and
a
half
drink
would
be
a
good
session
beer
on
a
cold
day
while
camping
around
the
fire
12oz
bottle
pours
a
copper
color
with
a
thin
head
that
dissipates
quickly
small
amount
of
lacing
aromas
of
hops
brown
sugar
and
an
overall
sweet
smell
taste
is
hops
mixed
with
brown
sugar
sweet
boozey
and
somewhat
bready
this
beer
has
that
nice
hoppiness
to
it
you
expect
from
lagunitas
but
the
brown
sugar
sweetness
is
almost
too
much
overall
i
like
it
and
this
is
a
high
octane
brew
that
drinks
well
but
it
is
very
sweet
d
i
have
nothing
but
positive
things
to
say
about
this
beer
it
might
be
among
my
favorites
of
all
time
excellent
balance
of
sweet
and
bitter
easy
does

golden

i
want
paint
my
living

this
color
it
smells
of
the
the
brown
sugar
there
is
a
very
one
dimensional
smell
here
all
sugar
on
the
nose
overpowering
everything
else
this
is
a
very
good
tasting
beer
the
dominating
taste
is
sweetness
but
not
without
complexity
for
such
a
sweet
beer
there
is
a
decent
amount
going
on
beyond
just
sweetness
this
is
a
very
drinkable
and
pleasant
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
pleasant
and
this
is
more
drinkable
than
any
9
99
beer
has
a
right
to
be
overall
this
beer
is
a
little
top
heavy
with
the
sweetness
but
ill
be
damned
if
its
not
an
entirely
enjoyable
beer
d
very
high
abv
and
too
much
flavor
for
me
to
session
although
i
managed
three
on
thanksgiving
the
flavors
open
up
more
as
it
warms
so
i
would
recommend
sipping
it
in
all
this
is
pretty
good
i
remember
i
had
this
last
year
at
at
bodega
i
wouldnt
have
many
qualms
with
drinking
this
again
mouthfeeldrinkability
a
bit
chewey
in

alcohol
is
big
but
not
overstated
here
a
pretty
delicious
beer
and
i
do
plan
to
drink
more
of
this
i
cant
believe
this
beer
is
9
9
abv
seeing
as
i
sip
them
like
wine
coolers
on
the
daily
there
is
only
one
store
in
my
set
that
carries
them
and
i
buy
him
out
of
stock
in
singles
regularly
beautiful
red
tint
smooth
going
down
high
class
no
matter
how
you
look
at
it
d
the
drinkability
is
very
good
for
what
it
is
i
think
i
could
drink
it
like
an
8
beer
rather
than
a
10
i
really
do
notice
the
alcohol
as
it
warms
but
the
well
blended
roasty
nutty
and
brown
sugar
notes
really
keep
you
interested
for
12
of
em
pretty
damn
good
to
me
i
would
definitely
buy
this
one
again
for
sure
very
enjoyable
cheers
im
very
impressed
by
how
well
hidden
the
alcohol
is
in
this
brew
overall
its
awesome
ill
be
sure
to
take
my
time
with
this
even
though
i
feel
as
though
i
could
drink
it
within
15
minutes
drinkability
with
an
abv
this
high
this
is
a
sipping
and
savoring
beer
for
me
but
it
did
go
well
with
a
roast
beef
burrito
for
dinner
while
i
can
feel
the
alcohol
a
bit
about
halfway
down
the
glass
this
beer
is
so
smooth
and
tasty
i
could
see
myself
fooled
into
another
one
if
i
didnt
know
it
was
this
high
of
an
abv
content
a
dangerously
drinkable
beer
good
beer
to
warm
you
for
the
winter
months
the
hops
are
strong
but
balanced
d
the
large
amount
of
hops
in
this
one
seems
out
of
place
but
this
is
a
brewery
that
loves
to
overhop
things
i
bet
this
one
gets
even
better
with
a
few
years
on
it
a
great
value
at
9
99sixer
on
this
one
too
strong
to
think
about
more
than
one
at
a
time
dthis
is
quite
drinkable
for
such
a
big
beer
at
9
99
overly
pedantic
measures
and
a
good
value
nice
that
is
bottled
in
12
oz
six
packs
had
this
on
tap
at
the
beautiful
farmers
market
in
los
angeles
pours
a
copper
brown
colour
with
a
finger
of
thick
white
head
leaving
lacing
down
the
glass
smells
of
brown
sugar
no
surprise
with
a
lot
of
nuttiness
and
mild
hops
i
typed
in
mold
hops
in
my
iphone
but
im
pretty
sure
i
meant
mild
quite
a
refreshing
beer
which
is
surprising
when
i
came
on
here
and
saw
this
is
listed
as
10
its
really
a
great
beer
worth
8
a
six
pack
d
high
on
alcohol
interrupts
the
complexity
a
bit
the
hops
cuts
through
the
flavor
profile
however
the
hops
is
a
nice
flavor
very
sweet
in
the
aftertaste
a
sipper
for
sure
clear
copper
to
bronze
pour
with
nice
white
head
and
good
retention
this
beer
has
a
strong
sweet
smell
and
this
smell
followed
through
into
the
taste
candied
sugars
vanilla
toffee
and
some
butterscotch
this
is
a
well
balanced
beer
medium
body
and
a
bit
dry
i
am
not
the
biggest
fan
of
sweet
beers
but
this
one
was
decent
and
as
usual
lagunitas
consistently
puts
out
good
beers
drinkability
was
pretty
good
for
10
percent
this
beer
was
dangerously
smooth
i
had
really
high
expectations
for
this
beer
which
unfortunately
werent
met
flavors
were
good
but
nothing
stood
out
and
made
this
beer
memorable
reminded
me
of
a
less
flavorful
version
of
old
gnarlywine
the
strong
malt
flavor
starts
in
right
away
but
the
sweetness
is
blunted
by
stellar
pacific
northwest
hops
caramel
and
toasted
flavors
predominate
early
but
the
finish
is
mostly
oily
pine
no
lack
of
flavor
here
and
very
easy
to
down
despite
being
a
ten
percenter
the
texture
is
smooth
and
supple
and
very
impressive
to
handle
such
a
plethora
of
flavors
this
one
is
not
for
everybody
but
those
that
like
seriously
high
octane
will
like
this
shugga
overall
this
is
a
curious
brew
so
drinkable
and
deceptive
that
it
should
come
with
a
warning
sign
im
going
to
definitely
pick
up
another
12
or
so
of
these
saving
half
to
enjoy
with
a
little
age
to
see
how
it
changes
i
tried
it
last
year
and
was
happy
to
see
it
back
on
the
shelves
im
sure
ill
be
happy
to
see
it
next
year
too
amber

with

you
dont

of

would
buy
again
and

12

bottle
pours
a
very
clear
amber
with
minimal
head
and
no

though
the
beer
is
so
syrupy
it
sticks
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
has
a
barleywine
style
smell
with
dark
fruits
like
raisins
to
begin
with
this
aroma
is
chased
by
loads
of
brown
sugar
notes
tasting
the
beer
for
the
first
time
you
immediately
notice
the
thick
mouthfeel
though
its
not
unpleasant
brown
shugga
is
full
bodied
with
minimal
carbonation
alcohol
is
cleverly
hidden
save
for
a
little
bit
of
a
burn
down
in
your
chest
after
you
drink
it
the
taste
has
a
lot
of
different
things
going
on
there
are
some
minor
fruit
notes
but
for
me
this
is
a
lot
like
waffles
and
maple
syrup
mild
citrus
hops
help
lend
balance
to
the
beer
oddly
enough
even
with
all
of
the
sugary
notes
this
finishes
quite
dry
which
leaves
you
wanting
more
despite
the
heavy
body
its
really
easy
drinking
call
it
the
perfect
fall
beer
moreys
bottom
line
reminds
me
of
bigfoot
a
bit
i
was
not
at
all
let
down
by
this
beer
a
fantastic
barleywine
that
is
a
solid
winter
seasonal
for
hopheads
to
snag
a
sixer
of
12oz
bottle
served
in
my
dt
tulip
pours
a
beautiful
burnt
redcopper
with
a
loose
half
inch
tancolored
head
that
reduces
its
volume
by
half
in
less
than
a
minute
before
eventually
settling
into
a
swirl
and
a
band
clarity
is
translucent

is
a
little
difficult
to
decipher
sweet

a
slight
vinegary
quality
and
maybe
a
trace
of
soy
sauce
taste
follows
nose
definitely
getting
that
salty
soy
sauce
flavor
following
the
maltybrown
sugar
start
theres
also
a
light
hops
presence
that
helps
balance
out
the
sweetness
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
with
a
slightly
oily
quality
and
an
easy
even
carbonation
not
sure
how
i
feel
about
this
one
its
not
bad
and
i
would
certainly
try
it
again
but
its
not
what
i
would
consider
exemplary
overall
this
is
a
very
nicely
balanced
brew
though
the
hops
are
bid
and
up
front
the
malts
and
sweet
sugga
are
present
and
make
this
a
nice
flavorful
brew
lagunitas
continues
to
amaze
me
several
bar
patrons
told
me
this
is
the
best
version
over
the
last
several
years
not
as
sweet
and
hops
tones
down
from
years
past
notes
there
could
have
been
a
lot
of
things
that
went
wrong
with
this
brew
but
everything
is
nicely
balanced
ive
always
liked
lagunitas
lineup
of
big
beers
but
theyve
earned
my
respect
with
this
one
sweeetttt
someone
talked
in
a
forum
post
about
pumpkin
ales
about
a
bartender
rimming
the
glass
with
brown
sugar
i
think
this
one
more
qualifies
great
beer
drinkability
overall
this
beer
is
pretty
drinkable
despite
its
big
9
9
punch
its
got
maybe
a
touch
much
on
the
hop
end
for
me
and
maybe
would
of
like
to
seen
kick
more
of
malt
too
but
overall
its
decent
beer
but
falls
short
of
what
i
would
call
great
would
be
interesting
to
try
with
a
bit
of
age
on
this
beer
one
thing
i
do
start
to
notice
though
is
alot
of
the
lagunitas
beers
im
starting
to
feel
do
taste
quite
the
same
not
a
bash
but
just
hey
im
starting
to
see
that
would
certainly
have
this
beer
again
though
like
i
said
would
need
to
keep
in
mind
that
it
is
a
10
beer
let
this
one
sit
too
for
at
least
a
couple
of
years
d
easily
drinkable
despite
the
abv
well
disguised
in
the
beer
surprisingly
wellbalanced
and
not
as
onedimensional
as
many
d
high
for
the
abv
i
enjoy
this
a
lot
and
will
be
looking
around
for
similar
beers
as
winter
rolls
in
a
very
balanced
beer
for
this
season
pours
a
deep
orangish
bronzeamber
thick
three
inch
solid
white
head
and
big
lacing
very
malty
and
sweet
smelling
caramel
brown
sugar
and
molasses
on
top
of
a
fresh
bread
smell
taste
is
also
malty
sweet
malt
caramel
toffee
and
molasses
on
top
of
a
thick
substantial
bicuity
body
all
this
sweetness
is
cut
by
a
spicy
herbal
hoppy
kick
at
the
finish
its
still
more
bready
and
sweet
than
bitter
though
i
can
feel
some
alcohol
burn
on
on
my
lips
the
mouthfeel
is
very
satisfying
thick
creamy
and
chewy
this
is
a
big
beer
with
good
complex
flavors
with
the
thick
sweet
bready
body
combined
with
the
abv
it
doesnt
drink
very
easy
i
would
have
a
hard
time
drinking
multiple
bottles
at
the
same
time
i
guess
at
10
your
not
supposed
to
d
i
gave
this
one
a
lower
rating
here
just
because
i
didnt
particularly
love
it
its
a
good
example
of
the
style
but
i
felt
there
were
too
many
strong
sensations
competing
to
really
enjoy
it
definitely
worth
trying
at
the
very
least
the
sweetness
becomes
a
bit
cloying
but
lagunitas
did
an
excellent
job
of
balancing
the
flavors
in
this
beer
and
the
alcohol
is
almost
undetectable
very
nice
to
sip
on
a
winter
evening
d
very
heavy
and
high
in
alcohol
so
you
might
want
to
stop
at
2
i
do
enjoy
this
beer
so
much
i
think
i
can
drink
it
all
night
though
d
all
around
good
beer
i
could
drink
100
of
these
im
not
the
biggest
fan
of
sweet
beers
but
this
one
is
firing
with
all
six
pistons
sweet
and
roasty
malt
highly
bitter
and
aromatic
hops
syrupy
body
alcohol
heat
its
call
brown
shugga
with
good
reason
but
it
has
great
balance
not
the
most
exciting
beer
out
there
but
highly
highly
sessionable
also
it
doesnt
hurt
that
its
a
great
winter
warmer
taste
is
malty
sweet
and
some
good
hops
very
creamy
on
the
tongue
and
really
a
nice
beer
to
drink
somehow
this
came
across
as
a
little
watery
overall
it
is
a
good
refreshing
beer
d
a
unique
take
but
not
sure
that
its
making
me
really
want
to
come
back
for
more
glad
i
tried
it
but
thats
about
as
far
as
it
goes
d
very
drinkable
especially
for
the
abv
once
again
another
beer
i
love
from
lagunitas
i
have
yet
to
be
disappointed
bottle
pours
a
reddish
orange
with
a
thin
off
white
head
that
settles
to
a
ring
smell
is
sugar
cinnamon
cough
syrupalcohol
fruity
hops
taste
is
very
sweet
off
the
bat
red
licorice
and
boozy
sugars
has
an
artificial
candy
sweetness
that
has
a
bit
of
bitterness
in
the
finish
the
sweetness
of
the
beer
really
masks
most
of
the
other
elements
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
medium
carbonation
not
too
sticky
and
a
bit
coating
as
far
as
american
strong
ales
go
this
is
one
of
the
most
drinkable
i
think
i
would
prefer
to
put
this
in
an
imperial
red
category
very
tasty
and
smooth
overall
excellent
beer
overall
i
would
highly
recommend
this
one
this
is
yet
another
great
beer
from
lagunitas
im
starting
to
think
that
they
can
do
no
wrong
d
how
in
the
world
is
this
9
99
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
but
enjoyable
overall
this
a
tasty
beer
and
although
its
a
bit
unbalanced
its
a
must
try
its
original
and
refreshing
and
a
great
autumn
beer
bottle
pours
a
clear
reddish
amber
medium
offwhite
head
fine
bubbles
low
carbonation
with
attractive
lacing
sweet
fermented
orange
aroma
with
some
strange
mustiness
the
flavor
is
initially
bitter
which
i
like
but
quickly
dissolves
into
a
candylike
syrupy
blend
of
flavors
the
hops
come
on
strong
at
the
end
texture
is
thick
and
heavy
good
body
decent
mouthfeel
just
a
bit
too
sugary
sweet
imho
i
should
have
taken
a
clue
from
the
name
huh
d
you
can
drink
one
of
these
down
no
problem
but
one
is
going
to
do
it
for
you
unless
youre
aiming
to
get
drunk
d
this
is
a
nice
beer
the
brown
sugar
is
obviously
meant
to
compliment
the
flavor
rather
than
define
it
a
good
accompaniment
to
a
chilly
fall
night
drinability
in
spite
of
the
odd
little
idontknowwhat
this
is
still
a
rather
drinkable
beer
overall
a
solid
brew
especially
for
the
price
point
not
surprising
for
a
lagunitas
brew
a
month
or
so
might
do
this
wonders
but
fresh
is
a
nice
balance
of
hop
and
malt
d
considering
the
abv
this
drinkability
is
dangerous
the
high
alcohol
and
sugary
taste
makes
this
more
of
a
sipper
for
me
despite
what
the
label
says
to
the
contrary
life
is
uncertain
dont
sip
one
at
a
time
is
enough
for
me
d
great
beer
ill
be
buying
a
lot
of
this
in
the
future
another
home
run
by
lagunitas
i
could
drunk
this
all
day
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
from
the
motherland
lagunitas
into
my
zatec
fluted
glass
nice
firm
2
fingers
of
tan
head
good
retention
and
nice
sticky
icky
lacing
smells
floral
sweet
malt
a
bit
of
duncan
hines
brownies
sweet
up
front
on
the
palate
finishes
earthy
and
bitter
dangerous
10
beer
johnny
dangerous
this
beer
pours
a
very
nice
reddish
brown
that
has
a
nice
fluffy
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
leaving
some
lacing
on
the
glass
there
is
a
nice
transparency
to
this
beer
that
i
didnt
really
expect
it
looks
greath
in
the
light
though
it
smells
like
brown
sugar
molasses
caramel
and
some
citrus
fruit
notes
like
lemon
and
orange
there
is
also
a
very
nice
hoppy
smell
to
this
mmmm
gotta
love
it
the
taste
is
nice
and
hoppy
up
front
with
a
definite
alcohol
kick
it
is
also
cut
by
a
nice
brown
sugary
sweetness
that
works
very
well
there
are
also
notes
of
molasses
caramel
butterscotch
and
some
subtle
citrus
notes
this
has
a
good
mouthfeel
goes
down
smooth
and
has
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
nice
medium
body
on
this
that
gives
it
almost
a
creamy
texture
i
think
the
drinkability
is
good
on
this
one
i
would
love
to
have
a
bunch
of
these
around
to
break
out
whenever
i
wanted
the
alcohol
kick
was
more
than
i
expected
but
i
think
it
was
a
pleasant
surprise
i
also
thought
that
it
was
going
to
be
much
sweeter
than
it
was
and
im
glad
i
was
wrong
i
think
this
was
perfect
the
way
that
they
did
it
good
job
lagunitas
cheers
mouthfeel
was
thinner
than
expected
for
such
a
big
beer
nice
easy
to
drink
it
would
be
dangerous
to
drink
a
few
of
these
but
they
would
go
down
quite
easy
hazy
brownamber
pour
with
a
thin
and
foamy
offwhite
head
thin
spotty
lacing
as
well
the
aroma
is
hoppy
with
sweet
dark
fruit
and
molasses
coming
through
more
as
it
warms
the
labeling
on
this
one
really
threw
me
off
as
i
was
expecting
more
of
a
sweet
brown
ale
once
my
taste
buds
told
me
it
was
actually
a
barley
wine
i
was
able
to
accept
the
flavor
very
hoppy
on
the
front
end
along
with
some
alcohol
burn
the
flavor
mellows
a
bit
as
sweet
malt
start
to
seep
in
the
finish
is
round
and
fruity
with
an
alcohol
burn
leftover
above
average
and
kind
of
unique
d
like
it
says
on
the
bottle
its
like
feeding
raw
shark
to
your
gerbil
this
beer
was
young
and
could
use
some
aging
would
love
to
get
my
hands
on
some
barrelaged
bs
though
fullmedium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
for
a
beer
approaching
10
abv
this
drinks
pretty
well
drinkability
this
is
a
sipper
for
sure
the
sweetness
prevents
me
from
craving
another
but
this
is
a
decent
beverage
worth
trying
a
good
beer
i
think
it
will
age
well
thbe
hops
will
subside
and
perhaps
reveal
other
layers
and
reduce
prevalence
of
the
abv
overall
an
decent
cool
season
beer
with
a
unique
sweet
malty
flavor
but
dont
plan
on
drinking
more
than
one
or
two
because
both
the
sweetness
and
the
abv
creepy
up
on
you
drinkability
is
great
this
is
something
meant
to
be
sipped
of
course
despite
the
very
hidden
abv
but
at
the
same
time
a
few
in
a
night
wouldnt
be
a
bad
thing
not
the
most
drinkable
beer
due
to
its
sweetness
but
rock
solid
like
most
lagunitas
brews
enjoyable
but
nothing
i
could
buy
again
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
a
crisp
amount
of
carbonation
overall
i
liked
it
as
i
seem
to
with
all
of
lagunitas
offerings
i
have
tried
less
than
most
but
it
grew
on
me
as
i
finished
the
bottle
dquite
enjoyable
the
whole
way
through
i
very
much
wish
to
have
another
i
know
i
will
some
day
soon
i
can
see
myself
coming
back
to
this
beer
frequently
lagunitas
is
quickly
becoming
my
favorite
brewery
everything
i
have
had
is
fantastic
if
you
see
this
or
any
other
lagunitas
beer
pick
it
up
and
enjoy
o
different
than
what
i
had
expected
though
i
enjoyed
it
and
feel
its
a
good
example
of
an
asa
too
cloyingly
sweet
for
my
tastes
overwhelmingly
so
to
the
exclusion
of
any
other
background
flavors
if
you
lived
on
capn
crunch
as
a
kid
give
this
one
a
try
d
the
residual
sugar
and
the
alcohol
make
this
a
sipping
beer
while
the
sweetness
makes
it
hard
for
me
to
finish
overall
while
an
interesting
beer
its
probably
not
something
i
would
buy
again
its
worth
a
try
and
its
a
great
experiment
but
the
finished
product
just
doesnt
fit
together
well
3

not
sure
if
its
complex
enough
for
its
size
and
the
astringency
is
a
bit
imbalancing
note
second
bottle
tried
a
couple
months
later
did
not
strike
me
as
imbalanced
but
its
good
and
better
than
i
remembered
actually
not
unlike
a
good
barleywine
minus
the
dates
and
other
dark
fruits
i
like
in
m
barleywines
but
i
wouldnt
be
surprised
if
this
one
grows
on
me
note
the
second
time
did
seem
better
than
the
first
the
beer
is
actually
not
hard
to
drink
compared
to
the
strength
and
i
think
the
alcohol
at
the
end
actually
helps
balance
it
much
like
hops
would
in
a
stronger
ale
overall
i
never
really
know
how
sum
up
strong
ales
they
dont
really
have
a
certain
criteria
to
base
an
opinion
on
i
love
barley
wines
and
this
reminds
me
of
one
i
gues
that
means
i
like
it
a
tasty
brew
that
is
really
enjoyable
and
doesnt
take
too
much
thought
because
of
its
simplicity
ill
definitely
grab
some
the
next
time
it
comes
out
d
man
i
think
i
still
have
a
few
places
around
and
can
get
them
usually
for
around
23
dollars
a
bottle
i
will
see
this
again
next
year
if
i
had
another
couple
of
bottles
thered
be
no
second
thoughts
whatsoever
finishing
all
three
have
no
idea
of
the
age
of
the
cask
o
great
beer
im
jealous
of
those
of
you
who
have
this
as
a
seasonal
local
it
reminds
me
of
a
scotch
ale
with
a
bigger
hop
profile
it
is
however
a
fairly
simple
beer
not
much
going
on
inside
poured
a
clear
brown
mahogany
with
a
thin
off
white
head
but
laced
well
the
entire
glass
a
sugar
malty
sweet
aroma
with
a
hint
of
molasses
sweet
malty
burnt
carmel
on
the
tongue
with
a
slight
hoppy
finish
medium
body
with
nice
carbonation
very
drinkable
d
a
very
drinkable
beer
but
beware
of
the
high
9
84
abv
on
board
which
is
very
well
hidden
but
will
certainly
catch
up
if
you
are
not
careful
nice
beer
i
like
it
is
a
sipper
due
to
the
detectable
and
warming
booze
as
well
as
the
almostoverwhelming
sweetness
borders
on
being
a
mess
but
pulls
through
with
some
pleasant
complexity
in
a
pretty
unique
beer
i
love
this
beer
partially
because
i
love
a
sweet
beer
from
time
to
time
its
really
easy
to
drink
despite
the
abv
which
i
think
is
a
little
more
masked
ontap
d
so
so
drinkable
the
awesomely
complex
flavor
and
the
unique
texture
leave
you
wanting
more
and
more
truth
be
told
it
is
tasting
like
an
american
style
barleywine
minus
some
hops
and
maybe
a
different
yeast
strain
i
love
lagunitas
brewing
style
but
i
cant
see
drinking
more
than
one
of
these
at
a
time
winter
warmer
yep
campfire
beer
yep
definitely
worth
a
try
to
drink
something
different
a
drinkable
brew
but
it
is
a
bit
too
sweet
for
anything
except
a
dessert
beer
or
nightcap
the
alcohol
is
not
noticeable
but
at
9
84
percent
it
will
become
apparent
what
can
i
say
if
you
go
into
a
beer
called
brown
shugga
that
boasts
of
its
intense
sugary
sweetness
without
a
sweet
tooth
youre
kind
of
a
moron
the
day
i
tried
this
beer
i
was
that
moron
i
can
tell
that
this
is
a
welldone
beer
if
you
like
this
flavor
profile
i
dont
md
medium
to
full
bodied
and
a
surprisingly
strong
carbonation
very
easy
drinking
given
the
high
abv
hardly
noticeable
in
the
taste
d
this
is
a
very
well
balanced
and
enjoyable
ale
would
never
guess
that
the
abv
is
almost
10
the
sweetness
becomes
a
little
too
much
after
getting
the
bottom
of
the
glass
theres
a
very
good
flavor
in
this
beer
its
smooth
creamy
medium
bodied
full
of
sweet
caramel
toasted
oats
belgian
yeasts
roasted
malts
oak
and
a
small
amount
of
hops
the
aftertaste
has
some
nice
fruit
notes
but
still
cant
figure
out
the
fruit
a
very
good
and
staplelike
beer
from
lagunitas
pours
a
dark
golden
brown
with
a
light
rim
of
head
carbonation
seemed
appropriate
the
smell
was
a
nice
mix
of
resinous
hops
and
sweet
malty
goodness
which
i
would
have
enjoyed
more
if
not
for
the
whiff
of
alcohol
that
came
along
with
it
taste
was
of
strong
american
hops
more
citrusy
that
i
would
have
expected
with
gentle
brown
sugar
flavor
and
a
warm
flush
of
alcohol
you
could
feel
in
the
belly
very
nice
drinker
pours
a
copper
amber
brown
cloudy
and
many
a
floater
very
little
head
smells
sweet
and
fruity
grapefruit
and
pineapple
the
taste
is
sweet
and
slightly
bitter
this
is
goood
a
delicious
mistake
by
the
lagunitas
crew
im
tasting
enough
fruit
grapefruit
and
pineapple
top
remind
me
of
sunday
brunch
there
is
a
little
bit
of
toffee
or
butterscotch
taste
too
slightly
salty
you
really
dont
catch
how
much
alcohol
is
in
this
brew
until
you
get
towards
the
end
or
you
look
at
the
bottle
in
other
words
it
is
not
at
all
obvious
to
me
that
i
am
getting
drunk
right
now
this
stuff
is
gooood
d
a
wonderfully
drinkable
and
delicious
strong
ale
the
assault
of
flavor
reveals
its
strength
but
there
is
very
little
trace
of
actual
heat
the
whole
thing
comes
off
in
part
because
of
the
words
on
the
packaging
as
a
beautiful
accident
would
definitely
pick
up
again
pours
a
great
deep
brown
with
slight
reddish
hues
small
tan
head
leaves
nice
laces
around
the
glass
looks
delicious
whiff
prepour
is
surprisingly
filled
with
hops
not
so
much
after
in
the
glass
once
in
the
glass
its
pretty
much
all
sweet
brown
sugar
in
the
nose
taste
on
this
is
an
almost
overwhelming
sweetness
nice
malty
backbone
that
has
a
slight
hop
bitterness
lingering
in
the
background
feel
is
slick
and
oily
not
heavy
at
all
for
such
a
big
beer
dangerously
drinkable
especially
if
you
happen
to
have
a
sweet
tooth
how
come
you
taste
so
good
i
cannot
place
why
i
have
not
reviewed
this
beer
yet
this
must
be
my
fifth
sixer
in
the
past
year
and
by
far
one
of
my
favorites
i
will
not
lie
the
awesomeness
by
volume
is
what
drew
me
to
this
beer
the
first
time
it
is
by
far
the
taste
that
kept
me
coming
back
i
almost
gave
a
poor
review
this
time
due
to
the
fact
that
i
drank
it
straight
from
the
fridge
however
this
beer
is
certainly
served
best
cool
not
cold
the
sweetness
a
factor
i
typically
do
not
agree
with
is
the
factor
that
makes
this
beer
so
intriguing
to
me
i
thoroughly
enjoy
the
heavy
mouthfeel
the
heavy
alcohol
and
the
dirty
finish
this
beer
gives
me
that
damn
dog
has
done
it
again
and
i
want
it
to
do
it
again
and
again
i
rate
this
one
the
top
of
my
list
right
next
to
1554
but
remember
to
pack
a
toothbrush
if
you
arent
drinking
it
at
home
the
alcohol
is
too
high
for
you
to
drive
home
and
the
stoutness
of
the
ale
will
make
your
teeth
feeling
like
they
are
wearing
sweaters
the
next
morning
like
the
bottle
says
life
is
uncertain
dont
sip
d
overall
an
excellent
full
bodied
beer
very
complex
big
time
malty
sweetness
balanced
by
a
heafty
dose
of
hops
a
quality
offering
for
sure
and
i
will
try
and
pick
some
up
next
winter
drinkability
is
way
to
easy
for
this
monster
where
is
the
9
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
sam
adams
pint
glass
the
beer
is
a
crystal
clear
dark
brown
with
a
light
fizzy
head
that
fades
away
pretty
quickly
the
aroma
is
malay
sweet
with
notes
of
alcohol
taste
is
similar
although
the
added
brown
sugar
definitely
ups
the
sweetness
factor
i
was
a
little
disappointed
with
this
one
until
i
realized
that
it
was
around
10
percent
and
the
fellows
at
lagunitas
had
done
a
pretty
good
job
balancing
the
many
aspects
of
this
brew
overall
the
more
i
drank
of
this
the
more
i
found
myself
enjoying
it
funny
how
that
works
d
a
sweeter
and
tasty
beer
that
i
can
see
myself
purchasing
again
in
the
future
i
bought
this
around
christmas
time
and
to
me
this
seems
like
a
good
beer
for
the
holidays
brown
shugga
is
as
sweet
and
tantalizing
as
it
sounds
most
beers
of
this
style
and
strength
drink
with
a
callousing
nerve
and
stiff
backbone
this
one
melts
over
the
palate
with
tender
pulses
and
delicate
jitter
if
only
everyone
had
as
much
reason
to
be
proud
of
what
they
do
as
the
people
at
lagunitas
brewing
what
a
world
that
would
be
from
hearing
people
talk
i
thought
this
would
be
super
sweet
but
i
think
it
had
a
pretty
good
balance
like
a
malty
barleywine
2004
vintage
bottle
city
beer
store
ok
so
this
isnt
how
the
beer
normally
tastes
but
i
enjoyed
it
and
ill
go
back
for
a
normal
review
sometime
there
was
no
real
hop
aroma
or
flavor
at
this
point
the
beer
is
pretty
much
a
sweet
malt
bomb
it
actually
reminded
me
of
a
doppelbock
to
some
extent
theres
a
big
sugary
caramel
flavor
that
dominates
the
beer
has
taken
on
some
light
sherry
notes
the
body
is
beginning
to
thin
out
but
it
seems
to
be
holding
up
against
time
better
than
the
gnarleywine
oddly
the
caramel
malt
and
brown
sugar
sweetness
arent
quite
as
overpowering
or
simplistic
as
you
might
expect
the
flavor
is
round
and
full
without
being
cloying
very
nice
between
avery
dfh
and
lagunitas
what
a
great
lot
keep
them
coming
lagunitas
d
its
a
solid
beer
but
experimental
quite
sweet
with
lots
of
root
beer
flavor
and
a
nice
thick
mouthfeel
what
a
completely
unexpected
treat
this
one
was
clear
coppery
chestnut
color
creamy
offwhite
head
good
retention
and
lacing
smell
is
sweet
carmel
brown
sugar
lightly
roasted
nuts
with
a
touch
of
dark
fruit
and
yeast
on
the
nose
bold
sweet
carmel
and
brown
sugar
flavors
with
a
more
pronounced
and
bitter
hop
presence
then
the
smell
let
on
touches
of
fruit
and
yeast
on
the
finish
full
bodied
heavy
on
the
tounge
like
melted
carmel
itself
fairly
pronounced
sweet
and
bitter
aftertastes
good
beer
stops
short
of
being
cloying
but
would
be
hard
to
have
more
than
one
a
pretty
good
beer
that
has
a
terrible
name
to
date
ive
thought
it
was
a
brown
ale
wrong
this
is
quite
hoppy
and
the
name
deceives
d
not
more
than
an
occasional
treat
perhaps
it
is
the
beer
equivalent
of
candy
or
dessert
for
the
price
of
this
beer
less
than
2
for
a
12oz
bottle
locally
its
hard
to
find
another
beer
this
big
and
full
of
flavor
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
drinkability
is
average
its
too
sweet
for
it
to
be
that
drinkable
it
was
a
decent
tasting
beer
to
have
one
of
but
its
a
little
too
sweet
and
high
in
alcohol
to
have
much
of
d
a
decent
brew
but
not
something
id
drink
over
over
again
a
bit
too
cloyingly
sweet
while
making
you
want
it
more
is
not
a
good
combo
w
a
9
8
abv
brew
imo
drinkability
excellently
drinkable
if
you
find
the
bittersweet
taste
to
your
liking
as
previously
mentioned
the
stength
of
the
beer
is
hardly
noticeable
mostly
due
to
the
other
striking
components
at
nearly
10
this
beer
is
more
drinkable
than
many
beers
far
weaker
a
mediumfull
body
but
surprisingly
light
and
clean
considering
the
high
abv
and
the
sweetness
for
how
sweet
this
is
i
dont
find
it
cloying
at
all
rather
it
is
smooth
and
quite
easy
drinking
the
overall
taste
of
the
beer
was
very
smooth
it
was
very
drinkable
could
easily
sit
there
and
before
i
know
need
another
one
which
is
impressive
for
a
9
plus
abv
it
was
hoppy
but
also
sweet
the
sweetness
is
probably
why
this
9
plus
beer
is
so
easy
to
drink
poured
into
a
sam
adams
glass
great
clear
copper
color
with
a
big
off
white
fluffy
head
that
quickly
goes
into
a
thin
film
with
minor
lacing
aroma
of
cotton
candy
and
caramel
malt
the
taste
took
me
by
surprise
i
was
expecting
a
super
sweet
brew
and
the
first
mouthful
was
sweet
like
toffee
as
i
progressed
it
did
not
seem
as
sweet
and
i
was
starting
to
feel
the
burn
of
alcohol
it
really
goes
down
easy
though
and
that
could
be
dangerous
considering
the
abv
for
me
smooth
to
drink
but
a
thick
body
drinkable
and
sippable
at
the
same
time
take
your
pick
this
is
good
stuff
the
taste
comes
with
a
initial
sense
of
hoppiness
that
is
then
overwhelmed
by
the
sense
of
sweetness
alcohol
is
pretty
well
hidden
by
the
sweetness
and
the
mouthfeel
straddles
a
fine
line
between
creaminess
sweetness
and
hop
bite
all
in
all
pretty
pleasant
and
pretty
easy
to
drink
for
a
10er
much
like
the
hopslam
i
had
in
the
same
sitting
worth
checking
out
and
pretty
reasonably
priced
the
mouthfeel
is
heavy
and
sugary
brown
shugga
duh
some
alcohol
hints
but
not
too
harsh
overall
a
smooth
tasting
and
complex
beer
had
this
on
tap
at
old
chicago
in
uptown
and
also
have
had
it
from
bottle
reviews
is
from
tap
serving
which
i
preferred
it
came
a
beautiful
auburn
brown
color
with
a
minimal
head
and
a
beige
ring
with
some
sticky
lacing
i
had
to
let
this
ale
warm
as
it
was
served
to
cold
as
it
warmed
i
could
smell
molasses
and
caramel
and
hops
some
brown
sugar
of
course
the
taste
was
not
as
good
as
the
smell
i
got
to
much
of
an
alcohol
hit
first
then
the
citrus
and
molasses
and
all
the
b4
mentioned
taste
played
to
much
of
a
secondary
role
the
ale
was
still
solid
maybe
i
drank
it
to
cold
to
get
all
the
layers
of
flavor
again
still
a
solid
offering
from
langunitas
i
just
like
maximus
and
hop
stoopid
better
drinkability
is
relatively
high
the
flavor
profile
is
pleasing
which
brings
me
back
for
more
the
abv
is
high
but
well
incorporated
i
just
dig
this
beer
wow
something
must
have
blown
up
here
with
the
recipe
not
sure
if
they
were
going
for
a
barlewyine
or
an
ipa
but
it
definitely
has
the
hoppiness
of
an
ipa
and
the
chewiness
of
a
barleywine
the
result
a
gnarly
beer
that
fights
with
you
every
sip
and
refuses
to
go
down
easily
a
rare
misstep
for
laguinitas
but
a
misstep
indeed
beer
is
medium
to
full
bodied
and
completely
sweet
i
guess
the
name
makes
sense
since
it
tastes
like
sugar
water
drinkability
is
moderate
and
mouthfeel
is
fine
there
is
almost
no
bitterness
i
bet
this
beer
is
meant
to
sit
on
the
shelf
of
some
cellar
for
10
years
before
its
very
drinkable
yeah
thats
what
i
think
the
color
is
a
deep
amberbrownish
with
a
small
cap
of
sandycolored
foam
pretty
good
retention
with
nice
sheets
of
creamy
lacing
the
aroma
is
unsurprisingly
sweet
with
a
nice
caramel
toffee
brown
sugar
quality
with
a
subtle
citrus
note
id
like
to
make
an
air
freshener
out
of
this
at
any
rate
the
flavor
is
superb
with
a
big
thick
caramelized
sugar
note
taking
the
lead
theres
a
sort
of
sweet
sticky
toffee
flavor
that
blends
nicely
with
caramel
brown
sugar
and
like
a
bright
red
fruity
center
not
overly
hoppy
but
there
is
definitely
something
there
the
finish
is
nicely
dry
with
citrus
and
pine
flavors
coming
into
the
mix
the
hops
do
a
really
good
job
of
keeping
the
sweet
malt
flavors
from
cloying
and
keeps
me
wanting
more
its
fullbodied
with
a
nice
warming
quality
but
never
feels
overwhelming
i
absolutely
loved
this
beer
probably
one
of
the
best
experiences
ive
had
with
a
beer
in
the
past
year
people
who
like
big
malty
beers
should
definitely
check
this
one
out
but
id
recommend
it
to
anybody
this
is
going
to
make
it
into
my
annual
winter
seasonal
haul
overall
this
certainly
and
interesting
offering
from
lagunitas
and
one
that
should
be
tried
by
fans
of
the
style
with
a
sweettooth
thanks
again
chuck
for
throwing
this
one
in
the
box
recommended
pretty
damn
good
and
different
really
tastes
like
an
ipa
with
maple
syrup
very
smooth
drinker
easy
to
wind
up
on
the
floor
with
this
one
nice
light
carbonation
that
complaments
the
texture
of
the
beer
well
very
big
taste
very
sweet
not
very
much
to
it
in
the
way
of
complexity
brown
sugar
a
little
citrusorange
and
a
nice
bitterness
this
is
my
first
review
i
liked
this
beer
it
had
a
great
pour
nice
head
in
a
red
wine
glass
some
lacing
but
not
much
the
first
sip
was
awsomse
it
is
thick
and
has
great
flavor
the
finish
was
bitter
and
had
a
it
of
pine
taste
to
it
i
could
really
feel
the
warmth
in
my
belly
when
it
hit
bottom
the
bitter
lingered
longer
than
i
like
overall
a
good
beer
for
the
price
d
it
provides
for
pretty
easy
drinking
doesnt
burn
when
it
goes
down
and
if
you
like
the
unique
taste
then
its
plausible
that
you
drink
this
sucker
all
night
i
like
this
a
lot
another
winner
from
lagunitas
both
in
originality
and
in
creating
a
satisfying
drink
the
flavors
make
for
what
would
be
a
goto
iipa
while
the
abv
does
not
this
proves
that
if
executed
correctly
brown
sugar
can
make
play
a
part
in
good
beer
another
surprise
brew
and
this
time
for
the
positive
nice
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
an
amber
color
with
a
small
head
smell
is
of
hops
and
alcohol
taste
is
very
hoppy
some
notes
of
sugar
and
alcohol
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
has
average
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
fairly
decent
brew
overall
i
love
when
lagunitas
brings
this
beer
out
once
a
year
and
its
unique
in
its
own
way
check
it
out
and
you
wont
be
disappointed
with
the
experience
notes
i
love
everything
this
beer
is
and
have
never
been
let
down
by
lagunitas
this
brew
has
a
very
fall
season
feel
particularly
the
north
east
where
i
live
its
apple
smell
mixed
with
the
sweetness
brings
to
mind
autumn
next
time
i
drink
this
in
the
sniffer
i
will
be
trying
this
beer
with
sliced
apple
and
some
sharp
cheddar
cheese
d
drank
way
too
well
for
such
a
high
abv
beer
nice
and
sweet
with
a
good
hop
presence
yes
please
for
dessert
so
i
guess
this
beer
originated
as
a
barleywine
gone
wrong
that
describes
the
catchall
american
strong
ale
designation
as
well
as
anything
else
ive
ever
heard
and
this
certainly
bounces
back
and
forth
like
a
pinball
between
the
bumpers
of
barleywine
american
strong
ale
and
double
ipa
whatever
it
is
its
excellent
and
highly
recommended
to
enthusiasts
of
stones
bastard
boys
d
insanely
drinkable
at
9
84
i
can
see
the
conparison
to
an
american
barleywine
highly
recommended
im
glad
this
is
available
in
my
neck
of
the
woods
i
think
i
may
throw
one
of
these
under
the
stairs
and
see
how
it
ages
that
being
said
this
is
a
good
beer
if
your
not
afraid
of
something
on
the
sweeter
side
worth
trying
for
sure
amber
orange
pour
slightly
hazy
theres
a
rich
malty
aroma
with
citrusy
notes
as
well
taste
is
sweet
initially
with
flavors
of
caramel
and
molasses
good
roasted
malt
character
and
some
lemony
hop
bitterness
to
round
out
the
flavor
this
coats
the
tongue
easy
and
has
a
hearty
mouthfeel
satisfying
without
feeling
too
heavy
for
a
beer
approaching
10
abv
this
is
easy
to
drink
lagunitas
seems
to
be
an
approachable
and
affordable
craft
option
d
a
rich
complex
and
interesting
beer
a
bit
too
rich
to
have
too
many
but
still
a
solid
beer
d
this
beer
is
phenomenal
for
a
sweet
lover
which
i
am
its
very
surprisingly
drinkable
and
tasty
d
a
good
beer
with
an
interesting
citrus
kick
i
wish
i
knew
the
age
on
this
cause
it
doesnt
taste
like
its
older
due
to
how
vibrant
the
citrus
fruits
are
definitely
would
have
this
again
though
the
beer
is
surprisingly
carbonated
for
an
american
strong
ale
and
the
hop
balance
to
all
the
sweetness
creates
a
nice
dry
finish
and
interesting
flavor
combination
this
reminds
me
of
an
aged
big
foot
definitely
a
lot
sweeter
but
the
mouthfeel
and
body
are
similar
for
me
this
is
a
beer
i
will
not
turn
down
in
the
future
the
strong
citrus
grapefruit
hops
cascade
maybe
do
well
to
balance
the
big
sugary
sweetness
and
this
is
a
very
unique
and
interesting
beer
with
character
that
may
not
appeal
to
someone
with
expectations
i
had
two
but
three
mightve
given
me
the
sickness
d
i
liked
this
one
a
lot
cant
believe
its
over
9
could
definitely
drink
a
few
of
these
tastewise
but
might
refrain
due
to
the
abv
definitely
think
its
worth
checking
out
md
mild
carbonation
and
a
fairly
smooth
but
the
finish
is
what
makes
this
not
particularly
great
here
a
little
too
bitter
for
my
taste
d
a
bit
high
in
alcohol
very
nice
hop
presence
and
the
brown
sugar
stickiness
is
a
definite
asset
drinkability
well
i
like
it
but
with
its
maltbombiness
and
its
high
abv
its
definitely
not
a
session
one
for
me
i
might
split
a
sixpack
three
ways
though
flavor
is
citrusy
hops
with
a
subtle
sweet
malt
back
alcohol
is
deceptivley
hidden
watch
out
because
it
sneaks
up
on
you
a
great
seasonal
brew
definitely
try
this
out
if
you
have
the
chance
at
least
once
drinkability
this
is
not
a
beer
that
one
would
drink
a
whole
six
pack
in
a
sitting
well
you
could
i
just
wouldnt
go
anywhere
afterwards
its
a
perfect
beer
for
cold
howling
brittle
winter
nights
drinkability
is
fantastic
the
high
abv
is
almost
undetected
while
showcasing
its
flavor
lagunitas
brown
shugga
was
recommended
to
me
by
nate
over
at
martys
in
newton
for
some
reason
the
name
of
this
beer
always
struck
me
as
gimmicky
but
oh
well
the
color
is
copper
and
has
a
small
amount
of
mildly
tan
head
the
nose
is
a
good
bit
hoppier
than
i
was
expecting
i
do
get
a
bit
of
brown
sugar
in
the
smell
along
with
some
caramel
and
grain
taste
is
again
hoppy
with
some
mint
leaf
and
a
really
raw
earth
character
body
is
medium
to
heavy
and
leaves
a
very
bitter
aftertaste
drinkability
is
hindered
a
bit
simply
by
the
fact
that
this
beer
is
complicated
as
i
was
told
at
the
store
this
is
a
challenging
one
on
the
bright
side
the
9
84
abv
can
barely
be
detected
maybe
not
among
the
best
from
lagunitas
but
certainly
interesting
and
worth
a
shot
cheers
d
great
considering
the
relatively
high
abv
showing
that
not
all
strong
ales
have
to
hit
you
like
double
bass
pedals
i
e
stone
great
beer
drinkability
not
even
a
hint
of
alcohol
i
could
easily
consume
a
few
bottles
of
this
and
probably
get
pretty
drunk
at
the
abv
i
wouldnt
care
though
it
is
almost
refreshing
for
its
abv
and
style
and
i
would
definitely
reach
for
another
if
i
had
one
i
will
be
getting
more
d
drinkability
is
definitely
a
highlight
of
this
one
have
to
watch
it
though
as
the
9
8
abv
could
bring
some
ill
effects
after
more
than
a
few
of
these
pours
a
caramelamber
color
with
a
good
size
off
white
creamy
head
and
good
lacing
smell
is
sweet
malty
brown
sugar
caramel
chocolate
oranges
cream
with
a
some
citrusy
hops
taste
is
sweet
with
lots
of
caramel
malt
brown
sugar
and
oranges
up
front
with
a
slightly
citrusy
hop
bitterness
on
the
end
kind
of
leaves
of
oranges
cream
aftertaste
medium
mouthfeel
easy
drinker
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
this
is
a
thinking
mans
beer
you
have
to
try
to
appreciate
each
sip
and
swirl
it
around
in
your
mouth
and
mind
will
not
turn
this
down
conclusion
here
finally
is
a
lagunitas
brew
that
really
really
impresses
me
d
way
too
drinkable
and
at
near
10
this
ones
dangerous
alcohol
is
hidden
very
well
so
read
your

pours
a
beautiful
deep
reddish
amber
color
with
small
rapidly
fading
head
that
leaves
some
lace
on
the
glass
smell
is
quite
sweet
with
some
of
the
brown
sugar
coming
to
play
with
citrus
hops
pleasant
though
taste
is
not
overwhelmingly
hoppy
or
malty
but
a
nice
balance
of
both
lightly
roasted
malt
kicks
things
off
here
followed
by
a
moderate
bitter
kick
from
some
hops
fading
into
a
lingering
piney
and
somewhat
smokey
flavor
very
interesting
not
nearly
as
sweet
as
i
would
have
expectedwas
thinking
this
was
gonna
be
like
dfh
90
in
the
sweetness
dept
very
interesting
flavor
akin
in
ways
to
both
english
and
american
barleywines
thick
and
coating
the
mf
on
this
one
is
great
very
smooth
and
fullbodied
it
says
not
to
sip
this
one
on
the
bottle
and
i
damn
well
could
get
away
with
not
sipping
this
one
nice
work
from
lagunitas
i
have
to
explore
this
brewery
further
poured
a
clear
copper
color
with
a
fluffy
white
head
fainter
than
expected
nose
some
definite
sweetness
going
on
but
the
hops
were
definitely
there
as
well
i
was
expecting
a
much
sweeter
taste
at
first
but
then
i
reminded
this
is
a
west
coast
barley
wine
and
should
be
treated
as
such
very
sweet
malts
up
front
the
brown
sugar
is
there
and
the
hops
take
control
of
the
lingering
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
phenomenal
on
this
one
velvety
smooth
this
was
a
great
beer
but
i
feel
as
though
it
should
be
cellared
for
a
few
years
to
mull
the
hop
flavor
a
bit
definitely
pick
this
one
up
if
you
see
it
d
this
is
pretty
fun
to
drink
with
the
variety
of
flavors
and
the
near
10abvhidden
well
doesnt
hurt
either
drink
this
in
moderation
dark
brown
body
34
finger
tan
head
nice
lacing
huge
sweetness
in
the
nose
which
masks
the
hops
taste
is
sweet
with
some
roasted
malts
present
a
bit
too
syrupy
for
me
not
the
most
drinkable
of
beers
at
this
abv
and
sweetness
though
i
must
note
two
years
of
cellaring
mellowed
out
the
alcohol
quite
a
bit
a
definite
late
night
sipper
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
this
beer
is
so
drinkable
for
the
gravity
and
is
is
smooth
on
the
backend
making
one
down
a
glass
faster
than
one
should
my
only
problem
with
this
easy
drinking
beer
is
the
slight
alcohol
bite
at
the
end
dings
it
a
little
on
the
drinkability
i
actually
think
that
alcohol
presence
is
needed
otherwise
id
down
too
many
of
these
in
too
fast
of
time
if
lagunitas
could
come
up
with
same
taste
profile
in
a
sessionable
strength
then
i
would
be
all
over
that
good
but
way
too
high
of
an
abv
and
way
too
much
sugar
i
first
tried
this
beer
last
year
thanks
to
an
old
coworker
from
starbucks
by
far
his
favorite
winter
beer
and
now
has
become
one
of
mine
i
am
starting
to
look
forward
to
seeing
it
on
the
shelves
every
winter
now
for
those
who
are
not
familiar
with
this
beer
it
started
out
as
a
rushed
recipe
for
their
gnarly
wine
ale
but
as
most
rushed
things
go
it
took
a
turn
off
course
so
they
added
mass
amounts
of
brown
sugar
to
try
to
speed
up
the
fermentation
process
the
end
result
turned
out
to
be
this
great
winter
beer
i
would
not
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
is
not
use
too
how
a
barley
wine
should
taste
but
for
those
who
enjoy
a
good
barley
wine
give
this
a
try
at
least
once
drinkability
a
solid
beer
that
is
one
per
sitting
for
the
high
abv
as
stated
above
the
sweetness
really
comes
out
as
the
beer
warms
i
will
look
for
this
again
md
i
enjoyed
this
brew
quite
a
bit
a
brew
i
can
drink
throughout
the
night
i
medium
bodied
brew
that
is
sweet
and
smooth
but
dry
at
the
end
a
good
well
rounded
brew
in
my
opinion
i
will
for
sure
have
again
another
seasonal
so
stock
up
if
you
can
find
it
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
tumbler
pours
a
reddishbrowncopper
with
little
head
that
dissipates
quickly
to
crown
the
beer
definite
sweet
aromas
of
malts
and
sugar
with
some
hoppy
citrus
grapefruit
aromas
as
well
taste
is
very
sweet
and
the
citrus
flavors
along
with
pine
dominate
the
flavors
feels
rather
light
really
compared
to
my
expectation
and
the
carbonation
is
rather
light
as
well
a
good
drinking
beer
that
could
be
pretty
sessionable
if
not
for
the
alcohol
content
oh
this
truly
be
a
great
beer
brown
shugga
is
brewed
with
just
that
brown
sugar
about
2
lbs
per
barrel
i
was
told
thats
the
first
thing
that
hit
me
about
his
beer
the
thick
molasses
feel
of
it
and
the
sweet
taste
the
aroma
is
almost
as
intoxicating
as
the
beer
over
10
abv
and
while
it
is
one
of
the
better
beers
ive
ever
tasted
i
could
not
drink
too
much
of
it
in
a
night
mainly
because
its
so
sweet
ad
so
strong
poured
with
a
great
head
fading
to
a
pretty
persistent
lace
good
dark
copper
hue
the
nose
is
pretty
amazing
with
lots
of
sweet
malts
hops
molasses
and
hints
of
brown
sugar
and
banana
tastes
like
an
unsweetened
bananas
foster
lots
of
caramel
brown
sugar
molasses
banana
while
the
alcohol
works
well
like
the
brandy
in
bananas
foster
the
hops
do
come
through
especially
on
the
finish
giving
it
a
drier
profile
simply
a
great
beer
and
one
i
wish
was
available
year
round
d
an
interesting
offering
from
lagunitas
that
hides
its
almost
10
abv
very
well
one
or
two
of
these
are
definitely
enough
but
its
quite
a
nice
winter
sipper
a
very
enjoyable
beer
and
surprisingly
drinkable
at
9
5
abv
d
a
decent
beer
that
could
be
better
if
the
alcohol
were
toned
down
a
bit
drink
is
good
abv
is
very
well
hidden
the
heavily
sweetness
with
the
bright
background
of
hops
just
make
this
an
amazing
drink
drink
up
folks
lagunitas
seems
to
be
the
hopheads
brewery
i
thought
this
would
be
not
really
sweeter
because
its
sweet
but
maybe
less
hoppy
awesome
stuff
thatll
sneak
up
on
you
if
you
arent
careful
overall
another
solid
offering
from
lagunitas
every
beer
they
make
has
that
lagunitas
hoppy
feel
to
it
and
this
one
is
no
exception
i
would
be
able
to
peg
this
as
a
lagunitas
brew
in
a
blind
tasting
no
problem
d
i
dont
know
about
this
one
i
do
not
find
either
the
taste
or
the
smell
overly
enticing
and
the
abv
while
not
too
strong
is
present
i
really
didnt
particularly
want
to
finish
the
whole
glass
and
dont
really
want
another
that
said
it
is
not
really
hard
to
drink
either
just
not
my
cup
of
tea
d
good
but
has
too
much
bitter
aftertaste
kind
of
a
juxtaposition
of
flavours
exuding
some
barleywine
dipa
and
brown
ale
characteristics
a
clear
bronzeamber
color
with
a
moderate
sized
tan
head
light
carbonation
spotty
lacing
aroma
of
caramel
malt
brown
shuggar
floral
and
citrus
hops
and
a
pale
malt
of
some
kind
flavor
is
quite
sweet
up
front
with
some
nice
floral
pine
and
citrus
hops
medium
bitterness
some
caramel
burnt
shuggar
and
broun
shugger
full
body
with
a
slightly
oily
mouthfeel
a
slightly
alcoholic
finish
very
drinkable
and
good
a
very
good
value
and
a
good
brew
all
around
sugar
sweet
with
a
hop
bite
to
keep
this
from
being
to
surupy
thick
and
rich
alcohol
is
hidden
very
well
i
was
suprised
to
see
it
at
such
a
high
abv
could
pound
several
of
these
if
i
wasnt
being
carfull
d
quite
a
kick
to
this
beer
nice
flavor
but
it
is
strong
kind
of
limits
the
drinkability
a
little
i
would
definitely
recommend
the
beer
but
not
more
than
a
few
in
one
sitting
i
want
to
see
what
one
of
these
would
taste
like
in
a
year
or
two
problem
is
they
wont
stay
in
my
house
that
long
because
i
cant
stop
drinking
the
damn
things
drinkability
quite
drinkable
especially
when
considering
the
intensity
of
flavors
a
very
interesting
different
beer
d
this
beer
sounds
all
to
good
but
is
just
way
too
sweet
for
my
palate
definately
a
big
beer
but
very
sweet
and
the
hops
are
super
bitter
making
for
a
very
dry
piney
finish
too
sweet
and
too
bitter
if
that
makes
sense
d
definitely
a
big
beer
that
doesnt
disguise
that
fact
fairly
harsh
on
the
palate
not
all
that
interesting
or
complex
for
a
big
beer
glad
this
comes
in
12oz
versus
22oz
bottles
too
bad
its
in
sixpacks
drinkability
well
its
good
for
one
or
two
but
i
wouldnt
want
to
drink
them
all
night
still
a
a
good
drinkability
though
considering
its
9
83
abv
d
again
this
beer
is
unashamedly
big
and
it
would
be
difficult
to
drink
too
many
of
these
a
very
surprising
unique
and
very
enjoyable
beer
from
lagunitas
drinkability
sits
a
little
heavy
and
is
a
bit
too
hot
for
too
much
of
it
and
the
sweetness
from
the
matls
gets
a
litlte
rough
on
the
tummy
but
overall
its
a
really
good
beer
and
ill
gladly
have
another
at
another
time
overall
i
will
say
its
a
strong
offering
from
what
ive
seen
as
of
now
to
be
a
pretty
legit
brewery
in
their
offerings
i
almost
put
off
the
review
because
i
was
savoring
the
beer
outright
with
this
one
because
its
a
familiar
yet
distinct
flavor
of
its
own
would
i
buy
more
of
it
yep
already
have
plans
to
pick
up
some
more
for
when
the
real
cold
hits
overall
a
decent
beer
maybe
for
dessert
a
bit
too
sweet
to
have
more
than
one
drinkability
way
too
sweet
almost
a
dessert
beer
hops
allow
it
to
balance
somewhat
but
overall
too
sweet
for
my
taste
pours
a
beautiful
clear
dark
reddish
amber
with
a
yellowishtan
finebubbled
head
aroma
is
hoppy
and
has
a
citrus
undertone
mouthfilling
hoppy
flavor
has
a
firm
hint
of
citrus
mainly
lemon
and
orange
and
is
not
too
bitter
texture
is
rough
lively
and
fizzy
o
awesome
beer
there
is
almost
no
hint
of
the
alcohol
content
need
to
try
the
oaked
version
only
complaint
is
that
the
aroma
doesnt
shine
as
much
as
the
taste
does
all
in
all
an
okay
beer
d
great
and
definitely
a
one
of
a
kind
beer
its
not
as
good
as
hop
stoopid
or
their
pale

its
in
good
company
with
all
their
others
nice

tiny

i
love
this
beer
already
and
havent
even
tasted
it
more
caramel
malt
in
the
taste
big
time
malt
backbone
and
somehow
this
beer
almost
balances
the
huge
malt
profile
with
just
as
much
of
a
hop
kick
mucho
caramel
tangerine
from
the
hops
light
almond

and
even

this

another

this

drink
had
2
of
these
while
watching
football
on
sunday
the
first
one
i
thought
was
kinda
sweet
although
had
a
ton
of
flavor
great
color
and
mouth
feel
i
took
a
brake
and
had
an

and
then
went
back
for

one
still
the

game
wasnt
on
anyway
after
the
ipa
the
shugga
took
on
a
whole

flavor
great
caramel
flavor
with
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
more
hoppy
than
i
remembered
a
well
balanced
brew
one
of
those
brews
that
one
just
wont
do
justice
i
thought
this
stuff
was
seven
percent
when
i
had
it
last
i
think
ten
percent
is
a
bit
high
for
this
sweet
style
of
beer
but
lagunitas
pulls
it
off
making
this
very
easy
to
drink
and
not
a
chore
the
sweetness
while
big
is
settled
nicely
by
a
nice
west
coast
hop
blasting
i
drank
it
much
faster
than
i
thought
i
would
d
easily
able
to
consume
a
12oz
bottle
and
i
wouldnt
have
an
issue
putting
down
a
22oz
bomber
or
even
2
or
3
12oz
bottles
i
can
see
this
going
pretty
good
with
the
upcoming
thanksgiving
dinner
d
i
blasted
through
a
12oz
bottle
of
this
nectar
the
massively
sweet
character
of
this
beer
is
exceptionally
balanced
by
hops
and
the
nearly
10
abv
is
really
wellhidden
this
is
one
of
my
new
favorites
from
lagunitas
they
say
this
was
a
barley
wine
gone
wrong
and
so
a
ton
of
brown
sugar
was
added
to
the
recipe
i
get
hints
of
the
barleywine
characteristics
but
not
much
of
the
brown
sugar
this
beer
confuses
me
drinkabilityive
been
fairly
impressed
with
most
lagunitas
brews
ive
found
the
way
the
hops
are
delivered
through
them
are
right
up
my
alley
id
probably
have
another
one
of
these
down
the
road
pleasantly
suprised
with
this
one
considering
i
was
expecting
some
overly
sweetened
novelty
brown
sugar
loaded
brew
id
definitely
like
to
enjoy
a
bomber
of
this
thing
some
time
again
notes
sweet
copper
ale
with
some
great
hop
flavor
poured
into
a
pint
glass
dark
amber
with
a
nice
one
and
a
half
off
white
head
great
lacing
all
the
way
down
the
glass
the
nose
on
this
is
very
strong
of
malted
barley
almost
compareable
to
a
barley
wine
in
scent
theres
also
a
floral
hop
scent
mixed
in
with
it
the
taste
is
very
malt
intensive
theres
just
a
slight
hint
of
hops
at
first
but
it
quickly
changes
to
a
very
brown
sugar
and
carmel
wallop
the
mouthfeel
is
good
no
noticable
alcohol
burn
for
a
9
8er
the
sugary
overload
of
this
beer
really
does
make
its
drinkability
a
little
hard
to
take
sweet
malt
background
drinkability
one
a
day
would
do
the
trick
for
a
happy
hop
head
that
also
loves
sweet
malt
less
alcohol
would
make
me
go
back
to
this
beer
more
often
edit
not
sure
what
happened
here
but
after
the
first
beer
of
this
i
have
not
liked
the
beer
since
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
more
balanced
then
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
this
isnt
a
beer
i
would
like
to
put
much
age
on
the
best
part
of
the
beer
is
the
balance
and
i
think
with
the
fresh
hops
this
beer
really
shines
without
the
hop
balance
this
one
would
be
sweet
mess
this
sixer
is
fresh
and
tremendously
good
im
glad
i
have
5
oopss
4
more
left
this
is
a
great
holiday
beer
thanks
lagunitas
mouth
is
medium
bodied
with
a
touch
too
much
carbonation
dry
finish
and
a
cloying
nature
of
this
beer
just
leaves
the
flavor
in
you
mouth
creates
a
distinct
warming
behind
your
ears
drinks
fairly
easy
but
i
couldnt
slam
more
than
a
few
would
be
great
around
a
fireplace
or
out
on
a
cold
night
d
a
sipper
for
sure
it
is
a
regular
staple
in
my
fridge
door
when
i
can
get
it
my
first
time
trying
this
fine
ale
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
in
a
tulip
shaped
fest
beer
glass
appears
amber
copper
color
very
appealing
a
slow
pour
resulted
in
little
head
retained
floral
hoppy
smell
certainly
sweet
aroma
prune
like
dark
candied
fruit
molasses
fig
like
brown
sugary
flavor
are
a
few
flavors
i
could
spot
some
fresh
hoppy
flavor
does
exist
mouthfeel
is
certainly
lighter
than
i
had
imagined
making
this
a
pretty
drinkable
ale
in
my
thinking
drinkability
very
flavorful
and
a
well
masked
high
abv
this
one
is
very
sessionable
for
10
bucks
a
six
pack
d
this
stuff
is
good
and
for
being
9
5
its
way
too
easy
to
drink
most
strong
ales
dont
get
me
excited
but
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
worth
getting
to
try
mmmm
first
are
the
dark
fruits
and
the
rich
sweet
malt
which
underlies
all
the
other
flavors
very
nicely
the
hops
and
citrus
come
in
second
with
a
bitter
edge
that
mixes
well
with
the
sweetness
towards
the
end
of
the
profile
is
a
second
helping
of
a
sugar
cookie
like
malt
with
the
heat
from
the
alcohol
only
a
little
masked
this
being
said
the
booze
character
brings
no
heat
just
warmth
mouth
feel
is
think
and
delicious
a
great
beer
thats
opened
my
eyes
to
the
strong
ale
poured
a
hazy
brown
with
a
tiny
head
that
rapidly
faded
to
a
skin
the
aroma
was
citrus
the
taste
was
malty
sweet
with
little
citrus
hop
backbone
however
and
i
have
rarely
never
described
taste
this
way
shugga
tasted
flat
and
heavy
the
feel
was
full
bodied
with
little
carbonation
drinkability
was
good
it
still
wasnt
bad
but
the
heavyflat
sensation
did
affect
my
opinion
of
the
flavor
this
beer
sits
heavy
but
the
mouth
feel
certainly
is
not
thats
thanks
to
a
heavy
carbonation
but
not
noticeably
so
its
necessary
to
sift
through
this
brew
warms
the
throat
and
leaves
an
aftertaste
of
everything
on
the
front
of
the
tongue
d
a
very
aggressive
brew
that
makes
no
attempt
to
hide
its
9
5
abv
a
serious
sipper
elegant
and
sophisticated
a
wonderful
offering
from
the
folks
at
lagunitas
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
to
sit
back
and
relax
with
after
a
long
hard
day
love
it
i
really
dont
want
this
glass
to
ever
end
pretty
good
but
i
expected
something
a
bit
better
poured
a
hazy
reddish
orange
with
a
frothy
foamy
white
head
small
amount
of
sticking
aromas
of
fruity
esters
melted
brown
sugar
a
light
caramel
and
a
mild
pine
resiny
moderate
carbonation
and
a
softly
crisp
creamy
smooth
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
pleasant
tasting
brown
sugar
and
caramel
a
sour
citric
fruity
a
herbal
hoppiness
a
light
alcohol
flavor
shows
up
towards
the
end
and
a
sour
citric
oily
and
malty
finish
with
a
slight
warming
alcohol
taste
lingering
in
the
palate
brown
malts
boozy
creamy
body
with
a
good
dose
of
grassy
bitterness
from
the
hops
not
the
best
strong
brown
ale
ive
come
across
but
it
works
crisp
wellcarbonated
mediumthick
body
that
lays
a
heavy
blow
of
booze
to
the
stomach
a
little
too
dry
on
the
finish
for
all
those
hops
but
this
is
still
a
tasty
beer
and
im
glad
i
have
another
5
brown
shuggas
to
go
around
d
this
one
really
delivers
and
is
certainly
one
of
lagunitas
best
great
sipper
i
am
going
to
be
honest
with
myself
and
all
of
you
reading
this
if
it
were
not
for
an
inner
battle
of
self
control
this
sixer
would
have
been
gone
in
a
night
far
too
easy
drinking
and
massively
enjoyable
while
this
may
not
be
on
any
best
beer
list
it
is
certainly
a
favorite
this
one
has
the
typical
lagunitas
hop
profile
but
the
additional
sweetness
of
the
malts
and
sugar
seem
to
do
wonders
for
this
one
very
good
stuff
mouth
feel
is
bold
body
is
fairly
thick
and
the
beer
is
very
smooth
with
the
slightest
amount
of
carbonation
d
this
beer
is
under
control
nothing
extreme
but
everything
just
right
i
really
enjoyed
it
went
down
very
easy
for
almost
10
you
dont
even
notice
the
alcohol
even
with
the
sweetness
of
the
malt
and
the
overll
sweet
nature
the
hops
balance
this
perfectly
great
beer
drinkability
a
solid
beer
as
lagunitas
always
does
one
of
the
most
consistant
breweries
out
there
at
forst
i
was
liek
wow
but
as
it
went
on
the
sweetness
bothered
me
in
short
it
makes
arrogant
bastard
look
like
liquified
dog
sht
buy
it
on
sight
d
well
it
becomes
a
bit
much
after
awhile
but
up
to
that
point
its
pretty
drinkable
no
problem
finishing
a
bottle
silky
mouth
with
low
levels
of
carbonation
this
was
a
slow
end
of
night
type
of
beer
glad
i
had
a
chance
to
try
it
you
can
read
this
beer
by
its
cover
pours
deep
brown
caramel
color
with
a
lot
of
stuff
going
on
inside
disappointingly
thin
head
not
a
whole
lot
of
lacing
going
on
aroma
lets
you
know
what
youre
in
for
a
whole
lot
of
sweetness
once
you
adjust
this
one
is
really
delicious
if
you
have
a
sweet
tooth
feels
good
in
the
mouth
but
not
a
beer
id
buy
for
a
length
session
mid
to
full
body
not
a
great
deal
of
carbonation
not
a
bad
beer
hard
for
me
to
drink
to
many
due
to
the
sweetness
and
the
alcohol
but
this
is
good
going
down
drinkability
it
was
a
pretty
good
beer
definitely
a
winter
beer
will
drink
it
again
most
likely
in
winter
d
i
just
found
myself
enjoying
hairy
eyeball
much
more
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
but
when
the
brewery
offers
a
much
better
product
in
the
same
category
for
the
same
price
shrug

thanks
richard
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
this
is
an
ok
winter
sipper
but
there
are
numerous
beers
of
the
style
that
i
would
drink
first
it
was
recently
cloned
on
jamils
show
which
got
me
interested
agian
but
it
is
really
too
sticky
a
beer
to
drink
too
often
aggressive
head
on
the
pour
settles
into
a
two
finger
cream
white
mix
of
mostly
tiny
bubbles
pleasant
thin
lacing
very
slow
to
dissolve
down
to
the
liquid
surface
curiously
penetrating
nose
although
most
of
the
components
are
sweet
in
nature
it
drives
up
into
your
nostrils
scents
of
molasses
crisp
toffee
caramelized
brown
sugar
white
grape
cherry
and
pear
fruit
cushion
the
nose
however
theres
a
formidable
burst
of
grapefruit
citrus
hay
and
grass
as
well
not
a
sugar
bomb
but
any
stretch
in
the
mouth
its
mediumbodied
with
carbonation
which
fits
the
whole
more
bitter
or
astringent
feel
here
without
being
offputting
the
butterscotch
honey
molasses
coating
mostly
during
the
first
few
seconds
before
tangerine
white
grapefruit
and
sourdough
bread
show
up
some
banana
alongside
the
grape
pear
apricot
cherry
fruit
not
that
fruity
overall
gets
smokier
and
more
of
a
roasted
chocolate
dust
edge
near
the
finish
one
of
this
beers
more
intriguing
aspects
is
the
interplay
between
the
innate
sweetness
and
the
other
elements
swallow
and
i
accidentally
dumped
a
glass
of
this
in
my
dresser
drawer
thereby
turning
it
into
a
brown
shugga
sea
with
little
sock
and
underwear
islands
im
hoping
it
comes
out
d
very
good
beer
and
dangerously
easy
to
drink
that
9
5
hit
me
sooner
than
i
thought
would
happily
have
it
again
and
hope
to
have
it
again
soon
d
immensely
enjoyable
im
interested
to
see
what
sort
of
a
hop
profile
this
beer
has
when
its
fresh
but
as
it
is
its
still
very
flavorful
and
complex
the
alcohol
is
fairly
conspicuous
on
the
palate
and
yet
its
still
very
easy
to
drink
had
a
bottle
that
was
sitting
in
the
cellar
for
about
6
months
i
was
actually
surprised
by
how
much
i
liked
this
beer
i
reminded
me
more
of
an
old
ale
or
barleywine
for
the
rich
malt
and
biting
hops
but
its
all
good
this
beer
was
tasty
the
flavor
has
a
mix
of
tart
cherry
caramel
toffee
and
raisins
all
with
a
hint
of
molasses
the
medium
body
was
a
little
more
drinkable
than
your
average
10
american
beer
and
i
wouldnt
mind
having
another
certainly
one
of
my
favorite
lagunitas
beers
feel
is
heavy
but
not
slick
very
enjoyable
before
bed
but
could
not
have
many
more
this
is
a
have
one
and
move
on
type
not
to
say
i
wont
buy
again
overall
the
mouth
feel
is
heavy
and
slightly
carbonated
the
body
of
the
beer
is
thick
and
the
finish
lingers
for
a
few
moments
this
beer
will
sneak
up
on
you
and
kick
you
in
the
butt
the
alcohol
flavor
is
there
but
not
dominating
the
beer
has
a
great
flavor
and
is
easy
to
drink
when
i
drink
strong
ale
beers
i
expect
the
beer
to
have
a
well
rounded
flavor
and
is
not
overly
alcoholy
good
job
this
the
first
beer
from
lagunitas
and
i
like
was
i
am
tasting
mouthfeel
is
crisp
but
a
tad
spritzy
flavor
is
of
sweet
molasses
brown
sugar
tart
apples
and
finishes
bitter
a
dull
bitter
this
one
is
reminds
me
of
a
barleywine
for
sure
drinkability
is
low
because
this
is
just
too
sweet
and
too
weird
this
is
a
strange
strong
ale
glad
i
tried
it
but
i
wont
be
back
anytime
soon
12
ounce
bottle
served
at
the
flat
rock
saloon
and
poured
into
a
standard
shaker
glass
appears
a
hazed
amber
brown
color
akin
to
pale
dry
ginger
ale
with
two
fingers
of
dense
ecru
foam
smells
and
tastes
of
molasses
caramelized
malts
brown
sugar
of
course
a
touch
of
hoppy
bitterness
this
ale
is
without
a
doubt
rather
sweet
but
for
some
reason
it
works
really
well
here
every
flavor
plays
off
of
each
other
nicely
falls
somewhere
between
medium
and
full
bodied
with
ample
carbonation
a
different
twist
on
a
strong
ale
thats
certainly
worth
a
try
despite
my
personal
concerns
over
the
bodymouthfeel
of
this
brew
its
deliciously
drinkable
damned
if
i
can
find
the
9abv
in
here
btw
very
balanced
and
smooth
and
easy
drinking
lagunitas
please
send
me
more
since
i
cant
buy
your
products
in
my
state
this
is
my
first
beer
from
lagunitas
it
was
very
interesting
ill
be
looking
for
more
the
mouthfeel
is
the
only
major
flaw
in
this
brew
it
is
really
thin
and
not
so
good
d
very
nice
not
one
that
you
can
drink
a
ton
of
but
something
that
i
will
definitely
look
for
again
my
favorite
offering
to
date
from
lagunitas
and
one
ill
seek
out
again
extremely
drinkable
despite
the
hefty
9
9
abv
and
quite
desireable
as
well
its
a
sipper
no
doubt
but
a
very
pleasurable
one
any
essence
of
brown
sugar
is
obviously
hiding
in
with
the
malt
underneath
the
hops
but
it
takes
away
from
nothing
quite
superb
a
real
tasty
beverage
i
have
been
less
than
impressed
with
lagunitas
previous
to
this
beer
but
this
one
gives
me
some
respect
for
them
and
makes
me
want
more
of
their
beer
and
that
certainly
includes
this
example
a
keeper
overall
this
beer
is
a
solid
example
of
a
big
american
strong
alebarleywine
one
every
once
in
a
while
when
i
need
a
break
from
ipas
in
fine
for
me
d
far
to
drinkable
i
will
look
for
it
again
and
should
like
to
have
it
on
tap
american
strong
ale
hmmm
im
not
sure
about
that
id
say
it
drinks
like
a
barleywine
and
a
well
balanced
and
tasty
one
at
that
if
im
not
drinking
beer
i
am
partial
to
knob
creek
manhattans
and
boy
this
bowled
me
over
on
the
first
sip
boozy
a
bit
but
it
really
hides
the
abv
a
very
nice
surprise
from
a
brewery
that
is
good
at
giving
pleasant
ones
lagunitas
brown
shugga
is
a

malty
somewhat
medicinal
aroma
it
is
medium
bodied
smooth
and
syrupy
with
a
sticky
finish
its
sweet
on
the
lips
and
then
becomes
pretty
bitter
there
is
a
wood
resin
flavor
present
the
finish
is
long
and
boozy
i
think
i
expected
something
sweeter
and
more

this
is

initial

are

caramel
brown
sugar
with
hints
of
fruits
such
as
plums
and
vanilla
as
it
warms
the
true
flavors
come
out
more
of
a
hop
bite
adds
to
the
sweet
finish
and
really
aids
the
balance
nicely
overall
this
is
a
unique
ale
that
i
enjoyed
i
would
recommend
it
and
i
probably
have
it
again
d
i
love
this
mistake
it
grows
on
me
the
more
i
drink
it
a
fine
barleywine
it
is
i
know
its
say
strong
ale
up
above
but
since
it
was
an
accidental
brewing
of
their
gnarley
wine
i
would
have
to
think
thats
what
it
is
either
way
seek
this
out
and
enjoy
pours

finally
some
slight
banana

feel

with

tastes
of
hops
up

then
sweet
malt
then
brown
sugar
strong
alcohol
throughout
and
finally
some
slight
fruitbelgian
yeast
flavors
overall
a
really
smooth
brew
that
packs
a
punch
good
palate
and
nice
blend
of
flavors
this
ones
nice
if
youre
looking
for
an
example
of
a
sweeter
beer
thats
not
overbearingly
sweet
and
is
just
a
good
example
of
a
fine
craft
beer
beside
even
though
alcohol
is
near
10
it
doesnt
hit
you
until
afterwards
and
isnt
harsh
in
the
brew
when
it
does
hit
its
more
peaceful
than
anything
d
like
i
said
the
heebiejeebies
a
little
bit
i
hope
i
didnt
get
a
slightly
bad
bottle
but
i
dont
want
more
after
this
quite
the
interesting
brew
and
a
complex
companion
with
the
roasted
turkey
and
various
zesty
cheese
and
bean
options
i
had
throughout
todays
session
goes
great
with
a
sap
boil
but
itd
be
a
fine
pickup
anytime
between
thanksgiving
and
st
patricks
day
very
easy
to
drink
with
this
abv
taste
is
immediately
very
sweet
and
then
a
rich
hop
presence
takes
charge
hops
are
citrus
earthy
and
deep
pretty
good
balance
for
such
powerful
flavors
easy
drinking
in
spite
of
the
alcohol
content
has
an
almost
barleywine
character
on
the
palate
nice
beer
but
not
very
sessionable
due
to
9
5abv
not
something
i
would
drink
alot
of
wow
this
is
a
great
beer
not
what
i
expected
based
on
the
beer
name
and
color
color
is
a
rich
brown
a
lot
more
hops
than
i
expected
i
can
barely
taste
the
alcohol
which
was
shocking
based
on
the
strength
the
beer
is
really
well
balanced
and
keeps
you
guessing
you
look
at
it
and
think
newcastle
you
smell
it
and
the
molasses
and
sugar
are
there
but
there
is
a
hop
aroma
that
you
dont
expect
you
taste
it
and
at
first
it
reconfirms
the
smell
as
the
hops
and
flowers
pervade
but
then
the
finish
is
rounded
off
with
some
nice
malts
and
sweetness
then
the
hops
reappear
again
a
few
seconds
later
beer
is
well
carbonated
and
could
use
a
bit
more
body
a
bit
of
a
schizophrenic
beer
but
one
that
i
would
buy
again
d
large
and
dominant
would
not
hold
up
for
a
night
this
is
a
decent
holiday
beer
for
those
cold
winter
nights
interesting
beer
glad
i
tried
it
this
would
be
a
great
holiday
beer
to
share
with
others
everything
about
this
beer
is
pretty
standard
for
its
style
except
the
particular
sweetness
it
has
pours
out
a
nice
medium
amber
and
stays
that
way
in
the
glass
little
head
on
pour
good
agitating
pour
at
that
and
doesnt
retain
much
but
a
small
ring
around
the
outside
the
cane
sugar
added
gives
it
a
nice
sweetness
that
i
enjoyed
its
not
as
sweet
as
old
foghorn
which
is
good
for
me
definitely
can
drink
more
than
one
without
a
second
thought
i
enjoyed
it
pretty
thoroughly
and
after
three
i
can
feel
the
residual
bitterness
on
the
sides
of
my
tongue
d
i
could
only
imagine
drinking
1
or
2
of
these
but
it
would
be
good
with
a
hearty
meal
d
a
pretty
decent
brew
although
i
dont
know
if
id
really
go
for
more
than
one
within
a
sitting
i
keep
see
picking
it
from
time
to
time
maybe
itd
be
better
on
tap
d
a
superb
offering
from
lagunitas
ultimately
i
couldve
used
a
little
more
complexity
and
coherence
with
the
taste
and
a
little
more
hidden
alcohol
but
overall
this
is
a
unique
and
more
than
worthy
brew
it
gets
a
notch
down
in
drinkability
due
to
the
prominence
of
the
alcohol
in
flavor
and
richness
which
pushes
it
closer
to
a
sipper
and
would
make
it
more
difficult
to
consume
many
this
one
is
best
left
for
a
slow
journey
with
a
nice
read
d
i
wouldnt
drink
a
whole
lot
its
entirely
too
sweet
im
glad
i
revisited
it
though
as
it
is
better
than
i
remember
it
not
a
bad

id

i
would
try

but
its
not

mouthfeel
is
almost
cloying
from
the
sweetness
and
really
is
the
only
category
this
beer
suffers
otherwise
a
very
tasty
beverage
not
one
of
my
favorites
from
lagunitas
it
took
3
weeks
to
kill
the
sixer
bottle
purchased
in
buffalo
and
poured
into
a
snifter
im
presented
with
an
amber
body
and
a
generous
tan
head
which
gradually
faded
to
a
small
film
and
gave
up
some
lace
the
appearance
reminds
me
very
much
of
a
barleywine
the
aroma
is
wonderfully
perfumed
full
of
fruity
malts
caramel
and
citrus
the
flavour
reminds
me
of
a
nice
barleywine
dark
fruit
and
alcohol
but
with
a
sweet
caramelized
brown
sugar
touch
in
other
ways
it
also
reminds
me
of
a
malt
heavy
double
ipa
as
theres
a
decent
citric
bitterness
rounding
things
off
the
body
was
decent
and
carbonation
fairly
restrained
but
i
do
feel
it
would
have
benefited
from
being
a
touch
heavier
and
chewier
when
i
saw
the
name

this
is
the
last
beer
that
i
bought
from
a

i
dont
regret
that
purchase
it
was
a
pleasant
nightcap
for
me
i
could
possibly
handle
a

or
a

but
on
this
night
one
was
plenty
which
is
my

bitterness
lingers
for
a
solid
60
seconds
so
it
is
hard
to
call
this
drinkable
i
think
this
is
still
a
little
young
i
would

to
give
it
612

see

and
nary
a

of
the

mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
very
nice
for
the
style
for
a
slow
start
this
one
came
on
as
the
experience
went
on
worth
a
try
but
mild
some
guys
told
me
about
it
once
this
beer
poured
a
bright
copper
to
amber
color
very
clear
with
a
nice
cream
colored
head
very
dense
for
a
barley
wine
the
aroma
has
the
distinctive
doughy
character
i
find
in
all
the
offerings
from
lagunitas
it
must
be
the
yeast
the
nose
also
has
some
malt
candy
and
figs
from
the
malt
and
a
light
citrusgrapefruit
character
from
the
hops
the
head
settles
nicely
to
a
thick
lace
the
taste
has
a
wonderful
malty
sweetness
more
of
the
figs
and
hard
candy
character
along
with
the
doughy
hints
i
detected
on
the
nose
mild
hop
bite
and
just
a
hint
of
alcohol
warming
denser
mouth
feel
than
i
anticipated
nicely
drinkable
unusual
yet
pleasing
version
of
the
barley

pick
this

see
it
on

wouldnt

up

couldnt
pick
out
a

flavor

could
tell
from
the
overall
sweetness
not
sweet
like
dfh

that
a
decent
amount
of
sugar
was
used
mouthfeel
is
watery
and
light
drinkability
is
smooth
ballanced
and
sweet
what
this
is
a
barleywine
i
was
thinking
more
of
a
amber
and
brown
hybrid
mix
very
tasty
product
and
quite
enjoyable
after
shoveling
out
from
a
blizzard
overall
a
damn
fine
little
barleywine
from
a

i
notice
a

too
very

up
front
reminds
me
of
a
maple
flavored
frosting
brown
sugar
shows
up
big
towards
the
middle
with
just
a
bit
of
dark
fruit
fig
prune
and
some
pears
the
herbal
hops
at
the
finish
round
things
out
some
but
dont
balance
by
any
means
sort
of
thin
bodied
for
the
flavor
not
too
distracting
but
noticable
just
the
same
decent
drinability
i
think
id
prefer
it
in
a
12

bottle
though
not
something
id
drink
regularly
but
a
nice
change

flavors

off
quite

with
a
strong
backing
of
caramels
which
is
followed
by
a

of
vanilla
there
is
also
a
nice
flavor
throughout
of
brown
sugary
sweetness
that
almost
has

aspect
to
it
the
finish
is
totally
west

with
a
strong
mix
of
citrus
and
piney

that
adds
just
enough
bitterness
to
round
things
off
the

to
this
beer
is
completely
fantastic
with
a
great
chewy
creamy

it
overall
this
brew
wasnt
the
most
amazingly
complex

in
your

but
it
was

a
fantastic

just
hits

been
looking

trying

one
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
moderate
head
that
has
excellent
retention
and
leaves
a

of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
was
of
caramel
malts
but
nothing
much
more
i
expected
maybe
some
brown
shugga
the
flavor
is
somewhat
caramellike
alcohol
is
apparent
and
there
is
a
lot
of
sugar
in
the
taste
too
much
sugar
slightly
thin
not
a
bad
beer
but
too
sweet
and
thin
the
beer
poured
a
golden
amber
color
with
one
finger
of
head
that
sticks
around
well
after
the
pour
the
nose
was
sweet
caramel
not
quite
as
deep
as
i
want
fairly
one
dimensional
the
flavor
had
more
hop
than
the
nose
would
tell
the
flavor
was
too
sugary
for
me
the
feel
was
too
thin
for
a
barleywine
i
want
at
least
a
heafty
moderate
feel
on
this
style
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
too
sugary
and
not
thick
enough

a
bit
too
much
on

scale
to
me
i
like
my
barleywines
and
this
was

but
it
feels
like
i
need
to
chase
this
with
some
jolly

and
some

into
a

goblet
golden
reddish
brown
in
color
with
a
big
tan
head
on
top
there
is
a
sweet
caramel
and
molasses
smell
typical
of
a
barley
wine
the
flavor
is
very
potent
with
a
sharp
sweetness
in
the
middle
and
lots
of
tangy
toffee
and
carmel
flavors
throughout
the
beer
for
an
american
barley
wine
it
is
a
bit
under
hopped
in
my
opinion
more
than
anything
else
is
tangy
and
sweet
and
quiet
enjoyable
drinkability
is
pretty
high
had
no
idea
what
to
expect
with
this
one
and
it
really
was
a
pleasant

bang

was

coupled
with
an
overbearing
alcohol
punch
all
other
tastes
were
basically
blotted
out
mouthfeel
was
slimy
and
alcoholic
this
beer
ended
up
in
the
drain
half
way
through
you
shouldnt
have
to
try
this
hard
to
like
a
beer
from
a
12
oz
bottle
it
pours
a
reddishbrown
with
a
fairsized
offwhite
head
that
lingers
the
smell
is
hoppy
with
a
noticeable
hop
smell
that
still
seems
somehow
subdued
having
brewed
with
brown
sugar
the
smell
and
taste
were
familiar
and
welcome
on
top
of
that
are
traces
of
caramel
drinkability
is
scary
for
a
10
beer
lagunitas
is
hit
and
miss
but
this
is
a
hit
yeah
it
has
a
definite
alcohol
flavor
but
theres
a
heckuva
lot
more
sweeter
barleywines
out
there
i
for
one
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
i
wonder
if
the
bottle
is
sweeter
though
will
find
out
in
2
weeks
when
it
hits
the
shelves
in
nyc
very
rich
very
sweet
the
brown
sugar
added
during
the
brewing
permeates
every
aspect
of
this
beer
it
poured
a
color
only
of
what
i
could
describe
as
liquified
brown
sugar
a
foamy
head
formed
and
as
i
drank
a
sticky
lace
was
on
the
glass
the
aroma
was
of
brown
sugar
the
flavor
was
of
brown
sugar
by
the
way
i
like
brown
sugar
i
used
to
sneak
it
out
of
the
bowl
as
a
kid
when
my
mom
would
bake
there
were
other
tones
in
this
beer
the
malt
was
a
nice
backdrop
flavor
to
the
brown
sugar
the
only
negative
was
that
it
was
so
rich
and
the
alcohol
was
pretty
strong
i
am
not
sure
i
could
drink
too
many
of
these
my
palate
would
be
worn
down
super
special
note
always
check
your
boxes
when
a
trade
has
made
its
way
to
your
door

xlperro

but
im
not

that
this

simply
excellent

full
and
flavorful
a
spectacular
beer
would
be
most
pleasant
on
a
cold
and
rainy
day
cellared
for
approximately
nine
months
the
name
brown
shugga
is
not
deceptive
at
all
it
does
a
good
job
of
characterizing
this
brew
this
was
an
experience
i
didnt
drink
a
whole
bottle
but
instead
shared
one
with
about
three
guests
actually
i
had
tried
it
earlier
at
the
pizza
port
strong
ale
festival
in
december
and
rather
enjoyed
it
very
robust
malt
blend
with
a
brown
sugar
taste
that
gives
way
to
a
good
hop
and
malt
balance
this
is
a
great
desert
beer
i
think
you
could
probably
pour
this
over
vanilla
ice
cream
in
a
glass
and
have
an

nose
this
beer
is
awesome
full
malty
approach
to
this
old
ale
taste
great
amount
of
hops
sugary
with
hops
piney
earthy
citric
tones
this
is
a
great
old
ale
very
nice
brew
cant
be
beat
in
my
opinion
i
want
some
of
that
brown
sugga
baby
gives
me
sweet
loving
sweet
sugary
malt
ridden
flavor
makes
me
want
to
have
more
of
this
brew
mouthfeel
medium
bodied
old
ale
from
this
brew
i
know
whats
coming
my
way
complex
flavors
galore
drinkability
wow
how
can
you
do
this
to
common
folk
alot
of
flavor
that
most
people
arent
ready
for
however
hallelejuah
for
this
example
of
a
kick
ass
old
ale
the
hops
are
much
bigger
at
the
nose
then
i
remember
maybe
i
have
a
fresher
bottle
anyway
at
a
dollar
to
two
dollars
cheaper
than
other
abws
of
the
same
class
this
is
a
steal
im
upping
my
appearance
and
smell
by
half
a
point
and
buying
a
case
to
cellar
this
is
a
dark
redbrown
beer
with
a
nice
tan
head
of
foam
the
aromas
are
very
simple
and
light
they
consist
of
heavy
malts
alcohol
light
hops
and
brown
sugar
the
taste
is
sweet
sugary
and
malty
the
hops
are
noticeable
on
the
finish
but
generally
speaking
they
are
light
the
mouthfeel
is
light
for
a
10
beer
and
the
drinkability
is
excellent
for
a
barleywine
source
liquid
solutions
definitly
a
different
beer
hard
to
categorize
other
than
great
add
a
little
cream
to
this
and
it
would
make
a
great
beer
milkshake
medium

medium

brown

yeast
there
are

full
flavored
ale
malty
and
hoppy
brown
sugar
gives
the
beer
somewhat
of
a
belgian
ale
flavor
mouthfeel
is
full
and
round
finish
is
a
little
crisp
aftertaste
slightly
harsh
some
bottle
aging
would
help
this
beer
a
lot
still
a

and
a
very
interesting
idea

thanks
to
gusler
for
the
opportunity
to
experience
a
wonderful
brew

golden
brown

and

sweet
caramelized
malts
brown
sugar
pine
and
a
bit
of
fresh
cut
grass
starts
off
with
sweet
brown
sugar
almost
too
sweet
but
is
quickly
balanced
by
bitter
notes
of
pine
oils
and
raw
hop
flavors
the
fact
that
the
abv
is
9
9
is
quite
a
surprise
as
i
couldnt
detect
any
notes
of
alcohol
however
it
does
explain
the
increased
difficulty
im
having
typing
this
review
ive
been
a
fan
of
all
the
lagunitas
beers
ive
had
to
date
and
this
one
is
no
different
a
nice
choice
for
a
nightcap
that
im
sure
ill
buy
again
it
pours
nice
and
is
a
deep
amber
color
it
is
quite
bitter
with
good
aroma
and
bittering
hops
plus
malty
and
full
bodied
and
the
high
alcohol
level
brings
all
the
flavors
out
there
was
a
sweet
aftertaste
but
is
not
overly
sweet
while
drinking
it
and
it
feels
wonderful
on
the
tongue
wow
jakey
likes
pours
a
crystal
clear
medium
brown
with
amber
highlights
the
head
is
oddly
yellow
not
sunshine
yellow
but
a
dull
creamish
yellow
and
looks
almost
greasy
or
buttery
the
head
forms
nicely
and
sticks
around
long
enough
that
i
cant
complain
even
when
its
mostly
gone
whats
left
manages
to
sheet
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
first
thing
that
came
to
mind
after
the
first
sniff
was
leaves
its
that
smell
when
youre
out
in
the
woods
and
you
pull
leaves
from
a
branch
and
crush
them
the
hoppy
leaf
smell
dominates
the
soft
warm
malts
underneath
the
flavor
is
what
stole
my
heart
though
youve
got
buttery
biscuits
topped
with
caramel
and
toffee
flakes
topped
with
a
dollop
of
cream
sprinkled
with
brown
sugar
and
a
light
drizzling
of
maple
syrup
actually
that
makes
this
thing
sound
sickeningly
sweet
but
its
not
its
just
sweet
enough
that
youd
call
it
sweet
but
no
more
the
slightly
herbal
hops
are
easily
picked
out
but
dont
overpower
or
even
dominate
an
exquisitely
balanced
brew
and
one
that
i
wouldnt
guess
was
over
6
just
by
the
taste
if
youre
lucky
enough
to
find
this
or
any
lagunitas
beer
grab
it
pours
amber
with
just
a
hint
of
cloudiness
the
nose
is
of
very
strong
hops
is
the
most
enjoyable
part
of
this
beer
it
just
smells
good
this
has
a
heavy
mouthfeel
with
a
barley
wine
like
taste
that
is
average
there
is
a
slight
taste
of
the
brown
sugar
used
in
it
too
there
is
also
a
strong
alcohol
flavor
that
shows
up
towards
the
end
of
this
beer
the
flavor
also
finishes
up
too
bitter
slightly
hazy
ruby
hue
topped
by
an
off
white
thick
creamy
well
retained
head
mellow
mint
laced
citrusy
hop
nose
with
a
dominant
note
of
underripe
tangerine
medium
caramel
malt
aroma
with
hints
of
biscuit
and
butter
mellow
impression
of
berryish
fruitiness
rounds
the
aroma
out
baked
biscuit
mild
sweetness
is
perceived
at
first
then
is
ensued
by
a
pronounced
almost
syrupy
well
caramelized
sugar
note
which
persists
throughout
hop
bitterness
provides
meager
contrast
leaving
the
overall
flavor
profile
quite
sweet
hop
flavor
manages
to
eek
in
lending
a
brown
sugar
smothered
grapefruit
impression
mid
palate
a
bit
lightly
bodied
and
a
touch
over
attenuated
yet
residual
sweetness
remains
assertive
finishes
with
a
lingering
suggestion
of
warming
butterscotch
schnapps
brown
shugga
is
quite
an
odd
brew
the
sweetness
is
only
a
hair
shy
of
cloying
and
seemingly
overshadowed
malt
nuances
that
being
said
the
sheer
uniqueness
and
dearth
of
alcohol
character
until
the
finish
warrant
a
try
with
a
greater
hop
presence
this
could
be
a
fine
barleywine
its
quite
tasty
nonetheless
this
would
make
a
delicious
supremely
calorically
dense
vanilla
ice
cream
float
thanks
to
txhops
for
sending
the
bomber
sorry
lagunitas
but
you
are
quickly
losing
merit
with
me
i
found
the
beer
enjoyable
though
not
great
no
particular
aspect
of
its
character
makes
it
stand
out
actually
i
really
like
the
fact
that
i
can
get
a
bomber
of
9
9
beer
for
less
than
3
but
price
aside
this
beer
is
unexceptional
though
by
no
means
bad
the
slight
cidery
taste
and
the
lack
of
distinction
in
malt
flavor
or
in
hoppiness
leaves
this
beer
truly
average
across
the
board
crytsalclear
and
a
rich
copper
in
color
with
a
mountainous
offwhite
head
and
decent
lacing
the
aroma
is
quite
appealing
as
the
brown
sugar
sweetness
blends
almost
imperceptibly
with
a
blend
of
citric
and
lightly
floral
hops
mild
fusel
alcohol
aromas
develop
as
the
beer
warms
the
flavor
begins
malty
with
some
light
fruity
notes
followed
by
an
almost
granular
sugary
flavor
and
some
mild
alcohol
warming
the
finish
is
dominating
by
a
biting
hop
presence
but
one
which
stings
only
for
a
second
and
merges
gracefully
in
to
a
very
wellbalanced
sugary
sweet
and
somewhat
spicy
aftertaste
mediumfull
body
and
rather
like
a
mild
barley
wine
in
character
a
very
wellcrafted
even
if
accidentally
and
drinkable
beer
poured
a
thick
hazy
amber
color
with
very
little
foam
and
had
not

the
smell
was
of
a
citrus
nature
with
a
hoppymalty
aroma
the
taste
was
of
bitter
hops
and
could
not
find
any
trace
of
brown
sugar
at
all
it
was
thick
and
brown
but
the
bitterness
over
powered
the
sweetness
to
me
this
was
not
a
well
balanced
or
complex
beer
the
pour
an
obscure
amber
color
the
head
is
exorbitant
in
size
the
consistency
frothy
with
enormous
sticky
sheets
of
lace
clinging

also
must
say
the

get
another

after
i
add
some
beers
feel
full

not

so
it
brings
out
the

in

a

not

much
though
overall
still
dont
know
that
im
a
huge
fan
of
the
strong
ale
but
this
one
is
definitely
growing
on
me
had
no
expectations
and
was
blown
away
its
a

crisper
than
the
best
scotch

out
there

but
i
love
it
cant

to

it
again
update
got
a
22
ounce
bomber
from
lambrechts
in
stevensville
michigan
for
4
99
still
very
good
probably
about
a
4
00
but
not
as
good
as
on
tap
this
is
the
best
american
strong
ale
i
have
had
yet
wish
i
could
find
it
in
a
6pack
instead
of
on
tap
pours
a
pretty
mahogany
brown
in
color
with
about
a
1finger
foamy
beige
head
a
good
amount
of
sticky
lacing
is
seen
when
sipped
that
sticks
to
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
burnt
brown
sugar
for
the
most
part
the
taste
is
pretty
much
the
same
actually
with
some
roasted
malts
also
with
some
spice
you
really
dont
taste
the
alcohol
in
it
it
will
hit
you
after
awhile
though
goes
down
pretty
easy
but
is
more
of
a
sipper
kind
of
brew
then
say
a
chugging
for
sure
not
really
much
of
a
bitter
or
harsh
aftertaste
or
is
the
brew
talking
mediumbodied
with
perfect
carbonation
you
arent
drinking
more
than
one
of
these
at
a
sitting
at
all
overall
i
liked
it
just
an
ok
beer
nothing
really
special
not
my
cup
of
tea
so
take
my
review
with
a
grain
of
salt
tasted
metallic
and
too
boozy
hairy
eyeball
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
large
lacing
head
there
is
a
sweet
marshmellow
like
aroma
the
taste
is
also
sweet
nice
malty
backbone
with
sweet
dry
fruit
flavors
great
body
great
flavors
overall
a
great
drinkable
complex
beer
im
really
enjoying
the
balance
of
this
and
i
have
to
say
i
think
its
seriously
underrated
overall
this
is
top
notch
for
something
so
high
in
abv
its
exceptionally
easy
to
drink
and
goes
down
a
bit
too
easy
giving
how
strong
it
is
i
bought
bombers
of
this
for
6
a
piece
i
stole
them
lots
of
raisin
and
some
rum
peach
on
the
nose
the
taste
a
little
boozey
on
the
finish
nice
medium
bread
maltiness
to
add
some
warmth
had
one
that
was
a
bit
soy
saucy
it
is
lagunitas
so
i
am
definitely
willing
to
try
it
again
still
not
entirely
sure

o
an

opening
sweetheart
of
a
beer
another
great
and
affordable
treat
from
lagunitas
very
good
beer
im
always
happy
to
buy
bombers
of
most
lagunitas
products
because
of
their
reasonable
pricing
policy
on
those
products
overall
this
is
a
very
solid
strong
aleold
ale
its
not
as
rich
and
complex
as
my
favorites
in
the
style
but
its
very
tasty
nonetheless
i
dont
get
much
alcohol
at
all
as
many
on
here
suggest
im
impressed
and
think
this
is
underrated
and
prefer
it
to
brown
shugga
a
wonderful
american
ale
nonsense
with
the
reviews
of
boozey
nice
subtle

i
like
strong
beers
and
this
draft
beer
was
very
strong
and
i
enjoyed
this
offering
a
lot
the
taste
was
unique
and
the
beer
was
very
smooth
i
really
enjoyed
the

i
will
seek
out
this
offering
and
other
lagunitas
beers
down

and
i
look
forward
to
my
next

lent
by
the
alcohol
and
the

initial
flavor
giving
way
to
a
bitter

that
keeps
the
beer
from
being
cloying

and
pleasant
a
good

for

night
mouthfeel

warming
rich
and
full
but
not
overwhelming
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
strong
ale
it
has
a
wonderfully
rich
and
sweet
aroma
that
is
a
wonderful
mix
of
malt
and
esters
this
carries
over
into
the
flavor
but
is
aided
by
roast
malt
lending
a
richer
deeper
darker
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
a
nice
balance
between
rich
and
full
and
modest
and
drinkable
a
very
fine
ale
all
around
and
well
worth
drinking
overall
a
decent
beer
but
a
little
boozy
for
my
liking
you
can
really
tell
there
is
booze
in
this
thing
given
the
price
its
totally
worth
it
for
the
little
bit
of
boozy
feeling
you
get
from
it
i
think
i
paid
5
for
a
bomber
o
4
50
a
good
brew
this
seems
more
like
a
food
pairing
brew
to
me
than
a
standalone
experience
would
work
wonderfully
with
smoked
and
braised
meats
i
recommend
giving
this
one
a
shot
o
if
you
like
big
fruity
sweet
malty
beers
you
will
enjoy
this
reminds
me
a
lot
of
fresh
old
stock
ale
old
stock
ale
ages
like
a
champ
takes
on
nice
notes
of
toffee
and
vanilla
this
beer
intrigues
me
it
may
do
the
same
malt
malt
and
malt
are
up

with
this
beer
not
bad
will
buy
again
a
good
description
of
this
beer
is

to
find
and
i
didnt
succeed
either

this
beer
being
a

overall
fairly
idiosyncratic

think
is
quite
a
good
brew
if
anything
the
mystery
aspect
adds
points
in
my
books
i
havent
tasted
anything
quite
like
it
its
very
complex
also
it
seems
to
be
a
great
value
got
a
bomber
for
only
4
79
i
dont
visit
the
strong
ale
variety
much
but
this
beer
tastes
fine
from
lagunitas
im
not
too
surprised
not
sure
what
an
outlier
is
or
why
it
was
detected
i
have
to
justify
my
rating
with
a
review
so
heres
the
review
this
beer
rocked
period
1
pint
6
oz
bottle
poured
into
a
snifter
pours
a
deep
amber
that
reflects
almost
red
if
held
to
the
light
head
is
dark
brown
and
small
it
recedes
quickly
with
no
lacing
smell
is
a
bit
muted
but
i
get
bread
caramel
toffee
and
maple
maybe
a
hint
of
vanilla
reminds
me
of
a
old
ale
a
bit
as
it
warms
taste
is
malty
and
toasted
with
some
rich
caramel
and
maple
coming
through
again
some
sweet
dark
fruit
in
there
that
reminds
me
of
raisins
there
are
some
bitter
hops
on
the
end
but
just
enough
to
clean
up
the
sweetness
that
presents
in
the
middle
finish
is
dry
and
slightly
bitter
from
the
hops
mouthfeel
is
rich
and
creamy
and
sticky
but
doesnt
linger
dangerously
sippable
given
a
9
1
abv
overall
it
doesnt
blow
me
away
but
i
cant
come
up
with
any
glaring
flaws
either
other
than
maybe
the
nose
could
be
more
prominent
a
very
nice
american
strong
ale
worth
a
look
taste
reminds
me
a
little
of
a
belgian
ale
malt
up
front
with
some
sweet
fruit
no
booze
in
the
taste
very
smooth
excellent
strong
ale
well
balanced
with
a
sweetness
coming
from
both
malt
and
yeast
potentially
dangerous
poured
out
of
a
bomber
into
a
mug
chilled
was
good
very
good
but
could
have
been
a
little
stronger
in
my
opinion
some
flavors
were
mute
very
good
strong
ale
great
malty
malty
malty
with
a
roasted
finish
smell
and
taste
caramel
copper
in
color
with
a
light
offwhite
head
which
fades
quickly
poured
into
my
teku
glass
lots
of
malt
and
kind
of
sweet
looks
deep
amber
but
not
quite
red
smells
chocolatey
what
the
fuck
some
sweet
malt
not
at
all
what
i
was
expecting
the
taste
is
caramel
some
more
of
that
chocolate
maybe
a
faint
resemblance
of
hops
on
the
aftertaste
nice
creamy
mouthfeel
yum
overall
an
exceptionally
smooth
full
flavored
ale
that
is
deceiving
in
its
strength
great
pick
for
the
coldest
day
of
the
year
smell
is
good
not
a
huge
fan

the

hints
at
the

the
beer
is
big
and
chewy
almost
oily
with
a
moderate
carbonation
there
were
some
interesting
comments
in
other
reviews
no
ageing
this
would
not
make
it
mellow
it
would
get
too
sweet
the
comment
that
it
is
like
a
fully
realized
esb
is
right
on
americanized
as
usual
with
lagunitas
this
is
very
worthwhile
get
it
while
you
can
great
beer
from
lagunitas
strong
sweet
deep
ruddyreddish
brown
and
smoothly
bitter
this
perihelial
release
is
big
and
rich
but
also
only
a
bit
syrupy
and
largely
fairly
restrained
compared
to
a
lot
of
strong
ales
this
actually
pretty
light
certainly
not
buoyant
but
thinner
than
many
and
less
dark
in
its
maltprofile
and
color
somehow
hairy
eyeball
seems
aptbut
im
not
entirely
sure
i
can
articulate
how
mostly
however
its
just
very
drinkable
for
a
bigabv
maltsugary
ale
andwhile
its
definitely
the
stuff
of
chill
wintereve
drinkingit
hits
its
marks
and
does
its
job
cant
say
this
is
one
of
my
favs
from
lagunitas
but
its
not
bad
fruity
but
with
a
strong
flavor
component
thats
heavy
on
the
alcohol
seems
a
bit
lost
and
confused
busy
but
lacking
focus
i
suppose
my
extreme
love
for
hop
stoopid
could
be
affecting
my
opinion
here
as
they
are
very
different
beers
o
another
great
beer
from
lagunitas
i
almost
passed
on
this
one
i
have
to
stop
doubting
these
guys
glass
imperial
pint
the
mouth
is
slick
and
substantial
its
a
pretty
big
beer
that
is
best
to
savor
lagunitas
hairy
eyeball
great
tasting
would
not
hurt
to
buy
and
let
sit
for
a
year
or
two
to
become
very
potent
has
a
brownishredish
hue
nice
head
that
dies
down
pretty
moderately
taste
very
bourbon
like
and
you
can
smell
it
it
taste
more
than
a
9
4
abv
beer
as
stated
above
would
not
let
this
sit
no
more
than
1
or
two
years
actually
a
year
and
half
overall
still
great
would
buy
another
one
overall
i
liked
it
and
prefer
it
over
arrogant
bastard
o
i
have
an
idea
of
what
they
are
aiming
for
but
i
think
they
need
better
integration
the
sweetness
upfront
and
the
bitterness
in
the
back
both
come
on
a
bit
strong
it
makes
for
a
good
but
not
a
great
beer
very
yummy
but
after
two
pints
i
looked
up
the
abv
and
decided
to
stop
as
i
was
the
driver
had
a
great
time
dancing
and
no
hangover
just
a
big
ol
fruitcake
rich
with
big
notes
of
ripe
figs
burned
banana
peels
and
malts
beautiful
ruby
colored
with
a
not
big
but
thick
and
creamy
head
o
im
so
used
to
drinking
lagunitass
hop
forward
beers
that
something
like
this
catches
me
by
surprise
nice
complex
flavors
and
aromas
beautiful
amberred
color
fruity
nose
hoppy
and
sweet
a
cross
between
an
ipa
and
a
stout
quite
an
experience

it

pretty
good

nice
abv
of
9
4
good
flavor
to
it
there
are
not
many
beers
that
i
dont
like
from
lagunitas
this
comes
across
as
a
hoppy
barleywine
to
me
drinking
like
an
english
ale
interesting
departure
from
the
typical
lagunitas
offerings
another
great
beer
from
a
top
notch
brewery
malt
forward
but
has
hops
and
drinkable
as
fuck
lagunitas
never
rips
you
off
on
price
for
high
grav
brews
overall
excellent
and
under
4
for
a
bomber
this
has
a
lot
of
flavor
and
the
alcohol
is
fairly
well
hidden
nice
sipper
tastes
and
smells
like
alcohol
with
a
slight
malt
backbone
overall
this
is
what
i
think
of
for
a
winter
ale
the
flavors
are
perfect
bold
complex
and
balanced
such
an
excellent
and
potent
example
of
the
style
i
highly
recommend
that
you
get
a
few
bottles
of
this
and
share
with
family
and
friends
during
the
holidays
perfection
two
thumbs
way
up
thank
you

just
solidifies

a
highly
enjoyable
offering
this
one
is
growing
on
me
at
first
try
i
didnt
like
it
too
sweet
ive
had
it
a
few
times
now
and
its
got
a
great
malt
profile
and
has
plenty
of
hop
to
break
up
the
malt
flavor
im
a
fan
poured
from
a
22
oz
bottle
into
a
stemless
wine
glass
sweet
malty
and
slightly
bitter
hop
beer
a
cross
between
a
scotch
ale
and
winter
warmer
if
i
were
to
categorize
aroma
is
full
of
caramel
malt
and
floral
hops
with
booze
and
hints
of
citrus
toasted
nutty
notes
pale
in
comparison
to
the
sweetness
fruity
specialty
malt
and
dark
notes
of
raisin
and
fig
are
reminiscent
of
brandy
flavor
reveals
a
fairly
sweet
caramel
malt
backbone
which
begins
with
contrasting
vinous
notes
and
finishes
exceedingly
bitter
as
it
warms
notes
of
chocolate
and
lightly
roasted
malt
add
complexity
along
with
nutmeg
and
ginger
in
the
aftertaste
very
interesting
brew
but
lacks
a
bit
in
depth
of
malt
character
yeast
and
malt
jump
out
in
the
nose
of
this
the
2014
edition
of
hairy
eyeball
that
yeastiness
follows
through
with
a
slight
bit
of
hops
riding
backseat
not
much
head
but
as
it
fades
into
a
partly
cloudy
condition
with
faint
lacing
on
the
side
it
will
linger
and
give
you
pretty
formations
to
grok
over
amber
to
red
appearance
with
a
sort
of
plum
to
dark
cherry
nearly
currant
kind
of
fruitiness
that
perks
up
as
your
mouth
gets
over
the
alcohol
burn
and
residing
mid
level
bitterness
long
for
pucker
that
does
not
really
recede
this
is
a
sipper
of
a
beer
that
would
probably
handle
getting
some
barrel
treatment
eerily
well
and
turn
that
9
x
abv
up
a
notch
and
fill
in
with
staves
of
goodness
this
would
probably
cellar
like
a
beast
as
well
and
give
you
a
really
nice
barleywine
towards
the
first
cold
snap
of
2015
i
do
not
like
dark
beers
and
i
know
this
isnt
even
that
dark
so
this
was
a
bit
different
for
me
very
flavorful
very
malty
i
probably
wont
get
it
again
but
i
wouldnt
be
unhappy
if
it
was
served
to
me
o
a
powerfultasting
strong
ale
with
barleywinelike
fruitiness
very
good
winter
warmer
this
is
a
good
winter
warmer
not
the
best
but
for
a
22
oz
bottle
itll
surely
get
the
job
done
it
has
a
good
balance
of
sweetness
and
bitterness
its
almost
like
a
cross
between
a
dunkel
and
a
bitter
ipa
my
pour
produced
a
brief
finger
of
lighttan
head
that
quickly
fell
to
wisps
nose
was
kind
of
boozy
with
a
strong
dried
dark
fruitiness
like
prunes
raisins
and
dates
color
was
a
copperybrown
srm
17
22
with
nequality
clarity
mouthfeel
was
medium
the
first
thing
that
i
noticed
after
taking
a
sip
was
the
intense
fusel
alcohol
heat
the
second
thing
was
the
extreme
fruitiness
and
maltiness
that
came
right
behind
it
reminiscent
of
a
holiday
fruitcake
finish
was
warm
not
outright
hot
and
incredibly
fruity
overall
very
maltforward
for
lagunitas
there
is
some
complexity
and
with
a
full
body
this
beer
is
quite
drinkable
a
great
beer
for
the
maltheads
out
there
served
from
20
or
so
oz
bottle
into
large
beer
glass
which
was
frozen
pours
a
great
head
medium
lacing
appearance
is
very
dark
the
darker
the
better
the
first
sip
packs
a
wallop
strong
alcohol
content
paired
with
a
rich
creamy
taste
that
keeps
you
sipping
there
is
a
subtle
hoppy
background
delicious
to
the
last
bubbly
drop
so
far
this
is
my
favorite
beer
of
the
few
ive
had
i
would
drink
it
over
and
over
again
very
well
done
from
lagunitas
overall
i
would
highly
recommend
this
brew
to
anyone
who
enjoys
the
darker
variety
deep
garnett
in
color
with
good
clarity
poured
with
a
short
dense
offwhite
foam
that
quickly
dissipated
sweet
malt
brown
sugar
raisin
and
fig
aromas
with
boozy
notes
in
the
background
full
bodied
with
tangy
assertive
carbonation
through
the
middle
and
a
semidry
finish
sweet
bready
malt
dark
fruit
fig
and
raisin
flavors
up
front
tangy
lightly
spicy
hop
bitterness
through
the
middle
definitive
booziness
toward
the
end
as
well
finished
with
a
semidry
feel
and
lingering
bready
malt
and
herbal
hop
bitterness
this
was
excellent
and
to
me
drank
a
lot
like
an
ale
version
of
a
doppelbock
enjoy
dark
beer
i
have
to
wait
til
next
year
to
buy
some
more
classic
winter
beer
o
average
for
the
style
no
flaws
but
not
particularly
memorable
price
point
4
9922
oz
bottle
pours
a
coppery
brown
with
2f
cream
head
nice
lacing
all
the
way
down
smells
strongly
of
caramel
malt
with
some
esters
and
a
tease
of
vanilla
more
sweet
malt
with
very
mild
piney
hops
followed
by
medicinal
tones
and
a
very
sweet
finish
some
late
tobacco
and
vanilla
aftertaste
more
syrupy
feeling
than
i
typically
enjoy
but
the
correction
for
that
would
turn
the
medicinal
tones
astringent
its
no
arrogant
bastard
but
very
good
nonetheless
overall
the
flavors
dont
integrate
particularly
well
and
the
finish
is
a
bit
too
sweet
not
a
bad
beer
but
below
the
top
echelon
for
the
style
overall
great
beer
from
a
lagunitas
d
this
is
a
very
good
beer
a
malt
bomb
that
leaves
me
wanted
more
surprisingly
quaffable
i
cant
say
a
single
bad
thing
about
the
beer
itself
also
a
bargain
given
the
sub
6bomber
price
tag
my
only
minor
complaint
is
that
this
one
comes
in
bombers
its
a
lot
a
beer
for
one
person
i
would
certainly
buy
a
lot
more
if
this
were
available
in
12oz
bottles
awfully
good
beer
for
the
price
right
here
under
5
bucks
a
bottle
this
strong
impressive
from
the
brewery
who
always
frustrates
me
with
the
same
yeast
profile
its
not
so
evident
in
this
one
more
of
a
belgian
or
a
high
gravity
ale
yeast
profile
clean
and
highly
attenuated
stuff
not
the
usual
from
these
guys
on
the
yeast
front
finally
not
as
dark
as
expected
in
color
looks
like
an
english
nut
brown
smallish
head
too
is
short
lived
the
nose
is
caramel
heavy
with
some
cherry
and
banana
yeast
notes
as
well
as
some
medium
roast
cocoa
and
a
little
residual
sugar
the
flavor
is
beautifully
rich
a
nice
juxtaposition
to
its
appearance
with
heavy
burnt
or
burning
sugar
flavors
and
a
vanilla
candy
finish
great
bubbles
and
i
can
still
taste
the
grain
which
makes
this
for
me
confused
on
the
yeast
front
which
is
better
than
the
typical
lagunitas
safe
realm
but
its
undecided
shockingly
strong
i
would
have
guessed
7
abv
before
i
saw
the
label
not
sure
how
they
can
keep
putting
out
beer
this
good
for
such
a
fair
price
but
the
more
of
these
bombers
the
better
great
stuff
really
mahogany
brown
color
with
a
trace
of
beige
head
brussels
lacing
good
clarity
lush
dark
malt
flavor
with
a
very
smooth
and
bone
dry
body
this
starts
off
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
and
is
quickly
put
in
check
by
the
faint
bittering
hops
this
the
most
reserved
bit
of
hopping
by
lagunitas
aroma
of
sweet
dark
malt
is
a
bit
reserved
o
a
nice
strong
ale
solid
and
enjoyable
overall
really
good
beer
and
a
good
value
as
well
taste
is
robust
and
definitely
packs
an
alcohol
wallop
theres
even
a
slight
burn
mouthfeel
is
nicely
carbonated
and
light
despite
the
heavy
alcohol
lots
of
sweet
malt
some
grapefruit
hops
and
tons
of
juicy
citrus
and
tropical
fruit
poured
from
a
brown
22
oz
bottle
has
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
1
inch
head
smell
is
mild
a
bit
of
malts
taste
is
alcohol
malts
some
sweetness
boozy
a
touch
if
breadiness
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
isnt
bad
but
a
bit
disappointing
overall
malty
sweet
bread
and
toffee
taste
and
aroma
that
balances
with
an
appropriate
bitterness
good
version
of
strong
ale
and
price
point
was
good
a
bit
boozy
will
have
again
again
a
high
quality
beer
nothing
to
sniff
at
and
for
the
price
at
the
top
of
its
range
bravo
o
this
is
a
fine
example
of
a
strong
ale
sweets
balanced
with
bitterness
very
complex
ale
thats
a
pleasure
to
drink
go
get
ya
one
you
wont
be
disappointed
o
lagunitas
always
does
a
stellar
job
with
any
style
they
tackle
i
like
this
alot
overall
a
solid
if
unremarkable
strong
ale
from
lagunitas
enjoyable
a
great
darker
but
not
too
dark
ale
with
a
very
clean
taste
and
notes
of
chocolate
and
cloves
in
the
aftertaste
fresh
but
with
some
profound
depth
to
the
midtaste
this
beer
is
clearly
crafted
to
be
enjoyed
by
beer
connoisseur
would
drink
this
anytime
cheers
the
beer
pours
a
deep
rich
mahogany
with
hints
of
rich
amber
ruby
and
brown
the
beers
with
a
head
of
medium
sized
offwhitenearlyyellow
bubbles
that
sit
a
healthy
fingers
width
above
the
beer
once
they
settle
down
and
leave
a
nice
medium
width
lacing
along
the
sides
of
the
glass
in
body
the
beer
is
nearly
too
dark
to
see
through
but
is
crystal
clear
and
clean
of
any
sediment
or
particles
on
the
nose
the
beer
smells
tamely
of
toffee
and
caramel
malt
there
are
touches
of
biscuits
and
rustic
bread
thrown
in
but
overall
the
nose
is
subtle
sweet
malt
which
is
surprising
given
the
abv
on
the
tongue
the
beer
tastes
sweet
nearly
cloying
with
a
fizzle
of
hot
booze
on
the
edges
dark
fruit
sweetness
is
very
prominent
from
the
malts
and
subtle
acidity
does
work
its
way
into
the
corners
of
the
mouth
but
bitterness
is
subtle
to
noneexistent
in
the
mouth
in
flavor
the
beer
begins
as
rich
toffee
and
bread
malt
working
its
way
towards
oatmeal
bread
then
caramel
sweeter
caramel
and
booze
enter
towards
the
finish
and
carry
a
middlinglength
finish
of
raisin
bread
and
caramel
almost
like
a
bread
pudding
the
aftertaste
is
light
spicy
booze
and
sweet
malt
caramel
a
touch
of
stale
bread
runs
across
the
palate
in
the
mouth
the
beer
feels
on
the
plus
side
of
medium
in
body
with
a
middling
carbonation
that
does
put
a
nice
tickle
on
the
tongue
mouthfeel
is
crisp
slightly
syrupy
and
a
bit
prickly
when
the
beer
leaves
the
mouth
is
left
sticky
with
malt
sweetness
and
a
little
river
of
saliva
in
the
cheeks
overall
this
is
a
nice
simple
strong
alebarleywineold
alewhat
is
the
difference
between
those
styles
really
this
beer
treads
on
the
maltier
side
of
the
tracks
and
carries
a
supreme
drinkability
which
is
dangerous
given
the
abv
it
doesnt
hit
me
over
the
head
with
any
intense
or
decadent
flavors
but
merely
provides
good
flavor
and
warmth
to
the
belly
this
is
a
perfect
sipper
after
dinner
as
it
will
not
weigh
the
belly
down
too
much
a
nice
beer
this
beer
is
sticky
sweet
with
a
great
mouthfeel
heavy
lace
and
overall
great
appearance
and
smell
the
alcohol
content
is
superb
and
compliments
the
overall
experience
the
taste
is
orange
like
but
not
overwhelming
a
nice
strong
ale
nice
job
lagunitas
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
meh
its
an
ok
offering
i
remember
now
why
i
havent
bothered
writing
a
formal
review
when
i
had
it
before
overall
good
beer
lots
of
interesting
characteristics
fruity
but
not
citrus
roasty
but
not
overwhelming
seek
one
out
and
see
for
yourself
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
but
im
not
dissipointed
o
nice
beer
deep
and
rich
but
really
only
one
note
the
abv
doesnt
need
to
be
this
high
for
a
beer
like
this
and
actually
kinda
hurts
it
i
really
like
how
the
color
sets
it
apart
from
other
strong
ales
o
fairly
complex
and
rewarding
a
different
direction
than
the
hop
heavy
yet
delicious
offerings
from
lagunitas
the
bready
aftertaste
and
alcohol
linger
but
are
not
overpowering
9
4abv
give
this
brew
a
try
overall
very
interesting
brew
tasty
very
unique
o
just
okay
this
beer
is
huge
and
not
screwing
around
but
its
just
a
little
too
medicinal
and
syrupy
for
what
it
is
probably
as
a
consequence
of
its
abv
i
probably
will
not
revisit
this
one
22oz
bottle
pours
a
dark
amber
with
good
lacing
the
smell
is
light
coffee
and
sweet
cream
the
taste
is
super
roasty
with
chocolate
and
coffee
notes
followed
by
a
creamy
after
taste
this
beer
feels
smooth
and
hides
the
alcohol
well
overall
i
was
quite
surprised
by
the
flavor
on
this
one
and
i
liked
it
better
than
most
lagunitas
strong
ales
o
another
winner
from
lagunitas
and
at
this
price
its
hard
to
beat
overall
a
very
enjoyable
strong
brown
ale
cant
beat
the
price
point
at
5
99
for
a
22oz
bomber
overall
i
am
ranking
this
based
on
how
this
seems
to
have
aged
as
well
as
what
i
remember
it
tastes
like
fresh
o
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
it
is
a
refreshing
change
of
pace
from
the
hop
monsters
i
have
been
pounding
down
as
of
late
it
reminds
me
a
lot
of
an
englishstyle
barleywine
just
tuned
down
a
notch
overall
an
outstanding
perennial
release
from
lagunitas
that
adds
some
much
needed
variety
to
their
landscape
of
brews
id
buy
it
again
if
they
release
it
next
year
but
once
is
enough
for
now
while
on
the
surface
this
beer
seems
to
be
maltforward
it
has
an
unmistakable
lagunitasstyle
hoppiness
that
all
the
brewerys
beers
seem
to
be
endowed
with
this
is
a
complex
unique
and
delicious
amalgamation
of
hoppiness
and
maltiness
its
like
some
twisted
cross
between
a
belgian
strong
dark
ale
an
american
barleywine
and
a
double
ipa
outstanding
poured
from
a
bomber
into
a
goblet
this
dark
ale
is
a
reddish
brown
color
not
quite
opaque
but
dark
with
ample
tan
head
aroma
is
dominated
by
malty
toffee
notes
with
a
light
fruitiness
like
apples
a
hint
of
chocolate
brownie
and
some
hop
resins
that
serve
to
offset
the
heavy
sweetness
unlike
many
lagunitas
brews
where
the
hops
lead
the
way
this
is
a
dark
malt
bomb
rich
and
quite
sweet
although
the
hops
still
lurk
in
there
to
provide
a
resinous
bitterness
tastes
like
burnt
brown
sugar
raisin
cake
and
toffee
with
these
sweet
baked
flavors
coexisting
with
a
dark
fruit
undercurrent
that
evokes
prunes
and
sourish
cherry
juice
i
also
get
some
herbal
licorice
root
quite
boozy
as
well
some
fusels
to
help
you
remember
that
this
is
a
big
brew
pace
yourself
body
is
unexpectedly
on
the
thin
side
but
the
sugars
and
hop
resins
do
coat
the
mouth
finish
is
long
and
lingering
like
most
lagunitas
brews
with
a
fruity
undercurrent
like
in
the
middle
section
hiding
beneath
burnt
sugar
and
earthy
bitter
hops
gives
me
a
decent
buzz
and
the
low
level
of
carbonation
enhances
this
problem
if
i
am
forced
to
compare
i
prefer
lagunitas
hopcentric
offerings
and
the
alcohol
is
aggressive
but
i
did
sign
up
for
this
and
it
remains
one
of
my
favorite
winter
ales
put
this
shit
in
those
casks
around
st
bernard
dogs
necks
damn
the
spirits
o
the
mouthfeel
really
hurts
this
beer
you
get
a
quick
look
at
the
flavors
but
then
they
are
gone
just
like
that
the
hairy
eyeball
is
a
highly
decadent
ale
that
doesnt
simply
pair
well
with
cake
desserts
it
serves
to
replace
them
altogether
accompaniments
of
stilton
dried
fruit
and
assorted
nuts
would
make
for
the
most
divine
closure
to
any
premium
dinner
overall
i
found
the
beer
to
be
enjoyable
this
beer
kind
of
feels
like
it
doesnt
know
what
it
wants
to
be
wouldnt
purchase
again
o
imperial
brown
ale
maybe
its
a
maltlovers
dream
and
very
well
crafted
a
bomber
of
this
was
a
little
much
for
my
palate
personally
but
i
can
respect
this
brew
overall
i
personally
am
not
a
fan
of
this
one
and
will
not
be
seeking
another
for
some
time
my
first
dissapointment
from
lagunitas
this
ale
pours
a
gorgeous
amber
brown
color
with
a
generous
white
head
that
lasts
throughout
the
pour
the
aroma
is
malty
herbaceous
and
boozy
it
sips
thicker
than
expected
medium
to
full
bodied
definitely
coats
the
mouth
the
flavor
is
very
malty
and
almost
cloyingly
sweet
there
is
an
awful
lot
of
booze
bite
to
this
one
and
little
to
no
hop
presence
at
at
all
to
balance
the
alcohol
and
malt
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
but
not
what
i
have
come
to
expect
from
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
the
is
the
most
overly
malty
ale
i
have
ever
had
and
im
a
fan
of
lagunitas
its
way
off
in
balance
and
ive
tried
it
3
times
thinking
i
got
an
older
bottle
its
under
carbonated
and
just
to
dang
sweet
its
just
not
a
good
beer
for
them
and
others
are
rating
it
because
its
lagunitas
and
not
what
it
should
be
rated
at
sorry
its
just
not
that
good
nice
full
bodied
scotch
like
brew
overall
i
like
the
sweet
taste
of
this
beer
i
just
feel
it
needs
a
bit
more
balance
i
expected
a
fairly
larger
hoppiness
coming
from
lagunitas
and
was
slightly
disappointed
o
the
hops
were
a
little
too
bittertannic
for
my
tastes
but
not
unbearable
the
hops
also
compensated
for
for
the
common
sweetness
found
in
the
style
take
the
good
with
the
bad
not
likely
that
i
will
get
this
again
but
definitely
worth
a
try
d
a
pretty
nice
malt
forward
beer
on
the
cheap
but
not
a
favorite
from
lagunitas
fairly
nice
balance
but
not
all
that
in
depth
would
take
brown
sugga
over
this
any
day
22
ounce
bottle
served
in
a
snifter
the
beer
pours
a
clear
dark
brownruby
red
color
with
an
inch
tan
head
that
sticked
around
a
while
theres
also
a
lot
of
lacing
aroma
is
nice
the
brew
smells
like
caramel
dark
fruit
brown
sugar
nuts
and
molasses
it
tastes
like
dark
fruit
raisins
plums
red
grapes
caramel
nuts
grainy
malt
toffee
molasses
and
some
light
hops
and
booze
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
a
bit
sticky
but
also
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
i
liked
this
brew
but
then
ive
liked
most
if
not
all
of
the
lagunitas
beers
ive
had
5
99
a
bomber
overall
a
good
beer
that
is
nice
to
have
once
a
year
as
its
very
complicated
even
though
its
malt
dominant
the
malt
version
of
a
dipa
that
allows
the
malt
bill
to
bring
out
different
flavors
and
hide
the
abv
this
is
the
second
bomber
i
drank
this
winter
and
both
times
i
pretty
much
got
wrecked
from
the
bomber
as
the
booze
sneaks
up
on
you
which
is
nice
o
why
does
it
seem
like
everything
lagunitas
does
that
isnt
hopforward
is
just
ok
you
could
almost
call
them
a
one
trick
pony
but
i
wont
cuz
theyre
still
awesome
this
beer
drinks
easy
enough
but
is
just
lacking
character
i
could
drink
this
a
lot
not
for
every
day
drinking
but
perfect
taking
some
nice
sips
while
enjoying
whatever
you
enjoy
very
interesting
strong
ale
and
certainly
worth
the
price
just
not
the
best
from
the
folks
in
chico
overall
this
beer
falls
short
it
is
a
little
too
sweet
and
has
a
funky
aroma
and
not
in
a
good
way
i
think
ill
pass
next
time
overall
pretty
good
strong
ale
a
real
banger
itll
do
very
good
give
it
a
go
overall
a
very
solid
malt
driven
brew
good
toasty
and
bready
malt
taste
with
some
nice
dark
fruit
undertones
a
lot
like
a
doppelbock
overall
some
may
find
the
flavour
to
be
a
bit
cloying
but
for
me
i
think
it
is
a
well
balanced
sweetness
an
enjoyable
american
strong
ale
sipper
b
overall
definitely
a
good
but
not
quite
great
brew
the
initial
metallic
taste
was
kind
of
odd
and
unexpected
but
luckily
does
little
to
detract
from
an
otherwise
good
beer
definitely
a
sipper
given
its
alcohol
content
maybe
something
worth
sharing
on
a
winter
day
seems
a
lot
like
a
barleywine
to
me
o
you
definitely
feel
the
9
4
abv
an
enjoyable
beer
and
i
look
forward
to
having
another
sometime
soon
its
dark
brown
with
no
real
head
or
lacing
its
basically
crystal
clear
seems
flat
but
the
look
of
it
theres
a
nice
bubblegum
scent
there
its
smokey
with
a
sweet
candy
taste
true
to
the
scent
its
a
strong
fullbodied
ale
bold
alcohol
a
bit
too
bold
quite
frankly
but
a
real
nice
drink
o
surprisingly
unhoppy
for
lagunitas
tasty
if
in
a
malty
mood
easier
to
drink
than
a
few
other
examples
of
the
style
arrogant
bastard
comes
to
mind
and
well
worth
the
purchase
if
you
want
to
go
beyond
the
usual
cycle
of
ipadipaipa
like
myself
get
this
try
this
really
good
offering
overall
a
good
price
and
one
that
would
be
interesting
to
age
a
bit
forward
now
but
has
qualities
that
would
add
some
layers
of
complexity
overall
a
very
good
example
of
an
american
strong
ale
if
you
see
this
you
are
fortunate
and
should
buy
it
if
you
dont
like
high
alcohol
beers
i
would
stay
away
from
it
because
the
alcohol
warming
is
the
biggest
piece
of
this
beer
otherwise
it
is
a
good
one
to
have
one
top
of
that
it
taught
me
a
new
word
perihelial
because
the
label
says
it
is
the
perihelial
release
look
it
up
a
departure
from
what
i
expect
from
both
lagunitas
and
american
strong
ales
not
necessarily
bad
but
surely
different
but
its
cheap
enough
that
i
might
grab
another
bottle
to
age
and
possibly
enjoy
in
a
year
or
two
as
the
english
barleywine
i
think
it
wants
to
be
the
alcohol
is
obvious
but
only
strong
support
as
it
licks
the
roof
of
the
mouth
reminding
you
eh
strong
o
ahh
with
this
one
i
dont
really
know
i
love
it
one
moment
and
dislike
it
the
next
the
first
sip
when
cold
was
bad
way
too
sweet
however
it
did
smooth
out
when
it
warmed
just
seemed
like
too
much
of
everything
malt
hops
coffee
rye
toffee
booze
that
it
all
conflicted
with
the
others
i
wouldnt
say
it
was
bad
but
i
wouldnt
say
it
was
great
just
a
middling
brew
no
knock
on
lagunitas
here
i
dig
a
lot
of
their
brews
but
this
one
isnt
my
fave
this
may
be
pretty
interesting
with
a
year
maybe
two
on
it
what
a
great
beer
and
just
like
all
lagunitas
gems
very
reasonably
priced
at
3
99
for
a
bomber
this
is
amazing
and
will
buy
again
you
should
too
the
appearance
is
a
deep
red
amber
with
a
two
finger
head
but
the
appearance
is
probably
the
best
part
of
the
beer
there
isnt
much
aroma
at
all
the
taste
is
largely
a
malty
sweetness
of
caramel
and
bit
of
berry
fruit
taste
there
is
a
slight
hop
presence
but
the
malt
definitely
is
the
main
part
of
this
beer
overall
this
beer
is
good
but
this
runs
on
the
sweeter
side
and
needs
something
to
balance
it
out
worth
giving
a
try
considering
its
only
5
bucks
76100
o
a
great
winter
ale
giving
all
the
spice
and
christmas
crap
a
miss
mouthfeel
was
decent
for
a
strong
ale
i
couldnt
detect
too
much
alcohol
in
a
good
way
the
creaminess
of
this
beer
was
great
but
the
lack
of
wanting
another
sip
knocked
this
down
a
notch
overall
one
of
the
more
complex
offerings
from
lagunitas
very
tasty
i
dont
know
what
everyone
else
is
drinking
but
this
one
is
outstanding
beautiful
color
big
malty
aroma
followed
by
big
malty
taste
apples
and
pears
not
very
hoppy
thats
ok
and
i
wonder
if
the
lack
of
overbearing
hops
influences
the
lower
scores
a
bit
perfect
for
this
time
of
year
great
mouthfeel
easy
drinking
yet
packs
one
helluva
punch
delicious
o
im
not
at
all
impressed
with
this
beer
lagunitas
says
this
a
beer
youd
reach
for
on
a
hungover
morning
id
imagine
so
if
one
wanted
to
evacuate
anything
consumer
from
the
night
before
not
a
great
candidate
for
a
strong
ale
seriously
whats
with
all
of
the
hype
with
this
brewery
taste
is
met
in
the
first
sip
by
a
sharp
bite
of
alcohol
it
doesnt
achieve
medicinal
or
fusel
but
its
sharp
then
you
notice
a
syrupy
sweetness
subsequently
it
smooths
out
a
bit
the
taste
is
dark
caramel
brown
sugar
syrup
it
could
a
have
a
nutty
presence
but
is
shy
and
a
spice
character
thats
heavy
the
drink
is
slow
and
sluggish
and
it
does
not
travel
the
palate
well
the
carbonation
is
not
enough
to
lighten
the
sticky
syrupy
body
the
finish
is
a
slightly
bitter
a
hodepodge
of
spice
and
sweet
fruit
and
a
reminder
of
that
alcohol
and
some
warmth
astringent
int
he
finish
and
a
bit
flat
overall
it
lacks
luster
and
courage
its
unctiousand
a
bit
cloying
i
think
this
is
just
ok
o
mild
and
subtle
all
around
decent
flavors
but
nothing
memorable
or
complex
o
its
a
little
too
bitter
for
my
taste
but
its
a
good
winter
beer
im
into
the
dark
fruit
id
get
it
again
not
a
favorite
from
lagunitas
but
its
alright
and
the
price
points
are
usually
a
great
aspect
o
im
grading
this
as
it
tasted
cold
the
warmer
it
got
the
less
i
liked
it
the
booze
just
became
too
prominent
as
it
warmed
this
beer
is
pretty
complex
with
tons
of
different
flavors
going
on
the
abv
is
never
really
hidden
but
the
flavors
are
good
enough
to
distract
you
for
a
while
i
cant
say
ill
ever
have
it
again
but
i
recognize
quality
when
i
taste
it
reading
the
other
reviews
of
the
past
i
wonder
if
the
recipe
has
changed
regardless
there
are
not
many
beers
which
are
so
totally
toxic
they
do
not
deserve
a
decent
rating
lets
call
it
a
winter
warmer
although
its
still
72
degrees
out
at
5pm
here
on
socal
served
out
of
a
22
oz
bottle
on
a
cold
foggy
night
in
boise
i
thought
the
9
4
alc
would
warm
up
the
evening
and
it
did
dark
amber
with
red
highlights
medium
head
firm
but
collapsed
quickly
dark
roasted
malts
linger
on
the
palette
alcohol
whispers
through
the
hint
of
fruit
the
near
sweetness
of
barleywine
but
not
quite
do
i
taste
oak
close
it
muses
with
the
barrel
but
never
delivers
on
glass
down
the
frozen
fog
outside
does
not
seem
quite
as
cold
a
very
good
winter
tale
cheers
nice
story
on
the
bottles
side
panel
would
have
again
worth
trying
especially
if
christmas
beers
et
al
are
your
thing
like
the
aroma
the
taste
begins
with
a
full
barley
malt
character
almost
akin
to
a
barleywine
with
a
subtle
sweetness
balancing
off
the
the
boozy
finish
hops
linger
at
the
end
but
so
does
a
molasseslike
sweetness
interesting
but
i
wonder
how
it
would
be
after
it
cellared
for
a
few
months
o
a
good
winter
beer
i
wouldnt
rush
out
for
more
but
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
if
offered
to
me
either
better
at
cellar
temp
than
refrigerator
temp
a
tough
one
for
me
grade
it
was
certainly
tasty
but
nothing
particularly
shined
for
me
with
this
one
overall
this
is
a
very
unique
strong
ale
with
all
the
malty
sweetness
it
leans
more
towards
the
barleywine
end
of
things
but
its
tasty
and
very
drinkable
for
9
a
great
winter
beer
o
its
sort
of
an
american
version
of
an
old
ale
with
a
prominent
malt
presence
but
a
firm
hops
bitterness
o
i
say
this
beer
is
an
enhanced
brown
ale
the
alcohol
is
present
and
the
body
is
slightly
cloying
o
sort
of
an
odd
beer
like
a
stoutamerican
barleywine
hybrid
mouthfeel
is
a
little
flat
thinnish
not
very
sticky
a
little
oily
or
slick
overall
its
certainly
not
bad
but
its
not
exciting
this
is
a
very
malty
beer
sweet
not
much
in
the
hops
department
if
i
was
given
this
blind
i
would
say
it
was
a
onenote
take
on
an
abbey
dubbel
it
is
a
pretty
beer
garnet
color
with
thick
offwhite
head
but
that
is
easily
the
strongest
aspect
of
the
beer
unfortunately
appearance
is
also
the
least
important
aspect
of
beer
enjoyment
rare
failure
from
lagunitas
pours
a
clear
copper
with
a
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
partial
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
caramel
slight
fruit
and
alcohol
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
strong
malt
and
slight
caramel
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
toasty
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
with
a
strong
emphasis
on
the
malt
aspect
all
around
overall
i
thought
this
was
outstanding
for
a
strong
ale
at
this
price
and
with
this
level
of
availability
i
mean
i
didnt
even
have
to
go
to
bevmo
for
this
it
was
at
the
local
ralphs
grocery
store
o
the
first
time
i
had
this
i
was
not
a
fan
but
it
is
pretty
good
seems
like
a
wee
heavy
of
sorts
with
the
huge
malt
flavors
pour
slow
because
the
head
foams
up
fast
easy
sipping
brew
with
not
much
of
an
after
taste
the
bottle
goes
down
very
easy
with
some
delicious
caramel
notes
overall
a
great
buy
that
i
would
drink
again
poured
into
a
13
oz
tulip
glass
pours
a
brownish
amber
with
a
one
inch
off
white
head
that
leaves
behind
lots
of
lace
smell
is
very
powerful
rum
soaked
raisins
alcohol
burnt
brown
sugar
toffee
and
turpentine
taste
is
all
of
that
but
better
than
the
nose
would
have
you
expect
balanced
nice
body
is
medium
large
nice
carbonation
a
touch
dry
and
a
bit
of
a
sipper
this
is
solid
i
would
say
taste
like
a
old
ale
to
me
but
that
is
subjective
but
at
roughly
5bomber
it
packs
a
nice
punch
and
the
booze
is
pretty
well
hidden
present
only
at
the
finish
where
it
coupled
with
the
hops
coats
the
palate
in
a
cool
oily
slickness
o
this
is
great
beer
especially
for
the
holiday
season
and
the
high
abv
pairs
nicely
with
the
snow
were
getting
in
new
england
overall
very
good
beer
should
be
reclassified
as
an
imperial
winter
ale
has
slight
spiciness
properties
feel
like
your
drinking
a
mellow
gingerbread
cookie
so
if
youre
thinking
what
im
thinking
you
would
best
pair
this
gem
with
your
favorite
dessert
lagunitas
the
hairy
eyeball
ale
45
o
a
decent
beer
but
doesnt
really
do
anything
to
identify
itself
as
anything
special
i
really
liked
this
beer
would
love
it
get
my
hands
on
some
more
o
ok
not
great
worth
a
shot
but
i
will
not
be
reaching
for
this
one
in
the
near
future
odecent
sipping
strong
ale
a
little
unbalanced
but
nevertheless
reasonably
enjoyable
drank
at
room
temp
bigtime
alcohol
presence
really
no
smell
whatsoever
no
hop
presence
lots
of
malt
malt
and
warm
alcohol
that
burns
your
tongue
a
little
smoky
taste
to
make
me
think
of
a
cross
between
an
imperial
stout
and
a
doppelbock
and
a
wee
heavy
i
will
be
drinking
the
hell
out
of
this
beer
every
christmas
overly
bitter
and
one
note
overall
i
wasnt
impressed
with
this
was
really
hoping
for
it
to
be
better
drinkable
but
average
pours
a
brilliant
reddish
brown
color
with
a
decent
sized
creamy
off
white
head
that
shows
moderate
retention
and
a
fair
amount
of
lace
an
almost
artificial
smelling
fruity
nose
with
lots
of
grape
cherry
and
tangerine
brown
sugar
caramel
and
hints
of
yeast
esters
play
supporting
roles
little
to
no
hop
aroma
the
flavor
is
quite
complex
actually
sweet
and
sugary
up
front
mixed
with
grape
dimetapp
and
a
hint
of
wet
cardboard
a
hint
of
earthy
hop
flavor
mixed
with
a
bit
of
alcohol
comes
through
next
as
do
some
quad
like
yeasty
flavors
lingering
dark
sugar
drizzled
cherries
long
after
each
sip
medium
to
thick
body
with
a
light
to
moderate
level
of
carbonation
and
a
sweet
almost
syrupy
mouthfeel
odd
brew
for
sure
it
took
me
a
bit
to
figure
it
out
and
it
was
somewhat
drinkable
probably
wouldnt
seek
out
again
but
glad
to
try
it
color
is
pretty
much
beer
bottle
brown
quite
strong
at
9
4
abv
this
beer
is
malty
with
hints
of
cooked
brown
sugar
and
molasses
yet
the
sweetness
is
quite
well
reserved
lots
of
dark
fruit
and
fig
like
flavors
give
this
beer
quite
a
bite
overall
it
has
a
strong
roasty
flavor
and
smell
this
is
a
good
cold
weather
beer
due
the
high
abv
and
the
dark
autumn
like
flavors
poured
out
of
a
22
into
a
pint
glass
this
is
a
big
dark
malty
beast
should
have
expected
as
much
from
lagunitass
winter
ale
a
bit
syrupy
little
to
no
head
dark
brown
color
very
nice
toasty
caramel
malt
smell
creamy
mouthfeel
but
a
little
too
much
umamisoy
sauce
for
my
liking
in
the
aftertaste
the
taste
is
very
fruitybiting
though
reminds
me
of
ninkasi
total
domination
ipa
that
way
with
the
combo
of
a
little
grapefruitlike
tang
and
dark
umami
malt
overall
a
good
brew
but
not
really
my
favorite
style
t
fruits
sweet
malts
and
bitter
herbal
hops
blend
well
together
with
notes
of
grape
juice
apple
juice
tobacco
caramel
chocolate
its
like
an
ipa
and
stout
in
one
beer
as
the
beer
warms
it
feels
like
a
light
imperial
stout
o
potent
and
complex
a
very
smooth
sipper
with
a
great
flavor
definitely
enjoyable
would
drink
again
quite
drinkable
well
balanced
and
complex
o
this
is
a
damn
good
beer
at
3
70
a
bomber
after
tax
this
is
a
great
deal
i
can
see
my
self
buying
this
as
long
as
i
can
find
it
i
recommend
this
to
everyone
who
is
a
fan
of
the
style
o
a
tasty
beer
with
a
lot
of
complexity
on
the
nose
and
palate
the
alcohol
burn
is
there
so
id
like
to
stash
a
bottle
or
tow
of
this
and
allow
the
booze
to
settle
and
the
other
flavors
to
come
to
the
forefront
still
i
loved
this
beer
overall
officially
an
american
strong
ale
by
categorization
though
id
be
partial
to
calling
it
an
imperial
brown
based
on
flavor
alone
similar
to
its
sister
brew
brown
shugga
though
not
as
sweet
or
abrasive
all
in
all
for
9
it
comes
across
as
a
damn
approachable
drinkable
brew
will
buy
again
overall
an
interesting
experiment
with
this
beer
at
this
point
the
barley
has
no
doubt
become
the
strong
accent
and
drinks
a
lot
like
a
barleywine
i
would
love
to
try
a
fresh
bottle
of
this
and
see
how
the
traditional
lagunitas
hop
presence
being
more
active
would
change
this
brew
the
taste
is
great
lots
of
malt
layers
with
subtle
toast
and
an
almost
bready
yeast
underneath
the
slight
fruitiness
with
a
hint
of
dark
sugar
and
a
mild
pepperlike
taste
up
front
which
is
a
bit
of
alcohol
taste
yet
there
is
a
mild
pine
flavor
which
i
am
guessing
is
hop
derived
the
bitterness
level
seems
to
present
itself
more
as
it
warms
with
a
nice
chewy
malt
flavor
and
slight
dark
caramel
taste
coming
in
later
the
alcohol
is
very
mild
in
the
taste
i
only
noticed
it
halfway
into
the
bomber
but
it
enhances
the
flavor
i
am
sure
since
there
is
a
fresh
raisinlike
element
that
adds
to
the
light
roasted
malt
flavors
i
would
drink
this
again
for
sure
since
the
value
for
such
a
quality
beer
at
a
great
price
is
usually
a
nobrainer
i
consider
this
one
of
the
better
strong
brown
ales
i
have
had
recently
do
this
beer
follows
the
blueprint
for
a
very
ordinary
american
strong
ale
but
does
so
effectively
it
exhibits
some
semblance
of
balance
with
hops
and
malt
each
evident
to
some
degree
that
said
it
is
the
malt
influence
that
is
most
appealing
and
memorable
overall
a
nice
easy
drinking
brew
at
9
abv
it
was
creamy
and
smooth
with
all
the
flavors
working
in
concert
with
one
another
to
create
a
very
nice
flavor
profile
smells
mostly
of
dark
fruits
and
brown
sugar
some
molasses
aroma
as
well
tastes
of
all
of
these
things
but
also
has
a
stronger
raisinspice
element
with
a
medium
texture
and
a
hint
of
stickiness
pours
a
dark
red
brown
amber
with
a
light
tan
head
that
dissipated
to
a
thin
film
aroma
of
bready
malt
dark
fruit
sweet
lots
of
flavor
malt
light
and
dark
fruits
vanilla
but
but
somewhat
subdued
almost
like
a
lightly
flavored
barley
wine
subtle
but
complex
quite
different
the
thick
creamy
body
and
pleasant
overall
taste
are
excellent
a
second
bottle
had
more
assertive
flavors
a
great
american
strong
ale
for
a
strong
ale
this
is
a
massively
sweet
creamy
beer
loads
of
caramel
toffee
and
other
sticky
sweets
come
through
on
the
nose
and
tongue
its
slightly
boozy
but
not
bad
for
a
9
there
is
a
slight
hop
bitterness
there
although
i
imagine
with
time
a
bottle
of
this
would
turn
out
similar
to
their
olde
gnarlywine
another
solid
entry
from
this
brewery
pours
a
very
dark
brown
almost
like
root
beer
thin
offwhite
head
settles
to
a
nice
ring
and
swirls
of
haze
big
maltforward
aromas
of
brown
sugar
caramel
toffee
booze
and
some
residual
hop
bitterness
something
like
a
cross
between
a
barleywine
and
a
big
brown
ale
taste
is
similarly
maltheavy
with
more
sweet
toffee
brown
sugar
and
caramel
some
roasted
nuts
baked
brown
bread
and
some
slightly
grassy
hops
very
signature
of
a
lagunitas
brew
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
sticky
with
a
mediumfull
body
and
low
carbonation
overall
a
solid
stab
at
a
maltier
beer
from
lagunitas
while
i
enjoyed
it
i
doubt
id
pass
up
a
little
sumpin
sumpin
for
it
o
pretty
tasty
beer
that
i
remember
being
much
hoppier
when
fresh
a
year
has
turned
this
into
a
barleywineold
ale
of
sorts
i
might
go
back
and
pick
up
some
more
bottles
to
see
if
the
alcohol
will
fade
with
some
more
age
clear
dark
rusty
color
dense
khaki
head
that
holds
nicely
smells
malty
and
very
boozy
its
an
older
bottle
it
was
the
last
one
at
the
store
and
quite
dusty
i
think
it
tastes
so
much
better
than
is
smells
really
smooth
and
creamy
for
a
9er
yeast
flavor
it
similar
to
other
langunitas
beers
floral
and
fruity
tastes
like
american
hops
citrusy
and
pungent
lots
of
caramel
and
grainy
base
flavor
pretty
unique
like
old
ales
ive
had
but
american
in
character
m
the
eyeball
has
one
of
the
best
feels
ive
ever
experienced
i
wish
every
beer
had
such
an
interesting
and
balanced
mf
thick
and
coating
and
creamy
and
warm
yet
highly
drinkable
with
a
perfect
amount
of
muted
carbonation
overall
the
best
thing
about
this
brew
was
the
unique
fruitiness
especially
for
the
style
the
malt
profile
was
also
interesting
as
it
started
lighter
and
paler
and
moved
to
an
almost
stouty
mouth
a
negative
however
was
how
overly
boozy
the
finish
seemed
if
not
for
the
nice
balance
from
the
rest
of
the
flavoring
it
would
have
made
this
one
a
bit
hard
to
handle
notes
this
has
quite
the
malty
backbone
a
dam
good
cold
weather
beer
cheers
something
about
this
beer
simply
failed
to
connect
for
me
moderately
turbid
chestnut
with
offtan
head
up
front
a
big
dose
of
malty
sweetness
that
was
reasonably
well
restrained
hops
followed
in
a
feeble
attempt
to
breach
the
malt
and
then
fell
back
after
an
initial
rebuff
malt
rebounded
and
carried
through
the
finish
with
a
bit
of
a
watery
aspect
there
was
a
consistent
metallic
note
throughout
overall
the
effect
was
that
of
a
barleywine
that
needed
to
spend
some
time
in
the
gym
if
you
imagine
beer
styles
on
a
spectrum
this
would
be
somewhere
between
winter
warmer
and
barleywine
this
is
a
malty
ale
toffee
raisins
some
wintery
spices
cloves
nutmeg
ginger
and
a
hop
presence
that
feels
almost
a
dipa
oily
medium
mouthfeel
this
is
a
good
brew
fresh
but
ive
sat
on
a
6
pack
for
almost
a
year
and
feel
like
the
malts
really
took
over
and
put
the
hops
in
their
place
very
intriguing
but
a
real
stew
of
flavors
a
bargain
if
you
want
a
six
pack
of
strong
beers
around
for
medicinal
purposes
o
pretty
easy
drinking
for
style
and
abv
nothing
amazing
about
it
but
solid
very
smooth
and
creamy
this
is
an
outstanding
beer
and
the
best
ive
had
from
lagunitas
picked
this
up
to
finish
off
a
mixed
6
pack
and
thought
it
was
a
good
beer
according
to
the
bartender
they
intentionally
age
several
of
these
kegs
for
months
to
see
how
they
develop
this
particular
keg
was
aged
for
nine
months
proper
gestation
sounds
to
me
it
pours
a
deep
rubybrown
topped
by
over
a
finger
of
creamtan
foam
the
nose
comprises
light
raisins
light
figs
wheat
and
mild
biscuits
its
all
kinda
weak
and
nondescript
to
my
strils
the
taste
holds
notes
of
figs
light
roasted
malts
raisins
dark
wheat
brown
sugar
cinnamon
toasted
biscuits
very
light
wood
light
orange
rind
and
very
light
bitter
coffee
damn
is
the
stuff
all
over
the
place
in
a
good
way
the
body
is
a
straight
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
fairly
dryish
finish
overall
a
very
solid
brew
one
that
clearly
blossoms
with
age
a
cellar
temperature
bottle
is
poured
into
a
pint
glass
a
large
tan
foamy
head
looks
really
good
it
rests
atop
a
dark
ruby
colored
liquid
with
plenty
of
rising
carbonation
i
can
smell
caramel
malts
as
i
pour
the
beer
getting
up
close
and
personal
i
can
smell
brown
sugar
alcohol
and
some
mildly
oily
hops
it
smells
good
i
can
taste
why
this
is
a
strong
ale
both
the
hops
and
malts
are
big
and
bold
brown
sugar
caramel
plum
are
all
present
bitter
hops
come
in
as
i
swallow
and
linger
on
along
with
some
alcohol
there
is
a
bit
of
burn
as
i
swallow
and
some
stickiness
throughout
but
it
is
still
a
good
mouthfeel
i
like
this
beer
its
a
pretty
good
strong
ale
i
would
certainly
pick
up
another
bottle
if
i
come
across
one
this
one
poured
out
as
a
reddish
brown
colored
ale
the
head
was
white
and
foamy
looking
and
leaving
just
a
touch
of
lacing
behind
on
the
glass
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
a
little
sweet
and
a
little
fruity
its
got
a
little
bit
of
everything
going
on
in
there
the
taste
is
kind
of
the
same
way
in
my
opinion
im
not
sure
exactly
what
theyre
going
for
here
but
its
interesting
the
mouthfeel
was
drinkable
decent
carbonation
and
nicely
balanced
overall
id
like
to
have
this
one
again
one
day
just
to
give
it
another
shot
perhaps
id
enjoy
it
even
more
the
second
time
around
good
beer
a
couple
months
ago
slightly
fresher
i
remember
enjoying
it
more
but
its
still
good
now
overall
i
dont
understand
the
hype
for
this
beer
its
quite
difficult
to
drink
and
the
flavors
just
dont
work
for
my
pallet
at
all
beers
over
8
are
very
hit
or
miss
for
me
a
few
as
and
a
several
ds
and
even
an
f
this
one
is
a
big
d
only
because
it
looks
and
smells
ok
i
will
not
be
able
to
finish
this
one
overall
she
works
out
alright
but
doesnt
taste
too
much
different
compared
to
some
of
their
other
strong
offerings
glad
i
had
it
though
the
deep
amber
hints
of
then
delivers
a
rich
toasted
malt
sweetness
with
lots
of
caramel
and
toffee
flavor
then
follows
that
sweet
dark
fruitiness
with
a
hint
of
dryness
to
round
out
the
body
of
this
brew
not
much
burn
but
watch
out
for
the
alcohol
one
12
oz
bottle
is
usually
enough
for
me
overall
this
is
an
excellent
beer
and
fascinating
in
both
taste
and
texture
the
only
real
fault
is
that
the
8
83
abv
does
result
in
an
vodkalike
bite
which
can
prove
distracting
especially
late
in
the
aftertaste
however
the
rest
of
the
beer
quite
makes
up
for
this
good
stuff
certainly
would
buy
again
o
great
beer
drinkable
recommended
and
supertasty
will
have
again
the
more
lagunitas
i
try
the
more
i
like
it
o
this
makes
for
easy
drinking
a
dangerous
combination
with
abv
as
it
is
id
have
another
one
but
the
following
day
two
of
these
might
put
me
under
have
always
been
a
fan
of
this
beer
but
on
cask
it
truly
is
sensational
lots
of
booze
here
both
in
taste
and
in
the
warming
sensation
which
did
detract
a
bit
from
everything
in
this
beer
this
would
have
been
better
to
have
during
cooler
months
since
its
somewhat
overpowering
but
the
flavors
work
well
together
and
the
slightly
toasted
mouthfeel
ties
everything
in
together
well
aaa
o
solid
not
a
beer
a
will
order
every
time
at
lagunitas
but
every
now
and
then
it
is
very
enjoyable
especially
if
it
is
cool
outside
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
deep
dark
vibrant
and
clear
bloodruby
coloring
that
almost
looks
brown
in
dim
light
the
brew
starts
off
with
a
thin
half
inch
yet
solid
and
dense
head
that
is
biege
in
color
and
this
slowly
settles
out
into
a
film
that
is
barely
coating
the
top
aromas
remind
me
of
a
barleywine
delicious
and
rich
there
is
a
darkly
sweet
molasses
backbone
to
the
smell
with
fruits
blended
throughout
such
as
cherry
and
plum
some
very
slight
spicing
and
hops
are
noted
deep
into
the
aroma
as
well
flavors
are
rich
but
on
a
slick
and
lightly
oily
body
the
flavors
have
a
bit
of
coffee
in
the
background
as
well
as
bittering
hops
both
of
which
balance
out
the
heavy
caramel
sweetness
and
dark
fruit
characteristics
the
aftertaste
is
rich
in
the
caramel
sweet
and
slightly
cloying
making
the
finish
slightly
bittersweet
and
rich
as
well
there
is
a
slight
linger
to
the
finish
but
the
flavors
keep
this
from
being
overly
unpleasant
decent
brew
od
overall
a
good
american
strong
ale
but
one
will
do
me
for
the
night
this
one
was
enjoyable
for
me
because
i
am
fan
for
more
bitter
brews
i
would
recommend
trying
this
out
m
heavy
bodied
slightly
syrupy
but
not
overly
sticky
pours
a
tepid
darkbrown
a
light
tan
head
sticks
very
well
smell
is
cocoa
powder
and
sorta
airy
and
cool
herbal
notes
on
the
taste
maybe
some
anise
mostly
dark
malts
and
booze
high
resins
and
tannins
nutty
finishes
minerally
bitter
and
hot
i
had
no
idea
what
to
expect
but
this
was
a
complex
decent
brew
definitely
worth
a
try
m
heavy
bodied
with
some
carbonation
although
this
seems
to
almost
get
lost
in
the
body
and
flavor
slightly
syrupy
a
good
tasting
beer
that
is
not
as
threating
as
it
may
look
easy
drinking
opinion
overall
this
is
a
pretty
decent
beer
this
is
different
than
my
recollection
of
this
beer
as
i
remember
it
being
much
more
hoppy
than
it
is
and
having
a
rather
harsh
mix
between
the
hops
dark
malts
and
water
in
the
finish
this
beer
is
much
different
and
is
much
more
palatable
this
beer
is
a
little
on
the
mild
side
for
the
style
as
far
as
palate
sensations
go
for
this
style
but
overall
it
is
clean
and
well
presented
i
would
drink
this
beer
again
and
more
importantly
i
am
not
sad
about
my
mistake
of
buying
the
wrong
sixpack
overall
this
beers
9
00
abv
is
well
hidden
in
a
myriad
complex
flavors
that
will
lull
you
into
bliss
revel
d
this
is
possibly
one
of
my
favorite
malty
beers
i
am
quite
enamored
with
it
overall
a
good
strong
ale
the
flavor
and
mouthfeel
were
good
but
the
lack
of
aroma
was
disappointing
o
a
good
strong
ale
deeper
flavors
would
have
been
nice
but
this
is
a
solid
brew
do
nothing
really
stands
out
with
this
one
for
me
unfortunately
could
be
my
least
favorite
lagunitas
to
date
a
half
dozen
or
so
would
recommend
something
else
in
the
style
thanks
for
the
beer
ptmcb
a
big
big
beer
a
little
too
cloying
for
my
tastes
but
acknowledged
to
be
well
done
for
a
beer
aiming
to
be
a
hairy
eyeball
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
good
american
strong
ale
it
kind
of
reminds
me
of
a
cross
between
and
american
barleywine
and
a
dopplebock
it
had
ok
balance
but
i
felt
like
a
little
more
floral
hops
would
help
this
brew
out
a
little
i
always
felt
like
all
in
all
lagunitas
is
pretty
generous
with
the
hops
but
this
one
was
for
sure
all
about
the
malts
some
may
call
it
a
malt
bomb
as
with
most
of
lagunitas
high
gravity
beers
the
alcohol
was
evident
but
still
nicely
subdued
which
makes
for
good
drinkability
but
the
sweetness
of
this
brew
would
prevent
me
from
having
more
then
two
i
could
see
picking
this
up
when
i
am
in
the
mood
for
a
really
malty
beer
and
for
the
price
it
is
a
pretty
good
deal
like
all
of
the
other
beers
i
have
had
from
them
if
malt
forward
beers
are
you
thing
then
this
brew
wont
disappointed
this
was
another
good
beer
from
lagunitas
if
they
make
a
bad
beer
then
i
havent
found
it
yet
odalthough
i
do
not
detect
any
cherries
this
beer
reminds
me
of
those
chocolatedipped
cherries
that
have
a
liqueursyrup
filling
its
as
if
they
took
a
slice
of
pineapple
a
handful
of
cranberries
and
dipped
them
in
cognac
based
syrup
this
is
a
big
bold
beer
i
respect
lagunitas
for
putting
this
beast
into
a
decently
affordable
sixpack
i
only
bought
a
single
would
not
buy
a
6pack
too
boozy
for
me
but
for
about
10
dollars
a
sixpack
of
this
would
floor
you
i
respect
this
beer
do
not
love
it
overall
impression
a
wellbalanced
american
strong
ale
not
hoppy
enough
to
scratch
the
itch
not
malty
enough
to
put
it
over
the
top
not
my
favorite
lagunitas
beer
but
a
very
solid
example
the
appearance
is
a
dark
copper
brown
with
foamy
but
thin
head
that
retains
well
and
leaves
nice
sea
foam
lace
teh
smell
is
sweet
and
malty
with
caramel
and
honey
notes
followed
by
earthy
and
spicey
hops
on
the
back
some
dark
fruit
peeks
through
too
the
taste
follows
the
nose
this
is
a
malty
sweet
beer
in
the
vein
of
dopplebock
caramel
honey
and
notes
of
toffee
with
herbal
spicey
notes
of
hops
with
some
hints
of
nutmeg
and
dark
fruit
like
raisins
and
fig
hints
of
roasted
malt
and
chocolate
overall
a
medium
bodied
beer
that
is
well
balanced
easy
to
drink
i
wasnt
expecting
to
enjoy
this
much
because
the
last
lagunitas
i
had
was
a
let
down
and
it
scarred
me
but
i
loved
this
flavorful
and
big
with
some
weight
yet
easy
to
drink
overall
aside
from
the
look
of
the
stuff
there
really
isnt
much
here
it
leaves
a
bit
to
be
desired
grant
it
its
bitter
enough
to
make
you
grow
hair
on
hairless
parts
of
the
body
but
thats
it
my
opinion
if
you
want
an
average
ale
that
is
nice
to
look
at
buy
this
overall
this
was
a
pretty
good
strong
ale
it
was
a
good
deal
not
a
bad
easy
drink
or
sipper
the
9
adds
a
nicenonintrusive
touch
overall
this
is
a
big
beer
super
satisfying
and
very
enjoyable
overall
a
great
beer
and
deceptively
high
in
alcohol
by
volume
i
would
never
guess
it
was
9
maybe
7
at
the
highest
once
again
lagunitas
has
it
under
control
a
much
sweeter
strong
ale
than
id
generally
expect
from
the
style
has
a
barleywine
sort
of
character
while
it
isnt
the
best
beer
ive
had
it
certainly
is
worth
seeking
out
and
tasting
lagunitas
has
yet
to
disappoint
me
and
this
certainly
follows
that
trend
probably
good
to
have
something
sweet
to
pair
with
it
seems
like
ive
seen
this
all
before
from
this
brewery
but
im
not
really
complaining
not
about
a
solid
strong
west
coast
ale
well
maybe
the
booze
isnt
quite
as
well
integrated
as
it
usually
is
but
thats
just
splitting
hairs
i
could
see
hitting
a
sixer
of
these
if
perchance
i
wanted
to
get
my
drink
on
and
yet
at
the
same
time
enjoy
it
all
the
way
through
overall
overall
a
good
beer
very
dominant
and
strong
to
be
would
be
best
served
in
the
winter
on
a
cold
day
overall
this
was
a
one
sided
meh
although
it
had
personally
hyped
me
with
its
appearance
o
this
was
an
interesting
beer
and
a
good
one
one
of
the
better
offerings
i
have
had
from
a
brewery
that
i
dont
generally
care
for
o
it
grew
on
me
as
i
drank
it
but
i
wish
it
was
a
little
more
balanced
i
wouldnt
buy
again
but
this
is
rare
from
a
brewery
such
as
lagunitas
overall
not
bad
o
eh
not
a
huge
fan
of
strong
ales
in
general
but
its
alright
a
few
of
these
would
definitely
get
me
pretty
tipsy
and
the
boozy
taste
would
get
me
feelin
it
after
1
its
alright
t
sweet
and
malty
upfront
with
a
slight
citrus
hop
bite
towards
the
middle
im
getting
kind
of
a
strange
burnt
flavor
in
there
as
well
as
a
bit
of
beef
jerky
and
coffee
flavor
towards
the
finish
its
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
for
me
and
theres
not
quite
enough
hop
bitterness
or
carbonation
to
tone
it
down
o
not
my
favorite
by
any
means
but
not
a
bad
goto
american
strong
ale
that
is
easy
to
find
overallanother
nice
beer
glad
my
buddy
had
this
because
this
is
one
of
those
beers
i
always
walk
by
and
i
should
probably
drink
these
more
often
all
in
all
i
guess
i
could
compare
this
to
a
doppelbock
or
even
a
belgian
dark
ale
with
bitterness
on
the
backend
o
ok
bit
of
a
strong
brown
ale
not
amazing
i
like
strong
beers
but
im
not
sure
id
have
more
than
1
of
these
in
a
session
meh
o
a
brew
that
i
pulled
from
my
cellar
because
most
of
the
good
beer
stores
are
closed
and
i
didnt
feel
like
going
out
and
because
i
wasnt
too
excited
about
aging
it
it
just
got
tossed
down
there
certainly
a
pleasant
experience
but
nothing
to
rave
about
also
i
didnt
check
the
date
but
im
pretty
sure
its
not
fresh
d
the
alcohol
is
hidden
but
the
effects
are
not
i
feel
buzzed
almost
immediately
definitely
a
sipper
for
me
d
for
9
abv
pretty
drinkable
nice
balance
of
flavors
and
they
are
decently
complex
a
bit
full
and
heavy
so
a
bit
more
of
a
sipper
but
still
really
enjoyable
o
just
peachy
keen
i
love
this
beer
overall
though
this
one
struck
me
as
a
real
find
and
a
keeper
im
a
big
fan
overall
this
isnt
bad
the
9
abv
could
be
balanced
out
better
so
this
one
is
a
sipper
overall
good
tasting
beer
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
but
the
cereal
flavor
was
ultimately
too
dominant
and
beyond
that
i
drank
a
full
12oz
of
it
and
am
still
not
really
sure
what
the
hell
it
was
its
a
pretty
solid
brew
different
for
sure
very
flavorful
and
complex
o
not
too
shabby
but
it
could
be
a
little
better
balanced
as
with
most
beers
lagunitas
makes
this
brew
reflects
a
lot
of
hard
work
and
thought
along
with
quality
ingredients
resulting
in
a
tasty
and
enjoyable
beer
id
gladly
drink
again
pours
a
very
dark
ambermahogany
thin
offwhite
head
that
dissipates
quickly
but
leaves
some
lacing
rich
malt
aroma
plenty
of
dark
fruitraisin
caramel
chocolate
some
resinous
hop
presence
tons
of
malt
flavor
rich
sweet
chocolate
raisin
caramel
good
hop
bitterness
to
balance
it
well
full
body
and
a
thick
and
creamy
mouthfeel
a
very
well
balanced
malty
strong
ale
o
a
really
good
beer
from
a
really
good
brewery
this
one
poured
a
very
dark
amber
almost
brownish
color
with
some
big
beige
head
and
good
lacing
on
it
smells
like
heavy
malt
with
a
bit
of
alcohol
coming
through
not
bad
though
taste
is
rich
roasted
malt
and
molasses
not
much
alcohol
taste
coming
through
which
is
good
this
is
on
the
high
end
of
a
medium
mouthfeel
its
a
little
thicker
beer
but
it
goes
down
smooth
i
definitely
liked
this
beer
and
will
look
for
it
again
for
being
9
alcohol
it
tastes
great
and
goes
down
very
easy
overall
a
decent
brew
i
couldnt
get
passed
that
feeling
that
what
i
was
drinking
was
just
syrup
with
alcohol
almost
the
consistency
of
a
cough
medicine
i
didnt
think
it
was
really
that
bad
in
the
taste
and
i
think
the
hops
bitterness
really
saved
this
beer
from
become
a
syrup
bomb
the
first
couple
of
times
i
tried
this
i
just
drank
it
out
of
the
bottle
and
i
didnt
like
it
that
much
the
strong
taste
of
belgium
yeast
was
over
powering
not
this
time
it
was
poured
into
a
glass
and
became
a
different
beer
quite
enjoyable
if
you
get
a
chance
to
pick
this
one
up
do
and
dont
sip
it
out
of
the
bottle
on
a
camping
trip
pour
it
out
and
let
the
beer
do
the
talking
pours
a
dark
brown
letting
light
through
easily
minimal
head
scent
is
of
musty
earthy
hops
and
combines
with
a
strong
molasses
and
fig
backbone
taste
is
slightly
thin
in
complexity
and
the
body
follows
suit
with
some
wateryness
taste
brings
some
more
fruittyness
with
spice
but
the
earhty
and
musty
hops
cover
up
much
of
this
one
of
the
weaker
flavored
and
bodied
strong
ales
i
have
had
good
brew
this
is
why
lagunitas
will
always
be
a
favorite
of
mine
o
very
rich
and
warm
flavours
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
in
taste
and
balanced
by
the
sweetness
but
detectable
in
the
dryness
but
very
drinkable
as
expected
lagunitas
never
fails
to
impress
medium
mouthfeel
and
just
a
hint
of
booziness
overall
a
good
offering
and
different
enough
to
be
interesting
dn
a
very
good
beer
although
not
very
drinkable
not
complex
and
flavorful
enough
to
keep
me
wanting
more
worth
a
try
if
you
come
across
it
though
olagunitas
doesnt
disappoint
but
this
brew
is
a
bit
all
over
the
place
i
like
this
brew
it
is
not
a
wowzer
came
out
in
january
woulda
been
perfect
a
couple
weeks
ago
nice
late
winter
heavy
ale
overall
this
one
just
did
not
work
for
me
the
unique
dark
roast
flavors
found
in
hairy
eyeball
clash
with
the
hops
then
again
im
not
a
big
fan
of
bsdas
which
i
think
this
closely
resembles
so
your
mileage
may
vary
the
mouthfeel
is
almost
oppressive
in
its
thickness
i
honestly
wasnt
expecting
anything
nearly
this
thick
its
also
a
little
bit
too
smooth
it
makes
the
hop
prickle
at
the
end
feel
just
a
bit
awkward
overall
this
is
a
pretty
confused
brew
i
mean
it
tastes
alright
but
i
just
never
feel
everything
comes
together
to
making
something
absolutely
great
o
decent
offering
from
lagunitas
i
would
have
liked
bs
to
have
stuck
around
a
little
longer
or
a
rerelease
of
imperial
red
but
wtf
is
out
and
i
will
be
enjoying
plenty
of
that
pours
out
a
deep
brown
with
a
lasting
tan
head
aroma
is
boozy
sweet
with
ripe
apricot
and
nutty
caramel
taste
brings
out
the
nuttiness
in
a
big
way
with
sweet
caramel
following
with
a
slight
hint
of
cocoa
finishes
semidry
and
bitter
pretty
hopped
earthy
and
dark
and
warming
d
took
me
a
while
to
get
through
one
the
booze
was
coming
through
for
me
though
i
enjoyed
it
taking
my
time
with
it
body
is
medium
but
the
carbonation
is
very
smooth
and
makes
for
an
easy
to
drink
beer
overall
a
pretty
solid
brew
o
this
is
a
really
nice
strong
ale
not
overly
sweet
a
nice
hop
undertone
with
the
alcohol
pretty
well
hidden
this
beer
looks
pretty
nice
in
the
glass
dark
brown
in
color
with
a
thin
white
head
that
laced
a
little
smells
good
with
alot
of
dark
fruit
notes
and
bready
malt
aromas
palate
has
some
sweet
raisin
and
caramel
flavors
but
is
burdened
by
the
fusel
alcohol
and
the
illfitting
bitter
tannins
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
heavy
and
is
highly
carbonated
not
my
favorite
brew
by
any
means
but
could
suffice
on
a
cold
winter
night
interesting
and
rewarding
much
going
on
hairy
eyeball
ale
was
a
true
oddity
although
the
appearance
and
mouthfeel
were
exceptional
both
the
taste
and
aroma
were
hugely
disappointing
i
felt
like
the
life
had
been
sucked
from
this
beer
overall
surprisingly
not
the
hop
bomb
that
lagunitas
loves
to
make
this
has
a
lot
of
dark
beer
character
and
just
a
bit
of
hop
profile
very
interesting
overall
a
huge
flavor
ale
and
surprisingly
easy
to
drink
given
the
abv
di
like
this
asa
because
it
is
not
overly
hoppy
which
was
a
bit
of
a
surprise
nice
change
of
pace
and
certainly
a
solid
offering
by
lagunitas
overall
although
not
my
favorite
from
this
brewery
another
solid
offering
from
the
boys
at
laginitas
o
overall
definitely
worth
a
try
as
it
has
some
unique
properties
the
abv
goes
completely
undetected
not
my
favourite
by
lagunitas
but
still
a
very
tasty
offering
not
bad
not
great
there
are
better
beers
from
lagunitas
which
i
would
prefer
in
the
future
d
this
definitely
has
a
pretty
low
drinkability
for
me
partially
due
to
the
abv
but
also
because
there
are
simply
better
beers
in
this
style
that
i
can
find
fairly
easily
worth
a
try
but
not
much
more
than
that
o
its
a
solid
offering
getting
plenty
of
bang
for
your
buck
packed
with
booze
that
almost
overpowers
the
flavors
at
times
its
a
personal
one
and
done
kind
of
beers
where
i
enjoy
it
but
get
rather
sick
of
it
worth
trying
pours
an
extremely
dark
brown
color
with
a
medium
offwhite
head
that
disappears
quickly
scent
is
malty
with
a
bit
of
chocolate
and
a
hint
of
dark
fruits
taste
is
wow
didnt
see
this
coming
from
a
beer
with
not
much
going
on
in
the
nose
this
beer
is
very
sweet
maybe
a
little
overly
sweet
i
initially
get
overly
sugary
molasses
with
a
tad
bit
of
chocolate
lots
of
dark
fruit
flavors
with
a
bit
of
alcohol
flavors
are
not
blended
together
very
well
imo
alcohol
is
pretty
well
hidden
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
for
such
a
big
beer
drinkability
is
fair
this
is
not
my
favorite
beer
from
lagunitas
i
feel
like
its
the
inbred
offspring
of
gnarleywine
imperial
stout
and
a
quad
of
some
sort
if
you
want
some
bang
for
your
buck
though
cant
beat
the
price
d
i
might
try
and
put
a
couple
of
these
in
the
cellar
to
see
if
itll
improve
im
not
overly
confident
though
dark
ruby
red
with
a
creamcolored
head
with
some
pretty
dense
structure
that
looks
like
its
going
to
cling
well
the
smell
is
malty
with
some
leatherymusty
notes
as
you
drink
the
lace
makes
rings
around
the
glass
that
stick
there
and
forces
you
to
wash
them
out
at
first
sip
i
thought
i
was
getting
an
alcohol
burn
on
the
tongue
but
its
the
hops
asserting
themselves
with
bitterness
the
flavor
given
off
by
the
hops
is
resinous
pine
and
that
adds
to
the
feel
of
mustiness
or
tobacco
but
less
so
than
what
you
get
in
the
nose
the
malts
add
some
molasses
which
goes
in
with
the
mouthfeel
this
beer
clings
to
the
lips
and
coats
the
tongue
in
an
oily
sort
of
way
theres
a
lot
going
on
in
this
beer
and
it
doesnt
all
seem
to
work
all
that
well
together
the
hops
are
adding
more
bitterness
than
flavor
and
the
malts
dont
deliver
enough
of
a
balancing
sweetness
balance
would
satisfy
the
style
standard
for
an
english
strong
ale
the
brewers
association
does
not
offer
one
for
american
strong
ales
beeradvocate
is
no
help
referring
to
the
style
as
a
catchall
so
ill
rate
it
against
the
english
style
and
continue
to
complain
about
it
not
being
balanced
d
i
have
a
certain
disdain
for
normal
beer
thats
like
everything
else
in
regards
to
style
but
i
wont
argue
its
bad
because
its
certainly
not
its
just
like
every
other
strong
ale
there
is
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
here
and
is
actually
a
bit
wetting
to
the
palate
the
burn
of
alcohol
is
not
detectable
which
makes
this
a
bit
of
a
dangerous
beer
much
too
easy
to
consume
for
the
fact
of
being
a
higher
abvd
beer
had
this
one
on
draft
at
abbaye
served
in
a
tulip
shaped
glass
pours
a
dark
brown
with
little
head
little
aroma
of
dark
malts
tastes
like
brown
sugar
molasses
raisin
fig
no
noticeable
hop
character
interesting
beer
a
real
sipper
due
to
its
complex
profile
couldnt
even
notice
the
high
abv
enjoyed
it
would
try
it
again
i
found
this
to
be
a
very
interesting
beer
i
gave
it
a
4
0
for
mouthfeel
i
dont
know
if
the
feel
is
good
or
bad
just
very
very
unique
a
bit
thick
on
the
mouth
and
not
easy
to
drink
quickly
i
like
this
on
draft
not
sure
if
its
something
id
pick
up
a
six
pack
of
though
o
went
down
very
easily
not
overly
sweet
could
easily
knock
back
a
few
more
of
these
drink
there
are
a
lot
of
different
flavour
going
on
which
makes
it
a
nice
beer
to
switch
things
up
with
the
alcohol
became
more
evident
as
the
beer
approached
room
temperature
an
above
average
beer
that
makes
a
good
winter
warmersipper
drinkability
the
drinkability
is
good
i
could
finish
a
few
and
then
regret
it
watch
out
for
the
high
abv
lagunitas
doesnt
make
weak
beer
d
i
surprisingly
finished
the
12oz
bottle
easily
i
love
big
beers
so
i
was
able
to
muscle
thru
it
but
i
will
not
grab
another
overall
this
beer
seemed
a
bit
of
a
mess
malty
and
strong
are
about
all
i
can
say
about
it
the
flavor
was
pretty
uninteresting
and
became
even
more
so
as
i
finished
my
glass
d
unfortunately
i
liked
this
beer
less
and
less
as
i
drank
it
i
almost
drainpoured
the
last
quarter
or
so
the
dominant
flavors
are
a
strong
raisiny
malty
sweetness
and
a
bitterness
that
lacks
the
nicer
attributes
of
hops
i
think
i
can
see
where
they
were
going
with
it
but
it
lacks
fullness
and
balance
in
the
flavor
i
find
it
too
strong
in
malt
and
alcohol
without
sufficient
other
flavors
to
smooth
them
out
d
a
decent
brew
perhaps
a
touch
too
sweet
and
nothing
really
extraordinary
about
the
flavors
the
taste
presents
a
heavy
dark
fruit
vibe
with
a
constant
edge
of
hops
to
keep
it
from
going
all
belgian
dark
on
you
alcohol
is
a
bit
high
but
the
finish
is
surprisingly
clean
some
smokiness
adds
to
the
already
mighty
complexity
there
is
a
lot
going
on
here
most
of
it
good
but
sessionable
it
is
not
more
of
a
nightcap
type
thing
d
definitely
drinkable
high
alcohol
content
at
9
but
it
is
not
so
present
in
the
taste
tasty
but
looses
its
zip
a
bit
after
a
while
medium
to
heavy
mouthfeel
slightly
syrupy
overall
a
decent
drinker
havent
noticed
the
strong
alcohol
content
yet
wish
i
grabbed
a
few
of
these
as
i
always
seem
to
with
lagunitas
i
had
no
idea
this
was
a
strong
ale
going
in
and
have
to
say
it
exceeded
my
expectations
dont
let
others
thoughts
stray
you
this
is
a
must
try
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
heavier
side
with
carbonation
being
a
little
below
average
the
drinkability
was
good
i
enjoyed
it
a
lot
it
was
pretty
bold
in
both
hoppy
and
malty
categories
but
managed
to
integrate
them
together
pretty
nicely
it
reminded
me
a
little
of
arrogant
bastard
actually
only
more
sweet
pretty
nice
beer
overall
d
this
is
very
tasty
and
seems
to
be
akin
to
a
dubbelstrong
brown
ale
blend
d
warms
the
belly
and
drinks
a
bit
hotter
than
the
abv
would
indicate

deep

almost
opaque
with
a
inch
tall
offwhite
head
that
dissapates
slowly
and
leaves
beautiful
lacing
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
the
only
thing
from
this
beer
that
lacks
at
all
but
not
too
bad
as
hints
of
alcohol
and
slight
resiny
hops
come
through
the
taste
is
huge
and
robust
though
hitting
the
palate
with
a
big
bold
flavor
of
creamy
malts
and
crisp
hops
that
is
balanced
perfectly
by
a
coffee
bitterness
that
finishes
the
taste
off
with
a
creamy
yet
crisp
mouthfeel
this
beer
is
good
for
most
people
who
like
a
good
strong
beer
without
being
overwhelmed
by
the
alcohol
flavor
its
there
but
only
as
an
afterthought
despite
being
9
percent
this
makes
it
surprisingly
easy
to
drink
but
beware
because
it
packs
an
unsuspected
wollop
great
beer
from
lagunitas
a
decent
example
of
the
style
though
there
is
nothing
that
sets
this
one
apart
from
others
except
that
it
has
no
obvious
flaws
very
clean
but
not
distinguishable
d

big
hit
from
lagunitas
one
of
my
favorite
brews
of
2010
smooth

with
a

balanced

recommend
it

this
beer
is

the

medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
sticky
sweet
candy
sugar
aftertaste
nice
big
ale
but
kind
of
line
and
average
abv
is
hidden
well
and
is
very
easy
to
drink
the
big
complex
flavors
are
very
nice
really
reminiscent
of
arrogant
bastard
for
me
the
alcohol
is
a
touch
overstated
this
beer
could
probably
use
some
time
to
mellow
out
but
really
overall
a
good
tasting
beer
if
you
want
to
go
to
sleep
with
a
warming
beer
definitely
try
this
one
out
although
its
not
a
style
that
i
prefer
this
one
is
still
a
good
one
sweet
malty
smooth
just
the
right
amount
of
hops
and
plenty
of
alcohol
without
tasting
like
it
try
it
d
despite
high
abv
alcohol
is
well
masked
makes
for
an
easy
sipper
d
skip
this
and
go
straight
to
the
gnarlywine
cheers
d
the
drinkability
is
good
its
easy
to
drink
and
tastes
great
i
really
like
this
beer
and
im
glad
i
got
the
chance
to
pick
some
up
i
recommend
giving
it
a
try
interesting
beer
but
didnt
really
appeal
to
me
for
some
reason
the
taste
was
just
not
what
i
was
expecting
sort
of
weird
flavor
combination
closest
to
a
winter
warmer
maybe
but
more
potent
overall
this
was
a
little
meh
for
me
so
far
i
have
not
enjoyed
any
of
the
lagunitas
offerings
still
searching
for
something
impressive
from
them
d
another
fine
sipping
strong
ale
from
lagunitas
they
always
seem
to
make
their
hops
known
as
evidence
by
this
brew
as
well
but
with
a
delicate
and
complex
malt
balance
too
many
of
these
brews
at
9
abv
in
one
sitting
and
the
next
day
you
probably
realize
why
its
called
hairy
eyeball
finish
is
smooth
with
a
subtle
bitterness
glassware
tulip
drinkabilty
ive
avoided
this
beer
for
a
couple
of
years
for
some
reason
i
wont
anymore
this
is
a
great
malt
forward
strong
ale
sweet
and
toasty
md
goes
down
really
smooth
its
not
quite
as
heavy
as
it
looks
its
a
nice
easily
drinkable
brew
that
lagunitas
has
made
for
the
9
i
would
say
the
drinkability
is
average
the
alcohol
is
not
very
well
hidden
and
the
harsh
bitter
nature
does
not
promote
more
drinks
probably
the
most
disappointing
lagunitas
i
have
had
perhaps
it
is
just
a
bad
bottle
d
a
sipping
beer
good
taste
just
hard
to
drink
in
multiples
this
is
yummy
as
hell
rich
thick
and
powerfula
real
sipper
love
it
hairy
eyeball
ale
pours
a
mix
of
smooth
and
burnt
caramels
with
some
amber
highlights
the
head
and
lacing
is
small
and
brief
quickly
dissipating
into
the
brew
it
smells
strongly
of
brown
sugar
molasses
and
a
hint
of
pineapple
i
find
the
taste
for
this
one
pretty
jumbled
and
not
quite
complementary
at
first
sip
youre
greeted
with
a
rush
of
sticky
sweet
brown
sugar
and
honey
which
is
countered
with
tart
grapefruit
notes
of
prune
and
red
fruit
finish
off
the
palate
the
beer
has
a
medium
body
with
a
slight
silkiness
i
can
barely
see
myself
finishing
off
the
12
ounce
bottle
of
this
one
the
sweetbitter
tastes
are
more
than
a
bit
cloying
on
the
tongue
not
one
i
plan
to
have
again
d
very
drinkable
not
too
high
in
alcohol
content
so
a
great
drinker
if
youre
looking
for
a
decent
six
pack
i
liked
it
but
still
pretty
expensive
in
this
part
of
the
world
a
fair
bit
going
on
with
this
beer
im
curious
to
what
some
aging
would
do
for
it
drinkability
is
good
for
a
9
0
beer
i
could
sip
a
few
of
these
over
a
long
cold
evening
lagunitas
can
do
other
things
well
besides
hop
bombs
walnut
colored
pour
with
a
very
healthy
mocha
colored
head
that
stays
put
not
much
of
a
smell
but
the
taste
is
pretty
good
more
malty
molasses
and
coffee
up
front
and
a
more
bitter
burnt
back
end
the
alcohol
is
hidden
up
front
and
comes
out
at
the
end
its
like
eating
hot
chips
and
salsa
as
long
as
you
keep
eating
it
is
great
once
you
stop
it
is
not
as
nice
packs
a
punch
i
prefer
the
sweeter
brown
sugga
but
this
is
pretty
good
i
love
the
rich
creamy
malts
in
this
beer
very
tasty
drink
ability
is
decent
the
high
abv
and
the
fullness
of
the
beer
limit
to
1
maybe
2
a
night
drinkability
this
has
some
elements
of
a
standard
barleywine
its
just
a
little
bit
boozy
but
not
that
well
balanced
d
this
is
really
drinkable
and
very
different
from
what
i
remember
the
first
time
i
tried
it
there
are
many
layers
of
flavor
here
and
i
am
not
sure
if
its
complex
or
just
all
over
the
place
but
a
nice
beer
nonetheless
drinkability
i
really
like
this
and
it
is
different
from
my
previous
experience
with
lagunitas
ipa
maximus
hop
stoopid
brown
shugga
i
was
always
under
the
impression
that
their
beers
were
very
american
and
this
is
labeled
as
an
american
strong
ale
however
this
is
very
english
and
noticing
a
little
belgian
now
but
innovative
as
it
seems
to
be
an
english
strong
ale
stout
hybrid
also
this
is
9
wow
completely
hidden
i
would
have
guessed
more
like
7
the
entire
aftertaste
and
palate
feel
follows
suit
as
you
get
this
rough
feeling
around
the
mouth
as
if
you
chewed
paan
and
have
a
leafy
tobacco
taste
in
your
mouth
its
actually
really
nice
drinkability
is
less
for
this
due
to
the
rough
feel
building
up
a
little
bit
but
the
beer
is
well
bodied
and
certainly
hides
the
9
abv
perfectly
this
beer
drinks
well
and
i
was
surprised
to
learn
the
alcohol
content
perfect
for
a
night
when
i
am
just
having
one
beer
to
unwind
completely
great
drinkabilty
at
9
not
something
you
can
drink
much
of
this
is
a
soild
ale
but
it
lacks
balance
and
flavor
this
is
a
arrogant
bastard
clone
and
not
a
better
one
its
decent
but
not
something
id
select
over
arrogant
bastard
im
going
to
say
that
this
is
the
best
american
use
of
belgian
yeast
that
ive
experienced
thus
far
in
a
lot
of
other
beers
the
yeast
comes
across
with
a
strong
phenolicpeppery
character
but
its
smooth
as
silk
here
very
strong
caramel
malt
profile
with
a
decent
hop
balance
very
thick
mouthfeel
almost
viscous
easy
drinking
with
a
wellmasked
high
abv
go
for
this
sweet
baby
you
shant
regret
it
overall
good
beer
overall
this
seems
like
a
bastard
version
of
a
belgian
ale
i
could
see
this
cellaring
very
well
not
the
best
beer
ive
had
from
lagunitas
by
far
but
its
still
worth
trying
drinkability
not
a
bad
brew
at
all
i
dont
love
the
taste
but
its
pretty
unique
and
interesting
one
of
these
is
enough
for
me
not
digging
the
heavy
figgy
malt
profile
nice
imperial
red
alestrong
ale
d
very
filling
cant
imagine
more
than
one
per
sitting
but
enjoyable
and
if
offered
i
would
gladly
accept
another
in
another
sitting
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
in
body
and
slightly
creamy
final
thought
such
a
unique
beer
love
that
its
seasonal
instead
of
chocolate
or
strawberries
in
the
bedroom
try
this
awesome
beer
pours
a
dark
reddishbrown
that
has
an
off
white
head
that
has
good
retention
and
very
good
lacing
the
smell
is
a
pleasant
sweet
smell
of
sweet
malts
sugars
and
some
dark
fruits
the
taste
is
caramel
molasses
followed
by
a
nutty
and
maple
flavor
than
get
some
raisins
mixed
in
and
it
finishes
off
with
a
slight
citrus
taste
at
the
end
the
after
taste
is
a
sugary
sweetness
mixed
with
a
little
bitterness
from
some
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
creamy
but
thanks
to
the
sugars
it
becomes
sticky
on
the
lips
and
tongue
i
know
this
has
9
0
abv
according
to
the
beer
bottle
but
can
hardly
taste
the
alcohol
and
the
good
taste
and
balance
makes
me
want
to
drink
more
than
one
but
i
only
bought
one
for
1
99
plus
tax
and
deposit
for
those
who
have
not
tried
this
go
out
and
buy
one
and
i
think
you
might
buy
another
malts
made
me
barely
finish
this
one
d
hides
its
9
abv
very
well
i
could
easily
go
through
a
sixer
this
is
a
very
good
beer
a
true
lagunitas
classic
going
with
there
style
it
doesnt
fit
into
a
certain
category
like
most
american
barleywine
and
strong
ale
its
hard
to
decide
i
wouldnt
say
the
drinkability
is
too
high
with
this
one
definitely
not
something
youd
have
more
than
one
of
but
its
enjoyable
while
its
in
the
glass
probably
just
a
bit
above
average
for
a
beer
of
the
style
this
beer
pours
a
mahogany
color
the
head
is
a
quarter
inch
in
height
and
recedes
quickly
into
a
thin
cap
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
caramel
pine
and
citrus
it
is
rather
pungent
but
quite
simple
the
taste
has
more
caramel
than
the
aroma
which
i
think
is
a
really
good
thing
there
is
still
a
noticeable
hop
presence
however
it
is
in
the
form
of
a
rounded
bitterness
on
the
tongue
and
a
lively
bite
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumfull
bodied
with
sprightly
carbonation
and
a
smooth
texture
overall
this
is
a
nice
beer
that
i
would
happily
drink
again
the
aroma
is
pretty
generic
but
the
taste
is
solid
and
for
this
beer
that
is
enough
excellent
beer
excellent
taste
for
the
most
part
i
love
everything
that
lagunitas
has
to
offer
well
balanced
and
exceptionally
tasting
beers
what
more
could
you
want
especially
from
a
high
abv
beer
good
stuff
keep
it
coming
lagunitas
9
more
letters
despite
the
alcohol
being
well
hidden
id
definitely
say
this
beer
is
a
sipper
im
not
sure
how
much
longer
this
beer
will
age
will
be
interested
in
revisiting
it
in
a
few
more
months
poured
into
a
snifter
the
color
is
a
nice
really
dark
redamber
with
a
really
thin
head
that
doesnt
really
last
the
nose
is
strong
and
malty
with
some
brown
sugar
caramel
dark
fruits
and
a
bit
of
light
booze
really
nice
and
complex
the
taste
is
some
brown
sugar
and
light
dark
fruits
the
feel
is
a
bit
boozy
but
quite
nice
with
a
good
body
and
drinks
well
i
found
this
to
be
pretty
similar
to
the
brown
shugga
maybe
it
is
because
i
just
reviewed
that
one
as
well
however
i
did
find
this
one
more
to
my
liking
the
body
was
thick
still
easy
to
drink
the
carbonation
was
perfect
the
feel
was
syrupy
in
the
mouth
and
chalky
through
the
finish
would
make
an
excellent
winter
warmer
or
a
fantastic
dessert
found
this
on
tap
at
the
mellow
mushroom
in
greensboro
nc
it
shows
a
very
opaque
black
color
chilled
in
a
nice
goblet
it
has
a
giant
milkshakelike
light
tan
head
with
tons
of
lacing
left
behind
the
aroma
brings
malty
caramel
and
yeasty
evergreen
with
a
sweet
brandy
touch
neat
the
flavor
brings
a
sort
of
dr
pepper
malt
blend
with
some
hints
of
whiskey
and
maybe
juniper
toffee
there
are
some
chocolate
and
maple
brown
bread
ideas
milling
around
as
well
this
is
mediumheavy
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
it
has
a
thick
near
syrupy
feel
and
is
not
highly
drinkable
in
my
book
very
good
interesting
stuff
although
it
seemed
somewhat
unbalanced
hard
to
capture
on
the
taste
buds
almost
harsh
alcohol
is
notable
this
poured
a
deep
dark
red
with
a
2
finger
head
some
fruity
esters
and
very
mild
pine
like
hops
very
malty
and
sweet
kind
of
like
a
dopplebock
hint
of
raisins
and
brown
sugar
this
is
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
i
would
seek
out
another
one
of
these
the
eyeball
is
much
darker
than
i
expected
it
to
be
it
has
a
shallow
head
and
laces
nicely
in
the
glass
it
smells
delicious
and
carries
hint
of
aroma
that
gives
it
that
true
strong
ale
character
i
really
enjoy
the
strong
yet
full
flavor
with
a
very
nice
blend
of
healthy
malts
and
mild
hops
the
going
down
is
just
right
for
a
complete
beer
experience
and
the
tastey
sips
invite
a
second
bottle
solid
beer
but
not
my
thing
when
picking
a
slightly
similar
beer
from
lagunitas
portfolio
i
would
go
with
some
brown
shugga
instead
drank
easy
but
not
super
enjoyable
not
the
beer
for
me
d
i
drank
six
and
so
can
you
d
pretty
good
stuff
the
abv
and
heavy
flavor
make
it
tough
to
session
but
one
will
do
md
thick
creamy
and
delicious
if
you
can
take
the
abv
you
could
drink
it
all
night
kind
of
like
an
india
black
ale
but
it
could
be
hoppier

lagunitas
has
a
way
of
making
beers
that
sneak
up
on
you
drinkabilityconsidering
the
abvthe
drinkability
is
good
but
the
sweetness
could
become
cloying
after
two
havent
had
this
beer
in
a
long
while
i
opened
a
5
year
old
bottle
of
this
a
few
weeks
ago
and
unfortunately
it
went
down
the
drain
this
beer
doesnt
strike
me
as
one
to
be
aged
for
that
period
of
time
maybe
a
year
or
two
thats
about
it
would
definitely
purchase
this
again
poured
into
a
pint
glass
this
brew
is
a
deep
amber
color
that
has
a
nice
2
finger
off
white
head
that
lasts
real
long
leaving
sticky
lacing
after
each
sip
the
aroma
is
of
burnt
caramel
some
toffee
slight
apricot
and
fig
notes
the
taste
is
a
little
milder
than
the
aroma
led
it
to
be
some
nice
malts
up
front
with
decent
toffee
sweetness
and
a
slight
mild
bitter
finish
alcohol
is
definitely
in
the
back
of
my
throat
lacing
a
nice
warm
sensation
this
is
a
decent
brew
but
not
sure
if
good
on
a
hot
summer
night
to
have
more
than
one
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a

and

i

is
the
same
its
roasted
malts
and

some

fruitssome
chocolate
and
toast
put
is
some

hops
and
finish
it
off
with
some
brown
sugar
mouth
feel
is
heavy
medium
and
robust
with
a
nicely
balanced
strong
ale
i
could
only
drink
1
of
these
but
i
did
enjoy
it
will
buy
in
singles
again
and
recommend
this
one
jd
i
find
this
quite
difficult
to
drink
because
the
sweetness
is
very
strong
this
beer
can
use
quite
a
bit
more
balance
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
but
just
a
tad
bit
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
overall
a
decent
strong
ale
typical
on
all
points
nothing
stands
out
for
me
though

this

warmer
glad
to
have
had
a
chance
to
sample
d
a
cleaner

would
have
increased
the
drinkability
and
overall
score
drinks
like
a

d
i
think
i
might
grab
a
few
and
cellar
them
i
have
always
had
good
luck
cellaring
their

this
was
a
joy
to

drinkable

with
two
or
three
of
these
babies
and
really
enjoy
them
this
makes
for
a
great
desert
beer
even
in
its
mild
demeanor
i
wish
i
had
picked
up
a
six
pack
and
not
just
a
single
ill
be
back
for
more
powerful
so
start
the
night
off
with
this
one
d
mellow
and
well
balanced
seemed
to
be
the
opposite
of
their
undercover
investigation
ale
which
is
hops
then
malts
the
hairy
eyeball
starts
out
with
a
nice
malt
sweetness
balanced
out
with
the
slightly
bitter
hop
finish
leans
towards
a
sipper
but
if
youre
into
it
i
could
see
drinking
a
couple
it
was
good
but
didnt
do
much
for
me
drinkability
it
is
a
brew
to
savour
and
enjoy
not
something
to
pound
a
six
pack
of
in
one
sitting
i
dont
know
what
category
this
falls
under
it
is
not
hopped
enough
to
call
this
a
barley
wine
but
it
has
more
bitterness
than
you
would
expect
in
a
classic
example
of
old
ale
dwell
done
big
flavorful
complex
incredibly
well
balanced
and
best
of
all
way
tasty
hard
to
believe
its
9
abv
another
great
brew
from
lagunitas
this
beauty
pours
a
dark
mahogany
with
an
initial
two
finger
tan
head
finishing
off
with
a
nice
sticky
lacing
the
whole
glass
has
a
sweet
toasted
malt
and
molasses
on
the
tongue
light
on
the
carbonation
with
a
mediumheavy
body
if
i
lived
in
petalumaca
there
would
be
not
a
taste
for
everyone
else
if
you
cant
get
it
road
trip
it
what
a
name
bizarre
yet
intriguing
ive
picked
up
a
six
of
this
before
but
it
was
so
good
it
got
downed
without
a
review
well
i
scored
another
marked
at
8
83
abv
so
lets
give
it
a
whirl
popping
the
top
yields
a
delicious
smell
of
brown
sugar
molasses
and
black
and
hint
red
licorice
pours
to
a
nice
translucent
deep
red
brown
with
a
thin
tan
head
taste
of
this
brew
is
complex
it
starts
with
a
chewy
roasted
malt
base
and
progresses
to
a
black
licorice
flavor
with
a
molasses
and
anise
slightly
bitter
finish
mouthfeel
is
extraordinary
it
starts
almost
syrup
thick
then
zests
ion
the
middle
with
carbonation
and
thins
not
overly
so
but
still
sticks
to
the
ribs
this
is
a
perfect
example
of
this
style
and
a
very
delicious
brew
this
brew
can
be
very
sneaky
at
8
83
abv
this
beer
is
also
an
extreme
value
as
a
six
pack
sells
for
less
than
most
four
packs
of
equal
or
lesser
quality
keep
up
the
good
work
lagunitas
may
have
to
cellar
a
few
to
see
what
pans
out
in
a
year
or
two
d
good
it
sips
well
perfect
for
spring
could
have
2
in
one
sitting
beautifully
poured
beer
at
mcnultys
pub
in
cleveland
heights
great
lacing
great
aroma
a
little
on
the
thin
side
in
the
mouth
which
seemed
to
accentuate
the
higher
abv
overall
quite
yummy
a
treat
a
sixer
would
be
a
full
evening
at
home
but
i
might
have
to
try
it
d
decent
strong
ale
for
sipping
but
not
necessarily
a
session
beer
given
the
high
8
80
abv
on
board
perhaps
a
nice
after
dinner
beer
the
8
80abv
is
minimally
noticed
but
gives
you
a
nice
fuzzy
feeling
with
a
mild
hint
of
warmth
perhaps
not
the
best
thing
to
slam
a
12pack
of
in
a
session
in
that
respect
but
its
tasty
enough
that
you
just
might
if
you
arent
keeping
track
of
your
intake
not
much
to
add
to
my
review
of
ontap
version
nose
and
flavor
wise
but
i
used
this
as
an
opportunity
to
compare
with
stones
arrogant
bastard
which
i
would
view
as
the
comparator
for
the
style
re
cali
strong
ale
i
thought
the
depth
of
flavor
re
malt
profile
balance
between
caramel
and
bread
and
hop
profile
more
aggressive
bitterness
on
back
end
tilts
scale
toward
the
eyeball
on
drinkability
though
a
this
abv
you
better
be
careful
i
certainly
prefer
the
tap
version
to
this
bottled
version
but
as
few
kegs
as
ive
seen
of
this
in
beervana
im
lucky
to
have
scored
this
bottle
the
big
question
is
whether
this
will
cellar
well
damn
i
should
have
grabbed
another
bottle
value
i
paid
2
49
for
a
single
not
bad
at
all
overall
this
is
certainly
a
good
beer
and
one
i
will
buy
again
for
sure
it
is
dangerously
smooth
and
tasty
and
a
favorite
from
this
brewer
i
seem
to
favor
their
browner
ales
vs
their
golden
d
the
high
alcohol
would
limit
drinkability
but
it
is
a
tasty
beer
definatly
a
sipper
in
my
mind
packs
a
little
bit
of
a
punch
definatly
overall
better
with
some
age
on
it
im
interested
to
see
what
even
another
year
will
do
to
my
one
remaining
bottle
i
would
suggest
aging
this
beer
if
you
got
the
room
i
wouldnt
really
go
out
of
my
way
to
do
it
again
though
poured
a
12oz
bottle
into
my
hennepin
globe
glass
this
beer
pours
a
mahogany
brown
with
ruby
highlights
when
held
up
to
the
light
a
massive
4
inch
creamy
beige
head
pours
out
of
the
bottle
leaving
a
rather
sparse
lacing
up
front
comes
dark
fruits
with
apples
and
pears
prunes
and
dates
with
just
a
little
bit
of
raisins
after
that
i
pick
up
some
piney
hops
the
flavor
is
big
and
malty
prunes
dates
over
ripe
apples
all
come
through
brown
sugar
with
just
a
little
bit
of
chocolate
the
hops
really
fade
out
of
the
flavor
profile
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
creamy
leaving
a
caramelized
brown
sugar
flavor
soaked
into
the
palate
once
again
lagunitas
has
made
a
good
big
beer
that
is
readily
available
and
affordable
gotta
love
lagunitas
mouthfeelsolid
carbonation
delivers
a
quick
bitter
sting
that
soon
gives
way
to
a
malty
sweetness
there
is
a
hoppy
bitterness
that
emerges
quickly
but
subsides
as
the
finish
yields
to
some
alcohol
warmth
not
hot
or
strong
can
alcohol
be
earthy
the
booziness
is
candy
like
i
usually
froth
on
the
palate
but
i
choose
to
roll
this
around
and
i
get
some
different
sweet
flavor
profiles
dried
fruit
finally
comes
through
bubblegum
even
this
is
certainly
a
strong
ale
and
i
got
a
case
of
this
along
with
a
case
of
brown
shugga
so
let
the
high
gravity
times
roll
lagunitas
never
disappoints
and
i
could
probably
sip
two
of
these
pours
a
nice
dark
transparent
coppery
brown
with
a
fairly
thick
pale
tan
head
that
dissipates
slowly
aroma
is
richly
malty
with
an
undertone
of
brown
sugar
and
a
hint
of
cloves
lively
flavor
is
malty
and
spicy
slightly
sweet
and
slightly
bitter
with
a
teensy
alcohol
bite
texture
is
fizzy
tingly
and
edgy
dancing
on
the
tongue
and
on
the
way
down
i
found
this
overly
sweet
and
had
to
make
an
effort
to
finish
it
for
that
reason
d
a
sipper
for
sure
a
decent
strong
ale
but
its
scent
reminds
me
too
much
of
a
flemish
red
ale
which
turns
me
off
to
seeking
it
out
any
time
in
the
near
future
drinkability
a
nice
and
big
malty
brew
one
of
my
favorites
from
the
brewery
one
per
serving
but
would
get
this
again
future
outlook
solid
if
unspectacular
beer
wont
be
a
beer
to
go
out
of
my
way
for
but
at
a
good
price
point
and
might
be
a
beer
to
enjoy
occasionally
poured
from
12oz
into

on
326
poured
dark
brown
with
1
finger
offwhite
head
this
one
smelled
sweet
figplum
sweet
malts
maybe
even
brown
sugar
no
hops
detected
the
taste
follows
with
a
little
more
caramel
and
slight
alcohol
heat
full
body
and
almost
syrupy
and
sticky
the
drinkability
is
average
due
to
sweetness
this
has
a
sticky
very
sweet
feel
about
it
to
me
this
has
a
light
feel
despite
being
a
tad
on
the
heavy
over
malted
side
this
one
will
surely
dry
you
out
so
keep
a
glass
of
water
available
drinkability
is
slightly
above
average
for
me
though
you
may
need
to
pace
yourself
with
this
too
much
and
it
may
be
lights
out
if
you
are
not
careful
drinkabilityfarily
drinkable
reminded
me
of
a
less
attentuated
backwoods
bastard
id
drink
this
again
if
it
were
priced
a
bit
less
this
was
a
pretty
unique
brew
definitely
satisfies
a
sweet
tooth
md
medium
to
fuller
body
medium
carbonation
other
then
that
mouthfeel
is
very
average
drinkability
is
okay
a
little
too
strong
on
the
alcohol
taste
that
lowers
this
score
for
me
abv
is
not
hidden
at
all
d
this
is
a
beer
that
really
needs
to
be
sipped
although
the
alcohol
is
masked
rather
well
i
couldnt
see
having
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
single
sitting
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
its
something
like
a
strong
brown
ale
but
with
quite
a
bit
of
hops
as
well
it
is
very
unique
and
my
first
lagunitas
beer
and
i
will
definitely
seek
out
more
dvery
drinkable
especially
for
a
high
abv
taste
is
almost
identical
to
the
nose
a
touch
sweet
with
toffee
light
brown
sugar
and
a
tiny
bit
of
roasted
malts
where
this
beer
loses
is
the
finish
to
me
a
tad
too
bitter
and
malty
balancing
the
rest
of
the
beer
but
not
part
of
the
same
equation
body
is
mostly
thin
but
the
alcohol
is
fairly
well
hidden
very
nice
american
ale
would
recommend
it
and
happy
that
i
have
two
more
bottles
thank
you
lagunitas
smooth
and
sweet
mouthfeel
almost
creamy
with
a
full
body
to
it
moderate
carbonation
quite
drinkable
for
the
abv
and
a
very
flavorful
complex
and
enjoyable
beer
this
brew
didnt
do
it
for
me
too
malt
forward
without
the
balance
to
pull
it
all
together
glad
to
try
it
but
probably
wont
be
trying
it
again
d
hairy
eyeball
is
a
good
american
strong
brew
from
the
west
coast
the
combination
of
malts
and
spices
makes
it
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
the
alcohol
is
very
strong
i
defintely
will
enjoy
one
or
two
of
these
at
a
time
drinkability
was
slightly
better
than
average
which
was
good
for
such
a
full
flavored
beer
puffy
foamy
cap
of
a
head
this
one
has
a
big
winter
spice
aroma
which
is
in
the
taste
as
well
this
could
fall
under
the
so
called
winter
warmer
catagory
which
is
as
ambiguos
as
the
strong
ale
catagory
this
one
is
sweeter
in
the
malt
dept
with
toffee
with
a
slight
alcohol
burn
but
nothing
major
some
fire
roasted
nuts
mixed
in
with
the
spices
carbination
is
kept
to
a
minimal
medium
density
slight
stickyness
detracts
from
the
drinkability
somewhat
the
color
is
a
heavy
brown
with
not
much
head
or
lacing
remaining
after
getting
a
look
at
it
ok
not
great
d
very
drinkable
with
forewarning
of
what
this
beer
is
good
drinkability
slightly
sweet
but
no
signs
of
abv
d
fairly
high
abv
at
over
8
8
but
is
oddly
easy
to
drink
i
could
put
a
few
of
these
12oz
bottles
down
without
too
much
hesitation

me
yet
again

theres
not

pretty

drink
it
slowly
nice
sipping

decent
offering
from
lagunitas
d
very
drinkable
despite
its
hairy
strength
outstanding
a
must
try
d
i
dont
know
what
this
beer
is
but
it
works
fine
as
a
nightcap
a
different
winter
beer
i
must
say
pours
out
a
dark
redbrown
with
a
nice
one
and
a
half
finger
head
that
ahs
good
retention
leaves
a
nice
medium
coat
of
lacing
and
a
decent
ring
stays
behind
atop
the
ale
smell
is
a
bit
boozy
maybe
more
than
a
bit
some
dark
malts
with
sugar
sweetness
ahhh
too
much
alcohol
in
the
nose
there
is
also
some
dark
fruits
and
spices
and
a
bit
of
earthy
hops
the
taste
is
medium
toastysweetroast
malt
with
some
dark
fruit
and
earthy
hops
some
alcohol
in
there
for
sure
but
it
is
tolerable
grassy
hops
on
the
palate
too
with
high
bitters
some
winter
spices
and
brown
sugar
in
here
too
mouthfeel
is
medium
body
with
low
carbonation
heat
is
too
much
for
me
here
there
is
a
decent
bitter
coat
it
needs
more
carbonation
and
cream
and
less
heat
drinkability
is
ok
the
price
is
good
for
a
strong
beer
but
the
abv
could
be
hidden
much
better
the
strong
flavors
become
a
bit
too
much
probably
not
gonna
get
it
again
but
i
actually
prefer
this
too
any
of
the
other
overly
spiced
winter
ales
i
have
had
taste
is
rich
and
full
without
being
sweet
cherry
and
raisin
notes
dominate
with
dried
fruits
more
prominent
with
exposure
feel
is
light
and
smooth
for
the
style
with
enough
carbonation
and
malt
to
mask
the
abv
yet
not
become
cloying
well
balanced
and
quite
drinkable
think
ill
stick
a
few
in

enjoy

com
d
the

may
be
a

off
putting
but
whats
in
the
bottle
is
great
to
drink
taste
is
very
nice
with
caramel
and
hops
there
is
a
nice
dose
of
hops
which
i
am
not
used
to
with
a
bock
tasting
beer
a
very
thick
bodied
beer
a
sipper
and
a
few
of
these
should
age
i
will
update
d
a

might
improve
with
some
age
on
it
to
smooth
it
out
all
in

this

good
avoid

its

something
tells
me
this
is
a
different
beer
out
of
the

vs
the
draft
version
i
am
guessing
that
i
would
like
this
more
on

one
never

a
good

lovers

for

line
they
label
this
as
a
strong
ale
but
to
me
its
a
winter
warmer
very
similar
to
anchor
christmas
in
my
opinion
a
well
crafted
beer
for
sure
this
is
the
third
beer
ive
had
from
lagunitas
and
its
starting
to
become
appearant
that
they
are
a
little
hit
or
miss
in
my
book
one
of
the
beers
was
fantastic
one
was
middle
of
the
road
and
the
last
i
just
didnt
enjoy
this
one
was
the
middle
of
the
road
d
i
bought
a
sixer
and
it
took
my
fiancee
and
i
two
weeks
to
finish
them
i
cant
say
ill
buy
another
but
i
can
see
where
other
people
may
really
enjoy
this
beer
its
just
not
for
me
and
this
is
only
one
mans
opinion
cheers
notes
not
a
favorite
from
lagunitas
which
i
agree
is
typically
underrated
and
yet
is
one
of
the
most
remarkable
us
craft
beers
available
in
this
region
but
this
hairy
eyeball
still
offers
a
nice
brew
pleasing
and
quality
note
dont
serve
this
ice
cold
once
i
waited
for
this
to
warm
up
a
little
bit
the
taste
greatly
improved
pours
a
clear
dark
amber
color
34
inch
head
of
an
offwhite
color
great
retention
and
great
lacing
smells
of
hops
yeast
sweet
malt
slight
citrus
and
slight
tart
malt
fits
the
style
of
an
american
strong
ale
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
sweet
malt
hops
slight
roasted
malt
slight
yeast
and
dark
citrus
plum
overall
a
good
blend
body
and
complexity
d
going
back
to
the
singles
store
to
locate
a
sixer
man
a
great
big
beer
that
might
be
a
regular
for
me
might
want
to
locate
the
cappuccino
stout
first
before
i
get
to
love
this
one
too
much
d
for
the
abv
its
fairly
easy
to
drink
but
it
s
not
necessarily
a
beer
i
would
look
to
try
again
one
of
the
few
lagunitas
beers
i
havent
been
too
crazy
about
d
this
is
just
a
really
good
beer
lots
of
malt
flavor
especially
chocolate
a
nice
bitter
clean
chocolate
finish
with
a
hint
of
alcohol
warmth
very
nice
on
a
cold
night
after
shoveling
some
snow
d
an
interesting
american
strong
ale
reminds
me
more
of
a
winter
warmer
like
i
stated
earlier
but
still
enjoyable
would
be
even
better
if
it
were
more
balanced
but
perhaps
this
would
benefit
from
additional
bottle
aging
drinkability
i
finished
this
one
a
little
too
quickly
though
its
almost
spring
i
could
definitely
cozy
up
to
a
few
of
these
in
the
upcoming
months
very
nice
overall
another
gem
from
the
boys
at
lagunitas
overall
impression
this
beer
is
so
good
that
my
brother
in
law
who
is
a
coors
light
drinker
was
so
scared
of
the
abv
that
he
had
to
split
one
with
me
but
he
liked
this
beer
a
lot
this
is
pretty
good
for
what
its
trying
to
be
i
wouldnt
always
be
in
the
mood
for
something
like
this
but
when
craving
something
sweeter
i
would
certainly
put
this
on
the
list
for
consideration
i
like
what
lagunitas
does
light
but
delicious
though
very
odd
indeed
a
touch
tannic
on
the
finish
and
that
detracts
from
the
overall
drinkability
dark
brown
with
a
thin
offwhite
lace
deep
sweetish
malt
spices
and
dried
fruit
aroma
with
a
little
booze
similar
in
flavor
sweetish
malts
dark
fruit
and
some
alcohol
baking
spices
and
molasses
overtones
hops
lend
balance
and
a
hint
of
pineappleripe
citrus
body
is
lighter
than
the
flavor
would
suggest
and
the
finish
cleans
up
enough
to
fall
just
short
of
cloying
at
the
back
of
the
palate
a
very
nice
beer
would
make
a
great
holiday
sipper
the
hairy
eyeball
is
a
strong
heavy
ale
with
very
little
feel
a
tad
too
much
sweetness
but
with
nice
warmth
on
a
cold
winter
day
overall
impression
probably
my
least
favorite
offering
from
lagunitas
not
an
easy
drinker
and
not
very
complex
to
the
point
that
i
enjoy
sipping
on
it
poured
a
reddish
brown
with
a
twofinger
head
that
died
slowly
and
left
some
lace
a
very
strong
malt
presence
in
the
aroma
roasted
and
sweet
along
with
some
piney
hops
a
mediumbodied
beer
that
i
had
to
sip
on
as
it
is
a
little
sticky
and
there
are
a
good
chunk
of
malts
caramel
bitter
chocolate
toffee
coffee
possibly
and
they
definitely
roasted
some
hop
presence
is
minor
but
it
gives
off
a
sour
fruit
type
taste
balanced
alright
and
passes
the
tongue
leaving
a
dry
backbite
a
good
ale
that
is
worth
trying
a
good
beer
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
a
smooth
amount
of
carbonation
alocohol
is
well
hidden
definitely
drinkeable
for
the
style
but
after
2
id
be
hard
pressed
to
handle
another
but
who
really
needs
more
than
2
of
this
style
anyway
i
did
try
this
beer
and
i
hate
it
i
will
drink
anything
and
everything
this
beer
was
just
not
my
thing
i
would
suggest
that
you
do
try
it
because
laginitas
dose
a
great
job
at
brewing
and
i
find
no
real
flaws
with
this
beer
other
than
i
dont
like
its
taste
i
read
the
reveiw
prior
and
i
think
this
guy
did
like
it
and
describe
it
correctly
ill
post
his
quote
now
caramel
burnt
sugar
golden
raisins
with
a
slowly
drying
lightly
bitter
finish
uninspiring
and
i
would
add
very
slightly
if
any
bitter
finish
out
of
balance
raisen
bomb
poop
but
im
an
ipa
lover
so
go
figure
you
decide
pours
a
hazy
dark
brown
with
less
than
a
fingers
worth
of
head
nice
ruby
highlights
smell
is
a
bit
muted
but
full
of
malts
not
much
of
a
hop
presence
very
nice
peachy
apricot
smell
expecting
a
malt
bomb
here
super
malty
and
rich
plums
and
dark
cherries
are
present
just
a
bit
of
spices
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
very
nice
mouthfeel
thick
and
creamy
it
actually
is
a
very
drinkable
am
strong
ale
goes
down
very
smooth
and
easy
very
nice
beer
alcohol
is
wellhidden
on
the
palate
but
by
the
end
becomes
evident
in
its
effect
overall
this
is
a
solid
beer
but
nothing
overly
spectacular
would
probably
pair
nicely
with
some
mild
milk
chocolate
or
a
mapleaccented
dessert
very
drinkable
givin
the
abv
but
i
wouldny
have
more
than
2
of
these
especially
if
they
were
pints
very
glad
i
tried
it
like
i
said
not
sure
there
is
anything
out
there
to
compare
this
too
its
a
really
good
beer
that
is
so
unique
i
may
just
have
to
pick
some
more
up
to
age
and
see
how
it
develops
recommend
giving
this
one
of
a
kind
beer
a
try
the
flavor
profile
is
a
bit
weak
not
really
interesting
enough
to
warrant
revisiting
maybe
i
should
have
gone
with
the
yakima
twilight
instead
d
this
tastes
good
has
an
amazing
mouthfeel
and
left
me
wanting
another
didnt
feel
or
taste
the
booze
pretty
strong
flavor
though
and
i
probably
wouldnt
want
more
than
two
in
one
sitting
i
had
a
second
draft
a
few
days
later
at
another
bar
and
took
the
same
tasting
notes
a
really
great
aftertaste
with
this
beer
fairly
easy
drinking
not
spectactular
but
solid
mouthfeel
all
the
flavors
come
and
go
then
come
again
light
biscuity
bitterness
very
drinkable
its
cheap
high
in
alcohol
low
in
presence
d
this
was
a
decent
brew
overall
but
not
one
of
lagunitas
stronger
drinkability
the
hairy
eyeball
is
very
much
a
sipper
to
me
while
i
would
not
hesitate
to
have
it
again
its
definitely
a
oneatatime
beer
to
sit
back
and
appreciate
drinkability
this
is
the
second
bottle
ive
had
of
hairy
eyeball
and
i
just
dont
get
it
i
might
have
another
bottle
but
only
if
theres
nothing
better
available
d
so
i
tried
this
again
just
now
and
tastes
noticeably
different
still
has
this
odd
hop
finish
lingers
on
the
palate
but
allinall
a
pretty
decent
brew
drinkability
it
was
an
alright
beer
a
little
on
the
sweet
end
great
ale
d
i
like
either
the
appearance
or
the
name
of
the
beer
most
the
rest
of
the
beer
is
soso
hairy
eyeball
is
a
pretty
good
strong
beer
not
as
hoppy
as
dipas
but
not
a
super
sweet
malt
bomb
either
a
nice
change
of
pace
and
a
pretty
good
winter
beer
this
is
a
big
brew
but
with
an
abv
of
8
8
its
not
out
of
control
sweet
and
savory
its
got
a
little
something
for
most
beer
lovers
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
but
strong
ales
rarely
are
another
solid
effort
from
lagunitas
another
nice
offering
from
lagunitas
well
priced
pours
a
very
dark
brown
light
head
and
lacing
smells
like
hops
and
malts
dark
fruits
creamy
and
on
the
drier
side
this
makes
a
nice
sipper
in
the
winter
there
isnt
much
to
say
about
this
one
except
for
it
totally
fits
in
the
lagunitas
lineup
d
very
drinkable
in
terms
of
hiding
its
high
alcohol
content
however
i
cant
see
myself
drinking
more
than
a
couple
in
a
sitting
a
decent
beer
but
a
bit
disappointing
from
lagunitas
drinkability
i
remember
this
one
being
alot
better
perhaps
my
palate
has
developed
since
last
year
or
perhaps
i
dont
remember
that
well
i
remember
it
being
more
like
a
classic
american
barleywine
still
a
well
masked
high
abv
and
affordable
the
alcohol
is
oh
so
well
hidden
in
this
but
after
three
bottles
i
was
feelin
nice
and
relaxed
the
mouthfeel
on
this
one
is
very
satisfying
thanks
again
lagookneetuss
taste
oh
yeah
a
creamy
malty
fruity
spicy
near
perfect
mix
overall
this
is
a
solid
beer
however
its
a
bit
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
worth
a
shot
even
more
so
if
you
enjoy
the
maltier
side
of
things
there
was
a
time
a
time
not
too
long
ago
where
a
man
in
this
case
could
stand
side
by
side
with
a
robot
and
enjoy
a
beer
together
this
was
that
beer
but
the
new
batch
of
hairy
eyeball
may
just
be
too
young
red
and
lucid
like
the
eye
of
a
robot
think
johnny
5
preelectroshock
it
appears
the
same
beer
but
the
je
ne
sais
quoi
that
once
dwelled
within
has
vanished
there
was
something
there
something
we
shared
now
it
is
gone
perhaps
only
time
can
bring
that
back
for
now
though
its
chemical
alcohol
smell
and
a
flavor
without
that
backlash
of
grassiness
make
this
perhaps
for
the
first
time
ever
a
beer
reserved
more
for
robots
sniff
than
for
me
in
the
future
i
too
will
be
robotic
and
this
will
be
my
beer
of
choice
for
i
am
a
lagunaut
d
i
loved
the
2008
vintage
and
i
drank
several
bottles
of
it
throughout
the
year
my
palate
has
changed
considerably
since
then
i
think
its
an
enjoyable
midrange
beer
best
consumed
fresh
pours
a
dark
brown
body
with
a
reddish
tint
thats
easy
to
see
through
the
head
is
maybe
the
best
part
about
this
beer
it
stick
around
for
quite
some
time
and
leaves
lots
of
nice
lacing
smells
strongly
of
alcohol
with
some
malt
hops
brown
sugariness
and
dark
fruit
taste
is
alright
for
me
a
little
overhopped
in
my
opinion
theres
some
decent
complexity
i
just
dont
love
the
taste
overall
it
was
alright
i
dont
think
ill
seek
it
out
again
d
not
so
much
perhaps
at
a
beer
tasting
or
a
festival
but
for
me
this
would
not
be
placed
into
my
collection
of
drinking
beers
so
much
as
appreciation
of
brewing
skill
beers
food
pairing
mutton
goat
or
game
but
as
a
palate
cleansing
beverage
not
a
beer
with
dinner
d
extremely
drinkable
and
extremely
delicious
alcohol
barely
noticeable
was
surprised
to
see
8
8
only
bought
a
single
bottle
will
seek
out
more
what
hurts
it
overall
is
its
lack
of
substance
and
body
nice
to
sip
and
it
would
pair
well
with
a
good
cigar
style
is
an
american
strong
ale
that
is
exactly
what
it
is
strong
there
is
not
much
hiding
the
alcohol
theres
some
great
spice
and
toasty
malts
but
the
alcohol
bite
is
present
in
the
sip
dont
let
you
believe
this
is
a
boring
or
overwhelming
beer
it
is
actually
really
interesting
and
good
the
mouthfeel
was
the
only
off
part
for
me
i
felt
it
could
have
been
more
balanced
instead
of
sweet
ive
had
this
at
least
5
times
before
tonight
and
each
time
ive
been
equally
impressed
this
beer
isnt
for
everyone
the
alcohol
isnt
hidden
well
and
the
flavor
profile
is
very
powerful
this
is
one
of
the
more
complex
beers
ive
had
just
my
opinion
aside
from
the
buttery
toffee
flavors
there
is
many
fruit
and
spice
flavors
to
round
this
one
out
taste
is
very
unique
and
overwhelming
in
a
good
way
mouthfeel
combines
silky
chewy
and
creamy
into
one
long
finish
d
this
was
almost
drinking
like
a
barleywine
to
me
maybe
my
bottle
was
a
couple
months
old
but
all
in
all
a
decent
beer
with
some
nice
complexity
to
it
maybe
its
better
a
little
older
a
12
ounce
bottle
purchased
at
oaktree
in
nj
upon
pouring
into
my
shaker
glass
the
ale
appears
a
clear
deep
brown
color
with
about
an
inch
of
tan
foam
nose
and
flavor
are
of
toffee
caramel
bitter
biting
hops
very
slight
citrus
note
medium
in
both
body
and
carbonation
with
a
lingering
bitterness
d
enjoyable
in
winter
id
say
strong
but
tasty
id
buy
another
6pack
but
i
wouldnt
drink
two
in
a
row
final
thoughts
this
is
an
interesting
change
for
lagunitas
from
the
really
hoppy
beers
its
pretty
interesting
for
a
dark
american
strong
ale
nice
dark
fruits
and
malts
touch
of
hops
a
little
sweet
however
i
could
expect
a
little
more
from
this
beer
it
just
seems
like
something
is
missing
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
reddish
brown
color
with
an
off
white
head
that
fades
to
a
sheet
of
lace
leaving
rings
around
the
glass
the
aroma
brings
loads
of
roasted
malt
and
a
bit
of
fruit
at
the
back
maybe
some
yeast
esters
the
taste
doesnt
disappoint
with
the
sweet
nearly
sticky
maltiness
and
the
fruity
flavors
this
is
a
pretty
flavorful
beer
the
alcohol
and
astringency
at
the
end
are
there
but
not
bad
for
nearly
nine
percent
great
carbonation
thanks
to
sam
the
beer
man
with
their
nice
five
beer
growler
line
up
unsure
where
the
name
came
from
expected
a
punch
in
the
face
but
is
surprisingly
sweet
and
mellow
honestly
this
was
hard
to
drink
very
malty
with
a
very
heavy
alcohol
taste
i
tried
during
memorial
day
as
a
sipper
i
would
try
others
if
i
was
new
to
the
game
if
you
want
to
start
on
a
lagunitas
brew
i
suggest
hop
stoopid
lagunitas
hairy
eyeball
is
a
redbrown
ale
with
particles
afloat
it
has
a
small
dense
sand
colored
head
that
leaves
tenacious
lacing
it
has
a
sweet
malty
aroma
with
a
grassy
note
it
has
a
smooth
medium
body
with
a
slightly
sticky
finish
its
pretty
sweet
and
resiny
its
reasonably
bittered
the
green
fruity
bitterness
shows
up
at
the
finish
and
provides
the
aftertaste
its
a
touch
heavy
for
a
session
ale
great
smell
and
a
good
looking
beer
appearance
is
very
dark
and
the
smell
malty
and
strong
caramel
notes
def
a
session
beer
with
great
caramel
feel
too
heavy
for
me
to
go
more
than
one
but
worth
trying
and
having
a
good
conversation
with
as
noted
in
previous
posts
not
much
carbonation
even
on
the
tap
pours
a
clear
red
with
2
fingers
of
dense
sticky
foam
nose
is
caramelly
malt
for
the
most
part
and
a
hint
of
floral
hops
very
malty
and
very
bitter
flavour
tons
of
dark
caramel
sugars
and
dark
fruit
and
toasty
grain
hints
of
apple
and
juicy
citrus
hops
fairly
heavy
body
but
with
a
good
deal

well
feels
quite
prickly
on
the
tongue
not
in
any
way
sessionable
lots
of
flavour
but
also
very
heavy
brew
notes
needs
more

doesnt
taste
as
good

it

the
taste
of
this
beer
isnt
really
working
for
me
flowery
hop
taste
dark
sweet
malts
little
buttery
taste
i
just
dont
care
for
the
taste
pours
a
clear
but
dense
dark
copper
color
with
2
fingers
of
rocky
creamy
light
tan
colored
head
that
never
fully
disappears
the
aroma
is
very
malty
and
heavy
with
toffee
molasses
and
a
touch
of
hops
the
flavor
is
sweet
malt
some
citrus
hops
and
finishes
very
strong
with
brown
sugar
and
a
very
noticeable
alcohol
presence
its
full
to
medium
bodied
that
is
a
touch
sticky
i
would
say
this
beer
is
a
pretty
cross
between
a
scotch
ale
and
a
malty
barleywine
overall
im
just
not
impressed
with
it
alcohol
is
a
little
too
noticeable
this
beer
pours
an
amberish
brown
nice
reddish
hues
with
a
one
finger
of
light
tannish
head
head

quickly
and
leaving
spotty

on
the
glass
nose
is
very
sweet
sugar
caramel
malts
and
some
candied
dark
fruits
taste
is
of
sweet
malts
and
sugar
at
first
very
very
sweet
beer
the
middle
is
of
dark
fruits
though
still
very
sweet
like
candied
dark
fruits
and
caramel
the
finish
leaves
a
very
sweet
aftertaste
to
it
medium
bodied
moderate
carbonation
thick
syrupy
mouthfeel
to
it
with
an
aftertaste
similar
to
when
you
eat
too
much
candy
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
for
me
the
sweetness
was
overkill
that
lowered
its
drinkability
a
solid
sweet
beer
i
must
say
that
this
is
perhaps
the
first
beer
that
i
noticed
flavors
hitting
me
in
a
particular
sequence
which
i
though
was
pretty
cool
a
very
nice
strong
ale
that
deserves
time
and
contemplation
i
could
see
myself
drinking
this
over
a
particularly
sharp
and
tactical
chess
game
d
i
would
drink
this
again
if
given
the
chance
if
it
was
just
the
fruit
adding
the
sweetness
this
would
be
a
winner
but
i
suspect
there
is
some
extra
sugar
in
there
as
well
making
this
just
too
sweet
pours
a
deep
red
with
a
sizeable
cream
color
head
that
fades
to
a
good
lace
smell
is
a
sweet
sugary
caramel
and
is
that
cheese
taste
is
immediately
sweet
malt
lot
of
sweet
malts
its
syrupy
and
really
sweet
i
think
it
tastes
more
like
a
maibock
once
you
muddle
through
the
sugar
slush
there
is
a
very
light
hop
that
quickly
becomes
alcohol
which
fades
into
the
aftertaste
its
really
just
too
sweet
for
me
mouthfeel
is
syrup
not
that
drinkable
i
love
lagunitas
but
im
not
sure
about
this
one
twistedoff
with
the
bottom
of
my
erdinger
champ
bottle
see
i
told
you
i
would
use
it
to
open
a
bottle

with
a
thick

of

a
little

like
maybe
peppercorn
or
something
like
that

the

well

this
was
a
really
good

i
plan
to
buy
more

colaesque

nice

no

cheers
d
for
such
a
high
abv
very
drinkable
although
i
dont
think
ill
be
having
again
as
this
is
very
hard
to
find
in
dfw
i
got
the
last
one
in
the
only
store
that
i
found
it
at
good
but
not
top
notch
this
particular
specimen
may
have
spent
too
long
in
the
fridge
1
month
i
say
its
one
step
away
from
being
a
barley
wine
and
that
might
be
where
it
should
be
taken
on
the
next
batch
i
would
drink
this
beer
as
one
of
my
first
choices
any
time
i
see
it
available
and
i
want
a
strong
ale

it

the

it
reminds
me
of
lemonade
and

very
malty
and
sugary
taste
tastes
almost
like
brown
sugar
in
beer
version
not
much
bitter
taste
in
the
front
but
the
aftertaste
reminds
me
of
a
barleywine
overall
a
great
beer
a
little
high
in
abv
to
drink
too
many
but
im
definitely
good
for
2
or
3
4

d
what
an
odd
and
surprisingly
awesome
beer
this
is
tasy
enough
to
drink
several
more
times
d
considering
i
enjoy
barleywines
this
is
more
drinkable
but
might
not
be
so
approachable
for
everyone
d
this
is
a
good
winter
style
reminds
me
of
an
americanized
dubbel
overall
i
enjoyed
it
on
a
nice
70
degree
day
after
dinner
but
i
think
it
would
be
better
at
about
20
degrees
on
an
autumn
or
winter
day
does
every
beer
this
brewery
put
out
taste
so
good
decent
beer
dont
know
that
id
seek
it
out
in
the
future
california
is
without
doubt
the
most
competitive
of
american
states
as
far
as
craft
breweries
go
of
all
its
many
great
micros
i
have
no
reservations
about
calling
lagunitas
one
of
my
favourites
they
not
only
have
a
charming
attitude
towards
work
and
life
as
illustrated
in
their
hilarious
write
ups
and
company
mentality
but
a
kickass
lineup
of
beer
to
boot
lagunitas
dont
stop
what
youre
doing
because
i
dont
ever
want
to
stop
drinking
it
d
nice
offer
to
try
easy
to
drink
the
alcohol
is
noticable
but
not
overbearing
in
the
least
ill
be
looking
for
this
one
in
the
future
pretty
heavy
body
but
a
pretty
smooth
drinker
d
nice
beer
couldnt
drink
all
night
but
is
a
great
winter
time
beer
d
not
bad
but
would
like
more
flavors
perhaps
more
spices
blipped

kid
by
tom
waits
this
beer
poured
a
dark
red
with
purple
highlights
and
a
singlefinger
head
the
smell
is
a
mix
of
many
different
things
including
toasted
malt
at
least
a
couple
kinds
of
hops
dark
fruit
molasses
and
alcohol
the
taste
starts
off
with
a
sweet
candylike
malt
that
reminds
me
of
a
belgian
tripel
that
gives
way
to
some
grassy
then
citrusy
hops
that
balance
it
out
very
well
this
is
a
beer
that
deals
in
extremes
while
remaining
very
tasty
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
thick
with
a
little
slickness
and
warming
from
the
alcohol
with
mild
carbonation
this
beer
is
surprisingly
drinkable
for
a
high
abv
beer
with
a
fair
amount
of
hops
great
beer
everyone
should
try
it
at
least
once
d
its
rich
and
a
bit
heavy
not
to
mention
sweet
but
that
doesnt
mean
you
cant
drink
a
few

dont
know
that

more

however
the
smart
money
is
still
on

the

as
in
the
nose
half

bbcsd0903patrick
d
eh
i
dont
know
on
this
one
lots
of
interesting
flavors
and
my
tongue
and
head
just
dont
know
where
to
go
on
this
one
i
could
maybe
drink
a
second
but
definitely
not
a
third
quite
an
interesting
beer
lots
and
lots
of
things
going
on
id
recommend
this
to
anybody
that
likes
dopplebocks
and
scottish
ales
i
definitely
enjoyed
this
beer
id
have
no
problem
drinking
another
one
or
two
d
this
is
a
decent
easy
to
drink
beer
different
than
what
i
expected
but
definitely
worth
a
try
overall
a
very
solid
beer
with
a
tight
flavor
profile
the
rich
malts
dominated
everything
through
enough
hops
shone
through
to
provide
a
nice
balance
to
it
reminded
me
of
bigfoot
12oz
bottle
into
a
lucifer
tulip
pours
a
crisp
brown
with
a
decent
khaki
head
that
diminishes
to
a
thin
layer
and
leaves
slight
lacing
aroma
is
burnt
caramel
dried
fruit
and
a
hint
of
wood
the
taste
is
a
strange
blend
of
caramel
brown
sugar
and
dried
fruits
that
gives
way
to
a
balanced
taste
of
pine
hops
and
caramel
malts
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
with
smooth
carbonation
and
some
warming
alcohol
that
shows
in
the
finish
this
is
certainly
an
interesting
beer
but
i
was
hoping
for
something
better
very
drinkable
with
a
nice
mouthfeel
extremely
impressive
for
a
8
8
abv
beer
d
drinkable
for
8
abv
beer
doesnt
disguise
it
nice
malt
characters
and
hop
balance
not
overly
complex
nicely
balanced
the
drink
is
fullishmedium
in
body
with
an
excellent
sizzle
of
fine
carbonation
though
hairy
eyeball
is
quite
potent
at
8
7
abv
it
remains
pretty
mild
in
flavor
with
admirable
alcohol
suppression
that
leaves
the
beer
plenty
drinkable
as
the
alcohol
rises
the
drinkability
starts
to
lower
but
this
still
works
fine
just
a
slower
sipping
beer
taste
is
not
quite
as
gummy
as
the
nose
but
it
is
still
there
residual
sugar
sweetness
is
actually
a
good
thing
in
this
beer
as
it
helps
keep
the
high
alcohol
and
what
seem
to
be
high
aa
hops
in
check
body
is
full
almost
syrupy
but
oh
so
easy
to
drink
this
one
is
a
beer
geeks
wet
dream
definitely
recommended
dnot
a
great
one
in
my
book
and
seemed
to
overall
lack
a
sense
of
balance
and
what
flavors
are
supposed
to
be
accentuated
d
reasonably
drinkable
for
what
it
is
nice
mocha

complex
but

well

the
taste
is
no
where
near
that
close
big
use
of
malt
hides
the
hops
in
this
one
its
more
drinkable
than
it
should
be
not
heavy
at
all
yet
still
very
flavorful
it
compares
very
favorably
to
arrogant
or
double
bastard
if
that
is
your
thing
i
would
say
its
as
drinkable
as
either
and
honestly
better
than
notes
this
is
the
one
and
only
time
that
i
bought
a
case
of
any
beer
since
i
really
started
getting
into
finding
and
rating
a
lot
of
different
beers
i
did
so
since
last
year
i
was
so
impressed
with
this
one
and
i
went
back
to
the
same
store
world
wines
and
liquor
in
mentor
to
discover
that
it
is
a
seasonal
i
was
not
going
to
let
that
happen
again
also
it
was
an
early
not
the
first
craft
beer
that
really
turned
me
on
to
the
scene
really
though
this
is
a
great
beer
notes
in
summary
this
is
a
good
beer
thats
a
bit
too
sweet
even
for
my
sweet
tooth
again
if
i
were
rating
this
as
a
barleywine
it
would
rate
higher
as
it
is
i
love
this
beer
its
worth
searching
out
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
im
glad
i
picked
it
up
on
a
whim
definitely
one
that
is
worth
a
try
i
probably
wont
be
buying
it
again
anytime
soon
though
because
while
it
wasnt
bad
it
didnt
impress
me
that
much
either
d
this
one
is
definitely
a
sipper
but
it
does
drink
pretty
good
for
a
beer
of
its
strength
overall
hairy
eyeball
is
is
pretty
solid
beer
that
i
would
definitely
purchase
again
recommneded
d
would
struggle
to
drink
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
row
but
liked
it
none
the
less
a
little
too
sweetnot
hoppy
enough
for
me
although
my
favorite
style
is
a
iipa
so
go
figure
a
heavyflavored
beer
with
some
alcohol
punch
not
exactly
something
id
doubledown
on
very
tasty
but
a
one
is
enough
per
sitting
type
of
brew
i
enjoyed
it
and
would
seek
it
for
a
return
to
the
style
price
is
right
2
15
for
a
1
oz
single
it
pours
a
nice
mahogany
color
in
the
glass
with
light
brown
foam
and
plenty
of
lacing
on
the
glass
slightly
nutty
aroma
the
flavor
is
far
more
substatial
than
the
aroma
and
has
plenty
of
nut
malt
goodness
with
a
brown
sugar
sweetness
this
one
is
definately
malt
dominated
but
finishes
with
a
slightly
earthy
grassy
hops
really
liked
the
warm
blend
of
flavors
here
some
heft
in
the
mouthfeel
from
all
that
malt
very
smooth
and
drinkable
beer
especially
if
you
dont
mind
all
the
sweetness
d
i
like
this
d
this
is
a
unique
beer
but
not
one
i
could
ever
drink
more
than
12
of
in
a
sitting
would
appeal
to
those
who
like
very
sweet
beers
very
nice
texture
on
this
medium
heavy
bodied
beer
feels
great
in
the
mouth
with
just
enough
carbonation
to
tickle
the
taste
buds
but
not
ruin
the
creamy
texture
of
the
beer
the
alcohol
is
fairly
well
hidden
only
detected
in
the
mild
warming
sensation
it
imparts
i
first
tried
this
beer
at
a
beerfest
a
couple
weeks
ago
and
really
enjoyed
it
so
when
i
saw
a
6pack
at
my
local
beer
store
i
couldnt
resist
it
tastes
every
bit
as
good
as
i
remember
a
very
nice
strong
ale
i
would
definitely
enjoy
drinking
many
more
of
pours
a
little
thin
and
not
much
head
a
little
murky
and
plain
brown
smell
is
sweet
with
just
a
little
funk
definately
not
overpowering
but
noticeable
taste
is
also
sweet
malty
with
alittle
brett
funk
and
sugar
good
finish
and
is
sweet
and
hides
the
high
alcohol
mouthfeel
is
decent
fairly
smooth
nothing
special
is
pretty
drinkable
and
decent
all
around
nothing
amazing
for
this
style
but
pretty
good
and
worth
the
money
to
try
sweet
and
a
different
than
most
other
american
wilds
i
have
had
just
not
too
special
d
not
really
my
cup
of
tea
pretty
subtle
in
aroma
and
flavor
overall
not
bad
per
se
but
just
not
a
style
that
appeals
to
me
compared
to
a
dipa
imperial
stout
or
even
a
good
old
fashioned
pilsner
verdict
hairy
eyeball
is
somewhat
similar
to
brown
shugga
but
certainly
different
enough
to
warrant
its
existence
perfect
for
a
cold
and
drizzly
day
like
today
ill
be
aging
a
couple
of
bottles
next
to
the
bottles
of
brown
shugga
to
see
how
it
evolves
lagunitas
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
not
only
are
their
beers
all
delicious
and
consistent
but
they
are
all
high
abv
and
well
priced
too
usually
like
8
99
or
9
99
a
6
pack
or
3
99
a
bomber
this
beer
is
no
exception
pours
a
nice
dark
redbrown
tons
of
lacing
and
good
head
retention
sexy
on
the
light
bodied
side
very
sweet
taste
to
it
sort
of
took
me
by
surprise
but
it
had
a
nice
mouthfeel
to
it
very
hoppy
but
well
balanced
with
the
sweetness
some
alcohol
taste
kicks
in
at
the
end
but
it
has
a
nice
warming
appeal
to
it
the
sweetness
was
a
tad
bit
too
present
for
me
but
other
than
that
this
is
a
great
beer
heres
lookin
atcha
that
being
said
it
is
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
dark
amberbrown
pour
fruity
bready
malty
smell
with
caramel
again
think
bock
the
flavors
are
very
malty
with
caramel
and
a
colalike
taste
raisins
and
only
a
trace
of
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
medium
bodied
with
a
fullmouthed
presence
again
its
very
similar
to
say
an
eisbock
or
perhaps
a
darker
scotch
ale
definitely
good
but
nothing
unique
all
in
all
pretty
dang
drinkable
for
a
strong
ale
a
bit
syrupysweet
on
the
whole
but
thats
not
necessarily
bad
i
wouldnt
want
to
drink
more
than
one
or
two
but
im
sure
i
could
kind
of
reminds
me
of
brown
sugga
but
with
a
bit
more
hops
a
bit
more
sweetness
and
a
bit
more
strong
nothing
really
amazing
but
an
allround
impressive
strong
ale
a
good
american
strong
ale
for
a
cold
night
pours
out
a
dark
brown
that
isnt
completely
opaque
with
a
small
white
head
minimal
lacing
smell
is
kinda
metallic
more
than
anything
first
taste
is
of
the
chocolateish
malts
hardly
any
hop
bite
at
the
end
definatly
a
sweet
beer
mouthfell
makes
this
a
good
drinker
alchol
isnt
overpowering
and
carbonation
is
just
right
not
one
of
my
favorates
its
just
to
malty
for
me
i
did
save
one
for
aging
purposes
and
will
compare
it
to
next
years
batch
d
another
plus
on
the
list
of
beers
for
me
lagunitas
makes
another
tasty
and
voluptuous
brew
also
almost
9
in
the
firewater
category
i
would
not
believe
it
for
a
second
this
is
very
tame
this
a
great
brew
a
perfect
choice
for
a
cold
weather
sipper
another
top
notch
brew
from
the
folks
at
lagunitas
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
some
cherry
red
hues
the
small
tan
head
fades
fast
and
leaves
a
couple
of
small
fingers
of
lace
sticking
out
notes
of
burnt
sugar
tree
bark
pine
resin
and
dark
fruits
plums
prunes
grapes
rise
to
the
nose
a
vinegary
essence
is
noticed
as
well
tastes
sweet
and
sugary
but
not
cloying
theres
a
good
hop
bite
mixed
in
along
with
some
more
dark
fruits
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
creamy
at
first
with
some
dryness
working
itself
in
over
time
it
lies
just
between
medium
and
heavy
a
slight
shake
foments
a
small
and
quick
bubble
blast
indicating
a
low
level
of
carbonation
the
alcohol
becomes
more
evident
as
the
drink
warms
this
is
kind
of
like
a
subdued
barleywine
and
it
has
a
really
cool
name
all
in
all
id
say
its
a
damn
good
drink
d
it
drinks
well
though
i
would
not
have
more
than
2
or
3
it
fills
you
up
for
sure
overall
pretty
good
pours
a
clear
copper
color
with
two
fingers
of
tan
head
that
had
good
retention
moderate
amount
of
sticky
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
figs
and
prunes
is
what
i
get
from
the
aroma
some
alcohol
is
also
detected
very
malty
charactor
in
the
flavor
dark
fruits
again
especially
figs
comes
to
mind
sort
of
a
sticky
sweet
aftertaste
and
the
alcohol
is
barely
noticed
a
tad
overcarbonated
but
otherwise
a
nice
body
nice
flavors
but
something
i
would
grow
tired
of
after
one
maybe
two
bottles
the
high
abv
does
not
help
drinkability
this
poured
a
clear
dark
cherry
color
with
tan
head
it
smelled
like
raisin
and
prune
with
brown
sugar
earthy
whole
wheat
and
a
bit
of
sweet
chocolate
it
tasted
like
fresh
barley
and
oak
with
some
wild
yeast
and
a
bit
of
semisweet
chocolate
and
sour
cherries
and
alcohol
it
was
quite
thick
with
some
carbonation
and
had
a
lasting
bittersweet
aftertaste
overall
this
had
a
nice
malty
scent
and
a
clean
flavor
but
wasnt
as
sweet
as
expected
perhaps
it
would
sweeten
with
age
the
wildsour
flavors
also
didnt
seem
to
fit
it
had
a
very
nice
full
body
and
was
fairly
easy
to
drink
despite
some
alcohol
being
noticeable
i
enjoy
this
beer
but
there
is
certainly
room
for
improvement
a
nice
beer
year
after
year
from
a
local
brewery
d
not
sure
what
to
thin
of
this
but
i
have
to
say
there
are
lot
of
better
offerings
in
this
style
and
by
this
brewer
overall
this
is
a
bold
beer
that
has
a
lot
going
on
lots
of
big
flavors
that
make
you
want
more
nice
this
is
almost
like
a
really
high
octane
english
barleywine
with
an
unusual
yeast
being
used
not
bad
enjoyable
but
a
bit
standard
worth
a
try
though
overall
this
is
a
really
good
ale
drinkability
probably
a
little
more
drinkable
than
the
average
strong
ale
due
to
the
light
mouthfeel
i
wouldnt
drink
more
than
2
in
a
sitting
d
im
pretty
impressed
with
this
quite
complex
and
definitely
delicious
for
its
high
alcohol
content
it
drinks
nicely
ill
look
for
this
one
earlier
next
year
very
appealing
the
taste
has
a
bit
of
an
abv
throaty
burn
but
not
bad
at
all
for
an
8
8
beer
the
taste
has
the
berry
sweetness
indicative
of
the
nose
there
is
some
hop
punch
in
the
beer
there
are
some
barleywine
qualities
in
the
beer
it
is
pretty
full
bodied
a
tad
syrupy
pretty
low
carbonation
a
bit
sweet
and
sticky
a
touch
cloying
but
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
the
beer
has
a
sweet
liqueur
quality
to
it
in
the
best
sense
without
the
alcohol
harshness
although
there
is
plenty
of
abv
in
the
beer
that
is
more
warming
than
anything
else
overall
the
beer
is
quite
complex
and
enjoyable
good
drinkability
but
could
have
been
bigger
and
i
wouldve
liked
to
taste
a
bit
more
alcohol
in
this
one
a
solid
brew
nonetheless
d
with
the
8
8
abv
i
cant
drink
more
than
a
few
of
these
in
a
sitting
but
its
not
a
bad
beer
drinkability
a
solid
strong
ale
from
lagunitas
especially
at
around
910
a
sickpack
you
can
make
this
one
last
over
a
long
snifter
session
i
wish
it
packed
more
of
a
punch
overall
and
even
though
i
dont
smoke
cigars
for
some
reason
i
imagine
this
is
one
that
would
go
well
with
one
and
not
only
that
its
warm
out
right
now
in
february
in
richmond
and
the
beer
is
drinking
just
fine
that
adds
some
points
since
most
would
be
reserved
at
least
for
me
for
winter
tasty
pretty
darn
drinkable
dangerously
so
in
fact
abv
contributes
a
bit
to
the
taste
but
it
very
well
hidden
nonetheless
thin
film
of
head
disappears
quickly
over
a
brown
body
with
copper
and
amber
highlights
smells
of
roasted
dark
malts
very
sweet
and
pleasant
fruits
with
the
slightest
alcohol
coming
through
tastes
of
malts
and
hops
balanced
so
perfectly
flavors
of
nut
and
chocolate
make
me
wonder
if
this
beer
is
the
spawn
of
a
porter
and
a
brown
ale
only
the
tiniest
bit
of
sour
and
alcohol
pulls
through
each
sip
the
mouthfeel
is
what
is
unattractive
for
me
medium
carbonation
is
just
fine
but
the
beer
itself
is
light
water
and
even
thin
an
exceptionally
easy
beer
to
drink
overallits
like
the
nearly
9
alcohol
stayed
in
the
bottle
during
the
pour
id
recommend
arrogant
bastard
over
this
one
in
the
category
but
im
pleased
with
this
lagunitas
release
its
perfect
for
a
rainy
night
mouthfeel
is

overall
a

i
enjoy
better

esr
still
a
good

at

d
not
good
for

session

very

for
a

a

for

another
solid
brew
from
lagunitas
that
comes
at
a
terrific
value
8

pack
i
am
a
fan
of
lagunitas
but
have
reservations
about
beer
with
high
abv
this
beer
drinks
very
smooth
and
has
a
great
brown
sugar
and
molasses
taste
to
it
abv
is
not
prevalent
could
drink
a
couple
of
these
with
no
problems
i
did
not
get
much
aroma
from
the
beer
which
was
a
little
suprising
overall
would
probably
buy
it
again
d
despite
a
very
wellmasked
abv
drinkability
suffers
due
to
it
being
a
rather
uninspiring
beer
notes
just
like
lagunitas
not
a
lot
of
anything
here
its
like
they
are
too
afraid
of
putting
too
much
flavor
in
their
beers
further
evidence
that
lagunitas
is
overrated
all
and
all
a
superb
brew
thanks
scott
i
will
be
very
honest
i
did
not
really
enjoy
this
beer
appearance
is
good
nice
deep
brown
color
with
a
little
head
and
no
lacing
smell
is
okay
with
lots
of
dried
dark
fruit
right
up
front
a
bit
of
hops
and
way
too
much
alcohol
for
8
80
in
my
opinion
taste
is
more
of
the
same
but
something
doesnt
mix
well
here
it
goes
sour
and
not
in
a
good
way
mouthfeel
is
decent
slightly
above
medium
body
drinkability
is
not
that
good
the
flavors
are
a
bit
rough
but
the
mouthfeel
is
fantastic
i
believe
a
little
age
on
this
would
do
it
alot
of
good
so
lets
see
what
6
months
gives
us
overall
all
in
all
this
is
a
good
unique
brew
the
flavors
blend
together
almost
a
little
too
much
and
it
becomes
somewhat
muddled
that
and
it
has
the
slight
metallic
aftertaste
otherwise
this
is
another
solid
effort
from
lagunitas

this
wasnt
a
bad
beer
but
it
just
seemed
really
boring
to
me
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
drinkability
a
bit
too
sweet
and
a
bit
too
coarse
though
it
fits
the
name

have
here

kind

like
it

and
other
ies
taste
is
like
cola
with
a
crisp
note
that
cuts
through
the
sweet
that
dominates
it
surprisingly
balanced
maybe
attributable
to
the
hops
that
accompany
an
american
style
definitions
hops
definitely
come
on
in

aftertaste
the
mouthfeel

for
the
cold

drinkability
is

this
is
a

beer
one
i
dont

i
could
put
down
a
lot
of
not
a
knock

after

11

i
tried
another
from
the

the
alcohol
has
mellowed
considerably
and
a

is
far
more
apparent
the
comparison
to
a

still
stands
and

are

the

about
the

up
my
alley
more

more

that
being

up
there
so
be

and
id

giving
it
a
shot
at

once
bottle
courtesy
of
secret

poured
a
deep
dark
brown
color
ale
with
an
average
foamy
head
with
average
retention
and
no
lacing
aroma
of
big
caramel
malt
is
quite
imposing
and
dominating
taste
is
also
dominated
by
some
heavy
caramel
malt
with
some
notes
of
bitter
hops
lacking
some
floral
or
citrus
notes
with
not
as
much
hops
as
i
was
expecting
considering
the
brewery
full
body
with
average
carbonation
and
no
discernable
alcohol
this
one
was
a
bit
of
a
surprise
considering
the
lack
of
hops
yes
there
is
a
lot
but
not
as
much
as
i
would
expect
from
lagunitas
but
the
malt
was
very
efficient
the
body
is
full
yet
goes
down
well
this
is
a
damn
good
brew
whatever
it
is
up
there
with
old
gnarly
d
pretty
good
i
could
drink
the
whole
thing
and
although
there
was
some
alcohol
present
it
didnt
feel
like
9
abv
beer
interesting
id
definitely
revisit
alcohol
is
very
nicely
concealed
too
drinkable
for
such
a
strong
ale
pours
a
deep
mahogany
brown
with
a
modest
head
which
dissipates
quickly
leaving
a
light
lacing
in
my
snifter
a
strong
smell
cereal
grains
dark
fruits
caramels
alcohol
and
licorice
a
touch
of
hops
and
smoke
detected
as
well
a
rich
sweet
malty
flavor
full
of
nuts
dates
and
fig
well
balanced
with
hop
bitterness
a
full
bodied
brew
with
moderate
carbonation
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
pretty
drinkable
for
a
9
abv
d
d
malty
and
slightly
boozy
making
it
a
bit
cloying
hard
to
have
more
than
1
in
a
sitting
reminds
me
of
a
milder
version
of
brown
shugga
not
as
spicy
as
i
remember
from
the
bottle
but
still
very
complex
and
tasty
not
to
mention
quite
large
recommended
overall
a
superb
brew
with
some
kick
highly
recommened
for

you
dont
feel
the
alcohol
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
an
impressive
reddish
brown
with
some
serioud
head
that
leaves
some
thick
fat
lace
on
the
glass
smell
is
very
sweet
with
hints
of
raison
and
maple
in
there
also
a
bit
of
sweet
molasses
taste
is
pretty
awesome
of
raison
with
malt
backbone
and
a
bit
of
a
hop
bitterness
this
is
pretty
awesome
stuff
and
rivals
what
some
of
the
other
big
players
are
doing
out
their
for
their
strong
ales
in
my
book
simply
put
awesome
stuff
oelergud
i
love
the
name
of
this
beer
its
great
should
have
been
the
name
of
their
double
ipa
though
but
i
digress
poured
a
nice
dark
reddish
brown
with
a
wee
head
the
nose
was
refreshing
with
sweet
milk
chocolate
notes
and
a
hint
of
citrus
the
taste
was
equally
malty
but
balanced
well
with
the
hops
and
fairly
smooth
on
the
palate
it
was
warming
but
you
dont
notice
the
hefty
abv
too
much
in
the
taste
this
beer
is
big
bodied
and
definitely
a
sipper
the
more
it
warms
and
the
more
it
warms
me
up
i
can
really
start
to
appreciate
it
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
or
the
newly
converted
done
per
sitting
is
all
id
recommend
maybe
two
if
youre
brave
very
enjoyable
beer
slightly
deceptive
in
terms
of
potency
this
beer
seems
like
you
could
have
severalthe
flavor
seems
innocent
enough
i
bought
this
bottle
as
a
12oz
single
at
3
cellars
in
franklin
wi
pours
a
dark
brown
the
smell
is
malty
and
earthy
the
taste
had
a
lot
of
sweetness
in
it
caramel
all
over
the
place
to
me
its
maybe
on
the
verge
of
being
cloying
what
this
reminded
me
of
is
leffe
brown
which
is
way
too
sweet
almost
sugary
for
me
the
malt
predominates
big
time
in
this
beer
i
probably
wouldnt
get
it
again
although
maybe
i
can
see
a
beer
with
this
sort
of
taste
being
ok
in
certain
situations
ie
maybe
some
sort
of
food
pairing
needs
more
hop
to
balance
out
such
a
brew
seems
almost
like
a
sweet
dobble
bock
nothing
hairy
about
this
brew
the
9
is
not
to
be
felt
but
by
midbottle
the
sweetness
settles
or
is
less
noticeable
d
this
is
a
mindblowing
brew
its
extremely
complex
and
tasty
and
could
serve
as
an
excellent
sipper
or
a
semisessionable
brew
for
a
short
session
at
home
when
no
driving
is
necessary
when
i
first
heard
the
name
i
immediately
associated
a
hairy
eyeball
with
a
ball
sack
or
single
nut
but
then
i
realized
that
hairy
eyeball
probably
refers
to
the
blood
shot
state
of
inebriation
that
could
be
attained
by
drinking
more
than
one
of
these
bad
mofos
overall
enjoyable
enough
carbonation
that
it
wasnt
too
syrupy
wouldve
made
a
good
session
beer
if
it
werent
for
the
high
abv
but
i
enjoyed
sipping
this
over
an
hour
or
so
really
nice
and
full
body
tasty
but
not
in
my
top
3
lagunitas
tastes
like
a
boozy
slightly
hoppy
version
of
a
brown
ale
as
the
last
beer
of
a
long
night
it
was
perfect
after
getting
off
work
its
a
little
too
sweet
and
boozy
for
a
session
beer
however
so
i
opted
to
head
home
after
polishing
off
my
pint
of
this
id
drink
it
again
but
not
more
than
one
pint
at
a
sitting
the
follically
gifted
optical
anatomy
pours
a
deep
clear
ruby
red
with
big
bubbled
off
white
head
smell
is
of
maltiness
with
some
clean
sort
of
floral
hop
taste
follows
predominantly
malty
but
a
noticeable
spicy
hop
presence
but
not
very
bitter
the
brew
is
a
good
balance
but
to
me
it
is
kind
of
boring
the
flavor
is
nice
and
rich
but
there
is
not
alot
of
complexity
here
mouthfeel
is
good
and
viscous
drinkability
is
very
good
for
a
9
brew
a
good
one
threw
one
in
the
cellar
just
to
see
what
happens
good
beer
but
nothing
worth
seeking
out
drinkability
quite
easy
drinking
despite
the
abv
overall
a
very
well
put
together
strong
ale
although
a
little
more
complexity
would
be
nice
i
very
much
enjoyed
this
beer
and
will
definitely
drink
again
and
recommend
it
to
anyone
smooth
juicy
and
clean
with
very
fine
carbonation
plenty
of
warmth
and
a
mild
dryness
in
the
finish
medium
bodied
throughout
a
nice
selection
and
one
of
the
better
strong
ales
ive
had
in
quite
some
time
drinkability
is
pretty
good
this
is
a
tasty
and
interesting
beer
but
its
a
bit
much
to
be
more
than
a
one
and
done
but
with
that
said
the
one
glass
was
well
worth
trying
not
bad
i
am
not
sure
id
go
out
of
my
way
to
buy
another
sixer
hard
to
classify
this
beer
american
brown
ale
i
really
enjoy
all
the
lagunitas
beers
but
this
one
did
not
really
stand
out
for
anything
in
particular
at
9
it
is
a
monster
so
it
is
not
really
a
session
beer
and
i
am
not
sure
i
would
want
to
spend
some
of
my
soberness
on
this
beer
pours
a
clear
brown
to
maroon
color
with
a
large
creamy
tan
head
that
lasts
a
bit
looks
quite
nice
in
the
glass
smell
is
bright
and
fruity
and
delicious
sweet
malt
up
front
body
is
semi
creamy
with
flavors
of
sticky
malt
light
alcohol
and
a
slick
mouthfeel
and
a
complementing
moderate
hop
bitterness
kind
of
a
dark
toffee
toasty
hopped
maltiness
and
i
thought
it
was
pretty
good
and
very
drinkable
for
9
nice
beer
great
sweet
malty
goodness
decent
alcohol
burn
nice
balance
not
overly
hoppy
good
session
beer
nice
head
but
not
foamy
no
aftertaste
to
speak
of
best
served
on
the
warm
side
good
with
salami
and
cheese
could
have
used
slightly
more
carbonation
to
bring
up
the
scores
in
appearance
smell
and
mouthfeel
taste
was
excellent
not
a
treat
not
a
utility
beer
reserve
for
good
friends
and
pathetic
souls
who
have
never
had
a
really
good
beer
overall
i
enjoy
the
hop
forward
brews
lagunitas
puts
out
this
is
not
one
of
my
favorites
and
one
i
will
most
likely
pass
on
in
the
future
d
this
beer
has
a
nice
big
malt
profile
that
is
not
too
sweet
and
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
this
makes
a
great
sipper
but
it
really
catches
up
to
you
with
the
8
abv
drinkability
is
pretty
high
a
smooth
and
simple
stronger
ale
with
a
clean
profile
and
high
digestibility
still
its
pretty
sugary
and
with
the
higher
abv
i
doubt
id
enjoy
more
then
2
or
3
of
these
overall
it
is
a
nicely
drinkable
beer
the
candy
sweetness
and
minty
hops
are
not
quite
my
preference
but
it
is
certainly
quaffable
worth
a
try
but
not
my
first
choice
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
would
probably
only
drink
one
or
two
due
to
the
richness
of
the
brew
all
in
all
an
odd
juxtaposition
of
light
and
refreshing
and
bursts
of
intensity
drinkable
but
not
too
memorable
tried
this
for
4
75
at
four
moon
tavern
in
chicago
overall
a
nice
strong
ale
not
the
best
from
lagunitas
but
well
worth
drinking
d
hard
to
finish
the
rest
of
the
6
pack
is
going
in
the
cellar
hopefully
it
gows
to
meet
its
reputation
really
quite
delicious
a
very
enjoyable
strong
ale
that
masks
the
high
abv
8
8
very
well
excellent
d
a
little
strong
for
too
many
but
its
deceptive
very
good
beer
all
around
i
love
this
brewery
this
strong
ale
is
very
easy
to
drink
almost
too
easy
ill
definitely
have
again
overall
very
drinkable
and
no
idea
about
the
8
8
dark
brown
color
with
a
nice
creamy
tan
head
that
lingers
enjoyable
aroma
of
malts
caramel
and
hops
enjoyable
taste
similar
to
the
smell
but
with
some
nuts
and
spices
in
there
nothing
overpowering
nicely
balanced
and
not
too
complex
a
very
rich
beer
and
well
worth
trying
goes
down
rather
smooth
and
nicely
and
despite
the
strong
abv
its
really
quite
drinkable
fullbodied
and
evenly
carbonated
but
a
touch
slick
on
the
finish
otherwise
just
fine
highly
drinkable
ale
and
it
seems
to
have
something
to
appeal
to
both
hopheads
and
maltfiends
alike
check
that
the
booze
really
sneaks
up
on
you
and
could
easily
render
you
silly
if
not
careful
down
goes
the
drinkability
no
room
for
head
on
the
heavy
pour
from
the
bar
great
lacing
opaque
brew
dark
amber
body
knocking
points
off
smell
here
as
i
was
getting
a
low
to
no
smell
taste
is
where
this
one
wins
sweet
and
hoppy
almost
double
ipa
flavors
carbonation
on
the
tongue
is
mild
but
noticeable
excellent
balance
of
malts
and
hops
full
body
beer
good
mouth
fill
a
good
session
beer
for
me
strong
ale
is
the
correct
description
strange
name
bottle
does
not
give
a
clue
as
to
the
type
of
beer
tastes
linger
including
hoppiness
a
little
caramel
aftertaste
pleasant
mouthfeel
aftertaste
also
stays
in
the
mouth
and
on
the
tonue
pleasant
look
i
had
a
lumpy
gravy
last
night
and
thought
that
would
be
similar
to
the
flavors
of
this
beer
at
9
49sixer
this
is
a
good
value
for
a
well
done
american
strong
d
no
idea
what
to
make
of
this
other
than
a
wonderfully
tasty
beer
and
another
score
from
lagunitas
d
not
an
everyday
beer
but
one
i
would
not
turn
down
if
given
the
chance
recommended
d
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
a
tastey
brew
overall
not
a
sessionable
one
for
me
though
i
could
not
drink
too
many
of
this
beer
probably
only
one
actually
it
is
far
too
sugary
and
the
caramel
is
overpowering
considering
caramel
is
not
my
favorite
flavor
this
is
understandable
others
might
feel
differently
d
not
interested
in
having
any
more
of
these
a
bit
of
a
let
down
the
alcohol
showed
up
more
as
the
beer
went
down
d
only
the
strength
of
this
beer
would
stop
me
from
drinking
this
all
night
sweet
and
smooth
are
the
two
main
flavors
here
there
is
a
slight
hop
to
the
aftertaste
but
is
very
barely
detectable
that
is
until
you
drink
more
the
hops
tend
to
build
the
more
your
drink
it
as
far
as
the
aftertaste
goes
all
in
all
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
at
9abv
its
definitely
a
keeper
another
great
offering
from
lagunitas
i
seem
to
look
forward
to
each
of
their
seasonal
releases
as
they
are
all
very
tasty
the
one
starts
off
with
a
nice
deep
mahogany
color
with
a
tan
head
the
lacing
is
great
not
any
hop
smell
and
it
is
definately
a
warming
drink
halfway
through
the
glass
my
stomach
is
feeling
toasty
this
beer
is
similiar
to
my
favorite
offering
of
lagunitas
brown
shugga
it
just
seems
a
bit
lighter
and
less
sweet
both
have
a
remarkable
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
given
their
abv
well
done
lagunitas
this
is
a
pretty
tasty
brew
its
quite
potent
and
meaty
i
would
buy
this
again
a
fine
american
style
barleywinestrong
ale
it
would
probably
cellar
really
well
overall
not
bad
but
i
dont
see
myself
having
more
than
1
of
these
due
to
the
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
the
beer
poured
a
light
rubyred
with
a
creamy
half
inch
head
into
a
12oz
pilsner
glass
there
was
a
slight
scent
of
fruity
malt
but
no
discernable
hop
aroma
the
taste
was
a
fairly
nice
balance
between
the
malt
hops
and
alcohol
with
the
hop
bitterness
winning
out
in
the
end
nice
carbonation
and
lacing
with
a
coating
of
sweet
malt
residue
in
my
mouth
after
every
swallow
tasty
drinkablity
interesting
and
unique
beer
not
as
over
the
top
as
i
expected
the
hairy
eyeball
is
more
interesting
than
my
palate
can
pick
out
i
have
some
of
last
years
in
the
cellar
i
must
give
one
a
try
pretty
soon
a
solid
strong
ale
just
a
little
too
sweet
to
have
more
than
1
in
a
sitting
a
good
value
for
the
price
alcohol
harshness
has
subsided
rich
caramel
flavor
no
hops
overall
a
very
good
candidate
for
aging
overall
an
excellent
choice
in
the
lagunitas
lineup
sure
i
prefer
unibroues
various
takes
on
the
strong
ale
but
theyre
also
quite
a
bit
more
expensive
seems
to
fit
well
with
lagunitas
position
as
a
brewery
not
necessarily
the
best
but
you
get
a
lot
for
the
money
tasty
beer
one
i
should
have
tried
long
ago
but
kept
passing
up
dammed
if
im
not
kicking
myself
now
defiantly
worth
picking
up
the
single
ill
have
to
get
a
sixer
next
time
really
really
drinkable
for
a
9
beer
huge
body
a
little
more
balanceage
would
help
better
than
i
would
have
thought
based
on
my
initial
impressions
from
the
bottle
but
it
could
be
better
id
try
it
again
this
is
another
great
beer
from
lagunitas
i
felt
like
i
was
sick
and
my
mom
was
forcing
me
to
take
the
cough
syrup
overall
more
of
a
doppelbock
than
i
was
expecting
good
but
with
not
much
to
offer
d
decent
doesnt
blow
me
away
kind
of
tame
but
it
sure
gets
the
job
done
m
medium
to
full
bodied
nice
carbonation
drinkability
is
alright
the
alcohol
is
really
warm
on
this
one
and
that
hurts
a
little
but
not
much
nice
body
but
not
so
heavy
that
i
wouldnt
drink
23
d
pretty
nice
i
look
forward
to
having
another
though
im
not
sure
how
many
i
could
drink
in
one
sitting
the
9
is
keeping
me
warm
this
evening
would
recommend
trying
toasted
malts
and
herbal
hop
bitterness
up
front
grape
prune
and
powdered
sugar
sweetness
come
on
strong
sting
of
herbal
slightly
piny
hop
bitterness
tempers
the
sweetness
fruity
warming
alcohol
before
a
finish
of
herbal
hop
bitterness
and
tangysweet
grape
juice
pretty
tasty
mediumbodied
with
a
slightly
overcarbonated
feel
a
little
creaminess
wouldnt
hurt
another
decent
american
strong
ale
from
petaluma
poured
into
a
straight
pint
pours
a
rich
mahogany
color
that
when
held
up
to
light
turns
an
amber
color
strong
head
that
dissipates
at
a
moderate
rate
that
eventually
leads
to
outstanding
lacing
amazing
sweet
malty
aroma
that
also
has
a
light
floral
hoppy
aroma
smells
strong
alcoholwise
as
well
a
slight
hint
of
prunes
finishes
it
off
this
beer
is
so
complex
flavorwise
the
malts
are
sweet
off
the
bat
and
the
hops
just
kick
the
palate
in
the
ass
for
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
overwhelming
with
all
the
flavor
not
quite
a
session
beer
but
three
of
these
and
i
am
ready
to
party
thank
you
lagunitas
hairy
eyeball
ale
pours
a
dark
copper
from
a
brown
twelve
ounce
bottle
and
displays
quite
a
bit
of
ruby
when
held
to
the
light
there
is
a
thick
ivory
colored
head
the
aroma
is
malty
and
esteryfruity
the
flavor
is
very
fruity
and
malty
not
much
hops
which
only
provide
some
bitterness
alcohol
is
not
really
noticeable
in
the
flavor
as
much
as
it
is
in
how
its
warming
me
not
bad
worth
a
try
another
solid
beer
from
lagunitas
nothing
stellar
or
unique
but
a
fine
beer
nonetheless

this

by

will
have

lagunitas
packs
a
punch
good
mouthfeel
and
average
drinkability
wouldnt
specifically
run
out
and
cop
this
one
again
but
it
was
still
a
solid
brew
strong
rich
flavors
with
dark
overtones
a
good
depiction
of
the
style
worth
a
try
nice
mouth
feel
on
this
brew
and
a
good
finish
too
ill
definitely
be
drinking
this
one
again
final
note
dont
drink
this
one
too
cold
slightly
chilled
brings
out
all
the
delicious
flavors
d
overall
typical
lagunitas
hopping
and
really
nothing
to
get
excited
about
some
alcohol
warming
providing
for
a
moderate
good
drinkability
overall
another
good
offering
from
lagunitas
poured
a
very
viscous
amber
with
virtually
no
head
on
it
had
the
look
of
a
high
alcohol
barleywine
smelled
cherries
wood
and
maybe
a
little
nuttiness
right
off
the
bat
was
expecting
that
same
flavor
of
cherries
but
it
was
lacking
a
little
very
woody
and
caramel
flavor
with
little
bit
of
a
bourbonvery
light
feel
malty
backbone
came
through
for
a
good
balance
with
a
clittle
bit
of
citrus
hops
mouthfeel
was
fairly
slick
and
oily
but
not
over
the
top
i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
it
certainly
didnt
feel
like

i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
would
drink
it
again

didnt

it

bottle
from

tulip
glass
poured
a
deep
ruby
with
a
small
tan
head
aroma
contains
hops
caramel
and
a
touch
of
alcohol
flavour
reminded
me
a
lot
of
bourbon
the
alcohol
came
to
the
fore
and
there
was
a
pleasant
oakiness
i
think
the
oakiness
balanced
off
the
sweetness
of
the
malt
somewhat
mouthfeel
is
thick
making
this
one
a
sipper
overall
i
would
have
been
happier
if
the
alcohol
was
more
muted
but
it
still
made
for
a
nice
drink
decent
beer
i
enjoyed
this
beer
a
lot
it
may
not
seem
like
it
with
a
description
like
fresh
dirt
but
it
fits
into
the
flavor
profile
nicely
plus
but
the
alcohol
seems
to
mute
it
a
bit
and
if
my
naiveté
is
skewing

insanely

not

in

the

element
cant
keep
up
with
the

i
cant
tell
if
its
weak
or
the

are
just
overdone

im
not
in

with

but
i
would

it
on
occasion
ive
always
enjoyed
the
names
of
the
lagunitas
beers
labels
always
catch
my
eye
in
the
beer
store
as
well
best
of
all
ive
had
good
success
in
the
taste
department
which
in
the
end
is
what
matters
most
i
highly
recomend
this
beer
im
sure
it
would
be
good
in
a
different
way
with
some
cellaring
but
i
dont
think
i
need
to
wait
because
its
so

poured
from
the

pleasant
aroma
is
a
blend
of
sweet
caramel
malt
fruity
hops
and
a
molasses
or
bourbonish
sweetness
palate
is
sweet
caramel
and
toffee
up

blending
with
a
light
hoppiness
that
contains
notes
of
plums
and
dates
a
light
astringency
emerges
on
the
finish
rich
creamy
body
both
carries
the
flavor
and
disguises
the
alcohol
a
little
bit
very
easy
drinking
considering
its
strength
truly
an
enjoyable
winter
ale
the
aroma
is
sweet
brown
sugar
and
molasses
but
not
strong
however
this
ale
is
clearly
hopped
the
flavor
is
predominantly
drybitter
some
bitter
chocolate
flavors
underlined
by
caramel
and
fruit
sweetness
the
body
is
way
to
thin
for
a
beer
of
this
potency
though
the
alcohol
is
not
overwhelming
in
fact
the
light
body
makes
it
a
bit
too
drinkable
and
could
potentially
get
you
in
trouble
for
example
if
you
did
not

the

a

the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
in
the
taste
and
only
manifests

this
beer
is
dangerously
drinkable
even
at

this
has
become
my
favorite

defenitly
not

also
good

overall
is
a

light
for

packs
increases

lowers

points
for
sure
abv
is
masked
by
the
somewhat
flavorinhibiting
hop
bitterness
which
is
probably
a
plus
methinks
this
to
be
a
massproduced
unfocused
strong
beer
like
a
steel
reserve
for
the
beer
advocate
set
the
color
is
dark
maroon
with
a
ruby
glow
when
viewed
against
a
light
source
the
head
is
goodsized
somewhat
creamy
and
light
brown
aroma
is
of
citrusy
west
coast
hops
with
an
underlying
rich
maltiness
the
aroma
is
just
a
little
subdued
compared
to
what
i
expected
a
sip
starts
with
a
tasty
citrusy
hop
flavor
with
a
nice
bitterness
then
the
rich
malts
kick
in
and
give
the
beer
a
much
more
complex
taste
there
is
a
nice
richness
here
yet
it
never
seems
like
it
would
stop
you
from
drinking
more
than
one
bomber
this
is
definently
a
bigger
beer
that
is
deceptive
in
its
ease
of
drinkability
totally
recommended

so
an

d
this

its

best
ive
had
from

its

what
have
we
here
i
said
to
myself
as
i
poured
out
a
deep
auburn
brew
i
thin
tan
head
caught
my
eye
and
said
i
am
going
to
be
a
tasty
beer
the
smell
was
smooth
and
sweet
just
like
many
other
things
that
i
love
the
smoothness
carried
over
fromt
the
smell
to
the
taste
under
the
guidance
of
a
sweet
somewhat
carmel
taste
it
was
strong
and
and
bold
and
overall
a
nice
beer
drinkability
and
overall
this
is
another
excellent
beer
from
lauginats
its
the
second
of
theirs
ive
had
bother
barleywines
and
while
the
gnarlywine
was

still
a

ass
brew
full

complexity
yet
incredibly
smooth

strong
smells
of

tastes

sweet
for
my
taste
and
yummy
nuts
lovely

and
hops
that
finally
come
out
and
express
themselves
as

hints
of
milk
chocolate
emerge
in
the
finish
after
it

the
high
alcohol
in
this

is

nose
and
mouth
but
definitely
warms
the
gut

rating
the
last
bottle
of
a

it
took
me
the
first
five
for
this
beer
to

because
the
sweetness
was
just
too
much
but
now
i
find
this
beer
pretty
pleasant
a
really

to
the
dryness
facilitated
by
the
hop
bitters
understated
woody
and
lightly
floral
hop
flavor
persists
throughout
nearly
full
bodied
but
at
a
low
enough
viscosity
to
permit
effortless
sipping
as
the
beer
warms
hints
of
red
apple
esters
complement
malt
derived
sweetness
finishes
with
a
surge
of
cuspate
hop
bitterness
and
trace
vanilla
notions
fleeting
quickly
a
rather
delicious
brew
that
sits
dangerously
softly
on
the
palate
although
hairy
eyeball
lacks
the
complexities
of
a
top
notch
barleywine
or
strong
ale
its
cleanly
crafted
nature
will
most
likely
make
it
a
staple
of
mine
while
it
lasts
tasty
indeed
on
tap
at
the
venerable
collins
bar
in
midtown
nyc
this
sipper
poured
dark
amber
with
shimmering
highlights
it
boosted
a
tan
head
and
left
fine
well
developed
lacing
this
is
a
hoppymalty
bulldog
of
a
beer
tasty
and
well
balanced
solid
malt
package
in
counterpoint
to
a
respectable
hop
wollop
full
bodied
obviously
well
crafted
well
worth
a
try
most
of
the
flavors
here
are
pretty
good
molasses
and
alcohol
both
come
through
pretty
strong
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
and
sharp
and
the
drinkability
takes
a
bit
of
a
hit
from
the
readily
apparent
alcohol
first
sip
reveals
an
average
body
with
light
gentle
rolling
carbonation
flavor
is
similar
to
nose
some
sweet
caramel
and
toffee
with
grassy
hops
and
a
bit
of
peppery
alcohol
on
the
finish
overall
nice
and
well
balanced
overall
a
good
malty
brew
kind
of
like
a
scottish
ale
drinkability
im
all
set
with
one
its
actually
a
nice
beer
with
lots
of
complexity
but
i
just
cant
bring
myself
to
the
point
of
saying
i
really
enjoyed
it
deep
amber
in
color
with
just
the
thinnist
wisps
of
tannish
head
very
lightly
carbonated
the
beer
gives
off
a
toasty
malt
aroma
with
cherrylike
fruity
undertones
more
toasty
malts
in
the
flavor
which
develop
hints
of
brown
sugar
and
spicecake
flavors
some
fruitiness
follows
sort
of
a
cross
between
rum
soaked
raisins
and
maraschino
cherry
but
always
with
a
spicy
alcoholic
edge
toastiness
returns
and
combines
with
a
reasonably
substantial
hop
bitterness
for
a
lingering
slightly
prickly
aftertaste
a
bit
heavy
i
cant
see
myself
having
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
row
but
not
bad
not
that
great
and
i
usually
hope
for
more
taste
and
complexity
in
a
barleywine
mouthfeel
mediumfull
body
actually
quite
light
considering
the
strength
full
but
not
heavy
in
otherwords
top
notch
stuff
here
people
when
i
poured
this
beer
it
was
a
very
dark
amber
red
with
a
great
head
that
left
large
ammounts
of
lacing
around
the
glass
the
smell
was
unique
with
a
mix
of
carmel
malts
various
spices
and
a
touch
of
cedar
this
beers
flavor
was
unique
as
well
with
a
good
dose
of
carmel
malt
sweetness
which
opens
up
into
a
nice
subtle
hop
bitterness
and
spice
flavors
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
airy
and
complements
the
beer
very
nicely
this
is
another
good
beer
from
lagunitas
i
tasted
this
beer
because
i
like
a
lot
of
lagunitas
beers
but
moreso
because
of
the
ingenious
name
it
pours
a
dark
red
with
very
little
head
development
swirling
the
glass
brings
more
of
the
foam
out
but
it
dissipates
quikly
the
aroma
is
full
of
caramel
flavors
along
with
a
nondescript
hop
scent
and
a
bit
of
a
cinnamon
roll
scent
the
flavor
is
very
malty
with
a
light
hop
bitterness
at
the
end
it
feels
and
tastes
a
bit
sandy
on
the
palate
with
nores
of
cotton
candy
and
sweet
fruits
and
banana
overall
its
a
decent
barley
wine
but
it
really
didnt
spark
any
great
desire
to
have
it
again
being
an
english
barley
wine
it
is
not
surprising
that
the
hops
are
a
bit
more
mellow
than
an
american
barley
wine
overall
heres
lookin
atcha
beer
speaks
people
mumble
drinkability
quite
and
interesting
beer
with
lots
of
good
qualities
the
alcohol
is
very
pronounced
though
i
only
had
one
this
trip
but
should
have
had
another
because
it
really
was
a
good
and
interesting
beer
this
brew
already
tastes
like
a
well
aged
barley
wine
excellent
pours
a
deep
ruby
color
topped
by
a
creamy
tan
head
in
the
aroma
i
get
notes
of
crystal
malt
and
a
hint
of
citrusy
hops
at
the
end
aroma
has
notes
of
toasted
biscuit
malt
as
well
wow
a
smooth
creamy
body
greets
my
tongue
as
i
take
the
firs
sip
of
this
beer
it
is
lightly
sweet
up
front
and
finishes
with
a
fruitiness
that
reminds
me
of
raisins
there
is
a
slight
bit
of
bitterness
in
the
finish
just
enough
to
provide
a
foil
to
the
maltiness
that
is
the
centerpoint
of
this
beer
this
beer
is
a
very
nice
well
balanced
beer
it
is
so
smooth
and
well
integrated
if
you
like
malt
accented
strong
ales
witha
bit
of
balancing
hops
then
this
beer
is
for
you
22

and
pleasant

but
that
does
not
detract
from

very
nice
beer
very
drinkable
brew
only
negative
to
it
might
be
its
strength
of
flavor
and
alcohol

recommended

again

a
nice
whiteoff

the
aromas
are
a

subdued

very
malty
in
nature
the
hops
are
in
there
as
well
but
they
are
in
the
background
a
bit
this
smells
sweet
and
boozy
with
some
lovely
roasted

notes
as
well
nice
the
taste
is
very
full
malty
and
sweet
up

with
a
distinct
roastiness
as
well
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
almost
syrupychewy
and
the
drinkability
is
damn
excellent
man
is
this
a
good
brewery
or
what
drinker
beware
i
dont
know
what
it
is
about
this
ale
but
it
made
me
a
bit
light
headed
it
was
the
only
drink
i
had
tonight
but
the
alcohol
snuck
up
on
me
quite
unexpectedly
cheers

medium

full

nice
thick
rich
and
creamy

great
carbonation
to
lighten
it
up
a
little
the
great
balance
and
hiding
of
alcohol
make
this
exceptionally
drinkable
this

down
scary
easy
for
an

brew
half
a
pint
down
and
im
already
feeling
it

makes
for

worth
seeking
update

i
originally
rated
this
with

so
thought
it
would
be
interesting
to
review
it
again
with
an
04
drank
in

this
really
is
an

and
the

the

this

reminds

in

into

in

several
consecutive
sips
leaves
me
with
the
sensation
that
ive
just
finished
a
flat

its
odd
because
i
really
want
to
like
this
beer
but
like

it
just
falls
short
i
tasted
it

i
was
so
dissapointed
with
the

one
i
wanted
to
be
sure
before
reviewing
it
its
uncomplex
nonmalty
and
kinda
sour
it
tastes
like
a
beefed
up

or
a
high

theres
no
roastiness
and
no
toastiness

the
obvious
use
of
darker

the

lend
neither
any

and
dont
even
really
do
a
very
good
job
of
offsetting
the
sweetness
of
the
nonfermented
fermentables
this
is
a
very
average
strong
beer
since
its
very
hard
to
achieve
this
little
flavor
with
this
many
raw
ingredients
pours

then
begin
to
take
over
setting
up
a
bitter

of

leaf
and
a
hint
of
citrus
the
hop
oils
create
a
slick
feel
in
the

throughout
and
the
alcohol
begins
to

the

warms
a
great

again

not

those
who
are
scared
of
such
things
ill
take
this
one
anytime
i
would
have
put
in

category
but
it
prob
fits
both
styles
fairly
close
ive
got
to
give
this
one
style
points
just
for
the
name
seriously
though
i
agree
with
the
first
reviewer
that
this
beer
is
reminiscent
of
stone
brewings
arrogant
bastard
it
looks
similar
and
the
same
smells

are
there
but
theyre
just
a
little
more
subtle
perhaps
except
for
the
hops
pretty
reddishamber
color
good
tan

that
retains
well
maybe
a
little
less
balanced

ab
more

very
good

taste

very
much
in

of
hops
so
this
ale
as
bitter
as
a
standard
ipa
but
its
sweet
and
peppery
and
therefore
fairly
well
balanced
excepting
malt
qualities
probably
owing
as
much
to
the
high
alcohol
says
9

on
my
bottle
not
9
7
as
it
is
to
the
variety
of
hops
a
strong
and
more
bitter
aftertaste
but
still
sweet
and
peppery
somewhat
like
a
vegetable
broth
but
not
overwhelming
like
youd
notice
in
bridgeports
hop
czar
imperial
ipa
for
example
its
warming
as
and
after
it
goes
down
theres
a
slight
chewyoily
sensation
on
my
teeth
as
it
lingers
and
even
after
its
gone
leaves
the
mouth
fairly
dry
and
constricted
especially
if
you
wait
a
few
minutes
the
combination
of
the
bitter
warming
and
drying
qualities
cause
my
lips
tongue
teeth
and
hard
palate
to
feel
pleasantly
numb
my
brain
is
probably
next
thank
you

at

me
finish

caramel
flavors
with
a
good
bitter
punch
one
of
my
favorites
ive
had
from
lagunitas
will
look
for
some
in
the
store
next
time
o
this
beer
is
pretty
intense
and
i
wasnt
really
expecting
that
when
i
poured
it
perhaps
its
because
my
only
other
taste
of
lagunitas
is
the
very
smooth
little
sumpin
ale
a
decent
beer
but
it
wouldnt
be
my
goto
for
lagunitas
even
with
my
limited
exposure
great
pouring
beer
with
an
even
better
taste
well
balanced
and
surprisingly
smooth
considering
the
high
abv
any
review
of
this
beer
may
be
subject
to
intoxication
one
pint
of
this
ale
will
twist
reality
unlike
many
beers
with
the
abv
of
undercover
you
will
want
to
pour
another
and
enter
the
realm
of
4
5
stars
of
pure
enjoyment
a
great
beer
an
american
strong
ale
certainly
not
a
malty
high
abv
barleywine
but
similar
taste
characteristics
fantastiic
aroma
love
me
some
strong
ales
this
one
is
a
keeper
a
good
beer
to
keep
in
the
fridge
to
contrast
with
your
super
hoppy
beers
without
having
to
stray
too
far
from
that
dipa
style
uisda
is
an
interesting
but
ultimately
unconvincing
experiment
there
are
a
lot
of
styles
being
thrown
around
here
including
dipa
american
barleywine
and
weizenbock
which
i
assume
is
what
led
the
brewers
to
label
it
as
the
nebulous
strong
ale
despite
my
negative
comments
id
like
to
revisit
this
beer
afresh
when
its
less
than
a
month
old
as
i
think
the
desired
flavors
will
be
more
present
still
i
expected
better
shelflife
from
a
4monthold
refrigerated

abv
beer
from
an
otherwise
excellent
brewery
taste
is
resinous
pine
eased
by
sweet
toffee
with
bitter
herb
in
the
back
rounding
it
out
the
bitter
and
sweet
swing
around
the
beautiful
malt
backbone
this
is
a
big
delicious
beer
o
delicious
beer
here
fantastically
balanced
hops
alcohol
and
sweetness
from
the
citrus
fruits
that
are
perfectly
complimenting
each
other
full
bodied
and
strong
66
ibus
is
hidden
well
with
the
sweetness
that
i
can
taste
excellent
flavor
aroma
and
beautiful
orange
hue
another
solid
strong
ale
from
lagunitas
i
like
this
one
better
than
brown
shugga
but
not
as
much
as
the
bastards
stone
the
flavors
are
wellbalanced
but
the
bitterness
on
the
finish
is
slightly
unpleasant
and
it
needs
a
little
something
to
push
it
over
the
top
perhaps
some
oakaging
to
add
some
vanilla
notes
complement
the
booziness
and
smooth
out
the
finish
overall
a
very
solid
beer
one
of
my
first
possibly
the
first
american
strong
ale
and
i
love
it
lots
of
flavor
the
alcohol
is
masterfully
masked
this
was
a
good
one
very
well
balanced
between
flavoring
hops
bittering
hops
and
malt
to
the
extreme
in
flavor
and
malt
perhaps
just
a
touch
you
sweet
i
love
lagunitas
o
great
and
easy
to
drink
for
the
abv
nice
price
solid
lagunitas
as
usual
o
nice
flavors
overly
boozy
but
still
very
good
overall
overall
i
am
very
impressed
with
this
brew
it
is
a
great
stand
alone
brew
and
shows
some
interesting
potential
for
aging
a
good
beer
i
wish
lagunitas
had
a
better
method
of
indicating
freshness
i
can
only
hope
that
this
bottle
was
from
this
year
even
so
i
think
this
dropped
in
april
so
im
not
drinking
it
nearly
as
fresh
as
i
should
have
still
its
held
up
well
good
beer
full
bodied
and
a
little
bit
on
the
heavy
side
makes
for
a
very
satisfying
craft
beer
experience
dig
it
can
only
drink
1
though
shits
like
a
hammer
pours
a
dark
amber
in
color
with
a
good
finger
foamy
offwhite
head
a
good
amount
of
lacing
is
seen
with
each
sip
that
sticks
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
ripe
oranges
at
first
with
brown
sugar
the
taste
is
the
same
and
starts
out
that
way
with
a
slightly
bitter
malt
finish
but
doesnt
linger
you
can
also
taste
the
higher
alcohol
content
in
as
well
perfect
carbonation
a
different
brew
but
tasty
you
arent
going
to
drink
a
bunch
of
these
in
one
sitting
that
is
for
sure
big
and
bold
strong
ale
that
is
not
without
its
flavorful
hops
or
delicious
malt
backbone
another
winner
from
lagunitas
o
a
nice
surprise
from
lagunitas
ive
enjoyed
all
their
offerings
so
far
a
great
ipa
juicy
and
smooth
recommended
overall
not
impressed
and
one
of
my
least
favorite
hoppy
beers
from
lagunitas
the
sweetness
almost
seems
generic
with
not
enough
malt
flavor
to
match
it
does
open
up
a
little
bit
as
it
warms
but
also
gets
boozier
finishes
a
bit
bitter
and
astringent
for
my
liking
decent
but
not
something
i
will
seek
out
in
the
future
o
overall
a
tasty
beer
and
for
the
price
and
availability
i
will
almost
certainly
be
drinking
this
one
again
in
the
future
overall
all
and
all
this
is
a
pretty
good
ale
maybe
a
dipa
melody
to
it
overall
honestly
the
same
brew
as
the
other
undercover
ale
just
missing
the
sneak
release
label
on
the
bottle
whether
it
is
considered
a
dipa
or
american
strong
ale
that
is
up
to
you
i
had
this
earlier
during
the
week
and
had
it
at
the
very
least
five
times
addicting
great
brew
and
especially
great
price
drink
up
and
happy
memorial
day
salud
cheers
a
nice
ale
but
not
anything
to
write
home
about
it
is
good
nice
aroma
and
good
tase
but
to
me
seems
to
lack
a
little
care
almost
seems
to
be
leaning
to
the
mass
produced
less
quality
style
that
too
many
of
the
big
brewers
produce
dont
get
me
wrong
this
is
a
good
beer
and
by
no
way
i
am
not
comparing
to
the
bud
lites
of
the
world
it
is
enjoyable
but
doesnt
quite
reach
the
standards
that
have
been
set
by
other
craft
brewers
overall
good
job
o
i
have
to
admit
that
i
read
the
label
we
brewed
this
especially
bitter
ale
and
i
thought
no
good
i
do
not
like
really
bitter
beers
this
got
shoved
to
the
back
of
the
fridge
i
have
to
admit
i
really
like
it
it
is
not
nearly
as
bitter
as
i
feared
there
are
some
bitter
notes
in
the
middle
but
really
well
balanced
with
pine
and
fruit
flavors
there
is
a
slight
dry
bite
at
the
end
but
it
is
not
unpleasant
also
the
9
7
abv
comes
through
a
little
bit
with
some
heat
overall
this
is
well
balanced
and
really
drinkable
this
is
an
amazing
brew
pours
a
beautiful
dark
amber
color
with
a
nice
thick
white
head
lots
of
lacing
on
the
glass
as
you
sip
as
looks
go
you
cant
do
better
then
this
once
poured
you
wont
be
able
to
wait
to
sip
this
brew
the
high
abv
isnt
unbalanced
in
the
taste
of
this
brew
it
has
a
nice
hop
flavor
but
not
over
board
very
smooth
drinking
with
a
slight
dryness
very
clean
on
the
palate
its
not
heavy
or
in
your
face
but
full
bodied
and
flavorful
the
smell
is
pleasant
the
hop
comes
thru
on
the
smell
big
time
this
is
an
awesome
brew
i
had
it
a
while
back
but
never
rated
it
so
was
waiting
to
try
again
before
rating
lagunitas
hit
this
one
out
of
the
park
as
far
as
this
beer
drinkers
concerned
pours
a
clear
medium
amber
with
a
slight
dark
ruby
cast
an
exceptional
head
that
retains
excellently
with
massive
lacing
this
is
how
a
beer
should
look
the
nose
is
a
blend
of
sweet
tropical
hops
over
a
slight
grapefruit
coupled
with
a
sweet
caramel
background
almost
full
bodied
with
a
nice
creamy
mouthfeel
slightly
below
normal
carbonation
with
just
a
touch
of
effervescence
on
the
finish
the
flavor
profile
is
quite
nice
complex
and
fairly
well
balanced
it
begins
with
the
tropical
and
grapefruit
hops
of
the
nose
which
flows
into
a
pleasant
tasty
bitterness
the
bitterness
fades
into
the
background
hop
and
caramel
sweetness
the
finish
is
smooth
and
a
slight
medicinal
alcoholic
bite
lingers
the
medicinal
finish
is
the
only
flaw
with
this
well
crafted
exceptional
ale
but
at
9
7
alcohol
it
is
minimal
excellent
job
lagunitas
o
this
in
a
lot
of
ways
reminds
me
of
a
blend
of
lake
erie
monster
and
nugget
nectar
it
has
the
booze
and
super
ripe
tropical
notes
of
lem
with
the
bitter
hop
balance
and
malt
profile
of
nugget
nectar
overall
its
a
really
good
beer
pours
a
deep
clear
amber
with
a
big
creamy
ivory
head
the
head
has
impressive
retention
and
lasts
throughout
leaving
nice
sticky
lacing
the
aroma
is
delicious
with
nice
balance
between
the
floral
and
citrus
hops
and
the
robust
malt
backbone
the
taste
is
even
more
complex
with
a
wide
variety
of
malt
and
hops
flavors
balancing
against
each
other
and
holding
the
whole
beer
up
id
expect
such
a
complicated
beer
to
be
a
little
heavier
in
body
but
it
in
no
way
is
a
problem
and
there
is
a
nice
smooth
finish
this
is
a
great
example
of
a
strong
ale
overall
this
ones
an
easy
drinker
for
the
style
flavor
profile
and
abv
comparable
to
a
less
malty
less
boozy
hopslam
dont
know
if
its
a
favorite
but
youll
not
be
disappointed
at
all
if
you
buy
this
one
overall
good
shit
nice
brew
cute
story
a
fine
brew
from
lagunitas
taste
somewhere
between
a
dipa
and
a
barleywine
to
me
moderate
brown
in
color
with
a
solid
quarter
inch
thick
light
brown
head
decent
clarity
bit
clearly
there
is
some
kind
of
minuscule
sediment
in
there
when
held
up
to
light
brussels
lacing
that
telltale
hop
aroma
is
consistent
with
other
lagunitas
beers
its
more
of
a
pint
like
hop
aroma
but
is
clearly
a
blend
with
some
tropical
smelling
hops
i
also
get
some
alcohol
and
a
belgian
yeast
aroma
and
light
malt
the
front
of
the
palate
is
sweet
grains
and
alcohol
which
quickly
jumps
into
that
pineytropical
hop
flavor
then
there
is
moderate
carbonation
and
the
warmth
of
alcohol
the
fade
is
dry
and
more
along
the
lines
of
the
warming
alcohol
poured
dark
amberhoney
colored
into
a
tulip
glass
with
a
thick
foamy
head
and
moderate
lacing
on
the
side
of
the
glass
strong
citrus
and
slightly
piney
odor
citrusy
malty
flavor
at
the
beginning
followed
by
a
slight
piney
hoppy
finish
it
leaves
slight
hoppy
aftertaste
but
not
much
it
goes
down
very
smooth
and
hides
the
alcohol
content
very
well
very
well
balanced
beer
very
good
be
careful
because
it
is
definitely
not
a
session
beer
o
lagunitas
always
finds
ways
to
make
amazing
beers
that
are
both
aggressively
hoppy
yet
smooth
and
balanced
and
this
is
no
exception
glad
i
had
the
chance
to
try
this
o
maybe
its
me
and
i
dont
like
american
strong
ales
but
this
has
an
off
flavor
and
i
cant
entirely
pinpoint
it
either
way
i
will
finish
it
no
indication
of
when
this
was
brewed
but
this
bottle
was
obtain
this
year
in
march
poured
this
beer
in
a
pint
glass
dark
copper
color
almost
reddish
smells
hoppish
and
the
taste
is
irresistable
as
i
i
have
known
from
the
other
two
from
this
brewery
goes
down
smooth
for
its
abv
and
ibu
and
o
g
cant
say
enough
about
this
beer
worth
trying
another
2
thumbs
up
slight
carbonation
and
the
malts
help
prevent
it
from
being
too
thin
o
not
a
fan
of
this
style
of
beer
i
like
lagunitas
and
its
obvious
they
spent
some
time
and
energy
creating
this
unique
beer
but
it
was
not
enjoyable
for
me
almost
a
mix
between
a
dipa
and
barlywine
overall
this
is
closer
to
a
dipa
then
a
strong
ale
the
alcohol
and
malts
are
what
keep
this
from
a
dipa
really
sweet
and
strong
and
very
tasty
a
bit
of
a
sipper
but
very
tasty
and
glad
i
finally
got
to
try
sounds
weird
and
this
brew
is
quite
different
i
like
it
fresh
and
age
takes
away
the
sharp
veggie
vibe
last
years
is
quite
good
right
now
most
strong
ales
ive
had
are
darker
and
deeper
this
expands
its
flavor
profile
away
from
dipa
towards
sweetness
and
effervescence
saison
style
ooverall
a
great
strong
ale
way
to
go
lagunitas
youve
never
have
disappoint
me
yet
overall
satisfying
pretty
tasty
up
to
lagunitas
standards
but
not
something
i
would
run
to
buy
again
found
this
recent
was
drawn
to
abv
initially
however
this
is
an
outstanding
beer
as
others
have
noted
a
bit
similar
to
dfh90
but
a
bit
on
the
mellower
side
definitely
a
rich
beer
with
the
alcohol
hidden
be
careful
with
more
than
one
as
this
beer
will
sneak
up
on
you
picked
this
up
as
part
of
a
mixed
6
well
hate
to
admit
it
but
it
was
because
of
the
name
very
interesting
good
looking
beer
with
an
awesome
smell
that
has
a
good
bit
going
on
very
interesting
beer
reminds
me
more
of
an
ipa
than
anything
wasnt
what
i
was
expecting
enjoyed
it
plus
it
gets
a
lot
of
bonus
point
due
to
the
high
abv
would
get
again
depending
upon
cost
at
i
believe
2
50
cheaper
this
has
now
usurped
and
falls
into
lead
position
its
been
said
before
on
many
a
thread
but
im
now
a
true
believer
that
lagunitas
provides
top
3
bang
for
buck
the
taste
begins
with
a
delightful
toasted
biscuit
malt
character
but
then
the
earthy
hops
really
kick
in
and
take
everything
over
to
result
in
a
dry
finish
nice
beer
that
is
worth
a
try
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
great
for
a
nightcap
or
when
you
want
something
with
a
bit
more
kick
enjoy
cheers
what
a
wonderful
beer
ive
been
a
fan
of
lagunitas
for
a
while
but
never
saw
this
on
the
shelf
till
recently
it
pours
a
beautiful
brown
into
my
ipa
glass
with
a
nice
thick
1
inch
head
it
reminds
me
of
a
slightly
hoppier
dfh
90
minute
a
very
nice
hoppes
presence
but
with
a
malty
end
all
in
all
a
very
good
beer
with
a
well
hidden
kick
the
taste
is
a
complex
blend
of
citrus
ans
spice
flavors
from
nw
hops
and
some
yeast
in
the
taste
which
brings
a
fruity
dark
berry
quality
with
moderately
sweet
almost
caramel
flavor
in
the
malt
which
supports
the
hop
bitterness
the
alcohol
is
relatively
subdued
and
emphasizes
a
slight
spicepinelike
element
more
toward
the
finish
but
there
is
still
enough
sweetness
to
blanket
the
palate
as
it
finishes
smooth
overall
i
like
the
intensity
it
is
a
little
sweeter
than
most
in
this
style
could
almost
be
blurring
the
lines
of
english
barleywine
but
is
very
hoppy
which
is
why
i
think
it
fits
the
style
of
american
strong
well
pretty
drinkable
but
i
would
share
this
if
possible
the
verdict
delicious
complex
and
well
balanced
this
is
another
great
example
of
lagunitas
stand
out
american
strong
ales
id
love
to
down
the
six
pack
but
i
dont
think
id
make
it
through
two
of
them
maybe
i
should
have
eaten
something
o
for
the
style
this
is
an
exceptional
beer
however
this
is
too
reminiscent
of
lagunitas
brown
shugga
to
make
it
stand
out
in
their
profile
however
being
an
absolute
fan
of
the
latter
i
am
fortunate
to
have
a
similar
yet
seasonal
offering
without
having
to
wait
an
entire
year
if
you
assume
that
ucisda
is
yet
another
double
ipa
then
think
again
if
you
are
a
fan
of
fresh
brown
shugga
then
you
can
revel
in
a
second
round
come
this
spring
seasonal

the
forefront
along
with
tropical
fruit
and
resin
from
the
hops
sweet
and
boozy
with
very
little
back
end
bitterness
warms
the
chest
once
its
down
full
mouthfeel
with
ample
carbonation
to
keep
it
from
feeling
like
syrup
while
there
is
definitely
hop
bitterness
at
the
end
there
is
not
quite
enough
to
give
this
beer
balance
and
it
comes
across
as
rather
too
sweet
and
heavy
while
its
not
perfect
it
is
definitely
unique
and
has
its
own
signature
flavor
lagunitas
makes
my
favorite
beers
hands
down
little
sumpin
sumpin
brown
sugga
lagunitas
sucks
are
all
amazing
brews
and
undercover
investigation
is
set
to
join
the
line
of
winners
from
this
brewery
this
beer
has
it
all
much
like
brown
sugga
but
i
think
this
one
has
a
bit
more
bitterness
from
whatever
hop
profile
was
used
the
sweetness
is
also
a
bit
more
cane
sugar
and
honey
where
brown
sugga
is
what
it
says
really
been
liking
lagunitas
lately
and
this
one
boosts
my
overall
impression
of
them
o
this
is
the
probably
the
first
lagunitas
beer
i
actually
dont
like
still
its
not
exactly
bad
there
are
whispers
of
a
good
strong
ale
to
be
found
what
a
shame
the
extensive
caramel
backbone
runs
roughshod
over
everything
that
and
it
becomes
rather
harsh
when
warmed
up
sufficiently
i
wont
be
returning
to
this
one
when
just
about
everything
else
from
lagunitas
shows
off
their
awesome
house
character
better
another
offering
from
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
this
one
pours
a
beautiful
reddish
light
mahogany
color
with
an
ample
and
lasting
off
white
head
that
leaves
very
substantial
lacing
the
aroma
is
a
perfect
blend
of
west
coast
hops
and
rich
malty
sweetness
the
nose
is
quite
dank
with
citrus
pine
and
grass
hops
as
well
as
a
very
nice
amount
of
malt
to
balance
the
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
but
thick
and
coating
in
the
best
way
the
flavor
is
everything
the
nose
promises
but
not
quite
so
balanced
it
is
a
very
well
crafted
beer
but
the
hops
slightly
overtake
the
malt
in
the
mouth
it
is
sweet
but
not
the
rich
sweetness
that
you
get
from
a
well
made
barleywine
almost
unnecessarily
sweet
this
is
good
but
not
my
favorite
from
lagunitas
o
lagunitas
did
a
great
job
with
this
beer
not
overpowering
for
a
strong
ale
and
the
abv
content
is
not
that
noticeable
pours
a
clear
dark
copper
color
with
over
a
finger
of
offwhite
head
that
retains
for
some
time
the
nose
is
mildly
hoppy
the
hop
bitterness
is
there
in
the
flavor
but
the
driving
force
of
this
beer
is
certainly
the
malt
the
body
is
light
considering
the
abv
and
malt
forward
nature
of
the
offering
the
finish
is
semidry
and
the
alcohol
warmth
rears
its
head
slightly
o
this
might
be
one
of
those
on
the
fence
beers
while
not
perfect
it
falls
on
the
right
side
of
the
fence
for
me
overall
this
is
a
rich
tasty
brew
with
some
nice
vinuous
grape
notes
its
got
a
bright
bitter
copper
penny
streak
running
through
it
an
enjoyable
strong
ale
but
i
think
i
prefer
brown
shugga
others
have
compared
it
to
an
ipa
x
barleywine
brew
or
a
dipa
both
comparisons
i
strongly
agree
with
o
hands
down
the
most
impressed
i
have
ever
been
of
any
beer
ive
ever
had
draft
poured
into
a
sample
glass
crystal
clear
deep
amber
color
with
a
nice
head
mild
lacing
down
the
glass
the
aroma
is
uniquea
mixture
of
grapefruit
and
mandarin
oranges
very
rich
and
rewarding
flavor
is
unique
mild
to
moderately
bitter
mild
citrus
with
a
bit
of
vanilla
mouthfeel
is
medium
almost
chewy
overall
this
is
an
outstanding
ale
and
i
cant
wait
to
try
it
again
they
keep
doing
it
i
have
reviewed
a
few
now
by
this
brewery
at
first
i
had
a
few
that
i
was
not
impressed
at
all
about
but
the
more
i
keep
trying
them
lately
it
was
me
or
i
was
getting
older
batches
something
maybe
i
should
revisit
them
although
i
have
found
that
breweries
that
do
great
ales
and
ipas
dont
make
the
best
lagers
or
pilsners
the
one
i
hit
hard
was
the
pils
anyway
to
this
one
it
was
amazing
the
hops
was
there
for
sure
but
it
was
so
well
balanced
it
was
in
the
same
line
as
the
sucks
of
which
i
have
one
or
two
left
so
i
may
do
a
comparison
anyway
the
color
was
nice
reddish
brown
and
the
aroma
was
magnificent
so
far
this
is
my
favorite
cali
brewery
for
sure
i
need
to
revisit
stone
as
i
have
been
hearing
a
lot
about
the
enjoy
by
series
anyway
this
one
is
awesome
not
much
to
complain
about
here
just
go
find
some
overall
i
like
this
beer
just
as
much
as
the
other
hoppy
offerings
from
lagu
they
make
some
damn
good
beers
theres
something
similar
about
their
beers
that
just
keeps
them
consistent
and
enjoyable
cheers
thanks
kirk
for
the
try
d
bitter
sipper
must
try
pours
dark
red
with
finger
or
so
of
head
aromas
of
sweet
sugary
fruits
and
some
hops
a
bit
west
coasty
the
flavor
has
the
hops
too
slightly
bitter
offset
bit
a
big
syrupy
fruity
maltiness
actually
a
lot
of
complexity
to
be
taken
some
darker
fruits
and
lot
of
booze
upon
warming
o
solid
brew
from
lagunitas
one
of
the
more
unique
beers
ive
had
it
seems
like
lagunitas
is
trying
to
mix
a
few
styles
and
they
do
it
well
very
drinkable
the
aroma
taste
are
what
you
what
u
want
from
lagunitas
o
another
solid
offering
from
lagunitas
worth
picking
up
o
4
5
great
strong
ale
i
like
it
better
than
the
big
name
american
barley
wines
like
sierra
nevada
bigfoot
because
its
a
little
bit
easier
drinking
at
9
7
its
not
that
much
weaker
either
o
i
liked
it
but
didnt
love
it
it
was
a
mild
disappointment
given
my
expectations
when
drinking
a
lagunitas
beer
it
just
fell
a
little
short
in
the
flavor
department
for
my
tastes
this
strong
ale
certainly
lived
up
to
its
billing
there
was
very
nice
lacing
left
in
the
glass
and
the
flavor
was
certainly
complex
this
was
billed
as
a
bitter
ale
but
i
feel
that
they
did
a
great
job
of
balancing
the
bitterness
with
other
flavors
that
allowed
for
easier
drinkability
i
did
notice
that
this
left
a
pleasant
sticky
mouthfeel
that
made
you
feel
like
you
were
drinking
something
that
was
well
made
i
also
enjoyed
that
this
ale
was
high
alcohol
without
hitting
you
over
the
head
with
it
would
definitely
look
for
this
ale
again
high
ratings
from
a
west
coast
beach
native
awesome
beer
super
sweet
and
malty
lot
like
rodeo
clown
from
karbach
o
absolutely
phenomenal
a
little
thicker
bodied
i
might
put
it
in
my
hall
of
fame
overall
i
absolutely
appreciate
the
effort
to
make
a
unique
beer
thats
why
i
seek
out
craft
beers
in
the
first
place
but
this
really
is
tough
to
drink
given
the
out
of
control
sweetness
there
are
some
good
flavors
here
too
but
the
alcohol
and
candy
flavors
just
squash
everything
for
me
d
max
would
be
two
i
would
compare
it
to
eating
more
than
one
bowl
of
ice
cream
too
much
sweetness
can
cause
damage
i
think
ill
buy
this
again
got
this
out
of
the
singles
cooler
hoping
to
put
the
question
to
rest
ha
it
wasnt
for
lack
of
effort
on
my
part
overall
i
look
forward
to
this
beer
every
year
delicious
stuff
overall
this
is
a
masterpiece
of
a
beer
the
brew
wizards
and
geniuses
at
lagunitas
struck
gold
with
this
one
o
i
go
between
what
is
my
favorite
lagunitas
and
for
a
time
it
was
this
great
beer
great
job
overall
this
is
the
last
beer
from
a
case
i
got
last
spring
an
excellent
beer
i
should
have
drank
up
fresh
i
dont
think
the
age
has
done
anything
for
this
one
and
possibly
has
hurt
the
flavor
still
its
very
good
today
but
my
next
case
will
be
gone
before
the
the
4th
of
july
enjoyed
a
single
bottle
poured
into
an
americanstyle
pub
glass
looks
like
whiskey
a
gentle
reddish
amber
color
with
a
fearsome
beige
head
of
around
four
inches
height
aroma
is
citrusforward
tangy
and
fruity
with
a
faint
chocolate
and
rum
note
raisins
grapefruit
rind
pine
oil
smells
very
hoppy
but
tastes
very
malty
i
get
a
massive
dollop
of
orange
cream
candied
mandarins
raisins
sweet
rum
brown
sugar
apple
peels
and
a
nondescript
floral
note
that
flits
in
and
out
of
awareness
there
is
enough
pine
resin
and
other
hop
aromatics
to
numb
the
mouth
just
a
little
but
a
barley
sugar
sweetness
protrudes
and
gathers
steam
settling
on
the
palate
to
keeps
things
firmly
anchored
in
malt
territory
amazing
mouthfeel
on
this
one
the
body
is
sticky
and
oily
a
buttery
chew
is
discernible
and
the
whole
package
is
syrupy
but
not
over
the
top
in
this
regard
less
boozy
than
expected
particularly
when
you
consider
than
some
other
lagunitas
brews
do
not
shy
away
from
alcohol
aromatics
e
g
the
imperial
stout
finish
is
wet
and
juicy
with
some
grass
flavors
apparent
along
with
an
earthy
spice
sweet
but
still
capable
of
inducing
some
eyewatering
hop
heroics
unique
brew
and
very
tasty
i
love
the
lagunitas
website
descriptor
imperial
mild
indeed
very
easy
to
drink
and
and
interesting
as
well
quite
a
nice
beer
that
i
would
like
to
try
again
a
nearly
full
bodied
medium
effervesced
brew
warming
from
the
middle
on
fairly
smooth
and
pretty
easy
to
drink
even
at
9
6
abv
a
solid
brew
if
it
drank
more
like
a
strong
ale
instead
of
an
imperial
ipa
i
have
rated
it
higher
this
is
another
strong
beer
from
lagunitas
both
in
terms
of
alcohol
and
flavor
it
pours
a
dark
amber
with
good
carbonation
and
a
strong
aroma
of
hops
and
toffee
the
taste
has
the
usual
lagunitas
hops
balanced
with
a
good
malt
and
caramel
backbone
this
is
definitely
a
fullbodied
beer
with
a
strong
complex
flavor
that
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
pours
a
deep
rich
amber
color
with
a
thick
foamy
rocky
head
that
clings
to
the
lip
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
a
bright
semisweet
combination
of
citrus
and
pine
that
is
bold
but
not
overly
assertive
the
flavor
is
much
more
aggressive
though
with
a
potent
resinous
pine
forest
hop
character
that
is
only
mildly
countered
by
a
bready
malt
sweetness
the
sticky
resinous
full
mouthfeel
becomes
weighty
after
a
while
overall
this
is
a
bold
hopdominant
iipastrong
ale
that
is
quite
nice
in
a
single
glass
but
might
be
too
much
for
me
to
enjoy
multiple
servings
at
once
overall
a
well
balanced
and
surprisingly
easy
drinking
ale
not
enjoying
this
one
nearly
as
much
as
before
so
downgrading
a
few
scores
quite
a
bit
smell
from
4
5
to
3
25
taste
from
4
5
to
4
mouthfeel
from
4
5
to
4
and
overall
from
4
5
to
4
in
view
of
my
previous
very
high
rating
im
going
to
get
a
sixpack
and
run
through
them
to
see
how
prevalent
the
vinegar
aroma
really
is
its
not
really
offensive
except
in
the
aroma
just
not
as
tasty
as
caramel
malt
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
14
oz
pint
glass
pours
a
cloudy
reddish
amber
with
a
small
white
head
smells
of
syrupy
alcohol
with
some
piney
and
flowery
hops
very
nice
tastes
of
earthy
hops
slight
roasted
malt
body
with
slight
booze
taste
beer
is
full
bodied
boozy
and
nicely
carbonated
overall
a
very
good
beer
overall
very
drinkable
high
abv
big
beer
quite
sweet
up
front
but
a
load
of
hops
cuts
the
sweetness
for
an
excellent
finish
highly
recommended
o
very
good
beer
overall
enjoy
the
appearance
and
aroma
more
than
the
taste
o
very
easy
drinker
for
such
a
big
beer
very
unique
flavor
profile
very
enjoyable
overall
this
is
another
winner
from
lagunitas
a
well
balanced
mix
of
malts
and
hops
which
masks
its
high
alcohol
content
very
well
a
worthy
representation
of
the
style
despite
its
chalky
and
minerally
linger
this
raw
and
rustic
ale
is
much
more
refined
than
its
inspiration
would
suggest
sure
theres
a
chip
on
their
shoulder
and
this
ale
squarely
reflects
that
but
theres
also
an
elegant
masculinity
that
suggests
that
the
brewery
has
gotten
past
that
part
of
their
history
overall
very
enjoyable
this
is
way
more
malty
than
youd
expect
from
a
lagunitas
10
brew
but
the
hop
kick
keeps
you
smiling
im
glad
i
picked
up
another
6pack
of
it
before
it
goes
away
overall
i
was
a
bit
disappointed
with
this
brew
seems
when
i
had
it
back
in
2007
it
had
more
of
a
hop
balance
also
i
am
very
sensitive
to
sourness
in
beer
and
i
am
definitely
catching
that
flavor
not
sure
if
there
was
some
unintentional
cross
pollination
at
the
brewery
a
rather
anonymous
yet
well
crafted
strong
ale
i
dont
really
see
the
point
ive
always
avoided
lagunitas
for
no
good
reason
an
extremely
irrational
avoidance
as
undercover
shows
big
boozeflavoured
but
not
as
overblown
as
it
could
have
been
retains
a
pleasant
and
complex
sweetness
the
combination
of
citrus
and
brown
sugar
reminds
me
of
ham
glaze
this
is
not
the
first
time
i
have
said
this
about
a
lagunitas
beer
and
this
also
includes
some
bread
its
like
a
meal
this
is
an
interesting
beer
but
lagunitas
lighter
offerings
are
a
better
representation
of
the
brewery
overall
one
of
my
favorite
lagunitas
choices
i
buy
it
when
i
see
it
well
rounded
woody
earthy
with
a
hop
edge
very
nice
ipa
variation
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
its
big
and
fullflavoured
while
maintaining
a
sanity
to
it
that
keeps
it
drinkable
i
enjoyed
it
a
great
deal
the
alcohol
is
hidden
well
and
the
feel
is
smooth
but
slightly
astringent
this
is
a
great
ale
not
incredibly
diverse
but
very
well
constructed
strong
malt
backing
with
plenty
of
sticky
pine
hops
makes
for
a
delicious
robust
and
balanced
dipa
alcohol
is
100
unnoticeable
just
an
allaround
solid
brew
a
lot
of
beer
big
intense
and
lasting
i
would
like
a
little
less
sweetness
on
the
palate
but
what
a
wonderful
effort
well
some
big
wraps
on
this
bad
boy
lets
see
and
it
pours
a
clear
red
copper
hue
with
a
billowing
four
finger
head
thats
stays
and
leaves

everywherethe

and
has

and
finished
like

dry

and
overall
its
definitely
a

and
really
different
to
the
rest
of

range
and
nice
for
a

a
perfect
sipper

appearance
is
a
deep
clear
reddish
color
with
generous
white
head
and
heavy
lace
nose
is
hoppy
with
note
of
pine
and
earth
paired
with
a
strong
malt

that
brings
a
bit
of

and
honey
to
the

sweet
and
malty
and
has
strong

somewhat
heavy
with
appropriate
carbonation
overall
quite
delicious
and
hoppy
borders
on
american
barleywine
territory
this
one
is
sweet
at
first
but
its
a
trick
wait
a
while
after
a
sip
and
be
bamboozled
by
bitterness
ogreat
malty
red
especially
considering
the
abv
it
is
dangerously
sessionable
the
texture
was
hearty
and
very
little
bitterness
pours
tall
into
my
sam
smith
goblet
the
lacing
just
wont
quit
it
keeps
clinging
to
the
sides
the
body
colors
a
perfect
amber
the
scent
is
what
really
distinguishes
it
from
the
finest
euro
ales
piney
hops
blast
through
and
then
roll
into
molasses
the
flavor
rolls
from
pineapple
to
fig
picking
up
untouched
sugar
cane
and
evergreen
forest
theres
a
little
alcohol
burn
to
warn
you
worth
seeking
out
about
4
months
after
bottling
o
a
real
winner
in
the
lagunitas
lineup
although
it
has
a
touch
too
much
molassessugar
overdoing
it
on
the
sugar
doesnt
decrease
the
intensity
of
alcohol
present
if
that
was
the
objective
it
simply
covers
up
the
hops
at
least
for
my
palette
besides
that
a
fantastic
brew
that
is
worth
your
time
hoppy
woody
and
pretty
well
refined
the
flavors
in
this
brew
go
well
together
just
a
pinch
less
sugar
a
sipper
a
beer
to
savor
tasty
and
full
flavored
becoming
elegant
as
it
warms
a
treat
on
a
warm
summer
night
but
this
is
also
a
beer
that
could
hold
its
own
in
the
dead
of
winter
this
is
a
great
beer
the
blend
of
hops
barley
and
malt
work
beautifully
to
cover
the
alcohol
and
you
could
easily
down
more
than
a
few
without
knowing
that
you
are
the
suspect
of
the
undercover
shutdown
first
time
i
had
it
i
got
arrested
for
standing
on
the
train
tracks
but
thats
another
story
i
thought
this
beer
was
done
well
for
the
abv
its
not
too
heavy
but
it
has
that
slight
burn
that
lets
you
know
not
to
drink
it
too
fast
o
a
nice
brew
from
the
lag
i
like
it
but
its
heavy
wonderful
barleywine
style
ale
nice
pale
appearence
and
hoppy
aroma
an
excellent
balance
of
malt
and
hops
strong
enough
to
give
you
a
nice
slap
in
the
face
a
solid
strong
ale
excellent
value
at
only
9
99
a
six
pack
could
sell
at
10
99
a
four
pack
in
todays
qe3
economy
will
try
to
emualte
via
homebrew
lagunitas
all
the
way
a
wild
but
approachable
ale
chock
full
of
tasty
goodness
nice
complexity
good
balance
between
malt
hops
and
abv
definitely
a
big
beer
yet
easily
approachable
especially
if
high
abv
gives
you
pause
overall
a
balanced
and
very
soothing
brew
with
a
nice
blend
of
sweet
hop
malt
and
a
great
thickness
to
boot
rather
enjoyable
overall
id
say
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
but
the
burnt
flavors
arent
my
thing
lighten
this
up
a
bit
and
id
enjoy
it
a
whole
lot
better
good
not
great
p
p
s
o
huge
hop
nose
and
massive
bittering
hops
on
the
palate
with
a
sticky
and
sweet
caramel
malt
backbone
for
my
personal
preference
the
hops
overpower
the
beer
this
was
probably
the
intent
and
to
that
end
it
is
successful
it
is
just
a
bit
out
of
balance
for
me
notes
solid
strong
ale
more
malty
than
hoppy
but
there
is
a
significant
hop
presence
hints
of
alcohol
but
nothing
too
outrageous
overall
it
is
a
fairly
balanced
strong
ale
with
a
bold
yet
balanced
flavor
nice
beer
particularly
for
the
price
but
nothing
amazing
wow
a
great
ipa
a
little
bit
creamy
and
a
tad
on
the
heavier
side
simple
yet
robust
flavor
just
about
exactly
what
i
look
for
in
an
ipa
drink
2
of
these
and
im
golden
solid
a
beer
would
buy
again
and
again
pours
a
rich
copper
and
has
a
nice
lacing
must
try
for
an
ipa
lover
o
a
bit
too
sweet
and
the
the
alcohol
hitalmost
like
vodkagives
it
a
cough
syrup
taste
its
fine
for
a
summer
beer
but
ill
pass
next
time
o
pegged
as
a
strong
ale
but
reminiscent
of
an
american
barleywine
this
beer
is
well
executed
showcasing
wonderful
and
synergistic
malt
and
hop
characteristics
in
the
big
brother
is
watching
age
that
we
live
in
this
beer
is
a
reminds
us
that
we
can
still
be
true
to
ourselves
o
a
highly
drinkable
ale
with
big
malt
and
hop
character
lots
of
flavor
and
unique
flavor
profile
in
the
end
the
beer
is
still
has
too
much
alcohol
feel
caramel
and
candy
sweetness
o
its
borderline
sensory
overload
and
i
love
it
pours
a
richer
copper
amber
combo
color
clear
and
inviting
halfinch
of
fluffy
offwhite
head
mix
of
malts
and
hops
in
the
initial
smell
malts
are
up
front
and
hit
the
palate
high
with
hops
providing
reinforcement
alcohol
complements
the
other
flavors
nicely
but
this
belies
the
actual
distinct
and
pleasant
mouthfeel
no
overpowering
but
hard
to
ignore
o
an
excellent
sipper
just
a
great
beer
full
of
malty
goodness
and
that
lagunitas
hop
touch
that
i
have
no
problem
taking
some
time
with
undercover
investigation
offers
all
the
typical
lagunitas
flavors
with
a
big
booze
punch
far
too
easy
to
drink
this
huge
beer
dreamy
copperbrown
color
lightsnowy
head
and
bloomy
lacing
smells
of
brown
sugar
sweet
malt
and
citrusy
hops
tastes
stronger
than
youd
expect
more
malt
comes
through
than
hops
but
it
finds
a
way
to
maintain
an
earthy
presence
while
remaining
balanced
this
is
a
punchy
ale
and
theres
no
hiding
that
high
abv
in
its
fullbody
finish
is
sweet
and
thin
exactly
what
youd
want
in
a
strong
ale
and
a
fine
alternative
for
a
frequent
dipa
drinker
overall
this
beer
is
very
sweet
unlike
what
i
expected
from
their
virtual
taste
video
that
they
published
on
youtube
i
was
expecting
it
to
be
pretty
bitter
however
im
surprised
this
beer
is
9
7
abv
because
there
is
no
alcohol
presence
in
the
taste
this
is
a
really
good
sweet
beer
that
will
pair
excellent
with
any
spicy
food
overall
a
great
hoppy
sweet
beer
from
lagunitas
i
would
buy
again
the
sweetness
and
hoppiness
is
very
well
balanced
and
the
alcohol
is
not
too
noticeable
one
of
my
favorites
from
them
really
good
strong
hoppy
ale
most
similar
to
an
imperialdouble
ipa
to
me
definitely
worth
trying
and
would
have
it
again
really
not
that
impressed
by
this
one
ive
had
many
better
beers
by
them
this
is
pretty
much
a
less
sweeter
version
and
lower
abv
version
of
brown
shugga
with
that
said
i
dont
understand
why
its
a
springtime
release
id
probably
appreciate
this
a
lot
more
if
it
were
cold
out
medium
thickness
with
oily
hop
textures
surprised
at
the
lack
of
alcohol
present
for
the
high
abv
but
it
is
well
hidden
overall
i
really
like
this
brew
will
definitely
seek
out
some
more
and
recommend
to
friends
overall
this
comes
off
as
just
a
big
solid
and
controlled
hoppy
amber
to
me
more
than
a
strong
ale
and
that
appeals
greatly
to
me
real
well
put
together
brew
and
love
the
mix
of
fruit
and
dank
earth
hop
profile
on
this
as
well
o
this
beer
is
awesome
it
comes
very
close
to
the
dipa
side
of
the
spectrum
as
it
is
very
hopforward
but
the
extra
sweet
malts
and
spices
make
it
more
than
that
it
is
very
tasty
and
definitely
drinkable
especially
given
the
abv
it
has
a
nice
smooth
burn
from
the
alcohol
and
tons
of
flavor
i
highly
recommend
this
one
o
i
would
highly
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
even
if
they
are
apprehensive
of
hops
overpowering
their
beer
and
as
i
stress
once
again
9
6
alcohol
itll
get
the
job
done
well
done
lagunitas
you
have
yourselves
another
winner
overall
this
is
a
good
barleywine
offering
from
lagunitas
im
impressed
by
the
balance
offered
here
o
wonderful
beer
im
very
pleased
with
this
had
this
one
on
tap
a
couple
times
before
finally
getting
around
to
review
this
served
in
a
snifter
with
a
finger
of
white
sticky
creamy
head
this
beer
is
a
bit
murky
and
amber
with
plenty
of
orange
highlights
aromas
of
hops
aplenty
citrus
and
herbal
malt
is
biscuity
with
caramel
a
marmalade
character
to
this
beer
taste
is
malty
and
sweet
with
a
hoppy
backdrop
that
is
similar
to
the
aroma
with
a
fair
amount
of
resin
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
slick
in
the
finish
and
a
bit
warming
a
heavy
malt
bill
that
is
a
bit
cloying
alcohol
in
the
finish
but
not
vapory
in
the
mouth
overall
this
is
a
solid
brew
that
doesnt
offend
or
jump
out
at
me
nice
beer
given
the
high
alcohol
12
ounce
bottle
into
tulip
glass
bottled
on

pours
moderately
cloudy
orange
copper
color
with

with
great
retention
that
reduces
to

with

that
does
not
overpower
the

flavors
with
zero

and
mediumfull

with
a

and
moderately
sticky
mouthfeel
that
is
great
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
with
only
a
small
warming
noticed
after
the
finish
overall
this
is
a
highly
excellent
hoppy
strong
ale
great
hop
flavor
complexity
and
moderate
malt
balance
and
very
smooth
to
drink
for
the
abv
a
highly
enjoyable
offering
overall
fantastic
expertly
balanced
not
the
hopbomb
i
was
expecting
but
thats
not
a
bad
thing
at
all
its
a
shame
this
is
a
limited
release
because
i
would
get
this
all
the
time
otherwise
if
you
see
it
you
should
grab
it
o
a
stellar
beer
greater
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
supremely
drinkable
at
9
6abv
and
66
ibu
this
should
be
around
all
year
long
i
really
like
this
beer
has
a
hoppy
floral
aroma
that
you
dont
really
expect
on
a
beer
this
dark
the
malt
dominates
the
flavor
with
great
hop
flavor
balancing
throughout
definitely
a
beer
i
would
buy
again
o
not
one
of
lagunitas
best
efforts
i
really
like
their
overall
lineup
as
they
are
one
of
my
favorite
brewers
but
this
one
is
not
one
and
will
not
be
purchased
by
me
again
o
not
that
this
is
too
much
to
handle
but
the
alcohol
burn
is
just
a
little
overpowering
to
the
other
flavors
of
the
beer
otherwise
fantastic
just
a
little
off
balance
imo
o
pretty
tasty
now
this
is
good
a
highly
complex
and
yet
perfectly
balanced
american
barley
wine
i
wish
i
had
another
bottle
overall
this
stuff
is
drinkable
but
i
dont
think
ill
pick
up
another
sixer
anytime
soon
its
a
big
beer
i
can
only
drink
five
or
six
today
more
accurately
tonight
o
i
felt
like
i
was
drinking
stone
double
bastard
the
whole
time
but
this
one
is
a
bit
different
and
infinitely
cheaper
d
a
terrific
american
strong
ale
more
hops
than
malt
but
still
quite
tasty
another
rock
solid
offering
from
lagunitas
packs
a
bit
of
a
punch
with
its
9
7
layers
of
depth
and
complexity
in
every
facet
highly
recommend
and
a
definite
bargain
at
its
fairly
low
price
lagunitas
you
guys
always
swing
for
the
fences
and
you
almost
always
connect
at
9
abv
this
is
easy
to
drink
even
though
the
alcohol
presence
is
noticeable
this
beer
looks
strong
smells
of
candy
and
alcohol
and
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
leave
you
wanting
more
another
great
beer
in
the
lagunitas
lineup
but
definitely
a
notch
or
two
below
sucks
and
a
little
sumpin
big
strong
beer
had
out
of
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glad
lots
of
booze
decent
color
with
a
soft
flat
head
good
looking
american
ale
copper
color
big
aroma
of
hops
and
sugary
fruit
you
can
as
other
have
noted
taste
the
alcohol
the
mouthfeel
has
a
good
deal
of
carbonation
and
a
bit
of
spice
o
this
is
an
awesome
beer
for
a
9
6
it
seems
like
a
7
58
its
only
10
for
a
6
pack
and
extremely
tasty
one
of
the
top
5
beers
i
have
had
i
will
be
getting
a
case
of
this
for
sure
to
cellar
some
of
it
o
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
american
strong
ale
not
my
favorite
by
lagunitas
but
that
isnt
saying
much
because
they
generally
kick
ass
o
i
picked
up
this
beer
completely
blind
based
on
my
love
of
all
the
lagunitas
products
that
ive
had
this
one
was
much
maltier
and
much
boozier
than
i
expected
i
would
not
buy
it
again
and
will
be
more
careful
about
selecting
brews
blindly
based
on
previous
experience
i
still
rate
lagunitas
as
my
3rd
favorite
brewery
o
solid
and
tasty
it
also
tastes
like
what
i
would
expect
from
a
lagunitas
brew
o
this
and
brown
shugga
are
two
very
perplexing
beers
both
are
so
intense
with
the
sweetness
and
alcohol
while
the
hops
just
assault
away
at
the
same
time
complex
but
not
really
im
probably
gonna
let
my
sixpack
sit
for
a
while
so
the
hops
and
booze
calm
down
a
bit
o
great
looking
beer
that
has
a
great
aroma
too
taste
was
not
bad
the
style
is
american
strong
ale
a
catchall
beer
category
which
may
be
a
subcategory
of
an
american
ipa
the
beer
tastes
like
an
ipa
to
me
hop
pungency
and
bitterness
regardless
of
the
style

this
beer
is
a
step
backwards
in

it
looks
like
a

generic
yeast

on

will

what

can

about

tingly

sticky
on

pretty
decent
flavor
but
probably
not
one
id
seek
out
again
in

near

notchucknorrisapr

but
it
is
well
integrated
into
the
rich
malt
profile
and
somehow
the
bitterness
is
restrained
lagunitas
calls
this
an
imperial
mild
not
sure
if
that
is
a
joke
or
not
thats
my
goto
when
im
not
sure
what
i
smell
the
taste
is
strong

goes
nicely

attention
the
aromas
that
come
from
this
brew
were
floral
hopped

a

malty

imperial

liquid
with
an

plenty

i

that
i
may
be

to

for
other

the

high

i
came
on

site
nothing
too
outstanding

this
is
still
another

brew
from

the

is

anyway
its
categorized
here
as
a
strong
ale
just
hoppy
and
sweet
but
the
flavor
lands
closer
to
imperial

due
to
the
soft

subsequent
hoppy

okay
the

the

was
finding
the

level
itd
be

to
easy
to
drink
about
6
of
these
without
blinking

with
just
enough
hops
to
keep
it
appropriately

really
nice
find
d
good
would
have
been
better
if
the
alcohol
wasnt
so
prominent
overall
a
but
restrained
for
what
im
used
to
from
lagunitas
but
other
then
that
a
great
beer
flavorful
enough
to
drink
several
underwhelming
compared
to
the
rest
of
this
brewerys
lineup
do
i
have
a
problem
if
i
consider
this
sessionable
moreys
bottom
line
if
youre
a
fan
of
the
style
this
is
a
must
try
a
well
made
beer
without
a
doubt
for
me
its
a
bit
sweet
though
another
solid
beer
from
lagunitas
a
bit
too
sweet
and
boozy
for
my
tastes
but
otherwise
not
bad
at
all
m
d
sparkling
and
rather
assertive
carbonation
medium
body
with
a
slight
bit
of
chewiness
and
a
lasting
flavour
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
and
i
would
be
happy
to
have
another
i
could
drink
this
beer
a
lot
but
i
shouldnt
drink
a
lot
of
this
beer
if
that
makes
sense
its
boozey
but
the
flavor
and
smoothness
make
you
want
to
pound
quite
a
few
back
probably
not
a
good
idea
overall
the
alcohol
is
too
present
and
too
hot
flavors
take
a
back
seat
here
wont
have
again
love
this
one
drinkability
very
strong
and
confused
d
good
for
year
round
i
think
probably
is
food
friendly
too
the
abv
is
pushing
the
envelope
however
pours
a
reddish
brown
with
a
little
white
foam
forming
on
the
top
spiderweb
lacing
smells
of
piney
hops
some
hint
of
citrus
sweet
malt
flavor
is
a
strong
sweet
hoppy
smackdown
with
pine
cane
sugar
and
caramel
sticky
and
syrupy
but
in
a
way
that
makes
me
think
of
hop
resins
so
i
guess
thats
ok
a
bit
messy
and
a
bit
over
the
top
with
the
hops
though
it
manages
to
approach
some
kind
of
balance
because
the
malt
and
alcohol
are
why
out
there
too
this
is
about
what
i
expect
from
lagunitas
good
not
great
but
worthwhile
usually
a
fantastic
american
strongle
aledipa
that
deserves
more
recognition
than
its
getting
another
sugar
bomb
a
marshmellow
merengue
head
floats
atop
a
burnt
amber
body
the
aroma
is
faint
but
cookies
and
hop
spice
jump
out
the
pint
the
body
is
crisp
for
a
heavy

thick

toward
the
end
the

to
scrub

but
i
wont
be
stopping
by
for
another
clear
amber
with
fizzy

but
a
bit

can
be
rather
annoying
recommended
i
was
lucky
enough
to
have
experienced
this
sneak
release
it
was
great
a
nice
double
hopped
i
p
a
a
little
more
carbonated
than
i
would
have
liked
but
no
biggie
the
story
behind
it
is
cool
and
i
feel
honored
to
have
gotten
to
try
it
i
bought
three
six
packs
of
it
so
if
anyone
wants
some
within
the
next
month
or
so
then
let
me
know
by
far
one
of
the
best
beer
surprises
ive
had
in
awhile
overall
im
really
enjoying
this
one
this
is
something
ill
definitely
be
picking
up
another
six
pack
of
no
alcahol
warming
at
the
knose
or
in
the
taste
outstanding
beer
overall
impression
dangerous
the
alcohol
definitely
isnt
hidden
but
its
smooth
and
flavorful
i
could
drink
several
of
these
but
it
would
probably
be
a
bad
idea
very
nice
well
done
but
dont
think
i
could
have
more
than
one
are
mild
supposed
to
be
9not
sure
not
sure
drinkability
is
hindered
only
by
the
strength
its
a
great
beer
that
i
will
probabaly
be
buying
another
sixpack
of
just
to
see
how
it
ages
a
good
dipa
but
seems
just
a
little
thin
for
the
style
however
its
highly
drinkable
which
is
a
little
dangerous
for
this
one
considering
its
9abv
proceed
with
caution
recommended
a
world
class
beer
overall
this
was
easy
to
put
down
and
enjoyable
some
will
argue
this
is
a
well
balanced
double
ipa
and
i
hear
ya
but
i
am
one
who
wants
a
hopsforward
ipa
not
a
maltforward
one
but
to
each
their
own
drinkability
an
interesting
and
pleasant
beer
heavy
and
dense
with
tons
of
residual
sugar
and
tropical
citrusty
piney
notes
as
many
of
the
lagunitas
beers
are
it
definitely
doesnt
feel
like
9
28
abv
though
so
i
gotta
give
it
that
either
way
id
have
liked
to
try
this
one
in
its
fresh
state
alas
nonetheless
many
many
thanks
to
numbeercruncher
this
is
a
solid
tasty
beer
delicious
malty
hoppy
everything
a
good
beer
should
be
interesting
beer
pours
clear
mahogany
with
a
decent
but
shortlived
head
floral
hoppy
aroma
with
pine
and
nuts
leads
you
to
believe
this
will
be
more
on
the
imperial
red
side
its
not
lots
of
malt
and
caramel
with
some
woodiness
the
hops
are
there
but
very
tempered
almost
run
over
by
the
malt
in
the
end
this
is
still
pretty
good
prosit
mk
d
the
abv
was
fairly
well
hidden
making
this
a
moderate
drinking
dipa
liked
it
but
to
closely
resembled
their
other
beers
to
truly
stand
out
by
itself
and
be
different
a
delicious
brew
that
is
hoppy
yet
wellbalanced
a
nicely
done
drinkable
dipa
non
the
less
a
very
special
brew
d
pretty
decent
not
the
best
example
of
a
double
but
certainly
worth
a
try
for
the
price
pretty
sure
this
bomber
was
less
than
5
its
a
great
deal
if
you
are
a
fan
of
really
big
brews
however
i
would
recommend
this
one
d
honestly
im
kind
of
feeling
it
after
one
its
delicious
and
well
balanced
so
i
highly
recommend
it
though
moderately
and
carefully
ill
limit
myself
to
one
or
two
a
month
poured
into
a
snifter
very
nice
tan
head
with
good
retention
gorgeous
reddish
amber
color
with
a
nice
halo
effect
after
the
head
settles
very
nice
lacing
as
well
sweet
rich
malty
aroma
with
lead
fruits
such
as
apples
figs
and
raisins
covered
with
a
strong
alcohol
aroma
this
beer
has
aged
some
the
extra
time
mellowed
this
one
out
perfectly
flavors
of
figs
and
raisins
with
some
spice
very
complex
palate
a
little
fruity
but
it
is
still
a
kick
ass
brew
the
mouthfeel
is
unbelievably
smooth
with
a
low
to
mild
carbonation
level
beautiful
palate
overall
this
beer
was
great
the
first
day
i
had
it
but
the
aging
just
makes
this
outstanding
undercover
investigation
shutdown
ale
that
just
rolls
off
the
tongue
is
a
great
beer
and
very
drinkable
for
being
9
one
of
the
better
brews
to
come
out
of
lagunitas
this
hefty
red
should
become
a
staple
of
their
lineup
you
heard
it
here
first
folks
big
body
very
viscous
great
mouthfeel
and
highly
drinkable
wish
i
had
the
whole
bomber
to
myself
today
toast
comes
to
mind
and
breadyness
caramel
and
biscuit
malt
is
impresing
me
more
than
the
hops
butthe
bitterness
is
there
wonderful
changeofpace
brew
if
you
are
used
to
drinking
the
western
american
pales
and
ipas
imagine
the
understated
sweetness
of
a
dogfish
head
90
coupled
with
the
punchy
finish
of
a
quality
barleywine
style
i
have
no
experience
with
this
brewery
but
this
offering
will
definitely
get
me
to
try
a
few
others
is
there
a
more
sessionable
dipa
out
there
probably
not
should
this
beer
even
be
classfied
as
a
dipa
probably
not
it
characteristics
are
more
akin
to
that
of
a
barleywine
or
a
strong
ale
but
no
matter
how
one
may
choose
to
describe
it
its
a
damn
fine
brew
overall
a
nice
effort
which
might
have
veered
a
bit
toward
old
alestrong
ale
or
barleywine
during
an
eight
month
hiatus
as
it
was
lost
in
my
cellar
with
a
few
friends
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
am
really
starting
to
love
lagunitas
as
more
of
it
becomes
available
in
my
area
thank
you
lagunitas
you
never
disappoint
a
beer
to
definitely
try
drinkability
is
good
i
drank
this
one
way
too
fast
because
it
was
so
tasty
not
a
session
beer
by
any
means
but
a
very
enjoyable
experience
pours
a
gorgeous
rich
mahagony
color
with
some
nice
lasting
white
head
smell
is
pretty
nice
and
hoppy
with
a
slight
touch
of
malt
perhaps
and
a
bit
of
noticeable
alcohol
present
especially
as
it
warms
some
moderately
bittered
for
the
style
and
is
nicely
hopped
but
the
noticeable
alcohol
taste
rather
is
what
caused
me
to
not
like
it
too
much
finish
is
mild
lasting
bitterness
and
chest
warming
alcohol
i
dont
like
tasting
the
alcohol
in
my
beer
this
much
md
now
that
i
see
this
is
a
dipa
it
makes
a
bit
more
sense
rather
nice
and
easy
to
drink
a
bit
harsh
at
first
but
finishes
nicely
very
clear
orangeamber
beer
with
a
large
offwhite
head
head
lingers
and
leaves
lace
to
the
last
sip
aroma
is
hoppy
but
well
balanced
with
malt
and
crystal
notes
plus
significant
but
soft
alcohol
notes
flavor
is
very
hoppy
but
again
with
a
good
malt
backbone
to
balance
it
out
mouthfeel
is
on
the
high
side
of
medium
tail
lingers
well
with
a
nice
hoppy
character
but
with
some
faint
apple
notes
drinkability
i
had
to
ramp
the
drinkability
and
mouthfeel
on
this
one
it
went
uphill
by
leaps
and
bounds
giving
more
than
i
ever
expected
this
beer
to
on
par
with
other
hoppy
offerings
by
lagunitas
but
this
is
one
of
the
higher
rating
ones
from
the
moment
you
pour
this
beer
you
know
its
going
to
be
a
bit
different
the
amber
color
the
offwhite
creamythick
head
the
sweet
yet
hoppy
nose
and
then
the
taste
its
not
at
all
like
an
ipa
in
my
opinion
no
way
ipas
smack
your
taste
buds
with
piney
resin
flavors
and
bitterness
and
this
is
sweet
malty
mellow
sweetness
with
a
touch
of
hops
and
alcohol
to
balance
it
out
to
me
this
beer
is
the
perfect
balance
of
malt
hop
and
alcohol
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
if
i
could
only
get
my
hands
on
more
of
em
due
to
the
lack
of
hoppiness
and
prevalence
of
layered
maltiness
i
would
venture
to
guess
this
sample
might
not
have
been
so
fresh
lagunitas
sneak
release
undercover
investigation
shutdown
ale
pours
a
clear
orange
red
with
a
nice
creamy
head
that
lingers
for
quite
a
while
from
the
moment
i
opened
the
bottle
i
was
hit
with
big
citrusy
hop
aroma
grapefruit
and
pine
backed
up
with
a
good
amount
of
malt
sweetness
the
sweetness
is
predominate
in
the
flavor
lots
of
caramel
and
toffee
but
there
is
no
lack
of
citrusy
hop
flavor
there
is
a
nice
bitterness
that
rounds
out
the
beer
but
not
overpowering
for
the
beers
strength
a
bit
of
alcohol
comes
through
in
the
finish
but
not
too
much
for
a
beer
of
the
strength
sheesh
whata
tasty
beer

im
very
pleased
to
see
that
this
one
is
now
a
rotating
release
one
of
if
not
the
best
beer
i
have
had
in
the
past
6
months
i
have
nothing
bad
to
say
about
it
also
great
with
food
i
had
it
with
some
steak
the
story
behind
it
is
what
got
my
attention
and
i
knew
i
had
to
try
it
the
taste
is
not
too
hoppy
but
its
presence
is
definitely
there
color
is
a
rich
amber
red
with
a
good
frothy
head
please
try
this
beer
its
worth
it
a
nice
beer
great
woody
hops
nice
balance
a
good
offering
from
lagunitas
hazy
scarlet
red
appearance
thin
dirty
white
head
lace
is
weblike
and
quite
intricate
aroma
is
of
juicy
plump
hop
nuances
as
well
as
thick
caramel
malt
tones
first
sip
contains
alcohol
biting
hops
and
big
caramel
malt
the
alcohol
smooths
out
as
it
warms
and
the
juicy
hop
flavor
come
out
more
the
bitterness
is
just
right
for
a
dipa
this
is
very
nicely
balanced
for
a
dipa
but
hops
and
bitterness
still
rule
medium
full
body
and
moderately
carbonated
this
ones
going
down
too
damn
fast
what
a
steal
for
3
99
a
bomber
heads
up
to
lagunitas
for
delivering
yet
another
unique
brew
i
may
have
to
pick
up
a
few
bottles
to
stash
in
my
cellar
a
redamber
lots
of
very
puffy
head
very
active
carbonation
moderate
lacing
s
really
enticing
sweet
up
front
with
a
lot
of
earthy
hops
t
very
robust
but
really
nicely
balanced
much
like
the
smell
its
got
a
lot
of
malt
up
front
but
its
followed
closely
by
some
really
delicious
hops
the
finish
is
pretty
incredible
sort
of
like
an
emmentaler
or
gruyere
m
pretty
coarse
thick
and
chewy
d
all
in
all
a
really
wonderful
iipa
i
almost
question
the
style
designation
its
definitely
hoppy
but
its
by
no
means
overly
aggressive
but
whatever
it
is
its
a
wonderfully
balanced
enjoyable
delicious
beer
pours
an
orange
redish
color
with
a
sparkling
body
and
foamy
nice
light
brown
colored
head
smell
is
grape
sweet
malt
and
borders
on
a
little
of
a
barleywine
type
of
aroma
taste
is
of
honey
sweetness
with
a
little
bit
of
bitter
after
taste
crisp
carbonation
followed
by
a
warming
alcohol
presence
nice
beer
glad
they
were
not
shut
down
the
feel
is
thick
creamy
and
bubbly
leaves
a
thick
film
a
really
substantial
brew
really
delicious
and
though
its
heavy
its
a
fast
easy
drinker
recommended
if
you
can
still
find
this
anywhere
one
of
the
better
brews
i
have
had
from
lagunitas
and
definitely
gave
kill
ugly
radio
a
run
for
its
money
i
poured
this
big
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
50
degrees
this
beer
was
an
exciting
brew
it
was
a
bit
red
looking
with
a
nice
head
and
lacing
the
smell
was
nice
a
little
hoppy
but
very
nice
the
taste
was
a
little
bitt
little
hoppy
but
very
tolerable
a
bit
strong
this
beer
will
put
a
hurtin
on
you
for
sure
but
the
high
alcohol
did
not
wast
away
the
taste
so
i
will
have
to
say
i
would
buy
again
this
is
allaround
strong
strong
hops
strong
malts
strong
alcohol
its
a
nice
taste
but
one
is
more
than
enough
at
a
time
the
beer
makes
good
its
escape
from
the
22
ounce
bottle
a
cloudless
burnished
copper
the
head
perfection
the
color
light
tan
and
the
texture
creamy
upon
its
inevitable
demise
the
lace
forms
a
thick
glutinous
sheet
to
obfuscate
the
glass
nose
is
chockablock
with
the
hop
flowery
aroma
sweet
malt
supports
the
hops
hints
of
caramel
appetizing
nay
mouth
watering
i
say
start
has
a
pleasant
malt
profile
sweet
with
a
definite
hop
spicy
bitterness
at
the
back
top
is
middling
to
full
in
its
feel
to
the
palate
finish
continues
the
big
hop
spicy
bite
the
acidity
customary
the
aftertaste
dry
as
a
bleached
desert
bone
my
oh
my
if
this
aint
a
great
beer
then
im
a
teetotaler
and
we
know
that
aint
so
lol
d
a
solid
iipa
ill
take
some
more
the
taste
is
a
very
good
blend
of
hops
and
malts
stronger
on
the
hops
side
with
some
good
strong
bitterness
i
detect
a
slight
alcohol
burn
but
not
over
the
top
it
increases
as
it
warms
this
beer
is
excellent
and
has
a
very
nice
medium
body
the
taste
is
smooth
and
sweet
with
caramel
and
toffee
malts
paving
the
way
its
not
nearly
as
hoppy
as
i
wouldve
liked
after
all
it
is
a
dipa
but
the
finish
produced
a
decent
bitterness
body
is
semiviscous
and
perfectly
carbonated
with
a
decent
bite
that
makes
you
perk
up
and
take
note
i
cant
say
id
seek
out
this
one
again
as
there
are
many
better
double
ipas
out
there
but
it
does
go
down
smoothly
and
drinks
amazingly
well
overall
finally
a
lagunitas
specialtyseasonal
that
i
can
love
delicious
american
barleywineamerican
strong
ale
solid
in
almost
every
way
this
is
perhaps
the
best
lagunitas
ive
ever
had
and
you
can
see
from
my
reviews
that
ive
had
a
lot
double
ipa
huh
my
first
thoughts
were
that
it
was
a
lighter
barley
with
a
touch
of
cocoa
it
actually
appears
a
bit
like
a
dark
amber
and
the
malts
are
sweet
and
fruity
and
like
i
said
theres
a
touch
of
chocolate
flavor
the
hops
didnt
seem
that
big
citrus
and
peppery
but
not
nearly
as
big
as
great
divides
hercules
dipa
for
a
dipa
it
leaves
hops
to
be
desired
for
a
strong
ale
its
pretty
cool
d
excellently
balanced
beer
hops
and
malts
at
perfect
harmony
which
is
my
favorite
kind
of
beer
highly
recommended
tastes
of
sweet
malt
then
the
hoppy
piny
bitterness
hits
you
has
a
good
clean
bitter
finish
that
holds
on
a
great
beer
to
sip
on
as
the
alcohol
is
very
warming
but
not
that
evident
on
my
palate
highly
recommended
if
you
see
it
pick
it
up
and
take
it
home
this
is
the
sneak
release
not
the
12th
anniversary
edition
wouldnt
put
this
in
the
ipa
or
iipa
genera
id
like
it
in
the
strong
ale
category
yes
it
is
a
hoppy
beer
but
the
spice
profile
in
the
malts
give
this
a
big
big
boost
not
as
good
as
mendicinos
eye
of
the
hawk
but
better
than
stones
arrogant
bastard
a
bit
chalky
on
the
palate
nice
buzz
though
good
but
i
wouldnt
rave
about
it
overall
another
great
beer
by
lagunitas
for
4
a
bomber
their
beers
can
not
be
beat
i
spent
the
day
relaxing
at
the
beach
and
upon
coming
back
inside
the
beach
house
i
popped
this
one
open
it
was
so
smooth
and
refreshing
i
think
i
may
now
lay
down
and
take
a
nap
im
gonna
throw
a
maximus
in
the
fridge
it
would
be
perfect
this
evening
while
enjoying
one
of
west
coast
floridas
most
beautiful
sunsets
from
a
chaise
lounger
on
longboat
key
if
im
not
unconscious
by
then
i
may
just
be
inclined
to
drink
their
newest
release
kill
ugly
radio
as
i
think
about
my
wonderful
day
and
what
else
lies
ahead
during
my
holiday
birthday
weekend
at
the
beach
overall
i
really
liked
it
i
am
not
sure
that
it
fits
in
the
genera
in
which
it
was
placed
here
but
definitely
worth
a
try
lagunitas
sneak
release
undercover
investigation
shutdown
ale
pours
a
dark
reddish
copper
color
with
an
of
white
head
from
a
brown
twenty
two
ounce
bottle
the
aroma
is
a
bit
milder
than
i
would
like
it
is
primarily
hops
there
is
a
strong
hop
flavor
up
front
that
fades
to
a
strong
malt
flavor
toward
the
end
pretty
decent
worth
a
try
enjoyable
brew
for
sure
but
not
my
favorite
dipa
and
i
should
point
out
that
the
label
never
refers
to
it
as
an
ipa
or
double
ipa
only
an
especially
bitter
ale
im
really
not
even
sure
its
a
dipa
it
shares
some
characteristics
but
its
got
more
malt
flavor
and
less
hop
flavor
than
most
dipas
definitely
worth
a
try
though
considering
the
price
tag
is
a
bit
in
some
cases
quite
lower
than
other
dipas
definitely
something
i
would
get
again
perhaps
not
a
classic
but
a
solid
drinkable
american
strong
for
sure
overall
more
hoppy
than
malty
that
is
a
rare
occasion
for
a
dipa
nowadays
it
seems
very
good
highly
recommended
d
balanced
and
warm
dipa
that
is
smooth
drinking
the
abv
is
very
wellmasked
not
the
hoppiest
dipa
but
a
solid
entrant
in
this
category
this
is
a
good
solid
beer
but
it
failed
to
wow
me
theres
not
really
anything
terribly
unique
or
distinctive
about
it
its
still
very
good
and
pretty
cheap
i
may
get
it
again
if
the
mood
strikes
me
recommended
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
a
1
beige
head
over
the
clear
coppery
amber
brew
head
lasts
well
with
tons
of
sticky
lace
froth
aroma
is
fresh
citrusy
hops
with
twinges
of
pine
as
well
taste
is
ample
maltiness
to
start
which
is
quickly
balanced
and
overpowered
a
bit
by
the
dominant
hops
flavor
particularly
the
pine
lingers
and
there
is
warming
after
toughts
as
well
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
prickly
due
to
the
strength
of
hops
character
but
this
one
remains
plenty
drinkable
this
is
a
very
accomplished
and
polished
double
ipa
and
a
nice
spin
on
a
style
that
many
believe
has
just
one
note
characteristically
it
appears
very
much
like
a
red
deep
amber
in
color
with
a
finger
head
that
laces
quite
nicely
theres
a
lot
more
malt
than
your
traditional
dipa
theres
plenty
of
hops
there
too
seems
like
it
should
be
a
strong
ale
again
fuck
it
its
a
good
beer
enjoy
one
drinkability
kind
of
a
slow
sipping
beer
here
as
the
alcohol
is
high
and
the
bitterness
is
bold
definitely
worth
giving
this
a
shot
for
3
99
per
22oz
bottle
you
cant
go
wrong
with
lagunitas
picked
this
up
at
casanovas
in
wisconsinif
its
a
dipa
i
must
try
it
this
was
a
tasty
beer
but
reminds
me
more
of
a
barleywinemore
sweetness
and
maltiness
than
many
dipas
but
quite
good
i
am
personally
a
fan
dark
beers
the
muddier
the
better
i
do
enjoy
this
beer
a
great
deal
i
recommend
a
try
good
stuff
to
start
the
weekend
after
a
long
work
week
hopefully
its
all
uphill
from
here
22
oz
bottle
pours
a
clear
dark
copper
with
a
beige
head
the
aroma
contains
a
moderate
amount
of
nice
floral
hops
the
first
sip
is
a
little
sweet
however
it
contains
a
solid
caramel
malt
backbone
that
quickly
turns
to
hops
and
finishes
with
a
good
strong
hop
flavor
grapefruit
pine
and
earthy
hops
carry
through
to
the
finish
the
pine
and
grapefruit
flavor
lingers
in
the
aftertaste
for
quite
awhile
the
9
28
abv
is
well
disguised
beneath
the
hops
this
beer
exhibits
a
medium
body
with
moderate
carbonation
and
could
pack
a
wallop
if
too
many
are
consumed
raw
and
delicious
a
best
choice
for
the
price
3
99
and
the
complexity
hope
i
can
get
my
hands
and
the
real
deal
soon
cheers
i
have
recently
enjoyed
kicking
off
the
night
of
sampling
different
beers
with
one
or
two
of
these
bombers
sure
there
is
a
decent
amount
of
alcohol
in
it
but
the
complex
taste
of
this
release
allows
the
average
beer
advocate
enthusiast
to
savor
the
beer
and
keep
from
downing
it
too
quick
at
only
3
99
a
bomber
lagunitas
continually
impresses
me
with
their
outstanding
and
consistent
releases
another
lagunitas
beer
i
miss
hahaha
another
great
beer
from
lagunitas
excellent
o
complex
with
variety
in
flavor
and
unique
not
something
id
reach
for
often
but
once
on
a
rare
occasion
overall
another
good
beer
from
lagunitus
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
medium
bodied
and
is
pretty
drinkable
but
does
not
seem
to
be
as
balanced
as
intended
it
goes
down
pretty
well
little
effort
with
a
little
age
this
beer
would
even
out
and
could
be
really
fantastic
the
hops
would
mellow
a
little
and
the
malts
would
be
showcased
better
o
good
not
great
but
it
may
just
be
be
while
well
built
and
drinkable
to
me
the
flavor
seems
a
little
off
this
was
my
first
taste
of
wtf
and
with
no
apparent
date
on
the
bottle
i
dont
know
if
its
me
or
the
brew
ill
have
to
give
it
another
go
over
all
this
is
a
nice
strong
brown
ale
a
little
more
bitter
than
most
brown
ales
that
i
have
had
however
this
beer
has
a
nice
balance
and
i
would
recommend
it
for
a
football
game
beverage
o
a
damn
good
imperial
brown
well
balanced
smooth
not
too
sweet
another
brew
well
done
by
lagunitas
overall
an
excellent
brown
ale
different
than
the
typical
malty
brew
grapefruit
sweetness
and
vanilla
combine
together
for
an
excellent
beer
overall
this
is
a
nice
sipper
balanced
and
pleasant
itd
be
good
with
roast
beef
or
pork
tenderloin
ham
sausage
or
maybe
even
some
rich
deserts
like
creme
brulee
with
berries
from
my
tasting
notes
lagunitas
says
its
a
brown
ale
but
in
pure
lagunitas
style
they
ratchet
up
the
hops
to
a
level
that
thoroughly
blurs
that
line
it
poured
a
copper
brown
with
a
malty
sweetness
on
the
aroma
with
a
hint
of
hops
the
taste
was
like
a
mixture
of
a
brown
ale
and
an
ipa
there
was
the
sweet
nuttiness
of
the
malt
balanced
by
the
signature
lagunitas
hop
bitterness
that
created
another
great
brew
the
body
was
full
and
helped
weigh
down
the
hoppy
profile
while
maintaining
its
high
drinkability
the
wtf
was
another
fine
beer
from
lagunitas
o
a
wonderfully
balanced
ale
great
taste
only
improves
as
it
warms
pours
mahogany
in
color
with
ruby
hues
where
the
light
pushes
through
an
inch
of
fluffy
white
head
develops
and
lingers
for
a
few
minutes
upon
settling
a
hearty
ring
of
bubbles
surrounds
the
surface
while
a
solid
dusting
covers
it
the
aroma
is
of
caramel
malt
earthy
hops
a
bit
of
spice
and
a
solid
dose
of
orangelemon
citrus
some
nuts
cashews
most
predominantly
toast
and
ubiquitous
dark
fruit
is
buried
in
there
as
well
it
tastes
of
citrus
a
suite
of
hops
bitter
earthen
and
spicy
all
appear
and
some
grass
up
front
quickly
the
more
robust
malts
push
through
and
caramel
toast
nuts
plum
and
a
bit
of
toffee
come
through
the
mouthfeel
is
initially
lightened
by
the
carbonation
but
becomes
viscous
sticky
and
resinous
before
too
long
finish
is
dry
overall
this
is
a
good
strong
ale
that
id
happily
drink
again
like
many
things
everything
from
lagunitas
there
are
a
ton
of
hops
here
and
they
play
nicely
with
the
maltier
base
i
dont
consider
myself
a
hophead
as
i
sometimes
think
that
hops
are
used
to
such
an
excessive
degree
as
to
mask
the
lovely
malt
flavors
however
i
think
the
brewer
has
achieved
an
excellent
balance
with
this
beer
which
is
similar
but
superior
to
their
brown
shugga
ale
that
i
sampled
last
winter
this
ale
tastes
full
with
malt
presence
and
yeast
fruitiness
with
some
dried
fruit
and
light
caramel
elements
with
mild
woody
accent
and
gentle
hops
in
the
background
i
like
how
the
mild
raisiny
flavor
from
the
dark
caramel
comes
through
with
some
rum
like
molasses
character
too
the
taste
has
some
citrus
flavor
from
the
hops
too
which
are
almost
tropical
like
a
ruby
red
grapefruit
near
the
last
taste
overall
this
is
a
really
flavorful
beer
which
i
was
pleased
to
try
i
wish
i
had
had
one
sooner
since
i
passed
by
it
before
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
with
great
balance
of
hop
and
malt
flavor
overall
i
would
recommend
this
beer
during
the
autumn
season
youre
not
sitting
by
the
pool
wanting
a
nice
crisp
ipa
but
youre
also
not
sitting
at
home
in
your
christmas
sweater
wanting
a
winter
warmer
or
a
stout
excellent
beer
though
pick
it
up
if
you
see
it
d
a
rather
interesting
brew
with
lots
of
pluses
and
a
couple
of
minuses
the
mouthfeel
proves
challenging
and
some
what
unappealing
this
one
lingers
in
the
no
mans
land
between
american
strong
ale
and
american
black
ale
the
end
result
is
nothing
more
than
an
interesting
merely
more
the
slightly
interesting
brew
overall
45
lagunitas
wilco
tango
foxtrot
is
one
of
those
weird
beers
that
exceeds
expectations
and
is
more
than
just
a
novelty
beer
the
hoppy
imperial
brown
ale
idea
really
does
work
in
practice
despite
the
doubts
of
narrowminded
purists
excellent
stuff
by
a
brewery
thats
never
afraid
to
step
outside
the
box
and
get
weird
with
it
o
tasty
beer
i
really
liked
the
aroma
and
enjoyed
the
beer
overall
would
definitely
buy
again
i
poured
this
outstanding
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
45
degrees
the
beer
was
auburn
colored
and
poured
a
really
big
head
the
head
was
nice
and
creamy
the
beer
smelled
a
little
hoppy
but
did
not
taste
too
hoppy
it
was
a
really
nice
beer
from
them
and
received
a
great
rating
in
my
book
i
would
certainly
buy
this
again
pours
ruby
brown
with
a
decent
head
that
fell
off
to
some
sticky
lace
crystal
clear
and
very
attractive
nose
is
lagunitas
hop
profile
all
the
way
spicy
rye
ripe
fruits
behind
that
and
pine
big
caramel
malt
some
bread
and
a
nice
touch
of
chocolate
to
tempt
the
palate
as
it
warms
you
can
notice
a
little
soy
quality
that
ultimately
detracts
taste
upfront
is
big
sweet
malt
the
rye
spiciness
and
some
toasted
bread
the
chocolate
is
very
nice
on
top
of
that
delicate
and
fruity
hops
come
in
with
some
bitter
and
oily
resin
to
coat
the
mouth
and
it
goes
down
easy
and
a
little
nutty
finishes
a
little
sticky
and
slightly
dry
its
a
plucky
little
ale
that
i
would
have
rated
higher
had
it
not
become
salty
after
a
while
and
had
it
not
tasted
so
very
similar
to
all
the
other
lagunitas
beers
this
actually
one
of
my
all
time
favorite
beers
i
think
lagunitas
does
a
great
job
in
general
with
all
their
beers
and
this
one
is
right
up
there
i
especially
like
how
they
got
this
to
taste
fresh
and
have
the
body
of
a
aged
beer
im
going
to
just
kick
back
now
and
enjoy
this
puppy
i
suggest
you
do
the
same
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
showed
a
beautiful
clear
copper
color
and
a
nice
2
12
finger
head
that
stayed
a
long
time
the
aroma
was
tell
tale
lagunitas
with
spicy
hops
front
and
center
taste
flashed
the
hops
and
took
it
to
citruspit
fruit
tang
that
i
love
from
the
brand
this
strong
ale
has
all
the
good
points
of
a
ipa
and
the
abv
of
a
barley
wine
solid
mouthfeel
that
lets
you
know
you
are
drinking
something
overall
im
glad
i
tried
this
and
always
grab
new
stuff
from
this
brand
prost
lampertland
o
an
enjoyable
7

abv
brew
at
the
less
than
5pre
tax
its
good
value
for
the
money
well
done
all
purpose
beer
i
will
enjoy
to
the
end
o
for
about
8
this
is
a
solid
strong
ale
bomber
purchase
its
not
quite
as
flavorful
as
double
bastard
or
velvet
hammer
but
itll
certainly
do
in
a
pinch
this
takes
their
other
strong
ales
and
puts
them
right
in
the
basket
for
me
at
the
price
of
4
this
is
a
ridiculously
difficult
offer
to
beat
its
all
over
the
place
in
terms
of
flavors
and
at
times
is
a
little
intimidating
to
finish
but
it
has
tremendous
shelf
life
and
definitely
could
reduce
any
heat
over
time
but
it
also
would
reduce
the
forward
citruspine
hop
profile
going
on
here
as
well
i
enjoy
it
fresh
although
some
time
sitting
around
as
settled
a
lot
of
the
intensity
great
stuff
yet
again
from
lagunitas
a
solid
offering
but
far
from
outstanding
neither
hoppy
nor
malty
enough
to
fully
commit
to
being
either
still
a
tasty
occassional
buy
o
this
drinks
more
like
an
ipa
with
darker
malts
instead
of
a
brown
ale
with
a
bit
of
hoppiness
the
aroma
threw
me
for
a
loop
but
once
i
accepted
it
was
the
former
instead
of
the
latter
i
really
grew
to
like
this
one
a
lot
i
have
to
wonder
does
lagunitas
make
anything
that
sucks
dont
answer
that
o
a
nice
mellow
brown
ale
age
seems
to
have
made
this
silky
smooth
goes
down
like
water
very
drinkable
sweet
and
smooth
i
enjoyed
it
a
lot
o
one
of
my
new
favorites
from
lagunitas
a
nice
ruby
body
with
fresh
ingredients
that
do
not
overwhelm
each
other
its
a
definite
must
have
this
is
really
a
wonderful
ale
id
call
it
a
cross
between
hop
stoopid
and
arrogant
bastard
and
everone
knows
how
great
those
two
are
highly
recommended
ointeresting
beer
with
features
of
and
ipa
and
strong
dark
ale
an
aggressive
pour
yields
2
fingers
of
soft

deep
copper
brown

is
mild
caramel

without
much
hop
overtones
lacing
becomes
apparent
even
before
the
first
sip
the
taste
of
the
beer
fills
every
corner
of
the
mouth
in
a
pleasant
mix
of
carbonation
malt
and
hops
no
apparent
bitterness
for
me
and
it
soothes
the
esophagus
on
the
pleasing
journey
to
the
stomach
very
well
balanced
with
no
overpowering
elements
it
can
meld
to
fit
almost
any
occasion
o
its
hard
to
classify
this
beer
lagunitas
calls
it
an
imperial
brown
aleand
ba
calls
it
a
strong
ale
it
tastes
likea
cross
between
a
brown
ale
and
an
ipa
it
is
a
perfect
kick
back
feel
good
beer
definitely
worth
trying
and
always
having
on
hand
in
the
cooler
i
was
pretty
impressed
with
this
one
for
the
price
its
a
quality
beer
its
superbly
balanced
and
very
flavorful
to
me
it
almost
tastes
like
a
robust
ipa
that
the
hops
have
faded
from
overall
overall
this
was
a
good
beer
it
falls
under
the
american
strong
ale
category
but
can
easily
be
categorized
as
a
brown
ale
in
fact
i
can
go
as
far
as
to
call
it
an
imperial
brown
ale
it
has
the
taste
and
feel
of
a
brown
ale
but
with
a
heavier
hop
presence
and
a
higher
alcohol
percentage
i
also
like
the
fact
that
it
left
a
good
aftertaste
wilco
tango
foxtrot
from
the
folks
at

pours
a
murky
copper
with
flashes
of
amber
around
the
edges
an
inch
of
creamy
tan
head
sticks
around
as
well
as
to
the
glass
hoppy
aromas
of
grapefruit
and
pine
are
very
noticeable
and
very
lagunitas
like
muted
caramel
and
toasted
malt
aromas
provide
some
contrast
to
the
hoppiness
the
caramel
malt
sweetness
with
just
a
touch
of
rye
opens
the
palate
up
to
receive
a
wallop
of
citrus
and
piney
hop
that
pulls
through
the
finish
medium
in
both
body
and
carbonation
this
recovery

weighs
in
at

poured
into
a

minimal
carbonationlacing
taste
is
quite
something
woody
bitter
pine
hops
with
hints
of
cinnamon
caramel
and
clove
in
the
finish
stays
complex
and
is
fairly
drinkable
considering
the
abv
body
could
use
some
more
carbonation
not
sure
if
thats
due
to
the
serving
type
worth
seeking
out
ofor
the
style
this
was
a
bit
more
sour
than
the
few
others
ive
tried
it
seemed
like
it
would
be
great
if
you
were
expecting
and
wanted
a
sour
beer
but
this
one
was
okay
probably
would
not
buy
again
overall
a
very
good
and
interesting
brew
its
like
an
imperial
brown
ale
that
is
given
a
big
kick
of
hops
dollar

winner
from

food
pairings

pretty
good
beer
although
it
lacked
a
bit
of
richness
i
like
in
a
strong
ale
highly
recommended
being
a
beer
that
is
hard
to
categorize
overall
this
is
not
what
i
am
used
to
from
lagunitas
where
i
really
enjoy
the
ipas
could
not
drink
this
all
the
time
despite
drinkability
but
good
overall
another
good
strong
beer
from
lagunitas
this
one
is
one
of
the
better
ones
from
me
the
hoppiness
isnt
enough
to
steal
the
show
but
definitely
present
the
creamy
and
sweet
malts
are
spot
in
for
a
big
tasty
beer
o
definitely
one
of
the
better
representations
of
the
style
o
a
great
hopped
up
brown
ale
with
divinely
balanced
flavors
i
love
roasty
bready
malt
with
citrus
hops
this
is
a
beer
that
i
would
regularly
drink
doggone
good
overall
very
nice
and
very
drinkable
i
will
definitely
look
into
getting
more
of
this
one
overall
this
is
better
than
i
expected
lagunitas
has
pleasantly
surprised
me
with
their
pilsner
and
now
with
this
this
is
a
complex
brownstrong
ale
with
a
good
mix
of
malts
hops
and
other
flavors
i
would
recommend
you
try
it
o
drinkability
is
high
on
this
one
a
wellexecuted
strong
ale
for
sure
and
it
doesnt
skimp
on
the
bitterness
i
liked
this
a
lot
id
call
it
a
hoppy
american
brown
ale
before
i
call
it
a
strong
ale
but
i
suppose
thats
inconsequential
here
this
beer
pours
a
nice
clear
lighter
brown
indian
red
maybe
with
a
pillowy
tan
head
with
outstanding
retention
the
nose
is
way
hoppy
for
a
brown
it
crowds
out
any
malt
sweetness
and
plays
off
the
bitter
cocoa
powder
element
perfectly
the
flavor
is
also
quite
hopped
up
and
for
once
in
a
lagunitas
beer
that
same
old
yeast
strain
actually
works
here
at
least
it
doesnt
detract
from
the
feature
elements
i
should
say
its
a
nonissue
which
is
nice
for
a
change
love
the
roasty
malts
with
the
hop
bitter
its
an
underutilized
combination
of
flavors
great
carbonation
and
soft
texture
to
a
bigger
beer
the
finish
is
complex
and
chocolate
forward
but
there
is
also
a
little
residual
sugar
that
challenges
the
hops
this
is
a
great
beer
totally
unique
and
one
i
will
absolutely
be
buying
again
outstanding
stuff
cant
really
add
much
more
to
whats
already
been
said
its
a
delicious
brown
ale
on
steroids
you
get
the
nice
malt
and
brown
sugar
that
you
expect
from
a
brown
with
an
extra
hop
punch
you
also
get
a
hint
of
booziness
and
a
great
full
bodied
mouthfeel
love
this
beer
and
look
forward
to
picking
up
some
more
overall
this
is
a
rather
interesting
brew
with
a
rather
complex
flavor
profile
yet
it
still
maintains
a
great
somewhat
nice
complimentarily
between
the
mix
of
flavors
an
interesting
and
tasty

that
makes
you

this
is
the
most
drinkable

strong

ive
had
so
far
delicious
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
would
definitely
get
it
again

good

flavor
nice
brew
for
a
snowy
day
bitter
up
front
but
then
sweet
to
the
finish
o
a
very
nice
american
strong
brown
ale
o
it
seems
like
the
hops
are
a
bit
too
aggressive
because
they
compete
with
the
malt
bill
in
a
way
that
is
unbalanced
i
know
thats
a
stylistic
choice
for
lagunitas
but
it
seems
to
have
gone
a
bit
too
far
in
this
case
poured
out
of
a
22oz
bottle
wtf
this
is
a
good
beer
but
i
have
liked
all
the
beers
i
have
had
from
laguntias
the
smell
is
very
hoppy
the
taste
is
bitter
with
a
little
citrus
the
finish
is
not
quite
as
bitter
as
the
smell
would
lead
you
to
believe
over
all
this
is
a
pretty
drinkable
full
flavored
beer
o
a
nice
hybrid
beer
with
great
balance
and
decent
complexity
easy
to
drink
for
a
strong
ale
with
a
great
price
point
definitely
worth
picking
up
especially
if
youre
a
fan
of
the
brewery
pours
a
clear
deep
ruby
amber
with
a
creamy
1
off
white
head
just
a
bit
of
lacing
on
the
glass
nose
is
very
hoppy
orange
and
lemon
with
a
bit
of
bready
malt
a
little
tart
smell
with
just
a
slight
suggestion
of
alcohol
taste
follows
the
nose
strong
hop
presence
in
the
nose
with
a
nice
caramelly
malt
backbone
really
great
balance
between
the
hops
and
the
malt
on
this
one
just
enough
carbonation
to
lighten
up
the
beer
and
keep
it
super
refreshing
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
beer
very
refreshing
and
not
heavy
at
all
for
a
beer
that
clocks
in
just
under
8
would
definitely
buy
this
brew
again
and
definitely
wont
split
it
next
time
this
was
a
good
beer
and
a
treat
to
sip
on
while
watching
the
first
few
games
of
the
tourney
and
waiting
for
my
food
to
arrive
another
win
for
lagunitas
o
the
hop
smell
of
this
strong
brown
ale
is
reminiscent
of
an
ipa
the
flavor
profile
is
a
little
muddled
good
but
not
great
overall
i
found
it
rather
underwhelming
considering
the
brewery
it
came
from
i
expected
a
lot
better
i
wont
be
trying
this
again
but
it
wont
stop
me
from
enthusiastically
consuming
any
other
lagunitas
brews
cheers
overall
a
solid
hoppy
brown
i
will
be
revisiting
this
one
again
and
again
o
well
balanced
and
with
a
pleasant
amount
of
complexity
to
the
smell
and
taste
i
like
the
easy
drinking
nature
of
this
beer
and
the
fact
that
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
really
enjoyable

i
shouldnt
be
surprised
that
lagunitas
did
another
great
hoppy
beer
overall
solid
brew
nice
change
of
pace
from
hoppier
brews
lagunitas
knows
whats
up
and
continues
to
impress
o
very
good
beer
this
is
a
fullflavor
beer
that
doesnt
assault
your
tongue
with
hops
if
youre
someone
that
wants
more
flavor
but
doesnt
enjoy
being
mugged
by
hops
this
is
an
excellent
choice
similar
to
lagunitas
censored
beer
only
exaggerated
a
bit
very
good
overall
reminiscent
of
many
of
the
lagunitas
releases
but
less
aggressively
hopped
fairly
mellow
allaround
though
not
for
lack
of
flavor
definitely
opens
up
as
the
beer
warms
a
solid
example
of
what
i
feel
should
be
a
recognized
style
an
imperial
brown
served
on
tap
in
a
16oz
pint
glass
beautiful
translucent
brown
color
topped
with
a
34
head
good
looking
persistent
lacing
aroma
is
crisp
with
spicy
undertones
and
a
alcohol
heat
the
flavor
is
classic
brown
ale
and
also
classic
lagunitas
this
is
a
beer
that
gives
you
exactly
what
you
expect
when
you
order
it
overall
lagunitas
does
it
again
something
off
the
beaten
path
here
but
has
that
feel
of
one
of
their
beers
for
sure
at
3
99
a
bomber
you
cannot
do
much
better
dollar
wise
overy
drinkable
beer
well
blended
flavors
great
taste
not
as
hoppy
as
i
thought
it
would
be
but
nonetheless
great
dark
pour
with
sticky
thick
head
very
deep
red
in
color
like
mahogany
smell
is
odd
in
my
opinion
lots
of
malt
but
too
bready
and
yeasty
slightly
boozey
and
slightly
nutty
flavor
is
mostly
malts
like
a
heavy
duty
brown
ale
to
me
it
also
had
hints
of
soy
and
is
mildly
salty
slightly
sweet
like
brown
sugar
overall
drinkable
but
a
little
odd
for
me
to
want
to
recommend
would
drink
again
nuff
said
overall
a
pretty
nice
strong
ale
but
i
feel
it
could
be
better
a
little
more
roast
to
add
to
the
hops
would
be
wonderful
d
a
decent
brew
just
not
outstanding
would
be
best
enjoyed
with
a
meatbased
meal
o
id
say
this
was
a
good
beer
quite
enjoyable
the
smell
was
heavenly
and
the
taste
was
good
but
didnt
line
up
with
the
pleasant
aroma
ive
not
yet
had
a
bad
lagunitas
beer
o
this
is
a
pretty
good
strong
ale
but
is
lacking
in
places
its
tasty
easy
to
drink
and
hides
the
alcohol
well
im
glad
i
tried
it
lagunitas
wilco
tango
foxtrot
45
o
this
reminds
of
brown
sugga
not
as
sugary
and
delicious
of
it
bit
maybe
the
base
of
the
actual
ale
this
is
delicious
as
it
is
and
a
fine
example
of
american
strong
ale
i
know
nothing
of
this
brewery
but
im
liking
them
beer
by
beer
overall
this
is
not
a
beer
for
the
masses
it
is
very
malty
and
very
hoppy
which
is
not
a
combination
you
find
to
often
you
have
to
be
looking
for
a
beer
like
this
to
enjoy
it
but
i
did
final
of
the
beer
trip
bombers
poured
from
the
bomber
into
a
pint
glass
nice
fluffy
head
a
deep
amber
color
aroma
is
hoppy
with
a
bit
of
carmel
bit
sweet
in
flavor
with
a
nice
crisp
finish
and
some
roasted
flavors
pleasantly
surprised
with
this
beer
cant
wait
to
try
other
beers
from
lagunitas
o
i
dumped
half
the
bomber
just
not
good
at
all
o
a
wonderful
strong
ale
lots
of
flavor
love
the
big
smooth
malt
character
and
zesty
earthy
hops
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
from
lagunitas
i
wasnt
quite
sure
what
to
make
of
it
after
the
first
few
sips
but
it
certainly
grew
on
me
overall
a
satisfying
and
tasty
brew
if
you
think
youd
like
a
brown
or
red
aleipa
crossover
youll
probably
like
this
beer
o
absolutely
enjoyable
best
enjoyed
with
a
heavy
meal
and
as
a
first
beverage
unless
you
are
looking
for
an
end
of
the
night
knock
out
this
will
work
for
that
as
well
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
from
lagunitas
i
wasnt
quite
sure
what
to
make
of
it
after
the
first
few
sips
but
it
certainly
grew
on
me
i
enjoyed
this
slighly
more
than
the
undercover
shutdown
as
that
was
a
bit
too
bitter
and
biting
because
of
the
higher
abv
od
a
good
beer
worthy
of
the
try
nothing
too
exceptional
about
it
just
well
done
i
would
have
liked
to
have
tried
this
a
little
younger
to
see
where
these
hops
flavors
were
at
first
bottle
poured
a
dark
amber
color
ale
with
a
large
offwhite
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
lacing
aroma
of
pine
and
citrus
hops
notes
with
huge
caramel
malt
notes
taste
is
also
a
mix
between
some
huge
malt
caramel
notes
with
balanced
sweetness
which
is
mix
with
some
citrus
and
resin
hops
body
is
quite
full
with
good
carbonation
this
brewery
keeps
putting
out
great
beers
i
wish
i
would
have
more
access
to
them
this
one
strikes
me
as
a
strong
brown
ale
and
apparently
thats
what
it
is
now
that
ive
read
it
here
with
some
thick
malt
tones
with
some
spicy
hop
going
on
as
well
its
an
interesting
ale
not
sure
it
really
flows
as
an
imperial
brown
ale
lots
of
pine
and
citrus
fruit
in
the
nose
taste
is
sweet
and
malty
before
being
overthrown
by
hops
light
fruit
and
light
hops
interesting
flavor
progression
intense
hop
aroma
and

and

flavors
up

with
a
very
malty
backbone
there
is
a
mild
amount
of

on

with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp

overall
and
it
does
it
well
the
hops
are
strong
but
the
malt
is
wholly
lacking
either
im
going
to
pick
up
a
couple
of
bottles
to
age
to
see
how
they
compare

medium

fairly
powerful
carbonation

effect
o
an
enjoyable
brew
loved
the
use
of
lots
of
hops
with
this
brown
ale
overall
a
solid
brew
that
begs
for
more
hops
to
put
it
over
the
edge
o
not
sure
how
i
would
classify
this
i
know
lagunitas
offers
an
imperial
red
ale
but
this
seems
similar
to
me
big
hops
a
touch
of
sweet
malt
and
a
nice
balanced
finish
o
overall
this
beer
drinking
experience
has
been
a
success
i
enjoy
the
beer
and
it
didnt
cost
a
lot
this
is
a
rather
strange
brew
its
supposedly
an
imperial
brown
ale
but
it
reminds
me
more
of
a
german
doppelbock
or
something
i
donno
but
i
recommend
trying
this
one
out
othis
is
a
pretty
good
beer
much
hoppier
than
expected
but
cant
complain
about
that
nice
malty
flavor
mixes
well
i
think
this
was
a
nice
surprise
and
wouldnt
mind
having
this
again
overall
if
you
like
your
brews
strong
lagunitas
is
on
to
something
here
strong
yet
refined
in
taste
a
creamy
texture
combined
makes
for
an
ale
you
wont
forget
even
if
its
a
little
disjointed
in
what
it
wants
to
be
i
actually
kind
of
think
its
akin
to
a
red
ale
more
than
brown
anyway
o
this
is
another
very
drinkable
beer
from
lagunitas
i
enjoy
all
their
sessional
beers
i
also
the
like
the
political
nature
of
this
beer
because
its
a
wtf
to
obama
and
all
the
promises
he
didnt
keep
poured
a
dark
opaque
copper
that
appeared
to
be
totally
filtered
produced
a
very
small
tighly
laced
bone
white
head
that
was
reduced
to
a
mere
inconsistent
ring
around
the
glass
there
is
a
slight
hoppiness
smell
with
little
else
the
tastes
are
very
blan
with
a
slight
bitter
hop
forward
taste
an
even
slighter
malt
finish
the
buds
are
left
tasteless
not
really
sure
whats
going
on
with
this
im
as
confused
as
the
bottle
for
the
label
reads
were
not
quite
in
the
red
or
in
the
black
does
that
mean
were
in
the
brown
this
beer
left
a
lot
to
be
desired
regardless
of
what
style
it
was
aiming
for
the
price
was
cheap
and
this
is
definitely
a
case
of
getting
what
you
paid
for
overall
its
solid
but
slighty
off
in
balance
kind
of
feel
like
its
two
different
styles
trying
fighting
with
eachother
trying
to
be
the
featured
beer
decent
great
price
but
forgetable
with
all
the
other
great
beers
out
there
worth
a
drink
one
time
or
so
c
overall
wtf
is
very
good
beer
wtf
is
just
a
really
good
stronger
deep
flavored
ale
that
is
damn
cheap
4

a
bomber
more
hops
than
i
expected
i
never
argue
with
that
but
still
very
well
balanced
in
all
areas
i
wonder
what
a
year
or
even
two
would
do
to
this
one
cheers
didnt
really
have
any
expectations
coming
into
this
but
it
tastes
like
a
strong
esb
using
cascade
hops
some
chocolate
or
crystal
malt
sweetness
would
really
help
this
one
be
more
balanced
i
did
like
the
hop
flavors
but
this
missed
the
mark
o
this
is
a
very
good
quality
beer
this
beer
is
perfect
on
the
wallet
which
is
also
a
plus
too
o
definitely
worth
a
try
notes
wtf
is
a
complex
brew
with
impeccable
flavor
and
medium
body
alcohol
is
hard
to
detect
even
though
its
there
amazingly
drinkable
and
for
that
it
could
be
dangerous
i
love
this
beer
as
it
is
great
by
itself
and
would
pair
with
just
about
any
hearty
meal
venison
roast
anyone
overall
what
an
interesting
mix
of
flavors
the
balance
and
complexity
here
are
really
nice
has
flavors
from
multiple
styles
here
and
it
works
so
well
unique
and
very
tasty
go
out
of
your
way
to
give
this
one
a
try
it
says
59
ibus
but
it
truly
tastes
like
more
good
beer
would
buy
this
again
i
really
enjoyed
the
depth
of
flavor
and
aroma
i
wasnt
expecting
such
intense
dark
fruit
flavor
from
this
brown
beer
the
body
finished
a
little
bit
thin
and
dry
however
i
think
a
richer
mouthfeel
and
more
significant
body
would
really
compliment
this
extremely
tasty
brew
o
overall
a
really
fantastic
release
from
lagunitas
once
again
o
a
very
drinkable
and
flavorful
fruity
strong
ale
great
for
when
your
sitting
around
having
a
lazy
day
or
out
enjoying
a
night
on
the
town
i
could
see
this
going
great
with
a
cigar
sitting
out
on
your
back
porch
looking
out
into
the
horizon
a
very
delicious
strong
sophisticated
beer
o
nice
balance
bear
i
would
drink
this
again
o
enjoyable
beer
o
another
delightful
beer
from
lagunitas
these
folks
never
seem
to
disappoint
overall
a
nice
beer
to
sip
on
a
chilly
january
night
when
the
predictions
for
a
massive
snowstorm
have
been
greatly
exaggerated
wtf
all
in
all
a
good
beer
lagunitas
certainly
is
a
fan
of
the
strong
ales
and
its
clear
to
me
that
they
do
them
well
as
a
side
note
body
is
lighter
too
hasnt
thickened
up
yet
making
me
wonder
why
this
isnt
in
as
an
american
brown
and
how
can
you
not
enjoy
the
name
wtf
o
solid
beer
from
a
solid
brewery
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
i
wish
was
available
everywhere
in
6packs
lightly
carbonated
and
bordering
on
a
fullbodied
beer
wilco
tango
foxtrot
goes
down
quite
easily
in
spite
of
its
relative
strength
it
is
juicy
soft
on
the
palate
and
slightly
warming
with
a
pleasant
maltiness
that
serves
as
a
counterbalance
to
the
hoppy
character
that
lingers
on
the
tongue
a
bitter
long
finishing
drink
that
pairs
well
with
food
this
is
an
ale
to
be
savored
only
to
be
brought
out
when
the
need
for
a
little
good
cheer
is
pressing
overall
not
my
favorite
from
lagunitas
even
though
this
is
a
solid
brew
i
will
buy
it
again
next
year
just
not
my
favorite
american
strong
ale
especially
9
99
for
a
22oz
bottle
53
o
nicely
balanced
and
enjoyable
beer
pairs
well
with
cheese
i
love
this
brewery
but
honestly
this
is
one
particular
flavour
of
theirs
i
wouldnt
go
searching
for
any
time
soon
poured
a
1
12
offwhite
head
which
lasted
pretty
long
clear
burnt
umber
brown
body
with
a
touch
of
red
when
backlit
smells
nice
but
its
mainly
malt
and
a
little
hint
of
hops
taste
mirrors
the
smell
with
sweet
malt
and
medium
hops
in
the
finish
enjoyable
but
not
a
big
standout
other
than
the
fine
economic
wellwishes
on
the
labelling
o
i
like
this
overall
it
reminds
me
of
a
supermellow
bigfoot
not
available
locally
but
if
its
still
in
stock
the
next
time
im
in
illinois
i
would
probably
buy
another
o
an
interesting
brew
and
highly
enjoyable
i
guess
this
is
their
take
on
a
black
ipa
whatever
style
it
is
its
worth
seeking
out
especially
at
5
50
a
bottle
interesting
and
perfectly
drinkable
but
doesnt
particularly
grab
me
flirts
with
a
few
different
styles
without
landing
anywhere
definitive
powerful
smell
starts
off
from
the
pour
rye
bread
raisin
caramel
all
malt
like
a
good
brown
poured
with
little
lace
and
small
head
that
went
away
and
is
brown
like
a
cola
mouth
is
full
with
mostly
the
raisinprune
aftertaste
just
a
touch
of
bite
at
the
end
and
in
a
bit
of
foaming
taste
is
all
of
the
above
mostly
fruity
on
top
of
huge
malt
with
a
caramel
sweetness
at
the
bottom
strong
ale
indeed
this
one
hits
everything
very
complex
and
tasty
id
get
this
again
pretty
good
well
balanced
brown
ale
it
took
some
skill
and
finesse
to
get
these
flavors
to
meld
so
well
overall
a
good
beer
i
find
lagunitas
regular
offerings
to
be
a
little
tame
and
stale
but
their
limited
releases
are
something
to
be
sought
after
all
around
this
is
a
really
solid
brew
was
expecting
more
of
a
barley
wine
style
beer
but
this
is
not
quite
as
extreme
as
that
in
its
favor
really
good
beer
i
will
be
buying
again
a
brown
and
ruby
red
blend
with
an
inch
of
foamy
off
white
head
it
leaves
a
thick
ring
around
the
edges
malty
sweet
aroma
brown
sugar
and
caramel
some
cherry
and
faint
amount
of
raisin
fruity
malt
flavor
upfront
bready
caramel
backbone
with
cherries
and
raisins
the
middle
is
slightly
sweet
with
more
of
a
grape
twist
than
raisin
finishes
dry
i
was
expecting
a
tangy
sweet
end
but
this
dryness
was
surprising
in
a
good
way
as
the
beer
warms
the
8
shines
through
the
cherry
flavor
turns
medicinal
i
am
a
fan
of
the
flavor
combinations
just
not
when
it
warms
up
a
bit
overall
an
excellent
brew
one
of
the
best
strong
ales
ive
had
in
quite
a
while
definitely
expected
more
bitterness
especially
after
running
it
under
my
nose
one
of
the
best
balanced
beers
ive
ever
had
excellent
work
by
lagunitas
a
malty
robust
jobless
recovery
ale
if
this
is
supposed
to
be
the
antidote
to
those
whom
are
suffering
in
this
current
climate
then
theyre
going
to
be
in
recovery
mode
for
a
long
time
im
in
a
rush
so
i
didnt
put
much
thought
into
this
but
its
really
good
very
good
beer
we
can
debate
elsewhere
to
what
degree
a
jobless
recovery
to
which
this
beer
is
dedicated
on
the
label
but
brews
like
wtf
and
arrogant
bastard
are
so
good
i
feel
that
more
should
be
made

the

just

taste
of

is

leaves
you
with

i
found
it

to
drink
lagunitas
always
puts
out
good
value
beers
not
anything
mind
blowing
but
for
the
money
its
hard
to
beat
this
is
no
exception
its
a
midgravity

brown
ale
that
shows
no
hotness
with
a
molasses
sweet
malt
backbone
with
a
hint
of
brown
sugar
and
bit
of
roast
and
just
a
bit
of
hops
to
keep
it
from
going
over
board
its
a
simple
plan
for
a
simple
beer
that
hits
the
mark
for
an
easy
drinking
good
tasting
brown
ale
pours
a
translucent
brown
with
very
creamy
head
that
retains
well
laces
nicely
and
is
by
far
the
best
feature
of
this
ale
nose
is
rather
weak
some
light
citrus
on
the
palate
the
citrusy
hops
come
right
out
and
remind
me
of
all
the
black
ipa
rage
lately
as
the
color
in
this
beer
does
not
deliver
the
expected
roasty
malty
whollop
that
the
color
would
suggest
a
bit
leafy
on
the
finish
d
a
fantastic
brew
from
lagunitas
they
know
how
to
take
a
brew
and
validate
a
flavor
profile
and
that
keeps
me
coming
back
for
more
there
is
a
strong
amount
of
alcohol
in
his
brew
however
i
think
a
bomber
or
two
of
these
is
not
only
feasible
but
a
great
time
as
well
a
good
west
coast
strong
american
ale
i
bought
this
as
a
suggestion
from
a
friend
and
i
am
not
disappointed
since
this
is
apparently
a
limited
release
im
thinking
of
grabbing
a
case
to
hold
me
through

this

well
i
like
it
well
enough
but
i
think
ill
have
to
peg
the
drinkability
to
the
flavor
as
the
hop
flavor
accumulates
on
my
palate
it
becomes
rather
spent
and
vegetabley
not
a
great
complement
to
some
of
this
beers
better
aspects
overall
another
really
impressive
beer
lagunitas
deserves
all
of
the
credit
it
gets
and
then
some
they

sell

lacing
all
the
way
down
the
glass
once
again
lagunitas
has
made
a
really
pretty
beer
the
aroma
is
odd
big
piney
resiny
hops
mixed
with
brown
sugar
and
chocolate
bit
of
raisin
the
flavor
is
much
the
same
up
front
once
again
you
get
this
big
piney
hops
semi
brutalizing
the
palate
not
what
i
expected
then
it
completely
switches
gears
and
hits
you
with
brown
sugar
a
little
bit
of
sweet
chocolate
prunes
and
raisins
then
bam
its
back
to
the
hops
for
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
perfectly
carbonated
for
me
this
is
a
marriage
that
ends
in
divorce
the
flavors
just
dont
work
together
and
instead
butt
heads
d
this
is
a
beer
that
is
very
typical
of
what
i
have
come
to
expect
of
lagunitas
the
combination
of
rich
caramel
and
toffee
malt
with
aggressive
hoppiness
reminds
me
of
several
of
their
beers
that
i
have
had
in
the
past
this
is
even
more
unusual
than
the
rest
of
their
catalogue
with
the
dark
malt
having
an
intense
bready
caramel
and
molasses
character
complimented
by
odd
notes
of
smoke
worth
trying
though
i
dont
know
that
i
will
have
another
one
dthis
one
is
delicious
and
drinkable
for
just
shy
of
8
it
has
no
trace
of
the
abv
in
the
taste
or
mouthfeel
pretty
drinkable
def
a
wtf
of
a
beer
very
interesting
unconventional
and
tasty
poured
from
a
22oz
bottle
into
a
spaten
mug
i
had
tried
this
offering
at
a
local
beer
festival
on
tap
and
was
quite
impressed
out
of
the
bottle
didnt
disappoint
either
poured
a
light
brown
with
a
one
finger
offwhite
head
lacing
was
slight
throughout
the
aroma
had
hints
of
nuts
upon
first
inspection
this
brew
has
a
medium
body
on
the
palate
with
average
carbonation
overall
this
is
an
excellent
brew
from
lagunitas
i
just
hope
that
they
come
up
with
more
offerings
like
this
one
d
very
drinkable
good
mix
of
flavors
and
feel
for
a
really
interesting
beer
d
well
i
missed
out
in
getting
another
bottle
of
the
cappuccino
stout
before
it
so
wtf
i
better
get
me
another
one
before
its
gone
since
i
never
heard
of
an
imperial
brown
this
would
have
to
be
a
good
rep
of
one
d
great
beer
pretty
impressive
and
much
better
than
i
had
expected
pours
a
clear
dark
brownred
color
with
a
good
offwhite
head
which
soon
turns
to
a
film
mild
aroma
of
malts
and
hop
spicyness
taste
of
toasted
malts
hops
spices
and
brown
sugar
mediumbodied
with
a
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
an
enjoyable
beer
strong
for
a
brown
ale
but
drinks
nice
id
certainly
get
this
again
beautiful
deep
reddish
brown
short
creamy
beige
head
that
lingered
and
laced
nicely
nicely
balanced
aroma
complex
bouquet
of
hops
and
sweet
malt
could
definitely
pick
this
out
of
a
lineup
as
a
lagunitas
beer
its
by
no
means
light
but
it
is
lighter
than
i
expected
given
the
color
and
abv
wtf
a
limited
release
and
i
plan
do
my
part
in
consuming
this
batchs
inventory
d
overall
a
fairly
light
easy
drinking
flavorful
beer
too
bad
its
a
limited
release
lagunitas
is
trying
to
break
our
hearts
i
could
and
will
drink
several
of
these
in
a
setting
very
good
beer
by
lagunitas
especially
for
the
value
d
this
has
some
nice
maltiness
but
sort
of
a
halfhearted
overall
flavor
i
keep
waiting
for
it
to
open
up
and
start
to
wow
me
a
little
but
it
isnt
really
happening
not
bad
but
not
really
recommended
this
finally
showed
up
in
colorado
and
for
my
money
i
really
feel
like
i
get
a
good
value
out
of
lagunitas
beers
this
was
brown
but
almost
chestnut
light
brown
it
smelled
like
a
brown
ale
and
nothing
special
at
that
but
the
taste
was
a
real
departure
the
flavor
was
super
hoppy
to
me
almost
like
an
ipa
or
something
very
cool
unimpressed
come
on
lagunitas
i
expect
more
drinkability
was
pretty
good
no
real
alcohol
flavor
to
it
so
it
would
be
easy
to
drink
quite
a
few
glasses
the
body
was
good
even
clean
and
balanced
drinkability
was
good
id
have
a
couple
in
a
row
but
maybe
not
more
than
that
overall
a
solidly
decent
beer
that
has
taken
a
step
in
restoring
my
opinion
of
this
brewery
overall
this
brew
is
one
for
an
all
around
picky
person
its
got
such
a
light
hop
scent
mixed
with
light
malt
presence
i
was
expecting
alil
more
of
a
showcase
of
malt
but
still
highly
drinkable
this
would
be
a
good
one
to
have
on
a
hot
summer
day
drinkability
lagunitas
has
hit
it
out
of
the
ballpark
with
this
one
tremendously
complex
malt
profile
matches
up
with
the
hoppiness
you
expect
from
this
brewery
one
of
the
better
beers
from
lagunitas
and
as
usual
its
well
priced
pours
walnut
brown
with
a
garnet
tinge
decent
head
to
start
but
it
fades
a
little
too
quickly
smells
malty
and
a
bit
sweet
but
there
are
some
earthy
hops
and
a
vinous
note
that
helps
it
from
being
cloying
very
nice
flavors
this
is
a
bold
beer
but
surprisingly
malty
for
lagunitas
nice
breadiness
with
a
touch
of
citrus
and
molasses
as
well
as
some
spicy
earthy
hops
nice
body
without
being
overwhelming
or
too
sweet
creamy
but
firm
the
alcohol
is
noticeable
but
reasonably
well
hidden
as
well
overall
a
very
balanced
delicious
beer
unleashing
this
translucent
deep
mahogany
liquid
from
bottle
unto
glass
imbibers
will
be
presented
with
an
ample
eruption
of
lightly
tan
head
subsiding
with
some
hustle
yet
retaining
a
nice
cap
for
mild
lacing
strong
aroma
full
of
citrus
foretells
the
hoppy
flavor
of
this
brew
with
malt
flavors
present
though
taking
a
backseat
alcohol
apparent
somewhat
sweet
and
sticky
with
a
tart
finish
and
lingering
bitterness
astringent
very
drinkable
beer
and
nice
mouthfeel
another
very
good
beer
from
lagunitas
under
a
finger
of
head
dissipates
quickly
over
a
beautiful
copper
and
red
nice
cap
of
retention
and
some
lacing
aromas
are
toasted
biscuit
and
dark
fruits
with
fig
and
prune
the
initial
taste
reveals
toasted
biscuit
malts
which
are
pretty
huge
is
that
the
robust
the
label
promises
theres
a
bit
of
bitter
bite
and
some
significant
notes
of
alcohol
mouthfeel
is
light
with
medium
carbonation
all
in
all
nice
and
warming
very
drinkable
and
well
crafted
hops
flavor
surprisingly
has
a
larger
role
than
expected
and
helps
to
amplify
the
taste
by
keeping
the
malt
from
becoming
cloyingly
sweet
barely
any
alcohol
heat
on
the
swallow
another
nice
offering
a
wonderfully
crafted
beer
id
definitely
recommend
this
would
easily
become
a
goto
beer
for
me
if
it
was
available
as
such
this
is
one
of
the
better
drinking
beers
i
have
had
in
a
while
the
generous
character
leaves
you
craving
more
yet
nothing
punishing
to
the
palate
and
easy
to
consume
a
deep
copper
colored
brew
with
a
thick
light
oatmeal
colored
head
and
stifling
amounts
of
lacing
the
aroma
offers
sweet
malt
vinegar
and
some
cat
piss
hops
with
earthy
malt
pretty
intense
with
a
slight
bubblegum
overtone
nice
the
flavor
comes
on
with
a
malty
blend
of
grapefruit
hop
and
fruit
nougat
its
a
mediumplus
bodied
brew
with
fairly
low
carbonation
and
a
silky
feel
quite
drinkable
for
the
style
but
you
can
sense
some
alcohol
this
comes
close
to
some
outstanding
dipas
its
very
good
just
a
hair
off
the
best
i
think
theres
some
nutty
champagne
qualities
a
very
nice
beer
cheers
i
think
this
is
my
favorite
american
strong
since
stone
arrogant
bastard
the
color
is
a
dark
brown
with
a
good
head
but
not
too
big
foam
color
is
much
lighter
than
the
beer
flavor
is
mellower
than
the
arrogant
bastard
but
very
good
and
a
great
balance
of
malt
hops
and
alcohol
would
recommend
another
good
offering
from
lagunitas
im
sitting
up
listening
to
wilco
while
drinking
lagunitas
wilco
tango
foxtrot
a
nice
hybrid
hoppy
brown
ale
after
putting
the
babies
down
for
slumber
pours
a
deep
mahogany
brown
hue
with
a
nice
fulfilling
two
finger
gap
of
light
khaki
head
floating
above
the
body
of
this
brew
minimal
amounts
of
speckled
lacing
cling
to
my
imperial
pint
glass
im
imbibing
from
aromatics
bring
out
some
nice
hops
with
herbal
tea
leaf
and
citric
qualities
going
down
a
spearmint
herbal
tone
really
interweaves
with
the
dark
roasted
malty
layers
as
well
brings
out
some
cookie
dough
and
creamy
malt
notes
as
well
flavors
include
a
nice
biscuit
dark
roasty
brown
malt
backbone
kicking
up
the
dust
with
a
few
scraps
of
herbalcitricand
minty
hop
bursts
flying
across
the
palate
quite
the
excellent
experience
as
it
warms
the
hops
brighten
in
the
best
possible
way
i
will
call
this
an
iba
quite
possibly
the
best
example
i
have
had
of
the
india
brown
ale
thus
far
competing
closely
between
dfh
and
terrapin
versions
that
ive
enjoyed
like
a
nice
hop
tea
joined
with
some
italian
biscotti
those
brown
malts
make
this
a
warm
and
inviting
experience
mouthfeel
is
soft
carbonation
is
sturdy
yet
restrained
enough
to
let
the
beer
do
the
talking
excellent
finish
on
the
palate
with
occasional
citric
hop
burps
arising
in
the
back
of
the
throat
this
is
one
kick
ass
drinking
beer
no
worries
find
this
one
and
give
it
a
shot
what
does
the
title
refer
to
or
mean
i
have
no
clue
but
i
know
good
beer
when
i
see
it
im
glad
it
made
me
tune
into
wilcos
yanke
hotel
foxtrot
fuckin
classic
listening
jewel
to
go
along
with
this
great
drinking
iba
getting
something
thats
essentially
called
wtf
on
the
shelf
is
a
testament
to
some
clever
marketing
by
the
folks
at
lagunitas
i
wasnt
quite
sure
what
to
expect
from
past
experiences
with
this
company
but
i
was
pleased
with
this
beer
though
not
quite
in
the
realm
of
arrogant
bastard
with
respect
to
american
strong
ales
wtf
has
a
unique
complexity
of
its
own
that
is
very
enjoyable
this
brew
is
a
limited
release
so
i
recommend
trying
it
on
account
of
its
balance
flavor
and
price
3
50
for
a
22
oz
bomber
this
one
drinks
relativly
easy
nothing
to
strong
in
here
to
slow
you
down
no
alcohol
really
detectable
one
is
enough
in
my
opinion
however
i
prolly
wont
seek
this
out
again
i
wouldnt
really
recommend
it
either
unless
you
got
a
thing
for
lagunitas
but
theyve
never
really
wowed
me
with
a
beer
yet
i
dont
think
ive
had
this
in
the
intervening
three
years
still
looks
the
same
as
i
described
smell
could
be
about
the
same
i
get
more
dark
fruity
flavor
now
and
no
soap
mouthfeel
is
still
soft
but
id
go
with
plush
instead
of
gritty
now
d
i
enjoy
it
but
i
dont
know
that
i
could
drink
two
of
them
back
to
back
good
this
the
bottle
is
about
1
5
then
a
very
tasty
and
drinkable
brew
with
some
of
lagunitas
trademark
whimsical
branding
d
this
beer
has
some
nice
malts
of
a
red
ale
and
some
darker
roasted
malts
that
support
them
the
good
balance
between
full
hop
flavor
and
rich
malty
flavor
the
hops
are
mostly
flavor
without
bitterness
it
was
refreshing
to
have
a
good
quality
beer
over
7
abv
that
is
under
five
dollars
d
dangerous
dk
this
beer
is
flavorful
and
downable
especially
for
a
strong
ale
this
is
good
stuff
alcohol
flavor
is
neglible
odd
taste
combos
abound
hard
to
place
and
hard
to
take
dont
smear
the
brand
though
they
have
lots
of
good
beers
just
not
this
one
very
interesting
and
well
done
by
a
brewer
that
i
consider
significantly
one
sided
in
their
brewsmostly
unbalanced
hop
bombs
or
derivatives
of
a
good
price
as
always
as
well
strong
flavor
big
malts
but
still
crisp
very
enjoyable
overall
it
was
better
then
i
expected
nice
and
rich
and
very
drinkable
i
would
have
no
trouble
enjoying
this
one
again
any
day
a
new
seasonal
wtf
pours
a
rather
clear
tea
color
with
a
very
little
head
and
many
bubbles
smells
of
big
citrus
and
piney
hoppiness
with
a
little
wheat
bread
with
each
sip
it
clings
to
the
side
of
the
glass
leaving
a
white
curtain
tastes
mingle
on
my
tongue
the
hops
are
there
with
some
spicyness
then
the
malt
perks
up
but
gets
slammed
down
again
in
the
finish
cofffe
comes
into
play
then
quickly
vanishes
as
well
not
much
of
a
strong
ale
but
more
of
a
young
barley
wineipa
combo
poured
in
to
a
pint
glass
and
manifests
a
translucent
brown
ale
minimal
off
white
head
some
pine
grapefruit
and
medium
roasted
malts
brown
pale
ale
seems
to
be
an
appropriate
descriptor
the
malt
character
is
pretty
robust
but
there
is
a
bizarre
clash
between
the
grapefruit
and
the
malt
that
creates
an
off
aroma
and
taste
this
brew
cannot
really
seem
to
reconcile
the
malt
and
hop
element
thought
both
would
be
superb
on
their
own
the
carbonation
is
medium
and
feels
appropriate
for
this
hybrid
and
there
is
a
real
sweet
aftertaste
that
masks
the
7
8
overall
a
very
interesting
beverage
but
i
dont
really
think
the
citrus
hops
belong
here
taste
starts
off
with
some
nutty
toasted
malts
woody
herbal
hop
bitterness
comes
on
quick
caramelsweet
malt
base
provides
some
balance
bitter
dark
chocolate
and
cityroast
kenyan
coffee
takes
over
a
little
fruitiness
peeks
in
but
gets
scared
off
by
the
bitterness
finish
is
hoppy
and
dry
with
lingering
notes
of
weed
hoppier
than
it
smells
with
a
medium
body
and
a
creamy
feel
good
use
a
little
more
balance
and
a
little
less
astringency
still
not
bad
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
with
the
taste
it
definitely
had
a
very
lagunitas
character
to
it
while
still
being
a
very
different
beer
than
others
that
i
have
had
by
this
brewer
i
would
definitely
recommend
it
to
those
who
are
not
really
into
beer
but
like
to
try
new
things
that
they
will
like
backbone
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
this
is
the
first
time
weve
ranked
any
beer
this
high
it
pours
a
dark
ruby
clear
color
into
the
glasswell
carbonated
unexpected
beautifully
floral
hops
in
the
nose
for
what
appears
to
be
a
brown
ale
on
the
palatebrown
sugar
maple
syrup
a
bit
of
smoke
and
raisins
dark
fruit
dates
fig
taste
adds
just
a
splash
of
caramel
malt
and
chocolatemolasses
to
a
resiny
sugary
backbone
thats
offset
by
a
surprising
amount
of
fresh
hops
what
what
the
hell
type
of
beer
is
this
oddly
enough
i
think
it
reminded
me
more
of
arrogant
bastard
than
anything
else
d
good
reminds
me
of
stones
arrogant
bastard
at
times
which
i
like
a
lot
so
thats
a
compliment
very
nice
beer
not
sure
ill
ever
drink
this
in
place
of
hop
stoopid
but
it
aint
bad
note
this
has
characteristics
like
an
ipa
than
anything
else
pours
a
very
nice
syrup
brown
color
with
some
dense
eggshell
head
that
laces
nicely
and
sticks
around
for
a
while
smell
is
good
though
not
what
i
was
expecting
big
citrusy
and
piney
hops
dominate
little
or
no
maltiness
there
at
least
to
me
i
thought
this
was
supposed
to
be
robust
and
malty
hmm
taste
isnt
bad
but
its
pretty
much
just
hopscitrus
and
pine
for
some
reason
the
malt
isnt
shining
through
this
at
all
just
a
slightly
darker
ipa
imperial
brown
ale
seems
to
be
more
like
a
brown
ipa
but
another
nice
offering
from
lagunitas
out

overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
brew
then
again
i
have
been
a
fan
of
all
of
lagunitas
seasonal
releases
drinkability
nice
beer
alot
of
their
beers
are
starting
to
tase
similar
to
me
but
hey
i
like
them
not
a
favorrite
style
but
never
the
less
a
good
effort
md
medium
bodied
but
slick
prickly
carbonation
despite
some
apparent
sweetness
drinkability
is
great
drank
a
22oz
myself
before
i
knew
it
theres
really
no
alcohol
heat
especially
for
an
8
beer
its
also
worth
mentioning
that
i
picked
this
up
for
like
4
bucks
or
something
nice
thanks
lagunitas
d
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
no
trace
of
the
alcohol
at
all
i
am
quickly
becoming
a
huge
fan
of
lagunitas
brewing
as
i
said
i
liked
the
smooth
creaminess
of
this
beer
as
well
as
the
sweet
then
hop
flavor
nice
on
a
cooler
day
pours
out
a
reddish
brown
with
about
a
inch
head
on
it
that
doesnt
seem
to
want
to
go
away
the
smell
reminds
me
of
what
a
forrest
would
smell
like
after
heavy
rain
think
pine
and
wet
bark
the
flavor
has
plenty
of
sweet
caramel
and
maltiness
to
balance
out
the
hops
the
pine
smell
comes
though
on
the
flavor
as
well
with
a
little
grapefruit
thrown
in
mouthfeel
is
nearly
perfect
with
the
alcohol
very
well
balanced
mouthfeel
is
mediumfull
with
a
smooth
amount
of
carbonation
pours
a
nice
deep
ruby
redbrown
color
in
the
glass
with
some
nice
ecru
colored
head
aromas
of
nuts
brown
sugar
and
earthy
hops
on
the
palate
i
get
more
nuttiness
braced
with
oranges
and
a
bit
of
chocolate
another
great
effort
from
lagunitasalcohol
is
well
hidden
leaving
a
nice
sneakily
drinkable
beer
behind
d
definitely
got
this
as
a
total
surprise
from
a
friend
during
the
final
four
i
was
previously
drinking
a
glass
of
coke
zero
when
this
was
served
to
me
in
a
clean
pint
glass
the
only
way
i
can
tell
the
difference
between
it
and
the
coke
zero
is
the
coke
has
ice
in
it
the
smell
is
nondescript
slightly
malty
not
much
hop
aroma
at
all
the
taste
is
much
hoppier
than
i
expected
earthy
flavored
hops
and
a
malty
taste
give
the
beer
a
full
almost
biscuity
taste
that
reminds
me
of
a
super
strength
irish
red
a
moderately
easy
drinker
i
feel
that
it
doesnt
really
do
any
one
thing
particularly
well
a
solid
beer
but
not
really
worth
seeking
out
in
my
opinion
nearly
an
arrogant
bastard
clone
another
tasty
offering
from
lah
goo
knee
tuss
though
hardly
the
caliber
of
some
of
their
others
wont
get
again
pours
a
solid
brown
color
hazy
wtih
a
wispy
tan
colored
head
that
settled
into
a
sparse
cap
the
aroma
is
of
citrus
hops
light
honey
and
lemon
not
very
strong
in
aroma
and
what
is
there
is
pretty
much
all
hops
the
taste
is
of
muted
caramel
malt
dried
citrus
hops
light
pine
and
some
tea
like
bitterness
tastes
like
a
dull
hoppy
amber
ale
i
guess
i
was
figuring
there
might
be
more
of
a
toasty
brown
ale
malt
presence
to
this
thing
moderate
to
fully
bodied
with
active
carbonation
finishes
with
a
tropical
fruit
hoppy
bitterness
an
average
hoppy
amber
ale
with
a
higher
abv
was
hoping
for
more
of
a
malty
presence
with
this
one
no
off
flavors
but
nothing
spectacular
update
bumped
up
the
flavor
score
and
mouthfeel
after
giving
this
another
try
more
of
the
malt
complexity
was
apparent
and
the
am
strong
ale
hoppiness
busted
through
more
abundantly
this
time
i
like
others
in
their
lineup
but
this
is
solid
stuff
this
is
a
very
drinkable
strong
ale
while
it
isnt
overly
complex
it
is
an
easy
drinker
for
nearly
8
the
taste
is
more
bitter
than
i
would
have
imagined
more
grapefruit
and
dulled
citrus
flavors
wow
that
last
sip
tasted
so
much
like
pineapple
that
i
though
i
was
drinking
pineapple
juice
seriously
i
will
go
buy
another
one
of
these
i
really
liked
it
d
didnt
think
this
one
was
as
high
abv
as
its
was
very
well
hidden
to
say
the
least
not
to
big
not
to
bold
maybe
a
bit
different
then
other
strong
ale
ive
had
but
it
was
real
nice
will
have
to
look
for
this
on
draft
while
the
bottle
was
interesting
this
just
felt
like
another
lagunitas
seasonal
i
love
their
beer
they
just
seem
so
similiar
pretty
drinkable
i
finished
my
glass
with
ease
but
was
not
tempted
for
more
maybe
some
tap
action
will
liven
things
up
a
bit
strong
aroma
is
quite
hoppy
almost
like
an
ipa
with
woody
and
malty
tones
and
a
hint
of
citrus
it
pours
a
lovely
slightly
hazy
mahogany
with
a
decent
light
tan
head
flavor
is
hoppy
and
woody
with
a
malty
undertone
and
a
dash
of
sour
citrus
there
is
also
a
subtle
alcohol
bite
texture
is
fairly
smooth
edgy
and
tingly
chalk
up
another
win
to
lagunitas
thins
a
tad
down
bottle
in
a
nice
way
this
stuff
just
flows
great
pricing

i
was
glad
that
lagunitas
came
out
with
an
india
brown
ale
because
id
been
quite
curious
about
the
style
for
some
time
and
there
were
no
examples
i
could
get
my
hands
on
at

a
bomber
this
brewerys
beer
is
usually
worth
grabbing
i
dont
think
this
is
an
exception
though
it
isnt
mindblowing
or
revolutionary
its
brown
shugga
with
fewer
hops
in
my
opinion
drinkability
when
i
first
drank
this
i
thought
to
myself
this
is
the
perfect
beer
to
pair
with
a
meal
very
flavorful
without
dominating
the
tongue
of
course
you
could
sit
around
drinking
these
all
day
too
another
solid
brew
by
lagunitas
similar
to
a
few
others
ive
encountered
by
them
and
quite
likeable
by
me
even
if
they
seem
to
keep
within
the
same
flavor
profile
this
is
a
solid
strong
ale
that
has
some
nice
malty
complexity
and
barleywinelike
features
that
make
for
a
bomber
full
of
goodness
and
decent
drinkablitiy
sharp
clashing
not
bad
but
not
good
enough
to
have
again
though
at
a
reasonable
price
different
im
usually
impressed
with
this
brewery
not
so
much
here
pretty
darn
drinkable
highly
hopped
probably
the
last
glass
of
this
ill
have
i
wish
i
had
another
22
of
this
its
quite
a
good
brew
im
sure
i
will
be
purchasing
it
again
bonus
on
an
awesome
price

drinkability
this
beer
is
fun
its
well
balance
fascinating
and
totally
worth
a
try
whether
youre
a
hops
or
a
malt
lover
i
would
love
to
try
this
on
tap
but
for
a
beer
available
in
the
local
grocery
store
it
was
very
enjoyable
this
is
pretty
hoppy
then
again
this
is
lagunitas
still
i
cant
help
but
wish
for
a
little
more
of
a
malt
profile
out
of
this
one
d
pretty
nice
ale
hops
werent
as
prominent
as
i
was
expecting
but
was
a
nice
combination
would
try
again
this
beer
was
pretty
good
and
im
glad
i
picked
it
up
looking
forward
to
trying
the
other
lagunitas
in
my
haul
now
overall
this
is
a
much
better
strong
ale
than
it
is
an
american
brown
if
you
like
most
other
lagunitas
beers
chances
are
youll
be
a
fan
of
this
one
worth
a
shot
d
easy
drinking
and
well
balanced
but
doesnt
excel
at
anything
in
particular
good
but
not
something
id
really
want
more
than
one
of
poured
from
22oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
the
label
describes
this
brew
as
a
malty
robust
recovery
ale
however
when
i
popped
the
cap
on
this
bad
it
was
almost
entirely
hops
no
complaints
though
the
brew
pours
a
copperbrown
color
with
an
off
white
head
the
aroma
is
heavy
on
the
hops
with
a
touch
of
sweet
malt
taste
is
amazing
no
head
or
lacing
aroma
is
mostly
hops
off
the
bat
getting
some
brown
malts
as
it
warms
cheers
overall
i
am
really
unsure
this
is
an
imperial
brown
as
the
label
states
but
nonetheless
i
really
liked
it
if
the
majority
of
brown
ales
tasted
like
this
i
would
be
a
much
bigger
fan
of
the
style
whether
wilco
was
a
play
on
the
name
or
not
i
hope
they
appreciate
the
effort
that
was
put
into
the
creation
of
this
brew
as
it
is
worthy
of
their
and
your
immediate
attention
excellent
work
again
by
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
body
is
moderate
with
a
full
level
of
carbonation
but
not
overdone
relatively
tasty
stuff
though
different
from
expected
and
not
necessarily
in
a
bad
way
lagunitas
is
quite
experimental
and
i
dig
it
though
this
one
is
not
quite
as
tasty
of
most
of
their
nice
brews
lagunitas
outdid
themselves
with
this
limited
release
i
purchased
only
one
22
oz
bottle
and
wished
i
would
have
purchased
more
considering
the
6
price
the
appearance
was
a
clear
mahoganey
brown
with
about
a
1
finger
tan
head
the
foam
slowly
settled
leaving
a
thin
film
of
bubbles
on
the
surface
there
is
a
strong
roasted
malt
aroma
the
flavor
is
very
balanced
between
the
roasted
malt
and
the
hops
at
64
2
ibus
it
satisfies
the
cravings
for
bitterness
but
provides
the
maltiness
of
a
lager
the
bitterness
also
lingers
long
on
the
palate
the
mouthfeel
is
rather
even
not
very
sharp
on
the
tongue
medium
bodied
in
that
you
get
a
full
flavor
profile
throughout
as
opposed
to
thinner
beers
that
you
dont
know
youre
even
drinking
as
far
as
drinkability
i
could
go
back
to
this
beer
again
and
again
ill
have
to
see
where
it
may
be
on
draft
22
ounce
bottle
served
in
a
snifter
the
beer
pours
dark
brown
with
about
a
half
inch
offwhite
head
had
retention
is
ok
lacing
is
good
nice
aroma
the
beer
smells
like
chocolate
caramel
toffee
and
pine
and
citrusy
hops
the
brew
tastes
like
caramel
malt
citrus
grapefruit
and
pine
hops
bready
malt
and
some
chocolate
and
brown
sugar
great
balance
between
the
hops
and
malt
in
the
flavor
of
this
brew
although
i
think
the
hops
flavors
are
stronger
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
a
bit
slick
with
lightmoderate
carbonation
drinkability
is
excellent
its
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
i
think
this
is
a
good
overall
brew
ill
definitely
buy
this
again
especially
considering
the
low
price
i
think
it
was
just
4
99
a
bomber
thats
another
reason
i
like
lagunitas
a
lot
they
have
great
beer
at
affordable
prices
overall
a
superior
ale
bottle
home
good
strong
ale
lagunitas
decided
to
go
maltier
than
usual
with
this
beer
and
it
works
pretty
well
though
i
prefer
their
hopcentric
offerings
the
beer
pours
a
deep
reddish
brown
maybe
ruby
is
that
a
real
color
theres
not
much
head
on
my
pour
perhaps
because
im
drinking
it
a
bit
warm
the
aroma
has
a
whole
mess
of
welldeveloped
malt
notes
with
some
nice
piney
citrusy
hops
theres
a
bit
of
chocolate
but
im
getting
more
caramel
fruit
flavors
with
touches
of
rye
spice
and
nuts
the
flavor
is
a
rich
and
could
have
easily
gone
too
sweet
but
hops
and
yeast
keep
the
malt
in
check
full
thick
feel
this
beer
drinks
bigger
than
its
abv
another
nice
one
from
lagunitas
this
beer
poured
a
very
dark
clear
amber
color
and
formed
a
huge
foamy
light
tan
head
that
coated
the
glass
with
lace
as
it
subsided
a
medium
amount
of
carbonation
is
present
an
aroma
of
malt
caramel
and
chocolate
the
flavor
was
of
malt
coffee
and
hint
of
cocoa
the
body
was
fairly
light
and
the
finish
slightly
dry
yet
sweet
d
the
malt
and
hops
interaction
makes
this
a
very
interesting
beer
something
complex
enough
to
sip
slowly
yet
bitter
enough
to
drink
in
lieu
of
an
ipa
id
probably
just
drink
it
for
the
name
the
fact
that
its
delicious
makes
it
even
easier
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
medium
heavy
bodied
with
a
hint
of
bubbly
carbonation
medium
body
good
carbonation
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
this
seems
close
to
some
others
in
the
lineup
very
nice
drinkability
wellrounded
plenty
of
citrus
hop
notes
which
i
love
nice
balance
of
spicypine
hop
character
with
sweet
roasty
malts
wellhidden
abv
liked
it
a
lot
might
make
another
cameo
in
my
fridge
d
this
is
one
easy
drinking
beer
as
usual
lagunitas
does
not
disappoint
i
like
this
beer
will
definitely
have
it
again
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
drinkability
was
dinged
a
bit
since
the
alcohol
did
become
a
little
aggressive
as
it
warmed
definately
a
good
beer
overall
im
pretty
happy
how
this
drink
interplays
with
the
album
this
beer
hits
all
the
scales
high
and
low
to
allow
me
to
feel
the
album
d
i
like
this
beer
but
its
really
not
an
eye
popper
d
hop
character
dominates
how
surprising
lighter
on
tongue
than
expected
not
full
bodied
but
dangerously
drinkable
i
am
not
that
impressed
with
this
kind
of
in
the
black
ipa
vain
if
that
makes
any
sense
and
i
really
hate
that
termstyle
more
style
than
substance
not
something
i
am
going
to
get
again
taste
does
tone
it
down
a
bit
on
the
hops
for
a
lagunitas
brew
although
they
are
still
there
aplenty
loads
of
citrus
peel
and
pine
resin
lots
of
hop
flavor
without
being
overly
bitter
though
which
is
cool
malts
are
like
chocolate
biscuits
with
a
toasty
almost
burnt
aspect
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
on
the
thin
side
but
that
said
it
has
a
silky
texture
that
glides
down
the
throat
with
more
ease
than
a
7
8
beer
should
i
really
like
it
i
will
definitely
go
out
and
buy
a
couple
more
bombers
at
least
well
done
petaluma
crew
d
a
solid
beer
right
now
i
would
like
to
see
where
this
is
in
6
months
to
a
year
where
the
hops
die
down
a
bit
and
the
malt
can
come
out
the
malt
i
tasted
i
really
liked
and
i
feel
should
have
been
more
of
focal
point
of
this
beer
with
some
aging
it
could
be
a
44
5
in
taste
imo
so
its
a
beer
to
keep
an
eye
on
overall
a
very
tasty
brew
couldnt
see
drinking
much
more
than
a
bomber
but
get
some
for
sure
if
you
can
interesting
and
definately
deserves
a
try
tastes
like
a
knockoff
of
victorys
yakima
twilight
hoppy
but
restrained
with
a
burst
of
bitter
pine
sap
on
the
finish
malts
are
vinous
and
slightly
beefy
interesting
light
carbonation
struggles
to
wake
up
the
tongue
but
ultimately
this
feels
too
watery
for
the
abv
slightly
sticky
on
the
finish
with
a
lingering
hoppiness
and
brown
sugar
all
in
all
a
decent
if
predictable
release
from
lagunitas
one
and
done
for
me
but
id
still
recommend
giving
it
a
try
d
this
beers
label
is
misleading
but
the
taste
is
still
great
awesome
appearance
and
unique
taste
one
of
the
most
well
balanced
beers
in
a
while
when
i
think
about
it
good
drinkability
on
this
one
not
the
most
exciting
beer
but
an
easy
one
to
drink
and
enjoyable
enough
on
a
side
note
their
label
cracks
me
up
again
im
loving
their
current
events
theme
theyve
had
going
with
other
seasonal
releases
what
a
nice
surprise
found
this
on
tap
a
local
place
here
in
baltimore
just
bursting
with
flavor
ive
only
recently
begun
to
appreciate
hoppiness
in
beer
the
hops
come
through
but
so
did
a
nice
underlying
fruitiness
crisp
and
very
drinkable
would
definitely
drink
again
i
picked
up
a
bottle
for
8
from
abes
cold
beer
so
this
is
basically
an
imperial
brown
of
sorts
right
how
about
thats
what
the
label
is
hinting
at
i
thought
id
like
this
beer
but
it
just
couldnt
catch
on
i
got
very
little
malt
character
and
while
the
cirtus
fruit
punch
hops
were
delicious
the
only
other
thing
i
tasted
was
a
medicinal
candy
taste
that
was
more
odd
than
unpleasant
i
wouldnt
recommend
this
beer
while
lagunitas
gets
the
hops
right
theres
little
balance
from
barley
22
ounce
bomber
poured
into
a
unibroue
tulip
big
fluffy
offwhite
head
bursting
with
juicy
aromas
grapefruit
dominates
the
smell
some
malt
sweetness
stunning
just
stunning
taste
follows
suit
with
bitter
hop
goodness
with
a
nice
malt
balance
leaning
towards
the
bitter
awesome
delicious
if
your
in
the
mood
for
hops
delicious
if
your
in
the
mood
for
malt
tastes
great
looks
great
feels
great
smells
great
and
if
it
could
speak
im
sure
it
would
have
the
voice
of
an
angel
d
makes
a
good
sipper
worth
checking
out
and
with
lagunitas
pricing
its
a
pretty
good
value
id
be
interested
to
see
how
this
one
ages
in
conclusion
i
am
pretty
confused
to
what
i
would
classify
this
beer
it
is
similar
to
a
dipa
or
barleywine
well
not
quite
barley
wine
but
a
lighter
version
i
heard
its
a
brown
ale
but
i
dont
think
i
ever
had
a
brown
ale
like
this
solid
and
really
recommended
overall
an
very
nice
beer
for
this
style
i
was
originally
drawn
to
this
beer
due
to
the
name
i
love
wilco
but
the
beer
is
definitely
very
good
a
nice
innovative
beer
from
a
great
brewery
great
beer
will
buy
again
d
for
the
price
the
petaluma
crew
has
done
a
great
job
with
this
beer
toasty
malty
notes
of
a
strong
brown
ale
are
intertwined
with
juicy
tropical
fruits
a
unique
combo
for
sure
seriously
malty
flavors
toasty
and
somewhat
rich
fading
into
some
herbal
bitterness
and
sweetish
citrus
fruits
malt
seems
to
dominate
though
the
hop
bitterness
holds
its
ground
low
and
even
carbonation
levels
full
and
round
feel
easy
to
drink
a
bomber
certainly
worth
a
try
cheers
overall
its
not
a
bad
offering
but
i
cant
say
im
a
big
fan
its
not
aggressively
hoppy
enough
to
be
a
west
coast
hop
bomb
the
malt
isnt
really
sweet
enough
to
make
this
a
typical
brown
ale
and
the
combination
of
the
two
comes
out
more
conflicted
than
balanced
the
taste
is
big
and
malty
with
a
fair
amount
of
citrusy
hops
to
balance
it
out
nice
caramel
notes
seem
to
pop
out
as
the
beer
warms
medium
to
mediumlight
bodied
carbination
seems
to
be
about
right
easy
to
drink
a
little
warm
alcohol
in
the
taste
is
well
done
not
too
much
but
enough
to
let
you
know
its
there
side
note
ive
also
had
this
on
tap
at
the
lagunitas
brewery
in
petaluma
they
taste
almost
identical
though
the
hops
were
just
slightly
more
obvious
on
tap
the
smell
was
citrusy
and
lovely
definitely
a
hop
that
i
enjoy
the
taste
was
malty
and
had
delicious
caramel
backbone
to
it
i
found
it
to
be
a
money
brew
that
went
down
smooth
i
would
definitely
get
it
again

solid
mass
of
thick

clings
to
the
side
of
the

s
the
aroma
has
a
very
smooth
and
tropical
fruitlike
sweetness
some
pineapple
and
possibly
tangerine
just
the
faintest
hint
of
something
medicinal
heavy
caramel
and
molasses
one
of
the
most
inviting
aromas
ive
experienced
in
some
time

d
nice
effortless
hop
bite
that
avoids
being
harsh
well
balanced
though
teetering
on
the
side
of
hops
caramel
sweetness
lots
of
grapefruit
and
a
hint
of
pine
if
i
had
to
guess
i
would
say
centennial
hops
were
involved
in
this
beer

smooth

a
very
nicely

up

just

this
is
a
great
beer
and
at

for
a

its
a
steal
lagunitas
has
scored
again
great
taste
with
a
cold
malty
and
smoked
flavor
which
is
well
balanced
by
the
carbonation
hidden
within
the
taste
lingers
for
a
bit
but
is
not
astringency
and
leaves
you
wanting
more
over
all
another
great
from
lagookneetas
what
ive
always
waited
for
a
brown
ale
with
the
robust
resiny
hoppiness
of
an
ipa
and
a
touch
of
peat
like
a
scottish
ale
body
is
near
perfect
for
this
hybrid
which
is
extremely
drinkable
and
the
finish
is
of
moderate
duration
theres
even
some
berry
in
the
flavor
profile
a
really
interesting
experiment
that
lagunitas
pulled
off
quite
well
it
pours
a
clear
deep
brown
with
an
almost
imperceptable
red
hue
topped
with
a
thin
umber
foam
a
sweet
meaty
aroma
is
intoxicating
by
itself
initial
flavors
are
of
caramel
malt
and
sweet
alcohol
with
a
nutty
infusion
it
is
very
balanced
with
a
nice
underpinning
of
fruity
hops
wtf
has
a
very
confusing
and
dark
spectrum
that
makes
you
feel
like
something
is
wrong
but
it
doesnt
matter
because
it
tastes
so
right
its
like
they
took
the
best
of
brown
shugga
and
hairy
eyeball
to
make
wtf
a
unique
brew
to
challenge
the
taste
buds
and
sip
after
a
long
day
at
work
or
looking
for
work
as
the
bottle
goes
overall
this
is
a
successful
beer
doesnt
blow
my
mind
except
for
the
fact
that
they
balanced
such
an
prominant
hop
line
up
with
such
a
strong
dark
malt
bill
mmm
good
job
lagunitas
drinkability
is
good
a
robust
hoppy
brown
thats
smooth
and
satisfying
i
bet
this
will
age
well
and
at
lagunitass
usual
great
price
theres
no
reason
not
to
try
d
very
smooth
and
well
balanced
for
the
abv
this
is
very
very
drinkable
just
enough
bitterness
from
the
hops
in
the
finish
to
make
it
crisp
and
linger
but
not
overpowering
i
really
like
what
lagunitas
did
here
and
i
love
this
style
i
would
definitely
recommend
not
cellaring
this
beer
and
drinking
it
fresh
if
it
were
up
to
me
there
would
be
many
many
more
hoppy
american
brown
ales
well
done
drinkability
is
good
this
is
an
interesting
brownstrong
ale
some
classic
brown
flavors
with
a
nice
kick
at
the
end
very
good
beer
certainly
worth
a
try
i
love
this
beer
its
something
that
warms
you
up
when
its
cold
outside
but
gives
you
that
sigh
of
relief
when
you
have
had
a
hard
day
to
not
something
that
you
would
really
want
to
drink
more
than
two
of
at
a
time
because
of
strong
flavors
that
can
ruin
a
palate
if
you
want
to
drink
or
taste
anything
else
for
the
next
few
hours
beerandwhiskeyhq
com
o
bursts
of
sweet
and
spice
malt
and
hops
wonderfully
bold
and
hearty
enjoyable
but
a
bit
too
sugary
sweet
and
i
reached
my
limit
on
sweetness
halfway
thru
all
the
sugars
mellowed
out
completely
leaving
it
with
an
almost
woody
flavor
which
is
awesome
because
my
biggest
complaint
with
it
right
of
the
shelf
was
that
it
was
way
to
sweet
and
really
hard
to
drink
still
a
bigger
fan
of
the
mondo
red
but
if
you
come
across
an
old
bottle
its
def
worth
grabbing
and
letting
it
sit
a
while
lagunitas
comes
through
again
with
a
beer
that
is
full
flavored
hoppy
and
reasonably
priced
way
to
go
serving
type
bottle
a
simple
review
would
be
to
say
the
lucky
13
alt
is
another
excellent
lagunitas
beer
with
the
trademark
big
hops
with
a
touch
of
sweetness
but
thats
too
easy
the
lagunitas
lucky
13
alt
is
an
alternative
take
on
their
lucky
13
imperial
red
ale
that
pours
a
dark
dirty
blonde
with
plenty
of
hops
in
the
aroma
the
initial
taste
was
like
biting
into
a
big
juicy
grapefruit
that
kept
my
mouth
watering
and
wanting
more
there
was
a
light
malt
on
the
end
that
adds
a
lingering
sweetness
but
it
was
the
big
sweet
grapefruit
flavors
that
kept
me
coming
back
lagunutas
crafts
a
wide
array
of
ales
and
this
one
is
most
unlike
their
other
efforts
not
an
everyday
beer
but
this
is
perfect
for
the
paleipa
drinker
that
wants
to
mix
it
up
a
little
get
this
in
the
mix
instead
of
that
iipa
the
body
is
medium
with
a
certain
thickness
and
its
a
tad
clunky
maybe
a
little
slick
and
somewhat
lacking
finesse
i
think
lagunitas
was
looking
for
the
beer
is
good
because
its
strong
people
overall
though
its
better
than
a
lot
out
there
overall
a
very
respectable
american
stron
ale
very
unique
in
its
color
and
taste
compared
to
the
traditional
bunch
e
g
arrogant
bastard
would
be
interested
to
try
a
double
asa
version
of
this
my
favorite
is
still
double
bastard
o
this
is
quite
enjoyable
it
doesnt
look
or
taste
much
like
a
blonde
ale
but
it
disappeared
pretty
quickly
recommended
o
overall
a
good
beer
but
if
this
one
has
had
the
malt
turned
down
versus
the
lucky
13
im
almost
worried
to
try
that
although
the
originals
alcohol
is
a
bit
lower
given
the
nose
the
palatemouthfeel
are
just
a
bit
too
much
and
i
think
the
hops
could
be
bumped
up
a
bit
to
add
a
bit
of
crispness
to
the
thickness
poured
into
a
pint
glass
o
a
pretty
tasty
example
of
the
style
and
ill
have
another
please
a
good
price
helps
o
a
great
looking
beer
with
drinkability
at
8
8
abv
overall
its
thick
flavorful
and
interesting
i
would
consider
it
more
of
a
novelty
beer
to
be
enjoyed
occasionally
than
an
everyday
drinker
youve
kinda
gotta
commit
to
this
one
when
you
pop
the
cap
overall
a
rather
sweet
but
tasty
none
the
less
ipa
with
an
easy
drinking
style
while
not
quite
up
to
the
traditional
lucky
13
it
was
an
interesting
take
and
is
well
worth
the
try
if
you
get
a
chance
another
nice
beer
from
lagunitas
this
would
probably
be
my
end
of
summer
beginning
of
fall
beer
i
taste
a
lot
of
orange
and
citrus
hops
defined
by
a
midpoint
bitterness
and
held
together
by
a
pleasant
caramel
malt
character
theres
a
malty
sweet
finish
a
beer
big
enough
for
the
hop
head
in
me
but
malty
enough
for
those
who
shy
from
the
lupulin
o
definitely
an
interesting
beer
that
does
not
seem
to
fight
into
any
style
very
well
i
like
the
presence
of
the
hops
and
the
alcohol
is
fairly
well
hidden
this
is
a
big
beer
and
is
much
more
of
a
sipper
than
an
easy
drinker
o
great
beer
it
smells
great
and
tastes
better
i
love
the
balance
between
the
bitter
citrus
hops
and
bready
sweet
malts
i
would
have
liked
more
carbonation
in
short
a
very
very
good
beer
highly
enjoyable
overall
great
for
its
type
i
am
sure
not
usually
my
preferred
style
but
ill
try
any
lagunitas
i
suppose
if
you
paired
it
with
the
right
food
it
would
be
better
suited
but
i
like
a
brew
that
is
able
to
stand
on
its
own
so
thats
how
i
judge
them
really
liked
this
beer
i
really
didnt
even
know
what
type
it
was
when
i
bought
it
and
found
out
home
when
i
checked
beer
advocate
hiding
the
rating
with
my
hand
of
course
another
good
beer
from
lagunitas
o
this
beer
held
up
really
well
im
surprised
and
happy
with
this
bottle
a
great
beer
by
itself
but
as
an
imperial
blonde
this
was
awesome
pours
a
golden
light
copper
with
a
little
over
a
finger
of
foam
not
too
bad
of
retention
equal
lacing
tiny
suspended
shards
of
yeast
cloud
the
beer
interesting
gives
an
unfiltered
look
doesnt
detract
the
score
much
maybe
the
bottles
just
old
smells
pretty
good
spicy
hops
with
a
good
citrus
undertone
caramel
malts
with
a
touch
of
alcohol
all
come
together
quire
nicely
taste
translates
well
spicy
caramel
hop
resins
having
the
most
flavor
followed
by
the
roasted
malts
not
much
of
the
citrus
as
in
the
smell
but
is
definitely
detectable
everything
balances
nicely
very
enjoyable
body
is
good
too
crisp
and
dry
with
a
medium
body
overall
really
good
not
very
familiar
with
the
style
but
it
seems
pretty
hop
dominant
for
a
strongimperial
blond
ale
which
is
good
news
to
someone
who
drink
mostly
ipas
like
me
glad
i
picked
this
up
not
great
honestly
i
think
this
beer
made
me
a
little
sick
my
first
strong
ale
a
catchall
category
as
indicated
on
ba
i
dont
care
how
it
looks
an
ipa
i
guess
smells
malt
forward
and
sweet
and
maybe
some
floral
hops
taste
is
whew
sweet
and
roasted
nuts
and
ripe
fruit
the
malt
backbone
masking
some
middle
hops
interestingly
as
the
sweet
wears
off
the
hops
that
were
once
hidden
seem
to
come
forward
a
bit
mouthfeel
is
ok
and
so
is
the
carbonation
and
the
mouthfeel
is
more
on
the
dipa
side
of
syrupy
but
not
too
much
overall
too
much
malt
for
me
wishing
that
the
hops
were
up
in
volume
still
fun
to
try
overall
4
0
falls
slightly
short
of
4
5
but
is
an
excellent
brew
it
really
takes
you
on
a
swirling
journey
of
all
the
things
that
make
beer
great
hops
malt
and
magic
i
would
recommend
this
beer
if
you
can
find
it
the
8
8
abv
is
completely
unnoticeable
and
as
this
baby
is
so
sessionable
hope
you
have
tomorrow
morning
off
from
your
job
as
a
brain
surgeon
buy
it
o
excellent
brew
great
combo
of
the
hops
and
malt
and
enough
alcohol
to
make
it
interesting
im
a
fan
o
a
rather
pleasant
easy
drinking
strong
ale
lagunitas
makes
some
good
sweet
beers
and
this
one
lives
up
to
it
one
worth
picking
up
if
you
like
a
sweet
imperial
beer
that
is
nice
and
citrusy
i
did
find
this
beer
enjoyable
but
it
had
a
weird
alcohol
flavor
on
it
wish
the
alcohol
presence
was
not
so
noticeable
because
it
distracted
from
the
other
great
flavors
oh
well
cheers
o
one
of
my
favorite
ales
of
2012
i
highly
recommend
this
one
may
release
overall
this
was
a
really
nice
brew
the
nose
and
flavor
dont
really
match
here
as
the
hop
aromas
advertise
a
totally
different
ride
but
thats
not
to
say
the
ride
itself
wasnt
an
enjoyable
one
a
beer
id
defintely
drink
again
thanks
again
for
sharing
doops
o
i
cant
find
any
fault
with
this
beer
really
the
quality
and
craftsmanship
are
there
and
its
certainly
tasty
enough
i
am
personally
just
not
moved
by
it
in
my
mind
theres
just
a
been
there
done
that
type
of
feeling
as
i
drink
this
im
not
sure
if
its
just
me
but
every
lagunitas
beer
seems
to
have
the
same
house
taste
especially
in
the
hop
profile
and
i
just
get
bored
with
them
sometimes
thats
not
to
say
that
theyre
bad
beers
i
thoroughly
enjoy
them
when
im
in
the
mood
i
just
wish
theyd
venture
out
and
make
a
beer
thats
more
of
a
departure
for
them
maybe
take
a
risk
every
now
and
then
maybe
im
being
a
little
unfair
its
still
a
fine
beer
and
well
worth
a
drink
o
loving
it
would
order
another
and
buy
again
what
a
deal
lagunitas
bombers
are
4
49
alcohol
comes
through
late
in
the
first
pint
not
sessionable
overall
im
not
too
incredibly
wowed
by
this
one
but
lagunitas
has
my
respect
for
pushing
the
boundaries
of
what
a
quality
american
strong
ale
can
be
if
they
worked
on
the
yeast
attenuation
a
bit
more
the
alcohol
could
get
a
wee
boost
and
more
importantly
the
overall
sweet
character
could
get
a
much
needed
reduction
a
big
sweet
ipa
it
pours
clear
brassy
color
with
a
small
white
head
that
doesnt
last
long
at
all
it
smells
like
hops
and
caramel
malts
tons
of
residual
sugars
and
a
fair
bit
of
alcohol
it
tastes
really
hoppy
and
i
would
certainly
categorize
it
as
such
the
hops
are
fresh
and
sweeter
and
the
malt
adds
even
more
sweetness
it
sticks
to
the
teeth
and
feels
like
a
cavity
waiting
to
happen
the
aftertaste
has
some
bitter
bite
to
it
but
its
too
little
too
late
in
my
opinion
medium
body
and
mellow
carbonation
but
the
feel
is
ruined
by
the
sugar
its
worth
it
for
5
bucks
a
bomber
but
it
isnt
anything
special
appearance
is
amber
with
a
hint
of
gold
head
is
relatively
light
and
disappates
somewhat
quickly
to
a
thin
ring
around
the
edge
of
the
glass
mouthfeel
is
ok
smell
is
heavy
hops
despite
just
a
60
ibu
sweeter
malts
and
sugars
help
enhance
the
hoppy
flavor
which
i
get
mostly
spices
from
citrus
is
present
maybe
from
grapefruit
a
big
sweet
ipa
it
pours
clear
brassy
color
with
a

a

but
it
isnt

special
pours
a
mostly
clear
amber
color
with
a
slightly
offwhite
head
the
scent
is
yeasty
mixed
with
citrus
and
malts
taste
is
bold
and
delicious
it
is
a
mixture
of
sweet
malts
and
bitter
hops
creating
a
unique
blend
that
finishes
slightly
dry
smooth
refreshing
and
fulfilling
for
an
overall
great
beer
not
too
sure
about
this
one
wellmade
but
straddles
the
line
between
a
barley
wine
a
dipa
and
well
i
suppose
the
flavours
are
kind
of
altish
worth
a
try
a
really
good
beer
i
was
surprised
by
the
big
malty
note
but
i
think
the
hops
complemented
nicely
a
fairly
unique
beer
that
i
think
worked
overall
o
good
beer
kinda
makes
me
think
of
a
barleywine
delicious
o
not
many
breweries
do
these
west
coaststyle
hop
bombs
like
lagunitas
and
i
like
their
alternative
try
it
and
see
if
you
think
im
crazy
if
you
do
all
i
can
say
is
you
are
taking
the
same
position
as
my
wife
my
boss
and
a
bunch
of
other
people
you
wouldnt
want
to
be
on
the
same
side
with
wonderful
brew
well
worth
a
pickup
good
mix
of
style
elements
wonderful
to
drink
a
real
craft
brew
lagunitas
always
delivers
it
also
continues
lagunitas
tradition
of
being
able
to
finesse
rather
voluptuous
beers
into
very
slimfitting
attire
i
suppose
given
the
label
such
an
analogy
is
appropriate
as
the
beer
gets
fully
warm
its
bosoms
begin
to
spill
out
a
little
but
the
blonde
cannot
be
faulted
for
that
o
this
is
just
a
great
beer
i
have
bought
this
probably
20
times
and
it
never
gets
old
i
just
wish
this
beer
was
year
round
o
i
cant
believe
it
took
me
song
long
to
pick
this
up
for
4
99
im
an
idiot
lagunitas
is
oneof
those
brewerys
that
i
often
overlook
for
no
good
reason
almost
everything
they
do
is
damn
good
gonna
grab
a
few
more
of
these
before
they
dissapear
oa
decent
strong
ale
but
needs
a
little
more
balance
for
me
o
a
great
brew
with
nice
drinkability
at
8
9
overall
not
as
good
as
i
remember
when
i
had
it
on
sample
still
a
solid
beer
that
i
dont
believe
benefits
from
the
high
alcohol
content
a
very
luxurious
beer
and
at
the
time
dangerously
drinkable
well
done
will
pour
a
five
finger
cream
head
that
fades
very
slowly
leaving
a
good
lace
crystal
clear
copperamber
color
medium
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
citrus
hop
nose
and
flavor
is
citrus
hops
and
caramel
very
similar
to
a
double
ipa
5
79
for
a
22oz
bottle
from
beverage
warehouse
winooski
vt
o
it
seems
like
the
more
i
drink
the
hops
fade
and
the
biscuit
comes
through
its
like
an
imperial
pale
ale
overall
very
drinkable
big
beer
malts
hops
and
alcohol
are
big
but
balanced
overall
pretty
good
i
liked
most
the
taste
full
of
flavor
and
the
sweet
malts
were
definitely
offset
by
the
bitter
hope
not
my
favorite
lagunitas
brew
but
definitely
one
to
enjoy
as
a
treat
once
in
awhile
cant
see
myself
drinking
more
than
22
oz
s
of
it
though
smells
of
crazy
citrus
and
fruit
hops
and
caramel
malts
taste
is
fruity
citrus
and
mango
hops
with
slight
malty
sweetness
its
not
as
complex
as
i
hoped
but
still
tasty
although
id
compare
it
more
towards
a
malty
dipa
delicious
the
first
time
i
tried
this
beer
i
really
liked
it
i
have
had
it
several
times
now
and
each
time
i
try
it
i
think
yeah

it

what
i
liked

about

the

this
is
a
pretty
bold
if
simple
beer
brash
malt
and
hops
collide
but
end
up
blending
nicely
balanced
but
not
in
the
english
mildmannered
sort
of
way
enjoyed
this
one
pours
a
slightly
hazed
deepgold
an
offwhite
headring
clumps
around
the
glass
smell
is
very
leafy
and
foodlike
like
decomposing
vegetation
the
yeast
strikes
again
taste
starts
off
nice
and
hoppy
melding
into
smooth
malts
that
detritus
taste
again
and
high
sweetness
very
sweet
finish
along
with
a
new
wave
of
pleasant
bitterness
a
little
heat
but
the
abv
is
masked
well
very
good
beer
i
like
lagunitas
offerings
and
this
one
doesnt
disappoint
at
all
o
very
tasty
beer
but
considering
the
broadness
of
a
strong
ale
i
think
this
one
might
be
a
bit
more
like
an
ipa
or
a
dipa
the
hops
are
the
star
in
this
beer
in
my
opinion
d
for
all
the
alcohol
in
this
beer
its
hidden
very
well
drinks
nicely
i
wish
i
bought
a
case
a
very
drinkable
brew
with
some
of
the
notes
of
little
sumpin
sumpin
overall
a
decent
malt
bomb
definitely
on
the
sweet
side
the
peppery
spice
and
yeasty
funk
could
be
a
little
more
pronounced
for
my
taste
this
one
is
good
but
not
great
for
the
abv
this
is
scary
drinkable
bitter
and
sweet
the
fruity
hop
character
is
a
nice
change
of
pace
the
malt
character
adds
fantastic
balance
this
is
yet
another
awesome
lagunitas
offering
opicked
it
up
thinking
i
was
grabbing
lucky
13
and
came
away
pleasantly
surprised
o
well
put
together
beer
but
i
would
buy
this
again
for
the
price
i
have
to
pay
overall
honestly
im
not
a
fan
of
this
beer
i
find
it
a
bit
rough
around
the
edges
and
hard
to
drink
not
recommended
interesting
beer
definitely
an
ipa
style
beer
has
some
sweetness
throughout
caramel
brown
sugar
ix
minimal
but
balanced
nicely
with
the
loaded
citrus
hops
pours
golden
with
some
lacing
head
good
beer
i
would
defiantly
drink
this
again
only
knock
is
again
most
of
their
beers
have
a
similar
taste
for
what
its
worth
i
remember
enjoying
this
on
tap
a
lot
more
than
this
bottled
version
pours
a
clear
golden
orange
with
a
1
inch
puffy
orangewhite
head
that
settles
to
a
thin
cap
foamy
rings
of
lace
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
grapefruit
grapefruit
juice
and
citrus
zest
extremely
citrus
forward
aromas
taste
is
also
very
citrus
forward
with
big
grapefruit
flavors
up
front
with
citrus
zest
on
the
finish
some
sweet
malt
is
apparent
in
the
taste
as
well
very
mild
hop
bitterness
quickly
fades
from
the
palate
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
nice
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
with
awesome
citrus
aromas
and
tastes
a
great
deal
for
the
4
50
i
paid
for
the
bomber
this
is
a
pretty
smooth
offering
for
8
9
abv
the
mouthfeel
is
great
and
it
is
getting
better
as
it
warms
up
a
bit

is
high
very
good
lacing
around
the

as
i
drink

this
beer
for
a

pours
a
deep
ambery
orange
color
with
a
quick
disappearing
white
head
big
juicy
hop
aroma
and
a
hint
of
apricot
jam
nice
mouthfeel
with
low
carbonation
tastes
exactly
as
it
smells
nice
and
hoppy
but
not
overly
bitter
defiantly
go
out
and
give
this
one
a
try
do
this
beer
is
practically
a
recreation
of
lagunitas
spring
strong
ale
undercover
investigation
shutdown
full
of
alltoocommon
features
such
as
pungent
and
underattenuated
grain
that
drowns
out
even
what
was
likely
a
robust
hop
bill
its
signature
lagunitas
qualities
could
be
detected
by
a
beerobsessed
shark
from
three
miles
away
o
impressive
i
was
not
expecting
this
from
this
brew
nice
pickup
bevmo
happy
i
purchased
the
bottle
youre
getting
better
still
love
my
locallyowned
shop
better
though
o
extremely
drinkable
in
spite
of
big
flavours
warms
the
insides
and
makes
me
smile
o
an
excellent
outing
its
like
if
arrogant
bastard
got
over
itself
went
to
the
beach
for
some
sun
and
realized
it
didnt
have
to
try
so
hard
in
this
world
that
things
are
already
pretty
good
as
they
are
finish
is
very
long
bitter
grapefruit
skin
with
hints
of
pine
all
around
a
wonderfully
drinkable
and
consumer
friendly
brew
this
could
be
a
daily
beer
for
me
if
i
had
a
daily
beer
pretty
decent
overall
kinda
reminds
me
of
hopslam
othis
is
basically
an
ipa
now
im
aware
that
strong
ale
are
often
quite
hoppy
but
this
just
has
all
ipa
characteristics
and
misses
some
of
those
extra
flavors
found
in
strong
ales
as
an
ipa
its
average
o
solid
beer
but
they
should
get
rid
of
the
alt
tag
very
interesting
brew
grade
a
mild
carbonation
nice
beer
but
a
bit
hoppy
for
an
alt
22oz
bottle
orangeamber
color
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
since
the
label
had
alt
on
it
but
this
was
no
german
beer
by
any
means
it
smelled
hoppy
and
tasted
like
a
hoppy
strong
ale
overall
it
wasnt
great
but
it
wasnt
bad
a
very
good
value
for
4
and
about
what
id
expect
i
think
i
liked
the
regular
lucky
13
more
o
very
consumable
tasty
and
compelling
recommended
i
liked
it
and
would
have
one
again
and
again
d
lagunitas
never
disappoints
me
a
very
nice
brew
big
big
hops
this
is
a
really
nice
easy
drink
not
overly
complex
but
it
doesnt
need
to
be
it
hit
the
spot
on
a
late
summer
night
recommended
i
might
have
liked
this
if
i
hadnt
ever
had
a
lagunitas
strong
ale
before
but
i
have
and
they
all
sort
of
start
to
run
together
as
just
slight
variants
of
the
same
beer
not
that
it
makes
it
bad
but
its
not
breaking
any
new
ground
either
no
big
departure
for
lagunitas
except
maybe
for
that
mild
but
lingering
herbal
character
if
it
aint
broke
dont
fix
it
i
guess
a
really
tasty
ale
smells
like
fresh
pineapple
juice
with
a
tinge
of
maple
syrup
the
taste
is
relatively
sweet
but
nowhere
near
cloying
there
is
a
nice
allaround
bitterness
that
balances
out
the
sweetness
the
pineapple
was
more
present
in
the
nose
but
still
comes
through
in
the
taste
there
is
a
nice
grapefruit
as
well
the
carbonation
is
good
and
the
body
is
medium
this
could
easily
be
described
as
a
dipa
and
i
prefer
a
little
sumpin
sumpin
just
a
tad
more
this
is
a
very
impressive
ale
and
i
will
go
enjoy
my
second
glass
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
smooth
the
color
when
poured
into
a
pint
glass
was
of
a
golden
yellow
with
an
orange
hue
the
smell
was
the
usual
piney
aroma
but
with
a
hint
of
yeast
the
taste
was
of
fresh
pine
neddles
with
a
hint
of
yeast
and
orange
citrus
after
each
sip
or
gulp
as
the
ale
settled
on
the
palate
the
bitter
the
mouth
palate
felt
over
all
it
was
just
a
touch
above
average
for
my
palate
not
what
i
would
purchase
again
o
great
stong
ale
would
definitely
buy
again
and
again
stared
at
this
one
on
the
shelf
long
enough
time
to
buy
and
try
it
pours
a
clear
brass
topped
by
a
solid
finger
of
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
grapefruit
zest
caramel
honey
light
maple
syrup
and
a
decent
amount
of
flaky
biscuits
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
the
grapefruit
and
newcoming
pine
taking
center
stage
whilst
the
sweeter
and
breadier
notes
surrounding
them
closely
snugly
the
body
is
a
lightleaning
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
kinda
syrupy
feel
overall
a
very
pleasing
beer
with
impeccable
balance
good
times
sips
of
malt
and
sips
of
hops
a
great
marriage
above
average
mouthfeel
lasting
generous
white
head
on
cloudy
golden
body
apricot
and
grapefruit
citrus
bread
and
alcohol
very
drinkable
a
wonderful
accompanyment
to
supper
good
for
west
coast
spin
on
style
i
havent
had
the
regular
13th
anniversary
since
i
dont
like
reds
but
picked
this
up
since
it
was
nicely
priced
the
smell
reminded
me
a
little
of
an
esb
but
the
taste
was
more
of
a
ipa
variation
another
pretty
good
beer
from
lagunitas
o
too
bad
its
a
oneoff
its
delicious
all
in
all
very
enjoyable
but
the
8
9
abv
does
come
across
a
little
boozy
many
layers
of
complexity
very
happy
with
this
one
another
quality
brew
from
lagunitas
22

an

a

hops
win
in
the
end
though
ok
on
the
palate
the
two
immense
competitors
meld
well
a
good
beer
but
not
one
of
lagunitas
best
overall
this
reminds
me
very
much
of
an
india
pale
ale
but
a
mild
one
at
that
the
alcohol
is
hidden
very
well
i
barely
noticed
that
i
was
enjoying
a
8
9
abv
very
pleased
to
have
had
this
twice
if
i
were
to
see
some
sitting
on
the
shelf
i
would
definitely
purchase
again
especially
for
4
49
per
bottle
but
not
look
for
it
specifically
o
very
drinkable
and
very
dangerous
i
enjoyed
this
and
wish
i
could
try
the
original
of
the
lucky
13
definitely
would
like
to
get
more
of
this
overall
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
style
but
some
one
who
is
would
like
the
price
point
of
this
beer
and
drink
a
lot
of
it
edit
upon
reading
some
of
the
other
reviews
afterwards
im
actually
going
to
reiterate
this
not
intended
to
be
an
altbier
its
just
a
highgrav
retooling
of
the
original
lucky
13
o
a
solid
beer
definitely
worth
trying
i
always
liked
lucky
13
as
a
red
but
this
is
a
great
variation
not
overhopped
though
it
did
seem
so
at
first
like
a
lot
of
lagunitas
but
a
pleasant
flavor
and
an
easy
drinking
big
beer
a
quick
clean
taste
that
really
did
not
have
much
of
a
follow
though
to
it
it
really
kinda
was
dominated
by
the
cereal
grains
and
earthy
bread
like
malts
that
drown
out
anything
else
that
might
have
been
trying
to
make
a
run
at
coming
forward
very
smooth
with
a
crisp
clean
finish
not
a
ton
of
carbnation
and
the
body
itself
was
very
light
very
nice
actually
as
there
was
nothing
really
holding
you
back
from
having
multiples
of
this
low
abv
and
a
very
smooth
flavor
with
a
crisp
finish
overall
a
really
nice
brew
to
celebrate
a
milestone
for
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
pours
a
golden
amber
color
with
a
thin
off
white
head
that
left
plenty
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
like
candy
lots
of
caramel
and
juicy
fruity
hops
the
taste
is
bitter
up
front
with
some
piney
hops
sweet
caramel
malt
a
little
toasted
malt
and
a
bitter
lemony
finish
the
beer
is
kind
of
heavy
at
first
but
the
finish
seems
lighter
the
carbonation
is
on
point
and
it
has
a
nice
dry
finish
i
would
drink
this
again
seems
more
like
an
ipa
to
me
though
overall
this
beer
is
enjoyable
they
should
make
this
one
again
22
ounce
bottle
into
snifter
pours
crystal
clear
orangish
golden
amber
color
with
a
dense
1
finger
off
white
head
with
great
retention
that
reduces
to
a
fairly
thick
lacing
cap
nice
amount
of
thick
lacing
clings
to
the
glass
as
well
aromas
of
big
pine
orange
lemon
grapefruit
breadiness
caramel
and
molasses
very
nice
and
complex
aromas
with
nice
strength
taste
is
tons
of
orange
lemon
caramel
pine
honey
breadiness
and
a
bit
of
spiciness
as
well
nice
amount
of
bitterness
on
the
finish
that
lingers
with
caramel
citrus
and
pine
flavors
with
some
nice
sweetness
in
there
as
well
insanely
balanced
beer
with
just
the
right
amount
of
sweetness
and
overall
great
balance
of
all
flavors
throughout
insanely
smooth
drinking
for
being
almost
9
with
a
slightly
creamy
mouthfeel
alcohol
is
basically
invisible
only
a
a
slight
warming
after
the
finish
noticed
medium
carbonation
and
mediumfull
bodied
overall
an
absolutely
outstanding
offering
from
lagunitas
so
much
well
balanced
flavor
oh
my
i
like
this
brew
very
surprised
at
this
beer
nice
hop
profile
and
the
bitterness
is
great
never
knew
an
alt
could
taste
like
this
o
i
dare
lagunitas
to
make
a
beer
i
dont
like
i
dont
think
they
can
this
beer
is
like
an
american
barleywine
light
not
quite
as
heavy
but
similar
taste
characteristics
o
this
is
a
great
beer
maybe
one
of
my
favorites
has
a
bit
of
a
sweetness
to
it
but
its
balanced
well
by
the
hops
pours
a
deep
golden
color
with
a
good
sized
fluffy
white
head
that
shows
great
retention
and
lace
aromas
of
citrus
and
pine
waft
from
the
bottle
the
second
it
is
opened
sweet
toffee
and
caramel
malt
backbone
hold
this
one
up
quite
well
taste
is
citrus
and
pine
up
front
sweet
caramel
and
burnt
sugar
pop
in
for
a
second
somewhere
in
the
middle
the
hops
take
over
the
finish
and
dance
for
a
second
with
a
touch
of
ethanol
the
malty
sweetness
is
almost
approaching
maibock
here
but
the
hops
are
powerful
enough
to
keep
that
in
check
medium
body
and
level
of
carbonation
resinous
and
sweet
sticky
mouthfeel
this
is
nice
i
liked
it
its
a
bit
different
but
i
really
enjoyed
it
another
good
beer
from
lagunitas
its
right
in
their
normal
wheelhouse
despite
the
whole
alt
angle
pours
bright
orange
with
a
dissipating
white
head
hops
are
strong
and
provide
a
big
citrus
and
spruce
flavor
theres
some
light
sugary
vinous
complexity
as
well
but
im
not
sure
where
its
coming
from
the
beer
has
a
definite
sugary
candy
cane
note
with
deeper
caramel
sticking
more
to
the
background
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
round
the
taste
starts
sweet
with
lots
of
delicate
hoppiness
and
ends
with
a
healthy
but
relatively
gentle
bitterness
its
deceptively
easy
to
drink
for
the
abv
and
theres
very
little
stickiness
or
booze
to
it
once
again
lagunitas
has
made
a
strong
hoppy
and
delicious
beer
it
might
run
together
a
bit
with
some
of
their
other
offerings
but
that
doesnt
mean
its
any
less
delicious
o
i
liked
this
beer
although
i
would
put
it
in
the
lower
half
of
lagunitas
beers
i
couldnt
judge
this
to
style
because
im
not
really
sure
altbier
blonde
ale
or
any
style
really
fits
this
brew
american
pale
ale
probably
fits
best
but
not
at
8
9
but
nonetheless
this
is
another
solid
offering
overall
good
and
interesting
but
nothing
spectacular
that
makes
me
want
to
buy
this
again
though
lagunitas
bombers
are
usually
a
good
price
overall
i
liked
this
once
you
get
past
the
light
smell
it
really
takes
off
wonferful
taste
one
word
to
describe
this
beer
wild
its
got
tons
of
stuff
going
on
and
its
hop
complexity
rivals
pte
its
almost
that
similar
build
and
flavor
profile
im
definitely
going
to
try
and
get
my
hands
on
more
of
this
wonderful
beer
and
try
and
discover
even
more
nuances
o
as
nice
as
i
was
to
split
this
i
almost
wish
i
was
more
greedy
and
saved
it
for
myself
i
like
this
a
lot
i
always
look
forward
to
new
lagunitas
offerings
to
get
my
hands
on
poured
into
a
becker
a
brilliant
copperbronze
with
a
fluffy
white
one
finger
head
atop
that
took
its
time
settling
fresh
malty
aromas
of
bread
ans
lightly
sweet
caramelfresh
herbal
tones
underneath
again
fresh
is
a
good
word
to
us
for
the
flavorsslightly
crisp
bread
and
caramel
tones
with
slight
nuttininessof
course
hops
are
gonna
play
a
part
from
these
guys
lending
a
gentle
herbal
finish
if
i
was
from
northeast
germany
i
might
have
a
heart
attack
over
this
beerbut
iam
not
and
i
think
its
a
great
new
world
big
alt
beer
overall
weird
nice
flavors
though
and
i
would
certainly
buy
this
again
hell
im
thinking
of
looking
for
the
extra
bottle
i
bought
right
now
this
pours
a
clear
copperish
color
with
a
nice
slightly
off
white
head
the
smell
is
a
little
sweet
i
get
some
pine
and
citrus
hops
kind
of
reminds
me
of
their
little
sumpin
the
feel
is
thicker
than
expected
its
on
the
heavier
end
of
medium
body
the
taste
is
different
than
expected
there
is
the
sweetness
lots
of
caramel
and
toffee
the
hop
bitterness
is
a
little
off
with
a
weird
after
taste
ripe
orange
peals
and
there
is
more
alcohol
flavor
and
burn
than
i
was
expecting
noticeable
booziness
this
is
okay
but
i
doubt
i
get
it
again
little
sumin
is
way
better
from
this
smooth
light
bodied
beer
easy
drinker
has
a
sneaky
8
on
it
lagunitas
just
keeps
churning
em
out
maybe
not
a
grand
slam
but
id
be
happy
to
see
this
beer
on
tap
anyday
o
pretty
good
beer
not
a
hop
bomb
not
a
malt
bomb
it
has
a
nice
balance
im
not
very
familiar
with
altbiers
but
i
think
this
was
a
good
start
other
comments
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
lagunitas
beers
all
taste
pretty
similar
something
about
the
malt
profile
hops
and
mouthfeel
that
doesnt
seem
to
vary
much
from
beer
to
beer
final
thought
why
is
everything
lagunitas
makes
that
is
seasonal
so
awesome
thank
you
again
lagunitas
for
always
making
a
top
shelf
product
8
and
only
around
4
wtf
overall
this
is
tasty
but
no
altbier
you
find
new
things
through
experimentation
like
northwestern
hops
dont
really
belong
in
altbier
as
the
usual
lagunitas
hop
bomb
this
is
good
for
the
price
just
dont
expect
it
to
taste
like
altbier
well
done
guys
d
this
is
a
big
thick
and
mostly
sweet
beer
it
seems
to
be
a
double
alt
almost
like
they
literally
took
a
normal
alt
and
since
lagunitas
cant
seem
to
do
anything
normal
just
doubled
it
the
malt
is
very
sweet
and
completely
dominates
the
beer
if
you
really
look
for
it
you
can
detect
a
fairly
significant
level
of
hop
bitterness
but
it
just
isnt
up
to
dealing
with
the
hugely
sweet
malt
in
this
beer
nonetheless
it
is
surprisingly
drinkable
for
what
it
is
surprisingly
easy
to
drink
for
the
alcohol
strength
lagunitas
continues
to
impress
me
with
their
high
quality
and
good
value
beers
o
overall
a
great
brew
reminds
me
of
a
really
good
dipa
or
a

was
a

opinion
i
pretty

gave
my
opinion
while
i
went
through
the
flavor
to
reiterate
this
is
a
good
beer
if
it
were
meant
to
be
a
balanced
dipa
or
something
dont
buy
it
expecting
to
try
anything
even
remotely
coincident
with
an

o
im
begininning
to
think
that
my
taste
buds
seek
out
hops
based
on
the
description
of
an
altbier
i
would
not
categorize
this
as
such
because
all
i
tastesmell
is
the
hops
to
me
this
tasted
like
a
double
ipa
from
a
brewery
known
for
their
hoppy
beers
just
enough
of
a
malt
character
to
give
me
reason
to
pause
not
familiar
with
the
style
but
i
wouldnt
think
this
is
a
good
example
of
it
this
si
an
interesting
beer
i
dont
like
it
as
much
as
the
hoppy
red
lucky
13
but
this
alt
is
quite
good
this
purchase
was
a
happy
accident
im
glad
i
got
to
try
this
beer
this
brew
pours
a
nice
deep
golden
color
with
two
fingers
of
head
retention
and
lacing
are
quite
good
it
smells
like
a
lagunitas
brew
to
be
completely
frank
plenty
of
dank
citrus
hops
and
alcohol
the
taste
on
this
brew
is
actually
quite
interesting
it
starts
out
with
some
aggressively
bright
and
sweet
hops
along
with
some
tropical
fruit
aspects
and
sweet
grain
sweet
is
really
the
main
thing
here
theres
really
not
much
bittering
hops
here
with
just
a
little
bit
of
bitterness
coming
through
on
the
finish
along
with
some
honey
flavors
the
mouthfeel
is
solid
it
feels
just
about
right
if
unexceptional
the
drinkability
is
good
but
hampered
by
the
sweetness
overall
an
interesting
beer
that
stands
out
from
the
lagunitas
lineup
its
another
solid
brew
i
might
be
jaded
by
the
stream
of
lagunitas
offerings
each
being
so
predictably
similar
in
character
to
the
last
except
that
i
dont
think
ill
ever
tire
of
their
brand
of
uberhoppy
fully
flavoured
ludicrously
drinkable
beer
nor
would
i
ever
want
to
stop
supporting
a
brewery
that
offers
said
ales
with
such
clever
packaging
at
such
reasonable
prices
pours
a
mostly
clear
amber
with
two
fingers
of
creamy
offwhite
head
settles
to
a
quarter
inch
with
a
few
big
clumps
of
lace
on
the
glass
from
the
center
of
my

whatever
style
you
or
i
think
this
is
its
a
really
tasty
beer
bottled
july
7th
o
this
beer
definitely
tastes
like
it
is
strongunlike
typical
altbiersalthough
for
the
most
part
the
alcohol
is
well
masked
from
the
smell
and
taste
the
smell
and
taste
are
very
unique
for
the
style
i
dont
mean
to
suggest
this
beer
doesnt
taste
good
well
anyway
i
probably
should
have
limited
this
review
to
a
single
figure
overall
another
interesting
beer
from
lag
btw
the
brewhouse
is
awesome
lagunitas
always
delivers
big
hoppy
beers
at
a
great
price
no
difference
here
beer
is
light
in
body
dare
i
say
thin
with
a
mild
yeast
presence
weak
on
the
lead
off
and
a
dry
mildly
bitter
finish
pine
hops
on
the
middle
decent
i
enjoyed
it
and
would
have
it
again
o
i
didnt
realize
this
brew
was
different
than
the
mondo
red
ale
when
i
purchased
it
this
alt
version
isnt
quite
as
tasty
it
is
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
for
my
liking
hmmm
a
strange
pushandpull
at
play
here
as
the
nose
suggested
the
maltback
is
huge
tons
of
caramels
and
breadiness
and
a
pretty
good
slug
of
hops
on
the
back
end
for
whatever
reason
im
not
entirely
digging
the
combo
its
a
more
than
adequate
beer
but
malt
and
hops
seem
like
two
entirely
separate
events
a
bit
of
a
letdown
for
my
welldeserved
high
expectations
of
lagunitas
o
an
interesting
brew
and
i
really
wish
the
hops
hadnt
fallen
off
on
this
bottle
this
really
surprises
me
as
i
always
find
lagunitas
brews
to
hold
up
really
well
handling
issuewho
knows
wont
pick
this
up
again
but
id
definitely
give
it
a
try
on
draft
to
compare
and
im
already
looking
forward
to
the
next
anniversary
beer
from
lagunitas

solid

and
better
then
i
was
expecting
d
lagunitas
certainly
doesnt
seem
to
have
much
trouble
brewing
highgravity
highlyhopped
strong
ales
of
all
different
varieties
and
this
doesnt
stray
far
from
that
successful
formula
an
interesting
mashup
of
styles
there
are
elements
of
an
ipa
a
blonde
and
a
strong
ale
here
a
bit
of
a
sipper
but
a
very
worthy
brew
o
this
is
a
classic
lagunitas
take
on
a
style
they
ramp
up
the
hops
and
make
a
terrific
beer
this
is
an
imperial
american
version
of
an
alt
good
beer
o
yet
another
great
offering
from
lagunitas
grab
this
one
if
you
get
the
chance
o
ehhh
this
is
a
good
beer
but
i
probably
wouldnt
grab
another
one
a
fairly
average
well
im
actually
not
sure
what
style
this
is
an
imperial
amberred
the
abv
is
well
hidden
and
the
balance
makes
it
pretty
drinkable
o
another
good
lagunitas
beer
nothing
extraordinary
though
they
got
the
hoppy
beers
down
pat
overall
it
is
a
pretty
solid
beer
this
reminds
me
of
all
lagunitas
beers
above
average
but
nothing
that
blows
you
out
of
the
water
solid
beer
would
definitely
drink
again
compared
to
regular
lucky
13
the
alt
version
is
smoother
and
well
blonder
piny
burst
of
tropical
fruits
tastes
like
every
other
lagunitas
beer
and
the
malts
do
their
best
to
add
a
sweet
caramelrich
background
mouthfeel
is
chewy
and
thick
with
a
low
carbonation
level
lucky
13
alt
is
more
of
the
same
from
this
sonoma
brewerya
hopforward
fruity
sweet
high
abv
beer
that
youd
have
a
hard
time
picking
out
of
their
lineup
all
in
all
a
pretty
sweet
anniversary
brew
im
glad
i
gave
it
a
go
o
quite
a
surprising
brew
this
could
become
one
of
my
new
favorites
awesome
and
definitely
worth
seeking
very
good
american
strong
ale
although
it
doesnt
seem
to
fit
into
a
traditional
altbier
profile
at
least
with
my
experience
with
the
style
particularly
enjoyed
the
aroma
flavor
is
also
quite
good
just
a
little
hot
for
my
tastes
drink
i
saw
it
and
bought
it
and
was
glad
i
did
its
a
new
style
which
seems
very
close
to
a
dipa
id
love
this
on
tap
at
some
point
although
ill
take
a
bottle
too
great
balance
throughout
this
beer
nice
flavors
another
winner
from
lagunitas
shared
a
bottle
of
this
one
this
afternoon
with
schmittymack
poured
a
nice
golden
color
with
a
good
finger
or
two
of
fluffy
white
foam
aromas
of
pine
grapefruit
and
maybe
mango
on
the
palate
this
one
was
light
to
medium
bodied
with
flavors
of
pineapple
honey
and
light
malt
with
a
linger
bitter
finish
o
hell
this
beer
kicks
ass
my
local
bottle
shop
just
picked
up
the
slack
by
providing
this
new
beer
very
happy
i
purchased
the
bottle
22oz
bottle
pours
a
semi
translucent
bright
amber
color
with
a
12
inch
of
head
lots
of
lacing
aromas
of
malts
booze
citrus
and
apricots
some
hops
and
tropical
fruits
maybe
pretty
complex
smell
that
im
having
trouble
pinpointing
exactly
what
i
am
smelling
taste
is
boozey
with
some
grapefruitcitrustropical
fruits
malty
with
a
nice
alcohol
burn
at
the
finish
this
beer
has
some
of
that
typical
hoppy
lagunitas
flavor
but
a
bit
more
subdued
than
some
of
the
other
offerings
somewhat
sweet
drinkable
even
though
it
has
a
boozey
taste
to
it
again
like
with
the
aroma
hard
to
figure
out
all
the
nuances
here
there
is
alot
going
on
with
this
beer
but
i
am
digging
it
overall
this
is
a
unique
beer
worth
having
again
this
one
is
well
worth
checking
out
especially
if
you
like
dreadnaught
as
some
but
not
all
of
the
flavor
profiles
are
similar
in
my
book
o
lagunitas
makes
some
fine
ales
and
this
was
one
of
them
picked
up
a
12
bbl
of
lucky
13
alt
as
a
replacement
for
a
lagunitas
ipa
keg
that
i
suffered
through
neither
the
shop
nor
i
realized
that
it
was
the
13
alt
so
it
came
as
something
of
a
welcome
surprise
in
terms
of
reviews
the
best
i
can
offer
is
that
this
brew
reminds
me
of
founders
centennial
ipa
and
a
little
bit
like
double
dead
guyboth
of
which
i
have
had
on
my
tap
system
i
would
attribute
this
to
the
use
of
malts
to
mask
the
9
abv
characteristic
anotehr
wellbuilt
offering
by
launitas
and
one
that
im
proud
to
have
on
tap
at
home
o
pretty
pleased
with
this
basically
like
drinking
a
big
dipa
with
a
stronger
malt
base
strong
hops
good
balance
smells
and
looks
delicious
definitely
a
winner
ill
have
to
try
to
find
the
brunette
version
to
compare
overall
this
is
an
excellent
amber
ale
i
had
the
other
lucky
13
last
year
but
i
dont
remember
it
being
this
tasty
unfortunately
i
didnt
review
that
one
dangerously
drinkable
it
reminds
me
of
a
hop
stoopidundercover
investigation
shut
down
ale
hybrid
a
citrus
hop
blast
countered
with
a
maltycaramel
brown
sugar
backbone
go
get
one
i
thought
i
was
role
playing
with
the
blonde
as
i
have
rendezvoused
with
the
brunette
before
but
alas
i
see
its
another
beer
with
an
alt
at
the
end
whew
bomber
poured
into
a
snifter
i
am
met
with
a
nice
copper
colored
ale
with
a
foamy
off
white
head
with
minimal
lacing
the
aroma
is
quite
nice
with
red
grapefruit
mango
pine
and
sweet
hops
the
taste
has
a
nice
combination
of
bitter
and
sweet
on
this
beauty
very
smooth
drink
for
being
this
high
in
alcohol
light
malt
backbone
big
bitter
aftertaste
major
mouth
salivation
going
on
if
you
are
into
that
great
mouthfeel
overall
this
beer
does
the
style
proud
awesomely
drinkable
though
the
taste
may
get
tiresome
after
one
22
oz
i
noticed
as
it
warms
the
sweetness
shines
through
a
very
well
made
beer
and
of
course
worth
the
low
price
from
the
petaluma
crew
appearance
is
a
nice
golden
amber
color
that
has
a
finger
of
offwhite
head
that
dissipates
quickly
the
nose
is
much
like
a
dipa
lots
of
fruity
nuances
like
pineapple
grapefruit
and
mango
fresh
and
inviting
the
taste
is
very
fruity
with
the
pineapple
dominating
a
stong
bitterness
creates
a
nice
dry
mouthfeel
mediumbodied
and
easy
to
drink
this
is
more
of
a
a
dipa
than
anything
else
damn
tasty
bottle
poured
a
nice
golden
amber
color
with
a
large
white
head
that
lasted
awhile
and
laced
nicely
piney
floral
hops
dominate
the
smell
taste
is
a
fantastic
balance
of
flavors
citrusy
sweet
and
apricot
flavor
malts
balance
nice
with
the
bready
malts
slick
mouthfeel
and
medium
bodied
finishes
with
a
smooth
bitterness
from
the
hops
overall
as
i
said
way
too
similar
to
maximus
in
all
honesty
all
of
the
hoppy
lagunitas
beers
are
somewhat
similar
for
me
but
this
goes
too
far
plus
maximus
is
not
my
favorite
dipa
by
any
means
ultimately
i
still
do
enjoy
it
as
i
like
the
signature
lagunitas
taste
but
i
prefer
it
be
better
balanced
within
the
beer
pour
is
good
nice
foamy
head
that
laces
the
glass
the
smell
is
so
perfect
i
have
no
idea
what
an
alt
beer
is
supposed
to
smell
or
taste
like
but
im
guessing
its
not
like
this
scent
is
the
standard
lagunitas
sweet
hop
concoction
smell
mixed
with
some
serious
passionfruit
and
some
fresh
cut
grass
the
first
sip
is
a
bit
of
a
let
down
perhaps
because
i
am
a
fan
of
lagunitas
ipas
and
this
style
is
not
usual
for
them
a
lighter
version
of
the
ipa
but
still
good
and
quite
flavorful
weaker
then
the
scent
but
unique
and
a
little
peppery
hops
are
great
and
sweet
malt
and
baked
fruit
are
there
all
and
all
solid
but
i
would
rather
have
a
shutdown
maximus
or
sumpin
sumpin
a
very
nice
hoppy
beer
that
as
it
warms
becomes
more
balanced
with
malts
inexpensive
for
a
bomber
and
prety
good
overall
this
was
a
really
pleasant
and
enjoyable
beer
at
such
a
great
price
ill
definitely
be
grabbing
more
of
these
before
theyre
gone
for
good
overall
this
beer
is
outstanding
they
def
need
to
make
this
one
again
o
an
interesting
and
solid
beer
ive
already
tried
several
of
these
over
the
last
few
days
and
would
definitely
buy
more
with
all
due
respect
i
dont
think
this
was
classified
correctly
i
have
not
had
an
alt
beer
but
just
by
reading
the
description
this
aint
one
tastes
almost
like
a
burton
baton
jr
a
cross
between
an
ipa
and
a
strong
ale
im
guessing
the
alt
influenced
the
classification
but
dont
think
thats
what
lagunitas
meant
d
a
bomber
size
is
just
about
perfect
for
this
beer
i
will
probably
pick
this
one
up
again
if
i
see
it
poured
from
a
22oz
bottle
into
my
dales
pale
ale
shaker
glass
very
hard
to
get
more
than
half
a
finger
of
head
out
of
it
very
big
bubbled
body
kinda
looks
like
a
cream
soda
decent
lacing
smells
first
off
like
lagunitas
house
yeast
flowery
hops
a
little
bit
of
citrus
but
not
too
mucho
big
malt
character
on
the
tongue
some
light
bubblegum
flavors
and
a
nice
flowery
and
citrusy
bite
nice
biting
bitter
finish
sneaky
for
8
9
id
say
not
like
any
altbier
ive
ever
had
great
addition
to
the
lagunitas
lineup
overall
this
is
ok
but
maybe
not
something
i
would
grab
again
i
love
lagunitas
and
love
witchsbrew
for
sharing

closer

with

quite
good
but
not
my
favorite
blend
best
shared
amongst
46
a
little
goes
a
long
way
o
pretty
ridiculous
brew
one
of
the
heaviest
and
sweetest
ever
huge
booziness
but
somehow
that
doesnt
even
cut
it
down
it
just
makes
it
even
more
absurd
pretty
much
every
kind
of
malty
flavor
imaginable
chocolate
vanilla
caramel
toffee
fruits
and
just
plain
ole
sugar
big
and
bold
but
the
flavors
are
fairly
well
balanced
the
sweetness
however
is
not
amazing
what
these
guys
can
create
with
a
blend
of
beers
truly
amazing
stuff
overall
oh
god
i
thought
ucaba
was
fws
pinnacle
achievement
sorry
whalez
im
a
fan
of
tuna
now
it
actually
feels
heretical
to
give
this
less
than
5
stars
how
about
them
apples
firestone
anniversaries
have
always
been
one
of
my
favorites
each
year
the
brew
is
full
of
rich
flavors
and
lovely
complexities
and
it
is
a
pleasure
to
try
and
pick
out
which
characteristics
came
from
which
of
my
favorite
seasonal
and
year
round
firestone
brews
this
year
did
not
disappoint
the
review
is
of
my
third
bottle
cellared
for
6
months
pour
is
pretty
standard
of
this
kind
of
beer
dark
and
ominous
light
wheat
colored
tinges
seen
through
light
smell
is
pretty
interesting
if
the
beer
is
still
very
cold
the
first
thing
i
notice
is
tequila
and
agave
as
it
warms
this
transforms
to
smooth
coconut
and
vanilla
followed
by
heavy
thick
chocolate
and
coffee
taste
is
nothing
short
of
exquisite
delicious
brandy
filled
chocolates
melting
in
your
mouth
lots
of
different
things
to
focus
on
and
enjoy
feel
is
full
body
smooth
and
thick
coats
every
part
of
your
mouth
overall
one
of
the
greats
cant
wait
to
try
another
one
in
a
year
or
so
drank
my
bomber
over
two
different
nights
and
enjoyed
the
second
glass
even
more
than
the
first
highly
recommended
one
of
the
top
10
beers
i
have
ever
tasted
truly
exceptional
and
unlike
any
other
beer
a
winner
had
this
on
draft
at
churchills
way
way
way
too
much
cinnamonsyrup
might
be
solid
in
several
years
after
that
mellows
yet
another
decadent
and
delicious
entry
to
the
anniversary
series
might
be
my
favorite
to
date
rich
and
complex
and
blended
to
perfection
to
quote
someone
else
on
beer
advocate
daddy
like
an
indescribable
beer
with
a
very
prominent
rating
well
worth
the
premium
price
of
2222oz
wanted
to
give
this
one
a
try
and
break
away
from
the
ipas
and
stouts
i
drink
but
not
a
fan
of
the
bourbon
aged
beers
overall
this
is
one
complex
beast
baller
status
overall
complex
as
hell
but
approachable
all
things
considered
has
a
noticeable
sourness
that
doesnt
quite
fit
with
the
overall
theme
but
an
interesting
experience
nonetheless
on
tap
at
back
bar
of
monks
for
their
charity
event
spectacular
anniversary
ale
that
wont
last
too
long
great
bourbon
flavors
overall
one
of
the
better
anniversary
ales
fw
has
put
out
worth
seeking
out
another
amazing
blend
from
fw
i
think
17
might
have
been
slightly
better
but
this
was
still
so
tasty
due
to
how
much
it
leans
on
parabola
delicious
like
parabola
awesome
aroma
fantastic
as
it
warms
very
smooth
and
velvety
not
very
hot
at
all
superb
a
great
beer
the
caramel
notes
along
with
roasty
malts
make
this
a
fantastic
super
blend
form
the
firestone
barrel
series
tbc
another
quality
anniversary
from
fw
very
tasty
better
as
it
warmed
if
memory
serves
me
correct
i
liked
this
better
than
17
tastes
mostly
just
like
parabola
wow
it
will
be
even
better
in
a
year
or
two
o
a
pretty
big
disappointment
compared
to
previous
fw
anniversary
beers
and
in
light
of
the
evergrowing
price
tag
will
probably
just
look
for
this
ontap
in
the
future
the
heavy
dose
of
parabola
really
did
this
beer
well
one
of
the
best
barrel
beers
that
firestone
has
offered
up
it
was
one
of
the
firestone
flight
i
tried
it
was
the
best
smooth
dark
beer
nothing
is
overpowering
each
other
perfect
beer
to
me
overallsuper
delicious
has
all
the
flavors
you
love
in
barley
wines
and
yet
is
very
unique
very
smoothvery
complex
just
outstanding
all
around
wow
what
a
complex
beer
to
savor
beers
like
this
are
why
i
am
into
craft
beer
smell
is
of
deep
oak
and
toffee
taste
is
multiple
layers
of
oak
bourbon
toffee
caramel
and
a
touch
of
dark
chocolate
alcohol
is
there
but
surprisingly
subtle
this
is
in
my
top
5
such
an
amazing
beer
really
happy
to
have
found
this
on
draft
o
incredibly
complex
very
boozy
very
malty
great
flavors
but
very
intense
not
an
easy
drinker
but
a
hell
of
a
beer
another
excellent
fw
brew
although
i
prefer
the
parts
to
the
whole
in
this
one
it
is
definitely
a
treat
to
be
savored
so
smooth
lots
of
parabola
bourbon
dried
dark
fruits
sugars
glad
i
have
one
more
epic
o
its
good
but
perhaps
overly
parabolay
recommended
ive
really
enjoyed
the
entire
of
anniversary
ales
save
for
the
16
m
full
bodies
thick
and
creamy
light
to
moderate
carbonation
wow
let
this
warm
up
more
than
most
beers
this
one
really
really
evolves
as
it
warms
its
almost
a
completely
different
beer
now
sweet
tobacco
oak
bourbon
vanilla
very
complex
obviously
let
this
one
warm
up
a
good
bit
dont
drink
it
fast
and
enjoy
a
truly
incredible
brew
that
has
one
of
the
greatest
taste
you
will
ever
experience
very
expensive
but
well
worth
it
drink
it
only
with
your
closest
friends
who
deserve
it
awesome
just
awesome
fw
is
at
the
top
of
the
list
for
barrel
aged
beer
should
have
bought
two
hopefully
i
can
still
find
one
cant
wait
for
19
bottle
i
have
noticed
this
anniversary
offering
from
firestone
walker
has
the
highest
percentage
of
parabola
i
can
remember
this
anniversary
brew
pours
darker
than
most
i
remember
from
fw
it
is
a
very
dark
brown
tan
thin
oily
head
as
anticipated
the
nose
is
intense
like
a
low
rolling
nimbus
cloud
of
aroma
the
barrel
influence
is
as
important
as
any
aspect
of
the
nose
vanilla
roast
coconut
wood
burnt
sugar
and
caramel
boozy
fig
plum
and
raisin
aerated
chocolate
the
flavor
slides
right
in
where
the
nose
left
off
dark
fruit
layered
in
roast
and
some
bitter
chocolate
rich
caramel
brown
sugar
candy
sugar
a
bit
of
coconut
intense
yet
regal
barrel
flavor
not
just
oak
or
bourbon
barrel
complexity
finishes
with
a
dense
decadent
feel
medium
carbonation
lots
of
body
alcohol
is
noticeable
but
works
well
with
all
the
barrel
character
i
have
come
to
expect
greatness
from
these
fw
offerings
no
surprise
they
have
done
it
again
drink
i
will
say
that
it
was
good
it
was
a
solid
beer
and
that
fw
always
does
a
good
job
it
wasnt
the
best
of
the
anny
series
i
have
had
but
thats
only
because
i
like
stouts
better
than
strong
ale
blends
wonder
how
this
one
will
age
as
i
always
say
not
as
complex
as
some
other
vintages
but
still
as
glorious
as
ever
this
is
pretty
solid
and
id
say
better
than
xvii
it
is
very
well
balanced
and
none
of
the
individual
portions
dominated
the
flavor
profile
a
downside
is
that
it
was
significantly
more
expensive
than
last
year
good
not
great
firestone

is

but
with

it
warms

with

thicker
than
i
expected

fantastic
i
prefer

a
little
too

seemed
a

really
opened
up
nicely
into
a
rich

not
heavy
beer
when
warm
bourbon
oak

toffee
notes
burnt
sugars
and
vanillas
and
hints
of
brandy
fucking
delicious
and
oddly
stings
my
tongue
love
it
o
a
nice
anniversary
offering
from
firestone
walker
not
currently
better
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
but
better
than
the
17th
anniversary
and
it
may
integrate
more
given
time
recommended
given
that
it
is
a
little
pricey
what
an
amazing
beer
very
very
very
strong
smell
of
whisky
caramel
and
chocolate
and
the
taste
is
about
the
same
at
first
a
lot
of
whiskey
follow
by
sweet
caramel
and
finishing
with
a
nice
cocoa
flavor
very
very
very
good
beer
the
best
anniversary
from
firestone
walker
that
i
have
had
yet
poured
into
a
firestone
walker
snifter
pours
a
very
dark
nearly
opaque
brown
with
a
thin
khaki
head
that
dissipates
to
patches
with
slippery
light
lacing
aroma
of
bourbon
dark
fruit
vanilla
hints
of
nuts
and
chocolate
dominated
by
the
bourbon
barrel
elements
very
appealing
flavor
is
wonderfully
integrated
dark
dried
and
fresh
fruit
vanilla
oak
wood
bourbon
caramel
pale
malt
and
a
hint
of
grassy
hops
finishes
with
bourbony
dark
caramel
malt
and
a
hint
of
molasses
medium
to
heavy
bodied
nearly
syrupy
complex
but
balanced
the
flavors
are
well
melded
the
high
abv
shows
through
even
the
dense
flavor
of
this
but
mostly
as
bourbon
and
toffee
delicious
my
choice
for
this
new
years
eve
on
the
day
i
retired
from
work
i
didnt
regret
it
from
the
moment
i
opened
the
bottle
im
completely
blown
away
firestone
has
done
it
again
the
only
problem
i
have
with
this
beer
is
i
didnt
get
more
than
1
do
yourself
a
favor
and
drink
this
now
tend
to
grab
these
out
of
a
curiosity
but
they
really
turned
this
one
up
a
notch
and
made
a
real
memorable
one
might
be
one
for
the
memory
bank
to
file
about
boy
i
remember
back
when
nearly
perfect
but
highly
memorable
serving
type
bottle
o
a
great
beer
for
sure
let
it
warm
up
for
best
results
i
was
hoping
for
more
barrel
and
more
of
parabola
to
come
through
which
i
personally
did
not
get
i
liked
this
better
than
firestone
12th
anniversary
though
oi
dont
know
how
firestone
decides
on
the
blend
for
these
beers
but
they
got
it
right
with
18
this
is
a
monster
beer
and
one
glass
will
sip
with
pleasure
for
hours
but
it
doesnt
get
cloying
or
overly
sweet
like
some
beers
in
this
category
i
wish
i
bought
another
bottle
firestone
walker
best
one
yet
this
beer
really
defies
categorization
with
the
attributes
of
multiple
styles
coming
through
i
loved
how
the
sweet
vanilla
and
caramel
aspects
of
a
barley
wine
or
old
ale
married
with
the
roasty
chocolate
and
coffee
notes
of
a
stout
certainly
a
big
beer
but
surprisingly
drinkable
and
not
overly
heavy
on
the
palate
mixing
so
many
different
flavors
could
result
in
a
bit
of
a
mess
but
fw
did
such
a
great
job
here
wish
i
had
another
one
for
the
cellar
22oz
bottle
purchased
for
around
22
dark
brown
almost
black
head
at
first
and
then
nothing
very
nice
aromas
of
bourbon
barrels
sugar
vanilla
booze
flavor
was
a
lot
of
parabola
boourbon
barrel
stout
brown
sugar
and
a
hint
of
hoppiness
which
must
be
form
the
jacks
in
there
pretty
much
what
i
would
expect
from
firestone
walker
delicious
barrel
aged
blended
strong
ale
overall
this
just
outstandingly
complex
and
perfectly
balanced
well
freaking
done
poured
from
a
22
oz
bottle
into
a
belgian
tulip
glass
when
i
was
younger
i
used
to
occasionally
combinein
a
semiarbitrary
mannerseveral
different
kinds
of
soda
from
a
fountain
in
the
restaurants
or
dining
halls
i
frequented
the
result
tended
to
be
a
rather
delicious
mixeven
at
times
a
messof
dissimilar
and
contrasting
flavors
this
beer
is
just
like
that
i
know
that
fw
in
crafting
this
beer
annually
wants
to
create
something
that
is
better
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
it
may
or
may
not
succeed
in
this
each
and
every
year
but
regardless
the
mere
sum
of
those
parts
is
exceptional
really
really
solid
the
only
knock
is
that
it
isnt
as
viscous
as
some
people
might
like
in
such
a
big
rich
beer
overall
i
had
to
try
this
when
i
heard
it
was
38
parabola
which
i
love
and
this
does
not
disappoint
mindblowing
beer
a
definite
winner
i
am
going
to
have
to
pick
up
a
few
bottles
for
the
cellar
at
least
two
a
bit
pricey
at
24
but
definitely
worth
it
amazing
beer
must
try
if
you
love
ba
stouts
like
parabola
or
just
ba
beers
in
general
lighter
body
than
a
straight
up
imperial
stout
but
still
rich
and
creamy
very
solid
amazing
effort
still
figuring
out
the
complexity
in
this
overall
this
is
another
wonderful
crafting
by
the
good
folks
and
their
friends
at
fwbc
i
have
to
say
this
is
the
brew
i
look
forward
to
the
most
every
year
and
that
is
saying
a
lot
good
beer
lighter
in
flavor
than
dba
or
parabola
some
wine
notes
to
ale
ive
had
each
anniversary
ale
since
15
and
this
one
is
the
best
in
my
opinion
pours
a
dark
dark
brown
with
a
slight
burgundy
smell
is
very
heavy
on
the
booze
and
wood
there
are
hints
of
vanilla
and
figs
there
is
also
a
slight
amount
of
earthy
hop
presence
on
the
nose
holy
shit
is
tastes
amazing
toffee
vanilla
caramel
bourbon
its
creamy
too
so
creamy
this
is
the
best
barrel
aged
beer
ive
had
no
contest
these
beers
are
always
amazing
no
one
blends
beer
outside
of
belgium
quite
like
firestone
will
be
interesting
to
see
how
this
changes
over
time
overall
a
strong
release
i
think
the
presence
of
ipa
even
in
such
a
small
amount
made
a
pleasant
balance
against
the
heavy
weights
it
was
pretty
drinkable
overall
another
good
fw
anniversary
beer
this
one
appeals
to
me
because
the
parabola
in
the
blend
asserts
itself
fairly
well
i
loved
xvii
and
am
a
big
fan
of
xviii
i
will
hang
on
to
some
of
my
bottles
to
revisit
this
in
a
year
or
so
overall
a
bitter
disappointment
im
probably
biased
im
bireligiously
jewish
but
i
like
this
beer
lchaim
not
a
bad
choice
for
the
price
which
is
much
lower
than
their
other
high
abv
offerings
just
not
impressive
enough
to
warrant
a
second
round
its
pretty
on
the
pour
that
much
is
certain
for
me
the
beer
falls
apart
from
there
theres
a
soapyness
in
the
smell
that
extends
to
the
flavor
pomegranate
flavor
is
lost
in
here
theres
an
edge
to
the
bitterness
that
kinda
reminds
me
of
biting
into
pomegranate
seeds
but
thats
about
it
mouthfeel
is
thin
the
overall
experience
is
that
of
drinking
over
brewed
over
sweetened
black
tea
with
a
shot
and
a
half
of
vodka
thrown
in
for
a
boozy
kick
i
wont
be
getting
this
again
and
i
cant
think
of
anyone
i
could
warmly
recommend
this
to
c
o
my
mother
always
says
remember
there
will
always
be
those
greater
and
lesser
than
yourself
certainly
the
case
with
this
beer
its
just
ok
props
for
brewing
outside
intuition
though
and
more
props
for
keeping
the
flavors
from
being
overwhelming
o
in
spite
of
it
being
heavy
on
the
sweetness
and
the
pomegranate
not
being
the
star
it
was
a
remarkably
drinkable
beer
which
could
be
a
dangerous
thing
given
the
8
abv
i
like
this
better
than
most
other
pomegranate
beers
out
there
but
it
still
has
that
characteristic
hebrew
malt
heaviness
even
in
a
beer
where
it
doesnt
belong
all
their
beers
seem
to
have
this
going
on
even
the
session
beer
its
just
a
weird
trademark
than
makes
some
of
the
beers
not
as
good
as
they
should
be
this
pours
shiny
copper
in
color
like
a
new
penny
boasting
a
half
inch
of
dense
white
foam
although
it
fades
out
fast
the
nose
is
sweet
and
tart
from
the
fruit
juice
and
there
is
a
hearty
grain
backing
dense
like
a
bran
muffin
the
cereals
and
fruit
work
well
in
taste
like
a
bowl
of
granola
or
something
this
beer
has
that
sort
of
filling
vibe
the
fruit
is
subtle
and
complementary
alcohol
is
more
intense
and
up
front
than
it
probably
should
be
but
it
is
just
a
reminder
of
this
brews
strength
a
good
morning
beer
and
a
good
hangover
beer
not
epic
but
better
than
the
other
hebrew
stuff
ive
had
for
the
most
part
maybe
its
just
not
my
style
but
i
found
this
one
too
malty
with
the
pomegranate
not
bringing
enough
to
the
table
overall
not
bad
not
great
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
i
would
open
up
with
some
friends
and
say
hey
lets
try
something
different
i
think
that
may
be
the
best
way
to
describe
it
different
its
not
what
i
would
expect
from
either
a
pomegranate
ale
or
an
imperial
amber
i
dont
think
that
ill
be
picking
up
this
one
again
anytime
soon
i
repeatedly
shake
my
head
after
trying
to
enjoy
this
beer
so
many
times
now
it
has
failed
me
has
it
failed
you
too
id
probably
try
this
again
unique
in
that
it
centers
on
pomegranate
maybe
i
will
try
more
bold
ambers
in
general
poured
a
good
looking
orangered
with
a
thing
white
head
that
dissipated
scents
of
ale
yeast
malt
and
slight
pomegranate
juice
the
flavor
begins
with
dark
fruits
citrus
and
some
sour
fruity
flavors
a
mild
hop
bitterness
is
also
present
and
allows
the
sweetness
to
shine
through
there
is
a
pronounced
flavor
of
alcohol
on
the
finish
it
has
a
mildly
carbonated
mouthfeel
with
some
slight
stickiness
overall
its
a
good
beer
with
a
combination
of
bitter
sweet
and
sour
flavors
it
may
not
be
everyones
thing
but
i
enjoyed
it
o
oofah
this
beer
makes
me
shake
not
a
fan
had
much
better
strong
ales
overall
this
is
an
offtasting
lager
i
wouldnt
recommend
going
out
of
your
way
for
it
not
fun
overall
well
the
plus
is
it
has
a
real
pomegranate
flavor
the
issue
i
have
is
its
not
fruity
enough
the
hops
are
bitter
mixed
with
the
sour
tart
pomegranate
gives
it
a
extra
tart
kinda
bland
flavor
still
its
enjoyable
but
nothing
to
special
nicely
priced
for
the
22ozer
but
not
the
great
summertime
beer
i
was
expecting
o
not
bad
but
certainly
a
flawed
beer
it
was
a
good
attempt
at
an
experimental
strong
ale
but
it
just
falls
short
in
a
few
areas
the
bready
malt
flavors
seem
out
of
place
and
the
lack
of
true
pomegranate
flavor
is
disappointing
o
meh
i
dont
think
i
will
look
for
it
again
its
not
as
interesting
as
i
was
hoping
for
id
like
to
try
this
again
later
to
see
if
my
thoughts
change
on
it
its
good
but
could
be
better
in
my
opinion

rereview
i
will
stand
by
my
earlier
review
of
this
taste
is
a
cross
between
a
barlewine
and
an
ipa
but
i
really
dont
like
it
much
better
than
i
did
last
year
a
shame
because
i
would
really
like
a
nice
pomagranate
ale
but
overall
not
a
bad
ale
to
just
sip
kind
of
disappointed
that
i
cant
taste
the
pom
poured
into
a
seattle
beer
week
pint
glass
pours
a
medium
coppery
orange
amber
with
a
fine
twofinger
white
head
with
great
retention
and
lots
of
lacing
aroma
of
sweet
and
biscuit
malt
and
fresh
pomegranite
juice
very
appealing
flavor
is
malt
biscuits
and
pomegranite
juice
finishing
with
well
melded
dry
grassy
hop
bitterness
malt
and
residual
sweet
juice
the
flavors
are
well
integrated
medium
bodied
with
a
nice
mouth
feel
from
carbonation
a
uniquely
flavored
ale
that
was
fun
to
drink
and
well
made
i
will
revisit
this
one
again
shmaltz
is
one
of
a
handful
of
breweries
who
are
pushing
the
envelope
for
ingredients
having
fun
with
the
presentation
and
still
producing
top
notch
ales
o
interesting
take
but
not
a
beer
that
made
me
look
forward
to
the
next
sip
overall
a
decent
beer
but
lighter
than
expected
could
of
had
a
stronger
fruit
taste
it
is
really
smooth
for
the
abv
personally
i
feel
this
recipe
needs
refinement
it
is
not
without
promise
but
it
just
doesnt
deliver
the
goods
sorry
hebrew
i
really
wanted
to
like
this
but
it
just
doesnt
work
for
me
smell
and
taste
are
very
very
reminiscent
of
a
doppelbock
to
me
which
is
odd
since
this
is
an
ale
and
doppelbocks
i
believe
are
lagers
its
got
the
same
type
of
intense
sweetness
without
quite
being
cloying
i
mean
its
a
bit
cloying
but
i
like
that
doppelbockstyle
sweetness
so
im
very
much
enjoying
it
it
is
definitely
desert
beer
though
didnt
go
very
well
with
my
dinner
i
dont
think
it
would
go
well
with
much
of
anything
really
its
a
dessert
in
itself
its
got
fruitiness
to
it
but
im
not
tasting
much
pomegranate
i
was
thinking
it
would
have
a
pomegranatelike
bitterness
and
am
pleasantly
surprised
that
it
does
not
its
also
a
lot
maltier
than
i
was
expecting
from
a
fruitflavoured
beer
this
is
a
musttry
for
fans
of
sweet
beers
pours
a
hazy
amberbrown
with
a
dense
offwhite
head
that
fades
to
a
slight
cap
leaving
a
few
spots
of
lacing
mild
aromas
of
sweet
caramel
malt
dark
honey
and
slightly
tart
pomegranate
not
much
going
on
honestly
taste
is
spoton
with
the
nose
mainly
malt
honey
and
pomegranate
i
suppose
its
not
bad
and
you
certainly
get
what
they
advertise
but
its
just
not
a
particularly
tasty
beer
mouthfeel
is
a
touch
sticky
with
a
mediumfull
body
and
lowish
carbonation
wont
be
grabbing
this
again
just
not
too
impressed
pours
a
clear
copper
hue
which
leaves
a
two

and
sporadic
lacingthe
smell

really
sweet
its

and
pomegranatethe
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
not
much
carbonation
and
has
tastes
of
pomegranates
first
up
followed
by
caramel
candybutterscotch
and
finished
with
a
earthy
herbal
bitterness
and
overall
its
above
average
but
i
couldnt
see
myself
buying
it
again
anytime
soon
cheers
o
just
an
average
beer
that
i
wish
was
more
for
it
being
a
special
ale
o
great
malt
forward
profile
couldnt
find
the
much
hyped
pomegranate
but
its
still
a
nice
brew
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
orangeamber
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
heavy
on
the
pomegranate
with
some
toffee
i
also
get
a
little
bit
of
cherry
and
some
red
grapes
the
flavor
is
more
of
the
same
with
a
ton
of
pomegranate
as
well
as
some
grapes
and
cherries
the
fruit
really
stands
out
but
the
toffee
and
some
alcohol
are
also
present
overall
the
beer
is
very
sweet
which
makes
it
hard
to
drink
too
much
of
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
while
not
a
bad
beer
it
does
not
match
the
label
the
imperial
amber
ale
part
comes
through
from
the
malt
and
hops
flavor
but
i
did
not
get
anything
too
fruity
to
think
of
pomegranate
other
reviewers
talk
about
the
fruitiness
so
i
wonder
if
the
recipe
has
been
tweaked
at
any
point
single
finger
head
on
a
murky
orangish
brown
body
aroma
is
very
fruity
with
pomegranate
obviously
dominating
strawberry
and
cherry
as
well
flavor
follows
the
nose
but
is
more
tart
otherwise
this
is
a
simple
brew
medium
body
and
moderate
to
high
carbonation
with
a
semi
dry
finish
this
isnt
a
great
beer
and
you
can
probably
pass
over
this
one
o
the
appearance
and
smell
of
this
beer
were
fantastic
the
hazy
golden
appearance
with
purplish
reddish
hues
looked
very
promising
the
smell
was
even
more
promising
not
that
much
of
an
artificial
fruit
smell
that
you
get
with
a
lot
of
fruit
beers
which
i
absolutely
hate
after
the
smell
and
appearance
of
this
beer
the
rest
went
down
hill
i
was
expecting
a
beer
that
was
full
of
flavor
and
strong
on
the
palate
however
what
i
got
was
flat
sparkling
water
with
a
little
bit
of
a
pomegranate
flavor
which
caused
my
rating
to
go
way
down
the
only
good
thing
was
that
the
abv
was
very
well
hidden
i
wouldnt
strongly
recommend
picking
up
this
beer
but
for
the
price
3
and
trying
it
only
once
i
cant
complain
i
drank
this
from
a
tulip
it
pours
a
clear
copper
amber
color
with
a
rocky
off
white
head
that
reduced
to
a
filmy
layer
the
beer
smells
of
pomegranate
with
a
hint
of
cranberry
some
caramel
herbal
hops
and
a
hint
of
molasses
the
beer
is
sweet
and
almost
syrupy
flavors
of
pomegranate
and
cherry
along
with
bready
malt
butter
and
a
slight
earthy
hop
bitterness
its
very
thick
with
low
carbonation
and
a
sticky
finish
i
think
this
was
an
above
average
beer
but
could
have
been
better
with
a
lighter
body
and
more
tartness
from
the
fruit
this
is
exactly
how
it
sounds
a
strong
ale
w
pomegranate
juice
so
its
one
done
but
one
youll
be
glad
you
tried
check
it
out
if
thats
what
youre
into
doa
this
beer
has
been
on
my
hitlist
for
a
while
its
only
recently
that
i
finally
found
a
bottle
its
not
too
much
to
look
at
it
pours
a
deep
amber
with
a
small
head
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
tangy
with
malts
dominating
and
a
little
bit
of
the
pomegranate
hiding
in
the
back
the
taste
is
good
its
got
a
nice
strong
malt
thing
going
on
with
a
bit
of
a
hoppy
presence
and
the
pomegranates
doing
their
thing
throughout
the
whole
thing
adding
a
slightly
sour
fruity
edge
to
the
whole
deal
its
not
exceptional
but
its
still
very
good
the
mouthfeel
is
good
it
feels
just
about
right
for
the
strength
of
the
beer
and
the
drinkability
is
good
overall
this
is
was
a
good
beer
that
presents
something
different
in
the
fruit
beer
field
id
give
it
a
try
but
dont
get
your
hopes
up
for
something
fantastic
somewhat
sweet
malty
aroma
has
a
decided
overtone
of
pomegranate
and
i
do
like
pomegranate
pours
a
clear
slightly
ruddy
copper
with
a
fairly
thick
and
fluffy
light
beige
head
malty
woody
aroma
has
a
firm
pomegranate
note
and
hints
of
caramel
and
horehound
smooth
texture
has
about
average
body
and
fizziness
and
leaves
a
fruity
slightly
hopbitter
finish
this
beer
pours
a
light
bodied
amberish
orange
in
color
with
a
soapy
lacing
around
the
glass
the
aromas
are
of
faded
amber
malts
with
no
fruit
at
all
the
flavors
are
very
sweet
and
malty
but
again
not
reminiscent
of
any
pomegranate
or
fruit
juice
its
weird
it
could
be
an
extract
it
drinks
pretty
light
in
body
and
doesnt
have
appealing
flavor
at
all
its
odd
and
disjointed
the
pomegranate
doesnt
show
itself
and
if
you
strained
to
believe
that
it
was
then
its
forced
this
one
is
definitely
a
beer
to
avoid
o
enjoyed
it
overall
a
very
tasty
beer
this
is
something
id
buy
a
6pack
ofif
they
made
it
in
a
6pack
and
just
sip
it
all
day
i
love
the
pomegranate
its
there
but
it
blends
in
it
doesnt
overpower
the
beer
could
have
some
tweaks
here
and
there
but
i
really
like
this
beer
o
solid
amber
characteristics
with
the
feature
ingredient
on
the
subtle
side
but
it
works
the
abv
is
a
little
noticeable
but
not
a
turnoff
an
interesting
brew
worth
a
try
bottle
from
total
beverage
westminster
poured
a
clear
reddish
amber
with
a
lastng
creamy
ivory
head
aromas
of
carmel
earthiness
and
pomegranate
mouthfeel
was
light
bodied
and
crisp
with
a
smooth
dry
finish
flavors
of
pomegranate
earthiness
and
light
carmel
with
a
smooth
dry
lingering
pomegranate
finish
in
flavor
this
is
more
like
juice
than
beer
the
flavor
in
my
opinion
was
good
but
nothing
special
i
probably
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
this
one
again
mo
great
fruit
beer
with
a
lot
of
complexity
given
the
way
you
would
have
thought
this
beer
would
taste
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
hazy
amber
color
with
a
big
foamy
head
on
top
the
lacing
on
this
is
pretty
good
the
smell
of
the
beer
had
a
little
bit
of
the
fruit
on
the
nose
but
not
too
much
the
malts
were
the
main
focal
point
on
the
nose
here
the
taste
of
the
beer
has
a
nice
sweet
malt
base
in
the
beginning
and
then
it
fades
into
the
fruity
tartness
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
was
pretty
good
semithick
feeling
body
and
a
decent
amount
of
carbonation
overall
this
beer
was
pretty
good
overall
nicely
done
unusual
twist
but
nuthin
over
the
top
overall
pretty
interesting
quite
enjoyable
rather
dig
this
this
is
different
and
unique
and
i
call
success
i
havent
seen
this
lately
but
it
showed
up
as
a
12
oz
in
the
current
sampler
pack
i
thought
this
was
an
old
bottle
at
first
as
the
flavors
seemed
murky
but
apparently
not
maybe
the
least
successful
of
the
usually
good
shmaltz
offerings
yet
another
underwhelming
brew
from
an
increasingly
overpriced
gift
pack
i
want
my
money
back
o
its
like
on
iron
chef
when
they
say
but
wheres
the
theme
ingredient
o
i
cant
say
i
really
love
this
ale
its
just
a
little
too
strong
tasting
for
only
being
8
abv
without
a
lot
of
interesting
character
to
match
i
would
like
to
taste
the
barrelaged
variety
because
that
seems
like
its
exactly
what
this
needs
to
really
round
it
out
perfectly
o
i
enjoyed
this
beer
i
was
expecting
it
to
be
worse
than
it
was
so
that
helped
price
5
99
at
whole
foods
nyc
o
the
pomegranates
did
not
shine
in
this
beer
which
is
a
shame
hopefully
someone
makes
a
chocolate
pomagranate
stout
that
would
be
delicious
like
i
already
said
it
tastes
like
medicine
to
me
happy
to
try
it
but
once
is
probably
enough
d
not
a
bad
fruit
beer
overall
i
like
pomegranate
because
it
tends
to
impart
a
hint
of
tartness
which
adds
some
depth
to
the
flavor
profile
overall
unbalanced
boozy
dry
tartness
maybe
bring
down
the
abv
a
bit
tone
it
down
a
notch
it
might
be
more
palatable
probably
wont
buy
this
again
overall
for
what
i
paid
6
99
i
am
impressed
didnt
really
want
a
tart
monster
like
blushing
monk
just
wanted
a
bit
of
fruit
flavor
and
it
covers
the
boozy
aspects
of
this
imperial
red
nicely
one
of
the
best
beers
i
ever
had
from
shmaltz
o
a
little
gimmicky
but
still
an
interesting
fruit
beer
some
sour
or
tart
notes
from
the
pomegranate
juice
would
have
transformed
this
beer
the
beer
releases
from
the
22
ounce
bottle
reddish
amber
with
a
large
creamy
head
that
slowly
fades
leaving
the
lace
a
firm
sheet
upon
the
glass
nose
is
rich
in
sweet
malt
hops
and
fruit
also
present
in
the
aroma
smells
and
tastes
like
a
cross
between
a
barley
wine
and
a
big
schotch
ale
with
the
alcohol
just
a
little
untamed
the
fruitiness
come
through
slightly
moderating
the
taste
a
nice
experiment
but
the
taste
unexpected
and
a
little
jarring
finish
is
more
fruity
than
hoppy
texture
is
mediu
carbonation
is
low
an
interesting
attempt
i
think
it
needs
a
little
tweaking
but
i
enjoyed
it
overall
this
was
not
a
bad
beer
and
as
a
pomegranate
experiment
it
works
fine
but
in
the
end
its
a
near
miss
comes
off
a
tad
gimmicky
more
like
a
rock
star
than
a
high
quality
craft
beer
overall
not
a
bad
brew
at
all
it
has
some
of
the
consistancy
and
feel
of
a
barleywine
type
of
ale
but
without
the
kick
pretty
easydrinking
and
enjoyable
interesting
brew
as
a
whole
glad
to
have
tried
it
but
cant
see
myself
revisiting
much
its
not
a
great
beer
but
its
good
enough
that
im
glad
i
tried
it
and
id
like
to
have
another
one
day
poured
a
reddish
amber
with
a
bit
of
haze
and
a
small
white
head
caramel
malts
of
an
amber
ale
in
the
nose
with
some
fruit
coming
through
mostly
malts
in
the
taste
at
first
followed
by
some
harsh
bitterness
and
a
pomegranate
sensation
that
reminded
me
of
the
fruit
you
get
in
a
witbier
lightmedium
body
a
little
thin
and
sort
of
a
bitter
aftertaste
decent
but
disappointing
drinks
alright
but
not
really
in
my
wheelhouse
pretty
drinkable
for
its
high
alcohol
content
this
is
a
nice
amber
the
pomegranate
juice
is
much
more
subtle
than
anticipated
but
this
is
a
nice
brew
nonetheless
drinkability
a
very
good
amber
ale
but
honestly
the
pomegranate
seems
like
an
afterthought
here
it
really
isnt
that
expressive
in
the
beer
and
you
really
have
to
search
for
it
nevertheless
this
is
an
enjoyable
and
thoroughly
drinkable
beer
lchaim
overall
i
do
not
mind
paying
to
try
something
that
is
new
or
gimmicky
after
all
many
beer
styles
were
gimmicks
when
they
first
started
sadly
this
beer
did
not
have
total
success
it
felt
like
the
brewers
decided
to
take
the
beer
to
somewhere
unexpected
they
wanted
to
keep
the
beer
from
being
to
sweet
because
of
fruit
or
they
wanted
to
keep
it
from
being
to
fruity
either
way
the
direction
they
went
in
was
still
sweet
though
pomegranate
is
present
in
the
aroma
it
never
is
fully
integrated
into
the
beer
to
make
matters
worse
malty
and
sticky
sweetness
takes
over
and
the
alcohol
interferes
with
the
taste
thus
the
beer
does
not
seem
balanced
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
slight
lean
toward
the
red
end
head
is
good
with
a
12
inch
white
head
which
leaves
a
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
has
a
very
heavy
fruit
aroma
with
some
citrus
hops
notes
and
some
caramel
maltiness
as
well
flavor
is
very
sweet
up
front
with
a
hot
alcohol
bit
coming
in
early
in
the
tasting
followed
by
a
very
smooth
malt
and
citrus
flavor
in
the
middle
and
end
to
round
out
the
flavor
the
beer
feels
pretty
light
for
alcohol
and
the
carbonation
is
pretty
low
as
well
overall
the
fruit
flavor
is
not
discernible
and
the
citrus
and
malt
flavors
tend
to
over
ride
the
sweetness
of
the
beer
yet
another
gimmicky
beer
for
me
pours
a
slightly
murky
dark
orange
with
a
slightly
large
cream
colored
head
scent
is
very
fruity
with
nice
amount
of
hops
as
well
taste
is
not
nearly
as
fruity
as
i
thought
it
would
be
which
is
a
good
thing
pomegranite
is
very
subtle
tastes
like
a
slightly
fruity
super
hoppy
brown
ale
finishes
with
caramel
malt
and
slight
nutty
taste
mouthfeel
is
nice
slightly
creamy
drinkability
is
fairly
high
not
bad
tasting
but
nothing
special
in
my
book
d
maybe
two
it
is
a
nice
sipper
d
the
drinkability
is
good
i
think
this
is
a
good
beer
all
together
it
is
a
lot
better
than
i
thought
it
would
be
the
fruit
is
present
but
its
not
overwhelming
it
goes
down
very
easy
and
the
toastiness
of
it
makes
it
even
better
i
recommend
trying
it
d
i
could
definitely
have
a
couple
of
more
of
these
nice
to
have
every
once
in
a
while
i
will
say
i
expected
more
flavor
out
of
this
beer
especially
with
the
heavy
fruit
scents
d
this
is
a
pretty
decent
beer
overall
it
has
a
pretty
good
taste
its
a
decent
one
to
sit
back
and
relax
with
worth
picking
up
to
try
sometime
medium
body
kind
of
like
an
ipa
with
fruit
well
balanced
interesting
a
bit
high
in
the
abv
for
long
session
but
i
like
it
another
fine
offering
from
hebrew
id
get
this
again
again
interesting
enjoyable
yes
could
we
quaff
this
down
a
bottle
for
the
two
of
us
did
just
fine
it
seemed
the
pomegranate
was
lost
and
the
balance
of
flavors
just
did
not
mesh
clean
aim
this
one
at
dessert
perhaps
with
a
fruit
compote
tart
fruit
meet
caramel
and
burning
toffee
malt
interesting
and
quite
good
light
sweetness
and
has
only
hints
of
pomegranate
as
opposed
to
a
full
on
fruit
explosion
well
done
schmaltz
mouthfeel
is
creamy
enough
with
a
nice
balance
of

sweetness
one
of
the
better
hebrew
beers
i
have
tried
so
far
pours
a
promising
dark
amber
color
with
a
decent
bit

pomegranate
dark

with

some
of

not
a
big
fan
of
fruit
beers
but
ill
try
not
to
be
too
judgemental
on
this
beer
the
color
is
a
dark
hazy
brown
smell
of
pomegranate
kills
the
nose
but
i
could
swear
i
smelled
some
sort
of
chocolate
in
there
as
well
not
a
very
drinkable
beer
the
flavor
is
fruity
with
raspberry
and
a
boat
load
of
pomegranate
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
who
likes
fruity
beers
d
i
would
neither
recommend
nor
drink
again
in
the
future
i
was
eagerly
awaiting
a
chance
to
try
this
and
was
severely
let
down
the
appearance
and
aroma
start
out
innocently
enough
but
this
one
quickly
drops
off
from
there
a
little
bit
of
a
struggle
to
finish
hebrew
makes
many
excellent
beers
this
one
just
isnt
for
me
drinkability
this
is
a
very
good
beer
and
is
deceptively
drinkable
for
its
style
the
pomegranate
in
this
is
mixed
in
very
well
and
doesnt
overwhelm
other
attributes
of
the
beer
as
happens
all
too
often
with
flavored
beers
give
this
one
a
try
a
readily
agreeable
strong
ale
one
with
a
particularly
strange
fruit
adjunct
which
eventually
helps
it
all
go
down
well
enough
if
only
due
to
its
obfuscating
effect
tasty
even
if
the
contribution
of
the
pomegranate
is
more
ethereal
than
actual
familiar
and
comforting
and
if
there
are
any
old
and
by
old
im
referring
the
sort
of
oldness
that
is
alluded
to
on
each
and
every
hebrew
bottle
label
connotations
involving
the
pips
of
the
pomegranate
im
leaving
that
to
another
day
to
investigate
d
luckily
im
thirsty
so
this
will
work
for
me
right
now
but
i
seriously
doubt
ill
ever
pick
it
up
again
d
this
was
a
good
beer
to
try
since
i
do
like
both
beer
and
pomegranates
but
i
wouldnt
get
this
one
again
i
am
glad
i
was
able
to
try
it
though
d
would
tire
after
awhile
nice
enough
offering
just
not
much
there
to
applaud
or
boo
come
on
folks
i
believe
the
ratings
are
fairly
harsh
based
on
the
brew
if
you
dont
like
pomegranate
you
probably
wont
like
this
brew
this
is
quality
stuff
pomegranates
are
not
my
favorite
and
strong
ales
are
definitely
not
my
preference
but
this
is
a
great
combination
of
a
wellbalanced
fruit
beer
i
am
really
impressed
with
shmaltz
since
my
first
messiah
bold
experience
lenny
ripa
is
awesome
and
this
origin
is
great
notes
its
not
that
their
brews
are
particularly
remarkable
other
than
from
the
identity
and
marketing
standing
point
but
this
is
surely
the
poorest
offering
i
have
tried
form
this
brewery
and
well
below
a
passable
standard
being
not
only
a
bit
ugly
but
so
unfortunately
uninspiring
the
8
abv
is
not
that
noticeable
so
it
is
easy
to
drink
but
i
dont
know
that
i
would
want
to
share
more
than
1
bottle
at
a
time
not
bad
better
than
some
others
such
as
the
saranac
pomegranate
wheat
but
still
more
of
a
gimmick
than
an
enduring
trend
i
would
say
it
is
worth
the
dollar
i
spent
if
not
more
a
fine
effort
certainly
worth
a
go
but
probably
not
for
everyone
especially
people
searching
for
a
more
hoppy
strong
ale
pours
amber
with
an
obvious
tone
of
redpurple
from
the
pomegranate
aroma
is
sweet
and
sugary
some
sourness
and
pomegranate
flavor
is
tart
from
the
fruit
and
has
a
grapefruity
bitterness
but
also
sweet
with
caramel
tones
palate
is
nicely
carbonated
with
medium
body
not
bad
though
not
exceptional
d
ive
been
waiting
for
this
beer
to
open
up
a
little
as
ive
worked
through
the
bomber
but
it
hasnt
really
this
is
a
fine
beer
but
it
seems
lightly
flavored
for
a
strong
ale
and
not
nearly
as
fruity
as
i
was
expecting
im
mildly
disappointed
but
this
is
still
an
interesting
beer
its
not
like
there
are
dozens
of
imperial
pomegranate
amber
ales
an
interesting
ale
but
the
pomegranate
could
perhaps
be
a
bit
more
apparent
opponents
of
fruit
beers
may
disagree
though
and
so
perhaps
the
maltforward
balance
is
a
bit
more
appropriate
for
the
masses
still
from
an
ale
in
which
pomegranate
is
so
key
a
player
id
like
to
see
a
bit
more
of
the
fruits
character
mouthfeel
sugar
stays
big
in
the
profile
not
very
drinkable
as
it
makes
you
treat
it
as
more
of
a
desert
beer
than
desired
thanks
hebrew
for
the
wonderful
selection
keep
up
the
wonderful
job
looking
foward
to
the
14th
as
well
drinkabilityfinal
thoughts
this
beer
was
surprisingly
drinkable
i
expected
it
to
be
to
fruity
overpowered
with
pomegranate
but
i
was
wrong
i
loved
the
balancing
malty
flavors
with
the
nice
touch
of
hop
bitterness
towards
the
finish
i
could
easily
drink
23
pints
of
this
before
i
got
tired
of
it
i
enjoyed
this
one
i
think
its
worth
a
try
cheers
to
all
d
ok
i
lied
im
not
going
to
finish
a
glass
i
thought
this
beer
was
going
to
taste
more
like
this
brewerys
1010
which
i
very
much
enjoyed
the
interplay
of
bitter
tangy
and
alcoholic
here
isnt
doing
it
for
me
with
very
little
malt
taste
to
help
smooth
things
out
probably
my
least
favorite
beer
from
this
brewery
pours
a
cloudy
brown
with
a
dark
golden
color
along
the
bottom
23
inch
head
of
an
offwhite
color
great
retention
and
great
lacing
smells
of
citrus
yeast
sweet
malt
slight
hop
toffee
and
slight
alcohol
fits
the
style
of
an
american
strong
ale
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
creamy
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
yeast
citrus
slight
hops
sweet
malt
and
slight
alcohol
overall
a
good
tartness
level
nice
blend
and
good
body
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
but
they
might
get
too
sweet
over
time
i
noticed
that
as
my
pint
wore
on
the
sweetness
was
rapidly
developing
i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
will
have
another
its
above
average
and
far
better
than
i
expected
for
a
fruit
beer
this
is
a
quite
tasty
beer
im
quite
enjoying
it
certainly
not
knocking
my
socks
off
but
id
have
another
it
goes
quite
well
with
fatty
rich
grilled
meats
because
not
only
do
the
hops
cut
through
the
unique
flavor
of
the
pomegranate
adds
a
bit
of
sweetness
but
remains
sharp
and
its
a
great
compliment
to
a
slightly
chargrilled
ribeye
steak
d
not
to
sound
like
a
broken
record
with
these
guys
but
im
onedone
too
syrupy
sweet
like
many
of
their
beers
so
youre
getting
a
very
plummy
raisiny
fruity
beer
here
pomegranatey
full
of
overripe
dark
fruits
and
their
accompanying
sweetness
ultimately
origin
is
very
enjoyable
if
taken
slowly
but
perhaps
a
bomber
is
a
tad
too
big
for
this
kind
of
thing
nice
beer
that
hides
its
abv
i
wouldnt
put
it
in
my
top
ten
but
its
pretty
tasty
blipped

matisyahu
pours
a
bright
reddish
amber
with
a
little
lacing
on
top
i
think
i
picked
out
a
pomegranate
aroma
on
the
nose
but
that
might
just
be
because
this
beer
is
called
a
pomegranate
ale
and
i
really
wanted
to
pick
the
smell
out
because
it
wasnt
all
that
strong
taste
is
a
bit
fruity
tangy
hoppy
and
malty
overall
pretty
standard
nothing
stuck
out
to
me
too
much
the
taste
is
very
similar
to
the
smell
it
has
a
brandylike
richness
and
alcohol
burn
on
the
tongue
the
aftertaste
is
more
of
the
same
i
can
detect
light
hop
i
cannot
detect
any
pomegranate
oily
palate
basically
a
near
barley
wine
conclusion
i
had
no
idea
what
to
expect
this
is
definitely
above
average
for
an
americanstyle
fruit
ale
even
if
its
not
a
home
run
happy
drinking
poured
from
a
22
ounce
bomber
bottle
into
my
nonic
pint
glass
appears
a
hazy
deep
copper
color
with
about
two
fingers
of
off
white
foam
aromas
and
flavors
are
of
tart
pomegranates
berries
toasted
grains
a
hint
of
citrus
sweet

to
cut
the
tartness
a
bit
thin

taste
is
a
little
tart

earth
and

ends
just
a
little

very
good
drinkability
a
good
full
beer
flavor
with
a
perceptible
raspberry
flavor
that
doesnt
feel
like
juice
dumped
into
a
beer
interesting
kicks
of
flavor
from
hops
and
raspberry
make
this
an
interesting
beer
looking
forward
to
having
more
my
girlfriend
liked
this
brew
too
d
this
wasnt
the
best
from
hebrew
the
odd
bitterness
and
odd
finish
just
didnt
work
d
decent
and
worth
the
price
tag
but
not
something
that
id
probably
buy
again
overall
a
rather
rich
beer
that
is
in
keeping
with
a
strong
ale
not
too
heavy
but
not
really
sessionable
either
very
good
at
simply
being
what
it
is
thick
strawberry
puree
head
is
gone
and
lacing
is
light
hardly
an
aroma
a
light
scent
of
troegs
mad
elf
thick
oily
body
where
fruits
orgy
into
a
sweet
slightly
copper
metallic
mess
no
crisp
olive
oil
pomegranate
disappointment
sweet
and
ugly
this
brew
sports
a
orangetan
hue
with
fleeting
white
head
after
a
search
for
aroma
there
is
a
mild
sour
pomegranate
scent
the
taste
is
very
oily
syruplike
raspberry
strawberry
pomegranate
fruit
mix
no
carbonation
to
speak
of
which
leaves
the
heavy
bodied
brew
to
sit
slather
on
the
tongue
for
a
while
too
sweet
initially
and
then
too
sour
and
all
together
too
artificial
syrup
not
worth
trying
lets
all
save
some
money
during
this
economic
crisis
d
very
drinkable
rather
drinkable
but
this
beer
is
somewhat
forgettable
more
like
a
blevel
amber
then
perhaps
a
decent
fruit
beer
not
so
sure
how
this
is
considered
a
strong
ale
a
decent
beer
reddish
amber
pour
with
a
short
head
nice
sweet
malty
aroma
with
some
nuts
syrupy
malt
and
sugar
in
the
taste
the
pomegranates
stay
very
subdued
and
dont
overpower
the
nice
malt
backbone
interesting
that
this
falls
into
an
american
strong
over
a
fruit
beer
d
this
is
some
really
good
stuff
i
opened
this
for
dinner
with
my
wife
and
i
expected
it
to
be
one
of
her
fruity
tooty
girly
beers
but
this
is
fruit
beer
done
right
this
is
a
nice
boozy
amber
ale
with
a
healthy
dose
of
hops
and
kissed
with
a
gentle
hint
of
pomegranate
good
fruit
brew
but
a
little
bit
too
sweet
for
sessioning
like
i
said
at
the
beginning
though
the
mouthfeel
and
drinkablity
are
a
bit
off
theres
an
odd
sour
tartness
that
doesnt
do
me
well
it
has
dark
red
colored
body
it
has
a
thick
tan
head
and
not
much
lace
it
smells
of
pomegranates
it
has
a
little
bit
of
a
pale
ale
like
taste
it
is
bitter
fruity
and
has
a
strong
hop
bitter
aftertaste
it
has
almost
a
belgian
triple
like
after
taste
it
has
a
full
body
with
not
a
whole
lot
of
carbonation
i
liked
this
beer
a
lot
this
poured
a
clear
dark
gold
with
some
light
tan
head
it
smelled
like
faint
honey
and
caramel
malt
with
a
bit
of
copper
hops
it
tasted
like
rich
honey
and
caramel
malt
with
copper
and
floral
hops
and
pomegranate
it
was
fairly
thick
with
a
bit
of
carbonation
and
had
a
bitter
pomegranate
aftertaste
overall
this
was
a
very
interesting
beer
with
a
very
weak
scent
and
a
more
subtle
flavor
than
expected
but
it
tasted
nice
and
was
clean
and
easy
to
drink
the
pomegranate
was
a
nice
touch
and
it
hid
the
alcohol
well
this
is
definitely
a
beer
i
could
enjoy
again
picked
up
at
liquor
emporium
in
lompc
ca
poured
a
light
copper
color
with
an
off
white
head
from
a
brown
twenty
two
ounce
bottle
the
aroma
is
malty
and
fruity
the
nose
is
skunky
if
you
ask
me
the
flavor
is
mostly
malty
there
is
a
bit
of
fruit
but
i
cant
particularly
distinguish
it
as
pomegranate
fairly
bitter
in
the
finish
the
bitterness
seems
to
linger
too
no
hop
flavors
stand
out
this
one
is
all
about
the
malt
not
bad
but
not
anything
id
go
out
of
the
way
for
either
d
not
to
impressed
or
enjoyable
d
this
is
pretty
drinkable
for
the
alcohol
i
could
probably
drink
a
few
more
of
these
but
i
wouldnt
reach
for
it
every
time
pretty
good
beer
all
around
though
its
not
bad
very
drinkable
but
unfortunately
not
very
exciting
still
id
pick
it
up
again
and
its
definitely
worth
a
try
d
fairly
drinkable
i
had
a
22
ouncer
and
definitely
wouldnt
have
minded
a
little
more
not
sure
if
i
was
expecting
a
lambic
here
but
given
the
bottle
label
description
as
a
flavored
amber
ale
it
certainly
fit
the
bill
as
a
good
bet
dalthough
it
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
was
a
little
disappointed
in
the
overall
quality
of
this
beer
overall
ill
definitely
give
this
brewer
another
chance
but
not
this
product
d
i
enjoyed
what
i
had
d
this
is
definitely
a
different
spin
on
the
imperial
amber
ale
im
not
sure
how
well
the
pomegranate
fits
in
with
this
style
and
the
residual
bitterness
was
a
little
to
high
for
mebut
all
in
all
a
decent
drinkable
beer
i
have
an
imperial
cherry
amber
in
my
stash
to
try
soon
and
well
see
how
that
compares
to
this
one
great
opportunity
to
try
something
from
the
shmaltzhebrew
lineup
overall
pretty
good
beer
but
i
was
definitely
expecting
more
from
shmaltz
on
this
one
pours
a
clean
amber
copper
color
with
a
light
tan
head
in
the
aroma
sweet
fruit
pomegranate
and
a
nice
maltiness
in
the
taste
big
pomegranate
flavor
almost
tart
and
a
small
malt
a
smooth
and
light
to
medium
mouthfeel
with
a
small
dry
to
almost
tart
pomegranate
aftertaste
nice
big
fruit
somewhat
tart
and
hides
the
alcohol
really
dig
it
at
eight
percent
alcohol
the
fruit
masks
the
flavor
exceedingly
well
now
to
the
rest
of
the
review
the
color
is
in
line
with
what
you
would
expect
similar
to
saranac
pomegranate
wheat
nothing
really
spectacular
nothing
noteworthy
in
the
nose
but
in
my
experience
pomegranate
is
a
fairly
subtle
fruit
an
ex
really
liked
pom
i
really
liked
the
taste
it
certainly
helped
the
drinkability
the
mouthfeel
was
off
i
would
like
to
have
it
on
tap
overall
a
good
beer
i
failed
to
pick
out
the
pomegranate
but
i
dont
really
know
what
to
look
for
this
is
a
pretty
interesting
beer
because
from
the
nose
and
intial
taste
it
seems
belgian
there
is
lots
of
hops
around
but
the
style
seems
like
a
belgian
strong
ale
the
pom
is
in
the
background
and
doesnt
interfer
with
the
nice
balance
of
the
beer
there
is
a
real
malt
balance
to
make
this
very
drinkable
first
beer
i
have
had
from
these
guys
and
i
look
forward
to
trying
more
ours
a
vey
rosey
copper
amber
with
very
little
head
and
no
bubbling
looks
a
little
winey
the
aroma
has
a
pomegranate
fruitines
with
some
alcohol
heat
with
a
light
splash
of
earthiness
get
lots
of
fruity
flavors
overall
taste
piecesof
apples
pomegranates
figs
and
maybe
some
rose
hips
thehops
mix
more
with
the
alcohol
than
the
toasted
malt
flavors
veyr
warm
and
fruity
feeling
beer
if
that
makes
sense
syrupy
and
sweet
feeling
with
lots
of
warmth
maybe
too
much
mellow
fruity
and
flavorful
i
have
yet
to
enjoy
any
beer
from
hebrew
that
fails
to
impress
via
the
flavor
profile
and
inform
via
the
trippy
labels
this
particular
offering
is
at
its
core
a
nice
and
toasty
pale
ale
but
is
amped
up
into
something
wonderful
and
marvelously
drinkable
by
adding
the
shmaltzstyle
twist
of
the
unexpectedly
delicious
m
d
rather
smooth
semicreamy
mouthfeel
one
of
the
better
aspects
to
this
flavour
is
the
weakness
and
not
something
i
think
id
get
again
somewhat
of
a
juicy
flavor
with
the
bitterness
of
the
hops
kicking
in
the
alcohol
adds
a
little
spice
as
the
beer
warms
full
bodied
with
good
carbonation
the
pomegranate
lasts
for
a
while
after
each
sip
another
good
one
from
hebrew
its
an
interesting
beer
that
integrates
the
pomegranate
flavor
well
without
it
becoming
overwhelming
its
a
bit
of
a
novelty
yes
and
certainly
not
an
everyday
drinker
but
its
still
tasty
i
suggest
giving
it
a
try
especially
if
you
like
pomegranates
recommended
dont
slam
it
on
an
empty
stomach
it
really
sneaks
up
on
you
had
this
on
tap
at
rec
billiards
in
wscame
from
the
tap
in
a
standard
pint
glass
a
hazed
mix
of
ruby
read
and
brown
with
a
thinner
slight
off
white
head
pomegranate
naturally
is
the
most
prevelant
aroma
along
with
sweet
malt
and
a
faint
leafy
hop
presence
flavors
are
a
bit
of
sweet
and
sour
from
the
pomegranate
with
the
sour
winningits
defiently
malt
tilted
with
some
sweet
dough
with
a
very
light
detectable
shot
of
herb
in
the
finish
not
bad
it
goes
down
very
easy
but
its
not
overly
complexglad
i
at
least
tried
it
d
very
interesting
brew
unlike
any
ive
had
before
i
must
say
the
important
thing
to
remember
here
is
that
its
a
beer
first
then
a
fruit
beer
second
that
being
said
id
say
its
a
great
strong
ale
and
one
worth
trying
d
despite
this
beers
uniqueness
i
dont
think
that
it
scores
very
highly
for
drinkability
in
my
opinion
it
is
too
overwhelmingly
fruity
to
be
a
good
beer
to
have
a
few
of
in
a
night
the
beer
has
a
nicely
deep
reddish
copper
well
carbonated
look
about
it
you
can
see
the
effervesence
quite
nicely
and
the
head
is
a
pretty
substantial
foamy
white
lots
of
lacing
and
retention
as
well
the
smell
wasnt
particular
or
profound
in
any
one
direction
sweet
malts
some
fruity
notes
perhaps
a
bit
of
a
liquor
smell
as
well
this
is
a
pretty
full
bodied
beer
with
a
sticky
syrupy
consistency
with
a
spicey
and
acerbic
mouthfeel
there
is
a
throaty
burn
to
this
beer
in
the
finish
beyond
the
warming
alcohol
notes
the
taste
may
be
pomegranate
but
you
wouldnt
know
it
there
are
bold
sweet
malts
there
are
some
acerbic
fruity
tastes
that
are
too
vague
to
pin
down
to
anyone
one
fruit
some
stronger
liquor
flavors
some
deep
caramel
too
pomegranate
was
just
not
in
the
equation
as
far
as
i
can
detect
except
in
the
coloring
of
the
beer
that
did
have
a
nice
reddishpomegranate
tint
to
it
i
see
this
one
as
more
of
a
novelty
beer
to
be
drunk
during
passover
but
nothing
i
would
seek
out
on
its
own
d
i
could
have
2
or
3
of
these
with
no
problem
the
pomeganate
is
not
as
pronounced
as
i
thought
it
would
be
a
good
beer
but
not
as
fruity
as
i
thought
it
would
be
i
was
expecting
something
like
the
way
aprihop
has
their
fruit
come
through
if
you
are
buying
for
the
fruit
pass
it
up
but
it
is
a
good
beer
like
i
said
one
bomber
was
good
enough
for
one
sitting
its
not
really
a
great
session
beer
and
i
feel
that
another
brewer
may
have
perfected
pomegranate
ale
a
little
better
than
hebrew
maybe
an
interesting
idea
but
it
doesnt
translate
into
a
good
beer
drinkability
all
in
all
i
think
that
anyone
could
enjoy
this
beer
its
not
very
bitter
though
its
quite
watery
d
a
great
spicy
alcohol
and
toasted
caramel
sweetness
makes
for
a
very
smooth
well
rounded
flavor
and
intriguing
drink
really
nice
enjoyable
and
highly
recommended
drinkability
decent
for
a
beer
vaguely
reminiscient
of
that
sauce
you
get
with
sweetnsour
chicken
nope
this
is
fizzy
alcoholic
pomegranate
juice
with
nothing
to
resemble
beer
to
my
palate
i
wouldnt
hold
not
tasting
like
beer
against
a
legitimate
ale
beverage
which
im
sure
this
is
except
that
i
like
beer
and
i
dont
like
this
other
flavors
grapefruit
pith
theres
a
slightly
fruity
sweetness
to
it
but
nothing
that
would
remind
me
of
an
amber
ale
sorry
i
would
choose
not
to
finish
the
bottle
ill
stick
to
lennys
rye
ipa
d
i
had
expectations
of
the
fruit
being
much
more
dominant
than
it
was
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
maybe
it
was
just
a
bad
bottle
d
very
easy
drinking
did
not
think
i
would
like
this
beer
as
much
as
i
did
no
hint
of
the
abv
at
all
probably
could
have
taken
on
the
bomber
by
myself
i
was
leery
of
trying
this
beer
because
fruit
beers
tend
to
be
overwhelmingly
sweet
to
me
however
i
was
surprised
by
the
mild
taste
of
this
beer
the
scent
and
appearance
of
this
beer
are
fairly
forgettable
but
the
flavor
is
quite
nice
the
taste
focuses
more
on
the
bread
and
toasted
malt
character
with
a
slight
hoppiness
to
it
the
pomegranate
note
is
barely
discernible
overall
a
pleasant
beer
but
not
particularly
mind
blowing
darkish
amber
with
a
white
head
that
falls
pretty
quickly
and
leaves
minimal
lace
nice
nose
and
taste
pommegranate
apple
hop
and
a
little
sweet
malt
with
a
hint
of
pepper
in
the
finish
medium
body
and
very
drinkable
this
one
pleased
me
and
the
lady
friend
another
good
brew
from
my
hebrew
brufas
pretty
drinkable
an
above
average
beer
but
not
something
i
would
say
is
terribly
special
poured
into
a
snifter
origin
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
reddish
hue
that
has
great
clarity
supple
white
head
on
top
with
light
lacing
the
aromas
are
fruity
and
juicy
from
the
pomegranate
some
biscuit
and
yeast
origin
is
hoppier
than
expected
but
not
very
hoppy
at
all
bitter
fruits
with
a
hint
of
sweetness
take
over
the
flavor
mouthfeel
is
dry
mild
carbonation
smooth
and
it
has
a
complex
palate
wouldnt
mind
getting
a
few
more
of
these
as
they
are
rather
tasty
to
be
a
noveltytype
brew
company
these
guys
know
what
they
are
doing
with
beer
i
figured
that
a
fruit
beer
would
show
their
certain
flaws
however
none
are
found
here
a
very
malty
malt
base
provides
round
and
balanced
aromas
of
toasted
malts
attenuated
caramels
and
toffees
and
providing
a
bocklike
melanoiden
mouthwatering
effect
fruity
esters
give
a
lot
of
decoration
to
the
malts
and
round
out
the
light
citrus
hop
character
an
underlying
tart
berry
sweetness
also
give
a
lot
of
variety
to
the
beer
may
be
the
pommegranite
flavors
a
heaviness
to
the
malts
remind
me
of
avery
kaiser
but
with
a
stronger
toasted
malt
presences
assertive
fruitiness
and
american
hops
albeit
moderate
finishes
well
attenuated
despite
the
sweetness
a
light
berry
tartness
lingers
beyond
the
crispness

it
fits

mold
this
beer
suprised
me
i
thought
at
first
the
fruit
would
take
over
the
mix
like
a
lot
of
fruit
beers
out
there
wrong
this
one
drinks
like
a
imperial
amber
ale
with
a
whisper
of
pomegranate
fruit
the
bulk
of
the
flavor
is
the
roasted
malts
and
toasty
bread
quality
with
a
nice
hop
spice
peaking
thru
the
mix
this
is
a
must
try
from
this
company
i
was
a
little
worried
about
this
beer
i
generally
am
not
a
fan
of
fruit
beers
but
overall
i
was
pleased
with
what
i
was
drinking
good
but
not
great
md
medium
bodied
carbonation
is
about
medium
alcohol
hid
well
drinkability
is
ok
a
solid
beer
but
i
expected
a

character
from
it
thanks
for
sharing
radek
light
orange
colour
with
a
white
head
malty
and
hoppy
with
a
creamy
though
far
from
full
and
sour
juicy
finish
the
taste
is
significant
orangey
and
metallic
lagery
an
odd
sourness
a
bit
of
hop
something
different
for
fruit
fans
notes
pretty
bad
stuff
thankfully
this
was
my
friends
buy
pours
a
very
rich
amber
honey
color
smells
very
hoppy
and
almost
just
like
an
ipa
doesnt
smell
of
pomegranate
at
all
taste
is
ipa
like
and
mildly
bittered
but
smooth
the
aftertaste
is
hoppy
bitterness
i
can
tell
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
not
what
i
expected
from
the
name
and
was
a
bit
disappointed
from
that
notes
love
the
brewery
dislike
this
run
this
beer
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
an
offwhitelight
tan
colored
head
the
aroma
is
of
strong
malts
a
little
bit
of
hop
bitterness
alcohol
and
some
pomegranate
the
taste
is
not
as
pomegranatey
as
i
would
have
expected
but
it
is
a
nice
strong
ale
flavor
the
tart
pommegranate
is
a
nice
complement
to
the
strong
ale
malts
and
the
amount
of
alcohol
i
was
expecting
a
more
tart
taste
but
i
suppose
that
would
be
too
overpowering
the
mouthfeel
is
good
with
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
and
it
is
a
fairl
drinkable
beer
worth
a
shot
because
of
the
interesting
combination
d
pretty
drinkable
the
mouthfeel
is
great
but
i
was
hoping
for
more
of
the
fruit
to
pervade
the
taste
without
out
it
tasted
a
little
bland
but
the
undertones
of
pomegranate
were
there
just
not
strong
enough
while
at
the
blind
tiger
i
overheard
some
girlwoman
exclaim
i
had
the
origins
and
it
doesnt
taste
like
pomegranate
at
all
woman
what
the
hell
are
you
talking
about
drinkability
i
tried
this
on
the
recommendation
of
someone
at
a
local
beerwine
store
and
am
very
impressed
this
is
my
first
hebrew
brew
and
it
is
a
great
balance
of
fruity
and
bitter
imbibed
this
out
of
a
22
0z
bomber
into
a
widemouthed
wine
glass
the
aroma
was
a
wonderful
fruit
the
most
pleasant
of
the
pomegranate
i
have
experienced
the
taste
is
yummy
you
detect
fruit
and
warmth
and
yeast
reminiscent
of
the
fine
belgians
the
finish
is
very
dry
and
pleasant
a
great
anytime
fruit
ale
the
only
problem
with
this
ale
is
its
category
american
strong
ale
it
is
not
i
think
that
is
what
is
throwing
off
other
reviewers
this
beer
deserves
its
props
regardless
of
style
mislabeling
try
it
and
youll
see
drinkability
really
quite
flavorful
kudos
for
trying
something
different
that
actually
works
poured
for
4th
day
of
chanukah
i
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
tasting
glass
it
is
beautiful
and
bright
orangeamber
color
the
nose
is
fig
newtons
hops
some
malt
in
the
background
i
thought
the
nose
would
have
more
fruity
characteristics
based
on
the
pomegranate
but
i
didnt
notice
them
i
really
like
the
taste
of
this
beer
initially
you
get
the
pomegranate
juiciness
followed
by
a
super
dry
hoppy
finish
i
believe
it
works
very
well
the
mouthfeel
is
juicy
the
best
way
to
describe
it
it
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
although
the
alcohol
content
is
deceiving
the
drinkability
is
held
back
by
the
taste
alone
some
how
the
pomegranate
just
does
not
work
real
well
for
my
prosit
mk
d
i
was
surprised
as
i
expected
the
pomegranate
to
really
dominate
the
flavor
this
has
some
doppelbock
qualities
for
me
with
the
mix
between
sweetness
and
roastyness
i
think
this
is
a
pretty
good
brew
because
they
didnt
overemphasize
the
pomegranate
it
all
looked
so
good
upon
pouring
but
this
was
a
disappointment
d
decent
but
sweetness
at
the
end
is
cloying
bummer
aroma
is
slightly
funky
yeast
grain
and
later
earthy
hops
come
into
play
didnt
pick
up
on
any
juicyfruity
pomegranate
which
i
could
identify
had
it
been
present
flavors
were
primarily
malty
with
earthyspicy
hops
lingering
underneath
into
the
finish
odd
earthy
rootherb
reminds
me
of
pomegranate
juice
so
its
in
there
somewhere
not
as
tartsour
as
i
would
anticipate
either
huge
malty
backbone
kind
of
discordant
flavors
make
this
a
chore
to
finish
pass
d
this
beer
has
a
nice
dry
pomegranate
bite
that
replaces
the
hops
and
does
a
nice
job
of
balancing
the
sweet
malt
flavors
there
is
a
good
complexity
and
play
between
the
fruit
and
the
hops
overall
a
decent
beer
but
pretty
subdued
and
bland
this
seems
very
similar
to
the
genesis
1010
especially
after
reviewing
my
notes
for
that
dont
drink
and
review
pour
is
a
slightly
hazy
reddish
orange
with
a
behemothic
creamy
off
white
head
that
slowly
settles
leaving
the
lace
to
provide
a
thick
blanket
to
cover
the
glass
nose
is
nicely
malted
hops
provide
a
dandelion
like
aroma
with
the
pomegranate
providing
the
fruit
tones
delightful
this
nose
start
is
rich
in
malt
sweet
with
the
fruit
and
the
hops
providing
a
bit
of
twang
at
the
back
top
is
moderate
to
almost
full
the
finish
is
strict
in
its
acidity
the
hops
perfection
in
their
spicy
bite
sweet
fruit
continues
to
the
dry
sticky
aftertaste
and
the
alcohol
providing
a
nice
warm
sensation
to
the
abdominal
region
excellent
drinking
brew
but
i
expected
nothing
less
from
the
bay
area
boys
a
light
tan
head
shows
signs
of
good
carbonation
as
it
builds
a
2
finger
head
that
leaves
a
little
lace
body
is
a
meeting
of
ruby
red
and
amber
which
is
attractive
by
my
standards
nose
is
a
kickup
of
sour
dark
fruit
notes
with
slight
hints
of
mineral
spice
the
taste
is
a
bit
shocking
but
very
welcome
i
was
expecting
sour
and
i
got
bold
well
balanced
rich
and
bitter
mix
there
is
a
noticeable
hint
of
the
ponegranate
juice
on
the
back
end
of
the
palate
a
slight
soured
feel
does
exist
but
is
only
a
balancer
on
the
front
of
the
mouthfeel
this
beer
is
actually
very
interesting
and
well
balanced
with
lots
of
dark
wheat
and
mineral
qualities
good
stuff
i
wanted
this
to
be
a
great
fruit
beer
but
it
was
just
a
decent
fruited
strong
ale
not
very
complex
bright
or
as
interesting
as
the
label
might
imply
good
but
not
great
maybe
worth
a
try
of
youre
really
down
with
pomegranate
i
dunno
pours
almost
no
head
which
was
awesome
cause
i
accidently
poured
the
end
of
it
to
fast
a
bit
to
quick
it
comes
in
one
of
those
big
bomber
bottles
and
you
know
when
you
think
its
almost
empty
but
its
not
yeah
one
of
those
so
it
smell
it
and
its
nothing
to
interesting
i
take
a
nice
swig
and
ugggghhh
what
the
fuck
is
this
its
not
bad
but
its
just
very
very
strange
whereas
most
beers
that
are
brewed
with
lemon
or
orange
only
have
a
hint
of
this
flavor
to
em
this
is
just
like
fermented
juice
almost
totally
took
me
by
suprise
almost
enough
to
make
me
say
i
didnt
want
to
drink
anymore
luckily
though
i
decided
to
keep
drinking
it
after
a
few
sips
i
think
ive
come
around
its
not
something
that
im
going
to
go
out
of
my
way
to
ever
get
again
but
its
definately
worth
trying
if
you
can
get
ahold
of
it
i
think
if
you
like
a
fruitier
tasting
beer
you
will
like
this
not
really
my
taste
though
i
liked
the
beer
because
i
have
never
had
anything
like
it
but
it
is
a
bid
of
an
oddball
and
a
bit
to
sweet
when
i
was
drinking
this
i
assumed
that
it
would
be
classified
as
a
fruit
beer
but
am
pleased
to
see
it
in
the
strong
ale
category
i
did
not
change
my
score
as
it
is
still
fitting
wellabove
the
typical
fruit
beer
but
just
good
as
a
strong
aleimp
amber
it
is
interesting
and
tasty
enough
to
check
out
for
sure
d
easy
to
drink
and
enjoyable
inferior
to
the
genesis
in
my
opinion
id
have
again
if
i
found
it
ontap
hebrew
origin
pomegranate
ale
while
pretty
good
beer
has
to
be
called
a
disappointment
i
was
hoping
to
like
it
as
much
as
i
liked
the
beer
that
inspired
it
but
something
seems
to
have
been
lost
in
the
translation
maybe
20000
luscious
pomegranates
per
batch
is
the
answer
the
beer
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
dry
roasted
scent
along
with
a
mild
pomegranate
aroma
its
roasted
with
a
warming
aroma
the
taste
is
decent
as
well
it
has
a
warm
crystal
malt
flavor
along
with
a
slightly
acidic
pomegranate
flavor
the
fruit
doesnt
seem
to
blend
well
with
the
boldness
of
the
beer
it
has
a
roasted
quality
as
well
as
a
burnt
toffee
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
an
above
average
beer
but
nothing
i
would
buy
again
the
two
sides
just
dont
fit
together
dump
the
pomegranate
hebrew
origin
pomegranate
ale
pours
a
light
copper
color
with
an
off
white
head
from
a
brown
twenty
two
ounce
bottle
the
aroma
is
malty
and
fruity
the
flavor
is
mostly
malty
there
is
a
bit
of
fruit
but
i
cant
particularly
distinguish
it
as
pomegranate
fairly
bitter
in
the
finish
the
bitterness
seems
to
linger
too
no
hop
flavors
stand
out
this
one
is
all
about
the
malt
not
bad
but
not
anything
id
go
out
of
the
way
for
either
overall
not
a
bad
beer
very
interesting
and
worth
a
try
would
buy
it
again
a
big
beer
and
a
big
malty
amber
ale
and
although
the
pomegranate
helps
accentuate
it
it
is
not
a
major
player
in
the
flavour
profile
overall
this
beer
captures
the
pomegranate
taste
very
well
but
it
still
somehow
doesnt
work
sometimes
it
feels
too
sweet
from
the
strong
caramel
malt
backbone
and
sometimes
it
feels
too
bitter
and
a
bit
tart
from
the
pomegranate
it
just
doesnt
work
for
me
d
not
a
bad
beer
overall
but
a
bit
heavy
for
regular
consumption
mouthfeel
is
smooth
though
somewhat
thin
flavors
are
overwhelmingly
fruity
with
the
pomegranate
dominating
throughout
and
leaving
a
harsh
bitter
taste
in
the
finish
alcohol
is
nicely
masked
though
apparent
towards
the
end
of
my
first
glass
this
is
enjoyable
if
you
like
fruit
beers
but
i
wouldnt
consider
it
an
imperial
amber
ale
or
the
american
strong
ale
as
it
is
labled
on
ba
i
have
not
been
a
huge
fan
of
the
strong
ales
but
this
beer
will
make
me
a
repeat
buyer
and
will
make
go
after
more
strong
ales
aftertaste
is
all
hop
bitterness
dry
finish
with
a
medium
body
and
light
effervescence
a
decent
beer
but
more
ipalike
to
my
palate
than
an
amber
or
strong
ale
no
pomegranate
found
either
too
bad
i
really
think
this
should
be
classified
as
a
fruit
beer
rather
than
an
american
strong
ale
and
i
think
that
was
the
brewers
intention
as
well
drinkability
and
notes
this
thing
is
8
but
ill
finish
off
the
bottle
it
was
interesting
to
try
but
i
dont
think
ill
ever
pick
it
up
again
if
offered
ill
drink
it
but
this
seemed
more
like
a
novelty
thing
to
me
good
beer
but
i
wont
bother
with
it
again
what
an
interesting
beer
double
amber
with
a
natural
cranberrypomegranate
juice
background
only
i
like
hebrew
beers
quite
a
bit
but
this
beer
just
seems
like
a
nice
idea
that
doesnt
fully
work
ooohh
that
must
be
pomegranate
flavor
its
juicy
there
are
some
pacific
nw
hops
flavors
in
there
too
but
they
stay
out
of
the
fruits
way
for
the
most
part
drinkability
failry
drinkable
not
great
d
i
could
drink
this
sucker
all
day
although
its
sweetness
would
make
it
more
suited
to
an
aftermeal
dessert
type
of
ale
and
some
may
find
the
sweetness
too
much
but
not
me
carbonation
is
alright
and
this
beer
isnt
hard
to
drink
but
it
could
be
more
enjoyable
noticeable
alcohol
kicks
the
drinkability
down
a
notch
or
two
not
much
carbonation
in
this
one
as
evidenced
by
the
feeble
hiss
let
out
by
the
cracked
crown
an
aggressive
pour
yields
about
an
inch
and
a
half
of
beaten
eggwhite
textured
foam
perched
atop
a
copper
colored
beer
the
aroma
is
similar
to
many
amber
ales
but
with
a
hint
of
pomegranate
in
the
mix
the
taste
is
very
subtle
good
balance
between
the
malt
hops
and
pomegranate
although
i
had
anticipated
and
hoped
for
a
bit
more
pomegranate
character
i
think
i
was
looking
for
a
little
more
of
a
wow
factor
considering
the
strength
and
novelty
of
this
brew
overall
its
good
but
just
doesnt
quite
sizzle

hebrew
is
one
of
those
beers

i

avoided

them
to

gimmicky
the

i

a
bomber
recommended
and
worth
trying
this
was
from
a
22
oz
bomber
and
poured
a
slightly
cloudy
amber
color
with
a
big
white
head
that
slowly
faded
leaving
good
lacing
great
nose
on
this
beer
with
lots
of
fruits
and
pomegranate
aromas
along
with
citrus
hops
but
basically
you
can
detect
the
pomegranate
in
this
beer
and
it
is
not
overwhelming
at
all
good
clean
mouthfeel
flavor
is
again
pomegranate
nicely
balanced
with
the
hops
and
is
nice
and
subtle
and
the
finish
is
a
nice
bitter
that
is
long
and
enjoyable
overall
this
beer
is
unique
and
very
easy
to
drink
extremely
drinkable
and
even
refreshing
for
a
strong

very
solid

in

didnt
do
it

taste
is
lightly
sweet

cant
tell
if
the

comes
from

love
this
beer
when
i
first
heard
of
the
hebrew
beers
i
thought
what
a
marketing
move
and
didnt
think
much
of
themuntil
i
tried
themi
am
hooked
overall
wow
my
first
kosher
beer
and
a
pomegranate
beer
at
that
this
one
is
a
solid
pleaser
good
looking
good
tasting
easy
drinking
if
you
spot
one
pick
it
up
not
anything
id
stock
up
on
but
i
wouldnt
pass
it
up
if
given
the
chance
again
recommended
d
tasty
and
enjoyable
with
an
alcohol
content
that
is
hardly
noticeable
an
easy
drinking
beer
that
is
definitely
worth
a
try
and
probably
worth
revisiting
smells
immediately
are
a
bit
fruity
im
not
a
big
pomegranate
fan
but
i
suppose
that
is
what
comes
through
good
malt
and
earthy
aromas
as
well
taste
isnt
as
fruity
as
a
beer
with
pomagranate
in
the
name
as
you
think
it
would
great
earthy
flavors
mostly
malty
with
a
bit
of
sweetness
hops
are
pretty
tame
in
this
beer
as
they
should
be
great
strong
flavors
all
around
recommended
at
least
to
try
d
quite
smooth
and
flavorfull
it
reminds
me
of
a
nice
barleywine
i
cant
detect
much
that
is
distinctly
pomegranite
flavored
but
that
is
no
reason
to
complain
about
a
beer
this
nice
drinkability
one
bomber
is
probably
enough
for
dinner
and
after
dinner
i
would
consider
buying
this
again
and
it
was
pretty
reasonable
5
dollars
for
the
bomber
the
8
alcohol
is
hidden
fairly
well
pours
very
clear
and
bright
its
a
base
of
medium
amber
with
pinkish
orange
highlights
the
head
is
pretty
thin
the
aroma
has
some
tealike
sweetness
to
it
along
with
a
plummy
fruitiness
on
the
palate
some
metallic
twang
first
off
before
things
sweeten
a
bit
with
caramel
malts
and
fruit
juice
then
dry
out
with
a
couple
different
hop
sensations
some
english
earthyness
and
a
bit
of
american
pineinfused
hops
both
of
which
form
some
substantial
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
light
and
highly
carbonated
with
plenty
of
hop
resins
and
some
sharp
hop
afterflavors
overall
this
is
a
good
fruit
beer
but
it
doesnt
come
close
to
the
genesis
pomegranate
ale
from
hebrew
each
part
of
this
beer
is
decent
but
the
hop
flavors
never
really
gel
with
the
pomegranate
notes
body
is
medium
to
big
slick
slippery
and
creamy
textured
average
drinkability
i
was
a
bit
underwhelmed
by
this
one
although
its
rather
unique
poured
amber
with
a
1
finger
head
looked
tasty
smelled
of
sweet
caramel
malts
with
some
fruit
hints
but
not
necessarily
pomegranate
i
could
sense
some
berry
flavor
in
there
as
well
the
taste
was
solid
malty
with
fruit
undertones
and
well
complimented
with
hops
to
give
it
a
crisp
lightly
bitter
dry
finish
no
trace
of
alochol
many
fruit
beers
get
it
wrong
the
taste
is
dominated
by
fruit
and
has
malt
compliments
this
beer
gets
it
right
malt
taste
with
fruit
compliments
ill
give
these
guys
props
for
making
some
really
interesting
beers
lately
but
unfortunately
they
have
not
really
been
all
that
good
they
are
not
bad
either
but
that
isnt
quite
what
i
am
looking
for
in
a
beer
this
is
drinkable
but
just
doesnt
quite
seem
to
work
an
easy
to
drink
ale
that
completely
hides
the
alcohol
content
this
could
put
a
hurting
on
the
unsuspecting
beer
drinker
from
the
22oz
bottle
poure
with
a
substantial
amount
of
airy
head
over
a
highly
sheened
lightreddish
amber
glossy
brew
i
cant
say
that
i
can
discern
any
special
aroma
here
if
any
at
all
as
i
sip
its
also
difficult
to
differentiate
any
distinguishable
flavor
i
get
a
smooth
malty
beer
but
as
it
warms
there
is
this
unidentifiable
earthy
warmth
id
initially
identify
it
as
a
big
dark
honey
but
this
must
be
the
pomegranate
at
work
i
can
honestly
say
i
have
no
idea
what
a
pomegranate
tastes
like
let
alone
prejudge
whether
it
belongs
in
beer
this
is
a
strong
lightly
colored
ale
with
the
body
and
flavor
of
a
darker
richer
brew
warm
and
heartening

drinkable

nothing
special
i
had
hoped
to
taste

its
really
more
of
an
afterthought
worth
a
try
but
dont
expect
too
much

faintly
like
pomegranates
which
is
surprising
taste
is
a
bit
like
a
good
ipa
very
hoppy
but
very
well
balanced
very
smooth
slightly
drying
moutfeel
quite
possibly
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
ive
had
a
few
and
dont
give
that
praise
easily
the
body
is
a
deep
orange
color
with
bright
orange
highlights
topped
by
a
small
white
head
that
promptly
disappears
understated
aroma
of
sweet
caramel
malt
some
dark
fruit
and
a
touch
of
lightly
spicy
pomegranate
juice
palate
is
a
blend
of
caramel
malt
and
some
light
fruity
hops
the
pomegranate
flavor
emerges
midpalate
and
imparts
a
significant
dry
bitterness
towards
the
finish
the
malt
profile
becomes
a
bit
more
agreeable
as
the
beer
warms
taking
on
a
mildly
sweet
biscuity
character
body
is
substantial
but
the
low
level
of
carbonation
makes
it
seem
a
little
thin
for
such
a
strong
beer
a
decent
offering
great
hop
flavor
with
a
good
balance
of
maltiness
had
this
on
tap
at
the
holy
grail
in
frisco
tasted
like
cough
medicine
maybe
it
had
gone
bad
but
whatever
it
was
this
was
not
at
all
what
i
had
expected
one
of
those
beers
that
has
nothing
particularly
wrong
with
it
but
doesnt
have
anything
particularly
right
with
it
either
very
nice
somewhat
hoppy
but
nice
malt
notes
too
similar
to
a
amberred
ale
in
that
respect
medium
bodied
nice
taste
terrific
with
my
fish
and
chips
one
of
the
best
offerings
in
texas
the
musthave
from
this
brewery
this
is
the
best
stout
ive
ever
had
the
chance
to
drink
im
a
big
fan
of
dark
sweet
beers
and
this
is
as
good
as
it
gets
for
me
great
beer
solid
choice
overall
easy
drinking
at
a
local
pub
needs
to
clean
their
lines
better
similar
to
a
blue
moon
with
mild
hops
and
good
flavor
after
drinking
one
below
average
texas
beers
after
another
i
ordered
the
velvet
hammer
thank
god
for
texas
breweries
it
is
a
flavorful
beer
with
quite
a
lot
going
for
it
the
flavor
definitely
is
a
good
one
but
in
a
way
that
it
changes
as
you
drink
it
some
beers
have
only
one
note
this
is
an
exception
enjoy
a
malty
strong
ale
the
has
enough
hops
to
balance
it
out
plenty
of
alcohol
showing
but
works
well
with
all
components
glad
i
had
a
chance
to
try
this
o
strong
offering
from
a
local
brewery
creamysmooth
nature
is
very
nice
for
the
strong
alestout
category
o
this
is
a
big
favorite
down
here
since
you
see
it
everywhere
definitely
seems
like
an
imperial
red
ale
meets
the
catchall
style
of
an
american
strong
definitely
an
enjoyable
malty
treat
d
sip
and
enjoy
overall
a
decent
offering
that
slants
a
bit
too
much
on
the
sweet
side
for
my
palate
though
i
recognize
that
is
a
characteristic
of
the
style
overall
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
local
brews
these
days
big
ups
interesting
imperial
red
ale
with
a
mellow
mouth
feel
and
a
nice
balance
it
starts
out
hoppy
but
it
is
well
balanced
with
the
malt
in
the
beer
and
it
leads
to
a
surprisingly
smooth
experience
finishes
with
a
bit
of
an
alcohol
aftertaste
although
not
unpleasant
by
any
means
id
definitely
get
another
one
next
time
im
there
and
would
highly
recommend
this
is
my
new
favorite
beer
until
the
next
one
had
it
a
few
times
at
various
places
around
town
color
is
reddishorange
with
a
slight
haze
aroma
is
a
pungent
pineyness
with
a
twist
i
am
very
curious
about
the
types
of
hops
they
have
used
in
this
brew
good
body
and
mouthfeel
make
this
a
very
drinkable
beer
despite
its
size
abv
and
og
good
rich
malty
carmaelly
flavor
but
not
at
the
expense
of
the
hops
i
will
be
drinking
this
whenever
i
can
id
love
to
see
more
of
it
from
peticolas
i
cant
wait
to
try
their
scottish
ale
on
tap
at
the
holy
grail
pub
in
plano
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
orangebrown
color
with
a
tan
head
the
aroma
has
a
lot
of
sweet
caramel
notes
with
some
cherries
and
dark
fruit
as
well
as
a
little
bit
of
pine
the
flavor
is
more
of
the
same
i
get
some
pine
and
orange
notes
from
the
hops
as
well
as
some
caramel
and
cherries
the
alcohol
is
definitely
present
but
doesnt
hinder
the
drinkability
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
overall
quite
good
tastes
of
scorched
caramel
earthy
malts
accompanied
by
a
gentle
pleasant
oakiness
a
spicy
burning
boozines
gets
calmed
by
sweet
malts
and
hints
of
vanilla
while
the
wooden
oak
notes
settle
down
on
the
back
of
the
palate
has
a
high
sparkling
carbonation
which
pushes
malt
sweetness
on
a
detectable
level
during
the
finish
with
warming
wooden
alcoholic
hints
in
the
background
o
a
big
beer
but
well
balanced
and
well
integrated
with
the
barrel
notes
verdict
im
not
sure
the
base
beer
held
up
to
the
barrels
but
there
is
a
lot
of
complexity
the
balance
is
poor
for
the
most
part
but
its
still
an
enjoyable
brew
its
big
bold
and
pretty
in
your
face
but
its
remarkably
quaffable
my
glass
was
nearly
empty
before
i
knew
it
m
portlike
mouthfeeloverall
medium
bodied
verging
on
full
with
an
excellent
level
of
fine
carbonation
by
no
means
does
it
drink
to
the
level
of
its
abv
just
about
perfect
overall
extremely
impressed
with
this
just
about
a
perfect
level
of
barrel
aging
presence
i
need
to
pick
up
more
of
these
i
have
been
extremely
impressed
with
every
prairie
artisan
beer
i
have
tried
and
this
one
is
no
exception
very
good
o
this
is
a
big
beer
but
well
blended
and
cut
with
some
nice
alcohol
makes
this
a
great
sipper
it
would
be
nice
to
have
a
bit
more
malt
forward
but
it
is
still
very
tasty
overall
good
stuff
thanks
again
for
all
the
tasty
brews
will
very
tasty
the
heft
does
get
to
you
rather
quickly
i
preferred
this
on
draft
vice
the
bottle
i
tried
months
ago
if
i
ever
see
any
more
bottles
i
will
scoop
em
up
they
will
age
nicely
im
sure
deep
brown
shortlived
khaki
head
that
collapses
to
a
few
swamp
bubbles
big
booziness
right
off
the
bat
working
through
that
some
thick
caramel
prune
ripe
apple
coarse
wood
toffee
and
a
dusting
of
coffee
grounds
more
booze
on
the
finish
huge
whiskey
note
much
more
like
a
massive
english
barleywine
than
any
type
of
brown
ale
carbonation
is
low
even
taking
style
into
consideration
lots
of
flavors
going
on
the
booziness
is
a
little
much
even
for
a
13
barrel
aged
beer
i
wish
i
had
another
one
of
these
to
try
in
a
year
overall
good
flavors
but
its
really
boozy
not
what
i
expected
at
all
o
the
whiskey
barrel
presence
is
prominent
and
the
base
beer
is
difficult
to
appreciate
i
think
id
would
have
liked
this
much
better
with
some
age
but
im
not
convinced
the
base
beer
is
where
it
needs
to
be
in
the
flavor
department
for
an
outstanding
rating
carbonation
is
good
a
touch
on
the
high
side
but
i
think
it
moves
the
beer
along
this
is
a
fantastic
barrel
aged
beer
prairie
is
for
real
they
know
what
theyre
doing
standard
lineup

funky

c
pours
a
murky
brown
with
a
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
tiny
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
dark
roasted
malt
cocoa
and
whiskey
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
cocoa
and
whiskey
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
a
woody
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
with
a
slightly
better
barrel
aged
presence
in
the
smell
a
big
flavors
all
around
the
gums
go
numb
after
swishing
this
stuff
around
in
your
mouth
it
packs
a
punch
and
delivers
on
flavor
lots
of
whiskey
vanilla
with
just
the
right
amount
of
chocolate
as
big
as
this
beer
is
i
found
myself
taking
bigger
drinks
than
i
would
normally
for
this
kind
of
brew
its
good
to
see
that
prairie
has
another
side
very
nice
love
how
the
complexity
of
flavors
all
gel
together
smoothly
another
impressive
offering
from
the
brewery
and
probably
my
favorite
of
theirs
so
far
othis
comes
across
as
an
english
barleywine
that
spent
some
time
in
a
barrel
more
than
a
brown
ale
beautifully
balanced
and
integrated
while
remaining
somewhat
assertive
a
real
treat
jd
im
not
typically
a
fan
of
fruit
themed
brews
but
this
is
quite
tasty
the
fruit
is
very
aromatic
but
still
very
balanced
to
taste
great
if
youre
sitting
down
for
one
or
two
like
a
sweet
raspberry
ale
maybe
the
keg
was
bad
but
not
much
body
this
is
not
your
girlfriends
gateway
fruit
beer
well
balanced
malty
sweetness
bitterness
strong
ale
that
is
cloudy
in
appearance
and
supports
a
healthy
dose
of
fresh
raspberry
tart
wo
being
too
sweet
can
have
more
than
one
pint
the
raspberries
really
kick
in
more
so
in
the
taste
than
the
aroma
suggests
it
certainly
has
a
boozy
and
malty
quality
to
it
but
the
raspberries
introduce
themselves
with
a
passion
this
will
leave
a
mark
spinning
head
this
is
a
tremendously
novel
approach
and
kudos
for
the
effort
for
the
most
part
its
got
barleywine
character
with
natural
raspberry
flavor
o
debated
a
long
time
between
a
3
75
and
a
4
but
i
would
say
this
pushes
the
boundaries
of
an
outstanding
raspberry
brandywine
style
ale
thank
you
bbc
poured
into
a
16
snifter
not
sure
when
it
was
bottled
but
i
am
sure
it
wasnt
too
many
months
ago
pours
a
bright
ruby
red
with
a
one
inch
white
head
that
settles
fairly
quickly
leaving
behind
little
streams
of
lace
smell
is
raspberry
biscuit
dark
fruit
caramel
honey
and
hints
of
vanilla
taste
is
tart
raspberry
up
front
vanilla
biscuit
caramel
and
plum
body
is
almost
medium
nice
carbonation
a
little
dry
and
very
drinkable
for
9
this
is
solid
cant
wait
to
try
the
normal
barleywine
o
a
tasty
though
tart
brew
raspberry
flavor
is
strong
but
not
very
sweet
interesting
to
try
but
although
i
am
a
huge
fan
of
raspberry
flavorthe
tartness
here
is
too
sharp
for
my
taste
however
those
who
like
belgian
saisons
and
lambics
should
really
enjoy
this
i
love
just
about
everything
bbc
puts
out
except
their
american
wheat
i
thought
that
was
terrible
this
is
another
great
beverage
of
theirs
and
is
the
first
barleywine
ive
tasted
that
ive
really
enjoyed
t
opens
with
a
lot
of
puréed
raspberry
sweetness
almost
a
hint
of
chocolate
in
there
as
well
like
a
raspberry
truffle
a
bit
of
tartness
before
a
lingering
finish
of
unripe
red
cherry
some
caramel
malt
and
some
cherry
pit
finishes
a
touch
dry
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
under
carbonated
and
really
smooth
which
brings
out
even
more
of
the
sweetness
definitely
a
dessert
beer
not
getting
barleywine
from
this
but
its
pretty
tasty
overall
good
for
a
fruity
beer
but
nothing
like
a
barleywine
good
dessert
beer
but
not
an
all
the
time
thing
at
all
overall
a
nice
beer
not
very
barleywiney
or
strong
but
nice
o
this
wasnt
awful
not
a
drainpour
but
certainly
not
great
the
raspberry
flavor
was
not
right
and
despite
the
label
it
had
very
little
if
indeed
any
barleywine
characteristics
pours
reddish
amber
with
thick
head
of
white
foam
that
settles
down
to
14
inch
fruity
raspberry
smell
tart
astringent
thin
taste
some
cough
syrup
flavor
at
the
close
the
fruit
keeps
the
flavor
in
check
but
the
aftertaste
is
a
bit
too
much
light
mouthfeel
overall
not
great
would
not
buy
again
o
pretty
tasty
for
a
raspberry
ale
but
it
doesnt
have
any
of
the
barleywine
notes
i
normally
look
for
still
quite
nice
odi
have
wanted
to
try
this
for
a
while
i
enjoyed
it
as
i
do
most
raspberrythemed
beers
one
glass
was
enough
because
it
was
very
rich
altogether
a
nice
barleywine
poured
a
1
5
pale
flesh
colored
head
average
lifespan
the
body
in
masstone
looks
like
brown
iced
tea
but
held
to
the
light
its
an
amber
verging
on
maroon
the
smell
reminds
me
of
instant
vitamin
drink
we
bought
once
from
colombia
like
a
fortified
fruit
the
taste
is
a
little
malty
but
has
some
flat
raspberry
in
there
all
in
all
its
kind
of
like
a
weak
fruit
pastry
and
the
bottle
says
barleywine
but
i
dont
see
any
of
the
barleywine
style
in
this
notes
glad
to
see
this
get
back
to
being
a
barleywine
it
has
been
years
since
ive
had
it
and
the
last
time
i
did
my
palate
was
certainly
not
as
developed
as
it
is
now
i
seem
to
remember
it
being
a
bit
out
of
control
back
then
though
just
a
raspberry
bomb
and
not
much
else
it
was
much
better
this
time
around
certainly
worth
a
try
and
at
6
a
bomber
you
have
nothing
to
lose
overall
ok
6
00
out
the
door
not
so
cheap
but
it
is
bbc
and
it
also
is
9
and
the
beer
is
quite
good
not
the
best
bbc
i
have
every
had
but
above
average
for
bbc
but
also
2
00
more
a
bottle
then
most
bbc
beers
overall
this
isnt
a
sorority
house
fruit
beer
this
one
will
invite
you
in
with
its
seductive
looks
and
scent
then
it
will
knock
you
on
your
ass
a
sipper
that
begs
the
unknowing
to
quaff
amazing
o
i
aged
the
bottle
for
a
year
and
im
annoyed
that
i
havent
seen
any
other
bottles
i
hope
this
wasnt
retired
because
this
brew
is
awesome
get
some
if
not
for
you
then
get
it
and
send
some
to
me
really
cool
beer
its
more
of
a
fruit
beer
than
a
barley
wine
i
agree
with
the
old
name
that
it
is
a
raspberry
strong
ale
super
cool
beer
that
makes
other
fruit
beers
cower
in
shame
o
surprisingly
very
good
was
a
bit
skeptical
going
in
but
really
enjoyed
this
beer
very
drinkable
with
very
little
sign
of
abv
o
amazing
beer
will
certainly
buy
many
more
bottles
as
time
progresses
amazing
use
of
the
fruit
finally
a
great
fruit
beer
d
a
very
bizarre
beer
i
appreciate
the
chance
to
try
it
but
this
tries
to
be
too
many
things
at
once
very
hard
to
put
down
and
just
overall
very
muddy
and
confusing
pours
a
moderate
amber
color
with
a
decent
white
head
and
a
bit
of
light
lacing
on
the
way
down
the
nose
carries
quite
a
bit
of
raspberry
along
with
some
caramel
malts
and
a
bit
of
toasted
bread
as
well
the
flavor
isnt
quite
as
multifaceted
as
the
nose
with
the
raspberries
really
taking
over
and
everything
else
taking
a
back
seat
the
feel
is
fairly
sweet
with
a
bit
of
raspberry
tartness
medium
body
overall
a
bit
heavy
on
the
raspberries
perhaps
a
candidate
for
aging
thanks
for
getting
me
to
try
this
cuzco
drinkability
this
beer
slides
down
with
incredible
ease
the
slightly
tart
yet
incredibly
sweet
fruit
presence
is
not
overwhelming
instead
it
is
integrated
yet
pronounced
berkshire
always
finds
a
way
to
create
balanced
and
drinkable
brews
this
is
no
exception
one
of
my
favorite
things
is
how
much
the
malt
comes
through
to
balance
the
raspberries
a
well
done
fruit
beer
approachable
balanced
and
a
nice
change
of
pace
for
my
usual
belgian
filled
fridge
pours
a
pinkish
half
finger
of
mixed
sized
bubbles
quite
lovely
body
is
maroon
and
clear
smells
of
raspberries
of
course
fresh
smelling
even
a
few
months
old
some
carmel
malts
phenols
or
esters
im
not
sure
its
a
barley
wine
pleasant
alcohol
smell
tastes
fruity
and
tart
some
carmel
english
bready
yeast
in
two
different
glasses
one
was
poured
more
vigorously
and
it
mellowed
it
out
quite
a
bit
it
knocked
the
carbonation
down
and
it
accentuated
the
fruit
the
finish
is
a
bit
tart
a
touch
of
bitterness
and
some
english
bready
yeast
medium
full
bodied
light
carbing
overall
very
nice
complex
refined
flavors
everything
plays
well
together
ill
easily
get
this
again

a
bomber
this
beer
pours
a
nice
copper
color
with
a
nice
reddish
tinge
to
it
the
smell
is
malty
with
a
nice
raspberry
scent
in
there
the
taste
follows
suit
with
a
sweet
malty
raspberry
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
full
with
low
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
would
definitely
buy
again
d
fairly
drinkable
a
bit
to
sweet
pours
a
deep
reddish
brown
color
with
a
short
tight
bubbly
off
white
head
a
constant
carb
stream
rises
from
the
bottom
of
my
glass
like
bubbles
in
a
fish
tank
smells
sweet
and
malty
with
layers
of
caramel
raisins
cherries
toffee
lightly
tart
raspberries
the
flavor
starts
off
sweet
with
caramel
and
toffee
but
almost
immediately
is
overcome
by
raspberries
the
raisins
cherries
and
prunes
battle
to
be
the
dominant
flavor
half
way
through
and
linger
with
a
bit
of
fusel
alcohol
in
the
finish
sweet
sticky
mouthfeel
medium
body
and
level
of
carbonation
nice
sipper
if
not
a
little
sweet
a
little
less
raspberry
and
fusel
heat
would
help
this
one
immensely
the
alcohol
is
not
hidden
in
this
brew
it
crosses
the
border
of
being
more
of
a
fruit
beer
with
an
extra
medicinal
alcohol
kick
its
an
interesting
concept
but
the
recipe
needs
some
tweaking
to
bring
this
back
into
beer
territory
it
leaves
me
with
the
impression
of
being
a
fruity
carbonated
cocktail
that
my
wife
or
non
beer
drinking
friends
would
probably
enjoy
medium
to
full
in
the
feel
the
carbonation
level
was
quite
low
i
had
no
issue
finishing
my
glass
but
im
glad
it
was
a
short
pour
i
probably
wouldnt
have
this
again
overall
a
really
nice
surprise
i
wish
i
would
have
picked
up
a
few
more
bottles
or
this
particular
berkshire
brew
would
make
it
to
nh
i
really
love
the
unrestrained
approach
with
the
raspberries
i
will
definitely
grab
another
bottle
of
this
sometime
d
no
alc
detected
easy
to
sip
on
would
like
to
see
if
age
does
this
beer
any
good
might
mellow
out
the
aftertaste
d
i
would
only
recommend
one
of
these
beers
because
it
is
very
sweet
high
in
alcohol
and
large
in
amount
i
really
like
the
beer
but
i
wish
it
were
available
in
12
ounces
d
ugh
this
stuff
just
isnt
pleasant
at
all
i
dont
know
if
age
would
help
with
this
or
just
make
one
big
mess
it
was
all
downhill
from
the
nice
looking
pour
summertime
and
the
livin
is
easy
d
would
not
drink
again
md
medium
body
with
a
crisp
carbonation
very
hard
to
finish
because
of
the
flavor
i
love
berkshire
brewing
and
they
are
probably
one
of
my
favorite
ma
brewing
companies
but
this
beer
has
some
serious
problems
upon
letting
the
glass
warm
more
of
the
raspberry
is
unlocked
its
just
a
few
notches
too
sweet
for
me
i
can
imagine
this
takes
on
a
whole
new
personality
after
a
bit
of
aging
but
i
wont
be
buying
another
bottle
to
find
out
i
enjoy
the
raspberry
in
this
even
if
its
light
and
it
is
surpassed
by
a
strong
toasty
malt
body
w
moderate
alcohol
flavor
w
light
tanginess
from
the
fruit
w
fruitiness
apparent
but
subtle
the
smooth
flavor
borders
on
sweet
w
slight
spicy
tinge
and
mild
honeylike
malt
in
the
finish
i
enjoyed
this
on
christmas
and
my
mom
and
wife
elected
to
partake
in
sharing
the
beer
with
my
brother
and
me
i
found
it
a
good
strong
ale
w
raspberry
flavor
but
i
couldnt
really
see
more
than
12
a
bomber
in
a
sitting
it
is
pretty
dry
and
tastes
like
it
would
have
been
better
fresh
i
guess
the
advice
is
have
one
now
and
get
one
to
try
later
for
cellaring
d
this
one
was
a
interesting
one
the
flavor
on
this
beer
reminded
me
of
koolaid
at
times
but
i
tended
to
drink
a
lot
of
it
and
fast
i
would
have
no
problem
drinking
a
ton
of
this
but
i
think
my
stomach
might
hurt
afterwards
though
from
the
sugary
sweetness
m
d
quite
full
bodied
a
little
slick
but
too
sweettart
to
really
savour
not
the
balance
i
may
have
hoped
for
raspberry
barleywine
style
ale
is
not
good
beer
its
not
horrendous
or
bad
it
just
doesnt
resemble
a
barleywine
at
all
its
much
more
of
a
raspberry
flavored
beverage
id
go
back
to
the
drawing
board
with
this
one
perhaps
even
scrap
it
all
together
if
youre
into
all
things
raspberry
you
might
like
this
otherwise
take
a
pass
d
not
that
great
way
too
sweet
for
me
and
i
really
struggled
to
get
through
this
one
clear
burnt
orange
colour
with
a
persistent
cap
of
fine
beige
bubbles
sticky
spotty
lacing
smells
of
cotton
candy
quite
sweet
with
toasted
malts
im
getting
more
of
a
strawberry
vibe
from
it
rather
than
raspberry
ok
now
i
get
the
raspberry
in
the
flavour
particularly
up
front
mild
to
moderate
bitterness
balanced
towards
malt
sweetness
that
blends
fairly
well
with
the
berries
more
toasted
malt
in
the
finish
along
with
a
sweet
berry
flavour
that
bordered
on
artificial
tasting
and
peppery
alcohol
mild
alcohol
warmth
full
bodied
average
carbonation
not
bad
but
i
probably
wouldnt
seek
it
out
again
d
the
flavors
were
fairly
nice
but
after
awhile
the
sweetness
was
just
too
much
for
me
this
is
definitely
a
beer
to
only
have
a
small
pour
of
yet
the
brewery
puts
it
in
a
22
oz
bottle
its
a
pretty
full
bodied
beer
and
moderately
carbonated
drinkability
for
me
was
good
the
raspberry
flavors
were
really
better
then
i
expected
barleywine
flavor
was
decent
raspberry
flavor
was
good
together
overall
it
was
pretty
good
the
flavors
worked
relatively
nicely
together
to
make
a
pretty
good
beer
raspberry
barleywine
style
ale
is
definitely
not
one
of
berkshires
more
accomplished
efforts
it
might
have
been
better
in
june
of
2009
but
one
year
isnt
long
enough
to
have
turned
good
beer
into
barely
average
beer
thanks
to
gbvdave
for
the
bottle
md
medium
bodied
and
very
sticky
good
feel
overall
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
but
a
well
done
fruit
beer
overall
good
but
too
sweet
for
my
taste
definately
couldnt
drink
too
much
of
this
d
thanks
joe
for
the
chance
to
split
this
with
my
brother
in
law
certainly
enjoyable
but
it
would
have
been
more
so
with
some
additional
layers
of
flavor
f
still
pretty
sweet
with
lingering
syrupy
sweetness
maple
molasses
and
raspberry
pancake
syrup
lingering
raspberry
flavor
as
well
and
toasty
malts
a
slight
bitterness
too
a
slight
roasty
malt
flavor
starts
to
come
though
as
well
a
slight
dryness
also
comes
through
the
sweetness
somehow
d
this
doesnt
really
strike
me
as
a
barleywine
which
is
probably
why
this
is
listed
under
the
alias
of
a
strong
ale
either
way
this
beer
has
a
pretty
pleasant
raspberry
presence
although
the
flavor
is
somewhat
onedimensional
and
just
a
little
too
sweet
otherwise
quite
enjoyable
notes
im
generally
not
a
fan
of
berry
beers
but
this
almost
makes
me
reconsider
my
position
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
for
me
but
i
rather
enjoyed
it
i
saw
this
on
the
menu
and
had
to
have
it
i
will
say
that
this
one
hits
well
on
the
sensory
front
great
visual
appearance
with
the
rubyred
hue
and
fancylooking
lacing
and
the
strong
smell
of
raspberries
the
taste
doesnt
quite
ring
barleywine
to
me
but
it
is
very
good
nonetheless
with
the
raspberry
tartness
keeping
you
wanting
more
mf
is
somewhat
thin
with
a
wellmoderated
acidity
drinkable
to
the
fullest
much
enjoyed
d
solid
only
so
much
fruitiness
one
can
take
though
the
abv
masked
well
but
still
a
sipper
side
note
my
berkshire
rep
said
to
do
this
half
and
half
with
the
imperial
stout
now
thats
an
idea
d
i
really
liked
this
beer
alot
very
drinkable
with
a
ton
of
flavor
not
quite
a
barleywine
but
a
tasty
beer
overall
an
interesting
and
most
of
all
fresh
tasting
take
on
a
raspberry
ale
not
a
bad
brew
to
try
once
any
more
than
that
is
just
too
much
the
raspberry
flavor
is
a
little
too
heavy
in
the
mix
gets
sickening
really
quick
overall
a
very
interesting
take
on
the
use
of
raspberries
and
i
liked
it
not
mind
blowing
but
id
have
another
d
for
its
high
abv
this
beer
is
quite
drinkable
the
fruit
has
a
nice
interplay
of
sweet
and
sour
and
the
malts
hang
out
in
the
background
a
very
interesting
fruit
beer
that
is
well
achieved
4
0
a
tasty
treat
indeed
reminds
me
of
a
berrysyrup
infused
quasiwheatwine
mixed
with
weinhards
long
defunct
blackberry
wheat
beer
a
creative
effort
that
im
glad
i
got
to
try
but
now
that
my
curiosity
is
sated
this
beer
is
probably
not
something
id
want
to
revisit
d
its
tasty
but
not
likely
something
i
would
revisit
unless
it
was
fresh
it
tastes
more
like
a
raspberry
bubbly
or
alco
pop
than
a
beer
brewed
with
raspberries
but
if
you
like
raspberries
its
worth
a
try
d
i
want
more
i
will
buy
more
this
is
a
stupendous
beer
mad
props
to
the
store
owner
who
pointed
me
in
the
right
direction
i
have
never
had
a
raspberry
strong
alebarleywine
but
the
two
go
handinhand
so
perfectly
its
a
nobrainer
one
of
the
most
impressive
and
unique
beers
ive
had
in
a
while
the
flavor
ugh
artificial
medicinal
cloyingly
sweet
artificial
raspberry
candy
flavor
the
malt
is
grainy
and
out
of
place
the
alcohol
is
sharp
this
tastes
like
some
sort
of
cough
medicine
that
has
escaped
the
nightmare
world
to
plague
us
mortals
stay
far
away
from
this
beer
if
this
is
craft
beer
im
going
to
switch
to
budweiser
also
dont
let
your
girlfriend
or
wife
drink
this
stuff
unless
you
want
to
datebe
married
to
a
shapeless
blob
its
impossible
to
drink
this
without
developing
type
2
diabetes
imo
tastes
is
similiar
with
fresh
raspberries
and
chococaramel
malt
alcohol
comes
across
gently
in
a
tart
swallow
fits
that
hard
to
attain
profile
of
a
beer
with
a
strong
fruit
presence
yet
is
also
reinforced
by
an
outstanding
beer
presence
easily
a
very
drinkable
beer
although
i
would
say
it
may
be
a
bit
too
sweet
for
more
than
a
glass
glad
i
shared
this
bottle
with
my
girlfriend
a
very
interesting
brew
glad
i
had
the
opportunity
to
try
it
out
the
beer
is
somewhat
low
on
the
complexity
scale
but
incredibly
drinkable
its
somewhat
of
a
sweet
beer
one
thing
about
the
beer
when
i
bought
it
is
that
it
had
the
barleywine
label
and
for
the
style
this
is
remarkably
low
in
hops
and
i
dont
think
the
fg
is
high
enough
i
think
the
strong
ale
label
fit
better
the
raspberry
is
a
nice
touch
and
im
surprised
how
well
it
fit
into
the
beer
very
enjoyable
recommended
overall
a
disaster
i
would
not
want
to
repeat
pours
dark
amber
nice
average
sized
head
nothing
spectacular
in
the
appearance
department
smells
like
a
raspberry
fruit
beer
sweet
and
juicy
taste
is
a
little
stronger
though
at
first
real
bitter
living
up
to
the
billing
as
a
strong
ale
as
it
warms
it
loses
a
lot
of
the
bitterness
making
for
a
much
easier
drink
and
the
malt
starts
to
shine
through
a
bit
more
at
room
temp
becomes
more
of
a
strong
fruit
beer
rather
than
a
weak
strong
ale
or
barleywine
the
raspberry
provides
a
nice
little
tang
and
while
it
doesnt
have
so
much
as
a
kick
as
it
did
right
out
of
the
fridge
theres
still
a
bit
backing
it
its
not
to
syrupy
not
to
carbonated
just
right
just
could
use
some
refinement
in
the
drinkability
department
but
it
makes
a
nice
nightcap
for
the
summer
definitely
not
a
barleywine
still
pretty
good
stuff
this
for
me
would
be
a
nightcap
and
would
definitely
recommend
sharing
with
someone
overall
impression
really
nice
change
of
pace
beer
i
loved
it
and
will
definitely
have
to
seek
out
some
more
well
my
bomber
was
labeled
a
barleywine
so
right
off
the
bat
i
have
to
say
the
obvious
disconnect
in
results
was
a
little
disappointing
it
has
a
rosey
copper
color
with
a
goodly
oatmeal
color
head
and
great
lacing
the
aroma
is
a
pleasantly
sweet
raspberrycherry
over
very
subtle
malt
bread
enticing
if
you
accept
the
fruit
side
of
beer
the
taste
is
a
bit
shocking
with
syrupy
fruit
sweet
and
tart
a
dry
winelike
bite
on
the
tongue
the
feel
is
a
bit
thin
with
tiny
bubblage
not
very
drinkable
though
sort
of
chokes
you
with
the
tart
power
that
overwhelms
any
hint
of
what
might
make
this
a
barleywine
in
any
traditional
sense
of
course
i
now
see
that
this
is
apparently
not
a
barleywine
and
that
makes
sense
but
doesnt
much
change
my
mind
on
the
overall
rating
this
would
be
best
enjoyed
in
small
glasses
with
a
nice
piece
of
cheddar
cheese
an
after
dinner
change
up
but
this
is
not
even
worth
a
whole
pint
in
my
book
ultimately
this
is
a
nice
strong
ale
with
a
small
hint
of
raspberry
its
even
good
for
those
that
dont
like
fruit
beers
another
strong
release
for
bbc
caramel
and
toasted
malts
provide
the
backbone
and
the
berry
flavors
do
the
rest
there
is
a
moderate
carbonation
level
that
i
like
about
this
beer
the
9
abv
is
well
hidden
and
i
found
this
to
be
a
rather
interesting
brew
overall
wow
a
decent
beer
with
raspberry
here
an
interesting
twist
on
a
strong
ale
and
worth
a
try
at
least
once
even
if
you
dont
like
fruit
beers
drinkability
interesting
beer
i
think
i
might
only
be
able
to
have
2
of
these
might
get
me
sick
having
just
one
was
real
good
dont
get
me
wrong
it
just
was
too
sweet
i
would
of
dropped
some
freshh
raspberries
in
this
one
if
i
had
some
cant
say
i
would
drink
more
than
two
of
these
but
they
sure
are
delicious
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
but
only
buy
one
once
every
couple
of
months
or
so
as
one
of
these
satisfies
me
for
a
while
this
is
a
great
beer
no
questions
asked
they
brew
this
beer
with
real
raspberries
and
not
flavoring
the
initial
flavor
is
that
of
raspberry
pie
then
you
get
a
sweet
but
pleasant
flavor
leading
into
a
hint
of
raspberry
again
the
appearance
is
a
deep
amber
with
a
12
finger
head
awsome
awsome
beer
one
of
my
favorites
from
bbc
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
bit
thinner
than
what
i
would
expect
but
that
adds
to
the
drinkability
in
my
opinion
i
shared
this
with
my
wife
and
we
both
really
enjoyed
this
one
22oz
bomber
this
one
pours
a
rubyamber
color
there
was
a
bit
of
an
off
white
head
on
it
but
that
disappeared
to
nothing
very
quickly
no
lacing
at
all
the
nose
is
raspberry
not
overly
strong
but
it
masks
most
everything
else
i
get
a
whiff
of
alcohol
and
caramel
malt
coming
through
also
pretty
smooth
taste
some
raspberry
but
not
overly
done
some
caramel
malt
a
touch
of
sourness
to
the
finish
this
is
actually
pretty
good
id
definitely
buy
more
notes
from
122306
d
it
is
a
bit
too
sweet
and
sour
for
my
taste
the
thick
body
and
high
abv
make
it
a
week
candidate
for
a
session
brew
pretty
drinkable
for
a
9
abv
good
beer
overall
certainly
a
unique
beer
but
the
bitterness
doesnt
mesh
well
with
the
fruit
for
me
this
beer
says
bwine
on
the
label
but
i
thought
it
was
more
of
a
strong
ale
not
bwine
quality
just
yet
poured
copper
with
a
dirty
white
head
nose
was
raspberry
and
hops
plenty
of
of
both
taste
was
strong
abv
was
very
prominent
as
was
the
rasperry
however
it
was
well
hopped
but
malts
and
complexity
was
lacking
for
a
complete
bwine
this
beer
is
pretty
thing
for
a
bwine
however
in
one
year
of
good
cellaring
this
brew
could
hold
its
own
with
any
other
bwine
mouthfeel
was
hot
but
tasty
very
good
brew
you
get
an
inch
and
a
half
of
light
tan
head
with
an
array
of
rocky
bubbles
decent
retention
almost
no
lace
body
is
a
ruby
amber
in
color
very
attractive
nose
has
an
upfront
raspberry
feel
that
quickly
mixes
with
rich
candied
malt
enters
the
mouth
with
considerable
spunky
raspberry
funk
the
malt
balances
this
nicely
with
some
slightly
rich
and
minersly
notes
there
is
a
bit
of
a
sour
twang
on
the
back
sides
of
the
tongue
mouthfeel
is
a
mix
of
sour
richness
solid
drinkability
pours
a
gloriously
deep
ruby
red
color
offwhite
head
fades
slowly
into
a
substantial
foamy
ring
around
the
glass
lots
of
sticky
lacing
smell
is
rich
caramel
malt
and
an
absolute
facefull
of
fresh
raspberry
puree
wow
taste
is
all
raspberry
loads
of
tart
berries
but
it
all
comes
off
without
being
too
sweet
or
cloying
theres
a
rich
bitter
quality
to
the
fruitiness
thats
really
impressive
i
wish
the
beer
were
just
a
touch
thicker
but
its
a
small
complaint
about
an
otherwise
delicious
brew
still
somewhat
sticky
with
raspberry
flavor
that
lingers
on
and
on
i
think
this
is
phenomenal
appears
a
pink
ruby
tinged
copper
ale
slightly
clouded
body
with
an
of
white
pink
tinged
head
lacing
is
fine
and
spreads
evenly
aromatics
offer
tart
raspberry
some
grainy
malt
sweetness
pretty
weak
and
muted
with
only
raspberry
sweetness
coming
through
for
me
flavor
is
tart
sickly
sweet
raspberry
notes
masking
any
traditional
strong
ale
or
barleywine
as
this
brew
was
labeled
definitely
floods
the
palate
with
strong
fruit
presence
funk
mouthfeel
is
cloying
with
sticky
raspberry
extracts
this
is
pretty
horrible
stuff
hard
to
get
off
your
palate
to
boot
drinkability
is
pretty
piss
pour
not
much
barleywine
or
old
ale
definitely
a
strong
fruit
beer
the
type
that
i
usually
detest
the
verdict
stays
the
same
with
this
one
so
many
off
flavors
to
my
palate
overall
i
got
this
in
a
trade
from
tprokop7
i
really
enjoyed
this
very
good
tasting
beer
i
really
wish
i
could
getit
around
my
area
d
well
crafted
raspberry
strong
that
reminds
me
of
blushing
monk
a
glass
is
nice
but
a
whole
bomber
gets
to
be
too
much
drinkability
not
really
a
barleywine
despite
the
label
strong
ale
is
the
appropriate
classification
the
alcohol
is
reasonably
hidden
but
creeps
up
not
in
love
with
the
beer
but
i
respect
the
crafting
of
the
recipe
poured
into
a
tulip
a
very
nice
golden
amber
color
very
nice
carbonation
very
nice
onefinger
creamy
offwhite
head
lots
of
nice
thick
sticky
lacing
follows
the
nose
is
sweet
malty
nice
touch
of
raspberry
and
caramel
the
taste
is
sweet
malty
some
raspberry
going
on
with
some
caramel
medium
body
this
is
a
very
tasty
asa
the
alcohol
is
hidden
very
well
very
drinkable
a
pleasure
drinking
this
one
highly
recommended
thanks
andrew
the
pour
produced
a
medium
offwhite
head
with
decent
retention
the
color
was
deep
amber
with
nequality
clarity
the
nose
was
very
sweet
with
a
trix
or
other
fruity
cereallike
flavor
the
mouthfeel
was
mediumtofull
with
a
definite
raspberry
sweetness
on
the
tongue
the
finish
was
more
sour
than
sweet
more
in
keeping
with
the
flavor
that
i
have
come
to
associate
with
the
addition
of
raspberries
in
beer
barleywine
though
man
the
alcohol
was
wellhidden
22
oz
bomber
the
appearance
was
fantastic
murky
dark
red
with
some
patchy
lacing
from
a
thick
head
the
aroma
was
weaker
than
i
thought
it
would
be
faint
raspberries
but
mostly
some
good
yeast
malt
alcohol
the
taste
however
definitely
smacked
of
some
authentic
raspberry
flavors
i
was
quite
surprised
by
the
light
creamyness
of
the
beverage
this
mouthfeel
definitely
helped
the
flavors
of
raspberry
stronger
and
more
desertlike
however
it
was
a
light
enough
ale
to
just
casually
drink
with
a
medium
carbonation
overall
an
awesome
drink
from
bbc
thicksyrupy
like
a
liquid
dessert
just
too
much
raspberry
tastes
for
me
i
like
beers
with
fruits
to
be
more
subtle
glad
i
split
this
one
with
the
wvbeergeek
he
felt
the
same
about
this
beer
thanks
anyway
for
my
good
beer
buddy
sudsdog
for
the
send
have
really
enjoyed
all
the
berkshire
beers
ive
tried
previouslythis
was
the
only
dissapointment
so
far
hope
its
the
lasti
really
enjoyed
all
the
other
beers
ive
tried
from
this
brewery
and
intend
to
try
many
more
from
them
just
wish
there
beers
were
avalible
in
my
area
drinkability
is
pretty
good
for
what
it
is
too
sweet
to
drink
more
than
a
glass
but
i
would
never
mind
having
this
out
on
the
deck
after
grilling
this
one
is
a
pleasant
surprise
i
did
not
know
what
to
expect
from
this
but
expected
good
stuff
from
the
bbc
guys
i
will
revisit
this
in
6
months
or
so
to
see
how
it
develops
i
think
the
hops
need
to
mellow
just
a
bit
to
allow
the
fruit
to
develop
more
complexity
as
it
appears
to
stand
in
its
way
i
liked
it
thanks
pete
drinks
fantastic
for
a
9
abv
fruit
beer
but
not
a
style
i
go
crazy
about
a
nice
change
of
pace
nightcapdessert
beer
the
warming
booze
will
sneak
up
on
ya
drinkability
great
drinkability
another
winner
from
berkshire
brewing
company
the
taste
is
robust
with
sharp
raspberry
flavors
dominating
and
a
hint
of
malt
background
theres
an
acidic
aftertaste
i
dont
like
it
may
be
earthy
hops
or
just
some
raspberry
funk
im
not
sure
still
a
good
tasting
beer
if
a
bit
cloying
after
a
while
i
do
wish
the
mouthfeel
was
thicker
served
in
my
dfh
snifter
labeled
as
raspberry
barleywine
style
ale
poured
a
cloudy
translucent
pomegranate
color
halfinch
white
head
with
large
ringlets
that
quickly
subsided
into
light
swirls
of
oily
white
perimeter
of
lacing
surrounded
the
bowl
of
the
glass
during
the
tasting
cloyingly
sweet
nose
of
raspberry
and
alcohol
with
a
malty
character
in
the
background
taste
similar
to
nose
with
a
the
addition
of
a
caramelbuttery
flavor
however
raspberry
flavor
is
more
on
the
tart
side
in
the
mouth
some
light
carbonation
present
but
mouthfeel
is
somewhere
between
syrupy
and
oily
with
a
pleasant
warming
feeling
in
the
back
of
the
throat
at
the
finish
definitely
a
sipper
alcohol
is
fairly
wellhidden
but
i
can
see
this
one
catching
up
to
you
quickly
semislick
mouthfeel
moderate
carbonation
a
bit
syrupy
tannic
and
powdery
finish
rides
along
with
the
bitterness
not
my
favorite
from
this
brewer
the
bitter
and
tannic
finish
kept
me
from
finishing
the
bottle
pours
a
clear
amber
with
red
hues
containing
12
inch
of
soft
cream
colored
head
good
retention
and
great
lacing
smells
of
toasted
malt
honey
a
hint
of
vanilla
lots
of
raspberry
tartness
and
some
citrus
notes
with
alcohol
burn
the
taste
of
caramel
sweetness
is
quickly
overtaken
by
a
tart
raspberry
dominance
and
a
strong
alcohol
presence
some
citrus
notes
like
grapefruit
peek
thru
a
bit
as
well
as
a
hint
of
toffee
with
a
citrus
rind
finish
but
they
are
mostly
overshadowed
by
more
raspberry
flavor
medium
in
body
good
carbonation
creamy
and
tart
with
an
alcohol
burn
a
little
too
much
offering
of
raspberry
and
alcohol
reminds
me
of
cough
syrup
and
overtakes
the
other
flavors
offered
another
interesting
and
good
offering
from
berkshire
whose
bombers
are
becoming
a
staple
in
my
fridge
cant
wait
to
try
another
interesting
style
mouthfeel
is
very
light
if
it
wasnt
for
the
alcohol
presence
which
isnt
all
that
strong
it
would
be
a
very
easy
to
drink
beer
poured
a
newer
version
barleywine
syle
ale
into
two
stemmed
tulip
glasses
there
is
no
better
word
to
describe
the
color
that
raspberry
red
there
was
a
fluffy
head
that
faded
quickly
and
a
fizzy
carbonation
to
it
the
smell
didnt
blow
me
away
a
hint
of
tart
fruit
on
the
nose
the
taste
was
what
confused
me
the
most
let
me
say
first
it
tasted
good
but
with
that
said
i
dont
know
if
i
was
drinking
a
barleywine
or
a
strong
ale
the
powerful
fruit
flavor
overshadowed
any
normal
nuances
that
you
taste
from
a
barleywine
i
guess
that
if
i
knew
it
was
more
of
a
strong
raspberry
ale
then
i
would
not
have
been
so
thrown
off
bbc
has
made
a
good
beer
but
not
a
great
barleywine
way
too
fruity
for
my
liking
a
very
odd
barleywine
comparatively
to
almost
all
other
barleywines
pleasant
not
my
favorite
stylistically
but
probably
the
lightest
version
of
the
style
ive
ever
had
pours
an
interestingly
pinkred
color
with
a
pink
head
that
is
pretty
light
but
has
a
little
lacing
down
the
glass
it
has
a
strong
raspberry
aroma
and
i
couldnt
really
detect
much
else
except
some
malts
the
taste
was
good
a
nice
malty
backbone
with
some
hops
for
a
good
strong
ale
with
a
really
good
kick
of
raspberries
that
makes
it
a
very
refreshing
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
good
very
crisp
and
the
drinkability
is
very
good
as
well
final
thought
barleywine
really
i
like
barleywines
but
i
dont
know
if
i
would
call
this
one
perhaps
it
resembles
an
english
barley
wine
in
its
strength
and
malt
character
but
it
doesnt
have
the
hops
or
the
alchohol
presence
to
fall
into
the
american
version
of
that
category
at
least
in
my
admittedly
notsohumble
opinion
ill
check
out
the
bbc
website
and
see
if
the
brewers
having
anything
to
say
about
it
i
think
the
former
classification
of
strong
ale
is
perfectly
fitting
for
this
beer
pours
a
clear
ruby
with
a
slight
amount
of
light
tan
head
nose
is
like
syrupy
chewing
gum
and
raspberries
too
of
course
the
flavor
carries
a
sweet
and
even
raspberry
flavor
that
is
firm
but
not
overpowering
by
any
means
but
the
fruit
doesnt
stay
as
the
only
definition
of
the
brew
feel
is
syrupy
on
the
tongue
with
a
decent
level
of
bubble
hitting
you
as
well
i
love
the
fruit
beers
and
think
this
one
is
spot
on
very
much
worth
trying
and
i
am
glad
i
brought
this
one
back
from
my
trip
to
boston
d
a
little
tasty
goes
down
easily
good
kick
not
too
filling
although
its
my
least
favorite
beer
from
berkshire
brewing
co
its
not
because
its
a
bad
beer
i
think
its
very
wellcrafted
im
just
not
a
fan
of
the
raspberry
flavor
however
if
you
do
like
that
kind
of
flavor
then
is
an
excellent
beer
for
you
if
youre
looking
for
something
dominated
by
a
fruit
taste
and
aroma
a
lambic
would
make
a
much
better
choice
d
for
being
9
this
one
is
quite
the
drinker
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
a
nice
reddish
brown
with
a
thick
foamy
head
the
head
disappeared
quickly
but
left
lacings
down
the
whole
beer
with
slight
foam
left
on
the
top
aroma
had
raspberry
but
also
has
definate
alcohol
aromas
taste
was
reasonable
could
pick
up
the
berry
with
slight
sweetness
left
some
bitterness
on
the
tounge
at
the
back
end
of
the
sip
along
with
some
tingling
tingling
was
interesting
in
the
mouth
but
didnt
detract
too
much
but
the
stickinesssweetness
kinda
hit
it
a
little
strong
beer
so
not
something
to
rush
but
nice
to
drink
this
is
a
very
different
beer
a
fruit
beer
that
hits
like
an
ris
or
dipa
i
really
like
this
beer
and
love
this
brewery
bbc
is
so
good
that
it
is
my
go
to
brewery
from
bjohnson
for
my
bombing
nice
looking
brew
as
it
pours
to
a
reddish
color
with
a
light
tan
head
that
has
some
good
retention
and
left
some
lacing
down
the
side
of
the
glass
the
aroma
definitely
is
of
fruit
but
not
sure
if
it
clearly
comes
across
as
raspberry
but
regardless
it
is
a
nice
scent
also
you
are
able
to
pick
up
a
malt
and
alcohol
scent
that
mixes
nicely
the
taste
is
extremely
smooth
with
a
creamy
texture
has
a
nice
sweet
flavor
that
breaks
to
a
tart
finish
which
is
very
good
and
different
from
most
fruit
beers
i
have
had
in
the
past
i
am
not
picking
up
much
of
any
hops
but
i
would
imagine
that
they
are
there
just
hidden
as
the
brew
warms
the
alcohol
becomes
more
evident
but
goes
nice
with
the
other
tastes
i
think
i
would
get
a
little
tired
of
this
brew
if
it
came
in
a
larger
offering
than
the
22
oz
which
would
be
crazy
but
is
why
i
am
giving
a
little
lower
rating
on
the
drink
ability
this
is
another
excellent
brew
from
bbc
not
the
normal
offering
i
would
get
but
now
that
i
have
had
it
i
would
get
it
again
and
recommend
it
d
an
intriguing
if
not
particularly
drinkable
beer
raspberry
flavor
is
laid
on
pretty
thick
could
be
a
little
better
balanced
what
a
surprise
i
was
expecting
your
typical
wheat
beer
with
a
bunch
of
fruit
flavoring
dumped
in
post
fermentation
as
is
the
case
with
many
of
the
flavor
added
fruity
ales
this
one
is
different
the
color
is
quite
reddish
and
enticing
it
doesnt
have
much
of
a
head
and
very
little
carbonation
this
is
a
strong
beer
with
an
alcoholy
warmth
to
it
slightly
like
a
liqueur
in
mouthfeel
the
taste
is
smooth
a
little
on
the
syrupy
side
with
plenty
of
good
ole
raspberries
there
isnt
much
of
a
hoppy
bite
at
all
which
is
good
because
it
would
have
diminished
this
ale
and
what
it
is
trying
to
do
the
back
end
is
where
the
alcohol
lingers
the
most
and
where
it
is
most
pronounced
this
is
a
strong
ale
at
9
abv
but
it
doesnt
taste
quite
that
strong
because
the
complexity
of
the
elements
masks
the
strength
to
a
point
but
only
to
a
point
it
comes
through
as
mentioned
on
the
back
end
this
is
a
very
nice
ale
a
pleasant
surprise
and
one
worth
coming
back
to
especially
when
some
warmth
is
needed
lchaim
poured
into
a
standard
pint
glass
a
nice
deep
red
ale
with
a
tanpinkish
head
about
1
5
that
dies
out
soon
after
pouring
the
smell
is
very
good
aromas
of
raspberries
and
malt
not
much
trace
of
alcohol
in
the
smell
taste
is
exceptional
very
sweet
and
malty
if
i
didnt
know
this
was
a
9
beer
i
would
have
never
got
that
from
the
taste
the
sweetness
and
fruit
overpowers
the
alcohol
feels
very
smooth
in
mouth
not
too
much
carbonation
very
good
drinkability
i
could
definately
drink
several
of
these
in
a
night
oours
a
clear
deep
dark
red
with
a
smallish
tan
sudsey
head
no
lacingbut
still
a
decent
looking
brew
the
smell
is
very
pungent
with
a
bisquity
aroma
along
with
alcohol
raspberries
and
sweet
malt
the
taste
is
very
strong
with
raspberrieschocolatealcohol
and
bread
yeast
this
is
a
very
sweet
beer
the
mf
is
light
and
the
alcohol
is
pretty
well
hiddenyet
all
the
flavors
mix
well
this
is
a
very
good
beermaybe
a
little
sweet
for
my
tastebut
if
you
enjoy
chocolate
and
fruit
this
may
be
your
beer
very
smooth
and
a
joy
to
drink
the
best
example
of
a
fruit
beer
i
am
yet
to
try
i
dont
usually
like
fruit
beers
but
i
loved
this
one
this
beer
could
have
gone
wrong
in
many
ways
but
instead
is
balanced
cohesive
and
very
drinkable
this
is
a
bold
risky
beer
and
berkshire
pulled
it
off
well
im
looking
forward
to
having
another
and
im
thinking
of
getting
some
to
cellar
for
a
year
as
well
d
this
was
great
for
a
fruit
beer
mainly
because
the
raspberries
did
not
whelm
the
palate
very
drinkable
though
perhaps
not
more
than
a
couple
pints
in
a
night
would
definitely
try
again
on
a
cold
wintery
night
not
a
fan
of
fruit
beers
but
this
is
a
decent
drop
it
sneaks
up
on
you
with
it
being
9
and
when
punters
order
a
large
22oz
at
the
bar
they
may
as
well
just
down
a
bottle
of
vino
but
this
beer
is
solid
and
worth
a
shot
ive
only
ever
had
it
on
tap
and
it
always
pours
well
it
is
dark
heavy
bold
and
perfect
to
sup
on
a
new
england
february
night
22
oz
bottle
poured
in
a
pint
glass
with
the
beta
band
on
the
hifi
too
bad
beta
band
called
it
quits
i
enjoyed
their
work
ok
to
the
beer
dark
reddish
pink
color
with
head
that
receeds
real
fast
smells
of
raspberry
citrus
tart
taste
with
no
lacing
on
the
glass
second
gulp
and
now
my
mouth
is
filled
with
berry
flavor
taste
mouthfeel
are
good
but
not
as
sweet
as
i
thought
it
would
be
dry
sharp
feeling
in
my
mouth
which
is
pleasant
this
however
will
not
take
the
place
of
my
favorites
from
bbc
which
are
the
coffeehouse
porter
and
cabin
fever
i
was
delighted
to
see
this
in
a
liquor
store
near
me
as
it
has
been
a
while
since
i
can
remember
seeing
it
around
as
i
recall
with
the
exception
of
the
coffeehouse
porter
this
was
the
first
berkshire
beer
i
tried
back
in
the
dizzle
it
poured
a
really
lovely
pinkish
color
unlike
anything
i
have
seen
in
the
recent
past
minimal
head
on
this
one
but
a
nice
white
lace
to
compensate
as
it
warmed
smells
of
tart
rasberries
showed
up
as
well
as
some
other
mild
berry
aromas
taste
was
on
par
with
the
tart
rasberry
aspect
but
there
was
a
slight
problem
another
reviewer
had
mentioned
that
the
alcohol
was
too
much
i
whole
heartedly
agree
sometimes
that
syrupy
sweet
alcohol
flavor
can
simply
become
too
much
to
handle
that
was
the
main
thing
that
dragged
this
beer
down
a
bit
in
my
book
it
was
not
too
heavy
but
the
alcohol
could
have
been
a
bit
more
well
hidden
one
22oz
was
more
then
enough
for
me
having
said
that
this
is
still
by
no
means
a
beer
to
skip
im
surfe
many
would
enjoy
it
quite
a
bit
this
being
my
third
time
sampling
this
brew
i
would
probably
say
that
i
will
get
it
again
before
it
goes
on
hiatus
bottom
line
is
that
this
beer
is
one
of
the
better
fruit
beers
in
the
new
england
area
right
up
there
with
9
and
some
of
the
boston
beer
works
fruit
beers
cheers
overall
very
nice
unique
and
good
it
could
be
considered
as
an
after
dinner
drink
and
at
9
abv
as
it
is
quite
strong
the
alcohol
content
is
hidden
quite
well
i
enjoyed
this
bomber
until
the
last
drop
i
am
glad
i
purchased
a
few
of
them
this
beer
is
a
great
example
of
creating
balanced
flavor
with
an
almost
always
overpowering
fruit
well
done
i
would
recommend
for
anyone
to
give
this
sweet
raspberry
strong
ale
a
try
drinkability
it
is
very
drinkable
however
i
think
it
is
only
really
enjoyed
as
an
after
dinner
drink
because
it
is
very
dessert
like
i
could
not
session
on
this
beer
drinkability
i
found
this
quite
drinkable
for
the
high
alcohol
content
and
could
have
gone
through
another
bomber
if
i
had
one
available
overall
unique
interesting
beer
that
is
recommended
for
fans
of
strong
ales
i
just
dont
think
i
can
handle
these
anymore
yes
im
a
wimp
when
considering
drinkability
i
often
ask
myself
if
i
would
look
forward
to
having
it
again
and
a
good
sign
is
as
soon
as
you
finish
the
drink
you
look
forward
to
the
next
time
you
might
have
one
sadly
this
is
a
seasonal
brew
from
a
small
brewer
on
the
other
side
of
the
country
so
its
unlikely
that
ill
ever
have
one
of
these
again
if
youre
new
england
during
raspberry
ale
season
im
guessing
fall
make
it
a
point
to
seek
out
this
marvel
pours
a
reddish
brown
it
is
very
dark
with
no
light
coming
through
leaving
a
1in
thick
tanred
tint
in
the
head
the
inital
smell
is
raspberry
alcohal
wheat
sugar
no
real
hop
presence
to
be
found
starts
on
the
palate
a
carbonated
raspberry
juice
as
it
sits
on
the
palate
the
alcohal
is
really
present
there
is
a
slgiht
bitter
hop
feel
on
the
palate
that
finishes
rough
like
a
spirit
decent
strong
ale
could
use
some
more
aging
to
mellow
out
a
bit
flavor
starts
with
a
bit
of
caramel
and
then
the
tart
berries
take
over
i
get
sweettart
raspberry
flavor
on
the
sides
of
my
tongue
from
mid
swallow
through
finish
the
carbonation
actually
leaves
a
bit
of
a
tingle
as
well
with
quite
fizzy
state
the
flavor
doesnt
allow
any
hop
presence
and
is
fairly
sweet
overall
i
do
get
a
bit
of
warm
alcohol
on
the
finish
the
beer
is
interesting
and
i
like
the
sweetness
but
i
think
raspberry
goes
better
with
a
stout
and
some
chocolate
notes
worth
a
shot
but
not
excellent
hard
to
say
much
about
this
beer
as
its
name
suggests
raspberries
dominate
and
its
strong
its
well
balanced
and
enjoyable
perhaps
a
bomber
sometime
in
the
future
will
be
in
the
fridge
beer
is
good
happy
cherry
beering
in
this
case
its
fragrant
chippy
nutty
and
woody
its
pretty
nice
for
a
bottled
beer
of
this
style
fairly
small
brewery
too
ive
heard
some
mixed
reviews
about
bbc
recentlyi
wont
let
them
affect
my
judgement
thumbs
up
for
sure
ive
gotta
say
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
is
pretty
remarkable
this
bomber
was
among
the
fastest
ive
ever
consumed
i
could
almost
gulp
this
like
a
softdrink
very
refreshing
and
thirst
quenching
quite
a
feat
for
a
9
abv
beer
nice
even
better
on
tap
overall
very
different
from
most
of
berkshires
brews
which
tend
to
be
smooth
and
sweet
at
least
all
of
the
ones
that
i
have
had
so
far
highly
recommended
i
spent
the
summer
dinking
as
much
of
this
stuff
as
i
could
find
and
store
this
is
a
truly
wonderful
local
offering
after
visiting
the
brewery
and
seeing
how
it
was
made
the
clarity
was
impressive
the
taste
and
aroma
were
among
the
best
i
have
sampled
from
bbc
although
it
was
a
little
fizzer
than
i
like
in
a
beer
it
did
go
down
nice
in
the
heat
i
have
one
bottle
left
in
the
fridge
and
it
will
likely
not
make
it
through
the
night
bam
raspberry
tarty
kick
thats
what
this
beer
is
all
about
poured
a
garnetrubyish
red
in
color
no
head
and
flat
appearance
nose
is
all
raspberries
as
i
drink
this
i
wonder
if
i
could
work
this
into
my
ice
cream
flavor
is
all
raspberry
tartness
with
just
a
slight
malty
sweetness
around
the
finish
after
a
while
i
found
my
tongue
starting
to
pucker
that
was
why
i
find
this
beer
so
low
in
terms
of
drinkability
all
the
tartness
just
wears
out
the
taste
buds
but
it
is
really
raspberry
in
that
fruity
sweet
type
of
way
mouthfeel
is
very
light
and
there
is
a
bit
of
a
fruity
stickiness
going
on
22oz
bomber
reddish
body
with
a
light
tan
foamy
head
that
leaves
thin
webbings
of
lace
around
the
glass
interesting
aroma
that
is
full
of
raspberries
and
has
a
fairly
strong
sourness
to
it
there
is
some
sweet
malt
as
well
other
subtleties
going
on
i
was
expecting
more
of
an
ale
with
some
raspberries
but
this
seems
dominated
by
raspberry
tartness
flavor
kicks
off
with
more
of
the
raspberries
and
a
nice
tart
bite
some
caramel
malt
sweetness
is
there
but
definitely
taking
a
back
seat
other
light
fruit
notes
mingle
about
ends
with
a
sour
bite
over
some
raspberries
solid
mouthfeel
that
fits
it
well
very
drinkable
stuff
to
me
as
well
i
was
in
the
mood
for
a
sour
beer
at
the
time
but
this
hit
the
spot
any
way
very
interesting
tasty
offering
here
i
really
liked
this
one
and
cant
believe
i
had
never
seen
it
before
appearance
wise
id
have
to
call
it
garnet
in
a
glass
the
thick
white
foam
did
disapear
quickly
aroma
was
of
fresh
raspberries
tastewise
starts
off
with
a
spritz
of
raspberry
and
then
you
get
into
some
serious
maltiness
the
alcohol
does
rear
its
head
at
the
end
of
very
sip
though
overall
this
is
a
very
smooth
easy
drinking
fruit
beer
that
said
i
cant
say
that
this
is
one
that
i
would
either
stock
regularly
or
try
again
this
is
yet
another
fine
and
very
drinkable
bbc
product
i
can
hardly
wait
to
sample
the
other
bbc
bombers
laying
up
in
the
beer
only
fridge
pours
dark
ruby
with
a
little
creamy
head
good
carbonation
smells
of
heavy
malts
alcohol
caramels
and
hints
of
sweetsour
raspberries
in
the
nose
taste
follows
well
with
a
very
thick
maltiness
astringent
alcohol
and
raspberries
at
first
the
berries
seem
to
be
almost
fake
only
becoming
noticeable
at
the
end
of
each
sip
but
as
the
brew
warmed
up
a
little
the
initial
flavors
melanged
so
that
i
could
taste
the
raspberries
throughout
although
quite
strong
in
taste
and
in
octane
it
is
a
very
good
beer
that
i
would
have
again
encircling
handcuff
of
carbonation
that
tames
the
ale
sparkling
red
hue
with
some
gentle
haze
and
almost
mute
hic
sweetness
to
nose
with
a
fruity
malt
thickness
noted
flippant
juice
raspberry
slime
on
mouth
just
throttling
and
then
a
rank
tart
shot
hits
with
the
alcohol
fumes
watering
the
eyes
a
bit
sticky
mouthfeel
and
far
too
rapberryey
for
my
tastes
poured
a
dark
strawberry
thin
head
that
left
a
collar
all
the
way
down
smell
was
fruity
could
detect
the
rasberry
aroma
taste
is
complex
rasberry
evident
but
also
malt
and
slight
hop
balance
mouthfeel
is
well
carbonated
and
tart
smooth
finish
this
is
a
fantastic
seasonal
that
i
look
forward
to
every
year
im
not
sure
about
the
abv
but
i
know
its
fairly
high
i
highly
recommend
trying
this
one
shaker
12oz
glass
presentation
nice
offwhite
12
head
over
an
amber
brew
with
red
highlights
and
laced
well
aroma
is
of
raspberries
but
with
an
evident
malt
support
system
taste
is
upfront
raspberry
then
the
malts
make
a
quick
guest
appearance
and
leaves
with
a
fruity
tart
bite
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
great
especially
for
the
sometimes
cloying
fruit
beer
style
i
feel
this
presentation
was
a
bit
more
sedate
and
approachable
than
the
fullon
experience
i
got
from
the
bottle
amber
brown
in
color
with
an
off
white
head
of
tiny
bubbles
that
left
very
little
lace
initially
a
realy
tart
aroma
replaced
with
heavy
malt
and
fruity
yeast
aromas
and
a
slight
ketchup
like
odor
and
the
faintest
of
barnyard
aroma
there
is
a
nice
heavy
malt
flavor
here
with
a
good
balance
of
sweet
malt
and
tart
yeast
that
provides
good
body
to
go
with
the
carbonation
i
really
like
the
subdued
nature
of
the
raspberries
its
a
nice
change
from
the
pink
beers
you
can
find
out
there
that
bury
any
other
flavors
with
fruit
juice
this
is
well
done
in
the
belgian
style
but
drinkabilitywise
i
think
it
would
be
tough
to
drink
this
on
a
regular
basis
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
fruit
beer
movement
but
this
brew
was
recommended
while
i
was
on
the
bbc
brewery
tour
i
gave
it
a
shot
and
thoroughly
enjoyed
a
fruit
beer
that
combined
the
interesting
characteristics
of
a
strong
dark
ale
with
subtle
but
significant
raspberry
flavors
the
only
comparison
i
can
think
of
is
three
philosophers
and
this
brew
blues
that
blend
out
of
the
water
it
has
a
blackbrown
appearance
with
a
fair
head
the
aroma
is
dominated
by
malt
and
raspberry
there
are
hints
of
chocolate
to
keep
me
interested
the
flavor
profile
is
more
complex
while
raspberry
notes
pop
up
occasionally
and
dominate
the
finish
there
is
a
significant
coffee
and
chocolate
presence
in
addition
to
some
funkier
sour
notes
the
brew
is
well
bodied
and
quite
drinkable
given
its
alcohol
content
small
head
dark
brown
amber
color
the
smell
of
yeast
and
slight
raspberry
fruit
the
flavor
is
of
strong
alcohol
throughout
with
a
kick
of
raspberry
at
the
end
the
drinkability
is
average
it
depends
of
how
well
you
handle
a
strong
alcohol
flavor
for
me
a
22
oz
bomber
is
just
enough
before
i
want
to
move
on
to
something
else
this
strong
ale
is
full
bodied
and
is
lightly
carbonated
there
is
a
lot
of
residual
sugar
that
leaves
a
thin
coating
on
the
palate
as
powerful
as
the
raspberries
are
in
the
beginning
they
become
much
less
pronounced
as
i
continue
to
sample
this
brew
sitting
in
my
duvel
glass
it
looks
very
nice
a
dark
brown
with
hints
of
purple
or
red
depending
on
how
close
to
the
light
you
hold
it
small
light
khacki
colored
head
which
unleashes
a
raspberry
and
alcohol
smell
the
taste
jsut
after
it
is
poured
is
a
bit
harsh
which
starts
with
a
lsightly
alcohol
taste
and
a
soft
raspberry
aftertastye
as
it
warms
the
raspberry
comes
out
upfront
but
still
with
a
twinge
of
alcohol
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
and
throat
a
bit
to
agressive
early
on
but
it
mellows
but
still
not
easily
drinkable
there
are
a
bit
of
whiskey
taste
and
burn
in
there
that
makes
it
harsh
i
didnt
enjoy
this
one
but
it
might
be
the
style
or
the
fact
i
dont
care
much
for
fruit
beers
worth
trying
but
not
something
i
would
buy
again
especially
in
the
spring
maybe
a
nice
cold
winter
day
beer
to
warm
you
up
pours
almost
black
with
a
hint
of
purple
raspberry
smell
hints
of
raspberry
and
chocolate
the
fruit
is
upfront
upon
taste
but
not
overwhelmingling
so
very
smooth
no
evidence
of
the
9
this
brewery
consistently
produces
topshelf
products
while
not
compromising
their
local
flavor
i
dont
normally
enjoy
fruit
flavored
beers
but
i
found
myself
travelling
to
mass
more
than
once
to
purchase
this
beer
ill
admit
that
not
being
a
huge
fan
of
fruit
flavored
beers
i
was
a
bit
skeptical
but
i
think
bbc
hit
a
home
run
with
this
one
the
raspberry
strong
ale
is
not
just
a
fruity
beer
it
is
a
well
crafted
and
balanced
ale
pours
from
the
bottle
with
a
definite
reddish
tinge
and
just
a
bit
of
off
white
head
good
carbonation
evident
however
aroma
is
very
full
of
fresh
raspberries
nothing
artificial
here
taste
is
initially
sweet
and
the
raspberry
is
quite
pronounced
but
theres
a
lot
to
back
it
up
plenty
of
caramely
malt
comes
in
towards
the
middle
and
a
good
hop
bitterness
manages
to
make
itself
known
as
well
through
the
finish
alcohol
is
definitely
noticeable
but
not
harsh
at
all
very
good
effort
from
bbc
wish
we
had
picke
dup
more
than
1
bottle
great
raspberry
aroma
with
similar
coloring
nor
much
of
a
head
but
flavor
makes
up
for
it
initial
sweetness
definite
raspberry
presence
alcohol
presence
is
there
but
definitely
not
overwhelming
mouthfeel
was
an
extremely
pleasant
experience
the
initially
round
and
sweet
feel
mellowed
into
a
slightly
tart
mid
palate
feel
and
ended
in
a
dry
dry
waft
of
lightly
alcohol
finish
this
brew
reminded
me
a
barleywine
without
the
extreme
kick
of
alcohol
definite
winelike
notes
throughout
the
experience
especially
the
dry
finish
very
drinkable
for
the
abv
as
i
am
having
a
22
oz
bomber
i
think
that
is
sufficient
for
one
sitting
but
i
will
definitely
try
again
i
had
this
beer
at
about
11
am
while
the
palate
was
extremely
fresh
what
a
treat
the
foam
on
the
head
dissapates
quickly
leaving
a
cloudy
amber
beer
with
no
head
sitting
in
front
of
you
but
wait
what
is
that
heavenly
aroma
rising
from
the
glass
a
strong
scent
on
razzberry
with
a
tantilizing
hint
of
alcohol
teases
your
nose
and
starts
you
salivating
the
taste
of
razzberries
gently
fills
your
mouth
and
finishes
with
a
welcoming
warm
alcohol
glow
i
picked
this
up
over
a
month
ago
i
belive
this
is
not
a
fall
or
winter
seasonal
but
a
summer
special
with
its
delicious
kick
it
should
be
a
fall
or
winter
favorite
i
wrote
this
review
while
finishing
the
last
of
the
22
oz
bottle
this
was
great
makes
an
excellent
winter
warmer
surprisingly
and
dangerously
drinkable
pours
with
a
good
head
doesnt
leave
much
of
a
lace
strong
raspberry
nose
slightly
syrupy
cloudy
brown
red
color
with
a
lot
of
chunky
bits
settling
to
the
bottom
could
be
raspberry
seeds
good
favor
sweet
raspberry
but
this
is
no
session
beer
the
abv
will
sneak
up
on
you
appearance
of
a
dark
iced
tea
color
is
a
dark
brown
with
a
reddish
hue
aroma
is
extremely
strong
of
raspberries
and
fruit
very
sweet
aroma
small
white
and
thin
creamy
white
head
lace
doesnt
cling
that
long
to
the
glass
the
first
sip
is
almost
overwhelming
it
tastes
like
cough
syrup
extremely
strong
with
a
harsh
mouthfeel
im
sad
to
say
i
didnt
like
this
the
smell
and
appearance
looked
and
smelled
great
bbc
did
a
great
job
as
far
as
raspberry
flavor
is
concernedbut
its
just
too
much
its
hard
to
swallow
medium
to
almost
full
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
creamy
rolling
texture
some
people
like
it
and
some
dont
i
guess
about
time
someone
brewed
a
fruit
beer
with
strength
this
is
no
sissy
fruit
beer
you
are
probably
used
to
todd
was
spot
on
with
the
cordial
comment
this
is
an
ale
to
reckon
with
notes
a
massively
complex
and
tasty
beers
raspberry
flavours
border
overwhelming
and
contrived
but
once
the
alcohol
works
its
way
into
your
head
you
wont
care
all
hail
berkshire
brewing
co
hoist
one
up
i
love
this
freagin
brewery
or
is
that
the
alcohol
speaking
this
mediumfull
bodied
strong
ale
presents
with
a
deep
dark
amber
color
and
a
sweet
malty
aroma
with
just
a
hint
of
raspberry
the
heavier
body
of
this
ale
is
perfect
to
compliment
the
sweetness
of
the
malts
and
levels
the
usual
harshness
of
vary
alcoholic
beers
given
that
this
brew
is
only
available
in
22
oz
bottles
on
better
be
a
hearty
soul
or
have
a
good
friend
to
share
it
with
this
just
isnt
beer
way
too
much
this
is
just
perfection
if
you
like
cordiallike
flavors
from
the
deep
ruby
hue
to
the
warm
inviting
smell
next
to
the
way
it
just
coats
your
mouth
with
deep
dark
fruit
flavors
i
just
cant
get
enough
of
this
beer
a
steep
price
yes
but
small
pours
and
the
look
it
brings
to
peoples
faces
when
you
break
it
out
make
it
a
worthy
investment
10th
anniversary
edition
2012
only
had
a
few
ounces
but
it
was
more
than
enough
rich
and
sweet
with
boozy
dark
fruits
and
figs
drank
like
a
brandy
or
dessert
liquor
very
nice
though
unlike
any
other
beer
ive
tried
amazingly
complex
i
felt
as
if
i
was
drinking
a
brandy
very
smooth
and
very
strong
one
of
the
best
beers
but
paired
with
a
high
price
tag
the
body
is
viscous
and
thick
and
the
alcohol
is
at
29
yet
this
is
incredibly
pleasant
to
drink
much
more
than
any
spirit
that
i
have
tried
not
even
sure
howwhy
this
is
a
beer
i
wouldnt
drink
this
if
it
came
in
8
6packs
forget
the
insane
price
it
sells
for
slightly
lighter
caramel
coloring
but
still
rich
has
a
sherryamarone
type
nose
and
has
a
rich
taste
that
for
its
abv
is
remarkably
balanced
im
not
positive
if
this
is
the
best
beer
i
have
ever
had
but
nothing
else
comes
to
mind
totally
worth
the
search
for
it
i
am
new
2
all
this
but
ive
had
some
good
stuff
and
by
far
i
think
this
is
the
best
of
what
ive
had
so
far
it
looks
cool
smells
great
and
goes
down
easy
just
like
i
like
it
overall
4
5
what
can
i
say
about
this
beer
prior
to
having
it
its
one
of
those
beers
that
its
easy
to
remain
aloof
aboutthe
price
point
is
so
over
the
top
that
thoughts
of
how
good
could
it
really
be
come
naturally
ive
always
wanted
to
try
itmostly
for
the
novelty
of
a
30
beerbut
also
recognized
that
it
would
surprise
me
if
the
opportunity
never
presented
itself
given
that
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
procure
a
bottle
and
probably
would
balk
at
the
cost
if
one
ever
crossed
my
path
now
that
ive
had
it
i
can
honestly
say
that
i
would
actually
have
to
talk
myself
out
of
buying
a
bottle
if
i
came
across
one
and
that
in
spite
of
its
high
rating
on
ba
i
think
it
might
actually
be
underrated
its
just
an
amazingly
welldone
and
envelopepushing
beer
fine
sherry
with
nutty
notes
lite
syrup
an
exceptional
beer
and
worth
the
hype
this
beer
is
a
definite
experience
and
im
stoked
to
have
had
the
opportunity
to
try
something
i
wouldnt
have
bought
for
myself
its
an
incredibly
smooth
beer
at
that
high
of
an
abv
that
is
surprisingly
drinkable
and
to
me
tastes
like
a
world
class
barley
wine
that
had
been
age
in
bourbon
barrels
but
the
bourbon
flavor
faded
away
wow
strong
but
magnificent
split
the
cost
of
this
with
2
other
guys
and
we
are
sipping
it
over
the
next
6
months
as
it
is
waaaayyy
strong
this
stuff
is
not
beer
its
liquor
very
strong
on
the
first
sip
it
cools
down
after
a
few
sips
but
that
might
be
because
your
drunk
this
is
an
interesting
experience
not
all
i
hoped
for
though
cannot
taste
the
alcohol
but
it
is
there
had
this
at
the
2012
gabf
i
bought
this
beer
several
years
ago
and
opened
it
on
my
30th
b
day
very
complex
with
layers
of
flavor
hats
off
to
the
vision
they
had
to
age
a
beer
18
years
i
really
enjoyed
it
the
question
is
is
it
worth
the
200
and
my
answer
is
going
to
be
absolutely
yes
if
you
understandably
cant
afford
the
decanter
try
a
20
two
ounce
pour
at
a
bar
frankly
that
might
be
the
best
way
to
try
it
if
you
do
get
the
decanter
its
got
to
be
something
you
share
it
has
to
be
conversational
a
sign
of
what
great
things
beer
can
be
at
one
of
its
outliers
overall
this
is
a
must
try
and
for
me
lives
up
to
the
hype
its
just
a
sipper
so
your
2oz
pours
sould
last
a
while
had
it
for
the
first
time
at
2013
fobab
unbelievable
never
had
anything
like
it
ever
extremely
complex
a
ton
going
on
in
there
and
unbelievably
delicious
like
an
aged
120
minute
ipa
with
a
hotd
matt
and
a
bruery
bba
melange
3
and
some
cognac
tossed
in
for
good
measure
something
everyone
should
experience
at
least
once
if
not
buy
it
for
future
delights
i
was
lucky
enough
to
taste
the
most
recent
two
releases
2012
2103
side
by
side
and
i
have
to
say
that
the
addition
of
kmf
made
a
huge
difference
it
definitely
added
a
lot
of
extra
fruit
and
sour
notes
that
seemed
a
bit
more
muted
in
the
2012
its
one
of
those
brews
thats
worth
the
investment
for
any
beer
geek
out
there
if
for
no
other
reason
than
to
say
that
youve
had
it
a
coworker
of
mine
still
had
one
from
2008
and
we
tried
some
of
that
recently
the
more
vibrant
notes
in
fresher
batches
mellowed
out
giving
way
to
more
robust
bourbon
and
port
notes
overall
a
fantastic
brew
this
isnt
a
regular
beer
i
wouldnt
want
this
if
i
were
in
the
mood
for
a
beer
but
if
i
wanted
spirits
and
decided
to
crack
this
open
instead
for
a
special
occasion
this
is
deeper
and
more
complex
than
any
whiskey
or
bourbon
ive
had
straight
and
could
easily
meet
your
needs
for
that
kind
of
a
drink
despite
the
price
tag
i
can
now
easily
see
myself
buying
one
of
these
to
crack
open
on
special
occasions
or
even
for
a
special
nip
before
bed
overall
i
had
huge
expectations
for
this
but
felt
a
but
let
down
i
think
its
a
bit
too
far
over
the
line
to
a
spirit
and
lacks
what
i
truly
like
about
beer
overall
still
a
cool
thing
to
share
with
a
friend
and
a
good
experience
especially
with
an
old
triple
bock
next
to
it
glad
i
finally
got
to
try
it
but
not
sure
i
would
buy
an
entire
bottle
for
myself
smells
like
liquor
and
ends
with
a
decent
malt
finish
very
good
for
what
it
is
theres
nothing
like
it
is
it
worth
it
who
can
say
its
a
unique
masterpiece
ill
probably
never
buy
another
one
but
im
glad
i
did
it
once
massive
utopias
vertical
with
the
gang
last
weekend
followed
by
millennium
mmm
i
cant
read
my
notes
only
remember
what
vintages
stood
out
2013
with
the
little
window
in
the
bottle
was
actually
my
favorite
i
expected
to
like
the
older
ones
more
2005
and
2009
are
marked
as
the
next
best
of
course
none
of
them
held
a
candle
to
millennium
the
whole
group
agreed
with
that
flavors
were
all
big
sweet
malt
toffee
lots
of
warm
vanilla
old
tawny
port
the
2013
or
whatever
the
most
recent
bottle
was
had
more
developed
rich
flavors
and
not
as
cloying
on
the
tongue
a
good
experience
overall
an
experience
yep
probably
not
as
good
an
experience
as
a
200
meal
but
i
will
enjoy
this
many
times
over
the
coming
months
so
thats
how
ill
look
at
this
one
not
sure
if
id
buy
this
one
again
but
by
the
time
this
bottle
is
gone
im
sure
ill
know
4s
across
the
board
for
a
rating
because
its
very
interesting
quite
enjoyable
but
in
a
league
of
its
own
in
every
way
id
try
this
again
if
i
knew
it
had
been
aged
for
a
few
years
i
think
the
sweetness
would
really
be
tempered
which
would
allow
some
of
the
flavors
to
come
to
the
forefront
of
the
beer
you
know
there
has
to
be
something
pretty
wicked
about
this
beer
because
of
its
price
and
rarity
i
just
didnt
get
it
when
i
tried
it
it
tastes
kinda
like
if
you
could
make
cognac
out
of
beer
fruit
cognac
amplifies
and
embitters
the
fruit
producing
a
hyperevolved
and
lightly
burny
version
of
say
orange
juice
where
the
sweetness
hasnt
gone
away
so
much
as
its
lapped
itself
so
take
the
sweeter
pale
malt
nodes
favored
by
sam
adams
and
then
amplify
them
so
much
they
retain
only
their
barest
essence
and
the
somehow
remarkably
make
it
pleasurable
to
drink
on
the
whole
ive
really
enjoyed
trying
this
beer
it
is
totally
pushing
the
envelope
of
what
beer
can
be
i
dont
think
that
beer
culture
is
there
yet
but
maybe
this
is
where
it
is
going
very
complex
layers
of
flavor
and
aromas
and
i
love
the
craftsmanship
that
went
into
developing
this
beer
and
also
the
story
there
is
no
better
the
only
minor
negative
for
me
is
that
it
is
syrupy
and
thick
not
like
traditional
beer
at
all
i
do
get
that
this
is
stretching
the
definition
of
what
beer
is
and
i
like
that
spirit
but
i
kinda
like
beer
where
it
is
this
is
the
port
wine
version
of
beer
and
deserves
its
own
category
and
that
is
what
sam
adams
has
created
here
a
new
category
of
beer
ive
had
this
one
a
few
times
from
a
few
different
vintages
i
suppose
im
lucky
aroma
is
quite
bready
with
malty
notes
and
some
nice
spiciness
also
notes
of
brandy
and
yeast
on
the
nose
maybe
even
champagne
flavor
is
similar
but
less
boozy
than
the
nose
surprisingly
easy
to
drink
especially
considering
the
abv
but
definitely
a
strange
brew
very
interesting
a
whole
lot
of
acclimatization
is
required
to
actually
get
into
this
one
at
first
but
once
youre
past
that
initial
palate
gangbang
the
teetering
balance
of
malt
bourbon
port
rum
funk
maple
sugar
and
hops
starts
to
make
more
and
more
sense
and
thats
only
due
in
small
part
to
the
54proof
alcohol
utopias
is
one
of
the
few
endpoints
of
beer
fandom
and
is
almost
worthy
of
its
sticker
price
id
say
shelf
tag
but
heh
it
never
actually
made
it
there
around
here
my
only
real
beef
here
is
that
i
can
only
make
an
educated
guess
as
to
how
much
i
have
left
in
the
bottle
im
thinking
at
least
16oz
as
this
kind
of
thing
surely
engenders
more
writing
than
imbibing
eh
odfinally
tried
it
its
like
no
other
beer
ive
tried
clearly
worth
a
sample
but
i
would
never
even
think
to
toss
out
so
much
coin
for
a
whole
bottle
of
this
o
overall
good
although
less
than
amazing
pretty
smooth
considering
the
abv
tasty
but
not
necessarily
outstanding
however
an
awesome
experience
to
share
with
beer
buddies
this
one
is
a
real
treat
if
you
like
big
boozers
and
you
can
find
it
been
wanting
to
try
this
but
at
that
price
point
you
could
land
a
world
class
bourbon
alone
so
very
hesitant
shared
a
pour
from
someone
very
good
but
not
worth
it
o
well
worth
the
experience
and
splitting
a
bottle
or
slow
sipping
one
is
worth
the
price
tag
especially
at
abv
of
around
29
and
the
age
and
blend
that
make
up
this
beauty
overall
2012
2013
which
smelledtasted
a
lot
like
the
chinese
sorghum
whiskey
that
my
dad
likes
to
drink
that
is
incredibly
disgusting
and
makes
me
nauseous
the
2012
version
is
so
decadent
sweet
and
boozy
it
is
definitely
the
superior
vintage
of
the
2
so
if
you
find
a
2012
and
want
to
buy
it
go
for
it
cant
give
that
same
affirmation
for
the
2013
o
this
ale
totally
surprised
me
in
how
smooth
it
was
compared
to
the
abv
i
could
drink
a
much
bigger
pour
this
was
really
good
and
the
price
is
very
hefty
but
certainly
worth
a
try
and
dare
i
say
i
would
have
this
again
overall
few
beers
match
the
overthetop
descriptors
used
on
their
bottles
but
this
one
does
extremely
complex
overall
well
im
definitely
sticking
to
beer
and
not
liquor
but
for
a
hybrid
between
the
two
this
was
quite
good
i
doubt
ill
buy
full
bottles
of
it
very
often
before
i
win
the
lottery
but
it
is
very
nice
to
have
every
now
and
then
the
taste
is
sticky
honey
rich
sherry
sweetness
with
red
wine
tannins
some
molasses
and
dense
malts
balanced
with
a
bit
of
heat
a
great
sipper
similar
to
how
id
expect
to
enjoy
a
fine
port
or
cognac
though
i
am
embarassingly
uneducated
in
those
elixirs
the
good
people
at
boston
beer
brought
five
gallons
of
this
to
big
beers
in
vail
this
weekend
and
i
have
to
thank
them
because
i
would
never
be
able
to
afford
to
try
this
one
of
a
kind
brew
any
other
way
with
much
anticipation
my
glass
is
filled
with
a
hazelnut
colored
liquid
that
shines
mellow
bronze
on
the
edges
and
has
essentially
no
head
the
nose
is
hotly
alcoholic
i
smell
it
long
before
it
even
gets
to
my
nose
very
intense
but
i
also
smell
rich
malted
barley
the
start
of
homemade
caramel
is
white
sugar
just
sweats
in
the
pan
and
a
woody
vanill
vibe
that
reminds
me
of
a
good
bourbon
the
taste
is
more
like
a
cognac
than
a
bourbon
or
a
beer
through
and
thats
what
i
notice
the
most
its
not
nearly
as
sweet
as
it
smells
either
but
has
some
necessary
residual
sugar
to
soften
the
alcohol
burn
it
almost
feels
distilled
instead
of
brewed
i
get
a
ton
of
wood
on
the
finish
like
a
combination
of
countless
barrels
its
a
little
bit
of
everything
rolled
into
one
but
it
somehow
to
me
at
least
makes
beautiful
beer
i
know
others
have
been
critical
of
the
lack
of
carbonation
massive
still
body
and
the
price
tag
on
this
beer
which
is
certainly
not
for
everyone
but
i
found
it
positively
delightful
would
i
buy
it
maybe
but
i
am
overjoyed
that
i
got
to
sample
this
and
honestly
a
sample
is
all
you
really
need
with
this
strength
and
intensity
of
flavors
this
proves
that
sam
adams
still
makes
some
of
the
most
far
out
beer
in
the
world
even
if
the
flagship
brands
are
super
safe
o
outstanding
sorry
i
waited
so
long
to
open
this
one
or
maybe
not
oan
absolutely
amazing
beer
so
glad
i
was
able
to
try
this
it
is
worth
seeking
out
to
try
i
am
thoroughly
impressed
beyond
any
expectations
an
entirely
different
experience
in
taste
and
i
have
been
doing
some
serious
research
in
beer
this
last
year
or
so
got
a
bottle
of
elijah
craig
12
waiting
to
drown
out
the
expected
yukkiness
but
honestly
i
think
it
may
be
the
other
way
around
this
truly
is
nectar
i
have
to
give
this
one
all
5s
and
it
is
not
due
to
the
price
this
is
truly
an
elixir
to
be
experienced
finding
this
beer
is
a
search
in
its
own
i
managed
to
get
a
bottle
of
the
10th
anniversary
edition
which
because
it
ages
i
am
saving
until
a
very
special
moment
simply
amazing
i
saved
this
for
my
500th
review
and
truly
picked
a
good
one
for
it
thanks
jeff
i
really
did
appreciate
it
atmosphere
is
nice
fruit
and
candied
sweet
nose
flavor
follows
suit
overall
this
is
a
great
quaff
everybody
needs
to
try
this
beer
once
it
represents
the
pinnacle
of
how
far
you
can
take
beer
and
still
keep
it
tasty
3oz
pour
pours
deep
clear
brown
with
no
head
smells
is
absolutely
amazing
i
get
a
lot
of
the
barrel
dark
fruit
cherries
port
carmel
chcolate
slightly
smoky
taste
is
sweet
up
front
coniac
flavors
dark
fruit
again
oak
perfect
sweetness
chocolate
and
carmel
flavors
like
the
nose
this
beer
is
amazing
and
im
so
glad
i
got
to
try
it
the
sweetness
is
spot
on
heavy
oak
flavors
nice
plum
cherry
and
other
dark
fruits
texture
is
thinner
than
youd
think
in
a
really
good
way
no
burn
either
this
is
on
another
level
and
its
so
unique
o
forget
the
beer
moniker
this
is
an
exceptional
beverage
under
any
category
people
complain
about
the
price
but
when
you
normalize
the
cost
per
abv
and
volume
buying
this
beer
for
200
at
24oz
is
like
spending
270
for
a
750ml
of
fine
cognac
thats
not
a
bad
price
to
spend
for
an
exceptionally
blended
mixture
of
1
to
20
year
old
aged
tinctures
o
obviously
this
is
a
nontraditional
beer
this
is
a
tremendously
complex
beverage
and
to
pigeonhole
it
into
any
category
other
than
barrelaged
blended
alcoholic
beverage
is
to
do
it
a
disservice
enjoy
it
for
its
uniqueness
o
this
is
an
amazing
brew
although
it
seems
more
like
a
liquor
tasted
on
multiple
occasions
poured
from
the
tap
at
the
gabf
cant
say
i
agree
with
the
general
public
on
this
one
the
taste
was
extremely
sweet
nearing
that
of
cough
syrup
the
alcohol
percentage
was
difficult
to
hide
with
significant
alcohol
burn
mouthfeel
was
nice
and
rich
however
overall
this
isnt
one
i
would
want
to
try
again
nice
try
sam
adams
i
really
appreciate
the
opportunity
to
have
considered
this
fine
ale
thanks
to
dustin
fargnolli
of
sam
the
beer
manand
it
wouldnt
have
been
the
same
if
i
hadnt
shared
it
with
a
fellow
advocate
thanks
jay
o
my
mind
is
blown
every
time
that
i
try
this
very
special
brew
i
love
to
sit
and
watch
the
amber
elixir
slowly
tear
down
the
walls
of
the
glass
not
what
i
think
of
when
i
hear
the
word
beer
but
thats
part
of
the
mystique
surrounding
the
utopias
overall
glad
i
bought
this
one
however
i
really
dont
care
for
it
yes
i
gave
it
all

this
was
my
first
time
having
the
legendary
utopia
and
after
hearing
some
grave
reviews
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
i
am
a
huge
port
fan
so
this
was
a
nice
treat
for
me
i
definitely
enjoyed
this
beer
would
i
pay
200
for
my
own
bottle
probably
not
but
an
ounce
an
a
half
was
enough
for
me
to
experience
something
great
and
finally
know
what
it
tasted
like

this
is
my
second
1oz
serving
in
two
days
and
it
is
truly
remarkable
something
i
would
have
never
imagined
id
ever
have
im
glad
to
be
one
of
the
manyfew
in
ontario
to
get
a
bottle
and
i
will
savor
every
drop
overall
i
can
safely
say
ive
never
had
beer
like
this
before
it
definitely
comes
across
more
like
a
cordial
than
beer
and
drinking
it
would
follow
suit
its
meant
to
be
enjoyed
at
room
temperature
and
in
small
savory
sips
this
batch
has
very
complex
flavors
ive
read
that
oxidation
is
part
of
the
appeal
of
this
beer
in
other
words
you
open
the
bottle
screw
the
cap
back
on
when
done
and
leave
it
be
like
most
liquors
since
i
cant
personally
speak
to
how
this
may
taste
a
year
from
now
i
would
risk
a
guess
that
it
will
be
as
equally
tasty
as
it
is
from
a
recently
opened
bottle
if
given
the
chance
to
try
it
or
any
of
the
previous
batches
youll
definitely
want
to
add
it
to
your
tried
beers
list
as
with
others
i
had
trouble
rating
this
beer
as
it
is
a
wholly
unique
beverage
i
was
extremely
glad
to
have
gotten
a
chance
to
try
it
would
i
shell
out
the
funds
for
another
tough
call
would
definitely
go
in
on
a
bottle
with
friends
was
treated
to
a
sample
today
at
three
bling
monks
in
garfield
nj
in
a
single
word
delicious
and
thanks
to
brian
for
the
sample
i
would
say
though
that
to
call
this
a
beer
is
almost
a
misnomer
as
the
taste
is
really
more
like
a
liquor
or
brandy
tasty
for
sure
but
difficult
to
call
it
a
beer
the
rating
system
for
this
is
difficult
cause
i
dont
feel
like
im
rating
a
beer
aromas
are
sticky
sweet
big
raisin
and
prune
nutty
sweet
tawny
port
flavors
are
largely
the
same
flavors
linger
long
into
the
finish
seems
like
any
number
of
aged
strong
ales
hardys
jw
lees
etc
albeit
with
a
nitro
boost
of
alcohol
what
mars
the
experience
to
me
is
the
jarring
astringent
bite
from
the
alcohol
which
is
more
akin
to
sipping
a
whiskey
neat
the
complexity
and
flavors
are
there
its
just
not
as
easy
to
sip
as
it
could
be
maybe
27
has
something
to
do
with
it
again
my
personal
preference
is
for
beer
andor
whiskey
not
a
hybrid
though
this
is
an
exceptionally
unique
product
o
a
rare
experience
graciously
extended
by
a
local
pub
owner
would
have
a
hard
time
paying
300
for
a
24
ounce
bottle
but
glad
i
tried
it
stupendous
one
of
a
kind
there
are
no
words
but
i
tried
my
best
from
notes
72811
tried
2011
and
2007
versions
vanilla
sherry
caramel
toffee
and
some
booze
make
up
the
aroma
there
are
also
notes
of
raisins
grapes
and
brandy
lots
of
molasses
its
complex
and
layered
tons
of
barrel
flavor
very
smooth
feel
little
booze
in
the
taste
deep
amber
color
and
still
the
11
had
a
better
aroma
and
the
07
the
better
taste
but
they
were
fairly
similar
and
it
could
have
been
bottle
variation
taste
is
fairly
sweet
but
lots
going
on
big
molasses
fruit
bourbon
and
other
spirits
oak
treacle
caramel
very
tasty
the
smell
of
this
beer
is
extraordinary
cognac
bourbon
vanilla
this
is
the
only
beer
i
have
ever
tried
that
i
could
sit
and
sip
all
night
i
was
able
to
sample
a
few
ounces
as
part
of
a
split
with
friends
the
beer
pours
deep
brownblack
with
no
head
it
leaves
a
nice
oil
slick
in
the
mouth
which
allows
you
to
savor
the
flavor
there
is
no
hint
of
beer
in
the
flavor
as
it
tastes
like
a
very
smooth
cognac
if
you
asked
1000
people
non
beer
geeks
to
taste
it
i
doubt
anyone
would
say
it
was
a
beer
it
is
certainly
worth
it
to
split
the
cost
with
some
friends
but
i
can
buy
a
few
great
bottles
of
single
malt
scotch
and
a
bottle
of
bourbon
for
less
money
i
feel
priviledged
to
have
sampled
this
and
although
i
sampled
twice
certainly
memorable
and
worth
it
definitely
have
my
eye
on
utopias
from
now
on
kudos
sam
adams
o
an
excellent
experience
trying
this
it
is
a
very
complex
brew
the
various
barrels
work
really
well
together
presenting
an
up
front
flavor
which
is
more
like
a
fine
spirit
than
a
beer
the
finish
however
is
pure
malty
delciousness
reminding
you
that
you
are
drinking
a
beer
i
very
much
recommend
seeking
out
a
pour
but
be
warned
the
server
at
churchkey
said
it
lasts
34
weeks
after
opening
before
succumbing
to
noticeable
oxidation
so
purchasing
a
whole
bottle
is
probably
not
a
good
idea
unless
you
have
several
friends
to
share
it
with
o
overall
analysis
a
very
good
complexity
that
shows
through
even
in
limited
volume
would
love
to
get
a
longer
appreciation
for
this
but
i
guess
thats
what
the
multiple
servings
are
for
to
be
consumed
like
a
fine
very
expensive
wine
with
each
sip
being
gentle
small
with
a
long
drawn
out
swallow
very
savoring
this
is
a
once
in
a
lifetime
purchase
for
me
at
300
a
bottle
was
it
worth
it
only
for
self
satisfactor
sake
the
bottle
is
quite
the
appeal
and
makes
for
a
good
show
piece
best
split
with
friends
or
experienced
by
the
glass
at
an
establishment
if
you
want
to
experience
this
first
hand
27
abv
was
not
as
boozy
as
one
would
think
ive
had
beers
10
that
seemed
more
potent
then
this
just
take
it
easy
with
small
mangable
sips
to
much
and
that
27
will
smack
some
sense
into
you
o
this
is
the
pinnacle
of
sipping
beers
sweet
complex
and
warming
this
is
a
beer
i
will
savor
for
a
long
time
overall
glad
i
tried
this
one
but
not
wanting
it
again
even
more
boozy
than
the
29
or
whatever
it
is
would
suggest
the
sweetness
i
think
is
what
makes
it
a
little
too
unbareable
d
drinkable
in
the
traditional
sense
is
not
something
nth
at
applies
to
a
beer
like
this
the
aroma
is
spectacular
the
flavor
is
excellent
also
but
with
a
sweetness
that
is
still
slightly
excessive
oddly
pleasant
for
such
an
over
the
top
drink
overall
this
is
a
wonderful
ale
i
see
it
more
of
a
brandy
something
to
sip
on
among
fiends
but
very
much
worth
the
experience
o
this
absolutely
lived
up
to
the
hype
and
i
cant
wait
to
see
what
happens
to
it
over
the
years
if
youve
been
thinking
about
dropping
the
amount
of
money
it
costs
to
taste
this
dont
wait
any
longer
4
5
great
for
what
it
is
the
nose
is
a
little
simple
likewise
the
mouth
feel
i
would
just
as
well
have
had
a
good
dark
brandy
or
cognac
that
being
said
it
is
one
off
my
bucket
list
and
amazing
for
a
beer
the
achieve
this
level
of
smooth
complexity
and
malty
depth
thoroughly
enjoyed
pours
a
clear
brown
with
no
head
legs
of
beer
form
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
brown
sugar
sherry
and
port
taste
is
much
the
same
with
some
wood
and
maple
flavors
as
well
there
is
an
alcohol
burn
in
the
throat
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
no
carbonation
but
there
is
a
smooth
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
that
is
extremely
strong
and
extremely
rich
but
super
tasty
o
ive
had
the
09
and
think
11
goes
crazy
over
the
top
of
it
the
09
had
to
many
sherry
vinous
flavors
to
it
where
the
11
has
that
rich
malted
palate
that
lets
you
know
its
a
beer
much
better
than
expected
and
will
be
aging
for
a
while
can
only
imagine
what
this
could
turn
into
perfect
in
my
book
not
much
room
for
improvement
at
this
high
of
an
abv
being
that
i
am
also
a
wine
lover
the
best
way
for
me
to
describe
the
10th
anniversary
utopias
is
as
a
bad
port
wine
it
smells
and
looks
similar
to
a
port
with
dark
brown
cognac
like
features
and
tastes
like
one
unfortunately
a
bad
one
very
heated
in
the
mouth
and
all
sorts
of
flavors
but
they
are
subdued
by
the
bad
alcohol
taste
i
had
the
2009
earlier
this
year
and
it
was
much
better
thn
the
10th
anniv
imo
you
are
much
better
off
buying
a
30
warres
port
if
you
are
looking
for
this
taste
i
was
very
much
looking
forward
to
this
one
with
all
the
hype
it
had
around
and
since
i
very
much
liked
the
2009
but
this
one
was
just
a
diasppoinment
unfortunately
some
friends
all
chipped
in
to
buy
a
bottle
to
drink
at
our
company
xmas
party
we
poured
the
entire
bottle
into
14
small
tasting
glasses
dark
brown
body
no
carbonation
totally
still
smell
was
ripe
with
rum
barrels
and
booze
taste
was
intense
and
powerful
rum
port
caramel
raisins
toffee
sugar
cane
all
came
to
mind
mouthfeel
was
silky
smooth
and
luscious
like
a
nice
cognac
this
beer
really
stretched
the
definition
of
what
beer
is
even
even
though
it
was
high
priced
it
was
worth
it
i
though
that
this
was
better
than
some
top
shelf
rums
or
bourbons
ive
ordered
before
o
this
is
more
an
aperitif
than
a
beer
you
probably
will
not
want
to
drink
it
after
coming
home
from
work
or
otherwise
have
too
much
of
it
in
many
respects
as
just
about
everybody
knows
its
more
a
distilled
spirit
than
a
beer
o
some
say
it
is
not
worth
the
price
but
i
can
say
that
i
bought
two
bottles
one
to
keep
and
one
to
trade
now
i
can
honestly
say
that
i
am
keeping
all
400
00
worth
of
this
stuff
and
will
save
it
for
years
to
come
to
sip
in
celebration
and
with
friends
overall
even
with
all
the
5
0
scores
above
i
still
must
give
utopias
2012
an
overall
score
of
only
3
5
because
of
its
price
it
was
probably
worth
this
oneshot
group
purchase
just
to
see
what
all
the
fuss
is
about
but
if
jim
koch
wants
me
to
buy
future
editions
itd
need
to
be
priced
closer
to
50
retail
its
production
economics
probably
wouldnt
cooperate
with
that
price
point
though
oh
well
i
can
still
buy
plenty
of
supertasty
other
beers
with
what
a
single
bottle
of
utopias
costs
o
very
delicious
but
not
worth
the
cost
effort
or
hype
this
ceases
to
be
a
beer
to
me
ive
had
dessert
wines
that
have
had
almost
the
exact
same
taste
overall
its
more
than
a
beer
its
an
experience
for
sure
is
it
worth
the
price
i
would
say
if
its
divided
up
among
several
people
it
is
definitely
something
to
try
once
in
your
life
personally
loved
having
it
o
this
is
great
tasty
and
quite
enjoyable
is
it
worth
the
money
not
especially
is
it
worth
a
try
if
you
can
get
a
hold
of
it
for
sure
small
sample
thanks
to
scotchzi
pours
a
flat
clear
reddish
amber
with
big
legs
dripping
with
a
swirl
nose
is
ultra
starchy
and
rice
wine
like
specifically
huangjiu
or
yellow
alcohol
chinese
rice
wine
its
tough
to
describe
but
heavy
red
bean
starch
sweet
toffee
not
as
much
smoke
and
rice
character
as
huangjiu
and
more
savory
soy
and
saltwater
as
it
opens
updecants
you
are
rewarded
with
cinnamon
and
amaretto
still
enormous
umami
character
like
porcini
mushroom
and
beef
bouillon
interesting
combo
taste
is
sour
lemon
up
front
with
mild
alcohol
heat
ending
with
big
starchiness
and
more
lemon
mild
oxidized
character
interesting
alcohol
heat
is
not
an
issue
palate
seems
decently
viscous
hard
to
compare
to
other
barleywines
as
this
is
more
like
brandy
and
rice
wine
blended
im
very
grateful
for
the
sample
but
i
think
it
is
safe
to
say
i
would
not
spend
100
on
a
bottle
though
you
get
to
savor
this
over
a
long
period
like
scotch
so
maybe
it
is
worth
it
pours
a
mahogany
caramel
color
with
no
head
the
nose
is
almost
like
amaretto
and
brandy
together
chocolate
covered
cherries
almonds
maple
pecans
definite
booze
heat
obviously
caramel
molasses
and
some
slight
red
grape
notes
the
taste
is
very
sweet
maple
almond
oak
cherry
chocolate
booze
pecans
caramel
and
molasses
it
is
syrupy
sticky
sweet
very
hot
it
is
definitely
a
lot
different
than
a
beer
it
kind
of
deserves
its
own
classification
it
is
fermented
like
beer
but
it
is
like
drinking
a
liquor
like
cognac
or
brandy
i
love
it
but
i
dont
know
if
i
can
call
it
a
favorite
beer
maybe
my
favorite
liqueur
hard
to
call
it
a
beer
but
this
is
great
stuff
ive
been
sipping
on
this
bottle
for
2
years
and
it
hasnt
lost
a
thing
a
great
beer
to
try
if
youre
willing
to
shell
out
the
dollars
o
really
a
crazy
beer
flavors
are
ridiculous
and
its
different
than
anything
i
have
ever
tried
try
it
if
you
can
the
body
is
full
and
flat
no
carbonation
but
full
and
smooth
feels
nice
overall
this
is
a
nice
treat
real
enjoyable
but
i
just
assume
have
whiskey
or
some
other
comperable
spirit
the
drinkability
is
moderate
to
high
on
this
one
pour
it
in
a
snifter
and
sip
away
o
overall
this
far
exceeded
my
expectations
stuff
is
absurdly
good
it
really
is
worth
the
160
as
far
as
im
concerned
man
oh
man
not
sure
this
is
really
a
beer
but
hey
it
was
nice
to
try
o
this
is
a
very
good
drink
though
its
not
exactly
beer
in
the
classical
sense
of
the
word
sure
its
technically
beer
but
this
one
is
more
in
line
with
a
sherry
or
a
port
than
a
beer
if
you
like
those
drinks
and
can
appreciate
this
brew
for
what
it
is
youll
find
this
beer
to
be
quite
complex
incredibly
balanced
and
easily
drinkable
greta
to
try
and
if
i
could
afford
it
id
buy
it
more
often
o
very
interesting
beer
all
around
but
have
to
say
it
was
pretty
tasty
considering
the
heat
on
this
booze
bomb
b
this
one
doesnt
even
deserve
the
typical
way
i
do
reviews
nor
does
even
remotely
deserve
to
be
on
the
top
100
for
even
a
second
i
commend
sa
for
doing
what
they
did
with
this
but
overall
its
a
syrupy
mess
heavy
fruit
and
syrupy
malt
on
the
nose
and
same
in
the
flavor
it
actually
starts
off
like
it
might
taste
good
then
takes
a
dive
i
mean
its
not
bad
its
just
not
that
good
the
mouth
is
exactly
what
youd
expect
flat
syrup
shame
on
you
guys
for
rating
this
as
an
exceptional
beer
overall
a
very
unique
and
tasty
beer
experience
enjoyed
with
great
friends
too
bad
it
costs
so
much
otherwise
i
may
have
sought
it
out
more
still
worth
it
though
if
you
can
find
a
group
to
enjoy
it
with
notes
what
a
treat
this
really
reminds
me
of
spanish
brandies
and
other
local
blends
like
quinas
they
were
in
the
mix
of
barrels
for
this
2011
edition
and
they
do
shine
beautifully
memories
of
a
cardenal
mendoza
so
this
is
something
that
may
appeal
to
anyone
keen
on
that
sweet
complex
brandy
range
it
has
some
of
that
carlos
i
and
duque
de
alba
range
but
the
final
sweet
complexity
puts
it
closer
to
cardenal
mendoza
than
anything
else
ive
ever
tasted
if
one
can
afford
it
at
the
suggested
retail
prize
this
is
a
delight
to
have
and
share
with
people
either
intrigued
by
the
limits
of
beer
or
this
complex
brandy
cognac
solera
blends
pushing
the
price
at
the
retail
point
i
guess
might
develop
part
of
the
legend
but
hurts
the
accessibility
to
something
that
is
already
pretty
pricey
at
this
price
range
if
i
can
afford
it
then
id
love
to
have
access
to
a
bottle
of
the
next
vintage
in
2013
thanks
luke
and
manning
for
making
this
possible
a
great
beer
and
very
glad
to
have
tried
it
drink
i
am
still
not
sure
how
this
qualifies
as
a
beer
i
had
this
in
2009
and
just
didnt
appreciate
it
as
much
i
hope
one
day
i
can
buy
a
bottle
and
take
little
sips
each
year
to
see
how
this
changes
i
am
sure
it
would
be
just
wonderful
o
an
interesting
beer
very
complex
and
boozy
o
alcohol
is
surprisingly
wellintegrated
its
like
a
gigantic
sweet
english
barleywine
on
steroids
better
than
expected
big
huge
thanks
to
etan
for
cracking
this
open
dark
brown
with
highlights
of
ruby
nice
legs
aroma
is
very
raisin
brandy
rum
plum
prune
and
a
lot
of
vanilla
brown
sugar
burnt
sugar
and
molasses
some
honey
as
well
extremely
complex
aroma
with
so
much
stuff
going
on
flavor
was
really
sweet
but
not
unpleasantly
so
lots
of
raisin
and
brandy
with
a
nice
heat
from
the
alcohol
mouthfeel
is
sticky
and
viscous
almost
like
a
liquor
i
really
dont
know
what
to
make
of
this
beer
its
really
enjoyable
but
i
dont
know
how
to
think
about
it
cost
retails
at
approximately
200
for
a
750
ml
bottle
that
looks
like
a
brew
kettle
that
is
if
you
are
lucky
enough
to
find
a
bottle
at
the
price
reddish
brown
colour
without
any
head
huge
legs
nose
has
a
big
layer
of
alcohol
over
everything
butterscotch
brandy
cognac
is
quite
prominent
caramel
toffee
oak
too
complex
to
accurately
describe
held
my
nose
to
this
for
ages
before
digging
in
incredible
again
a
layer
of
alcohol
veils
everything
just
a
bit
on
the
palate
but
tofee
nuts
oak
butterscotch
brandy
cognac
brown
sugar
and
some
sweet
chocolate
sweet
and
extremely
desserty
dense
body
with
a
lingering
flavour
thick
alcoholic
but
a
great
warmth
in
the
finish
the
smoothness
at
which
the
alcohol
is
applied
is
fantastic
a
spectacular
offering
and
unlike
any
beer
ive
ever
had
before
certainly
something
i
could
smell
all
day
complex
enough
to
not
simply
be
a
drink
that
the
lowest
common
denominator
would
flock
to
given
its
price
probably
not
a
problem
but
overall
a
neat
and
good
experience
but
eh
could
never
see
drinking
more
than
3oz
of
this
obviously
utopias
is
not
your
average
beer
and
is
hard
to
rate
on
the
same
scale
as
the
others
i
have
reviewed
on
this
site
as
i
alluded
to
earlier
this
is
a
sipper
of
a
beer
that
is
certainly
meant
to
be
enjoyed
like
a
fine
brandy
or
scotch
i
also
enjoyed
mine
with
my
awesome
beer
nerd
friends
tchopcraver
tcgoalie
buckyfresh
which
is
something
that
i
also
recommend
if
you
are
able
to
track
down
a
bottle
of
this
ultimately
i
found
this
beer
to
be
quite
tasty
and
if
money
were
not
a
concern
i
would
probably
try
to
buy
it
every
time
it
came
out
and
pop
one
open
for
a
special
occasion
pours
a
cloudy
dark
browmahogany
with
no
head
the
initial
aroma
that
i
detect
is
nutty
pecans
with
vanilla
bourbon
dark
fruits
plums
figs
raisins
some
port
like
qualities
and
a
touch
of
alcohol
the
taste
has
amazingly
very
little
alcohol
perception
dark
fruit
and
port
qualities
dominate
the
flavor
figs
plums
raisins
oak
bourbon
and
a
touch
of
alcohol
the
mouthfeel
is
very
syrupy
and
viscous
with
no
carbonation
and
a
sweet
lingering
finish
overall
this
is
an
exceptional
beer
and
im
very
glad
that
i
finally
got
to
try
it
o
incredible
if
this
beer
isnt
perfect
then
nothing
is
if
you
can
appreciate
a
barrelaged
beer
take
that
times
infinity
and
you
have
utopias
kind
of
pricey
but
i
can
totally
understand
why
save
this
for
special
occasions
and
you
wont
be
disappointed
bottom
line
this
beer
is
absolutely
fantastic
and
worth
seeking
out
birth
a
child
to
trade
for
a
bottle
mortgage
your
grandmother
or
just
chip
in
30
with
six
of
your
best
friends
and
split
a
bottle
utopias
is
no
bargain
but
its
easily
one
of
the
best
beers
on
the
planet
and
certainly
the
most
unique
o
fantastically
interesting
almost
certainly
not
worth
the
money
but
what
a
bottle
and
what
a
beer
i
highly
recommend
you
try
some
pours
a
clear
ruby
brown
with
no
head
obviously
the
aroma
on
this
puppy
can
be
smelled
from
a
mile
away
the
aroma
is
a
ton
of
dark
fruit
from
the
start
a
huge
dose
of
prunes
and
raisins
there
is
a
caramelly
sweetness
that
reminds
of
candied
raisins
and
the
malt
is
laughing
and
dancing
in
the
background
one
can
also
find
sour
cherries
and
a
huge
alcohol
burn
this
tastes
like
a
million
things
the
flaovr
is
extremely
sweet
up
front
like
glazed
prunes
and
cherries
mixed
with
fresh
caramel
and
cream
with
a
dash
of
vanilla
the
malt
is
also
quite
present
adding
layers
of
flavor
and
even
roast
and
a
dash
of
coffee
if
you
really
search
the
mouthfeel
is
really
unique
creamy
and
thick
coating
the
mouth
along
with
a
burn
from
the
alcohol
but
you
dont
taste
so
much
as
feel
it
this
is
awesome
stuff
o
well
this
is
a
very
nice
beverage
but
im
not
sure
if
its
more
like
port
than
beer
worth
the
money
of
course
not
overall
it
was
such
a
unique
and
delicious
beer
very
complex
with
a
lot
of
really
great
bold
flavors
to
it
it
was
a
little
hot
and
boozy
but
that
was
expected
for
what
it
is
wonderful
beer
overall
this
is
a
serious
treat
to
have
im
very
glad
i
pulled
the
trigger
on
this
large
purchase
however
im
not
sure
id
do
it
again
sure
its
unique
its
delicious
but
its
pricey
as
hell
one
to
absolutely
make
sure
you
experience
in
your
life
but
something
not
needed
to
always
be
on
hand
o
i
mean
its
a
200
bottle
of
beer
can
i
tell
you
to
buy
this
with
a
straight
face
hell
yes
i
can
its
worth
it
team
up
with
your
buddies
split
it
10
ways
i
dont
care
what
you
do
just
make
sure
you
get
your
hands
on
a
2
oz
pour
of
utopias
while
you
are
still
a
beer
fanatic
it
is
unlike
anything
i
have
ever
had
before
it
truly
is
a
port
but
man
is
it
lipsmackingly
tasty
it
definitely
drinks
boozy
but
somehow
maintains
a
pleasantness
and
smoothness
that
is
unbelievable
if
you
have
the
budget
grab
this
one
sort
out
the
details
later
up
to
and
including
charging
your
bestest
buds
20
a
pop
for
their
pours
a
generous
pour
yields
a
cognac
like
liquid
still
and
a
brownishcopperamber
color
aromas
of
madeira
wine
brandy
butterscotch
toffee
caramel
brown
sugar
alcohol
vague
fruits
a
complex
nose
that
boasts
a
lot
of
character
in
the
taste
concentrated
munich
malts
chocolates
vanilla
dry
oak
generic
fruits
bourbon
sherry
brown
sugar
alcohol
toffee
maple
candy
and
butterscotch
mouthfeel
is
slick
chewy
right
around
medium
bodied
but
no
carbonation
like
a
fine
liquor
overall
utopias
is
a
beast
of
a
beer
and
pushes
the
boundaries
of
what
beer
really
is
and
can
be
i
recommend
trying
this
but
a
whole
bottle
would
last
me
a
long
long
time
boston
beer
company
can
consider
this
one
a
success
and
a
brew
worthy
of
a
great
celebration
i
say
force
carbonate
this
and
see
what
happens
o
i
have
wanted
to
try
this
for
a
long
time
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
tried
this
year
very
unique
beer
love
the
smell
and
flavors
of
this
beer
ive
had
this
one
twice
not
sure
what
years
something
like
08
and
09
although
i
do
not
care
for
sam
adams
one
bit
this
was
a
rare
treat
to
try
i
of
course
would
never
pay
to
try
this
but
never
turn
down
free
samples
i
actully
had
a
large
serving
of
this
both
times
and
enjoyed
it
very
much
very
dark
and
heavy
my
bes
comparison
would
be
a
nice
port
that
is
less
sweat
and
more
of
a
bourbon
flavor
both
of
which
i
love
so
this
was
right
up
my
alley
o
i
was
always
kind
off
intimidated
by
the
brew
especially
because
i
thought
that
for
the
price
i
would
not
enjoy
it
i
must
say
im
very
surprised
pleasantly
it
is
very
delicious
i
dont
know
if
i
would
drop
the
150
on
the
bottle
every
time
but
i
know
that
this
bottle
will
last
me
a
while
and
i
will
enjoy
it
thoroughly
very
complex
delicious
and
well
crafted
nice
job
bbc
definitely
my
fave
of
your
brews

poured
a
still
fairly
clear
brown
with
nice
legs
that
coat
the
glass
as
you
swirl
huge
aromas
of
sweet
malt
raisins
sherry
maple
syrup
tootsie
rolls
and
alcohol
taste
is
wow
much
like
the
nose
tons
of
malt
oak
raisins
figs
sherryand
sweet
maple
syrup
obviously
boozy
but
so
complex
and
surprisingly
drinkable
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
sticky
with
the
requisite
alcohol
burn
such
an
amazing
experience
i
dont
know
how
long
id
sit
on
a
bottle
if
i
had
one
i
could
drink
a
ounce
or
two
of
this
every
evening
as
a
nightcap
o
again
pleasantly
surprised
with
this
beer
its
a
delicious
treat
to
savor
once
but
glad
i
didnt
foot
the
bill
for
the
bottle
an
after
dinner
sweet
treat
to
be
enjoyed
with
dessert
o
fantastic
beer
really
only
would
drink
on
special
occasions
felt
sophisticated
drinking
it
would
want
more
and
more
if
it
wasnt
so
damn
expensive
thanks
again
señor
siege
your
generosity
is
unrivaled
overall
when
a
beer
can
be
opened
and
still
stored
for
weeks
or
months
the
line
between
beer
and
liquor
has
justifiably
become
blurred
there
is
just
an
incredible
amount
of
complexity
involved
with
this
beer
that
makes
it
very
difficult
to
judge
did
i
really
enjoy
it
yes
it
was
amazing
could
i
drink
more
than
4
oz
that
would
be
tough
do
i
regularly
want
to
pay
165
for
a
bottle
of
it
probably
not
scoring
this
beer
is
difficult
pours
a
transparent
copper
brown
color
with
no
head
the
nose
has
a
fair
bit
of
whiskey
up
front
notes
of
roasted
barrel
and
some
untertones
of
vanilla
sweet
caramel
and
an
earthy
root
type
aroma
the
taste
is
similar
sweet
caramel
root
beer
a
piney
syrup
earthy
and
root
like
with
some
notes
of
chocolate
strong
whiskeybourbon
notes
lots
of
heats
with
a
fair
bit
of
sugar
left
over
syrupy
feel
chewy
and
viscous
well
carbonated
and
a
touch
of
driness
in
the
finish
lots
going
on
spirit
like
a
touch
all
over
the
place
cheers
great
taste
but
i
wasnt
too
crazy
about
the
aroma
way
too
hot
still
to
me
this
kind
of
takes
away
the
whole
beer
drinking
expierence
at
27
id
love
to
drink
this
again
but
thats
not
going
to
happen
with
the
insane
pricetag
an
amazing
beer
non
the
less
but
id
prolly
take
a
matt
deliverence
or
black
tuesday
over
this
the
same
big
sweet
flavors
with
minimal
booze
still
cheers
to
sam
adams
for
this
insane
offering
overall
i
am
glad
i
was
able
to
sample
this
beer
it
is
excellent
as
a
novelty
beer
but
is
is
really
not
beer
at
this
abv
in
my
opinion
more
like
an
aperitif
or
a
desert
wine
too
sweet
and
boost
overall
to
be
enjoyed
often
or
even
a
few
times
a
year
to
be
honest
and
boost
overall
recommended
definitely
tontry
once
in
your
beer
lifetime
and
to
say
that
you
tried
it
but
not
something
i
need
to
revisit
anytime
soon
the
beer
is
dark
walnut
brown
hued
with
ruby
highlights
no
head
or
lace
the
aroma
brings
oak
booze
brandy
smells
intense
whoa
what
a
flavor
thick
and
syrupy
yet
ridiculously
smooth
palate
coating
alcohol
masterfully
hidden
brandy
toffee
booze
oak
port
scotch
smoke
just
terrific
a
great
choice
for
an
after
dinner
sipping
beer
would
love
to
have
some
of
this
in
the
cellar
ideal
for
a
nightcap
on
special
occasions
one
of
a
kind
stunning
complex
balanced
challenging
and
yet
very
personable
highly
recommended
glowing
bronzecopper
color
with
zero
carbonation
and
lots
of
legs
there
is
so
much
going
on
in
the
nose
smells
so
much
like
cognac
with
lots
of
vanilla
oak
caramel
toffee
with
hints
of
maple
the
balance
that
is
obtained
in
this
beer
even
with
the
abv
and
the
amount
of
blending
and
aging
is
just
fantastic
the
tiniest
of
tiny
sips
explodes
on
the
tongue
with
so
much
flavor
this
beer
is
nothing
short
of
spectacular
the
smell
and
taste
completely
take
over
your
senses
i
was
lucky
to
get
a
sizable
portion
for
sampling
one
of
the
most
creative
concoction
something
every
beer
aficionado
must
have
at
least
once
in
their
lifetime
gabf
2011
aroma
is
that
of
caramel
toffee
slight
alcohol
appearance
is
a
beautiful
amber
with
heavy
legs
no
head
taste
was
amazing
like
a
very
delicious
maple
syrup
cognac
like
taste
palate
was
warming
and
smooth
perfect
sweetness
alcohol
balance
overall
an
amazing
beer
something
i
was
lucky
enough
to
try
i
dont
know
if
i
would
ever
buy
one
with
the
amazing
price
tag
but
its
definitely
something
special
overall
a
very
unique
and
delicious
after
dinner
beer
that
was
enjoyed
with
good
company
i
cant
wait
to
have
this
again
come
thanksgiving
and
christmas
time
my
brotherinlaw
thought
this
was
absolutely
incredible
and
is
also
looking
forward
to
visiting
this
again
with
a
bit
more
age
on
it
while
one
could
taste
the
alcohol
obviously
it
was
less
prominent
than
one
would
have
expected
a
sipper
for
the
ages
o
spectacular
not
much
else
to
say
here
awesome
flavors
strong
booze
doesnt
get
in
the
way
of
the
flavors
either
this
beer
absolutely
has
lived
up
to
the
hype
and
everything
that
precedes
it
very
happy
to
get
a
shot
to
try
this
and
i
will
enjoy
the
bottle
for
quite
a
while
overall
super
complex
and
good
such
a
unique
beer
i
feel
like
i
picked
up
a
new
taste
every
time
i
took
a
sip
definitely
will
have
again
this
is
a
fantastic
stylebusting
beer
i
feel
very
privileged
to
have
tried
it
however
at
160bottle
2011
i
am
not
sure
i
would
ever
really
want
a
bottle
for
myself
the
beer
is
hot
and
is
a
great
sipper
but
it
really
reminds
me
of
a
bottle
of
lost
abbey
deliverance
but
stronger
not
to
detract
from
the
quality
of
the
beer
but
i
really
feel
like
the
pricetoenjoyment
ratio
just
does
not
pan
out
on
this
one
for
me
personally
good
shit
though
overall
this
was
well
worth
the
wait
i
love
it
and
am
glad
that
i
bought
a
bottle
i
plan
to
enjoy
it
slowly
over
time
with
friends
and
for
occasions
a
modern
marvel
thats
quite
tasty
in
its
own
right
im
not
sure
ill
go
rushing
out
to
buy
a
150
bottle
any
time
soon
but
then
again
i
am
tempted
i
won
a
4
ounce
sample
of
the
2011
vintage
at
a
festival
best
10
bucks
ever
spent
poured
into
a
tasting
glass
dark
brown
headless
pour
the
aroma
is
amazing
oak
vanilla
bourbon
hot
booze
the
taste
is
as
amazing
as
the
aroma
finishes
with
lingering
caramel
and
vanilla
the
beer
is
smooth
and
sticky
no
carbonation
actually
makes
it
smoother
the
beer
exceeded
what
i
was
expecting
my
first
5
i
definitely
will
be
looking
for
more
do
at
first
encounter
this
beer
exhibits
a
convulsioninducing
quality
that
reminds
of
the
way
that
an
actor
takes
a
stiff
drink
its
early
flavors
overwhelm
the
senses
while
remaining
true
to
the
smell
it
is
able
to
lift
the
bourbon
and
other
spirits
from
the
wood
successfully
yet
their
presence
is
shortlived
the
latter
two
acts
are
surprisingly
vacantnot
by
the
standards
of
normal
beer
but
in
this
case
compared
to
the
beginning
utopias
may
be
the
posterchild
of
extreme
beer
in
america
possibly
in
need
of
a
new
style
that
is
the
plankowner
of
overall
this
outrageous
strong
ale
represents
a
huge
achievement
in
craft
brewing
prior
to
tasting
i
didnt
know
if
id
enjoy
it
since
im
not
a
big
fan
of
hard
liquor
however
it
defied
my
expectations
with
its
smooth
bold
flavours
and
enormous
depth
of
character
a
boundarypushing
asa
that
further
expands
the
notion
of
what
beer
can
be
absolutely
a
magnificent
example
of
how
far
beer
can
go
worth
150
maybe
or
maybe
not
at
least
the
bottle
will
last
a
long
time
as
a
night
cap
beer
o
i
was
a
bit
apprehensive
about
the
overall
experience
with
this
one
based
on
abv
but
utopias
is
surprisingly
drinkable
o
this
as
expected
was
a
very
different
beer
incredibly
rich
with
an
interesting
alcohol
bite
that
would
intrigue
those
who
enjoy
sipping
on
bourbon
seeing
the
high
price
on
this
beer
gives
me
the
lingering
suspicion
that
i
have
tried
it
for
both
the
first
and
last
time
what
a
foreboding
feeling
overall
very
good
but
not
what
i
expected
with
the
hype
and
price
i
have
a
feeling
it
will
be
amazing
in
time
overall
amazing
beer
overall
i
am
so
glad
that
i
shelled
out
15
for
a
2
ounce
pour
this
would
rate
as
as
good
a
whiskeycognac
as
ive
ever
had
phenomenal
if
you
have
the
chance
try
it
overall
i
was
not
let
down
at
all
been
waiting
a
while
to
try
this
beer
at
27
if
i
had
a
bottle
it
would
take
a
long
while
to
get
through
it
the
sheer
cost
would
also
be
a
consideration
nice
sipper
one
you
truly
have
an
ounce
or
two
at
a
time
very
interesting
beer
and
worth
trying
if
you
can
get
your
hands
on
some
deep
deep
mahogany
broze
color
huge
aroma
of
vanilla
caramel
and
maple
syrupit
comes
at
you
from
even
down
on
the
counter
in
the
glass
lightly
oaked
just
a
gamut
of
flavorshuge
caramelmaple
flavors
vanilla
and
oak
trace
of
booziness
serious
malty
quality
going
on
decent
mouthfeelvery
sticky
and
gummyhas
to
be
from
residual
sugars
but
still
nice
just
a
great
experience
all
in
obviously
a
sippersmall
doses
and
special
occassions
are
just
the
thing
this
was
enjoyable
especially
since
i
didnt
pay
for
the
bottle
it
barely
resembles
beer
this
is
much
more
like
an
after
dinner
drink
i
like
it
but
im
sure
its
not
for
everyone
o
exceeds
expectations
i
have
had
tactical
nuclear
penguin
and
did
not
like
it
this
takes
everything
wrong
with
it
and
makes
it
right
great
flavors
paired
with
good
alcoholic
heat
glad
i
had
the
chance
to
try
this
2007
vintage
pours
a
dark
amber
with
obviously
no
head
but
it
does
leave
some
serious
legs
on
the
glass
as
it
is
swirled
huge
aroma
with
big
molasses
some
brown
sugar
a
significant
amount
of
booze
unsurprisingly
brandy
and
vanilla
taste
is
pretty
sweet
but
not
cloying
the
molasses
and
brown
sugar
are
present
brandy
and
vanilla
comes
through
as
well
a
little
bit
of
maple
the
alcohol
is
certainly
present
but
surprisingly
restrained
given
the
abv
and
the
amount
present
on
the
nose
full
bodied
no
carbonation
drinks
similar
to
something
like
a
cognac
but
the
beer
qualities
are
certainly
there
unique
and
enjoyable
im
glad
to
have
tried
it
sam
adams
utopias
was
the
longest
one
ounce
of
beer
ive
ever
drank
it
was
certainly
the
most
expensive
and
probably
the
most
impressive
too
i
wanted
to
take
the
glass
home
with
me
just
to
keep
smelling
it
good
thing
i
couldnt
i
bet
weeks
later
my
girlfriend
would
be
pleading
with
me
to
finally
wash
the
thing
and
i
still
wouldnt
want
to
drinking
utopias
after
awhile
you
sort
of
get
lost
in
another
world
and
you
dont
want
to
leave
it
notes
had
a
1
1
5
oz
snifter
at
the
sanctuary
in
iowa
city
very
nice
beer
to
sip
on
with
amazing
flavors
and
a
nice
warming
feel
alcohol
was
surprisingly
well
hidden
i
loved
how
the
barrels
affected
this
beer
they
really
helped
make
this
an
excellent
sipper
impressive
complex
its
a
malt
liqueur
and
aged
in
everything
tastes
kind
of
like
everything
but
not
a
clash
paired
with
fritos
flavor
twists
honey
bbq
its
a
pedestrian
pairing
but
the
sweetness
and
potency
of
the
utopias
does
pair
pretty
well
with
the
msg
and
sodium
of
the
twists
overall
a
hell
of
a
beer
thats
more
like
a
sipping
whiskey
or
port
very
cool
would
love
another
2oz
of
this
in
the
future
very
interesting
how
they
brewed
this
without
icing
and
you
can
tell
because
its
far
better
than
the
iced
beers
out
there
d
wow
what
can
i
say
i
love
this
stuff
absolutely
worth
the
wait
great
across
the
board
i
really
liked
this
beer
could
have
been
a
bit
thicker
but
overall
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
it
i
really
cant
get
enough
of
the
smell
my
nose
was
pretty
much
shoved
in
the
glass
for
a
whole
minute
great
aromas
and
fantastic
taste
great
job
sa
i
want
the
bottle
2003
vintage
huge
thanks
to
john
for
starting
things
off
with
this
in
the
wee
hours
of
the
morning
it
was
dark
so
hard
to
see
but
seemed
like
a
deep
dark
murky
brown
or
purple
in
the
little
light
i
had
to
work
with
the
smell
was
rich
syrupy
caramel
the
taste
followed
the
nose
fairly
sweet
but
extremely
drinkable
i
only
had
a
very
small
sample
but
this
went
down
smooth
and
warmed
me
up
immediately
on
a
tiny
sip
as
i
battled
the
weather
at
that
ungodly
hour
of
the
morning
a
beer
like
this
is
unique
and
surprisingly
together
the
fact
that
you
can
drink
it
and
reseal
it
and
it
will
still
last
for
years
makes
it
really
an
anamoly
but
it
works
o
this
is
really
a
unique
and
special
beer
i
put
beer
in
quotes
for
the
obvious
reasons
that
it
just
isnt
like
any
other
beer
it
lacks
carbonation
and
thats
weird
to
be
drinking
a
beer
that
doesnt
have
carbonation
but
the
overall
complexity
contained
within
that
copperkettle
bottle
is
one
of
the
biggest
reasons
to
go
find
this
beer
massive
thanks
goes
out
to
cmrillo
who
shared
this
one
with
the
group
at
the
evening
wood
tasting
graciously
hosted
by
cmrillo
as
well

bottle
8458
served
from
bottle
into
a
mikkeller
flute
poured
ruby
red
with
a
very
minimal
offwhite
head
there
was
no
lacing
evident
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
caramel
alcohol
duh
and
wood
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
caramel
big
alcohol
no
shocker
here
peat
and
wood
it
had
a
medium
feel
on
the
palate
with
very
low
carbonation
overall
this
brew
was
excellent
im
really
glad
i
finally
got
the
opportunity
to
give
this
one
a
shot
i
thought
this
was
going
to
kill
me
on
the
alcohol
but
sam
adams
did
a
fantastic
job
on
making
it
as
sweet
as
possible
to
cut
back
on
the
burn
and
overwhelming
alcohol
flavor
you
get
in
other
high
abv
brews
really
enjoyed
getting
the
chance
to
try
this
one
this
one
only
came
out
during
the
tasting
for
one
of
two
reasons
i
think
either
a
rillo
was
really
drunk
or
b
i
mentioned
to
him
that
i
had
never
tried
utopias
before
either
were
possible
at
this
point
honestly
whatever
the
reason
im
glad
i
got
the
chance
and
i
am
seriously
debating
on
buying
a
bottle
for
myself
in
the
future
based
on
this
experience
dispite
the
high
price
overall
this
is
an
beer
experience
unlike
any
other
ive
had
before
you
need
to
try
this
beer
if
only
just
for
one
sip
the
complexity
of
this
blew
me
away
its
defines
the
term
sipper
unbelievably
impressive
creation
cheers
to
sam
adams
serving
type
bottle
into
a
taster
do
great
way
to
stretch
the
definition
of
beer
yet
again
strong
flavors
that
remind
me
of
other
liquors
while
still
staying
true
to
the
traditional
methods
might
not
appeal
to
some
but
its
a
great
blend
of
flavors
this
is
not
your
regular
beer
and
shouldnt
be
consumed
as
such
appreciate
this
for
what
it
is
instead
of
what
you
expect
it
to
be
and
its
rather
incredulous
im
not
really
sure
if
its
worth
the
price
but
its
definitely
incredulous
im
just
glad
i
was
able
to
partake
utopias
was
an
odd
choice
for
a
sunny
june
evening
in
boston
but
then
again
it
does
sort
of
make
the
evening
its
own
ill
be
curious
to
see
how
it
pairs
with
a
roaring
fire
in
december
o
hard
to
even
call
this
a
beer
it
really
is
like
a
sipping
after
dinner
drink
loads
of
complexity
it
was
amazing
overall
its
a
fun
drink
but
for
the
amount
and
price
you
have
to
pay
i
think
ill
have
to
pass
but
i
am
very
glad
i
tried
it
o
there
is
no
way
in
gods
green
earth
i
would
ever
pay
over
250
a
bottle
for
this
stuff
but
doesnt
everyone
say
that
still
though
this
was
pretty
damn
good
im
glad
it
exists
for
those
willing
to
fork
over
the
big
dough
and
thanks
to
harrymel
for
forking
over
the
dough
so
i
didnt
have
to
gfunk
overall
it
was
a
good
enough
experience
just
much
different
than
i
had
anticipated
it
would
be
this
beer
surprised
me
o
i
was
expecting
a
crazy
boozy
mess
with
this
one
something
like
a
huge
high
alcohol
infused
beer
but
it
wasnt
anything
of
the
sort
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
o
if
it
wasnt
as
expensive
as
it
is
i
would
have
a
really
hard
time
not
downing
this
whole
bottle
an
amazing
beer
that
i
see
myself
getting
every
time
it
comes
out
easy
to
drink
great
complex
characteristics
and
a
special
treat
for
the
holidays
pours
a
clean
deep
amber
to
brown
in
color
with
no
head
in
the
aroma
caramel
maple
syrup
hints
of
dark
cherry
and
alcohol
in
the
taste
dark
cherry
sweetness
caramel
and
butterscotch
and
dont
forget
about
the
alcohol
burn
a
smooth
and
medium
to
bigger
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
small
dry
alcohol
and
caramel
and
dark
cherry
sweetness
in
the
aftertaste
wow
big
alcohol
like
drinking
a
shot
nice
flavor
but
very
boozy
i
think
2oz
is
all
anyone
really
needs
overall
s
glad
i
was
able
to
try
this
a
bottle
by
itself
might
have
been
too
much
especially
here
in
hawaii
where
the
shipping
cost
is
applied
to
almost
everything
its
definitely
a
sipper
i
think
the
real
kicker
is
the
bottle
and
the
feeling
of
refinement
that
you
get
from
drinking
this
ale
although
the
taste
did
live
up
to
the
hype
and
i
appreciate
the
concept
the
idea
of
buying
a
bottle
that
is
upward
into
the
160200
range
seems
to
be
overreaching
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
it
is
a
very
special
thing
and
sam
adams
is
a
really
cool
to
still
be
pushing
the
boundaries
of
beer
i
will
certainly
buy
more
of
these
in
the
future
and
see
how
this
beer
continues
to
evolve
over
the
future
vintages
d
people
say
this
is
not
like
a
beer
but
it
really
is
its
like
an
amped
up
barrel
aged
beer
i
got
notes
similar
to
angels
share
grand
cru
raison
dextra
10
year
old
j
w
lees
and
cbs
along
with
notes
of
cognac
and
rum
ive
been
looking
forward
to
this
beer
for
some
time
now
id
love
to
try
some
other
vintages
but
i
dont
see
that
happening
anytime
soon
ill
just
continue
to
enjoy
this
tasty
treat
a
few
ounces
at
a
time
o
i
think
ill
make
this
a
tradition
and
get
a
bottle
of
newer
vintages
when
they
come
out
ive
had
this
at
a
beer
best
before
but
it
was
a
really
small
amount
and
i
guess
i
didnt
fully
appreciate
it
to
have
a
bit
more
of
a
serving
is
just
wonderful
to
take
in
all
the
textures
flavors
and
aromas
this
is
great
and
i
really
enjoyed
it
a
true
sipper
though
this
beer
pours
a
dark
caramel
color
and
is
of
course
flat
so
it
has
no
head
or
lacing
but
some
nice
legs
form
as
the
liquid
is
swirled
due
to
the
high
alcohol
content
the
nose
is
full
vanilla
caramel
and
hot
alcohol
vapor
i
also
get
notes
of
black
figs
and
dates
the
flavor
has
all
of
these
flavors
plus
notes
of
red
grapes
dark
cherries
sweet
brown
sugar
woody
oak
and
maybe
a
hint
of
toffee
bread
crust
and
other
sweet
sugary
fruits
there
is
a
nutty
quality
with
flavors
that
remind
me
of
ground
walnuts
the
finish
is
very
sweet
and
it
coasts
my
mouth
in
syrupy
sugar
the
body
and
mouthfeel
are
thick
and
heavy
and
not
as
hot
as
the
nose
suggests
i
wish
this
beer
was
more
affordable
so
i
could
drink
it
more
often
but
i
can
definitely
taste
the
quality
i
could
drink
this
every
night
and
im
afraid
my
bottle
is
starting
to
get
low
my
bottle
shop
still
has
more
i
may
have
to
splurge
on
another
i
want
to
love
this
beer
the
effort
and
the
time
spend
to
create
this
18
year
of
barrel
aging
6
different
barrels
blended
i
mean
how
amazing
is
that
effort
the
problem
is
this
isnt
coming
off
as
so
dramatically
different
from
beers
i
can
get
for
612
bucks
a
bottle
there
is
a
flavor
here
that
is
in
j
w
lee
that
i
want
to
describe
i
think
perhaps
it
is
a
result
of
the
hops
but
i
just
cant
describe
it
and
i
didnt
like
it
in
j
w
less
but
here
im
finding
myself
more
and
more
interested
in
it
at
4050
bucks
a
bottle
this
would
be
outstanding
beer
but
170
a
bottle
makes
this
simply
an
incredibly
underwhelming
experience
i
really
hate
myself
for
taking
this
feeling
but
beer
has
to
be
graded
as
beer
and
frankly
this
isnt
beer
by
any
normal
measure
im
not
sure
what
color
something
like
this
should
be
or
how
to
score
the
appearance
as
it
has
no
comparison
im
not
sure
how
to
score
the
mouth
feel
as
this
is
only
27
but
the
alcohol
kicks
nearly
as
well
as
some
smoother
bourbons
im
glad
to
have
tried
this
and
ill
enjoy
the
rest
of
this
bottle
i
do
hope
this
ages
well
open
as
i
can
see
some
rather
good
changes
to
come
in
time
10
months
later
and
i
was
curious
as
to
how
this
has
held
up
so
i
poured
an
ounce
tons
of
brown
sugar
and
maple
with
less
dark
fruits
booze
still
present
as
expected
o
thoroughly
unique
this
is
my
second
time
having
this
and
its
just
as
good
expensive
as
all
get
out
but
this
is
something
every
beer
geek
needs
to
try
at
least
once
at
170200
a
bottle
in
my
area
this
certainly
is
not
a
common
brew
itd
be
a
stretch
to
even
consider
this
a
onceayear
treat
certainly
its
a
special
occasion
sipper
oits
definitely
tasty
each
sip
leaves
you
begging
for
more
i
couldnt
drink
a
whole
glass
of
this
though
not
because
of
the
alcohol
but
because
of
the
sweetness
the
abv
actually
doesnt
come
in
to
play
too
much
at
all
here
this
just
isnt
something
youd
drink
if
you
want
a
good
beer
this
is
more
for
a
night
recap
when
your
favorite
relatives
are
in
town
this
is
definitely
a
must
try
for
anyone
though
whether
youre
a
beer
lover
or
not
overall
im
blown
away
im
putting
this
baby
on
the
shelf
and
saving
it
for
special
occasions
i
feel
like
ill
buy
another
one
next
time
around
because
they
apparently
keep
getting
better
from
what
ive
heard
that
being
said
i
feel
spoiled
having
started
with
this
edition
cheers
overall
this
is
barely
a
beer
its
got
some
beer
traits
but
it
really
pushes
the
boundaries
of
a
beer
its
more
of
a
beerspirit
hybrid
for
as
strong
as
it
is
its
reasonably
mellow
there
is
only
a
slight
burn
deep
in
the
finish
but
ive
had
worse
from
other
beers
overall
this
is
surprisingly
smooth
and
im
glad
i
picked
up
a
bottle
2011
edition
poured
into
a
port
glass
nice
copper
color
with
no
visible
head
heavy
appearance
in
the
glass
the
smell
at
first
is
a
lot
of
alcohol
but
that
passes
any
you
get
a
wonderful
raisin
molasses
combination
very
reminiscent
of
a
lbv
port
heavy
smooth
liqueur
type
mouth
feel
taste
is
difficult
to
describe
first
thing
i
notice
is
an
unusual
prickly
carbonation
feel
on
the
tongue
then
raisins
nuts
maybe
some
sherry
finished
with
molasses
wine
and
wood
some
nice
bitterness
too
nothing
else
like
it
so
its
not
really
comparable
overall
outstanding
fantastic
i
dont
know
if
i
could
call
this
a
beer
it
is
more
of
a
dessert
wine
than
anything
else
the
aroma
is
the
best
i
have
ever
felt
from
a
beer
or
from
any
beverage
for
that
matter
on
the
tongue
raisins
dried
fruits
and
all
kinds
of
other
sweet
flavours
mix
together
to
give
ou
a
sugar
overdose
only
to
be
perfectly
balanced
by
an
easy
alcoholic
touch
from
the
28
abv
glourious
amber
colour
in
the
glass
with
a
pleasant
body
for
the
palate
did
i
mention
the
perfect
aroma
drink
and
overall
glad
i
got
to
try
it
awesome
product
very
unique
idea
and
i
think
they
really
have
some
thing
great
i
was
very
impressed
with
how
nonspirit
like
it
is
im
a
big
bourbon
guy
but
the
mouth
is
nothing
of
a
distilled
spirit
fantastic
2009
bottle
kevin
you
still
owe
me
65
for
this
pours
a
somewhat
hazy
dark
chestnut
brown
with
ruby
edges
no
head
or
lacing
nose
is
very
pungent
heavy
whiskey
barrel
tends
toward
a
spirit
for
sure
lots
of
roasted
marshmellow
heavily
sugared
and
hot
stinging
and
really
hot
in
the
mouth
caramel
sugar
earthy
spicy
rooty
per
kevin
peppermint
and
root
beer
lots
of
roasted
marshmallow
some
maple
syrup
sort
of
difficult
despite
all
the
complexities
this
beer
pours
a
nice
brown
color
with
basically
no
head
the
smell
is
sweet
and
boozy
with
hints
of
bourbon
maple
and
vanilla
the
flavor
is
very
close
the
the
aroma
withe
the
sweet
booziness
up
front
followed
by
the
bourbon
and
maple
notes
with
a
hint
of
vanilla
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
with
low
carbonation
overall
this
beer
was
surpassingly
drinkable
for
the
abv
but
that
is
likely
due
to
how
sweet
it
is
which
almost
becomes
cloying
at
times
was
nice
to
try
but
would
likely
never
buy
bought
a
bottle
on
this
in
november
of
2009
opened
it
in
january
of
2010
ive
been
having
a
few
sips
out
of
it
over
the
last
year
or
so
just
to
see
if
there
is
any
changes
taking
place
of
over
time
the
major
change
ive
noticed
is
that
the
smell
of
maple
is
much
stronger
now
than
it
was
when
it
was
new
the
flavor
is
also
along
the
same
lines
the
maple
is
really
coming
through
now
its
almost
like
i
should
put
it
on
pancakes
or
something
for
a
beer
thats
over
20
abv
its
very
smooth
there
isnt
much
of
an
alcohol
burn
this
beer
is
just
all
around
very
impressive
i
dont
know
if
ill
ever
buy
it
again
but
im
proud
that
i
got
some
when
i
did
d
overall
utopias
is
a
very
nice
beer
from
sam
adams
given
the
high
abv
and
the
mouthfeel
it
is
certainly
a
sipper
and
certainly
something
best
consumed
in
2
oz
samples
i
thought
it
had
a
great
complex
smell
and
would
definitely
like
to
have
it
again
dont
think
i
would
pay
180200
for
a
bottle
but
if
given
the
chance
would
love
another
2
oz
sample
of
this
maybe
if
this
was
called
something
else
i
would
have
been
more
receptive
to
the
taste
but
to
call
it
beer
is
sacrilege
to
me
can
you
imagine
calling
something
that
was
20
wine
wine
makers
and
experts
would
label
you
an
idiot
this
should
not
be
on
this
list
imo
hence
the
very
low
marks
would
i
buy
another
bottle
if
i
had
the
chance
probably
not
but
not
because
it
wasnt
good
this
is
such
a
complex
drink
that
to
describe
it
as
beer
really
doesnt
do
it
any
justice
im
glad
to
have
tried
it
and
glad
to
be
able
to
mark
it
off
my
bucket
list
and
would
encourage
anyone
who
has
the
chance
to
do
the
same
had
a
1
5
ounce
pour
at
beer
bistro
in
toronto
i
think
it
was
the
2009
version
that
came
into
ontario
comes
out
a
clear
amberbrown
colour
there
is
no
head
or
lacing
but
it
is
supposed
to
be
still
so
i
cant
fault
the
beer
for
that
i
dont
know
how
to
judge
appearance
on
this
it
would
be
like
judging
appearing
on
congac
they
all
look
basically
the
same
to
me
on
the
smell
alcohol
first
seems
to
be
there
but
then
i
get
vanilla
and
strong
caramel
and
maple
this
reminds
me
a
bit
of
the
remy
martin
xo
congac
smooth
mouthfeel
as
youd
expect
with
no
carbonation
a
little
bit
boozy
but
this
was
really
delicious
glad
i
got
to
try
it
pours
just
like
a
cognac
no
head
dark
reddish
brown
lacing
all
over
glass
thin
yet
syrupy
no
crabonation
smells
of
congac
stron
alcohol
caramel
oak
vanilla
notes
sweet
and
malty
taste
of
dark
fruits
caramel
vanilla
and
lots
of
maple
syrup
notes
cognac
back
into
play
dry
finish
with
a
heavy
alcohol
burn
very
smooth
and
silky
as
it
goes
down
which
makes
it
more
of
a
beer
than
a
spirit
to
me
this
is
a
very
slow
sipper
4
ounces
took
me
over
an
hour
but
it
was
well
worth
it
glad
i
saved
this
bottle
and
still
have
another
to
save
for
many
more
years
really
is
worth
all
of
the
hype
and
the
150
a
bottle
pours
a
clear
mahogany
color
with
no
head
and
no
lacing
smells
of
caramel
figs
and
rum
tastes
of
rum
figs
and
tons
and
tons
of
caramel
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
it
has
no
carbonation
drinkability
is
tough
it
really
is
pretty
good
d
a
truly
original
and
breathtaking
offering
by
sam
adams
this
competes
with
many
of
the
topshelf
singlemalts
bourbons
and
rums
i
have
encountered
when
it
comes
to
complexity
and
flavor
balance
definitely
worth
a
try
if
you
are
lucky
enough
to
come
across
a
bottle
d
i
made
my
small
pour
last
an
hour
so
as
to
enjoy
it
as
much
as
possible
and
let
it
warm
in
order
to
really
appreciate
it
looking
forward
to
trying
out
other
years
here
and
there
in
the
future
really
really
good
recommend
cheers
had
this
in
las
vegas
from
the
freakin
frog
brew
pub
thanks
to
my
beer
aficionado
buddy
who
treated
me
with
this
brew
on
the
night
of
my
bachelor
party
i
thought
this
interesting
brew
was
strong
alcoholysyrupy
almost
brandylike
amber
in
color
like
maple
syrup
the
flavor
is
like
a
brandy
with
maple
and
walnut
very
warming
with
an
alcohol
finish
also
a
bit
of
vanilla
it
is
uniquely
complex
smooth
and
sticky
mouth
feel
the
cpj
d
this
is
a
sure
sipper
and
is
still
a
little
hot
rich
full
sweet
and
delicious
it
is
still
quite
enjoyable
i
will
definitely
be
on
the
lookout
for
the
2011
vintage
this
year
pours
brown
and
thick
with
reddish
tints
no
carbonation
as
expected
very
strong
biosphere
on
the
nose
smells
very
much
like
cognac
lots
of
fruity
smells
plum
perhaps
with
caramel
too
complex
and
smells
great
tastes
boozy
but
has
a
lot
of
oak
and
caramel
and
fruits
overall
very
drinkable
for
27
great
to
try
would
never
pay
the
price
for
it
it
has
a
sweet
boozy
smell
and
a
wonderful
scotchbrown
color
this
beer
leaves
long
great
legs
on
a
glass
what
a
wonderful
treat
to
share
with
guests
overall
this
is
the
best
stuff
that
i
have
tried
i
am
going
to
have
a
hard
time
making
my
bottle
last
it
is
a
little
pricey
it
did
cost
175
for
the
bottle
but
well
worth
it
it
is
worth
the
expense
to
experience
overall
it
is
very
interesting
and
complex
i
can
see
why
it
appeals
to
beer
drinkers
who
also
drink
nicer
liquor
i
am
extremely
grateful
to
have
tried
it
this
is
not
a
common
beer
it
is
something
to
enjoy
very
slowly
as
a
cognac
it
poured
nothing
like
beer
the
smell
was
somewhat
inviting
though
not
like
beer
it
tasted
bad
it
burned
in
your
mouth
and
its
far
to
expensive
to
drink
that
is
assuming
anyone
would
want
to
d
well
this
is
the
ultimate
fermented
beer
and
it
doesnt
disappoint
i
cant
believe
this
is
beer
and
im
really
happy
i
got
to
try
it
so
complex
and
interesting
easily

best
brew
ive
had

slightly

the

helps
the
finish
for
a
27
beer
this
is
far
better
then
what
i
expected
and
an
excellent

drink
drinkability
rating
keeps
this
1oz
after

pour
in
mind
bottle
sampled
both
the
05
and
the
09
in
one
night
crazy
the
aroma
is
nuts
with
more
of
a
liquor
aroma
with
sweetness
added
even
smells
hot
caramel
vanilla
and
toffee
with
a
taste
of
alcohol
that
is
extremely
unique
oak
notes
as
well
really
glad
i
was
able
to
try
this
and
would
totally
try
this
again
in
the
future
a
sipper
for
sure
is
this
beer
you
need
to
try
it
for
yourself
to
determine
the
body
is
still
and
coats
the
mouth
and
throat
like
nyquil
overall
this
beer
is
insanely
good
in
small
doses
probably
not
worth
the
price
considering
the
type
of
spirits
that
200
could
buy
but
the
price
shouldnt
affect
the
score
the
05
wasnt
as
sweet
i
didnt
like
it
as
much
it
was
more
toned
down
though
i
opened
this
bottle
on
the
new
years
eve
going
into
2010
it
had
a
great
color
to
it
there
really
wasnt
much
head
or
carbonation
at
all
to
this
beer
it
smells
like
brandy
with
notes
of
vanilla
and
very
strong
alcohol
it
tasted
very
much
like
a
brandy
type
beer
with
vanilla
and
caramel
notes
alcohol
was
very
prominent
the
mouthfeel
was
good
it
was
a
little
dense
and
coated
the
mouth
very
good
drinkability
was
surprisingly
good
it
wasnt
harsh
to
where
it
made
it
difficult
to
drink
but
it
definetly
had
a
little
burn
to
it
it
was
a
great
experience
though
it
definitely
pushes
the
envelope
on
what
has
done
before
i
think
it
is
a
great
beer
and
well
worth
the
150
that
i
paid
for
it
i
will
be
looking
forward
to
the
next
bottle
of
this
that
i
purchase
try
it
if
you
get
the
chance
the
appearance
of
this
beer
is
a
headless
caramel
color
with
ruby
red
twinges
when
held
to
the
light
the
aroma
is
like
whiskey
and
a
hell
of
a
lot
of
it
there
may
have
been
nuts
or
caramel
tones
as
well
to
the
aroma
but
the
alcohol
made
it
rather
hard
to
detect
the
taste
however
strongly
resembled
that
of
maple
syrup
partially
due
to
the
beverages
consistence
and
mostly
to
do
with
the
maple
flavor
there
are
some
toffee
and
hazelnut
notes
as
well
along
with
fruit
characteristics
like
cherry
syrup
this
is
a
very
viscous
brew
but
it
is
as
advertised
and
compliments
the
style
quite
well
it
actually
doesnt
really
burn
at
all
for
something
of
such
high
abv
making
it
very
drinkable
for
a
sipping
liquor
im
so
glad
i
had
the
opportunity
to
try
this
it
was
truly
an
interesting
beer
im
curious
to
see
if
this
beer
was
fortified
it
is
better
to
compare
this
to
port
as
it
has
all
of
the
properties
of
a
fortified
wine
pours
very
thick
looks
like
brandy
the
smell
is
very
intense
with
all
of
the
elements
listed
above
plus
dark
plum
and
some
blackberry
the
taste
is
sweet
and
potent
like
maple
syrup
with
vodka
overpowering
but
delicious
worth
having
as
a
treat
or
dessert
the
liquid
is
colored
deep
ruby
there
is
no
head
whatsoever
lots
and
lots
of
film
is
left
behind
as
i
swirl
the
glass
slightly
the
nose
is
very
complex
i
can
smell
alcohol
oak
cognac
burnt
wood
the
taste
is
syrupy
and
sherrylike
with
lots
of
fruits
prunes
dried
apricots
and
other
candied
fruits
its
a
little
sweet
which
works
well
the
finish
is
warm
and
has
some
crystal
sugar
sweetness
the
coat
is
quite
alcoholic
but
also
sweet
and
fruity
i
was
very
afraid
that
utopias
wouldnt
be
very
drinkable
but
it
truly
is
the
first
sip
will
shock
anyone
how
can
a
beer
taste
like
this
but
after
that
it
goes
down
like
any
sipping
hard
alcohol
of
good
quality
i
actually
went
back
for
another
pour
this
drink
is
an
exceptional
inventionprobably
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
and
unlike
any
beer
ive
come
across
it
is
most
definitely
worth
seeking
out
usually
i
dont
do
reviews
with
such
a
small
sample
size
but
with
this
beer
you
really
dont
need
a
large
amount
in
fact
12
ounces
is
the
perfect
pour
for
a
beer
of
this
type
clearly
the
hype
of
utopias
makes
this
a
fun
beer
to
have
reviewed
id
try
it
again
sometime
to
see
if
it
matches
up
to
now
a
delicious
drop
and
something
truly
unique
better
than
any
of
the
other
super
high
alcohol
beers
ive
had
a
strange
side
note
during
our
tasting
1
of
the
individuals
used
a
plastic
ebf
tasting
cup
while
the
rest
used
a
small
4
oz
sampler
glass
utopias
served
in
a
plastic
cup
smells
significantly
different
than
in
the
glass
i
know
it
sounds
strange
but
everyone
at
the
table
recognized
this
difference
in
the
glass
it
smelled
more
metallic
and
the
alcohol
was
much
more
evident
inside
the
plastic
taster
the
smell
was
more
sweet
and
the
alcohol
was
less
pronounced
without
the
previously
mentioned
metallic
twang
this
is
something
to
be
savored
definitely
not
to
be
drank
regularly
i
did
find
it
hard
to
drink
despite
that
it
was
excellent
d
certainly
an
after
dinner
drink
maybe
as
a
nightcap
d
more
than
all
it
is
cracked
up
to
be
drinkability
is
good
for
what
it
is
this
is
the
definition
of
a
sipper
in
both
flavor
intensity
and
abv
quite
pricey
as
well
refined
smooth
and
enjoyable
poured
an
ounce
or
so
into
my
duvel
tulip
2005
vintage
thanks
to
some
guys
at
martys
in
newton
for
calling
me
up
when
they
dug
up
this
gem
pale
brown
orange
and
ruby
tints
looks
like
bourbon
no
carbonation
sugary
enough
to
have
some
legs
nose
is
of
rich
maple
candied
nuts
and
booze
as
you
bring
it
to
your
lips
you
can
feel
the
alcohol
torching
your
palate
already
only
a
small
amount
coats
your
palate
completely
amazingly
enough
booze
and
sugar
do
not
create
that
typical
medicinal
taste
maple
and
honey
flavors
dominate
the
taste
mouthfeel
is
glorious
smooth
and
warm
i
dont
really
know
how
to
comment
on
the
drinkability
other
than
the
fact
that
i
drank
it
all
and
i
want
more
well
it
was
everything
i
thought
it
would
be
which
was
as
my
friend
kingcrowing
put
it
tastes
like
a
fortified
beer
i
have
to
say
i
am
happy
that
imagineiii
was
generous
enough
to
share
this
is
a
really
cool
beer
and
totally
worth
checking
out
if
you
can
right
now
this
was
fantastic
put
a
couple
of
years
on
this
to
mellow
the
booze
out
and
this
would
be
absolutely
awesome
id
imagine
that
the
07
is
drinking
pretty
good
right
now
i
may
have
to
invest
in
a
bottle
of
this
down
the
line
and
see
for
myself
d
i
basically
treated
this
as
a
fine
alcohol
that
i
sipped
on
for
a
few
hours
also
because
it
was
the
only
thing
i
was
able
to
drink
all
night
beer
wise
i
came
in
not
knowing
what
to
think
but
after
having
tried
it
i
am
thoroughly
impressed
i
have
only
tried
this
beer
once
and
quite
honestly
it
may
be
the
very
best
i
have
ever
tried
the
presentation
was
amazing
the
growler
is
entirely
metal
the
color
was
an
nice
amber
in
color
the
flavor
profile
was
not
at
all
overly
sweet
but
instead
consisted
of
fine
malt
from
the
use
of
caramel
vienna
moravian
and
bavarian
smoked
malts
this
was
combined
with
a
balancing
refined
bitterness
all
in
perfect
harmony
while
finishing
with
a
satisfying
dose
of
warming
but
not
burning
alcohol
at
27
alcohol
by
volume
this
deceptively
strong
beer
is
better
compared
to
a
premium
brandy
or
exquisite
sherry
as
opposed
to
any
beer
that
i
have
every
known
even
though
this
beer
was
aged
in
scotch
cognac
and
port
barrels
it
did
not
have
the
overpowering
raisin
or
maple
character
found
in
the
triple
bocks
everything
about
the
utopias
equated
to
balance
and
perfect
harmony
dropping
150
to
200
on
24
ounces
of
beer
seems
a
bit
ludicrous
but
at
a
world
record
27
abv
you
have
to
be
getting
your
moneys
worth
notes
from
02
11
10
at
beer
palace
in
oslo
the
world
wide
stout
became
flavorless
after
the
utopias
but
much
more
drinkable
o
while
it
may
be
very
different
from
what
we
would
normally
consider
a
beer
utopia
is
really
a
fantastic
creation
the
complexity
is
overwhelming
and
im
sure
itll
only
get
better
with
age
worth
every
penny
overall
i
was
elated
to
receive
this
as
a
gift
i
had
stared
at
it
for
a
long
time
not
wanting
to
part
with
the
money
after
the
first
taste
i
knew
it
was
something
id
love
to
keep
and
let
mellow
so
i
quickly
searched
out
another
bottle
not
as
gimmicky
as
some
may
think
this
is
very
enjoyable
and
highly
recommended
drinkability
obviously
not
the
easiest
of
brews
to
down
but
who
said
one
have
to
rush
things
in
life
in
small
sips
utopias
does
wonders
for
the
palate
almost
on
a
side
note
once
again
very
very
similar
to
sweet
mead
vintage
2007
thanks
dan
for
the
sample
pours
completely
still
into
the
tasting
glass
a
nice
rich
auburn
hue
aromas
of
maple
vanilla
cognac
and
caramel
drinking
this
is
more
like
sipping
cognac
than
drinking
beer
lots
of
alcohol
but
also
vanilla
caramel
wood
toffee
and
brown
sugar
very
complex
and
very
delicious
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
again
four
of
us
split
the
bottle
so
ended
up
getting
a
fair
quantity
of
this
titan
and
boy
was
i
happy
about
that
pours
a
hazy
amber
no
head
the
aroma
is
awesome
after
a
minute
or
two
to
let
it
open
up
it
smells
very
sweet
like
maple
syrup
with
a
vanilla
quality
to
it
the
taste
surprised
me
because
of
a
few
things
firstly
the
heat
is
prevalent
as
would
be
expected
but
not
as
much
as
you
would
think
it
is
covered
very
well
by
the
rich
sweetness
the
second
thing
that
surprised
me
was
the
lack
of
bite
i
expected
a
much
bigger
bite
but
that
is
not
to
say
i
was
disappointed
just
pleased
by
in
different
ways
it
had
a
silky
vanillaoak
finish
that
sticks
with
you
quite
a
while
after
each
drink
there
is
no
carbonation
whatsoever
which
was
expected
for
an
afterdinner
type
beer
that
is
to
be
served
at
room
temperature
in
truth
even
though
it
is
brewed
as
a
beer
it
has
much
more
in
common
with
a
nice
cognac
very
drinkable
to
those
who
like
a
heavier
drink
goes
down
easy
and
would
probably
sneak
up
on
you
if
you
kept
drinking
it
all
night
taste
is
just
like
the
smell
lots
of
deep
sweetness
caramel
bourbon
and
honey
with
a
lingering
burn
its
dense
and
rich
with
a
coating
mouthfeel
very
smooth
due
to
the
lack
of
carbonation
much
more
like
a
port
than
a
beer
and
one
id
buy
again
if
it
sold
for
a
reasonable
price
medium
body
no
carbonation
full
of
heat
very
complex
what
a
treat
tastes
like
it
smells
but
with
much
more
honey
and
it
is
quite
hot
very
much
like
a
good
50yr
or
older
tawny
port
such
big
caramel
and
toffee
flavors
good
oak
and
bourbon
really
keeps
things
in
perspective
hugely
complex
light
cocoa
nib
flavors
herbal
tea
fig
date
quince
paste
thick
sticky
and
creamy
a
great
beer
but
just
way
to
expensive
di
appreciate
what
sa
has
done
here
and
find
it
to
be
very
interesting
but
to
actually
sit
and
drink
this
no
it
is
a
novelty
only
i
will
save
my
high
abv
drinks
and
money
for
the
likes
of
real
liquors
such
as
port
cognac
bourbon
and
scotch
the
aged
version
was
certainly
more
palatable
than
the
fresh
version
so
maybe
over
time
i
could
see
myself
sitting
down
with
a
small
snifter
and
enjoying
it
for
the
price
though
see
my
previous
statement
in
the
end
i
had
a
huge
smile
on
my
face
and
my
brain
was
turning
look
forward
to
the
next
try
prosit
it
smelled
like
alcohol
bourbon
vanilla
mixed
with
some
raisin
it
tasted
like
a
beer
liquor
alcohol
bourbon
sweet
vanilla
maple
syrup
prunes
figs
malty
and
nutty
a
true
sipper
after
dinner
warmer
overall
absolutely
delicious
mouthdrink
smooth
but
hot
mouthfeel
obvious
with
the
alcohol
as
high
as
it
is
2oz
each
time
if
enough
for
me
enjoyable
if
youre
a
scotch
or
liquor
drinker
in
general
lots
to
be
discovered
in
each
sip
d
if
i
was
a
cognac
or
port
drinker
i
would
dig
this
for
sure
however
i
found
myself
wishing
that
i
had
a
cold
carbonated
beer
i
wouldnt
have
this
again
however
you
have
to
applaud
the
unique
and
daring
lengths
that
sam
adams
has
gone
to
with
this
one
d
supremely
drinkable
the
2orsoounce
pour
that
i
got
was
enough
to
last
me
a
long
while
and
i
kept
discovering
new
things
with
each
small
sip
next
time
around
i
think
ill
definitely
grab
a
bottle
of
this
to
hold
onto
for
a
while
d
im
so
happy
i
bought
this
beer
for
150
it
truly
is
a
once
in
a
lifetime
experience
i
have
never
had
beer
like
this
and
i
will
most
likely
never
have
one
like
this
again
worth
every
penny
i
could
sip
on
this
one
and
enjoy
a
2
oz
pour
for
hours
this
is
a
sippin
beer
after
i
poured
folks
would
sip
it
set
it
aside
drink
something
else
come
back
to
it
the
taste
really
grew
on
me
hmmm
taste
well
to
start
the
beer
is
medium
to
low
bodied
there
isnt
any
bitterness
or
carbonation
to
sour
it
out
its
sweet
but
not
cloying
at
all
but
it
does
finish
really
really
dry
and
the
alcohol
is
biting
it
really
is
like
sipping
liquor
not
beer
its
plenty
enjoyable
but
after
four
ounces
i
was
ready
to
call
it
quits
i
dont
need
anymore
but
i
would
try
it
again
much
better
than
the
triple
bock
overall
a
solid
and
impressive
beer
in
a
third
time
and
place
it
is
the
hardest
yet
most
satisfying
kegstand
in
the
world
this
beer
is
to
be
respected
or
it
will
kick
your
utopiass
overall
i
was
slightly
underwhelmed
by
this
experience
it
was
no
doubt
a
delicious
beer
but
certainly
not
worth
the
list
price
of
150
imo
luckily
i
had
this
at
a
tasting
for
14oz
quite
enough
for
me
this
brew
is
a
musttry
if
for
nothing
else
than
the
experience
there
are
flavors
all
over
the
place
all
blending
together
with
the
alcohol
to
make
the
most
unique
thing
that
has
ever
been
in
my
mouth
and
possibly
ever
will
be
d
im
glad
i
only
had
a
2oz
pour
of
this
one
cant
and
wont
stand
any
more
of
this
im
really
glad
to
have
had
it
though
and
taste
what
the
commotion
is
all
about
not
worth
the
investment
in
my
opinion
and
might
need
a
couple
of
years
to
tone
down
the
alcohol
and
heat
ill
definately
grab
a
bottle
of
this
next
time
its
around
i
tried
this
beer
back
in
2007
i
was
working
at
a
store
and
my
manager
broke
the
neck
off
one
of
the
4
bottles
we
had
on
accident
the
break
was
perfect
none
of
the
beer
spilled
and
it
didnt
get
into
the
beer
i
poured
the
remaining
into
a
nalgene
bottle
and
saved
it
until
i
got
home
for
a
more
proper
tasting
i
like
this
beer
because
they
are
pushing
the
envelope
and
just
the
idea
of
what
beer
is
and
can
be
no
head
at
all
completely
no
carbonation
lots
of
molasses
and
caramelized
sugars
alcohol
presence
heavy
very
very
warming
it
would
make
for
a
nice
beer
to
enjoy
during
the
heart
of
winter
with
good
friends
vintage
2007
thanks
to
kevin
for
his
generosity
in
sharing
this
both
now
and
at
a
previous
tasting
the
beer
is
a
red
copper
color
displaying
plenty
of
church
windows
aromas
of
cognac
figs
plums
and
raisins
tickle
the
nose
tastes
of
raisin
brown
sugar
and
a
glorious
spiritlike
alcohol
character
that
is
just
delicious
the
body
is
thick
and
smooth
even
without
carbonation
the
feel
is
delightful
high
in
alcohol
but
scrumptious
to
have
sitting
in
the
mouth
this
is
a
beer
i
would
drink
all
the
time
if
it
were
feasible
outstanding
beer
while
some
may
have
beat
it
in
terms
of
abv
they
taste
comparatively
atrocious
to
this
masterpiece
a
masterpiece
ok
im
not
so
sure
if
id
pay
three
figures
for
my
own
bottle
but
for
a
small
dose
at
a
smaller
price
do
what
i
did
and
go
for
it
pours
dark
amber
with
no
head
the
aroma
is
maple
syrup
vanilla
and
caramel
the
flavor
is
alcohol
sherry
port
caramel
vanilla
and
maple
syrup
thin
mouthfeel
and
no
carbonation
the
alcohol
is
pretty
hot
as
you
would
expect
for
a
beer
of
this
strength
but
the
complex
flavors
and
aromas
make
the
beer
outstanding
d
i
was
honestly
expecting
to
not
like
this
beer
once
i
gave
it
a
sniff
and
a
taste
however
i
became
a
believer
in
it
and
should
i
have
a
couple
hundred
bucks
to
spare
i
would
pick
up
one
of
these
o
its
hard
to
rate
this
as
a
beer
more
a
liqueur
one
of
if
not
the
most
complex
beers
ive
ever
had
quite
the
special
experience
big
thanks
to
bryan
brick
at
kl
for
getting
four
bottles
into
their
shop
in
redwood
city
california
my
100th
review
yay
so
very
glad
i
was
able
to
try
it
drinkability
i
suppose
if
you
had
to
factor
in
cost
of
consumption
along
with
abv
this
really
isnt
a
very
drinkable
beer
except
that
in
reality
it
is
though
certainly
as
it
was
intended
to
be
consumed
in
sipping
its
easy
to
enjoy
very
similar
again
to
a
port
or
sherry
though
in
its
own
way
more
complex
and
a
little
tastier
smooth
and
balanced
it
certainly
is
a
great
concoction
worth
the
try
looking
forward
to
sipping
this
bottle
over
some
time
to
come
d
its
a
sipper
dont
be
stupid
for
jebus
christ
sake
its
27
abv
dont
drink
a
pint
i
have
to
say
that
utopias
is
well
out
of
my
daytoday
price
range
even
if
i
could
find
it
i
will
not
disclose
my
seller
as
i
dont
want
to
cause
a
stampede
i
was
first
let
into
the
know
of
utopias
by
a
coworker
of
mine
who
has
to
this
day
not
found
a
bottle
of
for
himself
i
almost
feel
bad
drinkability
i
was
truly
shocked
i
thought
this
beer
was
all
hype
but
after
trying
it
i
change
my
mind
not
sure
id
pay
200
for
it
but
it
was
great
d
wonderfully
drinkable
wish
i
could
have
had
an
entire
glass
of
this
beer
to
really
sip
and
enjoy
d
poured
3
oz
probably
enough
for
now
excited
i
have
more
thanks
again
and
many
cheers
to
josh
for
letting
me
sample
this
treat
i
really
am
glad
i
got
to
try
this
without
shelling
out
2540
in
a
bar
setting
i
really
loved
it
and
was
a
great
experience
and
may
even
look
for
my
own
bottles
as
funds
allow
just
to
be
able
to
pull
out
on
those
special
occasions
not
as
unbeerlike
as
many
bas
seem
to
think
big
and
complex
and
certainly
unique
but
fits
relatively
well
under
the
strong
ale
old
ale
umbrella
d
well
it
is
27
abv
and
it
is
quite
pricey
for
a
taster
it
cost
us
25
00
however
this
a
wonderful
beer
for
anyone
who
has
the
funds
and
appreciation
for
what
it
is
this
is
one
you
have
to
try
at
least
once
d
surprisingly
well
for
the
abv
definitely
a
sipper
this
was
split
amongst
a
small
group
definitely
the
way
to
go
with
this
one
d
nice
drinkable
beer
at
3
to
4
ounces
anything
more
than
that
and
i
think
i
would
have
a
problem
this
beer
isnt
made
to
be
drank
in
huge
amounts
very
interesting
beer
to
say
the
least
which
i
am
glad
i
got
to
try
i
dont
think
it
was
worth
the
price
i
payed
overall
but
i
went
in
on
this
with
a
couple
of
friends
worth
trying
at
least
once
in
your
beer
drinking
life
to
be
honest
i
was
not
too
impressed
with
this
beer
while
i
am
a
samuel
adams
fan
this
beverage
did
not
hit
it
with
me
first
off
its
very
expensive
which
is
the
biggest
turn
off
second
it
drinks
closer
to
a
tawny
port
or
port
wine
maybe
sherry
in
some
cases
its
not
classified
as
beer
because
of
its
fermenting
methods
and
abv
levels
good
taste
very
good
for
sipping
on
dont
get
me
wrong
it
tastes
great
it
just
doesnt
remind
me
of
what
a
beer
should
be
plus
its
not
worth
the
money
this
is
a
great
beer
that
everyone
should
try
if
given
the
opportunity
if
you
find
one
try
to
have
a
few
friends
go
in
on
it
with
you
and
itll
be
more
fulfilling
and
wont
bruise
the
old
wallet
quite
as
much
d
how
do
you
rate
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
a
couple
of
ounces
after
a
meal
is
all
you
really
need
in
that
respect
its
good
45
i
am
sure
many
main
stream
beer
drinkers
would
like
take
a
shot
of
utopias
and
chase
it
with
bud
light
or
even
drop
a
shot
of
this
into
a
pint
of
guiness
but
please
hold
back
the
fratboyhorses
and
enjoy
the
complexity
of
this
beer
it
is
somewhat
hard
to
rate
a
beer
like
this
in
terms
of
drinkability
but
this
stuff
does
go
down
pretty
easy
this
isnt
really
a
beer
its
incredibly
hard
to
rate
within
style
because
im
not
sure
theres
really
a
style
here
its
a
wholly
unique
creation
its
almost
like
a
maple
syrup
port
liqueur
but
not
overly
sweet
glad
for
the
opportunity
probably
wouldnt
buy
a
bottle
but
would
be
happy
to
have
it
again
d
quite
drinkable
err
sippable
considering
the
gravity
but
lets
be
real
its
not
the
first
thing
to
come
to
mind
when
you
think
of
drinkability
no
matter
how
enjoyable
many
have
questioned
whether
or
not
this
can
be
opened
and
enjoyed
over
time
rather
than
all
at
once
i
will
see
over
time
because
there
is
no
damn
way
im
drinking
this
bitch
all
tonight
but
my
first
impression
is
that
you
could
recap
this
and
let
it
sit
just
like
a
bottle
of
booze
what
gives
me
this
impression
oh
i
dont
know
maybe
the
fact
that
this
is
a
bottle
of
booze
this
particular
bottle
is
the
2009
batch
bottle
number
437
pours
into
the
sam
adams
utopias
glass
as
a
brownishred
or
deep
copper
color
swirl
the
glass
gently
and
it
sticks
to
the
sides
like
a
viscous
syrup
this
stuff
is
thick
theres
no
carbonation
and
no
lacing
smells
of
maple
cinnamon
whiskey
bourban
vanilla
perhaps
a
slight
hint
of
butter
very
very
faint
though
the
taste
is
well
good
gawd
is
this
really
beer
i
sip
this
and
think
im
drinking
a
fine
cognac
it
doesnt
taste
like
beer
it
tastes
like
a
cordial
picking
up
nuances
of
vanilla
cinnamon
maple
massive
amounts
bourban
sherry
and
whiskey
in
fact
theres
so
many
different
layers
of
complexity
that
i
cant
even
detect
them
all
theres
a
huge
burning
sensation
in
the
throat
for
an
extended
period
of
time
after
the
sip
the
texture
is
amazingly
velvety
smooth
on
the
tongue
this
is
more
of
a
cognac
than
a
beer
and
im
blown
away
by
this
beer
its
so
incredible
different
and
pushes
the
envelope
to
such
extreme
measure
that
the
line
between
liquor
and
beer
has
now
been
fogged
im
fortunate
to
have
gotten
a
bottle
of
this
through
a
family
connection
i
hope
to
experience
this
again
before
i
die
the
big
down
side
is
because
of
the
50
barrel
quantity
its
darn
hard
to
find
and
when
you
do
who
can
really
afford
it
my
father
in
law
works
for
sam
adams
so
im
blessed
go
ahead
punch
me
d
27
abv
what
do
i
say
goes
down
easy
for
what
it
is
im
just
giving
it
an
average
3
0
because
there
really
is
no
precedent
for
a
beer
like
this
as
it
is
it
is
very
tasty
and
i
am
grateful
to
have
tried
it
ive
got
2
bottles
for
my
bachelor
party
in
january
looking
forward
to
another
great
drink
props
to
my
buddy
jake
for
finding
this
we
cracked
it
on
a
crisp
sunny
fall
day
pours
into
the
glass
like
syrup
a
deep
reddishbrown
obviously
thick
no
carbonation
but
ill
be
damned
if
it
doesnt
leave
legs
on
the
glass
like
a
fine
wine
lots
of
greasy
ones
it
smells
of
alcohol
makes
it
hard
to
smell
really
prunes
and
honey
tastes
of
molasses
maple
syrup
prunes
honey
vanilla
and
oranges
with
a
peppery
and
strong
warming
alcohol
finish
it
has
an
oaklike
aftertaste
and
long
after
the
fact
it
tastes
like
sherry
maybe
it
just
takes
me
a
while
to
identify
that
the
mouthfeel
is
syrupy
but
slippery
absolutely
flat
it
coats
your
tongue
and
seems
to
be
settling
in
to
stay
like
an
unemployed
inlaw
i
cant
call
it
drinkable
really
but
then
again
its
not
that
you
dont
like
it
its
just
that
its
very
clear
that
a
small
amount
is
all
you
need
or
want
in
a
session
really
unusual
really
sweet
very
complex
and
very
very
good
a
fantastic
experience
cheers
to
jake
for
the
opportunity
not
my
cup
of
tea
at
all
but
really
glad
i
had
the
chance
to
try
it
my
hat
is
off
to
the
people
at
sam
adams
for
constructing
such
an
innovative
and
unique
brew
drinkability
what
a
treat
and
definitly
worth
the
expereince
much
better
than
triple
bock
this
is
beyond
beer
in
the
traditional
sense
massive
alcohol
burn
with
a
surprising
amount
of
subtle
earthy
and
and
dark
fruit
character
wonderful
bourbon
oak
character
rich
toffee
and
caramel
a
must
try
excellent
great
snifter
drink
especially
on
a
cold
night
very
much
reminds
me
of
great
tawny
port
if
it
wasnt
so
pricey
and
rare
i
would
drink
this
semi
regularly
pick
up
a
sixer
and
kick
back
with
a
pint
sam
adams
utopias
pours
a
smooth
amberish
red
liquid
with
brilliant
orange
highlights
no
carbonation
and
pure
liqueur
in
appearance
smell
is
strong
wonderfull
blend
of
bourbon
nice
wood
and
other
whiskey
notes
complex
as
any
nose
can
note
taste
has
a
mixed
whiskey
flavor
thats
smooth
strong
and
slightly
sweet
the
strength
is
exeptional
but
far
more
smooth
than
i
ever
expected
feels
like
a
fine
cognac
in
texture
and
density
fine
barrel
wood
types
of
bourbon
linger
in
the
aftertaste
with
a
slight
sweet
note
of
brandy
this
is
one
fine
drink
of
some
strong
booze
my
taste
loves
this
but
its
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
a
special
treat
hats
off
to
the
folks
at
sam
adams
for
creating
this
gem
this
is
very
drinkable
but
it
is
definitely
an
occasion
drink
it
is
just
way
too
rich
and
decadent
to
have
on
a
regular
basis
but
on
the
occasion
that
it
does
get
poured
it
shall
be
enjoyed
thoroughly
overall
this
was
the
most
unique
beer
to
ever
touch
my
lips
im
so
glad
andy
was
able
to
score
a
bottle
and
split
it
with
me
i
look
forward
to
sipping
this
beer
on
cold
wisconsin
nights
fantastic
d
given
how
much
alcohol
is
in
it
this
is
dangerously
drinkable
not
something
you
can
pound
but
easier
to
drink
than
some
normal
beers
ive
had
drinkability
definitely
a
sipper
but
i
would
definitely
have
this
again
im
glad
i
tried
it
and
i
recommend
others
to
try
it
as
well
i
recommend
this
for
cognac
lovers
as
well
as
those
seeking
an
intense
sweet
earthy
raisin
profile
with
an
alcohol
nose
and
presence
throughout
so
complex
and
tasty
so
many
nuances
in
this
in
my
opinion
my
review
does
not
completely
do
this
beer
justice
another
thank
you
to
beerfmandy
for
letting
me
try
this
incredible
spectacular
brew
d
how
can
you
rate
this
beer
anything
less
than
perfect
this
is
a
beer
that
all
other
extreme
beers
will
have
to
match
up
to
there
is
nothing
to
compare
this
too
and
is
so
far
out
there
that
im
not
sure
if
people
will
try
to
match
this
not
only
that
but
its
awesome
not
the
best
beer
ive
ever
had
but
its
up
there
and
for
the
style
its
perfect
overall
a
unique
experience
a
novelty
im
glad
i
had
the
opportunity
to
taste
it
but
for
225
a
bottle
here
in
rochester
id
rather
have
an
early
90s
vintage
thomas
hardys
ale
if
i
am
looking
for
a
similar
experience
utopias
was
awesome
to
try
and
my
second
glass
was
delicious
with
a
cigar
but
180
is
simply
insane
id
love
to
give
the
drinkability
a
5
but
at
some
point
the
price
must
be
factored
in
when
it
gets
to
such
a
level
if
this
were
4050
and
readily
available
it
would
be
a
staple
in
my
house
they
were
selling
this
on
tap
for
15
an
ounce
luckily
my
boy
was
working
at
the
tap
and
gave
me
a
free
taste
nose
was
all
about
whisky
and
honey
the
taste
was
like
a
port
wine
or
mead
with
intense
alcohol
flavor
as
well
this
was
amazing
but
no
beer
is
worth
so
much
money
a
gimmick
if
you
ask
me
but
a
very
very
tasty
gimmick
this
beer
is
phenomenal
it
is
insane
and
a
drinking
experience
unlike
any
other
i
have
experienced
this
is
almost
certainly
the
most
complex
beer
ive
ever
had
the
pleasure
of
drinking
i
am
truly
impressed
with
the
boys
at
boston
beer
co
well
done
sirs
well
done
wow
d
this
beer
is
so
drinkable
its
scary
a
perfect
nightcap
and
sipper
for
the
winter
season
if
someone
gave
me
a
snifter
full
of
this
without
telling
me
a
the
percent
and
b
what
it
was
i
would
probably
be
much
more
drunk
than
id
like
a
great
sipper
that
is
a
fantastic
beer
and
totally
surpasses
the
hype
i
am
pleasantly
surprised
by
the
complexity
of
this
beer
i
really
hope
im
able
to
get
another
taste
of
this
sometime
soon
overall
this
was
a
very
worthwhile
experience
and
one
that
all
should
enjoy
at
least
once
highly
recommended
this
was
an
exceptional
experience
was
able
to
try
it
at
a
tasting
event
at
table
vine
in
west
springfield
ma
there
is
no
real
effervescence
at
all
to
it
the
taste
is
along
the
lines
of
a
bourbon
with
hints
of
maple
syrup
for
the
high
alcohol
content
it
was
incredibly
smooth
with
an
almost
velvety
mouthfeel
to
itvery
easy
to
sip
on
slowly
all
and
all
a
bit
difficult
to
describe
but
a
great
experience
to
say
the
least
this
beer
pours
a
beautiful
brown
color
with
golden
red
highlights
no
head
or
effervescence
to
speak
the
aroma
screams
of
roasty
dark
malt
dark
fruit
and
a
bit
of
hops
hiding
in
the
alcohol
the
taste
is
great
with
the
dark
fruit
the
aging
in
the
casks
really
paid
off
some
really
tasty
sweet
wood
notes
the
biterness
and
the
alcohol
bite
and
low
carbonation
make
this
a
really
amazing
barleywine
damn
near
a
whiskey
thanks
for
the
beer
weswes
the
beer
pours
a
translucent
brown
color
with
no
head
and
a
noticeable
clinging
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
awesome
it
has
a
killer
warmth
to
it
as
well
as
a
damn
complex
array
of
dark
fruits
and
burnt
toffee
the
taste
is
perfect
it
has
an
extremely
complex
mix
of
malt
character
and
alcohol
esters
the
wood
aging
really
adds
a
nice
vanilla
character
that
rounds
out
the
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
perfect
as
well
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
no
carbonation
this
is
an
exceptional
beer
thats
in
a
class
of
its
own
d
im
surprised
by
how
much
i
enjoyed
this
i
expected
it
to
be
some
ridiculous
boozebomb
so
i
flatly
turned
down
the
invitation
to
share
in
splitting
this
up
im
glad
i
was
talked
into
it
afterward
this
was
truly
worth
the
experience
i
can
see
myself
buying
one
in
the
future
as
a
selfgift
if
i
can
swing
something
slightly
better
than
the
200
bottle
price
drinkability
is
surprisingly
high
and
if
not
for
the
potency
id
be
happy
sipping
on
this
for
quite
a
while
this
is
a
great
beer
pretty
much
one
of
a
kind
at
this
point
and
more
than
just
a
gimmick
its
genuinely
enjoyable
utopias
should
be
reserved
for
a
life
altering
celebration
or
an
occasion
where
it
is
the
focus
while
this
is
an
amazing
beer
it
has
few
of
the
standard
qualities
of
beer
one
or
two
ounces
at
a
time
is
plenty
so
amazing
as
it
is
i
find
it
difficult
to
say
this
is
especially
drinkable
i
hope
to
have
another
someday
and
certainly
expect
to
enjoy
it
just
as
much
as
for
cellaring
i
wonder
how
much
it
can
progress
beyond
its
current
state
oh
and
it
floods
back
autumn
memories
sitting
on
the
porch
with
grandpa
his
cigar
and
evening
drink
overall
its
delectable
and
when
you
drink
it
you
understand
the
price
because
this
is
the
definition
of
finely
crafted
beer
if
you
can
even
call
it
that
but
truly
is
an
artfully
developed
masterpiece
by
jim
perfect
showcase
of
my
venture
into
the
beer
world
as
this
is
my
100th
review
ive
come
along
way
from
being
a
beer
noob
to
knowingrespecting
the
likes
of
this
one
o
obviously
a
sipper
it
gets
a
little
too
sweet
after
drinking
a
few
ounces
but
a
few
ounces
will
go
a
long
way
this
was
very
good
and
im
glad
i
had
the
experience
but
at
14ounce
or
150bottle
i
really
dont
think
its
worth
it
as
i
mentioned
above
this
really
isnt
beer
either
i
definitely
wouldnt
think
it
was
beer
if
someone
just
served
it
to
me
without
telling
me
what
it
is
you
can
probably
get
some
nice
liqueurs
for
3040bottle
that
achieve
basically
the
same
thing
that
this
does
d
obviously
a
sipper
but
i
sort
of
understand
the
price
better
now
this
is
a
beer
that
drinks
like
whisky
so
the
bottle
will
last
a
long
time
if
you
have
an
occasional
shot
could
be
nursed
for
months
i
dont
really
know
how
to
review
this
beer
it
is
what
it
is
an
intense
aroma
and
flavor
profile
obviously
meant
to
be
an
after
dinner
drink
i
love
port
wine
and
this
is
very
similar
i
really
enjoy
this
and
worth
a
purchase
if
you
can
get
a
few
friends
to
go
in
with
you
like
i
did
if
you
have
the
means
and
opportunity
pick
it
up
i
was
fortunate
to
try
a
snifter
of
this
at
a
sam
adams
beer
dinner
recently
pours
clear
caramel
with
no
head
smells
amazing
not
like
beer
at
all
but
rather
like
port
or
sherry
or
some
other
similarly
delicious
alcoholic
beverage
smell
stings
your
nostrils
in
a
good
way
with
caramel
vanilla
oak
and
alcoholic
heat
taste
follows
the
smell
and
leaves
that
same
bite
in
the
back
of
your
throat
as
would
brandy
or
sherry
extremely
sweet
body
is
very
thick
and
theres
no
carbonation
whatsoever
overall
a
very
delicious
beverage
but
i
would
not
spend
150
on
a
bottle
say
what
you
will
about
the
price
tag
this
is
an
excellent
beverage
i
think
calling
something
so
high
in
alcohol
that
it
forces
co2
out
of
solution
a
beer
is
a
bit
of
a
stretch
though
it
may
technically
be
a
beer
it
drinks
like
port
and
that
is
how
it
should
be
viewed
in
any
case
i
enjoyed
it
and
if
youre
buyin
ill
have
another
pretty
good
but
you
cant
drink
a
ton
of
this
overall
this
was
amazing
i
could
sip
on
this
all
night
the
epitome
of
a
sipper
for
sure
but
the
flavors
are
very
complex
d
well
its
meant
to
be
a
sipper
and
it
is
really
awesome
stuff
but
way
overpriced
of
course
nice
novelty
beer
d
the
biggest
deterrent
is
the
pricetag
but
one
hell
of
an
adventurous
beer
on
sam
adams
part
the
high
abv
makes
this
impossible
to
drink
in
large
quantities
but
when
savored
its
a
great
liver
warming
beer
overall
the
fancy
afterdinner
liqueur
for
the
beer
drinker
that
doesnt
like
liqueur
if
millennium
and
triple
bock
challenged
what
a
beer
could
be
utopias
downright
defies
it
is
it
the
ultimate
evolution
of
beer
or
is
it
just
a
snooty
pet
project
from
the
nutjobs
in
boston
does
it
really
matter
this
beer
is
awesome
and
thats
all
that
matters
grab
a
few
snifters
and
a
few
really
good
friends
and
enjoy
d
i
actually
like
this
one
of
course
its
more
reminiscent
of
a
fortified
wine
or
liqueur
than
a
regular
beer
but
thats
how
its
supposed
to
be
a
great
sipper
with
a
sophisticated
yet
cocky
character
for
being
so
high
in
alcohol
this
is
really
a
shockingly
smooth
beer
must
be
enjoyed
in
a
room
of
beer
lovers
because
this
is
intense
exploding
all
over
the
place
with
conversational
quality
first
huge
thanks
to
schulzy1
for
sharing
this
beast
pours
out
a
slightly
dark
caramel
color
and
immediately
the
aroma
fills
the
nose
maple
syrup
and
cognac
smells
taste
is
enthralling
notes
of
caramel
toffee
maple
syrup
and
alcohol
this
is
truly
a
wonderful
elixir
if
you
like
sweets
and
alcohol
you
will
like
this
but
first
you
have
to
get
it
simply
amazing
and
hard
to
believe
its
a
beer
also
this
one
is
a
sipper
d
hardly
drinkable
due
to
the
amount
of
heat
but
i
did
find
that
with
every
sip
i
took
the
next
one
came
quicker
think
a
beer
that
tastes
like
a
liquid
werthers
toffee
intertwining
complexities
and
profiles
seamlessly
and
balancing
the
liquorbeer
nicely
hard
to
make
a
a
beer
taste
like
a
beer
when
it
has
no
carbonation
that
mission
was
accomplished
here
enjoyed
on
new
years
eve
2005
deep
amber
and
copper
with
long
legs
and
burgandy
lips
the
aroma
presents
some
overwhelming
alcohol
with
maple
and
whisky
tons
of
maple
in
each
drink
oak
and
vanilla
you
can
feel
the
alcohol
evaportating
in
your
mouth
so
over
the
top
that
this
is
no
longer
beer
pours
medium
to
dark
brown
no
head
no
carbonation
pours
like
a
cognac
sticky
and
sweet
its
beautiful
the
way
it
coats
the
side
of
the
glass
aroma
is
pure
alcohol
can
hardly
smell
the
vanilla
and
chocolate
the
taste
is
sweet
and
delicious
taste
of
vanilla
chocolate
maple
raisin
aftertaste
is
a
nice
burn
as
it
goes
down
smooth
as
well
this
beer
will
fuck
you
up
drink
with
caution
drinkabilty
is
low
too
much
and
you
can
hurt
yourself
but
it
is
a
must
try
strong
maple
notes
both
in
smell
and
taste
tasted
like
a
port
fortified
with
maple
brandy
created
a
warming
sensation
as
it
traveled
down
the
esophagus
i
drank
it
out
of
the
utopias
glassware
that
came
with
the
bottle
it
had
a
slight
syrupy
consistency
that
coated
the
glass
d
good
alone
or
with
dessert
absolutely
worth
the
cost
it
has
earned
its
reputation
very
warming
good
for
the
winter
o
drinkability
is
low
due
to
high
abv
while
very
tasty
a
few
ounces
of
this
and
i
am
done
for
this
is
a
brew
best
shared
amongst
people
who
really
enjoy
craft
beer
and
not
for
thr
faint
of
heart
i
have
the
bottle
from
2006
and
still
tastes
unbelievable
and
actually
think
it
is
getting
better
with
age
highly
recommend
trying
this
beer
if
you
ever
get
the
opportunity
great
brew
also
had
the
pleasure
of
having
it
out
of
a
keg
bout
5
years
back
d
somehow
really
drinkable
had
a
2oz
sample
of
this
and
that
was
more
than
enough
then
i
had
another
2
oz
sample
the
warmer
this
gets
the
better
it
gets
just
an
amazing
beer
that
really
does
push
the
limits
of
what
beer
can
be
the
cellaring
potential
on
this
beer
is
off
the
charts
i
dont
think
it
will
ever
get
worse
this
beer
is
delicious
unfortunately
i
know
have
acquired
a
taste
for
a
beer
i
am
no
where
near
being
able
to
afford
drinkability
one
shot
of
this
is
enough
for
the
evening
the
sweetness
of
this
is
almost
too
much
this
one
pours
from
a
tupperware
container
to
my
glass
there
is
no
carbonation
but
it
sticks
to
the
glass
and
slowly
slides
back
down
the
smell
is
extremely
boozy
and
that
is
all
the
taste
is
nothing
like
beer
it
is
very
sweet
but
very
easy
to
drink
there
was
a
strong
alcohol
presence
but
not
in
a
bad
way
the
mouthfeel
was
sweet
and
smooth
not
sticky
as
it
was
in
the
glass
drinkability
was
horrible
for
a
beer
but
great
for
what
it
is
i
am
very
greatful
to
soulfly967
for
bringing
a
sample
over
im
not
even
sure
this
is
beer
anymore
but
it
tastes
amazing
if
it
wasnt
so
ridiculously
expensive
this
would
be
a
regular
feature
in
my
liquor
cabinet
i
was
a
little
skeptical
going
in
to
this
one
i
really
wanted
to
try
it
but
expected
something
boozy
and
very
obviously
not
beer
however
i
was
very
pleasantly
surprised
even
with
the
higher
alcohol
it
never
loses
its
beer
character
sure
there
are
comparisons
to
be
drawn
but
this
is
more
like
a
strong
finelyaged
barleywine
or
strong
ale
than
a
port
or
cognac
even
at
the
high
bottle
cost
i
honestly
want
a
bottle
of
this
so
i
can
just
spend
a
day
sipping
on
it
so
good
huge
thanks
go
out
to
mike
for
pulling
this
from
his
personal
stash
for
the
event
pours
a
crystal
clear
dark
amber
nice
honey
colour
no
head
and
no
lace
but
does
sport
some
pretty
insane
looking
legs
they
really
stick
all
over
the
glass
smell
is
amazing
and
intense
vanilla
honey
oak
toffee
nougat
insanely
malty
alcohol
grapes
figs
and
raisins
butterscotch
slightly
musty
maple
just
crazy
rich
and
intense
taste
is
the
same
mega
intense
wood
insane
amount
of
toffee
and
honey
brown
sugar
figs
raisins
vanilla
dark
fruit
maple
syrup
alcohol
just
has
everything
in
the
flavour
very
rich
and
malty
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
and
syrupy
low
carbonation
insanely
smooth
you
do
not
get
the
almost
26
alcohol
out
of
this
perfect
fireside
sipping
beer
id
replace
everything
of
that
sort
in
my
liquor
cabinet
for
this
stuff
just
amazing
and
im
really
happy
i
got
the
chance
to
try
this
perfect
for
what
it
is
need
to
get
me
some
2012
bottle
is
very
maple
syrup
liquor
im
sure
this
was
not
intended
to
consume
in
large
amounts
but
a
tasting
was
just
the
right
amount
it
went
done
smooth
and
just
seemed
to
slide
across
the
tongue
2007
bottle
number
08474
pours
a
beautiful
orangebrown
with
absolutely
not
a
trace
of
carbonation
this
is
more
like
a
fine
conaque
than
a
beer
sampled
along
side
by
side
with
hair
of
the
dog
dave
dave
being
happily
aged
for
14
years
was
mellow
and
welcoming
purring
like
a
cat
with
a
ton
of
complexity
the
young
unbehaved
2007
utopias
was
still
screaming
with
plenty
of
maple
syrup
spicy
fruits
and
a
whopping
of
alcohol
playing
haphazardly
on
the
tongue
the
2007
utopias
could
use
a
good
8
to
10
years
of
time
out
this
is
a
highly
addictive
drink
that
makes
you
pay
whatever
it
takes
on
ebay
to
satisfy
the
craving
for
more
i
am
saving
a
bottle
for
2017
and
another
bottle
for
2027
some
fuesel
alcohol
flavors
were
present
but
not
overwhelming
i
mean
what
do
you
expect
from
a
25
brew
drinkability
a
nice
after
dinner
sipper
but
something
to
spread
out
over
time
as
it
is
very
stable
a
nice
toast
to
end
christmas
2008
if
you
do
not
like
hard
liquors
you
will
most
likely
not
like
this
i
only
drink
beer
and
i
found
myself
having
a
really
hard
time
with
this
one
i
can
definitely
see
where
people
would
love
this
but
i
personally
would
not
go
out
of
my
way
to
have
it
again
because
it
is
more
of
a
hard
liquor
than
a
beer
drinkability
is
suprisingly
high
the
flavor
profile
is
spot
on
imo
and
quite
enjoyable
and
although
the
alcohol
is
very
apparent
its
an
important
aspect
to
this
beer
i
love
it
d
sip
this
one
and
enjoy
the
complexity
this
is
not
a
beer
by
conventional
definition
i
only
drank
about
4
oz
and
that
was
plenty
kept
me
warm
on
a
cold
winter
day
d
you
need
to
give
it
a
little
time
to
open
up
or
it
is
an
alcohol
mess
very
good
and
nice
to
see
some
breweries
especially
as
big
as
sam
adams
pushing
the
edge
on
beer
styles
this
is
interesting
to
try
but
it
fails
a
key
test
what
is
the
point
if
you
want
a
beer
have
a
beer
if
you
want
cognac
have
cognac
this
is
neither
and
therefore
will
satisfy
nobody
a
special
occasion
beerand
yes
this
is
beer
reminding
myself
of
that
as
i
sipped
helped
me
remember
1
the
almost
limitless
possibilities
of
the
brewing
process
and
2
the
talent
of
jim
koch
and
co
when
they
really
roll
their
sleeves
up
and
get
to
it
this
is
a
far
sight
better
than
their
triple
bockdont
even
compare
the
two
even
if
its
tempting
to
do
so
thanks
again
greg
thanks
to
jim
koch
and
everyone
at
sam
adams
this
is
something
truely
unique
i
had
the
pleasure
to
taste
this
at
yesterdays
gabf
evening
session
i
was
much
more
impressed
than
i
thought
i
would
be
as
it
leaves
a
very
pleasant
maple
and
vanilla
taste
on
your
palate
and
although
very
alcoholic
it
had
only
subtle
hits
of
its
true
abv
you
do
have
some
oak
and
sherry
notes
that
come
through
as
well
it
has
a
very
thick
mouth
feel
and
no
carbonation
this
is
truly
a
great
beer
that
can
be
appreciated
by
any
beer
advocate
this
pours
a
dark
redburgundy
with
no
head
at
all
its
served
still
looks
thicker
and
almost
syrupy
compared
to
any
other
beer
ever
smells
of
cognac
port
wine
alcohol
and
maple
tastes
like
it
smells
lots
of
alcohol
in
there
this
one
is
a
sipper
for
sure
sweet
sticky
mouthfeel
with
a
slight
alcohol
burn
and
a
thick
body
this
is
one
of
those
brews
that
truly
breaks
ground
great
brew
that
really
is
outside
the
box
i
wish
i
could
afford
to
drink
this
more
often
overall
im
glad
i
had
a
chance
to
try
this
its
very
interesting
somehow
it
still
resembles
a
beer
definitely
worth
a
try
poured
a
syrupy
dark
amber
with
no
carbonation
smelt
of
condensed
maple
alcohol
and
molasses
taste
was
pure
maple
molasses
and
a
smooth
alcohol
burn
truly
unique
and
amazing
i
would
recommend
all
bas
try
this
at
least
once
i
know
i
will
be
getting
a
bottle
of
the
next
release
i
could
see
how
this
wouldnt
be
everyones
cup
of
tea
and
it
certainly
isnt
drinkable
in
the
slightest
but
really
wonderful
to
try
pours
a
beutiful
golden
brown
into
a
tiny
brandy
snifter
to
capture
the
aroma
it
looks
more
like
liquor
then
beer
and
the
nose
is
off
the
charts
and
clearly
more
developed
then
the
07
malt
port
caramel
dates
seriously
every
other
time
i
lifted
this
to
my
lips
just
inhaling
the
delicious
aroma
was
enough
and
the
flavor
a
drop
on
the
tongue
spreads
throughout
the
mouth
a
delcious
complicated
hoppy
malty
caramel
magic
being
stranded
on
a
desert
island
would
be
worth
it
if
a
bottle
of
this
was
along
i
thought
this
beer
would
be
all
hype
but
it
was
worth
every
dollar
i
was
able
to
sample
a
1
oz
pour
of
this
at
downtown
bar
grill
in
brooklyn
it
was
a
nice
dark
bronzecopper
color
with
no
head
or
lacing
as
expected
a
very
nice
aroma
with
some
sweet
smells
and
vanilly
the
flavor
was
very
smooth
which
matched
the
aromas
and
you
could
taste
the
alcohol
it
very
much
reminded
me
of
a
tawny
port
in
both
smell
and
taste
the
mouthfeel
was
very
smooth
and
syrupy
even
at
the
price
this
is
one
that
i
would
love
to
pick
up
a
bottle
of
and
slowly
savor
its
definitely
a
sipper
this
is
a
pretty
brew
flat
yes
but
pretty
nonetheless
dark
reddish
amber
and
very
cognaclike
in
appearance
how
can
one
turn
away
the
aromas
jump
out
at
you
whilst
you
take
in
the
colour
of
this
brew
yes
they
are
that
strong
and
seem
to
shout
things
like
alcohol
sugar
raisins
sherry
port
cognac
malts
and
plums
the
taste
is
burning
and
singing
with
alcohol
but
in
a
good
way
like
a
fine
strong
port
or
a
nice
french
cognac
the
taste
is
all
alcohol
molasses
other
sugars
dark
fruits
nuts
syrups
and
more
truly
a
beer
to
behold
mouthfeel
is
liquorlike
and
coating
and
the
drinkability
is
actually
quite
good
for
a
beer
that
you
drink
by
the
shot
or
snifter
truly
a
oneofakind
brew
i
hope
every
ba
gets
to
try
this
www

drinkability
sip
all
night
long
great
for
breaking
out
for
celebrations
like
when
the
giants
won
the
super
bowl
tasted
at
room
temperature
out
of
a
snifter
its
slightly
thick
and
syrupy
with
a
pleasant
mouth
feel
its
sweet
and
warming
with
flavors
of
maple
vanilla
oak
and
caramel
its
a
wholly
unique
experience
it
doesnt
taste
much
like
beer
or
for
that
matter
scotch
or
anything
else
absolutely
worth
trying
and
worth
the
price
but
not
the
sort
of
thing
id
want
to
regularly
indulge
in
overall
this
was
really
unlike
anything
i
had
before
it
is
in
a
class
of
its
own
as
it
should
be
and
something
that
everyone
should
get
to
try
for
120
00
i
would
buy
a
bottle
with
no
issues
asked
i
would
love
to
have
this
one
sitting
around
waiting
for
me
every
night
this
is
a
def
must
try
a
holy
grail
of
beer
if
you
will
enough
said
i
wish
i
could
put
this
on
waffles
overall
drop
all
preconceived
notions
of
beer
when
tasting
this
treat
it
as
you
would
any
hard
liquor
of
your
choice
youll
be
fine
though
i
probably
wont
splurge
120
on
a
bottle
i
definitely
love
this
brew
was
very
fortunate
to
have
had
the
opportunity
to
try
it
you
should
try
this
at
least
once
quite
a
while
ago
i
had
the
unfortunate
experience
of
trying
over
and
over
again
to
like
sam
adams
triple
bock
i
tried
multiple
bottles
both
fresh
and
aged
over
5
years
none
of
them
worked
for
me
i
could
never
get
over
the
taste
of
soy
sauce
and
dead
yeast
happily
this
attempt
at
creating
a
super
strong
beer
fares
much
better
first
off
the
bottle
is
beautiful
i
love
the
copper
sheathing
the
pour
itselff
looks
like
a
cognac
or
something
but
slightly
more
viscous
no
head
at
all
but
excellent
clarity
and
it
sticks
to
the
glass
the
aromas
are
not
at
all
beer
like
instead
i
get
maple
sweetened
brandy
but
nicely
balanced
and
not
too
sweet
the
taste
is
even
nicer
for
what
it
is
long
brandy
like
heat
but
fairly
smooth
and
tempered
somewhat
by
cleantasting
relatively
dry
maple
syrup
flavors
and
some
vinous
qualities
extremely
smooth
in
the
mouth
and
although
surprisingly
dry
the
sweetness
and
feeling
of
alcohol
build
as
you
drink
and
necessitate
only
having
a
single
small
pour
very
interesting
and
very
much
a
beer
digestif
drinkability
a
super
slow
sipper
for
sure
and
one
thats
made
even
more
enjoyable
when
you
werent
the
one
who
actually
paid
for
the
bottle
drinkability
well
theres
no
way
i
could
drink
more
than
a
couple
ounces
of
this
at
a
time
but
its
definitely
tasty
i
am
a
fan
of
a
nice
whiskey
over
a
couple
cubes
and
this
was
sort
of
in
the
same
breath
im
sure
it
was
more
of
a
cognac
or
brandy
but
i
dont
drink
that
stuff
pretty
darn
good
and
big
thanks
again
to
greg
i
am
amazed
that
this
bottle
cost
160
and
a
bottle
of
120
is
only
10
it
is
a
great
beer
experiment
but
the
beer
obviously
taken
on
alcohol
from
the
whiskey
d
this
is
a
sipper
at
a
couple
of
ounces
at
a
time
this
makes
for
a
wonderful
after
dinner
or
before
bead
treat
i
doubt
much
more
than
a
few
ounces
in
any
one
setting
would
be
able
to
be
appreciated
this
was
quite
an
exceptional
treat
to
sample
its
technically
a
beer
although
its
characteristics
are
more
like
a
scotch
or
cognac
it
poured
a
clear
dark
copper
with
no
head
it
had
an
extremely
strong
and
complex
scent
of
brown
sugar
malt
cinnamon
sugar
wheat
and
alcohol
its
flavor
was
even
stronger
blending
super
sweet
honey
maple
syrup
hazel
nut
refined
wheat
and
delicate
malt
it
was
oily
and
very
smooth
with
no
carbonation
and
a
very
strong
and
lasting
aftertaste
of
bitterness
and
alcohol
warming
overall
this
was
just
about
perfect
one
of
the
best
alcoholic
beverages
of
any
sort
that
ive
tried
it
was
very
simple
at
first
but
the
more
you
thought
about
it
the
more
complex
it
became
it
had
chameleonlike
characteristics
in
that
you
could
discern
hints
of
practically
any
flavor
you
thought
about
despite
the
ridiculous
price
tag
this
is
worth
it
this
could
easily
be
called
a
cognac
or
several
other
different
types
of
hard
alcohol
tasted
much
better
than
their
triple
bock
even
though
it
was
much
stronger
cannot
imagine
what
hair
of
the
dog
dave
tastes
like
it
has
three
or
four
percent
abv
on
this
one
only
twelve
thousand
bottles
of
this
worldwide
aged
in
four
different
barrels
throughout
the
year
it
is
brewed
lots
of
time
and
effort
go
into
making
this
rarity
truly
one
of
the
most
unique
beers
i
will
ever
have
glad
i
tried
it
even
though
it
was
the
most
expensive
couple
ounces
of
beer
i
will
probably
ever
have
recommended
if
you
do
not
mind
pulling
out
the
credit
card
overall
it
was
fun
to
finally
try
this
beer
with
koch
as
my
bartender
it
was
interesting
and
complex
a
strongold
ale
type
beer
with
massive
alcohol
the
most
impressive
thing
about
it
was
the
drinkability
was
i
blown
away
no
would
i
pay
125
for
it
no
but
id
definitely
drink
it
again
for
free
overall
i
managed
to
find
a
bar
that
was
offering
the
2
oz
shots
of
this
im
glad
i
paid
the
money
i
did
for
the
shot
but
im
also
glad
i
didnt
buy
the
whole
bottle
at
a
store
in
that
end
id
recommend
it
but
only
to
those
who
seriously
like
the
high
gravity
barley
wine
style
beers
or
port
or
whiskey
d
the
only
thing
that
will
keep
you
from
having
another
is
if
youre
buddy
owns
the
bottle
and
wont
part
with
any
more
2
maybe
3
short
glasses
of
this
will
suffice
i
see
what
all
the
fuss
is
about
good
and
calling
this
an
extreme
beer
is
a
good
thing
drinkability
is
diminished
purely
of
the
alcohol
content
sip
dont
rip
it
enjoy
just
like
a
cognac
d
i
think
it
is
really
good
but
not
easy
to
drink
it
is
more
like
a
hard
alcohol
instead
of
a
beer
of
course
i
doubt
i
would
spend
150
on
a
bottle
but
to
try
a
ounce
of
it
like
i
have
it
is
good
this
was
one
of
best
christmas
presents
ever
and
it
took
me
until
now
to
drink
it
i
first
had
it
a
couple
years
ago
at
sam
adams
beer
dinner
i
would
highly
recommend
everyone
try
it
at
least
once
a
couple
ounces
is
more
than
enough
i
was
lucky
enough
to
receive
this
as
a
gift
from
my
wife
for
christmas
i
was
so
anxious
to
try
this
beer
that
i
was
almost
nervous
i
figured
for
the
price
this
beer
must
be
something
special
the
first
thing
to
hit
me
was
the
smell
after
opening
the
bottle
it
smelled
strong
of
alcohol
oak
and
a
sort
of
molasses
sweetness
poured
out
with
no
carbonation
but
still
looked
nice
in
the
utopias
snifter
the
color
was
of
a
deep
copper
the
taste
was
smooth
in
comparison
to
ports
and
cognacs
it
definitely
cant
be
compared
to
most
other
beers
there
are
notes
of
oak
burnt
caramel
vanilla
and
fruits
but
none
of
them
overwhelm
eachother
part
of
the
enjoyment
of
this
beer
probably
comes
from
the
experience
of
drinking
a
beer
that
is
more
expensive
than
a
lot
of
fine
wines
and
spirits
athough
it
is
smooth
this
beer
is
definitely
a
sipper
two
ounces
is
just
enough
to
make
each
tasting
special
if
you
can
find
a
bottle
or
a
bar
that
will
sell
it
by
2
ounce
shots
taste
it
youll
be
drinking
a
part
of
new
beer
history
after
recently
having
the
past
five
vintages
of
the
beer
its
quite
obvious
that
these
beers
get
better
and
better
with
each
subsequent
release
even
as
earlier
versions
are
lesser
in
alcohol
they
portray
an
overall
rougher
alcohol
taste
the
more
recent
versions
are
smoother
stronger
and
more
sophisticated
in
taste
and
yes
worth
every
penny
no
head
and
no
carbonation
more
like
cognac
than
a
beer
this
is
a
great
winter
after
dinner
beer
its
20f
out
tonight
and
this
seemes
like
an
apropreate
beer
taste
is
burnt
caramel
honey
and
maple
i
dont
taste
any
hops
this
is
a
great
beer
but
its
just
to
expensive
i
dont
think
i
will
buy
it
again
jim
koch
i
tip
my
hat
to
you
or
would
if
i
had
one
dnot
an
all
night
drinker
but
i
would
have
more
than
one
for
a
very
special
occasion
try
this
if
you
get
the
chance
you
will
not
be
let
down
overall
an
exceptional
beerliquor
well
worth
the
money
for
me
to
try
once
in
my
life
and
exceptional
to
sip
on
will
definitely
consider
purchasing
another
one
if
i
can
ever
get
my
hands
on
it
overall
i
am
honored
to
have
a
bottle
of
this
on
hand
to
sip
as
i
please
i
drank
it
as
the
colts
game
finished
and
it
was
a
great
way
to
end
a
wonderful
day
of
drinking
wonderful
brews
i
look
forward
to
future
occasions
when
i
will
sample
this
one
because
it
is
a
wonderful
and
ultra
unique
brew
that
in
my
opinion
is
worth
the
high
price
tag
well
when
i
first
heard
of
utopias
i
knew
that
i
would
have
it
one
day
how
does
one
even
begin
to
categorize
or
rate
with
numbers
something
that
is
nothing
like
anything
else
ever
made
i
would
recommend
to
every
beer
fanatic
a
taste
of
this
at
all
costs
this
will
absolutely
change
your
perception
of
what
beer
can
be
its
much
more
like
a
port
or
scotch
than
a
beer
of
course
its
amazing
im
not
really
sure
how
to
rate
this
beer
as
it
is
so
different
as
to
preclude
it
from
being
compared
against
any
conventional
beers
but
ill
give
it
a
shot
i
poured
a
1
oz
sample
into
my
utopias
glass
that
came
free
with
the
purchase
of
the
bottle
color
is
a
clear
burnt
orange
with
hints
of
amber
and
ruby
as
it
is
flat
there
is
no
head
swirling
reveals
legs
on
the
side
of
the
glass
as
you
get
with
fine
wines
and
cognacs
swirling
also
exposes
the
intense
aromas
of
vanilla
maple
and
brown
sugar
these
come
out
in
the
flavor
as
well
with
an
intense
sweetness
and
a
warming
alcohol
sense
as
it
goes
down
given
the
sweetness
strength
and
most
importantly
the
cost
i
would
not
want
to
drink
more
than
1
of
these
in
a
given
evening
which
is
why
i
gave
a
low
score
for
drinkability
overall
its
a
nice
novelty
but
not
really
what
i
look
for
in
an
alcoholic
beverage
and
the
cost
is
staggeringly
high
at
150
per
25
oz
bottle
roughly
6
per
once
still
very
good
and
i
did
get
it
for
original
150
dollar
price
i
did
buy
a
couple
more
bottles
to
cellar
and
i
cant
wait
to
taste
how
they
are
in
a
few
years
i
didnt
think
this
could
live
up
to
the
hype
but
it
did
for
me
ill
admit
that
i
am
a
port
fan
as
well
so
i
already
enjoy
a
lot
of
the
flavors
and
feel
that
utopias
brings
to
the
table
d
obviously
not
an
all
night
drinker
but
i
will
have
as
much
as
i
can
try
this
if
you
get
the
chance
you
will
not
be
let
down
if
one
likes
scotch
or
whiskey
im
sure
they
would
love
to
give
this
a
try
it
is
definitely
a
sipper
but
i
am
not
sure
how
much
i
couldnt
drink
very
much
of
this
at
all
it
was
fun
to
have
but
i
dont
see
myself
because
of
the
hefty
price
buying
a
bottle
anytime
soon
considering
the
alcohol
level
this
is
very
very
drinkable
but
only
by
way
of
sipping
id
love
to
have
a
bottle
of
this
so
i
could
pour
a
significant
helping
into
a
snifter
and
just
slowly
revel
in
the
sweetness
and
warmth
on
a
cold
winter
night
i
came
in
to
the
tasting
skeptical
of
whether
this
could
really
be
a
worthwhile
brew
i
left
blown
away
i
could
easily
drink
this
every
night
in
place
of
a
good
port
were
it
not
so
costprohibitive
simply
put
excellent
i
was
all
about
this
with
the
2005
version
i
mean
really
talked
this
up
to
friends
who
themselves
loved
it
however
this
version
was
a
real
disappointment
flavor
was
consumed
by
the
alcohol
in
this
batch
someone
told
me
that
this
version
tastes
like
a
cheap
port
after
having
this
i
would
have
to
agree
dont
get
me
wrong
i
loved
the
2005
version
i
paid
a
grip
of
money
to
get
that
version
and
felt
it
was
money
well
spent
this
version
really
bummed
me
out
i
may
be
wary
of
future
vintages
from
now
on
i
would
say
taste
this
if
you
can
before
you
buy
ok
wow
what
an
amazing
beer
knowing
its
rarity
and
its
tendency
to
be
gone
quickly
at
the
gabf
my
buddies
and
i
shot
straight
for
the
sam
adams
booth
and
this
was
our
first
beer
of
the
day
and
by
far
the
best
this
beer
is
obviously
big
but
its
complexity
is
amazing
theres
very
little
carbonation
but
the
mouth
feel
is
excellent
its
very
sweet
but
not
overwhelmingly
so
it
was
like
liquid
candy
loved
it
sampling
utopias
was
definitely
a
unique
experience
i
would
definitely
spend
the
14
again
to
do
so
congratulations
to
sam
adams
for
not
only
brewing
the
strongest
beer
in
the
world
but
doing
so
with
style
and
flair
d
a
great
drink
to
be
enjoyed
slowly
after
dinner
a
good
substitute
for
a
port
sherry
scotch
bourbon
cognac
etc
however
it
is
definitely
expensive
and
if
that
were
not
caused
by
its
limited
availability
i
would
say
it
costs
too
much
for
what
it
is
definitly
a
sipper
a
good
beer
but
not
worth
100
a
bottle
imo
how
could
a
25
abv
beer
be
any
more
drinkable
this
beer
is
definetly
a
sipper
but
considering
its
25
alcohol
its
a
damn
drinkable
beer
the
pour
is
a
clear
copper
color
with
no
carbonation
and
thick
streaming
legs
on
the
glass
as
you
swirl
it
the
nose
is
very
warm
and
nutty
with
a
lot
of
maple
the
flavor
has
hazelnuts
vanilla
caramel
figs
and
maple
that
finishes
pretty
hot
but
not
as
hot
as
you
would
think
it
defiantly
is
more
like
a
port
wine
than
a
beer
worth
a
try
if
you
can
get
it
shared
a
bottle
of
this
last
night
at
bodega
brew
pub
downtown
la
crosse
wisconsin
poured
with
a
lovely
redish
amber
color
very
aromatic
with
sherry
caramel
walnuts
and
hints
of
oak
rum
vanilla
and
brandy
taste
was
the
same
but
thick
with
sweetness
great
finish
satisfying
and
so
rich
key
points
are
maple
drinkable
and
delicious
perfect
for
a
cigar
worth
the
money
hell
yeah
but
im
still
not
gonna
buy
one
cheers
well
done
thanks
go
to
blitheringidiot
for
sharing
this
rare
treat
2005
vintage
06370
poured
into
a
small
snifter
glass
appears
a
beautiful
clear
amber
red
with
zero
head
carbonation
and
lacing
smells
of
butterscotch
vanilla
and
brandy
tastes
of
butterscotch
sweet
brown
sugar
molasses
vanilla
practically
defines
the
word
smooth
buttery
mouthfeel
and
like
i
said
no
carbonation
at
all
what
an
amazing
wonderful
beer
the
perfect
celebration
drink
for
a
beer
lover
i
am
grateful
i
had
the
chance
to
sample
this
extraordinary
brew
thanks
to
jim
koch
for
putting
this
out
there
excellent
job
bbc
update
had
a
glass
on
nye
2012
and
must
say
with
developed
beer
taste
buds
this
is
exceptional
mindblowing
so
much
better
than
i
remember
its
hardly
a
beerlike
but
wow
it
sure
is
wonderful
glad
i
had
a
chance
to
try
it
finally
found
my
notes
for
this
one
one
of
those
legendry
beers
that
mostly
lives
up
to
its
name
into
a
snifter
glass
pours
black
viscous
no
head
no
lacing
no
carbonation
just
a
thick
black
liquid
looks
dangerous
aroma
is
strong
and
i
mean
strong
heavily
bourbon
vanilla
heavy
fruits
maybe
some
oak
in
there
if
i
can
sort
it
from
the
bourbon
very
intoxicating
delicious
taste
is
on
the
verge
of
overpowering
cant
imagine
going
more
than
a
snifter
full
of
it
mirroring
aroma
heavy
on
the
bourbon
really
more
like
hard
alcohol
than
beer
complex
and
fierce
but
refined
in
every
sense
of
the
word
smooth
and
warm
in
the
mouth
this
beer
is
the
answer
to
all
those
boston
brewco
bashers
like
the
jaguar
wing
of
fordco
rich
satiating
a
true
sipper
my
utopias
was
a
2003
i
dont
know
what
the
other
people
on
this
sight
are
talking
about
with
their
utopias
mmii
and
mmiii
because
they
are
not
listed
that
way
on
the
boston
brewing
company
websight
anyway
i
was
lucky
enough
to
come
across
a
bottle
of
this
stuff
for
free
oh
but
it
was
no
accident
by
the
way
so
it
poured
a
nice
copper
with
no
head
not
carbonated
smelled
and
tasted
at
first
like
a
cross
between
tawny
port
and
single
barrel
bourbon
repeated
tastings
narrowed
it
down
to
a
monster
strength
j
w
lees
harvest
ale
or
a
10
year
tawny
but
with
more
burn
i
shared
this
out
with
five
other
friends
we
had
all
we
wanted
and
dumped
the
rest
out
the
window
not
kidding
it
was
free
and
we
had
our
fill
it
tasted
marvelous
for
a
beer
but
just
standard
for
a
good
tawny
port
i
bought
for
a
quarter
of
what
this
thing
originally
retailed
for
why
go
out
of
your
way
to
pay
120
bucks
for
something
that
tastes
like
a
good
35
dollar
bottle
of
port
oh
because
it
was
free
for
me
thats
why
still
an
amazing
beer
drinkability
try
it
if
you
get
the
chance
i
would
again
but
this
is
not
a
beer
one
drinks
on
a
daily
basis
definately
something
special
drinkabilityoverall
an
amazing
experience
that
i
am
glad
to
have
had
a
chance
to
partake
in
truly
blurs
the
line
between
beer
and
spirits
distinct
and
refined
this
is
the
sipper
of
all
sippers
worth
the
money
for
a
bottle
not
for
a
starving
college
student
like
me
unless
i
won
the
lottery
wherein
this
would
become
a
staple
in
my
liquor
cabinet
now
ive
heard
people
say
whoever
spends
106
or
now
150
on
a
bottle
of
beer
is
crazy
well
they
may
be
right
but
ya
know
what
i
worked
hard
for
that
money
i
spent
on
this
beer
it
is
like
no
other
beer
ive
ever
had
or
will
have
in
my
life
unless
i
get
another
bottle
which
is
definately
not
out
of
the
question
its
an
experience
some
people
go
to
strip
clubs
and
drop
500night
for
something
they
wont
remember
the
next
day
i
spent
106
on
something
ill
remember
for
rhe
rest
of
my
life
personally
i
think
its
worth
it
i
like
how
sam
adams
can
still
demonstrate
a
huge
set
of
balls
when
they
want
to
dark
amber
pour
with
zero
head
immediately
after
smelling
the
question
arises
is
this
beer
or
sherry
smells
like
a
good
oloroso
sherry
with
aromas
of
dried
apricot
burnt
sugar
vanilla
prune
maple
hazelnuts
the
flavours
on
the
palate
follow
through
with
a
little
more
of
a
boubon
overtone
and
more
than
a
little
heat
on
the
finish
absolutley
fascinating
much
thanks
to
hero27
for
graciously
sharing
sippable
and
enjoyable
i
would
enjoy
more
of
this
if
it
was
free
again
dark
dark
dark
no
head
but
with
high
abv
who
cares
smell
had
distinct
bourbon
notes
this
has
the
texture
of
an
after
dinner
drink
syrupy
smooth
alcohol
but
with
a
malt
kick
naturally
with
a
syrupy
quality
the
mouthfeel
is
chewy
mmmm
natgurally
this
is
a
sipper
smooth
for
the
extreme
abv
evereyone
should
try
this
at
least
once
in
their
beer
tasting
lifetime
it
is
very
similar
to
a
fine
brandy
cognac
or
even
scotch
in
the
way
that
it
is
sipped
slowly
and
for
longer
duration
of
time
i
find
it
difficult
calling
this
a
beer
but
as
it
is
i
would
highly
recommend
trying
this
if
the
opportunity
comes
your
way
a
final
note
i
can
only
assume
that
the
cask
conditioned
sample
i
had
yesterday
would
be
completely
different
from
a
bottled
sample
sampled
from
a
cognac
like
pour
at
the
sunset
grill
and
tap
in
allston
massachusetts
copper
colored
with
no
head
the
nose
is
sharp
and
extremely
alcoholic
if
you
take
a
big
sniff
very
close
to
the
glass
but
if
you
sniff
from
a
bit
further
away
and
use
the
wafting
method
an
unbelievable
range
of
aromas
comes
about
including
caramel
vanilla
mocha
maple
and
hazelnut
rich
diverse
range
of
flavors
very
similar
to
the
aromatic
descriptors
above
the
alcohol
is
huge
but
i
didnt
find
it
overwhelming
in
any
way
but
well
hidden
i
got
the
privelege
of
bringing
a
bottle
to
a
rather
high
end
tailgate
party
this
past
fall
yeah
i
know
its
150
and
that
scares
a
lot
of
people
but
they
only
make
8000
bottles
for
the
entire
world
it
comes
out
once
a
year
and
its
25
abv
it
pours
goldenamber
brownish
with
a
light
ring
around
the
top
this
beer
drinks
more
like
a
port
or
fine
cognac
with
a
certain
level
of
burn
on
the
lengthy
finish
a
real
treat
if
you
ever
get
the
chance
i
was
bracing
for
a
sharp
alcohol
bite
but
didnt
get
one
it
started
to
bite
but
the
maple
and
caramel
flavors
covered
it
well
very
sweet
kinda
smokey
seems
like
a
cross
between
a
tawny
port
and
scotch
maybe
a
little
thicker
couldnt
drink
more
than
about
2
oz
bottle
comes
with
a
screw
top
so
it
will
keep
for
a
while
i
have
been
looking
forward
to
trying
this
beer
for
a
long
long
time
and
finally
had
the
chance
recently
pours
a
golden
color
with
no
carbonation
to
be
seen
anywhere
the
aroma
is
very
alcoholic
but
lends
way
to
something
that
reminds
me
of
a
tawny
port
very
strong
vanilla
cherry
and
some
wood
character
extremely
complex
the
flavor
has
all
kinds
of
stuff
going
on
starts
out
with
a
caramel
and
cherry
thing
then
melds
with
the
vanilla
the
alcohol
is
obvious
but
its
not
overbearing
like
i
expected
this
beer
is
extremely
easy
to
drink
surprisingly
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
the
drinkability
is
surprisingly
good
for
such
a
high
abv
mouthfeel
is
smooth
slick
and
sweet
its
25
abv
but
theres
no
harsh
alcohol
burn
to
be
found
here
making
it
easy
to
swirl
it
around
your
mouth
and
really
enjoy
the
flavors
of
each
sip
this
is
really
quite
tasty
and
an
enlightening
experience
to
show
just
how
far
the
limits
of
beer
can
be
pushed
the
high
price
tag
will
keep
me
away
for
now
but
maybe
someday
ill
be
able
to
snag
a
whole
bottle
of
this
for
myself
kudos
to
jim
koch
and
sam
adams
for
pushing
the
limits
and
thanks
to
blitheringidiot
as
well
for
giving
me
the
opportunity
to
enjoy
this
rare
treat
drinkability
is
surprisingly
high
for
me
id
probably
buy
a
bottle
if
i
could
find
one
around
here
ohio
doesnt
sell
beer
above
10
percent
or
so
i
was
glad
to
have
the
opportunity
to
try
this
at
the
brewery
free
no
less
and
if
i
had
the
extra
id
get
myself
a
bottle
for
now
though
ill
content
myself
with
memories
of
this
incredible
brew
drinkability
excellent
as
a
novelty
beer
try
the
strongest
beer
in
the
world
treated
like
a
scotch
this
is
one
ale
to
savor
as
the
flavors
and
aromas
have
never
been
repeated
in
my
experience
overall
im
glad
i
got
to
try
this
but
i
dont
think
i
would
ever
want
to
buy
it
25
for
a
entry
fee
beats
150
for
a
bottle
any
day
in
comparison
is
far
better
and
more
drinkable
than
the
other
strong
beers
ive
tried
such
as
dogfishs
wws
and
120
ipa
or
sams
triple
bock
setting
the
record
for
alcohol
content
while
making
an
enjoyable
sipper
have
to
call
this
one
an
unqualified
success
im
going
to
let
the
rest
of
ths
elixir
sit
right
where
it
is
until
christmas
next
year
the
taste
is
sweet
but
not
overly
so
and
has
a
concentrated
maltiness
to
it
there
are
also
flavor
notes
reminiscent
of
molasses
and
maple
syrup
here
the
finish
at
times
is
dominated
by
hot
alcohol
notes
that
make
the
finish
reminiscent
of
rum
actually
the
more
i
think
of
it
the
more
apt
the
rum
analogy
is
there
are
lots
of
molasses
and
fermented
cane
flavor
type
notes
here
the
flavors
are
so
concentrated
that
they
are
almost
overwhelming
some
of
the
notes
i
cant
seem
to
pick
out
i
do
get
notes
of
vanilla
lots
of
caramel
and
toffee
brittle
last
swigs
is
this
worth
the
price
no
is
jim
k
a
genius
at
marketing
this
stuff
yes
props
goes
to
jim
k
he
made
a
good
awlkeehawl
beer
and
people
actually
are
stupid
enough
to
shell
out
100
ducats
to
taste
it
what
a
belly
holding
laff
should
you
seek
this
naw
but
if
it
falls
in
your
lap
check
it
if
you
have
money
burning
a
hole
in
your
pocket
and
can
find
this
great
brew
id
say
go
for
it
you
can
always
split
the
cost
with
a
few
friends
like
i
did
that
way
you
wont
feel
so
guilty
when
youre
staring
at
the
gorgeous
empty
bottle
pours
without
a
head
and
no
lace
crystal
clear
deep
amber
color
no
carbonation
and
heavy
bodied
nose
is
a
strong
alcohol
starts
sweet
with
serious
alcohol
overtones
taste
is
a
cognacbrandy
lingering
alcohol
aftertaste
is
this
a
beer
and
how
can
you
compare
to
others
its
bottle
1776
for
me
very
expensive
and
really
dfh
world
wide
stout
1823
abv
at
7
95
tastes
more
like
a
beer
100
for
24oz
bottle
from
tullys
beer
wine
wells
me
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
you
can
sip
and
ponder
life
a
hundred
bucks
for
a
bottle
is
something
you
spend
on
wine
usually
but
i
am
sure
glad
someone
else
out
there
was
willing
to
spend
it
for
me
drinkabilityconsidering
the
alcohol
content
it
was
surprisingly
drinkable
you
could
taste
the
alcohol
so
if
you
dont
like
hard
liquor
you
may
not
like
this
as
mentioned
before
this
is
not
a
session
beer
the
label
describes
the
best
way
to
drink
it
and
think
it
is
accurate
room
temperature
we
chilled
it
too
and
i
preferred
it
chilled
in
small
1
or
2
oz
portions
how
many
samples
of
this
did
i
drink
at
the
jom
koch
lead
tour
at
bbc
in
jp
at
least
4
or
5
why
cause
it
was
unbelievably
tasty
normally
i
shy
away
from
these
huge
alcohol
beers
but
this
was
surprisingly
drinkable
where
do
we
start
first
it
looks
like
cognac
in
the
glass
good
start
secondly
while
the
alcohol
is
very
very
evident
in
the
aroma
my
impression
was
of
a
good
reposada
tequila
some
spice
maybe
some
cinnamon
definitely
enticing
tastewise
it
is
surprisingly
sweet
aka
no
alcohol
burn
which
is
why
i
was
able
to
drink
so
many
samples
a
very
smooth
drinking
beer
theres
a
lot
of
different
angles
of
sweetness
here
maple
syrup
brown
sugar
molasses
even
fruit
sweetness
from
raisins
add
a
bit
of
butterscotch
in
the
finish
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
and
kudos
to
bbc
for
this
tasty
sipping
brew
this
beer
can
simply
be
had
no
other
way
than
sipping
the
3oz
i
had
was
enough
to
enjoy
and
a
good
albiet
very
different
beer
pretty
color
from
what
i
could
see
it
was
a
small
sample
and
smelled
of
maple
vanilla
sherryy
you
can
smell
the
alcohol
but
its
not
overpowering
taste
is
amazing
cognac
comes
to
mind
sweet
but
not
too
sweet
the
alcohol
was
sneaky
and
warming
i
expected
to
be
gagging
and
coughing
after
one
sip
but
i
found
myself
really
enjoying
it
i
sipped
and
savored
couldnt
do
too
much
of
this
like
cognac
but
i
enjoyed
my
little
snifter
of
it
i
would
have
it
again
cerainly
for
free
of
course
if
you
ever
see
it
around
i
would
pick
up
a
bottle
at
180
i
know
its
rough
for
special
occasions
sherry
is
the
flavor
that
dominates
here
but
lets
break
it
down
a
little
roasty
caramel
vanilla
hints
of
black
currant
and
oak
alcohol
is
a
bit
pronounced
but
not
as
much
as
i
would
have
expected
this
beer
is
refined
and
sophisticated
not
rough
lightly
sticky
in
the
mouth
with
a
dry
finish
a
sipper
to
be
sure
but
a
tasty
one
drinkability
just
a
bit
of
this
was
good
enough
for
me
good
stuff
best
had
as
an
after
dinner
aperatif
thanks
pete
for
the
chance
to
try
this
wonderful
brew
i
think
a
snifter
of
this
was
gonna
be
10
or
12
so
i
opted
to
get
a
dollar
or
two
sample
of
it
im
glad
i
did
while
this
beer
has
an
awesome
heat
id
expect
from
a
strong
ale
and
a
super
nice
fresh
hoppiness
and
also
some
solid
balance
the
price
is
just
kind
of
crazy
to
me
especially
since
its
not
even
barrelaged
or
anything
if
this
were
a
bit
cheaper
id
probably
score
it
higher
as
unfair
as
that
probably
is
i
really
do
like
the
taste
of
this
one
though
it
just
doesnt
warrant
the
price
tag
fresh
hops
warming
alcohol
nice
combo
of
both
sweet
and
bitter
pretty
nice
beer
3rd
of
the
night
after
ravens
loss
slight
step
behind
sawtooth
but
next
time
will
try
side
by
side
just
to
be
sure
aroma
is
malts
fruit
toffee
and
leather
the
flavor
is
fruit
malts
toffee
slightly
coarse
texture
slight
liquor
notes
mild
alcohol
and
a
tangysour
finish
intentionally
the
opposite
of
smooth
overall
a
pretty
good
american
strong
ale
if
maybe
a
little
rough
round
the
edges
definitely
worth
a
try
though
overall
4
comes
across
as
an
aggressively
hopped
english
strong
ale
quite
tasty
and
decadent
even
if
it
is
a
little
rough
overall
frankly
a
little
disappointed
from
an
admittedly
spoiled
beer
lover
maybe
a
bad
bottle
maybe
it
needs
some
age
overall
this
is
tasty

tasting
glass
tasted
july
2014
purchased
at
costco
back
after
a
long
hiatus
this
is
essentially
double
sawtooth
ale
so
a
double
esb
and
i
think
its
wonderful
rich
and
more
american
than
english
on
the
hop
front
but
with
a
real
sturdy
and
classic
english
malt
base
the
alcohol
is
high
but
its
well
hidden
in
this
smoothed
out
feeling
drink
than
improves
with
temperature
copper
in
color
mostly
clear
decadent
looking
with
a
tall
and
foamy
white
head
malt
first
and
hops
on
the
back
end
in
both
nose
and
taste
distinct
flavor
elements
include
an
herbal
complexion
culinary
herbs
maybe
bay
leaf
as
well
as
unlit
smokes
birch
syrup
and
tangerine
zest
its
dynamic
and
i
appreciate
the
interesting
hops
here
its
a
necessary
twist
in
a
style
of
beer
that
i
dont
think
gets
played
with
enough
it
comes
in
layers
and
is
far
more
complex
than
i
expected
it
to
ever
be
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
but
well
carbonated
frothy
in
feel
palate
coating
and
a
little
resinous
from
the
hops
finish
is
long
and
bitter
yet
clean
feeling
and
extremely
satisfying
overall
a
beautiful
american
take
on
the
english
classic
i
hope
this
one
sticks
around
o
think
of
an
extra
special
bitter
which
is
not
necessarily
bitter
but
balanced
and
then
make
it
a
double
imperialized
a
real
nice
drink
if
you
know
what
youre
getting
rich
and
relatively
dense
sticky
and
toffeesweet
with
dull
and
mild
resinous
bittering
strong
ale
but
not
necessarily
americanstyle
i
have
been
a
fan
of
evil
dead
for
a
while
now
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
murky
and
brackish
brown
topped
by
a
finger
of
glowing
khaki
foam
the
nose
comprises
wet
cardboard
and
buttery
toffee
backed
by
some
very
light
orange
peel
the
taste
holds
notes
of
dry
biscuit
orange
peel
light
earthy
greens
very
light
tobacco
and
a
general
sense
of
something
musty
hanging
around
malingering
in
pain
its
an
improvement
on
the
smell
but
that
aint
sayin
much
the
body
is
a
lightleaning
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
sortakinda
drying
finish
overall
this
stuff
just
seemed
messy
dirty
in
ways
it
shouldnt
definitely
not
a
fan
on
tap
at
left
hand
pours
a
mahogany
color
really
sweet
and
boozy
ick
some
hops
after
that
initial
impression
but
still
really
didnt
enjoy
this
overall
this
is
a
passable
beer
i
had
one
that
was
aged
4
years
and
it
really
turns
into
a
nice
malt
bomb
but
on
tap
it
is
somewhat
uninspiring
on
tap
at
kickbacks
in
jax
poured
into
a
small
snifter

beige

moderate
retention
atop
a
deep
mahogany
body

suddsy
and
oily

caramel
malts

brown

caramel
maybe
a
touch
of
nougat
fruitcake
taste
is
quite
sweet
no

noted
again
fruitcake
comes
to
mind
sweet
maltiness
pretty
unique
and
tasty
beer
very
easy
to
drink
pours
gold
with
a
nice
white
head
a
huge
malt
forward
aroma
offering
some
butterscotch
taffy
a
little
nutty
a
slight
infusion
of
some
fruit
and
a
little
hops
in
the
finish
flavor
is
defined
by
the
malt
offering
a
big
butterscotch
taffy
base
that
is
supported
by
some
nut
some
fruit
citric
in
nature
and
a
ever
so
slight
bitter
hoppy
finish
alcohol
is
disguised
quite
well
in
this
a
fuller
creamy
body
overall
i
generally
dont
enjoy
butterscotch
but
had
no
problems
with
this
one
here
this
was
definitely
one
of
the
better
nondark
beers
by
left
hand
would
gladly
drink
this
one
again
overall
fairly
nicely
hopped
brown
ale
it
starts
sweet
and
finishes
more
hoppy
but
does
so
with
a
nice
smooth
transition
overall
a
nice
one
off
beer
in
fact
not
very
esb
at
all
hides
the
abv
well
and
drinks
just
as
good
not
bad
for
a
one
time
thing

notes
poured
into
a
gulden
draak
tulip
pours
a
dark
orange
brown
with
a
small
rapidly
dissipating
head
light
piney
hops
aroma
mild
malt
and
dark
fruit
up
front
with
a
mild
spicy
malt
and
hop
finish
pleasant
but
not
all
that
interesting
a
satisfactory
one
time
ale
o
an
interesting
experiment
for
sure
a
double
esb
not
great
but
not
bad
either
this
poured
out
as
a
nice
brownish
color
the
head
was
a
light
tan
color
with
a
decent
retention
to
it
the
lacing
is
a
little
scattered
but
looks
ok
the
smell
of
the
beer
has
a
subtle
sweetness
to
it
there
are
aromas
of
toffee
and
sweet
malts
on
the
nose
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
also
quite
nice
some
boozy
characteristics
with
some
heavier
malt
flavors
and
a
nice
caramel
sweetness
the
mouthfeel
was
decent
overall
i
feel
this
beer
was
good
but
nothing
overly
spectacular
i
would
drink
it
again
for
sure
but
i
wouldnt
hunt
it
down
d
really
a
great
beer
could
drink
this
all
night
overall
a
nicely
balanced
and
slightly
warming
soft
creamy
sipper
very
well
done
a
slow
sipper
with
lots
of
complex
character
that
runs
deep
sawtooth
is
a
light
esb
so
i
really
was
expecting
something
similar
chainsaw
is
more
of
a
hybrid
between
a
belgian
dark
and
an
esb
with
extra
alcohol
kicked
in
if
there
was
oak
and
vanilla
in
this
it
would
be
a
clone
of
odells
woodcut
no
3
and
i
mean
that
in
the
nicest
way
o
i
like
it
but
not
sure
if
id
make
another
special
trip
for
a
bottle
i
sit
here
and
wonder
if
heat
may
have
played
a
small
role
in
the
overall
quality
of
this
bottle
the
place
i
bought
it
from
was
running
no
ac
on
a
90
degree
day
and
its
been
hot
all
week
medium
to
thick
in
the
mouthfeel
but
still
smooth
nearly
no
notice
of
the
alcohol
very
well
done
d
very
drinkable
well
balanced
and
complex
flavors
and
fairly
strong
very
smooth
for
a
relatively
high
abv
9
the
fruity
flavors
really
blend
nicely
with
the
rest
of
the
beer
a
heavy
body
smooth
and
thick
a
good
mix
of
dark
fruit
flavors
from
the
malt
and
earthy
herbal
hops
the
hops
definitely
dominate
but
this
big
beer
still
has
plenty
of
malty
flavors
the
finish
is
a
little
sweet
and
this
pours
murky
brown
and
has
nice
fluffy
offwhite
head
the
smell
is
malty
and
sweet
with
some
citrus
the
flavor
has
a
unique
dark
raison
flavor
but
unlike
other
beers
similar
to
this
one
it
isnt
dominated
by
an
overly
sweet
syrupy
aftertaste
there
is
a
nice
bitter
balance
that
keeps
you
coming
back
for
another
drink
i
will
say
this
is
one
of
the
more
complex
and
mysterious
tasting
beers
that
i
have
had
there
is
a
spicy
brown
sugar
taste
that
is
interesting
i
cannot
get
over
the
drinkability
i
really
thought
that
this
9
abv
would
overtake
this
beer
instead
it
is
a
well
balanced
bitter
beer
that
is
a
welcome
change
from
the
usual
overly
hoppy
and
sweet
beers
that
i
tend
to
choose
d
surprisingly
drinkable
for
being
big
and
complex
pours
a
murky
orange
lots
of
head
off
the
pour
pretty
despite
the
murkiness
malt
on
the
nose
nothing
else
really
huge
malt
profile
lots
and
lots
of
malt
on
the
tongue
toasts
in
the
background
tons
of
caramel
and
very
sweet
hardly
and
esb
which
apparently
its
a
double
esb
thick
and
almost
creamy
on
the
tongue
very
drinkable
clearly
a
tribute
to
cellaring
very
nice
when
it
mellows
out
not
a
bad
beer
this
way
but
let
this
one
get
close
to
room
temps
and
sip
it
more
like
a
brandy
despite
some
mild
gripes
this
is
pretty
drinkable
for
a
ninepercenter
there
are
enough
flavors
to
take
hold
of
and
that
long
bitter
finish
is
good
i
guess
its
another
goodbutnotgreat
left
hand
beer
for
me
drinkability
i
liked
it
so
much
on
tap
at
the
catskellar
thanks
adam
that
i
had
to
grab
a
bomber
its
better
on
cask
more
flavor
development
and
softer
hop
profile
but
this
ones
decent
as
well
pours
a
dark
amber
withs
light
brownish
hue
a
bit
cloudy
and
tightly
bubbled
white
head
that
dissipates
to
a
thin
rim
layer
nose
is
lighter
than
i
anticipated
with
some
toffee
standing
out
on
the
palate
that
toffee
is
there
again
overall
rather
sweet
with
some
overripe
fruit
on
the
hoppy
side
to
round
it
out
somewhat
a
bit
of
alcohol
warmth
on
the
finish
and
back
of
the
palate
the
sweetness
helps
to
make
it
more
drinkable
while
cold
but
as
it
warms
it
becomes
more
of
a
sipper
drinkability
probably
the
scariest
part
of
this
beer
is
how
drinkable
it
is
the
alcohol
burn
is
not
enough
to
stop
you
from
drinking
it
the
flavor
and
overall
experience
makes
this
beer
an
all
night
affair
im
almost
done
with
64
oz
growler
and
wish
i
had
another
i
could
see
this
as
a
house
beer
but
luckily
have
some
common
sense
definitely
an
occasional
treat
wish
i
could
brew
this
d
pretty
easy
to
drink
despite
a
bit
of
alcohol
burn
definitely
got
easier
to
drink
as
it
warmed
up
i
didnt
know
what
to
expect
from
this
one
but
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
how
different
it
tasted
ill
have
this
again
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
brownishamber
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
alcohol
candisugar
and
brown
sugar
the
beer
smells
fairly
boozy
the
flavor
is
brown
sugar
caramel
and
toffee
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
d
drinkable
as
hell
for
the
content
of
alcohol
and
a
excellent
beer
for
a
strong
ale
d
a
pretty
big
drink
with
big
intentions
a
bomber
should
sit
well
here
drinkability
solid
big
esb
nice
and
hoppy
not
typical
of
the
brewery
drinkability
sadly
the
stinging
bitterness
and
the
hot
glaring
alcohol
even
in
a
seemingly
sensible
ten
ounce
size
was
a
bit
much
for
me
anybody
want
to
split
this
with
me
having
said
that
its
still
decent
albeit
coarse
for
the
abv
its
very
drinkable
it
has
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
very
dark
head
flavor
is
malty
with
a
good
amount
of
hops
very
easy
to
drink
and
i
look
forward
to
my
next
one
the
bottle
art
isnt
all
that
appealing
but
that
isnt
what
we
buy
the
beer
for
i
suppose
the
brew
itself
pours
a
beautiful
copper
color
with
a
strong
head
that
lasts
a
good
while
without
clinging
to
the
glass
the
smell
is
quite
loud
the
kind
that
leaves
you
wondering
what
lies
beneath
the
bubbles
sure
enough
it
is
a
very
tasty
beer
a
strong
entry
from
left
hand
there
is
a
nice
lingering
hops
the
beer
is
quite
heavy
and
that
would
be
the
main
knock
certainly
however
a
good
choice
overall
d
good
hop
character
a
bit
resiny
in
the
mouth
and
on
the
tongue
disguides
the
abv
very
well
nice
brew
bold
and
fairly
balanced
d
i
liked
it
the
price
wasnt
bad
you
get
a
nice
bang
for
your
buck
would
definately
have
again
bottle
opened
with
a
nice
pop
poured
with
a
decent
tan
foamy
frothy
thick
head
color
is
a
cloudy
medium
to
dark
amber
nose
is
malt
caramel
fresh
cut
grass
hops
flavor
is
like
aroma
but
much
more
intense
plus
at
first
there
was
a
metallic
tinge
and
then
its
just
a
big
barley
wine
body
is
what
id
expect
full
and
it
has
great
carbonation
for
this
style
finish
is
like
a
good
barley
wine
huge
and
bittersweet
actually
reminds
me
of
several
homebrewed
barley
wines
d
pretty
good
overall
i
dont
love
it
but
am
glad
ive
tried
it
satisfies
the
craving
for
a
big
strong
ale
thats
got
depth
and
strong
on
hops
without
being
too
much
of
either
alcohol
is
a
little
strong
but
not
out
of
whack
actually
adding
a
lot
of
spicy
character
to
the
beer
d
wow
this
brew
packs
a
punch
but
if
one
paces
himself
he
could
sip
on
all
night
this
beer
really
scratched
an
itch
for
me
i
was
a
little
tired
of
american
strong
ales
being
either
overly
hoppy
overly
sweet
or
overly
boozy
absolutely
great
balance
this
really
does
feel
like
a
bigger
brother
of
the
light
delicious
sawtooth
ale
pretty
affordable
too
i
am
definitely
picking
up
another
bottle
soon
great
strong
ale
for
the
miserable
florida
summer
drinks
fairly
easy
for
the
style
abv
the
first
time
i
had
this
it
seemed
like
a
rough
around
the
edges
dipa
this
is
better
one
of
the
better
offerings
from
left
hand
that
skews
hoppy
imo
this
beer
is
a
double
ipa
but
it
has
an
aggressive
sweet
tone
plastic
phenol
strong
alcohol
character
that
hurt
the
drinkability
in
the
end
still
a
pretty
good
beer
just
wondering
how
good
it
could
get
db
price
is
ok
it
is
very
nice
to
get
a
beer
with
such
a
crazy
peach
aroma
and
taste
i
did
not
expect
it
in
the
least
a
very
unique
beer
that
one
would
want
to
show
to
their
friends
and
possible
new
beer
enthusiast
prospects
it
is
drinkable
the
peach
holds
its
ground
and
no
offflavors
exist
what
a
crazy
beer
truly
unique
and
delicious
offering
from
left
hand
i
love
it
thanks
to
softball
john
for
the
tip
go
lab
rats
much
better
than
sawtooth
esb
the
single
version
flavorful
but
not
overwhelming
and
wellbalanced
not
just
that
but
damned
near
sessionable
despite
the
abv
and
i
could
drink
it
any
time
of
year
no
hint
of
being
a
high
alcohol
double
very
drinkable
nothing
earth
shattering
but
still
tasty
stuff
ill
happily
order
this
again
d
a
bit
sweet
but
hoppy
enough
that
it
would
go
with
a
fish
or
poultry
dinner
tastes
sweet
up
front
like
buttertoffee
and
fuggles
this
moves
into
a
slightly
earthy
middle
and
a
finish
of
west
coast
american
hops
that
are
citrusy
and
bitter
nicely
complicated
and
an
absolute
lack
of
alcoholic
nodes
belies
its
high
abv
overall
id
been
wanting
to
try
this
beer
for
quite
a
while
as
i
was
a
big
fan
of
the
sawtooth
but
it
just
didnt
do
it
for
me
the
flavors
are
too
strong
for
what
worked
well
in
a
subtler
beer
worth
trying
but
not
worth
seeking
out
d
definitely
was
disappointed
with
this
one
not
at
all
what
i
was
expecting
the
13
price
tag
made
it
even
more
disappointing
has
a
fruit
profile
but
is
still
lower
on
the
hop
strength
profile
not
to
mention
the
almost
nonexistent
malt
profile
i
would
expect
this
type
of
character
from
a
pale
ale
or
an
esb
but
not
at
all
from
an
american
strong
ale
d
sawtooth
on
steroids
pretty
much
sums
this
one
up
its
a
very
nicely
done
beer
overall
flavors
are
similarly
overripe
with
a
sweet
and
somewhat
miraculous
undertone
of
berries
caramel
sweetness
is
deeper
than
in
the
nose
with
hops
jumping
forward
edible
flowers
green
herbs
and
grapefruit
zest
lead
the
way
medium
body
maybe
a
little
full
due
to
the
low
carbonation
finishes
hoppy
and
allows
the
almost
syrupy
berry
component
to
take
over
booze
is
wellhidden
and
overall
its
a
solid
package
on
a
side
note
the
new
bottle
design
is
awesome
left
hand
needs
to
redesign
everything
else
they
have
while
they
are
at
it
d
man
this
beer
did
next
to
nothing
for
me
the
beer
guy
at
my
local
bottle
shop
recommended
this
i
guess
i
should
have
ignored
him
and
grabbed
the
founders
porter
is
was
eyeing
up
one
of
these
is
more
than
enough
for
me
pours
a
slightly
hazy
red
with
amber
edges
fast
fading
thin
white
head
couple
of
dots
of
lace
smell
an
astringent
lemon
we
need
more
lemon
pledge
leafy
toffee
cherry
cough
syrup
taste
caramel
citrus
peel
capri
sun
cherry
mouthfeel
medium
bodied
nothing
special
cherry
cough
syrup
finish
this
is
really
horrific
it
tastes
like
a
cherry
capri
sun
with
a
big
medicinal
finish
up
until
this
i
was
on
the
fence
with
left
hand
hadnt
been
impressed
but
nothing
was
bad
this
is
just
bad
youre
off
my
christmas
card
list
left
hand
23rds
of
bomber
down
the
drain
i
really
like
sawtooth
and
a
number
of
other
left
hand
beers
for
that
matter
but
this
is
no
double
sawtooth
ive
enjoyed
few
beers
less
good
drinking
for
a
strong
ale
neither
bitter
nor
sweet
and
with
a
clean
finish
drinkability
is
okay
while
the
alcohol
is
wellconcealed
this
one
is
a
bit
messy
and
offbalanced
got
this
for
4
and
at
that
price
i
would
definitely
consume
this
bad
boy
again
and
again
it
was
slightly
silky
feeling
on
the
tongue
smooth
and
a
bit
syrupy
lots
of
hop
pine
bite
at
the
end
a
750ml
corked
bottle
poured
into
my
nonic
pint
glass
appears
a
clear
crimson
amber
with
about
an
inch
of
light
ecru
foam
nose
and
flavors
consist
of
caramel
malt
brown
sugar
biscuits
floral
hops
apples
approaching
full
bodied
but
not
quite
there
and
amply
carbonated
worth
trying
if
you
like
the
style
without
a
doubt
this
beer
will
not
satisfy
hopheads
but
it
is
an
excellent
choice
for
anyone
that
loves
malt
not
as
fruity
as
an
english
barleywine
but
every
bit
as
complex
and
enjoyable
maybe
even
more
this
is
my
first
taste
of
left
hands
beer
and
i
look
forward
to
trying
more
drinkability
is
solid
for
such
a
high
abv
smooth
and
balanced
with
some
great
flavors
that
make
an
interesting
brew
it
has
some
english
barleywine
notes
that
give
it
a
bit
more
character
and
depth
than
the
usual
strong
ale
one
id
definitely
seek
out
again
d
enjoyable
in
many
ways
drink
it
with
or
without
food
i
forgot
to
mention
alcohol
characteristics
because
they
werent
noticeable
drinkability
maybe
this
one
has
been
cellared
too
long
and
the
age
has
taken
its
toll
this
one
seems
more
of
a
barleywine
to
me
but
its
definitely
an
enjoyable
drink
color
is
a
deep
cloudy
mahogony
color
with
white
wisps
of
head
on
the
top
leaves
nice
alcoholic
lacing
around
the
edges
smell
is
deep
caramel
malts
and
some
rich
toffee
and
slight
citrus
hops
taste
is
pretty
much
like
the
nose
caramel
malt
is
right
there
with
sweetness
and
slight
citrus
hops
carry
it
a
little
farther
a
slight
alcohol
taste
at
the
end
this
is
pretty
low
carbonation
but
its
rather
thick
and
chewy
it
has
some
high
viscosity
to
it
as
well
overall
its
a
pretty
decent
brew
worth
a
shot
the
taste
leans
towards
the
malty
end
of
the
spectrum
but
there
is
a
firm
piney
and
floral
hop
flavor
that
is
very
nice
caramel
buttermilk
biscuit
flavor
is
unique
hides
the
abv
well
its
a
good
easy
drinking
big
beer
but
not
sure
it
is
quite
worth
the
high
price
tag
11
for
750ml
a
american
strong
ale
with
more
bitter
flavours
and
alcohol
than
i
had
expected
still
a
fine
beer
with
that
special
left
hand
hop
profile
mouthfeel
is
great
nicely
carbonated
and
textured
i
almost
want
to
chew
it
nicely
syrupy
without
being
too
thick
like
i
said
on
the
abv
its
hard
to
find
that
being
said
i
could
sit
and
drink
a
full
750ml
of
this
without
an
issue
which
i
am
going
to
finish
doing
now
that
i
am
finished
with
this
review
fairly
drinkable
but
not
really
my
thing
i
would
recommend
it
for
those
who
are
into
the
malts
d
this
certainly
isnt
a
terrible
beer
but
when
comparing
to
the
original
sawtooth
there
is
no
comparison
sawtooth
is
a
wonderful
beer
making
a
higher
abv
version
doesnt
go
so
well
im
glad
i
tried
it
but
it
certainly
wont
be
a
regular
in
the
rotation
i
probably
wont
drink
this
beer
in
the
future
a
decent
brew
seems
it
was
last
brewed
in
early
2008
i
probably
would
have
enjoyed
this
more
if
it
were
fresher
chainsaw
ale
doesnt
exactly
carve
a
wide
swath
through
the
american
strong
ale
style
but
it
does
carve
out
its
own
little
niche
even
at
the
slightly
high
price
of
12
99
id
be
happy
to
fire
this
baby
up
again
but
first
i
need
to
ease
my
way
into
the
evening
with
the
final
half
of
this
one
has
a
medium
body
and
a
prominent
alcohol
heat
that
lasts
throughout
the
session
d
not
bad
at
all
im
really
enjoying
this
one
overall
this
is
one
of
the
better
offerings
ive
had
from
left
hand
highly
recommended
not
trying
to
be
a
style
cop
but
id
definately
call
this
one
a
barleywine
pours
anice
amber
with
a
tan
head
the
nose
has
sweet
sugary
malts
and
subtle
citrus
hops
the
taste
is
not
too
complex
candy
malts
balanced
by
bitter
hops
medium
to
full
body
is
well
carbonated
overall
a
bit
light
but
still
quite
good
pours
a
cloudy
lightish
brownred
colored
body
with
a
slightly
offwhite
head
has
a
very
nutty
aroma
and
maltiness
a
very
malty
taste
somewhat
acidic
also
has
a
corn
syrup
sweetlike
taste
not
too
bad
for
a
malty
beer
d
damn
drinkable
left
hand
does
in
fact
make
some
real
nice
brews
hopefully
more
and
more
will
find
their
way
into
florida
has
a
strong
malty
aroma
with
a
fruity
overtone
mainly
apple
so
it
smells
more
like
fruit
juice
than
beer
pours
a
very
appetizing
translucent
cola
brown
with
a
very
thick
fluffy
light
tan
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
bit
flavor
is
malty
with
a
rather
strong
alcohol
bite
and
a
firm
undertone
of
hops
along
with
hints
of
caramel
and
cinnamon
texture
is
very
smooth
and
just
a
little
bit
syrupy
leaving
a
tingly
finish
that
is
edgy
and
hopbitter
but
just
a
tad
sweet
d
the
25oz
bomber
is
plenty
good
dessert
brew
or
meal
replacement
if
i
were
to
follow
this
up
with
a
second
beer
that
beer
would
be
somthing
light
bodied
an
excellent
american
strong
right
up
there
with
arrogant
bastard
hazy
copper
pour
with
a
medium
offwhite
head
rich
aroma
of
caramel
malt
piney
hops
and
yeast
nice
bittersweet
taste
of
leather
wood
caramel
resiny
hops
and
a
touch
of
smoke
an
allaround
excellent
beer
d
i
may
need
to
try
this
again
i
can
see
this
as
a
dessert
and
cigars
kind
of
ale
a
big
malty
beer
for
the
winter
season
definitely
not
a
sessionable
beer
try
it
when
you
can
very
drinkable
its
delicious
and
not
too
heavy
like
a
stout
or
something
as
it
warms
there
is
an
unfortunate
scented
candle
flavor
from
the
vanilla
but
otherwise
its
a
good
strong
ale
its
rich
full
and
complex
how
can
you
go
wrong
certainly
worth
seeking
out
an
interesting
beer
but
nothing
too
special
it
isnt
the
hoppiest
beer
either
just
a
strong
ale
drinkability
i
may
have
to
hunt
down
a
fresh
bottle
after
sampling
this
one
this
is
one
fine
beer
from
left
hand
pretty
good
a
dark
malty
sweet
brew
d
this
was
pretty
good
but
ive
had
better
in
this
style
and
at
a
lower
price
tag
i
love
left
hand
especially
thier
milk
stout
this
offering
for
the
high
price
will
only
be
bought
this
time
taste
is
thick
and
chewy
woody
dark
fruit
caramel
malt
hops
in
the
back
finish
is
dry
and
nicely
bitter
dability
fairly
high
for
a
strong
ale
if
price
were
no
object
but
at
12
99
for
a
750
ml
bottle
this
one
will
have
to
be
a
rare
treat
poured
this
into
my
boulevard
smokestack
goblet
pours
a
deep
amber
brown
not
much
of
a
head
with
a
little
bit
of
lacing
along
the
side
smell
is
very
sweet
malty
with
brown
sugar
and
caramel
undertones
taste
is
much
sweeter
and
maltier
than
i
was
anticipating
hops
are
present
but
not
pronounced
mouthfeel
is
little
thinner
than
i
was
hoping
for
but
it
doesnt
adversely
affect
the
beer
a
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
make
this
beer
truly
outstanding
one
of
left
hands
best
pretty
damn
rustic
very
smooth
and
alcohol
is
pretty
well
hidden
im
caca
for
coocoo
puffs
lacing
is
premium
stuff
caramel
molasses
some
dust
a
good
brew
but
a
stretch
at
11
nothing
spectacular
just
the
same
old
left
hand
bullshit
d
this
is
a
beer
that
is
easy
to
drink
and
creeps
up
on
you
it
reminds
me
of
stones
arrogant
bastard
yet
a
little
more
subtle
a
very
tasty
brew
from
left
hand
that
ill
be
coming
back
to
for
sure
one
of
the
best
beers
from
this
brewery
and
hence
is
recommended
had
this
on
tap
at
the
5th
earl
market
in
decatur
georgia
pours
a
very
dark
amber
with
some
orange
highlights
almost
brown
good
clarity
and
a
very
finely
beaded
light
beige
head
the
smell
is
very
light
with
some
maple
malt
and
a
trace
of
piney
hops
the
taste
is
highly
unusual
but
i
like
it
quite
sweet
and
with
flavors
of
maple
cured
bacon
in
a
glass
with
some
piney
hops
at
the
end
meaty
with
maple
and
brown
sugar
and
some
salt
a
trifle
too
sweet
but
the
hops
help
begin
to
balance
it
i
definitely
could
only
drink
one
of
these
no
matter
how
intriguing
had
this
one
on
tap
at
stud
and
herbs
in
minneapolis
poured
a
dark
amberorange
color
with
hints
of
brown
on
the
edges
nice
amount
of
foam
but
left
little
sparse
chunks
of
lacing
on
the
glass
smell
was
incredibly
malty
delicately
sweet
with
hints
of
burnt
sugar
and
tons
of
caramel
taste
was
overthetop
malty
i
loved
it
brown
sugar
burnt
caramel
slight
fruity
accents
in
the
background
some
hints
of
lemonlime
and
a
good
dosage
of
hops
that
are
present
but
in
no
way
can
keep
up
with
the
malts
this
was
one
bad
boy
indeed
very
thick
and
full
bodied
with
a
nice
amount
of
carbonation
the
high
abv
was
felt
even
while
consuming
a
huge
plate
of
chili
cheese
fries
which
keeps
the
drinkability
low
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
one
and
it
was
a
nice
find
and
the
only
place
visited
that
night
with
it
on
tap
excellent
another
great
brew
from
left
hand
great
balance
between
malt
and
hops
terrific
effort
from
left
hand
one
more
bottle
left
and
i
cant
wait
for
it
this
is
a
great
brew
i
love
the
sawtooth
and
this
is
a
very
apparent
double
esb
cheers
not
retired
as
there
is
a
2008
version
now
out
i
had
last
years
not
too
hoppy
but
significant
not
too
malty
but
significant
an
easy
drinking
dangerously
hidden
alcohol
good
head
initially
nothing
outstanding
but
it
was
enjoable
and
satisfying
a
sipper
to
be
sure
at
9
abv
though
it
was
meant
to
be
interesting
tasty
but
i
dont
know
that
it
really
held
my
interest
could
be
the
harshnessastringency
throughout
something
about
it
i
suppose
this
is
an
american
strong
ale
with
some
american
barleywine
characteristics
certainly
worth
having
if
you
want
a
bigger
sawtooth
ale
drink
hell
yeah
go
for
it
this
is
a
wonderful
brew
enjoy
the
rich
smoothness
out
of
the
2008
bottle
conditioned
750ml
corked
and
caged
bottle
pours
a
pretty
chestnut
brown
color
with
an
excellent
dense
tan
colored
head
that
left
a
wall
of
lacing
and
a
fluffy
cap
the
smell
is
very
malty
a
nice
roasted
presence
with
a
slight
pineapple
hop
aroma
the
taste
is
a
nice
mellow
toastedroasted
malt
caramel
spice
and
a
very
light
hint
of
port
the
feel
is
moderate
to
full
the
carbonation
is
on
the
soft
side
and
the
finish
is
excellent
well
balanced
alcohol
is
well
hidden
this
is
a
very
fine
american
ale
well
constructed
i
need
to
pick
me
up
an
extra
bottle
or
so
to
age
looking
forward
to
trying
their
other
750ml
offerings
cheers
beertracker
d
a
most
enjoyable
brew
recommended
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
oily
smooth
wish
it
had
a
bit
more
carbonation
not
as
drinkable
as
i
would
have
liked
i
still
dont
know
whether
i
like
this
beer
or
not
d
an
incredibly
drinkable
beer
its
a
shame
this
was
only
a
oneoff
as
it
has
an
assertive
hop
and
malt
presence
but
is
still
balanced
at
the
same
time
mouthfeel
is
superb
and
it
makes
for
a
quaffable
delight
that
id
love
to
have
more
of
excellent
in
autumn
as
the
weather
has
gotten
colder
md
decent
carbonation
but
not
too
much
good
creamy
mouthfeel
unfortunately
not
very
high
drinkability
due
to
both
alcohol
content
and
alcohol
character
d
as
far
as
strong
ales
go
this
goes
down
like
water
the
taste
is
not
at
all
imposing
i
expect
more
flavor
from
a
strong
ale
but
this
would
be
a
good
way
to
ease
someone
into
the
style
recommended
overall
this
was
a
decent
strong
ale
not
my
favorite
in
the
world
but
i
would
definatly
recommend
giving
it
a
try
the
bottle
fermentation
leaves
alot
of
yeast
in
the
glass
towards
the
end
and
you
really
gotta
love
beers
that
are
still
alive
a
good
call
and
a
nice
one
off
selection
overall
a
decent
brew
interesting
but
nothing
that
really
sets
it
above
others
might
be
better
during
the
winter
as
heavy
as
this
one
is
the
beer
poured
a
crisp
amber
with
a
decent
head
that
diminished
to
a
ring
the
aroma
was
strong
on
caramel
malts
with
some
earthy
pine
hops
the
taste
was
dominated
by
both
pine
hops
and
syrupy
malts
the
beer
was
a
little
to
syrupy
in
the
mouth
for
me
even
for
a
9
beer
a
lot
of
alcohol
was
present
this
one
was
somewhat
of
a
disappointment
compared
to
my
expectations
poured
from
a
750
mi
bottle
a
cloudy
tea
color
with
a
tan
three
finger
head
that
held
very
well
to
the
finish
and
lots
of
lace
aromas
of
caramel
and
chocolate
and
brown
sugar
all
come
through
all
the
same
sweet
flavors
come
to
your
taste
buds
and
then
the
alcohol
warms
the
finish
light
mouthfeel
and
light
carbonation
fits
this
beer
well
really
enjoyed
this
beer
overall
chainsaw
is
competently
done
but
forgettable
strong
ale
it
made
for
a
nice
cooking
beer
when
i
used
in
in
a
beef
dish
and
id
like
to
try
it
on
tap
someday
to
see
how
it
compares
when
fresh
poured
from
a
750
ml
corked
and
caged
bottle
with
a
painted
label
thats
pretty
cool
it
poured
a
dark
rich
amber
it
had
a
massive
3
finger
head
that
slowly
settled
into
a
14
foam
with
good
lacing
the
smell
was
hard
to
pin
down
but
i
didnt
like
it
not
sure
how
to
describe
it
but
some
have
called
it
earthy
or
woody
i
can
see
that
but
probably
more
in
the
earthy
vein
damp
mud
with
rotting
vegetation
maybe
i
thought
it
would
detract
from
the
flavor
but
it
didnt
once
you
get
the
glass
away
from
your
nose
but
thats
half
the
drink
as
it
warmed
the
alcohol
became
more
pronounced
in
the
aroma
and
taste
the
mouthfeel
was
really
good
overall
i
liked
sawtooth
and
most
left
hand
beers
but
this
one
missed
the
mark
for
me
first
ive
had
of
the
style
so
it
may
be
the
style
3
na
n
n

rusty

color
with
a
foamy
lighttan
head
that
leaves
sheets
of
sticky
lace
on
the
walls
of
the
glass
as
you
drink
the
aroma
seems
to
be
dominated
by
a
woodiness
but
there
are
additional
notes
of
brown
sugar
a
light
fruitiness
and
even
some
cookie
dough
taste
begins
with
sweet
malt
and
a
bit
of
fruity
nectarine
that
is
quickly
overpowered
by
bitter
citrusy
hop
resins
the
alcohol
becomes
more
pronounced
towards
the
end
overall
a
fairly
nice
beer
but
a
horrible
value
at

for
a
750ml
this
came
in
a
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
standard

it
poured

cloudy
bronze
color
with
a
slightly
off
white
head
smells
of
sweet
sweet
malts
sugar
caramel
with
citrus
and
some
hoppy
notes
as
well
it
tastes
of
caramel
and
sweet
malts
but
even
some
slight
toasted
malts
are
noticable
other
flavors
that
are
apparent
are
some
sligth
fuity
flavors
with
oily
slick
hops
slight
alcohol
taste
is
present
in
the
finish
but
not
to
bad
d
nice
big
strong
flavors
very
nice
beer
would
buy
more
if
i
could
pours
a
cloudy
burnt
orange
with
a
giant
tan
foamy

very
nice

you
can
make

aroma
the
taste

maltbitter
hops
and
a
creamy

not
badbut
the
alcohol
is
a

the
mf
is

with
the
flavors

only
ok
a
decent
beer
that
could
use
some
cellaring
mouthfeel
is
medium

hot
at

mildly
grainy
poured

strong
aroma
of
nutty
bread

and
woody
hops
good
malt
up
front
but
quickly
overwhelmed
by
an
allencompassing
pungent
bitterness
tasty
but
perhaps
overdone
taste
becomes
more
fruity
at
the
end
but
mostly
whats
left
is
a
very
long
lingering
dryness
rich
creamy
mouthfeel
rounds
it
nicely
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thinner
than
i
would
have
liked
and
the
carbonation
is
a
touch
low
drinkability
is
still
good
though
easy
to
put
down
for
a
9
brew
it
has
an
interesting
flavor
that
seems
to
be
a
kicked
up
sawtooth
which
is
how
it
is
labeled
not
the
typical
strong
ale
as
this
one
is
classified
and
not
the
typical
dipa
either
but
not
quite
barleywine
ill
go
with
double
esb
opinion
this
beer
is
pretty
interesting
and
good
in
its
own
way
i
am
not
too
big
on
trying
to
pigeonhole
a
beer
but
this
one
would
be
hard
to
classify
it
has
too
dominant
of
a
malt
profile
to
be
a
iipa
i
would
say
that
it
is
closer
to
an
american
barley
wine
as
anything
else
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
i
dont
know
if
the
price
would
let
me
partake
in
this
one
very
often
i
am
glad
i
tried
it
but
i
doubt
i
will
be
stockpiling
this
one
before
it
goes
away
d
not
great
but
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
are
so
good
it
gets
more
points
still
im
happily
sucking
this
baby
down
not
much
carbonation
in
this
beer
after
a
vigorous
pour
i
still
only
get
big
fat
bubbles
that
pop
away
and
give
way
to
a
slight
foamy
head
that
is
just
a
skim
on
the
top
body
is
a
murkey
reddish
brown
nose
has
defanent
hints
of
chocolate
notes
with
a
malty
feel
and
a
hint
of
anise
a
very
flat
tongue
coating
feel
it
is
dark
and
rich
and
has
a
bit
of
roasted
malt
overall
it
is
a
solid
drinkable
beer
but
not
anything
special
leaves
a
medium
thickness
on
the
mouth
ok
brew
p
s
scrolling
through

i

blitheringidiot
i
only
paid
11
29
before
tax
medium
bodied
with
a
dry
finish
even
more
floaters
on
the
second
pour
makes
it
a
bit
harder
to
get
through
the
glass
im
not
a
fan
of
the
chunks
and
this
has
a
lot
of
them
flavor
is
a
bit
over
the
top
with
quick
and
sudden
hop
bite
that
dies
but
then
is
followed
with
some
heat
from
the
alcohol
the
malts
give
this
a
very
sweet
malty
base
some
pepper
and
spice
too
very
light
body
that
kind
of
evaporates
off
the
tongue
rather
a
dissappointment
honestly

beer
to
try
but
worth
the
price
overall
its
decent
its
a
little
sweet
and
melony
it
does
have
a
bitter
finish
but
the
flavors
arent
well
blended
d
this
beer
has
nice
complexity
and
some
good
balance
with
the
alcohol
hidden
in
the
background
the
hops
really
add
nice
balance
to
the
malts
mouthfeel
pretty
earthy
berry
overall
with
some
lambic
like
tartness
but
not
bad
the
taste
is
quite
sweet
up
front
but
slowly
moves
to
ample
malt
character
that
is
not
all
that
sweet
in
the
finish
a
dry
toasted
malt
note
evocative
of
biscuits
dominates
the
finish
and
leaves
an
almost
salty
rich
malty
note
that
lingers
on
in
the
finish
a
solid
herbal
character
is
also
here
there
is
a
bit
of
an
astringent
side
to
the
hop
character
the
hops
though
are
fairly
muted
like
a
lightly
hopped
supped
up
amber
ale
in
the
end
this
beer
is
just
not
that
well
integrated
it
is
rich
and
malty
but
needs
some
ample
hop
character
to
help
balance
things
out
the
finish
has
a
touch
too
much
hot
alcohol
which
tends
to
unbalance
things
a
bit
more
still
drinkable
and
even
a
bit
enjoyable

above
the

murky
reddish

of

the

pretty
quick
down

largely
boring
taste
is
moderately
bitter
upfront
with
ample

kicking

quickly
to

doesnt
quite
make
it
and
the

lingers
into

smooth

kind
of
flat
and
drinkability
is
reasonable
alcohol
is
not
very
apparent
in
this
brew
which
could
be
dangerous
this
brew
seems
to
have
so
much
potential
in
so
many
areas
i
ended
up
being
a
bit
harsh
but
thats
the
impression
i
was
left
with
for
better
or
worse
pours
a
cloudy
brown
color
with
a
tall
head
that
hangs
around
and
leaves
plenty
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
had
a
lot
of
caramel
character
with
some
fruits
along
for
the
ride
the
flavor
was
much
the
same
with
a
little
spice
and
alcohol
the
caramel
really
comes
through
in
this
one
very
enjoyable
the
mouthfeel
is
moderate

the
drinkability
is

brown
appearance

beefy
carbonation

they
play
well
overall
a
big
beer
and
quite
sweet
beer
deep
in
flavor
but
a
bit
unidimensional
and
featuring
nectarines
slight
mincemeat
and
candied
fruit
hops
lend
a
slatey
underlayer
to
the
finish
though
they
seem
to
show
up
mainly
as
bitter
flavoring
hops
without
much
impact
on
the
smell
alcoholic
senses
by
the
end
of
the
glass
nothing
seems
wrong
with
this
beer
but
it
doesnt
shine
with
outstanding
notable
characteristics
either
and
its
not
a
very
good
value
in
my
opinion
pours
a
solid
dark
brown
tea
color
with
copper
to
amber
highlites
and
2
fingers
of
offwhite
head
that
falls
to
a
full
coat
over
top
clarity
is
moderate
and
i
see
no
carbonation
bubbling
from
the
bottom
nose
is
rife
with
puffs
of
alcohol
and
deep
caramel
and
just
a
hint
of
dark
fruit
plus
an
undertone
of
graineyness
flavor
is
nice
very
solid
deep
caramel
and
lighter
fig
and
graineyness
a
nice
peppery
hop
hits
on
the
finish
playing
wilth
the
alcohol
that
comes
through
on
the
finish
the
alcohol
is
a
touch
spicey
not
hot
as
i
had
expected
it
to
be
feel
is
moderate
with
a
lack
of
carbonation
i
could
use
just
a
hint
of
bubbles
in
there
to
break
up
the
stillness
there
is
some
drying
on
the
side
of
my
tongue
on
the
finish
as
well
overall
this
one
is
pretty
nice
the
alcohol
is
a
little
strong
in
the
nose
but
otherwise
there
is
nothing
really
to
complain
about
tastes
good
nice
citrus
hop
start
turns
to
malt
sweet
with
a
flat
and
modest
hop
bitter
aftertaste
touch
of
pine
in
the
hops
which
i
dont
find
in
sawtooth
undertone
flavors
are
caramel
fruity
esters
melon
and
pear
with
a
zing
and
a
dab
of
molasses
pretty
underwhelming
taste
considering
how
simple
sawtooth
is
but
the
flavors
blend
so
well
i
was
hoping
for
much
more
here
mdthick
body
and
modest
carbonation
hmm
a
double
sawtooth
ale
i
liked
the
standard
so
i
went
for
the
stronger
version
poured
a
hazed
deep
amber
with
a
big
fluffy
slight
off
white
head
that
stuck
like
glue
to
the
glass
aromas
of
brown
sugar
and
fruity
malt
dominate
with
a
noticable
peppery
hop
noteit
takes
awhile
for
the
flavors
to
come
together
it
took
nearly
34
of
the
bottle
for
everything
to
come
together
but
once
they
did
it
made
for
quite
a
nice
beer
starts
out
on
the
sweeter
side
notes
of
brown
sugar
and
ripe
fruit
as
it
came
together
better
a
resiny
hop
presence
became
more
pronounced
with
light
alcohol
burn
in
the
finish
if
you
wait
on
this
beer
its
a
fine
ale
the
hops
provide
more
balance
than
character
but
they
do
show
up
on
the
palate
a
nice
beer
i
would
buy
again
i
think
after
much
twisting
tugging
pulling
and
prying
on
the
wire
basket
and
cork
the
bottle
emitted
a
nice
pop
just
the
sound
i
like
to
hear
after
a
long
hard
day
at
the
salt
mine
upon
the
pour
from
the
750ml
brown
bottle
the
color
a
bemused
brown
with
a
massive
semicreamy
light
tan
head
that
slowly
erodes
leaving
a
thick
and
sticky
sheet
of
lace
to
coat
the
glass
nose
has
a
nice
bit
of
hop
aroma
also
some
over
ripe
fruit
id
say
pineapple
all
back
by
a
bit
of
earthiness
start
is
moderately
sweet
the
grain
profile
delightful
and
the
top
moderate
in
feel
finish
is
light
to
medium
in
carbonation
the
hops
give
a
nice
spicy
kick
and
the
end
quite
dry
and
long
lasting
aftertaste
a
nice
drinking
beer
but
watch
the
9
percent
abv
taste
is
nice
and
malty
caramel
malt
a
grainlike
flavor
hops
play
a
supporting
role
adding
citrus
flavors
and
balancing
the
malt
mouthfeel
is
bordering
on
being
syrupy
but
that
is
somewhat
expected
with
the
abv
very
drinkable
i
dont
notice
the
alcohol
in
this
beer
anymore
than
i
notice
it
in
a
normal
esb
i
have
to
admit
to
being
disappointed
by
this
one
ive
had
it
twice
now
once
at
the
wildland
fire
benefit
at
the
pumphouse
and
tonight
at
the
brewery
on
boston
ave
its
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
but
its
just
not
that
interesting
both
times
ive
noticed
a
paucity
of
hops
both
in
the
nose
and
in
taste
there
is
a
whole
lot
of
malt
sweetness
and
a
pleasant
cereal
quality
balanced
with
an
adequate
level
of
bitterness
but
it
just
doesnt
have
that
much
going
for
it
ill
give
it
one
more
try
of
course
750
ml
corked
and
bailed
silk
screened
bottle
dark
copper
color
with
immense
froth
dull
underwhelming
aroma
which
is
malt
accented
but
a
bit
subtle
however
fairly
nice
flavor
balance
with
rich
malt
and
hop
flavors
abound
smooth
creamy
body
with
well
hidden
alcohol
impressive
mouthfeel
i
finally
got
to
taste
this
after
some
delay
this
is
there
bigger
and
deeper
version
of
sawtooth
ale
after
a
semi
aggressive
pour
it
produced
a
large
orange
head
the
body
had
a
full
dark
orange
tint
the
nose
was
good
with
wisps
of
toasted
malt
sort
of
a
caramel
sweetness
the
taste
had
a
fruit
forward
approach
mixed
with
a
kind
of
citrus
mouth
feel
for
being
9
it
went
down
smooth
not
over
powering
over
all
a
good
product
any
fan
of
there
regular
sawtooth
ale
would
like
this
and
still
not
be
chased
away
by
the
alcohol
content
starts
as
a
hairball
finishes
as
a
rodenbach
yummy
wish
i
would
have
bought
2
i
wasnt
feeling
the
carameltoffee
malt
and
for
certain
the
piney
hops
were
weak
at
best
and
only
noticeable
in
the
aftertaste
for
a
brief
moment
maybe
it
was
the
high
carbonation
that
did
this
beer
in
as
it
felt
like
a
soda
with
some
booze
and
yeast
thrown
in
for
good
measure
i
wouldnt
call
this
a
drain
pour
as
much
as
it
an
underwhelming
letdown
yes
american
strong
ales
can
vary
in
their
flavor
profile
and
strength
but
in
this
instance
i
felt
that
this
beer
was
categorized
incorrectly
fans
of
boulevard
should
still
give
this
a
go
because
its
a
fairly
solid
beer
from
top
to
bottom
where
it
falls
in
their
portfolio
is
the
bigger
question
pours
into
an
imperial
nonic
a
rich
deep
amber
with
a
frothy
off
white
head
atop
aromas
are
on
the
lighter
side
with
some
resinous
hops
and
caramel
malts
standing
out
mostseems
a
bit
restrained
the
flavors
are
held
back
a
little
it
seems
as
wellpine
resin
and
faint
citric
hops
to
go
along
with
some
caramel
and
brown
sugar
notesthe
body
is
particularly
thin
feeling
was
hoping
for
a
little
more
from
these
two
top
notch
brewersanother
ho
hum
collab
not
sure
exactly
what
they
were
going
for
here
flavor
profile
is
messy
o
not
great
but
good
like
other
reviews
not
as
good
as
expected
from
brewery
but
still
drinkable
c
a
lush
tan
froth
stands
steady
atop
this
reddishbrown
brew
smells
of
persimmon
black
grape
molasses
and
slight
vegetal
tannins
tastes
of
grain
wrapped
in
notes
of
grape
and
plum
grape
juice
and
a
pinch
of
nutmeg
easy
going
down
with
a
very
slight
alcohol
presence
but
still
quite
flavorful
while
it
doesnt
necessarily
explode
with
venerable
nuanceand
though
i
enjoyed
it
much
better
when
i
had
it
on
tap
in
minnesota
where
listed
as
brewed
at
odell
versus
out
of
a
bomber
bought
in
kansas
city
listed
as
brewed
at
boulevardits
by
no
means
a
weak
celebration
of
two
quartercenturies
of
brewing
pretty
forgettable
strong
ale
in
this
one
serving
type
bottle
it
pours
a
chill
hazed
amber
under
a
1
white
foam
cap
with
a
very
slight
amber
tint
the
nose
is
faint
with
a
light
wisp
of
grape
light
very
ripe
fruit
pine
and
light
sugars
you
first
notice
the
toffee
aromas
then
grape
to
chardonnay
followed
by
pine
a
thread
of
light
toffee
runs
all
the
way
through
the
palate
supported
by
light
fruit
with
some
piney
bitterness
on
the
finish
nicely
balanced
it
has
above
average
carbonation
and
medium
to
just
below
on
the
body
wow
a
very
bland
and
unexciting
offering
by
two
breweries
that
generally
offer
impressive
beers
i
dont
get
this
little
nose
or
aroma
and
the
flavor
is
just
a
tad
distinctive
with
a
mostly
weak
malt
body
and
an
overall
metallic
hop
bitterness
something
big
and
mysterious
is
missing
here
and
this
winds
up
being
a
near
total
dud
when
weighed
against
these
two
breweries
other
offerings
weak
and
sickly
in
the
grand
scheme
of
things

from
a
750

happy
twentyfifth
anniversary
boulevard
keep
up
the
great
work
sometimes
good
breweries
should
continue
to
do
their
own
good
things
and
not
collaborate
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
it
was
a
bit
lacking
in
body
but
the
taste
was
great
even
with
the
lack
of
body
the
fact
that
it
was
so
smooth
going
down
made
the
feel
outstanding

toffee
and

the
way
in
the
taste
profile
smells
like
a
marzen
taste
is
big
toasted
malt
light
chocolate
and
light
woodsy
hops
taste
is
like
a
mix
between
a
marzen
and
a
pale
ale
with
not
as
much
hops
as
i
usually
associate
with
a
pale
ale
not
a
bad
beer
but
when
i
heard
these
two
breweries
were
collaborating
i
was
expecting
much
more
a
pass
for
me
in
the
future
on
draft
this
was
way
hoppier
way
more
drinkable
two
great
brewers
youd
think
would
come
up
with
something
better
than
this

hops
and
a

overall
good
appearance
aroma
complexity
and
blend
but
the
body
is
underwhelming
this
was
excellent
when
two
of
my
favorite
breweries
got
together
to
make
a
beer
i
knew
i
wanted
to
try
it
and
i
finally
found
a
bottle
its
a
great
golden
ale
not
too
heavy
very
smooth
and
i
want
more
ive
heard
the
boulevard
version
is
the
one
in
bottles
and
is
a
little
maltier
as
compared
to
the
odell
version
that
is
on
tap
and
tends
to
run
a
little
hoppier
so
keep
that
in
mind
if
you
are
looking
around
they
may
be
slightly
different
depending
on
which
brewery
made
it
and
how
you
are
drinking
it
but
either
way
this
is
a
beer
well
worth
seeking
out
and
heres
hoping
for
a
50th
anniversary
collaboration
golden

notes
alcohol
well

super
smooth
overall
im
not
convinced
this
is
an
american
strong
ale
but
then
again
im
not
sure
how
to
classify
it
its
not
any
of
the
pale
ale
styles
not
enough
hops
of
course
not
a
porter
or
stout
so
i
guess
this
classification
works
the
history
and
story
behind
this
beer
and
the
breweries
who
collaborated
on
it
is
much
more
interesting
than
that
of
the
beer
itself
although
it
is
certainly
worth
a
try
a
bit
on
the
steep
price
side
i
had
hoped
for
a
much
more
adventurous
recipe
when
i
saw
these
guys
were
collaborating
a
strong
pale
to
ipa
on
the
hops
front
but
more
bitter
than
flavor
there
over
a
unique
and
robust
autumnal
grain
base
copper
and
wheaty
fuller
bodied
and
balanced
the
way
an
esb
might
be
nothing
new
in
terms
of
style
overall
though
i
really
thought
they
would
get
more
creative
to
mark
such
a
momentous
occasion
so
i
am
let
down
by
that
the
beer
though
as
unambitious
as
it
is
is
very
good
full
flush
warming
body
aggressive
bubbles
and
a
nice
tacky
oily
hop
character
in
the
finish
its
big
in
flavor
and
its
perfect
for
this
time
of
year
i
have
no
issue
with
the
beer
at
all
i
just
had
hoped
for
a
lot
more
with
these
two
giants
getting
together
maybe
next
time
tired
this
at
a
beer
school
event
in
kc
the
founders
of
boulevard
and
odells
where
there
talking
about
their
history
for
two
hours
i
dont
think
strong
ale
is
the
correct
style
more
of
a
esb
with
belgium
yeast
the
boulevard
beer
is
a
very
malty
compared
to
the
odell
style
only
on
draft
that
is
considerably
more
hoppy
i
was
a
little
disappointed
with
both
of
them
but
was
awesome
to
hear
their
passion
for
two
years
old
chicago
tap
drank
in
pewter
stein
like
a
light
ipa
not
as
hoppy
as
their
odells
regular
ipa
but
still
has
the
great
citrusy
notes
everything
ive
tried
from
boulevard
has
been
amazing
except
this
a
truly
mediocre
drink
from
an
otherwise
outstanding
company
a
earthydirt
like
aroma
followed
by
a
thin
ale
that
while
hiding
its
alcohol
well
doesnt
make
sense
with
the
lightly
noticeable
chocolate
notes
a
rare
miss
by
boulevard
in
their
smokestack
series
this
is
a
weird
beer
i
got
no
chocolate
at
all
i
really
didnt
like
it
much
at
all
glad
i
didnt
plunk
down
19
for
it
i
think
this
would
be
better
received
under
a
different
name
the
chocolate
is
subtle
and
fitting
of
the
artisanal
style
that
elbow
works
in
if
youre
coming
into
this
expecting
hersheystype
flavor
or
what
you
get
in
popular
chocolateflavored
stouts
youll
be
at
least
somewhat
disappointed
overall
i
truly
dislike
when
a
beer
is
billed
as
having
a
particular
adjunct
and
yet
nothing
of
that
adjunct
can
be
found
in
the
flavor
it
feels
like
false
advertising
even
if
said
adjunct
is
actually
in
the
beer
im
also
not
a
fan
of
expecting
something
sweet
and
getting
hit
in
the
tongue
with
a
clod
of
wet
woody
mud
not
a
repeater
not
a
fan
it
just
seems
like
the
are
trying
to
cover
a
poor
base
beer
with
some
chocolate
that
doesnt
really
present
itself
in
the
bottle
the
chocolate
is
more
present
on
tap
but
still
seems
to
miss
the
mark
for
me
great
beer
however
the
chocolate
is
not
there
or
to
subtle
for
me
i
enjoyed
it
but
not
sure
it
should
be
called
a
chocolate
ale
dont
judge
a
book
by
its
cover
cocoa
nose
dark
chocolate
palate
light
color
long
finish
medium
heavy
body
liked
this
beer
very
much
overallglad
i
tried
it
because
i
was
so
curious
but
i
really
dont
think
ill
be
buying
anymore
mf
overall
not
too
sweet
and
certainly
smooth
but
there
is
a
blast
on
chocolate
sweetness
in
the
middle
that
for
some
might
take
away
from
the
final
herbal
bitterness
in
the
finish
3
5
strongly
would
not
recommend
particularly
if
you
like
chocolate
or
stouts
in
general
already
you
taste
the
alcohol
more
this
year
vs
last
year
this
is
a
smooth
beer
presents
differently
than
a
traditional
chocolate
stout
i
am
drinking
this
on
tap
at
the
bryant
lake
bowl
it
pours
a
light
slightly
hazy
brownish
amber
with
a
thin
white
cap
that
leaves
whore
stocking
lace
the
nose
is
chocolate
over
light
grains
with
some
light
sugars
it
has
a
very
intensely
chocolate
palate
which
is
surprising
for
a
beer
this
light
colored
it
actually
starts
a
little
thin
and
grows
in
body
and
character
as
it
moves
over
the
tongue
and
finishes
with
lingering
chocolate
tastes
the
chocolate
is
semisweet
to
a
little
more
medium
body
and
medium
levels
of
fine
soft
carbonation
dark
golden
in
color
with
a
little
head
very
fruity
aroma
fruity
taste
with
a
little
sweetness
malty
flavor
an
ok
beer
o
really
interesting
a
well
executed
take
on
a
chocolate
flavored
beer
not
much
else
going
on
here
and
kind
of
a
one
trick
pony
again
nice
to
see
chocolate
used
in
a
different
context
but
i
didnt
find
the
beer
anything
too
special
definitely
one
to
split
unless
youre
really
into
chocolatecocoa
beers
without
a
heavy
malt
presence
chocolate
isnt
overwhelming
amazing
that
its
an
ale
with
the
chocolate
taste
that
it
has
phenomenal
beer
o
this
was
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
the
alcohol
was
more
prominent
than
i
like
and
the
chocolate
taste
was
kind
of
weak
i
guess
my
expectations
were
off
i
should
have
read
reviews
and
been
prepared
corked
caged
bottle
into
tulip
nice
amber

color
with
fluffy

fantastic

yeast
tobacco
really
well
balanced
and
unique
a
bit
of
an
ommegang
style
going
on
here
which
is
fine
by
me
the
chocolate
is
obvious
but
not
over
done
really
perfect
balance
of
flavors
great
brew
i
was
disappointed
by
this
offering
from
boulevard
which
i
was
really
looking
forward
to
trying
i
just
didnt
taste
the
chocolate
as
much
as
i
should
have
reviews
were
pretty
hit
or
miss
and
i
knew
that
before
i
bought
it
but
was
hoping
it
would
be
more
of
a
hit
for
me
oh
well
ill
try
another
smokestack
series
release
eventually
since
most
of
the
rest
of
them
appear
to
have
been
more
successful

b
i
have
never
had
a
more
interesting
and
conflicting
beer
if
this
tasted
anything
like
the
aroma
it
would
have
been
a
drain
pour
yet
the
appearance
flavor
and
mouthfeel
all
redeem
this
thing
being
heralded
as
a
chocolate
ale
i
was
expecting
a
dark
brown
or
black
colored
beer
so
what
appeared
was
surprise
number
1
the
smell
really
gave
me
the
heebiejeebies
as
it
smelled
nothing
like
i
would
expect
for
a
chocolate
ale
and
expected
some
kind
of
sour
winevinegar
flavored
beer
surprise
number
two
lo
and
behold
the
flavor
was
exceptional
smooth
soft
and
subtly
chocolate
overall
nothing
at
all
like
what
the
aroma
suggested
surprise
number
three
i
cant
get
over
the
extremely
weird
smell
but
with
everything
else
considered
this
is
a
very
tasty
fine
looking
beverage
a
conundrum
with
depth
complexity
and
surprises
overall
not
quite
sure
what
to
make
of
this
i
know
this
beer
is
eagerly
anticipated
in
kansas
city
each
year
when
it
is
released
but
i
find
the
aftertaste
so
offputting
that
i
can
barely
bring
myself
to
have
another
sip
now
that
i
have
finished
my
notes

strangely
peanut

fits
the

overall
more

otherwise
weak

and
blend
this
beer
does
not
live
up
to
the
hype
total

o
no

that
should
be
enough
to
deter
any
drinker
with
the
literary
aptitude
to
read
a
bottle
i
cant
say
in
good
conscience
that
it
is
a
horrible
beer
but
it
is
quite
poor
i
feel
that
my

have
been
ransacked
that
ive

the
feel
is
this
beers
worst
aspect
its
not
clean
though

astringency
it
ends
with
lots

graininess
and
it
cant
quite
seem

out
whether
its

this

im
pretty

this
beer
is
well
past
its
prime
though
ill
never
know
based
on
this
experience
i
wouldnt
want
to
try
hlv
again
but
its
probably
not
normally
this
unpleasant
trader
joes
offers
this
beer
for
2
and
some
change
that
already
makes
it
a
great
bargain
nice

good
retention
good
roasty
malt
taste
with
hints
of
chocolate
and
7
abv
for

perfect
for
when
im
broke
and
want
a
quality
beer
if
the
price
was
ever
raised
to
twice
that
amount
i
would
probably
still
buy
it
o
overall
it
was
only
two
bucks
which
is
well
worth
the
price
its
not
outstanding
or
anything
but
if
the
price
is
right
the
price
is
right
this
is
my
first
go
with
a
strong
ale
and
this
particular
version
was
somewhat
reminiscent
of
a
weaker
stout
with
a
black
ale
body
the
flavors
were
a
bit
one
dimensional
but
passible
however
the
body
was
too
thin
and
the
smell
wasnt
much
better
than
a
macro
i
expected
more
from
this
beer
perhaps
simply
because
it
comes
in
a
bomber
i
think
i
may
have
picked
this
up
a
trader
joes
anyhow
i
dont
foresee
myself
getting
this
again
unless
it
is
under
2
a
bottle
life
is
too
short
to
repeatedly
buy
costly
mediocre
beers
taste
is
metallic
dried
fruit
and
toasted
barley
up
front
and
sweet
with
slightly
drier
spicy
finish
feel
is
solid
and
full
not
watery
not
oily
it
is
simple
but
very
enjoyable
o
decent
brew
good
flavors

aromas
with
enough
alcohol
to
make
it
interesting
c
a
22
oz
bomber
clear
garnet
brown
with
a
very
nice
head
good

it
may
be
an
american
strong
ale
but
it
has
a
decidedly
english
aroma
toffee
brown
bread
and
yeast
fruitiness
a
hint
of
alcohol
and
coffee
taste
follows
the
nose
like
an
english
strong
ale
but
hoppier
still
earthy
but
bigger
lots
of
toasty
malt
with
caramel
and
light
fruitiness
dry
finish
with
lingering
notes
of
gain
grains
and
earth
feel
is
soft
and
supple
with
a
surprising
lightness
a
solid
tasty
beer
at
just
over
two
bucks
for
a
bottle
it
is
an
outstanding
value
o
mehhh
nothing
stands
out
very
plain
brew
o
there
are
some
nice
soft
malt
flavors
but
the
bitterness
overpowers
it
and
makes
it
a
bit
tough
to
finish
very
surprised
that
i
enjoyed
this
as
much
as
i
did
sorry
boatswain
overall
an
excellent
beer
for
the
price
just
not
my

style

for
the
price
2
50
a
1
pt
6
oz
bottle
at
trader
joes
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
and
the
7
abv
does
add
a
nice
layer
of
complexity
and
flavor
however
the
beer
is
somewhat
weak
and
watery
and
largely
overpowered
by
grapefruit
rind
so
that
the
entire
experience
is
overly
bitter
masking
the
nice
sugars
underneath
o
starts
off
pretty
good
but
rapidly
wears
out
its
welcome
perhaps
a
decent
stepping
stone
to
better
beer
but
difficult
to
recommend
first
sip
shows
a
big
malt
bill
with
caramely
notes
and
a
little
bit
of
roast
unfortunately
it
goes
on
to
reveal
serious
flaws
slightly
spicy
not
necessarily
bad
but
also
cloying
sweetness
bad
on
top
of
rotting
fruit
worse
unlike
the
other
boatswain
beers
ive
tried
recently
theres
definitely
some
flavor
in
here
unfortunately
its
not
very
good
even
if
it
gives
the
impression
the
guys
at
rhinelander
tried
though
not
too
hard
well
maybe
considering
the
price
oh
well
ive
learned
not
to
be
disappointed
o
overall
i
wasnt
expecting
a
game
changer
for
1
99
but
for
the
money
its
not
bad
if
youre
looking
for
a
super
malty
beer
this
one
may
be
worth
a
shot
ive
been
trying
all
of
the
boatswain
beers
that
trader
joes
carries
so
far
so
good
the
hlv
ale
was
very
nice
though
a
little
syrupy
the
flavor
was
good
though
and
the
bitterness
was
at
a
nice
level
for
2
this
beer
is
well
worth
the
money
and
a
nice
find
overall
about
what
i
would
expect
for
a
2
beer
a
decent
strong
brown
ale
nothing
noteworthy
but
nothing
horrible
after
drinking
a
bottle
of
this
the
lasting
bitterness
and
alochol
bite
in
absence
of
anything
else
means
i
wouldnt
buy
it
again
not
bad
an
american
strong
ale
brewed
by
rhinelander
for
trader
joes
its
a
great
value
at
only
1
99
for
a
650
ml
bottle
dark
malts
plenty
of
hops
and
a
7
abv
what
more
do
you
need
dont
expect
something
that
tastes
like
it
came
from
dogfish
head
or
lagunitas
and
you
wont
be
disappointed
a
few
different
tastes
coming
through
with
this
beer
at
the
price
per
22
ounce
bottle
of
this
stuff
its
a
very
worthy
try
although
i
dont
think
ill
make
this
my
regular
drink
overall
a
great
value
for
the
quality
not
the
best
beer
of
this
type
but
im
happy
and
will
come
back
to
it
at
some
point
just
poured
the
rest
of
the
22oz
bottle
into
my
glass
and
looking
forwards
to
it
o
this
is
good
for
its
style
and
good
for
me
pours
a
solid
dark
brown
with
ruby
highlights
when
held
to
light
and
a
huge
tan
head
that
persists
forever
smells
of
toffee
and
brown
sugar
with
an
earthy
mineral
edge
to
provide
some
balance
light
caramel
and
a
hint
of
chocolate
round
out
the
nose
the
flavor
is
a
bit
sweet
with
a
heavy
toffee
and
caramel
up
front
theres
a
weird
back
and
forth
between
malt
and
earthy
mineral
and
metallic
flavors
that
sustains
for
most
of
the
flavor
curve
medium
body
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
and
a
sweet
mineral
water
mouthfeel
not
a
bad
beer
and
it
grew
on
me
a
bit
after
it
warmed
up
i
probably
wouldnt
try
it
again
but
thanks
for
the
opportunity
dave
update
not
sure
if
my
tastes
have
changed
or
if
i
am
tasting
a
subpar
batch
but
i
am
not
enjoying
this
as
much
as
i
did
when
i
first
reviewed
it
tastes
like
bitter
burnt
coffee
no
where
near
the
smoothness
of
a
moose
drool
still
worth
every
penny
of
1
99
but
youd
be
better
of
saving
that
money
and
applying
it
towards
something
more
satisfying
i
almost
want
to
do
a
youtube
review
of
this
just
to
show
people
that
its
not
as
bad
as
people
make
it
out
to
be
i
dont
understand
the
hating
on
boatswain
because
though
its
not
the
greatest
beers
its
also
not
the
worst
poured
a
1
5
beige
velvet
head
of
pretty
long
life
the
body
is
a
dark
burnt
umber
brown
even
when
held
to
the
light
it
smells
mildly
of
sweet
roasted
malt
the
taste
is
a
little
bready
malty
and
has
a
cocoa
after
taste
medium
weight
body
does
betray
the
heavy
lift
vessel
moniker
look
this
doesnt
have
the
impact
of
a
truly
intense
microbrew
but
its
still
enjoyable
and
its
a
good
value
at

a
dark
earthy
brown
amber
with
a
half
finger
light
tan
head
that
dissipates
to
a
patchy
layer
and
slippery
lacing
aroma
of
very
light
toasted

nuts
and
a
spicy
component
similar
to
cinnamon
flavor
subdued

sweet

finishing
sweet
with

and
a
hint
of

aroma
and
flavors
are
attenuated
but
pleasant
medium
bodied
somewhat
like
a
very
light
sweet
porter
the
elements
are
all
here
but
it
needs
a
little
more
flavor
and
integration
no
too
bad
for
the
price
has
a
distinct
malt
syrup
flavor
that
is
uncommon
in
most
beers
i
had
high
hopes
upon
looking
at
this
beer
a
bit
of
nice
foam
atop
a
dark
but
nottoothick
body
once
poured
into
a
glass
its
hard
to
know
what
to
expect
from
it
as
it
really
gives
no
indication
of
what
type
of
beer
it
is
other
than
being
an
ale
but
id
compare
it
most
to
a
porter
a
style
that
im
not
all
that
fond
of
in
general
as
for
the
flavor
i
found
it
pretty
undrinkable
very
malty
and
bittersweet
but
if
you
like
porters
dont
hesitate
to
give
it
a
try
it
was
at
trader
joes
at
a
reasonable
price
2

or
so
for
a
650ml
bottle
overall
a
respectable
and
interesting
asa
with
some
nice
resemblance
to
a

booze
in

finish
lets
try
it
for

good
price
overall
this
is
ok
and
a
decent
enough
value
the
beer
pours
dark
like
motor
oil
and
leaves
a
foamy
head
lingering
on
top
the
smell
is
bready
with
some
darker
chocolaty
notes
it
is
a
smooth
beer
with
a
lot
of
malty
sweetness
unfortunately
i
dont
think
there
are
enough
hops
to
balance
it
out
it
is
a
decent
beer
but
not
one
ill
look
for
again
overall
i
really
dont
know
what
to
say
about
this
beer
its
drinkable
in
the
least
theres
nothing
much
in
terms
of
flavor
to
look
forward
to
so
its
probably
not
going
on
my
buy

o
a
decent

nothing
to
write
home
about

to

with
a
sugary

rich
lingering
slightly
cloyng

strong

in

the

is
not
one
of
my
favorites
though
it
pairs
well
with
toasted

and

chips
how
cheap
this
is
makes
you
want
to
question
the

structure
of
the

however
i
would
recommend
one
of
these
and

trader
joes
beers
get
a
bad
rap
for
being
cheap
contract
brews
while
some
definitely
are
others
like
their
stockyard
oatmeal
stout
are
great
beers
for
the
price
id
put
this
one
in
the
latter
category
despite
boatswain
being
unable
to
correctly
identify
their
products
see
boatswain
ipa
and
dipa
this
is
as
good
as
some
pricier
brews
of
a
similar
dark
strong
stylewhatever
it
is
i
plan
to
go
back
and
get
another
one
or
two
of
these
i
consider
it
a
good
beer
for
the
price
root
beer
cola
and
artificial
sweeteners
come
to
mind
as
the
truer
malt
flavors
and
hop
bitterness
sway
the
residual
flavors
quiver
and
refuse
to
go
away
or
develop
into
firmer
beer
flavor
despite
the
beers
fundamental
problems
it
remains
fairly
rewarding
in
its
balance
and
boldness
the
body
was

not
really
heavy
this
at

approaches
the
style
theres
just
an

and
a
definitive
kick
of
alcohol
the
aftertaste
is
long
lasting
overall
no
date
on
bottle
almost
no
carbonation
and
very
murky
no
hop
bitterness
and
very
very
sweet
lots
of
malt
for
sure
but
pretty
one
noted
mouthfeel
was
very
cloying
and
sweet
i
suspect
it
was
a
very
old
bottle
im
not
sure
if
i
got
a
bad
bottle
or
not
but
my
beer
had
a
metallic
aftertaste
that
was
unpleasant
it
was
also
too
sweet
and
syrupy
for
me
not
awful
but
i
wont
drink
it
again
somehow
i
managed
to
completely
freeze
a
bottle
of
this
for
a
night
so
theres
no
telling
if
the
thawed
version
will
still
deliver
the
typical
knockout
experience
poured
in
to
a
new
belgium
tulip
the
exceptionally
murky
ruby
red
grapefruit
colored
beer
produced
little
head
no
lacing
and
left
only
some
shiny
hop
oils
on
the
surface
under
the
light
the
drink
slightly
resembles
a
stiff
bloody
mary
minus
the
celery
stalk
theres
lots
of
aromatic
biscuit
malts
in
the
nose
with
some
lemon
citrus
hop
sweet
flavors
come
to
the
fore
with
a
nice
biscuit
backbone
the
counterpunch
is
a
minty
orange
zest
hop
bite
that
keeps
it
in
balance
the
bitterness
linger
a
bit
melding
with
a
caramel
sugar
sweetness
the
finish
is
pretty
juicy
the
alcohol
is
certainly
there
but
it
remains
understated
for
such
a
strong
ale
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
robust
with
a
gentle
yet
spry
carbonation
well
im
glad
to
see
that
my
freezer
faux
pas
did
not
damage
the
beer
it
delivered
exactly
what
i
have
come
to
know
from
this
brew
a
very
tasty
wellbalanced
american
ale
that
will
knock
you
on
your
ass
o
this
is
a
big
malty
brew
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
but
it
is
not
in
my
wheelhouse
serving
type
bottle
o
this
is
just
flat
out
bad
its
not
a
good
strong
ale
nor
a
good
double
ipa
mouthfeel
is
neutral
for
an
ale
a
bit
biting
from
some
thinner
carbonatoin
but
not
unpleasant
a
goblet
eh
that
sounds
like
a
challenge
i
have
not
broken
out
a
goblet
in
a
while
but
i
am
happy
to
take
up
the
goblet
gauntlet
holy
heavy
foam
batman
my
goblet
may
have
proven
stronger
than
their
strong
ale
but
i
backed
off
and
allowed
it
to
settle
some
before
proceeding
i
have
to
admit
though
that
the
density
of
the
head
was
phenomenal
creating
a
mound
of
dense
rocky
lighttan
head
with
excellent
retention
nose
was
rich
with
caramel
and
toffee
notes
as
well
as
a
decent
alcohol
burn
that
tickled
my
nostrils

mouthfeel
seemed
to
be
on
the
thin
side
and
man
it
brought
the
heat
right
from
the
outset
this
would
have
been
illegal
to
make
and
sell
in
south
carolina
up
until
recently
and
they
seem
to
be
making
up
for
lost
time
i
hold
with
my
initial
assessment
about
it
being
rich
and
malty
sweet
but
i
was
not
getting
much
in
terms
of
hops
my
goblet
was
ringed
with
dense
lacing
as
i
drank
phew
finish
kept
up
the
heat
then
slowly
reduced
to
near
candylike
sweetness
one
of
these
will
be
plenty
thanks
this
beer
was
sampled
both
fresh
and
after
2
yearsage
neither
version
was
particularly
notable
however
age
did
clean
up
some
muddled
flavors
and
added
to
complexity
and
the
aroma
alcohol
did
tone
down
as
well
both
versions
scored
similarly
dont
drink
this
one
quickly
or
the
fusel
alcohol
will
make
you
choke
not
a
bad
sipper
though
rjt
overall
this
is
a
solid
beer
from
a
brewery
id
never
heard
of
but
id
drink
again
my
rating
may
even
be
low
because
im
not
sure
i
had
the
freshest
bottle
as
much
as
i
think
the
catchall
category
of
american
strong
ale
is
a
bit
stupid
i
guess
id
compare
this
to
a
poor
mans
arrogant
bastard
but
i
love
arrogant
bastard
so
this
is
worth
a
try
thanks
to
illucium
for
the
sample
overall
this
is
a
perfect
strong
ale
with
great
balance
nothing
for
amateurs
or
beginners
here
if
you
like
the
dark
side
definitely
give
this
one
a
try
youll
be
dragged
in
by
the
smooth
yet
bitter
taste
of
this
one
nice
weight
not
too
heavy
not
too
light
if
i
can
find
another
single
to
put
in
a
make
your
own
six
pack
then
i
am
all
over
it
and
its
really
good
for
its
8
5
abv
overall
i
know
this
sounds
contradictory
but
the
beer
was
a
more
satisfying
experience
as
a
whole
than
it
would
seem
from
the
individual
scores
gonna
have
to
revisit
this
to
make
sure
i
give
it
a
fair
shot
poured
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
orange
copper
with
a
creamy
white
head
lots
of
tiny
bubbles
and
some
floaters
the
head
sticks
around
for
a
while
the
beer
smells
nice
and
malty
with
some
sweetness
the
beer
tastes
bready
with
some
hint
of
bread
crust
and
some
toffee
and
earthiness
the
body
is
medium
to
full
with
moderate
carbonation
the
finish
is
a
little
dry
but
it
drinks
pretty
well
for
the
higher
gravity
this
is
a
very
good
beer
a
decent
beer
the
alcohol
is
nicely
matched
with
the
flavor
profile
so
would
be
worth
having
on
tap
i
have
had
this
on
tap
before
but
this
is
the
first
i
have
had
bell
ringer
in
a
bottle
it
pours
cloudy
and
brown
with
a
nice
almost
red
tint
the
smell
is
almost
non
existent
its
not
unpleasant
just
not
very
potent
the
taste
starts
off
pretty
hoppy
and
finishes
with
a
strong
alcohol
finish
i
like
this
beer
it
lives
up
to
its
name
overall
lives
up
to
its
name
this
thing
will
knock
you
around
a
little
bit
but
a
good
offering
from
a
solid
sc
brewer
an
above
average
beer
that
was
not
exactly
well
executed
there
is
potential
there
that
was
not
fully
realized
in
this
example
o
this
turned
out
to
be
a
nice
strong
ale
i
was
a
little
skeptical
after
the
aroma
but
the
taste
mouthfeel
and
look
were
great
the
taste
is
maybe
not
as
complex
or
layered
as
better
strong
ales
but
the
beer
is
still
very
tasty
the
mouthfeel
is
full
and
creamy
and
the
spice
and
alcohol
heat
combination
makes
for
a
great
finish
this
is
definitely
better
than
i
expected
it
to
be
coming
from
spartanburg
sorry
sparkle
city
tasty
and
drinkable
beer
o
when
i
was
given
this
bottle
i
was
told
it
was
a
style
of
its
own
and
i
would
have
to
agree
with
that
i
see
the
notes
say
an
imperial
esb
but
the
bright
citrus
flavors
go
against
that
other
than
the
light
nose
i
enjoyed
this
one
pours
a
hazy
light
amber
color
with
a
thin
white
quickly
disappearing
head
aroma
of
malt
and
citrus
with
a
little
pine
taste
is
very
complex
of
malty
sweetness
citrus
piney
hop
bitterness
well
balanced
ends
with
a
slight
alcohol
note
and
a
lingering
bite
of
hops
medium
carbonation
and
a
full
body
slightly
creamy
mouthfeel
this
beer
is
very
interesting
and
keeps
me
coming
back
for
more
and
more
sips
easy
drinking
and
a
very
well
done
strong
imperial
bitter
i
will
probably
be
having
this
beer
again
and
would
recommend
for
those
that
love
bitters
or
pale
ales
especially
pours
a
murky
honey
brown
with
a
1
inch
foamy
orangekhaki
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
citrus
fruit
citrus
zest
brown
sugar
and
malt
taste
is
of
candied
citrus
zest
brown
sugar
and
toasted
malt
there
is
a
mild
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
overall
this
is
a
pretty
tasty
offering
i
would
gladly
enjoy
this
one
again
overall
this
would
be
more
of
an
american
strong
pale
ale
if
this
style
was
even
recognized
a
far
cry
from
the
belgian
strong
dark
ales
and
stone
or
other
top
american
strong
ales
a
malty
strong
ale
caramel
breads
brown
sugar
real
bready
on
the
aroma
not
much
for
a
hop
bite
which
is
fine
with
me
i
like
how
this
drinks
not
immense
in
stature
maybe
high
side
of
medium
bodied
finishes
with
just
a
little
hop
twang
but
this
is
a
maltforward
ale
all
the
way
with
big
bready
caramelbrown
sugar
notes
this
is
a
rather
complex
and
flavorful
beer
but
unfortunately
there
are
a
few
off
flavors
in
my
opinion
the
cherry
in
both
the
nose
and
taste
are
a
bit
medicinal
which
over
power
the
bready
malts
and
nice
dark
alefruits
theres
a
nice
underlying
hop
character
which
lends
a
little
balance
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
a
bit
of
a
more
balanced
flavor
would
really
make
this
an
awesome
ale
as
it
stands
its
worth
a
try
but
ill
probably
avoid
it
in
the
future
i
poured
this
beer
into
a
pint
glass
it
has
a
burnt
orange
color
body
with
no
head
just
a
real
thin
lace
around
the
edge
of
the
glass
the
smell
is
of
sweet
malt
and
a
little
bit
of
fruit
the
taste
is
maltey
and
tart
fruit
i
dont
get
a
lot
of
hop
taste
just
a
tiny
bit
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
the
mouth
feel
is
ok
kinda
leaves
a
after
taste
in
my
mouth
overall
this
ia
a
ok
beer
in
my
book
im
not
a
big
malt
loving
guy
o
this
beer
is
not
too
difficult
to
drink
considering
the
strength
the
alcohol
is
noticeable
but
doesnt
detract
from
the
taste
its
a
real
guzzler
coming
out
of
the
bottle
so
you
need
to
pour
it
carefully
so
you
dont
get
a
glassful
of
head
the
subtle
flavors
and
aromas
actually
end
up
working
in
the
beers
favor
this
isnt
an
intense
and
aggressive
beer
but
its
well
crafted
and
dangerously
drinkable
o
malt
and
caramel
with
great
hop
balance
this
beer
blurs
the
lines
of
what
it
actually
is
but
its
interesting
to
drink
and
one
that
keeps
you
entertained

decent
overall
impression
im
not

what
the
style
is
on
this
one
not
quite
barleywine
not
quite
dead
dipa
strong
ale
perhaps
in
any
case
i
think
it
lives
up
to
its
namesake
quite
well
worth
a
shot
at
least
if
you
come
across
a
single
bottle
c
o
bland
and
uninspired
still
no
word
on
the
style
or
what
actual
ingredients
or
processes
are
involved
ah
well
we
can
only
let
our
tastebuds
be
our
guide
and
this
is
delicious
stuff
overall
very
pleasantly
surprised
lots
of
hop
flavor
mixed
with
some
spices
reminiscent
of
a
belgian
ale
grab
one
of
these
overall
impression
not
sure
what
the
style
is
but
very
strong
maltiness
and
caramel
all
the
way
through
it
says
strong
ale
on
here
but
i
would
say
it
is
either
an
esb
or
an
american
brown
ale
with
double
the
strength
definitely
a
favorite
brown
ale
for
me
and
would
go
back
to
if
available
would
like
to
try
more
from
this
brewery
also
smell
is
not
very
tropical
but
a
tiny
bit
piny
there
is
a
tiny
bit
of
sweetness
from
the
malt
bill
to
be
sure
really
more
of
a
little
pinemalt
but
not
much
tropical
really
an
ok
beer
but
nothing
special
o
a
tasty
beer
in
the
style
of
an
american
brown
ale
rather
ordinary
beer
though
yes
lots
of
hops
and
malt
not
so
well
integrated
ok
drinkability
to
get
the
hops
a
better
malting
would
improve
drinkability
little

the

overall
not

but
not
too
memorable
either
i
dont
think
i
would
try
this
one
again
a
fairly
unique
strong
ale
and
one
that
i
would
like
to
revisit
again
sometime
overall
this
beer
is
pretty
good
nothing
incredibly
special
if
there
was
a
style
called
imperial
amber
my
main
reservation
about
this
beer
is
that
it
seemed
a
bit
roughly
put
together
foamy
though
caramel
but
not
sure
i
would
chase
after
the
beer
in
a
trade
and
a
little
more
malt
no
hops
to
speak
of
the
malt
kind
of
beats

have
tried

better

definitely
reminds
me
of
a
malt
liquor
does
not
have
the
toasted
malty
or
caramelly
goodness
that
comes
with
an
allgrain

so
adjuncts
are
definitely
a
big
factor
in
this
brew
tastes
like

not
rice

im
very
disappointed
by
this
because
i
bought
it
on
a
whim
from
trader
joes
and
was
excited
to
try
it
should
have
gone
with
the
session
lager
for
the
same
price
instead
of
this
inferior
brew
overall
i
wouldnt
believe
this
beer
cost
1
30bottle
not
arrogant
bastard
the
pinnacle
of
american
strong
ales
but
for
the
price
its
worth
having
a
6
pack
of
these
around
taste
is
also
very
malty
with
toasted
grain
and
a
touch
of
fruitiness
i
also
get
some
honey
and
caramel
seems
overall
to
be
too
sweet

a

return

ale
is
a
lively
golden
ale
topped
with

it

it
has
a
sweet

sour
malt
flavor
its
tangy
and
the
bitterness
is
ample
and
wooden
i
guess
this
is
a
scotch
ale
for
a

is

as
a

it

the
verdict
pretty
good

another
one
of

joes
line
of

beers
this
one
is
my

so
far
easily
worth

you
get

but
is
probably
from
mendocino
not
good
just
slightly
more
flavor
than
bmc
products
no
adjunct
flavors
but
i
would
prefer
a
beer
with
adjuncts
that
was

overall

mess
c
poured

a

beer

pint
glass
pours
a
medium
golden
amber
with
a
fine
thin
offwhite
head
with
good
retention
and
light
lacing
mild
aroma
of
sweet
malt
and
a
hint
of
hops
kind
of
pleasant
but
very
attenuated
flavor
is
sweet
malt
that
seems
artificially
over
sweetened
develops
a
hop
bitterness
with
no
herbal
hop
flavors
finishing
with
a
slightly
harsh
hop
bitterness
the
flavor
wasnt
bad
but
seemed
unbalanced
medium
bodied
with
a
hint
of
creaminess
approaches
a
quite
nice
mouth
feel
an
unusual
ale
that
i
had
no
problem
finishing
but
will
probably
not
visit
again
this
bottle
brewed
by

brewery
for

so
it
is
likely
made
by
a
diffferent

open

overall
drinkability
not
an
amazing
beer
but
it
hits
some
nice

notes
that
provides
a
good
balance
overall
a
very
sweet
beer
lacking
the
malt
complexity
of
most
strong
ales
and
lacking
the
hop
flavor
and
bitterness

inch
foamy

to

down
smell
is
of
toasted

and
sugar
taste
is
of
toasted

burnt
sugar
and
some
medicinal
and
herbal
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
weird
and
somewhat
harsh
bitterness
on
the
palate
that
lingers
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
average
beer
with
a
weird
finish
but
i
am
glad
i
finally
tried
this
one
o
i
had
high
expectations
from
the
appearance
but
i
was
let
down
in
pretty
much
every
other
aspect
way
too
candylike
in
the
sweetness
possibly
a
good
gateway
beer
for
people
who
dislike
hops
overall
lots
of
almosts
for
this
one
the
flavor
up
front
is
good
but
forgoten
by
the
sour
finish
the
fuller
body
is
erased
by
the
offputting
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
tolerable
medium
light
body
with
moderate
carbonation
cannot
cover
up
the
taste
what
is
in
this
brew
perhaps
its
namesake
do
not
buy
i
had
this
beer
as
part
of
a
trader
joes
grab
bag
served
cool
in
a
pint
glass
from
the
bottle
nothing
on
the
label
tells
me
what
to
expect
here
pours
gold
body
with
a
white
head
smelly
like
fruit
stone
some
grain
tastes
like
a
sticke
alt
bier
here
malty
with
that
fruit
stone
taste
to
subdue
the
sweetness
very
unidimensional
not
alot
here
not
a
bad
beer
but
just
nothing
to
write
home
about
wow
what
a
boring
and
tasteless
beer
its
hard
to
get
a
i
poured
this
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
50
degrees
the
beer
poured
a
cloudy
beer
with
a
very
nice
white
poofy
head
i
had
great
expectations
however
the
beer
had
a
yeasty
smell
that
was
okay
with
me
but
that
sour
taste
that
came
with
it
was
terrible
not
for
me
and
i
will
not
buy
again
i
suggest
avoiding
this
one
it
is
drinkable
but
no
need
to
waste
your
money
trader
joes
has
other
much
better
options
for
the
same
price
it
is
also
weird
how
much
alcohol
is
detectible
for
only
being
7
o
six
bucks
for
a
sixer
sounds
great
but
a
couple
of
more
dollars
would
make
a
world
of
difference
not
worth
it
imo
golden
color
with
a
huge
head
that
leaves
very
nice
sticky
lacing
smells
like
yeast
and
alcohol
thats
really
about
it
taste
is
similar
but
fortunately
tastes
better
than
the
smell
maybe
a
slight
fruitiness
and
some
hops
abv
is
very
noticeable
light
mouthfeel
lightly
carbonated
overall
this
tastes
like
a
stronger
version
of
something
from
ab
no
depth
really
no
flavors
except
the
2
previously
mentioned
but
itll
getcha
drunk
poured
a
light
amber
with
a
head
that
built
then
lasted
leaving
a
pretty
good
amount
of
lacing
the
smell
is
bready
with
a
bit
of
fruit
and
even
in
the
smell
the
abv
becomes
apparent
in
the
taste
the
only
thing
seeming
to
stand
out
was
the
alcohol
which
is
undeniable
going
down
the
sweetness
is
pretty
upfront
with
the
alcohol
with
bitterness
making
its
way
near
the
end
slick
mouthfeel
not
entirely
sure
what
to
make
of
the
abv
but
with
the
price
tag
a
few
of
these
would
make
an
elite
replacement
for
the
ubiquitous
40
oz
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
typical
amber
color
with
a
light
tan
colored
head
on
top
the
head
doesnt
leave
much
in
way
of
lacing
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
a
malty
and
a
bit
hoppy
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
a
little
all
over
the
place
i
have
a
hard
time
figureing
this
one
out
i
think
its
hoppy
and
its
got
malts
in
there
too
but
there
is
other
stuff
that
i
cant
grasp
the
mouthfeel
wasnt
as
thick
as
i
was
hoping
for
and
overall
i
feel
its
just
an
average
brew
to
say
the
least
wouldnt
seek
this
one
out
again
i
thought
the
color
would
be
a
lot
darker
than
it
was
but
it
was
intriguing
enough
it
almost
tasted
like
it
was
trying
to
be
a
guiness
knockoff
but
wasnt
nearly
as
good
thats
not
to
say
it
wasnt
a
good
beer
i
sensed
a
little
toffee
sweetness
with
malt
boldness
i
dont
know
why
so
many
souls
hate
this
stuff
it
would
be
the
greatest
malt
liquor
on
the
planet
if
you
bought
it
in
a
flashy
tall
can
id
blind
taste
this
with
the
dogfish
or
the
rogue
malts
and
see
who
comes
out
best
o
ok
as
an
economical
strong
ale
i
do
enjoy
the
random
finds
at
the
local
tjs
this
one
pours
a
clear
brass
topped
by
a
finger
of
lightlyoff
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
flowers
mild
orange
rind
lemon
peel
and
a
very
faint
hint
of
caramel
once
things
hit
the
tongue
pain
begins
something
akin
to
a
mixture
of
balsa
vinyl
mandarin
orange
syrup
and
cotton
candy
is
the
only
way
i
can
describe
the
taste
whats
worse
though
is
that
this
melange
instantly
made
me
grimace
in
mild
pain
seriously
boo
this
immediately
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
sorta
smooth
feel
point
are
deducted
for
the
pain
though
overall
i
could
not
stand
this
beer
im
not
sure
what
it
is
exactly
but
it
hurt
me
deeply
i
feel
traumatized
by
this
bottle
overall
not
too
impressed
its
drinkable
enough
nothing
youll
run
to
the
bathroom
expelling
just
average
not
a
bad
value
at
trader

is
lighter
than
i
expected

clear
light

basically
white
thin
tiny
bubbled

is
well
this
doesnt
really
smell
like
anything
maybe
some
light
graininess
mixed
with
corniness
tastes
about
the
same
a
bit
disappointing
mouthfeel
is
slightly
syrupy
overall
not
so
great
just
kind
of
a
yeasty
low
hop
average
bitterness
beer
malt
profile
is
unremarkable
doesnt
contribute
anything
doesnt
offer
anything
specifically
to
the
taste
really
kind
of
a
weird
conglomeration
of
nothing
that
stands
out
not
thick
not
hoppy
not
really
all
that
bitter
no
roast
just
kind
of
a
hodgepodge
batch
t
this
tastes
way
more
like
a
malt
liquor
to
me
sweet
and
not
clean
at
all
as
it
warms
it
develops
a
very
coppery
taste
and
the
yeast
begins
to
come
out
a
little
too
much
i
would
definitely
avoid
this
taste
is
appleytoasty
grain
bread
some
vague
spicy
pepperygrassy
hop
bitterness
which
soon
tends
to
dominate
and
be
a
bit
sharp
while
becoming
steadily
more
bland
and
simple
its
pretty
good
but
not
very
and
is
not
particularly
drinkable
it
seems
rather
like
a
lowgrade
maibock
or
hoppybitter
malt
liquor
mouthfeel
is
dry
and
a
little
gritty
not
very
lively
overall
its
an
ok
beer
overall
an
ok
beer
probably
wouldnt
buy
it
myself
but
my
buddy
said
i
had
to
try
it
poured
this
american
strong
ale
out
of
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
poured
a
hazy
pale
color
it
produced
a
nice
head
but
head
retention
was
poor
lacing
was
average
the
aroma
dominated
by
dough
and
not
much
else
the
body
of
this
strong
ale
was
light
the
beer
was
sweet
a
little
bit
of
malt
and
not
much
hop
bitterness
to
speak
of
the
beer
finishs
dry
product
of
the
high
of
alcohol
very
average
beer
i
wont
seek
this
out
in
the
future
poured
a
pretty
standard
straw
color
with
a
little
orange
to
it
quite
a
bit
of
big
fluffy
white
head
on
it
strong
doughiness
on
the
nose
with
some
malt
coming
through
a
bit
of
hops
as
well
taste
is
not
real
great
tastes
sweet
up
front
with
a
funky
bitter
finish
light
mouthfeel
this
beer
is
pretty
drinkable
its
not
a
bad
beer
for
the
price
d
drinkable
but
not
really
memorable
this
beer
is
worth
giving
a
try
but
you
probably
wont
find
anymore
in
my
beer
fridge
any
time
soon
i
like
the
small
bottle
reminds
me
of
the
henry
weinhards
bottles
not
a
great
beer
the
bottle
came
from
a
friend
who
said
it
had
been
unintentionally
aged
in
her
fridge
but
other
reviews
suggest
thats
not
the
issue
here
purchased
6pack
from
trader
joes
to
try
not
expecting
much
poured
bright
golden
with
a
foamy
head
aroma
is
light
dominated
by
malt
and
yeast
very
smooth
sweet
malty
flavor
upfront
with
some
light
but
pleasant
hops
at
the
finish
quite
drinkable
for
the
price
overall
decent
it
was
fairly
mild
and
refreshing
despite
the
the
higher
abv
for
the
price
though
its
a
respectable
choice
if
a
really
good
brew
is
outside
the
budget
the
fat
weasel
beer
is
nothing
special
but
for
the
price
its
totally
solid
trader
joes
carries
it
for
6
it
has
a
good
golden
color
it
pours
with
very
little
head
the
drinkability
of
this
inexpensive
strong
ale
wins
it
for
me
the
taste
is
a
little
sweet
but
solid
note
not
bad
and
better
then
i
expected
but
nothing
really
exceptional
d
nice
drinkable
beer
kind
of
surprised
by
the
high
abv
creeps
up
on
me
would
be
better
and
more
well
balanced
at
about
5
5
6
just
my
opinion
drinkability
they
definitely
went
a
bit
over
the
top
with
the
alcohol
content
here
maybe
shooting
for
5
percent
would
have
kept
this
one
more
drinkable
and
not
ruined
the
flavor
d
i
am
debating
whether
or
not
i
want
to
finish
it
overall
overall
the
beer
was
decent
slight
citrus
and
hops
reminds
me
more
of
an
ipa
than
an
american
strong
ale
for
1
at
trader
joes
its
a
good
deal
for
drinking
in
quantity
but
there
are
definitely
better
strong
ales
out
there
this
would
be
a
great
bridge
ale
for
the
many
drinkers
of
the
big
3
ab
coors
miller
in
getting
them
a
better
quality
beverage
finishes
slightly
bitter
and
fairly
dry
while
the
flavors
dont
all
come
together
quite
perfectly
theres
a
fair
amount
of
heft
here
and
perhaps
a
bit
more
than
i
was
expected
with
the
huge
herbal
component
think
of
this
as
the
rolling
rock
of
sizable
pale
ales
i
like
this
beer
i
think
its
a
real
easy
to
drink
light
colored
brew
that
i
would
probably
drink
more
often
if
i
could
locate
some
closer
to
central
wisconsin
my
lovely

was
kind
enough
to
bring

still
inviting

with
a
fairly
thick
though
not
persistent
white
head
flavor
is
malty
a
little
crisp
slightly
fruity
and
slightly

texture
is
smooth
somewhat
thick
and
just
a
little
tingly
not
too
shabby
this
was
contract
brewed
by
augusta
schell
in
new
ulmmn
i
found
this
to
be
a
nice
drinkable
brew
for
the
summer
patio
d
this
strikes
me
as
the
craft
beer
drinkers
alternative
to
malt
liquor
cheap
doesnt
taste
very
good
and
packs
an
alcoholic
punch
if
thats
what
youre
into
check
it
out
not
really
for
me
not
much
here
but
its
certainly
not
objectionable
the
abv
might
knock
you
over
if
not
taken
seriously
want
to
hear
something
totally
out
of
line
i
think
my
favorite
way
to
drink
this
one
is
on
a
hot
muggy
dc
summer
evening
in
a
glass
with
plenty
of
ice
cubes
crazy
i
know
d
this
is
an
interesting
beer
classified
as
an
american
strong
ale
it
seems
to
fit
its
fairly
strong
and
boozy
but
not
very
hoppy
so
it
fits
as
a
strong
ale
drinkability
it
was
ok
ill
drink
it
again
but
mostly
because
of
the
price
i
paid
not
because
of
the
quality
d
it
tastes
like
a
really
high
quality
malt
liquor
and
i
mean
that
as
a
compliment
this
tastes
like
what
strong
brew
should
taste
like
but
i
cant
help
thinking
that
maybe
this
should
be
in
the
bspa
category
thats
just
the
flavor
profile
that
im
getting
not
bad
stuff
honestly
id
buy
it
again
at
this
price
but
put
it
on
the
same
shelf
as
duvel
and
there
is
no
contest
it
has
a
very
metallic
aroma
which
pretty
much
overrides
all
other
odors
there
is
a
mild
hint
of
malt
i
cannot
say
there
were
anything
really
as
far
as
head
just
a
few
bubbles
there
was
no
lace
to
speak
of
either
just
a
ring
the
body
is
a
golden
orange
color
with
some
bubbles
the
taste
is
metallic
at
first
but
it
is
candy
and
cereal
like
as
well
it
has
a
warming
feeling
to
it
it
has
a
dog
food
like
aftertaste
overall
it
is
a
thin
beer
do
give
this
beer
a
good
for
drinkability
because
its
sure
to
give
you
a
nice
buzz
if
thats
what
youre
after
for
1bottle
if
you
frequent
your
nearest
trader
joes
not
bad
but
it
falls
short
of
what
i
expect
from
a
strong
ale
still
overall
it
was
enjoyable
pours
a
strawgolden
color
with
just
a
tad
of
haze
a
thick
frothy
2
finger
white
head
tops
the
beer
smells
of
corn
malt
and
cereal
grains
first
sip
is
more
reminiscent
of
an
american
light
lager
than
an
ale
mouthfeel
is
quite
good
creamy
and
well
carbonated
the
7
abv
is
well
hidden
not
too
bad
just
not
very
good
i
will
definatly
buy
this
again
a
great
beer
when
i
dont
want
a
rich
hefe
or
belgian
ale
which
are
my
preference
d
drinkability
is
down
due
to
the
highalcohol
attributes
maybe
you
should
just
drink
the
first
half
and
drink
it
very
cold
not
impressed
but
then
i
didnt
really
expect
to
be
bit
lager
like
on
the
nose
towards
the
end
of
the
beer
pours
a
clear
golden
yellow
14
inch
head
with
slight
retention
and
no
lacing
smells
of
a
lager
with
some
sweet
malt
and
possibly
some
adjunct
fits
the
style
has
a
sweet
malty
flavor
with
a
lager
background
there
is
a
nasty
kick
to
this
beer
similar
to
vodka
a
strong
puckering
overall
this
beer
started
out
with
some
potential
and
then
quickly
went
down
hill
until
it
ended
up
with
that
nasty
sour
kick
poured
a
deep
gold
nice
head
fair
lace
and
carbonation
mild
malt
on
the
nose
hints
of
hops
but
nothing
overbearing
taste
is
smooth
a
mild
hint
of
malt
giving
it
a
sweet
feel
and
a
bitter
hop
finish
well
this
brew
didnt
do
much
for
me
kind
of
one
dimensional
at
best
looks
good
but
looks
can
be
deceiving
this
poured
a
bright
clear
gold
with
white
head
it
smelled
like
sweet
and
creamy
yeast
with
a
bit
of
honey
malt
and
lemon
hops
it
tasted
like
creamy
yeast
and
sweet
lemon
hops
with
a
bit
of
copper
hops
and
fresh
wheat
malt
it
was
oily
with
a
bit
of
carbonation
and
had
a
mildly
bitter
aftertaste
overall
this
was
very
clean
and
easy
to
drink
it
had
nice
body
and
had
a
simple
and
enjoyable
flavor
this
just
seemed
like
it
was
missing
something
which
makes
it
very
forgettable
the
weasel
needs
more
kick
d
somewhat
drinkable
for
the
abv
malty
and
alcohol
isnt
well
hidden
solid
beer
but
not
fantastic
pours
a
slightly
hazy
yellow
with
a
fluffy
head
that
falls
quickly
to
decent
lacing
slightly
sour
aroma
like
a
mix
of
wheat
and
pilsener
malt
the
flavor
is
decent
a
little
sour
some
slight
hop
bitterness
on
the
end
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
slightly
clingy
emphasizing
the
very
slight
bitterness
down
the
throat
on
teh
finish
overall
however
this
is
a
drinkable
but
entirely
unmemorable
beer
this
beer
almost
brings
to
mind
a
very
very
light
stout
the
brew
holds
a
bit
sweet
with
a
very
light
coffee
tone
in
the
back
although
its
so
light
i
admit
this
could
be
my
imagination
in
the
end
its
a
passable
but
not
altogether
glorious
ale
you
get
your
moneys
worth
i
suppose
but
you
can
certainly
find
others
to
enjoy
the
finest
qualities
this
brew
possess
are
a
moderately
hilarious
title
and
picture
combined
with
a
hearty
7
1
alcohol
by
volume
content
another
trader
joes
beer
that
is
far
better
than
i
was
expecting
the
aroma
is
a
bit
bland
but
this
is
packed
with
a
surprising
amount
of
flavor
the
strength
of
this
beer
obviously
helps
as
i
was
expecting
this
to
be
around
4
and
not
the
7
2
that
it
is
at
not
quite
something
that
i
can
see
myself
buying
again
but
if
handed
this
at
a
bbq
i
would
be
quite
content
overall
a
decent
brew
that
is
quite
drinkable
and
a
frickin
steal
for
only
a
1
in
boston
i
guess
pretty
much
anywhere
for
that
matter
so
i
had
a
guy
tell
me
the
other
day
that
this
was
his
favorite
ipa
he
mentioned
smutty
ipa
two
hearted
and
loose
cannon
in
the
same
conversation
so
i
kind
of
figured
he
knew
a
bit
more
than
your
average
beer
imbiber
hmmm
not
so
much
i
wouldnt
even
think
of
classifying
this
beer
as
an
ipa
and
have
doubts
that
is
even
an
ale
to
begin
with
other
than
the
packaging
claim
that
is
honestly
to
me
it
comes
across
as
a
hoppy
bock
which
isnt
a
bad
thing
just
completely
unexpected
certainly
there
are
no
hops
in
the
nose
it
is
dominated
by
a
sweet
almost
sticky
aroma
it
is
all
malt
in
the
mouth
as
well
with
an
delayed
bit
of
generic
bittering
midpalate
that
is
then
subsumed
by
a
maplecaramel
finish
down
the
back
of
the
tongue
to
be
honest
i
dont
terribly
dislike
this
beer
and
for
5
99
a
6er
will
probably
pick
up
another
when
i
am
next
in
trader
joes
it
is
one
of
their
many
many
store
brands
but
i
have
not
idea
why
this
guy
thought
it
could
ever
ever
begin
to
stand
in
the
same
race
as
two
hearted
or
smutty
in
the
end
it
is
a
decent
brew
not
obnoxiously
made
with
a
kick
bracing
enough
to
quell
those
friends
of
yours
who
insist
on
only
mbc
but
dude
it
aint
an
ipa
seriously
well
done
beer
way
too
easy
to
drink
decent
body
and
good
carbonation
together
with
a
good
flavor
pan
out
to
a
brew
thats
easy
to
drink
but
nothing
special
thats
all
folks
body
is
full
a
bit
heavy
and
sticky
too
alcohol
and
fruity
maltness
overwhelm
the
hops
are
muted
and
not
balanced
dry
finish
or
so
it
seems
and
then
a
sticky
coating
takes
over
and
wont
go
away
a
good
beer
but
im
glad
my
little
lady
likes
them
more
she
can
finish
off
the
sixpack
reallypretty
good
for
the
money
i
would
probably
drink
it
againbut
not
my
favorite
drinkability
not
only
was
this
my
first
downthedrain
beer
this
was
my
first
practice
the
justwonthe
championshipspray
with
about
three
bottles
beer
this
one
makes
me
stick
to
the
excellent
cheap
wines
that
trader
joes
has
and
leave
the
beer
for
another
time
not
a
bad
beer
especially
for
5

pack
mildly
recommended
this
one
poured
okay
a
copper
color
with
a
touch
of
white
head
on
top
nose
is
weird
but
i
could
tell
right
off
the
bat
it
wasnt
for
me
a
lot
of
alcohol
presence
as
well
as
diacetyl
malt
liquory
as
another
reviewer
observed
taste
is
likewise
its
just
not
pleasant
to
drink
kind
of
biting
hoppiness
then
that
acidic
punch
really
not
good
body
is
alright
although
a
little
thin
overall
i
wont
be
getting
this
one
again
gold
slightly
cloudy
pour
bright
white
medium
lasting
head
smell
is
a
very
slight
touch
of
lager
yeastiness
but
mostly
of
fruity
hops
taste
is
very
bland
watery
and
a
lightly
flavored
hop
finish
nothing
tasted
bad
but
it
was
easily
one
of
the
blandest
beers
ive
ever
had
if
youre
at
trader
joes
and
want
to
pick
up
a
beer
their
id
recommend
the
fat
weasel
pale
ale
over
this
one
would
i
get
this
again
no
will
i
even
finish
this
bottle
since
i
drank
it
out
of
the
bottle
i
didnt
get
to
see
the
beerbut
taste
is
far
more
important
to
me

a

to

but
its
not

the
key
phrase
in
this
offering
is
straight
forward
if
you
want
a
decent
beer
at
a
good
price
and
want
to
kick
start
a
buzz
this
is
your
pick
i
may
pick
it
up
again
but
certainly
not
for
a
while
would
be
a
good
winter
beer
with
its

that
this
is
9
abv
dogfish
head
brewed
american
beauty
with
almond
honey
granola
and
all
american
hops
and
it
sounds

quickly

cap
with

on

palate
it
enters
nutty
and
slightly
sweet
with
honey
and
light
sugars
balanced
by
a
moderate
hop
bitterness
on
the
finish
the
finish
has
an
underlying
layer
of
honey
and
leaves
a
little
honey
stickiness
on
the
lips
the
beer
is
very
creamy
with
above
average
carbonation
stuffed
into
a
medium
full
bodied
beer
the
granola
is
definitely
there
throughout
but
it
is
never
too
much
to
be
cloying
and
is
nicely
balanced
by
the
other
flavors
in
the
beer
it
pairs
well
the
the
background
pale
ale
graham
cracker
flavors
and
is
well
balanced
by
both
the
hop
flavors
and
bitterness
the
alcohol
is
unnoticeable
i
just
have
good
things
to
say
about
this
beer
it
is
very
drinkable
another
reviewer
described
it
as
mild
which
is
accurate
to
be
sure
but
i
think
in
a
good
way
it
is
just
so
well
balanced
top
that
off
with
my
favorite
musicians
furry
friend
and
i
cant
help
but
smile
smile
smile
i
was
expecting
more
from
the
dfh
name
and
price
i
would
plausible
buy
this
again
in
a
4
pack
for
11
but
not
a
16
bomber
overall
i
was
surprised
at
how
mild
this
beer
was
it
was
good
but
very
mild
in
my
opinion
strange
usually
with
off
kilter
strong
ales
especially
old
ales
and
barleywines
i
wind
up
liking
the
beer
more
and
more
as
i
progress
through
the
pint
this
was
the
exact
opposite
it
never
became
bad
but
i
took
my
sweet
time
finishing
it
and
probably
wont
order
it
again
good
but
a
little
sweet
for
my
taste
id
call
the
imperial
pale
ale
description
accurate
calling
it
a
strong
ale
or
barleywine
works
too
its
just
a
big
beer
with
a
lot
of
everything
the
hops
arent
on
par
with
arrogant
bastard
theyre
a
softer
citrus
punch
the
malts
are
toasty
with
a
granolalike
sweetness
or
maybe
im
imagining
that
because
its
on
the
label
very
smooth
and
balanced
for
the
strength
it
feels
at
home
in
a
red
wine
glass
its
a
good
trip
dfh
american
beauty
is
a
sweet
nutty
imperial
ipa
that
is
both
sweet
bitter
perfect
head
delicious
smell
of
sweet
hops
the
sweetness
bitterness
of
the
perfect
caliber
awesome
reason
art
of
the
bomber
bottle
label
great
for
an
at
home
cupples
nightcap
enjoyable
to
those
just
getting
into
ipas
of
strong
ales
i
prefer
more
of
the
bitter
ipas
or
doupleimperials
give
this
dogfish
head
brew
a
try
whenever
the
opportunity
enjoy
im
not
sure
whether
i
would
pick
up
this
brew
again
i
dont
want
to
say
it
wasnt
good
because
it
really
was
quite
good
but
any
store
that
stocks
this
is
bound
to
have
something
better
for
the
same
price
tag
purchase
value
b
bombers
are
typically
more
expensive
than
sixpacks
as
was
the
case
here
11
99
for
a
750
ml
bottle
is
about
average
for
a
90
rated
beer
but
it
felt
like
i
was
paying
for
the
artwork
and
tribute
nature
of
the
beer
rather
than
the
taste
another
exceptional
impressionable
craft
beer
from
dfh
ill
try
it
again
in
the
summer
at
soldier
field
well
the
bottle
art
is
obviously
fantastic
but
the
beer
is
pretty
damn
good
too
i
could
easily
drink
this
while
walking
down
shakedown
street
at
alpine
valley
looking
for
a
ganja
goo
ball
and
a
grilled
cheese
you
can
pick
up
some
of
the
honey
in
the
flavor
which
mingles
nicely
with
the
earthy
hops
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
the
body
of
this
brew
is
medium
and
really
smooth
easy
drinking
even
at
9
abv
glad
to
recommend
this
brew
cheers
the
label
states
that
this
is
an
imperial
pale
ale
brewed
with
almond
honey
granola
allamerican
hops
that
sums
this
up
much
better
than
be
listed
as
an
american
strong
ale
i
love
the
label
great
to
see
the
dancing
bear
with
a
mug
a
fine
tribute
and
overall
a
very
tasty
and
enjoyable
beer
that
hides
the
abv
and
is
quite
easy
to
drink
much
better
than
i
expected
jerry
would
be
proud
just
had
my
first
it
wont
be
my
last
didnt
think
i
was
gonna
like
this
one
but
it
really
surprised
me
i
will
always
grab
a
bottle
of
this
stuff
although
not
quite
what
i
expected
i
anticipated
a
bolder
malt
and
grain
character
the
beer
grows
on
you
with
its
varied
and
generally
complex
flavors
the
boozy
component
detracts
from
the
overall
appeal
its
somewhat
hot
and
astringent
still
one
may
find
this
another
intriguing
and
appealing
quirky
dfh
offering
thats
worth
the
experience
very
good
imperial
pale
ale
smooth
and
refreshing
had
from
tap
would
recommend
trying
alcohol
of
9
hidden
really
well
just
not
a
fan
thought
it
tasted
terriblen
especially
the
aftertaste
which
was
papery
not
really
sure
thin
and
just
smelled
kind
of
funky
somewhat
bitter
kind
of
foamy
so
the
pour
might
not
have
been
great
but
good
color
trying
again
when
i
can
this
is
what
it
says
it
is
it
tastes
like
an
amped
up
pale
ale
and
i
would
have
to
say
that
they
nailed
yet
i
would
much
rather
it
be
an
imperial
ipa
but
its
good
and
my
fellow
deadheads
asked
for
there
to
be
granola
in
it
so
i
guess
they
had
to
work
with
that
pours
a
rich
golden
color
with
a
thin
fizzy
head
that
trails
the
glass
the
smell
has
a
bit
of
toasted
malt
from
the
granola
as
well
as
a
decent
amount
of
citrus
from
the
hops
the
taste
was
very
bright
with
hops
being
the
focal
point
with
the
granola
coming
through
in
bits
and
pieces
very
well
balanced
and
hides
the
heavy
alcohol
content
well
would
definitely
try
again
o
good
nothing
phenomenal
however
a
bit
sweeter
than
i
like
my
dipas
to
be
too
heavy
overall
to
be
drinking
till
the
morning
comes
overall
not
real
impressive
an
interesting
idea
though
pours
a
three
finger
cream
head
that
fades
very
slowly
leaving
a
good
lace
crystal
clear
amber
color
good
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
grapefruit
hop
nose
and
flavor
follows

hints
of

thats

interesting
notes
with

but
didnt
quite
fall
into

for
me

not

on

adieu
d
a

american
strong

its
like
every
beer
youve
ever
drank
but
its
also
completely
unique
i
dont
have
a
single
complaint
also
while
i
have
no
superlatives
the
unique
dimensions
make
this
one
completely
memorable
i
would
drink
this
on
a
regular
basis
if
i
were
able
to
a
job
very
well
done
by
dfh
this
beer
is
excellent
it
is
strong
but
not
too
strong
it
has
a
very
pleasant
aroma
and
despite
its
high
alcohol
content
it
finishes
very
smooth
the
granola
which
was
the
ingredient
voted
in
by
deadheads
really
adds
a
nice
note
to
the
end
o
overall
it
drinks
well
i
dont
really
know
how
to
categorize
this
beer
and
bas
definition
fits
it
well
its
worth
a
try
o
a
delicious
creation
that
captures
the
spirit
of
those
crunchy
granola
tripsters
who
worship
the
dead
give
the
finish
some
time
to
settle
on
the
tongue
and
youll
swear
you
just
ate
a
clif
bar
judged
solely
as
a
beer
i
can
see
how
some
would
want
a
stronger
hops
profile
in
order
to
better
clean
the
sugars
but
doing
so
would
turn
this
into
an
iipa
and
would
drown
the
taste
the
recipe
has
successfully
achieved
because
of
that
i
recommend
tasting
this
alone
rather
than
attempting
to
pair
it
with
food
bottle
as
an
extra
from
trade
1012013
bottle
date
so
this
has
been
sitting
around
a
bit
but
i
dont
care
pours
deep
orange
colored
with
a
big
creamy
2inch
off
white
head
lots
of
lemon
peel
in
the
aroma
grass

orange
and
some
sweet

super
sweet
orangelemon
pinesol
flavor
is
a
bit
watered
down
with
some
sweet
orange
blossom
honey
and
orange
marmalade
flavor
in
the
background
just
under
medium
mouthfeel
low
to
medium
carbonation
slightly
slick
on
the
tongue
this
one
is
a
bit
funky
for
me
and
dont
really
get
any
granola
flavor
so
not
sure
what
that
added
here
not
a
big
fan
overall
really
had
a
soapy
floor
cleaner
characteristic
to
it
o
a
good
brew
id
definitely
would
drink
more
of
this
if
i
had
more
on
hand
i
like
the
band
i
will
have
to
admit
i
have
seen
them
a
few
times
over
the
years
and
the
offshoots
as
well
that
is
what
got
my
attention
in
regard
to
this
one
but
i
will
have
to
say
that
it
is
very
good
i
have
been
enjoying
ipas
lately
and
i
have
to
say
that
of
the
dogfish
head
beers
i
have
tried
over
the
years
i
do
think
they
make
a
damn
good
ipa
style
wise
over
some
of
the
other
offerings
although
this
could
also
be
me
anyway
i
thought
the
color
was
good
and
nothing
surprising
about
that
typical
of
the
style
it
did
have
some
head
that
settled
into
a
nice
lacing
after
a
few
minutes
the
smell
was
fruity
with
that
hoppy
pine
smell
i
love
but
there
was
a
sweetness
to
it
as
well
that
is
where
the
granola
enters
i
would
assume
it
does
have
that
cereal
grain
impact
to
it
that
kind
of
mellows
out
the
hoppy
bitterness
in
the
taste
the
taste
was
not
unlike
the
smell
i
detected
grapefruit
graininess
with
some
evergreeen
presence
it
had
a
sweetness
to
it
that
cuts
through
the
hops
and
makes
for
a
really
balanced
ipa
i
would
recommend
this
one
and
if
i
could
find
another
one
around
i
probably
would
pick
it
up
again
i
hope
this
is
something
dogfish
head
does
more
than
once
my
one
complaint
is
that
it
was
pricey
to
begin
with
and
that
seems
to
be
an
unfortunate
trend
overall
in
regard
to
good
beers
i
guess
we
will
just
have
to
get
used
to
it
okay
im
officially
tired
of
these
endlessly
silly
flavored
beerlike
brewing
experiments
from
dfh
i
dont
see
them
going
in
interesting
new
directions
it
just
seems
like
silliness
but
for
the
funloving
this
is
a
flavored
malt
liquor
with
a
story
and
hey
its
the
perfect
pour
for
your
morning
bowl
of
capn
crunch
from
the
750
ml
bottle
bought
at
bottleworks
in
seattle
poured
into
a
goblet
a
nice
medium
golden
amber
color
with
a
1
finger
white
head
plenty
of
carbonation
rose
from
the
bottom
to
keep
a
nice
thin
layer
on
top
aroma
was
slightly
sweet
malty
a
bit
of
hoppy
bitter
a
tad
of
grainy
bread
as
well
flavor
was
a
sweet
up
front
but
had
a
hit
of
tangy
hops
as
well
a
bit
of
floral
as
well
felt
good
in
the
mouth
coated
nicely
with
bit
of
tingle
overall
not
a
bad
beer
nothing
really
stood
out
from
the
granola
profile
but
it
didnt
hurt
it
either
beerandwhiskeyhq
overall
unusual
for
the
style
but
delivers
as
advertised
overall
interesting
but
not
great
hops
are
interesting
as
well
as
the
creamy
oat
feel
not
sure
if
i
like
how
the
ester
and
phenol
profile
come
through
with
the
booze
not
sure
what
yeast
they
used
but
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
it
at
least
in
this
style
although
it
would
probably
be
good
in
a
big
belgian
tripel
or
something
taste
is
herbal
resinous
hops
up
front
backed
by
a
round
malty
mouth
biscuit
in
the
back
it
has
a
nice
dry
finish
oak
and
char
notes
a
very
nice
ipa
not
many
citrus
notes
but
a
nice
earthy
resinous
flavor
simply
a
decent
ipa
o
though
it
wins
points
for
being
unique
but
what
dogfish
beer
doesnt
its
not
as
good
as
id
hoped
overall
its
fine
not
in
love
not
even
really
impressed
its
pretty
ok
dogfish
has
better
beers
at
better
prices
this
one
has
been
on
the
self
for
a
few
weeks
now
im
just
now
getting
around
to
trying
it
i
have
to
say
the
acid
bear
turned
me
off
i
finally
broke
down
and
pulled
the
trigger
this
one
pours
a
clear
golden
with
a
thick
head
the
smell
is
hoppy
with
a
good
mix
of
the
oats
from
the
granola
the
taste
is
hoppy
but
not
really
strong
its
mild
and
sweet
over
all
this
is
a
pretty
nice
beer
m
medium
bodied
well
carbonated
and
rather
drinkable
cheers
overall
this
was
a
nicely
crafted
beer
that
very
much
reminded
me
of
an
ommegang
ale
i
really
enjoyed
it
o
hoppy
grass
and
hot
a
big
pilsnerlike
pale
overall
a
slightly
hoppy
grainy
and
earthy
average
beer
does
not
rank
too
high
on
the
scale
of
dfh
beers
i
have
tried
nice
to
have
tried
but
i
think
i
will
pass
in
the
future
on
tap
at
dfh
rehoboth
i
have
to
say
this
is
probably
my
least
favorite
dfh
its
sweet
likebfruit
juice
but
a
bit
of
alcohol
burn
somewhat
thin
and
lifeless
i
really
wanted
to
like
this
one
but
just
didnt
work
for
me
best
label
ever
though
one
if
my
fav
bands
but
not
so
much
on
the
brew
o
was
expecting
more
somehow
disappointed
with
the
link
to
gd
but
o
k
drinking
wise
o
i
wonder
how
much
better
it
might
be
at
7
abv
it
fits
the
profile
of
a
9
0
sugar
bomb
for
me
anyway
good
yes
american
beauty
not
even
close
o
this
is
a
good
beer
its
nothing
extravagant
or
outrageous
its
just
a
simple
idea
and
very
well
executed
overall
a
real
mellow
dipa
even
though
its
not
classified
as
one
at
the
time
of
those
review
i
would
definitely
grab
it
just
to
have
it
but
its
definitely
no
90
minute
so
buyer
beware
salud
o
not
a
bad
brew
fro
dogfish
i
was
expecting
a
lot
more
but
this
was
flavorful
and
different
from
other
ipas
o
overall
initially
i
had
high
expectations
for
these
music
series
beers
especially
after
that
amazing
bitches
brew
but
then
i
was
brought
back
down
to
earth
with
the
next
few
and
have
come
to
expect
very
little
from
these
beers
other
than
a
hunt
to
obtain
them
the
good
news
this
one
is
actually
pretty
good
abv
is
well
hidden
and
the
flavors
are
pleasant
it
works
far
from
a
world
class
beer
but
good
enough
that
i
dont
mind
tackling
the
full
bottle
on
my
own
prost
750
ml
bottle
into
signature
tulip
glass
bottled
on

pours
fairly
crystal
clear
golden

to
a

lingers

a

a

expensive
at
12

a
bottle
in
my
area
but
at
9
abv
you
dont
need
more
than
a
bomber
it
was
a
nice
purchase
to
enjoy
for
thanksgiving
i
will
buy
regularly
90
minute
is
still
my
favorite
dfh
beer
but
this
is
good
and
can
be
gifted
to
all
your
deadhead
friends
that
appreciate
good
beer
overall
american
beauty
was
to
me
the
deads
best
studio
work
and
while
i
didnt
go
hunting
around
for
the
album
to
play
along
with
my
tasting
session
the
memories
certainly
bias
my
review
maybe
i
wouldnt
have
rated
it
this
high
without
the
connection
but
this
beer
was
certainly
worthy
of
a
dream
we
dreamed
one
afternoon
long
ago
d
this
was
a
fairly
plain
beer
with
simple
scent
and
taste
and
body
the
alcohol
was
hidden
ok
and
the
finish
was
pretty
smooth
so
it
was
easy
enough
to
drink
nothing
special
at
all
and
even
though
it
wasnt
bad
it
really
wasnt
worth
the
price
d
a
little
underwhelming
under
two
months
old
and
this
already
lost
a
lot
of
zing
not
getting
any
flaws
due
to
age
just
missing
a
step
i
am
a
fan
of
the
collaboration
brews
but
making
a
high
quality
beer
should
always
take
precedence
and
this
misses
the
mark
for
me
an
interesting
beer
it
really
does
smell
and
taste
like
granola
notes
of
cinnamon
almonds
some
sweetness
and
a
grainy
underpinning
thats
just
like
the
granola
graininess
overlaying
the
granola
is
a
firm
spicy
hoppiness
and
a
touch
of
sourness
from
the
grain
quite
pleasant
to
drink
overall
but
perhaps
a
bit
too
thick
in
body
from
the
granola
still
a
fun
take
on
the
band
and
a
beer
o
never
thought
id
have
a
beer
made
with
granola
but
damn
i
love
it
o
this
is
not
bold
in
any
way
it
is
good
and
pleasant
to
drink
once
again
dogfish
head
goes
bold
and
doesnt
disappoint
really
tasty
brew
shame
its
a
oneoff
run
this
is
a
very
good
and
wellbalanced
ale
tastes
fresh
and
flavorful
definitely
hoppy
but
has
some
notable
malt
in
there
to
even
it
out
decadent
body
a
bit
boozy
but
all
things
considered
pretty
tasty
and
worth
trying
o
alcohol
is
well
hidden
and
i
feel
this
is
truly
an
imperial
pale
ale
like
the
bottle
says
very
enjoyable
i
will
pick
this
up
again
overall
this
is
a
great
pale
ale
it
hides
the
alcohol
really
well
and
is
crushable
as
hell
no
way
id
guess
this
was
9
blind
dfh
has
been
throwing
me
for
a
loop
lately
with
all
the
stuff
theyve
been
coming
out
with
i
almost
feel
like
i
cant
keep
up
though
this
isnt
worth
nearly
20
a
bomber
that
doesnt
mean
the
beer
isnt
good
pours
a
really
big
head
but
its
mostly
air
the
larger
bubbles
pop
and
sizzle
down
rapidly
although
it
is
fun
to
watch
eggshell
white
to
light
tan
not
a
lot
of
stick
to
the
lacing
tends
to
slide
down
the
glass
sides
light
gauziness
to
the
coppery
orange
color
closer
to
a
reddish
brown
than
yellow
the
bubbles
are
few
but
they
are
fat
and
move
with
some
speed
the
nose
is
diffuse
and
easygoing
a
gregariously
sloppy
array
of
sweet
grains
orange
pulp
honey
hay
white
pepper
good
amount
of
apricot
to
peach
fruit
finishes
more
soft
and
estery
than
hoppy
slight
vinous
quality
in
the
mouth
its
mediumbodied
and
consistent
filling
cheek
to
cheek
not
soft
per
se
yet
not
biting
nor
unduly
bitter
the
honey
to
yogurt
aspects
lead
alongside
orange
and
grapefruit
citrus
again
the
apricot
peach
to
yellow
apple
fruit
plays
a
sizable
role
malty
and
the
granola
is
evident
with
each
sip
sweet
grains
give
it
an
even
consistency
start
to
finish
more
floral
through
the
finish
some
pine
sap
too
the
sweeter
side
of
hops
the
carbonation
is
on
the
creamy
side
and
helps
it
ooze
over
the
tongue
theres
nothing
you
can
say
it
nails
100
and
as
before
its
not
a
beer
of
pinpoint
precision
but
it
is
extremely
satisfying
and
something
to
just
kick
back
and
enjoy
o
this
is
amazing
very
very
happy
highly
recommended
kinda
sweet
for
an
ipa
but
still
this
beer
is
simply
too
sweet
for
me
i
agree
with
the
concept
of
imperial
pale
ale

i
think
this
is
another
solid
offering
from
dfh
in
their
musicbeer
lineup
the
beers
in
this
series
have
all
proven
to
be
pretty
fun
and
interesting
and
american
beauty
fits
in
there
nicely
hop
heads
and
others
who
are
only
after
a
hardcore
imperial
ipa
arent
going
to
be
fans
due
to
its
huge
malt
foundation
but
all
of
the
pieces
are
here
for
a
great
beer
regardless
of
what
its
labeled
id
happily
get
another
bottle
and
share
it
with
friends

american
beauty
is
an
inquisitive
ale
that
hasnt
been
all
that
dogfished
up
its
a
wellbuilt
beer
where
everything
comes
together
nicely
theres
really
no
debate
of
the
ales
friendly
and
approachable
taste
but
much
like
the
grateful
deads
music
i
find
the
beer
a
bit
banal
gasp
m
light
medium
bodied
edit
original
review
was
at
brewery
having
one
back
in
dc
on
tap
the
granola
is
more
noticeable
and
it
seems
more
woody
than
grassy
very
strong
and
fullbodied
with
a
nice
color
to
it
bright
amber
body
tight
foam
slathering
on
all
sides
flavor
starts
mild
with
oak
but
opens
up
to
alcohol
infused
caramel
and
mineral
hop
bitterness
very
easy
to
drink
with
the
stated
abv
12
oz
bottle
pour
is
mostly
copper
with
red
edges
and
a
fairly
tight
tan
head
nose
has
a
light
malt
base
with
hints
of
oak
and
a
fair
bit
of
green
apple
sweetness
acetaldehyde
as
i
am
to
understand
taste
has
a
bit
of
oxidation
notes
of
oak
and
some
boozy
characteristics
malt
base
is
fairly
rich
and
dry
a
touch
tart
and
definitely
a
bit
off
full
bodied
dry
finish
well
carbonated
i
recommend
aging
it
the
body
was
lighter
than
a
lot
of
other
comparable
brews
which
made
for
an
interesting
change
of
pace
drinkability
was
dangerously
good
a
bottle
or
3
could
get
down
the
throat
before
you
quite
realize
whats
going
on
overall
a
great
brew
one
that
compares
favorably
with
one
of
my
alltime
favorites
north
coast
old
stock
ale
this
would
certainly
be
in
regular
rotation
if
it
were
local
obviously
a
must
try
if
you
see
it
overall
its
an
interesting
beer
nice
malthoney
mix
with
the
bitter
hops
worth
a
try
if
you
find
it
and
its
not
too
much
super
kitty
has
a
nice
dark
looking
brown
bark
colored
look
with
some
dark
mahagony
popping
through
cant
really
see
through
the
beer
not
entirely
black
some
faint
bubbles
pop
up
and
pop
down
when
in
the
snifter
they
had
a
beige
tint
to
them
no
spots
on
the
glass
going
down
at
this
point
the
hops
have
all
but
faded
there
is
a
big
caramel
toffee
vibe
here
with
some
underlining
dark
fruit
mixture
brown
sugar
and
toasted
malt
super
kitty
kat
tastes
like
it
smells
rich
caramel
drk
fruit
chocolate
semi
vanilla
tones
toast
the
alcohol
pops
out
in
just
the
slightest
fashion
feel
is
a
step
down
from
full
bodied
with
a
small
amount
of
car
bubbles
on
the
tounge
swift
easy
drinking
while
not
being
overly
complex
even
at
6
years
old
a
great
beer
to
share
though
with
the
size
of
the
bottle
and
everything
be
careful
here
drinkability
goes
down
fairly
easily
a
bit
more
heft
to
the
mouthfeel
and
i
would
have
given
it
a
4
5
in
both
the
mouthfeel
and
the
overall
categories
o
it
was
very
good
i
dont
know
if
i
would
want
to
drink
this
a
lot
but
it
was
good
yup
pours
a
very
reddish
amber
color
with
a
one
and
a
half
finger
off
white
bubbly
head
sheets
of
lacing
on
down
the
my
allagash
chalice
faint
aroma
sweet
crystal
malts
sticky
hops
yes
honey
and
if
a
i
imagine
hard
enough
oak
too
an
aggressive
malty
and
hoppy
flavor
kind
of
a
piney
resinous
hop
flavor
presents
itself
very
sweet
yes
i
can
detect
honey
some
light
notes
of
vanilla
and
brown
sugar
too
as
the
beer
warms
some
of
that
oak
actually
shows
up
for
such
a
strong
beer
the
alcohol
is
super
well
hidden
pretty
rich
and
somewhat
cloying
i
typically
like
my
american
strong
ales
pretty
brash
and
oakymalty
and
this
falls
shy
the
brew
pours
a
mahogany
brown
and
is
capped
with
a
fizzy
root
beer
type
of
head
this
beer
sort
of
reminds
of
imperial
turbodog
it
is
a
bit
sweet
and
darkbready
with
molasses
and
uk
ale
yeast
fruitiness
there
is
also
a
bit
of
an
herbal
lemongrass
note
taking
hold
especially
on
the
finish
i
am
not
terribly
impressed
with
this
beer
i
had
never
heard
of
it
and
dont
know
what
the
big
deal
was
supposed
to
be
in
the
first
place
its
not
bad
but
its
not
particularly
good
either
d
not
sure
why
they
felt
the
need
to
put
this
in
1l
bottles
12oz
would
be
an
appropriate
bottle
size
the
2009
was
too
heavily
oaked
and
was
less
enjoyable
im
averaging
the
scores
of
both
vintages
for
the
most
part
here
o
overall
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
but
a
little
bit
of
a
disappointment
its
a
bit
bland
and
boozey
with
caramel
and
bready
malts
leading
the
way
would
give
it
another
not
but
wouldnt
seek
it
out
again
pours
an
amberbrown
color
with
some
dark
crimson
highlights
there
is
a
thin
head
but
it
fades
away
quickly
the
nose
has
a
bit
of
caramel
sweetness
and
molasses
light
hop
character
and
maybe
some
honey
really
quite
bland
and
boring
nothing
stands
out
and
the
notes
that
are
there
are
just
singular
and
dont
truly
interact
the
flavor
is
equally
disappointing
there
is
malt
sweetness
and
brown
sugar
plus
some
caramel
and
light
earthy
hops
maybe
a
touch
of
citrus
medium
body
with
some
booze
this
was
just
an
average
beer
which
was
quite
disappointing
after
i
had
sought
this
one
out
a
few
times
gfunk
o
overall
its
a
hop
heavy
ipa
aged
in
nice
tasting
oak
the
booze
is
there
making
the
mouth
really
nice
once
i
got
over
the
bittered
flavor
and
the
alc
warmed
me
a
bit
i
really
got
into
it
if
you
dig
oak
aged
brews
this
is
a
worthy
one
to
try
for
sure
since
the
wood
really
adds
a
great
touch
to
the
flavor
but
the
price
tag
is
a
bit
hefty
compared
to
other
limited
release
brews
that
are
out
there
one
for
the
tickers
for
sure
i
was
really
glad
to
see
it
on
tap
so
i
could
get
my
taste
without
having
to
shell
out
the
dough
for
a
bottle
cheers
o
out
standing
flavor
profile
with
a
much
better
balance
on
tap
this
was
a
great
brew
from
keegan
ales
my
first
from
them
i
believe
but
will
definitely
not
be
my
last
after
sipping
and
savoring
this
intense
offering
which
i
recommend
doing
this
is
not
one
to
pound
but
really
quaff
and
savor
over
a
period
of
time
highly
recommended
drinkability
not
too
boozy
but
it
does
hit
eventually
12
cant
be
hidden
for
too
long
still
this
is
a
delicious
brew
that
should
be
sipped
and
savored
and
enjoyed
at
least
once
i
wish
i
could
get
a
growler
d
this
is
a
beer
that
definitely
needs
to
be
sipped
given
its
high
alcohol
content
although
this
allows
you
to
savor
the
complex
taste

comes
in

is

tough
to
plow
through
even
a
glass
ps
american
strong

arent
exactly
my
favorite
style
of
beer
but
this
was
surely
enjoyable
all
in

this
is
phenomenal
i
am
so
glad
i
got
to
try
this
brew
standing
ovation
for

for
the

most
definitely
many
flavors
bounce
around
in
this
brew
and
it
seems
like
it
would
be
a
very
mass
appealing
brew
hop
heads
and
malt
monsters
will
enjoy
this
alike
even
wine
drinkers
would
appreciate
this
brew
all
around
great
beer
a
must
try
d
definitely
in
the
upper
reaches
of
the
strong
ale
category
at
least
as
far
as
abv
goes
the
label
says
12
and
you
can
definitely
taste
the
12
which
hindered
the
overall
drinkability
just
a
bit
otherwise
pretty
good
but
not
great
pours
a
coppery
orange
color
crisp
and
clear
with
a
decent
puff
of
stiff
foamy
white
head
big
whiffs
of
piney
floral
and
citrus
hops
with
a
sweet
big
malty
backbone
reminds
me
of
90
minute
from
dfh
taste
is
hoppy
and
bitter
with
a
very
interesting
balance
of
floral
piney
and
citrus
hops
and
a
sweet
toffee
and
carmel
like
malt
backbone
lighter
side
of
full

borders
on

very
dry
a
decent
beer
reminicent
of
dfhs
aggressive
ipas
medium
bodied
and
slightly
hoppier
than
the
aroma
suggests
still
a
lot
of
sweetness
and
heat
from
the

complimenting
the
sweet
caramel
malt
also
hints
of
graham
cracker
and
biscuit
along
with
sweet
citrus
and
dry
piney
hop
notes
long
dry
finish
with
more
alcohol
heat
and
warmth
overall
this
was
a
very
interesting
beer
and
i
cant
think
of
anywhere
else
it
belongs
but
in
the
american
strong
ale
category
well
worth
a
shot
the
more
i
drank
this
beer
the
more
i
enjoyed
it
and
as
it
warmed
it
got
tastier
there
seems
to
be
a
lot
going
on
with
apricot
and
possibly
some
raisin
as
well
as
some
more
hops
and
malt
in
the
finish
this
beer
almost
has
too
much
going
on
to
capture
all
of
the
tastes
and
once
the
alcohol
starts
kicking
it
its
very
hard
to
keep
a
handle
on
this
cornucopia
of
flavor
light
to
medium
carbonation
with
a
smooth
creamy
feel
on
the
tongue
and
in
the
mouth
this
beer
goes
down
way
too
easy
for
12
abv
well
done
keegans
this
beer
is
very
enjoyable
and
will
kick
your
ass
at
the
same
time
poured
into
a
sampling
glass
at
the
brewery
it
appeared
amber
with
less
than
a
finger
of
white
head
but
great
lacing
it
smelled
of
supersweet
pineapple
dates
and
caramel
and
the
taste
simply
confirmed
this
and
did
not
reveal
any
other
nuances
to
me
one
feature
of
the
flavor
that
was
positively
surprisingly
was
that
the
syrupy
sweetness
did
dissipate
fairly
quickly
after
the
finish
a
nice
twist
given
the
fact
that
most
strong
ales
and
barleywines
usually
leave
you
with
a
lingering
cloying
sweetness
also
the
alcohol
seemed
surprisingly
wellhidden
smooth
and
not
as
thick
as
i
had
expected
it
certainly
helps
this
intense
beers
sessionability
at
least
until
the
alcohol
knocks
you
on
your
rear
end
a
nice
beer
overall
but
i
wasnt
as
blown
away
as
i
had
been
expecting
to
be
given
all
of
the
stellar
reviews
i
had
read
d
i
love
this
beer
got
a
bottle
for
christmas
and
it
will
sit
in
the
cellar
for
a
long
while
glad
i
got
to
try
this
off
a
tap
one
of
the
most
overlooked
beers
that
i
have
ever
had
great
work
keegan
this
beer
strikes
me
as
the
bastard
child
of
hopslam
and
double
bastard
a
great
effort
from
a
brewery
that
really
hasnt
done
much
for
me
d
at
12
watch
out
you
know
the
alcohol
is
there
but
it
goes
down
way
too
easy
900
this
stuff
pours
from
my
16oz
growler
like
it
came
from
a
hand
engine
light
puffy
head
fading
to
a
light
film
and
ring
nice
lacing
for
a
twelve
percenter
clear
ruddy
amber
a
deep
caramel
and
butterscotch
maltiness
greets
my
nose
notes
of
oak
and
vanilla
light
piney
hops
and
a
bit
of
fusel
alcohol
a
soft
sweet
caramel
on
the
tongue
is
countered
by
a
healthy
grapefruit
and
leafy
hop
bittering
a
delicious
woodiness
flows
into
light
vanilla
alcohol
is
there
especially
in
the
finish
as
it
leaves
light
evaporative
vapors
it
is
so
well
integrated
that
it
never
calls
attention
to
itself
quite
a
feat
for
the
abv
feel
is
soft
and
silky
with
a
gentle
carbonation
super
drinkable
for
twelve
this
stuff
is
an
impressive
feat
for
the
brewer
the
overall
experience
is
a
cask
ale
in
a
growler
had
a
growler
of
this
64oz
for
new
years
2010
quite
fantastic
i
cannot
say
enough
good
things
about
this
beer
one
of
my
alltime
favorites
this
beer
pours
pretty
brownish
red
color
with
a
tan
head
that
recedes
to
a
nice
rocky
lace
sticking
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
really
awesome
the
roasted
malt
character
playing
nicely
with
the
really
pronounced
hop
presence
the
oak
is
noticeable
but
not
overwhelming
and
surprisingly
the
alcohol
isnt
even
detectable
the
flavor
follows
with
the
sweet
roasted
malt
up
front
complimented
nicely
by
the
vanilla
from
the
oak
and
balanced
perfectly
by
the
hops
the
heavy
body
and
good
co2
make
this
a
dangerously
drinkable
twelve
percent
the
beer
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
wonderful
pale
and
crystal
malt
scent
along
with
a
kick
ass
hop
aroma
the
oak
chips
provide
a
nice
vanilla
character
that
really
compliments
the
malthop
profile
the
taste
is
outstanding
it
has
a
very
complex
array
of
maltshopsand
oak
character
its
got
a
solid
malt
base
with
just
enough
crystal
malt
flavor
to
balance
the
enormous
hop
taste
the
oak
chips
really
bring
it
all
together
the
mouthfeel
is
perfect
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
damn
fine
beer
it
was
really
pricey
35
00bottle
but
it
was
worth
it
d
vastly
exceded
my
expectations
i
would
love
to
have
this
again
and
while
not
the
hype
machine
it
deserves
it
is
quite
a
treat
for
those
who
get
to
try
it
think
burton
baton
but
better
i
think
a
pint
or
two
would
suffice
but
i
could
also
see
this
one
as
being
a
beer
that
could
get
you
in
trouble

be

many
of
these

i

it
could
sneak
up
on
you
because
it
hides

abv
well
i
enjoyed
this
beer
in

past

even
more
so
this
year
i
have
a
3
year
vertical
of
bottles
in
my
basement
that
i
will
enjoy
reviewing
against
my
notes
for
this
overall
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
no
one
talks
about
but
then
you
open
up
the
bottle
and
are
simply
blown
away
what
a
fantastic
beer
its
so
good
i
went
through
a
whole
quart
of
it
myself
the
only
flaw
i
noticed
in
this
beer
is
that
it
could
have
been
a
little
more
viscous
if
keegan
could
somehow
fix
this
aspect
of
the
beer
super
kitty
would
be
a
top
30
beer
on
the
best
of
ba
easily
drinkability
is
off
the
charts
there
is
nonil
zero
nada
zilch
taste
of
alcohol
to
this
big
beer
which
is
extremely
dangerous
drinkability
it
was
very
good
i
dont
know
if
i
would
want
to
drink
this
a
lot
but
it
was
good
pours
a
rich
amber
with
a
creamy
tan
head
nose
has
candy
malts
dark
fruits
peppery
alcohol
honey
cloves
subtle
hops
vanilla
and
oak
taste
has
more
sweet
malts
oak
vanilla
honey
plums
figs
and
floral
hops
big
body
is
nicely
carbonated
tasty
american
strong
ale
drinkability
based
on
the
big
alcohol
in
this
one
it
is
truely
a
slow
sipper
overall
the
flavor
is
great
and
this
one
is
worth
picking
up
depsite
the
high
cost
grolsch
styled
top
allows
this
to
keep
over
a
session
and
it
stays
true
to
the
scent
with
the
addition
of
fruit
quite
hoppy
actually
very
strong
taste
so
its
more
of
a
take
it
easy
kind
of
beer
drinkability
the
punchy
but
never
glaring
considering
the
abv
alcohol
keeps
this
one
a
slow
sipper
but
an
enjoyable
one
after
a
bit
of
fussing
with
the
swingtop
to
break
the
wax
this
opens
with
a
hearty
fizz
pours
a
hazy
amber
with
a
thin
fingers
head
that
builds
and
dissipates
slowly
the
scent
is
great
honey
toasted
oat
charred
oak
caramel
a
little
bourbon
the
taste
is
wow
spiced
applepear
tart
with
a
nice
buttery
crust
topped
w
a
drizzle
of
honey
oak
vanilla
a
little
bourbon
burn
and
again
honey
hops
have
faded
slightly
but
are
still
present
lending
a
sweetly
floral
note
to
the
finish
that
complements
nicely
a
lot
going
on
here
even
at
lower
temps
not
sure
im
conveying
it
all
as
indicated
by
the
top
popping
this
still
has
a
fair
bit
of
carbonation
to
it
medium
body
but
not
at
all
syrupy
scarily
drinkable
for
the
strength
and
complexity
top
notch
and
the
first
wow
beer
ive
had
in
quite
a
while
actually
worth
the
sticker
price
nice
way
to
send
out
08
the
sweetness
and
booze
strength
hampers
the
drinkability
on
this
one
a
bit
but
by
the
rare
chance
that
you
have
to
possibility
to
try
this
do
its
a
very
original
brew
that
is
equaled
in
character
by
few
other
beers
that
ive
imbibed
thus
far
i
was
a
little
suprised
when
i
got
wrung
up
for
a
30
bottle
of
beer
but
having
opened
it
i
am
pleasantly
suprised
the
honey
and
oak
flavoring
adds
alot
to
the
hurricane
kitty
everything
seems
to
come
together
nicely
certainly
not
an
everyday
beer
but
a
nice
occasion
beer
seems
i
am
lucky
to
have
gotten
one
of
200
bottles
of
this
ale
i
will
pass
the
word
on
to
a
few
of
my
beer
loving
friends
taste
nice
smooth
medium
bodied
beer
oaky
honey
and
piney
hops
are
most
prevalant
alcohol
is
evident
but
not
overpowering
not
much
flavor
on
the
finish
though
but
i
really
prefer
a
beer
that
hangs
around
a
while
basically
you
have
to
continually
drink
to
really
appreciate
the
flavor
but
at
12
its
a
little
dangerous
not
entirely
sure
why
the
price
was
so
high
but
would
try
again
if
it
becomes
a
regular
more
reasonbly
priced
brew
just
hit
the
spot
while
i
was
cooking
salmon
smooth
and
complexvery
drinkable
with
a
surprisingly
strong
head
bridge
burner
is
a
flavorful
and
drinkable
strong
ale
ill
sure
have
another
o
a
wellcrafted
and
tasty
imperial
bpa
brown
pale
ale
pours
a
ruddy
mahogany
color
with
a
soapy
head
and
plenty
of
lace
aroma
is
fully
malty
and
has
just
a
kiss
if
smoke
reminds
me
of
the
smell
of
a
mild
aged
scotch
but
of
course
faintly
in
the
taste
malty
with
some
piney
resinous
hops
providing
expert
balance
toast
caramel
brown
sugar
and
hops
disguises
the
alcohol
very
well
full
bodied
with
a
soft
carbonation
wasnt
pouring
well
but
drank
just
fine
overall
this
is
a
smooth
american
strong
ale
can
hit
with
the
best
of
them
mellow
spice
in
the
hops
with
much
attention
devoted
to
a
burnt
sugar
caramel
semifruity
malt
earthiness
builds
in
the
middle
with
more
hop
flavor
than
bitterness
and
enough
of
it
to
go
around
a
little
bit
more
of
that
chocolate
is
going
a
long
way
more
than
smacked
by
a
blanket
of
kilned
barley
malt
and
dark
fruit
nuances
pleasant
with
a
subtle
sweetness
that
i
adore
booze
is
not
headrearing
but
steady
and
somber
its
a
great
drink
for
almost
9
carbonation
is
onkey
and
the
body
is
buttery
and
filledout
to
great
effect
premium
mouthfeel
for
an
imperial
amber
no
points
docked
for
style
either
would
order
this
over
most
strong
ales
and
barleywines
that
meet
near
the
middle
of
the
venn
diagram
awesome
overall
its
a
shame
i
paid
so
much
i
do
have
vintage
estate
which
would
probably
charge
around
2
bucks
for
this
i
would
easily
pay
12
dollars
a
six
pack
no
questions
asked
surprisingly
really
good
not
normally
a
lake
front
fan
nice
grapefruit
aroma
with
a
bit
of
pine
deep
russet
hue
medium
bodied
a
little
slick
bright
back
end
hop
character
with
enough
sweet
caramel
malt
to
balance
almost
bitter
sweet
some
dried
fruit
notes
a
nice
little
find
bitterness
is
clean
and
refreshing
alcohol
is
well
hidden
flavors
are
well
blended
and
concise
this
is
a
strong
strong
ale
booze
is
certainly
forward
by
the
name
and
style
though
its
to
be
expected
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
a
strong
sipper
this
is
a
solid
choice
this
one
is
smooth
with
a
hop
malt
balance
smooth
means
silky
in
the
mouthfeel
the
flavors
are
well
blended
it
poured
well
and
it
made
a
pretty
carbonated
greeting
its
balanced
but
not
idiosyncratic
i
want
to
rave
but
its
just
good
overall
this
is
a
solid
beer
and
its
definitely
worth
a
try
if
you
like
smooth
malty
brews
i
dont
know
that
id
pick
it
up
again
but
im
not
disappointed
in
it
either
overall
not
my
favorite
style
but
perhaps
my
favorite
beer
of
this
style
very
flavorful
and
smooth
overall
this
is
a
good
strong
ale
very
clean
and
tasty
flavor
might
not
be
the
most
complex
thing
ever
but
its
drinkable
and
delicious
overall
i
like
this
its
got
a
good
level
of
complexity
but
nothing
out
of
control
great
balance
of
toasted
malt
hops
and
sweetness
overall
a
good
sessionable
ale
if
yourre
looking
to
get
loopy
fast
if
not
particularly
special
or
memorable
overall
i
believe
this
would
be
a
better
beer
if
the
booze
was
dialed
down
surprising
at
8
5
the
alcohol
was
so
prevalent
as
the
beer
came
to
room
temperature
is
was
much
more
enjoyable
od
decent
strong
ale
tame
in
the
hop
department
but
tasty
enough
not
breaking
new
ground
at
all
but
tasty
enough
this
is
a
rich
tasting
brew
but
too
much
taste
from
the
alcohol
i
enjoyed
the
balance
of
malt
and
hops
i
wished
that
i
had
cellared
this
one
to
mellow
the
alcohol
and
intentsifed
the
tasted
i
think
the
potential
is
there
now
why
would
you
wanna
go
and
burn
your
bridges
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
topaz
topped
by
a
finger
of
light
khaki
foam
the
nose
comprises
mild
caramel
mixed
greens
and
very
light
maple
syrup
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
eliciting
a
flavor
of
syrupcovered
greens
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
fluid
feel
overall
a
decent
brew
though
nothing
to
really
get
excited
over
o
an
average
tasting
brew
seemed
more
like
a
strong
amber
than
strong
ale
nothing
to
write
home
about
every
aspect
of
this
one
is
just
too
blunt
to
me
one
harsh
note
after
another
but
nothing
really
hangs
together
sorry
but
not
to
my
taste
drinking
bridge
burner
you
get
the
impression
that
with
this
offering
the
brewery
really
wanted
to
impress
being
able
to
discern
where
the
hops
end
and
the
malts
start
is
a
task
both
herculean
and
arcane
like
knowing
all
the
constellations
or
differentiating
between
subspecies
of
moths
what
does
it
matter
this
has
plenty
of
both
and
thats
all
you
need
know
overall
an
enjoyable
strong
ale
by
lakefront
i
like
the
stronger
malt
backbone
with
the
hops
playing
the
supporting
role
nice
to
find
other
american
craft
offerings
in
calgary
a
bottle
into
a
tulip
the
bridge
burner
is
dark

witha
thick

the
aroma
is

little
fresh
pine
molasses
sweet
dark
sugar
and
slightly
like
sweet
fruit
punch
think
about
it
its
there
on
the
palate
a
little
more
roasted
barley
character
is
present
with
a
good
hit
of
lemon
and
a
balanced
bitterness
not
a
lot
of
heat
though
the
alcohol
heat
is
present
and
overall
a
fairly
rich
creamy
body
little
lingering
taste
of
chocolate
malt
and
brown
sugar
american
strong
ales
are
always
such
a
mixed
bag
this
one
comes
close
to
being
the
american
ale
equivalent
of
a
belgian
dubbel
very
much
worth
a
try
bottle
poured
a
dark

a
large

and
some
light

of
dry
roasted
malt
with
some
resin

taste
is
a
mix
between
some
roasted

notes
with
dry
notes
and
some
pine

citrus
hops
punch
body
is
quite
full
with
somewhat
of
a
creamy

with
no
apparent

well

punch
deep
opaque
burgundy
khaki

and
a
good
bit
of

strong

there
too
and
have
some

and
spice
to
them
more

alcohol
toffee
dark

and
a
bit
of

some

in
the
finish

some

lingers
some
sweetness
and
alcohol
on
the
back
end
medium
full

interesting
and
saw
faint
comparisons
to
arrogant

can
be
drawn
m
medium
body
creamy
with
some
nice
sticky
hop
oils
light
to
moderate

this
is
a
bit
of
a
mess
of
a
beer
a
nice
mess
but
hard
to
pick
apart
complex
malt
backbone
duking
it
out
with
brash
hops
i
really
like
this
one
fun
to
explore
o
a
delicious
brew
full
of
flavour
and
well
worth
seeking
out
easy
drinking
and
an
abv
that
is
incredibly
well
hidden
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
brew
and
will
be
grabbing
a
few
extra
bottles
before
they
disappear
a
very
flavorful
and
drinkable
strong
ale
really
liked
this
one

lightish

pretty

at

also
this
was
pretty
solid
lots
going
on
here
in
terms
of
flavour
more
body
and
softer
carbonation
would
have
gone
a
long
way
here
but
still
a
very
drinkable
beer
overall
lots
of
flavours
going
on
here
i
dont
really
like
the
strawberryguava
type
fruitiness
in
there
but
the
rest
of
it
works
well
i
picked
up
a
few
bottles
thinking
i
could
age
them
but
im
not
sure
that
will
work
out
well
for
the
price
under
6
its
a
solid
brew
i
will
come
back
to
while
its
here
nice
hoppy
ale
have
read
others
describing
this
as
a
messy
beer
and
i
think
thats
a
good
description
but
its
a
messiness
im
really
enjoying
may
be
time
to
book
a
trip
to
milwaukee
light
to
medium
body
medium
carbonation
with
a
sticky
finish
overall
some
nice
aspects
but
the
body
does
not
work
and
the
flavours
are
a
bit
out
of
balance
o
a
pretty
good
offering
from
lfb
but
it
leaves
me
wanting
more
from
it
a
bit
more
assertive
and
not
so
safe
in
the
hopmalt
combination
lfb
doesnt
seem
to
take
too
many
risks
which
may
be
a
good
thing
an
easy
drinker
for
an
8
beer
this
was
nicely
done
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
i
like
what
milwaukee
put
together
in
this
one
o
this
was
a
nice
strong
ale
nothing
amazing
that
really
stood
out
but
an
easy
to
drink
enjoyable
strong
ale
that
i
could
easily
have
again
id
definitely
recommend
checking
it
out
if
you
get
the
chance
light
bodied
with
a
sharp
edgy
beginning
this
brew
agrees
with
me
but
my
thought
here
is
that
is
that
it
doesnt
quite
have
the
base
to
really
age
well
in
the
cellar
this
is
evident
by
the
lack
of
smooth
transitions
from
one
flavor
to
another
d
very
drinkable
nice
balanced
american
strong
ale
with
a
good
malty
backbone
and
a
nice
hop
profile
d
not
bad
better
than
i
expected
in
fact
especially
after
seeing
the
copious
amounts
of
floaters
that
ended
up
in
the
glass
the
malt
character
was
relatively
complex
and
well
balanced
with
and
it
is
pretty
drinkable
for
the
alcoholic
strength
overall
nicely
complex
certainly
better
than
i
was
expecting
definitely
worth
trying
o
while
a
very
broad
spectrum
bridge
burner
seems
to
embody
an
american
strong
ale
well
great
caramel
malt
base
with
sweetness
and
strong
american
hoppiness
for
bold
assertive
flavor
and
character
the
body
seems
a
little
weak
for
how
potent
the
beer
ends
up
being
in
the
long
run
but
a
bomber
of
this
will
certainly
get
your
fist
in
the
air
to
viva

revolucion
o
a
balanced
drinker
for
its
weight
nicely
done
taste
is
very
roasted
malt
notes
of
chocolate
bitterness
and
sweetness
round
out
the
taste
this
is
very
easy
and
pleasant
to
drink
mouth
feel
is
pretty
heavy
but
acceptable
for
the
type
of
beer
this
is
very
worthy
mouthfeel
was
sweet
and
a
little
bit
funky
really
enjoyed

with
some
boozy
warmth
big
beer
save
this
one
for
dessert
or
when
the
weather
is
cooler
weather
strong
bodied
with
lots
of
fruit
plums
in
particular
it
had
been
sitting
in
the
beer
fridge
for
about
four
months
so
it
may
have
lost
any
hop
characteristics
as
there
were
very
little
to
be
found
a
pleasant
drink
nonetheless
think
a
tawny
port
but
with
less
than
half
the
abv
less
sweet
and
darker
fluffy
head
and
an
aroma
that
matches
its
flavor
medium
high
carbonation
make
this
one
fun
drink
if
this
beer
is
what
an
american
strong
ale
is
then
i
am
in
i
have
to
sit
and
think
about
what
i
am
drinking
since
the
profile
is
so
varied
brilliant
what
an
experience
different
probably
will
be
a
favorite
o
delicious
beer
that
is
fairly
ambiguous
but
regardless
it
is
quite
tasty
tastes
a
little
similar
to
a
very
good
scottish
ale
the
more
i
think
about
it
the
more
i
realized
i
liked
it
a
lot
would
like
more
of
this
but
havent
seen
it
around
here
picked
it
up
at
johns
market
in
portland
salud
d
not
a
session
brew
but
excellent
i
love
lakefront
brewery
especially
their
tour
but
this
one
in
bomber
format
and
pricing
isnt
something
i
see
myself
returning
too
nice
to
score
something
from
milwaukee
at
bens
in
reno
though
pours

that
doesnt
last
for
long
aroma
is
a
nice
piney
hop
over
big
caramel
malts
and
dark
fruits
taste
kinda
reminds
me
of
a
less
alcoholic
barleywine
with
a
bit
more
hoppiness
than
is
normal
for
the
style
the
mouthfeel
is
full
and
the
drinkability
is
good
overall
a
solid
strong
ale
for
a
solid
price
o
this
could
use
some
time
to
mellow
out
a
bit
too
sweet
and
boozy
if
it
looks
like
smells
like
and
tastes
like
a
dipa
then
it
must
be
so
no
two
out
of
three
for
the
win
ah
well
its
got
more
bigass
hopitude
packed
into
those
45
ibus
than
a
lot
of
actual
dipas
ive
recently
come
across
tasty
american
strong
and
ale
got
it
o
similar
to
an
esb
damn
good
mouthfeel
a
strong
burn
out
of
this
strong
ale
which
is
a
pleasure
to
drink
the
sticky
carbonation
left
my
mouth
with
a
light
roasted
feeling
which
i
enjoyed
overall
not
sure
if
i
got
a
bad
bottle
or
what
i
see
lots
of
good
reviews
from
reviewers
i
respect
but
this
ones
not
happenin
slainte
great
dark
color
awesome
tan
head
that
sticks
to
the
glass
fruity
hoppy
nose
really
makes
me
think
im
going
to
enjoy
this
fruity
sweet
not
as
hoppy
as
promised
by
the
label
and
the
smell
still
tasty
very
slight
alcohol
back
to
let
you
know
its
8
mouthfeel
is
thin
smooth
could
easily
drink
a
couple
of
these
though
i
think
id
be
over
the
sweetness
at
some
point
overall
enjoyable
beer
got
this
in
a
4
bomber
sampler
pack
looking
forward
to
trying
the
others
d
insanely
drinkable
though
i
wanted
it
to
be
this
or
that
as
i
drank
it
at
the
end
of
the
day
this
is
a
really
drinkable
beer
that
hides
its
alcohol
and
inspires
one
to
drink
it
down
and
then
look
for
more
o
amazing
nose
a
little
too
hot
a
little
too
thin
still
delicious
and
complex
average
strong
a
bit
like
a
malt
liquor
with
some
chocolate
flavouring
not
so
drinkable
would
like
some
more
hops
which
would
be
more
like
the
style
o
overall
bridge
burner
is
a
solid
beer
that
is
worth
a
try
just
about
full
bodied
it
shows
relatively
well
balanced
notes
of
malty
caramel
grains
but
still
heavier
on
the
bitter
hoppiness
grassy
and
fruity
quite
nice
better
than
expected
for
whatever
reason
coincidence
or
not
their
large
bottlesbombers
bring
better
beers
than
the
small
ones
m
smooth
deceiving
given
the
high
abv
i
could
get
in
trouble
with
this
one
creamy
and
friendly
with
just
a
hint
of
the
alcohol
cheers
d
a
very
well
crafted
beer
by
lakefront
im
proud
of
this
wisconsin
brewery
and
this
is
a
brew
i
would
recommend
to
anybody
that
appreciates
good
craft
beer
drink
this
was
a
beer
i
saw
and
hey
its
probably
a
rare
find
out
of
state
and
didnt
tell
anyone
then
went
to
my
total
wine
in
brea
and
they
had
and
went
fk
oh
well
still
tasty
bb
is
far
too
light
in
body
to
compete
objectively
with
arrogant
bastard
and
the
rest
but
it
could
easily
carve
a
niche
into
the
drinking
repertoire
of
someone
who
enjoys
a
stronger
more
assertive
brew
without
sacrificing
drinkability
give
this
a
shot
thanks
to
ratman
i
think
for
sharing
a
bottle
of
this
one
with
us
a
while
back
poured
a
hazy
rusty
amber
color
with
a
smallish
tan
head
aromas
of
caramel
toffee
milk
chocolate
and
toasted
malt
on
the
palate
this
one
was
medium
bodied
with
flavors
of
caramel
light
hops
toasted
malt
and
chocolate
medium
bodied
with
a
balance
of
bitter
earthy
hops
sweet
citrus
notes
and
roasted
malt
dry
and
bitter
up
front
with
hints
of
grass
and
pine
but
this
is
quickly
countered
by
the
fruit
notes
and
sweet
malt
character
hints
of
grapefruit
and
orange
peel
along
with
some
other
light
fruit
notes
followed
by
some
caramel
toffee
chocolate
and
hazelnut
slightly
roasty
but
not
enough
to
overshadow
the
other
notes
complex
with
a
well
masked
abv
resulting
in
a
pretty
quaffable
beer
o
i
enjoyed
this
very
much
i
am
wondering
whether
this
is
a
dark
dipa
with
all
its
hoppy
goodness
whatever
it
is
i
like
it
and
look
forward
to
more
well
done
lakefront
i
can
tell
this
had
a
decent
abv
on
it
usually
when
i
can
detect
it
it
tends
to
ruin
it
not
in
this
case
a
nice
looking
tasty
brew
im
certainly
going
to
try
this
again
in
the
near
future
getting
some
more
of
these
for
that
price
overall
a
great
beer
i
liked
it
quite
a
bit
and
would
definitely
have
it
again
d
considering
the
abv
and
that
might
be
coming
through
a
little
in
the
taste
this
beer
isnt
bad
but
its
not
great
d
this
is
a
nice
surprise
from
lake
front
nice
work
guys
the
mouthfeel
has
a
dense
body
with
a
smooth
texture
this
is
filling
in
a
good
way
i
want
to
call
this
a
barleywine
it
has
all
the
flavor
and
body
but
the
abv
is
a
little
on
the
low
side
for
a
barleywine
i
guess
you
could
say
it
stands
in
the
middle
of
the
bridge
between
a
strong
ale
and
a
barleywine
overall
an
enjoyable
beer
probably
not
one
of
my
first
choices
when
buying
but
definitely
worth
a
go
every
once
in
awhile
this
hit
the
spot
i
would
call
it
a
solid
beer
tasted
fresh
and
right
i
would
go
for
it
again
if
i
wanted
that
ipahop
bite
on
top
of
a
slightly
deeper
richer
malt
base
good
stuff
pours
a
fairlydark
brown
color
with
a
thin
light
tan
head
with
pretty
good
retention
the
nose
yields
a
bit
of
strong
malt
sweetness
along
with
some
dark
fruits
theres
a
bit
of
light
cherry
lingering
in
the
background
as
well
mild
brown
sugar
the
flavor
is
fruity
and
sweet
not
too
much
complexity
but
a
nice
combination
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
a
bit
of
booze
overall
pretty
good
i
wouldnt
mind
tried
this
aged
out
a
bit
further
overall
this
is
an
awesome
brew
according
to
the
owner
this
beer
was
a
seasonal
but
it
has
become
so
popular
they
are
going
to
make
it
year
round
d
very
nice
probably
the
best
lakefront
beer
i
have
had
so
far
couldnt
have
more
than
1
bomber
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
worth
seeking
out
and
trying
m
d
starts
a
bit
sweet
finishes
dry
easy
to
drink
good
overall
drinkabilitysmooth
and
flavorful
with
some
heat
of
alcohol
overall
quite
pleasant
would
love
to
try
a
fresher
bottle
just
to
see
what
the
diff
is
im
guessing
more
hops
but
also
a
bit
hotter
boozewise
overall
a
really
good
beer
but
i
would
probably
reach
past
it
on
the
shelf
to
grab
another
beer
if
i
saw
it
again
it
just
didnt
have
the
taste
to
push
it
over
the
top
for
me
another
solid
limited
release
form
lakefront
muddled
my
way
through
the
glass
not
a
good
beer
d
for
drinkability
we
have
a
fulfilling
red
that
sits
high
on
the
side
of
flavor
with
an
ample
bitternessand
body
with
a
dry
well
being
great
downer
and
very
good
example

styleagain
drinks
like
a
red
no
hesitation
for
repeat
and
six
pack
purchase
a
good
strong
ale
at
an
excellent
price
tag
well
done
lakefront
i
really
couldnt
tell
from
the
label
what
kind
of
beer
this
is
unless
i
missed
it
but
after
tasting
it
its
definitely
a
strong
ale
pours
deep
dark
mahogany
clear
with
creamy
tan
head
and
great
retention
and
massive
lacing
smell
was
of
malt
caramel
and
a
sweetness
perhaps
a
slight
hops
but
i
didnt
notice
much
this
beer
definitely
is
great
if
youre
a
malt
lover
the
taste
was
sweet
and
malty
more
of
a
roasted
malt
some
sweet
ripe
fruit
and
a
caramel
kick
to
it
as
well
i
personally
hardly
noticed
the
hops
maybe
the
first
few
sips
but
eventually
the
malt
took
over
mouthfeel
was
fuller
but
not
too
thick
very
smooth
and
it
leaves
a
nice
slick
feeling
overall
a
great
beer
no
complaints
really
and
the
abv
is
very
well
hid
i
just
wish
the
hops
stood
out
a
little
more
the
hops
in
this
are
reminiscent
of
a
westcoast
namely
lagunitas
profile
fat
tire
crossed
with
hairy
eyeball
maybe
maybe
leaning
toward
an
arrogant
bastard
but
even
more
enjoyable
than
that
one
has
become
not
sure
but
for
5
i
recall
this
was
a
great
buy
and
would
be
a
nice
staple
in
the
market
out
here
i
liked
it
d
drinkable
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
nice
aroma
interesting
flavor
kind
of
a
beer
that
falls
between
a
couple
different
styles
i
guess
that
is
why
it
is
placed
in
the
strong
ale
category
this
beer
was
a
cola
colored
brown
with
a
cream
colored
head
the
smell
was
malty
sweet
some
brown
sugar
the
taste
was
sweet
and
malty
toffee
tones
and
maybe
a
spice
undertone
the
mouthfeel
was
warming
with
a
medium
body
this
beer
was
enjoyable
nice
tasty
beer
big
bold
and
drinkable
this
one
grew
on
us
real
fast
nothing
over
the
top
but
loads
of
flavor
packed
into
this
beer
balanced
and
a
joy
to
drink
which
makes
this
a
little
dangerous
at
8percent
abv
i
havent
had
many
lakefront
beerthe
ones
i
have
had
have
been
sorta
pedestrian
poured
a
medium
shade
of
brown
with
a
decent
sized
white
head
atop
that
left
broken
lace
as
it
settled
in
my
impy
nonic
aromas
are
greata
mix
of
big
caramel
malt
and
pinecitrus
hopsits
american
strong
ale
thru
and
thru
in
my
mind
flavors
start
out
greata
smack
of
resiny
hop
mixed
with
some
caramel
and
brown
sugarthe
finish
though
is
abrupt
and
lacking
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
and
takes
away
from
the
flavors
in
my
opinion
its
pretty
good
but
could
be
greatglad
i
tried
it
being
from
milwaukee
and
having
tasted
many
of
lakefronts
beers
i
was
looking
forward
to
trying
the
bridge
burner
since
i
enjoy
many
of
their
other
styles
poured
into
snifter
glass
appearance
was
a
nice
amber
color
with
generous
white
head
appearance
however
is
where
the
enjoyment
ended
for
me
smell
was
a
very
sharp
earthiness
of
dry
grass
leaves
and
twigs
not
a
memorable
scent
i
could
taste
a
little
bit
of
caramel
but
it
was
over
shadowed
by
such
a
sharp
hoppy
bitterness
and
overburnt
taste
that
i
wasnt
able
to
enjoy
it
maybe
its
the
strong
ale
style
that
i
am
just
not
a
fan
of
but
i
just
had
trouble
getting
much
enjoyment
out
of
it
the
mouthfeel
had
dry
citruslemon
with
a
hint
of
pine
but
nothing
memorable
i
tasted
way
too
much
alcohol
for
my
liking
and
not
enough
balance
with
the
caramel
and
other
fruitearth
flavors
maybe
it
was
too
much
carbonation
i
dont
know
but
to
me
it
lacked
balance
i
wasnt
able
to
finish
the
22oz
bottle
which
is
rare
i
am
by
no
means
a
american
strong
ale
expert
but
it
was
something
i
will
not
be
trying
again
im
going
to
try
some
other
asas
and
see
if
its
just
the
style
im
not
a
fan
of
vs
this
particular
beer
sticky
and
full
bodied
a
fairly
big
beer
that
seems
like
an
imperial
amber
a
la
nugget
nectar
sweet
sticky
specialty
malt
resinous
hop
bitterness
piney
and
fruity
notes
not
too
heavy
but
still
a
sipper
medium
to
low
carbonation
smooth
feel
to
it
pretty
substantial
hop
character
thats
well
integrated
overall
will
pick
this
up
again
drinkability
is
good
but
the
might
be
a
little
too
sweet
for
me
to
drink
an
entire
bomber
d
a
solid
to
great
beer
with
just
an
overall
good
taste
and
feel
refreshing
yet
a
tad
rich
fitting
for
the
fall
time
too
an
overall
good
beer
for
anytime
of
the
year
a
far
better
drinkable
beer
in
a
style
that
i
typically
find
is
not
well
done
lakefront
drinkability
if
you
are
in
the
mood
for
a
malt
heavy
beer
this
is
it
but
it
comes
across
a
bit
to
sweet
for
my
liking
in
a
strong
ale
this
brew
pour
brilliantly
clear
deep
mahogany
with
a
deep
ruby
hue
and
a
thick
sticky
tan
head
the
aroma
is
moderatehigh

and
piney
hop
and
a
mediumlow

in

background
the
flavor
is
quite
complex
mediumhigh
hop
flavor
pine
citrus
and
floral
with
moderate

beneath
the
hops
there
is

backbone
malty
caramel
a
bit
of
burnt
sugar
and
a
hint
of
smoke
carbonation
is
medium
and
body
full
overall
a
hoppy
amber
ale
that
is
complex
and
hides
its
8
abv
remarkably
well
picked
this
up
by
random
accident
label
caught
my
eye
and
picked
up
a
sampler
pack
before
and
was
pleased
deep
deep
amber
pour
with
a
big
billowy
head
big
malts
dominate
this
beer
didnt
get
that
much
hop
balance
but
not
a
problem
boozy
undertones
remind
you
of
the
8
overall
very
good
beer
and
glad
i
stumbled
on
it
its
easy
to
drink
and
ill
finish
the
bomber
but
i
wouldnt
recommend
picking
this
one
up
at
this
point
in
the
game
it
hasnt
aged
terribly
well
d
bridge
burner
is
a
pretty
good
um
i
guess
a
strong
ale
since
there
was
nothing
on
the
label
indicating
the
style
i
assumed
hoppy
amber
whatever
it
is
its
a
pretty
solid
tasty
brew
with
a
nice
mouthfeel
i
enjoyed
this
wellbalanced
american
strong
ale
from
lakefront
easily
my
favorite
from
the
brewery
d
with
more
balance
this
beer
goes
down
really
smooth
as
such
it
takes
a
little
more
effort
but
im
certainly
not
choking
it
down
overall
its
a
pretty
solid
offering
murky
looking
crimson
brown
body
thin
and
bubbly
beige
head
lace
etches
my
glass
in
nicely
spaced
rings
aroma
is
piney
and
sprucy
and
brings
out
a
spiked
punch
aspect
to
it
as
well
which
i
like
in
strong
and
old
ales
ill
tell
you
what
this
beer
has
got
some
character
best
beer
ive
had
in
a
while
from
lakefront
its
actually
pretty
subtle
but
complex
the
pine
and
spruce
are
subtle
and
not
overbearing
in
the
least
and
mix
nicely
with
the
tropical
fruit
tones
and
underlying
toffeenougat
malt
base
alcohol
is
detectable
but
only
in
trace
amounts
which
aint
too
bad
for
an
8
beer
body
is
hitting
lightmedium
at
best
and
the
carbonation
is
quite
reserved
very
enjoyable
beverage
d
a
high
abv
that
is
somewhat
noticeable
when
it
warms
makes
this
a
one
bomber
and
done
beer
a
good
winter
beer
and
one
that
i
think
would
age
well
every
time
i
lift
my
glass
to
drink
the
smell
says
ipa
and
the
taste
says
something
completely
different
im
editing
as
of
051810
the
booziness
has
definitely
calmed
and
the
hops
flavor
is
still
here
the
taste
is
similar
maltysyrupy
up
front
with
caramelised
orange
peel
candied
orange
dark
rummy
raisin
syrup
for
turks
out
there
a
bit
like
rum
mixed
with
pekmez
its
quite
sweet
almost
cloying
from
the
start
but
the
sweetness
does
not
get
worse
thankfully
and
the
character
plus
light
hoppy
bitterness
and
the
warm
alcoholic
spiciness
moderate
this
a
bit
however
it
is
still
almost
cloying
its
a
bit
rough
very
thick
and
oily
and
rather
onedimensional
the
character
strong
and
bold
but
lacking
depth
or
complexity
the
oiliness
gets
worse
and
becomes
too
slick
and
thick
as
it
warms
and
a
rough
meatiness
soon
develops
it
is
somewhat
enjoyable
but
only
in
small
amounts
and
its
very
heavy
drinkability
as
others
have
pointed
out
very
similar
to
arrogant
bastard
which
is
not
among
my
favorites
just
too
sticky
for
my
palate
this
to
me
seems
like
a
bit
of
a
barleywine
with
the
volume
turned
down
its
still
good
though
and
would
be
even
better
fresh
recommended
a
rather
intriguing
offering
from
the
klisch
brothers
after
reading
the
interesting
label
i
pour
a
generous
amount
of
beer
from
my
bomber
into
a
lakefront
pint
glass
whoa
a
slightly
aggressive
pour
results
in
a
solid
two
inches
of
thick
beige
head
that
would
make
a
rootbeer
proud
after
it
settles
the
amount
of
sticky
lace
on
my
glass
is
just
as
impressive
the
aroma
is
spicy
malt
and
hops
sort
of
peppery
with
a
sweet
fruit
hint
the
flavor
is
rich
malt
and
bitter
hop
the
flavor
is
spicy
as
well
caramelsweet
fruitpepperchocolate
even
a
hint
of
coffee
the
alcohol
come
through
on
the
finish
lots
goin
on
here
very
flavorful
and
robust
medium
to
full
body
plenty
of
carbonation
this
is
probably
the
most
flamboyant
beers
ive
ever
had
from
lakefront
this
is
a
good
thing
im
sure
i
will
run
into
this
beer
around
town
lucky
for
me
lakefront
is
a
better
brewery
than
my
memory
gives
them
credit
for
holiday
spice
lager
riverwest
stein
beer
ipa
cream
city
pale
ale
and
white
beer
are
all
solid
this
one
is
as
well
next
time
ill
drink
it
fresh
and
hoppy
bottom
line
bridge
burner
is
a
barn
burner
of
an
american
strong
ale
aroma
of
a
stronge
pale
ale
lots
of
spicy
hop
mixed
with
a
good
malt
presence
same
with
the
quaff
with
bits
of
doughy
wood
resin
mixed
in
for
good
measure
nothing
strong
ale
about
this
one
its
a
hop
bomber
but
a
darn
tasty
one
8
is
well
hidden
id
have
no
problem
recommending
this
one
to
try
glad
i
got
the
chance
to
try
it
here
as
its
a
new
brewery
reaching
the
area
drinkability
very
drinkable
brew
definitely
one
of
the
better
efforts
put
out
by
lakefront
d
smoothdrinking
with
a
very
interesting
flavor
profile
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
brew
and
hope
i
can
try
some
more
from
lakefront
in
the
future
d
delicious
id
definitely
have
another
well
crafted
with
a
good
balance
between
malts
and
hops
this
beer
pours
a
dark
amber
color
the
head
is
two
inches
in
height
and
recede
slowly
into
a
sticky
ring
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
a
perfect
balance
of
caramel
malt
and
citrus
hops
the
problem
is
that
it
is
very
faint
the
taste
is
a
mirror
image
of
the
aroma
nice
but
faint
honestly
from
what
i
detect
this
beer
is
very
simple
so
even
if
it
were
more
pronounced
i
still
dont
think
id
like
it
much
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
texture
that
is
a
little
thin
and
watery
for
the
style
overall
this
is
a
beer
that
is
truly
lacking
it
surely
reinforces
my
previous
conclusions
that
lakefront
brews
really
good
lagers
and
really
poor
ales
this
was
a
very
nice
surprise
ive
never
had
anything
from
this
brewery
and
was
going
out
on
a
limb
to
try
something
new
i
wasnt
disappointed
at
the
risk
of
sounding
blasphemous
this
kind
of
reminded
me
of
arrogant
bastard
not
as
robust
maybe
ab
light
definitely
one
of
the
better
lakefront
beers
ive
had
pours
dark
amber
with
a
very
thin
head
smells
citrusy
and
a
bit
piney
with
a
lot
of
firm
malt
and
a
slight
nuttiness
the
taste
is
rich
and
thick
with
malt
and
quite
creamy
but
not
too
sweet
lots
of
piney
hops
followed
by
a
touch
of
malty
sweetness
on
the
back
end
a
bit
thick
in
the
mouth
but
quite
smooth
big
and
with
lots
of
hops
and
a
fair
bit
of
alcohol
but
its
all
well
supported
by
the
malt
probably
the
best
lakefront
brew
ive
yet
had
heres
to
more
overall
a
nice
version
of
the
style
if
they
do
it
again
i
would
hope
for
more
hop
aroma
and
a
more
fresh
hop
flavor
instead
of
this
old
ipa
thing
still
not
bad
at
all
overall
good
beer
actually
like
it
more
then
some
other
american
strong
ales
such
as
the
hairy
eyeball
pours
a
dark
amber
almost
brown
color
with
a
frothy
white
head
strong
caramel
malt
and
hop
aroma
medium
bodied
with
a
great
balance
between
the
big
hop
and
malt
flavors
both
of
which
last
until
you
take
that
next
sip
this
would
be
an
excellent
session
beer
except
the
high
alcohol
content
will
put
you
on
your
butt
if
you
drink
the
whole
22
oz
bottle
best
enjoyed
with
a
friend
d
complex
and
tasty
bridge
burner
is
a
special
reserve
sipper
brewed
with
fierce
integrity
murky
brown
dubbel
like
appearance
was
not
all
that
attractive
but
the
head
atop
was
beige
two
finger
thick
and
decent
looking
the
aroma
was
a
lot
hopper
than
i
was
expecting
as
the
smell
of
resinous
hops
was
unmistakable
the
taste
matched
the
smell
with
drying
bitter
hop
taste
evident
up
front
backing
this
up
were
raisin
like
malts
that
was
not
too
sweet
the
body
was
soft
and
viscous
and
finish
very
dry
and
chalky
a
nice
strong
ale
i
would
love
revisiting
nicely
done
and
certainly
worth
a
try
if
youre
a
fan
of
stones
arrogant
bastard
d
this
one
goes
down
very
well
and
executes
nicely
i
really
dig
the
flavors
and
aromas
this
beer
is
very
much
like
an
arrogant
bastard
type
of
brew
but
i
think
that
is
a
good
thing
the
abv
is
somewhat
high
but
its
well
hidden
keeping
this
from
being
a
chore
to
get
down
i
think
this
beer
executes
well
and
was
worth
the
curiousity
i
am
not
mad
at
this
beer
creamy
flavor
with
a
small
amount
of
sweetness
this
is
quickly
lost
in
a
hop
bomb
rush
this
continues
through
the
swallow
and
long
into
the
aftertaste
the
body
is
surprisingly
thin
but
it
does
not
take
away
from
the
powerful
flavors
could
be
described
as
a
weakbodied
dipa
aroma
is
strong
and
rather
hoppy
but
not
fiercely
so
with
a
subtle
fruity
undertone
it
pours
a
clear
dark
coppery
amber
with
a
fairly
thick
slightly
yellow
beige
head
flavor
is
hoppy
but
not
too
bitter
and
has
a
firm
undertone
of
orange
texture
is
thick
smooth
and
fizzy
leaving
a
hopbitter
aftertaste
solid
brew
just
not
quite
in
my
top
tier
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
a
12
beige
head
over
the
clear
dark
copper
brew
dense
head
lasts
well
with
thick
frothy
lacing
aroma
is
heavily
sweet
with
piney
hops
taste
follows
the
nose
with
bitterness
overpowering
late
mouthfeel
is
creamy
smooth
cutting
the
bitter
some
and
drinkability
is
good
as
well
nice
beer
i
would
go
for
it
again
and
it
would
make
a
good
substitute
for
a
brown
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
good
kick
good
representation
of
style
i
wasnt
quite
sure
what
to
expect
from
this
beer
but
after
reading
the
label
and
then
smelling
the
beer
i
thought
i
would
like
it
more
than
i
actually
did
however
overall
i
consider
it
a
pretty
good
beer
that
is
worth
drinking
for
a
while
poured
a
deeper
and
clear
copper
color
with
a
large
sized
off
white
head
aromas
of
citrus
caramel
some
floral
hoppiness
and
just
a
tad
fruity
tastes
of
caramel
citrus
some
spicy
hops
and
some
fruitiness
the
body
was
a
little
on
the
thinner
side
lacing
left
on
the
glass
the
beer
goes
well
with
spicy
food
this
is
a
solid
brew
from
lakefront
its
nice
to
see
them
start
bottling
some
special
release
type
brews
and
the
price
tag
is
nice
compared
to
others
within
the
same
alcohol
range
id
pick
this
up
again
d
this
beer
has
some
interesting
depth
to
the
hops
but
the
malt
flavors
are
a
bit
off
and
not
really
that
big
i
dont
think
age
would
help
this
at
all
d
like
a
subdued
barleywine
but
very
nice
and
extremely
drinkable
for
a
strong
ale
different
from
the
regular
lineup
of
lakefront
beers
nice
to
see
them
venture
in
a
different
direction
drinkability
not
a
bad
little
asa
far
and
away
its
my
favorite
thing
to
come
out
of
lakefront
da
big
beefy
spicy
malt
bomb
lotsa
sweet
malt
but
enough
spce
to
keep
things
from
getting
carried
away
with
sweetness
a
very
generous
offering
while
taking
the
spectacular
lakefront
brewery
tour
d
just
cause
im
not
digging
it
i
wouldnt
drink
another
very
nice
very
drinkable
i
am
glad
i
have
a
bomber
dmy
friend
had
no
problem
putting
this
down
but
i
was
unable
pours
a
clear
darker
brown
nose
is
alcohol
and
wood
flavor
is
nice
smooth
with
cherry
wood
and
sweet
tones
not
really
complex
but
its
workin
nicer
as
it
warms
feel
is
sticky
and
smooth
and
a
bit
silky
as
well
nice
to
drink
this
might
be
interestng
on
cask
overall
this
brew
resembles
the
anniversary
brew
only
less
meaty
and
less
salty
not
a
bad
brew
for
a
bbq
but
a
little
too
salty
for
casual
drinking
d
pretty
damn
tasty
this
is
actually
on
cask
at
the
great
taste
tomorrow
which
should
be
outstanding
for
this
so
just
another
thing
to
get
more
excited
about
d
damn
drinkable
the
best
beer
i
have
ever
had
from
lakefront
i
bought
this
22oz
bomber
at
3
cellars
in
franklin
wi
some
lighter
fruits
continue
to
come
out
as
it
warms
a
touch
of
pear
but
still
dominated
by
the
deep
caramel
a
touch
of
cough
syrup
as
well
yeah
this
guys
ideal
serving
temperature
is
a
little
lower
not
a
bad
thing
just
something
worth
noting
i
wouldnt
want
to
drink
a
gueuze
icecold
nor
would
i
want
to
drink
a
pilsner
at
room
temperature
but
the
reverse
is
genius
treat
it
like
a
lager
and
it
will
treat
you
well
while
this
is
certainly
no
arrogant
bastard
its
still
a
very
good
beer
in
its
own
right
dispite
the
hopmalt
profile
being
a
bit
confusing
at
first
take
surely
one
of
lakefronts
better
beers
22
ouncer
the
informative
back
label
tells
me
this
was
brewed
during
the
first
week
of
june
2008
pours
a
nice
rich
shade
of
dark
amberauburn
under
a
medium
tan
head
that
shows
world
class
retention
and
then
leaves
extensive
frothy
and
well
developed
lace
and
sheeting
malty
nose
with
traces
of
honey
and
nuts
smooth
tasty
bald
complex
and
thoroughly
enjoyable
asa
lots
of
nutty
malts
some
woodsmoke
honey
and
dark
bread
notes
yum
a
very
nice
smooth
and
mellow
take
on
the
style
with
the
8
well
in
the
rear
this
one
is
well
worth
trying
and
enjoying
with
some
chedder
bread
and
smoky
meaty
nice
job
here
from
lakefront
brewing
dsort
of
a
beer
that
seems
lost
to
me
not
powerful
or
rich
enough
for
a
barleywine
but
not
malty
enough
for
a
strong
ale
not
a
bad
hybrid
but
there
just
seems
to
be
a
bit
missing
on
the
balance
one
thing
is
for
sure
this
beer
greatly
improves
as
it
warms
to
room
temp
its
no
facemelter
just
a
wellstated
balanced
big
ale
with
a
lot
of
drinkability
ill
need
to
track
down
another
to
see
what
the
deal
is
with
the
co2
more
for
curiositiys
sake
than
redemption
as
this
works
as
it
is
aroma
bourbon
malt
vanilla
no
hops
appearance
dark
brown
head
that
quickly
dissipates
flavor
rich
malt
flavors
slight
chocolate
caramel
some
vanilla
with
bourbon
in
the
background
a
touch
sweet
but
balances
the
malt
and
bourbon
flavors
mouthfeel
moderate
body
to
moderate
full
moderate
carbonation
overall
the
bourbon
flavor
is
very
well
done
and
the
rich
malt
goes
very
well
with
the
bourbon
barrel
aging
the
alcohol
is
there
but
is
not
as
noticeable
as
9
1
alcohol
would
suggest
it
is
very
smooth
and
drinkable
the
nose
is
relatively
light
with
coconut
and
chocolate
the
flavor
has
light
malt
and
grain
but
a
stronger
chocolate
and
coconut
mid
palate
to
finish
this
isnt
particularly
complex
strong
or
even
interesting
but
its
a
good
drinking
beer
and
thats
all
im
in
it
for
overall
a
nice
dark
ale
enjoyable
and
drinkable
overall
it
is
a
good
strong
ale
a
bit
hoppy
and
i
have
to
get
used
to
the
dark
color
but
the
mouth
feel
is
nice
and
full
making
it
an
enjoyable
drink
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
but
jumps
up
at
you
about
half
way
through
the
glass
the
flavors
of
the
malts
and
hops
are
each
pronounced
and
singular
rather
than
being
molded
into
a
smooth
blend
sharing
the
glass
had
in
vegas
at
random
bar
havent
heard
of
cold
springs
brewery
on
east
coast
this
starts
with
a
popping
9
and
heavy
bourbon
smell
right
off
he
bat
this
pours
extremely
dark
with
little
to
no
head
bourbon
dominates
here
with
a
great
malty
presence
this
separates
itself
from
other
strong
ales
as
the
alcohol
doesnt
overwhelm
the
drink
this
would
be
perfect
on
a
cold
day
i
will
drink
it
until
it
gets
cold
out
as
a
result
great
find
dark
brown
ale
with
a
light
brown
head
has
a
bourbon
aroma
and
a
strong
bourbon
flavor
with
some
toasty
malts
in
the
mix
sits
nice
and
warm
in
the
stomach
the
bourbon
for
me
is
a
touch
overpowering
highly
recommended
for
those
who
love
the
taste
of
bourbon
still
i
find
this
a
good
brew
overall
o
knowing
nothing
about
the
brewery
but
being
intrigued
by
the
description
of
the
beer
itself
i
didnt
really
have
any
expectations
that
said
this
is
a
great
beer
perhaps
not
the
best
of
strong
oakedbarrel
aged
beers
but
a
damn
good
beer
definitely
recommended
if
you
can
find
it
ive
only
seen
it
at
a
couple
places
in
the
sacramento
area
o
solid
brew
nice
bourbon
malt
mix
o
very
nice
balanced
and
flavorful
many
times
with
a
strong
ale
you
taste
the
alcohol
not
with
this
very
nice
could
get
into
trouble
fast
with
this
one
o
flawed
yet
endearing
thats
my
takeaway
from
this
its
hardly
perfect
and
honestly
thats
why
i
enjoy
it
so
much
this
is
one
of
those
few
beers
that
take
you
on
a
wild
ride
some
of
the
stops
on
the
journey
arent
the
greatest
but
the
end
result
is
something
that
leaves
you
craving
for
more
i
could
do
another
bottle
of
this
honestly
from
a
750ml
winebottle
shaped
container
the
beer
pours
an
intense
dark
brown
with
hints
of
ruby
when
held
to
the
light
tan
foam
tops
the
beer
the
smell
is
malt
and
alcohol
some
caramel
and
slightly
bunt
toffee
the
taste
is
sugary
sweet
and
boozy
firm
bitterness
in
the
finish
the
beer
is
very
full
in
body
and
a
little
sweet
at
times
overall
far
from
the
best
bourbon
ale
but
quite
a
steal
at
just
2
69
a
bottle
taste
is
smooth
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
it
kind
of
reminds
me
of
a
roasted
malt
version
of
kentucky
bourbon
ale
i
would
definitely
drink
it
again
750

served
in
a

snifter
the
beer
pours
dark
brown
with
about
an
inch
tan
head
head
retention
is
good
and
theres
a
decent
amount
of
lacing
aroma
is
nice
the
brew
smells
like
molasses
vanilla
dark
fruit
oak
and
chocolate
it
tastes
like
oakwood
dark
fruit
bittersweet
chocolate
vanilla
bourbon
and
some
molasses
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
a
bit
slick
and
has
moderate
carbonation
the
bourbon
character
seems
stronger
in
the
aroma
as
compared
to
the
taste
i
liked
this
brew
but
i
wish
there
was
a
little
more
of
a
bourbon
kick
still
for
7
99
a
bottle
its
certainly
worth
trying
i
had
this
with
a
peanut
butter
sandwich
as
a
late
night
snack
the
two
flavors
paired
well
a
very
good
and
flavorful
ale
worth
trying
masks
the
strength
pretty
well
but
its
a
sipper
good
body
and
complex
flavor
worth
having
o
a
really
compelling
dark
beer
dry
and
bitter
but
with
a
bit
of
bittersweet
chocolate
sweetness
to
fall
back
on
great
work
done
with
the
malts
try
it
you
may
like
it
overall
for
the
price
and
ease
of
drinking
i
plan
to
come
back
to
this
one
and
will
try
the
other
john
henry
offerings
nice
job
on
this
one
after
having
another
i
had
to
come
back
and
rate
it
higher
on
taste
it
does
not
have
to
be
complex
to
very
enjoyable
a
very
good
beer
and
i
think
a
great
price
at
2
50
a
bottle
would
love
to
try
it
again
taste
starts
chocolatey
sweet
with
a
touch
of
fusel
upfront
creamy
in
the
middle
with
a
lightly
boozy
close
and
a
lingering
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
pretty
smooth
and
drinkability
is
alright
doesnt
quite
all
come
together
as
well
as
i
would
hope
but
not
too
bad
great
beer
from
start
to

especially
for

alcvol
easy

an
great
to
have
with
steaks
or
other
food
parings
depending
on
your
food
preference
love
the
idea
of
aging
on
bourbon
oak
chips
plus
it
being
minnesota
brew
scores
more
points
in
my
book
love
all
three
varieties
that
cold
spring
brewing
offers
the
mouthfeel
is
close
to
full
but
a
little
thinner
than
i
expected
carbonation
is
slightly
flat
but
not
too
bad
slight
bite
from
the
alcohol
and
a
little
bit
of
an
earthy
finish
at
the
end
sort
of
acidic
fairly
drinkable
more
of
a
sipper
overall
worth
trying
overall
a
great
brew
with
a
great
abv

typical
roasted

easy
to
bring
down
overall
classic
good
not
greattons
of
roasted

going
on
here
and
playing
well
but
theres
something
missing
that
would
take
this
ale
to
another
levelfor
the
higher
abv
its
very
drinkable
and
lightif
it
were
a
little
chewier
more
of

nothing
that
stands
out3
55
final
thoughts
for
what
it
is
and
the
price
point
8
99
for
a
four
pack
its
not
a
bad
deal
it
would
work
well
as
an
introductory
beer
for
someone
just
getting
into
oak
aged
ales
however
it
doesnt
pack
the
bourbon
punch
that
was
expected
and
lacks
in
body
would
i
drink
it
again
lets
put
it
this
way
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
overall
a
nice
asa
that
does
well
with
the
addition
of
bourbon
oak
chips
some
slight
off
flavors
but
still
a
good
beer
overall
o
i
had
no
real
expectations
when
i
cracked
this
but
was
pleasantly
surprised
and
am
really
glad
i
gave
this
beer
a
try
i
would
buy
this
again
and
would
definitely
recommend
it
to
those
who
like
roasted
malt
bombs
a
pretty
drinkable
strong
ale
drinks
like
a
nice
imperial
vanilla
porter
to
me
has
more
chocolate
and
vanilla
qualities
than
it
does
bourbon
but
the
oak
does
come
through
a
touch
dark
rich
smooth
amazing
balance
of
oak
smoke
and
bourbon
all
come
together
in
a
fantastic
beer
pours
a
deep
amber
to
black
in
color
with
a
tan

in
the
aroma

a
small
bourbon
like
presence
in
the
taste
oaky
notes
of
bourbon
a
touch
watery
but
decent
a
small
bite
and
a
medium
to
lighter
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
oak
and
small
bourbon
presence
in
the
aftertaste
a
bit
thin
and
a
touch
watery
with
a
decent
flavor
not
to
shabby
medium
mouthfeel
and

carbonation
bottle
from
flanders
ned
overall
i
quite
like
this
beer
im
rating
it
a
lot
higher
than
other
reviewers
but
despite
its
provenance
cold
spring
isnt
necessarily
a
strongale
powerhouse
this
beer
has
a
lot
of
good
flavor
and
a
smooth
drinkability
good
on
ya
cold
spring
however
with
that
said
could
this
beer
be
improved
yes
do
i
recommend
it
yes
smells
quite
boozey
with
bourbon
but
its
not
really
a
sort
of
wellbalanced
bourbon
aroma
its
more
chocolatevanilla
smell
than
wood
smell
and
unusually
sweet
and
ripe
in
tone
reminding
me
more
of
a
rail
bourbon
than
a
name
brand
the
flavor
is
similar
to
the
nose
but
at
a
relatively
muted
level
and
somewhat
drier
compared
to
the
nose
and
the
malts
are
somewhat
lost
in
the
shuffle
at
times
underneath
the
bourbon
its
an
average
sort
of
beginners
introduction
to
bourbon
beers
but
overall
it
gives
off
the
impression
of
being
raw
unbalanced
and
im
not
quite
sure
that
cellaring
would
fix
it
given
the
odd
disparity
of
sweetness
between
the
nose
and
the
flavor
this
beer
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
1
finger
tan
head
and
thin
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
dark
fruit
dark
roast
and
a
hint
of
smoke
the
flavor
is
plums
roasted
malt
and
wood
notes
with
a
heap
of
coffee
in
the
finish
theres
a
mild
alcohol
burn
as
it
warms
its
mouthfeel
is
full
and
a
bit
syrupy
cold

beer
recommended
o
a
solid
beer
overall
not
terribly
complex
but
enjoyable
enough
didnt
have
high
expectations
for
this
one

i
actually
enjoyed
it
nice

though
the
alcohol
wont
hurt
to
be
toned
down
just
a
bit
pours
an
opaque
dark
brown
with
a
foamy
dark

settles
to
a
film
on

of
the
beer
small
streaks

form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
smell
is
of
toasted

and
bourbon
taste
is
much
the
same
with
distinct
roasty
and
soy
sauce
flavors
as
well
there
is
a
mild
roasty
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
has
a
good
aroma
but
the
flavor
just
doesnt
match
up
despite
nice
dark
appearance
thick
head
and
reasonably
good
body
this
beer
was
disappointing
its
not
very
well
balanced
imho
not
enough
hop
flavor
and
an
overabundance
of
maltiness
though
it
does
have
a
nice
finish
it
seems
like
there
is
something
missing
and
i
wonder
if
i
simply
got
a
bad
batch
seems
unlikely
but
i
suppose
its
possible
where
is
the
base
beer
i
kind
of
feel
like
i
could
put
bourbon
oak
chips
in
water
to
come
up
with
the
same
thing
i
enjoyed
the
sweet
flavors
at
first
but
it
left
me
wanting
more
overall
i
expect
more
from
anything
that
is
bourbon
aged
especially
if
im
only
getting
four
bottles
of
it
this
is
an
average
beer
that
id
consider
a
gateway
into
the
intensity
of
anything
oak
aged
but
its
not
worth
the
price
tag
that
comes
with
it
id
gladly
pass
this
up
for
new
hollands
dragons
milk
or
arcadias
shipwreck
porter
dont
judge
a
beer
by
its
appearance
lesson
learned
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
regardless
of
style
its
pretty
much
a
liquid
dessert
and
you
cannot
go
wrong
pick
this
up
open
it
up
and
enjoy

still

they

the
taste
was

rather
sweet
for
my
taste
but
still
not
bad
the
finish
was
where
the
bourbon
chips
really
asserted
themselves
and
combined
with
the
inherent
heat
of
the
beer
i
felt
like
i
had
been
drinking
spirits
i
am
a
beer
drinker
for
a
reason
i
can
usually
realize
my
limit
and
ramp
back
or
stop
but
liquor
for
me
is
like
standing
on
the
edge
of
the
abyss
and
looking
down
when
i
drink
liquor
i
break
out
in
handcuffs
this
was
a
novelty
and
a
onceanddone
for
me
overall
this
beer
was
decent
but
the
flavor
profile
seemed
a
bit
disjointed
to
me
worthy
of
a
try
the
beer
pours
dark
black
with
an
inch
of
dense
tan
head
that
holds
on
tightly
the
nose

alcohol
that
gets

it
warms

also
much
more
pronounced

warm
and

the
taste
brings
forward
more
of
the
yeasts
fruitiness
which
i
expected
to
find
in
nose
there
is
some
subtle
roastiness
in
the

finish
that
dries
out
the
beers
semisweet
medium
body
the
bourbonwood
doesnt
carry
through
to
the

taste
as
i
would
have
preferred
but
its
very
smooth
and
drinkable
nonetheless
although
this
beer
is
labeled
as
a
strong
ale
i
would
have
compared
it
to
a
strong
porter
or
stout
instead
the
lacking
yeast
characterfullbodied
sweetness
brings
this
beer
down
to
being
slightly
better
than
average
despite
its
drinkability

and
the

the
main
flavor
though
its
a
good
effort
would
drink
again
though
they
dont
seem
to
be
pushing
this
one
its
a
resounding
homerun
against
their
regular

not

intense
as
the
aroma

combines
the
dark

bourbon
and
oak
flavor
fades
rather
quickly
but
leaves
a
pleasant
oaky
sweet
malt
aftertaste
a
slight
astringency
to
the
finish
that
was
not
great
but
was
moderated
by
the
other
flavors
medium
bodied
not
quite
reaching
creaminess
with
more
intensity
of
flavor
could
compete
with
the
top
tier
oak

reaches
for
the
ring
but
misses
on
the
other
hand
the
flavor
is
light
but
complex
and
well
integrated
i
enjoyed
this
strong
ale
and
will
buy
it
again
in
general
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
and
considering
cold
spring
made
one
of
the
worst
beers
i
have
ever
tried
i
can
say
at
this
point
that
i
can
forgive
them
for
making
hackstein
light
overall
lots
of
things
going
for
it
in
the
aroma
but
the
taste
falls
flat
tough
to
drink
not
something
id
drink
again
very
dark
brown
with
a
black
appearance

khaki
colored

with

interesting
robust
combination
between
oaked
mahogany
rich

and

flows
into
a
big

boozy
mildly
nutty
overall
flavor
hints
of
orange
and
maple
make
their
way
through
eventually
to
a
boozy
woody
finish
overall
a
decent
sipper
my
first
experience
trying
a
cold
spring
brew
doa
john
henry
is
a
9
1
so
it
has
a
substantial
alchohol
flavor
that
pairs
with
dessert
that
is
how
i
will
use
this
case
i
feel
like
this
beer
would
be
outstanding
at
a
pub
on
tap
the
case
was
clearly
marked
ale
aged
on
bourbon
oak
chips
so
my
bad
it
was
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
very
heavy
oak
flavor
mutes
most
everything
else
not
a
thriller
bottom
line
worth
a
try
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
something
i
would
buy
again
the
best
part
of
this
beer
is
the
abv
it
is
very
smooth
considering
higher
alcohol
levels
this
style
confounds
me
bourbon
oak
chips
the
bourbon
barrel
branding
is
deceptive
considering
the
minimal
and
weak
presence
of
bourbon
in
the
taste
and
smell
id
rather
have
a
truly
barrelaged
beer
that
exudes
bourbon
character
in
a
much
better
fashion
overall
this
is
just
ok
no
real
reason
to
buy
again
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
black
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
bourbon
somewhat
sweet
taste
is
also
bourbon
up
front
considerable
malty
sweetness
a
touch
of
alcohol
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
was
a
unique
and
enjoyable
beer
and
worth
giving
a
try
overall
good
beer
maybe
not
quite
to
style
but
its
quite
tasty
o
i
was
suprised
by
this
beer
its
very
well
crafted
and
a
lot
better
then
most
other
bourbon
barrel
attempts
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
dark
shade
of
gold
almost
a
brown
color
with
a
thin
white
head
on
top
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
malty
rich
and
roasted
not
much
of
a
hoppiness
there
the
taste
of
the
beer
was
decent
as
it
warmed
up
there
were
some
really
interesting
vanilla
flavors
that
came
through
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
was
average
to
me
it
had
a
good
body
but
i
just
felt
it
was
missing
something
overall
i
was
a
little
bit
surprised
by
this
beer
i
was
glad
i
tried
it
overall
not
too
bad
im
not
sure
ill
buy
it
again
anytime
soon
but
its
worth
the
try
its
enjoyable
enough
if
priced
right
i
paid
11
a
4pack
which
is
fair
m
not
the
easiest
beer
to
drink
but
the
character
of
this
one
is
good
enough
for
enjoying
it
cheers
o
good
beer
but
not
great
could
really
benefit
from
the
full
treatment
of
barrelaging
instead
of
just
aging
it
with
oak
chips
i
support
mn
microbrewing
best
i
can
but
i
usually
have
to
look
to
a
company
outside
the
state
to
find
something
i
can
really
enjoy
final
thought
9
1
abv
is
nice
but
the
price
at
11
a
sixer
is
not
my
fav
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
could
really
be
improved
if
it
was
a
little
more
balanced
i
feel
the
body
was
the
most
lacking
part
of
this
beer
i
dont
know
if
that
is
fixable
without
negatively
changing
the
flavor
overall
worth
a
try
another
good
american
strong
ale
from
california
my
wife
picked
this
one
out
and
i
have
to
say
she
did
well
it
is
a
well
put
together
and
tasty
brew
if
i
remember
correctly
it
was
also
fairly
affordable
i
would
definitely
consider
picking
up
a
bottle
or
this
in
the
future
o
a
interesting
balanced
beer
it
certainly
has
its
place
among
some
of
the
more
extreme
strong
ales
but
no
risks
are
taken
enjoyable
none
the
less
o
very
good
beer
nicely
drinkable
and
delic
nice
beer
good
roast
flavor
will
probably
get
better
aged
weird
little
bottle
found
on
the
shelf
at
julios
today
looks
like
a
macro
in
micro
clothing
to
me
but
im
a
sucker
for
oak
aged
so
the
bottle
made
its
way
home
with
me
pours
a
solid
dark
brownblack
with
a
thinnish
tan
head
that
dissipates
almost
instantly
smells
of
brown
sugar
vanilla
caramel
dark
fruit
earthy
and
woody
this
is
listed
as
a
strong
ale
the
website
describes
this
as
an
imperial
stout
it
smells
like
a
cross
between
a
belgian
dark
strong
and
a
porter
there
isnt
much
roast
in
the
aroma
or
in
the
taste
for
that
matter
taste
is
sweet
and
malty
with
dark
sugars
and
fruits
dominating
the
taste
slight
alcohol
and
earthy
hop
in
there
as
well
bit
of
a
roasted
grain
ash
in
the
finish
medium
body
and
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slick
watery
mouthfeel
decent
brew
but
really
nothing
special
here
i
have
my
doubts
that
the
cold
spring
brewery
actually
exists
but
i
wont
lose
much
sleep
over
it
black
malt
and
toasty
flavors
raisiny
and
roasted
like
a
dark
belgian
a
pleasant
boozy
smell
with
a
nice
whack
of
vanilla
and
whiskey
rich
mouthfeel
but
not
viscous
slightly
sweet
but
has
a
fruity
tartness
and
maybe
a
little
sour
from
the
burnt
barley
a
bit
of
a
winey
character
not
tasting
overly
strong
of
alcohol
the
chocolate
malt
and
woody
flavors
seem
to
make
it
play
well
an
interesting
turn
on
the
black
beers
kind
of
a
free
spirit
you
could
call
it
an
old
ale
as
it
has
that
hint
of
rusty
flavor
but
somehow
different
from
the
big
stouts
overall
i
would
seek
this
out
again
if
i
had
nothing
else
close
in
the
sto
that
compares
it
does
not
leave
a
lasting
impression
but
not
bad
o
a
very
good
beer
i
will
be
getting
this
one
again
overall
a
tasty
brew
with
lots
of
character
surprisingly
drinkable
and
a
musttry
from
cold
spring
brewing
co
solid
medium
body
more
carbonation
than
in
the
appearance
pretty
warming
actually
reminded
me
quite
a
bit
of
new
holland
dragons
milk
overall
a
good
beer
in
a
category
which
has
the
potential
to
be
completely
terrible
go
cold
spring
o
could
only
drink
one
of
these
both
for
abv
and
thickness
and
robust
taste
its
a
tongue
and
palate
coater
but
a
tasty
one
overall
i
was
totally
and
completely
blown
away
by
this
beer
insanely
complex
and
great
flavor
profile
and
is
incredibly
easy
to
drink
for
it
being
9
1
abv
well
done
and
highly
recommended
i
finally
got
to
try
this
beer
as
casanovas
had
a
single
you
can
definitely
taste
the
contributions
of
the
bourbon
oak
chips
in
this
beer
but
the
base
beer
doesnt
add
too
much
a
pretty
good
beer
definitely
the
best
cold
spring
offering
ive
had
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
pretty
good
american
strong
ale
most
beers
with
the
word
bourbon
in
their
name
have
a
pretty
dominating
bourbon
aspect
to
them
this
one
didnt
and
i
thought
that
worked
well
with
this
brew
the
lightness
of
the
bourbon
must
be
because
it
was
aged
on
bourbon
oak
chips
instead
of
being
aged
in
the
barrel
it
seems
like
by
using
the
chips
you
have
more
control
on
how
bourbony
the
beer
will
be
instead
of
just
throwing
it
in
the
barrel
and
praying
for
the
best
the
nicely
blended
bourbon
aspect
of
this
beer
would
make
this
a
great
beer
to
introduce
people
to
bourbon
beers
it
gives
you
a
taste
of
the
bourbon
but
it
doesnt
hit
you
over
the
head
with
bourbon
and
that
can
be
too
much
for
people
who
arent
used
to
it
what
i
liked
most
about
this
beer
was
its
balance
and
how
nicely
blended
the
flavors
were
what
i
liked
least
about
this
beer
was
its
lack
of
carbonation
it
was
pretty
close
to
being
flat
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
it
has
a
good
price
point
compared
to
the
other
bourbon
beesr
and
it
would
make
a
good
go
to
bourbon
beer
if
bourbon
beers
are
your
thing
give
it
a
try
its
nice
to
have
something
other
then
a
stout
that
has
the
bourbon
treatment
and
if
your
are
wanting
to
get
into
bourbon
beers
this
is
a
pretty
good
place
to
start
this
was
a
good
first
impression
for
cold
spring
brewing
company
before
this
beer
this
brewery
wasnt
even
on
my
radar
but
now
that
i
have
tried
it
i
will
be
on
the
look
out
for
other
beers
from
them
good
job
guys
thanks
for
making
a
nice
strong
ale
with
bourbon
flavors
and
not
a
bourbon
bomb
first
sip
is
a
bit
mellower
than
what
i
was
expecting
usually
when
breweries
are
so
bold
as
to
market
a
beer
as
aged
in
bourbon
barrels
it
comes
off
as
something
a
bit
more
intense
like
a
bourbon
county
of
a
kentucky
breakfast
maybe
the
fine
details
are
in
the
statement
aged
on
bourbon
oak
chips
and
not
specifically
bourbon
barrels
either
way
the
beer
is
still
very
nuanced
and
has
a
great
body
to
it
in
fact
i
might
recommend
it
over
some
of
the
other
beers
as
this
may
be
much
more
palatable
than
the
rest
to
someone
whos
never
tried
such
a
style
before
overall
a
better
than
expected
oaked
strong
ale
well
quite
the
name
this
one
has
it
wa
spoured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
at
cellar
temp
a
dark
brown
with
a
thin
tan
head
nose
has
big
malts
oak
and
whiskey
also
some
vanilla
coconut
candy
and
booze
taste
is
thin
and
lacks
complexity
as
is
the
body
overall
this
is
pretty
average
for
anything
even
trying
to
do
anything
barrel
aged
it
lacks
the
complexity
of
many
bourbon
barrel
aged
beers
do
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
one
didnt
really
know
what
to
expect
when
i
picked
up
a
single
had
always
saw
ads
for
it
in
beer
magazines
and
it
looked
interesting
enough
would
drink
again
i
liked
this
this
is
easily
the
best
beer
ive
had
from
these
guys
by
far
would
hapily
buy
this
again
if
it
makes
it
down
this
way
god
knows
enough
of
their
cheap
crap
doea
a
deep
dark
cloudy
molasses
color
with
a
thin
creamy
khaki
head
that
gives
way
to
thick
curtains
the
nose
is
sweet
and
buttery
with
movie
theatre
popcorn
goobers
toffee
along
with
sweet
buttery
vanilla
oak
the
tasty
is
syrupy
sweet
with
black
strap
molasses
vanilla
a
hint
of
corn
and
sweet
bourbony
caramel
along
with
a
weird
metallic
note
at
the
end
not
that
good
of
a
beer
deep
dark
pour
that
resembles
molasses
a
finger
and
a
half
of
mocha
head
a
little
lacing
remains
really
nothing
moving
or
impressive
in
my
glass
big
bourbon
booze
with
fig
and
plum
on
the
nose
like
a
fig
newton
gone
rogue
carbonation
isnt
bad
you
want
it
to
feel
creamy
but
it
quickly
says
no
soup
for
you
in
the
taste
the
bourbon
is
forefront
then
its
quickly
followed
by
a
wood
like
medicinal
booziness
crushed
aspirin
in
my
beer
oh
joy
this
really
smelled
like
it
had
a
possibility
maybe
im
incredibly
fussy
flat
out
this
beer
sucked
overall
and
interesting
beer
i
really
dont
see
many
american
dark
strong
ales
around
but
compared
to
the
few
ive
had
this
is
very
good
similar
to
a
bourbon
barrel
aged
stout
with
less
of
the
smokey
hoppy
harshness
that
some
stronger
stouts
have
a
very
smooth
easy
drinking
beer
for
a
dark
ale
that
is
around
9
abv
im
glad
i
finally
tried
this
beer
but
probably
wouldnt
seek
it
out
again
ofine
for
what
it
is
but
not
terribly
interesting
its
very
easy
to
drink
and
masks
the
alcohol
well
overall
this
is
a
well
made
beer
that
i
would
not
hesitate
to
try
again

i
usually
hate
the
idea
of
a
woody
oaky
vanillaladen
aso
with
this
and
the
oakaged
ab
being
the
exception
this
is
a
quality
ale
done
right
by
no
accident
that
stands
apart
from
the
pack
d
i
got
to
try
about
3
ozs
of
this
a
few
months
ago
and
remembered
liiking
it
so
i
was
really
glad
to
get
a
bottle
of
this
to
review
i
remembered
it
having
a
great
smell
which
it
lived
up
to
lots
of
cream
and
vanilla
mixing
with
chocolate
and
caramel
malts
with
nice
bourbon
and
oak
added
to
it
unfortunately
the
taste
seemed
a
little
flat
and
faded
though
it
was
still
decent
a
nice
beer
i
would
like
to
try
fresh
sometime
i
dunno
i
mean
john
henry
3
lick
spiker
ale
is
a
pretty
good
beer
overall
rather
stoutlike
id
say
but
there
is
next
to
no
bourbon
character
to
me
it
tastes
more
like
a
lightlyhopped
ris
than
anything
good
but
not
as
advertised
is
my
final
assessment
in
the
beers
defense
there
is
next
to
no
booziness
making
it
pretty
dang
drinkable
d
the
alcohol
is
hidden
well
in
this
its
got
some
good
aspects
going
on
but
seems
to
be
lacking
something
decent
drinkability
though
note
bottle
code
jcbj
0915
d
overall
a
very
average
beer
not
sure
if
this
is
best
fresh
or
aged
not
sure
what
my
bottle
is
on
that
scale
but
nothing
makes
me
want
to
buy
it
again
notes
not
too
shaby
at
all
a
good
one
to
pick
up
and
i
shall
pick
up
again
cheers
tried
this
in
my
prereviewing
days
and
enjoyed
it
so
i
figured
id
give
it
another
go
and
get
a
tick
while
im
at
it
it
pours
a
seemingly
opaque
blackbrown
topped
by
a
finger
of
ecru
foam
which
settles
out
into
a
ring
momentarily
the
nose
comprises
bourbon
oak
vanilla
caramel
butter
and
plenty
o
booze
if
it
werent
for
the
last
blast
of
alcohol
it
wouldnt
be
so
bad
but
instead
it
burns
us
a
bit
too
much
the
taste
holds
notes
of
bourbon
wood
chocolate
and
roasted
malts
but
these
are
singed
away
by
that
pesky
alcohol
boo
some
cedar
lingers
in
the
aftertaste
the
body
is
a
heftyfeeling
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
dryish
finish
overall
way
too
boozy
and
uneven
to
work
properly
it
could
have
turned
out
okay
but
alas
by
far
this
is
gotta
be
the
best
offering
from
cold
spring
brewery
thank
you
brewseum
d
the
nose
and
mouthfeel
are
nice
but
the
flavor
falls
way
short
even
after
letting
this
one
warm
up
a
fair
amount
it
was
still
pretty
plain
and
woody
12oz
bottle
served
in
a
standard
pint
glass
pours
the
color
and
clarity
of
cola
with
a
thin
tancolored
head
the
quickly
disperses
towards
the
shoulders
forming
a
thin
band
no
lacing
on
this
one
pleasant
nose
faint
bourbon
notes
and
a
slight
buttery
quality
on
a
malty
backbone
taste
consistent
with
nose
with
the
addition
of
toffee
and
vanilla
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
with
an
even
easy
carbonation
this
is
a
really
flavorful
and
drinkable
bourbon
imparted
beer
not
at
all
boozy
but
imparted
with
some
exceptional
flavor
without
being
cloying
well
worth
a
try
if
you
get
the
opportunity
i
bet
this
would
be
fantastic
on
cask
loved
it
and
i
will
be
buying
more
really
an
interesting
beer
that
rides
a
fine
line
between
ale
porter
stout
imperial
something
oak
aged
bourbon
and
whatnot
its
never
over
the
top
anywhere
but
very
nicely
balanced
really
a
very
good
beer
some
distinct
and
flattering
flavors
however
the
imbalance
both
in
flavor
and
texture
make
it
tough
to
have
more
than
one
overall
different
and
cheap
so
try
it
this
beer
might
work
okay
as
a
vanilla
float
as
the
bitterness
is
low
enough
and
the
already
apparent
vanilla
flavor
may
blend
adequately
while
this
isnt
terrible
it
is
rather
hard
to
get
through
the
whole
bottle
even
if
im
adequately
distracted
thats
not
a
good
sign
d
hard
time
having
more
than
one
relatively
tasteless
on
the
initial
sip
that
gives
way
to
a
strong
molasses
toasted
malt
flavor
with
a
powerful
alcohol
content
very
thin
body
for
the
style
with
an
equally
low
carbonation
would
not
want
to
drink
more
than
one
of
these
at
a
time
maybe
as
a
dessert
beer
has
some
drinkability
for
the
abv
thats
about
it
d
not
real
drinkable
pretty
mammoth
and
intimidating
and
intense
probably
wouldnt
get
this
again
but
a
pretty
good
beer
overall
d
very
good
but
not
sure
id
buy
this
again
overall
not
bad
fairly
complex
actually
but
just
didnt
do
much
for
me
i
wouldnt
spend
my
money
on
this
but
for
free
im
glad
i
got
to
try
it
overall
this
is
an
okay
beer
and
i
can
enjoy
it
but
would
not
want
a
whole
lot
at
any
given
sitting
some
alcohol
presence
but
not
too
much
drinks
rather
well
for
a
beer
that
skirts
any
style
guidelines
decently
complex
but
not
terrific
i
would
definitely
try
this
again
as
it
was
a
complete
impulse
buy
if
you
put
the
words
bourbon
and
aged
on
a
beer
label
price
it
under
10
and
i
will
try
it
this
didnt
let
me
down
though
it
didnt
quite
wow
me
either
f
the
booze
starts
to
show
a
little
towards
the
end
it
gets
a
slight
boozy
taste
as
well
as
some
alcohol
warmth
and
tingle
its
still
sweet
on
the
finish
with
a
little
more
barley
more
syrups
brown
sugar
etc
also
the
bourbon
sticks
around
through
the
finish
and
lingers
on
the
tongue
more
molasses
as
well
on
the
finish
no
real
oak
here
though
db
the
oak
flavor
here
is
the
best
thing
about
this
beer
the
whiskey
is
somewhat
subdued
but
works
in
this
case
i
think
this
beer
is
fairly
underrated
i
would
have
to
say
it
is
the
most
drinkable
bourbon
influenced
ale
i
can
think
of
nice
job
i
could
session
this
thing
great
price
too
it
is
a
shame
its
looks
were
so
weak
overall
not
a
horrible
brew
by
any
meansjust
not
my
shtick
i
can
definitely
see
how
other
people
can
enjoy
this
if
you
prefer
your
beers
on
the
sweeter
side
andor
are

is
worth
a

m
d
amazing
incredibly
mild
for
a

abv
beer
aack
whoa
totally
unexpected
with
an
aggresive
pour
got
a
smallish
tan
head
that
quickly
subsides
color
is
an
opaque
very
dark
brown
aroma
is
vanilla
chocolate
malt
flavor
is
massively
cherry
and
then
a
few
other
components
vanilla
and
man
i
just
cant
get
away
from
the
cherry
body
is
ok
and
so
is
carbonation
finish
is
like
flavor
could
cook
with
it
or
give
it
to
someone
who
likes
dark
cherry
beer
but
its
definitely
not
for
moi
the
mouthfeel
is
solid
malty
and
thick
this
bad
boy
lets
you
know
hes
in
there
kickin
some
taste
bud
ass
overall
i
think
this
is
a
quality
brew
rivals
the
oaked
arrogant
bastard
to
be
honest
and
the
price
was
better
too
i
will
definitely
be
buying
some
of
this
again
the
taste
is
just
like
the
aroma
oak
vanilla
booze
and
caramel
not
very
strong
with
flavor
but
decent
for
what
it
is
medium
bodied
with
decent
carbonation
nothing
to
get
to
excited
about
decent
drinkability
the
body
was
a
bit
too
thin
for
a
beer
this
strong
and
flavorful
drinkability
was
pretty
good
for
a
beer
this
size
although
the
bourbon
can
be
a
bit
powerful
and
could
affect
how
you
view
drinkability
overall
a
pretty
good
brew
worth
trying
if
you
see
it
da
little
strong
for
a
session
but
easy
to
drink
the
bottle
drinkability
is
just
ok
since
its
strong
in
alc
and
flavor
per
sip
this
might
be
offputting
to
some
but
i
could
put
back
3
of
these
easy
personally
i
give
it
a
4
cuz
its
so
darn
tasty
d
decent
the
alcohol
is
noticeable
but
to
me
the
real
culprit
is
what
the
heck
is
this
beer
trying
to
be
it
has
the
alcohol
of
a
barleywine
or
a
strong
ale
has
a
very
crisp
carbonation
but
the
body
is
a
bit
light
for
a
stout
or
porter
despite
its
identity
crisis
i
still
enjoy
it
i
may
grab
another
bottle
to
age
also
when
it
sits
in
the
glass
for
45
minutes
the
last
few
ounces
go
down
better
than
the
first
so
this
is
probably
better
served
in
the
4555
degree
range
as
an
after
dinner
ale
pours
a
very
dark
brown
almost
black
in
the
glass
nice
light
brown
head
forms
immediately
and
sticks
around
for
a
while
aromas
of
milk
chocolate
bourbon
oak
and
vanilla
on
the
palate
i
get
muddled
versions
of
the
above
mentioned
flavors
mostly
milk
chocolate
and
vanilla
drinkable
but
not
all
that
impressive
alcohol
is
wellintegrated
oak
chips
come
across
strongly
sweet
turns
dry
quickly
little
to
no
aftertaste
an
enjoyable
enough
brew
not
quite
as
rich
or
bourbony
more
woody
than
expected
the
sweetness
fades
to
a
dry
finish
wish
that
taste
lingered
on
more
and
was
fuller
stillinall
a
respectable
strong
dark
ale
with
woodybourbonish
notes
excellent
beer
from
this
brewery
which
hitherto
hadnt
made
any
sort
of
substantial
impact
on
me
im
a
little
more
interested
now
overall
it
is
a
good
effort
for
the
brewery
but
nothing
too
special
go
with
oaked
ab
picked
this
one
up
in

springs
for
reasonable
pricepours

great

at

have
had
many
a

that
are

and
in

way
as
complex
in
tastesolid
job
by
cold

traveled
to

mn
awesome
tourfree
had
the
john

wow
tour
was
with
the
brewmaster
took
us
through
the
whole

amazing

if
you
ever
get
the
chance
its

you
can
hardly
tell
until
its
time
to
leave
which
was
hard
to
do
john
henry
imperial
stout
on
tap
did
i
mention
free
overall
very
interesting
not
really
something
you
could
box
into
a
particular
style
i
would
say
it
is
an
imperial
porter
aged
on
bourbon
nice
attempt
but
could
be
refined
a
bit
more
overall
i
have
to
say
it
was
outstanding
i
was
not
expecting
much
but
was
more
then
happily
suprised
with
the
results
an
outstanding
barrel
aged
beer
this
beer
has
a
lot
of
what
i
like
wood
cask
flavors
dark
malt
high
alcohol
and
a
lot
of
hops
very
rich
sweet
malty
strong
ale
with
aromatic
bourbon
characters
and
a
touch
of
dark
fruity
esters
nice
to
sip
in
front
of
a
fire
place
during
cold
seasons
i
put
away
a
bottle
of
this
brew
in
311
and
opened
it
this
evening
cooled
down
to
just
above
40
the
ale
had
taken
well
to
the
aging
at
over
1
5
years
old
this
ale
is
smooth
flavorful
and
easy
to
take
better
now
after
aging
than
when
first
purchased
this
is
not
my
favorite
even
among
those
cold
spring
makes
but
darn
good
anyway
d
this
is
pretty
drinkable
considering
its
abv
i
wouldve
liked
a
little
more
presence
from
the
bourbon
but
the
subtle
hints
of
vanilla
went
nicely
with
the
malts
i
would
drink
this
again
but
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
d
definitely
taking
my
time
with
this
one
and
not
having
another
really
nice
beer
i
would
call
this
more
of
a
scotch
ale
than
a
strong
ale
but
still
has
to
be
the
best
thing
to
come
out
of
cold
spring
in
a
long
time
or
maybe
even
ever
very
drinkable
i
would
drink
this
again
d
dont
think
i
would
want
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
sitting
though
i
will
say
that
the
9
2
alcohol
is
well
hidden
i
am
totally
taken
aback
by
this
beer
i
was
told
from
a
reliable
source
that
despite
my
prior
misconceptions
this
was
in
fact
a
good
tasting
beer
i
didnt
believe
it
but
figured
for
the
price
tag
it
was
worth
it
im
very
glad
i
gave
it
a
shot
honestly
i
wouldnt
be
surprised
if
this
was
in
my
fridge
a
lot
this
fall
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
considering
the
6
99sixer
sale
pricetag
dthe
best
cold
spinggluek
beer
ever
made
and
well
worth
trying
just
not
up
there
with
the
top
in
the
class
still
this
is
an
enjoyable
beer
to
drink
a
few
tweaks
and
this
could
be
really
good
d
because
of
the
strength
flavor
and
mouth
feel
i
could
see
getting
pretty
messed
up
on
this
pours
a
stout
like
black
color
with
a
small
tan
head
that
settles
to
a
thin
cap
moderate
amount
of
spotty
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
not
that
impressive
looking
but
considering
its
high
abv
it
is
good
has
a
rich
malt
aroma
of
mocha
and
roasted
grains
hints
of
vanilla
and
bourbon
from
the
oak
chips
you
can
definately
sense
the
9
1
abv
before
you
even
taste
this
ale
the
bourbon
charactor
dominates
the
flavor
there
are
hints
of
vanilla
espresso
and
chocolate
great
flavor
up
front
but
it
all
disappears
even
before
the
ale
leaves
my
mouth
very
dry
and
slightly
boozy
medium
body
with
a
chewy
texture
nice
carbonation
that
compliments
the
flavor
i
applaud
cold
spring
for
brewing
this
beer
please
bring
us
some
more
beer
of
this
caliber

somewhat

for

of

overall
i
am
very
fairly
with
this
beer
they
need
to
make
more
beers
like
this
and
less
beers
like
their
normal
offerings
boozey
but
good
for
cold

notes
bbcsd0906dan
dthe
oakiness
seems
a
bit
outofbalance
overwhelming
at
times
to
the
point
of
detracting
from
the
beer
flavors
this
seems
to
be
an
otherwise
welldeveloped
beer
and
a
breath
of
fresh
air
compared
to
some
of
cold
springs
lesscraftoriented
brews
very
attractive
and
drinkable
worth
seeking
out
if
youre
a
stout
fan
or
just
a
fan
of
beers
that
taste
good
picked
up
a
single
at
princeton
liquors
in
maple
grove
mn
poured
a
dark
brown
body
with
a
short
tan
head
based
off
of
reviews
ive
read
this
is
probably
the
best
thing
coming
out
of
cold
springs
its
just
a
mellow
bourbon
ale
that
relies
almost
entirely
on
the
bourbon
and
wood
aging
for
its
character
theres
a
hint
of
dark
malt
in
the
background
but
thats
about
it
it
drinks
without
a
hint
of
alcohol
and
is
thin
enough
for
me
to
suspect
adjunct
sugar
was
used
however
if
youre
looking
for
an
affordable
beer
with
bourbon
character
this
is
it
surprised
to
find
a
beer
like
this
in
this
serving
size
usually
an
expensive
bomber
with
this
style
but
this
came
in
a
ten
or
eleven
dollar
six
pack
would
drink
again
too
bad
i
did
not
bring
more
back
recommended
overall
i
feel
this
is
a
great
beer
but
one
that
i
would
buy
on
sporadic
occasions
i
am
pleased
to
have
tried
it
and
cant
say
any
other
beer
ive
tried
is
comparable
the
carbonation
makes
the
brew
a
bit
fluffy
giving
the
otherwise
thinnish
body
some
girth
the
finish
is
a
little
spikey
on
the
tongue
hops
perhaps
overall
its
ok
drinking
but
i
doubt
ill
buy
this
one
again
this
was
a
new
offering
that
i
scored
at
hitimes
in
costa
mesa
the
color
is
black
coffee
brown
from
the
bottle
with
dark
redbrown
highlights
around
the
edges
it
is
dark
nearly
opaque
brown
in
the
glass
with
a
dark
almost
purple
red
color
when
held
in
front
of
a
light
the
head
is
chocolatey
tan
and
foamy
and
lasts
well
the
smell
is
bready
and
brown
sugary
the
mouthfeel
is
surprisingly
creamyvery
nice
the
taste
is
also
brown
sugar
or
molasses
up
front
though
this
makes
it
sound
very
sweet
its
nothow
do
you
describe
the
nonsweet
aspects
of
brown
sugar
and
molasses
caramel
this
is
a
very
interesting
flavor
its
pretty
complex
its
categorized
as
an
american
strong
ale
it
has
similarities
to
brown
ales
it
isnt
nearly
as
bitter
as
the
other
strong
ales
ive
had
the
beer
is
aged
on
bourbon
oak
chips
the
oak
is
present
though
understated
which
is
fine
by
me
the
bourbon
is
clearly
noticeable
i
would
guess
that
the
wood
contributes
to
the
soft
mouthfeel
this
is
quite
a
nice
beer
flavor
is
bright
and
hoppy
some
citrus
and
pine
mainly
bitterness
and
pale
malts
and
really
no
hint
of
alcohol
flavor
deceptive
good
stuff
oh
boy
weve
got
a
big
one
here
bright
tawny
hue
topped
with
a
tiny
bubbled

malt
mild
fruitiness
in
the
nose
creamy
smooth
almost
cordiallike
boozy
but
not
hot
biscuity
malt
from
start
to
finish
this
is
a
massive
brew
easy
to
sip
but
the
alcohol
gives
a
kick
to
the
palate
letting
me
know
i
should
be
taking
my
time
beer
geek
delight
with
this
one
o
heavy
and
loaded
this
may
be
the
perfect

beer
its
good

i
think
the
double

is
much
more
flavorful

as
you
can
tell
i
really
did
not
enjoy
this
one
o
i
have
waited
patiently
for
this
imperial
german
altbier
to
finally
make
return
after
its
first
release
in
bottles
back
in
2011
and
it
was
well
worth
the
wait
although
similar
in
format
to

brewed
back
in

triple

to
its

and
lack

and
feel

keeps
up

regular
rotation

i
liked
this
beer
i
havent
had
double

so
cant
compare
them
but
this
was
an
enjoyable
beer
for
a
winter
evening
i
did
like
this
beer
at
11
abv
you
could
taste
the
alcohol
i
would
not
drink
this
everyday
but
if
you
can
find
some
pick
it
up
a
single
and
its
well
worth
chocking
it
up
to
the
lift
of
beers
tried
imo
its
boozy
but
at
11
it
to
be
expected
taste
palate
its
flavor
is
full
bodied
and
loaded
with
notes
of
caramel
and
sweet
raisin
bread
there
is
a
pleasant
boozy
warmth
though
out
and
its
finnish
brings
only
a
just
very
slight
earthy
hops
flavor
the
feel
is
full
well
rounded
and
a
bit
slick
but
not
in
a
cloying
way
notes
just
as
a
side
notes
this
beer
was
aged
over
a
year
in
my
beer
cellar
odnigger
is
not
better
double
bag
was
one
of
my
first
intros
to
craft
i
still
enjoy
it
somewhat
this
one
doesnt
have
the
same
magic
as
its
little
brother
overall
eh
this
was
just
okay
to
me
and
certainly
not
something
ill
rush
out
to
try
again
i
havent
had
too
many
altbiers
but
i
certainly
prefer
the
double
bag
to
the
triple
bag
perhaps
it
would
be
a
good
food
beer
maybe
some
sweet
sausages
or
braunschweiger
would
balance
out
the
edges
of
this
ale
yuck
frankly
quite
hard
to
drink
and
high
abv
kicks
you
around
for
your
trouble
not
my
thing
overall
a
touch
boozier
and
sweeter
than
double
bag
but
i
think
i
like
triple
bag
better
o
too
sweet
and
boozy
to
want
another
in
fact
im
not
even
eager
to
finish
my
first
i
generally
prefer
double
bag
o
after
trying
the
double
and
triple
bag
i
can
say
im
not
fond
of
the
style
a
nicely
balanced
sticke
alt
the
9
2
abv
is
barely
perceived
overall
a
little
too
malty
and
the
alcohol
is
definitely
present
i
prefer
their
double

to
this
brew

and
the
beers
head
is
very
lightly
tan
in
color
the
beers
lacing
is
thin
and
slick
leaving
slippery
lines
of
foam
on
my
glass
on
the
nose
this
beer
is
big
and
pungent
from
the
moment
the
cap
is
popped
beautiful
rich
malts
leap
from
the
bottle
the
glass
and
whatever
other
container
you
might
have
this
beer
in
when
you
stick
your
nose
in
the
glass
you
get
sweet
notes
of
brown
sugar
raisin
prune
slight
maple
syrup
notes
and
a
surprising
amount
of
creamy
and
also
unripe
banana
on
the
tongue
this
beer
is
creamy
sweet
bringing
raisins
banana
brown
sugar
caramel
and
slight
toasted
malts
on
to
the
tongue
the
beer
begins
with
sweet
brown
sugar
and
a
touch
of
maple
syrup
before
opening
into
raisins
then
prunes
then
a
touch
of
dates
and
lovely
toasted
caramel
malts
before
the
beer
hits
the
finish
of
banana
raisins
and
brown
sugar
the
aftertaste
is
beautifully
long
lasting
giving
hints
of
both
ripe
and
unripe
banana
and
brown
sugar
on
the
mouth
the
beer
feels
slightly
below
heavy
but
chewy
in
body
and
creamy
smooth
on
the
tongue
the
mouth
is
left
dry
on
the
sides
but
swimming
in
saliva
on
the
middles
of
the
tongue
overall
this
beer
is
fantastic
sweet
and
complex
i
love
how
this
beer
is
specially
made
from
the
first
runnings
of
the
mash
as
that
adds
a
certain
amount
of
fanciness
to
it
i
also
love
how
it
smells
and
how
it
feels
on
the
tongue
and
especially
how
it
tastes
this
is
a
beautiful
sipping
beer
that
is
ripe
with
flavors
and
doesnt
quite
touch
on
the
common
flavor
profiles
of
other
big
beers
this
beer
is
a
winner
try
it
o
overall
the
booziness
takes
over
at
times
and
becomes
distracting
im
not
one
to
shy
away
from
big
boozy
beers
only
when
they
inhibit
most
of
the
flavor
aspects
and
complexity
drinkability
is
limited
average
excitiment
meh
to
be
fair
im
a
huge
fan
of
their
double
bag
which
i
believe
rated
b
and
really
enjoyed
and
think
it
is
a
much
better
tuned
beer
in
terms
of
balance
and
malt
profile
bigger
isnt
always
bigger
in
this
case
overall
not
a
bad
beer
not
great
better
than
double
bag
actually
drink
pretty
good
and
malty
a
bit
thick
and
flavorful
like
i
mentioned
better
for
dessert
overall
not
one
of
my
favorites
but
definitely
worth
a
try
not
as
drinkable
as
the
double
bag
but
expected
for
the
abv
youll
be
feeling
good
after
a
couple
of
these
at
53
ibus
this
is
no
hop
bomb
there
is
a
hearty
suppliment
of
honey
and
malt
to
bring
out
a
smooth
chewiness
all
of
this
to
make
for
a
unique
quaff
at
the
end
of
a
tiresome
day
one
of
these
should
do
it
i
think
double
bag
is
one
of
long
trails
better
offerings
so
i
guess
i
am
predisposed
to
enjoy
this
i
think
it
probably
mellowed
a
bit
in
the
few
months
i
accidentally
let
this
age
i
will
be
drinking
this
again
pours
a
four
finger
khaki
head
that
fades
slowly
to
thin
layer
leaving
some
lace
hazy
amber
color
light
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
malty
caramel
nose
flavor
is
similar
malty
caramel
with
hops
balancing
expecting
more
flavor
more
body
than
the
double
bag
11
95
for
a
4pak
of
12oz
bottles
from
berts
better
beers
hooksett
nh
overall
a
great
beer
one
of
the
best
of
this
style
ive
had
its
really
a
very
simple
big
slow
sipping
barleywinedouble
double
bock
quadruple
bock
i
like
it
a
lot
not
the
session
beer
that
double
bag
is
but
a
really
nice
almost
english
style
barleywine
ill
have
another
please
overall
this
is
a
hearty
and
maltfocused
beer
this
is
a
meal
and
the
flavor
is
well
balanced
enjoyable
but
slow
sipping
o
nice
beer
one
i
go
to
frequently
when
i
want
a
nice
malty
beer
without
too
much
bitterness
not
that
often
but
it
happens
overall
i
would
say
this
is
a
very
good
beer
i
like
long
trail
as
a
brewery
and
find
most
of
their
beers
consistently
good
i
would
purchase
this
again
o
i
had
heard
good
things
of
double
bag
so
i
didnt
think
twice
when
i
saw
triple
bag
for
growler
fills
im
a
bit
disappointed
honestly
the
abv
is
quite
honestly
the
only
reason
i
could
understand
drinking
this
one
theres
not
much
there
in
flavors
smell
or
even
the
pour
maybe
this
is
better
with
aging
i
would
probably
pick
up
a
bottle
to
store
for
year
or
so
but
never
again
in
growlertap
as
i
pour
triple
bag
into
my
mug
it
appears
oily
deep
and
dark
burnt
sienna
an
initial
12
inch
head
of
carbonation
is
present
but
quickly
disappears
almost
completely
the
nose
is
very
sweet
and
extremely
malty
with
plum
and
spice
notes
surprisingly
the
body
of
the
beer
is
fairly
light
flavorwise
i
am
picking
up
bakers
chocolate
caramel
and
a
tiny
bit
of
resiny
hops
along
with
some
other
sort
of
earthiness
for
a
very
dry
finish
towards
the
finish
there
is
an
intense
warming
sensation
cant
have
too
many
of
these
in
one
night
overall
this
is
one
of
the
better
beers
i
have
had
from
long
trail
really
a
one
and
done
kind
of
thing
and
no
way
is
available
to
me
locally
still
as
good
as
expected
if
not
better
overall
nice
well
rounded
beer
with
some
uniqueness
but
still
keeping
true
to
the
strong
ale
roots
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
thin
patchy
cocoa
head
minimal
lacing
on
the
side
of
my
snifter
glass
the
smell
seems
a
little
watered
down
for
the
style
cinnamon
nutmeg
spice
alcohol
and
malt
very
sweet
smelling
and
not
enough
meat
in
the
smell
taste
is
the
same
just
not
a
lot
happening
compared
to
the
best
in
style
the
taste
is
very
nutty
and
almost
tastes
like
a
spiked
iced
tea
hmmm
feel
is
medium
with
below
average
carbonation
and
a
alcohol
heat
aftertaste
the
whole
beer
just
seems
a
little
off
overall
this
is
a
fairly
mediocre
example
of
the
style
ill
probably
not
look
for
this
again
cheers

poured

with

inch

white
head
that
hangs
around
awhile
and
laces
the

out

brown

carmel
taste
is
that
more
enjoyable
then
smell
with
a
hint
of
booze
and
hard
candy
in
the
finish
body
isnt
that
big
considering
the
hefty
abv
that
helps
with
its
drinkability
good
amount
of
life
and
isnt
dry
this
is
nice
and
a
different
beer
malt
lovers
should
love
this
but
has
enough
hop
presence
to
satisfy
a
hop
head
overallim
definitely
getting
a
kind
of
american
scotch
ale
vibe
here
alcohol
comes
through
more
in
the
nose
than
in
taste
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
for
a
chilly
late
fall
night
great
for
nursing
and
mulling
over
the
day
by
the
fire
unique
and
highly
recommended
o
the
beer
has
a
good
aroma
and
taste
but
it
feels
a
bit
syrupy
which
diminishes
its
drinkability
and
makes
it
more
of
a
beer
that
needs
to
be
sipped
i
was
super
surprised
with
this
one
it
doesnt
have
th
ebest
reviews
here
on
ba
but
it
was
delicious
slightly
over
malty
but
otherwise
nice
strong
fruity
overtones
with
just
the
right
amount
of
alcohol
it
tastes
more
like
a
tripel
to
me
as
the
name
may
suggest
overall
well
worth
trying
and
hopefully
you
will
be
as
surprised
as
me
really
liked
this
one
heavy
on
the
malt
as
you
would
expect
from
a
strong
ale
very
reminiscent
of
the
double
bastard
lots
of
alcohol
in
the
nose
and
palate
definitely
a
sipping
beer
as
the
abv
would
suggest
lots
of
malt
but
lacks
the
lingering
taste
i
guess
this
is
where
the
hops
should
come
in
but
none
present
still
a
great
beer
and
worth
a
try
if
you
enjoy
the
double
bag
thank
you
long
trail
i
was
skeptical
at
first
when
even
purchasing
the
beer
but
glad
i
gave
it
a
try
what
a
monster
of
an
ale
really
rich
but
creamy
smooth
great
night
cap
for
those
of
us
who
like
malt
bombs
also
this
follows
nicely
after
a
glass
of
double
bag
a
real
hard
task
to
follow
12oz
bottle
with
a
bottled
on
date
of
i
think
092811
pours
a
muddy
mahogany
color
with
no
head
some
lacing
aroma
is
pretty
boozey
and
malty
some
dark
fruits
smells
somewhat
like
the
higher
abv
dfh
beers
olde
school
wws
etc
taste
is
earthy
malty
and
boozey
again
i
got
to
say
this
tastes
alot
like
the
cousin
of
the
higher
octane
dfh
beers
dark
fruits
and
some
sweetness
as
well
as
some
spices
more
bitter
towards
the
end
the
9
2
abv
is
very
present
this
is
a
very
interesting
beer
and
a
great
cold
weather
sipper
overall
i
want
to
have
this
again
poured
a
nice
deep
amber
just
a
bit
to
opaque
to
see
anything
through
the
beer
slightly
rich
and
sweet
aroma
things
change
in
the
taste
all
i
get
is
malt
and
almost
sickeningly
sweet
malt
at
that
which
finishes
with
a
slightly
bittersweet
note
the
whole
beer
lasts
a
lot
longer
on
the
tongue
than
youd
expect
oone
of
long
trails
best
offerings
glad
i
picked
up
a
bottle
once
again
it
is
very
malty
pours
from
the
12
oz
bottle
a
coppery
brown
with
a
creamy
one
finger
head
that
quickly
dissolves
into
a
medium
lacing
carbonation
is
light
aroma
is
heavy
with
sweetness
apples
peaches
strawberries
honey
1st
sip
brings
all
that
sweet
aroma
to
the
tongue
in
a
very
pleasant
noncloying
way
mouthfeel
is
silky
and
creamy
and
there
is
a
hint
of
alcohol
on
the
swallow
but
its
very
subtle
this
goes
down
a
little
too
smoothly
for
a
9
25
abv
ale
overall
this
is
a
very
good
strong
ale
one
id
love
to
see
go
from
limited
release
to
long
trails
regular
lineup
wish
i
could
describe
how
wonderful
this
feels
and
tastes
do
not
drink
below
45
degrees
very
dark
very
rich
heavy
full
almost
like
a
mouthful
of
warm
brown
bread
picked
up
two
four
packs
from
the
brewery
last
month
would
have
bought
more
but
for
the
worth
every
penny
just
wish
i
had
more
pennies
wow
was
this
a
fun
beer
congrats
to
long
trail
on
this
one
im
usually
not
a
fan
of
malt
bombs
but
this
one
did
me
right
rich
caramel
toffee
molasses
burnt
sugar
all
tickling
my
mouth
the
heat
is
there
but
does
not
interfere
like
some
malt
forward
beers
of
this
abv
do
a
real
pleasure
from
a
bottle
stamped
3094092211
sampled
on
november
17
2011
it
has
a
nice
looking
average
dark
amber
pour
with
a
head
that
dissolves
in
short
order
on
the
nose
there
is
a
solid
malt
character
as
well
as
something
like
apple
or
pear
the
body
falls
into
the
medium
range
malts
are
definitely
a
key
element
to
the
taste
but
not
quite
as
malty
as
a
barleywine
it
has
a
sour
hopped
ending
that
is
also
a
tad
dry
this
is
a
nice
deviation
for
long
trail
o
if
youre
at
the
less
popular
end
of
the
beerspectrum
opposite
the
hopheads
and
looking
for
a
maltbomb
this
beer
will
be
a
rare
treat
this
is
probably
the
maltly
equivalent
of
the
hopbomb
hop
stoopid
by
lagunitas
this
beer
has
tons
of
flavor
and
alcohol
that
will
satisfy
all
wantsneeds
of
someone
looking
for
a
sweeter
oneanddone
beer
o
glad
i
got
to
try
this
as
its
never
been
on
tap
each
time
weve
made
the
trek
up
there
but
i
dont
think
id
ever
search
it
out
again
not
saying
its
a
bad
beer
its
still
very
good
but
unless
its
where
ever
i
am
most
likely
wont
look
for
it
overall
i
love
this
beer
its
a
belgian
strong
dark
minus
yeast
funk
plus
an
abundant
hop
bittering
perfect
for
an
evening
after
a
cold
and
lousy
opening
day
of
rifle
season
a
fine
slow
sipper
im
looking
forward
to
quadrupel
and
quintuple
bag
was
surprised
to
even
see
this
at
my
local
store
so
bought
a
4
pack
of
it
for
about
10
love
the
double
bag
so
was
excited
to
see
the
triple
bag
it
definitely
does
not
disappoint
nice
caramel
and
sweet
aroma
very
unique
style
beer
with
really
no
category
a
bit
strong
but
thats
to
be
expected
great
mouthfeel
and
is
super
balanced
and
finishes
nice
and
smooth
a
delight
to
drink
great
beer
overall
i
like
drinking
this
as
a
winter
warmer
in
my
opinion
it
is
more
fitting
than
their
hibernation
ale
yet
both
are
good
but
this
is
better
good
job
again
long
trail
overall
not
bad
a
bit
too
heavy
for
its
own
good
but
decent
with
nice
malts
and
sweeteners
the
hops
are
interesting
but
a
bit
much
and
sticky
syrupy
malt
flavors
a
bit
too
much
then
again
as
its
supposed
to
be
much
bigger
than
double
bag
i
think
they
pretty
much
achieved
that
a
big
robust
beer
cheers
thanks
bendurgin
for
the
opportunity
overall
its
nice
but
i
think
i
prefer
the
double
bag
o
this
will
be
on
heavy
rotation
as
long
as
i
can
find
it
great
beer
at
a
great
price
you
can
never
go
wrong
with
double
bag
or
triple
bag
o
an
extremely
complex
and
unique
brew
but
every
sip
is
kind
of
all
over
the
place
decent
but
thick
and
heavy
d
this
is
a
really
nice
strong
ale
not
overly
complex
and
not
overly
sweet
with
a
nice
balance
between
the
sweetness
and
subtle
spiciness
and
earthiness
goes
down
very
easy
despite
the
booze
content
a
nice
extra
that
im
glad
i
got
to
try
an
interesting
beer
a
soupedup
double
bag
with
a
deceiving
9
4
abv
a
nice
sipper
beer
for
the
upcoming
cooler
fall
and
winter
months
o
enjoyable
i
will
be
working
this
in
to
the
rotation
i
love
a
good
strong
ale
perfect
for
the
winter
months
one
of
my
favorite
offerings
from
lt
i
still
gotta
hate
on
the
packaging
though
saving
two
bottles
for
some
cellar
time
a
nice
drinkable
strong
ale
around
the
10month
mark
it
has
as
much
bite
as
it
did
fresh
less
sure
that
i
want
to
hang
onto
the
rest
if
theyre
taking
up
cellar
space
still
smells
amazing
still
great
tasting
just
a
bit
more
hops
than
i
like
kinda
american
barleywine
very
good
seek
it
out
o
this
beer
is
delicious
its
quite
mellow
for
the
9
4
abv
yes
there
is
a
kick
but
it
doesnt
turn
you
away
i
got
this
bottle
as
a
small
gift
from
a
good
friend
but
i
have
seen
it
for
about
2
or
3
dollars
at
a
local
beer
store
i
would
definitely
buy
this
again
and
i
will
sometimes
its
nice
to
have
a
great
brew
that
you
dont
really
have
to
analyze
that
much
overall
as
of
this
date
i
would
say
try
the
long
trail
harvest
seasonal
beer
its
phenomenal
this
is
somewhat
forgettable
i
am
enjoying
it
but
its
just
a
strong
dark
nut
brown
stout
peculiar
beer
leaves
me
wanting
more
to
pinpoint
it
its
rather
expensive
because
i
think
its
a
limited
release
beer
but
if
you
have
the
extra
cash
check
it
out
cheers
a
slow
sipper
but
not
as
complex
as
a
slow
sipper
should
be
the
aroma
is
quite
good
but
it
ends
up
being
boozy
and
malty
and
thats
about
it
pours
a
clear
deep
brown
color
with
a
smallish
tan
head
that
recedes
quickly
smells
of
caramel
and
cherries
mostly
with
hints
of
prunes
and
alcohol
thrown
in
for
good
measure
sweet
fruity
syrupy
flavor
lots
of
caramel
and
dark
fruits
with
a
bit
of
alcohol
burn
sweet
sticky
mouthfeel
low
to
moderate
level
of
carbonation
with
a
medium
to
thick
body
decent
brew
that
i
enjoyed
sipping
for
a
couple
of
hours
but
a
touch
to
high
with
the
alcohol
burn
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
it
has
all
the
great
flavors
of
the
original
double
bag
but
its
taken
to
a
new
level
with
the
darker
fruity
flavors
that
are
absent
from
the
original
i
imagine
they
are
adding
a
darker
lovibond
caramel
malt
here
that
adds
that
nice
dark
caramel
and
dark
fruit
flavors
which
really
add
to
the
complexity
and
overall
flavor
profile
in
this
beer
almost
smells
and
tastes
like
a
belgian
dubbel
because
of
the
dominant
plum
and
fig
aromas
and
flavors
present
here
a
great
job
by
a
great
brewery
that
is
always
underrated
despite
delivering
amazing
quality
for
amazing
value
an
extreme
altbier
it
tastes
more
like
a
barleywine
to
me
regardless
worth
a
try
12oz
bottle
served
in
my
maudite
tulip
pours
a
deep
brown
not
quite
the
color
of
cola
with
a
one
inch
loose
creamcolored
head
that
quickly
dissipates
into
a
rolling
sudsy
froth
that
coalesces
around
the
edges
a
half
moon
swath
of
delicate
lacing
encircles
the
bowl
nose
expresses
dark
malts
and
dark
fruits
aromas
are
somewhat
akin
to
an
americanized
belgian
strong
dark
taste
follows
nose
however
theres
also
an
interesting
bubblegum
quality
maybe
grape
as
well
as
a
faint
yeast
presence
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
with
an
even
carbonation
that
falls
short
of
lively
ive
been
looking
forward
to
trying
this
for
a
while
and
i
have
to
say
that
im
pretty
pleased
with
this
beer
definitely
the
best
brew
ive
had
from
long
trail
and
i
hope
to
see
this
added
to
their
line
as
a
seasonal
rotation
i
definitely
plan
on
picking
up
some
more
to
lay
down
for
a
couple
years
its
a
good
beer
that
i
will
continue
to
enjoy
im
very
curious
to
see
how
this
will
age
and
wonder
if
anyone
at
lt
has
tried
with
previous
years
kegs
overall
this
beer
is
truly
a
great
beer
that
i
think
long
trail
should
add
to
their
list
of
great
ales
they
sell
in
stores
thick
mouthfeel
but
smooth
and
creamy
in
texture
overall
im
digging
this
strong
ale
from
long
trail
lots
of
malty
and
boozy
goodness
with
just
enough
hops
to
keep
things
in
line
dont
let
the
score
i
gave
fool
you
it
was
good
but
i
just
cant
see
myself
having
more
than
one
at
a
time
give
this
one
a
try
i
was
glad
i
did
and
looking
forward
to
the
other
3
that
came
in
the
4
pack
the
body
is
full
and
the
carbonation
is
a
bit
soft
overall
not
bad
here
not
really
sure
what
to
ultimately
make
of
this
but
its
pretty
tasty
md
lively
on
the
tongue
but
not
effervescent
mellow
and
complex
and
layered
looked
forward
to
this
one
for
sometime
and
it
didnt
disappoint
taste
is
sharp
boozy
and
lots
of
dark
fruit
and
sweet
creamy
flavors
mouthfeel
is
full
and
thick
its
pretty
decent
fuller
medium
body
decent
carbonation
sticky
and
lingering
on
the
tongue
drinks
decently
although
this
was
a
bit
warm
and
sweet
for
my
personal
tastes
being
an
appreciator
of
double
bag
over
the
years
im
glad
to
be
able
to
give
this
one
a
try
after
missing
its
limited
appearance
last
year
drinkability
alright
not
great
booze
is
everpresent
and
those
malts
and
sugars
are
overwhelming
im
not
a
big
fan
of
this
one
and
long
trail
in
general
but
it
is
worth
at
least
trying
it
once
i
will
be
sipping
this
fine
aged
ale
that
is
for
sure
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
good
kick
its
not
much
stronger
than
double
bag
but
its
a
lot
sweeter
overall
its
a
good
beer
to
drink
for
while
d
was
quite
easy
to
put
down
it
is
1
higher
in
abv
than
its
sibling
double
bag
which
i
prefer
to
this
but
it
is
actually
easier
to
put
down
both
are
enjoyable
and
glad
i
tried
it
while
its
around
d
not
a
bad
beer
but
its
not
something
i
would
have
more
than
one
of
i
think
i
definitely
prefer
the
double
bag
over
this
one
good
sipping
beer
very
sweet
wouldnt
have
more
than
one
decent
beer
though
draft
at
the
brewery
back
in
november
of
2008
i
decided
to
try
it
based
on
its
limit
brewing
despite
the
fact
that
i
prefer
hops
to
malt
clear
burnt
orange
pour
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
an
abundance
of
malty
sweetness
taste
is
similar
with
a
european
hop
finish
off
the
tap
at
the
scuffer
thanks
mike
mike
this
brew
was
a
dark
ambercopper
color
with
an
offwhite
head
the
retention
was
not
very
impressive
but
the
lacing
was
adequate
the
aroma
was
sweet
and
spoke
to
me
of
rich
malt
green
apples
and
some
sourness
and
vinegar
the
flavors
were
of
caramel
malt
toffee
ripe
fruit
and
fruity
alcohol
esters
with
a
slightly
bitter
and
hopfilled
finish
though
pleasant
enough
i
continued
to
feel
they
missed
the
mark
for
the
style
the
mouthfeel
was
nice
and
the
softer
carbonation
helped
the
beer
be
quaffable
but
the
double
bag
was
still
better
in
my
opinion
this
is
a
good
one
light
enough
to
enjoy
hearty
enough
to
keep
warm
or
as
ron
hawkins
amp
used
to
say
clean
enough
to
be
healthy
dirty
enough
to
be
happy
d
a
nice
mouthfeel
and
taste
combination
a
pretty
good
easy
drinking
beer
that
was
pretty
good
overall
and
definitely
worth
a
go
if
you
have
the
chance
fairly
syrupy
and
thick
body
created
a
bog
mouth
feel
one
to
be
savored
and
certainly
not
a
session
beer
i
found
it
quite
drinkable
and
enjoyed
this
beer
not
bad
a
strong
ale
indeed
and
id
be
willing
to
revisit
it
i
think
the
flavors
were
still
pretty
raw
but
liquor
drinkers
would
probably
relish
in
the
wooded
smokey
nut
and
fruit
flavors
of
this
strong
sweet
concoction
worth
a
try
but
keep
your
expectations
in
check
draught
this
one
pours
a
somewhat
ruby
tinged
mahogany
there
was
almost
no
head
and
lacing
i
was
not
quite
sure
what
to
make
of
the
aroma
there
was
a
sweetness
to
it
but
it
lacked
any
kind
of
caramel
toffee
of
fruits
that
you
might
expect
with
a
beer
like
this
it
smelled
a
bit
astringent
there
was
not
a
lot
of
sweetness
to
the
taste
in
fact
it
had
a
very
dry
finish
a
bit
of
alcohol
to
the
taste
maybe
some
fruits
and
caramel
maybe
a
bit
woody
i
do
not
think
i
will
be
drinking
this
one
again
it
just
was
not
that
good
this
was
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
for
the
abv
a
good
winter
beer
id
say
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
spritzy
up
front
with
toffee
and
sourdough
battling
along
the
palate
leading
to
a
chewy
finish
1094
overall
one
of
the
strangest
beers
i
can
remember
trying
very
spices
and
sweet
with
a
flavor
that
is
really
hard
to
nail
down
still
a
solid
choice
and
i
would
not
shy
away
from
it
again
good
cold
weather
sipping
beer
preferably
in
front
of
a
fire
perhaps
with
a
dark
cigar
had
on
tap
at
union
brewhouse
poured
into
a
10oz
pint
glass
a
dark
ruby
color
with
a
thin
white
head
that
dissapates
quickly
aromas
of
sweet
malt
and
some
sweet
dark
fruits
and
candy
maybe
some
oak
or
booze
as
well
tastes
similar
very
sweet
with
a
hint
of
alcohol
towards
the
end
great
sipping
beer
for
a
xold
night
and
very
drinkable
despite
the
higher
abv
slick
mouthfeel
with
little
carbonation
pretty
good
but
nothing
amazing
d
decently
drinkable
but
a
bit
boozy
drinkability
not
really
a
session
beer
but
not
a
sipper
either
this
brew
is
alright
not
stellar
just
average
a
very
tasty
american
strong
ale
d
as
recommended
and
i
expected
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
in
many
respects
triplebag
goes
to
show
you
american
brewers
can
come
up
with
some
wonderful
creations
while
following
our
elder
brothers
in
the
brewmaking
process
this
is
a
strong
beer
and
one
to
be
drawn
out
to
release
the
library
of
flavors
look
forward
to
picking
up
a
growler
of
this
and
sipping
with
the
wife
by
the
fire
this
winter
mddefinitely
a
sippin
beer
as
the
mouthfeel
is
more
or
less
like
trying
to
hold
a
water
balloon
in
your
mouth
had
to
review
this
from
notes
because
i
couldnt
read
words
off
the
computer
screen
after
two
pints
8
2
bull
corni
think
this
is
closer
to
9
or
10
but
i
aint
got
no
proof
of
that
also
and
last
the
fella
at
bierkraft
in
brooklyn
told
me
this
was
a
doppelsticke
but
whatever
dunno
if
ba
even
has
that
as
an
option
long
trail
triple
bag
what
a
crazy
name
for
a
brew
this
is
a
highly
malty
version
of
the
double
bag
pours
a
copper
colourleaving
light
lacing
mild
nose
just
a
better
than
average
american
ale
at
8
2
abv
not
a
brew
to
quench
the
thirst
but
to
appreciate
the
great
flavours
of
this
not
so
hoppy
ale
