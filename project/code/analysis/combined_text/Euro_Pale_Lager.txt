easy
and
refreshing
better
than
peroni
in
my
opinion
just
another
run
of
the
mill
pale
lager
drinkable
taste
ok
but
for
me
yawn
a
crisp
pale
lager
that
has
a
crisp
clean
and
refreshing
taste
smooth
a
touch
of
hop
herbal
in
the
finish
no
real
bitterness
light
flavored
alright
tasting
colors
lightbudlight
had
a
bottle
in
tampa
at
dinner
was
ok
it
has
an
ok
taste
good
coloring
i
like
this
italian
lager
pretending
to
justify
my
rating
good
when
its
very
cold
as
it
warms
up
it
starts
to
taste
bad
just
like
your
average
lager
worth
a
try
but
i
wasnt
feeling
this
beer
at
all
here
is
a
lager
that
kind
of
surprised
me
the
golden
color
is
nice
the
taste
is
a
little
on
the
bitter
side
for
me
which
is
why
i
gave
it
a
lower
score
worth
the
try
in
my
opinion
yeasty
and
overly
carbonated
way
too
watery
as
well
tastes
just
like
miller
lite
overall
for
me
this
was
a
bit
of
a
diamond
in
the
rough
i
had
euro
pale
lager
night
which
i
was
not
looking
forward
to
since
it
is
really
not
my
favourite
style
after
a
bunch
of
average
beers
and
a
bunch
of
awful
beers
this
one
actually
comes
across
quite
refreshing
with
a
subtle
and
quality
flavour
profile
impressive
for
au42
a
case
ill
have
it
again
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
a
balanced
and
smooth
taste
that
goes
down
well
moretti
is
a
good
lager
that
goes
especially
well
with
italian
food
naturally
birra
moretti
brewed
by
birra
moretti
heineken
with
an
abv
of
4
60
this
brew
pours
out
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
nice
white
head
birra
moretti
is
an
filtered
brew
you
can
see
right
though
it
the
smell
nice
with
grains
and
malts
you
also
pick
up
on
some
sweetness
in
the
smell
of
this
brew
now
for
the
taste
it
is
rich
with
with
malts
and
a
mild
sweetness
this
brew
has
a
nice
balance
it
it
there
is
nothing
overpowering
in
this
brew
the
mouthfeel
is
is
nice
and
clean
this
brew
is
also
relishing
birra
moretti
did
a
nice
job
with
this
one
over
all
im
giving
birra
moretti
a
4
75
out
of
5
i
would
buy
this
brew
again
i
only
drink
it
cause
its
made
in
italy
which
doesnt
mean
high
quality
just
that
its
my
heritage
otherwise
it
would
be
just
a
light
lager
with
limited
complexity
cold
is
best
just
like
italys
other
big
beermaker
peroni
this
product
is
merely
ok
if
you
go
to
italy
dont
bother
drinking
beer
have
wine
instead
overall
this
is
just
okay
for
me
italian
beers
dont
get
a
lot
of
love
pretty
much
for
a
good
reason
o
looked
like
apale
euro
lager
but
tasted
more
like
a
vienna
style
lager
great
tasting
euro
pils
medium
bodied
tons
of
biscuity
malt
flavor
followed
by
a
refreshing
hop
bitterness
really
hard
to
beat
imo
kicks
all
others
in
the
heinie
the
most
desired
beer
in
italy
overall
there
is
nothing
really
wrong
with
this
but
nothing
really
good
about
it
either
it
is
just
dull
having
said
that
if
you
drink
it
with
an
italian
meal
it
does
have
a
better
flavour
following
the
meal
but
not
nearly
enough
to
make
it
interesting
so
my
advice
is
either
drink
this
as
your
accompaniment
to
an
italian
meal
or
treat
it
like
a
miller
chill
it
to
near
zero
and
drink
it
quick
so
you
dont
notice
the
lack
of
flavour
i
also
tend
to
feel
that
this
last
point
makes
this
a
worrying
beer
what
i
mean
by
that
is
best
explained
by
this
imagine
if
a
bunch
of
rowdy
teens
get
their
hands
on
this
at
4
6
they
would
be
pissed
pretty
quickly
and
would
just
keep
on
drinking
as
there
is
so
little
flavour
it
would
taste
like
water
even
to
them
overall
light
crisp
refreshing
and
ordinary
tasty
strong
for
abv
nice
bitekick
does
the
job
an
enjoyable
evening
lager
a
good
lager
since
moretti
is
part
of
heineken
i
was
expecting
some
skunk
this
lager
however
was
free
of
any
sulfur
taste
and
was
very
crisp
and
clean
actually
quite
enjoyable
this
beer
is
a
munich
helles
style
clean
rich
malty
pours
perfectly
golden
clear
and
maintains
a
slight
head
for
the
duration
malty
nose
and
slight
sweetness
comes
through
not
for
the
hopaholics
who
knew
that
the
italians
could
brew
such
a
clean
bavarian
brew
despite
the
poor
ratings
and
reviews
i
think
this
a
solid
drinker
overall
nothing
mind
blowing
but
certainly
would
not
turn
one
of
these
down
at
an
italian
restaurant
or
similar
setting
with
limit
options
you
can
certainly
do
much
worse
wow
a
whole
330ml
ill
be
done
before
i
really
get
started
i
got
started
with
my
usual
heavyhanded
pour
resulting
in
a
pseudocascade
and
producing
just
under
three
fingers
of
dense
rocky
bonewhite
head
with
good
retention
color
was
a
pale
lemonyellow
srm
2
4
with
nequality
clarity
for
the
second
time
today
i
feel
like
i
have
passed
urine
that
was
darker
than
the
beer
in
my
glass
nose
had
a
grassy
saaz
hopslike
aroma
no
adjuncts
anyway
mouthfeel
was
thintomedium
taste
was
mildly
grassy
with
a
biscuit
malt
backbone
not
bad
especially
for
the
price
point
finish
was
semidry
rather
unobtrusive
and
fairly
pleasant
in
total
very
skunky
aroma
but
pleasant
to
drink
it
has
a
very
refreshing
taste
think
heineken
but
a
little
stronger
nice
clear
golden
color
with
a
frothy
head
aftertaste
is
a
little
dry
low
carbonation
all
in
all
its
a
beer
that
you
could
definitely
sit
down
and
watch
a
game
with
although
nothing
to
write
home
about
its
cheap
and
easy
enjoy
overall
an
excellent
euro
style
pale
lager
really
enjoyed
this
one
poured
from
a
50cl
can
into
a
pilsner
glass
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
at
pizzeria
in
calgary
a
light
golden
amber
brew
with
maybe
a
halfinch
of
large
white
bubbles
a
shade
darker
than
many
other
euro
pales
and
featuring
less
doughy
sweetness
as
well
smells
like
grain
husks
and
faint
grassy
hops
less
doughy
and
more
malty
than
its
sweeter
yet
crisper
and
fruitier
countryman
peroni
this
one
is
dry
as
well
but
features
a
more
rounded
tannic
maltiness
somewhat
like
weakly
steeped
tea
vague
lemon
rind
some
dms
but
less
than
expected
dry
stale
popcorn
and
a
metallic
tingle
in
the
dry
grassy
finish
thin
and
super
fizzy
but
maybe
just
a
hair
thicker
than
something
like
heineken
i
did
note
that
the
spicy
sauce
on
my
pizza
brought
out
some
added
dry
grape
and
pale
malt
character
good
example
of
a
food
pairing
that
raises
up
the
beer
half
of
the
partnership
i
am
surprised
at
the
head
retention
the
color
is
alright
very
light
and
can
almost
see
exactly
whats
behind
it
so
almost
translusant
the
hes
only
poured
to
about
a
quarter
of
an
inch
but
stayed
that
way
all
throughout
the
drinking
you
cant
see
through
the
head
and
its
almost
silky
this
is
probably
the
only
thing
that
makes
this
beer
different
from
other
the
taste
is
okay
nothing
to
really
discribe
hoppy
at
the
end
more
refreshing
than
anything
overall
an
okay
beer
a
respectable
lager
light
and
delicate
overall
the
appearance
is
its
high
point
the
flavor
is
fairly
nondescript
and
doesnt
stand
out
in
any
way
easy
drinking
and
does
wet
ones
whistle
poor
or
close
to
it
stale
flavors
not
to
be
revisited
might
as
well
drink
a
coors
light
overall
a
very
poor
euro
pale
lager
has
none
of
the
malty
sweetish
note
expected
of
this
style
taste
like
a
poorly
brewed
domestic
beer
taste
it
is
light
and
creamy
like
a
cream
ale
style
with
a
cereal
grain
flavor
and
a
honey
after
taste
there
is
very
little
hoppiness
with
a
hint
of
grassy
and
citrus
notes
this
can
be
a
decent
session
lager
pours
to
a
thin
white
head
that
falls
to
thin
ring
with
little
retention
color
is
pale
gold
aroma
is
spicy
hops
and
sweet
grains
pleasant
and
balanceddoesnt
smell
cheap
or
skunky
good
hop
flavor
that
has
a
spiciness
suggesting
regional
hops
of
the
saaz
variety
finishes
dry
and
crisp
mouthfeel
is
light
and
clean
moderate
co2
the
only
beer
i
will
drink
with
certain
italian
dishes
it
has
a
light
delicate
flavor
that
works
in
places
where
a
white
wine
would
normally
go
in
food
pairings
the
perceived
quality
of
a
beer
needs
to
be
considered
in
the
context
of
what
it
is
intended
to
deliver
moretti
is
not
trying
to
be
an
english
ale
or
an
american
west
coast
ipa
moretti
is
light
in
color
mouth
feel
and
flavor
with
a
bit
of
a
german
lager
and
hoppy
goodness
on
swallow
fairly
low
ipa
too
but
dont
compare
it
to
the
best
of
other
styles
moretti
is
a
good
lager
that
goes
especially
well
with
italian
food
dont
believe
me
try
it
with
a
plate
of
lasagna
and
salad
or
a
thin
crust
pizza
no
other
beer
is
a
better
food
pairing
o
unimaginative
bland
run
of
the
mill
dead
you
be
the
judge
i
would
even
go
for
a
miller
light
before
this
very
surprised
that
an
import
of
this
cost
could
be
so
depressing
on
the
palate
final
grade
3
42
a
respectable
b
i
had
low
expectations
coming
into
this
review
but
birra
moretti
is
actually
a
fine
lager
a
damn
fine
one
in
my
humble
opinion
and
a
surprisingly
solid
choice
for
my
450th
review
normally
these
euro
lagers
are
a
oneanddone
for
me
but
this
is
one
i
could
actually
see
myself
purchasing
again
and
id
certainly
pick
it
over
peroni
or
90
of
the
other
imported
lagers
that
crowd
the
shelves
around
here
a
justifiable
option
at
its
lcbo
price
point
if
youre
a
lager
fan
looking
for
something
simple
to
quaff
on
a
hot
day
give
this
one
a
shot
to
the
point
a
good
lager
as
far
as
lagers
go
12
bucks
for
a
six
pack
i
know
i
can
find
a
better
beer
for
this
kind
of
money
and
not
be
stuck
with
some
typical
lager
beer
factoring
in
the
price
ill
have
to
give
it
an
okay
o
typical
euro
lager
decent
for
an
adjunct
lager
good
choice
of
hops
with
a
fair
quantity
for
the
style
but
it
has
a
low
cost
benefit
in
brazil
should
cost
less
than
a
heineken
which
has
a
superior
taste
taste
of
light
cereal
malt
thin
bodied
with
a
light
flavor
and
a
corn
flakecereal
finish
utterly
forgettable
and
just
as
bland
from
the
source
italy
as
imported
o
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
although
its
not
very
interesting
the
taste
is
rather
good
when
compared
to
other
beers
in
the
style
it
would
have
been
a
lot
nicer
if
it
didnt
have
the
skunky
aromas
and
flavors
gotta
love
watching
peter
otoole
as
pope
paul
iii
whilst
drinking
this
seemingly
italian
beer
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
brassstraw
topped
by
a
finger
of
lightly
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
funky
corn
funky
wheat
light
flowers
and
a
light
layer
of
dust
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
along
with
an
unfortunate
extra
bit
of
dust
and
dirt
hm
the
body
is
a
hefty
light
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
wet
fluid
feel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
weak
bit
of
beer
something
id
hope
the
burgeoning
italian
scene
is
quick
to
rebuke
i
can
not
wait
to
head
back
to
disney
in
june
and
eat
the
great
pizza
at
via
napoli
and
drink
several
moretti
beers
next
time
i
head
to
the
beer
store
i
will
be
picking
up
some
bottles
of
these
as
i
just
found
out
they
are
in
stock
i
havent
been
missing
out
on
this
beer
before
now
one
of
the
more
available
italian
beers
this
one
is
pretty
much
the
pale
euro
standard
nothing
special
it
pours
a
really
faded
straw
looking
color
with
a
rapidly
rising
white
head
aided
by
the
pilsner
glass
im
using
here
the
color
is
really
pale
too
light
even
for
the
style
it
lets
me
know
not
to
expect
too
much
taste
here
the
nose
also
gives
that
indication
with
just
a
crystal
light
malt
grassy
sort
of
nose
a
little
skunky
without
any
more
than
basic
bittering
hops
in
the
finish
the
flavor
is
identical
to
the
nose
i
mean
this
is
plenty
drinkable
in
fact
its
really
easy
down
but
there
just
isnt
much
taste
not
a
lot
of
off
flavors
as
the
skunk
has
subsided
but
its
a
pretty
watered
down
beer
still
there
is
something
unique
about
moretti
i
dont
know
if
its
the
yeast
or
the
grains
or
what
but
i
can
always
pick
this
beer
out
blind
with
other
similar
ones
because
it
has
a
sort
of
burnt
bread
element
that
stands
out
not
much
else
going
on
the
feel
isnt
bad
just
really
light
and
lacking
on
alcohol
as
such
it
would
be
a
good
all
day
drinker
the
carbonation
is
also
really
bright
which
makes
it
good
with
some
heavier
foods
like
pasta
and
chicken
marsala
overall
its
better
than
peroni
but
a
far
cry
from
europes
best
12

i
could
finish
this
standard
macro
lager
going
by
a
review
i
did
of
this
back
in
84
gave
it
3
mugs
on
a
six
mug
scale
color
was
a
nice
golden
straw
with
a
clear
hue
head
was
full
and
lasting
and
the
flavor
was
yeasty
and
grainy
aroma
was
also
grainy
or
bready
aftertaste
was
mild
and
clean
better
than
most
examples
of
the
style
fairly
bland
but
drinkable
thinner
body
but
amply
carbonated
decent
crisp
refreshing
feel
simple
flavors
white
bread
lemon
a
bit
of
lime
simple
grains
this
was
decently
refreshing
and
went
quite
well
with
my
pizza
nothing
id
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
but
nothing
id
turn
down
either
overall
this
beer
is
pleasing
yellow
color
and
white
lace
with
a
satisfyingly
failure
smell
and
taste
similar
to
that
of
heineken
in
my
younger
years
in
short
its
an
average
strong
hoppy
bitterness
that
stands
out
the
most
yet
strangely
works
well
with
pizza
overall
3
0
standard
and
slightly
below
in
some
aspects
eurolager
this
would
be
a
good
beer
with
food
and
is
completely
sessionable
but
is
just
kind
of
blah
i
checked
the
price
on
a
six
pack
of
this
and
it
was
are
you
sitting
down
9
00
in
the
atl
area
just
craziness
you
could
get
a
12
pack
of
labatts
for
that
at
some
places
ok
beer
but
just
not
worth
the
price
here
in
the
usa
if
im
ever
in
italy
however
slightly
more
taste
than
its
abv
would
suggest
but
this
beer
is
the
very
definition
of
mediocrity
it
could
be
worse
i
guess
pours
a
clear
gold
color
12

slight

a

bite
and
the
finish
is
rather
dry
and
a
bit
bitter
something
of
a
light
pilsner
not
a
bad
drink
just
not
very
flavorful
o
this
beer
is
pretty
good
and
actually
exceeded
my
expectations
as
far
as
macro
lagers
go
it
looks
pretty
good
as
it
actually
has
some
lacing
and
theres
some
semblance
of
more
than
adjuncts
in
the
smell
flavor
and
mouthfeel
definitely
a
decent
beer
for
what
it
is
d
not
bad
for
what
it
is
the
malt
character
is
a
bit
better
than
average
for
and
international
industrial
lager
and
there
is
an
herbal
hop
flavor
that
gives
it
a
hint
of
pilsner
character
in
the
finish
comes
to
the
table
a
solid
golden
color
with
a
decent
sized
white
head
that
shows
moderate
retention
and
lace
smells
of
floral
hops
and
bready
malt
with
a
hint
of
honey
the
flavor
follows
the
aroma
light
bready
and
floral
with
a
mild
grain
sweetness
light
body
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
and
a
sweet
grainy
mouthfeel
decent
light
lager
nothing
special
but
better
than
the
other
choices
on
the
menu
o
not
bad
for
what
it
is
but
man
oh
man
give
me
an
ipa
or
a
brown
ale
any
day
of
the
week
o
a
mild
version
of
a
heineken
not
a
beer
that
i
will
drink
again
o
its
ok
id
have
more
with
pizza
i
hate
how
it
came
out
smelling
slightly
skunky
but
then
so
did
the
weihenstephaner
original
bright
yellow
body
with
a
white
head
the
smell
is
mainly
sweet
toasted
corn
as
is
the
taste
its
a
very
simple
euro
pale
lager
with
no
frills
finishes
clean
overall
what
can
i
say
its
a
nonskunked
euro
lager
drinkable
but
not
worth
the
price
they
did
make
a
pretty
good
dopplebock
i
give
them
that
o
this
was
a
decent
beer
i
might
have
this
again
o
a
very
nice
lager
hoppier
than
most
epls
this
one
should
satisfy
many
beer
advocates
it
tastes
okay
the
grain
is
forceful
but
not
in
a
bad
way
light
malt
sweetness
and
a
light
hop
bitterness
round
it
out
and
i
find
it
easy
to
drink
i
bought
this
bottle
in
a
mixed
6er
thats
the
only
way
id
buy
it
if
i
wanted
more
overall
good
beer
i
have
had
this
one
a
few
times
now
amd
always
enjoy
it
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
beer
was
the
drinkability
there
is
nothing
really
offensive
about
this
beer
and
for
the
style
it
is
an
easy
drinking
rather
refreshing
brew
the
flavoring
throughout
however
is
pretty
mild
making
the
drinker
wish
for
something
a
little
more
robust
o
not
a
beer
i
will
be
revisiting
someone
left
a
few
in
my
house
and
i
was
just
intrigued
to
try
them
slightly
better
flavor
profile
than
standard
bmc
products
but
only
slightly
incredibly
light
the
drinkability
depends
entirely
on
how
much
carbonation
ends
up
in
that
glass
although
weak
theres
an
interesting
flavor
i
wouldnt
turn
one
down
but
its
by
no
means
a
particularly
good
beer
its
too
sweet
and
bland
overall
45
not
bad
but
ive
had
tastier
lagers
decent
lager
overall
no
better
than
the
average
american
adjunct
lager
why
import
this
all
the
way
from
italy
o
this
beer
went
down
in
seconds
usually
i
want
to
enjoy
drinking
a
beer
but
i
wanted
this
one
down
so
i
can
try
the
next
one
not
bad
for
what
it
is
but
there
are
lots
of
better
choices
yes
euro
decent
lager
on
the
same
road
with
other
macro
breweries
out
there
o
not
the
worst
beer
out
there
but
definately
not
one
to
keep
an
eye
out
for
good
carbonation
fairly
crisp
and
refreshing
certainly
easy
to
drink
and
went
well
with
pizza
although
i
would
have
preferred
something
with
a
bigger
flavor
good
enough
to
wash
down
the
food
though
not
much
more
than
that
you
could
do
a
lot
worse
i
suppose
pretty
clean
but
bland
as
expected
its
a
lager
produced
by
heineken
after
all
ok
for
what
it
is
but
i
wont
be
rushing
out
to
buy
more
o
i
think
ill
pass
on
another
one
of
these
moretti
at
dinner
maggianos
little
italy
to
be
specific
so
an
italian
beer
was
a
must
came
in
a
bottle
which
is
good
because
i
have
had
some
bad
experiences
with
flat
beer
on
tap
lately
the
moretti
has
a
very
clear
golden
color
in
the
glass
with
moderate
carbonation
the
head
is
thin
and
pure
white
with
a
subtle
aroma
of
malt
the
flavor
is
lightly
sweet
and
malty
with
a
faint
finish
of
bitter
very
nice
overall
i
had
a
second
the
moretti
reminded
me
of
heineken
and
as
i
reviewed
the
label
in
more
detail
there
it
was
brewed
by
heineken
in
xxx
italy
its
different
enough
from
heineken
but
there
are
similarities
give
this
easy
drinking
beer
a
try
see
what
you
think
o
this
is
far
from
horrible
but
theres
nothing
that
stands
out
its
just
an
ok
beer
on
a
hot
day
i
wouldnt
mind
one
or
with
foodif
my
choice
was
limited
the
skunky
aroma
can
be
distracting
i
dont
see
myself
buying
this
again
i
had
this
beer
for
the
first
time
in
years
and
by
i
was
shocked
at
how
it
tasted
i
use
to
love
this
beer
but
the
more
mature
your
taste
buds
get
i
guess
you
lose
interest
in
beers
like
this
the
appearance
was
average
with
the
yellow
straw
color
the
smell
was
also
average
with
a
bit
of
malt
and
a
tiny
bit
of
hops
the
taste
was
pretty
watery
with
a
tiny
bit
of
earthy
taste
the
mouthfeel
was
pretty
carbonated
not
much
else
overall
this
is
a
very
boring
beer
i
would
never
buy
it
again
a
decent
lager
very
sessionable
birra
moretti
is
a
crystal
clear
straw
colored
beer
with
a
white
head
that
vanishes
instantly
it
has
a
funky
aroma
with
a
note
of
grass
there
a
very
slight
soft
sweetness
that
kind
of
smells
like
cake
its
pretty
light
bodied
lively
and
smooth
with
a
dry
finish
that
leaves
the
mouth
just
a
touch
silty
its
lightly
flavored
and
just
a
little
funky
it
tastes
grainy
and
theres
a
little
wooden
bitterness
at
the
finish
its
a
bit
like
a
czech
pilsner
its
not
horrible
and
pretty
refreshing
moretti
italian
for
shit
well
not
quite
but
it
is
a
pretty
boring
beer
over
all
looks
like
your
typical
pale
colored
lager
yellow
with
a
white
head
a
little
better
than
budweiser
with
less
adjunk
and
a
little
hoppiness
a
little
metallic
on
the
finish
as
a
guido
i
am
a
little
disappointed
in
my
countrys
beer
offerings
as
of
now
but
i
guess
the
wine
is
good
had
moretti
with
my
pizza
last
night
and
it
wasnt
bad
and
it
wasnt
great
fairly
solid
euro
lager
much
like
all
the
rest
the
appearance
was
golden
clear
and
had
decent
carbonation
but
no
real
head
retention
the
smell
had
some
sweetness
to
it
lil
malty
some
grain
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
the
taste
was
solid
malt
and
grain
start
and
clean
pallet
finish
was
very
good
with
my
pizza
the
mouthfeel
was
easy
and
it
certainly
could
be
a
session
beer
pours
a
clear
lightish
yellow
with
a
1
inch
puffy
white
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
the
top
of
the
beer
thin
broken
rings
of
lace
form
along
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
grain
and
grass
notes
just
like
the
average
euro
pale
lager
taste
is
of
grains
grass
and
citrusy
flavors
a
mild
bitterness
on
the
palate
after
each
sip
a
good
carbonation
level
makes
for
a
crisp
and
clean
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
average
beer
with
nothing
bad
but
nothing
great
unfortunately
it
looks
better
than
it
tastes
which
isnt
to
say
it
tastes
bad
or
anything
just
pretty
average
its
creamy
than
many
of
its
euro
pale
lager
brethren
but
i
can
recall
the
flavor
of
stella
and
heineken
better
than
this
one
although
heinekens
definitely
dont
taste
as
good
i
wouldnt
mind
having
one
of
these
again
but
i
definitely
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
buy
another
it
is
a
very
pale
straw
color
with
a
soapy
white
head
the
beer
is
very
skunky
with
hints
of
apple
raisin
and
grass
the
taste
is
kind
of
funky
with
grains
lemon
and
a
slightly
bitter
finish
the
beer
is
light
with
some
prickly
carbonation
and
a
dry
finish
this
is
just
another
average
euro
lager
lacks
character
but
not
bad
went
rather
well
with
a
pizza
in
stockholm
o
a
pedestrian
non
challenging
non
threatening
beer
this
is
great
for
the
masses
who
would
like
a
weaker
tasting
beverage
this
beer
would
go
acceptably
well
with
most
foods
i
probably
wont
look
for
moretti
again
but
if
i
was
handed
one
i
wouldnt
turn
my
nose
up
at
it
either
overall
try
the
beer
once
at
least
its
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
if
somewhat
bland
and
lacking
in
a
wow
factor
from
the
330
ml
bottle
marked
9323390hl
sampled
on
july
15
2011
the
pour
is
a
typical
pale
lager
straw
yellow
with
a
fizzy
bubbly
head
there
are
pale
malts
in
the
aroma
with
a
slight
hoppiness
the
taste
has
some
malty
character
but
it
is
overpowered
by
the
bitterness
which
is
kind
of
like
chewing
a
pill
it
is
much
like
an
american
macro
o
this
is
ice
cold
and
is
going
down
easy
probably
because
i
am
thirsty
after
a
long
day
i
think
i
will
order
another
o
could
be
okay
if
it
wasnt
so
horrendously
skunky
taste
is
also
very
plain
bread
grain
and
little
bitterness
at
the
end
very
plain
mass
production
beer
will
not
buy
it
again
this
beer
pours
out
of
the
bottle
much
like
all
the
other
lagers
out
there
its
got
that
golden
color
body
with
the
fizzy
white
head
that
evaporates
quickly
the
smell
is
skunky
it
kind
of
overpowers
many
if
not
all
the
other
aromas
in
the
brew
the
taste
is
a
little
funky
too
its
got
some
aspects
of
a
lager
hidden
in
the
aftertaste
its
kinda
dry
and
has
a
medium
body
to
it
i
wouldnt
need
to
have
this
one
again
we
are
in
the
register
of
aqueous
strong
lagers
but
we
must
highlight
the
ease
to
drink
this
potion
the
nose
is
certainly
absent
mouth
very
insipid
and
bitterness
just
limited
to
a
simple
aromatic
hops
unoriginal
but
its
very
simple
to
use
and
fairly
refreshing
no
big
twist
just
a
simple
beer
but
without
big
bad
taste
httpabarwithnoname
wordpress
com
d
flavour
wise
even
in
the
euro
pale
category
its
below
average
in
the
end
its
nonoffensive
it
does
have
some
hop
character
to
it
there
a
lot
worse
out
there
dr
wouldnt
have
it
again
especially
at
irish
prices
next
time
im
at
leos
ill
order
iced
tea
this
is
an
ok
brew
no
flavors
are
potent
the
most
prominent
flavor
is
grain
but
it
is
not
very
strong
pours
a
pale
yellowish
color
with
a
mixed
wheat
and
citrus
scent
has
a
grassy
and
grainy
taste
with
a
light
hint
of
citrus
to
finish
it
off
is
rather
smooth
but
a
little
weak
and
thin
in
its
texture
a
decent
find
though
cheers
drinkability
its
a
very
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
with
bland
flavours
and
aromas
d
well
its
a
step
above
your
run
of
the
mill
macros
just
is
one
mediocre
thing
after
another
with
this
and
somehow
at
4
6
i
can
still
taste
alcohol
m
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
not
very
tasty
mild
kick
and
ok
representation
of
style
not
a
beer
that
i
would
sit
with
for
an
evening
nothing
horribly
wrong
with
this
beer
but
nothing
exciting
either
felt
easy
in
the
mouth
but
close
to
watery
on
average
it
was
average
overall
this
was
about
what
i
expected
it
to
be
a
basic
euro
pale
lager
i
could
see
myself
drinking
this
again
at
an
italian
restaurant
if
there
were
no
other
options
if
i
ever
make
it
to
italy
i
dont
see
myself
wasting
time
with
this
beer
rjt
drinkability
this
was
a
good
choice
compared
to
coors
light
as
i
was
out
for
dinner
not
something
i
would
seek
again
there
are
many
other
breweries
in
italy
that
are
up
and
comers
and
id
focus
on
them
before
id
go
back
to
another
heineken
clone
straw
colored
and
crystal
clear
lots
of
carbonation
fair
head
retention
with
a
bleached
white
head
grainy
aroma
carbonation
bite
with
medium
light
body
unspectacular
middle
and
end
not
much
of
interest
here
drinks
like
a
averageslightly
below
average
light
lager
poured
into
a
pint
glass
from
the
bottle
golden
color
and
fizzy
carbonation
yielded
very
little
head
and
minimal
lacing
smell
was
of
corn
and
a
tiny
bit
of
skunk
have
had
this
at
a
local
italian
restaurant
so
i
tend
to
like
it
mouthfeel
was
thin
and
drinkability
was
high
due
to
the
style
pairs
well
with
italian
food
overall
not
as
good
as
peroni
d
not
very
flavorful
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
mild
kick
about
what
you
would
expect
out
of
the
style
ive
had
worse
but
overall
this
is
not
a
very
good
beer
overall
wouldnt
turn
down
but
definitely
would
ask
if
anything
else
available
to
weight
the
options
d
average
but
bitter
refreshing
but
bland
d
very
average
euro
lager
low
abv
pretty
balanced
and
good
with
pizza
nothing
to
run
looking
for
but
not
bad
overall
a
very
average
experience
color
is
a
bit
vibrant
for
a
pale
lager
but
in
the
end
its
just
yellow
head
is
formidable
and
dissipates
slowly
corny
wheaty
grainy
flavor
very
bubbly
with
a
crisp
dry
finish
ok
all
around
but
uninspiring
would
drink
it
again
if
its
there
but
wouldnt
seek
it
out
a
good
thirst
quenching
lager
but
nothing
special
or
unique
pairs
up
well
with
food
you
can
definitely
tell
it
is
a
euro
pale
lager
thats
for
sure
the
typical
tastes
are
all
there
for
its
style
its
just
fine
very
drinkable
and
sessionable
but
not
the
best
dont
get
it
unless
you
have
too
atmosphere
is
pretty
solid
nice
golden
appearance
with
a
great
sustaining
head
and
plenty
of
lacing
nose
is
pretty
representative
of
the
style
flavor
the
same
nothing
special
but
tastes
like
a
pale
lager
malt
and
yeast
overall
this
is
a
pretty
solid
quaff
clear
thin
pale
yellow
brew
puts
up
1
of
fizzy
white
head
and
a
bunch
of
carbo
clinging
to
the
glass
smell
is
mild
and
predictable
faint
light
malt
sweetness
skunk
and
lemon
hop
taste
is
similar
but
just
a
little
stronger
on
the
hop
and
skunk
feel
is
light
with
just
enough
carbonation
to
keep
it
crisp
but
little
enough
to
keep
it
smooth
and
chuggable
d
ok
if
you
have
to
i
had
this
on
a
train
from
zurich
to
milan
all
things
considered
not
terrible
2
5
overall
again
not
terrible
these
are
the
ones
i
can
throw
down
in
a
half
a
second
ate
dinner
this
past
saturday
night
with
my
wife
at
delfinos
italian
restaurant
in
roslindale
village
ordered
a
bottle
of
moretti
with
my
veal
parmigiana
poured
into
a
semicold
pint
glass
bright
yellow
colored
body
lots
of
carbonation
whispy
white
head
that
faded
quickly
smell
had
some
hints
of
corn
but
not
much
else
taste
was
average
but
not
awful
so
it
was
bearable
just
a
bit
of
hops
and
malt
noticed
in
the
flavor
the
standard
euro
lager
flavor
mouthfeel
was
ok
as
it
was
crisp
cold
and
smooth
an
easy
beer
to
drink
with
italian
food
as
it
doesnt
do
much
to
mask
flavors
in
the
meal
and
does
a
decent
job
cleansing
the
palate
moretti
is
a
fun
beer
to
have
with
some
tasty
italian
food
but
not
a
beer
to
order
at
a
beer
bar
drink
definitely
a
light
tasting
beer
not
something
i
would
seek
out
again
but
not
something
i
would
turn
away
if
offered
to
me
by
a
friend
had
this
at
an
italian
restaurant
and
figured
id
order
it
because
ive
never
had
it
before
pours
a
pale
yellow
with
thin
head
and
no
lacing
not
much
in
terms
of
smell
or
taste
it
has
very
grainy
malt
and
i
dont
really
get
much
hops
or
bitterness
very
prickly
carbonation
makes
this
a
bit
hard
to
drink
i
think
i
would
have
preferred
the
canadian
that
my
friend
ordered
the
pint
arrived
golden
and
clear
with
minimal
head
retention
the
faint
aroma
was
largely
malt
and
a
strange
mineral
odor
the
flavor
was
fairly
sweet
and
slightly
medicinal
with
very
little
hop
presence
or
malt
backbone
overall
it
was
refreshing
if
rather
bland
the
body
was
thin
with
a
largely
clean
mouthfeel
helped
by
noticeable
carbonation
it
was
light
and
refreshing
for
the
summer
but
i
did
not
ask
for
another
mfd
a
crisp
light
beer
easily
drinkable
with
dinner
or
as
a
session
beer
its
just
fine
nothing
special
but
easy
drinker
on
a
hot
day
outside
at
a
pizza
restaurant
poured
into
a
pint
glass
a
pale
lemon
yellow
with
a
small
one
finger
head
that
disappears
quickly
carbonation
continues
to
rise
throughout
though
kind
of
a
sweetsour
fruity
smell
a
subtle
hint
of
grapes
mild
bitterness
in
taste
and
easy
going
down
with
very
little
kick
pleasant
and
refreshing
but
nothing
really
special
it
goes
rather
well
with
a
heavy
pasta
dinner
i
usually
get
a
couple
of
these
when
i
go
to
carabbas
well
probably
ok
for
a
hot
italian
afternoon
i
can
see
why
italy
is
not
so
famous
for
beer
this
one
looks
much
better
then
it
is
the
body
was
fairly
typical
for
the
style
light
and
crisp
drinkability
was
good
smooth
and
easy
and
would
go
good
on
a
hot
afternoon
overall
a
decent
example
of
the
style
worth
a
shot
very
thin
bitter
taste
very
lightbodied
refreshing
with
no
discernible
end
there
are
however
a
good
number
of
tiny
artisanal
producers
popping
up
around
the
country
and
assuming
you
know
where
to
find
them
youre
in
for
some
real
special
often
eccentric
treats
it
can
be
said
with
certainty
that
beer
in
italy
is
finally
starting
to
earn
the
same
appreciation
as
wine
but
as
for
moretti
doing
anything
to
further
that
along
dont
count
on
it
its
beers
like
this
that
are
to
blame
for
the
bad
rep
in
the
first
place
not
a
great
deal
to
write
home
about
very
sessionalable
however
when
it
comes
to
italian
beer
i
will
take
1
panil
to
a
case
of
these
thanks
birra
moretti
cheers
the
beer
pours
a
clear
light
yellow
color
with
a
large
white
head
the
aroma
is
very
heavy
on
the
corn
smells
like
a
macro
lager
the
flavor
is
a
mix
of
corn
with
some
earthy
and
spicy
hops
nothing
in
the
beers
flavor
is
any
good
thin
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
not
a
good
beer
crystal
clear
straw
yellow
with
a
short
white
cap
of
fine

fair

with
a
bit
of
spotty
lace
aromas
of
grainy
malt
lemon
faint
spice
slightly
metallic
moderate

up

but
faded
towards
the
end
malty

lemony
hops
lingered
in
the
finish
accompanied
by
faint

spice
light
bodied
average
carbonation
crisp
and
dry
pretty
solid
overall
especially
compared
to
a
lot
of
other
pale
lagers
ive
had
i
enjoyed
this
a
lot
more
than
the
peroni
i
had
earlier
in
the
afternoon
overall
i
despised
this
beer
when
i
was
in
italy
besides
the
labeling
which
is
kind
of
cool
anyways
this
is
one
of
the
grainiest
beers
i
have
ever
had
there
was
nothing
good
about
it
and
i
found
myself
at
times
lusting
for
a
peroni
which
i
wouldnt
even
touch
in
the
states
if
you
enjoy
wine
stick
to
it
when
in
italy
because
i
didnt
have
a
good
brew
the
whole
time
i
was
there
overall
i
had
zero
expectations
going
in
and
they
were
met
with
flying
colors
epic
fail
d
could
easily
drink
enough
of
these
to
get
alcohol
poisoning
d
eff
that
son
poured
1
0
drinkability
ive
had
this
beer
in
the
past
and
it
wasnt
this
bad
perhaps
this
was
an
old
sample
or
was
abused
in
shipment
or
by
the
restaurant
maybe
ill
try
it
again
to
see
for
sure
taste
light
malt
up
front
complimented
by
equally
subtle
hoppy
finish
smooth
crisp
and
nothing
in
the
way
of
adjuncts
are
noticeable
this
isnt
anything
special
but
it
sure
is
tasty
excellent
session
brew
taste
not
much
barely
a
hop
or
malt
presence
kinda
refreshing
like
a
water
would
be
enjoy
this
more
with
spicy
mexican
than
italian
food
i
dont
understand
why
this
is
all
good
in
europe
but
then
american
crap
is
denigrated
bad
is
bad
this
isnt
bad
but
it
gets
close
i
guess
what
pisses
me
off
the
most
is
how
expensive
this
beer
is
and
for
what
theres
no
mouthfeel
i
really
dont
know
what
ingredients
go
into
it
but
it
aint
much
taste
is
light
and
malty
with
a
very
light
hop
finish
its
pretty
bland
and
inoffensive
though
its
god
to
drink
with
an
italian
meal
though
this
is
a
perfect
champagne
breakfast
buffet
beer
loads
of
burp
from
a
very
clean
light
golden
fizz
and
a
nice
hopped
edge
on
the
aftertaste
whats
not
to
like
for
this
style
certainly
wont
stand
up
to
serious
beer
for
beer
competition
but
this
is
the
type
of
refreshing
hot
summer
beer
thats
best
served
very
cold
for
thirst
quenching
my
wife
was
very
happy
when
i
introduced
her
to
this
beer
like
i
say
this
is
the
best
choice
for
a
breakfast
bar
beer
nothing
else
pours
as
a
very
pale
straw
colour
with
loads
of
carbonation
and
a
massive
foamy
white
head
the
aroma
is
very
weak
what
this
is
is
grainy
with
a
hint
of
soap
again
the
taste
lack
power
there
is
a
slight
bread
malt
with
a
papery
taste
following
and
that
is
pretty
much
it
really
not
a
great
beer
if
you
see
it
dont
bother
it
is
the
typical
golden
straw
color
that
this
category
seems
to
have
though
i
had
minimal
foam
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
i
would
have
friends
who
only
drink
macros
give
this
a
try
it
would
be
a
good
step
into
something
better
pretty
drinkable
i
didnt
notice
any
sweetness
come
through
at
all
a
beer
this
sour
should
be
advertised
as
such
overall
not
a
bad
italian
beer
its
definitely
nothing
special
but
better
than
any
bmc
offering
i
can
think
of
decent
as
far
as
drinkability
is
concerned
not
bad
overall
but
certainly
not
a
must
somewhat
adjuncty
smell
reminds
me
a
bit
of
mexican
lagers
like
sol
or
corona
pours
with
very
little
fizzy
head
which
recedes
leaving
no
lace
medium
straw
transparent
yellow
more
carbonation
apparent
on
the
tongue
than
in
the
glass
not
too
much
flavor
beyond
alcohol
grain
and
fizz
theres
really
no
there
there
easily
drinkable
but
why
pay
premium
prices
for
a
mediocre
beer
d
yet
another
middle
of
the
road
epl
a
perfectly
passable
beer
but
does
nothing
to
justify
its
price
premium
over
many
other
comparable
beers
the
low
abv
makes
this
a
quick
drinker
overall
a
sub
average
beer
d
good
to
accompany
spicy
food
i
had
this
on
tap
at
a
local
restaraunt
it
is
a
pale
clear
yellow
with
an
average
head
the
nose
is
biscuity
slightly
sweet
the
flavor
is
pretty
typical
for
a
euro
lager
sweet
and
bready
with
enough
hops
for
a
bit
of
balance
the
finish
is
crisp
the
beer
is
light
bodied
well
carbonated
and
easy
drinking
even
though
it
is
not
my
favorite
style
this
one
is
not
bad
heineken
owns
this
brewery
and
thats
a
pity
because
i
am
fond
of
this
brewery
and
the
way
they
take
over
the
smaller
breweries
is
a
country
a
bit
grainy
on
the
back
end
but
in
my
experiences
with
italian
beer
over
the
years
i
attribute
the
grainy
minerality
to
the
very
calcic
and
mineralrich
water
that
adds
an
odd
taste
for
many
people
who
are
unused
to
it
overall
an
average
beer
not
much
else
to
say
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
pale
yellow
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
malts
with
a
touch
of
hops
taste
is
slightly
sweet
malts
with
some
hops
feels
medium
bodied
in
mouth
this
beer
goes
down
very
smooth
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
drinkability
decent
if
you
like
this
kind
of
thing
the
strap
line
is
the
beer
in
italy
maybe
thats
why
they
drink
wine
pours
a
pale
clear
yellow
with
a
minor
amount
of
white
head
the
aroma
isnt
too
stark
in
any
directiontheres
a
little
bit
of
malt
and
some
european
hops
taste
is
similar
just
a
tad
bit
sweet
mouthfeel
is
thin
with
a
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
drinkability
is
pretty
good
but
a
little
too
much
carbonation
and
not
enough
flavor
for
me
d
aargh
this
is
foul
d
not
recommended
except
in
the
most
dire
of
circumstances
there
is
very
little
to
suggest
this
beer
flavorless
and
without
character
it
is
the
italian
mgd
poured
into
my
favourite
tasting
glass
a
big
old
fashioned
english
pub
nonic
a
pretty
yellow
or
light
gold
and
clear
it
had
a
white
lace
that
seemed
to
stick
it
was
a
bit
bitter
the
hops
methinks
but
i
kinda
like
that
light
smell
of
hops
and
such
but
the
taste
was
kind
a
bit
of
a
fruity
taste
but
not
unpleasant
just
not
a
real
strong
taste
if
you
offered
it
to
me
at
a
meal
i
would
say
fine
i
regretted
not
trying
it
with
a
pasta
or
some
such
thing
pours
clear
gold
yellow
color
with
a
small
white
head
and
smells
of
malt
and
a
hint
of
yeast
good
clean
and
crisp
lager
with
a
nice
malty
taste
with
a
slight
hint
of
roasted
flavor
and
a
touch
of
sweetness
zero
lacing
medium
to
high
carbonation
and
very
enjoyable
this
beer
has
been
good
over
the
years
and
always
goes
down
smooth
almost
water
like
it
is
what
it
is
a
euro
pale
lager
so
expect
medium
flavor
and
high
drinkability
tastes
alot
like
it
smells
mouthfeel
is
typical
for
this
type
beer
very
sessionable
beer
if
you
like
it
notes
ive
had
this
beer
before
on
draft
and
i
thought
better
of
it
then
drinkability
good
marks
on
drinkability
well
balanced
lightly
hopped
and
at
4
6abv
almost
a
session
beer
full
bodied
notes
i
would
have
been
excited
to
have
this
italian
beer
in
roma
but
it
is
brewed
by
heinekin
d
im
gonna
go
with
an
ok
for
drinkability
not
the
tastiest
euro
pale
lager
ive
had
but
it
is
drinkable
ill
drink
again
but
probably
wont
buy
any
more
of
this
i
had
higher
hopes
from
my
motherland
drinkability
pretty
decent
lager
better
than
bmc
but
nothing
special
cafe
mediterraneo
a
very
nice
restaurant
in
portsmouth
nh
has
this
on
tap
served
in
a
pilsner
glass
it
is
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
thick
white
head
and
some
lacing
a
nicelooking
beer
that
doesnt
live
up
to
the
promise
of
its
appearance
aroma
is
mildly
floral
and
taste
is
mildly
hoppy
and
it
is
somewhat
refreshing
i
think
thats
about
all
there
is
to
say
about
this
beer
slightly
dry
after
taste
nothing
special
which
is
no
surpise
for
the
style
what
is
surprising
is
the
overall
clean
flavors
and
the
lack
of
skunk
or
other
off
flavors
that
seem
to
plauge
many
beers
in
this
style
this
is
a
good
beer
considering
the
style
definitely
drinkable
i
do
recall
enjoying
it
little
more
under
the
italian
sun
in
a
land
with
decidedly
fewer
wine
options
and
way
better
beer
ones
this
is
overwhelmingly
average
however
its
the
only
remotely
appropriate
beer
available
at
my
favorite
neapolitan
pizza
joint
and
the
recently
arrived
summer
heat
again
calls
for
a
cold
one
while
my
opinion
of
this
beer
is
not
very
high
i
have
had
it
several
times
and
will
likely
have
it
again
its
high
carbonation
pairs
well
with
heavy
southern
italian
fare
though
i
typically
find
wine
to
be
the
better
option
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
white
head
not
much
aroma
on
this
one
grains
and
slight
hop
aroma
dominate
very
light
flavor
with
some
grains
and
earth
tones
the
flavor
has
a
soft
maltiness
with
some
bright
citrus
character
up
front
but
gets
nicely
bitter
as
it
goes
back
ok
but
not
great
drinkability
very
easy
but
not
really
worth
drinking
a
beer
pours
a
very
transparent
golden
yellow
color
with
a
small
film
of
white
head
corny
macro
malt
nose
some
hop
presence
but
nothing
impressive
light
in
flavor
and
body
cleaner
than
some
import
macros
but
it
still
leaves
your
tongue
with
a
slightly
offensive
taste
crisp
and
very
drinkable
it
does
its
job
without
a
doubt
d
i
went
into
this
not
knowing
if
i
would
like
it
or
not
i
didnt
know
i
ordered
this
until
she
brought
it
to
me
this
place
i
was
at
had
250
bottles
there
and
i
said
the
wrong
number
it
was
a
interesting
try
but
something
i
would
not
seek
out
on
my
own
again
i
find
it
an
example
of
an
almost
perfect
balance
between
authentic
robust
beer
flavor
and
character
body
yet
light
enough
to
drink
many
of
them
in
one
setting
hmm
this
one
equates
to
a
just
above
average
light
beer
like
most
lagers
not
adjunct
or
macro
it
gets
along
very
well
with
a
thirsty
palate
so
yes
in
a
hot
sunny
day
i
would
have
more
than
one
very
good
euro
pale
ale
not
skunky
and
no
odd
taste
just
very
smooth
and
very
clean
drinking
dont
expect
some
big
flavor
or
some
incredible
beer
expect
a
euro
pale
lager
as
it
should
be
good
beer
that
really
should
be
a
benchmark
for
the
style
drinkable
for
sure
not
too
exciting
but
thats
the
style
it
is
refreshing
and
would
probably
be
good
with
pasta
the
taste
is
nice
clean
but
very
light
it
has
a
crisp
strong
grain
taste
with
mineral
water
junipery
hops
a
bit
sweet
in
the
mostly
grain
aftertaste
a
bit
watery
but
overall
fairly
good
drinkability
another
light
easydrinking
lager
but
thankfully
theres
nothing
inherently
off
or
wrong
about
it
d
an
ok
brew
that
didnt
wow
me
overall
this
is
a
reasonable
beer
ive
definitely
had
many
beers
that
are
better
i
would
not
seek
it
out
however
it
is
a
reasonable
beer
and
would
likely
go
good
with
very
spicy
food
i
will
not
search
for
this
beer
but
when
in
rome
do
as
the
romans
do
this
beer
might
be
just
a
hair
above
average
the
most
inoffensive
aspect
is
the
metal
but
even
that
is
low
as
with
many
imported
beers
there
was
a
bit
of
skunk
that
diminished
as
the
beer
spent
more
time
away
from
the
bottle
overall
its
worth
a
try
i
tried
this
beer
on
a
trip
to
san
pellegrino
italy
the
locals
will
drink
this
beer
if
they
run
out
of
wine
not
a
great
beerit
is
now
imported
by
heineken
it
has
alot
of
the
same
characteristics
as
heineken
the
pilsner
stlye
beer
is
sharp
on
the
toungue
and
finishes
skunky
there
was
a
sour
aftertaste
the
appearance
of
the
beer
was
good
as
the
head
lasted
and
there
was
moderate
lacing
the
hops
were
evident
in
the
nose
and
slightly
in
the
taste
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
pint

can

this
one
going

with

to

not
a

but
a
respectable
euro
lager
pours

a
bitter
sour

clean

taste
not
a
fan
of

could
use
a
little
more
flavor
or
crispness
poured
a
clear

amber

with
a
thin

that
almost
didnt
make

no

kinda
of
a
clean

smell
clean
crisp

also
lightly
hopped
nothing
offensive
nor
overpowering
overall
a
good
example
of
the
style
very
drinkable
and
will
have
it
again
if
its
offered
id
rather
have
a
carlsberg
or
a
german
pils
but
these
arent
as
bad
as
the
reviews
make
them
out
to
be
on
tap
its
unoffensive
and
it
certainly
has
more
flavor
than
the
domestic
macro
lagers
the
italians
seem
to
appreciate
simple
pleasures
to
the
max
and
a
solid
crisp
refreshing
lager
is
one
of
them
the
birra
moretti
had
a
very
clear
golden
appearance
with
some
okay
head
retention
the
aroma
was
sweet
and
slightly
grassy
the
flavor
however
was
pretty
weak
it
had
a
light
smooth
and
slightly
water
mouthfeel
there
is
not
much
to
this
beer
and
would
not
get
this
one
again
on
its
own
it
was
part
of
a
beers
of
the
world
package
pours
a
clear
golden
amber
with
not
much
head
aroma
is
crisp
and
typically
lagerish
but
with
a
hint
of
fruit
flavor
is
like
any
average
lager
except
for
a
fruity
tough
but
with
a
nasty
unpleasantly
bitter
undertone
texture
is
thin
and
it
leaves
a
harsh
bitter
aftertaste
maybe
my
sample
came
from
a
bum
batch
just
a
step
above
the
typical
american
macro
lager
nothing
unappealing
but
nothing
interesting
pale
yellow
in
color
with
no

mild
grainy
smell
with
some
butter
hint
of
grains
and

faint
hint
of
some

green
apple
maybe
its
drinkable
enough
and
went
well
with
my
steak
at
carrabas
next
time
ill
try
thier
la
rossa
d
a
nice
little
brew
here
some
quality
ingredients
lend
subtle
flavors
would
like
a
bit
more
malt
to
fill
it
out
but
i
wish
euro
pale
lagers
like
this
were
more
popular
also
this
is
leaps
and
bounds
better
than
heineken
d
an
ok
beer
that
i
prefer
to
many
other
euro
lagers
clean
flavor
through
and
through
d
would
get
it
again
but
not
by
choice
probably
would
be
better
on
a
warm
day
but
other
than
that
nothing
to
rave
about
drinkability
an
average
beer
in
the
style
pale
lager
d
very
drinkable
best
aspect
of
the
beer
is
you
can
pound
it
d
undoubtably
a
very
drinkable
lager
personal
choice
over
american
lagers
it
was
a
very
standard
lager
in
my
opinion
it
poured
a
very
nice
color
of
amber
with
no
head
at
all
there
was
almost
no
smell
and
the
taste
is
exactly
what
i
expected
a
thin
balance
of
hops
and
malt
that
didnt
linger
at
all
smooth
drinker
could
see
myself
having
multiple
of
these
if
that
was
what
i
was
in
the
mood
for
an
average
beer
youll
get
what
you
expect
drinkability
avoid
this
beer
it
is
awful
d
just
too
bland
overall
to
entice
me
back
a
little
too
bitter
without
some
complimentary
sweetnesscitrusanything
overallmy
short
sentences
define
everything
its
a
standard
euro
pale
doesnt
do
anything
outside
the
ordinary
drinkable
turbog
is
a
little
better
peroni
much
worse
on
tap
at
mission
pizza
in
fremont
a
clear
yellow
beverage
with
a
fluffy
white
head
aroma
is
mild
light
grain
and
hops
borders
on
skunky
but
not
offensively
so
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
watery
more
so
than
its
appearance
would
suggest
but
it
has
a
pronounced
sweet
malt
flavor
balanced
with
a
crisp
hop
finish
and
is
ultimately
a
fairly
drinkable
beer
i
would
think
it
would
go
very
well
with
pizza
but
ill
have
to
verify
that
some
other
day
overall
its
not
great
but
its
not
that
bad
either
good
enough
to
drink
more
than
one
of
i
wont
be
getting
it
again
anytime
soon
but
its
still
a
decent
beer
an
average
euro
pale
theres
not
much
to
look
at
smell
or
even
taste
but
it
somehow
manages
to
have
more
good
than
bad
flavors
making
it
pretty
drinkable
for
what
it
is
wholly
average
in
all
respects
not
a
great
deal
of
carbonation
ok
beer
probably
will
not
buy
again
its
very
light
almost
watery
easy
to
drink
like
lemon
water
but
the
metal
taste
is
the
real
turn
off
note
i
was
trying
to
buy
la
rosa
because
i
heard
that
was
the
best
of
the
bunch
from
this
brewery
must
have
picked
this
up
when
i
wasnt
looking
close
enough
really
dissapointing
very
average
lager
nothing
special
about
it
at
least
it
is
quite
refreshing
actually
better
than
expected
considering
i
bought
it
very
cheap
in
the
supermarket
a
light
golden
in
color
with
a
one
finger
white
head
that
quickly
faded
and
no
lacing
strong
metallic
smell
thats
a
real
turn
off
taste
is
dry
grainy
metallic
tasting
and
little
hop
body
to
it
mouthfeel
and
carbonation
were
ok
pass
this
beer
up
its
not
worth
the
price
d
below
average
drinkability
cant
think
of
much
of
a
reason
to
finish
the
beer
i
got
let
alone
drink
another
one
was
a
struggle
to
finish
to
say
the
least
and
one
that
is
best
avoided
their
la
rossa
was
better
try
this
instead
not
really
an
instant
favorite
of
mine
but
is
probably
the
best
italian
beer
that
ive
had
so
far
but
really
considering
the
wines
that
italy
produces
isnt
this
like
expecting
a
great
suv
from
ferrari
pours
a
clear
light
gold
some
carbonation
visible
decent
white
sticky
head
dissipates
quickly
leaving
only
a
thin
ring
around
the
edge
of
the
mug
smells
grainy
some
corn
and
slightly
sweet
tastes
like
slightly
sweet
honeyed
grains
and
a
bitter
finish
low
carbonation
gives
it
an
almost
smooth
and
creamy
feel
in
the
mouth
but
the
body
is
a
little
thin
low
in
alcohol
but
this
beer
isnt
quite
refreshing
enough
for
even
a
very
hot
day
and
nothing
impresses
me
enough
to
want
another
mouthfeel
was
rather
sharp
some
grainy
roughness
medium
to
light
body
overall
better
than
i
expected
and
a
nice
accompaniment
to
a
meal
md
a
sharp
feel
from
the
hidden
carbonation
had
a
medium
amount
of
weight
and
felt
a
little
grainy
a
refreshing
brew
and
a
decently
drinkable
beer
pours
yellowgold
with
a
white
head
that
actually
retains
pretty
well
aroma
is
faint
grass
and
grain
flavor
is
analogous
to
a
us
macro
but
without
the
disgusting
adjunct
taste
light
grainy
and
a
little
fruity
easy
to
drink
goes
well
with
food
a
bit
grassy
and
grainy
light
body
and
crisp
finish
i
guess
drinkability
is
pretty
good
its
just
not
great
thisll
be
my
first
italian
lager
and
so
far
its
not
good
ill
give
it
one
more
try
assuming
i
can
get
a
fresh
bottle
which
is
probably
unlikely
as
they
do
not
put
dates
on
them
d
easy
to
drink
not
a
whole
lot
going
on
here
kinda
boring
and
simple
overall
a
painfully
average
european
lager
neither
offensive
nor
notable
in
any
way
id
rate
it
one
step
above
heineken
and
two
steps
below
a
spaten
paulaner
et
al
definately
not
a
beer
id
drink
again
unless
i
was
at
a
bar
in
italy
and
in
that
case
id
probably
drink
some
of
the
local
wine
this
beer
just
isnt
very
insipring
cant
think
of
anything
that
recommends
this
for
any
reason
started
off
with
something
light
today
and
it
was
not
bad
my
friend
had
talked
about
how
good
this
was
over
in
europe
so
i
decided
to
give
it
a
try
would
not
drink
again
not
worth
trying
drinkability
is
pretty
good
its
a
touch
too
sweet
for
what
it
is
and
rather
boring
but
theres
nothing
wrong
with
it
overall
not
as
bad
as
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
no
skunk
and
a
very
clean
finish
not
bad
not
bad

with

hint
of
bittering
hops
pleasant
smell
taste
is
kind
of
light
and
sweet
with
honey
again
and
some
mild
balancing
bittering
hops
very
easy
drinking
with
no
off
flavors
just
a
touch
too
sweet
with
light
carbonation
and
nice
for
a
pale
lager
though
i
would
get
this
over
other
macros
but
it
is
just
psychological
this
pours
a
clear
crisp
gold
with
thin
bubbly
head
that
leaves
behind
a
little
bit
of
lace
the
aromas
are
mostly
of
grainy
malts
and
a
euro
skunkieness
the
taste
is
straight
forward
and
similar
to
your
average
macro
lageragain
with
a
euro
lager
aftertastealmost
has
some
nonalcoholic
similarities
in
flavorcardboard
comes
to
mind
there
just
wasnt
anything
that
seperates
this
from
your
average
run
of
the
mill
bmc
honestly
i
could
drink
12
of
these
beers
someone
gave
me
this
beer
so
im
not
that
upset
on
the
whole
this
is
a
pretty
uninspired
beer
one
wonders
what
birra
moretti
was
like
before
heineken
took
them
over
now
its
just
a
run
of
the
mill
macro
lager
pass
on
this
one
this
is
a
good
beer
it
poured
a
nice
light
amber
with
a
small
head
the
taste
was
surprising
and
full
flavored
for
the
style
with
a
good
balance
between
hops
and
its
great
sweet
malt
backbone
the
mouthfeel
was
exceptionally
creamy
i
would
definitely
have
it
again
d
a
decent
euro
lager
that
in
my
opinion
deserves
a
little
better
recognition
than
what
it
has
been
getting
on
this
site
its
clean
its
refreshing
and
makes
a
great
session
beer
on
that
note
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
the
un
beerunremarkable
uninteresting
underwhelming
pours
a
transparent
straw
yellow
with
very
little
head
and
no
lacing
to
speak
of
i
honestly
could
not
detect
any
smell
to
this
beer
and
the
same
thing
can
be
said
about
the
taste
there
is
nothing
to
this
beer
water
with
a
small
small
small
hint
of
malt
this
is
what
i
would
expect
if
someone
was
trying
to
pass
something
off
as
beer
that
clearly
wasnt
beer
the
only
thing
about
this
beer
that
can
be
said
is
it
has
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
and
is
easy
to
drink
but
that
is
about
it
not
good
i
had
no
expectations
of
this
beer
that
my
parents
picked
up
in
sicily
nor
for
any
euro
pale
lagers
this
one
was
okay
however
no
bitterness
like
others
some
notes
of
berries
no
head
retention
and
below
average
carbonation
drinkable
enough
maybe
nice
on
warm
day
i
essentially
bought
this
to
give
italy
a
chance
at
showing
me
what
they
offer
in
terms
of
brewing
and
it
is
a
decent
lager
but
i
would
certainly
reach
for
a
beer
from
elsewhere
if
given
the
option
to
do
so
poured
a
clear
golden
color
with
decent
white
head
that
dissipated
fairly
quickly
not
too
much
aroma
to
speak
of
much
like
an
american
macro
lager
taste
was
actually
pretty
decent
i
was
pleasantly
suprised
very
smooth
and
easy
drinking
wouldnt
seek
this
out
but
wouldnt
turn
down
either

drinkability
was
good
carbonation
seemed
slightly
off
for
the
taste
but
it
surely
went
down
smooth
and
this
seemed
to
be
a
good
beer

you
needed
to
pace
yourself
through

long

more
like
bread
dough
this
had
more
flavor
than
i
expected
tasted
more
like
a
dark
beer
than
the
color
showed
not
sure
how
long
it
was
in
the
fridge
probably
wouldnt
run
out
to
personally
buy
a
case
but
would
like
to
review
under
different
circumstances
this
is
a
ho
hum
beer
but
decent
for
a
macro
lager
it
has
more
hops
and
body
than
its
american
counterparts
still
pretty
insipid
though
overall
this
was
a
simple
yet
enjoyable
beer
would
make
a
great
session
brew
as
its
pretty
easy
to
knock
more
than
a
few
of
these
down
at
a
sitting
drinkability
pretty
go
with
italian
food
a
little
too
expensive
to
be
a
party
beer
d
this
is
probably
my
favorite
of
the
euro
pales
its
smoother
and
not
as
sharp
bitterness
is
still
mild
but
these
just
seem
to
go
down
very
easily
plus
how
could
you
not
love
the
man
on
the
bottle
is
he
contemplating
the
beer
or
sulking
in
it
who
knows
but
im
about
to
join
him
d
this
is
a
fair
average
euro
pale
lager
nothing
outstanding
and
nothing
id
buy
but
if
its
free
ill
drink
it
pours
a
very
pale
color
with
a
thick
fluffy
head
that
recedes
slowly
aroma
is
strong
and
malty
bready
as
well
nothing
truly
special
here
taste
is
very
thin
and
suprisingly
drinkable
goes
down
like
water
and
leaves
little
if
any
aftertaste
might
be
good
on
a
hot
day
of
mowing
a
lawn
but
largely
unimpressive
still
worth
it
if
youre
in
italy
considering
the
price
d
i
recall
years
ago
having
this
brew
before
heineken
took
it
over
at
that
time
i
enjoyed
the
lager
and
shared
it
with
friends
the
current
version
is
too
thin
lacks
character
and
has
a
distasteful
sour
aftertaste
wantabe
beer
at
best
d
very
good
i
had
three
with
my
birthday
meal
it
was
perfect
with
my
pasta
too
good
that
was
full
of
chicken
and
shrimp
in
a
butter
sauce
this
beer
complemented
my
meal
really
well
this
beer
is
basically
a
step
up
from
bud
but
more
expensive
and
like
bud
it
would
be
a
great
beer
to
drink
after
coming
home
from
working
out
in
the
sun
all
day
oh
yeah
and
did
i
mention
the
mustachio
is
killer
its
an
italian
budweiser
except
a
little
better
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
but
that
is
about
it
this
beer
poured
fine
not
much
of
a
head
but
a
nice
carbonated
bubbling
its
smell
though
was
rather
acidic
and
sour
its
tasted
was
equally
sour
its
a
rare
beer
that
i
cannot
finish
but
this
was
one
i
made
it
maybe
a
quarter
of
the
way
down
my
glass
before
quitting
i
thought
i
had
bought
a
bad
single
so
i
waited
a
week
and
tried
again
but
with
the
same
results
after
drinking
the
occasional
peroni
i
was
a
disappointed
in
this
brew
pours
a
pale
golden
yellow
color
that
looks
almost
neon
in
color
thin
white
layer
of
head
almost
completely
disappears
smell
is
of
corn
and
grains
with
a
light
skunky
kind
of
smell
mouthfeeling
is
a
little
oily
and
watery
not
the
greates
of
beers
but
i
like
to
enjoy
this
at
some

moderate
aroma
has
notes
of
maize
corn
and
cooked
vegetables
hints
of
flowers
and
honey
spritzy
mouthfeel
the
flavour
actually
has
some
malts
and
also
moderate
hops
in
the
finish
so
this
one
is
far
from
being
the
worst
pale
lager
ive
tasted
quite
drinkable
pale
yellow
color
with
a
whispy
head
at
best
but
good
lacing
smells
of
grapefruit
and
bread
pretty
straight
forward
typical
faire
it
tastes
of
mild
wheat
with
a
citrus
overtone
a
little
malt
noted
it
is
nicely
carbonated
very
fine
bubblage
paired
with
pasta
as
i
did
while
sampling
this
at
a
restaurant
in
manhattan
this
became
quite
suite
like
cantaloupe
fairly
ordinary
no
need
to
run
out
looking
for
this
one
but
refreshing
enough
good
with
food
etc
one
of
the
better
less
macroskunk
flavored
tasting
and
drinking
euro
pale
lagers
in
my
flight
drinkability
i
would
drink
this
as
an
alternative
to
the
normal
macro
lager
this
is
a
really
good
beer
for
price
i
wouldnt
chase
it
but
i
wouldnt
run
from
it
either
not
a
whole
lot
to
say
about
this
one
it
looks
good
in
my
stange
glass
smells
and
tastes
like
a
pale
lager
but
it
was
rather
watery
feeling
you
could
drink
it
like
water
if
you
wanted
to
but
why
would
you
i
imagine
its
better
with
food
than
as
an
after
dinner
drink
certainly
preferable
to
a
bud
or
a
coors
but
really
nothing
notable
or
memorable
about
this
one
standard
european
macro
well
this
is
a
beer
i
was
not
expecting
much
and
my
wishes
came
rue
pale
straw
yellow
color
a
very
slight
malty
sweetness
in
smell
taste
light
malt
flavor
very
light
citrusy
flavor
light
hopiness
thin
mouthfeel
overall
it
is
not
impressive
if
i
were
to
compare
to
any
bmc
i
would
say
its
a
lot
better
than
what
we
can
produce
and
if
bmc
wants
to
make
a
good
dull
beer
this
would
be
it
a
nice
lawnmower
beer
and
thats
about
it
overall
a
beer
that
is
lacking
in
any
depth
or
character
average
beer
i
enjoy
the
rossa
more
and
need
to
find
the
nonheineken
version
of
this
beer
to
see
if
its
better
this
is
a
pretty
uninspiring
beer
within
its
style
its
fine
but
i
just
cant
get
behind
this
beer
i
could
be
wrong
but
birra
moretti
might
be
the
first
italian
beer
ive
ever
had
the
beer
poured
a
pale
yellow
with
visable
bubbles
the
aroma
was
clean
but
non
distinct
it
had
a
transparent
deep
golden
hue
with
a
thin
white
head
and
moderate
lacing
full
smooth
mouthfeel
well
malted
flavor
compares
well
with
many
classic
german
lagers
overall
a
fairly
decent
if
unremarkable
euro
lager
drinkability
ehh
just
another
macroesque
brew
not
horrible
but
no
reason
to
revisit
again
i
feel
sorry
if
this
is
italys
go
to
brew
pours
a
very
light
crystal
clear
straw
color
i
can
actually
see
my
fingerprint
on
the
other
side
of
the
glass
through
the
beer
theres
a
little
white
fluffy
head
that
fades
away
pretty
quickly
the
smell
is
slightly
yeasty
and
not
much
else
tastes
fairly
clean
with
some
slight
hop
character
but
very
little
i
cant
taste
any
malt
at
all
it
must
be
made
with
a
lot
of
adjuncts
finishes
cleanly
mouthfeel
is
bubbly
and
a
little
creamy
not
bad
overall
its
fairly
drinkable
cause
theres
not
much
there
to
object
to
other
than
that
its
a
standard
macro
with
little
flavor
average
looking
lager
some
retention
and
lacing
which
may
turn
out
better
if
id
let
the
beer
warm
a
bit
more
smells
of
grainy
malt
and
slightly
of
cooked
veggies
first
swig
did
not
make
a
good
impression
maybe
the
old
guy
is
spitting
into
his
mug
bland
except
for
a
harsh
mineral
water
aftertaste
mouthfeel
noted
a
touch
a
creaminess
but
cant
get
over
how
blah
this
lager
is
at
12
99sixer
ill
be
taking
a
pass
on
this
one
mediumlight
yellow
with
a
very
small
white
frothy
quicklydiminishing
head
smells
of
that
typical
euro
graininess
with
that
typical
euro
stink
grain
and
straw
tastes
like
all
the
characteristics
of
heineken
i
dont
like
magnified
it
has
a
thin
body
watery
texture
and
low
carbonation
overall
theres
no
reason
to
ever
pay
this
much
for
a
cheaply
made
import
my
loving
wife
brought
me
back
a
750
ml
bottle
of
this
from
her
trip
to
italy
the
bottle
sports
an
october
2007
freshness
date
pours
a
crisp
clear
yellow
with
a
thin
white
head
very
little
intention
pretty
basic
beer
clean
taste
malty
center
little
bit
of
a
hoppy
aftertaste
slightly
watery
mouthfeel
although
not
exceptional
this
beer
is
definitely
a
step
up
from
a
vast
majority
of
american
macro
lagers
very
easily
drinkable
not
too
complex
but
goes
down
well
pours
a
pale
yellow
with
a
thin
white
head
not
much
retention
but
good
lacing
nice
bottle
smell
is
weakand
breadywith
maybe
some
faint
hops
body
is
thinand
carbionated
taste
is
typical
macro
grainy
with
a
slightly
bitter
finish
i
would
take
it
over
a
bud
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
poured
a
light
straw
forming
a
very
thin
head
that
faded
quickly
leaving
very
light
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
slightly
skunky
with
a
little
hop
citrus
notes
the
taste
is
light
hops
a
little
grain
flavor
and
water
mouthfeel
is
very
light
and
thin
overall
this
tastes
like
a
cross
between
st
pauli
girl
and
bud
light
not
horrible
but
i
could
not
make
a
session
out
of
this
one
i
would
recommend
the
moretti
amber
much
more
flavor
and
an
overall
better
beer
the
taste
wasnt
anything
to
write
home
about
either
typical
euro
pale
fare
with
a
cerealgrain
flavor
dominating
a
bitterskunky
finish
and
little
hop
or
malt
character
in
between
it
tasted
almost
exactly
like
a
fosters
for
my
money
the
one
thing
i
did
enjoy
was
the
mouthfeel
it
wasnt
overly
carbonated
but
smooth
and
fairly
fullbodied
that
was
unexpected
would
i
have
another
no
thanks
looks
fine
smells
fine
both
standard
macro
lager
fare
taste
was
okay
weak
malt
profile
slight
hops
maybe
a
hint
of
grapes
until
it
warmed
a
bit
then
it
tasted
very
stale
very
high
level
of
carbonation
made
tasting
the
beer
a
struggle
wouldnt
turn
it
down
if
it
were
the
only
thing
offered
but
i
would
definitely
not
purposely
have
this
again
pours
a
pale
golden
yellow
with
a
2
finger
head
that
dissipates
quickly
not
much
to
smell
not
much
to
taste
some
hops
all
very
mild
and
thin
in
the
mouth
maybe
okay
on
a
hot
summer
day
you
could
throw
down
a
few
of
these
to
quench
your
thirst
only
my
second
italian
beer
d
suffers
from
the
bitterness
and
musky
rotgut
taste
i
will
never
drink
this
again
this
beer
is
drinkable
but
average
i
prefer
an
american
lager
to
a
euro
anyway
but
i
think
there
are
probably
better
euro
lagers
as
well
no
real
mouthfeel
this
has
not
impressed
me
at
all
on
a
warm
sunny
day
in
italy
it
may
taste
different
but
on
a
cold
november
night
in
england
it
has
scored
very
poorly
pours
yellow
into
pilsner
glass
white
head
with
moderate
retention
leaves
some
lacing
aroma
is
grainy
and
floral
hops
malty
flavor
with
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
this
is
without
a
doubt
better
than
any
us
macro
lagers
but
is
kind
of
average
amoung
european
lagers
if
this
were
the
best
available
i
would
choose
this
and
enjoy
it
but
otherwise
i
probably
wont
revisit
this
beer
birra
moretti
is
enjoyable
to
a
great
limit
but
since
is
export
i
believe
its
price
is
not
compare
for
what
you
are
buying
i
even
had
italian
opinion
saying
that
naztro
azzuro
is
the
best
italian
beer
and
i
agree
d
easy
drinker
but
boring
poured
a
pale
yellow
body
with
a
nice
foamy
white
head
and
thousands
of
tiny
bubbles
that
continuously
streamed
to
the
top
aroma
is
of
sweet
malt
along
with
some
grassy
notes
tastes
of
sweet
grain
with
just
a
hint
of
malt
in
the
background
and
a
slight
bitterness
in
the
finish
lightbodied
with
a
fair
amount
of
carbonation
real
easy
to
drink
but
just
a
little
too
boring
to
want
to
birra
moretti
pours
a
pale
yellow
with
a
thin
white
head
from
a
brown
twelve
ounce
bottle
the
aroma
has
a
mild
skunk
note
and
i
think
i
smell
corn
the
taste
is
decent
it
is
heavy
on
the
malt
not
bad
for
a
lawnmower
type
beer
i
like
that
there
really
isnt
any
skunk
in
the
taste
which
is
all
to
common
in
euro
lagers
worth
a
try
overalla
decent
selection
from
a
fellow
beer
club
memeber
however
as
summer
is
winding
down
this
light
refresing
deck
beer
comes
a
tad
late
for
me
12
oz
bottle
with
some
code
on
the
label
served
in
a
pilsner
glass
it
pours
a
clear
medium
gold
with
light
carbonation
and
a
finger
of
white
head
that
leaves
some
wisps
of
lace
it
smells
clean
with
lemonapple
and
a
light
skunkspice
the
taste
is
similar
with
the
addition
of
grapes
and
grassyspicy
hops
that
leave
a
mild
bitterness
the
body
is
medium
thicker
than
expected
with
medium
carbonation
and
a
short
finish
overall
not
great
but
more
flavorful
than
american
macros

an

nothing

not

not

beer
either
a
very
pale
yellow
pour
with
good
carbonation
and
thin
white
head
that
floated
atop
the
glass
but
virtually
no
lacing
aroma
was
your
typical
bmctype
skunky
hops
and
the
flavor
wasnt
anything
to
write
home
about
this
all
added
up
to
a
lackluster
dry
finish
i
enjoyued
the
moretti
la
rossa
but
this
one
didnt
do
anything
for
me
it
was
fairly
sharp
and
crisp
but
after
two
bottles
id
be
squinting
at
the
brew
too
not
recommended
this
beer
was
lighter
in
coler
with
just
a
bit
of
golden
hue
there
was
a
foamy
white
head
the
smell
was
of
corn
the
taste
was
like
a
light
beer
with
a
touch
of
vanilla
there
was
a
sore
throat
like
aftertaste
usually
assostiated
with
malt
liqour
the
mouthfeel
was
fairly
creamy
but
the
aftertaste
was
too
much
i
would
likely
pass
this
beer
next
time
drinkability
certainly
useable
as
a
quaffer
but
brings
little
else
to
the
table
as
simple
as
they
get
very
average
all
around
it
was
an
easy
drinker
though
very
smooth
and
light
and
since
its
about
105
degrees
right
now
i
found
it
easy
to
suck
this
baby
down
the
euro
malt
flavors
are
always
welcomed
by
me
i
could
easily
enjoy
a
few
of
these
on
a
hot
day
when
just
looking
for
an
easy
drinker
better
than
peroni
pretty
average
euro
lager
similar
to
the
heineken
i
had
last
night
and
surprise
surprise
this
beer
is
affiliated
with
heineken
a
decent
beer
that
is
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
another
one
since
heineken
is
similar
more
readily
available
and
cheaper
overall
this
one
isnt
bad
id
take
it
over
many
other
green
bottle
euro
lagers
never
been
a
euro
pale
lager
fan
but
this
ones
not
too
bad
no
skunkiness
and
fairly
smooth
a
good
light
lager
for
warm
weather
days
and
to
drink
anytime
notes
did
nothing
to
change
my
mind
about
how
i
feel
about
lagers
nothing
else
really
to
say
about
this
one
eric
very
drinkable
beer
recommended
especially
when
in
italy
overall
overall
quite
clean

nothing
bad
going
on
but
not
a
beer
that
stands
out
either
light
golden
color
white
fine
white
head
and
fine
carbonation
beading
throughout
the
beer
the
beer
has
a
moderate
creamy
head
with
good
retention
the
aroma
is
strong
and
sweet
and
the
beer
has
a
light
sweet
taste
with
a
very
slight
toasted
malt
flavor
this
beer
is
light
on
the
palate
but
toasty
this
is
a
tasty
beer
for
the
style
and
would
be
a
great
hot
summer
day
drinking
beer
a
very
drinkable
italian
beer
i
had
this
in
a
restaurant
but
would
consider
picking
up
a
six
pack
this
is
a
decent
beer
light
colored
light
flavored
while
it
doesnt
offend
it
did
not
keep
me
from
switching
over
to
some
interesting
wines
for
dinner
decent
enough
for
a
waiting
for
your
table
beer
drinkability
for
a
hot
day
refreshing
better
selection
than
many
other
lagers
such
as
becks
or
heineken
for
a
european
lager
its
not
bad
overall
a
very
average
beer
neither
offensive
nor
special
in
any
way
for
italian
beers
better
than
peroni
or
castello
not
as
good
as
moretti
la
rossa
but
more
refreshing
than
la
rossa
on
a
warm
day
or
as
a
thirst
quencher
could
have
this
as
a
mediocre
session
beer
otherwise
borrring
rather
drinkable
due
to
a
good
flavor
and
a
mouthfeel
that
keeps
you
going
back
for
more
despite
being
a
rather
forgettable
pale
lager
a
good
quaffable
beer
id
pick
this
over
any
macro
lager
overall
i
like
this
one
over
others
in
its
style
a
little
different
in
its
flavor
but
rather
enjoyable
very
pale
gold
in
color
very
clear
with
a
tiny
head
aroma
is
a
bit
bready
but
the
warm
slightly
sour
smell
reminds
me
most
of
piss
sorry
not
trying
to
be
derisive
just
descriptive
the
flavor
is
straight
macro
lager
with
little
in
the
way
of
malt
flavor
and
a
slight
hop
bite
for
bitterness
not
very
substantial
this
beer
fades
from
the
palate
quickly
and
doesnt
fill
you
up
theres
not
really
much
here
to
like
but
too
much
to
dislike
either
this
beers
offensiveness
is
in
its
banality
figured
id
crack
an
italian
beer
during
the
olympics
and
i
hadnt
reviewed
this
bad
boy
yet
very
clear
pale
yellow
color
decent
head
for
a
lager
as
light
as
this
faint
grassy
aroma
nothing
too
much
going
on
in
the
flavor
department
either
not
offensive
in
the
least
bit
im
really
just
pleasantly
surprised
this
wasnt
complete
euroskunk
drinkability
bland
and
forgettable
most
of
these
euro
lagers
are
as
repetative
as
american
macro
lagers
overall
an
average
lager
worth
a
try
maybe
once
i
had
this
one
ontap
as
an
accompaniment
to
dinner
its
a
pale
straw
color
with
a
large
fluffy
white
head
very
modest
aroma
grassy
a
little
grain
a
slight
hop
smell
the
taste
is
of
pale
base
malt
and
corn
theres
a
little
hop
bitterness
the
brew
is
of
moderate
sweetness
with
a
very
light
body
and
fairly
high
carbonation
theres
really
not
very
much
thats
special
about
this
brew
its
a
slightly
above
average
macro
lager
its
decent
and
enjoyable
for
what
it
is
but
doesnt
go
beyond
that
taste
is
unimpressive
although
not
quite
as
bad
as
i
expected
given
my
dislike
of
the
nose
the
mouthfeel
has
a
sharp
character
to
it
which
gives
it
a
slight
kick
a
good
thing
given
that
otherwise
the
taste
is
fairly
bland
there
is
a
european
slightly
sweet
character
to
the
hops
but
there
is
not
much
else
to
speak
of
its
slightly
bitter
slightly
tangy
slightly
flavoursome
slightly
drinkable
pours
to
a
golden
color
with
a
good
head
doesnt
hold
up
too
bad
has
good
carbonation
almost
a
honey
aroma
tastes
sweet
with
a
smooth
finish
throughout
light
and
smooth
refreshing
after
a
15
hour
day
a
good
thirst
quenching
beer
i
could
drink
many
of
these
especially
in
the
heat
refreshing
but
not
as
quite
as
tasty
as
when
purchased
in
a
quart
bottle
from
a
street
vendor
in
venice
and
quaffed
while
sitting
on
the
seawall
really
pale
in
color
but
with
a
nice
large
fluffy
white
head
aroma
is
dry
and
spicy
with
a
wet
grass
note
taste
seems
to
offer
little
other
than
a
straw
grain
quality
a
bit
of
cardboard
in
there
and
some
residual
sweetness
finish
is
dry
with
some
grassy
hops
aftertaste
leaves
a
metallic
note
in
my
mouth
it
became
hard
to
finish
just
one
theres
some
flavor
here
but
most
of
it
are
offflavors
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
some
decent
crispness
in
the
finish
poured
into
a
pilsner
glass
and
it
dosent
look
bad
pale
good
clarity
vicious
carbonation
and
good
head
retention
dosent
look
flat
at
all
a
problem
ive
had
with
generic
eurolagers
smell
is
sweet
and
malty
i
was
expecting
a
certain
skunkiness
but
its
not
there
thankfully
taste
is
very
bready
so
much
as
to
be
almost
nutty
not
much
more
a
slight
hoppy
bitterness
washing
down
a
decently
balanced
brew
im
surprised
with
this
one
not
complex
but
quaffable
and
the
4
6
isnt
a
drawback
as
it
feels
pretty
fullbodied
in
the
mouth
this
is
a
surprisingly
good
lager
much
more
than
i
was
expecting
drinkability
being
this
as
light
as
it
is
you
can
probably
down
a
few
a
night
and
still
drink
some
more
clear
straw
yellow
with
some
golden
hues
a
foamy
bright
white
head
rises
up
a
full
inch
and
leaves
some
simmering
meringue
that
slowly
fades
aroma
is
slightly
bitter
and
grassy
a
little
malty
flavor
is
buttered
corn
upfront
followed
by
biscuity
malt
with
a
slight
tingle
in
the
finish
which
may
be
more
from
carbonation
than
hops
flavor
is
even
not
too
complex
but
refreshing
and
enjoyable
biscuity
malt
and
hints
of
corn
continue
evenly
throughout
the
glass
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
even
moderate
carbonation
pours
a
2
finger
head
that
laces
the
glass
strongly
has
a
nice
herbal
spicy
aroma
its
taste
sans
the
nice
aroma
is
quite
macrolager
prototypical
with
a
light
mouthfeel
very
drinkable
as
a
macrolager
should
be
a
nice
addition
to
an
italian
meal
out
i
would
not
go
thirsty
by
not
drinking
this
one
it
was
an
alright
beer
with
little
above
average
drinkability
another
gem
i
found
at
the
local
winndixie
that
was
closing
paid
4
30
for
a
six
cool
label
thats
about
all
i
can
say
good
about
this
beer
pours
a
very
pale
golden
yellow
color
with
little
head
sweet
malty
aroma
with
a
little
grassiness
in
the
background
nothing
noteworthy
in
the
taste
department
an
italian
fosters
as
a
side
note
i
just
had
a
steinlager
that
would
kick
this
beers
ass
this
seems
way
off
target
stylewise
in
comparison
slightly
watered
down
mouthfeel
but
flavors
of
corn
and
dry
grains
are
evident
bitter
foreign
hop
quality
with
a
bland
backdrop
a
straight
euro
lager
but
nothing
special
smelled
like
a
typical
lager
except
that
ill
add
this
beer
does
have
a
backbone
in
the
smell
a
bit
of
a
malty
burnt
type
smell
that
had
me
interested
my
first
gobble
was
nice
and
refreshing
as
the
beer
warmed
up
a
bit
it
was
tougher
to
consume
as
the
carbonation
wore
off
quickly
which
left
to
much
of
the
beer
undisguised
it
has
a
surprisingly
nice
mouthfeel
though
that
has
a
bit
of
a
creamy
feel
overall
a
beer
i
could
session
without
hesitation
really
needs
some
flavor
behind
it
drinkability
it
drinks
easy
and
smooth
and
you
could
easily
knock
a
few
of
these
back
but
when
it
comes
to
italian
food
i
think
ill
stick
to
red
wine
dont
get
me
wrong
it
was
an
enjoyable
beer
just
not
anything
special
appearance
is
a
nice
light
gold
with
an
ivory
head
that
leaves
some
nicely
retentive
lace
aroma
contains
barley
and
hops
alont
with
something
akin
to
tin
initial
taste
is
creamy
and
light
with
honeyed
malt
and
grains
that
settle
down
to
a
dry
tinny
flavor
after
the
hops
add
some
lemon
zest
finish
is
reminiscent
of
sweet
lipton
drink
it
with
food
and
it
might
work
taste
is
grassy
rice
crispness
sparkling
mineral
water
flavors
long
unpleasant
mineral
bitterness
clean
and
crisp
mouth
very
fizzy
overall
unpleasant
little
lager
lots
of
that
mineral
water
bitterness
for
lack
of
a
better
descripter
and
not
enjoyable
on
any
level
i
could
have
done
without
ever
having
drank
this
beer
its
moderatly
drinkable
despite
its
fizzy
body
mostly
because
its
so
plain
it
pours
a
light
golden
colour
in
its
own
moretti
glass
which
was
chilled
in
the
fridge
an
initially
foamy
head
under
my
careful
pour
quickly
retreated
to
my
disappointment
leaving
very
but
not
fiercely
fizzy
body
on
nose
it
had
very
light
lager
malts
and
a
little
hint
of
grassy
note
of
hops
on
palate
again
very
light
malty
flavour
was
underlined
by
a
dash
of
doughy
sourness
finished
with
some
dryish
feel
in
the
mouth
and
nothing
else
overall
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
smooth
for
a
fizzy
and
standard
macro
lager
like
this
but
the
body
is
way
too
flat
and
even
watery
throughout
after
several
sips
i
was
thus
more
than
happy
to
quaff
it
along
with
my
meal
a
thing
i
would
never
do
to
any
beer
i
deemed
enjoyable
in
its
own
right
well
cah
had
some
moretti
glasses
last
night
they
tell
me
that
its
the
larossa
ontap
ha
it
was
this
damned
heineken
clone
my
first
thought
was
heineken
from
the
moment
the
skunkiness
hit
my
nose
then
i
log
on
to
do
my
review
and
there
it
is
associated
with
heineken
right
there
at
the
top
of
window
it
shows
my
notes
say
heineken
with
sugar
for
the
taste
ultrathin
mouthfeel
and
a
fizzy
lazy
finish
not
meant
for
repeat
tasting
cool
logo
and
glass
though
drinkability
i
knew
what
i
was
in
for
when
i
cracked
this
open
and
there
were
no
surprises
a
decent
euro
lager
but
nothing
to
ponder
over
sinkability

when
in
italy
take
the
brunella
over
the
birra
fairly
average
beer
nothing
to
make
it
stand
out
their
doppelbock
rocks
though
a
visiting
buddy
left
this
one
in
my
fridge
and
i
wasnt
that
excited
to
try
it
beat
my
expectations
by
a
little
bit
but
nothing
i
really
want
to
try
again
drinkability
average
brew
not
exceptionnal
not
awful
while
not
one
of
my
favs
this
beer
went
perfect
with
a
piece
of
pizza
it
was
given
to
me
while
sitting
an
a
pizza
parlor
outside
the
vatican
drank
out
of
a
bottle
so
i
cant
say
much
about
the
color
but
the
taste
was
what
an
american
massproduced
lager
bud
pbr
is
supposed
to
taste
like
very
heavy
on
the
wheat
which
gives
it
a
good
grainy
mouthfeel
but
once
swallowed
this
dissipates
almost
instantly
kind
of
a
dry
aftertaste
which
warrents
another
very
enjoyable
for
social
events
when
you
arent
looking
to
examine
for
taste
i
tried
a
bottle
of
this
omnipresent
brew
while
having
a
slice
at
my
local
pizza
parlor
pours
pissy
yellow
white
medium
bubble
head
not
any
aroma
to
comment
on
this
is
as
expected
a
thin
grainy
brew
watery
with
a
hint
of
malt
in
the
background
also
noticed
some
hoppy
dryness
in
the
minimal
finish
typical
unexciting
macro
lager
did
serve
the
purpose
of
washing
the
za
down
but
thats
about
it
l
golden
straw
in
color
clean
with
a
decent
rather
thicck
softwhite
head
light
biscuity
malt
aroma
gets
lost
in
the
stronger
minty
eurohop
smell
light
skunkiness
but
not
too
bad
taste
wheres
the
malt
now
sweetness
faint
cardboard
wafer
flavor
hops
are
better
and
lightly
bitter
vegetal
and
minty
flashes
of
grain
in
the
finish
lightbodied
and
overcarbonated
needs
more
malt
but
not
too
bad
i
have
no
idea
what
birra
morettis
calorie
count
is
but
it
strikes
me
as
a
classic
light
beer
light
in
appearance
light
in
aroma
light
in
flavor
and
light
in
body
if
thats
what
castello
di
udine
was
shooting
for
they
nailed
it
good
for
rehydration
a
pretty
fair
lager
for
what
it
is
nothing
special
though
this
one
poured
out
golden
with
no
head
bits
of
white
that
swirled
up
here
and
there
and
lots
of
carbination
rising
up
crappy
firewaters
for
an
insanely
detergent
laced
glass
can
barely
smell
the
beer
soon
im
going
to
realize
they
are
doing
me
a
favor
barely
get
a
whiff
of
floral
maltiness
giving
it
the
benefit
of
a
doubt
this
bottle
is
well
past
its
prime
freaking
skunky
tasting
as
allhell
very
low
carbination
in
the
taste
especially
for
all
the
bubbles
that
you
see
you
cannot
feel
it
you
get
a
bit
of
caramell
sweetness
bit
of
bitter
hoppiness
are
still
present
but
i
just
keep
thinking
of
roadkill
skunks
swirled
up
into
my
glass
ok
i
managed
to
drink
about
an
inch
into
it
and
even
got
mark
and
karen
to
try
it
god
am
i
cruel
finally
just
asked
the
bartender
to
pour
this
out
not
worth
making
myself
sick
over
to
give
them
credit
i
did
get
a
makeup
beer
from
them
pours
pale
yellow
like
hay
head
not
really
there
are
very
large
bubbles
that
stick
around
for
a
few
seconds
but
barely
a
head
smells
of
wheat
and
alcohol
rather
beery
not
as
much
skunk
as
others
taste
is
a
bit
weak
it
reminds
me
of
a
european
style
lager
made
lite
was
decently
clean
in
mouthfeel
overall
it
was
ok
nothing
special
another
pointless
lager
taking
up
shelf
space
at
my
local
saq
this
is
a
modestly
flaovred
beer
that
is
inoffensive
and
easy
to
drink
its
uncomplex
but
not
bad
final
thought
a
decent
lager
but
there
are
better
ones
at
a
better
price
i
only
purchased
this
because
it
was
on
sale
for
6
99
a
six
when
it
is
usually
9
39
a
six
the
mouthfeel
was
likewise
somewhat
weak
and
thin
an
ok
beer
to
pound
down
a
few
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
it
drinkability
easy
to
drink
all
around
good
beer
when
in
the
north
end
have
the
wine
instead
a
very
average
european
pale
lager
but
better
than
i
expected
based
on
some
unpleasant
experiences
with
italian
brews
in
the
past
this
one
is
quite
drinkable
and
refreshing
albeit
average
for
style
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
nor
would
i
turn
it
down
overall
not
bad
for
an
import
lager
very
easy
drinking
the
crispness
and
supporting
hop
flavor
does
a
nice
job
of
cleasing
the
palate
while
enjoying
italian
fare
specifically
with
red
sauce
or
something
a
little
greasier
like
sausages
although
nothing
spectacular
moretti
is
something
worth
considering
id
choose
this
over
american
mass
produced
stuff
but
thats
about
the
only
time
it
would
really
win
out
with
me
again
not
a
bad
beer
just
not
something
i
enjoyed
a
whole
heck
of
a
lot
drinks
really
well
quicky
fading
head
on
a
transparent
yellow
color
body
the
smell
show
dark
fruits
and
caramel
the
taste
is
malty
and
reminded
me
mostly
of
watery
caramel
nicely
nutty
almost
chestnutty
salted
a
bit
buttery
and
with
a
chewy
hoppiness
the
mouthfeel
is
ok
maybe
a
bit
weak
but
hops
and
chestnuts
combine
enjoyably
on
the
palate
decent
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
mildly
crisp
with
a
fairly
clean
finish
some
sweetness
of
the
malt
lingers
for
a
brief
moment
after
swallowing
slightly
higher
than
average
in
the
drinkability
category
okay
so
italians
are
known
mostly
for
wine
with
the
meals
but
this
beer
does
italians
proud
this
is
what
a
lager
should
taste
like
light
crisp
and
very
refreshing
pours
a
gold
yellow
with
minimal
head
the
smell
is
of
light
grains
and
hops
the
taste
a
light
crisp
blend
of
hops
and
a
little
honey
creamy
for
a
lager
on
a
hot
summer
day
by
the
bbq
this
is
a
great
refreshing
lager
i
strongly
suggest
serving
this
beer
at
your
next
bbq
for
people
you
usually
only
drink
bud
millers
etc
bottle
poured
a
golden
colored
brew
with
almost
no
head
aroma
is
quite
thin
and
almost
nonexistent
taste
is
a
light
mix
of
sweetness
with
some
floral
malt
no
aftertaste
to
speak
of
and
carbonation
is
not
good
body
is
quite
thin
overall
this
is
a
refreshing
lager
that
doesnt
have
much
in
term
of
taste
pours
a
pretty
good
looking
clear
deep
gold
under
a
one
finger
white
head
that
settles
surprisingly
slowly
no
lace
theres
a
bit
of
adjunct
grain
and
metallic
hop
in
the
nose
the
mouth
is
light
and
very
prickly
the
taste
is
surprising
there
is
a
mild
cherry
fruitsweetness
here
to
accompany
a
bit
of
malt
this
is
followed
by
a
very
mild
hoppy
bite
which
intensifies
to
not
quite
bitter
in
the
finish
but
leaves
very
little
aftertaste
a
good
session
beer
definitely
a
session
brew
quite
drinkable
but
by
no
means
a
stand
out
drinkable
medium
bodied
malt
taste
with
a
layer
of
bitter
hops
that
runs
throughout
lasting
light
hop
bready
finish
a
nice
drinkable
lager
i
will
definitely
give
this
brew
another
try
restaurant
lighting
soft
low
incandescent
and
the
frosted
glass
could
have
had
some
effect
on
the
way
i
rated
this
beer

no

just
some
spicy

in
the
finish
with
a
touch

mouthfeel
is
a
bit
high
on
the
carbonation
really
tickles
the
back
of
the
palate
all
the
way
up
to
the
nasopharyngeal
junction
drinkability
not
bad
especially
when
served
cold
suitable
for
a
mainstream
macroeuro
lager
i
must
admit
this
was
far
better
than
i
had
expected
the
bier
tapped
to
a
golden
and
bubbly
presentation
what
little
bit
of
a
head
was
left
for
me
quickly
vanished
into
the
atmosphere
the
aroma
offered
me
a
little
more
in
the
way
of
hops
and
malt
than
i
expected
but
it
was
still
somewhat
metallic
and
the
aroma
overall
was
average
at
best
this
bier
drinks
rather
well
though
light
in
flavor
and
light
on
the
palate
i
can
see
this
one
pairing
very
well
with
any
number
of
italian
dishes
and
being
able
to
stand
up
to
and
cut
through
just
about
anything
not
bad
the
beer
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
pale
malt
scent
that
is
dominated
by
a
breadlike
lager
yeast
smell
the
taste
is
good
it
is
light
but
mildly
malty
with
that
breadlike
finish
it
is
slightly
bitter
and
dry
the
mouthfeel
is
good
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
beer
drinks
quite
well
a
fine
brew
from
italy
this
lager
from
italy
poured
a
ligh
crystal
clear
and
effervescent
golden
color
and
in
both
smell
and
tadte
it
was
about
what
i
expected
a
lightlyhopped
beer
with
citrus
aroma
and
a
thin
smooth
lemony
taste
a
good
complement
for
a
heavy
meal
but
not
a
beer
id
drink
in
and
of
itself
this
is
an
evenly
blended
brew
very
dry
good
on
a
hot
day
i
suppose
i
cant
abide
a
brewerybeer
that
doesnt
try
to
push
the
envelope
somehow
make
it
extra
hoppy
or
extra
malty
or
add
anchoviesdo
something
very
drinkable
this
golden
beer
poured
a
nice
little
head
that
went
away
quickly
the
smell
was
more
reminiscent
of
wine
than
beer
the
taste
was
a
little
more
reminiscent
of
beer
i
had
this
with
some
pizza
and
it
complimented
it
fairly
well
very
little
mouthfeel
to
this
this
was
not
a
beer
really
worth
chasing
down
for
another
taste
overall
this
was
one
of
the
better
pale
lagers
ive
tried
it
went
well
with
the
chicken
and
pasta
with
a
white
sauce
the
beers
taste
and
feel
did
well
to
complement
the
meal
and
it
would
probably
make
for
a
decent
warm
weather
cooler
in
general
i
was
quite
satisfied
with
this
first
introduction
to
italian
beer
ill
admit
ive
come
across
many
beers
from
betterknown
beermaking
nations
that
werent
nearly
as
good
an
ok
beer
in
a
session
light
malt
acidic
yellow
much
carbonation
hoppy
white
bubbly
head
like
your
average
beer
on
tap
at
a
meal
a
abalance
with
food
very
standard
eastern
european
style
beer
but
slightly
better
brewed
than
a
north
american
national
brand
overall
impression
eh
enjoyable
but
mild
put
this
out
to
expose
the
hard
core
bud
lite
drinkers
to
something
different
but
not
exotic
the
prototypical
lager
clear
gold
on
the
pour
with
the
head
average
in
size
bright
white
in
color
frothy
in
texture
and
a
decent
sheet
of
lace
malt
dominates
the
crisp
and
somewhat
sweet
nose
start
is
lightly
sweet
top
a
bit
thin
for
my
taste
finish
is
prickly
in
its
acidity
hops
are
apropos
to
the
style
aftertaste
quite
dry
and
long
lasting
much
less
flashy
than
a
lot
of
other
beers
though
this
isnt
always
a
bad
thing
completely
drinkable
perhaps
good
for
just
kicking
back
and
relaxing
really
bad
aftertaste
i
think
i
still
taste
it
today
overall
i
prefer
this
over
italys
other
main
macro
peroni
although
this
beer
isnt
all
that
exciting
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
crafted
a
little
bit
better
than
peroni
and
the
brown
bottling
doesnt
hurt
either
good
hot
weather
beer
plus
i
wouldnt
mind
trying
this
with
some
pasta
if
i
ever
get
the
chance
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
a
friend
brought
a
six
pack
over
for
a
barbeque
we
were
having
this
beer
complimented
the
grilled
chicken
quite
well
pours
out
to
a
darkish
yellow
in
the
glass
with
a
decent
head
aroma
is
that
of
grains
but
it
also
has
a
floral
smell
as
well
that
is
really
good
this
beer
tastewise
reminds
me
of
beers
from
the
czech
republich
i
e
budvar
pilsner
urquell
rebel
etc
but
might
be
even
more
balanced
a
very
surprising
beer
and
one
i
will
pick
up
again
i
must
say
this
has
got
to
be
one
of
my
favourite
brews
it
pours
a
light
golden
colour
and
has
a
delicate
snow
white
head
about
it
the
head
is
a
little
quick
to
dissipate
to
a
light
white
haze
over
the
surface
that
i
would
hesitate
to
still
call
the
head
delicate
lacing
of
the
glass
and
a
soft
clean
smell
if
that
makes
any
sence
at
all
thats
the
only
way
i
know
how
to
describe
it
the
taste
is
quite
good
indeed
likewise
the
mouthfeel
is
also
pleasant
this
beer
isnt
at
all
aggresive
and
has
a
nice
finish
with
a
pleasant
aftertaste
i
have
trouble
describing
as
i
mentioned
before
this
is
indeed
one
of
my
favourite
brews
and
i
could
drink
these
light
weight
italians
all
night
long
they
also
go
well
with
italian
cuisine
a
nice
veal
parmesan
accompanied
by
a
cool
pint
of
moretti
is
quite
tasty
i
actually
liked
this
beer
went
nice
with
my
meal
pasta
and
very
easy
to
drink
price
is
a
little
high
for
this
style
but
a
better
alternative
if
you
are
antibigbrewer
but
like
this
style
i
credit
the
greatness
of
this
beer
to
the
fact
that
friuli
was
once
ruled
by
the
hapsburgs
it
should
be
compared
to
other
great
beers
from
that
empire
such
as
pilsner
budweijc
and
vienna

hop
balance
swallow
is
a
little
unsettling
too
much
carbonation
and
some
vague
phenolics
that
lean
on
the
metallic
side
to
my
mind
too
sharp
at
the
close
due
to
the
finishing
effects
12
oz
bottle
poured
a
golden
yellow
with
a
big
head
that
slowly
receded
no
real
lacing
is
evident
aroma
is
of
malt
and
hops
taste
is
slightly
sweet
with
some
bitterness
of
the
hops
in
the
finish
seems
just
like
any
other
fizzy
yellow
beer
not
bad
but
nothing
great
not
a
beer
i
would
actively
seekout
but
it
was
the
best
beer
offered
at
magianos
i
would
have
no
problem
drinking
it
again
pours
a
crystal
clear
gold
with
a
generous
white
head
fairly
retentive
head
with
decent
lacing
down
the
glass
the
nose
is
malty
with
hops
overlay
the
flavors
are
mostly
of
the
malt
with
some
notes
of
grain
little
bittering
to
balance
the
malt
body
slighty
thin
and
watery
body
this
is
a
clean
refreshing
and
drinkable
beer
with
little
to
recommend
it
over
dozens
of
other
pale
lager
style
beers
drinkabilitynotes
a
simple
but
pleasing
beer
that
i
think
would
compliment
spicy
foods
very
easy
to
drink
it
was
just
like
any
other
lager
of
it
type
it
poured
a
light
golden
yellow
with
little
foam
the
aroma
was
the
same
as
all
other
your
lagers
of
this
type
but
this
is
the
better
of
the
italian
beers
little
on
the
bitter
side
but
refreshing
and
interesting
taste
i
would
serve
it
to
my
friends
that
dont
know
the
difference
any
light
color
lager
is
great
to
them
was
introduced
to
this
beer
at
a
special
tasting
on
tap
at
a
local
pub
but
the
review
comes
from
the
bottled
version
this
beer
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
thin
white
head
that
leaves
little
lace
on
the
glass
the
aroma
was
nice
but
nothing
special
the
taste
of
this
beer
is
very
good
for
its
classification
very
satisfying
and
enjoyable
ive
found
the
only
problem
with
this
beer
is
that
it
becomes
skunky
very
quickly
so
be
careful
if
youre
having
it
out
of
the
bottle
a
nice
golden
color
with
some
fizzy
carbonation
and
a
very
thin
pathy
head
aroma
is
faint
some
wheat
and
hops
can
be
detected
a
slight
grainy
and
malt
combined
taste
off
the
top
a
little
touch
of
spicy
hops
very
little
are
noted
through
the
body
a
somewhat
bland
beer
that
lacks
any
decent
characteristics
i
was
hoping
for
more
flavor
and
taste
i
had
this
with
a
pizza
here
in
greensboro
at
elizabeths
pizzalight
goldyellow
color
with
small
head
smell
of
hops
with
malt
backbone
taste
was
pretty
decent
good
balancea
little
fruity
nothing
spectacular
but
very
drinkablebetter
than
miller
lowlife
and
ab
products
the
smell
is
ok
a
little
sharp
but
i
was
ready
for
that
nothing
that
is
going
to
turn
me
off
this
beer
little
head
kind
of
flat
and
a
pale
yellow
colour
the
apperarance
is
even
worse
if
you
count
the
goofy
looking
guy
on
the
label
with
the
fur
growing
on
him
taste
is
somewhat
sweet
and
goes
down
easy
making
this
a
good
session
beer
f
this
was
my
first
taste
of
an
italian
beer
i
tried
it
in
london
england
while
eating
pasta
in
a
small
italian
restaurant
called
delartista
it
was
the
one
bere
they
had
and
i
must
say
that
i
enjoyed
it
i
thought
that
it
was
probably
a
mixture
of
the
bere
and
atmosphere
so
i
just
tried
it
again
back
in
canada
again
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
the
overall
taste
i
would
definetally
drink
it
again
slightly
dark
straw
color
with
active
carbonation
and
a
barely
offwhite
head
of
average
volume
and
persistence
pours
completely
clear
light
grainy
smell
with
a
touch
of
hops
quite
pleasant
though
not
so
strong
sweet
from
start
to
finish
though
the
texture
gets
somehow
fuller
and
the
taste
more
honeylike
toward
the
end
too
syrupysweet
to
enjoy
in
quantity
but
a
nice
beer
nonetheless
very
light
golden
colour
not
much
of
head
on
this
beer
i
found
it
to
be
nicely
hopped
more
than
a
generic
macro
lager
but
less
than
a
classic
european
pils
ie
urquell
kozel
etc
still
quite
an
easy
drinking
beer
that
is
average
and
drinkable
but
not
great
by
an
stretch
of
the
imagination
i
would
have
to
try
this
beer
again
in
order
to
give
it
a
fair
shake
i
had
a
few
before
my
first
sample
pours
a
semiclear
golden
yellow
color
with
a
thin
white
head
that
fades
into
a
thin
sticky
lace
fairly
light
and
clean
aroma
with
notes
of
sweet
grains
and
spicy
hops
taste
is
light
and
crisp
with
flavors
of
fresh
grains
raw
honey
and
a
bit
of
citrus
mild
bite
of
spicy
hops
in
the
finish
a
nice
brew
that
cries
out
for
a
big
plate
of
spicy
pasta
consumed

the
appearance
is
a
bright
and
clear
yellow
straw
color
the
head
is
frothy
white
in
color
somewhat
creamy
the
settles
to
decent
lace
on
the
nose
the
aroma
is
slightly
grainy
and
slightly
grassy
on
the
palate
grainy
husk
flavors
grassy
dryness
sharp
mouthfeel
very
soft
citrus
bite
slight
sweetness
underlying
bitterness
dry
and
crisp
but
there
is
nothing
that
really
makes
you
jump
out
of
your
seat
decent
though
a
good
euro
lager
that
is
hard
to
say
anything
bad
about
its
not
great
or
outstanding
in
any
way
just
a
good
beer
i
have
always
loved
this
beer
great
with
italian
food
and
when
you
are
thirsty
nice
crisp
lager
style
done
very
well
much
better
than
many
lagers
from
the
states
crisp
corn
taste
i
visited
italy
this
summer
and
i
like
most
people
wanted
to
enjoy
pasta
and
pizza
with
beer
i
tried
this
beer
with
pizza
and
pasta
and
i
have
to
admitt
i
really
enjoyed
it
as
soon
as
i
came
back
to
cyprus
i
looked
for
it
and
found
it
in
some
italic
restaurants
quite
nice
appearance
cant
really
tell
the
taste
since
i
only
tasted
this
beer
with
food
drinkability
45
especially
when
really
cold
i
always
order
this
at
reginas
when
i
am
eating
pizza
it
really
has
no
taste
almost
like
a
light
beer
yellow
color
it
looks
watered
down
in
the
glass
with
very
little
head
no
bad
after
taste
and
it
does
not
seem
to
battle
the
taste
of
the
food
who
would
drink
wine
with
pizza
anyways
nice
golden
color
a
vigorous
pour
produces
a
fine
head
which
leaves
a
fine
lace
down
the
glass
smells
of
grain
and
malt
and
a
bit
of
hops
tastes
ok
euro
grain
and
malt
flavors
abound
with
a
dry
and
crisp
finish
after
a
somewhat
smooth
mouthfeel
an
average
beer
but
i
would
imagine
it
would
be
a
good
choice
to
wash
down
some
delicious
italian
dish
i
looked
forward
to
trying
this
brew
as
with
other
italian
offerings
what
impressed
me
most
with
thisone
was
its
appearance
its
pure
yellow
goldvery
clear
body
while
topped
with
a
frothy
creampuff
pillow
that
settled
down
to
lace
about
average
its
a
above
average
in
carbonation
while
the
taste
is
not
weak
but
more
mellow
it
lacks
a
crisp
bite
anyways
with
pasta
pizza
you
dont
want
to
overpower
the
sauce
making
this
a
good
companion
it
was
good
not
great
but
definitely
worth
trying
kick
of
carbonation
and
a
nice
malt
flavor
were
the
most
noticeable
traits
of
this
one
it
went
down
great
and
stood
up
to
fierce
competition
on
a
sampling
night
a
very
average
and
typical
italian
lager
tastes
not
unlike
peroni
clear
very
carbonated
with
a
decent
malt
flavor
a
very
drinkable
brew
goes
down
smoothly
with
not
much
else
to
speak
of
the
guy
on
the
label
looks
kinda
cool
though
hmmm
where
to
begin
well
i
am
going
from
memory
of
last
night
but
well
i
do
remember
being
pretty
disappointed
with
this
brew
here
it
goes
this
beer
is
very
carbonated
the
first
thing
that
hits
you
is
the
pitter
patter
of
its
bubbles
hitting
off
you
palate
similiar
to
that
of
pop
rocks
figuretivly
its
a
nice
novelty
for
the
first
few
sips
but
once
that
wears
off
you
realize
that
what
you
have
in
your
hand
is
a
boring
beer
the
taste
is
nothing
really
worth
commenting
on
or
berating
its
a
little
bitter
with
a
slight
creaminess
to
it
i
do
not
want
to
anger
anyone
by
saying
this
but
well
to
me
this
beer
is
the
italian
corona
flavorless
and
no
where
near
worth
what
it
costs
clear
light
golden
in
color
with
a
bright
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
fast
rising
tiny
bubbles
add
to
the
appearance
the
aroma
is
richly
malty
with
a
very
light
spicy
hop
in
the
background
the
body
is
medium
with
a
very
fine
highly
effervescent
carbonation
the
flavor
offers
a
very
nice
rich
maltiness
thats
well
backed
by
grassy
spicy
hops
leaving
a
short
dry
finish
with
a
gently
lingering
maltiness
and
bitterness
well
balanced
with
an
interesting
malt
character
just
a
notch
above
awful
for
every
category
sweetish
and
bland
fizzy
and
yellow
and
overall
pretty
much
a
snoozefest
no
character
at
all
their
la
rossa
is
much
better
crystal

thin
fizzy

last
for

well

crisp
light

lots
of
snappy

taste
bitterness
was
right
on
for
a
european
pilsener
light
bodied
not
much
malt
to
notice
more
of
a
grainy
finish
nothing
lingers
to
long
overall
crisp
and
refreshing
i
would
order
it
an
italian
restuarant
decent
retention
with
a
sticky
white
lace
nearly
clean
aroma
with
a
trace
of
overcooked
hop
and
husky
sweet
grain
crispness
gets
lost
within
the
grainy
mouth
feel
big
grass
almost
earthened
flavour
from
the
grain
with
a
sturdy
yet
underlying
hop
bitterness
decent
beer
all
around
seems
to
go
better
with
pasta
in
a
heavy
cream
sauce
rather
than
the
typical
red
gravy
birra
morreti
from
the
bottle
the
color
was
a
standard
ambergolden
euro
lager
this
beer
had
a
slightly
unusual
odor
almost
like
the
metal
copper
this
was
very
much
a
light
in
body
eurolager
with
slight
malt
flavor
toward
the
finish
and
in
the
aftertaste
hops
became
much
more
pronounced
no
doubt
to
compete
with
italian
food
not
a
bad
accompaniment
to
an
italian
dish
straw
yellow
color
with
a
creamy
head
not
much
in
the
way
of
its
weak

aroma
weak
and
watery
flavor
of
malts
and
hops
that
was
dry
clean
and
boring
nothing
offensive
bit
of
hops
at
the
end

very
flat
thin
and
dull
overall
slight
malt
nose
very
light
gold
color
with
a
white
head
slightly
smooth
maly
mouth
the
taste
is
one
of
a
solid
malt
presence
it
does
not
have
alot
of
punch
but
it
is
balenced
enough
on
the
hops
presence
side
great
with
cheese
olives
and
bread
this
is
a
better
than
average
pilsener
but
its
nothing
spectacular
it
has
a
decent
white
head
that
sticks
to
the
side
of
the
glass
and
a
decent
malt
flavor
if
youre
out
for
dinner
and
want
something
italian
order
some
barbaresco
barolo
or
chianti
the
italians
do
wine
better
than
beer

amber
with
small
head
slighty
hoppy
but
with
more
malt
sweetness
very
fizzy
goes
down
fairly
smooth
malty
with
a
definate
hop
edge
slight
fruit
on
the
nose
seems
overly
carbonated
but
not
bad
slightly
sour
with
a
light
aftertaste
rare
in
the
states
it
seems
i
agree
with
todd
this
is
better
with
a
meal
than
sipping
alone
not
outstanding
but
overall
a
pleasant
beer
to
me
it
almost
has
a
slight
melon
flavor
leaning
toward
apple
i
wouldnt
buy
this
at
a
store
to
take
home
but
if
its
on
the
menu
at
the
italian
place
ill
order
it
notes
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
it
lacks
the
crispness
of
say
a
peroni
but
is
still
quite
enjoyable
its
also
the
morettis
flagship
beer
id
pair
this
with
a
nice
italian
dish
vs
drinking
it
on
its
own
cool
bottle
but
hardly
stuff
of
the
gods
barely
better
than
the
usual
faux
lager
first
sip
in
santorini
may
2005
with
mai
shipp
debby
this
drinks
like
so
many
pilsner
styles
from
europe
with
a
bit
of
cracker
rice
light
cereal
malt
and
that
all
too
often
skunk
easy
to
drink
to
the
point
of
watery
its
a
decent
pairing
with
a
gyro
only
remotely
decent
thing
about
this
beer
is
the
look
better
than
budweiser
or
miller
lite
im
not
a
fan
of
american
pale
or
india
pales
so
this
was
a
pleasant
change
first
two
sips
i
didnt
like
a
bit
ashy
but
ended
up
enjoying
the
way
it
went
down
not
too
bitter
not
too
heavy
glad
i
had
bought
two
the
taste
gets
better
and
better
unappealing
pale
yellow
colour
tastes
faintly
of
cigarette
ash
probably
more
enjoyable
in
a
hotter
climate
taste
was
sweet
no
bitterness
was
fairly
smooth
to
drink
and
a
teeny
bit
strong
too
recommended
overall
another
cheap
euro
lager
that
doesnt
really
make
the
grade
on
aroma
flavour
or
feel
there
are
better
lagers
for
less
than
45
a
case
too
enjoy
palate
a
light
bodied
beer
with
medium
carbonation
a
different
flavor
of
a
lager
i
would
drink
this
again
bottle
at
the
macon
ga
greek
festival
pours
yellow
with
a
white
head
aroma
of
hops
grain
and
grass
tastes
of
grass
grain
and
very
slightly
floral
light
bodied
and
refreshing
went
well
with
my
spankopita
and
dolmada
opa
luckily
i
was
served
a
bottle
that
had
not
skunked
yet
not
much
there
to
taste
otherwise
cold
grainy
fizz
to
wash
down
some
fried
smelt
in
that
sense
i
have
no
complaints
a
few
years
since
ive
had
this
one
this
time
it
was
the
only
local
bottled
beer
in
a
restaurant
in
oia
santorini
i
found
it
hard
to
finish
and
it
had
a
funny
aftertaste
so
not
a
beer
ill
be
revisiting
anytime
soon
sat
alfresco
eating
olives
and
potato
chips
drinking
this
beer
in
greece
pretty
enjoyable
not
great
reminiscent
of
gennesee
cream
ale
maybe
it
was
because
of
the
green
can
too
basic
mass
produced
generic
lager
from
greece
had
this
poured
out
of
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
in
santorini
the
appearance
is
actually
quite
inviting
it
pours
a
consistent
golden
yellow
with
little
head
very
crisp
look
to
it
the
taste
is
a
little
sour
its
basically
the
beer
they
have
in
most
bars
in
greece
thats
easy
to
get
the
nose
isnt
so
hot
smells
a
little
sweet
which
was
strange
not
so
hot
b
this
isnt
horrible
but
it
wont
break
down
any
doors
drinkable
and
mostly
unoffensive
pours
a
light
golden
amber
with
a
quite
nice
one
finger
pure
white
head
with
good
retention
and
lacing
aroam
on
opening
of
pure
skunk
with
light
sweet
malt
and
hints
of
grassy
hops
underneath
after
sitting
in
the
glass
a
more
typical
euro
pale
adjunct
light
sweet
malt
and
grain
aroma
flavor
of
subdued
sweet
malt
starting
with
faint
biscuit
malt
and
developing
a
bit
more
sweet
malt
finishing
light
with
a
hint
of
hop
bitterness
light
to
medium
bodied
very
lightly
flavored
but
did
not
seem
watered
down
simply
lightly
malted
the
flavors
that
are
present
are
quite
nice
but
really
does
not
stand
out
in
any
way
a
mild
simple
pale
ale
good
and
unobtrusive
with
a
meal
not
my
style
but
pleasant
enough
green
bottle
booo
o
average
lager
more
hop
character
than
an
aal
but
mass
produced
and
made
for
chugging
just
how
most
of
europe
like
their
beer
i
bought
this
greek
beer
at
the
friar
tucks
in
savoy
illinois
it
pours
fizzy
yellow
with
two
fingers
sized
white
head
and
plenty
of
lacings
and
carbonation
it
has
relatively
little
aroma
a
metallic
taste
with
strong
notes
of
malt
and
wheat
it
has
a
light
body
with
no
edge
or
bite
malt
after
taste
and
is
not
filling
got
this
bottle
from
a
co
worker
who
was
ranting
and
raving
about
this
beer
we
definitely
have
different
tastes
in
beer
and
this
is
just
a
nasty
brew
very
generic
watery
taste
taste
like
an
over
produced
beer
not
ranking
much
higher
than
a
domestic
in
my
book
never
again
adjunct
lager
all
the
way
what
can
ya
say
washed
down
a
meal
at
a
local
greek
diner
well
enough
but
not
much
going
on
beyond
that
alright
beer
overall
but
not
worth
expensive
price
light
in
taste
and
together
with
teh
carbonation
makes
it
a
great
refreshment
but
thats
just
it
no
more
to
it
overall
this
is
really
good
compared
to
some
of
the
euro
lagers
the
price
on
this
one
has
exploded
from
8
99
to
11
99
for
a
mere
six
pack
which
is
absolutely
nuts
not
sure
what
to
think
anymore
other
then
going
in
a
different
direction
until
they
wise
up
and
bring
the
price
down
its
nothing
special
but
nothing
bad
about
it
either
i
enjoyed
it
overall
a
pretty
bad
beer
even
by
euro
lager
standards
terrible
flavor
and
mouthfeel
not
one
i
recommend
to
the
point
i
didnt
like
this
beer
on
the
first
couple
of
sips
the
more
i
sipped
the
more
l
liked
it
it
still
is
only
an
okay
lager
but
on
a
hot
summer
day
and
it
is
today
it
is
refreshing
if
nothing
else
and
looking
at
those
flavors
i
mean
nothing
else
not
bad
if
it
is
used
as
a
summer
thirst
quencher
actually
it
gets
better
as
it
warms
up
and
it
has
no
offflavors
oi
was
at
a
greek
restaurant
that
i
enjoy
next
time
i
know
to
order

then
dominated
by
the

there
is
some
citric

at

would
say
this
is
a
good
beer
if
you
are
gonna
eat
mousaka
this
is
fairly
inoffensive
doesnt
do
any
harm
i
have
a
feeling
this
is
a
context
beer
this
might
fit
a
little
better
in
the
context
of
my
towns
huge
greek
food
festival
in
june
in
the
context
of
sitting
in
my
home
on
a
january
evening
drank
with
a
critical
eye
it
doesnt
really
hold
up
that
said
if
given
no
alternative
i
could
drink
several
of
these
not
be
any
worse
for
wear
this
is
an
allmalt
greenbottled
euro
lager
from
greece
so
its
a
rarity
of
sorts
it
is
an
exceptionally
clear
pale
yellow
with
a
solid
white
lacing
this
lager
brings
a
hint
of
cooked
corn
and
hops
with
a
side
of
grassiness
in
the
nose
it
gives
a
smooth
and
refreshing
mouthfeel
this
beer
has
a
hint
of
sweetness
but
a
dry
malt
palate
throughout
dried
grass
comes
to
mind
with
a
bit
of
bread
as
well
the
hops
show
more
bitterness
than
flavor
and
some
cooked
veggie
flavors
show
up
in
the
dry
finish
this
lager
has
a
bit
more
life
compared
to
the
typical
fizzy
yellow
lager
this
one
is
worth
a
go
but
the
eagles
are
getting
asses
handed
tothem
and
the
packers
look
unrelenting
so
my
good
mood
has
changed
and
the
beer
is
backto
what
it
is
water
easy
drinking
lager
better
than
most
of
the
italian
lagers
i
tried
drinkability
quite
good
for
accompanying
a
simple
meal
after
trying
it
alone
i
had
it
with
a
roast
chicken
and
ovencooked
potatoes
i
could
drink
a
couple
not
that
it
thrills
me
but
its
not
insulting
in
any
way
either
pours
a
golden
straw
color
with
a
minimal
white
head
that
fades
quickly
without
much
lacing
no
lacing
in
the
end
the
nose
is
ligh
grain
and
some
german
helles
characteristics
its
too
bad
skunked
hops
cover
everything
up
feel
is
light
and
skunky
with
high
carbonation
i
could
not
finish
this
one
nothing
noteworthy
with
this
insipid
brew
while
not
a
light
beer
it
certainly
called
to
mind
bud
light
rather
thin
body
sweet
adjunct
malt
and
light
hopping
this
is
my
first
from
a
greek
brewery
and
i
hope
those
in
that
country
have
better
choices
than
this
d
decently
drinkable
but
nothing
fantastic
i
was
in
a
greek
restaurant
and
ordered
this
because
it
was
on
the
menu
i
was
not
at
all
familiar
with
this
beer
brought
to
me
in
a
12
oz
bottle
with
pint
glass
poured
very
clear
mildy
yellow
very
bubbly
lots
of
fizz
on
top
that
settled
quickly
into
no
head
lots
of
carbonation
no
lacing
to
speak
of
i
took
a
big
whiff
and
had
a
hard
time
getting
a
real
good
sense
of
the
smell
not
a
bad
smell
just
very
mild
some
sweet
aroma
no
hops
to
speak
of
the
taste
was
well
nonexistent
i
was
really
trying
to
get
a
good
handle
on
the
taste
but
it
had
no
taste
i
only
got
a
hint
of
malty
sweetness
no
aftertaste
no
bitterness
light
fizzy
mouthfeel
i
suppose
this
could
be
considered
drinkable
because
of
the
very
mild
flavor
and
light
mouthfeel
i
could
probably
drink
a
dozen
of
these
with
all
my
facilities
fully
in
check
i
suppose
id
drink
this
again
but
not
at
disney
world
prices
which
is
what
i
paid
because
i
didnt
know
any
better
note
my
wife
asked
why
i
didnt
check
ba
on
my
phone
before
ordering
the
beer
not
a
bad
lager
it
has
a
good
amount
of
flavor
and
isnt
very
watery
it
has
a
dry
finish
but
very
slight
sweetness
when
going
down
d
average
beer
glad
i
tried
it
especially
since
i
was
at
the
greek
festival
drinkability
is
not
bad
cold
this
one
is
fairly
refreshing
but
id
rather
drink
one
of
the
other
euro
lagers
while
here
in
greece
drink
this
in
greece
maybe
its
nostalgia
talking
but
the
american
import
lacks
the
depth
of
the
greek
offering
d
a
somewhat
drinkable
beer
if
you
feel
adventurous
i
wouldnt
make
it
a
regular
thing
though
overall
this
could
have
been
better
but
it
is
what
it
is
right
surprising
sure
it
wont
pull
greece
out
of
bankruptcy
but
mythos
would
make
a
good
companion
with
greekmediterranean
cuisine
overall
glad
i
tried
it
but
nothing
special
or
unique
about
this
beer
compared
to
a
dozen
other
lager
beers
that
you
run
into
definitely
not
a
beer
i
would
seek
out
or
probably
try
again
i
enjoyed
having
this
beer
at
the
greek
festival
i
attended
and
it
paired
very
well
with
the
gyro
i
drank
it
with
drinkability
light
and
refreshing
but
the
grain
thing
is
just
too
much
for
me
ill
not
seek
this
one
out
again
i
think
this
is
an
average
lager
has
the
typical
pale
color
thin
feel
to
it
not
much
of
a
head
taste
was
average
but
i
didnt
notice
the
skunkiness
other
reviewers
mention
just
a
bit
of
graininess
some
citrus
taste
also
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
it
went
well
with
a
greek
dinner
seems
similar
to
other
euro
pale
lagers
but
without
as
much
of
a
skunky
aroma
like
heineken
md
thin
and
watery
but
it
has
some
kinda
feel
that
makes
it
reasonably
smooth
the
tiniest
bit
viscous
chugable
drinkability
this
beer
is
definitely
easy
to
drink
it
went
well
with
my
greek
meal
and
allinall
it
was
a
decent
beer
its
weakness
is
the
flavor
that
bitter
aftertaste
is
not
all
that
desirable
and
i
like
a
beer
that
has
a
little
taste
at
the
end
i
would
however
certainly
drink
it
again
in
short
unexciting
macro
greek
style
d
better
than
a
macro
like
budweiser
or
miller
but
still
only
a
slight
notch
above
the
smell
is
not
very
inviting
but
more
like
hmmm
wonder
if
this
tastes
i
must
say
for
a
warm
day
as
today
in
holland
every
beer
tastes
as
long
as
its
served
cold
during
the
tasting
the
beer
is
actually
not
bad
at
all
far
away
some
citruslike
fruitsmell
the
greeks
invented
a
lot
of
things
but
beer
was
not
one
of
them
going
by
this
national
brand
they
evidently
have
no
claim
to
having
perfected
it
either
and
apparently
theyre
not
too
familiar
with
the
concept
of
uv
rays
i
rather
like
this
beer
but
the
green
bottle
has
got
to
go
if
it
ever
has
a
chance
at
being
a
truly
palatable
pleasurable
lager
had
a
mythos
tonight
with
my
greek
food
at
skara
grill
in
wr
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pilsner
style
glass
decent
sized
head
forms
a
bit
darker
shade
of
yellow
than
most
macro
lagers
plenty
of
carbonation
smell
was
pretty
average
mostly
corn
taste
was
actually
decent
noticeable
amount
of
malt
and
a
clean
and
crisp
aftertaste
mouthfeel
was
bubbly
and
smooth
drinkability
gets
decent
marks
in
my
opinion
as
i
have
had
much
worse
i
think
this
is
a
decent
choice
to
pair
with
a
cuisine
better
than
some
mexican
or
asian
lagers
i
have
tried
to
pair
with
dinner
definitely
preferred
this
ice
cold
when
it
came
to
the
table
reminded
me
of
my
honeymoon
in
greece
where
mythos
was
drunk
everywhere
so
maybe
i
am
partial
to
this
beer
d
light
in
body
and
flavor
so
not
hard
to
drink
easy
to
drink
in
warm
surroundings
when
served
really
cold
overallinoffensive
lager
id
call
it
more
of
a
euro
pale
than
a
helles
by
its
profile
not
too
impressive
d
eminently
drinkable
i
downed
pints
of
this
during
my
trip
to
greece
seems
to
be
the
national
beer
if
greece
a
very
easy
unoffensive
lager
d
goes
down
easily
not
filling
ok
tasting
i
would
have
others
of
the
style
before
opting
for
this
one
doffered
this
where
there
were
no
alternatives
i
wouldnt
refuse
to
drink
it
again
but
i
would
sure
wonder
why
there
are
no
alternatives
drinkablebarely
this
is
a
fine
lager
beer
for
a
day
of
recovery
after
the
ridiculousness
of
hard
liver
a
monstrous
foam
attempts
to
peak
above
the
rim
of
the
glass
but
i
play
defense
and
prevent
it
from
assaulting
my
counter
it
appears
innocuous
the
color
of
an
irish
plucked
eyebrowline
malty
aromas
very
little
hop
presence
an
interesting
yeast
profile
it
is
all
malt
and
yeast
in
this
one
and
the
flavor
is
pretty
one
dimensional
for
me
though
today
it
is
the
perfect
beer
to
make
sure
that
barley
wines
have
not
wrecked
my
palate
forever
thanks
greece
opa
drinkability
wont
have
again
a
light
body
and
only
a
bit
crisp
on
the
tongue
overall
i
wasnt
really
impressed
by
anything
about
this
beer
the
taste
fell
flat
for
the
most
part
and
it
wasnt
as
crisp
as
i
would
have
liked
i
think
some
american
counterparts
would
have
been
more
refreshing
and
satisfying
than
this
d
the
best
part
of
the
beer
is
the
drinkability
it
goes
down
smooth
but
with
enough
character
to
remind
you
that
you
are
drinking
a
quality
made
euro
beer
and
not
anything
else
this
is
a
pretty
standard
beer
but
the
first
ive
tried
from
greece
they
put
a
nice
spin
on
the
style
though
if
i
must
say
try
a
bottle
and
youll
see
worthy
of
a
try
at
least
true
to
the
style
it
is
boring
somehow
it
deserves
to
lose
some
points
for
the
lack
of
distinguishing
characteristics
yet
as
i
said
it
doesnt
do
anything
wrong

d
this
could
work
on
a
warm
greek
beach
in
summertime
in
cold
wintery
sweden
in
midjanuary
i
dont
think
so
in
reinforcing
opinions
from
3
others
i
proceeded
to
dump
the
remainder
of
the
bottle
file
this
one
under
the
typical
euro
macrolager
category
for
mediocre
beer
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
this
is
the
first
greek
beer
ive
ever
had
for
their
sake
i
hope
they
have
many
others
too
choose
from
d
nothing
special
about
this
beer
and
the
grainyness
was
to
apparent
drinkability
easy
to
down
with
a
solid
taste
i
would
imagine
this
being
a
sort
of
pbr
of
greece
or
something
in
the
sense
of
each
countries
lager
standards
good
appearance
typical
for
an
adjunct
smell
was
sweet
and
seemed
like
it
might
have
been
just
a
little
skunked
not
sure
if
this
is
normal
for
this
beer
but
i
am
looking
at
the
green
bottle
disapprovingly
taste
is
about
what
you
would
expect
for
an
adjunct
lager
clean
and
crisp
but
a
little
watery
mouthfeel
is
appropriate
but
drinkability
is
definitely
lacking
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
sweet
fruity
and
spritzy
it
actually
is
like
a
light
champagne
smooth
beer
that
could
use
some
more
bubbles
it
seems
that
some
more
co2
would
give
that
little
bit
more
acidity
and
sharpen
the
faint
traces
of
hops
a
good
one
ice
cold
on
a
hot
day
in
greece
but
id
be
more
inclined
to
cook
with
it
rather
then
struggle
to
drink
a
sixer
t
kind
of
a
smokey
pilsner
taste
with
some
sweet
caramel
flavoring
despite
its
overall
rating
this
is
a
solid
beer
nothing
special
but
nothing
bad
funky
my
first
greek
beer
it
was
about
what
was
expected
its
pretty
drinkable
maybe
at
a
summer
party
when
youre
not
thinking
too
much
about
what
youre
drinking
in
all
aspects
it
reminds
me
a
lot
of
other
european
lagers
but
i
wouldnt
reach
for
it
over
others
like
heineken
or
grolsch
its
worth
a
try
just
to
say
youve
had
it
but
thats
about
it
d
good
especially
in
this
hot
greek
summer
definitely
overcarbonated
it
reminds
me
of
the
beer
from
utica
club
or
geneseejust
another
national
macro
this
time
from
greece
drinkability
not
too
good
but
im
sure
itd
taste
better
under
the
proper
conditions
still
i
remember
tasting
this
long
ago
and
not
being
impressed
forgettable
great
restaurant
bad
beer
overall
this
is
a
pretty
underwhelming
beer
i
hope
it
isnt
representative
of
the
entire
style
poured
from
a
green
bottle
into
a
weizen
glass
has
a
gold
color
with
a
1
inch
head
aroma
is
mild
and
sweet
taste
is
crisp
and
malty
with
some
sweetness
feels
great
in
the
mouth
and
goes
down
very
easily
overall
i
found
this
to
be
an
enjoyable
beer
its
an
interesting
if
underwhelming
and
fairly
typical
beer
d
paired
decently
with
the
shawarma
i
was
having
but
it
didnt
have
any
unique
flavors
to
pique
my
interest
its
fairly
forgettable
but
fairly
drinkable
too
there
isnt
a
whole
lot
of
character
here
but
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
something
inoffensive
on
a
hot
day
you
may
reach
for
this
overall
this
tastes
like
a
bad
german
pilsener
but
really
it
just
smacks
of
poor
brewing
not
tasty
and
not
refreshing
not
much
to
recommend
tastes
a
lot
like
a
heineken
refreshing
and
lightbodied
with
a
bit
of
creamy
mouthfeel
overall
smoother
and
easier
to
drink
than
a
heiney
none
of
the
skunkysour
aftertaste
that
you
can
sometimes
get
not
bad
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
either
good
with
a
gyro
but
what
wouldnt
be
if
you
need
to
drink
beer
fast
this
is
a
candidate
very
forgetable
i
drank
this
beer
everyday
in
greece
and
for
a
beach
beer
this
is
a
lot
better
and
cheaper
than
corona
or
a
lot
of
other
lighter
macro
lagers
this
beer
did
not
meet
my
expectations
overall
meh
ive
had
better
and
worse
final
thoughts
though
nothing
special
this
beer
was
fun
to
try
from
the
greek
market
for
an
authentic
greek
night
on
the
good
side
this
beer
does
have
a
nice
easy
drinkablity
and
mouthfeel
it
a
little
watery
but
does
not
weight
very
much
on
the
pallete
overall
not
offensive
by
any
means
but
kind
of
bland
a
little
drink
this
cold
because
i
found
it
the
taste
deteriorates
as
it
warms
my
scores
are
based
solely
on
the
4
7
bottle
but
i
descrbied
both
for
reference
the
beer
pours
a
pale
gold
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
nice
pilsner
and
munich
malt
scent
thats
a
bit
sweet
along
with
a
nice
german
hop
aroma
the
taste
is
average
it
has
a
crisp
pilsner
malt
flavor
that
goes
down
with
some
prickly
carbonation
it
has
a
german
hop
presence
and
a
green
bottle
skunkiness
to
it
the
mouthfeel
is
average
it
is
a
low
bodied
beer
with
too
much
carbonation
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
however
im
not
inclined
to
buy
anymore
d
at
just
4
7
this
paired
very
well
with
the
stronger
flavors
of
the
lebanese
cuisine
i
made
sure
to
have
at
least
34
sips
before
the
food
arrived
stealthily
scrawled
some
notes
then
compared
once
the
food
and
beer
met
up
a
satisfying
example
of
the
style
would
have
again
in
the
right
setting
such
as
today
pours
a
golden
yellow
colored
body
with
a
huge
creamy
white
head
lasting
with
okay
lacing
has
a
light
strange
aroma
maybe
corn
or
something
sweet
has
a
watery
palate
and
a
sweet
taste
with
that
same
corn
from
the
aroma
in
the
flavor
nothing
particularly
special
a
plain
inoffensive
eurolager
unless
of
course
youre
out
and
about
and
getting
your
greek
on
i
know
that
has
other
connotations
but
im
strictly
talking
about
their
cuisine
and
tolerable
enough
to
have
a
few
that
is
if
the
retsina
isnt
quite
doing
it
for
you
final
thoughts
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
i
am
sure
is
just
the
generic
fallback
beer
of
greece
nothing
stands
out
or
impresses
and
the
beer
is
clearly
meant
to
be
guzzled
down
its
not
that
its
a
bad
beer
it
just
leaves
the
pallet
wanting
something
more
maybe
if
i
lived
in
greece
it
wouldnt
be
that
bad
but
the
import
cost
for
this
beer
makes
it
not
worthwhile
to
buy
again
feel
and
drinkability
ive
never
said
this
before
but
this
beer
is
wet
i
mean
the
finish
is
very
wet
feeling
very
watery
carbonation
isnt
as
high
or
as
prickly
as
i
thought
it
would
be
it
drinks
like
water
feels
like
water
tastes
very
watery
this
is
easy
to
drink
but
it
doesnt
satisfy
way
overpriced
dont
go
seeking
this
one
out
its
definitely
not
worth
it
those
greeks
better
watch
out
a
beer
like
this
might
anger
dinoysis
and
who
knows
what
hell
do
exact
his
revenge
not
much
that
impresses
or
strikes
me
as
remarkable
a
new
bottle
i
saw
at
the
lcbo
onto
the
review
pours
out
a
nice
light
yellow
color
with
little
laceing
looks
like
a
nice
light
lager
smell
was
pretty
good
nice
floral
hop
aroma
and
a
bit
of
skunk
in
the
background
this
tasted
great
goes
down
nice
and
smooth
with
little
hop
bite
its
just
like
velvet
sometimes
i
just
enjoy
a
light
flavorful
lager
mouthfell
is
nice
and
full
perfect
carbonation
like
velvet
drinkability
is
great
i
have
slammed
mythos
all
night
and
it
was
great
great
cheap
beer
not
as
bad
as
i
was
expecting
i
dare
say
it
would
taste
a
whole
lot
better
if
i
was
sitting
in
the
sun
with
the
aegean
in
front
of
me
mythos
hellenic
lager
beer
pours
a
golden
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
from
an
11
2
ounce
green
bottle
the
aroma
is
grainy
and
skunky
the
flavor
is
grainy
and
there
seems
to
be
a
touch
of
lemon
like
flavor
not
as
bad
as
i
feared
but
not
especially
good
this
is
a
typical
mass
produced
lager
beer
intended
to
be
consumed
as
a
refreshment
rather
than
beer
pours
a
clear
yellow
color
and
has
a
very
weak
smell
the
taste
is
very
common
and
also
weak
with
some
metalic
aftertaste
too
light
to
the
mouth
overdosed
with
co2
to
hide
its
mediochrity
i
might
drink
a
couple
of
these
if
i
had
nothing
else
to
drink
but
thats
it
pours
a
pale
straw
with
a
very
bubbly
white
head
that
receded
fairly
quickly
and
left
decent
lacing
the
aroma
is
pretty
tame
with
some
corn
and
light
sweet
malts
the
taste
is
on
the
sweeter
side
of
things
as
lagers
go
with
a
solid
malt
backbone
with
some
typical
lager
grains
as
well
the
mouthfeel
is
bubbly
with
a
slightly
unpleasant
bitterness
in
the
finish
this
is
pretty
drinkable
especially
while
sitting
on
the
beach
in
crete
but
i
would
put
this
on
my
recommended
list
pours
clear
light
yellow
with
little
white
head
smell
malty
sweet
grassy
taste
the
same
a
little
too
sweet
lack
of
carbonation
feels
too
flat
its
drinkable
i
guess
but
there
is
nothing
special
i
would
have
this
on
ocasion
but
really
you
can
find
much
better
lagers
out
there
update
oct
2011
holiday
on
zante
again
hads
this
beer
in
three
forms
can
bottle
ontap
refreshing
but
still
boring
i
do
not
recommend
this
one
features
a
reasonable
crystal
malt
backbone
with
a
decent
hop
laden
finish
this
somehow
tastes
a
little
more
authentic
than
most
generic
macro
lagers
too
much
carbonation
to
really
allow
the
drinker
to
appreciate
the
flavor
fully
this
is
not
a
bad
brew
but
definitely
not
something
you
need
to
look
out
for
natch
adio
d
fairly
typical
for
a
european
lager
by
no
means
the
worst
but
certainly
not
worth
buying
a
case
if
you
are
in
athens
had
a
bottle
at
a
local
greek
restaurant
with
dinner
not
as
distinctive
as
other
greek
beers
ive
had
it
tastes
like
most
other
massproduced
european
lagers
if
you
had
hidden
the
bottle
and
told
me
it
was
a
bitburger
or
amstel
i
probably
would
have
believed
it
a
nice
blond
lager
normal
head
s
nice
hop
nose
with
a
little
malt
t
refeshing
nice
malt
taste
d
perfect
beer
fot
hot
summer
days
i
expected
a
less
tasty
beer
better
than
most
of
canadian
blond
lager
beer
perfectly
recommandable
d
this
is
a
smooth
and
refreshing
beer
that
is
easy
to
drink
in
multiples
as
far
as
drinkability
goes
it
goes
down
easy
i
would
not
recommend
this
to
an
aficionado
but
those
who
have
yet
to
discover
better
beer
may
find
this
refreshing
and
enjoyable
i
would
not
go
out
of
my
way
to
try
this
beer
again
i
have
tried
very
hard
not
to
let
my
love
of
hops
and
malt
interfere
with
this
review
but
i
enjoy
and
respect
complexity
and
this
beer
had
none
i
would
say
a
very
average
or
below
average
for
its
style
clear
golden
corn
syrup
hue
finger
high
white
head
mildly
carbonated
very
slow
some
lacing
sticks
around
smells
a
bit
skunky
damp
socks
perhaps
malt
taste
is
bitter
dry
mouthfeel
that
lingers
comparable
to
a
stella
with
a
dense
body
and
texture
i
find
in
some
euro
lagers
i
can
appreciate
one
of
these
on
a
hot
day
or
a
steamy
night
but
i
wouldnt
want
to
drink
too
many
of
them
at
one
sitting
really
not
much
more
i
can
say
about
this
d
suitable
for
sitting
on
the
beach
and
looking
for
simple
refreshment
and
does
go
down
smooth
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
i
tried
this
beer
on
august
31
2007
at
smokeless
joes
in
toronto
the
beer
poured
a
translucent
gold
colour
with
almost
no
head
but
a
lot
of
effervescence
the
aroma
had
hints
of
malt
and
wheat
the
mouthfeel
was
mediumbodied
with
a
high
level
of
carbonation
the
flavour
was
grassy
with
a
hint
of
hops
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
this
was
a
pretty
forgettable
beer
but
knocked
greece
off
of
my
country
list
d
drinkable
beer
that
would
be
fine
on
a
hot
summer
day
on
a
greek
island
but
short
of
that
i
wont
be
revisiting
it
any
time
soon
drinkability
average
the
greeks
seemed
to
be
really
proud
of
this
beer
the
woman
on
the
ferry
boasted
how
this
was
a
great
beer
simply
because
it
was
made
in
greece
after
being
pressured
into
trying
it
when
i
really
wanted
a
carlsberg
and
adhering
to
my
grandfathers
axiom
of
always
be
bold
try
new
things
mike
i
had
a
go
after
suffering
a
sunburn
and
a
killer
thirst
in
the
delian
sun
but
since
it
was
available
at
the
greek
restaurant
i
was
at
drinkable
enough
a
nice
beer
on
a
hot
dayshadmanfeb

what
can
you
really
expect
form
a
greek
macro
decent
head
retention
with
a
touch
of
hops
and
straw
maybe
id
enjoy
this
in
santorini
theres
nothing
offensive
here
i
saw
green
bottle
and
thought
skuny
though
but
it
was
jsut
too
much
of
a
bland
lager
for
my
tastes
not
terrible
flavors
however
in
this
are
rather
dull
on
the
palate
there
is
very
little
in
the
way
of
character
but
worse
i
dont
like
it
its
not
as
bad
as
happoshu
it
tastes
like
water
if
i
wanted
to
drink
a
lot
of
it

i

cloudy
light
yellow
beer
with
a
little
bit
of
foamy
white
head
that
vanishes
almost
imeadiately
there
is
a
sharp
bite
in
the
backround
of
the
grainy
aroma
that
sharpness
comes
in
at
the
begining
of
the
sip
followed
by
the
grainy
sweetness
and
a
smooth
bitterness
at
the
end
this
seems
a
little
more
robust
than
most
lagers

nothing
special
to
note
about
this
beer
a
fairly
drinkable
speaking
in
quantity
but
why
would
i
wan
to
drink
a
lot
of
this
beer
with
so
many
other
great
beers
waiting
to
be
tasted

deep
golden
color
very
light
and
refreshing
nice
balance
between
malt
sweetness
hypercarbonatedbeyond
soda
pop
again
the
graininess
is
dominating
no
hop
i
will
not
finish
this
beer
i
think
its
poor
even
by
most
macro
standards
o
this
was
easy
to
drink
due
to
how
light
and
watered
down
it
was
but
overall
this
was
not
enjoyable
i
will
not
be
drinking
this
again
smell
is
sweet
and
corny
on
the
apple
juice
side
also
tastes
quite
sweet
and
of
corn
and
apple
juice
thin
bodied
mild
carbonation
not
offensive
just
anonymous
it
could
be
worse
but
it
could
be
better
everythings
faint
and
boring
dont
bother
probably
the
best
lager
so
beer
that
ive
tried
from
china
and
while
it
saddens
me
that
its
from
the
abinbev
arm
there
it
also
doesnt
surprise
me
this
is
pretty
much
bud
since
the
usual
runoff
skank
i
get
from
this
countrys
beers
seems
to
be
absent
so
considering
the
many
degrees
of
degradation
um
good
i
will
continue
to
seek
out
these
largerfresherharbins
and
hope
that
anyone
aware
of
a
direct
supplier
of
them
please
let
me
know
as
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
but
refuse
to
drink
the
substandard
12oz
variety
that
seems
to
be
the
only
thing
available
at
this
point
to
me
so
if
you
can
find
a
source
of
the
22oz
harbins
definitely
chill
one
good
and
give
it
a
try
goes
great
with
sushi
too
d
the
carbonation
and
extreme
dryness
of
this
beer
make
it
a
little
hard
to
take
down
i
feel
like
i
would
need
some
water
after
a
couple
bottles
of
this
o
honestly
i
remember
this
being
better
while
on
vacation
but
then
again
it
was
humid
and
warm
again
like
pretty
much
all
other
chinese
lagers
this
one
isnt
anywhere
near
special
but
for
thirst
quenching
purposes
this
hits
the
spot
its
pretty
standard
fare
but
id
drink
it
again
and
will
at
some
point
im
sure
this
beer
pours
out
as
a
golden
color
with
some
quick
fading
head
the
smell
was
hardly
noticeable
at
all
the
taste
was
just
about
the
same
as
the
aroma
very
light
the
mouthfeel
was
carbonated
and
light
overa
this
beer
wasnt
that
great
nothing
to
rave
about
o
it
is
easy
drinking
and
is
not
offensive
enough
to
mind
downing
the
entire
large
bottle
specifics
on
my
bottle
bought
at
a
large
chinese
supermarket
in
qingdao
china
according
to
the
label
it
has
at
least
3
6
abv
with
10
degree
plato
gravity
beer
advocate
desperately
needs
a
asian
adjunct
lager
category
i
think
this
beer
wouldve
got
better
ratings
of
they
expected
a
euro
pale
lager
i
think
this
is
one
of
the
best
asian
adjunct
lager
ive
had
better
than
sapporo
or
sing
ha
or
whatever
its
called
give
it
a
shot
if
you
want
something
cheap
tasting
drinkability
easy
drinker
but
id
pick
others
over
this
of
the
style
this
is
a
sad
looking
pissyellow
beer
with
no
head
corny
and
grainy
not
much
else
here
im
struggling
to
find
descriptors
here
there
is
just
a
massive
lack
of
flavor
ok
i
found
some
dms
but
isnt
that
unwanted
in
a
beer
this
isnt
just
a
bland
beer
it
has
a
strange
twang
to
it
that
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
regardless
im
glad
to
have
gotten
rid
of
this
last
bottle
from
my
fridge
comments
all
in
all
this
is
an
enjoyable
albeit
average
beer
with
some
decent
attributes
this
is
one
of
those
when
in
rome
beers
meaning
youd
be
lucky
to
find
a
panasian
eatery
that
has
a
diverse
beer
selection
so
this
will
suffice
in
the
meantime
perhaps
one
of
the
cleanest
chinese
lagers
to
date
and
a
sure
pick
when
put
up
against
the
rest
kung
pao
beef
with
a
side
of
singapore
fried
rice
would
be
sizeable
enough
to
tangle
with
this
beer
seemed
to
have
some
kind
of
zest
equated
with
hops
though
and
a
slight
enjoyable
bitterness
i
mean
it
grows
on
you
what
looked
doubtful
made
a
return
back
to
acceptable
and
beyond
i
dunno
what
they
used
as
a
barley
malt
substitute
but
its
very
light
its
a
light
beer
but
its
pretty
enjoyable
dont
think
its
corn
not
that
kind
of
sweetness
compared
to
other
beers
in
china
its
one
of
the
better
ones
but
still
quite
poor
compared
to
beers
from
the
rest
of
the
world
taste
is
very
inconsistent
usually
its
fine
a
basic
light
larger
i
have
found
on
many
occasions
that
its
can
have
a
stale
taste
in
that
case
its
time
to
switch
to
something
else
because
the
whole
batch
is
bad
and
every
harbin
in
the
bar
will
taste
the
same
other
times
it
seems
overly
hopped
for
the
style
which
is
a
pleasant
surprise
due
to
the
fact
that
chinese
beers
hardly
have
any
hop
flavor
at
all
also
i
found
a
fly
in
one
of
mine
so
drink
with
caution
harbin
was
a
good
lager
nothing
exceptional
but
solid
light
bodied
and
well
carbonation
but
short
of
vapid
and
fizzy
this
has
a
bit
of
character
to
it
albeit
subtle
its
biggest
asset
is
its
thirst
quenching
ability
its
better
than
quite
a
few
true
euro
lagers
out
there
better
than
expected
but
still
about
mediocre
taste
a
little
bitterness
at
first
that
leads
into
a
slight
sweetness
there
are
no
strong
flavors
either
way
but
they
are
fairly
balanced
to
make
a
good
not
great
taste
cool
to
try
just
to
say
you
have
had
a
beer
from
china
but
nothing
special
and
the
chinese
are
not
really
known
for
brewing
world
class
beers
ill
take
their
food
over
this
beer
any
day
notes
the
bottle
came
in
a
plastic
cloth
like
cover
that
was
nicely
tied
around
the
neck
of
the
bottle
and
had
chinese
writing
on
it
they
should
have
invested
more
in
the
beer
flavor
and
less
about
what
the
packaging
looked
like
poured
from
a
green
bottle
into
a
weizen
glass
has
a
pale
yellow
color
with
a
12
inch
head
there
is
a
slightly
skunky
aroma
taste
is
light
and
dry
not
much
flavor
feels
light
and
watery
in
the
mouth
drinkability
is
good
overall
an
average
beer
beer
pours
a
crystal
clear
light
golden
color
with
decent
cap
of
white
foam
above
it
somewhat
bready
aroma
but
some
adjunct
rice
maybe
corn
as
well
light
on
the
palate
slightly
carbonated
malt
with
more
adjunct
in
the
flavor
finishes
snappy
with
a
little
bitterness
not
terrible
but
could
do
with
out
the
adjunct
fairly
average
for
the
style
best
paired
with
extremely
greasy
andor
spicy
entrees
including
egg
foo
young
noodles
vegetables
and
rice
overall
a
carbonated
mouth
feel
that
is
a
little
dry
the
body
of
the
beer
is
very
light
and
the
finish
is
nil
this
beer
is
nothing
special
to
me
it
taste
like
a
hopped
up
budweiser
pours
bright
yellow
with
a
sturdy
white
head
aroma
of
pilsner
malt
taste
is
slightly
sweet
with
most
of
the
flavor
coming
from
the
malt
but
its
very
well
balanced
sort
of
like
miller
lite
if
it
was
good
at
all
and
from
china
lots
of
carbonation

of

worthwhile
to
seek

nor
worht
mentioning
particularly
besides
the
fancy
and
slightly
odd

not

just
slightly
less

mouthfeeldrinkability
the
saving
grace
of
this
beer
im
loving
the
wonderful
texture
thin
and
unassuming
on
the
outset
it
quickly
effervesces
and
becomes
almost
perfectly
suited
for
drinking
alone
or
with
food
im
happy
to
have
had
the
opportunity
to
sample
this
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
2
finger
head
smells
of
malts
and
a
bit
skunky
the
taste
was
very
bland
malty
and
a
bit
of
rice
and
skunky
after
taste
mouthful
was
very
carbonated
for
me
the
drinkability
isnt
all
that
great
just
didnt
do
it
for
me
light
in
color
with
a
nice
3
finger
head
as
poured
head
was
long
lasting
unfortunatley
the
flavor
like
most
lagers
is
mild
and
non
remarkable
still
for
a

feel
it
is

good

i
could

by

still
why

wouldnt

well
it
is
better
than
tsingtao
the
nations
other
massmarketed
beer
available
in
the
us
i
do
have
to
admit
that
although
this
beer
is
simply
average
the
outside
wrap
engraved
with
chinese
writing
then
tied
to
the
bottle
like
wrapping
paper
to
a
gift
gives
the
eye
the
impression
its
something
special
as
far
as
asian
beers
go
i
would
go
for
a
singha
asahi
or
tiger
before
this
one
i
will
pass
on
buying
this
again
drinkability
average
nothing
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
for
a
decent
beer
for
the
hot
summer
months
and
imo
better
than
the
bmc
out
there
good
luck
in
beijing
but
i
recommend
avoiding
this
one
d
well
it
is
easy
to
drink
but
then
again
it
tastes
a
lot
like
water
might
be
a
good
choice
for
someone
who
is
being
introduced
to
world
beers
so
i
tried
this
beer
after
the
bud
girl
that
stocks
my
store
recommended
it
there
was
my
first
mistake
it
was
the
bud
girl
that
recommeneded
it
anyway
i
thought
id
give
it
a
go
had
some
cool
chinese
on
the
label
probably
means
we
pee
in
beer
you
amercians
drink
now
poured
a
light
watery
gold
color
with
a
fast
fizzling
head
smell
was
mildly
hopped
with
an
even
milder
vegetablesoggy
cereal
sweetness
taste
was
thin
and
grassy
with
a
metallic
finish
i
just
stick
with
the
chinese
food
d
this
is
just
another
massproduced
beer
zero
flavor
and
no
personality
whatsoever
pass
poured
a
little
darker
than
expected
nice
head
that
quickly
dissipated
aroma
wasnt
bad
thought
it
would
be
skunky
but
it
wasnt
pretty
much
a
typical
chinese
lager
tasted
a
little
better
than
others
ive
had
but
doesnt
compare
to
a
good
german
lager
got
it
because
id
never
had
it
they
were
practically
giving
it
away
at
the
beer
store
probably
wont
get
it
again
d
this
beer
is
pretty
boring
and
almost
nasty
in
a
blind
taste
test
this
could
be
confused
for
natural
light
or
something
of
that
ilk
pass
this
chinese
lager
is
certainly
better
than
most
if
not
all
chinese
beers
ive
had
to
date
it
reminded
me
of
japanese
beers
kirin
sapporo
etc
some
skunkiness
but
nothing
offensive
not
a
bad
lager
not
an
awesome
one
either
great
for
chinese
standards
note
it
is
ok
for
try
a
north
chinese
traditional
beer
pours
an
expected
clear
straw
gold
nose
right
from
the
open
was
with
a
touch
of
sweet
but
it
quickly
faded
to
basically
nothing
flavor
is
more
of
what
youd
expect
mild
and
smooth
though
there
is
a
touch
of
slight
sweet
to
it
and
a
fresh
taste
mouthfeel
is
standard
drinkability
is
high
since
it
is
so
light
and
goes
down
easy
for
the
price
not
really
worth
it
might
as
well
drink
a
tsing
tao
overall
its
beer
nothing
to
run
out
and
try
i
can
see
how
ab
would
be
affiliated
with
this
brewery

colored
in
the
glass
it
has
a
medium
white
head
and
a
very
nice
nose
full
of
spicy
hops
and
malt
the
flavor
tends
toward
sweetness
but
there
is
enough
hops
in
it
to
keep
that
under
control
it
finishes
with
a
really
nice
lager
snap
this
brew
has
a
fair
amount
of
depth
and
character
for
its
style
the

grainy
and
goes
down
kind
of
rough
tastes
of
corn
in
the
aftertaste
very
average
unimpressive
this
is
from
china
id
have
a
hard
time
believing
that
if
it
wasnt
on
the
label
for
a
run
of
the
mill
chinese
macro
this
was
a
pleasant
surprise
an
alternate
theory
is
that
the
only
reason
my
expectations
were
exceeded
was
because
they
were
so
low
worth
a
shot
for
the
curious
the
beer
pours
a
pale
gold
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
crisp
clean
pale
malt
and
adjunct
scent
along
with
a
dry
lager
yeast
aroma
it
seems
to
be
maltier
than
some
asian
lagers
the
taste
is
decent
as
well
it
has
a
smooth
pale
malt
and
adjunct
flavor
it
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
clean
with
a
bit
of
malt
sweetness
its
dry
with
a
slight
green
bottle
skunkiness
but
nothing
too
off
putting
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
low
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
pretty
good
asian
lager
like
i
said
its
got
more
malt
flavor
than
most
which
seem
almost
entirely
made
with
rice
and
corn
its
smooth
and
clean
an
easy
drinker
d
not
bad
at
all
id
choose
this
over
many
of
the
other
departures
from
our
beloved
selection
of
beer
but
overall
it
is
very
forgettable
as
far
as
im
concerned
if
i
had
to
choose
between
heineken
and
this
id
probably
take
this
presentation
packaged
in
a
twelveounce
green
glass
bottle
with
a
popoff
crown
served
in
a
standard
pint
tap
glass
pours
out
a
straight
up
yellow
with
a
thin
head
that
fizzes
out
to
nothing
looks
absolutely
still
smells
of
pale
malts
graininess
little
alcohol
and
has
a
pretty
strong
solvent
edge
tastes
pretty
much
like
a
lighter
heineken
with
all
flavors
subdued
faint
malt
faint
graininess
nearly
nonexistent
hops
and
has
an
odd
but
somewhat
pleasing
twang
to
it
at
the
end
that
reminds
me
of
allsorghum
beer
mouthfeel
is
pretty
light
and
fizzy
but
a
little
sticky
as
well
this
is
ok
and
a
bit
odd
really
wouldnt
buy
it
again
but
as
far
as
chinese
beers
available
to
me
id
take
this
over
tsingtao
hop
and
the
pretty
green
bottle
meh
overall
blah
very
little
flavor
not
worth
the
time
aroma
is
strong
typical
of
a
lager
malty
and
with
a
bite
but
better
than
most
lagers
i
have
tried
color
is
a
typical
lager
yellow
with
a
fairly
thick
and
not
persistent
white
head
flavor
is
malty
and
rich
with
hints
of
hop
flavor
and
bitterness
as
well
as
a
good
alcohol
zing
this
lager
seems
to
fill
the
mouth
as
few
lagers
especially
american
macrobrews
do
d
well
i
drank
it
really
fast
and
i
dont
think
it
was
to
get
the
experience
over
with
it
actually
went
down
nicely
and
was
quite
easy
to
drink
drinkability
is
great
this
is
a
brew
that
has
a
good
balance
of
aroma
and
taste
while
remaining
refreshing
and
light
on
the
stomach
that
being
said
nothing
stands
out
about
it
it
is
just
your
runofthemill
pale
lager
poured
into
a
pilsener
glass
a
straw
golden
color
with
a
thick
white
head
that
builds
up
and
then
dies
down
quickly
smell
is
some
spices
and
rice
the
taste
is
a
little
sweet
wit
some
honey
and
maybe
a
little
ginger
as
well
mouth
feeling
is
light
and
a
little
smooth
creamy
as
well
drinkability
i
bought
one
just
to
try
as
i
finish
it
off
there
is
no
need
to
ever
have
another
not
very
good
there
are
much
better
macro
lagers
available
for
much
less
skip
it
this
beer
poured
a
golden
straw
color
with
very
foamy
bleach
white
head
it
had
a
strong
smell
of
grain
the
taste
was
a
little
skunky
and
very
light
it
had
a
european
lager
quality
and
really
didnt
have
a
strong
character
it
was
clean
and
refreshing
and
went
down
smooth
with
very
little
body
in
all
i
would
say
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
and
certainly
worth
a
try
i
would
recommend
spending
too
much
time
looking
for
it
because
youll
be
disappointed
but
if
you
come
across
one
go
for
it
its
a
non
offensive
beer
overall

i
feel
the
need
to
describe
the
packaging
of
this
beer
there
is
a
green
bottle
with
a
foil
neck
cover
and
a
white
paperplastic
with
chinese

tied
around
the
bottle
by
a

cord
very
fancy

typical

lager
aroma
hoppy
bordering
on
skunky
not

taste
is
in
the
same
vein
as
heineken
pretty
good
for
an
asian
lager
decent
ab
backed
option
when
eating
sushi
remember
they
have
stakes
in
kirin
as
well
and
im
sure
somebody
as
a
piece
of
sapporo
products
but
here
it
goes
appears
a
clear
bright

in

for

it

i
must
say
a
surprise
seeing
as
the
other
2
chinese
lagers
werent
so
great
and
the
price
was
good
too
worth
a
try
if
you
like
pale
lagers
avoid
d
this
is
an
okay
beer
fairly
typical
for
the
style
i
dont
recommend
it

you
are

not

no

quite
smooth
typical
lager
taste
throughout
a
good
basic
lager
without
bells
and
whistles
very
wellmade
a
very
nice
beer
ps
it
didnt
very
average
nothing
i
would
seek
out
there
are
many
fine
beverages
from
asia
but
unfortunately
this
is
not
one
of
them
i
was
actually
reminded
of
many
of
the
us
malt
liquors
out
there
when
i
sampled
this
beer
a
few
sips
and
it
was
poured
right
in
the
sink
caught
somewhere
between
german
pilsner
and
american
macro
not
quite
enough
yeast
character
for
a
euro
pale
lager
theres
a
touch
of
hops
and
bready
grains
theres
hints
of
adjunct
but
the
corn
or
rice
doesnt
dominate
the
beer
like
most
macros
if
this
were
cheap
and
not
in
green
bottles
i
might
have
it
again
da
drinkability
a
really
clean
lager
lighter
on
the
malt
pretty
heavy
hops
and
a
very
dry
finish
would
it
make
it
good
to
pair
with
any
meal
where
the
flavors
would
not
over
power
this
beer
d
more
drinkable
than
i
expected
its
not
a
fantastic
beer
but
its
a
decent
lager
very
light
mouthfeel
with
bits
of
grainyness
goes
down
easy
enoughlike
water
just
needs
more
flavor
it
was
such
a
nice
looking
bottle
too
a
light
straw
in
color
with
a
white
head
that
sticks
around
awhile
smell
is
skunky
with
rice
and
grain
the
taste
has
a
sweetness
along
with
rice
but
overall
rather
muted
in
flavor
a
simple
lager
with
a
light
med
mouthfeel
and
light
carbonation
that
is
generally
not
to
bad
drinkablitly
is
the
strong
point
here
this
beer
was
drinkable
not
drainworthy
a
really
easy
to
drink
beer
if
not
a
great
one
i
actually
rather
like
it
i
had
no
idea
what
to
expect
from
harbin
lager
what
i
got
was
the
best
chinese
beer
ive
ever
had
i
assume
that
affiliated
with
anheuserbusch
means
the
boys
from
st
louis
made
sure
the
brewing
standards
were
up
to
snuff
if
so
it
definitely
shows
in
the
final
product
price
2
49
for
a
16oz
bottle
at
liquor
barn
hurstbourne
really
wellmade
superbly
balanced
quite
nice
harbin
is
a
respectable
beer
if
i
was
faced
with
a
poor
beer
selection
at
a
chinese
restaurant
i
would
order
this
over
bmc
heineken
or
most
other
asian
lagers
i
would
never
consider
buying
a
sixpack
of
this
beer
even
though
every
damn
grocery
store
carries
it
thank
you
ab
i
purchased
a
snazzy
600ml
chinese
new
year
bottle
with
rice
paper
covering
i
couldnt
say
no
maybe
it
was
going
to
be
good
and
in
some
ways
it
is
ill
finish
my
bottle
it
is
worth
a
try
in
a
pinch
not
that
bad
well
it
came
in
a
pretty
little
sakelike
bottle
at
least
that
was
my
justification
for
buying
the
beer
afterwhich
i
realized
that
this
was
not
a
good
beer
green
bottle
eurotype
beers
almost
always
promise
disaster
the
offset
of
aromas
give
a
tomcatty
aroma
pungent
and
musky
nearly
skunked
the
look
is
a
nearfizzy
carbonation
disapointing
retention
but
hey
it
has
a
clear
straw
color
the
taste
was
of
grain
rice
and
malt
very
sweet
similar
to
raw
corn
sugar
very
little
complexity
or
variety
the
feel
is
a
slick
coating
of
the
mouth
finishes
with
a
mild
hop
flavor
earthiness
and
pronounced
sweetness
the
beer
was
just
not
that
good
though
the
pakaging
is
fantastic
this
is
what
i
assume
to
be
the
chinese
version
of
macro
this
euro
pale
lager
pours
a
lighter
apple
juice
with
a
quickly
fading
perfectly
white
foamy
head
smelled
a
bit
skunky
common
for
me
when
comparing
the
noses
on
a
lot
of
european
lagers
taste
was
fairly
clean
though
there
was
subtle
skunky
bitterness
that
thankfully
didnt
translate
into
the
finish
this
light
bodied
lager
would
indeed
pair
well
with
spicy
chinese
fair
though
lending
its
thirst
quenching
abilities
when
you
need
it
most
enjoy
the
whiff
of
euro
skunk
lead
into
a
sharp
bite
of
hop
this
had
a
decent
taste
of
malt
and
hop
surprised
me
and
i
would
say
a
full
sixer
of
these
would
not
be
a
bad
afternoon
more
of
a
lawnmower
brew

but
at
7
a
sixer
that
is
a
little
pricey
and
the
bottles
were
only
11
2
ounce
also
no
dating
so
im
not
confident
how
fresh
this
may
be
pours
a
bright
gold
with
the
slightest
hint
of
red
pillowy
head
that
eventually
fades
to
the
slightest
bit
of
lacing
aroma
is
a
little
sweet
with
fruity
malty
tones
and
the
slight
nip
of
a
floral
hop
aroma
taste
is
much
like
the
nose
with
maybe
a
little
more
hop
presence
carbonation
is
soft
and
pehaps
a
little
lacking
a
little
more
pop
would
do
this
beer
good
all
in
all
not
unpleasant
and
i
wouldnt
say
no
if
given
one
but
bottle
is
notable
as
it
came
wrapped
in
an
unusual
silky
paper
sleeve
pours
a
light
golden
amber
color
with
a
bright
white
head
nose
is
probably
the
highlight
of
the
beer
with
notes
of
piney
hops
and
perfume
the
carbonation
is
nice
but
the
beer
is
too
thinit
comes
across
like
watered
down
champagne
taste
is
watered
down
grain
and
a
bit
of
grassy
hops
might
be
acceptable
on
a
hot
day
but
thats
about
it
another
sample
from
my
ab
buddy
this
one
is
just
like
drinking
a
good
old
ic
light
that
said
its
not
horrible
so
if
you
out
in
an
exclusive
chinese
restaurant
and
it
all
they
got
then
give
it
a
swill
light
toasted
grains
and
corn
come
through
on
the
profile
with
a
tad
of
sweetness
rather
smooth
and
drinkable
maybe
bland
and
uninteresting
but
somewhat
refreshing
too
in
many
respects
i
think
this
beer
is
true
to
the
style
and
it
lacks
that
awful
skunk
kick
associated
with
most
eurolagers
worth
trying
for
novelty
sake
but
not
recommended
i
rate
this
pretty
high
on
drinkability
because
i
truly
enjoyed
this
one
brilliantly
clear
honey
topped
with
a
big
puffy
white
head
i
wish
the
head
hung
around
a
bit
longer
but
it
was
impressive
at
the
start
fairly
inoffensive
aroma
with
soapy
dank
skunky
hops
in
that
heineken
way
some
corny
notes
with
crispy
pils
malt
the
flavor
is
altogether
mild
reminding
me
of
a
bud
clone
funny
as
id
drank
half
of
this
before
sitting
down
to
type
a
review
and
saw
they
were
affiliated
with
ab
mild
semiwatery
malt
fading
off
into
a
lightly
hopped
floralsoapy
finish
some
mineral
water
notes
leaving
off
very
dry
and
vacant
there
is
a
nice
crispness
to
the
carbonation
and
the
body
is
light
and
easy
it
basically
tastes
like
bud
with
much
fancier
packaging
on
closer
inspection
i
even
see
they
have
the
horsedrawn
beer
cart
above
the
brand
name
the
packagings
really
what
grabbed
me
amazing
how
appearance
will
sway
the
consumer
even
an
educated
one
huh
i
didnt
dislike
this
one
but
it
doesnt
bring
anything
to
the
table
in
terms
of
flavor
you
never
know
it
could
have
been
great
stranger
things
have
happened
when
i
pop
open
unfamiliar
beers
id
rather
have
a
tsingtao
if
im
going
the
chinese
route
ok
drinkable
and
a
notch
above
the
usual
microbrewery
lagers
but
that
doesnt
really
make
this
a
great
beer
i
cant
see
buying
this
again
i
would
buy
pabst
blue
ribbon
first
a
drinkable
lager
yes
perhaps
a
bit
boring
but
could
easily
have
a
few
when
in
the
mood
for
a
simple
lager
in
the
slower
summer
months
overall
this
was
a
cheap
pickup
during
a
recent
trip
down
to
hitimes
in
costa
mesa
a
brew
from
china
all
delivered
is
some
fancy
looking
packaging
something
different
but
nothing
exciting
drinks
okay
nothing
special
but
better
than
bmc
pours
a
yellow
apple
juice
color
with
a
virtually
no
head
corny
smell
hits
first
off
then
slightly
sweet
malts
and
an
ever
so
slight
dustiness
that
im
assuming
is
some
hops
on
the
palate
bland
and
a
bit
sweet
with
little
in
the
way
of
hop
bitterness
on
a
bit
comes
in
at
the
end
the
end
finishes
with
sweet
dried
corn
thin
mouthfeel
with
medium
carbonation
overall
not
an
appetizing
beer
and
not
even
really
drinkable
given
that
sickly
corn
smellflavor
drinkability

okay
but
as
it
is
twice
the
price
of
a
tsingtao
where
i
live
i
cant
find
a
reason
to
order
a
second
bottle
actually
very
nice
presentation
if
a
little
odd
with
it
being
wrapped
in
some
fancy
clean
room
hair
net
thing
with
a
gold
bow
and
the
bottlelabel
is
very
cool
600ml
dark
green
bottle
reasonably
nice
looking
lager
deeper
yellow
than
usual
with
a
nice
sized
bubbly
pure
white
head
aroma
ohhhh
well
i
will
leave
it
at
the
hairnet
did
not
stop
this
beer
from
getting
skunked
bad
only
other
aroma
i
pick
up
is
a
graininess
taste
while
nothing
special
is
better
than
the
aroma
just
plain
lager
here
some
fruitiness
and
a
touch
of
grassy
hop
rather
watery
palate
after
all
the
money
and
thought
they
put
into
the
packaging
i
would
have
liked
at
least
some
effort
put
into
the
beer
not
horrible
but
far
from
good
if
you
took
the
label
off
this
and
served
it
i
would
swear
it
is
tsingtao
apparently
this
light
colored
light
bodied
lager
with
little
taste
or
aroma
is
a
chinese
staple
not
much
more
to
say
about
this
other
than
that
if
i
have
it
again
ill
make
sure
i
do
so
with
chinese
food
instead
of
a
stand
alone
obviously
ab
is
trying
to
tap
into
the
enormous
chinese
populace
with
this
purchase
the
pour
is
gold
with
a
large
fluffy
head
the
aroma
and
taste
have
mild
saazy
hops
and
practically
nothing
else
there
no
offensive
adjuncts
i
dont
see
how
this
light
flavorless
brew
can
reflex
the
tradition
and
culture
of
chinas
most
northern
province
of
heilongjang
im
not
an
expert
on
the
culture
of
heilongjang
but
still
the
mouthfeel
was
very
light
no
cleansing
was
somewhat
slippery
feeling
not
good
overall
this
beer
looks
nice
in
the
bottle
and
in
the
glass
but
there
is
not
much
going
on
after
that
nothing
offensive
but
no
character
honey
sweetness
to
it
very
crisp
clean
and
fresh
tasting
what
makes
this
bottle
of
beer
go
over
the
edge
is
the
bottle
design
as
well
as
its
organic
nature
you
can
taste
the
quality
and
craftsmanship
no
additives
or
preservatives
or
at
least
the
chemical
ones
overallcomments
this
is
one
of
the
better
beers
i
have
had
in
quite
a
while
beer
is
very
drinkable
with
spoton
flavor
and
nose
a
prime
example
of
the
style
this
a
must
try
lager
consumed
1814
classified
as
a
euro
pale
lager
5
abv
the
taste
begins
with
malt
that
is
mild
and
yeast
fruitinesss
with
a
slight
applepear
quality
wiht
subtle
sweetness
level
and
a
hint
of
spice
in
the
periphery
with
a
slight
toasted
grain
flavor
in
the
middle
the
flavor
is
on
the
dry
side
with
herbal
hops
adding
to
the
flavor
with
mildly
bitter
taste
as
it
finishes
overall
i
consider
this
very
good
a
clean
lager
with
a
lot
of
flavor
excellent
drinkability
for
the
style
this
is
just
a
great
beer
such
a
simple
brew
solution
yet
the
product
of
this
labor
is
perfect
its
the
only
lager
ive
ever
found
to
have
malty
legs
its
perfect
blend
of
barley
and
hops
gives
you
the
sense
that
its
malty
and
bitter
attributes
are
released
on
to
your
taste
buds
for
an
epic
battle
which
is
ultimately
just
won
by
the
hops
army
the
finish
is
crisp
but
doesnt
leave
your
tongue
feeling
dry
the
complexity
of
the
competing
flavors
makes
for
a
fantastic
taste
interrupted
by
nothing
as
the
malted
barley
and
hops
in
this
beer
are
organic
it
clearly
makes
a
difference
i
would
enjoy
this
beer
in
the
company
of
the
most
boring
and
annoying
people
in
the
world

why
dont
we
see
more
of
this
happening
this
is
my
goto
lager
when
i
need
a
break
from
ipas
and
stouts
highly
recomended
i
was
definitely
pleased
when
i
had
this
after
work
a
few
weeks
ago
it
is
fresh
crisp
and
sweet
with
notes
of
caramel
and
honey
i
feel
its
simple
enough
that
all
the
ingredients
blend
perfectly
with
each
other
and
no
one
part
is
overwhelming
its
fresh
and
herbal
to
start
finishing
with
a
smooth
caramel
spice
i
will
without
a
doubt
be
drinking
plenty
of
these
this
autumn
o
this
is
a
classic
european
pale
lager
that
excels
in
appearance
and
drinkability
very
sessionable
and
quite
modest
it
delivers
a
distinctive
pale
lager
flavor
without
the
downsides
that
accompany
many
and
would
pare
nicely
with
a
variety
of
foods
especially
light
meats
and
anything
greasy
id
love
to
wash
down
some
fish
and
chips
with
this
one
ive
come
to
expect
this
level
of
quality
from
samuel
smith
and
they
again
did
not
disappoint
here
extra
kudos
for
brewing
organic
cheers
flavor
nicely

with

even

i

anything
to
criticize
about
this
beer
excellent
and
enjoyable

for

overall
i
am
very
much
a
fan
of
this
lagerquickly
becoming
one
of
my
favorites
highly
recommend
this
one
overall
the
goldstandard
for
euro
pale
lagers
in
my
book
a
great
beer
in
an
underappreciated
style
this
one
really
showcases
the
subtleties
pale
lagers
can
have
if
brewed
correctly
and
this
is
indeed
a
masterful
example
of
such
o
this
is
a
very
drinkable
and
wellcrafted
allmalt
lager
theres
nothing
in
the
way
of
off
flavors
that
are
often
attributable
to
some
of
the
beers
in
this
style
o
enjoyable
and
pairs
well
with
many
different
types
of
food
in
my
case
chinese
easy
to
drink
samuel
smiths
pure
brewed
lager
beer
pours
a
brilliant
clear
gold
with
about
a
12
of
fluff
adorning
the
top
bubbles
are
consistently
rising
indicating
a
fair
amount
of
carbonation
its
almost
perfect
as
the
head
also
clings
to
the
side
of
the
glass
nicely
the
nose
is
that
of
fresh
baked
bread
and
the
smells
of
spring
fields
a
soft
european
hop
aroma
can
be
detected
within
as
well
while
the
scents
leads
one
to
believe
the
beer
will
be
delicate
the
taste
is
much
more
vibrant
its
got
a
hearty
buttery
malt
taste
in
the
background
with
the
crisp
yet
floral
hops
coming
in
next
the
fading
sensation
in
the
finish
is
gradual
and
pleasing
the
mouth
feel
is
very
light
borderline
watery
the
best
way
i
can
describe
it
is
that
the
back
of
the
throat
is
filled
with
the
presence
of
the
beer
on
the
way
down
more
than
the
beer
actually
coats
the
mouth
during
each
sip
this
is
a
great
beer
to
get
someone
started
on
the
finer
lagers
in
life
or
for
any
beer
enthusiasts
who
are
skeptical
about
european
lagers
or
lighter
abv
beers
in
general
overall
a
decent
quaffable
beer
but
not
worth
the
steep
price
it
commands
i
would
much
rather
drink
a
baltika
3
and
maltheads
sign
up
o
one
of
the
more
intriguing
beers
ive
ever
had
the
smell
is
outstanding
and
i
may
buy
again
based
on
smell
alone
the
taste
is
just
as
compelling
for
what
it
lacks
in
comparison
to
what
it
has
to
offer
for
whatever
reason
i
have
aerosmiths
i
dont
wanna
miss
a
thing
stuck
in
my
head
right
now
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
brass
topped
by
a
finger
of
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
lightlybuttered
biscuit
very
light
grass
and
a
hint
of
honey
the
taste
holds
notes
of
dried
honey
light
toffee
even
lighter
biscuit
and
a
vague
sense
of
funky
lemon
peel
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
fluid
feel
overall
though
i
could
possibly
see
this
working
well
on
cask
dont
ask
me
why
i
just
get
that
impression
here
it
just
didnt
do
it
for
me
out
of
the
bottle
this
is
quite
the
letdown
overall
not
a
huge
fan
of
lagers
but
this
one
was
well
crafted
as
good
as
everything
they
make
o
a
very
clean
and
simple
lager
with
nice
flavor
and
great
drinkability
good
price
point
as
usual
with
ss
definitely
recommended
for
those
who
like
lagers
raul
was
pumped
on
this
but
he
highly
disagrees
with
it
raul
will
use
it
to
clean
his
windows
instead
peace
o
this
one
is
easy
to
enjoy
wouldnt
mind
a
few
in
a
row
at
a
wedding
or
the
like
much
better
values
to
be
had
though
look
elsewhere
this
is
a
good
beer
it
has
a
yellowish
gold
color
and
nice
head
when
poured
in
a
pint
glass
the
taste
of
it
is
similar
to
sam
smiths
organic
lager
but
with
less
of
an
acidic
aftertaste
the
soft
water
in
pure
brewed
lager
helps
it
go
down
smooth
and
easy
there
is
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
that
blends
well
with
the
grainy
aftertaste
its
very
pure
tasting
with
well
balanced
flavors
and
texture
something
i
can
drink
regularly
o
excellent
drinkability
one
of
the
best
lagers
ive
ever
had
o
ive
been
meaning
to
try
a
few
of
the
samuel
smith
lagers
but
havent
because
im
accustom
to
paying
no
more
than
a
dollar
a
beer
when
im
made
of
money
i
will
be
buying
bottles
of
these
in
place
of
tall
cans
overall
dang
i
like
it
5
too
plain
wrapper
plain
beer
refreshing
maybe
its
not
a
commercial
beer
in
england
afterall
seems
everything
samuel
smith
is
excellent
way
better
than
that
samuel
adams
junk
too
the
alcohol
was
spoton
too
and
had
i
hard
another
bottle
i
would
have
downed
that
after
finishing
this
i
wish
more
lagers
were
this
floral
and
easy
to
drink
theres
nothing
flashy
here
but
this
was
enjoyable
and
ups
the
ante
for
a
style
that
doesnt
get
a
whole
lot
of
love
pours
a
clear
light
yellow
with
a
1
inch
foamy
offwhite
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
and
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
maltgrain
and
some
slight
grasshay
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
along
with
a
slight
fruity
note
there
is
a
very
mild
bitterness
that
quickly
fades
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
very
refreshing
and
very
easy
to
drink
this
is
a
decent
lightbodied
lager
thats
easy
to
put
away
it
has
a
nice
corn
flakelike
flavor
that
is
welcomed
in
a
see
of
musty
watered
down
euro
lagers
i
would
try
this
again
if
i
were
in
the
mood
for
something
highly
sessionable
o
tastes
really
good
and
hits
the
spot
nothing
overly
complex
but
doesnt
need
to
be
a
solid
pale
lager
of
the
european
bent
full
comprehensive
and
thorough
you
could
be
forgiven
if
you
think
im
talking
about
insurance
policies
but
no
its
a
lager
and
a
damned
good
one
at
that
if
stiff
british
upper
lipism
is
your
thing
cheers
rjt
o
a
really
sessionable
lager
smooth
a
great
stepping
stone
from
the
bmc
lagers
o
a
beautifully
poured
lager
with
a
clean
refreshing
taste
extremely
easy
to
drink
the
appearance
was
almost
perfect
good
smoke
after
opening
nice
blonde
colorvery
busy
with
bubbles
and
good
robust
fluffy
head
and
lots
of
lace
looked
like
a
tv
commercial
the
smell
was
also
very
enticing
an
aroma
with
a
clean
malty
sweet
odor
and
yet
some
bitter
hops
to
it
as
well
the
taste
is
wonderful
again
a
great
balancevery
satisfyingno
after
taste
a
wonder
how
they
get
both
a
malty
robust
taste
and
yet
so
light
and
a
bit
of
hops
to
it
as
well
overall
just
one
of
the
best
ive
hadand
would
recommned
to
anyone
who
likes
beer
pours
a
light
golden
color
white
head
forms
and
little
lace
aroma
of
lager
yeast
some
fruityness
fresh
buttered
bread
mild
floral
notes
in
the
taste
almost
has
an
ale
yeast
fruityness
with
apple
and
pear
flavor
some
buttery
diacetyl
bread
and
leafy
hops
not
too
bitter
but
hardly
too
sweet
either
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
carbonation
is
at
a
low
medium
the
feel
is
a
little
flimsy
and
not
quite
as
crisp
but
still
fine
overall
a
decent
lager
plenty
of
character
has
that
samuel
smiths
taste
more
than
probably
from
stone
vats
the
beer
is
fermented
in
overall
another
solid
smith
but
i
prefer
their
other
lager
beer
than
this
one
when
you
search
for
an
offering
from
england
a
lager
does
not
usually
come
to
mind
despite
the
cost
this
lager
is
worth
trying
even
though
it
pales
in
comparison
to
samuel
smiths
ale
offerings
clear
and
light
yellow
in
color
with
a
nice
fluffy
head
retention
and
lacing
are
solid
aroma
is
mostly
bready
malt
cereal
a
touch
of
grassy
hops
plain
and
to
the
point
taste
is
very
much
the
same
straightforward
pale
lager
mostly
a
clean
malty
flavor
with
light
hoppiness
faint
bitterness
very
crisp
and
easy
to
drink
very
moderately
sweet
solid
carbonation
short
finish
decent
session
choice
although
i
feel
its
the
least
interesting
beer
ive
had
from
sam
smiths
and
i
generally
prefer
the
german
lagers
to
begin
with
a
very
good
euro
pale
lagerperhaps
a
great
one
that
being
said
the
style
is
quite
limiting
and
simple
in
nature
this
poured
a
clear
yellow
with
a
fingers
width
of
offwhite

was
clean
mildly
sweet

was

quite
refreshing
not

was
almost
creamy
in
a
medium

with
nice
carbonation
good
lager
nice
drinkability
another
good
one
from
samuel
smith
o
a
good
clean
crisp
classic
looking
beer
that
would
be
very
sessionable
and
help
steer
others
towards
craft
beer
as
far
as
euro
pale
lagers
go
this
one
is
pretty
good
probably
wouldnt
seek
this
one
out
though
definitely
better
lagers
out
there
o
a
very
decent
offering
by
samuel
smith
i
do
like
their
stouts
much
better
though
this
is
great
for
a
long
day
of
watching
football
and
eating
nachos
enjoy

with

perhaps
i
should
have
waited
until
a
dreary
february
day
to
have
opened
this
one
nose
smelled
of
pure
unadulterated
lager
slightly
sweet
with
an
underlying
earthiness
it
is
never
going
to
knock
your
socks
off
but
when
you
have
been
on
a
steady
diet
of
aals
as
i
have
been
with
the
canquest
tm
a
clean
adjunctfree
lager
is
a
welcome
treat
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
a
honeylike
taste
that
is
or
should
be
lagers
trademark
man
i
just
weep
for
what
we
americans
wrought
with
prohibition
people
developed
a
taste
for
bootleg
hooch
made
with
whatever
was
at
hand
and
lost
their
taste
for
wellmade
beer
boo
hoo
at
least
some
breweries
did
not
do
away
with
their
traditional
recipes
finish
was
clean
refreshing
and
semisweet
just
as
i
would
hope
all
lagers
to
be
o
this
beer
is
great
it
looks
good
tastes
good
and
feels
good
its
not
the
best
lager
ive
ever
had
mostly
due
to
its
lack
of
zest
in
the
nose
and
palate
though
its
not
offensive
its
a
drinkable
lager
that
samuel
smith
should
be
proud
of
and
if
i
can
get
my
hands
on
a
few
more
bottles
you
know
ill
be
a
happy
man
this
lager
pours
crystal
blond
in
color
with
a
generous
fine
bubbled
head
that
lasts
fairly
well
it
has
a
nice
balance
of
hops
and
malt
it
is
what
most
lagers
aspire
to
be
lovely
taste
that
one
does
not
tire
of
definitely
worth
trying
it
is
a
bit
expensive
in
the
usa
for
regular
consumption
this
beer
pours
a
golden
yellow
color
with
very
little
head
the
smell
is
a
bit
sweet
and
there
seems
to
be
a
bit
of
an
apple
juice
aroma
the
taste
is
lighter
just
a
bit
of
hops
a
bit
of
malts
very
balanced
and
i
keep
picking
up
a
flavor
like
apple
juice
light
flavor
easy
to
drink
but
wont
stay
on
the
palette
long
overall
decent
nice
in
the
summer
i
would
get
it
again
but
i
wasnt
blown
away
o
quite
a
bit
better
than
sss
organic
lager
which
preceded
this
very
drinkable
all
in
all
a
great
lager
beer
o
as
usual
a
good
beer
from
sammie
smith
very
unique
and
quality
flavors
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
traditional
golden
yellow
color
with
a
pretty
good
foamy
head
on
it
the
head
fades
after
a
few
sips
and
leave
a
little
lacing
in
the
beginning
the
smell
of
the
beer
had
a
typical
lager
aroma
grass
and
a
little
skunk
to
it
the
taste
was
pretty
crisp
and
clean
its
got
a
nice
bitter
finish
and
a
little
bit
of
sweet
grains
in
there
the
mouthfeel
was
on
the
lighter
side
with
some
good
carbonation
overall
this
beer
is
a
decent
one
to
have
when
you
got
a
group
of
people
over
and
just
wanna
offer
a
good
beer
to
them
notes
sam
smith
has
done
it
again
when
you
think
that
britain
is
all
about
ale
a
lager
such
as
this
comes
along
very
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
its
one
of
the
cleanest
brews
i
have
tried
very
refreshing
this
one
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
tiny
head
lacing
is
good
nonetheless
the
aroma
on
this
one
is
pale
bready
malts
with
a
touch
of
mineral
water
the
taste
is
just
a
nice
crisp
lager
the
smooth
malts
and
just
a
hint
of
hop
zest
make
for
a
tasty
lager
the
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
and
highly
carbonated
and
the
drinkability
is
just
about
right
for
the
style
a
good
lager
from
sam
smiths
probably
not
worth
import
prices
though
tastes
great
more
malty
than
typical
pale
lager
with
nice
grainy
notes
caramel
sweetness
and
a
lemony
bitterness
that
all
goes
down
easy
with
balanced
carbonation
extremely
drinkable
but
enjoyable
on
a
higher
level
while
you
could
throw
back
a
4
pack
of
these
easy
you
really
want
to
slow
down
and
enjoy
them
more
as
far
as
lagers
go
i
think
its
got
a
lot
af
flavor
and
could
easily
drink
a
few
of
these
in
no
time
nice
little
beer
all
around
d
could
easily
down
10
of
these
and
not
notice
o
this
is
an
a
plus
lager
but
will
never
get
that
because
of
its
lager
lack
of
luster
as
compared
to
big
time
brews
its
great
washing
down
a
meal
with
a
beer
that
has
some
taste
to
it
value
paid
2
50
for
a
single
12
oz
great
deal
d
i
could
see
myself
drinking
a
couple
of
these
especially
on
a
hot
day
its
a
rather
straight
forward
beer
and
a
good
example
of
the
style
try
again
boys
whew
pours
a
honeyyellow
color
moderate
level
of
carbonation
twofinger
white
head
that
leaves
a
bit
of
lacing
has
a
bit
of
a
bready
aroma
taste
is
quite
nice
with
a
mix
of
sweetish
malts
and
a
mild
hop
taste
in
the
finish
i
noticed
that
this
beer
seems
more
mediumbodied
than
most
lagers
was
a
bit
thicker
but
nice
drinkability
is
high
this
is
a
refreshing
beer
that
still
tastes
good
after
it
has
warmed
up
a
bit
this
isnt
samuel
smiths
best
beer
in
my
opinion
but
if
you
are
a
big
fan
of
oldfashioned
allmalt
lagers
this
is
a
good
choice
the
palate
opens
moderately
hoppy
with
a
moderate
bitterness
and
a
rather
robust
hop
flavor
earthy
and
minerallike
the
bitterness
quite
perfectly
balances
these
flavor
components
while
i
dont
know
my
malts
very
well
i
could
almost
swear
that
there
is
some
marris
otter
and
pilsner
malt
in
here
theres
a
complex
delicate
sweetness
present
a
little
bready
this
tastes
moderately
rustic
almost
a
touch
fruity
this
beer
dries
out
on
the
finish
with
a
lingering
bitterness
carbonation
is
high
this
is
a
top
notch
lager
d
for
this
style
easy
to
drink
and
tastes
good
a
fine
choice
for
the
lager
lover
d
a
little
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
decent
lighter
beer
with
a
little
bit
of
substance
making
it
worth
drinking
for
a
while
pours
a
pale
yellow
with
a
small
short

aroma
of
light

an

lager
but
drinkable
lighter

decent

refreshing

throughout
smooth
feel
combined
with
solid
flavor
makes
this
a
pretty
easy

although
the
higher

is
a
bummer

not

easy
drinking

more
than
one
would
be
no

not
an
overwhelming
beer
drinkability
is
off
the
charts
with
an
exceptional
lager
like
this
great
smell
great
taste
great
feel
it
has
all
the
qualities
of
a
great
beer
samuel
smith
knows
how
to
craft
excellent
nofrills
brews
none
of
that
triple
hop
advertising
garbage
just
a
delicious
drinking
experience
through
and
through
this
beer
pours
a
dark
honey
golden
color
aroma
is
of
a
slightly
dusty
grain
bin
full
of
recently
harvested
grain
with
a
hint
of
floral
sweetness
it
has
a
full
malt
and
grain
flavor
a
bit
of
the
musky
lager
funk
and
a
slightly
crisp
slightly
creamy
finish
on
the
mouth
pretty
good
overall
but
does
not
stand
up
to
some
european
lagers
that
are
more
flavorful
soft
and
pleasantly
drinkable
pale
yellow
with
a
finger
of
white
foam
replenished
by
the
glass
smells
predominately
of
very
fresh
hops
a
nice
springy
smell
slightly
sweet
has
a
weak
flavor
nothing
strong
reminiscent
of
american
style
lagers
but
a
good
balance
and
quality
tasting
quite
bitter
on
the
end
feels
very
light
in
the
mouth
again
like
american
style
lagers
carbonated
moderately
heavily
overall
this
is
a
nice
session
beer
quite
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
in
london
beer
is
medium
bodied
and
pretty
smooth
mild
sweetness
up
front
low
carbonation
in
the
mouth
no
aftertaste
wet
finish
some
graininess
but
its
not
bitter
or
astringent
just
nice
this
beer
is
highly
drinkable
and
i
can
see
it
being
a
nice
light
lager
to
sip
on
a
hot
day
such
as
today
i
would
definitely
drink
this
again
certainly
drinkable
due
to
its
light
character
i
was
expecting
a
bit
more
in
the
complexity
department
im
sure
it
would
be
very
refreshing
as
a
session
beer
refreshing
and
smooth
great
session
beer
price
is
a
little
on
the
steep
side
for
what
it
is
but
i
cant
think
of
too
many
examples
that
are
better
for
a
lesser
price
overall
an
easy
drinker
with
plenty
of
character
and
flavor
for
all
seasons
this
was
great
on
a
bar
rooftop
on
a
humid
summer
day
good
to
try
for
sure
light
chill
haze
that
quickly
disappeared
leaving
the
beer
a
bright
gold
colour
sticky
white
foam
coated
the
top
of
the
beer
in
a
thin
layer
and
a
more
substantial
collar
left
clumpy
lace
on
the
glass
nice
aroma
malty
caramel
and
biscuits
honey
light
hoppiness
with
notes
of
fruit
and
grass
good
balance
enough
bitterness
to
keep
the
flavour
crisp
while
letting
the
sweetness
of
the
malt
and
grassyherbal
hop
flavours
stay
in
the
spotlight
light
caramel
lingering
bitterness
and
mineral
character
slightly
crisp
carbonation
light
to
medium
bodied
dry
the
textures
more
rounded
and
smooth
than
a
good
pils
easy
drinking
and
quite
tasty
id
pick
this
up
more
often
if
i
couldnt
get
less
expensive
high
quality
lagers
on
a
regular
basis
from
the
355
ml
bottle
sampled
on
june
5
2010
the
lot
code
is
smudged
on
the
bottle
altough
the
last
few
numbers
seem
to
be
511
too
bad
because
it
is
a
good
indicator
of
whether
my
bottle
was
better
or
worse
than
someone
elses
the
pour
is
light
yellow
a
bit
cloudy
with
no
head
to
speak
of
the
aroma
smacks
of
freshness
as
well
as
a
bit
of
malts
and
floral
notes
the
taste
tenbds
to
be
a
bit
better
with
more
emphasis
on
the
malts
and
creaminess
it
is
not
bad
but
samuel
smiths
brews
many
that
are
better
d
definitely
a
wellbrewed
lager
very
good
drinkability
a
great
beer
to
enjoy
on
a
hot
summer
day
definitely
another
good
one
to
session
550ml
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
very
pure
appearance
like
it
was
brewed
with
nothing
but
the
purest
ingredients
the
first
whiff
reveals
aromas
of
malt
hops
yeast
water
and
purity
pretty
tasty
too
its
got
a
nice
bit
of
maltiness
to
it
though
its
quite
dry
and
crackery
the
mouthfeel
is
clean
and
crisp
mild
lager
yeast
character
dry
bitter
and
hoppy
finish
yummy
yum
yum
i
like
beer
in
summary
if
youre
looking
for
a
smooth
and
tasty
lager
with
a
nice
aroma
you
cannot
go
wrong
with
this
lager
from
a
truly
elite
brewer
wife
picked
this
up
for
me
though
im
not
sure
i
would
have
on
my
own
my
mistake
pint
glass
pour
and
i
am
met
with
a
crystal
clear
light
yellow
ale
with
a
bright
white
foamy
head
which
quickly
dissolves
into
a
thin
layer
malty
aroma
with
some
rice
grass
and
earthy
tones
very
refreshing
taste
crisp
and
clean
with
some
mild
spice
and
a
lot
of
light
malt
very
clean
finish
with
a
minimal
aftertaste
i
was
expecting
a
somewhat
lingering
aftertaste
from
the
aroma
but
i
got
none
of
that
nicely
done
light
carbonation
in
the
mouthfeel
and
very
dry
thin
sips
a
very
easy
drink
and
very
refreshing
a
hot
summer
lager
to
view
the
days
going
by
nice
clear
light
golden
straw
color
white
fluffy
head
with
some
stick
lots
of
carbonation
bubbles
a
lot
of
simple
sugars
on
the
nose
a
lot
of
apple
a
bit
of
apricot
a
bunch
of
light
wafer
pleasant
and
snacklike
taste
is
just
as
sweet
and
has
a
pronounced
floral
quality
that
twists
quickly
into
a
decently
bitter
finish
mouthfeel
is
slick
a
good
crisp
linger
and
dryness
at
the
end
drinkability
is
definitely
above
average
but
its
enough
like
a
dessert
beer
imo
that
intake
of
a
550
ml
bottle
will
suffice
very
nice
pretty
damn
good
brew
especially
on
a
hot
spring
day
great
balance
of
quaffable
and
flavorful
top
notch
very
drinkable
delicious
fantastic
as
the
months
get
warmer
here
this
is
a
pretty
standard
euro
pale
lager
nothing
special
overall
a
good
example
of
an
epl
thats
not
in
a
green
bottle
also
try
the
very
similar
river
horse
lager
drinkability
easy
drinking
beer
flavor
profile
is
a
bit
mellow
so
one
550ml
bottle
may
be
enough
for
one
session
drinkability
well
its
flavor
is
not
my
favorite
but
overall
it
is
a
pretty
drinkable
package
in
a
hotweather
or
hotfood
context
im
sure
i
could
down
a
couple
of
these
however
i
doubt
ill
seek
this
one
out
in
future
overall
this
one
of
the
dare
i
say
best
lagers
ive
ever
had
if
you
like
heineken
or
are
a
macro
lager
drinker
try
this
wellcrafted
brew
you
will
realize
instantly
what
a
true
beer
drinking
experience
is
many
thanks
to
the
samuel
smith
old
brewery
out
of
england
i
intend
to
try
more
of
your
beers
in
the
future
flavor
is
lightly
bitter
crisp
with
a
nice
bite
clover
honey
and
biscuit
flavors
dominate
some
mild
hop
bitterness
and
a
fleeting
impression
of
grass
or
weeds
light
bodied
and
a
little
too
watery
ultimately
clean
with
no
off
flavors
and
an
agreeable
taste
quenching
and
easy
going
a
benchmark
lager
notes
skeptical
at
first
this
side
by
side
comparison
of
organic
vs
non
organic
showed
me
that
organic
can
possibly
really
offer
something
interesting
served
from
a
550
ml
brown
bottle
pours
a
medium
golden
hue
with
a
significant
head
with
moderate
retention
leaves
a
pleasing
significant
lacing
aroma
is
malty
and
creamy
with
some
very
subtle
vanilla
notes
present
in
the
background
taste
is
very
well
balanced
with
a
nice
malty
character
set
off
by
hops
on
the
aftertaste
along
with
a
hint
more
of
vanilla
very
good
mouthfeel
full
and
creamy
with
a
satisfying
richness
all
in
all
this
is
a
very
drinkable
and
pleasant
beer
poured
from
a
brown
18
7
oz
bottle
has
a
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smeels
of
malts
a
bit
sweet
taste
is
crisp
malty
finishing
slightly
bitter
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
has
good
drinkability
overall
this
mkes
for
a
decent
selection
a
very
drinkable
clean
crisp
lager
does
more
need
to
be
said
it
is
nothing
complex
but
is
a
great
basic
beer
promising
nothing
more
a
clear
clean
bright
yellow
pour
with
a
small
bright
white
head
that
lessens
to
little
leaving
trace
lacing
thinbodied
but
crisp
clean
this
is
a
a
refreshing
lager
with
minimal
hops
basic
grainmalts
that
dont
try
be
more
than
that
a
nice
beer
to
down
after
a
tough
day
overall
really
unimpressed
somewhat
suprised
considering
their
organic
lager
is
fantastic
this
is
probably
an
old
bottle
it
sure
tastes
old
review
over
overall
this
is
the
kind
of
beer
you
could
give
to
your
bmc
swilling
friends
to
give
them
a
taste
of
whats
out
there
us
beer
geeks
have
seen
and
tasted
stuff
thats
way
more
exciting
but
sometimes
you
just
need
a
nice
simple
goodtasting
brew
without
pretense
this
is
that
kind
of
beer
cheers
drinkability
superb
proof
that
lager
doesnt
have
to
taste
like
abrasive
fizzy
water
there
is
no
hint
of
the
horrendous
metallic
taste
that
affects
the
vast
majority
euro
lagers
this
is
a
lager
that
should
be
on
tap
at
all
pubs
instead
of
the
generic
macro
crap
that
seem
to
dominate
its
hard
to
say
that
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
because
im
a
fan
of
bigger
darker
beers
but
for
what
it
is
its
quite
nice
i
usually
dont
like
lagers
but
this
was
very
clean
and
refreshing
it
pours
a
crystal
clear
straw
color
with
a
foamy
head
it
delicately
laced
the
glass
the
smell
was
very
clean
the
flavor
was
refreshing
consisting
of
light
grain
and
a
gentle
noble
hop
tartness
the
finish
was
crisp
and
dry
a
very
nice
pale
lager
that
i
will
drink
again
this
has
it
all
quite
consistently
a
nice
mild
apple
malt
nose
mild
sweet
fruit
with
a
woody
twit
earth
finish
thats
brisk
present
but
refreshingly
not
lingering
i
would
compare
it
closest
to
an
ayinger
jahrhundert
bier
quite
similar
i
think
im
going
to
even
do
a
parallel
tasting
this
week
seeing
as
i
like
both
so
much
d
certainly
sessionable
a
good
british
take
on
the
euro
style
pale
lager
d
moderately
high
to
insane
a
bit
pricey
but
worth
a
try
for
some
of
you
this
is
a
mustbuy
notes
could
use
a
little
more
carbonation
d
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
and
smooth
but
i
wasnt
expecting
that
much
sweetness
in
a
lager
it
was
nice
to
taste
some
lager
qualities
and
some
ale
qualities
and
have
a
good
depth
of
flavor
i
would
love
to
try
this
on
cask
next
time
i
hop
over
the
pond
this
is
a
very
refreshing
summery
type
lager
my
1st
thought
when
i
took
the
sip
was
me
lounging
in
the
pool
with
a
glass
of
it
it
is
very
flavorful
but
not
overly
complex
i
am
a
huge
fan
of
the
maltiness
pours
an
extremely
clear
extremely
pale
yellow
colored
body
with
a
huge
frothy
white
head
lasting
vegetably
aroma
corn
straw
malty
some
sweetness
too
like
something
i
cant
place
maybe
sweet
corn
corny
vegetably
taste
especially
in
the
aftertaste
sweet
taste
clean
refreshing
but
still
a
lager
carbonated
body
d
refreshing
extremely
drinkable
beer
could
have
many
of
these
without
being
overwhelmed
by
abv
or
taste
beer
drinkers
distinguished
by
candor
and
insight
boast
in
their
inborn
belief
in
the
superiority
of
samuel
smith
beers
this
lager
is
a
harbinger
of
success
it
is
teeming
with
life
it
is
unreservedly
unequivocally
and
absolutely
right
and
i
feel
called
upon
to
asseverate
that
samuel
smiths
brewed
lager
beer
will
flow
in
a
notable
way
amidst
the
mountains
of
god
i
would
say
so
in
the
presence
of
an
apostle
pours
a
nice
cleanclear
golden
yellow
color
nice
carbonation
very
nice
twofinger
plus
foamy
white
head
with
some
small
islands
and
sticky
lacing
left
behind
the
nose
is
malty
with
some
lemon
notes
slight
spice
the
taste
is
slightly
sweet
on
the
lips
malty
nice
little
citrus
note
with
a
slight
spice
medium
body
drinkable
this
is
a
nice
brew
offwhite
head
slowly
shrinks
on
top
of
the
clear
golden
yellow
body
this
really
is
an
amazing
lager
the
floral
and
herbal
hops
provide
just
the
right
amount
of
spice
and
bitterness
to
balance
the
sweetness
what
can
i
really
say
its
another
great
beer
from
what
is
in
my
opinion
one
of
the
best
breweries
this
lager
pours
a
brilliant
light
golden
color
with
a
moderate
fluffy
white
head
the
aroma
is
sweet
grain
and
floral
european
hops
quite
pleasant
the
taste
is
sweet
with
a
bit
of
grain
and
there
is
a
nice
hop
presence
to
balance
the
malt
the
finish
is
quenching
and
satisfying
overall
this
is
a
well
put
together
beer
with
some
nice
flavor
exceptional
tipple
drinkability
i
have
now
had
every
mainstream
us
imported
sammy
smith
brew
and
i
am
very
impressed
i
will
be
buying
many
of
these
in
the
future
of
course
anytime
you
have
good
memories
associated
with
a
good
beer
the
beer
becomes
one
of
your
alltime
favorites
consume
this
beer
when
you
want
some
good
memories
with
good
friends
cheers
will
keep
this
one
in
mind
as
one
of
the
better
lagers
like
its
organic
counterpart
this
is
clean
easy
to
drink
and
darn
good
and
they
taste
practically
the
same
as
well
hmmm
imagine
that
going
by
appearance
this
looks
just
like
any
standard
lager
id
bet
money
the
folks
here
on
ba
would
never
bee
able
to
tell
this
from
a
macro
however
in
every
other
category
this
is
a
full
step
or
two
up
its
not
an
over
the
top
hop
bomb
nor
a
heavy
ale
with
a
high
abv
its
just
a
very
pleasing
simple
beer
which
hits
the
spot
for
the
style
i
enjoy
this
beer
it
is
clean
crisp
grassy
flavorful
and
simple
not
every
beer
needs
to
have
a
quarter
pound
of
spices
or
a
half
cup
of
hops
poured
into
every
bottle
this
is
great
in
the
simplicity
of
it
good
session
beer
well
rounded
taste
easily
the
best
lager
i
have
had
another
great
offering
from
samuel
smith
d
im
not
a
big
fan
og
lagers
but
this
would
be
a
good
lager
to
give
to
friends
stuck
on
american
macro
lagers
crisp
refreshing
and
flavorful
good
thing
it
comes
in
the
bigger
size
bottle
cuz
it
goes
down
quickly
and
12oz
would
not
last
very
long
bottle
from
winking
lizard
this
beer
pours
a
clear
pale
orangegold
color
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
that
dissipates
quickly
spotty
lacing
the
aroma
is
mildly
hoppy
with
a
bit
of
malt
lightbodied
with
a
light
hops
and
malt
flavor
with
touches
of
grass
and
fruit
the
finish
is
lightly
hopped
and
short
overall
this
beer
is
rather
subpar
drinkabilityfinal
thoughts
one
could
find
themselves
drinking
copious
amounts
of
this
beer
at
least
i
sure
could
from
start
to
finish
this
beer
left
me
wanting
more
sip
by
sip
i
absolutely
loved
its
rich
caramel
start
and
dry
hopy
finish
this
was
my
first
samuel
smiths
beer
and
it
wont
be
my
last
i
definitely
recommend
you
try
this
you
wont
be
disappointed
cheers
drinkability
a
generally
pleasant
wellbalanced
lager
that
has
all
impure
brewed
lagers
beat
by
a
mile
future
outlook
i
look
forward
to
drinking
this
again
when
the
heat
returns
d
good
i
feel
like
after
a
little
time
i
would
want
something
a
little
more
interesting
bit
its
truely
one
of
the
best
lagers
around
the
first
from
my
samuel
smith
gift
pack
handpicked
by
uf
thanks
uf
larger
half
liter
bottle
decent
pale
yellow
color
and
nice
foamy
head
a
bit
hazy
with
light
carbonation
visible
fruity
hops
a
la
euro
lager
in
the
nose
with
malt
coming
through
in
the
first
sip
but
balanced
fairly
well
by
the
hops
as
euro
lagers
go
this
one
was
free
from
the
typical
skunk
smell
and
i
attribute
it
to
the
really
heavy
brown
bottle
it
came
in
quite
drinkable
and
enjoyable
but
not
particularly
complex
a
fresh
alternative
to
similar
styled
offerings
from
europe
d
this
lager
is
easy
to
drink
due
to
its
lightness
and
thinness
its
got
the
typical
watery
taste
that
makes
it
easy
to
down
a
few
from
a
brown
bottle
pours
a
very
light
pale
yellow
with
almost
no
head
or
carbonation
smells
of
sweet
malts
with
just
a
tad
of
light
hops
first
sip
is
sweet
with
very
little
hops
coming
through
pretty
much
flavorless
finishes
slightly
bitter
well
under
carbonated
not
much
happening
here
worth
skipping
this
one
d
easily
a
sessionable
beer
this
would
be
case
worthy
in
my
eyes
i
dont
say
that
too
often
i
nice
beer
for
the
weekends
for
football
go
steelers
poured
with
a
nice
head
and
some
lace
has
a
nice
light
malty
aroma
pleasing
gold
color
nice
body
very
well
balanced
not
a
lot
of
flavor
super
subtle
clean
just
not
a
lot
there
finish
is
similar
to
the
rest
guess
its
not
bad
kind
of
boring
i
like
all
the
other
sam
smiths
a
lot
more
this
beer
feels
more
like
a
thirst
quencher
to
me
something
you
would
drink
after
a
hard
days
work
out
in
the
yard
and
or
while
grilling
out
side
on
a
hot
summer
day
you
can
also
include
fishing
on
that
list
overall
this
is
an
aboveaverage
pale
lager
but
nothing
that
will
amaze
anybody
hops
and
yeast
on
the
nose
a
classic
straw
gold
color
in
the
glass
typical
s
s
perfect
frothy
head
that
displays
great
retention
and
laces
like
a
champ
smooth
on
the
tongue
with
a
good
mouthfeel
lightly
carbonated
flavors
are
nice
but
a
little
watered
down
some
hops
and
subtle
malt
clean
crisp
finish
very
refreshing
not
my
favorite
style
but
a
great
example
of
what
a
lager
should
be
sam
smith
based
on
this
and
past
offerings
is
a
fairly
formidable
brewery
and
i
am
always
on
the
hunt
for
their
beers
not
a
powerhouse
brew
by
any
means
this
one
reminds
me
very
much
of
rogues
kells
irish
lager
and
thats
a
good
thing
thanks
for
the
12oz
bottle
mom
and
dad
pours
a
light
clear
amber
with
a
quick
eggshell
had
that
very
quickly
recedes
the
aroma
is
a
very
musty
toasted
malt
the
taste
is
pretty
bready
with
some
light
floral
hops
very
musty
adjuncty
palate
with
maybe
a
littl
citrus
here
and
there
i
have
been
a
fan
of
samuel
smiths
oatmeal
stoat
for
quite
some
time
and
after
recommendations
to
try
this
i
was
not
disappointed
in
the
slightest
i
still
can
not
believe
how
very
smooth
the
drink
is
definitely
is
one
of
the
best
lagers
i
have
ever
had
the
pleasure
of
drinking
i
can
now
believe
that
samuel
smith
breweries
can
do
no
wrong
with
their
beer
making
highly
recommended
if
you
enjoy
lagers
and
this
will
get
my
highest
grade
yet
poured
with
a
darker
shade
of
gold
with
a
thick
head
at
first
that
settled
to
a
creamy
lacing
on
top
and
throughout
the
glass
aromas
are
a
bit
thin
but
apparent
of
biscuity
hops
and
more
of
a
floral
sense
that
its
organic
counterpart
taste
is
much
sweeter
than
smiths
organic
lager
with
an
almost
spiced
herby
aspect
to
it
mouthfeel
is
still
superb
with
a
great
crispness
balance
and
lightness
that
does
not
at
all
take
away
taste
overall
i
preferred
the
organic
one
more
for
its
consistency
but
the
pure
lager
from
samuel
smith
still
has
great
dimensions
mfd
very
crisp
and
clean
tasting
thin
bodied
and
extremely
drinkable
if
you
like
pilsner
you
have
to
try
this
lager
strange
to
have
bought
a
british
lagerhere
goes
pours
a
bubbly
transparent
golden
body
with
a
swiftly
thinning
white
headlooks
pure
aroma
is
reminiscent
of
of
an
eastern
block
pilsnercrisp
sharp
malts
and
perfumy
yeast
fullbodied
yet
pleasantly
mouthwatering
and
satisfying
with
a
butterysmooth
presence

texture
malt
is
soft
and
sweetbalanced
with
a
mellowness
that
invites
another
lagers
are
tough
to
argue
against
when
they
present
little
flaw
and
the
samuel
smith
brewers
arent
about
to
offer
a
secondrate
anything
apparently
clean
and
crisp
as
a
lager
should
be
another
excellent
offering
from
samuel
smiths
found
this
at
a
nice
little
spot
in
dunedinfl
kellys
beautiful
crisp
golden
near
perfect
looking
the
smell
was
sweet
and
grainy
as
was
the
taste
very
drinkableon
the
highest
levels
i
could
enjoy
this
flavorful
lager
again
and
againand
i
will
next
time
i
see

i
pickedup
this
very
good
lager
at
the
grapevine
in
pocatello
idaho
it
came
in
a
brown
12oz
bottle
this
is
a
very
tasty
lager
id
say
that
its
a
very
good
brew
actually
i
said
it
very
tasty
nice
and
simple
lager
really
nice
head
that
stuck
around
for
a
bit
enjoyed
it
while
gardening
plain
and
simple
this
samuel

pure

great

this
all

the
complex

it
so
delicious

slightly
dry
overall
i
dig
it
for
the
style
this
is
top
notch
cheers
enjoyed
everything
from
sam
smith
want
to
try
more
just
goes
to
show
you
can
make
great
beer
with
reasonable
alc
and
non
imperial
huge
beer
d
ive
recently
become
a
big
fan
of
the
samuel
smith
family
of
beers
but
this
was
a
big
dissappointment
not
much
substance
other
then
a
nice
aroma
d
the
finish
was
clean
making
for
a
decent
lager
with
pizza
d
damn
near
perfect
world
class
euro
lager
tadcaster
has
obviously
lent
some
of
its
ale
techniques
to
the
making
of
this
one
and
the
result
is
a
wonderfully
flavorful
uniquely
complex
beer
the
likes
of
which
i
could
have
never
imagined
im
not
one
for
this
style
but
my
favorite
english
brewery
continues
to
amaze
me
drinkability
is
excellent
this
is
a
light
bodied
lager
with
excellent
flavors
and
aromas
and
a
rich
profile
despite
its
light
mouthfeel
another
excellent
brew
from
samuel
smith
cheers
the
beer
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
thin
white
lace
head
the
aroma
is
decent
it
boasts
primarily
of
pale
malts
and
lager
yeast
with
a
mild
hop
scent
the
taste
is
good
it
is
clean
and
refreshing
it
has
largely
a
pale
malt
flavor
with
a
light
hop
taste
it
is
light
and
highly
drinkable
this
is
a
low
bodied
beer
with
decent
carbonation
this
is
the
best
lager
you
will
have
this
is
the
best
lager
you
can
find
other
than
the
organic
from
sam
smith
this
wasnt
a
bad
beer
but
it
might
be
the
least
interesting
offering
ive
tried
from
samuel
smiths
i
assume
that
perhaps
the
style
itself
isnt
all
that
interesting
and
smiths
brewed
one
of
the
better
examples
the
taste
is
fullbodied
grain
that
lasts
all
the
way
through
with
herb
and
grass
elements
providing
a
nice
tingly
herbal
bitterness
that
smoothly
blends
with
the
sweet
malt
body
one
of
the
better
lightlagers
i
have
had
verdict
cant
go
wrong
with
this
lager
clean
crisp
grass
hops
are
balanced
very
well
with
malted
barley
for
a
balanced
flavor
no
hints
of
vegetable
or
tin
sometimes
found
in
euro
lagers
its
not
going
to
blow
anyone
away
but
there
is
something
to
be
said
for
its
quality
of
ingredients
thin
and
carbonated
mouthfeel
and
highly
drinkable
very
enjoyable
lager
from
sam
smith
d
this
is
a
pretty
good
euro
pale
lager
much
better
than
others
of
this
style
good
beer
for
sure
just
probably
way
out
of
range
on
expenditures
if
we
are
talking
about
a
daily
drink
i
wish
i
could
brew
an
english
lager
this
well
but
i
will
probably
only
buy
it
again
if
i
am
brewing
this
style
overall
i
wouldnt
say
this
is
absolutely
my
favorite
beer
but
its
really
quite
incredible
i
enjoy
beer
thats
not
very
dark
or
fruity
or
spicy
or
sweet
like
i
said
im
anh
allamerican
macro
lager
kind
of
guy
but
this
is
what
macro
lagers
strive
to
be
theyre
just
unbalanced
at
some
point
i
admit
this
is
no
perfect
beer
but
wow
balanced
smooth
delicious
expensive
eric
i
like
most
beer
nerds
talk
the
talk
about
appreciating
light
lager
style
beers
but
when
it
comes
to
walking
the
walk
tend
to
only
really
enjoy
big
high
alcohol
ales
this
is
an
amazing
lager
what
you
imagine
budweiser
tasted
like
before
prohibition
full
rich
malt
buttery
yummy
and
oh
so
clean
i
may
never
buy
another
regular
lager
again
on
the
whole
this
was
a
little
disappointing
to
me
while
ive
certainly
had
worse
beers
i
expected
a
much
richer
more
complex
beer
from
sam
smith
it
was
like
they
were
intent
on
imitating
lesser
more
mainstream
beers
poured
with
a
nice
bubbly
head
mostly
small
bubbles
with
a
few
fisheyes
the
brew
is
a
crisp
clear
golden
yellow
smells
of
citrus
and
hoppy
maybe
a
little
too
sweet
in
my
opinion
the
taste
is
clean
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
there
is
a
sweet
maltiness
to
it
but
it
maintains
a
nice
hoppy
bite
it
finishes
pretty
sweet
but
dies
off
quickly
leaving
nothing
but
a
hoppy
bite
on
my
tongue
definitely
not
my
favorite
sam
smith
but
a
great
lager
in
my
opinion
and
sometimes
thats
exactly
what
i
want
simple
slightly
honey
sweet
subtle
malt
smell
with
a
doughy
tang
and
yeasty
sweaty
breadiness
short
to
medium
lasting
bright
white
head
taste
is
simple
somewhat
light
but
quite
good
with
a
semi
quick
finish
and
a
touch
of
lingering
sweetness
nicely
carbonated
and
a
very
good
simple
easy
to
drink
lager
nothing
that
will
blow
your
socks
off
probably
but
a
tasty
lager
an
average
brew
in
all
respects
sampled
many
selections
from
samuel
smith
that
i
really
like
and
this
was
probably
the
weakest
pours
an
applejuice
color
with
no
froth
and
a
slight
carbonation
present
not
a
very
appealing
appearance
smell
was
almost
nonexistent
very
bland
as
was
the
taste
which
was
nondescript
and
slightly
watery
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
were
also
about
average
just
wanted
to
try
this
one
because
all
of
the
other
samuel
smith
brews
were
great
this
one
was
a
miss
not
recommended
this
beer
still
wont
make
me
a
lager
fan
d
very
easy
to
put
down
and
enjoyable
to
boot
12
ounce
bottle

for
a
single
bottle
at
andersons
east
columbus
served
in
a
sam
adams
bl
glass
the
beer
pours
a
yellowgold
color
with
an
inch
offwhite
head
head
retention
and
lacing
are
both
good
it
smells
like
sweet
malt
and
grain
and
nothing
else
from
what
i
can
tell
but
it
is
a
nice
clean
aroma
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
but
theres
also
some
herbalgrassy
hops
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
light
with
medium
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
it
goes
down
pretty
easy
and
its
nonoffensive
its
a
decent
beer
overall
but
for
the
price
i
dont
think
its
a
good
deal
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
seek
it
out
but
i
would
drink
it
again
its
not
a
bad
lager
at
all
sweet
taste
of
malt
finishes
dry
and
crisp
body
is
a
bit
watery
the
only
drawback
nice
drinker
but
a
bit
pricey
with
the
import
fees
bummer
there
mouthfeeldrinkability
the
near
perfect
texture
in
the
mouth
is
fantastic
and
the
best
part
of
this
tasting
smooth
and
rolling
it
becomes
soft
like
seafoam
and
goes
down
easy
it
complements
the
effortless
balance
of
pure
ingredients
and
would
make
a
good
pairing
with
everyday
simple
cuisine
from
pizza
to
sushi
this
beer
lets
the
food
do
the
talking
a
substantial
beer
but
has
too
many
tastes
in
it
that
should
not
be
in
a
lager
although
it
is
well
made
and
satisfying
this
is
a
high
quality
lager
that
is
very
easy
to
drink
but
slightly
on
the
light
and
thin
side
otherwise
worth
its
3
49
price
tag
one
of
the
most
solid
euro
pale
lagers
ive
had
seems
to
possess
a
bit
more
substance
than
many
others
not
particularly
memorable
thus
with
the
price
tag
it
doesnt
warrant
being
an
everyday
beer
but
its
definitely
one
to
try
smooth
and
mostly
clean
this
lighttomedium
bodied
lager
is
a
nice
tasty
refreshing
brew
final
statement
definately
the
least
exciting
sam

ive
had
to
date
theres
definately
better
lagers
out
there

a
very
good

a
tasty
english
lager
that
surprised
me
by
how
much
i
liked
it
i
see
this
being
a
good
gateway
beer
but
its
not
something
id
quaff
regularly
especially
if
samuel
smiths
oatmeal
stout
or
nut
brown
ale
is
sitting
right
next
to
it
at
the
store
output
the
label
is
gorgeous
tasty
very
very
beery
as
in
theres
nothing
special
about
this
brew
just
drink
it
but
for
about
9
a
4pack
around
here
why
would
you
drink
it
unless
money
is
falling

your
anus
pours

taste
is

a
nice
nobel

kick
very
similar
to
a
fine
pilsner
very
simple
form
of
a
lager
crisp
light
and
very
refreshing
the
feel
is
light
and
a
bit
watery
finishes
a
tad
dry
this
is
the
ultimate
in
a
summer
brew
though
it
is
not
a
summer
brew
very
drinkable
and
no
odd
flavors
to
get
in
the
way
a
very
fine
lager
from
a
very
fine
brewery
pours
a
lighter
pale
of
yellow
with
a
nice
head
no
lacing
a
nice
aroma
with
no
skunkiness
this
is
a
little
on
the
thin
side
as
far
as
body
goes
it
could
be
a
little
bit
more
dense
but
it
isnt
the
taste
is
a
bit
citrusy
i
think
somewhat
lemony
with
the
hops
coming
through
in
the
middle
you
can
taste
a
wheatiness
or
as
some
would
call
it
a
grassiness
in
the
malt
the
aftertaste
is
mild
and
the
beer
does
mellow
as
it
warms
its
a
good
lager
you
wont
go
wrong
it
is
truly
solid
but
i
wouldnt
call
it

to
give

have
to

em

decent

pours
from
the
bottle
a
deep
shade
of
gold
with
a
white
foamy
head
that
rises
up
quickly
maintains
very
good
lacing
and
a
nice
layer
of
head
throughout
the
beer
light
fruity
smell
with
good
mouth
feel
but
i
think
it
fell
a
little
flat
on
the
finish
i
agree
with
other
reviewers
here
this
beer
is
a
quality
lager
but
cannot
quite
compare
to
the
quality
usually
offered
from
this
brewer
which
by
the
way
is
incredibly
high
a
decent
beer
but
average
when
compared
to
other
good
lagers
poured
from
the
bottle
to
a
golden
yellow
with
thick
snow
white
head
and
good
lacing
both
bottles
i
had
have
foamed
out
the
top
upon
opening
so
im
not
sure
if
it
is
the
beer
or
handling
aroma
is
fruity
mostly
lemons
with
a
hint
of
floral
hops
flavor
is
harder
to
pinpoint
althogh
it
is
tasty
and
mold
with
a
smooth
fiinish
although
not
as
highly
touted
as
some
of
its
samuel
smith
relatives
it
is
one
of
my
favorites
from
that
brewer
so
far
i
love
samuel
smith
beers
but
unfortunately
this
does
not
live
up
to
the
incredibly
high
standards
of
this
brewery
a
nice
appearance
and
mouthfeel
but
there
seems
to
be
a
bit
missing
that
prevents
this
beer
from
being
the
usual
treat
that
samuel
smith
provides
just
seeing
the
name
on
the
label
makes
me
crave
an
oatmeal
stout
so
i
plan
on
passing
on
this
one
in
the
future
to
move
on
to
the
other
well
crafted
brews
from
this
company
notes
although
im
a
huge
fan
of
samuel
smiths
this
is
the
one
offering
ill
pass
on
a
nice
very
drinkable
lager
american
macros
should
take
note
overall
an
enjoyable
brew
when
in
the
mood
for
lighter
lagers
worth
having
again
pours
clear
pale

good

taste
is
dry
and
crisp
with
malt
and
grassy
flavors
that
finish
clean
overall
an
enjoyable
brew
when
in
the
mood
for
lagers
this
is
definately
one
of
the
best
lagers
that
i
have
tried
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
very
drinkable
and
certainly
worth
a
try
550ml
bottle
this
one
pours
a
crystal
clear
golden
color
with
only
a
small
head
on
it
the
aroma
was
slightly
floral
but
very
weak
it
was
difficult
to
make
anything
else
out
of
it
the
taste
was
quite
nondescript
like
the
aroma
it
was
ok
but
very
bland
certainly
not
worth
the
price
of
a
premium
beer
opinion
this
is
a
really
good
beer
and
i
would
probably
appreciate
it
more
on
a
really
hot
summer
day
this
isnt
a
lawnmower
beer
as
it
has
too
much
body
and
flavor
this
is
a
light
flavored
beer
but
could
not
be
used
to
rehydrate
this
is
a
front
porch
kind
of
beer
and
one
that
i
definitely
would
like
to
drink
again
the
beer
pours
a
nice
gold
color
with
a
thick
and
creamy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
wonderful
pale
malt
scent
that
is
a
bit
sweet
and
bisquity
it
also
has
a
dry
and
earthy
english
ale
yeast
aroma
as
well
as
a
light
noble
hop
aroma
the
taste
is
decent
it
has
a
sweet
and
creamy
pale
malt
flavor
that
goes
down
slow
and
finishes
dry
and
slightly
hoppy
its
sweet
in
the
flavor
but
bisquity
and
earthy
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
also
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
good
lager
but
it
has
a
little
too
much
body
for
my
tastes
this
is
my
least
favorite
sam
smith
brew
overall
this
is
reminding
me
a
bit
of
meads
as
much
as
it
does
beer
this
beer
is
very
clean
and
crisp
perhaps
its
too
well
crafted
for
me
to
want
to
drink
rather
than
savor
pours
out
pale
golden
with
a
loose
white
head
smells
of
honey
and
hefty
malt
with
a
nuttiness
in
the
background
tastes
of
bready
sweet
malts
with
an
aggressive
hoppiness
that
offsets
the
malt
perfectly
this
tastes
distinctly
samuel
smith
and
i
cant
figure
out
why
i
thought
at
first
that
it
might
be
the
yeast
strain
but
would
they
use
said
yeast
strain
for
their
lagers
too
mouthfeel
is
extremely
smooth
for
a
pale
lager
but
feels
a
tad
too
sticky
in
the
finish
this
is
an
excellent
beer
from
the
great
tadcaster
brewery
without
a
doubt
this
is
the
best
lager
ive
ever
had
beer
poured
a
nice
golden
color
with
a
thick
head
it
had
a
nice
honey
smell
and
the
taste
was
sweet
honey
with
an
easy
hoppy
bitter
aftertaste
it
had
less
carbonation
than
i
expected
it
had
a
decent
mouthfeel
but
was
a
little
watery
at
the
end
drinkability
not
too
shabby
i
could
sit
down
with
a
few
of
these

dry
taste
somewhat
bitter
malt
and
hops
both
very
subtle
good
lager
if
a
bit
weak
i
could
drink
it
again
but
overall
its
kind
of
boring
d
definite
session
beer
if
you
want
a
euro
lager
then
this
is
it
stronger
than
american
lagers
but
still
classic
in
its
taste
very
clean
refreshing
and
drinkable
tastes
fresher
most
the
lagers
ive
tasted
from
europe
lately
try

its

am
going
to

a

rather
indistinctive

for
the

i
can
do
better
probably
the
benchmark
lager
md
very
lively
on
the
mouthfeel
and
almost
fullbodied
but
leaving
no
sugary
or
sticky
residual
taste
in
the
endcrisply
clean
in
the
finish
making
this
beer
taste
just
the
way
a
quality
lager
should
be
like
the
draughttap
version
definitely
has
the
upperhand
over
the
bottled
one
this
beer
proves
the
quality
of
ss
to
make
not
just
great
ales
but
very
decent
lagers
as
well
but
their
ayinger
range
of
lagers
brewed
under
license
are
not
impressive
though
dont
know
why
whether
i
pay
5
a
bottle
or
2
i
still
cannot
find
a
decent
euro
pale
lager
that
i
will
order
time
and
time
again
even
though
samuel
smith
makes
some
pretty
fine
beers
this
one
doesnt
do
anything
for
me
though
better
than
your
heineken
or
anything
produced
in
italy
it
still
seems
basic
plain
and
flat
personally
kroenenbourg
is
a
better
and
more
economically
feasible
choice
overall
i
like
this
almost
like
a
maltier
version
of
the
organic
lagar
something
about
the
organic
that
was
more
enjoyable
a
step
down
from
the
organic
lager
and
ale
but
still
a
charming
beer
notes
im
not
so
into
this
its
better
than
most
lagers
but
im
not
so
into
this
type
of
beer
personally
wouldnt
recommend
it
unless
youre
really
really
into
lagers

brew
would
be
great
with
some
fish
cheese
salad
etc
etc
a
pleasant
and
flavorful
lager
in
all
honesty
i
dislike
this
style
but
this
version
is
actually
quite
tasty
id
be
happy
to
grab
another
one
the
next
time
im
in
the
mood
for
a
lager
went
down
quickly
great
summer
brew
i
dont
taste
much
difference
between
samuel
smiths
pure
brewed
lager
and
organically
produced
lager
i
would
think
that
the
word
pure
would
apply
more
to
the
organic
beer
but
pesticideenhanced
probably
didnt
make
it
past
the
marketing
department
this
is
a
decent
drinkable
lager
i
still
havent
found
an
epl
that
does
much
for
me
though
pours
a
straw
gold
with
a
nice
white
head
and
active
carbonation
a
nice
looking
lager
nose
is
grassy
with
some
very
faint
spicy
peppery
notes
nice
biscuity
malt
in
the
taste
with
some
grassy
hops
in
the
finish
not
terribly
complex
but
its
simplicity
is
quite
pleasant
good
mouthfeel
with
the
carbonation
not
too
aggressive
a
drinkable
lager
and
a
good
standby
if
you
need
a
bit
of
a
break
picked
up
at
a
relatively
good
price
so
i
figured
that
i
would
try
it
pours
a
light
golden
color
with
a
quickly
retreating
white
head
that
leaves
a
nice
lacing
down
the
side
of
my
sam
smith
pint
glass
smell
is
faint
but
grassy
and
slightly
peppery
taste
is
very
clean
with
a
slight
european
hop
bite
that
finishes
very
subtle
super
drinkable
nice
beer
but
nothing
complex
at
all
hence
the
uber
short
review
its
very
smooth
and
refreshing
and
surprisingly
complex
for
a
lager
pours
a
deep
golden
with
a
thin
but
quickly
dissipating
head
aroma
is
a
mixture
of
sweet
doughy
malt
and
some
grassy
hops
flavor
is
begins
with
sweet
malt
which
is
balanced
by
some
grassy
and
herbal
bitterness
in
the
finish
moutfeel
is
light
and
the
carbonation
is
quite
low
for
the
style
this
is
a
solid
if
unspectacular
brew
although
for
the
price
i
dont
think
its
one
ill
be
buying
again
i
can
find
many
local
craftbrewed
pilsners
or
dortmunders
that
are
more
satisfying
than
this
one
and
they
are
all
less
expensive

for
a
12oz
bottle
from
northend
superette
manchester
nh
i
really
enjoy
samuel
smith
brews
but
this
one
i
can
do
without
pours
out
to
your
typical
lager
golden
yellow
with
medium
carbonation
and
a
short
lived
white
head
medium
odor
of
hay
and
barley
tastes
a
bit
watered
down
with
flavors
of
hops
and
stale
malt
a
touch
of
sweetness
on
the
finish
not
one
of
my
favorites
but
possibly
more
akin
to
those
who
have
a
more
developed
palate
go
for
the
oatmeal
stout
for
what
i
would
call
a
good
brew
poured
a
straw
color
thin
sudsy
head
with
little
retention
smell
was
fairly
interesting
light
hop
aroma
fruit
as
well
taste
was
light
hop
and
fruity
tang
mouthfeel
was
thin
and
watery
not
the
best
sam
ive
had
but
beats
the
shit
outta
a
bud
drinkability
is
good
i
would
have
another
but
with
all
the
other
great
varieties
of
sam
smith
it
could
take
me
awhile
to
get
back
to
this
one
this
was
from
their
550ml
bottle
i
liked
the
green
and
gold
foil
around
the
top
for
whatever
thats
worth
it
poured
a
nice
pale
gold
with
a
decent
head
that
left
quickly
there
was
a
nice
balance
of
malt
and
hops
a
little
grassy
aroma
and
flavor
i
did
a
side
by
side
with
thier
organic
lager
and
i
must
admit
that
even
though
i
feel
we
ingest
way
too
many
unnecessary
chemicalsthis
was
a
much
better
tasting
lager
there
seemed
it
had
better
carbonation
and
overall
much
more
satisfying
as
a
lager
drinker
i
will
definitely
try
this
one
again
overall
yet
another
fantastic
brew
from
samuel
smiths
a
true
classic
a
bit
on
the
pricey
side
but
well
worth
it
a
nice
refreshing
lager
similar
but
slightly
different
to
the
organic
lager
very
drinkable
for
me
personally
i
would
much
rather
bye
a
4
pack
of
the
taddy
porter
or
either
of
the
samuel
smiths
stouts
overall
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
offering
this
is
a
very
drinkable
lager
or
would
be
if
not
for
the
price
a
sixer
of
this
would
put
you
well
on
the
way
to
20
bucks
acceptable
in
a
bar
perhaps
but
not
when
youre
buying
it
in
a
store
this
beer
goes
down
easy
and
its
relatively
mild
abv
guarantees
a
seasoned
drinker
several
with
no
dire
consequences
beautiful
sparkling
yellow
with
one
of
the
most
impressive
heads
i
have
ever
seen
on
a
lagerpils
full
breadlike
aroma
with
a
nice
dose
of
grassy
hop
taste
followed
suit
and
did
not
disappoint
very
well
balanced
a
nice
hop
intro
that
backed
of
quickly
to
a
clean
finish

was
frothy
and
full

english
lager
tally
ho
this
brew
is
a
clear
strawgold
color
brew
with
a
nice
white
foam
head
topping
it
off
not
much
of
an
aroma
that
i
can
detect
other
than
some
malty
bits
the
front
is
all
light
sweet
malt
some
light
hop
action
in
the
back
dry
finish
light
to
medium
bodied
nice
light
refreshing
lager
but
besides
being
good
for
the
style
this
brew
isnt
my
all
time
favorite
overall
impression
a
good
lager
im
not
doing
back
flips
but
maybe
that
is
just
a
quality
of
the
style
more
than
the
beer
this
might
be
a
good
one
to
wean
the
macro
crowd
with
overall
it
was
drinkable
certainly
you
could
drink
a
few
without
being
overwhelmed
but
there
really
wasnt
anything
to
recommend
this
particular
lager
of
any
other
picked
up
cheap
due
to
it
just
hitting
its
used
by
absolutely
nothing
wrong
with
it
a
class
beer
through
and
through
will
be
back
for
some
more
i
try
to
avoid
mentioning
price
on
reviews
but
given
the
premium
required
to
acquire
this
beer
in
america
id
recommend
other
similar
beer
before
this
one
its
worthy
of
a
taste
to
let
you
decide
whether
it
works
for
you
two
fingers
of
white
noisy
rocky
head
leave
arcs
and
swoops
of
lacing
the
beer
is
a
clear
pale
gold
the
nose
is
really
quite
floral
with
lots
of
sugar
and
corn
syrup
aromas
echoed
in
the
front
a
pleasant
goldeny
malt
middle
finish
is
quite
nicely
bitter
hoppy
somewhat
grainsy
this
is
just
a
good
fresh
sweet
lager
medium
yellow
clear
hue
with
a
middling
head
thats
a
skim
after
a
minute
good
lacing
complicated
patterns
aroma
is
lightly
grassy
some
sense
of
musty
notes
a
little
like
modeling
clay
dry
flavor
wellbalanced
in
medium
hopping
with
light
but
equal
shortbread
and
slight
almond
characteristics
carbonation
is
lively
and
about
right
nose
was
slightly
off
for
me
flavor
meets
qualitylager
characters
and
the
mouthfeel
works
well
seems
slightly
less
buttery
than
sam
smiths
organicallyproduced
lager
its
been
ages
this
pours
out
a
clear
golden
with
fat
white
head
the
nose
is
light
some
malt
here
light
hopping
there
smells
a

grainy
taste
wise
lemony
raw
grains
straw
different
a
light

bitterness
finishes
things
off
strong
carbonation
makes
it
crisp
this
is
a
refresing
beer
pretty
drinkable
not
my
favorite
lager
and
a
bit
different
than
what
i
usually
like
but
not
bad
either
the
pale
lager
poured
a
bright
gold
with
a
thin
white
head
that
settled
down
to
an
oily
lace
it
smelled
of
malt
and
hops
with
a
slight
citric
aroma
it
is
slightly
malty
with
just
the
right
amount
of
hops
and
features
a
dry
finish
with
a
minty
flavor
the
feel
is
smooth
and
oily
with
a
dry
finish
this
lager
has
a
beautiful
blend
of
malt
and
hops
this
is
a
beer
that
will
find
its
way
to
my
table
again
and
again
super
drinkable
too
bad
it
is
a
bit
expensive
despite
the
slightness
of
malt
character
the
beer
is
not
particulary
dry
the
flavor
has
none
of
the
astringency
that
one
associates
with
north
american
allmalt
lagers
but
there
isnt
the
maltybreadyness
of
many
of
the
german
lagers
theres
nothing
like
a
wellbalanced
beer
i
am
almost
embarrassed
to
say
this
is
a
beer
i
recommend
trying
oh
im
turning
into
a
diry
yuppie
overall
this
is
so
watery
it
goes
down
quickly
maybe
a
good
beer
for
drinking
games
or
quenching
your
thirst
after
playing
tennis
but
not
a
beer
drinkers
beer
anyways
it
is
very
good
and
drinkable
and
thats
about
it
if
ever
im
a
millionare
i
think
the
first
thing
ill
do
is
buy
a
bunch
of
sam
smith
and
drink
it
as
a
session
beer
what
a
night
that
would
be
i
would
have
to
say
that
this
beer
did
remind
me
of
some
czech
pilseners
that
ive
had
namely
pilsner
urquell
and
czechvar
this
beer
is
almost
too
quaffable
if
there
ever
was
such
a
thing
i
think
this
would
complement
a
chicken
dish
very
well
quite
simply
one
of
the
best
pale
lagers
ive
had
light
copper
in
appearance
well
developed
head
but
didnt
last
but
a
few
minutesdue
to
my
glass
smell
was
very
subtle
to
me
it
was
a
slight
hoppines
aroma
taste
was
quite
smooth
and
mellow
very
easy
to
enjoy
almost
tastes
of
pears
of
some
other
fruit
i
couldnt
quite
put
my
finger
on
it
it
really
is
a
lovely
lager
i
didnt
emphasize
it
in
my
initial
review
but
the
grain
here
is
just
terrific
it
makes
the
beer
imho
this
is
so
much
better
than
the
standard
fare
its
not
even
funny
way
to
go
sam
smith
this
lager
is
one
of
favorites
of
the
style
appearance
is
a
rich
amber
with
a
fluffy
white
head
that
retains
and
laces
well
a
pleasant
aroma
of
grasses
malts
and
hops
taste
is
on
par
for
the
style
and
is
very
well
balanced
with
the
expected
hops
finish
great
session
lager
and
a
must
try
whether
one
is
into
the
style
or
not
a
very
nice
english
style
lager
that
is
pleasing
to
the
eye
and
to
the
palate
the
clear
golden
body
is
topped
by
a
semilasting
white
head
that
does
very
light
lacing
of
the
glass
the
lighlty
malty
nose
is
mild
and
noncomplex
bringing
forth
the
typical
lager
aroma
the
flavor
is
subdued
and
malty
but
dry
at
the
start
and
through
the
finish
very
mild
bittering
and
clean
fresh

i
really
had
to
give
it
a

this
beer
is
amazingly

pleasant
but
not
great
i
guess
i
one
never
knows
what
to
expect
frrom
a
generic
lager
but
i
was
expecting
something
more
more
color
more

more
anything
so
what
is
this
beer
i
imagine
this
is
what
heineken
would
taste
if
it
was
unskunked
and
fresh
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
worth
the
high
price
i
really
enjoyed
this
lager
it
drinks
well
and
is

slightly
more

it

for
an
epic
battle
which
is
ultimately
just
won
by
the
hops
army
the
finish
is
crisp
but
doesnt
leave
your
tongue
feeling
dry
the
complexity
of
the
competing
flavors
makes
for
a
fantastic
taste
interrupted
by
nothing
as
the
malted
barley
and
hops
in
this
beer
are
organic
it
clearly
makes
a
difference
i
would
enjoy
this
beer
in
the
company
of
the
most
boring
and
annoying
people
in
the
world
o
good
choice
for
a
lager
organic
ingredients
found
at
local
craft
beer
shop
for
4
99pint
poured
a
clear
golden
yellow
with
very
little
white
head
that
quickly
receded
to
a
ring
of
white
abundant
carbonation
bubbles
could
be
seen
going
up
the
glass
very
nice
looking
and
true
to
style
scents
of
lager
yeast
grainy
malt
and
slight
earthy
hops
a
simple
but
well
rounded
and
bright
aroma
very
suitable
to
the
style
quite
pleasant
taste
begins
with
sweet
malt
moving
into
some
grainy
and
bready
malt
in
the
middle
before
finishing
with
sweet
malt
and
slight
hints
of
hops
the
aftertaste
is
sweet
with
faint
undertones
of
herbal
earthy
hops
a
good
crisp
bright
flavor
befitting
a
pale
lager
maybe
a
touch
on
the
sweet
side
and
needing
a
little
bit
more
hops
but
otherwise
quite
good
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
moderatehigh
carbonation
and
a
crisp
feel
very
nice
quite
easy
to
drink
overall
this
is
a
good
lager
with
a
nice
refreshing
aroma
and
flavor
profile
my
only
complaint
is
the
relatively
low
hop
character
but
otherwise
its
a
nice
beer
im
generally
a
bit
intolerant
of
this
style
but
this
is
actually
fairly
drinkable
its
definitely
one
of
the
better
blond
lagers
ive
experienced
though
id
choose
a
german
pilsner
over
this
any
day
pours
a
clear
pale
yellow
nice
effervescence
pristine
2
inch
white
head
light
hops
barley
smell
with
some
flowery
notes
very
smooth
slightly
sweet
taste
no
bitterness
the
hops
barley
malt
are
very
well
balanced
mouth
feel
medium
carbonation
light
bodied
overall
a
pleasant
surprise
and
a
nice
break
from
the
heavier
beers
ive
been
leaning
toward
lately
i
almost
passed
this
one
up
glad
i
didnt
this
is
a
very
light
flavored
lager
more
so
than
i
like
but
its
very
easy
drinking
heres
a
solid
lager
delicious
overall
i
think
this
may
be
one
of
my
new
favorite
session
beers
ill
revisit
this
one
quite
often
this
is
a
world
class
lager
in
my
book
probably
the
best
euro
lager
ive
sampled
samuel
smith
makes
another
masterpiece
and
is
a
brewery
that
is
certainly
one
of
the
best
on
the
planet
from
now
on
every
lager
i
taste
will
be
compared
to
the
bruerys
humulus
so
im
sorry
to
all
the
well
made
generic
lagers
you
will
never
be
the
same
to
me
this
one
though
is
quite
good
for
what
it
is
absolutely
not
a
mind
bender
but
a
solid
beer
no
doubt
pours
dead
clear
golden
with
an
inch
of
lasting
white
airy
head
the
thing
about
this
though
is
that
theres
a
launch
point
a
central
feature
of
my
glass
thats
rocketing
spiraling
bubbles
hurriedly
to
the
surface
forever
it
wont
stop
and
its
sexy
the
nose
is
straight
lager
yeast
over
a
light
malt
body
no
inspirational
but
well
done
the
flavor
is
the
same
with
some
decent
bittering
hops
and
that
crispness
that
any
good
lager
needs
with
one
sip
left
in
my
glass
the
bubbles
are
still
sprinting
to
the
surface
its
so
awesome
a
littler
herbal
a
little
hoppy
a
true
euro
lager
better
than
almost
all
of
them
plus
its
organic
so
props
for
that
light
body
super
soft
and
clean
like
a
swiffer
overall
a
solid
brew
not
as
fun
as
the
stouts
and
stuff
but
a
worthwhile
offering
that
i
would
like
to
share
with
my
molson
drinking
father
o
not
great
by
samuel
smiths
standards
but
that
still
makes
for
a
solid
brew
nice
to
see
a
lager
thats
a
little
more
hopcentric
than
most
overall
i
am
going
to
vote
this
in
the
world
class
lager
realm
and
maybe
even
one
up
them
because
it
is
not
in
a
green
bottle
to
get
skunked
overall
generally
i
am
antiorganicmovement
products
but
with
this
beer
you
can
really
pick
up
on
the
clean
crisp
and
pure
flavours
a
very
nice
lager
indeed
my
only
concern
is
that
i
still
dont
think
a
lager
is
worth
this
sure
its
a
damn
quality
lager
but
it
is
still
au83
a
case
of
12
x
550ml
2013
ouch
o
a
superior
pale
beer
has
the
strengths
of
the
style
without
being
beerflavored
water
overall
i
recommend
this
poured
a
very
crystal
clear
pale
gold
promising
white
feathery
head
that
disappeared
in
seconds
1st
warning
aroma
was
mild
not
very
hoppy
at
all
2nd
warning
mouthfeel
was
mild
not
flat
not
overly
carbonated
just
average
and
that
pretty
much
explains
this
beer
average
in
every
sense
of
the
word
the
hops
were
almost
nonexistant
tasted
like
a
watered
down
miller
high
life
without
the
hops
and
malt
as
if
the
mhl
is
malty
in
any
way
considering
the
price
i
paid
for
this
experiment
4
or
5
for
the
bottle
maybe
i
forget
kind
of
like
how
this
beer
is
forgetable
id
take
the
miller
hands
down
every
time
its
not
that
this
sam
smith
brew
is
bad
in
any
way
there
is
nothing
obviously
wrong
with
it
it
just
doesnt
stand
out
at
all
or
do
anything
right
the
malt
is
light
as
expected
the
aroma
is
milder
than
expected
carbonation
was
right
on
not
high
or
low
more
hops
would
give
this
some
decent
flavor
something
it
is
lacking
it
is
drinkable
but
the
question
is
why
would
i
it
pours
a
very
light
clear
gold
with
a
white
head
that
dissapates
quickly
lacing
is
nice
once
the
head
dies
down
a
bit
very
grainy
on
the
nose
with
a
touch
of
hops
and
citrus
the
taste
shows
a
lot
of
grain
up
front
but
then
fades
into
a
malty
mildly
bitter
finish
the
carbonation
is
ferocious
but
it
gives
the
lighter
mouthfeel
some
character
i
love
that
is
is
organicbut
i
just
wish
that
there
was
some
more
body
behind
it
samuel
smiths
organic
lager
beer
45
o
a
real
good
euro
pale
lager
pilsener
overall
while
the
bitter
is
possibly
slightly
a
little
too
intense
for
a
lager
the
flavor
transitions
look
smell
and
feel
are
all
quite
nice
not
bad
pours
a
light
straw
color
with
a
solid
sheet
of
white
foam
brilliant
clarity
standard
grainy
slightly
fruity
nose
with
a
hint
of
corn
flavor
is
clean
and
subtle
with
straw
a
bit
of
soil
and
some
lemon
light
bodied
with
soft
carb
and
an
off
dry
finish
nice
beer
the
con
i
see
with
this
beer
is
the
acidic
aftertaste
it
takes
some
getting
used
to
but
overall
it
is
a
good
beer
o
its
a
pretty
decent
beer
dont
drink
pale
lagers
too
often
i
understand
why
some
may
be
disappointed
from
a
beer
like
this
coming
from
samuel
smith
their
oatmeal
stout
and
nut
brown
ale
are
impeccable
its
a
decent
beer
not
amazing
like
some
would
expect
from
samuel
smith
but
its
alright
little
lacking
on
flavor
in
my
opinion
but
wouldnt
hurt
for
anyone
to
try
props
for
being
organic
too
o
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
beer
its
cool
it
is
organic
but
first
beer
by
samuel
smith
that
disappointed
me
o
yeah
they
dont
make
any
crap
beers
at
sam
smiths
but
this
one
is
pretty
forgettable
o
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
and
definitely
tastes
organic
with
allmalt
flavors
rjt
pours
a
clear
honey
color
with
a
12
inch
foamy
white
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
foamy
patches
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
grain
and
some
grassy
and
hay
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
along
with
a
slight
fruity
flavor
there
is
a
mild
herbal
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
and
easy
drinking
beer
that
is
pretty
refreshing
o
quite
a
good
thirst
quencher
but
a
little
expensive
for
what
it
is
at
least
it
offers
enough
over
the
heinekens
of
the
world
to
make
it
worth
it
overall
this
is
a
very
good
lager
its
interesting
to
try
an
organic
beer
its
very
refreshing
and
would
be
great
on
a
summer
day
overall
a
full
flavored
and
aromaed
beer
for
the
genre
which
almost
diverts
from
the
genre
poured
in
a
glass
mug
pours
clear
straw
yellow
with
a
large
white
head
and
lots
of
tiny
bubbles
rising
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
the
head
dissipates
slowly
there
isnt
much
in
the
way
of
lacing
left
on
the
side
of
the
glass
the
beer
has
that
nice
crisp
clean
lager
smell
there
are
pale
malts
with
some
hops
in
the
aroma
there
are
flavors
of
cracker
and
some
hops
its
mildly
bready
the
body
is
light
with
abundant
carbonation
the
finish
is
crisp
and
dry
the
drinkability
is
high
overall
this
is
a
very
good
refreshing
beer
if
youre
looking
for
a
different
euro
lager
you
cant
go
wrong
with
this
one
a
solid
light
lager
not
something
i
have
said
a
ton
up
until
now
the
aroma
had
me
a
bit
worried
but
this
one
is
flavorful
and
balanced
o
lagers
arent
my
favorite
but
this
ones
clearly
above
average
im
not
sure
that
the
organic
ingredients
add
anything
but
marketing
flair
but
they
dont
hurt
either
all
in
all
a
very
refreshing
and
drinkable
option
and
better
than
most
american
lagers
especially
those
from
the
macrobrewers
o
quite
a
good
lager
ingredients
must
be
the
key
as
well
as
a
great
yeast
and
brewing
process
perfect
beer
for
a
hot
summer
day
and
pairs
well
with
almost
all
types
of
food
i
do
not
mean
to
insult
this
beer
in
any
way
but
this
is
the
perfect
lawnmower
beer
its
light
bodied
only
faintly
coats
the
tongue
and
well
carbonated
washes
down
really
nice
and
easy
would
be
a
great
refresher
on
a
hot
summer
day
overall
this
os
a
very
good
lager
clean
taste
and
well
balanced
now
i
am
thinking
that
id
like
to
pit
this
beer
against
noble
pils
in
the
spring
samuel
smith
vs
samuel
adams
i
could
easily
see
myself
preferring
this
beer
o
a
very
well
made
lager
certainly
better
than
the
large
majority
of
socalled
euro
lagers
i
do
like
this
and
the
aroma
is
very
nice
which
may
be
my
favorite
part
compared
to
a
german
pils
i
dont
like
it
as
well
but
it
seems
to
be
most
reminiscent
of
that
style
to
me
with
hop
and
malt
profile
i
believe
there
are
some
cheaper
alternatives
that
are
close
that
are
better
a
very
good
euro
pale
lagerperhaps
a
great
one
that
being
said
the
style
is
quite
limiting
and
simple
in
nature
o
this
is
a
very
unique
beer
and
although
its
a
bit
expensive
at
some
places
its
totally
worth
it
imo
the
grassy
nature
of
it
gives
it
such
a
natural
vibe
and
a
new
refreshing
taste
to
the
entire
concept
of
beer
good
stuff
550
ml
bottle
got
it
for
2
99
on
sale
at
my
local
giant
eagle
this
morning
served
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
clear
straw
gold
color
with
an
inch
white
head
head
retention
and
lacing
are
both
decent
enough
aroma
is
sweet
and
grainy
malt
along
with
some
lemon
peel
the
brew
tastes
like
grainy
malt
grassy
hops
and
a
bit
of
lemon
peel
mouthfeelbody
is
light
its
crisp
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
i
think
its
a
solid
beer
nothing
really
impresses
me
about
this
but
its
certainly
not
bad
at
all
overall
not
a
terribly
intriguing
beer
to
sample
but
still
goodtasting
nevertheless
o
the
best
of
the
style
ive
ever
had
its
obviously
doesnt
have
the
intense
flavors
of
a
ris
or
dipa
but
for
a
pale
lager
its
really
good
i
wouldnt
go
too
far
out
of
my
way
for
it
though
its
still
just
a
pale
euro
lager
one
of
the
more
expensive
lager
examples
but
its
a
solid
one
drink
fresh
these
have
a
tendency
to
get
all
yeasty
all
over
the
place
when
they
get
older
replete
with
chunkie
floaties
really
dont
see
where
the
as
coming
from
here
this
is
really
nothing
to
write
home
about
and
bears
striking
resemblance
to
an
american
adjunct
lager
organic
on
the
bottle
is
pretty
much
nothing
but
a
marketing
ploy
no
enhancement
of
taste
imo
finishgrains
and
a
bit
of
fresh
lemon
are
all
that
stay
dry
finish
but
refreshing
very
clean
overall
not
a
bad
beer
very
easy
to
drink
excellent
balance
even
though
the
flavor
is
light
theres
nothing
particularly
interesting
or
complex
about
this
beer
but
its
good
for
what
it
is
quite
useless
beer
for
a
euro
lager
this
is
pretty
solid
it
has
some
of
the
same
smells
as
the
macros
but
the
taste
is
cleaner
and
more
balanced
coming
close
to
a
pilsner
o
such
a
clean
refreshing
lager
a
constant
go
to
for
my
dad
and
me
both
the
appearance
was
a
cleanbubbly
wheat
colored
hue
and
the
smell
too
similar
no
skunk
or
bitter
odor
the
taste
expecting
to
be
full
of
hopswas
to
me
a
great
mixture
of
maltfullness
and
bodybut
also
a
kick
of
hops
and
honey
sweetness
ive
had
2
kinds
of
samuel
smiths
now
and
again
i
loved
this
beer
cant
wait
to
try
another
kind
and
see
if
they
hit
it
out
of
the
park
again
overall
very
solid
and
clean
english
lager
no
frills
here
but
certainly
sessionable
exceptional
for
the
style
i
will
get
this
again
if
not
just
for
the
clean
finish
the
flavor
is
excellent
and
i
can
see
why
this
beer
ranks
best
in
its
class
clean
and
refreshing
the
beer
is
light
simple
and
pleasant
toast
biscuits
bread
with
a
hint
of
citrus
terrific
balance
i
could
drink
several
of
these
thoroughly
enjoyable
i
wish
this
was
available
in
six
packs
i
will
certainly
be
having
this
one
again
o
i
burned
through
the
bottle
pretty
quick
just
an
excellent
brew
after
a
long
day
at
work
a
very
nice
lager
from
samuel
smith
has
the
intensity
of
a
good
pale
ale
but
the
light
lager
body
very
nice
beer
overall
a
great
drink
to
be
had
and
what
a
fantastic
summer
beer
this
is
on
a
hot
day
i
think
it
makes
me
appreciate
it
more
overall
its
a
delicate
but
pleasant
to
drink
beer
the
real
issue
is
price
for
a
fraction
i
could
drink
any
number
of
pale
lagers
that
are
just
as
good
if
not
better
overall
average
brew
from
one
of
my
favorite
traditional
english
breweries
o
pretty
decent
but
not
mindblowing
or
worth
spending
the
as
it
is
relatively
pricey
for
a
straightup
lager
o
good
for
its
style
but
overall
i
wouldnt
buy
it
again
from
the
samuel
smith
beers
that
i
have
tried
this
one
was
my
least
favorite
but
not
bad
by
any
sort
of
measure
overall
a
great
beer
that
will
make
you
want
to
keep
a
few
on
hand
just
in
case
my
pour
netted
me
a
big
foamy
cap
of
a
dense
finger
of
bonewhite
head
with
very
good
retention
color
was
a
light
goldenyellow
with
nequality
clarity
nose
had
the
characteristic
lagermalt
sweetness
with
grassy
undertones
fantastiche
especially
after
all
of
those
aals
mouthfeel
was
soft
not
overly
carbonated
but
i
am
unsure
of
their
claim
about
it
being
a
hoppier
lager
instead
i
got
a
good
bit
of
clean
lager
sweetness
and
by
clean
i
mean
adjunct
free
if
you
really
want
to
understand
the
impact
adjuncts
have
on
lager
beers
have
and
afternoon
of
aals
followed
the
next
day
by
one
of
these
finish
was
dry
and
refreshing
just
the
way
lager
should
be
organic
usually
more
expensive
but
this
bottle
was
the
same
price
as
the
other
beers
from
sam
smiths
and
it
was
very
pleasant
to
drink
i
would
have
it
again
comments
all
people
who
hate
cheap
beer
should
drink
this
to
see
what
it
is
modeled
off
of
there
arent
many
lagers
this
good
this
really
grew
on
me
as
it
opened
up
the
butterscotchy
buttery
biscuit
flavors
were
wonderfully
executed
and
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
the
lagers
ive
had
recently
o
this
is
on
par
with
heineken
and
the
like
its
not
something
i
care
to
drink
again
this
lager
pours
out
much
like
any
other
lager
the
color
is
clear
and
yellow
with
a
white
soapy
looking
head
the
aroma
of
this
beer
is
a
little
grassy
with
some
fresh
wood
coming
through
along
with
the
malts
and
hops
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
lightly
grassy
and
has
a
good
amount
of
malt
upfront
this
fades
into
the
slightly
hoppy
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
mostly
on
the
lighter
side
for
a
lager
not
too
bad
of
a
beer
overall
a
solid
lager
that
i
would
definitely
seek
out
again
i
usually
like
hoppier
lagerspilsners
but
this
one
is
a
sessionable
refreshing
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
what
takes
this
from
a
typical
lager
to
something
i
would
choose
to
drink
again
despite
my
preference
for
ales
light
and
smooth
but
with
just
enough
body
and
dryness
in
the
finish
to
make
this
a
crisp
and
enjoyably
drinkable
beer
a
well
refined
simple
lager
much
better
than
your
average
beer
of
this
style
thumbs
up
i
am
not
sure
how
old
this
bottle
is
but
this
lager
does
taste
fresh
lagers
usually
dont
come
to
mind
when
you
think
of
britain
but
this
is
a
solid
effort
while
this
four
pack
was
quite
expensive
it
is
worth
seeking
out
telegraph
road
is
a
song
by
dire
straits
organically
this
is
a
brew
that
should
be
the
coconut
falling
off
the
tree
that
hits
you
in
the
head
lets
give
it
a
whirl
popping
the
top
i
get
the
immediate
farm
smell
like
i
am
feeding
hay
to
cows
the
smell
then
accelerates
to
a
golden
grain
meadow
but
quickly
goes
white
grape
the
pour
is
nicely
golden
with
an
off
white
mutli
bubble
head
that
laces
nicely
the
taste
is
all
grape
as
the
smell
might
preclude
this
is
a
sweet
lager
with
minimum
hopping
that
would
pair
well
with
seafood
and
light
fare
not
my
cup
of
tea
but
rated
for
what
it
is
not
bad
and
refreshing
i
think
the
chunnel
was
a
bad
idea
this
beer
shows
you
why
pours
a
very
very
transparent
golden
color
bordering
on
a
bright
apricot
a
prettyhard
pour
produces
a
singlefinger
head
that
reduces
to
half
its
size
somewhat
quickly
though
leaves
a
pretty
good
bit
of
lacing
behind
good
looking
collar
sits
around
the
edges
the
nose
brings
forward
a
bit
of
grain
and
a
slight
fruitiness
some
english
yeast
present
not
much
but
its
there
slight
earthy
feel
to
it
as
well
taste
has
a
nice
bit
of
hoppines
and
a
smooth
crisp
bit
of
grain
finish
is
really
smooth
and
crisp
great
character
in
the
finish
quite
drinkable
and
enjoyable
the
mouthfeel
is
great
its
highly
carbonated
and
slips
right
down
my
throat
the
drinkability
is
also
awesome
i
could
drink
this
all
night
i
just
have
a
single
bottle
though
a
great
beer
that
makes
all
the
other
euro
pale
lagers
ive
had
seem
like
a
bad
joke
highly
recommended
that
being
said
pair
it
with
the
light
yet
flavorful
foods
that
you
want
to
eat
on
those
nice
days
fried
fish
tacos
a
niçoise
salad
deviled
eggs
sushi
a
lemony
pasta
dish
crab
cakes
etc
as
for
cheese
set
up
a
cheese
plate
with
a
good
garlicky
salami
some
olives
nuts
and
an
assortment
of
cheeses
to
try
with
this
beer
some
mellow
middleofthe
road
cow
cheeses
such
as
pleasent
ridge
reserve
or
montgomerys
farm
cheddar
will
pair
well
with
the
delicacy
and
acidity
of
this
beer
a
fresh
local
goat
milk
cheese
such
as
snowdrop
from
haystack
or
cabra
blanca
from
avalanche
goat
dairy
will
be
a
nice
compliment
as
well
feel
free
to
play
around
a
bit
though
this
beer
offers
an
interesting
complex
texture
and
flavor
profile
that
offers
a
great
deal
of
cheese
pairing
potential
poured
from
a
brown
18
7
oz
bottle
has
a
light
golden
color
with
a
1
inch
head
smell
is
of
mild
malts
some
sweetness
taste
is
crisp
malts
and
hops
very
refreshing
and
solid
flavor
feels
full
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
has
good
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
quality
beer
light
straw
old
with
a
large
white
fluffy
head
clear
liquid
with
good
retention
and
lacing
smell
is
light
sweet
malt
breadiness
with
a
twang
that
is
typical
of
an
organic
ale
nice
light
herbal
hops
taste
is
just
grand
and
proper
smooth
malt
and
grains
with
a
touch
of
funk
and
earth
a
hint
of
doughy
sweetness
dry
clean
finish
features
excellent
hops
with
some
bread
crusts
and
crackers
feel
is
light
crisp
and
quenching
a
gentle
carbonation
aids
feel
and
drinkability
which
is
superb
i
went
through
my
500
ml
bottle
in
a
flash
this
has
taste
profile
that
goes
with
so
many
things
that
i
could
spend
a
month
drinking
and
combining
foods
yum
cheers
drinkability
good
drinkabllity
i
could
see
myself
having
another
one
very
easily
went
very
well
with
pizza
and
i
think
it
would
go
well
with
a
lot
of
other
meals
overall
a
very
solidly
good
beer
d
good
overall
refreshing
and
very
drinkable
not
outstanding
but
how
much
can
you
really
do
with
this
style
it
has
the
qualities
of
most
pale
lagers
but
id
say
the
hop
flavor
shines
through
making
this
one
unique
from
the
rest
more
flavorful
than
others
and
quite
refreshing
a
good
beer
that
id
definitely
buy
again
yeah
could
really
take
or
leave
this
beer
d
not
a
half
bad
lager
and
for
the
style
this
is
pretty
good
i
like
the
idea
of
an
organic
beer
and
luckily
this
one
isnt
as
bad
as
some
of
the
other
ones
on
the
market
worth
a
try
if
youre
in
the
mood
jake
d
while
this
isnt
the
most
exciting
beer
out
there
its
a
good
tasting
easy
drinking
beer
worth
picking
up
sometime
hey
im
a
big
fan
of
samuel
smiths
beers
i
just
didnt
find
anything
special
about
this
one
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
light
bodied
and
creamy
with
a
touch
of
a
crisp
edge
the
beer
goes
down
way
too
easy
a
wonderful
session
lager
overall
this
was
a
nice
way
to
end
our
tasting
cheers
to
samuel
safe
travels
friend
we
look
forward
to
seeing
you
in
tadcaster
sometime
soon
m
high
carbonation
and
a
lightmedium
feel
cleancrisp
dvery
easy
drinking
just
not
anything
to
get
real
excited
about
which
has
more
to
do
with
the
style
than
this
particular
beer
one
of
the
better
organic
beers
ive
had
extremely
high
probably
the
best
euro
lager
ive
drank
so
far
a
perfect
session
beer
d
this
one
could
easily
break
someone
of
a
bud
addiction
it
has
all
the
seemingly
positive
hallmarks
of
your
average
high
profile
adjunct
beer
light
simple
taste
familiarity
drinkability
etc
and
and
then
some
great
for
a
summer
day
like
today
drinkability
although
the
flavor
is
pretty
mild
here
it
is
very
smooth
and
goes
down
pretty
easy
not
something
i
would
crave
but
would
definitely
do
if
options
were
limited
a
great
brew
that
im
worried
may
have
been
too
old
in
comparison
to
the
original
non
organic
lager
this
was
not
as
brisk
didnt
really
contain
any
bitter
palate
cleanser
just
a
mild
sweet
of
apple
pie
golden
in
color
with
some
lace
the
malt
had
a
mild
caramel
that
i
didnt
come
across
before
good
summer
brew
none
the
less
a
session
starter
drink
this
not
american
lager
they
yeast
is
more
interesting
this
a
great
tasting
brew
the
smell
and
flavor
profile
was
something
ive
never
experienced
before
different
but
good
it
just
feels
like
a
lot
of
love
went
into
making
this
beer
pours
a
clear
gold
with
a
small
white
head
fine
stream
of
carbonation
race
upward
for
several
minutes
it
smells
and
tastes
far
better
than
other
euro
pale
lagers
in
that
completely
lacks
that
chemicallymetallic
quality
that
ruins
so
many
of
its
competitors
its
flavors
are
simple
but
well
balanced
and
without
blemish
in
my
opinion
this
is
perhaps
the
best
pale
lager
in
the
world
overall
a
nice
little
beer
worth
trying
if
you
havent
and
worth
grabbing
a
couple
bottles
to
keep
around
for
summer
sipping
gold
and
crystal
clear
with
a
bright
white
cap
lots
of
sticky
lace
good
head
retention
balanced
aroma
of
cereal
grains
doughy
malt
pears
herbal
hops
nicely
balanced
flavour
too
moderate
bitterness
with
an
herbal
edge
sweet
malts
with
a
hint
of
caramel
grassy
hops
with
a
bit
of
spice
and
lemon
in
the
finish
medium
bodied
with
ample
carbonation
light
dryness
and
a
crisp
character
good
stuff
highly
drinkable
and
quite
tasty
drinkability
quite
drinkable
and
refreshing
if
there
were
a
little
more
complexity
then
perhaps
my
interest
would
remain
piqued
long
enough
to
rate
this
even
higher
still
i
would
gladly
have
this
again
i
find
it
considerably
better
than
the
ss
pure
brewed
lager
beer
overall
i
like
this
beer
it
is
a
good
solid
lager
but
i
must
admit
i
am
a
bit
biased
when
i
reach
for
a
beer
unless
i
really
in
the
mood
i
dont
normally
reach
for
a
lager
that
being
said
it
is
a
pretty
damn
good
lager
overall
this
was
a
nice
and
understated
beer
nothing
spectacular
but
no
flaws
worth
a
shot
overall
a
pretty
uncomplicated
straight
forward
lager
easy
to
drink
and
refreshing
definitely
a
cut
above
standard
lagers
something
you
might
want
to
share
with
a
bmc
drinking
friend
that
you
are
trying
to
convert
d
a
fantastic
sessionable
lager
poured
a
deep
yellow
with
a
light
head
that
dissipated
fairly
quickly
very
little
lacings
sticking
to
the
edge
of
the
glass
nice
clarity
sweet
malty
aroma
with
wisp
of
hoppiness
lightly
carbonated
initial
heavy
malt
feel
with
a
surprisingly
light
finish
nice
malty
lager
flavor
with
a
pleasant
light
hop
finish
not
a
whole
lot
of
character
but
very
drinkable
could
definitey
put
a
few
of
these
away
at
one
sitting
super
easy
drinking
beer
with
some
flavor
to
enjoy
without
needing
to
pause
to
contemplate
anything
about
it
kudos
to
sam
smiths
for
being
organic
and
pulling
off
an
english
lager
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
this
would
be
ultimate
goto
for
football
parties
if
money
was
not
a
concern
cheers
libation
very
drinkable
and
the
5
abv
means
you
can
have
a
few
without
flinching
not
the
most
flavorful
lager
on
the
planet
but
i
think
is
has
enough
complexity
for
the
style
probably
a
very
good
beer
to
wean
people
away
from
generic
macro
brews
d
sams
organic
ale
beats
out
the
lager
in
my
opinion
but
they
are
two
different
genres
of
music
theres
really
nothing
spectacular
about
this
beer
and
i
could
have
expected
more
from
my
favorite
english
brewery
not
bad
by
any
means
and
really
quite
tasty
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
taste
but
easily
drinkable
still
for
something
of
this
nature
its
nothing
more
than
ordinary
even
if
it
is
all
organic
d
very
much
so
and
i
can
see
why
this
one
of
europes
most
popular
lagers
if
american
macro
lager
tasted
like
this
none
of
us
would
rip
on
it
sam
smith
lager
has
more
body
and
flavor
than
massproduced
lagers
but
it
still
delivers
the
crisp
refreshment
that
makes
a
good
lager
such
a
turn
on
drinkability
very
easy
to
drink
this
lager
and
the
flavor
profile
hits
the
spot
skål
d
you
cant
get
any
more
drinkable
than
this
perfect
balance
of
malt
and
hops
clean
dry
well
attenuated
and
just
plain
good
d
refreshing
and
easy
drinking
drinkability
is
high
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
finishes
cleanly
there
is
some
mild
sweetness
at
the
front
of
the
mouth
and
overall
its
a
fine
beer
not
much
to
say
but
i
did
enjoy
it
and
would
drink
it
again
d
great
lager
very
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
it
has
lived
up
to
my
expectations
in
fact
it
is
my
new
favorite
and
i
cant
wait
to
get
more
it
is
very
flavorful
and
so
easy
to
drink
while
im
sure
that
i
dont
know
what
actual
contributions
are
made
by
the
organic
properties
of
this
beer
overall
this
is
a
clean
and
refreshing
lager
a
simple
concept
but
not
always
easy
in
its
rendering
and
this
purveyor
of
fine
english
standard
ales
shows
that
to
be
the
case
here
notes
i
have
to
admit
i
was
a
little
skeptical
of
a
pale
organic
lager
i
should
have
known
better
apparently
samuel
smith
can
do
no
wrong
550
ml
bottle
into
my
samuel
smiths
glass
pours
a
transparent
golden
with
a
decent
head
that
lasts
much
longer
than
expected
smells
of
fresh
malted
barley
and
hops
taste
is
smooth
grain
malted
barley
i
was
expecting
this
to
taste
much
more
like
that
offensive
barley
you
get
from
miller
lite
but
none
of
that
here
maybe
because
the
ingredients
are
organically
grown
withou
the
use
of
chemical
sprays
or
artificial
fertilizers
which
is
nice
if
youre
into
that
kind
of
thing
mouthfeel
is
smooth
with
medium
carbonation
very
drinkable
this
would
be
a
great
session
beer
of
what
i
would
characterize
as
this
style
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
better
beers
i
have
had
cheers
salud
drinkability
a
decent
lager
exceedingly
drinkable
with
much
more
flavors
than
your
standard
pale
lagers
worth
a
try
another
plus
is
that
this
is
an
organic
product
and
the
hippy
in
me
just
loves
that
for
british
style
lager
this
is
right
up
there
at
the
top
heck
its
organic
like
in
the
old
days
very
drinkable
i
need
some
pub
food
organic
or
not
body
is
a
little
thin
but
very
refreshing
beer
that
is
remarkably
easy
to
drink
d
fairly
drinkable
and
refreshing
just
not
a
big
fan
of
the
cidery
sweetness
lacks
punch
a
very
decent
lager
very
smooth
and
cleansing
the
carbonation
is
slightly
too
extreme
but
otherwise
i
found
it
perfectly
drinkable
and
enjoyable
nice
notes
next
up
is
the
non
organic
sam
smith
lager
so
that
i
can
see
if
there
is
any
appreciable
difference
lager
is
not
my
favorite
style
but
this
is
a
nice
flavorful
one
big
frothy
white
head
and
a
slightly
orange
golden
body
completely
clear
body
as
well
slightly
citrusy
nose
with
a
weaker
malt
body
for
a
euro
pale
lager
this
nose
is
pretty
good
nice
bit
of
hops
the
taste
is
better
than
average
for
the
style
and
extremely
drinkable
good
thicker
than
usual
feel
simply
put
this
is
an
amazing
combination
of
drinkability
and
unique
tastiness
its
got
all
the
refreshing
qualities
of
a
good
lager
with
a
whole
bunch
more
the
aftertaste
has
a
delicious
creaminess
that
lingers
on
the
palate
and
tickles
my
tongue
every
sip
makes
me
want
more
i
have
to
say
i
have
never
tasted
a
lager
this
good
even
though
it
traveled
here
all
the
way
from
england
it
tastes
as
fresh
as
the
day
it
was
bottled
at
around
10
for
a
four
pack
its
a
bit
pricey
but
i
find
myself
looking
forward
to
the
next
time
i
can
buy
it
nontheless
d
easy
to
drink
because
theres
not
much
to
it
just
dont
want
to
drink
many
of
these
but
samuel
smith
has
never
really
done
me
wrong
d
one
of
the
better
epls
the
lightness
makes
it
an
easy
drinker
not
the
most
complex
beer
in
the
world
but
a
decent
pickup
overall
pale
lagers
arent
my
favorite
kind
of
beers
but
this
was
a
well
executed
example
of
the
style
overall
i
like
this
beer
it
is
a
well
crafted
high
quality
lager
i
could
have
stronger
grain
and
malt
in
the
flavor
but
that
is
a
personal
preference
if
you
like
lagers
try
this
beer
pretty
much
everything
sam
smith
brews
is
money
and
this
is
no
exception
even
the
simplest
of
styles
comes
out
beautiful
could
drink
buckets
of
this
stuff
overall
a
fine
a
very
drinkable
lager
a
tasty
summer
slammer
lawnmower
beverage
that
also
has
some
style
a
good
beer
drinakbilty
not
as
carbonated
a
the
pure
brewed
lager
by
samuel
smith
but
still
quite
active
good
lager
better
than
99
of
lagers
on
the
market
this
was
consumed
in
front
of
the
grill
on
a
real
hot
day
and
it
hit
the
spot
clean
crisp
flavors
no
off
aftertaste
solid
beer
id
buy
again
drinkability
euro
pale
laggers
are
usual
a
hateful
thing
even
when
they
are
good
they
are
just
ok
this
brings
flavor
to
the
world
of
euro
pale
lagers
at
the
price
though
there
are
much
better
beers
to
have
in
both
the
lager
and
ale
kingdoms
respectively
a
good
take
on
a
rather
boring
style
i
would
reccomend
trying
this
one
out
its
not
bad
but
im
a
alestout
guy
so
its
not
my
fancy
but
good
for
what
it
is
a
very
pleasant
and
well
done
lager
but
those
who
think
that
it
is
the
worlds
best
one
in
the
world
they
have
probably
not
been
in
germany
drinkability
even
on
a
hot
summers
day
id
rather
have
something
with
either
more
body
or
more
carbonation
and
refreshingness
this
has
neither
a
nice
easy
to
drink
lager
tastes
clean
and
flavorful
however
theres
nothing
special
that
sets
it
apart
from
the
pack
a
good
one
and
worth
a
try
but
not
an
award
winner
mild
carbonation
and
a
smooth
body
make
this
a
nice
session
lager
this
beer
has
enough
up
front
but
the
finish
is
where
its
at
a
touch
light
on
the
finish
but
very
smooth
quite
refreshing
and
carbonation
is
just
enough
to
cover
the
beer
through
the
finish
oaty
fruity
malty
finish
that
is
just
delicate
enough
to
melt
away
in
your
mouth
jordan
drinkability
is
huge
this
is
a
wicked
refreshing
lager
easily
among
my
favorite
lagers
and
something
im
probably
going
to
buy
a
lot
of
this
summer
its
not
a
flavor
explosion
but
a
crisp
refreshing
beer
poured
a
golden
yellow
in
my
tulip
glass
with
a
fluffy
white
head
i
have
a
weak
nose
but
really
not
picking
up
anything
in
the
aroma
department
the
flavor
was
a
crisp
malt
and
subtle
yet
spicy
and
with
a
little
citrus
and
floral
hop
bitterness
right
level
of
carbonation
and
a
really
enjoyable
refreshing
beer
impressed
that
an
organic
which
can
have
all
sorts
of
off
tastes
can
be
so
fresh
and
clean
definitely
a
good
beer
i
look
forward
to
having
this
again
sometime
down
the
road
drinkability
i
love
how
this
beer
uses
organic
hops
and
barley
to
make
this
one
up
reminds
me
alot
of
having
a
glass
of
cianti
the
grape
like
aromas
and
taste
make
this
one
a
good
subsitute
to
your
traditional
wine
pairings
goes
well
with
pasta
and
heavier
meals
overall
i
enjoyed
the
flavorings
and
thought
this
one
hit
the
mark
an
excellent
beer
that
makes
you
think
about
how
much
beer
can
take
wine
on
head
to
head
pours
a
very
clear
honeyyellow
colored
body
with
an
average
white
head
but
diminishing
some
maltiness
spice
fresh
like
hay
or
grass
not
much
aroma
laggerish
taste
that
same
fresh
plant
smell
clean
aftertaste
amost
watery
i
could
certainly
have
a
session
of
these
but
only
if
somebody
else
was
paying
for
my
own
hard
earned
i
want
a
lot
more
d
stays
true
to
its
style
though
its
definitely
on
the
bottom
of
the
list
for
me
i
might
have
one
this
summer
as
its
easy
to
drink
but
i
cant
say
id
reach
for
this
over
a
wheat
beer
on
a
hot
summer
day
probably
my
favorite
lager
ive
tried
and
id
expect
no
less
from
samuel
smith
excellent
with
pizza
drinkability
very
pleasant
low
alcohol
makes
it
easy
to
have
a
few
pours
clear
straw
color
with
active
carbonation
demonstrated
by
swirling
bubbles
to
a
thick
foamy
white
head
that
leaves
a
web
of
lace
this
is
a
great
looking
beer
good
malt
aroma
with
light
malt
and
hay
nice
clean
taste
that
is
light
and
malty
on
the
initial
followed
by
a
pleasantly
lingering
lightly
bitter
aftertaste
that
has
a
mild
tobacco
overtone
really
nice
mouthfeel
is
lightbodied
with
an
active
carbonation
that
is
just
right
not
overly
so
this
is
very
drinkable
goes
great
with
indian
food
pretzels
or
just
about
anything
that
calls
for
a
mild
beer
this
makes
a
fine
one
for
a
session
as
well
nicely
done
this
is
for
sure
a
carefully
crafted
beer
theyve
struck
a
wonderful
balance
for
a
beer
so
crisp
and
clean
extremely
drinkable
mediumlight
flavor
profile
but
pretty
tasty
i
probably
wouldnt
pay
what
they
tend
to
charge
for
this
beer
in
4
packs
but
i
cant
deny
that
it
is
a
very
good
drinkable
lager
drinkability
nice
lager
even
nicer
considering
its
organic
sammy
does
it
again
d
light
and
refreshing
lager
with
a
crisp
clean
character
and
a
nice
floral
hop
profile
certainly
easy
to
drink
though
i
dont
think
id
have
more
than
a
couple
pints
overall
really
well
done
and
the
fact
that
its
organic
is
just
an
added
bonus
soft
drinkable
beer
i
would
buy
this
again
d
simple
and
tangy
all
around
good
example
of
a
lager
very
bright
straw
color
with
decent
lacing
the
aroma
is
subtle
but
lets
you
know
its
a
pale
lager
with
a
bit
of
grass
the
flavor
is
snappy
but
not
sharp
like
a
pilsner
mildly
sweet
but
very
clean
the
taste
isnt
vastly
superior
to
an
average
lager
but
you
can
taste
that
this
is
a
quality
beer
its
crisp
which
blends
in
with
an
ample
carbonation
making
for
a
bright
effervescent
but
not
overly
bubbly
mouthfeel
not
something
i
would
buy
this
was
a
gift
but
nice
to
experience
sam
smiths
take
on
a
pale
lager
very
light
color
a
thin
strawyellow
appearance
is
saved
by
a
nice
frothy
head
reminiscent
of
cappuccino
a
nice
enough
smell
with
mild
citrus
and
sweet
nilla
wafer
hmmmm
surprisingly
thin
flavor
yet
oddly
what
is
there
is
extremely
well
balanced
sweet
up
front
but
a
nice
hoppy
finish
that
helps
keep
the
palate
clean
and
refreshed
there
just
isnt
enough
of
the
flavor
coming
through
could
definitely
drink
these
easily
especially
on
a
hot
day
but
there
are
so
many
less
expensive
options
that
will
deliver
more
flavor
just
as
nicely
style
wise
this
beer
is
tops
have
never
been
happier
to
drink
a
beer
labled
euro
pale
lager
in
my
life
as
a
session
it
is
hard
to
beat
light
crisp
refreshing
and
complex
without
being
pretentious
fantastic
beer
should
be
the
benchmark
for
all
other
beers
of
this
style
drinking
a
beer
like
this
makes
me
wonder
whyhow
macro
beer
became
what
it
is
today
i
suppose
capitalism
had
something
to
do
with
it
when
companies
realized
they
could
make
tons
of
money
even
after
cutting
back
on
more
expensive
ingredients
that
being
said
though
i
am
willing
to
bet
my
paycheck
that
if
you
gave
this
beer
to
a
stone
cole
bmc
drinking
in
a
blind
taste
test
with
the
bmc
product
of
thier
choice
they
would
choose
this
beer
every
time
and
then
immediatly
after
realizing
this
they
would
commit
suppoku
for
the
unbearable
amount
of
shame
such
a
realization
brings
and
spill
their
entrails
right
on
the
floor
of
the
tasting
room
that
is
how
good
this
beer
this
overall
one
of
the
best
lagers
ive
had
being
usually
not
a
fan
of
beers
that
taste
like
macrolagers
rated
aug

2008
ive
tended
to
find
grassyoff
flavors
in
organic
brews
this
beer
lacks
any
of
that
a
boring
style
for
me
but
they
nailed
it
kind
of
satisfying
in
a
simple
kind
of
way
also
has
a
nice
crisp
finish
but
lacks
any
grainy
or
metallic
bite
to
it
that
ruins
so
many
lagers
taste
mouthfeel
dry
crackery
malt
flavors
appear
up
front
again
very
clean
and
crisp
slight
sweetness
appears
midpalate
light
bodied
very
light
frutiness
toward
the
finish
with
a
mild
dry
aftertaste
thats
faintly
metallic
and
grainy
a
damn
fine
lager
somewhat
rough
but
in
a
good
way
d
this
is
a
refreshing
session
beer
no
doubt
pretty
delightful
d
on
the
whole
this
beer
wasnt
bad
its
about
as
good
as
a
lagers
going
to
get
its
not
the
first
beer
style
id
choose
the
taste
is
very
nice
full
bodied
with
good
light
complexity
it
has
bread
and
grain
with
a
flowery
herballemon
bitterness
and
some
apple
great
bittersweet
balance
with
strong
malt
taste
transitioning
into
a
pleasantly
bitter
hoppy
finish
refreshing
and
tasty
its
very
smooth
and
drinkable
a
sessionable
lager
and
certainly
respectable
enough
might
serve
as
a
good
crossover
brew
and
would
make
a
for
a
great
fit
on
a
summers
day
i
should
have
enjoyed
this
one
months
ago
moderate
and
unoriginal
but
it
is
organic
i
guess
light
hops
not
a
bitter
beer
crisp
clean
mild
and
wellrounded
refreshing
easy
drinking
it
is
a
plain
vanilla
beer
beer
pours
a
pale
straw
with
minimal
head
the
smell
is
of
a
light
lager
not
very
impressive
the
taste
is
very
complex
sweet
and
light
malt
with
a
back
end
of
hops
it
leaves
a
nice
feeling
on
the
tongue
i
could
drink
this
all
day
and
night
a
beautiful
beer
beer
leaves
moderate
lacing
in
the
glass
i
strongly
recommend
it
best
example
of
its
style
ive
ever
had
i
havent
come
across
a
bad
one
yet
deac
solid
lager
that
doesnt
fill
you
up
not
much
on
first
impressions
but
well
done
slim
12
ounce
bottle
wo
freshness
info
pours
quite
light
golden
amber
and
very
clear
soft
white
head
retentive
at
the
18
of
an
inch
level
and
leaving
scattered
lace
upon
a
more
then
gentle
swirl
the
nose
i
pick
up
is
of
some
grass
and
lemonyfloral
mild

pleasant
and
easy
drinking
for
the
style
its
got
generous
hope
bite
up
front
riding
over
an
undercoating
of
soft
and
friendly
malts
better
then
average
interest
here
nice
beer
to
try
out
on
your
unfortunate
macro
swilling
amigos
bring
on
the
spicy
foods
as
this
one
has
the
crispness
and
bite
to
cut
through
the
heat
and
fat
worthy
offering
dare
i
say
one
of
my
favorite
euro
pale
lagers
this
was
a
very
good
but
not
the
absolute
best
lager
that
i
have
ever
had
nice
head
that
fairly
quickly
reduced
but
the
crown
marked
all
the
way
down
to
the
finish
good
and
fresh
smell
and
mouthfeel
was
well
above
average
this
will
be
a
lager
that
i
will
probably
keep
around
but
not
a
staple
very
good
drinkability
drinkability
subtle
complex
low
abv
high
drinkability
a
really
tasty
lager
one
of
the
best
ive
had
samuel
smith
never
disappoints
probably
one
of
the
best
organic
brews
i
have
ever
had
it
has
a
great
balance
of
clean
malts
and
hops
very
refreshing
and
solid
beer
im
not
typically
a
huge
lager
fan
but
i
did
enjoy
this
one
golden
color
and
pours
a
fairy
nice
thick
white
head
id
say
it
lasts
halfway
through
the
beer
then
its
gone
mild
sweet
grassy
aroma
with
malty
notes
very
smooth
tasting
fruity
notes
grassy
and
a
touch
of
hops
mixed
in
solid
lager
bought
in
to
complete
the
samuel
smith
line
up
a
prettty
decent
lager
a
good
bitterness
level
low
lacing
a
good
organic
that
dosnt
remind
me
of
hippies
not
much
else
to
this
beer
to
sum
it
up
a
simple
non
offensive
organicfad
lager
from
tadcaster
5
first
thing
i
noticed
was
the
generous
head
this
beer
produced
when
poured
that
showed
great
retention
and
some
lacing
classic
orangegold
color
as
a
lager
should
have
appealing
citrusy
aroma
of
hops
a
little
light
in
the
mouth
but
exceptionally
easy
to
drink
balanced
flavors
of
barley
hops
and
dry
malts
a
good
session
brew
a
great
addition
to
the
organic
market
d
nothing
wrong
with
the
beer
but
not
something
id
worry
about
getting
again
the
organic
factor
is
good
but
there
is
plenty
of
local
made
beers
that
id
rather
drink
d
this
is
a
great
tasting
euro
pale
lager
i
was
really
impressed
with
the
sweet
malty
flavor
drinkability
a
very
competent
lager
from
samuel
smith
the
fact
that
this
is
an
organically
produced
beer
isnt
much
of
a
selling
point
for
me
but
its
definitely
a
worthwhile
lager
nice
lemony
color
and
a
thin
lacy
head
lots
of
bubbles
in
the
glass
and
in
the
mouth
and
a
fruity
aroma
and
hoppy
taste
that
go
down
easy
on
a
summer
day
or
any
day
for
that
matter
a
pleasant
break
from
ales
i
wish
this
came
in
a
six
pack
settled
as
a
medium
color
gold
with
thin
lacing
and
a
thin
head
aromas
are
delicate
wheat
bread
and
hops
taste
has
a
great
clean
punch
with
a
slight
bittersweet
hint
mouthfeel
was
superior
incredibly
crisp
refreshing
light
and
well
balanced
to
keep
flavor
tight
overall
a
great
lager
the
only
downside
is
the
price
i
paid
10
for
a
4pack
2
50bottle
in
new
york
city
ouch
d
high
very
high
pours
a
pale
gold
with
a
tight
white
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
bit
the
nose
is
fairly
rich
for
a
pale
lager
with
a
nice
breadiness
some
grassy
hop
aromas
and
a
touch
of
light
lemonyherbal
citrus
pretty
light
on
the
palate
the
bready
flavors
have
faded
a
bit
but
there
is
still
a
nice
clean
graininess
coupled
with
very
light
herbal
and
earthy
hops
not
as
much
lager
yeast
tanginess
as
is
often
found
which
gives
the
grain
and
the
clean
flavors
of
this
lightly
hopped
beer
to
shine
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
ive
converted
a
number
of
macro
ddrinkers
with
this
the
organic
hook
seems
to
work
with
a
number
of
people
as
some
others
have
commented
this
is
the
real
deal
though
it
is
organic
which
is
laudable
but
more
importantly
it
is
a
fine
tasting
beer
kudos
soft
carbonation
speaks
to
a
british
touch
and
really
allows
me
to
focus
on
flavor
an
easy
choice
for
a
session
beer
im
always
wary
of
things
labeled
organic
as
they
can
be
focused
more
on
marketing
than
quality
here
however
sam
smiths
delivers
smooth
and
clean
wellcarbonated
and
refreshing
excellent
drinkability
overall
leagues
ahead
of
most
other
euro
pale
lagers
and
macro
style
beers
ive
had
the
organic
thing
is
great
and
i
think
this
could
serve
as
a
good
gateway
beer
as
for
me
im
glad
i
tried
it
and
might
suggest
it
to
some
friends
that
dont
know
a
lot
about
beer
but
i
doubt
ill
be
picking
it
up
again
myself
any
time
soon
who
knew
the
british
could
make
a
quality
pale
lager
this
is
not
your
average
pale
lager
the
beer
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
thin
white
lace
head
the
aroma
is
decent
it
boasts
primarily
of
pale
malts
and
lager
yeast
with
a
mild
hop
scent
the
taste
is
good
it
is
clean
and
refreshing
it
has
largely
a
pale
malt
flavor
with
a
light
hop
taste
it
is
light
and
highly
drinkable
this
is
a
low
bodied
beer
with
decent
carbonation
this
is
the
best
lager
you
will
have
this
is
easily
one
of
he
best
organic
brews
ive
had
and
a
very
unique
lager
drinkability
is
very
good
a
great
euro
pale
lager
probably
cost
prohibitive
to
drink
by
the
case
but
it
would
sure
beat
heineken
or
something
if
you
wanted
to
switch
it
up
for
your
non
beer
geek
friends
the
downfall
in
my
opinion
was
drinkability
it
begins
taking
on
an
acidic
feel
and
the
leafy
almost
grassy
flavors
dont
sit
well
mouthfeel
is
light
and
smooth
everything
about
this
beer
screams
drinkable
but
the
flavor
isnt
there
for
me
verdict
nice
example
of
an
organic
lager
smooth
and
drinkable
like
a
lager
should
be
d
this
one
is
really
easy
to
drink
im
looking
forward
trying
other
organically
produced
beers
the
beer
was
light
bodied
and
crisp
with
nice
carbonation
throughout
i
would
fit
this
into
the
session
category
with
the
second
one
tasting
just
as
good
as
the
first
a
good
solid
nofrills
brew
that
flirts
with
the
notion
of
being
a
paradigm
beer
and
its
organic
for
what
thats
worth
good
show
poured
from
a
550ml
bottle
into
a
samuel
smiths
imperial
pint
glass
crystal
clear
golden
color
with
a
medium
head
that
dissipated
quickly
and
left
hardly
any
lacing
smelled
like
a
standard
lager
hops
with
a
bit
of
citrus
tasted
extremely
crisp
on
the
palate
fairly
dry
and
light
bodied
nice
hop
flavor
a
bit
of
sweet
malt
on
the
tip
of
the
tongue
finishing
nicely
with
a
bitter
aftertaste
really
crisp
clean
brew
pours
a
golden
orange
color
with
a
watery
white
head
not
much
lacing
on
the
pint
glass
aroma
is
pretty
standard
lager
with
clean
grainy
flavors
a
hint
of
citrus
and
a
smooth
sweetness
flavor
is
much
the
same
the
graininess
is
very
clean
and
crisp
with
some
caramel
to
it
hops
come
into
play
as
a
tart
lemony
citrus
thats
quite
subdued
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
but
the
carbonation
is
a
bit
high
clean
dry
and
refreshing
easy
to
drink
poured
a
clear
golden
into
a
sa
bl
glass
with
a
good
finger
of
white
head
that
falls
into
a
decent
blanket
cover
for
a
while
and
then
disappears
a
very
mild
aroma
of
sweet
malt
a
faint
hop
note
and
familiar
lager
yeast
light
to
medium
bodied
with
decent
carbonation
a
grainy
flavor
with
a
little
sweetness
and
a
very
faint
hop
bitterness
crisp
clean
finish
very
drinkable
like
many
other
pale
lagers
of
this
abv
range
although
i
dont
visit
this
style
very
often
it
is
easily
the
best
pale
lager
ive
tried
overall
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
no
problem
as
session
barring
the
price
ive
had
it
78
times
over
the
years
and
all
note
point
toward
expensive
but
tasty
overall
id
have
to
say
that
this
is
one
of
the
best
lagers
ive
ever
tasted
take
away
the
skunky
nose
this
would
be
a
superb
lager
although
it
was
served
in
a
brown
bottle
this
obviously
had
sat
on
the
shelf
for
too
long
overall
my
first
organic
brew
it
was
good
and
light
with
very
refreshing
factors
i
enjoyed
it
and
would
drink
it
again
on
a
hot
day
very
light
two
inch
carbonated
head
that
settles
quickly
pours
light
gold
and
pretty
much
clear
light
bitter
smell
actually
smells
a
little
like
a
pilsner
good
fruity
taste
they
skimp
on
the
malt
im
not
particularly
impressed
with
this
beer
however
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
lighter
beers
in
general
you
have
to
respect
it
as
a
good
light
lager
in
fact
if
you
have
a
friend
that
refuses
to
drink
anything
except
for
miller
light
or
bud
light
introduce
them
to
this
it
might
direct
their
taste
toward
the
better
beers
had
samuel
smiths
regular
lager
beer
and
wasnt
too
crazy
about
that
one
its
amazing
what
prouducing
a
beer
organically
can
do
because
this
one
was
the
definite
flipslide
good
appearance
and
smell
coupled
with
a
great
taste
was
more
inline
of
what
i
was
expecting
from
a
good
company
like
samuel
smith
citrus
and
bready
flavors
that
went
down
smooth
as
water
recommended
not
much
of
a
lager
fan
and
being
organic
still
doesnt
make
much
of
a
difference
id
seen
this
for
months
at
my
local
trader
joes
passing
it
by
for
other
beers
each
time
and
i
can
say
that
this
beer
will
likely
become
my
tjs
beer
of
choice
d
a
nice
refreshing
lager
which
could
definitely
serve
as
a
session
beer
but
for
slightly
too
high
an
abv
or
as
the
half
of
a
half
and
half
with
a
good
solid
stout
d
good
i
happy
about
this
bloke
beer
this
organically
produced
lager
is
a
wonderful
beer
i
followed
the
first
550ml
with
another
12oz
that
i
had
bought
and
both
were
great
d
a
little
tasty
goes
down
easy
not
too
filling
good
representation
of
style
decent
kick
this
is
one
of
the
better
organic
beers
that
ive
had
but
there
isnt
enough
to
it
to
make
me
choose
it
unless
i
was
limiting
myself
to
just
organic
beers
a
tasty
thirstquencher
a
nice
easydrinking
lager
from
england
a
country
and
brewery
known
more
for
its
ales
than
lagers
this
one
hits
the
spot
especially
on
a
warm
day
it
reminds
me
too
that
i
havent
tried
the
other
lager
that
this
brewery
produces
in
a
long
time
will
have
to
look
out
for
it
pale
yellow
color
decent
level
of
head
but
average
retention
smells
slightly
bitter
but
nothing
special
tastes
a
little
bitter
but
theres
a
good
balance
of
hops
and
malts
could
be
drank
over
long
sessions
but
theres
not
much
that
keeps
you
coming
back
for
more
its
a
very
average
beer
overall
quite
drinkable
too
bad
it
is
quite
expensive
too
as
organic
goes
this
is
about
as
good
as
it
gets
recommended
for
the
experience
and
if
you
just
have
to
drink
organic
beer
sometime
well
it
basically
tastes
like
a
bland
dortmunder
so
i
guess
thats
on
for
the
style
the
aroma
has
hints
of
skunk
which
doesnt
seem
to
covering
much
up
the
skunk
carries
over
a
bit
in
the
flavor
which
mixes
with
a
bit
of
grassy
hops
then
mostly
creamy
malt
with
a
touch
of
bread
sure
its
drinkable
if
you
dont
mind
paying
over
4
for
a
large
bottle
i
give
this
a
thumbs
down
not
emphatically
but
still
and
i
am
blaming
the
skunk
on
ss
because
it
seems
to
be
so
consistent
in
their
beers
even
with
a
brown
bottle
drinkability
is
great
this
is
not
a
heavy
or
complex
beer
but
a
simple
and
crisp
lager
which
does
what
a
euro
pale
lager
should
very
refreshing
nothing
bad
to
say
about
this
one
except
the
outrageous
price
gimme
a
break
d
this
is
what
a
heineken
becks
should
taste
like
very
drinkable
given
the
right
occasion
and
setting
i
was
suprised
by
this
beer
and
will
purchase
again
pours
a
ultra
clear
ultra
pale
straw
color
thin
head
of
small
white
bubbles
aroma
is
spicy
and
earthy
hops
first
sip
yields
a
balanced
yet
hoppy
flavor
mild
fruit
and
grain
character
clean
and
crisp
mild
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
great
not
nearly
as
light
as
i
expected
from
the
appearance
wonderful
summer
beer
550ml
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
golden
yellow
color
with
a
creamy
white
head
that
quickly
turns
into
a
white
lace
the
aroma
is
grain
a
slight
biscuity
flavor
and
hops
the
taste
starts
out
with
a
smooth
malt
flavor
with
a
slightly
spicey
hop
finish
overall
this
is
a
nice
clean
and
highly
drinkable
lager
pours
a
big
head
that
retains
very
welland
with
al
wonderful
lacing
the
color
is
gold
and
clear
the
head
hasnt
fallen
past
14
yet
the
smell
is
pretty
damn
good
reminds
me
of
the
beer
from
germany
my
first
english
lager
the
smell
is
bready
but
not
over
bready
its
slightly
hopped
as
well
which
balances
it
very
nicely
the
taste
is
a
little
old
the
hoppiness
and
the
breadiness
come
at
you
at
the
same
time
mouthfeel
was
good
nothing
bad
there
overall
i
would
love
to
try
this
again
but
id
like
to
find
a
fresher
bottle
first
not
sure
if
i
would
have
paid
60usd
for
the
case
but
a
damn
fine
beer
nonetheless
color
of
light
straw
with
a
thick
creamy
head
smell
of
sweet
malt
light
hops
and
a
slight
note
of
honey
taste
has
slight
sweet
malt
that
is
clean
and
refreshing
with
a
light
body
an
easy
to
go
down
lager
that
would
be
quinching
on
those
warmer
days
overall
this
is
a
light
refreshing
and
easydrinking
beer
that
serves
as
a
nice
palate
cleanser
with
food
clean
and
refreshing
taste
showing
decent
balance
marred
only
by
a
metallic
tint
at
the
finish
maybe
a
little
sweeter
than
id
like
but
still
crisp
and
drinkable
another
quality
product
from
sam
smiths
showing
that
any
style
can
be
home
to
quality
beer
if
the
brewer
has
talent
and
cares
overall
an
aboveaverage
euro
lager
but
very
drinkable
d
extremely
drinkable
refreshing
if
it
were
not
so
pricey
id
drink
it
more
often
a
special
treat
once
and
awhile
after
pouring
this
lager
that
was
a
medium
light
yellow
in
color
and
very
little
foam
i
was
pleasantly
happy
with
the
flavor
i
could
taste
the
light
hops
and
malts
that
wernt
over
powering
or
like
many
others
tart
and
bitter
this
was
a
very
smooth
and
mellow
lager
this
has
to
be
one
of
my
favorite
lagers
and
will
drink
more
often
other
breweries
should
learn
a
lession
here
overall
very
easy
to
drink
a
nice
session
beer
355ml
brown
bottle
golden
yellow
translucent
body
with
a
quarter
inch
of
white
head
smells
sweet
fruity
and
hoppy
tastes
sweet
and
malty
with
some
hop
clean
finish
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
bodied
with
a
little
less
carbonation
than
one
might
expect
still
pretty
damn
good
for
the
style
though
i
wouldnt
expect
any
less
from
this
brewery
this
is
has
become
a
favorite
to
keep
around
for
both
myself
and
my
father
and
i
would
certainly
recommend
this
to
anyone
looking
for
a
crisp
lager
not
matter
how
the
ingredients
were
grown
or
where
they
came
from
i
found
this
to
be
a
good
lager
under
any
circumstance
and
very
good
an
unremarkable
appearance
gave
way
to
an
interesting
and
layered
taste
sammys
organic
lager
is
a
pretty
standard
europeanstyle
lager
clear
golden
body
short
cap
of
creamy
white
foam
average
head
retention
and
better
than
average
lacing
grassy
and
lightly
floral
hops
in
the
nose
mediumbodied
and
crisp
on
the
palate
straightforward
malt
and
hop
blend
in
the
flavor
seemingly
hallertauer
or
tettnanger
a
touch
of
mineralish
character
solid
bitterness
beneath
wellbalanced
the
fact
that
its
organic
lends
it
point
and
helps
to
balance
its
extra
cost
but
for
the
most
part
there
are
better
golden
lagers
out
there
for
less
one
of
the
very
best
lagers
ive
had
exceptionally
wellmade
irresistable
picked
up
a
550
ml
bottle
at
trader
joes
in
geneva
chilled
to
45
f
poured
a
mediumlight
yellow
with
an
unremarkable
loose
white
head
which
dissipated
quickly
aroma
was
faint
and
unremarkable
for
a
european
pale
lager
flavor
was
of
subdued
malts
and
nice
english
hops
playing
off
each
other
in
a
retrained
and
genteel
manner
the
body
of
this
beer
is
rather
light
which
with
the
evident
but
moderate
hops
bitterness
makes
for
a
very
sessionable
brew
at
3
bucks
for
slightly
over
a
pint
its
not
a
bad
value
but
id
rather
enjoy
some
of
ss
other
more
assertive
offerings
for
that
price
for
a
pale
lager
fan
this
is
a
very
well
balanced
brew
the
mouthfeel
is
tangy
and
light
bodied
this
is
a
unique
lager
that
is
unexpectedly
good
this
is
an
interesting
lager
the
flavor
is
definitely
not
what
youd
expect
and
this
is
anything
but
a
generic
beer
plus
it
helps
the
planet
so
bonus
points
there
this
is
the
first
time
ive
approached
this
beer
but
its
definitely
something
ill
be
picking
up
again
another
great
beer
from
sam
smiths
pours
light
and
clear
with
a
reasonably
fluffy
white
head
the
smell
is
crisp
and
clean
mainly
grain
taste
was
no
suprise
mainly
grains
with
a
touch
of
hops
aftertaste
was
a
little
sweet
but
overall
nice
and
clean
with
only
a
hint
of
fruity
tartness
mouthfeel
was
light
but
not
so
light
it
was
water
for
the
style
this
is
really
great
stuff
plain
simple
no
frills
this
is
what
so
many
other
crappy
lagers
should
taste
like
an
average
brew
not
bad
but
nothing
exciting
if
you
want
to
support
organic
products
then
this
is
a
good
beer
for
you
oh
yeah
the
stick
waving
mob
of
skirted
girls
turns
out
a
bar
regular
has
a
connection
to
the
local
high
school
field
hockey
team
who
won
their
3rd
connsecutive
state
championship
whilst
i
sat
on
my
bar
stool
so
he
bought
a
round
for
the
house
thanks
girls
2
it
is
not
a
style
that
is
high
on
my
radar
i
have
had
this
lager
twice
this
year
once
at
my
brothers
house
and
once
last
week
at
a
local
beer
watering
hole
i
find
this
to
be
a
very
pleasant
tasty
and
enjoyable
lager
its
easy
to
drink
yet
has
more
chartacter
and
flavor
than
your
basic
lager
you
would
find
in
the
us
that
is
mass
produced
good
when
its
cold
but
as
it
warms
up
it
developes
a
nice
malty
smell
and
flavor
in
the
past
i
have
not
paid
attention
too
much
to
english
beers
but
this
is
an
example
that
has
changed
my
mind
i
will
be
sampling
more
in
the
future
i
would
recommend
this
beer
drink
this
beer
when
you
just
want
to
chill
out
damn
nice
clean
lager
very
nice
samuel
smith
has
yet
to
disappoint
me
and
once
again
tad
delivers
from
the
550ml
brown
bottle
it
poured
a
beautiful
deep
yellowish
golden
colr
and
a
firm
one
finger
head
that
faded
to
a
thin
layer
that
lasted
about
34
of
the
drink
nice
lacing
throughout
my
initial
thoughts
on
aroma
were
floral
and
bit
sweet
a
touch
of
grain
and
not
the
usual
lager
smell
that
im
used
to
what
a
relief
tastes
were
a
very
nice
balance
of
slight
hoppy
bitterness
up
front
followed
by
a
grainy
malty
smoothness
golden
a
bit
of
grassiness
in
the
flavor
but
just
a
touch
mouthfeel
is
clean
crisp
smooth
and
not
too
dry
primo
lager
in
my
book
yes
maam
ill
have
another
drinks
pretty
easy
nothing
too
complex
here
but
good
for
a
few
pints
to
be
sure
poured
from
the
bottle
to
a
golden
yellow
color
with
medium
thick
white
head
that
lasted
for
most
of
the
glass
and
left
good
lacing
aroma
is
very
hoppy
with
a
hint
of
floral
taste
is
more
hops
with
no
real
recognizable
flavor
jumping
out
palte
is
on
the
dry
side
but
not
bad
i
have
tried
several
samuel
smith
beers
and
while
most
are
decent
i
dont
find
any
to
be
outstanding
and
this
fits
in
that
same
mold
this
is
quite
a
refreshingly
tasty
brew
i
did
not
quite
know
what
to
expect
from
this
beer
but
am
pleasantly
surprised
i
really
like
the
light
honey
note
that
runs
throughout
this
beer
it
is
a
nice
mix
of
organic
malt
and
hops
overall
an
ok
lager
nothing
spectacular
but
worth
a
try
drinkable
yes
have
a
few
no
problem
i
dont
think
that
ive
been
disappointed
with
any
of
the
sam
smiths
products
and
this
although
no
star
was
also
no
exception
the
beer
is
clear
and
golden
with
a
thick
white
lace
producing
head
the
aroma
is
clean
and
a

this

poured
from
a
7oz

my

in

back
from

is
a

with
no

aromas
of
toasted

hints
of

im

is

the

i
can
see
drinking
this
in
large
quantities
on
a
beach
in
aruba
devoid
of
other
options
always
skunky
better
than
nothing
i
would
like
to
visit
aruba
someday
served
in
a
can
still
it
was
nice
to
have
a
cold
one
on
a
nice
hot
day
in
aruba
right
about
now
i
would
like
to
be
back
there
o
4
i
enjoyed
many
of
these
down
on
the
happy
island
of
aruba
it
is
a
great
summery
beer
overall
not
a
bad
beer
to
have
when
youre
sweating
on
the
beach
but
it
is
nothing
to
be
savored
would
likely
lose
its
appeal
in
any
other
setting
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
preferred
cocktails
on
my
stay
in
aruba
currently
sitting
by
the
pool
and
enjoying
one
fresh
although
yes
this
may
not
be
a
great
beer
it
is
good
for
what
it
is
decent
taste
nothing
really
to
note
on
color
or
mouthfeel
it
is
cool
to
have
while
in
aruba
as
i
would
much
prefer
it
to
other
american
light
beers
but
this
is
nothing
to
seek
out
drink
it
if
its
free
otherwise
avoid
it
bland
and
generic
honeymoon
in
aruba
and
lets
just
say
craft
beer
hasnt
come
into
vogue
on
the
scorching
desert
of
an
island
balashi
is
the
aruba
beer
and
you
can
find
it
everywhere
i
got
the
chance
to
try
this
on
tap
in
green
12oz
bottles
and
in
brown
7oz
bottles
it
makes
no
difference
the
beer
is
a
pretty
crappy
macro
lager
smells
and
tastes
like
youd
expect
light
with
hints
of
corn
honey
grains
and
some
skunk
i
often
found
a
mineral
taste
but
not
always
when
in
aruba
this
is
certainly
your
freshest
choice
but
certainly
nothing
to
get
excited
about
o
nothing
really
special
but
its
about
context
for
something
light
and
refreshingi
its
a
good
option
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
low
to
medium
carbonation
lacks
a
bit
in
flavour
but
a
decent
enough
hot
weather
beer
refreshing
thanks

overall
had
this
beer
on

during

rated
higher
on

scale
than
it
deserved

the
local
beer
just

places
i

mouthfeel

with
a
wonderful

that
was
present
when
i
exhaled
not
a
bad
choice
when
visiting
aruba
better
on

than
from
a
bottle
i
had
balashi
via
cans
and
draft
while
in
aruba
on
our
honeymoon
i
did
not
drink
anything
else
there
but
balashi
this
is
a
very
underrated
beer
the
beer
is
made
by
aruban
water
so
fresh
and
crisp
the
beer
has
a
deep
golden
color
totally
clear
and
transparent
with
a
bitterness
which
is
soft
to
the
tongue
and
nose
however
with
an
aroma
of
fresh
hops
a
short
aftertaste
and
easy
on
foam
the
combination
of
all
feels
fresh
and
smooth
to
the
mouth
when
cold
perfect
for
arubas
hot
climate
i
brought
a
beer
back
with
me
to
the
states
to
give
to
a
friend
who
went
to
aruba
years
ago
and
he
shut
his
eyes
and
sighed
thats
the
balashi
i
missed
in
aruba
this
beer
temporarily
takes
drinkers
back
to
paradise
you
have
to
be
in
aruba
or
there
before
in
order
to
fully
appreciate
this
lager

off

list
d
goes
down
very
easy
not
much
kick
not
filling
at
all
i
believe
this
beer
is
misclassfified
as
it
is
more
in
line
with
a
pilsner
than
a
macro
this
beer
is
one
that
you
can
throw
back
all
day
long
and
works
with
the
heat
of
an
aruban
day
one
should
note
that
i
gav
a
quick
google
search
to
see
if
i
can
buy
it
in
the
us
apparently
not
but
i
can
see
from
several
chat
rooms
that
im
not
the
only
one
looking
for
this
suds
stateside
f
somewhat
crisp
lager
flavors
with
a
slight
lingering
toasty
malt
but
mostly
the
syrupy
adjunct
flavors
linger
on
the
finish
it
leaves
a
touch
of
wheat
as
well
it
finishes
pretty
quick
too
almost
like
water
but
leaves
that
macro
adjunct
syrupy
flavor
too
long
much
better
than
any
macro
a
perfect
summer

beer
wish
it
was
available
up
here
for
sure
feeldrink
mouth
and
drinkablity
are
both
good
nice
carbonation
but
not
too
crazy
like
most
aals
i
did
it
again
overall
aruba
did
an
okay
job
then
again
when
one
is
in
aruba
if
the
only
thing
you
have
to
complain
about
is
the
fact
that
there
is
no
great
beer
than
you
should
probably
just
go
with
the
flow
and
keep
your
pie
hole
shut
a
can
brought
to
me
straight
from
aruba
pours
a
yellow
orange
color
into
a
pint
glass
with
a
small
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
leaving
average
lacing
nothing
exemplary
smells
of
corn
and
sugar
with
an
herbal
tea
like
background
tastes
like
corn
seltzer
with
green
or
white
tea
steeped
in
it
mixed
half
and
half
with
bitter
apple
juice
mouthfeel
is
surprisingly
nice
well
carbonated
this
is
the
beers
only

its
light
but
i
cant
imagine
having
more

3
d
highly
drinkable
it
is
good
on
a
hot
day
but
there
are
better
pilsners
out
there
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
in
aruba
drinkability
is
ok
here
with
60
other
beers
stashed
around
the
house
it
is
no
big
deal
balashi
is
a
beer
that
is
best
drank
within
its
environment
just
like
red
stripe
is
reminds
me
of
a
less
skunky
heineken
the
pickin
is
slim
in
aruba
so
this
is
my
top
beer
choice
both
the
can
bottle
were
equal
in
taste
and
they
say
5
abv
d
a
fairly
drinkable
beer
despite
the
pretty
sour
taste
the
smooth
and
refreshing
feel
of
the
beer
overcame
the
biting
taste
to
make
it
somewhat
enjoyable
while
i
sat
in
the
hot
aruban
sun
i
had
fun
with
this
beer
average

color
nice

taste
was
smooth
and
crisp
it
was
kind
of
intesting
it
was
11oz

but
it
seemed
to
be
just
enough
no
realy
hops
or
malts
jumped
out
just
an
average
tasting
pils
but
it
was
a
little
sweet
cheers
bon
bini
pretty
aggressive
carbonation
pricks
the
tongue
which
overwhelms
the

it

go

beer
in

pours
a
clear
golden
yellow
with
a
white
head
aroma
is
slightly
hoppy
taste
was
fairly
clean
with
a
little
more
bite
than
the
other
yellow
beers
that
aruba
had
to
offer
polar
bud
etc
drinks
very
easily
especially
when
ice
cold
probably
not
a
choice
id
pick
up
here
in
the
us
but
after
snorkeling
at
baby
beach
this
seemed
like
the
perfect
beer
to
quench
my
thirst
i
greatly
enjoyed
this
beer
pretty
much
stuck
with
it
for
my
entire
vacation
this
beer
isnt
perfect
but
hard
to
beat
when
its
90
degrees
and
there
is
sand
between
your
toes
and
its
better
than
most
of
what
is
readily
available
when
in
aruba
i
prefer
this
on
ontap
i
could
not
tell
any
difference
from
the
tap
version
nice
beach
beer
its
an
improvement
over
your
bud
and
millers
etc
though
i
think
its
optimally
drank
while
relaxing
poolsideon
the
beach
versus
with
your
dinner
back
home
finally
i
rated
drinkability
as
exceptional
because
despite
its
mild
flavor
that
flavor
holds
up
glass
after
glass
you
couldi
havedrink
glass
after
glass
of
balashi
and
each
one
would
be
as
refreshing
and
satisfying
as
the
first
it
does
not
overpower
foodit
has
just
enough
flavor
to
be
consistently
interesting
t
thin
body
with
heavy
carbonation
actually
creates
pleasant
mouthfeel
taste
isnt
bad
light

body
with
a

from

d
sweet
buttery
and
an
easy
drinking
beer
perfect
for
the
beaches
of

good
beer
in
regards
to
its
environment
d
i
could
definatley
knock
a
few
of
these
back
on
a
hot
island
day
i
will
seek
this
out
if
ever
in
aruba
not
bad
a
better
alternative
than
the
bmc
crew
d
well
when
aruba
i
drank
a
ton
of
these
if
i
ever
go
back
ill
do
it
again
not
a
terrible
brew
easy
to
drink
and
on
a
hot
aruba
day
id
put
a
few
more
away
again
overall
a
drinkable
beer
that
went
pretty
good
with
my
spicy
spinach
curry
more
hops
and
a
bit
juicier
malt
backbone
wouldve
been
welcome
lightbodied
and
quite
fizzy
maybe
in
the
heat
of
the
tropics
it
is
a
thirstquencher
but
thats
about
it
of
note
i
did
prefer
the
bottle
over
the
canned
a
very
transparent
golden
color
with
a
pretty
big
head
that
calms
down
to
near
nothing
within
a
few
minutes
no
lacing
evident
it
smells
of
musty
grains
and
grass
and
perhaps
a
hint
of
the
can
as
well
not
overly
attractive
but
passable
at
first
the
cold
brew
had
a
vague
citruswheat
taste
and
a
slight
bitterness
at
the
back
but
as
it
warmed
a
few
degrees
it
seemed
to
improve
taking
on
a
slightly
maltier
flavor
certainly
refreshing
and
pretty
drinkable
but
it
leaves
that
dryness
at
the
back
of
your
mouth
that
isnt
very
consistent
with
what
you
want
for
refreshment
it
is
nicely
carbonated
to
help
the
quenching
process
but
overall
this
is
ordinary
faire
pours
a
pale
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
in
the
nose
was
a
european
saaz
hopand
small
amount
of
earthiness
tastes
dry
for
a
lager
and
a
small
presence
of
hops
a
very
clean
smooth
beer
not
much
in
aftertaste
yet
very
refreshing
close
similarities
to
an
american
macro
lager
but
a
little
different
with
the
earthiness
from
what
i
can
recall
abv
was
5
0
maybe
5
5
i
rated
drinkability
higher
only
because
these
went
down
very
easily
in
the
hot
aruba
sun
and
was
actually
refreshing
overall
this
one
is
great
when
you
are
sitting
under
some
shade
enjoying
the
cool
breezes
off
the
water
an
earlier
reviewer
is
way
off
topic
in
respect
to
the
water
especially
since
their
stateoftheart
desalination
plant
is
prevalent
from
most
of
the
nontouristy
areas
the
bars
in
aruba
only
seem
to
carry
this
and
the
usual
macro
brews
so
you
may
as
well
give
balashi
a
try
especially
since
it
is
very
unlikely
you
will
come
across
balashi
anywhere
else
even
if
they
still
dont
do
tours
i
think
they
have
friday
night
events
at
the
brewery
so
check
it
out
when
you
are
lucky
enough
to
get
down
there
dont
be
fooled
by
the
natalie
holloway
news
arbua
is
a
safe
island
and
the
locals
are
friendly
on
a
side
note
not
really
related
to
the
scoring
many
of
the
locals
in
aruba
drink
a
venezuelan
import
not
balashi
i
do
give
credit
for
this
small
island
brewing
their
own
and
marketing
it
filtered
down
watery
americanpilsener
style
lager
tastes
just
like
budweiser
which
i
believe
has
a
share
in
the
brewery
go
figure
not
that
much
of
a
head
not
many
hops
to
speak
of
smooth
enough
other
than
that
its
from
aruba
this
is
fairly
normal
fairly
boring
too
i
had
this
beer
on
a
recent
trip
to
aruba
light
bodied
beer
this
is
a
light
pilsner
beer
modeled
after
the
dutch
pilsners
due
to
the
obvious
dutch
influence
in
the
area
very
refreshing
beer
with
little
after
taste
perfect
for
a
day
at
the
beach
i
was
very
impressed
pswhen
you
ask
for
it
ask
for
belushi
with
a
u
wait
till
you
see
the
expression
you
get
thanks
to
mom
dad
for
bringing
this
back
from
aruba
for
me
pours
a
crystal
clearmedium
straw
color
with
a
good
head
but
not
so
good
lace
the
head
also
faded
rather
quickly
i
didnt
even
have
to
get
my
nose
close
to
the
glass
to
smell
the
skunk
if
you
can
get
through
it
there
are
some
average
pilsner
sweet
malt
aromas
taste
of
an
average
macro
but
ill
bet
it
tastes
great
on
the
beach
in
aruba
a
typical
macro
pilsner
a
brown
bottle
would
make
this
better
keep
out
more
light
easy
going
down
thus
high
drinkability
not
a
bad
beer
will
do
in
a
pinch
except
for
the
skunkiness
its

packed
on

add
who
knows
how
many
drunken
tourists
turn
up
the
heat
now
let
nature
kick
in
with
everyone
shitting
and
pissing
where
do
you
think
all
that
festering
sewage
is
going
to
go
nowhere
fortunately
the
arubans
came
up
with
a
plan
it
involved
little
green
and
silver
22cl
cans
when
i
go
back
i
will
probably
hit
some
of
the
grocery
stores
and
see
if
i
can
score
some
guinness
draught
or
foreign
stout
as
i
uncovered
that
on
the
last
days
of
our
trip
maybe
it
just
got
skunked
maybe
i
got
a
bad
one
however
since
i
have
no
other
fresh
ones
to
compare
it
to
i
would
suggest
you
only
drink
it
if
you
like
licking
postage
stamps
and
gnawing
on
cardboard
cheers
golden
in
color
and
completely
transparent
with
minimal
head
hop
presence
on
the
nose
with
a
soft
yet
forward
bitter
hoppy
flavor
and
a
sufficient
dryness
nothing
particularly
outstanding
in
the
flavor
carbonation
is
moderate
with
a
very
brief
finish
best
to
not
let
this
one
get
warm
it
looks
just
like
any
other
massproduced
pilsner
but
has
a
very
uninviting
taste
of
metal
and
corn
very
little
aroma
if
any
at
all
i
would
not
get
this
again

overall

if
i
was

for

on

we
dont

i
would

for

geeksnob
but
has
its

in

world
per
se
the
beer
is
not
undrinkable
but
is
without
any
claim
without
elements
of
interest
and
ultimately
noise
and
essentially
useless
fortunately
that
has
at
least
a
few
alcohol
degrees
few
aromas
on
the
nose
a
very
important
carbonation
that
gives
the
body
enough
sparkling
as
far
as
taste
we
feel
the
grain
but
without
much
conviction
just
like
a
beast
europeanstyle

and
so
it
remains
watery
as
for
the

it
is
not

enough
to
raise

finding

and
this
is
the
beer
ive
choosen
to
chill

pleasant

and
you
can
just
about
feel
the

abv
within
it
no
huge
flavours
or

though
just
a
run
of
the
mill
euro
pop
sort
of
beer
ive
drank
it
many
times
on
spanish
islands
ibiza
and
formentera
and
have
never
had
any
problems
with
it
ideal
for
quenching
a
thirst
on
a
hot
day
but
not
a
must
have
at
all
costs
sort
of
thing
better
than
average
but
only
just
dhad
this
last
night
wa
spicy
dish
an
interesting
chicken
in
cocoa
sauce
the
beer
went
okay
wit
but
at
times
the
phenolic
bandaid
still
showed
through
yes
this
beer
has
a
lot
wrong
with
it
but
its
still
drinkable
wfare
that
drowns
out
the
flaws
d
wouldnt
seek
this
out
necessarily
but
not
horrible
either
d
not
bad
when
youre
thirsty
unavoidable
to
drink
once
youre
in
catalunya
overall
a
delicate
and
well
balanced
refreshing
lager
these
went
down
very
easily
d
if
youre
going
to
quench
your
thirst
this
could
work
but
if
your
not
into
the
very
pale
lager
with
small
taste
and
aroma
i
suggest
you
avoid
this
one
i
had
this
ontap
in
barcelona
and
was
more
pleased
with
the
result
than
i
thought
i
would
be
it
pours
a
hazy
sort
of
yellowish
type
of
color
with
a
fizzy
head
and
give
off
almost
no
smell
at
all
i
was
able
to
detect
the
maltiness
afterwards
but
it
never
left
any
adverse
taste
in
my
mouth
i
would
try
this
again
but
only
if
i
could
find
it
ontap
pours
a
solid
dense
bright
white
head
that
fades
quickly
leaving
a
few
specs
of
lace
the
pale
yellow
beer
holds
a
few
streams
of
carbonation
aroma
of
a
nice
pils
its
a
mix
of
light
malt
sweetness
and
herbal
hops
the
pale
malt
sweetness
is
a
bit
overpowering
and
the
mild
hop
bite
doesnt
stand
a
chance
there
is
a
faint
stale
grain
flavor
that
tarnishes
the
flavor
and
the
beer
has
a
kind
of
corn
sugar
tasting
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
simply
average
it
is
too
sweet
and
there
are
some
faint
off
flavors
that
bring
this
beer
down
its
a
notsogood
pilsner
which
i
guess
is
what
makes
it
a
euro
pale
lager
i
tried
this
beer
for
the
sake
of
trying
it
going
in
without
any
high
expectations
had
it
iced
cold
in
a
pint
glass
poured
a
bubbly
plale
yellow
color
with
a
fast
fizzing
head
smelled
of
mild
hops
and
a
little
sweetness
taste
was
thin
and
barely
hopped
with
a
touch
of
citrus
an
ok
beer
to
sip
on
a
hot
day
but
dont
go
nuts
nothing
really
sets
this
beer
apart
but
it
is
very
drinkable
it
would
make
a
great
session
beer
pours
a
white
frothy
head
with
a
good
lacing
most
of
the
head
diminishes
rather
quickly
but
about
3
mm
head
remains
clear
yellow
sparkling
body
fairly
weak
aroma
just
like
many
other
mass
produced
pale
lagers
the
initial
flavor
is
a
little
bit
sweet
but
it
soon
turns
into
a
more
bitter
flavor
it
doesnt
taste
of
that
much
apart
from
this
slight
bitter
taste
light
to
medium
body
with
a
dry
texture
overall
i
must
admit
that
the
initial
taste
wasnt
too
bad
however
it
was
followed
by
a
horrible
acidity
characteristic
of
many
mass
produced
lagers
a
one
dimensional
beer
with
many
flaws
but
at
least
the
taste
is
better
than
some
of
the
other
macrolagers
it
would
take
a
pub
with
a
really
poor
selection
to
force
me
onto

the

not

it
clearly
smells

this
one
is
not

would
not

i
have
tasted
this
one
right
after
a
local
brew
from
my
hometown
and
this
one
was
by
far
the
more
pleasant
lager
so
have
to
be
careful
not
to
overrate
this
one

first
impression
is
a
full

and
a
malty

another

of
this

not

i
think
i
liked

most
certainly
not
the
most

easy

not

this

ive

i
would

paid

then
give
him
that
amount
and
pour
the

down

avoid
this
not

but
it

can
see

some

the

light

active

and
a
crisp

as
decidedly
unimpressive

the

are
this

does
go

pretty

overall
about
an
average
beer
across
the
board
pretty
inoffensive
and
easy
to
drink
beer
with
a
decent
amount
of
floral
and
grassy
hops
it
was
a
nice
beer
to
drink
but
pretty
forgettable
d
this
beer
has
a
nice
flavor
to
the
malt
but
it
is
covered
by
the
carbonic
acid
except
for
the
hop
note
the
slight
sweetness
to
the
sulfury
finish
has
a
nice
kolsch
quality
its
just
covered
up
knock
another
country
of
my
list
and
i
could
swallow
it
without
issues
i
honestly
expected
less
from
north
african
beer
so
i
was
pleased
with
a
straight
across
the
board
average
beer
d
better
than
i
expected
but
not
worth
revisiting
beer
from
morocco
whoda
thunk
it
yet
the
nights
still
relatively
young
stay
tuned
drinkability
quite
average
from
top
to
bottom
casablanca
a
fantastic
movie
but
a
not
so
great
beer
the
beer
is
golden
orange
in
color
it
has
a
white
foam
head
and
lots
of
carbonation
bubbles
in
the
glass
there
is
a
little
earthy
yeast
in
the
aroma
but
there
really
isnt
much
going
on
the
taste
has
a
lot
of
cheap
malts
and
some
corn
it
tastes
better
than
some
american
macros
but
still
not
that
great
it
has
a
medium
body
and
a
lot
of
carbonation
it
goes
down
easy
but
it
isnt
that
enjoyable
to
drink
i
didnt
order
a
second
bottle
and
probably
never
will
this
is
very
drinkable
stuff
id
have
no
problem
drinking
these
at
the
oasis
drinkability
on
a
warm
day
pretty
drinkable
otherwise
pretty
average
certainly
not
the
worst
macro
lager
ive
had
but
not
an
outstanding
beer
d
im
trying
hard
to
find
something
positive
about
this
beer
and
this
is
it
its
easy
to
drink
because
its
quite
bland
and
well
carbonated
i
would
think
this
would
be
a
suitable
beer
brewed
from
an
african
country
where
its
hot
all
the
time
as
this
would
go
down
easy
on
summer
afternoon
i
dont
think
ill
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
this
again
however
light
bodied
and
fairly
smooth
drinking
i
would
reccommend
this
to
a
macro
drinker
who
wants
to
try
something
new
a
very
decent
brew
for
what
it
is
pretty
average
for
the
style
but
points
for
lack
of
skunkiness
back
to
the
change
in
taste
it
would
have
been
pretty
damn
good
before
the
flavor
shift
it
could
have
been
quite
drinkable
im
not
sure
if
it
was
old
not
cold
enough
or
just
me
but
it
just
tasted
funny
after
just
a
few
minutes
if
only
it
stayed
the
way
it
started
that
said
i
would
try
it
again
if
either
i
found
a
bottle
with
no
sediment
or
i
was
in
morocco
again
casa
beer
is
a
very
sparkling
golden
lager
with
a
small
dense
slightly
offwhite
head
that
has
good
retention
and
lacing
it
has
a
faint
light
grain
aroma
with
a
note
of
fruitiness
noble
characteristics
it
is
light
bodied
and
smooth
with
a
crisp
dry
finish
it
has
a
light
inoffensive
taste
with
notes
of
lemon
and
pepper
there
is
a
slightly
roasted
flavor
that
surprised
me
and
a
slight
hint
of
fruity
wooden
hops
this
is
much
better
than
i
expected
d
if
im
ever
in
morocco
it
looks
like
ill
be
able
to
grab
a
beer
that
is
at
least
inoffensive
this
beer
is
about
as
generic
as
beer
can
get
i
like
this
beer
no
idea
of
its
style
typing
this
up
in
notepad
it
is
not
a
lighter
beer
though
the
appearance
might
fool
you
into
thinking
it
is
good
medium
body
and
very
light
on
the
carbonation
i
could
drink
a
few
more
pours

and
watery
great
for
a
sunny
day
by
the
pool
maybe
but
not
a
cold
winters
night
in
the
uk
i
should
have
held
my
lager
evening
in
the
summer
this
had
no
great
flavours
or
tastes
to
elaborate
on
just
a
lager
and
another
country
ticked
off
in
my
quest
to

bottle

a
clear
light
golden
color
with
a
small
white

a
light

the

was
quite
nice

and

very
crisp
and
clean
flavor
a
nice
pale
lager
smooth
and
enjoyable
but
not
my
favorite
style
overall
this
is
just
another
average
beer
it
was
quite
refreshing
but
it
is
surely
nothing
special
drinkability
was
pretty
top
notch
its
a
good
lager
not
great
but
not
terrible
either
an
average
beer
with
a
cool
bottle
not
clean
or
refreshing
honestly
not
sure
how
this
can
sell
other
than
for
the
novelty
factor
or
beer
hunters
trying
everthing
once
pass
finish
is
a
turn
off
but
otherwise
it
is
palatable
decent
looking
enough
lager
richer
head
than
most
and
it
sticks
around
as
does
some
lacing
some
cooked
veggies
tend
to
mask
the
bready
malt
and
floral
hop
that
is
there
taste
is
quite
decent
given
its
classmates
aforemention
breadylike
malt
and
hop
make
an
appearance
as
does
a
slight
metaliic
twang
lighter
in
body
but
also
slick
and
smooth
going
down
wouldnt
mind
another
in
a
cafe
in

i
could

detection

the
religious
police

hazed

gold
with

leaves
a
pretty
fair
amount

there

a

well
flavor
is
slightly
bitter
citric
a
touch
of

i
guess
nothing
to
really
write
home
about
if
i
were
in
morocco
i
am
sure
my
choices
would
be
limited
so
it
would
have
to
do
but
for
here
in
the
u
s
no
great
shakes
but
a
little
bit
better
than
i
had
expected
it
is
essentially
nondescript
yellow
white
head
little
retention
aroma
and
taste
are
bland
little
noticeable
malts
no
hoppiness
at
all
it
went
decently
on
a
very
hot
day
in
florida
but
not
a
lot
better
than
bud
or
miller
that
being
said
i
had
this
beer
in
morocco
if
you
can
get
any
beer
in
a
muslim
country
you
are
lucky
its
just
hard
to
come
by
this
is
a
beer
that
you
drink
because
you
want
a
beer
and
you
want
to
tell
people
you
had
a
moroccan
beer
thats
really
it
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
your
way
to
seek
this
beer
out
but
i
would
certainly
recommend
it
if
you
are
in
morocco
just
because
the
others
are
not
very
good
its
very
much
like
the
bud
of
morocco

had
again
3

years

fresh
from

and
decent
mouthfeel
its
drinkable
enough
and
just
a
tad
more
interesting

satisfying
than
most
bottom
shelf
lagers
but
not
worth
the
1

i
paid
i
wonder
how
well
this
sells
in
its
home
country
taste
well
about
the
same
as
the
smell
the
style
says
it
all
american
macro
lager
its
just
like
a
big
name
american
lager
this
does
seem
to
be
a
bit
more
drinkable
to
me
than
the
large
american
ones
the
mouthfeel
was
like
water
nothing
really
stood
out
with
this
beer
it
would
be
a
beer
for
a
warm
summer
day
at
the
lake
it
was
refreshing
and
light
which
makes
it
an
easy
drinking
beer

is
crisp
with
a
mild
dry
sweetness

theres

it

all
that
being
said
casablanca
is
otherwise
an
alright
beer
uf
ok
for
quenching
thirst
before
moving
up
to
something
better
i
could
definitely
drink
a
few
of
these
if
i
ever
get
stranded
in
casablanca
for
a
few
days
this
one
has
a
few
faults
but
is
better
than
the
american
macros
bland
a
waste
of
the
ingredients
this
lager
poured
a
clear
light
golden
color
with
white
foam
that
settled
completely
the
smell
was
modest
a
thin
sweetish
smell
corn
with
an
ever
so
slight
touch
of
floral
hops
the
taste
was
not
bad
but
thin
sweetish
malt
with
a
bit
of
floral
hops
and
some
bitter
hops
especially
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
crisp
and
fairly
dry
with
mediumlight
body
and
low
carbonation
there
was
a
light
lingering
hoppy
flavor
this
was
a
decent
light
refreshing
lager
one
of
those
plain
simple
lagers
that
is
likeable
but
not
lovable
pours
into
the
mug
with
ample
carbonation
leaving
a
pristine
white
head
atop
a
maple
gold
liquid
strings
of
lace
were
left
on
the
glass
which
slowly
crept
down
to
meet
with
the
beer
fruity
citrus
hop
smell
with
a
bit
of
malt
on
the
front
of
the
nose
hmm
nice
taste
somewhat
complex
sweet
malt
citrus
hop
bitter
hop
lime
oranges
almonds
pecans
and
something
uniquely
else
something
unique
some
sort
of
african
grass
it
was
grainygrassy
and
bitter
whatever
it
was
i
like
it
crisp
biting
mouthfeel
that
leaves
the
tongue
and
cheeks
refreshed
one
of
the
best
pale
lagers
ive
had
highly
drinkable
if
i
can
find
this
back
home
itll
be
a
staple
in
my
fridge
taste
is
creamy
and
grassy
lightly
fruity
of
all
things
hey
someone
hopped
this
eurostyle
lager
nicely
hopped
for
the
style
but
not
crisp
like
a
pilsner
an
odd
combonation
that
makes
for
a
nice
flavor
mouth
is
creamy
vs
crisp
with
a
bitter
hoppy
aftertaste
very
smooth
and
tasty
i
like
others
had
this
at
the
moroccan
area
at
epcot
and
was
pleasantly
surprised
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
aromas
of
saaz
hops
and
malt
this
follows
in
the
flavor
with
a
decently
hoppy
bitterness
following
the
malt
good
feel
from
the
highly
ample
carbonation
the
is
a
reasonably
dry
finish
highly
drinakble
for
a
pale
lager
12
ounce
bottle
the
bottle
is
a
very
light
brown
color
with
a
pretty
nifty
label
i
thought
this
must
be
a
little
different
since
it
was
from
half
a
world
away
but
i
guess
not
regular
macroyellow
in
color
with
a
fluffy
head
tastes
like
any
us
macro
nothing
offensive
but
nothing
with
any
big
hops
malt
or
other
flavor
only
they
slapped
a
different
label
on
it
the
label
may
be
the
best
part
sampled
at
the
moroccan
pavillion
at
epcot
it
poured
with
an
average
white
colored
head
that
settled
over
deep
goldenamber
liquid
some
lightly
toasty
and
sweet
malt
with
light
hops
in
the
nose
the
taste
is
mediumdry
maltiness
balanced
by
some
out
of
place
alelike
fruitiness
and
a
pleasant
hoppy
flavor
finishes
slightly
sharp
and
bitter
very
interesting
flavors
in
this
beer
a
rather
odd
liquorlike
flavor
here
a
distinctive
tequila
whang
sort
of
like
tequiza
without
the
lime
and
less
corn
beneath
the
liquor
flavors
was
a
huskyness
that
bordered
on
harsh
but
held
back
just
a
bit
sampled
at
epcot
as
i
tried
to
drink
my
way
around
the
world
glad
this
was
not
the
end
of
the
earth
as
it
would
be
a
sorry
beer
to
end
the
day
with
as
good
a
a
beer
from
morocco
could
be
and
better
than
most
internationl
lagers
strange
flavours
of
rubber
and
sand
bit
salty
aswell
sweet
malts
to
start
crisp
finish
stale
hops
not
a
very
good
beer
in
the
end
bland
and
plain
crappy
but
as
i
said
before
not
as
bad
as
some
for
once
a
lager
that
i
really
enjoyed
drinking
and
rating
because
of
the
flavor
when
poured
into
my
glass
it
had
a
medium
sized
white
and
creamy
head
with
finemedium
sized
bubbles
the
body
had
a
lot
of
lively
carbonation
and
it
was
cloudy
the
hue
of
this
beer
was
yellowgold
and
it
left
a
good
lacing
on
the
sides
of
my
glass
the
nose
was
lightly
malty
hoppy
and
fruity
the
flavor
was
hops
and
it
was
also
smooth
the
mouthfeel
was
tingly
on
my
tongue
and
somewhat
thin
the
more
i
drank
of
this
beer
the
more
i
liked
it
i
found
this
in
the
morocco
section
at
epcot
i
wasnt
expecting
much
but
was
pleasantly
surprised
a
solid
refreshing
lager
overall
this
is
an
interesting
lager
there
is
a
variety
of
flavors
on
tap
at
rattlr
n
hum
nyc
nice
all
one
could
want
from
a
lager
cosmetics
aside
this
really
hit
the
spot
major
plus
was
texture
the
lingering
aftertaste
the
dryness
is
just
right
why
on
earth
does
it
only
have
a
41
rating
from
the
other
guys
im
in
on
this
one
truthfully
there
is
less
of
a
corny
essence
than
in
most
aals
but
the
corn
is
still
annoyingly
there
in
the
background
also
the
hop
character
on
the
backend
makes
it
mildly
more
enjoyable
than
an
aal
nice
light
bready
and
biscuity
odd
unexpected
malty
backbone
different
but
good
would
session
if
priced
right

a

off
with

malty
caramel
taste
and
then
is
infused
with
a

floral

presence
towads
the
end
i

it
to

with
creamy
malt
and
light
hop
with
floral
sweet
quality
and
mild
yeast
adding
a
creamy
taste
with
mild
hop
bitterness
to
balance
the
malt
sweetness
which
is
toasty
and
light
with
a
low
alcohol
flavor
if
any
in
the
taste
mostly
herbal
hops
in
the
finish
overall
excellent
lager
in
the
general
sense
a
bit
generic
however
it
is
slightly
more
hop
flavored
than
your
average
harp
or
whatever
is
sold
as
irish
lager
very
drinkable
yet
still
has
a
goodly
amount
of
flavor
for
a
4
6
lager
and
it
fits
the
style
well
poured
from
a
22oz
look
very
thick
light
head
with
earthy
golden
color
beer
smell
rough
and
loud
at
first
but
softer
after
that
taste
very
good
floral
tasting
feel
thin
and
lingering
overall
would
love
it
to
feel
and
taste
thicker
but
i
liked
it
im
no
expert
but
as
someone
who
is
looking
to
be
well
versed
in
the
world
of
alcohol
this
has
been
a
great
introductory
beer
an
incredible
version
of
a
euro
style
lager
better
then
the
european
versions
not
bad
not
a
whole
lot
of
body
pours
a
murky
light
orange
with
a
foamy
beige
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
tiny
dots
of
lace
slowly
drip
into
the
remaining
beer
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
grain
and
grass
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
grain
grass
and
slight
fruity
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
very
mild
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
is
tasty
but
the
smell
on
this
one
is
slightly
better
in
my
opinion
overall
pretty
standard
euro
lager
definitely
drink
when
nice
and
cold
on
a
hot
summer
day
overall
not
a
strong
style
and
one
of
the
least
attractive
offerings
from
rogue
pours
a
richly
dark
straw
hue
a
bit
hazy
minimal
foam
although
i
poured
softer
than
usual
so
that
may
have
been
my
fault
aroma
a
bit
grassy
but
couldnt
pick
up
too
much
else
due
to
the
improper
pour
taste
of
cereal
grains
biscuity
nothing
complex
or
layered
to
my
palate
bit
of
a
hollow
mouthfeel
crisp
with
a
dry
finish
overall
a
pretty
solid
take
on
the
euro
pale
lager
style
nice
biscuit
malt
taste
with
some
good
fruit
notes
o
i
think
i
have
a
new
favorite
lager
comments
how
bud
and
coors
should
taste
the
taste
is
vibrant
with
pale
malts
sweetness
with
an
low
to
moderate
bitter
finish
that
lingers
and
coats
the
back
of
my
throat
it
meets
the
test
of
the
style
i
believe
rogue
has
been
disappointing
in
many
of
its
recent
offerings
but
not
here
this
isnt
a
style
that
id
clamor
over
but
id
drink
this
brew
whenever
its
offered
o
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
seems
to
be
a
lot
more
flavorful
compared
to
other
beers
in
the
style
especially
since
there
are
no
adjunct
malts
it
was
a
nice
selection
for
an
unseasonably
warm
spring
day
poured
from
a
650ml
bottle
this
pours
a
saturated
rich
yellow
colour
the
nose
has
clean
grainy
malt
notes
with
a
hint
of
citrusy
hops
taste
features
lemony
hops
and
a
good
dry
lager
taste
theres
a
slightly
bitter
finish
crisp
refreshing
mouthfeel
overall
i
was
not
expecting
the
tastes
that
were
in
this
beer
although
it
is
not
one
i
think
i
would
frequent
it
has
a
relatively
interesting
citrus

sour
flavor
that
make
this

o
this
would
make
a

session
beer
it
is
not
very
complex
but
overall
is
smooth
and
tasty
i
would
have
no
problem
putting
down
a
6pack
of
it
overall
very
well
done
exceptionally
tasty
lager
style
beer
with
some
great
malt
alternatives
to
provide
unique
flavor
and
mouthfeel
o
a
tasty
euro
pale
that
hits
the
flavour
profile
and
satisfies
your
quench
for
thirst
a
worthy
offering
and
would
be
easily
sessionable
on

the
lightmedium
body
has
a
fairly
high
level

feels

overall
this
seems
a
very
drinkable
and
accessible
beer
some
may
say
that
its
boring
especially
with
rogues
reputation
but
boring
doesnt
necessarily
have
to
mean
bad
its
a
simple
yet
welldone
beer
and
i
can
appreciate
it
for
that
would
i
buy
it
again
absolutely
and
have
numerous
times
one
of
my
favourite
american
lagers
o
finish
is
too
cidery
and
the
experience
was
not
enjoyable
not
sure
if
this
taste
is
what
the
brewer
intended
or
the
bottle
is
bad
it
looks
and
smells
good

flavor
with
just
a

of

coming
through
slightly
watery
but

carbonated
overall
i
found
this
beer
rather
unique
it
was
like

nice
carbonated
apple
juice
with
just
a
hint
of
bitterness
overall
i
expected
more
im
not
the
biggest
rogue
fan
but
with
all
the
competitors
out
there
and
rogue
being
one
of
the
bigger
craft
beer
companies
you
would
think
they
would
have
produced
something
better
everything
else
is
pretty
much
just

pretty
good

not

i
thought
id
give
this
beer
a
try
solely
based
on
the
fact
that
its
a
rogue
i
wasnt
disappointed
it
poured
a
pleasant
one
for
all
classic
no
holds
barred
i
actually
thought
this
was
a
pretty
good
beer
nothing
special
poor
belgian
beer
my
first
beer
as
a
teen
living
in
belgium
back
in
the
80s
this
is
what
i
thought
a
beer
tasted
like
its
a
bit
bitter
but
thats
what
made
it
so
memorable
not
to
shabby
but
age
has
made
me
realize
that
its
been
above
average
but
you
dont
talk
bad
about
your
first
kiss
either
its
your
average
pale
lager
with
a
golden
hue
and
a
faint
aroma
it
does
what
you
want
it
to
do
its
like
a
better
tasting
stella
artois
for
the
price
its
definitely
worth
it
o
meehhh
this
is
okay
it
is
drinkable
and
i
suppose
it
is
doing
a
fine
job
for
what
it
is
but
it
just
feels
and
little
dull
to
me
in
short
it
is
nothing
to
write
home
about
the
taste
is
pretty
ordinary
and
on
the
sweet
side
but
not
much
malt
depth
and
lacks
any
real
hop
flavor
pretty
cookie
cutter
lager
flavor
which
is
low
flavor
and
best
enjoyed
chilled
overall
i
didnt
mind
this
it
is
not
metallic
or
grainy
as
some
in
the
style
but
it
does
not
stand
out
either
othis
brew
is
ubiquitous
in
the
old
country
but
that
doesnt
make
it
great
anyway
i
would
rank
jupiler
one
or
two
small
notches
above
a
bmc
macro
aal
type
lager
if
only
for
the
slightly
interesting
smell
and
the
slightly
heavier
mouthfeel
eh
its
okay
its
probably
better
than
a
skunked
stella
though
o
the
beer
is
easy
to
drink
and
tastes
like
an
average
pale
lager
but
without
any
flavors
of
adjunct
malts
d
o
medium
drinkability
cheap
and
nasty
tasting
lager
im
amazed
that
this
is
the
best
selling
beer
in
belgium
and
quite
frankly
it
is
an
awful
lager
the
beer
is
pale
and
golden
yellow
hued
with
a
half
inch
of
white
head
a
nice
appearance
for
the
style
the
aroma
brings
grain
malt
lager
scents
the
flavor
is
of
macro
lager
and
tastes
as
if
it
is
mass
produced
grainy
finish
lingering
bitterness
light
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
this
was
just
ok
overall
the
thing
we
liked
best
about
this
beer
was
the
cooling
aroma
and
the
clean
finish
to
the
beer
the
nose
was
softer
and
less
bitter
than
many
of
its
competitors
and
the
following
taste
was
equally
as
pleasant
for
the
style
throughout
the
tasting
however
things
never
seemed
as
fresh
as
they
could
have
been
the
flavoring
was
there
but
it
was
not
very
robust
deep
or
very
complex
o
easy
drinker
decent
taste
good
as
a
quick
refreshing
beer
as
far
as
i
can
tell
this
is
the
local
substitute
for
budweiser
in
brussels
it
is
the
cheap
fizzy
lager
that
everyone
in
every
cheaper
bar
buys
by
the
caseload
while
watching
whatever
the
most
interesting
sporting
event
is
i
my
opinion
it
is
better
than
budmillercolorsfosters
by
a
small
margin
the
hops
strike
with
a
bit
more
edge
and
the
malts
are
just
as
good
light
yellow
body
with
tons
of
bubbles
this
takes
3rd
place
in
my
personal
line
up
of
macros
behind
viru

nile
special

lager

nothing
that
sets

its

the

as
something

a
stella

dont
believe
those
belgians
who
will
tell
you
how
this
and
stella

are
a
thousand
times
better
than
heineken
or
any
other
dutch
lager
thats
not
true
having
grown
up
in
brussels
on
jupiler
and
the
rest
i
know
the
standards
of
this
beer
can
vary
wildly
if
served
correctly
ice
cold
in
an
immaculately
clean
25cl
glass
and
in
a
bar
full
of
friendly
belgians
jupiler
is
hard
to
beat
i
dont
know
what
their
export
beer
may
taste
like
but
i
think
it
is
a
lager
that
is
balanced
maintains
its
head
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
has
lacing
that
runs
the
length
of
the
glass
balances
bitterness
at
the
end
with
the
sweetness
that
first
hits
your
lips
and
is
really
quite
refreshing
looks
like
lager
should
look
like
served
with
a
twofinger

that
hangs
around
long
enough
as
far
as
commerical

go

wins
hands
down
against
all
the
terrible
commercial
lagers

anywhere

and

european

taste
a
sweet

taste
but
basically
a
standard
lager
a
small
bite
and
medium
to
lighter
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
lightly
dry
aftertaste
i
just
drank
this
on
the
bus
from
brewery
to
brewery
just
so
i
would
not
lose
my
buzz
enjoyed
a
night
full
of
jupiler
in
belgium
a
fair
amount
of
head
sat
atop
the
brew
for
a
short
period
of
time
there
were
not
many
noteworthy
smells
and
the
taste
was
somewhat
bland
yet
pleasant
at
the
same
time
im
not
sure
if
i
would
buy
this
in
a
store
if
i
saw
it
but
i
wouldnt
hesitate
to
order
it
on
tap
in
a
belgian
bar
pale
blonde
with
one
finger
of
white
head

of

up

touches

throughout
mild

there
is
also
a
cardboard
like
taste
that
comes
and
goes
and
was
more
noticeable
towards
the
end
average
feel
for
the
style
med
carbonation
light
body
and
feel
this
isnt
bad
for
what
it
is
its
pretty
close
to
being
stella
or
lowenbrau
or
anything
similar
one
was
ok
on
a
hot
day
sitting
on
a
patio
but
i
will
take
a
pass
on
this
next
time
had
this
on
tap
at
fionn
maccools
waitress
just
said
it
was
called
jupiler
so
im
assuming
it
is
the
standard
one
served
in
a
branded
glass
pours
a
clear
golden
yellow
colour
with
thin
white
head
nice
enough
head
retention
mild
lacing
smells
pretty
clean
some
mild
grassy
hops
and
a
bit
grainy
flavour
has
a
hint
of
bitterness
this
is
a
pretty
nice
lager
on
a
hot
day
on
a
patio
so
it
hit
the
spot
nothing
worth
seeking
out
but
i
enjoyed
it
because
im
drinking
it
from
a
bottle
it
is
difficult
to
say
anything
about
appearance
and
smell
but
the
rest
of
the
features
is
extraordinarily
nice
for
a
cheap
commercial
beer
it
is
worth
stressing
that
it
has
something
from
belgian
ales
sweetness
and
banana
aftertaste
i
will
definitely
buy
a
crate
of
jupiler
the
next
time
instead
of

or

stella

soft

and
goes
down
fast
my
personal
choice
for
a
fun
night
out
so
why
is
so
popular
with
belgians
i
blame
the
advertising
industry
and
inbev
or
whatever
their
name
is
at
the
moment
plus
the
ignorance
of
some
belgians
when
it
comes
to
matters
about
beer
im
sure
that
something
simular
could
be
said
about
the
most
popular
beer
in
your
country
no
matter
what
it
is
they
have
a
lot
of
bad
ones
on
tap
into
a
juliper
glass
at
a
random
bar
in
oostvletern
pours
a
piss
clear

a
white

with
ok
retention
but
nice
sticky
lacing
the
aroma
is
light
grain
and
skunk
not
terrible
but
im
not
happy
either
the
taste
is
light
skunk
really
pretty
boring
a
belgian
bmc
but
about
50
times
better
than
bmc
no
reason
to
ever
drink
though
better
than
your
typical
euro
pale
but
still
unmistakeably
a
euro
pale
best
served
on
tap
d
i
suppose
this
is
average
undrinkability
for
the
style
although
id
probably
reach
for
something
with
less
off
flavours
if
i
want
an
easy
drinking
lager
dnice
and
drinkable
for
sure
but
nothing
really
interesting
going
on
here
i
might
pass
next
time
this
one
was
sent
to
me
via
a
friend
in
belgium
along
with
a
few
other
beers
in
terms
of
what
ive
come
to
expect
from
a
good
belgian
ale
this
one
is
forgettable
pale
gold
color
nose
grain
like
the
mouth
that
tastes
also
cereals
the
smell
is
quite
unique
grain
and
easily
identifiable
the
body
is
light
at
first
but
with
a
mouthtaste
with
a
bitter
taste
characteristic
of
the
jupiler
which
is
not
really
nice
and
comes
quickly
in
the
mouth
you
can
feel
the
finish
of
the
bitterness
of
cereal
a
little
dirty
but
pronounced
notes
seems
like
this
is
one
of
the
macrolike
offerings
in
belgium
not
bad
and
probably
slightly
more
flavor
than
macros
in
the
us
but
if
you
are
in
belgium
there
are
so
many
better
beers
i
got
this
as
a
last
resort
eating
in
a
fast
food
place
because
i
wanted
a
beer
to
go
with
it
and
this
is
what
they
had
the
only
thing
which
is
a
bit
less
is
that
it
gave
me
a
slight
headache
the
next
morning
m
d
overall
this
merits
a
below
average
drinkability
because
it
feels
like
not
much
effort
was
put
into
it
i
didnt
really
know
what
to
expect
when
i
ordered
it
but
i
did
expect
better
purchased
from
the
coke
machine
at
gare
de
midi
in
brussels
for

i
cant
seem
to
find
it
on
beerfly
jupiler
pours
a
light
yellow
with
hints
of
gold
and
a
thin
white
head
that
doesnt
stick
around
the
aroma
is
mostly
grainy
but
there
are
some
floral
hops
in
background
the
flavor
is
light
and
dry
but
there
is
a
pretty
decent
bitterness
and
some
hop
flavor
hiding
in
there
hints
of
honey
linger
in
the
after
taste
when
i
was
in
belgium
at
least
where
we
visited
this
was
the
everyday
beer
if
you
asked
for
a
beer
its
what
you
got
its
certainly
nothing
special
especially
compared
to
the
alternatives
in
the
country
but
i
would
much
prefer
it
to
its
american
equivalents
well
i
guess
i
found
belgiums
answer
to
schlitz
this
beer
was
absolutely
boring
and
tasted
pretty
gross
i
got
a
can
of
it
for
my
train
ride
out
of
brussels
and
i
wasnt
expecting
much
quite
honestly
but
i
figured
that
the
belgians
could
at
least
make
a
cheapo
beer
more
palatable
i
was
wrong
this
was
definitely
a
nogo
i
drank
it
right
from
the
head
so
i
didnt
get
a
really
good
look
at
it
but
it
was
quite
light
from
what
i
could
see
kind
of
a
rank
smell
but
i
think
thats
just
how
it
is
supposed
to
smell
dont
bother
with
this
one
folks
had
this
beer
on
tap
in
the
european
union
area
of
brussels
the
beer
looks
like
a
typical
pilsner
with
a
nice
white
head
the
smell
is
nothing
special
and
the
taste
has
some
strange
malty
sweetness
mixed
with
the
regular
bitterness
that
a
pilsner
should
have
a
decent
beer
for
a
hot
summer
day
where
as
other
people
also
mentioned
any
other
pilsner
would
do
only
i
didnt
like
the
this
type
of
sweetness
in
this
beer
a
typical
beer
to
flush
away
some
food
or
to
drink
on
a
hot
summernight
when
any
cold
pilsener
will
do
worked
pretty
well
as
a
thirst
quencher
or
as
a
womans
beer
notes
i
had
to
try
it
when
in
belgium
but
now
i
will
not
likely
again
got
this
can
at
a
shop
across
from
the
train
station
in
schaerbeek
brussels
belgium
today
i
dont
like
stinky
beer
and
this
one
stinks
literally
like
cabbage
farts
poured
with
a
really
nice
big
foamy
textured
head
and
a
little
lace
pale
clear
gold
color
the
aroma
shows
up
in
the
flavor
too
but
not
as
bad
still
hard
to
get
around
that
cant
believe
this
was
actually
recommended
to
me
at
a
belgian
beer
cafe
its
not
a
terrible
beer
but
just
a
fairly
unremarkable
belgian
lager
some
hop
action
and
body
but
really
i
couldve
got
that
anywhere
excessively
disappointed
because
it
was
recommended
but
tring
not
be
too
harsh
tis
what
it
is
i
would
not
recommend
this
beer
i
had
this
on
tap
at
a
bar
in
amsterdam
which
was
sort
of
criminal
given
the
fine
dutch
and
belgian
ale
choices
elsewhere
in
town
this
looks
smells
and
tastes
like
miller
to
me
which
is
objectionable
budweiser
is
at
least
2x
better
than
this
youll
see
it
available
everywhere
in
belgium
or
the
netherlands
i
recommend
a
pass
dont
spend
to
much
on
a
bottle
of
this
but
if
you
ever
make
it
to
belgium
give
it
a
shot
a
highly
drinkable
beer
and
quaffable
for
sure
but
not
much
here
got
a
tiny
25
cl
can
of
this
from
some
belgian
friends
who
came
and
visited
not
really
my
thing
to
be
honest
but
its
the
thought
that
counts
its
basically
your
standard
euro
lager
with
maybe
a
little
less
skunkiness
in
the
odor
and
flavor
than
most
and
a
little
spiciness
in
terms
of
the
malt
especially
in
the
nose
mediocre
if
a
little
above
average
for
the
style
and
you
could
drink
a
bunch
of
them
if
in
need
drinkability
pretty
good
a
refreshing
if
flawed
and
unremarkable
light
lager
overall
refreshing
and
crisp
lager
enjoyable
quenching
beer
for
a
hot
day
quite
mediocre
for
a
belgian
beer
standard
look
and
taste
nothing
special
here
a
sour
edge
when
it
first
hits
the
mouth
but
finishes
nicely
bought
this
while
travelling
on
business
in
the
southern
netherlands
there
are
much
much
better
local
choices
here
i
like
to
call
this
a
drinking
game
beer
review
translated
from
french
612008
i
had
this
on
tap
in
gent
and
it
was
very
good
its
a
nice
change
from
the
stronger
tastier
belgian
beers
not
a
bad
beer
for
what
it
is
consumed
in
mass
quantities
by
the
belgian
proletariat
it
quenches
the
thirst
and
helps
to
wash
down
some
of
that
hearty
belgian
food
at
the
same
time
if
you
are
in
belgium
there
are
far
better
beers
to
be
had
go
out
and
try
em
instead
of
just
going
around
the
corner
to
the
local
bar
or
convenience
store
and
getting
this
my
impression
of
this
beer
is
that
it
is
the
budweiser
of
belgium
every
crappy
bar
in
belgium
has
a
juplier
sign
out
front
i
eventually
gave
in
and
had
one
in
amsterdam
though
just
to
see
how
it
was
it
has
a
very
light
crystal
clear
amber
body
with
a
pure
white
head
so
far
the
bud
comparison
holds
true
the
taste
is
where
they
differ
it
has
a
light
malty
body
with
slight
hop
bitterness
the
nice
thing
about
this
beer
versus
bud
is
that
you
can
actually
taste
the
malt
profile
even
if
it
isnt
the
best
beer
flavor
ive
tasted
the
body
is
as
light
as
a
bud
would
be
but
it
has
slightly
better
drinkability
crap
crap
crap
drinkability
easy
to
drink
because
its
boring
drinkable
but
for
sure
not
a
beer
to
search
for
this
stuff
is
really
excellent
drinking
beer
nothing
outstanding
no
noteably
unique
traits
just
wellmade
beer
and
very
drinkable
final
thought
this
is
a
major
disspointment
to
come
from
the
country
known
for
its
beer
luckily
it
wasnt
a
typcial
belgian
ale
but
a
cheap
budlike
lager
pale
yellow
with
brilliant
clarity
and
a
dense
but
slightly
rocky
white
head
quickly
reduces
to
a
small
ring
but
produces
some
nice
lacing
noble
hop
aroma
with
a
marshmallow
sweetness
in
the
flavour
and
aroma
light
yeasty
character
and
mild
bitterness
balanced
towards
sweetness
finishes
on
the
dry
side
with
some
hop
character
light
body
and
high
carbonation
starts
with
crisp
co2
then
becomes
moderately
creamy
this
beer
is
light
and
simple
fine
for
sitting
on
the
patio
in
the
summer
but
nothing
special
taste
is
like
nose
was
being
oxidated
empty
creamy
and
aftertaste
is
litle
sweetbitter
lack
of
taste
and
lots
of
off
tastes
make
this
brew
unenjoyable
overall
not
too
bad
i
would
have
this
over
stella
tennants
harp
etc
pretty
averagecrap
macro
lager
it
pours
a
light
golden
colour
with
abundant
carbonation
and
a
negligible
head
the
nose
is
dominated
by
waterbiscuity
to
light
cider
kind
of
sourness
while
on
palate
its
refreshingly
malty
with
limepeel
kind
of
hoppy
bitterness
and
finished
with
exactly
the
same
taste
the
body
is
extremely
light
against
its
strength5
2abv
and
overall
the
mouthfeel
and
structure
is
at
best
mediocre
i
cant
quite
grasp
the
fact
so
its
claimed
in
the
beer
catalogue
for
wetherspoons
may
beerfestival
that
its
the
most
popular
lager
in
belgium
surely
the
belgians
know
much
better
and
deserve
better
even
interbrews
stella
artois
is
less
boring
than
this
lager

jeff
pours
ok
clear
blonde
color
with
a
1
inch
head
although
it
is
highly
carbonated
foam
quickly
disappears
smell
is
of
some
grain
and
alcohol
not
much
taste
to
speak
of
obviously
meant
to
be
light
and
refreshing
like
water
on
a
hot
day
overall
a
pretty
basic
brew
comparable
toaother
macros
here
i
do
like
the
crest
on
the
label
a
bull
doing
his
best
karate
kid
stance
the
smell
isnt
very
good
but
still
not
as
offensive
as
some
others
in
this
style
the
taste
follows
that
up
in
a
similar
manner
hops
come
through
in
the
wrong
sort
of
way
and
its
definitely
too
sharp
in
the
mouth
not
bad
i
had
this
one
on
tap
at
a
karaoke
bar
in
brussels
i
was
already
drunk
out
of
my
mind
and
this
was
all
they
had
on
tap
so
we
went
for
it
its
a
dark
golden
colour
with
an
offwhite
head
the
aromas
are
simple
and
consist
of
light
hops
light
malts
and
a
bit
of
grapiness
the
taste
is
a
bit
fruity
dry
and
stellalike
the
drinkability
is
good
as
the
mouthfeel
is
very
light
and
refreshing
pour
is
translucid
golden
tone
no
carbonation
except
for
an
easyfadeoff
medium
head
smell
is
a
bit
strong
malty
and
hoppy
taste
is
full
with
a
nice
comfy
body
a
bit
extra
bitterness
at
the
end
a
simply
awful
diuretic
that
degrades
belgium
beer
nuff
said
cheers
from
cyprus
this
seemed
to
be
the
swill
of
brussels
beer
for
the
masses
though
few
real
cafes
carried
it
had
this
several
times
in
belgium
it
was
commonly
served
in
small
ridged
glasses
which
would
raise
the
fingers
from
the
glass
surface
and
keep
the
beer
cooler
for
longer
not
a
bad
brew
refreshing
notes
not
too
bad
not
fantastic
either
but
we
would
definitely
not
dump
this
beatiful
bottle
taste
like
mahou
or
even
worse
xd
underrated
this
has
all
the
traits
of
a
baltic
region
lager
super
cold
fermented
feeling
patient
beer
fuller
bodied
well
carbonated
and
drinkable
forever
maybe
some
reviewers
have
had
dated
bottles
but
when
fresh
this
is
really
nice
not
a
trace
of
off
flavors
for
a
pale
lager
type
and
pretty
clean
finishing
despite
all
the
body
fun
beer
awesome
bottle
obviously
aside
from
the
fact
it
only
hold
10
or
so
ounces
of
beer
feeling
a
little
cheated
there
but
the
beer
tastes
fresh
to
me
cleanses
the
palate
but
still
has
flavor
and
i
think
its
my
first
beer
from
the
land
of
estonia
so
thats
always
fun
not
sure
i
would
buy
it
again
but
in
a
restaurant
context
of
macro
brews
its
a
fun
bottle
to
drink
definitely
a
league
above
most
of
its
peers
general
una

y
muy
sencilla
de
tomar
pours
a
light
golden
color
with
a
thin
lace
of
head
not
much
aroma
in
this
but
is
slightly
sweet
goes
down
smooth
with
moderate
carbonation
taste
is
slightly
bitter
and
sweet
with
hints
of
carmel
malts
not
sure
what
to
think
overall
at
first
it
tasted
good
but
the
sips
i
take
the
more
it
tastes
like
an
adjunct
lager
so
im
torn
serving
type
bottle
overall
very
drinkable
and
aside
from
the
aroma
completely
inoffensive
o
basic
euro
lager
a
premium
estonian
beer
thank
goodness
its
premium
cause
i
dont
what
to
try
anything
otherwise
bleh
a
decidedly
subpar
lager
looks
pretty
average
while
the
aroma
and
flavour
are
faint
and
beset
with
offnotes
that
detract
from
the
experience
lacklustre
body
no
great
shakes
bland
and
unsatisfying
do
yourself
a
favour
and
give
it
a
miss
overall
there
is
an
overwhelming
egg
aroma
and
taste
that
ruins
this
brew
i
stumbled
upon
this
lithuanian
beer
at
roosevelt
at
7
mcallen
texas
one
should
note
that
the
water
in
this
beer
is
from
one
of
the
deepest
wells
in
all
of
europe
it
pours
crystal
clear
yellow
little
head
and
average
carbonation
it
tastes
like
well
water
with
hints
of
malt
corn
honey
and
a
sweetness
it
has
a
metallic
aftertaste
and
is
not
filling
it
comes
in
a
unique
bottle
it
is
a
refreshing
drink
but
with
a
little
more
intense
than
expected
bitterness
besides
the
wonderful
bottle
design
the
content
is
poor
i
think
it
is
better
to
take
it
very
cold
to
not
notice
the
flaws
the
taste
reminds
me
a
lot
of
corona
or
budweiser
nothing
special
a
novelty
sort
of
thing
is
all
this
is
the
bottles
neat
but
the
beer
may
honestly
be
worse
than
bud
light
in
my
opinion
bud
light
somehow
has
more
flavor
this
seriously
might
be
the
first
time
an
adjunct
lager
sort
of
beer
has
actually
let
me
down
i
wish
i
waited
a
couple
days
to
review
this
beer
for
april
fools
day
because
this
beer
is
a
joke
the
taste
is
light
sweet
and
watery
no
real
bitterness
present
not
even
in
the
finish
too
bad
still
drinkable
but
no
real
taste
to
it
poured
into
a
dogfish
head
pint
glass
pours
a
light
straw
yellow
with
a
thin
film
of
white
foam
with
decent
retention
typical
adjunct
aroma
of
sweet
malt
grain
and
faint
hops
flavor
is
light
biscuit
malt
with
a
slightly
harsh
grain
grassy
hops
faint
apple
juice
light
bodied
with
active
carbonation
a
decent
pale
lager
with
a
little
more
flavor
and
hops
than
most
adjunct
ales
but
also
a
little
less
smooth
and
sweet
a
satisfactory
light
lager
for
drinking
with
lunch
but
fairly
average
cool
bottle
pours
to
a
thin
white
head
and
moderate
lacing
color
is
pale
gold
aroma
is
grainy
bready
and
slightly
sour
with
a
very
faint
hint
of
spicy
noble
hops
flavor
is
typical
for
the
style
clean
crisp
grainy
balanced
with
noble
hops
and
light
dry
finish
light
mouthfeel
with
co2
appropriate
for
the
style
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
for
the
style
not
too
weird
or
offensive
but
not
very
remarkable
either
i
dont
know
why
it
is
getting
such
bad
reviews
it
is
not
bad
at
all
the
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
it
slides
over
the
tongue
easily
enough
viru
25
cheap
tasting
pale
lager
that
is
exactly
what
i
had
expected
going
in
the
beer
is
inoffensive
and
fairly
easy
to
drink
although
there
is
touches
of
grain
and
some
skunk
that
are
slightly
offputting
when
taking
the
price
into
account
id
rather
just
have
a
kokanee
than
this
o
this
is
an
easy
drinking
reasonably
smooth
beer
to
drink
but
it
just
doesnt
deliver
overall
it
is
still
a
cheap
euro
lager
that
while
it
does
have
a
richer
malt
profile
it
is
still
full
of
adjunct
blahness
i
dont
think
id
go
out
of
my
way
to
buy
this
one
again
but
wont
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
is
shouldnt
be
tried
by
anybody
just
not
the
beer
that
the
good
people
at
viru
say
it
is
thats
all
a
perfect
lady
beer
for
a
beer
garden
for
ladies
who
dont
really
like
beer
it
is
inoffensive
throughout
but
also
just
fail
to
impress
on
any
level
easy
to
drinik
and
thirst
quenching
though
uninteresting
there
is
nothing
offensive
here
and
it
did
add
to
an
enjoyable
afternoon
with
friends
o
not
an
impressive
beer
but
im
finally
tasting
an
industrial
pale
lager
that
feels
natural
highly
drinkable
and
refreshing
it
brings
exactly
what
you
would
expect
from
the
style
tried
this
one
in
naples
italy
pours
a
clear
yellow
with
a
small
white
head
aroma
is
malty
cardboard
with
some
grain
taste
is
also
sweet
malty
with
some
grain
leading
to
an
ultra
lightly
bitter
but
dry
finish
from
the
saaz
hops
pretty
ordinary
and
inoffensive
but
a
great
octahedral
bottle
o
overall
this
is
quite
the
subpar
beer
i
would
rather
drink
an
american
macro
than
another
one
of
these
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
very
very
gulpable
lager
cool
bottle
but
thats
about
it
i
doubt
id
bother
with
this
one
again
overall
this
is
a
betterthanaverage
offering
and
pretty
good
if
it
actually
is
an
adjunct
lager
o
this
is
just
another
bland
euro
lager
that
just
happens
to
come
in
a
coollooking
bottle
edit
this
one
actually
improved
when
served
at
what
i
would
consider
too
warm
for
the
style
as
such
ive
edited
my
ratings
a
bit
my
beer
rating
1
5
o
estonia
checkmark
is
the
sole
reason
to
visit
this
beer
very
light
and
drinkable
but
unenjoyable
for
me
and
i
will
not
be
buying
or
drinking
this
again
when
my
4
pack
is
gone
2
5
overall
what
a
disaster
about
4
ounces
was
more
than
enough
yep
pretty
appalling
brew
this
one
very
artificial
tasting
thin
weak
and
unpleasant
overall
not
a
good
first
impression
from
estonia
i
was
expecting
more
from
this
country
o
this
was
one
of
the
strangest
beers
ive
ever
had
and
not
a
very
good
one
overall
let
it
warm
up
and
it
blooms
i
loved
it
10
ounce
bottle
date
on
bottle
cap
of
07
10
10
the
bottle
was
stored
in
the
cooler
at
the
party
source
but
im
pretty
sure
its
nowhere
close
to
being
fresh
at
this
point
served
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
gold
color
with
a
half
inch
white
head
the
head
went
away
quickly
and
there
isnt
much
lacing
either
aroma
is
sweet
and
bready
malt
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
but
theres
also
a
weird
bitter
taste
that
i
dont
care
for
mouthfeelbody
is
light
and
its
a
bit
slick
its
also
smooth
and
goes
down
easy
for
the
style
its
not
a
bad
brew
worth
a
try
if
you
can
get
a
single
bottle
of
it
like
i
did
i
might
have
to
try
a
fresher
bottle
of
this
in
the
future
like
many
i
picked
this
up
due
to
its
bottle
in
louisiana
it
completely
stands
out
and
i
just
had
to
have
it
it
poured
light
gold
very
highly
carbonated
and
had
a
strong
hissing
with
lots
of
bubbles
the
head
dissipated
fairly
quickly
the
first
sip
is
by
far
the
best
for
this
beer
at
first
on
the
front
its
very
malty
and
tasty
after
that
it
flattens
out
considerably
and
becomes
very
average
i
wouldnt
buy
it
again
at
the
price
but
the
bottle
still
is
cool
overall
drinkability
first
of
all
i
dont
think
this
is
an
adjunct
lager
it
has
aspects
of
one
but
its
very
different
and
the
website
for
the
brewer
doesnt
claim
to
have
adjuncts
present
so
maybe
this
is
a
euro
pale
lager
anyway
its
pretty
good
overall
very
drinkable
i
could
easily
have
another
one
or
two
of
these
especially
with
the
smaller
bottle
size
i
originally
picked
it
up
just
for
the
weird
bottle
but
now
that
ive
had
it
im
very
glad
i
did
have
it
and
ill
have
to
get
it
again
a
bit
pricy
since
its
coming
all
the
way
from
estonia
but
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
i
was
expecting
worse
due
to
the
reviews
but
no
its
not
that
bad
at
all
and
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
frosty
golden
liquid
with
a
finger
of
head
that
goes
right
away
smells
very
bready
also
some
banana
corn
and
very
faint
citrus
tastes
like
crisp
vegetables
with
sweet
fruit
for
an
adjunct
lager
this
stuff
is
really
really
good
id
drink
it
all
the
time
if
i
lived
in
estonia
i
originally
bought
this
because
it
had
an
awesome
bottle
and
it
was
fairly
cheap
but
after
cracking
it
open
i
found
it
to
be
a
surprisingly
pleasant
experience
i
wouldnt
rush
back
for
more
but
i
would
definitely
come
back
at
some
point
good
summer
day
beer
fans
of
bohemian
pilsners
and
german
maibocks
may
want
to
give
this
beer
a
shot
robust
for
a
lager
and
surprisingly
flavorful
and
textured
for
any
beer
that
includes
adjunct
grains
dthis
is
probably
one
of
the
best
adjunct
lagers
ive
had
to
be
honest
it
goes
down
so
easily
i
honestly
feel
that
bmc
drinkers
would
prefer
this
to
well
bmc
my
glass
disappeared
quickly
close
to
two
finger
head
of
bone
white
and
delicate
microfoam
hard
to
even
see
the
contour
of
most
of
the
bubbles
retention
is
slight
at
best
simmers
down
swiftly
lacing
fares
about
the
same
some
immediate
stick
then
gone
clear
golden
straw
color
to
the
liquid
pale
yet
attractive
only
sparse
bubbles
visible
not
much
difference
towards
the
rims
noticeably
sweet
nose
of
corn
syrup
honey
cane
sugar
and
potato
bread
waft
of
orange
citrus
rice
and
mixed
grain
no
real
herbaceous
character
highly
innocuous
mediumbodied
good
solid
bottom
keeps
it
anchored
in
the
palate
remains
on
the
sweet
side
here
too
with
that
corn
and
other
adjuncts
honey
and
caramel
the
orange
citrus
pulp
and
sweet
notes
of
standard
peach
and
apricot
fruit
moderate
hay
meadow
grasses
once
more
avoids
any
really
herbal
bite
or
overall
bitterness
the
carbonation
is
light
but
tight
enough
to
help
it
finish
with
elevating
dryness
nothing
really
noteworthy
does
have
high
drinkability
and
general
smoothness
rjt
overall
really
mediocre
but
it
is
refreshing
the
bottle
alone
is
a
reason
to
get
this
but
it
is
like
any
other
adjunct
lager
d
with
this
beer
not
being
full
of
off
flavors
like
a
lot
of
adjunct
lagers
it
makes
it
very
drinkable
refreshing
well
that
might
be
pushing
it
although
i
really
did
like
this
beer
for
what
it
was
i
wouldnt
drink
a
sixer
although
if
it
were
hot
outside
i
think
i
might
they
did
go
all
out
with
a
cool
bottle
all
in
all
as
far
as
amer
adj
lagers
go
this
one
is
really
not
all
that
bad
seems
a
bit
cleaner
than
many
not
a
beer
id
really
crave
and
its
not
exactly
cheap
but
its
certainly
not
the
worst
and
by
far
the
best
estonian
brew
ive
had
d
perfectly
inoffensive
and
easy
to
down
theres
nothing
here
that
makes
this
beer
stand
out
from
the
crowd
which
might
be
the
point
as
neat
as
the
bottles
is
the
beer
runs
in
entirely
the
opposite
direction
bland
inoffensive
i
suppose
and
just
not
worth
the
novelty
d
its
fairly
refreshing
although
some
hop
bitterness
would
make
it
an
easy
summer
thirst
quencher
not
offensive
just
not
real
good
really
just
bought
it
for
the
kickass
bottle
which
the
girlfriend
wants
to
use
as
a
vase
at
two
bucks
the
beer
that
rare
estonia
tick
seemed
like
a
bonus
what
it
is
missing
in
complex
nuances
it
makes
up
for
it
by
being
really
refreshing
still
a
nofrills
lager
300
ml
bottle
very
clean
and
pale
yellow
colour
with
a
head
that
doesnt
hold
the
only
remarkabler
thing
about
the
smell
is
that
it
makes
you
think
it
has
more
alcohol
than
it
has
besides
that
just
grain
and
hops
light
body
i
think
i
find
some
apple
in
mouth
but
nothing
more
normal
dull
beer
but
it
comes
in
a
nice
bottle
d
the
aroma
was
stronger
than
the
taste
but
there
is
realy
nothing
to
either
of
them
good
or
bad
it
was
a
bit
like
drinking
carbonated
water
d
well
its
refreshing
because
its
very
watery
but
it
does
not
worth
the
price
paid
in
switzerland
since
you
can
have
a
budvar
of
urquell
by
the
same
price
in
the
same
supermarket
overall
decent
pilsner
fairly
balanced
it
is
very
light
and
loses
flavor
toward
the
end
of
the
bottle
at
least
it
comes
in
an
interesting
bottle
tasted
from
10oz
bottle
purchased
at
binnys
hyde
park
pours
pale
yellow
with
a
fizzy
and
shortlived
head
nose
is
pale
malt
with
a
just
a
hint
of
hops
banana
and
yeast
the
nose
is
rather
subdued
the
flavors
are
even
more
subdued
with
just
a
little
bit
of
malt
and
hops
the
body
is
light
and
watery
with
very
little
carbonation
this
is
not
a
very
good
beer
if
it
wasnt
for
the
distinctive
tall
octahedral
bottle
viru
probably
wouldnt
have
found
its
way
into
my
cart
if
thats
what
it
takes
to
sell
more
beer
more
power
to
the
brewery
bottom
line
too
bad
the
contents
of
the
bottle
dont
match
the
distinctiveness
of
the
bottle
itself
decent
summer
quenched
and
the
shape
of
the
bottle
might
draw
you
in
d
easy
to
drink
just
like
the
style
suggests
but
would
be
easier
to
drink
if
it
tasted
better
d
here
is
the
shining
positive
aspect
of
this
beer
highly
drinkable
as
a
liquid
but
not
especially
tasty
if
for
some
reason
i
decided
to
drink
a
large
volume
of
tame
beer
i
would
choose
this
over
any
of
the
american
light
lagers
if
only
because
it
would
look
decidedly
badass
to
have
ten
or
fifteen
of
these
weird
bottles
laying
around
my
apartment
the
next
day
when
i
woke
up
d
cool
bottle
but
the
bottle
is
better
than
the
beer
this
is
your
basic
american
lager
but
without
the
distinct
flavor
that
many
others
can
achieve
crisp
and
refreshing
low
on
flavor
thin
but
balanced
a
little
sweet
medium
malts
like
every
single
other
blah
eurolager
the
bottle
is
still
strong
i
admit
it
i
picked
this
beer
up
because
of
the
unique
bottle
that
being
said
it
pours
a
clear
jaundice
topped
by
a
cute
finger
of
bright
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
light
wheat
light
corn
syrup
and
miscellaneous
vegetable
matter
kinda
like
sniffing
a
used
insink
disposal
after
cleaning
a
salad
bowl
the
taste
does
away
with
the
veggies
thankfully
leaving
some
watereddown
corn
syrup
wheat
rice
and
a
slightly
metallic
wannabebitterness
the
body
is
light
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
fairly
crisp
finish
ive
had
many
better
from
this
particular
baltic
state
nice
bottle
though
this
one
really
isnt
undrinkable
and
it
went
pretty
well
with
the
pasta
salad
and
spinach
cake
i
was
eating
on
a
hot
afternoon
i
was
searching
for
carolina
beers
at
chips
wine
and
beer
in
kill
devil
hills
nc
and
found
this
i
figured
id
never
has
estonian
beer
and
gave
it
a
shot
its
basically
just
another
clean
continental
lager
the
aroma
has
very
mild
vegetable
offnotes
but
otherwise
its
a
simple
and
refreshing
beer
its
no
big
surprise
but
estonians
can
make
a
macro
lager
as
well
as
any
one
else
notes
pretty
much
a
typical
mass
produced
easy
to
drink
low
on
flavor
kind
of
beer
just
in
a
neat
looking
bottle
and
from
estonia
had
a
slightly
off
and
metallic
taste
that
wasnt
necessarily
good
or
bad
just
different
not
really
worth
seeking
out
unless
you
want
to
try
a
beer
from
estonia
or
want
the
bottle
this
is
pretty
bad
not
worth
looking
at
buying
or
drinking
try
again
estonia
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
white
sodalike
head
that
dissipated
really
quickly
the
nose
is
mostly
absent
but
there
is
a
faint
grainy
buttery
character
way
back
there
somewhere
theres
not
much
in
the
way
of
flavorthats
probably
the
pointbut
there
is
a
subtle
hint
of
haylike
malt
in
the
center
just
past
the
subtle
hint
of
sweetness
at
the
front
it
doesnt
have
much
body
it
drinks
like
water
surprisingly
this
comes
in
a
10oz
bottle
one
could
drink
gallons
of
this
without
any
trouble
drinkable
heck
yeah
interesting
heck
no
overall
a
forgettable
beer
for
bottle
collectors
there
are
good
baltic
lagers
but
this
isnt
one
rather
than
make
a
bad
beer
they
seem
to
have
decided
to
make
a
completely
insubstantial
one
more
drinkable
i
guess
but
why
would
you
the
best
thing
about
this
beer
by
far
is
the
bottle
there
isnt
anything
really
bad
about
the
beer
unless
by
bad
youd
mean
without
any
character
there
are
no
foul
characteristics
but
theres
not
much
flavor
aroma
or
palate
the
head
is
white
and
almost
disappears
quickly
with
no
head
color
is
a
clear
yellow
aroma
is
faint
world
beer
flavor
is
the
same
body
isnt
totally
gone
but
there
isnt
much
hardly
any
finish
forgettable
except
for
the
cool
bottle
strange
bottle
looks
like
something
my
grandmother
would
keep
oil
or
flowers
in
first
beer
ive
had
from
estonia
pours
a
very
light
pale
yellow
with
very
little
head
that
is
gone
quickly
smells
like
any
other
commercial
light
beer
very
light
grains
nothing
special
about
the
flavor
of
this
one
typical
for
this
style
not
much
here
very
light
body
with
no
residual
flavors
to
be
talked
about
could
pound
these
all
day
by
the
pool
and
get
extremely
bloated
and
unsatisfied
the
bottle
sure
is
cool
though
overall
both
the
mouthfeel
and
flavor
are
quite
flat
a
touch
of
bitterness
on
the
finish
but
not
a
lot
going
on
here
in
terms
of
flavor
after
seeing
this
beer
in
the
local
supermarket
i
bought
it
solely
for
the
unique
eightsided
slender
bottle
the
beer
itself
is
a
clear
golden
color
initially
it
presents
a
bright
fizzy
head
but
this
is
extremely
shortlived
and
the
beer
quickly
retreats
to
flatness
the
aroma
is
of
a
little
malt
and
distant
grains
not
much
to
impress
the
taste
is
similar
with
a
sharp
carbonic
bite
and
a
little
metallic
tinness
light
and
uninteresting
the
bottle
is
neat
but
the
beer
inside
is
completely
forgettable
bought
this
because
of
the
beauty
of
the
distinctive
octahedral
bottle
and
to
be
honest
the
bottle
is
about
the
only
thing
impressive
about
this
brew
smells
like
a
dried
out
toast
bread
actually
not
far
from
the
flavors
which
develop
on
the
tongue
the
mouthfeel
is
unpleasant
and
comes
with
a
metallic
and
adstringent
aftertaste
again
the
bottle
is
a
classic
at
least
a
quite
beautiful
bottle
not
a
beer
ill
be
having
again
only
bought
it
because
of
the
bottle
shape
conned
again
ill
never
learn
other
comments
interesting
bottle
bad
name
boring
beer
a
old
favorite
revisited
taste
better
this
time
the
fun
starts
here
or
it
doesnt
d
by
far
my
favorite
beer
overall
a
pretty
average
macro
lager
if
im
looking
for
a
cheap
lager
i
would
rather
get
a
case
of
oettinger
for
31
a
case
which
is
also
a
better
beer
rather
than
a
case
of
this
for
au45
i
am
neutral
on
this
beer
this
is
a
crisp
malty
danish
beer
i
havent
tried
anything
like
it
in
the
united
states
the
danish
version
tastes
much
better
than
the
tuborg
pilsners
produced
in
other
countries
e
g
italy
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
ever
had
ice
cold
or
room
temperature
they
taste
great
either
way
overall
tuborg
green
is
not
a
terribly
bad
euro
pale
lager
its
just
more
muted
and
less
offensive
than
many
but
also
lacks
the
boldness
and
tastiness
that
some
of
them
due
have
basically
akin
to
the
flavor
this
is
a
muted
representative
of
the
style
thats
fine
after
a
hard
days
work
or
some
yard
work
but
definitey
wont
blow
anyones
socks
off
not
entirely
bad
but
also
not
really
pleasant
lager
ill
pass
a
slightly
better
option
to
the
american
macrolagers
purchsed
in
oslo
norway
in
august
2012
consumed
march
2013

pack
was
like

so
lugged

and
rim

smell
is
skunky
fruity
heinekenlike
taste
is
a
bit
fruitier
than
most
of
the
style
but
its
not
bad
at
all
nice
euro
lager
flavor
sweet
slight
hops
but
honestly
its
pretty
good
maybe
its
the
slight
age
and
transport
in
a
suit
case
but
its
pretty
good
as
a
general
rule
its
a
good
idea
to
stay
away
from
all
the
tuborg
products
available
in
india
the
sweet
malt
liquors
and
lagers
available
here
in
their
hopless
sweetness
have
a
kind
of
charm
this
one
fails
even
to
deliver
on
that
level
if
you
must
drink
something
and
this
is
your
only
option
you
still
might
pause
and
ask
yourself
just
how
thirsty
you
are
before
trying
it
not
impressed
piss
not
a
good
lager
the
initial
aromaflavour
seemed
vaguely
acceptable
with
a
hint
of
noble
hops
however
everything
went
downhill
fast
once
it
began
to
warm
up
bland
and
boring
with
disgusting
offnotes
best
avoided
unless
ice
cold
not
as
bad
as
folks
are
making
it
out
to
be
pours
bright
yellow
with
an
average
white
head
smells
like
a
boring
euro
brew
old
malts
and
some
run
of
the
mill
yeast
flavor
is
surprisingly
good
its
crisp
with
some
hops
throughout
and
the
malts
arent
as
rotten
as
the
smell
suggests
it
leaves
a
bit
of
a
gross
aftertaste
but
it
is
down
easy
and
nice
and
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
feel
is
good
its
bubbly
and
light
i
can
drink
a
whole
lot
of
these
in
a
sitting
not
a
good
beer
but
in
a
market
saturated
with
bad
beer
it
stands
out
to
me
finish
is
not
profound
a
kind
of
apple
sourness
pervades
and
its
not
terribly
memorable
not
one
to
seek
out
fits
into
the
style
of
massproduced
golden
lager
without
doing
much
to
draw
any
good
attention
to
itself
d
other
than
the
wild
bouquet
of
aromas
this
brew
went
through
it
was
pretty
much
the
same
old
same
old
i
was
hoping
this
brew
would
be
something
like
its
danish
counterpart
carlsberg
but
it
didnt
really
deliver
the
same
delicious
profile
of
that
an
unoffensive
lawnmower
beer
at
worst
in
exchange
for
this
swill
being
forever
banished
from
the
shelves
of
the
lcbo
i
am
prepared
to
sacrifice
myself
in
favor
of
my
fellow
beer
drinkers
in
ontario
i
am
prepared
to
be
defenestrated
at
the
lcbo
head
quarters
if
that
helps
in
fact
despite
my
profound
apathy
towards
most
anything
i
feel
compelled
to
write
a
letter
to
the
lcbo
to
vent
although
i
will
point
out
the
good
brews
they
have
gotten
right
lately
fullers
and
garrison
series
in
order
to
avoid
seeming
like
a
complete
whack
job
about
this
shit
enough
is
enough
tuborg
green
is
no
better
or
worse
really
than
tuborg
gold
colour
me
shocked
this
brewery
may
release
cans
in
all
sorts
of
shades
but
they
really
only
make
one
kind
of
beer
bland
borderline
offputting
swill
tuborg
may
be
one
of
the
oldest
european
breweries
to
offer
pale
lagers
but
that
doesnt
mean
they
even
approach
being
the
best
at
it
easy
to
drink
easy
to
forget
o
drink
this
as
cold
as
possible
and
it
will
feel
like
a
decent
and
refreshingly
easy
beer
d
i
was
done
after
one
too
sour
and
tart
no
flavor
bad
aftertaste
decidedly
average
in
almost
every
respect
i
would
never
turn
this
down
as
its
quite
inoffensive
and
mildly
refreshing
but
there
are
other
epls
that
are
both
easier
to
find
and
better
if
you
like
tuborg
grøn
i
would
not
recommend
drinking
those
bought
in
norway
overall
this
beer
isnt
spectacular
but
it
also
isnt
offensive
in
any
way
i
wouldnt
rush
out
to
buy
it
again
but
its
very
drinkable
the
slight
sweetness
make
it
stand
out
a
little
bit
from
the
hundreds
of
other
beers
in
its
class
got
a
gigantic
mug
of
this
in
rome
basically
i
was
sick
of
red
wine
was
pale
yellow
with
little
head
no
prominent
aromas
to
speak
of
save
for
a
whiff
of
hops
flavor
was
mostly
like
a
watered
down
europils
light
bitter
and
some
hops
was
good
softness
to
it
but
as
drinkable
as
it
was
so
is
water
when
youre
thirsty
its
good
when
youre
desperate
for
a
beer
drinkability
decent
if
you
like
this
kind
of
beer
overall
an
unimpressive
generic
euro
lager
no
features
that
are
worth
bragging
about
no
reason
to
drink
this
httpabarwithnoname
wordpress
com
not
nearly
the
skanky
mess
that
is
its
gold
sibling
which
may
have
everything
to
do
with
the
can
vs
green
bottle
deal
still
a
substandard
eurolager
and
not
a
pilsener
as
proclaimed
on
the
label
not
something
i
would
be
happy
to
see
available
at
venuepricing
levels
given
that
sporting
event
sponsorhappy
carlsberg
is
the
ultimate
owner
of
this
pseudoswill
drinkability
hey
its
cheap
innit
pours
a
pale
straw
colour
with
head
that
seems
to
stick
around
longer
than
i
expected
very
small
amount
of
lacing
smells
a
little
bit
grassy
with
some
grains
but
mostly
faint
flavour
is
slightly
sweet
nothing
off
about
this
carbonation
is
nice
for
the
style
i
actually
prefer
this
to
the
gold
by
quite
a
bit
d
drinkable
yes
but
medicinal
hop
taste
is
slightly
offputting
d
this
is
an
okay
lager
id
like
to
try
it
out
of
something
other
than
a
green
bottle
nothing
worth
trying
here
i
can
only
imagine
how
skunked
a
green
bottle
of
the
stuff
would
taste
i
wouldnt
go
looking
for
this
beer
if
i
was
you
overall
this
beer
is
nothing
special
at
all
dont
look
to
find
or
drink
on
a
positive
note
i
drank
this
at
the
same
time
as
a
carlsberg
and
this
blows
it
out
of
the
water
but
i
rated
carlsberg
an
f
so
its
not
saying
much
overall
this
certainly
wasnt
a
terrible
beer
but
its
not
worth
seeking
out
a
step
up
from
bmc
in
the
states
but
not
by
much
d
i
can
expect
only
so
much
out
of
this
style
so
when
enjoying
something
like
football
on
a
summer
afternoon
im
content
with
something
about
as
pedestrian
as
the
actual
activity
it
also
wasnt
entirely
offputting

the
potential

not

else
to

i

on

was
a

this
beer
comes
across
as
a
typical
middle
of
the
road
danish
beer
that
does
not
offend
well
then
heres
a
big
pass
here
makes
me
question
what
additives
managed
to
make
their
way
in
here
to
give
off
this
sort
of
result
its
crisp
ill
give
it
that
however
i
question
whether
this
was
attained
through
natural
methods
the
burning
sensation
still
hasnt
gone
away
either
d
this
is
very
easy
to
dring
but
it
doesnt
stand
out
at
all
pours
a
rather
pale
straw
body
with
plenty
of
carbonation
produces
a
bright
white

that
disappears
quickly
leaving
only
a
ring
of
residue
clinging
to
the
glass
and
body
aroma
is
lacking
smells
slightly
like
wet

taste
is
almost
nonexistent
slight
bitterness
there
is
a

what

although
thats
followed
by
a
strange
metallic
flavour

few
mouthfuls
feel
quite
full
and
fizzy
followed
by
a
cleansing
dryness
on
the

to
wear
off
in

quickly

beer

youre

from

dull
yellow
colour
with
a
1
finger
head
that
vanished
by
the
time
the
first
glug
was
over
smell
was
nothing
to
relate
to
except
that
of
a
normal
lager
although
smelt
rather
fresh
taste
was
a
pleasant
surprise
nice
and
crisp
with
a
sweetness
that
lingered
for
a
while
which
ended
with
a
bitter
note
mouthfeel
was
rather
thin
and
was
very
mediocre
on
fizz
drinkable
anytime
of
the
year
in
the
genre
of
a
carlsberg
heineken
d
they
were
free
and
i
only
drank
one
i
switched
to
vodka
and
oj
for
the
rest
of
the
trip
d
although
it
does
lack
a
certain
fizz
it
is
still
a
refreshing
lager
when
served
ice
cold
however
there
are
certainly
much
better
lagers
out
there
the
taste
is
better
than
i
might
expecti
like
the
burst
of
bitter
eurohops
with
a
very
crisp
finishbut
theres
no
complexity
to
it
its
fairly
drinkable
and
nicely
light
in
the
mouth
but
i
chafe
every
time
at
having
to
pay
as
much
as
i
do
for
it
and
hell
its
not
even
that
much
notes
the
first
in
a
long
line
of
failed
attempts
at
finding
a
gem
while
on
vacation
in
italy
i
did
eventually
find
some
good
stuff
but
it
was
after
too
many
of
these
i
wouldnt
recommend
this
final
thoughts
to
me
this
beer
would
be
a
good
substitute
for
a
macro
beer
however
the
cost
of
importing
makes
that
prohibitive
if
i
was
living
in
denmark
this
would
probably
be
my
generic
beer
of
choice
but
over
here
its
just
too
little
bang
for
my
buck
drinkability
not
a
lot
of
beers
still
taste
like
the
can
but
this
one
certainly
does
im
a
little
put
off
by
it
and
probably
wont
get
it
again
very
light
yellow
clear
with
almost
no
head
and
a
lot
of
large
bubbles
grainy
smell
along
with
yeast
and
slightly
grassy
crisp
dry
grainy
taste
with
a
slightly
bitter
finish
nothing
to
go
out
of
your
way
for
an
easy
to
drink
beer
when
there
is
nothing
else
around
clear
not
that
great
in
taste
kind
of
a
tangy
bitterness
it
smelled
o
k
but
just
not
very
easy
for
me
to
drink
i
tried
it
on
more
than
one
occasion
to
make
sure
i
wasnt
wrong
about
it
and
while
others
drink
a
lot
of
it
i
just
didnt
care
much
for
it
i
love
to
try
beers
from
all
over
and
would
give
this
beer
another
chance
but
first
few
impression
where
not
very
impressive
i
bought
this
on
sale
at
the
coop
buy
one
get
one
free
thats
really
the
only
reason
to
get
this
well
i
picked
up
this
up
cheap
at
the
lcbo
pours
out
a
nice
golden
yellow
color
with
a
thin
line
of
laceing
smells
off
grassy
hop
smells
mixed
with
metallic
ovetones
bad
taste
was
average
for
a
cheap
euro
lager
it
states
its
a
pilsner
no
where
near
that
goes
down
smooth
with
slight
bitter
after
taste
and
a
metallic
twang
mouthfeel
is
full
and
carbonated
meh
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
but
why
would
you
an
inoffensive
cheap
euro
lager
on
the
fence
where
i
come
from
tuborg
has
somekind
of
classic
status
now
being
a
bit
older
and
at
least
a
little
bit
wiser
i
wonder
how
that
happened
tuborg
green
or
grön
as
we
say
here
is
a
bad
beer
smell
and
taste
is
sweet
grainy
doughy
in
a
i
would
say
almost
musty
way
the
whole
beer
feels
halfbaked
unfinished
unripe
green
it
was
pretty
ok
once
when
i
tried
it
together
with
crisp
bread
with
ham
and
mustard
but
otherwise
avoid
this
beer
notes
i
dont
think
id
pick
this
up
again
its
light
but
not
refreshing
it
doesnt
have
a
lot
of
taste
and
where
it
does
its
not
very
good
i
liked
it
but
have
to
admit
i
was
quite
thirsty
i
suspect
the
taste
would
possible
seem
worse
some
other
time
very
drinkable
light
cold
refreshing
nothing
huge
in
the
taste
flavor
department
but
everything
else
i
had
in
italy
beerwise
was
so
bad
this
stood
out
drink
the
wine
average
but
very
drinkable
d
drinkable
but
nothing
special
kind
of
bland
and
there
is
something
strange
and
unpleasant
about
the
aroma
lawnmower
beer
decent
carbonation
easy
to
drink
nice
served
ice
cold
on
a
hot
day
but
really
not
that
great
d
notes
not
really
impressed
at
all
with
this
one
too
sweet
and
the
malt
sweetness
is
not
pleasant
at
all
had
a
hard
time
even
finishing
one
bottle
i
poured
it
was
served
a
bit
too
warm
but
in
my
opinion
this
brew
would
have
to
be
ice
cold
to
even
consider
having
more
than
one
plus
i
cannot
imagine
buying
this
in
the
u
s
after
it
traveled
overseas
i
tried
this
beer
on
february
11
2008
after
purchasing
from
my
local
lcbo
outlet
the
beer
poured
a
translucent
gold
colour
with
a
thin
white
head
the
aroma
was
very
grainy
the
mouthfeel
was
watery
with
little
carbonation
the
flavour
was
as
grainy
as
the
aroma
not
a
pleasing
beer
to
my
palate
this
beer
has
a
very
unique
taste
to
it
that
you
will
not
find
anywhere
else
the
best
thing
to
drink
on
a
rainy
winterday
in
the
middle
of
the
baltic
see

name
too
groen
oel
golden
color
nice

some
kind
of
hey
taste
well
it
is
a
mass
product
my
favourite
mass
product
pilsner
a
competent
german
pilsener
easy
drinking
with
only
the
flaw
of
a
skunky
aroma
cheaper
than
most
euro
lagers
and
better
than
some
not
a
bad
session
choice
but
a
very
average
beer
overall
had
this
on
tap
in
europe
one
of
the
better
brews
i
drank
while
in
israel
this
was
one
of
the
pricier
ones
in
the
bar
being
an
import
but
still
wasnt
very
impressed
the
appearance
was
decent
with
a
nice
golden
color
but
the
smell
was
rather
bland
taste
was
pretty
good
crisp
clean
and
satisfying
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
were
equally
average
and
the
beer
went
down
easily
without
being
too
bitter
would
definitely
go
for
it
again
in
similar
circumstances
but
would
never
cop
a
sixer
of
this
recommended
for
being
an
overall
decent
sample

the

the
only

i

this
was

the
glasses
that
came
with
it
its
nothing
i
would
turn
down
just
not
something
i
would
ask
for
just
about
the
worst
beer
i
have
ever
had
d
i
know
this
isnt
the
most
exciting

out
there

there
are

nothing

came
out
of
a

that
reminded
me
of
the
plastic
pulloff
from
an
orange
juice
carton
poured
fairly
carbonated
2finger

the
beer
had
a

was
standard

with
some
bitterish

smelled
like
the
basement

any

slightly
worse

i
think
this
is
suppose
to
be
a
session
beer
but
i
was
definately
done
after
one
i
did
not
have
to
take
the
full
bottle
or
i
may
just
empty
more
than
half
of
it
d
since
it
has
a
bitter
finish
your

gets
slightly
tainted
promises
lots
delivers

the
only
thing
pleasant
about
this
beer
was
drinking
it
with
swedish
girls
somewhere
along
the
kompagnistraede
pours
with
a
big
white
head
fairly
creamy
at
the
top
lots
of
tiny
bubbles
in
the
rest
straw
yellow

clear

not

some

also
a

rather
medium

at
first
but
turns
a
bit
watery
not
too
malty
but
still
a
bit
sweet
taste
a
tiny
fruitiness
in
the
flavor
as
well
fairly
low
to
medium
bitterness
sweet
and
malty
long
aftertaste
fairly
refreshing
but
a
bit
old
beer
taste
on
the
toungue
after
a
while
drinkability
we
can
call
it
beer
but
not
premium
quality
beer
it
is
drinkable
only
once
or
maximum
twice
per
drinking
session
i
will
not
buy
this
beer
again
it
is
drinkable
if
you
are
into
sparkling
water
but
whether
it
is
worth
picking
up
when
you
want
a
brew
i
would
say
no
d
all
in
all
a
pretty
run
of
the
mill
boring
lager
its
bad
enough
that
they
send
the
gold
to
the
us
i
hope
they
dont
send
the
green
we
have
our
own
green
death
here
in
the
us
taste
is
tolerable
really
not
too
bad
considering
the
price
light
malt
ricey
like
bud
but
a
faint
wineysyrup
hint
in
there
too
good
foamy
mouthfeel
but
not
overwhelming
definitely
more
substance
that
its
american
counterparts
poured
a
golden
color
with
a
white
fine
head
that
went
away
pretty
quickly
leaving
a
ring
around
the
edge
and
thats
about
it
smells
a
little
skunky
with
a
hint
of
citrus
cascade
maybe
not
too
bad
the
taste
is
all
of
hops
and
not
very
pleasant
not
good
at
all
mouthfeel
is
very
watery
not
too
great
either
all
in
all
i
wont
be
getting
this
again
i
should
have
known
from
the
green
bottle
oh
well
waste
of
another
2
50
mouthfeel
naturally
quite
thin
but
what
did
i
expect
drinkability
is
acceptable
i
guess
for
the
style
but
im
making
concessions
here
i
dont
know
how
much
this
costs
but
i
wouldnt
pay
much
having
said
that
its
not
the
worst
only
slightly
below
average
overall
that
was
a
waste
of
10
bucks
i
could
have
drank
from
the
sink
in
the
wc
this
beer
is
a
pale
gold
color
with
a
thick
head
thick
bubbles
that
look
good
right
after
the
pour
then
fade
away
the
aroma
is
kind
of
sweet
with
a
little
hops
mixed
in
light
hop
flavor
and
balanced
with
some
sweetness
taste
has
a
bit
of
sourness
toward
the
end
of
the
glass
the
finish
is
somewhat
dry
thin
almost
watery
mouthfeel
average
but
nothing
special
thanks
to
carson
for
bringing
this
back
not
much
to
add
as
the
drinkability
score
sums
it
up
passably
average
inflight
i
will
hand
it
to
scandinavian
air
they
serve
only
scandinavian
beers
even
if
they
are
pale
lagers
not
a
bud
or
heinie
in
sight
this
pours
out
a
big
meringue
head
that
keeps
you
from
getting
to
your
beer
for
a
while
smell
is
very
sweet
in
rolling
rock
territory
sweetness
is
not
as
evident
in
the
taste
however
maltiness
is
a
little
hard
to
taste
until
after
a
few
sips
then
some
malt
and
hops
come
out
as
you
swallow
but
it
also
comes
across
a
little
too
thin
i
suppose
one
should
avoid
these
big
evil
breweries
who
aim
for
total
domination
of
the
beer
market
but
what
can
ya
do
its
a
cheap
ok
beer
and
im
a
poor
student
im
sorry
all
in
all
a
drinkable
effort
but
nothing
special
golden
colour
ok
head
rather
anonymous
aroma
modestly
hoppy
taste
w
a
decent
crispness
but
lacking
in
the
finish
good
drinkability
a
very
typical
danish
golden
lager
neither
better
nor
worse
than
most
ive
had
a
solid
thirstquencher
nothing
more
this
beer
is
a
pale
gold
color
with
a
medium
thick
white
head
rather
bubbly
too
the
aroma
is
fairly
sweet
with
just
a
little
hops
lightbodied
with
a
light
hops
flavor
and
an
underlying
sweetness
that
turns
more
sour
toward
the
end
of
the
glass
the
finish
is
somewhat
dry
this
is
an
uninspired
beer
i
was
hesitant
to
buy
this
one
based
on
reviews
however
was
pleasantly
surprised
ive
seen
reviews
saying
that
the
beer
si
bitter
however
in
ontario
canada
we
have
the
5
5
version
and
i
find
it
quite
sweet
it
is
also
fairly
smooth
going
down
given
the
cost
about
2
25
per
500ml
can
in
ontario
this
will
be
my
go
to
for
casual
beers
with
the
guys
during
hnic
pretty
hard
to
find
here
locally
as
it
is
not
really
a
favor
for
most
and
has
to
pay
premium
for
a
can
here
in
labuan
the
duty
free
island
of
malaysia
can
an
ordinary
european
standard
lager
pretty
boring
but
works
as
a
thirst
quencher
fruity
taste
overalla
decent
euro
pale
that
gets
the
job
done
among
the
better
of
the
styles
and
worth
trying
if
it
can
be
found
dr
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
decent
quality
especially
for
the
price
which
is
tolerable
by
danish
standards
my
expectations
were
low
based
on
the
original
tuborg
but
i
found
meself
pleasantly
surprised
i
could
drink
this
beer
all
night
it
is
better
than
the
german
beers
i
had
yesterday
d
overall
i
would
never
buy
this
again
unless
there
was
little
else
for
choices
nothing
memorable
here
move
along
pours
a
pale
straw
colour
with
head
that
dissipates
almost
instantly
absolutely
no
lacing
smells
a
little
bit
grassy
with
some
grain
and
metal
but
mostly
faint
flavour
is
slightly
sweet
tastes
marginally
better
than
the
north
american
macro
lagers
carbonation
is
fine
this
was
one
of
those
beers
that
i
would
drink
sometime
before
i
got
into
craft
going
back
to
it
makes
me
wish
i
could
go
back
in
time
and
replace
my
years
mediocre
beer
drinking
with
better

strands

glass
smell
and
taste
are
sweet
grainy
and
applelike
aromas
a

pissy
light
grassiness
butter
some
adjunct
funk
canned
corn
empty
maltiness
and
a
hollow
metallic

to
end
similar
to
most
macro

this
likely
contains
hop

of
actual

mouthfeel
is

with
a
vague
spiciness
midway
mildly
dry
finish
is
grassy
floral
and
somewhat
tinny

on

taste
i
thought
this
was
decent
but
i
now
realize
why
tuborg
gold
is
1
95
per
can
comparable
to
the
worst
bmc
brands
a
standard
euro

is
vegetal
mostly
with
a
faint

of
herbal
hoppiness
some
mineral
notes
faint
kiss

sweetness
flavor
basically
mirrors
the
taste
and
could
not
be
less
bland
the
cooked
corn
notes
arent
too
present
but
some
comes
through
bland
and
boring
even
for
the
style
too
much
veggie
as
well
and
should
have
been
cleaner
mf
is
lightish
noticeably
lacking
in
the
carbonation
department
bad
drinking
allround
not
even
worth
it
in
a
pinch
when
you
crack
open
a
tuborg
gold
dont
expect
a
rich
complex
beer
please
expect
to
drink
a
well
rounded
malty
beer
to
be
honest
when
i
first
saw
this
beer
i
instantly
thought
this
was
going
to
be
another
macro
lager
with
its
watered
down
malts
and
no
bitterness
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
when
i
tasted
crispy
malts
with
a
subtle
hop
bitterness
i
wish
i
could
find
this
beer
where
i
live
very
light
overall
not
terrible
but
not
good
one
or
two
of
these
might
be
drinkable
but
after
that
i
would
probably
switch
to
something
with
more
flavor
or
something
that
is
smoother
overall
well
a
bit
better
than
i
was
anticipating
but
still
a
plain
and
underwhelming
european
pale
lager
take
a
nod
from
the
bohemians
lads
and
investigate
the
world
of
hops
d
well
this
beer
isnt
bad
but
its
not
good
either
theres
almost
nothing
going
on
it
feels
like
they
would
benefit
by
putting
in
more
of
everything
not
as
bad
as
an
adjunct
lager
but
to
mainstream
for
my
taste
although
i
dont
think
i
would
recommend
it
not
a
big
fan
of
this
one
i
wont
be
buying
it
again
any
time
soon
as
for
drinkability
i
could
easily
have
a
few
of
these
watching
a
game
of
hockey
or
something
d
nowhere
near
the
best
beer
i
have
had
in
turkey
a
place
not
really
known
for
beer
musty
grainy
metallic
almost
soapy

its

much

highly
drinkable
this
beer
is
very
refreshing
and
overall
a
good
pick
appearance
was
cloudy
but
could
be
because
of
the
age
of
the
beer
it
appears
to
be
over
a
year
past
the
best
before
date
good
foam
stability
displaying
good

flavor
is
malty
with
a

again
could
be
due
to

of

overall
good
for
a
european
golden
lager
drinkability
this
is
pretty
decent
to
drink
not
much
character
but
it
takes
care
of

crap
d

rinkable
for
sure
for
a
euro
lager
selection
not
skunky
like
some
overall
i
thought
it
was
an
okay
beer
it
was
a
bit
surprising
to
me
that
is
has
some
flavor
out
of
a
bottle
this
beer
was
a
crystal
clear
golden
color
with
lots
of
visible
rising
carbonation
the
head
was
billowing
pure
white
and
left
decent
lacing
off
the
skim
but
otherwise
retained
poorly
the
aroma
was
standard
euro
pale
lager
corn
mash
slightly
musty
malt
and
hints
of
yeast
the
flavors
were
at
first
slightly
sweet
but
the
malt
then
got
blended
away
into
the
slightly
herbal
hoppy
flavors
leaving
no
distinction
between
the
two
not
balanced
just
sort
of
mashed
together
nothing
else
was
going
on
beyond
that
the
body
was
mediumlight
the
carbonation
a
little
too
high
and
the
mouthfeel
prickly
and
watery
typical
and
unpleasant
i

nfrom

my
local
lcbo
outlets
the
beer
pours
a
transparent
pale
gold
with
a
white
bubbly
head
and
a
lot
of
effervescence
the
aroma
is
sickly
grainy
malt
with
a
touch
of
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
well
carbonated
the
flavour
is

else

irnva
hite
does

after
my

i
switched
my
alcohol
option
on
the
plane
to
red
wine
only
if
you
wanna
get
drunk
and
want
carbonation
people
usually
mix
this
with
soju
which
is
korean
distilled
beverage
it
is
an
extremely
easy
tasting
drink
sweet
clear
and
crisp
its
smoothness
making
it
go
down
very
well
there
was
a
lingering
grain
sweetness
throughout
in
the
beer
that
stays
nice
till
the
end
no
bitterness
found
in
this
beer
it
tasted
of
a
little
rice
and
pale
malt
some
grains
and
a
light
hop
flavour
very
refreshing
and
clean
throughout
i
enjoyed
this
beer
this
beer
is
pleasant
and
perfect
for
the
light
beer
drinker
definitely
a
top
class
session
beer
perfect
for
a
night
out
with
friends
to
a
restaurant
say
perhaps
a
korean
restaurant
would
work
very
well
with
some
light
food
pairs
well
with
karaoke

thats
really

o
ive
been
wanting
to
try
this
for
a
long
time
since
i
am
a
fan
of
the
lpga
and
see
several
golfers
with
hite
logos
on
their
equipment
and
clothing
if
i
was
at
a
golf
tournament
in
south
korea
i
could
see
putting
a
few
of
these
away
until
then
ive
had
it
and
dont
see
the
need
to
pay
a
premium
for
it
in
the
states
nice
for
a
refreshment
but
not
much
to
the
taste
bottle
poured
a
clear
golden
color
ale
with
a
pure
white
foamy
head
with
light
retention
and
not
much
lacing
aroma
of
light
adjunct
notes
with
some
cereal
notes
also
perceptible
taste
is
also
dominated
by
light
cereal
notes
with
some
adjunct
and
light
sweet
finish
finish
is
actually
crisper
and
cleaner
then
i
had
expected
body
is
about
average
for
style
with
good
carbonation
this
is
actually
better
than
i
was
expecting
but
still
not
great
though
adjunct
lager
a
bit
above
average
hops
are
mild
but
they
can
be
sensed
and
adjuncts
are
on
the
low
side
and
probably
rice
rather
than
corn
i
was
looking
forward
to
this
after
not
seeing
any
adjuncts
listed
in
the
ingredients
i
was
let
down
when
i
experienced
just
another
bland
massproduced
asian
lager
the
can
states
clean
pure
as
well
as
freezing
point
filtration
system
it
is
surely
clean
and
pure
but
they
seem
to
have
filtered
out
the
beer
flavor
its
notable
the
that
cold
meter
on
the
bottle
label
has
apparently
reached
korea
and
my
bottle
indicated
that
it
was
the
appropriate
time
to
drink
unfortunately
there
were
no
cups
available
to
see
the
beer
to
evaluate
it
properly
but
it
was
obviously
the
goldenpale
lager
color
smell
was
dull
at
best
and
taste
followed
suit
hite
gives
you
the
effervescent
sensation
as
any
other
mass
produced
lager
would
i
drink
it
again
not
a
chance
the
only
uniqueness
to
this
beer
is
that
its
the
only
korean
beer
ive
ever
had
o
this
is
a
poor
product
with
a
big
adjunctvibe
to
it
if
thats
what
youre
into
this
could
be
gold
otherwise
avoid
honestly
this
was
one
of
the
worst
beers
ive
consumed
when
i
think
about
my
least
favorite
beers
this
ranks
better
than
only
corona
and
perhaps
bud
select
sometimes
i
think
that
asian
beer
isb
underrated
and
then
im
like
hey
man
fuck
that
hites
ggood
beer
beer
beer
i
enjoy
beer
but
especially
watered
down
hite
gice
it
a
chance
yiull
love
it
and
if
you
dont
fuck
you
come
onnn
man
oh
man
they
want
youb
to
get
pretentious
as
shit
on
these
reviews
butt
when
it
comes
down
to
it
yum
is
yum
ehhh
i
think
this
would
be
great
with
spicy
asian
food
to
rinse
your
mouth
a
bit
but
it
doesnt
stand
so
good
alone
maybe
on
a
hot
summer
day
but
then
with
so
much
carbonation
oi
like
drinking
this
beer
i
was
able
to
get
a
large
bottle
for
1
59
i
prefer
beer
that
is
economical
and
mellow
one
bottle
is
enough
hite
beer
works
well
with
the
garlicky
spicy
cuisine
of
its
country
of
origin
but
less
satisfying
on
its
own
pale
golden
color
with
a
foamy
soapy
head
that
diminishes
within
a
minute
hints
of
dishsoap
along
with
cooked
cereal
grains
on
the
nose
mildly
bitter
in
the
way
foreign
lagers
tend
to
be
but
not
in
a
big
hoppy
sense
i
taste
sweetness
for
a
second
up
front
followed
by
a
bit
of
sourness
as
the
beer
slides
back
perhaps
more
texture
than
your
big
three
domestics
and
more
than
i
would
have
guessed
for
a
4
5
brew
when
the
bottles
are
superchilled
and
the
weather
is
scorching
i
find
hite
a
refreshing
beer
kind
of
like
high
life
in
that
regard
as
the
beer
rises
in
temperature
it
loses
that
appeal
another
bogstandard
macro
lager
its
relatively
clean
tasting
and
refreshing
but
bland
and
dull
wish
they
didnt
mention
yakima
hops
on
the
label
it
gets
your
hopes
up
that
there
might
be
some
hoppy
aroma
couldnt
really
recommend
unless
there
was
nothing
else
available
out
of
glass
feel
is
creamy
with
carbonation
flavor
is
not
too
noticeable
out
of
a
glass
but
ill
go
so
far
as
to
say
this
beer
is
pleasant
the
taste
seemed
to
bring
out
a
slightly
more
grainy
character
but
i
was
not
put
off
by
it
in
anyway
i
thought
it
went
very
well
with
the
barbecue
beef
i
ate
o
horrible
beer
the
only
reason
it
scored
this
high
with
me
is
because
i
dont
really
like
giving
1s
unless
the
beer
makes
me
puke
not
worth
the
buck
i
paid
for
the
single
12oz
bottle
steer
clear
from
this
on
people
overall
while
the
beer
has
a
nice
crisp
flavour
that
leaves
is
very
refreshing
it
is
in
no
way
anything
to
write
home
about
it
would
work
well
to
tone
down
a
spicy
meal
or
to
beat
the
heat
on
a
summer
day
id
like
a
lot
less
carbonation
though
i
wouldnt
pick
this
up
again
yes
it
goes
ok
with
the
food
but
it
really
isnt
good
beer
and
i
am
not
sure
re
euro
pale
lager
given
adjunct
flavours
this
euro
lager
is
much
like
many
commercial
american
style
light
beers
it
is
very
pale
i
would
say
it
is
right
for
many
light
beer
fans
but
not
for
me
i
did
notice
that
it
is
highly
carbonated
unlike
other
reviews
the
head
lasted
a
few
minutes
and
then
dissipated
as
described
in
my
opinion
it
is
overcarbonated
o
this
beer
goes
down
rather
easy
and
makes
a
nice
accompaniment
to
the
spiciness
of
kfc
korean
fried
chicken
the
body
was
very
thin
and
watery
even
for
the
style
drinkability
was
on
the
why
bother
side
of
the
scale
there
are
better
examples
of
the
style
out
there
overall
not
a
good
beer
try
it
to
tick
it
otherwise
avoid
drinkable
but
nothing
id
seek
out
the
best
part
about
this
beer
is
its
value
just
1
99
for
a
nearly
wine
sized
bottle
onward
a
crack
followed
by
a
noholdsbarred
glug
produced
a
massive
twoplus
fingers
of
fizzing
foamy
bonewhite
head
with
very
limited
retention
hey
if
id
have
known
you
were
going
to
leave
so
quickly
i
would
not
have
bothered
showering
ya
hear
me
ya
jagov
bye
on
an
up
note
the
color
was
a
deepgolden
yellow
to
make
midas
and
croesus
proud
coupled
with
nequality
clarity
enabling
me
to
read
the
postcard
offering
me
a
a
complimentary
entree
for
my
birthday
i
will
be
headed
to
phl
tomorrow
to
the
university
city
mad
mex
to
take
them
up
on
their
offer
once
again
i
digress
nose
had
the
sweetish
smell
of
pure
unadulterated
lager
no
adjuncts
and
my
mouth
began
to
water
i
swear
there
are
more
canned
aals
than
i
would
have
ever
imagined
mouthfeel
was
a
tad
thin
and
it
tasted
like
lager
with
noble
hops
slightly
tangy
mellow
in
a
grassy
way
yum
finish
was
semidry
and
definitely
refreshing
so
kudos
for
them
for
truth
in
advertising
it
really
is
not
a
bad
beer
and
i
would
probably
fill
a
cooler
with
it
for
a
day
at
the
beach
ymmv
overall
impression
i
would
definitely
come
back
to
this
brew
very
refreshing
and
had
a
nice
banana
character
middrink
that
i
found
would
enjoy
this
before
most
bmc
products
and
awesome
we
can
get
something
from
south
korea
thanks
for
carrying
this
friar
tuck
had
a
sushi
restaurant
because
they
were
out
of
hitichino
too
bad
for
me
ive
seen
this
beer
in
an
odd
larger
format
1
6l
plastic
bottle
also
called
the
pitcher
size
the
empty
bottle
may
or
may
not
have
been
thrown
at
a
wyomingan
taste
it
starts
out
tasting
like
an
american
macro
brew
but
the
taste
goes
away
really
fast
and
then
tastes
very
watered
down
o
a
large
production
rice
based
lager
nothing
special
here
pours
a
wan
straw
yellow
not
inspiring
with
a
white
head
that
doesnt
stick
around
for
long
ok
maybe
it
gets
better
aroma
is
typical
of
a
pale
lager
malty
with
a
fruity
hint
flavor
is
typical
crisp
and
malty
and
just
a
little
fruity
nothing
special
but
ok
texture
has
average
body
and
a
fair
amount
of
fizziness
mediocre
but
give
it
a
fair
shake
i
probably
should
have
given
hite
lower
marks
as
it
really
is
not
a
good
beer
but
i
associate
many
fond
memories
with
this
brew
so
that
is
undoubtedly
influencing
my
opinion
d
no
matter
what
the
occasion
i
would
choose
almost
any
other
beer
in
the
world
over
this
one
i
purchased
this
at
lotte
assi
plaza
in
atlanta
4
99
for
a
six
pack
4
5
abv
pours
a
clear
light
yellow
with
a
1
inch
bubbly
white
head
that
fades
to
a
few
bubbles
on
the
top
of
the
beer
no
lacing
whatsoever
smell
is
of
grains
rice
and
cooked
veggies
there
is
also
a
sulfur
smell
that
comes
out
as
the
beer
warms
taste
is
of
grains
bubble
gum
and
vegetable
broth
for
such
a
bubbly
head
the
carbonation
level
is
on
the
low
side
with
a
somewhat
flat
mouthfeel
this
is
a
pretty
bad
beer
their
motto
is
cool
fresh
which
i
would
have
to
disagree
with
on
both
claims
tempted
to
class
hite
as
sparkling
alcoholic
yellowish
water
though
i
can
say
i
never
got
a
hangover
from
it
points
awarded
on
that
basis
if
you
ever
find
yourself
in
sk
feel
no
qualms
about
drinking
20
so
long
as
you
had
a
friend
phonetically
spell
out
what
to
tell
a
taxi
driver
to
get
where
youre
staying
and
youre
confident
you
can
do
it
in

i
edited
the
review
were
neccesary
still
pretty
much
the
same
less
tasteless
as
i
remembered
o
this
might
be
an
ok
lawn
mower
beer
for
some
if
you
are
really
thirsty
and
drink
it
fast
and
colder
i
am
trying
very
hard
to
review
this
keeping
the
style
in
mind
and
thinking
of
other
beers
that
i
have
drank
in
this
same
category
i
have
to
admit
i
do
like
my
beers
on
the
more
aggressive
side
overall
not
a
bad
beer
for
what
it
is
nothing
aggressive
or
offensive
decent
sessionable
beer
overall
drinks
much
more
like
a
cream
ale
than
a
euro
pale
lager
on
that
card
it
acquits
itself
nicely
grab
a
few
bombers
and
bring
them
to
a
card
night
to
give
his
beer
credit
it
is
refreshing
and
has
no
offensive
qualities
it
doesnt
have
any
strong
qualities
either
and
is
borderline
light
beer
id
recommend
drinking
this
with
spicy
asian
food
a
drinkable
beer
that
is
pretty
weak
and
watered
down
it
reminds
me
of
cheap
lager
that
is
usually
served
at
chinese
or
indian
restaurants
across
the
uk
not
bad
but
certainly
not
good
either
overall
forgettable
not
enough
flavor
to
be
interesting
no
major
problems
though
could
be
a
good
companion
to
asian
dishes
yuck
dont
bother
the
reaction
well
i
now
i
dont
want
to
post
this
its
made
in
korea
has
a
ba
rating
of
d
it
has
an
indicator
for
when
its
cold
enough
im
at
a
loss
for
words
fuck
it
im
drinking
this
with
pride
i
have
two
friends
that
live
in
korea
to
teach
english
and
im
cheersing
to
them
to
the
crowd
youre
welcome
to
tell
me
im
obviously
a
noob
at
tasting
330
ml
bottle
with
11112010
printed
on
the
label
not
sure
if
thats
the
bottled
or
best
by
date
also
the
open
mark
on
the
label
turns
blue
at
its
optimal
tasting
temperature
the
open
mark
is
still
blue
so
it
must
be
a
good
time
to
drink
this
served
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
clear
pale
gold
color
with
about
an
inch
white
head
that
went
away
quickly
pretty
much
no
lacing
aroma
is
sweet
and
bready
malt
taste
is
sweet
malt
and
corn
it
doesnt
taste
or
smell
bad
but
its
not
appealing
either
mouthfeelbody
is
light
its
a
bit
slick
and
is
well
carbonated
for
the
style
its
not
a
bad
overall
brew
its
worth
trying
if
you
can
find
a
single
bottle
of
it
somewhere
oddly
reminiscent
of
heineken
my
first
attempt
at
this
beer
was
skunked
luckily
i
gave
it
a
second
try
and
hopefully
this
was
a
genuine
impression
of
what
the
beer
was
supposed
to
be
to
be
honest
it
wasnt
much
better
it
smelled
sweet
but
it
didnt
really
smell
like
anything
it
had
a
starchy
character
with
very
little
flavour
the
only
note
i
could
discern
was
that
of
figs
which
made
it
difficult
to
enjoy
after
half
of
a
glass
it
was
far
too
sweet
for
a
beer
that
is
supposed
to
be
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
in
quantity
ive
had
sweeter
beers
but
with
no
other
discernible
flavour
this
beer
was
cloyingly
sweet
and
that
fig
flavour
just
built
up
as
i
drank
at
the
time
the
only
alternative
was
budweiser
so
i
continued
to
drink
the
hite
figuring
it
was
probably
the
lesser
of
the
two
evils
but
not
by
much
too
much
sugar
in
this
beer
overall
ill
try
pairing
this
with
some
asian
food
does
not
go
well
as
a
session
beer
reminds
me
of
an
astringent
miller
high
life
d
decent
but
forgettable
nice
and
clean
with
lightly
sweet
malt
flavors
but
overall
something
i
probably
wouldnt
buy
it
again
still
better
than
a
lot
of
the
other
brews
available
in
this
style
conclusion
i
dont
know
what
all
the
hate
is
for
on
this
site
for
this
beer
i
mean
a
d
average
this
isnt
trying
to
be
an
imperial
pilsner
the
label
says
cool
and
fresh
which
when
served
chilled
this
beer
is
some
euro
pale
lagers
are
certainly
not
fresh
tasting
but
this
is
closer
i
would
drink
this
as
an
alternative
to
heineken
any
day
d
main
virtue
is
it
pairs
well
with
korean
food
however
prefer
ob
in
that
respect
not
a
beer
one
should
ever
seek
out
i
had
to
try
some
just
because
i
was
there
really
bad
though
i
was
not
expecting
much
but
us
macros
are
much
better
than
this
no
matter
what
kind
of
beers
you
like
all
i
can
say
is
that
this
was
another
tick
clear
pale
yellow
with
a
skim
of
white
foam
that
instantly
shrinks
to
nothing
green
apple
skin
corn
and
cereal
grains
with
some
dusky
herbal
hop
notes
in
the
aroma
light
and
grainy
with
a
distinct
cheap
adjunct
beer
quality
sweet
and
corny
with
a
touch
of
washed
out
hop
bittering
light
and
highly
carbonated
why
is
this
beer
exported
it
really
isnt
worthy
ive
had
american
malt
liquors
that
blow
this
crap
import
away
no
thanks
american
marketers
have
made
bigsellers
out
of
crap
beer
like
heineken
and
corona
lets
see
them
pitch
this
to
the
masses
d
had
with
a
korean
meal
it
makes
ob
cass
look
pretty
good
d
if
you
are
in
korea
and
dont
feel
like
spending
too
much
money
to
get
your
drink
on
then
i
recommend
this
beer
if
not
stay
away
d
i
tried
this
so
i
could
say
ive
had
a
beer
from
south
korea
thats
about
all
ill
ever
say
about
it
though
many
asian
countries
have
substantial
history
and
artisanal
proficiency
at
fermenting
beverages
made
from
rice
and
barley
this
surely
does
not
speak
to
that
the
rice
in
this
malted
beverage
was
used
because
it
was
more
economical
and
would
result
in
a
less
distinctive
beer
this
may
be
koreas
number
one
selling
beer
but
let
us
not
overlook
that
that
statement
is
a
reflection
of
popularity
not
of
quality
overall
i
wouldnt
really
choose
it
out
to
drink
again
maybe
if
i
was
in
the
country
i
hope
the
good
people
there
have
more
to
choose
from
then
this
bottle
from
lcbo
light
gold
modest
white
head
with
fair
retention
light
lacing
of
the
glass
aroma
is
mainstrean
commercial
eurolager
light
noble
hop
grassiness
light
sulphur
must
from
lager
yeast
and
light
grainy
tones
light
body
smooth
with
some
real
malt
and
hop
ambiance
finishes
fast
clean
and
sharp
for
a
light
lager
this
is
better
than
most
commercial
megabrewed
canadian
lights
at
least
its
all
gristed
malt
no
malt
extracts
no
corn
or
rice
and
has
a
modicum
of
flavor
drinkable
but
absolutely
undistinguished
good
for
sake
bombs
and
not
terrible
by
itself
drank
this
while
in
beijing
at
a
korean
restaurant
pours
a
pale
yellow
with
little
head
retention
there
is
a
bit
of
barley
and
malt
flavoring
that
shines
through
on
the
beer
it
has
a
slight
alcohol
taste
not
really
watery
it
was
fairly
good
to
drink
with
the
food
i
was
eating
drinkability
its
definitely
not
appealing
and
i
wouldnt
drink
another
one
definitely
not
d
its
light
low
abv
and
tasteless
if
cold
actually
this
beer
is
almost
tasteless
warm
too
certainly
easy
drinking
if
nothing
else
pretty
much
a
midpack
adjunct
lager
possibly
the
most
flavourless
beer
ive
had
even
beats
kilkenny
in
that
way
however
no
flavour
is
better
than
bad
flavour
drinkability
easy
drinker
would
not
try
again
unless
im
at
a
korean
restaurant
while
i
surely
dont
know
everything
about
the
whole
clean
crisp
and
fresh
claims
on
the
label
i
can
proffer
my
opinion
of
this
average
asian
macro
lager
it
is
certainly
none
of
the
above
but
hardly
offputting
by
the
same
measure
watery
generally
inoffensive
to
your
average
bear
and
good
enough
i
suppose
for
a
tick
from
a
nation
so
preoccupied
with
that
soju
shit
this
is
not
a
great
beer
but
it
serves
its
purpose
and
i
can
only
imagine
the
vast
majority
of
the
demographic
that
drinks
this
beer
could
give
a
shit
less
about
ba
this
is
not
something
i
could
ever
see
drinking
on
a
regular
basis
but
it
actually
pairs
quite
well
with
korean
dishes
that
exhibit
a
lot
of
umami
like
bulgogi
kalbi
or
dol
sot
and
helps
to
cleanse
the
mouth
much
in
the
way
pickled
ginger
does
easy
to
drink
and
goes
perfect
with
korean
bbq
conclusion
it
is
what
it
is
and
what
it
is
is
way
above
typical
for
the
style
verdict
i
would
never
drink
this
on
its
own
but
it
does
an
admiral
job
of
cutting
through
the
sweetness
and
spice
of
daeji
bulgogi
without
overwhelming
it
at
322oz
during
happy
hour
at
my
spot
its
pretty
hard
to
beat
taste
is
watery
grain
sourish
malt
touch
of
corn
ends
with
a
strange
aftertaste
that
is
somewhat
nutty
taste
is
thankfully
much
better
than
the
nose
it
is
sweet
and
grainy
with
a
refreshing
crispness
there
is
even
a
few
hints
of
floral
hops
in
there
that
along
with
the
fairly
high
carbonation
level
leave
a
dry
clean
finish
i
dont
think
i
will
have
much
of
a
problem
finishing
off
my
22oz
of
this
it
would
be
tasty
ice
cold
on
a
hot
afternoon
i
may
go
so
far
as
to
say
i
might
buy
this
again
and
would
not
be
bad
with
some
korean
barbecue
i
dont
think
ill
be
ordering
it
next
time
pours
a
clear
pale
yellow
14
inch
head
of
a
white
color
poor
retention
and
poor
lacing
smells
of
adjunct
and
a
lager
cleanliness
fits
the
style
of
an
american
adjunct
lager
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
crisp
with
a
high
carbonation
level
tastes
of
lager
cleanliness
adjunct
and
some
pale
malt
overall
a
pretty
common
adjunct
lager
m
d
carbonation
is
quite
mellow
and
body
is
quite
thin
this
was
picked
up
simply
because
it
was
available
and
i
dont
see
myself
grabbing
anymore
no
big
recommendations
here
an
easy
drinking
beer
but
i
would
not
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
any
just
slightly
different
than
other
macro
lagers
this
beer
was
surprisingly
not
awful
it
poured
a
golden
color
and
had
decent
head
aroma
was
faint
but
hinted
at
the
presence
of
dare
i
say
it
malt
and
hops
mouthfeel
was
a
touch
thin
not
too
shabby
but
i
wont
be
seeking
this
out
and
i
recommend
you
follow
that
same
course
drinkability
ugh
hite
doesnt
exactly
represent
the
height
of
lager
brewing
from
a
12oz
can
pours
a
clear
light
pale
yellow
not
pretty
at
all
no
carbonation
no
lacing
smells
of
corn
and
very
light
malts
first
sip
is
almost
flavorless
with
just
a
tad
of
hops
and
malts
almost
water
like
i
cannot
imagine
consuming
this
product
look
for
the
soda
style
bottle
hite
pours
a
golden
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
from
a
brown
twelve
ounce
bottle
there
isnt
much
in
the
way
of
aroma
no
off
odors
in
any
case
the
mouthfeel
is
the
same
as
any
other
lager
the
flavor
is
very
mild
there
is
a
bit
of
hops
this
is
a
very
crisp
refreshing
lager
its
probably
as
good
as
any
other
macro
lager
ive
tried
sampled
at
a
korean
restaurant
in
orlando
i
havent
seen
it
available
anywhere
else
in
central
or
south
florida
i
didnt
detect
the
overwelming
sweetness
that
bedevilled
other
reviewers
an
average
to
slightly
below
average
lager
nothing
more
nothing
less
this
drinks
slow
mostly
due
to
the
extreme
sweetness
but
work
well
with
spicy
sushi
i
prefer
this
to
bmc
thinbodied
and
refreshing
with
macrostyle
carbonation
d
its
refreshing
with
some
korean
food
which
is
the
only
way
that
ive
ever
had
it
it
does
its
job
but
its
not
a
beer
to
seek
out
for
enjoyment
on
its
own
good
as
a
thirstquencher
with
spicy
korean
food
as
you
can
drink
it
like
water
and
the
alcohol
is
so
low
is
it
really
4
5
you
wont
even
notice
pours
a
clear
straw
gold
white
head
blah
blah
blah
they
all
pour
like
this
and
the
head
never
stays
very
minor
citrus
tone
it
seems
on
the
nose
flavor
is
well
bad
really
isnt
skunked
but
it
tastes
way
dirty
definitely
not
cleanly
filtered
feel
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
and
the
liquid
is
a
pretty
good
feel
too
but
overall
this
is
one
mediocre
at
best
lager
bad
bad
bad
bad
appearance
is
a
light
golden
in
color
with
a
big
crisp
head
that
dissapates
quickly
smell
of
very
light
adjuncts
taste
is
light
from
malt
to
hops
with
a
bit
of
sweetness
and
good
carbonation
mouthfeel
is
of
course
light
that
has
refreshing
aspects
that
could
be
enjoyed
in
warmer
weather
it
makes
a
good
lightly
colored
water
just
not
worth
the
price
this
beer
is
all
about
crisp
refreshingness
dry
a
bit
tangy
nice
bitterness
like
one
of
those
japanese
rice
beers
very
good
for
thirst
quenching
with
korean
food
nothing
offensive
to
get
in
the
way
better
than
many
of
these
macrolagers
drinkability
perhaps
the
highlight
of
this
beer
you
can
drink
a
lot
of
it
and
very
quickly
if
you
needed
to
that
said
why
bother
overall
not
a
whole
lot
to
dwell
on
here
but
this
is
better
than
almost
any
other
asian
beer
ive
had
a
strange
colour
very
yellow
and
radioactivelooking
but
its
refreshing
and
just
what
i
was
after
overly
carbonated
like
bud
light
and
thats
the
only
thing
that
let
me
know
i
was
drinking
beer
packaging
looks
like
bottled
water
tastes
like
beerflavored
sparkling
water
drinkability
well
this
is
not
a
very
tasty
brew
but
nothing
disgusting
light
flavors
watered
down
and
a
pretty
bad
mouthfeel
overall
this
was
a
trade
i
did
with
someone
not
impressed
with
it
i
gave
it
a
1
because
i
split
this
with
someone
and
i
didnt
finish
it
notes
i
would
put
this
in
the
below
average
category
within
the
style
easy
to
drink
as
i
watch
some
college
basketball
nothing
to
think
about
here
according
to
the
bottle
a
korean
brew
that
i
drank
from
the
bottle
sorry
no
visual
descriptives
as
a
prelude
but
since
there
were
other
reviews
on
this
just
had
to
put
my
2
cents
in
a
strange
empty
tasting
brew
malts
with
no
flavor
but
there
must
be
something
in
it
because
it
leaves
an
awful
aftertaste
drinkabilitynotes
drinkable
rather
nondescript
inoffensive
but
lacking
character
d
naw
im
gonna
pass
next
time
nothing
special
here
couldnve
been
an
american
macro
made
in
milwaukee
and
i
wouldnt
have
known
the
difference
thanks
to
pegasus
for
sharing
drinkability
goes
down
smooth
d
isnt
much
of
a
beer
btw
the
menu
in
the
restaurant
lists
soju
in
korean
with
english
translation
hard
liquor
but
its
definitely
drinkable
overall
not
one
i
will
have
again
you
need
to
drink
this
very
cold
and
very
fast
as
i
mentioned
the
first
sip
wasnt
bad
but
i
let
it
sit
in
my
glass
too
long
and
it
just
got
worse
and
worse
i
didnt
even
finish
the
bottle
however
i
did
see
a
great
poster
that
advertises
this
beer
it
was
not
displayed
but
i
was
fortunate
enough
to
see
it
the
great
bodies
of
naked
women
with
body
paint
on
them
if
you
can
grab
the
poster
leave

do
not
have
have
anything
else
to
say
about
this
beer
first
off
its
one
of
the
lighest
color
beers
ive
ever
seen
if
you
soaked
a
few
grains
of
straw
in
glass
of
tonic
water
for
an
hour
the
color
would
be
unmistakeably
hiteish
the
smells
would
probably
be
similar
too
the
taste
isnt
terrible
its
watery
theres
lil
character
but
it
is
refreshing
at
a
korean
bbq
youll
probably
drink
like
4
before
you
realize
that
its
not
very
good
but
for
those
4
at
that
bbq
joint
hite
does
the
trick
overall
its
a
pretty
decent
refreshing
golden
lager
downed
2
quick
ones
in
nagoya
while
waiting
for
the
train
this
stuf
is
not
bad
somewhat
watery
with
lots
of
head
when
poured
clear
color
with
a
little
lace
some
hops
detected
and
better
than
any
domestic
lite
beers
i
cracked
up
when
i
read
the
can
brewed
with
water
found
under
the
ground
doesnt
have
a
whole
lotta
flavor
but
there
is
something
about
a
cold
beer
on
a
hot
day
after
eating
wasabe
coated
sushi
this
isnt
a
craft
beer
but
i
cant
say
that
it
is
offensive
either
this
your
basic
light
lawnmower
beer
with
a
bit
more
carbonation
and
a
bit
of
extra
hops
not
a
first
choice
but
i
could
drink
this
when
hot
and
thirsty
if
i
had
too
this
beer
is
quite
literally
everywhere
in
my
residence
in
incheon
and
i
utterly
detest
it
many
places
its
the
only
beer
on
tap
and
sometimes
the
only
beer
at
all
making
soju
your
only
other
option
ouch
it
has
a
decent
head
on
it
from
the
pour
a
finger
and
a
half
of
white
foam
that
retains
longer
than
most
n
american
macros
the
body
however
is
a
pale
pale
clear
strawlike
hue
very
washed
out
and
watered
down
looking
the
aroma
is
also
quite
bland
a
quick
intake
of
cidery
corn
sweetness
an
underlying
sourness
and
thats
all
you
get
the
flavour
gets
worse
the
more
i
drink
it
a
grainy
cidery
flavour
with
a
bit
of
an
adjunct
burn
on
the
finish
in
lieu
of
where
the
hops
should
be
the
mouthfeel
is
actually
pretty
average
for
what
it
should
be
for
this
style
except
that
the
sandpaper
rip
of
the
overcarbonation
over
the
palate
and
tongue
spoils
the
party
not
a
very
pleasant
or
userfriendly
beer
for
the
most
part
im
only
halfway
through
the
bottle
and
i
cant
shake
this
nasty
cidery
aftertaste
while
my
tongue
gets
sandblasted
from
every
sip
at
least
theres
some
comfort
knowing
that
the
macros
from
other
countries
overseas
are
just
as
bad
if
not
worse
than
our
own
nothing
to
write
home
about
this
korean
brew
doesnt
bring
much
to
the
already
crowded
dull
tasting
macro
pale
lager
market
sinkability

i
wouldnt
drink
this
again
if
someone
paid
me
to
the
shite
refrence
was
already
used
so
ill
just
assume
that
the
word
hite
is
korean
for
nastyass
crap
in
a
bottle

the
beer
dispenses
from
the
bottle
light
gold
color
with
the
head
bright
white
and
modest
in
size
texture
is
frothy
the
lace
a
thin
velum
like
sheet
to
conceal
the
glass
nose
is
malt
sweet
crisp
and
clean
start
is
sweet
thinly
malted
top
cadaverous
in
feel
finish
is
mild
in
its
acidity
the
hops
present
but
quite
subdued
in
their
spiciness
dry
aftertaste
a
typical
thin
waisted
lager
that
has
little
merit
in
my
humble
opinion
okay
so
hite
isnt
the
greatest
brew
on
the
planet
or
even
in
asia
but
there
are
worse
nonetheless
id
advise
against
wearing
out
a
pair
of
shoes
trying
to
find
it
if
you
enjoy
american
macrobrewed
beers
you
wont
find

notes
one
word
shite
i
was
actually
a
little
surprised
by
this
one
surprised
it
was
not
vile
pours
a
clear
gold
color
with
a
thin
white
head
no
real
lacing
to
speak
of
and
the
head
was
shortlived
the
aroma
is
lightly
sweet
which
was
another
surprise
lightbodied
with
a
barely
average
hops
flavor
the
finish
is
a
little
sweet
and
a
little
fruity
this
isnt
a
beer
i
would
seek
out
again
but
i
would
drink
it
in
korea
over
a
bud
very
pale
golden
beer
very
clear
with
a
ghost
of
a
head
the
carbonation
disappears
quickly
the
smell
is
subdued
almost
nonexistent
the
taste
sweet
slight
and
somewhat
nondescript
theres
some
malt
and
its
a
crisp
drink
but
not
memorable
it
is
what
it
is
a
palate
cleanser
between
bites
of
kimchi
a
rice
lightened
lager
intended
for
people
who
like
easygoing
beers
hites
only
standout
quality
is
an
above
average
bitter
hop
profile
inoffensive
but
there
are
way
better
korean
beers
to
be
had
arent
there
if
you
can
get
past
a
bottle
that
looks
a
bit
like
diet
sprite
this
beers
not
too
bad
ive
tried
this
at
koreatown
l
a
sushi
bars
and
have
found
it
to
be
better
than
all
the
japanese
beers
its
not
quite
as
grainy
tasting
as
the
japanese
beers
and
is
more
drinkable

a

still
an
ok

for

the

the

which
benefits
somewhat
from

nonoffensive
euro
lager
bland
but
seems
to
compliment
most
meals
o
this
beer
is
quite
drinkable
although
the
taste
is
a
bit
bland
theres
nothing
offensive
about
it
and
it
isnt
watery
poured
an
18
white
head
and
left
minimal
effervescence
in
the
body
but
the
head
did
last
a
surprisingly
long
while
clear
straw
yellow
body
verging
on
golden
smells
grassy
taste
is
bmc
and
light
and
smooth
but
definitely
creamier
medium
long
finish
really
its
a
pretty
decent
lager
o
certainly
not
the
worst
or
blandest
macro
out
there
but
i
wouldnt
pay
for
this
stuff
overall
a
reasonable
macro
lager
better
quality
than
the
xxxxs
and
vbs
it
is
a
bit
more
expensive
but
overall
worth
the
extra
5
10
the
body
was
nice
and
crisp
but
did
have
a
bit
of
a
sweet
lingering
finish
drinkability
was
good
the
beer
went
down
easily
enough
and
i
could
see
throwing
a
couple
in
the
cooler
for
sitting
by
the
bay
overall
not
a
great
beer
but
its
probably
worth
a
shot
if
you
see
it
overall
an
average
to
below
average
pale
lager
tasmanias
finest
right
on
it
pours
a
clear
pale
straw
topped
by
a
fingerandahalf
of
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
light
wheat
very
light
grass
and
i
wanna
say
theres
a
hint
of
lemon
rind
but
that
could
just
be
wishful
thinking
on
my
part
the
taste
doesnt
change
all
that
much
though
a
touch
of
sweet
flowers
finds
a
way
to
work
its
way
in
there
its
all
very
light
very
bland
the
body
is
light
with
a
moderate
carbonation
and
a
fairly
watery
feel
overall
a
bland
sad
little
beer
id
like
to
think
tasmania
can
do
better
than
this
james
boags
premium
lager
states
to
be
tasmanias
finest
since
1881
it
poured
like
clear
apple
juice
with
lots
of
rapid
carbonation
and
a
huge
fluffy
head
very
mild
nose
just
vague
sweetness
the
taste
again
was
extremely
mild
a
little
tart
apple
a
little
bittermetallic
taste
and
a
little
bit
of
grass
light
smooth
pleasant
enough
but
not
enough
flavor
or
substance
to
make
it
stand
out
a
pretty
weak
beer
and
not
worth
the
import
price
at
least
i
got
a
tick
out
of
it
so
why
dont
mainstream
brewers
put
some
flavour
in
the
beer
as
a
europale
i
didnt
expect
much
in
the
way
of
complexity
however
this
doesnt
have
that
cleanliness
or
crispness
that
the
head
and
carbonation
alluded
to
in
the
appearance
even
more
so
its
a
bit
flat
in
flavor
and
feel
a
lingering
aftertaste
of
musky
malt
doesnt
help
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
clear
golden
yellow
color
with
a
fizzy
white
head
on
top
the
head
fades
and
doesnt
do
much
in
way
of
lacing
the
smell
of
the
beer
gives
off
the
earthy
lager
aromas
that
are
typical
in
this
style
the
taste
of
the
beer
had
a
decent
grainy
and
lightly
hopped
flavor
to
it
the
mouthfeel
was
light
but
still
had
some
good
carbonation
and
body
overall
its
a
decent
brew
better
than
a
bmc
but
not
by
all
that
much
finish
was
semidry
and
very
satisfying
after
having
had
salad
for
lunch
worth
seeking
out
probably
not
but
it
makes
for
a
pleasant
tick
i
drank
this
just
before
its
best
before
date
of
081211
a
mediumfull
body
for
the
style
helps
to
cover
up
the
lessthandesired
amount
of
carbonation
overall
this
is
an
average
pale
lager
its
absolutely
not
a
terrible
pale
lager
you
shouldnt
run
out
and
find
it
or
anything
but
its
surprisingly
alright
nothing
exciting
going
on
here
with
a
creamy
mouthfeel
a
light
crisp
body
high
carbonation
and
high
drinkability
and
what
could
be
a
session
beer
for
basic
beer
drinkers
but
this
was
so
dull
that
id
only
drink
it
if
there
were
no
better
options
basically
it
tastes
like
an
aussie
bud
overall
this
is
passable
beer
i
am
not
impressed
but
its
not
horrible
either
pass
on
this
certainly
drinkable
better
than
a
lot
of
aussie
lagers
but
nothing
exciting
a
bit
of
tweaking
and
this
could
be
much
better
overall
a
nice
drinkable
beer
that
can
be
enjoyed
medium
body
that
has
a
smooth
finish
and
after
taste
i
feel
like
this
must
be
a
typical
type
of
beer
in
australia
but
i
have
no
idea
its
not
a
bad
drink
but
itd
a
bit
watery
and
bodyless
for
a
lager
mouthfeel
is
clean
and
crisp
and
the
drinkability
is
average
for
its
style
and
abv
a
decent
lager
but
nothing
worth
seeking
out
i
wouldnt
turn
down
another
d
its
not
a
bad
beer
actually
im
sure
i
could
put
back
a
bunch
during
a
cookout
it
just
doesnt
separate
itself
from
the
domestics
or
big
name
imports
that
fill
similar
genres
james
boags
premium
is
a
very
easy
drinker
but
not
the
most
impressive
beer
theres
really
not
much
that
distinguishes
it
from
your
average
lager
aroma
is
crisp
and
malty
not
very
inspiring
but
not
repulsive
either
it
pours
an
average
clear
yellow
with
a
nice
fluffy
white
head
flavor
is
malty
and
crisp
not
complex
again
about
what
one
expects
from
a
regular
lager
texture
is
fairly
fizzy
and
it
leaves
an
ok
tingle
d
as
far
as
lagers
go
this
one
is
average
and
easily
quaffable
if
you
really
enjoy
the
style
would
be
easy
to
drink
on
a
hot
summer
day
but
not
being
the
biggest
lager
fan
i
would
go
for
something
else
dr
tasmanias
finest
is
just
that
a
passable
lager
but
nothing
special
drinkability
this
was
drinkable
but
really
only
because
it
was
the
best
beer
on
offer
ill
certainly
not
seek
it
out
in
the
future
and
i
found
little
in
it
to
set
it
apart
from
the
other
euro
pale
lagers
ive
tried
in
reality
this
is
a
quite
average
beer
with
its
best
feature
being
the
head
even
rating
to
style
this
is
still
lacking
in
any
hop
punch
or
malt
body
not
skunky
and
balanced
i
guess
but
largely
insubstantial
lawnmower
beer
for
a
very
hot
day
its
not
really
that
offensive
it
just
has
very
little
to
offer
you
could
probably
swill
this
down
alright
for
a
while
but
after
a
couple
youd
probably
start
to
hate
yourself
drinkability
this
is
a
very
refreshing
lager
thats
more
american
than
euro
d
would
recommend
it
if
you
ever
go
out
to
outback
as
an
alternative
to
fosters
d
high
drinkability
if
youre
trying
to
get
drunk
if
youre
looking
for
taste
with
a
meal
pass
d
good
similar
price
per
6
pack
to
eurolagers
larger
bottles
smooth
beer
drinkability
its
not
much
its
drinkable
and
inoffensive
but
i
wonder
if
itll
give
me
diarrhea
from
the
375
ml
bottle
marked
28
ncl1448
sampled
on
may
20
2010
the
color
is
mainly
golden
to
pale
yellow
with
a
quickly
rising
then
quickly
fizzling
white
head
but
the
upward
carbonation
continues
throughout
the
aroma
is
potent
with
malts
along
with
a
honeylike
scent
the
mouthfeel
is
in
the
medium
range
the
taste
also
has
this
kind
of
honey
sweetness
mixed
in
the
with
the
mainly
malty
beginning
and
lightly
hopped
finale
not
all
that
bad
but
also
nothing
outstanding
but
i
found
it
to
be
drinkable
enough
to
make
it
a
memorable
experience
md
watery
with
medium
carbonation
not
very
drinkable
at
all
weak
hops
and
grain
flavor
but
enough
to
make
it
beer
slight
mineral
taste
from
the
tasmanian
esk
river
water
source
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
overall
a
passably
inoffensive
lager
i
would
drink
this
over
budmillercoorsheinekenst
pauli
girl
etc
any
day
not
too
crazy
about
the
slightly
soapy
character
in
the
aftertaste

with

from

green
12
7
ounce
bottle
i
cant
get
much
of
anything
in
the
aroma
perhaps
a
slight
bit
of
grain
the
flavor
is
also
pretty
mild
a
touch
of
malt
maybe
some
hops
and
a
bit
of
a
sour
flavor
unremarkable
d
goes
down
easy
but
not
very
flavorful
not
a
lot
to
this
beer
pours
with
a
slight
and
short
lived
head
appearance
is
clear
and
clean
pale
straw
colour
not
much
aroma
other
than
a
slight
bready
note
flavour
is
crisp
with
a
bready
malt
and
slight
grassiness
not
much
in
the
way
of
complexity
but
nice
simple
drinking
its
an
ok
beer
for
a
barbecue
but
not
a
great
beer
for
arts
sake
its
much
better
than
the
average
oz
macro
swill
and
if
you
only
have
these
to
choose
from
then
boags
is
definitely
the
premium
drop
poured
from
a
green
12
oz
bottle
has
a
golden
color
with
a
small
head
smell
is
of
malts
and
a
bit
skunky
taste
is
crisp
refreshing
slightly
bitter
feels
light
in
the
mouth
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
goes
down
with
ease
overall
this
makes
for
a
good
selection
d
a
fine
summer
beer
great
for
its
simplicity
but
not
for
complexity
the
flavors
in
this
beer
dont
misbehave
this
is
one
of
the
best
lagers
ive
tried
in
a
while
and
id
pick
this
over
dozens
of
pilzners
and
similar
styles
pours
a
golden
yellow
color
with
a
slight
head
and
very
little
lacing
the
smell
is
of
corn
and
basic
hops
the
taste
is
of
a
slight
hop
characteristic
and
some
corn
the
mouthfeel
is
moderate
carbonation
overall
you
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
however
there
is
not
a
lot
going
on
to
keep
your
attention
overall
an
above
average
euro
lager
tried
this
beer
simply
because
it
is
from
tasmania
poured
a
straw
gold
with
a
full
course
head
that
stuck
around
well
and
left
some
good
lacing
the
smell
was
full
and
sort
of
sweet
but
this
was
not
reflected
as
well
in
the
flavor
the
flavor
did
come
across
as
being
a
pure
lager
with
a
refreshing
clean
taste
but
did
not
reflect
much
in
the
line
of
grains
or
hop
characteristics
the
low
carbonation
did
lead
to
a
good
finish
to
compliment
this
otherwise
simple
beer
d
very
tasty
and
refreshing
beer
if
i
were
in
australia
this
would
definitely
be
my
session
beer
bottle
poured
into
dimpled
mug
had
a
nice
clear
gold
color
with
a
slightly
sweet
aroma
with
a
hint
of
spice
felt
smooth
but
there
was
a
very
lively
carbonation
to
the
beer
something
that
surprised
me
looking
at
the
pour
refreshing
drink
but
a
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
which
was
also
surprising
given
the
aroma
there
was
nothing
wrong
with
the
flavor
and
it
was
very
refreshing
but
i
would
not
go
out
of
my
way
to
grab
this
one
again
d
this
reminds
me
of
a
good
kolsch
beer
with
the
slight
sweet
sulfur
note
that
enhances
the
hops
but
is
not
over
the
top
the
full
lagered
malt
flavors
are
great
and
it
really
is
a
nice
lager
with
good
depth
and
character
4
very
clear
golden
yellow
and
when
poured
into
a
glass
this
beer
had
a
kind
of
sweet
smell
to
it
surprisingly
it
is
not
bitter
and
it
is
really
quite
smooth
and
i
also
found
it
to
be
light
crisp
and
refreshing
james
boags
is
good
but
its
too
much
like
a
common
lager
to
go
out
of
the
way
for
at
least
in
my
opinion
it
would
be
a
great
beer
if
youre
looking
for
refreshment
as
it
does
have
that
crisp
thing
going
for
it
pours
a
typically
clear
pale
yellow
with
a
modest
white
head
that
faded
to
a
collar
the
aroma
is
lightly
skunky
not
awful
though
the
taste
is
completely
inoffensive
just
like
a
lager
with
medium
carbonation
the
feel
is
light
bodied
drinkability
is
very
good
especially
on
a
hot
day
d
its
ok
for
a
change
and
nice
to
see
what
tasmania
is
doing
these
days
it
says
tasmanias
finest
on
it
i
certainly
hope
this
isnt
true
for
the
sake
of
all
its
citizens
encountered
this
bottle
at
an
outback
steakhouse
in
south
portland
maine
the
color
is
a
completely
clear
gold
with
moderate
carbonation
just
a
whispy
white
cover
and
similar
lacing
the
aroma
is
simple
wheat
and
a
vague
grass
hop
not
much
else
to
capture
here
the
taste
brings
crisp
grass
hop
a
little
more
bitterness
than
the
aroma
would
suggest
refreshing
enough
good
with
a
meal
or
on
a
hot
day
i
suspect
fairly
thin
but
lively
drinkable
i
suppose
but
not
much
enticing
here
just
another
serviceable
lager
and
not
very
australian
based
upon
my
fosters
experience
dont
bother
if
you
have
other
choices
but
its
not
bad
if
options
are
limited
this
beer
pours
a
clear
light
golden
hue
with
two
fingers
of
puffy
white
head
that
leaves
a
fair
bit
of
lace
around
the
glass
it
smells
of
light
wheaty
malt
and
mild
floral
hops
the
taste
is
somewhat
acrid
cereal
malt
and
a
slight
fruitiness
with
a
barelythere
floral
hop
essence
the
carbonation
is
quite
abundant
the
body
moderate
in
weight
and
it
finishes
offdry
and
clean
overall
if
it
wasnt
already
obvious
this
is
a
very
lightlyflavoured
beer
but
it
goes
down
well
in
the
patio
sun
once
the
bubbles
have
settled
however
the
only
thing
premium
about
this
offering
is
the
import
price
d
drinkable
but
for
the
price
i
will
not
be
seeking
again
drinkability
eh
one
of
an
endless
line
of
faceless
instantly
forgettable
vapid
pale
lagers
overall
though
i
enjoyed
it
more
than
most
typical
lagers
flavour
wise
i
cant
see
myself
every
going
out
of
my
way
for
this
over
priced
considering
its
not
an
import
here
and
its
image
as
a
sophisticated
beer
turns
me
off
considering
its
not
that
sophisticated
a
beer
in
a
pinch
id
probably
save
money
and
buy
a
xxxx
over
a
boags
if
i
couldnt
find
a
brew
i
really
enjoyed
one
could
easily
drink
a
few
at
a
time
and
in
a
room
full
of
macros
this
is
certainly
the
best
pick
pours
a
slightly
murky
gold
with
a
waft
of
vegetal
skunk
to
the
nose
offwhite
head
leaves
this
planet
quickly
but
leaves
a
thick
streak
of
lacing
behind
smells
of
green
grass
straw
and
is
a
little
musty
tastes
malty
with
a
surprisingly
good
hop
bite
at
the
end
pretty
crisp
overall
there
might
be
some
spice
hidden
in
the
background
im
also
noticing
some
more
vegetal
notes
at
the
very
end
which
get
a
little
bothersome
as
i
go
and
dont
sit
well
not
overly
tasty
but
not
a
bad
representation
didnt
have
high
hopes
for
this
one
but
it
ended
up
working
out
ok
drinkability
gets
a
good
mark
i
liked
it
and
had
no
problem
finishing
it
not
my
favorite
style
but
thats
the
only
reason
i
wont
revisit
it
if
it
were
served
at
a
party
id
have
it
again
typical
golden
lager
appearance
small
head
fades
to
thin
covering
lots
of
skunk
on
the
nose
some
grainy
malt
and
an
offputting
sewer
like
aroma
sweet
bready
malt
upon
tasting
followed
by
what
seems
to
be
pride
of
ringwood
metallic
bitterness
massively
overcarbed
a
drinkable
brew
but
i
swear
this
is
like
champagne
in
a
beer
bottle
taste
mostly
skunk
and
a
fair
bit
of
hop
bitterness
as
well
this
would
probably
be
a
really
good
lager
if
it
wasnt
for
the
skunkiness
overall
it
is
not
a
bad
beer
but
it
lacks
flavour
sometimes
there
was
a
feeling
the
beer
has
been
diluted
i
liked
this
offering
and
would
recommend
trying
i
would
love
to
have
this
fresh
on
tap
for
comparison
lighter
bodied
but
coats
the
mouth
with
a
very
clean
grain
flavor
no
cornricedextrose
sweet
bullshit
everything
about
this
screams
macro
but
it
has
character
of
its
own
this
has
so
much
potential
but
it
is
so
goddamn
watery
that
you
just
cant
get
much
out
of
it
i
can
see
sitting
down
on
a
really
hot
day
and
having
a
bunch
of
these
to
cool
off
but
it
is
about
as
close
to
h2o
as
you
can
get
bought
this
as
i
wanted
to
try
something
from
tasmania
wont
get
it
again
but
i
can
honestly
say
that
i
dont
hate
this
either
pours
a
clear
pale
yellow
one
inch
head
with
decent
retention
and
slight
to
no
lacing
head
consists
of
large
bubbles
that
impede
retention
smells
of
clean
yeast
and
slight
malt
i
couldnt
detect
any
hops
it
almost
fits
the
style
smooth
and
crisp
mouth
feel
with
high
carbonation
presents
tastes
of
lager
cleanliness
and
slight
malt
mostly
noticeable
in
the
aftertaste
weak
body
overall
pours
a
pale
golden
yellow
with
very
little
head
what
little
white
head
there
is
dissipates
quickly
into
a
small
colar
minor
laciness
aroma
is
very
skunky
taste
also
carries
the
skunk
as
well
as
some
barley
very
sweet
and
sour
aftertaste
the
texture
is
not
watery
but
on
the
thin
side
flavor
is
not
there
to
recommend
as
a
session
beer
notes
from
and
tasted
111407
the
mouth
is
crisp
with
good
carbonation
easy
enough
drinker
given
my
limited
choices
would
i
buy
it
at
the
store
no
but
it
works
d
this
is
a
pretty
boring
and
unremarkable
beer
but
i
think
it
would
be
a
good
food
beer
when
you
really
want
to
showcase
the
meal
and
not
the
beverage
for
example
sushi
is
one
of
my
favorite
foods
and
its
delicate
and
relatively
expensive
so
you
dont
want
to
kill
it
with
an
ipa
or
something
when
i
eat
sushi
i
usually
order
a
kirin
ichiban
or
asahi
and
this
would
be
a
good
alternative
considering
this
was
skunked
and
sortof
thin
in
flavor
this
wasnt
too
bad
obviously
a
fresher
bottle
would
have
drank
better
drinkability
this
is
a
very
refreshing
lager
thats
more
american
than
euro
medium
body
effervescence
fairly
smooth
im
not
a
lager
fan
but
this
was
quite
good
and
i
would
certainly
drink
this
again
clear
and
yellow
poured
from
bottle
with
slight
head
soapy
decent
lacing
smells
grain
corn
some
hops
taste
bland
malt
up
front
hop
fairly
clean
hop
finish
deeper
flavor
than
say
harp
thin
mouthfeel
and
easy
to
drink
i
suppose
but
not
exciting
enough
to
keep
interest
i
poured
this
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
50
degrees
the
beer
was
bready
smelling
and
had
a
nice
golden
color
the
beer
was
sparkly
and
i
thiought
apply
tasting
like
a
cider
almost
the
beer
had
a
nice
white
head
i
did
not
think
it
was
all
that
great
and
will
not
buy
again
d
this
was
a
fairly
overpriced
import
at
a
resteraunt
and
i
was
fairly
unimpressed
not
a
great
flavor
a
bit
harsh
overall
id
rather
go
with
fosters
if
i
was
seeking
an
aussie
macro
lager
d
average
drinkability
but
not
as
crisp
per
style
as
i
like
it
was
a
standard
lager
except
for
the
nice
little
head
of
foam
on
it
that
was
the
only
thing
that
stuck
out
of
this
beer
is
it
worth
a
shot
if
you
never
had
a
tasmanian
beer
that
was
brewed
in
australia
before
maybe
then
worth
a
shot
d
i
think
j
boag
son
should
invest
in
some
brown
bottles
plain
and
simple
while
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
lagers
to
begin
with
i
felt
this
one
would
have
been
pretty
good
had
it
not
been
so
destroyed
by
its
skunky
quality
a
missed
opportunity
overall
a
boring
macro
euro
lager
bland
but
not
offensive
so
it
could
be
used
to
wash
down
some
greasy
food
new
at
my
local
market
thought
id
give
it
a
shot
pours
nice
and
golden
some
have
compared
to
a
becks
kind
of
color
i
would
agree
the
nose
seems
very
two
dimensional
theres
the
soapy
kind
of
smell
and
the
slight
lemon
citrus
notes
great
lacing
and
real
solid
head
nice
bubbles
as
well
overall
really
nice
overpriced
i
think
but
decent
not
something
i
would
go
to
tasmania
for
but
not
bad
for
right
down
the
street
much
better
than
some
euros
ive
tried
d
one
of
the
worst
beers
i
have
had
in
a
long
time
weaker
than
a
lot
of
american
macro
lagers
never
again
d
pretty
standard
fair
i
wouldnt
complain
if
someone
gave
me
one
but
i
wouldnt
purposely
try
to
order
this
not
bad
very
average
beer
here
not
much
to
recommend
it
except
it
is
something
new
not
interested
in
trying
another
one
if
i
didnt
know
better
i
would
say
this
is
simply
molson
in
another
bottle
pours
incredibly
pale
with
a
light
white
head
smells
a
bit
of
honey
with
a
slight
bitterness
the
aroma
carries
through
to
the
flavor
which
is
slightly
honeyish
thin
slightly
malty
with
only
the
faintest
echo
of
hops
mouthfeel
is
pure
water
not
horrible
but
nothing
worth
bothering
about
either
this
lager
has
a
light
golden
appearance
and
a
thin
light
head
it
had
a
sour
smell
lemony
but
also
a
hint
of
butter
it
tasted
a
little
sour
too
but
not
much
of
a
taste
on
the
whole
rather
empty
there
was
no
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
smooth
crisp
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
it
is
refreshing
after
a
hot
day
but
do
not
expect
much
as
far
as
varied
taste
goes
i
had
this
for
the
first
time
at
outback
steakhouse
it
had
a
pale
gold
yellow
color
they
gave
it
to
me
iced
cold
in
a
pilsener
style
glass
smelled
of
mild
hops
and
some
cereal
grains
tasted
like
any
other
runofthemill
lager
which
equals
to
not
much
of
a
taste
probably
the
bud
of
australia
d
not
too
bad
but
i
cant
see
myself
wanting
another
i
cant
help
but
ask
myself
why
bother
not
a
bad
brew
by
any
means
just
a
watery
euro
pale
that
struggles
to
define
itself
taste
has
a
malty
front
with
a
long
slightly
acrid
finish
evidence
of
a
long
bittering
hop
addition
late
in
the
palate
and
a
finish
that
definitely
leaves
an
impression
not
quite
so
complex
but
certainly
a
fair
amount
of
character
on
this
palate
mouthfeel
though
is
slightly
flat
and
lifeless
overall
an
enjoyable
and
interesting
lager
overall
i
would
not
recommend
this
it
was
a
miller
lite
with
a
different
label
really
a
poor
excuse
for
a
beer
i
really
hate
lagers
this
pours
pale
yellow
with
thick
white
head
and
a
good
amount
of
lacing
it
smells
a
bit
skunkywith
some
slightly
grainy
notes
a
very
typical
euro
lagertasting
mostly
like
cornand
malts
with
some
underachiving
hops
that
leave
a
little
more
to
be
desired
i
must
give
creditthis
brew
has
a
wonderful
creamy
finish
that
is
crisp
clean
without
the
typical
skunkieness
i
picked
up
in
the
nose
to
be
honest
it
tasted
like
your
runofthemill
keg
beer
great
for
drinking
games
and
perfect
for
a
summer
bbq
due
to
its
crisp
clean
finish
best
served
very
cold
smell
is
of
a
skumk
swamp
scumskunk
and
old
grass
some
head
but
pretty
weak
it
looks
like
it
could
gore
taste
is
sweet
and
the
bitterness
level
needs
work
a
waste
of
10
bucks
maybe
if
it
was
67
but
probably
never
ever
again
better
than
fosters
and
steinlager
from
nz
but
the
beer
is
light
crisp
and
clean
the
flavor
disappears
fairly
quickly
after
you
swallow
it
overall
i
am
not
impressed
by
this
beer
not
enough
flavor
for
my
liking
but
that
tends
to
be
the
case
with
a
lot
of
lagers
if
you
do
like
it
it
definitely
falls
into
the
session
category
the
beer
was
light
in
color
having
a
small
white
head
the
taste
was
citrusy
and
hoppy
smelled
hoppy
like
you
would
expect
beer
too
had
a
crisp
smooth
mouthfeel
medium
in
body
it
was
really
drinkable
drank
a
bottle
at
outback
with
my
king
crab
legs
when
your
looking
for
a
cold
one
and
have
a
few
of
these
in
the
frig
more
than
likely
youll
be
grabbing
one
of
these
from
the
land
down
under
drinkability
tasty
brew
smooth
refreshing
and
satisfying
pours
a
very
pale
yellow
color
with
a
thin
onefinger
head
aroma
is
mostly
maltcooked
corn
with
some
fruitiness
and
not
much
else
taste
is
cooked
corn
with
bitterness
that
makes
it
unpleasant
to
drink
a
second
sip
confirms
the
same
thing
except
that
theres
more
sweetness
than
bitterness
here
i
dont
honestly
see
anything
premium
about
this
lager
poured
a
clear
golden
color
with
decent
head
and
very
little
retention
aroma
was
kind
of
skunky
and
not
that
inviting
flavor
was
very
similar
to
a
heinken
not
too
impressed
mouthfeel
was
pretty
good
carbonation
level
was
good
drinkability
was
ok
if
you
like
heinken
you
would
probably
like
this
some
cheap
beers
are
just
that
cheap
some
of
them
have
a
time
and
a
place
occasionally
a
cheap
beer
tastes
just
right
my
initial
impression
of
this
beer
was
that
it
would
fit
this
mold
of
having
its
own
right
place
but
never
being
a
good
beer
as
i
got
closer
to
finishing
the
bottle
i
realized
that
there
was
no
situation
where
this
beer
could
usurp
the
rightful
place
of
say
a
budweiser
at
a
ball
game
a
corona
on
the
beach
in
the
sun
cold
as
possible
of
course
or
any
other
situation
basedbeers
the
smell
left
nothing
the
taste
reminded
me
of
a
light
cheap
lager
and
was
surprisingly
similar
in
tastei
felt
to
a
corona
not
a
beer
i
plan
to
pick
up
again
anytime
soon
this
beer
poured
a
very
clear
light
golden
straw
color
with
a
thick
head

some
retention
the
smell
is
hoppy
with
a
touch
of
sweetness
the
taste
is
cereal
and
slightly
sour
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
there
is
a
little
lag
on
the
tongue
in
the
finish
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
is
good

fairly
smooth
id
say
it
is
a
good
cold
quencher
but
not
extremely
exciting
a
decent
beer
no
problem
to
drink
but
i
probably
wouldnt
get
it
again
on
my
own
it
gets
tiring
and
tastes
like
a
slightly
spicier
version
of
many
central
american
beers
this
was
close
to
scoring
a
3
65
if
i
had
raised
taste
to
3
5
but
my
general
thought
is
that
this
is
not
as
good
for
its
style
as
boags
draught
an
american
macro
lager
that
i
found
to
be
tastier
than
the
premium
still
this
is
a
highly
competent
lager
with
no
real
flaws
and
it
is
priced
competitively
i
would
choose
this
over
a
crown
lager
any
day
somewhat
refeshing
but
this
one
is
a
bit
lacking
in
character
when
your
looking
for
a
cold
one
and
have
a
few
of
these
in
the
frig
more
than
likely
youll
be
grabbing
one
of
these
from
the
land
down
under
d
yuck
not
the
worst
macro
lager
but
pretty
bad
why
drink
this
when
you
can
have
sam
adams
sampled
at
outback
steakhouse
expectations
werent
high
and
they
werent
disappointed

drinkability
is
weak
i
quickly
switched
to
coopers
sparkling
which
while
not
great
is
heads
and
shoulders
above
this
swill
i
didnt
expect
much
as
it
was
at
outback
but
while
i
wasnt
surprised
necessarily
i
can
say
its
better
than
most
macros
its
ephemeral
in
places
but
at
least
it
hints
at
some
basic
goodness
the
strength
here
is
the
drinkability
as
the
light
nature
and
crisp
clean
finish
leave
you
ready
for
the
next
one
without
regretting
the
one
you
just
finished
life
can
be
too
short
but
this
is
good
enough
overall
to
not
waste
ones
limited
opportunities
overall
impression
light
fizzy
yellow
three
strikes
youre
out
not
enough
interesting
going
on
to
make
me
want
another
but
not
anything
drastically
wrong
either
overall
a
nice
and
refreshing
beer
reminds
more
of
a
czech
pilsener
a
fine
lager
that
is
full
of
flavor
and
body
yet
still
maintains
the
crisp
and
refreshing
characteristics
you
would
want
this
well
exceeded
my
expectations
i
remember
this
having
more
flavour
but
oh
well
this
is
a
very
pale
lager
with
a
real
clean
light
taste
i
rate
well
above
the
xxxx
fosters
that
taste
of
corn
and
finish
sweet
this
beer
wont
knock
your
socks
off
but
it
tastes
just
fine
on
a
patio
and
is
a
good
example
of
the
style
i
had
this
beer
at
a
recent
family
event
served
cold
the
brew
was
refreshing
but
average
it
has
a
light
gold
color
and
small
white
head
the
aroma
is
of
grain
a
bit
of
european
hops
and
a
little
sulfur
its
similar
to
a
euro
lager
its
light
in
body
with
a
little
more
hops
than
similar
brews
fairly
dry
up
front
with
just
a
little
sweetness
in
the
midtaste
its
a
nice
everyday
lager
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
but
a
consistently
drinkable
brew
nonetheless
fairly
smooth
and
easy
drinking
which
is
not
suprising
given
where
it
originates
from
found
it
perhaps
a
touch
watery
but
still
quite
drinkable
on
a
hot
summer
day
unfortuantely
theres
lots
of
similar
beer
at
lower
prices
that
do
the
same
job
james
boags
premium
lager
is
no
better
than
the
vast
majority
of
euro
pale
lagers
that
are
actually
euro
in
origin
i
know
that
aussies
are
capable
of
brewing
good
beer
one
of
these
days
ill
run
across
one
that
proves
that
point
pours
a
bright
golden
color
topped
by
an
ephemeral
wisp
of
fizzy
white
head
that
disappears
almost
instantly
aroma
of
buttery
sweet
adjunct
malt
a
hint
of
light
fruity
hops
and
just
a
touch
of
skunk
courtesy
of
the
green
bottle
palate
is
light
malt
with
some
euro
noble
hops
and
a
light
sweetness
towards
the
finish
the
body
is
pleasantly
creamy
and
a
tad
buttery
i
guess
the
appearance
and
smell
belie
an
otherwise
solid
lager
pretty
nice
easier
to
drink
than
i
was
expecting
pours
a
threefingered
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
a
thin
layer
leaving
a
good
lace
clear
pale
amber
color
light
carbonation
and
light
bodied
skunky
nose
flavor
is
sweet
corn
with
hops
in
background
good
lawnmower
beer
why
are
premium
lagers
not
premium
1
50
for
a
12
oz
bottle
from
capital
convenience
concord
nh
pours
a
golden
clear
color
with
decent
head
the
carbonation
looks
quite
high
it
smells
a
little
sweet
and
an
piney
the
carbonation
is
very
high
going
down
but
moderately
smooth
there
isnt
really
any
hop
flavor
present
but
is
quite
sweet
with
some
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
overall
i
say
this
beer
is
soso
there
isnt
anything
special
about
this
beer
but
wouldnt
mind
having
this
again
sometime
it
would
make
a
pretty
good
session
beer
great
hoppiness
in
this
one
noble
as
all
hell
grassy
earthen
flavour
dominates
and
theres
a
very
little
bit
of
apple
juice
sweetness
but
nothing
cloying
in
here
at
all
malt
is
just
little
bit
nutty
but
it
dosent
lend
much
to
the
overall
experience
all
in
all
an
extremely
refreshing
and
clean
lager
with
a
decent
hop
profile
which
in
this
style
is
about
all
you
can
ask
for
mouthfeel
is
well
carbonated
but
not
overbearingly
so
extremely
dry
which
is
also
very
welcoming
this
is
very
very
drinkable
to
me
and
its
finally
the
time
of
year
when
im
wanting
this
type
of
brew
fresh
ontap
in
a
bar
in
tasmania
would
be
extremely
pleasant
id
imagine
notes
this
is
one
of
the
better
euro
pale
lagers
ive
had
to
date
very
clean
and
refreshing
without
anything
annoying
or
out
of
balance
id
put
this
up
with
budweiser
as
far
as
being
clean
crisp
and
refreshing
i
havent
had
this
enough
to
know
how
consistent
it
is
but
this
six
pack
was
outstanding
drinkability
was
no
problem
and
i
found
myself
thinking
this
would
make
for
a
decent
summertime
session
brew
boags
premium
lager
is
what
it
is
a
decent
lager
which
is
easy
drinking
but
wont
set
the
beer
world
on
fire
still
not
bad
light
floral
hop
taste
and
a
good
combination
of
grain
hops
overall
this
is
actually
a
lager
that
managed
to
survive
the
trip
over
here
pretty
well
and
would
be
worth
another
purchase
not
a
complex
beast
but
id
certainly
welcome
a
few
of
these
on
a
warm
summer
day
could
be
a
an
american
macro
or
a
pale
euro
either
way
its
another
adjunct
lager
actually
has
head
and
great
lacing
although
its
in
a
green
bottle
i
dont
detect
any
skunk
just
smells
like
watery
beer
really
taste
is
light
sweet
but
a
touch
harsh
and
a
little
creamy
id
call
it
a
slightly
bolder
version
of
bud
light
not
quite
bud
but
with
slightly
lightstruck
d
im
more
impressed
with
this
beer
than
i
thought
i
would
be
not
to
say
that
this
is
something
that
i
would
buy
very
much
of
but
for
what
it
is
and
is
supposed
to
be
its
pretty
good
a
good
lawnmower
or
bbq
beer
the
beer
pours
a
very
pale
gold
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
light
pale
malt
scent
along
with
a
hoppy
aroma
that
reaks
of
german
hops
and
lager
yeast
the
taste
is
average
it
has
a
grainy
pale
malt
flavor
that
goes
down
bitter
and
finishes
with
hints
of
metal
yuk
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
its
a
low
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
an
average
euro
lager
its
light
and
bitter
but
it
just
doesnt
have
good
flavor
drinkability
drinkable
sure
but
at
4
25
a
bottle
ill
save
my
money
for
something
better
pours
a
clear
pale
golden
color
with
a
fizzy
white
head
quickly
fading
into
a
wispy
lace
nose
is
fresh
grain
and
grassy
hops
thankfully
no
skunky
aromas
despite
the
green
bottle
taste
is
sweet
malt
and
dry
grain
along
with
some
herbal
grassy
hop
bitterness
pretty
basic
possibly
a
good
thirst
quencher
but
thats
about
it
pours
a
golden
yellow
with
an
average
head
with
lots
of
carbonation
no
distinct
smells
tastes
like
youre
average
lager
watery
and
without
much
taste
the
alcohol
very
present
which
is
surprising
for
a
beer
with
only
5
unfortunately
this
beer
is
average
and
thats
about
it
this
is
an
interesting
brew
its
better
than
average
but
pales
to
the
kiwis
much
better
steinlager
down
in
tazmania
come
to
tazmania
we
mean
you
its
always
a
tossup
between
this
and
coopers
pale
ale
when
im
down
at
the
bottle
shop
looking
for
a
carton
to
take
to
a
party
or
back
home
to
watch
the
game
with
the

notes
what
the
hell
do
the
folks
down
under
really
drink
not

not
this
stuff
coopers
maybe
anyone
please
help
me
with
this
pondering
and
pestering
question
presentation
packaged
in
a
custom
twelveounce
green
glass
bottle
with
a
popoff
crown
embossed
tasmanias
finest
served
in
a
standard
pint
tap
glass
tasted
like
a
pilsner
from
america
only
better
no
bitterness
and
not
too
over
carbonated
which
was
nice
mostly
smooth
character
with
a
grassy
feel
pours
a
clear
yellow
with
very
small
bubbles
that
be
seen
only
at
the
top
of
the
beer
light
head
only
a
half
finger
big
with
no
retention
plenty
of
grass
adjncts
in
the
nose
good
and
dry
adjuncts
though
the
taste
is
a
little
tart
almost
but
i
guess
thats
just
the
dryness
of
the
light
hopping
and
sanguine
malts
very
refreshing
maybe
dryer
than
i
previously
thought
great
session
beer
if
im
n
tasmania
i
liked
this
lager
good
lager
for
all
occasions
a
6pack
at
the
local
chinese
would
be
perfect
overall
a
typical
lager
but
i
will
say
this
is
better
than
the
average
american
lager
when
i
eventually
make
my
way
to
tasmania
i
would
drink
this
again
best
on
a
hot
day
well
the
alstrom
bros
asked
us
all
to
be
nice
and
practice
diplomacy
when
reveiwing
beer
having
said
that
this
beer
is
horrible
well
actually
they
asked
us
to
give
reasons
why
the
beer
is
rated
poorly
if
we
in
fact
do
first
the
beer
leap
out
of
the
green
bottle
with
a
medium
hue
and
low
levels
of
carbonation
the
aromas
of
cream
corn
gives
my
first
impression
at
second
sniff
i
also
smell
skunk
aromas
uuummm
breakfast
of
champions
the
taste
is
unfortunately
similar
to
the
characteristics
found
in
the
nose
though
not
as
strong
the
beer
is
adjuct
laden
giving
a
grain
flavor
and
texture
little
in
the
complexity
department
the
flavor
does
have
light
apple
and
pear
flavors
to
go
along
with
its
moderate
malt
flavor
which
saves
this
beer
from
hosting
a
really
bad
rating
the
finish
is
sweet
and
less
than
refreshing
almost
scrubbed
to
the
throat
simply
not
a
good
offtering
worth
a
try
but
not
much
going
on
ive
been
waiting
two
years
to
see
this
in
the
us
and
i
finally
found
it
at
my
local
store
it
was
almost
worth
the
wait
smooth
crisp
taste
with
just
the
right
balance
of
hops
and
malt
and
a
decent
mouthfeel
a
bit
pricey
but
one
of
the
few
imports
outside
some
of
the
germans
that
i
feel
worth
a
try
it
is
crisp
cleansing
and
well
carbonated
that
at
least
lifts
it
above
the
average
lager
that
is
readily
available
but
i
couldnt
justify
paying
the
premium
price
that
it
is
undeservedly
placed
on
it
pours
a
pale
straw
color
with
a
light
white
fluffy
tall
head
pretty
impressive
for
a
macro
sticks
around
for
a
while
too
smells
yeasty
and
hoppy
no
skunk
despite
the
green
bottle
good
so
far
taste
is
not
very
malty
more
hops
than
anything
but
really
not
much
of
anything
no
bad
flavors
though
mouthfeel
is
a
tiny
bit
harsh
but
not
bad
all
in
all
its
a
good
beer
very
drinkable
would
be
better
if
it
didnt
cost
so
much
though
bb

good
poorout
with
a
nice

not
overwelming
but
lasting

nose
is
malts
litle
sulphuric
and
litle
oxidated
taste
is
sweet
malty
very
light
and
probably
very
high
fermented
this
and
no
tastable
bitterness
make
this
one
pale
and
flat
oxidation
did
his
part
to
it
but
am
shure
would
pass
this
one
fresh
for
anything
with
litle
more
taste
pours
a
straw
yellow
with
light
foam
head
which
dissapates
quickly
there
is
a
sweet
fruit
aroma
which
is
faint
but
inviting
the
beer
itself
is
slightly
hoppy
with
a
sweet
middle
and
dry
finish
it
also
has
this
distinct
taste
which
i
notice
in
most
tasmanian
beers
must
be
the
water
down
there
anyway
good
beer
just
not
great
does
the
job
a
bit
pricey
though
pours
out
a
clear
light
golden
colour
very
impressive
tight
white
head
on
the
pour
and
just
as
impressive
head
retention
sticky
clinging
lace
down
the
glass
the
nose
is
very
sweet
and
fruity
at
first
that
of
ripe
melon
accompanied
by
strong
floral
hops
and
a
bit
of
sweet
grain
the
flavour
in
turn
is
the
converse
bready
malt
some
grain
husks
and
a
very
crisp
dry
finish
with
no
real
discernable
aftertaste
in
fact
no
real
finish
either
where
did
those
hops
go
i
can
easily
tell
that
this
is
hot
weather
beer
brewed
in
a
warm
climate
for
the
locals
it
lacks
in
flavour
but
is
very
quenching
better
than
any
caribbean
lager
ive
ever
tried
very
dry
and
quenching
mouthfeel
not
exactly
smooth
because
the
carbonation
does
lend
a
bit
of
a
bite
not
an
exceptional
lager
by
any
means
especially
not
for
the
price
but
not
very
flawed
either
just
lacking
in
more
flavour
but
i
get
the
feeling
this
was
meant
to
be
a
quenching
beverage
for
time
spent
in
a
hot
climate
this
is
australias
best
lager
because
its
flavoursome
refreshing
and
a
good
session
beer
that
everyone
likes
it
looks
good
light
gold
becks
colour
has
good
head
retention
its
very
well
carbonated
but
not
too
much
and
has
different
flavours
in
different
areas
of
the
mouth
most
notably
the
aforesaid
fruity
flavours
which
only
occur
in
the
rear
corners
around
the
tongue
its
somewhat
overpriced
but
is
better
than
the
other
readilyavailable
australian
and
imported
premium
lagers
heineken
becks
nastro
azzurro
and
is
far
better
than
cascade
and
hahn
premium
its
not
the
best
australian
beer
as
certain
coopers
and
redback
are
superior
but
its
definitely
a
reliable
beer
from
a
reliable
brewery
its
got
a
nice
picture
on
the
label
too
the
one
in
the
photo
is
wrong
thats
now
the
label
for
cascade
premium
my
only
problem
with
this
beer
is
its
high
price
overall
an
average
to
good
beer
although
i
would
be
more
inclined
to
experiment
on
something
different
before
trying
this
again
crystal
clear
with
a
deep
gold
sheen
the
head
is
limited
dissipating
quickly
but
leaving
a
thin
whispy
layer
of
offwhite
around
the
edge
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
pretty
basic
malt
hops
not
impressive
but
there
are
some
hops
here
the
body
is
light
and
gives
a
somewhat
thin
mouthfeel
the
flavor
starts
with
a
lightly
bready
malt
followed
by
some
limited
hop
flavor
and
finishes
with
a
short
dry
hop
aftertaste
crisp
refreshing
slightly
dry
lager
although
this
bottle
doesnt
show
any
signs
of
age
oxidation
etc
i
suspect
its
lost
a
lot
of
its
character
probably
much
better
on
draft
standard
aussie
lager
not
much
flavour
to
speak
of
but
quite
smooth
and
crisp
sadly
i
dont
think
this
will
imporve
now
that
san
miguel
has
moved
in
rated
from
previous
tasting
notes
not
much
flavor
tastes
like
miller
high
life
definitely
one
of
my
favorite
euro
lagers
kronenbourg
is
consistent
and
has
some
very
endearing
qualities
i
like
the
fact
that
it
has
a
frothy
head
that
lingers
and
leaves
intermittent
ridges
of
lacing
it
far
less
skunky
than
the
average
euro
so
you
can
actually
smell
and
taste
the
hops
its
light
on
the
palate
nicely
carbonated
and
very
consistent
regardless
of
how
its
served
cest
une
biere
delicieuse
the
beer
has
much
more
complexity
than
people
give
it
credit
for
i
happened
to
think
that
it
was
very
good
it
was
refreshing
and
a
very
easy
beer
something
for
the
golf
course
or
something
31
bottle
light
golden

taste

your

l
the
european
version
of
coors
light
is
not
for
me
maybe
im
still
in
my
beer
snob
stage
but
i
do
not
drink
light
beer
for
the
taste
when
i
drink
beer
i
drink
for
the
rich
malty
maybe
chocolatey
or
nutty
tastes
obviously
thats
not
kronenberg
but
i
tried
it
to
try
it
and
my
suspicions
were
verified
sorry
for
the
rating
pulling
it
down
but
i
gotta
keep
it
100
a
light
tasting
lager
very
little
carbonation
and
not
much
upfront
taste
a
smidge
of
a
bitter
beer
aftertaste
decent
flavor
and
enjoyable
leave
it
to
the
french
to
do
a
trashy
blonde
euro
lager
with
some
modicum
of
style
good
clean
lager
with
high
drinkability
enjoy
as
mentioned
in
other
reviews
this
is
easily
the
best
of
the
mass
produced
on
the
style
and
always
a
safe
bet
as
it
is
widely
available
here
in
europe
overall
this
isnt
an
exciting
beer
but
its
ridiculously
clean
and
wellbalanced
ive
never
given
much
thought
to
the
style
but
this
was
surprisingly
pleasant
and
in
my
opinion
definitely
beats
its
competitors
best
mainstream
beer
in
the
uk
i
enjoy
this
beer
great
taste
good
carbonation
not
too
strong
not
too
weak
very
enjoyable
had
at
chef
de
france
at
epcot
i
was
hoping
for
more
all
in
all
a
nice
crafted
beer
and
quite
an
enjoyable
drinking
experience
mainly
due
in
my
opinion
to
the
complexity
of
the
flavours
truly
a
well
balanced
beer
i
like
this
beer
and
will
look
forward
to
my
next
drink
good
served
ice
cold
on
the
train
from
brussels
to
paris
at
1030
am
a
good
eye
opener
for
sure
if
you
are
in
the
mood
for
a
cheap
euro
lager
and
when
are
you
ever
not
in
the
mood
for
that
prefer
it
to
stella
or
heineken
decent
beer
even
for
the
frogs
500
ml
can
poured
into
a
lager
glass
pours
clear
straw
colour
with
light
fluffy
head
very
little
nose
slightly
skunky
very
little
flavour
and
slightly
skunky
slightly
better
than
some
north
american
mass
produced
beers
but
not
great
i
was
expecting
a
tasteless
industrial
lager
but
this
is
crisp
and
balanced
lager
with
perceivable
hops
didnt
get
me
off
my
feet
but
i
would
sure
session
this
this
maybe
my
favorite
session
beer
of
all
time
light
but
flavorful
smooth
with
a
hint
of
hop
great
with
food
especially
pubcomfort
food
a
delight
just
ok
a
little
breadybiscuity
with
a
pilsnerlike
floral
hop
aroma
not
that
bitter
probably
a
little
skunked
from
the
green
glass
bottle
overall
this
was
the
main
beer
i
had
at
my
wedding
we
got
hitched
in
rural
france
in
the
summer
the
guests
were
a
mix
of
dutch
british
irish
and
french
with
all
that
in
mind
i
needed
a
drink
that
would
suit
a
session
so
the
guests
could
drink
it
all
day
be
refreshing
in
the
heat
and
suit
a
lot
of
different
tastes
while
not
being
too
over
powering
i
tried
a
lot
of
different
beers
that
were
available
to
me
in
the
area
and
this
one
came
out
on
top
for
me
it
suited
the
eclectic
taste
of
the
french
guests
the
crisp
pilsner
like
tastes
of
the
dutch
and
the
darker
hoppy
taste
of
the
british
and
irish
this
was
not
completely
perfect
but
it
was
more
than
good
enough
to
keep
everyone
happy
that
about
says
it
all
this
beer
is
an
awesome
allrounder
and
i
have
very
fond
memories
of
it
every
bottle
now
takes
me
on
a
magical
memory
journey
and
as
we
live
in
the
uk
im
pleased
to
say
this
beer
travels
well
o
a
very
solid
beer
the
green
glass
bottles
are
no
good
and
did
allow
some
skunkiness
into
part
of
the
sixpack
but
the
beer
still
tasted
good
a
kind
of
muted
pilsener
with
some
decent
bread
malt
notes
and
a
bit
of
bitterness
but
way
less
than
a
good
pilsener
its
interesting
how
the
greengrassy
hop
smell
doesnt
translate
into
taste
this
brews
good
enough
that
i
might
seek
out
others
from
the
brewery
though
this
particular
beer
is
most
likely
a
oneoff
for
me
everything
it
has
to
offer
while
good
i
can
get
in
a
better
german
beer
from
500
ml
can
aroma
of
hay
and
bread
pours
a
clear
slightly
golden
pale
with
frothy
head
slight
sweet
taste
light
body
oily
texture
lively
carbonation
and
a
slightly
bitter
finish
seems
to
me
like
a
slightly
creamier
and
sweeter
version
of
the
euro
lager
so
choose
the
1664
blanc
over
the
1664
original
u
won
t
get
disappointed
o
typical
euro
for
the
most
part
aboveaverage
taste
overall
not
a
bad

lager

a

for

french
beer
at
thati
had
long
forgotten
since
our
trip
abroad
in
03
this
beer
poured
fresh
presented
well
cleansed
the
palate
as
a
pilsner
is
apt
to
do
and
offered
just
enough
flavor
to
elicit
a
satisfied
night
overall
nicely
crafted
and
quite
good
i
look
forward
to
drinking
this
lager
beer
whenever
i
buy
it
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
for
his
first
sampling
of
a
french
beer
bucky
selected
kronenbourg
1664
1664
the
beer
came
in
a
500
ml
can
with
a
best
before
date
of
may
2014
printed
on
the
bottom
and
was
5
0
alcohol
by
volume
1664
poured
an
absolutely
clear
golden
colour
with
some
large
slow
rising
carbonation
bubbles
visible
pouring
produced
about
1
of
bubbly
white
head
that
faded
to
a
thin
collar
of
foam
and
patchy
film
within
2
minutes
the
retreating
foam
left
some
modest
lacing
behind
this
is
certainly
a
good
looking
beer
its
aroma
was
of
sweet
light
malts
with
hop
undertones
i
see
on
the
list
of
ingredients
that
the
beer
is
made
with
hop
extract
the
first
time
ive
seen
this
in
a
beer
the
beers
taste
was
sweet
caramel
malts
up
front
followed
immediately
by
a
secondary
burst
of
sweetness
finishing
with
a
mild
hop
bitterness
which
lingered
as
a
noticeable
but
unobjectionable
aftertaste
1664
was
light
bodied
had
a
typical
level
of
carbonation
and
a
bit
of
a
thin
mouthfeel
essentially
this
is
very
similar
to
though
slightly
sweeter
than
most
european
lagers
an
inoffensive
but
uninspiring
brew
1664
sells
for
2
60
per
500
ml
can
a
bit
on
the
pricey
side
given
its
runofthemill
profile
really
didnt
like
this
witbier
have
had
a
lot
of
good
blondes
from
craft
breweries
and
finding
myself
in
a
pub
with
no
actual
microbrews
available
thought
i
give
this
big
brewery
blonde
a
try
couldnt
get
away
from
the
feeling
i
was
drinking
fizzy
apricot
waternot
just
apricots
but
dried
apricots
with
the
sulphur
preservative
hints
overall
might
have
been
a
bit
skunked
but
was
definitely
a
tasty
brew
albeit
not
as
good
as
when
i
previously
enjoyed
it
viable
option
in
the
euro
pale
lager
field
1664
white
is
really
a
superb
experience
as
well
both
highly
recommended
its
an
excellent
beer
the
taste
is
also
very
nice
initially
there
is
slight
sweetness
which
is
followed
by
nice
hoppy
bitterness
the
finish
is
also
pleasantly
bitter
making
this
beer
a
very
enjoyable
experience
overall
nothing
special
about
this
beer
if
not
for
the
harsh
carbonated
finish
this
could
be
a
decent
lawn
mower
beer
ps
i
always
give
a
score
of
3
for
nonsmelling
lagerpilsners
im
a
lager
fan
and
this
has
to
be
one
of
the
best
ive
had
from
a
bottle
very
crisp
and
refreshing
with
nice
light
hops
and
enough
complexity
to
keep
it
interesting
beats
stella
artois
handily
the
thinking
mans
epl
if
there
is
such
a
thing
nice
downing
just
one
but
this
would
make
a
nice
session
o
better
than
the
american
macros
theres
at
least
some
flavor
to
be
had
here
fairly
aggressive
hop
character
for
the
style
too
still
skunky
and
watery
though
and
there
are
other
euro
lagers
id
turn
to
first
taste
rather
refreshing
with
a
crisp
slightly
spicy
finish
created
by
the
hops
it
produces
a
tang
on
the
tip
of
my
tongue
i
would
say
it
is
a
little
maltier
than
heineken
but
remains
very
sessionable
overall
drinkable
enough
this
is
probably
great
on
a
hot
day
its
pretty
clean
with
an
emphasis
on
grain
which
i
like
but
its
a
hair
to
sweet
to
just
guzzle
away
my
mark
out
of
one
hundred
would
be
55
pours
a
standard
euro
pale
lager
straw
with
a
thin
layer
of
bubbly
white
foam
that
quickly
dissipates
aroma
nondescript
a
sour
breadiness
sparkly
white
grape
maybe
a
hint
of
bubblegum
beer
is
overly
carbonated
making
it
difficult
to
nail
down
the
flavors
i
got
pale
malt
dilute
lemonade
and
red
sour
berry
notes
and
a
floral
tang
not
sure
where
the
hop
extract
used
in
this
beer
hails
from
but
there
was
a
distinct
floral
top
note
that
added
some
interest
to
an
otherwise
dull
euro
industrial
lager
harsh
metallic
flavors
and
a
bit
of
skunk
albeit
less
of
the
latter
than
comparable
beers
id
drink
this
before
heineken
but
alas
that
is
damning
via
faint
praise
o
one
of
my
goto
european
lagers
this
holds
up
well
to
many
european
pilseners
and
lagers
ive
had
whilst
living
in
central
europe
i
quite
enjoy
this
brew
it
is
easy
to
put
many
of
these
down
and
the
interesting
flavor
never
seems
to
get
old
truly
a
well
balanced
beer
one
i
will
be
seeking
out
even
as
i
return
to
the
us
worth
a
try
just
do
it
you
may
be
pleasantly
surprised
o
a
nice
lager
ubiquitous
in
paris
and
quite
enjoyable
if
you
are
not
to
busy
drinking
wine
o
wont
drink
it
againboring
industrial
lager
overall
not
sure
how
old
it
is
or
why
i
even
got
it
all
i
know
is
these
guys
make
a
pretty
decent
witbier
yet
not
a
good
clean
crisp
tasting
lager
pass
if
you
can
not
a
really
great
euro
lager
pass
on
this
overall
a
really
great
beer
and
one
of
the
better
europ
pale
lagers
i
have
had
the
flavors
are
so
clean
and
crisp
and
it
is
an
extremely
refreshing
beer
o
is
this
beer
or
sierra
mist
this
beer
is
not
for
me
this
is
a
nice
easy
drinking
and
refreshing
beer
light
in
colour
and
alcohol
content
it
has
a
subtle
taste
of
apricots
and
sweetness
that
goes
perfectly
with
the
summer
sun
and
a
hot
day
to
be
honest
i
have
difficulty
choosing
anything
other
than
the
blue
bottle
any
time
im
buying
beer
this
is
a
solid
offering
and
could
easily
be
enjoyed
by
someone
who
does
not
even
like
beer
o
overall
a
pretty
average
beer
not
much
to
it
really
other
than
some
wheat
bread
and
biscuit
malts
easy
to
drink
cheap
and
easy
to
find
but
i
stopped
ordering
them
and
stuck
with
the
belgians
i
could
find
when
possible
overall
one
of
my
favorites
while
overseas
i
tried
this
one
first
and
kept
revisiting
im
kind
of
kicking
myself
for
not
trying
more
while
over
there
but
its
a
testament
to
this
beer
i
think
great
quality
while
on
tap
i
cant
say
how
it
survives
that
terrible
green
bottle
if
shipped
over
here
have
to
retry
then
repost
review
because
i
believe
something
was
off
for
it
to
taste
that
badly
maybe
the
french
just
like
weird
tasting
beer
though
live
life
drink
beer
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
one
it
was
left
here
on
new
years
by
a
friend
and
so
i
consumed
it
thinking
it
would
be
garbage
but
nope
enjoyed
it
minus
the
smell
very
simple
beer
clean
profile
and
refreshing
similar
to
an
american
adjunct
lager
clear
gold
body
decent
head
with
spotted
lacing
aroma
is
kind
of
shy
with
mild
fruit
and
cereals
taste
is
more
of
the
same
but
with
a
grainy
minerallike
background
average
overall
and
inoffensive
though
not
particularly
exciting
i
wouldnt
turn
this
one
down
on
a
hot
day
but
i
really
cant
see
paying
good
money
for
this
one
again
3
29
cdn
for
the
can
overall
well
not
nearly
as
bad
as
i
thought
it
would
be
just
a
hint
of
skunk
from
the
green
bottle
and
touch
of
metallic
hot
lager
yeast
like
off
flavor
otherwise
a
light
profile
but
crisp
fairly
clean
and
drinkable
pilsner
with
lighter
but
decent
malt
profile
and
touch
hops
could
use
a
bit
more
overall
for
just
about
everything
but
still
drinkable
great
for
a
hot
summer
day
i
bet
but
still
could
do
without
the
green
bottle
kronenberg
1664
this
euro
pale
ale
got
decent
beer
advocate
ratings
im
switching
over
from
my
summer
wheat
beer
habit
to
other
fare
and
thought
a
few
pale
ales
were
in
order
before
the
big
ipa
and
stout
season
begins
coming
from
france
i
was
not
sure
what
to
expect
what
the
kronenberg
turns
out
to
be
is
a
moosehead
basically
the
1664
has
an
amber
body
light
carbonation
and
white
head
the
aroma
is
mostly
malt
the
flavor
is
spot
on
moosehead
with
layered
malts
up
front
and
a
smooth
finish
text
book
canadian
lager
why
is
this
well
the
french
did
settle
eastern
canada
so
is
what
i
think
of
as
a
canadian
style
beer
really
a
french
style
beer
from
the
11
2
oz
green
bottle
sampled
on
june
25
2012
the
pour
is
pale
to
golden
yellow
with
a
fizzy
white
head
that
sticks
around
it
looks
like
it
is
supposed
to
so
i
will
give
a
high
mark
for
that
the
aroma
is
pretty
weak
as
far
as
traditional
lagers
go
with
light
malts
crisp
hops
corn
and
grain
the
body
is
light
to
medium
the
taste
is
grassy
slightly
malty
and
clean
at
the
finish
the
green
bottle
makes
it
weaker
than
it
otherwise
could
be
overall
no
surprises
here
folks
just
move
along
not
worth
refusing
if
it
is
the
only
thing
on
offer
but
you
can
do
better
even
in
this
genre
overall
an
above
average
euro
pale
lager
by
kronenbourg
there
are
some
well
balanced
grassy
grain
and
malt
flavours
which
sets
this
brew
apart
from
others
in
the
same
style
category
overall
it
hit
the
spot
on
a
hot
day
overall
i
had
this
for
the
first
time
at
mcdonalds
in
paris
just
now
had
it
to
review
it
not
bad
for
what
it
is
o
a
pretty
enjoyable
pale
lager
maybe
a
tiny
step
above
the
typical
imported
lagers
of
heineken
and
stella
o
easy
enough
to
drink
and
definitely
sessionable
but
not
one
of
my
personal
favorites
there
is
nothing
very
distinctive
about
this
beer
the
flavor
and
aroma
are
very
generic
for
the
style
this
is
really
really
good
it
has
flavor
and
character
its
drinkable
sessionable
and
ultimately
enjoyable
ive
never
been
a
big
fan
of
this
style
due
to
the
seemingly
regular
off
flavors
metallic
skunky
grainy
but
this
beer
doesnt
have
those
characteristics
its
worth
checking
out
if
you
want
something
light
and
sessionable
o
another
lager
with
no
distinguishing
features
really
sessionable
but
well
ensconsed
in
the
pack
of
mass
produced
lagers
worse
than
stella
and
heiniken
and
carlsberg
overall
nothing
that
really
blows
you
away
but
in
comparison
to
others
in
this
euro
lager
catagory
this
one
seems
a
little
better
mouthfeel
is
appropriately
thin
and
very
carbonated
very
easy
drinking
o
probably
a
good
beer
to
give
to
my
bud
drinking
friends
and
a
beer
i
could
drink
a
bunch
of
because
it
goes
down
easily
but
not
my
favorite
odjust
a
slightly
beefier
euro
lager
went
down
easy
and
that
will
be
the
biggest
compliment
i
will
lend
this
beer
o
ive
enjoyed
this
beer
here
and
abroad
i
think
it
is
a
notch
better
than
most
of
the
mass
produced
euro
pale
lagers
been
a
long
time
since
the
chumleys
passport
day
that
first
introduced
me
to
this
beer
wasnt
a
fan
then
but
maybe
things
have
changed
after
all
those
years
it
pours
a
clear
very
pale
straw
topped
by
a
finger
or
so
of
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
rice
husk
light
funky
wheat
and
hard
water
the
taste
holds
notes
of
funky
wheat
rice
hard
water
chalk
and
what
seems
like
fake
lemon
creeping
in
from
some
dank
room
in
the
back
o
the
place
ax
in
hand
the
body
is
light
with
a
moderate
carbonation
and
a
watery
feel
overall
im
still
not
a
fan
of
this
beer
the
supposedly
arrogantly
quality
hops
dont
come
through
very
well
and
things
just
taste
super
watery
and
super
adjuncty
if
that
makes
sense
drink
it
was
just
pretty
average
i
wont
knock
it
for
what
it
is
its
a
staple
in
europe
and
france
but
just
too
bland
for
my
liking
o
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
and
has
a
better
taste
and
thicker
mouthfeel
compared
to
others
in
the
style
o
the
beer
is
okay
overall
the
taste
isnt
great
which
greatly
brings
down
my
opinion
of
the
beer
i
brought
a
500ml
can
back
from
a
recent
trip
to
europe
the
beer
pours
out
looking
like
a
pale
clear
yellow
with
decent
carbonation
that
forms
a
white
head
that
eventually
vanished
the
smell
was
weak
and
slight
grains
the
beer
flavor
of
the
beer
was
typical
of
most
euro
pale
lagers
in
my
opinion
mouthfeel
was
a
light
body
and
overall
it
was
just
ok
o
decent
euro
lager
nothing
to
write
home
about
will
be
in
strasbourg
in
less
than
a
week
would
like
to
compare
to
a
fresh
one
at
its
home
but
there
are
so
many
other
beers
to
enjoy
typical
euro
lager
and
nothing
to
write
home
about
served
on
tap
at
brasserie
les
halles
seemed
like
a
good
selection
to
go
with
a
classic
french
meal
clean
golden
color
with
a
thick
white
head
served
in
appropriate
glassware
sweet
slightly
grainy
aroma
taste
was
enjoyable
compared
to
some
of
the
other
brews
in
the
style
a
little
grassy
a
little
bitter
but
it
at
least
had
some
degree
of
flavor
and
was
relatively
light
and
enjoyable
to
drink
not
my
favorite
style
but
for
a
pale
lager
this
was
a
tasty
option
o
well
overall
it
wasnt
awful
but
the
smell
was
distracting
dont
inhale
when
you
drink
this
beer
taste
was
decent
but
it
maybe
a
little
too
sweet
i
wouldnt
buy
again
or
recommend
overall
good
lager
bought
this
for
a
friend
because
his
wife
just
got
back
from
paris
and
recommended
it
overall
highly
drinkable
but
not
worth
the
premium
import
price
the
bar
was
charging
for
it
its
just
another
slightly
above
average
eurolager
that
is
a
dime
a
dozen
in
my
area
dr
high
price
by
french
standards
very
easy
to
drink
id
have
it
again
its
refreshing
and
pairs
decently
with
a
burger
o
a
decent
pale
euro
lager
which
is
easy
to
put
back
on
a
warm
september
day
not
my
style
but
certainly
drinkable
and
worth
a
try
overall
very
drinkable
and
not
heavy
would
pair
well
with
casual
fare
good
for
warm
weather
drinking
i
recommend
it
as
a
decent
tasting
lager
without
much
of
a
flavor
challenge
overall
try
it
and
you
probably
wont
look
back
the
best
french
beer
ive
tried
yet
smooth
and
refreshing
brew
damn
good
cold
its
own
twist
because
its
french
i
suppose
they
like
to
have
their
own
twists
however
i
am
in
love
with
this
beer
this
style
and
similar
styles
are
hard
to
stand
out
in
but
this
one
does
theres
some
sort
of
ineffable
magic
here
maybe
its
that
special
hop
they
talk
about
on
the
package
its
simple
crisp
smooth
refreshing
and
all
too
easy
to
put
back
a
few
pours
a
clear
golden
yellow
with
a
1
inch
fizzy
offwhite
head
that
fades
to
a
film
on
the
top
of
the
beer
random
spots
and
streaks
of
lace
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
there
is
a
slight
skunky
aroma
upon
first
opening
this
bottle
after
that
the
smell
is
of
sweet
grains
and
some
grasshay
aromas
taste
is
of
sweet
grains
grassyhay
notes
and
an
herbal
hop
bitterness
on
the
finish
the
bitterness
is
pretty
mild
and
fades
from
the
palate
after
each
sip
i
am
also
getting
a
slightly
metallic
taste
this
beer
has
a
pretty
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
and
clean
mouthfeel
overall
this
a
pretty
good
european
lager
that
is
pretty
enjoyable
o
really
nice
lager
a
great
step
up
from
the
aal
and
an
epl
of
note
one
of
my
personal
favorites
it
goes
under
the
radar
for
most
but
it
shouldnt
now
i
remember
what
stuck
out
about
this
beer
the
taste
is
quite
distinctive
its
slightly
sweet
to
start
with
some
graininess
coming
through
there
is
quite
a
lot
of
hops
for
this
style
of
beer
and
makes
for
a
different
flavour
with
a
nice
bitter
finish
highly
drinkable
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
beer
was
how
the
taste
was
surprisingly
distant
and
clean
from
the
abrasiveness
from
the
nose
while
the
aromatics
offered
that
classic
metallic
adjunct
lager
vibe
the
taste
was
crisp
with
a
cleaner
finish
although
the
flavors
didnt
pop
they
were
mellow
and
light
enough
to
keep
this
beer
refreshing
and
not
entirely
undesirable
overall
maybe
based
on
my
sentimental
memories
but
for
me
a
perfect
example
of
the
style
no
this
is
not
for
me
reminds
more
of
a
candy
shot
than
a
beer
cheers
o
theres
nothing
special
here
but
its
a
pretty
good
beer
my
favorite
aspect
was
how
clean
it
was
on
the
finish
very
refreshing
d
there
is
no
reason
why
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
buy
this
when
it
tastes
like
most
all
barley
lagers
but
as
far
as
euro
lagers
go
this
is
one
of
the
better
ones
overall
goes
toetotoe
with
most
other
european
macros
picked
up
a
bottle
of
this
as
part
of
a
mixed
6
pack
from
crazy
bruces
in
connecticut
this
beer
pours
out
looking
like
a
pale
yellow
water
with
some
carbonation
the
head
was
white
and
vanished
almost
immediately
the
smell
was
funky
almost
had
a
sour
aroma
to
it
or
skunked
even
the
beer
flavor
of
the
beer
was
a
lot
like
a
becks
in
my
opinion
it
just
wasnt
anything
great
or
even
decent
this
was
thankfully
the
first
of
the
6
i
had
that
night
so
i
have
5
more
to
get
the
taste
outta
my
mouth
poured
clear
goldenyellow
with
a
slight
white
head
and
fizzy
carbonation
grassy
aroma
some
sickening
sweetness
sweet
malts
in
the
taste
very
light
grassy
hops
moving
on
to
mulch
and
leaving
a
skunky
taste
in
the
mouth
light
bodied
and
not
very
drinkable
at
all
after
one
glass
i
was
done
drinking
for
the
night
tinny
sharp
finish
mineraly
carbonation
mass
produced
malt
and
hops
profile
beer
is
drinkable
but
totally
passable
overall
a
good
clean
euro
lager
have
had
this
in
french
countryside
before
so
the
bottle
brought
back
good
memories
overall
meh
this
is
your
average
adjunct
lager
under
another
label
save
the
money
you
would
spend
buying
this
import
and
buy
domestic
youll
get
practically
the
same
thing
o
overall
this
seems
to
be
a
nice
euro
pale
lager
minus
the
right
amount
of
hops
bitterness
malt
quality
and
water
and
brewing
process
is
fine
but
hop
bitterness
is
low
but
that
might
be
the
standard
for
a
french
made
lager
still
a
nice
drinking
beer
the
beer
starts
off
like
you
would
expect
from
a
french
lager
pale
gold
color
fluffy
white
head
just
a
hint
of
skunk
familiar
with
greenbottled
european
lagers
that
you
get
here
the
taste
however
is
a
bit
surprising
theres
still
that
light
sweet
grain
but
theres
some
honey
and
a
little
bit
of
spice
too
just
a
touch
of
clove
maybe
the
mouth
feel
is
fuller
than
similar
beers
really
good
lacing
too
worth
a
try
if
you
want
something
light
refreshing
and
with
at
least
a
modicum
more
character
than
anything
with
light
in
the
name
poured
from
330
ml
can
into
my
pilsner
glass
nice
fluffy
white
head
that
dissipates
pretty
quickly
some
very
mild
lacing
light
golden
color
smell
is
eurolageresque
slightly
sweet
with
just
a
bit
of
bitter
aftertaste
tastes
a
little
sweet
but
acceptable
or
slighly
above
average
mouthfeel
is
nice
light
and
slightly
bubbly
overall
a
decent
beer
i
could
drink
a
few
lounging
around
the
house
or
on
rota
beach
one
side
note
is
that
the
can
said
5
vice
the
listed
5
9
abv
dgood
extremely
drinkable
rjt
very
enjoyable
on
a
hot
spring
day
in
texas
its
what
bud
heavy
is
supposed
to
taste
like
simple
and
good
ill
be
back
for
more
appears
a
light
orangish
yellow
with
a
soapy
head
and
lacing
aroma
of
euro
hops
and
pale
malts
in
the
taste
pale
malt
a
trace
of
hop
and
a
mild
cooked
veggie
taste
not
the
cleanest
example
but
its
alright
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
and
feel
is
soft
with
medium
low
carbonation
average
is
written
all
over
this
one
eh
overall
not
the
most
interesting
of
beers
but
it
nails
the
balance
between
drinkability
and
taste
i
would
prefer
more
flavor
and
complexity
but
it
is
what
it
is
o
pretty
foul
stuff
though
probably
not
the
worst
beer
ive
ever
had
drinkability
enjoyed
two
back
to
back
would
like
to
try
in
a
can
or
on
tap
if
available
could
easily
start
off
a
night
with
a
few
of
these
but
wouldnt
go
straight
to
it
got
a
nice
buzz
from
these
two
beers
as
well
or
maybe
it
was
the
bottle
of
wine
earlier
in
the
night
all
in
all
this
is
pretty
decent
lager
with
all
standard
qualities
and
with
good
drinkability
id
say
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
ill
try
it
again
d
this
beer
is
certainly
clean
enough
and
easy
to
down
however
its
so
bereft
of
flavor
that
i
have
no
real
desire
to
revisit
it
it
is
easy
to
drink
but
i
find
the
smell
and
taste
of
this
one
too
pungent
also
the
few
times
ive
tried
single
i
coincidentally
felt
really
rough
afterward
so
i
have
no
need
to
try
it
again
after
this
review
i
am
frenchamerican
but
to
be
honest
i
did
not
expect
much
france
is
more
of
a
wine
nation
obviously
i
was
very
pleased
however
to
find
that
i
very
much
liked
this
beer
overall
i
liked
this
beer
very
crisp
and
light
for
being
aalmost
6
i
would
recommend
this
beer
httpabarwithnoname
wordpress
com
d
much
better
from
the
taps
than
any
other
kind
of
serving
type
ive
had
the
beer
in
london
in
three
forms
cans
bottles
and
on
tap
and
while
the
bottled
and
canned
versions
still
taste
better
than
most
getting
a
draft
of
1664
is
the
way
to
go
definitely
a
must
try
if
you
have
access
to
it
on
tap
drinkability
i
enjoy
this
beer
a
lot
i
could
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
without
regret
d
this
beer
has
well
blended
subtle
flavors
but
a
good
depth
and
a
lot
of
flavors
i
look
for
in
a
good
kolsch
i
was
very
surprised
and
impressed
this
came
out
of
a
green
bottle
d
very
drinkable
well
balanced
basic
lager
i
had
a
lot
of
trouble
separating
the
ingredients
on
my
tongue
to
analyze
the
taste
at
all
stick
to
wine
france
stick
to
wine
this
beer
pours
brilliant
gold
with
a
loose
single
finger
foamy
head
which
remains
for
nearly
the
life
of
the
beer
nose
is
grainy
with
a
hint
of
citrus
and
grapefruit
grain
with
floral
notes
and
corn
flavors
the
beer
is
thin
and
falls
down
throat
with
ease
has
a
sweet
finish
and
leaves
palate
cleansed
this
is
a
decent
pils
wouldnt
turn
it
down
refreshing
and
very
drinkable
id
say
it
is
better
than
most
beers
of
this
style
just
dont
expect
to
be
knocked
off
your
barstool
12
oz
bottle
would
never
bought
it
myself
but
my
friend
braught
it
over
not
very
appetizing
color
im
not
sure
if
there
were
any
aroma
maybe
very
slight
bread
and
sweet
malt
very
watery
on
the
palate
taste
of
sweet
corn
i
could
not
finish
the
bottle
color
is
somewhere
between
straw
and
golden
crystal
clear
with
a
bleached
white
head
with
good
retention
light
lace
aroma
is
predominantly
resinousgrassy
with
a
touch
of
grain
some
metallic
notes
are
also
present
clean
up
front
with
a
nice
amount
of
carbonation
hoppy
middle
that
quickly
fades
to
a
grainy
finish
a
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
soapy
on
the
finish
medium
body
very
drinkable
my
fears
of
this
being
another
skunky
european
beer
in
a
green
bottle
were
unfounded
i
imagine
i
will
buy
a
few
more
of
these
from
time
to
time
pours
a
nice
goldish
orange
color
with
very
little
head
smell
is
a
bit
skunky
almost
like
a
heineken
or
a
straub
taste
is
light
and
more
on
the
sweet
side
very
smooth
and
is
extremely
easy
to
drink
very
refreshing
and
is
an
easy
beer
to
sit
back
and
drink
bottle
solicited
from
cold
storage
in
singapore
half
litre
can
looks
like
a
typical
euro
lager
clear
a
bit
pale
and
lots
of
bubbles
can
taste
hints
of
caramel
and
chemicals
lots
of
carbonation
can
drink
a
few
pints
of
this
but
not
too
many
its
not
the
best
ps
its
the
5
abv
brewed
in
gb
version
would
be
interested
in
trying
the
brewed
in
france
version
taste
weird
yeast
strain
seems
to
jump
on
my
tongue
not
allowing
any
taste
of
very
light
saaz
hops
id
guess
to
do
anything
slight
breadiness
just
really
put
off
by
the
taste
evolves
into
a
slightly
more
tolerable
bitter
hay
feel
dry
but
eh
had
this
at
the
paris
france
casino
in
vegas
might
have
been
old
but
it
just
wasnt
agreeable
with
me
extremely
drinkable
best
euro
lager
ive
had
in
recent
memory
would
make
a
great
session
beer
drinkability
wow
a
very
very
nice
lager
drinkable
to
the
extreme
with
a
very
lot
of
flavor
for
the
style
definitely
worth
trying
and
so
much
better
then
most
lagers
out
there
today
taste
is
similar
pleasant
lightly
sweet
appley
grain
with
light
zesty
grass
and
lightly
spicey
herb
hint
it
has
light
bitterness
underlying
the
sweetness
hay
and
grass
dominate
the
aftertaste
the
character
that
it
has
is
pleasant
firm
and
with
enough
going
on
to
keep
it
interesting
while
it
is
highly
drinkable
feel
is
fairly
good
solid
and
not
watery
or
rough
the
hops
are
mild
and
add
a
spicy
blend
to
some
of
the
alcohol
flavors
that
smooth
it
out
and
add
too
drinkability
all
this
said
everything
else
is
quite
typical
a
pretty
crisp
and
refreshing
beer
that
i
would
reccomend
to
get
to
know
the
style
d
very
easy
not
my
favorite
style
but
very
easy
to
drink
its
like
a
french
miller
lite
its
not
bad
for
a
french
beer
seeing
that
the
french
have
very
few
beers
that
they
actually
brew
inland
in
comparison
to
other
countries
for
the
record
the
other
two
kronenbourgs
ive
tried
were
kronenbourg
and
kronenbourg
blanc
both
in
paris
as
far
as
i
can
recall
i
like
this
one
above
both
of
those
pours
a
nice
gold
color
with
an
one
finger
to
one
and
a
half
finger
head
which
gives
way
to
some
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
musty
adjunct
malts
and
a
hint
of
hop
and
sweetness
the
taste
is
a
adjunct
malt
backbone
with
a
little
hop
bite
and
a
nice
candy
sweetness
to
it
the
mouthfeel
is
moderately
carbonated
the
drinkability
is
good
its
a
nice
easy
drink
nothing
to
reall
dislike
and
the
flavor
is
enjoyable
you
could
easily
do
a
session
of
this
a
nice
flavor
for
this
class
poured
this
beer
into
a
pint
glass
the
foam
that
was
produced
was
a
fair
amount
of
a
12
finger
the
smell
that
aromatics
from
the
beer
is
that
of
wheat
and
fruit
tones
the
taste
follows
that
of
the
aroma
but
adds
in
a
maltiness
to
it
giving
a
warmer
feel
on
the
tongue
overall
a
good
beer
to
sit
back
with
during
the
hot
summer
days
dnot
a
bad
tasting
beer
at
all
nice
flavor
i
dont
know
about
style
conformity
because
of
the
flavors
but
a
good
beer
i
would
drink
this
again
mfd
very
flat
in
taste
though
that
may
be
due
to
the
can
the
flavors
what
little
there
are
do
not
linger
long
on
the
tastebuds
d
im
enjoying
this
one
sessionable
for
sure
really
refreshing
and
tasty
maybe
cause
its
french
haha
who
knows
but
i
would
drink
this
one
again
d
not
a
bad
beer
could
easily
drink
a
few
in
a
sitting
d
when
it
comes
to
euro
pale
lagers
ive
had
quite
a
few
since
i
live
in
europe
this
is
one
of
the
better
ones
d
this
beer
i
find
to
be
rather
average
the
flavors
in
this
beer
didnt
mesh
well
for
me
but
i
suppose
the
general
nature
of
this
beer
permits
to
be
drinkable
to
those
who
find
the
flavors
acceptable
d
high
drinkability
if
you
are
having
several
beers
a
good
beer
for
quenching
thirst
on
a
hot
day
nothing
impressive
pitchers
at
galaxy
hut
arlington
d
on
the
right
night
this
is
quite
drinkable
light
flavor
some
husk
and
vines
and
again
with
some
clove
this
isnt
outstanding
but
its
not
bad
easy
drinking
without
that
over
stale
malt
aftertaste
i
expected
o
quite
drinkable
and
honest
lager
which
is
something
really
difficult
to
find
recommended
not
a
bad
drop
but
a
little
more
pungent
in
the
proper
french
version
but
unfortunately
dont
have
the
real
stuff
here
very
difficult
to
get
the
real
thing
here
in
australia
i
was
hoping
this
would
be
a
decent
offering
since
their
new
wheat
beer
is
actually
not
too
bad
drinkability
not
one
that
i
would
go
back
for
in
the
store
but
if
it
were
on
tap
i
could
certainly
enjoy
a
pint
or
two
of
it
too
thin
and
sweetish
without
balance
at
2
55
a
half
liter
this
is
totally
overpriced
final
grade
3
62
a
b
i
imagine
it
would
taste
a
bit
better
in
france
and
that
maybe
the
trip
to
virginia
took
its
toll
on
this
one
but
who
knows
what
is
up
with
imports
with
green
bottles
being
so
skunky
this
is
why
people
turn
their
noses
up
at
craft
beer
this
is
posh
to
most
bmc
drinkers
but
have
no
idea
what
else
is
out
their
after
judging
all
on
stuff
like
this
there
are
way
better
euro
lagers
out
there
some
are
actually
pretty
good
but
not
this
skunky
mess
changed
my
ratings
as
i
wrote
this
i
would
drink
this
over
heineken
any
day
fairly
smooth
and
balanced
just
lacking
intensity
that
first
whiff
of
skunk
was
nothing
other
than
that
no
offensive
elements
here
just
wish
they
made
this
a
bit
stronger
in
flavor
real
surprise
not
that
bad
at
all
d
very
drinkable
perfect
if
youre
looking
for
a
light
foreign
lager
on
a
hot
summer
day
refreshing
and
delicious
drinkability
absolutely
the
beer
that
is
adorned
in
every
brasserie
in
paris
has
a
spot
in
my
fridge
anytime
i
poured
apprehensively
into
a
pint
glass
to
a
pillowy
white
head
european
beers
with
green
bottles
always
make
me
cringe
it
is
gold
in
color
the
aroma
is
weak
bready
malt
the
taste
is
sweet
and
bready
it
has
that
metallic
taste
that
often
accompnies
green
bottles
the
mouthfeel
isnt
bad
but
i
cant
get
over
the
taste
this
is
probably
my
last
dabble
with
kronenbourg
drinkability
ok
i
dont
think
id
try
it
again
nothing
special
drinkability
average
euro
pale
lager
that
i
am
not
likely
to
get
again
i
love
the
glass
unfortunately
not
the
beer
i
would
not
turn
this
down
if
offered
to
me
but
will
not
likely
pick
up
again
has
a
good
refreshing
lager
flavor
d
fantastic
i
can
drink
this
beer
alday
without
becoming
tired
of
it
wouldnt
mind
drinking
more
of
these
if
i
was
drinking
all
night
but
this
is
not
something
i
will
buy
again
or
stock
in
my
fridge
it
just
seems
like
a
generic
allweather
no
reason
allseason
beer
that
just
wouldnt
get
called
upon
to
do
battle
with
my
thirst
but
the
5
9
abv
earns
it
some
extra
points
because
it
is
quite
smooth
finishes
nice
beer
is
light
in
the
body
light
in
flavor
overall
no
aftertaste
finishes
completely
wet
not
dry
drinkability
and
mouthfeel
are
good
its
just
boring
another
french
beer
usually
not
the
best
very
corny
on
the
nose
smells
like
pilsner
malt
and
adjuncts
very
watery
with
a
good
crispiness
like
a
nice
pilsner
a
definite
corn
like
taste
comes
through
hard
to
believe
the
abv
not
much
to
this
one
but
nothing
bad
either
a
very
crisp
and
clean
taste
seemingly
void
of
unpleasantries
of
most
green
bottle
macros
even
though
it
is
february
here
in
new
york
i
could
see
this
going
very
nicely
with
a
light
dinner
in
an
outdoor
café
somewhere
on
the
french
mediterranean
holds
a
decent
head
for
the
style
had
this
beer
in
a
restaurant
on
tap
the
12
pint
1
finger

nice
light
blond
color
good
smell
the
thing
i
liked
about
this
beer
was
the
taste
it
is
ncie
and
easy
there
is
no
weird
taste
like
the
stella
artois
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
a
friend
d
not
one
that
i
would
reach
for
again
i
always
enjoy
trying
something
different
but
when
i
try
something
different
that
turns
out
to
be
just
like
every
other
pale
euro
lagerbeer
then
i
need
to
do
better
research
on
the
brew
before
buying
it
good
thing
i
just
bought
this
as
a
single
for
1
79
last
time
i
will
do
so
notes
easy
to
drink
and
inoffensive
beer
but
nothing
special
about
it
if
you
want
something
light
and
easy
to
drink
at
a
bar
this
isnt
a
bad
choice
i
dont
dislike
it
i
just
dont
find
the
flavor
anything
special
it
has
a
great
color
it
is
fairly
drinkable
has
a
decent
mouthfeel
and
smells
like
your
average
euro
pale
lager
tasted
at
le
village
buffet
light
body
and
high
carbonation
drinkability
i
regretted
paying
6
dolars
for
this
beer
so
im
not
expecting
one
to
jump
out
at
me
however
this
one
seems
to
do
everything

a
very
good
euro
pale
lager
id
take
any
of
them
over
1664
or
any
french
beer
for
that
matter
the
taste
but
an
underlying
bitterness
kept
pushing
forward
the
feel
was
light
bodied
with
low
carbonation
drinkability
was
fair
all
in
all
and
the
satisfication
factor
is
equally
high
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
and
this
beers
flawed
but
pleasantly
robust
flavor
keeps
it
quite
drinkable
with
a
slightly
bitter
after
taste
there
was
not
much
in
the
way
of
aroma
but
this
was
a
very
drinkable
beer
that
i
will
certianly
buy
again

not
impressed
d
i
remember
enjoying
this
beer
in
the
past
but
i
cant
say
i
enjoyed
the
beer
i
might
have
another
bottle
to
confirm
that
this
bottle
just
hadnt
gotten
super
skunked
if
youre
going
to
drink
a
major
market
lager
this
would
not
be
a
disappointing
choice
the
drink
is
crisp
and
thinbodied
with
good
carbonation
making
it
a
very
easy
drinker
the
beer
was
very
pale
golden
colored
with
a
grainy
smell
but
very
light
on
the
nose
there
is
some
white
head
and
a
bit
of
lacing
the
label
on
the
beer
bought
in
canada
mentioned
glucose
syrup
i
think
that
pretty
much
nails
it
on
the
head
the
beer
had
a
really
bad
adjunct
flavor
to
it
maybe
some
cheap
hop
like
extract
and
a
light
wheaty
maltiness
there
wasnt
heaps
of
taste
to
this
beer
and
when
it
settled
watch
out
the
beer
became
quickly
undrinkable
this
was
really
bad
euro
pale
lager
and
i
cant
think
of
any
reason
to
return
to
it
if
you
like
the
style
there
are
plenty
of
better
macro
euro
style
beers
to
choose
from
recommended
this
is
a
decent
gas
station
beer
and
was
a
good
alternative
to
the
high
cost
of
beer
in
restaurants
in
paris
pours
a
crisp
pale
amber
with
a
decent
frothy
head
that
diminishes
to
a
ring
and
leaves
spotty
lacing
aroma
is
a
slight
bit
of
sweet
malts
and
fruit
but
not
much
else
the
taste
is
a
somewhat
enjoyable
balance
of
sweet
malts
and
citrus
hops
just
not
anything
all
that
special
the
beer
is
light
and
crisp
and
i
wouldnt
guess
its
almost
6
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
not
something
im
likely
to
drink
again
i
pour
this
beer
in
a
pilsner
glass
poured
a
solid
gold
color
it
was
darker
then
i
expected
smell
was
of
hops
but
not
great
the
taste
was
good
shows
good
hop
balance
and
a
bit
of
sweetness
as
well
more
sweetness
then
i
expected
as
well
but
it
was
all
in
balance
with
the
rest
of
the
beer
mouthfeel
was
just
ok
overall
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
another
beer
that
seems
to
go
down
well
should
make
a
good
summer
brew
a
solidly
drinkable
beer
if
only
that
it
is
always
on
draft
in
france
12oz
green
bottle
obtained
at
tiger
town
in
gardiner
pours
a
goldenyellow
body
with
a
good
half
inch
of
nearlywhite
somewhat
rocky
head
that
slowly
dissipates
clinging
to
the
side
of
the
glass
to
create
some
nice
lacing
great
looking
for
a

smells
somewhat
sweet
peppery
some

vegetable
tastes
sweet
sweet
caramel
malt
some
pepper
hints
of
hops
and
dmscooked
vegetable
the
more
i
have
the
better
it
tastes
light
in
body
and
very
drinkable
definitely
could
see
having
a
few
of
these
on
a
hot
day
but
for
the
price
id
probably
go
with
something
domestic
instead
overall
ive
heard
raves
about
this
beer
and
it
doesnt
measure
up
the
sourness
is
unpleasant
and
other
than
that
there
is
nothing
that
jumps
out
at
me
not
worth
the
price
or
the
reviews
oh
et
la
bouteille
très
chic
that
bottle
is
really
stylish
overall
a
slightly
above
average
euro
lager
d
average
i
suppose
to
be
honest
i
probably
wouldnt
go
for
this
again
being
that
the
sea
of
euro
pales
is
a
large
one
not
a
bad
brew
by
any
means
but
its
lacking
some
consistency
that
would
really
help
it
out
das
long
as
i
finish
it
cold
its
pretty
good
and
refreshing
not
bad
for
an
old
french
beer
and
its
nice
to
rate
it
after
all
this
time
much
better
than
its
kronie
cousin
im
rating
the
drinkability
of
this
brew
highly
because
of
how
smooth
and
attractive
the
beer
is
a
light
crisp
beer
like
this
is
delicious
on
a
hot
day
and
is
also
an
excellent
excellent
session
beer
i
personally
like
this
beer
better
on
tap
and
it
would
have
garnered
a
higher
rating
had
i
been
reviewing
it
on
tap
but
its
not
terrible
out
of
the
bottle
either
certainly
an
above
average
green
bottle
beer
d
i
like
it
but
not
enough
to
buy
it
all
the
time

with
a

of

mostly
your
classic

smell
the
flavor
was
actually
more
then
decent
which
suprised
me
a
nice
crisp
clean
feel
gave
way
to
more
then
a
decent
swelling
a
grain
and
hops
with
hints
at
cereals
and
fresh
cut
grass
a
long
subtle
and
dried
out
finish
only
served
to
add
on
to
this
one
and
really
make
a
great
overall
impression
on
me
it
went
down
like
water
and
i
was
suprised
at
just
how
drinkable
this
one
was
overall
i
would
have
to
say
not
bad
at
all
and
i
would
definitly
order
this
one
again
as
for
a

d
nothing
special
typical

overall
the
kronenburg
is
a
solid
beer

is

to
it

from

on

than
anything
else

i
could

for

for

i
am
glad
to
have

more

not

the

i
could
see
the
abv
catching
up
with
me
i
had
this
on
my
airfrance
flight
from
paris
to
munchen
not
a
bad
little
lager
poured
a
bit
more
golden
than
the
typical
pale
lager
with
a
good
head
for
a
plastic
cup
nose
was
a
bit
bready
and
had
a
decent

kick
the
taste
was
a
bit
of
the
same
with
a
good
grassy
noble
hop
flavour
coming
through
the
canned
version
is
much
better
than
green
bottled
one
it
also
helps
that
i
am
close
to
the
source
all
in
all
one
of
the
better
plane
offerings
i
have
had
d
a
below
average
euro
pale
for
me
drinkable
but
probably
wont
buy
again
too
pricey
for
what
it
is
not
bad
but
nothing
i
would
regularly
order
at
a
bar
i
am
not
a
large
fan
of
european
pales
or
french
so
suffice
to
say
kronenbourg
really
surprised
me
i
do
not
like
the
hoppyskunked
taste
of
many
european
beers
of
this
nature
such
as
heineken
and
st
pauli
the
kronenbourg
has
much
less
of
a
bite
and
is
a
little
smoother
to
my
palate
i
would
definitely
not
mind
drinking
a
couple
of
these
in
a
session
from
a
can
exp

yellow

smells

not
a

taste
is

with
some
hoppy
dryness
i
find
the
taste
quite
agreeable
for
the
style
theres
refreshment
value
here
not
a
difficult
beer
to
put
down
in
small
quantities
perfect
after
a
long
walk
on
a
warm
afternoon
or
on
your
way
home
after
work
a
quite
average
euro
pale
lager
with
a
bit
higher
abv
than
i
would
have
expected
nothing
bad
making
this
recommendable
as
this
type
of
beer
but
nothing

redeeming
either

burst
quite
nice
actually
nice
mouthfeel
rather
crisp
all
in
all
quite
a
nice
macro
lager
drinkable
got
this
one
ontap
in
the
fox
and
the
hound
in
philly
mostly
because
id
tried
everything
else
there
it
was
basically
the
same
thing
as
most
standard
euro
pale
lagers
and
not
worth
the
import
price
associated
with
it
color
was
straw
with
a
touch
of
head
nose
was
mild
but
mostly
malt
flavor
was
actually
a
bit
better
malt
and
grain
and
a
very
light
hint
of
hops
at
the
end
feel
was
standard
for
the
style
i
wont
get
this
one
again
although
it
wasnt
as
bad
as
a
heineken
the
best
mainstream
lager
i
have
tried
by
far
this
tastes
fresher
and
more
interesting
than
any
of
the
other
euro
lagers
i
have
tried
it
is
a
little
pricey
but
not
too
bad
value
in
my
opinion
compared
to
the
alternatives
however
some
local
ales
are
cheaper
and
more
interesting
to
taste
im
not
sure
why
theres
such
a
low
score
for
this
beer
id
drink
this
over
any
mainstream
euro
lager
on
the
market
very
very
solid
lager
from
the
french
brewery
from
a
green
bottle
with
a
unique
shape
this
brew
pours
a
rich
gold
color
but
with
a
small
white
head
the
aroma
has
some
hops
and
a
little
grain
its
a
faint
smell
but
fairly
inviting
the
taste
is
light
with
an
mild
herbal
hop
tone
its
not
as
sweet
as
a
lot
of
other
european
lagers
its
light
in
body
and
in
texture
a
touch
of
pale
malt
comes
forth
as
the
brew
warms
the
finish
is
clean
but
a
little
watery
its
a
nice
pleasant
beer
but
thats
about
it
another
ill
pass
i
suppose
it
is
relatively
refreshing
but
im
pretty
sure
id
drink
water
lemonade
or
iced
tea
before
id
consider
another
greenbottled
skunklaced
french
effort
at
refreshment
average
beer
nothing
really
stands
out
nothing
against
it
though
its
a
better
choice
than
most
macros
on
the
market
not
bad
not
great
easy
drinking
euro
lager
not
the
worst
not
the
best
but
it
will
do
i
wish
to
heck
breweries
would
turn
away
from
green
clear
glass
bottles
that
said
this
beer
poured
with
a
large
offwhite
head
sweet
aroma
off
set
with
some
hoppy
bitterness
color
is
a
burnished
brass
flavor
is
pretty
much
like
the
aroma
a
hint
of
being
light
struck
although
the
bottle
isnt
too
near
a
high
energy
light
source
a
bit
of
head
and
lace
lasts
all
the
way
down
decent
body
pleasant
finish
refreshing
and
very
drinkable
session
beer
the
delicate
soft
mouthfeel
from
the
billions
of
tiny
bubbles
is
the
best
part
about
this
brew
and
makes
it
highly
drinkable
i
tried
this
on
june
30
2007
after
purchasing
it
from
my
local
lcbo
store
having
tried
the
kronenbourg
lager
i
decided
to
try
this
the
beer
smoothly
into
the
glass
with
a
nice
light
gold
colour
clear
with
a
thin
head
the
aroma
is
faint
but
malty
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
some
mild
carbonation
the
taste
is
more
hops
than
malt
and
has
a
slightly
bitter
finish
overall
a
decent
beer
that
i
may
try
again
but
i
prefer
the
lager
this
beer
is
reminded
me
from
the
first
sip
of
a
becks
pilsner
malts
in
the
forefront
with
a
light
hoppy
flavor
kroneys
doesnt
have
that
underlying
bite
that
becks
has
a
smoother
malt
flavor
protrudes
if
you
are
looking
for
something
crazy
in
this
beer
pass
on
it
if
youd
like
to
try
decent
import
beer
go
for
it
kronenbourg
is
all
gravy
in
my
books
does
1664
meet
all
my
needs
in
a
beer
no
is
it
what
i
would
drink
in
the
usa
if
i
could
find
it
here
in
western
minnesoa
no
did
it
do
the
job
on
that
unique
warm
day
in
southern
france
with
my
son
under
an
umbrella
blabbing
about
life
waiting
for
my

find
some

having
never
heard
of
this
beer
after
ordering
it
on
tap
nothing
else
worth
trying
at
the
place
i
was
at
i
have
to
say
i
was
disappointed
from
the
getgo
appearance
is
of
your
typical
macro
lite
beer
aroma
was
very
faint
i
did
detect
some
vegetalgrassy
aromas
taste
was
a
hint
of
sweet
malt
with
a
sour
finish
hops
were
almost
undetectable
but
maybe
im
jaded
mouthfeel
was
light
drinkability
is
ok
this
has
a
little
going
on
but
not
a
lot
pours

fades
quickly
to
a

the
taste
also
has
a
good
hoppy
taste
up
front
mostly
in
the
form
of
of
lemon
citrus
but
thats
taken
over
by
an
earthy
malt
flavour
after
a
few
more
sips
the
flavours
seem
to
let
up
and
it
tends
to
lean
on
the
watery
side
but
it
still
isnt
bad
quite
refreshing
so
i
wont
have
any
trouble
finishing
the
6
pack
over
the
next
few
days
overall
another
bland
and
characterless
adjunct
lager
if
this
one
is
an
example
of
the
beers
made
in
france
i
suggest
that
they
stick
with
wine
drinkability
is
high
since
i
had
a
lot
of
these
beers
and
with
a
hot
weather
it
can
increase
da
not
too
jazzed
with
this
frenchimported
offering
d
simple

drink
but
simple
on
flavor
as
well
not
a
very
impressive
showing
but
still
somewhat
decent
looks
good
colorful
golden
served
to
me
with
almost
no
head
and
a
light
lace
smell
was
fairly
weak
i
could
only
pick
up
some
floral
hops
taste
was
favorable
but
average
weak
malt
base
with
an
aftertaste
of
floral
hops
and
light
hints
of
fruit
potentially
citrus
fruits
maybe
orange
there
was
a
slight
taste
of
yeast
as
well
mouthfeel
was
good
a
heavier
body
than
i
expected
and
carbonated
well
leaving
a
hoppy
tingle
on
my
tongue
pretty
good
lager
with
good
character
overall
this
brew
isnt
too
exciting
but
on
one
of
those
days
when
your
just
looking
for
a
nice
refreshment
its
better
than
your
typical
macro

a
try

would

again
kronenbourg

soon
became
a
thin
layer
that
did
manage
to
leave
a
little
lacing
in
the
glass
the
aroma
was
mainly
european
hops
the
taste
was
eurohops
over
a
light

it
was
crisp
and
clean
with

it
was

d
ok
mouthfeel
and
look
but
the
flavour
detracts
which
is
a
serious
problem
in
a
beverage
the
flavour
is
weak
enough
that
you
can
ignore
it
and
get
through

i
found
the
whole

somewhat
unpleasant
ill
avoid

immediately
upon
opening
the

there
is
a
skunky
aroma
that
is
quite
common
among
euro
lagers
grainy
tasting
with
some
skunk
too
not
particularly
good

doesnt

to

a
bit
of
delicate
roasted

noticed
but
over

it
wears
to
become
too
astringent
through

the

become
more
tart

tangy
but
it
all
adds
up
to
an
unlikeable
clash
not
bad
not
good
somewhere
in
the
middle
of
the
beer
void
d
dangerously
drinkable
beer
is
pleasantly
sweet
bitter
enough
to
supply
flavor
and
not

heavy
could
easily
become
the
downfall

for
the
grand
prize
of
the
competition
well
find
out
soon
lawnmower
beer
sure
but
there
are
better
i
actually
bought
this
because
i
had
kronenbourg
1664
blanc
on
tap
when
i
was
in
uk
last
august
for
the
great
british
beer
festival
not
at
the
gbbf
mind
you
i
remember
liking
that
well
enough
but
this
doesnt
hold
a
candle
to
the
blanc
i
wouldnt
mind
finding
that
in
the
states
but
i
probably
wouldnt
buy
this
one
again
the
most
exported
and
most
popular
brewed
beer
in
france
is
kronenberg
1664
made
in
strasbourg
its
an
easy
drinking
lager
akin
to
stella
artois
a
beer
to
not
be
actively
sought
out
but
neither
one
worth
avoiding
sometimes
it
can
be
the
best
there
is
sometimes
the
worst
its
a
pale
lager
with
a
slight
sweetness
to
it
its
a
mile
better
than
the
bud
coors
miller
staples
here
in
the
states
in
france
it
is
everywhere
and
if
you
actively
like
drinking
beer
and
are
there
you
will
drink
it
d
this
is
drinkable
for
sure
would
definitely
try
this
fresh
in
france
if
i
get
the
oppurtunity
as
i
think
any
beer
fresh
close
to
the
source
is
mile
different
to
anything
exported
nevertheless
drinkable
for
the
style
drinkabilitynotes
a
fairly
typical
euro
lager
bland
and
unassuming
a
brown
glass
bottle
would
be
a
distinct
improvement
drinkability
not
a
beer
to
go
out
of
your
way
to
have
typical
mass
produced
european
bland
tasting
lager
this
beer
poured
a
very
clear
straw
color
with
a
nice
head

nice
lacing

good
appearance
it
has
a
sweet
floral
smell
the
taste
is
a
bit
floral
but
other
than
that
lacks
not
much
more
character
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
highly
carbonated
the
drinkability
of
this
one
would
be
ok
because
it
is
fairly
nonoffensive
finishes
crisply
so
makes
a
good
thirst
slaker
but
thats
about
it
inoffensive
d
i
prefer
this
to
most
macro
lagers
from
europe
softer
and
smoother
than
say
warsteiner
or
pils
urquell
highly
sessionable
shining
lighter
golden
color
with
a
nice
frothy

good
lacing
bubbly
smells
really
wet
and
immature
with
some
skunky
notes
and
aluminum
taste
is
decent
at
the
front
but
in
the
end
it
really
loses
appeal
some
kind
of
sulphuric
bitter
finish
kills
any
good
the
beer
might
have
displayed
before
fairly
watery
as
well
i
dont
think
it
was
real
old
just
not
good
for
my
taste
overall
its
one
i
neither
like
or
dislike
have
qualities
to
make
it
drinkable
but
really
nothing
to
make
it
stand
out
but
i
dont
think
i
would
ever
order
it
at
a
bar
other
than
when
in
paris
this
is
a
really
terrible
effort
so
generic
and
boring
i
can
hardly
drink
it
funny
thing
is
in
france
fresh
and
on
tap
it
dosent
seem
like
a
bad
thing
on
a
hot
night
out
too
bad
the
bottle
cant
survive
the
journey
pours
a
pale
golden
yellow
with
a
sticky
white
head
that
leaves
a
good
amount
of
lacing
around
the
glass
i
was
surprised
at
the
appearance
and
lacing
aroma
is
very
lagerish
with
grain
and
a
slight
amount
of
hops
taste
is
pretty
clean
that
starts
malty
and
finishes
with
a
grassy
hop
bitterness
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
lager
nothing
i
am
dying
to
go
out
and
get
again
but
it
is
pretty
decent
doesnt
smell
or
taste
great
but
itll
wash
down
a
burger
just
fine
however
i
must
remark
about
the
bottle
a
styled
green
bottle
embossed
with
1664
and
a
distinct
torpedo
shape
with
the
redwhiteandblue
label
only
covering
the
neck
and
cap
must
be
one
of
the
most
attractive
bottles
ive
ever
found
the
french
may
not
be
a
brewing
powerhouse
but
they
do
have
an
eye
for
design
fairly
smooth
and
refreshing
for
style
occassionaly
i
buy
this
when
in
the
mood
for
a
eurolager
better
than
some
of
the
more
popular
eurolagers
def
a
drinkable
beer
during
the
summer
that
you
can
take
big
sips
of
if
your
really
thirsty
ever
buy
a
beer
and
wonder
later
why
you
bought
it
sure
we
all
have
this
beer
was
one
of
those
for
me
it
poured
well
enough
straw
yellow
with
a
good
head
but
then
the
head
went
away
to
thin
lacing
the
initial
smell
was
skunkiness
i
associate
with
eurolagers
the
taste
was
a
bit
more
than
i
was
expecting
considering
the
smell
mild
malt
with
a
light
hop
background
and
a
relatively
dry
finish
not
bad
summertime
beer
but
i
could
do
better
or
cheaper
for
summertime
swilling
beer
i
could
probably
drink
this
in
quantity
if
it
was
the
beer
on
stock
at
a
party
or
bar
i
have
no
complaints
its
nothing
outstanding
just
a
good
safe
old
standby
a
fair
albeit
lackluster
beer
pours
out
to
a
light
yellow
color
with
a
dense
head
of
white
sealike
foam
some
lace
medium
high
level
of
carbonation
aromas
were
light
and
grassy
some
malt
and
grain
taste
is
acceptable
and
decent
enough
but
doesnt
distinguish
itself
from
any
other
pale
lager
wheaty
notes
attack
the
tongue
with
elements
of
bland
malt
and
smooth
grain
filling
in
the
gaps
with
a
touch
of
floral
hops
and
thats
about
it
mouthfeel
was
good
enough
but
the
lack
of
flavor
and
depth
took
away
from
the
bubblypleasure
that
the
mouth
experienced
drinkability
is
slightly
above
average
not
impressive
but
definitely
drinkable
although
after
it
warmed
up
a
bit
is
was
pretty
skunky
the
taste
is
similar
to
a
warm
heineken
i
e
ratty
no
matter
how
cold
you
manage
to
cool
it
this
beer
also
freezes
quickly
in
a
freezer
the
aroma
is
akin
to
a
skunk
the
head
is
fleeting
the
color
is
dull
and
uninspiring
in
the
glass
and
the
mouthfeel
is
watery
opinion
i
dont
think
that
this
beer
is
nearly
as
average
as
a
lot
of
my
fellow
bas
do
this
is
a
clean
and
wellmade
beer
that
has
a
finish
delicate
enough
to
require
interpretation
this
is
less
hoppy
than
a
pilsner
but
more
so
than
a
helles
i
think
that
it
is
a
pretty
good
beer
and
one
that
i
will
be
dinking
again
overall
a
friend
puts
it
at
a
little
more
refined
miller
high
life
i
find
it
rather
disappointing
perhaps
not
enough
of
the
skunkiness
managed
to
air
out
of
this
bottle
but
it
still
doesnt
have
a
presence
it
seems
more
overwhelmed
by
whats
lacking
than
what
it
brings
to
the
table
i
must
say
that
it
hides
its
neary
6
percent
alcohol
well
for
something
with
as
little
presence
as
this
lager
has
d
i
think
its
a
pretty
good
drink
for
the
style
a
good
sittingaroundwithfriends
beer
or
aftermowingthelawn
beer
overall
the
taste
was
just
too
terrible
to
even
make
having
another
a
possibility
im
usually
pretty
forgiving
but
the
taste
was
just
beyond
bad
dont
bother
with
this
one
clear
yellowgold
with
a
pillowy
head
that
dissipates
all
too
soon
smells
skunky
like
so
many
euro
imports
theres
a
hint
of
mild
bitterness
and
malt
on
the
palate
but
altogether
things
are
quite
light
drinks
easy
light
kind
of
thin
in
other
words
like
a
macrolager
i
would
drink
this
beer
only
under
special
circumstances
such
as
the
one
described
above
or
if
i
went
to
france
and
it
was
available
for
a
nickel
kronenbourg
1664
is
a
pleasant
brew
clean
and
refreshing
there
just
is
not
a
lot
of
kronenbourg
1664
in
nebraska
to
make
my
regular
list
overall
this
beer
is
greatly
lacking
in
character
yellow
piss
color
lighter
than
the
regular
kronenbourg
and
less
skunky
too
although
the
bottles
of
this
stuff
that
ive
had
in
the
states
are
just
ridiculously
skunky
this
one
is
similar
to
busch
but
with
some
of
the
better
aspects
of
stella
mixed
in
for
fruity
measure
finish
is
slightly
acidic
and
hopped
clean
and
crisp
almost
as
good
as
budweiser
the
taste
was
smooth
crisp
and
sweet
definatly
a
hint
of
grassy
hops
the
aftertaste
is
a
bit
dry
nothing
to
significant
i
kind
of
liked
this
beer
nothing
to
insane
nothing
horrible
just
kind
of
refreshing
its
very
similar
to
more
popular
european
lagers
drinkability
pretty
decent
nothing
id
ever
buy
again
but
i
could
slug
the
whole
sixer
down
and
still
enjoy
it
it
poured
a
very
bright
golden
color
and
had
a
medium
sized
dense
head
that
disappeared
quickly
it
had
a
hint
of
citrus
in
the
smell
and
malty
but
not
too
hopy
taste
was
of
light
malt
and
grains
like
rice
it
was
a
pleasent
drink
and
was
had
at
a
nice
little
beach
cafe
in
agde
france
and
that
helped
me
enjoy
teh
beer
more
but
its
nothing
amazing
just
an
average
lager
expected
better
from
the
smell
but
what
are
you
going
to
do
in
my
opinion
there
are
much
better
euro
pale
lagers
out
there
i
wont
be
getting
this
again
pours

enjoyable
a
nice
easy

drinkabilityoverall
easy
to
drink
and
quite
tasty
for
a
macro
this
is
heads
and
shoulders
above
a
lot
pours
light
straw
colored
with
a
nice
foamy
head
actually
looks
rather
like
bud
smells
rather
like
bud
not
surprisingly
tastes
rather
budlike
although
a
bit
lighter
in
texture
and
slightly
very
slightly
citrusy
it
was
ok
did
the
job
surely
the
french
can
do
better
than
this
albeit
now
owned
by
the
brits
i
dont
really
have
anything
bad
to
say
about
this
one
it
seems
it
is
quite
unpopular
and
many
people
dislike
it
but
i
rather
enjoied
it
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
lagers
but
when
i
do
have
one
i
like
it
to
be
like
this
clear
and
straw
in
colour
very
clean
looking
white
head
that
diminishes
after
a
few
minutes
leaving
a
ring
of
lace
around
the
glass
the
smell
and
taste
are
both
fairly
malty
up
front
with
little
else
present
very
very
low
key
stuff
with
only
a
tiny
hint
of
hops
on
the
finish
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
i
thought
it
was
a
great
brew
for
having
several
in
a
row
in
a
social
type
setting
it
most
certainly
isnt
your
delicious
complex
abbey
ale
its
a
consume
in
mass
quantities
while
watching
a
sporting
event
or
in
a
social
setting
brew
ill
buy
it
again
looks
pretty
average
for
a
euro
lager
pours
a
golden
brown
with
a
moderate
head
and
little
lacing
smell
is
mainly
of
hops
with
no
evidence
of
skunk
in
the
least
which
gives
this
beer
good
marks
taste
is
typical
of
other
euro
lagers
smooth
not
overly
bitter
taste
with
a
grainy
finish
carbonation
is
evident
but
not
excessive
bitterness
is
minimal
and
taste
is
actually
rather
pleasing
which
makes
this
a
great
beer
to
have
in
the
fridge
when
youre
feeling
thursty
pours
a
pale
yellow
with
a
thin
head
that
dissipates
very
quickly
and
leaves
no
lacing
smells
grainy
and
bitter
and
the
alcohol
is
palpable
even
though
this
is
a
pretty
modest
beer
in
terms
of
abv
flavour
is
not
impressive
theres
not
much
of
it
and
what
there
is
is
sharp
and
bitter
leaving
a
slightly
rotten
aftertaste
mouthfeel
isnt
terrible
but
isnt
anything
to
get
excited
about
either
being
pretty
watery
on
the
whole
the
aftertaste
is
what
kills
drinkability
for
me
i
was
glad
to
be
finished
the
one
i
had
and
i
just
didnt
want
another
one
afterwards
not
great
but
pleasant
and
refreshing
a
run
of
the
mill
lager
with
enough
qualities
that
i
wouldnt
shy
away
from
it
its
clean
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
good
for
what
it
is
overall
its
an
ok
brew
not
great
but
not
bad
add
this
to
the
list
france
comes
up
short
again
drinkability
an
ok
euro
lager
but
i
just
cant
get
excited
about
the
style
no
its
not
duvel
or
magic
hat
but
its
great
drinkability
means
you
can
serve
it
to
your
mother
your
wife
and
your
friends
at
the
next
tailgate
party
without
another
thought
yes
you
can
even
serve
the
backwash
to
the
slugs
in
your
tomato
garden
if
there
is
anything
left
over
pours
golden
clear
with
a
decent
white
foamy
head
that
fades
relatively
quickly
a
few
sparkling
bubbles
precipitate
but
no
yeast

overall
a

i
wouldnt
buy
this
beer
again
unless
it
was
on
sale
for
really
cheap
it
was
ok
as
a
summer
quencher
but
would
prefer
other
eurolagers
for
this
task
just
didnt
seem
to
be
a
star
in
the
eurolager
world
all
in
all
i
dont
think
this
specific
pour
i
got
is
truly
representative
of
the
beer
the
taste
and
body
are
fine
enough
but
i
wont
order
another
one
here
i
am
fairly
impressed
with
this
beer
i
didnt
really
expect
too
much
after
the
last
beer
i
had
from
france
fischer
traditional
blonde
this
is
actually
a
nice
refreshing
lager
that
has
a
flavour
profile
that
while
not
mind
blowing
is
a
pleasant
switch
from
north
american
macro
lagers
its
actually
pretty
decent
per
style
strong
straw
color
with
loosely
knit
carbonation
and
laced
decently
lightly
malty
and
bready
to
the
smell
less
earthy
and
yeasty
than
a
bohemian
light
hop
aroma
that
boarders
on
light
strickenness
tastes
the
same
bready
and
malty
with
slight
apple
or
pear
flavors
slightly
spicy
from
noble
hop
late
additions
thins
out
in
the
body
and
reveals
a
fresh
alcohol
flavor
and
moderate
graininess
other
than
the
grainy
texture
the
finish
is
crisp
clean
and
lightly
bitter
and
dry
bitter
and
floral
aromas
emerge
from
the
tawny
yellow
trying
again
there
is
roasted
malt
sugar
to
be
detected
caramelized
a
gustatory
image
of
brown
white
bread
crust
is
partially
filled
with
airy
neutral
starch
and
sugar
flavor
there
is
little
suggestion
of
herb
something
absolutely
crucial
here
i
feel
it
ends
in
a
fallen
mess
of
watery
caramel
flavor
no
guts
ironically
had
this
french
brew
while
visiting
norway
what
can
i
say
it
was
there
the
beer
was
light
and
very
clear
served
in
an
appropriately
branded
glass
the
bartender
was
very
persnickity
about
this
lots
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
mouthfeel
was
pretty
good
and
tended
to
have
a
creamy
texture
a
very
long
aftertaste
was
the
only
thing
that
kept
this
from
being
a
superior
brew
easy
to
drink
on
this
warm
afternoon
but
otherwise
nothing
too
memorable
about
it
plus
ive
seen
a
few
reviews
out
there
bashing
american
breweries
american
breweries
like
ommegang
rogue
anchor
steam
etc
are
some
of
the
greatest
beers
the
world
has
to
offer
you
just
have
to
not
buy
your
beer
at
a
local
grocery
store
drinkability
this
beer
leaves
a
lot
to
be
desired
it
is
mildly
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
like
today
but
water
would
be
just
as
refreshing
drinkability
poor
i
didnt
even
feel
like
finishing
this
beer
let
alone
several
i
got
sick
of
it
early
even
though
its
pretty
good
for
the
style
give
me
something
with
a
bit
more
substance
instead
in
a
green
glass
bottle
the
color
is
about
standard
for
a
euro
pale
lager
golden
yellow
head
is
actually
pretty
nicesized
with
some
fluffiness
the
aroma
starts
with
a
quick
whiff
of
skunk
upon
popping
the
cap
after
that
tiny
initiatial
skunk
burst
the
smell
settles
into
a
pleasent
sweet
graininess
the
taste
is
lightly
sweet
with
distinct
graininess
flavor
has
a
nice
balanced
attack
there
is
definently
a
higher
quality
of
flavor
here
than
the
standard
euro
pale
lagers
on
the
shelf
ie
heineken
mouthfeel
is
assertive
enough
to
impress
if
this
were
less
expensive
i
would
find
myself
buying
this
often
in
the
future
good
session
stuff
drinkability
a
good
heavy
drinking
party
starter
i
like
it
it
is
not
exceptionnal
but
it
is
good
enough
to
drink
it
the
beer
pours
a
pale
gold
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
quickly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
pale
malt
scent
that
is
light
yet
malty
i
detect
some
adjunct
use
as
well
as
some
carapils
malts
for
body
and
color
it
also
has
a
dry
skunky
aroma
as
well
the
taste
is
poor
it
is
virtually
tasteless
except
for
some
weak
pale
malt
flavor
and
a
skunky
finish
it
is
another
terrible
euro
lager
from
france
the
mouthfeel
is
average
as
well
it
is
a
low
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
poor
example
of
a
lager
it
has
very
poor
drinkability
its
down
the
drain
with
this
one
pours
out
to
a
golden
color
in
the
glass
with
a
mediumsized
head
very
faint
grassy
aroma
taste
is
decent
albeit
straightforward
with
a
less
of
a
eurostyle
taste
than
i
was
expecting
there
is
a
slight
caramel
and
light
fruit
citrus
present
average
overall
poured
a
clear
amber
yellow
with
a
minimal
amount
of
head
no
real
aroma
to
speak
of
but
the
taste
was
pretty
good

somewhat
hoppy
and
tangy
body
may
have
been
a
bit
thin
but
was
appropriate
for
this
style
a
person
could
drink
a
few
of
these
but
any
establishment
that
carries
1664
would
probably
have
other
tastier
options
also
considering
the
scent
it
tastes
shockingly
average
a
nice
clean
lager
with
nothing
in
particular
either
standing
out
or
detracting
not
a
hint
of
bad
taste
to
be
found
here
a
pretty
good
if
unimpressive
lager
it
pours
a
dark
yellow
the
smell
is
of
ricebread
foams
when
poured
but
the
foam
does
not
linger
not
too
carbonated
a
bit
pricey
in
australia
especially
for
what
it
is
but
ok
much
better
when
on
tap
if
you
find
it
on
tap
give
it
a
try
in
other
words
yet
another
adjunct
lager
ive
seen
worse
one
of
my
friends
claims
this
is
the
best
beer
in
the
world
after
he
came
back
from
france
a
few
years
ago
its
taken
me
quite
a
while
to
find
one
in
the
states
and
was
happy
to
see
it
at
the
paris
las
vegas
hotel
and
casino
i
noticed
lower
reviews
for
this
on
the
site
so
my
expectations
were
not
high
tried
it
our
at
a
fabulous
french
restaurant
in
the
hotel
and
was
very
pleased
with
the
result
it
was
poured
perfectly
in
a
tulip
shaped
glass
that
really
accentuated
the
fruity
and
floral
scent
with
each
sip
much
more
enjoyable
than
expected
and
i
made
sure
to
bring
back
a
few
for
my
friend
finally
the
light
taste
of
this
beer
makes
it
easy
to
take
down
but
as
i
usually
like
to
start
with
a
more
flavorfull
beer
at
first
and
then
i
dont
really
care
what
im
drinking
after
i
call
those
fillers
this
is
a
little
better
than
a
filler
but
not
that
much
my
beer
of
choice
as
i
traveled
accross
europe
4
years
ago
found
it
imported
at
a
store
in
columbus
ohio
but
later
was
unable
to
find
it
it
reminds
me
of
my
great
trip
the
imported
to
us
version
did
not
seem
to
taste
as
good
as
it
did
when
drinking
it
directly
in
france
drinkability

the
only
reason
i
didnt
pour
this
down
the
sink
is
because
i
just
worked
out
and
ate
a
bag
of
funions
so
im
friggin
thirsty
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
dry
pretty
good
drinkabilityeasy
to
have
several
no
real
strong
impressions
here
a
decent
beer
but
really
nothing
special
at
all
smooth
and
refreshing
in
the
mouth
with
nice
even
carbonation
eh
this
stuff
not
all
bad
but
its

ive

ill
forget
kronenbourg
1664
like
it
was
never
here
not
too
bad
of
a
lager
poured
the
typical
light

colour
with
a
light
two

however
the
head
disipated
rather
quickly
kinda
sad
not
much
lace

however
i

the

may

as
well
dry
crisp
mouthfeel
a
refreshing
pale

better
than
expected
better
than

not

either
this
was
a
seriously
strange
smelling
beer
not

any
real
enjoyable
aromas

mon

it

this
has
to
be
the
worst
case
of
skunking
ive
ever
encountered
im
not
kidding
i
had
to
let
it
sit
a
while
to
air
out
gold
in
appearance
with
typical
eurolager
head
flavor
is
very
typical
cheap
continental
light
lager
not
very
exciting
maltiness
and
residual
sweetness
and
noticible
alcohol

sweet
draught
what
to
say
about
this
one
it
pours
a
standard
yellow
with
a
big
white
fizzy
head
there
is
somewhat
of
a
beer
aroma
although
it
is
not
unpleasant
it
has
a
fairly
typical

even
a

it
nondescript

a

the
alcohol
a
little
grains
and
tad
of
citrus
and
some
hops
and
bitter
aftertaste
after
sweet
dries
i
ended
up
at
a
cookout
this
evening
and
there
was
nothing
available
to
drink
other
than
four
kinds

one
of
the

varieties
along
with

swills

budweiser
and
yuengling
light
i
took
this
as
an
opportunity
to
try
beers
i
had
not
tried
in
over
two
years
frankly
i
wish
i
had
just
left
when
i
had
the
chance
to
its
credit
the
kronenbourg
was
the
best
of
the
lot
it
poured
a
dark
yellow
with
a
thick
white
head
the
smell
and
taste
were
akin
to
thin
and
weakly
hopped
soda
water
but
there
was
at
least
a
bite
to
it
it
was
the
only
one
of
the
four
i
did
not
pour
out
after
a
few
swigs
clear
pale
gold
color
with
a
pure
white
head
that
leaves
a
little
fine
lacing
on
the
glass
not
much
in
the
aroma
department
maybe
a
little
grassy
hop
aroma
mild
malt
flavor
with
a
little
hop
bitterness
and
grassy
saaz
hop
flavor
average
mouthfeel
tastes
best
served
very
cold
i
guess
its
ok
but
it
kind
of
reminded
me
of
a
coors
with
a
bit
more
hops
not
a
beer
id
seek
out
reminds
me
of
some
of
the
cheap

us
lagers
i
remember
having
a
bottle
of
this
at
some
outdoor
concert
a
long
time
ago
and
being
less
than
impressed
the
tap
version
is
actually
very
very
good
i
know
my
palate
couldnt
have
changed
that
much
i
dimly
recall
a
sourness
i
really
didnt
care
for
in
the
bottle
probably
skunkiness
or
oxodization
that
i
didnt
recognize
as
such
nothing
that
really
sets
it
apart
from
other
continental
lagers
but
absolutely
no
flaws
either
the
balance
is
right
on
and
i
was
what
might
be
described
as
happy
this
stuff
kicks
the
hell
out
of
more
than
a
few
pilsners
made
by
craft
breweries
good
enough
for
me
clear
pale
gold
under
a
thin
and
shortlived
white
head
that
tried
but
ultimately
failed
to
generate
any
lace
the
nose
is
strong
with
moldy
grain
the
mouth
is
medium
carbonated
and
moderately
heavy
with
sweet
malt
the
taste
is
mild
with
some
malt
tones
at
first
followed
by
a
somewhat
metallic
bitter
finish
the
aftertaste
maintains
that
hoppiness
but
it
is
too
weak
and
therefore
ultimately
inadequate
strasburg

better

when
it
was

of

poured
a
nice

with
a
fluffy

head
and
decent

smell
has
some
grassy
hop
overtones
with
a
bit
of
skunkyness
taste
is
average
for
the
style
perhaps
a
bit
too
hoppy
could
be
better
balanced
standard
euro
pils
clean
and
crisp
but
i
wouldnt
call
it
refreshing
its
drinkable
because
its
just
standard
it
wont
offend
anybody
1664
is
available
almost
every
in

but
it
destroys
many

macros
unfortunately
the
more
i
have
this
the
less
i
like
it
came
to
the

just
a

and
refreshing
this
is
a
simple
good
lager
that
is
a
step
up
from
popular
imports
like
heineken
it
did
a
great
job
of
washing
down

backs
this
then
would
be
the

in
that
slick
green
bottle
which
i
think
is
a
nice
touch
its
a
clear
golden
in
colour
a
fizzled
out
head
thats
not
even
worth
mentioning
really
crisp
grain
and
honey
on
the
nose
backed
by
floral
grassy
hops
flavour
also
possesses
that
crisp
grainbready
character
rounded
out
nicely
with
light
herbal
hops
smooth
and
crisp
it
has
a
thirstquenching
mouthfeel
very
easily
made
into
a
session
ale
and
one
of
my
new
favorite
lagers
im
pretty
impressed
as
id
sampled
this
first
a
year
ago
and
it
never
left
much
of
an
impression
on
me
at
the
time
it
is
what
it
is
and
that
would
be
a
clean
drinkable
lager
with
some
character
this
is
a
review
of
the
uk
brewed
canned
version
of
this
stuff
it
loses
points
on
appearance
as
i
drank
it
straight
from
the
can
the
aromas
are
all
adjuncts
and
grains
with
some
slight
floral
hops
and
light
bready
malts
in
the
mix
the
taste
is
exactly
like
the
aromas
hint
grainy
the
mouthfeel
is
very
light
and
watery
and
the
drinkability
is
not
the
best
this
is
a
great
eurolager
in
bottles
in
the
us
but
in
cans
in
the
uk
it
is
no
better
than
bud
thx
poured
out
of
the
can
a
pale

with
a

head
that
left
lots
of
lacing
on
the
glass
a
slight
smell
of
malt
some
bitter
hops
to
the
aftertaste
but
nothing
to
get
really
excited
about
very
thin
and
almost
too
close
to
watery
for
my
taste
im
not
too
crazy
about
this

i
was

someones
home
in

i
would
accept
it

im

why

the

is
the
most
inetresting
thing
about
this

this

bad
i
wont

writing
about
this

this

at
the
local

an
amber
color
with
a
medium

that
dies
off
quickly
poured
into
the
kronenbourg

the
aroma
is
a
little
grassy
but
some
malts
are
detectable
as
well
there
is
a
faint
sweetness
as
well
this
one
drinks
a
whole
lot
easier
than
expected
i
expected
it
to
be
somewhat
skunky
since
thats
my
experience
with
french
beers
but
it
was
very
good
drinkability
was
good
and
the
mouthfeel
was
very
pleasing
the
finish
is
dry
and
leaves
a
bit
of
the

on
the
palate
on

poured
into
a
kronenbourg
1664
glass
it
pours
a
light
gold
color
with
one
finger
of
head
that
dies
down
to
a
small
collar
quickly
there
is
a
good
amount
of
lacing
left
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
fairly
light
and
grassy
with
a
bit
of
hops
the
taste
starts
malty
and
just
a
little
bit
grassy
and
ends
with
a
crisp
hop
bite
not
bad
for
a
lager
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
light
and
oily
the
drinkability
is
fairly
good
though
a
nice
solid
pale
lager
wheaty
and
very
but
nicely
and
controllably
bitter
this
beer
does
a
nice
tasty
effect
that
proves
it
is
at
least
somewhat
elaborate
this
beer
is
brewed
in
the
largely
germanic
alsacelorraine
region
of
france
but
even
with
the
germanic
roots
it
comes
out
a
unimpressive
beer
it
was
somewhat
easy
to
drink
but
this
beer
really
didnt
do
much
for
me
at
all
simply
put
its
just
another
skunky
euromacro
dull
this
is
not
a
bad
lager
at
all
there
is
nothing
spectacular
about
it
mind
you
but
it
is
pleasant
very
refreshing
and
highly
drinkable
golden
pour
with
a
medium
head
absent
nose
almost
no
detectable
aromas
very
very
very
dull
taste
not
much
in
the
way
of
flavour
purely
a
smooth
and
creamy
beer
easy
drinking
no
taste
nice
mouthfeel
howvever
and
i
think
its
a
decent
but
not
good
summertime
beer
marvelously
clear
golden
color
with
a
modest
fleeting
head
that
leaves
little
remnants
to
lace
the
glass
light
grainy
smell
with
some
pleasant
grassiness
maltysweet
taste
is
better
than
i
expected
and
is
complemented
by
a
smooth
not
sharp
hoppiness
mouthfeel
is
clingier
than
i
prefer
in
such
a
light
beer
but
this
one
excels
in
smooth
refreshing
drinkability
my
dad
went
to
switzerland
last
week
and
brought
me
back
this
with
all
the
good
beers
in
europe
he
brings
me
back
this
served
in
a
16
oz
can
this
brew
poured
a
golden
pilsnerlike
color
with
a
very
large
head
aroma
was
pretty
skunky
either
this
went
bad
on
the
trip
over
or
it
just
smells
bad
all
the
time
however
no
skunk
in
the
taste
basically
just
a
low
quality
rice
beer
flavor
with
a
little
sweetness
from
the
middle
through
the
finish
not
bad
but
not
something
to
stuff
your
suitcase
full
of
on
the
way
back
to
the
states
thats
for
sure
one
of
the
best
features
about
this
beer
for
both
my
sake
and
for
the
brewers
sake
is
the
abv
taste
is
just
mediocre
light
malty
beginning
with
a
hoppy
cushion
and
finishing
weakly
the
same
poured
a
straw
yellow
just
like
any
macro
with
a
big
head
that
didnt
last
long
then
came
the
skunkiness
why
would
they
use
a
green
bottle
i
let
it
sit
for
5
minutes
and
the
skunk
disappeared
aroma
of
malt
of
floral
and
citrus
taste
was
slightly
sweet
with
a
little
of
the
citrus
and
a
little
bit
of
a
hoppy
finish
overall
it
was
plain
and
wouldnt
buy
again
clear
bright
gold
appearance
bigbubbled
and
fizzy
head
that
powers
down
in
about
40
seconds
but
leaves
nice
and
delicate
lace
sulfur
aroma
right
up
there
with
a
st
pauli
girl
also
a
sense
of
grassiness
simple
malt
profile
but
with
an
off
note
of
white
vinegar
what
puts
me
off
is
an
unsettling
finish
a
combination
of
too
much
carbonation
and
a
leafy
cilantro
herbiness
with
a
world
of
beer
out
there
i
have
no
intention
of
drinking
this
again
looks
nice
though
this
beer
poured
a
very
clear
golden
color
the
big
fluffy
white
head
fell
quick
and
left
a
nice
lace
on
the
glass
i
really
liked
the
smell
of
this
beer

it
has
a
pungent
lemongrassy
hop
aroma
to
it
the
beer
is
highly
carbonated
and
has
a
light
body
there
is
an
oiliness
left
in
the
back
of
the
throat
somewhat
reminiscent
of
maybe
ballantines
xxx
ale
finishes
well
easy
to
drink
not
bad
one
of
my
friends
fathers
buys
this
stuff
by
the
case
so
i
decided
i
had
to
try
it
first
off
interestingly
shaped
bottle
but
it
could
do
without
being
green
never
a
good
sign
it
poured
straw
yellow
with
a
fair
sized
head
that
was
retained
for
a
long
time
probably
around
two
thirds
of
the
glass
the
smell
was
a
tad
bit
swillybut
there
was
some
sweetness
and
complexity
that
i
did
not
expect
the
taste
was
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
liking
i
think
i
could
feed
hummingbirds
the
consistency
was
a
little
thin
as
well
overall
i
cannot
complain
the
bottle
decieves
you
but
it
tastes
more
like
some
belgian
pales
than
most
swill
you
would
find
in
a
green
bottle
drank
this
in
paris
clear
golden
forming
a
thin
white
head
atop
small
to

bubbles
retention
is
ok
lacing
is
good
aroma
is
light
with
a
corn
smell
and
lacking
any
hops
mouthfeel
is
very
wet
and
soft
with
a
thin
body
making
it
very
easy
to
drink
carbonation
is
mild
taste
is
light
fruity
at
times
with
a
corn
beginning
a
palemunich
malt
middle
a
champagnelike
yeastiness
and
a
very
mild
bittering
hop
finish
with
a
dry
mouthfeel
decent
and
easy
to
drink
but
not
very
distinct
average
european
lager
pours
a
golden
colour
with
good
carbonation
topped
by
a
thin
head
that
disappears
quite
easily
i
could
detect
spices
and
bitter
hints
in
the
taste
nothing
special
in
the
aroma
goes
down
quite
easily
nice
lager
beer
to
enjoy
with
your
stake
color
is
clear
golden
yellow
with
a
white
foamy
head
that
faded
quickly
leaving
some
patchy
ring
lace
and
changed
to
a
weaker
consistancy
as
it
went
along
smell
is
faintly
bright
floral
hops
and
pale
malt
grain
taste
is
bittering
hop
piney
and
clearing
throughout
and
has
some
grain
malt
that
sits
there
and
does
nothing
feel
is
a
lighter
fared
medium
body
with
a
somewhat
unpleasant
piney
hop
sting
that
remained
bitter
the
whole
way
through
needs
some
help
but
isnt
all
that
bad
poured
a
gold
color
with
not
as
much
head
as
u
might
think
for
the
style
kind
of
a
maltybread
like
smell
but
not
much
to
ittaste
was
kinda
skunky
but
the
smell
wasnt
so
i
think
it
was
the
natural
taste
realy
nothing
special
here
i
wouldnt
buy
again
for
sure
this
lager
from
strasbourg
france
has
some
german
influence
though
with
its
own
dry
french
twist
lively
pale
gold
in
color
with
a
fluffy
snowwhite
head
light
the
edgy
raw
maltiness
balances
nicely
with
a
semiwild
and
raw
resinous
hoppiness
fair
floral
hop
nose
great
beer
for
a
hot
summer
day
think
becks
but
less
metallic
taste
less
sulfur
in
the
nose
and
a
tad
more
noticeable
alcohol
whiff
the
french
can
brew
good
beer
the
green
glass
bottle
with
the
large
fancy
neck
label
pours
a
clear
goldenamber
with
a
shortlived
bigbubbled
head
that
drops
readily
to
a
thin
collar
it
leaves
a
decent
amount
of
lace
upfront
but
retains
lessandless
as
you
progress
through
the
glass
the
aroma
is
highly
skunky
but
ill
ignore
that
as
a
fresh
bottle
should
be
more
neutral
but
theres
a
touch
of
dimethyl
sulfate
as
well
dms
cooked
corn
that
cant
be
ignored
its
minor
but
detracting
it
does
however
express
some
grainy
maltiness
thats
nice
and
a
touch
of
floralherbal
hoppiness
shows
up
in
the
background
the
body
is
medium
with
a
fine
carbonation
that
leaves
it
crisp
in
the
mouth
the
flavor
is
mainly
of
a
grainy
malt
although
there
are
some
light
floral
hops
involved
a
firm
bitterness
balances
and
it
finishes
dry
with
a
light
residual
malt
and
some
nice
hops
the
flavor
of
this
beer
is
just
bitter
and
boring
it
has
a
bready
taste
and
light
malt
flavors
but
it
just
does
not
have
complexity
for
me
body
is
light
and
a
bit
crisp
it
is
just
unimpressive

wears
the
pants
in
this
beer
hops
are
well
subdued
i
could
only
be
wishing
it
but
it
seems
this
brew
has
a
manifest
franconian
quality
to
it
that
sets
it
apart
from
your
typical
eurolagers
interesting
and
worth
a
try
drinkability
notes
very
refreshing
as
i
could
put
down
more
than
just
a
couple
simple
and
clean
with
a
kick
of
hops
and
slight
slap
of
alcohol
this
one
brings
back
memories
and
i
am
glad
they
are
making
an
other
push
into
the
us
market
as
this
puts
other
mass
produced
eurolagers
to
shame

it
is
an

but
nothing
special
it
was
everywhere
in

it
was

flavor

mouthfeel
is

nothing
very
remarkable
here
but
a

this
beer
should
be
reviewed
two
different
ways
when
i
drank
this
beer
in
france
it
was
hoppy
sweet
and
just
the
right
carbonation
i
thought
it
was
fantastic
i
get
back
home
and
buy
a
six
pack
i
end
up
dumping
5
of
them
is
the
american
palate
that
bad
or
do
the
french
hate
us
that
much
sweet
fizzy
and
yellow
that
should
say
enough
but
ive
got
to
write
more
to
complete
my
rating
doesnt
really
have
anything
which
distinguishes
it
from
other
mainstream
lager
and
its
very
boring
to
drink
rather
strong
hops
bitter
aftertaste
when
my
friend
brought
this
over
from
my
local
specialty
carry
out
i
at
first
cringed
france
has
never
been
seen
as
a
beer
country
this
beer
was
a
typical
light
tan
lager
color
a
slight
aroma
of
hops
a
slight
sweet
taste
i
tried
this
beer
on
st
patricks
day
parade
the
saturday
before
the
holiday
i
had
seen
the
bottle
several
times
before
but
never
tried
it
i
highly
recommend
trying
this
beer
its
definitely
worth
the
bottle
as
a
souvenir
the
only
thing
cool
about
the
bottle
is
using
it
for
crafts
but
the
drink
itself
is
horrible
even
if
you
like
a
light
fizzy
beer
o
average
this
beer
smells
like
someone
put
roadkill
in
a
bathroom
there
is
no
aftertaste
i
think
its
trying
to
be
a
peroni
but
it
doesnt
live
up
to
that
nothing
too
special
would
pick
up
again
for
some
summer
drinking
just
go
get
a
rack
of
pbr
lucky
buddha
enlightened
beer
brewed
by
the
lucky
drink
company
with
an
abv
of
4
8
this
brew
pours
out
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
nice
white
head
this
brew
has
the
look
of
american
lager
the
smell
is
sweet
with
some
grains
and
malts
not
much
to
the
smell
of
this
brew
the
taste
is
rich
with
flavor
you
pick
up
on
grains
in
the
taste
of
this
brew
lucky
buddha
enlightened
beer
has
a
nice
balance
to
it
there
is
nothing
overpowering
about
this
brew
the
mouthfeel
of
lucky
buddha
enlightened
beer
is
rich
smooth
and
refreshing
i
like
how
smooth
this
brew
goes
down
this
is
nice
drinking
brew
overall
im
giving
lucky
buddha
enlightened
beer
a
4
out
5
i
would
buy
this
brew
again
thank
you
the
lucky
drink
company
overhyped
but
still
a
nice
tasting
beer
and
bottle
creates
conversation
ive
had
a
lot
worse
the
bottle
is
sick
besides
that
its
a
shitty
beer
take
a
picture
then
leave
it
be
this
one
is
really
bad
smells
like
a
urinal
would
rather
has
a
heineken
the
bottle
is
awesome
but
the
beer
within
is
skunky
and
not
so
good
buy
it
pour
it
out
and
use
the
bottle
for
something
else
i
took
one
sip
and
passed
it
on
to
someone
else
pour
it
out
dont
drink
it
o
very
bad
beer
in
a
very
good
looking
bottle
this
is
a
cheap
heineken
great
bottle
though
this
pours
a
clear
dark
yellow
color
with
a
slight
head
the
aroma
is
very
grainy
the
taste
is
light
and
grainy
very
drinkable
but
not
very
flavorful
imagine
a
weak
tsngtow
its
just
not
my
thing
all
flash
no
flavor
makes
a
budweiser
look
smell
and
taste
like
a
craft
beer
the
lions
share
of
this
rating
comes
from
the
bottle
itself
which
was
bought
solely
for
the
purposes
of
adding
it
to
a
friends
beer
bottle
collection
the
only
good
part
about
this
beer
is
the
bottle
light
crisp
and
refreshing
fun
bottle
i
like
this
style
of
beer
not
alot
of
hop
smells
like
cream
corn
and
bong
water
the
taste
is
slightly
less
offensive
a
euro
pale
lager
is
what
it
is
its
very
light
and
no
hop
but
its
not
skunky
and
nothing
offensive
nothing
great
but
not
bad
either
cool
bottle
keep
the
bottle
toss
the
beer
tastes
like
an
extremely
watered
down
apple
cider
buy
it
for
the
bottle
pawn
the
rest
off
to
your
drunk
friends
horrible
beer
gifted
to
me
at
christmas
the
smell
alone
told
me
that
id
be
pouring
it
down
the
drain
took
one
sip
and
moved
on
great
bottle
very
typical
euro
lager
im
not
sure
i
could
tell
the
difference
between
this
beer
and
most
of
the
other
green
bottle
lagers
that
are
widely
available
it
goes
well
with
stir
fry
or
when
you
need
a
conversation
piece
at
a
party
very
light
not
much
flavor
but
about
what
i
expected
im
new
to
ricebeer
it
is
noticable
i
could
drink
this
if
the
price
was
much
lower
on
a
hot
day
on
the
boat
really
cool
bottle
bought
it
in
a
mix
n
match
and
it
was
worth
it
for
the
bottle
alone
tastes
like
skunky
miller
lite
i
bought
it
for
the
cool
bottle
a
very
poor
beer
practically
water
but
not
offensive
this
was
just
beer
there
wasnt
anything
particularly
good
or
bad
about
it
the
bottle
is
great
and
makes
it
worth
buying
at
least
once
but
only
once
okay
the
bottle
is
really
really
cool
the
beer
isnt
good
not
much
taste
okay
the
bottle
is
really
really
cool
the
beer
isnt
bad
enough
to
be
a
1
but
its
very
weak
tasting
and
is
better
as
a
second
or
third
beer
something
to
have
when
your
taste
buds
are
a
little
numb
buy
it
for
the
bottle
which
is
currently
on
my
shelf
and
buy
it
only
once
overall
its
thin
and
does
not
pack
too
much
flavor
however
if
you
are
drinking
this
you
are
probably
at
a
chinese
food
restaurant
and
the
sweet
flavor
goes
well
with
salty
food
even
worse
than
heineken
i
bought
this
because
the
bottle
is
just
that
cool
as
for
the
beer
it
has
a
european
american
adjunct
and
japanese
rice
beer
vibe
it
starts
with
that
euro
skunky
malt
cereal
grain
corn
sweetness
and
rice
like
finish
its
a
very
light
tasting
and
light
feel
so
you
can
drink
a
ton
transparent
pale
golden
body
with
a
quarter
inch
of
white
head
rapidly
ascending
effervescence
aromas
of
adjuncts
corn
yeast
maybe
its
me
but
im
not
getting
the
nirvana
supposedly
found
in
this
beverage
maybe
its
at
the
bottom
of
the
glass
i
dont
think
i
have
the
willpower
to
drink
that
much
reminds
me
of
heineken
one
of
the
best
tasting
beers
ive
had
in
a
long
time
goes
great
with
any
kind
of
food
tastes
like
zen
clean
pure
a
hint
of
sweetness
and
nicely
carbonated
very
hard
to
find
but
well
worth
the
search
better
than
tsing
tao
not
a
bad
summer
beer
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
light
clean
not
much
taste
or
aftertaste
innocuous
it
reminds
me
of
heineken
except
without
the
skunkiness
very
light
colored
not
much
flavor
moderate
carbonation
beer
gives
a
nice
happy
buzz
i
began
with
a
heavyhanded
pour
since
i
was
anxious
to
empty
the
bottle
and
begin
rubbing
the
buddhas
belly
for
good
luck
this
resulted
in
two
fingers
of
dense
puffy
rocky
bonewhite
head
with
good
retention
it
began
to
fall
as
i
rubbed
leaving
behind
some
nice
lacing
color
was
a
pretty
strawyellow
srm
2
4
with
nequality
clarity
nose
had
a
light
grassiness
which
i
can
appreciate
just
so
long
as
corn
is
not
also
present
as
an
adjunct
something
was
slightly
off
with
respect
to
the
nose
but
corn
did
not
seem
to
be
the
cause
mouthfeel
was
kind
of
thin
and
watery
approaching
medium
the
taste
was
kind
of
grassy
with
a
slight
tartness
but
as
long
as
no
corn
was
evident
i
was
happy
i
have
been
mislead
before
and
not
been
happy
as
a
result
finish
was
semidry
with
a
light
maltiness
to
go
with
its
inherent
grassiness
i
found
it
pleasant
and
probably
a
good
candidate
for
a
lawnmower
beer
enlightenment
was
now
mine
o
lucky
buddha
is
a
mediocre
pale
lager
at
best
worth
picking
up
one
for
the
bottle
but
i
would
not
buy
again
this
is
a
decent
light
asian
lager
that
goes
well
with
any
style
chinese
food
final
thoughts
lucky
buddha
is
a
difficult
beer
to
rate
for
taste
on
the
one
hand
it
is
bland
and
on
the
other
hand
there
are
no
big
flaws
so
basically
it
is
an
okay
beer
as
far
as
adjunct
lagers
go
i
try
to
judge
a
beers
merit
on
how
it
fits
within
the
style
of
course
there
are
better
pilsners
ones
made
with
actual
malt
but
lucky
buddhas
not
bad
for
a
beer
that
had
to
travel
half
way
around
the
world
for
me
to
taste
it
would
i
drink
it
again
perhaps
it
would
be
a
great
gimmick
at
a
party
overall
this
is
not
the
beer
i
expected
to
come
from
buddhas
belly
poured
from
an
interesting
green
11
2
oz
bottle
has
a
very
pale
yellow
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
very
skunky
dont
know
if
its
the
green
bottle
behind
this
or
not
taste
is
not
skunky
in
fact
its
pretty
light
and
mild
some
grains
a
hint
of
sweetness
some
malts
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
overall
not
terrible
but
a
little
lacking
in
the
flavor
department
o
to
me
this
is
not
worth
buying
another
six
pack
this
pennies
just
ok
all
in
all
i
would
definitely
buy
this
again
if
im
having
people
over
or
want
to
show
up
somewhere
with
an
interesting
six
pack
there
is
nothing
i
dont
like
about
this
beer
except
that
i
can
only
find
one
store
in
indiana
that
sells
it
the
gimmicky
bottle
drew
me
in
but
the
light
refreshing
taste
stole
my
heart
im
not
a
fan
of
dark
beers
and
i
do
like
a
bit
of
lime
or
lemon
in
some
i
was
never
a
real
beer
drinker
until
last
year
a
friend
started
turning
me
on
to
different
imported
beers
i
found
that
i
just
cant
really
tolerate
domestic
beers
any
longer
the
next
thing
i
new
im
a
bit
of
a
beer
snob
i
came
across
lucky
buddha
and
was
intrigued
by
the
bottle
i
purchased
some
and
took
it
home
now
this
beer
snob
has
another
brew
to
add
to
his
list
of
faves
it
has
a
smooth
taste
and
lets
face
it
the
bottle
is
pretty
cool
lucky
buddha
was
a
disappointment
for
me
the
bottle
intrigued
me
and
i
bought
a
sixer
when
i
popped
the
cap
on
the
first
one
the
immediate
skunky
smell
caught
my
attention
i
got
past
the
stale
odor
and
gave
it
a
shot
the
beers
flavor
matched
perfectly
with
the
smell
my
next
thought
was
that
the
beer
was
old
or
had
been
repeatedly
chilled
and
warmed
i
am
sure
the
beer
sells
pretty
well
due
to
the
bottle
shape
but
i
suggest
that
anyone
interested
in
this
beer
by
a
single
first
i
am
not
sure
if
i
caught
a
bad
six
pack
or
that
was
the
actual
flavor
being
aimed
for
the
skunky
notes
are
offputting
but
the
overall
background
is
pretty
decent
its
heineken
without
the
aftertaste
very
solid
summer
beer
light
crisp
and
nice
finish
great
beer
to
bring
to
a
party
or
an
event
its
funny
to
sit
back
and
watch
people
react
to
the
bottle
side
note
my
girlfriend
likes
it
quite
possibly
just
because
of
the
bottle
final
grade
2
55
a
crappy
c
the
only
thing
lucky
buddha
beer
really
has
going
for
it
is
the
bottle
and
since
i
dont
need
more
than
one
of
these
i
sincerely
doubt
ill
ever
purchase
it
again
the
flavours
are
not
overtly
offensive
and
that
is
the
best
praise
i
can
come
up
with
not
the
worst
chinese
beer
ive
ever
had
but
id
still
take
tsingtao
over
this
stuff
pass
o
overall
this
is
pretty
much
spot
on
for
the
style
light
crisp
easy
drinking
and
somewhat
boring
rings
true
to
character
and
every
now
and
then
you
have
to
have
one
beats
budlight
i
picked
a
six
pack
up
at
world
market
mainly
because
the
bottle
is
cool
it
is
your
typical
greenbottle
lightstruck
lager
from
asia
weak
and
watery
with
a
slightly
skunky
smell
it
probably
would
go
perfect
with
a
36
at
your
local
chinese
takeaway
the
alcohol
is
a
whopping
4
8
not
sweet
and
easy
to
drink
a
forgettable
beer
nice
bottle
though
overall
sort
of
standard
runofthe
mill
american
lager
cool
bottle
but
not
quite
as
cool
contents
just
decent
overall
this
isnt
terrible
there
are
much
better
examples
of
the
light
lager
style
hence
the
rating
its
made
in
china
so
i
suppose
i
have
to
hope
there
isnt
some
additive
that
will
kill
my
dog
the
second
i
breathe
on
him
but
otherwise
it
is
decent
the
novelty
bottle
is
cute
and
certainly
an
eye
catcher
on
the
shelf
otherwise
worth
trying
once
but
i
cant
see
many
going
back
for
more
i
am
copying
these
notes
over
from
ratebeer
it
does
not
require
as
long
of
review
i
tasted
this
some
time
ago
so
i
cant
add
anything
pours
a
strawyellow
in
color
with
a
very
thin
white
head
some
light
spotty
lacing
was
seen
the
aroma
is
of
some
sweet
corn
and
maybe
rice
grains
but
that
is
about
it
slight
skunky
as
is
super
common
for
beers
in
a
green
bottle
for
some
reason
the
taste
is
actually
more
complex
though
lightbodied
with
a
light
sweetness
from
the
corn
and
rice
grains
no
bitter
or
harsh
aftertaste
to
speak
of
perfect
carbonation
overall
the
cool
embossed
bottle
is
a
keeper
and
worth
that
extra
half
a
point
higher
rating
i
gave
this
one
which
was
included
in
the
rating
pours
a
light
straw
yellow
color
with
a
white
short
lived
frothy
head
a
bit
of
lace
is
left
on
the
glass
aroma
of
creamed
corn
husk
and
clean
euro
like
malts
the
taste
is
much
the
same
bready
corn
flake
flavor
and
scarce
leafy
hop
light
sugary
body
and
real
sweet
overall
not
too
bad
not
good
either
simple
review
for
simple
average
beer
nice
bottle
its
a
keeper
the
beer
not
so
much
low
c
clear
gold
with
lots
of
carbonation
action
actually
leaves
pretty
decent
sheets
of
lace
after
that
its
just
a
low
brow
cheaply
made
beer
could
be
any
one
of
a
dozen
anonymous
chinese
or
american
adjunct
brews
feh
presentation
packaged
in
a
custom
green
glass
bottle
shaped
like
the
buddha
served
in
a
new
belgium
brewing
chalice
pours
a
one
finger
white
head
that
fades
quickly
to
a
thin
layer
leaving
no
lace
crystal
clear
straw
color
good
carbonation
and
very
light
bodied
sweet
adjunct
nose
and
flavor
is
similar
with
slightly
sweet
corn
and
grains
should

mowing
lawn
and
not
while
critically
reviewing
4
04
for
a
330ml
bottle
from
the
quad
las
vegas
nv
weak
bodied
watery
undercarbonated
slightly
drying
this
is
basically
a
somewhat
more
flavorful
version
of
any
megabrew
light
adjunct
lager
nothing
to
recommend
it
o
poor
very
poor
i
wouldnt
recommend
this
to
even
a
macro
lager
drinker
avoid
o
dont
waste
your
money
on
the
cool
bottle
poured
a
clear
yellow
with
no
head
not
impressive
at
all
but
honestly
i
have
never
seen
an
aal
with
a
good
head
or
good
appearance
period
scents
of
lager
yeast
and
crystal
malt
with
some
grain
about
what
id
expect
from
the
style
flavor
is
light
with
crystal
malt
lager
yeast
grassy
flavors
sweet
grain
and
some
slight
hop
presence
again
pretty
standard
but
not
bad
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
high
carbonation
true
to
aal
form
not
a
bad
american
adjunct
better
than
most
american
versions
ive
tried
its
superior
to
the
big
3
maybe
not
as
drinkable
as
pabst
but
okay
o
we
all
know
why
i
bought
this
one
for
the
bottle
i
couldnt
finish
it
not
terrible
for
the
style
it
sure
beats
some
other
bud
products
miller
lite
etc
o
aside
from
appearance
this
was
not
highly
enjoyable
i
will
say
that
if
you
enjoy
collecting
beer
bottles
this
is
a
nice
addition
to
your
collection
i
cannot
recommend
the
consumption
of
the
contents
within
said
bottle
od
not
a
bad
lager
smooth
and
not
adjuncty
decent
enough
o
this
beer
has
a
nice
aroma
of
a
good
kolsch
but
the
flavor
just
doesnt
follow
through
it
has
an
odd
flat
flavor
which
is
the
only
way
i
can
really
describe
it
almost
like
club
soda
without
the
carbonation
i
remember
buying
a
bottle
of
this
a
few
years
ago
because
of
the
unusual
bottle
design
i
then
found
myself
repeating
such
an
endeavor
again
this
week
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
pale
straw
topped
by
a
finger
of
lightly
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
wild
rice
sweet
biscuit
light
corn
and
sweet
flowers
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
a
prevarication
between
sweetness
and
mild
funkiness
created
throughout
the
body
is
fairly
light
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
watery
feel
overall
a
slightly
mediocre
little
lager
nothing
close
to
special
or
even
memorable
beyond
the
bottle
gets
an
extra
5
points
in
appearance
from
me
for
the
kickass
bottle
in
all
other
respects
smell
taste
mouthfeel
this
beer
is
a
near
clone
of
rolling
rock
there
taste
of
adjunct
is
much
less
about
corn
and
more
about
rice
otherwise
this
is
a
good
beer
to
knock
back
with
friends
with
bbq
or
pizza
or
chinese
takeout
not
one
you
have
to
think
a
great
deal
about
in
terms
of
complexities
or
subtleties
pours
a
very
pale
straw
yellow
topped
with
a
thin
white
head
that
actually
leaves
some
lacing
on
the
glass
but
its
minimal
aromas
are
nothing
to
be
desired
grain
grass
metallic
not
much
else
tastes
are
rather
bland
with
grain
corn
cereal
grassy
hop
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
watery
with
moderate
carbonation
overall
its
at
most
average
for
the
style
no
better
and
no
worse
than
most
of
the
macrolagers
out
there
already
easy
to
drink
and
with
that
european
aroma
and
flavor
and
a
very
mild
skunk
aroma
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
corn
flake
flavor
on
the
finish
there
is
a
slight
metallic
flavor
that
i
am
getting
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
low
level
of
carbonation
with
an
almost
flat
mouthfeel
overall

a

here
if

i
would
think
that
this
beer
is
a

blonde

ale
what
i
think
is
most
likely
is
that
the
beer
has
aged
it
is
actually
just
inside
useby
but
has
been
stored
in
a
warm
room
throughout
the

low
hop
bitterness
this
works
fine
as
a
thirst
quencher
but
is
still
a
very
plain
adjunct
lager
i
did
not
see
much
difference
from
their
amstel
light
a
really
great
pilsener
classic
one
of
the
best
industrial
options
in
the
market
o
a
standard
euro
pale
lager
balanced
and
quite
quenchable
this
and
amstel
light
were
my
import
beers
of
choice
when
i
was
younger
and
i
was
limited
to
imports
back
in
the
states
as
much
as
they
have
some
bad
reviews
they
bring
back
nostalgia
and
i
would
still
rather
drink
them
over
grolsch
and
heineken
it
was
given
to
me
in
an
amstel
glass
there
was
just
the
right
amount
of
head
and
the
lace
had
retainability
over
its
transparent
body
the
aroma
was
crisp
with
mild
sweet
malt
tones
the
flavor
is
average
for
this
style
basic
crisp
pils
style
lager
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
watery
the
curiousity
is
cured
but
my
mouth
would
like
a
different
beer
next
amstel
lager
might
just
be
a
novelty
item
for
american
tourists
like
me
who
thankfully
cant
get
this
version
stateside
o
this
beer
is
a
basic
pilsener
but
it
is
very
easy
to
drink
mediumlight
in
texture
theres
the
tendency
to
want
to
read
higher
level
of
fullness
due
to
the
slightly
more
substantial
malt
balance
and
residual
grain
sweetness
but
the
body
is
light
and
refreshing
to
complement
island
foods
well
but
in
subsequent
session
the
timid
hop
balance
leaves
the
beer
unsupported
and
the
sweetness
fatigues
the
palate
quicker
than
a
lighter
beer
should
do
good
for
what
it
is
i
suppose
drinkability
is
high
if
you
dont
get
a
headache
amstel
and
heineken
for
that
matter
always
reminds
me
of
wannabe
beer
snobs
for
some
reason
thanks
for
bringing
this
back
from
south
america
sister
better
than
the
really
standard
stuff
on
tap
places
but
not
sure
i
would
pick
it
over
other
popular
ontap
beers
here
in
south
africa
peroni
etc
i
dont
know
i
used
to
like
it
when
i
was
younger
but
now
it
would
be
my
last
choice
among
the
other
dutch
commercial
beers
ill
give
it
a
high
overall
mark
just
for
all
those
moments
we
spend
together
o
typical
euro
lager
makes
heineken
taste
good
overal
a
decent
macrolager
as
long
as
it
is
on
tap
overall
a
bit
chemicaltasting
but
much
cleaner
and
crisper
than
the
standard
pale
lager
is
it
the
can
vs
green
bottle
is
it
being
in
europe
vs
the
us
considering
it
is
cheaper
than
most
similar
spanish
lagers
it
is
a
clear
step
above
o
drinkable
but
forgettable
marginally
better
than
the
standard
sab
lagers
available
in
south
africa
of
all
the
beers
i
had
in
holland
the
pint
of
amstel
i
had
after
a
hot
summer
day
of
walking
through
amsterdam
for
the
first
time
is
still
one
of
the
most
memorable
and
not
memorable
for
the
wrong
reasons
it
was
cold
clean
ordinary
and
refreshing
what
more
could
i
ask
of
it
it
would
be
far
from
the
best
beer
i
had
that
trip
but
it
did
the
trick
when
called
upon
a
very
typical
beer
i
purchased
this
often
in
europe
because
it
was
cheaper
then
most
while
still
offering
a
drinkable
liquid
pours
a
little
head
that
dissapates
quickly
does
not
taste
very
good
at
all
but
is
still
doable
if
there
is
a
shortage
of
options
andor
money
heineken
is
probably
a
little
better
but
not
by
a
long
shot
i
really
genuinely
love
this
stuff
it
has
a
good
taste
and
is
very
refreshing
also
unlike
fosters
it
doesnt
smell
like
stale
urine
taste
light
easy
to
drink
slight
saaz
hop
feel
to
it
not
discernably
different
than
the
light
version
we
get
in
the
states
uplifting
refreshing
just
enough
caramel
to
it
overall
pricy
but
one
of
the
more
enjoyable
beers
in
the
style
have
no
idea
why
it
isnt
available
in
the
states
nothing
groundbreaking
but
sometimes
were
in
the
mood
for
an
easy
drinking
lightly
hopped
beer
dr
affordable
but
garbage
dont
waste
yer
time
with
this
one
lads
grab
a
pacifico
instead
at
this
price
range
a
very
standard
pale
lager
everyone
knows
what
these
lagers
are
about
have
some
and
watch
a
game
with
some
friends
d
not
the
best
euro
lager
out
today
httpabarwithnoname
wordpress
com
d
dont
think
i
couldnt
drink
more
than
a
24oz
of
this
stuff
would
only
drink
this
if
my
options
were
terrible
or
if
i
was
given
some
free
at
a
party
much
better
than
the
ghastly
light
version
poured
with
a
huge
foamy
frothy
sudsy
fluffy
white
head
that
lasts
and
lots
of
lace
color
is
a
clear
yellow
gold
with
some
bubble
trails
aroma
is
a
mild
skunk
hop
malt
flavor
is
more
bitter
than
sweet
but
still
not
a
lot
there
body
is
ok
and
so
is
carbonation
finish
is
like
flavor
and
short
drinkable
beer
if
other
options
arent
so
good
this
beer
is
pretty
blah
but
it
has
no
off
weird
flavors
so
it
goes
down
easy
on
a
hot
day
this
beer
is
huge
in
greece
it
was
everywhere
had
it
a
few
times
on
draft
in
rythmno
crete
kind
of
a
soft
delicate
aroma
and
flavor
nothing
mindblowing
but
quite
nice
there
was
a
lasting
flowery
impression
from
the
gentle
hops
granted
it
was
overall
not
a
really
exciting
beer
but
it
exceeded
my
expectations
quite
a
bit
not
really
super
nice
as
easy
to
drink
beer
but
because
it
has
a
fairly
feeble
bitterness
and
especially
an
insignificant
price
levels
flavors
this
is
a
stupid
european
lager
unpretentious
which
differs
from
other
models
by
an
aftertaste
a
bit
suret
and
somewhat
artificial
to
suggest
that
the
egg
a
little
acid
not
really
relevant
to
a
true
beer
lover
d
this
is
a
great
summer
beer
and
even
a
good
spring
beer
pretty
refreshing
with
a
nice
beery
taste
no
nonsense
a
solid
euro
pale
that
i
drink
a
lot
of
here
in
bulgaria
drinkability
water
is
drinkable
i
guess
overall
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
a
couple
of
notches
above
its
cousin
heini
worth
the
weight
on
a
hot
sunny
day
d
average
drinkability
for
a
euro
pale
lager
as
this
sits
at
around
45
abv
the
head
is
very
nice
after
i
poured
the
bottle
in
a
dutch
vase
the
beer
is
best
when
its
cooled
in
a
fridge
cheers
stay
clear
of
it
theres
hundreds
of
beers
more
worthy
of
the
name
out
there
overall
not
my
favorite
pilsner
but
way
better
than
hollands
most
famous
pilsner
heineken
i
really
dont
like
the
metallic
taste
in
this
beer
but
after
being
forced
to
drink
amsterlite
before
the
match
this
is
way
better
not
a
beer
for
the
connoisseur
but
a
decent
cheap
lager
nevertheless
not
a
whole
lot
to
say
about
this
beer
i
had
it
at
the
airport
in
athens
and
it
really
wasnt
anything
especially
good
or
bad
it
is
similar
to
heineken
with
a
less
bitter
finish
and
aftertaste
and
more
sweet
malt
carbonation
is
pretty
high
and
the
body
is
mediumthin
watery
and
weak
feeling
to
this
beer
not
impressed
at
all
i
remember
this
beer
before
amstel
was
taken
over
by
heineken
it
has
gone
down
hill
since
those
days
in
the
1970s
d
this
beer
isnt
very
exciting
but
i
enjoyed
it
for
what
it
is
i
hate
to
keep
comparing
it
but
it
reminds
me
a
lot
of
heinekin
its
saturday
night
so
i
think
i
will
have
another
cheers
lightly
bodied
and
more
watery
than
some
other
lagers
no
better
or
worse
than
heineken
for
example
but
not
good
either
a
good
example
of
the
eurolager
style
md
the
palate
comes
slightly
too
fizzy
and
becomes
a
bit
watery
in
the
end
although
the
body
doesnt
fall
too
thin
overall
this
bulgariabrewed
amstel
is
a
pretty
bland
offering
but
i
thank
my
dear
flatmate
for
her
kindest
gesture
all
the
same
pours
with
a
reddish
tinge
to
its
yellow
a
little
white
head
taste
is
corny
a
tad
of
carmel
mostly
astringent
to
me
very
thin
mouthfeel
and
a
couple
of
ounces
is
too
much
very
light
carbonation
smell
is
neutral
thanks
for
bringing
mr
russev
not
too
good
this
dutch
brew
comes
in
a
nice
looking
bottle
and
pours
a
clear
yellow
a
short
lived
head
is
light
beige
and
fizzy
the
nose
is
quite
dull
but
possibly
has
some
grassy
malts
the
taste
is
of
stale
bitter
hops
with
a
subtle
grain
presence
body
was
light
with
lot
sof
carbonation
just
another
well
marketed
lager
r
not
impressed
i
cant
seem
to
get
any
good
beers
on
this
vacation
aftertaste
is
short
and
fruity
probably
very
drinkable
to
those
who
just
want
a
refreshing
brew
not
interesting
enough
to
keep
my
interest

characteristic
of
american
lager
new
in
my
country
recommendable
75
my
parents
bought
this
back
from
aruba
much
better
than
the
amstel
light
we
have
here
and
i
dont
even
think
that
is
so
bad
subdued
golden
color
with
decent
carbonation
lightly
hopped
actually
very
refreshing
since
you
can
taste
hops
and
not
all
grain
like
other
lagers
of
this
variety
this
actually
isnt
half
bad
at
all
smooth
and
drinkable
nothing
earthshattering
but
a
pleasent
surprise
this
beer
pours
a
nice
golden
yelloworange
color
with
about
one
finger
worth
of
pale
white
head
it
smells
a
bit
tart
and
malty
it
has
a
mildy
bittertart
taste
very
good
its
sort
of
like
a
less
bitter
actual
dutch
heineken
which
is
a
good
thing
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
good
with
plenty
of
carbonation
id
say
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
though
id
have
to
go
to
holland
again
to
get
more
please
note
this
review
is
of
the
amstel
bier
available
in
holland
not
the
amstel
lager
export
variety
my
cousin
went
all
the
way
to
austria
and
brought
this
back
live
and
learn
731
a
pretty
dull
euro
lager
overall
it
seems
nothing
special
but
it
is
capable
of
quenching
your
thirst
on
a
hot
day
the
head
and
aroma
were
on
par
with
each
other
teetering
on
nonexistance
not
possessing
an
abundance
of
flavour
the
taste
is
typical
of
european
macrobrewed
quaffs
the
aftertaste
is
slightly
better
and
may
be
the
best
thing
amstel
has
going
for
it
and
can
be
described
as
dry
and
slightly
bitter
i
cant
honestly
say
i
hated
it
but
i
cant
recommend
it
either
and
whats
worse
is
ive
got
one
bottle
left
of
this
nasty
stuff
shockingly
bad
beer
theres
only
one
thing
i
can
truly
say
about
this
brew
that
is
worth
knowing
i
didnt
know
they
would
bother
to
brew
a
vb
equivalent
overseas
but
here
tis
a
total
stinker
this
is
even
worse
than
oranjeboom
there
is
no
doubt
amstel
is
the
worst
imported
euro
lager
going
around
bad
and
even
beneath
that
i
found
amstel
to
taste
very
similar
to
heineken
not
the
same
just
similar
the
main
selling
point
of
this
beer
in
australia
is
its
price
a
box
24
bottles
of
amstel
is
a30
while
a
box
of
heineken
is
closer
to
a50
with
this
price
difference
my
pick
is
amstel
one
of
the
most
known
beers
around
but
yet
one
of
the
least
impressive
i
dont
know
in
other
countries
but
here
in
cyprus
because
so
few
people
are
really
interested
on
beer
they
consider
it
one
of
the
best
i
totally
disagree
nothing
special
to
offer
good
not
great
a
rather
plain
tasting
beer
but
that
doesnt
mean
that
its
bad
either
has
a
decently
strong
flavor
without
being
too
heavy
boring
beer
which
tastes
like
heineken
just
another
lager
really
boring
as
hell
but
i
suppose
you
could
drink
it
draft
in
a
pilsner
glass
pours
a
golden
amber
with
little
head
clean
and
clear
traditional
lager
done
right
well
balanced
hops
not
bitter
smooth
easy
drinking
nice
summer
beer
good
effort
o
overall
pleasant
drinkable
and
refreshing
but
i
think
i
would
pass
this
one
by
for
others
in
similar
styles
blue
mountain
produces
consistent
decent
beers
and
this
is
no
exception
poures
into
a
becker
a
dull
light
goden
with
a
half
finger
bone
white
head
atop
that
leaves
a
few
broken
globs
of
lace
behind
as
it
settles
grainy
with
a
light
smack
of
herbal
hobs
in
the
nose
but
its
pretty
clean
quite
dry
on
the
palate
with
a
decent
crispness
and
pretty
full
feel
a
good
after
work
beer
and
will
go
good
in
my
homemade
german
sausage
iam
making

i
began
by

a

a

i
was
shocked
to
see
croesus
midas

mammon
appear
but
it
was
just
that
golden
usually
they
canfine
themselves
to
my
kitchen
nose
had
a
clean
maltiness
not
fouled
by
unwanted
adjuncts
along
with
a
light
grassy
hoppiness
mouthfeel
was
soft
and
the
interplay
between
the
malt
and
hops
was
just
what
i
am
looking
for
in
a
lager
nothing
pretentious
or
over
the
top
just
a
nice
clean
beer
finish
was
semidry
with
the
grassiness
coming
to
the
front
i
was
glad
to
have
tried
it
even
in
a
field
setting
and
i
would
have
it
again
if
the
situation
called
for
a
canned
lager
oan
aboveaverage
but
not
extraordinary
lager
id
go
with
their
kolsch
over
this
one
over
all
i
like
this
beer
but
will
probably
not
have
it
again
unless
it
is
offered
to
me
it
is
nothing
spectacular
just
a
solid
beer
that
is
worth
trying
but
now
that
i
have
had
it
probably
wont
purchase
again
an
easy
drinker

rather

this

is

it
really
did
the
trick
after
a

at

extremely
smooth

and
completely
drinkable
theres
no

head

leaves
some
wisps
of

with
perhaps
some

toasty
munich

a

and
some

not

bad

be
a
bit
more
fresh

in
the

reminiscent
of
a

a
try

down
in

drinkability
easy
to
drink
this
beer
not
overly
exciting
it
does
hit
the
spot
on
a
hot
day
they
tried
way
too
hard
to
come
up
with
that
name
it
pours
a
clear
pale
straw
topped
by
about
a
finger
of
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
light
wheat
and
some
light
citrus
hops
the
taste
holds
notes
of
light
wheat
greens
and
a
vague
floral
bitterness
the
body
is
light
with
a
lightish
carbonation
and
a
crisp
dry
finish
overall
a
decent
pale
lager
but
nothing
special
this
is
a
solid
local
offering

it
great
again
its
grainy
mild
bitterness
due
to
hops
hops
lend
a
faint
piny
note
balanced

its
not
overly
complex
but
solid
enough
to
return
to
over
and
over
if
you
just
want

this
is
your
ticket
this
is
one
local

thanks
to
mntlover
for
my
first
blue
mountain
brew
this
is
definitely
a
good
beer
for
drinking
on
a
hot
sunny
day
as
it
goes
down
very
easily
an
above
average
pale
lager
md
i
think
this
is
an
ok
brew
from
blue
mountain
not
my
favorite
but
im
glad
i
got
to
try
it
it
might
have
been
my
bottle
it
seemed
way
overcarbonated
and
took
forever
to
get
it
into
my
glass
notes
from
and
tasted
on
021908
d
an
excellent
allmalt
lager
the
style
given
here
is
off
this
beer
has
tons
of
body
and
is
better
tasted
when
the
temperature
can
be
controlled
and
not
overly
cold
to
enjoy
the
grainy
and
noble
hops
goodness
d
drinkability
is
good
this
beer
actually
went
down
easy
and
quick
i
would
have
no
problem
at
all
haveing
some
more
of
these
overall
i
felt
this
beer
was
well
balanced
and
very
easy
to
drink
the
beer
pours
a
nice
golden
color
with
a
12
white
head
that
quickly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
nice
pale
malt
scent
along
with
a
dry
bisquitey
lager
yeast
aroma
the
taste
is
good
also
it
has
a
smooth
pale
malt
flavor
that
goes
down
a
little
sweet
and
finishes
dry
and
clean
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
adequategood
carbonation
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
lager
its
all
malt
and
easy
drinking
a
wonderful
beer
drinkability
is
just
fine
this
beer
is
what
it
is
which
is
a
decent
small
brewery
craft
lager
and
i
wouldnt
have
any
problem
at
all
taking
a
six
pack
or
two
of
it
to
a
party
d
could
be
a
touch
high
in
abv
for
some
but
i
would
certainly
treat
this
as
a
session
brew
quite
good
for
its
class
and
fortunately
its
a
local
brewery
it
serves
as
a
good
respresentative
of
its
style
the
flavor
is
of
sweet
malt
a
little
graininess
and
the
distinctive
profile
of
noble
hops
there
is
a
hint
of
bitterness
in
the
finish
but
it
is
very
slight
the
noble
hop
flavor
however
lingers
several
minutes
beyond
the
swallow
the
first
few
sips
reveal
a
slight
fruitiness
but
the
firm
maltiness
and
noble
hop
flavor
soon
overpower
the
fruitiness
this
is
an
excellent
lager
reminiscent
of
a
fine
munich
helles
i
picked
this
up
around
christmas
of
2013
at
the
heb
in
mcallen
texas
there
was
nothing
special
to
it
and
it
is
one
of
the
pourest
beers
from
belgium
it
poured
golden
was
cloudy
with
a
soapy
head
and
lots
of
carbonation
it
tasted
like
any
other
massed
pale
ale
with
a
watery
taste
little
edge
low
alcohol
content
and
not
filling
o
imo
stella
serves
a
similar
purpose
to
corona
and
might
benefit
from
a
lime
while
i
say
that
i
should
mention
that
this
is
definitely
a
superior
beer
to
corona
and
im
not
knocking
either
beer
in
any
way
stella
artois
is
by
no
means
the
best
beer
i
have
ever
had
but
it
is
pretty
good
nontheless
stella
is
a
highly
carbonated
golden
yellow
beer
with
an
oddly
metallic
taste
it
has
a
champagnelike
appearance
at
times
i
find
it
acceptable
in
the
same
circumstances
as
other
pale
lagers
however
it
is
not
something
i
prefer
by
any
means
while
leagues
ahead
of
domestic
counterparts
i
feel
that
stella
artois
is
a
budweiser
or
corona
of
europe
if
youre
expecting
complexity
this
is
not
a
good
beer
for
you
it
is
simple
thin
crisp
and
sparkly
a
very
full
body
and
rich
beer
overall
the
appearance
of
it
is
a
light
yellow
color
with
the
smell
being
a
sweet
earthy
and
almost
faint
smell
the
taste
is
crisp
and
refreshing
for
a
beer
and
overall
very
tasty
mostly
a
mans
beer
but
a
good
beer
overall
none
the
less
i
would
for
sure
buy
this
at
a
bar
or
in
store
even
enjoy
stella
report

a

ask
me
no
not
really
this
is
what
i
drink
for
the
beach
not
too
few
or
out

this
is
better
than
anything
here
in
costa
aside
a
rare

this
includes
the

the
visual
is

the

there
is
nothing
more
to

and
mouthfeel
out
beat
any
male
prostitute
looks
better
than
my
piss
i
finalize
this
retort
the
overall
this
beer
is
drinkable
maybe
not
likeable
but
its
drinkable
pretty
descent
beer
pretty
smooth
with
a
light
white
head
to
it
the
taste
is
probably
slightly
average
but
then
in
finishes
sweet
and
leaves
you
feeling
satisfied
i
can
see
girls
being
attracted
to
this
kind
of
beer
it
starts
out
slightly
too
bitter
but
then
gets
better
its
a
good
beer
when
its
around
cheap
beers
because
they
make
this
beer
taste
great
compared
to
them
drinkability
light
crisp
refreshing
drinkable
but
not
very
interesting
good
in
its
category
good
beer
for
watching
sports
and
snacking
belgian
in
origin
but
not
at
all
representative
of
the
regions
preferredfamous
style
this
pale
golden
lager
with
a
thick
lace
does
manage
to
stand
out
among
the
plethora
of
mainstream
lagers
out
there
the
scent
is
almost
floral
a
definite
spicy
hoppy
sharpness
and
presence
the
taste
follows
this
with
more
complexity
and
depth
than
similar
brews
not
half
bad
and
a
solid
step
inbetween
mainstream
and
craft
beer
the
taste
is
probably
slightly
under
average
but
then
in
finishes
sweet
and
leaves
you
feeling
satisfied
its
supposedly
a
girly
beer
but
i
dont
think
many
girls
would
appreciate
it
it
starts
out
slightly
too
bitter
but
then
gets
better
its
a
good
lightly
above
average
beer
when
nothing
interesting
is
around
good
drinkablity
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
and
would
recommended
to
someone
that
hasnt
tried
it
yet
d
easy
to
put
down
but
not
calling
me
back
from
the
taste
drinkability
is
drinkable
because
its
a
light
beer
but
would
drink
other
beers
instead
served
from
tap
into
a
weizen
glass
pours
a
golden
yellow
with
one
finger
white
head
maintained
excellent
lacing
throughout
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
wheat
and
citrus
the
flavor
was
of
citrus
and
slight
malt
it
was
light
on
the
palate
with
low
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
very
refreshing
brew
not
my
favorite
brew
ive
had
but
definitely
not
the
worst
this
is
the
one
i
go
with
for
a
lighter
brew
when
the
other
options
are
not
good
this
is
an
amazing
pale
lager
from
europe
this
is
a
great
beer
if
you
are
a
fan
of
european
style
lagers
it
is
really
light
in
color
and
it
is
smooth
a
good
summer
beer
the
only
down
side
to
the
beer
is
it
s
scent
because
it
smells
a
little
burnt
aside
from
the
smell
it
is
a
nice
refreshing
pale
lager
i
understand
it
seems
a
lot
of
people
in
this
website
like
strong
heavy
beers
so
if
thats
the
case
i
guess
this
is
not
it
for
you
but
to
me
this
beer
is
perfect
although
light
and
airy
this
beer
has
a
very
bad
after
taste
to
it
the
appearance
of
it
is
good
if
poured
correctly
the
head
usually
is
about
12
and
inch
thick
smell
is
very
desireable
but
i
personlly
can
not
sit
and
enjoy
this
beer
like
i
would
with
other
ones
of
its
style
start
here
but
move
on
kids
drinkability
easy
going
but
pretty
nondiscript
stella
is
quite
possibly
the
worst
beer
ive
ever
had
it
looks
fine
has
a
mediocre
nose
and
the
mouthfeel
is
nothing
to
write
complaints
about
the
taste
however
is
where
this
brew
fails
miserably
approaching
the
average
aspects
of
its
presentation
otherwise
appearance
nose
one
would
expect
something
smooth
with
little
to
write
home
about
frankly
i
expected
this
beer
to
be
drinkable
the
flavor
is
so
off
it
makes
me
wonder
what
they
used
to
brew
it
it
couldnt
have
been
barley
for
i
cant
find
a
hint
of
those
flavors
the
hops
are
no
where
to
be
seen
tasted
or
smelled
this
brew
fails
with
flying
colours
has
a
stinky
smell
to
it
that
can
be
off
putting
a
little
skunky
smell
color
is
pale
yellow
with
a
small
onefinger
head
loads
of
bubbles
taste
is
average
but
a
little
different
than
what
i
expected
its
got
an
almost
buttery
flavor
with
hints
of
pepper
with
some
lemon
zest
beer
is
better
on
tap
than
in
a
bottle
d
we
drank
this
stuff
like
water
years
ago
guess
its
an
ok
rep
for
the
style
but
it
wont
end
up
in
my
cart
again
this
beer
pours
a
pale
yellow
colour
with
an
average
one
finger
fluffy
head
that
fades
slowly
with
hardly
any
lacingit
smells
quite
funky
really
like
off
watery
hopsit
has
a
below
average
mouthfeel
and
just
tastes
like
watermalty
hops
nothing
really
too
it
hereand
its
funny
too
cos
in
australia
this
is
considered
as
a
big
euro
beer
which
usually
goes
for
60
a
carton
or
more
so
yeah
i
definately
cant
see
what
all
the
fuss
is
about
with
it
definately
not
for
me
fairly
priced
and
goes
down
smooth
so
it
could
be
sessioned
easily
this
beer
has
a
very
offensive
odor
that
dominates
its
otherwise
mediocre
to
poor
qualities
taste
is
very
bland
and
skunky
one
of
my
least
favorite
beers
drinkability
i
might
have
a
few
with
some
food
but
i
would
not
drink
this
by
itself
its
a
pretty
good
brew
and
its
probably
best
had
with
food
its
not
a
beer
that
id
take
on
by
itself
really
it
goes
well
with
bbq
foods
and
pizza
overall
a
pretty
good
restaurant
beer
goes
great
with
most
food
and
is
highly
drinkable
one
of
the
better
lagers
over
all
i
would
rank
it
an
average
beer
not
something
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
but
if
its
there
i
dont
mind
drinking
it
d
i
dont
want
to
drink
anymore
of
these
it
gave
me
a
stomach
ache
its
so
bad
got
this
from
lcbos
beligan
beer
gift
set
pours
pale
gold
with
about
a
two
finger
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
smell
is
fairly
standard
for
this
style
lager
with
a
malty
accent
a
bit
of
spice
up
front
with
a
little
bite
to
it
in
the
end
minimal
lacing
this
beer
is
very
well
balanced
but
i
found
it
not
suprisingly
to
be
fairly
watered
down
very
refreshing
and
very
quaffable
but
like
most
people
say
the
price
is
too
high
for
this
standard
lager
presently
on
tap
at
the
house
and
drinking
one
right
now
definetly
much
better
on
draft
than
bottle
very
decent
pour
beautiful
creamy
head
even
in
a
plastic
cup
very
nice
the
beer
has
a
nice
golden
appearance
definitely
not
a
heavy
european
lager
a
bit
on
the
light
side
not
bitter
at
all
would
recommend
this
one
to
someone
looking
to
get
away
from
domestics
and
into
the
european
market
not
bad
for
a
mass
marketed
inexpensive
european
watery
mouthfeel
nice
carbonation
best
part
of
the
beer
and
dry
aftertaste
a
place
that
serves
this
probably
also
serves
more
appealing
alternatives
go
for
the
alternative
i
cant
complain
about
this
beer
wasnt
anything
exceptional
but
it
also
wasnt
a
bad
beer
either
had
a
spicy
taste
in
front
of
a
crisp
wheet
taste
smell
was
kind
of
grainy
appearance
was
golden
yellow
with
a
3
cm
foam
head
pure
white
mouthfeel
was
crisp
sort
of
wattery
though
very
drinkable
though
finished
a
tall
of
it
with
some
salmon
for
dinner
yes
its
a
good
drinkable
beer
completely
overpriced
though
ok
at
best
had
this
sitting
in
the
fridge
for
a
few
months
dont
remember
how
it
got
there
which
is
not
a
good
sign
checked
the
freshness
dating
and
its
still
ok
pours
pale
straw
with
fluffy
white
head
little
retention
bit
of
skunk
in
the
nose
but
just
slightly
tastes
malty
a
little
bitter
and
some
background
sweetness
but
overall
dull
and
dry
and
a
bit
metallic
crisp
drinker
for
the
pseudotrendy
bar
crowd
and
how
trendy
that
is
for
me
to
say
this
is
better
than
carlsberg
and
kronenbourg
thats
the
best
i
can
say
for
it
i
drank
alot
of
it
when
i
lived
in
london
for
a
few
months
in
bottles
it
is
inconsistent
sometimes
skunked
but
on
draft
its
smooth
the
corn
taste
isnt
too
bad
and
its
really
cheap
a
good
session
beer
if
you
arent
out
to
really
pay
attention
to
what
you
are
drinking
its
drinkable
just
not
memorable
its
been
a
while
since
a
had
a
beer
so
boring
i
kept
forgetting
it
was
sitting
in
front
of
me
never
again
the
only
thing
that
i
was
dissapointed
with
was
the
smell
which
was
pretty
bad
there
wasnt
much
head
and
no
lace
to
go
along
with
it
there
was
thin
thin
thin
lacing
that
wasnt
sticky
either
it
went
down
really
smooth
and
was
pretty
solid
for
a
euro
pale
lager
dont
drink
and
review
eric
stella
is
simply
a
very
drinkable
beer
in
bottles
and
even
more
so
ontap
if
youre
not
looking
for
anything
overly
interesting
exotic
or
exciting
side
note
before
i
said
this
would
not
get
you
hammered
i
had
16
oz
with
a
big
meal
and
i
weigh
about
240lbs
abv
is
listed
at
5
90
on
this
site
assuming
thats
true
and
i
have
seen
them
change
ratings
before
then
this
may
get
you
hammered
pretty
quick
after
all
if
you
have
to
have
a
beer
and
are
driving
this
isnt
the
one
stella
is
a
great
beer
to
start
off
with
in
life
its
light
approachable
you
can
drink
a
handful
of
them
i
love
stella
because
its
great
with
everything
and
its
hard
for
people
not
to
like
if
youre
looking
for
a
mindblowing
beer
dont
buy
stella
but
i
like
it
served
in
a
pilsner
glass
tastes
big
brand
sure
have
this
if
you
want
bland
but
cheap
fucking
tasty
beer
i
enjoyed
it
one
of
my
favorite
beers
a
standard
everywhere
the
smell
is
alright
but
i
can
see
some
not
enjoying
the
skunkiness
still
a
classic
though
rated
from
previous
tasting
notes
i
would
say
that
stella
and
heineken
are
both
very
good
entry
level
beers
for
people
who
think
they
dont
like
beer
i
started
with
those
two
just
a
year
or
so
ago
and
now
im
learning
to
appreciate
the
gulden
draaks
the
pauwel
kwaks
the
eku
28s
and
the
samichlaus
type
beers
this
is
why
i
still
like
it
a
lot
and
its
my
go
to
because
most
places
arent
going
to
have
the
previously
mentioned
beers
good
belgian
beer
very
light
subtle
aromas
smooth
and
refreshing
taste
very
light
in
appearance
as
well
as
taste
nothing
stood
out
in
terms
of
taste
smooth
delicious
summer
beer
honestly
its
the
best
for
summer
bbqs
great
belgian
but
i
never
noticed
before
this
app
that
there
is
no
smell
only
bad
feature
very
good
beer
with
great
taste
smooth
finish
and
best
when
on
draft
this
stuff
isnt
bad
but
it
is
not
nearly
as
good
as
it
needs
to
be
to
justify
its
high
price
id
honestly
rather
drink
pabst
than
this
and
itd
cost
me
much
less
overall
its
ok
but
way
overpriced
light
bodied
light
carbonation
better
than
i
expected
not
something
i
will
actively
seek
out
but
will
drink
this
in
absence
of
more
desirable
beers
delicious
straight
up
delicious
only
bad
part
is
price
but
it
is
one
of
the
best
beers
ever
great
with
pizza
like
a
rolling
rock
if
a
rolling
rock
was
any
good
but
still
basically
that
very
pale
very
clear
flavor
is
plain
lager
o
this
is
a
beer
that
would
go
well
with
anything
and
nothing
at
all
if
not
pairing
with
anything
then
it
becomes
more
of
a
summer
beer
in
my
opinion
very
light
and
will
not
fill
you
up
3
255
decent
lager
nothing
special
lots
of
bubbles
easy
to
find
lager
its
a
clear
golden
color
and
has
a
slight
skunk
smell
its
a
crisp
light
beer
with
a
good
hoppy
taste
upfront
there
is
a
clean
finish
at
the
end
its
a
solid
beer
in
the
style
that
i
like
love
the
taste
and
look
of
it
this
is
the
go
to
light
pale
euro
lager
although
i
will
only
purchase
it
on
sale
a
little
too
pricey
if
not
on
sale
look
is
pale
amber
with
a
white
head
and
a
little
lacing
smell
is
a
pleasant
hopped
aroma
taste
is
similar
very
light
good
mouthfeel
not
heavy
at
all
a
good
dinner
beer
goes
with
most
everything
without
the
aftertaste
you
get
with
some
american
pilsners
not
the
best
but
when
your
unsure
of
which
euro
light
lager
to
pick
up
you
cant
go
wrong
with
it
i
like
the
packaging
but
a
very
underwhelming
beer
tastes
like
something
from
a
college
kegr
overpriced
when
marlon
brando
famously
exclaimed
stellaaaaaa
in
the
classic
film
on
the
waterfront
he
was
almost
certainly
not
talking
about
this
beer
stella
the
woman
is
classy
sexy
playful
firm
stella
the
beer
is
not
shes
gassy
shes
tasteless
shes
haughty
for
her
age
and
level
of
sophistication
i
get
it
shes
foreign
but
if
shes
bad
in
the
hop
sack
i
dont
see
the
point
of
coming
back
for
seconds
at
the
end
of
the
day
stella
is
eminently
forgettable
and
doesnt
hold
a
candle
to
a
nice
american
girl
of
a
similar
price
great
smooth
good
after
taste
good
beer
little
pricey
for
what
youre
getting
some
domestics
are
quite
better
and
cheaper
excellent
smooth
beer
one
if
my
favorites
this
is
a
truly
awful
beer
super
skunky
bottle
of
stella
artois
drank
a
very
light
beer
with
not
much
flavor
ok
beer
not
great
but
good
perhaps
not
worth
the
elevated
price
but
a
satisfying
european
pale
lager
with
a
pleasant
finish
and
aftertaste
its
a
decent
lager
in
the
style
of
what
you
would
expect
but
its
just
boring
unless
with
certain
food
pairings
i
like
it
with
fish
frothy
head
medium
body
and
a
pleasant
but
mild
noble
hop
aroma
its
a
sessionable
beer
and
one
that
has
a
hint
of
sweetness
towards
the
end
if
youre
a
fan
of
lagers
this
should
be
a
beer
that
should
be
on
your
tasted
list
one
of
the
great
european
beers
always
a
decent
dinner
beer
its
light
and
crisp
very
drinkable
light
tasting
crisp
refreshing
all
n
all
decent
beer
the
perfect
hoppy
lager
beer
its
basically
a
tastier
version
of
heineken
and
you
dont
need
much
to
be
tastier
than
a
heineken
a
little
better
than
a
heineken
but
not
a
good
beer
imo
smooth
crisp
beer
to
enjoy
on
a
warm
day
ive
tasted
better
thats
for
sure
but
totally
worth
trying
smooth
classic
beer
cant
get
enough
stella

crisp
and
clean
when
enjoyed
in
the
correct
chalice
overall
too
delicate
missing
some
freshness
and
lots
of
flavors
i
find
this
beer
a
little
off
in
comparison
the
heineken
is
better
in
my
opinion
not
bad
smooth
with
just
a
light
kick
needs
salt
feel
very
smooth
and
refreshing
lightbodied
great
for
a
meal
or
following
a
porterstout
love
it
best
green
label
ever
not
too
much
going
on
this
beer
simply
has
nothing
to
offer
except
i
suppose
a
means
of
consuming
alcohol
the
lack
of
aroma
followed
by
the
absence
of
flavor
makes
this
the
beer
equivalent
of
eating
cardboard
i
give
it
a
2
overall
because
it
isnt
bad
per
se
it
just
isnt
good
one
could
drink
this
without
any
real
complaint
but
i
dont
know
why
when
there
are
so
many
other
better
options
one
of
my
favs
nice
light
taste
easy
drinking
tastes
like
an
american
lager
but
there
seems
to
be
more
body
to
it
as
long
as
the
price
stays
low
i
will
continue
to
buy
this
nice
beer
one
of
my
favorites
and
very
different
depending
on
whether
youre
drinking
the
bottled
version
or
the
canned
the
canned
seems
creamier
blander
why
the
11oz
bottle
and
not
the
12oz
its
almost
as
if
im
getting
robbed
out
of
a
beer
when
i
get
the
12
pack
dont
get
it
tastes
like
re
bottled
mgd
no
flavor
and
watery
if
i
had
to
blind
taste
it
id
be
sure
i
was
drinking
a
mainstream
american
lager
a
classic
whenever
i
am
looking
to
switch
it
up
i
reach
for
a
stella
ive
never
been
a
huge
fan
of
this
stuff
its
a
little
insipid
if
this
wasnt
part
of
a
variety
pack
i
would
have
never
bought
it
best
beer
in
the
game
mediocre
at
best
this
was
a
light
beer
with
no
real
body
leaving
nothing
to
be
remembered
well
this
was
ok
reminds
me
of
a
skunked
beer
but
with
some
for
flavor
of
hops
that
not
common
so
honestly
its
get
what
you
pay
for
and
i
respect
that
just
try
it
and
judge
it
yourself
i
dont
get
the
attraction
pours
a
strawyellow
in
color
with
about
a
good
1finger
foamy
white
head
that
settles
down
to
around
2mm
after
a
while
with
some
sticky
lacing
seen
after
each
sip
lots
of
tiny
streaming
bubbles
rising
the
whole
time
until
the
end
the
aroma
has
that
typical
skunk
aroma
that
is
so
common
in
green
bottles
for
some
reason
and
also
just
grains
the
taste
is
pretty
much
just
of
grains
and
sweet
grass
with
a
hint
of
corn
slight
dry
finish
but
it
is
drinkable
lighter
to
mediumbodied
with
lots
of
carbonation
nothing
really
special
and
is
just
ok
i
love
this
beer
its
been
my
favorite
since
i
started
drinking
and
just
feels
better
than
anything
else
do
belgians
really
drink
this
stuff
v
not
good
let
the
champagne
style
wrapping
on
the
bottle
be
a
sign
this
is
considered
one
of
the
classiest
beers
of
the
domestics
it
isnt
cheap
and
until
youre
actually
craving
one
its
seldom
worth
the
price
interesting
change
of
pace
from
an
american
lager
but
id
rather
have
a
heineken
great
taste
body
excellente
beer
with
great
favor
perfect
after
taste
its
not
as
good
as
stella
ortiz
seems
almost
like
a
nonalcoholic
beer
like
water
was
run
over
an
open
beer
can
and
captured
in
a
bottle
after
i
quit
smoking
i
lost
my
taste
for
corona
my
old
safety
beer
this
is
my
new
choice
which
most
would
agree
its
better
than
the
old
solid
session
lager

made
a

better
by
the

bodied
with
high
carbonation
and
a

fairly
standard
for

this

delicious
and
i
recommend
it
to
others
all
the
time
because
of
the
fact
that
it
is
a
good
tasting
beer
and
the
cidre
from
stella
artois
is
just
as
good
i
got
a
4
pack
of
stella
artois
cidre
for
my
birthday
and
i
really
enjoyed
drinking
them
and
sharing
one
with
my
fiancee
she
is
not
a
real
big
fan
of
beer
but
she
enjoys
stella
artois
just
as
much
as
i
do

25dont
plan
on
trying
again
the
store
i
buy
from
is
very
good
so
i
dont
think
this
was
a
bad
bottle
it
reminds
me
of
the
average
large
scale
generic
euro
or
us
beers
i
dont
understand
why
any
beer
is
in
clear
or
green
bottles
are
those
bottles
cheaper
to
make
considering
the
price
one
could
do
worse
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
the
aroma
2013

is

so
when
you
buy
a
case
you
spend
more
for
the
import
and
are
already
two
beers
light
that
rant
out
of
the
way
2013
32
6kp29mar
31
ive
had
this
on
tap
pub
pint
glasses
and
bottled
spiegelau
lager
and
pilsner
glasses
its
fine
either
way
this
is
often
the
best
lager
available
on
tap
for
me
locally
not
the
best
beer
but
the
best
lager
my
oa
rating
is
based
on
that
how
good
the
beer
is
within
its
style
or
niche
overall
all
in
all
its
a
decent
beer
better
then
bud
and
miller
i
will
stick
with
olde
english
for
price
point
but
this
not
bad
beer
overall
a
very
light
clean
drinkable
lager
nothing
exceptional
but
not
a
terrible
choice
if
options
are
limited
hey
this
was
pretty
good
beer
im
drinking
this
real
cold
and
am
enjoying
it
tastes
a
little
like
heineken
and
while
its
not
going
to
win
any
contests
it
is
still
a
beer
and
as
ben
franklin
said
its
proof
that
god
loves
us
and
wants
us
to
be
happy
ill
drink
it
again
and
again
the
marketing
this
beers
employs
shows
it
as
a
classy
flavorful
beverage
for
fancy
people
once
you
actually
taste
it
you
realize
its
a
shit
beer
that
people
use
to
show
theyre
more
important
than
they
actually
are
reviewed
at
the
flagship
brubakers
in
lovely
downtown
akron
oh
o
not
horrible
lol
pretty
safe
reminds
me
of
what
beer
would
taste
like
if
bud
hooked
up
with
amstel
light
for
a
one
night
stand
and
bud
slipped
one
past
the
goalie
overall
although
it
certainly
wont
be
my
first
choice
of
a
beer
to
drink
i
can
honestly
say
i
dont
think
that
it
will
be
the
last
time
i
try
this
beer
ill
take
it
over
most
other
products
budweiser
has
its
name
stamped
on
any
day
oh
well
i
guess
im
just
spoiled
most
everything
sold
at
711
is
just
not
up
my
alley
not
without
a
whiskey
chaser
at
least
oi
decided
to
try
this
as
a
complement
to
buffalo
wild
wings
hot
wings
and
it
did
not
pair
that
well
i
am
not
familiar
with
the
style
so
my
points
are
geared
more
towards
traditional
lagers
better
than
average
flavor
but
not
nearly
as
good
as
many
crafts
out
there
o
first
time
ive
ever
had
this
beer
and
as
far
as
pale
lagers
go
this
one
was
good
if
the
selection
at
a
restaurant
is
lacking
then
ill
go
to
this
one
from
now
on
overall
this
beer
is
my
choice
in
sessioning
beer
even
if
i
rarely
do
anymore
its
very
over
hyped
and
really
doesnt
deserve
that
pouring
ritual
they
have
for
it
not
worth
the
money
for
most
people
but
my
store
sells
it
at
the
same
price
as
bud
or
coors
which
is
strange
my
fridge
is
usually
always
stocked
with
it
it
does
get
skunky
maybe
like
23
per
24
but
nothing
like
a
heineken
or
a
corona
above
average
but
not
stellar
i
find
it
very
nice
and
very
drinkable
a
tasty
sessionable
brew
that
may
not
be
on
bas
top
100
but
ill
sit
and
and
drink
a
few
regardless
oan
embarrassment
to
belgium
taste
nothing
like
any
other
belgian
out
there
tastes
much
more
macro
average
euro
lager
the
taste
is
a
bit
better
with
bready
pale
malts
and
an
almost
tart
but
also
dry
hopped
finale
and
lingering
bitterness
this
is
not
one
that
i
have
frequently
but
drinking
it
in
a
can
or
on
tap
would
be
recommended
i
had
it
ice
cold
from
the
bottle
into
a
pilsner
glass
i
can
smell
hops
some
malted
barley
but
not
that
much
but
its
basically
a
similar
smell
to
heineken
you
just
get
that
european
hoppy
skunky
smell
but
nothing
off
puting
the
beer
has
about
2
inches
of
foam
white
head
to
it
very
appealing
golden
straw
colour
to
the
beer
with
lots
of
carbonation
the
taste
is
very
smooth
it
also
reminds
me
of
a
nice
cold
heinken
but
less
skunky
the
taste
is
very
nice
and
soft
you
can
feel
the
carbonation
the
whole
way
through
from
your
tounge
to
your
throat
its
basically
a
heineken
but
with
a
weaker
bitter
aftertast
compared
to
the
heineken
but
overall
its
a
very
nice
beer
nothing
off
putting
about
the
taste
is
brilliant
very
drinkable
this
is
a
perfect
example
of
you
get
what
you
pay
for
in
canada
its
around
25
a
12
of
bottles
and
compare
it
to
budweiser
which
is
around
20
a
12
but
yeah
great
beer
i
would
reccomend
to
anyone
that
likes
heineken
and
also
great
for
christmas
to
cheers
merry
christmas
from
drunky
the
clown
would
i
buy
it
again
yes
from
the
tap
it
poured
an
eyeappealing
golden
color
crisp
and
clear
the
head
was
white
but
small
and
it
had
staying
power
the
lacing
was
good
too
sticking
to
the
glass
all
the
way
down
i
couldnt
really
smell
anything
but
the
hops
i
was
hoping
for
more
but
nope
nothing
mouthfeel
was
impressive
it
wet
my
tongue
without
an
overly
obnoxious
carbonation
that
much
i
liked
its
taste
wasnt
anything
better
or
worse
from
some
other
lagers
ive
had
in
fact
i
had
to
convince
myself
it
didnt
taste
watery
to
me
but
just
to
hedge
my
bets
i
kept
its
overall
rating
at
an
average
lager
overall
average
pale
lager
nothing
special
a
rather
bland
euro
pale
lager
o
like
your
typical
greenbottled
beer
its
all
about
the
skunkiness
maybe
it
would
be
better
on
tap
but
from
the
bottle
all
i
really
get
is
that
skunk
o
all
in
all
its
just
an
average
beer
maybe
a
little
above
average
but
by
a
hair
at
most
i
would
say
its
worth
a
try
but
everyones
probably
had
this
before
so
no
need
to
much
better
options
out
there
for
euro
lagers
one
of
my
least
favorite
beers
ever
huge
difference
between
ontap
and
out
of
the
bottle
one
of
the
most
drinkable
beers
ever
made
clear
golden
and
very
little
head
smooth
and
crisp
taste
with
a
very
pleasant
after
taste
perfect
beer
to
drink
to
quench
your
thirst
on
a
hot
day
also
pairs
well
with
food
like
poultry
and
fish
enjoy
lightly
sweet
grain
slight
grassy
very
mild
hop
bitterness
towards
the
finish
body
is
light
dry
aftertaste
crisp
well
carbonated
o
its
hard
to
say
anything
bad
about
stella
artois
however
i
dont
have
anything
really
great
to
say
about
it
either
to
me
stella
is
a
solid
choice
for
a
euro
lager
there
are
better
out
there
but
there
are
also
way
way
way
worse
lagers
this
blows
american
macros
out
of
the
water
what
this
beer
lacks
in
character
it
makes
up
for
by
being
easy
to
drink
and
having
a
pleasant
flavor
that
could
be
enjoyed
and
even
appreciated
by
most
this
is
a
beer
i
wont
buy
very
often
but
if
it
was
offered
to
me
at
a
gathering
id
be
very
pleased
infact
id
probably
every
compliment
the
host
on
their
excellent
choice
of
beer
overall
a
decent
euro
lager
but
its
not
worth
a
premium
price
interestingly
that
the
first
ones
that
arrived
to
brazil
tasted
better
and
then
went
to
the
common
ground
i
though
that
would
follow
an
international
standard
i
guess
inbev
cares
mostly
on
the
short
term
life
span
of
its
brands
hope
they
keep
laffe
with
a
good
taste
for
what
your
buck
is
worth
it
pours
a
medium
golden
straw
with
a
decent
bubbly
white
head
that
slowly
dissipates
smells
of
pilsner
malt
a
hint
of
spicy
hops
and
a
touch
of
skunk
the
flavor
is
crisp
and
clean
bready
sweet
pilsner
with
just
enough
spicy
hop
to
try
to
provide
some
balance
medium
to
light
body
with
a
spirited
level
of
carbonation
and
a
spicy
bubbly
mouthfeel
meh
serviceable
pale
lager
that
was
my
best
choice
at
dinner
but
really
nothing
special
drunk
it
mostly
as
a
cheep
beer
which
you
can
have
in
big
amounts
with
friends
its
quite
flat
but
it
quenches
the
thirst
very
good
o
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
lager
although
it
is
not
worth
the
price
you
pay
for
it
meh
another
runofthemill
macro
lager
bland
watery
and
uninteresting
i
guess
it
would
quench
your
thirst
on
a
hot
day
but
it
serves
little
other
purpose
give
it
a
miss
o
not
really
a
good
beer
but
if
youre
looking
for
a
euro
pale
lager
im
not
sure
that
i
could
point
you
in
a
better
direction
this
beer
is
definitely
best
as
an
accent
of
a
good
night
not
centered
around
beer
stella
take
a
bud
crank
up
the
malt
flavor
a
bit
and
there
you
have
a
stella
stella
is
a
good
option
if
you
want
a
basic
no
frills
beer
recommended
good
news
is
that
you
can
find
this
beer
served
in
many
bars
and
restaurants
these
days
not
always
a
guarantee
that
you
will
get
the
proper
glass
as
you
would
in
belguim
but
i
have
seen
a
sparlking
stella
in
the
proper
chalice
in
pretty
remote
digs
if
youre
of
the
mbc
crowd
i
can
see
why
this
represents
the
epitome
of
belgian
brewing
sophistication
otherwise
its
a
better
than
average
beer
from
a
worse
than
average
style
final
thoughts
even
though
this
is
a
macrolager
it
has
a
definite
edge
on
its
american
counterpart
there
is
no
adjunct
taste
in
this
beer
if
youre
a
macrolager
drinker
then
take
that
first
step
and
order
a
stella
artois
from
there
who
knows
maybe
youll
conquer
your
fears
by
ordering
some
beers
with
real
character
all
in
all
i
wouldnt
seek
this
beer
out
again
but
i
can
appreciate
some
of
the
craftsmanship
that
goes
into
it
im
not
so
sure
this
beer
is
better
than
average
but
its
different
enough
to
make
it
interesting
i
would
never
buy
it
but
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
o
there
isnt
a
lot
going
on
in
this
beer
but
there
isnt
supposed
to
be
much
with
this
style
its
a
decent
example
and
a
good
thirst
quenching
beer
but
its
kind
of
flat
and
lifeless
the
nose
is
clean
with
out
any
defects
but
it
is
so
faint
while
there
is
a
bit
more
substance
to
the
flavor
its
not
by
much
generic
euro
lager
best
ontap
or
in
the
can
3
0
i
have
friends
who
think
that
this
is
the
greatest
but
i
just
dont
see
it
o
not
bad
i
know
ive
had
far
worse
pale
lagers
if
your
doing
some
yard
work
in
the
heat
its
not
the
worst
case
scenario
overall
this
is
just
slightly
above
average
pretty
average
but
not
bad
o
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
one
smooth
fluid
very
sessionable
odthere
are
worse
things
than
stella
artois
one
of
those
worst
case
scenario
beers
i
will
find
at
a
barbecue
still
it
has
the
potential
to
hit
the
spot
on
some
very
rare
occasions
whatever
you
thing
most
lagers
look
taste
feel
smell
and
seem
like
is
what
this
is
reminded
me
of
coors
light
nothing
but
just
another
lager
to
me
no
flavor
no
lingering
taste
of
anything
very
boring
boring
boring
could
have
done
with
out
this
one
will
do
with
out
this
one
overall
a
very
nice
beer
and
one
that
i
was
looking
down
to
it
untill
recently
due
to
all
the
hype
330ml
bottle
lager
glass
pale
yellow

yeasty
floral

citric

with

smooth

aftertaste
o
overall
not
a
very
good
beer
not
a
ton
going
on
a
bit
overcarbonated
and
a
tiny
bit
skunky
in
the
taste
would
not
want
to
have
it
again
draft
pint
at
a
ball
game
clear
golden
yellow
with
a
thin
white
head
with
surprisingly
decent
lacing
aroma
is
bread
yeast
biscuit
lemongrass
and
some
spice
probably
coriander
taste
is
bready
malty
and
belgian
yeast
with
a
spicy
lemon
twist
kinda
adjunct
lagerish
but
ok
o
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
but
has
more
of
the
feeling
of
bmc
than
craft
beer
very
sessionable
as
the
flavorsaromas
are
not
too
intense
and
the
abv
is
moderate
overall
certainly
a
drinkable
lager
would
rather
drink
this
over
the
macro
lagers
of
america
for
a
euro
pale
lager
it
accomplishes
what
it
needs
to
o
only
worth
buying
over
macro
american
lagers
seems
to
have
a
lot
of
presentation
its
basically
corn
flavored
water
nice
eurotrash
lager
i
would
recommend
this
over
nearly
any
american
lager
and
most
european
pilsners
but
if
you
are
looking
for
more
flavor
you
need
look
elsewhere
so
i
popped
my
first
bottle
and
poured
it
into
a
pint
glass
the
first
thing
i
noticed
was
man
this
smells
like
a
brewery
it
brought
me
back
to
a
saturday
job
i
had
in
the
old
seattle
malt
and
brewing
basement
any
beer
that
smells
like
a
brewery
and
not
a
model
airplane
glue
factory
or
the
compost
bucket
cant
be
all
bad
so
on
to
the
taste
its
got
a
preponderance
of
bitter
malt
but
not
strong
hop
flavor
i
feared
i
would
be
up
against
another
harsh
belgian
farmhouse
ale
type
but
this
was
rather
more
like
putting
a
suit
on
the
farmhouse
ale
and
bringing
it
to
the
big
city
unlike
the
normal
american
standard
lagers
the
taste
does
not
stick
around
making
you
wish
you
had
an
altoid
but
leaves
you
with
a
pleasant
gustatory
memory
this
drinks
real
nice
and
makes
you
want
to
knock
back
another
one
it
takes
lager
beer
from
a
duty
to
a
pleasure
o
im
not
a
fan
of
euro
lagers
but
for
the
style
stella
artois
is
decent
it
is
what
it
is
overall
easy
beer
to
drink
and
like
you
can
give
this
o
almost
anyone
and
they
shouldnt
complain
salud
overall
true
to
the
style
which
usually
isnt
very
good
still
drinkable
and
somewhat
refreshing
one
of
the
better
members
of
the
genre
pours
a
crystal
clear
yellowgold
with
a
1
inch
foamy
white
head
that
settles
to
a
thin
cap
on
top
of
the
beer
foamy
rings
of
lace
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
light
grain
aromas
and
some
pretty
serious
skunking
up
front
that
dissipates
with
time
taste
is
of
grains
and
some
herbal
and
grassy
flavors
there
is
a
mild
bitterness
with
each
sip
that
quickly
fades
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
average
lager
all
around
thats
not
all
that
bad
once
the
skunk
disappears
overall
just
so
just
bad
overall
for
the
fancy
foreign
name
and
the
pretentiousness
surrounding
this
brand
sometimes
it
tastes
like
any
of
the
pale
or
adjunct
lagers
just
a
bit
better
at
least
they
give
out
cool
glasses
i
would
actually
drink
this
again
stella
has
broken
the
curse
of
the
green
bottle
so
for
that
i
give
props
overall
pretty
one
dimensional
but
very
easy
to
drink
m
the
sensation
is
pleasant
very
balanced
with
a
center
bittersweet
starting
and
a
little
more
bitter
ending
of
all
the
yucky
euro
stuff
out
there
i
really
think
this
might
be
the
head
of
the
class
green
bottles
usually
turn
me
off
especially
on
imports
but
when
its
fresh
and
freezing
cold
stella
isnt
bad
pours
a
thin
yellow
color
with
pretty
good
carbonation
before
the
head
fades
to
nothing
smells
like
a
pale
lager
balanced
but
boring
flavor
is
the
same
tolerable
but
unexiting
the
thing
that
i
think
makes
this
one
is
the
feel
its
light
without
being
water
and
its
bubbly
without
being
soda
two
things
many
of
the
american
versions
fail
to
accomplish
its
infinitely
drinkable
for
that
reason
and
not
a
bad
brew
on
a
hot
day
overall
i
will
never
buy
this
but
i
will
always
always
chose
it
over
the
bud
lights
of
the
world
overall
not
a
great
beer
good
thing
to
drink
when
you
dont
want
to
know
what
youre
drinking
overall
not
terribly
impressive
but
better
than
your
usual
macros
not
quite
a
yuengling
at
least
they
have
some
flavor
profile
stella
is
just
a
smoother
aal
that
has
slightly
more
body
o
a
decent
lager
but
the
appearance
the
introduction
is
the
best
part
o
not
bad
but
it
really
cant
compare
to
some
of
the
other
beer
that
come
out
of
belgium
o
a
solid
beer
for
what
it
is
the
appearance
is
a
bit
of
off
yellow
with
a
strange
off
hue
to
it
did
not
pour
for
a
look
at
the
head
but
would
imagine
it
would
be
a
thick
or
lumpy
head
based
on
the
feel
on
the
beer
the
smell
is
very
different
grassy
hops
and
maybe
a
bit
of
corn
the
taste
is
different
definitely
not
my
favorite
type
of
beer
but
not
at
all
my
least
favorite
the
mouthfeel
is
like
beer
mixed
with
pop
rocks
it
is
difficult
to
explain
but
something
that
has
to
be
tried
to
experience
and
understand
i
think
the
beer
is
carbonated
but
surprisingly
smooth
and
would
be
a
recommended
beer
to
anyone
who
hasnt
tried
it
o
its
not
a
bad
beer
as
some
make
it
out
to
be
but
its
not
the
best
beer
on
the
market
either
drinkability
its
a
very
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
with
bland
flavors
and
aromas
taste
is
sweet
and
malty
but
not
bad
thinbodied
but
smoothdrinking
like
a
fresher
heineken
almost
but
better
than
that
may
imply
theres
nothing
complex
going
on
here
but
not
bad
for
what
it
is
i
poured
this
beer
into
a
pint
glass
it
has
a
golden
color
body
with
a
light
fizzy
head
the
smell
is
of
corn
and
grain
the
taste
is
light
ans
same
as
the
smell
the
mouth
feel
is
average
overall
a
good
session
beer
i
would
rather
drink
this
than
any
bmc
m
spritzy
thin
and
light
as
it
should
be
overall
not
a
bad
beer
sweet
and
refreshing
with
a
slight
bitterness
at
the
end
golden
color
with
a
snow
white
head
decent
lacing
and
a
pleasant
aroma
you
will
here
much
talk
about
how
its
a
skunky
beer
but
id
much
rather
drink
this
than
a
budcoors
or
a
miller
do
yourself
a
favor
and
give
it
a
fair
try
and
i
think
youll
find
what
i
did
a
hidden
little
gem
obefore
i
got
into
craft
this
would
have
been
awesome
now
its
slighly
above
average
this
is
a
great
import
to
have
for
image
conscious
consumers
that
dont
want
to
be
burdened
by
taste
mouthfeel
or
finish
while
they
look
somewhat
glamorous
holding
the
bottle
in
public
or
private
gatherings
of
distinguished
philistines
o
something
i
would
never
want
to
pick
again
if
theres
a
selection
but
a
change
of
pace
is
always
a
good
thing
overall
having
never
tasted
this
beer
before
im
a
bit
disappointed
even
by
euro
lager
standards
price
point
is
especially
bad
there
are
many
others
within
this
style
i
would
rather
drink
before
stella
i
cant
ever
see
myself
revisiting
this
again
after
i
polish
off
this
12
pack
pours
a
light
golden
ale
with
a
finger
of
fleeting
loose
white
foam
and
brilliant
clarity
spotty
lace
smells
of
some
skunk
white
grapes
grain
and
a
hint
of
hay
taste
is
smooth
with
sweet
grains
and
little
else
really
quite
drinkable
particularly
from
a
green
bottle
light
body
with
moderately
hi
carb
not
a
bad
beer
for
green
bottle
and
potentially
long
light
exposure
the
moderate
skunk
sucks
but
overall
this
beer
isnt
too
shabby
and
i
particularly
like
it
on
tap
during
warmer
months
overall
an
easy
drinking
lager
but
not
very
impressive
o
given
the
category
this
honestly
isnt
bad
granted
the
chances
of
getting
a
nonskunked
pour
due
to
the
insane
green
bottles
is
very
slim
but
when
it
isnt
skunked
its
a
pretty
inoffensive
and
subtle
beer
thats
putting
it
really
nicely
overall
not
bad
an
easy
drinking
more
flavorful
alternative
to
aals
but
similar
enough
to
please
aal
drinkers
its
high
price
is
a
big
turn
off
however
overall
i
drank
stella
a
lot
when
i
was
learning
that
there
were
other
beers
out
there
besides
miller
lite
i
enjoyed
it
then
but
today
its
just
an
easy
drinking
chuggable
lager
nothing
special
nothing
desirable
cheers
lampertland
overall
pretty
runofthemill
not
bad
but
definitely
not
memorable
either
over
all
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
but
it
is
not
great
it
has
more
flavor
and
pop
than
most
of
the
american
macros
that
is
a
personal
taste
when
i
have
a
beer
i
like
it
to
have
something
going
on
and
this
beer
has
a
little
to
offer
that
way
given
a
choice
between
this
and
a
budweiser
i
would
choose
this
eric
overall
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
but
i
do
not
see
myself
buying
it
again
looks
like
busch
light
when
poured
from
the
bottle
tastes
like
sierra
mist
its
kinda
clean
i
was
expecting
more
copper
taste
like
heineken
but
this
one
is
cleaner
its
fizzy
like
champagne
this
would
be
a
great
beer
to
have
while
golfing
or
eating
an
almond
raspberry
salad
on
the
back
porch
on
a
hot
summer
afternoon
o
i
would
recommend
this
beer
if
you
want
a
good
tasting
easily
accessible
drinkable
brew
otastes
like
a
skunked
macro
lager
not
a
fan
i
will
pass
on
this
from
now
on
overall
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
the
flavor
kinda
reminds
me
of
a
blegianstyle
ale
i
really
like
this
o
this
is
probably
pretty
average
for
a
european
pale
lager
i
find
it
similar
to
many
beers
of
this
type
that
are
brewed
throughout
europe
there
are
worse
out
there
but
stella
is
certainly
nothing
special
in
this
day
and
age
a
basic
simple
drinkable
pale
lager
but
not
a
beer
id
ever
seek
out
an
average
example
of
a
lame
style
overall
extremely
boring
yet
drinkable
so
i
guess
that
counts
for
something
its
funny
that
people
think
that
imported
macros
stella
becks
molson
are
worth
the
extra
money
compared
to
their
u
s
counterparts
not
much
of
a
difference
in
quality
or
taste
really
lean
on
flavour
but
at
least
its
clean
flavour
not
exactly
my
goto
beer
but
i
wont
say
i
disliked
it
either
at
least
the
gift
set
it
came
in
contained
a
glass
merry
christmas
better
than
i
expected
boring
but
easydrinking
and
cleaner
than
a
lot
of
the
eurolagers
o
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
and
tastes
ok
thats
about
it
drinkability
this
beer
was
crisp
and
refreshing
in
the
sense
of
thirstquenching
not
flavor
this
is
industrial
beer
flavored
water
a
european
version
of
bud
or
coors
or
miller
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
particularly
after
working
outside
during
the
summer
i
suppose
but
there
are
so
many
other
beers
out
there
that
are
better
than
this
overall
its
not
what
i
like
but
for
those
who
like
this
kind
of
beer
its
for
you
for
me
though
it
wasnt
all
that
great
or
enjoyable
i
would
rather
have
me
a
nice
stout
or
ipa
something
exciting
to
taste
pours
a
light
gold
with
a
frothy
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
carbonation
bubbles
seen
rising
to
top
when
held
to
light
taste
is
good
very
crisp
with
a
mix
of
citrus
and
some
fruity
sweetness
again
it
is
a
smooth
and
very
drinkable
beer
and
does
not
have
some
of
those
skunky
overtones
seen
in
other
euro
lagers
i
think
ill
have
this
again
while
this
has
more
flavor
than
a
bud
or
bud
light
the
flavor
here
is
just
terrible
this
is
not
as
bad
as
a
miller
chill
but
damn
it
is
bad
overall
this
was
nothing
spectacular
it
hits
the
style
on
the
nose
but
reminds
me
too
much
of
the
big
name
lagers
best
before

o
this
really
may
be
the
most
average
beer
on
the
planet
straight
meh
all
the
way
through
nothing
offensive
but
nothing
at
all
redeeming
either
oh
i
guess
it
goes
down
easily
enough
overall
excellent
for
drinking
indoors
or
outdoors
in
little
or
large
quantities
heavily
marketed
with
bern
stern
photos
obviously
trying
and
likely
succeeding
at
making
this
an
upscale
choice
for
those
who
dont
know
any
better
skip
it
poured
this
european
lager
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
this
lager
poured
a
slightly
hazy
pale
color
produced
a
nice
white
frothy
head
decent
retention
and
decent
amount
of
lacing
left
behind
the
aroma
of
this
lager
consisted
of
sweet
malted
grain
and
a
afterthought
of
hops
light
in
body
this
brew
is
sweet
dry
graininess
and
finishes
with
a
bitter
broccoli
like
finish
that
most
european
lagers
are
known
for
decent
for
a
european
lager
i
have
had
worse
but
not
something
i
would
ever
pay
for
again
overall
it
is
an
ok
beer
but
there
are
much
better
euro
pale
lagers
out
there
a
nice
alternative
to
bmc
though
o
decent
but
not
something
i
would
reach
for
normally
the
green
bottle
doesnt
help
but
i
would
give
it
a
shot
from
the
new
can
t
its
better
than
a
lot
of
the
lagers
out
there
but
its
still
just
not
that
good
faint
hops
and
slightly
bready
malts
along
with
a
faint
hint
of
golden
apples
this
strikes
me
as
only
one
step
above
being
accurately
labelled
as
a
belgian
budweiser
would
i
go
out
of
my
way
for
one
not
at
all
would
i
take
it
over
american
adjunct
lagers
for
sure
not
bad
for
what
it
is
overall
pretty
easy
drinking
kind
of
ordinary
but
about
as
basic
as
a
simple
lager
gets
i
would
say
ive
had
lots
of
this
in
my
life
on
occasion
and
out
of
the
can
it
works
out
fine
stay
away
from
the
bottles
though
they
are
more
than
likely
going
to
be
skunked
o
i
couldnt
really
find
much
of
anything
wrong
with
this
beer
with
all
the
not
so
great
publicity
this
gets
around
these
parts
its
not
all
that
bad
especially
considering
the
style
im
not
sure
what
i
expected
here
but
overall
im
not
impressed
its
a
step
above
the
typical
big
three
i
compare
this
to
heineken
because
its
almost
exactly
the
same
as
far
as
aroma
and
taste
profiles
go
this
is
the
best
of
the
economical
beers
i
have
tasted
some
people
say
the
bud
light
of
belgium
but
belgium
has
some
of
the
best
beer
in
the
world
so
i
am
fine
drinking
quite
possibly
one
of
the
best
value
beers
out
there
i
do
recommend
this
beer
if
u
dont
want
to
spend
more
on
high
class
stuff
oaverage
lager
nothing
special
may
be
ok
with
pub
food
o
better
on
a
hot
summer
day
or
with
different
food
i
suppose
o
its
ok
but
for
all
its
name
value
its
not
that
much
better
of
a
pale
lager
overall
good
drinking
for
style
serve
cold
o
this
is
one
of
my
very
favorite
macros
and
will
take
it
any
day
over
its
euro
lager
kin
yummy
o
average
beer
but
still
worthy
of
semicraft
status
good
mellow
flavor
and
very
refreshing
to
drink
alright
lets
be
honest
here
this
beer
is
not
getting
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
or
a
chalice
it
is
a
classic
lager
and
it
is
easy
to
drink
alot
of
these
bad
boys
i
picked
up
a
15
pack
of
330ml
bottles
for
my
adventures
at
school
in
london
this
beer
is
simple
crisp
and
smooth
a
great
alternitive
to
the
big
three
at
home
its
always
hard
to
turn
down
a
cold
stella
so
all
in
all
this
is
just
a
slightly
better
than
average
beer
but
it
is
definitely
a
good
choice
for
easy
drinking
light
grain
a
shit
ton
of
belgian
slightly
funk
yeast
and
mild
hops
for
the
most
part
its
just
the
yeast
that
stands
out
tongue
follows
pretty
balanced
light
brew
here
not
robust
and
rich
as
found
in
ales
but
highly
drinkable
and
crisp
like
a
lager
should
be
in
my
opinion
o
not
too
bad
although
i
think
i
prefer
other
lagers
over
this
one
i
also
have
had
this
with
pizza
before
and
it
went
well
together
o
definitely
would
have
over
and
over
have
had
this
many
times
and
realized
have
never
rated
it
overhyped
and
near
ubiquitous
for
some
reason
its
become
a
marker
of
a
classy
joint
although
theres
any
number
of
better
brews
just
as
or
should
be
widely
available
and
around
the
same
price
point
anyways
marketing
aside
this
has
that
distinctive
stella
flavor
profile
consistent
in
the
way
that
i
would
expect
it
to
be
again
with
the
snark
it
was
not
unpleasant
which
is
about
as
generous
as
ill
get
with
this
beer
drank
it
with
pizza
they
played
well
together
oepls
are
usually
bad
beersbut
this
one
is
more
then
thatit
is
good
o
nothing
too
special
only
reason
i
still
pick
it
up
is
due
to
nostalgia
as
it
used
to
be
a
favorite
o
not
really
into
the
style
but
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
better
mass
produced
euro
pale
lagers
i
probably
wouldnt
buy
it
but
if
given
to
me
i
would
drink
it
with
no
problems
overall
drinkability
plus
for
nice
appearance
but
with
the
ingredients
of
malted
barley
water
maize
yeast
and
hops
this
is
really
an
adjunct
lager
its
odd
but
i
think
the
slightly
skunked
flavor
adds
some
character
to
the
beer
when
its
in
a
bottle
otherwise
this
beer
is
nothing
special
definitely
drinkable
but
a
bit
boring
not
bad
for
what
it
is
the
bud
of
belgium
but
this
is
only
barely
a
step
above
standard
american
adjunct
lagers
considering
this
was
one
of
those
strange
beers
i
started
put
on
back
about
10
years
ago
im
surprised
how
much
i
find
it
lackluster
now
and
even
more
surprised
to
see
i
hadnt
reviewed
it
not
recommended
for
purchase
though
grins
overall
impression
im
very
glad
i
went
out
of
my
way
to
enjoy
this
brew
again
havent
had
in
almost
a
year
these
brews
arent
very
poundable
as
they
have
quite
a
bit
of
flavor
and
hop
presence
will
not
be
getting
this
often
in
the
future
but
will
say
go
and
get
yourself
some
of
the
new
stella
cans
very
nice
too
bad
i
dont
have
the
glassware
that
goes
with
it
i
will
not
try
this
again
unless
it
is
the
only
beer
option
od
not
tasty
at
all
i
would
never
buy
this
and
im
glad
it
was
free
typical
of
the
style
i
guess
clear
golden
color
with
a
frothy
white
head
aromas
are
typical
grain
with
a
hint
of
spice
and
the
faint
skunky
smell
that
is
common
in
a
lot
of
european
lagers
that
are
imported
to
the
us
flavors
of
grain
slightly
spicy
hops
and
a
faint
yeastiness
that
distinguishes
this
beer
in
my
view
from
other
largeproduction
european
lagers
that
it
otherwise
tastes
like
an
easy
drinking
style
that
works
fine
for
washing
down
lunch
or
taking
a
break
on
a
warm
afternoon
o
i
have
heard
good
things
about
this
beer
most
of
my
life
and
actually
never
had
one
until
now
i
probably
wont
ever
have
one
again
either
unless
its
free
this
one
was
it
is
just
boring
and
overrated
popular
only
because
others
say
so
and
comes
along
with
a
strong
marketing
campaign
the
worst
belgian
beer
i
have
ever
had
it
is
very
lightly
carbonated
on
the
verge
of
being
flat
it
is
fairly
light
in
body
making
it
easy
to
drink
overall
it
is
not
terrible
and
is
certainly
better
than
the
standard
bmc
fare
however
for
the
price
there
are
much
better
options
out
there
cheers
overall
more
fuller
bodied
and
flavorful
than
american
predecessors
i
can
see
why
it
gets
slightly
higher
ratings
but
then
again
thats
why
they
are
under
different
guidelines
this
is
definitely
a
beer
that
i
would
like
to
have
on
hand
for
a
rainy
day
go
to
beer
especially
in
the
can
because
i
just
dont
trust
green
bottles
anymore
note
about
nomenclature
you
have
to
refer
to
it
as
stella
or
you
get
a
blank
look
from
the
server
angloamerican
and
spanishspeaking
waitpersons
cant
and
wont
say
artois
if
you
explain
that

this
is
a
very
good
example
of
a
pale
lager
and
is
much
better
that
its
american
counterparts
this
beer
is
perfect
for
someone
wanting
to
enjoy
a
few
drinks
without
getting
something
very
hardy

and
unfortunately
i
cant
argue
with
that
it
has
substance
if
just
a
little
bit
and
maybe
as
such
makes
the
natty
statement
unfair
im
just
not
terribly
impressed
with
it
as
a
belgian
it
betrays
itself
its
trying
to
sell
itself
before
its
trying
to
contribute
to
a
larger
body
of
taste
that
its
country
is
capable
of
and
this
is
saddening
i
wouldnt
pay
any
more
than
60usd
for
12floz
i
believe
that
it
could
be
a
lot
more
than
it
is
right
now
especially
if
they
claim
a
heritage
that
hearkens
back
to
1366
lets
see
it
pours
a
darker
gold
color
not
really
yellow
but
not
quite
amber
either
a
limited
head
with
limited
retention
the
nose
was
limited
overall
but
some
grainy
notes
as
well
as
some
lager
yeast
characteristics
very
clean
overall
but
if
you
really
start
looking
you
can
pick
out
some
lighter
hop
notes
the
taste
has
more
of
a
malty
presence
than
what
the
nose
indicated
some
grainy
tastes
that
blend
well
with
a
very
light
caramel
flavor
the
hops
are
basically
nonexistent
leaving
a
sweet
finish
the
beer
itself
is
rather
wispy
and
tones
down
the
sweeter
flavors
some
lighter
yeast
finish
but
nothing
too
bad
the
body
is
light
but
understandable
for
style
a
clean
taste
but
not
as
crisp
for
style
either
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
to
say
in
the
least
d
stella
is
very
very
drinkable
good
flavor
makes
this
big
time
drinkable
stella
appears
a
crystal
clear
corngold
head
the
super
thin
wispy
white
head
dissipates
almost
immediately
and
leaves
no
real
lace
behind
the
nose
has
a
very
light
pale
grainy
note
with
a
faint
herbal
hoppiness
just
making
itself
apparent
the
taste
is
no
better
theres
a
hint
of
bland
nondescript
sweetness
and
some
dms
flavors
and
an
almost
imperceptible
noble
hop
note
the
body
blows
past
light
and
lands
squarely
in
watery
territory
the
carbonation
at
least
is
fairly
decent
just
bubbly
enough
to
make
an
impression
to
be
honest
the
kindest
thing
i
can
say
about
stella
is
that
it
could
have
been
worse
i
only
ordered
it
because
its
on
the
list
for
the
cloverleafs
mba
program
and
i
dont
see
myself
getting
another
one
anytime
soon
mouthfeel
is
light
with
a
crisp
amount
of
carbonation
good
carbonation
light
crisp
even
with
being
a
touch
sweet
dusty
as
it
warms
twinge
of
acid
is
perfect
too
bad
the
beer
tastes
terrible
im
embarrassed
that
i
drank
half
of
one
of
these
straight
from
a
bottle
earlier
didnt
even
wince
jets
suck
d
to
hang
in
a
bar
this
one
does
the
trick
its
pleasant
to
the
senses
i
think
its
very
drinkable
on
tap
in
dark
supper
club
looked
about
what
stella
should
look
like
pale
yellow
clear
little
head
and
some
lacing
smelled
likestella
should
malt
and
unidentifiable
grains
tastes
like
a
stella
should
which
is
a
fairly
neutral
lager
easily
drinkable
and
leaves
little
aftertaste
the
best
part
very
drinkable
brought
to
me
in
a
plain
ol
glass
head
of
one
finger
maybe
it
was
sitting
for
a
while
before
it
was
brought
to
me
lace
at
the
very
top
of
the
glass
color
was
a
warm
yellow
teetering
on
orangebrown
judging
the
color
i
dont
even
know
if
it
was
a
stella
artois
smell
was
wheat
corn
malt
taste
was
a
little
heavy
for
a
pale
lager
but
had
flavors
of
roasted
wheat
oats
honey
barley
and
light
on
the
hops
very
thin
on
the
mouth
feel
category
more
like
watered
down
beer
than
beer
it
was
beer
i
just
dont
know
if
it
was
a
stella
artois
i
challenged
the
waiter
and
got
a
second
for
free
it
looked
and
tasted
the
same
all
around
this
pale
lager
was
much
easier
to
drink
than
i
had
led
myself
to
believe
and
with
the
average
abv
i
could
see
myself
spending
another
evening
with
stella
bought
on
a
whim
poured
into
my
ommegang
hennepin
goblet
first
thing
i
noticed
was
lack
of
any
head
very
pale
yellow
color
almost
clear
straw
smells
skunky
not
impressed
much
like
heineken
taste
is
smooth
watery
above
average
carbonation
hop
finish
is
a
little
strong
would
not
spend
my
money
on
this
again
harp
is
a
much
better
representation
of
the
style
food
match
roast
pork
roast
chicken
or
a
casserole
dish
as
for
vegetarians
fried
potatoes
green
beans
and
tofurkey
drinkability
even
without
a
slight
degree
of
skunkiness
that
did
eventually
fade
i
didnt
really
enjoy
this
beer
much
the
best
that
can
be
said
for
it
is
that
it
is
better
than
some
euro
pale
lagers
ive
had
and
no
worse
than
most
ill
probably
not
be
having
this
beer
again
and
honestly
the
only
reason
i
had
this
one
is
that
it
was
part
of
a
gift
package
this
beer
surprised
me
i
was
expecting
it
to
be
just
like
heineken
or
some
other
skunky
beer
but
it
actually
wasnt
all
that
bad
it
poured
and
looked
just
like
a
skunky
imported
beer
did
and
the
smell
wasnt
knock
your
socks
off
but
when
i
drank
it
it
wasnt
bad
it
has
a
nice
crisp
taste
a
little
bit
hoppy
a
little
bit
sweet
malt
taste
and
the
most
surprising
thing
was
that
there
was
very
little
skunk
to
speak
of
still
not
an
amazing
beer
i
would
say
average
but
for
sure
more
than
i
was
expecting
not
a
bad
beer
d
this
is
probably
one
of
the
most
drinkable
beers
on
the
planet
it
goes
down
easy
is
fairly
pleasant
tasting
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
and
sits
very
nicely
in
the
stomach
making
this
one
hell
of
a
sessionable
beer
yes
its
simple
yes
its
overpriced
but
once
you
get
over
that
its
not
so
bad
and
a
good
fridge
beer
stella
artois
has
become
quite
a
good
beer
it
is
very
good
for
a
widely
disributed
lager
beer
it
has
the
typical
average
yellow
color
mild
carbonation
minimal
head
a
somewhat
fragrant
aroma
and
goes
down
smooth
a
bit
pricy
at
most
bars
but
definitely
better
than
bud
or
coors
notes
i
like
it
its
not
great
but
id
drink
it
anyday
its
downfall
is
just
its
lack
of
character
and
boldness
my
friend
summed
this
beer
up
the
best
a
rich
mans
coors
light
inbev
ab
major
import
from
belgium
to
us
if
they
toned
down
the
strength
it
would
be
better
there
is
an
after
taste
that
i
can
not
pinpoint
but
it
doesnt
agree
with
me
i
have
had
in
belgium
before
and
dont
remember
such
a
poor
experience
maybe
if
they
make
it
local
it
would
be
fresher
d
goes
down
easy
stella
artois
was
pale
gold
in
color
with
excellent
clarity
it
had
a
thick
head
with
good
retention
and
lacing
the
smell
was
skunky
right
out
of
the
bottle
but
quickly
faded
leaving
light
malt
and
noble
hops
the
taste
was
light
malt
with
some
light
hops
and
a
little
bitterness
the
finish
was
dry
and
a
touch
bitter
the
mouthfeel
was
average
with
a
light
body
and
plenty
of
carbonation
drinkability
was
good
overall
its
a
pretty
good
euro
pale
lager
that
is
thirstquenching
and
refreshing
overall
it
is
about
as
average
as
average
can
get
for
a
euro
pale
lager
nothing
offensive
but
nothing
interesting
either
dont
understand
why
this
one
is
so
hyped
up
and
carries
a
high
price
tag
if
you
enjoy
beers
like
bud
coors
miller
etc
youd
like
this
one
too
nothing
groundbreaking
or
earth
shattering
just
a
very
drinkable
brew
lighter
medium
body
higher
carbonation
lingering
dryness
from
unpleasant
hop
profile
drinks
well
enough
to
throw
one
back
when
theres
nothing
else
available
or
for
a
nightcap
when
you
cant
taste
much
anymore
neither
of
these
are
good
qualities
sole
redeeming
quality
is
that
it
will
get
you
hammered
without
nextday
recriminations
cheers
a
little
carbonated
for
my
taste
but
not
offensive
overmarketed
bland
and
to
expensive

what

overall
its
a
good
bbq
session
beer
something
to
drink
a
lot
of
its
a
nice
looking
holiday
bottle
but
not
worth
the
effort
to
open
it
like
a
champagne
or
wine
bottle
if
i
ever
have
this
again
i
hope
its
in
a
regular
twelve
ounce
bottle
d
this
is
better
than
bud
or
miller
but
not
by
much
why
is
this
a
hip
beer
very
sessionable
do
well
if
you
want
to
go
there
drink
a
lot
of
these
at
5
it
is
very
doable
whether
youd
want
to
is
a
different
story
you
see
this
in
peoples
hands
because
they
think
theyre
beer
snobs
on
the
other

doesnt

it

by

pale
golden
lager
with

has

it
has

this

has

and

balance
finished
off
the
last
one
in
my
roommates
six
pack
with
dinner
tonight
had
a
pretty
standard
lager
appearance
not
too
bad
not
too
good
smells
pretty
standard
definitely
some
corngrain
in
there
i
wasnt
a
huge
fan
of
the
taste
it
tasted
a
lot
like
a
budweiser
to
me
decent
mouthfeel
it
was
pretty
light
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
but
it
went
down
smooth
overall
i
wouldnt
drink
more
of
2
of
these
in
a
night
just
bc
im
not
huge
on
the
taste
overall
the
best
ive
had
of
euro
pale
lagers
the
taste
is
light
grain
herbs
and
juniper
with
a
definite
light
bitterness
it
is
slightly
more
bitter
than
grolsch
or
heineken
it
is
slightly
tingly
and
has
a
lightly
bitter
the
finish
a
light
soapy
quality
is
noticeable
but
its
very
light
d
easy
drinking
not
bad
at
all
for
a
macro
though
below
average
for
being
a
belgian
had
this
at
my
next
door
neighbors
house
while
watching
football
it
poured
a
medium
yellow
color
with
an
ok
head
the
smell
was
bread
and
malt
faint
hops
the
taste
was
bready
with
faint
sweet
malts
and
a
few
hopsits
very
weak
and
watery
but
not
a
bad
lager
it
is
drinkable
if
that
what
you
want
ive
had
this
many
times
and
its
not
bad
its
just
not
one
i
think
about
ever
buying
but
if
its
in
the
cooler
ill
grab
one
when
i
tried
stella
previously
it
was
from
a
bottle
i
dont
think
id
be
inclined
to
ever
get
it
from
a
bottle
again
but
its
a
reasonable
brew
on
tap
definitely
worth
ordering
at
a
pizza
joint
with
a
limited
selection
had
this
beer
on
tap
in
the
european
union
area
of
brussels
the
beer
looks
like
a
typical
pilsner
with
a
nice
white
head
the
smell
is
nothing
special
had
this
one
after
the
jupiler
and
this
beer
is
so
much
better
for
the
style
this
is
not
sweet
in
the
after
taste
what
a
relief
also
this
pilsner
is
a
good
beer
for
a
hot
summer
day
but
fromin
belgium
one
should
basically
only
buydrink
the
special
treats
not
the
lager
beers
no
foul
aftertastes
a
very
crisp
and
light
feeling
beer
and
a
flavor
that
leaves
you
wanting
more
makes
this
beer
very
drinkable
i
am
quite
impressed
so
far
this
was
a
drinkable
beer
though
it
was
not
very
interesting
just
a
basic
euro
lager
definitely
sells
more
because
of
its
status
instead
of
its
taste
the
new
heineken
while
a
decent
beer
it
amazes
me
that
people
think
drinking
this
beer
proves
they
have
discerning
taste
typical
lager
for
snobs
theres
not
much
going
on
with
this
beer
how
can
you
comment
on
something
thats
almost
average
across
the
board
to
be
nice
ill
say
this
beer
is
insipid
thin
and
not
much
to
look
at
the
night
is
still
young
and
ive
got
plenty
of
real
beer
i
can
try
this
is
a
pretty
good
euro
lager
plus
it
looks
great
in
its
branded
glassware
this
is
a
good
looking
beer
golden
clear
with
a
nice
head
up
front
that
dissipates
quickly
the
aroma
is
faint
and
mellow
with
typical
belgian
elements
the
flavor
is
straightforward
european
lager
with
some
vegetal
notes
and
maybe
a
hint
of
weak
citrus
very
easy
to
drink
feels
good
going
down
and
i
could
drink
these
all
day
long
the
question
is
would
i
while
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
it
is
also
not
particularly
unique
or
interesting
this
beer
has
the
taste
equivalent
of
the
smell
of
dirty
feet
the
aftertaste
just
seem
to
stay
with
me
longer
than
necessary
i
struggled
to
finish
the
bottle
i
dont
even
think
i
finished
the
bottle
i
do
admit
that
it
was
better
than
a
heineken
but
i
wont
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
it
again
overall
not
terribly
offensive
but
still
one
of
the
worst
true
belgian
beers
ive
ever
had
overall
not
the
worst
macro
ive
ever
had
i
dont
really
recommend
too
many
macros
but
this
one
is
slightly
a
cut
above
i
suppose
not
very
exciting
though
to
say
the
least
i
had
this
taste
from
a
can
but
ive
had
plenty
of
these
on
tap
as
well
and
dont
remember
it
being
at
all
impressive
i
recommend
passing
on
the
stella
if
anything
else
is
available
d
this
is
clearly
an
overhyped
virally
marketed
beer
that
gives
belgian
beers
a
bad
name
behind
all
the
fancy
labels
and
longwinded
explanations
about
its
noble
heritage
lies
a
very
runofthemill
macro
lager
the
false
advertisement
and
inadequacy
in
the
taste
department
can
turn
inexperienced
beer
drinkers
away
from
belgian
beers
before
they
even
grasp
a
good
understanding
of
the
diversity
and
range
of
what
good
belgians
are
edit
im
to
understand
after
reviewing
this
beer
it
has
the
nickname
of
wifebeater
in
the
uk
now
i
dont
condone
domestic
violence
but
i
can
only
assume
the
reason
this
beer
has
that
nickname
is
because
if
i
had
a
wife
and
she
brought
me
a
bottle
of
this
stuff
id
be
pretty
damn
angry
if
i
had
to
drink
it
again
they
may
have
sold
out
to
the
masses
and
maybe
altered
the
taste
over
the
years
who
knows
but
this
is
a
solid
beer
that
is
consistant
and
always
refreshing
it
is
a
golden
lager
that
has
a
nice
light
foamy
head
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
are
simple
no
offputting
taste
just
a
nice
sweet
lager
that
can
be
enjoyed
anywhere
stella
is
a
very
drinkable
brand
and
they
do
a
very
good
job
on
getting
the
correct
glass
to
serve
it
in
im
not
a
fan
of
how
they
do
it
but
we
have
to
give
them
credit
for
getting
people
to
drink
better
beer
even
in
the
red
states
where
they
would
usually
drink
bud
not
what
i
think
of
when
i
hear
belgian
beer
but
better
than
our
macros
over
here
d
this
beer
is
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
and
while
it
doesnt
satisfy
my
palate
it
is
very
drinkable
nonetheless
i
would
take
this
over
bmc
any
day
and
could
drink
several
in
a
sitting
if
there
were
a
lack
of
better
options
strictly
speaking
about
the
beer
stellas
aroma
mouthfeel
and
aftertaste
are
in
the
same
boat
as
other
euro
lagers
heineken
grolsch
moretti
and
harp
nothing
impressive
here
just
standard
better
than
bud
lagers
belgium
has
unarguably
the
richest
terroir
when
it
comes
to
beers
it
is
home
to
some
of
the
oldest
and
most
unique
styles
and
possibly
the
largest
catalog
of
brands
as
well
it
shares
a
most
intimate
history
with
ale
and
houses
some
of
the
most
celebrated
breweries
and
timehonored
beers
belgiums
culture
is
inextricably
knotted
with
the
drink
but
apparently
not
even
all
that
exempts
it
from
the
plague
of
shitty
macroproduced
lagers

a
thick
band
of
lacing
as
it
collapsed
copious
tiny
bubbles
present
in

nose
was
somewhat
skunky
thats
it
taste
was
primarily
cereal
grains
very
light
and
wet
cardboard
with
a
little
bit
of
corn
syrup
sweetness
lingering
at
the
finish
mouthfeel
was
lightbodied
and
lightly
carbonated
probably
the
best
feature
of
this
brew
not
terrible
but
not
great
either
the
more
i
drank
this
the
less
appealing
it
was
pours
blonde
with
an
unremarkable
head
stella
has
a
skunky
smell
and
i
know
that
is
sometime
a
characteristic
not
spoilage
but
i
dont
have
to
like
it
the
taste
is
lagerish
in
other
words
plain
bland
common
mouth
feel
is
what
you
would
expect
in
a
lager
good
drinkability
i
like
this
a
better
on
tap
but
thats
not
unusual
when
properly
carbonated
pours
up
a
nice
brilliant
gold
with
a
big
frothy
bone
white
head
the
way
it
looks
in
the
glass
is
probably
its
best
attribute
the
smell
is
faintly
flowery
with
some
yeast
and
distant
honey
notes
the
taste
is
a
little
lemony
maybe
a
little
bit
of
pills
malt
and
some
mild
hops
in
the
finish
leaves
the
mouth
quickly
slightly
better
than
your
average
big
5
breweries
mass
lager
offering
but
only
slightly
pours
a
pale
gold
color
with
a
slight
head
the
smell
is
very
faint
there
is
a
slight
hop
aroma
but
it
is
more
of
an
adjunct
corn
smell
the
taste
is
very
crips
with
some
hop
bitterness
but
the
taste
of
hops
is
very
faint
as
well
mouthfeel
is
a
moderate
to
high
amount
of
carbonation
but
it
is
very
crisp
and
clean
drinkability
is
okay
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
nothing
to
make
you
run
away
either
d
if
i
was
at
a
bar
which
had
the
basic
domestic
offerings
and
then
stella
artois
i
would
pick
stella
however
for
any
other
situation
at
a
bar
i
would
never
buy
it
id
stick
to
microbrews
and
such
i
wasnt
thrilled
by
the
beer
however
i
wasnt
exactly
dissappointed
either
im
in
limbo
d
a
bit
of
character
if
you
can
manage
a
fresh
unskunked
sampling
a
bit
overrated
by
many
and
not
usually
worth
the
premium
price
but
i
found
this
fairly
cheap
and
it
drinks
reasonably
well
d
not
a
bad
option
when
youre
out
on
the
town
and
no
craft
options
are
available
solid
reliable
euro
lager
which
prob
gets
a
nice
bump
from
a
lot
of
great
beer
drinking
memories
together
dont
be
scared
of
this
brew
as
much
as
any
mainstream
lager
its
your
friend
o
its
not
bad
not
amazing
but
ill
drink
it
is
its
all
thats
available
so
if
you
want
a
solid
beer
while
kicking
it
at
the
bar
here
you
go
d
very
good
drinkability
goes
down
smooth
and
easy
the
sweetness
lets
this
beer
go
down
easier
than
other
lagers
after
a
couple
meals
with
this
beer
one
would
probably
seek
a
more
bitter
brew
however
d
good
drinkability
for
the
brew
overall
its
pretty
inoffensive
but
far
too
simple
and
pretty
poor
for
the
most
part
d
very
drinkable
goes
down
nice
with
a
good
carbonation
kick
drinkability
certainly
drinkable
as
the
abv
is
low
and
there
isnt
a
ton
of
flavor
so
it
certainly
goes
by
quickly
easy
to
drink
and
unoffensive
on
the
palate
but
there
are
so
many
beers
out
there
why
would
you
ever
settle
for
stella
d
very
drinkable
its
easy
to
have
quit
a
bit
of
these
d
its
amazing
how
a
sixer
of
pbr
can
make
a
typical
euro
lager
seem
like
the
nectar
of
the
gods
but
this
one
stands
on
its
own
quite
nicely
it
wont
make
anyone
forget
rochefort
or
any
other
of
the
fine
offerings
from
belgium
but
its
a
solid
lager
i
sesioned
this
beer
in
qatar
while
on
rest
and
relaxation
from
the
boredom
of
iraq
i
loved
it
best
beer
the
uso
offered
however
now
that
i
have
been
home
and
had
other
brews
i
have
to
say
i
wont
be
sessioning
this
beer
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
while
sitting
around
the
barbeque
waiting
for
the
ribs
to
get
done
d
to
me
this
is
just
an
average
beer
im
not
real
big
on
lagers
so
i
wouldnt
normally
want
too
many
of
these
in
a
sitting
however
it
has
to
be
one
of
the
better
lagers
not
a
horrible
euro
lager
but
not
a
good
belgian
beer
either
decent
carbonation
and
mediumlighter
body
make
this
much
more
passable
as
a
drink
it
went
down
easy
with
the
food
what
can
i
say
airport
beer
choices
just
flat
out
suck
ass
and
this
was
the
best
available
i
wouldnt
pursue
this
unless
you
had
no
other
choice
a
fairly
boring
beer
approachable
but
boring
overall
i
would
say
this
beer
is
drinkable
but
not
great
it
is
definitely
not
what
comes
to
mind
when
one
thinks
of
belgian
beer
this
is
certainly
a
very
good
beer
i
tend
to
be
more
into
darker
beers
but
even
for
someone
who
is
into
a
darker
brew
its
still
a
nice
and
refreshing
brew
its
a
very
light
and
extremely
crisp
taste
probably
good
for
serving
someone
if
they
are
not
much
of
a
beer
person
id
have
to
try
this
one
on
tap
to
truly
put
my
mind
to
ease
i
guess
i
am
totally
turned
off
by
the
green
bottles
its
like
playing
a
reverse
lottery
where
everyone
wins
a
skunky
beer
stella
is
an
average
beer
at
best
and
i
just
dont
see
the
popularity
with
it
at
bars
across
the
country
i
guess
having
ab
importing
and
distributing
helps
ill
pass
from
now
on
d
not
my
fave
but
passable
and
pretty
drinkable
when
selection
is
limited
this
is
one
to
go
with
if
its
on
tap
with
little
craft
or
macro
selection
poured
from
a
green
bottle
into
a
weizen
glass
has
a
rich
golden
color
with
a
smallish
head
not
much
in
the
way
of
aroma
has
good
delicious
slightly
malty
flavor
with
a
mild
aftertaste
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
is
highly
drinkable
this
is
very
enjoyable
brew
mouthfeel
medium
bodied
with
a
sharp
carbonation
pours
clear
pale
yellow
a
little
watery
and
weak
looking
nice
carbonation
and
bone
white
head
that
quickly
lays
down
a
little
of
that
sour
eurolager
aroma
that
sometimes
hits
me
a
little
skunky
but
not
in
this
bottle
taste
is
watery
but
also
crisp
and
refreshing
sweet
malts
balanced
nicely
by
sour
hops
a
little
flint
and
grass
but
not
unpleasant
clean
bitter
finish
no
off
flavors
this
is
my
favorite
of
the
megaproduced
euro
lagers
give
me
a
mainstream
adjunct
lager
instead
i
dont
see
the
hype
or
the
quality
overall
i
found
this
to
be
a
hohum
beer
almost
all
other
belgian
beers
i
have
tried
have
been
superior
although
admittedly
this
one
isnt
too
pricey
and
i
would
even
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
a
lot
of
belgianstyle
beers
trump
it
not
terrible
to
drink
but
certainly
falls
into
the
class
of
beers
i
would
consider
about
tier
2
out
of
five
with
only
things
like
laker
being
lower
drinkabilitythis
has
never
been
a
favorite
beer
of
mine
but
its
an
easy
beer
to
drink
drinkability
not
a
bad
beer
i
enjoy
drinking
it
do
not
recommend
it
as
a
quality
beer
but
would
enjoy
drinking
it
on
a
nice
day
md
slightly
bitter
with
a
light
feel
easily
drinkable
the
verdict
is
this
stella
is
a
sessionable
euro
lager
end
of
story
another
one
of
the
first
euro
imports
that
got
me
on
the
path
to
better
beer
so
perhaps
it
gets
a
slight
bump
in
my
overall
score
category
for
nostalgic
reasons
true
it
might
not
be
the
best
euro
lager
but
it
hits
the
spot
on
hot
days
when
drinking
with
fraternity
brothers
a
good
friend
just
got
back
from
belgium
on
spring
break
after
spending
a
semester
abroad
studying
in
leuven
where
the
brewery
is
located
and
he
says
this
beer
is
markedly
better
overseas
because
it
is
so
much
fresher
d
very
drinkable
love
this
beer
great
for
sessioning
good
work
belgium
drinkability
definitely
a
good
beer
the
ba
c
average
is
definitely
unwaranted
good
beer
but
a
bit
expensive
md
very
dry
on
the
taste
buds
and
rolls
over
the
the
tongue
very
smoothly
with
no
real
problem
this
beer
is
drinkable
in
every
way
but
the
price
good
beer
but
ive
had
better
the
smell
was
pretty
much
the
same
pungent
and
light
hops
but
the
taste
however
was
so
much
different
it
was
really
bready
and
yeasty
with
some
subtle
citrus
notes
towards
the
end
it
was
incredibly
drinkable
that
night
more
than
the
previous
sessions
i
thought
it
was
pretty
tasty
for
such
a
skunky
beer
it
mustve
been
a
gem
supply
because
i
had
not
enjoyed
stella
in
my
previous
tastings
overall
id
say
stella
is
an
average
drinkable
beer
as
id
consider
looking
for
other
options
mouthfeel
is
thin
carbonation
is
crisp
and
if
not
for
the
off
flavors
would
be
a
good
quencher
poured
an
extra
light
straw
color
impeccable
clear
with
the
faintest
white
head
smells
like
cat
urine
watered
down
hops
and
a
college
bar
the
day
after
st
patricks
day
taste
is
surprisingly
spot
on
with
the
smell
feels
like
drinking
seltzer
water
absolutely
no
body
drinkability
is
low
seeing
as
i
want
to
gag
every
time
it
hits
my
tongue
d
meh
i
guess
i
could
throw
a
few
back
but
for
the
price
of
the
stuff
i
dont
think
its
really
worth
it
just
another
expensive
mass
marketed
import
im
not
impressed
at
all
its
sad
to
think
that
people
think
of
this
beer
to
signify
belgium
time
to
get
out
there
and
educate
people
d
pretty
average
when
it
comes
to
drinkability
its
no
better
or
no
worse
than
your
buds
millers
and
coors

pretty
bad
cheaptasting
lager
in
my
opinion
stella
artois
is
about
on
par
with
most
american
macro
lagers
theres
very
little
to
recommend
it
the
color
is
a
pale
drab
yellow
the
small
white
head
dissipates
very
quickly
theres
little
aroma
except
for
a
muted
cheap
malt
note
overly
sweet
and
more
reminiscent
of
corn
than
barley
although
i
dont
believe
that
adjuncts
are
used
the
flavor
is
similarly
dominated
by
a
cheap
overly
sweet
malt
flavor
there
are
some
hops
in
there
i
guess
the
beer
is
not
entirely
without
crispness
when
cold
still
the
feel
is
rather
thin
even
for
a
lager
probably
based
on
a
pilsner
style
overall
im
not
a
fan
of
stella
the
flavor
is
unclean
which
is
a
pretty
big
problem
for
me
in
a
light
lager
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
a
definite
improvement
over
most
of
the
abinbev
library
overall
this
is
just
a
fair
beer
its
drinkable
pairs
well
with
any
seafood
or
poultry
however
it
does
have
that
euro
lager
skunkiness
that
heineken
alot
of
other
brews
have
drinkable
in
the
way
that
most
massmarket
beers
are
and
better
than
someout
this
one
and
i
dont
think
id
want
more
than
a
couple
as
there
are
plenty
of
better
beers
out
there
stella
is
one
of
those
lagers
which
you
feel
bad
not
finding
something
good
to
say
about
it
because
it
certainly
is
a
step
up
from
budcoorsetc
but
it
certainly
doesnt
offer
anything
too
special
smell
and
taste
are
sort
of
just
your
avg
beer
taste
like
an
adjuct
lager
but
it
has
at
least
some
flavor
and
a
hint
of
citrusy
even
lime
specifically
that
i
find
in
its
mild
hop
presence
its
main
strong
points
are
the
light
mouthfeel
and
easy
drinkability
what
i
assume
most
people
who
go
for
one
are
looking
for
anyway
this
beer
has
a
much
nicer
color
than
a
lot
of
the
other
macro
eurotrash
beers
in
fact
its
clearly
the
color
of
very
very
light
maple
syrup
smells
pretty
skunky
unfortunately
thats
the
problem
with
a
green
bottle
i
really
dont
hate
this
beer
in
fact
i
like
it
except
for
the
dry
paper
taste
at
the
end
its
def
at
the
better
end
of
the
belgium
macro
brews
and
if
i
had
to
choose
one
well
i
wouldnt
but
this
one
is
better
than
the
rest
i
could
pound
a
few
back
on
a
summer
day
had
to
drink
this
at
a
party
so
i
thought
i
would
review
beer
pourse
a
very
light
yellow
color
hardly
any
head
and
no
lacing
smell
is
good
with
the
aroma
of
sweet
malt
with
light
hops
taste
is
of
sweet
malt
up
front
followed
by
subdued
hop
flavor
beer
finishes
too
bitterharsh
for
me
and
reminds
me
more
of
an
ale
than
a
lager
its
not
a
bad
beer
just
not
up
to
par
with
many
of
the
other
fine
german
lagers
out
there
d
low
alcohol
but
not
good
enough
for
multiple
appearences
i
did
not
even
finish
my
glass
i
dont
see
why
this
is
so
popular
oh
yeah
inbev
i
forgot
its
easy
enough
to
drink
but
this
is
strictly
a
hot
weather
beer
in
my
opinion
not
bad
just
not
that
good
either
drinkability
i
have
very
few
complaints
about
this
beer
it
looks
and
smells
like
nothing
but
it
tastes
good
and
it
goes
down
easy
and
i
say
this
after
i
fully
expected
to
hate
this
beer
good
stuff
a
pale
golden
color
with
a
big
fluffy
white
head
lots
of
carbonation
aroma
of
grain
and
skunky
hops
with
a
dash
of
citrus
fruit
aroma
flavor
is
a
touch
of
pale
malt
up
front
then
a
neutral
carbonation
and
then
some
citrusskunky
hops
light
body
with
a
crisp
refreshing
mouthfeel
and
finishquite
drinkableand
a
fun
try
but
not
the
best
ive
ever
had
taste
is
not
too
shabby
with
grainy
pale
malts
shouldering
most
of
the
load
moderately
hopped
with
saaz
to
give
it
a
decent
floral
and
spicy
hop
presence
its
well
carbonated
with
a
dry
finish
if
this
is
the
budweiser
of
belgium
id
trade
macros
with
them
anyday
one
of
the
better
euro
pale
lagers
i
have
had
for
me
however
the
price
is
way
to
high
for
this
beer
to
warrant
any
regular
purchasing
d
stella
is
a
pretty
good
brew
that
is
drinkable
but
not
the
best
one
out
there
here
in
the
us
this
beer
is
no
longer
a
novelty
you
can
find
it
everywhere
and
maybe
thats
not
a
bad
thing
beats
the
hell
out
of
bmc
anyday
d
beer
pong
beer
crisp
and
clean
kind
of
boring
though
drinkability
a
few
cans
like
this
in
an
evening
is
never
a
bad
thing
just
dont
overdo
it
the
taste
and
refreshment
doesnt
go
out
on
this
great
beer
i
had
this
on
tap
at
a
local
restaraunt
it
is
a
pale
clear
straw
yellow
with
a
medium
white
head
and
a
bit
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
bready
the
flavor
is
light
sweet
and
has
a
pleasant
bitter
after
taste
the
beer
is
light
bodied
and
fairly
quaffable
i
think
this
one
is
much
better
on
draft
than
bottled
drinkability
honestly
i
like
this
beer
its
first
time
i
tried
it
and
i
think
its
a
nice
session
lager
better
then
most
macro
beers
its
gotta
alot
more
complexity
to
me
while
steal
being
very
light
crisp
and
refreshing
then
most
american
macros
not
something
i
would
get
all
the
time
but
if
given
the
option
theres
a
lot
i
would
certainly
choose
it
over
one
i
believe
i
will
visit
occasionally
when
drinking
with
people
who
like
the
macros
highly
drinkable
no
issues
slamming
one
these
down
d
i
would
not
get
this
again
d
3
5
i
gotta
support
it
since
its
belgian
its
drinkable
for
sure
just
not
a
huge
standout
for
me
overall
this
is
a
good
alternative
to
the
american
pale
lagers
seems
a
bit
more
flavorful
and
full
the
best
thing
is
that
it
is
quite
drinkable
but
might
not
ever
be
my
first
choice
at
a
bar
i
would
definitely
pick
it
over
any
budweiser
or
miller
though
at
least
its
better
than
bud
overall
ive
always
liked
this
beer
nothing
special
about
it
just
always
seems
to
hit
the
spot
poured
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
flute
glass
pours
a
clear
crisp
golden
yellow
with
lots
of
bubbles
a
one
finger
thick
white
head
that
settles
quickly
the
first
thing
i
smell
is
a
bit
of
funk
that
i
cant
identify
not
real
pleasant
beyond
that
it
smells
mildly
malty
and
fruity
a
bit
of
a
sweet
taste
up
front
followed
by
a
bit
of
bitterness
not
a
real
complicated
taste
but
well
balanced
crisp
light
mouthfeel
very
carbonated
and
burpy
goes
down
easy
though
its
drinkable
when
your
options
are
limited
not
bad
not
great
but
drinkable
stella
poured
clear
and
gold
with
a
one
finger
head
that
stuck
nicely
to
the
side
of
the
glass
its
aroma
was
crisp
and
malty
which
was
reflected
in
its
taste
i
love
carbonation
and
this
one
had
plenty
which
complemented
its
smoothness
this
is
a
very
easy
beer
to
drink
really
nice
atmosphere
on
this
one
nice
full
flavor
and
feel
however
a
light
palette
really
solid
quaff
overall
i
was
not
into
stella
at
first
but
it
grew
on
me
by
the
bottom
of
the
glass
it
holds
its
own
but
i
wont
seek
it
out
poured
a
nice
clear
golden
amber
with
a
white
frothy
head
that
dissolved
to
a
cover
well
carbonated
little
aroma
but
not
unpleasant
clean
dry
taste
mildly
bitter
easy
to
drink
not
usually
my
first
choice
but
drink
it
when
its
the
alternative
to
bmc
drinkability
is
limited
by
taste
overall
this
is
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
not
terribly
notable
but
does
have
a
decent
taste
and
is
pretty
inoffensive
can
see
why
it
is
so
popular
among
those
looking
for
an
easy
drinking
lager
overall
average
pale
lager
clean
and
drinkable
drinkability
its
drinkable
id
rather
drink
this
than
most
us
macros
but
this
is
usually
just
a
ritual
beer
at
certain
concert
venues
d
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
this
will
probably
be
the
last
one
of
these
i
ever
buy
there
are
a
lot
more
interesting
choices
out
there
then
this
swill
this
beer
is
probably
well
liked
by
folks
enjoying
lighter
easier
drinking
beers
i
think
is
would
be
great
on
a
hot
summer
day
drinkability
is
fairly
high
on
this
one
its
nice
refreshing
and
clean
not
something
im
clamouring
to
get
more
of
but
decent
overall
i
cant
see
myself
ever
getting
this
again
d
not
bad
i
named
my
dog
after
this
beer
so
people
always
ask
me
if
its
one
of
my
favorites
but
its
actually
just
halfway
decent
and
nothing
special
i
just
liked
the
name
since
it
is
beerrelated
and
im
a
big
beer
geek
it
was
my
wifes
idea
actually
i
was
surprised
that
this
beer
was
not
as
bad
as
expected
being
a
macro
beer
it
is
expected
to
be
alittle
less
then
they
hype
not
too
bad
i
would
consider
putting
this
on
my
list
of
session
beers
taste
is
likewise
a
bit
reduced
and
downright
watery
in
the
end
thus
negatively
impacting
the
feel
and
drinkability
of
this
brew
if
you
wish
to
consume
this
beer
and
i
cant
really
recommend
it
then
you
should
purchase
the
bottle
not
a
drinkable
beer
in
my
opinion
so
many
great
beers
out
there
i
wouldnt
waste
my
time
with
this
quite
honestly
if
this
was
the
best
beer
offered
at
a
bar
id
rather
drink
water
or
a
coke
i
could
not
manage
to
drink
the
whole
beer
and
gave
up
after
half
to
think
that
i
used
to
drink
this
while
at
um
places
that
involved
consuming
a
formidable
amount
of
mixed
drinks
power
hour
before
nursing
beers
the
remainder
of
the
evening
and
this
was
the
best
option
really
now
while
not
blatantly
offputting
its
not
particularly
enjoyable
when
put
to
this
particular
litmus
test
ill
still
finish
this
in
deference
to
those
heady
days
where
beertubs
were
a
going
concern
for
me
md
very
light
bodied
and
crisp
a
touch
thin
on
the
feel
but
a
very
quaffable
lager
nothing
spectacular
but
a
decent
beer
none
the
less
overall
i
was
disappointed
this
was
recommended
to
me
by
several
people
and
i
ended
up
being
very
disappointed
this
just
seems
like
an
upgraded
of
bud
or
bud
light
not
at
all
enjoyable
stella
was
ubiquitous
when
i
was
in
belgium
several
years
ago
and
i
didnt
like
it
then
even
when
very
fresh
i
like
it
less
now
d
a
good
light
easy
beer
for
thirsty
drinking
d
good
beer
never
had
in
the
bottle
in
the
states
but
enjoyed
it
over
there

drinkability
is
high
for
me
stilll
because
i
found
it
a
fun
beer
and
the
skunkiness
isnt
overpowering
not
bad
pours
a
clear
pale
yellow
with
a
bright
white
12
inch
head
decent
retention
and
only
slight
lacing
smells
of
a
lager
with
some
sweet
malt
but
mostly
skunk
all
of
the
stellas
ive
ever
had
have
this
distinctive
skunk
aroma
and
taste
i
hope
this
is
just
the
shipping
process
and
not
the
actual
flavor
i
wish
to
travel
abroad
and
sample
fresh
examples
of
these
european
brews
has
a
crisp
feel
with
low
carbonation
and
a
little
to
watery
definitely
not
strong
enough
for
me
to
enjoy
and
the
skunk
aroma
is
also
present
in
the
taste
overall
i
only
tried
this
again
to
make
sure
i
get
the
rating
correct
i
have
never
enjoyed
any
skunky
brews
d
another
of
my
favorite
dependable
bbq
summer
beers
i
dont
buy
it
otherwise
d
good
to
say
you
like
a
belgian
beer
but
that
is
about
it
really
boring
also
it
is
not
cheap
i
would
rather
grab
some
american
craft
beer
not
bad
by
any
stretch
just
not
that
interesting
its
not
a
memorable
beer
but
its
a
pleasant
one
too
bad
about
the
price
i
enjoy
this
lager
very
crisp
and
refreshing
on
a
warm
summer
day
and
will
warm
you
up
a
bit
in
the
pit
of
winter
not
very
bitter
and
sweeter
than
most
which
is
a
good
thing
in
my
book
for
being
a
mass
produced
import
euro
lager
its
top
of
the
line
this
beer
gets
a
lot
of
underserved
attention
pours
clear
yellow
with
an
outofcontrol
white
head
aroma
is
reminiscent
of
heineken
skunkysweet
with
the
taste
of
bread
almost
as
if
someone
dropped
sugar
into
a
budweiser
the
finish
is
sickeningsweet
not
a
fan
notes
bbcsde1
this
beer
is
just
kinda
ok
for
me
its
good
but
taste
more
like
a
american
adjuct
than
a
euro
pale
just
not
worth
the
89
a
6pack
price
i
would
pay
67
a
6pack
but
not
much
more
not
something
ill
buy
again
unless
maybe
on
sale
im
underimpressed
by
this
beer
a
decent
casual
drinker
i
guess
but
i
could
find
plenty
of
better
beers
for
the
same
price
and
popularity
i
wouldnt
order
this
at
a
restaurant
or
bar
and
wouldnt
recommend
this
to
anyone
but
id
drink
it
happily
if
someone
gave
it
to
me
i
bought
this
beer
at
the
liquor
store
as
a
single
on
advice
of
a
friend
this
is
my
first
beer
probably
go
back
and
re
rate
it
i
used
the
stella
artois
glass
a
light
and
crisp
beer
pale
in
color
with
bit
of
citrus
and
light
hops
not
a
great
beer
but
just
okay
leftovers
from
a
party
so
i
drank
a
bottle
last
night
poured
it
into
a
stella
glass
have
a
set
of
four
its
a
nice
glass
crisp
yellow
color
fairly
large
white
head
lots
of
carbonation
first
thing
i
always
notice
with
a
stella
is
that
funky
smell
its
borderline
skunky
masked
by
the
sweet
smell
of
corn
not
a
fan
of
the
smell
of
this
beer
taste
is
average
not
the
worst
euro
lager
ive
had
theres
an
odd
slickness
to
this
beers
body
almost
buttery
this
sorta
slicks
over
the
marginal
taste
of
this
beer
not
a
brew
that
i
want
to
have
more
than
one
of
if
given
no
other
choice
dgood
enough
drinkability
by
no
means
an
all
star
but
an
enjoyable
lager
to
be
sure
update
was
purchased
in
a
single
bottle
try
the
closed
case
12
packs
to
block
the
light
from
spoiling
the
beer
iv
noticed
that
it
makes
a
big
difference
i
will
try
again
sometime
and
update
my
review
if
i
notice
any
difference
stella
artois
pours
a
clear
yellow
with
tons
of
carbonation
rushing
to
the
top
and
a
clean
white
head
that
lasts
a
couple
of
minutes
all
in
all
it
looks
quite
beautiful
unfortunately
the
smell
is
between
ick
and
ordinary
theres
just
not
much
there
a
faint
nameless
hoppiness
with
the
suggestion
of
an
equally
unidentifiable
malt
tastes
slightly
better
than
it
smells
with
distant
honey
sweetness
and
lemony
hops
reminiscent
of
camomille
and
just
as
benign
the
body
is
light
and
the
carbonation
gives
it
a
nice
feel
this
beer
is
pretty
drinkable
but
would
be
more
so
if
only
it
had
more
character
i
had
this
in
the
traditional
stella
artois
snifter
which
probably
didnt
make
much
of
a
difference
even
if
i
had
drunk
it
straight
from
the
bottle
as
i
often
have
the
color
is
a
sort
of
hazy
gold
with
a
light
head
this
beer
doesnt
have
much
taste
to
it
at
all
so
its
hard
to
fault
stella
on
bad
taste
but
at
the
same
time
its
extraordinarily
plain
an
easier
import
to
drink
when
there
arent
any
other
imported
lagers
around
in
reality
i
can
sum
this
up
by
saying
its
heineken
becks
grolsch
etc
brewed
and
bottled
in
belgium
rather
typical
of
the
european
lagers
that
find
their
way
to
our
stores
the
pour
was
initially
impressive
with
a
fluffy
cotton
white
head
but
even
that
went
away
as
time
wore
on
this
is
very
drinkable
and
soft
on
the
palate
pretty
basic
and
soon
forgotten
average
lager
d
good
drinkablity
if
it
wasnt
skunked
i
might
like
to
have
a
few
this
is
a
good
session
beer
if
i
want
a
refreshing
beer
this
would
work
well
not
my
style
at
all
but
do
able
i
will
buy
again
because
my
wife
like
them
i
drank
this
on
tap
in
england
years
ago
and
really
enjoyed
it
the
bottle
i
reviewed
was
unimpressive
and
imho
terrible
for
a
highly
touted
belgian
drinkability
not
so
hot
if
only
because
its
almost
cloyingly
sweet
and
not
a
complex
sweetness
but
a
sticky
simple
sweetness
alcohols
fine
wellhidden
but
its
just
not
pleasant
enough
to
bring
me
back
for
much
more
i
ended
up
handing
this
one
back
to
the
friend
served
ontap
in
a
pint
glass
once
we
started
to
drink
this
we
were
unsure
why
we
ordered
it
and
why
we
thought
we
liked
it
the
beer
was
a
clear
very
pale
yellow
with
a
thin
white
head
left
some
decent
lacing
but
that
alone
will
not
improve
its
score
no
real
aroma
to
it
the
taste
was
awful
watered
down
carbonation
was
ok
but
it
was
very
thin
and
had
no
character
to
it
we
could
not
finish
the
pint
enough
said
one
of
the
summer
hot
day
beers
drinkability
not
terrible
but
definitely
not
worth
the
price
i
would
drink
it
if
it
was
around
but
i
dont
think
that
this
is
anything
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
buy
again
poured
to
a
very
light
yellow
and
a
two
fingered
head
head
was
white
in
color
left
some
lacing
along
the
glass
as
it
was
consumed
had
the
skunk
smell
as
it
was
opened
reminded
me
of
heineken
also
smelled
of
malt
had
a
slightly
skunk
taste
also
some
grain
actually
was
very
light
tasting
nothing
strong
at
all
i
expected
a
stronger
taste
than
what
it
actualy
had
felt
good
in
the
mouth
very
light
carbonation
was
good
overall
i
think
this
brew
was
good
would
like
to
try
a
session
with
it
ill
buy
again
the
palest
yellow
color
two
finger
white
head
that
recedes
rather
quickly
butleaving
some
nice
lacing
i
cant
help
but
chuckle
to
myself
that
is
was
poured
into
a
bud
light
pint
glass
aroma
of
skunk
pale
malts
very
dry
and
slightly
hoppy
grainy
husk
malt
flavor
a
little
skunk
again
average
hop
bitterness
but
for
than
the
nose
would
lead
you
to
believe
crisp
and
clean
on
the
tongue
this
used
to
be
my
expensive
beer
before
i
got
into
the
world
of
crafts
i
enjoy
it
still
despite
my
quest
for
bigger
and
better
beers
easy
to
drink
and
i
still
like
this
one
on
a
hot
summer
day
in
wisconsins
countryside
m
d
a
reasonable
even
somewhat
rich
carbonation
which
complements
the
body
fairly
well
it
may
not
stand
out
against
others
but
its
very
accessible
and
drinkability
isnt
an
issue
other
than
being
a
mood
thing
in
terms
of
aromaflavour
or
lack
thereof
i
can
do
this
one
without
complaints
had
a
crisp
bitter
mouthfeel
and
about
the
same
in
the
finish
wasnt
a
bad
beer
just
nothing
to
write
home
about
particular
for
a
premium
beer
mouthfeel
was
somewhat
raspy
which
i
like
mediumlight
body
found
a
six
pack
of
this
on
sale
at
the
market
for
8
i
usually
see
it
at
around
1213
for
a
sixer
so
i
thought
id
give
it
a
shot
if
youre
looking
for
a
beer
with
decent
taste
and
pretty
good
drinkability
go
ahead
and
pick
some
up
if
you
can
find
it
on
sale
otherwise
its
not
worth
the
price
poured
a
nice
light
gold
with
good
carbonation
nose
is
refreshing
a
little
grainy
but
not
bad
taste
has
good
malts
slightly
hopped
with
a
very
light
sweetcitrus
notevery
light
pretty
good
overall
drinkability
easy
drinking
beer
that
i
contantly
choose
when
out
its
starting
to
take
over
heineken
in
populartity
now
d
yuck
there
havent
been
many
beers
that
i
havent
finished
because
they
were
just
that
bad
but
this
was
one
of
them
maybe
a
tap
problem
who
knows
but
this
was
one
of
the
worst
things
to
hit
my
lips
in
awhile
perhaps
the
flavors
of
the
beer
dont
do
well
with
an
ontap
translation
golden
yellow
lager
with
a
sort
of
small
white
head
that
fizzles
out
rather
quickly
smells
semisweet
and
grainy
a
little
malty
no
hoppyness
in
the
smell
but
a
little
bit
of
hop
bitterness
in
the
flavor
pleasant
and
clean
tasting
lager
it
tastes
like
it
was
brewed
from
quality
ingredients
but
its
not
worth
the
tendollarpersixpack
price
tag
no
poor
aftertaste
its
definitely
better
than
budweiser
but
not
worth
the
price
to
me
drinkability
well
low
abv
crispness
and
lightness
lend
itself
to
excelling
in
this
category
not
my
main
choice
for
a
refreshing
beer
but
its
not
bad
its
a
better
version
of
heineken
id
say
the
flavors
in
this
are
a
little
more
balanced
out
d
best
thing
about
this
beer
easy
to
pound
but
ive
had
better
its
the
budweiser
of
premium
imports
nouse
aroma
is
lightly
malty
grain
moderately
hoppy
herbs
light
note
of
solvent
smells
and
tastes
a
bit
industrial
comment
a
fairly
easy
drinking
beer
with
some
very
mild
flavors
a
good
beer
i
remember
this
being
better
it
is
pale
yellow
with
minimal
head
doesnt
look
any
different
than
the
typical
keg
party
beer
minimal
smell
one
taste
i
picked
up
that
was
a
little
different
was
bubble
gum
i
had
this
beer
at
the
end
of
the
night
because
i
had
a
few
too
many
heavy
beers
and
wanted
something
a
little
lighter
this
really
isnt
any
better
than
any
cheap
american
alternative
dont
pay
extra
for
it
this
is
a
beer
that
i
would
enjoy
at
local
bar
and
or
at
a
get
together
with
friends
i
will
definitely
drink
this
beer
again
notes
a
good
fresh
stella
well
have
a
good
delicate
and
somewhat
dry
flavor
that
pairs
well
with
food
in
place
of
dry
white
wine
d
not
very
flavorful
goes
down
ok
not
very
filling
decent
kick
since
i
didnt
really
find
much
difference
between
this
beer
and
many
of
the
macros
out
there
i
would
choose
most
of
them
first
simply
because
theyre
cheaper
this
beer
didnt
give
me
much
of
a
reason
to
select
it
again
d
good
drinkability
above
and
beyond
an
easy
session
easy
recommend
and
one
of
the
cleanest
tasting
lagers
ive
tasted
a
prime
example
by
style
i
was
able
to
pound
three
down
rather
quickly
but
that
isnt
the
point
save
your
money
and
buy
something
else
unless
of
course
your
friend
is
willing
to
shell
out
the
coin
for
you
to
drink
this
wonderful
drink
from
my
homeland
drinkability
is
average
but
the
hangover
is
even
higher
in
north
america
if
youre
going
to
spend
this
amount
of
money
you
can
do
much
better
i
like
stella
for
what
it
is
its
an
easy
to
find
solid
session
beer
golden
colored
lightbodied
this
beer
goes
down
very
smooth
with
very
little
aftertaste
refreshing
slightly
grainy
and
sweet
tasting
id
say
this
one
is
ideal
for
sitting
out
in
the
sun
and
again
not
a
bad
session
lager
this
beer
is
sold
in
just
about
every
pubtavern
in
the
area
i
never
felt
motivated
to
drink
it
until
yesterday
the
best
that
i
can
say
about
this
beer
is
that
it
is
unremarkable
and
unoffensive
i
dont
even
think
it
is
as
complex
as
heineken
which
isnt
saying
very
much
the
best
i
can
say
about
this
beer
is
that
if
i
wanted
to
drink
a
ton
of
mass
produced
lager
it
could
be
this
it
may
be
a
good
crossover
beer
from
people
looking
to
finally
mature
enough
to
step
away
from
the
miller
lite
bud
lite
crowd
so
i
decided
to
try
stella
again
through
my
many
past
sips
i
always
deemed
it
a
failure
of
massive
wellmarketed
proportions
and
i
havent
touched
it
since
my
first
ba
review
of
the
stuff
but
after
many
a
friend
argued
of
its
euro
lager
superiority
over
say
grolsch
i
figured
id
give
it
a
shot
and
it
was
mediocre
which
is
a
huge
step
up
from
the
atrocity
that
it
was
the
last
time
i
checked
maybe
some
of
them
actually
are
skunked
and
its
not
just
the
flavor
in
any
case
its
an
okay
beer
fairly
smooth
with
some
mild
skunkiness
bodys
thin
and
not
too
interesting
and
the
carbonations
pretty
high
crisp
and
nonetooterrible
if
youre
feeling
thirsty
but
also
wanna
get
drunk
d
for
me
pretty
low
for
those
youre
trying
to
ween
of
bud
light
high
d
most
people
would
not
like
but
a
nice
euro
take
on
a
lager
style
i
think
what
i
said
in
the
drinkability
section
describes
it
best
it
goes
down
great
but
its
too
expensive
to
justify
doing
that
i
really
didnt
think
there
was
a
whole
lot
of
character
to
it
it
seems
to
be
just
a
pretty
clean
beer
overall
im
not
too
disappointed
but
im
not
really
impressed
by
it
either
however
its
not
nearly
as
godawful
as
that
kronenbourg
1664
which
i
believe
is
of
a
similar
style
so
my
rating
should
reflect
that
drinkability
is
actually
quite
high
on
these
for
me
its
light
smooth
and
goes
down
easily
i
could
session
these
but
theyre
too
overpriced
for
me
d
even
if
you
dont
want
to
think
about
or
taste
your
beer
i
would
suggest
something
else
this
stuff
tends
to
be
a
bit
pricey
why
on
earth
is
this
beer
so
popular
the
flavor
isnt
particularly
good
and
it
isnt
any
more
refreshing
than
a
say
a
session
lager
whatever
to
each
his
own
this
is
a
fine
lager
it
has
a
golden
yellow
color
a
yeasty
slight
hop
aroma
nice
head
the
taste
is
a
nice
light
crisp
lager
with
a
mild
hop
flavor
great
with
food
it
has
excellent
effervesence
with
a
light
inviting
mouthfeel
a
very
drinkable
beer
d
it
is
a
bit
overrated
by
the
main
stream
but
you
could
serve
much
worse
at
a
picnic
or
bbq
will
go
with
any
kind
of
bbq
and
has
some
flavor
qualities
d
this
is
not
a
beer
snobs
beer
for
sure
easy
to
drink
but
just
not
that
good
not
a
bad
choice
but
im
not
sure
its
worth
the
premium
price
vs
american
macros
drinkability
not
quite
reprehensible
but
notable
for
its
blandness
and
lack
of
character
its
very
easy
to
drink
this
is
a
very
inoffensive
nonchallenging
beer
its
nice
but
for
my
taste
a
bit
ordinary
its
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
and
its
well
worth
your
while
to
try
it
if
youre
accustomed
to
massmarket
lagers
and
you
want
something
just
slightly
different
feel
and
drinkability
commensurate
with
that
of
water
d
not
especially
i
do
not
enjoy
skunky
beers
so
after
the
first
one
i
would
switch
to
another
the
more
i
drink
it
wasnt
to
bad
it
had
a
light
taste
to
it
d
i
can
see
how
fans
of
this
style
could
have
several
of
these
personally
im
not
a
big
fan
however
it
is
pretty
nice
for
a
grocery
store
beer
if
you
take
it
for
what
it
is
worth
this
is
a
nice
beer
it
pours
brilliant
golden
with
a
fluffy
head
and
surprising
lacing
the
aroma
is
strong
and
honeylike
the
flavor
is
bright
lemony
and
grainy
with
a
subtle
bitterness
from
the
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
pleasant
the
beer
is
best
drunk
cold
however
as
it
warms
it
develops
a
slightly
sour
cardboard
character
which
hurts
its
overall
drinkability
d
initially
was
not
expecting
much
prior
to
drinking
considering
a
macro
brew
but
came
away
surprised
would
easily
select
among
the
better
of
the
macro
brews
in
a
lager
area
that
i
have
had
d
overall
this
was
a
terrible
beer
id
drink
it
before
another
peroni
but
thats
not
saying
much
d
ok
none
of
the
flavors
are
overpowering
but
if
it
was
a
bit
fresher
tasting
it
might
be
better
this
one
is
great
the
grain
is
smouth
and
the
hops
roll
in
niceley
this
is
what
a
lager
is
suposta
taste
like
this
pours
a
nice
golden
color
with
a
big
head
that
quickley
disapers
this
is
the
pinical
of
what
green
glass
skunkey
beer
can
be
this
one
always
is
in
my
beer
rotation
try
two
or
three
you
wont
be
disapointed
mouthfeel
is
light
crisp
and
pretty
smooth
it
just
lacks
any
real
flavor
whatsoever
i
really
did
not
enjoy
this
at
all
i
dumped
half
of
it
out
in
fact
an
incredible
waste
of
money
for
what
it
costs
not
sure
why
anyone
would
buy
this
with
better
cheaper
options
available
mouthfeel
is
on
the
oily
side
but
still
fairly
thin
not
very
memorable
poured
with
a
slightly
dark
gold
appearance
no
real
lacing
head
was
a
bit
patchy
and
bubbly
slightly
sweet
aromas
of
honey
malt
and
hops
the
sweet
taste
was
maintained
throughout
the
drink
wrapped
around
a
bready
texture
mouthfeel
stabilized
its
sweetness
but
it
is
was
pretty
average
overall
a
decent
drink
fairly
light
head
good
lacing
pale
yellow
color
like
weak
tea
very
high
carbonation
and
overall
a
pleasant
and
interesting
flavor
with
a
touch
of
skunkiness
good
mouthfeel
and
drinkable
enough
overall
a
solid
beer
but
nothing
special
particularly
among
the
belgians
drinkability
is
pretty
top
notch
six
packs
of
this
can
be
polished
off
pretty
quickly
and
dont
be
surprised
to
order
more
of
this
stuff
while
eating
a
great
chicken
dinner
d
one
of
the
better
mainstream
european
lagers
out
there
the
flavour
can
get
boring
at
times
but
overall
still
pretty
good
its
the
cure
i
enjoyed
this
beer
very
refreshing
will
definitely
drink
this
again
d
ok
beer
it
has
a
little
too
much
bitterness
in
the
finish
for
me
d
good
a
descent
pale
lager
that
is
always
a
good
goto
when
other
better
beers
arent
available
pretty
smooth
and
tasty
too
alcoholic
anyway
avoid
this
swill
a
black
mark
on
the
reputation
of
a
country
that
brews
some
of
the
finest
beer
in
the
world
d
not
the
brew
for
me
but
i
will
drink
it
to
break
up
the
monotony
in
a
macro
heavy
bar
not
bad
not
great
its
ok
d
in
the
end
this
is
just
an
aboveaverage
euro
pale
lager
but
nothing
special
it
goes
down
easily
but
would
be
more
drinkable
if
it
had
more
flavor
body
and
mouthfeel
very
average
basically
fizzy
yellow
beer
the
belgians
brew
some
fine
beer
even
their
lagers
are
half
decent
this
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
nice
white
head
the
nose
is
grainy
with
some
fairly
fresh
hops
the
taste
has
light
hops
and
grainy
malts
but
no
significant
off
flavors
a
light
crisp
body
one
of
the
better
lagers
around
a
side
note
during
my
visit
to
london
and
trying
many
different
pubs
around
the
downtown
westminster
area
i
found
that
this
beer
was
served
at
about
80
of
the
pubs
perhaps
this
is
europes
anheiserbusch
my
wife
likes
this
beer
which
is
not
a
good
sign
for
many
beers
just
kidding
huney
love
ya
drinkability
not
my
first
choice
but
a
good
substitute
to
other
macrobrews
not
worth
it
for
me
another
green
bottle
disappointment
the
appearance
is
typical
of
lagers
but
leans
a
bit
towards
the
weaker
side
of
a
golden
pilsner
the
head
comes
about
huge
but
dissipates
quickly
leaving
little
to
no
lacing
the
smell
is
a
bit
funky
and
the
taste
is
quite
skunky
rhyme
unintended
mouthfeel
is
a
tad
flat
and
uninteresting
drinkability
is
just
average
i
would
equate
this
to
a
flat
heineken
without
the
kick
go
for
a
grolsch
instead
youd
be
much
more
pleased
with
the
result
thanks
belgium
much
more
flavorful
from
the
tap
than
the
bottle
but
even
from
the
bottle
it
stands
out
among
its
ilk
i
guess
this
fall
under
what
i
have
dubbed
the
bud
of
a
country
which
is
any
beer
that
is
mass
produced
and
mass
consumed
this
beer
is
the
bud
of
belgium
i
had
it
chilled
in
a
pilsener
glass
it
poured
a
bright
golden
color
with
an
ok
white
head
the
nose
was
pathetic
only
a
mild
maltiness
was
dicernable
with
my
nostrils
right
up
to
it
the
taste
was
what
i
expected
a
thin
slighty
malty
brew
with
a
fizzyness
on
the
tongue
i
guess
it
you
are
a
novice
at
beer
and
are
used
to
the
tasteless
lagers
with
this
you
can
say
you
have
had
something
foriegn
besides
heineken
drinkability
definitely
a
beer
i
could
imagine
having
again
but
also
definitely
over
hyped
some
european
guys
i
met
over
the
summer
made
this
sound
like
the
holy
grail
of
all
beers
going
on
and
on
about
how
fohkin
stella
is
the
best
fohkin
beer
there
is
i
could
definitely
see
where
they
were
coming
from
however
id
say
it
is
a
far
cry
from
the
best
fohkin
beer
out
there
notes
better
on
tap
in
my
opinion
typical
taste
and
really
nothing
to
complain
about
except
that
the
brand
is
heavily
marketed
as
some
kind
of
wonder
brewnothing
of
a
sort
d
not
bad
but
not
great
either
this
beer
is
okay
but
not
the
great
belgian
masterpiece
it
is
hyped
up
to
be
d
i
have
had
this
beer
numerous
times
and
this
is
the
first
time
i
felt
like
reviewing
it
it
was
rather
enjoyable
and
i
would
order
it
at
a
bar
with
limited
selections
d
a
nice
beer
to
pair
with
food
not
interesting
enough
to
be
consumed
by
itself
drinkability
drinkable
and
was
decent
with
a
steak
sandwich
overall
this
is
a
decent
eurolager
easy
drinking
and
quite
a
bit
tastier
than
some
other
choices
in
the
style
still
muddled
greenbottle
skunk
is
haunting
it
bottle
330
ml
golden

is
not
too
big
but
has
a
good

and

nose
is
grain
and
herbs
not
too
much
mention
here
light
body
taste
is
clean
again
grain
herbs
and
some
unexpected
sweetness
very
refreshing
ive
tried
this
one
many
times
on
tap
too
maybe
interbrew
is
doing
a
more
massmarket
beer
of
it
but
its
still
good
maybe
without
the
whole
character
it
use
to
had
years
ago
but
enjoyable
yet
pours
a
pale
yellow
with
frothy
white

medium

nothing
special
but
decent
for
the
style
avoid
if
possible
d
nothing
special
but
a
good
allaround
eurolager
that
is
very
easy
to
throw
back
and
had
a
nice
grassy
flavour
as
well
i
pity
the
person
who
drinks
this
beer
and
thinks
its
the
best
belgium
has
to
offer
nevertheless
i
definitely
see
this
beer
in
my
future
for
a
long
time
coming
drinkability
is
ok
but
i
just
dont
like
skunk
i
apologize
i
know
we
are
not
supposed
to
review
bad
beer
but
i
am
going
to
guess
that
a
majority
of
these
are
the
same
therevfore
this
is
normal
for
these
beers
and
thus
the
rating
i
tried
one
not
again
unless
i
am
closer
to
the
origin
this
beer
actually
has
hops
character
and
given
what
ive
heard
that
surprised
me
its
very
mild
but
theres
an
undeniably
grassy
and
herbal
taste
in
the
back
of
this
otherwise
clean
and
rather
plain
beer
the
malt
is
just
sweet
and
bready
and
theres
a
slight
mineral
taste
to
the
water
this
could
pass
as
an
uninspired
german
pilsner
instead
it
makes
for
a
decent
pale
lager
drinkability
average
and
a
bit
refreshing
d
had
2
mouthfuls
and
couldnt
stand
it
any
more
an
insult
to
beer
in
my
opinion
d
what
can
i
say
i
paid
8
99
for
a
sixpack
of
this
i
will
say
that
the
green
bottles
and
pretty
labels
look
great
d
it
may
be
that
his
bottle
was
skunked
it
sure
tasted
that
way
i
could
barely
finish
the
drink
but
i
did
never
again
pours
a
very
clear
pale
golden
color
with
a
thin
white
head
even
with
a
rough
pour
the
head
is
gone
in
an
instant
sweet
fruity
aroma
perhaps
apricot
taste
follows
suit
with
a
subdued
fruity
sweetness
aftertaste
is
nearly
as
nonexistent
as
the
hops
very
mild
bitterness
after
the
initial
clean
finish
as
it
warms
the
hops
come
out
a
bit
more
better
in
the
50s
it
is
what
it
is
a
macro
lager
d
inoffensive
and
easy
to
drink
most
of
us
have
had
the
old
wifebeater
at
some
point
in
our
lives
but
if
by
chance
you
havent
its
certainly
not
a
bad
macro
alternative
upon
opening
the
green
bottle
skunk
monster
was
quite
present
but
it
evacuated
as
i
poured
into
drinking
conveyance
smell
is
mild
very
mild
hops
taste
is
very
similar
to
smell
nothing
outstanding
average
at
best
bubbles
are
definitely
present
on
taste
palate
which
sort
of
messes
with
finish
otherwise
a
decent
beer
and
a
good
choice
if
nothing
else
is
available
d
not
as
bad
as
alot
of
people
say
i
even
like
drinking
them
with
a
heavy
meal
and
sometimes
i
find
myself
really
craving
one
but
not
something
id
enjoy
everyday
d
if
i
were
hot
and
really
thirsty
i
might
have
finished
that
6
pack
i
have
been
drinking
a
case
of
this
during
the
week
and
i
am
not
impressed
looks
sort
of
bright
yellowsmell
light
hops
taste
not
bad
but
not
what
i
thought
from
what
i
was
told
it
would
be
like
small
head
it
is
not
much
for
refreshment
in
your
mouth
you
can
drink
a
couple
easy
enough
but
do
you
want
to
for
me
two
is
the
max
and
one
is
better
definately
drinkable
i
could
have
had
a
few
more
drinkability
was
good
which
is
no
surprise
for
such
a
mild
brew
maybe
its
me
but
im
just
not
that
big
of
a
fan
this
beer
didnt
do
anything
wrong
it
just
didnt
really
do
anything
it
was
the
best
selection
they
had
on
the
menu
to
choose
from
and
in
that
case
it
was
very
drinkable
and
i
would
order
it
again
if
that
was
the
best
choice
but
if
something
else
was
available
i
would
order
that
i
would
consider
this
a
fairly
good
euro
pale
lager
decent
flavors
but
could
use
some
work
on
the
auroma
d
pretty
darn
refreshing
on
a
hot
summer
day
but
i
can
think
of
1500
beers
id
look
to
first
before
id
ever
think
of
considering
stella
tastemouthfeel
semisweet
pale
malts
make
up
the
bulk
of
the
flavor
a
bit
grassy
toward
the
middle
with
a
slight
husky
bitterness
in
the
finish
along
with
the
faintest
trace
of
hops
overcarbonated
somewhat
bloating
despite
the
very
light
body
not
as
clean
as
i
would
expect
from
a
macro
lager
but
there
are
no
major
flaws
either
mediocre
stuff
but
drinkable
d
drinkability
is
good
it
really
is
a
lighter
beer
that
goes
down
fairly
easy
ill
probably
end
up
getting
it
again
overall
not
a
big
beer
but
its
not
trying
to
be
this
is
a
step
above
a
heineken
or
becks
but
a
step
below
say
a
pilsner
urquell
for
what
its
worth
i
sort
of
enjoy
this
beer
now
and
then
i
was
hoping
from
more
from
this
belgian
beer
it
is
better
than
bud
but
not
by
much
it
is
a
bit
stronger
but
actually
may
be
somewhat
more
bitter
not
a
good
trait
in
my
mind
very
easy
to
drink
and
enjoy
all
night
not
a
bad
export
lager
better
then
a
lot
of
the
usual
suspects
available
everywhere
so
its
better
than
most
of
the
ususal
suspects
easy
to
drink
a
few
at
a
sitting
i
usually
like
a
lot
of
flavor
in
my
beer
but
this
was
quite
the
exception
poured
12
ounce
green
bottle
into
a
16
oz
pilsner
glass
moderate
head
some
lacing
light
hoppy
aroma
with
a
hint
of
skunkiness
feels
light
and
thin
in
the
mouth
very
crisp
in
taste
with
nice
balance
a
very
drinkable
beer
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
despite
the
paleness
of
flavors
and
virtually
invisible
malts
the
body
carries
a
small
amount
of
weight
and
an
uppity
but
non
obnoxious
carbonation
level
its
a
great
basic
washer
or
quencher
but
there
is
simply
not
enough
flavor
here
to
recommend
it
even
against
many
of
its
euro
lager
peers
especially
with
the
premium
image
and
price
point
it
assumes
one
of
my
fav
beers
i
found
this
one
to
be
a
tad
better
on
tap
than
in
the
bottle
drinkability
average
drinkable
beer
good
guzzler
i
was
a
bit
dissapointed
with
this
beer
given
its
sterling
reputation
it
looked
like
an
ordinary
pale
lager
with
a
good
deal
of
carbonation
the
hop
flavors
were
somewhat
complex
but
also
noisy
confused
and
not
unified
it
was
okay
but
not
great
next
time
ill
order
something
different
dquite
drinkable
its
pretty
light
and
tasty
not
entirely
my
style
but
its
fairly
easy
to
find
so
when
there
is
a
somwhat
limited
selection
this
would
be
a
pretty
decent
choice
the
body
of
this
one
a
tad
more
than
light
but
definitely
not
medium
i
found
it
mostly
average
but
it
has
its
limited
charm
good
amount
of
carbonation
very
light
and
easy
to
drink
not
a
style
i
drink
often
at
least
not
anymore
but
this
one
is
a
decent
one
the
taste
is
bland
the
only
thing
that
sets
this
one
apart
is
a
slight
pepper
like
taste
on
finish
carbonation
is
active
and
lends
a
crisp
clean
finish
very
easy
drinking
but
if
i
am
paying
import
prices
i
am
getting
something
a
little
more
exciting
drinkability
this
particular
bottle
was
quite
nice
and
i
would
enjoy
it
often
if
they
all
were
like
this
i
have
had
my
fair
share
of
terrible
stellas
as
well
the
key
i
think
it
to
get
12
packs
that
arent
going
to
be
exposed
to
light
in
storage
the
way
that
6
packs
would
rating
on
this
bottle
drinkability
is
great
not
my
favorite
style
but
all
in
all
a
nice
macroeurolager
on
draft
this
beer
takes
a
different
personaility
it
isnt
skunky
for
starters
and
the
bitterness
melds
into
the
overall
flavor
better
but
still
pretty
dull
the
chilled
glass
and
colder
beer
temperature
might
have
helped
after
all
the
marketers
of
stella
artois
insist
on
serving
it
at
3
degrees
celcius
after
drinking
a
bunch
of
ales
recently
i
found
a
mellow
beer
chill
out
on
courtesy
of
the
bar
near
my
school
d
i
thoroughly
enjoy
stella
and
sometimes
purchase
a
case
of
this
beer
on
occasion
i
figured
i
would
write
about
it
this
time
this
was
served
at
about
40f
5c
which
causes
this
well
carbonated
beer
to
have
a
peppery
carbonic
acid
bite
to
it
up
front
crisp
and
clean
up
front
with
a
biting
bitterness
that
easily
cuts
through
the
light
malt
character
here
the
hop
bitterness
picks
up
a
bit
of
herbal
hop
character
to
it
as
it
moves
towards
the
finish
the
malt
character
starts
out
pretty
dry
and
really
nonexistent
but
picks
up
a
soft
grainlike
sweetness
and
a
touch
of
crackerlike
malt
by
the
time
one
gets
to
the
finish
this
is
very
clean
and
at
this
temperature
has
not
off
flavors
quite
crisp
and
refreshing
actually
but
ill
admit
that
when
i
am
in
need
of
crisp
and
refreshing
i
usually
opt
for
water
this
is
certainly
not
a
bad
beer
if
they
had
only
used
a
quirky
belgian
yeast
this
might
actually
be
quite
tasty
could
drink
a
couple
of
these
too
much
of
a
boring
pale
taste
to
want
to
drink
more
than
one
much
better
offerings
of
this
type
of
beer
can
be
found
anywhere
dont
know
why
this
beer
is
popular
light
golden
pour
with
white
head
light
taste
overall
and
high
carbonation
some
honey
sweet
malt
smell
similar
taste
with
a
light
quick
bitterness
and
aftertaste
simple
and
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
nothing
to
go
wild
over
but
for
the
style
perhaps
one
of
the
better
lagers
d
like
sipping
water
in
the
taste
and
not
at
all
enjoyable
ive
always
wished
id
liked
this
one
because
some
really
think
its
decent
but
just
not
happening
drinkability
is
average
because
while
its
easy
to
drink
one
it
kinda
blurs
together
after
that
first
one
and
you
dont
really
get
flavors
and
it
has
quite
a
kick
from
the
deceptively
low
abv
this
is
a
fairly
drinkable
beer
thats
been
picked
up
by
quite
a
few
bars
not
a
good
sign
people
seem
to
think
because
it
has
a
a
foreign
name
its
good
its
averageness
is
a
hard
thing
to
overcome
had
this
in
a
bottle
at
bone
fish
grill
on
route
46
in
jersey
good
pale
lager
taste
decent
appearance
with
typcial
lager
smell
taste
was
pleasant
went
down
smooth
and
easily
and
complimented
my
fish
dish
very
well
an
easily
drinkable
good
mouthfeel
enjoyable
social
brew
wouldnt
definitely
try
this
again
if
it
was
offered
at
a
restaurant
or
pub
a
european
staple
and
popular
brew
for
many
obvious
reasons
i
liked
this
brew
although
it
wasnt
anything
aboveandbeyond
i
really
think
stella
is
quite
crappy
and
thus
would
not
drink
it
again
however
there
is
a
following
among
yuppies
who
see
the
tap
like
holding
the
glass
and
consider
it
a
trendier
beverage
than
bud
light
its
lesser
priced
american
twin
this
is
the
budweiser
of
belgium
albeit
a
better
quality
beer
than
a
bud
a
pretty
standard
eurolager
refreshing
and
unoffensive
it
bothers
me
a
bit
when
someone
says
they
like
belgian
beer
and
are
talking
about
stella
decent
beer
remined
me
of
pilsner
urquell
but
maybe
its
just
the
green
bottle
and
pale
color
i
expected
a
skunky
flavor
because
of
the
bottle
but
was
pleasantly
surprised
no
skunkiness
at
all
mild
in
flavor
with
a
slight
bitterness
high
level
of
carbonation
and
poured
an
almost
2
head
overall
a
good
light
drinkable
brew
that
would
be
refreshing
on
a
hot
summer
day
d
while
its
really
nothing
special
i
will
say
that
its
better
than
a
macro
this
was
really
not
a
good
beer
for
me
poured
a
decent
straw
color
with
some
good
head
and
lacing
weak
malty
scent
with
a
slightly
sourskunk
tint
same
for
the
taste
fairly
weak
mostly
sour
went
down
all
right
but
beyond
the
sixer
i
have
ill
never
get
it
again
this
review
is
for
the
bottle
version
which
is
not
as
good
as
the
tap
version
still
stella
is
my
favorite
of
the
widely
distributed
macro
brews
im
not
sure
how
anyone
could
think
this
beer
tastes
the
same
as
becks
or
how
anyone
could
give
it
a
drinkability
score
of
2
or
lower
simply
put
its
a
simple
beer
and
if
there
arent
any
good
or
unusual
beers
available
at
a
restaurant
ill
pay
for
one
on
tap
or
for
home
drinking
ill
pay
for
a
12
of
these
at
12
or
13
if
theyre
on
sale
one
could
do
much
worse
i
first
had
this
while
doing
research
in
detroit
and
it
was
a
nice
lunch
accompaniment
this
poured
a
fine
light
golden
body
with
a
finger
of
white
froth
not
much
for
the
nose
thoughmalt
certainly
but
little
else
the
taste
was
nice
crisp
clean
and
with
good
hopped
flavor
yet
the
carbonation
was
far
too
heavy
like
bold
ginger
ale
and
i
just
dont
like
to
burp
that
much
that
fast
all
in
all
not
badnot
a
typical
belgian
style
by
a
long
shotmore
like
a
decent
german
lager
masquerading
as
a
belgian
give
it
a
shot
this
beer
poured
a
light
gold
with
a
fair
amount
of
foam
that
quickly
dissipated
it
smells
a
bit
sweet
and
the
flavor
likewise
theres
a
bit
of
grassy
hops
flavor
but
not
too
much
its
basically
a
watered
down
pils
that
is
supposed
to
be
sexy
because
its
an
import
id
skip
stella
next
time
and
go
with
an
actual
beer
if
you
like
a
good
lager
this
looks
and
tastes
exactly
like
a
good
lager
should
it
has
the
distinct
golden
aura
and
smooth
taste
of
many
european
lagers
but
with
that
added
bit
of
distinction
that
it
has
been
brewed
for
over
600
years
this
is
by
far
my
favorite
beer
to
drink
any
time
with
any
fare
if
you
have
never
tried
this
beer
do
so
in
the
scores
you
will
see
a
wide
deviation
of
scores
and
reviews
unexpectedly
polarized
its
also
worth
noting
that
euro
pale
lagers
in
general
score
very
low
among
ba
reviews
sort
this
style
by
score
and
try
to
find
just
two
euro
pales
scoring
over
4
00
points
see
what
i
mean
stella
is
heavily
advertised
hyped
and
notunexpectedly
it
suffers
from
a
possible
backlash
i
love
this
beer
it
reminds
me
of
peroni
in
many
ways
this
would
be
a
great
beer
to
eat
with
italian
food
this
is
an
old
stand
by
beer
if
there
is
nothing
else
to
drink
i
would
highly
recommend
this
beer
but
not
to
timid
beer
drinkersi
had
about
3
of
these
beers
and
have
heard
that
budwieser
bought
out
this
beer
in
oklahoma
and
may
not
carry
it
anymore
hope
that
is
not
true
drinkability
not
a
bad
european
lager
i
am
amazed
at
how
quickly
this
brand
has
grown
in
the
u
s
market
during
the
last
few
years
when
you
buy
this
beer
youre
paying
for
the
hype
if
you
want
something
clean
and
clear
that
tastes
like
beer
dont
pay
more
than
you
have
to
i
must
note
one
thing
when
i
worked
at
a
liquor
store
in
florida
this
was
an
immensley
popular
beer
w
the
expensive
beer
crowd
that
means
the
people
who
didnt
buy
busch
or
bud
this
is
a
watered
down
version
of
a
good
belgian
so
if
you
are
into
belgians
alot
youll
probably
be
better
served
spending
the
extra
buck
or
two
and
buying
the
real
deals

i
was
inspired
by
a
recent
forum
to
try
this
beer
pours
a
clear
light
golden
straw
color
w
a
fluffy
white
head
which
dissapates
quickly
good
lacing
a
vinous

smell
with
a
slight

crisp
good
hop
bite
at
first
then
it
just
fizzles
away
to
nothingness
almost
watery
a
very
faint
alcohol
undertone
not
as
bad
as
i
thought
itd
be
but
nothing
spectacular
a
dry
light
bodied
beer
w
good
carbonation
i
consider
this
a
very
drinkable
beer
if
it
was
cheap
id
replace
my
labatt
ice
w
it
this
is
a
very
unexceptional
beer
tastes
like
an
american
macrobrew
by
unexceptional
i
dont
mean
bad
but
it
is
has
nothing
to
distinguish
it
from
the
rest
of
the
pack
golden
color
with
coarse
carbonation
smells
kind
of
like
heineken
in
fact
i
doubt
many
people
could
tell
the
difference
in
a
blind
taste
test
feels
thin
in
the
mouth
with
a
slightly
sour
aftertaste
average
drinkability
uggh
i
should
have
ordered
a
glass
of
water
instead
but
this
is
belgian
beer
for
the
masses
i
got
this
ontap
at
the
restaurant
at
work
no
head
when
i
got
it
faint
aromas
like
an
american
pils
taste
was
watery
not
predominate
beer
flavors
in
my
face
to
speak
of
i
have
to
give
the
beer
credit
though
for
its
easy
drinkability
its
gone
before
you
know
it
maybe
due
to
the
lack
of
taste
anyway
ill
drink
as
long
as
there
giving
it
to
me
nothing
too
impressive
about
this
brew
from
what
ive
read
seen
and
heard
it
seems
like
this
brew
is
considered
great
by
people
who
usually
enjoy
macros
which
is
fine
i
think
this
is
a
definite
step
up
from
a
macro
but
still
nothing
too
impressive
it
has
its
mild
hop
tastes
and
malts
but
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
great
beer
to
kick
back
and
relax
with
and
definitely
easier
to
find
than
a
lot
of
other
beers
but
nothing
id
order
at
a
bar
if
there
were
other
micros
around
overall
if
youre
at
a
beer
bar
or
store
that
only
carries
macros
this
is
the
way
to
go
but
if
you
see
a
good
selection
of
other
brews
this
probably
isnt
the
best
of
the
bunch
this
is
not
worth
your
time
or
money
stella
is
a
beer
for
those
trying
to
look
sophisticated
and
cultured
to
people
who
dont
know
any
better
i
never
thought
id
say
this
but
save
your
money
and
just
get
a
budweiser
a
unwanted
dry
aftertaste
which
knocks
my
drinkability
score
too
this
is
a
great
beer
to
order
at
a
bar
basically
you
can
find
this
anywhere
now
its
lite
sweet
and
good
a
staple
safety
beer
when
there
isnt
much
of
a
selection
overall
its
just
about
the
only
massproduced
pale
lager
i
can
actually
stand
to
drink
very
easy
to
drink
goes
well
with
certain
cuisines
and
is
a
good
snack
beer
because
it
isnt
filling
and
takes
absolutely
no
thought
for
the
price
ill
take
a
pack
of
great
lakes
and
keep
the
dollar
any
day
but
if
pale
lagers
are
your
thing
this
one
isnt
all
bad
of
a
choice
edit
recent
tastings
have
convinced
me
that
australian
brewed
stella
is
actually
pretty
crap
its
about
damn
time
i
reduced
the
score
on
this
and
a
rereview
would
probably
result
in
an
even
lower
score
this
was
a
much
better
experience
its
still
a
little
overhyped
but
had
a
better
experience
with
the
bottle
look
for
what
it
is
in
my
opinion
this
is
a
very
good
beer
a
crisp
drinkable
light
refreshing
beer
pours
a
bright
and
clear
light
golden
yellow
color
and
displays
a
huge
fluffy
white
head
that
just
wont
go
away
this
beer
demonstrates
active
carbonation
bubbles
and
spotty
lacing
inside
the
pint
glass
the
nose
is
virtually
nonexistent
as
is
characteristic
of
most
light
lagers
but
some
malt
sweetness
can
be
detected
and
there
is
no
telltale
skunkiness
or
other
off
notes
here
doesnt
smell
bad
it
just
doesnt
smell
like
much
of
anything
at
all
the
palate
is
much
the
same
very
unchallenging
of
course
but
this
beer
is
designed
to
be
drinkable
right
slightly
sweet
malt
flavors
are
predominant
and
there
is
just
enough
hop
backbone
to
keep
it
in
balance
finish
is
clean
and
dry
with
light
acidity
beer
snobs
love
to
slam
this
beer
right
along
with
the
typical
americanmade
light
lagers
but
i
dont
know
that
this
is
fair
while
this
beer
is
high
on
drinkability
and
quite
plain
in
almost
every
respect
it
doesnt
contain
any
of
the
offflavors
that
characterize
so
many
of
the
domestic
macros
i
can
enjoy
this
beer
with
an
appropriate
meal
and
ill
select
it
over
almost
any
domestic
light
lager
if
given
the
chance
im
not
saying
this
beer
is
great
but
i
am
saying
it
is
better
and
slightly
more
flavorful
than
its
american
contemporaries
the
body
is
light
but
understandable
for
style
a
clean
taste
but
not
as
crisp
for
style
either
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
to
say
in
the
least
pours
a
clear
pale
golden
color
with
a
fizzy
short
lived
head
no
lacing
aroma
is
simple
a
little
grassy
taste
is
rather
lacking
nothing
special
a
little
hop
bitternes
is
noticed
late
in
the
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
thin
light
and
almost
watery
not
what
i
expected
dont
let
the
belgian
name
on
the
bottle
fool
you
this
is
nothing
to
go
out
of
your
way
to
get
on
tap
it
is
a
little
better
but
still
just
like
any
macrobrewed
lager
around
the
real
pisser
was
that
i
just
forked
over
9
49
for
a
6pack
tonight
i
guess
despite
the
lack
of
mouthfeel
or
taste
it
is
pretty
drinkable
but
there
are
other
beers
i
would
definitely
reach
for
before
this
stella
artois
taste
has
a
hint
of
malt
and
some
sort
of
weird
spice
aftertaste
completely
foul
overall
this
is
an
average
to
slightly
above
average
effort
i
would
drink
again
but
not
go
out
of
my
way
to
purchase
medium
pale
color
with
a
minimal
amount
of
head
hey
its
another
lager
im
kind
of
really
into
lagers
now
anyway
the
aroma
is
light
and
crisp
with
a
mild
sweetness
taste
is
very
sweet
and
somewhat
bitter
at
the
same
time
could
that
be
the
hops
possibly
saaz
regardless
the
taste
is
kind
of
heavy
and
strong
not
what
i
was
expecting
still
a
decent
middleoftheroad
choice
could
drink
a
whole
lot
of
these
stella
is
a
good
beer
and
better
than
its
regional
cousin
grolsch
grolsch
must
have
changed
their
recipe
in
the
past
20
years
its
macrobitter
now
stella
has
malt
though
it
is
somewhat
dry
some
type
of
continental
hops
are
here
considering
the
price
and
small
bottles
ill
opt
for
other
beers
poured
from
a
green
bottle
into
a
stella
gobletgot
the
usual
mild
skunk
aroma
right
off
the
bat
nice
clear
golden
yellow
color
with
good
size
white
head
that
didnt
linger
to
long
with
absolutely
no
lacingskunk
smell
dissipated
rather
quickly
and
left
a
cleanfresh
grain
aroma
this
beer
goes
down
quite
nicelyrefreshing
crisp
and
tangy
with
a
little
bitterness
bite
to
it
with
a
little
heaviness
to
it
and
carbonation
that
leaves
a
dryness
behind
well
worth
a
try
pale
golden
brew
with
a
decent
white
head
and
some
average
lacing
the
aroma
is
all
wheatgrassbread
kind
of
dry
but
the
first
taste
comes
out
somewhat
creamy
for
a
lager
still
bready
with
a
somewhat
tart
yeasty
quality
a
dry
finish
ive
always
liked
stella
on
tap
it
seems
a
bit
less
impressive
by
the
bottle
more
ordinary
and
less
crisp
as
one
might
expect
i
dont
pick
up
so
much
citrus
as
i
recall
from
the
tap
there
is
a
little
sweet
malt
here
but
its
well
overrun
by
the
yeast
and
bread
flavors
in
the
bottle
easy
enough
to
drink
but
it
grows
a
bit
worn
out
after
a
few
although
not
overly
complicated
i
find
this
euro
lager
has
substantial
attitude
but
is
perhaps
a
little
overbearing
if
you
plan
to
drink
several
in
the
same
sitting
i
think
just
one
of
these
would
take
care
of
my
needs
id
enjoy
it
but
likely
move
on
to
something
else
if
available
stella
is
the
typical
premium
beer
restaurants
have
on
tap
it
is
a
sessionable
beer
i
could
easily
down
a
few
of
these
but
nothing
really
stands
out
about
the
beer
the
hops
are
there
and
there
are
more
than
a
typical
beer
and
the
flavor
is
ok
but
for
the
price
89
there
are
plenty
of
other
good
beers
pours
a
light
yellow
color
with
minimal
white
head
smell
is
not
very
strong
and
i
can
kinda
smell
some
malt
and
mostly
grain
the
taste
is
bittering
and
gives
way
to
again
more
of
the
grainy
taste
it
leaves
a
tiny
bit
of
sweetness
that
might
be
the
reason
people
keep
drinking
these
the
carbonation
is
crisp
and
made
a
nice
compliment
with
the
spicy
dish
a
light
golden
color
with
a
thin
fizzy
head
smell
is
of
light
hops
somewhat
skunky
also
taste
is
light
hops
and
honeylike
malts
very
light
and
slightly
bitter
decent
drinkability
though
this
isnt
a
regular
id
rather
have
it
ontap
but
cant
complain
about
the
bottle
wasnt
to
much
to
say
about
this
it
kind
of
reminded
me
of
warsteiner
only
snappier
does
not
remind
me
at
all
of
belgian
style
beers
it
was
near
95
that
day
the
grill
was
going
and
i
enjoyed
the
few
i
had
if
i
had
no
other
options
besides
bmc
i
would
pick
this
up
in
a
heartbeat
run
of
the
mill
lager
tasty
but
not
up
to
its
hype
after
its
appearance
its
all
slightly
downhill
on
tap
and
poured
into
a
shaker
this
pale
lager
poured
the
typical
clear
golden
color
with
a
huge
amount
of
dancing
carbonation
bubbles
dancing
up
the
sides
of
the
glass
a
very
thin
white
fizzy
head
quickly
faded
away
the
aroma
of
this
beer
was
sweet
malts
and
some
surprisingly
strong
for
a
pale
lager
hop
notes
the
flavor
was
much
the
same
sweet
maltiness
followed
by
a
nice
noble
hop
presence
one
of
the
better
pale
lagers
that
i
have
sampled
always
anticipating
but
always
disappointed
looks
refreshing
but
the
flavor
is
just
plain
mediocre
in
my
humble
opinion
and
i
try
everything
it
has
a
slight
acidity
in
the
back
of
the
throat
when
it
goes
down
i
give
it
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
time
after
time
but
mr
stomach
tells
me
to
avoid
it
altogether
now
my
brother
likes
this
golden
lager
but
i
always
get
a
sour
gut
from
it
i
cannot
recommend
a
beer
that
consistently
makes
me
sick
after
one
bottle
overhyped
and
fairly
average
lager
overall
crisp
and
refreshing
but
very
common
the
lager
style
is
definitely
not
a
specialty
in
belgium
this
isnt
a
very
a
very
good
tasting
euro
pale
lager
and
its
a
bit
heavy
so
i
dont
feel
its
drinkable
at
all
the
best
part
is
the
glass
which
along
with
belgiums
well
deserved
reputation
for
brewing
the
best
beers
are
probably
the
only
reason
its
popular
this
tasting
changed
my
impression
of
the
stella
atois
significantly
d
very
impressive
for
a
mass
marketed
beer
im
seeing
this
more
and
more
at
the
lesser
bars
and
restaurants
that
dont
quite
carry
a
decent
selection
of
imports
i
would
choose
this
lager
over
most
of
the
more
common
selections
drinkability
par
for
the
course
for
a
euro
pale
lager
there
is
one
thing
i
did
think
that
did
stand
out
about
this
one
and
that
was
the
apperance
a
nice
gold
color
besides
that
everything
else
was
pretty
much
average
the
taste
was
smooth
something
you
would
drink
after
a
hard
day
the
smell
hardly
any
to
speak
of
was
very
faint
it
is
worth
a
try
but
i
would
try
a
6
before
a
12
drinkability
why
bother
its
empty
calories
highly
drinkable
for
the
summer
but
not
the
fall
and
winter
this
is
possibly
the
most
boring
belgian
beer
you
can
buy
but
its
really
not
bad
quality
seems
quite
high
although
my
bottle
seems
a
bit
on
the
skunked
side
so
i
have
tried
to
account
for
that
in
my
score
this
is
the
best
beer
available
ontap
at
many
venues
in
australia
so
i
will
probably
be
drinking
it
again
but
there
are
a
lot
better
session
beer
choices
out
there
partial
to
stella
in
times
of
mass
drinking
i
figured
it
deserved
a
rating
lively
malt
crispiness
greets
the
nostrils
as
a
soft
golden
effervesecent
lacing
that
forms
strong
corallike
branches
smooth
crisp
and
nondescript
taste
accompanied
by
lagerish
palete
with
some
bubbliness
to
me
a
macro
with
at
least
a
clue
of
how
to
present
itself
the
aroma
is
mild
and
malty
and
not
too
strong
it
pours
a
nice
golden
colour
with
a
fair
sized
white
head
and
looks
like
a
beer
should
it
is
very
smooth
to
the
tongue
and
goes
down
nicely
it
has
a
mild
taste
that
makes
this
a
very
easy
beer
to
drink
drinkability
easy
drinking
beer
pale
lagers
are
not
my
style
but
ill
take
this
over
the
bigger
name
pale
lagers
and
all
macros
12oz
green
bottle
pours
golden
with
a
sudsy
head
big
bubbles
race
to
the
top
of
the
beer
this
brew
shows
good
clarity
has
that
sharp
green
bottle
beer
smell
kinda
like
newly
mown
hay
mixed
with
salty
sea
air
spicey
malt
and
salty
hops
my
samples
are
fresh
from
a
12pack
box
and
are
not
oxidised
tastes
basically
like
most
eurolagers
except
has
a
pronounced
salty
bittering
hop
character
my
guess
is
saaz
hops
not
bad
but
also
not
that
interesting
to
me
i
know
lots
of
people
go
crazy
for
this
beer
and
im
always
up
to
sharing
a
round
but
i
favor
other
styles
a
good
beer
to
keep
handy
though
because
of
guests
who
might
cringe
over
all
the
ales
i
have
aroundwho
keeps
inviting
these
people
drinkabilitiy
easy
to
drink
has
that
less
filling
feel
d
seems
like
a
beer
that
would
go
over
well
with
a
heavydrinking
crowd
thats
gotten
tired
of
other
european
macros
or
bmc
and
want
to
step
it
up
oddly
enough
it
feels
like
this
beer
is
a
step
above
in
that
regard
but
certainly
remains
toward
the
bottom
part
of
the
ladder
in
the
grand
scheme
of
things
nice
clean
refreshing
lager
light
mouthfeel
and
crisp
very
clean
finish
make
this
a
perfect
summer
beer
nicely
hopped
without
a
lot
of
heavy
malt
not
very
bitter
serve
ice
cold
and
drink
before
it
warms
up
a
good
replacement
for
your
the
unwashed
horde
that
drinks
bud
da
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
euro
lagers
drinkability
a
very
drinkable
beer
not
overlly
filling
and
with
enough
flavor
to
be
interesting
i
think
there
is
a
time
and
a
place
for
stella
i
find
that
it
is
easier
to
get
at
most
places
then
other
craft
beers
that
i
might
like
more
and
its
a
good
thirst
quencher
good
clean
eurolager
better
on
tap
with
the
fancydancy
gold
rimed
stella
glass
i
think
its
overrated
and
overpriced
to
grab
a
sixpack
i
find
it
priced
over
8
for
a
sixer
out
here
and
it
kills
me
to
see
people
buying
them
over
the
rainbow
of
flavors
were
so
lucky
to
have
here
in
oregon
but
whatever
still
not
a
bad
beer
better
than
the
macro
lagers
here
in
the
states
at
least
theres
a
nice
hop
flavor
here
this
is
very
light
straw
colored
in
the
glass
and
clear
enough
that
i
could
watch
tv
through
it
were
it
not
for
the
contour
of
the
glass
a
snow
white
head
that
was
creamy
with
decent
lacing
suggesting
that
it
was
not
forcecarbonated
like
most
macros
hay
vegetal
and
musty
belgian
notes
in
the
nose
taste
is
a
mixture
of
light
malt
sweetness
and
light
hops
in
the
background
mouthfeel
is
light
in
body
but
without
the
fake
feeling
carbonation
in
the
mouth
of
most
macros
light
light
light
i
can
see
why
this
beer
is
so
ubiquitous
it
does
have
more
going
on
than
mast
macro
lagers
however
and
i
detected
no
adjuncts
drinkability
is
fine
but
not
enough
going
on
to
make
you
want
to
keep
drinking
maybe
a
good
thirst
quencher
on
a
hot
day
this
beer
pours
a
nice
clear
golden
color
and
has
a
nice
long
lasting
head
with
good
lacing
unfortunately
it
is
very
skunky
probably
because
of
the
green
bottle
letting
uv
rays
in
it
tastes
slightly
skunky
but
is
crisp
and
clean
tastes
crisp
and
bitter
kind
of
like
a
cross
between
czechvar
and
heineken
average
pils
better
than
an
american
pils
since
it
does
have
flavor
but
not
overly
impressive
this
beer
seems
to
be
getting
smacked
around
a
bit
but
it
is
a
much
better
than
average
lager
it
is
light
in
flavor
and
color
and
mouthfeel
when
compared
to
most
belgium
beers
but
when
compared
to
beers
like
it
from
the
u
s
especially
macros
i
find
it
to
be
one
of
my
favorite
beers
when
it
comes
to
refreshing
light
and
satisfying
beers
on
a
warm
spring
or
summer
day
solid
head
for
the
style
and
some
lacing
the
flavor
is
slightly
sweet
that
goes
well
with
grilled
fish
or
chicken
the
aroma
is
light
with
a
hint
of
hops
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
i
had
four
last
night
while
grilling
out
and
listening
to
got
the
green
grass
by
ian
moore
and
watching
my
kids
swim
i
tell
ya
it
doesnt
get
any
better
than
that
one
of
the
most
popular
belgians
out
there
but
i
guess
for
the
masses
it
is
a
good
bridge
to
get
you
there
looking
a
standard
pilsner
very
clarified
and
clean
a
nice
bite
and
ends
just
like
a
standard
pils
it
is
a
little
sweeter
than
pils
from
germany
and
the
czech
republic
pours
out
a
pale
gold
with
a
thick
full
head
that
leaves
tightly
wound
lacing
on
the
glass
in
the
nose
i
get
a
mix
of
pale
grain
spicy
hops
and
a
touch
of
booze
flavor
is
about
the
same
as
in
the
nose
but
without
the
alcohol
character
malts
come
out
in
full
and
end
kind
of
sweet
the
hops
make
a
decent
showing
giving
some
tea
and
floral
flavors
mouthfeel
is
a
little
slick
and
needs
a
little
oomph
in
the
carbonation
overall
a
decent
drinker
and
i
dont
know
why
people
want
to
knock
this
nothing
offensive
and
certainly
steps
above
corn
and
riceladen
macros
its
a
pale
euro
lager
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
almost
always
there
not
really
better
or
worse
than
others
but
certainly
not
offensive
mouthfeeldrinkability
light
bodied
pretty
well
carbonated
and
goes
down
easy
enough
not
a
terrible
beer
for
a
hot
day
if
i
liked
it
better
id
call
it
a
session
but
i
dont
think
id
want
more
than
two
overall
its
an
okay
beer
i
certainly
prefer
it
over
an
american
macro
the
exp
date
didnt
effect
the
beer
any
i
think
if
it
did
it
was
very
slightly
alter
does
a
beer
made
since
1366
need
to
have
a
born
on
date
pours
very
yellow
and
clear
with
a
small
head
that
fades
to
just
a
collar
very
quickly
little
in
the
way
of
active
carbonation
the
nose
betrays
some
salty
slightly
rubbery
hops
and
a
light
toast
as
in
heated
bread
malt
note
its
a
decent
aroma
as
macros
go
on
the
palate
initial
sweetness
gives
way
to
a
cardboardish
bitterness
thats
a
bit
unpleasant
no
depth
to
the
malt
very
bland
at
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
full
of
carbonation
and
light
in
body
with
no
distinguishing
features
overall
this
is
not
very
good
the
aroma
is
pretty
promising
but
it
falls
apart
on
the
palate
with
lowquality
malt
and
hop
flavors
that
dont
stand
out
in
any
way
nor
do
they
please
the
tongue
gotta
love
marketing
this
isnt
quite
as
bad
as
the
snobs
would
have
you
believe
but
still
i
wouldnt
drink
it
unless
it
came
to
me
unsolicited
which
this
one
did
time
for
a
scaldis
what
can
you
say
about
a
stella
that
the
last
500
people
havent
it
is
pale
doesnt
have
much
of
a
head
has
lots
of
good
carbonation
this
is
a
typical
euro
lager
but
with
a
sharpness
that
compromises
its
quality
slight
hoppy
flavor
cooked
vegetables
a
dry
beer
not
all
that
interesting
but
not
bad
either
it
is
a
shame
this
comes
out
of
belgium
a
country
with
the
finest
beers
available
and
stella
and
maes
being
the
two
worst
representatives
from
the
country
hands
down
pick
for
my
favorite
everyday
beer
its
got
that
light
almost
nonexistent
hops
smell
light
carbonation
and
blond
color
that
says
beer
it
wont
change
your
life
but
it
has
just
a
little
more
than
your
average
pale
lager
bitter
but
with
some
fruit
if
i
see
another
i
think
i
will
pick
it
upbut
not
going
to
go
out
of
my
way
to
pick
some
up
drinkability
i
am
sure
this
beer
was
much
better
in
the
past
but
as
it
stands
right
now
it
is
a
slight
step
over
the
heinekins
becks
buds
etcs
of
the
world
i
could
probably
drink
3
or
4
of
these
on
a
hot
summer
day
but
thats
about
it
the
price
is
slightly
outrageous
if
i
were
to
actually
purchase
this
beer
in
a
12
pack
its
almost
15
dollars
which
to
me
is
crazy
i
do
not
see
myself
visiting
this
beer
again
after
my
free
12
pack
is
history
o
a
good
session
beer
not
challenging
nor
terribly
interesting
but
very
reliable
and
very
drinkable
plus
the
wrapping
around
the
bottle
cap
makes
it
seem
fancy
a
decent
beer
golden
and
transparent
with
a
moderate
head
aroma
is
decidedly
beery
taste
is
malty
no
bitterness
no
complexity
not
spectacular
but
smooth
and
drinkable
a
nice
accompaniment
for
dinner
lively
conversation
or
a
sports
event
on
tv
this
is
a
good
party
drink
without
regret
pours
a
pale
yellow
what
i
would
expect
from
a
lager
smells
like
skunk
and
hemp
taste
is
refreshing
light
dry
and
maybe
a
little
citrus
lots
of
carbonation
this
is
a
mass
produced
eauro
lager
that
i
suppose
one
could
drink
all
night
with
the
intention
of
becoming
totally
inebriated
but
trying
to
look
more
sophisticated
than
a
guy
doing
the
same
thing
with
a
bud
light
a
friend
of
mine
kept
raving
about
how
great
this
beer
was
so
naturally
i
wanted
to
try
it
he
was
nice
enough
to
actually
buy
me
one
and
bring
it
over
for
me
to
try
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
poured
a
clear
straw
forming
a
thin
14
inch
head
that
left
light
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
almost
all
skunky
with
a
hint
of
hop
sweetness
i
expected
it
to
taste
as
bad
as
it
smelled
but
was
suprised
to
find
that
it
wasnt
that
bad
very
smooth
clean
hop
flavor
with
a
good
balance
of
malt
thickness
light
mouthfeel
aside
from
the
smell
i
could
see
having
one
or
two
of
these
in
a
session
not
as
bad
as
i
thought
it
would
be
it
reminds
me
of
st
pauli
girl
once
you
get
past
the
smell
its
not
a
bad
beer
take
a
chance
and
give
it
a
shot
d
really
pretty
good
i
like
its
more
interesting
i
than
other
euro
pale
lagers
ive
had
i
think
this
one
goes
down
with
the
best
of
them
i
can
through
stella
artois
down
247365
and
not
regret
it
poured
from
a
bottle
its
a
standard
looking
pale
yellow
lager
plenty
of
carbonation
the
nose
is
a
mix
of
yeast
malt
and
grass
the
flavor
is
where
it
all
falls
down
though
its
like
a
mix
of
bad
grolsch
and
heineken
its
predominantly
watery
bitter
malt
with
a
dry
finish
but
lacking
the
metallic
astringency
of
grolsch
and
with
a
particularly
poor
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
but
standard
for
the
variety
because
the
flavor
is
so
bad
drinkability
is
quite
low
d
i
could
drink
a
bunch
but
i
dont
think
its
worth
the
extra
kind
of
boring
actually
overall
its
an
average
beer
but
its
not
worth
the
high
import
cost
that
you
pay
for
it
very
easy
drinkingcleanrefreshingcould
drink
a
few
of
thesebut
would
get
bored
after
a
while
not
enough
taste
to
keep
me
interested
for
a
long
time
drinkability
is
ok
not
my
cup
of
tea
and
certainly
not
the
best
example
of
the
style
i
am
not
impressed
with
this
one
i
would
rather
have
a
michelob
ultra
than
this
just
another
fizzy
euro
import
this
beer
is
heavily
marketed
and
readily
available
in
this
area
this
is
a
very
clear
yellow
lager
with
a
half
inch
of
white
head
not
particularly
lacey
for
a
belgian
but
predictable
for
a
light
underscore
light
the
taste
has
a
bit
of
malt
but
more
of
a
fast
light
bitter
flavor
that
finishes
quick
on
tap
or
bottle
this
beer
is
best
served
cold
for
those
looking
for
a
light
lager
and
a
new
label
try
it
out
this
isnt
rocket
science
just
a
light
beer
that
should
appeal
to
those
who
dont
like
dark
belgians
ipas
well
pretty
much
not
many
beers
i
had
heard
that
i
had
to
try
this
beer
a
lot
when
i
finially
bought
a
sixer
of
it
and
tried
one
i
wasnt
initially
impressed
maybe
because
i
am
inclined
to
dark
beers
but
the
second
beer
seemed
much
better
than
the
first
the
taste
grew
on
me
finially
came
to
the
conclusion
that
this
is
a
good
beer
not
a
standby
but
good
none
the
less
the
appearance
of
this
beer
is
pale
yellow
wabout
a
half
inch
of
head
when
pored
into
a
mug
the
smell
is
unimpressive
wa
sort
of
flat
smell
the
taste
isnt
all
bad
almost
comparible
to
a
light
pilsner
mouthfeel
is
boring
and
the
drikability
is
crisp
the
beer
reminds
me
of
something
you
might
drink
for
a
quick
beer
after
working
outside
all
day
ive
had
stella
before
but
i
gave
it
a
more
thorough
tasting
last
night
as
a
friend
had
a
12
pack
it
had
the
appearance
of
a
pilsner
very
light
a
slight
hoppy
nose
but
nothing
strong
the
taste
was
that
of
a
light
lager
with
a
decent
ammout
of
hops
and
a
slight
malt
aftertaste
pretty
good
very
drinkable
but
nothing
that
stood
out
as
spectacular
though
a
relatively
popular
or
at
least
wellknown
beer
this
isnt
very
impressive
tastes
like
a
generic
euro
lager
that
borders
on
tasting
skunky
average
at
best
but
i
find
that
the
mouthfeel
is
rather
annoying
goes
beyond
tasting
clean
to
tasting
excessively
dry
overall
drinkability
was
nice
again
i
would
reserve
this
for
summer
consumption
on
a
blistering
hot
day
stella
artois
would
quench
a
good
beer
thirst
stella
artois
is
a
light
flavored
lager
similar
to
other
imported
styles
this
reminded
my
of
heineken
the
skunkiness
on
a
beer
that
was
suppose
to
be
fresh
until
july
of
07
was
disappointing
damn
green
bottles
id
be
eager
to
try
this
on
tap
to
see
if
its
any
better
i
dont
know
the
inside
workings
of
this
company
but
their
marketing
department
seems
to
have
put
a
full
court
press
on
new
england
it
is
popping
up
all
over
the
place
it
sort
of
reminds
me
of
ten
years
ago
when
rolling
rock
was
doing
the
same
thing
all
the
bars
and
restaurants
started
promoting
the
geen
bottles
the
difference
is
at
least
to
me
that
stella
is
a
much
better
beer
its
perfect
when
you
look
down
the
line
of
taps
and
see
macro
after
macro
so
whatever
the
reason
im
glad
stella
is
becoming
readily
available
in
the
last
two
years
it
pours
a
nice
golden
yellow
its
sweet
and
light
ladies
seem
to
like
it
more
than
other
beers
it
doesnt
have
the
stigma
of
malternitives
and
light
beers
its
just
a
good
drinking
beer
nice
smell
nice
flavor
wont
be
blow
you
away
but
is
tasty
and
predictable
and
its
good
for
sharing
with
friends
not
a
bad
beer
reminds
of
a
light
beerthough
not
a
heavy
beer
like
other
lagers
light
golden
color
when
i
had
it
on
tap
it
had
head
and
lace
till
the
last
drop
the
bottle
was
some
what
the
same
i
would
drink
it
again
if
it
was
on
sale
but
not
to
get
again
i
bought
the
12
pavk
to
share
with
another
beer
lover
that
hadnt
try
it
this
is
my
first
stella
artois
came
in
a
beers
of
belgium
18
pack
along
with
leffe
and
hoegaarden
from
sams
poured
from
a
11
2
oz
green
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
with
large
bubbles
that
dissipates
to
a
minimul
head
the
smell
struck
me
at
first
as
a
typical
euro
beer
with
a
slight
skunk
smell
but
after
taking
several
more
smells
it
leaves
a
sweet
malty
should
i
say
inviting
smell
the
taste
is
malty
with
a
lingering
bitter
hops
in
the
back
it
also
has
a
very
faint
banana
spice
flavor
i
m
not
sure
taste
something
else
thats
hard
for
me
to
describe
this
is
just
my
second
review
just
learning
how
to
take
the
time
to
truly
taste
a
beer
the
mouth
feel
is
light
slightly
carbonated
i
could
see
myself
drinking
quite
a
few
of
these
this
would
be
a
great
summer
beer
and
one
i
may
introduce
to
my
bmc
friends
as
a
possible
crossover
a
nice
crisp
lager
nothing
earthshaking
but
a
nice
beer
a
good
euromacro
alternative
to
american
macro
and
would
probably
be
acceptable
to
most
american
macro
drinkers
excepting
those
that
cant
handle
actual
hops
at
all
i
despise
most
pils
and
lager
for
me
beer
is
about
flavour
and
complexity
both
which
stella
artois
lacks
undeniably
however
due
to
its
popularity
its
a
perfect
carton
to
haul
along
to
a
party
d
this
is
where
stella
shines
because
you
can
have
this
beer
everyday
and
not
get
sick
of
it
i
imagine
you
can
drink
multiple
bottlesglasses
but
i
dont
know
why
youd
want
to
pours
a
golden
yellow
with
lots
of
carbonation
and
a
tight
bubbled
head
that
leaves
a
nice
lace
around
the
glass
has
maybe
an
aroma
of
vienna
malt
perhaps
pilsen
a
nice
hop
aroma
goes
along
to
balance
the
malt
flavors
an
excellent
example
of
a
nice
clean
lager
check
out
the
website
to
see
how
to
perfectly
pour
this
lager
mouthfeel
is
ok
not
too
thin
and
carbonation
feels
about
right
to
me
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
cant
really
fathom
a
reason
to
drink
it
in
lieu
of
something
else
given
the
world
full
of
better
alternatives
we
have
before
us
one
could
drink
this
as
a
session
beer
but
there
are
better
choices
an
above
average
example
of
the
somewhat
under
appreciated
euro
pale
lager
style
definitely
a
couple
of
steps
up
from
heineken
and
featuring
a
cleaner
malt
character
than
grolsch
recommended
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
but
an
average
one
it
is
a
classic
euro
lager
and
would
be
good
ice
cold
on
a
hot
day
at
7
a
sixpack
i
think
its
over
priced
i
can
get
better
beer
for
less
so
i
doubt
ill
have
this
again
the
pours
is
a
light
straw
gold
with
a
descent
head
that
quickly
fades
into
a
light
lace
aroma
was
expected
for
this
style
light
and
hoppy
the
carbonation
is
long
lasting
and
very
crisp
the
flavors
balance
was
surprisingly
good
with
a
a
nice
sweet
malt
coupled
with
a
bitter
hops
presence
just
strong
enough
to
compliment
the
sweet
mouthfeel
was
also
as
expected
however
the
long
lasting
crispness
of
the
carbonation
was
a
nice
treat
drinkability
is
very
good
due
to
the
light
crisp
combination
of
flavors
and
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
decent
brew
that
caught
me
a
little
off
guard
on
the
positive
side
drink
this
one
as
cold
as
you
can
get
it
and
its
very
enjoyable
d
really
one
of
the
least
tasting
european
lagers
out
there
its
really
like
a
japanese
domestic
with
a
slight
hop
bite
towards
the
end
for
me
this
is
probably
one
of
the
most
over
rated
beers
in
the
world
i
really
dont
know
why
people
drink
it
poured
this
beer
bottle
into
a
glass
mug
a
nice
amber
appearance
with
a
decent
white
head
with
good
retention
smelled
slightly
bitter
tasted
very
smooth
with
a
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
that
was
actually
quite
complimenting
a
decent
mouthfeel
a
little
bit
more
watery
than
what
i
was
expecting
overall
a
drinkable
beer
i
was
able
to
drink
this
things
all
night
long
not
too
filling
and
the
initial
bitterness
goes
away
once
you
get
things
going
and
it
begins
to
taste
a
lot
smoother
no
its
not
due
to
being
drunk
because
i
didnt
even
approach
buzzed
at
all
tonight
all
in
all
its
a
nice
average
lager
with
a
slightly
better
than
average
taste
good
with
a
light
meal
or
something
to
drink
at
lunch
when
you
have
to
go
back
to
work
my
girlfriend
likes
it
which
is
weird
cause
she
can
down
a
dead
guy
in
like
ten
minutes
lightbodied
watery
fizzy
nothing
wrong
with
it
but
also
nothing
to
it
drinkable
but
light
and
not
fulfilling
beautiful
packaging
for
the
bottle
too
bad
the
insides
doesnt
live
up
pours
a
light
golden
color
with
a
thick
head
my
initial
reaction
was
to
the
strong
hoppy
smell
but
by
the
time
i
finished
i
couldnt
tell
it
apart
from
an
american
macropilsner
nice
amount
of
carbonation
followed
by
a
nice
bitter
hop
flavor
the
initial
aftertaste
is
a
sour
citrus
that
is
quickly
replaced
by
a
doughy
bready
flavor
that
taste
lasts
until
the
next
sip
the
flavor
coated
my
entire
mouth
which
was
annoying
since
it
wasnt
really
that
great
of
a
taste
that
said
its
still
a
fairly
easy
to
drink
beer
and
is
defiantly
a
huge
improvement
over
some
of
the
more
common
alternatives
stella
is
an
excellent
lager
and
i
wished
more
were
like
it
it
pours
goldenyellow
and
its
clean
white
head
disapates
quickly
a
light
malty
smell
and
taste
is
very
hoppy
though
with
a
nice
malty
sweetness
good
carbonation
and
its
very
crisp
and
refreshing
good
drinkability
and
when
on
tap
ill
put
away
a
few
of
these
drinakabilitypretty
good
this
one
was
bottled
ive
had
this
beer
on
tap
to
even
if
you
dont
like
the
bottled
version
try
it
on
tap
if
you
can
find
it
id
rate
the
tap
version
a
full
point
higher
had
this
at
dinner
poured
a
dull
pale
fizzy
yellow
white
seltzer
head
which
faded
to
nothing
no
lace
hardly
a
smell
i
guess
a
light
malt
if
anything
taste
was
very
bland
should
have
known
that
was
coming
this
is
your
typical
macro
lager
will
not
have
another
ive
had
this
beer
a
couple
of
times
one
at
a
nice
little
place
here
in
dc
and
another
at
a
rather
strange
placetime
in
up
state
new
york
both
times
this
beer
was
constantly
good
the
color
is
about
what
you
would
expect
out
of
a
euro
lager
light
yellow
with
little
depth
in
color
the
head
was
nice
about
a
half
an
inch
thick
i
like
this
for
this
style
of
beer
personally
with
a
good
about
of
lacing
i
thought
that
the
smell
was
decent
i
didnt
notice
the
skunk
smell
a
lot
of
the
other
reviews
had
written
about
but
maybe
i
just
had
a
different
experience
the
taste
was
pleasant
nutty
and
rich
very
smooth
for
a
pale
lager
the
finish
was
clean
and
my
palate
ready
for
more
a
good
beer
that
can
be
enjoyed
almost
anytime
of
the
year
cheers
this
beer
poured
a
light
golden
tone
with
a
small
head
the
smell
was
fairly
light
with
an
aroma
of
malt
and
a
bit
of
hops
the
flavor
had
a
lightmedium
body
and
a
lightmedium
hop
flavor
and
bitterness
i
also
had
a
nice
very
subtle
malt
aftertaste
as
well
the
mouthfeel
was
lighter
in
consistency
and
had
a
medium
carbonation
overall
i
felt
that
this
beer
was
very
crisp
and
clean
although
its
body
was
a
bit
lighter
than
im
used
to
it
was
still
a
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
beer
i
would
definately
reccomend
trying
it
dnot
bad
but
i
didnt
remember
it
tasting
like
this
ill
have
more
but
not
anytime
soon
ima
gonna
have
a
couple
more
light
golden
color
and
mediocre
white
foamy
cap
floral
hop
esters
yeasty
sweet
bread
and
little
fruity
in
the
nose
crisp
descent
bitterness
champagne
like
astringent
mild
sweetness
but
bigger
in
the
finish
along
with
some
yeast
yet
still
relatively
clean
thin
body
and
mouthfeel
with
some
fizz
honey
sweetness
and
slight
grape
skin
tannin
arrive
late
good
carbonation
throughout
note
green
bottles
are
stupid
this
poured
a
very
pale
straw
color
with
a
moderate
sized
head
good
retention
clean
smell
of
grassy
hops
the
taste
is
about
as
average
as
average
can
get
nothing
bad
at
all
but
nothing
exciting
either
very
clean
and
pure
with
a
bit
of
sweetness
and
a
bit
of
hops
but
very
ordinary
goes
down
incredibly
easily
and
you
will
have
the
whole
thing
done
in
a
minute
if
you
arent
careful
not
because
of
anything
outstanding
but
because
its
such
an
easy
beer
it
is
very
light
in
color
a
golden
straw
color
with
a
good
deal
of
carbonation
its
very
light
in
basically
all
areas
aroma
taste
body
and
appearance
i
guess
thats
why
americans
like
it
so
with
the
american
macros
this
stands
a
level
above
as
it
does
have
some
flavor
qualities
its
aroma
is
grainy
with
a
slight
sweetness
much
true
to
for
the
taste
the
water
taste
is
particularly
belgian
but
thats
about
it
its
drinkable
but
nothing
i
would
crave
i
dont
recommend
this
product
for
anything
else
other
than
when
youre
sampling
various
lagers
it
costs
too
much
to
be
as
weak
as
it
is
in
flavor
its
almost
a
stereotypical
cheap
beer
with
expensive
packaging
not
my
favorite
taste
is
bland
another
light
thirstquencher
not
offensive
or
special
ive
had
stella
in
a
bottle
before
and
it
was
ok
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
or
write
ba
about
then
i
tried
it
on
tap
and
was
a
bit
more
impressed
still
not
worthy
of
a
session
beer
but
it
went
great
with
wings
and
crab
dip
at
our
celebration
congratulations
pilot
n
color
was
wan
yellow
in
the
glass
with
a
nice
pillowy
head
lost
a
lot
of
carbonation
in
the
pouring
process
visavis
the
bottle
version
but
that
improved
it
imho
a
bit
of
skunky
hops
in
the
smell
and
the
same
in
the
taste
which
was
a
bit
of
a
putoff
for
me
rather
thin
mouthful
but
sweetness
and
bitterness
in
perfect
balance
for
food
id
try
it
again
with
a
meal
den
on
tap
clear
with
medium
head
that
fell
fast
light
color
strong
aroma
of
noble
hops
and
a
distinct
hops
bite
on
the
first
sip
refreshing
almost
sour
from
the
hops
kick
technical
perfection
but
no
soul
perhaps
the
keg
was
getting
old
but
the
hops
aroma
was
almost
oxidized
and
was
almost
too
much
for
such
a
light
lager
dont
get
me
wrong
its
better
than
american
macros
but
there
are
so
many
better
beers
to
come
out
of
that
country
i
have
not
tried
any
other
stella
beers
but
i
would
like
to
since
this
one
seems
to
be
aimed
at
the
same
blokes
that
make
bud
the
most
popular
beer
in
the
world
and
i
know
they
can
do
better
d
very
easy
thirst
quenching
d
its
a
mild
inoffensive
beer
in
a
mild
inoffensive
style
but
its
not
terrible
and
it
has
more
to
recommend
it
than
bmc
on
the
one
hand
this
beer
is
built
so
that
you
can
drink
a
ton
of
them
on
the
other
hand
its
not
the
kind
of
beer
that
draws
you
in
and
actually
makes
you
desire
to
have
more
than
one
or
two
its
sweet
its
mild
and
its
a
last
resort
beer
for
me
when
im
at
a
restaurant
but
its
solid
and
doesnt
make
me
want
to
start
a
youll
never
believe
what
i
had
to
drink
thread
in
the
forums
good
beer
definitely
worth
a
try
most
uniuqe
thing
about
it
is
according
to
my
waitress
was
that
when
been
served
in
a
glass
it
has
to
be
served
in
a
special
stella
artois
glass
with
a
gold
rim
not
sure
if
the
brewery
is
requiring
the
shape
of
the
glass
for
the
tasting
or
what
i
am
still
a
rookie
at
beer
tasting
pours
a
two
finger
white
head
with
nice
lacing
to
the
finish
nice
clear
light
gold
color
smell
is
fresh
but
not
much
else
distinguishable
there
taste
has
a
ginger
grain
alochol
slight
hop
after
taste
mouthfeel
light
clean
crisp
dry
drinkability
is
good
its
something
i
would
not
buy
all
the
time
though
good
for
a
change
of
pace
this
beer
was
sampled
after
allmost
a
month
at
sea
where
there
was
no
beer
available
so
for
quenching
my
thirst
and
a
cold
beer
it
served
its
purpose
overall
it
tastes
like
most
of
the
other
euro
lagers
would
i
buy
it
upon
my
return
to
the
states
probably
not
pours
a
crystal
clear
pale
golden
straw
color
with
a
thin
fizzy
white

that
quickly
vanishes
nose
is
herbal

with
a

taste

some
grassy
notes
and
dry
grains
along
with

mildly
spicy

the
end
fizzy
mouthfeel
decent
lawn
mowing

nothing
more
crisp
cool
a
bit
overcarbonated
not
a
bad
light
beer
cant
even
taste
the
5
2
abv
drank
very
easy
wouldnt
want
to
stay
on
it
all
day
but
could
if
that
was
the
best
beer
on
offer
nothing
too
exotic
here
just
a
real
quaffable
lager
nothing
to
special
about
this
lager
mouthfeel
high
carbonation
kinda
gets
in
the
way
of
the
weak
flavor
of
this
beer
the
beer
goes
down
super
smooth
and
is
very
easy
to
drink
however
i
wouldnt
want
to
drink
this
all
night
just
because
i
know
that
theres
better
out
there
however
i
do
believe
that
this
beer
would
work
wonders
as
a
crossover
beer
definitely
prefer
these
from
the
tap
thought
im
a
fan
of
the
bottle
overall
just
some
average
european
pale
lager
nothing
special
here
as
with
any
beer
the
draft
tastes
better
then
the
bottle
but
that
also
depends
on
where
you
got
it
from
this
is
a
classic
boring
lager
no
significant
flavor
other
than
some
bitterness
mouthfeeldrinkability
the
slick
rolling
carbonation
in
the
mouth
feels
just
right
it
certainly
works
with
food
this
beer
has
the
unique
character
of
being
lightbodied
yet
very
satisfying
and
drinkability
is
excellent
much
to
my
surprise
this
beer
definitely
has
its
place
on
a
hot
day
overall
one
of
the
better
tasting
euro
pales
but
its
a
mediocre
beer
compared
to
the
rest
of
the
beer
world
poured
a
pale
straw
colour
fizziness
abound
with
what
could
best
be
described
as
a
white
foamy
scum
on
the
top
consisting
of
large
bubbles
and
a
smell
which
hits
you
on
pouring
rancid
wet
cardboard
slightly
sweaty
with
a
corn
character
which
is
probably
chemical
in
origin
for
all
i
know
the
sweet
taste
had
a
nasty
kind
of
bitter
finish
which
clings
to
the
palate
for
dear
life
i
noticed
a
taste
of
alcohol
even
though
its
only
5
4
a
fizzy
watery
concoction
which
if
it
was
stronger
could
qualify
for
tramp
juice
i
think
the
advertising
owes
a
lot
to
the
success
of
this
abomination
in
these
here
parts
making
it
seem
more
sophisticated
than
it
is
that
said
if
you
just
want
to
get
trashed
after
a
rubbish
week
in
work
then
this
is
the
poison
to
do
it
with
although
if
you
enjoy
good
beer
have
a
curry
with
it
to
overpower
the
taste
it
is
highly
drinkable
though
must
be
consumed
cold
its
solid
for
the
style
didnt
think
much
of
this
even
less
because
i
let
it
warm
as
i
drank
it
that
is
fine
for
belgians
stouts
and
barleywines
but
this
beer
needs
to
be
drank
ice
cold
the
beginning
aroma
and
flavor
were
not
much
and
they
got
worse
as
it
warmed
finish
was
similar
to
drinking
a
bmc
dry
with
a
bitter
aftertaste
i
could
have
these
at
a
party
if
free
and
cold
but
doubt
ill
be
spending
money
on
this
again
light
body
with
a
wet
watery
mouthfeel
its
easy
to
consume
and
is
quite
refreshing
i
think
its
much
easier
to
drink
than
american
macros
and
is
a
good
example
of
its
style
stella
artois
is
your
typical
st
pauli
girl
type
lager
these
euro
lagers
are
all
morphing
into
the
same
blah
boring
category
while
not
offensive
and
quite
drinkable
stella
isnt
worth
the
premium
price
ill
likely
be
stocking
my
fridge
with
this
in
the
future
poured
into
a
stella
artois
glass
pours
a
pale
golden
yellow
with
a
thin
head
that
turns
into
sporadic
lace
typical
dry
and
clean
lager
aroma
with
sweet
grain
and
grassy
hops
taste
is
a
bit
spicy
and
earthy
with
a
decent
touch
of
hops
not
too
bad
overall
this
is
a
decent
lager
but
not
worth
the
premium
price
tag
pours
pale
yellow
with
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
leaving
a
few
random
spots
of
foam
floating
there
smells
like
adjucts
corn
rice
not
much
flavor
maybe
a
little
hop
bitterness
tastes
like
any
other
euro
lager
the
mouth
feel
while
thin
is
more
present
then
i
would
expect
this
beer
isnt
really
much
different
then
heineken
or
any
other
euro
lager
i
wouldnt
reccomend
this
one
im
not
a
big
fan
of
euro
pale
lagers
but
this
i
found
less
offensive
than
say
a
heineken
overall
i
think
the
taste
isnt
really
anything
great
but
with
the
mouthfeel
it
gives
this
beer
a
very
drinkable
aspect
i
think
without
the
mouthfeel
this
beer
would
be
kinda
forgetable
but
it
beats
the
crap
outta
heineken
and
all
the
likes
as
far
as
belgiums
stardards
this
sucks
i
think
most
of
us
will
agree
although
marketed
as
a
premium
beer
i
saw
on
their
web
site
that
they
use
corn
and
rice
as
adjuncts
likely
in
very
small
amounts
but
that
puts
this
beer
on
the
macrobrew
class
not
a
bad
beer
just
a
decent
macrobrew
i
prefer
heinenken
or
grolsch
for
a
pale
euro
lager
big
time
this
beer
poured
a
clear
yellow
with
a
small
but
persistent
head
the
smell
was
faint
but
slightly
hoppy
it
has
a
mild
taste
that
isnt
outstanding
or
offensive
the
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
with
a
carbonation
bite
this
is
a
nice
beer
that
i
would
definitely
consider
when
in
the
mood
for
a
pale
lager
stella
has
always
been
my
favorite
lager
without
going
into
the
ambers
and
viennas
and
blah
blah
blah
this
beer
is
sweet
and
easy
to
drink
and
i
like
that
poured
into
the
stella
artois
chalice
and
actually
looks
damn
good
inside
it
for
how
yellow
it
looks
champagneesque
with
a
respectably
flowing
white
head
that
youre
supposed
to
cut
with
the
provided
stella
artois
barknife
they
are
really
reaching
for
image
here
bottle
and
carriage
has
always
been
eye
catching
to
me
with
the
classy
white
smell
is
average
lots
of
malt
and
very
floral
thats
where
the
taste
comes
in
sweet
and
floral
with
no
offensiveness
the
perfectly
crafted
lager
in
my
opinion
the
sweetness
is
just
amazing
for
a
mass
produced
beer
have
one
of
these
after
a
pilsner
urquell
and
its
heaven
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
above
average
lots
of
bubbles
and
brings
up
the
champagne
reference
again
drinkability
is
damn
good
like
ive
been
saying
definitely
my
favorite
lager
albeit
too
expensive
sometimes
and
they
screw
you
with
that
little
11
2
oz
bottle
oh
well
highly
recommend
m
strong
carbonation
and
watery
overall
a
pretty
bland
beer
to
watery
among
other
problems
drinkability
easy
drinker
by
far
seems
though
not
worth
it
at
all
its
just
such
a
bland
beer
really
i
think
it
might
be
a
good
beer
for
someone
to
be
introduced
to
beer
with
stella
artois
is
rather
mediocre
but
its
certainly
superior
to
budmillercoors
and
for
the
beer
drinker
who
is
trying
to
get
away
from
those
its
a
step
up
ill
likely
not
buy
it
again
but
i
did
get
a
cool
glass
so
im
not
going
to
whine
bottom
line
stella
artois
is
not
offensive
but
its
not
my
beer
either
picked
up
a
6
pack
of
this
because
i
wanted
something
different
poured
a
simple
pale
yellow
colour
with
ample
head
may
have
been
a
bit
warm
from
the
ride
home
initial
eurolager
smell
gave
way
to
sweet
malt
and
hops
taste
was
well
pretty
darn
good
good
sweet
malt
taste
with
a
floral
finish
no
real
bitterness
detected
i
think
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
as
it
is
pretty
good
for
the
price
i
had
this
beer
on
a
night
when
a
buddy
of
mine
and
i
were
trying
what
was
new
on
tap
in
carbondale
illinois
i
had
about
3
or
4
beers
prior
to
this
one
and
was
on
the
road
to
having
a
pretty
decent
night
then
i
ordered
a
stella
at
buffalo
wild
wings
it
looked
like
a
standard
lager
and
smelled
about
standard
but
when
it
hit
my
tongue
it
tasted
unpleasantly
skunky
keep
in
mind
this
was
on
tap
otherwise
i
would
just
have
written
it
off
as
some
bottles
left
in
the
sun
i
let
my
buddy
take
a
sip
hes
a
bigger
beer
advocate
than
me
and
he
quickly
passed
it
back
over
making
note
of
its
unpleasant
flavor
kind
of
like
a
uberskunky
heineken
i
suppose
the
worst
part
about
the
flavor
is
that
it
seemed
to
intensify
in
the
aftertaste
ugh
i
didnt
even
finish
it
i
had
about
two
more
beers
after
that
and
could
never
seem
to
get
rid
of
that
awful
taste
on
my
tongue
later
that
night
i
awoke
from
my
sleep
to
rush
to
the
toilet
something
i
havent
done
since
having
way
too
many
mixed
drinks
on
new
years
eve
to
purge
my
system
of
the
awful
stuff
needless
to
say
i
definately
dont
get
the
hype
surrounding
this
awful
lager
stay
away
from
it
stay
far
far
away
this
is
a
beer
that
has
become
available
in
my
local
area
very
recently
and
it
seems
to
have
a
big
following
nationwide
that
in
itself
leads
one
to
assume
the
beers
mildness
of
flavor
is
behind
its
popularity
since
the
general
beer
drinking
public
considers
it
palatable
dont
get
me
started
on
the
sales
of
the
urine
sample
labeled
bud
light
that
being
said
fellow
bas
seemed
to
have
ripped
stella
a
new
onestanley
kowalski
not
withstanding
i
prefer
porters
stouts
and
ales
in
general
but
have
tried
to
review
this
lager
with
the
reference
of
the
beer
style
in
mind
it
is
very
mild
across
the
board
it
has
a
mild
hoppy
finish
and
is
very
easy
drinking
especially
when
its
hot
outside
i
had
several
while
visiting
my
brother
in
charleston
sc
and
it
was
hot
as
hell
i
would
consider
this
an
upgrade
from
most
macrobrewed
domestics
with
the
exception
of
yuengling
look
for
big
beer
taste
elsewhere
but
when
a
lake
trip
requires
a
better
than
u
s
macro
talk
to
stella
unlike
many
of
my
brethren
bas
i
enjoy
a
walk
on
the
mild
side
occasionally
and
stella
certainly
fit
the
bill
poured
into
a
stella
glass
pale
yellow
with
a
nice
34
1
inch
head
which
lasted
a
short
while
and
left
some
nice
lacing
the
smell
was
nothing
special
typical
lager
maltiness
with
nothing
else
really
discernable
to
me
anyway
taste
was
average
as
well
started
off
sweet
malty
and
ended
with
a
slight
hint
of
hops
nothing
special
but
nowhere
near
disgusting
however
it
goes
down
very
smooth
and
is
light
bodied
and
very
refreshing
something
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
given
the
right
conditions
i
found
the
carbination
to
be
just
right
and
what
it
lacks
in
complex
flavours
i
think
it
makes
up
in
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
i
know
this
beer
gets
a
bad
rap
for
being
overrated
but
as
far
as
im
concerned
its
one
of
the
better
popular
lagers
out
there
ill
have
to
try
some
bottles
i
still
cannot
figure
out
what
style
of
beer
this
is
or
is
trying
to
be
is
it
a
belgian
blonde
no
er
lets
hope
not
a
belgian
lager
what
is
that
anyway
this
is
one
of
the
10
worst
beers
ever
no
head
whatsoever
no
lacing
barely
any
taste
except
some
foul
skunky
aftertaste
just
the
way
it
smells
is
appalling
very
skunky
no
sugary
belgian
candies
nothing
ive
had
this
a
couple
times
but
this
is
finally
the
last
time
d
although
it
looks
good
and
feels
good
thi
is
just
another
beer
to
chuck
into
the
drink
these
on
a
warm
day
bin
that
contains
all
of
the
other
lowtaste
massmarket
europale
lagers
can
you
drink
a
few
of
these
at
a
backyard
bbq
absolutely
but
only
if
there
were
no
other
craftbrew
options
available
o
tastes
like
heineken
to
me
bland
and
boring
maybe
its
good
fresh
from
the
source
this
stuff
is
just
very
run
of
the
mill
light
in
appearance
flavor
and
body
watered
down
full
of
corn
it
did
have
a
decent
head
but
it
evaporated
quickly
highly
carbonated
and
fizzy
i
dont
know
seems
like
somebody
wanted
to
import
a
beer
any
beer
and
make
some
dough
i
wouldnt
buy
this
product
again
it
is
better
than
heine
light
becks
light
and
all
the
michs
other
than
that
pass
wellbalanced
beer
one
of
the
best
european
macrolagers
it
has
a
clear
golden
yellow
color
with
lots
of
bubbles
and
little
head
it
smelled
of
corn
there
was
also
a
faint
skunky
smell
which
seems
typical
of
most
green
bottled
european
brews
the
corn
flavor
comes
out
as
you
drink
it
i
also
noted
a
vanillalike
taste
as
well
it
had
a
crisp
mouthfeel
and
was
quite
drinkable
i
wouldve
had
more
but
i
only
had
one
on
hand
eh
i
usually
drink
them
in
the
bottle
and
i
think
it
surpresses
the
worst
flavors
this
is
not
the
beer
you
want
to
probe
deeply
for
nuances
way
expensive
considering
its
lackluster
qualities
i
had
heard
of
this
beer
through
new
ads
in
magazines
and
television
did
not
know
it
existed
especially
since
1366
as
marked
on
the
bottle
purchased
a
six
pack
poured
into
frosty
cold
pint
glass
tasted
almost
the
same
as
heineken
same
body
and
smell
average
but
very
drinkable
a
good
hot
weather
outdoor
pilsner
would
buy
again
this
beer
looks
like
a
classic
pilsner
with
a
head
that
is
very
thin
but
hangs
on
for
the
long
haul
it
gives
a
musty
bread
and
soap
aroma
the
taste
is
a
light
bodied
crackertasting
malt
base
and
opening
lemonlime
sensations
have
light
berry
notes
that
grow
to
an
overall
impression
of
a
mouthfull
of
cheap
gummy
bears
before
they
are
all
drowned
in
a
forcefull
metallic
bitter
in
other
words
this
shit
is
funky
it
has
none
of
the
clean
crisp
characteristics
i
look
for
in
this
style
i
syrupy
mouthfeel
with
stingy
carbonation
dont
help
matters
but
this
is
a
refreshing
brew
inspite
of
itself
a
perfect
example
of
a
lager
style
beer
the
only
thing
i
dont
like
about
this
beer
is
the
price
8
50
a
sixer
this
beer
could
only
be
improved
if
it
where
to
be
made
right
in
minnesota
in
a
brewpub
run
by
german
brewmasters
it
has
the
right
color
the
right
mouth
feel
and
smells
of
hops
and
grains
very
fresh
the
flavor
is
brought
out
to
its
peak
if
you
let
it
slightly
warm
out
of
the
fridge
to
about
45
0r
50
degrees
drinkability
drinkable
but
that
skunked
thing
hurts
it
d
id
never
buy
it
the
body
is
surprisingly
big
for
a
pale
lager
not
bad
i
would
drink
more
but
there
are
much
more
interesting
beers
on
the
lighter
end
of
the
spectrum
glad
i
was
finally
able
to
at
least
try
it
after
having
worked
at
a
beer
store
for
over
a
year
that
had
almost
every
belgian
beer
imaginable
but
stella
which
was
the
only
thing
anybody
ever
wanted
aside
from
hoegaarden
decent
brew
similiar
to
heineken
nothing
to
write
home
about
as
far
as
smell
is
concerned
kind
of
bitter
appearance
is
ok
a
typical
amber
color
taste
is
pretty
basic
nothing
really
jumps
out
about
this
beer
it
goes
down
smooth
and
i
enjoyed
having
it
with
a
chicken
sandwichfrench
fries
dinner
at
the
local
chilis
but
this
didnt
bowl
me
over
overall
a
nice
brew
maybe
not
quite
the
cleanest
out
there
but
the
aroma
keeps
me
enticed
throughout
the
whole
experience
it
stands
apart
from
other
beers
i
have
tried
in
the
euro
pale
lager
category
a
fine
and
refreshing
brew
but
nothing
extraordinary
overall
a
very
average
beer
quite
drinkable
though
d
not
bad
but
certainly
onedimensional
well
maybe
2
dimensional
without
much
complexity
and
strangely
not
particularly
refreshing
nothing
special
anyway
i
would
drink
this
any
day
of
the
week
and
will
be
sure
to
pick
up
a
sixer
in
the
store
this
is
a
mediocre
beer
at
best
pours
out
to
a
light
yellow
color
with
a
thin
head
of
white
foam
medium
level
of
carbonation
and
some
trace
of
lace
aroma
is
grassy
with
a
touch
of
floral
hops
taste
bland
watery
hops
leave
a
dry
note
in
the
mouth
along
with
a
touch
of
bite
from
the
hops
and
a
sharp
grass
note
toward
the
finish
mouthfeel
was
ok
but
a
touch
more
carbonation
wouldve
been
grand
drinkability
is
average
at
best
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
but
to
call
it
a
belgian
seems
like
travisty
compared
to
other
belgian
products
i
remember
having
this
on
tap
several
times
awhile
back
and
the
slight
skunky
metallic
taste
was
not
present
still
average
to
slightly
above
average

really

to

this

and

only
5

was

to
pour
another
d
this
beer
is
pretty
bland
with
the
exceptions
of
fizz
and
hop
extract
and
there
isnt
really
any
balance
or
support
from
other
good
flavors
it
wasnt
skunky
although
i
could
see
this
happening
with
the
green

pretty
quickly
drinkability
good

not
extreme
considering
the

sessionable
no

very
boring
to
me
taste
is
also
quite
malty
off

with

im
very

according
to

description
this
beer
fits
pretty
damn
well
the

is
grainy

the

both
noble

great
beer
to

the
night
off
with
poured
a
fairly
clear
golden
color
with
good
head
the
smell
was
almost
nonexistent
maybe
some
apples
mixed
in
with
a
little
malt
the
taste
was
especially
sweet
with
some
but
not
many
hops
showing
through
at
the
end
overall
this
beer
seemed
fairly
thin
and
had
too
much
carbonation
it
makes
for
a
decent
complement
to
dinner
but
there
are
a

more
interesting

out

from

the

me
of

d
stella
isnt
much
to
drink
it
has
a
poor
flavor
and
smell
it
really
is
not
even
worth
drinking
i
guess
that
stella
is
bland
enough
to
wash
down
food
sessionable
but
not
by
choice
overall
these
are
somewhat
dangerous
as
clean
and
balanced
as
these
are
its
easy
to
polish
off
several
before
youve
realized
what
happened
and
its
not
because
theres
no
flavor
thats
there
drinkability
was
good
with
my
dinner
pairing
at
the
same
restaurant
i
would
consider
this
depending
on
the
plate
ordered
but
on
its
own
merits
i
wont
be
adding
this
to
my
must
purchase
list
i
always
thought
whenever
my
wife
drank
this
beer
that
it
was
sort
of
belgian
corona
its
really
not
that
bad
it
was
a
pale
yellow
color
with
a
thin
head
that
dissipated
quickly
it
had
a
nice
fresh
outdoors
odor
and
a
sweetgrainy
taste
with
a
little
tiny
bit
of
hoppiness
neutral
feeling
in
my
mouth
and
an
ok
beer
to
drink
mouthfeel
is
sharp
more
carbonated
than
i
expected
light
but
the
nice
bitterness
and
carbonation
make
stella
a
potential
session
beer
if
nothing
else
as
an
alternative
to
an
aml
good
middleoftheroad
example
of
the
style

this
one
on

also
clean
with
a

it

this
is
a

this
beer
seeems
to
building
a

not
necessarily

quite
drinkable

it

it

some
of

do
not
know
too
much
about
euro
pale
lagers
but
nonetheless
i
do
find
this
beer
enjoyable
tastes
like
a
typical
european
beer
would
usually
finished
dry
and
clean
with
slight
astringent
bitterness
overall
impression
eh
fairly
easy
to
drink
but
so
is
water
a
bit
bitter
for
the
style
but
i
guess
it
gives
it
some
character
dont
think
id
cross
the
street
to
try
it
again
but
wouldnt
refuse
it
if
offered
to
me
at
a
party
pours
a
generic
translucent
gold
color
with
a
quick
dissipating
head
smell
is
pretty
homogeneous
smelling
like
hops
and
barley
with
wheat
the
taste
is
pretty
generic
also
for
a
lager
i
would
say
the
only
redeeming
thing
about
this
beer
is
that
if
you
are
looking
to
have
more
than
one
of
anything
this
is
a
good
place
to
start
looking
a
decent
session
lager
probably
recieves
more
crap
than
it
deserves
from
bas
and
the
like
but
also
recieves
too
much
attention
and
praise
from
people
not
in
the
know
to
many
people
this
is
belgian
beer
which
is
unfortunate
with
that
being
said
this
is
a
decent
session
brew
not
nearly
as
skunky
as
many
other
euro
lagers
of
its
style
served
out
of
a
green
bottle
into
a
pilsner
glass
aroma
is
a
little
sweet
slighly
hoppy
taste
is
crisp
clean
a
little
sweet
a
little
hop
bitterness
in
the
end
doesnt
have
the
nasty
adjunct
taste
stuff
like
heineken
has
i
would
say
that
this
is
an
alternative
to
stuff
like
bud
etc
that
is
on
tap
everywhere
except
that
this
beer
is
priced
as
a
highend
brew
sometimes
even
ultrahighend
not
worth
the
extra
price
if
you
ask
me
if
it
were
cheaper
id
probably
buy
it
more
often
this
was
a
tasty
beer
on
a
hot
day
on
a
recent
trip
to
florida
i
dont
feel
that
it
was
necessarily
special
in
any
one
particular
way
but
just
good
it
reminded
me
of
a
heinekin
at
first
with
a
slightly
skunky
smell
some
find
that
offputting
but
to
me
its
just
another
unique
character
to
certain
beers
it
had
a
nice
pour
with
a
head
that
disapated
quickly
not
the
most
desirable
quality
i
thought
the
taste
was
typical
of
a
lager
with
that
slight
flowery
hoppyness
to
it
i
never
really
feel
that
mouthfeel
applies
much
to
this
kind
of
beer
it
should
be
light
and
go
down
easy
and
it
did
i
would
consider
this
a
very
drinkable
beer
although
a
bit
pricey
in
some
locales
although
i
didn
t
have
more
than
one
on
this
occasion
i
wouldnt
rule
it
out
as
a
sessions
beer
based
on
taste
and
quality
alone
the
pint
came
out
with
a
nice
lite
and
clear
yellow
white
head
but
again
with
the
euro
lagers
that
sulfur
skunk
peaked
its
head
up
in
the
aroma
and
slightly
in
the
taste
still
a
lightly
hoppy
brew
with
a
grain
base
thin
mouth
of
course
but
i
just
cant
make
a
long
go
of
euro
brews
with
the
skunk

one
or
two
ok
this
is
a
underrated
euro
lager
but
to
each
their
own
it
is
head
and
shoulders
above
the
rest
of
the
macro
euro
lagers
it
pours
a
nice
light
golden
color
and
has
a
nice
white
head
that
sticks
around
for
most
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
a
nice
bready
malt
with
a
little
bit
of
hops
the
flavor
is
nice
and
clean
nothing
spectacular
but
then
this
is
a
lager
not
a
barleywine
it
has
a
decent
hop
bite
that
is
missing
from
most
macros
it
tastes
like
heineken
used
to
taste
before
it
was
ruined
the
only
thing
that
holds
this
beer
back
is
its
price
i
could
get
a
case
of
bud
and
have
change
in
my
pocket
for
the
price
of
two
sixers
of
stella
pours
out
to
a
light
golden
color
in
the
glass
with
an
average
sized
head
aroma
is
rather
grassy
with
a
slight
citrus
in
the
background
albeit
light
the
taste
is
very
euro
lager
tasting
with
an
initial
creaminess
that
belies
a
slight
sweetness
that
finishes
with
a
dose
of
light
hops
hoppier
than
americancanadian
lagers
nothing
outstanding
but
a
decent
thirst
quencher
stale
club
cracker
malt
flavors
up
front
a
little
cardboard
as
well
along
with
some
herbal
sweetness
hops
are
lightly
skunked
but
provide
more
bitterness
than
expected
not
awful
just
very
underwhelming
light
spritzy
mouthfeel
meh
i
think
there
are
possibly
one
or
two
better
beers
from
belgium
drinkability
why
the
aforementioned
tonic
water
is
higher
on
my
list
to
drink
than
this
dreck
glad
it
was
only
a
tasting
i
poured
this
one
on
the
ground
alas
not
a
waste
mouthfeel
was
surprising
crisp
at
the
start
and
finish
based
on
the
flat
appearance
and
had
a
clean
finish
drinkability
is
fine
but
overall
this
brew
is
slightly
dull
this
one
always
reminded
me
of
the
bad
euro
lagers
i
had
when
studying
for
a
semester
in
italy
back
in
college
on
draft
its
just
as
good
as
a
dinkle
acker
or
a
pilsner
urquell
easy
enough
to
drink
but
i
feel
theyll
always
be
better
options
for
the
same
price
no
really
strong
flavour
mild
sweetness
and
some
hop
in
the
finish
body
is
fuller
then
many
lagers
and
the
carbonation
is
what
you
expect
drinkability
is
about
average
notes
i
bought
this
because
i
knew
it
was
belgian
thinking
this
way
i
expected
a
lot
more
now
i
know
that
this
is
swill
for
belgians
so
i
feel
a
little
better
maybe
even
jealous
im
looking
forward
to
better
belgian
beer
like
the
chimay
im
saving
for
a
special
occasion
one
of
the
better
lagers
ive
had
id
love
to
have
a
12pack
of
this
on
a
hot
summers
day
i
find
this
ones
much
better
on
tap
than
from
the
bottle
although
certainly
still
drinkable
in
its
bottled
form
i
certainly
think
this
is
one
of
the
best
if
not
the
best
widely
available
euro
lagers
drinkability
is
this
beers
reason
to
be
here
and
it
does
not
dissapoint
got
the
500ml
can
with
the
glass
gift
set
funny
that
the
glass
cant
hold
all
the
beer
from
the
can
still
happy
with
the
glass
though
really
i
cant
understand
who
couldnt
subjectively
appreciate
this
beer
it
is
in
my
oppinion
the
ultimate
pale
euro
lager
not
to
be
confused
with
other
belgians
in
different
catagories
but
to
be
compared
with
other
dutch
german
czech
etc
type
pilsnerhellesdortmund
style
lagers
i
beleive
this
to
be
a
fantastic
euro
brew
recommend
this
to
many
pale
clear
in
color
a
slight
grassy
taste
followed
by
a
mild
malt
sweetness
and
finally
a
bit
of
hops
shine
through
for
the
proper
aftertaste
becks
who
grolsh
huh
whats
heineken
im
not
sure
as
i
have
no
need
for
them
now
sinkability

i
couldnt
finish
this
one
if
my
life
depended
on
it
drinkability
ok
if
only
one
in
an
once
two
bottles
max
it
is
really
not
a
beer
to
get
loaded
with
i
thought
that
this
was
an
easy
to
drink
beer
more
like
a
europils
than
a
standard
eurolager
i
found
it
interesting
that
my
first
bottle
was
relatively
free
of
skunk
some
light
notes
of
it
but
another
bottle
in
the
6pack
which
my
brother
had
reeked
of
it
the
minute
he
popped
the
cap
ive
had
two
more
bottles
out
of
the
6pack
since
and
no
skunk
was
encountered
it
seems
that
this
beer
can
really
change
depending
on
whether
or
not
its
lightstruck
to
finish
this
beer
is
really
not
what
belgian
beer
is
about
but
it
is
decent
enough
to
give
it
a
try
right
off
the
pour
i
can
tell
this
is
going
to
be
green
bottle
brew
at
its
finest
clear
pale
straw
color
pretty
nice
white
head
on
the
top
nice
lacing
as
well
green
bottle
scent
sweet
malt
light
malt
in
the
front
some
bitter
hops
fairly
thin
mouth
i
guess
you
get
what
you
expect
from
this
standard
euro
lager
drinkabilty
actually
this
is
a
good
sessions
beer
but
thats
about
it
drinkability
poor
doesnt
quench
your
thirst
and
not
a
very
good
flavor
i
honestly
had
some
difficulty
finishing
it
a
pretty
unappealing
eurolager
poured
this
beer
into
a
pint
glass
it
pours
a
nice
golden
color
there
is
a
nice
constant
12
inch
head
the
smell
i
get
good
hops
and
balancing
maltiness
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
better
than
average
the
mouthfeel
has
a
slightly
creamier
mouthfeel
than
most
lager
i
am
use
to
this
is
a
beer
i
could
sit
down
and
consume
mass
quantities
if
i
was
in
a
situation
to
do
so
i
drink
stella
periodically
but
this
time
it
tastes
really
average
it
is
upsetting
that
a
lager
with
a
650year
heritage
has
dwindled
into
mediocrity
over
the
course
of
mere
decades
due
to
its
change
from
a
beer
at
the
forefront
of
western
european
lager
to
one
aimed
at
the
masses
with
money
in
mind
it
is
still
definitely
potable
but
it
has
lost
its
je
ne
sais
quoi
that
made
the
beer
as
popular
as
it
has
become
cheaper
beers
that
do
the
same
job
can
be
found
in
particular
in
australia
with
the
dutch
lager
hollandia
a
lager
from
belgium
and
a
relatively
good
one
too
pours
a
clear
golden
with
a
foamy
white
head
with
tons
of
lace
and
effervescence
smell
was
saaz
hops
and
not
much
else
akin
to
a
pilsener
but
a
little
funkier
taste
is
some
malts
up
front
with
a
pleasant
liggering
hoppy
finish
mouthfeel
was
quite
crisp
and
light
this
goes
great
with
seafood
and
although
there
are
many
belgian
beers
that
make
this
look
like
a
glass
of
fizzy
golden
water
i
still
enjoy
this
very
much
again
im
not
a
lager
fan
this
lager
is
exceptional
in
that
it
tastes
clean
its
is
not
overly
hopped
and
it
is
not
watered
down
a
good
strong
taste
nice
sparkling
gold
colour
an
overall
solid
beer
slightly
above
average
i
wouldnt
buy
this
for
myself
but
i
would
accept
it
if
offered
had
this
one
at
a
bar
in
atlanta
called
randevous
i
expected
to
get
it
in
a
pint
glass
but
to
my
suprise
they
put
it
in
an
actual
stella
glass
thanks
to
them
i
have
another
glass
for
my
collection
hehehe
anyways
not
too
impressive
of
a
beer
just
like
a
light
euro
lager
pretty
much
thin
taste
light
color
and
nice
head
to
it
the
head
retention
was
impressive
but
that
was
the
only
good
thing
about
this
beer
really
oh
and
ofcourse
it
was
friggin
expensive
as
well
drinkability
i
wouldnt
seek
this
out
again
but
i
would
take
it
over
other
lagers
would
prefer
something
else
though
poured
a
pale
straw
colour
with
a
nice
foamy
head
better
than
average
lacing
quite
impressive
other
than
how
it
looked
it
was
just
another
average
euro
lager
taste
was
crisp
and
clean
good
amount
of
hop
bitterness
light
malt
but
not
much
else
way
too
over
hyped
its
kinda
like
the
beer
for
pretenders
at
beer
bars
who
think
theyre
drinking
the
premium
stuff
but
arent
really
drinkability
is
high
good
easy
drinking
lager
that
is
better
than
a
lot
of
the
eurolagers
ive
had
very
smooth
and
no
unpleasant
tastes
in
here
based
on
what
i
have
come
to
know
and
expect
of
beers
from
belgium
about
the
only
thing
this
beer
has
in
common
is
geography
really
did
not
strike
me
as
a
euro
lager
and
seemed
more
in
line
with
some
lagers
produced
in
canada
and
even
then
not
one
of
the
better
ones
somewhat
thin
with
a
grapey
note
to
the
hops
perhaps
this
was
a
better
beer
in
the
past
before
becoming
megaopolized
but
right
now
it
hits
the
lower
side
of
average
on
my
scale
i
see
so
many
people
order
this
beer
where
i
work
and
i
have
no
idea
why
they
would
ever
chose
it
advertising
uneducated
scalded
taste
buds
i
dont
know
but
i
dont
feel
the
need
to
ever
drink
this
beer
again
this
beer
is
overrated
by
most
regular
beer
drinkers
but
undervalued
by
the
beer
snobs
it
is
quite
drinkable
with
a
pleasant
hoppy
nose
i
prefer
it
over
heineken
and
becks
and
most
definetely
over
canadian
not
a
great
beer
but
not
the
crap
some
would
have
you
believe
poured
out
of
the
can
into
the
stella
artois
glass
that
came
with
the
can
its
a
nice
glass
anyways
the
head
is
rather
small
goes
up
to
about
34
of
a
finger
and
disipates
to
maybe
14
of
a
finger
after
about
7
minutes
though
a
pale
yellow
its
not
transparent
i
put
my
fingers
on
the
other
side
of
the
glass
and
all
i
see
are
the
shadows
hazy
as
well
as
if
their
is
a
bit
of
a
thick
cloud
inside
the
glass
lace
sticks
magnificently
well
smells
like
a
typical
pilzner
bit
of
cracked
corn
grain
husks
and
saaz
hops
lightly
skunky
but
i
think
thats
how
it
is
supposed
to
be
tastes
incredibly
malty
the
first
sip
makes
me
crave
a
sandwich
on
pumpernickel
and
at
the
moment
it
hits
the
spot
aftertaste
is
slightly
grassy
not
very
bitter
but
grassy
smooth
full
bodies
mouthfeel
not
heavy
but
above
medium
certainly
a
drinkable
lager
and
definitely
a
session
beer
pours
a
nice
pale
yellow
with
a
nice
creamy
white
head
the
smell
is
of
grains
and
lemon
zest
the
taste
is
smooth
and
clean
hints
of
spice
and
citrus
zest
with
a
floral
hop
grains
balance
out
the
beer
very
clean
goes
great
with
clams
or
other
seafood
light
and
great
on
tap
wow
this
is
one
average
ass
beer
looks
like
your
typical
massproduced
belgium
lager
with
hardly
any
head
or
lacing
smells
like
sour
malts
and
a
bit
of
unfresh
hops
tastes
a
little
above
average
but
not
enough
ot
make
it
anything
special
once
i
got
down
to
the
bottom
i
could
definitly
taste
the
green
i
was
really
dissapointed
by
the
mouthfeel
felt
like
i
was
drinking
a
warm
flat
sprite
on
a
cold
winters
day
and
finally
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
if
you
can
stand
it
all
in
all
an
average
ass
beer
an
average
beer
to
me
clear
yellow
body
small
head
tops
it
off
classic
crisp
pils
hop
aroma
mild
beginning
to
the
taste
with
the
standard
pils
hop
finish
pils
is
not
my
favorite
style
but
i
can
appreciate
it
light
carbonation
mouth
feel
crisp
finish
and
no
after
taste
guess
what
this
is
a
typical
euro
lager
but
it
seems
to
be
a
few
times
better
than
heineken
smell
is
crisp
and
dry
hops
and
grain
head
is
a
little
creamy
and
sticks
to
the
sides
taste
is
clean
crisp
some
hops
going
on
not
to
well
balanced
if
you
are
going
to
drink
a
euro
lager
you
might
as
well
drink
this
one
unerrated
this
is
a
fine
brew
crystal
clear
firmsturdy
head
that
lingered
smell
was
forcefully
hoppy
taste
followed
suit
will
a
nice
malt
sweetness
and
a
somewhat
smoky
hop
whack
really
good
competes
well
with
the
finest
pilsners
this
beer
is
too
hip
to
score
well
with
bas
too
bad
overall
this
is
one
of
the
better
mainstream
eurolagers
this
is
a
clean
refreshing
and
flavorful
lager
great
for
hot
weather
drinking
rating
it
again
because
the
can
was
about
as
good
as
the
bottle
so
if
youa
re
stuck
at
least
you
will
get
a
mediocre
ok
interbrew
thats
not
metallic
tasting
had
a
pint
on
the
patio
at
end
of
a
hot
afternoon
and
could
cope
malt
lager
that
is
pale
and
on
bitter
side
500ml
can
with
best
before
date
stamped
on
the
bottom
clear
pale
piss
yellow
not
golden
just
a
blah
kind
of
macro
light
yellow
thin
white
head
with
a
little
stickiness
to
it
slight
maltiness
grassy
hops
and
a
little
of
that
green
bottle
skunk
on
the
nose
dry
feel
in
the
mouth
a
little
spicy
a
little
more
of
that
skunk
pretty
bland
flavor
mouthfeel
is
a
little
low
on
co2
body
about
medium
this
ones
average
at
best
i
really
cant
tell
if
there
is
anything
truly
destinctive
about
this
euro
macro
lager
its
like
so
many
others
in
shared
character
if
i
was
pressed
for
aa
answer
i
would
say
the
malt
body
is
a
tad
heavier
than
most
macro
light
lagers
and
the
hop
delivery
is
late
perhaps
over
stated
and
bites
too
hard
in
the
finish
leaving
the
tongue
very
dry
poured
a
light
gold
with
a
smallish
white
cap
that
dissipated
quickly
aromas
of
boiled
grian
hulls
with
slight
sweetness
and
a
mild
floral
tone
from
the
long
boil
of
the
hops
very
carbonated
slightly
thin
in
the
upfront
mouth
feel
then
mellows
a
bit
as
the
malt
sweetness
and
bready
taste
is
departed
then
the
finish
is
crashingly
dry
not
bad
but
hyped
too
much
a
standard
euromacro
lager
the
type
of
thing
you
would
expect
to
see
shamelessly
marketed
in
cans
not
awful
but
not
great
a
big
seller
over
here
even
though
theres
soooo
much
better
out
there
not
what
id
expect
from
a
belgian
beer
very
bland
and
nondescript
a
belgian
macro
its
really
not
that
bad
of
a
beer
it
actually
tastes
more
like
a
german
pilsner
with
some
belgian
overtones
of
course
isnt
that
what
a
lot
of
belgians
are
like
anyway
its
not
to
bad
id
take
it
over
bud
any
day
whats
up
with
the
hype
behind
this
brew
looks
like
dishwater
runoff
and
doesnt
taste
any
better
had
it
on
tap
at
the
irish
pub
atlantic
city
it
did
come
in
a
cool
goblet
that
i
took
the
liberty
of
keeping
save
your
money
and
have
a
coke
i
wouldnt
drink
this
stuff
it
was
free
as
an
aside
i
really
have
to
hand
it
to
them
for
those
commercials
on
english
tv
that
are
in
french
with
no
subtitles
makes
them
seem
really
artsy
except
to
people
who
can
actually
speak
french
like
myself
uggh
gave
a
try
after
a
buddy
with
decent
taste
offered
wont
ever
drink
again
very
bland
and
boring
nothing
unique
average
by
the
end
of
the
bottle
it
just
tasted
like
overly
carbonated
water
with
a
weird
taste
that
i
couldnt
place
definitely
not
hops
or
malt
i
dont
like
to
be
able
to
see
through
my
beer
maybe
if
it
wasnt
so
carbonated
it
wouldnt
be
half
bad
nope
tap
poured
a
golden
colored
beer
with
a
nice
foamy
white
head
aroma
is
mostly
light
floral
with
some
malt
taste
is
very
light
and
refreshing
with
again
some
malt
and
floral
aspect
coming
through
medium
carbonation
with
light
body
very
little
else
to
mention
for
this
beer
apart
from
the
fact
that
it
seems
to
be
better
on
tap
then
in
bottle
overall
a
refreshing
sessiontype
lager
the
sharp
impacting
carbonation
felt
in
the
mouth
and
throatwhich
then
disappearsadds
a
nice
element
of
uniqueness
i
find
to
this
beerand
also
makes
it
quite
drinkable
excellent
with
a
meal
medium
body
adds
some
umph
a
good
mediocre
beer
with
some
character
of
its
own
this
is
the
budweiser
of
belgium
okay
that
might
be
a
little
harsh
to
be
honest
i
would
only
go
as
far
as
calling
this
average
in
every
way
it
reminds
me
very
much
of
molson
canadian
its
more
malty
than
anything
there
was
a
mild
floral
scent
and
taste
along
with
the
malty
sweetness
of
it
but
that
was
about
it
im
not
impressed
but
not
totally
disappointed
by
it
i
dont
think
the
price
was
fair
5
00
for
a
pint
i
should
have
stuck
with
something
better
for
3
50
a
pint
thats
what
killed
the
drinkability
factor
its
definitely
easy
to
drink
poured
out
a
pale
gold
color
with
a
decent
head
on
it
some
hop
aroma
in
there
but
it
was
mostly
a
clean
smell
to
this
beer
this
was
a
light
mixture
of
some
malts
and
hops
they
were
balanced
quite
well
i
should
add
but
it
was
just
a
little
too
light
for
a
pale
lager
if
there
was
a
little
more
flavor
to
it
then
it
would
be
quite
a
decent
beer
granted
this
is
much
better
than
macros
but
the
price
is
quite
hefty
on
for
a
sixer
maybe
ill
revisit
this
one
down
in
the
future
good
enough
easy
to
drink
i
was
disappointed
not
much
body
not
much
soul
not
much
to
look
at
but
very
drinkable
not
filling
or
satisfying
but
does
fill
a
need
for
refreshment
not
much
of
a
lager
fan
but
this
is
something
i
would
go
back
to
and
would
drink
a
lot
of
compared
to
domestic
lagers
save
for
the
price
point
an
easy
drinking
lager
better
than
most
but
nothing
id
run
out
to
buy
pours
yellow
with
a
decent
amount
of
head
not
much
to
the
smell
here
smells
like
a
typical
lager
tastes
good
but
again
pretty
average
the
best
quality
about
this
beer
is
its
drinkability
good
session
beer
overall
an
average
tasting
brew
but
i
would
probably
get
it
again
some
time
as
i
bash
lagers
and
pilsners
quite
a
bit
i
must
say
this
beer
hit
the
b
spot
as
its
like
85
degrees
fahrenheit
today
the
color
on
the
pour
is
a
crystalline
gold
with
a
prosperous
white
head
that
is
also
creamy
in
texture
with
the
lace
a
fine
veil
to
conceal
the
glass
nose
is
prototypical
lager
fresh
and
sweet
nicely
malted
with
the
start
sweet
and
the
top
light
to
moderate
in
feel
finish
has
a
pleasant
acidity
with
the
hops
apropos
to
the
style
quite
dry
aftertaste
and
a
quite
drinkable
lager
that
ive
not
sampled
in
years
a
great
session
beer
for
the
hot
summer
days
in
arizona
that
are
just
around
the
corner
vigorous
pour
left
a
bright
white
1finger
head
that
dissipated
quickly
with
a
small
amount
of
lacing
clear
bright
gold
in
color
with
constant
carbonation
a
faint
malty
aroma
that
i
had
to
strain
to
pick
up
basically
your
standard
mass
produced
lager
well
balanced
in
flavor
with
a
crisp
maltiness
that
hangs
around
dont
expect
too
much
from
this
beer
and
it
wont
disappoint
you
this
a
pale
lager
and
even
a
belgian
pale
lager
can
only
do
so
much
it
is
very
drinkable
i
drank
untold
gallons
of
this
stuff
when
i
lived
in
belgian
but
probably
not
worth
the
premium
price
you
would
pay
for
it
in
the
us
that
said
it
is
much
better
in
my
opinion
than
your
average
american
macros
12
ounce
bottle
best
before
date
of
062004
fresh
i
tried
to
buy
a
single
for
sampling
purposes
but
was
told
that
was
against
the
law
oh
well
light
straw
color
some
sulpher
in
the
nose
and
perhaps
some
cabbbage
very
little
malt
flavor
very
moderate
hopping
fairly
watery
medium
body
not
much
flavor
in
the
finish
i
wouldnt
bother
again
very
hot
day
beer
or
with
a
salad
try
to
find
something
better
to
spend
your
money
on
ill
take
this
over
a
heineken
any
day
and
i
bet
its
much
better
on
tap
than
from
the
green
bottle
i
thought
i
would
give
stella
a
chance
on
tap
figuring
that
it
would
be
better
than
the
bottled
version
i
must
be
missing
something
because
this
has
no
relationship
to
good
belgian
brews
it
doesnt
even
compare
with
massproduced
german
brews
like
becks
or
lowenbrau
it
looks
okay
but
mundane
it
looks
about
like
a
michelob
on
tap
there
is
very
little
head
no
discernible
lacing
and
no
aroma
the
taste
is
also
curiously
subdued
thats
a
nice
word
for
no
taste
it
is
thin
in
the
mouth
but
does
go
down
easy
and
it
was
cheap
on
tap
i
talked
to
the
manager
about
putting
a
good
local
beer
on
tap
in
its
place
very
easy
drinking
stuff
its
typical
european
continental
lager
but
i
dont
have
a
problem
with
that
not
too
different
from
any
of
the
other
dozen
or
so
varieties
we
get
here
in
the
us
but
its
an
enjoyable
pint
when
fresh
much
much
better
than
the
bottle
where
the
carbonation
has
always
been
too
fizzy
for
me
riiight
beer
was
very
soft
and
creamy
and
extremely
easy
to
drink
i
had
several
as
it
was
the
best
beer
the
bar
offered
i
liked
this
beer
more
than
i
thought
i
would
and
i
dont
think
it
deserves
all
the
bashing
it
gets
crystalclear
light
gold
with
a
small
white
head
that
leaves
a
lot
of
lacing
down
the
glass
smell
is
big
but
not
that
great
a
little
too
grainy
and
reminiscent
of
cornmeal
flavor
is
fine
feel
could
be
smoother
with
the
carbonation
a
step
above
most
pale
lagers
but
nothing
too
special
wont
drink
again
certainly
drinkable
no
match
for
a
czech
pilsner
though
drinkability
tastes
like
a
well
crafted
macro
nothing
special
good
but
not
noteworthy
like
i
said
disappointing
especially
for
a
county
that
produces
chimay
and
duvel
etc
pretty
common
stuff
and
hard
to
get
excited
about
one
of
those
lowest
common
denominator
beers
that
doesnt
look
like
much
doesnt
smell
like
much
doesnt
taste
like
much
good
thing
falling
asleep
while
youre
drinking
a
beer
isnt
generally
dangerous
the
taste
is
aboveaverage
when
compared
with
most
macro
eurolagers
it
has
a
nice
crisp
refreshing
hoppiness
and
isnt
sweet
at
all
i
dont
catch
too
much
of
a
corn
or
rice
adjunct
here
which
is
nice
stella
is
clearly
nothing
too
spectacular
but
it
is
more
than
drinkable
i
prefer
this
over
heineken
becks
1664
et
al
my
best
memory
of
this
beer
was
drinking
it
on
the
streets
and
public
transit
of
london
on
tap
at
baileys
smokehouse
in
richmond
the
beer
poured
a
light
gold
color
with
a
white
lace
head
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
clean
and
refreshing
scent
it
smells
of
pale
malts
and
lager
yeast
the
taste
is
rather
good
it
goes
down
smooth
and
easy
its
simple
pale
malts
water
hops
and
yeast
it
also
has
that
skunky
green
bottle
taste
to
it
the
mouthfeel
is
good
it
is
a
low
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
good
lager
id
drink
this
again
and
i
typically
hate
lagers
pale
gold
color
huge
white
head
gigantic
smell
of
grass
clippings
and
grain
has
a
very
mellow
flavor
not
like
a
watered
down
macro
but
it
is
more
subtle
has
a
very
euro
lager
flavor
with
a
nice
balance
of
hops
not
my
favorite
style
you
can
keep
your
euro
lagers
this
beer
poured
with
a
very
large
and
creamy
head
that
lasted
till
the
last
drop
the
color
was
a
very
light
gold
nice
and
clear
and
crisp
looking
the
smell
as
best
i
could
describe
was
a
sweet
skunky
smell
the
taste
was
good
i
have
to
admit
i
was
surprised
it
has
a
very
crisp
taste
a
slight
sweetness
and
a
nice
dryness
to
the
aftertaste
that
i
enjoyed
smell
is
a
touch
malty
and
very
sweet
smelling
the
flavor
is
more
solid
than
i
remembered
even
has
a
nice
hint
of
hops
in
there
i
must
say
that
i
prefer
this
beer
in
the
bottle
over
the
draft
much
more
clean
and
crisp
stella
artois
is
a
nice
looking
beer
and
presents
a
pleasant
frothy
and
creamy
head
with
lots
of
sticky
lace
stella
artois
has
a
strong
aroma
and
may
be
labelled
skunky
by
some
drinkers
a
malty
initial
taste
with
an
extremely
sharp
and
dry
aftertaste
i
wasnt
expecting
stella
artois
to
have
this
much
flavour
drinkability
a
somewhat
better
than
average
lager
would
certainly
pick
it
over
any
american
macro
one
of
the
better
mass
produced
beers
they
are
taking
advantage
of
this
in
australia
and
charging
a
hell
of
alot
for
it
and
suckers
like
me
fall
for
it
because
there
are
no
better
options
at
some
bars
beer
wise
that
is
theres
always
spirits
average
bar
without
many
choices
never
had
it
bar
tender
swore
it
was
great
what
the
hell
pours
yellow
but
not
as
pale
as
macro
american
lagers
dinky
white
bubbly
head
tops
its
off
served
pretty
damn
cold
not
much
of
a
nose
slighty
grainy
and
a
bit
floral
is
all
i
can
pull
off
it
taste
wise
pretty
close
to
the
standard
import
lager
save
the
few
greats
lighty
grainy
semi
sweet
wth
a
light
clean
hop
twang
crisp
and
well
carbonated
its
a
plain
lager
nothing
more
nothing
less
the
fact
that
the
look
is
the
high
point
of
this
beer
does
not
bode
well
you
can
drink
as
many
of
these
as
youd
like
but
why
would
you
its
not
vile
i
dont
want
to
imply
that
but
i
had
one
and
immediately
switched
to
yuengling
at
half
the
price
and
believe
in
my
heart
of
hearts
that
id
be
getting
the
best
deal
even
if
the
lager
were
the
more
expensive
beer
they
say
it
sells
well
to
the
ladies
but
i
dont
want
to
believe
the
fairer
sex
has
been
duped
so
utterly
apparently
stella
is
belgian
for
medicore
at
best
unfortunately
belgiums
most
popular
beer
is
not
thier
best
example
if
i
were
recommending
a
nice
starter
belgium
i
would
say
try
a
witkap
pater
single5abv
leffe
blonde
5abv
or
valdue
blonde
6abv
there
are
better
belgian
lagers
but
even
so
for
whats
available
in
my
neck
of
the
woods
this
is
a
goer
stella
has
saved
my
bacon
on
a
potentially
dismal
drinking
night
on
many
occaisions
having
said
that
ive
never
bought
a
six
pack
of
this
in
my
life
i
reserve
it
strictly
for
emergencies
char
i
have
no
idea
why
they
waste
good
belgian
water
to
produce
this
kind
of
lager
not
that
its
bad
but
its
just
another
european
lager
better
suited
to
a
summer
afternoon
than
a
november
evening
like
tonight
not
much
color
or
head
but
a
decent
hop
aroma
the
flavor
is
good
but
many
others
brew
this
kind
of
beer
better
put
this
at
the
bottom
of
belgian
beers
to
try
unless
you
are
a
big
fan
of
european
lagers
pilsners
the
czech
stella
served
in
a
somewhat
large
66
liter
bottle
appears
golden
yellow
with
head
approaching
0
towards
the
end
smells
like
not
much
at
all
slight
hoppy
smell
taste
is
bland
a
little
hoppy
and
consistent
there
are
better
lagers
to
be
found
my
friends
ah
the
even
crappier
russian
version
of
stella
i
ordered
this
at
an
excellent
chinese
restaurant
in
moscow
it
came
out
in
a
nice
logo
stemware
glass
and
didnt
look
half
bad
slightly
greenish
gold
sits
under
a
onefinger
white
head
that
settled
quickly
forget
about
lace
the
nose
was
malty
grainy
ricey
and
slightly
skunked
the
mouth
was
a
bit
prickly
and
fairly
heavy
with
a
bready
consistency
the
taste
features
mild
bitterness
from
the
start
with
musty
malt
undertones
and
a
touch
of
cabbage
the
finish
is
vegetable
and
hoppy
bitter
while
the
aftertaste
has
a
crisp
bitterness
with
ricey
notes
could
i
drink
a
ton
of
these
sure
would
i
want
to
not
really
ah
the
crappy
uk
version
of
stella
drunk
from
a
can
whilst
watching
blaine
greet
his
army
of
fans
this
is
watery
with
no
real
aroma
of
hops
or
malt
the
taste
is
the
same
it
tastes
of
something
but
what
i
dont
know
mouthfeel
is
light
and
drinkability
is
ok
average
i
anticipated
liking
this
less
in
fact
my
first
try
was
from
a
sample
bottle
provided
free
wasnt
moved
even
disliked
it
at
first
but
it
grew
on
me
on
tap
as
you
can
tell
from
other
reviews
its
quite
a
nice
simple
thirstquenching
quaffable
pils
i
can
easily
understand
its
popularity
theres
just
enough
flavor
to
make
this
well
worth
drinking
and
not
be
just
another
pizza
chaser
slight
musky
funk
and
seeds
some
slight
cardboard
to
the
rather
ordinary
sweet
malt
really
light
hints
of
alcohol
this
is
a
good
beer
i
would
not
buy
it
for
a
special
occasion
and
i
probably
would
never
have
it
when
i
go
out
to
a
bar
but
if
i
had
access
to
it
just
a
little
skunk
taste
is
very
light
and
the
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
refreshing
fairly
balanced
between
hops
and
malts
miller
and
youll
see
why
this
beer
is
so
popular
there
recommended
highly
for
those
who
like
the
style

5overall
it
had
better
be
god
damn
good
which
couldnt
have
been
from
the
store
since
columbus
just
got
this
stuff
in
a
few
weeks
ago
a
medium
amount
of
carbonation
was
present
the
flavor
was
of
hops
and
grain
for
a
lager
followed
by
a
dry
bitterness
horrible
the
taste
was
just
a
hint
better
than
the
smell
i
did
mar
20
2003
then
again
maybe
im
being
too
hard
on
it
because
i
tried
it
after
a
long
day
of
tasting
many
flavorful
belgian
ales
and
a
supertasty
special
ipa
from
bjs
its
a
little
hoppy
and
slightly
dry
not
a
whole
lot
going
on
inside
but
this
is
a
pretty
beer
has
a
very
nice
head
and
a
clean
clear
golden
color
continental
hop
aroma
and
expectedly
bitter
not
much
beyond
that
however
average
drinkability
middle
of
the
road
and
probably
not
worth
the
price
the
taste
was
average
a
bit
dry
and
hoppy
reminiscent
of
a
becks
it
left
a
bit
of
a
bitter
aftertaste
on
the
palette
probably
not
something
i
would
try
again
my
favorite
foofoo
bar
added
this
to
their
tap
selection
it
poured
a
nice
amber
color
but
any
hints
of
greatness
or
originality
were
not
present
just
an
average
beer
with
an
unusual
name
taste
on
the
bland
side
the
carbonation
keeping
it
going
it
did
go
good
with
food
however
the
taste
again
was
not
bad
as
is
the
mouthfeel
and
drinkablity
the
smell
makes
it
hard
to
make
this
anything
but
an
average
beer
wheres
the
beef
just
another
boring
import
in
a
green
bottle
this
is
skunk
water
light
carbonation
extralight
bitterness
yet
very
floral
aroma
fighting
through
the
skunk
why
but
beer
in
a
green
bottle
just
another
marketing
scam
why
so
much
hype
reassuringly
expensive
it
is
in
a
green
bottle
a
yuppie
magent
and
the
contents
confirm
my
belief
that
no
self
respecing
brewer
buts
his
brew
in
a
green
bottle
a
quite
undrinkable
beer
that
i
will
avoid
in
the
future
pours
in
a
nice
golden
color
with
a
big
foamy
head
it
looks
really
clear
and
tasty
smells
hoppy
nothing
more
nothing
less
the
taste
doesnt
really
appeal
to
me
just
a
malty
and
bready
taste
of
course
its
drinkable
but
nothing
fancy
tasting
here
over
all
its
a
decent
pils
with
plus
for
the
looks
but
since
when
do
you
only
look
on
beer
o
on
draught
at
the
uva
cafe
in
downtown
disney
this
beer
really
did
not
impress
me
on
any
level
the
first
thing
i
noticed
on
the
tap
was
that
this
was
from
belgium
so
i
guess
i
was
expecting
a
belgian
ale
but
this
is
very
obviously
a
pils
and
an
uninspiring
one
at
that
pours
an
offputting
yellow
with
a
thin
white
head
light
hops
aroma
bland
flavor
that
did
nothing
for
me
at
least
it
wasnt
skunky
the
price
of
this
stuff
doesnt
warrant
buying
it
again
if
im
in
the
mood
for
this
style
ill
gladly
grab
a
warsteiner
or
even
a
cheap
bomber
of
becks
stella
is
all
pretense
and
no
delivery
the
flavor
is
a
little
bitter
with
good
light
malts
and
a
nice
hop
character
drinkability
is
outstanding
it
is
very
crisp
and
you
can
stick
with
this
one
all
night
and
maybe
longer
not
bad
at
all
and
the
best
above
average
of
the
regular
keg
lagers
available
in
the
uk
on
tap
for
me
this
beer
is
made
from
pale
malted
barley
some
say
corn
mixed
in
as
well
and
hopped
with
saaz
hops
when
poured
the
golden
champaigncolored
liquid
produces
a
moderate
amount
of
foam
that
dissipates
quickly
in
a
matter
of
minutes
the
beer
is
mild
tasting
almost
unremarkable
but
with
a
slightly
bitter
finish
that
lingers
seconds
afterwards
a
pronounced
but
not
cloying
sweetness
can
be
tasted
long
after
all
the
bitterness
disappears
the
beer
is
quite
refreshing
when
drunk
cold
and
mildly
acceptable
when
warm
it
has
a
5
2
alcohol
content
better
than
budweiser
but
there
are
better
choices
available
than
stella
a
nice
thick
foamy
head
which
complements
the
golden
color
the
smell
is
very
reminiscent
of
a
heineken
or
any
other
european
lager
whats
great
about
this
beer
is
cold
crisp
refreshing
the
aftertaste
a
little
bitter
but
overall
the
taste
is
refreshing
and
smooth
when
it
comes
down
to
this
beer
is
nothing
complex
but
i
knew
that
coming
into
the
tasting
this
beer
is
sometimes
referred
to
as
belgiums
budweiser
and
all
i
can
say
if
this
is
bud
why
cant
i
be
from
belgium
i
could
get
used
to
this
lager
in
a
big
hurry
such
a
smooth
brew
going
down
leaning
ever
so
slightly
towards
a
mild
hoppy
bitterness
that
pleases
the
palate
the
colour
is
that
of
medium
gold
with
a
lace
that
attacks
the
entire
glass
a
beer
for
all
occasions
had
a
nice
taste
but
a
little
to
sour
for
me
almost
winey
nice
head
good
body
outstanding
color
after
this
one
ii
was
not
refreshed
i
was
expecting
so
much
moore
i
love
to
drink
this
beer
draught
specially
with
2
fingers
of
foam
its
just
great
very
nice
gold
appearance
sparkling
and
nice
smell
quite
good
taste
but
not
very
strong
and
it
can
be
drank
anytime
of
the
day
green
bottle
with
a
light
golden
color
and
little
to
no
white
foam
color
and
aroma
was
the
highlight
of
this
average
to
below
average
beer
there
was
no
outstanding
flavor
and
the
finish
was
just
not
there
what
a
let
down
i
still
really
havent
found
a
good
beer
in
a
white
green
or
light
colored
bottle
ive
now
tried
this
beer
three
times
and
still
impressed
clear
golden
little
carbonation
sticks
to
the
sides
well
mild
malty
smell
im
not
a
fan
of
this
type
but
enjoyed
this
mildly
hopped
taste
mouthfeel
is
full
and
heavily
carbonated
very
drinkable
but
since
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
this
style
not
one
that
i
will
go
back
to
most
likely
all
you
could
want
in
a
pilsner
appearancewise
solid
gold
lacy
white
head
that
sticks
around
just
beautiful
nose
is
appropriately
hoppy
and
grassy
with
a
very
nice
bisquity
malt
note
dissappoints
somewhat
on
the
palate
sort
of
ponderous
and
clumsy
with
the
malt
and
hops
remaining
distinct
flavors
rather
than
uniting
to
make
a
beer
becomes
a
bit
thick
on
the
palate
ultimately
its
a
nice
pilsner
but
not
one
id
actively
seek
out
golden
color
with
a
nice
white
head
and
good
lace
also
has
great
clarity
smells
clean
with
some
grain
aroma
light
and
crisp
but
not
dry
sort
of
reminds
me
of
heineken
but
much
better
and
not
skunky
finishes
with
some
hop
and
a
lingering
taste
very
easy
to
drink
a
nice
lager
hoppy
for
a
blonde
as
opposed
to
a
pilsener
crisp
with
a
very
nice
finish
apparently
on
of
the
beers
of
summer
2002
and
rightfully
so
i
have
little
desire
to
drink
it
in
the
dead
of
winter
but
its
lovely
on
the
patio
very
consistent
in
quality
and
a
beer
popular
with
my
regular
beer
friends
clear
golden
color
decent
white
head
noticable
sour
beer
smell
taste
was
noticably
hop
heavy
but
again
a
definite
lingering
sour
finish
harsh
aftertaste
as
well
lacks
the
the
crisp
clean
finish
of
some
other
pilseners
or
lagers
worth
a
try
on
tap
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
again
to
order
it
although
it
better
than
some
others
like
heineken
crystal
clear
and
golden
in
color
the
head
is
a
tight

534had
this
one
in
canada
on
billboards
i
thought
it
would
be
the
budweiser
of
england
a
good
regular
beer
holds
a
solid
head
carbonated
just
right
feels
good
going
down
a
bit
skunky
a
tad
sweet
and
a
hint
of
cherry
dont
know
why
the
only
thing
that
i
dont
like
about
stella
is
the
aroma
almost
smells
like
its
skunked
but
once
you
get
by
that
you
will
enjoy
one
of
the
best
lagers
the
head
is
like
whipped
cream
and
clings
to
the
glass
all
the
way
to
the
bottom
great
golden
color
and
a
wonderful
taste
clearly
makes
this
a
classic
stella
is
so
very
tasty
a
bit
more
flavorful
than
most
american
pilsners
stella
is
a
nice
light
beer
that
is
good
for
all
occasions
with
almost
any
food
i
may
be
overly
critical
of
pilsners
but
i
tend
to
like
them
less
than
a
lot
of
other
styles
that
being
said
stella
artois
is
not
a
bad
pilsner
maybe
because
its
made
in
belgium
not
as
hoppy
as
a
lot
of
the
pilsners
ive
had
but
not
too
few
hops
i
did
notice
that
the
beer
got
blander
and
blander
the
closer
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
i
got
i
actually
spent
most
of
the
glass
thinking
what
the
hell
is
wrong
with
this
beer
i
thought
i
had
ordered
a
troubador
blonde
but
forgot
they
were
out
and
i
had
settled
for
stella
11
2
oz
bottle
it
is
what
you
wanted
beer
to
taste
like
when
you
were
16
if
i
had
taste
when
i
was
16
years
old
quite
drinkable
great
with
pizza
or
burgers
but
nothing
special
jumps
out
enough
to
make
a
huge
impact
on
your
tougue
but
a
solid
choice
in
a
limited
bar
ive
finally
had
it
in
the
bottle
light
refreshing
pils
style
head
and
shoulders
better
than
beckshenie
et
al
as
it
did
not
have
that
skunked
out
taste
it
is
clean
somewhat
fruity
yet
still
barely
keeps
itself
above
the
run
of
the
mill
euro
lagers
such
as
heineken
becks
etc
a
great
lager
so
easy
to
drink
but
has
a
nice
character
and
round
flavour
bit
pricey
in
some
places
for
what
you
get
but
still
nice
average
beer
no
better
no
worse
had
it
on
tap
last
night
and
cant
for
the
life
of
me
remember
anything
that
made
it
stand
out
from
any
other
massproduced
pils
im
not
a
big
lager
fan
in
general
but
there
are
a
few
that
i
do
like
to
consume
from
time
to
time
this
one
just
got
added
to
that
list
not
the
greatest
beer
in
the
world
but
it
is
definitely
very
drinkable
and
would
be
very
refreshing
on
a
hot
summer
day
disappointing
for
a
belgium
strong
hoppy
smell
they
have
been
brewing
it
since
1366
330ml
bottle
typical
skunked
green
bottle
pilsner
i
think
all
others
heine
becks
st
paulie
you
name
it
are
more
drinkable
not
all
that
impressed
i
had
it
with
thai
food
and
it
went
well
but
seemed
to
be
lacking
something
nice
balance
some
citrus
and
light
malt
flavor
but
nothing
more
i
would
not
go
out
of
my
way
to
drink
this
again
good
stuff
not
to
expensive
and
tastes
a
heck
of
a
lot
better
than
a
lot
of
crap
some
people
put
out
it
doesnt
get
any
slick
advertising
and
marketing
here
but
its
a
much
better
alternative
to
a
great
many
beers
that
do
a
very
fine
beer
i
consumed
huge
amounts
of
this
beer
back
and
forth
to
belgium
on
sabena
it
did
me
just
fine
nothing
special
just
an
other
euro
lager
sadly
this
one
is
trying
to
ride
the
belgain
bandwagon
and
it
does
not
even
stand
up
to
what
really
comes
out
of
belgium
an
adequate
lager
for
the
masses
im
not
sure
what
the
hype
is
about
this
beer
isnt
bad
but
its
not
worth
what
you
pay
for
it
unfortunately
it
seems
that
this
beer
is
slowly
suffering
from
the
hand
of
interbrew
well
see
where
it
goes
probably
to
shit
an
acquaintance
brought
this
over
he
didnt
know
any
better
not
a
lot
going
on
but
it
was
drinkable
didnt
check
label
for
freshness
six
months
past
drink
by
date
it
had
an
aged
apple
thing
going
on
sweet
malts
and
a
bit
of
hops
still
shone
through
i
like
it
will
try
a
fresher
bottle
in
the
future
and
update
this
tenuous
post
overall
nothing
special
here
overall
the
carbonation
is
a
bit
too
high
as
well
as
the
malt
sweetness
turns
out
to
be
too
onedimensional
at
the
end
500
ml
bottle
poured
into
a
pilsner
glass
pours
a
transparent
straw
color
with
virtually
no
head
to
speak
of
slight
metallic
scent
with
tastes
of
sweet
malt
and
grains
better
on
draught
than
in
bottles
o
this
one
goes
down
very
easy
and
i
am
now
a
fan
of
this
i
would
probably
not
drink
this
regularly
at
home
in
ireland
but
in
the
summer
or
when
in
southern
europe
if
this
is
around
i
would
be
very
happy
to
order
it
and
even
happier
to
drink
it
75100
the
alcohol
was
where
i
expected
it
to
be
and
there
wasnt
a
point
where
i
could
feel
it
in
the
taste
this
was
much
better
than
other
examples
of
the
style
that
ive
had
and
should
i
find
it
again
id
give
it
another
go
this
will
be
on
my
list
of
guilty
pleasure
beers
like
pabst
blue
ribbon
and
miller
high
life
and
sometimes
its
good
to
have
something
light
thats
also
refreshing
and
enjoyable
for
me
this
certainly
fit
that
bill
golden
hue
with
a
white
foamy
head
not
an
overly
aromatic
beer
very
light
subtle
smells
of
grains
and
grassy
notes
slightly
bitter
taste
with
hints
of
corn
and
wheat
finish
is
crisp
with
little
lingering
polands
favourite
beer
for
me
just
a
tastier
version
of
a
coors
or
budweiser
nothing
special

at

as
i

from

but
those
were
different
days
with
far
less
craft
knowledge
oh
well
it
was
good
to
give
it
one
last
go
harp
has
always
had
a
soft
spot
in
my
heart
it
is
reminiscent
of
booze
soaked
trips
to
the
barley
mill
in
calgary
in
the
mid
90s
i
called
the
trip
a
millgramige
because
it
allowed
me
to
literally
soak
in
several
beers
that
werent
available
in
my
hometown
at
that
time
harp
was
then
and
is
now
a
solid
euro
lager
it
lacks
the
skunk
of
many
of
its
green
bottle
brethren
instead
harp
has
a
nice
dry
malthop
character
it
is
eminently
quaffable
and
remains
a
solid
st
pattys
alternative
to
guinness
overall
this
beer
is
not
like
i
remember
from
my
college
days
this
is
an
inoffensive
beer
but
nothing
special
it
is
better
in
a
black
and
tan
so
i
would
probably
not
order
this
by
itself
sad
very
sad
i
never
had
it
before
and
i
wish
i
never
did
great
in
a

offset

other

i
would
purchase
before
this
one
good
beer
made
in
ireland
for
export
guinness
stout
is
all
they
drink
in

overall
this
beer
is
what
it
is
its
a
generic
euro
lager
but
not
a
particularly
bad
one
thin
and
drinkable
it
seems
like
a
subpar
attempt
at
a
helles
but
then
again
isnt
that
what
this
style
is
all
about
very
interesting
beer
its
not
awful
but
its
not
super
great
it
just
is
quite
plain

super
drinkable

a
good
lager
representative
of
the
style
in
spades
i
was
expecting
some
irish
weirdness
but
instead
i
got
a
pleasant
beer
that
was
both
drinkable
and
enjoyable
only
gripe
i
have
is
the
piney
citrus
bitter
thats
plaguing
the
drink
it
is
however
reminiscent
of
a
more
pleasurable
ipa
but
since
i
dont
like
ipas
in
general
id
say
remove
that
and
its
bliss
this
was
a
pleasant
experience
very
good
beer
would
certainly
recommend
to
anyone
interested
in
irish
beer
o
basic
in
every
way

thankfully
not
too
undrinkable

overall
i
was
not
expecting
too
much
from
this
brew
and
thats
what
i
got
it
the
best
adjunct
brew
i
have
had
to
date
i
just
did
not
expect
a
corny
taste
in
a

i
buy
this
again

not

some
spotty
lacing
was
seen
with
each
sip
but
settles
back
down
the
sides
of
the

the
aroma
is
of
some
grains
yeast
with
a
hint
of
lemon
the
taste
is
actually
better
than
i
expected
with
the

coming
together
nicely
with
a

a

balanced

down

with
no
bitter

really
liked
this
one

easy

drink
and
refreshing

not
really
anything
special
leftover
from
st
patricks
day
alcohol
is
well
hidden
but
not
one
that
i
will
be
rushing
out
to
get
again

harp
lager
brewed
by
guinness
ltd
pours
out
a
nice
amber
color
this
brew
has
a
small
white
head
like
most
lager
beers
harp
has
a
skunk
smell
and
that
is
about
it
im
no
big
fan
of
the
smell
of
this
brew
the
taste
is
smooth
with
a
little
bit
at
the
end
there
is
nothing
bad
about
this
brew
taste
overall
im
impressed
on
how
smooth
this
beer
is
but
the
smell
is
not
something
to
be
desired
i
may
get
this
brew
again
if
i
have
the
chance
too
im
giving
this
brew
a
3
25
out
of
5
overall
3
25
is
my
rating
for
harp
lager
i
kind
of
thought
it
would
have
more
personality
but
i
enjoyed
trying
this
out
this
would
be
a
refreshing
brew
if
you
wanted
to
cool
down
with
a
euro
pale
lager
i
might
buy
this
again

not

much
and
maybe
a
small
whisper
of
the
lemon
peel
sweet
grains
make
up
most
of
the
palate
and
the
hops

a
gentle
bit
of
sweet
grass
some
tart

weak
lemon
in
the
background
drinks
crisp
and
clean
with
a
bit
of
bite
on
the
tongue
from
carbonation
and
nice
drying
to
the
finish
a
pretty
good
lager
the
hopping
is
nice
i
think
they
could
improve
the
malt
body
of
this
beer
to
give
it
a
cleaner
taste
there
is
a
stale
corn
cardboard
thing
going
on
in
the
finish
that
detracts
from
this
beers
full
potential
overall
its
still
a
decent
drink
i
would
drink
it
again
if
offered
but
i
probably
wont
be
seeking
it
out
d
kind
of
vague
uninspired
pilsner
better
than
heiny
or
a
few
of
the
common
euro
pale
lagers
dont
get
me
wrong
id
reach
for
this
before
byd
or
heiny
but
thats
not
the
same
as
liking
it
overall
a
very
easy
drink
if
not
a
session
clean
a
beer
i
dont
drink
often
but
am
never
ashamed
of
when
i
do
better
than
i
was

this
beer
has
won
numerous

it

give
this
irish

a
look
will
not

certainly
not

lacks

definitely
has
a
sweetness
to
it
very
palatable
to
the
average
drinker
that
all
being
said
there
is
certainly
nothing
that
stands
out
about
it
a
reliable
brew
for
a

12
oz
bottle
this
at
one
time
was
a
top
favorite
of
mine
when
i
could
find
it
on
tap
has
the
taste
changed
a
little
since
it
has
been
brewed
in
canada
this
bottle
of
beer
has
a
taste
that
is
very
agreeable
and
i
am
glad
i
picked
up
a
case
apparently
brewed
in
canada
now
so
the
label
doesnt
lie
when
it
still
reads
imported
i
also
still
enjoy
a
harp
lager
from
time
to
time
a
little
more
hearty
than
some
of
the
american
lagers
and
certainly
more
flavorful
than
the
bmc
stuff
it
pours
a
glazed
copper
tinted
color
darker
than
convention
with
a
short
lived
white
head
the
nose
is
pale
euro
malts
all
the
way
not
sweet
but
dry
a
little
adjunct
metallic
hint
but
nothing
offensive
at
all
the
taste
is
bready
and
grain
heavy
i
taste
a
number
of
different
malts
hops
no
so
much
this
beer
could
use
a
more
aggressive
finishing
hop
but
thats
just
me
i
like
all
the
malt
heft
without
much
sweetness
a
nice
twist
away
from
the
generic
fuller
body
for
the
style
but
still
easy
drinking
especially
on
a
hot
day
good
carbonation
and
a
flavorful
finish
i
bet
this
is
remarkable
at
the
original
source
and
it
doesnt
travel
too
bad
really
overall
nothing
mind
blowing
but
a
solid
option
if
you
are
looking
for
something
to
enjoy
a
few
of
in
an
evening
may
purchase
this
again
not
a
fan
its
not
terrible
but
the
rating
seems
high
on
this
site
eh
what
could
pull
me
in
off
the
street
to
a
dimly
lit
tavern
on
a
warm
and
sunny
northwest
afternoon
on
a
whim
why
only
the
prospect
of
a
crisp
and
clean
harp
lager
more
body
than
most
lagers
nice
finish
surprised
by
how
welllaced
the
pint
glass
was
solid
brew
o
not
bad
not
great
this
is
a
beer
i
could
see
myself
grabbing
after
mowing
the
lawn
or
with
a
cookout
in
the
summer
but
no
more
so
than
any
other
massproduced
lager
pours
a
pale
yellow
with
a
fluffy
head
bubbles
rising
constantly
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
tells
me
this
is
probably
going
to
be
far
too
carbonated
the
aroma
is
somewhat
that
of
a
typical
american
lager
but
harp
has
a
bready
yeasty
note
that
tells
me
theres
something
more
there
there
is
also
a
floral
aroma
from
the
hops
the
taste
is
slightly
sweet
with
a
faint
bitter
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
definitely
overcarbonated
yet
creamy
with
more
body
and
less
dryness
than
most
beers
of
this
style
youd
expect
a
beer
so
lacking
in
flavor
would
be
thin
and
watery
but
not
so
with
harp
lager
overall
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
theres
just
not
enough
flavor
to
satisfy
my
palate
i
should
note
that
the
flavor
has
become
a
little
stronger
since
its
warmed
but
only
a
little
personally
im
not
one
to
choose
beer
when
im
hot
and
thirsty
theres
water
for
that
but
i
suppose
harp
could
hit
the
spot
on
a
summer
day
certainly
there
are
hundreds
of
worse
choices
overall
pretty
standard
epl
enjoyed
a
bunch
over
the
years
a
fairly
plain
generic
beer
very
similar
to
an
american
adjunct
lager
with
just
a
bit
more
of
a
flavor
profile
prost
lampertland
overall
while
not
a
flavor
powerhouse
the
brew
is
rather
refreshing
it
is
crisp
and
clean
and
very
easy
and
enjoyable
to
drink
o
cant
say
that
pale
euro
lagers
are
my
thing
by
any
means
but
this
one
appears
to
be
done
well
enough
for
the
style
that
said
its
nothing
that
moves
me
in
any
way
just
a
bland
boring
beery
lager
a
bmc
without
the
corn
and
rice
but
any
time
a
pale
lager
is
free
of
adjunct
off
flavors
its
a
bonus
not
remarkable
in
any
way
the
plain
jane
of
beers
should
come
in
the
proverbial
white
can
with
beer
written
on
it
in
big
black
letters
it
makes
a
decent
quaffer
when
added
to
guinness
as
a
halfnhalf
and
it
is
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
never
care
to
drink
this
on
its
own
macrobrew
quality
import
price
cheers
as
expected
this
one
wasnt
a
great
beer
at
all
it
was
drinkable
but
only
just
really
and
not
one
that
i
enjoyed
at
all

very
basic
and
cheap
lager

good
session
beer
with
a
low
alcohol
content
and
very
soft
yet
agreeable
flavor
overall
this
is
a
classic
simple
lager
done
right
very
sessionable
while
it
presents
very
little
to
think
about
its
something
i
could
drink
all
night
while
watching
tv
or
hanging
out
with
friends
another
disappointing
massproduced
beer
that
doesnt
live
up
to
what
youd
hope
for
it
has
a
really
nice
appearance
but
falls
flat
with
any
distinctive
malt
or
hop
character
certainly
drinkable
certainly
mundane
o
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
but
has
a
little
too
much
flavors
of
adjunct
malts
the
taste
was
unexpectedly
bad
much
worse
than
i
thought
it
would
be
o
much
better
than
your
standard
mass
produced
lager
or
ale
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
on
tap
o
a
wee
departure
from
your
standard
macrolager

glad
i
rediscovered
this
beer
its
a
solid
fallwinter
session
beer
and
looking
forward
to
drinking
more
of
it
throughout
the
fallwinter
light
crisp
and
sessionable
however
this
offering
is
only
one
step
above
the
average
aal
the
mouthfeel
is
just
as
much
carbonation
as
necessary
its
dry
enough
to
be
enjoyable
and
makes
you
want
to
take
another
drink
just
average
not
much
else
to
say
harp
is
right
up
my
alley
i
have
accepted
that
i
prefer
lagers
to
all
other
beers
and
harp
has
the
balance
and
taste
that
i
enjoy
not
too
heavy
and
not
too
light
however
it
has
to
come
off
tap
if
youre
really
going
to
enjoy
it
im
in
florida
so
bottles
dont
exactly
hold
up
here
overall
very
solid
anybody
that
hates
mass
produced
corn
beer
should
enjoy
a
harp
overall
a
pretty
average
beer
certainly
better
than
any
macro
lager
but
certainly
nothing
to
go
crazy
over
perfect
for
after
a
long
day
when
you
want
to
take
it
easy
mouthfeel
terrible
beer
just
terrible
very
very
crisp
but
at
the
same
time
very
dry
mouth
feel
i
thought
this
was
an
irish
pale
lager
a
nice
lager
that
seems
to
fluctuate
from
bottletobottle
kegtokeg
this
was
a
very
pleasing
experience
definitely
a
harshly
rough
bittering
hop
character
but
there
are
a
few
other
nuances
to
pull
out
from
the
taste
commendable

this
beer
pours
a
clear
bold
yellow
with
a
thin
head
and
lace
to
the
end
its
aroma
is
of
lemons
and
dough
with
a
hint
of
hay
the
flavor
is
bready
with
malt
sweetness
and
a
note
of
cake
its
very
smooth
and
the
sweetness
is
not
cloying
even
without
a
hop
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
light
harp
lager
is
a
good
beer
a
perfect
match
for
irish
potato
soup
and
bangers
and
mash
recommended
overall
definitely
not
worth
paying
import
costs
for
you
can
get
similar
beers
in
us
for
3350
less
cost
o
a
below
average
lager
from
a
boring
style
to
be
honest
id
take
some
miller
high
life
over
this
any
day
d
highly
drinkable
decently
built
and
affordable
one
of
my
standbys
for
session
beers
no
need
to
have
this
one
again
personally
pours
pale
gold
with
little
evidence
of
carbonation
smell
has
both
hops
and
malt
very
light
kind
of
pearlike
taste
is
very
very
light
very
drinkable
very
refreshing
and
as
ive
just
finished
a
bike
ride
just
what
i
wanted
very
balanced
not
as
macro
light
tasting
as
i
anticipated
im
not
sure
what
that
taste
is
but
then
again
i
am
mouthfeel
is
a
touch
watery
slightly
carbonated
and
generally
not
noticeable
unless
im
reviewing
overall
not
bad
refreshing
when
its
cold
and
youre
hot
i
feel
it
probably
goes
downhill
from
there
12
oz
bottle
pours
clear
straw
color
with
a
white
head
and
sodalike
carbonation
nose
is
of
grassy
hops
and
hey
body
is
medium
and
slightly
crisp
taste
is
barely
noticeable
of
light
hops
and
some
grain
finish
is
very
short
this
brew
is
on
par
with
other
macros
o
i
was
definitely
surprised
by
this
one
more
sweetness
than
i
expected
not
really
any
of
that
adjunct
flavor
and
a
crisp
refreshing
finish
to
it
probably
wouldnt
seek
it
out
but
if
its
around
its
a
nice
light
session
lager
really
liked
this
beer
and
will
definetly
get
some
again
good
gateway
beer
for
stepping
into
imports
if
you
have
never
tried
any
overall
a
pretty
decent
beer
for
the
style
a
step
above
the
other
mass
produced
euro
lagers
d
a
respectable
lager
fairly
quaffable
fairly
sessionable
not
my
first
choice
but
a
tolerable
alternative
to
the
bmc
set
tastes
like
a
typical
lager
too
both
sweet
and
malty
hints
of
caramel
and
certainly
better
than
the
big
boys
lagers
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
either
harp
looks
like
many
other
lagers
a
pale
golden
yellow
to
the
nose
it
brings
the
familiar
smell
of
liquid
bread
it
tastes
clean
and
honestmild
hops
and
subtle
sweetness
from
the
malt
it
is
smooth
on
the
tongue
and
not
too
fizzy
like
many
classics
it
is
simple
and
good
for
me
it
would
go
with
most
of
the
foods
that
i
like
because
of
its
simplicity
cheers
mouthfeel
is
not
as
thin
as
most
lagers
and
has
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
i
would
have
again
i
believe
it
to
be
slightly
above
par
for
the
style
o
pretty
decent
euro
lager
best
on
tap
better
than
bmc
offerings
overall
what
we
have
here
is
just
a
nice
tasting
well
balanced
lager
im
not
sure
its
worth
the
import
price
of
7
50
a
pint
though
not
something
id
buy
again
at
a
bar
based
on
the
price
thats
for
sure
another
500
ml
can
ive
had
several
different
epls
over
the
past
few
nights
and
harp
is
not
really
a
standout
amongst
them
that
being
said
theres
nothing
wrong
with
this
as
a
lager
at
all
other
than
maybe
the
price
point
im
going
to
leave
the
grade
asis
this
is
a
respectable
euro
lager
that
is
worth
a
try
if
youre
into
the
style
o
if
this
beer
were
an
employee
id
give
it
a
meets
expectations
as
a
review
grade
its
not
a
superstar
but
its
a
solid
performer
that
gives
you
what
you
expect
good
taste
and
drinkability
and
you
want
it
to
show
up
the
next
day
i
wish
id
had
a
slice
of
pizza
with
this
that
would
have
gone
perfectly
off
to
make
a
steakumm
sandwich
for
my
next
beer
until
next
time
on
tap
at
tir
na
nog
outside
penn
station
in
nyc
golden
hue
with
slight
amber
capped
by
a
foamy
head
nose
of
grass
and
straw
taste
is
slight
hay
balanced
by
light
cracker
sweetness
mouth
is
light
but
drying
this
is
a
good
way
to
await
a
train
ride
back
upstate
overall
i
have
drank
this
many
times
and
it
is
probably
better
during
warm
weather
and
served
cold
not
a
bad
beer
but
definitely
not
among
the
great
ones
this
goes
for
other
lagers
alike
hope
you
enjoy
salud
o
this
is
a
very
average
beer
this
is
the
first
time
i
have
had
this
and
i
was
thinking
that
it
was
going
to
be
hard
to
drink
and
watered
down
like
the
american
and
euro
lagers
i
have
had
in
the
past
but
this
actually
has
some
umf
to
the
flavor
i
would
not
seek
it
out
but
i
would
drink
it
if
it
was
offered
o
a
typical
maltheavy
euro
lager
but
a
fine
one
for
the
style
because
its
so
crisp
and
refreshing
d
decent
maybe
not
my
fav
but
okay
this
is
a
good
beer
worth
checking
out
this
is
a
damn
good
beer
best
lager
ive
ever
had
screw
the
critics
this
is
gold
lager
or
not
d
not
bad
for
a
lager
not
my
usual
style
of
beer
but
not
bad
nonetheless
i
think
ill
stick
with
guinness
most
famous
though
drinkability
is
very
nice
on
this
euro
lager
i
am
usually
not
a
fan
of
this
type
of
beer
harp
does
not
have
the
sharp
skunk
hop
taste
a
beer
like
a
stella
has
it
is
much
more
drinkable
and
a
lot
better
overall
a
great
outdoor
beer
to
drink
in
quantity
while
smoking
some
meat
over
mesquite
o
uh
decent
for
the
style
unsure
if
i
would
have
this
again
o
this
might
be
the
best
euro
pale
lager
ive
ever
had
but
thats
not
saying
much
the
lack
of
skunky
scents
and
tastes
makes
this
one
a
better
option
than
others
in
the
style
but
its
far
from
interesting
quaffable
and
inoffensive
this
is
one
of
my
starter
beers
that
has
a
little
bit
of
flavor
the
beer
pours
a
nice
golden
color
with
a
nice
white
head
the
smell
has
a
bit
of
hop
and
malt
the
taste
is
pretty
enjoyable
with
a
decent
amount
of
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
with
a
decent
amount
of
carbonation
overall
this
beer
is
decent
but
not
great
it
is
not
a
bad
session
beer
and
i
would
drink
it
again
if
it
was
at
a
party
or
on
sale
overall
well
its
just
okay
honestly
there
is
very
little
manufested
taste
to
be
had
however
and
i
say
this
assuringly
i
would
take
harp
over
any
big
three
lagerpilsner
any
day
of
the
week
it
is
very
refreshing
and
drinkable
highly
recommended
for
celebrationtailgating
beer
cheers
o
this
beer
looks
and
smells
like
an
adjunct
lager
but
has
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
of
a
czech
pilsner
to
me
very
refreshing
and
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
others
definitely
fits
the
bill
for
when
you
want
something
light
and
refreshing

i
may
mix
this
with
a
guinness
instead
of
bass
for
my
next
blacktan
o
friend
of
mine
brought
this
to
a
bachelors
party
it
wasnt
bad
but
it
was
the
last
pack
of
beer
to
be
finished
very
nice

a

with
a

continued
to
bubble
and
come

it
sat
waiting
to

me
again
with
a
malty

even

with

i
enjoyed

and
recommend
giving
it
a
try
for
a
euro
pale
lager
this
one
isnt
bad
o
not
bad
a
little
better
than
expected
i
might
revisit
this
beer
again
in
the
future
maybe
by
a
single
or
two
but
i
doubt
i
would
buy
a
six
pack
overall
its
average
in
my
book
o
the
six
pack
grew
on
me
a
little
bit
when
i
first
tasted
it
i
thought
it
was
just
a
big
waste
of
money
and
i
was
going
to
pawn
them
off
to
my
dad
or
party
guests
or
something
i
ended
up
liking
them
more
as
i
drank
them
mostly
because
there
actually
are
some
hops
and
bitterness
in
the
finish
that
you
dont
get
with
most
other
euro
lagers
notes
trainwreck
of
a
beer
as
bad
as
any
aal
from
bmc
overall
decent
amount
of
flavor
for
a
lager
the
beer
pours
a
light
yellow
color
with
a
large
white
head
the
aroma
is
about
what
i
expected
full
of
grain
with
a
little
bit
of
bread
and
a
tad
bit
of
grass
from
the
hops
the
flavor
is
more
of
the
same
i
get
a
lot
of
grain
and
not
too
much
else
there
is
the
slightest
amount
of
bitterness
from
the
grassy
hops
but
the
beer
is
pretty
sweet
and
malty
thin
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
pours
a
pale
golden
color
with
dissipating
head
that
leaves
lacing
around
the
glass
smells
of
hops
i
wouldnt
call
it
fruity
it
tasted
of
hops
very
slight
sweetness
followed
by
a
little
malt
presence
and
a
dry
crisp
slightly
bitter
finish
not
a
fan
of
pale
lagers
and
this
didnt
change
my
opinion
though
it
is
a
lot
better
than
most
massproduced
american
lagers
a
refreshing
and
enjoyable
beer
overall
its
alright
but
probably
one
to
pass
on
i
think
from
now
on
produced
in
mass
quantities
give
me
a
pbr
over
this
one
poured
a
huge
4
white
head
which
lasted
awhile
pale
clear
straw
yellow
color
smells
of
grass
and
just
barely
the
beginning
of
skunking
taste
is
any
standard
bmc
with
corn
and
a
short
finish
basically
this
is
the
guinness
version
of
mainstream
lagers
probably
with
enough
artificially
jacked
up
carbonation
to
appear
a
step
up
pours
a
solid
straw
yellow
with
a
2
finger
head
that
turns
to
a
lace
quick
with
some
good
retention
a
earthy
grainy
sweet
malt
and
faint
citrus
grainy
maltiness
on
the
tongue
sour
lemon
soap
bitter
on
the
finish
light
in
the
mouth
crisp
enjoyable
aftertaste
light
bodied
overall
this
beer
is
decent
its
got
its
sense
of
drinkability
very
bland
for
its
style
moving
it
to
the
back
of
the
line
when
reaching
for
a
euro
lager
o
have
not
had
this
beer
in
a
few
years
and
i
havent
been
missing
much
pretty
standard
mass
produced
lager
decent
ice
cold
on
a
hot
day
but
drink
it
quickly
since
there
is
not
much
to
savor
when
i
visited
ireland
in
late
february
last
year
this
beer
was
not
as
prevalent
as
i
had
expected
it
to
be
not
much
better
locally
there
either
from
what
i
recall
but
it
was
a
change
of
pace
from
guinness
draught
or
a
bulmers
so
harp
lager
poured
out
as
a
clear
golden
yellow
color
with
a
pretty
nice
looking
head
on
it
the
lacing
isnt
the
best
in
the
world
but
there
is
some
on
the
glass
the
smell
of
fresh
grains
with
a
earthy
sweetness
on
the
nose
the
flavor
is
nice
in
my
opinion
i
find
this
beer
to
be
one
very
good
lager
the
mouthfeel
is
light
crisp
and
refreshing
overall
i
enjoy
this
beer
from
time
to
time
and
i
find
it
to
be
a
great
social
drinking
brew
its
ok
and
easy
to
drink
on
a
hot
day
o
i
really
do
enjoy
this
beer
this
is
one
that
i
can
just
sit
down
and
enjoy
very
balanced
not
to
much
of
anything
not
the
best
but
definitly
a
good
well
rounded
beer
this
beer
has
a
really
clean
taste
it
is
quite
hoppy
for
the
style
which
is
nice
there
are
some
slight
malty
notes
but
the
hops
are
the
most
prevalent
aspect
of
the
flavour
its
a
nice
change
from
any
other
lager
and
definitely
refreshing
but
with
a
bit
of
bite
too
d
if
this
was
any
more
average
it
would
just
say
beer
on
the
label
nothing
worth
going
out
of
the
way
for
this
was
an
average
beer
not
bad
for
a
hot
day
but
not
really
enough
to
want
to
drink
again
at
the
very
least
its
a
decent
choice
when
pickings
are
slim
but
at
best
it
drinks
like
a
halfway
decent
lager
i
favor
english
stouts
and
ales
however
this
lager
is
special
earthy
aromas
greet
the
nose
and
lighten
the
feel
of
this
lager
it
is
refreshing
and
also
somewhat
complex
if
you
pick
apart
its
flavours
of
corn
grass
given
its
pedigree
i
expect
more
and
want
more
it
is
good
but
being
that
its
from
guinness
i
expect
the
highest
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
drying
and
this
is
appropriate
overall
this
beer
is
a
good
standard
lager
not
too
much
to
write
about
its
plain
and
drinkable
dr
4
6
on
tap
is
rickockulous
for
galway
its
not
popular
in
ireland
and
is
the
biggest
disappointment
to
come
out
of
the
guinness
factory
a
smooth
satisfying
lager
by
your
irish
friends
and
certainly
a
notch
or
two
above
most
pale

overall
well
color
me
perplexed
because
i
dont
get
this
beer
it
is
thoroughly
unimpressive
and
lacking
in
uniqueness
and
complexity
i
would
with
100
certainty
turn
down
the
next
free
harp
i
am
offered
pretty
uninviting
overall
to
me
this
beer
enjoyed
on
tap
at
tigin
irish
pub
in
dfw
airport
pours
a
clean
gold
color
with
a
layer
of
head
with
little
retention
but
does
leave
some
lacing
as
you
drink
the
aroma
consists
of
grassy
hops
and
light
malt
the
taste
is
has
hints
of
grassy
hop
a
skunky
characteristics
before
becoming
crisp
with
malt
the
mouthfeel
is
ok
could
use
a
little
more
carbonation
on
the
tap
i
was
drinking
but
definitely
finishes
crisp
o
this
beer
would
be
slumming
it
for
many
bas
its
not
at
all
awful
but
its
definitely
lower
half
of
the
curve
this
is
a
beer
i
default
to
at
pseudoirish
pubs
theres
really
just
a
hint
of
corn
in
it
i
think
appearance
is
a
light
golden
with
a
faint
head
and
nil
lace
smell
has
a
clean
grian
and
adjunct
aroma
with
malt
in
the
background
taste
of
rice
grains
and
the
hops
leaving
a
bitter
dry
finish
in
the
end
mouthfeel
is
light
with
good
carbonation
im
not
to
excited
about
it
but
i
would
like
to
try
it
on
tap
at
the
source
so
i
got
this
in
honor
of
saint
patricks
day
and
i
was
pretty
satisfied
although
a
weebit
on
the
pricy
side
when
i
pored
it
into
the
pint
glass
it
was
a
little
on
the
pale
side
for
my
taste
and
the
smell
was
a
tiny
bit
weak
the
taste
was
very
distinct
and
very
tasty
i
had
a
bit
of
trouble
pounding
that
shit
down
in
which
is
my
normal
method
of
drinking
overall
i
say
a
very
fine
beer
and
worth
a
drink
a
solid
european
lager
but
not
fantastic
probably
goes
better
when
paired
with
guinness
or
food
or
both
pours
a
pale
golden
hue
with
a
thick
head
some
lacing
and
ample
carbonation
looks
like
a
typical
adjunct
lager
the
smell
is
of
malt
and
sweet
cornsyrup
with
a
touch
of
hop
bite
at
the
end
reminds
me
a
lot
of
miller
high
life
the
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
a
touch
of
bite
from
the
carbonation
an
uncomplex
beer
that
tastes
very
much
like
an
adjunct
lager
it
has
a
light
crisp
taste
to
it
something
i
could
drink
sitting
out
back
on
a
nice
warm
springsummer
day
over
all
its
much
better
then
bmc
but
have
had
better
lagers
example
rouges
irish
style
lager
after
hearing
all
the
hype
i
decided
to
pick
up
a
6pack
my
expectations
were
not
met
however
i
was
completely
satisfied
saying
this
beer
lacks
in
flavor
is
a
insult
i
think
its
just
a
plain
lager
although
its
plain
it
makes
up
in
the
drinkability
you
can
drink
tons
of
these
making
it
a
great
beer
the
smell
and
appearance
is
great
and
the
mouthfeel
is
okay
but
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
i
dont
think
its
a
recipe
that
can
even
come
close
to
half
of
the
reputation
that
guinness
has
made
for
itself
pick
some
up
you
wont
be
disappointed
also
they
say
this
is
better
on
tap
so
try
that
out
too
stay
thirsty
my
friends
more
dry
and
bitter
than
most
euro
or
domestics
and
easy
to
drink
but
quite
forgettable
i
feel
odd
reviewing
this
beer
as
i
feel
most
everyone
in
the
world
has
had
it
at
this
point
its
a
lager
its
not
particularly
great
it
is
the
only
beer
ive
successfully
made
a
black
tan
with
so
for
that
reason
i
will
hold
it
dearly
in
my
heart
the
taste
is
rather
nondescript
in
that
nothing
stands
out
very
much
its
a
very
clean
beer
really
unlike
other
euro
lagers
it
isnt
heavy
on
the
skunkiness
or
grains
the
body
has
small
notes
of
grain
and
a
little
citrus
pretty
goid
hop
bite
at
the
end
for
style
crisp
not
bad
if
not
a
little
boring
pours
a
pale
golden
amber
with
a
semiquickly
diminshing
head
scent
of
standard
wheat
and
malts
mixture
taste
is
mediocre
with
a
very
grassy
grain
taste
to
it
a
little
bit
of
an
after
taste
but
nothing
too
strong
a
decent
beer
to
celebrate
the
irish
in
you
but
nothing
all
that
fantastic
aaaahhh
guinness
blonde
headed
step
child
harp
is
a
very
taste
beer
for
those
who
cant
stomach
the
real
goods
yeah
thats
right
the
real
good
guinness
harp
is
a
tasty
alternative
to
going
the
distance
the
color
is
goldenpale
yellow
with
white
foam
no
aroma
solid
taste
and
it
is
an
easy
session
beer
this
is
somewhere
between
a
yawn
and
an
ugh
even
on
future
st
pattys
days
this
will
not
be
worth
revisiting
overall
its
just
a
boring
beer
if
i
want
something
refreshing
i
would
much
rather
drink
a
nice
german
pilsner
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
is
a
crystal
clear
strawgold
color
with
a
chunky
white
big
bubbled
foam
head
aromas
of
toasted
oats
and
light
malty
notes
the
beer
is
round
and
a
little
oily
slick
in
mouth
with
slightly
sourmalt
flavors
and
a
very
light
hop
flavor
to
balance
also
some
cereal
type
flavors
the
beer
has
an
extremely
quick
finish
with
only
trace
sour
notes
on
the
aftertaste
the
beer
is
extremely
easy
to
drink
and
goes
with
just
about
anything
overall
beer

on
my
way
to
pakistan
sitting
in
the
ac
lounge
access
to
my
own
taps
this
is
living
good
beer
simple
and
refreshing
this
ones
for
you
spinrsx
a
very
drinkable
lager
that
does
not
overfill
but
has
a
refreshing
effect
tastes
of
an
sweeter
lager
good
bittering
balance
with
malt
clean
and
easy
drinking
low
spec
malt
okay
for
a
staple
beer
is
one
appreciates
euro
lager
the
beer
was
a
pale
clear
golden
color
with
a
thick
bubbly
white
head
it
smells
of
grass
and
lemon
with
nutty
undertones
the
taste
consists
of
bread
and
grass
with
a
lemony
hoppy
aftertaste
the
beer
is
light
without
being
watery
it
prickles
the
tongue
and
leaves
the
mouth
dry
i
thought
this
was
an
above
average
euro
lager
look
forward
to
making
a
black
tan
later
d
an
easy
drinking
beer
and
easily
sessionable
but
little
about
it
thats
all
that
distinguishable
from
other
euro
lagers
d
you
can
certainly
throw
a
few
of
these
back
just
nothing
special
or
standout
about
this
beer
at
all
probably
can
get
equal
quality
for
much
less
pours
a
clear
golden
yellow
with
lots
of
head
up
front
finding
a
thin
medium
after
about
a
minute
lacing
is
pretty
cool
makes
rings
on
the
glass
as
i
drink
it
and
leaves
a
consistent
lace
all
around
smells
of
livht
malts
and
slight
hops
tastes
kind
of
citrusy
with
a
little
hop
right
off
the
back
of
the
tounge
the
carbonation
is
not
shy
and
leaves
a
dryness
in
my
mouth
that
makes
me
want
to
drink
another
gulp
pours
a
very
light
straw
pale
yellow
color
with
a
thin
white
head
and
very
little
lacing
smells
of
pale
malts
and
a
little
corn
or
grain
very
mediocre
tastes
of
pale
malts
a
little
noble
hop
and
some
slight
grain
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
it
has
a
fair
amount
of
carbonation
drinkability
is
okay
pretty
interesting
this
lager
is
its
very
fizzy
and
has
a
wheat
taste
to
it
leaves
a
citrus
aftertaste
which
is
nice
and
id
recommend
this
for
people
who
like
lagers
to
try
its
interesting
not
the
most
adventurous
beer
by
a
long
shot
but
when
it
comes
to
if
youll
forgive
the
term
continental
lagers
you
can
do
a
lot
worse
taste
is
dry
the
flavors
dont
feel
natural
no
sweet
malts

this
was
the
best
beer
i
had
this
entire
weekend
this
is
in
my
opinion
should
be
what
most
lagers
should
aspire
to
be
this
was
a
nice
straw
blonde
pouring
out
into
a
glass
with
a
decent
1
to
1
and
half
finger
head
that
when
settled
left
a
little
lace
down
the
side
of
the
glass
the
taste
was
spot
on
for
a
lager
as
it
was
clean
but
a
little
unremarkable
for
me
tomorrow
when
i
go
to
play
darts

the
wife

had
this
beer
on
tap
in
one
of
the
local
pubs
it
is
a
little
darker
than
most
lagers
i
have
tried
with
the
average
malty
sweet
aroma
most
lagers
have
with
a
bit
of
grain
the
taste
is
good
a
little
bitter
up
front
with
a
buttery
after
taste
mouth
feel
is
average
to
a
bit
watery
this
beer
is
fairly
drinkable
just
not

the

clean
if
thats
what
your
looking
for
it
was
sweet
and
slightly

with

it
reminded
me
of
a

i
found
myself
recently
at
disney
world
with
the
family
and
one
night
we
ended
up
in
the
uk
section
of
epcot
they
had
a
stand
there
with
bass
and
harp
on
tap
and
i
ordered
a
yard
of
harp
and
watched
a
band
playing
beatles
tunes
it
was
my
first
time
trying
harp
and
i
enjoyed

good
but
i
am
telling
you
add
the
lime
cordial
mtnboyjan

more
of
grain
and
malt
the
taste
is
solid
and
refreshing
overall
a
substandard
eurolager
but
useful
as
a
crossover
beer
at
least
from
the
standpoint
of
getting
someone
to
drink
something
else
that
tastes
just
like
x

poured
12
oz
bottle
into
a
glass
mug
a
light
golden
color
with
a
thick
white
head
thats
retained
pretty
much
throughout
the
beer
a
malty
smell
malty
taste
with
hints
of
bitterness
and
a
slightly
sweet
aftertaste
decent
mouthfeel
pretty
drinkable
beer
overall
d
goes
down
easy
and
not
too
filling
but
not
very
tasty
at
all
to
be
perfectly
honest
i
dont
think
i
can
see
myself
drinking
this
beer
again
under
any
circumstances
drinkability
good
you
could
have
a
few
in
a
night
this
might
be
ok
after
drinking
a
heavier
beer
drinkablity
is
decent
due
to
the
light
and
refreshing
albeit
watery
mouthfeel
and
the
cheap
price
6
for
a
sixer
at
walmart
this
is
nothing
to
sit
sip
and
ponder
but
it
goes
down
easy
and
is
a
notch
above
bmc
swill
also
very
good
for
initiating
nonbas
and
weaning
them
away
from
bmc
d
not
too
bad
really
even
thought
the
mouthfeel
sucks
and
the
flavor
is
medicore
it
is
something
somewhat
drinkable
as
a
german
pilsner
ripoff
it
isnt
my
favorite
style
but
it
sure
beats
heineken
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
a
good
representation
of
the
style
its
probably
not
the
best
lager
ive
ever
had
but
passable
and
i
would
certainly
have
it
again
get
my
buzz
on
y
d
this
seems
different
than
what
i
remember
from
a
few
years
ago
i
know
they
started
to
brew
this
in
canada
for
north
america
but
it
shouldnt
change
too
much
still
a
very
nice
lager
and
very
sessionable
this
beer
poured
a
clear
straw
color
with
a
thin
head
the
smell
was
mild
and
faint
of
hops
the
taste
was
smooth
and
balanced
the
mouthfeel
was
full
bodied
the
drinkability
is
smooth
and
easy
overall
my
impression
is
that
this
is
a
decent
middle
of
the
road
beer
that
goes
down
easy
but
at
the
same
time
doesnt
really
have
any
characteristics
that
grab
you
it
definitely
beats
a
domestic
and
would
be
a
great
cold
lager
on
a
hot
day
this
is
a
decent
lager
that
warrants
no
more
than
a
brief
second
look
from
the
first
time
sampler
it
seemed
to
be
a
better
beer
several
years
ago
prior
to
guinness
ownership
it
is
good
but
not
great
on
just
about
all
counts
this
and
carlsberg
are
on
tap
in
every
pub
in
ireland
if
you
need
a
break
from
stout
during
your
irish
excursion
opt
for
the
carlsberg
its
much
better
on
tap
especially
in
europe
harp
is
average
across
the
board
not
bad
not
great
itll
do
in
a
pinch
and
thats
about
it
harp
lager
is
golden
in
color
and
very
clear
it
had
a
large
white
head
with
rather
good
retention
and
spotty
lacing
there
is
not
much
in
the
nose
a
little
sweet
malt
and
noble
hop
aroma
the
taste
was
some
noble
hops
with
some
light
malt
and
a
clean
dry
finish
this
is
a
smooth
mediumlight
bodied
lager
with
medium
carbonation
it
is
easy
drinking
and
refreshing
a
step
or
two
above
the
average
american
macro
lager
it
would
work
well
for
a
session
beer
ive
always
liked
harp
lager
maybe
in
keeping
with
my
irish
roots
on
the
overall
beer
rating
scale
it
is
hard
to
give
this
real
high
scores
in
aroma
appearance
or
palate
but
its
a
smooth
drinking
beer
has
a
good
taste
and
is
a
far
cry
above
many
of
its
american
macro
lager
counterparts
erin
go
braugh
the
beer
is
very
good
for
its
style
probably
my
favorite
other
than
stella
artois
and
possibly
tyskie
very
mild
malt
flavor
that
is
a
bit
sweet
with
just
a
touch
and
i
do
mean
a
touch
of
hops
mouth
feel
is
ok
kinda
soft
with
out
much
carbonation
i
could
have
10
and
not
feel
full
though
so
it
is
very
drinkable
eric
harp
is
golden
with
a
nice
level
of
carbonation
head
is
tall
with
thick
foam
aroma
is
somewhat
weak
and
shortlived
smell
is
typical
lager
with
a
bit
of
herbal
hop
the
flavor
is
decent
with
just
a
bit
of
adjunct
offflavors
the
overall
flavor
is
bitterer
than
most
of
the
style
with
a
good
herbal
hop
punch
a
bit
of
malt
sweetness
pops
through
near
the
end
of
a
sip
still
there
doesnt
seem
to
be
enough
substance
here
to
keep
me
very
interested
finish
is
somewhat
metallic
overall
just
slightly
better
than
average
for
the
style
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
but
tastewise
it
is
quite
low
id
say
for
its
style
it
is
good
but
i
wouldnt
buy
a
six
pack
of
this
especially
for
the
price
overall
a
nice
drink
due
to
its
good
overall
balance
this
beer
frankly
looks
lagery
golden
in
color
with
a
thin
head
and
a
lot
of
effervesence
tilting
your
glass
produces
a
wall
of
lacing
the
aroma
presents
nothing
distinct
its
clean
and
fresh
with
a
little
bit
of
alcohol
and
maybe
some
esters
but
nothing
really
jumps
out
taste
is
pleasant
crisp
maltysweet
with
maybe
a
little
bit
of
that
ester
poking
through
the
overall
effect
is
something
like
a
sourdough
pretzel
or
maybe
a
bowl
of
cheerios
dry
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
light
but
the
stuff
feels
heavy
in
your
stomach
probably
very
sessionable
if
you
have
the
means
but
not
cheap
what
can
i
say
this
is
a
classic
although
steinlager
is
my
favorite
in
this
category
its
a
bit
light
on
the
mouthfeel
but
that
makes
it
that
much
eaiser
to
drink
overall
while
not
terribly
offensive
it
was
a
belowaverage
euro
lager
overly
simple
boring
and
pretty
tasteless
it
pours
golden
in
color
makes
a
nice
attempt
at
becoming
hazy
but
doesnt
quite
succeed
smell
is
indifferent
it
tastes
better
than
mr
bud
mcmillers
beer
but
that
shouldnt
be
considered
too
difficult
anyways
not
a
bad
beer
if
you
can
catch
a
sale
or
a
good
deal
i
probably
wouldnt
pay
good
money
for
this
one
if
there
was
better
available
but
i
sure
wouldnt
turn
one
down
harp
lager
pours
a
macro
looking
yellow
with
a
fluffy
white
head
from
a
brown
twelve
ounce
bottle
has
a
nasty
skunklike
aroma
taste
is
better
than
i
expected
given
the
appearance
and
aroma
decent
balance
of
hops
and
malt
if
a
bit
skunky
the
skunk
being
fairly
typical
for
the
euro
pale
lager
profile
not
offensive
perhaps
a
step
up
from
the
big
three
tastes
of
malt
hints
of
adjunct
cereal
flavours
a
bit
of
hops
somewhat
harsh
and
acidic
on
the
tongue
seems
over
carbonated
drinkable
nonetheless
better
with
food
not
the
best
lager
ive
had
but
not
the
worst
overall
a
very
drinkable
lager
i
previously
reviewed
the
canned
version
that
i
bought
in
ireland
the
bottled
version
that
is
available
in
the
u
s
is
an
entirely
different
beer
d
again
i
like
it
a
nice
change
to
the
beer
drawer
drinkability
overall
this
isnt
a
bad
brew
though
of
course
by
many
its
overrated
still
id
drink
it
again
as
it
goes
down
smoothly
enough
and
is
better
than
many
macros
out
there
i
dont
like
it
when
beer
makes
my
tastebuds
jump
off
my
tongue
in
order
to
get
away
from
the
taste
harp
has
such
a
sharp
biting
sting
that
just
doesnt
set
well
with
me
i
stuck
my
nose
in
it
and
i
thought
all
would
be
well
but
im
just
not
into
it
then
again
i
am
a
bit
of
a
wimp
i
know
plenty
of
people
that
rave
about
harp
i
dont
think
ill
ever
be
one
of
those
people
as
far
as
a
lager
goes
this
is
one
of
the
best
ive
had
in
some
while
it
didnt
knock
my
socks
off
but
im
pretty
impressed
as
its
head
and
shoulders
above
any
other
lager
ive
had
in
the
past
couple
of
years
well
balanced
smooth
crisp
good
malt
spine
yet
with
a
bit
of
a
hop
presence
and
bite
ill
be
buying
more
of
this
soon
not
a
bad
lager
this
is
first
euro
pale
and
i
see
potential
in
the
style
i
wish
this
beer
had
more
depth
to
it
between
the
color
mouthfeel
range
of
flavors
and
aftertaste
it
came
across
as
being
thin
and
watereddown
not
a
bad
session
beer
but
most
common
offerings
in
the
euro
pale
lager
style
can
make
that
claim
as
well
this
beers
only
distinction
is
its
country
of
origin
barely
worth
a
try
drinkability
i
would
rate
as
fairly
high
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
and
i
could
certainly
see
myself
havin
a
session
with
these
worth
a
try
reminded
me
a
bit
of
a
eurolager
but
none
of
that
skunky
aftertaste
drinkability
could
be
a
nice
session
beer
but
the
bitter
grains
could
become
a
drawback
really
nice
mouthfeel
much
better
than
i
expected
to
be
honest
the
body
on
this
beer
is
possibly
the
most
full
body
ive
ever
come
across
when
it
comes
to
pale
lagers
creamy
is
the
word
that
best
describes
how
it
feels
on
my
palate
it
is
easy
to
drink
and
goes
down
smooth
this
is
something
that
i
can
see
myself
buying
again
but
not
while
there
are
selections
on
the
shelves
that
i
havent
yet
tried
a
good
beer
definitely
one
that
im
sure
to
come
back
to
in
the
future
but
just
not
anytime
soon
its
not
something
that
is
so
good
that
you
crave
it
every
so
often
such
as
arrogant
bastard
and
chimay
grand
reserve
not
a
fan
i
honestly
would
rather
have
a
cup
of
water
overall
better
than
average
in
an
unremarkable
style
go
down
good
as
a
st
paddys
day
leftover
but
certainly
not
to
be
sought
out
overall
impression
this
one
was
left
over
from
a
st
pats
party
it
isnt
bad
but
also
not
something
i
will
be
seeking
out
as
lagers
go
this
is
actually
a
really
nice
one
not
much
in
the
way
of
hops
but
again
its
a
lager
other
than
that
not
your
typical
lawnmower
beer
a
huge
body
as
far
as
lagers
go
i
like
it
actually
the
taste
is
crisp
and
slightly
sweet
the
hops
add
a
nice
bit
of
balance
and
some
spice
notes
not
a
world
beater
but
it
beats
the
pants
off
the
big
three
easy
to
pair
with
non
spicy
food
easy
drinker
with
excellent
carbonation
i
like
this
much
beter
on
tap
but
still
not
enough
to
be
a
regular
the
euro
pale
lagers
havent
really
excited
me
much
but
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
today
i
bought
it
for
the
free
glass
deal
but
i
got
a
decent
lager
out
of
it
a
classic
pours
out
to
a
nice
medium
golden
color
with
a
big
white
head
of
foam
great
head
retention
lots
of
lacing
medium
level
of
carbonation
aromas
of
dry
hops
and
some
citrus
notes
over
malt
fills
the
nose
taste
is
medium
bodied
flavors
of
grass
malts
bitter
hops
some
cereal
grain
good
taste
for
the
style
mouthfeel
is
good
solid
carbonation
keeps
things
moving
and
adds
to
the
higher
level
of
drinkability
slighty
slick
as
well
but
not
oily
good
drinkability
i
should
have
this
more
often
i
cant
believe
ive
never
reviewed
it
recommended
mix
with
equal
parts
of
cider
for
an
interesting
concoction
the
beer
pours
a
vibrant
gold
with
delicate
carbonation
keeping
a
fluffy
white
head
afloat
the
taste
is
light
and
sweet
with
just
a
pinch
of
english
hops
thrown
in
at
the
fore
it
is
quite
possibly
the
sweetest
eurolager
ive
had
which
isnt
a
bad
thing
just
different
i
drink
it
i
like
it
yeah
nice
and
simple
no
complaints
mouthfeel
was
quite
crisp
and
cleansing
medium
body
overall
a
beer
that
you
could
just
sit
around
and
have
a
casual
chat
which
is
what
i
did
nothing
special
but
acceptable
d
not
one
ill
be
buying
again
anytime
soon
stella
artois
or
grolsch
would
be
a
better
example
tostyle
pours
a
mediumlight
yellow
with
a
decent
fizzy
head
that
dissipates
fairly
quickly
and
leaves
very
little
lacing
smell
is
slight
with
some
hops
and
a
faint
metallic
scent
accompanying
the
malts
taste
is
stronger
with
a
malt
base
that
has
some
grains
in
it
and
then
a
nice
hop
bite
and
some
butter
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
well
carbonated
and
more
robust
than
the
average
lager
and
drinkability
is
very
good
this
beer
actually
exceeded
my
expectations
even
if
its
not
exactly
stellar
d
it
is
a
smooth
drinking
pale
lager
with
not
much
excitement
to
it
this
is
my
definition
of
an
average
beer
not
bad
the
nice
thing
about
this
beer
is
that
you
can
find
it
even
in
the
most
macroinfested
bars
so
its
a
good
beer
to
fall
back
on
the
problem
with
this
beer
though
is
that
it
has
too
much
in
common
with
those
macros
its
a
wee
bit
bland
its
kinda
thin
and
although
im
not
sure
that
they
use
adjuncts
in
brewing
it
harp
certainly
has
that
type
of
taste
and
mouthfeel
still
its
not
bad
especially
if
youre
just
getting
into
craft
beer
recommended
i
think
of
this
as
a
kind
of
a
yellow
fizzy
little
beer
the
lace
is
thin
and
has
a
very
light
body
i
get
a
little
bit
of
sweetness
on
the
tongue
and
then
a
bitter
grain
follow
through
i
think
this
beer
gets
picked
up
more
because
they
see
who
brews
it
if
it
wasnt
for
the
name
i
think
this
beer
would
get
lost
on
the
shelf
with
all
the
other
random
lagers
the
clear
mellow
gold
pint
is
topped
with
a
sparkling
white
head
of
small
bubbles
that
left
a
moderate
amount
of
lacing
a
few
carbonation
streams
were
present
but
not
overly
active
the
smell
is
clean
and
only
suggestive
of
some
grain
and
hops
nothing
stood
out
as
overly
distinctive
the
taste
was
initially
sweet
winding
down
to
a
fairly
tamelimp
hop
finish
nothing
crisp
about
it
a
bit
grainy
deeper
into
the
pint
but
overall
fairly
mundane
light
body
and
frothy
carbonation
led
to
a
light
mouthfeel
something
seemed
chemical
about
this
beer
but
i
could
not
put
my
finger
on
it
i
did
not
find
this
to
be
overly
enjoyable
i
liked
the
bitterness
and
it
had
a
decent
zing
on
my
tongue
but
blast
it
but
that
slightly
nasty
taste
undertaste
was
detracting
from
every
step
of
the
experience
my
palette
knoweldge
base
arent
developed
enough
to
know
why
that
unfortunate
aspect
of
the
taste
was
there
but
i
know
this
much
if
i
want
to
seek
it
out
which
i
wont
ill
just
buy
a
budweiser
not
to
pick
on
bud
in
particularit
is
what
it
is
this
beer
is
pleasant
without
being
great
definitely
preferable
to
smithwicks
or
its
other
domestic
lager
rivals
pours
a
clear
medium
gold
with
a
small
white
foamy
quickly
diminishing
head
smells
of
lightly
sweet
cookielike
malts
with
some
grainy
aromas
and
a
light
herbal
hop
presence
the
taste
is
crisp
and
grainy
yet
its
smooth
surprisingly
smooth
for
a
euro
pale
with
a
nicely
bittered
floral
finish
it
has
a
mediumthin
body
dry
texture
light
astringency
and
moderate
carbonation
well
im
impressed
and
i
dont
even
like
this
style
of
beer
that
much
its
a
delicious
and
enjoyable
lager
ill
definitely
give
this
one
a
thumbsup
nicely
done
i
hear
the
real
version
is
even
better
maybe
some
day
d
a
bit
disappointed
by
this
one
for
some
reason
i
expected

i

2006
this
was
one
of
the
beers
that
helped
me
bridge
the
gap
between
coors
light
and
better
beer
and
i
can
see
why
its
still
good
pours
light
gold
with
a
huge
head
the
nose
has
some
hops
and
the
taste
also
seems
full
and
slightly
hoppy
not
a
bad
lager
that
only
has
a
slight
corn
finish
not
up
to
grolsch
level
but
drinkable
i
am
not
sure
what
would
make
me
buy
this
again
as
the
price
is
import
but
the
taste
says
domestic
this
beer
intrigued
me
as
it
combines
light
color
and
carbonation
with
an
aroma
and
taste
of
maltiness
and
hoppiness
the
taste
and
aroma
lead
one
to
believe
it
could
be
a
brother
of
guinness
although
the
color
is
deceptive
i
would
gladly
drink
this
again
although
it
is
not
good
enough
to
warrant
the
difference
in
price
between
it
and
american
macro
lagers
in
my
opinion
another
good
point
is
that
there
is
very
little
aftertaste
i
highly
recommend
that
it
is
tried
on
tap
great
to
accompany
a
sunday
football
game
or
to
go
with
burgers
or
steak
not
particularly
drinkable
for
me
i
could
down
another
one
if
i
had
to
but
i
cant
forsee
any
reason
to
buy
this
again
decently
drinkable
although
not
really
a
standout
within
the
style
i
didnt
find
it
interesting
enough
to
be
sessionable
although
theres
nothing
too
objectionable
about
it
not
worth
it
for
the
price
a
decent
euro
pale
strong
golden
color
with
a
decent
head
couldve
lasted
a
little
longer
though
more
hops
in
this
beer
than
i
originally
thought
but
a
little
malt
balances
at
the
end
overall
nothing
spectacular
but
one
of
the
better
though
more
expensive
macro
lagers
crystal

color
with
a

aroma

flavor
is
light
also
grassy
and
bitter
but
not
a

bitter
just
bitter
highlights
of
corn
and
florals
with
an
unpleasant
burnt
rubber
finish
watery
mouthfeel
somewhat
dry
and
crisp
finish
low
drinkability
looks
very
much
like
a
pilsener
but
appears
more
watered
down
in
texture
and
golden
color
some
head
but
not
very
thick
with
poor
retention
i
detect
aromas
of
malt
and
alcohol
a
poorly
balanced
beer
with
fleeting
bitterness
and
sticky
sensation
in
my
throat
this
is
not
a
very
enjoyable
beer
because
it
lacks
substance
the
aftertaste
is
also
very
powerful
and
grows
as
you
take
more
sips
usually
found
ontap
in
many
average
bars
but
not
worth
paying
for
pours
a
crystal
clear
golden
hue
with
a
bubbly
two
finger
head
excellent
retention
but
only
modest
lacing
the
smell
is
toasted
pale
malt
with
little
hop
influence
a
simple
but
balanced
flavor
of
sweet
pale
malt
and
euro
hops
the
sweet
flavor
has
some
estery
tones
but
the
dry
aftertaste
hides
any
impurities
a
high
level
of
carbonation
and
light
body
give
it
a
crisp
mouthfeel
and
a
very
mild
residual
sweetness
allows
a
good
drinkability
this
poured
a
nice
golden
color
with
a
huge
airy
and
long
lasting
head
the
aroma
is
not
quite
skunky
but
it
hints
at
it
sorta
nice
though
not
too
strong
the
taste
is
pretty
basic
mild
hops
but
pleasantly
fruity
this
is
very
drinkable
im
not
sure
why
i
like
this
so
much
the
taste
is
different
than
regular
lagers
but
not
nasty
like
most
euro
lagers
hmmm
dark
bottles
rule
stupid
grolsh
becks
heine
its
low
hop
bitterness
and
bland
flavors
are
helped
by
an
above
average
mouthfeel
making
it
fairly
drinkable
i
remember
when
having
a
harp
from
the
tap
was
a
big
deal
upon
pouring
a
light
floral
hop
aroma
tantalizes
the
olfactory
senses
while
the
relatively
thin
head
quickly
dissipates
a
solid
though
by
no
means
overpowering
hop
profile
is
nicely
accompanied
by
just
enough
malt
to
balance
the
brew
creating
a
rich
full
bodied
beer
distinguished
by
a
buttery
mouthfeel
with
a
splash
of
citrus
i
found
harp
to
be
reminiscent
of
an
oakey
chardonnay
the
finish
is
clean
crisp
and
slightly
hoppy
with
just
a
touch
of
bitterness

are
of

better

said
the
giant
with
the
outlier
overall
poor
craft
being
too
watery
and
a
little
stale
justifying
my
taste
with
this
comment
nice
solid
beer
this
beer
is
a
beer
that
bust
be
really
cold
when
in
rome
do
as
rome
does
but
ill
drink
their
wine
rather
than
this
horse
piss
solid
lager
small
head
nothing
fancy
enjoyed
thoroughly
just
so
drinkable
why
do
brewers
keep
putting
beer
in
green
bottles
ive
never
had
a
green
bottle
import
that
didnt
taste
at
least
a
little
skunky
put
that
aside
and
this
is
an
easy
drinking
lawn
mowing
beer
nothing
great
but
serves
a
purpose
your
average
euro
lager
slight
skunk
and
plenty
of
grain
very
beery
beer
average
but
not
bad
have
it
ontap
and
leave
your
snobbery
at
the
door
boring
normal
bloody
lager
dull
nice
easy
drinking
lager
thats
clean
sessionable
the
most
common
italian
beer
nothing
to
see
here
mo
a
perfect
example
of
what
a
clean
crisp
lager
should
be
thin
bodied
and
plenty
of
palate
scrubbing
carbonation
make
this
a
great
session
beer
for
a
club
meeting
in
the
evening
it
really
can
be
enjoyed
by
everyone
and
has
more
flavor
than
standard
bmc
offerings
without
the
tang
of
typical
euro
lagers
ive
bought
this
before
and
ill
buy
it
again
i
like
it
for
what
it
is
and
think
its
an
underrated
beer
aroma
is
skunk
and
bread
the
flavor
is
bread
fruit
and
a
mildly
bitter
finish
tasted
like
a
bad
heineken
ehhhhhhh
not
great
kind
of
cheap
not
really
a
bad
beer
but
very
weak
i
would
only
drink
this
if
it
was
free
which
it
was
coupon
giveaway
outside
the
lcbo
its
drinkable
but
not
my
every
day
beer
a
mediocre
choice
nothing
special
somewhat
refreshing
a
grassy
tasting
decent
lager
pairs
well
with
spicier
foods
or
garlic
i
find
it
nice
with
italian
food
everyone
once
in
a
while
nothing
special
its
a
whatever
beer
nothing
special
edit
firstimpression
review
is
above
ive
modified
my
scores
a
bit
since
then
after
having
this
a
few
more
times
and
finding
that
i
dont
like
it
quite
as
much
now
as
i
did
then
overall
a
fairly
standard
cheap
euro
macro
lager
so
i
guess
you
get
what
you
pay
for
at
52
a
case
there
are
definitely
better
beers
for
less
i
am
neutral
on
this
beer
theres
a
reason
italy
is
known
for
wine
and
not
beer
when
in
rome
drink
wine
overall
a
decent
italian
beer
i
have
been
critical
of
most
but
this
is
average
and
i
will
drink
this
again
if
offered
overall
the
beer
is
not
stellar
but
its
really
not
bad
drink
it
on
tap
and
you
will
not
regret
it
i
found
myself
liking
it
more
and
more
as
i
sipped
it
like
i
said
it
goes
well
with
italian
food
but
also
with
just
about
anything
else
a
good
solid
european
lager
this
beer
is
quite
similar
to
other
euro
lagers
like
heineken
and
stella
artois
if
i
was
sitting
in
a
sidewalk
cafe
in
rome
it
would
be
perfect
at
my
dinner
table
in
ky
its
still
ok
if
you
are
a
euro
lager
fan
this
is
worth
a
try
i
couldnt
drink
it
every
day
but
its
interesting
for
a
oneoff
overall
a
passable
lager
but
has
nothing
that
stands
out
from
the
pack
drinkable
but
not
my
first
choice
or
second
or
third
if
theres
nothing
else
available
bland
taste
skunky
smell
fizzy
with
no
return
of
flavor
it
went
down
without
even
noticing
it
wasnt
really
soda
water
perhaps
for
a
really
hot
day
when
im
out
of
every
other
beer
and
the
water
hosedog
dish
is
too
far
away
to
drink
from
for
the
style
peroni
offers
powerful
euro
lager
flavours
yet
a
light
and
crisp
experience
also
not
bad
nothing
exceptional
either
overall
just
like
any
other
green
bottled
beer
from
europe
lager
beers
are
underrated
a
bit
and
peroni
is
one
of
them
it
has
good
quality
and
taste
also
its
very
convenient
in
hot
weather
i
popped
the
cap
and
began
the
aggro
pour
creating
both
a
pseudocascade
and
forming
a
brief
finger
of
bonewhite
head
that
quickly
fell
to
wisps
color
was
a
pale
lemonyellow
srm
2
4
with
nequality
clarity
nose
had
a
pleasant
saazlike
grassiness
mouthfeel
was
thintomedium
the
taste
was
odd
grassy
but
with
a
light
cheesiness
like
sharp
cheddar
it
was
not
prevalent
but
it
was
noticeable
all
the
same
finish
was
light
spritzy
semidry
nice
on
a
hot
humid
day
after
some
gardening
but
there
are
much
better
iterations
of
the
style
out
there
an
ok
lager
typical
mass
produced
taste
nothing
special
bottle
looks
awesome
and
refined
but
i
am
sure
it
is
a
selling
point
label
looks
like
a
fancy
water
brand
pours
ok
with
a
somewhat
skunky
smell
taste
is
right
from
the
start
skunky
and
is
typical
of
a
mainstream
overproduced
less
refined
beer
ok
but
it
has
to
be
cold
or
dont
even
bother
poured
a
clear
golden
yellow
with
three
fingers
of
fluffy
white
head
that
slowly
receded
to
two
fingers
of
fluffy
white
head
leaving
abundant
lacing
down
the
glass
a
pretty
nice
full
look
for
a
euro
pale
lager
not
bad
scents
of
skunky
hops
grainy
malt
biscuity
malt
and
some
faint
malty
sweetness
an
expected
aroma
for
a
green
bottled
euro
pale
lager
taste
begins
with
slight
sweet
grainy
flavors
and
faint
maize
moving
into
some
hop
extract
and
floralherbal
hop
flavors
finish
is
semidry
with
a
hop
extract
bitterness
grain
husk
and
sweet
malt
aftertaste
is
dry
with
notes
of
herbal
hops
floral
hops
and
bitterness
with
slight
graininess
a
decent
flavor
for
a
euro
pale
lager
a
lot
more
flavor
than
the
american
lagers
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
and
semidry
feel
fairly
true
to
form
for
a
lager
not
bad
overall
a
fairly
good
euro
pale
lager
not
the
best
but
a
pretty
good
flavor
profile
overall
though
the
aroma
is
a
bit
of
a
letdown
not
bad
but
not
really
worth
having
again
i
dont
want
to
do
negative
reviews
on
beers
because
i
feel
in
away
every
beer
is
something
that
somebody
made
almost
an
art
but
this
is
the
first
year
ive
ever
had
that
actually
made
me
sick
two
sips
into
the
spear
and
my
stomach
went
haywire
the
smell
was
very
faint
but
it
actually
had
and
almost
fruity
aroma
the
appearance
was
nothing
more
than
a
light
beer
peroni
nastro
azzurro
brewed
by
birra
peroni
industriale
s
p
a
this
brew
has
an
abv
of
5
1
and
pours
out
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
small
white
head
the
head
to
this
brew
goes
away
fast
the
smell
is
really
skucky
with
some
grains
not
what
i
was
looking
for
in
the
smell
but
that
is
the
style
of
brew
it
also
does
not
help
that
it
comes
out
of
a
green
bottle
the
taste
is
bitter
and
skunky
at
first
the
after
taste
is
smooth
and
clean
the
mouthfeel
at
first
is
not
so
good
but
it
nice
at
end
over
all
im
giving
this
3
out
of
5
overall
a
neutral
3
for
peroni
didnt
much
care
for
the
skunkiness
i
doubt
ill
buy
this
brew
again
contrary
to
the
smell
it
has
not
fruity
taste
at
all
it
burns
the
mouth
which
effectively
removes
all
other
tastes
the
burning
feel
makes
it
hard
to
even
take
a
large
sip
a
stronger
taste
would
go
a
long
way
to
make
this
beer
better
as
it
stands
there
is
not
much
of
a
taste
to
analyze
o
unimpressed
no
powerful
taste
no
remarkable
aroma
very
light
average
brew
enjoy
flavor
pleasant
combination
of
sweet
barley
malt
some
grassy
flavor
and
some
hop
spice
nicely
refreshing
and
easily
drinkable
although
it
could
use
a
bit
more
taste
overall
i
liked
this
beer
and
will
purchase
it
again
ordering
this
in
a
bar
or
pub
will
make
me
feel
fancy
slightly
skunky
and
a
bit
bitter
clean
finish
not
any
head
to
speak
of
keeps
carbonation
very
light
pairs
well
with
pizza
or
hamburger
does
not
fill
the
stomach
up
i
enjoyed
this
beer
sitting
and
sipping
does
not
force
too
much
of
a
taste
easy
to
drink
in
the
bottle
this
beer
is
fantastic
and
far
superior
to
most
beer
this
seems
to
just
be
in
ireland
where
draught
beer
is
muck
and
after
only
a
few
there
is
a
hangover
the
next
day
does
anyone
else
find
this
or
is
if
just
me
can
they
put
what
they
like
in
beer
in
ireland
and
not
in
other
countries
i
never
get
this
when
i
am
abroad
o
not
a
favorite
of
mine
but
given
what
it
is
its
certainly
drinkable
this
italian
beer
is
decent
but
not
the
best
poured
into
my
trusty
pint
glass
and
light
color
with
little
to
no
head
taste
isnt
bad
as
long
as
its
poured
into
pint
glass
nothing
spectacular
about
the
beer
but
it
is
better
than
the
american
lagers
tried
on
tap
at
a
calgary
pizza
joint
served
in
an
authentic
tall
peroni
glass
the
subject
of
a
recent
advertising
campaign
here
in
alberta
and
likely
elsewhere
in
north
america
looks
like
a
standard
massproduced
euro
pale
lager
maybe
just
a
hair
darker
a
straw
lemon
yellow
with
a
fearsome
degree
of
carbonation
smells
of
sweet
doughy
malt
bakers
yeast
a
hint
of
dry
grassy
hop
extract
most
likely
initially
quite
sweet
to
my
palate
and
thick
for
the
style
but
manages
to
finish
dry
inky
oxidized
malts
white
bread
cloying
sweet
yeast
and
hints
of
floral
vanilla
and
honey
buttress
some
faint
haylike
hop
notes
and
a
plastic
aftertaste
almost
evokes
stella
artois
in
terms
of
having
some
yeasty
character
but
nowhere
near
that
good
one
to
tick
off
the
list
but
glad
i
did
not
purchase
in
quantity
and
probably
would
not
sample
again
ok
beer
surprised
that
is
wasnt
skunked
green
bottle
import
pale
straw
color
thin
head
that
will
be
gone
before
you
can
get
the
first
sip
to
your
mouth
basically
taste
like
an
aal
with
a
bit
more
charactermaybe
not
as
good
as
i
thought
it
would
be
the
only
justice
in
this
beer
would
be
if
somewhere
in
rome
a
guy
is
sipping
a
high
life
and
that
he
spent
11
bucks
for
a
sixer
of
and
is
wondering
why
we
bother
exporting
a
very
mediocre
product
o
peroni
nastro
azzuro
is
absolutely
nothing
special
i
hate
to
say
it
but
this
brew
was
definitely
not
worth
my
time
or
money
perhaps
i
got
a
bad
batch
but
im
afraid
i
will
not
find
out
if
there
is
such
thing
as
a
good
batch
under
good
conscience
i
can
not
recommend
this
brew
to
my
beer
brothers
spend
your
money
on
something
else
my
mark
out
of
one
hundred
would
be
49
overall
you
are
not
missing
anything
if
you
dont
have
this
beer
not
a
bad
adjunct
lager
they
likely
havent
added
too
much
corn
i
found
that
this
italian
version
superior
to
the
one
in
colombia
overall
basic
but
not
offensive
overall
not
sure
which
euro
lager
stands
out
from
the
rest
of
them
but
this
one
is
similar
with
others
fingernail
thin
layer
of
white
foam
rests
on
top
pale
golden
colored
a
bit
of
lager
yeastwell
water
and
saltine
cracker
aroma
biscuity
malt
flavor
and
some
very
mild
buttering
hop
flavor
extremely
light
and
perhaps
a
touch
too
thin
and
crisp
on
the
palate
the
beer
does
look
great
outofthebottle
but
thats
pretty
much
it
it
was
mostly
a
spilled
beer
in
the
air
scent
with
a
hoppy
flavor
and
nothing
else
too
much
carbonation
for
my
liking
and
i
gave
it
some
sympathy
points
due
to
its
coloring
i
think
ive
had
peroni
offerings
before
but
this
one
isnt
one
of
their
topshelf
models
still
its
not
bad
as
per
se
easily
drinkable
but
will
not
become
one
of
my
choice
lagers
this
is
a
very
pleasant
wellbalanced
lager
with
a
nice
light
maltiness
and
tangy
hoppiness
that
balances
the
malt
and
makes
for
a
very
refeshing
drink
if
you
like
the
pale
lager
style
you
should
try
it
despite
the
negative
ratings
it
is
heads
and
shoulders
above
the
buds
and
millers
of
the
world
overall
an
enjoyable
beer
ive
been
drinking
for
years
sooo
try
it
not
bad
i
might
bump
the
rate
up
to
around
3
5
on
my
review
besides
its
got
a
groovy
looking
bottle
you
can
put
up
on
the
shelf
with
the
other
ones
youve
tried
i
dont
totally
see
the
appeal
here
this
is
moderately
better
than
the
standard
bmc
stuff
but
the
price
does
not
match
the
quality
and
to
be
honest
the
beer
is
pedestrian
regardless
of
its
price
pours
a
generic
clear
fizzy
gold
with
just
an
inch
of
rapidly
fading
white
head
i
usually
guzzle
these
from
the
bottle
though
an
abundance
of
pilsner
malts
cascades
the
nose
with
the
adjunct
malt
sweetness
and
metallic
aromas
as
well
bittering
hops
only
the
taste
matches
malt
forward
not
a
totally
corn
beer
but
far
closer
than
craft
offerings
mouthfeel
is
the
best
feature
here
this
one
really
goes
down
easy
is
only
a
little
filling
in
great
quantity
and
actually
refreshes
pretty
well
when
its
cold
the
lightness
and
clean
characteristics
are
appreciated
but
the
flavors
just
arent
bold
enough
to
hold
my
attention
if
this
was
cheaper
i
could
see
it
having
a
role
to
play
in
the
greater
beer
world
but
it
prices
itself
out
of
that
range
and
doesnt
back
it
up
with
taste
my
biggest
complaint
i
drank
a
lot
of
this
in
australia
always
borrowing
from
my
neighbors
outside
fridge
but
revisiting
it
just
has
not
had
the
same
level
of
satisfaction
for
me
not
something
id
likely
drink
again
average
at
best
for
me
this
is
nostalgia
remembering
days
in
italy
drinking
with
friends
on
rooftops
i
am
not
overwhelmed
but
not
underwhelmed
either
it
is
as
previously
stated
from
other
reviews
average
at
best
fortunately
after
brewing
my
own
and
being
introduced
to
a
number
of
awesome
brews
i
cannot
go
back
to
these
types
of
flavorless
standards
yet
i
can
respect
that
they
serve
a
role
and
function
in
the
beer
world
and
for
me
it
is
nostalgia
so
thank
you
peroni
overall
this
is
one
of
the
better
euro
pales
i
have
had
and
is
not
something
to
shy
away
from
within
that
style
that
being
said
overall
this
beer
is
pretty
boring
and
is
not
something
i
would
find
the
need
to
to
have
again
compared
to
the
other
euro
pale
i
recently
reviewed
stella
artois
this
one
is
below
that
one
in
most
categories
the
mouthfeel
and
finish
are
good
the
mouthfeel
has
this
malty
roundness
compared
to
other
poor
european
lager
options
not
that
lagers
are
the
issue
but
some
just
arent
on
par
lousy
beer
the
only
difference
between
this
and
a
budweiser
is
the
italian
name
and
the
lack
of
corn
sweetness
which
is
a
good
thing
perfect
beer
if
you
hate
beer
but
want
to
be
seen
drinking
something
seemingly
tasteful
ugly
urine
yellow
color
zero
lacing
or
retention
over
carbonated
no
lasting
head
faint
malty
sweetness
with
no
bitterness
or
aromas
other
than
grain
this
beer
is
a
poor
imitation
of
heinekin
or
stella
i
enjoyed
this
beer
but
it
was
not
fantastic
by
any
means
slightly
sweet
taste
and
but
pretty
decent
finish
i
liked
the
smell
not
sure
if
this
would
be
better
on
on
draft
or
what
i
dont
think
it
would
necessarily
be
improved
or
what
solid
gold
color
not
remarkable
but
reminds
me
of
a
trip
to
rome
a
good
alternative
to
wine
if
you
are
at
an
italian
restaurant
overall
inoffensive
if
only
because
theres
very
little
here
to
begin
with
best
before
date
is
close
to
2
and
a
half
months
past
so
this
is
a
candidate
for
rereview
o
meh
another
forgettable
euro
lager
what
we
have
here
is
just
another
euro
pale
lager
the
appearance
is
a
golden
yellow
color
and
very
clear
the
taste
is
somewhat
hoppy
can
be
a
bit
sour
but
overall
relatively
neutral
and
nothing
special
not
a
beer
id
drink
that
often
or
pick
before
heineken
o
this
beer
has
a
couple
of
good
qualities
such
as
its
appearance
and
mouthfeel
considering
its
style
but
the
skunkiness
in
the
aroma
and
taste
render
it
to
be
an
average
pale
lager
wow
thought
i
would
give
another
one
of
the
beers
i
picked
up
in
the
mix
six
a
review
to
be
honest
the
next
time
i
make
a
mix
six
i
am
checking
beer
advocate
instead
of
doing
it
blind
the
beer
is
pale
yellow
in
color
with
no
head
bready
flavor
corny
aroma
this
is
a
beer
i
would
not
try
again
this
beer
is
almost
neutral
nothing
overpowering
nothing
special
it
is
very
drinkable
and
i
would
drink
it
again
and
it
will
probably
be
my
beer
of
choice
the
next
time
i
hit
up
the
local
pizza
joint
give
it
a
shot
overall
these
euro
lagers
are
all
the
same
light
like
spring
water
heavy
on
corn
and
sunk
hops
little
revisit
value
overall
ahnothing
really
too
great
i
would
pass
on
this
if
i
were
you
nothing
like
an
unsettling
documentary
on
nuclear
weapons
paired
with
a
classic
peroni
amiright
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
pale
straw
topped
by
a
finger
of
shortlived
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
corn
wheat
light
flowers
and
dry
grass
hey
its
not
skunked
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
though
now
the
corn
is
in
charge
and
the
wheat
is
decidedly
funkier
the
body
is
light
with
a
moderate
carbonation
and
a
watery
feel
overall
a
fairly
inoffensive
beer
but
one
that
just
doesnt
taste
all
that
great
to
me
330

editaccording
to
the
label
it
does
have
some
corn
but
other
than
a
faint
smell
its
not
that
obvious
my
italian
amico
was
right
this
isnt
up
to
much
a
standard
macro
lager
with
little
flavour
and
even
less
character
probably
passable
on
a
hot
day
in

if
served

no

to
go
seek
it

o
nothing
inoffensive
about
this
beer
nothing
too
fancy
either
one
of
the
better
macro
epls
around
and
goes
great
with
pizza
or
just
on
a
hot
summer
day
this
beer
worsened
a
bit
as
a
the
drink
went
on
and
lost
some
of
its
fruity
character
became
a
bit
more
bitter
but
the
first
few
sips
were
really
nice
and
on
that
alone
i
would
personally
recommend
this
as
a
nice
entry
level
popular
lager
grainy
flavour
with
notes
of
corn
very
light
bitterness
i
can
see
why
its
a
top
seller
in
italy
for
the
similar
reason
that
bud
light
is
the
top
seller
in
the
us
light
on
the
flavours
and
not
offensive
and
easy
drinking
hardly
an
endorsement
by
moi
but
it
stands
to
reason
flavour
doesnt
seem
to
be
a
major
priority
of
the
average
beer
drinker
i
hope
saying
that
doesnt
make
me
come
across
as
a
beer
snob
as
thats
not
my
intention
not
a
good
beerpass
o
meh
olight
lager
with
little
compelling
flavor
body
or
balance
a
clear
light
yellow
beer
with
a
fizzy
white
head
that
settles
quickly
minimal
lacing
kind
of
generic
euro
lager
aroma
grainy
malt
slightly
fruity
floral
hops
in
the
background
flavor
is
pretty
similar
very
vaguely
skunky
with
a
lightly
sweet
pale
malt
flavor
and
the
hint
of
those
floral
hops
underneath
pretty
nondescript
but
also
fairly
inoffensive
totally
unremarkable
crisp
and
light
bodied
with
lively
carbonation
and
a
clean
dry
finish
decently
refreshing
also
fairly
watery
not
the
worst
of
the
bunch
but
nothing
special
either
pairs
well
served
ice
cold
with
pizza
no
need
to
drink
it
any
warmer
as
whatever
nuances
it
possesses
arent
worth
examining
o
the
beer
is
refreshing
and
sessionable
it
is
easy
to
drink
and
i
could
have
a
couple
of
these
but
there
is
nothing
that
really
stands
out
about
this
beer
notes
served
in
a
pilsener
glass
overall
not
a
beer
i
go
out
of
my
way
for
i
dont
quite
understand
why
this
beer
is
scored
so
poor
its
not
great
but
its
slightly
above
average
for
a
euro
lager
many
euro
lagers
suffer
from
skunk
but
i
dont
have
that
problem
with
peroni
kinda
bland
and
sweet
but
not
bad
pours
a
very
clear
straw
color
with
a
few
finger
frothy
bone
white
head
light
lacing
arome
is
pretty
damn
clean
with
only
that
slightest
smell
of
dirty
europe
slightly
sweet
taste
is
the
same
sweet
grainy
malt
dominates
light
hops
and
a
decent
pepperiness
gives
this
beer
an
edge
over
many
euro
lagers
feel
is
okay
but
could
maybe
use
a
little
more
carbonation
again
i
just
dont
see
this
as
the
disaster
that
most
see
it
as
hmm
final
thought
italy
is
not
well
know
for
its
brewing
and
i
can
see
why
this
one
falls
in
the
bad
import
lager
category
for
me
i
mean
its
drinkable
and
i
guess
if
i
was
in
europe
and
wanted
beer
yeah
this
would
be
ok
but
really
i
think
if
this
is
the
standard
in
italy
youre
better
off
sticking
to
wine
clear
pale
strawyellow
body
with
a
wisp
of
fizzy
white

aroma
of
grains
cabbagey
skunk
about
the

taste
vague
beerish

of
pale

husks
see
crappy

exist
in

not
just
the

thin

unnecessary
undrinkable
lots
of
good
italian
craft
beers
are
making
their
ways
to
the
states
lately
this
isnt
one
of
them
drinkability
its
a
very
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
with
bland
flavors
and
aromas
overall
a
great
dinner
beer
better
on
draft
overall
fairly
decent
pale
lager
for
what
it
is
i
honestly
enjoyed
this
a
bit
more
than
i
was
expecting
served
ice
cold
on
a
hot
day
with
lunch
it
was
quite
refreshing
lighter
medium
body
slightly
higher
carbonation
prickly
and
awfully
lingering
on
the
tongue
holy
crap
this
is
bad
an
unmitigated
trainwreck
of
poor
flavors
doused
in
skunk
id
take
a
bud
light
over
this
any
day
o
euro
pale
lager
what
can
say
nothing
bad
but
nothing
spectacular
mouthfeel
is
the
only
thing
about
the
beer
that
is
almost
worth
giving
it
a
second
chance
its
clean
that
is
all
drinkability
based
on
alcohol
content
this
beer
was
repeatable
but
i
probably
wouldnt
opt
to
have
another
unfortunately
this
was
the
only
beer
this
particular
italian
restaurant
had
available
i
chose
water
for
my
second
drink
it
sort
of
reminded
me
of
a
stella
with
the
skunk
added
and
skunk
isnt
my
favorite
flavor
overall
id
call
this
a
beer
of
very
modest
accomplishment
if
you
want
a
beverage
italians
do
well
stick
to
wine
o
its
not
far
off
for
the
style
but
also
nothing
special
as
a
beer
in
general
drinkability
i
could
not
finish
the
glass
it
was
a
big
disappointment
i
have
had
the
real
nastro
that
is
brewed
in
italy
and
although
im
not
a
massive
fan
it
was
beautiful
in
comparison
this
felt
like
a
slightly
more
wellrounded
vb
overall
a
not
too
bad
larger
nothing
out
standing
a
good
refreshing
hot
weather
beer
this
is
one
of
my
favourite
light
beers
when
poured
in
the
glass
it
gives
a
creamy
white
head
however
it
does
not
last
very
long
the
taste
is
like
most
other
light
lagers
without
the
bitter
aftertaste
is
a
great
beer
for
a
sunny
day
in
london
town
please
bring
it
to
lebanon
aroma
is
malty
with
some
hops
taste
is
mildly
malty
with
a
very
slight
bitter
hop
finish
and
dry
pours
a
golden
pale
clear
with
off
white
head
it
has
a
nice
aroma
of
hops
and
a
slightly
bitter
flavor
with
no
sweetness
it
is
a
nice
hop
that
is
used
i
guess
its
an
ok
pilsener
id
rather
think
of
this
one
as
a
thin
boring
almost
tasteless
beer
o
a
solid
euro
pale
lager
way
better
on
tap
than
in
the
bottle
i
would
take
this
over
bmc
any
day
o
for
its
style
its
alright
it
doesnt
knock
ones
socks
off
but
then
again
its
a
5
1
abv
beer
you
can
have
a
few
of
these
and
be
alright
on
the
bright
side
they
go
very
well
with
doritos
but
what
doesnt
until
next
time

refreshing

nice
and

aromatics
with

not

granny

high

and

refreshing
with

to
it
overall
this
one
is
actually
good
for
what
it
is
i
think
it
may
be
the
green
apple
i
am
getting
from
it
overall
a
crisp
clean
refreshing
beer
with
a
sour
bite
and
slightly
bitter
flavor
a
drinkable
beer
with
a
unique
flavor
profile
in
the
premium
american
lager
category
even
though
its
a
euro
beer
a
good
beer
at
a
fair
price
refreshing
and
fairly
smooth
good
for
large
parties
to
add
a
little
variety
to
the
mix
nice
carbonation
but
head
will
not
last
long
easy
to
drink
and
seems
to
taste
better
if
drinking
on
the
shores
of
italy
which
is
actually
the
first
time
i
had
tried
it
not
good
avoid
i
wanted
to
dog
this
one
as
just
lacking
anything
of
value
instead
this
just
a
very
bad
beer
but
not
an
insult
to
beer
not
terrible
when
it
comes
down
to
it
but
it
does
feel
watered
down
and
fizzy
to
me
too
much
so
not
offensive
like
some
of
the
popular
american
light
lagers
but
not
good
the
beer
appeared
a
pale
golden
color
with
noticeable
carbonation
following
to
the
top
of
the
beer
upon
the
pour
the
beer
quickly
produced
a
very
big
3
fingers
white
foamy
head
and
it
dissipated
and
quickly
as
it
was
produced
no
lacing
to
mention
the
aroma
of
the
beer
was
probably
the
best
part
of
the
beer
it
gave
off
a
nice
bready
and
toasted
malt
aroma
the
taste
of
the
beer
was
toasted
malts
but
was
clean
and
crisp
but
still
average
at
best
the
beer
was
light
but
very
easy
to
drink
i
was
finished
with
it
before
i
knew
it
and
probably
would
have
ordered
another
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
would
not
pick
up
a
six
pack
for
home
consumption
as
there
are
better
lagers
and
apas
out
there
this
beer
was
average
in
most
departments
it
smelled
better
than
it
tasted
with
good
herbal
and
hop
filled
aroma
it
was
a
very
light
color
with
champagne
like
carbonation
that
hung
around
the
head
was
fast
dissipating
and
white
the
taste
was
clean
and
toasty
but
really
quite
average
and
the
after
taste
wasnt
great
very
average
for
a
euro
pale
lager
the
mouthfeel
was
clean
and
the
aftertaste
not
bad
just
nothing
unique
worth
drinking
theres
nothing
fancy
to
this
beer
its
very
smooth
sits
very
light
in
the
mouth
and
goes
down
smooth
very
nice
beer
with
pizza
330ml
bottle
poured
into

one
little
finger
head
that
stayed
longer
than
expected
very
light
in

clear
with
a
few
bubbles
strong
industrial
artificial
smell
with
hints
of
corn
tasted
hints
of
wheat
sweet
with
bitter
finish
moderate
mouthfull
decent
beer
to
drink
with
an
italian
meal
but
not
enough
going
on
to
justify
the
high
price
o
meh
its
a
good
thirst
quencher
not
huge
on
interesting
flavours
but
a
good
refreshing
offering
especially
when
tucking
in
to
some
bruschetta
pours
very
very
pale
clear
yellow
very
short
head
that
dissapears
at
first
sip
absolutely
no
lacing
on
glass
not
much
to
smell
a
bit
ricy
taste
is
average
saved
by
exceptional
crispness
glad
i
only
purchased
one
bottle
from
the
local
pizzaria
this
is
a
typical
euro
pale
lager
that
does
not
pretend
to
be
more
than
what
it
is
a
clear
golden
appearance
with
high
carbonation
a
small
head
with
moderate
lacing
not
much
on
the
smell
the
taste
is
a
bit
grainy
with
a
hint
of
hops
mouthfeel
is
on
the
average
side
overall
a
decent
beer
for
a
summer
day
or
with
a
light
meal
goes
good
with
italian
food
peroni
i
was
at
an
italian
restaurant
the
other
evening
so
to
keep
in
with
the
theme
for
the
evening
i
did
order
a
peroni
it
poured
into
the
glass
with
a
clear
straw
colored
body
and
a
thin
white
head
very
subtle
aroma
but
nothing
special
the
peroni
kept
an
even
sweetness
throughout
with
just
the
right
touch
of
hops
to
keep
it
interesting
this
was
a
very
good
beer
for
what
ba
drinkers
would
call
a
light
beer
and
better
than
many
craft
brewers
do
with
this
style
typical
europian
lager
ouch
light
gold
in
appearance
with
the
smell
of
euro
beer
as
for
taste
well
we
have
had
better
will
drink
if
we
have
to
the
mouthfeel
is
average
and
does
clear
the
mouth
well
overall
this
it
a
2
5
beer
if
in
rome
we
would
drink
other
wise
we
stick
to
american
brew
o
overall
i
wasnt
too
impressed
with
this
beer
a
little
of
that
skunked
smell
and
taste
and
corn
wouldnt
seek
it
out
again
overall
this
isnt
a
great
beer
it
gets
the
job
done
without
being
offensive
but
i
wouldnt
pick
this
up
ever
again
it
isnt
really
all
that
great
o
a
good
euro
pale
for
outside
pasta
eating
appearance
is
straw
yellow
in
color
with
a
dissapating
crisp
head
smell
has
a
light
aroma
in
adjuncts
and
yeast
with
only
a
slight
skunk
note
taste
again
has
the
adjunct
light
malt
and
moderately
hopped
with
a
dry
bitter
in
the
end
mouthfeel
is
light
with
crisp
carbonation
not
bad
had
better
seasonable
and
refreshing
o
it
is
a
great
beer
not
really
it
is
pretty
bad
o
its
an
imported
macrobrew
what
can
you
really
expect
it
doesnt
really
offend
and
im
glad
because
the
meal
is
so
great
i
would
love
my
amatriciana
with
a
great
beer
but
im
at
least
happy
that
it
didnt
take
away
from
my
lunch
similar
to
a
stella
but
stella
is
a
bit
better
in
my
opinion
extremely
pale
color
a
very
transparent
gold
nose
classic
lager
with
a
touch
reminiscent
of
the
germanstyle
pilsener
the
mouth
is
very
easy
to
drink
you
feel
a
little
grassy
aftertaste
that
is
slightly
tangy
taste
of
a
beer
commercial
finally
uninteresting
o
havent
had
a
peroni
since
i
was
on
holiday
in
italy
with
the
old
ball
and
chain
7
years
ago
it
may
be
another
7
before
i
have
another
o
if
youre
in
florence
just
try
the
wine
things
that
ferment
taste
great
stick
with
the
ones
italy
is
good
at
taste
was
the
same
not
very
interesting
it
was
a
good
thirst
quencher
and
fit
for
the
food
this
is
a
decent
beer
not
one
id
rush
to
get
back
to
but
its
one
i
would
have
if
im
somewhere
without
craft
beer
it
was
actually
quite
refreshing
on
this
day
since
it
was
102
degrees
out
overall
tastes
like
an
italian
coors
light
nothing
special
oand
againaverage
epl
o
easy
drinker
not
what
i
would
call
blue
ribbon
but
has
the
edge
over
most
bmc
offerings
dr
you
could
quaff
it
down
at
frat
parties
sure
but
if
you
want
a
flavourful
beer
look
elsewhere
even
if
you
want
an
italian
beer
that
pairs
well
with
food
look
elsewhere
there
is
only
one
place
this
beer
belongs
the
shelf
that
said
its
very
affordable
for
the
quantity
maybe
itd
be
good
as
a
cooking
beer
for
frying
sausages
if
theres
no
stale
beer
leftover
from
a
party
before
o
certainly
not
terrible
but
its
all
around
just
average
its
easily
drinkable
but
its
also
so
mild
that
it
wont
appease
those
who
demand
some
flavour
typical
macro
lager
bottle
poured
into
a
pilsner
glass
half
a
finder
of
head
which
dissipated
quickly
light
yellow
colornot
impressed
smells
pretty
bland
nothing
of
note
tastes
like
an
ashtrayreally
not
good
one
of
the
worst
tasting
beers
ive
had
very
watery
mouthfeel
this
beer
is
not
good
at
all
and
i
wouldnt
have
it
again
i
will
be
going
to
italy
in
a
couple
of
weeks
so
i
will
probably
drink
more
of
this
being
there
and
i
can
say
that
it
is
not
a
punishment
overall
drinkability
ive
had
this
before
in
a
bottle
a
long
time
ago
and
i
remember
it
with
more
fondness
back
then
i
dont
remember
this
much
skunk
smell
upon
pouring
but
it
was
a
long
time
ago
went
good
with
the
calzone
i
had
but
after
awhile
i
found
it
a
mild
chore
to
drink
not
sure
id
want
to
have
another
in
an
evening
maybe
this
bottle
sat
out
in
the
light
too
long
before
getting
chilled
oh
well
not
every
beer
can
be
great
overall
i
certainly
woldnt
turn
one
down
if
offered
to
me
but
i
dont
think
ill
seek
this
one
out
again
premium
lager
is
a
misnomer
as
theres
nothing
premium
about
this
crap
its
just
crap
plain
and
simple
i
did
not
enjoy
this
experience
whatsoever
and
it
took
great
effort
to
choke
down
the
glass
fortunately
i
am
seasoned
with
a
great
deal
of
indian
wells
experience
so
i
succeeded
but
im
telling
you
the
whole
thing
was
like
a
man
vs
food
challenge
i
suffered
greatly
pours
a
clear
yellow
color
with
a
1
inch
white
head
that
fades
to
a
film
on
the
top
of
the
beer
random
small
spots
of
lacing
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
sweet
grain
and
a
light
fruit
aroma
taste
is
the
same
as
the
smell
with
a
light
fruity
flavor
coming
through
on
the
finish
this
beer
has
good
carbonation
with
a
bubbly
and
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
average
beer
but
it
washed
down
the
pizza
i
had
very
well
not
something
i
would
buy
on
its
own
though
o
a
decent
drinking
lager
sweeter
than
most
nothing
very
special
but
it
wasnt
offputting
color
was
darker
than
straw
but
lighter
than
golden
head
was
there
and
gone
in
the
flash
of
an
eye
never
to
return
no
lace
aroma
of
uncooked
grain
lots
of
carbonation
more
than
i
expected
even
from
a
lager
taste
is
mostly
malt
very
dry
with
some
cooked
corn
very
reminiscent
of
an
american
adjunct
lager
but
with
a
considerably
more
bitter
finish
light
body
its
hard
to
get
real
affectionate
about
this
stuff
but
the
kiss
of
hops
and
clean
flavors
should
buy
it
some
slight
respect
went
to
bertuchis
tonight
had
this
beer
because
it
was
the
pairing
recommendation
with
their
florentine
pizza
i
really
wish
i
had
not
drank
this
as
it
was
a
reminded
me
of
just
how
bad
beer
really
can
be
it
was
pale
urine
yellow
with
a
thin
head
had
a
noticeably
watery
taste
with
a
bitter
aftertaste
it
didnt
have
a
noticeable
aroma
the
glass
they
served
it
in
said
blue
moon
which
ironically
would
have
went
better
with
the
pizza
i
dont
think
id
give
this
one
a
second
try
drinkability
overall
this
beer
was
simple
yet
enjoyable
and
quite
refreshing
its
firm
hoppiness
would
make
it
pair
well
with
alot
of
food
choice
and
also
its
light
body
would
make
it
a
nice
summer
refresh
not
a
bad
beer
and
pretty
typical
of
the
euro
style
peroni
is
just
fine
i
liked
it
and
i
didnt
drink
it
numbingly
cold
and
id
have
it
again
under
the
circumstances
taste
is
equally
as
boring
my
first
comment
this
tastes
like
nothing
mouthfeel
is
light
and
watery
pretty
meh
poured
this
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
the
color
of
this
lager
was
light
yellow
very
clear
and
it
produced
a
nice
white
head
head
retention
was
average
the
aroma
of
the
beer
smelled
of
lemon
and
broccoli
the
body
was
light
and
the
mouthfeel
was
very
smooth
the
taste
of
the
beer
tasted
of
pepper
and
grain
with
a
sight
hint
of
honey
sweetness
i
first
tried
this
a
few
years
back
in
rome
it
was
on
draft
and
i
remember
it
being
better
then
what
i
got
from
this
bottle
im
not
a
big
fan
there
is
just
not
much
to
it
maybe
there
are
two
versions
of
this
a
crappy
american
version
and
then
the
real
thing
mamma
mia
final
grade
3
04
a
c
pours
a
small
one
finger
white
head
that
is
already
almost
gone
the
body
is
completely
see
through
yellow
in
color
looks
pretty
horrible
to
me
i
have
no
idea
how
this
beer
gets
a
c
because
it
looks
like
a
adjunct
lager
to
me
actually
it
looks
worse
than
some
adjunct
lagers
its
not
even
giving
me
any
lacing
the
smell
is
just
full
of
skunk
maybe
a
little
bit
of
malt
underneath
that
and
then
some
hop
underneath
that
its
just
so
hard
to
detect
anything
when
the
smell
of
skunk
is
just
blasting
you
in
the
face
the
smell
really
isnt
that
great
i
mean
it
smells
like
its
got
some
girth
to
it
but
its
just
all
fd
up
by
all
the
skunk
well
see
how
this
beer
tastes
but
i
dont
have
too
much
hope
god
the
flavor
is
horrible
it
taste
like
water
mixed
with
alcohol
and
skunk
i
mean
its
almost
undrinkable
i
guess
its
crisp
i
mean
im
trying
to
find
good
things
to
say
about
it
i
mean
i
guess
it
has
more
flavor
than
a
bud
but
its
not
a
good
flavor
i
really
remember
liking
this
beer
more
but
this
this
beer
is
horrible
btw
if
anyone
cared
i
am
getting
0
lacing
out
of
this
beer
i
mean
i
can
drink
it
its
beer
i
wont
hate
drinking
it
but
this
is
one
of
the
last
beers
i
would
prefer
to
drink
out
of
all
of
the
beers
out
there
in
the
world
i
hate
to
say
all
of
this
because
im
italian
i
want
to
like
this
beer
its
got
a
cool
label
but
man
mouthfeel
is
bad
drinkability
is
bad
i
dont
know
what
else
to
say
im
shocked
at
how
bad
this
beer
is
i
really
am
pass
next
time
except
i
wont
because
its
generally
the
most
appelaing
on
limited
menus
not
exactly
my
style
but
i
figured
what
the
hell
its
fun
to
venture
out
of
your
style
of
choice
every
once
in
a
while
i
can
a
smell
of
grass
like
youre
out
in
the
middle
of
a
field
on
a
morning
after
it
rained
waiting
for
the
sunrise
when
i
drink
some
i
get
no
hop
bombs
no
alcohol
burn
just
a
nice
refreshing
beer
which
is
what
im
not
used
to
with
all
the
stouts
i
drink
this
beer
seems
like
it
would
be
good
with
some
bbq
maybe
some
grilled
chicken
and
salad
during
the
summer
when
its
hot
at
night
im
definitely
getting
a
lager
and
sitting
on
the
back
porch
and
knocking
a
few
of
these
back
peroni
pours
a
crystal
clear
lightish
yellow
with
a
somewhat
foamy
head
that
fades
quickly
the
aroma
is
mild
slightly
malty
and
grainy
with
an
odd
almost
vinous
quality
in
the
background
the
flavor
is
grainy
husky
malt
with
a
hint
of
sweetness
there
is
a
moderate
bitterness
but
no
hop
flavor
there
is
just
a
hint
of
sulfur
but
it
might
be
my
imagination
in
the
finish
there
is
a
harsh
mead
like
quality
the
better
half
and
i
attended
a
wonderful
comedy
show
last
evening
at
a
neat
italian
reastaurant
in
melrose
park
il
chuck
salvo
did
a
tremendous
job
and
made
us
laugh
with
ease
in
addition
we
were
with
a
great
group
of
friends
the
italian
restaurant
did
have
a
poor
beer
selection
though
however
i
did
enjoy
the
peronis
in
the
bottle
they
went
with
our
meal
just
fine
as
with
most
euro
beer
it
was
seemingly
a
classic
pilsner
style
beer
clear
bubbly
color
with
white
foam
head
grainy
nose
and
a
crisp
clear
taste
i
could
certainly
do
a
session
with
this
stuff
proved
that
last
night
and
when
i
say
session
it
means
the
mouthfeel
was
good
enough
overall
not
a
bad
lager
but
its
just
so
weak
and
mild
i
didnt
want
more
of
it
im
glad
i
had
this
on
tap
as
it
comes
in
a
green
bottle
which
we
all
know
can
be
iffy
and
while
i
would
normally
say
to
grab
one
and
see
please
dont
as
its
just
so
mild
pretty
good
beer
once
out
of
the
can
and
into
the
glass
it
formed
a
thick
foamy
head
13
of
its
volume
its
a
very
fresh
tasting
beer
and
has
some
nice
corn
notes
also
has
a
good
amount
of
malt
to
keep
the
flavor
alive
balanced
by
just
enough
hops

abv
so
its
right
where
a
great
euro
lager
needs
to
be
not
boozy
and
not
boring
i
highly
recommend
this
brew
came
out
a
clear
golden
yellow
with
a
lot
of
bubbles
a
descent
amount
of
head
about
two
fingers
worth
thick
but
dissipated
quickly
to
barely
any
lace
the
aroma
was
all
grassy
and
a
very
sour
lemon
and
wet
straw
a
faintly
citrus
and
dirty
hop
aroma
taste
was
very
light
and
bubbly
with
a
lot
of
straw
and
the
sour
lemon
from
the
aroma
a
very
dry
and
crisp
finish
with
some
of
the
citrus
hop
but
more
of
the
wet
grass
sourbitter
dryness
overall
just
a
touch
below
good
but
definitely
above
average
a
goto
beer
if
you
want
something
easily
drinkable
and
yet
subtly
complex
love
it
a
super
light
crisp
beer
i
had
at
sals
pizza
in
new
york
city
it
was
a
beer
that
i
had
not
seen
a
lot
of
of
late
so
i
thought
id
give
it
a
try
i
must
admit
i
drank
it
straight
out
of
the
bottle
which
is
good
to
do
every
now
and
again
i
think
on
the
right
day
with
the
right
food
itd
be
a
fair
beer
like
a
hot
summer
day
doing
some
yard
work
the
beer
seemed
lighter
than
miller
or
bud
light
to
me
overall
as
my
score
indicates
i
wouldnt
recommend
this
beer
or
try
it
again
anytime
soon
upon
opening
the
bottle
i
can
immediately
smell
that
skunky
mustiness
of
a
typical
import
lager
there
is
just
no
mistaking
it
i
was
giving
this
beer
a
try
because
it
was
the
only
interesting
beer
being
offered
at
a
small
italian
restaurant
i
was
checking
out
with
some
friends
and
family
color
was
very
pale
and
straw
colored
slight
white
head
that
seemed
to
hang
around
the
rim
longer
than
i
expected
tastewise
this
beer
is
not
impressive
it
reminded
me
of
a
heineken
that
had
been
sitting
around
in
someones
refrigerator
a
bit
too
long
it
also
seemed
a
bit
too
carbonated
but
maybe
its
supposed
to
be
that
way
either
way
i
wont
be
drinking
it
again
unless
i
have
very
few
other
options
skunky
as
skunky
gets
thus
brew
is
not
pleasing
on
the
nose
at
all
i
odered
this
once
and
never
again
i
didnt
mind
that
it
was
on
the
same
basis
as
most
lagers
i
still
wanted
to
try
it
through
the
whole
thing
i
had
that
aroma
attacking
my
nose
and
it
made
it
hard
to
enjoy
i
had
to
drink
it
asap
just
to
order
something
different
d
a
decent
pale
lager
nothing
particularly
unique
about
it
but
its
enjoyable
nonetheless
in
the
end
i
think
this
is
not
best
beer
ever
but
for
a
euro
lager
it
is
one
of
my
favorites
give
it
a
try
viva
la
italia
really
not
a
good
lager
peroni
could
be
worse
it
could
also
be
a
lot
better
no
head
pale
straw
body
light
floral
scent
very
hoppy
taste
with
hints
of
wheat
and
a
skunky
alcoholic
finish
light
mouthfeel
not
quite
refreshing
by
itself
but
goes
well
when
paired
with
salmon
since
its
sharp
enough
to
cut
through
the
oil
but
not
overbearing
in
hoppiness
would
not
go
out
of
my
way
to
grab
another
bottle
unless
selection
was
limited
and
it
was
part
of
a
food
pairing
overall
this
is
an
easy
to
drink
but
unimpressive
beer
first
italian
beer
and
hope
there
are
better
ones
then
this
so
far
their
wine
is
a
lot
better
d
if
you
drink
it
quick
this
could
be
alright
but
even
still
im
fine
without
having
this
again
d
pretty
drinkable
but
nothing
id
go
out
of
my
way
for
if
i
want
a
pale
lager
ill
reach
for
a
pilsner
urquel
or
a
sam
adams
noble
pils
over
this
any
day
of
the
week
cheers
usually
drank
at
italian
restaurant
if
i
do
not
opt
for
wine
in
tall
chilled
glass
peroni
has
a
thick
white
head
and
a
very
clear
deep
golden
appearance
with
lots
of
carbonation
the
aroma
is
slight
but
some
barley
malt
can
be
picked
up
with
a
strong
sniff
the
taste
is
delicious
and
it
does
have
a
good
hop
and
barley
malt
balance
as
per
the
description
i
enjoyed
the
fullbodied
beer
taste
and
mouthfeel
and
found
it
to
be
refreshing
also
it
is
not
as
dry
as
american
lagers
notes
ive
had
peroni
before
and
i
dont
remember
it
being
this
bad
im
not
sure
if
this
bottle
was
particularly
light
struck
or
what
but
it
was
almost
undrinkable
im
sure
drinking
from
a
glass
rather
than
the
bottle
also
has
something
to
do
with
the
heightened
awareness
of
offflavors
an
extremely
average
drink
i
would
not
have
it
on
its
own
but
it
goes
well
with
a
meal
d
this
has
more
of
a
light
pilsener
beer
taste
not
much
flavor
in
the
beer
besides
some
greenbottle
beer
taste
and
grains
definitely
something
you
can
drink
a
few
of
but
not
something
i
would
routinely
pick
if
i
had
limited
choices
at
an
italian
restaurant
i
would
get
this
verdict
not
terrible
but
not
very
interesting
one
of
the
better
pale
beers
i
have
had
since
my
reviews
began
some
positive
characteristics
in
the
taste
and
the
mouthfeel
but
doesnt
look
that
great
and
smell
is
very
off
borderline
average

and
more

a
good

cleanser
beer
d
this
is
a
beer
you
could
consume
without
having
to
worry
about
filling
up
pours
out
a
clear
golden
watery
looking
hue
with
a
thin
bubbly
white
head
that
diminishes
to
a
faint
carb
presence
on
top
of
the
beer
within
minutes
smell
is
of
mild
hops
faintly
sweet
malts
and
some
ragweed
aroma
that
gives
off
a
distinct
skunky
characteristic
taste
is
slightly
sweet
from
the
malts
with
distinct
grain
and
hay
characteristics
noted
at
first
followed
by
a
very
light
metallic
flavor
which
quickly
gives
way
to
some
decent
bitterness
leaving
a
fairly
desirable
hoppiness
on
the
tongue
mouthfeel
is
light
watery
and
overly
carbonated
with
a
dry
and
bready
feel
to
it
but
it
seems
to
suit
the
taste
of
this
beer
fairly
well
not
a
bad
beer
the
light
and
watery
feel
combined
with
the
mild
flavors
and
light
sweetness
combine
to
give
an
easy
drinking
euro
pale
lager
just
put
aside
the
skunkiness
and
this
ones
an
easy
drinker
rjt
my
suggesion
is
zatec
czech
lager
of
the
bunch
if
its
on
the
menu
it
is
better
than
the
big
brands
but
not
one
you
make
an
effort
to
drink
its
not
an
exceptional
beer
but
a
good
option
at
places
with
a
standard
beer
selection
just
about
every
bogstandard
italian
restaraunt
will
have
these
to
go
along
with
the
bmc
and
its
the
best
choice
in
those
situations
dgets
worse
as
it
goes
on
it
obtains
an
undesirable
bitterness
to
it
dsomewhat
off
the
longer
i
drink
it
would
likely
not
have
again
if
given
a
choice
d
this
is
your
run
of
the
mill
macro
lager
nothing
special
here
drinkability
would
have
been
a
lot
better
if
i
liked
the
taste
a
little
more
drinkability
very
high
drinkability
this
beer
would
be
great
with
just
about
any
food
lighter
body
with
some
complexity
and
a
crisp
citrus
pop
make
this
beer
a
winner
great
for
the
style
12
oz
bottle
aroma

with

the
same

nothing
really
to
look
at
palate
watery
overall
who
would
need
to
import
this
beer
half
a
way
around
the
world
i
would
have
been
better
off
by
ordering
heineken
pours
a
slightlydarkened
straw
yellow
color
with
plenty
of
visible
carbonation
and
somewhat
of
a
white
head
good
lacing
going
down
the
nose
is
actually
slightly
hoppy
with
a
strong
grain
character
the
taste
is
all
grain
although
no
corn
which
is
always
a
nice
touch
light
feel
with
crisp
carbonation
not
too
bad
though
not
that
good
either
kinda
pungent
reminds
me
a
bit
of
an
american
ice
macro
d
simple
and
inoffensive
but
certainly
not
quantifiably
good
poured
a
huge
head
which
slowly
faded
to
1
straw
yellow
in
color
slightest
aroma
of
skunking
but
what
do
you
expect
from
an
import
across
the
pond
which
was
bottled
in
green
glass
on
a
positive
note
i
have
to
say
it
was
a
fairly
strong
lager
with
a
lasting
crispness
and
a
mild
sweetness
were
it
to
be
a
fresh
sample
in
italy
id
exect
it
to
score
better
enjoyable
while
note
being
complex
value
honestly
this
beer
is
better
than
heiney
at
about
the
same
price
id
go
with
this
one
every
time
its
not
horrible
not
great
i
think
its
probably
better
in
bottle
where
its
at
least
clean
bland
and
drinkable
this
is
rather
tasteless
and
very
forgettable
pours
clear
gold
with
a
very
weak
head
with
pretty
terrible
lacing
and
smells
like
nothing
and
more
nothing
well
nothing
substantial
anyway
carbonation
is
good
but
thats
the
only
positive
thing
i
find
tastes
like
metal
and
the
aftertaste
is
not
exactly
pleasant
i
think
on
a
hot
day
it
would
be
ok
with
a
kick
of
sprite
or
something
as
a
radler
but
as
a
beer
alone
its
not
exactly
the
best
out
there
drinkability
very
boring
really
only
useful
on
a
hot
day
not
bad
at
all
it
is
a
good
lager
it
is
smooth
and
well
balanced
pours
an
light
yellow
colour
with
bubbly
head
that
settles
down
to
almost
nothing
within
a
few
seconds
some
spots
of
lacing
on
the
glass
smells
of
grain
and
not
much
else
flavour
is
just
weak
almost
nothing
going
on
i
thought
i
remembered
a
little
bit
more
hop
bitterness
but
i
could
just
have
a
bad
memory
carbonation
is
a
bit
too
aggressive
for
me
but
not
bad
i
dont
want
to
drink
another
one
for
a
long
time
drinkability
pretty
standard
macro
lager
here
a
little
bit
hoppier
than
most
but
still
nothing
great
for
the
price
youd
pay
for
this
you
could
get
much
much
better
beers
the
beer
has
a
beautiful
golden
honey
color
with
a
white
head
that
has
little
retention
the
tiny
carbonation
bubbles
dissipate
after
a
few
minutes
light
sweet
smell
with
a
little
hop
aroma
almost
like
wet
grass
the
taste
has
a
slight
bitter
earthy
taste
with
a
corn
sweetness
the
mouthfeel
consists
of
a
light
smooth
body
with
little
carbonation
while
the
beer
is
not
amazing
it
is
decent
for
its
class
however
it
probably
would
be
better
classified
as
an
american
adjunct
lager
the
smell
wasnt
to
great
but
the
taste
made
up
for
it
thankfully
it
tastes
a
little
better
than
it
smells
again
a
character
slightly
stronger
than
usual
for
a
macro
lager
at
first
though
it
tends
to
the
sulphurymetallic
side
awith
a
metallicy
bitter
finish
before
just
becoming
more
bland
and
characterless
there
really
was
not
a
lot
of
taste
to
this
beer
a
little
bit
of
skunky
bitterness
from
a
noncomplex
beer
not
very
drinkable
d
excellent
drinkability
could
down
these
all
night
very
nice
pale
euro
lager
certainly
a
solid
beer
definitely
sessionable
but
thats
all
if
you
are
in
the
mood
for
a
night
cap
i
recommend
you
grab
a
different
beer
from
the
fridge
but
i
cant
say
that
it
would
be
a
bad
idea
to
keep
this
one
around
it
just
might
go
well
with
pizza
drinkability
its
perfectly
drinkable
to
cut
heavygreasy
italian
food
otherwise
id
avoid
cheers
good
for
its
style
excellent
for
washing
down
food
the
caps
and
appearance
are
a
lot
better
than
the
actual
beer
the
taste
is
slightly
flat
and
bitter
not
exactly
watered
down
but
nothing
distinguishable
about
it
very
carbonated
from
what
i
remember
not
my
taste
but
not
an
awful
beer
by
any
means
d
a
great
beer
for
100
degrees
in
the
shade
or
scrubbin
your
palate
after
a
greasy
italian
sausage
but
generally
too
light
to
be
considered
drinkable
for
more
than
1
d
rink
an
average
beer
in
my
books
reminds
me
of
miller
high
life
light
and
decent
for
the
summer
months
poured
into
a
pint
glass
a
pale
yellow
with
a
one
finger
head
which
fell
to
a
slight
film
after
a
minute
medium
carbonation
an
uneventful
brew
smells
of
sour
grapes
but
not
horrible
slightly
bitter
taste
but
easy
going
down
a
bit
more
kick
than
your
average
american
domestic
i
dont
want
to
be
overly
critical
but
the
only
time
i
think
i
would
ever
consider
having
another
one
of
these
would
be
at
an
italian
restaurant
with
a
heavy
pasta
meal
otherwise
it
is
too
overpriced
and
you
could
find
something
of
equal
or
better
quality
for
2
dollars
cheaper
per
sixer
overall
this
is
another
beer
that
i
was
not
a
fan
of
stateside
but
that
is
infinitely
more
palatable
close
to
the
source
i
shudder
to
think
what
those
outside
of
the
u
s
think
about
our
bmc
products
anyways
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
but
its
not
worth
seeking
out
either
m
not
very
pleasant
due
to
the
thin
flavor
and
end
bitterness
d
i
would
say
this
is
highly
drinkable
if
all
you
are
looking
for
is
to
get
drunk
otherwise
its
a
dissapointment
in
the
flavor
and
aroma
categories
that
makes
me
not
want
to
drink
this
its
just
another
fizzy
yellow
beer
beer
is
light
in
body
and
grainy
its
oddly
bitter
from
a
tannic
astringency
not
horrible
but
its
not
a
repeat
just
another
light
lager
without
a
second
thought
to
it
pours
a
piss
yellow
perfect
clarity
with
a
big
foamy
head
that
recedes
to
nothing
withing
seconds
really
dissapointing
smell
is
sorta
like
a
munich
helles
lager
with
a
hint
of
skunkyness
taste
is
bland
and
off
centered
from
what
i
would
expect
from
this
style
its
got
a
tiny
hop
bite
to
offset
the
lack
of
malt
this
has
these
beers
are
becomming
almost
like
a
beer
mix
style
where
its
carbonated
water
booze
and
yellow
coloring
really
no
flavor
here
other
than
a
wet
sock
skunky
taste
mouthfeel
is
weird
because
its
so
carbonated
but
there
is
no
head
and
no
bubbles
playing
around
really
this
is
just
thin
drinkability
is
below
average
just
because
its
not
the
best
tasting
beer
in
this
style
its
ok
and
when
it
warms
it
blows
so
really
this
isnt
even
a
hot
summer
days
beer
to
drink
drink
this
between
april
and
october
if
you
live
in
the
northeast

was
the
surprise
of
the
night
and
i
will
reach
for
it
in
future
when
im
looking
for
a
session
lager
an
underrated
beer
imho
but
extended
with
very
acceptable
bitterness
d
not
something
to
seek
out
necessarily
but
not
completely
unworthy
either
just
okay
a
very
modest
beer
birra
superiore
must
be
over
water
drinkability
an
okay
euro
lager
that
really
needs
more
dryness
or
crispness
to
compete
against
the
better
ones
there
is
simply
no
reason
that
beer
should
be
removed
from
that
context
the
staple
of
the
roman
diet
after
all
was
barley
unlike
a
vintage
chianti
or
montepulciano
peroni
tastes
only
of
industry
hegemonic
calculative
efficiencycrazed
economies
of
scale
and
manipulative
marketing
and
crass
commercialism
and
that
really
is
all
it
is
d
low
just
avoid
it
per
favore
drinkability
nothing
to
get
excited
about
but
not
too
bad
either
this
beer
is
uninspiring
and
unoffensive
goes
well
with
italian
food
though
d
very
drinkable
mostly
because
of
the
nice
crispness
and
feel
not
so
much
from
the
taste
crystal
clear
light
straw
yellow
soapy
white

and
quickly
dissipated

a
maltiness
in
the
background

with

turned
lemony
towards
the
end
light
malt
and
veggies
slightly
metallic
finish
light
bodied
average
carbonation
that
felt
a
bit
coarse
dry
its
light
mostly
inoffensive
and
easy
to
drink
im
not
fond
of
the
hops
veggies
and
metallic
character
though
so
its
not
something
id
go
back
to
i
have
to
say
as
fizzy
yellow
beers
go
nongerman
styles
anyway
i
prefer
the
euro
pale
lagers
to
the
american
adjunct
lagers
and
peroni
is
no
exception
overall
an
underrated
european
lager
a
bit
more
expensive
than
stella
and
heineken
based
on
what
i
know
but
definitely
worst
the
extra
few
cents
then
again
there
are
good
american
lagers
as
well
pours
a
clear
yellow
golden
color
with
large
white
head
and
spare
lacing
lots
of
fizzy
carbonation
light
body
and
thin
texture
lemon
zesty
hints
other
then
that
not
much
else
to
it
did
not
enjoy
at
all
would
never
drink
again
so
far
ive
had
three
beers
strsight
from
italy
and
ive
hated
everyone
d
first
and
only
time
having
this
one
i
hope
d
you
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
but
i
wouldnt
want
to
the
taste
isnt
all
that
stellar
and
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
sticky
at
times
i
would
definitely
drink
this
again
if
offered
its
a
good
well
rounded
beer
but
not
exceptional
overall
a
likely
prototypical
example
of
when
the
greenbottle
lightstrike
fairy
visits
an
unpleasantly
offseeming
edgy
eurolager
if
you
see
this
as
the
best
option
at
an
italian
or
any
other
restaurant
for
that
matter
make
sure
that
its
the
canned
version
or
just
ask
for
the
wine
list
d
impress
your
tap
the
rockies
clear
golden
lager
with
very
thin
fine
white
head
a
crisp
lager
aroma
instantly
forgettable
taste
is
only
a
poor
hop
bitterness
although
i
thought
there
might
have
been
a
slight
apple
taste
though
i
couldnt
quite
find
it
again
it
wasnt
completely
unpleasant
until
swallowing
high
carbonation
puts
this
on
par
with
a
pale
lager
a
dry
bitter
finish
makes
this
neither
refreshing
or
very
pairable
with
the
food
i
was
eating
but
hey
at
least
it
was
only
8
for
a
huge
glass
sarcastic
i
guess
i
cant
say
it
was
completely
awful
because
i
did
finish
it
only
that
i
dont
want
another
one
drinkability
would
drink
again
just
a
normal
lager
beer
like
heineken
dont
overthink
this
just
a
clean
light
lager
drink
repeat
d
low
alcohol
mild
flavors
light
feel
easy
on
the
stomach
and
the
tastebuds
goes
well
with
most
foods
not
in
a
complimentary
way
but
in
that
it
stays
out
of
the
way
in
short
good
drinkability
but
why
pay
the
import
price
for
this
when
theres
probably
a
domestic
that
has
the
same
qualities
its
good
for
downing
a
few
over
some
pizza
or
your
favorite
italian
dish
but
do
note
that
there
are
better
options
if
you
are
craving
a
beer
and
your
only
other
choices
are
bmc
products
this
will
be
the
better
pick
for
sure
not
exciting
as
far
as
taste
goes
but
very
drinkable
and
easy
to
put
down
could
drink
these
all
night
and
i
have
done
so
when
out
at
an
italian
restaurants
this
beer
goes
nice
with
italian
food
or
maybe
thats
just
my
perception
since
ive
had
it
so
often
over
the
years
at
a
lot
of
italian
restaurants
mixing
with
the
italian
food
might
also
be
elevating
the
score
d
i
would
careless
if
i
ever
had
one
of
these
again
in
life
i
had
this
beer
at
some
goodbye
party
for
a
friend
it
poured
a
pee
yellow
with
some
fizzy
fast
disolving
head
the
smell
and
taste
was
like
if
a
skunk
sprayed
and
pissed
on
a
bale
of
hay
i
was
not
impressed
with
the
mouthfeel
it
was
too
watery
to
my
liking
and
this
is
unthinkableundrinkable
it
turns
out
that
my
local
epl
river
horse
lager
is
far
more
drinkable
than
all
the
epls
ive
had
try
it
just
dont
pay
for
it
may
be
better
with
a
hot
sun
d
not
impressed
i
wont
be
ordering
this
again

overall
a

better
before
imported
d
ok
again
for
what
it
is
drinkability
its
faulty
and
unenjoyable
as
so
many
of
these
lagers
often
are
more
nasty
than
nastro
pretty
drinkable
wouldnt
be
hard
to
put
away
a
few
of
these
one
of
the
most
forgettable
and
non
offensive
beers
that
i
have
had
its
like
water

this
oddly
glowing

it
doesnt
really
last

to
admire

is

middling

just
simple
bready

and
a
very
weak
breeze
of
noble
hop
pepper
same
goes
for
the
flavor
mild
pale
malt
with
an
oddly
sour
tinge
that
doesnt
gel
well
with
the
hops
which
are
fairly
strong
in
their
bitterness
but
weak
in
their
flavor
lingeringly
sourbitter
in
the
bonedry
finish
very
fizzy
even
for
the
style
so
a
good
palate
cleanser
not
bad
really
but
a
far
cry
from
what
is
being
produced
at
some
of
italys
small
independent
breweries
overall
its
not
all
bad
drinkable
refreshing
and
a
good
everyday
food
beer
drinkability
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
d
i
have
to
give
this
one
low
ranks
for
drinkability
one
expects
a
light
lager
such
as
this
to
go
down
smoothly
and
this
one
does
have
decent
mouthfeel
and
light
body
but
there
is
a
strong
unpleasantness
to
the
taste
and
a
bitter
lingering
feeling
as
of
having
chewed
on
bitter
bad
walnuts
that
makes
each
sip
harder
to
take
than
the
last
i
finished
the
bottle
but
was
tempted
to
drainpour
by
the
end
and
i
certainly
do
not
want
another
one
overall
it
is
what
it
is
italys
corona
italys
molson
italys
heineken
you
get
it
overall
this
is
not
a
bad
example
of
the
style
you
cant
expect
it
to
be
great
but
for
what
it
is
its
all
right
you
could
easily
have
a
couple
of
these
in
a
less
pretentious
setting
again
not
a
great
complex
beer
but
worthy
of
being
had
when
not
a
lot
is
available
peroni
is
one
of
those
beers
you
get
in
many
types
of
places
nastro
azzuro
comes
in
a
green
bottle
as
you
may
have
guessed
and
taste
wise
it
is
pretty
plain
lager
with
no
remarkable
features
it
is
possible
to
drink
a
fair
few
but
it
gets
less
and
less
desirable
with
each
bottle
in
general
id
say
peroni
is
quite
a
poor
lager
choice
and
often
overpriced
high
marks
for
drinkability
whatever
the
italian
term
for
drinkability
is
i
bet
thats
their
marketing
slogan
my
major
gripe
is
the
overcarbonation
some
might
find
this
crisp
and
refreshing
but
it
was
a
little
too
much
fizz
for
my
liking
not
a
bad
brew
but
not
highly
recommended
d
extremely
carbonated
beer
but
in
no
sense
is
offensive
or
makes
difficult
to
take
good
italian
beer
par
for
the
course
tastes
mostly
like
a
macro
with
a
bit
more
hops
to
it
nothing
to
make
me
try
it
again
this
is
a
smooth
easy
going
lager
from
italy
it
is
a
great
summer
refresher
much
better
than
your
average
macro
pours
golden
with
a
minimal
head
albeit
with
a
steady
stream
of
bubbles
rising
upward
smells
a
little
skunked
although
there
is
a
strong
herbal
note
that
comes
right
through
the
taste
is
clean
and
crisp
nothing
much
happening
except
a
pleasant
sweetness
that
lingers
on
it
is
thin
on
the
palate
just
optimal
fizz
quite
right
for
easy
drinking
definitely
worth
your
time
drinkability
average
nothing
to
spectacular
ab
out
this
beer
ill
stick
to
an
american
when
in
rome
uh
find
some
craft
beer
to
drink
this
euro
lager
has
gone
from
decent
to
almost
undrinkable
over
the
past
several
years
our
recommendation
is
to
avoid
this
beer
i
got
this
from
my
neighbor
when
i
helped
him
carry
a
matress
upstairs
i
got
screwed
i
dont
know
how
long
it
was
in
his
fridge
long
enough
to
be
the
single
skunkiest
beer
in
the
history
of
the
world
looks
very
pale
yellow
fizzy
carbonation
no
head
i
can
smell
the
skunk
already
i
dont
mean
to
overstate
it
but
this
really
is
the
skunkiest
beer
i
have
ever
come
across
you
can
imagine
what
it
tasted
like
i
know
some
people
enjoy
a
little
skunk
like
heineken
becks
ect
i
cant
imagine
that
antything
is
intentionally
this
bad
so
that
means
that
it
is
from
the
light
getting
through
the
green
bottles
so
why
use
green
bottles
and
not
brown
or
cans
i
dont
know
i
do
know
ralph
owes
me
another
beer
to
make
up
for
this
overall
i
find
this
to
be
slightly
better
than
the
average
heineken
stella
grolsch
etc
euro
lager
it
is
still
fairly
boring
full
of
defects
skunked
etc
but
out
of
the
groups
of
euro
lagers
this
is
one
of
the
slightly
more
interesting
ones
at
least
this
one
is
a
little
more
clean
than
the
others
poured
into
a
pint
glass
it
forms
a
few
mm
of
white
head
that
leaves
little
lacing
the
color
is
clear
yellow
the
aroma
is
sweetly
citrus
with
light
hops
the
taste
is
on
the
dry
side
with
mild
hops
and
malt
mouthfeel
is
good
with
moderate
carbonation
its
a
very
drinkable
brew
one
of
the
better
lagers
even
tho
it
comes
up
to
a
c
i
still
like
this
beer
c
just
reflects
that
there
are
other
offerings
that
are
better
and
some
that
are
not
overall
one
of
the
better
euro
pale
lagers
but
is
a
bit
pricey
for
what
it
is
drinkable
not
really
impressive
d
a
euro
lager
i
probably
wont
ever
have
again
but
its
not
godawful
just
lacking
in
every
regard
nothing
about
it
stands
out
if
its
skunked
its
not
too
bad
for
being
skunked
thats
for
sure
this
beer
reminded
me
of
a
higher
quality
cleaner
version
of
heineken
it
is
a
drinkable
clean
lager
that
tastes
fairly
standard
with
nothing
against
it
and
nothing
exceptional
about
it
i
would
buy
it
again
if
it
were
cheap
but
for
a
european
import
lager
there
are
better
choices
d
easy
to
drink
but
not
much
else
to
suggest
it
except
the
setting
of
a
beautfiul
night
at
the
piazza
maggiore
on
a
saturday
night
with
friends
pale
straw
with
a
wispy
white
head
the
disappears
so
quickly
you
might
question
whether
it
existed
in
the
first
place
it
smells
grainy
and
slightly
sweet
it
has
a
sweet
grain
flavour
with
just
a
kiss
of
grassy
hop
character
very
mild
bitterness
it
feels
light
and
effervescent
in
the
mouth
which
works
in
this
beers
favour
thirst
quenching
and
quaffable
d
drinkable
because
it
is
light
and
i
could
have
many
but
i
am
not
too
fond
of
whatever
the
aftertaste
is
that
i
am
getting
had
this
at
olive
garden
outside
of
duluth
the
best
thing
i
can
say
is
that
this
was
the
most
beautiful
olive
garden
ive
ever
seen
it
sits
high
on
a
hill
with
hundreds
of
black
rocks
around
it
if
you
are
in
duluth
and
like
olive
garden
go
to
this
one
the
beer
pours
a
light
yellow
with
a
small
head
the
smell
is
faint
floral
hops
and
malts
the
taste
is
bland
what
happened
to
this
pale
lager
it
used
to
be
good
no
longer
do
i
taste
the
saaz
hops
or
noble
hops
its
just
dull
i
think
miller
sab
bought
this
and
ruined
it
not
recommended
olive
garden
although
is
highly
recommended
if
you
visit
duluth
check
this
one
out
d
the
light
bodied
characteristics
of
this
beer
make
it
very
drinkable
and
highly
sessionable
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
on
a
warm
summer
day
but
there
are
better
selections
out
there
a
clear
light
straw
color
with
two
fingers
of
fizzy
white
head
lively
carbonation
aroma
of
slightly
skunked
floral
hops
and
light
grain
flavor
is
malty
up
front
with
a
floral
hop
finish
and
aftertaste
very
little
else
thin
watery
mouthfeel
light
body
drinkable
but
not
very
good
as
mentioned
very
tasty
with
a
sturdy
amount
of
malt
lemon
zest
and
a
touch
of
grainy
spice
in
the
finish
i
really
enjoyed
this
brew
and
will
look
forward
to
the
next
couple
paired
really
well
with
the
linguini
in
red
wine
clam
sauce
nice
to
try
but
it
is
boring
and
i
would
even
prefer
a
mgd
to
this
stuff
okay
one
can
drink
a
bunch
of
these
but
i
cant
think
of
an
occasion
that
would
be
appropriate
overall
it
is
very
light
very
drinkable
pretty
much
what
you
would
expect
from
a
euro
lager
this
beer
pours
a
clear
extra
pale
straw
color
the
head
is
a
half
inch
in
height
and
recedes
quickly
into
minimal
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
bready
malt
with
a
moderate
spicy
noble
hop
presence
it
is
quite
nice
and
very
good
for
the
style
the
taste
is
a
lot
like
the
aroma
with
the
hops
being
slightly
more
dominant
again
very
nice
for
the
the
style
the
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
high
carbonation
but
not
too
high
overall
im
very
surprised
by
this
beer
it
isnt
only
good
for
its
style
it
is
good
all
around
i
would
certainly
drink
this
again
cheers
d
a
nice
lager
that
goes
down
smoothly
preferably
in
summer
this
beer
would
taste
rather
nice
with
a
pizza
overall
an
average
drinking
euro
lager
similar
to
a
heineken
with
a
bolder
hop
character
pours
a
light
yellow
pale
color
with
a
one
finger
head
the
smell
is
weak
and
is
not
very
complex
there
is
not
alot
going
on
in
the
smell
department
the
taste
once
again
is
not
very
complex
either
there
is
very
few
notes
of
anything
in
it
the
carbonationis
on
the
high
side
overall
you
could
drink
a
couple
of
the
beers
but
not
a
lot
there
is
not
much
going
on
with
this
beer
d
one
pint
was
enough
for
me
in
fact
34
of
one
is
plenty
come
to
think
of
it
glad
i
tried
it
on
tap
because
i
can
only
assume
that
the
bottled
version
is
like
watching
a
paula
poundstone
routine
i
kid
i
kid
no
actually
i
think
im
dead
on
d
you
can
definitely
detect
the
bavarian
influence
in
this
beer
for
that
reason
its
a
notch
above
most
euro
lagers
d
good
but
this
is
not
worth
a
second
look
for
me
poured
from
a
green
bottle
into
a
weizen
glass
has
a
pale
yellow
color
with
a
small
head
aroma
is
very
mild
almost
non
existent
there
is
a
light
crisp
taste
not
much
flavor
feels
ok
in
the
mouth
and
is
fairly
drinkable
overall
this
is
a
pretty
mediocore
beer
pours
with
a
very
small
white
head
that
soon
vanishes
no
lacing
body
is
extremely
clear
and
yellow
immediately
after
opened
a
very
skunky
aroma
is
present
which
dissipates
as
the
beer
sits
in
the
glass
for
a
few
minutes
otherwise
the
only
aroma
i
get
is
fading
skunkiness
oddly
enough
while
it
is
light
on
the
palate
its
body
is
still
slightly
fuller
than
i
would
have
expected
from
its
appearance
fizzy
carbonation
that
continues
while
drinking
tastes
ok
not
near
as
skunky
as
you
would
think
from
the
odor
but
the
flavor
is
gone
almost
immediately
lightly
bitter
dry
finish
and
i
do
mean
light
great
as
a
lawnmower
beer
but
if
you
want
to
really
taste
a
beer
id
definitely
recommend
something
else
not
a
bad
tasting
beer
its
just
nothing
special
overall
its
a
beer
that
is
not
pretending
much
you
can
have
a
couple
of
bottles
before
you
can
feel
its
presence
to
be
honest
i
really
like
this
beer
its
very
refreshing
and
i
find
few
beers
more
drinkable
than
this
the
sweetness
on
the
finish
is
what
makes
this
stick
out
the
most
for
me
d
not
my
beer
at
all
had
some
left
over
from
a
party
and
decided
why
not
try
it
great
on
a
hot
day
and
need
a
refreshing
drink
otherwise
an
italian
version
of
grolsch
or
heniken
average
on
the
drinkability
scale
worth
a
shot
if
you
see
it
around
one
of
my
favorites
amongst
the
golden
lager
group
looks
pretty
average
golden
clear
with
white
head
that
leaves
little
bit
of
lacing
smells
great
full
of
hops
tastes
good
too
a
little
bit
less
hoppy
than
it
smells
but
still
good
tends
to
leave
me
with
a
slightly
bitter
mouth
but
very
drinkable
otherwise
bonus
points
for
being
the
beer
of
my
motherland
cin
cin
no
character
or
individuality
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
but
lacks
class
drinkability
nothing
really
impressive
about
this
one
im
not
saying
avoid
it
but
its
not
something
to
run
out
to
the
stores
and
grab
it
up
one
was
enough
for
me
cuz
its
just
not
that
exciting
d
drinks
pretty
easily
not
the
greatest
tasting
lager
ive
had
but
its
not
bad
at
all
drinkability
very
easy
very
inoffensive
drinkability
a
decent
beer
not
crazy
about
the
flavor
there
are
better
italian
beers
out
there
most
noticeably
the
ones
from
birrificio
italiano
which
are
spectacular
color
is
very
pale
yellow
indicating
the
use
of
adjuncts
in
the
grain
bill
aroma
is
very
similar
to
a
draft
heineken
probably
due
to
a
similar
hop
variety
being
used
pours
with
a
nice
creamy
head
but
there
is
little
to
no
head
retention
overall
it
is
a
very
good
light
european
lager
with
nice
bitterness
and
a
pleasant
hop
aroma
d
to
me
this
means
would
i
want
another
since
im
impressed
well
not
a
beer
i
would
do
a
session
with
but
better
that
expected
overall
this
was
the
first
italian
beer
ive
had
and
was
not
sure
what
to
expect
this
beer
seems
pretty
basic
for
a
overseas
lager
light
mouthfeel
easy
drinking
and
not
a
ton
of
flavor
drinkability
for
the
style
this
is
very
sessionable
it
is
somewhat
more
tasty
than
others
in
this
category
i
have
had
this
before
and
never
thought
much
of
it
but
could
see
myself
drinking
a
six
after
cutting
the
grass
its
alright
easy
to
drink
and
has
a
bit
more
flavor
than
i
expected
theres
not
much
to
expect
from
this
style
otherwise
drinkability
was
average
had
a
somewhat
unpleasant
aftertaste
however
was
moderately
enjoyable
this
beer
just
doesnt
have
a
taste
it
may
have
some
when
its
really
fresh
before
the
skunk
taste
kicks
in
but
if
theres
a
taste
the
skunk
has
covered
it
completely
skunked
water
thats
about
it
dont
drink
and
review
d
goes
down
easily
but
shouldnt
be
considered
anywhere
near
memorable

i
like
the
crisp
clean
taste
and
feel
i
dig
this
for
a
euro
lager
sampled
from
a
bottle
on
feb
26
2009
at
an
olive
garden
restaurant
it
was
too
dark
to
see
an
expiration
date
or
lot
number
this
poured
a
pale
yellow
with
a
puffy
white
head
the
aroma
had
some
malt
and
hop
mixtures
but
overall
it
just
smelled
like
a
euromacro
lager
the
taste
was
more
malted
than
anything
else
i
must
say
that
despite
the
rather
average
overall
session
it
did
have
a
slightly
fresher
quality
about
it
that
helped
it
eke
out
a
slightly
better
grade
from
me
d
light
and
refreshing
not
setting
the
import
world
on
fire
on
par
with
its
contemporaries
had
this
on
tap
at
carinos
restaurant
pours
a
wonderfully
clean
and
clear
dark
yellow
little
head
which
disappeared
except
for
the
outter
ring
malts
dominate
the
nose
with
a
sweet
hint
almost
like
a
candy
sweetnesss
but
very
slight
crisp
and
refreshing
and
lite
distinct
malt
aftertaste
which
is
welcomed
overall
would
buy
again
out
but
would
skip
over
for
another
choice
while
at
an
italian
restaurant
for
valentines
day
i
decided
to
give
this
one
a
try
as
the
only
other
things
that
where
on
the
menu
seemed
to
bmc
products
poured
from
the
normal
green
bottle
had
a
straw
yellow
color
with
a
good
amount
of
bubbly
carbonation
the
white
head
was
relatively
small
and
did
not
last
long
the
aroma
of
the
brew
surprisingly
was
not
skunky
pale
malt
scent
is
really
all
that
i
am
picking
up
though
the
flavor
is
very
bland
but
sumwhat
refreshing
with
the
food
that
i
got
has
a
sweet
grainy
taste
and
that
is
about
it
very
clean
tasting
brew
just
did
not
have
character
but
for
me
it
it
seemed
to
be
better
than
the
last
coors
i
had
which
was
probably
last
summer
taste
follows
the
nose
and
is
relatively
flat
and
light
for
the
style
the
lack
of
sweetness
was
welcome
but
the
beer
otherwise
fell
on
its
face
as
for
flavor
or
lack
thereof
offers
average
feel
and
drinkability
high
carbonation
and
effervescence
helps
cover
the
lack
of
malt
structure
to
a
degree
thus
supporting
the
feel
drink
is
easy
low
in
abv
and
assumably
in
calories
as
well
though
i
didnt
see
any
point
in
reaching
for
a
second
tastewise
it
is
marginally
better
and
if
there
is
nothing
else
available
i
suppose
i
would
drink
a
few
of
these
still
after
drinking
one
of
these
in
italy
i
chose
to
stick
with
wine
for
the
remainder
of
the
trip
pours
a
yellowish
clear
colored
body
with
an
average
whitish
colored
head
bubbly
and
diminishing
has
a
malty
effervescent
big
beer
aroma
to
it
a
malty
taste
refreshing
a
little
tastier
than
heineken
clean
aftertaste
tasty
d
had
quite
a
few
of
these
over
the
summer
in
a
coastal
town
outside
of
milan
a
great
beer
for
a
hot
day
taste
the
taste
is
very
similar
to
the
smell
but
a
little
bit
sweeter
the
aftertaste
is
bitter
but
doesnt
linger
too
long
well
i
cant
say
im
overly
impressed
in
fact
i
thought
it
was
not
worth
finishing
the
bottle
the
light
yellow
color
was
average
for
a
pale
lager
the
taste
is
very
bitter
and
that
feeling
lingers
on
the
tongue
the
aroma
is
like
slightly
sour
malts
i
am
not
trying
this
one
again
d
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
this
is
an
easytodrink
beer
but
there
isnt
anything
special
about
it
it
has
a
faint
bitter
taste
to
it
very
similar
to
a
macro
lager
not
a
bad
beer
just
nothing
that
jumps
out
either
d
very
little
distinguishes
this
beer
from
a
hundred
others
its
drinkability
is
decently
good
but
it
is
not
a
memorable
beer
overall
this
seems
like
it
must
be
the
bud
of
italian
beers
i
have
one
every
once
in
a
while
and
i
could
see
having
a
few
although
there
are
better
italian
lagers
served
from
a
green
bottle
at
refrigeration
temperature
pale
straw
color
with
big
white
head
that
gave
off
skunky
aromas
as
soon
as
the
bottle
was
cracked
the
taste
was
sulfurymineraly
with
no
maltiness
and
a
harsh
acrid
bite
possibly
due
to
carbonation
with
the
skunkiness
always
lingering
in
the
background

a
subpar
skunk
of
a
eurolager
barely
a
step
above
heineken
probably
good
for
a
quick
refreshing
beer
after
mowing
the
lawn
had
on
tap
at
bravos
with
an
italian
dinner
this
was
not
a
good
beer
it
made
no
good
impressions
it
was
crystal
clear
yellow
color
film
of
white
bubbles
the
smell
was
neutral
nothing
at
all
maybe
malt
the
taste
was
nothing
special
either
just
bland
like
carbonated
water
with
a
little
malt
flavor
ill
choose
water
next
time
poured
into
a
frosted
tumbler
pale
yellow
very
pale
as
expected
foamy
white
head
builds
up
but
fades
even
faster
its
your
standard
green
bottle
macro
lager
this
seemed
to
have
little
to
no
skunkage
the
taste
had
light
sweetness
with
the
lagerish
finish
ive
had
better
pale
lagers
but
this
wasnt
horrible
pours
a
clear
straw
yellow
with
a
white
head
that
quickly
fades
pretty
disappointing
the
nose
carries
faint
hints
of
honey
and
a
distant
whisper
of
lemon
reminds
of
me
of
camomile
tea
for
all
intents
and
purposes
this
beer
is
tasteless
the
body
is
light
and
it
goes
down
with
an
easy
dryness
theres
something
lemony
and
thirst
quenching
about
it
but
i
intantly
regretted
buying
this
pack
and
will
never
buy
another
nothing
inspiring
to
be
found
d
i
think
this
is
very
drinkable
when
served
ice
cold
i
can
put
these
back
with
the
best
of
them
overall
i
was
impressed
i
enjoyed
this
brew
taste
heineken
nothing
special
about
this
beer
nothing
real
bad
about
it
either
euro
pale
lager
just
happens
to
be
a
rather
boring
style
the
flavor
does
tend
to
linger
a
bit
but
i
think
this
is
one
situation
where
you
dont
want
that
to
happen
the
finish
with
smooth
and
the
mouth
feel
was
astringent
overall
it
was
an
okay
beer
nothing
special
d
whats
less
than
zero
d
why
would
anyone
want
to
drink
this
glad
i
got
to
split
this
jewel
with
a
fellow
ba
thin
watery
d
easy
drinking
beer
the
skunky
smell
did
not
carry
over
to
the
taste
at
all
a
little
heavy
on
the
carbonation
for
me
but
your
average
beer
in
my
opinion
nothing
special
im
really
not
a
fan
of
this
beer
i
think
ill
avoid
it
next
time
overall
a
palate
cleanser
and
nothing
more
had
it
at
a
pizza
restaurant
and
this
is
the
only
way
to
try
it
not
special
not
worth
going
to
again
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
because
it
feels
so
light
but
not
very
flavorful
i
wouldnt
have
more
than
2
maybe
in
a
day
unless
it
was
really
hot
bottle
from
the
utah
state
store
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
medium
white
head
that
goes
down
to
nothing
quickly
the
aroma
is
sweet
malts
and
corn
the
taste
is
similar
lots
of
smooth
and
sweet
malt
and
corn
a
ton
of
metallic
flavors
too
way
too
much
i
really
think
this
would
be
much
different
fresh
in
italy
at
least
i
hope
so
not
horrible
but
not
too
good
really
not
too
much
to
say
about
this
beer
its
far
better
than
stella
but
nowhere
near
as
good
as
czechvar
light
yellow
light
on
flavor
a
little
fizzy
a
bit
of
the
bud
light
tang
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
feels
like
slightly
fizzy
water
i
gave
it
a
somewhat
higher
drinkability
rating
because
i
could
see
myself
drinking
it
for
an
evening
if
there
were
no
better
options
available
drank
this
with
pizza
at
a
little
italian
restaurant
there
was
nothing
special
about
this
beer
it
poured
a
light
yellow
and
the
foam
did
not
last
long
it
tasted
pretty
much
like
any
macro
but
had
a
little
bit
of
a
crisper
flavor
i
would
not
go
out
of
my
way
for
this
beer
there
was
nothing
special
about
it
but
it
was
fine
with
the
pizza
nothing
spectacular
it
will
remind
u
of
becks
or
somthing
like
that
the
only
reason
i
got
it
was
to
try
a
beer
from
italy
and
thats
al
they
have
going
for
it
italians
should
stick
to
wine
as
this
is
just
a
blandboring
euro
lager
its
crisp
and
refreshing
but
totally
lacking
on
tasteappearance
and
smell
i
would
have
this
again
if
given
to
me
but
i
wouldnt
buy
it
in
a
store
in
a
hundred
years
d
this
isnt
a
particularly
good
beer
its
not
offensively
bad
but
it
lacks
any
definitive
flavor
or
personality
pours
a
clear
bubbly
straw
color
with
a
bubbly
white
head
that
showed
very
good
retention
and
lacing
smell
is
very
nondescript
with
hints
of
pale
malts
and
mild
hops
the
taste
has
a
slightly
hoppier
kick
to
it
with
a
little
bitterness
in
the
finish
the
pale
grains
are
present
in
the
background
throughout
the
mouthfeel
is
very
crisp
and
dry
with
lots
of
carbonation
this
is
actually
a
decent
lager
on
a
sunny
summer
afternoon
overallnice
on
a
hot
day
in
florence
but
it
does
nothing
different
than
any
other
euro
pale
lager
and
thus
cant
be
recommended
not
terrible
in
italy
they
have
this
and
turbog
if
you
dont
want
the
house
wine
go
with
the
turbog
stranded
at
a
t
g
i
fridays
i
had
no
choice
but
to
go
italian
the
beer
poured
off
the
tap
a
straw
gold
with
great
clarity
and
lots
of
visible
carbonation
rising
in
it
one
finger
head
of
white
head
but
poor
retention
soon
became
a
thin
skim
and
weak
lacing
too
the
aroma
was
dry
slightly
floral
hops
the
taste
was
equally
disappointing
understated
pilsner
malt
dry
and
bitter
hop
finish
thats
it
light
to
medium
body
and
sessionable
but
why
would
you
want
to
do
that
to
yourself

3152008
sampled
this
a
few
times
recently
at
italian
restaurants
that
didnt
have
much
else
on
the
menu
very
pale
looking
golden
color
somewhat
carbonated
and
the
head
quickly
fizzles
down
to
absolutely
nothing
it
looked
like
a
glass
of
apple
juice
aroma
is
grainy
with
hints
of
hay
very
much
like
a
traditional
lager
it
tastes
a
little
grassy
with
sweet
hops
and
a
slightly
sour
finish
to
it
pretty
easy
drinking
but
boring
and
could
use
more
flavor
nice
crisp
beer
good
carbonation
probably
will
not
buy
a
sixer
to
take
home
but
i
would
order
it
out
for
dinner
at
an
italian
restaurant
if
not
drinking
vino
having
long
seen
and
avoided
this
i
tried
it
for
the
first
time
at
minnecis
a
splendid
local
italian
restaurant
to
my
surprise
this
wasnt
bad
though
the
initial
presentation
begged
for
patience
a
barely
visible
patch
of
white
foam
coated
a
dark
golden
body
nothing
special
and
worse
i
feared
a
flat
beer
sweet
malt
mixed
with
slightly
spicy
hopsdecent
nose
fairly
good
taste
to
my
pleasant
surprise
creamy
and
smooth
fairly
decent
malt
presence
not
flat
slight
peppery
hop
taste
not
bad
the
mouthfeel
reveals
certain
weaknesses
such
as
a
thin
body
a
need
for
a
more
balanced
hop
presence
however
this
was
a
pretty
decent
macro
one
i
may
order
again
ok
but
better
than
i
expected
average
drinker
this
wasnt
a
bad
change
of
pace
but
i
dont
think
its
something
i
would
buy
again
had
this
italian
macro
on
tap
at
the
upfront
co
in
marquette
mi
this
beer
pours
a
golden
straw
color
with
no
head
theres
not
much
going
on
here
this
beer
has
light
carbonation
not
much
i
can
say
about
the
taste
drinkability
is
moderate
certainly
better
than
an
american
macro
but
thats
not
saying
much
poured
a
pale
gold
body
with
a
onefinger
head
that
died
quickly
possessed
a
faint
aroma
of
grains
and
earthiness
a
lightbodied
brew
that
went
a
little
slick
but
had
some
hop
bite
as
well
as
a
grainy
huskiness
to
it
not
much
for
taste
but
at
least
it
went
down
smooth
just
a
halfdecent
euro
lager
that
isnt
worth
getting
again
ive
had
a
few
of
these
over
the
years
in
bottles
and
on
tap
its
a
decent
beer
for
hot
summer
days
when
you
need
to
quench
your
thirst
but
it
is
not
particularly
satisfying
its
just
a
little
darker
than
an
american
pilsner
style
not
impressive
and
it
sports
an
underwhelming
head
but
yesterday
i
had
a
pitcher
at
an
italian
restaurant
and
was
surprised
at
how
well
it
paired
with
the
garlicrich
pasta
with
white
sauce
and
chicken
this
dish
brought
out
the
beers
understated
but
smooth
maltiness
bottom
line
is
that
its
not
too
great
to
drink
by
itself
but
it
can
complement
the
right
italian
food
i
guess
thats
why
its
popular
in
italy
where
its
made
feels
and
drinks
pretty
good
but
there
are
lots
of
other
beers
of
this
style
id
choose
before
this
one
d
maybe
if
youre
outside
on
a
hot
summer
day
but
thats
about
it
drank
right
from
the
bottle
tastes
good
cold
but
as
it
got
warm
it
tasted
winey
and
lost
its
appeal
ive
had
this
beer
many
times
and
its
average
at
best
my
wife
is
italian
and
she
likes
it
big
surprise
it
reminds
me
of
a
canadian
lager
but
not
as
good
somewhat
like
sam
adams
lager
worth
a
shot
waitress
didnt
offer
a
glass
so
i
drank
it
right
from
the
bottle
looked
like
your
typical
macro
but
i
like
to
drink
italian
at
italian
restaurants

was
a
little
bit
skunky

was

was
what
youd
expect
from
this
type
of

was
surprisingly

a

of

i
would
much
rather
prefer
a
glass
of
this
over
any
american
macro
mouthfeel
was
medium
to
light
there
was
a
huskiness
in
the
texture
which
i
always
love
one
of
my
favorite
euro
lagers
drinkability
after
a
long
day
of
being
hot
and
sticky
this
was
a
very
nice
refreshing
beer
highly
sessionable
and
flavorful
for
its
style
drinkability
i
could
barely
finish
the
glass
just
a
flavorless
european
macro
you
should
avoid
you
could
drink
a
whole
lot
of
these
and
not
even
know
it
the
peroni
gals
showed
up
at
a
bar
i
was
at
doling
out
free
brew
as
they
went
on
their
buxom
way
so
i
got
one
it
wasnt
very
good
its
your
standard
macro
lager
quite
similar
to
your
heineken
actually
maybe
slightly
stronger
in
citrusy
hops
but
similar
in
the
skunky
nastiness
it
would
certainly
get
you
drunk
though
d
not
bad
but
unremarkable
this
stuff
is
okay
but
you
can
do
a
lot
better
for
nine
bucks
a
six
pack
served
at
a
good
cold
temperature
this
is
a
good
drinkable
beer
unfortunately
many
locations
do
not
serve
this
at
the
proper
temperature
as
it
has
been
served
to
my
wife
and
i
at
almost
room
temperature
good
lesson
in
proper
serving
temp
for
maximum
enjoyment
of
a
beer
not
too
warm
not
too
cold

ultimately
your
folks
for
the
italian
version
pours
a
pale
yellow
lager
with
some
malt
and
cheesy
aroma
a
lot
of
air
bubbles
head
that
recede
quickly
easy
drinking
kind
of
watery
mouthfeel
smooth
in
its
pale
yellow
lagery
way
d
college
session
beer
d
easy
to
drink
nothing
here
going
on
that
would
stop
you
from
drinking
these
all
day
but
just
not
a
real
good
flavour
here
i
spose
you
could
drink
several
of
these
if
you
wanted
to
its
not
undrinkable
but
why
theres
great
beers
out
there
lets
not
waste
time
on
this
one
d
goes
down
easily
enough
but
certainly
not
something
that
i
would
be
fond
of
ordering
again
to
me
this
beer
tasted
like
italys
version
of
an
american
macro
brew
i
wouldnt
recommend
this
one
but
its
drinkable
if
it
on
special
at
your
local
bar
or
restaurant
another
bland
lager
to
add
to
the
record
i
wasnt
expecting
much
and
i
wasnt
surprised
with
anything
it
tastes
a
lot
like
heinekin
though
lacks
the
pungent
skunk
aroma
its
inoffensive
enough
to
drink
a
few
or
with
a
meal
the
beer
pours
very
skunky
even
before
i
can
get
it
poured
i
can
smell
it
from
at
least
two
feet
awayit
is
gold
in
color
with
a
couple
fingers
of
snow
white
head
that
fades
away
quickly
leaving
no
lacing
behind
it
tastes
much
the
way
it
smells
with
some
grainy
malts
hid
well
behind
typical
euro
flavors
the
beer
is
pretty
light
but
has
decent
body
and
soft
affect
on
the
tounge
overall
a
decent
beernothing
offensivebutnothing
special
here
either
its
a
reasonably
drinkable
brew
nothing
remarkable
but
you
could
session
it
due
to
the
lack
of
strong
taste
and
light
alcohol
content
d
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
really
better
than
average
i
was
a
little
worried
when
i
smelled
it
as
it
had
some
euro
funk
to
it
but
the
taste
was
pretty
good
late
pale
strawcolored
average
white
head
with
little
retention
or
lacing
sweetish
taste
of
white
grape
and
rose
hips
is
rather
thin
and
watery
which
i
expected
but
grew
on
me
which
i
did
not
a
not
unpelasant
drink
on
an
unseasonably
warm
sunny
spring
afternoon
but
definitely
not
adding
much
dynamic
to
the
world
of
beer
d
pretty
good
i
could
stick
with
this
one
for
a
while
if
you
like
the
style
definitely
give
this
one
a
try
its
miles
above
heineken
in
my
opinion
feels
about
normal
fairly
smooth
its
an
easy
to
drink
lager
this
is
a
decent
lager
if
a
bit
overpriced
the
taste
was
okay
a
splash
of
hops
and
pale
malt
but
it
offers
very
little
in
terms
of
character
or
finish
for
an
italian
lager
i
prefer
birra
moretti
if
available
md
mouthfeel
was
interesting
as
it
seemed
to
be
more
than
it
is
when
it
first
hits
the
tongue
then
it
quickly
gets
water
again
this
may
be
biased
because
i
had
it
with
food
but
it
really
worked
for
me
at
the
dinner
table
would
i
purchase
it
for
personal
consumption
at
home
probably
not
drinkability
very
common
italian
beer
but
without
any
character
mf
d
refreshing
at
best
medium
high
carbonation
its
crisp
and
clean
and
im
sure
a
guy
stranded
in
one
of
italys
expansive
deserts
would
appreciate
it
as
a
life
saver
but
i
had
a
hard
time
finishing
this
glass
d
no
thanks
next
to
no
flavour
bloating
not
even
nice
to
look
at
pass
feels
thin
and
crisp
like
i
reckon
it
should
might
cut
through
the
alfredomushroom
sauce
like
it
was
created
for
the
task
doubt
if
i
ever
get
one
of
these
outside
of
an
italian
restaurant
but
will
have
a
couple
when
i
do
light
to
medium
yellowish
with
a
good
white
head
that
lasted
a
bit
smell
is
honey
malt
and
touch
of
bitter
hop
very
nice
refreshing
bitterness
followed
by
a
nice
smooth
finish
nice
clean
and
easy
to
drink
good
enjoyable
beer
but
could
have
been
a
touch
more
carbonated
still
was
similar
to
a
nice
crisp
pilsner
smell
is
somewhat
skunky
even
after
allowing
to
breath
a
little
yeasty
too
taste
is
ok
but
nothing
spectacular
maybe
the
italian
alternative
to
a
big
3
domestic
beer
finish
is
ok
with
a
little
aftertaste
o
i
enjoyed
the
beer
but
the
way
the
waiter
made
it
soundi
thought
it
would
be
something
spectacular
i
have
got
to
stop
asking
waitresses
at
moderate
priced
restaurants
to
pick
the
beer
for
my
meal
thats
how
i
tried
kingfisher
the
advantage
of
this
beer
is
that
its
crisp
and
refreshing
cold
unfortunately
it
is
lacking
in
the
area
of
taste
and
body
which
hurts
it
a
bit
its
very
drinkable
and
sure
to
be
enjoyed
by
those
who
like
macro
lagers
its
just
a
bit
too
light
for
me
pale
colored
beer
with
skunky
aromai
thought
green
bottles
were
supposed
to
keep
the
light
out
taste
is
kind
of
a
watery
hop
taste
with
a
slight
skunk
aftertaste
this
is
not
a
beer
that
i
will
be
trying
again
anytime
soon
actually
a
little
disappointed
drinkability
is
good
the
ultra
light
brews
usually
attract
a
wide
range
of
drinkers
this
bas
palate
not
included
when
having
dinner
in
an
italian
restaurant
peroni
seemed
liked
the
most
promising
choice
as
poured
by
the
waitress
into
a
tall
glass
there
was
a
large
frothy
head
atop
a
clear
golden
colored
liquid
threes
not
much
noteworthy
about
peroni
its
taste
is
crisp
and
clean
but
devoid
of
much
flavor
other
than
a
hint
of
hops
you
could
have
another
with
the
meal
or
some
sparkling
mineral
water
not
much

is
the
compliment
the

ascribed
to
this

and
the
attribute
sticks
as
for
the
taste
this
is
beer
best

with

ill
drink
this
again
12oz
green
bottle
as
part
of
a
european
beer
sampler
very
clear
very
light
yellow
with
virtually
no
head
slight
grainy
malt
in
the
aroma
but
not
much
else
tastes
slightly
sweet
with
slight
hints
of
hops
and
dms
but
otherwise
rather
clean
watery
mouthfeel
with
less
carbonation
than
expected
but
enough
an
easy
drinker
for
sure
not
really
offensive
in
any
way
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
either
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
if
offered
it
but
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
either
this
is
a
decent
light
beer
and
pairs
well
with
some
great
italian
food
tastes
like
a
mix
between
bud
and
heineken
the
body
is
really
light
and
has
almost
no
backbone
its
definitely
got
a
smooth
feel
to
it
but
the
hops
are
barely
there
theres
nothing
special
about
peroni
the
extra
cost
for
this
is
going
to
shipping
costs
not
flavor
boy
ohfortwo
with
the
beer
from
italy
try
the
wine
would
be
my
advice
so
far
this
was
part
of
a
european
sampler
pack
mrs
kdog
picked
up
otherwise
it
wouldnt
have
been
on
my
list
i
dont
think
id
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
another
maybe
with
my
meal
at
an
italian
restaurant
in
the
summer
no
surprises
in
the
taste
department
maybe
a
little
weaker
and
thin
compared
to
other
macro
lagers
from
europe
the
lack
of
carbonation
doesnt
help
with
this
beer
and
it
is
very
light
i
guess
it
would
be
a
nice
change
from
a
bud
on
a
hot
day
standard
white
head
over
a
very
pale
golden
lager
body
a
lighter
medium
carbonation
on
the
high
side
of
the
medium
range
pretty
standard
aromas
and
flavors
pale
malts
and
a
grassy
noble
hop
type
presence
slightly
sulfuric
with
a
nice
dose
of
hop
spice
somewhat
watery
on
the
nose
and
to
a
lesser
extent
on
the
tongue
d
a
little
tasty
goes
down
easily
enough
not
filling
at
all
this
is
yet
another
euro
pale
lager
that
just
doesnt
do
anything
for
me
if
im
going
to
drink
a
beer
that
tastes
like
a
macro
then
i
might
as
well
just
drink
a
macro
and
not
pay
the
imported
price
for
it
unique
and
worth
the
try
but
in
the
grand
world
of
beer
even
lagers
this
is
a
thud
maybe
some
brewery
fresh
samplings
would
wash
down
some
garlic
laden
pepperoni
pizza
quite
well
but
i
doubt
ill
ever
have
that
chance
ok
being
italian
i
may
be
a
little
bias
to
this
beer
also
as
an
italian
i
am
completely
aware
that
beer
is
not
really
the
most
hailed
of
beverages
at
the
boot
with
that
being
said
i
must
say
that
this
isnt
really
a
bad
beer
it
looks
and
smells
like
any
other
lager
out
there
but
it
tastes
a
bit
like
champagne
yes
i
said
champagne
nice
beer
and
goes
well
with
just
about
any
meal
the
only
con
is
the
price
six
usually
go
for
about
89
for
that
price
you
mind
as
well
get
something
you
will
enjoy
a
bit
more
however
a
great
alternative
to
wine
when
dining
at
just
about
any
fine
italian
eatery
or
pizzeria
in
the
tristate
area
d
drinkable
beer
for
the
fact
it
is
light
on
the
stomach
not
bad
for
an
occasional
sipper
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
but
taste
gets
old
after
a
while
one
dimensional
and
gets
badly
sweeter
as
it
warms
up
a
little
poured
into
a
pint
glass
peroni
has
a
very
light
yellow
color
and
tall
head
that
immediately
fades
the
aroma
has
a
slight
creamy
malt
smell
but
not
much
else
the
flavor
is
low
but
as
it
warms
a
bit
theres
a
pleasant
apple
flavor
to
be
had
with
the
slight
lager
tang
i
guess
once
this
warms
a
bit
its
not
too
bad
probably
one
of
the
better
light
euro
lagers
ive
had
poured
out
of
a
green
bottlelight
piss
yellow
with
a
2
finger
white
foamy
head
that
lingers
around
and
very
mild
lacing
smell
the
skunk
upon
first
whiff
than
grainsmusty
corn
and
haytaste
is
about
the
same
with
some
bitterness
and
sweetness
at
the
very
end
finishing
off
dry
mouth
is
watery
thin
and
little
carbonation
this
is
nothing
great
and
overpricedfor
this
price
i
can
find
some
decent
canadian
macro
and
enjoy
a
lot
more
drinkability
i
started
to
review
this
as
a
pale
euro
lager
but
then
i
noticed
it
is
in
the
style
of
american
macro
whatever
it
does
not
really
matter
much
as
this
beer
is
below
average
and
way
over
priced
i
put
one
bottle
in
a
mixed
six
pack
to
try
i
would
not
pay
the
910
for
a
six
pack
for
this
peroni
nastro
azzuro
is
the
peroni
that
we
drink
here
in
america
there
is
about
three
different
peronis
to
choose
from
on
this
site
that
i
think
are
all
the
same
so
i
went
with
this
one
peroni
pours
nicely
with
very
little
aroma
i
am
not
a
pale
euro
guy
but
this
beer
has
less
of
a
skunk
taste
than
others
which
i
like
it
has
a
good
mouthfeel
and
very
drinkable
i
guess
its
a
good
reason
they
just
started
shipping
in
12
packs
drinkability
a
little
too
generic
and
reminding
me
of
college
days
this
is
a
straightforward
and
not
overly
complicated
beer
on
a
hot
day
in
italy
you
cant
go
wrong
drinking
this
then
again
on
a
hot
day
in
italy
your
hard
pressed
to
find
anything
else
in
the
land
where
wine
is
king
this
beer
has
a
certain
quaffable
quality
like
a
certain
other
green
bottle
despite
shortcomings
i
had
to
laugh
at
doublejs
observation
that
this
was
great
to
wash
down
a
mess
of
stuffed
pasta
and
sausage
but
thats
a
good
way
to
sum
it
up
d
i
have
this
beer
when
i
eat
at
italian
places
and
i
dont
wanna
do
vino
which
seems
more
and
more
these
days
i
just
have
to
say
beer
is
better
not
a
bad
beer
refreshing
and
there
is
a
bit
of
flavor
there
i
guess
its
your
typical
pale
euro
lager
nothing
special
pretty
drinkable
a
beer
that
i
thought
i
may
have
been
too
harsh
on
with
my
first
review
second
sampling
proves
this
is
correct
i
would
rate
peroni
in
the
same
league
as
heineken
not
a
good
beer
but
not
a
particularly
bad
one
either
not
the
best
euro
pale
lageri
have
taste
but
still
very
goodmaybe
i
would
have
some
with
some
italian
entree
bright
light
gold
with
a
thin
and
lightly
soapy
clean
white
head
the
smell
reaches
the
nose
quickly
with
clean
dry
grassy
grains
this
is
repeated
in
the
taste
but
with
a
lighter
version
the
lightness
of
the
mouthfeel
gives
a
wet
finish
with
light
carbonation
this
beer
is
not
the
greatest
standalone
but
it
would
make
a
great
light
compliment
to
heavy
meals
as
it
is
refreshing
and
very
easydrinking
smell
of
skunk
with
little
head
that
didnt
last
this
was
my
first
and
probably
my
last
italian
beer
if
this
is
the
number
1
beer
in
italy
i
understand
their
affinity
for
wine
poured
a
very
uninspiring
light
yellow
color
reminiscent
of
urine
underhopped
weak
finish
heinous
some
carbonation
bubbles
streaming
to
the
top
i
smell
faint
earthly
hops
i
taste
carmel
and
some
faint
hop
flavor
the
taste
is
very
bland
and
pretty
bad
tasting
carbonation
is
pretty
easy
on
the
palate
i
wouldnt
buy
this
stuff
pretty
bad
i
wont
have
it
again
its
sort
of
weak
on
taste
and
smell
sort
of
something
to
drink
just
to
say
youve
done
it
drinkability
a
little
rough
around
the
edges
for
my
taste
fairly
strong
carbonation
fine
bubbles
massage
the
tongue
but
the
body
of
the
beer
is
just
too
light
and
comes
off
waterlike
just
kind
of
bad
the
beer
only
hints
at
remote
quality
from
the
depths
of
its
light
raped
isohumulone
compounds
dont
even
bother
this
stuffs
a
joke
a
refreshing
joke
but
a
joke
a
pretty
uninspred
beer
overall
but
makes
for
a
decent
lawnmower
option
definitely
not
worth
the
price
from
my
notes
6182007
over
the
atlantic
ocean
at
36000
on
alitalia
airline
part
of
the
meal
includes
beerwine
so
i
had
to
try
a
330ml
can
of
nastro
azzurro
it
is
no
different
than
on
tap
or
in
a
bottle
it
is
still
the
budweiser
of
italy
plus
since
you
only
have
a
plastic
cup
theres
not
much
nose
and
flavor
is
hoppy
with
plastic
in
the
background
and
a
lingering
bitter
aftertaste
best
by
aug
2008
i
tried
this
at
smokeless
joes
in
toronto
on
june
25
2007
this
was
poured
by
the
waitress
into
a
unibroue
glass
it
poured
very
clear
with
little
head
when
held
up
against
the
light
it
was
a
very
pale
yellow
the
aroma
was
weak
with
some
floral
hints
it
was
very
harsh
on
the
tongue
with
a
fair
bit
of
carbonation
the
taste
was
very
bitter
which
surprised
me
from
a
pale
lager
not
a
beer
i
will
try
again
anytime
soon
pours
an
uninspiring
clear
yellow
and
there
is
not
much
head
aroma
is
weak
and
malty
flavor
is
malty
and
has
some
bitterness
but
there
is
no
depth
it
tastes
no
different
from
a
hundred
other
lagers
that
i
have
tried
at
least
it
is
not
watery
like
some
american
macrobrews
very
pale
clear
bright
gold
with
a
head
that
fades
within
20
seconds
of
pouring
it
looks
like
apple
juice
now
with
no
hint
of
foam
on
top
nose
is
extremely
faint
a
whiff
of
sweet
grain
and
nothing
else
ultrabland
flavor
with
light
malt
being
the
only
discernable
flavor
no
detectable
hops
and
low
bitterness
very
clean
though
with
a
finish
that
fades
instantly
to
nothingness
if
you
drink
this
ice
cold
this
could
be
passable
just
dont
let
it
get
any
warmer
i
thought
this
was
a
little
not
much
better
when
i
had
it
in
italy
why
do
a
cultures
lager
beer
match
so
well
with
its
food
the
beer
itself
was
nothing
great
but
it
helped
clean
up
the
mess
of
stuffed
pasta
and
sausage
yes
another
lager
but
this
one
has
some
flavor
to
it
didnt
have
the
skunk
taste
a
heiny
has
tasted
like
a
corn
adjuct
to
me
not
much
hops
as
expected
easy
to
drink
i
will
be
in
italy
in
a
couple
of
weeks
and
i
suppose
i
will
be
drinking
this
stuff
quite
a
bit
not
sure
what
i
can
find
better
when
in
rome
or
when
in
an
italian
restaurant
whether
real
or
imagined
this
beer
seemed
to
go
really
well
with
my
pizza
and
pasta
light
yellow
color
soft
head
tiny
bubbles
looked
like
champagne
in
the
glass
subtle
euro
skunk
in
the
nose
but
the
light
smooth
mouthfeel
and
crisp
in
a
fruity
way
hops
taste
really
balanced
it
out
little
malt
to
speak
of
but
enough
for
a
satisfying
drink
with
dinner
unlike
some
other
macro
euros
with
their
metallic
aftertastes
or
in
your
face
hop
bite
this
one
ended
clean
and
slightly
bitter
surprisingly
refreshing
nothing
id
buy
to
keep
on
hand
but
definitely
something
id
do
again
when
dining
out
italian
buona
birra
overall
nastro
azzurro
is
a
beer
that
is
worth
a
try
it
could
be
a
good
fit
for
someones
personal
taste
better
than
a
bud
but
nothing
special
the
first
thing
i
noticed
was
that
skunky
smell
right
away
but
that
dimmer
over
time
and
the
beer
mellowed
out
the
taste
was
actually
not
horrible
but
it
was
very
bland
nothing
extra
ordinary
i
would
probably
have
again
if
i
was
thirsy
on
a
hot
day
but
nothing
that
is
really
going
to
make
any
hardcore
beer
lovers
go
wow
i
had
this
brew
on
tap
at
a
cafe
during
a
late
afternoon
walk
around
milan
its
a
light
yellow
colored
liquid
with
a
very
slim
head
the
aroma
is
faint
with
a
slight
whiff
of
hops
and
a
bit
of
grass
not
much
else
to
speak
of
in
the
smell
the
taste
is
similar
a
hint
of
grain
and
a
touch
of
hops
theres
also
a
slight
sweetness
the
consistency
of
the
brew
is
watery
with
modest
carbonation
frankly
it
reminds
me
of
an
american
lawnmower
beer
it
served
to
quench
my
thirst
but
didnt
excite
the
beer
lover
inside
peroni
nastro
azzurro
was
a
very
pale
yellow
color
with
good
clarity
it
had
a
nice
white
head
that
stuck
around
a
little
while
leaving
a
little
lace
behind
the
aroma
was
noble
hops
and
little
grain
the
taste
was
not
very
pleasing
a
little
sweet
grain
upfront
then
it
turns
a
little
harsh
with
a
dry
finish
it
was
mediumlight
in
body
with
medium
carbontion
drinkability
was
below
average
due
to
the
flavor
this
is
not
a
beer
that
i
will
be
trying
again
pours
a
very
light
golden
color
two
finger
head
that
quickly
came
down
to
a
slight
lace
around
the
edge
unfortunately
this
beer
was
served
to
me
a
little
warmer
than
i
would
usually
prefer
smell
was
quite
weak
just
a
slight
linger
of
floral
hops
coming
off
the
glass
not
really
happy
with
the
taste
it
just
came
off
as
bland
a
little
breadlike
left
a
dry
stale
taste
in
my
mouth
overall
i
found
the
beer
fairly
boring
for
less
money
there
are
plenty
of
other
uninspiring
beers
like
this
one
id
drink
this
over
a
few
beers
i
can
think
of
but
ill
get
a
six
pack
for
7
and
not
pay
4
for
it
ontap
overall
characterless
and
very
common
i
kind
of
doubt
that
i
will
have
another
one
d
a
little
more
bitterness
would
give
it
a
crisp
refreshing
quality
d
not
so
good
the
flavors
were
pretty
weak
d
not
bad
would
have
been
better
on
a
hot
day
not
one
i
would
run
out
and
get
again
but
might
have
it
if
i
were
out
for
italian
drinkability
its
best
suited
for
washing
down
food
although
thats
a
very
generous
assessment
if
you
see
peroni
lager
at
a
restaurant
give
it
a
try
if
its
nastro
azzurro
order
wine
or
water
this
was
779
a
sixpack
on
sale
at
safeway
here
in
eureka
ca
this
poured
a
very
pale
yellow
with
a
moderate
size
white
head
medium
lacing
was
left
in
the
glass
there
was
an
aroma
of
stale
yeast
in
the
nose
and
a
mouthfeel
that
was
actually
sharp
on
the
tongue
flavor
was
metallic
at
first
and
improved
some
as
the
beer
warmed
finish
was
distinctly
bitter
but
not
a
nice
bitter
i
did
not
particularly
care
for
this
brew
drinkability
i
split
this
beer
and
i
only
drank
34
of
it
didnt
enjoy
it
its
a
macro
with
an
imported
pricetag
if
this
is
your
kind
of
beer
well
there
are
plenty
of
american
brews
just
like
it
and
for
a
lot
less
money
this
is
easy
to
drink
just
because
water
is
easy
to
drink
this
is
a
typical
and
decent
european
pale
lager
in
general
its
something
that
i
wouldnt
bother
with
but
if
its
cheap
its
alright
nothing
too
interesting
about
it
but
nothing
objectionable
either
smells
like
hops
veggies
and
old
rope
not
offensive
but
odd
spritzy
mouthfeel
from
lively
carbonation
very
light
bodied
beer
tastes
awful
like
it
was
brewed
in
a
plastic
barrel
nasty
chemical
and
soap
flavours
feh
the
flavor
offers
a
clean
lightly
sweet
and
grainy
malt
thats
well
threadedthrough
with
spicy
and
very
lightly
herbal
hops
its
very
nicely
balanced
with
both
the
malt
and
hops
appearing
on
their
own
at
start
and
finish
respectively
but
also
as
one
perfectly
intertwined
combination
across
the
middle
a
bold
bitterness
runs
through
it
and
it
finishes
dry
with
lingering
spicy
hops
throughout
the
mouth
very
nice
had
this
brew
in
a
italian
restaurant
in
orlando
florida
i
must
begin
by
saying
the
italians
should
stick
to
making
wine
poured
a
light
yellow
hue
with
a
white
fizzy
head
that
disappeared
quickly
the
only
scent
i
got
was
of
old
wet
grass
and
the
flavor
was
non
existences
needless
to
say
i
drank
the
whole
brew
with
great
angst
rule1
drink
what
you
open
overall
this
brew
suck
for
my
palate
not
to
say
some
my
find
it
refleshing
i
ordered
this
at
an
italian
pizza
joint
the
bottle
doesnt
look
the
same
as
the
picture
above
its
now
a
blueish
label
with
red
letters
i
poured
it
into
a
mug
and
at
first
it
appears
to
be
highly
carbonated
lots
of
bubbles
and
gave
up
a
big
head
it
fades
rather
quickly
liquid
is
yellow
in
color
w
a
small
white
head
i
can
smell
a
grassy
scent
in
there
but
nothing
stands
out
the
taste
is
much
better
than
i
expected
its
got
a
slight
hoppy
taste
to
it
that
goes
down
very
smooth
its
a
bit
on
the
thin
side
but
the
gentle
bubbles
are
enjoyable
this
would
make
for
a
good
brew
to
have
on
the
boat
or
while
you
mow
your
lawn
i
was
sitting
outside
in
the
sun
it
was
rather
hot
out
w
the
sun
shining
on
me
and
i
can
say
this
beer
hit
the
spot
this
beer
was
better
in
the
bottle
than
in
the
mug
though
poured
the
palest
yellow
i
have
ever
seen
almost
clear
with
huge
seltzer
like
fizzy
head
smell
was
your
classic
light
malt
macro
smell
nothing
great
at
all
taste
was
about
the
same
really
wasnt
any
almost
thought
i
was
drinking
sprite
i
would
not
have
this
again
pours
light
beige
some
carbonation
no
head
looks
like
a
light
beer
smell
is
lightly
hopped
and
well
skunked
taste
follows
with
some
hops
not
much
flavor
and
a
bit
o
skunk
eh
tastes
and
smells
like
a
light
heineken
mouthfeel
is
very
light
also
a
decent
session
beer
i
suppose
but
im
not
impressed
i
ordered
this
at
the
macaroni
grill
restaurant
they
didnt
have
anything
worth
getting
on
tap
unfortunately
i
can
add
now
say
they
just
dont
have
any
beers
worth
getting
clear
yellow
appearance

medium
white
head
last
kind
of
long
nose
of
skunk
rice
grass
hint
of
hopps
and
hay

taste
of
straw
corn
and
light
hopps

semi

sparkly
body
however
dry
body

aftertaste
slightly
sweet
skunky
and
bitter
that
lingers
too
long
it
was
worth
trying
not
disappointed
but
once
was
enough
probably
wont
search
out
again
pours
a
quarter
inch
head
which
fades
right
to
nothing
no
lacing
at
all
color
is
clear
light
yellow
no
carbonation
very
flat
looking
in
appearance
smell
is
fresh
but
not
much
else
going
on
there
taste
has
slight
hop
watered
down
and
very
little
carbonation
mouthfeel
light
not
much
else
not
impressed
with
this
beer
for
an
import
and
would
not
pay
the
higher
price
for
it
when
there
are
better
here
that
i
can
buy
italians
get
puzzled
with
this
when
they
go
abroad
it
wa
snice
to
have
it
since
it
was
too
hot
in
italy
that
day
at
leats
the
day
i
had
it
but
a
little
expensive
on
my
oppinion
the
colour
is
just
as
a
regular
lager
golden
with
green
spots
normal
foam
but
good
nice
aroma
but
a
little
grasping
poured
a
clear
light
yellow
with
a
small
white
head
the
aroma
is
light
and
of
pale
malt
and
a
touch
of
hop
the
taste
is
very
clean
but
a
little
thin
for
my
taste
its
very
easy
drinking
just
not
very
flavorful
or
different
some
mild
grains
and
malt
flavor
tinge
of
soapy
hop
and
very
clean
finish
definatly
a
drinkable
beer
just
not
very
unique
or
flavorful
i
would
drink
this
one
again
and
again
and
again
get
my
buzz
on
n
might
go
well
with
food
but
on
its
own
id
rather
look
elsewhere
some
great
things
come
out
of
italy
this
unfortunately
isnt
one
of
them
mouthfeel
is
grainy
grassy
and
like
bad
medicine
that
i
really
dont
want
to
swallow
with
an
unbalanced
bitterness
that
leads
to
a
metallic
funk
that
is
just
plain
unapealling
pours
to
a
pale
yellow
color
with
thin
white
heaed
that
dissipates
quickly
and
leaves
little
lacing
the
aroma
is
mostly
floral
and
the
flavor
is
predominantlyt
floral
hops
the
palate
is
average
and
smooth
this
is
an
okay
beer
and
might
be
even
better
if
i
were
having
it
with
an
italian
meal
instead
of
just
tastetesting
by
itself
a
very
pale
light
lager
poured
into
the
frosted
glass
that
was
given
to
me
by
the
waiter
without
my
asking
smell
was
little
beyond
lager
yeast
smell
taste
was
an
odd
bitterness
not
a
good
hop
one
but
an
odd
green
apple
flavornot
desireable
mouthfeel
was
very
light
and
drinkablity
was
not
very
good
i
wont
get
this
beer
again
even
if
at
an
italian
restaurant
d
the
lack
of
taste
makes
it
very
drinkable
as
nothing
will
happen
to
you
this
is
why
italy
will
always
be
a
wine
country
had
one
of
these
ice
cold
and
it
still
smelled
skunky
i
wont
hold
it
against
it
though
i
know
it
was
sitting
in
a
lighted
area
for
a
loooong
time
appearance
is
high
life
in
color
a
little
less
putrid
looking
head
retention
is
alright
nothing
special
the
smell
skunky
and
malt
domination
little
hops
the
taste
is
that
of
a
cleaner
heineken
but
no
where
never
the
flavor
content
of
the
stubby
dutch
beer
not
saying
much
lots
of
carbonation
leaves
the
mouthfeel
light
and
sodalike
this
is
drinkable
just
like
any
other
average
examples
of
a
lager
but
i
would
never
buy
it
for
its
price
i
really
hope
there
is
a
better
italian
beer
out
there
because
for
thier
level
of
perfection
this
is
average
as
it
gets
this
beer
poured
a
clear
straw
color
with
a
thick
persistent
head
the
smell
was
hoppy
and
skunky
it
tasted
a
little
watery
with
perhaps
a
slight
hint
of
spice
and
a
bitter
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
with
pronounced
carbonation
this
would
be
a
drinkable
beer
served
cold
on
a
hot
day
d
an
easy
to
drink
thirstquencher
this
beer
pours
a
light
golden
color
with
a
bubbly
head
that
disappears
almost
instantly
there
is
a
strong
skunk
smell
at
first
that
slowly
disappears
the
taste
is
bland
at
best
and
is
as
unimpressive
as
the
look
the
feel
in
your
mouth
is
crisp
and
light
over
all
its
an
easy
drinking
beer
but
its
nothing
special
mweeeh
it
was
okay
pretty
good
frothy
head
on
it
and
a
pretty
dark
color
for
a
macro
lager
with
a
strong
skunk
aroma
only
has
a
slight
skunked
taste
though
i
dont
have
a
whole
lot
to
say
about
it
it
pretty
much
tasted
like
a
heineken
to
me
i
didnt
think
it
was
very
enjoyable
i
rate
my
macro
lagers
mostly
for
drinkability
that
is
the
less
offensive
it
is
and
the
better
i
can
just
drink
it
with
out
having
to
taste
it
the
better
this
one
was
just
skunky
enough
that
i
didnt
find
it
very
enjoyable
hoorah
for
green
bottles
overall
a
typical
eurolager
though
classified
as
an
american
macro
nastro
azzurro
means
blue
ribbon
in
italian
its
hard
for
me
to
believe
that
this
beer
ever
won
a
blue
ribbon
in
any
competition
anytime
anywhere
stick
with
americas
own
pabst
blue
ribbon
a
beer
that
kicks
this
beers
ass
to
the
moon
and
back
why
would
an
italian
brewery
make
an
american
macro
lager
better
yet
why
are
american
breweries
still
making
american
macro
lagers
anyhow
the
beer
smells
like
a
wet
dog
but
improves
as
the
beer
settles
in
the
glass
looks
more
german
lagerish
than
american
macro
which
encourages
me
flavors
are
pretty
clean
with
a
light
citrus
apple
flavor
and
spiced
nicely
with
citrus
grassy
hops
a
bit
fizzy
in
the
mouth
but
ultimately
nicely
weighted
and
moderatly
rounded
finishs
very
crisp
clean
and
with
a
lemony
minty
finish
a
good
one
for
the
patio
this
is
a
nice
pilsner
it
has
a
reasonable
body
and
contains
some
warmth
but
in
comparison
to
czech
pilsners
its
not
bitter
enough
very
light
and
very
refreshing
very
drinkable
beer
especially
on
a
hot
italian
afternoon
thumbs
up
for
this
one
d
kinda
sucky
one
dimensional
bitterness
without
much
flavour
is
a
big
turnoff
d
it
is
very
cut
and
dry
a
splash
of
dry
malt
then
some
bitterness
that
taste
like
hops
and
that
is
it
overall
quite
clean
overall
except
for
the
slight
amount
of
sulfur
in
the
aftertaste
balance
is
good
overall
making
it
drinkable
if
not
memorable
clear
gold
appearance
smell
like
it
tastes
bitter
the
bottle
in
hand
says
little
about
what
this
beer
is
made
from
but
a
lager
fan
will
know
its
water
hops
yeast
and
barley
that
are
your
typical
ingredients
the
appearance
is
of
yellow
water
with
a
light
white
head
that
dissolves
quickly
the
beer
has
a
faint
bitter
aroma
with
a
taste
that
is
slightly
bitter
overall
mouth
feel
is
light
and
watery
the
beer
is
would
be
a
contender
for
summer
drinking
and
might
go
nice
with
spicy
foods
where
you
want
a
beer
that
doesnt
present
an
over
powering
flavor
this
would
be
a
potential
session
beer
if
in
italy
best
before
end

im
trying
to
think
of
something
to
improve
it
but
all
i
can
come
up
with
is
to
start
from
scratch
there
are
better
italian
beers
out
there
overall
a
drinkable
beer
if
ever
in
an
italian
restaurant
peroni
nastro
azzuro
pours
an
extremely
pale
straw
like
color
from
a
twelve
ounce
green
bottle
into
a
pilsner
glass
aroma
is
hoppy
and
grassy
the
hop
aroma
could
be
confused
with
skunk
but
i
dont
believe
it
is
skunked
this
may
be
part
of
the
flavor
profile
taste
is
predominated
by
hops
definitely
a
grassy
or
grainy
flavor
as
well
not
terrible
for
a
euro
lager
probably
not
my
drink
of
choice
but
stands
up
well
to
other
euro
lagers
i
wouldnt
turn
one
down
if
offered
the
lightness
and
slight
noticeable
bitterness
makes
it
one
of
the
better
macro
lagers
at
least
its
got
something
to
hold
your
interest
tried
this
drink
at
a
local
italian
restaurant
the
owner
suggested
it
it
was
not
too
bad
of
a
lager
actually
i
liked
it
poured
a
nice
1
inch
head
that
stuck
around
for
3
minutes
or
so
then
stayed
at
a
nice
thin
layered
foam
the
smell
was
sweet
with
a
bit
of
hop
felt
decent
on
my
tongue
and
mouth
not
too
carbonated
not
too
little
real
nice
sweet
tasting
lager
again
not
too
sweet
a
very
nicely
balanced
beer
i
will
definately
try
again
i
really
liked
this
beer
because
it
had
that
trademark
lager
flavor
but
also
has
some
great
individual
characteristics
pleasantly
sweet
overall
i
dont
hate
it
but
not
one
i
would
buy
at
a
italian
restaurant
especially
for
the
import
price
overall
i
like
it
better
than
i
was
predicting
which
wasnt
very
much
while
still
not
a
style
i
prefer
this
was
fine
somewhat
refreshing
pours
a
medium
straw
with
a
small
white
foamy
head
that
quickly
diminishes
to
a
ring
theres
some
wicked
skunk
when
i
open
the
bottle
but
after
pouring
it
rinsing
the
bottle
putting
it
in
the
recycling
bin
and
getting
my
notepad
it
faded
away
what
it
uncovered
was
nothing
much
better
thin
grainy
aroma
with
a
light
floral
hops
presence
and
some
light
dough
the
taste
is
well
for
what
it
is
i
guess
its
not
terrible
but
its
nothing
good
either
weak
and
uninteresting
but
crisp
with
a
pleasantly
dry
finish
drank
the
rest
of
it
with
pizza
and
it
did
ok
but
id
never
buy
this
again
poured
a
pale
golden
color
with
modest
white
head
smell
is
mild
with
a
slight
grain
swwetness
noted
taste
is
very
crisp
and
dry
with
a
strong
refreshing
character
to
it
finish
is
more
crispness
with
a
nice
dryness
easy
drinking
would
have
enjoyed
more
with
some
italian
food
you
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
because
its
so
watery
but
why
bother
maybe
itd
be
good
with
some
pizza
sitting
at
a
cafe
in
italy
all
afternoon
but
its
not
for
those
who
like
beer
for
being
beer
a
pretty
uninspiring
beer
a
pale
yellow
body
with
a
fluffy
white
head
that
settles
down
in
no
time
flat
slightly
corny
smelling
with
a
hint
of
flowery
hops
the
taste
isnt
bad
but
its
nothing
to
write
home
about
either
a
little
corn
sweetness
a
little
hint
of
skunkyness
that
might
be
intentional
not
a
whole
lot
going
on
its
just
a
euro
lager
drinkability
another
typical
boring
euro
i
am
looking
for
one
of
these
to
really
stand
out
from
the
crowd
but
they
are
few
and
far
between
musings
very
drinkable
beer
seems
to
have
more
depth
that
other
euros
i
wont
keep
it
at
home
but
will
order
again
out
in
all
aspects
this
is
your
standard
massproduced
pilsner
but
a
good
one
bright
color
lasting
head
with
a
bit
of
lace
minimal
skunkiness
to
the
nose
and
a
sharp
crisp
taste
this
got
panned
by
several
here
but
in
terms
of
a
straight
up
everyday
pilsner
i
thought
it
better
than
most
us
representations
of
the
style
presentation
packaged
in
a
twelve
ounce
green
glass
eurostyle
longneck
with
a
popoff
crown
served
in
a
standard
pint
tap
glass
overall
less
that
what
id
like
to
see
but
worth
a
try
might
try
this
one
on
some
macro
drinkers
to
see
what
they
think
poured
a
very
pale
yellow
fizzy
head
dissipated
quickly
to
light
lacing
carbonation
level
moderate
to
heavy
smells
like
weak
hops
and
barley
just
like
any
typical
macro
light
beer
tastes
like
watered
down
hops
very
bland
and
slightly
bitter
no
real
mouthfeel
carbonated
water
maybe
hardly
drinkable
i
will
most
likely
not
finish
this
beverage
very
disappointed
in
this
beer
all
around
luckily
purchased
as
a
single
so
i
neednt
pawn
this
off
on
any
friends
drinkability
cant
be
high
when
you
see
there
is
more
beer
left
in
the
bottle
and
youre
disappointed
wont
finish
the
rest
maybe
if
served
very
cold
i
could
drink
one
but
i
dont
look
forward
to
it
if
that
happenes
this
is
a
very
clean
crisp
euro
lager
no
skunkiness
nothing
offensive
light
in
flavor
high
in
carbonation
i
enjoy
one
of
these
once
in
a
while
just
to
picture
myself
sitting
by
the
water
in
portofine
knocking
back
a
cold
peroni
this
is
a
simple
beer
it
wont
impress
but
it
shouldnt
insult
either
the
peroni
poured
a
light
straw
color
with
a
tall
white
head
the
white
head
faded
quickly
and
did
not
lace
on
the
glass
the
smell
was
very
bitter
and
not
appealing
it
actually
smelled
just
like
a
heineken
the
taste
matched
the
smell
no
signs
of
malt
character
and
a
very
bitter
taste
i
do
not
know
what
hops
are
in
this
beer
but
they
are
not
pleasant
and
have
a
tannin
type
bite
there
was
also
a
corn
or
rice
aftertaste
the
beer
was
very
watery
and
i
do
not
think
i
could
have
had
more
than
the
one
not
recommended
overall
a
very
thirst
quenching
beer
but
nothing
special
since
it
tase
like
any
other
american
macro
but
comes
with
a
higher
price
since
its
from
italy
i
got
this
one
at
an
italian
restaurant
in
little
italy
with
my
seafood
dinner
not
too
bad
poured
a
light
yellow
straw
color
with
a
small
white
head
no
lacing
not
much
in
the
smell
department
grainy
the
taste
was
ok
a
little
to
watery
for
me
it
had
a
straw
malt
flavor
to
it
very
light
mouthfeel
so
if
you
do
appreciate
this
beer
you
can
drink
a
bunch
of
them
at
one
sitting
i
guess
if
your
trying
to
get
into
new
beers
and
your
a
fan
of
heineken
then
you
might
want
to
try
this
one
based
on
the
fact
that
this
was
not
much
more
than
water
i
would
say
it
was
fairly
drinkable
especially
with
my
spicey
fra
diavlo
i
wont
be
clamoring
for
more
the
body
is
light
which
is
on
for
style
a
bit
watery
but
some
malt
notes
do
linger
overall
this
is
note
a
good
beer
beyond
the
yeast
skunk
and
limited
taste
there
really
isnt
many
positives
to
talk
about
this
is
terrible
no
other
way
to
describe
it
its
fresh
dated
040406
id
hate
to
try
it
when
its
gone
bad
light
yellow
color
and
a
weak
white
foam
head
some
lace
medium
level
of
carbonation
aromas
of
cheap
adjuncts
and
old
meat
sick
taste
was
weak
and
watery
with
only
hints
of
malt
and
hops
mouthfeel
was
there
any
drinkability
is
poor
i
dont
know
if
i
can
finish
this
was
a
drinkable
beer
not
a
favorite
and
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
it
but
given
the
limited
selection
available
at
the
restaurant
it
wasnt
a
bad
option
i
will
probably
avoid
this
unless
im
in
italy
clear
light
gold
head
holds
for
a
while
looks
pretty
decent
in
my
peroni
weizen
glass
but
even
the
glassware
cant
save
this
beer
euroskunk
aroma
with
some
light
fruit
smells
in
the
background
tastes
of
grassy
herbal
hops
with
a
hint
of
bready
malt
light
mouthfeel
surprisingly
subdued
carbonation
easy
drinker
fairly
typical
eurolager
nothing
thatd
stop
traffic
thats
for
sure
i
dont
like
this
beer
wont
be
buying
it
again
sierra
nevada
summerfest
or
stella
artois
are
a
lot
better
than
this
for
the
style

1
inch

good
continual
carbonation
smell
is
faint
malt
with
some
mild
hoppiness
and
a
bit
of
that
ballpark
swill
element
this
is
like
a
budweiser
of
italy
nothing
special
but
better
than
most
american
swill
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
these
but
might
order
one
at
an
italian
restaurant
overall
your
typical
crappy
eurolager
it
was
worthwhile
at
the
time
since
it
was
probably
a
better
match
for
my
chickengoat
cheesepesto
pizza
than
some
cheap
red
wines
on
the
menu
i
wouldnt
waste
the
time
to
come
back
to
this
one
typical

typical
not

this
one
came
to
me
in
a
12
oz
green
bottle
whic
is
completely
par
for
the
course
when
it
comes
to
this
style
of
brew
i
poured
it
into
a
standard
pint
glass
after
finally
receiving
a
nonfrosted
one
from
the
bartender
and
explaining
this
practicess
merits
the
beer
poured
a
pretty
clear
yellow
color
with
not
head
the
aroma
was
instead
more
of
a
smell
a
whole
lot
of
adjuncts
of
some
sort
or
variety
the
taste
was
pretty
adjuncteuro
pale
lager
runofthemill
sort
of
stuff
the
same
sort
of
thing
ive
said
about
the
majority
of
aspects
and
facets
to
this
beer
the
flavor
consisted
of
some
malt
with
a
very
very
thin
to
nonexistent
hop
presence
its
simply
average
but
could
have
been
improved
with
a
significant
amount
of
more
hoppiness
this
beer
is
a
light
beer
both
mouthfeel
and
flavor
drinkability
for
this
one
is
about
average
the
abv
makes
it
possible
to
sit
around
a
knock
a
few
of
these
back
in
a
sitting
but
the
beer
experience
of
it
would
make
me
want
to
reach
for
something
else
entirely
still
better
in
my
opinion
than
other
euro
lagers
although
this
is
not
saying
much
drinkable
and
im
sure
this
would
pair
well
with
an
antipasto
plate
with
italian
cheeses
standing
on
its
own
its
a
vey
mediocre
euro
pale
lager
it
is
pretty
much
you
typical
supermarket
available
european
lagerbut
it
is
not
as
sweet
as
many
and
just
feels
and
tastes
pleasant
it
went
pretty
well
with
a
pizza
true
the
sweet
simple
grain
maltiness
is
the
dominant
note
of
this
beer
it
is
quite
close
to
drinking
water
and
is
quite
devoid
of
off
flavors
which
is
good
for
a
beer
this
light
or
character
for
that
matter
which
is
disappointingly
true
of
beers
from
this
genre
what
can
i
say
this
is
quenching
and
quite
quaffable
if
it
remains
cold
certainly
not
bad
but
devoid
of
character
life
the
beer
pours
a
pale
yellow
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
light
pale
malt
scent
along
with
a
clean
crisp
lager
yeast
aroma
its
dry
with
some
green
bottle
character
the
taste
is
average
it
has
a
dry
pale
malt
and
adjunct
flavor
that
is
devoid
of
any
real
malt
taste
it
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
clean
with
a
lager
yeast
aftertaste
yuk
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
it
is
a
low
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
an
easy
drinker
but
im
not
going
to
be
having
any
more
of
these
there
is
no
malt
flavor
its
one
and
done
for
me
typical
american
wannabe
of
a
real
euro
lager
average
appearence
a
bit
weak
on
smell
light
bodied
quite
light
bodied
as
a
matter
of
fact
better
than
anheiser
world
select
but
still
not
as
good
as
my
champion
beer
for
this
type
of
flavor
beck
although
they
are
different
styles
technicly
this
beer
is
coppied
of
the
style
of
euro
lagers
this
is
a
good
beer
overall
descent
flavor
for
being
light
and
easy
to
drink
reminds
of
your
typical
euro
lager
straw
grain
and
hay
quality
in
the
mouthfeel
snappy
foriegn
hops
on
the
finish
drinkable
at
anytime
but
not
a
main
choice
pale
gold
lots
of
upcharging
bubbles
but
not
enough
to
replenish
the
skeletal
macro
head
that
sits
on
top
laces
are
simple
some
strings
on

side
of
the
glass
slightly
sweet

sweet
grass
light
citrus
mouthfeel
is
overcarbonated
and
not
happening
in
any
real

flavor
starts
totally
mediocre
a
bit
of
lemon
and
really
bland
brown
sugar
and
is
then
defeated
by
the
overly
charged
texture
hops
are
left
behind
as
the
citrus
fades
into
a
sucroselike
sweetness
and
a
bit
of
water
nothing
is
jarring
or
horribly
nasty
about
this
brew
nothing
is
there
to
help
build
a
foundation
of
a
memorable
beer
either
reasonably
refreshing
pale
yellow
color
with
a
white
thin
lace
for
a

the
aroma
is
clean
with
a
touch
of

the
taste
is
light
and
smooth
there
is
a
light
maltiness
and
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
has
a
faint
hoppy
spice
to
it
the
aftertaste
is
semi
dry
and
clean
all
i
can
say
is
that
this
lager
is
crisp
and
very
easy
to
drink
the
ultimate
beer
to
pair
with
any
pizza
or
pasta
appearance
is
pale
yellow
no
foam
and
no
lace
aroma
has
what
i
call
that
barely
barley
lack
of
aroma
initial
taste
is
of
barely
malt
barely
hops
and
barely
sweet
not
much
flavor
but
leaves
a
nicely
clean
palate

which
translates
into
a
good
beer
with
a
meal
of

what
else

italian
food
i
found
this
beer
as
another
typical
mediterranean
quencher
not
bad
but
not
exceptional
in
any
way
either
this
beer
pours
a
clear
yellow
with
an
impressive
head
lacing
and
head
remain
to
the
last
sip
the
taste
is
not
unlike
other
euro
lagers
bitter
and
hoppy
carbonation
muffles
the
taste
and
makes
this
beer
fairly
smooth
and
drinkable
however
i
would
choose
a
less
expensive
beer
to
enjoy
in
the
sun
which
is
this
beers
intended
style
hmm
go
to
an
italian
restaurant
gotta
try
an
italian
beer
poured
clear
gold
with
a
white
quickly
receding
fine
head
i
gotta
wonder
if
my
sense
of
smell
is
affected
by
my
allergies
since
i
cant
really
pick
up
scents
too
good
lately
anyway
taste
was
like
a
typical
american
macro
but
it
seemed
more
refined
and
consistant
went
well
with
a
huge
plate
of
fried
calamari
i
had
not
a
special
beer
experience
in
any
way
but
an
enjoyable
one
none
the
less
this
may
be
the
most
bitter
lagerlight
lager
ive
ever
tasted
perhaps
relentless
ropy
bitterness
is
what
industrial
lager
needs
to
make
it
sustainably
drinkable
let
me
think
its
possible
i
guess
the
first
taste
was
surprising
and
unpleasant
stewy
cereal
aromas
and
vague
impressions
of
lemon
and
herb
aromas
were
followed
by
an
intense
grip
of
drying
tannins
these
left
a
chalky
leathery
feel
though
there
was
nothing
dirty
or
impure
about
it
brassy
simple
golden
grain
sugars
are
overwhelmed
by
salivacoagulating
chemistry
this
may
appeal
to
folks
who
are
suspicious
of
sweetness
and
want
a
light
beer
fans
of
overextracted
unsweetened
tea
and
espresso
who
desire
whisperlight
lager
may
want
to
try
this
i
would
like
to
see
this
concept
reworked
with
quality
ingredients
and
more
care
fundamentally
though
this
is
industrial
beer
with
the
kind
of
styling
that
makes
it
irrelevant
in
sweettoothed
north
america
someone
please
confirm
for
me

one
of
these
with
pizza
or
pasta
is
okay
its
just
not
the
beverage
that
made
italy
famous
as
far
as
pale
plain
lagers
go
this
is
not
all
that
bad
it
poured
a
very
clear
yellow
color
with
a
small
bubbly
head
that
falls
to
nothing
the
nose
was
sweet
honeylike
slightly
grainey
but
lacking
a
lot
of
the
lager
character
that
i
dislike
the
flavor
was
a
nice
sweet
with
a
touch
of
grain
but
a
mild
hop
finish
that
i
dont
usually
find
in
lager
beers
nice
the
feel
was
moderate
a
lot
more
than
other
light
colored
lagers
ive
been
exposed
to
overall
this
was
a
nice
addition
to
a
meal
not
filling
but
very
refreshing
this
adjunct
lager
poured
a
light
gold
color
the
head
is
foamy
and
shortlived
and
leaves
a
little
bit
of
lace
the
aroma
is
sweet
with
equal
parts
malt
and
vegetable
smells
the
aroma
is
almost
devoid
of
hops
the
taste
is
very
vegetal
with
lots
of
corn
dms
flavors
and
just
a
little
bit
of
husky
malt
hops
are
also
nearly
nonexistent
in
the
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
frenetically
carbonated
though
still
mundane
this
is
a
beer
i
wont
seek
out
again
ive
had
bad
results
with
italian
beers
one
exception
pioneer
pale
ale
from
roma
brewery
excellent
stuff
thin
mouthfeel
this
beer
if
i
may
call
it
beer
is
to
be
avoided
for
its
stunning
blandness
i
was
very
happy
that
i
was
able
to
pass
the
bottle
on
to
my
fatherinlaw
and
have
to
pour
it
down
the
drain
i
dont
think
that
ill
buy
more
of
this
from
the
bottle
poured
a
nice
golden
color
with
a
meduim
sized
head
that
didnt
last
aroma
light
malts
some
sweetness
flavor
malts
some
sweetness
to
it
a
hint
of
bitterness
with
a
hint
of
skunk
went
ok
with
my
italian
dinner
i
am
glad
it
was
a
speial
for
2
00
poured
an
unimpressive
pale
golden
no
head
or
retention
to
speak
of
smell
was
grainy
and
sweet
typical
eurolager
taste
slight
hops
slight
malt
and
very
unimpressive
watery
mouthfeel
i
guess
this
is
their
equivalent
of
a
budweiser
nothing
to
seek
out
the
beer
poured
a
clear
straw
gold
it
had
a
basic
sour
malt
aroma
the
taste
was
also
of
sour
malt
with
a
banana
finish
it
was
light
and
dry
yet
slightly
oily
this
is
a
solid
decent
beer
that
stacks
up
well
with
other
macros
it
reminded
me
of
ballantines
this
is
nothing
more
than
a
mediocre
beer
i
can
imagine
it
would
be
fine
as
a
thirst
quencher
but
nothing
more
drinkability
my
skunkaverseness
prevents
me
from
actively
pursuing
this
beer
drinkability

this
one
starts
off
well
enough
but
lost
its
structure
and
felt
kind
of
strung
out
to
me
in
the
end
this
particular
lager
has
a
smell
which
is
slightly
skunky
though
not
overwhelming
it
is
similar
in
its
aroma
to
that
of
the
dutch
beers
grolsch
and
heineken
although
the
taste
is
far
from
identical
the
easy
drinking
quality
of
this
particular
brew
makes
it
similar
to
pilsner
urquell
but
even
smoother
not
on
my
todo
list
but
definitely
preferred
over
budweiser
or
miller
any
day
not
exciting
but
theres
surprising
malt
the
head
is
foamy
but
a
bit
irregular
on
an
almost
transparent
golden
color
body
the
smell
i
found
hard
to
describe
but
pleasing
enjoyably
grassy
maybe
the
taste
is
ok
quite
refreshing
better
than
many
other
european
lagers
malty
but
not
annoyingly
grainy
round
with
some
caramel
and
some
sweetness
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
a
bit
salted
and
dry
but
not
overly
ok
this
beer
poured
out
a
gold
color
with
some
decent
amount
of
carbonation
in
there
smell
was
a
little
buttery
also
some
skunkiness
to
it
as
well
some
very
light
grain
to
it
but
that
was
about
it
taste
wasnt
all
too
good
either
malts
and
grains
hit
the
palate
very
lightly
some
buttery
aftertaste
kicked
in
as
well
which
made
this
beer
feel
a
little
heavy
to
drink
this
would
probably
beat
out
a
bud
or
corona
well
everything
beats
an
corona
but
not
worth
buying
a
six
pack
of
this
stuff
i
had
this
today
at
uccellos
while
watching
the
euro
championship
finals
the
pour
left
something
to
be
desired
it
had
a
pale
light
color
with
a
fizzy
head
that
dissipated
very
quickly
carbonation
seemed
low
for
a
lager
the
smell
was
definitely
on
the
sweet
side
with
pale
malts
being
noticeable
the
taste
however
seemed
more
hoppy
upfront
there
was
a
definite
grassy
hoppiness
the
dominated
my
palate
with
sweet
malts
coming
in
underneath
the
finish
was
slightly
sweet
and
decently
crisp
this
beer
was
quite
thick
in
body
but
not
too
smooth
it
seemed
like
a
czech
pils
to
me
in
many
ways
all
in
all
i
liked
it
it
goes
without
saying
that
the
italians
are
winedrinkers
and
this
beer
proves
it
nevertheless
i
did
partake
of
this
beer
frequently
as
it
is
absolutely
ubiquitous
in
rome
and
is
often
the
only
andor
best
choice
the
head
is
fizzy
and
quickly
dissipated
to
nothing
there
was
a
straw
dried
grain
flavor
throughout
with
no
real
detectable
hops
and
very
little
malty
quality
it
smells
much
the
same
way
it
tastes
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
the
drinkability
is
this
beers
saving
grace
i
would
certainly
choose
this
beer
over
a
budweiser
or
anything
of
that
ilk
only
linger
here
is
the
tail
end
of
the
skunk
drinkabilty
a
fine
session
beer
if
you
just
want
to
drink
a
lot
but
not
a
beer
i
can
see
drinking
again
clear
greenish
gold
under
a
slightly
contoured
snow
white
one
finger
head
that
fades
very
quickly
to
nothing
but
collar
the
nose
is
nasty
rusty
tin
can
and
corn
the
mouth
is
a
bit
heavy
with
sourness
and
fairly
well
carbonated
the
taste
is
comprised
of
sour
grapes
stale
bread
and
rusted
metal
the
rusted
metal
wins
the
battle
for
the
aftertaste
this
reminds
me
of
way
too
many
bad
macros
perhaps
the
sink
will
enjoy
it
more
than
i
have
the
pour
was
golden
yellow
with
absolutely
no
head
and
nothing
left
on
the
glass
there
seemed
to
be
a
total
lack
of
smell
save
a
slight
hint
of
fruit
the
taste
im
sorry
i
have
to
rank
behind
budweiser
there
was
to
me
a
total
lack
of
taste
it
bordered
on
carbonated
water
but
on
the
same
lines
it
was
refreshing
and
had
good
mouthfeel
i
wont
be
stocking
this
one
for
lawnmowing
season
or
any
other
season
for
that
matter
a
fair
macro
lager
drinkable
but
not
exactly
pushing
the
tastebuds
as
soon
as
johnny
carinos
realizes
that
chicken
picatta
is
supposed
to
have
lemon
in
it
ill
visit
them
again
if
and
when
i
do
ill
sample
this
brew
again
overall
it
was
a
decent
beer
nothing
too
special
but
one
can
certainly
do
much
worse
medium
mouthfeel
with
an
easy
clean
finish
makes
for
a
drinkable
beer
drinkability
overall
it
can
be
done
pretty
good
beer
beeter
than
alot
of
the
american
pale
lagers
the
mildly
applied
hops
have
a
light
lemony
bitterness
and
mild
metallic
bite
lots
of
fizzy
seltzery
carbonation
would
improve
greatly
if
drank
on
the
isle
of
corsica
golden
color
a
shade
darker
than
you
would
expect
fresh
cut
grass
and
snappy
hop
smell
inviting
fresh
tasting
lager
flavors
undertones
of
bready
malt
hints
of
grass
and
tasty
bitter
hopping
in
the
finish
i
dont
know
if
its
saaz
or
what
tastes
like
a
very
traditional
european
lager
without
the
nasty
skunky
smell
light
to
moderate
body
very
crisp
and
refreshing
finish
paired
nicely
with
a
big
bowl
of
pasta
fagoli
and
chicken
parmagiana
i
would
have
it
again
here
but
would
go
searching
for
it
straw
colored
with
a
fizzy
white
head
that
quickly
vanished
nose
of
faint
malt
gentle
sulphur
and
grass
very
light
malt
and
hop
flavors
begin
sweet
and
finish
with
a
dry
grain
and
a
timid
hops
bite
refreshing
and
crisp
a
great
thirst
quencher
mouthfeel
is
light
and
thin
very
easy
drinking
good
lager
to
pair
with
pasta
or
pizza
but
not
something
i
would
drink
on
a
regular
basis
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
here
but
this
is
a
beer
that
goes
nicely
with
pizza
straw
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
that
dissapates
quickly
smell
is
very
mild
of
pils
type
malt
and
faint
hop
aroma
which
i
assume
may
be
a
hallertau
or
hallertau
derived
variety
pale
malt
and
hop
flavors
are
easy
on
the
tongue
and
goes
down
easy
paired
nicely
with
the
straight
tomato
and
mozzarella
pie
at
grimaldis
balances
the
brick
oven
crust
i
wouldnt
have
one
of
these
as
a
sitdown
beer
of
choice
as
i
waited
for
my
seat
at
the
restaurant
i
ordered
a
snpa
in
fact
but
peroni
lager
did
pair
up
pretty
well
with
the
pasta
white
sauce
dish
i
had
for
dinner
all
i
can
really
say
in
closing
is
considering
this
is
italys
flagship
beer
no
wonder
they
have
a
bad
name
when
it
comes
to
brewing
an
absolute
barry
crocker
well
ill
try
to
put
it
in
the
simplest
terms
pours
a
lager
like
clear
golden
tone
with
a
lager
like
white
head
that
fades
a
lager
like
malty
and
hoppy
smell
with
a
lager
like
weakness
a
lager
like
dry
malty
taste
with
some
bitterness
right
at
the
end
that
combines
with
the
lager
like
carbonation
cheers
this
is
a
pale
lager
and
a
mediocre
one
as
well
drinkable
but
forgettable
imported
bottle
so
what
makes
it
an
italian
beer
this
and
moretti
suggest
a
bit
more
hop
bitterness
in
a
light
lager
i
had
this
cold
that
is
i
was
cold
at
an
outdoor
miniitalian
fest
in
chicago
in
october
nice
golden
color
under
a
thin
but
persistent
head
i
can
taste
the
malt
balanced
by
an
agreeable
hop
bitterness
and
yeast
bite
noticeably
more
body
to
it
than
youd
expect
and
finishes
well
matches
well
with
a
hot
buona
beef
sammich
this
beer
poured
crystal
clear
and
was
straw
yellow
colored
great
carbonation
present
the
head
that
was
present
was
the
consistency
of
a
pillow
fluffy
full
and
white
in
color
the
retention
was
very
good
and
lasted
till
approx
glass
before
falling
to
a
light
film
and
a
semithick
ring
on
the
edges
there
was
lace
present
spotty
and
seemed
to
be
kind
of
watery
the
aromas
that
came
from
the
glass
were
light
on
the
nose
light
hops
floral
some
citrus
notes
and
malt
waves
both
sweet
and
semicaramel
all
intertwined
in
the
nose
the
taste
was
semisweet
on
the
tongue
tones
of
sweet
malts
citrus
grains
floral
hops
and
finished
with
a
bread
taste
the
aftertaste
was
a
mix
of
light
hops
and
bread
not
overly
lasting
and
slowly
disappears
after
a
few
moments
lightmedium
bodied
this
was
a
fairly
crisp
and
clean
alittle
on
the
sweeter
side
then
crisp
but
a
drinkable
beer
i
was
surprised
on
how
refreshing
it
was
i
would
have
liked
the
aromas
and
flavors
to
be
slightly
more
pronounced
but
overall
not
to
bad
i
believe
this
beer
could
go
with
any
occasion
and
would
be
a
good
choice
when
out
to
dinner
i
had
this
beer
at
a
pretty
nice
italian
place
with
a
shrimp
scampi
and
great
garlic
bread
and
it
was
my
first
italian
beer
maybe
it
was
the
atmosphere
or
the
butteriness
of
the
food
but
i
enjoyed
the
beer
with
the
meal
the
aroma
reminded
me
faintly
of
white
grapes
almost
winelike
even
the
color
was
a
light
yellow
that
looked
decent
in
the
glass
though
the
head
was
pretty
weak
it
started
smooth
and
had
a
bit
of
a
dry
hoppy
bite
at
the
end
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
wasnt
extremely
impressed
either
this
serving
was
5
2
abv
poured
from
a
green
bottle
it
was
a
clear
pale
gold
small
frothy
head
that
dropped
in
a
short
amount
of
time
left
small
traces
of
lacing
smell
was
not
pleasant
at
all
it
was
a
chemical
skunkiness
that
made
me
think
of
assembly
lines
and
industrial
factories
flavour
possessed
a
crisp
graininess
a
bit
of
skunk
and
finished
very
dry
i
will
pass
on
this
one
just
finished
one
of
these
with
my
lunch
at
my
favorite
pizza
place
in
the
n
end
rough
day
at
work
typical
eurolager
appearance
and
aroma
clear
golden
yellow
faint
smell
of
sulfur
average
head
dissipates
quickly
taste
is
clean
with
no
strong
flavors
mellow
cereal
and
grain
malts
touch
of
spicy
hopsthankfully
no
skunk
much
better
than
a
heineken
or
u
s
macro
swill
but
still
pretty
average
at
best
great
beer
to
wash
down
some
pizza
with
on
a
lunch
break
beer
had
a
very
smooth
and
creamy
mouthfeel
easy
drinking
italian
offering
here
went
great
with
the
italian
beef
fried
chicken
i
had
i
was
not
expecting
much
but
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
how
decent
this
beer
was
had
big
expectations
for
this
beer
but
they
were
not
fulfilled
reminded
me
much
of
heineken
skunky
and
watered
down
pours
a
yellowamber
color
straw
with
a
small
head
and
no
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
was
a
little
skunky
and
had
some
grains
underneath
the
flavor
was
much
like
the
aroma
a
little
skunky
with
a
hint
of
malts
and
grains
and
soem
small
hints
of
fruit
nothing
wonderful
here
not
a
bad
drink
but
not
a
very
good
one
had
this
one
at
the
olive
garden
you
know
that
awesome
authentic
italian
restraunt
not
its
ok
but
ive
eaten
much
better
anyways
nothing
special
about
the
beer
at
all
i
think
it
was
like
a
stronger
corona
it
had
a
hoppy
smell
with
a
tinge
of
skunk
the
taste
was
very
similar
at
the
bottom
though
there
was
a
hint
of
a
honeylike
taste
im
not
going
to
go
ape
nuts
over
it
and
i
doubt
i
will
have
it
again
all
in
all
a
pleasant
beer
the
taste
is
that
of
a
pretty
solid
pale
lager
perhaps
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
as
a
beer
in
general
its
not
that
great
but
for
its
style
theres
just
so
many
dreadfully
foul
brews
in
this
catagory
that
whenever
i
find
one
thats
drinkable
im
thankful
i
almost
hate
to
admit
it
but
i
kinda
like
this
one
drink
up
buddies
tastewise
this
is
almost
like
a
light
beer
if
the
flavor
thats
there
was
a
little
stronger
this
would
be
a
pretty
decent
beer
otherwise
this
is
a
good
hotweather
beer
that
is
refreshing
but
dont
expect
anything
else
out
of
this
inoffensive
but
pretty
tasteless
pat
much
better
alternatives
are
out
there
but
this
is
a
decent
choice
with
little
hop
aroma
or
bitterness
i
wasnt
surprised
that
it
hadnt
skunked
it
wasnt
much
different
than
a
typical
american
lager
tasted
like
a
massproduced
beer
not
that
it
shouldnt
i
look
at
this
beer
an
alternative
to
becks
heinken
etc
if
you
look
at
it
as
a
beer
made
for
the
hot
months
and
meant
to
be
cosumed
whithout
much
thought
while
eating
something
that
takes
almost
your
full
attention
then
this
beer
is
fine
sort
of
thin
looking
lager
with
that
european
malt
flavor
it
really
tastes
like
an
average
mass
produced
german
beerr
just
a
little
thinner
not
much
else
to
say
but
certainly
is
drinkable
poured
a
medium
straw
golden
blond
with
a
medium
head
lots
of
carbonation
and
ok
lace
had
this
on
at
a
local
restaurant
its
taste
was
pilsner
like
clean
crisp
and
not
a
lot
of
complexity
not
that
a
lack
of
complexity
is
bad
very
mild
malt
and
hop
flavors
somewhat
watery
i
think
this
is
a
slightly
below
average
beer
due
to
its
wateryness
but
it
went
great
with
the
garlic
breadstix
and
the
seafood
i
had
for
my
meal
pours
a
straw
color
gold
with
a
nice
tight
white
head
the
head
lasted
quite
some
time
and
gave
way
to
patchy
lacing
the
aroma
was
grassy
with
hints
of
grain
and
malt
the
taste
matches
the
aroma
with
a
nice
dry
crisp
finish
a
refreshing
beer
to
drink
on
a
hot
day
this
is

is

bittering
hops
that
are
wellbalanced
reminds
me
of
steinlager
in
many
ways
alcohol
is
very
mild
and
clean
and
hardly
noticeable
a
decent
pilsener
color
is
a
clear
medium
yellow
with
a
fluffy
white
head
that
was
about
a
finger
high
has
some
divets
and
left
small
clingy
lacing
smell
is
faint
of
sweet
malt
and
grain
and
a
bit
of
floral
hop
taste
is
clean
and
lightly
sweet
of
malt
with
a
bit
of
drying
crisp
hop
thats
very
subtle
nice
over
all
light
and
sweet
body
with
a
easy
smoothness
thats
pretty
drinkable
with
a
slightly
crispy
dryness
in
the
finish
which
can
help
settle
any
garlicy
pizza
a
very
good
pizza
pasta
brew
it
pours
clear
pale
gold
with
a
white
head
that
settles
to
a
thin
film
lace
is
fair
with
mild
carbonation
the
aroma
is
not
overpowering
but
of
mild
malt
grain
the
taste
is
crisp
clean
refreshing
the
body
is
not
to
heavy
and
thats
agood
leave
the
heavy
to
the
dish
of
pasta
or
pitz
chase
the
hot
pepper
with
the
peroni
i
like
to
stock
this
at
home
for
such
times
munga
quite
impressive
brew
by
the
italians
tried
this
in
an
italian
restaurant
with
my
carbonara
i
must
admitt
it
was
an
excellent
choice
very
refreshing
and
drinkable
enjoying
your
pasta
with
this
beer
is
surely
a
great
combination
slightly
better
than
the
standard
european
lagers
found
in
light
coloured
bottles
it
poured
a
golden
brown
color
with
very
little
head
which
was
completely
gone
after
about
a
minute
the
carbonation
was
basically
non
existant
also
no
bubbles
what
so
ever
the
smell
is
one
of
the
few
good
things
bout
this
beer
it
is
quite
strong
and
is
like
what
a
real
lager
should
be
at
first
taste
it
seemed
pretty
good
but
after
that
it
tasted
much
like
water
almost
worse
than
bud
and
miller
with
the
lack
of
carbonation
mouthfeel
is
mediocre
too
with
all
that
said
i
dont
think
this
a
very
good
beer
at
all
it
says
its
the
no
1
beer
in
italy
but
since
bud
makes
that
claim
here
in
the
us
one
can
see
a
lot
of
similarities
between
the
two
pours
with
a
moderate
white
head
atop
a
medium
golden
body
the
head
quickly
fades
to
a
layer
of
thin
foam
the
aroma
is
a
grassy
herbal
note
with
just
a
hint
of
malt
and
a
slight
background
of
pepper
the
taste
if
fairly
straightforward
with
just
a
note
of
sweetness
and
a
slight
hint
of
bitterness
on
the
finish
a
metallic
note
dominates
the
aftertatse
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
harsh
with
the
carbonation
attacking
the
roof
of
my
mouth
through
the
rather
thin
body
of
the
beer
as
such
the
harsh
mouthfeel
coupled
with
the
weak
aroma
and
uninspiring
flavor
hurt
the
drinkability
this
is
close
to
the
budweiser
of
italy
im
sure
maybe
it
was
because
of
the
green
bottle
or
maybe
it
was
because
of
the
way
it
was
stored
this
beer
had
a
off
smell
and
taste
it
was
oxidized
i
think
the
beer
was
very
clear
and
a
bright
yellow
the
carbonation
clung
to
the
side
of
the
glass
my
wife
said
it
looked
more
like
gingerale
than
beer
because
it
was
so
carbonated
the
head
was
generous
and
white
everything
was
going
well
until
i
raised
the
glass
to
my
mouth
the
aroma
was
poor
and
the
flavor
that
followed
matched
the
smell
i
might
try
another
at
another
restuarant
to
see
if
i
might
change
my
mind
a
light
gold
yellow
when
poured
fair
amount
of
lace
in
the
glass
excellent
carbonation
resulting
in
bubbles
rising
up
my
glass
a
very
crisp
and
refreshing
lightly
malted
and
hopped
italian
lager
very
basic
and
not
very
complex
not
very
filling
when
eating
a
rich
italian
meal
i
would
never
buy
this
other
than
dinning
out
at
the
olive
garden
taste
isnt
much
kinda
skunky
on
the
finish
due
to
my
italian
descent
i
have
always
been
pretty
fond
of
this
beer
it
like
many
other
european
lagers
contains
that
simplicity
of
flavor
that
is
smooth
and
refreshing
the
golden
color
complements
the
frothy
white
head
so
well
the
mild
sulfur
aroma
along
with
faint
malts
and
hops
are
balanced
with
the
smooth
crisp
taste
of
the
lager
very
refreshing
and
the
reason
that
italy
is
known
for
their
wine
and
not
beer
why
do
these
companies
like
stella
artois
heineken
and
grolsch
along
with
peroni
continue
with
the
green
bottles
i
would
like
to
taste
this
same
beer
fresh
from
the
brewery
pours
a
clear
pale
straw
color
with
a
decent
white
head
that
quickly
dissappears
and
leaves
little
lace
fairly
clean
aroma
with
some
grain
and
skunk
light
in
body
and
fizzy
on
the
tounge
this
brew
is
overly
carbonated
like
a
soda
starts
with
a
grainy
malt
sweetness
with
some
cirtus
hop
flavor
coming
through
along
with
a
slightly
skunky
character
finishes
crisp
with
some
spicy
hops
dry
and
a
lasting
bitterness
needs
less
carbonation
and
skunk
and
more
flavor
nothing
very
exceptional
about
this
beer
a
lager
in
taste
in
and
in
texture
i
enjoy
it
at
italian
restraunts
but
i
prefer
the
moretti
this
is
a
bit
hoppy
but
the
hop
balance
has
a
bit
to
be
desired
there
is
a
harshness
to
the
hops
that
takes
away
from
how
good
this
beer
could
be
this
one
is
good
with
food
but
not
a
stand
alone
beer
medium

soon
dissipates
into

up

the
taste
with
a
bit
of
an
acidic
lemon
sting
to
follow
crisp
and
dry
in
the
finish
i
generally
enjoy
a
nice
chianti
with
pasta
but
this
beer
would
do
well
in
a
pinch
my
first
italian
made
beer
and
mabey
my
last
poured
a
clear
golden
with
lots
of
bubbles
from
carbonation
head
was
white
and
foamy
aroma
consisted
of
hops
and
a
sweet
malt
scent
body
was
thin
and
a
bit
watery
crisp
and
tingly
up
front
the
taste
was
pretty
smooth
with
a
sweet
malt
finish
not
a
bad
beer
but
nothing
spectacular
either
nice
one
the
best
way
i
can
put
this
is
this
is
not
in
sa
boston
lager
territory
but
it
is
considerably
better
than
most
every
day
lagers
smells
slightly
skunked
at
first
pour
as
most
imported
lagers
tend
to
smell
it
came
in
a
green
bottle
and
off
the
discount
rack
with
no
date
on
it
so
i
am
slightly
spooked
at
first
but
it
really
tastes
just
fine
a
sweeter
style
lager
with
a
nice
smooth
creamy
mouthfeel
golden
in
color
clean
and
clear
looking
finishes
on
a
slight
dry
note
has
some
of
those
european
lager
hop
characteristics
in
the
flavor
id
drink
it
for
a
change
of
pace
with
some
pizza
or
something
i
wouldnt
buy
a
six
pack
but
one
with
dinner
at
an
italian
restaurant
is
a
good
alternative
if
you
dont
like
wine
nothing
special
here
but
not
bad
either
i
much
prefer
it
over
a
heineken
or
grolsch
or
the
like
a
basic
lager
that
pairs
well
with
any
italian
meal
a
good
one
to
have
when
your
just
looking
for
something
simple
back
to
the
beer
its
fair
moretti
has
more
taste
or
just
grab
a
yeungling
eating
pizza
in
bostons
north
end
i
need
a
beer
to
drink
ordered
this
smooth
light
colored
and
taste
with
just
a
hint
of
hops
goes
well
with
food
but
not
enough
of
a
bite
for
this
mick
closest
thing
i
will
drink
to
a
light
happy
drinking
i
wish
the
1
beer
in
american
tasted
as
good
as
italys
1
beer
i
have
the
sinking
suspicion
that
any
1
in
its
country
beer
is
awful
coincidentally
this
tastes
as
bad
as
the
1
beer
in
the
usa
as
such
i
doubt
i
will
ever
bother
with
it
again
ehhhhhh
i
cant
really
say
anything
too
much
about
this
one
it
is
a
little
skunky
slightly
bitter
but
it
really
is
not
too
bad
not
as
good
as
a
pauli
girl
or
a
heine
but
i
dont
like
them
too
much
either
i
wasnt
all
that
impressed
with
this
one
doesnt
smell
great
and
the
aftertaste
is
similiar
to
the
smell
too
much
carbonation
too
i
had
a
few
bottles
with
some
italian
food
only
because
my
other
choice
was
budweiser
italy
has
better
beverages
to
offer
a
decent
lager
at
best
pale
gold
with
a
slight
quickly
dissapating
head
very
carbonated
spritzy
mouthfeel
this
beer
had
a
touch
of
malt
with
no
obvious
adjunct
off
flavors
and
a
balancing
bitterness
which
is
saying
something
for
a
foreign
macro
lager
pick
this
over
flavorless
pale
yellow
domestic
macroswill
to
eat
your
pasta
with
if
there
are
no
other
interesting
beers
to
be
had
slightly
sweet
nose
with
a
very
carbonated
appearence
very
pale
fluffy
head
slight
sweetness
in
the
taste
with
not
alot
of
body
to
the
brew
seems
watery
and
weak
i
had
a
moretti
before
this
one
and
they
dont
compare
have
the
moretti
when
given
the
choice
the
peroni
is
over
force
carbonated
and
lacks
any
real
malt
or
hops
character
clear
light
golden
hue
w
a
large
bubbled
head
that
settles
relatively
quickly
grainy
notes
and
light
biscuit
in
aroma
the
grassy
saaz
nose
is
mild
and
understated
but
thankfully
devoid
of
skunky
mercaptans
hop
bitterness
and
grain
huskiness
hit
the
palette
at
first
and
are
ensued
by
a
clean
and
mild
malt
sweetness
hop
flavor
is
absent
very
lightly
bodied
w
a
fairly
prickly
mouthfeel
from
the
high
carbonation
finishes
clean
and
bit
bland
theres
nothing
outstanding
flavorwise
but
peroni
is
well
balanced
and
makes
for
an
crisp
innocuous
thirst
quencher
a
pleasant
surprise
i
think
this
beer
is
way
overated
everyone
seems
to
love
it
but
i
struggle
to
find
anything
interesting
about
it
fizzy
yellow
beer
with
not
muc
flavour
slightly
sweet
aswell
not
my
style
not
bad
had
one
at
an
italian
restaruant
a
bit
back
it
was
a
little
dry
but
i
was
eating
pasta
at
the
time
so
it
went
down
pretty
well
strong
flavour
btw
it
doesnt
say
it
but
if
i
remember
correctly
the
abv
was
5
2
this
beer
goes
well
with
italian
food
because
it
does
not
have
too
many
flavors
to
get
in
the
way
a
notch
above
bud
and
thats
not
saying
much
it
had
a
somewhat
buttery
diacetyl
flavor
to
it
but
i
cant
be
sure
because
i
tasted
it
toward
the
middle
of
the
meal
at
any
rate
it
is
not
a
bad
euro
pilsnerlager
but
it
is
not
worth
paying
34bottle
for
in
a
restaurant
or
8sixpack
the
other
beer
i
had
that
night
was
a
moretti
before
the
salad
arrived
it
did
not
taste
fresh
too
bad
because
when
its
fresh
moretti
pilsner
actually
has
hop
flavor
and
aroma
that
the
peroni
lacks
i
have
to
admit
this
beer
surprised
me
i
dont
have
a
high
opinion
of
lagers
as
a
whole
mainly
because
most
of
them
dont
stand
out
but
this
beer
stuck
in
my
mind
the
biggest
aspect
is
its
sweetness
unusually
sweet
for
a
lager
but
its
great
for
drinking
with
a
meal
i
noticed
some
citrusy
almost
lemonlike
hints
with
my
first
taste
but
i
was
either
imagining
things
or
my
taste
buds
quickly
lost
that
flavor
this
is
a
highly
fermented
golden
beer
it
was
crisp
and
clear
but
not
outstanding
my
impression
is
an
american
pilsner
thats
much
more
refined
maybe
less
rice
and
adjuncts
although
the
italians
arent
known
for
their
beer
this
one
does
just
fine
good
ice
cold
and
pleasantly
malty
as
it
warms
molto
bene
overall
a
pretty
average
lager
oh
and
im
not
a
big
wine
drinker
so
i
always
order
a
beer
with
my
meals
and
i
figure
if
im
going
to
eat
italian
ill
drink
italian
peroni
does
the
job
everytime
although
its
not
something
id
keep
in
the
fridge
at
home
very
light
malty
taste
alright
the
most
common
italian
beer
nothing
to
see
or
taste
here
the
only
italian
beer
that
i
tried
i
am
neutral
on
this
beer
crisp
and
clean
not
complex
flavors
just
an
okay
italian
lager
not
one
of
my
favorites
the
appearance
was
a
clear
yellow
color
with
a
soft
one
finger
white
foamy
head
that
quickly
dies
down
to
a
film
in
the
center
of
the
beer
the
smell
had
some
cooked
corn
with
a
cereal
like
content
the
taste
was
somewhat
sweet
for
what
was
there
on
the
nose
and
palate
this
was
somewhat
of
a
macro
brew
skunk
with
a
watery
corn
aftertaste
the
beer
is
clear
and
golden
with
an
inch
of
white
head
the
aroma
is
weak
offering
grains
malt
sweetness
crisp
and
clean
refreshing
though
too
grainy
notes
of
corn
and
sweet
alcohol
a
beer
for
the
masses
or
to
be
consumed
for
free
while
gigging
at
a
place
such
as
this
im
just
glad
guys
like
me
can
drink
beers
like
this
while
playing
music
like
that
for
people
like
them
watery
without
any
real
taste
drinkable
if
ice
cold
not
particularly
nice
it
looks
pretty
good
however
the
aroma
is
a
nonevent
and
the
flavour
is
weak
and
plagued
by
unpleasant
offnotes
average
body
for
the
style
too
much
grain
in
the
flavour
where
is
the
crisp
character
and
spicy
noble
hops
that
distinguish
a
quality
lager
no
need
to
hunt
this
down
spend
your
money
on
something
good
overall
when
in
rome
stick
with
the
wine
this
is
a
great
reason
to
have
limochello
instead
of
an
after
dinner
brew
when
on
the
boot
while
not
flawed
there
is
just
not
much
here
to
hold
your
interest
inoffensive
not
very
good
snap
a
crisp
lager
with
a
crisp
feel
in
the
mouth
closest
cousins
are
its
euro
neighbors
to
the
north
becks
and
st
pauli
girl
peroni
is
the
official
beer
of
olive
garden
order
it
instead
of
their
crummy
wines
that
come
in
a
screwtop
bottle
on
tap
at
an
italian
chain
restaurant
comes
to
the
table
a
clear
straw
yellow
color
with
a
decent
off
white
head
that
leaves
spotty
lacing
smells
of
grainy
malt
a
light
floral
hops
the
flavor
is
as
lackluster
as
the
aroma
light
body
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
and
a
sweet
grainy
mouthfeel
barely
better
than
a
bud
but
technically
defect
free
unless
you
consider
a
lack
of
flavor
a
flaw
a
very
booring
beer
o
this
is
a
very
simple
and
decently
refreshing
beer
and
it
does
not
have
any
major
flaw
among
industrial
pale
lagers
it
almost
feels
like
a
gem

not
special
at
all
but
it
is
funny
that
most
people
dont
know
this
beer
while
they
think
that
the
nastro
azzuro
is
the
one
and
only
peroni
but
this
one
is
the
standard
nonpremium
version
that
is
as
far
as
i
know
not
sold
outside
of
italy
not
much
nose
strong
taste
watery
its
actually
very
close
to
water
but
with
a
bittersweet
side
unpleasant
the
bitterness
in
the
finish
is
it
dirty
and
artificial
which
does
not
give
value
to
the
ordinary
lager
persistent
nonexistent
not
much
to
put
under
the
tongue
even
if
we
take
into
account
that
this
is
just
a
classic
lager
76100
this
is
polands
version
of
a
pale
lager
similar
to
stella
or
harp
etc
its
pretty
decent
and
can
be
a
nice
complement
to
what
is
usually
pretty
heavy
food
if
im
at
a
polish
place
id
get
this
one
and
maybe
try
others
from
this
brewery
as
well
overall
unimpressive
overall
but
i
would
recommend
it
for
a
macro
drinker
looking
for
something
different
within
that
similar
price
range
this
brew
just
need
more
character
in
all
areas
good
for
a
warm
day
barbeque
though
poured
a
dark
gold
color
head
dissipates
quickly
no
carbonation
visible
corn
and
malt
aroma
the
interesting
thing
about
this
beer
is
that
i
get
a
flavor
reminiscent
of
sweet
tea
with
lemon
my
friends
concurred
there
is
the
slightest
hint
of
skunk
flavor
but
primarily
i
get
flavors
of
tea
and
lemon
hit
me
completely
off
guard
poured
from
a
16oz
can
into
a
pint
glass
almost
no
head
but
a
nice
golden
color
aroma
was
of
sweetness
corn
and
malt
with
a
hint
of
alcohol
slightly
sweet
taste
with
a
skunky
after
bite
and
a
mild
malt
finish
mouthfeel
is
wet
at
first
and
then
fizzed
to
a
dry
end
with
a
suprising
bit
of
carbonation
left
flavor
hints
on
the
roof
of
the
mouth
overall
a
nice
euro
lager
that
had
some
flavor
im
sure
there
are
better
and
worse
polish
lagers
to
be
had
and
i
want
to
try
them
o
although
this
beer
is
a
little
sweet
its
not
too
difficult
to
drink
because
any
traces
of
alcohol
are
well
hidden
from
the
taste
its
not
a
bad
beer
for
the
style
because
there
are
no
off
flavors
500
ml
can
bought
at
a
polish
shop
in
arnhem
poured
into
a
guinness
pint
glass
abv
57
golden
yellow
colour
with
one
finger
of
soapy
white
head
with
low
retention
no
lacing
of
course
left
behind
just
a
couple
of
bubbles
in
the
body
typical
macro
lager
aroma
but
very
faint
almost
non
existent
malty
taste
but
only
a
bit
sweet
aftertaste
is
much
sweeter
very
thin
and
watery
body
minimal
carbonation
overall
less
than
average
macro
lager
tasting
beer
very
easily
forgetable
o
just
another
standard
macro
lager
this
is
rather
a
euro
pale
lager
than
a
märzen
absolutely
nothing
to
write
home
about
pours
a
copper
color
super
fluffy
head
low
lacing
glass
light
carbonation
no
real
smell
and
light
mouth
feel
tastes
kinda
flat
cause
of
the
lack
of
carbonation
yet
is
clean
and
smooth
has
a
very
slight
bitterness
at
the
end
preceded
by
a
skunky
syrupy
caramel
flavor
not
the
worst
poland
beer
i
have
ever
had
better
than
most
a
very
clean
and
easy
drinking
beer
that
would
make
for
a
refreshing
picnic
beverage
was
hoping
for
a
bit
more
overall
not
very
intriguing
but
still
a
pretty
solid
and
decent
brew
let
me
preface
things
by
saying
that
im
ignoring
the
current
designation
of
this
beer
and
reviewing
it
as
a
euro
pale
lager
or
something
generally
akin
thereto
ill
explain
later
anyway
it
pours
a
clear
pale
straw
topped
by
over
a
finger
of
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
white
bread
corn
dusty
wheat
and
light
honey
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
a
dull
sweetness
and
a
vague
twang
of
booze
duking
it
out
amidst
the
aforementioned
elements
the
body
is
a
hefty
light
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
mildly
syrupy
feel
overall
a
pretty
meager
beer
in
general
as
a
marzenofest
its
downright
terrible
but
as
a
normal
euro
lager
its
just
mildly
sad
o
as
usual
with
the
polish
standards
it
doesnt
benefit
from
the
slightly
higher
abv
warka
is
far
from
the
worst
example
though
its
still
drinkable
the
taste
is
neither
good
nor
bad
overall
very
drinkable
and
fairly
sweet
o
definitely
a
surprise
that
this
one
isnt
terrible
after
all
i
was
expecting
it
to
be
when
i
bought
a
single
of
it
i
suppose
lower
standards
help
a
decently
drinkable
polish
brew
flaccid
feel
clean
and
dry
aftertaste
apple
and
papery
notes
dominate
pretty
much
like
every
polish
lager
out
there
very
clean
but
one
dimensional
not
much
in
the
way
of
noble
hops
here
they
may
have
already
faded
bottle
not
dated
pretty
dry
clean
and
easy
to
drink
went
well
with
smoked
alpine
sausage
from
genes
also
pours
a
golden
yellow
color
with
1
finger
of
head
that
fades
to
a
ring
with
some
lacing
the
aroma
is
a
mix
of
grainy
malt
and
that
sharp
crispness
common
to
domestic
lagers
it
starts
off
fairly
bland
and
sweet
with
just
some
light
bitterness
on
the
back
end
the
finish
is
fast
and
clean
with
just
a
hint
of
corn
sweetness
the
body
is
slightly
fuller
than
a
typical
macro
lager
and
the
drinkability
is
on
par
with
macros
this
is
a
decent
lager
but
i
would
hardly
call
it
a
marzen
notes
well
i
was
not
expecting
a
fest
beer
when
i
picked
this
one
up
but
there
it
is
i
was
thinking
it
was
going
to
be
more
of
a
czech
pilsener
or
a
euro
lager
but
it
is
well
in
keeping
with
a
good
old
german
fest
beer
dokay
at
best
nice
balance
good
in
a
pinch
and
certainly
thirst
quenching
marzen
this
is
the
latest
addition
the
unusually
wide
range
of
polish
lagers
at
my
local
offlicence
and
one
of
the
most
attractive
so
far
but
its
still
not
going
to
win
any
beauty
pageants
not
with
its
generic
golden
body
and
completely
average
white
head
the
nose
is
noticeably
and
aggressively
alcoholic
smelling
kind
of
like
a
can
of
cheap
cider
without
much
nuance
to
speak
of
save
a
hint
of
sulfur
and
a
touch
of
glue
the
flavor
is
sweet
and
a
bit
thick
so
if
this
style
classification
is
to
be
trusted
then
its
pretty
much
spot
on
but
thats
the
best
that
can
be
said
for
it
it
tastes
like
some
kind
of
lemony
beer
and
rum
concoction
and
thats
how
it
drinks
not
terrible
but
far
from
recommendable
regardless
solid
malts
and
enough
hops
better
than
most
out
of
poland
my
pour
resulted
in
two
fingers
worth
of
thick
foamy
bone
white
head
with
decent
retention
color
was
a
deep
goldenyellow
with
nequality
clarity
bupgoo
nose
had
a
very
saaz
hoppilsner
bite
to
it
i
am
curious
as
to
its
being
an
ofest
mouthfeel
was
slightly
watery
with
a
lagerlike
sweetness
on
the
tongue
i
really
cannot
believe
that
this
is
an
ofest
and
i
have
sent
the
company
an
email
for
clarification
finish
was
mild
unobtrusive
definitely
some
sort
of
lager
maybe
an
ofest
maybe
not
drinkable
sure
cooler
worthy
yes
but
not
worth
seeking
out
it
would
be
a
nice
simple
beer
to
have
with
a
nice
simple
polish
meal
no
question
i
thought
it
more
of
a
euro
pale
lager
than
a
marzenofest
but
i
suppose
the
sweetness
puts
it
into
the
latter
anyway
its
a
rather
bland
sweet
though
drinkable
brew
pours
a
dark
amber
body
wqith
tons
of
carbonation
and
a
huge
off
white
head
aromas
are
caramel
malt
bread
and
some
hops
taste
is
sweet
malts
caramel
some
hops
molasses
smooth
and
creamy
very
dangerous
considering
it
is
7
not
my
favourite
es
but
all
in
all
well
made
and
given
the
high
abv
a
well
made
brew
recieved
a
sixpack
for
my
birthday
immediately
after
pour
smells
like
angelfood
cake
didnt
expect
that
head
disipated
quickly
no
trace
of
lace
and
the
carbonation
left
quickly
taste
is
sweet
and
syrupy
with
caramel
and
some
kind
of
fruit
like
raisins
alcohol
was
prominent
to
me
never
had
anything
like
this
one
glad
i
tried
it
dont
think
id
buy
it
d
just
this
morning
i
was
brewing
up
a
batch
of
pale
ale
homebrew
and
i
happened
to
sample
the
malt
extract
raw
after
i
got
all
i
could
out
of
the
can
and
this
tastes
a
lot
like
that
raw
malty
sweet
and
brany
flavor
i
opened
this
brew
expecting
some
sort
of
polish
version
of
a
eurolager
and
instead
i
was
amazed
to
be
treated
to
one
of
the
best
oktoberfests
ive
ever
had
and
thats
saying
a
lot
since
ive
had
quite
a
few
and
its
one
of
my
favorite
styles
an
outstanding
ofest
from
poland
who
wouldve
thunk
11
2oz
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
dark
golden
orange
color
with
a
thin
fizzy
white
head
that
quickly
disappears
the
aroma
is
dominated
by
slightly
toasted
malts
some
caramel
and
a
hint
of
toffee
the
taste
much
like
the
aroma
is
mostly
malt
with
some
caramel
and
a
barely
noticeable
hop
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
thin
and
undercarbonated
for
my
liking
overall
i
will
likely
pass
on
purchasing
this
beer
again
it
tastes
like
a
light
nutbrown
ale
it
has
decent
quality
but
it
really
doesnt
do
anything
special
when
you
finish
it
its
like
ok
that
was
good
whats
next
sweetness
may
be
bothersome
to
some
drinkers
its
almost
sickly
sweet
i
was
expecting
a
standard
eurolager
when
purchasing
this
brew
but
i
knew
my
polish
friends
would
not
steer
me
wrong
i
would
eventually
like
to
try
the
strong
variation
of
this
beer
but
i
may
have
to
make
a
trip
to
poland
in
order
to
do
that
which
is
fine
with
me
an
easy
drinking
beer
and
a
good
one
to
relax
with
rich
mouth
feel
medium
body
on
this
lasger
drinkable
and
satisfying
one
pf
the
best
polish
lagers
on
par
with
okocim
poured
nice
into
the
glass
with
a
nice
white
head
the
color
was
a
amber
color
with
the
smell
being
sweet
the
mouthfeel
was
not
clean
but
that
of
a
light
syrup
texture
the
alcohol
content
was
7
percent
but
the
alcohol
wasnt
present
in
the
taste
the
beer
was
lacking
character
along
with
taste
overall
i
was
disappointed
surprisingly
good
drinkability
from
a
beer
from
an
iffy
country
nearly
in
the
same
class
as
the
best
of
the
style
from
germany
this
is
a
beer
i
can
recommend
drinkability
was
ok
i
could
have
another
if
i
wanted
to
but
i
wouldnt
be
terribly
drawn
to
it
unless
the
only
other
thing
available
was
macroswill
taste
is
pretty
sweet
very
malty
malt
is
quite
present
woth
shy
hoppy
flavours
which
rounds
up
a
floral
bouquet
very
watery
and
smooth
there
was
some
presense
ethyl
in
the
end
warka
beer
pours
a
dark
amber
the
smell
is
decent
no
unpleasant
notes
mostly
malt
and
maybe
just
a
touch
of
hops
the
taste
is
dominated
by
malt
not
much
hops
nothing
special
but
not
bad
either
definitely
drinkable
im
not
sure
id
pick
one
up
again
but
i
could
see
someone
else
liking
it
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
a
1

offwhite
head
above
the
clear
light
golden
brew
frothy
head
lasts
and
lasts
with
lots
of
lacing
aroma
is
light
relatively
balanced
with
spicy
hops
tipping
the
scales
a
bit
taste
is
sweet
pale
grains
with
a
crisp
saazish
hoppiness
mouthfeel
is
reasonably
smooth
and
drinkability
is
nice
as
well
not
bad
esp
for
the
travelling
this
can
has
done
beautiful
gold
hue
almost
no

sweet
malty
has
a
good
taste
sweet
malty
with
a
nice
roast
at
the
end
tastes
very
much
to
the
oktoberfest
style
mouthfeel
is
good
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
this
is
a
great
beer
very
drinkable
and
perfect
with
a
nice
dessert
dark
gold
in
color
with
a
white
head
that
fizzes
itself
out
quickly
malty
aroma
with
caamel
vanilla
and
a
light
fruitiness
honey
aromas
make
a
showing
as
it
warms
slight
astringency
and
hints
of
an
almost
maple
syrup
aroma
also
show
up
very
sweet
with
candy
like
flavors
that
mirror
the
aroma
minus
the
astringency
apple
like
fruitiness
combines
with
the
caramel
to
create
a
very
pleasing
caramel
apple
taste
obviously
lighter
medium
body
with
average
carbonation
good
drinkability
while
very
sweet
it
is
not
overwhelming
at
all
worth
a
try
if
you
can
get
your
hands
on
it
i
gotta
admit
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
with
my
first
polish
beer
this
is
a
very
good
euro
lager
definitely
the
best
polish
beer
ive
tried
yet
id
get
this
again
this
beer
has
a
couple
of
nice
touches
but
is
just
too
sweet
to
be
really
enjoyable
not
enough
balance
too
watery
malty
nose
smells
somewhat
like
a
golden
graham
cereal
almost
tastes
like
a
graham
cracker
sort
of
a
lightly
sweet
syrupy
and
grainy
flavor
the
deep
straw
gold
color
with
a
steady
stream
of
carbonation
throughout
begs
to
say
drink
me
not
quite
enough
hops
for
me
but
has
the
sticky
sweet
finish
and
nice
mouthfeel
most
real
beer
drinkers
talk
about
perfectly
drinkable
and
surprisingly
to
me
a
dangerously
enjoyable
beer
i
dont
know
if
i
would
classify
this
beer
as
a
marzenoctoberfest
it
is
clearly
a
pilsner
pours
out
to
a
bright
yellow
in
the
glass
with
a
very
active
carbonation
and
a
nice
fluffly
white
head
the
aroma
is
that
of
hayfreshly
cut
grass
the
taste
is
superb
for
a
fizzy
yellow
beer
there
are
hints
of
caramel
and
honey
with
a
nice
little
hop
bite
on
the
finish
incredibly
drinkable
i
dont
think
ive
rated
a
pils
this
high
before
apples
and
caramel
in
the
start
of
the
taste
there
is
a
solid
grainy
kick
just
before
the
aftertaste
which
is
dry
and
bready
if
it
werent
for
the
apple
taste
overpowering
the
grains
this
one
would
be
a
much
better
brew
than
it
is
it
is
easy
to
drink
and
the
carbonation
is
at
the
right
level
its
been
awhile
since
ive
had
beer
from
a
can
and
i
wasnt
expecting
much
but
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
the
crystal
clear
straw
yellow
color
was
covered
by
a
fluffy
white
head
that
faded
slowly
leaving
a
thin
white
film
on
top
a
faint
odor
of
cardboard
is
there
but
very
little
aroma
overall
this
brew
is
lacking
in
the
taste
department
i
would
say
its
like
a
thin
vienna
lager
at
best
by
not
being
over
carbonated
i
could
drink
many
of
these
with
a
couple
kelly
dogs
on
a
hot
summer
day
beer
pours
a
quite
deep
gold
to
almost
copper
color
with
a
pertinent
white
head
that
is
frothy
in
texture
and
the
lace
a
nice
thick
sheet
to
seal
the
glass
nose
is
dominated
by
malt
somewhat
crisp
and
fresh
a
bit
musty
and
the
start
a
bit
too
sweet
the
top
thin
finish
is
strong
in
its
carbonation
with
the
hops
adequate
and
the
aftertaste
dry
and
lingering
drinkable
but
not
something
that
lit
my
beer
fire
a
dark
offering
almost
amber
in
colour
with
a
taste
of
fruitiness
and
almonds
and
a
little
thin
this
is
a
full
bodied
brew
with
a
minor
lace
as
its
crowning
glory
or
lack
of
does
nothing
for
me
but
i
am
glad
i
met
it
can
version
poured
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
thick
beige
head
malt
and
caramel
aroma
sweet
malt
flavor
but
kind
of
thin
for
a
vienna
granted
gls
eliot
ness
has
ruined
me
as
far
as
other
viennas
go
it
is
nice
to
know
that
people
had
a
beer
this
good
500
years
ago
warka
beer
from
poland
in
a
half
liter
can
deep
amber
color
with
a
thick
rocky
white
head
they
claim
that
this
beer
has
been
around
since
before
columbus
sailed
i
was
fully
expecting
a
skunked
out
eurolager
but
instead
found
a
slightly
thin
vienna
style
lager
very
very
sweet
with
dominant
malt
tastes
almost
honey
like
a
simple
hop
presence
at
the
end
does
what
it
can
to
balance
out
the
sweetness
nevertheless
this
was
a
surprisingly
good
beer
particularly
for
1
29
a
can
tasted
pretty
good
after
the
quarter
marathon
delicious
beer
understated
and
balanced
perfectly
wish
i
had
more
highly
recommended
great
and
very
smooth
beer
on
the
lighter
side
but
with
a
good
body
with
it
too
the
smell
and
aromas
have
been
average
but
the
taste
is
phenomenal
taste
crisp
smooth
moderate
sized
body
herbal
assertive
bitterness
grainy
dried
hay
slightly
biscuity
earthy
orange
zest
drying
hoppy
finish
i
like
this
beer
its
great
i
have
had
lots
and
lots
of
different
beers
wines
and
distilled
spirits
in
my
travels
and
having
lived
in
various
countries
around
the
world
this
is
a
beer
like
the
lagerpilsen
types
that
ive
enjoyed
in
the
czech
republic
belgium
austria
switzerland
germany
and
hungary
the
micro
brew
movement
in
the
u
s
is
turning
out
some
really
world
class
brews
cheers
mates
and
keep
up
the
bleedin
great
work
overall
nothing
too
complex
here
just
a
solid
lager
with
a
decent
hop
bitterness
reminds
me
a
lot
of
carlsberg
or
other
european
lagers
without
the
skunkiness
overall
this
is
a
drinkable
lager
but
not
exceptional
a
good
example
to
be
sure
but
not
my
favorite
either
i
recommend
trying
it
and
seeing
if
it
is
to
your
liking
great
prices
though
here
in
houston
6
a
sixer
hmm
nice
funky
nose
slightly
sweet
taste
brilliant
golden
yellow
colour
slightly
crisp
hop
bite
in
the
after
taste
very
nicely
done
indeed
aside
from
the
fact
that
i
am
thrilled
beers
like
this
are
finally
being
brewed
in
texas
on
a
larger
scale
this
is
just
a
damn
fine
beer
not
fancy
but
clean
and
refreshing
and
very
very
drinkable
i
dont
brew
myself
but
ive
always
heard
that
lagers
are
harder
to
brew
with
consistency
karbach
has
obviously
figured
things
out
i
really
like
this
beer
cheers
overall
judging
based
on
the
epls
ive
had
in
europe
in
the
past
this
is
far
too
full
bodied
sweet
and
sticky
for
my
tastes
if
im
going
to
drink
an
epl
while
traveling
or
mowing
the
lawn
id
want
something
with
lighter
body
and
crisper
more
refreshing
mouthfeel
i
did
a
quick
review
on
this
gem
awhile
back
got
a
bad
habit
of
being
lazy
and
not
doing
write
ups
for
some
reason
i
have
passed
this
beer
up
for
the
last
4
months
since
i
first
seen
it
sitting
along
side
its
counterpart
brews
from
karbach
this
is
one
of
the
finest
lagers
available
i
picked
up
a
sixer
at
heb
i
like
cans
they
are
the
next
thing
in
craft
beer
stays
fresh
and
gets
cold
fast
this
beer
taste
like
a
lager
should
clean
crisp
and
refreshing
with
a
nice
balance
good
lacing
if
poured
the
can
taste
great
as
is
maybe
a
good
bbq
beer
beach
beer
you
decide
dont
be
afraid
to
try
this
one
im
happy
with
it
support
texas
breweries
highly
recommended
im
getting
more
impressed
with
karbachs
beers
each
time
i
try
a
new
one
low
c
rjt
o
not
bad
something
different
but
the
color
wasnt
what
i
was
expecting
but
that
might
have
been
my
fault
even
though
it
might
be
a
bit
off
the
mark
i
like
it
better
than
some
other
euro
pale
lagers
pours
a
pale
light
coppery
color
thick
fluffy
white
head
and
loads
of
lace
aroma
was
mild
but
theres
crackers
and
biscuits
light
sweetness
and
a
touch
of
crassly
hops
taste
is
much
better
sweet
bready
notes
biscuits
tinge
of
caramel
sweetness
grassy
floral
hop
notes
with
the
slightest
of
bitterness
light
bodied
good
crisp
carbonation
and
a
refreshing
lager
great
lawn
owner
beer
karbach
is
doing
things
i
saw
it
on
tap
all
over
houston
this
past
weekend
a
clean
goldenorange
pour
with
2
fingers
of
detergentlike
head
smells
of
orange
lemongrass
lager
yeast
bread
slightly
hoppy
bitterness
up
front
then
it
goes
staight
to
the
sweet
malty
typical
lager
flavor
finished
off
by
more
earthy
bittering
notes
one
of
the
hoppiest
lagers
ive
had
the
name
suits
it
well
mediumlight
body
with
modest
amount
of
carbonation
sticky
on
the
lips
a
great
lager
not
one
of
the
best
offerings
from
the
brewer
but
hey
this
is
a
great
gateway
beer
if
you
ask
me
a
cut
above
most
standard
lagers
flavor
profile
is
butter
and
biscuit
malts
some
bittering
hops
but
mainly
bready
type
malts
i
couldnt
drink
a
lot
of
this
it
was
just
a
really
bad
lager
i
like
the
other
stuff
they
make
but
this
i
couldnt
handle
o
a
beer
that
attempts
to
restore
the
good
name
of
lagers
im
not
typically
a
huge
lager
fan
but
this
is
pretty
good
houston
cut
me
off
into
space
im
not
coming
back
ill
say
hi
to
voyager
for
you
very
foamy
mid
yellow
bodied
lager
nothing
interesting
in
aroma
department
mid
mouth
feel
decent
drinkability
despite
slight
acidic
edge
in
finish
always
giving
a
lager
an
even
break
decent
malting
not
sweet
some
spiciness
not
bad
and
vienna
is
a
style
i
can
like
another
of
a
seemingly
endless
supply
of
canned
beers
from
woodychandler
poured
from
a
12
oz
can
has
a
light
brownish
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
sweet
and
malty
taste
is
malts
grains
some
hops
at
the
finish
sweetness
from
the
smell
is
missing
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
pretty
good
beer
o
this
was
quite
a
surprise
i
had
asked
for
it
because
ive
been
looking
for
a
good
lager
and
was
not
dissapointed
this
is
a
tasty
beer
with
a
degree
of
complexity
i
was
not
initially
expecting
kudos
to
karbach
youre
doing
the
style
and
state
of
texas
proud
from
karbach
street
to
chez
woody
i
began
with
a
standard
crack
followed
by
an
inverted
glug
resulting
in
cascading
action
at
the
juncture
between
liquid
and
foam
color
was
a
deep
amber
with
nequality
clarity
the
tawny
head
was
massive
and
lasting
and
resembled
the
top
of
an
ice
cream
cone
nose
was
pleasantly
malty
and
sweet
and
i
am
ok
with
that
especially
in
a
lager
following
so
many
aal
clunkers
on
the
canquest
tm
to
date
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
the
grassy
saaz
hops
were
immediately
obvious
on
the
tongue
finish
was
dry
and
moderately
bitter
and
i
can
get
behind
this
i
would
take
this
to
the
beach
or
put
it
in
my
cooler
for
hula
in
the
coola
day
01
february
annually
houston
i
have
no
problem
with
this
beer
bravo
to
all
involved
drink
one
of
the
better
lagers
still
cant
get
into
the
style
a
fine
tasty
lager
very
easy
drinking
with
noticeable
yet
wellbalanced
lager
flavorings
throughout
this
is
actually
quite
pretty
for
a
lager
overall
a
very
solid
all
malt
lager
perhaps
a
bit
sharp
and
somewhat
pilsnerlike
good
amount
of
taste
goes
amazingly
well
with
soft
pretzels
and
good
mustard
smooth
graininess
with
a
pretty
big
punch
of
hoppy
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
surprisingly
full
and
rich
for
this
type
of
lager
id
actually
place
it
more
in
the
american
pale
lager
category
or
maybe
a
helles
as
opposed
to
an
amberred
lager
there
is
nothing
amber
or
red
about
it
whatever
you
call
it
it
is
damn
tasty
ill
be
buying
this
one
again
for
sure
overall
the
hubby
and
i
like
it
and
appreciate
it
for
how
big
it
is
for
the
style
a
full
flavored
complex
lager
worth
trying
karbach
brewing
co
continues
to
impress
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
flavors
are
very
floral
yeast
light
hoppyness
amber
wheat
bockiness
is
strong
definitely
a
lager
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
but
this
is
pretty
drinkable
aromas
and
flavors
dont
appear
to
match
however
oone
of
the
most
flavorful
lagers
ive
had
yet
well
done
very
enjoyable
and
a
nice
addition
to
the
houston
beer
scene
i
will
continue
to
drink
this
again
but
i
think
there
are
better
lagers
made
in
texas
karbach
blew
me
away
with
their
first
release
not
so
much
with
the
others
still
very
enjoyable
and
worth
a
try
palate
is
rich
smooth
and
crisp
yet
pours
a
goldenyellow
in
color
with
a
thin
white
head
that
settles
down
mostly
along
the
sides
some
spotty
lacing
is
seen
when
sipped
lots
going
on
with
the
aroma
as
there
is
grass
yeast
honey
herbal
and
some
honey
pretty
much
the
taste
follows
the
nose
with
some
malts
and
hops
in
the
mix
as
well
a
slight
bitter
finish
is
noted
but
doesnt
linger
mediumbodied
and
higher
carbonation
as
there
is
a
lot
of
streaming
bubbles
rising
from
the
bottom
and
sides
of
the
glass

it
wasnt

superior
to

standard

light

nice
pilsy
taste
but
more
body
than
the
adjunct
version
flavor
nice
combination
that
mirrors
the
aroma
toasted
white
bread
some
grassy
flavors
and
some
mild
lingering
hop
bitterness
wait
brewed
and
canned
in
ontario
canada
wtf
darned
canadians
overall
a
bit
rough
around
the
edges
the
flavor
seemed
to
change
from
the
first
sip
to
the
last
didnt
really
care
for
the
inconsistency
the
biggest
issue
in
my
opinion
is
that
it
is
very
flat
tasting
there
was
no
head
after
pouring
this
beer
and
i
see
no
signs
of
carbonation
within
the
glass
this
leaves
something
desired
on
the
palate
when
drinking
o
not
good
not
bad
and
does
remind
me
of
a
junior
version
of
say
grolsch
pours
a
clear
golden
orange
with
a
foamy
offwhite
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
grain
and
some
grassy
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
sweet
grain
and
grassy
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
very
mild
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
low
level
of
carbonation
with
an
almost
flat
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
an
average
beer
with
a
definite
malt
and
hop
presence
but
its
pretty
bland
and
gets
much
less
drinkable
as
it
warms
up
in
my
opinion
o
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
and
seems
a
little
bland
but
doesnt
have
any
offensive
aromas
or
flavors
overall
i
like
this
beer
for
a
macro
lager
it
is
surprisingly
clean
and
tasty
as
well
as
eminently
drinkable
a
nice
clear
slightly
darker
than
average
lager
color
with
a
bright
white
head
that
stays
for
a
bit
little
bit
of
lacing
smell
is
sweet
grain
but
its
a
bit
deeper
than
expected
slightly
floral
earthy
hops
balance
out
the
nose
taste
is
very
balanced
and
impressive
clean
sweet
grain
dominates
the
palate
and
finishes
dry
with
a
slight
earthy
hop
bitterness
carbonation
and
mouthfeel
are
appropriate
and
enjoyable
good
stuff
for
the
style
and
id
have
one
whenever
an
easydrinker
is
needed
especially
against
regular
sapporo
and
other
rice
lagers
session
beers
dont
get
much
better
than
this
when
it
comes
to
lagers
and
unlike
pabst
this
didnt
have
any
potato
chiplike
starch
in
the
mouthfeel
while
this
didnt
blow
me
away
id
have
another
of
these
over
massmarket
examples
of
this
style
and
would
love
to
try
it
with
some
japanese
fare
the
world
needs
more
beers
like
this
that
are
light
in
hue
but
filling
enough
in
taste
and
body
as
a
reminder
that
not
all
lagers
need
to
feel
smelly
and
watereddown
sapporo
reserve
pours
an
orange
color
with
an
off
white
head
from
a
gold
and
silver
twenty
two
ounce
can
the
aroma
is
mild
spicy
hops
dominate
the
flavor
is
quite
nice
spicy
hops
well
balanced
with
malt
this
is
a
very
light
bodied
beer
but
is
leagues
better
than
most
macro
lagers
easy
to
drink
and
tasty
im
giving
this
beer
average
marks
because
i
dont
think
its
intended
to
be
a
something
that
you
just
kick
back
with
and
down
a
few
it
is
similar
to
standard
macro
lagers
but
with
the
offensive
elements
noticeably
missing
id
drink
this
over
most
macros
any
day
but
it
would
never
be
my
first
choice
overall
solid
lager
from
sapporo
a
bit
sweeter
and
more
complex
than
their
original
draft
offering
the
difference
in
quality
ingredients
is
obvious
usual
medium
light
body
with
a
not
to
zesty
level
of
carbonation
this
is
quite
drinkable
i
like
overall
this
is
pretty
much
a
failure
all
around
it
lacks
direction
and
purpose
its
not
good
alone
and
i
have
to
imagine
it
would
be
a
disaster
with
almost
any
kind
of
food
i
would
not
purchase
this
again
this
is
the
beer
i
reach
for
when
i
want
a
regular
beer
perfect
size
3
for
22
oz
and
doesnt
overwhelm
the
senses
just
a
great
regular
beer
first
class
nice
beer
that
goes
down
very
easy
fairly
bland
but
was
still
enjoyable
compliments
japanese
cuisine
very
well
quite
good
for
the
style
not
a
shabby
euro
pale
lager
could
use
a
bit
more
hops
but
the
malt
claim
is
justified
and
i
had
no
problem
putting
back
the
can
after
the
warmth
of
this
day
sassy
contoured
can
too
jeez
can
environment
have
that
much
affect
on
a
guys
beer
senses
apparently
so
its
not
bad
its
like
a
typical
party
where
you
know
what
is
going
to
happen
and
at
the
end
of
the
night
you
are
happy
but
there
were
no
surprises
that
left
you
ecstatic
overall
it
is
a
3
5
rjt
m
light
bodied
with
good
carbonation
overall
eh
this
is
a
small
step
above
bud
i
was
really
hoping
for
a
nice
big
step
from
a
name
like
this
with
its
pushing
of
its
euro
hop
and
all
malt
bill
but
its
fallen
short
absolutely
nothing
special
but
a
wellmade
lager
seems
like
more
mouthfeel
than
most
and
the
gold
and
silver
can
always
makes
me
feel
like
ive
drinking
something
rare
and
expensive
o
this
is
great
by
far
the
best
japanese
beer
ive
ever
had
this
is
a
pale
yellow
brew
with
decent
head
clean
crisp
taste
no
aftertaste
lingering
to
spoil
your
sashimi
this
is
the
best
from
japan
ive
tried
so
far
the
sixth
entry
in
swillfest
2011
it
pours
a
clear
pale
yellow
straw
topped
by
a
finger
of
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
rice
wheat
and
soap
and
thats
it
the
taste
has
nothing
constructive
to
add
to
this
discussion
unless
you
consider
a
few
bits
of
minerals
constructive
which
clearly
i
dont
the
body
is
pretty
light
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
a
watery
feel
and
a
kinda
crisp
dry
finish
overall
a
light
airy
beer
that
doesnt
seem
to
have
much
else
to
offer
but
its
lightness
this
beer
pours
a
pale
golden
color
the
smell
is
puffed
rice
almost
exclusively
the
flavor
is
upsettingly
rice
filled
its
sticky
sweet
rice
overall
i
really
really
dont
find
this
to
be
preferential
unadviseable
if
you
truly
like
beer
drinkabilityoverall
i
have
to
say
overall
this
beer
was
better
then
what
i
expect
having
never
really
tried
it
before
its
a
solid
lager
with
nice
balance
that
would
go
very
well
with
many
foods
and
still
have
enough
flavor
to
be
decent
on
its
own
i
got
this
can
at
a
st
louis
store
next
to
some
other
interesting
imports
it
was
not
bad
smell
was
just
ok
taste
was
malty
but
has
a
watery
taste
in
their
somewhere
exposing
its
cheapness
overall
i
liked
it
for
a
good
cheap
drink
with
friends
but
its
nothing
special
the
price
was
the
point
and
this
beer
is
right
with
other
adjunct
beers
pours
a
very
clear
and
pale
yellow
color
barley
malt
is
very
evident
in
its
scent
hinting
that
this
might
have
a
cheap
beer
taste
the
taste
is
mild
and
rather
malty
rather
simple
and
nothing
all
that
special
considering
its
from
japan
something
new
to
try
from
a
different
country
but
considering
its
taste
you
could
go
with
pabst
blue
ribbon
and
not
be
missing
much
this
beer
pours
dark
honey
golden
in
color
with
half
an
inch
of
pure
white
foamy
head
that
leaves
light
to
medium
lacing
down
the
glass
the
aroma
is
clean
grain
a
bit
of
straw
some
zesty
hoppiness
and
a
slight
metallic
tone
the
taste
is
a
wave
of
grainy
malt
followed
by
a
bitter
hoppiness
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
but
finishes
wellcarbonated
to
the
point
of
stinging
the
tongue
this
beer
is
a
simple
basic
lager
that
would
best
be
had
with
some
salty
tart
or
spicy
food
notes
its
a
good
clean
lager
and
an
uplifting
palate
cleanser
opposite
my
pineapple
fried
rice
d
not
my
favorite
style
but
i
think
this
is
a
good
interpretation
of
it
clean
crisp
without
a
lot
of
the
typical
bad
flavors
associated
with
the
style
it
tastes
well
made
even
if
it
is
not
my
cup
of
tea
drinkability
nothing
special
dinkable
but
not
impressive
slightly
hazed
pale
yellow
colored
body
with
a
bright
white
thicket
of
head
dwindles
slowly
even
chunky
specks
of
lacing
aroma
has
nice
cereal
notes
pale
malts
all
grain
served
from
a
22
ounce
can
this
thing
is
bad
ass
and
sturdy
much
like
the
sapporo
premium
can
but
this
one
has
all
malt
beer
written
on
it
nice
full
on
malt
profile
light
biscuithints
of
cracker
with
herbal
grassy
finishing
hops
much
better
than
the
average
japanese
lager
carbonation
is
sturdy
body
is
light
but
not
thin
im
liking
this
stuff
overall
drinkability
is
solid
a
beer
that
would
go
well
with
a
specialty
sushi
roll
or
by
itself
affordable
on
3
bucks
a
can
definitely
worth
it
for
a
22
ounce
portion
drinkability
a
pretty
typical
import
aiming
at
the
mainstream
u
s
market
i
got
this
to
accompany
some
sushi
but
it
did
not
compliment
it
particularly
well
i
was
hoping
this
would
be
an
amped
up
rice
lager
but
its
closer
to
an
adjunct
lager
id
take
kirin
or
asahi
over
this
any
day
the
beer
pours
a
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
grain
oranges
lemons
and
some
metal
the
majority
of
the
aroma
is
taken
up
by
the
grain
but
the
citrus
hides
in
the
back
and
occasionally
makes
an
appearance
the
flavor
is
a
mix
of
grassy
hops
bready
malt
and
grain
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
nothing
exciting
about
the
beer
but
it
is
not
bad
d
i
was
quite
impressed
with
this
beer
a
definite
step
up
from
the
typical
import
rice
lagers
pours
a
typical
clear
golden
yellow
with
a
decent
white
head
aroma
is
quite
strong
and
malty
not
complex
but
still
inviting
flavor
is
strong
and
malty
enjoyable
if
not
complex
this
is
a
good
accompaniment
to
a
meal
rather
than
a
stand
alone
beer
texture
is
quite
tingly
and
fizzy
crystal
clear
gold
colour
with
a
thin
layer
of
fine
white
bubbles
lacing
was
sticky
and
spotty
decent
head
retention
soft
malt
aroma
a
bit
of
hop
spice
delicate
fruity
esters
low
bitterness
nice
malty
backbone
with
lingering
hops
floral
and
spicy
medium
bodied
off
dry
moderate
and
slightly
crisp
carbonation
this
is
pretty
solid
and
quite
drinkable
im
actually
impressed
with
the
recent
sapporo
beers
that
ive
had
maybe
im
getting
them
fresher
now
i
guess
guelph
isnt
too
far
away
notes
im
very
impressed
with
this
beer
it
has
good
flavors
and
is
very
smooth
overall
this
beer
is
shit
dont
buy
it
the
beer
is
telling
you
its
all
barley
malt
and
clearly
its
not
all
barley
its
adjunct
crap
this
was
ok
not
bad
but
i
wont
pick
it
again
this
is
good
for
the
style
and
a
completely
capable
brew
i
wouldnt
mind
being
confined
to
this
for
a
night
could
be
heaps
worse
again
very
little
hop
flavour
here
but
it
is
there
slightly
spicy
and
reminiscent
of
noble
variety
hops
a
real
grainy
texture
with
clean
malts
the
beer
is
just
a
little
sweet
but
mostly
very
crisp
and
very
dry
its
a
lot
better
than
i
thought
it
would
be
judging
by
scent
alone
prickly
carbonation
is
a
little
rough
but
overall
a
decently
drinkable
beer
well
done
land
of
the
rising
sun
d
this
is
very
solid
stuff
from
sapporo
one
of
the
best
beers
to
be
had
in
the
euro
lager
category
drinkability
excellent
a
decent
session
beer
for
a
malt
liquor
d
i
could
drink
this
all
night
very
easy
to
drink
pleasant
tasting
and
not
overly
carbonated
i
think
this
is
my
favorite
japanese
brew
so
far
even
if
it
is
brewed
in
canada
tricky
import
advertising
taste
is
slightly
sweetmalted
with
an
equally
coppery
taste
no
big
surprises
very
mild
but
well
balanced
hoppy
finish
medium
bodied
medium
carbonated
medium
medium
average
d
not
a
bad
beer
a
few
small
tweaks
here
and
there
could
be
made
but
its
fairly
wellbalanced
and
pretty
drinkable
it
wont
be
poured
out
ill
put
it
that
way
sweet
silver
and
gold
can
pours
a
clear
gold
color
with
a
big
fluff
head
tiny
bubbles
and
good
sticky
webs
of
lace
smells
pretty
clean
alittle
sweet
with
some
grainy
aromas
tastes
decently
crisp
and
clean
almost
detect
hops
slightly
sweet
and
bitter
id
say
it
feels
fairly
light
and
is
very
drinkable
provided
it
doesnt
warm
up
definitely
better
than
sapporo
premium
and
i
wouldnt
mind
this
again
one
thing
i
noticed
though
is
this
is
brewed
in
canada
which
upsets
me
alittle
as
i
thought
this
was
from
japan
d
well
i
guess
i
can
say
ive
finally
tried
it
but
its
nothing
to
write
home
to
the
mainland
about
cheers
a
nice
light
lager
though
will
likely
not
pursue
this
beer
d
seems
like
a
solid
session
beer
not
amazing
but
definitely
a
decent
beer
overall
poured
from
a
22
oz
can
has
a
golden
color
with
a
1
inch
head
smells
of
malts
and
grains
tastes
of
barley
and
malts
not
overly
flavorful
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
has
decent
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
fairly
good
beer
but
nothing
spectacular
the
taste
is
a
decent
somewhat
fullbodied
basic
pale
lager
with
light
grain
character
a
little
apple
and
light
vague
hops
generally
grassy
and
somewhat
spicey
with
faint
hints
of
lemon
it
has
light
sweetness
before
a
light
spicey
faintly
grassy
bitterness
takes
over
by
the
finish
and
dominates
it
with
a
light
lingering
aftertaste
of
spicey
lightly
grassy
bitterness
and
faint
sweet
cracker
the
elements
dont
mesh
fairly
well
and
they
seem
to
clash
a
bit
especially
the
bitterness
which
tends
to
stand
out
all
by
itself
when
drunk
without
any
food
its
fairly
enjoyable
and
the
bitterness
and
what
character
it
has
hold
up
well
with
certain
foods
but
its
really
rather
bland
and
thin
with
a
slightly
rough
feel
i
would
have
no
problem
drinking
this
again
but
have
no
desire
to
drink
it
alone
or
seek
it
out
thinking
of
it
like
this
while
in
vegas
i
asked
one
of
the
waitresses
by
the
pool
what
beers
they
had
they
fired
the
usually
array
of
lagers
bud
bud
light
miller
lite
heineken
sapporo
reserve
and
corona
being
a
beer
nerd
there
was
only
one
choice
drinkability
is
good
for
a
pale
lager
this
is
fresh
enough
but
leaves
a
bit
to
be
desired
the
profile
is
a
bit
bland
but
ends
up
pleasant
on
the
palate
this
could
easily
get
stale
which
the
can
obviously
protects
but
the
lager
yeast
character
sustains
the
pale
malts
and
lightly
sweet
profile
cheers
drinks
okay
this
would
be
alright
some
sashimi
otherwise
pass
taste
is
grainy
and
biscuity
a
touch
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
finish
and
even
some
hop
flavor
give
it
a
nearly
pilsnerlike
feel
it
is
smooth
going
down
the
hatch
and
feels
a
bit
creamy
its
pretty
easy
to
drink
really
one
of
the
better
asian
lagers
i
have
had
but
still
pretty
run
of
the
mill
dan
ok
drinker
but
i
like
the
can
better
than
the
beer
notes
i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
will
look
upon
it
for
future
purchase
i
like
this
one
better
than
most
japanese
lagers
it
compliments
japanese
cuisine
pretty
well
it
is
crisp
but
not
quite
refreshing
not
much
of
a
finish
but
it
is
drinkable
sapporo
reserve
is
a
maltier
version
of
sapporo
nice
and
light
and
crisp
but
the
extra
malts
add
flavor
nice
head
from
the
pour
but
not
much
smell
at
all
medium
carbonation
and
average
color
overall
this
just
an
average
beer
but
it
tastes
better
than
a
regular
sapporo
it
was
the
best
option
at
a
sushi
place
and
i
would
drink
it
again
poured
a
super
clear
golden
straw
color
with
a
surprisingly
frothy
white
head
that
stuck
around
for
quite
awhile
awesome
lacing
there
isnt
much
to
the
aroma
clean
and
malty
tastes
like
a
euro
lager
but
with
some
tasty
but
low
key
hop
flavor
this
is
one
super
clean
and
crisp
brew
the
malt
is
fairly
sweet
the
carbonation
is
sharp
to
the
tounge
the
feel
is
medium
but
slightly
drying
very
refreshing
beer
if
the
sushi
joint
has
this
and
the
regular
sapporo
by
all
means
get
this
i
mean
its
nothing
outta
this
word
but
its
solid
and
sushi
joints
usually
have
piss
like
tiger
beer
or
kirin
ichiban
atmosphere
is
ok
appearance
is
decent
but
nose
although
outstanding
is
a
little
unusual
flavor
is
alot
like
the
nose
not
bad
but
takes
a
little
getting
used
to
feel
is
serviceable
but
you
have
to
get
past
the
aftertaste
some
may
enjoy
the
distinctiveness
but
not
my
favorite
style
however
when
its
all
said
and
done
its
a
serviceable
quaff
much
preferred
over
many
other
japanese
lagers
the
smell
and
appearance
were
about
average
being
similar
to
the
regular
sapporo
the
taste
was
slightly
below
average
with
a
noticeable
imbalance
in
its
blend
of
maltiness
and
crisp
lightness
the
same
imbalance
led
to
its
distinct
mouthfeel
for
lack
of
a
better
word
the
drinkability
however
was
atrocious
i
had
to
give
it
to
my
roommate
to
finish
as
i
could
literally
not
finish
more
than
a
quarter
of
the
hardcore
can
this
was
definitely
the
best
of
a
recent
tour
of
asian
beers
i
took
all
without
leaving
wisconsin
but
that
is
still
not
saying
all
that
much
this
beer
pours
a
darker
color
than
regular
sapporo
which
is
something
that
you
might
expect
from
a
beer
called
reserve
this
beer
offers
some
up
nice
maltiness
which
came
to
me
as
a
baking
bread
aroma
and
flavor
more
than
i
expected
but
hardly
terric
drinkability
is
moderate
its
not
an
offensive
beer
but
maybe
just
not
my
style
really
definitely
give
it
a
shot
trying
to
review
this
beer
for
what
it
is
a
macro
in
a
can
i
know
its
great
with
sushi
and
spicy
food
sapporo
reserve
has
its
place
in
the
beer
pantheon
you
can
drink
a
ton
of
this
huge
three
finger
head
of
eggshell
white
foam
brimmed
the
top
of
my
glass
after
i
aggressively
poured
the
can
in
slowly
the
head
faded
back
to
a
thin
layer
of
medium
to
small
sized
bubbles
the
brew
itself
is
sunflower
yellow
the
same
yellow
as
the
bottom
of
the
reserve
can
good
marketing
and
crystal
clear
with
some
visible
carbonation
aroma
is
dominated
by
yeast
though
i
do
detect
a
metallic
undertone
flavors
are
distinctly
better
than
regular
sapporo
definitely
an
evolved
version
of
the
same
beer
slightly
sweet
hints
of
malt
first
touch
my
taste
buds
followed
by
the
grainy
yeast
and
barely
then
the
cutting
hops
the
finish
is
the
same
distinctly
metallic
flavor
noted
in
the
aroma
and
it
really
takes
a
lot
away
from
the
beer
a
shame
really
because
i
would
not
have
another
for
this
reason
nor
can
i
recommend
it
as
a
good
example
of
the
style
bought
one
on
a
business
trip
to
enjoy
in
the
hotel
room
with
my
texmex
from
chilis
not
a
bad
option
but
it
wasnt
quite
as
good
as
i
thought
it
might
be
bright
yellow
in
the
hotel
glass
with
a
decent
pale
heada
lot
of
head
at
first
but
it
didnt
last
long
malt
in
the
nose
with
a
subtle
if
present
at
all
hops
bitterness
the
grain
was
immediately
evident
in
the
taste
but
so
was
a
strange
metallic
aftertaste
that
just
left
me
wondering
why
wasnt
as
good
as
i
had
hoped
d
i
enjoyed
this
one
quite
a
bit
a
very
tasty
lager
that
pairs
very
well
with
sushi
head
and
shoulders
above
sapporos
rice
lagers
very
cool
looking
can
which
is
probably
an
enticement
in
itself
poors
a
deep
golden
color
with
superb
clarity
and
a
rocky
head
malty
aroma
subtle
taste
is
malty
with
a
slight
hoppiness
present
a
little
on
the
sweeter
side
which
affects
the
crispness
a
bit
a
little
less
sweetness
would
benefit
this
brew
but
its
a
decent
brew
nonetheless
not
something
i
would
drink
on
a
regular
basis
i
had
a
czechvar
prior
to
this
beer
and
i
preferred
the
czechvar
over
this
one
d
average
drinkability
one
would
be
plenty
at
a
time
it
definitely
deserves
a
little
more
respect
than
some
of
the
reviews
i
see
posted
here
this
beer
offers
a
noticeable
improvement
compared
to
sapporo
premium
beer
its
all
malt
goodness
and
no
frills
approach
make
it
a
good
beer
for
everyday
consumption
dcant
get
over
the
metalmouth
sensation
it
takes
me
back
to
my
juniorhigh
years
in
braces
and
i
dont
miss
those
days
im
glad
i
dont
drop
5
for
these
when
i
eat
out
asian
food
beer
nothing
more
nor
less
did
pour
with
a
big
foamy
frothy
head
and
a
bit
of
lace
golden
amber
color
nose
was
beery
oddly
mouthfilling
but
still
watery
hops
are
there
but
theres
a
play
between
the
bitterness
and
neutral
sweetness
beer
burps
serviceable
almost
a
session
beer
if
you
dont
want
anything
too
bold
got
this
one
at
the
big
local
supermarket
it
poured
with
two
fingers
of
rocky
bonewhite
head
that
slowly
fell
away
into
a
light
foamy
coating
on
top
of
the
beer
the
color
was
a
spectacular
golden
yellow
with
neplus
quality
clarity
i
could
almost
read
things
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
the
nose
was
both
sweetish
and
metallic
at
the
same
time
mouthfeel
was
on
the
thin
side
with
a
mild
sweetness
on
the
tongue
the
finish
was
really
metallic
however
and
lingered
well
after
the
swallow
oof
it
came
in
a
big
22ounce
can
so
the
price
was
not
something
to
quibble
about
but
there
are
much
better
and
equally
inexpensive
examples
of
the
style
available
give
one
a
try
but
for
me
it
was
a
onceanddone
experience
what
can
i
say
i
was
curious
to
try
it
bc
of
the
can
light
golden
clear
pour
with
a
decent
head
smell
was
surprisingly
skunky
lager
maltyeast
smell
and
watery
with
a
good
amount
of
metal
aroma
and
flavor
just
watery
boring
and
not
particularly
good
at
all
overall
kind
of
a
watery
goldenblonde
ale
flavor
about
it
drinkablity
i
liked
the
allmalt
character
of
this
brew
one
of
the
best
japanese
brews
i
have
had
d
this
is
an
easy
to
drink
beer
mostly
because
its
like
drinking
water
its
not
a
bad
beer
though
its
worth
a
try
at
least
the
flavor
opens
with
crackery
bready
pilsner
malt
mild
and
barely
toasted
soft
grassy
esters
just
a
little
in
there
moving
fluidly
into
a
balanced
hop
finish
soapy
and
lightly
floral
not
terribly
pungent
but
it
does
the
job
carbonation
feels
a
little
blunt
not
as
crisp
as
it
could
be
medium
bodied
the
flavor
sticks
with
you
for
a
while
which
is
nice
minimalist
and
clean
great
presentation
far
better
than
the
regular
sapporo
perfect
for
my
spicy
salmon
roll
overall
still
not
something
i
would
drink
every
day
but
a
good
summer
beer
and
as
an
accompaniment
to
sushi
its
ace
this
one
is
pretty
wellbalanced
for
the
style
some
noble
hop
presence
mixes
in
with
the
malt
while
a
bit
thin
it
does
have
enough
body
to
it
to
not
be
watery
and
its
not
too
fizzy
not
a
bad
epl
at
all
and
a
much
better
choice
than
the
standard
sapporo
imo
drinkability
is
really
where
this
beer
shines
i
was
expecting
something
more
akin
to
the
adjunct
laden
normal
sapporo
that
i
had
to
choke
down
simply
to
cleanse
my
mouth
of
an
unintentionally
large
portion
of
wasabi
but
no
this
surprisingly
sweet
smooth
brew
could
easily
become
my
go
to
beer
when
im
in
the
mood
for
something
cool
and
refreshing
without
alot
of
pretentions
and
such
well
done
d
if
i
could
give
this
beer
extra
credit
it
would
be
for
drinkability
this
is
clean
and
refreshing
with
a
nice
full
simple
malt
flavor
i
would
place
this
at
the
top
of
my
session
beer
list
and
think
this
is
a
great
choice
for
a
summer
beach
beer
especially
in
the
can
i
will
definitely
pick
this
up
again
when
i
want
a
night
of
quantity
without
skimping
too
much
on
quality
ps
drink
responsibly
its
much
more
interesting
and
flavorful
than
the
standard
sapporo
and
well
worth
the
increased
cost
pours
a
golden
straw
color
with
a
steady
head
and
blotchy
lacing
smells
clean
crackery
and
a
touch
of
cooked
vegetable
a
good
bit
of
spicy
hop
is
there
too
has
good
flavors
of
pale
malt
and
honey
theres
a
touch
of
apple
fruitiness
finishes
rather
dry
and
biter
with
a
spicy
hop
flavor
saaz
mouthfeel
is
a
little
fulsome
and
has
delicate
carbonation
impressive
overall
a
nice
beer
a
great
beer
for
a
plate
of
steamers
a
very
decent
beer
to
keep
on
hand
if
you
want
nice
flavor
in
a
light
style
beer
this
is
a
nice
selection
overall
all
its
good
not
great
and
id
prefer
an
elephant
if
im
in
the
mood
for
a
malt
explosion
not
bad
stuff
one
of
the
more
drinkable
beers
in
the
epl
category
canada
no
doubt
by
sapporos
new
aquisition
sleeman
a
hard
pour
gets
a
nice
1
12
head
that
quick
disapates
into
light
lacing
it
is
a
bright
golden
color
very
crisp
looking
nice
soft
aroma
of
grains
taste
is
very
crisp
for
sure
starts
with
the
malt
and
barley
but
finishes
with
a
little
hop
bite
very
drinkable
average
lager
sapporo
reserve
pours
a
deep
gold
body
beneath
a
full
head
of
creamy
bright
white
froth
that
holds
well
and
leaves
some
nice
lace
behind
the
aroma
is
exceptionally
fresh
and
clean
with
welcome
waft
of
hops
that
expresses
flowers
and
trees
after
the
rain
the
body
is
medium
and
its
delicately
crisp
across
the
palate
with
a
fine
median
carbonation
the
flavor
delivers
a
clean
softly
grainy
maltiness
and
some
spicy
herbal
and
floral
hops
that
linger
into
the
dry
finish
its
much
more
interesting
and
flavorful
than
the
standard
sapporo
and
well
worth
the
increased
cost
650
ml
can
poured
into
a
halfliter
bottle
the
small
mouth
and
shape
of
the
top
of
the
can
force
a
somewhat
vigorous
pour
resulting
in
a
colossal
2
inch
head
of
foam
good
head
retention
and
nice
lacing
the
beer
itself
is
brilliant
gold
and
crystal
clear
nose
is
better
than
i
remember
it
with
rather
light
soft
floral
hops
and
a
clean
graininess
the
modest
bitterness
works
well
against
the
slightly
sweet
grain
it
also
is
quite
well
attenuated
hop
flavor
is
only
slight
but
noticibly
noblehops
the
finish
is
clean
and
dry
body
seems
a
tad
watery
cool
can
but
the
beer
i
cant
recommend
generic
malty
alcohol
flavor
just
doesnt
appeal
to
me
but
granted
this
is
better
than
some
overall
medium
bodied
plenty
going
on
for
the
style
but
not
too
busy
very
well
balanced
could
get
more
out
of
this
but
wont
try
just
going
to
enjoy
it
for
what
it
is
the
taste
really
surprised
me
on
this
one
subtle
hoppy
notes
with
a
strong
malty
barley
flavor
balanced
slightly
by
fruity
grape
and
organic
grain
notes
mouthfeel
was
well
carbonated
as
the
appearance
led
on
and
finished
smooth
and
crisp
overall
it
was
definately
drinkable
went
well
with
the
fish
and
wasabi
on
my
sushi
prolly
not
great
as
a
standalone
beer
though
but
worth
your
while
with
a
meal
drinkability
easy
to
drink
very
clean
beer
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
watery
a
pleasant
malt
sweetness
european
hops
dont
linger
poured
into
a
glass
its
a
lighter
golden
colored
beer
with
a
lovely
display
of
carbonation
and
has
a
good
crown
head
to
boot
theres
a
scent
of
dms
mixed
with
a
trace
of
hop
flavor
the
taste
is
stronger
and
for
the
most
part
better
than
that
of
its
european
brewed
counterparts
nice
and
hoppy
with
a
light
sweetness
with
a
grainy
finish
make
up
the
flavor
profile
in
this
beer
i
thought
maybe
it
was
a
bit
undercarbonated
but
otherwise
its
a
pleasing
beer
that
matched
fine
with
teriyaki
chicken
and
shrimp
tempura
i
had
this
from
a
pint
bottle
i
picked
up
at
a
japanese
grocery
store
in
fort
lee
it
poured
an
extremely
brilliantly
clear
golden
liquor
i
was
very
impressed
by
how
bright
it
was
very
little
in
terms
of
aroma
poured
a
decent
frothy
1
finger
head
that
dissipated
very
quickly
the
taste
of
the
beer
was
very
smooth
and
very
drinkable
you
can
taste
the
malt
in
the
aftertaste
mouthfeel
was
very
watery
with
lower
than
average
carbonation
cannot
really
see
the
beer
since
the
vessel
is
opaque
comes
in
a
brown
bottle
i
doubt
it
looks
lihe
anything
other
than
a
clear
golden
lager
foamy
white
head
recedes
quickly
but
trust
me
this
lager
tastes
great
from
these
ceramic
cups
i
need
to
find
them
somewhere
for
home
use
aroma
is
malty
fresh
clean
as
is
taste
superrefreshing
mild
crisp
balanced
bitter
and
malt
very
dry
the
perfect
foil
for
grilled
chicken
parts
ultradrinkable
in
this
context
drinkability
its
better
than
most
pale
euro
macros
but
plenty
of
better
options
d
not
bad
hard
to
find
anything
outstanding
nor
any
glaring
weaknesses
simply
a
refreshing
lager
serve
alone
or
better
with
food
its
good
with
sushi
sapporo
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
a
nice
change
from
typical
american
lagers
or
foreign
ones
for
that
matter
i
was
expecting
a
little
better
but
still
good
enough
the
can
is
pretty
cool
though
mouthfeel
is
metallic
honey
sweet
and
mildly
bitter
this
is
medium
bodied
and
crisp
notes
id
have
to
go
through
my
reviews
but
there
arent
too
many
good
euro
pales
this
sadly
is
one
of
the
better
ones
at
that
sapporo
surprised
me
with
this
offering
and
shows
like
most
breweries
they
are
capable
of
making
a
decent
product
the
thing
that
caught
me
off
guard
with
sapporo
is
the
can
extremely
well
designed
with
reinforcements
and
it
looks
cool
too
props
to
them
on
that
anyways
the
beer
pours
a
bright
yellow
with
little
to
no
head
in
fact
it
leaves
a
ring
in
about
a
minute
time
but
the
beer
doesnt
look
american
lagery
crap
looking
no
smell
to
speak
of
really
which
is
good
means
it
shouldnt
be
offensive
at
all
tastewise
this
beer
is
all
malt
and
i
like
that
malt
malt
and
malt
kind
of
reminds
you
of
sea
salt
and
malt
vinegar
chips
slight
hints
of
corn
in
the
taste
but
i
dont
mind
its
a
very
different
corn
taste
than
something
from
bmc
probably
because
the
malt
is
so
overpowering
pretty
damn
bitter
too
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
heavy
for
a
lager
so
it
puts
it
above
the
curve
the
drinkability
is
average
but
was
totally
expecting
a
budweiser
taste
because
of
the
rice
used
but
this
thing
is
like
a
super
concentrated
version
of
a
bud
a
very
good
lager
if
youre
looking
for
something
different
finishes
dry
too
bad
its
brewed
in
canada
doesnt
really
give
you
the
authenticity
defintely
one
of
the
best
macros
i
have
had
good
lager
and
at
a
fair
price
go
ahead
and
give
this
one
a
try
like
drinking
water
only
tastier
would
be
a
good
beer
to
take
camping
or
to
the
beach
during
the
hot
summer
months
give
it
a
try
and
see
for
yourself
cheers
it
became
very
apparent
that
i
had
not
poured
a
beer
from
a
can
in
a
while
as
the
substantial
head
grew
to
twice
the
size
of
the
actual
liquid
in
my
pint
glass
it
settles
down
soon
enough
and
i
saw
and
smelled
yet
another
seemingly
meaningless
lager
in
front
of
me
not
especially
thirstquenching
but
not
offensive
either
im
sure
you
can
get
all
the
details
from
the
many
other
reviews
so
ill
say
this
i
wouldnt
turn
one
down
for
free
but
would
honestly
prefer
a
mich
jr
straight
from
the
bottle
on
a
hot
summer
day
again
to
me
this
is
very
similar
in
taste
and
aromas
to
miller
genuine
draft
which
is
one
of
the
best
of
the
americans
ive
had
overall
pretty
good
stuff
i
think
its
worth
a
shot
if
you
like
pilsners
can
served
at
genjis
in
midland
mi
pours
golden
amber
with
a
medium
creamy
offwhite
head
with
pretty
good
lacing
aroma
of
corn
and
malt
body
is
typical
for
a
premium
lager
not
too
light
but
not
rich
either
unassertive
malt
and
hops
flavors
dont
really
register
but
at
the
same
time
it
is
flavorful
enough
to
not
be
bland
the
finish
is
mildly
hoppy
drinkable
especially
with
spicy
japanese
food
but
i
wouldnt
bother
with
this
otherwise
overall
i
remember
liking
this
more
i
suspect
this
might
be
an
old
can
but
its
not
bad
i
prefer
this
over
the
sapporo
draft
but
its
not
one
i
would
get
often
cool
can
though
pours
out
to
a
deep
golden
color
with
a
short
lived
white
foam
head
some
lace
medium
level
of
carbonation
aromas
of
light
citrus
and
hops
different
for
the
style
a
touch
of
mild
malt
lingers
in
the
wings
taste
is
fair
grain
malt
light
hops
corn
husk
and
a
touch
of
sour
wheat
not
bad
but
not
exactly
wonderful
mouthfeel
was
slightly
thick
with
a
little
bit
of
sourvinegar
character
average
drinkability
id
have
another
if
it
were
offered
is
this
really
what
they
drink
in
japan
large
650
ml
can
sapporo
reserve
has
a
golden
brown
color
with
a
long
lasting
head
malty
aroma
with
a
little
bit
of
a
wheat
smell
the
flavor
is
mainly
grain
the
flavor
of
alcohol
is
noticable
too
not
too
sweet
thankfully
very
little
offflavor
some
herbal
hop
flavors
come
in
at
the
finish
and
the
high
carbonation
makes
the
finish
seem
slightly
spicy
drinkability
is
good
nothing
special
but
this
beer
is
a
simple
tasty
and
inoffensive
lager
i
think
ive
had
two
other
sapporo
offerings
prior
to
this
one
and
i
dont
remember
being
too
impressed
maybe
its
a
case
of
low
expectations
being
easily
exceeded
but
that
doesnt
change
the
fact
that
reserve
is
good
beer
if
youre
in
the
market
for
a
jpl
japanese
pale
lager
start
here
in
the
end
a
decent
drinkable
beer
pretty
mellow
and
easy
drinking
simple
in
its
profile
but
sometimes
that
a
good
thing
this
has
abit
more
pleasant
taste
than
most
euro
lagers
that
ive
had
it
doesnt
have
that
skunky
smelltaste
to
it
with
the
super
malty
body
and
stink
hop
finish
it
didnt
really
have
any
huge
tastes
that
stood
out
from
the
rest
of
the
beer
which
made
it
pretty
balanced
but
also
bland
on
the
other
hand
it
was
drinkable
and
didnt
leave
a
nasty
aftertaste
i
think
this
would
be
a
good
session
beer
drinkability
a
tasty
import
nothing
special
but
tasty
this
doesnt
quite
do
it
for
me
but
isnt
horrible
just
boring
opinion
well
i
can
say
that
if
you
lined
up
all
of
the
commercialized
light
lagers
that
this
would
be
one
of
the
first
ones
that
i
would
pick
up
it
isnt
my
favorite
beer
but
it
isnt
the
worst
of
the
heap
either
i
wouldnt
seek
this
one
out
but
if
it
turns
out
that
this
is
the
best
the
bar
i
am
at
has
i
would
drink
this
over
water
i
cant
say
the
same
for
miller
i
prefer
sapporo
original
to
this
anyday
rice
in
beer
is
not
always
a
bad
thing
the
nice
thing
about
this
beer
is
the
fancy
can
unlike
regular
sapporo
this
can
has
nice
barley
designs
on
both
sides
of
the
can
very
attractive
this
beer
is
far
more
enjoyable
straight
from
the
can
if
you
must
drink
one
at
all
i
shouldnt
have
worried
this
is
a
nice
beer
it
is
all
malt
so
there
is
absolutely
no
hop
profile
i
have
to
remember
to
rate
by
style
good
carbonation
very
clean
easy
to
drink
great
to
chase
down
some
spicy
sushi
after
a
long
day
good
beer
reviewed

and
taken
from
notes
color
is
straw
but
pours
with
a
haze
head
is
full
bright
white
and
carries
a
nice
lace
nose
shows
hints
of
grass
and
slight
malt
flavor
is
chemical
like
something
definately
wrong
with
this
sample
body
is
very
dry
and
reminds
one
of
medicine
finish
in
omne
word
is
nasty
not
good
cool
can
though
d
no
major
flaws
with
this
beer
its
just
not
very
exciting
the
light
hops
and
light
malt
are
well
balanced
and
compliment
each
other
it
would
be
nice
to
drink
with
a
meal
that
is
very
light
like
sushi
or
tempura
however
any
dish
that
has
any
spice
will
overpower
this
beer
in
one
bite
sinkability

i
enjoyed
their
japanese
rice
lager
that
they
do
but
this
was
just
all
wrong
the
taste
is
likewise
a
tad
sweet
and
the
malts
there
but
its
quickly
bowled
over
by
a
hefty
metallic
aftertaste
thats
not
altogether
pleasent
even
so
this
beers
quite
a
bit
more
tasty
than
the
overall
blandness
of
the
normal
sapporo
ill
declare
this
my
current
favorite
japanese
beer
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
beer
it
was
much
better
than
i
expected
i
will
order
this
the
next
time
i
have
sushi
drinkability
not
bad
i
have
no
idea
why
i
am
having
these
on
a
below
50
degree
day
but
its
still
pretty
damn
quenching
a
pretty
good
beer
i
love
the
can
here
too
unfortunately
that
metallic
taste
brings
my
opinion
of
it
down
a
bit

5great
beer
beautiful
golden
color
this
goes
very
well
with
spicy
food
it
does
have
a
bit
of
the
can
taste
in
it
i
havent
drank
beer
lao
for
over
10
years
and
i
came
across
it
in
99
cents
store
they
have
a
sticker
on
the
can
now
that
denotes
its
gluten
free
did
some
research
and
found
out
that
beer
lao
is
made
from
thais
jasmine
rice
im
not
sure
about
this
gluten
free
fad
but
didnt
even
realize
what
was
the
ingredients
finished
a
whole
6pack
over
the
weekend
spend
a
couple
months
in
laos
for
work
and
got
to
know
this
beer
fairly
well
compare
to
the
local
thai
beer
offerings
like
chang
this
is
definitely
a
step
above
keep
your
expectations
low
and
you
will
be
happy
taste
is
similar
to
asahi
or
other
asian
beer
with
rice
adjunct
however
one
of
the
villages
i
stayed
in
did
not
have
refrigeration
and
we
drank
these
beers
at
80
degrees
in
the
evening
i
couldnt
do
that
with
a
bud
or
miller
so
i
give
this
beer
a
little
love
or
maybe
it
is
nostalgia
no
review
needed
its
an
asian
lager
like
any
other
it
is
a
good
one
however
near
as
good
as
singha
and
went
really
well
with
spicy
laotian
food
try
it
if
you
see
it
but
no
need
to
seek
it
out
i
am
surprised
to
be
honest
i
wasnt
expecting
much
from
a
handsome
500ml
can
i
like
this
beer
and
will
look
forward
to
my
next
drink
o
for
what
i
can
only
assume
is
a
massproduced
beer
this
is
ok
but
hardly
memorable
there
was
a
nice
long
lasting
head
when
i
poured
it
into
the
glass
with
plenty
of
carbonation
rising
to
the
top
many
of
these
type
of
beers
have
heads
that
fade
quickly
so
i
was
impressed
that
it
lasted
almost
as
long
as
it
took
to
drink
it
the
aroma
was
slightly
sweet
expected
from
a
beer
made
with
rice
malt
i
was
prepared
for
the
worst
when
i
took
my
first
swig
but
instead
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
i
would
equate
the
taste
with
budweiser
for
an
import
from
laos
that
may
have
been
months
old
and
could
have
suffered
the
consequences
of
traveling
half
around
the
world
this
lager
was
still
fresh
tasting
and
enjoyable
serving
type
can
great
lager
for
asia
easily
one
of
the
best
available
around
here
in
my
honest
opinion
a
very
nice
one
must
say
if
on
one
hand
it
is
hoppier
and
uses
rice
as
opposed
to
corn
on
another
hand
it
has
a
strong
oxidation
and
sulfuric
notes
dont
let
it
warm
i
started
with
a
higher
note
and
was
forced
to
downgrade
it
along
the
degustation
good
carbonation
along
with
a
slight
acidity
make
this
a
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
beer
great
on
a
hot
summer
day
with
a
plate
of
spicy
peanuts
o
goes
best
with
a
tropical
climate
aftertaste
those
same
sweet
notes
carry
over
and
every
time
i
swallow
it
begins
to
dry
the
burp
is
pretty
boring
tasted
more
like
my
lunch
than
it
did
the
beer
i
am
drinking
this
is
a
beer
regardless
of
the
abv
is
easy
to
drink
and
i
can
see
myself
drinking
a
pitcher
of
this
i
would
also
like
to
visit
laos
for
that
food
i
am
also
going
to
look
into
other
laos
brewing
companies
this
is
good
its
not
great
but
i
could
drink
a
bunch
of
this
carbonated
sweet
nectar
yummy
o
good
body
nice
taste
but
not
outstanding
certainly
great
for
this
part
of
the
world
hits
the
spot
and
is
cheap
for
this
area
cool
can
goes
great
with
pub
food
and
would
be
great
with
lao
thai
fare
o
this
beer
is
rather
drinkable
but
nothing
really
stands
out
about
the
taste
that
would
want
to
make
me
want
to
try
this
again
overall
another
run
of
the
mill
europ
pale
lager
although
this
one
is
better
than
average
paired
really
nice
with
curry
and
pleasant
to
drink
on
a
hot
day
od
from
the
bottle
its
much
better
with
the
bubblegum
and
grass
coming
through
a
lot
more
not
a
poorly
made
lager
by
regional
standards
and
for
the
style
it
can
hold
its
own
drinkable
as
the
flavour
can
hold
its
own
just
barely
not
bad
overall
while
this
is
definitely
not
my
normal
choice
of
beer
style
its
not
badits
crisp
and
flavorful
without
lingering
or
dominating
my
palettei
would
drink
this
beer
with
some
guacamole
and
chips
around
a
poker

i
said
not

for

refreshing
to

id
definitely
consider
this
again
as
a
beer
with
dinner
rjt
overall
quite
a
surprise
i
expected
this
beer
to
be
awful
thanks
to
its
origins
and
the
bottle
but
it
turned
out
to
be
quite
good
decent
lager
with
an
unusual
rice
sweetness
undertone
as
opposed
to
the
rice
simply
being
filler
in
most
asian

i
had
this

a

that
in
my
opinion
is
just
something
cold
to
drink
drinkability
is
good
on
this
beer
very
crisp
refreshing
balanced
beer
however
after
a
while
the
sweetness
and
strong
kick
to
the
mouth
gets
old
surprised
by
how
nice
this
beer
is
overall
not
a
bad
brew
at
all
but
not
intriguing
at
all
i
decided
to
just
dive
right
in
with
my
pour
and
get
the
party
started
i
got
twoplus
foamy
fingers
of
bonewhite
head
and
it
looked
like
fluf
atop
the
beer
color
was
a
pale
lemonyellow
with
nequality
clarity
and
i
knew
that
i
was
not
going
to
be
winning
any
points
in
greg
kochs
eyes
by
drinking
it
but
i
am
not
in
the
business
of
trying
to
impress
others
nose
had
that
sweetish
lagerlike
characteristic
that
i
find
hard
to
define
but
easy
to
recognize
i
also
did
not
recognize
any
adjunct
smells
so
things
were
definitely
looking
up
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
i
was
getting
the
honeylike
sweetness
of
pure
unadulterated
lager
on
my
tongue
winning
man
i
cannot
tell
you
how
many
bad
aals
i
have
put
up
with
in
pursuit
of
the
canquest
tm
but
it
has
been
enough
to
make
me
appreciate
a
simple
lager
free
of
adjuncts
mmmmm
finish
was
semidry
and
it
begged
for
a
pretzel
to
go
with
it
and
by
coincidence
i
had
a
bag
of
hammonds
pretzels
onhand
for
just
such
an
occasion
like
any
time
that
i
am
drinking
beer
dont
bother
to
seek
this
out
but
do
be
aware
that
better
lagers
exist
than
the
bmc
aal
type
of
lager
o
excellent
on
a
hot
day
especially
in
laos
i
imagine
nothing
particularly
distinguishes
this
from
a
number
of
similar
lagers
ive
had
especially
from
countries
in
asia
or
africa
without
a
strong
brewing
culture
o
i
was
surprised
i
was
not
expecting
the
beer
to
be
quite
as
refreshing
as
it
was
due
to
the
average
score
i
found
the
beer
to
be
quite
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
while
i
might
not
run
out
to
get
this
frequently
i
certainly
would
not
turn
it
down
and
i
consider
myself
to
be
a
bit
of
a
beer
snob
this
would
pair
nicely
with
real
spicy
foods
in
fact
i
wish
i
had
some
to
go
with
this
beer
tonight
poured
from
a
brown
11
2
oz
bottle
has
a
pale
yellow
color
with
a
1
inch
head
smell
is
sweet
some
malts
taste
is
crisp
malts
and
grains
not
bad
but
kind
of
mild
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
easy
drinking
but
nothing
special
o
a
pleasant
beer
i
think
it
would
be
great
ice
cold
in
the
tropical
heat
of
laos
o
at
least
they
use
a
brown
bottle
httpabarwithnoname
wordpress
com
d
a
little
flavorful
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
decent
representation
of
style
its
not
a
beer
i
would
drink
too
much
of
unless
my
choices
were
very
limited
o
when
looking
for
a
beer
during
the
thick
weather
of
this
region
im
always
genuinely
thankful
when
this
is
available
it
is
clearly
meant
to
be
crisp
clean
and
simple
rather
than
thoughtfully
analyzed
as
well
as
to
be
consumed
very
soon
after
bottling
ive
had
very
few
other
beers
of
any
style
that
hit
their
intended
mark
so
well
o
not
terrible
actually
its
pretty
solid
for
an
asian
lager
even
displaying
some
likable
qualities
not
something
id
reach
for
on
a
regular
basis
but
not
bad
beerlao
lager
pours
a
golden
yellow
with
a
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
from
a
brown
11
2
ounce
bottle
the
aroma
is
grainy
and
a
touch
sweet
the
flavor
is
very
light
grainy
perhaps
a
touch
of
grass
a
tad
astringent
such
that
its
making
me
thirsty
to
drink
it
i
cant
really
taste
any
hops
and
only
a
note
of
sweetness
that
i
would
identify
as
malt
not
terrible
i
didnt
expect
much
nor
does
this
deliver
much
o
i
probably
wouldnt
drink
it
again
fortunately
the
reason
i
picked
it
up
is
because
it
was
the
last
one
available
in
my
store
and
i
didnt
want
to
miss
out
at
least
trying
it
it
has
some
interesting
notes
but
its
a
little
too
foreign
for
my
personal
taste
drinkability
an
average
beer
in
the
style
pale
lager
well
for
a
lager
from
one
of
the
tropical
countries
one
doesnt
expect
much
more
than
a
pale
watery
thirst
quencher
whose
headiest
attribute
is
its
lack
of
distance
from
the
nearest
fridge
this
offering
on
the
other
hand
is
stamped
from
a
slightly
different
press
it
possesses
a
decent
malt
component
balanced
by
an
adequate
if
not
overly
evident
dryness
i
could
easily
have
another
of
this
given
the
right
conditions
overall
reminds
me
of
the
bargain
beers
in
canada
good
for
the
novelty
of
drinking
a
beer
from
laos
a
country
not
know
for
beer
if
you
get
ahold
of
a
bottle
dont
hesitate
to
try
it
out
for
that
reason
nothing
special
though
taste
is
interesting
but
not
really
in
a
good
way
i
mean
yeah
its
just
grainy
rice
with
an
astringent
sawdust
like
finish
but
there
is
something
else
foreign
on
the
palate
mouthfeel
isnt
helping
at
all
not
quite
a
drain
pour
but
closer
than
id
like
but
hey
laos
this
was
my
revisited
after
i
had
plenty
during
my
trip
to
laos
good
to
see
it
available
on
local
beer
store
good
drinkable
and
nice
refreshing
against
the
local
climate
here
beerlao
lager
is
a
slightly
hazy
pale
gold
with
a
fluffy
white
head
that
has
nice
retention
and
lacing
there
is
spice
and
funk
in
the
aroma
it
smells
fruity
and
sweaty
is
that
a
touch
of
coconut
it
smells
strange
but
sexy
its
pretty
light
bodied
and
sudsy
the
quick
finish
leaves
the
tongue
a
little
numb
there
is
no
bitterness
and
no
sweetness
a
strong
funky
taste
washes
up
and
then
vanishes
there
does
seem
to
be
a
touch
of
coconut
in
here
am
i
crazy
theres
a
fusel
taste
toward
the
finish
it
took
me
a
lot
of
willpower
to
finish
this
little
bottle
not
bad
but
not
a
toptier
beer
either
i
could
quaff
a
few
of
these
on
a
hot
day
and
hey
its
from
laos
d
a
mass
lager
thats
of
surprising
quality
in
all
sense
pleasant
wellbalanced
flavors
with
a
wateryfoamy
smoothness
that
makes
it
so
drinkable
and
sessionable
beer
lao
is
definitely
impressive
for
its
style
4
0
pretty
good
for
the
price
it
is
i
could
drink
a
six
pack
of
this
next
time
im
getting
smashed
had
a
bottle
at
wave
thai
in
queens
with
my
street
noddles
dish
it
wasnt
anything
special
but
it
was
a
nice
wellmade
lager
completely
capable
of
washing
down
spicy
food
frankly
id
take
this
over
most
euro
lagers
this
actually
tasted
faintly
like
a
dortmunder
export
with
soft
bready
malts
and
a
little
bit
of
body
to
it
its
certainly
the
best
asian
lager
ive
had
at
a
thai
place
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
its
very
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
one
of
the
best
examples
of
the
style
i
have
had
i
think
there
is
a
nice
lager
yeast
in
here
because
i
find
this
beer
pretty
smooth
id
like
to
pair
this
beer
up
with
some
thai
or
chinese
food
an
interesting
beer
drinkable
not
half
bad
drinkable
and
refreshing
for
what
it
is
and
a
few
odd
complexities
make
this
one
interesting
drinkability
boy
this
has
been
one
middleoftheroad
beer
its
drinkable
in
a
pinch
but
it
isnt
outstanding
in
any
particular
area
for
better
or
for
worse
ive
never
tried
a
beer
from
former
french
indochina
but
this
one
did
not
disappoint
it
was
a
full
bodied
lager
that
was
enjoyable
i
hope
i
can
find
a
six
pack
but
hey
its
laotian
beer
so
why
not
if
you
have
the
chance
d
not
bad
but
extremely
watery
beer
very
asian
lager
with
notes
of
rice
which
does
not
help
too
much
you
may
see
me
drink
this
if
im
in
some
south
east
asian
jungle
and
this
is
a
safe
alternative
for
water
would
pair
well
with
thai
food
poured
into
standard
pint
glass
revealed
a
minimal
head
which
did
not
persist
the
requisite
amount
of
time
to
impress
most
folks
carbonation
seems
to
be
minimal
yellow
color
typical
of
many
beers
of
this
type
smell
was
pleasing
despite
being
minimal
taste
was
surprisingly
good
with
hints
of
the
normal
ingredients
for
this
type
of
beer
mouthfeel
was
about
as
good
as
it
gets
for
this
type
of
beer
this
was
an
average
lager
but
not
without
merit
i
would
consider
drinking
this
brew
again
if
ever
i
encounter
it
in
a
package
store
the
teen
waitress
found
my
swirling
and
sniffing
in
an
attempt
to
find
something
in
the
nose
quite
humorous
surely
she
sees
foreigners
do
strange
things
but
smelling
beer
there
is
a
general
consensus
among
travelers
in
the
region
that
beerlao
is
better
than
the
other
especially
thai
regional
beers
while
i
am
agreeing
also
note
that
the
competition
is
extremely
weak
as
with
the
others
of
this
ilk
it
is
best
slammed
colud
before
being
allowed
to
warm
it
is
common
for
locals
to
pour
it
into
a
glass
with
ice
to
keep
it
cold
and
the
thinning
isnt
all
that
noticeable
since
it
is
pretty
thin
to
start
with
gives
you
an
idea
of
the
beer
scene
in
se
asia
i
would
drink
this
again
i
wouldnt
go
to
a
store
looking
for
it
but
it
is
something
cool
to
get
once
and
a
while
or
bring
to
a
party
of
beer
drinkers
who
dont
mind
trying
strange
and
new
things
can
chen
definitey
first
beer
from
lao
pours
a
very
clear
yellow
color
with
a
small
foamy
white
head
skunky
corny
malt
malt
bitter
hops
overall
pretty
clean
and
light
refreshing
and
very
easy
to
drink
would
easily
pick
this
over
any
bmc
or
the
like
especially
if
i
knew
it
was
fresh
not
bad
not
bad
a
decent
premium
american
lager
but
it
lacks
the
crisp
dryness
of
a
good
lager
so
thats
it
beer
lao
is
the
beer
over
there
i
guess
it
could
be
worse
but
id
avoid
buying
this
as
an
import
very
drinkable
not
much
here
but
nothing
too
offensive
and
there
is
enough
structure
to
make
it
better
than
an
american
lager
d
this
beer
isnt
offensive
in
flavor
or
aroma
it
is
just
bland
the
bone
white
head
crests
over
a
finger
finespun
enough
that
the
it
collapses
down
to
the
surface
with
ease
nice
thin
traces
of
lacing
retains
a
thin
layer
across
the
surface
washed
out
orange
to
worn
gold
in
color
transparent
but
not
squeaky
clean
per
se
few
bubbles
visible
within
bready
nose
with
a
honeyed
touch
buttered
corn
hay
caramel
no
real
fruit
or
citrus
presence
just
a
slavish
desire
to
please
by
maximizing
sweetness
and
minimizing
anything
which
might
offend
by
requiring
thought
mediumbodied
lowgrade
fizz
for
carbonation
no
surprise
that
the
palate
has
the
same
character
as
the
nose
all
poised
to
please
the
lowest
common
denominator
and
blend
into
the
pack
corn
syrup
maple
syrup
caramel
all
this
makes
it
stick
to
your
mouth
pores
the
hay
or
grass
is
without
edge
has
sufficient
hops
to
have
good
posture
thats
it
no
problem
taking
another
sip
a
step
above
domestic
macrobrews
that
is
its
best
attribute
d
average
drinkability
and
average
enjoyability
better
then
anticipated
no
qualms
about
finishing
but
unlikely
this
would
ever
draw
me
in
again
this
is
not
a
beer
id
care
to
put
to
my
lips
again
should
i
ever
find
myself
in
laos
i
wouldnt
mind
going
for
this
but
it
is
certainly
not
worth
seeking
out
here
in
the
us
thanks
to
my
local
bottle
shop
for
the
sample
the
appearance
is
a
very
light
yellow
mostly
seethrough
with
a
12
finger
head
to
it
the
smell
is
some
sugar
and
light
alcohol
that
is
all
that
my
nose
detects
the
taste
is
more
of
a
light
sweetness
some
of
the
basic
barley
tastes
coming
through
mouthfeel
is
about
the
same
below
average
drinkability
is
ok
would
work
to
pair
with
food
when
you
are
very
hungry
or
had
a
few
beers
so
i
can
say
i
have
drank
this
beer
now
but
i
do
not
plan
on
drinking
it
ever
again
badly
flawed
to
be
avoided
not
bad
at
all
one
of
the
joys
of
drinking
round
the
world
as
i
am
trying
to
do
is
finding
little
gems
like
this
in
the
most
unlikely
places
i
wont
try
this
one
again
went
ok
with
my
vietnamese
cuisine
but
i
could
have
chosen
any
beer
offered
and
it
would
have
had
the
same
effect
a
mouth
washer
at
best
i
cant
imagine
sitting
at
home
and
sipping
one
of
these
let
alone
having
a
6
to
get
through
drinkability
not
a
beer
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
buy
at
home
but
i
found
it
more
drinkable
than
most
of
the
options
in
thailand
notes
from
72906
drinkability
a
beer
to
not
only
unite
an
entire
nation
of
peoples
but
also
to
supremely
represent
a
country
that
traces
its
ancient
origins
all
the
way
back
to
the
kingdom
of
lan
xang
land
of
a
million
elephants
man
thats
a
pretty
tall
order
but
as
laos
is
a
relatively
impoverished
and
oppressed
place
id
say
beer
lao
really
fits
the
bill
from
a
twelve
ounce
bottle
pours
a
clear
pale
yellow
below
average
carbonation
and
lacing
smells
of
mild
malts
and
mild
hops
maybe
some
rice
first
sip
is
surprisingly
lighter
than
expected
some
mild
bitterness
weak
malt
backbone
on
a
whole
not
very
good
many
expats
in
thailand
look
forward
to
a
lao
visa
run
so
that
they
can
stock
up
on
beerlao
its
nothing
amazing
but
its
very
drinkable
and
you
can
down
several
bottles
for
cheap
0
70
without
suffering
the
instahangover
that
comes
from
thai
beer
it
must
be
the
sandfiltered
water
dactually
quite
decent
this
is
one
of
the
better
lagers
ive
had
from
countries
not
known
for
their
brewing
knowhow
d
not
horrible
i
guess
ok
in
hot
se
asian
weather
wouldnt
drink
by
choice
though
so
in
the
end
beer
lao
is
really
nothing
special
in
the
grand
scheme
of
things
but
its
cheap
and
cheerful
its
tastier
and
far
more
drinkable
than
anything
else
out
there
in
laos
or
in
the
rest
of
se
asia
it
wont
leave
your
skull
thumping
after
a
few
like
beer
chang
and
it
just
tastes
better
than
singha
drink
up
while
youre
there
but
dont
bother
bringing
any
home
beerlao
is
best
enjoyed
in
a
large
extra
cold
bottle
on
the
banks
of
the
mekong
river
i
was
recently
in
laos
and
consumed
on
average
1015
bottles
a
day
its
hard
not
to
at
1
for
a
liter
and
thats
bar
prices
i
bought
some
in
the
smaller
bottles
upon
my
return
to
the
us
from
a
thai
supermarket
and
it
wasnt
as
good
may
have
been
a
combination
of
the
hothumid
storage
conditions
and
the
amount
of
time
the
bottles
had
been
sitting
on
a
shelf
regardless
this
is
a
very
refreshing
beer
that
i
much
prefer
to
singhatigerleochang
and
other
se
asian
beers
nice
crisp
taste
with
no
bad
aftertaste
pours
a
good
head
and
is
quite
carbonated
worth
a
try
if
you
ever
visit
laos
the
stuff
is
100
unavoidable
only
2
beers
served
in
the
whole
country
notes
pass
on
this
one
a
filthy
finish
leaves
the
palate
greased
and
filmy
sweetened
malts
are
annoying
as
well
ughhhh
fits
in
well
with
most
of
the
other
beers
from
this
region
its
not
overly
different
but
its
done
quite
well
it
is
however
different
enough
from
the
generic
swill
in
cambodia
to
make
a
nice
change
pours
a
four
finger
white
head
that
fades
quickly
leaving
no
lace
crystal
clear
pale
amber
color
very
light
carbonation
and
light
bodied
skunky
nose
starts
almost
sweet
corny
just
as
bad
as
macau
beer
hops
at
the
finish
far
eastern
countries
have
trouble
making
good
beer
bought
this
only
to
add
a
new
country
to
my
collection
1
50
for
a
330ml
bottle
from
liquid
solutions
tigard
or
on
a
hot
day
to
quench
a
thirst
it
would
be
just
fine
believe
it
or
not
this
beer
has
won
awards
in
international
competitions
and
is
supposed
to
be
one
of
the
most
consistently
brewed
beers
in
se
asia
a
crisp
fairly
clean
finish
not
overly
bitter
like
so
many
other
lagers
body
is
medium
for
the
style
considering
i
usually
dont
drink
lagers
i
thought
this
a
good
brew
for
the
style
ive
actually
drunk
this
in
laos
where
it
comes
in
lovely
big
bottles
the
nicest
beer
in
southeast
asia
in
my
opinion
its
very
much
a
hot
countrys
beer
beautifully
hoppy
and
refreshing
i
think
some
of
the
tasters
here
have
sampled
compromised
stock
post
script
halfway
in
its
not
so
bad
maybe
i
warmed
up
to
it
clear
gold
visible
carbonation
decent
head
very
light
grainy
malt
in
the
nose
and
not
much
else
taste
is
that
of
manya
import
macro
styled
lagers
maybe
a
bit
mroe
grassymalt
than
the
rest
but
still
not
anything
great
carbonation
is
pretty
good
although
it
does
little
to
help
out
the
overall
experience
of
this
beer
probably
only
distributed
here
because
of
the
far
flung
brewing
location
other
than
that
there
is
no
reason
to
buy
this
light
malts
that
fade
into
a
clean
finish
that
has
a
generic
hop
flavor
way
more
balanced
and
clean
than
domestic
macros
better
than
the
average
mouthfeel
no
awkward
flavors
or
rabid
carbonation
id
grab
it
over
most
of
the
usual
suspect
us
macros
beer
lao
was
something
of
a
surprise
its
definitely
different
from
anything
that
ive
had
before
and
is
pretty
okay
though
offbeat
ill
order
it
in
a
heartbeat
if
i
ever
find
myself
in
a
laotian
restaurant
strangely
enough
i
was
recently
given
directions
to
the
favorite
laotian
restaurant
of
a
laotian
acquaintance
of
mine
perhaps
ill
pop
in
some
evening
and
see
if
beer
lao
is
on
the
menu
pours
a
crystal
clear
pale
yellow
with
large
army
of
bubbles
racing
to
towards
a
modest
white
head
the
smell
is
a
musty
sweet
corn
and
light
malt
aroma
almost
american
macroey
the
taste
is
a
couple
notches
above
the
macro
scene
though
and
is
fairly
interesting
it
unleashes
a
nice
wave
of
black
pepper
light
fruit
faint
malt
and
a
hint
of
hops
nice
this
is
a
light
bodied
brew
that
finishes
slightly
dry
and
it
drinks
down
super
easy
i
have
to
say
that
i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
would
have
it
again
if
the
scenario
was
right
cheers
this
beer
poured
a
clear
light
yellow
color
with
very
little
carbonation
but
with
creamy
white
foam
that
settled
fairly
quickly
the
smell
was
mildly
malty
with
a
bit
of
hops
and
a
touch
of
grain
the
taste
was
light
malt
some
hop
bitterness
some
sweetness
and
a
graincorn
flavor
the
mouthfeel
was
crisp
with
light
body
and
low
carbonation
the
slightly
sweet
flavor
lingered
this
beer
was
ok
as
a
complement
to
spicy
laotian
food
but
i
would
not
seek
it
out
otherwise
elmocoso
just
dont
like
this
beer
had
it
in
a
restaurant
in
vienna
wasnt
impressed
overall
one
of
the
best
pale
lagers
ive
ever
had
cleaner
and
crisper
than
others
in
the
style
and
more
of
a
floral
feel
to
it
o
a
cross
between
a
munich
helles
and
a
czech
pilsner
slightly
forgettable
but
i
wouldnt
refuse
another
if
offered
one
gosser
pours
from
the
11
2
ounce
bottle
a
cloudy
yellow
color
with
fairly
thin
foam
some
lacing
reluctantly
stuck
to
the
glass
and
trailed
the
liquid
surface
down
not
the
most
attractive
thing
but
beer
nonetheless
the
aroma
has
a
strong
bread
charactervery
doughycoming
from
its
pale
malt
this
theme
continues
on
the
palate
and
is
joined
by
a
hint
of
sulfur
and
metallic
a
carbonated
finish
is
tinged
with
the
slightest
bitterness
this
beer
exceeded
expectations
which
were
not
very
high
to
begin
with
pours
a
two
finger
white
head
that
fades
quickly
leaving
no

gösser
is
exactly
the
kind
of
serviceable
and
wellconstructed
lager
youd
expect
from
a
nation
of
people
who
appreciate
good
beer
like
to
drink
a
lot
of
it
but
dont
care
much
to
deviate
from
what
theyre
accustomed
to
it
is
a
good
nationalbrand
lager
though
like
any
nationalbrand
lager
the
country
produces
better
brands
that
are
simply
harder
to
come
by
o
this
beer
might
seem
to
be
somewhat
bland
but
its
extremely
drinkable
and
doesnt
have
any
offflavors
or
skunk
the
fruity
aromas
and
flavors
seem
to
be
a
little
unusual
for
a
lager
as
opposed
to
an
ale
and
might
be
a
byproduct
of
the
austrian
water
overall
i
thought
that
this
beer
wasnt
that
bad
compared
to
others
in
the
style
o
good
drinkability
classic
easidrinking
german
lager
recommended
good
balanced
sort
of
flavours
sweet
malts
some
grain
lighter
bitterness
here
than
in
the
smell
a
well
rounded
brew
that
i
find
satisfying
and
a
good
price
8
69
for
the
6
pack
of
11
2
oz
bottles
not
as
good
as
the
dark
but
like
i
said
satisfying
overall
it
wasnt
great
but
i
would
have
a
pint
of
this
lager
before
any
macro
in
fact
it
was
better
than
other
euro
pale
lagers
i
have
tried
it
surpassed
most
beers
from
polland
i
have
tried
zubr
warka
zywiec
not
worth
a
detour
but
if
it
is
available
give
it
a
try
its
enjoyable
o
gösser
is
a
classic
party
beer
amongst
my
friends
the
flavours
are
small
but
nice
and
its
very
easy
to
drink
well
those
are
its
best
features
the
beer
is
also
great
with
salty
snacks
and
lighter
food
like
peanuts
or
sandwiches
clear
and
pale
yellow
with
a
white
fingerhigh
cap
that
dissipated
over
a
few
minutes
leaving
behind
a
thin
skim
of
bubbles
coating
the
surface
there
was
a
bit
of
shortlived
spotty
lacing
mild
aroma
with
light
notes
of
grainy
malt
noble
hops
spicy
and
floral
and
fruity
esters
clean
mild
flavour
with
some
dry
malts
up
front
low
bitterness
floral
and
grassy
and
a
hint
of
spicy
hops
in
the
finish
light
bodied
moderate
carbonation
fair
texture
a
passable
euro
lager
but
ultimately
forgettable
final
grade
3

a
c
overall
this
is
a
pretty
average
beer
it
is
drinkable
but
not
special
for
any
reason
o
not
a
lot
here
a
refreshing
highly
drinkable
brew
and
a
decent
beer
but
if
this
is
austrias
finest
beer
im
wont
be
going
to
austria
anytime
soon
3
i
bought
this
thinking
it
was
the
dark
how
disappointed
am
i
1
very
average
beer
d
easily
drinkable
but
not
all
that
memorable
would
quench
your
thirst
on
a
hot
day
but
theres
more
flavourful
offerings
that
i
would
choose
over
this
one
drink
just
another
average
euro
beer
nothing
worth
seeking
out
pours
a
clean
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
in
the
aroma
a
faint
skunkiness
sweet
malt
and
kind
of
standard
lager
like
smells
in
the
taste
a
small
dryness
a
light
malt
and
actually
no
real
taste
at
all
a
smooth
and
light
and
watery
mouthfeel
with
a
small
dry
malt
in
the
aftertaste
thin
no
real
taste
and
lack
there
of
aroma
taste
is
nice
full
grain
plenty
of
tingly
almost
minty
herbal
hop
bitterness
a
light
mineral
quaility
it
leans
slightly
to
a
leaner
less
malty
hoppier
and
more
bitter
side
so
its
more
like
a
very
good
if
not
great
german
pilsner
in
taste
and
feel
rather
than
a
helles
or
czech
pilsner
i
would
say
that
this
is
really
a
german
pilsner
but
it
falls
well
under
the
europ
pale
lager
category
too
being
a
bit
simpler
and
with
a
thinness
and
faint
roughness
to
the
character
however
although
not
among
the
best
german
pilsners
it
is
far
better
than
many
other
german
pilsners
ive
had
and
is
very
good
as
far
as
euro
umlaut
lager
is
concerned
this
one
aint
bad
i
just
really
wish
brewers
would
stop
throwing
around
the
best
beer
or
finest
beer
moniker
on
their
labels
cause
this
one
sure
isnt
still
a
highly
drinkable
lager
and
a
decent
summer
brew
picked
up
a
500
ml
can
proclaims
to
be
austrias
finest
beer
lets
give
it
a
whirl
from
the
first
smell
this
must
be
an
adjunct
this
brew
smells
like
corn
and
more
corn
checking
the
label
it
says
kornmalt
which
appears
to
be
in
line
with
my
assumptions
the
beer
pours
to
a
bright
yellow
with
a
thin
head
that
dissipates
quickly
the
taste
is
well
corny
tastes
kind
of
like
a
corn
mash
that
got
fermented
way
short
of
moonshine
very
similar
taste
to
chicha
a
fermented
corn
beverage
sold
in
the
colombian
countryside
taste
aside
from
corny
is
sweet
and
dry
no
real
bitterness
to
speak
of
consistent
throughout
for
fermented
corn
its
not
bad
for
beer
its
not
to
good
well
if
this
is
austrias
finest
beer
i
wont
be
seeking
out
any
more
brew
from
austria
notes
a
decent
beer
for
when
you
want
just
something
easy
and
inoffensive
to
drink
refreshing
pilsener
but
a
bit
too
thin
and
not
enough
flavor
to
really
be
good
the
beer
smells
as
a
pilsner
should
fresh
with
a
light
citrus
smell
the
head
is
very
white
and
stays
for
a
while
nice
carbonation
d
i
like
this
beer
it
isnt
the
most
refreshing
beer
out
there
due
to
a
thicker
body
than
what
is
typical
and
is
a
flavorful
beer
overall
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
its
clean
and
would
be
a
good
session
beer
but
might
change
up
after
2
or
3
a
nice
austrian
brew
gösser
gives
you
a
very
respectable
light
european
lager
it
pours
a
light
shade
of
gold
with
a
white
head
that
seems
to
linger
a
little
bit
the
beer
smells
slightly
skunky
but
has
a
good
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
a
nice
amount
of
carbonation
the
drinkability
is
very
high
for
this
beer
it
is
easy
to
drink
and
doesnt
really
have
much
of
an
aftertaste
if
youre
looking
for
a
decent
light
lager
then
give
gösser
a
try
taste
this
tastes
kind
of
fake
and
the
lemon
citrusy
taste
that
comes
through
is
that
off
citrus
taste
that
lemon
cleaning
products
have
otherwise
it
is
a
typical
not
too
bad
drinkable
euro
pale
it
paired
perfectly
with
some
delicious
homemade
cheesy
bread
i
imagine
it
would
be
great
with
almost
any
other
food
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
i
know
as
it
far
exceeded
my
expectations
d
i
could
see
myself
drinking
this
paired
with
food
but
not
so
much
as
a
stand
alone
beer
i
would
drink
solely
to
enjoy
light
bodied
with
spritzy
carbonation
thin
and
watery
its
not
a
drain
pour
but
i
wont
be
having
it
again
poured
from
a
green
bottle
into
a
weizen
glass
has
a
pale
gold
color
with
a
1
inch
head
aroma
is
fairly
mild
there
is
a
light
bitterness
but
not
a
lot
of
flavor
from
this
beer
feels
watery
and
bitter
in
mouth
drinkability
is
good
it
goes
down
smooth
overall
a
mediocore
brew
overall
better
than
average
for
the
style
the
canned
version
reviewed
here
isnt
bad
no
tinges
of
metallic
taste
etc
i
do
have
to
say
that
it
is
better
on
tap
complimented
some
nice
austrian
comfort
food
pretty
well
drinkability
decent
enough
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
have
another
d
this
is
an
interesting
enough
beer
that
would
be
pretty
easy
to
throw
a
few
of
them
back
in
one
session
this
is
definitely
a
little
more
interesting
than
your
average
euro
lager
but
not
something
that
i
would
go
out
and
purchase
again
worth
a
try
overall
for
the
price
its
just
terrible
avoid
d
this
is
a
slightly
more
interesting
version
of
your
standard
euro
lager
with
a
nice
mouthfeel
and
a
refreshing
taste
although
not
amazing
its
pretty
nice
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
watery
and
i
struggled
to
finish
my
can
so
id
rate
drinkability
quite
low
as
well
austria
i
wonder
how
you
feel
about
this
being
labeled
as
your
finest
comes
out
of
the
tap
a
clear
golden
yellow
with
a
fairly
thick
and
finebubbled
head
aroma
is
strong
and
crisp
and
has
a
faint
citrus
hint
flavor
is
typically
lagerish
but
with
a
little
more
depth
than
most
lagers
texture
is
clean
crisp
and
smooth
worth
a
try
the
problem
with
austrian
beers
will
be
similar
to
the
problem
with
swiss
beers
i
guess
the
water
is
too
hard
this
usually
gives
a
light
bodied
beer
with
a
soury
note
ok
as
a
thirst
quencher
in
summer
but
not
a
beer
to
enjoy
the
carbonation
is
average
the
bubbles
medium
the
liquid
is
a
bit
smooth
d
not
bad
at
all
could
be
a
very
nice
session
lager
or
a
good
beer
to
woo
your
bmc
friends
away
from
the
macro
crap
lagers
that
are
prevalent
in
the
states
euro
lagers
are
never
really
mind
blowing
but
they
are
light
years
ahead
of
our
domestic
shitlagers
compared
to
some
of
the
usual
bmc
suspects
this
one
might
hold
its
own
for
throwing
back
a
few
during
a
ball
game
but
i
didnt
think
it
was
anything
special
drinkability
fairly
bland
even
for
the
style
and
i
could
certainly
do
without
all
the
sourness
i
was
quite
impressed
if
this
is
the
beer
of
austria
it
cant
be
so
bad
d
this
is
a
very
easy
drinking
euro
pale
lager
that
i
could
drink
in
great
quantities
this
is
a
good
candidate
for
a
foreign
session
beer
as
it
is
wellbalanced
with
good
but
not
outstanding
flavor
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
the
style
but
this
is
a
solid
simple
lager
worth
trying
out
i
tried
this
beer
after
purchasing
it
from
the
local
lcbo
store
the
beer
poured
a
medium
translucent
gold
colour
into
a
glass
with
a
loose
white
head
that
disappeared
within
minutes
the
odour
was
similar
to
many
pale
lager
types
with
a
hint
of
hops
the
mouthfeel
was
clean
crisp
and
light
the
flavour
wasnt
very
hoppy
at
all
not
too
many
discernable
flavours
if
any
pours
a
pale
golden
color
topped
by
a
small
tight
white
head
that
dissipates
after
only
a
few
minutes
aroma
of
slightly
skunked
adjunct
malt
is
evident
as
soon
as
the
cap
is
popped
light
notes
of
moderately
bitter
pops
and
pilsner
malt
but
mainly
skunk
palate
is
a
balance
between
mildly
sweet
adjunct
malt
and
some
slightly
skunked
hops
mouthfeel
is
typical
of
a
euro
lager
light
and
a
touch
creamy
i
suppose
i
could
put
a
few
of
these
back
but
its
not
exactly
a
memorable
experience
pours
a
pale
straw
color
with
a
nice
and
fluffy
white
head
that
so
far
has
left
a
wall
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
faint
and
grainy
has
that
euro
green
bottle
skunk
smell
the
taste
is
of
light
grassy
noble
hops
grainy
malt
and
a
metallic
skunk
taste
the
feel
is
watery
and
dull
doesnt
really
have
that
crisp
taste
of
a
lager
a
typical
euro
lager
sample
probably
a
notch
above
the
mainstream
euro
lagers
easy
drinking
good
for
summer
weather
quite
surprised
by
this
austrian
export
poured
a
bright
pale
yellow
with
a
very
slight
haze
the
head
was
tight
and
compact
lasting
well
over
5
minutes
a
sharp
aroma
of
noble
hops
with
perhaps
a
faint
smell
of
malt
in
the
nose
the
lager
was
fairly
well
balanced
a
bit
sweet
in
the
middle
with
a
nice
dry
hoppiness
in
the
finish
while
not
a
great
lager
it
does
tower
of
most
massed
produced
eurolagers
closer
to
a
north
german
pils
than
a
dortmunder
export
so
what
is
good
about
this
beer
well
it
is
delicate
and
drinkable
it
lacks
many
of
the
flaws
that
i
see
in
american
macrolagers
while
still
trying
to
be
as
close
to
water
as
possible
pale
yellow
beer
left
virtually
no
head
smelt
of
faint
hops
and
grain
taste
was
very
light
compared
to
other
euro
pale
lagers
subtle
hops
and
malts
were
noted
a
bit
thin
on
the
palate
but
overall
a
smooth
easy
drinking
beer
would
certainly
have
this
on
a
hot
summers
day
this
beer
pours
a
boring
golden
color
with
a
moderate
head
the
smell
is
much
like
a
pilsner
with
a
hint
of
wheat
and
a
bit
of
sweetness
the
taste
doesnt
have
much
too
it
but
is
mostly
like
a
wheaty
lager
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
that
keeps
the
taste
dancing
on
your
tongue
just
long
enough
for
you
to
enjoy
it
there
is
also
nothing
with
the
aftertaste
to
be
desired
this
beer
would
be
great
if
youre
looking
to
down
many
of
them
but
as
far
as
a
craft
brew
goes
it
falls
well
below
par
pours
a
pale
gold
close
to
yellow
with
virtually
no
head
and
not
much
rising
carbonation
at
first
it
smells
like
a
heineken
but
that
hoppy
note
fades
over
time
and
a
slight
palte
malt
aroma
comes
out
on
the
palate
slightly
creamy
malts
grainy
at
the
midpalate
finishes
dry
theres
not
much
there
but
nothing
offensive
either
mouthfeel
is
thin
a
bit
watery
without
any
brisk
carbonation
overall
theres
not
a
helluva
a
lot
to
like
here
but
compared
to
other
lagers
of
this
type
theres
very
little
to
dislike
id
take
this
over
a
heineken
or
stella
any
day
ive
had
a
hard
time
categorizing
the
austrian
beers
because
theyre
less
hoppy
than
their
german
or
czech
cousins
pretty
balanced
light
beer
will
lose
the
battle
to
an
average
czech
or
bavarian
lager
but
clearly
a
winner
over
other
austrian
pale
beers
first
taste
is
quite
hoppy
and
earthy
very
pleasant
and
refreshing
grassy
hops
move
on
to
reveal
a
quite
pleasant
and
mellow
sweet
malt
presence
this
is
a
much
more
hoppy
beer
than
i
expected
though
closer
to
a
pils
than
a
euro
pale
a
bit
thin
in
the
mouth
but
goes
down
very
dry
and
quaffs
well
quite
a
refreshing
beer
extremely
enjoyable
but
possibly
miscategorized
d
drinkability
is
really
high
you
could
take
a
few
of
these
down
in
the
summer
no
doubt
overall
soft
inoffensive
and
a
low
key
euro
lager
just
well
boring

i

i
found
a

would
definitely
make

a
fine

the
style
and
its
quite
a

too
when
poured

of

its
more
of
a
solid

feel

taste
but
as
a
pale
lager
its
a
bit
short
it
looks
nice
but
the
taste
and
the
smell
are
undesireable
straw
color
with
little
body
and
a
bitter
aftertaste
not
a
good
austrian
beer
a
weak
lager
and
not
a
great
representation
of
austrian
brewing
it
is
good
on
a
hot
day
when
it
is
served
very
cold
but
for
the
price
should
be
avoided
and
a
wheat
or
abbey
tripel
could
be
more
enticing
gösser
is
the
only
austrian
beer
i
have
found
to
date
so
what
beer
style
should
it
taste
like
this
mild
lager
is
strawgold
in
color
and
very
clear
theres
an
herbal
quality
to
the
lightmedium
malt
the
hop
bitterness
is
unique
in
that
they
possess
a
pectin
and
limelike
flavor
smooth
and
velvety
clean
and
refreshing
and
a
low
amount
of
aftertaste
good
summer
brew
for
the
sausage
cookout
pretty
much
all
i
can
ask
for
in
a
beer
i
enjoyed
this
beer
it
was
nothing
spectacular
but
i
could
sit
in
a
pub
preferably
in
austria
and
drink
this
all
night
a
great
beer
for
hanging
out
and
having
a
few
clear
bright
yellow
hue
small
but
wellretained
head
sweetly
aromatic
from
afar
a
little
floral
dry
hops
on
the

side
with
a
touch
more
sweetness
i
was
a
bit
put
off
by
an
initial
resemblance
in
the
aroma
to
typical
american
lagers
but
that
soon
passed
decent
but
short
finish
clean
and
smooth
but
woefully
short
on
flavor
of
any
kind
pretty
much
lockinstep
with
any
old
lager
light
body
minimal
texture
nothing
terrible
here
but
absolutely
nothing
to
remember
it
by
either
pours
very
clean
with
a
decent
white
head
good
hoppiness
very
crisp
and
clean
tasting
tends
to
be
a
little
skunky
light
in
body
but
big
in
flavor
goes
down
smooth
and
lingers
with
a
spritzy
lemonlike
taste
overall
i
recommend
this
beer
serve
at
a
medium
temperature
a
good
summer
beer
to
drink
outside
pretty
thin
and
horrible
too
fizzy
aswell
yellow
appearance
with
fizzy
mineral
water
head
no
aroma
and
pretty
close
to
noe
flavour
perhaps
a
bit
of
malt
in
there
but
too
bland
in
my
books
gosser
this
is
an
austrian
import
that
seems
very
popular
in
my
area
and
is
virtually
always
on
sale
it
is
sold
in
green
bottles
and
has
a
similar
aroma
to
other
eurolagers
with
that
faint
skunk
aroma
however
the
taste
is
much
lighter
and
refreshing
than
a
heineken
for
example
and
went
down
very
very
well
this
is
a
smooth
beer
that
is
worth
a
look
notes
found
this
at
the
bottom
of
the
shelves
at
my
local
ghetto
package
store
came
in
a
12pack
box
to
my
surprise
gösser
turned
out
to
be
a
very
nice
alternative
to
the
us
norm
lager
very
enjoyable
and
flavourful
great
all
around

citrus
twist

a

touch
with

with

to

my

90
drinkability
this
lager
has
more
flavor
than
a
typical
lager
though
it
isnt
one
of
my
favorite
lagers
nice
a
quality
lager
gives
the
impression
of
having
been
properly
matured
looks
the
part
with
a
relatively
subtle
aroma
of
hops
and
yeast
this
is
reflected
in
the
flavour
accompanied
by
a
decisive
bitterness
good
body
for
the
style
it
envelops
the
palate
didnt
pick
up
on
the
grapefruit
but
it
really
doesnt
matter
a
great
beer
from
a
brewery
that
knows
what
its
doing
well
worth
sampling
if
you
come
across
it
overall
good
beer
if
youre
after
a
good
quality
lager
this
is
much
pretty
spot
on
o
not
bad
at
all
bitter
but
not
biting
somewhat
surprised
and
delighted
by
the
malty
goodness
looks
and
tastes
a
good
bit
german
as
in
kölsch
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
very
crisp
and
refreshing
taste
delicious
zesty
and
piney
flavor
bitter
aftertaste
this
is
definitively
among
the
top
range
of
beers
with
high
drinkability
i
have
tasted
so
far
with
this
i
believe
ive
tried
all
the
harviestoun
beers
available
on
our
shores
i
dig
what
these
guys
do
good
quaffer
for
those
warmer
days
aroma
is
mainly
husky
grains
bready
malts
and
fairly
floral
in
the
hop
department
feels
very
smooth
as
if
on
nitro
creamy
and
medium
bodied
malt
forward
english
in
character
with
a
pleasant
hop
bitterness
that
lingers
in
the
aftertaste
full
flavored
and
full
bodied
for
a
lager
pretty
nice
in
fact
would
drink
this
regularly
if
it
was
more
widely
available
pretty
decent
brew
poured
at
a
good
temperature
with
a
nice
foamy
frothy
offwhite
head
that
settles
after
a
bit
and
a
smidgen
of
lace
color
is
a
gold
amber
with
lots
of
bubble
trails
aroma
is
fresh
beer
malt
hop
a
little
fruit
and
spice
flavors
like
nose
plus
sweet
in
the
front
bittler
on
top
tang
on
the
sides
some
grain
and
a
little
hop
floral
body
and
carbonation
are
excellent
finish
is
like
flavor
of
average
length
and
very
easy
drinking
tasty
but
a
little
pricey
poured
from
a
500ml
bottle
its
great
to
have
harviestoun
beers
in
bc
they
are
perfect
examples
of
how
beers
can
be
small
but
flavourful
bc
brewers
could
learn
a
thing
or
two
from
them
this
lager
pours
a
bright
golden
colour
fruity
honey
aromas
with
floral
notes
pour
forth
great
easydrinking
mouthfeel
with
enough
hops
on
the
finish
to

a
terrific
session
beer
for
summer
overall
a
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
pale
lager
i
would
definitely
have
this
again

it

for

to

if
you
can
o
this
lager
is

to
drink
and
has
some

with

overall
surprisingly

really

love
this
beer
this
is
my
favorite
beer
to
have
with
thai
food
it
goes
especially
well
with
spicy
thai
chilly
basil
it
certainly
beats
the
usual
bmc
offerings
as
well
as
the
japanese
adjuncts
nicely
balanced
between
malts
and
hops
finishes
slightly
bitter
an
okay
beer
but
nothing
much
to
make
it
stand
out
okay
look
and
smell
but
taste
a
little
too
watery
for
me
and
not
much
on
mouthfeel
overall
i
would
group
it
with
other
average
beers
somewhat
sweet
and
filmy
for
such
a
thin
beer
slightly
metallic
not
outright
terrible
but
nothing
redeemable
about
it
either
my
favorite
asian
beer
good
taste
got
a
kick
to
it
i
love
it
i
was
thisrty
and
i
could
chose
a
tick
or
some
wather
i
made
the
wrong
choice
o
bad
for
being
from
thailand
its
a
very
tasty
beer
its
not
bad
at
all
no
after
tastes
when
overseas
and
parched
this
will
do
the
trick
otherwise
nothing
amazing
thailand
is
not
known
for
their
beer
this
beer
wasnt
too
bad
singha
used
to
be
the
main
local
beer
20
years
ago
but
now
is
considered
premium
compared
to
the
even
cheaper
and
crappier
offerings
like
chang
and
leo
it
is
still
not
very
good
but
better
than
those
other
ones
the
best

piss

thai
beer
at

not

many

it
wasnt

besides
that
its
pretty

much
like

this
is
a
pale

clear

grainy
with
little

appropriately
so
overall
an
excellent
euro
lager
that
has
some
real
flavor
i
was
not
expecting
such
a
tasty
beer
from
thailand
i
am
neutral
on
this
beer
one
of
my
favorite
asian
beers
awesome
on
a
hot
humid
day
in
bangkok
otherwise
pretty
average
mass
produced
lager
quite
drinkable
and
pleasant
perhaps
a
step
up
from
ordinary
overall
a
not
half
bad
beer
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
most
beers
out
of
asia
tend
to
be
watery
and
bland
but
this
beer
had
a
decent
flavor
and
was
refreshing
wouldnt
drink
everyday
but
i
will
definatly
pick
it
up
again
the
next
time
i
go

the

clean
taste
really
is

this
poured
a
light
amber
gold
with
a
fat
creamy
head
of
white
foam
clear
and
had
bubbles
rising
to
the
top
lovely
presentation
you
could
call
it
glorious
the
nose
is
sweetened
grain
it
has
a
richness
on
the
nose
that
is
deep
a
slight
hop
herbal
grass
to
sweeten
it
it
drinks
well
hearty
grain
dry
and
robust
with
plenty
of
depth
and
the
hops
are
accents
they
add
some
sweet
herbal
grass
to
the
palate
for
definition
and
depth
the
beer
has
a
medium
mouthfeel
and
is
not
shy
i
would
call
it
forcefull
in
its
malt
stature
the
malt
is
the
drink
its
pleasing
and
leaves
with
a
slight
bit
of
dryness
and
maybe
an
earthiness
that
you
could
call
bitter
this
was
made
by
a
thai
brewer
who
got
his
training
in
germany
and
its
evdent
in
this
beer
tall
golden
liquid
grain
with
a
an
enthusiastic
and
crisp
presence
not
a
bad
beer
with
thai
food
but
i
wouldnt
recommend
it
with
much
else
the
overall
rating
is
quite
low
it
is
not
specially
tasty
but
it
is
quite
easy
to
drink
this
is
only
a
slight
step
above
the
typical
american
macro
lager
its
high
points
are
how
easy
drinking
it
is
and
its
a
tick
from
thailand
but
other
than
that
its
nothing
to
write
home
about
poured
into
a
shaker
pint
glass
pours
a
medium
straw
amber
with
a
thin
white
head
that
dissipates
to
a
thin
ring
around
the
glass
with
little
lacing
served
in
a
cold
glass
at
a
restaurant
and
allowed
to
warm
up
bit
before
tasting
mild
aroma
of
sweet
malt
and
a
hint
of
grassy
hops
typical
euro
pale
adjunct
lager
flavor
follows
with
mild
grainy
malt
with
a
hint
of
biscuit
and
a
light
grassy
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
light
bodied
quite
as
expected
for
a
light
foreign
lager
perhaps
with
slightly
more
mildly
astringent
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
than
the
body
can
support
but
overall
a
nice
neutral
accompaniment
to
my
thai
meal
even
if
not
something
i
would
buy
as
a
stand
alone
ale
o
this
could
be
a
guilty
pleasure
allnight
beer
with
friends
the
nose
isnt
good
but
the
rest
isnt
bad
it
pours
a
super
clear
light
yellow
with
a
small
white
head
and
vigorous
carbonation
theres
a
caro
syrup
smell
all
too
reminiscent
of
an
icehouse
lager
with
some
clean
pale
malts
and
a
hint
of
lemon
tasting
it
i
get
sweet
malt
bland
soggy
grains
and
as
it
warms
up
an
extremely
bitter
metallic
taste
on
the
back
end
its
no
wonder
they
served
this
in
a
frozen
pint
glass
goes
down
fizzy
with
a
watery
light
body
enjoy
overall
a
mild
but
pleasant
beer
it
reminded
me
of
a
budweiser
but
with
actual
flavor
and
not
watery
theres
a
nice
buttery
like
smoothness
to
this
beer
and
obviously
it
pairs
well
with
spicy
thai
food
the
next
time
im
at
a
thai
restaurant
i
might
have
to
get
a
bottle
or
two
with

the
style
fewer
flaws
as
well
although
there
is
a
little
metal
and
skunk
on
the
palate
great
with
spicy
curries
and
stir
fried
chilli
and
basil
chicken
and
has
more
character
than
its
countryman
chang
o
not
a
bad
beer
i
was
expecting
less
flavor
considering
the
lackluster
appearance
and
smell
much
better
than
a
lot
of
the
other
more
well
know
euro
pale
lagers
out
there
overall
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
but
was
pleasantly
surprised
especially
by
the
way
the
bubbles
tingle
in
mouth
and
on
the
tongue
beer
is
pretty
standard
otherwise
but
would
work
well
with
spicy
foods
in
particular
o
good
beer
to
relax
with
in
a
tropical
climate
i
love
this
beer
the
first
biggest
brewery
in
thailand
excellent
beer
no
other
beer
in
southeast
asia
comes
close
can
be
consumed
warm
or
ice
cold
prefer
ice
cold
heard
the
original
brewers
trained
under
the
guinness
brothers
and
modeled
this
beer
on
harp
only
difference
they
sourced
the
ingredients
locally
in
thailand
not
certain
that
is
true
but
the
beer
stands
out
and
i
buy
it
whenever
i
see
it
all
over
the
world
in
vietnam
where
i
live
i
gt
it

there
is

on

with
each

this
beer
has
a

this
was

than
pale
lager
went
down

quite
drinkable
i
had
this
easydrinking
lager
in
a
thai
restaurant
in
bonn
germany
beer
has
a
nice
color
but
the
foam
disappears
very
fast
its
very
drinkable
inviting
you
to
go
for
more
its
a
perfect
match
with
spicy
thai
food
and
i
would
recommend
it
in
such
an
occasion
but
otherwise
would
go
for
some
german
beer
overalli
like
this
beer
because
of
the
nostalgic
feelings
i
feel
from
traveling
through
thailand
it
is
just
your
standard
runofthemill
mass
produced
beers
sessionable
sure
o
ill
say
it
is
overall
average
in
that
you
will
likely
find
this
in
a
thai
restaurant
and
it
may
be
the
only
interesting
beer
option
for
that
it
works
but
beyond
that
it
is
nothing
special
boon
rawd
the
first
and
still
the
biggest
brewey
in
thailand
malty
lager
herby
and
golden
yellow
abv

they
brew
it
with
german
technology
builded
in

i
love
this
beer
but
it
is
more
expensive
than
other
beers
in
thailand
it
is
worth
the
extra
money
there
are
certainly
worse
lagers
out
there
in
fact
much
worse
this
beer
has
saved
me
many
times
while
out
eating
thai
food
as
it
was
by
far
the
best
beer
on
the
menu
it
makes
sense
for
such
a
purpose
as
well
a
fairly
crisp
lager
with
a
rounded
flavor
from
all
malt
and
a
snappy
finish
you
can
actually
taste
the
hops
really
not
that
bad
especially
for
a
euro
style
lager
that
being
said
i
wont
get
carried
away
either
it
still
is
a
eurolager
and
not
all
styles
should
be
treated
equally
some
are
catchall
categories
for
average
beer
this
one
pours
golden
with
a
moderate
white
head
that
settles
to
a
thin
swirl
smells
grainy
and
full
bodied
with
sweetness
on
the
finish
tastes
full
bodied
and
grainy
and
fairly
thick
but
with
a
nice
crisp
finish
while
overall
evincing
some
creaminess
it
is
what
it
is
but
better
than
most
in
the
style
not
something
i
would
ever
buy
back
home
but
overall
a
decent
asian
beer
that
gets
the
job
done
overall
i
liked
this
beer
especially
because
of
the
refreshing
quality
and
crisp
finish
and
flavor
this
turned
out
to
be
really
good
if
i
ever
go
to
thailand
i
know
which
beer
to
look
up
if
i
want
a
nice
thirst
quencher
o
pretty
good
thai
beer
to
match
with
the
thai
food
i
was
having
the
sweetness
of
the
beer
marries
nicely
with
the
spice
flavors
in
the
food
i
thought
the
beer
was
really
well
paired
with
the
food
but
not
sure
i
would
want
to
have
it
on
its
own
o
pleasing
to
drink
nothing
special
but
an
above
average
beer
from
a
bottle
stamped
fill070511exp
070512
sampled
on
february
25
2012
the
pour
is
pale
yellow
with
active
carbonation
and
a
small
shortlived
white
head
there
are
grains
and
malts
on
the
nose
but
little
else
but
that
is
about
average
for
the
style
thin
to
medium
body
the
taste
brings
out
the
malty
character
more
but
it
is
also
pretty
grainy
some
crisp
hops
fill
in
the
blanks
all
i
can
say
is
that
it
is
very
typical
of
the
style
o
surprisingly
good
beer
ill
admit
that
i
wasnt
expecting
much
but
it
overachieved
its
a
nice
simple
beer
but
wellcrafted
id
get
another
one
of
these
from
the
local
beer
store
and
knock
down
something
nice
and
salty
to
go
along
with
it
until
the
next
time
everyone
overall
very
average
often
the
best
choice
at
the
thai
restaurant
overall
a
pretty
decent
beer
would
be
a
great
thirst
quencher
with
some
thai
food
quite
an
average
tasting
thin
watery
but
refreshing
beer
o
theres
nothing
overly
special
about
this
beer
but
is
not
bad
considering
it
is
from
southeast
asia
and
would
probably
go
well
with
spicy
food
overall
poured
nicely
with
a
medium
head
which
receeded
quickly
very
light
taste
a
quick
finish
with
little
after
taste
a
light
malt
with
a
slight
sourness
to
a
light
dry
aftertaste
t
a
lot
of
sweet
malts
some
corn
and
a
pretty
decent
amount
of
grassy
hop
flavor
sure
there
are
better
beers
out
there
but
i
cant
think
of
much
that
goes
better
with
thai
food
mouth
easy
but
a
little
too
light
that
passes
for
a
bit
of
water
to
take
off
the
finish
is
slightly
dirty
and
a
touch
of
grain
is
not
important
faigt
felt
well
that
business
remains
strong
so
no
real
surprise
o
euro
pale
lager
what
can
i
say
but
are
these
ever
really
interesting
yet
i
probably
would
still
have
it
again
feels
smooth
in
mouth
with
some
lively
carbonation
on
the
tongue
probably
my
favorite
asian
style
way
better
then
other
malts
such
as
kirin
or
tsingtao
went
well
with
the
pad
thai
overall
i
was
surprised
by
this
beer
i
like
it
a
lot
o
i
was
forced
to
drink
this
several
years
ago
on
a
thai
airways
flight
from
cans
suffice
to
say
it
was
probably
the
worst
beer
i
think
id
ever
drank
so
for
this
review
i
used
the
bottled
version
so
my
verdict
would
be
that
its
better
than
out
of
a
can
definitely
not
as
horrid
as
i
remember
but
scarcely
worth
a
mention
o
no
rice
here
this
is
quality
barley
beer
and
a
perfect
finish
to
a
long
hot
day
under
the
blistering
sun
i
personally
prefer
a
few
of
the
smoother
lagers
w
the
hint
of
sweetness
that
lingers
just
a
bit
but
theres
no
denying
this
is
superior
se
asian
brew
that
also
holds
its
own
outside
of
the
region
o
not
the
worst
lager
you
can
get
by
any
means
but
thats
not
saying
a
lot
really
my
first
thai
beer
the
alcohol
is
hidden
well
the
pour
looks
like
your
standard
american
lager
the
head
retains
well
throughout
the
session
leaving
decent
lacing
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
smell
is
barley
and
rice
taste
is
pretty
good
with
the
6
being
hidden
well
there
is
no
alcohol
burn
here
overall
ill
have
this
again
and
again
part
of
a
mix
your
six
pack
at
friar
tuck
beverage
o
while
its
good
to
try
new
things
i
find
it
kind
of
irritating
that
beers
from
exotic
countries
like
thailand
arent
more
exotic
themselves
still
a
decent
enough
beer
rjt
one
of
domestic
footballs
most
advertised
beers
one
can
see
why
it
is
easily
marketable
as
well
as
distributed
refreshing
to
say
the
least
or
perhaps
most
o
introduced
to
this
by
a
friend
and
it
was
better
than
i
had
imagined
very
drinkable
with
good
flavor
for
such
a
light
lager
will
be
entering
my
future
rotation
4
i
am
not
a
lager
drinker
by
any
means
but
i
am
thoroughly
impressed
with
singha
i
believe
this
beer
to
be
perfect
on
a
hot
day
and
one
that
is
extremely
sessionable
medium
to
light
golden
in
appearance
this
lager
is
darker
than
most
american
style
lagers
pour
is
as
you
would
expect
with
a
good
12
finger
head
lacing
is
minimal
but
apparent
taste
is
of
slight
peach
and
honey
mouth
feel
is
lightmedium
possibly
due
to
the
amount
of
barley
used
in
this
brew
a
slight
sodiumdry
finish
is
felt
at
the
back
all
in
all
this
has
become
one
of
my
favorite
lagers
which
is
a
short
list
this
matches
perfectly
with
thai
food
and
coconut
curry
try
this
one
fresh
for
the
best
results
you
will
not
be
disappointed
cheers
i
like
it
i
would
totally
try
this
beer
again
actually
i
might
go
order
another
one
bottoms
up
people
overall
i
dont
know
what
it
is
but
no
matter
what
country
they
are
from
in
asia
all
beers
of
this
style
taste
so
similar
this
one
is
a
bit
better
that
other
ive
had
though
but
its
nothing
id
ever
buy
regularly
im
just
sitting
at
the
bar
waiting
for
my
togo
thai
food
and
decided
to
have
and
review
their
thai
beer
o
overall
this
isnt
that
bad
of
a
beer
alot
better
than
i
expected
to
get
at
a
thai
restaurant
would
order
this
again
to
go
along
with
some
thai
curry
overall
perfect
for
an
end
of
the
week
smooth
summer
savoring
its
a
really
good
lager
crisp
and
smooth
overall
nice
beer
although
it
could
use
a
stronger
hop
presence
worthy
a
try
o
on
its
own
not
all
that
great
but
when
in
rome
thailand
do
as
the
romans
thai
do
the
lager
cut
through
the
fatty
sweet
coconut
milk
of
the
curry
and
cooled
the
spices
adequately
i
wouldnt
get
it
outside
of
this
environment
but
id
probably
get
it
there
again
i
like
thai
food
this
is
a
good
beer
to
be
from
thailand
easy
to
drink
and
goes
well
with
the
curry
satay
peanut
sauces
and
other
flavors
of
its
country
not
a
knock
it
out
of
the
park
beer
but
like
other
beers
that
go
great
with
bbq
and
hot
food
this
one
will
do
just
that
and
not
knock
you
down
o
not
a
bad
goto
lager
probably
wont
go
after
this
again
even
though
its
texture
lends
itself
beautifully
to
summer
drinking
light
and
effervescent
it
is
certainly
refreshing
though
i
would
likely
just
opt
for
a
glass
of
water
instead
this
is
a
surprise
from
southeast
asia
its
got
this
citrusy
sweetness
to
it
that
was
totally
unxpected
i
have
to
admit
im
somewhat
impressed
by
this
euro
lager
the
head
is
fluffy
and
retains
well
the
nose
is
subdued
but
contains
dry
powdery
grain
aromas
the
flavor
is
mellow
on
the
hop
side
but
its
quite
sweet
and
pleasant
for
a
lager
very
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
beer
as
lagers
go
this
was
up
there
i
would
not
hesitate
to
get
this
beer
again
this
beer
pours
a
pale
golden
straw
color
large
soda
sized
carbonation
bubbles
rise
up
to
a
fat
fingers
worth
of
pure
white
head
the
head
falls
rather
fast
to
a
skim
coating
that
hardly
leaves
any
lacing
i
smell
some
grass
worcestershire
and
a
faint
light
whiff
of
skunk
it
smells
like
a
lager
maybe
a
european
lager
not
a
good
one
though
doesnt
taste
bad
but
its
far
from
great
it
is
herbal
and
grassy
light
body
light
carbonation
it
feels
like
it
leaves
a
film
behind
i
dont
like
this
beer
o
not
sure
what
i
really
expected
but
this
was
not
something
that
i
would
care
to
drink
again
bland
but
refreshing
the
best
aspect
of
this
beer
is
that
the
flavour
is
clean
no
unpleasant
off
notes
otherwise
its
a
runofthemill
lager
nice
on
a
hot
day
o
not
bad
but
definitely
not
worth
picking
up
while
its
refreshing
its
certainly
not
as
refreshing
as
the
constant
ads
for
it
on
the
back
of
all
about
beer
make
it
out
to
be
not
that
i
was
expecting
it
in
the
least
average
anyway
drinkability
the
flavor
isnt
great
but
paired
with
savory
spicy
east
asian
or
indian
food
this
beer
might
just
be
spoton
its
got
its
flaws
certainly
but
its
a
relatively
quenching
beer
that
i
dont
hate
make
of
that
what
you
will
this
beer
pours
out
as
a
clear
pale
yellow
brew
with
a
white
head
on
it
that
fades
within
a
few
minutes
the
aromas
coming
from
this
beer
are
mostly
grains
and
some
funk
the
taste
is
pretty
mild
with
malts
and
some
hops
in
the
mix
the
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
dry
overall
its
pretty
boring
to
say
the
least
i
wouldnt
run
out
of
my
way
to
have
this
one
again
choctee
beertracker
it
poured
a
very
bright
gold
the
perfect
colour
to
describe
as
gold
it
wasnt
yellow
and
it
wasnt
pale
it
was
gold
it
also
had
no
head
none
to
start
with
whatsoever
it
had
a
unique
smell
that
was
hard
to
place
a
slight
sweetness
that
was
maybe
vaguely
fruity
like
a
pear
something
else
was
present
that
i
couldnt
quite
place
sort
earthy
the
taste
was
unique
tasted
vaguely
of
unhopped
malt
with
no
corn
which
was
a
refreshing
difference
from
american
cheapo
beers
it
was
a
bit
sweet
but
once
again
not
in
a
corny
way
its
definitely
a
very
watery
beer
but
also
very
refreshing
this
is
something
i
could
see
myself
craving
on
a
hot
day
more
so
than
busch
or
even
sol
this
is
tres
smooth
well
designed
for
the
tropics
of
thailand
it
went
well
with
the
very
spicy
szechuan
sauce
i
put
on
my
rice
too
this
is
clearly
a
cheaplymade
beer
but
damn
its
refreshing
o
not
a
terrible
example
of
the
style
i
found
it
too
sweet
and
too
carbonated
to
be
anything
resembling
a
regular
purchase
but
it
goes
down
easily
enough
pours
light
yellow
with
a
thin
white
head
that
faded
fast
no
major
aroma
comes
out
from
this
beer
other
than
some
sweet
and
yeastgrain
notes
taste
is
thin
sweeter
than
expected
with
a
subtle
mix
of
flavor
the
mouthfeel
was
light
somewhat
smooth
with
nice
carbonation
i
had
this
with
thai
food
and
it
worked
well
with
the
strong
thai
flavors
as
a
palette
cleanser
but
not
a
lot
of
flavor
coming
out
of
this
beer
as
thai
citizen
this
is
my
number
one
thai
beer
if
u
have
a
chance
i
recommend
this
one
with
thai
food
believe
that
singha
will
not
disappointed
u
i
only
tasted
this
beer
because
my
wife
had
a
large
bottle
with
her
sushi
but
id
much
rather
have
a
german
pilsner
with
real
beer
ingredients
this
is
a
mass
produced
beer
made
with
adjuncts
from
thailand
and
i
could
not
find
anything
in
taste
or
smell
that
would
make
me
seek
it
out
or
purchase
it
again
d
clearly
one
of
the
better
euro
pales
out
there
id
put
this
up
with
classic
pilsners
a
great
match
for
thai
food
id
imagine
overallwhile
this
had
more
hype
i
actually
thought
chang
was
better
simply
not
a
great
beer
even
for
a
style
where
being
an
import
and
inoffensive
usually
gets
you
great
hype
containing
astonishing
refreshing
ability
high
drinkable
beer
that
is
well
fit
with
spicy
thai
cuisine
taste
is
enjoyable
and
there
is
more
of
it
than
with
a
typical
american
counterpart
think
of
this
as
a
beer
that
lovers
of
this
style
can
enjoy
i
will
seek
this
one
out
if
i
ever
dine
at
a
thai
restaurant
clear
golden
pour
with
a
frothy
white
head
that
doesnt
last
long
slightly
sweet
aroma
is
mainly
of
malt
but
there
are
some
grassy
hops
as
well
flavour
is
the
same
as
aroma
with
added
lemon
and
corn
notes
light
dry
mouthfeel
with
high
carbonation
and
some
mild
bitterness
on
the
finish
pretty
bland
lager
but
drinkable
d
this
is
pretty
basic
stuff
its
certainly
inoffensive
and
goes
down
easy
d
fine
easy
going
down
and
relatively
light
light
bodied
with
a
decent
balance
of
pale
malt
and
crisp
slightly
bitter
hops
the
hops
are
faint
but
add
a
little
bit
of
flavor
that
is
usually
missing
in
these
beers
slight
grass
and
straw
notes
but
unfortunately
the
grainy
notes
from
the
aroma
are
very
apparent
lots
of
corn
and
rice
but
overall
this
beer
isnt
terrible
cogan
brought
this
to
a
thai
restaurant
and
they
were
a
nice
compliment
to
the
spicy
food
d
nothing
is
wrong
with
the
beer
average
all
around
standard
lager
flavors
maybe
a
bit
more
bitter
than
some
light
golden
with
a
bleached
white
head
with
decent
retention
tons
of
carbonation
aroma
is
sweet
with
fruit
notes
none
of
the
grassy
characteristics
one
would
expect
from
a
lager
in
this
respect
it
is
more
ale
like
lots
of
carbonation
perhaps
too
much
even
for
the
style
cooked
vegetables
in
the
middle
followed
by
an
uninteresting
bitter
finish
light
bodied
dry
finish
drinkability
overall
a
dull
lager
with
little
to
no
refreshing
quality
d
very
easy
to
drink
and
very
quaffable
with
a
pretty
ok
flavor
not
bad
on
the
whole
3
5
d
my
first
thailand
beer
not
bad
why
too
sweet
for
my
taste
but
worth
looking
into
if
you
want
to
try
tai
beer
httpabarwithnoname
wordpress
com
pour
into
a
pint
glass
very
clear
golden
yellow
with
very
little
foam
that
is
gone
within
a
min
very
little
carbonation
no
lattice
to
speak
of
smell
of
grass
slight
bitter
taste
with
a
some
what
smooth
finish
not
a
great
beer
but
not
horrible
the
drink
on
this
very
is
very
high
this
could
be
a
great
session
beer
i
am
very
impressed
firstly
because
i
am
not
always
a
lager
drinker
secondly
because
this
is
the
first
thai
beer
i
have
ever
had
its
a
nice
refreshing
brew
i
will
most
certainly
find
this
one
again
d
this
is
one
of
those
examples
of
a
beer
with
nothing
serioiusly
wrong
about
any
one
ingredient
but
as
a
whole
just
didnt
go
together
well
this
is
one
tasty
macro
lager
its
very
easy
to
drink
and
would
be
great
on
a
hot
summer
day
overall
i
was
a
little
disappointed
in
this
beer
after
reading
some
good
reviews
its
a
standard
euro
pale
lager
nothing
special
about
it
it
is
at
least
all
malt
which
is
a
plus
but
everyone
of
my
friends
who
tried
it
said
it
tasted
like
pbr
i
did
enjoy
it
with
my
thai
food
and
will
probably
drink
it
again
with
thai
food
but
definitely
not
any
other
time
drinkability
id
pass
on
this
one
but
if
you
normally
like
sake
or
other
asianbrewed
beers
this
might
be
a
winner
in
your
book
it
certainly
isnt
in
mine
not
pleasant
bleh
taste
somewhat
refreshing
if
only
because
there
isnt
much
there
to
pick
up
on
other
than
water
and
the
slightest
hop
presence
nothing
real
offensive
going
on
here
other
than
the
price
for
this
didnt
try
it
with
spicy
food
but
i
imagine
it
would
be
ok
theres
just
not
a
lot
to
this
beer
and
yet
the
price
is
as
if
there
was
overall
i
found
the
beer
to
be
just
fair
or
average
rather
easy
to
drink
nothing
unpleasant
or
exiting
coming
in
brown
glass
at
least
theres
a
chance
this
beer
wont
be
skunked
on
you
pours
fairly
standard
look
and
color
and
smell
for
cheap
american
pilsners
taste
actually
wasnt
bad
a
fairly
balanced
malt
and
hops
and
sweetness
id
take
this
over
sapporo
or
tsintao
serving
type
can
d
delicious
paired
with
some
spicy
pho
golden
body
above
average
carbonation
rising
from
bottom
of
wine
glass
quite
thin
layer
of
white
head
quick
dissipation
with
o
k
lacing
sweet
malts
or
adjuncts
dominate
the
nose
little
hop
presence
the
taste
is
once
again
quite
sweet
hops
not
noticeable
average
mouthfeel
not
bad
effervescence
while
i
wont
hesitate
to
order
one
of
these
with
lunch
at
beervanas
favorite
thai
restaurant
this
isnt
something
ill
drink
at
home
again
the
malt
flavor
and
the
stellar
crispness
does
what
not
many
lagers
can
it
harnesses
an
epic
refreshing
quality
and
maximizes
drinkability
you
dont
have
to
be
eating
in
a
thai
restaurant
to
drink
this
beer
its
good
enough
to
stand
on
its
own
overall
i
have
had
worse
but
it
certainly
was
not
worth
me
tracking
down
at
all
pours
a
deep
golden
color
high
carbonation
but
the
head
fizzles
out
pretty
fast
i
was
disappointed
in
the
aroma
and
taste
thought
it
was
surprisingly
skunky
and
harsh
had
maybe
a
bit
of
sweet
rice
flavor
but
the
overall
feel
was
a
letdown
especially
for
the
price
not
drinkable
for
me
i
wasnt
eager
to
finish
the
bottle
id
drink
one
if
i
was
given
one
but
wouldnt
order
it
again
the
fact
that
most
beers
certainly
the
most
common
and
nearly
all
massproduced
ones
resemble
this
watery
cheap
corn
syrup
is
probably
why
most
people
have
to
acquire
the
taste
for
beer
and
why
many
never
bother
to
ill
admit
that
it
took
me
some
time
to
stomach
lagers
like
this
with
comfort
and
by
the
time
i
could
i
had
already
realized
there
were
much
better
much
more
exciting
and
enjoyable
offerings
out
there
d
rink
not
a
beer
id
have
again
better
off
drinking
tsingtao
id
only
drink
this
again
if
i
was
in
thailand
okay
maybe
here
if
in
a
thai
restaurant
perhaps
a
safe
alternative
to
the
jungle
water
but
other
then
that
i
wouldnt
go
looking
for
this
one
carbonation
is
pretty
high
but
at
least
this
dries
out
the
sweet
malt
well
d
it
goes
easy
a
summer
beer
nothing
special
apart
the
characteristic
perfume
notes
overall
a
decent
euro
lager
but
there
are
better
ones
out
there
for
the
same
money
i
think
this
beer
is
somewhat
overpriced
it
isnt
as
good
as
the
cost
would
indicate
it
definitely
was
crisp
and
i
am
looking
forward
to
a
tasty
spicy
meal
to
complement
it
rather
aone
dimensional
beer
it
wouldnt
be
bad
if
it
hadnt
that
unpleasant
kind
of
smell
and
taste
in
the
background
drinkability
is
very
good
nothing
too
exciting
but
its
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
overall
decent
for
what
it
is
and
considerably
better
than
some
well
known
european
pale
lagers
may
not
buy
it
again
soon
unless
im
at
a
thai
resturant
but
if
i
was
offered
this
by
someone
i
would
certainly
accept
it
i
can
see
this
being
effective
for
cooling
down
after
spicy
food
d
nothing
objectionable
here
a
refreshing
beer
especially
after
a
day
trekking
through
the
sticky
heat
of
thailand
good
finger
of
pure
white
dimpled
foam
holds
steady
for
a
decent
while
before
breaking
across
the
surface
thin
rivulets
of
lacing
cling
here
and
there
orange
to
dark
gold
color
consistent
throughout
transparent
but
not
watery
very
few
bubbles
to
be
seen
beery
nose
of
barley
lentils
lemon
peel
metallic
rust
honeyed
malts
and
cane
sugar
can
be
slightly
offputting
at
times
lightbodied
with
a
weak
handshake
tries
to
slip
the
churning
carbonation
in
there
swiftly
to
create
presence
and
distract
from
the
presence
of
diverse
flavors
honey
corn
syrup
malted
milk
balls
rice
mask
a
good
deal
of
the
more
bitter
hops
and
grassiness
undistinguished
florality
fills
in
some
blanks
through
the
finish
no
real
glaring
flaws
but
pretty
gosh
darn
boring
pours
a
light
yellow
color
nice
carbonation
small
white

with
some
sticky

the

the
taste

slightly
sweet
malty
slight

note
light
body
not
drinkable
would
not
buy
again
lives
up
to
its
style
by
pouring
a
very
pale
straw
like
urine
when
a
lot
of
water
has
been
drunk
the
initially
strong
white
frothy
head
dissipates
rather
quickly
though
stoically
into
nothingness
the
nose
is
faint
notes
of
caramel
wheat
and
grasses
with
a
light
syrupy
sweetness
riding
cavalier
through
it
all
the
taste
brings
these
elements
together
toning
down
the
sweetness
a
bit
and
ratcheting
up
a
bland
grassiness
the
body
is
definitely
on
the
lighter
side
with
active
enough
carbonation
and
a
smooth
but
watery
texture
overall
not
that
bad
a
brew
but
definitely
nothing
to
write
home
from
bangkok
about
d
easy
going
beer
but
very
plain
and
simple
not
something
i
would
drink
for
its
own
sake
it
did
compliment
my
meal
perfectly
i
approached
this
beer
with
very
low
expectations
and
it
was
actually
a
little
better
than
i
thought
it
did
have
its
off
flavors
and
unpleasantries
but
otherwise
wasnt
too
bad
more
flavor
than
i
expected
thankfully
the
taste
is
not
overly
metallic
the
grains
are
slightly
husky
sweet
and
biscuity
light
hopping
but
you
can
tell
it
is
there
on
the
finish
this
drinks
like
a
malt
liquor
more
than
a
euro
pale
lager
not
bad
and
goes
well
with
thai
food
although
a
bit
pricey
at
a
restaurant
one
of
the
better
epls
i
have
had
it
has
great
mouthfeel
and
you
can
feel
the
carbonation
the
taste
is
nothing
special
but
it
is
easy
to
drink
and
goes
well
with
food
i
enjoy
it
more
than
the
average
beer
and
have
bought
a
6pack
to
enjoy
at
home
12
oz
brown
bottle
to
glass
light
golden
yellow
head
fades
to
almost
nothing
fairly
typical
lager
smell
maybe
a
bit
sweeter
tastes
sweet
as
well
and
a
bit
of
alcohol
comes
through
at
times
but
not
objectionable
maybe
a
tad
bigger
overall
flavor
than
the
sapporo
i
tried
recently
i
drank
this
in
a
matter
of
a
few
minutes
so
goes
down
easy
but
overall
a
fairly
middle
of
the
road
beer
appearance
has
a
light
golden
yellow
color
with
a
thin
crisp
head
smell
is
grainy
and
hoppy
taste
is
a
little
grainy
with
a
sour
note
in
the
back
giving
way
to
a
little
dryness
mouthfeel
is
of
course
light
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
overall
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
that
good
either
that
id
buy
another
nothing
beats
a
draft
singha
during
happy
hour
in
phuket
gret
with
just
about
any
thai
dish
or
seafood
also
tried
the
cans
and
bottles
and
they
were
equally
as
good
nice
pale
golden
appearance
this
lager
has
a
typical
german
style
taste
and
seemed
pretty
consistent
from
can
to
draft
to
bottle
the
smell
is
typical
lager
and
it
can
definitely
be
a
session
beer
had
no
problem
downing
23
on
a
humid
phuket
afternoon
d
not
crisp
enough
to
suite
me
bitterness
boring
hop
character
underwhelming
this
could
have
been
due
to
the
bottle
being
a
bit
past
its
prime
but
this
is
what
the
beer
has
always
tasted
like
to
me
it
has
a
very
medium
presence
in
my
mouth
it
was
light
and
heavy
without
being
to
much
of
either
it
had
a
very
crisp
taste
and
a
smooth
style
that
made
its
drinkability
exceptional
i
dont
think
id
have
this
a
third
time
but
i
bet
it
would
go
decent
with
some
asian
food
i
doubt
i
would
turn
this
down
if
offered
it
for
free
if
that
helps
m
this
beer
has
a
light
airy
mouthfeel
with
a
tight
fizz
finish
d
the
light
and
crisp
beer
has
a
nice
soft
sweetness
to
it
that
the
sulfur
flavors
are
muted
there
is
not
much
flavor
there
but
what
is
there
is
pleasant
singha
is
a
tasty
lager
well
above
the
bmc
class
i
believe
this
to
be
the
best
euro
pale
lager
i
have
had
its
an
easy
to
drink
beer
pleasant
enough
though
slightly
forgettable
after
the
fact
while
hardly
something
id
want
to
drink
much
of
on
its
own
this
always
goes
down
well
enough
with
spicy
east
asian
fare
go
figure
the
brown
bottle
belies
the
skank
factor
inherent
in
this
one
which
can
only
point
to
a
cheaplymade
brew
in
the
first
place
hello
country
tick
overall
this
beer
wasnt
bad
on
its
own
it
is
drinkable
but
could
shine
with
the
proper
accompanying
dishes
quite
refreshing
on
a
warm
day
and
has
some
nice
thirst
quenching
qualities
pours
a
light
pale
straw
goldenrod
sunlight
on
a
sunday
morning
color
no
head
to
speak
of
very
fizzy
smell
is
pretty
bland
a
little
rank
pungent
slightly
malty
and
tinny
taste
is
bland
boring
watery
thin
unrefined
skunked
mouthfeel
is
small
and
unsubstantial
drinkability
is
low
because
it
just
feels
so
wrong
to
drink
this
singha
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
singha
glass
little
to
know
head
steady
carbonation
no
lacing
yellow
and
clear
the
beer
has
almost
no
aroma
and
it
feels
average
in
the
mouth
this
is
a
decent
example
of
an
asian
lager
but
there
isnt
really
anything
sepcial
about
it
kind
of
an
average
beer
i
drink
it
when
i
need
to
cleanse
my
pallet
if
you
like
tiger
or
tsintao
you
may
enjoy
this
it
isnt
as
dry
as
those
others
its
just
an
average
beer
had
to
fill
the
mix
a
six
up
so
went
with
some
mass
produced
imported
beers
pours
a
very
light
golden
color
with
a
nice
head
but
it
quickly
goes
down
to
nothing
has
the
skunkiness
of
a
german
beer
ala
becks
or
st
pauli
girl
kind
of
a
biting
aftertaste
to
it
but
taste
wise
and
body
wise
its
better
than
most
of
the
other
imports
ive
tried
good
if
you
want
to
try
a
beer
from
thailand
but
thats
the
only
reason
i
would
get
it
just
a
run
of
the
mill
import
with
little
no
flavor
or
care
in
the
beer
drinkability
ive
tried
to
drink
more
than
a
few
at
a
time
and
just
couldnt
heartburn
set
in
and
got
all
bloaty
oh
well
from
a
brown
11
2
oz
bottle
has
a
pale
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
mild
a
tad
skunky
taste
is
also
mild
crisp
with
some
hoppiness
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
has
good
drinkability
not
as
good
as
i
remembered
it
on
my
travels
in
thailand
overall
a
pretty
average
beer
not
a
bad
import
lager
tastes
like
a
lot
of
other
asian
breweries
lagers
but
not
quite
as
sweet
nothing
special
though
d
i
will
say
that
it
was
a
refreshing
break
from
the
spicy
thai
food
i
was
eating
but
was
a
bit
too
flavorless
to
hold
its
own
without
food
to
accompany
it
from
the
can
into
a
pilsner
glass
golden
light
yellow
with
a
thin
head
smell
is
very
lagery
i
mean
just
plain
malty
with
a
little
lemony
hint
if
you
imagine
tastes
plain
with
a
bitter
alternate
feels
very
watery
on
the
palate
very
drinkable
when
served
ice
cold
singha
is
the
pride
of
asia
d
well
im
rather
surprized
i
thought
a
beer
from
south
east
of
asia
was
rather
easy
to
dismiss
but
no
this
must
be
one
of
the
best
beers
from
that
region
this
beer
pours
a
clear
golden
straw
color
the
head
is
a
quarter
inch
in
height
and
recedes
quickly
into
minimal
lacing
the
aroma
almost
entirely
consists
of
nothing
there
is
an
extremely
faint
hint
of
malt
but
that
is
it
it
isnt
a
bad
aroma
it
just
isnt
an
aroma
the
taste
is
more
of
the
same
there
is
a
little
more
malt
but
mostly
it
taste
like
carbonated
water
the
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
annoyingly
high
carbonation
overall
this
beer
is
a
bore
and
i
cant
think
of
much
else
to
say
had
my
first
thai
food
experience
and
i
wanted
to
have
a
thai
beer
to
go
with
it
this
was
the
only
thai
beer
the
restaurant
had
and
while
it
is
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
its
just
a
very
typical
lager
i
could
have
easily
ordered
a
budweiser
and
had
the
same
experience
because
of
that
there
is
not
much
to
say
other
than
this
beer
was
slightly
sweeter
than
most
aals
poured
into
pint
glass
which
produced
a
delicate
head
that
quickly
faded
to
half
a
finger
smell
is
of
cereal
malts
but
hints
of
doughy
sweetness
have
a
strange
and
inviting
quality
no
real
hop
aroma
taste
is
of
sweet
toasted
malts
with
a
hint
of
bitterness
and
no
real
hop
flavor
quite
surprised
by
the
amount
of
flavor
for
a
macro
mouthfeel
is
thin
but
not
bad
a
slight
oiliness
is
present
overall
really
not
too
bad
i
have
a
feeling
that
a
fresher
sample
would
be
quite
nice
with
spicy
foods
makes
you
wish
some
american
macro
lagers
were
this
drinkable
drinkability
wouldnt
usually
drink
it
but
will
occasionally
at
the
thai
restaurant
pretty
interesting
for
a
thai
beer
the
best
of
the
east
asian
lagers
drinkability
just
too
sweet
unbalanced
this
is
a
lighter
beer
with
a
pretty
nice
fluffy
white
head
considering
the
style
some
stale
malt
characteristics
in
the
nose
bring
the
adjunct
lager
to
the
forefront
somewhat
sweet
with
a
touch
of
green
citrus
taste
is
light
mostly
light
malt
and
hay
still
it
could
be
refreshing
after
a
hot
summer
day
with
a
semicrisp
finish
i
dont
know
that
ive
ever
had
beer
from
thailand
before
i
wasnt
expecting
this
to
be
good
beer
but
its
flat
out
bad
i
hope
some
folks
over
there
can
brew
something
better
than
this
but
id
believe
that
this
is
as
good
as
it
gets
thailand
doesnt
come
to
mind
as
a
land
of
brewing
trailblazers
this
one
needs
to
go
back
to
the
drawing
board
it
needs
a
ton
of
work
cant
recommend
this
one
i
think
this
would
be
very
refreshing
and
drinkable
alone
on
a
really
hot
day
this
would
have
to
be
ice
cold
of
course
drinkability
is
fine
what
can
i
say
im
happy
i
had
a
beer
with
my
dinner
singha
is
nothing
necessarily
remarkable
but
yes
it
is
definitely
drinkable
d
i
gave
it
a
5
0
on
drinkability
this
beer
isnt
the
sum
of
its
parts
it
tastes
great
the
mouthfeel
is
really
good
too
and
its
so
easily
drinkable
with
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
pleasing
flavors
and
bite
to
keep
you
coming
back
for
more
drinkability
this
is
one
of
the
better
options
available
in
most
bars
in
thailand
although
there
are
far
superior
options
available
back
in
the
u
s
i
am
ok
having
a
few
of
these
with
some
spicy
pad
thai
or
tom
yum
singha
has
a
pale
golden
straw
color
there
were
many
tiny
bubbles
and
head
was
non
existant
nice
artwork
on
the
label
it
had
a
nice
hoppy
aroma
though
the
smell
was
somewhat
faint
this
beer
has
a
nice
crisp
taste
it
is
a
bit
sweet
with
hints
of
barley
and
wheat
you
can
defiantely
taste
the
happy
hops
the
brew
tingles
your
tounge
on
contact
and
goes
down
very
smooth
i
find
this
beer
very
drinkable
i
first
encountred
this
brew
in
hawaii
but
while
in
thailand
this
beer
was
not
consumed
as
much
as
chang
mainly
due
to
price
had
tonite
with
thai
food
poured
a
nice
straw
yellow
color
with
bright
white
foam
head
smelled
of
malt
and
a
little
citrus
what
a
nice
clean
crisp
taste
full
malt
and
grain
flavor
with
a
good
amount
of
sweetness
obviously
matches
great
with
thai
food
or
other
spicy
cuisine
has
a
hint
of
a
citrus
taste
with
a
that
clean
malt
flavor
you
expect
from
the
category
very
very
drinkible
these
will
be
good
to
keep
in
the
fridge
for
those
doubleheader
baseball
sessions
at
home
in
front
of
the
tv
drinkability
highly
highly
drinkable
a
great
session
lager
i
have
to
say
i
am
sometimes
hard
on
the
lager
style
as
i
prefer
ales
but
this
one
is
good
i
find
something
very
unique
and
refreshing
in
this
one
im
glad
i
found
this
one
and
i
think
its
one
i
will
be
revisiting
simply
put
this
beer
is
not
a
good
beer
it
was
not
at
all
easy
to
drink
this
along
with
my
sushi
drinking
this
added
another
country
onto
my
reviewing
profile
thailand
is
my
50th
now
visited
on
here
this
beer
may
be
best
consumed
as
an
accompaniment
to
somethng
spicy
where
its
service
is
as
a
coolant
had
this
lager
all
over
thailand
it
is
the
beer
over
there
but
substandard
here
poured
like
a
bud
light
yellow
no
head
not
even
fizzy
no
nose
and
no
body
cheap
malts
and
this
beer
is
really
not
worth
a
review
very
grainy
and
lacks
hops
lots
of
asjunct
here
and
pretty
poor
on
taste
and
drinkability
oh
btw
i
had
this
beer
in
thailand
from
a
can
and
it
was
pretty
much
exactly
the
same
when
i
saw
it
back
here
us
i
wanted
to
try
it
again
and
see
if
it
was
the
same
beer
it
definitely
is
took
me
back
to
thailand
again
d
easy
to
drink
id
have
another
good
pairing
with
asian
food
like
pad
thai
overall
ive
read
that
this
is
actually
an
allmalt
beer
comparing
it
to
many
of
the
adjunct
beers
on
the
market
is
a
little
unfair
singha
beats
many
of
these
quite
easily
against
other
allmalt
options
it
would
be
a
much
closer
race
drinkability
itll
do
singha
delivers
a
bit
more
character
than
expected
certainly
more
than
rest
of
the
endless
parade
of
sad
vapid
lagers
out
their
pours
clear
gold
with
a
medium
white
head
lagery
metallic
aroma
taste
was
more
of
the
same
yet
sweeter
and
less
corny
more
of
a
rice
flavor
i
had
this
beer
at
pf
changs
it
tasted
good
with
the
dan
dan
noodles
but
when
i
see
it
sitting
there
on
the
shelf
at
bevmo
i
know
it
will
never
make
it
into
my
fridge
this
really
does
have
its
place
amoung
restuarants
of
the
asian
variety
taste
the
alcohol
comes
through
a
little
bit
this
might
just
replace
sapporo
as
my
favorite
asian
lager
this
is
basically
clean
inoffensive
and
drinkable
lager
it
certainly
doesnt
taste
like
an
american
macro
it
reminds
me
more
of
a
bland
munich
helles
lager
theres
a
very
light
bready
malt
note
with
tinge
of
hops
at
the
end
very
drinkable
no
brewing
flaws
not
a
lot
of
flavor
but
id
never
turn
a
free
one
down
give
me
anothery
pours
a
white
head
but
is
moderately
quickly
diminishing
body
is
very
light
yellow
in
color
not
much
aromaslightly
sweet
malty
has
a
bland
flavor
and
some
malty
aftertaste
slightly
fizzy
palate
id
definately
have
some
more
of
this
interesting
asian
macro
lager
d
overall
not
impressed
drinkability
wise
a
pass
and
basically
a
mindless
drink
light
body
with
lots
of
carbonation
not
terrible
if
cold
d
keeping
in
mind
the
style
this
is
a
very
good
beer
its
my
first
asian
beer
but
when
comparing
with
any
of
the
american
and
mexican
macros
and
even
a
lot
of
the
europeans
this
is
top
class
i
dont
know
if
id
call
it
a
session
beer
but
definitely
a
great
beer
to
go
along
with
a
pizza
burger
or
some
other
food
this
might
become
a
new
tailgating
beer
for
me
smell
is
of
malts
sort
of
sweet
smelling
sort
of
subdued
taste
subtle
as
well
not
bad
actually
quite
palatable
for
this
style
decent
mouth
feel
bubbles
have
a
club
soda
feeling
and
finish
rather
smoothly
with
little
after
taste
id
drink
this
again
but
i
think
it
would
have
to
be
with
a
nice
spicy
thai
meal
a
classic
sampled
on
tap
at
of
course
a
thai
restaurant
in
southern
vermont
poured
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
pillowy
white
head
two
fingers
thick
moderate
retention
and
good
lacing
aromas
of
yeast
hops
and
some
sweet
malts
the
flavors
are
very
typical
of
an
asiatic
lager
sweetbread
malts
general
grains
as
per
a
macro
brewery
and
a
bright
hop
finish
very
crisp
balanced
but
lacking
depth
making
it
a
good
food
beer
medium
carbonation
and
light
body
beautifully
counterpoints
spicy
food
especially
something
with
a
little
sweetness
like
thai
or
chipotle
sauce
easy
to
drink
this
beer
is
my
asian
lager
of
choice
it
goes
very
well
with
thai
food
spicy
or
otherwise
well
i
can
now
say
ive
tried
the
original
thai
beer
that
and
i
can
cross
off
another
country
in
which
ive
tried
a
beer
as
for
the
beer
its
pretty
bad
looks
and
tastes
like
cheap
swill
golden
colored
not
much
head
or
lacing
some
sweet
malts
but
mainly
its
got
a
skunky
corn
grainy
taste
going
down
its
bearable
but
the
aftertaste
is
terrible
this
beer
isnt
bad
just
not
good
a
little
watered
down
pours
a
light
straw
color
with
a
bubbly
white
head
that
hung
around
for
a
while
leaving
no
lacing
the
smell
is
fairly
skunky
with
everything
youd
expect
in
a
macro
lager
light
malts
and
some
grain
the
taste
was
slighter
better
for
me
with
a
slight
sweetness
on
top
of
the
typical
grain
and
malt
macro
taste
mouthfeel
was
light
and
fairly
thin
this
one
actually
wasnt
too
bad
with
my
thai
meal
and
drinkability
was
pretty
good
not
sure
if
id
order
it
again
though
d
it
is
not
undrinkable
but
it
isnt
the
smoothest
beer
to
drink
this
is
hot
day
knock
em
down
beer
worked
well
with
the
thai
food
i
was
eating
but
wouldnt
buy
a
6
pack
of
this
stuff
this
one
isnt
anything
special
clear
yellow
little
head
mild
scentflavor
but
it
is
good
very
cold
its
refreshing
and
i
didnt
taste
the
usual
massbrewed
taste
of
so
many
similar
beers
its
no
great
shakes
but
if
you
need
an
exotic
beer
to
make
you
feel
cultured
this
one
is
ok
well
i
took
a
chance
and
tried
this
beer
it
wasnt
the
highlight
of
my
night
thats
for
sure
it
was
everything
beer
shouldnt
be
to
me
i
could
only
smell
alcohol
on
the
smell
the
appearance
was
decent
the
taste
brought
me
back
to
when
i
was
14
years
old
drinking
old
english
40s
behind
711
yeck
it
did
not
have
a
nice
mouthfeel
and
the
drinkablilty
was
nearly
impossible
for
me
unfortunately
i
was
unable
to
finish
this
beer
and
had
to
dispose
of
it
maybe
the
fishies
will
enjoy
it
i
dont
usually
go
with
asian
lagers
but
i
picked
up
a
special
filipino
treat
today
called
balut
which
apparently
goes
quite
well
with
beer
poured
in
to
my
new
bar
harbor
brewing
pils
glass
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
decent
enough
white
heading
looks
just
like
your
run
of
the
mill
golden
lager
not
a
whole
lot
going
on
in
the
smell
biscuit
bread
dough
fresh
grain
bit
of
hop
very
raw
smelling
taste
is
dry
and
fairly
complex
with
many
of
those
smells
coming
through
even
more
so
in
the
taste
body
is
light
nicely
carbonated
and
perfect
as
a
session
beer
this
goes
down
as
one
of
the
more
refreshing
beers
i
have
sampled
in
a
while
i
will
visit
it
again
when
i
am
looking
for
something
light
and
simple
now
lets
see
if
it
goes
well
enough
with
the
little
bird
cheers
mouthfeel
is
thin
with
good
carbonation
and
the
beer
is
resultantly
very
very
easy
to
drink
nothing
special
a
great
beer
to
have
with
thai
food
or
anything
spicy
really
its
just
because
its
so
strong
i
wouldnt
drink
more
that
2
at
one
session
because
itll
knock
you
down
if
you
have
more
than
that
pours
clear
light
gold
with
a
filmy
lasting
white
head
smell
is
sweet
honey
like
malt
taste
is
quite
sweet
with
no
strong
hop
characters
as
the
bottle
states
no
balance
or
hops
at
all
in
the
flavor
and
just
a
big
malty
sweet
bubbly
bit
o
water
not
great
in
fact
pretty
bad
over
the
years
i
have
been
drinking
this
beer
with
my
thai
food
so
i
thought
i
would
review
golden
lager
color
with
white
foam
that
recedes
to
nothing
a
fresh
unassuming
malt
aroma
there
is
a
pleasant
crispness
to
this
beer
and
a
nice
fresh
taste
a
nice
touch
of
hops
makes
it
wuite
refreshing
with
spicy
food
certainly
better
than
many
asian
macrolagers
imo
this
is
a
good
example
of
the
style
and
i
see
no
problems
having
it
again
this
is
one
of
the
best
in
the
category
and
it
can
be
found
cheaper
in
bombers
than
the
usual
imports
although
this
bomber
is
only
21
3
ounces
versus
24
this
warrants
a
try
something
about
the
phrase
american
macro
lager
already
lowers
a
good
beer
aficionados
expectations
never
the
less
i
had
to
give
this
one
a
try
served
it
well
chilled
in
a
pilsner
glass
poured
a
lucid
canary
yellow
with
a
mild
head
smell
was
faint
but
i
could
barely
pick
up
some
grassy
hops
and
a
little
malt
taste
was
pretty
balanced
with
some
spicy
hops
and
faint
malt
a
little
light
on
the
palate
with
a
crisp
finish
it
may
go
pretty
well
with
some
spicey
thai
food
but
i
think
something
sweeter
would
be
better
the
taste
is
similar
and
strong
flowery
fruity
with
grain
and
clear
but
smooth
alcoholic
warmth
and
a
spiceybitterness
in
the
finish
12
ounce
bottle
beer
is
a
very
pale
golden
color
with
a
slightly
sticky
head
pale
malt
notes
in
the
aroma
but
there
was
also
some
metallic
whiffs
that
i
found
somewhat
off
putting
carbonated
on
the
palate
which
helps
with
the
spicy
thai
food
taste
is
fairly
standard
for
the
stylesweet
malt
and
graininess
hint
of
hops
at
the
end
ok
with
thai
food
but
not
a
session
beer
served
really
cold
which
i
think
is
the
way
to
drink
this
one
not
as
bitter
in
the
grainy
malt
as
i
expected
and
actually
not
a
terrible
brew
to
throw
down
with
some
extremely
spicy
thai
food
looks
like
youd
expect
almost
like
beerflavored
sparkling
booze
eh
its
nothing
really
drinkability
a
fun
change
drinkability
an
average
beer
in
the
style
pale
lager
made
by
boon
rad
brewery
had
dinner
this
past
friday
at
a
cambodianthai
restaurant
in
allston
so
i
thought
id
grab
a
beer
to
match
the
cuisine
poured
into
a
cool
looking
chang
beer
glass
the
color
was
pale
yellow
moderate
head
with
abundant
amounts
of
carbonation
the
smell
was
average
very
faint
like
most
macros
tastewise
it
was
boring
a
plain
old
lager
in
a
fancy
different
bottle
only
ordered
it
to
match
the
fact
i
was
eating
asian
food
so
mission
accomplished
it
was
worth
one
and
done
thats
about
it
d
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
most
people
would
be
able
to
drink
several
of
for
me
the
beer
came
across
as
about
average
thus
i
probably
will
not
be
seeking
it
out
again
the
carbonation
was
great
for
a
lager
enough
to
make
it
refreshing
but
it
didnt
distract
from
the
taste
d
i
could
have
a
few
no
problem
i
would
need
to
try
one
purchased
in
the
states
to
compare
but
i
personally
felt
this
was
much
better
than
the
c
grade
it
received
drank
a
lot
of
this
beer
on
a
recent
trip
to
thailand
it
was
ok
not
great
the
mouthfeel
and
the
sppearance
was
average
i
did
notice
a
definite
difference
when
i
poured
the
beer
into
a
glass
as
opposed
to
drinking
it
from
the
bottle
and
let
it
warm
a
really
nice
caramel
flavor
came
out
and
made
it
much
more
drinkable
overall
an
okay
brew
but
nothing
singularly
fantastic
about
it
i
enjoyed
it
with
some
spicy
chinese
food
and
it
complimented
the
meal
nicely
try
it
if
youre
feeling
adventurous
or
while
eating
thai
food
otherwise
dont
bother
overall
not
a
particularly
drinkable
beer
much
too
thin
and
lacking
a
lot
in
the
flavor
department
d
average
but
its
always
proper
to
try
a
new
beer
especially
when
dining
on
the
countrys
cuisine
drinkable
yes
of
course
for
the
style
it
is
a
touch
hop
bitter
but
in
a
good
way
mouthfeel
is
just
the
slightest
touch
syrupy
but
otherwise
light
and
crisp
with
lots
of
carbonation
the
butter
and
cloves
only
emerge
after
a
closer
inspection
overall
very
easy
to
drink
simple
and
clean
everything
you
would
expect
from
an
asian
pale
lager
honestly
i
dont
really
like
pale
lagers
but
this
one
is
drinkable
by
my
standards
no
surprise
on
the
pour
crystal
clear
with
a
small
white
head
that
quickly
dies
down
nose
seems
slightly
nutty
flavor
is
slightly
sweet
with
that
touch
of
nut
that
just
shows
up
a
very
small
bit
i
also
got
what
i
thought
was
just
a
hint
of
apple
that
showed
up
and
left
in
a
flash
the
feel
is
surprisingly
high
on
smooth
bubbles
much
more
than
i
would
have
expected
drinkability
absolutely
there
is
by
no
means
a
lack
of
flavor
and
it
is
quite
smooth
the
semisweet
tone
might
turn
some
off
but
this
is
worth
having
once
or
more
tried
it
with
thai
food
at
a
thai
restaurant
on
christmas
day
it
poured
out
the
standard
straw
colored
lager
with
tons
of
carbonation
although
it
did
have
some
great
head
to
it
nice
crisp
and
clean
malty
scent
with
a
nice
clean
taste
went
down
fine
and
i
would
try
it
again
but
probably
only
with
thai
at
a
restaurant
just
a
nice
decent
macro
lager
d
ate
this
w
some
sushi
and
its
a
good
beer
to
pair
with
an
average
version
of
this
style
its
nothing
special
except
that
im
always
looking
for
opportunities
to
try
beer
from
other
countries
other
than
germany
belgium
and
the
uk
and
even
if
theyre
bland
oh
well
this
is
a
pretty
simple
beer
but
really
not
unpleasant
there
are
certainly
worse
drinks
to
sip
on
while
enjoying
a
meal
singha
is
light
crisp
and
good
for
a
macro
offering
poured
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
decent
white
head
that
lasted
a
while
aroma
is
typical
american
macrobrew
nothing
really
that
discernible
taste
is
malty
but
not
much
in
the
way
of
a
hop
character
to
it
mouthfeel
is
okay
and
beer
is
pretty
smooth
drinkability
is
fairly
high
as
there
is
nothing
really
offensive
about
it
not
an
abundance
of
taste
or
aroma
just
your
typical
lager
and
nothing
else
the
classic
thai
beer
despite
the
recent
upsurge
of
chang
the
name
and
mascot
pictured
on
the
label
the
singha
is
a
mythical
lion
believed
to
inhabit
the
forest
surrounding
the
home
of
the
gods
mt
meru
it
is
often
served
with
ice
at
bars
and
restaurants
contributing
a
you
guessed
it
significantly
more
watery
taste
however
the
ice
is
often
necessary
to
keep
the
temp
down
when
drinking
outside
and
helps
to
cover
up
some
of
the
less
desirable
flavors
fine
all
flavor
all
the
same
i
prefer
mine
without
ice
decent
as
far
as
macro
lagers
go
drinkability
good
when
very
cold
on
a
thai
afternoon
some
bars
in
bangkok
will
serve
it
over
ice
to
maintain
optimal
temperature
drinkability
an
ok
beer
to
sit
back
and
enjoy
with
a
spicy
thai
meal
not
one
of
my
favorites
though
d
not
bad
i
would
definitely
have
this
again
if
i
saw
it
at
a
thai
restaurant
and
i
think
that
it
would
complement
spicy
food
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
bring
any
of
this
oddball
brew
home
would
probably
make
a
great
palate
cleanser
for
most
asian
dishes
id
pick
this
up
in
a
restaurant
far
from
good
but
certainly
an
adequate
brew
for
the
proper
occasion
pours
pale
clear
straw
with
a
decent
head
smell
is
grassy
hops
some
sweetness
in
the
backround
fairly
typical
macro
aroma
taste
is
sweet
with
grassy
herbal
hops
actually
surprised
at
the
hop
presense
here
i
mean
there
arent
a
ton
of
hops
but
quite
a
bit
for
the
style
pleasant
bitterness
balanced
light
to
medium
mouthfeel
wellcarbonated
i
actually
wouldnt
mind
drinking
several
of
these
would
be
nice
with
spicy
food
overall
for
the
style
this
is
quite
nice
surprisingly
lightness
in
body
and
faint
in
flavor
but
am
i
holding
my
breath
for
a
thai
barleywine
or
chocolate
stout
no
sir
ree
this
must
go
excellently
well
in
the
heat
and
the
alcohol
makes
its
presence
known
before
too
long
excessive
imbibement
can
bring
on
some
crazy
bangkok
nights
i
was
prepared
to
hate
this
beer
but
to
be
honest
its
not
bad
for
what
it
is
it
goes
down
smoothly
has
an
enjoyable
sweetness
and
doesnt
leave
a
skunky
aftertaste
in
the
mouth
now
of
course
it
has
its
limitations
but
its
better
than
i
was
expecting
as
it
says
under
the
score
this
one
is
worth
a
try
i
tried
this
beer
on
september
14
2007
at
the
beer
bistro
in
toronto
the
beer
poured
a
dark
translucent
gold
with
a
light
whit
head
the
aroma
was
slightly
malty
with
a
whole
lot
of
grain
the
mouthfeel
was
mediumbodied
with
mild
carbonation
the
flavour
was
very
grassy
not
a
beer
i
will
buy
any
time
soon
if
ever
again
but
it
does
knock
another
country
off
my
beer
passport
pours
the
typical
pale
golden
straw
color
as
many
other
asian
and
latin
american
lagers
keeps
a
thin
lace
of
head
atop
the
beer
smells
of
pale
malts
with
a
hint
of
cooked
vegetables
and
a
touch
of
tea
hops
some
bread
and
honey
are
in
the
background
taste
reminds
me
a
lot
of
heineken
pale
malts
and
faint
adjunct
graininess
this
one
though
has
a
bit
more
of
a
nice
bittering
hop
kick
and
a
welcome
alcohol
warmth
from
the
6
mouthfeel
is
prickly
but
rather
substantial
in
weight
im
actually
impressed
with
this
i
see
this
falling
more
in
line
with
the
euro
pale
lagers
or
however
you
want
to
deal
with
the
arbitrary
pale
lager
style
guidelines
rather
than
american
adjunct
lager
this
beer
is
going
extremely
well
with
some
lamb
and
lentil
soup
i
cooked
up
d
meh
well
i
guess
i
would
pick
this
over
a
bud
but
that
is
about
it
and
only
if
i
was
in
thailand
similar
to
other
se
asian
lagers
but
with
a
bit
more
alcohol
pours
clear
yellow
with
a
small
white
head
nose
is
as
expected
but
maybe
with
a
tiny
bit
of
sweet
fruit
taste
is
metallic
grainy
yeasty
with
some
alcohol
and
slight
hops
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
both
poor
to
ok
a
row
of
2s
this
beer
poured
a
pale
golden
straw
color
with
a
foamy
bright
white
head
that
disappeared
quick
and
left
just
a
little
lace
on
the
glass
it
had
a
sweet
grain
smell
it
a
little
bit
of
a
flowerily
perfume
to
it
there
was
also
a
little
bit
of
a
carbonation
aroma
at
first
the
beer
had
a
malty
sweetness
and
a
grainy
flavor
it
had
a
little
bit
of
a
hops
bite
but
over
all
a
very
crisp
flavor
that
finishes
fairly
clean
it
has
a
light
smooth
crisp
feel
that
in
the
end
is
very
refreshing
all
in
all
i
would
say
there
wasnt
any
thing
too
surprising
with
this
beer
it
was
done
well
for
your
typical
lager
with
nothing
to
great
to
speak
of
edit
found
out
through
the
ba
mag
that
it
is
made
with
100
barley
malt
with
no
adjuncts
which
is
a
plus
in
my
book
my
girlfriend
picked
up
a
six
pack
for
me
nice
of
her
but
the
beer
is
not
anything
special
pretty
much
your
typical
macro
with
a
bit
more
flavour
and
a
higher
abv
clear
golden
colour
one
of
the
most
transparent
beers
i
have
ever
seen
the
nose
is
malty
and
sweet
with
a
hint
of
alcohol
and
slight
skunky
notes
pretty
much
tastes
like
it
smells
well
i
am
glad
she
didnt
buy
a
12
but
i
can
stomach
a
6
or
leave
them
for
my
friends
who
dont
really
care
what
they
drink
good
session
beer
if
the
local
minimart
is
out
of
budweiser
ha
overall
i
would
certainly
choose
this
over
most
american
macros
in
the
summer
if
anything
just
to
change
things
up
a
bit
worth
a
try
if
youve
never
had
it
d
not
a
bad
beer
for
what
it
is
i
guess
it
would
be
a
good
beer
to
get
drunk
off
of
with
6
0
and
pretty
much
goes
down
like
water
clear
straw
color
slightly
murky
leaves
a
while
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
bit
smells
of
floral
hops
taste
hoppy
and
bitter
not
to
my
liking
drinkability
decent
when
served
really
cold
on
a
hot
day
leave
this
on
the
shelf
flavor
is
slightly
sweet
with
a
mild
spicyness
and
a
crisp
finish
not
perfect
but
very
crisp
refreshing
and
gets
the
job
done
with
spicy
food
from
another
website
explaining
the
formaldehyde
rumor
strongly
suspect
that
the
originators
of
the
story
were
and
remain
american
and
british
expatriates
and
soldiers
trying
to
explain
what
was
to
them
an
odd
phenomenon
singha
you
see
is
not
just
another
international
lager

it
is
a
relatively
strong
6
alcohol
by
volume
and
is
an
exceptionally
bitter
lager
at
40
international
bittering
units
by
comparison
budweiser
is
about
5
abv
and
around
11
5
ibu
myth
busted
a
light
golden
look
with
a
fizzy
head
that
dissapeared
quicklys
not
a
distinct
smell
just
somewhat
hoppy
the
taste
is
overall
unimpressive
dominated
by
malt
and
leaves
a
dry
slightly
bitter
slightly
hoppy
aftertaste
i
have
had
this
beer
several
times
and
its
taste
can
improve
depending
on
what
you
eat
with
it
if
you
have
a
sweet
thai
dish
dont
drink
this
beer
if
you
have
a
spicy
thai
dish
this
beer
can
provide
a
decent
compliment
there
is
a
rumour
going
round
about
formaldehyde
being
used
in
some
of
the
asian
brews
not
sure
what
to
think
about
it
has
anyone
got
any
inside
infos
bottle
says
fill
date
of
082306
expiration
date
of
082307
served
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
clear
golden
yellow
with
pretty
much
no
head
at
all
the
aroma
is
just
malt
and
grain
nothing
else
that
i
can
tell
taste
is
sweet
malt
and
grain
but
its
not
offensive
theres
a
little
bit
of
hops
in
the
aftertaste
but
theres
not
much
bitterness
in
the
finish
supposedly
its
6
abv
but
you
cant
tell
that
at
all
mouthfeel
is
light
and
its
a
bit
watery
drinkability
is
ok
its
doesnt
go
down
bad
at
all
and
its
relatively
easy
to
drink
not
much
to
distinguish
this
from
most
typical
macro
lagers
but
at
least
its
not
awful
luckily
i
just
bought
a
single
bottle
of
this
i
dont
think
ill
seek
this
out
in
the
future
12
oz
bottle
color
of
golden
yellow
with
a
frothy
thin
white
head
nose
of
hay
straw
cereal
milk
and
slight
hopps

taste
of
malt
wet
hay
straw
and
acidic

body
is
acidic
and
textured

aftertaste
of
sweetened
malt
and
vanilla
extract

lingering
a
typical
lager
nothing
spectacular
but
it
is
certainly
more
palatable
than
some
beers
maybe
i
should
say
alleged
beers
i
have
consumed
appearance
and
smell
are
ok
taste
is
crisp
and
not
complex
and
there
is
no
bitterness
but
it
has
no
interesting
undertones
or
hints
a
good
beer
for
when
you
are
watching
a
game
or
at
a
party
worth
a
try
pretty
basic
macrolager
no
off
flavors
with
some
malt
and
hops
well
balanced
a
touch
of
bitterness
in
the
finish
appropriate
body
and
carbonation
smooth
with
a
crisp
and
dry
finish
no
complaints
it
goes
down
easily
ill
say
that
for
it
this
was
fantastic
sitting
on
the
beach
and
looking
over
phang
nga
bay
as
a
beer
to
appreciate
though
its
pretty
woeful
a
big
flavorful
lager
not
as
crispdryrefreshing
as
most
examples
but
the
body
and
flavor
make
it
a
nice
beer
maybe
just
not
a
refreshing
lawnmower
beer
notes
i
could
see
this
being
better
with
some
food
as
a
stand
alone
it
is
not
good
and
not
worth
another
purchase
due
to
the
freshness
this
could
be
a
decent
session
beer
as
this
22oz
bottle
had
a
fill
of
aug
17th
2006
just
10
days
old
why
cant
they
make
an
imperial
version
after
just
2
days
in
asia
i
would
do
anything
for
an
ale
porter
or
stout
this
is
a
good
solid
lager
which
is
a
perfect
compliment
to
thai
food
and
is
generally
available
at
thai
restaurants
pour
pale
gold
with
almost
no
head
retention
the
smell
is
fairly
typical
with
a
bit
of
a
hoppiness
to
it
and
the
taste
is
bitter
bit
balances
well
particularly
with
a
spicy
curry
well
carbonated
and
good
well
with
the
meal
but
not
likely
more
than
a
couple
bottles
taste
was
good
much
more
hop
bitterness
than
the
aroma
would
let
on
lots
of
bubbles
in
the
mouth
from
the
carbonation
good
with
food
not
really
something
i
would
want
to
pound
all
night
you
wont
go
wrong
with
this
beer
from
thailand
an
ok
beer
but
nothing
special
pours
a
clear
straw
color
with
a
nice
head
and
displays
good
carbonation
the
large
bubbles
turn
to
a
frothy
goodness
nose
displays
faint
hops
with
the
malt
being
most
evident
has
a
wellbalanced
malty
taste
with
a
ltttle
alcohol
bite
on
the
finish
feels
light
to
medium
bodied
and
is
quite
enjoyable
d
the
taste
is
quite
different
but
enjoyable
easy
to
drink
not
very
filling
would
definitely
not
buy
this
one
for
consumption
on
its
own
but
its
a
great
beer
for
pairing
with
something
spicy
which
brings
out
more
of
the
malts
and
allows
the
food
to
take
center
stage
finish
fairly
cripsly
without
cloying
and
matches
the
spice
of
thai
food
perfectly
had
this
beer
with
some
sizzling
beef
at
one
of
my
favortie
thai
resturaunts
poured
into
the
standard
food
establishment
mug
it
had
a
golden
yellow
color
the
nose
was
cereally
and
slightly
malty
the
taste
left
much
to
be
desired
but
was
refreshing
with
a
spicy
thai
meal
drinks
pretty
easy
especially
in
hot
humid
weather
this
is
beer
is
fairly
consistent
be
it
in
thailand
or
abroad
never
was
wowed
by
this
but
a
nice
thirst
quencher
or
acompanyment
to
some
seafood
curry
or
padthai
overall
it
was
better
than
i
expected
for
the
style
which
is
not
one
i
generally
like
nothing
offensive
in
this
beer
just
a
basic
macro
lager
but
better
than
many
macros
md
the
carbonation
is
wellcontrolled
not
as
fizzy
on
the
palate
as
it
looks
while
the
clean
palate
and
no
presence
of
undesirable
sugary
taste
make
this
6abv
lager
pretty
drinkable
all
in
all
this
is
a
mediumbodied
beer
without
impressive
elements
of
a
really
good
lager
but
is
wellbalanced
and
void
of
any
unwanted
taste
of
chemicals
and
adjunctsan
honesttasting
beer
so
to
speak
not
something
id
feel
like
revisiting
any
time
soon
though
i
discovered
this
beer
on
a
recent
trip
to
thailand
and
feel
in
love
with
it
i
think
it
has
been
unfairly
treated
by
some
of
the
reviewers
after
all
its
an
adjunct
larger
brewed
for
drinkers
working
and
living
in
a
tropical
climates
singha
dumps
all
over
boring
euro
pilsners
and
it
also
has
far
more
flavour
whilst
being
just
as
refreshing
as
many
other
asian
beers
this
is
a
very
good
example
of
a
light
adjunct
larger
i
get
this
at
my
favorite
thai
place
where
the
choices
are
this
or
miller
products
its
better
than
any
miller
product
which
is
saying
very
little
bland
inoffensive
thin
lots
of
carbonation
ok
foe
washing
down
spicy
food
but
basically
after
a
bite
of
thai
curry
you
cant
taste
it
anyway
ive
always
felt
that
strong
bitter
beers
go
better
with
spicy
food
but
it
sems
every
country
known
for
spicy
food
brews
weak
beer
go
figure
11
2
oz
serving
not
a
bad
lager
really
to
look
at
light
golden
attractive
carbonation
rising
to
a
quite
nice
looking
thick
white
head
aroma
is
mainlly
malty
no
chemicals
detected
a
mainlly
malt
driven
lager
and
really
its
quite
pleasant
actually
slightly
grassy
touch
of
citric
to
finish
not
that
bad
on
the
palate
ok
beer
all
in
all
much
better
than
i
was
expecting
this
reminds
me
of
becks
a
lot
not
all
that
bad
i
had
this
with
some
very
good
and
very
spicy
thai
food
on
a
hot
summer
day
so
i
was
unable
to
rate
it
as
thoroughly
as
if
i
had
just
been
taste
testing
however
it
had
a
good
appearance
yellow
with
pillowy
white
head
and
decent
lacing
the
aroma
was
very
difficult
to
dtermine
and
the
taste
was
basically
what
i
needed
at
the
time
cold
and
wet
not
a
bad
beer
all
and
all
poured
out
of
a
11
2oz
bottle
into
a
pilsner
glass
i
found
this
at
my
local
world
market
store
and
thought
id
give
it
a
try
poured
with
a
nice
head
that
quickly
dissapates
althoug
some
lacing
sticks
quite
well
to
the
glass
i
thought
the
beer
was
to
close
to
a
bud
light
though
but
holds
its
own
as
well
will
definately
go
well
with
spicy
food
or
is
a
beer
that
you
could
drink
a
lot
of
just
beware
of
the
alcohol
content
sweet
with
a
bitter
slightly
hoppy
taste
at
the
end
a
good
but
not
great
beer
while
fairly
smooth
its
a
mediocre
brew
at
best
even
for
the
style
it
wont
interfere
with
spicy
foods
which
it
is
good
enough
to
down
with
but
nothing
much
to
have
on
its
own
as
it
is
thin
and
lacks
any
character
d

above
average
for
a
macro
lager
d
it
is
a
pretty
good
asian
lager
next
time
im
at
my
local
thai
place
for
dinner
i
might
have
one
it
might
be
a
nice
compliment
to
the
spice
food
a
very
nice
asian
lager
enjoyable
and
few
complaints
most
of
these
asian
lagers
i
would
drink
in
a
restaurant
but
never
buy
to
bring
home
singha
is
an
exception
it
goes
well
with
spicy
thai
food
and
im
sure
it
would
go
well
with
other
spicy
dishes
as
well
not
manditory
but
worth
a
try
singha
pours
a
yellow
color
with
a
thin
white
head
from
a
brown
twelve
ounce
bottle
i
can
smell
corn
in
the
aroma
tastes
okay
for
a
macro
lager
a
little
sweetness
some
grain
crisp
finish
ive
had
worse
lagers
i
wouldnt
turn
one
down
on
the
other
hand
not
worth
seeking
out
this
beer
is
overpriced
though
for
the
2530
dollars
id
have
to
plunk
down
for
this
i
could
easily
get
a
case
of
superior
tasting
lager
ale
or
porter
pours
out
a
super
pale
almost
clear
yellow
its
like
adding
a
drop
of
yellow
food
coloring
to
a
pint
of
water
the
white
head
disappeared
very
quickly
smelled
lightly
of
corn
but
it
was
very
light
not
much
in
the
taste
its
very
smooth
on
the
tongue
there
might
be
a
bit
of
a
rice
flavor
in
there
it
wasnt
bad
at
first
i
was
enjoying
the
smoothness
of
the
feel
and
taste
but
then
as
it
warmed
the
alcohol
became
apparent
and
that
ruined
whatever
enjoyment
id
found
very
thin
mouthfeel
except
for
the
alcohol
disturbance
this
is
averagely
drinkable
certianly
a
classic
option
whenever
i
eat
thai
food
or
any
asian
dishes
for
that
matter
the
6
0
abv
is
a
bonus
with
such
an
easy
drinking
brew
i
think
this
is
one
of
the
better
imported
beers
for
the
style
i
have
had
worse
beers
but
this
is
certainly
not
a
pricewinner
an
interesting
beer
not
as
bland
as
could
be
expected
from
a
massproduction
asiatic
lager
this
beer
wasnt
a
bad
pair
for
the
thai
food
i
hadafter
the
spiciness
it
was
cool
and
refreshing
that
said
it
is
not
something
i
could
drink
on
its
own
as
it
is
so
boring
eric
the
pour
gave
a
very
thin
head
that
got
even
thinner
and
quick
was
a
golden
yellow
color
typical
of
the
style
smelled
of
faint
malts
somewhat
corny
and
sweet
the
flavor
was
almost
nonexistent
the
only
thing
going
for
it
is
a
pleasant
malty
sweetness
but
otherwise
it
lacks
any
discernable
traits
disappointingly
boring
and
bland
felt
springy
and
buoyant
in
the
mouth
but
unfortunately
there
was
nothing
backing
it
up
certainly
not
the
worst
beer
ever
but
so
nondescript
i
actually
wished
id
ordered
a
soda
instead
overall
ok
aroma
is
slightly
objectionable
but
not
excessively
so

doesnt
make
it
undrinkable
even
still
it
doesnt
do
that
much
positive
except
for
the
dry
bitter
finish
that
is
typical
of
some
german
style
pils
even
though
it
is
6
abv
the
alcohol
is
not
readily
apparent
this
beer
is
crisp
and
feels
average
for
a
macro
lager
on
the
palate
there
isnt
anything
outstanding
about
the
way
it
feels
the
carbonation
levels
are
typical
for
this
style
usually
being
fizzier
than
most
other
beer
styles
leaves
a
bit
of
what
i
would
refer
to
as
a
slick
sheen
on
my
tongue
that
quickly
is
removed
with
one
or
two
swallows
of
saliva
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
probably
prefer
it
over
all
other
macro
lagers
however
why
would
i
want
to
spend
money
agian
on
this
brew
dropping
57
dollars
for
a
six
pack
of
this
isnt
worth
it
sure
it
tastes
alright
and
is
probably
one
of
the
best
macros
ive
had
to
date
but
if
i
want
to
spend
57
dollars
on
beer
i
want
something
that
has
more
flavor
first
taste
is
as
expected
but
possibly
worse
alcoholic
bite
a
brash
and
unpleasant
acidity
that
isnt
citrusy
or
anything
just
sourness
oh
yeah
and
those
cheap
malts
i
was
telling
you
about
this
is
a
poorly
constructed
lager
and
greatly
offends
my
tastebuds
perhaps
my
stomach
as
well
since
i
can
feel
the
beginning
of
heartburn
too
carbonated
and
sticky
as
well
not
even
recommended
as
a
patio
beer
certainly
not
recommended
by
me
d
not
very
drinkable
slightly
unpleasant
light
in
body
with
a
fizzy
tang
turns
watery
mouthefeel
the
alcohol
is
pretty
well
hidden
but
the
overall
flavor
gets
a
bit
tiresome
as
most
lagers
do
for
me
pretty
ok
as
far
as
macro
lagers
go
overall
really
wasnt
taken
aback
until
the
taste
just
cant
bring
myself
to
drink
another
one
attractive

from
the
shelves
of
world
market
near
scott
afb
imbibed
at
what
i
believe
is
the
best
thai
food
in
pittsburgh
located
in
shadyside
my
thai
is
off
the
hook
when
eating
some
pad
kee
mow
or
pad
thai
you
have
to
have
a
crisp
tasty
beer
to
cool
down
the
fire
singha
thai
beer
is
just
that
appears
a
golden
clear
hue
with
forms
a
nice
sized
bright
white
head
leaves
behind
fine
vibrant
lacing
aroma
comes
off
as
german
in
origin
with
a
grassy
herbal
hop
character
sweet
lightly
toasted
2
row
malts
and
maybe
a
touch
adjuncts
in
probably
rice
im
guessing
along
with
this
im
getting
a
spice
sweet
ginger
tone
thats
just
barely
noticable
but
present
anyway
much
freakin
better
than
the
typical
asian
macro
the
taste
is
clean
flavored
crisp
lager
one
gives
the
balance
of
light
sweetness
and
herbal
hop
flavor
with
low
bitterness
but
mixes
well
and
complements
the
food
so
well
mouthfeel
is
clean
crisp
light
body
with
crisp
even
carbonation
very
nice
drinkability
definitely
a
beer
ill
continue
to
imbibe
on
when
eating
thai
really
helps
to
douse
the
addicting
fire
of
their
dishes
oh
and
after
the
beer
and
food
dont
forget
your
mango
with
sticky
rice
good
stuff
this
one
was
really
light
and
easy
to
drink
but
i
wasnt
in
too
much
of
a
hurry
to
finish
it
mouthfeel
is
thin
that
said
i
bet
this
would
be
great
for
washing
down
some
spicy
thai
food
when
you
dont
care
what
your
beer
tastes
like
d
well
its
a
macro
but
deceptively
good
given
the
initial
touch
of
skunk
ive
had
far
worse
for
sure
overall
a
decent
lager
but
hardly
worth
the
price
of
a
premium
beer
like
a
bud
for
the
orient
this
beer
has
a
very
weak
nose
and
a
sweet
taste
too
it
with
a
slightly
hoppy
bitter
aftertaste
it
has
a
very
light
mouthfeel
and
very
is
easy
to
drink
a
lot
as
others
have
mentioned
its
a
good
brew
to
pair
with
spicy
foods
i
e
great
for
putting
out
papaya
salad
and
pork
salad
fires
but
not
much
else
if
youre
at
a
thai
restaurant
pick
up
one
of
these
to
impress
your
cute
waitress
but
if
youre
at
the
beer
store
keep
walking
was
at
a
thai
restaurant
so
i
figured
why
not
12
oz
served
chilled
in
the
enlarged
flute
they
gave
me
looks
about
like
what
i
was
expecting
golden
with
a
small
white
head
and
average
carbonation
smells
pretty
clean
with
some
grassiness
and
some
green
applesgrapes
doesnt
taste
quite
as
good
but
still
tolerable
with
a
light
mouthfeel
and
id
say
its
pretty
drinkable
i
probably
paid
too
much
for
it
but
ah
well
thats
how
it
goes
when
you
eat
out
overall
not
a
great
beer
but
not
a
bad
beer
body
is
very
light
with
spritzy
carbonation
and
a
somewhat
chalky
mouthfeel
dont
bother
there
is
a
crisp
taste
that
is
pleasant
a
touch
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
swallow
beware
of
the
6
0
alcohol
it
certainly
isnt
present
in
the
taste
itll
catch
up
with
you
pretty
fast
okay
i
need
to
write
this
quickly
before
my
fing
laptop
freezes
again
this
is
also
a
test
run
the
pour
is
clear
and
a
gold
color
that
is
lighter
then
say
the
49ers
helmets
but
darker
and
much
more
beer
like
then
anything
from
bmc
im
getting
a
mild
grassy
hop
aroma
its
reminiscent
of
a
pilsner
just
softer
the
taste
is
clean
and
crisp
with
a
noticeable
hop
character
this
can
wash
down
any
type
of
food
and
do
so
with
a
satisfying
flavor
that
i
didnt
expect
from
a
macro
lager
drinkable
and
refreshing
ice
cold
and
does
work
well
with
spicy
food
pours
light
straw
colored
no
head
moderate
carbonation
smells
of
wheats
light
hops
and
a
bit
of
skunk
smell
is
stronger
not
as
good
as
heineken
taste
is
also
heinekenish
but
more
bitter
and
lighter
also
the
finish
is
not
as
clean
it
wasnt
all
that
great
i
think
if
i
had
had
a
spicier
dish
it
would
have
gone
better
but
as
i
went
with
a
milder
entree
this
time
the
beers
subpar
quality
was
more
pronounced
if
that
makes
any
sense
i
almost
always
have
one
at
a
thai
restaurant
but
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
otherwise
for
an
imported
beer
i
bought
it
cheaply
however
not
cheap
enough
to
buy
again
the
smell
and
taste
is
upfront
grainy
with
some
cooked
scents
but
not
objectionable
its
sweet
but
a
balancing
dry
feeling
from
the
alcohol
and
hops
a
nice
level
of
hops
through
the
drink
and
then
a
lingering
bitterness
not
as
watery
as
i
had
expected
it
has
a
nice
body
for
a
pale
lager
a
pleasent
surpise
to
have
with
my
pad
thai
i
guess
this
is
about
what
youd
expect
from
the
style
but
its
better
than
the
likes
of
bud
or
miller
lite
and
better
than
some
of
what
mexico
and
japan
offer
too
id
probably
order
it
when
eating
at
a
thai
restaurant
drinkability
is
decent
as
i
had
no
trouble
finishing
this
a
golden
color
with
excellent
carbonation
and
very
little
head
i
smell
malt
and
some
light
hoppy
texture
not
a
complex
beer
but
not
bad
either
i
enjoyed
this
with
some
asian
cuisine
and
it
went
well
this
brew
is
refreshing
and
quiet
so
as
not
to
disturb
the
tastebuds
there
isnt
much
going
on
here
but
what
is
there
isnt
offensive
or
harsh
overall
i
enjoyed
this
with
my
food
but
it
is
on
the
bland
side
without
a
lot
to
offer
i
will
have
this
again
but
it
is
not
a
favorite
nor
is
it
something
i
will
want
often
had
this
a
thai
restaraunt
it
was
this
or
bmc
poured
a
clear
pale
straw
tellow
with
a
finger
of
white
fizzy
head
that
actually
stuck
around
for
30
seconds
or
so
nose
is
faint
a
clean
light
malt
a
bit
of
grassiness
taste
was
a
grainy
malt
with
a
slightly
spicey
hop
finish
nothing
really
great
simple
but
more
flavorful
than
most
macros
ive
had
and
didnt
taste
nasty
as
it
warmed
up
medthin
mouthfeel
high
carbonation
this
is
an
above
average
macro
went
pretty
well
with
my
mildly
spicey
thai
and
i
will
get
this
again
next
time
i
eat
out
here
a
good
brew
for
the
region
borrows
some
characteristics
for
bohemian
pilsners
brigh
gold
in
appearance
accessive
carbonation
good
head
retention
smells
moderately
malty
hoppy
and
a
little
sourness
skunk
tastes
nicely
malty
and
grainy
hops
bring
out
a
bite
and
some
spiciness
skunkiness
fades
after
a
minute
or
two
moderate
to
light
body
finishes
clean
and
mildly
alcoholic
golden
yellow
pour
with
a
small
disappating
head
mild
to
medium
hop
aroma
but
theres
definitely
something
funky
going
on
here
bitter
taste
and
almost
tastes
slightly
skunky
yet
its
nothing
so
harsh
that
you
cant
drink
the
beer
oily
mouthfeel
with
a
bit
of
a
bitter
aftetaste
i
could
drink
a
couple
of
these
if
i
had
to
but
i
would
much
rather
prefer
something
else
interesting
beer
though
definitely
like
nothing
ive
tasted
before
not
the
best
taste
but
quite
good
for
a
macro
at
5
9
actually
that
isnt
saying
much
kind
of
harsh
and
burny
on
the
tongue
tastes
like
it
would
get
gross
fast
though
really
cold
it
would
be
ok
on
a
hot
thai
evening
the
more
i
drink
the
more
i
lower
my
score
for
flavour
rough
and
unpleasant
mouthfeel
and
abysmal
drinkability
i
would
not
want
to
be
drinking
this
all
night
overall
quite
a
bad
beer
this
beer
is
what
it
is
nothing
special
but
not
bad
either
the
aftertaste
is
a
bit
of
a
downer
and
the
aroma
isnt
very
enticing
but
all
in
all
its
alright
i
wont
rush
out
to
buy
another
but
wouldnt
turn
one
down
either
i
swear
when
i
drank
this
that
it
was
in
a
1
liter
bottle
and
it
seemed
like
it
was
10
abv
but
that
might
have
just
been
the
feel
do
to
the
fact
of
the
20
hours
in
airports
or
airplanes
it
was
a
smooth
refreshing
beer
with
not
a
whole
lot
of
flavor
or
originality
light
color
light
head
light
hops
light
flavor
the
malt
and
bitterness
gives
it
a
slightly
refreshing
welcome
to
thailand
pretend
you
in
europe
feel
pours
a
thin
straw
color
with
no
head
at
all
smells
of
nothing
at
all
luckily
or
unluckily
it
has
some
flavor
tastes
very
sweet
but
not
malty
at
all
a
little
bitter
but
no
hop
flavor
at
all
i
wonder
if
they
brewed
this
entirely
with
adjuncts
and
concentrated
hop
oil
the
mouthfeel
isnt
too
bad
but
not
too
good
either
just
a
lot
of
carbonation
and
some
heaviness
all
in
all
its
fairly
drinkable
simply
because
it
doesnt
have
any
bad
flavors
i
probably
wont
bother
getting
it
again
since
i
can
get
bland
flavorless
beer
for
much
cheaper
than
3

a
pretty
solid
standard
macro
lager
from
thailand
pairs
well
with
spicier
foods
a
good
lager
with
more
flavour

i
had
expected
and
it
works
very
well
with
spicy

a

with

great
carbonation

in

quite
weak
with
some
malt
and
light
alcoholic
side
to
it
malty
taste
with
some
hops
and
some
subtle
floral
notes
light
alcohol
burn
made
this
a
little
less
unpleasant
though
nothing
special
here
poured
out
to
a
clear
yellow
color
with
a
short
lived
foamy
head
odors
were
a
bit
skunky
but
not
enough
to
make
the
beer
undesireable
flavors
of
corn
and
malt
were
detected
finished
rather
crisp
with
a
touch
of
bitterness
on
the
aftertaste
worth
a
try
but
not
anything
to
go
out
of
your
way
to
find
my
bottle
gave
a
web
address
www
singha
com
that
does
not
work
and
was
stamped
for
export
only
interesting
considering
they
sell
the
same
stuff
in
thailand
maybe
this
is
a
way
of
determining
whats
to
go
overseas
and
whats
to
be
sold
domestically

out

not

the
distinct
malt
backbone
was
a
pleasant
surprise
and
the
lemon
departure
of
the
hops
near
the
finish
give
you
the
impression
this
is
a
sharp
spritzy
helles
just
the
thing
to
knock
back
with
some
spicy
tai
bar
bq
the
bottle
definitely
gives
the
impression
that
im
drinking
something
impressive
the
glass
i
just
emptied
does
not
labor
under
that
misapprehension
yeah
you
get
a
little
more
flavor
and
a
little
more
booze
and
maybe
that
helps
you
know
youre
alive
but
this
beer
simply
doesnt
taste
very
good
and
likely
wont
have
you
coming
back
for
seconds
very
oddly
shaped
12
oz
brown

medium

color
with
a
big
white
head
that
fades
to
an

not
getting
much
in
the
smell
department
very
metallic
and
citrusy
a
very
noticable
hop
presence
full
bodied
and
grainy
this
is
an
interesting
beer
one
that
actually
has
something
more
than
your
standard
import
lagers
probably
better
on
tap
at
the
openair
beer
markets
during
the
winter
but
im
no
snob
id
have
mine
anywhere
including
late
night
plastic
tables
outside
ampm
throwing
rocks
at
stray
dingoes
not
something
that
i
would
go
out
and
get
unless
adjunct
lagers
were
the
only
fare
or
thai
food
is
involved
but
a
rather
solid
lager
take
it
with
you
to
a
thai
restaurant
order

lighty
sweetmalty
with

detected

taste
is
a
little

sweetness
leading
to
a
sharp
bitter
hoppiness
that
dries
slightly
at
the
finish
lingering
hop
bitterness
leaves
a
pleasant
clean
aftertaste
in
my
mouth
a
nice
light
bodied
beer
that
falls
into
the
pilsnermalt
liquor
catagory
goes
down
great
on
a
warm
day
the
beer
poured
a
pale
yellow
had
no
head
whatsoever
it
was
pale
yellow
and
it
looked
very
much
like
budweiser
or
mgd
had
a
weak
bitter
taste
with
a
hint
of
syrup
left
a
hint
of
a
bitter
after
taste
the
only
reason
that
i
bought
it
was
to
drink
a
beer
from
thailand
its
not
the
worst
beer
that
ive
ever
had
thats
a
tie
between
miller
high
life
and
edison
light
but
its
not
very
good
try
it
to
say
that
youve
had
beer
from
thailand
comments
this
beer
was
better
than
i
expected
i
not
not
a
huge
fan
of
adjunt
lagers
but
this
one
is
worth
a
try
i
noted
that
the
label
says
that
the
ingredients
are
water
malt
and
hops
no
yeast
so
im
not
sure
why
this
is
an
adjunct
lager
or
how
it
was
fermented
for
that
matter
at
the
risk
of
copying
every
other
review
written
about
this
beer
it
seems
like
it
would
be
a
good
idea
to
pair
it
with
spicy
food
the
semisweet
lemony
tastearoma
pared
well
with
the
thai
food
little
disappointed
there
wasnt
more
hop
kick
but
still
little
aftertaste
yeah
could
drink
several
of
these
but
they
would
be
much
better
with
the
spicy
thai
food
will
have
them
again
i
figured
since
im
eating
a
spicy
dinner
that
i
should
drink
a
beer
brewed
in
a
land
where
spicy
cuisine
abided
pours
the
pale
adjunct
lager
yellow
a
shade
or
two
darker
than
urine
a
one
finger
head
forms
lasts
for
a
minute
then
quickly
fades
away
to
film
a
few
whisps
of
irish
lace
specifically
around
the
rim
where
the
beer
reached
its
peak
the
first
smell
was
killer
i
actually
exlaimed
yikes
they
expect
me
to
drink
this
the
second
smell
wasnt
as
bad
though
perhaps
my
nostrils
quickly
adjusted
who
knows
sulfur
which
is
what
i
believed
that
first
whiff
was
grains
grass
and
overcooked
vegetables
their
is
a
unique
taste
to
this
that
i
cant
quite
put
my
finger
on
what
is
it
i
looked
through
the
reviews
and
none
of
them
seem
to
ring
that
bell
on
what
that
taste
is
sort
of
a
stale
bittersour
taste
this
soon
subsided
to
a
diacetyl
lemon
grass
taste
with
a
malt
backbone
aftertaste
has
a
hint
of
that
unique
taste
but
a
little
less
stale
that
unique
taste
it
isnt
good
im
sorry
to
say
its
not
terrible
which
is
about
the
only
good
thing
i
can
say
about
it
the
mouthfeel
reminds
me
of
sea
water
something
i
would
not
choose
to
drink
again
ive
had
worse
beers
however
their
is
very
little
i
could
say
that
is
positive
about
this
beer
perhaps
this
is
a
beer
best
used
for
cooking
and
not
for
drinking
singha
has
a
touch
more
flavor
and
therefore
a
little
more
personality
than
many
macro
lagers
its
still
incredibly
mediocre
beer
if
i
ever
find
myself
in
bangkok
i
might
go
native
and
toss
back
a
few
cold
ones
absent
that
no
thanks
taste
is
sweet
and
lagery
almost
no
hops
in
the
taste
either
fairly
clean
aftertaste
oh
gosh
please
dont
drink
this
i
got
a
case
of
this
for
cheap
through
a
distributer
it
poured
yellow
and
smelled
like
water
6
abv
and
a
malt
liquor
if
that
is
what
you
like
buy
this
beer
if
you
are
going
for
the
high
went
into
an
area
market
and
this
was
going
for
10
99
a
six
pack
go
immediately
there
and
purchase
this
give
them
a
20
and
get
back
8
dollars
and
a
few
cents
change
and
then
quickly
pick
up
a
phone
and
call
the
police
you
have
been
robbed
i
did
get
some
thai
food
and
had
a
few
and
it
didnt
treat
me
too
bad
eh
below
average
i
think
pretty
standard
stuff
as
far
as
asian
lagers
go
it
pours
a
very
pale
yellow
colour
with
a
soapy
thinnish
head
that
dissolves
rather
quickly
the
smell
is
a
touch
malty
with
very
faint
hop
noticeabillity
perhaps
a
touch
sweet
and
even
a
bit
metallic
at
times
the
flavour
is
more
of
the
same
but
with
a
grassystraw
kind
of
flavour
this
one
sort
of
went
well
with
my
pad
thai
but
i
would
have
preferred
something
with
a
bit
more
body
and
flavour
overall
i
could
probably
be
coerced
into
sampling
this
one
again
with
thai
food
as
thats
its
origin
and
it
a
basic
brew
that
washes
down
the
food
somewhat
nicely
but
i
would
look
for
other
options
first
and
would
never
just
sit
around
and
drink
one
on
its
own
a
pale
yellowstraw
colored
beer
with
a
bright
white
head
that
disappears
quickly
there
is
a
light
sweet
and
grainy
aroma
with
just
a
hint
of
lemon
in
the
backgroung
the
taste
starts
out
with
that
light
sweetness
on
the
tip
of
your
tongue
but
there
is
a
good
assertive
hop
presence
that
takes
over
quickly
there
is
a
peppery
spiceyness
to
the
finish
that
is
interesting
the
6abv
is
not
high
enough
for
the
alcohol
to
make
its
pesence
felt
in
the
taste
but
you
do
start
to
get
warmed
up
after
a
few
unique
broad
shouldered
bottle
shape
sort
of
like
a
stubby
this
pours
a
very
clear
pale
yellow
color
the
head
quickly
disperses
into
a
pure
white
wisp
and
leaves
almost
no
lace
im
big
on
the
lace
the
smell
is
sweetish
with
some
lime
and
hop
notes
the
taste
is
also
sweet
but
a
lot
better
tasting
than
north
american
adjunct
lagers
the
cornrice
and
dms
are
at
an
absolute
minimum
theres
also
some
subdued
noble
hop
flavors
the
finish
is
sweetish
but
sufficiently
balanced
mouthfeel
is
quite
light
but
actively
carbonated
this
beer
is
quite
drinkable
with
no
really
off
flavors
nor
any
stand
out
ones
it
doesnt
seem
like
a
malt
liquor
to
me
too
flavorful
and
light
i
agree
with
the
other
bas
who
classify
it
as
a
german
pilsner
drinkability
not
bad
but
nothing
to
get
excited
about
either
this
beer
was
suggested
to
me
by
my
cousin
as
going
great
with
spicy
food
i
havent
tried
it
with
food
yet
but
it
isnt
that
bad
a
beer
pretty
decent
if
you
want
to
drink
a
beer
this
is
not
what
you
should
reach
for
however
it
does
serve
an
important
role
a
lot
of
thai
food
is
pretty
spicy
and
when
you
eat
something
very
spicy
you
want
to
reach
for
a
glass
of
water
to
wash
it
down
alas
theres
no
booze
in
water
and
thus
it
cant
get
you
drunk
enter
singha
this
is
a
flavorless
textureless
odorless
beer
its
essentially
seltzer
that
also
gets
you
tanked
which
can
be
a
very
good
thing
after
eating
some
really
spicy
noodles
it
isnt
like
youd
be
able
to
really
taste
much
of
anything
anyway
so
it
would
be
a
waste
to
get
a
delirium
to
eat
with
your
spicy
pad
thai
however
if
youre
going
to
be
going
to
a
thai
place
and
need
something
to
put
the
fire
out
singha
acts
as
water
extra
pours
a
pale
yellow
with
a
foamy
white
head
skunky
nose
with
a
very
faint
background
of
real
hops
taste
is
full
of
adjunct
malt
tempered
slightly
by
a
light
fruitiness
and
a
touch
of
hops
mouthfeel
is
a
little
bit
foamy
with
a
strange
stickiness
around
the
roof
of
the
mouth
probably
ok
if
youre
drinking
it
with
thai
or
chinese
food
but
on
its
own
im
not
impressed
note
i
wish
i
could
be
more
descriptive
in
my
review
but
this
is
not
the
type
of
beer
that
lends
itself
to
description
it
simply
is
neither
good
nor
bad
12oz

a
little

just
an
average
lager
thx
what
a
suprise
this
was
pours
a
light
golden
yellow
with
a
foamy
frothy
head
that
retained
farely
well
lacing
was
gobbing
down
the
glass
with
each
sip
the
smell
was
of
corn
and
grain
slight
alcohol
scent
a
little
roasted
malt
detected
the
taste
was
smooth
and
sweet
the
crisp
refreshing
hops
went
well
with
the
caramelly
smoothness
a
medium
bodied
lager
hints
of
fruit
bring
up
the
rear
a
great
lager
very
drinkable
great
with
kung
pao
chicken
or
spicy
foods
what
made
this
beer
stand
out
from
others
like
it
was
its
dryness
the
malt
was
well
hidden
behind
this
crisp
dryness
and
lingering
hops
the
hops
didnt
bite
per
se
but
squeezed
the
tongue
through
out
the
taste
very
clear
pale
golden
with
a
very
thin
white
head
that
didnt
last
long
stale
hop
smell
sweetness
evident
with
a
characteristic
lager
sharpness
the
flavour
was
lightly
sweet
with
some
bitterness
balancing
things
at
the
finish
fairly
well
balanced
with
a
light
body
enjoyed
at
a
nice
gloucester
thai
restaurant
pours
an
appealing
bright
gold
with
a
white
and
lacy
head
smells
crisp
and
pilsnerlike
this
beer
isnt
bad
it
focuses
on
the
spiciness
of
the
hops
a
crisp
and
refreshing
beer
this
does
what
it
was
designed
to
do
compliment
thai
food
but
in
my
opinion
it
cant
compete
with
the
best
czech
pilsners
and
then
about
halfway
into
the
bottle
a
mask
of
pressure
settles
around
my
eyes
and
sinuses
i
check
the
bottle
and
find
a
freshness
labelfill
122503so
its
not
that
old
a
bottle
the
discomfort
lets
up
in
a
little
while
but
its
unsettling
i
think
ill
try
something
else
for
thai
food
next
time
like
a
draft
i
had
in
college
only

gives

starts
with
a

then
reveals
some
light

it
warms
in

and
finishes
with
another
touch

a

from

that

a

be

this

a

quite
the

good
session
lager
had
this
on
draft
in
poland
and
glad
it
is
available
in
the
uk
now
one
of
the
better
mass
produced
lagers
that
is
widely
available
nothing
special
very
avarage
in
taste
o
drinkable
but
not
very
exciting
poured
from
can
cant
really
detect
much
of
an
aroma
maybe
a
bit
floral
pours
clear
and
pale
the
slightest
hint
of
bitterness
light
and
thin
with
average
carbonation
overall
not
that
great
but
still
somewhat
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
overall
a
standard
euro
lager
acceptable
but
not
mind
blowing
i
only
bought
a
can
of
it
but
apparently
dan
murphys
sells
it
for
36
for
a
case
of
24
x
500ml
making
it
the
cheapest
beer
by
far
overall
serviceable
but
indistinguishable
pale
lager
ok
but
nondescript
overall
a
truly
boring
beer
i
prefer
a
bit
dryer
beer
but
for
anyone
looking
for
a
good
crisp
euro
lager
that
might
turn
their
wife
on
to
beer
this
could
be
it
another
premium
beer
that
offers
nothing
of
the
sort
at
least
this
one
is
actually
ok
i
could
see
downing
multiple
cans
of
it
were
i
in
the
company
of
polish
friends
at
a
summer
cue
otherwise
just
an
average
eurolager
and
all
that
implies
tropewise
visavis
their
yankee
counterparts
i
havent
had
a
beer
from
my
ancestral
homeland
in
a
while
but
this
find
on
a
local
mixasix
shelf
lends
me
such
an
opportunity
it
pours
a
clear
brass
topped
by
a
finger
of
lightly
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
musty
wheat
light
flowers
very
light
brown
grass
and
a
faint
hint
of
the
beginning
of
skunking
i
have
no
idea
why
as
the
store
in
question
isnt
conducive
to
daylight
entering
the
store
to
any
appreciable
degree
much
less
the
beer
section
near
the
back
wall
but
at
least
the
skunking
seems
to
be
at
a
decided
minimum
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
the
mustiness
in
full
force
stronger
than
ever
providing
evidence
that
the
skunklike
smell
wasnt
actually
evidence
of
skunking
but
rather
a
crappy
beer
hell
the
finish
is
awash
in
soilencrusted
tobacco
this
is
awful
the
body
is
a
hefty
light
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
slightly
watery
feel
overall
what
i
thought
was
a
case
of
lighttaint
turned
out
to
just
be
a
horrid
beer
well
at
least
i
dont
have
to
have
a
talk
with
the
beer
manager
and
better
i
dont
have
to
drink
any
more
of
this
swill
wannabe
o
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
and
has
some
pleasant
flavors
of
bready
malts
but
it
seems
a
little
bland
and
like
it
could
use
some
more
in
the
way
of
hops
like
most
polish
lagers
this
is
a
clean
and
well
finished
beer
but
with
mot
much
in
the
way
of
complexity
since
it
is
in
a
can
there
is
no
skunk
so
the
lightness
of
the
beer
tastes
fresh
nothing
really
wrong
with
this
beer
but
no
memorable
at
all
so
i
probably
will
go
with
a
grolsch
or
a
wernesgruner
next
time
this
wasnt
exactly
an
interesting
beer
not
entirely
offensive
but
there
wasnt
enough
offered
here
that
would
make
me
reach
for
another
one
of
these
i
had
worries
about
a
green
bottled
beer
from
a
cooler
case
but
this
had
no
signs
of
skunk
at
all
and
for
what
it
is
was
a
totally
enjoyable
beer
very
good
for
the
hot
weather
now
o
good
decent
lager
nothing
bad
to
say
about
it
overall
an
above
the
average
pils
very
pleasant
and
with
high
drinkability
overall
an
easy
drinking
lager
from
lech
nothing
super
spectacular
with
the
flavours
going
on
but
a
very
refreshing
brew
for
a
hot
day
i
always
like
to
come
back
to
my
roots
with
polish
beers
and
this
is
one
of
the
ones
i
return
to
didnt
like
this
one
at
all
normally
if
a
beer
is
subpar
due
to
an
issue
like
it
being
past
its
prime
or
infected
then
i
wont
review
the
brewer
chose
green
bottles
and
thus
its
skunkyass
flavor
pass
unless
you
cant
find
another
poland
tick
elsewhere
normal
looking
pale
lager
head
fizzes
away
quickly
but
i
got
a
decent
amount
of
thin
lacing
smells
grainy
slightly
lemony
weakly
of
hops
and
some
honey
tastes
not
bad
pretty
good
in
fact
but
nothing
special
there
is
nothing
off
about
this
beer
but
it
is
a
bit
thin
in
the
flavor
dept
a
bit
more
of
everything
thats
in
here
would
make
this
a
damn
good
beer
the
way
it
is
this
could
be
a
goto
summertime
quencher
if
it
were
cheaper

an
unimpressive
c
overall
definitely
not
one
of
my
faves
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
but
i
dont
see
myself
buying
it
again
in
the
future
the
taste
was
of
sour
grain
and
cheap
hops
it
was
not
especially
good
it
was
better
than
plenty
of
american
macrobrews
but
it
was
definitely
not
good
my
favourite
thing
about
this
beer
was
the
name
lech
i
felt
like
leching
so
i
had
myself
a
lech
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
but
its
nothing
special
it
reminds
me
of
a
lot
of
the
massproduced
czech
pilsners
easy
to
drink
refreshing
but
not
particularly
memorable
overall
ehhh
no
taste
just
dont
like
the
corn
taste
and
the
shitty
malts
they
use
this
beer
is
good
great
balance
of
hopsmalt
and
at
5
2
percent
it
is
more
or
less
the
perfect
lager
very
impressed
with
this
eastern
european
lager
offering
worth
it
for
sure
i
think
that
the
only
thing
that
could
make
this
beer
a
tad
better
is
if
i
could
find
it
in
a
glass
bottle
so
as
to
not
tamper
with
the
natural
flavor
too
much
try
this
one
if
pronounced
properly
lech
is
a
sound
that
would
normally
only
ever
come
out
your
mouth
when
vomiting
but
i
assure
you
it
shouldnt
come
to
that
although
it
may
not
live
up
to
polands
full
potential
its
doubtful
to
exercise
any
gag
reflexes
and
more
likely
than
not
should
actually
prove
itself
a
middleoftheroad
easily
quaffed
lager
pours
as
close
you
can
get
to
clear
with
a
yellowish
tinge
white
head
that
dissipates
with
some
lacing
smells
of
cooked
vegetables
with
some
very
mild
grassy
aroma
flavour
is
almost
nonexistent
but
a
some
small
off
flavours
in
there
not
completely
bad
either
since
the
flavour
is
quite
faint
huge
carbonation
makes
this
a
bit
harder
to
drink
would
be
ok
on
a
really
hot
day
but
not
in
the
winter
took
a
chance
on
buying
this
not
impressed
the
finish
gets
more
crisp
as
you
drink
it
better
than
say
slavutich
and
better
than
i
expected
would
like
to
try
a
fresher
sample
however
drink
a
nice
light
lager
good
for
the
summer
months
an
average
beer
that
i
might
seek
out
again
if
the
weather
is
right
drinks
similar
to
many
other
european
pales
such
as
grolsch
or
peroni
when
you
can
find
it
on
tap
not
a
terrible
buy
at
a
substantial
discount
over
these
more
readily
available
brands
still
nothing
spectacular
to
add
to
the
world
of
beer
usually
there
are
better
alternatives
to
be
had
for
the
same
price
at
most
establishments
even
in
poland
it
is
a
good
lager
beer
if
you
are
thirsty
no
more
and
no
less
balanced
mouthfeel
and
dito
drinkability
d
light
enough
to
drink
several
but
only
when
kept
very
chilled
taste
drastically
changes
for
the
worse
as
it
starts
to
warm
drink
fast
this
beer
looked
good
but
not
much
else
nothing
offensive
just
nothing
worth
mentioning
overall
it
was
fun
drinking
this
beer
i
knew
it
would
taste
like
an
american
macro
but
europepoland
has
different
malts
and
hops
than
us
so
it
was
fun
to
try
something
new
it
was
a
fun
experience
fairly
drinkable
wont
get
this
one
again
there
are
much
better
beers
of
the
style
for
that
price
very
good
drinkability
id
seek
this
one
out
again
interestingly
a
66
liter
bottle
poured
into
a
pokal
initial
head
faded
quickly
it
settled
into
a
deep
amber
with
just
a
trace
of
carbonation
the
aroma
was
very
strong
right
after
pouring
a
slightly
sweet
and
fresh
scent
the
mouthfeel
was
mundane
and
the
taste
middling
drinkable
but
nothing
memorable
my
polish
boss
from
whom
i
received
the
beer
indicated
that
this
is
one
of
the
most
popular
beers
in
her
country
the
lack
of
complication
probably
lends
weight
to
its
popularity
this
beer
got
my
attention
at
my
work
wines
unlimited
of
stratford
ct
we
have
a
pretty
good
beer
selection
especially
of
eastern
european
beers
this
one
lech
seemed
curious
to
me
being
a
polish
beer
it
aroused
my
curiosity
because
i
have
had
some
decent
polish
beers
the
last
few
weeks
this
beer
is
amazingly
drinkable
but
lacks
a
nice
head
and
lacing
the
head
is
a
egg
foam
like
appearance
which
is
nothing
to
scream
about
the
beer
is
colored
with
a
pale
golden
hue
with
transparent
waterline
edges
also
while
it
maybe
very
versatile
it
tastes
of
a
watered
down
lager
similar
to
a
crappy
pilsner
not
that
i
hate
pilsners
of
course
but
a
little
better
however
it
still
sells
very
well
in
our
store
for
probably
two
reasons
one
being
that
it
is
a
polish
beer
and
that
our
polish
clientele
will
naturally
go
for
it
and
two
being
that
most
americans
prefer
light
lagers
or
pilsners
anyway
so
when
they
experiment
on
a
unknown
beer
they
obviously
get
something
they
think
they
would
like
overall
this
beer
was
ok
not
great
very
drinkable
and
makes
a
good
addition
to
any
beer
selection
a
great
pour
into
a
tall
flute
got
me
two
fingers
worth
of
bonewhite
head
with
solid
retention
color
was
a
deep
gold
with
nequality
clarity
nose
had
a
definite

was

premium
like

beer
with
the
word
premium
on
the
label
is
fairtomiddlin
at
best
i
was
all
set
to
call
it
blech
but
its
actually
a
decent
drinkable
version
of
the
style
and
its
better
than
most
american
pale
lagers
with
multimillion
dollar
advertising
budgets
was
served
at
an
outdoor
bar
near
old
town
warsaw
had
a
big
white
fine
foamy
head
with
lots
of
lace
color
was
a
bright
clear
polished
brass
aroma
was
a
common
beery
very
fresh
clean
and
balanced
tween
malt
and
hops
flavors
exactly
the
same
body
was
decent
and
so
was
carbonation
not
a
lot
of
flavor
nothing
offends
its
ok
and
thats
about
it
finish
is
very
short
bittersweet
leaning
towards
sweet
could
be
a
session
beer
because
its
so
easy
thanks
to
a
friend
for
bringing
this
can
back
fresh
like
this
its
a
decent
euro
lager
clean
and
wellmade
but
nothing
special
in
character
its
more
simple
proof
the
brewers
are
technically
adept
than
anything
else
its
slightly
sweet
and
smooth
and
completely
unremarkable
drinkability
totally
middle
of
the
road
im
not
spitting
it
out
ill
enjoy
the
rest
of
the
pint
if
offered
another
i
might
accept
but
i
might
also
go
for
the
many
other
better
options
for
this
style
its
just
a
weak
beer
it
is
too
sour
kind
of
like
a
pilsner
gone
kind
of
wrong
there
isnt
anything
that
stands
out
and
it
leaves
a
bad
aftertaste
not
a
fan
pours
a
clear
dark
yellow
not
quite
gold
with
a
white
head
and
active
carbonation
the
smell
is
hard
to
detect
but
a
little
earthy
like
grain
the
taste
is
slightly
bready
with
some
grain
hop
some
euro
skunk
the
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
okay
it
goes
down
fairly
crisp
and
clean
but
i
couldnt
see
myself
drinking
more
than
one
every
once
in
a
long
while
this
this
is
basic
polish
lager
which
is
what
everyone
drinks
when
theyre
not
drinking
vodka
drinkability
it
is
average
on
levels
but
it
is
also
refreshing
if
you
see
this
one
give
it
a
shot
itll
be
in
my
basket
the
next
time
im
out
d
very
drinkable
d
drinks
quick
and
painlessly
like
a
cheap
euro
pale
lager
should
d
drinkability
is
not
very
a
typical
europale
that
underachieves
and
leaves
much
to
be
desired
dont
bother
not
one
of
my
favorite
beers
i
bought
it
because
i
was
told
polish
delis
in
my
area
cannot
keep
it
on
the
shelf
tyskie
is
much
better
whoever
is
buying
it
up
can
have
my
share
drinkability
in
fairness
it
was
drinkable
just
nothing
special
actually
left
me
with
a
little
stale
aftertaste
that
could
only
be
abated
by
another
drink
typical
blah
euro
lager
no
horrible
but
nothing
id
go
back
to
again
nothing
particularly
special
but
better
than
the
average
epl
in
my
opinion
at
only
a
buck
and
small
change
for
the
500
ml
bottle
its
not
a
bad
lawnmower
beer
d
poor
taste
poor
mouthfeel
i
dont
feel
refreshed
just
a
stale
residue
left
on
the
tongue
give
me
a
rothaus
pils
chicago
poured
a
pale
yellow
pretty
transparent
but
with
a
decent
head
that
disappeared
soon
after
smelled
like
an
indescript
lager
but
with
added
stale
sweetness
sweetness
becomes
much
more
apparent
in
the
taste
overcoming
any
corny
adjuncts
or
sharp
edges
slight
hop
bitterness
not
much
to
speak
of
moderate
carbonation
fairly
watery
making
for
weaker
characteristics
but
higher
drinkability
almost
like
a
light
bock
if
i
may
be
so
bold
the
only
english
words
on
the
can
are
premium
and
party
so
i
didnt
really
know
what
to
expect
however

this
one
is
a
russian
version
of
a
classic
pale
lager
and
its
comparable
to
other
european
beers
of
that
style
i
like
their
porter
a
little
more
but
this
works
when
its
warm
outside
your

pilsner
it
doesnt
say
light
beer
on
the
bottle
but
it
kind
of
tastes
like
one
easy
drinking
not
bad
but
nothing
about
it
is
particularly
interesting
overall
an
ok
beer
if
you
havent
tried
it
i
would
suggest
it
to
knock
it

taste

some

just
a

feels

in

mouth
and
overall
is
a
refreshing
and
pretty
good
beer
o
the
best
thing
about
this
beer
is
the
fact
that
it
came
in
a
16
oz
tallboy
can
with
a
big
orange
99
sticker
on
it
there
are
a
lot
of
adjunct
malts
in
this
one
and
it
is
a
little
too
sweet
for
me
easy
to
drink
but
not
one
that
i
will
get
again
o
although
this
beer
seemed
a
little
bland
i
didnt
mind
drinking
it
because
it
was
pleasant
tasting
wasnt
that
sweet
and
went
down
easily
the
taste
is
about
what
i
would
expect
from
a
pale
lager
with
grain
and
barley
leading
the
charge
a
slight
sweetness
ending
with
a
clean
finale
it
is
a
pale
lager
that
is
typical
and
average
for
the
style
o
a
little
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
decent
representation
of
style
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
its
something
that
i
would
only
choose
if
my
options
were
quite
limited
pours
a
clear
light
yellow
with
a
foamy
white
head
that
settles
to
a
thin
cap
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
slowly
drip
into
the
remaining
beer
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
grain
and
some
slight
vegetal
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
some
corn
flake
and
grassy
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
an
average
beer
but
its
drinkable
and
pretty
refreshing
served
this
russian
euro
lager
from
a
bottle
and
poured
into
a
pint
glass
poured
a
clear
golden
color
produced
a
thin
white
head
poor
retention
and
left
little
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
consisted
of
malted
grain
apples
and
hints
of
spicy
hops
light
in
body
this
euro
lager
had
a
foundation
of
cereal
grains
honey
and
spicy
hops
tastes
and
feels
better
than
it
looks
or
smells
overall
its
a
fairly
easy
drink
could
use
more
alcohol
but
i
think
i
prefer
this
to
budweiser
or
czechvar
owill
drink
it
often
if
i
could
find
it
often
i
was
sampling
this
because
its
listed
as
a
classic
example
of
the
standard
american
lager
so
i
figured
i
try
the
russians
take
on
this
style
this
a
bit
better
the
average
lawnmower
beer
not
that
ill
be
stocking
up
on
these
but
ill
try
a
few
of
the
the
other
styles
from
baltika
overall
an
average
to
slightly
above
average
pale
lager
it
is
definitely
drinkable
but
probably
not
something
i
would
seek
out
again
overall
this
beer
is
drinkable
but
poor
enough
to
earn
an
avoid
recommendation
food
match
im
going
to
be
lazy
and
say
russian
cuisine
done
rjt
this
beer
is
silky
and
smooth
and
easy
to
drink

anyone
who
tries
this
beer
though
the
rest
meh
pretty
standard
unremarkable
lager
id
rather
have
a
genny
a
pretty
good
lager
ive
been
meaning
to
shore
up
this
baltika
series
but
have
been
pretty
lazy
about
it
thankfully
this
bottle
was
sent
to
me
it
pours
a
clear
pale
straw
topped
by
about
a
finger
of
lightly
dirty
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
damp
wheat
light
corn
syrup
grass
light
flowers
and
a
touch
of
white
bread
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
along
with
a
strong
vein
of
painful
sweetness
that
bludgeons
the
tongue
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
wet
feel
overall
a
pretty
sad
beer
one
with
little
character
at
all
appearance
is
straw
yellow
with
a
crisp
head
that
dissapates
quickly
smell
has
a
clean
aroma
of
grain
with
a
spice
not
and
hops
taste
of
corn
sweetness
with
the
grain
leaving
a
lingering
sweetness
thats
dry
at
the
end
mouthfeel
is
light
with
good
body
and
carbonation
a
classic
euro
lager
a
bit
on
the
sweet
end
d
ok
this
one
is
pretty
light
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
in
a
sitting
but
is
it
anything
really
special
well
not
really
a
pretty
average
euro
lager
o
not
complex
at
all
but
a
good
thirst
quencher
notes
its
decent
drinking
all
the
way
around
cheers
this
is
a
decent
lager
but
nothing
special
i
wouldnt
jump
at
the
chance
to
have
another
dr
its
not
cheap
nor
is
it
particularly
good
but
its
a
better
lager
than
budweiser
not
that
thats
saying
a
great
deal
4

abv
is
concealed
but
normal
o
this
is
actually
one
of
the
better
beers
of
this
style
that
i
have
tried
some
i
find
skunky
that
honey
aftertaste
it
left
was
also
a
nice
change
this
would
work
well
for
a
session
beer
and
i
would
have
no
problem
trying
this
one
again
this
beer
pours
a
light
amber
color
with
a
decent
white
head
the
smell
is
light
and
slightly
malty
the
taste
follows
through
with
a
slightly
sweet
malty
background
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
light
with
good
carbonation
for
what
it
is
its
not
a
bad
beer
would
drink
again
but
would
probably
not
buy
it
overall
the
carbonation
levels
are
a
little
too
high
on
this
one
and
the
taste
is
just
average
its
not
undrinkable
but
i
wouldnt
buy
it
again
for
sure
overall
not
recommended
overall
its
not
that
good
its
very
boring
very
much
a
summer
lawnmower
beer
a
touch
better
then
a
macro
lager
but
thats
not
saying
much
the
cooler
needs
some
multicultural
status
plus
what
hot
russian
babe
doesnt
dig
baltika
dtrue
session
beer
but
i
prefer
other
examples
of
the
style
avoid
worth
checking
out
drinkability
i
actually
like
this
brew
despite
its
other
ratings
not
complex
at
all
but
not
badtasting
either
excellent
session
beer
i
could
drink
this
stuff
all
day
long
and
accordingly
gets
the
maximum
drinkability
score
available
lager
category
limits
smell
taste
score
but
i
still
would
give
strong
points
for
taste
and
finish
ability
to
quench
thirst
baltika
do
a
fine
job
on
other
offerings
too
5
l
bottle
pours
straw
color
with
large

and
soda
like
carbonation
taste
is
soda
like
as
well
bread
sugar
with
some
herbal
hops
struggle
to
provide
some
balance
some
skunk
as
well
there
are
some
light
hops
in
the
finish
medium
body
is
smooth
and
sweet
not
very
good
brew
got
this
a
few
days
ago
and
just
opened
it
out
of
the
fridge
at
my
friends
house
poured
with
a
smallish
fine
white
head
and
no
lace
color
is
a
clear
slightly
pale
yellow
with
small
and
large
bubble
trails
aroma
is
malty
and
sweet
flavor
is
like
nose
very
little
hop
heavy
grain
flavor
body
is
ok
and
so
is
carbonation
finish
is
like
flavor
and
totally
forgettable
straw
yellow
colour
with
some
nice
white
head
and
very
mild
lacing
smells
a
little
grassy
with
lots
of
grain
and
bread
quite
a
clean
flavour
but
way
too
mild
to
say
this
actually
tastes
good
very
high
carbonation
level
easy
to
drink
a
couple
of
these
and
i
ended
up
doing
that
last
night
i
agree
w
the
other
reviews
that
this
is
a
very
good
example
compared
to
many
other
macro
lagers
this
is
a
solid
beer
and
something
good
to
turn
to
when
you
want
to
just
enjoy
a
cold
one
drinkability
this
beer
may
not
have
much
in
the
way
of
flavor
but
it
is
extremely
quaffable
im
sure
this
stuff
is
fantastic
on
a
hot
russian
afternoon
the
beer
pours
a
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
wheat
grain
and
lemon
about
what
i
was
expecting
the
flavor
is
a
lot
of
grain
and
wheat
with
a
tad
bit
of
lemon
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
nothing
offensive
but
nothing
too
exciting
i
think
baltika
3
is
about
as
good
as
it
gets
for
industrially
produced
massexported
lagers
if
this
is
in
fact
the
famous
beer
of
russia
as
its
brewers
claim
then
id
argue
that
its
rightfully
earned
that
title
its
not
hard
to
imagine
how
something
so
refreshing
clean
tasting
and
easily
drinkable
would
enjoy
such
mass
appeal
and
worldwide
success
db
cheap
pint
improved
version
of
bud
with
lots
of
flavor
good
for
the
style
for
the
most
part
crisp
and
refreshing
but
still
what
it
is
d
this
isnt
the
worst
beer
out
there
but
it
certainly
isnt
anywhere
near
the
best
i
think
this
is
a
good
chugging
beer
as
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
and
its
easier
to
handle
if
you
arent
trying
to
figure
it
out
with
this
said
i
would
probably
have
no
more
than
two
bottles
of
this
then
move
on
its
just
so
sweet
and
malty
my
second
in
the
baltika
series
the
beer
pours
from
the
half
liter
bottle
a
golden
color
with
a
wispy
head
the
nose
above
is
mainly
bready
malt
with
a
touch
of
grassy
bitterness
there
too
this
would
be
a
very
refreshing
beer
if
it
were
not
so
sweet
with
pale
malt
the
beer
does
have
a
little
dry
bitterness
at
end
one
could
drink
these
for
quite
a
while
i
believe
baltika
3
not
a
bad
brew
for
the
buck
far
worse
ways
to
spend
your
money
than
this
overall
it
was
a
very
nice
light
tasting
lager
its
different
than
most
lagers
with
the
surprising
hint
of
malt
in
it
very
good
i
would
highly
recommend

and

grass
and
yeast
taste
is
similar
to

smell
a

this
is

with
a
bit
of
citrus
bleh
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
fizzy
pretty
awful
all
around
d
well
maybe
on
a
humid
russian
summer
day
this
would
be
okay
when
i
was
in
russia
in
the
peace
corps
this
beer
did
the
trick
many
times
but
now
that
i
have
a
better
appreciation
for
better
beers
i
cant
see
diving
into
this
for
too
long
coming
out
of
the
bottle
i
really
did
not
expect
there
to
be
any
color
at
all
i
was
somewhat
surprised
to
see
a
bright
yellow
almost
urine
color
liquid
accumulating
at
the
bottom
of
the
glass
no
head
at
all
smell
is
almost
identical
to
an
american
bmc
lager
a
fairly
plain
tasting
lager
not
altogether
bad
just
nothing
to
make
it
stand
out
at
all
some
malt
hops
and
water
mouth
feel
is
also
kind
of
meh
very
thin
body
you
can
certainly
drink
this
and
probably
many
of
them
i
am
just
not
sure
why
one
might
want
to
not
that
bad
actually
im
unlikely
to
pick
this
one
up
too
often
but
still
i
cant
say
its
a
terrible
beer
certainly
better
than
most
other
cheap
eastern
european
pale
lagers
out
there
baltika
3
is
a
very
clear
pale
golden
lager
with
a
big
waxy
lumpy
white
head
that
has
good
retention
the
aroma
is
funky
grassy
and
corny
with
notes
of
dms
and
vegetables
its
mediumlight
bodied
scratchy
and
papery
with
a
sandpaper
finish
one
taste
of
this
and
i
feel
like
im
going
to
go
live
under
a
bridge
its
all
fusel
and
dms
i
think
my
eyebrows
are
falling
out
if
i
had
this
at
a
blind
tasting
i
wouldntve
guessed
it
was
beer
poison
this
is
challenging
and
not
in
a
good
way
notes
this
beer
pretty
much
takes
the
place
of
a
light
beer
while
it
isnt
anything
special
in
regards
to
all
of
the
beers
in
the
world
it
is
however
a
decent
attempt
at
this
style
and
better
than
other
beers
that
taste
similar
it
is
light
while
remaining
somewhat
flavorful
it
definitely
has
a
bigger
hop
presence
than
most
lighter
beers
very
light
yellow
with
friable
2finger
head
some
lace
grain
aroma
with
tones
of
dough
paper
medium
carbonation
proper
grain
taste
less
hop
paper
alcohol
vegetable
notes
not
very
pleasant
aftertaste
however
drinkability
is
low
beer
only
for
1
time
enjoyed
this
more
than
the
other
two
pale
lagers
ive
had
from
this
brewery
at
least
the
carbonation
isnt
too
high
poured
into
a
standard
pint
glass
clear
very
pale
strw
color
with
a
foamy
head
that
disperses
quickly
had
that
typical
imported
lager
smell
and
i
did
not
have
high
hopes
for
this
one
but
it
tasted
not
bad
and
it
washed
my
grilled
burgers
down
very
nicely
nothing
really
special
here
but
not
bad
cheers
very
drinkable
quality
beer
you
could
do
worse
for
the
style
nothing
special
but
definitely
an
above
averge
quality
mainstream
lager
overall
i
am
impressed
by
this
beer
it
is
brewed
by
the
second
largest
brewery
in
europe
so
i
would
expect
it
to
be
more
generic
it
feels
high
quality
though
and
rivals
some
good
german
vienna
lagers
and
pilsners
that
i
have
had
my
bottle
poured
with
better
head
and
better
retention
than
many
stouts
and
porters
nothing
offensive
but
nothing
worth
looking
for
d
could
easily
drink
a
few
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
this
maybe
this
bottle
isnt
that
old
but
its
impossible
for
me
to
tell
with
the
dating
system
but
it
appears
as
though
this
beer
is
a
few
years
old
the
brown
bottle
might
have
saved
it
a
nice
suprise
cheers
overall
this
one
is
my
favorite
eastern
euro
lager
thus
far
great
example
of
what
this
category
should
taste
like
in
my
opinion
out
of
a
bottle
handdelivered
to
me
by
my
beautiful
russian
bombshell
this
beer
was
a
pale
golden
yellow
color
with
three
fingers
of
head
the
retention
was
ok
and
the
lacing
about
the
same
the
aroma
was
of
pale
malt
stale
grains
and
faint
hops
the
flavors
were
similar
dominated
by
the
grains
mostly
corn
with
some
sweet
malt
and
herbal
hops
i
liked
the
bittersweet
balance
and
it
finished
crisp
the
mouthfeel
was
average
the
body
light
and
the
carbonation
on
the
high
side
nothing
amazing
aside
from
the
fact
that
it
came
all
the
way
from
russia
just
for
me
in
this
regard
it
was
great
feel
is
nice
with
a
pleasant
tingle
although
the
body
is
overall
a
bit
sticky
yeah
flavours
are
just
a
bit
skewwhiff
and
they
dont
taste
fresh
or
crisp
which
means
this
isnt
all
that
pleasant
or
drinkable
its
close
to
being
both
though
mouthfeel
is
light
and
crispy
drinkable
lager
poured
with
little
head
into
a
pint
glass
medium
carbonation
and
a
light
straw
colour
initially
looked
like
a
macro
lager
which
it
is
but
i
was
astonished
to
find
it
had
a
slight
malty
aroma
and
a
nice
malty
flavour
with
some
grassy
notes
it
was
pretty
dinkable
i
had
this
over
dinner
with
a
russian
friend
and
russian
food
so
the
context
added
a
lot
to
the
enjoyment
all
in
all
this
is
a
slightly
better
macro
lager
that
was
thoroughly
drinkable
and
a
much
better
alternative
to
the
average
australian
swill
that
gets
passed
around
here
ill
have
this
again
no
doubt
even
though
theres
a
lot
of
superior
euro
lagers
out
there
a
great
bbq
drink
this
beer
pours
a
very
clear
pale
golden
hue
with
lots
of
puffy
thin
white
head
that
leaves
minor
lace
around
the
glass
as
it
recedes
it
smells
of
mildly
sweet
white
grain
and
a
herbal
grassiness
the
taste
is
sweet
white
grain
kind
of
cloying
and
earthy
grassy
noble
hops
the
carbonation
is
on
the
high
side
the
body
fairly
solid
with
a
bit
of
glycerol
slickness
and
it
finishes
offdry
a
small
vegetal
sweetness
hanging
on
solid
atmosphere
the
appearance
is
better
than
average
decent
nose
pretty
basic
flavor
but
nice
balance
drinks
easy
pretty
nice
little
quaff
d
very
sessionable
i
have
to
admit
not
being
much
of
a
lager
guy
it
was
better
than
i
expected
would
pick
this
one
over
a
budmillercoors
for
sure
not
sorry
i
had
it
but
probably
wont
get
it
again
over
all
not
unenjoyable
by
any
means
but
i
dont
imagine
i
will
go
out
of
my
way
to
purchase
it
again
is
this
the
budweiser
of
russia
love
the
numbered
beers
by
the
way
ill
have
a
3
and
a
4
for
my
comrade
drinkability
good
this
is
a
very
decent
import
lager
overall
i
dont
see
myself
buying
this
one
again
but
glad
i
tried
it
2
5
d
not
ungodly
bad
but
the
style
isnt
something
good
to
begin
with
well
its
certainly
interesting
and
it
fits
the
style
the
russians
sure
could
do
better
though
the
taste
likewise
starts
as
a
rather
fullbodied
grain
with
light
herbal
and
grassy
hops
sweetish
with
light
bitterness
but
then
degrades
to
a
simpler
taste
of
slightly
old
grain
and
grassy
hop
id
have
no
problem
drinking
this
beer
again
however
its
definitely
better
cold
further
down
the
glass
as
the
beer
warmed
to
room
temperature
it
lost
quite
a
bit
of
flavor
and
turned
a
bit
stale
d
this
beer
wont
blow
you
away
but
its
a
decent
average
beer
for
the
style
to
me
its
a
russian
macro
lager
thats
not
too
bad
overall
i
drank
the
heck
out
of
this
beer
when
i
was
in
kyrgyzstan
with
the
the
army
a
few
years
ago
we
could
get
it
cheap
and
it
was
good
at
the
time
my
tastes
have
changed
a
bit
since
then
my
idea
of
good
beer
back
then
was
busch
light
i
had
a
hard
time
finding
baltika
here
until
recently
this
beer
is
good
for
what
it
is
supposed
to
be
it
is
a
good
alternative
to
the
american
adjunct
lagers
pours
a
light
gold
with
a
very
nice
looking
white
head
that
has
decent
retention
and
a
good
frumpiness
smells
are
faint
and
leaning
towards
sweet
but
artificial
honey
notes
flavors
are
very
subdued
slightly
sweet
malts
with
just
the
suggestion
of
hops
inoffensiveness
and
mass
appeal
seems
to
be
this
beers
goal
and
in
that
sense
it
is
a
success
several
other
styles
by
baltika
are
much
better
especially
the
hefeweizen
d
quite
drinkable
given
the
abv
and
what
it
has
to
offer
will
drink
again
drinkability
instantly
forgettable
as
theres
nothing
inherently
wrong
unique
or
even
pleasant
about
it
some
might
even
go
as
far
to
say
it
drink
pretty
good
clear
watery
pale
yellow
look
with
great
lacing
and
a
thin
patchy
head
aromas
were
a
bit
weak
with
some
grassy
tones
great
bittersweet
taste
with
a
somewhat
citrus
flavoring
to
it
very
refreshing
with
a
good
solid
carbonation
overall
the
best
of
the
baltika
series
i
have
had
so
far
although
the
taste
is
not
extremely
good
and
does
not
score
too
far
above
average
the
beer
is
very
very
drinkable
especially
considering
its
price
drinkability
an
ok
beer
not
great
but
id
reach
for
this
before
many
domestic
offerings
would
be
a
good
change
from
typical
grillassociated
lagers
drinkability
its
really
good
for
one
thing
and
that
is
drinking
this
in
multiples
i
would
drink
this
over
bud
coors
and
miller
any
day
but
its
really
just
a
step
above
them
if
anything
pretty
good
for
a
pale
lager
abundant
aroma
mild
maltiness
with
some
crisp
hops
standard
pour
nothing
to
complain
about
mouthfeel
is
nice
but
the
finish
falls
off
kind
of
watery
and
lacking
good
taste
this
one
got
better
and
smoother
towards
the
end
slightly
sweet
again
a
good
maltiness
rather
crisp
d
an
alright
beer
maybe
a
tad
better
than
the
2
taste
is
still
on
the
edge
of
total
blandness
russian
beers
are
always
fun
to
break
out
with
your
friends
it
makes
it
seem
like
you
went
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
to
find
one
nothing
spectacular
kind
of
like
a
russian
budweiser
but
crisper
tasting
possibly
a
better
grade
of
hop
still
pours
clear
yeallow
with
a
big
white
head
same
corny
sugar
aroma
picked
up
a
mixed
4
pack
of
baltika
brews
this
pale
lager
gave
a
pretty
bad
first
impression
with
a
skunky
smell
but
the
flavor
ended
up
being
pretty
decent
d
not
bad
but
fairly
typical
of
the
style
it
just
lacks
a
lot
of
character
when
i
learned
what
the
style
of
this
beer
was
i
initially
cringed
based
on
the
previous
euro
pale
lagers
that
ive
had
i
wasnt
expecting
much
of
this
brew
however
this
one
is
actually
not
that
bad
there
isnt
a
whole
lot
in
the
flavor
department
but
its
redeeming
characteristics
are
the
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
it
basically
seems
to
be
what
i
remember
the
previous
beers
of
this
style
to
be
but
it
has
what
is
arguably
the
most
important
charactaristic
of
a
beer
taste
probably
the
first
russian
beer
i
have
had
but
i
could
be
mistaken
not
bad
for
the
money
but
probably
would
not
buy
again
might
be
worth
trying
if
you
are
looking
for
a
good
deal
rather
than
a
high
quality
brew
i
poured
this
russian
lager
into
a
heavy
seas
pint
glass
this
baltika
beer
was
clear
pale
and
straw
yellow
in
color
on
top
of
this
pale
yellow
beer
was
a
14
to
12
an
inch
head
of
white
foam
this
small
head
of
foam
had
decent
retention
that
left
behind
a
small
white
film
and
a
few
small
blots
of
lace
usual
macro
appearance
the
aroma
was
weet
and
malty
with
malted
corn
a
touch
of
malted
rice
a
pinch
of
malted
barley
and
then
finishes
up
sweet
with
sugar
and
yeast
the
taste
was
crispy
sweet
and
filled
a
ton
of
malted
grains
like
corn
rice
and
barley
there
wasnt
much
after
the
grains
all
i
got
was
a
slight
bitter
finish
with
some
crispy
floral
hops
this
was
a
light
bodied
lager
with
a
malty
aftertaste
of
more
malted
grains
it
was
a
very
grainy
beer
in
the
end
its
another
run
of
the
mill
cheap
lager
beer
filled
with
cheap
malted
grains
well
at
least
i
can
it
was
cheap
in
price
but
you
usually
get
what
you
pay
for
kind
of
bland
and
kind
of
rough
but
palatable
run
of
the
mill
pale
lager
if
you
ask
me
tmdi
got
this
from
russsia
when
my
brother
in
law
went
over
there
this
is
a
decent
brew
but
not
the
best
from
this
brand
the
taste
ids
smooth
as
silk
and
goes
down
very
easy
i
could
drink
this
all
night
long
i
look
forward
to
more
d
an
average
continental
lager
youre
not
going
to
get
the
depth
of
malt
flavour
youd
find
in
a
mainstream
german
lager
but
for
an
easy
drinker
you
dont
have
to
think
about
its
not
bad
being
russian
brewed
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
its
ok
but
then
so
is
heineken
i
like
this
beer
not
too
over
the
top
in
any
area
but
it
is
seems
to
do
everything
quite
well
it
has
a
pleasant
flavor
it
is
slightly
sweet
fairly
low
alchohol
level
4
8
makes
it
very
drinkable
i
would
buy
this
again
when
i
am
in
the
mood
for
something
a
bit
better
than
the
typical
americancanadian
lagers
d
easy
to
drink
this
is
not
particularly
complex
but
it
is
good
for
what
it
is
and
certainly
the
best
lager
baltika
makes
d
better
than
bmc
pale
lagers
but
still
not
all
that
great
if
this
stuff
was
as
cheap
as
old
milwaukee
it
could
be
a
good
lets
get
drunk
party
beer
in
the
summer
pretty
boring
really
but
it
is
clean
and
refreshing
i
might
get
my
bud
lightloyal
father
some
of
this
stuff
next
time
i
go
home
pours
a
very
very
pale
yellow
color
with
a
fizzy
white
head
that
settles
incredibly
quickly
moderate
carbonation
some
faint
grassy
aroma
along
with
a
bit
of
apple
taste
has
just
a
bit
of
sweetness
mouthfeel
is
very
thin
and
watery
low
flavor
levels
help
to
make
this
brew
a
good
candidate
for
a
palate
cleanser
and
i
suppose
would
make
fairly
good
session
beer
as
well
heres
hoping
the
batch
i
had
was
poor
despite
the
lack
of
lightstruck
taste
good
luck
cause
i
couldnt
finish
mine
this
is
another
euro
pale
lager
that
isnt
going
to
get
rave
reviews
just
because
of
what
it
is
but
i
find
this
one
refreshing
without
having
any
horrible
flavors
what
else
can
it
do
it
a
good
beer
for
the
style
recommended
if
youre
mowing
the
lawn
or
something
a
very
typical
and
boring
macro
pils
tasting
beer
good
mouthfeel
as
there
is
a
medium
bodied
feel
to
it
slick
on
the
tongue
with
lingering
sweetness
an
okay
beer
wont
offend
anyone
but
will
not
impress
anyone
either
ive
only
had
a
few
of
their
offerings
so
far
but
if
i
was
pretending
to
be
russian
id
drink
baltika
beer
especially
given
what
else
ive
tasted
from
that
neck
of
the
woods
drinkability
is
fine
i
found
nothing
offputting
on
this
one
one
of
the
better
beers
of
this
genre
imo
would
have
no
problem
drinking
again
very
enjoyable
pours
a
strong
yellow
with
a
frothy
white
head
that
fades
fast
smell
is
very
sweet
with
malts
corn
and
grain
the
taste
is
not
as
sweet
as
the
smell
grainy
and
malty
not
a
ton
of
flavor
but
a
good
amount
is
there
a
sweet
aftertaste
finishes
off
the
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
very
light
with
good
carbonation
this
one
is
great
cold
on
a
hot
summer
day
a
very
easy
drinker
that
is
a
step
up
from
most
lagers
overall
i
wasnt
too
impressed
by
this
offering
from
baltika
it
was
very
watery
but
not
bland
there
is
a
constant
metallic
taste
throughout
my
experience
with
this
its
not
really
worth
the
96
cents
i
spent
on
this
try
it
if
you
want
youre
not
missing
out
overall
not
a
bad
beer
a
bit
sweet
but
still
drinkable
and
pretty
refreshing
pours
a
light
straw
yellow
with
pillow
white
head
right
off
i
am
hit
with
a
hint
of
hops
and
malty
sweet
aroma
corn
taste
is
very
mellow
with
little
hop
bitterness
and
very
little
malt
character
except
for
this
sweetness
that
tastes
like
cream
of
corn
no
balance
really
this
beer
would
be
better
if
the
malt
and
hops
were
in
balanceotherwise
i
taste
an
unnatural
sweetnessespecially
at
4
8
little
hops
in
the
finish
with
light
mouthfeeldrinkability
is
good
if
you
want
an
easy
drinking
nondescript
beer
actually
i
grew
up
on
this
beer
i
had
it
on
a
regular
basis
since
i
was
about
1617
till
i
was
23
then
i
moved
to
us
and
did
not
have
it
for
quite
a
while
after
seeing
it
in
the
store
ive
decided
to
try
it
and
find
out
if
id
like
it
now
when
im
not
a
foolish
youngster
anymore
im
glad
to
day
i
was
not
disappointed
this
is
a
very
nice
very
balanced
lager
not
too
bitter
not
too
sweet
with
a
mild
pleasant
smell
its
hard
to
find
something
really
distinct
about
it
but
thats
because
nothing
overwhelms
and
nothing
turns
you
off
yes
it
is
highly
carbonated
but
i
like
that
a
fairly
nondescript
lager
with
a
few
desirable
characteristics
but
also
some
flaws
the
beer
begins
with
a
brightly
strawcolored
hue
good
head
formation
and
moderate
retention
very
mild
lacing
aromas
of
pilsner
malts
raw
cereal
grains
and
hints
of
corn
and
acidity
flavors
of
light
malts
prevail
later
showing
some
corn
flavors
dms
green
apples
acetaldahyde
and
soft
herbal
hops
the
texture
is
moderate
but
a
bit
slick
and
grainy
in
the
texture
light
acidity
lemongrass
show
up
intermittenly
through
the
drink
finishes
with
a
blend
of
the
light
malts
grain
flavors
and
mild
hops
the
beer
is
difficult
to
praise
but
fine
for
a
getitdown
kind
of
beer
got
it
for
2
50
at
the
foodery
in
philadelphia
wasnt
worth
it
yet
another
waytoo
carbonated
russian
beer
i
know
there
must
be
good
russian
beer
besides
all
the
russian
imperial
stouts
they
make
in
california
piss
yellow
swill
that
tastes
like
a
a
cross
between
club
soda
and
malt
liquor
i
ended
up
having
to
chug
it
in
order
to
get
my
moneys
worth
but
before
i
took
that
route
i
detected
a
sort
of
artificial
lemony
taste
which
i
suspect
is
being
used
to
cover
for
mediocre
or
spoiled
ingredients
if
youre
really
interested
in
trying
a
russian
pilsner
i
reccomend
tinkov
not
bad
but
also
very
carbonated
the
flavor
was
pretty
light
and
dry
and
slightly
bitter
the
aftertaste
was
its
real
distinguishing
character
sweet
yeasty
and
creamy
overall
this
beer
was
decent
and
i
especially
liked
how
unique
it
was
mouthfeel
is
on
the
light
side
this
strikes
me
as
a
swillin
type
of
beer
you
want
it
to
go
down
fast
and
not
linger
very
long
or
so
thats
my
impression
this
isnt
an
especially
drinkable
beer
the
taste
is
just
too
thin
and
not
at
all
complex
to
be
interesting
poured
pale
golden
from
the
bottle
into
my
homer
simpson
mug
i
was
pleased
to
see
a
good
twofinger

first
sip
was
disappointing
tasted
like
skunked
heineken
bit
of
a
pee
smell
second
sip
was
a
little
better
faint
sour
apple
taste
but
no
unique

lightbodied
light

thats
about
it
pours
a
crystal
clear
pale
light
straw
color
with
massive
meringue
like
head
and
excellent
tracing
aroma
is
close
to
nil
with
a
little
green
apple
and
a
touch
of
grain
no
cooked
corn
just
nothing
on
the
palate
a
smooth
slightly
sweet
malt
feel
hits
first
and
a
nice
light
noble
hop
bitterness
follows
finishing
a
little
jumbled
id
like
to
see
more
crispness
which
should
be
the
hallmark
of
this
style
overall
though
it
is
clean
and
refreshing
good
for
its
style
actually
probably
better
than
some
of
the
style
but
overall
it
didnt
do
much
for
me
d
overall
while
not
exciting
it
certainly
does
not
offend
moderate
flavor
with
moderate
drinkability
d
drink
ability
was
okay
it
was
almost
like

d
wheres
the
flavour
gone
this
beer
might
look
pretty
good
but
its
flavour
leaves
much
to
be
desired
it
might
be
easy
to
drink
but
is
much
sooner
switch
to
another
beer
i
wouldnt
rule
this
beer
out
completely
in
the
future
but
i
think
ill
wait
for
a
hot
summers
day
classic
beer
that
pretty
much
sums
it
up
plain
ol
beer
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
you
can
tell
it
is
mass
produced
and
you
may
as
well
be
drinking
one
of
the
big
breweries
of
the
united
states
no
outstanding
quality
no
remarkable
personality
im
going
to
buy
more
i
avoided
this
beer
for
months
because
i
thought
it
would
be
a
sub
par
eurolager
but
surprise
surprise
it
was
a
decent
fresh
tasting
pils
with
a
very
pale
colour
that
looks
quite
nice
in
the
glass
much
like
the
tuborg
pils
this
beer
has
a
decent
hop
finish
and
a
crispness
that
quenches
the
thirst
taste
is
lightly
sweet
very
nutty
and
grainy
with
a
decent
hop
profile
floral
earthy
soft
in
the
mouth
at
first
then
a
mild
carbonated
bite
and
finishes
sticky
and
dry
this
is
a
clinical
beer
style
wise
and
its
decent
not
cheap
tasting
and
drinkable
in
spades
a
good
summer
refresher
and
an
above
average
eurolager
taste
is
of
corngrainy
and
musty
finishing
off
dryvery
little
bitterness
and
light
carbonation
a
very
drinkable
beer
that
goes
down
rather
thin
and
easygreat
for
those
hot

days

i
tried
this
beer
on
july
25
2007
after
purchasing
it
from
my
local
lcbo
store
it
poured
a
nice
translucent
gold
calour
into
the
glass
with
a
large
head
that
disappeared
quickly
into
nothing
the
aroma
was
very
faint
malt
very
faint
the
mouthfeel
was
mediumbodied
with
high
carbonation
the
taste
was
awful
not
sure
how
to
describe
it
really
almost
has
salt
tones
to
it
from
a
500
ml
bottle
poured
straw
yellow
with
little
head
and
almost
no
lacing
nose
is
fruity
barley
with
just
a
hint
of
hops
mouthfeel
was
quite
weak
flavor
very
mild
very
short
and
light
finish
a
very
mild
lager
and
actually
drinkable
but
certainly
unremarkable
overall
its
not
gonna
blow
or
socks
off
but
on
a
really
hot
day
like
today
its
dam
refreshing
and
very
easy
to
drink
dnot
my
favourite
beer
and
probably
not
one
i
would
seek
out
again
with
no
real
style
on
the
label
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
i
believe
it
was
1
59
for
the
bottle
which
isnt
awful
still
with
the
relative
obscurity
of
this
beer
the
places
that
will
sell
it
will
probably
have
something
better
drinks
easy
nothing
complicated
here
but
better
than
bmc
to
be
sure
may
be
able
to
score
this
cheap
but
not
sure
it
will
always
be
in
good
shape
better
than
the
last
time
i
had
it
overall
very
average
beer
wanted
to
try
a
beer
with
its
own
russian
taste
not
something
that
tastes
like
its
from
a
busch
assembly
line
i
might
have
1
more
but
that
would
be
about
it
after
the
novelty
wore
off
very
pale
with
an
average
head
that
leaves
a
lot
of
lacing
on
glass
effervescence
is
good
with
lots
of
bubbles
rising
slowly
until
the
end
smell
of
grass
malt
and
a
hint
of
citrus
taste
is
similar
to
aroma
and
refreshing
with
a
bit
of
tartness
i
suspect
it
might
be
a
bit
of
wheat
in
this
one
since
it
leaves
a
fair
bit
of
lacing
and
taste
a
bit
tart
light
mouthfeel
and
easy
to
drink
this
beer
goes
down
well
on
a
hot
afternoon
skol
drinkabilitynotes
better
than
typical
example
of
a
euro
pale
lager
well
worth
a
try
drinkable
maybe
but
only
if
your
options
are
very
limited
nothing
to
get
too
excited
about
but
this
is
definitely
above
your
average
lager
easy
to
drink
and
very
refreshing
little
else
thanks
to
pegasus
for
sharing
pours
a
crytal
clear
straw
yellow
fizziness
reminiscent
of
typical
american
mass
produced
lagers
little
to
no
hop
aroma
some
fresh
grain
taste
is
close
to
water
with
a
splash
of
malt
thrown
in
for
kicks
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
watery
could
be
a
good
lawnmower
beer
but
theres
plenty
of
those
around
no
need
to
seek
out
this
russian
d
felt
pretty
ill
and
thirsty
again
after
1
pint
due
to
salty
aftertaste
and
high
carbonation
very
poor
indeed
will
never
try
again
another
beer
from
the
baltika
challenge
poured
with
a
big
old
white
head
on
a
very
thin
orange
beer
has
more
of
a
stink
to
it
than
baltika
2
sweet
some
peat
ethanol
not
super
inviting
taste
is
slightly
sweet
malt
alcohol
kind
of
raw
and
unrefined
like
a
beer
might
taste
if
a
russian
guy
was
making
it
in
his
shed
under
fear
of
persecution
smooth
ok
to
drink
but
i
wont
buy
it
again
looks
a
lot
like
baltika

clear
gold
with
a
small
white
head
nose
is
grains
and
very
mild
saaz
hops
mostly
corn
and
a
bit
of
earthiness
maybe
a
hint
of
alcohol
at
the
end
of
the
nose
tied
in
with
the
earthiness
which
is
odd
considering
the
low
abv
taste
is
grains
with
some
hops
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
better
than
2
but
still
jsut
average
all
in
all
not
very
impressed
i
shall
not
be
trying
this
beer
again
drinkability
did
i
just
drink
this
i
cant
remember
this
beer
is
pretty
basic
to
me
it
is
alot
like
your
typical
american
mass
produced
beer
but
with
a
little
more
punch
to
the
taste
and
smell
not
bad
but
not
great
either
taste
is
good
with
light
citrus
taste
somewhat
sour
paste
like
aftertaste
slight
floral
smell
quickly
turning
stale
not
a
real
bad
beer
but
there
are
some
tastes
and
flavors
that
are
beyond
myself
to
determine
d
looks
like
a
bud
smells
like
a
bud
drinks
like
one
too
aftertaste
bitterseet
faint
an
easyforgettable
beer
and
its
better
to
forget
it
ive
appreciated
and
enjoyed
some
of
baltikas
other
fare
so
i
came
into
this
brew
with
a
pretty
open
mind
unfortunately
theres
few
redeeming
qualities
with
this
beer
its
one
of
the
few
beers
that
ive
had
that
i
can
say
that
i
really
didnt
enjoy
pours
a
crystal
clear
yellow
color
with
a
fizzy
head
the
aroma
is
faint
with
hints
of
maltgrain
and
a
vegetal
and
corn
smell
it
was
not
at
all
appealing
the
taste
isnt
much
better
modest
sweetness
and
grain
with
a
little
harshness
watery
with
a
shallow
finish
unimpressive
i
was
glad
to
be
finished
with
it
this
is
a
boring
lager
it
lacked
real
flavor
i
drank
it
but
would
not
seek
out
another
not
worth
it
a
substandard
euro
lager
i
fancy
this
as
a
quaffing
thirst
quenching
beer
and
whilst
not
scaling
great
heights
it
is
purposeful
and
something
i
wold
drink
again

doesnt

for

the
flavor
has
a
marked

taste
with
some
candy
sweetness
and
more
apple

this
certainly
isnt
the
worst
tasting
euro
lager
ive
had
but
theres
something
about
it
that
makes
me
feel
like
gagging
when
i
take
a
sip
it
may
be
the
corn
flavor
of
which
i
am
not
a
big
fan
the
500

bottle
is
a
chore
to
work
through
this
is
not
a
beer
ill
try
again

russian

it
may
be
unfair
to
say
make
me
nervous
they
always
make
me
think
of
chernobyl
yes
i
know
that
should
make
me
fear
ukrainian
beers
but
i
have
to
admit
that
if
i
had
any
willpower
or
was
even
remotely
concerned
about
standards
i
would
avoid
russianbrewed
libations
like
stalin
avoided
freedom
of
the
press
that
said
tonight
i
poured
myself
and
rather
enjoyed
a
balika
classic
no

nothing
stupendously
exciting
but
not
too
bad
and
it
is
kind
of
cool
to
try
something
other
than
vodka
from
the
worlds
largest
country
500
ml
bottle
with
best
before
june
1
2006
on
the
label
it
pours
into
the
pilsner
glass
a
thin
gold
that
has
a
half
inch
bone
white
head
that
leaves
some
lacing
it
smells
of
adjuncts
dms
grainy
or
toasty
malts
and
maybe
some
corn
husk
and
hops
it
tastes
about
the
same
with
maybe
a
bit
of
fruit
and
a
mild
bitterness
the
body
is
light
to
medium
and
tingly
with
a
short
finish
its
easy
enough
to
drink
but
i
wont
be
seeking
this
one
out
again
drinkable
yes
it
is
what
it
is
a
light
euro
lager
my
wife
and
i
are
planning
a
pierogi
party
and
i
will
be
serving
up
some
eastern
european
brews
this
will
be
one
for
the
newbies
so
yeah
drinkable
but
for
a
session
brew
i
would
get
the
us
standards
at
6
sixers
instead
of
this
one
at
1
70
for
500ml
id
get
bored
of
this
in
a
hurry
this
beer
looks
alright
and
smells
alright
pretty
average
for
what
style
of
beer
this
is
taste
is
pretty
bland
and
fizzy
best
way
to
describe
it
it
tastes
like
nothing
mouthfeel
is
similar
to
that
of
mineral
water
not
offensive
but
nothing
really
to
call
home
about
either
this
beer
however
is
very
easy
to
drink
as
it
goes
down
very
very
easily
like
drinking
a
soda
on
a
hot
day
overall
not
too
bad
but
there
are
better
offerings
available
drinkability
not
offensive
a
little
to
sweet
and
not
very
strong
tasting
ok
this
is
a
pretty
good
international
lager
no
offensive
flavors
and
a
cool
label
worth
a
try
but
nothing
special
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
clean
very
drinkable
and
thirst
quenching
a
good
example
of
a
standard
lager
nothing
earthshattering
but
quite
refreshing
this
is
something
i
could
drink
all
day
outside
watching
a
ball
game

got
off

opinion
i
dont
have
much
to
say
about
this
beer
there
is
nothing
really
special
about
it
except
for
the
fact
that
it
is
clean
and
cheap
it
has
a
better
flavor
than
a
lot
of
macro
brews
but
if
i
were
to
grab
another
beer
it
would
be
something
else

at
once
upon
a
vine
pours
a
clear
golden
straw
color
with
a
rather
tall
and
frothy
head
that
leaves
specks
of
lace
behind
on
the
walls
of
the
glass
as
it
recedes
nose
is
fruity
malts
mostly
apple
along
with
some
grassy
hops
taste
begins
with
a
light
sweetness
followed
by
some
herbal
notes
and
dry
grains
a
mild
peppery
hop
bitterness
comes
across
towards
the
finish
an
average
lagernothing
more
theres
a
biggish
fluffy
pillow
fine
almost
white
lazy
streams
of
carbonation
through
the
clear
pale
gold
beer
the
aroma
is
apples
and
ink
but
its
kind
of
nice
grainsyfruity
front
smooth
full
fruity
buttery
middle
a
little
flabby
not
firm
fresh
fairly
bitter
finish
but
not
really
crisp
its
tasty
a
little
mushy
but
not
bad
i
was
all
set
to
make
a
joke
about
how
baltika
3
was
half
as
good
as
baltika
6
porter
but
that
isnt
the
case
at
all
as
epls
go
its
pretty
good
ive
only
had
a
few
of
their
offerings
so
far
but
if
i
was
russian
id
drink
a
lot
of
baltika
beer
especially
given
what
else
ive
tasted
from
that
neck
of
the
woods
bb
11805
pale
beercolor
and
not
overwelming
but
lasting
head
nose
is
very
papery
oxidised
sweet
malts
and
further
quiet
empty
as
taste
is
oxidised
fatty
acids
sweetish
lowly
bittered
and
very
light
makes
mouthfeel
even
wth
good
carbonisation
not
plesant
and
drinkable
but
one
ill
avoid
in
the
future
the
color
is
standard
for
a
euro
lager
pale
yellow
head
is
bright
white
and
foamy
carbonation
is
very
low
the
aroma
is
the
standard
grainy
sweetness
expected
from
the
style
no
green
bottle
equals
no
skunking
the
taste
has
a
sweet
malt
body
with
a
mild
honeylike
flavor
nice
grain
tastes
and
a
hint
of
saazlike
hops
kick
in
towards
the
middle
of
a
sip
this
is
very
fullflavored
for
the
style
which
makes
baltika
3
a
pleasent
surprize
a
crisp
mouthfeel
gives
this
even
more
cache
drinkability
is
high
i
wish
they
sold
this
in
cheap
12
packs
so
i
could
always
have
a
few
in
the
back
of
my
fridge
especially
during
the
summer
pours
a
yellow
color
with
tiny
head
that
doesnt
stay
and
doesnt
leave
any
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
grassy
and
slightly
skunked
the
flavor
is
really
uninteresting
tastes
like
a
macro
lager
slight
grainy
flavor
with
a
tiny
bit
of
bitterness
has
a
little
caramel
character
as
well
not
really
bad
but
not
too
good
either
doesnt
leave
a
great
aftertaste
its
about
time
i
dranke
this
one
it
pours
a
clear
pale
yellow
color
with
a
2
finger
head
that
falls
to
a
generous
coating
over
the
top
the
nose
is
not
too
bad
slightly
grainey
and
grassy
with
just
a
slight
hint
of
lemon
crispness
the
flavor
is
right
there
as
well
light
grainey
but
not
offensive
slight
grassy
hop
profile
very
clean
the
feel
is
light
to
moderate
at
best
with
an
active
carbonation
drinkability
is
not
all
that
bad
either
this
would
be
very
refeshing
after
some
hard
work
outside
on
a
hot
day
this
is
a
freeway
accident
beer
you
know
move
along
theres
nothing
here
that
concerns
you
i
did
enjoy
baltikas
porter
but
not
this
try
it
if
you
wish
but
ill
pass
on
future
ones
average
macro
style
high
carbonation
thin
bodied
beer
goes
down
just
like
the
rest
but
im
not
a
fan
at
all
an
undistinguished
lager
overall
is
this
the
budweiser
of
russia
actually
goes
down
better
then
bud
otherwise
use
for
drinking
games
only
the
flavor
is
as
the
nose
suggests
with
a
sweet
semigrainy
adjunctenhanced
malt
a
light
touch
of
hop
flavor
and
a
supportive
bitterness
it
finishes
clean
and
dry
with
some
lingering
sweet
malt
and
a
healthy
dose
of
herbal
hoppiness
its
well
done
and
surprisingly
drinkable
considering
its
strength
taste
aftertaste
and
drinkability
at
first
it
tastes
quite
flat
and
watery
on
palate
and
not
any
specific
kind
of
taste
seems
to
dominate
but
later
some
smooth
maltiness
and
mediumdry
hoppyness
are
noticeable
in
the
background
overall
its
a
simple
lightbodied
if
not
too
thin
overly
easydrinking
lager
im
afraid
that
its
not
quite
impressive
if
one
drinks
this
beer
as
the
first
taste
of
russian
products
thin
and
watery
im
afraid
but
thats
what
ive
come
to
expect
form
this
style
pretty
much
every
one
ive
had
tastes
like
your
average
american
macro
lager
the
only
decent
example
of
this
style
ive
found
thus
far
is
sam
smiths
lager
still
its
by
no
means
horrible
in
fact
its
thinness
lends
it
a
certain
drinkability
recommended
only
if
your
bored
andor
you
just
need
something
to
quench
your
thirst
otherwise
dont
bother
drinkability

the
flavor
was
a
bit
off
but
overall
it
was
a
good
drinker
had
a
sample
of
this
beaut
at
the
vintage
cellar
for
the
friday
beer
tasting
they
do
at
any
rate
this
was
a
very
nice
beer
started
out
kind
of
average
nothing
special
was
happening
but
then
a
nice
wheatmalthop
taste
came
about
had
it
at
room
temp
so
i
think
that
helped
its
taste
along
too
very
clean
and
crisp
very
easy
to
drink
would
be
a
very
nice
beer
to
have
a
hot
sunny
day
overall
not
bad
id
still
take
a
german
lager
over
this
but
a
nice
brew
worth
looking
into
last
and
saddest
of
the
10
commie
lagers
at
the
lcbo
pours
a
very
protirelin
hazed
pale
straw
color
small
cap
moderate
lace
aroma
again
with
the
veggies
what
is
this
with
the
ruski
brews
they
got
no
barley
grainy
corn
tastes
weak
body
sweet
fast
finish
no
hops
to
speak
of
bad
beer
leave
it
on
the
shelf
its
obscene
cheap
commie
slop
like
this
retails
for
over
2
dollars
in
canada
draft
st
petersburg
your
standard
issue
beer
for
the
proletariat
on
my
second
sampling
i
find
some
improvements
from
what
i
had
originally
written
though
somewhat
light
in
appearance
but
still
a
pleasing
gold
with
a
thin
lagery
head
the
sugary
taste
i
had
on
my
first
sample
was
absent
the
second
time
around
and
there
was
a
noticable
hop
balance
just
to
counteract
the
malt
with
no
eaxtra
bitterness
to
spare
this
is
the
most
commonly
available
beer
in
st
pete
and
the
brand
that
is
most
active
in
advertising
and
sponsorships
you
can
usually
find
a
portable
baltika
stand
in
front
of
most
railroad
stations
and
several
trolley
stops
with
its
blue
and
white
identifiers
like
drinking
water
with
some
beer
flavorings
added
nothing
interesting
but
at
the
same
time
its
got
a
solid
appearance
and
is
easily
drinkable
even
at
its
lowest
level
no
one
aspect
stood
out
it
was
a
very
mellow
with
a
honey
and
malt
like
taste
overall
not
a
bad
beer
overall
just
an
average
lager
wont
have
again
dont
care
much
for
it
a
beer
with
the
sophistication
of
malt
liquor
the
harshness
of
euro
pils
and
the
price
of
an
import
avoid
it
moderate
straw
color
aroma
was
slightly
bready
with
a
hint
of
oxidation
but
not
enough
to
throw
it
off
very
clean
and
crisp
with
moderate
body
flavor
was
pretty
mainstream
and
conventional
for
a
lager
with
some
light
caramel
malt
flavor
that
tilted
the
balance
ever
so
slightly
to
a
malty
character
finish
was
pleasant
with
sufficient
residual
hops
bittering
not
the
greatest
lager
ive
had
but
any
u
s
macro
would
be
proud
to
turn
out
a
beer
of
this
degree
of
quality
bright
very
clear
pale
yellow
colour
thick
head
of
snowwhite
foam
reduced
within
a
couple
minutes
to
a
moderately
thick
lace
spicy
noble
hop
aroma
with
some
graininess
and
sweetness
some
sharpness
due
to
high
carbonation
with
a
thin
body
sort
of
a
weak
flavour
with
some
spicy
hops
and
malt
sweetness
with
a
slightly
dry
bitter
finish
refreshing
and
light
with
more
flavour
than
your
standard
macro
lager
completely
unremarkable
brew
must
be
the
russian
budweiser
the
beer
pours
a
very
pale
gold
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
pale
malt
scent
with
some
czech
style
hops
and
a
dry
lager
yeast
finish
the
taste
is
average
it
has
a
bland
yet
slightly
malty
flavor
with
a
sweet
yet
dry
finish
it
goes
down
easy
but
it
isnt
as
clean
and
crisp
as
a
german
lager
the
mouthfeel
is
good
it
is
a
lowmedium
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
an
average
beer
nothing
special
it
has
decent
aroma
thats
all
an
all
right
drinking
beer
better
than
bud
not
too
bad

a

dominate
with
a
steely
undertone
also
some

in

taste
is

more
flavor
than

strong
with
the
saaz
hops
with
rusty

and
corn
almost
echoing
the

mouthfeel
is
medium

with
a
lot
of

overall
not
a
bad
beer
good
for
a
hot
day
there
a
better
beers
for
less
money
but
a
decent
one
to
check
out
in
a
sixer
the
bartender
at
the
russian
bar
i
drank
this
at
insisted
that
the
russians
had
just
began
brewing
beer
2
years
ago
and
before
that
it
was
straight
vodka
looking
at
the
average
score
no
one
seems
to
be
vary
impressed
with
this
beer
i
didnt
think
it
was
anything
insanely
good
but
its
certainly
on
par
with
any
european
continental
lager
or
pilsener
i
did
check
the
date
on
the
bottle
whch
was
several
months
away
and
pulled
one
of
the
bottles
way
in
back
on
the
shelf
so
perhaps
i
got
the
best
experience
possible
from
a
beer
about
halfway
around
the
world
its
good
but
with
all
the
other
choices
with
a
nearly
identical
flavor
profile
i
doubt
ill
buy
this
again

nothing

to

it
was
a

not

i
must
commend
it
however
for
having

yes
once

i
have
been

on

the

being

some

took
me
a

to
place
it
overall
though
pretty
tasty
the

isnt
impressive
or
anything
but
the
carbonation
is
there
to
make
the
tongue
happy
enough
really
hits
the
back
of
the
tongue
a
tasty
brew
but
not
really
that
good
of
a
pilsner
this
is
a
standard
lager
everything
about
it
is
standard
not
good
not
bad
just
average
it
sits
rather
yellow
in
the

with
a
large
but
fizzy
head
that
is
gone
before
you
know
it
no
trace

smell
hmm
yeah
i
guess
theres
a
smell
here
reminds
me
of
ballpark
beer
tastes
about
like
that
too
maybe
a
touch
of
rice
the
label
denies
the
presence
of
anything
like
that
with
a
bit
of
carbonation
and
just
the
tiniest
hint
of
hops
if
this
were
all
i
could
drink

still
drink

beer
certainly
better

the
most
popular

sold
in

theres
not
much
to
this
beer
but
it
on
the
dry
side
and
very
clean

if
it
were
half

clear

99
cents
well
spent
notes
not
bad
drinking
at
all
clean
enough
to
enjoy
though
seems
to
be
not
filtered
at
all
so
as
to
hold
on
to
some
raw
flavours
a
perfect
match
with
any
boiled
dinner
beautiful
thick
head
with
great
retention
thats
about
it
light
flat
flavor
with
no
malt
or

bite
after
the
presentation
i
was
very
let
down
by
the
rest
of
the
experience
buena
rubia
estonia
ok
but
nothing
special
this
lager
is
a
nice
golden
color
light
and
bright
with
a
clear
body
and
topped
off
with
a
thick
white
head
the
head
forma
a
billowy
mountaintop
and
you
continue
to
pour
and
the
stream
of
lively
carbonation
slowly
settles
and
disappears
completely
there
is
a
nice
thins
strong
layer
of
lacing
to
mark
every
sip
the
first
aroma
to
hit
you
is
the
malts
followed
by
some
light
grassy
and
lemony
scents
it
sweet
overall
and
very
refreshing
this
is
a
light
bodied
lager
not
much
to
the
taste
but
still
very
refreshing
overall
its
terrible
stuff

pale

the

so
far
have
been
just
crappy
pale
lagers
unfortunately
too
bad
the
6
was
pretty
nice
o
this
beer
is
relatively
easy
to
drink
and
surprisingly
didnt
have
any
skunked
flavors
especially
since
it
came
from
a
clear
glass
bottle
although
there
was
nothing
interesting
about
the
taste
the
feel
isnt
bad
i
expect
a
light
body
and
these
beers
tend
sometimes
to
have
an
odd
slickness
which
this
beer
avoids
its
a
bit
crisp
and
even
has
a
mild
smoothness
to
it
the
taste
brings
out
the
barley
malts
a
bit
more
with
a
standard
clean
lager
hop
finish
drinkable
but
nothing
that
a
hundred
different
pale
lagers
dont
have
overall
uh
dont
bother
if
youre
trying
new
beers
to
sample
dont
bother
if
youre
financially
challenged
but
some
miller
lite
pours
a
slightly
hazy
yellow
with
a
foamy
white
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
tiny
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
and
grain
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
slight
metallic
flavor
on
the
finish
there
is
a
very
mild
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
poor
beer
and
i
think
it
may
have
something
to
do
with
the
clear
bottle
it
comes
in
oeven
for
the
style
its
pretty
bad
so
far
from
this
brewery
this
has
been
my
least
favorite
by
a
long
shot
its
just
not
even
easy
difficult
to
finish
o
lame
and
they
would
like
to
be
part
or
europe
they
obviously
are
still
commies
overall
this
is
very
similar
to
baltika
3
i
havent
done
a
side
by
side
tasting
but
the
similarities
are
remarkable
this
one
may
be
a
little
less
sweet
but
not
much
really
it
isnt
a
bad
beer
just
completely
unremarkable
i
would
pick
up
again
though
overall
despite
clear
glass
this
sample
showed
no
skunkiness
or
others
signs
of
deterioration
it
was
quite
drinkable
but
lacking
in
character
richness
and
complexity
i
e
nothing
to
support
a
recommendation
or
lead
me
to
buy
it
again
out
of
a
bomber
this
beer
was
a
straw
gold
color
with
one
finger
of
head
that
was
rather
short
lived
and
left
very
limited
lacing
consequently
the
aroma
was
of
the
usual
macro
suspects
cereal
grains
and
corn
with
some
pilsner
malt
a
little
bread
and
a
hint
of
must
the
flavors
were
better
than
the
aroma
in
my
opinion
i
tasted
sweet
malt
cereal
grains
a
little
bit
of
yeast
and
hay
as
well
as
a
simple
but
not
unpleasant
note
of
hops
on
the
finish
a
marginal
palate
but
better
than
some
of
the
other
baltika
products
the
mouthfeel
however
was
average
the

mediumlight
and
the
carbonation
on
the
lighter
side
number
5
is
very
light

label
check
bottled
25

11
best
by
25
march
12
so
i
was
in
the
window
and
it
had
probably
been
pasteurized
given
its
clear
bottle
so
what
was
the
problem
mouthfeel
was
on
the
thin
side
and
it
had
a
slightly
minty
flavor
on
the
tongue
along
with
a
mild
lager
sweetness
this
was
quickly
shaping
up
to
be
a

nothin
finish
was
relatively

and
i
really
wished
that
i
had
scored
another
bottle
of

which
actually
was
enjoyable
this
was
not
unpleasant
but
instead
lacking
anything
that
would
make
me
want
to
open
another
overall
not
a
bad
tasting
brew
but
not
interesting
at
all
smooth
finish
but
its

most
lagers
would
not

nothing
really

its

heck
its
beer
dr
a
bland
beer
not
worth
trying
unless
youre
an
obsessive
fanatic
of
the
style
its
not
particularly
easy
to
down
being
more
thick
than
it
ought
to
be
and
the
abv
isnt
that
high
so
its
not
really
even
a
good
option
for
getting
bollocksed
move
along
lads
get
yourself
a
more
worthy

for
less

especially
if
youre
here
in

mouthfeel

overall
this
is
an
ok
lager
as
a
no
frills
warmweather
refreshment
picked
up
a
500ml
can
from
euromart
in
astoria
it
smells
of
pale
malts
with
a
hint
of
honey
and
adjunct
the
flavor
is
similarly
sweet
with
an
odd
vegetal
spice
to
it
honestly
this
beer
reminds
me
of
malt
liquor
more
than
anything
id
avoid
this
one
stick
to
the
baltika
porter
golden
color

white

that
fades

very

a

slight

despite
being
in
a

bottle
no
skunkiness
detected
nothing
altogether
exceptional
but
nothing
really
unlikable
very
easy
to
drink
might
even
try
this
one
again
ps
this
beer
was
all
over
the
place
i
think
this
is
only
the
second
time
in
almost
2000
reviews
that
i
have
five
scores
in
which
no
two
are
the
same
im
not
raving
crazy
mad
over
this
beer
but
im
not
really
disappointed
either
its
just
sort
of
an
average
lager
although
i
wasnt
expecting
it
to
be
so
watered
down
the
9
is
8
alcohol
so
i
was
hoping
maybe
the
5
would
be
too
but
it
tasted
like
beer
flavored
water
really
d
not
my
favorite
baltika
but
its
not
that
bad
nod
good
really
either
pretty
average
pale
gold
colour
thin
white
head
no
lacing
to
speak
of
smells
of
corn
straw
light
hops
and
a
faint
grass
presence
tastes
crips
and
malty
with
a
slight
bitterness
followed
by
a
sugary
sweetness
that
was
unwelcome
thin
to
medium
not
great
though
kind
of
watery
i
finished
my
sample
but
i
would
not
seek
this
out
again
drinkability
well
this
beer
is
alright
but
i
dont
see
myself
buying
it
again
in
the
future
this
beer
would
certainly
be
better
on
a
hot
day
than
on
a
saturday
in
january
but
even
so
there
are
better
examples
of
the
style
bottle
from
an
lcbo
gift
pack
pours
a
pale
yellow
colour
with
small
white
head
almost
no
smell
to
this
though
no
off
smells
either
so
thats
one
up
on
the
baltika
7
prety
grainy
flavour
no
trace
of
hops
or
bitterness
i
suppose
this
could
work
as
a
refreshing
beer
on
a
summer
day
but
why
not
just
buy
a
better
lager
lcbo
same
gift
pack
as
the
7
a
typical
euro
pale
a
little
cheesy
arom
a
light
yellow
colour
with
a
big
soapy
head
a
bit
thin
mouthfeel
malt
sugary
taste
drinkable
but
a
whole
beer
is
not
pleasurable
still
better
than
your
macro
brew
but
not
by
much
almost
literally
baltika
5
is
a
gold
brick
its
an
impostor
of
a
lager
that
doesnt
disguise
even
an
ounce
of
its
adjuncts
and
imitation
ingredients
its
only
about
as
natural
as
a
twinkie
and
twice
as
corrupted
as
the
russian
government
curiously
like
most
anything
you
find
at
a
fast
food
outlet
its
edible
even
strangely
agreeable
but
knowing
whats
in
it
is
a
put
off
and
besides
it
doesnt
come
close
to
comparing
to
the
real
thing
the
beer
pours
a
golden
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
pilsener
malt
with
some
grassy
hops
the
flavor
is
that
of
a
basic
lager
i
get
some
pilsener
malt
some
wheat
lemons
and
grassy
hops
this
tastes
like
a
very
lightly
hopped
pilsener
creamy
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
tastes
of
slight
hops
and
is
pleasantly
malty
as
per
the
style
there
is
not
much
nuance
but
it
tastes
fresh
and
is
remarkably
easy
to
drink
a
nice
change
of
pace
and
very
drinkable
drinkability
nothing
about
this
beer
is
great
but
its
not
really
terrible
either
however
with
a
price
tag
under
2
it
may
be
worth
a
try
even
if
only
once

sweetness

it
a

but
overall
the
mouthfeel
is

thin
this
isnt
an
overly
sweet
beer
but
the
sweetness
stands
out
because
theres
not
much
else
going
on
practically
zero
hops
which
was
expected
due
to
the

is
a
very
clear
very
sparkling
pale
golden
lager
with
a
small
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
and
leaves
decent
lacing
on
the
glass
it
has
a
slightly
sweet
corny
funky
aroma
its
light
bodied
pretty
smooth
and
the
finish
is
pretty
clean
and
dry
its
a
little
watery
and
a
little
gritty
its
a
little
sweet
and
pretty
funky
it
tastes
like
malt
extract
water
and
creamed
corn
but
the
flavor
is
light
keep
it
cold
and
drink
it
quickly
on
my
quest
to
try
all
of
the
baltika
line
poured
5
into
my
tripel
karmeliet
tulip
glass
this
beer
pours
a
crystal
clear
straw
with
a
bright
white
cap
that
leaves
surprisingly
no
lacing
down
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
nose
is
pretty
typical
of
a
euro
pale
big
notes
of
canned
corn
powered
sugar
and
grains
the
flavor
is
really
sweet
but
not
in
a
obnoxious
way
it
reminds
me
of
powdered
sugar
and
sweet
corn
slight
graininess
with
just
a
hint
of
musty
hops
crazy
as
it
is
there
is
absolutely
no
hint
of
skunk
this
bottle
has
probably
been
sitting
on
the
shelve
for
a
while
in
a
clear
bottle
but
no
funk
man
you
put
a
heineken
on
the
shelf
in
front
of
a
tinted
window
for
5
minutes
and
you
start
getting
a
little
funk
i
wonder
if
they
use
some
sort
of
hop
oil
that
doesnt
skunk
like
miller
does
over
all
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
lager
i
would
much
rather
have
one
of
these
then
any
bmc
pretty
much
a
let
down
from
there
skunky
mushroom
nose
corny
and
veggies
and
mushroomsl
cottony
mouthfeel
heavy
handed
and
not
real
good
overall
much
like
the
7
but
not
as
stronga
palate
cleanser
or
a
barbecue
companion
but
no
need
to
purchase
another
now
that
i
have
a
glass
overall
a
very
boring
disappointing
beer
cheers
well
its
certainly
a
euro
lager
not
terrible
but
definitely
not
amazing
good
for
washing
down
the
pizza
i
had
but
thats
about
it
come
on
baltika
only
the
porter
can
save
you
now
effervescent
straw
gold
and
capped
by
a
fluffy
white
head
head
is
well
retained
and
leaves
behind
a
decent
lace
as
it
dissipates
weak
cereal
and
sweet
grain
aroma
this
beers
defining
characteristic
is
a
corn
syrup
sweetness
because
it
actually
is
brewed
with
corn
syrup
it
says
so
on
the
ingredients
list
cloying
tastes
like
sweet
bread
with
hints
of
lemon
and
bittering
hops
light
bodied
with
spritzy
carbonation
feels
a
bit
thin
but
not
watery
offflavours
make
this
one
a
bit
of
a
chore
to
drink
overall
easy
to
drink
in
fact
it
goes
down
so
easy
that
it
could
be
drunk
all
day
not
sure
if
i
would
unless
very
cheap

the
flavour
was
the

as
the
aroma
lots
of
veggies
and
not
much
else
fairly
clean
though
without
a
lot
of
sulfur
or
skunk
light
bodied
with
average
carbonation
fairly
dry
not
bad
but
nothing
here
worth
revisiting
cheers
taste
is
heavy
on
the
wet
grains
and
i
would
be
willing
to
gamble
there
is
some
corn
in
here
as
well
alcohol
is
very
drying
on
the
palate
and
has
a
harsh
edge
to
it
hops
are
virtually
a
noshow
here
but
could
have
provided
some
much
needed
depth
it
does
taste
better
than
it
smells
and
drinks
like
it
is
higher
than

nothing
to
rush
out
and
buy
again
quite
inexpensive
d
this
is
not
very
good
i
can
understand
why
they
imported
stouts
from
england
overall
quite
average
pale
lager
overall
similar
to
the
other
baltika
lagers
probably
the
best
of
the
bunch
it
is
a
nice
diversion
from
american
lagers
if
that
it
your
thing
sometimes
i
like
the
style
for
variety
or
for
something
that
i
perceive
as
lighter
very
clear
bright
yellowgold
appearance
with
little
lacing
or
head
aromas
are
actually
quite
nice
with
a
mix
of
honey
and
grain
however
there
is
somewhat
of
a
sticky
aspect
to
the
smell
making
the
aromas
lag
in
your
nose
to
a
nuisance
amount
of
time
very
very
sweet
somewhat
syrupy
aftertaste
on
the
tongue
with
a
really
strong
honey
flavor
mouthfeel
is
very
watery
and
thank
goodness
the
sweetness
from
this
drink
could
have
been
much
more
potent
if
it
were
not
watered
down
overall
quite
a
nice
drink
for
your
sweet
tooth
just
another
pale
lager
to
be
forgotten
in
the
sea
of
this
ubiquitous
style
d
it
isnt
offensive
but
there
is
a
big
lack
of
flavor
here
no
problems
getting
through
this
but
it
is
boring
and
uninspiring
certainly
not
baltikas
best
nikki
d
drink
cold
and
from
the
bottle
and
this
stuff
will
be
gone
before
you
know
it
d
this
is
a
very
light
beer
similar
to
an
american
lite
beer
with
just
a
hint
of
hops
not
really
worth
the
effort
of
prying
the
cap
off
the
bottle
taste
is
crisp
grain
some
malt
few
hops
some
lemon
ends
dry
with
a
touch
of
bitterness
drinkability
good
heavens
no
but
its
not
altogether
terrible
for
being
just
a
simple
pale
lager
presentation
packaged
in
an
11
2
ounce
clear
glass
longneck
bottle
with
a
twistoff
crown
served
in
a
standard
pint
tap
glass
in
an
apparent
effort
to
conform
to
the
texas
alcoholic
beverage
commissions
byzantine
regulations
a
small
label
reading
ale
has
been
affixed
to
the
label
this
is
a
very
simple
direct
lager
with
little
complexity
and
a
downright
ugly
appearance
i
cant
say
its
terrible
but
it
isnt
all
that
tasty
either
its
about
as
average
as
a
beer
can
be
and
if
it
wasnt
for
the
low
price
i
doubt
many
would
take
this
beer
seriously
d
5
is
surprisingly
easy
to
drink
its
nice
and
light
with
a
pretty
decent
taste
that
goes
down
smooth
overall
not
a
bad
beer
d
now
this
beer
isnt
terrible
just
strange
almost
a
liquorice
beer
grapeflavored
water
beer
dudes
very
easy
to
drink
very
refreshing
nothing
offensive
but
very
boring
not
a
wreck
but
with
enough
minor
flaws
and
irritants
and
lack
of
anything
notable
to
put
it
in
the
typical
euro
pale
lager
range

ubd
no
wonder
theyre
so
cheap
this
one
poured
a
nice
golden
color
but
w
a
nonexistant
head
no
lacing
either
has
a
macro
lager
nose
w
a
slight
hop
aroma
might
be
skunked
a
bit
too
though
a
faint
malt
flavor
comes
through
a
mostly
winey
adjunct
malt
profile
but
a
not
too
unpleasing
balance
w
the
underlying
hop
taste
blending
in
a
bit
at
the
end
a
light
bodied
semi
flat
mouthfeel
w
some
dextrins
added
prob
a
poor
rep
of
this
one
due
to
the
age
but
if
ab
put
this
out
id
prob
drink
more
american
macro
beers
pours
a
very
clear
yellow
color
nice
head
that
faded
quick
no
lacing
smell
is
mostly
alcohol
grains
a
little
sweetness
pretty
light
on
smell
taste
is
about
the
same
just
a
touch
of
sweetness
towards
the
end
mouthfeel
is
thin
but
its
crisp
and
smooth
and
i
could
see
this
tasting
good
on
a
hot
day
salud
pours
out
gold
with
moderate
bubbles
and
a
thinnish
head
looks
about
right
smell
starts
off
rather
malty
but
then
quickly
switches
to
a
grainy
cornlike
aroma
some
whiffs
of
rubber
bands
flavor
brings
more
of
a
malty
backbone
than
in
the
smell
but
there
is
still
the
underlying
corn
and
rubber
band
thing
there
mouthfeel
is
light
and
fizzy
yeah
i
dont
think
id
choose
this
over
baltikas
porter
again
kinda
bad
even
for
the
weakass
epl
category
given
how
generally
inoffensive
it
is
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
them
id
rather
not
but
i
could
drinkability
for
what
it
is
very
light
and
boring
its
fairly
refreshing
there
really
isnt
much
to
say
about
this
beer
not
much
taste
and
what
is
there
isnt
very
appealing
there
are
better
beers
in
this
style
not
very
good
people
thumbs
down
to
team
red
its
held
up
pretty
well
in
the
year
since
it
was
made
but
i
cant
imagine
it
was
too
great
to
start
with
probably
better
fresh
but
not
much
better
clear
yellow
gold
small
foamy
white
head
looks
like
a
macro
nose
is
metallic
corn
with
a
slight
sweetness
maybe
a
tiny
bit
of
hops
taste
is
a
bit
skunky
possibly
a
bad
bottle
like
old
moldy
corn
in
a
metal
bin
mouthfeel
is
just
ok
as
is
drinkability
along
with
7
this
is
at
the
bottom
of
the
baltika
scale
could
possibly
be
related
to
limited
shelflife
due
to
being
the
only
baltika
with
a
clear
bottle
gold
was
the
loser
of
the
baltika
challenge
which
involved
drinking
all
the
available
baltikas
poured
golden
surprize
with
an
offwhite
foamy
head
very
corny
odor
like
a
malt
liquor
metallic
odor
too
a
bit
sour
kind
of
malty
and
corny
taste
nothing
special
a
little
unpleasant
thin
easy
to
drink
but
not
all
that
fun
to
do
so
baltika
5
golden
lager
is
a
worthy
member
of
the
brewerys
lineup
despite
being
less
than
outstanding
beer
on
those
rare
occasions
okay
nonexistent
occasions
when
i
have
a
hankering
for
a
euro
pale
lager
i
know
that
pivzavod
baltika
will
deliver
the
goods
more
often
than
not
well
the
bottle
was
shinny
but
thats
about
the
only
good
thing
i
have
to
say
about
baltika
5
in
fact
i
think
i
am
going
to
burn
the
pint
glass
i
poured
it
in
ok
well
maybe
it
wasnt
that
bad
but
it
certainly
wasnt
very
good
either
i
was
given
this
beer
and
i
use
that
term
losely
by
my
boss
since
the
company
i
work
for
is
thinking
about
selling
it
as
far
as
im
concerned
as
a

i

caveat

thin
lizzy
johnny
the

borderlinerather
appropriate
really
too
damn
sweet
try
this
if
you
have
the
guts
otherwise
stear
clear
notes
ive
been
a
backer
of
some
offerings
from
this
brewery
but
they
fall
short
this
time
this
beer
pours
a
golden
yellow
color
with
one
finger
of
white
head
nothing
terribly
exciting
about
the
appearance
unless
you
count
a
bottle
cap
in
cyrillic
quite
average
fairly
average
smell
too
weak
malt
and
it
seemed
a
bit
sweet
to
me
as
well
it
tastes
like
many
other
of
the
more
easily
available
euro
pale
lagers
out
there
but
amazingly
it
had
no
skunk
quite
surprising
for
a
beer
in
a
clear
bottle
specifically
its
a
bit
sweet
and
is
very
smooth
the
mouthfeel
is
alright
pretty
light
and
a
bit
watery
the
carbonation
is
good
however
this
beer
is
quite
drinkable
at
least
if
you
want
something
boring
and
fairly
bland
if
you
want
to
have
a
really
good
russian
beer
id
recommend
the
baltika
6
porter
the
beer
pours
a
pale
gold
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
average
it
has
a
weak
pale
malt
scent
along
with
a
dry
lager
yeast
aroma
its
a
bit
musty
and
bitter
the
taste
is
average
as
well
it
has
the
standard
pale
malt
and
lager
yeast
taste
its
light
and
clean
on
the
finish
an
easy
drinker
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
it
is
a
low
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
typical
golden
lager
nothing
special
i
will
probably
save
my
money
or
buy
something
else
next
time
not
much
to
say
about
this
one
because
ive
had
so
many
standard
lagers
during
my
visit
to
russia
each
one
as
bland
as
the
one
before
this
is
pretty
nice
but
its
pretty
standard
tostyle
stuff
decenet
pale
straw
color
light
head
but
the
taste
just
says
ive
been
down
this
road
before
pours
a
slightly
hazy
very
pale
straw
amber
with
a
short
white
head
which
quits
tastes
sweet
but
is
almost
crisp
not
hopy
or
malty
a
very
simple
brew
which
does
quench
a
thirst
not
amoung
the
better
lagers
produceded
but
still
better
than
your
average
american
macrobrew
not
the
best
from
baltic
but
not
the
worst
either
try
some
other
numbers
nothing
great
here
turned
out
to
be
better
than
expected
actually
this
one
pours
a
very
light
gold
almost
rolling
rockesque
smells
of
malt
anf
grain
though
nothing
overpowering
here
one
might
just
assume
they
were
taking
a
whiff
of
a
glass
of
water
it
delivers
a
surprising
smooth
taste
with
hints
of
flavour
but
nothing
overpowering
still
a
bit
too
watery
for
my
liking
i
guess
i
might
drnk
this
one
again
i
cant
recommend
it
but
cant
say
stay
away
either
my
canned
version
poured
a
nice
golden
color
with
a
small
head
that
lost
no
time
in
disappearing
lace
forget
about
it
smell
not
really
the
mouthfeel
is
fizz
with
just
a
touch
of
malt
the
taste
is
pretty
neutral
maybe
a
touch
of
sweetness
and
a
dab
of
fruit
a
bit
of
hops
comes
out
a
little
bit
later
but
only
if
you
are
trying
real
hard
to
find
it
this
is
drinkable
stuff
if
nothing
else
is
around
but
baltika
can
and
does
do
much
better
this
is
the
second
beer
ive
tried
from
baltika
and
i
believe
that
its
the
better
of
the
two
although
the
beer
has
a
thin
head
and
a
lackluster
appearance
gold
but
slightly
hazy
and
not
quite
appealing
it
makes
up
for
it
in
taste
a
flavorful
maltiness
makes
the
beer
stand
out
its
a
little
oily
and
has
a
slightly
metallic
characteristic
but
i
enjoyed
it
overall
pretty
ordinary
tasteless
bollocks
far
too
low
in
carbonation
to
bring
the
flavours
through
well
au45
a
case
is
too
high
not
great
its
a
fine
beer
for
sure
i
dont
know
if
it
warrants
a
repeat
purchase
but
its
a
decent
sip
on
a
hot
day
overall
i
think
you
could
drink
a
good
46
of
these
without
much
complaints
not
very
complex
but
a
very
drinkable
lager
o
not
a
bad
beer
just
reminds
me
of
a
typical
euro
lager
nonoffensive
probably
best
on
a
hot
summer
day
overall
a
refreshing
euro
pale
lager
from
coopers
excellent
malt
flavours
made
this
stand
out
from
others
in
the
style
i
could
see
this
as
a
session
brew
especially
on
a
hot
aussie
beach
worth
giving
a
try
overall
3
55
better
than
your
average
american
big
business
lager
but
still
not
for
me
not
that
great
there
are
a
lot
of
beers
out
there
arent
there
poured
a
2
12
white
soap
suds
head
which
faded
fast
clear
light
straw
yellow
color
smells
of
corn
and
grass
and
is
utterly
bmc
to
me
taste
matches
the
smell
theres
slightly
a
little
more
hops
to
it
than
an
american
lager
version
but
truly
if
you
swap
an
americans
beer
for
this
one
in
a
blind
taste
test
i
dont
think
most
people
would
notice
the
difference
food
match
im
having
a
chicken
inverted
commas
because
its
really
faux
chicken
burger
and
i
would
pair
this
beer
with
a
chicken
or
real
chicken
burger
any
day
of
the
week
except
friday
thats
fish
day
liked
this
for
what
it
is
simple
clean
beer
no
tricks
or
funky
ingredients
good
for
the
grill
pizza
or
by
itself
overall
this
is
a
good
lager
with
more
bad
than
good
qualities
in
fact
there
isnt
anything
bad
about
this
beer
its
slightly
above
average
it
is
good
for
savoring
a
finger
of
rocky
bonewhite
head
from
the
pour
color
was
a
pale
lemonyellow
with
nequality
clarity
nose
was
very
light
with
a
slight
malt
essence
coming
through
but
virtually
nonexistent
mouthfeel
was
mediumtofull
with
a
light
slight
bittersweet
taste
of
lager
on
the
tongue
finish
was
likewise
clean
crisp
and
unobtrusive
frankly
it
struck
me
as
being
a
bit
bland
come
on
lads
i
know
yinz
can
do
better
than
this
give
it
a
fullon
hohum
zzzz
this
lager
poured
out
much
like
most
lagers
do
its
got
a
clear
yellow
color
with
a
fizzy
white
head
on
top
the
head
fades
and
doesnt
leave
much
in
way
of
lacing
at
all
the
smell
of
the
beer
has
a
typical
earthy
hopped
grassy
aroma
to
it
the
taste
has
a
nice
balance
of
malt
and
hops
the
mouthfeel
leaves
you
mouth
feeling
dry
and
somewhat
refreshing
overall
this
beer
was
good
when
i
had
it
i
would
like
to
say
id
drink
it
again
if
i
came
across
it
one
day
in
the
future
i
havent
had
this
one
in
a
few
years
so
i
would
be
a
nice
one
to
revisit
sometime
this
one
has
a
primo
beer
price
but
does
not
deliver
the
good
maybe
its
just
not
what
i
like
for
this
style
the
all
malt
claim
on
the
label
is
indeed
difficult
to
refute
this
offering
has
robust
grainy
noadjunct
sweetness
in
spades
however
it
could
likewise
do
well
to
exhibit
more
than
a
bit
of
crisp
offsetting
hops
though
that
may
just
be
an
artifact
of
the
time
and
space
expended
for
me
to
get
my
hands
on
this
being
so
far
from
the
source
i
liked
this
ok
but
i
would
like
to
give
this
a
shot
a
little
closer
to
the
source
as
i
imagine
a
crossglobal
trek
takes
its
toll
on
a
beer
atmosphere
is
pretty
good
really
solid
appearance
great
head
lots
of
lacing
nose
is
simple
but
a
good
representation
of
the
style
a
little
yeast
citrus
and
spice
flavor
is
yeasty
with
a
nice
balance
of
sweet
and
savory
components
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
quaff
if
you
find
a
newer
bottle
give
it
a
try
if
not
i
cannot
recommend
this
beer
at
all
d
very
easy
to
drink
but
nothing
impressive
usual
decent
body
with
zesty
carbonation
and
overall
is
very
drinkable
good
stuff
a
cloudy
golden
allmalt
lager
here
with
substantial
lacing
and
a
very
sweet
yeasty
nose
up
front
flavor
is
crisp
but
not
at
all
complex
really
an
average
lager
with
no
evidence
of
hoppiness
to
counterbalance
the
malty
sweetness
drinkable
but
definitely
not
impressive
drinkability
refreshing
brew
a
great
nononsense
lager
drinkability
is
easy
with
the
undetectable
5
alcohol
content
its
worth
trying
if
you
dont
mind
the
relatively
high
price
for
a
lager
d
this
is
a
great
looking
beer
but
otherwise
pretty
midle
of
the
road
the
lightness
and
low
abv
make
it
a
good
compliment
to
a
warm
day
overall
id
say
its
an
average
beer
dont
go
out
of
your
way
to
buy
it
it
is
hard
to
find
and
it
not
cheap
if
you
come
across
it
some
place
id
say
try
it
its
an
interesting
exotic
lager
but
its
not
a
remarkable
beer
notes
overall
it
is
a
very
basic
lager
that
is
clean
and
easy
to
drink
on
a
hot
day
however
5
bucks
a
pop
at
the
outback
steakhouse
is
way
overpriced
for
this
style

beer

is
also
barley
and
a
slight
metallic
taste
as
well
as
some
skunkiness
light
and
thin
texture
weak
body
flavor
is
average
not
a
bad
beer
to
drink
all

but
not
very
exciting
i
found
that
although
it
is
a
step
or
so
above
most
us
macro
lagers
i
would
never
get
it
the
macros
are
cheaper
and
more
refreshing
and
the
rest
are
better
or
more
interesting

with
no

of
a
clean
lager
and
a
little
malt
definitely
fits
the
style
not
so
smooth
due
to
the
high
carbonation
but
a
crisp
mouthfeel
tastes
of
fullbodied
lager
with
a
sweet
malt
background
one
of
the
better
lagers
ive
had
the
chance
to
rate
worth
a
try
pours
a
very
clean
golden
color
with
a
lot
of
initial
carbonation
very
little
head
and
no

nice
clean
and
crisp

very
malty

with
nice
hoppy

at
the
end

goes

even
better

d
average
drinkability
overall
1
or

is
enough
a
one
sitting
wouldnt
consider
this
a
session
but
was
big
and
bold
in
flavor
thought
not
particularly
crisp
per
style
typical
pale
blonde
look
with
a
little
more
tint
to
it
the
head
holding
up
adequately
aroma
is
grassy
and
haylike
with
drying
husk
at
the
end
of
the
note
its
a
simple
clean
refreshing
lager
with
a
more
enriched
maltiness
than
other
plain
lagers
snappy
bite
of
carbonation
tingles
the
tip
of
the
tongue
as
its
in

mouth
this
lager
is
right
on
the
mark
for
the
style
some
foam
on
the
pour
but
dies
to
a
slim
ring
decent
taste
no
off
flavours
basic
corn
and
arcade
game
overall
a
decent
pale
lager
that
is
probably
better
with
a
side
of
bloomin
onion
perhaps
probably
a
lot
better
in
australia
but
i
think
the
long
trip
hurts
this
one
not
coopers
best
yet
certainly
a
good
stab
at
the
style
nonetheless
d
quite
drinkable

ive
had
this

will

is
about
what
you
would
expect
for
a
pale
lager
its
slightly
corny
with
a
mildly
bitter

it
doesnt
present
a
hoppy
bitterness

just
a
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
but
nothing
off
putting
mouthfeel

highly
carbonated
coopers
premium
lager
is
definitely
a
yard
beer
on
a
hot
day
playing
around
in
the
yard
with
some
friends
this
would
be
a
perfect
beer
taste
was
a
bit
bitter
the
beer
was
a
deep
yellow
the
smell
was
very
grainy
had
a
small
sudsy
head
the
mouthfeel
was
sort
of
an
oily
feel
to
the
tongue
all
and
all
the
tast
wasnt
anything
impressive
but
it
wasnt
bad
either
had
this
with
some
aussie
cheese
fries
and
some
ahi
tuna
at
outback
d
nothing
too
exciting
worth
a
try
if
you
happen
to
see
it
but
any
shop
that
bothers
stocking
this
probably
has
better
choices
pours
light
to
medium
golden
with
a
decent
amount
of
white
head
that
lasts
for
a
bit
smell
is
a
mix
of
slight
skunk
along
with
typical
lager
yeast
and
a
bit
of
malt
smells
taste
has
a
little
bitterness
up
front
with
a
smoother
creamier
finish
and
a
small
aftertaste
all
in
all
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
and
is
pretty
drinkable
if
its
readily
available
in
your
area
it
may
be
worth
a
try
but
it
certainly
isnt
too
unique
i
thought
malt
d
i
could
easily
drink
a
few
of
these
in
the
summer
time
while
cooking
on
the
grill
or
working
in
the
yard
just
a
real
refreshing
lager
nothing
stellar
but
a
pretty
sold
entry
drinkability
refreshing
brew
a
great
nononsense
lager
pretty
much
what
you
get
in
lagers
from
any
place
in
the
world
that
gets
hot
watery
and
thirst
quenching
pretty
much
this
is
a
lawnmowing
moment
type
of
beer
nothing
much
outstanding
or
bad
about
it
presentation
packaged
in
a
short
twelveounce
brown
glass
bottle
with
a
twistoff
crown
served
in
a
standard
pint
tap
glass
pours
a
pale
golden
color
with
a
very
thin
head
of
foam
aroma
is
mostly
malty
with
some
fruitiness
in
the
nose
taste
is
somewhat
syrupy
and
malty
with
a
mild
bitterness
aftertaste
is
somewhat
bready
other
than
that
there
are
not
many
other
flavors
i
can
detect
in
this
lager
i
would
put
it
slightly
below
average
as
i
have
had
better
examples
of
this
style
had
a
dark
strawish
color
with
a
light
white
head
that
did
lace
but
dissipated
pretty
quickly
the
smell
was
pretty
pleasing
as
well
with
touches
of
oats
and
honey
and
when
i
took
the
first
sip
it
had
a
bit
of
a
kick
it
definitely
isnt
what
i
expected
when
i
took
that
sip
as
it
had
nearly
no
carbonation
left
probably
due
to
aging
but
id
definitely
give
this
another
drink
although
i
wouldnt
search
it
out
overall
a
nice
lager
and
one
of
the
better
ones
in
its
style
imo
but
i
am
not
one
that
would
seek
this
out
any
as
nothing
about
it
is
too
special
is
highly
drinkable
though
if
looking
for
an
easy
drinking
pale
lager
that
isnt
watery
d
not
one
i
would
want
to
revisit
left
me
a
bit
bloated
just
not
the
best
lager
for
sessions
w
its
high
carbonation
and
lackluster
flavor
a
slightly
better
than
average
euro
pale
lager
the
quality
is
good
like
all
coopers
beers
but
this
is
no
where
near
as
tasty
as
most
of
the
rest
of
their
offerings
it
was
pretty
cheap
so
id
consider
buying
it
for
a
party
as
it
is
better
than
most
macros
for
my
own
drinking
though
ill
pass
on
this
one
a
try
expect
an
okay
lawnmower
brew
pours
a
bright
golden
color
with
a
decent
amount
of
bubbly
white
head
that
takes
a
while
to
fade
and
clings
to
the
glass
all
the
way
down
smells
very
faintly
of
yeast
and
not
much
else
the
taste
is
very
clean
not
very
malty
but
there
is
some
sweetness
there
theres
some
hoppy
bitterness
just
enough
to
balance
out
the
sweetness
the
mouthfeel
is
tingly
and
heavy
pretty
good
for
a
lager
overall
a
very
drinkable
lager
one
of
the
better
aussie
lagers
overall
a
rather
lackluster
lager
but
certain
a
step
above
australias
other
infamous
beer
fosters
overall
its
hardly
worthy
of
acclaimed
mention
but
it
does
battle
against
some
of
the
better
mainstream
lagers
with
pride
the
best
part
about
this
beer
is
the
way
it
looks
in
the
glass
pours
like
a
picture
very
nice
the
smell
is
kind
of
what
youd
expect
from
a
euro
lager
except
a
little
cleaner
tasting
comparing
this
to
other
beers
that
shall
remain
nameless
in
their
green
bottles
this
is
damn
tasty
you
really
have
to
rate
on
style
here
and
stylewise
this
is
pretty
good
id
never
really
seen
this
beer
before
so
i
wasnt
too
sure
on
its
rep
but
id
try
it
again
if
i
was
in
the
mood
for
the
style
the
beer
pours
a
nice
gold
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
crisp
clean
and
refreshing
pale
malt
scent
that
along
with
light
fruity
yeast
esters
the
taste
is
good
also
it
has
a
smooth
pale
malt
flavor
that
goes
down
easy
and
refreshes
its
clean
in
the
finish
along
with
some
light
hops
as
well
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
low
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
good
drinking
lager
and
probably
the
best
beer
ive
had
from
these
guys
its
nothing
special
but
it
does
the
trick
this
beer
poured
a
clear
yellow
with
a
inch
rocky
head
the
aroma
is
mostly
of
hops
with
slight
malt
sweetness
evident
the
taste
is
bitter
and
sweet
from
the
malt
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
to
medium
bodied
crisp
overall
this
is
a
refreshing
lager
that
id
definitely
consider
drinkable
overall
impression
a
well
executed
lager
clean
basic
lacking
any
real
flaws
you
could
do
worse
but
so
much
better
best
thing
was
the
pour

lite
straw
yellow
with
a
dinky
white
head
on
an
easy
pour
decent
head
if
aggressively
poured
sweet
cooked
veggies
in
the
aroma
mixed
with
molasses
in
the
taste
a
funky
vinous
aspect
creeps
in
along
the
way
dry
and
woody
in
the
finish
ugh
beer
d
a
little
tasty
doesnt
go
down
too
easily
not
very
filling
i
really
didnt
like
this
beer
very
much
and
would
drink
it
again
if
there
were
much
else
to
choose
from
overall
an
easy
drinking
lager
nothing
all
that
noteworthy
however
notes
ive
been
impressed
with
coopers
brewing
and
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
the
extra
stout
was
very
good
as
well
a
little
below
average
with
some
slightly
harsh
flavors
drinkability
curious
not
really
endearing
enough
for
me
to
seek
out
i
dont
know
what
sort
of
reputation
coopers
brewery
limited
has
in
australia
if
its
good
i
doubt
that
premium
lager
is
responsible
as
far
as
im
concerned
best
extra
stout
is
the
only
one
of
their
beers
that
warrants
a
second
purchase
this
is
a
very
smooth
and
crisp
lager
goes
down
very
well
and
recomended
d
decent
enough
lager
would
be
very
drinkable
were
it
not
for
the
price
overall
this
is
a
very
drinkable
lager
with
a
very
firm
hop
presence
i
will
be
buying
more
of
this
overall
impression
decent
lager
but
nothing
too
exciting
at
least
this
one
is
actually
australian
unlike
the
everpresent
fosters
not
a
bad
little
macro
lager
but
unchallenging
in
all
aspects
it
did
pour
beautifully
with
a
thick
creamy
white
head
that
made
the
beer
look
wonderful
hops
utilization
was
a
distinct
pride
of
ringwood
but
only
a
tiny
amount
if
you
like
fosters
but
want
a
beer
with
a
little
less
of
the
aluminum
flavor
then
give
coopers
a
try
drinkability
of
course
its
a
drinkable
non
offending
easy
to
have
more
than
one
beer
but
at
4
25
a
bottle
this
is
not
that
special
i
had
this
because
i
wanted
to
try
something
different
but
at
that
price
ill
force
down
the
big
fosters
taste
is
light
as
expected
from
this
style
with
a
predominantly
malt
taste
and
a
slightly
hoppier
finish
making
for
an
excellent
mouthfeelexperience
from
start
to
finish
very
drinkable
session
beer
and
overall
nice
example
of
a
lager
poured
from
a
12
7
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
poured
a
light
yellow
forming
a
thick
2
inch
head
that
left
very
slight
lacing
on
the
glass
once
it
faded
not
much
in
the
nose
but
what
is
detectable
is
very
much
like
any
of
the
light
lagers
from
the
big
3
the
mouthfeel
is
light
like
a
lager
should
be
the
taste
is
alot
better
than
your
average
lager
imho
very
clean
finish
making
this
an
easy
beer
to
session
especially
on
a
hot
summer
day
im
not
a
big
drinker
of
lagers
but
this
one
was
very
enjoyable
pours
a
clear
golden
yellow
color
nice
carbonation
small
head
not
bad
lacing
around
the
edges
scents
of
hops
malts
slight
yeast
and
spices
the
taste
is
hoppymalty
nice
clean
finish
lightmedium
body
not
a
bad
lager
at
all
would
recommend
but
most
likely
will
not
buy
again
a
singlel
bottle
at
dan
murphy
only
cost
2
aud
so
its
good
value
imho
it
is
a
cut
above
most
regular
australian
lagers
and
whilst
not
achieving
any
complex
heights
seems
to
be
a
drinkable
session
lager
not
bad
refreshing
and
straightforward
one
of
the
better
examples
of
gluten
free
beer
it
is
very
good
and
is
perfect
for
an
afternoon
palate
this
is
a
light
bodied
brew
with
moderate
carbonation
not
terrible
but
there
are
better
beers
out
there
yes
5s
all
round
when
a
beer
drinker
gets
diagnosed
as
gluten
intolerant
its
a
rather
large
downer
condemned
to
drink
wine
spirits
and
cider
for
ever
this
beer
is
a
godsend
love
it
being
a
celiac
in
indianapolis
this
is
the
closest
thing
to
beer
as
youre
going
to
find
growing
up
in
milwaukee
wisconsin
and
only
recently
discovering
my
gluten
intolerance
this
beer
is
a
godsend
if
you
can
drink
normal
beer
i
can
see
how
itd
be
a
3
but
here
in
indy
its
a
5
brilliant
gold
in
color
with
a
fingernail
of
eggshell
white
excellent
clarity
and
light
lacing
heavy
aroma
of
corn
with
a
hint
of
skunkiness
the
flavor
is
corn
on
the
front
of
the
palate
and
then
a
familiar
well
water
edge
from
what
i
think
is
danish
lager
yeast
takes
over
the
mouth
is
thin
and
watery
mouthfeel
light
body
not
quite
crisp
enough
for
my
taste
mouthfeel
nothing
unusual
or
significant
to
report
golden
color
small
white
head
aroma
of
grain
with
hint
of
fruits
and
grass
taste
is
malty
sweet
with
specific
light
sourness
bitterness
in
finish
and
and
aftertaste
o
if
you
wouldve
told
me
this
was
below
the
gluten
threshold
i
wouldve
went
oh
tastes
like
a
fine
malty
everyman
lager
to
me
preferable
alternative
to
the
slough
of
sorghum
beverages
that
still
mostly
fail
to
taste
like
cerveza
o
it
s
actually
not
bad
i
was
expecting
something
horribly
and
am
pleasantly
surprised
that
said
it
is
not
a
great
beer
it
is
better
than
an
adjunct
lager
so
celiac
disease
sufferers
can
enjoy
that
a
wellmade
but
ultimately
not
very
interesting
euro
lager
this
compares
favorably
to
some
others
in
the
style
but
its
nothing
i
would
ever
go
out
of
my
way
for
or
feel
the
need
to
try
again
not
overly
expensive
considering
the
novelty
of
gluten
free
5
99
for
a
4pack
for
me
at
local
big
liquourbeerwine
chain
specs
thats
under
13
centsounce
which
puts
it
in
range
of
most
craft
beers
pours
a
mediumpale
straw
yellow
color
with
a
thick
foamy
head
the
aroma
primarily
features
sweet
bready
malts
with
only
a
small
contribution
from
a
must
european
hop
profile
the
flavor
is
likewise
sweet
and
grainy
with
bready
malts
up
front
and
a
more
earthy
bitterness
dominating
the
finish
there
is
a
fine
sharp
carbonation
but
the
beer
feels
a
little
heavy
for
the
style
overall
this
is
more
flavorful
than
most
euro
lagers
but
it
is
still
not
something
to
go
to
often
o
good
drinkability
standard
euro
lager
ive
bought
this
beer
because
i
suspect
that
im
intolerant
to
gluten
and
coincidentally
ill
be
making
blood
exams
this
week
to
figure
this
out
interesting
enough
im
feeling
quite
well
after
drinking
this
one
not
because
its
a
good
beer
but
because
i
have
the
impression
the
the
exams
will
confirm
my
suspicions
in
this
case
i
feel
happy
that
i
can
count
with
this
sort
of
initiative
overall
this
ins
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
lager
much
better
than
my
expectations
based
on
some
other
review
i
would
really
like
to
drink
this
one
again
o
meh
probably
will
not
have
again
unless
in
spain
which
i
dont
see
happening
in
the
near
future
as
gluten
free
beers
go
i
like
this
one
still
has
the
flavor
of
barley
not
sorghum
or
some
other
brutal
sugar
however
as
regular
pale
lagers
go
this
is
pretty
bad
its
over
the
top
sweet
and
even
with
its
very
pale
golden
color
it
drinks
like
a
glass
of
molasses
way
too
much
residual
sweet
here
it
kills
any
subtle
malt
flavors
and
makes
all
the
jovial
carbonation
for
naught
almost
tastes
like
a
wheat
malt
base
light
and
floral
a
little
it
is
similar
to
the
mother
beer
the
regular
damm
which
i
liked
quite
a
lot
for
what
it
is
this
one
lacks
the
cleanness
in
the
finish
that
made
the
other
one
so
great
the
sweetness
hangs
around
and
the
beer
feels
heavy
as
a
result
still
for
the
gluten
free
folks
out
there
i
would
recommend
this
only
because
there
are
so
few
good
options
for
you
omission
pale
ale
still
ranks
as
the
best
gluten
free
brew
ive
had
hands
down
this
does
avoid
the
usual
macro
euro
metallic
malt
vibe
though
which
is
a
great
service
to
itself
and
its
consumers
this
is
the
best
tasting
gulten
beer
i
have
ever
had
taste
more
of
a
apa
like
a
heny
weinhard
but
i
love
it
a
good
beer
good
beer
color
so
if
you
neeed
a
gulten
beer
drink
this
and
even
if
you
dont
drink
this
you
wont
be
disappionted
this
beer
makes
me
happy
so
enjoy
one
of
the
better
examples
of
gluten
free
beer
ok
an
average
lagerpilsner
with
no
ill
effects
by
being
gluten
free
this
is
a
simple
beer
and
honestly
not
in
a
style
im
a
huge
fan
of
this
is
one
of
the
worst
among
those
for
which
i
have
paid
more
than
2
00beer
it
has
a
terrible
metallic
taste
that
is
also
overly
sweet
it
tastes
of
adjunct
and
aside
from
pouring
with
a
large
head
and
a
nice
bottle
design
it
is
no
better
and
actually
worse
than
most
macro
beers
i
can
get
from
a
gas
station
it
has
a
sticky
mouthfeel
overall
save
your
money
unless
youre
looking
for
an
offense
smelling
lager
that
tastes
like
corn
syrup
and
the
bottle
that
it
comes
in
o
as
a
gluten
free
beer
way
more
body
than
i
thought
before
nice
bitter
hops
but
a
buttery
feel
affects
the
rating
in
a
bad
way
the
finger
of
rocky
fluffy
bonewhite
head
looked
like
meringue
atop
the
beer
as
it
slowly
fell
like
a
souffle
color
was
a
pale
lemonyellow
with
neplus
quality
clarity
nose
was
redolent
with
saaz
hops
not
skunk
as
one
previous
reviewer
misidentified
it
it
had
a
really
nice
grassiness
to
it
without
being
ruined
with
adjuncts
and
believe
me
i
am
able
to
spot
the
difference
at
this
point
mouthfeel
was
soft
lightly
carbonated
with
a
grassy
slightly
metallic
taste
on
the
tongue
finish
was
semidry
and
definitely
lagerlike
in
its
mild
unobtrusiveness
i
will
not
say
that
it
was
the
best
example
of
the
style
that
i
have
ever
tried
but
its
glutenfree
status
makes
it
highly
recommendable
to
anyone
that
has
that
as
a
concern
it
was
decent
but
it
could
be
good
under
the
right
circumstances
overall
for
a
mild
celiac
this
is
a
dream
beer
in
the
lager
realm
im
going
to
have
to
say
in
that
arena
its
in
the
high
3s
poured
from
a
33cl
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
a
date
of
813
on
the
back
this
pours
a
light
golden
color
with
a
mid
sized
off
white
head
the
smells
are
of
light
malts
light
hops
a
little
adjuncts
the
feel
is
medium
the
taste
is
good
enough
light
malts
some
green
bottle
funk
okay
overall
id
say
this
is
a
good
version
of
a
light
lager
not
a
bold
or
flashy
beer
but
does
the
job
of
a
light
thirst
quencher
rjt
poured
a
1
white
head
with
a
decent
lifespan
the
body
is
a
clear
straw
yellow
color
with
fairly
lively
effervescence
it
smells
faintly
of
grass
and
not
really
much
else
the
taste
is
extremely
light
a
touch
sweet
and
has
a
very
low
hoppy
finish
but
it
persists
this
is
on
par
with
bmc
beers
youre
just
paying
a
little
extra
for
the
import
from
spain
tastes
overly
sweet
and
adjunct
too
to
me
this
is
little
better
than
the
major
lagers
out
there
didnt
know
it
was
glutenfree
but
i
cant
get
past
the
generic
taste
no
thanks
surprise
to
me
im
enjoying
this
beer
by
far
the
best
euro
pale
lager
ive
had
poured
from
a
brown
11
2
oz
bottle
has
a
pale
yellow
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
heavy
with
grains
taste
is
a
bit
unusual
grains
wet
hay
some
bitterness
not
very
good
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
overall
i
did
not
care
much
for
this
beer
cons
simple
expensive
o
theres
nothing
overly
special
about
this
beer
but
its
pretty
good
considering
it
is
glutenfree
it
definitely
doesnt
taste
like
a
watereddown
adjunct
lager
macro
i
kinda
like
this
because
the
aroma
is
not
exactly
what
you
get
with
the
taste
quite
surprised
and
like
that
although
the
taste
was
to
light
for
my
palate
im
pretty
sure
that
this
beer
smells
like
a
skunks
ass
which
is
one
of
this
things
that
you
will
never
smell
in
your
life
god
i
hope
so
but
somehow
you
just
know
thats
exactly
what
it
would
be
like
the
flavor
however
is
quite
nice
especially
considering
that
this
is
a
glutenfree
beer
my
experience
with
these
types
of
beers
in
the
past
have
mostly
been
abysmal
but
this
is
a
good
drinker
the
girl
at
whole
foods
talked
this
one
up
pretty
high
and
i
have
to
say
that
she
was
absolutely
right
this
is
the
best
glutenfree
beer
i
have
had
to
date
still
a
cool
refreshment
on
a
really
hot
day
o
pretty
good
for
a
light
lager
pours
a
crystal
clear
golden
yellow
with
a
medium
lasting
white
head
with
some
light
lacing
visible
aroma
and
taste
is
fruity
grainsm
grassy
with
some
malted
barley
and
light
bitterness
palate
is
a
light
crisp
body
with
moderate
carbonation
finishes
with
some
fruity
grainy
and
light
grassy
notes
and
light
bitterness
did
not
know
this
was
gluten
free
until
after
i
had
it
but
overall
an
ok
slightly
crisp
lager
the
body
was
fairly
typical
for
the
style
lightmedium
clean
and
with
a
dry
finish
drinkability
was
very
good
you
could
easily
drink
these
all
day
or
all
night
overall
a
nice
little
beer
it
wont
get
a
permanent
spot
in
my
fridge
but
i
can
see
grabbing
a
bottle
sometimes
when
im
in
the
mood
for
a
crisp
light
brew
worth
trying
if
you
see
it
overall
very
drinkable
a
nice
beer
considering
it
is
gluten
free
and
actually
pretty
tasty
i
gotta
say
i
enjoyed
this
euro
pale
lager
because
the
hop
character
stood
out
more
than
other
brands
owhen
i
was
pouring
this
it
looked
really
thin
and
watery
and
while
it
was
thin
it
was
not
as
bad
as
i
thought
and
the
smell
was
a
lot
skunkier
than
the
taste
so
overall
not
bad
if
you
need
a
quick
thirst
quencher
this
is
not
something
id
grab
by
the
6er
but
for
what
it
is
its
not
too
shabby
best
gluten
free
beer
ill
take
their
word
for
it
as
others
ive
tried
were
no
ways
near
this
good
and
im
not
about
to
make
it
my
lifes
mission
to
find
a
better
one
good
grasscutting
beer
beer
for
the
hot
days
when
you
want
a
refreshing
light
beer
o
good
but
not
great
lager
would
be
a
nice
beer
while
doing
outdoor
chores
as
it
goes
down
nice
but
not
what
id
want
on
most
occasions
o
id
never
had
a
glutenfree
beer
so
i
gave
this
one
a
try
to
find
out
how
it
stacked
up
it
wasnt
outstanding
but
it
would
be
perfectly
acceptable
if
i
couldnt
consume
gluten
actually
it
was
reminiscent
of
a
slightlysweet
stella
artois
ill
certainly
recommend
it
to
celiacdisease
friends
who
like
beer
this
beer
pours
a
very
light
bodied
and
crystal
clear
bright
polished
gold
in
color
with
a
one
finger
quickly
dissipating
white
head
the
nose
consists
of
slightly
sweet
pale
malts
with
a
grainy
side
to
it
it
smells
like
a
dortmunder
really
the
flavors
are
light
with
a
slightly
sweet
pale
maltiness
and
a
cerealesque
clean
dry
finish
its
not
too
bad
its
like
a
lighter
easier
to
drink
pale
lager
its
really
light
and
refreshing
overall
this
beer
isnt
too
bad
and
at
8
99
a
four
pack
not
overpriced
compared
to
other
euro
lagers
received
a
4pk
as
a
gift
reviewing
while
drinking
the
4thnot
in
a
row
pours
a
strawyellow
with
a
12finger
head
significant
lacing
down
the
glass
has
that
beer
hall
smell
lots
of
graincereal
i
found
the
taste
almost
offputting
but
in
this
last
bottle
ill
say
its
not
terrible
good
carbonation
helps
kind
of
a
dry
finish
so
if
you
gotta
go
gluten
free
overall
among
the
glutenfree
beers
it
truly
shines
as
ive
never
enjoyed
the
use
of
repellent
sorghum
o
with
exception
of
the
mouthful
an
average
europale
when
compared
within
style
mediocre
drinkability
an
overall
average
experience
and
what
you
would
expect
pours
a
clear
golden
body
with
three
fingers
of
bright
white
foam
that
beautifully
laces
the
glass
aromas
typical
for
the
style
grains
and
honey
with
some
light
hay
or
straw
taste
is
consistent
with
the
nose
and
is
better
than
most
other
eurolagers
in
that
it
is
free
of
any
sort
of
artificialchemical
funkiness
easy
to
drink
nothing
super
ponderous
crystal
clear
and
light
yellow
in
color
with
a
half
inch
of
white
head
that
leaves
ample
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
subtle
but
offers
some
light
scents
of
malt
and
pilsner
very
light
in
body
smooth
feel
and
goes
down
easy
lacking
complexity
but
easy
to
throw
back
a
pint
or
two
just
a
slight
sweetness
with
a
touch
of
bitterness
in
the
finish
overall
a
good
choice
if
you
are
seeking
a

im
trying
one
of
my
wifes
beers
who
has
been
gluten
free
for
almost
six
months
and
this
is
easily
the
most
akin
to
a
regular
brew
clear
gold
with
a
thin
white
head
and
good
lacing
nice
crisp
pils
malt
zippy
carbonation
and
a
surprisingly
bold
saaz
finish
clean
and
satisfying
truthfully
i
dont
think
id
be
able
to
tell
the
difference
between
this
and
a
standard
continental
lager
tasting
blindly
very
similar
to
warsteiner
in
my
opinion
if
i
were
gluten
free
and
wishing
for
real
beer
flavor
this
is
hands
down
the
most
authentic
gluten
free
brew
i
can
find
for
my
wife
in
one
of
the
best
beer
towns
in
the
us
weve
tried
just
about
everything
available
since
she
removed
gluten
from
her
diet
and
this
is
the
best
by
far
in
terms
of
an
authentic
beer
taste
now
if
only
this
magical
gluten
removing
process
were
applied
to
an
ipa
lambic
or
another
of
her
favorite
styles
until
then
this
will
do
just
fine
330ml
single
from
lifesource
and
this
one
is
clearly
the
best
and
scores
extra
points
to
help
those
with
this
dilemma

the

talks
at

about

did

i
just
wish
that

had

color
me
mixed

good

larger
with

cheap

not

easy

a
pretty
low

beer
overall
standard
cheap
adjuncts
with
cereal
grains
and
not
really
much
else
here
drinkable
overall
it
may
not
be
a

but
it

for

cant

that
not

www

comwhasize
so
beeradvocate
hollindia
is
a
decent
cheap
beer
id
prefer
it
over
a
bud
miller
or
coors
the
price
is
right
too
at
food
4
less
you
can
get
a
4pk
of
16
9oz
cans
for
2
99
that
has
to
be
one
of
the
best
deals
you
can
get
for
a
beer
that
wont
make
you
gag
it
really
is
like
a
cheap
version
of
heineken
id
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
who
just
needed
a
couple
of
beers
for
the
night
and
was
on
a
budget
o
another
euro
lager
that
is
nonoffensive
it
is
more
of
a
barley
juice
with
low
drinkability
i
will
remember
not
to
drink
it
again
d
its
drinkable
for
sure
very
light
and
easy
going
low
alcohol
which
i
like
good
cheap
party

smelly
this
beer
tastes
a
lot
like
this
brewerys
bavaria
beer
but
transfers
nicely
into
a
hop
bitterness
that
dries
out
the
palate
this
brew
is
completely
average
id
call
it
a
better
version
of
heineken
hhawk06mar
27
but
it
has
a
fair
malt
and
hop
flavor
again
this
is
a
bit
ahead
of
the
middle
of
the
pack
bright
and
clean
with
a
moderate
head
no
lacing
to
speak
of
fairly
descent
carbonation
with
numerous
small
bubbles
aroma
is
slightly
skunked
and
this
gives
it
a
less
than
sterling
mouthfeel
good
to
try
slightly
sour
but
with
some
peppery
hop
sense
to
offset
the
absolutely
tasteless
sweet
mash
a
bit
of
a
weird
hot
cinnamon
in
the
aftertaste
doesnt
generate
enough
flavor
for
me
to
have
much
of
an
opinion
other
than
it
doesnt
have
the
dryness
of
a
decent
pilsner
nor
the
drinkability
of
a
mid
pack
lager
adrmar
04
however
heineken
may
have
done
it
right
the
bad
way
but
this
beer
steals
the
show
for
being
not
only
bland
but
with
the
imported
lager
taste
too
and
doing
it
all
the
wrong
way
either
way
they
are
the
same
only
this
one
is
cheaper
so
buy
this
one
over
heineken
this
beer
is
just
not
happening
at
all

rated
from
previous
tasting
notes
ive
only
tried
this
once
but
the
one
i
had
was
definitely
a
skunky
beer
since
i
had
it
from
the
bottle
had
to
guesstimate
at
the
look
ricola
i
am
neutral
on
this
beer
a
very
decent
session
lager
in
my
opinion
a
step
above
the
other
global
brands
for
me
anyway
not
the
best
but
not
anywhere
near
the
worst
i
really
do
enjoy
grolsch
never
out
of
a
can
always
always
out
of
a
bottle
only
thing
great
is
the
bottle
grolsch
is
a
very
good
beer
overall
well
balanced
beer
with
good
freshness
but
way
too
bland
in
flavors
its
a
lager
so
its
not
meant
to
be
strong
however
i
believe
they
put
more
on
the
bottle
than
they
do
in
their
ingredients
could
be
better
such
a
cool
bottle
deserves
a
better
beer
mild
maltyness
in
both
aroma
and
taste
crystal
clear
bright
yello
appearence
however
over
all
pretty
boring
average
lager
i
really
like
this
beer
especially
in
the
bottle
with
the
flip
top
cap
good
beer
but
nothing
special
almost
sweet
with
some
skunk
the
taste
was
little
too
bitter
for
my
liking
as
well
was
the
smell
the
best
beer
in
the
world
o
grolsch
premium
lager
is
a
great
pick
when
you
are
in
holland
it
is
very
reminiscent
of
german
beers
and
according
to
some
it
is
brewed
by
the
german
purity
law
i
have
reviewed
a
few
lagers
under
a
different
account
and
i
have
to
say
im
unimpressed
its
possible
the
ingredients
are
of
higher
quality
but
the
finished
product
has
a
mediocrity
that
matches
u
s
macro
lagers
a
bit
more
honey
than
vegetable
in
the
flavor
and
more
skunk
sulfur
on
the
nose
however
it
is
very
quaffable
and
refreshing
and
sets
its
own
standards
good
not
great
but
great
bonus
swing
top
for
homebrew
i
find
it
a
very
nice
lager
refreshing
and
a
cheaper
option
than
any
other
special
beer
11
eur
i
like
and
enjoyt
it
bottles
are
indeed
very
useful
o
while
not
great
grolsch
is
certainly
better
than
your
average
american
adjunct
lager
serve
ice
cold
and
drink
it
up
before
it
warms
overall
i
used
to
drink
this
before
there
were
microbrews
because
it
was
something
different
my
palate
has
really
changed
there
are
better
lagers
to
be
had
domestically
and
abroad
i
would
not
but
this
one
again
the
bottles
are
great
for
home
brewing
but
that
is
the
best
part
about
this
beer
ice
cold
this
s
is
taaaaaasteeeeeeree
yum
good
cold
beer
wife
wants
to
keep
every
bottle
for
some
reason
it
have
a
slight
taste
of
honey
as
the
temperature
increase
this
is
my
third
favorite
beer
but
it
is
hard
to
find
here
where
i
am
i
prefer
it
in
the
green
glass
cork
topped
bottle
the
flavours
are
stronger
in
the
mouth
than
on
the
nose
definite
grass
hops
with
bready
malts
hanging
about
overall
not
a
bad
lager
at
all
but
neither
is
it
anything
too
special
pretty
standard
macro
and
a
pretty
standard
macro
price
at
au45
a
case
still
decent
my
rating
is
skewed
by
nostalgia
but
it
is
definitely
a
good
dutch
lager
best
served
very
cold
chill
a
stein
its
a
crisp
beer
thats
way
better
when
its
cold
than
when
it
warms
up
i
think
the
cost
is
only
justified
if
youre
getting
the
bottles
because
you
dont
see
those
springtopfliptopspringtop
bottles
anymore
serving
type
bottle
when
i
was
first
getting
into
real
beer
i
liked
this
a
lot
maybe
its
the
bottle
but
it
always
seemed
just
a
little
nicer
than
what
was
in
my
parents
fridge
revisiting
it
this
weekend
was
uninspiring
its
heavier
in
malt
than
i
remember
seemingly
stale
and
under
carbonated
and
definitely
light
struck
in
its
once
distinguishing
green
glass
skunks
for
sure
this
may
be
a
little
older
than
optimal
but
its
heavy
as
these
lagers
go
more
sturdy
and
definitely
with
more
malt
flavor
i
bet
this
is
much
better
fresh
at
the
source
but
it
doesnt
travel
real
well
in
my
experience
more
filling
than
it
should
be
just
quite
unremarkable
compared
to
my
nostalgia
best
part
is
having
the
bottles
for
home
brewing
later
so
would
i
recommend
it
for
sure
this
is
much
better
than
a
heineken
even
if
the
taste
is
almost
similar
a
little
bit
expensive
here
in
canada
but
definitely
enjoyable

this

at

52drinkability
i
will
be
passing
on
this
in
the
future
for
the
style
grolsch
gets
a
low
drinkability
score
but
dont
expect
394
years
of
their
brewing
tradition
to
make
any
difference
separating
this
from
the
pack
but
still
not
bad
for
a
lager
the
taste
follows
with
a
bit
of
sweet
malt
up
front
and
of
course
the
esters
pilsner
malt
and
adjunct
flavor
that
goes
down
with
ease
and
finishes
clean
there
is
a
light
bitterness
this
is
a
decent
beer
there
is
enough
in
it
that
i
could
drink
it
in
a
pinch
but
not
enough
that
i
would
call
it
a
good
euro
lager
and
hints
of
bitterness
on
the
finish
this
reminds
me
of

nothing

still

goes

not

kick
this
is
a

beer
to
stick
with
for
an
evening
once
you
get
past
the
sweetness
d
i
really
like
the
kolsch
style
and
this
didnt
really
have
any
of
the
distict
qualities
of
this
style
there
wasnt
much
character
to
the
malt
and
the
slight
sulfury
sweetness
was
overpowered
by
hops
d
decent
ill
kick
back
a
few
before
moving
on
and
would
choose
it
over
most
other
water
lagers
i
wonder
if
sab
will
change
anything
now
that
theyve
bought
it
ill
try
one
again
in
6
months
and
see
if
it

you
really

review
translated
from
french
5252008
happy
to
have
the
bottles
for
my
homebrew
might
buy
a
case
sometime
comment
the
distinctive
packaging
makes
this
a
beer
that
calls
out
to
be
selected
from
the
commonness
that
surround
it
on
the
shelf
however
after
drinking
the
beer
you
come
to
find
it
is
a
fairly
common
lager
this
euro
lager
is
heavy
in
spite
of
itself
i
could
see
the
16oz
bottle
filling
me
up
for
sure
its
not
bad
for
the
first
beer
of
the
night
but
i
probably
wouldnt
have
even
tasted
it
if
it
was
my
second
i
probably
wont
buy
this
beer
again
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
if
it
was
offered
to
me
if
there
wasnt
a
better
alternative
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
however
i
dont
think
that
im
going
to
pour
another
when
i
have
other
good
beers
in
the
fridge
pours
a
pale
golden
yellow
with
a
white
head
aromas
of
a
european
sweet
malt
in
the
taste
malty
sweet
and
a
dry
end
a
very
smooth
mouthfeel
and
a
dry
malty
aftertaste
a
decent
lager
kind
of
standard
european
lager
but
better
than
i
thought
andor
remember
too
bad
they
arent
brown
not
a
bad
beer
better
than
expected
mouthfeel
was
watery
but
with
the
lower
alcohal
content
this
is
one
i
could
drink
all
night
drinkability
is
good
this
is
a
light
lager
with
a
macro
type
taste
nothing
much
to
praise
from
this
bottle
poured
from
16
oz
fliptop
bottle
very
nice
heavy
duty
green
glass
pours
a
starwlike
yellow
and
leaves
thick
2
finger
head
that
quickly
decipates
leaves
slight
traces
of
lace
behind
smell
is
strawlike
as
well
with
some
citrus
hints
earthy
smell
taste
is
somewhat
bland
not
really
hoppy
not
really
malty
a
very
present
grain
taste
with
some
slight
sweetness
moderate
carbonation
and
light
mouthfeel
makes
this
an
easy
drinker
despite
that
bland
factor
in
taste
not
a
terrible
beer
but
not
a
standout
either
not
the
best
beer
in
my
opinion
drinkability
not
bad
on
a
hot
day
like
today
nice
to
bbq
w
but
not
sure
if
id
drink
on
a
cold
night
coming
from
someone
who
used
to
regard
the
green
frost
beading
porcelaincapped
bottles
as
some
kind
of
treasure
20
years
ago
a
recent
tasting
of
grolsch
in
12
oz
bottles
disappointed
to
the
degree
of
returning
the
bottles
to
the
store
as
skunked
could
it
be
lightheat
a
recipe
change
i
may
never
know
groslch
of
old
used
to
be
malty
fresh
clean
hopped
a
very
refreshing
delightful
drink
pours
a
light
yellow
color
with
ample
carbonation
and
a
decent
head
aroma
is
one
of
grain
and
just
a
tiny
bit
of
skunk
even
smells
a
bit
hoppy
taste
very
smooth
and
the
malt
really
shines
through
a
bit
sour
of
a
finish
but
overall
quite
a
drinkable
lager
i
could
see
myself
buying
something
like
this
if
i
wanted
something
cheap
and
still
a
step
above
most
macro
lagers
will
try
again
for
sure
not
bad
at
all
pours
a
clear
light
golden
colour
white
head
settled
quickly
with
a
wispy
centre
lightly
carbonated
with
a
ring
around
the
glass
i
detected
a
wet
grassy
odour
that
was
a
bit
skunky
this
lager
is
dry
a
bit
hoppy
and
with
a
sharp
finish
refreshing
bitterness
but
a
little
sour
on
the
finish
not
overly
complex
but
satisfying
and
pretty
typical
of
the
style
compares
favourably
to
a
heineken
for
example
drinkability
a
refreshing
beer
that
is
pretty
good
for
a
warm
day
pours
a
golden
straw
color
with
a
decent
white
head
that
left
some
spotty
lacing
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
faint
grainy
some
grassy
hops
slight
cooked
veggie
smell
a
cracker
like
malt
base
with
some
grassy
hops
a
bit
of
that
euro
lager
green
bottle
skunk
taste
i
give
it
a
3
5
because
it
does
resemble
a
pilsner
to
a
certain
extent
th
feel
is
light
almost
watery
well
carbonated
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
better
than
the
other
dutch
green
bottle
euro
lager
as
it
is
not
as
skunky
though
it
is
green
i
dig
the
bottle
i
have
found
grolsch
to
vary
in
quality
more
than
most
beers
this
example
was
not
skunked
and
did
not
impress
me
but
i
have
enjoyed
drinking
grolsch
in
the
past
a
slightly
better
than
average
euro
lager
with
a
reasonably
high
price
a
better
bet
than
heineken
but
nothing
remarkable
i
tried
this
beer
on
august
12
2007
at
purchasing
it
at
an
lcbo
store
it
poured
a
translucent
pale
gold
colour
into
the
glass
with
a
generous
white
head
that
quickly
disappeared
leaving
some
rocky
lacing
on
top
the
aroma
was
slightly
malty
the
mouthfeel
was
thinbodied
crisp
with
mild
carbonation
definitely
not
a
watery
feel
the
taste
was
that
of
malt
hops
and
a
little
spiciness
i
cant
place
overall
a
decent
beer
pours
a
light
gold
not
giving
off
much
aroma
little
head
and
mild
tracing
from
what
i
could
whiff
it
had
a
weak
malty
smell
it
tastes
alright
but
a
bit
grainy
it
does
go
down
pretty
smooth
its
fairly
drinkable
enough
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
it
carbonation
is
pretty
brisk
but
not
unpleasant
pretty
light
and
i
suppose
reasonably
refreshing
ill
pass
on
another
but
if
drank
quickly
enough
to
keep
somewhat
cold
i
wont
have
much
trouble
finishing
one
poured
into
glass
from
resealable
green
bottle
a
good
head
that
laces
out
nicely
the
smell
is
a
little
like
granny
smith
apples
and
alcohol
the
taste
bitter
green
apples
hops
and
sour
grains
it
finishes
with
a
mellow
skunk
weed
flavor
this
is
my
girlfriends
favorite
beer
and
im
always
robbing
them
out
of
the
fridge
from
her
a
decent
beer
pale
gold
in
color
with
about
2
fingers
of
bone
white
head
that
dissipates
rather
quickly
but
leaves
some
lacing
smells
a
bit
hoppy
at
first
followed
by
some
malty
sweetness
with
hints
of
grass
overall
fairly
pleasant
but
nothing
special
tastes
first
of
a
nice
spicy
hoppyness
followed
by
some
earthiness
which
seems
overdone
to
me
all
of
this
is
supported
by
a
nice
malt
backbone
mouthfeel
is
ok
body
is
light
bordering
on
watery
carbonation
is
just
shy
of
moderate
overall
this
beer
failed
to
impress
me
something
about
the
earthiness
in
the
taste
just
didnt
seem
to
work
with
the
rest
of
the
flavors
i
dont
think
ill
be
buying
this
anytime
soon
as
there
are
so
many
other
and
potentially
more
enjoyable
beers
out
there
for
me
to
try
this
is
another
one
that
i
like
a
lot
better
straight
from
the
bottle
very
good
epl
from
the
bottle
smooth
yet
skunky
like
st
pauli
and
the
like
common
drinkable
though
really
going
to
be
hard
to
get
the
character
quota
on
this
one
there
are
so
many
beers
like
this
you
can
just
compare
it
to
another
and
be
done
heineken
and
all
those
this
one
not
as
skunky
and
a
little
better
on
drinkablity
a
very
drinkable
lager
and
not
skunky
like
so
many
green
bottled
eurolagers
can
be
not
bad
but
probably
too
expensive
to
become
a
staple
at
my
house
thin
yellow
color
that
poured
very
fizzy
for
a
medium
head
that
died
quickly
aroma
is
thick
and
bready
with
what
i
like
to
call
that
cardboard
quality
flavor
is
yeasty
and
a
bit
dry
but
again
is
pretty
heavy
in
that
bread
category
with
a
tangy
touch
to
the
tongue
a
good
lager
with
some
character
but
not
the
kind
of
quenching
brew
i
like
from
a
lager
a
good
change
of
pace
lager
and
an
old
standby
if
and
i
say
if
the
fairly
gross
pale
euro
lager
is
your
thing
then
i
would
consider
this
significantly
better
than
its
peers
in
fact
its
one
of
the
better
representations
of
the
style
still
arent

typical
europale
skunk
taste
is
suprisingly
better
than
its
other
mass
produced
counterparts
nice
hoppiness
grassy
bite
is
pleasant
and
definately
unexpected
finish
is
a
little
underwhelmingtastewise
and
then
it
gets
a
little
bitter
afterward
i
must
say
im
pleasantly
suprised
it
had
been
sometime
since
id
had
one
of
these
im
glad
i
revisted
this
brew
a
good
quencher
for
the
summertime
found
12pk

harry
quick
stop
in
cleveland
tn
not
bad
at
all
typical
pale
lager
but
with
less
negative
qualities
than
most
the
hops
put
it
a
nudge
above
the
rest
feels
good
in
th
mouth
very
easy
to
drink
final
statement
i
dont
think
anyone
with
some
knowledge
of
beer
will
claim
this
to
be
world
class
with
that
being
said
i
really
enjoy
this
one
its
at
least
a
dozen
steps
ahead
of
heineken
stella
becks
as
far
as
mainstream
euro
lagers
go
and
pretty
damn
cheap
its
a
good
beer
to
take
fishing
and
its
nothing
to
turn
down
if
i
finish
this
bottle
ill
be
surprised
crystal
clear
nice
white
head
the
aroma
is
somewhat
fruity
a
little
malty
and
a
little
creamed
corn
dms
the
flavor
is
not
bad
cleaner
than
the
aroma
suggests
with
a
crisp
character
some
residual
sweet
maltiness
and
a
nice
touch
of
bitterness
overall
this
is
a
nice
light
beer
not
anything
to
write
home
about
but
it
suits
its
purposes
and
has
its
place
time
poured
into
a
pint
glass
this
lager
has
a
nice
clean
golden
color
it
has
a
slight
smell
of
malts
but
it
is
minimal
this
beer
had
a
quarter
inch
head
tthat
lasted
a
while
nothing
to
distinctive
about
this
beer
it
has
a
clean
taste
with
a
finish
of
hops
no
skunkiness
like
you
find
in
some
imports
the
one
noticable
thing
about
this
lager
was
the
carbonation
i
had
a
chance
to
visit
europe
and
this
was
a
good
beer
there
and
is
just
as
good
back
in
the
states
just
nothing
to
brag
about
worth
a
try
this
beer
is
like
heineken
but
without
that
strange
chemical
after
taste
if
youre
into
this
type
of
beer
this
stuff
is
decent
after
all
they
have
like
over
200
years
of
brewing
experience
on
heiny
heiny
is
1873
grolsch
is
1615
so
that
should
tell
you
something
not
the
best
beer
but
cerainly
not
a
heineken
and
definately
not
a
crudweiser
this
was
the
first
beer
that
i
ever
really
tried
granted
it
tastes
much
better
now
than
it
did
then
but
its
still
rather
unimpressive
but
the
bottle
is
still
cool
ok
i
started
buying
this
beer
for
the
bottles
i
needed
them
for
my
homebrewing
endeavors
i
kinda
got
hooked
for
a
little
while
i
got
acclimated
to
the
skunky
smell
and
bitter
aftertaste
it
has
a
nice
zing
that
rolls
over
the
tongue
if
i
need
any
more
nice
bottles
i
will
start
swilling
this
again
otherwise
i
am
staying
away
from
anything
in
a
green
bottle
recommended
appearance
gets
points
more
for
the
swing
top
ceramic
cap
bottle
than
the
beer
itself
typical
macrolager
in
appearance
kinda
like
a
bigger
skunkier
heineken
funny
that
people
think
the
hops
turning
from
the
light
to
those
offskunky
aromas
is
what
was
intended
can
actually
detect
some
malt
in
those
nose
and
in
the
taste
but
not
a
whole
lot
light
and
spritzy
short
finish
is
crisp
and
clean
drinkability
decent
due
to
the
abv
the
flavor
is
certainly
a
bit
different
than
usual
euro
pales
theres
a
good
amount
of
maltiness
but
its
offset
by
a
spicy
herbal
note
that
i
found
to
be
fairly
enjoyable
theres
an
earthiness
to
the
hops
and
a
slightly
dry
finish
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
but
this
is
still
quite
a
solid
pale
lager
id
take
it
over
most
of
the
other
euro
pales
ive
had
drinkability
not
that
exceptional
will
pass
it
up
the
next
time
i
see
it
on
the
shelves
for
something
new
overall
i
find
this
one
not
very
pleasant
it
is
too
unbalanced
towards
the
bitterness
it
simply
does
not
go
down
nicely
a
medium
golden
color
with
carbonation
very
visibile
in
the
glass
a
small
white
head
forms
and
has
fairly
good
retention
a
bread
and
biscuit
fragrances
is
there
at
first
sniff
then
a
fruity
scents
come
out
mostly
of
citrus
the
taste
starts
with
a
mild
malt
flavor
folowed
by
a
roasted
barley
flavor
it
ends
with
a
slight
smack
of
bitterness
that
lingers
on
the
palate
for
sometime
a
light
and
watery
feel
though
it
does
have
a
dry
clean
finish
a
typical
euro
style
lager
but
this
does
have
a
unique
flavor
and
a
clean
finish
those
qualities
make
it
very
drinkable
final
grade
3
25
a
very
high
c
i
get
the
feeling
looking
my
scores
that
taste
keeps
this
beer
from
being
really
good
for
me
i
wont
be
drinking
this
again
all
in
all
its
an
alright
lager
if
i
were
low
on
dough
i
wouldnt
mind
drinking
these
if
i
were
looking
to
get
drunk
but
im
not
going
to
really
go
to
the
store
looking
for
this
footnote
had
this
w
some
tandoori
fish
and
it
was
a
excellent
pairing
ok
euro
lager
not
sure
i
could
drink
more
than
2
in
1
sitting
though
the
beer
itself
poured
a
bubbly
yellow
and
had
a
nice
13inch
head
smell
of
mellow
malts
and
that
distinct
and
in
this
beer
not
quite
as
offensive
as
most
skunky
musky
hops
taste
is
a
clean
slightly
bitter
body
with
a
malty
sweetness
that
comes
in
as
you
finish
your
sip
there
does
seem
to
be
some
cereal
grain
in
the
flavor
as
well
mild
on
the
pallet
carbonation
a
little
high
but
overall
easy
to
drink
and
my
new
york
cheddar
kettle
chips
made
this
not
very
classy
beer
even
better
overall
not
too
bad
i
would
definitely
take
this
over
heineken
any
day
drinks
fairly
easy
a
pretty
good
example
of
the
style
worth
a
shot
for
some
real
basic
beach
or
bbq
beer
i
paid
8
49
for
a
four
pack
of
this
at
my
local
safeway
here
in
eureka
ca
except
for
the
cool
bottle
that
is
a
lot
of
money
for
poor
beer
after
moving
aside
the
swingtop
lid
i
poured
a
very
light
amber
brew
with
a
small
white
head
and
almost
no
lacing
into
my
glass
the
nose
was
somewhat
stale
and
nasty
with
a
general
odor
of
fermenting
hay
and
sour
hops
mouthfeel
was
nondescript
and
flavor
is
basically
sweet
corn
not
a
whole
lot
better
than
corona
this
popularity
of
this
has
simply
got
to
be
a
case
of
marketing
basically
this
is
nearly
a
drain
pour
nasty
stuff
in
a
nice
bottle
no
place
to
rate
the
bottle
or
this
might
have
gotten
a
little
higher
score
this
has
been
a
bad
patch
for
tasting
as
this
is
the
fourth
bad
review
in
a
row
ide
buy
this
again
i
got
this
bottle
for
2
75
which
i
thought
wasnt
bad
not
a
bad
lager
at
all
grolsch
premium
lager
has
a
very
clear
yellowish
body
that
has
little
carbonation
and
a
thin
head
with
some
mild
lacing
it
has
a
mild
sweet
flavor
that
just
covers
your
mouth
its
crisp
but
it
isnt
dull
either
it
has
a
strong
aftertaste
that
has
a
hint
of
alcohol
in
it
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
over
all
and
i
would
mind
going
back
to
the
store
for
a
few
more
every
now
and
then
here
is
a
beer
meant
to
be
refreshing
and
not
challenging
i
think
it
succeeds
euro
macro
ho
hum
better
on
average
than
american
macro
but
still
boring
drinkability
its
okay
nothing
great
nothing
bad
during
a
longer
stopover
at
the
amsterdam
airport
i
had
the
chance
to
sample
various
dutch
beers
on
draught
grolsch
was
the
best
in
my
opinion
clean
taste
clean
aroma
and
a
nice
bitterness
that
other
dutch
massbeers
seem
to
lack
yuo
can
surely
drink
more
than
a
glass
without
endangering
your
health
d
fairly
drinkable
its
basically
just
a
solid
lager
thats
better
than
some
but
nothing
particularly
great
its
a
little
disappointing
really
given
how
sweet
the
bottle
is
an
aboveaverage
beer
that
even
a
serious
beer
connoisseur
can
enjoy
the
color
is
rich
and
inviting
and
the
smell
is
nice
and
beery
the
taste
though
not
complex
is
impressive
in
the
mouth
it
has
a
jazzy
sassy
feel
with
a
little
bit
of
a
kick
a
truly
delicious
lager
average
lager
better
than
some
can
drink
it
if
had
to
i
prefer
it
over
heineken
definatly
a
good
beer
if
im
going
out
for
a
night
of
drinking
it
pours
a
rich
dense
head
with
some
definition
inside
the
body
a
whiff
of
euroskunk
tm
and
spicy
herbs
is
followed
by
a
taste
of
herbs
hop
bitterness
with
some
malts
ending
the
sip
its
more
difficult
to
drink
than
a
typical
pale
lager
because
of
the
overwhelming
flavor
that
gets
in
the
way
poured
from
a
green
flip
top
16oz
bottle
darker
golden
yellow
color
well
carbonated
with
a
fluffy
white
head
decent
head
retention
that
left
a
slight
lace
smells
of
pale
malts
with
a
sweetness
of
fruit
and
a
slight
caramel
tone
some
hints
of
sourness
rather
smooth
taste
pale
malt
flavors
followed
by
a
dry
slight
bittering
hop
finish
decent
drinkability
has
the
distinct
euro
lager
funk
that
i
have
found
characteristic
to
the
style
not
my
favorite
euro
lager
but
also
not
the
worst
dnot
bad
i
honestly
bought
it
for
the
swing
top
bottle
since
i
just
started
home
brewing
i
bought
another
one
and
will
enjoy
it
as
well
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
beer
has
a
nice
threefinger
head
and
is
a
clear
golden
color
smell
is
like
most
commercial
lagers
heavy
on
the
corn
smell
with
a
slight
metallic
tinge
taste
is
initially
bitter
with
a
honey
sweet
flavor
to
follow
with
hints
of
fruit
and
a
crisp
bitter
finish
mouthfeel
is
light
and
velvety
with
a
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
better
than
most
macro
commercial
beers
but
nothing
too
special
either
this
lager
pours
a
golden
amber
with
a
white
head
and
little
head
retention
the
smell
was
rather
sweet
with
a
bit
of
herb
the
taste
is
a
good
solid
bitter
with
a
sweet
finish
it
has
decent
carbonation
and
is
somewhat
balanced
in
regard
to
mouthfeel
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
d
imo
this
is
a
mediocre
version
of
the
style
its
certainly
drinkable
but
its
not
a
beer
id
really
ever
buy
again
d
goes
down
like
water
not
unpleasant
easy
to
drink
but
nothing
special
to
make
it
an
experience
to
remember
light
golden
appearance
with
thin
white
head
aroma
not
that
great
smells
like
many
other
pale
lagers
the
taste
however
distinguishes
it
from
the
rest
has
a
bit
of
a
nutty
taste
to
it
and
is
easier
to
drink
definitely
something
id
stock
the
fridge
with
for
parties
or
just
for
relaxing
when
i
dont
have
much
cash
available
for
the
better
stuff
d
im
not
a
huge
fan
it
doesnt
go
down
as
smooth
and
i
would
have
liked
and
its
too
bitter
for
me
to
drink
on
a
regular
basis
first
impression
was
like
a
strong
tea
very
herbal
strong
taste
had
it
while
the
eurocup
2004
was
taking
place
we
did
a
eurobeer
contest
that
day
very
hopy
maybe
the
herbal
nastyness
was
due
to
the
expiry
date
the
second
time
i
had
it
was
on
can
very
drinkable
reminds
me
stella
very
golden
and
foamy
but
nothing
special
mouthfeel
drinkability
not
watery
but
light
good
carbonation
as
for
drinkability
better
than
bmc
and
better
than
heineken
but
not
great
probably
a
good
drop
with
a
light
meal
or
with
a
few
mates
in
the
sunshine
nothing
particularly
appealing
about
it
however
grolsch
premium
lager
was
a
clear
golden
color
the
head
was
white
and
had
pretty
good
retention
leaving
some
lace
behind
the
aroma
was
hops
with
a
little
malt
the
taste
was
crisp
and
clean
with
a
dry
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
light
with
plenty
of
carbontion
this
was
a
refreshing
thirst
quenching
beer
drinkability
one
of
the
best
epls
you
can
get
thats
readily
available
in
my
opinion
this
isnt
a
style
of
daredevil
beauty
but
i
think
this
brew
serves
the
style
well
in
coming
through
with
what
its
supposed
to
do
its
also
a
brew
that
goes
well
with
washing
some
grilled
food
down
too
pours
light
golden
with
pristine
clarity
two
finger
frothy
head
shows
good
retention
and
a
few
sticky
patches
of
lacing
mild
lightstruck
aroma
with
some
benign
noble
hops
and
pale
malt
in
the
background
pleasent
light
munich
and
pale
malt
sweetness
at
first
sip
followed
by
balancing
hallertau
and
slight
tettnanger
flavor
semidry
aftertaste
spicy
and
floral
hop
character
with
an
appropriate
bitterness
medium
in
body
and
carbonation
a
very
smooth
and
inviting
mouthfeel
highly
drinkable
finishes
soft
with
a
hint
of
pale
malt
sweetness
and
german
hop
bite
i
would
refer
this
to
people
looking
for
a
euro
pale
lager
that
doesnt
suck
this
one
is
not
bad
its
a
lot
like
a
funky
spicy
and
peppery
czech
pils
i
thought
that
this
was
skunked
initially
but
then
i
began
to
really
like
that
funky
flavor
i
could
seriously
session
this
brew
i
will
still
drink
it
once
in
a
while
however
because
i
like
the
bottles
for
homebrewing
oh
well
its
a
cool
bottle
pours
a
straw
colored
pale
yellow
color
with
a
fluffy
white
head
that
quickly
diminishes
into
a
thin
layer
of
lacing
typical
grainy
euro
lager
aroma
taste
is
grassy
and
grainey
that
finishes
with
a
slightly
herbal
hop
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
delightfully
smooth
overall
this
is
another
run
of
the
mill
euro
lager
that
does
not
do
enough
for
me
to
purchase
again
this
beer
poured
a
very
clear
golden
color
the
head
was
thick
and
persistent
the
smell
is
very
hoppy
the
taste
is
definitely
hopheavy
it
has
a
light
body
with
a
thin
feel
and
a
bitter
aftertaste
this
beer
is
possibly
drinkable
if
served
very
cold
maybe
the
real
stuff
brewed
in
holland
is
better
and
tastes
like
i
think
i
remember
i
hope
so
grolsch
to
me
is
like
a
premium
version
of
heineken
its
super
refined
compared
to
its
dutch
partner
you
cant
go
wrong
with
the
flip
top
its
classic
pale
euro
lager
in
appearance
and
pretty
much
no
head
for
the
most
part
the
smell
is
kinda
skunky
because
its
been
sitting
under
supermarket
lights
in
its
single
form
so
i
wont
hold
it
against
the
beer
the
taste
is
for
the
most
part
average
like
a
maltier
tastier
version
of
its
mass
produced
cousin
the
mouthfeel
is
also
fairly
heavy
for
lager
and
i
commend
them
for
achieving
that
with
how
pale
the
beer
is
the
drinkability
is
the
high
part
of
this
beer
very
sessionable
and
out
of
the
ordinary
it
will
definitely
get
people
talking
if
you
drink
it
right
out
of
the
flip
top
definatly
recommend
if
youre
looking
for
something
different
but
drinkable
smells
lagerish
fruity
with
a
bit
of
a
metallic
nose
taste
is
nice
and
light
a
bit
grainy
mouthfeel
is
good
nice
bubble
drinkability
is
also
good
as
this
is
one
of
those
you
could
drink
forever
although
you
might
regret
it
in
the
morning
not
bad
for
a
big
name
wiidely
distributed
beer
not
a
lot
of
aroma
and
the
appearance
is
weak
with
a
thin
head
and
little
lacing
but
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
especially
as
it
warms
around
midglass
and
it
has
a
smooth
finish
the
fliptop
stopper
on
the
bottle
adds
a
nice
touch
light
and
crisp
on
the
palate
very
refreshing
and
much
better
than
your
average
greenbottled
euro
skunklager
but
thats
not
saying
a
lot
its
worth
a
try
overall
okay
i
prefer
their
ale
more
unfortunately
i
cant
say
much
for
this
beer
positive
for
this
beer
very
little
character
very
little
body
and
the
bad
astringent
taste
of
a
macro
drinkability
well
at
last
count
i
had
light
looking
in
the
glass
without
much
of
a
head
not
a
strong
definable
scent
at
least
none
that
i
noticed
but
then
again
i
didnt
feel
like
keeping
my
nose
in
this
one
for
too
long
it
was
just
overall
unpleasant
there
was
a
murky
kind
of
swampy
taste
to
it
and
the
aftertaste
lingered
for
way
too
long
which
is
not
a
good
thing
in
this
case
but
hey
at
least
there
was
a
lot
of
carbonation
that
kept
me
belching
for
a
good
long
time
im
laying
on
the
sarcasm
pretty
heavy
in
case
you
werent
sure
this
beer
is
not
worthy
of
the
awesome
bottle
they
put
it
in
better
than
expected
but
i
wasnt
expecting
much
overall
not
a
favorite
but
im
in
for
a
case
thank
you
pa
liquor
laws
so
perhaps
it
will
grow
on
me
by
the
end
of
it
all
or
end
up
in
friends
fridges
exceptional
to
drink
while
in
a
cold
place
pours
a
nice
golden
color
with
pretty
good
white
head
and
good
but
not
overwhelming
carbonation
aroma
is
a
little
malty
a
little
hop
spicy
and
somewhat
funky
like
lightstruck
i
think
taste
is
better
malty
sweet
with
some
hops
bitterness
and
less
of
the
funk
mouthfeel
is
nice
light
smooth
and
pleasing
carbonation
drinkability
is
lessened
by
the
unpleasant
aroma
and
marginal
taste
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
stein
its
a
pretty
average
looking
pale
lager
but
the
head
is
nice
it
continues
to
swell
for
a
minute
or
two
until
theres
about
34
of
head
then
slowly
dies
down
and
leaves
a
nice
thin
lacing
the
nose
is
nice
somewhat
grassy
could
be
described
as
floral
the
flavor
is
well
balanced
its
got
a
bit
of
an
edge
to
it
between
a
slight
bitterness
and
a
touch
of
alcohol
flavor
mouthfeel
is
pretty
average
though
nothing
amazing
all
in
all
its
a
very
drinkable
beer
its
well
balanced
and
it
could
easily
make
be
a
session
beer
there
isnt
anything
wrong
with
this
but
its
really
nothing
special
if
you
hold
your
breath
before
you
sip
you
hardly
get
anything
for
flavour
but
if
you
inhale
right
before
drinking
it
mimics
the
aroma
in
the
taste
a
decent
euro
lager
that
would
be
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
pours
a
golden
straw
color
with
very
little
head
that
fades
into
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
and
laces
the
glass
smells
a
little
yeasty
and
a
little
hoppy
a
tiny
bit
citrusy
not
unpleasant
taste
isnt
very
malty
slightly
hoppy
at
first
and
then
some
chemical
bitterness
at
the
finish
leaving
a
chemical
aftertaste
i
guess
the
fact
that
there
isnt
much
flavor
is
a
blessing
mouthfeel
is
fairly
creamy
with
a
little
bit
of
carbonation
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
all
in
all
its
not
what
id
call
a
good
beer
but
its
not
what
id
call
a
bad
one
either
better
than
most
macros
and
a
lot
easier
to
drink
easier
to
drink
that
heineken
which
is
what
this
beer
is
very
and
obviously
similar
to
eh
save
your
money
unless
you
really
want
one
of
the
bottles
the
taste
isnt
bad
its
not
good
but
the
fact
that
it
isnt
bad
puts
it
ahead
of
most
macros
i
bought
a
case
of
flip
tops
and
it
was
delicious
i
updated
my
score
overall
overall
ok
not
unpleasant
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
no
skunk
smell
a
major
plus
the
taste
is
lightly
hopped
and
slightly
bitter
it
improves
as
you
drink
it
it
has
a
crisp
sharp
mouthfeel
it
is
also
very
drinkable
it
goes
well
with
food
or
by
itself
taste
is
crisp
grassy
malt
light
bitterness
in
the
finish
persistent
noble
hops
that
build
nicely
hallertau
or
saaz
dont
know
but
its
a
nice
finish
crisp
and
very
clean
mouth
a
lightly
sour
finish
lingering
hops
and
fizzy
mouth
this
is
shockingly
tasty
good
stuff
of
the
eurolagers
this
should
be
your
choice
overall
this
one
isnt
one
for
me
but
i
dont
hate
it
id
pick
this
over
heineken
but
thats
about
it
pretty
decent
beer
not
a
worldbeater
but
nothing
wrong
with
it
still
keep
the
bottle
for
something
carbonation
is
just
right
and
this
one
laces
the
whole
way
tastes
clean
with
feathery
light
barley
balanced
with
a
nice
bitter
hop
to
dry
the
finish
a
fuller
stronger
tasting
lager
than
others
of
this
style
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
fizzy
then
turns
dry
much
like
champagne
with
very
little
sweetness
easy
drinking
mediumlight
body
with
enough
flavor
to
satisfy
not
bad
almost
honey
like
sweetness
is
followed
by
stale
malty
flavour
which
sticks
around
too
long
for
the
hops
to
give
this
enough
edge
quite
like
the
carbonation
here
but
thats
about
it
would
be
easy
to
drain
a
lot
of
but
this
is
no
better
than
pbr
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
d
easy
to
drink
goes
well
with
food
let
me
put
it
this
way
if
you
have
the
choice
between
this
and
heineken
pick
this
every
day
of
the
week
decent
pleasing
but
nothing
exceptional
here
gold
colour
with
a
snowy
dense
head
that
disappates
fairly
quickly
hoppy
smell
with
hints
of
grass
and
a
bit
of
a
corn
mash
smell
taste
is
bland
malts
and
tame
hops
with
some
grassy
overtones
reminiscent
of
tusker
or
an
indian
lager
not
bad
but
nothing
great
easy
to
drink
great
for
the
summer
with
some
spicy
foods
very
light
golden
brew
in
a
green
bottle
white
head
full
of
large
bubbles
subsided
to
a
thin
cover
not
the
best
looking
beer
aroma
reminds
me
of
only
one
word
macro
as
in
that
typical
uninviting
aroma
of
a
macro
brew
taste
is
actually
not
bad
plain
yes
light
body
yes
weak
yes
but
not
bad
to
drink
given
the
opportunity
i
would
not
mind
trying
this
beer
on
tap
and
in
a
bar
full
of
macro
beers
i
would
pick
it
as
my
session
beer
in
a
second
not
enough
flavor
but
still
drinkable
pours
yellow
with
fluffy
white
head
tastes
and
smells
like
typical
euro
lager
i
like
to
have
one
or
two
good
beers
and
then
switch
over
to
whatever
american
macro
or
euro
lager
i
find
on
sale
for
a
session
beer
grolsch
is
perfectly
acceptable
for
session
beer
but
its
nothing
to
get
excited
about
either
i
do
like
the
swingtop
bottles
but
the
green
glass
really
is
a
bad
idea
an
enjoyable
brew
for
a
mass
eurolager
so
maybe
drinkable
but
not
for
more
than
the
500ml
minibomber
hey
the
swing
top
was
nice
i
have
a
long
history
with
this
beer
back
to
when
i
first
saw
the
swingtop
bottle
and
thought
that
looks
cool
and
tried
it
it
is
everything
a
generic
western
european
lager
should
be
poured
into
a
pilsner
glass
pretty
carbonation
good
head
retention
and
the
colour
of
pale
straw
everything
i
look
for
in
a
lager
the
smell
is
where
it
gets
tricky
ive
always
known
this
to
be
a
skunky
beer
but
its
one
of
the
top
most
skunky
beers
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
smelling
other
than
that
corn
adjuncts
malty
sweet
and
a
slight
soapiness
that
all
compliment
the
skunkiness
taste
isnt
awful
decent
hop
bitterness
to
offset
the
malts
dry
mouthfeel
sticks
to
the
throat
a
bit
zingy
on
the
tongue
more
drinkable
on
tap
i
think
but
whatever
this
is
a
very
average
euro
lager
not
super
offensive
but
certainly
not
the
peak
of
the
brewers
art
moderate
carbonation
and
goes
down
smooth
easy
to
drink
overall
a
typical
eurolager
one
of
my
all
time
favourties
the
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
is
better
than
everything
else
so
far
the
higer
carbonation
makes
it
feel
interesting
on
the
palate
i
also
like
the
dry
feelingfinish
it
has
on
the
palate
the
beer
goes
down
very
easy
and
is
light
bodied
this
beer
is
extremely
easy
to
drink
it
goes
down
smooth
and
in
my
opinion
might
go
pretty
well
with
a
pizza
this
isnt
something
that
i
wouldnt
buy
again
however
its
near
the
top
on
my
list
of
beers
to
buy
again
interesting
reading
the
back
label
that
one
bottle
is
approx
1
3
standard
drinks
but
hey
the
metal
spring
loaded
bottle
cap
is
a
nice
touch
like
the
dry
malt
but
wetter
finish
reminds
of
macros
every
aspect
has
something
off
the
mark
that
keeps
me
from
wanting
another
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
just
nothing
to
get
too
excited
about
if
not
in
a
coffeeshop
i
like
the
blue
velvet
dont
go
out
of
your
way
for
this
one
drinkable
for
a
euro
macro
larger
but
not
something
i
will
chase
presentation
packaged
in
a
custom
twelve
ounce
green
glass
bottle
with
a
popoff
crown
served
in
a
standard
tap
glass
whenever
i
go
and
buy
a
sixpack
it
has
to
pass
the
grolsch
test
would
i
enjoy
these
beers
at
the
end
of
the
day
more
than
grolsch
often
the
answer
is
yes
but
the
test
remains
a
good
barometer
for
quality
beer
poured
from
the
classic
swing
top
bottle
always
a
plus
this
lager
poured
a
golden
wheat
color
with
about
a
14
inch
head
that
i
was
not
impressed
with
although
it
did
leave
a
nice
lace
the
first
thing
youll
notice
is
the
skunky
smell
its
not
overwhelming
and
it
doesnt
particulary
bother
me
i
thought
it
was
actually
pretty
smooth
at
first
for
a
dutch
lager
it
leaves
an
aftertaste
that
is
somewhere
between
hops
and
a
light
citrus
no
film
or
sticky
residue
to
note
could
use
a
little
more
kick
if
thats
what
your
into
i
would
recommend
as
a
night
out
with
friends
lager
nothing
to
sit
down
and
ponder
like
i
just
did
d
average
i
bought
this
as
part
of
a
sampler
and
im
glad
i
did
only
one
drink
it
dont
pay
much
of
a
price
review
and
dont
invite
it
back
it
wasnt
so
bad
it
smelled
like
ballantine
skunky
ale
and
in
the
glass
just
like
ballantine
it
looked
yellow
just
like
any
beer
with
a
sticky
head
that
almost
looked
like
it
contained
fibers
really
odd
mouth
was
a
little
sour
good
foaming
and
went
down
like
a
beer
average
taste
was
well
skunky
ballantine
has
a
better
flavor
and
is
way
cheaper
there
was
some
hop
bite
but
not
much
else
because
the
price
was
higher
because
this
seemed
like
a
heiny
ick
it
was
worth
trying
anyway
pours
a
clear
medium
gold
with
a
small
white
foamy
head
that
quickly
diminishes
to
a
thick
film
the
smell
is
lightly
skunky
and
cookielike
with
some
grassy
hops
the
taste
is
dry
and
fruity
with
more
light
skunk
on
the
finish
it
has
a
lightmedium
body
chalky
texture
and
lively
carbonation
a
pretty
typical
lowend
euro
that
relies
on
its
gimmick
more
than
its
quality
im
not
impressed
and
wont
be
getting
this
again
i
recommend
drinking
this
from
a
frozen
mug
the
taste
is
just
better
in
a
frozen
mug
for
this
one
i
have
tried
from
the
bottle
on
2
occassions
and
it
just
tastes
like
the
rest
of
the
holland
beers
from
a
mug
it
somehow
has
its
own
flavor
it
pours
a
thick
foamy
head
that
lasts
a
bit
before
dying
down
the
feel
is
average
and
it
has
some
skunk
smell
but
not
so
bad
not
bad
considering
it
is
fairly
cheap
compared
to
most
other
imports
i
would
try
grolsch
again
if
an
attractive
female
thrust
one
in
my
hand
but
i
wouldnt
pay
for
one
the
foul
smell
ruined
this
one
for
me
even
though
its
not
an
awful
taste
i
have
yet
to
find
a
euro
lager
ive
really
enjoyed
try
a
single
before
you
buy
a
6
pack
a
good
beer
made
by
the
netherlanders
in
general
is
good
and
recommendable
with
mexican
food
and
the
buddies
meeting
smell
good
its
well
balanced
hops
and
malt
its
vintage
bottle
made
a
touch
of
european
premium
beer
good
for
the
producers
in
my
country
is
rare
but
the
reward
is
good
taste
and
mothfeel
acceptable
neat
bottle
poured
a
pale
yellow
with
impressive
white
puffy
head
smell
is
very
minimal
and
could
not
really
be
detected
over
the
smells
in
the
restaurant
where
consumed
taste
was
very
dry
bitter
and
enjoyable
i
was
a
bit
suprised
good
and
crisp
finished
very
refreshing
while
not
my
favorite
style
of
beer
this
one
was
pretty
good
easy
drinking
paired
well
with
pork
loin
not
too
bad
this
has
a
flavor
that
somewhat
resembles
another
very
popular
european
lager
from
the
same
country
without
the
pronounced
skunkyness
it
looks
much
like
its
more
popular
cousin
the
mouthfeel
is
not
much
different
from
most
other
euro
lagers
and
is
equally
as
drinkable
overall
pretty
decent
not
too
bad
and
the
bottle
is
pretty
cool
sure
looks
like
a
pale
lager
its
pale
gold
with
a
blotchy
white
head
it
really
looks
remarkably
like
piss
smells
grainy
and
with
a
little
skunk
funk
tastes
cold
mouthfeel
is
actually
slightly
harsh
which
is
like
an
ugly
girl
not
shaving
her
legswith
what
its
got
to
offer
it
needs
all
the
help
it
can
get
drinkability
well
after
ten
of
these
youd
think
that
furry
chick
was
pretty
hot
but
the
problem
is
the
first
nine
dont
get
excited
but
dont
be
too
disappointed
i
would
put
this
ahead
of
heineken
no
doubt
and
i
like
heineken
as
far
a
euro
macros
go
overall
this
one
defintiely
surpassed
my
expectations
i
wouldnt
necessarily
go
out
and
buy
it
again
but
stacked
up
against
the
competition
its
definitely
a
step
ahead
look
smell
taste
etc
nothing
special
same
old
lager
drinakable
because
i
got
no
choice
basically
crappy
pours
a
vibrant
golden
color
with
a
frothy
white
head
smell
is
grassy
and
a
little
skunky
taste
is
grassy
a
little
skunky
and
predominantly
malty
gets
a
little
sweet
as
it
warms
not
a
bad
drinker
for
a
party
mouthfeel
is
bubbly
and
crisp
body
is
thin
but
drinkable
must
say
i
did
my
fair
share
in
polishing
off
that
bad
boy
last
night
it
comes
in
those
fun
swingtops
and
minikegs
as
well
id
have
to
say
it
tastes
best
out
of
the
keg
though
for
a
pale
lager
this
is
some
decent
stuff
if
you
dont
mind
a
bit
of
euro
skunk
euro
pale
lagers
are
one
of
my
least
favorite
styles
however
in
comparison
this
one
isnt
bad
its
refreshing
easy
to
down
a
not
too
complex
ill
buy
it
if
its
on
special
somewhere
its
bad
when
you
get
more
excited
over
the
bottle
that
the
beer
comes
in
than
you
do
the
beer
pours
a
pale
yellow
very
clear
highly
carbonated
beer
decent
head
that
gradually
fades
smells
of
noble
hops
partly
light
struck
and
modestly
sweet
flavors
are
subtle
and
mild
slight
cereal
grain
sweetness
light
malt
profile
hop
bittering
and
flavors
show
up
moreso
than
the
malt
causes
herbal
and
grassy
flavors
a
little
bready
and
yeasty
mild
grapefruit
and
pear
flavors
into
the
finish
light
feel
to
the
mouth
a
good
beer
to
chase
a
pizza
the
taste
was
clean
with
a
light
hop
presentce
mine
didnt
have
the
mouthfeel
of
something
overly
carbonated
the
beer
is
on
the
bland
side
but
less
than
some
of
its
competitors
within
this
category
has
always
tasted
to
me
it
is
easily
drinkable
because
of
its
light
mouthfeel
and
clean
taste
but
not
something
ill
be
reaching
for
again
because
of
a
personal
lack
of
interest
in
the
style
went
down
alright
but
i
can
honestly
say
that
the
swingtop
is
the
best
part
of
the
bottled
version
out
of
the
5l
mini
keg
it
isnt
bad
ill
give
it
another
go
in
the
future
to
see
if
i
got
a
bad
offering
i
use
to
like
this
beer
but
since
ive
been
drinking
imho
better
brews
this
stuff
basically
sucks
pours
a
yellow
color
with
lots
of
carbonation
and
alittle
head
but
leaves
basically
no
lacing
at
all
kinda
of
a
hoppy
scentskunky
light
to
medium
body
with
a
hoppy
aftertast
i
bought
two
bottles
but
will
be
hard
pressed
to
drink
them
both
is
it
just
me
or
does
that
herbal
smell
and
taste
kinda
remind
you
marijuana
it
poured
a
very
strawish
color
with
great
clarity
and
a
frothy
white
head
like
i
said
earlier
it
had
a
herbal
smell
reminiscent
of
marijuana
it
tasted
smooth
and
refreshing
and
still
reminded
me
of
marijuana
in
its
taste
but
also
other
sweet
and
skunky
herbs
i
enjoyed
this
beer
but
probably
would
not
order
it
again
as
nothing
really
stuck
out
about
it
with
the
exception
of
the
smell
ofcourse
good
to
excellent
all
aroound
brew
normal
apppearence
and
smell
for
the
style
of
beer
it
is
not
quite
as
bitter
was
i
was
expecting
still
an
overall
pretty
good
taste
my
favortie
is
still
beck
for
the
style
but
this
is
still
good
astringenty
taste
but
nothing
overly
excessive
felt
good
in
mouth
better
colder
though
also
for
drinkability
colder
the
better
cold
will
not
ruin
the
flavor
of
this
brew
and
will
make
is
go
down
easier
grolsch
is
a
very
drinkable
brew
it
has
a
nice
yellowish
copper
color
it
pour
with
a
one
finger
head
that
reduces
to
nil
after
a
couple
of
minutes
i
get
a
grainy
smell
kinda
skunky
this
could
be
from
the
stroage
of
the
beer
the
taste
is
what
you
would
expect
from
a
lager
it
has
a
very
bubbly
mouthfeel
good
and
refreshing
for
a
hot
day
pours
a
very
clear
amber
white
head
fades
quick
but
leaves
nice
lacing
smell
is
sweet
and
malty
mild
skunkiness
little
bit
of
citrus
hops
grassy
sweet
malt
skunky
middle
smooth
with
no
aftertaste
wouldnt
call
grolsch
bad
but
its
not
good
probably
one
of
the
better
generic
overpriced
eurolagers
appearance
is
light
golden
with
arctic
white
foam
that
leaves
plenty
of
lacing
aroma
is
barley
sulphur
and
herbal
hops
initial
taste
contains
a
silky
or
oily
coating
to
the
tongue
toast
broccoli
fresh
cut
grass
and
bitter
hops
this
strange
combination
continues
on
to
the
finish
which
leaves
a
slightly
sweet
taste
in
the
mouth
the
carbonation
is
fine
but
there
is
an
acerbic
bite
to
this
beer
that
prevents
one
from
wanting
another
might
be
good
with
sauerbraten
drinkability
i
can
have
several
especially
in
a
hot
summer
day
but
i
can
find
better
options
this
stuff
came
in
a
cool
bottle
with
a
snap
top
rubber
top
sweet
poured
out
to
a
nice
golden
color
with
good
carbonation
and
a
nice
enough
head
odors
of
burnt
hops
and
barley
were
noted
and
seemed
a
touch
on
the
skunky
side
but
everytime
ive
had
this
brew
its
been
there
so
i
guess
thats
how
its
supposed
to
be
flavor
was
well
enough
hops
and
earthy
flavors
were
present
as
was
a
zinc
like
taste
on
the
very
end
almost
like
swallowing
a
vitamin
without
water
not
a
good
thing
finished
smooth
and
crisp
there
are
better
lagers
out
there
but
this
isnt
bad
and
worthy
of
a
try
it
pours
a
bright
dark
golden
hue
coming
with
a
very
foamy
and
pillowy
thick
whte
head
sustaining
thoughout
the
drink
due
to
fierce
carbonation
i
reckon
the
nose
is
floating
and
refreshing
aroma
of
biscuity
mals
and
grassy
limepeel
like
hops
the
taste
is
slightly
more
pronounced
than
the
aromamediumcitrusy
hops
and
butterbiscuity
mals
leading
to
quite
round
bittersweetness
at
the
back
and
a
quite
inense
mouthfeel
of
dryish
bitterness
in
the
finish
though
not
lingering
well
the
overall
mouthfeel
is
soft
and
the
aftertaste
round
and
mild
as
opposed
to
its
fizzy
outlook
but
the
flavour
could
certainly
have
been
richer
to
be
tasty
still
an
easy
drinking
thirstquenching
beer
though
at
the
expense
of
richer
bitterness
and
maltiness
i
can
go
for
skunk
once
in
a
while
and
this
is
probably
the
best
skunky
beer
ive
ever
had
if
it
wasnt
so
damn
expensive
i
might
consider
using
this
for
session
drinking
at
parties
flavor
contains
the
same
off
sharpness
but
its
more
subdued
and
easier
to
handle
malty
bitter
lemon
grassy
a
little
oily
as
well
as
the
sharpness
at
the
back
and
sides
of
the
mouth
ok
on
a
hot
day
but
not
a
classic
drinkability
not
something
i
would
necessarily
turn
down
if
offered
but
would
not
pick
it
if
i
had
a
choice
thats
some
catchy
stuff
pours
a
golden
colour
with
a
large
foamy
white
head
sweet
malt
aromas
some
skunk
taste
was
decent
malty
sweetness
with
a
dry
bitter
aftertaste
hops
balance
the
beer
herbal
smooth
and
refreshing
better
than
the
average
euro
lager
had
from
a
1
5
l
bottle
refreshing
very
easy
to
drink
should
be
a
good
hot
weather
or
pizza
beer
the
smell
is
grassy
and
sweet
typical
of
a
lager
imo
the
taste
is
neither
hoppy
nor
malty
the
taste
is
very
mild
with
not
many
distinquishing
characteristics
a
smooth
standby
that
probably
goes
well
with
food
as
it
is
kind
of
light
reasonably
good
mouthfeel
good
carbonation
level
drinkable
but
not
something
id
go
back
for
time
and
again
grolsch
is
about
as
average
as
a
eurolager
gets
likeable
and
friendly
it
will
always
be
welcome
to
come
over
and
hang
out
once
in
a
while
i
paid
3
49
per
bottle
every
time
i
go
to
a
get
together
i
try
to
bring
some
samplers
with
me
its
kind
of
embarassing
at
first
but
once
you
get
someone
to
try
anything
other
the
usual
coors
bud
or
miller
youre
kind
of
always
on
the
vip
list
grolsh
is
a
good
beer
to
start
someone
off
in
the
right
direction
i
know
its
mass
produced
but
so
are
beemers
and
look
at
them
compared
to
a
tin
can
cadillac
europeans
seem
to
take
a
little
more
pride
in
what
they
do
and
compared
to
the
mass
produced
garbage
made
in
the
u
s
if
this
is
one
of
europes
lawn
mower
beers
i
wouldnt
mind
getting
a
grass
cutting
job
in
holland
this
beer
has
a
nice
light
appearance
and
doesnt
have
to
be
chilled
with
nitrogen
to
enjoy
the
aroma
is
consistent
with
most
beers
that
come
in
a
green
bottle
sort
of
skunky
although
im
a
fan
of
strong
browns
i
can
get
used
to
the
refreshing
taste
of
this
brew
winter
or
summer
the
mouthfeel
is
clean
and
drinkability
is
good
a
lot
smoother
than
heineken
which
is
more
hoppy
i
can
down
a
bunch
of
these
unlike
bud
or
coors
and
almost
never
wake
up
with
my
head
in
a
vise
this
grog
is
widely
available
in
my
area
and
its
not
overly
priced
making
it
a
good
choice
to
have
if
the
fridge
in
case
your
miller
buddies
stop
over
if
youre
one
of
the
big
three
drinkers
do
us
all
a
favor
instead
of
spending
your
cash
on
piss
water
which
only
funds
commercials
that
jam
up
the
air
waves
buy
a
case
of
grolsch
trust
me
youll
never
have
a
windmill
advertisement
interrupt
your
favorite
tv
show
there
was
a
guy
at
his
little
sample
booth
hand
out
six
packs
of
grolsch
like
it
was
the
cool
new
beer
i
havent
had
a
bottle
of
this
beer
in
quite
awhile
but
i
found
myself
at
the
till
with
a
six
pack
in
my
hand
you
know
this
is
still
one
of
the
better
mass
produced
euro
lagers
that
can
be
found
anywhere
grassy
fresh
and
well
finished
i
will
try
not
to
make
it
another
five
years
before
i
try
this
again
im
pleased
to
see
that
this
is
becoming
more
available
perhaps
one
day
some
fortunate
soul
will
mistake
a
bottle
of
this
for
a
bottle
of
heineken
and
become
a
convert
smells
of
grass
or
fresh
cut
hayfield
and
a
bit
of
a
skunky
smell
the
taste
is
more
or
the
same
earthy
and
grassy
with
a
skunk
taste
i
dont
really
like
this
beer
it
pours
a
pale
brown
with
nice
bubbles
and
carbonation
the
only
thing
interesting
about
the
beer
is
the
bottle
itself
the
grolsch
bottle
is
different
and
very
interesting
drinkability
average
but
i
have
to
say
this
beer
got
its
own
personnality
and
it
seems
to
be
exceptionnal
for
an
euro
pale
lager
pale
this
beer
is
pretty
much
a
decent
euro
pale
lager
nothing
overwhelming
just
a
good
beer
to
drink
with
a
hearty
meal
drinkability
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
when
its
good
and
fresh
its
very
good
and
drinkable
however
due
to
the
green
bottles
lightstruck
beer
and
what
i
think
is
an
occasional
bad
seal
on
the
swing
top
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
gets
bad
in
a
hurry
purchase
at
you
own
risk
unless
you
buy
from
a
reputable
store
that
you
know
the
stock
is
good
ive
seen
the
regular
crown
caps
but
have
never
purchased
these
before
i
guess
i
just
like
the
swingtop
too
much
to
me
its
unique
man
skunk
city
ive
had
beers
that
were
questionable
about
skunk
but
now
i
know
what
it
is
poured
out
straw
coloredwith
a
2
finger
head
pale
grainy
taste
with
slight
hop
ending
with
metallic
aftertaste
not
a
very
appealing
beerbut
a
cool
reusable
bottle
ok
stuff
this
is
good
for
one
or
two
when
nothing
better
is
available
altogether
not
too
bad
and
fairly
cheap
drinkin
though
why
must
they
screw
the
drinker
out
of
that
8
beer
emptys
great
for
homebrewing
although
this
is
their
principal
money
maker
they
offer
several
fine
beers

carries
on
to
the
taste
slight

taste
is
a
grassy

lager
like
so
many
i
have
had
gets
all
3s
for
not
being
bad
but
not
bring
ing
anything
new
to
the
style
flavor
is
not
as
expected
with
little
to
no
skunk
i
get
grainy
malt
and
earthy
and
spicy
hops
the
sweet
malt
starts
the
beer
and
the
hops
bring
up
the
rear
the
beer
is
crisp
and
refreshing
and
less
skunky
than
the
nose
advertises
just
not
very
exciting
i
think
this
one
would
pair
well
with
seafood
shellfish
and
chips
pours
a
pale
straw
pils
color
with
an
adequate
head
nice
lacing
too
white
bready
in
its
malt
some
spicy
hops
and
an
underlying
mustiness
mostly
make
up
the
aroma
its
actually
quite
good
when
you
know
you
have
a
fresh
to
the
u
s
bottle
it
is
rather
thin
overall
but
the
dull
malt
crispness
and
the
spiciness
from
the
saaz
hops
really
tie
the
whole
beer
into
one
drinkable
knot
provided
the
drinker
is
thirsty
for
a
pale
lager
smooth
head
when
poured
dutchstyle
it
seems
only
certain
northern
european
pale
lagers
have
a
potable
head
domestic
beers
have
a
less
creamy
head
big
hoppygrassy
taste
not
very
refreshing
taste
a
little
different
but
not
necessarily
good
bottle
is
cool
473ml
seems
a
random
capacity
but
the
bottles
are
perfect
for
sticking
home
brews
in
overall
its
ok
but
its
sad
when
youre
buying
a
beer
for
the
bottle
it
comes
in
overalli
like
the
aggressive
grainy
flavor
of
this
brew
combined
with
spicy
hops
it
makes
for
an
interesting
kick
however
the
skunk
here
is
far
more
than
im
used
too
which
hurts
it
plus
it
could
go
down
a
little
bit
smoother
give
this
beer
a
shot
though
it
is
distinctive
for
me
thus
far
among
the
euro
pales
underlying
buttery
sweetness
starts
to
come
out
as
it
warms
a
bit
not
bad
really
while
cold
fairly
crisp
but
nothing
outstanding
its
a
good
beer
to
buy
if
you
like
this
type
of
beer
and
if
it
is
on
sale
i
would
never
get
a
craving
for
this
particular
beer
what
im
trying
to
say
is
its
good
enough
to
drink
and
enjoy
but
not
enough
to
actively
seek
out
if
i
feel
like
this
sort
of
beer
and
i
have
the
choice
between
this
and
its
major
competion
i
would
consider
price
in
the
equation
but
if
the
price
were
the
same
id
very
rarely
drink
it
bottle
poured
a
golden
colored
beer
with
a
small
bubbly
white
head
with
very
little
retention
carbonation
is
quite
low
which
is
not
what
i
would
expect
from
a
premium
lager
aroma
is
quite
weak
with
maybe
some
malt
in
the
background
taste
is
also
quite
weak
with
some
skunky
taste
at
the
end
instead
of
dryness
overall
lack
of
crispness
with
funky
taste
at
the
end
not
one
i
will
be
seeking
again
anytime
soon
drinkability
i
really
cant
envision
a
scenario
in
which
i
can
ever
see
myself
drinking
this
beer
again
a
cool
looking
bottle
for
my
collection
thats
the
only
thing
i
got
out
of
the
grolsch
experience
in
person
it
is
the
expectable
eurolager
colour
but
i
was
really
quite
dissapointed
with
its
lack
of
head
it
seems
like
i
can
taste
butterry
flavours
in
it
which
are
usually
a
massive
beer
nono
well
at
least
they
are
in
homebrew
and
the
finish
isnt
quite
as
spectacular
as
i
recall
it
being
either
it
tastes
strange
to
me
will
have
to
update
this
review
when
next
get
a
chance
to
try
it
as
am
not
sure
whether
there
is
anything
wrong
with
the
beer
andor
my
sample
bottle
of
it
or
whether
it
just
isnt
quite
as
much
of
a
xerox
as
many
other
eurolagers
all
around
a
solid
beer
but
i
really
would
have
liked
just
a
bit
more
oomph
pours
a
normal
gold
with
a
shiny
white
head
that
dissapears
pretty
quick
with
no
trace
of
lacing
smells
like
a
3day
old
dead
skunk
damn
green
bottles
taste
isnt
too
bad
a
little
above
average
tastes
of
grains
breads
and
hops
nothing
spectacular
feels
a
little
too
carbonated
in
the
mouth
but
not
horrible
has
a
bit
of
a
nasty
aftertaste
i
could
see
myself
sitting
with
a
6
pack
of
this
here
and
there
worth
a
try
if
not
too
much
else
is
available
this
beer
pours
a
pale
yellow
color
with
a
dimunitive
shortlived
head
and
no
lace
to
speak
of
the
aroma
is
of
grainy
malts
fresh
cut
hay
and
a
slight
hoppyness
the
taste
starts
off
with
a
hit
of
hop
bitterness
and
bread
and
lingers
into
a
malty
sweetness
theres
a
little
bit
of
detergentmedicinal
flavor
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
plain
subtle
and
average
this
beer
is
average
all
over
it
has
no
standout
qualities
but
also
no
serious
defects
a
little
bland
though
taste
is
smooth
at
first
with
a
peppery
finish
very
clean
tasting
brew
that
tastes
grassy
and
grainy
the
beer
pours
a
clear
golden
yellow
color
with
about
a
finger
of
head
that
falls
to
slight
cover
over
the
beer
the
nose
is
much
better
than
i
remember
so
maybe
i
got
a
fresher
bottle
im
not
getting
much
of
the
skunk
i
associate
with
this
beer
what
a
surprise
the
nose
does
seem
a
bit
weak
to
me
as
well
im
getting
the
malty
sweetness
but
not
much
of
anything
else
there
is
an
aftertase
to
this
one
that
i
dont
like
its
bitter
but
not
in
a
good
way
as
with
a
good
ipa
i
dont
know
what
it
is
but
i
dont
like
it
i
cant
get
past
that
the
beer
is
about
a
moderate
thickness
with
a
good
carb
on
it
i
dont
think
i
want
more
than
one
of
these
every
year
or
so
its
just
not
my
favorite
the
best
part
is
that
you
can
always
find
some
of
these
in
a
pinch
when
you
are
at
the
local
lcbo
not
bad
pours
a
clear
yellow
with
a
frothy
foamy
white
head
the
smell
is
very
grainy
hints
of
corn
and
sourdough
slight
skunk
as
well
the
taste
is
suprisingly
a
great
combo
of
light
malts
and
grain
a
pleasing
refreshing
lager
light
bodied
and
refreshing
to
the
taste
suprisingly
decent
my
advice
is
to
drink
grolsch
premium
lager
icecold
or
not
at
all
preferably
the
latter
im
sure
that
the
netherlands
can
do
better
than
this
mouthfeel
is
decent
but
overall
this
bev
is
not
quite
right
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
imports
not
only
is
it
as
smooth
as
can
be
but
corkhinged
pop
top
is
the
coolest
bottle
i
may
have
ever
seen
above
average
on
every
level
exceptional
on
any
either
drinkability
is
probably
the
low
point
of
the
beer
as
after
6
or
so
an
odd
aftertaste
begins
to
develop
an
overall
great
brew
overall
a
very
nice
appearance
wonderful
to
the
nose
pleasing
taste
due
to
its
balanced
use
of
hops
and
grains
aftertaste
is
slightly
acidic
but
on
a
whole
very
nice
overall
acceptable
lager
but
given
the
pricevalue
im
not
sure
what
occasions
or
drinkers
it
fits
always
seems
to
be
on
special
at
my
local
bw3s
i
guess
they
dont
move
a
lot
of
them
pours
a
standard
golden
straw
color
with
a
medium
sized
white
head
has
the
same
general
smell
as
a
heineken
left
in
the
sun
maybe
the
skunkiness
lends
some
flavor
to
this
beer
there
is
a
little
bitterness
coming
through
but
nothing
too
major
mouthfeel
is
nothing
special
and
neither
is
drinkability
i
cant
picture
myself
sessioning
this
one
it
wont
be
my
first
choice
for
a
lager
but
probably
a
minute
step
above
the
bmc
crowd
the
body
and
finish
is
like
tonic
water
the
bitterness
isnt
bad
for
a
pale
lager
not
memorablea
beer
i
only
enjoy
drinking
if
out
at
a
bar
that
doesnt
serve
anything
better
i
hate
county
music
it
annoys
me
for
me
i
much
prefer
more
extreme
heavy
music
then
a
certain
song
by
garth
brooks
comes
along
no
idea
the
name
of
it
that
my
wife
plays
all
the
time
and
for
some
reason
i
really
like
that
one
song
i
dont
like
any
others
but
i
really
dig
that
song
similarily
lagers
are
really
boring
to
me
for
the
most
part
i
like
extreme
beers
like
my
music
now
unlike
county
music
it
dont
hate
lagers
but
they
usually
dont
stand
out
to
me
like
a
stout
or
barleywine
often
does
grolsch
is
my
exception
i
love
grolsch
from
the
moment
i
pop
off
the
top
i
can
smell
that
smell
i
know
so
well
theres
a
distinctive
taste
that
no
other
lager
has
like
a
grolsch
slightly
sweet
at
first
finishing
with
an
even
slighter
hoppiness
simple
very
drinkable
fantastic
yellow
color
with
an
unimpressive
head
thats
gone
before
you
know
it
smell
is
sulferish
consistant
with
its
green
bottle
and
so
is
the
taste
trouble
is
many
people
have
grown
to
like
that
taste
in
beer
not
me
mouthfeel
is
dry
and
unsubstantial
best
thing
about
this
beer
is
the
bottle
in
a
word
craptacular
the
actual
taste
is
momentary
it
enters
the
mouth
you
try
to
get
a
feel
for
it
and
the
flavor
is
gone
i
found
a
unique
way
to
enjoy
this
beer
at
a
coast
guard
package
store
i
found
boxes
that
came
with
two
mini
kegsi
dont
remeber
but
it
seemed
like
24galons
of
grolsch
it
was
an
intresting
way
to
have
it
but
the
taste
was
vey
similar
to
the
bottled
brew
an
easy
to
drink
beer
overall
its
very
average
nothing
too
special
to
make
it
stand
out
from
other
lagers
a
pleasant
enough
quaffer
grolsch
lager
is
your
basic
euro
lager
not
much
to
write
home
about
however
it
is
better
than
that
other
green
bottled
beer
from
holland
appearance
is
a
fine
clear
golden
with
a
white
sticky
cap
the
smell
if
not
skunked
is
a
fairly
mild
sweetness
i
had
an
unskunked
bottle
the
taste
is
pleasant
but
unremarkable
slightly
sweet
with
a
hint
of
grassyness
its
a
quaffable
beer
and
a
step
up
from
us
macro
lager
i
would
really
like
to
try
this
on
tap
in
holland
i
expect
that
that
would
be
a
completely
different
experience
drinkability
smooth
drinker
overall
if
you
can
make
friends
with
its
unique
character
nothing
very
exciting
but
a
very
decent
brew
the
freshness
of
hops
in
this
beer
definately
carry
the
day
very
drinkable
pours
to
a
clear
golden
nectar
good
lasting
lacing
the
lagering
is
quite
apparent
in
the
carbonation
that
rises
slowly
throughout
the
bowl
and
effervesces
on
the
top
the
primary
nose
for
me
is
one
of
slightly
sweet
caramel
the
hops
are
evident
but
not
oppressive
imparting
a
bitterness
that
one
would
expect
in
a
european
premium
lager
this
beer
is
substantial
and
fizzy
on
the
tongue
but
not
bitey
i
like
this
beer
i
could
drink
it
at
session
and
i
could
recommend
it
to
others
without
reservation
vague
sweetness
with
a
pinching
bitter
copper
the
aftertaste
is
slightly
more
coffee
and
salt
withim
not
kiddingthe
taste
of
envelope
glue
a
lingering
aftertaste
that
emphasizes
the
bitter
qualities
this
is
what
disappoints
me
mostthe
bitter
is
nice
but
the
sweet
that
begins
is
so
faint
that
it
strikes
me
as
unbalanced
not
bad
not
great
just
sort
of
lingering
in
the
middle
precariously
ok
this
was
a
bad
beer
i
might
have
gotten
a
crap
bottle
but
it
was
more
skunk
than
anything
for
me
it
was
strong
in
the
smell
all
i
got
was
skunkness
smell
with
nothing
else
to
back
it
up
the
taste
was
similar
but
had
more
on
the
malt
side
mixed
with
the
strong
skunk
esscence
i
was
sure
that
it
was
going
to
be
that
way
when
i
saw
the
green
bottle
all
i
can
say
is
thank
god
it
was
free
to
me
ive
always
enjoyed
this
beer
and
i
hadnt
tried
it
in
quite
some
time
it
is
still
fresh
and
crisp
and
would
rank
about
halfway
between
a
becks
and
a
pilsner
urquell
looks
as
good
as
most
pils
or
lagers
and
has
a
nice
if
somewhat
mild
flavor
very
good
balance
this
is
my
entry
level
beer
out
at
a
restaraunt
i
would
be
happy
with
it
always
get
the
corked
bottle
nothing
bad
to
say
just
not
in
the
class
of
the
best
beers
of
the
style
sinkability

im
pouring
this
one
down
the
garbage
disposal
along
with
last
weeks
tuna
casserole
a
decent
brew
and
a
unique
bottle
pours
fizzy
yellow
mild
hop
flavour
good
enough
before
a
pizza
or
pasta
meal
fine
with
it
crisp
light
smooth
best
in
summer
first
sip
is
the
best
bitter
aftertaste
good
volume
beer
for
the
gang
slightly
better
than
north
american
national
brands
all
in
all
this
is
a
harsh
flavorful
brew
not
an
everyday
beer
for
me
but
good
with
some
spicier
foods
paid
4
99
for
a
6
pack
of
16ozers
overall
a
very
average
beer
looks
good
with
decent
head
retention
for
its
kind
aroma
is
sweet
malt
grassy
hops
and
synthetic
rubber
flavor
is
mostly
harsh
hop
bitterness
astringency
in
the
mouthfeel
and
little
else
finishes
dry
bitter
chalky
i
used
to
like
this
beer
but
not
enough
to
buy
it
again
and
again
the
main
attraction
must
have
only
been
the
swingtop
bottles
this
is
fine
not
outstanding
but
a
nice
thisrt
quencher
bitterness
lingers
little
too
long
and
isnt
pleasant
enough
tasting
this
is
one
of
the
better
lagers
i
have
had
from
overseas
i
had
it
the
first
time
in
amsterdam
and
i
canb
say
that
the
bottle
here
in
the
states
keps
the
flavor
well
unlike
heineken
it
is
extremely
smooth
and
a
bit
buttery
has
a
grainy
grass
like
taste
as
well
but
is
overcome
by
the
smoothness
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
pours
out
a
pale
yellow
with
a
white
head
that
shrinks
to
a
thin
but
firm
head
there
is
a
slight
smell
of
malt
at
the
beginning
and
an
aftertaste
of
hops
in
the
end
it
is
a
good
lager
that
has
taste
it
is
one
of
the
better
dutch
lagers
in
a
world
full
of
lagers
a
very
very
typical
euro
pale
yellow
fizzy
whit
head
that
doesnt
last
touch
of
malt
and
some
hops
nothing
to
write
home
about
nice
bottle
though
one
thing
to
note
i
detected
a
lot
i
mean
a
lot
of
honey
flavor
if
its
consumed
from
a
5
liter
mini
keg
as
opposed
to
the
bottle
doing
this
gives
the
beer
a
lot
more
character
and
it
tastes
pretty
damn
good
this
way
it
pours
a
nice
golden
color
with
a
thin
white
head
that
doesnt
stick
around
very
long
it
has
a
skunky
aroma
that
isnt
very
good
at
least
to
my
taste
the
taste
follows
the
nose
skunky
grassy
malt
not
a
bad
mouthfeel
but
still
not
impressive
overall
nothing
special
its
a
drinkable
beer
but
nothing
to
conversate
about
at
least
i
have
four
new
fliptops
for
my
homebrew
the
flavor
is
a
combination
of
bitterness
and
cooked
veggies
although
not
incredibly
strong
this
is
a
beer
that
i
would
drink
agian
if
i
were
dying
of
thirst
if
not
then
there
are
many
other
passable
choices
even
at
a
bar
with
a
bad
selection
far
below
average
lager
bought
the
single
swing
top
bottle
hey
that
was
neat
its
also
the
highlight
of
the
beer
and
i
havent
even
poured
it
yet
lets
see
somewhat
darker
than
gold
colour
alot
of
carbonation
and
yet
very
little
head
what
was
their
did
leave
a
little
lace
on
my
glass
whoa
bad
smell
cooked
vegetables
wet
malt
little
hops
soggy
cardboard
and
skunk
juice
hmm
green
bottle
skunked
beer
who
would
see
that
coming
very
bad
taste
skunky
taste
up
front
cooked
veggie
taste
in
the
middle
bitter
skunk
aftertaste
thin
overcarbonated
mouthfeel
i
would
not
drink
this
again
even
if
it
were
offered
for
free
id
choose
something
else
even
bud
light
at
least
the
taste
in
bud
light
isnt
skunk
fizzy
beer
gold
color
large
fizzy
head
aroma
is
dms
wet
cardboard
and
flavor
is
matly
and
slightly
hoppy
but
is
obscured
by
the
green
bottle
skunkyness
bad
bottle
possibly
i
have
tried
this
beer
several
times
and
it
always
taste
like
this
some
more
some
less
average
lager
but
this
one
was
undrinkable
ng
i
must
say
i
did
not
like
grolsch
very
much
it
had
a
very
bitter
taste
at
the
end
of
the
beer
which
quickly
turned
me
off
to
it
it
was
a
bit
dry
with
the
bitter
also
i
was
excited
because
i
found
a
case
of
it
really
cheap
so
i
bought
it
but
did
not
like
it
much
luckily
my
father
helped
me
take
the
case
down
this
is
a
very
average
beer
that
fits
into
the
heinekenbecks
euro
mold
and
does
nothing
to
distinguish
itself
a
cheap
domestic
macro
can
be
had
for
less
and
is
probably
better
tasting
too
this
is
one
of
the
better
lagers
on
the
market
today
it
pours
rather
unimpressive
and
the
smell
is
pretty
much
nonexistant
yet
the
taste
is
highly
satisfying
it
is
crisp
and
smooth
with
a
nice
bitter
hops
flavor
this
is
probally
the
best
of
the
well
known
lagers
however
it
is
a
bit
too
pricey
this
beer
pours
a
light
amber
color
out
of
the
regular
capped
bottle
with
little
head
and
no
lacing
on
the
glass
i
really
cant
smell
anything
at
all
in
the
aroma
there
is
something
but
it
is
too
faint
to
tell
what
it
is
the
flavor
is
a
little
malty
and
there
are
faint
hints
of
spices
but
it
is
pretty
plain
i
had
one
of
these
long
ago
with
the
semicorked
top
and
remember
it
being
much
better
perhaps
i
just
got
a
skunky
one
this
time
around
its
ok
but
nothing
i
would
pay
an
import
price
for
12
oz
bottle
poured
just
slightly
darker
than
most
macros
with
very
little
head
leaves
some
fine
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
was
skunk
probably
from
the
green
bottle
which
dissipated
after
a
few
minutes
taste
was
nothing
to
cheer
about
malts
and
hops
low
carbonation
and
a
very
bitter
finish
an
ok
beer
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
drink
it
another
beer
for
the
masses
golden
pour
with
a
white
head
that
fades
the
nose
moderatley
hoppy
and
floral
the
taste
is
lightly
hopped
with
a
slighly
sweet
and
light
caramel
finish
some
bitterness
a
little
more
body
than
your
average
massbrew
i
dont
mind
grolsch
too
much
i
pretty
much
accept
it
for
what
it
is
a
plain
lager
that
pours
your
average
golden
tone
with
a
plain
head
that
fades
eventually
leaving
a
thin
layer
and
some
lacing
the
smell
strong
and
not
very
appealing
has
a
lot
of
hops
to
it
the
taste
a
poor
combination
of
hops
and
malt
doesnt
even
have
a
nice
mouth
feel
as
there
is
very
little
carbonation
in
itself
good
i
tried
it
and
learned
the
beer
pours
a
pretty
typical
fizzy
yellow
color
the
aroma
has
a
bit
of
fruity
hop
aroma
to
it
but
not
too
much
the
taste
is
pretty
devoid
of
any
maltiness
but
it
does
have
a
bit
of
a
bitterness
to
it
the
taste
is
even
slightly
sour
good
lager
smoothness
far
from
the
best
out
there
but
a
lot
better
than
most
of
them
pours
from
the
distinctive
bottle
a
pale
golden
color
with
bubbles
rising
quickly
to
a
12inch
high
offwhite
head
the
head
lingers
briefly
the
aroma
is
of
hop
sweet
malt
and
some
floral
the
malt
flavor
comes
through
right
away
followed
by
a
mild
hop
finish
with
hints
of
pine
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
is
capped
off
with
a
slight
tingle
on
the
tiip
of
the
tongue
drinkability
is
hgh
this
beer
is
better
than
average
in
all
respects
i
tasted
this
only
for
the
flip
top
bottle
homebrewing
and
the
review
pours
a
medium
gold
with
little
to
no
head
moderately
carbonated
with
tiny
rising
bubbles
like
ginger
ale
even
mild
rough
maltiness
and
a
hint
of
flowery
hop
aroma
even
mild
maltiness
with
uninteresting
bittering
hops
mouthfeel
starts
smoothe
but
finishes
with
a
grainy
maltiness
this
is
not
skunky
like
heini
thin
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
not
a
lot
of
carbonation
mild
skunky
nose
that
isnt
as
bad
as
many
euro
lagers
of
the
region
its
almost
welcoming
herbal
scent
of
hops
with
a
faint
hint
of
salad
and
a
ghostly
metallic
aroma
taste
is
also
a
bit
metallic
light
malt
flavour
with
mild
hop
finish
a
little
dry
a
very
smooth
lager
goes
down
easy
it
wont
win
any
blue
ribbons
nothing
exceptional
but
i
like
to
buy
a
few
for
nice
hot
days
the
grolsch
poured
a
clear
golden
with
a
nice
white
head
that
i
didnt
expectin
the
least
but
was
pretty
and
staying
leaving
terrific
rings
around
the
inside
of
the
glass
there
were
very
faint
aromas
a
thin
alcohol
scent
pervaded
the
drink
was
crisp
and
bitter
with
a
dry
hop
that
was
well
pronounced
but
not
really
a
feature
there
were
fresh
greens
in
the
flavor
and
i
couldnt
help
but
think
it
was
celery
but
i
wouldnt
say
that
as
a
conviction
it
was
a
golden
flavor
the
mouthfeel
was
crisp
and
full
of
tiny
bubbles
the
burp
was
clean
and
these
lent
to
a
great
drinkability
i
was
again
quite
supprised
at
the
fact
that
it
wasnt
skunky
great
beer
shit
thanks
for
reading
my
review
this
is
a
smooth
drinking
lager
beer
i
drank
this
very
quickly
froma
slightly
chilled
pint
mug
ill
be
back
came
in
a
sampler
12
pk
for
8
bucks
not
bad
its
a
very
clear
pale
yellow
with
a
foamy
white
head
i
believe
if
you
looked
up
beer
in
the
dictionary
youd
see
a
picture
of
my
mug
next
to
the
definition
smell
is
tademark
holland
skunky
with
not
much
else
to
speak
of
taste
is
crisp
and
somewhat
hoppy
slightly
floral
not
a
very
strong
tasting
brew
but
pleasant
fairly
watery
and
easy
to
drink
but
not
something
im
gonna
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
a
good
session
brew
if
nothing
else
choose
this
one
when
the
gangs
coming
over
and
you
need
high
volume
yet
decent
quality
do
you
like
heine
do
you
like
st
pauli
do
you
like
becks
if
so
then
youll
like
grolsch
very
similar
to
the
style
of
those
beers
i
prefer
grolsch
to
those
because
grolsch
isnt
quite
as
bitter
despite
the
small
difference
grolsch
will
taste
very
familiar
even
if
youve
never
had
it
this
brew
had
a
good
head
on
it
the
lacing
was
fair
it
had
a
hoppy
aroma
it
had
a
bitter
aftertaste
that
seemed
to
linger
this
brew
was
drinkable
but
it
was
not
an
outstanding
brew
in
my
opinion
this
is
not
a
brew
that
i
would
go
out
and
order
if
i
had
the
chance
to
do
so
exceptional
just
a
decent
brew
mouthfell
is
just
about
right
i
guess
you
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
but
your
money
would
be
better
spent
elsewhere
taste
is
nicely
balanced
with
very
little
sweetness
the
finish
is
bitter
with
the
bitterness
lasting
into
the
aftertaste
a
smooth
mouthfeel
with
a
little
astringency
this
would
probably
go
well
with
pizza
i
would
buy
this
again
if
i
wanted
a
warmweather
or
spicy
food
lager
or
just
as
a
rare
changeup
from
ale
more
flavor
and
less
skunk
than
most
of
its
competitors
i
was
expecting
something
like
heineken
but
boy
was
i
surprised
this
is
good
stuff
it
poured
a
distinct
dark
amber
with
a
modest
head
the
taste
is
bold
for
a
euro
lager
taste
is
malty
and
smooth
decent
hoppiness
i
liked
this
a
lot
and
will
drink
it
again
for
a
cool
change
from
typical
boring
green
bottles
its
better
than
your
average
macro
swill
thats
for
sure
but
still
falls
short
of
being
a
good
beer
nice
creamy
head
not
overly
carbonated
like
most
macros
can
be
taste
is
a
little
skunky
but
thats
to
be
expected
from
these
damm
green
bottles
aroma
is
a
little
spicy
with
a
clean
crisp
finish
its
not
the
best
lager
on
the
market
but
its
definatly
not
the
worst
poured
a
light
golden
color
with
a
frothy
white
head
that
dissappeared
rather
quickly
however
the
lacing
was
decent
as
soon
as
i
popped
the
cap
i
was
overwhelmed
with
a
skunky
bittery
aroma
after
the
pour
the
aroma
became
more
complex
picking
up
some
malty
sweetness
the
taste
was
nothing
special
a
very
herbal
taste
probably
from
the
hops
a
little
sweet
up
front
with
bittery
finish
this
brew
is
nice
and
smooth
the
astrigency
of
the
alcohol
comes
through
especially
in
the
aftertaste
which
is
pretty
dry
i
would
drink
this
brew
again
but
it
would
not
be
something
i
would
purchase
again
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
the
noble
hops
dominating
the
flavor
and
aroma
makes
this
lager
much
more
pleasant
for
me
than
the
bohemian
pilsners
once
again
the
pour
a
typical
gold
color
the
head
average
in
size
brilliant
white
in
color
the
lace
adequate
to
cover
the
glass
nose
is
malt
sweet
fresh
and
clean
with
the
star
cloyingly
sweet
fair
to
middling
malt
presence
and
the
top
thin
finish
mild
in
its
carbonation
hops
presence
but
mild
aftertaste
dry
a
drinkable
but
only
average
and
i
am
reaching
for
this
one
as
i
really
find
it
weak
the
pour
produced
a
skunky
aroma
that
filled
the
room
a
straw
yellow
fizzy
body
and
a
moderate
white
head
that
left
minimal
lacing
initial
taste
had
some
of
the
skunky
aroma
on
the
tongue
but
it
got
less
annoying
after
that
ending
was
quite
dry
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
foamy
and
creamy
white
head
that
fades
into
a
nice
lace
nose
is
sweet
malts
and
stale
grains
clean
and
crisp
in
the
mouth
with
tastes
of
fresh
bready
malts
lightly
spiced
hops
and
a
touch
of
honey
a
very
refreshing
brew
that
pairs
nicely
with
anything
spicy
once
you
get
past
the
aroma
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
ive
avoided
grolsch
for
quite
some
time
because
popular
opinion
deems
it
on
par
with
that
other
big
selling
beer
from
holland
but
this
couldnt
be
further
from
the
truth
according
to
my
humble
buds
okay
so
the
nose
is
a
bit
disconcerting
perhaps
like
washing
your
socks
in
stewing
wort
but
the
taste
more
than
makes
up
for
it
toasty
rounded
fed
pickled
hops
the
night
through
i
couldnt
pound
a
whole
lot
of
these
no
but
i
wouldnt
turn
one
down
either
i
love
the
swing
top
bottles
except
for
the
fact
that
they
replaced
the
ceramic
part
with
a
plastic
part
when
i
was
in
college
we
did
some
crazy
stuff
with
that
ceramic
part
anyways
the
beer
is
good
for
nostalgia
purposes
plus
its
not
a
bad
lager
the
sample
i
tasted
was
from
the
large
1
5
liter
bottle
with
the
well
known
swing
cap
top
some
care
must
be
taken
in
pouring
as
there
was
an
abundance
of
carbonation
the
head
lasted
until
the
glass
was
empty
there
was
a
distinct
hop
bite
upfront
the
palate
was
clean
with
very
little
mouthfeel
there
was
a
dry
finish
to
the
beer
with
an
aftertaste
that
lasted
long
after
consuming
the
beer
there
was
however
a
slight
off
taste
noticed
in
the
finish
after
consuming
about
one
liter
of
the
brew
to
me
this
beer
would
be
best
enjoyed
with
food
that
stimulates
the
tastebuds
such
as
a
new
york
or
german
hot
sausage
it
was
also
a
bit
pricey
for
the
product
received
the
taste
is
less
then
appetizing
bad
skunky
taste
to
go
with
the
skunk
aroma
poured
a
dark
clear
golden
color
with
a
white
foamy
head
that
disappeared
quickly
aroma
was
of
malt
hops
with
a
slight
skunkiness
that
worsened
as
the
beer
warmed
taste
was
crisp
with
a
sweet
malt
front
that
turned
into
a
sour
lemony
middle
and
a
finish
that
was
bitter
and
skunky
ive
had
this
in
the
past
and
i
dont
remember
grolsch
being
this
distasteful
expiration
was
marked
072003
but
this
bottle
was
just
plain
awful
with
so
many
options
out
there
i
dont
know
if
id
waste
my
time
with
this
one
again
i
only
drank
this
beer
with
food
i
must
admit
that
it
goes
great
with
food
fine
effort
by
the
dutch
but
it
needs
a
lot
more
effort
to
make
it
to
to
the
top
of
europe
list
i
thought
that
trying
this
ontap
would
alleviate
the
symptoms
of
the
green
bottles
which
are
the
scourge
of
eurolagers
alas
this
beer
is
still
lackluster
with
off
flavors
like
those
prevalent
in
heineken
becks
and
amstel
thicker
than
these
other
huge
european
beers
it
still
contains
their
synthetic
massproduced
waterlike
blandness
it
really
is
almost
identical
to
heineken
if
that
sounds
up
your
alley
you
might
as
well
get
a
skunked
sample
in
one
of
those
semineat
swingtop
bottles
since
it
tastes
like
crap
on
tap
anyway
i
wasnt
even
lucky
enough
to
get
mine
in
a
cool
bottle
but
i
was
lucky
not
to
get
a
skunked
one
typical
lager
attributes
clear
golden
color
with
a
white
head
dry
flavor
with
minimal
hops
standard
capped
green
bottle
not
a
flip
top
clear
golden
body
topped
by
a
frothy
white
head
that
has
surprisingly
good
holding
power
keeping
a
solid
116
throughout
the
glass
and
leaving
some
spotty
lace
the
aroma
is
mainly
of
an
herbal
and
earthy
hop
not
at
all
skunked
thats
reflected
in
the
flavor
along
with
a
dryish
malt
thats
well
balanced
by
bitterness
the
body
is
lightmedium
with
a
very
fine
carbonation
giving
an
exceptionally
smooth
mouthfeel
it
finishes
dry
with
a
gently
lingering
bitterness
hop
flavor
and
maltiness
i
remember
this
being
a
popular
fad
some
years
ago
im
guessing
because
of
the
fliptop
but
its
actually
quite
nice
and
highly
drinkable
although
fairly
basic
still
an
exceptionally
well
done
beer
that
ranks
with
some
of
the
best
german
lagers
a
clear
golden
straw
color
with
a
thin
white
head
half
way
through
the
glass
it
was
completely
gone
the
smell
is
a
bit
skunky
however
it
doesnt
taste
as
bad
as
it
smells
it
goes
down
pretty
good
reminds
me
a
bit
of
heineken
but
tastes
a
little
better
overall
an
average
european
lager
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
large
white
sodalike
head
with
large
bubbles
the
smell
is
the
typical
skunky
but
not
skunked
smell
of
this
beer
that
is
so
overwhelming
it
is
hard
to
smell
anything
else
but
maybe
some
faint
hops
has
a
grassy
twang
type
taste
that
finishes
with
a
dry
bitter
hop
actually
not
bad
has
a
light
to
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
and
the
bitter
finish
leaves
you
wanting
another
swig
proost
having
never
tried
this
beer
i
was
somewhat
impressed
it
has
a
very
clear
amber
color
which
reminds
me
of
ginger
ale
it
pours
with
a
very
nice
head
that
slowly
fades
to
nothing
fairly
fine
bubbles
give
a
lightness
to
the
mouthfeel
this
beer
is
somewhat
sweet
with
hints
of
some
fruit
perhaps
its
apple
i
taste
it
also
has
a
slight
maltiness
as
well
with
a
different
and
interesting
hp
flavor
on
the
finish
overall
im
surprised
by
the
disguised
sweet
flavors
and
impressed
with
this
beer
not
an
everyday
drinking
beer
but
definitely
a
good
change
of
pace
somewhat
lighter
and
sweeter
in
taste
than
i
had
anticipated
aroma
is
marginal
and
is
low
in
carbonation
not
a
brew
for
enjoying
the
big
game
but
works
fine
in
limited
amounts
while
dining
i
did
enjoy
this
offering
i
orginally
bought
this
beer
as
a
teenager
for
the
ceramic
cap
it
made
a
great
roach
clip
since
then
i
have
discovered
1
it
is
just
too
sweet
2
it
has
a
weird
tasting
hops
and
3
most
massed
produced
beers
from
the
netherlands
are
no
better
then
bud
i
usually
have
good
things
to
say
about
most
beer
but
this
does
not
make
it
into
that
category
this
beer
is
very
bland
it
has
a
golden
straw
color
the
aroma
is
also
very
bland
with
that
hollandish
skunkiness
it
does
not
go
down
smooth
and
is
not
very
drinkable
it
was
gross
and
i
only
drank
a
pint
i
do
not
recomend
this
beer
to
anyone
i
am
told
that
this
beer
is
unpasteurized
unlike
heineken
also
the
12oz
format
has
always
tasted
fresher
than
the
17oz
swingtops
ive
sampled
i
give
this
beer
big
appearance
points
mostly
for
the
bottle
gotta
love
the
fliptop
bottle
even
if
it
is
green
the
smell
was
hopped
up
with
very
little
malt
like
most
other
pilsners
and
the
taste
was
more
of
the
same
with
a
higher
malt
content
than
the
smell
not
by
much
average
mouthfeel
but
i
think
it
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
if
you
can
find
it
fresh
i
dont
just
dislike
this
beer
i
am
afraid
of
it
straw
colored
thin
white
head
slightly
sour
off
smell
what
i
expected
actually
taste
was
typical
european
lager
some
sweet
malty
taste
no
real
noticable
hop
note
finish
was
a
bit
sour
and
lingering
a
bit
thin
and
bubbly
not
much
to
note
i
think
its
better
than
a
heineken
and
others
they
seem
to
be
making
a
big
push
in
florida
recently
showing
up
in
every
grocery
store

new

bars
rereviewed
on

2003
all
in
all
i
found
grolsch
premium
lager
to
be
one
of
the
better
green
bottle
beers
that
will
put
the
days
tension
behind
you
if
you
drink
just
a
few
bottles
light
smooth
and
great
for
a
hot
day
under
the
sun
ive
had
both
the
12
0z
bottle
and
the
16
oz
flip
top
and
numbered
review
goes
along
with
the
flip
top
it
is
a
huge
difference
the
flip
top
is
one
of
my
personal
favorites
where
the
12
oz
is
lacking
in
flavor
and
smoothness
it
is
just
not
the
same
seriously
dont
even
bother
with
the
small
bottles
and
go
straight
for
the
delicious
flip
tops
because
they
are
phenomenal
straw
color
with
a
decent
white
head
and
some
lace
funky
smell
fairly
smooth
somewhat
crisp
grassy
herbal
slighty
bitter
taste
light
hoppy
finish
save
the
bottle
for
homebrewing
with
the
locking
swing
cap
i
hadnt
tried
grolsch
in
years
and
recalled
not
being
very
impressed
when
i
saw
a
single
pint
bottle
with
the
swingtop
in
the
store
i
thought
id
give
it
another
try
pours
with
a
dense
white
head
and
a
burnt
golden
color
has
a
spicy
smell
but
seemed
to
be
on
the
borderline
of
being
skunked
somewhat
astringent
mouthfeel
displays
shades
of
sweetness
with
a
crisp
hop
finish
after
the
first
sips
i
really
wasnt
enjoying
the
beer
however
its
qualities
sort
of
grow
on
you
and
by
the
end
of
the
bottle
i
admit
that
it
was
better
than
i
expected
light
bodied
mildly
herbal
slightly
spicey
hop
character
a
summertime
favorite
okay
like
most
people
the
neat
bottle
is
appealing
had
a
decent
color
to
it
the
flavor
was
alright
but
i
have
had
better
its
probably
worth
a
try
but
there
are
better
ones
of
this
style
out
there
pretty
much
what
i
expected
a
respectable
lager
seemed
overly
carbonated
didnt
hold
a
head
slightly
drier
than
i
expected
but
good
oddly
reminded
me
of
hay
while
i
was
drinking
it
i
sampled
this
in
the
nifty
little
flip
top
bottles
the
make
good
containes
for
your
favorite
salad
dressing
when
emptied
of
beer
crisp
tasting
and
definately
made
from
quality
ingredients
slightly
more
malty
than
hoppy
though
dry
in
character
goes
down
fairly
easily
grolsch
i
had
it
in
the
12
ounce
not
the
halfliter
flip
top
slight
skunk
aroma
typical
to
euro
lagers
golden
yellow
with
thin
white
head
nice
balance
of
sweet
malt
and
hops
in
the
follow
throughaftertaste
heads
and
heels
above
henie
nice
golden
color
an
ok
but
bigbubbled
head
smells
very
much
like
fresh
cut
hay
masking
a
slight
skunkiness
hop
taste
dominates
crisp
but
pretty
unidimensional
the
smell
enhances
the
flavor
somewhat
a
little
overcarbed
to
me
drinkable
midpack
brew
and
the
swing
tops
are
great
for
homebrewers
yep
it
stinks
but
i
drink
it
for
the
taste
and
its
not
as
bad
as
it
smells
theres
just
something
about
beer
in
a
green
bottle
i
like
to
taste
better
than
heineken
but
still
quite
skunky
and
a
bitn
thin
pretty
standard
and
boring
beer
in
the
end
though
notes
not
as
coarse
as
other
lagers
from
holland
that
come
to
the
us
all
of
the
herbal
and
grainy
flavours
still
make
it
somewhat
of
a
chore
to
drink
pair
it
with
some
grilled
turkey
sausage
and
kraut
clear
golden
color
that
poured
a
thin
wispy
head
aroma
of
sweet
malted
barley
and
soft
euro
hops
just
a
kiss
of
the
skunkiness
but
thats
ok
since
the
hops
are
supposed
to
add
that
aroma
taste
is
sweet
and
flavorful
with
an
actual
soft
hop
bitterness
that
i
found
agreeable
a
bite
of
alcohol
and
dry
in
the
finish
with
a
hop
aftertaste
lingering
on
the
tongue
yummy
dutch
euro
lager
straw
colored
with
a
good
white
head
also
gives
off
a
nice
sheet
of
lace
the
aroma
is
the
only
draw
back
for
grolsch
nothing
really
great
it
has
this
sort
of
easiness
to
it
and
a
zesty
spiciness
to
it
which
i
enjoyed
i
had
this
at
bennigans
tonight
overall
i
thought
that
it
was
a
above
average
lager
i
believe
this
brew
makes
for
a
excellent
session
brew
also
goes
pretty
well
w
steak
i
know
the
swingtop
stopper
is
a
marketing
gimmick
but
at
least
you
dont
have
to
look
for
your
bottle
opener
having
not
had
one
for
quite
some
time
i
had
one
the
other
day
it
was
better
than
i
had
remembered
golden
color
nice
tast
easy
to
sit
and
drink
i
am
glad
i
went
back
enjoy
this
is
either
new
to
the
market
here
or
so
poorly
distributed
as
to
be
irrelevant
and
overlookable
its
an
interesting
euro
lager
though
quite
frothy
in
creamy
in
both
look
and
feel
and
has
a
nice
wheat
sheaf
sort
of
body
to
it
different
in
its
grain
base
for
sure
bigger
not
adjuncty
at
all
to
me
its
a
little
sweet
throughout
but
its
nicely
carbonated
and
the
finish
is
pretty
quick
so
i
dont
mind
that
its
just
a
lot
more
beer
than
some
of
its
peers
and
i
definitely
can
get
behind
that
its
sort
of
a
cream
ale
meets
a
lager
in
a
lot
of
ways
pretty
boldly
flavored
but
fresh
not
macro
tasting
not
tinny
not
oxidized
or
anything
and
its
actually
a
pretty
passable
beer
for
something
i
have
never
even
heard
of
i
could
drink
a
ton
of
this
mindless
beer
and
you
sometimes
need
that
good
for
sporting
events
and
the
like
dont
think
about
it
just
drink
it
kind
of
stuff
one
of
the
better
of
those
types
i
have
encountered
in
awhile
maybe
this
will
do
well
here
the
creaminess
makes
it
kind
of
boring
not
unpleasant
o
a
little
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
decent
representation
of
style
considering
the
style
this
beer
is
pretty
solid
but
overall
its
mediocre
at
best
o
had
this
last
about
5
years
ago
in
the
uk
that
was
the
velvet
lager
nitro
draft
offering
this
isnt
all
that
bad
its
serviceable
thankfully
has
some
malt
flavor
to
provide
a
modicum
of
interest
overall
a
good
thirst
quencher
but
thats
about
it
decent
flavor
but
nothing
really
special
final
thoughts
all
in
all
its
a
lager
whose
defining
characteristic
is
the
peaty
taste
to
it
im
not
sure
if
that
is
what
you
are
looking
for
in
your
lager
but
for
me
it
was
a
good
one
off
but
thats
about
it
for
as
many
of
these
beers
are
out
there
are
there
really
that
many
people
that
love
this
style
of
beer
compared
to
such
beers
as
ipa
oktoberfest
porter
stout
red
barley
wine
etc
really
puzzles
me
o
sessionable
but
not
overwhelming
a
standard
in
scotland
but
i
much
prefer
innis
and
gunn
better
than
most
of
the
canned
euro
lagers
readily
available
but
nothing
really
stands
out
not
sure
what
i
was
expecting
but
with
it
being
scottish
i
expected
something
a
bit
more
robust
than
this
overall
considering
how
cheap
this
beer
is
it
isnt
that
bad
its
good
value
if
your
having
a
good
old
fashioned
drinking
session
down
the
pub
nothing
offensive
to
the
senses
though
nothing
all
that
interesting
either
i
imagine
this
as
an
acceptable
stadium
beer
one
that
wont
make
you
wish
you
were
somewhere
else
just
for
the
beer
overall
i
expected
more
from
this
one
all
i
got
was
just
another
boring
euro
beer
its
not
offensive
and
it
is
very
drinkable
its
just
plain
and
unremarkable
there
are
too
many
better
options
available
out
there
i
wouldnt
buy
this
one
again
pale
yellow
colour
just
over
one
finger
of
white
head
lots
of
lace
on
the
glass
smell
is
lightly
grassy
and
floral
but
everything
else
suggests
malt
sandwich
grainy
with
some
graham
cracker
as
well
some
earthy
hops
as
well
taste
is
fruity
and
malty
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
light
lingering
bitterness
in
the
finish
biscuity
and
grainy
aftertaste
but
slightly
bland
medium
to
high
carbonation
lightmed
body
ok
feel
this
is
a
little
better
than
some
examples
of
style
but
nothing
impressive
here
to
say
the
least
overall
not
bad
for
a
pale
lager
this
is
very
traditional
euro
lager
but
taste
and
aroma
docent
seem
to
have
the
heinbecks
smell
or
taste
it
certainly
got
more
to
it
than
the
others
o
standard
pub
beer
good
for
a
couple
nice
change
form
all
of
bitter
i
have
consumed
on
this
trip
tennents
was
ok
the
pour
reminded
me
of
something
similar
to
a
miller
lite
the
head
was
basically
no
where
in
sight
the
aroma
was
grainy
and
had
a
little
something
else
in
there
im
not
quite
sure
of
the
taste
was
kind
of
on
the
sweet
side
not
really
the
best
mouthfeel
here
this
beer
was
nearly
water
when
it
comes
to
that
the
beer
isnt
the
best
scottish
beer
out
there
it
was
nice
to
try
but
ive
never
thought
about
going
back
for
more
pretty
poor
lager
that
i
try
to
and
frequently
fail
to
avoid
d
not
very
good
but
not
bad
its
on
the
right
side
of
undrinkability
still
not
recommended
golden
yellow
in
color
with
a
decent
white
head
that
dissipated
pretty
quickly
no
head
retention
or
lacings
light
malty
aroma
with
hints
of
biscuit
and
a
light
floral
fruity
hop
character
medium
bodied
a
bit
of
a
buttery
feel
with
refershing
carbonation
sweet
malty
flavor
with
hints
of
breadbiscuit
and
a
fruity
apple
and
pear
hop
finish
very
easy
to
drink
notes
interesting
story
about
how
i
came
about
trying
this
and
it
hit
the
spot
as
a
really
needed
an
easy
to
drink
beer
or
any
beer
all
together
this
is
an
easy
to
drink
lager
nothing
that
will
blow
you
away
but
it
isnt
a
horrible
euro
pale
lager
decent
enough
lager
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
easy
to
put
down
i
poured
this
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
45
degrees
the
beer
was
a
pretty
blond
with
a
nice
big
white
fluffy
head
the
smell
smelled
like
a
skunk
which
i
knew
because
for
some
reason
that
is
what
beer
in
a
green
bottle
smells
like
green
taste
also
kinda
sweet
tasting
i
will
not
buy
this
beer
again
poured
from
a
green

2
oz
bottle
has
a
pale
golden
color
with
a
12
inch

smell
is
skunky
taste
is
good
malts
and
grains
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
is
highly
drinkable
overall
a
pretty
good
quality
beer
drinkability
if
one
were
to
excuse
the
ghastly
skunkiness
its
really
not
such
a
bad
lager
and
according
to
the
label
is
even
scotlands
finest
lager
as
i
cant
name
another
scottish
lager
i
cant
readily
argue
with
that
statement
scotlands
finest
lager
was
looking
for
an
alternative
to
heineken
but
this
is
not
it
its
appearance
is
impressive
a
sparkling
gold
with
a
foamy
inch
whitish
head
but
the
smell
is
skunky
just
like
heineken
and
the
taste
is
even
skunkier
than
heinekent
dry
malty
with
a
little
bit
of
sweetness
makes
the
drinkability
ok
but
just
not
a
great
beer
im
a
little
surprised
with
how
much
i
like
this
its
a
nice
workman
like
lager
some
spicy
hop
notes
on
the
aroma
but
a
clean
sweet
maltiness
on
the
flavor
biscuity
and
toasty
maltiness
very
refreshing
and
crisp
big
problem
is
the
skunky
notes
from
the
green
bottle
but
i
bet
this
is
pretty
good
fresh
on
tap
taste
a
little
surprise
mildly
pleasant
even
if
it
tastes
like
the
malt
backbone
was
lightened
by
some
adjunct
like
corn
or
even
rice
minimal
but
effectual
hop
presence
prickly
mouthfeel
not
a
lot
but
enough
and
remains
drinkable
a
good
hot
weather
session
beer
d
all
in
all
a
pretty
sessional
brew
ill
keep
an
eye
out
for
this
one

it

and
being

as
much
as
i
love

this
is
a
wide
pass
for
me
overall
definitely
not
something
i
will
be
revisiting
soon
if
i
did
have
a
choice
between
this
or
other
bmc
products
i
would
choose
this
one
d
a
classic
euro
pale
session
lager
in
the
uk
regarded
onpar
with
carlsberg
and
harp
but
without
as
good
of
a
reputation
not
bad
for
what
it
is
but
ultimately
just
a
cheaper
version
of
the
european
bud
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
sweet
and
mildly
citrusy
in
the
finish
i
would
try
this
again
but
only
if
it
was
either
free
or
ontap
preferrably
in
scotland
so
many
of
these
beers
taste
like
flat
keg
beer
but
this
holds
up
better
nothing
special
no
lacing
appearance
is
average
to
good
no
hops
not
too
bitter
sessionable
not
bad
but
no
need
to
search
it
out
at
5

its
very
sessionable
and
one

could
certainly
have

probably

had
a
few
more
but
there
was
more
of
glasgow
to
see
and
more
pubs
to
hit
overall
a
good
beer
and
one
i
would
order
again
when
the
tennents
showed
up
at
the
party
i
felt
good
until
typically
the
scotch
ale
that
tennents
makes
is
a
good
beer
this
what
i
expected
as
soon
as
i

a
taste
and
experience
wait
a
bit
and
some
overpaid
marketing
hack
will
actually
pitch
this
im
sure
then
oranjeboom
is
replete
with
it
keep
your
money
in
your
pocket
and
buy
something
else
this
lager
is
reminiscent
of
all
of
those
cheap
watery
lagers
we
used
to
have
to
buy
as
teenagers
because
we
didnt
have
the
funds
to
buy
anything
else
its
so
light
and
tasteless
that
it
can
barely
be
considered
worthy
of
even
being
on
these
forums
its
barely
a
beer
its
weak
and
doesnt
even
lead
to
anything
of
a
buzz
so
whats
the
point
in
it
easy
drinking
beer
clean
with
a
cracker
grain
backbone
and
light
floral
hops
the
mineral
character
is
unique
and
somewhat
mouthwatering
o
this
is
so
damn
dull
its
unbelievable
its
not
even
dull
in
the
right
way
instead
of
drinking
like
carbonated
water
its
like
drinking
carbonated
water
thats
obstructively
sweet
itll
get
finished
unlike
two
others
i
drank
earlier
im
now
officially
sick
of
macro
lagers
for
a
few
days
i
need
a
proper
ipa
right
about
now
a
six
pack
of
tallboy
cans
goes
for
5
99
at
the
local
trader
joes
brewed
according
to
german
purity
laws
oranjeboom
is
a
good
value
for
an
all
malt
lager
it
is
enjoyable
when
camping
fishing
or
out
in
the
hot
sun
good
if
you
want
to
throw
back
a
few
while
watching
the
game
orangeboom
is
malty
and
dry
it
is
an
economy
version
of
the
euro
lager
but
its
pretty
damn
good
for
the
price
this
beer
is
a
cheap
inoffensive
but
otherwise
unnoteworthy
beer
i
cant
conceive
why
i
would
be
drawn
to
try
it
again
overall
oranjeboom
is
a
decent
macrostyle
lager
that
id
drink
again
if
in
the
mood
for
the
style
its
certainly
much
better
than
most
of
the
macros
produced
on
this
side
of
the
atlantic
the
verdict
not
bad
fairly
well
balanced
and
goes
down
smooth
almost
too
smooth
nothing
outstanding
about
it
but
nothing
to
complain
about
either
rjt
overall
drinkability
not
bad
but
nothing
special
good
drinkability
though
washed
down
chicken
and
caprice
salad
easily
without
getting
in
the
way
i
think
thats
what
makes
this
beer
its
an
average
beer
versatile
with
food
but
nothing
special
a
staple
beer
to
have
with
food
if
youre
not
looking
for
something
interesting
pilsner
appearance
light
carbonation
the
smell
is
more
complex
than
other
cheap
beers
that
ive
had
this
one
has
a
cereal
nose
with
a
hint
of
you
never
would
have
guessed
it
orange
the
taste
is
nothing
special
just
crispness
in
a
can
and
you
can
certainly
drink
many
of
these
guys
id
say
this
is
a
great
summer
beer
overall
im
impressed
for
the
price
this
shows
that
the
europeans
make
great
cheap
beer
where
america
makes
shitty
cheap
beer
go
craft
in
america
go
cheap
in
europe
thats
my
slogan
light
corn
yellow
fizzy
head
that
fades
to
a
dusting
of
sud
smell
is
light
and
corny
taste
crisp
and
biting
but
with
a
horrid
metallic
aftertaste
some
faint
citrus
melon
cinnamon
putrid
kinda
mouthfeel
and
aftertaste
light
pilsner
with
a
refreshing
sensation
for
a
hot
day
not
a
bad
tasting
beer
just
not
enough
taste
within
the
thin
walls
of
this
glass
of
beer
the
body
was
good
smooth
even
clean
and
well
balanced
drinkability
was
very
good
the
beer
went
down
quickly
and
easily
after
a
2
hour
bike
ride
overall
an
above
average
example
of
the
style
worth
grabbing
a
can
if
you
see
it
and
are
in
the
mood
for
light
smooth
easy
drinking
beer
o
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
but
doesnt
have
any
interesting
aromas
or
flavors
o
this
beer
is
not
bad
but
it
not
anything
special
either
easy
to
drink
and
sessionable
but
not
sure
that
i
would
really
want
to
have
more
than
one
of
these
at
a
time
i
wish
this
had
a
little
more
hop
presence
not
a
ton
but
just
a
hint
more
just
about
even
with
your
typical
american
macro
in
a
nutshell
i
wont
be
buying
any
more
of
this
brand
overall
3
out
of
5
an
average
eurolager
not
bad
at
all
just
nothing
exceptional
im
thinking
pork
sausages
and
potatoes
with
this
one
o
an
average
euro
lager
easy
drinking
nothing
special
o
a
strictly
mediocre
beer
still
better
than
the
american
adjuncts
there
is
nothing
special
about
this
lager
it
is
clean
yet
lacks
any
kind
of
flavor
o
not
too
bad
for
a
macro
pale
lager
head
and
shoulders
above
most
i
bought
a
six
pack
of
cans
from
trader
joes
for
dirt
cheap
not
nearly
as
bad
as
some
of
the
other
reviews
have
given
can
popped
with
no
fizz
but
it
poured
a
2
offwhite
head
with
medium
lifespan
its
a
clear
straw
yellow
color
smells
like
grass
and
grain
the
taste
is
mild
with
malt
and
a
very
tiny
bitter
aftertaste
of
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
creamier
than
most
american
bmcs
but
otherwise
theyre
equivalent
o
overall
an
okay
beer
there
are
better
examples
of
this
style
out
there
but
this
one
is
cheap
and
makes
a
decent
lawnmowerhot
day
kinda
beer
cant
really
complain
here
for
the
cost
a
tang
rather
than
a
taste
of
hops
not
even
worth
the
price
at
trader
joes
where
it
has
been
a
cheap
euro
lager
staple
for
years
the
simpler
times
wisconsin
beers
are
even
cheaper
but
so
much
better
500
ml
can
from
traders
joe
pours
golden
with
a
thick
long
lasting
white
head
and
lively
carbonation
aroma
is
of
grass
grain
and
dough
body
is
light
and
smooth
taste
is
a
little
bit
of
hops
a
little
bit
of
biscuit
malt
and
a
lot
of
sourness
the
can
was
probably
old
but
still
i
dont
think
i
will
buy
this
beer
again
overall
its
better
then
a
miller
or
bud
but
not
worth
buying
its
low
alcohol
easy
to
drink
feel
would
appeal
to
the
classic
american
macro
beer
drinker
or
someone
that
likes
imported
beers
like
becks
or
heiniken
not
for
me
cant
recommend
it
poured
this
16
oz
can
into
a
pint
glass
this
euro
pale
lager
poured
a
clear
golden
color
produced
a
average
white
head
and
featured
poor
head
retention
it
provided
a
small
amount
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
of
this
lager
smelled
of
cooked
vegetables
malt
and
a
touch
of
hops
light
in
body
this
lagger
is
thin
and
it
features
a
earthy
grain
flavor
there
is
a
suggestion
of
citrus
and
it
has
a
dry
finish
overall
there
is
not
much
flavor
or
much
of
anything
to
be
excited
about
i
will
avoid
this
one
in
the
future
prost
overall
a
very
drinkable
pale
lager
this
is
one
of
my
choice
tailgating
beers
pours
a
brilliant
clear
golden
color
with
a
bright
white
colored
head
ive
never
seen
this
beer
in
the
states
country
of
origin
is
definitely
holland
but
this
stuff
is
brewed
by
hofbrauhaus
in
braunschweig
germany
16
ounces
in
a
six
pack
of
cans
for
7
99
you
really
cant
beat
that
price
but
how
does
the
actual
beer
match
up
to
the
price
the
symbol
is
the
royal
orange
tree
with
a
crown
over
it
can
alone
is
very
nice
with
blue
silver
and
orange
color
pattern
literally
made
me
want
to
buy
this
beer
and
believe
that
it
was
something
special
aromatics
dont
impress
me
much
more
of
a
muted
cooked
vegetable
corn
syrup
fermented
out
although
brewed
in
germany
i
dont
think
this
was
brewed
with
just
malts
hops
barley
and
water
as
i
take
a
few
more
sniffs
there
is
something
pleasant
about
the
overall
smell
im
getting
that
makes
it
bearable
flavor
has
an
assertive
grainy
flow
that
has
metallic
edges
and
moderate
sweetness
suggestive
of
cornmalts
with
mild
light
herbal
muddled
hop
grassiness
mouthfeel
is
pretty
carbonated
lighter
bodied
mass
produced
industrial
lager
from
europe
this
beer
has
a
history
of
an
original
site
in
holland
that
has
been
bought
out
by
interbrew
now
inbev
and
is
just
now
part
of
a
portfolio
of
similar
beers
that
will
sell
well
to
the
masses
overall
a
slightly
above
average
euro
lager
with
some
redeeming
qualities
in
between
some
rather
harsh
moments
in
each
sip
overall
this
is
an
average
example
of
the
style
it
does
nothing
to
separate
itself
from
the
rest
of
the
pack
but
is
by
no
means
not
drinkable
this
beer
has
its
place
a
nice
sunny
day
working
in
the
yard
or
at
a
ballgame
overall
a
lackluster
lager
the
huskiness
here
is
unpleasant
so
keep
it
cold
and
throw
it
back
fast
if
you
must
overall
meh
this
isnt
good
it
isnt
terrible
but
it
is
so
bland
and
boring
that
if
it
some
how
became
a
vapor
birds
would
fall
from
the
sky
dead
of
boredom

the

quite
light

a
pretty
standard
beer
nothing
to
rave
for
or
against
golden

not
super
high
carbonation
not
really
very
fragrant
but
beer
is
the
common

this

worth
having
in

for
a
cold
one

not

off

yes
in
a

sort
of
trashy
euro
lager
way
drink
it
ice
cold
and
straight
out
the
can
and
it
is
not
bad
a
buck
a
can
at
tjs
make
it
decent
value
better
imho
than
a
bud
or
coorlight
with
the
fact
you
can
taste
and

it
is
not
up
to
the

this
is
a
pretty

beer
nothing

good
but
nothing
too
bad
on
the
cheap
at
trader
joes
o
a
refreshing
beer
cold
for
a
hot
summer
day
but
not
a
standout
still
a
beer
and
capable
of
being
enjoyed
more
enjoyable
than
the
typical
mainstream
domestic
lager
it
does
have
actual
hop
flavor
that
avoids
both
skunkiness
and
any
real
bitterness
not
a
bad
session
beer
for
6
a
6pk
of
pint
cans
the
body
is
a
very
pale
brass
colored
body
the
off
white
head
and
lace
are
excellent
both
have
a
lot
of
creamy
staying
power
the
smell
is
mild
the
taste
is
also
very
mild
it
hard
to
really
get
a
sense
of
anything
it
is
light
and
thin
with
mainly
cereal
esters
with
some
yeast
spice
while
it
is
just
another
runofthemill
lager
from
europe
at
least
oranjeboom
is
cheap
when
you
get
it
at
trader
joes
i
cant
complain
too
much
about
a
1
pint
can
i
picked
up
a
few
tall
boy
cans
at
trader
joes
last
week
and
just
cracked
a
cold
one
to
have
after
a
day
in
the
sun
not
bad
at
allsimple
crisp
refreshing
lager
reminds
me
of
a
lighter
version
of
grolsch
some
nice
light
hops
and
malt
a
touch
of
the
euro
lager
skunkiness
too
overall
an
enjoyable
brew
and
certainly
better
than
most
cheap
american
brews
overall
this
is
an
okay
lager
better
than
bmcs
d
refreshing
though
nothing
special
to
taste
respectable
read
more
expensive
alternative
to
budweiser
i
picked
up
a
six
pack
at
trader
joes
which
seems
to
carry
nothing
but
sierra
nevada
and
douche
beer
wasnt
really
in
the
mood
for
sierra
nevada
so
i
grabbed
this
one
hypothesis
confirmed
beer
was
less
agreeable
the
more
it
warmed
one
of
the
few
id
say
drink
cold
and
enjoy
the
skunk
on
it
if
your
into
trying
new
beers
like
i
do
go
get
yourself
one
and
check
it
off
on
your
list
of
conquered
beers
otherwise
any
standard
american
bmc
will
do
just
as
well
food
match
boring
food
steamed
vegetables
and
plain
white
rice
the
hint
of
honey
i
found
might
make
it
go
well
with
dessert
but
who
drinks
beer
with
desserts
dr
affordable
by
irish
standards
but
nowhere
near
a
great
beer
o
very
crisp
and
light
brew
just
really
nothing
going
on
here
a
very
average
beer
certainly
not
what
qualifies
as
premium
in
my
book
flavourwise
its
bland
and
uninteresting
might
be
refreshing
in
hot
weather
although
i
can
think
of
better
things
to
drink
pass
pretty
good
beer
this
beer
reminded
me
a
lot
of
a
grolsh
or
heineken
its
got
that
traditional
lager
flavor
to
it
where
its
a
little
bitter
and
aged
the
color
is
plae
yellow
and
not
overly
exciting
just
about
another
european
lager
i
dont
see
myself
really
trying
to
find
this
one
again
any
time
soon
d
overall
this
is
a
very
light
and
refreshing
lager
that
is
both
easy
to
drink
and
easy
to
stomach
very
sessionable
but
not
overly
palatable
at
6
for
a
sixpack
this
is
an
absolute
steal
d
not
a
hard
one
to
drink
for
sure
this
was
an
average
brew
but
still
worth
a
try
and
kind
of
fun
to
have
at
new
years
since
its
not
super
popular
here
in
central
pa
sometimes
youve
gotta
wonder
at
the
random
beer
you
can
find
for
real
cheap
at
trader
joes
this
one
pours
a
clear
pale
straw
topped
by
a
finger
of
white
froth
the
nose
comprises
wheat
corn
dust
and
hard
water
the
taste
holds
notes
of
wheat
light
orange
peel
flowers
light
greens
and
corn
syrup
the
body
is
quite
light
with
a
light
carbonation
and
a
watery
feel
overall
a
pretty
standard
beer
nothing
to
rave
for
or
against
would
be
easy
to
session
8
for
a
sixer
isnt
a
bad
price
either
another
euro
lager
that
trumps
your
typical
american
rice
and
corn
beer
would
drink
again
drinkability
is
good
this
would
actually
be
tasty
in
the
summer
months
as
its
light
and
you
can
definately
put
a
few
away
id
say
the
cloying
kicks
in
about
round
4
it
is
what
it
is
and
i
would
take
it
over
a
bmc
or
at
least
a
bmc
light
picked
up
a
single
can
for
1
at
trader
joes
to
try
since
i
always
see
this
beer
here
poured
into
a
tall
pilsener
glass
bright
yellow
color
foamy
white
head
with
some
lacing
and
decent
carbonation
smelled
like
an
average
euro
lager
taste
was
better
than
i
expected
there
was
a
bit
of
malt
with
some
corn
flavor
but
there
were
no
real
offending
flavors
to
turn
me
off
at
all
mouthfeel
was
crisp
enough
to
please
me
drinkability
was
fairly
good
as
this
beer
was
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
for
a
dollar
i
wasnt
expecting
much
but
it
wasnt
too
bad
i
would
drink
a
can
of
this
beer
again
if
the
price
was
right
poured
from
an
extra
tall
can
pours
a
glowing
gold
with
a
shortlived
fizzy
white
head
aromas
similar
to
those
of
the
selfproclaimed
king
of
beers
fail
to
impress
fortunately
the
taste
is
nothing
like
the
kobs
but
its
still
falls
short
of
being
interesting
faint
grains
and
a
light
sugary
sweetness
dominate
the
profile
which
finishes
long
and
honeylike
watery
body
is
unappealing
sadly
i
bought
a
sixpack
my
pour
created
an
impressive
two
fingers
of
bonewhite
head
with
excellent
retention
especially
in
the
face
of
the
broiler
oven
that
is
today
nothing
like
high
heat
and
humidity
to
make
me
want
to
crack
open
a
can
of
beer
color
was
a
deep
goldenyellow
with
nequality
clarity
nose
had
the
characteristic
maltylagersweetness
that
lagers
are
supposed
to
have
not
the
weak
diluted
smell
of
aals
sure
my
sixer
was
a
little
more
expensive
than
a
rack
of
miller
but
that
is
the
tradeoff
for
not
using
adjuncts
you
cant
have
it
every
which
way
but
loose
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
a
pleasant
lager
sweetness
in
the
mouth
finish
had
a
faint
taste
of
honey
another
characteristic
of
unadulterated
lagers
this
was
a
nice
pleasant
lager
and
one
that
i
would
put
in
my
cooler
its
not
going
to
knock
your
socks
off
but
it
wont
require
choking
it
down
either
hear
me
minhas
pours
a
clean
pale
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
in
the
aroma
a
dry
sugary
almost
orangeish
like
lager
smell
in
the
taste
kind
of
a
standard
euro
pale
lager
with
a
small
orange
hint
a
smooth
and
light
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
semi
dry
small
orange
like
aftertaste
standard
lager
but
hints
of
orange
are
different
update
the
5
version
is
mostly
the
same
notes
only
sharper
ironically
making
a
less
drinkable
beer
still
ahead
of
most
other
cheap
lager
in
a
can
though
d
easy
drinking
for
sure
though
another
countrys
basic
lager
so
yes
it
is
drinkable
but
would
i
buy
it
again
no
overall
might
be
an
ok
beer
without
the
metal
an
acceptable
beer
but
pretty
underwhelming
for
something
with
the
word
boom
on
the
can
this
one
is
cheap
if
you
need
a
cheap
beer
it
works
d
this
was
worth
a
try
once
but
i
dont
think
id
want
the
imported
version
we
get
in
the
u
s
again
im
sure
it
is
much
better
closer
to
the
source
d
crisp
and
light
no
real
distinct
flavors
weak
and
slightly
watery
probably
wont
be
a
go
to
lawnmower
beer
ever
cheap
is
what
this
beer
has
going
for
it
better
than
your
typical
pale
lager
but
not
much
to
get
excited
about
good
alternative
to
more
expensive
euro
lagers
d
a
good
european
lager
this
beer
struck
me
as
a
good
alternative
to
heineken
with
a
similar
flavor
profile
for
a
cheaper
pricepurchased
a
6
pack
of
16oz
cans
for
5
99
the
color
is
nothing
too
spectacular
with
a
light
goldish
color
and
a
decent
frothy
head
smell
was
of
grass
and
dirt
with
a
hint
of
malt
sweetness
in
the
background
flavor
was
on
par
with
other
euro
lagers
such
as
lowenbrau
and
heineken
sweet
malt
and
earthy
flavors
up
front
with
a
bit
of
a
dry
finish
but
this
is
by
far
the
driest
beer
i
have
had
in
awhile
maybe
just
a
bit
too
dry
anyhow
this
is
a
decent
and
cheaper
alternative
to
more
pricey
euro
lagers
and
tastes
like
it
will
do
the
trick
on
a
hot
summer
day
give
it
a
shot
the
mouth
is
smooth
but
no
more
than
slightly
above
average
i
suppose
its
an
easy
enough
beer
to
drink
but
there
is
not
much
to
recommended
and
not
much
to
disparage
with
this
one
beer
is
a
golden
yellow
with
a
good
head
some
of
which
was
knocked
off
by
the
bartender
it
has
a
sort
of
grainy
smell
the
taste
fairly
crisp
refreshing
much
smoother
than
i
expected
beer
is
good
for
more
than
one
not
a
bad
euro
beer
one
pint
while
easy
to
finish
satiates
my
desire
for
this
beer
in
the
mid
1970s
it
was
my
prefered
dutch
beer
on
tap
i
lived
on
the
dutchgerman
border
i
dont
remember
it
being
so
bland
then
i
think
it
has
changed
a
great
deal
since
those
days
not
quite
the
sum
of
its
parts
eric
d
pretty
easy
to
drink
but
nothing
i
will
seek
out
again
better
than
the
the
3
horses
from
the
same
company
i
had
earlier
tonight
but
neither
one
are
anything
special
the
can
must
be
the
way
to
go
the
beer
is
a
simple
lager
really
cheap
and
from
a
can
no
skunk
the
beer
has
biscuity
malts
almost
no
hops
is
slightly
sweet
not
much
bitterness
to
counteract
the
sweetness
but
the
flavor
is
minimal
anyway
probably
a
great
summer
beer
golden
amber
small
head
fades
to
nothing
aroma
is
mostly
honey
and
some
nice
biscuity
malt
but
also
a
little
skunk
in
the
background
more
honey
and
sweet
malt
on
taste
very
gentle
shortlived
bitterness
very
watery
and
too
much
carbonation
too
sweet
and
not
enough
hops
but
otherwise
pretty
good
for
a
macro
lager
poured
from
a
16
oz
can
has
a
pale
yellow
color
with
a
1
inch
head
smells
of
malts
some
sweetness
taste
is
very
mild
slightly
bitter
not
a
whole
lot
of
flavor
here
feels
good
in
the
mouth
and
has
decent
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
mediocre
beer
pours
out
a
clear
yellow
color
with
a
medium
white
head
the
aroma
is
light
malts
some
skunked
notes
and
grassy
aromas
a
sweet
grassy
and
malty
flavor
light
hops
a
crisp
and
clean
pale
lager
a
decent
choice
though
id
rather
have
a
local
version
picked
up
a
single
from
liberty
st
tavern
oh
man
this
is
skunk
city
usa
even
after
letting
it
air
out
for
a
few
minutes
which
is
all
a
lot
of
skunked
beers
need
but
it
was
to
no
avail
beyond
the
stank
this
beer
basically
tastes
like
heineken
theres
a
yeastdriven
fruity
sweetness
though
the
beer
isnt
very
sweet
along
with
a
very
pale
grain
taste
id
honestly
need
to
drink
them
sidebyside
to
tell
them
apart
this
one
might
have
a
little
more
flavor
but
the
skunk
makes
it
hard
to
tell
freaking
green
bottles
d
this
is
nothing
more
than
another
massproduced
euro
lager
no
real
personality
or
taste
to
speak
of
drinkability
not
nearly
the
hop
profile
i
would
expect
from
even
a
europale
lager
lack
of
carbonation
makes
the
beer
too
syrupy
and
cloying
oranjeboom
pours
a
transparent
orange
slightly
brown
color
with
a
2
finger
white
head
and
some
sticking
classic
marco
lager
nose
hmm
nothing
amazing
here
in
taste
either
macro
cheapo
malts
weak
hop
character
and
an
overall
skunky
funky
taste
gotta
love
those
green
bottles
this
beer
is
no
stand
out
and
is
much
better
on
draught
in
amsterdam
it
sports
a
light
body
and
is
extremely
drinkable
if
you
like
this
kind
of
stuff
pouring
from
a
one
pint
can
you
see
a
decent
golden
color
but
a
minimal
head
that
quickly
fades
to
nothing
with
zero
lacing
the
smell
isnt
bad
but
not
very
pilsner
like
just
a
plain
ol
dutch
lager
the
taste
is
mild
in
its
maltiness
and
with
modest
bittering
and
floral
notes
from
the
hops
there
is
some
of
that
traditional
hop
smell
found
in
pilsners
and
dutch
lagers
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
light
with
balancing
carbonation
if
youre
hot
and
not
in
the
mood
for
something
heavy
or
serious
this
is
not
a
bad
place
to
go
for
6
a
sixer
of
pint
cans
pours
a
very
light
crystal
clear
golden
color
with
a
big
lid
of
fine
white
foam
i
got
some
lightly
sweet
lemon
with
lightly
toasted
grainy
malts
and
a
touch
of
grassy
hops
its
got
a
light
body
with
a
loft
of
soft
foamy
carbonation
pretty
basic
stuff
here
i
would
drink
this
beer
again
if
it
was
available
but
would
rather
try
another
beer
if
possible
this
is
pretty
drinkable
and
i
really
like
the
16oz
can
serving
this
is
definitely
a
beer
i
will
get
again
because
of
the
great
price
and
value
compared
to
some
other
macro
beers
doesnt
finish
as
smooth
and
crisp
as
others
but
still
a
decent
beer
nonetheless
poured
from
the
16oz
can
into
a
pint
glass
body
is
a
bright
mellow
golden
color
topped
by
a
small
bright
white
head
sweet
bready
aroma
of
adjunct
malt
and
just
a
hint
of
fruity
hops
palate
is
sweet
corny
adjunct
malt
with
a
mildly
bitter
hoppy
edge
on
the
finish
body
is
a
touch
creamy
but
still
thin
much
like
many
euro
lagers
not
a
bad
option
but
like
many
in
its
class
should
probably
be
avoided
still
not
particularly
offensive
and
i
could
drink
a
couple
of
these
if
given
inferior
options
drinkability
soso
at
best
typical
euro
macro
flavor
that
is
boring
but
you
can
drink
in
a
pinch
brisk
taste
with
some
noble
hops
commanding
the
flow
this
is
crisp
and
pretty
drinkable
aftertaste
has
a
tinge
of
metal
which
is
a
negative
overall
this
is
a
good
cheap
sixer
for
when
people
are
coming
over
for
the
game
but
not
really
something
to
look
for
when
you
want
to
drink
one
quality
brew
16
oz
can
1
at
trader
joes
im
not
one
to
complain
about
decent
beer
at
a
value
price
by
no
means
is
this
a
top
tier
beer
but
it
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
has
no
real
offensive
qualities
conversely
there
is
no
semblance
of
a
chance
being
taken
here
either
there
are
no
strong
flavors
or
aromas
the
appearance
is
normal
a
totally
average
beer
and
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
that
in
my
estimation
recommended
16
ounce
can
bought
from
andersons
for
1
15
served
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
clear
gold
color
with
about
an
inch
white
head
head
retention
and
lacing
is
low
it
smells
like
sweetbready
malt
grain
and
a
little
bit
of
hops
aroma
isnt
bad
at
all
but
it
is
weak
taste
is
sweet
and
grainy
for
the
style
of
beer
its
not
bad
mouthfeelbody
is
light
its
thin
but
not
watery
has
a
little
above
average
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
its
prety
easy
to
drink
overall
this
beer
is
pretty
average
with
that
being
said
its
ok
to
drink
and
its
not
offensive
id
drink
it
again
d
this
goes
down
like
a
champ
avoid
trust
me
usually
these
brews
are
thin
and
watery
but
a
solid
mix
of
aromas
and
flavors
give
this
brew
a
wonderful
array
of
attributes
that
work
together
on
its
behalf
it
is
light
bodied
but
not
thin
it
is
pale
but
not
weak
a
solid
example
of
a
pale
lager
cheers
mouthfeeldrinkability
light
bodied
carbonation
seems
on
the
light
side
relatively
smooth
though
with
a
watered
down
taste
overall
its
pretty
much
unimpressive
not
recommended
another
selection
from
my
israeli
adventure
purchased
a
fourpack
in
a
sixteen
ounce
size
for
pretty
cheap
and
wasnt
completely
dissapointed
this
beer
got
me
pretty
buzzed
and
for
the
money
i
paid
wasnt
a
bad
experience
a
nice
flavor
which
was
grainy
and
light
compared
to
some
other
styles
i
sampled
over
there
actually
saw
this
brew
again
in
trader
joes
but
passed
it
up
as
it
was
much
more
expensive
in
the
states
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
werent
bad
this
beer
went
down
real
nicely
and
i
could
easily
drink
a
few
of
these
would
recommend
this
beer
being
an
aboveaverage
example
of
the
style
could
drink
many
of
these
because
it
is
light
and
does
not
fill
you
up
too
much
like
some
other
lagers
might
oh
well
i
have
a
few
more
to
take
to
the
pool
on
a
hot
day
thats
about
it
not
much
to
say
about
this
one
overall
just
too
sweet
and
nothing
interesting
going
on
dont
bother
recommended
the
taste
up
front
has
some
decent
hop
character
not
citrusy
maybe
a
touch
of
grass
the
malty
side
moves
in
rather
weakly
about
midway
through
and
it
finishes
fairly
dry
but
kind
of
watery
the
more
sips
i
take
the
less
interesting
it
becomes
nothing
special
here
and
is
really
only
useful
for
the
sake
of
trying
it
and
reviewing
it
ill
be
taking
the
rest
of
these
with
me
when
i
go
to
play
volley
ball
with
my
friends
its
great
for
an
active
summer
day
d
very
drinkable
and
thirst
quenching
on
a
summer
day
in
southern
california
i
got
through
the
16
oz
in
a
matter
of
minutes
and
would
definitely
drink
this
again
great
price
and
a
great
summer
beer
its
beer
very
drinkable
it
reallly
hit
the
sopt
and
went
down
nice
after
a
tough
day
at
work
overall
nothing
that
stands
out
a
cookie
cutter
low
cost
euro
lager
easy
enough
to
drink
however
notes
not
alot
to
say
about
this
as
its
a
run
of
the
mill
beer
with
no
imagination
whatsoever
youll
be
better
off
leaving
this
on
the
shelf
easy
drinkability
level
and
somewhat
quaffable
reminds
me
of
decent
pilsner
a
straightforward
lager
with
crossover
appeal
mouthfeel
was
zesty
with
a
lingering
oiliness
not
one
i
will
seek
again
picked
up
a
six
pack
of
pint
cans
for
6
bucks
at
tjs
pours
a
typical
yellow
darker
than
some
euro
lagers
lighter
than
others
tid
bit
of
head
that
goes
away
quick
aroma
is
of
apple
peal
pears
noble
hops
summer
nights
in
germany
flavor
is
basic
lager
nonoffensive
not
as
crisp
as
it
could
be
decent
amount
of
hop
bitterness
mouthfeel
like
i
said
is
not
as
crisp
as
a
lager
of
this
type
should
be
md
light
bodied
and
highly
carbonated
not
smooth
but
not
harsh
either
a
better
than
decent
euro
lager
more
thin
than
id
like
but
the
carbonation
isnt
bad
and
this
is
really
aimed
at
people
who
drink
swill
anyhow
when
compared
to
others
of
its
ilk
it
stands
up
rather
well
im
not
having
another
but
i
could
see
how
a
certain
demographic
would
find
it
a
step
up
from
their
everyday
offerings
drinkability
not
that
bad
average
is
a
good
descriptor
typical
light
lager
thats
very
drinkable
but
doesnt
really
have
any
stand
out
features
there
isnt
really
a
distinct
aroma
smells
a
bit
like
corngrains
mouthfeel
is
very
good
light
with
just
enough
carbonation
taste
could
be
improved
if
turned
up
just
a
little
bit
its
hoppy
flavor
and
bitter
aftertaste
is
pretty
good
i
just
wanted
more
of
it
an
ok
beer
but
nothing
special
this
one
doesnt
try
to
hard
to
impress
pours
a
nice
golden
color
with
lots
of
white
chunky
head
that
eventually
fades
but
leaves
lace
all
over
the
glass
smells
mostly
light
struck
theres
a
faint
hop
aroma
but
too
faint
to
really
pick
it
tastes
very
clean
slight
bitterness
leaves
a
sort
of
coppery
aftertaste
not
sure
where
that
came
from
but
mostly
its
just
a
clean
flavor
mouthfeel
is
like
slightly
heavier
water
all
in
all
its
very
drinkable
mostly
because
there
isnt
much
flavor
there
to
dislike
would
be
good
on
a
hot
day
drinkability
next
question
please
this
one
is
not
worth
pondering
cheers
the
appearance
is
light
gold
with
a
fading
white
head
the
nose
has
light
grains
and
hops
a
corn
flavor
rudely
joins
the
grains
and
grassy
malts
and
im
picking
the
carbonated
water
in
taste
thank
god
none
of
those
have
more
than
very
mild
flavor
profiles
the
only
positive
that
thing
stuff
has
going
for
it
is
the
price
tag
but
even
so
it
is
more
expensive
than
high
life
and
pbr
neither
of
which
is
any
worse
drinkability
certainly
nothing
here
too
offensive
but
nothing
to
inspire
a
second
tasting
this
one
is
a
bit
tough
to
drink
in
the
grand
scheme
of
things
its
not
a
great
standout
lager
to
begin
with
but
the
mouthfeel
definitley
kills
this
and
draws
out
all
the
negatives
that
keep
this
beer
weighed
down
overall
my
sample
was
quite
clean
with
good
overall
balance
an
enjoyable
experience
this
beer
is
not
unlike
löwenbräu
it
is
in
offensive
possibly
because
there
is
not
a
lot
to
it
but
is
different
in
that
it
is
not
dominated
by
malty
sweetness
which
i
suppose
must
be
a
bt
of
a
positive
pours
a
clear
orange
hue
under
a
one
finger
white
head
that
lingers
reasonably
well
as
thick
film
and
collar
generating
no
lace
the
nose
is
nasty
strong
of
malt
and
cabbage
not
a
pleasant
experience
at
all
it
doesnt
seem
skunked
really
just
bad
the
mouth
is
light
and
harshly
prickly
the
taste
is
not
horrible
thanks
to
lots
of
sweet
and
bready
malt
theres
a
touch
of
peach
or
apricot
but
even
that
is
a
bit
on
the
overripe
side
very
little
hops
emerge
in
the
finish
as
just
a
tickle
of
dryness
in
the
throat
overall
this
beer
is
a
waste
of
time
guess
i
wasted
a
lot
of
time
in
my
early
days
in
kazakhstan
what
could
be
a
decent
eurolager
ends
up
becoming
rather
bland
and
boring
in
the
end
drinkable
and
possibly
a
good
hot
weather
brew
but
nothing
too
special
here
in
the
long
run
boring
beer
pours
out
to
a
light
yellow
color
witha
head
of
white
foam
that
loooks
like
someone
spit
in
my
beer
hints
of
lace
medium
low
level
of
carbonation
aromas
of
wet
cardboard
and
sulfuric
farts
ugh
flavor
is
weak
and
uninteresting
watery
malt
and
barely
a
touch
of
dry
hops
some
adjuncty
flavors
and
thats
about
it
mouthfeel
was
kind
of
bubbly
but
then
again
so
is
pepsi
i
wont
go
for
this
again
unless
its
free
and
im
already
fitshaced
pass
on
it
this
beer
poured
a
clear
bright
light
yellow
with
a
long
lasting
white
layer
of
foam
the
aroma
is
subtle
malt
not
overpowering
clean
and
nothing
out
of
place
the
taste
of
malt
struggled
to
overcome
the
sour
taste
the
sourness
lingered
for
a
long
time
on
the
tongue
the
mouthfeel
was
the
most
impressive
part
of
this
beer
the
carbonation
played
with
my
tongue
and
made
this
beer
enjoyable
i
dont
plan
on
buying
this
beer
again
it
is
not
bad
but
it
is
barely
average
a
decent
euro
lager
a
lot
like
staropramen
strong
straw
color
very
clear
and
carbonated
a
bit
sparkling
good
head
retention
that
fades
to
a
trace
aromas
are
mostly
grainy
cornlike
and
a
bit
lightstriken
not
bad
enough
to
call
skunky
grassy
earthy
and
yeasty
flavors
are
similar
throw
in
bready
hoppy
of
the
noble
variety
a
bit
citrusy
or
apple
like
finishes
crip
but
not
dry
refreshing
easily
drinkable
with
a
pizza
a
below

standar
pale
yellow

body
with

some

skunky

takes
us
into
the

finish
bleh
very
watery

even
for
the
style
there
are
much
better
eurotrash
lagers
out
there
drinkability
think
i
will
pass
on
this
was
strangely
somewhat
excited
to
try
this
one
because
my
friends
dad
swears
by
this
beer
he
grew
up
in
scotland
and
drank
nothing
but
guiness
smithwicks
etc
and
he
likes
this
the
best
i
think
that
deserves
a
wtf
not
horrid
but
i
dont
think
i
would
need
to
buy
this
one
again
okay
of
the
ten
beers
i
received
in
a
beers
of
the
world
gift
pack
this
is
the
only
one
that
came
in
a
pint
can
cannot
tell
too
much
of
a
difference
between
this
and
a
budweiser
except
the
latter
would
be
cheaper
to
buy
the
smell
is
worse
however
tastes
of
corn
and
other
vegetables
no
impressive
appearance
or
mouthfeel
qualities
i
guess
on
a
very
hot
day
if
this
were
very
cold
i
could
drink
a
couple
unless
i
had
pabst
or
schlitz
in
the
refrigerator
looks
like
the
can
tends
to
get
better
reviews
the
taste
has
hoppy
edge
to
it
but
alas
very
thin
and
somewhat
grassy
and
finishes
dry
big
coarse
white
foamy
head
clear
pale
gold
beer
sticky
spots
of

malty

some
corn
some

nice
enough
corn
syrup

the
thin
middle
sours
a
little
toward
the
sugary
bitter
finish
some
crackers
its
a
decent
sweet
lager
bought
in
a
16
oz
tallboy
typical
lager
to
look
at
golden
with
a
massive
frothy
white
head
the
aroma
is
quite
ok
neutral
mostly
hops
flavour
is
strane
its
ok
to
start
bready
semi
sweet
malts
then
theres
an
odd
bitterly
astringent
tastemaybe
its
the
hops
i
dont
know
strange
goes
well
enough
on
the
tongue
overall
this
is
not
very
good
had
many
better
dutch
lagers
pours
a
clear
light
gold
with
a
thin
white
head
aroma
is
nothing
more
than
a
light
bit
of
grain
same
thing
for
flavor
some
sweet
malt
with
no
discernible
hop
flavor
or
bitterness
no
real
off
flavors
but
then
again
no
real
flavors
to
speak
of
mouthfeel
was
slightly
acidic
and
dry
this
is
a
terribly
boring
beer
there
is
nothing
offensive
about
it
unless
you
are
offended
by
flavorless
fizzy
yellow
beer
but
i
can
find
no
reason
to
have
this
beer
over
almost
any
alternative
including
water
i
can
drink
this
but
why
colt
45
is
better
than
this
miller
lite
is
better
too
served
at
about
50
degrees
straw
pilsener
color
with

bready

prevails
in
the
aroma
with

of

mostly
sweet
maltiness
clean
tasting
with
a
slight
bit
of
dimethyl
sulfide
in

not
offensive

thin

smooth
drinkable
but
boring
appearance
clean
moderate
golden

no
head
to
speak
of
aroma
vey
sharp
hoppy
aroma
kind
of
like
the
bitter
lawn
clippings
oh
sorry
they
call
them
greens
they
put
into
expensive
salads
at
upscale
restaurants
very
bitter
smell
i
hope
i
didnt
hurt
my
nose
taste
the
sharp
bitter
aroma
follows
through
into
the
taste
it
isnt
as
noticeable
on
the
first
sip
but
it
strengthens
through
the
finish
i
think
there
are
some
floralcitrus
flavors
too
but
they
are
overwhelmed
by
bitterness
it
is
probably
pretty
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
while
mowing
the
lawn
but
today
isnt
one
of
those
days
even
if
your
hard
up
for
cash
and
want
a
beer
dont
bother
with
this
i
can
think
of
several
others
down
at
the
lower
rungs
of
the
price
scale
which
are
more
worthy
that
this
i
wouldnt
even
drink
this
beer
if
i
was
desperate
probably
the
worst
european
import
going
around
oranjeboom
is
an
odd
brew
that
ill
recommend
dont
expect
to
be
wowed
but
an
average
beer
worth
a
try
bottles
only
light
gold
color
medium

aroma
is
grainy
grassy

mildly
hopped

lightly
malted
good
crisp
clean

light

finish
is
clean

crisp
aftertaste
is
crisp
and
very
slightly
bitter
some
fruitiness
to
it
as
well
typical
eurolager
not
skunked
but
not
surprising
since
it
is
in
a

drinkable
but
nothing
special
the
rathskeller

comments

a
mixed
bag
for
sure
i
cant
believe
that
this
is
what
the
founders
had
in
mind
in
1671
not
too
bad
on
a
hot
day
a
step
up
from
the
macro
swill
if
thats
a
slight
compliment
wont
buy
it
again
if
something
better
appears
on
the
shelves
at
joes
not
a
glutton
for
punishment
but
payday
better
come
quick
this
beer
pours
a
light
yellow
color
with
little
head
and
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
slightly
malty
but
not
strong
at
all
the
flavor
is
very
soft
on
the
tongue
and
has
all
the
good
qualities
of
a
pilsner
its
very
easy
to
drink
and
quite
smooth
i
give
this
one
a
thumbs
up
didnt
find
anything
to
great
about
this
beer
it
poured
a
golden
amber
and
had
average
foam
for
a
lager
the
smell
was
nothing
to
write
home
about
i
could
smell
so
malt
but
nothing
outstanding
the
taste
was
just
ok
again
nothing
outstanding
that
would
make
me
try
it
again
a
great
looking
lager
beer
that
is
light
amber
to
dark
gold
with
a
half
inch
white
head
that
dissipates
moderately
quickly
superior
lacing
is
noted
from
the
remaining
ring
a
bit
of
a
skunky
smell
from
the
greenbottled
beer
but
not
highly
objectionable
remaining
aroma
is
somewhat
yeasty
the
taste
is
decently
balanced
with
no
overpowering
sweetness
or
bitterness
refreshing
overall
sense
and
quite
thirst
quenching
a
quaffable
brew
this
appears
to
be
it
pours
a
crystal
clear
golden
body
with
an
orangeish
cast
its
a
bit
darker
than
many
similar
lagers
the
bright
white
head
holds
well
before
dropping
to
a
creamy
collar
that
leaves
transient
lace
throughout
the
glass
a
clean
softly
grassy
and
gently
malty
nose
greets
you
its
lightmedium
body
appears
nicely
crisp
in
the
mouth
due
to
a
fine
median
carbonation
the
taste
however
is
quite
basic
with
a
wellbalanced
combination
of
moderately
grainy
malt
some
adjuncts
are
used
light
grassy
hop
flavor
and
restrained
bitterness
it
finishes
dry
and
refreshing
but
leaves
you
wanting
more
well
done
but
quite
mainstream
light
gold
little
effervesce
activity
sticky
white
head
vertical
strips
of
lace
skunky
nose
no

boringly
dry
yawn
a
boring
beer
through
through
skip
it
pours
a
clear
deep
golden
color
with
a
tall
and
foamy
white
head
that
fades
into
a
bubbly
and
sticky
lace
nose
is
fresh

with
a
touch
of
honeysuckle
very
light

and
quite
crisp
taste
is
sweet
malts
at
first
followed
by
some
strong
medicinal
notes
similar
to
mouthwash
very
unusual
this
is
not
a
beer
i
plan
to
try
again
anytime
soon
not
much
to
say
about
this
really
basically
is
about
as
flavourful
as
soda
water
average
looking
lager
with
zero
taste
and
this
was
recommended
to
me
in
a
bar
in
the
netherlands
last
time
i
go
to
that
bar
i
can
tell
you
that
much
really
so
little
to
say
cause
it
is
awful
but
i
have
to
keep
typing
or
it
wont
let
me
post
this
crystal
clear
medium
golden
color
with
sheets
of
carbonation
and
a
small
head
that
as
jason
says
looks
exactly
like
frothed
milk
the
head
retains
well
and
offers
lots
of
sticky
glass
coating
lace
massive
skunky
aroma
overpowers
the
sweet
malt
scents
and
slight
hops
taste
begins
with
faintly
sweet
malt
followed
by
cooked
vegetables
finishes
dry
with
a
harsh
medicinal
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
watery
although
the
head
is
wonderfully
creamy
this
beer
is
a
curious
mix
of
strengths
and
weaknesses
skunky
aroma
and
nice
pissyellow
color
i
hate
to
say
it
but
id
drink
a
heineken
before
this
truly
nasty
unfortunately
its
really
a
waste
of
a
cool
name
at
this
rate
i
am
staying
out
of
the
low
countries
no
different
from
things
like
heineken
bavaria
hollandia
etc
sweetish
flavour
light
in
body
and
taste
slight
skunkiness
a
bit
funky
but
generally
bland
its
hard
to
say
anything
good
about
it
except
its
drinkable
just
notes
there
is
not
much
to
this
lager
at
all
oddly
there
is
not
much
of
an
imported
flare
which
was
the
only
surprise
id
pick
a
domestic
us
macro
before
this
one
the
only
thing
that
saved
this
beer
for
me
was
that
it
was
quite
clean
with
not
too
many
off
flavours
or
aromas
top
5
beers
in
my
opinion
500ml
bottle
bb
290415
pours
a
very
pale
gold
colour
with
a
dense
white
head
which
disappeared
quickly
and
left
minimal
lacing
metallic
aroma
with
some
corn
and
malt
slight
malty
sweetness
with
mild
spicy
hop
bitterness
some
alcoholic
warmth
and
the
finish
is
quite
dry
but
has
an
almost
salty
mineral
quality
to
it
great
european
lager
almost
perfectly
balanced
nice
and
hoppy
very
crisp
and
refreshing
i
would
definitely
get
this
again
o
k
beer
from
browar
okocim
s
a
with
an
abv
of
5
6
this
brew
pours
out
a
nice
golden
amber
color
with
a
nice
white
head
the
smell
is
sweet
with
grains
and
malt
nothing
bad
so
far
the
taste
is
sweet
but
this
brew
has
a
smooth
finish
you
pick
up
on
some
grains
in
the
taste
of
this
brew
to
me
this
brew
is
like
an
american
lager
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
clean
there
is
no
bad
aftertaste
browar
okocim
s
a
did
a
nice
job
with
this
brew
overall
im
giving
this
brew
a
4
out
5
this
brew
was
better
than
what
i
was
expecting
i
would
buy
this
brew
again
overall
a
tasty
euro
lager
better
than
most
o
easy
drinking
basic
lager
overall
this
is
definitely
more
then
o
k
beer
a
lager
that
hits
all
the
traditional
points
it
should
while
having
some
pleasant
hop
tones
which
take
it
to
the
next
level
and
for
5
a
4pk
this
one
is
going
to
be
a
staple
in
my
fridge
for
a
long
time
i
poured
this
into
a
glass
it
has
a
golden
color
body
with
a
very
small
head
that
fades
to
a
thin
lace
around
the
edge
of
the
glass
the
smell
has
a
sweetness
to
it
and
also
a
little
malt
and
corn
the
taste
is
sweet
and
has
a
grainy
flavor
to
it
the
malt
is
kinda
there
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
is
very
drinkable
this
reminds
me
of
a
much
better
version
of
stella
artois
large
noticeable
malt
presence
but
if
the
sweetness
was
dialed
down
a
bit
this
would
be
real
impressive
o
this
is
much
better
than
the
last
poland
beer
i
tasted
o
k
beer
is
arguably
the
best
euro
pale
lager
ive
come
across
while
not
a
particularly
exciting
style
its
good
to
know
that
there
are
examples
of
it
that
taste
good
o
of
all
the
polish
macros
on
the
market
this
is
easily
the
best
its
a
simple
lager
but
it
offers
a
pleasantly
straightforward
drinking
experience
with
more
flavor
and
character
than
the
others
can
offer
a
perfect
pairing
for
polish
cuisine
it
can
stand
up
to
any
sausage
and
has
the
power
to
cut
through
more
fatty
and
flavorful
dishes
overall
drinkability
interesting
lager
earthy
overall
is
a
good
way
i
would
describe
this
beer
but
definitely
something
that
works
in
large
servings
a
500ml
bottle
is
a
good
serving
size
for
this
beer
nothing
so
strong
in
flavor
that
you
tire
of
it
but
at
a
weakness
in
flavor
that
you
need
a
whole
bottle
to
really
get
to
know
it
then
again
i
suspect
a
beer
like
this
has
been
crafted
solely
to
drink
in
large
quantities
with
food
i
did
not
have
this
with
food
but
i
can
see
that
it
would
go
really
well
with
a
wide
range
of
meat
potato
dishes
probably
some
heartier
vegetable
dishes
as
well
so
nicely
drinkable
but
overall
nothing
amazing
nice
looking
color
though
strangely
like
the
bottle
says
its
an
ok
beer
not
bad
not
exactly
good
pretty
much
standard
for
the
style
which
has
its
place
but
just
not
interesting
enough
to
bother
buying
again
overall
for
my
introduction
into
polish
brew
i
cant
say
im
flabbergasted
and
about
to
shout
it
on
the
mountain
top
but
this
lager
is
genuine
i
feel
im
starting
to
fall
in
love
with
most
euro
lagers
for
their
affinity
for
being
clean
and
straightforward
that
der
brew
dis
oky
doky
wit
me
brew
clear
yellow
beer
with
little
head
smell
is
weak
maybe
malty
floral
scent
but
hard
to
tell
taste
is
clear
crisp
with
malty
tones
clean
mouthfeel
with
little
aftertaste
refreshing
beer
moderately
bubbly
pretty
tasty
beer
i
would
buy
more
o
this
was
a
very
pleasant
surprise
and
very
high
on
the
drinkability
dimension
this
beer
was
one
of
the
cheaper
offerings
at
the
hennessey
market
in
uptown
butte
montana
6
99
for
a
four
pack
of
pint
cans
which
is
equivalent
to
craft
brew
on
sale
or
clearance
in
this
town
at
this
price
it
is
well
worth
the
money
and
well
worth
the
try
not
something
i
would
buy
again
except
for
the
novelty
overall
a
good
warm
weather
beer
would
be
nice
with
some
brats
on
the
grill
overall
not
an
expert
in
this
style
but
this
is
a
good
beer
on
hot
humid
day
like
today
okay
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
brassstraw
topped
by
a
finger
of
lightly
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
old
wheat
and
light
dry
grass
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
along
with
a
strong
vein
of
odd
fruitiness
and
an
aftertaste
laden
with
the
dust
of
many
unkempt
attic
rooms
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
fluid
feel
overall
a
pretty
weak
and
oddtasting
beer
one
i
couldnt
easily
say
okay
to
any
time
soon
much
like
the
baltika
brew
i
had
the
other
night
skunky
aromas
fill
my
senses
as
soon
as
i
pop
the
top
on
this
bottle
pours
a
crystal
clear
golden
color
with
a
decent
sized
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
to
a
cap
after
airing
out
a
bit
the
skunk
is
still
in
the
room
but
maybe
my
nose
is
used
to
the
smell
a
bit
because
i
can
find
some
bready
pils
and
a
hint
of
flowers
the
flavor
is
a
bit
better
than
the
aroma
advertised
nice
sweet
bready
malt
presence
with
a
hint
of
graininess
theres
a
firm
spicy
hop
bit
that
provides
a
great
balance
to
the
malty
sweetness
carbonic
acid
is
a
bit
high
and
does
detract
a
bit
medium
body
with
a
sweet
bubbly
mouthfeel
and
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
not
a
bad
brew
after
it
airs
out
a
bit
o
this
beer
is
a
simpleflavored
pale
lager
that
is
very
easy
to
drink
on
tap
at
the
new
world
of
beers
on
colorado
boulevard
from
poland
i
reckon
this
beer
pours
a
really
light
pale
straw
color
with
a
big
and
full
white
head
with
o
k
retention
pun
intended
generic
nose
of
spent
crystal
malt
and
everyday
yeast
there
is
a
light
lemony
flavor
up
front
but
after
that
this
is
your
classic
eastern
european
wash
not
poorly
made
just
terribly
uninteresting
its
plenty
sessionable
though
with
a
really
light
body
and
a
relatively
excited
mouthfeel
a
curious
beer
to
import
since
its
like
so
many
that
are
made
here
at
home
but
i
guess
variety
is
the
spice
of
life
even
if
there
isnt
much
spice
happening
in
this
brew
my
molson
drinking
old
man
would
like
it
but
it
didnt
strike
a
chord
with
me
it
was
just
o
k
fine
i
will
stop
now
im
more
of
an
ipa
type
but
also
a
saas
hops
pilsner
fan
not
much
better
than
a
cold
urquell
on
a
hot
day
also
shamelessly
a
heineken
fan
as
far
as
goto
refreshing
daily
drinkers
go
this
o
k
beerokocim
is
a
worthy
addition
to
the
aforementioned
brews
when
in
the
mood
for
a
crisp
lagerpilsner
with
a
bit
of
a
bitey
overtone
i
like
a
lil
skunk
in
my
junk
plus
you
can
bash
someone
over
the
head
with
the
heavy
eastern
europeanstyle
bottle
if
the
occasion
arises
o
k
indeed
o
overall
the
title
holds
true
its
an
ok
beer
id
say
its
in
the
slightly
above
average
beer
its
very
tolerable
not
offensive
or
overbearing
but
its
not
something
i
would
call
outstanding
its
pretty
decent
so
its
worth
a
go
o
a
plain
lager
neither
here
nor
there
overall
its
an
adjunct
lager
with
a
polish
label
on
it
im
sure
that
are
excellent
beers
from
poland
but
this
isnt
one
of
them
o
this
is
a
solid
example
of
lager
its
a
step
or
two
up
from
a
bud
of
bug
light
thats
for
sure
its
nothing
spectacular
but
what
can
you
really
expect
from
the
style
its
drinkable
and
enjoyable
if
youre
in
the
mood

pours
like
apple
juice
with
carbonation
with
a
bright
white
head
forming
and
fleeting
quickly
aroma
has
cooked
cereal
grains
flowing
with
a
slight
metallic
character
and
herbal
hop
aromatics
this
is
euro
pale
lager
with
a
definite
bite
to
it
a
bit
harsh
flavor
grows
on
you
with
a
sweet
husky
grain
character
minimal
hop
flavor
a
bit
one
dimensional
in
the
euro
lager
department
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
cloying
with
some
residual
sugars
carbonation
a
bit
rough
uneven
flowing
beer
across
the
palate
drinkability
isnt
what
i
have
in
mind
for
a
relaxing
friday
night
beer
drinking
experience
from
the
500
ml
bottle
sampled
on
march
24
2012
the
pour
is
the
ideal
golden
yellow
for
a
pale
beer
with
constant
upwardly
flowing
delicate
carbonation
bubbles
and
a
lingering
white
head
the
aroma
is
bready
with
the
yeast
strain
they
must
use
along
with
a
mild
hop
character
in
the
background
the
body
is
light
to
medium
the
taste
has
an
astringent
bitterness
attached
to
it
along
with
the
bready
malts
and
clean
hopped
finale
this
is
a
good
lawn
mower
beer
out
of
a
bottle
this
beer
was
a
clear
golden
color
with
one
finger
of
white
head
the
retention
was
good
as
a
cap
at
first
but
it
soon
became
a
thin
collar
the
lacing
was
spotty
the
aroma
was
of
cereal
grains
and
sweet
malt
the
flavors
were
very
standard
in
my
opinion
i
tasted
the
cereal
grains
and
sweet
malt
but
also
a
bit
of
european
hops
that
gave
it
as
clean
finish
the
euro
pale
lager
style
tends
to
be
very
bland
and
this
was
a
good
example
of
what
can
be
done
with
it
but
i
still
had
trouble
being
impressed
with
such
a
beer
still
it
is
to
be
said
the
mouthfeel
was
good
the
body
medium
and
the
carbonation
spoton
it
was
indeed
ok
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pils
glass
very
light
body
almost
see
through
some
nice
carbonation
and
a
tiny
wispy
white
head
its
just
so
watery
looking
smell
was
grainy
and
grassy
taste
was
average
since
it
didnt
have
any
skunky
flavors
i
was
expecting
it
tasted
fairly
fresh
mouthfeel
was
pretty
limp
and
boring
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
on
the
back
of
the
throat
this
beer
didnt
turn
me
off
so
i
drank
it
effortlessly
probably
halfway
decent
on
tap
in
poland
but
out
of
the
bottle
it
was
barely
ok
overall
ok
price
is
a
important
factors
for
me
in
judging
a
beer
there
are
some
inexpensive
beers
that
really
measure
up
this
six
pack
was
7
99
around
the
price
of
heineken
st
pauli
and
other
imported
beers
for
the
price
is
nothing
to
write
home
about
in
fact
i
am
a
little
disappointed
there
are
better
beers
for
around
5
99
the
after
taste
is
pretty
good
i
can
see
how
some
people
would
be
turned
on
by
this
beer
id
rather
drink
sewer
water
honestly
notes
balanced
with
a
very
soft
mouthfeel
a
tad
too
much
body
for
the
style
but
still
quite
easy
to
put
back
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
it
has
its
flaws
yet
it
excels
in
the
style
othis
is
like
a
slightly
very
slightly
better
version
of
an
american
light
beer
its
a
lot
more
balanced
and
smooth
than
other
euro
pale
lagers
that
ive
had
the
higher
alcohol
seems
to
be
completely
hidden
overall
its
a
very
boring
beer
that
i
wont
be
needing
to
get
again
unless
my
only
other
choice
is
an
american
adjunct
pours
a
clear
yellow
with
a
2
inch
foamy
white
head
that
fades
to
a
think
film
on
the
top
of
the
beer
broken
rings
of
lace
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
fresh
grains
grasshay
notes
and
some
sweetness
taste
is
of
grains
grass
and
some
sweet
honeylike
flavors
on
the
finish
mild
bitterness
on
the
palate
after
each
sip
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
and
clean
mouthfeel
on
this
one
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
lager
out
of
poland
i
need
to
seek
out
the
baltic
porter
from
this
brewery
as
well
my
can
states
that
the
abv
is
5
6
the
desciption
above
says
6
2
perhaps
they
lightened
up
the
beer
a
little
to
make
it
more
drinkable
certainly
the
last
time
i
have
this
one
but
im
oddly
not
upset
about
this
one
the
fact
that
it
is
about
2
bucks
a
bottle
doesnt
hurt
overall
this
is
my
new
goto
lager
beer
im
cleaning
out
bevmos
shelves
of
this
stuff
the
next
time
i
go
back
at
just
over
a
dollar
a
pint
this
is
the
best
random
buy
ive
ever
made
d
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
with
this
one
pouring
the
can
into
a
pint
glass
creates
a
decentsized
head
which
dissolves
in
less
than
30
seconds
smells
very
sweet
and
fruity
almost
like
a
watery
cider
tastes
pretty
sweet
also
like
fruit
and
bread
there
is
some
slight
bitterness
as
well
o
k
beer
is
more
than
okay
well
what
can
one
say
about
a
typical
european
tasting
beer
that
hasnt
already
been
said
this
beer
pours
a
clear
pale
yellow
with
white
head
and
ok
lacing
the
smell
is
grainywheaty
and
surprise
surprise
so
is
the
taste
this
beer
is
boosted
by
6
2
abv
which
makes
its
drinkability
and
mouthfeel
not
as
nice
a
more
subtle
euro
beer
like
pils
urquel
or
its
bretherin
okocim
premium
not
tasty
enough
to
risk
a
big
hangover
during
a
session
but
some
make
enjoy
a
mighty
fine
lager
props
to
my
friends
and
possible
ancestors
in
poland
for
this
one
this
is
definitely
an
ok
beer
wife
enjoyed
it
as
well
e11iottjan
10
for
the
style
its
not
a
bad
smelling
beer
at
all
the
taste
is
the
same
as
the
aroma

to

for
the

from
a
16
oz
can
has
a
golden
color
with
a
12
inch

smell
is
slightly
sweet
woodychandler
i
would
drunk
this
instead
of
water
and
i
cant
say
that
of
many
lagers
it
was
ok
still
overall
a
nice
beer
d
the
only
real
flavor
is
the
buttered
corn
qualities
which
are
a
bit
to
much
but
the
slight
sweetness
adds
some
nice
depth
to
the
grain
hints
overall
overall
the
beer
was
average
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
pale
lagers
but
its
decent
for
its
style
clear
golden
color
with
a
large
head
that
slowly
settled
to
a
thick
cap
just
a
little
lacing
is
left
behind
smells
almost
like
an
ale
fruity
and
bready
nothing
too
surprising
in
the
flavor
has
that
eastern
european
lager
taste
also
slightly
sweeter
than
pale
lagers
has
some
interesting
fruit
notes
of
apricots
and
peaches
substantial
body
for
a
pale
lager
a
little
slick
i
found
this
better
than
ok
one
of
the
more
interesting
lagers
that
come
out
of
that
part
of
the
world
or
almost
anything
else
in
carlsbergs
portfolio
o
k
beer
that
about
sums
it
up
the
beer
pours
as
clear
as
the
morning
with
a
cap
of
quickly
dissipating
foam
doesnt
look
to
bad
really
the
aroma
comes
off
sweet
bready
and
perhaps
a
hint
of
corn
on
palate
however
it
starts
light
just
the
right
amount
of
sweetness
and
ends
with
a
snap
of
bitterness
sweetness
lingers
on
the
palate
a
bit
too
long
though
like
i
said
an
ok
beer
d
a
decent
beer
that
drinks
better
on
the
colder
side
a
bit
too
sweet
d
not
the
worst
beer
ive
had
but
far
from
the
best
something
i
dont
think
i
will
seek
out
again
d
the
drinkability
on
this
one
is
god
awful
i
remember
almost
liking
this
one
when
i
was
a
little
younger
but
now
i
just
dont
know
i
had
a
hard
time
drinking
this
one
and
ended
up
drain
pouring
the
last
quater
of
my
pint
good
beer
metallic
copper
flavors
are
noticeable
but
not
overpowering
smell
nothing
special
a
nice
grainy
crunchy
mouthfeel
crisp
carbonation
and
flavors
of
light
hoppy
citrus
balanced
by
an
equal
background
of
malt
an
interesting
beer
and
hard
to
categorize
it
is
amazing
this
stuff
can
be
had
for
1
for
a
bottle
or
can
great
value
for
your
money
with
this
brew
high
alcohol
vs
others
in
this
style
but
again
this
beer
has
its
own
personality
could
be
a
guzzler
because
it
goes
down
easy
but
the
high
abv
will
creep
up
on
you
not
delicious
but
very
good
d
very
drinkable
i
am
surprised
at
the
simple
quality
of
this
brew
d
average
lager
not
bad
but
not
special
d
this
one
is
what
it
is
a
middle
of
of
the
road
euro
pale
lager
clean
crisp
and
dry
without
a
lot
of
character
it
is
not
overly
exciting
but
it
is
easy
to
drink
d
like
the
name
says
o
k
drink
ability
from
an
o
k
beer
damn
drinkable
super
slammin
good
stuff
okocim
and
poland
can
be
proud
of
this
yummy
nearly
perfect
lager
went
down
smooth
and
is
quite
drinkable
overall
a
decent
beer
but
nothing
special
tastewise
and
like
the
name
itself
its
o
k
mouth
feel
is
smooth
i
could
drink
this
all
night
beer
is
almost
always
better
on
tap
and
i
think
that
some
of
the
issues
other
had
with
this
were
noticeable
for
me
a
great
refreshing
crisp
pale
lager
drinkability
is
ok
would
prefer
some
more
flavor
up
front
but
a
decent
beer
lawnmower
brew
drinkability
is
good
o
k
beer
is
a
very
refreshing
pale
that
definitely
quenches
thirst
there
is
a
good
balance
on
a
lot
of
the
taste
but
nothing
to
go
out
of
your
way
for
d
the
definition
of
drinkablesessionable
and
while
it
is
not
that
interesting
it
is
simultaneously
entirely
inoffensive
in
every
way
i
could
kill
multiple
bottles
in
a
sitting
easily
i
had
3
dollars
left
after
i
bought
the
rest
of
my
beer
and
tried
this
one
it
pours
and
looks
exactly
like
a
bud
or
miller
the
taste
was
rather
skunky
and
had
an
unpleasant
after
taste
to
it
it
reminded
me
of
the
taste
of
steel
reserve
although
it
is
nice
to
try
new
things
this
is
not
a
quality
beer
overall
i
found
it
to
be
a
terrible
beer
pale
gold
and
crystal
clear
with
a
nice
fizzy
head
and
minimal
lace
smells
nice
and
hoppy
citric
with
toasted
grain
tastes
good
fairly
nice
hop
bite
balances
well
with
malt
sweetness
seltzery
carbonation
and
light
bodied
finishes
squeaky
clean
a
good
example
of
the
style
and
stronger
than
most
taste
is
pretty
light
more
so
than
the
nose
indicates
extremely
smooth
flavor
profile
but
my
bottle
is
starting
to
show
signs
of
oxidation
and
the
hops
dont
taste
as
fresh
as
they
could
hop
bitterness
is
pretty
low
and
really
creates
an
unbalanced
taste
leaning
toward
very
pale
sweet
malts
does
not
have
much
specialty
grain
flavor
its
ok
and
has
the
potential
to
taste
pretty
good
fresh
but
pretty
average
euro
for
me
pale
golden
straw
with
a
decent
pure
white
head
and
perfectly
clear
the
rest
is
like
any
macro
lager
but
with
a
little
more
in
each
area
im
not
sensing
adjuncts
in
this
minimal
nose
of
grassy
continental
hops
and
biscuity
pale
malts
taste
follows
suit
with
a
pretty
even
balance
feels
lighterbodied
than
the
abv
would
suggest
i
would
think
that
there
could
be
more
character
for
a
6
2
beer
it
is
just
o
k
okaaay
highly
recommend
this
to
anyone
looking
for
a
pilsneresque
beer
d
a
very
drinkable
lager
happy
that
i
tried
it
drinkability
is
very
good
i
definitely
recommend
this
to
anyone
interested
in
european
pale
ales
or
just
something
completely
different
in
general
top
notch
stuff
drinkability
high
on
my
list
because
of
family
heritage
overall
a
nice
experience
to
share
with
other
family
members
probably
not
for
everyone
what
i
like
about
this
beer
is
that
is
smells
like
mustard
nice
brown
spicy
mustard
but
behind
that
lies
a
fresh
bready
and
nutty
sweetness
i
sear
this
smells
like
a
piece
of
whole
wheat
bread
with
nice
thick
spread
of
spicy
mustard
on
it
already
i
am
thinking
about
how
well
this
would
pair
with
a
corned
beer
sammich
taste
is
again
crisp
grassy
but
really
more
of
a
bright
and
slightly
sweet
beer
i
really
wish
the
spiciness
of
the
nose
remained
in
the
taste
but
instead
it
becomes
a
bit
washed
out
and
muted
in
the
sweeter
maltier
aspects
of
this
beer
i
mean
its
there
but
i
almost
wish
it
were
overstated
i
know
i
know
its
totally
american
of
my
to
say
that
but
damn
it
im
an
american
a
proud
american
to
steal
from
the
simpsons
i
like
my
beer
cold
my
t
v
loud
and
my
homosexuals
flaming
and
so
it
goes
with
this
beer
and
like
many
current
episodes
and
like
the
beer
itself
says
on
the
bottle
its
just
o
k
i
got
this
from
a
variety
sample
pack
from
world
market
from
the
label
i
honestly
was
not
expecting
much
from
this
beer
but
i
guess
the
poles
know
how
to
do
it
right
this
is
a
very
good
pale
lager
very
crisp
and
refreshing
this
was
very
good
and
i
would
certainly
drink
this
again
if
it
were
easily
available
overall
a
good
beer
not
a
bad
pilsner
i
rather
enjoyed
drinking
this
i
thin
pilsners
are
one
of
my
favorite
styles
probably
popular
in
the
area
its
brewed
in
but
this
one
isnt
impressing
me
more
light
husky
grains
and
not
much
else
one
of
my
fathers
polish
friends
from
work
brought
home
a
6er
of
this
the
european
saaz
hops
are
clearly
present
and
make
this
a
nice
drinkable
light
beer
a
pretty
high
abv
for
the
style
but
its
very
smooth
and
undetectable
i
havent
tried
too
many
imports
but
this
one
makes
me
want
to
try
a
lot
more
this
one
isnt
bad
nothing
to
seek
out
in
the
states
but
probably
a
decent
option
to
remember
when
in
eastern
europe
decently
drinkable
the
beer
is
a
nice
golden
transparent
lager
with
little
head
but
sparkling
carbonation
the
nose
is
slightly
malty
but
the
real
maltiness
of
this
brew
bursts
all
over
your
palate
with
the
first
good
mouthfull
a
very
smooth
finish
with
mild
bitterness
and
more
malt
at
the
end
coupled
with
a
perfect
texture
in
the
mouth
make
this
a
great
beer
for
summer
drinking
a
bit
high
in
alcohol
for
a
session
beer
but
if
the
weekend
afternoon
is
long
and
hot
and
youve
got
a
good
place
to
sit
while
you
watch
the
beautiful
polish
people
walk
by
well
why
not
make
a
2liter
session
out
of
it
even
if
you
feel
a
bit
light
at
the
end
not
great
simple
and
delightful
a
good
brew
as
a
conventional
lager
turns
out
it
wasnt
too
bad
its
light
and
easy
to
drink
but
it
doesnt
have
any
real
distinct
aspect
about
that
i
could
categorize
overall
i
wont
remember
drinking
this
beer
in
5
minutes
utterly
forgettable
i
suspect
like
others
that
have
negatively
reviewed
this
beer
that
i
got
a
skunkedold
bottle
i
need
zero
ratings
for
this
beer
because
it
didnt
even

thanks
joe
man
this
is
one
of
those
straightforward
delicious
lagers
recommended
given
the
other
reviews
i
can
only
assume
that
i
had
a
very
bad
very
skunked
sample
the
lesson
to
readers
make
sure
your
bottle
is
reasonably
fresh
before
you
begin
your
tasting
pours
a

with
a
one

white
head
with
great
retention
and
lots
of
little
bubbles
rising
in
the
glass
sweet
orange

aromas
with

tea
and
fresh
cut

toasted

up

with
light
tealemon
hop
mixed
in
and
some
bright
citrus
medium
carbonation
and
body
starts
with
a
creamy
mouthfeel
that
becomes
cleansing
easy
drinking
beer
unlike
anything
else
ive
tried
and
very
moderately
priced
this
beer
is
more
than
o
k
it
is
delicious
poured
a
very
clear
palegold
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
the
head
retention
is
very
good
the
lacing
is
light
but
nice
the
aroma
is
kind
of
grainy
and
lightly
hoppy
there
is
a
slight
metal
flavor
to
it
the
is
a
slight
butterscotch
flavor
also
which
is
cool
very
clean
sweet
and
malty
the
hop
flavor
is
light
but
nice
this
tastes
great
especially
considering
its
at
6
2
percent
abv
the
feel
is
smooth
and
barely
tingly
from
the
light
carbonation
no
skunk
no
harshness
nice
d
i
am
disappointed
this
isnt
even
a
very
good
pilsener
probably
wouldnt
pick
this
one
up
again
drinkability
refreshing
but
to
expensive
for
what
it
is
pours
clear
yellowgold
with
a
thin
head
that
vanishes
almost
instantly
aroma
is
grassy
with
a
bit
of
skunk
to
it
taste
is
grassy
with
faint
malts
theres
a
faint
hop
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
quite
effervescent
easy
to
drink
but
not
much
there
to
create
any
excitement
mk
dits
a
decent
beer
and
i
might
consider
a
six
pack
of
this
nothing
to
extraordinary
though
full
pale
that
is
a
bit
light
in
color
with
a
creamy
head
not
macro
like
though
from
a
vigorous
pour
the
head
holds
aroma
is
hgently
hoppy
but
mostly
sweet
pale
malts
taste
is
like
an
unhoppy
pils
very
much
like
harp
good
flavor
but
tamer
than
heineken
say
sweeter
less
hoppy
also
while
ithis
doesnt
taste
old
its
missing
that
fresh
taste
that
im
used
to
from
more
local
brews
and
careful
date
checking
mouthfeel
is
carbonated
medium
bodied
for
a
pale
lager
overall
its
truly
o
k
beer
i
prefer
a
pils
which
this
is
not
and
was
hoping
for
a
score
for
my
fridge
here
but
it
was
a
miss
a
likable
beer
in
its
own
right
but
not
even
close
to
balanced
or
fresh
enough
for
me
will
recommend
this
to
less
picky
drinkers
that
might
prefer
a
tame
but
taste
pale
lager
in
a
big
bottle
or
12er
for
a
fair
price
the
color
is
a
lovely
gold
with
a
uniform
centimeter
thick
head
the
head
dissipates
quickly
carbonation
is
active
but
not
excessive
a
pretty
beer
in
the
american
pint
glass
smell
is
surprising
clean
but
also
quite
light
just
a
hint
of
malt
but
no
skunkiness
solid
malty
flavor
far
more
than
i
expected
for
this
style
no
fizzy
offputting
weakness
mouthfeel
is
alright
the
finish
is
sweet
and
crisp
a
very
enjoyable
beer
that
is
exceedingly
drinkable
i
will
seek
this
out
for
a
warmer
weather
easy
drinker
poured
from
bottle
into
hefe
glass
pours
light
golden
crystal
clear
and
a
nice
thick
fluffy
head
somewhat
poor
retention
and
lacing
smell
is
of
some
malt
grass
and
skunk
taste
is
heavy
on
the
malt
some
grassystrawlike
tastes
as
well
with
some
light
bread
tastes
somewhat
bitter
aftertaste
overall
nice
and
crisp
light
mouthfeel
i
have
a
feeling
this
would
be
great
on
a
nice
summer
day
while
its
not
a
great
beer
its
better
than
a
heine
or
becks
and
was
an
easy
drinker
i
should
note
that
my
bottle
lists
the
abv
as
5
6
i
checked
the
other
beers
from
this
brewer
and
this
is
definitly
the
same
one
the
labels
are
identitical
but
the
abv
is
apparently
different
this
beer
poured
a
golden
color
with
a
lingering
twofinger
head
it
has
malty
aroma
with
a
little
hint
of
something
early
like
grass
or
straw
the
taste
is
a
mix
of
malts
and
hops
with
a
surprising
amount
of
alcohol
feel
that
tends
to
linger
on
the
palate
its
a
fairly
crisp
tasting
beer
that
isnt
unpleasant
to
drink
the
label
says
it
all
this
beer
is
simply
o
k
i
think
this
is
my
first
polish
beer
how
exciting
anyway
pours
a
light
golden
color
with
hardly
any
head
whatsoever
looks
very
macroish
but
smells
quite
skunky
taste
is
surprisingly
smooth
has
a
skunkiess
to
the
taste
it
is
a
decent
lager
all
around
better
than
a
bmc
from
what
i
can
tell
but
im
not
much
of
a
lager
fan
overall
this
is
a
nice
pale
ale
one
that
wont
knock
the
socks
off
but
one
you
shouldnt
turn
down
not
in
my
top
five
pale
ales
but
a
pretty
good
beer
perhaps
this
is
the
best
of
the
lawnmower
beers
i
wouldnt
seek
out
this
beer
again
but
it
was
interesting
to
try
id
say
it
would
be
an
easy
drinker
but
there
are
many
other
beers
of
this
type
which
are
much
better
while
im
not
a
fan
of
their
stronger
mocne
this
diluted
offering
hit
the
spot
beware
the
alcohol
is
a
little
heavy
to
make
it
a
session
brew
500ml
bottle
appearance
is
not
very
appetizing
paleshallow
yellow
almost
no

at
all
just
urine
like

aroma
however
is
a
big
improvement
lightly
hoppy
but
fresh
like
hay
pale
sweet
malts
underneath
low
carbonation
slightly
grassy
semisweet
malts
long
low
bitter
finish
i
liked
this
on
the
palate
the
low
carbonation
made
for
a
smooth
mouthfeel
which
i
like
in
a
beer
over
all
a
nice
enough
lager
and
pretty
drinkable
overall
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
extremely
easy
to
drink
but
gives
nothing
up
in
flavor
looks
like
this
beer
is
now
owned
by
carlsberg
d
a
good
euro
pale
lager
one
of
the
best
from
continental
europe
that
i
have
had
refreshing
on
a
hot
summers
day
especially
after
manual
labour
the
porter
is
this
brewerys
masterpiece
but
this
lager
aint
too
shabby
as
they
say
if
youre
looking
for
a
cheap
inexpensive
beer
with
flavour
try
this
the
abv
is
there
and
you
can
tell
it
was
a
good
beer
but
nothing
i
would
buythe
sweetness
just
got
to
me
it
didnt
have
that
skunky
taste
either
that
i
incorparate
with
euro
lagers
overall
a
good
brew
intresting
pale
lager
to
me
it
was
fairly
well
balanced
unlike
many
euro
pales
i
would
drink
this
over
becks
hein
ect
any
day
give
it
a
try
overall
another
hohum
euro
lager
the
name
says
it
allok

poured
from
the
500ml
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
the
pale
straw
body
is
topped
by
a
sizeable
creamy
white
head
that
dissipates
almost
immediately
ample
carbonation
keeps
the
bubbles
coming
pleasant
aroma
of
slightly
sweet
carapils
and
adjunct
malts
with
a
nice
biscuity
character
palate
is
nice
light
and
wellbalanced
a
sweet
malt
character
up
front
melds
with
a
decent
dose
of
european
hops
to
provide
some
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
a
bit
creamy
very
enjoyable
not
particularly
groundbreaking
but
a
wellconstructed
eastern
european
lager
not
too
drinkable
to
my
tastes
due
to
an
unpleasant
aftertaste
and
too
strong
in
abv
to
be
a
summer
cooler
poured
a
light
golden
high
carbonation
small
head
smell
of
slight
light
hop
not
too
aromatic
tasted
metallic
and
small
bitter
too
much
fizz
for
this
kid
however
smooth
and
a
lightmedium
bodied
it
was
worth
the
try
good
pilsner
representation
bottom
line
try
okocims
porter
its
imho
the
best
beer
ever
brewed
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
a
big
malty
backbone
starts
out
the
front
giving
it
a
smooth
sweet
taste
without
becoming
overpowering
theres
a
pleasant
hop
profile
here
that
is
a
bit
out
of
the
ordinary
but
i
enjoyed
it
you
never
experience
a
graincorn
quality
to
the
taste
and
its
not
skunky
at
all
unlike
many
light
euro
beers
the
finish
is
smooth
clean
and
has
a
pleasant
aftertaste
to
be
honest
this
is
a
fantastic
session
beer
that
id
love
to
find
more
of
certainly
the
best
euro
pale
lager
ive
had
to
date
and
a
great
alternative
to
the
macro
euros
this
one
was
looking
intresting
for
a
try
and
my
first
beer
from
poland
poured
a
golden
pale
yellow
no
head
no
lace
but
a
nice
visible
stream
of
carbonation
classic
euro
lager
look
smell
was
very
light
corn
grain
bread
sort
of
a
musky
smell
again
pretty
run
of
the
mill
for
the
style
the
taste
was
crisp
and
clean
classic
lager
grainy
malted
taste
slight
hint
at
the
european
hops
very
smooth
and
a
classic
session
beer
overall
it
was
oklol
i
could
easily
put
down
several
of
these
on
a
hot
day
nothing
terribly
spectacular
but
definatly
not
bad
id
definitely
buy
this
again
for
an
afternoon
of
watching
sportstailgaiting
or
for
watching
a
movie
at
home
with
friends
for
the
style
this
one
is
pretty
good
while
the
typical
epl
sweetness
is
there
there
is
an
aboveaverage
hoppiness
and
spiciness
that
makes
this
one
stand
out
ok
beer
is
more
than
ok
a
decent
pale
euro
lager
im
guessing
its
probably
better
fresh
in
europe
but
my
bottle
was
alright
the
hops
seemed
a
bit
skunked
but
at
least
there
were
hops
with
the
style
it
was
light
with
a
fruity
flavor
from
the
yeast
add
a
touch
of
hops
and
a
little
grain
an
easy
drinking
beer
but
nothing
amazing
bottle
smell
is
malty
sweet
for
a
lager
pours
to
a
honey
bronze
color
with
a
good
head
that
quickly
disappears
taste
is
full
palate
a
strong
malty
taste
with
slight
bitter
hop
taste
detectable
throughout
a
classic
lager
finish
surprisingly
high
ac
not
at
all
detectable
a
well
brewed
beer
good
balance
of
tastes
very
drinkable

would
drink
again
in
a
pinch
part
of
my
beer
of
the
month
club
delivery
this
beer
is
in
a
brown
bottle
with
a
really
cute
label
with
some
eastern
european
artwork
on
it
and
surprisingly
o
k
beer
is
more
than
just
that
pours
a
very
clear
although
solid
looking
golden
yellow
big
white
foamy
head
that
disappeared
into
a
nice
lacing
although
the
lacing
disappeared
as
the
beer
was
consumed
the
aroma
is
pretty
strong
for
a
beer
that
may
initially
come
off
as
being
possibly
weak
in
stature
nose
is
full
of
strong
polish
hops
with
just
a
tiny
hint
of
sweetness
and
alcohol
smells
like
a
strong
pilsner
actually
the
taste
starts
out
with
the
same
hops
in
the
aroma
i
can
imagine
that
some
folks
might
find
this
flavor
to
be
a
little
stringent
the
hops
get
stronger
as
the
flavors
spread
through
the
palate
then
in
comes
some
sweetness
and
a
little
bit
of
alcohol
finishes
pretty
dry
with
a
slight
biscuity
aftertaste
overall
a
very
smooth
mouthfeel
with
little
carbonation
presence
nice
now
this
beer
may
seem
not
too
drinkable
at
first
and
i
wasnt
able
to
test
out
my
theory
however
i
think
after
two
or
three
my
palate
would
adjust
quite
nicely
and
i
could
really
settle
into
a
good
session
drinkability
very
sessionable
be
a
nice
easy
drinking
lager
on
a
hot
day
d
while
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
epls
as
a
style
its
not
a
brain
surgeons
task
to
pick
out
the
ones
are
better
than
the
others
this
is
one
of
them
easy
thats
the
best
way
to
sum
it
up
this
beer
is
ok
in
my
book
heh
heh
sorry
i
couldnt
resist
just
too
easy
pours
a
brilliantly
clear

a
fizzy
white
two

head
passing
retention
but
little
to
no
lace
weak
saaz
aroma
with
background
pale
malt
and
a
hint
of
corn
or
dms
sweet
pale
malt
and
a
pinch
of
light
munich
malt
upfront
followed
by
a
mild
saaz
and
spicy
tettnanger
hop
flavor
drying
aftertaste
with
muted
hop
flavor
but
decently
balancing
bitterness
crisp
carbonation
and
lightish
body
borrowing
some
depth
of
character
and
texture
form
the
munich
malt
a
lively
and
zesty
mouthfeel
that
accentuates
the
timid
hop
acidity
finishes
clean
and
highly
drinkable
the
hop
character
is
surprisingly
subuded
but
this
still
has
a
great
flavor
and
is
a
credit
to
the
style
o
k
beer
pours
a
golden
yellow
with
a
fluffy
white
head
from
a
brown
500
ml
bottle
the
aroma
is
a
little
grainy
maybe
a
little
hoppy
the
malt
hits
first
followed
by
the
hops
its
not
bad
for
the
style
which
typically
doesnt
get
me
too
excited
in
the
first
place
worth
a
try
particularly
if
you
like
continental
lagers
especially
the
eastern
european
varieties
i
will
have
to
look
into
this
beer
a
little
more
in
the
summer
months
the
beer
pours
a
pale
gold
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
nice
pale
malt
scent
that
is
a
bit
sweet
it
also
has
a
grainy
feel
with
a
slighty
musty
aroma
the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
smooth
pale
malt
flavor
that
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
a
bit
dry
and
just
a
tad
musty
hops
are
present
but
low
in
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
lowmedium
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
good
drinking
beer
its
smooth
and
highly
quaffable

although
not

sharp
just
a

little
bite
a
better
than
average
pale
lager
to
be
had
maybe
a
newer
recipe
because
its
not
as
big
as
many
past
reviewers
stated
and
the
alc
is
lower

posteda
pretty
good

the

also
boasted
this
as

the

ok
pours
a
golden
color
with
pretty
good
head
has
a
very
nice
aroma
with
great
maltiness
and
a
touch
of
hops
the
taste
is
sweet
and
clean
with
a
bit
of
hops
for
a
clean
finish
mouthfeel
is
light
with
good
carbonation
but
is
pleasant
a
very
drinkable
lager
mouthfeel
is
the
saving
grace
of
this
beer
light
bodied
but
bigger
than
some
pale
lagers
strong
carbonation
that
lasts
through
the
swallow
is
very
lively
and
interesting
still
i
didnt
enjoy
this
beer
and
didnt
even
really
want
to
finish
my
portion
of
it
pale
golden
forming
a
nice
creamy
head
high
initial
carbonation
appetizing
smell
taste
is
rather
diappointing
on
the
sour
side
lots
of
hops
and
yeasts
but
their
balance
with
malts
is
obviously
improper
aftertaste
is
also
sour
typical
polish
lager
losing
points
to
czech
and
german
counterparts
mouthfeel
light
and
slick
the
carbonation
is
excellent
all
i
can
say
is
wow
what
a
perfect
allday
quaffer
for
the
summertime
when
a
bit
of
sharp
dry
european
flavor
is
on
your
agenda
i
will
be
aggressively
seeking
this
out
for
the
cooler
this
year
typical
simple
but
decent
stuff
from
the
north
side
of
the
tatras
my
expectations
were
exceeded
with
this
beer
the
nose
was
one
of
the
best
ive
experienced
for
this
style
of
beer
very
earthymalty
and
fresh
ill
revisit
this
lager
when
its
grilling
weather
im
sure
some
bbq
flesh
would
go
nice
with
this
this
one
pours
a
clear
yellowgold
color
with
a
brilliant
white
head
the
head
falls
pretty
quickly
but
leaves
a
small
laceproducing
ring
around
the
glass
the
smell
has
more
of
a
hop
character
than
i
expected
flowery
and
hoppy
with
a
pilslike
malt
foundation
just
a
touch
of
sweetness
in
the
taste
with
a
nice
hop
flavor
more
pilsner
malt
comes
forth
in
the
taste
than
the
aroma
i
have
to
admit
its
much
better
than
expected
and
certainly
better
than
just
okay
soft
and
rounded
body
which
leans
appropriately
to
the
lighter
side
hoppy
finish
although
a
little
more
bitterness
would
have
been
appreciated
this
is
a
nice
drinking
brew
and
i
think
would
make
a
decent
transition
beer
for
the
macro
crowd
d
ugh
this
is
not
an
ok
beer
this
is
a
pretty
terrible
beer
its
flavor
is
not
appetizing
at
all
i
will
never
have
this
again
i
could
not
bear
to
session
it
id
take
any
american
macro
lager
that
i
have
had
over
this
sure
this
has
more
flavor
but
more
isnt
always
a
good
thing
i
was
in
an
extreme
fit
of
masochism
able
to
finish
this
that
is
the
only
reason
it
is
scoring
this
high
in
drinkability
its
what
you
would
expect
from
the
style
to
be
honest
refreshing
and
fairly
easy
to
pull
down
just
nothing
to
crack
any
interest
some
will
say
its
great
sessioning
this
or
good
lawn
mower
type
beer
but
there
are
much
better
offerings
available
that
dont
come
from
across
the
pond
nothing
ill
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
again
but
i
wont
turn
one
down
if
handed
to
me
i
will
definately
be
buying
this
beer
again
and
it
comes
in
a
brown
bottle
praise
jesus
a
eurolager
in
a
brown
bottle
and
it
has
enough
alcohol
to
survive
the
trek
across
the
atlantic
praise
be
this
is
a
darn
good
pale
euro
lager
i
enjoyed
it
the
mouthfeel
is
average
and
the
drinkability
is
good
i
could
down
it
quickly
and
the
small
amount
of
flavor
it
does
have
is
enjoyable
o
k
beer
from
okocim
brewery
is
impressive
most
impressive
pours
a
beautiful
light
honey
color
havent
seen
a
pale
lager
with
such
nice
color
smells
a
bit
grassy
with
apple
taste
is
delicate
fruity
and
about
the
same
as
every
other
european
lager
sad
but
true
cant
knock
it
for
this
though
because
there
are
some
nice
subtle
flavors
here
very
drinkable
my
bottle
says
5
6
abv
worth
a
try
poured
a
vibrant
golden
straw
muted
aroma
a
bit
of
grain
flavor
was
bright
and
surprisingly
fresh
since
im
sure
it
took
a
while
for
this
beer
to
make
it
to
my
local
store
hopping
was
reserved
but
there
were
clear
czechbohemian
influences
some
smooth
grain
and
a
touch
of
grassyness
finished
not
bad
at
all
smooth
easy
drinking
and
pretty
inexpensive
for
a
quality
beer
tastes
light
and
citrusy
with
a
lot
of
lemon
coming
through
sweet
perhaps
a
nuttyness
to
it
a
lot
more
ok
than
i
thought
it
would
be
especially
for
two
dollars
mouthfeel
is
lightbodied
a
bit
watery
nothing
special
quite
drinkable
goes
down
easy
and
inexpensive
a
solid
beer
tried
this
after
reading
some
of
the
many
favorable
reviews
on
ba
poured
a
clear
bright
gold
with
a
white
foamy
head
not
much
lacing
at
all
slightly
grainy
nose
similar
to
american
lagers
but
more
prominant
and
much
less
skunk
like
taste
was
pleasant
somewhat
grainy
again
with
a
touch
of
lemon
a
little
bit
of
a
hop
kick
in
the
finish
overall
an
easy
drinking
light
bodied
brew
that
is
well
suited
to
the
weather
i
have
now
in
n
y
quite
typical
of
a
european
lager
in
that
it
looks
medium
straw
in
color
and
forms
an
dainty
white
head
that
laces
decently
it
smells
terribly
skunked
at
first
but
dispates
quickly
unlike
heineken
after
the
aroma
settles
it
becomes
watery
quicky
but
holds
its
malt
hop
balance
moderate
vegetal
and
buttery
tones
holds
fairly
creamy
mouthfeel
but
slick
aftertaste
is
crisp
and
lingers
with
mild
hop
bitterness
the
name
ironically
says
it
all
this
is
an
o
k
beer
no
more
no
less
drinkability
ok
for
a
euro
lager
note
that
the
abv
on
my
bottle
was
5
6
so
perhaps
the
abv
has
been
reduced
across
the
board
for
this
brew
has
that
grassy
wheat
corn
aroma
prevalent
in
many
european
lagers
with
a
slight
malt
sweetness
and
a
grainey
bitterness
slightly
bolder
than
its
american
counterparts
so
its
slightly
better
and
ranked
as
only
average
medium
golden
lager
with
an
average
white
head
and
lively
carbonation
and
a
short
watery
finish
short
be
able
to
finish
alot
whilst
working
in
the
yard
on
a
hot
summer
day
very
drinkable
unlike
with
american
pale
lagers
were
this
clean
smooth
and
flavorful
in
the
end
o
k
beer
is
okay
beer
its
a
big
fish
when
judged
against
its
peers
but
not
when
forced
to
swim
in
the
larger
ocean
of
craft
beer
i
understand
that
the
o
k
of
its
name
is
based
on
the
name
of
the
brewery
but
it
does
convey
a
certain
lack
of
self
assurance
and
may
be
something
of
a
selffulfilling
prophecy
or
i
could
be
spouting
a
bunch
of
absolute
nonsense
the
most
likely
theory
im
afraid
better
though
to
call
your
beer
absofuinlutely
fantastic
beer
and
take
your
chances
no
mouthfeel
thin
but
not
bad
generally
refreshing
and
it
tastes
pretty
good
right
now
overall
not
a
classic
but
it
is
a
decent
sessionlawnmowertype
beer
i
havent
had
this
one
in
a
long
while
perfect
session
brew
it
is
listed
here
as
6
2
but
my
bottle
says
5
6
when
98
percent
of
humans
think
of
a
perfect
beer
this
is
comes
to
mind
a
5l
bottle
pours
into
my
pint
glass
with
a
frothy
head
bringing
it
exactly
to
the
rim
it
has
a
golden
hue
with
a
little
bibt
of
orange
the
flavor
is
malty
with
hints
of
citrus
they
dont
cocme
more
drinkable
a
perfect
beer
to
throw
back
while
sitting
on
a
bar
stool
cheers
overall
tasty
stuff
much
better
than
i
expected
and
remembered
not
worth
what
i
paid
but
certainly
not
bad
drinkability
i
cant
see
how
anyone
could
call
this
something
other
than
perfect
realize
this
is
not
the
most
flavorful
complex
or
even
tasty
beer
around
but
it
has
an
awesome
ability
to
be
consumed
and
appreciated
for
what
it
is
a
european
export
lager
i
can
only
imagine
how
easy
this
is
to
drink
when
fresh
on
tap
super
easy
to
drink
amazing
fact
about
this
beer
its
6
2
abv
it
tastes
mid
4s
drink
with
caution
picked
this
one
up
out
of
pure
curiousity
no
freshness
or
best
before
dating
on
the
bottle
im
curious
to
the
age
pours
a
nice
golden
yellow
with
a
minimal
head
into
my
glass
faint
malty
aromas
invade
the
nose
first
taste
of
this
leaves
me
pleasantly
surprised
theres
a
nice
slightly
sweet
finish
to
this
beer
with
no
notes
of
alcohol
miniscule
notes
of
floral
hops
round
out
the
palate
mouthfeel
is
not
watery
thankfully
drinkability
is
super
high
on
this
one
i
had
no
clue
of
the
6
2
abv
this
was
a
decent
pickup
these
kind
of
lagers
will
probably
never
be
my
favorite
but
i
could
easily
convince
some
of
my
macro
drinking
friends
to
pick
up
a
few
500
mls
of
these
this
is
a
good
lager
pale
and
clear
like
most
its
cleanwith
a
big
malty
profile
a
modest
dose
of
hops
and
the
slightest
alcohol
whiff
clean
and
smooth
throughout
its
simple
and
does
nothing
amazing
but
everything
good
a
more
than
easy
to
drink
crisp
beer
ill
have
any
day
of
the
week
good
stuff
well
being
polish
myself
i
could
get
quite
a
bit
of
polish
brews
so
slowly
ill
try
to
review
as
much
as
possible
however
ive
never
had
the
o
k
beer
and
i
quite
like
it
pours
out
a
pale
yellow
with
a
decent
enough
head
on
it
smell
consisted
of
malts
and
grains
some
hops
at
a
distant
though
taste
was
nice
malts
upfront
with
some
grain
and
some
spicy
hops
towards
the
end
its
nicely
done
for
a
6
2
beer
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
too
thin
though
but
other
than
that
it
was
a
good
brew
gotta
like
the
crest
with
the
goat
trying
to
pick
up
and
drink
the
beer
i
was
impressed
with
this
polish
lager
and
would
keep
a
few
around
if
i
didnt
have
to
drive
three
hours
to
find
it
this
would
be
an
excellent
session
lager
copper
color
with
a
head
that
leaves
a
layer
on
top
after
it
fades
from
a
moderate
white
head
on
the
pour
not
a
very
strong
scent
a
light
euro
lager
scent
taste
is
big
and
malty
with
the
alcohol
melding
nicely
with
the
flavor
one
of
my
favorite
euro
lagers
so
far
i
would
get
this
again
very
solid
very
drinkable
didnt
know
that
poland
made
good
beer
i
will
buy
this
again
pale
golden
color
with
nice
frothy
white
head
nice
consistent
lacing
along
the
glass
and
a
balanced
aroma
of
hops
and
malt
significantly
hoppier
taste
slightly
salty
brisk
and
refreshing
mouthfeel
though
a
bit
smoother
than
its
american
brothers
brings
to
mind
fond
memories
of
brick
oven
pizza
it
really
is
an
unassuming
lager
it
doesnt
do
anything
spectacular
but
doesnt
screw
anything
up
either
i
really
think
that
this
is
the
standardbearer
based
on
availability
here
in
the
us
nicely
done
okocim
for
you
viking
pilsener
fans
like
aass
bad
grolsch
baked
bitburger
etc
this
is
your
beer
chewy
pils
here
high
in
alcohol
i
think
at
least
thats
how
it
seems
after
basting
my
palate
with
it
scented
of
steamed
roots
herbs
and
mustard
it
wanders
across
the
palate
with
bitter
green
woody
tannins
and
glazed
tropical
fruit
humongous
lager
overreaching
stern
and
violently
bitter
on
the
finish
it
is
not
a
stoopid
beer
instead
it
is
branfrax
threatening
but
satisfying
filtered
probably
pasteurized
dont
knowe
pours
a
pale
golden
color
with
an
agressive
head
that
stays
for
a
long
time
smells
of
grass
and
not
much
else
taste
is
rather
average
in
my
opinoin
nothing
to
write
home
about
malt
breadiness
is
the
main
flavor
and
herbal
hops
are
there
to
balance
it
out
but
the
flavors
are
very
subdued
i
cant
believe
this
is
6
2
abv
because
i
dont
detect
any
alcohol
presence
finish
makes
me
forget
that
i
am
even
drinking
beer
overall
this
is
a
well
crafted
balanced
beer
that
lacks
the
bite
to
truly
be
a
good
beer
in
my
opinoin
this
is
easy
to
drink
and
pretty
smooth
needs
a
little
more
flavor
to
be
more
than
ok
this
is
the
beer
that
made
me
fall
in
love
with
polish
lagers
when
i
first
had
it
on
tap
tonight
i
sample
the
bottled
version
pours
an
incredible
head
that
fills
the
glass
and
sticks
to
it
all
the
way
down
color
is
a
very
pale
and
very
clear
gold
the
nose
is
sweet
with
a
mild
spicyness
taste
is
typical
to
the
style
which
is
dominated
by
the
sweet
malts
not
much
in
the
way
of
hops
here
except
maybe
in
the
aftertaste
i
could
drink
several
of
these
in
a
sitting
without
stopping
to
think
twice
about
it
a
fine
light
polish
lager
color
is
a
light
to
medium
golden
yellow
poured
with
a
very
large
head
crystal
clear
this
one
smelled
a
bit
skunky
but
not
too
bad
flavor
is
a
bit
watery
its
an
ok
pilsner
but
it
has
much
more
potential
dry
finish
with
some
bitter
aftertaste
not
much
alcohol
taste
despite
the
fact
its
6
2abv
according
to
the
label
this
one
is
has
a
better
than
average
drinkability
since
there
is
not
much
to
think
about
its
a
stright
forward
clean
crisp
pilsner
nothing
complex
better
than
an
american
macro
similar
in
taste
to
a
canadian
macro
would
go
great
at
the
ballgame
with
a
hot
dog
a
good
example
of
a
european
pilsner
good
not
great
this
is
a
very
good
lagerpilsner
stronger
and
creamier
than
what
is
typical
for
the
style
pours
a
nice
golden
hue
with
a
creamy
head
that
remains
malt
and
hops
are
evident
no
trace
of
the
extra
alcohol
the
taste
is
discernably
different
has
an
almost
salty
character
not
quite
as
refreshing
as
my
favorite
pilsners
but
creamier
and
more
of
a
kick
if
you
see
it
give
it
a
try
a
nice
alternative
interesting
brew
just
a
shade
on
the
amber
side
of
gold
i
didnt
get
much
head
retention
intriguing
brassy
aroma
of
light
caramel
maltiness
and
forceful
medicinal
hops
flavor
profile
contains
white
bread
mint
and
a
subtle
smokiness
finish
is
very
dry
and
crisp
with
a
metallic
twang
that
i
would
say
is
the
only
offputting
feature
unusual
herbal
minty
medicinal
hops
give
this
beer
a
twist
from
the
ordinary
fizzy
yellow
lager
some
may
think
this
is
a
poor
purpose
for
a
beer
and
they
would
not
be
accurate
but
this
would
make
an
excellent
palate
cleanser
easy
to
drink
and
alcohol
is
nestled
unobtrusively
in
the
malt
flavor
on
the
pour
a
cloudless
gold
or
straw
color
if
your
so
inclined
the
head
impressive
in
size
and
frothy
in
its
consistency
the
lace
fair
sheets
to
cover
the
glass
malt
dominated
nose
that
is
also
crisp
and
clean
refreshing
also
comes
to
mind
start
is
sweet
and
the
top
lean
in
feel
the
finish
is
spitefully
acidic
with
a
middling
hop
presence
and
a
droughty
lingering
aftertaste
average
and
drinkable
which
is
good
enough
i
guess
this
was
the
last
remaining
bottle
of
my
recent
score
of
polish
pilsners
and
im
glad
i
saved
it
for
last
pale
straw
in
color
with
a
thin
bubbly
head
aroma
is
very
mild
with
slight
grainy
notes
and
a
hint
of
hops
the
taste
starts
off
with
a
pleasant
slightly
citric
hop
flavor
undergirded
by
a
light
malty
sweetness
malt
picks
up
a
little
midpalate
accompanied
by
a
moderate
warming
taste
of
alcohol
and
is
finished
with
a
somewhat
unusual
and
astringent
hop
bitterness
very
wellcarbonated
and
light
in
the
mouth
best
cold
but
definitely
one
of
the
better
pilsners
presently
produced
by
the
fatherland
na
zdrowie
boston
area
i
can
get
it
for
less
than
2
a
500
ml
bottle
a
six
pack
of
the
stuff
in
nyc
is
about
12
needless
to
say
i
like
buying
it
in
beantown
perky
white
lace
and
a
good
golden
clarity
clean
aroma
with
a
whiff
of
hops
and
sweet
malt
superb
crispness
with
a
dry
malt
character
that
brings
a
bready
flavour
to
the
palate
clean
in
the
mouth
with
a
quick
snappy
bite
of
hops
that
linger
into
the
after
taste
one
of
my
favourite
euro
lagers
notes
a
most
interesting
and
strong
lager
the
unique
hop
profile
might
take
certain
drinkers
some
getting
used
to
i
really
liked
this
beer
like
a
bad
macro
beer
but
from
poland
straw
and
grainy
aroma
golden
pale

with
a
thin

malty

beer
not
bad
i
could
drink
a
few
basic
european
supermarketindustry
beer
not
bad
just
a
default
simple
blonde
beer
i
dunno
something
in
this
one
has
always
given
me
a
headache
tried
it
about
6
times
over
the
years
in
bottles
and
cans
definitely
not
a
beer
that
i
would
recommand
alström
review
is
totally
accurate
ab
ab
ab
ab
ab
not
my
favorite
it
was
an
okay
beer
when
your
in
the
mood
for
a
european
beer
try
this
it
strikes
me
that
this
is
polands
answer
to
budweiser
or
mgd
in
fact
it
shares
many
of
the
same
characteristics
there
is
nothing
terrible
here
but
nothing
special
it
is
a
very
typical
euro
lager
there
is
less
skunk
in
the
nose
than
some
euros
but
everything
else
is
pretty
much
what
one
would
expect
from
this
style
pours
a
golden
yellow
very
clear
very
little
head
even
after
an
aggressive
pour
head
faded
to
nothing
after
about
30
seconds
no
lacing
aroma
was
pretty
weak
with
some
ver
slight
grainy
malt
notes
no
hop
or
bitter
notes
in
the
smell
taste
was
sweet
malt
and
corn
with
just
a
touch
of
bitterness
not
much
else
as
it
warmed
i
got
a
bit
of
a
metallic
taste
not
good
the
mouthfeel
was
light
and
crisp
but
nothing
special
overall
this
ones
not
among
the
better
beers
out
there
probably
wont
buy
it
again
i
like
this
beer
it
has
a
little
bitter
taste
it
was
pretty
cheap
at
cosco
24

of
16
9

this
is
a
winner
better
than
domestic
adjunct
cornrice
for
about
the
same
price
it
seams
heavier
than
most
common
imports
and
still
has
a
high
alcohol

focused
and
rich
tastes
like
sweetened
chamomile
iced
tea
light
gold
in

the
aroma
is
of
grains
malts
and
hops
with
a
hint
of
citrus
zest
pretty
much
the
same
for
the
taste
does
have
a
slight
bitter
finish

very

to
drink
a
pleasant
and
enjoyable
offering
interesting
packaging
and
design
of
the
bottle
although
i
found
the
taste
to
be
just
average
since
it
was
moderately
priced
and
a
rare
find
here
in
melbourne
i
bought
it
out
of
curiosity
will
try
to
find
the
porter
next
time
which
seems
to
be
more
popular
overall
its
not
a
bad
beer
it
does
feel
a
tad
generic
but
its
something
i
could
definitely
drink
i
would
take
zyweic
over
heineken
amstel
stella
etc
not
only
because
it
overall
i
feel
is
a
better
beer
but
also
since
it
is
much
cheaper
my
mark
out
of
a
hundred
would
be
75
overall
meh
overall
kind
of
feels
like
a
big
macro
lager
with
the
heavy
accents
of
grain
and
corn
final
thoughts
this
is
the
kinda
beer
that
makes
people
flock
to
macro
lagers
as
i
can
see
someone
trying
it
and
not
ever
wanting
to
try
import
beer
again
its
not
very
smooth
not
very
flavorful
and
all
around
not
very
good
it
got
the
drain
a
little
bit
over
the
half
way
point
so
youll
definitely
want
to
pass
on
this
one
o
not
bad
but
not
worth
seeking
out
o
drink
it
cold
and
its
an
average
epl
letting
it
warm
shows
you
its
inner
demons
do
not
let
it
warm
easy
to
drink
and
refreshing
i
drank
about
400
of
these
during
a
recent
trip
to
poland
very
standard
lager
but
very
refreshing
especially
when
fresh
not
at
all
surprising
to
say
it
was
way
better
there
than
the
imported
bottles
ive
had
in
the
states
most
polish
lagers
seem
to
take
on
a
gasoline
aroma
when
they
warm
up
but
zywiecs
flavor
held
nice
light
malt
character
and
really
drinkable
its
not
bad
beer
it
just
isnt
good
beer
a
bubbly
consistent
white
head
with
a
very
bright
very
clear
straw
colour
faint
earthy
hop
aroma
mouthfeel
is
full
and
dry
mediumcarbonated
taste
is
very
light
and
crisp
with
delicious
and
subtle
hints
of
corn
green
apple
hop
and
malt
a
great
balance
vague
acidity
and
a
touch
of
metalicness
but
overall
an
extremely
satisfying
pale
lager
experience
the
body
is
very
light
and
its
crisp
almost
smooth
but
for
a
slickness
that
carries
through
and
tries
to
transition
to
a
sort
of
smoothness
with
little
effect
o
just
another
pale
lager
nothing
really
stands
out
could
probably
down
a
large
number
of
these
but
i
wouldnt
really
enjoy
it
its
alright
if
you
like
the
light
stuff
here
it
is
overall
pretty
good
but
certainly
nothing
terrific
good
easy
drinking
lightish
beer
o
not
very
pleasant
tasting
and
a
little
boring
in
the
flavour
department
one
to
try
but
maybe
not
to
buy
again

this
beer
files
in
behind
many
better
more
engaging
lagers
what
can
i
say
i
like
my
beer
i
had
this
one
for
the
first
time
on
a
whim
the
other
day
and
was
pleasantly
surprised
after
the
first
taste
out
of
the
bottle
i
had
to
pour
it
to
see
what
was
hiding
in
the
bottle
my
wife
who
generally
likes
pale
ales
said
she
liked
it
after
the
first
sip
she
asked
me
what
it
was
well
i
said
it
looks
like
a
honey
ale
but
has
an
aftertaste
like
a
lager
very
nice
over
all
and
at
least
as
good
as
fisher
and
three
of
that
of
peroni
without
the
price
overall
not
a
bad
brew
but
nothing
too
exceptional
it
is
rather
easy
drinking
and
refreshing
but
lacks
much
complexity
and
is
fairly
simple
overall
zywiec
geeveeettes
pours
a
crisp
golden
color
and
omits
a
citrusy
lemon
zest
aroma
the
beer
itself
has
a
cereal
grain
taste
with
a
medium
to
thin
body
and
has
a
medium
bitterness
as
well
moderate
amounts
of
noble
hops
in
the
flavor
profile
give
this
beer
a
little
bit
of
a
spiciness
the
beer
finishes
dry
and
moderately
bitter
got
the
beer
as
a
gift
from
good
friends
one
of
which
is
from
poland
thus
i
do
not
know
how
to
rate
this
beer
by
price
for
what
it
is
it
is
good
but
not
normally
my
style
very
light
colored
lager
with
obvious
carbonation
crisp
taste
without
any
depth
could
might
as
well
say
zywiec
light
crisp
initial
taste
tails
off
and
is
replaced
by
a
lighter
flavor
and
carbonation
could
work
well
in
a
summer
situation
as
a
refresher
clean
dry
crisp
finish
probably
wouldnt
recommned
this
one
to
anyone
nazdrowia
thats
how
you
say
cheers
in
poland
this
is
the
polish
equivalent
of
a
bud
or
molson
canadian
and
it
can
be
found
in
every
bar
in
every
city
in
every
disko
right
across
poland
living
there
and
being
a
young
guy
i
was
naturally
drawn
to
the
social
aspect
of
this
beer
everyone
was
drinking
it
between
shots
of
wodka
this
was
pretty
good
stuff
the
women
usually
got
a
couple
of
pumps
of
raspberry
syrup
and
drank
it
from
a
straw
weird
not
really
my
thing
until
i
discovered
tyskie
and
okocim
this
was
my
gotohave
a
fun
timeparty
beer
it
pours
an
average
light
yellow
smells
pretty
blah
and
isnt
really
something
worthy
of
writing
a
long
review
about
so
i
leave
you
with
this
when
in
poland
drink
what
the
polish
drink
and
that
is
zywiec
żywiec
the
bottle
says
polands
no
1
beer
osurprisingly
tasty
for
a
macrobrew
way
more
character
than
most
domestic
american
offerings
a
pretty
boring
very
average
beer
nothing
bad
but
nothing
to
get
excited
about
light
body
but
denser
than
pilsners
the
5
6
alcohol
is
perceived
more
than
usual
regular
beer
an
okay
lager
that
didnt
quite
live
up
to
my
expectations
based
on
appearance
and
smell
still
its
light
refreshing
and
easy
drinking
pours
a
clear
yellow
with
a
foamy
beige
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small

on

down
smell
is
of
malt
grain
and
a
slight
skunky
aroma
taste
is
of
malt
grass
and
a
slightly
fruity
flavor
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
average
beer
that
is
drinkable
but
nothing
special
for
the
style
clean
as
most
central
european
pale
lagers
tend
to
be
and
perhaps
a
bit
boring
this
has
a
light
crisp
aroma
its
not
a
big
grassy
hop
aromafar
from
it
but
its
definitely
fresh
and
vibrant
for
being
what
it
is
flavor
is
decent
decently
fresh
decently
crisp
decentlywell
decent
like
a
macrobrew
with
actual
hints
of
flavor
finish
is
crisp
with
a
touch
of
honeyed
sweetness
and
an
easysipping
effervescence
that
makes
me
think
id
try
this
again
sometime
nothing
stands
out
but
it
wasnt
offensive
to
the
palate
in
the
least
had
this
one
on
tap
at
a
polish
festival
in
omaha
and
man
did
i
enjoy
it
it
was
a
hot
day
and
the
beer
couldnt
have
been
any
fresher
i
bought
a
glass
and
the
head
curled
up
along
the
top
and
dripped
down
the
outside
perfectly
my
first
smell
i
noticed
more
hops
and
character
than
im
used
to
having
in
a
euro
pale
lager
this
beer
was
balanced
and
rich
in
flavors
but
refreshing
and
delicious
no
skunk
either
i
may
make
this
my
go
to
epl
overall
not
something
i
would
seek
out
again
kind
of
terrible
actually
overall
good
for
the
price
500ml
for
au4
for
one
bottle
not
for
the
case
etc
pretty
good
value
cant
get
it
much
better
for
that
price
overall
pretty
nice
tasting
beer
that
falls
short
in
the
more
subjective
areas
odthis
went
down
very
nicely
at
a
barbeque
not
as
poorly
produced
as
many
other
euro
lagers
i
enjoyed
it
to
a
certain
extent
didnt
realize
that
it
was
5
6
percent
alcohol
doesnt
really
taste
that
strong
just
noticed
it
on
the
bottle
d
im
assuming
this
bottle
is
a
bit
past
its
prime
but
even
then
i
dont
think
this
would
have
been
anything
spectacular
when
fresh
o
a
typical
macro
mainstream
beer
for
those
who
care
more
for
buzz
in
relation
to
the
cost
rather
than
high
quality
overall
this
is
a
boring
beer
this
beer
is
awesome
from
the
tap
in
poland
funny
though
when
i
bought
a
six
pack
in
the
us
it
was
not
as
good
i
love
the
taste
and
like
many
other
beers
in
the
area
it
has
that
common
european
taste
to
it
this
beer
is
a
lower
hopped
beer
with
just
the
right
amount
to
let
you
know
youre
drinking
beer
but
yet
not
all
overwhelming
look
for
this
beer
on
tap
when
in
poland
and
enjoy
also
ask
the
bartender
the
proper
way
to
pronounce
the
name
its
tricky
to
say
correctly
overall
an
everyday
beer
that
you
shouldnt
runaway
from
a
notch
sweet
but
creamy

1
beer
but
its
heading
down
the
drain
the
most
common
beer
from
poland
available
in
the
states
has
some
aspects
that
make
it
a
very
drinkable
beer
poured
into
a
pilsner
glass
the
beer
was
a
pale
yellow
with
a
half
inch
head
there
was
a
mild
earthy
aroma
that
lends
nothing
to
the
beer
the
taste
is
surprising
a
sweet
fruity
flavor
with
hints
of
banana
and
sweet
bread
is
present
this
yields
to
a
sour
fruit
aftertaste
that
stays
in
the
mouth
well
after
the
swallow
the
beer
is
quite
flat
lacking
any
distinct
carbonation
however
it
goes
down
quite
smooth
with
a
slightly
higher
abv
than
most
macros
good
for
days
when
you
know
you
will
drink
more
than
you
should
appearance
is
gold
with
a
nice
aray
of
white
foam
smell
is
typical
of
the
euro
brews
lacks
hops
in

mouthfeel
is

lingering

in

for

period
taste
is
ok
for
this
euro
pale
lager
reminds
us
of
all
those
other
euro
lagers
drinkable
but
not
something
we
will
run
out
a
buy
overall
we
will
not
turn
this
beer
down
but
we
will
not
go
out
seeking
this
one
give
us
some
peanuts
with
this
beer
o
obvious
11
years
has
done
good
for
this
brew
but
by
looking
at
the
other
review
it
didnt
hurt
it
either
o
a
good
example
of
epa
an
ok
all
around
beer
light
on
flavor
and
a
bit
more
fruity
than
i
like
my
lagers
to
be

with

overall
your
typical

brew
light
on

flavor
but
drinkable
barely
overall
a
nice
drinkable
beer
that
would
work
well
with
the
warmer
weather
nothing
groundbreaking
but
also
not
offensive
i
wouldnt
rush
out
to
get
it
again
but
im
happy
o
have
tried
pair
with
doritos
not
a
brilliant
beer
by
any
standard
too
many
unpleasant
offnotes
lurking
in
the
background
if
youre
gonna
drink
it
i
recommend
keeping
it
ice
cold
after
two
sips
i
am
looking
to
wash
my
mouth
out
drink
its
a
free
beer
so
cant
complain
euro
all
day
long
d
this
is
a
pretty
standard
eastern
european
lager
nothing
special
food
match
polish
food
seems
too
exciting
a
food
match
for
this
im
going
to
recommend
a
bowl
of
soup
cream
of
celery
with
a
crusty
but
make
sure
its
plain
bread
roll
sorted
o
one
of
my
favorite
polish
beers
great
to
kick
back
a
few
of
these
and
relax
with
some
friends
i
guess
this
brew
is
a
cut
above
some
of
the
other
polishukrainianbaltic
massmarket
lagers
but
that
isnt
really
saying
much
o
a
drinkable
lager
but
certainly
nothing
to
seek
out
i
can
not
imagine
someone
preferring
this
style
over
all
others
od
i
couldnt
session
this
but
it
is
drinkable
as
a
lager
doesnt
taste
great
but
much
better
than
others
available
in
those
parts
this
was
fresh
and
domestic
ive
never
tried
it
at
home
but
i
dont
imagine
travel
would
be
kind
to
it
o
a
standard
polish
lager
average
in
most
aspects
it
would
mix
well
with
traditional
polish
bread
and
cabbagebased
dishes
o
fairly
drinkable
bitterness
is
more
than
expected
typical
pale
lager
i
tried
throughout
eastern
europe
o
for
1
99
bomber
its
ok
but
there
is
a
lot
better
out
there
and
this
one
will
be
passed
on
in
the
future
oreminds
me
of
a
european
version
of
bud
very
drinkable
but
thats
because
it
lacks
flavor
and
body
fairly
close
to
the
style
but
still
not
alot
going
on
in
this
beer
overall
not
my

was
very
light
corn
grain
bread
sort
of
a

again
pretty
run
of

for

the
taste
was

and
clean
classic
lager
grainy
malted
taste
slight
hint
at
the
european
hops
very
smooth
and
a
classic
session
beer
overall
it
was
ok
a
top
macro
lager
if
that
seems
like
a
backhanded
compliment
it
is
notes
its
not
too
bad
not
anything
to
write
home
about
but
it
could
come
in
handy
on
a
hot
spring
or
summer
day
cheers
this
is
beer
at
its
most
basic
its
good
for
summer
when
you
just
want
to
drink
a
beer
to
quench
your
thirst
without
giving
it

pours
a
rather
clear
semicopper
color
with
a
rather
thick
head
of
foam
scent
is
mostly
of
malts
and
its
not
a
very
good
scent
either
as
it
sort
of
reminds
me
of
vomit
sadly
enough
there
is
a
ver
fine
and
thin
taste
to
it
semisweet
malts
and
a
touch
of
almounds
is
what
i
pick
out
still
very
drinkable
but
too
thin
and
watery
for
my
liking
pours
a
light
golden
color
with
a
thin
soapy
white
head
which
recedces
to
no
lacing
and
no
real
head
the
aroma
was
of
grains
and
some
bland
malts
the
taste
had
a
grainy
and
corn
backbone
but
then
there
was
a
nice
sweet
undertone
from
the
middle
to
the
back
end
a
slight
hop
bite
but
hard
to
find
the
mouthfeel
was
heavily
carbonated
overall
it
was
an
above
average
euro
the
sweetness
makes
it
stand
out
a
little
bit
from
the
others
a
decent
lager
accompanied
an
excellent
hunters
stew
at
a
local
polish
restaurant
crisp
bite
nice
combination
of
malt
and
hops
but
would
have
liked
it
to
be
a
bit
hoppier
fruity
undertones
fairly
strong
carbonation
nice
dry
finish
hazy
gold
with
a
fluffy
white
head
that
held
on
for
a
good
bit
probably
served
a
bit
too
cold
so
i
let
it
sit
for
a
while
easy
drinking
and
complimented
the
hearty
stew
nicely
if
im
back
at
this
place
ill
have
another
i
may
however
ask
them
to
serve
it
in
something
other
than
a
stella
glass
o
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
but
theres
nothing
interesting
enough
in
this
that
would
make
me
want
to
try
this
again

not

last

for

poured
out
into
a
small
cup
that
was
given
out
upon
entry
the
beer
poured
out
as
a
pale
yellow
nothing
overly
exciting
there
the
aroma
was
a
little
skunky
flavor
was
on
the
bitter
side
also
a
little
light
nothing
made
a
major
impact
on
me
from
this
beer
i
probably
wont
be
seeking
this
one
out
anytime
soon
o
a
foreign
bmc
not
a
bad

not
something
i
would

drinkability
is
high
because
there
is
not

much
going

here
even
for

i
rather
have
a
nice
apa
since
there
is
way
more
flavor
in
a
beer
like
alpha
king
but
im
a
hop
head
so
what
do
you
expect
this
beer
is
simply
boring
and
just
like
any
other
boring
macro
lager
but
more
expensive
d
very
sessionable
just
not
much
taste
here
i
wouldnt
pick
this
up
if
i
saw
it
stick
with
sam
smith
if
youre
looking
for
a
good
euro
lager
overall
a
nonoffensive
but
unmemorable
beer
d
was

its
pretty

fairly

overall
a
decent
lager
which
is
very
easy
to
drink
but
doesnt
have
a
whole
lot
to
it
you
could
do
worse
wanted
to
try
a
polish
beer
d
easily
drinkable
but
a
fairly
average
offering
and
i
wouldnt
purchase
it
again
oddly
enough
i
found
it
to
be
similar
to
heineken
and
found
it
humerous
that
they
were
a
subsidiary
of
the
aforementioned
brewery
poured

i
had

i

it
was
a

i

almost
any

d
disgusting

in

i
tried

one
bottle
never

again
d
this
beer
is
nice
and
clean
in
the
aroma
with
a
good
hint
of
grain
the
carbonic
acid
is
just
to
big
and
bitey
but
it
does
scrub
away
much
of
the
flavor
it
would
be
nice
on
a
very
hot

but
i
would
prefer
more
grain
flavor
and
less

to
show

the
dark
caramel
aspects
give
a
heavier
feel
that
seems
out
of
place
id
like
it
better
if
it
were
more
crisp
and
light
carbonation
was
very
rigorous
after
the
pour
but
soon
settled
to
an
appropriate
level
overall
there
are
a
few
things
i
dont
like
about
it
would
reach
for
a
zywiec
over
an

333333its
worth
a
shot
but
its
not
enough
to
redeem
this
lager
as
something
i
would
regularly
drinkbuy
it
does
its
job
at
5
5
abv
and
although
you
would
think
this
would
make
one
think
that
its
a
great
session
beer
id
say
reconsider
and
try
some
other
eastern
eurolagers
before
diving
into
this
one
as
your
first
choice
its
passable
as
a
decent
ee
l
beer
but
only
barely
poured
crystal
clear
blonde
with
a
modest
head
that
quickly
reduced
to
a
collar
and
eventually
nothing
the
aroma
is
pretty
quiet
not
a
lot
going
on
the
taste
is
sweet
i
can
not
find
any
bitterness
feel
is
light
bodied
with
very
little
carbonation
drinkability
you
should
be
able
to
drink
a
lot
of
these
and
under
certain
circumstances
probably
would
as
you
can
tell
from
the
review
the
one
remarkable
characteristic
of
this
beer
is
bland
at
1
99
for
a
500
ml
bottle
the
price
was
right
though
d
not
the
best
not
the
worst
kind
of
boring
after
one
or
two
im
looking
for
what
else
is
around
nothing
offensive
here
but
nothing
exciting
either
the
high
point
is
the
nice
light
golden
color
and
the
light
bubble
column
of
bubble
slight
bitter
on
the
finish
a
little
steeley
very
drinkable
faint
green
apple
grassy
on
the
nose
would
be
nice
on
a
scortching
hot
day
a
crisp
body
i
could
have
another
i
suppose
drinkability
is
slightly
lower
as
the
abv
is
higher
and
although
the
taste
is
pleasantly
unusual
its
not
something
id
want
all
the
time
a
euro
pale
lager
made
in
poland
and
imported
by
heineken
what
do
you
expect
and
yet
it
was
a
bit
better
than
anticipated
served
cold
poured
frothy
yellow
in
the
glass
with
a
decent
head
and
a
bit
of
skunk
despite
the
brown
bottle
but
some
malt
in
the
nose
taste
was
both
a
touch
sweet
a
bit
biscuity
and
somewhat
balanced
with
fruity
hops
though
far
less
than
one
might
expect
very
easy
drinking
beeralmost
too
much
so
you
could
put
down
a
few
of
these
on
a
cold
night
in
warsaw
or
warshington
handdelivered
by
uf
from
pittsburgh
thanks
uf
drinkability
yes
very
but
not
in
a
good
way
just
not
a
lot
of
flavor

take

ah
ok
a
good
drink
not
great
could
easily
drink
a
handful
of
these
i
will
go
get
another
and
enjoy
this
day
i
could
have
put
back
a
few
of
these
very
drinkable
great
summer
beer
zywiec
beer
is
everything
i
thought
it
would
be
very
average
come
to
think
of
it
it
might
be
slightly
better
than
i
expected
i
didnt
have
high
hopes
its
biggest
flaw
is
that
it
lacks
any
real
flavor
or
character
i
suppose
its
worth
a
try
generally
its
tough
to
find
a
euro
pale
thats
worth
a
damn
this
ones
run
of
the
mill
for
the
style
but
im
sure
theres
worse
pours
clear
gold
with
a
modest
white
head
the
head
recedes
to
a
white
ring
some
minor
lacings
aroma
is
grassy
taste
is
mildly
bitter
hops
with
a
sweet
malt
component
well
balanced
and
easy
drinking
carbonation
is
just
enough
a
mildly
dry
bitter
finish
a
very
non
descript
beer
for
the
most
part
it
would
make
an
awesome
session
beer
a
soso
eurolager
the
sweetness
a
bit
much
at
times
but
the
graininess
does
have
its
charm
especially
when
enjoyed
in
quantity
with
friends
of
polish
extraction
who
will
hear
no
such
criticism
d
just
about
the
most
safe
and
inoffensive
beer
ive
had
in
months
its
light
in
flavor
and
body
and
goes
down
easy
keep
it
cold
to
fend
off
the
odd
metallic
finish
a
hard
beer
to
judge
as
its
a
well
made
example
of
this
style
but
oh
so
boring
to
drink
d
drinks
pretty
easily
at
first
swift
you
get
a
hint
of
skunk
weed
giving
it
any
points
this
beer
has
to
save
itself
it
has
a
great
heavy
feel
of
grains
followed
with
a
great
consistent
clear
body
and
proper
amount
of
lacing
better
than
most
large
capacity
american
lager
it
does
have
some
appeal
when
compared
to
bud
coors
millers
and
pbr
it
wasnt
awful
drinkability
its
a
very
smooth
european
lager
but
its
nothing
special
its
much
more
of
a
drinking
beer
than
an
enjoying
beer
does
that
even
make
sense
didnt
arouse
my
spidey
senses
but
much
respect
to
the
offering
from
the
mother
country
the
new
beer
thermometer
on
the
back
cracks
me
up
overall
while
im
happy
with
it
and
could
drink
more
of
it
it
is
not
a
beer
that
i
will
seek
out
in
the
future
back
to
the
beer
i
found
it
to
be
an
above
average
macro
import
it
was
very
smooth
and
crisp
even
moreso
than
most
of
the
imported
stuff
has
a
decent
abv
of
5
7
but
it
was
very
drinkable
and
went
great
with
pizza
sure
its
nothing
spectacular
but
id
have
it
again
for
sure
overall
nothing
offensive
nor
spectacular
perhaps
this
is
just
a
bit
better
than
all
of
the
other
macro
euro
lagers
out
there

doesnt
come
close
to
its
porter
cousin
it
has
a
golden
clear
body
with
a

of
carbonation
in
the
middle
the
head
is
thick
and
bubbly
with
light
lace
it
has
very
crisp
aroma
with
some
mild
hops
it
has
more
hops
than
malt
and
is
also
very
clean
in
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
lightly
carbonated
it
is
easy
to
drink
fast
or
sip
and
is
very
refreshing
dsmooth
going
down
maybe
not
so
much
as
it
warms
scared
of
a
hangover
from
this
stuff
d
since
it
is
not
wild
or
intense
you
are
able
to
drink
it
repeatedly
the
flavour
is
good
and
wont
get
on
your
nerves
if
drinking
a
considerable
amount
it
also
helps
if
you
are
in
poland
buying
it
on
tap
at
a
bar
where
it
will
run
your
roughly
2
a

easy

i
had
in

when
i

definitely
different
from
its
domestic
counterpart
i
was
hoping
to
be
transported
back
to
the
krakow
student
bars
but
i
was
unsurprisingly
disappointed
still
its
crisp
light
refreshing
and
very
drinkable
i
just
dont
know
if
id
pay
212oz
for
this
over
a
cheaper
american
lager
na

a
decent
frothy

that

on

no

although
the
bitterness
of
the

is
nice
and
prominent
which
i
find
interesting
and
enjoyable
but
not
enough
to
overcome
broad
shortcomings
on
all

of

its

to

makes

serves
me
well
it
reminds
me
of
a

pull

its
a
little
skunky
and
pilsnerlike
fairly
drinkable

lager
more
flavorful
and
more

than
your

dont
usually
like

to

anything

slainte
i
tried
this
beer
on
march
12
2008
after
purchasing
from
one
of
my
local
lcboi
outlets
the
beer
poured
a
nice
translucent
gold
colour
with
a
minimal
white
head
the
aroma
was
mainly
grainy
malts
with
nothing
else
the
mouthfeel
mwas
medium
bodied
with
ample
carbonation
the
flavour
was
similar
to
the
aroma
in
that
it
was
very
malty
with
very
little
other
discernable
flavours
this
beer
is
readily
available
in
canada
but
is
simply
an
average
brew
at
best
not
something
i
would
consider
buying
again
i
believe
this
is
the
first
and
only
polish
brew
i
have
had
i
could
never
pronounce
the
name
correctly
until
i
actually
asked
a
polish
couple
for
those
who
are
unsure
it
is
ziveeic
unfortunately
it
wasnt
too
impressive
probably
considered
the
budweiser
of
poland
i
had
it
well
chilled
in
a
pint
glass
poured
a
bright
yellow
color
with
a
decent
white
head
smell
was
faint
with
some
grassy
hops
and
mild
malt
sweetness
taste
was
thin
with
a
little
balance
of
malt
and
hops
it
is
pretty
easy
drinking
but
that
is
all
it
has
for
itself
yellow
golden
light
straw
actually
with
a
fine
puffy
white
head
aromas
of
sweet
grains
faint
sulfur
and
a
touch
of
metal
what
can
i
say
the
flavor
is
very
much
the
same
with
a
neutral
balance
of
malt
v
hops
the
mouth
feel
is
just
below
medium
and
it
has
a
sweet
grain
finish
with
a
little
sour
edge
not
quite
a
beer
to
seek
out
but
it
came
in
quite
handy
when
washing
down
two
andouille
sausages
with
sweet
relish
mustard
and
chili
eh
its
beer
it
begins
with
a
crisp
malt
character
mixed
wiht
some
cereal
raw
grains
with
a
pilsner
malt
sweetness
and
mild
astringency
lightly
hopped
adding
a
mild
tealike
flavor
and
bitterness
that
barely
offsets
the
sweetness
moderate
acidity
takes
the
shape
of
tomatoes
and
sulfer
however
kinda
add
to
the
complexity
in
a
wierd
sort
of
way
a
buttery
flavor
becomes
more
prominent
in
the
texture
but
does
add
some
flavor
like
pop
corn
both
crisp
an
dslick
in
the
mouthfeel
but
finishes
with
a
hearty
grain
flavor
probably
a
fine
beer
to
chase
down
the
polish
sausages
d
hey
this
is
an
o
k
lager
a
bit
too
sweet
and
not
as
clean
as
i
hoped
nevertheless
its
pretty
easy
to
drink
worth
a
try
but
poland
offers
much
better
beers
than
this
one
a
drinkable
beer
after
youve
had
a
few
nothing
to
go
out
of
your
way
for
drinkabilty
is
also
fine
i
could
have
another
but
im
not
sure
i
would
want
to
wont
buy
again
but
fun
to
try
overall
seems
like
just
a
standard
macro
lager
nothing
special
here
just
a
little
stronger
on
abv
poured
a
sparkling
clear
yellow
into
my
standard
mug
this
beer
is
heavily
carbonated
creating
a
frothy
white
head
that
lingers
for
a
few
minutes
the
smell
is
a
little
hoppy
some
grains
present
there
is
a
bitter
hop
taste
that
is
up
front
with
this
one
and
i
also
detect
a
honeylike
sweetness
in
the
background
malts
or
corn
although
i
wouldnt
expect
corn
in
a
beer
of
this
quality
overall
a
descent
polish
pils
d
clean
and
somewhat
refreshing
really
not
a
bad
lager
at
all
i
might
have
to
try

one

when
summer
rolls
around
pours

with

by
a
grassygrain
taste
and
a
touch
of
the
skunkiness
really
couldnt
distinguish
much
else
light
and
crisp
heavily
carbonated
overall
this
is
not
a
great
beer
but
a
very
good
mediocre
one
there
is
a
little
kick
to
it
with
the
5
7
abv
and
does
go
down
smoothly
after
my
first
bottle
it
was
easy
to
pour
another
this
really
is
not
my
favorite
style
but
i
could
see
this
scoring
very
high
with
someone
who
is
fond
of
the
euro
pale
eric
taste
has
a
moderately
bitter
aftertaste
watery
body
with
high
carbonation
flavors
were
subdued
some
pale
malt
and
grassy
hop
at
the
end
a
step
up
from
swill
but
not
far
from
it
one
to
have
several
of
when
you
dont
want
to
think
much
about
it
better
than
bmc
but
not
any
better
than
heineken
or
similar
euro
lager
interesting
beer
it
pours
a
yellow
color
with
a
short
white
head
the
aroma
is
interesting
sweet
bready
smell
it
smells
kind
of
like
malta
goya
malty
and
a
little
pruney
the
taste
at
first
is
like
the
smell
it
then
mellows
out
for
a
less
offensive
taste
it
is
nicely
carbonated
for
a
beer
like
this
good
mouthfeel
but
not
a
very
drinkable
taste
i
would
not
recommend
this
beer
but
it
was
interesting
to
have
one
of
these
a
golden
yellow
beer
with
a
soft
velvety
head
a
pleasant
hoppy
flavor
with
fruit
like
overtones
a
robust
fullflavor
very
refreshing
and
satisfying
thirst
quenching
yet
leaves
you
wanting
more
a
great
beer
this
is
better
than
most
light
lagers
although
flawed
it
still
is
a
decent
offering

this
is
a
pretty

lager
it
tastes
better
than
it
looked

smelled
this
beer
was
everywhere
and
everyone
was
drinking
it

it
was
not
the
beer
i
traveled

i
see
small

on

just
enough

smelling
this
beer
reminds
me
of
that
skunky

is
exceptionally
clean

just
enough
carbonation
as
i
drink
zywiec

very
drinkable
for

i
would
suggest
this
as
a
very
drinkable

with

may
not

up
to

a
fuzzy
white
head
on
pouring
that
settled
quickly
with
just
a
thin
ring
around
the
glass
and
a
wisp
in
the
middle
this
is
carbonated
alright
but
the
bubbles
are
large
similar
to
a
ginger
ale
colour
is
clear
almost
yellow
make
that
yelloworange
no
discernable
smell
at
first
but
as
it
warmed
i
thought
i
detected
a
whiff
of
tarragon
mild
bitterness
and
mild
hops
with
a
clean
almost
malted
barley
in
the
finish
but
feint
at
best
toasty
mouthfeel
a
bit
piqued
but
not
too
sharp
really
for
this
style
of
beer
this
is
a
reliable
quaffing
beer
to
be
enjoyed
with
friends
on
a
hot
day
not
to
be
taken
too
seriously
skip
it
lots
of
better
stuff
out
there
dthis
is
probably
the
best
of
the
polish
lagers
but
still
it
really
does
nothing
for
me
living
in
a
polish
neighbourhood
i
have
tried
pretty
much
all
of
the
beers
the
country
has
to
offer
and
the
porters
are
where
they
shine
this
is
basically
the
leastoffensive
of
the
bunch
of
pale
lagers
summary
a
wellbuilt
euro
pale
lager
but
nothing
outstanding
about
it
hops
dominate
the
beverage
a
decent
massmarket
polish
beer
that
deserves
a
look
if
youre
into
the
style
or
in
poland
the
aroma
is
fairly
funky
but
i
cant
tell
if
its
supposed
to
be
like
that
or
if
its
from
the
travel
it
sort
of
comes
off
like
barnyard
hops
but
the
flavor
isnt
really
present
in
the
flavor
the
taste
is
clean
and
slightly
bready
nothing
real
fruity
like
in
a
heineken
basically
clean
and
drinkable
pours
a
light
golden
color
with
a
two
finger
white
head
with
a
easy
pour
head
settles
to
a
ring
on
the
glass
and
some
lacing
to
the
finish
aromas
are
earthy
with
hops
there
taste
is
bready
yeasty
slightly
sweet
up
front
ending
with
a
slightly
salty
taste
mouthfeel
light
and
nicely
carbonated
i
happen
to
like
a
good
lager
and
this
one
is
not
bad
good
session
beer
although
not
my
favorite
style
of
beer
i
did
indeed
enjoy
this
beer
the
color
was
a
nice
straw
color
leaving
a
white
lace
on
the
glass
the
smell
was
overall
sweet
and
that
sweetness
continued
with
the
taste
if
i
were
to
come
across
this
beer
again
id
give
it
another
try
certainly
this
is
an
easy
beer
to
drink
pretty
much
this
is
in
the
heineken
class
of
beers
with
a
bit
more
in
the
hops
department
overall
good
but
not
memorable
this
person
again
lol
in
appearance
this
beer
pours
a
pale
pale
yellow
with
a
23
finger
white
foamy
head
that
thins
quick
taste
is
wheaty
with
light
hops
and
water
the
warmer
it
is
the
more
sour
it
gets
its
thin
and
crisp
in
the
mouth
i
was
really
in
the
mood
for
a
tasty
surprise
tonight
and
i
must
say
that
i
was
let
down
nonetheless
i
did
only
spend
8
bucks
and
this
is
a
fairly
drinkable
beer
so
it
wasnt
a
complete
loss
just
a
little
dissappointed
borrowing
from
their
marketing
campaign
in
poland
you
could
say
this
is
prawie
jak
pilsner
translation
almost
like
a
pilsner
poured
a
short
but
sturdy
bright
white
head
streams
of
tiny
bubbles
rise
through
the
glowing
golden
beers
weak
aroma
of
sweet
grain
or
corn
or
something
foul
the
sweetness
carries
over
into
the
flavor
and
doesnt
allow
anything
else
to
poke
through
well
maybe
there
is
a
bit
of
herbal
hop
flavor
towards
the
end
but
the
finish
is
grossly
sweet
ive
seen
good
beer
in
cans
here
in
germany
and
i
figured
this
would
be
a
nice
pilsner
type
beer
boy
was
i
wrong
this
is
like
the
european
version
of
malt
liquor
dark
see
through
golden
in
color
absolutely
no
head
faint
grainy
hops
touches
of
biscuit
notes
on
the
nose
blah
raw
grainy
malt
grassyhay
like
tastings
in
the
initial
quaffs
all
signs
point
towards
another
bland
eurolager
very
cloying
and
massive
onslaught
flavorings
of
corn
and
malt
infused
adjuncts
wet
stale
cardboard
and
more
hay
like
offerings
bland
and
stale
even
when
fresh
skip
unless
your
playing
scrabble
notes
as
this
warms
up
the
flaws
become
bigger
and
bigger
drink
this
baby
cold
sadly
i
actually
have
a
zywiec
glass
which
this
was
poured
into
but
nothing
can
save
this
monstrosity
from
itself
pours
a
light
golden
color
with
white
fluffy
head
that
clings
to
the
glass
smells
very
spicy
hoppy
and
a
little
light
struck
tastes
very
clean
a
tiny
bit
sweet
but
balanced
with
hoppy
bitterness
finishes
very
clean
mouthfeel
is
heavy
and
a
little
creamy
but
with
some
carbonation
on
the
tip
of
the
tongue
very
nice
overall
its
a
very
drinkable
beer
clean
but
still
flavorful
ill
probably
be
getting
this
again
mouthfeeldrinkability

in

and

still

from
the
elevated

a

decent

ill
be
trying
this

again
poured

balanced
with
a
slightly
sweet
corn
taste
with
a
slight
bitter
finish
mouthfeel
is
very
light
with
not
too
much
carbonation
the
beer
is
pretty
drinkable
because
of
the
light
body
and
bearable
taste
poured
a
500
ml
bottle
into
a
glass
mug
it
had
a
light
golden
hay
color
with
about
a
halfinch
white
head
that
reduced
to
almost
nothing
but
then
held
okay
after
a
few
sips
the
head
was
gone
all
together
a
malty
fruity
smell
that
almost
seemed
sweet
at
first
it
has
a
slightly
bitter
fruity
taste
but
by
the
middle
of
the
beer
the
malts
really
explode
the
bitterness
disappears
and
the
sweetness
of
the
beer
comes
through
tasted
very
smooth
with
a
pleasant
malty
aftertaste
a
nice
mouthfeel
that
i
can
only
describe
as
smoothly
thick
a
nice
drinkable
beer
very
easy
going
and
an
all
around
solid
brew
i
wonder
if
they
brew
in
a
different
location
for
bottles
and
cans
this
was
a
completely
different
beer
to
the
canned
one
everything
was
better
from
the
bottled
version
this
is
one
of
the
most
popular
beers
in
poland
especially
with
young
people
pours
a
light
golden
color
large
bubbly
head
dissipates
quickly
not
much
nose
going
on
here
but
lightly
metallic
a
but
skunky
bitterness
too
taste
is
fairly
bland
as
well
light
malt
a
very
faint
hoppiness
and
some
starch
it
has
a
very
dry
and
crisp
finish
and
its
drinkability
is
high
due
to
its
lightness
somewhat
typical
of
other
euro
lagerspilseners
well
for
a
free
beer
i
can
not
knock
this
one
too
much
poured
a
crystal
clear
yellow
golden
color
disappointing
snow
white
head
that
disappeared
as
fast
as
it
came
no
lacing
at
all
nor
was
i
expecting
any
smells
rather
sweet
with
a
pungent
bread
like
yeast
some
subtle
hop
florals
and
a
hint
of
a
pale
malt
taste
was
alright
rather
bland
with
a
sharp
pungent
aftertaste
sticks
around
the
back
of
the
mouth
for
a
while
not
bad
but
it
reminds
me
of
drinking
heineken
way
to
much
it
is
a
rather
watery
brew
very
light
bodied
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
would
not
want
to
drink
it
very
frequently
it
was
neat
to
try
a
different
beer
being
my
first
from
poland
i
liked
the
bottle
quite
a
bit
they
had
a
cleaver
color
changing
logo
on
the
back
label
that
turned
red
when
the
beer
was
at
the
best
temperature
for
drinking
i
cant
wait
now
until
one
of
the
mass
american
beers
takes
that
on
clearly
marked
with
a
best
by
date
it
was
an
alright
offering
but
clearly
not
a
perfect
match
for
my
taste
zywiec
is
nice
on
a
hot
summer
day
goes
down
smooth
i
used
to
live
in
michigan
little
poland
hamtramick
and
zywiec
was
served
in
all
the
polish
resturants
and
it
goes
really
well
with
the
combo
plate
slightly
lingering
skunky
aftertaste
other
than
its
a
great
beer
honesty
ive
had
worse
its
not
as
bad
as
it
sounds
out
of
the
eastern
european
selections
i
have
tried
recently
i
would
say
this
is
not
nearly
as
good
as
czeckvar
the
label
shows
a
happy
couple
dancing
in
typical
polish
dress
i
like
that
poured
strawcoloured
with
a
very
small
head
and
the
glass
was
clean
and
residuefree
smells
of
sweet
malt
and
hay
nice
sweet
malty
straw
taste
with
a
medium
mouthfeel
very
lively
on
the
palate
as
well
not
bad
but
i
can
think
of
many
better
eurolagers
will
definitely
buy
it
again
if
its
on
sale
man
this
is
good
it
has
a
slightly
deeper
malt
taste
than
alot
of
other
lagers
which
helps
temper
hop
bitterness
metallic
taste
is
rather
big
here
but
it
isnt
harsh
and
actually
kind
of
works
its
a
little
like
licking
a
new
penny
alcohol
comes
out
a
bit
toward
the
end
every
now
and
then
an
almost
fruity
taste
pops
up
through
the
light
sweetness
i
guess
this
is
kinda
flawed
and
funky
but
its
also
flavorful
and
smooth
and
i
like
it
mouthfeel
is
fullbodied
and
lively
and
i
doubt
this
beer
will
last
long
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
a
1
white
head
above
the
clear
light
golden
brew
frothy
head
is
active
falling
but
being
rejuvenated
as
well
with
ample
lacing
aroma
is
lightly
sweet
with
some
floral
hoppiness
taste
is
also
finds
the
sweet
pale
grains
coupled
with
crisp
saaz
hoppiness
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
okay
but
this
just
doesnt
quite
come
together
as
nicely
as
i
hoped
to
be
a
warm
weather
thirst
quencher
still
not
a
bad
brew
drinks
okay
pretty
tasty
for
the
style
imo
this
tasted
a
little
better
in
germany
but
still
worth
a
shot
d
this
one
gets
the
meh
rating
but
i
should
say
that
i
dont
think
that
euro
lagers
really
float
my
boat
with
that
said
it
seems
like
this
fits
style
guidelines
and
is
everything
that
it
is
supposed
to
be
overall
not
bad
zywiec
beer
pours
a
pale
yellow
with
a
white
head
from
a
brown
twelve
ounce
bottle
with
a
beer
thermometer
that
says
the
beer
is
ready
to
be
drank
if
you
can
see
the
logo
aroma
is
mild
and
grainy
taste
isnt
quite
what
i
was
expecting
grainy
yes
but
also
a
good
amount
of
hops
frankly
i
think
this
is
better
than
a
lot
of
euro
macro
lagers
that
said
it
still
leaves
something
to
be
desired
fairly
average
i
wouldnt
turn
my
nose
up
at
one
worth
a
try
not
the
worst
of
polish
lagers
but
another
representative
of
this
style
brewed
at
zywiec
subsidiary
in
cieszyn
is
far
better
not
much
aroma
but
a
decent
looking
beer
tastes
like
they
used
hallertau
bittering
hops
in
this
but
forgot
the
aroma
hops
a
sortof
sweet
and
heavy
mouthfeel
on
this
brings
drinkability
down
a
tad
its
not
bad
but
not
outstanding
either
over
all
i
found
this
beer
to
be
very
crisp
and
extremely
refreshing
on
a
warm
summer
night
it
is
drinkable
but
not
anything
special
on
par
or
not
much
above
with
the
typical
eurolagers
at
least
its
in
a
brown
bottle
might
be
worse
in
green
certainly
better
than
heineken
becks
or
several
other
popular
euros
my
first
polish
beer
i
had
never
seen
this
beer
before
prior
to
drinking
it
and
i
had
no
idea
what
to
expect
from
it
it
pours
golden
and
has
a
surprisingly
nice
head
for
a
pilsner
it
tastes
a
bit
like
heine
which
is
no
surprise
considering
that
heine
owns
this
brewery
overall
a
pleasant
though
unremarkable
beer
the
best
thing
about
it
is
its
beautiful
label
complete
with
a
beer
thermometer
that
tells
when
the
beer
is
at
drinking
temperature
drinkability
overall
a
decent
euro
pale
lager
that
i
probably
wouldnt
buy
again
if
i
ever
see
it
again
something
you
only
need
try
once
at
thats
it
smell
not
much
there
a
decent
head
is
formed
when
poured
but
dissipates
quickly
this
beer
starts
out
like
a
robust
continental
lager
finishes
with
a
little
hop
spicyness
that
hints
at
a
pilsner
when
frothed
on
the
palate
a
few
subtle
citrus
notes
are
released
and
a
little
malt
sweetness
can
be
detected
dare
i
say
this
but
it
tastes
slightly
like
a
dortmunder
with
its
nononsense
tastecold
refreshing
not
weak
i
was
hoping
this
brew
might
be
a
little
more
complex
but
feels
like
a
euromacro
if
there
is
such
i
applaud
the
polish
for
making
a
nice
fullbodied
beer
and
the
5
6
alcohol
adds
a
little
backbone
cheers
joe
taste
is
all
nice
bready
malts
a
bit
alcoholic
and
a
refreshing
bitterness
from
the
noble
hops
flavour
wise
this
is
a
really
well
balanced
and
pleasant
lager
better
than
average
nice
tongue
bite
goes
down
pretty
smooth
i
think
this
would
be
a
really
good
summer
session
beer
nothing
majorly
special
but
as
euro
lagers
go
it
isnt
too
bad
another
polish
pale
lager
coming
in
the
500ml
brown
bottle
nice
enough
labelling
white
with
lots
of
red
and
traditionallyclad
figures
of
a
man
and
womanthe
cap
has
the
same

the

on
the

has
a
little

i
have
never
seen
before
and
i
thought
it
was
cool
in
a
little
box
are
the
words
beer
thermometer
and
then
beside
that
it
says
refrigerate
wait
until
zywiec
logo
appears
that
indicates
ideal
drinking
temperature
sure
enough
a
little
red
zywiec
symbol
appears
after
cooling
the
bottle
first
time
i
have
ever
seen
that
zywiec
is
a
superclear
honeygolden
colour
with
a
fairly
dense
but
quickly
moving
aspirinwhite
head
rapidly
moving
lacing
the
head
settled
as
a
patchy
paperthin
covering
a
typical
and
average
looking
polish
lager
the
nose
is
a
mixture
of
honey
and
fresh
green
grass
dusty
continental
hopping
some
sweetish
light
malts
and
a
hint
of
spritzy
alcohol
there
is
a
bit
of
a
creamy
marshmallow
aroma
too
more
malty
than
a
dortexport
or
czech
pils
the
hops
are
well
balanced
with
the
malt
though
and
all
in
all
this
is
a
good
aroma
for
its
purpose
and
style
no
off
smells
again
average
as
the
beer
warms
the
aroma
seems
to
exhibit
too
much
sugary
maltiness
like
maltliquor
the
beers
taste
is
rather
light
overall
with
honeyed
malts
and
the
faintest
hint
of
dusty
bitterness
there
is
a
bit
of
a
sourishunderdeveloped
malt
note
here
adding
some
unpleasant
cardboard
tastes
it
finishes
decently
leaving
equal
parts
light
sweetness
and
coppery
dryness
the
poor
malt
flavour
seems
to
be
at
the
front
of
the
tongue
because
in
the
middle
and
back
the
malting
is
all
right
adding
some
toasty
bread
flavours
there
is
really
nothing
much
else
to
describe
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
in
carbonation
and
light
bodied
quaffable
i
grant
you
there
is
really
nothing
to
complain
about
here
despite
zywiecs
commonality
and
average
flavour
still
better
than
a
plethora
of
lagers
out
there
overall
a
very
average
beer
worth
a
try
maybe
once
bham
uk
dec
2005
feels
ok
in
the
mouth
cold
crisp
medium
carbonation
drinkable
but
nothing
special
i
would
recommend
this
my
first
polish
beer
but
not
my
last
in
a
way
it
reminds
me
of
grolsch
another
european
pale
lager
but
a
bit
different
if
you
like
grolsch
you
like
this
beer
this
beer
had
a
nice
thermal
label
that
changed
color
when
the
beer
was
the
right
temperature
to
drink
the
beer
poured
a
real
pale
straw
color
clear
with
a
dense
white
head
strong
sweet
malt
aroma
with
faint
floral
hops
and
a
little
skunk
as
it
warms
the
malt
aroma
opens
up
with
hints
of
vienna
or
munich
malt
the
flavor
is
malty
sweet
not
very
bitter
at
all
and
a
touch
of
hops
and
a
creaminess
in
the
finish
the
body
is
solid
for
a
pale
lager
and
the
sweetness
stays
around
longer
than
most
others
the
malt
flavor
is
amazing
for
such
a
pale
beer
making
this
beer
a
must
try
one
note
although
i
was
immune
many
of
the
expats
i
worked
with
in
poland
avoided
the
beer
for
its
suppossed
reaction
on
their
bowel
movements
giving
it
the
nickname
that
rhymes
with
its
pronunciation
of
jivyits
jivyshits
to
be
fair
though
we
drank
an
awful
lot
that
year
so
i
wouldnt
neccesarily
blame
the
beer
more
the
lifestyle
give
it
a
chance
if
you
can
find
it
nastrovia
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
has
some
nice
aspects
but
is
far
from
being
spectacular
poured
out
to
a
nice
golden
color
with
a
foamy
white
head
some
lace
was
in
the
glass
something
that
was
quite
a
suprise
considering
the
style
aromas
of
malt
and
hops
was
appealing
but
rather
ordinary
taste
was
pretty
quaffable
flavors
of
malt
grain
corn
and
hops
were
in
balance
with
a
touch
of
a
sweet
character
toward
the
middle
mouthfeel
was
slightly
weaker
than
i
would
have
cared
for
but
not
what
i
would
refer
to
as
watery
good
drinkability
this
is
a
decent
beer
at
a
decent
price
this
is
what
i
would
think
of
when
the
term
european
macro
was
being
used
not
bad
worth
a
try
if
you
come
across
it
like
many
euro
lagers
this
one
was
not
impressive
in
anay
catagories
one
of
the
few
beers
i
could
not
even
finish
dropping
it
to
one
of
my
lowest
reviews
yet
best
part
was
the
bar
itself
not
the
beer
md
the
merit
is
the
semilively
fizzy
palate
turns
more
and
more
dry
whereas
the
mouthfeel
inevitably
feels
thinish
in
the
end
due
to
the
lack
of
body
and
a
residual
sugary
undertone
is
not
so
much
appreciated
overall
quite
easydrinking
this
beer
is
sitting
inbetween
a
drypilsner
in
need
of
more
assertive
hop
aroma
and
a
bavarian
helles
requiring
greater
malt
presence
not
a
bad
lager
but
nothing
spectacular
not
bad
i
bought
it
in
a
500
ml
bottle
for
what
most
other
330mls
cost
so
as
well
as
being
a
pleasant
drink
is
reasonably
cheap
if
this
was
sitting
next
to
miller
id
take
this
unless
it
cost
more
this
is
a
decent
beer
that
wont
blow
your
socks
off
but
does
display
an
interesting
battle
between
the
malt
and
hops
throughout
the
profile
while
there
isnt
anything
wrong
with
this
im
sure
i
can
probably
find
something
cheaper
that
is
as
pleasing
or
something
the
same
price
that
is
more
satisfying

good
poorout
with
lasting

and
nice
and
clear
golden
beer
nose
is
lot
less
very
papery
sweetish
oxidised
and
a
far
from
fresh
maltarome
taste
is
as
the
smell
oxisidised
maltiness
sweetish
empty
and
hardly
any
bitterness
empty
watery
and
unfresh
mouthfeel
makes
drinkability
to
undrinkable
one
of
my
worst
lager
expiriences
recently
one
to
avoid
bottle
poured
a
golden
color
lager
with
a
large
head
with
minimal
retention
aroma
of
crispy
malt
is
quite
enjoyable
taste
is
constituted
of
crispy
malt
with
some
floral
hops
very
refreshing
beer
but
this
bottle
version
may
have
not
travelled
that
well
overseas
since
there
was
a
subtle
skunkyness
to
be
found
at
the
end
this
is
easy
to
drink
but
i
think
it
might
be
an
acquired
taste
the
beer
thermometer
is
a
fairly
useless
invention
but
neat
nonetheless
would
i
buy
this
again
maybe
its
not
bad
but
it
could
stand
to
be
better
overall
much
like
heineken
really
buy
this
for
the
folkdancing
mascots
only
this
is
a
pretty
nice
beer
and
it
sure
as
hell
warms
you
up
with
its
5
7
abv
but
its
nothing
to
write
home
about
zywiec
is
an
average
epl
making
it
a
below
average
beer
in
general
more
hops
would
help
but
if
its
been
brewed
since
1856
with
the
same
recipe
one
would
guess
then
its
doubtful
that
we
can
expect
a
change
at
this
late
date
besides
maybe
there
are
those
who
love
this
stuff
and
buy
it
by
the
case
it
isnt
for
me
though
quite
a
drinkable
brew
brought
to
us
by
stanley
stawski
from
the
biggest
polish
city
outside
of
warsaw
chicago
a
clean
golden
yellow
beer
has
abig
bright
white
foamy
head
there
is
a
sweet
grassy
aroma
with
a
light
biscuty
background
the
flavor
is
a
little
light
sweetness
at
first
with
abit
of
grainy
smoothness
in
the
middle
and
a
nice
even
hops
bite
on
the
finish
there
is
a
good
clean
refreshing
mouthfeel
to
this
beer
which
makes
it
easy
to
enjoy
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
at
all
a
bit
of
a
hop
aroma
sort
of
minerallike
as
well
medium
gold
body
with
a
tight
white
head
the
flavor
follows
the
nose
with
crisp
hops
and
a
mineralwater
finish
mouthfeel
is
decent
ad
the
beer
is
overall
refreshing
not
an
impressive
beer
but
not
something
id
refuse
like
most
bmc
products
i
wouldnt
buy
it
but
ill
drink
it
not
at
all
bad
for
what
it
is
compared
to
a
typical
macro
type
import
it
stands
up
well
its
a
pale
lager
what
do
you
want
good
clear
body
and
a
frothy
head
aroma
is
very
muted
flavor
is
fair
a
bit
bland
but
there
is
a
tiny
note
of
bready
malt
and
a
touch
of
spicy
hop
finish
strongly
carbonated
fairly
refreshing
beer
i
could
put
them
away
all
night
but
there
are
better
beers
id
rather
be
drinking
not
as
good
as
the
porter
but
not
too
bad
average
but
still
refreshing
beer
i
found
it
pairs
well
with
somewhat
spicy
or
sour
foods
whether
hot
peppers
or
cabbagesauerkraut
as
well
as
pork
rather
appropriate
for
a
brew
from
poland
this
is
a
rather
standard
eurolager
all
the
way
it
doesnt
offer
much
that
will
tantilize
the
tastebuds
but
it
remains
drinkable
na
zdrowie
it
pours
a
very
pale
straw
color
with
a
few
lazy
bubbles
the
head
is
shortlived
almost
instantly
receding
to
a
small
ring
lacing
is
moderate
the
aroma
is
stiff
malts
some
grassy
hops
and
a
little
bit
aof
dms
the
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
grainyness
and
a
few
cooked
veggie
flavors
hops
at
least
are
present
the
mouthfeel
is
grainy
and
quite
full
bodied
this
a
bit
of
astringency
in
the
finish
that
could
mean
skunk
overall
though
this
is
an
inoffensive
beer
with
a
bit
more
flavor
than
blue
or
coors
but
still
not
a
lot
of
flavor
drinkability
nice
and
different
beer
cant
say
i
have
had
one
exactly
like
it
before
interesting
ill
give
it
that
would
have
again
good
price
for
what
i
got
to
sample
oh
yeah
it
has
good
fuzzyclean
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
is
excellent
clear
medium
yellow
appearance
mousselike
head
of
intermediate
bubbles
and
staying
power
broken
thick
horizontal
bands
for
laces
grassy
lightly
sufurous
pale
grape
jelly
mark
the
aroma
lighter
body
prightly
carbonation
livens
up
the
start
of
the
flavor
profile
not
too
sweet
in
the
malt
department
a
fruity
astringency
shows
and
intertwines
with
a
solid
hoppiness
thats
crisp
and
wellattenuates
the
close
refreshing
and
not
complex
a
decent
mix
of
toasted
grain
and
balancing
hops
some
alcohol
sense
id
keep
some
cans
around
for
the
warm
weather
pours
a
straw
gold
color
slightly
hazy
head
is
bubbly
and
not
long
lasting
smell
is
of
grassy
malt
and
light
skunk
taste
is
cliche
euro
lager
grass
small
hops
nothing
interesting
not
even
a
good
fallback
i
would
rather
shudder
have
a
budweiser
the
taste
was
bitter
with
a
mildly
sweet
aftertaste
now
dont
get
me
wrong
i
love
a
bitter
beer
but
this
one
just
didnt
stand
out
yeah
i
admit
it
i
sometimes
fall
back
on
this
beer
hey
at
least
its
not
a
bud
or
coors
or
corona
pours
out
a
straw
gold
color
with
a
nice
amount
of
carbonation
smell
consisted
of
hops
but
then
died
off
after
a
while
taste
was
decent
enough
some
malts
and
grains
show
up
with
some
hop
spiciness
that
comes
in
at
the
middle
and
lasts
into
the
aftertaste
seemed
a
little
light
but
it
wasnt
in
a
bad
way
there
seemed
to
be
a
touch
of
citrus
at
the
end
as
well
which
was
refreshing
when
this
is
fresh
this
beer
could
be
on
a
grassy
metallic
malt
taste
predominates
almost
a
burnt
popcorn
note
works
its
way
into
an
otherwise
passable
malt
backbone
slippery
not
quite
wholesome
mouthfeel
poland
can
keep
the
rest
of
this
nice
beer
nothing
outstanding
but
a
good
chugger
as
part
of
a
tasting
including
a
polish
friend
of
mine
at
the
sousbock
in
paris
we
decided
to
try
their
national
zywiec
however
i
was
very
disappointed
in
it
first
off
the
weak
lager
perception
a
simple
straw
clear
pour
with
a
bit
of
a
head
and
not
much
else
a
smell
clearly
hoppy
and
with
some
malts
reminding
me
of
pilsners
which
are
not
btw
my
favourites
the
taste
shared
among
an
initial
malty
slight
sweetness
a
posterior
metallic
pilsner
like
feel
and
finally
a
considerable
bitterness
is
not
excessive
but
not
watery
either
enhancing
the
mouthfeel
poured
a
clear
golden
straw
color
with
a
very
impressive
white
head
that
slowly
dissipated
into
a
sheet
of
lace
that
clinged
to
the
glass
a
pleasant
malty
aroma
was
noticeable
with
a
slight
floral
hop
fragrance
it
had
a
biscuity
sweet
malt
taste
that
was
balanced
by
a
floralspicey
hop
flavor
the
body
is
medium
with
a
fine
to
moderate
carbonation
that
leaves
a
slightly
creamy
mouthfeel
it
finishes
smooth
and
light
with
a
fairly
dry
aftertaste
that
lingered
overall
a
pleasant
beer
with
some
nice
malt
and
hop
character
overall
absolutely
undrinkable
man
i
know
they
drink
antifreeze
and
petrol
in
poland
but
this
is
worse
pale
golden
body
with
a
thin
head
of
white
foam
fed
by
forced
carbonation
slightly
sulfurous
hop
aroma
is
typical
of
mass
produced
european
lagers
slightly
sweet
malt
taste
is
pleasant
and
refreshing
mouthfeel
is
thin
but
appropriate
for
the
style
this
defines
the
average
of
the
entire
spectrum
of
beers
for
me
i
wish
this
was
their
porter
appearance
golden
straw
tone
thin
white
head
not
too
impressed
thin
lacing
aroma
grassy
hop
nite
with
a
mildly
citrus
grassiness
from
the
grains
there
not
bad
clean
smelling
not
too
complex
taste
not
very
flavorful
touch
of
grainy
sweetness
very
bland
hop
bitterness
is
untraceable
to
my
tastebuds
dissapointment
mouthfeel
very
thin
weak
carbonation
watery
not
going
to
waste
my
money
on
this
one
again
drinkability
unoffensive
and
light
bodied
seems
like
too
many
would
leave
me
with
a
cracking
headache
one
is
enough
served
in
a
iced
branded
mug
clear
dark
yellowish
tone
bleached
white
head
that
faded
quickly
i
couldnt
smell
much
of
anything
other
than
some
light
hops
on
the
nose
remarkably
ordinary
lager
that
impersonates
a
pilsner
on
occasion
more
malty
on
the
tongue
than
expected
finish
was
clean
and
it
was
crisp
troughout
typical
feel
and
drinkability
i
did
find
this
was
the
beer
i
liked
most
of
the
polish
beers
i
got
to
try
in
warsaw
and
rzeszow
but
that
isnt
saying
much
the
beer
pours
a
pale
gold
color
with
a
spotty
white
lace
head
the
aroma
is
decent
it
is
typical
lager
scent
pale
malts
and
lager
yeast
it
does
have
a
refreshingly
sweet
aroma
that
grabs
my
attention
the
taste
is
average
it
is
light
with
a
simplistic
malt
makeup
it
finishes
dry
and
clean
with
no
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
good
it
is
a
low
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
decent
lager
but
nothing
i
would
drink
again
but
at
least
there
is
a
beer
thermometer
on
the
bottle
so
i
am
assured
that
i
consumed
it
at
the
proper
temperature
what
a
revolutionary
device
nice
pour
on
this
one
frothy
white
head
and
a
very
pale
golden
yellow
color
with
a
low
carbonation
very
lucid
huge
grassy
hop
note
emanates
from
the
beer
along
with
lively
and
spicy
sweet
grains
the
taste
is
very
smooth
and
crisp
grainy
character
comes
through
with
a
touch
of
lemon
zest
the
body
is
light
and
finishes
with
some
oiliness
this
is
my
second
polish
lager
and
i
must
say
this
is
another
winner
very
nice
and
highly
quaffable
a
beer
of
high
quality
very
good
it
has
the
most
enticing
aroma
a
clean
finish
with
a
bit
of
hoppiness
and
a
gorgeous
head
i
buy
zywiec
whenever
i
see
it
and
i
have
never
been
disappointed
it
is
a
very
consistent
bottle
and
a
pleasure
to
drink
my
only
negative
is
that
it
seems
a
little
thin
something
that
always
takes
my
by
surprise
i
bought
this
beer
on
a
weekend
trip
to
poland
earlier
last
year
and
havent
tryed
it
untill
now
it
has
a
nice
golden
colour
with
a
nice
head
the
smell
is
weak
and
it
smeel
wheat
it
has
a
little
sweet
taste
but
not
to
sweet
for
me
and
it
has
almost
no
bitterness
i
like
beer
with
more
bitter
taste
than
this
beer
but
it
is
a
beer
you
can
drink
alot
of
if
you
like
strong
polish
beers
i
drank
quite
of
few
of
these
over
the
past
few
months
and
i
can
say
that
ive
never
been
disappointed
quite
a
nice
looking
beerstraw
gold
foam
for
a
brief
momentbut
nothing
out
of
this
world
i
dont
recall
anything
out
of
the
ordinary
about
the
smellcertainly
not
anything
negative
that
others
have
noted
i
dont
mind
the
flavour
but
a
friend
who
tried
it
when
i
first
brought
it
home
was
immediately
turned
off
by
it
a
good
brew
to
have
now
and
again
but
nothing
to
die
for
pours
a
crystal
clear
golden
straw
color
with
a
small
amount
of
fine
wheat
head
nose
is
dominated
by
crisp
grains
with
just
a
hint
of
skunkiness
the
smell
actually
outclasses
the
taste
which
is
characterized
by
yeasty
notes
that
the
clingy
mouthfeel
keep
hanging
around
even
longer
its
best
feature
is
a
bit
of
hoppy
crispness
that
is
too
fleeting
for
a
beer
that
looks
and
smells
this
crisp
the
sticky
mouthfeel
is
rather
surprising
this
is
ok
but
nothing
more
also
one
has
to
note
that
with
the
exchange
rate
at
time
of
review
i
paid
scarcely
125
us
for
a
pint
any
qualtity
beer
that
priced
this
reasonable
can
not
be
knocked
it
forms
a
large
head
which
disappears
quite
quickly
i
do
like
this
stuff
i
always
pick
up
a
few
bottles
of
this

my
local

is
a

it
does
have
a
high

thermometer
thing
in
the
label
for
letting
you
know
the
correct
temperature
to
drink
this
stuff
but
why
bother
is
zywiec
the
polish
word
for
budweiser
when
i
saw
zywiec
i
thought
i
would
be
getting
the
zywiec
porter
that
everyones
raved
about
instead
i
got
this
pale
lager
another
blah
macro
lager
and
certainly
not
one
id
rush
to
find
again
on
the
other
hand
the
serving
thermometer
was
interesting
but
thats
about
it
yet
another
imported
pale
lager

leafy

bite
and
cereal
grains
are
the
tastes
nice
to
have
no
skunkiness
here
though
overall
better
than
some
domestic
macros
but
nothing
special
this
is
rather
sweet
syrupy
and
malty
kind
of
a
rough

but
there
was
no

i
found
a
good
herbal

presence
and
decent

for
a
pilsner
there
was
some
adjuct

in
the
finish
i
wont
buy
it
again
mind
you
i
got
this
one
as
a
trade
from
a
buddy
of
mine
id
say
he
did
right
by
me
as
it
was
an
easy
drinking
beer
enjoy
if
price
did
not
matter
i
would
not
buy
as
there
is
better
beer
out
there
but
the
price
allows
me
to
drink
a
beer
worth
drinking
when
on
a
budget
its
worth
your
pocket
change
to
buy
something
for
a
party
pours

dull
overall
decent
beer
for
the
style
and
affordable
would
purchase
on
occasion
again
in
the
future
overall
disappointed
here
definitely
some
off
flavors
popping
up
on
the
body
i
would
definitely
pass
on
this
and
go
to
other
polish
pale
lagers
tatra
poured
a
crystal
clear
golden
colour
with
a
thin
white
head
that
disappeared
inside
one
minute
this
beer
actually
looks
more
like
a
cider
but
certainly
has
the
aroma
of
a
beer
sweet
malts
dominate
the
aroma
with
a
hint
of
wet
dirt
the
combination
of
which
actually
works
well
its
taste
was
sweet
light
malts
up
front
with
a
hint
of
wet
dirt
that
disappears
almost
instantly
and
a
mildly
bitter
finish
which
lingered
for
a
few
seconds
i
would
describe
tatra
as
a
smooth
beer
easy
drinking
and
light
bodied
though
with
a
bit
of
a
thin
mouthfeel
to
it
in
summary
a
decent
beer
most
notable
for
that
unique
wet
dirt
aroma
and
taste
not
a
bad
thing
in
this
case
but
not
memorable
enough
that
i
would
buy
it
again
it
was
interesting
enough
that
i
will
try
some
other
polish
beers
though
tatra
is
reasonably
priced
at
1
90
per
500
ml
can
tatra
isnt
going
to
be
one
of
the
first
names
which
i
conjure
with
polish
beer
could
be
worse
could
have
been
infected
im
looking
at
you
new
english
mr
average
in
every
way
o
some
nice
hints
of
flavor
in
here
but
a
bit
thin
and
watery
and
the
hops
start
to
take
on
a
soapy
quality
as
it
warms
overall
a
very
tasty
beer
its
a
little
hard
to
find
here
although
i
might
seek
it
out
one
of
these
days
o
easy
drinking
but
nothing
spectacular
though
i
wasnt
expecting
to
be
blown
away
typical
euro
pale
lager
and
nothing
more
its
pretty
unlikely
id
ever
pick
up
another
can
of
this
a
to
me
this
is
the
epitome
of
many
european
lagers
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
with
a
decent
abv
but
really
nothing
spectacular
it
lacks
any
real
aromas
or
complex
flavors
it
isnt
bad
but
it
isnt
good
either
maybe
the
score
given
doesnt
do
it
justice
since
overall
it
offers
a
good
drinking
experience
nothing
too
vile
nothing
too
fancy
and
for
being
a
cheap
euro
lager
it
does
its
job
well
i
lived
in
poland
for
about
8
months
in
a
small
provincial
town
that
resembled
something
out
of
a
disney
movie
as
a
kid
or
an
english
period
piece
with
daniel
craig
while
there
i
found
that
the
only
beer
available
was
lager
and
lager
and
occasionally
dark
lager
i
liked
the
beer
prices
in
poland
and
liked
how
i
could
pick
up
a
few
brews
from
the
supermarket
being
from
canada
we
can
only
buy
liquor
in
liquor
stores
this
one
was
something
i
picked
up
as
an
alternative
to
the
zywiec
i
normally
drank
and
i
was
glad
i
did
it
poured
a
decent
light
yellow
and
it
smelled
really
quite
sweet
but
not
offputting
i
drank
it
from
the
pint
glass
i
had
in
my
concrete
communist
flat
and
i
enjoyed
its
sweet
nectar
as
it
flowed
nicely
i
had
another
just
to
make
sure
but
this
is
one
i
would
probably
pick
up
from
my
local
liquor
store
just
for
the
nostalgia
it
wont
change
anyones
life
but
it
will
make
you
happy
you
tried
something
different
not
sure
we
need
another
polish
lager
in
bc
we
have
5
already
but
this
is
a
decent
take
on
the
style
that
has
a
full
mouthfeel
and
tasted
pretty
fresh
probably
due
to
the
can
i
used
it
to
make
beer
brats
for
a
new
years
day
lunch
party
and
i
tasted
pretty
good
out
of
the
can
as
i
cooked
those
sausages
pours
a
clear
yellow
with
a
foamy
offwhite
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
tiny
dots
of
lace
slowly
drip
into
the
remaining
beer
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
very
mild
and
is
of
malt
and
grain
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
slight
grassy
and
hay
flavor
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
average
beer
that
is
drinkable
but
nothing
too
special
overall
an
easy
drinking
refreshing
lager
from
zywiec
not
much
to
this
one
but
quite
enjoyable
was
hoping
for
a
bit
more
flavor
although
not
a
beer
style
id
ever
choose
unless
on
a
n
overnight
train
within
europe
certainly
not
the
worst
variant
ive
ever
tried
this
is
a
tolerable
example
of
the
style
definitely
nothing
special
and
not
particularly
refreshing
either
which
sucks
because
thats
kind
of
the
only
reason
to
drink
these
lagers
other
than
maybe
price
not
the
best
polish
beer
ive
had
by
a
long
shot
but
acceptable
value
for
the
price
there
are
no
compelling
reasons
to
drink
this
and
i
doubt
ill
get
it
again
very
comparable
to
zywiec
but
im
a
tyskie
or
zubr
guy
the
beer
is
what
i
figured
it
to
be
an
unobtrusive
pale
lager
without
much
character
or
flavour
straw
yellows
fizzy
white
head
with
no
lacing
a
bit
of
cooked
corn
and
sweet
mat
on
the
nose
decent
body
with
sweetness
and
little
else
of
note
not
what
i
want
in
a
beer
but
it
would
be
a
decent
alternative
to
a
macro
lager
the
first
few
sips
were
quite
nice
sweet
flavorful
refreshing
but
the
sweetness
of
the
brew
coupled
with
the
lack
of
anything
else
interesting
about
it
becomes
tiresome
after
a
few
sips
really
nothing
much
to
say
other
than
i
suppose
its
a
touch
better
than
most
euro
lagers
in
that
the
tinnymetallicherbal
character
is
minimal
at
best
but
theres
nothing
different
here
the
smell
was
light
nice
grain
and
yeasty
bread
like
smell
mixed
in
with
some
kinda
light
fruit
maybe
some
banana
and
a
touch
of
alcohol
but
it
was
pretty
standard
lager
the
taste
was
like
a
really
strong
budweiser
it
tasted
like
your
standard
fare
macro
lager
buch
just
stronger
typical
grain
adn
yeast
maybe
some
corn
in
the
flavor
well
i
was
right
with
the
lager
part
i
grew
up
on
yuengling
lager
and
i
have
to
say
i
now
find
this
more
drinkable
this
beer
is
more
or
less
the
poster
child
for
the
epl
style
it
has
lots
of
bubbles
lots
of
glass
lacing
a
high
alcohol
percent
my
can
is
5
5
abv
and
its
got
that
skunky
characteristic
which
ive
come
to
know
and
love
epls
for
it
delivers
but
it
does
nothing
else
a
classy
high
abv
session
beer
that
would
theoretically
get
the
job
done
a
slight
bit
quicker
than
a
coors
light
or
comparable
light
beer
not
worthy
meshes
quite
well
it
is
one
of
the
better
eastern
euro
beers
that
ive
had
and
would
get
this
one
again

pretty

for

better
than
any

for

this

a
would

solid
highly

goes

very

as

o
taste
exceeds
the

by
far
labeled
a
euro
pale
lager
this
stands
out
in
uniqueness
and
flavor
enjoying
it
the
new
can
style
is
really
hip
as
well
according
to
the
brewerys
web
site
the
company
conducts
45
minute
tasting
and
product
knowledge
sessions
every
friday
and
saturday
for
a
cost
of
10
plus
taxes
but
no
longer
does
tours
thx
for
reading
overall
a
fine
beer
but
as
one
of
the
two
craft
selections
on
tap
that
night
it
was
merely
the
best
available
beer
wouldnt
hesitate
to
get
it
again
but
with
other
watering
holes
just
around
the
corner
offering
over
20
craft
selections
i
probably
wont
be
back
to
try
this
anytime
soon
overall
this
isnt
a
great
beer
but
it
isnt
bad
either
for
a
craft
lager
im
pleased
its
easy
drinking
and
something
you
could
sit
down
with
for
a
long
time
probably
a
step
up
from
labatt
and
molson
canadian
though
ive
not
tried
either
of
those
but
not
notably
so
poured
from
a
tall
boy
into
a
true
pint
the
beer
is
a
bright
yellowgold
coloring
with
a
ton
of
carbonation
bubbling
through
the
body
and
a
thin
frothy
bright

of

and
a

spiced
and

character
at

very

the

is

with

which
is

to
the

nothing

believe
it
to
be
a
better
choice
within

than
many

overall
there
is
just
something
not
right
about
this
beer
i
cant
put
my

on

it
there
is
an

ca
at

the
only
worse
lagers
out
there
are
those
racked
with
industrial
adjuncts
i
dont
think
ive
ever
had
a
less
tasteful
beer
that
wasnt
either
skunked
or
soiled
with
additives
i
cant
imagine
a
reason
to
drink
this
again
pretty
easy
to
drink
if
its
ice
cold
but
gets
too
stick
and
overly
sweet
to
remain
enjoyable
i
suppose
this
is
better
than
a
lot
of
macro
lagers
out
there
but
really
is
it
worth
it
so
many
ontario
sessionables
id
rather
have
than
this
di
got
a
soft
spot
for
this
beer
i
always
forget
about
it
and
rediscover
it
when
i
head
into
the
beerstore
and
cant
figure
out
what
i
want
splitting
a
pitcher
of
this
pours
a
clear
golden
yellow
colour
with
thin
white
head
and
almost
no
lacing
smells
of
lots
of
grains
and
some
very
mild
hops
flavour
is
very
clean
with
some
very
mild
bitterness
good
carbonation
a
typical
bland
ontario
beer
drinkability
not
a
beer
i
would
seek
out
again
or
recommend
to
anyone
looking
for
a
pale
lager
it
does
not
offer
much
along
the
lines
of
unique
taste
d
very
very
easy
to
down
and
not
a
bad
choice
for
a
cheap
can
one
hell
of
a
beer
compared
to
most
macros
but
that
doesnt
say
much
d
drinks
decently
on
tap
at
the
woolwich
arms
in
guelph
ontario
pours
a
sparkling
yellow
body
with
a
thin
white
head
faint
fruity
and
hoppy
aromas
pair
up
with
mild
hops
bitterness
in
the
mouth
and
a
grassy
lingering
finish
good
amount
of
carbonation
standard
fare
overall
a
decent
beer
at
best
but
since
i
have
yet
to
session
more
pronounced
craft
beers
this
is
the
best
to
date
more
tastey
more
body
and
more
drinkability
then
the
other
standard
sessioners
excellent
in
the
field
of
macros
but
mediocre
at
best
in
the
field
of
crafts
had
on
tap
at
an
irish
bar
in
toronto
flynns
or
something
cant
remember
the
bar
name
overall
this
was
a
disappointing
drink
not
unlike
any
number
of
macro
lagers
as
i
will
attempt
to
qualify
the
beer
is
clear
as
water
lpale
yellow
hue
thin
white
head
the
smell
is
muted
and
neutral
mainly
malt
very
mild
flavor
hops
are
present
only
in
a
meager
bitterness
malt
is
minimal
nothing
offensive
but
nothing
compelling
i
dont
want
to
be
overly
critical
so
ill
note
that
this
has
good
carbonation
and
is
not
hard
to
drink
i
wouldnt
have
actually
ordered
it
if
not
for
the
paltry
nature
of
the
other
selections
this
isnt
a
beer
i
would
revisit
simply
because
its
not
my
style
but
i
think
its
been
done
fairly
well
and
have
to
give
it
marks
for
that
it
does
lack
some
of
the
complexity
that
could
be
there
but
i
suppose
thats
not
essential
for
a
simple
summer
quaff
well
this
is
truely
a
gem
of
a
beer
from
toronto
it
reminds
me
alot
of
bricks
red
baron
anyway
onto
the
review
beautiful
golden
yellow
color
with
a
12
inch
head
that
sinks
down
to
a
5
inch
head
and
leaves
rings
of
laceing
all
down
the
glass
smell
is
great
smells
really
fresh
malts
and
nice
hop
aroma
wicked
taste
well
i
really
like
these
blonde
lagers
like
really
like
them
so
to
me
this
is
perfect
goes
down
smooth
carbonated
with
a
nice
crisp
hop
finish
with
little
after
taste
great
mouthfeel
is
full
carbonated
and
satisfying
drinkability
is
through
the
roof
when
cold
these
can
be
consumed
in
excessive
quantities
and
even
when
warm
still
very
drinkable
overall
my
secong
favorite
blonde
lager
next
to
red
baron
if
you
liked
that
beer
you
will
definatly
like
this
beer
this
is
highly
reccommended
overall
its
a
pretty
standard
blonde
nothing
special
here
though
i
enjoyed
the
fact
that
it
wasnt
overly
sweet
watery
mouthfeel
lacks
body
overall
a
decent
lager
that
i
probably
wouldnt
buy
again
but
it
is
cheap
bottle
poured
a
clear
golden
color
lager
with
a
big
pure
white
foamy
head
with
medium
retention
and
no
lacing
aroma
if
quite
refreshing
with
a
light
sweet
malt
profile
taste
is
also
quite
onedimensional
with
some
medium
sweet
malt
and
very
subtle
floral
notes
this
beer
was
as
easily
drinkable
as
it
is
easily
forgettable
this
is
the
type
of
beer
thats
a
welcome
switch
from
traditional
bland
macros
but
the
bite
of
the
taste
leaves
something
to
be
desired
and
i
couldnt
see
myself
downing
a
lot
of
these
in
a
row
pretty
much
a
bythenumbers
european
lager
i
tried
this
beer
on
october
28
2007
after
purchasing
from
my
local
lcbo
outlet
the
bottle
poured
a
very
nice
translucent
gold
into
the
glass
witrh
a
very
loose
frothy
head
thad
disappeared
quickly
the
aroma
is
mildly
hoppish
with
citrus
tones
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumbodied
with
mild
carbonation
the
taste
is
a
combination
of
citrus
tones
hops
and
a
little
grass
a
pretty
mediocre
lager
relatively
bland
and
too
sweet
its
not
offensive
but
the
lack
of
hops
makes
it
not
worth
visiting
again
at
leat
for
me
smells
and
tastes
similar
to
a
macro
but
with
a
bit
more
hops
and
sweetness
from
the
malt
notes
of
light
grassy
hops
on
the
nose
and
palate
along
with
sweet
malt
and
an
unpleasant
metallic
taste
i
cant
recommend
this
one
but
its
nothing
awful
d
a
decent
drinker
this
was
a
piss
poor
lager
ive
had
cheap
macros
that
taste
better
than
this
not
worth
the
money
dont
waste
your
time
with
this
one
d
quite
drinkable
but
not
something
id
go
to
often
a
crowdpleasing
basic
lager
without
any
off
flavours
last
of
a
sixpack
brought
over
by
a
friend
a
couple
of
months
ago
although
not
a
lot
stands
out
in
this
beer
notable
items
for
the
style
at
least
around
here
are
a
lack
of
any
adjunct
flavours
and
b
a
really
solid
body
and
smooth
mouthfeel
other
than
that
a
good
straightforward
lighttasting
lager
thats
widely
available
in
toronto
and
therefore
often
a
good
option
next
to
the
macro
selections
taste
is
hoppier
than
expected
from
the
nose
which
is
a
pleasant
surprise
malt
is
subdued
and
wellbalanced
with
a
light
roasted
character
theres
a
nice
lemony
sourness
to
go
along

a

lager
a

above
national
macros
but
nothing

a

stab
at

other
similar

the
feel

quite
carbonated

no
real

overall
a
fairly
low

in
my
opinion
horrible

had
this
the
other
day
and
there
was
a
sulphur
quality
to
the
smell
and
the
flavour
that
was
very
unpleasant
dont
know
if
this
was
a
bad
can
or
not
and
will
reserve
judgement
but
if
this
is
the
case
the
smell
and
taste
ratings
should
be
dropped
by
about
0
5
as
this
seriously
detracts
from
an
otherwise
average
epl
o
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
fairly
generic
and
a
pretty
bad
aroma
but
its
okay
and
just
that
overall
why
bother
with
this
if
this
is
your
only
choice
for
a
beer
i
really
pity
you
o
drinkable
beer
a
good
lager
i
would
dare
to
say
light
and
crisp
goes
down
easy
if
you
want
a
pretty
boring
lager
this
will
serve
you
quite
well
better
than
heineken
or
whatever
i
dunno
its
hard
to
review
stuff
like
this
cool
can
though
which
is
how
i
got
here
in
the
first
place
i
was
kind
of
disappointed
with
this
one
final
grade
3
26
a
passable
c
o
yet
another
boring
danish
macro
beer
with
a
corny
overdose
overall
id
say
this
is
a
slightly
above
average
eurolager
there
is
nothing
offensive
about
it
and
its
pretty
drinkable
its
still
not
something
id
buy
again
however
overall
a
good
slightly
above
average
euro
pale
lager
likely
wont
get
you
excited
but
wont
disappoint
pours
a
clear
goldenyellow
colour
with
thin
white
head
smells
grainy
with
almost
a
hint
of
hops
flavour
is
quite
sweet
only
a
faint
hint
of
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
fairly
big
carbonation
level
probably
too
high
to
make
this
really
drinkable
clean
enough
flavour
nothing
off
just
an
ok
lager
overall
overall
i
dont
think
i
will
have
this
again
taste
isnt
good
and
is
quite
bland
this
is
a
beer
to
get
you
drunk
otherwise
i
dont
see
the
point
33
8
ounce
can
is
what
got
my
attention
with
a
cheap
price
that
should
have
been
my
warning
sign
there
oh
well
at
least
a
slight
buzz
has
landed
i
think
half
of
all
purchases
of
faxe
must
owe
to
the
novelty
of
the
gigantic
1liter
can
its
a
bit
of
a
budget
heineken
it
reminds
me
of
a
heineken
copycat
beer
whose
name
escapes
me
that
used
to
come
in
12packs
anyway
faxe
is
a
little
too
light
on
the
palate
thin
body
and
not
a
lot
of
flavor
that
said
not
a
bad
quaff
when
you
are
interested
in
volume
at
a
decent
price
drinkability
i
could
probably
nurse
one
of
these
for
hours
and
wouldnt
refuse
it
for
a
second
if
offered
under
any
circumstances
quite
nice
overall
d
i
got
this
as
a
gift
it
came
in
a
1000
ml
can
with
a
giant
mug
its
very
easy
to
drink
but
dont
drink
it
if
youre
looking
for
something
tasty
its
basically
like
a
american
macro
beer
but
i
think
i
might
prefer
this
over
most
american
macros
moral
of
the
story
decent
drinking
beer
have
it
with
meat
and
potatoes
cant
go
wrong
i
doubt
ill
be
drinking
this
again
nothing
special
and
odds
are
where
ever
you
are
youll
have
better
options
d
overall
this
was
a
hohum
experience
that
continued
to
get
more
tiresome
and
boring
with
every
sip
a
single
serving
would
be
a
struggle
and
waste
of
time
let
along
trying
to
consume
the
whole
liter
i
originally
bought
this
as
a
joke
with
regards
to
the
oversized
can
i
guess
the
joke
ended
up
on
me
not
worth
the
aluminum
its
packaged
in
a
big
pass
3
a
liter
isnt
bad
its
not
bad
for
the
style
either
drinkability
what
can
i
say
its
nothing
special
its
got
nothing
to
offend
and
nothing
to
write
home
about
id
pick
it
over
most
other
macros
brews
the
best
part
on
this
particular
occasion
was
the
1l
mug
it
came
with
d
this
is
probably
one
of
the
best
macros
i
have
had
the
malts
come
in
and
balance
of
the
graininess
with
is
nice
its
not
that
expensive
and
not
terrible
in
taste
a
good
go
to
macroinebriation
beer
an
barelyaverage
european
macro
lager
rendered
all
the
more
unimpressive
by
the
apparently
additivefree
nature
of
its
ingredient
list
increasingly
unpleasant
as
it
warms
the
deadeyed
sweetness
of
this
one
will
haunt
you
for
a
while
after
the
finish
i
guarantee
it
t
slight
pilsner
taste
but
very
smooth
far
better
than
an
american
macro
lager
slight
bitter
aftertaste
very
solid
even
if
nothing
is
spectacular
d
its
drinkable
but
its
just
an
average
brew
that
ill
occasionally
enjoy
overallnot
great
not
terrible
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
it
but
wouldnt
refuse
overall
nothing
premium
more
like
very
average
drinkability
not
bad
but
nothing
special
in
my
opinion
not
a
really
memorable
brew
but
i
wouldnt
outright
refuse
it
if
offered
drinkability
a
not
impressed
beer
in
the
style
pale
lager
the
can
is
damned
fun
though
my
pour
formed
a
fingers
worth
of
bubbly
bonewhite
head
with
low
retention
the
nose
had
the
everpresent
lagersweetness
leaving
no
doubt
as
to
what
i
was
drinking
the
color
was
a
beautiful
goldenyellow
with
nequality
clarity
the
mouthfeel
was
thintomedium
with
a
slightly
metallic
taste
on
the
tongue
the
finish
had
a
lager
sweetness
but
i
still
caught
that
metallic
taste
on
the
extreme
finish
oof
i
tried
this
beer
on
june

2008
after
purchasing
from
one
of
my
local
lcbo
outlets
the
beer
pours
a
translucent
dark
gold
with
some
reddish
hues
the
head
started
out
as
loose
and
bubbly
before
quickly
receding
to
a
thin
ring
the
aroma
was
very
grassy
with
nothing
else
notably
present
the
mouthfeel
was
mediumbodied
medium
carbonated
the
flavour
was
primarily
grainy
malt
with
a
little
peppery
spiciness

the
tongue

i
dont
really
recommend
this
beer
other
than
to
give
it

a
fierce
fighting
machine
but
this
beer
is
the
complete
opposite
weak
and
light
basically
i
found
this
beer
is
just
another
cheap
macro
to
get
biltzed
on
theres
nothing
interesting
about
this
beer
except
that
it
came
in
a
1
liter
can
thats
it
theres
no
way
i
would
touch
this
stuff
again
exp
050908
pale
yellow
clear
and
see
through
big
white
head
initially
carbonation
was
just
barely
there
but
it
stayed
throughout
minimal
lacing
as
the
glass
emptied
second
pour
brought
quite
a
bit
back
smells
a
bit
skunky
but
not
offensive
wet
grass
damp
basement
the
taste
is
bitter
mildly
hoppy
with
a
bit
of
malt
in
the
background
to
smooth
it
over
there
is
a
thin
body
and
dry
mouthfeel
this
is
quaffable
enough
although
a
little
gassy
overall
pretty
standard
fare
and
true
to
the
style
not
the
best
example
of
its
type
but
certainly
not
the
worst
either
overall
an
unimpressive
euro
lager
many
better
out
there
the
one
liter
can
was
pretty
cool
though
from
a
oneliter
can
this
is
a
decent
and
drinkable
lager
it
presents
a
nice
floral
hop
aroma
and
a
restrained
but
genuinely
pleasant
malt
backdrop
its
a
clear
goldenyellow
color
and
the
head
is
tall
and
firm
the
beer
is
clean
and
straightforward
its
also
satisfying
which
is
a
lot
more
than
can
be
said
for
other
european
lagers
the
finish
has
a
little
hop
bitterness
but
could
have
carried
a
little
more
flavor
its
an
okay
brew
also
the
can
is
perfect
for
a
one
liter
mug
a
nice
deep
chapagne
color
and
beige
head
top
off
this
beer
as
the
large
frothy
head
settles
into
a
constant
3
finger
state
the
aroma
of
the
beer
hints
of
fruits
and
hops
and
the
taste
is
of
mostly
malty
but
also
some
hoppy
notes
the
5
abv
is
barely
noticeable
behind
this
as
it
is
drinkable
the
only
problem
is
there
is
no
backbone
in
the
beer
there
is
taste
on
the
front
end
of
it
but
barely
any
on
the
back
end
an
average
beer
at
best
imo
nothing
to
go
out
of
your
way
for
a
decent
euro
lager
one
that
is
easy
to
drink
and
might
be
killer
on
tap
would
certainly
be
a
good
entry
beer
for
someone
unfamilar
with
euro
lagers
ie
molson
canadian
drinker
not
bad
at
all
for
the
style
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
sure
beats
many
other
eurolagers
as
far
as
taste
would
make
a
nice
summer
no
brainer
but
tasty
enough
refresher
good
enough
to
wonder
if
this
comes
in
a
keg
for
a
summer
barbecue
brilliant
pale
yellow
with
a
big
frothy
white
head
that
quickly
diminishes
the
smell
is
a
pleasant
sweet
grainy
malt
with
a
hint
of
floral
hops
this
faxe
danish
lager
out
of
the
1l
can
is
light
bodied
and
has
a
low
carbonation
that
gives
it
a
smooth
mouthfeel
the
taste
is
light
and
balances
the
dominant
pale
malt
with
a
very
very
slightly
bittermettalic
finish
overall
a
beer
that
is
easy
to
drink
and
surprisingly
light
tasting
for
a
5
5
abv
clean
wellbrewed
euro
lager
nice
golden
color
average
head
retention
floral
and
herbal
hops
in
the
nose
with
a
touch
of
grainy
malt
nice
lightly
sweet
just
slightly
tart
malt
base
because
of
ph
from
yeast
and
fermentation
not
infection
solid
bitterness
really
nice
balance
clean
drinkable
refreshing
and
ok
the
bigassed
can
is
kind
of
cool
needless
to
say
i
up
ended
the
huge
can
into
the
sink
and
looked
for
something
else
in
the
fridge
taste
is
not
unpleasant
the
same
juicy
sweetness
is
in
evidence
apples
pears
slightly
nutty
malt
backbone
with
a
citric
acidity
nothing
mindblowing
here
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
and
watery
but
isnt
overcarbonated
nice
alcohol
warmth
on
the
way
down
but
the
thinner
body
really
makes
this
a
chugger
i
guess
if
i
had
a
lawn
id
call
this
a
lawnmower
beer
sampled
on
a
hot
summer
day
which
was
in
its
favour
dull
yellow
in
appearence
no
real
head
no
aroma
probably
a
good
thing
light
hops
with
underlying
malt
in
the
flavour
carbonation
was
at
a
good
level
but
flavour
was
flat
clearly
macro
decent
quencher
could
never
be
much
more
i
cant
say
i
didnt
enjoy
it
it
was
fair
enough
but
i
wouldnt
recommend
buying
unless
to
cook
with
it
best
part
is
the
viking
on
the
can
d
looks
good
feels
good
but
i
cant
get
past
the
taste
the
remainder
of
this
beer
wound
up
in
a
pile
of
gravel
as
soon
as
i
got
through
the
rating
i
give
it
12
point
extra
for
luring
me
into
tasting
it
a
nice
euro
pale
pours
out
to
a
medium
golden
orange
color
with
a
short
livedwhite
foam
head
no
lace
medium
to
medium
low
levels
of
carbonation
aromas
of
buttery
malts
and
sweet
fermented
grain
dominate
with
traces
of
biscuits
and
yeast
taste
is
enjoyable
mildy
buttery
malts
raw
grain
sweet
bread
and
light
rye
with
a
touch
of
light
smoke
mouthfeel
is
smooth
with
a
touch
of
bubbliness
on
the
tongue
drinkability
is
pretty
good
id
have
this
again
worth
a
try
ah
faxe
had
this
a
few
years
ago
while
in
denmark
digging
up
dead
vikings
i
feel
the
same
way
about
it
now
as
i
did
then
its
okay
enough
looking
golden
with
some
head
smell
is
practically
nonexistent
a
bit
of
sweetness
but
you
have
to
sniff
really
really
hard
taste
is
watery
in
fact
it
tastes
like
water
with
a
shot
of
beer
in
it
barely
hoppy
barely
tasty
mouthfeel
is
watery
and
thin
i
could
certainly
keep
drinking
this
yes
the
litre
if
it
was
kept
cold
and
it
does
have
some
interesting
danish
memories
attached
but
i
will
not
be
going
after
this
again
any
time
soon
still
a
litre
that
doesnt
taste
like
crap
and
is
cheap
college
kids
get
this
instead
of
bud
unexciting
uninteresting
just
big
and
kinda
cheap
frat
boys
are
likely
to
be
all
over
this
stuff
canned
sample
gold
in
colour
with
strong
carbonation
light
malt
aromas
with
a
very
mild
of
a
floral
note
some
grainy
sweetness
in
the
mouth
with
some
chemical
astringency
a
bit
more
full
bodied
than
others
of
this
style
poor
dirty
water
kind
of
finish
overall
it
smells
better
than
it
tastes
not
recommended
mouthfeeldrinkability
surprisingly
good
texture
but
to
no
avail
this
beer
can
not
be
saved
from
the
depths
of
my
kitchen
sinks
drain
the
most
offensive
beer
i
have
yet
to
review
pale
beer
with
faint
aroma
produces
fluffy
unstable
head
taste
is
thin
sweetish
with
obviously
no
character
malts
are
present
hops
are
absent
finish
is
bittersour
cheap
beer
designed
for
mass
consummation
at
all
kind
of
fests
and
other
big
gatherings
other
ceres
products
are
much
more
interesting
d
surprisingly
ok
exceeded
my
expectations
after
the
extra
strong
10
blech
this
is
worth
a
try
if
you
like
euro
lagers
otherwise
it
doesnt
offer
much
too
watery
and
dms
is
present
the
bottom
line
is
why
would
i
pay
premium
import
price
to
drink
this
when
i
can
enjoy
a
domestic
macro
like
molson
canadian
for
less
money
overall
its
an
okay
not
to
heavy
and
not
overly
light
its
very
similar
to
castle
lager
in
terms
of
aftertaste
nothing
really
special
here
fairly
run
of
the
mill
but
it
just
has
a
couple
of
qualities
in
each
area
that
turns
me
off
slightly
so
that
it
doesnt
get
average
marks
even
though
its
a
thoroughly
average
euro
pale
lager
pours
a
clear
ambergold
fluffy
white
head
forms
laces
well
and
has
good
retention
smell
is
sweet
and
malty
honey
citrus
some
floral
hops
quite
pleasant
taste
is
sweet
and
malty
lots
of
citrus
and
floral
mild
bitterness
in
the
fnish
mouthfeel
is
surprisingly
thick
medium
bodied
with
medium
to
low
carbonation
not
bad
at
all
the
taste
is
an
open
lager
palate
with
banana
tones
initially
followed
by
a
not
as
nice
metallic
touch
to
the
tongue
still
this
is
not
some
sloppy
euro
lager
with
no
self
respect
some
discipline
here
in
the
crafting
keeps
this
to
decent
levels
of
drinkability
a
bit
of
tartness
or
clove
keeps
the
house
in
order
and
this
is
drinkable
stuff
although
downing
a
full
litre
can
will
take
a
little
while
better
than
i
expected
if
not
a
real
superstar
features
a
pure
white
head
sitting
atop
clear
goldenyellow
liquid
gentle
carbonation
pleasant
nose
with
aromas
of
grassy
and
lemony
maltiness
sharp
hoppiness
the
taste
is
bittersweet
with
a
great
balance
malttohop
and
a
nice
long
bright
hop
finish
with
just
a
slight
adjunct
note
but
not
strong
enough
to
distract
from
the
enjoyability
fairly
easy
to
drink
to
the
lightness
fo
the
brew
but
still
slightly
overcarbonated
for
my
taste
you
could
easily
polish
off
three
or
four
of
these
before
it
begins
to
burn
the
back
of
your
throat
can
poured
a
bright
golden
color
lager
with
a
medium
lightly
foamy
white
head
with
better
then
average
retention
aroma
of
light
floral
malt
is
quite
evident
taste
is
refreshing
with
a
nice
dose
of
malt
but
sadly
lacking
hops
resulting
in
a
thin
watery
finish
overall
this
is
just
a
slightly
above
average
premium
lager
a
bit
fizzy
going
down
but
i
find
most
lagers
are
easy
to
drink
a
good
session
beer
best
served
cold
poured
a
clear
greenish
gold
under
a
thin
onefinger
white
head
that
faded
faster
than
water
freezes
in
moscow
in
early
january
theres
a
bit
of
malt
in
the
nose
plus
a
touch
of
sweet
fruitiness
the
mouth
is
light
and
very
prickly
the
taste
well
there
isnt
much
a
bit
like
rusty
pipes
with
a
note
of
sweet
malt
theres
a
touch
of
hops
in
the
finish
but
hardly
worth
noting
this
isnt
a
drain
pour
but
it
sure
wont
be
followed
by
another
of
its
ilk
i
found
this
beer
about
average
maybe
a
little
higher
than
average
for
a
lager
i
believe
a
lover
of
coors
miller
or
bud
would
adore
this
beer
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
lager
but
i
will
probably
pull
one
from
the
fridge
and
have
a
big
cold
one
following
a
hot
day
under
the
summer
sun
came
in
a
500ml
can
with
a
freshness
date
stamped
on
the
bottom
pours
out
a
nice
clear
golden
hue
with
a
bit
of
a
head
that
immediately
fizzles
out
like
a
spent
firecracker
not
much
of
a
nose
to
detect
taste
is
of
grainy
sweet
malt
hops
are
oh
so
faint
as
if
theyre
hiding
it
goes
down
smooth
though
an
uninspiring
lager
but
its
drinkable
a
malty
smell
without
any
trace
of
hop
bitterness
a
very
bland
taste
and
relatively
low
in
carbonation
for
a
lager
the
taste
is
also
a
little
too
sweet
below
average
everything
about
this
lager
is
average
and
i
can
appreciate
that
flavorful
lager
from
denmark
worthy
of
an
above
average
rating
for
a
lager
tasty
and
refreshing
with
no
objectionable
after
tastes
or
smells
if
your
belly
or
wife
permits
you
can
easily
drink
massive
quantities
of
this
obviously
a
great
world
wide
rebound
beer
nice
amber
look
and
pleasant
feel
however
i
have
always
found
this
beer
to
be
a
litter
bitter
as
with
stella
this
is
one
of
the
first
beers
that
got
me
in
the
door
to
appreciating
beer
so
it
will
always
be
one
of
my
favorites
i
personally
would
give
it
a
4
5
with
stella
however
it
is
much
better
on
tap
than
in
the
bottle
and
there
arent
very
many
places
around
here
that
have
heineken
on
tap
my
go
to
cheap
beer
beer
without
any
interest
just
made
for
people
who
wants
to
drink
something
fresh
or
for
parties
excellent
taste
very
crisp
and
distinctive
must
drink
8
to
enjoy
full
effect
ive
had
this
beer
several
times
and
it
almost
always
comes
skunked
i
have
no
clue
why
this
overpriced
crap
is
so
popular
its
the
budweiser
of
europe
i
have
no
clue
why
people
here
in
america
think
its
in
any
way
a
fancy
beer
smooth
dry
cracker
taste
the
hops
are
nice
and
peppery
on
the
tongue
excellent
anytime
beer
have
not
had
one
of
these
in
years
i
cant
believe
i
actually
used
to
drink
this
stuff
bland
thin
and
watery
wont
be
buying
again
nothing
special
average
lager
beer
cant
beat
heinekens
taste
when
very
cold
skunked
every
bottle
i
have
ever
had
tasted
like
this
onefriggin
skunked
i
personally
dont
like
it
very
average
beer
is
all
i
have
to
say
served
in
a
pilsner
glass
one
of
my
favorite
gotos
thats
all
there
is
to
it
smooth
and
foreign
my
first
favorite
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
taste
good
but
still
not
the
perfect
one
another
lite
beer
with
a
little
floralspice
ok
very
bland
beer
with
a
watered
down
taste
good
beer
slightly
more
bitter
than
the
average
but
a
clean
crisp
taste
very
refreshing
dont
want
to
review
just
my
opinion
great
taste
to
begin
with
fresh
hoppy
and
a
nice
bitterness
although
for
me
it
goes
flat
rather
quickly
and
the
taste
then
becomes
sickly
i
am
referring
to
bottles
bought
in
the
uk
i
dont
know
if
the
us
version
is
different
love
the
skunkiness
always
will
too
bland
for
my
liking
very
mild
flavor
and
watery
body
i
really
dont
like
heineken
for
regular
drinking
i
get
some
at
my
friends
house
who
thinks
this
is
the
best
beer
available
from
watching
too
much
tv
decent
lager
good
in
the
summer
one
of
the
better
big
name
lagers
you
can
get
for
those
who
have
never
tried
a
word
of
advice
on
tap
its
best
in
a
kegmini
keg
its
also
great
in
a
can
its
often
gone
sour
and
in
bottles
you
can
have
a
hit
or
miss
experience
ive
rated
it
based
on
tap
and
keg
performance
one
of
the
better
big
brewery
offerings
it
has
a
light
bitterness
light
body
and
a
subtle
background
biscuit
sweetness
enjoyable
and
refreshing
beer
for
everyman
and
the
first
step
into
the
euro
import
market
much
better
than
any
american
adjuncts
but
pales
in
comparison
to
its
pilsner
competitors
standard
lager
nothing
offensive
or
inoffensive
about
it
so
skunky
ive
tried
it
half
a
dozen
times
just
bad
ive
heard
its
totally
different
fresh
looks
okay
smells
good
and
very
smooth
to
drink
is
better
than
other
domestic
out
there
23
work
event
drank
a
lot
while
i
was
younger
decent
beer
overall
3
0
a
throwback
from
the
past
this
one
usually
has
a
skunky
smell
that
greets
you
once
you
pop
the
cap
built
for
college
kids
this
is
just
a
watery
mess
that
somehow
has
a
massive
advertising
budget
to
keep
it
afloat
it
an
ok
beer
but
why
pay
more
for
this
when
you
can
drink
bud
or
coors
for
cheaper
good
lager
thats
often
skunky
better
in
the
canned
version
and
always
stands
out
with
its
german
malt
flavor
a
good
solid
commercial
import
used
to
drink
this
somewhat
regularly
before
the
craft
revolution
i
personally
like
the
skunky
smell
in
a
beer
but
this
is
too
intense
other
than
that
overall
this
is
a
drinkable
but
very
bland
beer
mild
beer
a
bit
skunky
something
to
get
if
youre
not
really
into
beers
its
a
classic
beer
when
you
got
nothing
else
its
my
favorite
skunked
beer
poured
into
a
500ml
paulaner
glass
from
a
pint
can
no
green
glass
issue
with
the
can
1
finger
head
yellow
appearance
and
smell
is
what
you
would
expect
a
little
malt
but
not
much
more
taste
is
refreshing
and
goes
down
easily
when
i
need
a
break
from
the
ipa
and
imperial
stouts
this
is
still
a
solid
choice
and
at
5
for
a
4
pack
of
pints
it
is
half
the
price
of
my
sunking
addiction
this
beer
has
a
tremendous
sentimental
value
to
me
growing
up
in
former
soviet
union
this
was
the
first
foreign
beer
i
tasted
still
a
solid
brew
to
me
after
all
these
years
of
having
the
amazing
american
brews
the
best
in
the
world
heineken
is
something
i
return
to
every
now
and
then
to
remind
myself
about
the
journey
that
ive
taken
as
a
beer
drinker
this
was
the
first
brew
that
i
ever
sampled
on
draught
in
holland
in
fact
i
was
all
of
15
years
old
and
no
one
batted
an
eyelash
when
i
ordered
up
my
first
glass
ahh
europe
well
decades
later
i
picked
up
a
6pack
at
a
local
gas
station
and
was
a
bit
disappointed
that
they
have
departed
from
their
signature
stubby
bottles
in
favor
of
a
more
generic
looking
longneck
i
had
no
plans
to
actually
review
this
beer
so
i
never
even
poured
it
in
to
a
glass
even
so
the
bottle
still
emanated
that
familiar
sulfurous
skunk
aroma
ive
come
to
actually
enjoy
that
lightstruck
lager
scent
there
isnt
much
else
to
the
nose
maybe
a
little
corn
sweetness
in
the
flavor
department
i
was
a
little
disappointed
its
been
awhile
since
ive
had
a
heineken
but
i
seem
to
recall
that
it
had
more
pop
to
it
with
that
euro
pale
lager
funk
this
rendition
was
very
light
on
flavor
smooth
crisp
slightly
drying
with
just
a
hint
of
dankness
it
was
so
much
cleaner
and
less
controversial
than
i
recalled
watery
with
fizzy
carbonation
and
popcornlike
hints
of
adjuncts
in
the
finish
i
was
able
to
crush
that
6pack
without
any
problem
in
fact
when
i
was
done
i
wondered
what
happened
if
not
for
the
buzz
i
couldnt
be
sure
that
i
even
had
any
beer
at
all
still
theres
nothing
to
complain
about
here
i
only
wish
there
was
a
little
more
of
that
aroma
and
flavor
that
has
come
to
define
heineken
in
the
us
this
was
so
mild
that
it
really
gets
lost
in
the
lager
mix
better
than
bud
or
coors
but
not
much
this
is
a
world
class
beer
not
my
first
love
but
taste
buds
have
grown
towards
other
flavors
lol
very
bland
over
priced
lager
actually
it
tastes
in
holland
as
draft
drastically
different
from
us
bottles
my
gringo
friend
when
he
tried
it
in
amsterdam
brewery
said
wow
if
this
beer
would
taste
in
us
like
that
he
would
be
drinking
just
heineken
all
day
long
may
be
pasteurization
kills
the
bottle
taste
in
holland
they
use
premium
a1
yeast
strain
and
that
what
makes
this
beer
very
interesting
plus
a
tradition
your
average
euro
pale
lager
nothing
special
here
some
sentimental
value
for
me
since
this
was
the
first
beer
i
ever
finished
alone
but
thats
pretty
much
it
folks
a
telltale
tinge
of
lemon
in
the
first
sip
but
thats
probably
just
me
and
my
oversensitive
palate
nothing
special
just
a
nice
lager
enjoyable
drinkable
nothing
special
i
always
consider
this
beer
an
american
pale
lager
with
an
attitude
purchased
at
the
lcbo
for
2
70
in
a
500
ml
can
much
better
options
out
there
for
a
cheaper
price
and
thats
really
my
biggest
concern
wouldnt
drink
this
farmers
piss
skunk
flavor
smell
from
the
light
spoiling
the
drink
inside
the
green
bottles
i
was
thrown
off
with
a
strange
taste
way
better
out
of
the
can
in
summertime
the
bottles
are
usually
skunky
unbelievable
highgrade
drinking
beer
on
the
expensive
side
a
5
pilsner
lager
with
a
faint
but
crisp
hops
aftertaste
eurobud
basically
goto
pilsener
for
me
probably
not
a
huge
surprise
as
this
is
by
far
the
most
sold
and
served
beer
in
holland
heineken
is
quite
good
but
not
special
in
any
sense
of
the
word
of
course
as
a
macro
produced
pilsener
this
is
not
the
best
beer
in
the
world
but
in
my
opinion
it
doesnt
deserve
the
hate
it
often
gets
this
just
tastes
pretty
bad
green
bottles
should
be
a
big
enough
red
light
it
was
all
that
was
in
the
fridge
at
a
party
lol
wheres
my
pbr
really
nice
beer
in
comparison
to
other
production
beers
taste
was
alright
but
didnt
like
the
lingering
taste
i
had
a
bottle
of
this
at
a
diner
on
my
way
back
from
lancaster
pa
this
evening
the
place
didnt
have
anything
on
tap
and
all
their
domestics
were
lousy
aals
what
hit
me
right
away
when
i
grabbed
the
bottle
was
the
very
strong
skunky
odor
the
appearance
of
the
brew
matches
other
euro
pales
ive
had
the
taste
is
mild
with
a
nasty
edge
of
skunk
on
the
back
end
moderate
carbonation
is
prominent
on
the
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
passable
beer
but
not
much
more
than
that
if
i
am
going
to
drink
a
euro
lager
ill
go
with
peroni
or
stella
solid
beer
but
nothing
to
brag
about
i
could
swear
that
back
in
the
80s
and
in
europe
this
was
a
great
tasting
beer
but
what
you
can
get
now
just
doesnt
live
up
to
the
memory
the
taste
is
a
quite
distinctive
yeast
flavor
with
a
tiny
hint
of
hops
crisp
and
smooth
it
goes
down
easy
the
aftertaste
is
clean
and
refreshing
my
all
time
favorite
beer
great
beer
the
taste
is
a
quite
distinctive
yeast
flavor
with
a
tiny
hint
of
hops
crisp
and
smooth
it
goes
down
easy
the
aftertaste
is
clean
and
refreshing
for
a
pale
lager
beats
budweiser
or
any
bmc
macro
really
beyond
that
not
better
than
my
craft
beers
but
for
mass
produced
beer
this
is
a
good
offering
can
skunk
though
be
a
good
idea
to
get
this
one
fresh
if
you
can
kegs
would
be
best
option
we
have
all
had
one
its
okay
but
wouldnt
write
home
about
it
nose
is
not
for
me
overall
its
completely
drinkable
but
theres
just
not
much
flavor
to
it
i
dont
think
its
as
bad
as
many
people
seem
to
think
because
there
are
no
out
and
out
bad
flavors
to
it
but
theres
not
really
much
of
a
good
flavor
to
it
either
this
is
not
a
good
beer
but
its
a
drinkable
beer
it
hits
the
mark
for
what
it
tries
to
be
props
for
sticking
to
your
guns
it
never
ceases
to
amaze
me
that
the
normal
flavor
profile
of
this
beer
is
skunklike
im
not
sure
if
it
is
the
ingredients
the
brewing
process
the
storage
process
or
the
green
glass
bottles
but
i
have
experienced
the
same
thing
each
time
i
have
sampled
it
over
the
years
although
not
bad
it
is
a
forgettable
beer
to
me
this
is
a
budget
lager
i
normally
would
only
buy
this
if
i
was
low
on
money
nevertheless
it
isnt
a
bad
choice
i
am
neutral
on
this
beer
good

the

the

if

and
grab
a

thats

it
can
provide
a
halfway
decent
beer
i
like

lager
and
pilsners
but
this
is
just
ok
smell
a
little
skunky
even
from

go
down

shore
every
summer
and
pound
these
green
grenades
on
the
pier
away
from
the
lights
with
my
cousin
ronny
now
i
dont
know
a
ton
about
beer
but
any
beer
thats
light
and
airy
enough
for
a
14
year
old
to
kill
9
of
in
a
single
sitting
is
doing
something
right
shortly
after
i
moved
on
to
harder
stuff
for
a
while
but
rediscovered
the
joy
and
memories
of
that
slender
green
bottle
when
i
got
a
couple
years
older
and
started
hitting
the
clubs
word
to
the
wise
no
girl
doesnt
like
a
good
heineken
so
that
puts
it
pretty
high
on
my
list
heineken
the
budweiser
of
the
netherlands
a
classic
beer
that
is
a
no
brainer
to
enjoy
pours
a
light
yellow
with
a
good
head
this
is
a
flavorful
lager
that
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
i
find
heineken
to
be
a
pleasant
tasting
brew
one
that
ranks
among
the
best
imported
beers
ive
had
ive
had
better
beers
but
heineken
is
a
classic
and
refreshing
beer
i
grew
up
drinking
this
beer
so
its
only
natural
that
i
love
it
the
way
i
do
smooth
and
crisp
slightly
bitter
a
dutch
classic
yuk
bouquet
skunky
if
youre
looking
to
get
a
big
headache
drink
this
o
an
odd
euro
lager
it
is
not
straight
down
the
line
for
the
style
as
there
is
more
sweetness
in
this
than
i
would
be
used
to
or
even
expect
that
aside
this
beer
is
more
than
drinkable
and
certainly
deserves
a
higher
rating
than
it
is
presently
enjoying
is
this
super
exciting
no
is
it
worth
the
heavy
imported
price
in
the
usa
no
are
there
better
dutch
lagers
out
there
yes
but
is
it
drinkable
and
even
enjoyable
in
the
right
circumstance
and
setting
yes
most
definitely
the
greatest
in
the
world
but
its
way
ahead
of
a
bud
is
it
great
of
course
not
but
i
think
it
deserves
a
higher
score
than
it
gets
here
a
pure
malt
beer
honest
without
chemical
additives
do
not
know
much
about
beer
im
starting
to
take
now
but
for
me
it
is
one
of
the
best
costbenefit
in
brazil
at
least
inside
where
craft
are
hard
to
reach
enough
corn
beer
for
what
you
pay
to
drink
this
we
should
expect
more
i
like
it
ok
at
best
but
for
this
price
you
are
better
off
going
elsewhere
consistently
skunky
headache
will
accompany
pure
skunk
piss
average
beer
very
overrated
rather
drink
pabst
anytime
not
great
sometimes
its
the
best
of
a
bad
bunch
just
another
commercial
beer
lovely
refreshing
beer
would
highly
recommend
to
any
beer
lover
so
would
i
recommend
it
from
my
point
of
view
no
i
mean
it
depends
on
your
taste
its
not
bad
but
you
can
get
much
much
better
for
the
same
price
271
underrated
it
is
one
of
the
best
international
lagers
soft
and
tasteful
overall
this
was
from
a
24
oz
can
so
the
typical
skunk
taste
was
absent
however
there
was
a
fair
share
of
tootsie
roll
aroma
and
maybe
even
taste
perhaps
my
palate
was
wrecked
i
dont
know
i
dont
like
when
people
give
heineken
a
bad
rap
and
continue
to
promote
other
lagers
full
of
garbage
preservatives
and
additives
but
everyone
is
entitled
to
their
opinion
thats
what
reviews
are
for
not
the
best
gmo
free
beer
but
its
good
and
has
good
availability
i
would
choose
amstel
over
it
but
i
enjoy
it
i
like
its
fizz
smell
isnt
great
but
it
really
doesnt
taste
like
it
smells
good
for
any
occasion
really
but
once
the
temp
raises
its
awful
from
what
i
see
people
here
give
really
negative
reviews
for
this
beer
i
dont
know
maybe
worse
batch
in
my
humble
opinion
this
is
basically
the
best
quick
lager
beer
you
can
get
on
the
market
wanna
have
a
quick
light
beer
this
is
the
perfect
choice
ill
choose
it
over
any
other
lager
for
a
casual
talk
with
friends
the
taste
is
really
good
cooled
down
it
doesnt
smell
terribly
bad
and
has
an
okay
color
in
my
opinion
this
is
the
worst
beer
on
the
market
today
or
i
should
say
the
american
heineken
is
the
worst
apparently
if
you
get
it
in
europe
it
is
way
better
but
i
have
yet
to
see
it
was
near
clear
with
a
little
fiz
the
smell
was
skunky
as
was
the
taste
with
a
bad
lingering
aftertaste
its
one
of
the
most
popular
beers
in
america
and
i
just
dont
understand
why
overall
a
good
beer
in
my
opinion
would
be
a
good
one
to
have
while
setting
by
the
pool
or
on
the
beach
really
refreshing
this
beer
was
an
ok
beer
i
liked
the
smell
of
this
beer
and
the
taste
of
it
was
not
all
that
bad
the
aroma
of
this
beer
was
not
all
that
bad
as
well
i
liked
the
golden
color
of
this
beer
it
did
not
have
a
strong
taste
to
it
which
was
actually
pretty
good
the
smell
of
this
beer
was
pretty
good
as
well
i
know
that
i
enjoyed
this
beer
will
not
seek
out
purchase
or
even
drink
again
overall
3

lagers
are
lagers
and
this
one
is
one
of
the
best
which
isnt
saying
much
its
always
trendy
to
slam
the
megabrews
but
there
is
a
reason
heineken
is
one
of
the
worlds
most
popular
its
actually
pretty
good
excellent
with
all
food
types

you
know
what
youre
getting
with
this
one
it
looks
nice
but
a
relatively
light
lager
like
heineken
is
good
for
a
sunny
day
at
the
beech
for
a
refreshing
thirst
quencher
i
like
this
beer
and
compare
it
to
tsing
tao
in
overall
character
im
not
a
hop
nut
i
like
a
good

ive
tried
my
best
to
leave
any
beer
snobbery
out
of
this
i
would
not
seek
this
beer
out
in
the
future
im
not
sure
why
it
is
so
popular
and
world
renowned
then
again
why
are
any
macrolagers
so
popular
but
its
not
the
worst
beer
ive
tasted
jamesmnjul
26
but
its
not
the
worst
either
avoid
the
green
bottle
and
the
experience
should
be
a
little
better
a
good
beer
for
parties
i
had
also
stopped
by
at
a
local
pub
and
have
had
this
on
tap
this
beer
is
actually
a
decent
beer
it
is
not
paulaner
or
spaten

i
would
bet
if
they
switched
to
a
brown
bottle
and
eliminated
the
skunkiness
this
would
be
a

beer
from

otherwise
its
just

its
really
not

i
cant

i
would
ever
purchase
it
in
the
stores
it
looks
like
any
other
common
beer
out
there
and
doesnt
really
have
a
uniqe
taste
i
think
the
average
person
considers
this
some
special
high
quality
beer

it
really
does
not

are

but
where
it
is
its
fine
but
i
have
no
idea
why
anyone
would
buy
this
beer
when
there
are
so
many

around

has

pretty

in

its

though
with
so
many

the

is
why
would
you

drinkability
is
there
its
very
easy
to
down
and
barely
noticeable
in
all
facets
with
that
said
i
have
a
feeling
the
next
time
i
set
up
my
beer
pong
table
i
may
be
buying
a
case
of
heinies
then
again
i
probably
wont
one
of
the
most
popular
beers
in
the
world
for
a
reason
there
is
nothing
great
about
this
beer
but
you
also
can
not
go
wrong
with
it
you
will
run
into
this
beer
at
any
local
grocer
or
gas
station
next
to
budweiser
and
coors
but
that
doesnt
mean
its
terrible
pretty
much
anyone
on
this
site
has
probably
had
a
heineken
at
some
point
dalthough
not
the
greatest
beer
it
is
still
heavily
drinkable
and
heavily
available
drinks
about
as
good
as
any
macro
way
too
expensive
and
not
worth
it
imho
the
one
attribute
that
i
detect
in
heineken
is
a
delicious
feeling
and
taste
of
clean
water
why
would
any
drink
beer
just
to
taste
water
beats
me
but
whenever
i
drink
heineken
i
think
of
ice
cold
artesian
water
and
that
just
makes
the
beer
completely
worth
buying
its
just
something
about
the
extreme
crispiness
of
the
carbonation
when
its
served
cold
that
ive
never
found
in
any
other
beer
ive
ever
drank
while
this
is
by
no
stretch
of
the
truth
a
good
beer
in
my
opinion
i
would
gladly
replace
all
the
budweiser
and
millercoors
in
the
world
with
it
d
quite
but
since
theres
not
much
going
on
here
its
not
an
experience
i
particularly
enjoy
d
it
is
what
it
is
a
relatively
drinkable
beer
its
light
and
refreshing
especially
on
a
hot
day
i
swear
every
time
i
drink
this
brew
is
like
drinking
a
rose
garden
quite
floral
for
a
beer
must
be
the
hops
always
a
good
session
and
you
get
used
to
the
brew
quickly
tops
my
favorites
despite
the
grade
given
the
choice
between
similar
usa
commercial
brands
and
im
up
on
the
fence
it
depends
on
the
mood
your
in
so
go
ahead
enjoy

the
timing
is
right

quickly

mouthfeel

a

drinkability
is
high
on
this
beer
as
there
isnt
much
body
hop
presence
or
alchohol
not
that
i
would
want
to
buy
and
drink
this
simple
lager
often
d
would
drink
if
i
was
forced
to
its
better
than
a
miller
lite
but
thats
not
saying
much
i
think
people
just
order
this
to
be
cool
dvery
drinkable
imo
some
people
dont
like
it
because
they
think
its
too
skunky
im
in
the
age
range
where
people
rate
beers
on
how
fast
they
can
drink
them
i
always
take
my
time
and
enjoy
heineken
thoughone
of
my
all
time
favorites
when
served
right
ive
been
to
some
bars
where
they
dont
sell
enough
and
it
gets
old
and
loses
some
of
its
edge
but
thats
only
sometimes
d
a
relatively
drinkable
beer
would
be
a
lot
better
if
i
could
get
over
the
mouthfeel
all
the
same
its
light
and
refreshing
basically
exactly
what
it
purports
to
me
basically
a
slightly
upscale
mass
produced
light
lager
12
oz
bottle
i
had
to
order
this
beer
because
the
place
was
out
of
brooklyn
lager
pours
golden
with
a
white
lacy
strange
head
aroma
is
of
some
grass
not
much
else
taste
is
sweet
grain
dough
and
some
earthy
hops
at
least
it
was
not
disgusting
the
beer
goes
down
rather
easy
and
has
a
bit
of
a
spicy
mouthfeel
with
nice
carb
for
a
pale
lager
it
is
subpar
but
it
is
better
than
just
about
any
adjunct
this
thin
body
beer
has
a
dull
bitterness
which
is
surprisingly
not
as
skunky
as
it
smells
the
character
of
this
beer
is
kind
of
like
old
knockoff
brand
cereal
like
if
you
left
a
storebrand
version
of
cheerios
in
your
pantry
for
several
months
and
then
decided
to
grind
the
box
up
and
drink
it
horrible
raw
grain
taste
with
a
short
chemical
aftertaste
honestly
why
make
a
beer
that
smells
and
tastes
like
this
served
in
a
pint
glass
pours
is
a
clear
golden
color
with
plenty
of
visible
carbonation
and
a
white
head
the
nose
is
quite
a
bit
of
skunked
hops
plus
some
grain
the
hops
are
definitely
skunked
and
a
bit
grassy
some
very
light
grain
skunky
hops
somehow
fit
this
brew
like
they
dont
with
any
other
maybe
im
just
used
to
it
really
not
all
the
great
crisp
and
light
i
really
dont
like
this
and
cant
suffer
through
it
any
longer
d
undrinkable
drain
pour
thin
watery
and
skunky
dont
waste
money
on
this
only
drink
if
you
are
already
drunk
and
its
offered
free
even
then
be
prepared
and
approach
with
caution
ok
poured
out
of
a
keg
can
and
all
i
can
say
is
heineken
fck
that
sht
pabst
blue
ribbon
anyways
it
looks
pretty
damn
boring
pale
straw
yellow
but
pretty
effervescent
i
actually
do
see
some
very
slight
lacing
i
bought
the
can
to
avoid
the
skunk
but
i
swear
did
they
make
this
one
purposely
skunky
as
well
i
am
either
already
drunk
or
i
am
smelling
some
off
skunk
smells
along
with
some
hay
sweet
corn
adjuncts
and
a
tinge
of
some
noble
hops
hmm
taste
is
somewhat
dry
some
euro
pale
maltyness
is
the
middle
actually
finished
very
clean
ok
so
i
cheated
heineken
is
saying
they
only
use
malted
barley
i
swear
this
beer
does
have
a
residual
corniness
to
it
i
dont
know
something
isnt
quite
right
i
think
this
one
is
pasteurized
cause
although
it
is
slightly
drinkable
and
ok
it
still
just
kinda
tastes
canned
too
bad
cause
i
would
love
to
try
one
of
these
in
amsterdam
fresh
unpasteurized
drink
eh
if
it
was
free
and
already
drunk
was
at
a
restaurant
and
there
was
nothing
better
to
get
i
havent
had
heineken
in
a
long
time
so
i
decided
to
see
if
it
was
how
i
remembered
poured
a
clear
pale
yellow
with
a
finger
of
white
head
with
no
lacing
smells
mostly
of
grains
no
real
hops
no
bitterness
at
all
really
im
glad
this
bottle
wasnt
skunked
so
it
tasted
clean
just
almost
no
flavour
carbonation
was
way
too
high
it
is
what
it
is
soso
euro
style
lager
not
great
not
bad
not
something
i
would
seek
out
to
drink
just
for
itself
but
it
compliments
some
food
okay
d
very
easy
to
drink
just
not
much
there
i
do
recommend
this
beer
however
there
are
many
out
there
that
are
so
much
better
and
so
much
cheaper
i
will
be
getting
the
draughtkeg
again
though
d
easy
to
drink
if
youre
looking
to
get
drunk
because
of
its
watery
texture
nothing
much
else
to
it
if
my
only
options
were
the
bmcs
of
the
beer
world
and
this
i
would
definitely
reach
for
a
heineken
lager
beer
pours
a
deep
yellow
piss
color
with
a
thick
nasty
looking
head
and
zero
lacing
smells
like
corn
and
barley
some
apparent
sweetness
tastes
much
the
same
a
little
corn
and
a
little
grain
maybe
some
raisin
mouthfeel
is
really
thin
and
watery
drinkability
is
poor
i
hate
this
beer
d
very
good
easy
to
throw
this
back
avoid
this
sickening
beer
drinkability
quite
drinkable
and
light
not
overly
complex
but
still
has
an
agreeable
flavor
this
is
a
good
party
beer
a
typical
european
macrobrew
tasty
but
not
great
i
still
like
it
lighter
body
crispy
tones
and
relatively
easy
feel
its
just
too
bad
the
flavors
are
so
awful
otherwise
this
would
be
fairly
drinkable
i
cant
believe
i
used
to
like
this
beer
got
hooked
on
this
during
my
honeymoon
in
europe
its
better
on
tap
but
still
good
out
of
a
bottle
people
typically
cant
get
past
the
somewhat
skunky
smell
but
this
beer
is
real
drinkable
its
unlike
any
other
beer
in
the
summer
ill
post
up
by
the
pool
with
a
heineken
light
yet
another
quizzo
beer
it
pours
a
clear
pale
straw
topped
by
a
halffinger
of
white
microfoam
the
nose
comprises
funky
wheat
hard
water
and
a
light
smattering
of
flowers
the
taste
is
very
similar
with
more
water
air
yes
i
tasted
some
air
in
there
trust
me
and
mowed
grass
the
body
is
light
with
a
moderate
carbonation
and
a
watery
feel
overall
an
overtly
watery
weakling
of
a
beer
something
i
really
hope
those
wacky
europeans
dont
consider
a
fine
brew
flavor
is
strange
a
bit
off
i
believe
this
to
be
a
characteristic
of
heineken
that
i
have
tasted
before
not
skunky
just
a
weird
metallic
aftertaste
finishes
dry
and
mildly
refreshing
not
a
great
beer
but
it
is
either
this
or
amstel
light
on
special
tastes
like
funky
with
a
hint
of
aluminum
beware
it
might
be
skunked
so
im
not
sure
how
valid
this
review
is
i
may
try
it
again
on
tap
sometime
and
edit
this
review
beer
is
medium
to
light
in
body
and
has
a
grainy
bitterness
at
the
back
of
the
beer
there
isnt
much
of
an
aftertaste
or
a
forward
taste
or
a
back
taste
its
a
wet
watery
beer
its
ok
this
is
one
of
my
least
favorite
beers
id
drink
old
milwaukee
before
id
grab
this
out
of
a
cooler
i
simply
dont
like
it
after
about
5
it
taste
like
someone
has
sprayed
the
inside
of
my
mouth
with
bug
spray
it
seems
to
get
more
and
more
bitter
as
you
drink
it
flavor
is
lacking
if
you
can
call
anything
it
offers
flavor
i
rarely
rail
beers
however
a
great
ad
campaign
cant
make
up
for
a
poor
beer
at
best
hollands
best
known
beer
is
still
one
of
the
worst
dutch
beers
one
can
think
of
its
taste
is
too
chemical
and
you
have
to
keep
drinking
if
you
do
not
want
to
feel
sick
immediately
of
course
it
looks
pretty
good
maybe
even
better
than
a
lot
of
dutch
beers
like
bavaria
or
lindeboom
which
look
like
tapwater
but
still
looks
are
deceiving
when
compared
to
belgian
lagers
or
even
the
german
lagers
it
just
cant
close
the
gap
yes
its
easy
to
drink
and
yes
its
cheap
but
please
get
real
its
just
not
the
good
stuff
one
can
only
drink
this
brew
when
it
is
icecold
and
when
it
is
consumed
in
large
very
large
quantities
it
is
just
not
the
real
deal
i
would
even
prefer
a
bud
than
having
to
drink
this
im
sorry
but
for
real
heineken
crisp
and
refreshing
kind
of
coming
around
on
heineken
used
to
hate
it
overall
for
what
it
is
heineken
falls
flat
in
my
opinion
as
an
import
its
extremely
overpriced
and
too
hyped
for
its
own
good
i
will
say
that
its
crispness
does
help
to
cleanse
the
palate
while
eating
heavier
dishes
at
restaurants
and
adds
a
contrast
but
on
its
own
i
have
a
hard
time
enjoying
this
brew
to
me
this
is
the
definition
of
a
truly
average
premium
import
tastes
of
a
decent
mixture
of
hops
and
corn
as
the
smell
is
the
same
the
carbonation
seems
pretty
manageable
and
the
head
was
a
decent
two
to
three
finger
amount
all
in
all
i
could
drink
a
decent
amount
of
these
but
if
i
was
faced
with
a
choice
of
any
import
it
wouldnt
be
my
first
i
purchased
these
because
of
a
23

can
deal
and
poured
them
into
a
chilled

tight
head
of

head
disipated
in
about
a
minute
leaving
thin
lacing
with
little

or
cling
smells
like
mild
wheat
bread
with
a
overtone
of
hops
tastes
like
wheat
and
rice
with
a
slight
bitter
hint
of
hops
nothing
great
about
the
feeling
of
this
beer
in
my
mouth
slight
twang
from
the
bubbles
but
quite
thin
otherwise
this
beer
goes
down
smooth
and
gets
better
with
a
little
warmth
not
one
of
my
favorites
but
some
like
the
name
and
the
price
is
good
enough
to
bring
it
to
any
party
a
bit
of
metal
a
bit
of
bland
yeastiness
and
no
alcoholic
taste
i
guess
thats
ok
and
you
dont

a
highly
agitated
pale
yellow
pour
leads
to
a
twoinch
thick
puffy
soapy
white
head
that
lingers
more
or
less
the
green
bottle
causes
the
inevitable
skunkiness
but
still
there
are
bits
of
grain
grass
and
light
hops
in
there
the
taste
leads
with
a
good
dose
of
barley
malts
and
a
slightly
hopped
by
sour
ending
heineken
the
one
served
at
parties
as
the
alternative
to
budmillercoors
but
their
tv
ads
are
good
that
being
said
its
not
the
worst
option
available
at
the
store
or
bar
its
definitely
better
than
the
usual
suspects
ultimately
it
has
a
bitter
taste
where
you
can
really
taste
the
alcohol
all
in
all
a
soso
beer
but
a
notch
above
some
of
the
blander
us
fare
there
are
a
few
things
i
find
offensive
namely
the
persistent
underlying
sulfur
and
the
gritty
teeth
finish
but
overall
it
does
quite
well
against
other
macros
to
sum
it
up
i
could
drink
it
all
night
given
its
abv
and
the
fact
that
it
doesnt
fill
you
up
too
much
but
id
rather
go
for
something
a
little
less
proccessed
and
a
little
more
tastefull
indubitably
i
will
nothing
too
spectacular
nor
offensive
d
i
would
probably
have
this
as
a
last
resort
i
bought
it
for
the
sake
of
economy
and
to
revisit
somethign
i
have
drank
for
probably
at
least
5
yrs
not
something
i
would
recommend
drinkability
when
out
for
dinner
and
the
selection
is
limited
heineken
is
a
good
choice
but
i
wouldnt
buy
any
for
the
home
i
switched
to
wine
pretty
light
for
a
lager
i
think
it
is
a
little
too
heavily
carbonated
and
seems
a
little
like
an
alcoholic
sprite
the
carbonation
definitely
overrides
any
truly
distinctive
flavor
in
the
beer
despite
this
i
do
think
heineken
is
more
refreshing
than
most
beers
and
i
never
turn
one
down
overall
this
was
the
first
beer
i
ever
tried
i
hated
it
then
but
now
i
could
drink
this
with
ease
however
i
rarely
ever
purchase
this
beer
this
is
just
a
middle
of
the
road
beer
you
could
do
much
worse
but
also
much
better
heineken
is
a
great
goto
beer
when
youre
in
the
mood
for
something
above
the
american
macrobrew
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
could
probably
drink
it
as
my
regular
beer
with
occasional
rotation
to
something
with
a
little
more
kick
not
the
best
beer
on
earth
but
absolutely
worth
trying
if
you
havent
and
worth
retrying
if
you
have
rjt
large
head
with
an
agressive
pour
pale
gold
with
sharp
clarity
smell
has
the
familiar
musty
grassy
aroma
that
the
european
lagers
are
known
for
but
is
very
light
taste
is
clean
and
fresh
a
little
honey
flavor
from
the
malts
and
a
little
bit
of
grass
from
the
hops
again
very
light
on
flavor
very
easy
drinker
hence
the
popularity
not
anything
special
but
ive
had
worse
d
hey
if
you
want
to
show
your
friends
that
you
can
spend
money
buy
them
heineken
i
would
treat
my
friends
better
and
get
some
bitburger
pauli
girl
or
yuengling
if
i
didnt
want
to
give
them
swill
not
bad
but
not
great
either
md
light
bodied
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
in
the
mouth
surprising
considering
the
almost
non
existant
head
drinkability
is
good
if
kept
in
the
bottle
and
served
at
suggested
temperature
a
european
lager
very
basic
and
a
bit
simplistic
mouth
small
but
also
affected
by
low
acidity
and
a
touch
of
course
like
the
green
fruit
that
is
found
in
both
the
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
she
recalls
as
a
little
european
standards
such
as
carlsberg
easy
to
drink
but
no
real
flavor
d
not
bad
interesting
flavors
that
make
me
want
to
try
it
again
and
again
but
not
something
id
want
a
lot
of
too
much
cheap
hops
for
me
pours
a
clear
golden
color
head
dissipated
quickly
smells
a
little
funny
but
i
did
get
that
grainy
smell
tastes
like
nothing
spectacular
a
little
bitter
a
little
grainy
and
you
can
taste
the
alcohol
in
there
it
feels
thin
and
carbonated
overall
this
is
not
the
beer
for
me
heineken
is
the
sophisticated
beer
of
my
grandfathers
generation
to
me
it
is
just
another
bland
import
lager
d
it
is
a
refreshing
feeling
beer
if
not
for
the
persistent
skunkiness
i
could
see
this
being
enjoyable
in
large
quantities
o
while
the
beer
is
cold
drink
it
quickly
dont
let
it
be
just
a
couple
degrees
warmer
d
meh
better
than
bmc
but
not
by
much
its
drinkable
as
are
most
mild
euro
lagers
there
is
a
time
and
place
for
heineken
and
its
widely
available
im
thinking
summer
into
fall
when
fishing
perhaps
it
does
taste
a
bit
better
from
the
5liter
minikegs
that
are
now
widely
available
this
is
one
of
those
beers
appropriate
if
youre
looking
wake
up
in
the
morning
around
the
toilet
it
doesnt
have
a
terrible
taste
but
the
smell
is
horrendous
also
i
dont
recommend
it
for
any
significant
food
pairing
because
of
the
potent
aftertaste
tried
this
again
in
a
mini
keg
and
it
was
very
decent
it
would
rate
this
beer
3
5
the
taste
is
so
cripser
and
cleaner
i
dont
know
what
it
is
about
the
bottle
that
makes
it
skunkier
but
tap
makes
better
keg
has
no
skunky
taste
or
smell
and
mouthful
is
refreshing
ive
had
this
numerous
times
and
ill
probably
drink
it
again
i
would
encourage
others
not
to
believe
the
marketing
step
away
from
it
and
try
something
better
this
was
a
beer
i
use
to
think
was
very
good
while
heineken
probably
isnt
good
enough
to
warrant
its
expensive
price
or
ubiquitous
worldwide
reputation
there
are
other
factors
that
distinguish
it
from
many
mainstream
industriallyproduced
lagers
namely
that
its
palatable
and
still
recognizable
as
a
traditional
europeanstyle
lager
beyond
that
however
there
really
isnt
much
else
to
say
cheers
not
sure
i
like
this
beer
its
very
well
advertised
but
i
think
it
should
be
placed
a
little
above
the
big
three
light
beers
absolutely
not
worth
the
price
blah
what
is
next
drinkability
its
crisp
and
goes
down
easy
but
its
price
is
prohibitive
better
beers
could
be
obtained
for
the
same
cost
mouthfeel
was
very
thin
but
was
carbonated
quite
well
overall
this
beer
was
minimally
different
from
other
standard
american
style
lagers
quite
bland
but
i
guess
it
would
be
ok
as
a
lawnmower
beer
d
its
not
that
good
the
overwhelming
bad
flavor
ad
aroma
combine
to
make
a
bad
beer
pass
on
this
in
the
aisle
d
its
popular
and
drinkable
not
necessarily
my
thing
but
it
remains
something
of
an
icon
in
terms
of
imported
beer
gets
weaker
and
thinner
down
bottle
there
is
no
real
taste
other
than
the
skunkishness
which
is
actually
agreeable
in
a
strange
way
to
a
hophead
i
guess
this
is
a
nice
example
of
a
pale
lager
probably
one
of
the
better
ones
of
that
style
a
good
one
to
go
to
if
the
craft
ales
are
not
to
be
had
and
a
nice
one
for
warm
weather
d
if
your
looking
for
flavor
this
isnt
it
if
your
just
looking
for
something
to
quinch
your
thirst
here
you
go
d
mass
produced
lager
with
a
weak
flavour
profile
not
much
else
to
say
really
pass
there
are
few
bigger
triumphs
in
marketing
than
heinekens
campaigns
coronas
is
one
of
those
few
taste
has
decent
hop
over
mild
malt
sweet
has
a
czech
pils
minerally
bitter
bite
and
tinlike
hop
flavor
also
oranges
and
graham
cracker
some
nice
dextrinous
mouthfeel
that
washed
clean
due
to
the
prickly
cleansing
finish
light
and
drinkable
no
skunky
flavor
like
many
people
claim
purchased
from
superior
liquor
in
colorado
drinkability
probably
deserves
a
lower
score
but
i
drink
it
time
to
time
and
is
available
in
a
lot
of
bars
served
from
bottle
into
an
imperial
pint
poured
a
pale
yellow
with
minimal
white
head
there
was
no
apparent
lacing
present
the
aroma
consisted
of
a
musty
and
sour
note
the
flavor
was
of
wheat
sour
and
nutty
hints
it
was
light
on
the
palate
with
low
carbonation
overall
this
brew
is
very
bland
definitely
needs
more
flavorings
to
be
competitive
with
others
in
its
style
aroma
would
help
as
well
as
it
is
not
appealing
not
horrible
if
you
are
in
a
pinch
but
if
you
have
a
choice
of
something
else
choose
it
had
one
of
these
at
a
memorial
day
party
in
honor
of
the
late
great
dennis
hopper
heineken
fuck
that
shit
pabst
blue
ribbon
rest
in
peace
brother
not
much
else
to
say
here
a
watery
looking
light
golden
color
a
finger
or
so
of
bright
white
foam
a
skunky
aroma
and
a
taste
to
match
a
disappointment
all
around
i
should
have
went
home
and
watched
blue
velvet
instead
one
of
the
better
on
a
budget
beers
that
ill
go
to
if
i
am
low
on
funds
its
85
degrees
today
this
beer
is
cold
and
as
refreshing
as
can
be
ive
never
had
a
heineken
this
fresh
out
of
a
bottle
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
though
lacking
somewhat
in
the
flavour
department
but
still
very
crisp
and
nice
the
local
version
of
this
beer
is
much
poorer
poured
into
mug
and
seems
kind
of
light
for
a
lager
it
smells
like
marijuana
has
a
decent
taste
but
is
not
very
drinkable
as
it
starts
to
have
a
funky
taste
after
one
or
two
bottles
not
sure
why
this
is
the
goto
beer
for
some
of
my
buddies
it
has
been
years
since
i
last
had
one
of
these
and
honestly
it
is
better
than
the
last
time
since
this
bottle
isnt
skunked
theres
no
hint
of
grains
and
grasses
just
pure
adjunct
flavors
and
a
hint
of
hops
pours
a
bright
clear
light
gold
with
a
small
white
head
smell
is
some
herbal
hops
and
light
sweet
malt
pretty
flavorful
herbal
hops
good
light
malt
backbone
finishes
a
bit
dry
and
medium
bodied
well
carbonated
very
drinkable
this
is
one
where
the
serving
type
really
matters
the
green
bottles
skunk
this
beer
way
better
on
tap
or
in
cans
okfound
this
next
to
a
dumpster
at
work
a
vigorous
pour
into
a
pilsner
glass
reveals
a
pale
clear
yellow
liquid
with
a
quickly
dissapating
head
fairly
heavy
carbonation
with
not
very
much
lacing
smell
is
skunkedpart
rice
and
corn
with
no
apparent
hop
aromas
present
taste
is
pretty
close
to
the
smell
not
much
going
on
but
heyit
was
free
and
ill
take
it
over
bud
light
anyday
good
for
the
style
if
your
into
euro
pale
lagers
ill
give
this
one
a
mediocre
review
because
its
good
for
what
it
is
overall
this
is
way
better
in
a
can
however
i
will
say
as
i
said
in
my
can
review
that
i
will
take
this
over
a
bud
any
day
overall
this
beer
really
is
not
worth
the
money
and
i
dont
really
enjoy
drinking
it
because
of
the
mineral
aftertaste
i
could
care
less
if
it
is
from
holland
because
its
just
not
that
good
pretty
crisp
solid
swill
for
someone
that
is
seeking
a
euro
alternative
to
the
typical
party
beers
if
you
try
comparing
this
to
the
finest
from
the
local
craft
breweries
of
course
youll
be
disappointed
if
youre
a
more
typical
mainstream
beer
drinking
kind
of
person
and
dont
drink
your
beer
from
a
glass
its
worth
a
shot
d
east
to
relax
and
drink
with
not
a
beer
you
can
down
a
whole
bunch
of
d
it
makes
me
pretty
happy
that
this
is
one
of
the
best
selling
beers
in
the
world
if
the
majority
drinks
this
then
there
will
be
lots
of
qualitybeer
left
for
me
and
most
of
you
guys
the
body
like
most
pale
lagers
is
extremely
thin
and
wet
this
is
made
to
be
drunk
quickly
spot
on
for
the
style
but
i
dont
care
for
it
very
light
weak
flavors
make
this
one
up
some
buttered
corn
and
a
bit
of
a
lemony
twang
on
the
finish
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
because
its
light
wet
and
quasirefreshing
but
im
gonna
pass
not
very
drinkable
i
would
call
this
beer
bad
but
ive
had
worse
as
far
as
macros
go
instead
of
the
bready
corn
taste
in
an
average
american
macro
its
kind
of
a
stale
fruit
taste
definitely
some
euroness
even
some
booze
detectable
lol
mouthfeel
is
actually
decent
seems
wellbodied
and
carbonation
is
not
bad
i
am
not
a
fan
of
the
taste
but
it
is
pretty
easy
to
drink
even
after
this
small
bottle
i
was
all
set
by
the
finish
its
probably
better
than
most
beers
this
is
probably
one
of
the
better
ones

5this
beer
is
one
of
the
staple
beers
my
peer
group
enjoys
for
many
reasons
in
the
american
beer
drinking
culture
it
is
exactly
what
people
are
looking
for
a
easydrinking
lager
with
a
light
body
and
a
light
hop
presence
for
the
american
light
lager
fan
it
is
great
however
but
not
too
bad
there
are
also
touches
of
grass
and
sweetness
this
sounds
odd
but
i
would
drink
it
if
i
had
limited
options

but
still
a
touch
of
sweet

and
it
goes

the

a

which
is

for

does
not
suppose
to

it
has
a

to
it

of
a

taste
that
you

although
there
are

better
lager
options
in

where
this
is
the
only
import
option
i
would
not
be
opposed
notes
my
father
loves
this
beerbut
i
have
to
write
it
like
it
is
the
beer
is
mediocre
and
i
can
understand
that
one
could
get
used
to
this
beer
yet
this
is
just
not
for
me
still
not
the
worst
beer
ever
and
tolerable
to
drink
overall
3
4
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
im
growing
less
and
less
fond
of
euro
pale
lagers
but
id
like
to
find
one
thats
really
good
a
refreshing
beer
and
better
than
some
other
epls
out
there
but
still
just
unimpressive
and
uninteresting
d
overall
its
not
a
terrible
beer
but
that
late
palatefinish
weirdfuck
taste
is
really
bothering
me
if
you
havent
tried
a
heineken
mini
keg
or
on
tap
heineken
you
havent
tried
heineken
i
agree
that
the
flavor
is
a
little
weak
but
the
skunk
smell
fades
as
the
beer
warms
like
a
couple
other
beers
i
have
tried
used
to
drink
this
in
high
school
but
not
so
much
anymore
i
only
drank
this
one
for
the
purpose
of
review
mouthfeel
is
decent
not
too
watery
not
too
thick
goes
down
smooth
and
could
definitly
continue
on
these
babies
if
you
like
flavorless
brews
if
this
was
super
cheap
i
might
even
buy
one
again
well
too
bad
pours
the
same
light
straw
color
poor
carbonation
as
well
head
fizzles
out
quickly
smells
of
mild
spicy
noble
hops
with
a
noticable
amount
of
skunk
skunk
mellows
as
head
settles
cat
urine
becomes
more
prominent
light
crisp
mouth
feel
some
hops
tingle
the
tongue
the
minimal
malt
sweetness
that
was
noticable
from
the
can
is
more
of
a
toasted
graininess
perhaps
since
the
hops
are
out
of
whack
the
malts
become
more
prominent
this
beer
may
benefit
from
swigging
straight
out
of
the
bottle
gasp
just
casually
offhand
analyzing
other
reviewers
experiences
with
this
beer
it
seems
drafts
and
cans
are
consistently
betterreviewed
than
bottles
it
leaves
me
thinking
it
isnt
heinekens
brewing
process
that
is
at
issue
with
the
oftmentioned
funky
skunkiness
but
their
poor
choice
of
greenbottled
packaging
heineken
does
a
nice
marketing
job
but
needs
to
tweak
their
brewing
methods
a
bit
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
yellow
color
and
has
a
fizzy
white
head
the
nose
is
of
bitter
grassy
hops
and
stale
malt
the
flavor
is
bitter
and
unenjoyable
extra
light
yet
heavily
carbonated
body
drinkability
as
a
mass
produced
lager
goes
this
is
ok
like
i
said
if
forced
or
choosing
to
drink
do
it
extra
cold
had
it
right
from
the
bottle
a
very
drinkable
macro
with
a
lot
more
flavor
than
many
other
american
macros
like
others
however
its
best
very
cold
on
a
side
note
i
was
amused
when
i
ordered
a
hiney
and
the
bartender
had
no
clue
what
i
was
talking
about
made
me
sorta
chuckle
d
just
about
anything
is
drinkable
for
me
i
could
drink
it
at
a
wedding
maybe
a
barbque
but
i
wouldnt
purchase
a
six
pack
just
to
have
on
a
friday
night
drinkability
heineken
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
its
light
and
tasty
its
at
least
more
interesting
than
most
american
lagers
i
tasted
this
alongside
a
bottle
of
miller
genuine
draft
and
the
heino
wins
but
pretty
average
euro
lager
fare
drinkability
i
wouldnt
drink
this
again
if
i
had
the
choice
but
i
am
glad
that
i
was
able
to
at
least
try
it
as
far
as
i
can
tell
this
tends
to
get
lumped
in
with
the
whole
budweisermillercoors
party
beer
conglomerate
so
out
of
those
id
have
to
say
that
this
is
probably
the
best
of
its
competition
more
enjoyable
in
the
bottle
so
leave
it
in
there
d
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
session
brews
mainly
because
its
widely
available
and
much
better
imo
then
the
macros
usually
offered
alongside
it
id
say
its
also
a
good
gateway
beyond
macros
if
thats
all
youve
ever
drank
which
is
true
for
a
lot
of
people
non
bas
of
course
d
heineken
is
that
beer
that
is
one
step
above
the
bmcs
but
not
really
a
micro
or
craft
brew
at
all
i
think
it
gets
a
lot
of
flack
but
on
the
whole
if
the
beer
isnt
skuned
from
the
green
bottles
it
is
not
that
bad
especially
for
the
style
it
is
one
of
those
beers
that
if
you
are
out
and
the
place
doenst
have
any
micros
then
id
go
for
a
heinken
especially
with
seafood
or
other
lighter
fare
actually
reminds
me
a
bit
of
a
lighter
flavor
pilsner
urqell
d
ok
but
nothing
special
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
if
it
were
offered
to
me
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
and
buy
it
i
dont
know
why
this
beer
is
popular
marketing
i
guess
as
it
offers
very
little
it
has
a
displeasing
aroma
no
body
and
odd
flavor
its
light
enough
and
not
so
offensive
that
it
wouldnt
be
any
trouble
to
drink
a
few
of
these
in
a
sitting
however
had
heiny
again
while
doing
taxes
with
my
accountant
4808
and
it
was
much
better
crisp
somewhat
clovey
bitter
taste
with
no
strange
smell
i
think
that
what
i
got
at
the
trade
show
above
had
gone
skunky
i
upgraded
my
smell
and
drinkability
ratings
somewhat
as
a
result
taste
is
bitter
and
mouthfell
is
carbonated
to
me
i
have
always
thought
that
the
taste
and
smell
of
this
beer
is
what
sets
it
apart
from
the
bmc
crew
during
my
teen
years
the
green
bottle
beers
from
europe
and
canada
were
definitely
a
step
up
but
i
dont
think
these
beers
measure
up
to
most
of
the
craft
brews
being
produced
domestically
if
i
am
out
at
a
bar
and
buying
a
beer
i
am
probably
buying
a
yuengling
if
i
am
picking
up
a
case
for
2530
at
my
distributor
i
am
buying
victory
or
sam
adams
not
heineken
drinkability
is
moderate
low
alcohol
and
lack
of
flavor
makes
for
easy
consumption
however
overall
blandness
does
not
encourage
you
to
do
so
d
you
could
have
another
or
you
could
go
with
any
of
a
thousand
other
and
better
beers
two
thumbs
down
straw
color
thin
fizzy
head
par
for
the
course
in
as
a
standard
macro
lager
sugery
sweet
smell
of
bananna
nut
bread
taste
is
of
that
along
with
an
grassy
acrid
overtone
and
an
omnipresent
cloying
sweetness
which
becomes
too
much
before
too
long
what
the
hell
i
was
not
expecting
this
at
all
i
guess
others
testimonials
on
this
brew
are
a
load
of
garbage
i
was
not
impressed
and
most
likely
wont
bother
with
it
again
theres
better
and
cheaper
beer
out
there
this
beer
has
a
light
and
refreshing
feel
to
it
a
decent
summer
lager
i
suppose
the
taste
is
a
little
less
complex
than
i
would
like
for
as
much
as
it
costs
would
make
a
decent
session
beverage
but
again
its
a
bit
more
than
i
prefer
to
pay
still
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
for
lagers
you
can
do
better
and
cheaper
just
getting
a
domestic
brew
aftertaste
is
back
to
sulfer
and
sweetness
so
i
guess
the
real
answer
is
that
it
bores
me
not
bad
not
stinky
not
skunky
just
boring
heineken
pours
a
light
straw
color
with
a
one
finger
white
head
the
head
fades
quickly
and
there
is
no
lacing
down
the
glass
true
to
a
lager
though
it
is
crystal
clear
the
smell
is
very
earthy
and
i
detect
subtle
hints
of
corn
the
taste
is
clean
but
has
a
disturbing
adjunct
taste
i
would
expect
in
much
lower
priced
beers
the
lager
yeast
presence
is
noticeable
which
is
a
plus
and
the
aftertaste
is
mild
like
a
lager
the
mouthfeel
is
average
it
is
not
watery
thin
but
lacks
good
body
just
average
heineken
is
very
drinkable
at
5
abv
and
goes
down
smooth
with
no
poor
aftertaste
overall
if
youre
out
at
a
swill
bar
and
this
is
the
top
of
their
line
you
will
still
have
a
decent
night
of
beer
if
youre
out
to
session
drink
the
next
day
may
be
a
different
story
the
skunky
and
sour
tastes
may
ruin
it
a
bit
but
its
actually
a
pretty
crisp
beer
descent
enough
lawnmower
beer
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
watery
its
refreshing
for
what
its
worth
not
as
bad
as
i
was
expecting
d
fairly
easy
to
drink
its
below
average
for
an
import
id
rather
buy
a
cheaper
domestic
drinkability
okay
in
a
pinch
poured
a
22
oz
bomber
bottle
into
a
flute
glass
because
my
pils
was
chipped
poured
and
left
a
decent
size
head
that
quickly
faded
w
no
lacings
on
top
of
a
yellowish
seethru
body
smell
is
hoppy
and
grainy
the
taste
is
hoppy
and
not
much
else
but
it
isnt
well
balanced
and
leaves
a
drying
feeling
in
the
mouth
and
theres
not
reason
to
keep
drinking
this
the
beers
popularity
is
more
because
of
advertising
than
a
high
quality
product
duh
not
my
first
pick
but
sometimes
its
this
or
bmc
and
i
will
take
this
over
bud
anyday
pale
yellow
in
color
with
a
white
head
that
quickly
disapeared
smell
a
little
hops
not
much
else
taste
a
little
hop
bitterness
and
a
hint
of
unplesent
sulfer
not
much
of
an
aftertaste
drinkability
a
good
choice
if
your
in
a
bar
that
might
not
offer
much
else
d
i
never
liked
this
one
from
the
bottle
i
recently
retried
this
beer
from
the
can
and
am
moving
it
up
from
my
original
c
assessment
if
i
am
going
to
buy
a
lager
i
usually
pick
this
or
budweiser
it
just
depends
on
my
budget
this
is
another
one
of
those
beers
popular
popular
among
the
yuppie
crowd
its
famous
only
for
being
a
brand
name
not
much
else
its
essentially
a
below
average
imported
beer
only
reviewing
the
nitro
can
the
rest
is
just
crap
the
nitro
can
is
probably
the
best
way
to
drink
heineken
zero
skunky
flavor
color
is
golden
straw
hed
is
big
but
disapates
little
lacing
flavor
is
sweeter
than
the
cans
bottles
and
kegs
ok
finish
i
never
buy
this
beer
in
any
form
but
when
you
are
at
a
party
and
it
is
this
or
bud
light
i
will
choke
it
down
tried
to
make
this
one
fun
draughtkeg
i
e
heinekeg
for
power
hour
no
smell
out
of
the
keg
small
frothy
white
head
actually
pretty
fair
lacing
all
things
considered
clear
light
yellow
color
taste
is
corn
and
faint
skunk
well
it
goes
down
well
if
taken
one
shot
at
a
time
for
powerhour
light
watery
fizzy
and
metallic
are
the
four
things
you
need
to
know
notice
the
serving
temperature
and
enjoy
d
drinkable
but
many
other
readily
available
macro
lagers
beat
it
by
a
long
shot
nothing
horrible
going
on
here
but
that
said
nothing
good
or
exciting
not
going
to
finish
this
one
below
average
and
boring
overall
a
good
macroish
beer
tends
to
be
on
the
sweet
side
but
there
is
enough
acid
and
bitterness
at
the
end
to
offer
some
balance
not
much
malts
going
on
and
hops
are
bare
however
the
fruit
forward
tone
of
this
beer
makes
a
nice
refreshing
summer
beer
solid
everyday
beer
but
not
great
all
the
intangibles
are
there
for
this
style
but
the
flavor
and
aroma
are
crap
this
may
be
the
worst
beer
i
have
ever
had
drinkability
i
never
liked
dark
beers
and
my
taste
buds
changed
to
like
dark
beers
so
i
thought
its
been
a
long
time
since
i
had
a
heiny
same
old
stuff
didnt
like
it
then
same
now
im
sticking
with
sam
adams
when
i
go
out
to
eat
i
was
on
the
roller
coaster
ride
to
try
other
beers
poured
a
white
head
thin
and
it
did
not
last
long
at
all
smelled
a
noticeable
sweetness
of
honey
especially
as
the
beer
warmed
and
neared
the
end
but
also
a
bit
of
skunkiness
a
quick
nice
bitter
bite
to
the
aftertaste
overall
this
wasnt
as
watery
tasting
as
some
pale
lagers
and
had
a
decent
enough
flavor
hey
baby
get
your
hands
off
my
heiniaustin
powers
poured
a
clear
pale
yellow
retention
is
that
of
a
macro
lager
and
minimal
lacing
down
the
glass
aroma
includes
sulphur
light
grain
and
the
trademark
skunky
hop
the
flavor
leans
towards
the
hops
which
is
fine
not
much
malt
flavor
mostly
adjunctlight
grain
and
huskiness
the
hops
are
still
sulphurskunky
finish
is
thin
body
is
light
medium
to
light
and
dry
it
always
bothers
me
when
i
ask
people
what
their
favourite
beer
is
and
they
say
heineken
either
they
have
they
too
have
fallen
victim
to
heinekens
massive
marketing
budget
or
they
really
havent
embraced
the
opportunity
to
open
their
horizons
to
real
quality
beers
from
around
the
world
their
loss
i
guess
appearance
is
a
very
light
golden
with
a
crisp
head
that
dissapates
quickly
smell
slight
skunk
corny
and
light
grass
taste
is
a
light
bitter
sweet
that
cloys
in
your
mouth
mouthfeel
is
light
and
crisp
although
i
personally
wouldnt
consider
it
a
session
one
1
pint
8fl
oz
bottle
is
good
enough
for
me
not
really
all
that
drinkable
due
to
the
sweetness
out
of
the
epls
i
found
stella
much
better
than
this
daside
from
the
mouthfeel
being
so
poor
i
could
see
being
able
to
pound
these
down
heineken
lager
is
the
british
empire
of
the
pilsner
style
the
sun
never
sets
on
a
heineken
you
can
get
it
virtually
in
any
bar
save
a
few
holdouts
nice
and
crisp
and
refreshing
it
goes
well
with
most
regular
foods
and
does
a
good
job
washing
it
down
employs
a
nice
yeast
that
was
originally
developed
by
pasteur
for
heineken
a
solid
c
student
but
not
a
lot
of
character
hate
it
or
love
it
heineken
represents
its
style
consistently
this
beer
is
my
guilty
pleasure
many
people
assume
that
all
heineken
is
skunked
sometimes
it
actually
is
but
most
of
the
time
that
strong
malty
smell
and
taste
is
how
its
supposed
to
be
i
love
hops
as
much
as
the
next
guy
but
it
isnt
the
star
of
the
show
here
its
a
decent
example
of
a
euro
pale
lager
but
it
really
has
some
character
of
its
own
its
the
perfect
companion
to
deepdish
pizza
or
some
zaxbys
style
fried
chicken
for
bmc
its
something
that
can
go
down
easy
when
you
are
smashed
while
thats
not
necessarily
a
good
thing
it
makes
a
difference
when
its
a
choice
between
this
and
bud
light
so
thin
fizzy
body
its
probably
been
10
years
since
ive
had
one
of
these
and
will
hopefully
be
10
more
if
you
enjoy
the
scent
of
a
skunk
during
spring
rut
and
a
taste
to
match
then
this
is
the
lager
for
you
otherwise
youd
best
serve
yourself
by
paying
far
less
and
drinking
some
generic
beer
this
is
the
only
dutch
beer
that
is
very
populair
in
other
countrys
and
as
a
dutchman
i
have
no
idea
why
as
far
as
i
know
all
the
younger
people
in
the
eastern
part
of
the
netherlands
think
it
tastes
like
horsepee
but
no
one
really
knows
what
that
tastes
like
it
is
exceptionally
easy
to
drink
because
it
drinks
like
water
d
better
than
most
domestic
lagers
heineken
has
some
subtle
flavors
and
is
very
easytodrink
i
would
pass
on
this
for
just
about
any
other
style
of
craft
beer
but
my
options
are
severely
limited
while
flying
southwest
despite
being
a
popular
cultural
icon
i
was
never
a
particular
fan
of
this
brew
always
thought
it
was
rather
bitter
with
an
uninviting
aftertaste
which
just
didnt
do
it
for
me
appearance
and
smell
failed
to
impress
and
the
taste
was
just
above
awful
not
for
me
the
mouthfeel
was
equally
poor
and
the
brew
isnt
too
drinkable
i
know
many
people
who
just
love
this
beer
but
i
still
cant
see
why
not
a
horrible
sample
but
would
never
cop
this
by
myself
not
recommended
in
my
opinion
not
too
bad
i
had
heard
heineken
in
the
can
was
vastly
different
from
the
green
bottles
and
those
people
were
right
i
dont
like
the
bottled
version
but
i
would
definitely
drink
this
at
a
ball
game
or
while
mowing
the
lawn
drinkability
mild
taste
therefore
can
drink
loads
of
them
if
you
absolutely
had
to
anyway
d
very
low
drink
ability
tastes
terrible
how
is
this
crap
trendy
id
rather
drink
a
bmc
over
this
stuff
pours
a
pale
golden
straw
color
with
a
minimum
of
bubbly
white
head
that
disappears
almost
immediately
as
for
smell
i
caught
the
aroma
of
skunkiness
as
soon
as
i
opened
the
bottle
and
it
got
stronger
as
i
was
pouring
now
that
its
in
the
glass
all
i
can
really
smell
is
faint
skunkiness
other
than
that
theres
nothing
the
taste
is
clean
slightly
hoppy
but
no
real
bitterness
and
i
cant
really
make
out
the
hop
flavor
it
has
a
very
plasticy
taste
to
it
as
well
mouthfeel
is
very
watery
overall
its
sorta
drinkable
in
the
same
way
mcdonalds
is
edible
its
very
similar
to
beer
only
with
less
of
what
makes
beer
good
overall
very
average
i
would
probably
buy
it
again
after
some
time
just
to
remind
myself
about
it
but
for
the
price
there
are
lots
more
interesting
things
out
there
with
the
smoothness
one
could
drink
this
all
day
if
they
liked
the
taste
i
can
only
drink
this
beer
when
i
am
on
vacation
and
dont
have
to
wake
up
early
for
work
the
next
morning
heavy
heavy
lager
taste
and
a
true
and
i
mean
true
hop
inclusion
i
am
wondering
if
heineken
is
really
brewed
in
holland
and
then
shipped
to
us
i
heard
the
it
was
also
brewed
in
canada
and
the
lable
is
misleading
yes
it
is
brewed
in
holland
but
the
united
states
gets
it
from
canada
is
this
true
bold
really
good
lager
certainly
two
steps
above
american
macro
counterparts
such
as
budweiser
pours
a
nice
thick
white
head
atop
a
light
golden
body
with
decent
lacing
on
the
way
down
the
glass
the
smell
and
taste
bring
a
prominent
wheat
and
corn
flavor
with
bold
hoppiness
though
the
finish
was
slightly
bitter
it
didnt
detract
well
worth
the
try
and
just
as
fine
on
tap
you
see
heinekens
everywhere
the
usual
green
short
bottle
i
hate
to
make
comparisons
but
heineken
reminds
me
a
lot
of
stella
same
european
lager
with
that
same
wheatcorn
husky
taste
really
dry
and
crisp
taste
but
goes
down
real
easy
overall
probably
a
step
up
above
american
lagers
in
quality
but
not
on
the
level
of
microbrews
from
anywhere
in
my
opinion
drinkability
heineken
a
beer
that
will
punish
you
bad
flavors
if
you
dont
drink
it
fast
and
absolutely
ice
cold
forget
the
skunky
bottles
instead
stick
to
the
cans
draft
or
minikegs
delivered
by
robochicks
smell
weak
and
grainy
taste
watery
and
plain
im
searching
for
descriptors
here
but
there
just
wasnt
that
much
to
it
mouthfeel
was
okay
but
given
the
weak
taste
it
wasnt
really
supporting
anything
i
didnt
enjoy
this
and
wont
be
back
to
it
if
i
can
avoid
it
d
i
felt
a
little
bit
sick
after
a
holiday
5
pack
and
couldnt
go
on
i
made
it
past
a
few
though
not
a
bad
beer
not
a
great
beer
this
is
a
vary
middleoftheroad
beer
it
is
better
than
the
bmcs
since
there
actually
is
some
hoppy
taste
back
in
my
youth
when
i
drank
mostly
massproduced
american
swill
i
thought
heineken
was
pretty
spectacular
now
i
rate
it
as
a
drinkable
average
beer
poured
a
mid
golden
colour
with
a
fluffy
head
of
about
half
an
inch
which
quickly
disappeared
smells
faintly
of
yeast
and
hops
a
rather
mild
taste
with
minimal
bitterness
and
not
too
high
on
the
fizz
not
overly
flavourful
though
is
drinkable
but
not
something
id
actively
seek
out
perfectly
drinkable
in
a
can
or
on
draft
avoid
those
dreaded
green
bottles
when
you
can
d
not
the
worst
ive
had
i
guess
its
sessionable
there
are
countless
others
id
go
to
before
this
d
a
decent
lager
with
an
odd
aroma
that
will
keep
me
from
having
it
again
drinkability
a
great
light
bodied
beer
i
feel
the
canned
version
is
consistently
superior
to
the
bottled
version
ive
had
this
beer
plenty
of
times
in
the
green
bottle
and
many
times
the
beer
has
been
light
polluted
and
skunky
so
this
time
i
tried
it
in
that
can
that
looks
like
a
handheld
keg
i
think
it
may
have
helped
the
typical
skunkyness
is
not
present
unfortunately
neither
is
the
hype
about
the
taste
that
the
commercials
have
us
believing
this
beer
is
marketed
as
a
premium
import
but
its
nothing
fancy
simple
light
gold
seethrough
beer
with
plain
white
disappearing
head
smells
ok
light
hop
and
malted
barley
scent
nothing
special
and
nothing
jumps
out
at
you
tastes
just
how
it
smells
slightly
better
than
your
usual
macrobrew
light
and
watery
in
the
mouth
but
i
sure
could
drink
a
gob
of
these
if
i
had
to
heineken
pours
a
clear
light
golden
color
with
a
decent
head
that
lasts
for
a
minute
or
two
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
grainy
with
hints
of
malt
and
not
much
else
the
flavor
is
crisp
with
more
of
the
grainy
flavor
and
a
hint
of
sulfur
there
is
less
malt
sweetness
than
in
the
aroma
no
real
hop
flavor
to
speak
of
but
there
is
a
slight
bitterness
my
only
real
problem
with
this
beer
is
that
it
is
priced
at
the
same
level
as
craft
beer
but
has
the
flavor
of
a
decent
macro
why
waste
the
energy
getting
it
across
the
ocean
when
you
can
get
a
similar
tasting
beer
locally
heineken
used
to
taste
different
20
years
ago
than
it
does
today
i
think
they
changed
the
beer
out
of
a
magnum
can
its
ok
a
drinkable
macro
but
not
as
good
as
becks
in
the
same
price
point
heineken
is
just
lacking
character
and
the
hop
taste
i
remember
is
no
longer
there
this
beer
is
no
good
skunked
it
poured
a
light
piss
colored
yellow
that
smelled
alot
like
well
a
skunk
the
taste
was
not
much
better
as
it
was
pretty
skunked
this
is
not
the
first
heineken
ive
had
just
the
latest
they
all
have
tasted
the
same
skunked
dont
drink
this
beer
or
let
people
fool
you
into
thinking
this
is
a
good
beer
in
all
my
years
i
have
never
had
a
fresh
tasting
heineken
all
have
been
skunked
maybe
its
better
in
holland
but
until
i
get
to
holland
this
is
all
i
can
get
my
hands
on
anyways
ive
had
quite
a
few
of
these
in
my
day
ranging
from
a
decent
average
beer
to
a
beer
so
skunked
i
have
to
quickly
choke
it
down
so
i
can
get
on
to
the
next
one
its
always
a
simple
yellowgolden
color
a
tad
on
the
fizzy
side
with
very
little
head
retention
easy
to
drink
when
tried
ontap
but
still
not
that
great
of
a
beer
this
one
is
more
of
a
marketing
success
than
a
brewing
success
id
suggest
trying
it
ontap
but
where
im
from
if
a
place
actually
has
heineken
ontap
they
probably
also
have
something
better
available
this
one
came
in
a
500
ml
tall
canand
i
must
say
i
enjoyed
this
one
a
lot
more
than
the
one
in
the
green
bottle
straw
yellow
clear
color
with
a
bubbly
white
head
and
little
retention
and
mild

to
drinknot
a
bad
beerquite
refreshing
too
i
know
this
review
is
going
to
seem
atypical
from
the
majoritybottles
but
i
felt
compelled
after
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
the
actual
quality
of
the
beer
when
it
isnt
full
of
impurities
i
will
buy
the
kegged
version
again
the
bottles
not
so
much
d
decent
although
i
suspect
too
many
would
give
me
heart
burn
all
in
all
not
a
bad
beer
id
drink
it
if
it
came
at
domestic
pricing
fairly
light
in
all
respects
smooth
not
hoppy
which
is
ok
by
me
and
quite
sweet
the
aftertaste
was
almost
candylike
not
exactly
my
favorite
quality
in
a
beers
aftertaste
but
inoffensive
nonetheless
drinkable
because
its
not
too
heavy
and
again
its
smooth
worth
a
try
if
youve
never
had
it
but
im
pretty
sure
it
wont
be
your
favorite
and
not
really
worth
going
out
of
your
way
to
get
decent
macro
lager
though
cheers
and
saaalute
my
ba
friends
d
not
very
tasty
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
theres
almost
always
something
else
that
i
would
pick
over
this
beer
no
matter
where
ive
been
theres
nothing
endearing
about
this
beer
that
would
make
me
want
to
drink
it
overall
much
blander
of
a
beer
than
i
expected
because
of
its
popularity
although
bud
is
popular
go
figure
vito
says
you
might
dig
heineken
but
more
than
likely
youll
conclude
that
heineken
isnt
worth
the
money
decide
for
yourself
while
certainly
not
the
greatest
european
lager
in
the
world
i
do
enjoy
a
heineken
from
time
to
time
usually
with
pizza
or
wings
or
at
a
restaurant
when
its
the
best
option
ill
be
sticking
to
bottles
or
tap
however
you
can
get
better
for
the
price
since
it
is
an
import
but
it
is
superior
to
a
bud
or
coors
or
that
kind
of
swill
the
color
is
about
average
for
a
lager
goldenyellow
and
clear
aroma
is
malty
and
not
strong
or
complex
flavor
is
crisp
and
refreshing
malty
with
just
a
touch
of
hop
edge
nothing
special
but
not
awful
either
it
goes
down
smoothly
and
easily
an
ok
beer
acceptable
if
nothing
better
is
available
in
my
younger
days
i
thought
this
was
a
really
good
beer
a
pale
yellow
color
pretty
carbonated
faint
grain
corn
aroma
virtually
no
taste
somewhat
refreshing
but
then
so
is
water
no
mystique
to
this
beer
it
probably
is
a
better
entrylevel
beer
than
bud
or
miller
but
not
one
id
want
to
drink
regularly
i
dont
know
why
so
many
people
go
out
for
this
beer
i
think
its
just
a
trendy
thing
to
do
to
like
heinies
i
found
this
beer
to
be
very
lacking
in
anything
substantive
it
was
a
little
over
carbonated
and
had
a
bad
after
taste
i
didnt
enjoy
it
that
much
at
all
i
had
several
during
this
wedding
reception
i
was
at
because
it
was
this
or
bud
light
i
dont
think
so
after
2
of
these
i
switched
to
wine
the
only
thing
positive
that
i
can
say
is
that
it
was
thrist
quenching
in
the
hotter
part
of
the
day
a
familiar
green
bottle
pours
a
pale
clear
straw
colour
with
a
tall
foamy
white
head
that
settled
soon
after
some
decent
lacing
remains
not
much
carbonation
smell
of
a
damp
basement
old
socks
but
not
offensive
is
that
a
hop
odour
in
there
somewhere
the
taste
is
mildly
hoppy
tart
and
sharp
mouthfeel
there
is
a
dry
refreshing
finish
that
is
altogether
too
abrupt
gives
a
cleansing
sensation
in
the
aftertaste
a
bit
astringent
at
times
a
long
time
favourite
with
many
beer
drinkers
on
the
pub
circuit
this
is
a
short
sharp
break
from
routine
drafts
but
not
too
many
people
with
alternatives
would
choose
to
drink
this
all
night
di
could
drink
a
few
of
these
all
the
time
it
felt
good
to
get
away
from
the
traditional
american
beers
plus
when
your
drinking
a
heineken
people
tend
to
notice
not
that
im
a
showboat
but
some
people
make
comments
heard
the
beer
at
the
brewery
in
amsterdam
is
one
hundred
times
better
but
they
only
let
you
have
about
four
ounces
when
i
see
this
listed
at
premium
prices
i
want
to
vomit
truly
a
nasty
foul
brew
that
if
you
put
in
a
more
noteable
u
s
macrobrew
label
would
be
fairly
undistinguishable
the
taste
is
bereft
of
any
hops
myabe
a
hint
of
malt
backbone
just
dreadful
bottom
line
its
not
horrible
its
a
good
lawnmowing
beer
and
it
does
contain
hops
which
i
cant
definitively
say
for
some
of
its
macrocompetition
best
of
the
swill
in
my
book
overall
a
mediocre
eurolager
if
i
were
to
drink
this
on
a
regular
basis
id
definitely
buy
the
minikeg
its
handy
and
easy
to
use
and
keeps
the
beer
fresh
heineken
is
nothing
special
but
theyre
on
to
something
with
the
minikeg

short

with

on

actually
very
fizzy
looking
as
carbonation
is
very
noticeable
in
the
glass
aroma
is
a
bit
lacking
not
the
typical
skunk
smell
from
out
of
the
bottle
due
to
the
green
bottle
letting
uv
light
effect
the
hop
isomers
creating
a
skunky
flavor
i
hear
they
now
purposely
expose
the
beer
to
uv
in
order
to
expedite
this
process
but
it
may
be
untrue
smells
malty
with
very
little
hop
aroma
tastes
like
it
smells
but
watered
down
however
i
like
this
aspect
along
with
the
fizzy
thin
mouthfeel
i
think
this
is
a
great
brew
to
drink
on
a
hot
summer
day
perfect
for
this
heatwave
in
socal
its
been
a
while
since
i
have
had
this
beer
but
from
what
i
remember
i
enjoyed
this
beer
it
was
a
pale
golden
color
with
a
bit
of
a
hoppy
taste
and
smell
all
in
all
it
was
a
good
beer
but
like
i
said
i
havent
had
it
in
a
while
and
i
would
probably
want
to
try
it
agian
just
to
be
100
sure
aroma
is
of
grain
and
skunk
taste
is
crisp
with
grain
followed
by
some
hop
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
thin
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
i
can
see
why
people
would
drink
this
but
i
wont
be
drinking
it
too
frequently
it
is
very
drinkable
light
can
be
refreshing
and
might
be
one
of
the
better
beers
available
in
some
bars
thankfully
i
havent
been
to
a
bar
that
heineken
was
the
best
available
overrated
because
it
was
one
of
the
first
widely
available
imports
and
was
better
than
miller
and
bud
better
on
tap
than
in
bottles
as
bottles
do
often
attain
a
skunkiness
thin
mouthfeel
and
fairly
high
carbonation
not
much
aroma
except
for
skunk
when
in
a
bottle
pours
yellow
with
head
that
doesnt
last
long
on
tap
served
in
a
23oz
lager
glass
this
pale
lager
poured
a
crystal
clear
golden
color
with
visible
carbonation
running
up
the
sides
of
the
glass
a
small
offwhite
head
dissappeared
almost
immediately
the
aroma
of
this
beer
consisted
of
grain
sweet
malts
and
some
skunky
hoppiness
i
was
a
bit
surprised
to
find
the
fairly
strong
skunkiness
since
this
was
not
a
bottle
the
flavor
was
mildly
dry
and
bitter
with
a
faint
lingering
skunky
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
was
lightbodied
and
heavily
carbonated
decent
enough
pours
a
light
yellow
color
with
a
nice
amount
of
foam
aroma
is
sweet
crisp
and
malty
dare
i
say
a
tad
bit
fruity
taste
is
much
of
the
same
with
the
sweetness
and
crispness
shining
through
aftertaste
is
somewhat
bitterdry
not
too
bad
goes
down
easy
still
a
whole
lot
better
than
most
american
macro
lagers
drinkability
is
something
to
be
desired
though
when
cold
it
is
quite
refreshing
and
i
imagine
would
go
marvelously
with
a
dog
or
some
wings
all
in
all
this
reminds
me
of
a
standard
party
lager
to
be
consumed
in
vast
quantities
by
people
who
dont
care
much
about
what
kind
of
beer
they
drink
pours
a
clear
light
yellow
color
with
decent
head
retention
and
little
lacing
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pilsner
glass
has
a
slight
malty
grainy
aroma
some
corn
little
hops
not
an
incredibly
tasty
beer
but
i
blame
much
of
this
on
the
style
itself
malted
corn
taste
to
is
mixed
with
alcohol
and
some
hops
has
a
light
mouthfeel
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
overall
an
alrigh
good
beer
considering
the
style
although
lighter
check
it
out
if
youre
into
it
mouthfeeldrinkability
after
a
horrific
piranhalike
attack
on
the
tongue
the
beer
eventually
smooths
out
and
becomes
pleasant
in
the
mouth
overall
a
weak
and
fake
selection
even
on
a
hot
day
d
if
every
heineken
were
like
this
one
id
give
it
a

this
is
hot
weather
beer
in
my
opinion
i
would
not
drink
it
in
the
winter
poured
from
the
green
bottle
into
a
glass
tumbler
at
a
friends
place
served
very
cold
lightpale
golden
color
with
a
skinny
thin
head
some
lacing
i
approached
it
objectively
but
it
still
had
the
usual
skunky
aroma
that
heineken
is
known
for
lightly
carbonated
detected
a
slight
grain
and
hop
aroma
the
flavor
was
lightly
bitter
with
a
slight
malt
flavor
and
a
touch
of
toastedovercooked
grain
which
eventually
smoothed
out
and
left
a
very
dry
cotton
mouth
feel
when
complete
heineken
is
not
very
drinkable
in
my
opinion
i
didnt
want
another
i
really
didnt
enjoy
it
the
smell
is
a
huge
turn
off
and
i
get
cotton
mouth
bummer
im
30000
feet
in
the
air
somewhere
over
pennsylvania
probably
and
this
beer
sucks
but
im
enjoying
the
hell
out
of
it
anyway
pours
a
straw
colored
body
clear
and
bubbley
that
leaves
a
thin
white
lace
that
is
stayed
only
from
the
carbonation
the
aroma
is
grain
husky
some
light
fruit
esters
but
really
not
much
going
on
the
taste
is
quality
some
crisp
citrus
like
mouthfeel
that
has
a
smooth
refreshing
finish
this
beer
brings
me
back
to
the
days
when
everyone
was
drinking
bmc
and
i
was
drinking
my
heineken
and
guinness
classic
beer
to
go
back
to
but
im
glad
i
moved
on
this
bottle
was
either
not
skunked
or
i
was
very
thirsty
poured
the
typical
very
light
goldenstraw
yellow
smell
of
very
slight
hops
but
i
poured
vigorously
so
i
could
smell
it
smell
faded
with
the
head
very
slight
taste
bitterness
then
a
quick
clean
finish
mouthfeel
was
like
drinking
a
soda
i
dont
like
soda
i
could
probably
drink
more
than
one
but
someone
left
only
one
at
the
house
my
first
heineken
in
many
years
nothing
objectionable
here
but
in
a
way
isnt
that
objectionable
not
much
to
like
either
pours
a
pale
yellow
color
with
a
quickly
diminishing
white
head
clear
body
with
medium
carbonation
hoppy
but
not
very
strong
smell
doesnt
really
taste
of
much
except
for
a
weak
taste
of
malt
short
finish
it
has
a
light
body
with
a
very
watery
mouthfeel
all
this
combined
makes
it
a
pretty
uninteresting
beer
simply
because
it
doesnt
taste
of
anything
d
the
skunk
really
hurts
this
one
i
could
get
if
it
was
a
single
bad
bottle
but
of
the
7
or
8
heines
ive
had
in
my
life
only
one
wasnt
skunked
and
even
then
it
wasnt
much
of
a
beer
so
im
reviewing
it
as
is
if
im
ever
in
the
netherlands
id
like
to
try
it
from
the
source
but
since
im
in
the
states
ill
only
drink
it
if
there
isnt
anything
else
available
this
beer
is
not
horrendous
if
its
in
a
can
but
in
a
bottle
its
the
biggest
crapshoot
out
there
the
draft
keg
does
prevent
the
lightstruck
skunkiness
that
many
of
the
green
bottle
beers
are
notorious
for
becks
is
the
worst
take
away
the
skunk
and
nothing
remains
whats
left
is
a
straw
colored
beer
with
a
fair
amount
of
head
composed
of
consistentlysized
bubbles
that
smells
a
bit
of
saaz
hops
and
tastes
like
straw
or
grass
and
leaves
a
sticky
film
in
my
mouth
even
from
this
package
which
has
to
be
a
high
point
for
this
beer
it
is
still
at
best
mediocre
and
imo
pilsner
urquell
remains
the
best
of
the
european
greenbottle
imports
its
been
a
long
time
since
ive
tried
a
heineken
its
wellknown
skunky
smelltaste
drove
me
away
long
ago
on
a
lark
i
grabbed
a
24
oz
can
to
enjoy
at
the
end
of
a
long
dayhike
the
difference
between
the
canned
and
bottle
versions
is
striking
the
skunkiness
so
prevalent
in
the
bottled
version
is
gone
making
this
one
enjoyable
highly
quaffable
brew
straw
colored
in
the
glass
it
has
a
wispy
white
head
that
doesnt
last
tealike
hops
and
grain
are
balanced
but
theres
not
a
lot
going
on
there
the
taste
is
slightly
sweet
but
the
tealike
hops
are
evident
as
well
one
of
the
few
brews
better
out
of
a
can
than
in
the
bottle
d
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
it
works
quite
well
as
a
lawnmower
beer
d
not
bad
it
would
make
a
good
session
beer
as
long
as
you
stay
away
from
the
bottles
the
beer
has
a
yellowchampagne
color
with
a
3
finger
head
which
reduced
with
no
lacing
on
a
ginger
pour
the
beer
has
a
skunky
hoppy
aroma
surrounding
it
and
is
followed
by
a
first
taste
of
grain
and
a
very
little
amount
of
warmth
very
carbonated
the
beer
goes
down
easy
but
just
has
a
skunky
taste
to
it
and
is
not
very
filling
dthis
just
tastes
of
skunk
even
on
tap
it
tastes
like
skunk
why
am
i
even
bothering
i
guess
i
have
too
much
time
to
kill
in
between
flights
this
reminds
me
of
what
beer
used
to
taste
like
before
i
discovered
the
good
stuff
from
my
notes

you

of
the
bars
it
is

ice
cold
which
killed
most
of
the
taste
at
the
heineken
brewery
amsterdam
nl
this
is
a
great
session
beer
as
well
as
a
good
one
to
win
one
over
then
to
imports
on
to
craft
beer
heineken
is
a
beer
that
i
expected
more
from
with
its
place
among
the
classic
beer
of
the
world
secure
lets
get
down
to
the
review
the
colour
is
a
straw
gold
colour
that
it
representative
of
so
many
north
american
style
lagers
the
aroma
is
slightly
hoppy
and
not
too
overpowering
the
taste
is
pretty
mild
with
nothing
to
really
distinguish
it
from
anything
else
not
a
bad
beer
but
it
isnt
a
favourite
of
mine
either
a
crowd
pleaser
and
generally
drinkable
d
i
could
drink
multiples
not
quite
a
session
beer
but
i
would
grab
one
of
these
on
a
hot
day
and
it
was
the
best
alternative
all
snobbiness
aside
not
bad
drinkability
the
keg
cans
are
so
much
better
than
the
bottles
its
ridiculous
but
theyre
still
not
worth
the

the
finish
fairly
drinkable
fairly
fullflavored
though
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
for
my
taste
decent
for
what
it
is
though
i
bought
a
keg
can
with
hopes
that
i
would
actually
try
a
heiney
without
the
skunk
poured
a
24oz
keg
can
into
a
22oz
tall
glass
pours
clear
with
little
head
and
no
lace
nothing
if
any
in
the
smell
department
and
no
shunk
good
on
the
skunk
part
so
i
thought
next
thing
i
noticed
is
that
the
beer
is
very
sweet
i
wonder
if
it
needs
the
skunky
flavor
to
cover
the
sweetness
other
than
sweet
nothing
comes
to
mind
to
discuss
mouthfeel
is
light
and
the
finish
is
sweet
for
me
i
dont
like
this
at
all
in
a
can
back
to
the
bottle
or
tap
if
i
have
heineken
this
beer
is
usually
over
priced
however
for
the
price
of
the
cask
my
buddy
mr
finnel
couldnt
go
wrong
this
is
an
easy
beer
to
kick
back
and
throw
down
as
far
as
being
a
complex
beer
for
someone
really
looking
for
a
great
brew
look
elsewhere
d
smooth
easydrinking
beer
to
be
expected
from
a
macro
not
bad
on
a
hot
day
or
if
the
bar
doesnt
have
a
decent
craftimport
selection
the
old
standby
here
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
lagers
but
when
i
want
something
cold
and
refreshing
this
is
where
i
go
the
appearance
is
almost
headless
crystal
clear
yellow
the
smell
and
taste
are
skunky
with
no
hint
of
hop
the
mouthfeel
is
weak
similar
to
others
in
class
the
drinkabilty
is
awesome
this
is
my
choice
for
session
love
it
this
is
truly
overrated
european
beer
and
the
dutch
could
do
so
much
better
the
smell
is
skunk
the
head
is
light
and
leaves
an
ugly
ring
in
the
glass
the
taste
is
bland
and
uninteresting
this
could
be
one
of
the
worst
beers
coming
from
such
a
wonderful
beercentric
part
of
europe
it
is
too
bad
this
is
the
beer
that
you
see
at
bars
and
package
stores
that
have
no
selection
and
at
weddings
where
you
have
choice
between
budweiser
miller
lite
amstel
and
heineken
they
add
this
crap
to
the
list
as
though
they
are
appealing
to
people
who
know
decent
beer
and
have
taste
unfortunately
its
european
budweiser
and
nothing
more
i
would
no
more
reach
for
this
than
i
would
a
dozen
or
so
other
crappy
american
macro
lagers

it
was
drinkable
but
the
taste
could
turn
you
off
not
a
great
beer
but
would
do
in
a
pinch
with
so
many
other
options
out
there
these
days
it
will
be
a
long
time
before
i
order
this
beer
again
this
stuff
is
good
only
if
you
dont
know
any
better
hey
assholes
the
skunk
aroma
is
not
intended
or
is
it
yeah
those
green
bottles
coming
from
thousands
of
miles
and
sitting
under
the
neon
lights
create
the
defining
charcter
of
this
beer
skunk
man
i
used
to
think
that
was
flavor
this
shit
is
better
out
of
the
can
if
you
must
drink
it
blonde
fizzy
and
a
little
more
light
malt
character
than
most
macros
i
dont
detect
any
adjuncts
in
this
beer
but
it
is
so
light
in
body
and
flavor
that
maybe
i
just
cant
tell
at
least
from
the
skunkiness
you
know
there
were
some
hops
in
this
beer
at
some
point
hey
dont
i
look
cool
in
the
club
with
my
heinie
i
spent
more
money
on
this
shit
bitches
come
give
me
some
overall
a
balanced
nice
lager
depending
on
where
i
am
i
will
chose
heineken
if
i
have
to
pick
between
this
one
and
a
selection
of
local
macro
lagers
i
could
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
and
be
very
happy
no
headache
so
far
pours
a
clear
yellow
with
a
nice
foamy
head
that
lingered
until
about
halfway
through
drinking
smells
very
hoppy
slightly
sweet
strongly
alcoholic
and
with
a
slight
hint
of
apple
slightly
skunked
started
very
hoppy
and
finished
crisply
and
very
alcoholic
overall
a
pretty
decent
lager
the
alcohol
is
very
easy
to
taste
sometimes
so
strong
it
masked
the
full
power
of
the
hops
not
incredible
but
an
acceptable
session
beer
and
good
value
andor
fallback
d
its
ok
heavier
than
their
girly
beer
flavored
water
probably
good
for
funnels
frat
parties
and
yuppies
not
really
anything
to
enjoy
here
cept
for
a
slight
buzz
overall
quite
drinkable
and
a
good
session
beer
fits
the
style
it
was
actually
better
than
i
expected
very
easy
to
drink
which
is
probably
why
so
many
do
not
much
daring
or
adventure
in
it
just
lift
drink
and
swallow
i
need
a
lager
with
more
taste
i
hate
the
fact
that
all
the
ignorant
hipsters
in
bars
think
this
is
a
german
beer
it
is
from
holland
hell
it
even
states
that
on
the
freakin
bottle
i
cant
see
why
this
is
all
that
popular
just
goes
to
show
you
what
a
good
marketing
campaign
can
accomplish
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
it
may
be
one
that
i
thought
was
the
best
at
a
young
age
but
things
change
and
we
learn
right
light
color
with
a
thin
head
that
is
gone
fairly
quick
the
smell
is
what
many
say
skunky
it
reminds
me
of
various
skunky
funky
things
and
i
like
it
the
smell
carries
over
into
the
taste
and
the
skunk
remains
which
isnt
quite
as
good
as
the
smell
definitely
crisp
and
smooth
even
still
i
could
easily
find
something
better
for
the
same
price
but
its
not
bad
to
have
a
few
of
these
after
a
hiatus
this
is
an
easy
to
find
easy
to
drink
beer
it
has
a
smooth
clean
taste
that
goes
down
easily
however
it
lacks
in
depth
and
has
a
skunky
smell
it
is
also
somewhat
pricey
for
what
you
are
getting
i
still
enjoy
heineken
but
for
my
money
id
rather
get
anchor
steam
or
sn
pale
ale
that
said
its
still
a
good
beer
to
try
its
also
a
good
beer
if
you
are
new
to
beer
its
not
too
aggressive
but
a
good
deal
better
than
alot
of
the
other
watery
options
its
great
if
someone
else
has
already
bought
it
but
at
8
50
a
six
pack
there
are
many
beers
that
are
much
higher
quality
and
cost
less
offerings
from
sam
adams
sierra
nevada
and
founders
come
to
mind
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
solid
yellow
with
a
good
half
inch
of
head
that
shinks
to
a
thin
white
film
light
lacing
in
spatters
aroma
is
not
so
bad
classic
pale
lager
with
herbal
tones
taste
is
similar
herbal
hops
are
pretty
nice
grains
and
a
little
citrus
a
respectable
mouth
to
go
along
with
it
i
remember
hating
this
beer
before
but
now
here
in
a
controlled
environment
not
so
bad
not
that
good
but
not
that
bad
ahh
and
old
stand
by
when
i
was
younger
and
hopefully
a
breath
of
fresh
air
is
this
mess
of
macros
this
had
long
neen
a
favorite
in
my
teens
years
i
want
to
see
if
it
can
stand
the
test
of
time
poured
a
decent
dark
yellow
almost
to
amber
color
but
no
quite
there
smallish
white
head
faded
pretty
quick
and
left
a
slight
lacey
film
along
the
top
lots
of
visible
carbonation
chains
of
bubbles
through
the
glass
smell
was
not
at
all
bad
decent
malt
presentation
light
grain
and
bread
a
little
bit
musty
but
at
least
had
some
character
taste
was
crisp
clean
and
refreshing
very
light
with
lots
of
carbonation
very
lively
feel
to
it
taste
was
a
classic
lager
very
thin
but
had
body
big
malts
with
nothing
to
really
balance
overall
this
was
the
best
of
the
bunch
i
have
tried
over
the
last
couple
days
check
my
last
couple
reviews
and
overall
was
not
that
bad
i
must
say
that
this
has
actually
withstood
some
scrutiny
pretty
average
beer
but
still
a
nice
change
from
bud
or
pbr
the
taste
out
of
a
can
is
not
too
skunky
at
all
its
actually
a
bit
sweet
bready
and
nonoffensive
its
also
watery
and
fizzy
but
i
can
live
with
that
heineken
was
always
one
of
my
least
favorite
macro
euro
beers
but
this
actually
isnt
terrible
from
now
on
when
i
have
to
drink
heiny
itll
be
out
of
a
can
this
beer
poured
with
a
head
1
finger
thick
and
a
dark
yellow
color
this
is
a
good
tasting
beer
that
you
can
keep
as
a
standby
a
lot
of
the
beer
snobs
wont
admit
to
it
because
it
is
a
macro
but
it
is
always
a
good
call
get
a
12
pack
because
six
just
wont
be
enough
pours
very
pale
gold
with
a
fine
fluffy
white
head
that
stood
tall
for
a
while
almost
no
aroma
a
little
hint
of
grain
thats
it
taste
is
wow
was
this
stuff
always
this
sweet
is
that
what
the
skunkyness
was
always
covering
up
a
bit
of
bitterness
on
the
finish
and
overall
a
bit
more
full
bodied
than
the
average
euro
macro
but
still
too
sweet
d
higher
than
expected
its
one
of
those
beers
that
for
some
reason
gets
a
lot
of
hype
but
you
could
drink
a
bunch
of
them
if
you
needed
to
nothing
particularly
offensive
but
definitely
nothing
great
here
areal
mass
beer
not
bad
but
not
for
beer
connaisseurs
hardly
any
bitterness
just
an
average
beer
for
the
masses
not
bad
but
also
nothing
outstanding
no
moreness
i
had
just
one
pint
no
desire
to
drink
a
second
one
i
rather
shifted
to
grolsch
afterwards
pours
the
typical
light
super
filtered
clear
golden
color
maintained
a
very
thick
slighty
rocky
head
far
longer
than
a
normal
heineken
has
a
slight
malty
aroma
and
no
skunk
a
light
buttery
taste
tagged
along
with
the
typical
euro
lager
also
to
me
heineken
has
always
had
that
skunk
to
it
but
this
special
bottle
i
could
not
notice
it
i
dont
know
if
it
was
the
cork
or
what
but
this
beer
seems
to
have
aged
superbly
especially
for
as
boring
a
beer
as
it
normally
is
i
bragg
about
the
champagne
bottle
being
superior
to
the
normal
12
oz
one
but
my
ratings
reflect
the
typical
normal
heineken
has
a
kick
to
color
ratio
like
no
other
i
get
a
lemon
zest
up
front
as
well
i
usually
leave
this
for
the
masses
not
bad
with
greek
food
real
cold
i
can
attest
a
refreshing
beer
served
cold
i
drink
if
there
is
nothing
better
maybe
i
havent
been
having
enough
beers
lately
but
for
some
reason
this
heineken
tastes
suprisingly
good
decent
hop
profile
makes
up
for
the
slightly
off
smell
the
taste
is
real
smooth
and
definitly
not
offensive
it
doesnt
really
look
that
bad
in
the
glass
nice
golden
hue
it
is
what
it
is
and
you
have
to
keep
that
in
mind
compared
to
budweiser
and
the
like
this
is
a
stand
out
but
saying
that
is
not
saying
much
again
this
has
slid
a
long
way
in
my
book
but
still
a
beer
i
can
enjoy
when
none
of
the
good
stuff
is
available
mouthfeel
isnt
anything
to
brag
about
simple
and
nice
refreshing
beer
actually
a
good
lager
theres
better
stuff
out
there
especially
from
the
dutch
is
the
green
bottle
myth
true
poured
out
of
a
24oz
keg
can
color
is
a
clear
yellow
with
a
decent
white
head
not
much
retention
or
lacing
faint
aroma
of
grain
taste
is
sweet
grain
not
too
much
there
pretty
clean
just
an
average
import
although
i
think
the
can
does
keep
a
the
skunkiness
out
of
this
beer
pours
a
clear
yellow
color
with
a
thick
foamy
head
the
head
then
very
quickly
disappears
there
was
bearly
any
smell
at
all
maybe
just
a
hint
of
hops
taste
was
very
boring
and
a
bit
skunky
best
thing
i
can
say
about
this
beer
is
that
its
smooth
so
at
least
it
goes
down
quick
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
beer
is
clearyellow
with
a
foamy
white
head
smell
is
of
corn
malt
slightly
skunky
taste
is
like
the
nose
with
a
small
amount
of
hops
to
balance
beer
is
lightmedium
bodied
with
little
carbonation
not
a
good
sign
when
the
best
characteristic
of
a
beer
is
its
mouthfeel
overall
this
beer
is
drinkable
but
in
my
opinion
overated
i
dont
know
what
all
the
buzz
is
about
this
beer
is
no
european
pale
ale
either
had
a
bottle
poured
into
a
glass
and
was
looking
forward
to
it
until
i
brought
it
to
my
nostrils
it
smelled
like
an
american
macro
bitter
and
watered
down
it
looked
like
a
light
beer
yellow
with
a
thin
white
head
that
did
not
really
retain
itself
throughout
the
beer
tasted
like
an
american
light
beer
as
well
same
with
the
mouthfeel
pretty
drinkable
if
you
want
a
light
beer
but
overall
i
was
not
impressed
with
this
beer
at
all
ive
had
this
from
cans
bottles
and
tap
and
i
generally
dont
recommend
it
in
the
bottle
definitely
have
this
again
out
of
the
keg
only
of
course
i
have
sinced
moved
on
to
other
prefered
styles
but
when
i
was
a
teenager
notably
as
a
16
yearold
travelling
in
greece
this
was
one
of
the
first
beers
that
i
enjoyed
and
actually
drank
for
the
flavour
if
it
mysteriously
appeared
in
my
fridge
id
drink
it
so
its
rated
above
sink
pour
d
pretty
damn
good
for
your
average
ubiquitous
restaurant
beer
something
good
to
get
at
the
steak
house
if
they
dont
have
any
sam
adams
or
guiness
imo
those
are
the
best
two
beers
that
you
can
find
anywhere
a
classic
every
time
i
enjoy
this
lager
i
am
reminded
that
it
wasnt
a
commercial
juggernaut
in
america
until
recently
the
aroma
is
skunky
a
standard
european
lager

the
netherlands

taste
is
predominately
on
the

side
there
is
some
corny
flavours
and
a
pleasant
floral
hop
note
as
well
its
all
pretty
tame
and
lacks
the
skunky
shenanigans
of
the
bottled
version
its
a
huge
difference
a
nice
euro
lager
aimed
at
the

drinkability
rates
higher
because
the

keep

moderately

the

this

no

for

i

as

detected
a

i
dont
like
how
a
lot
of
fans
mindlessly
bash
american
beer
while
they
drink
heineken
and
think
they
are
sophisticated
plus
they
do
not
pack
this
beer
well
in
the
bottle
which
is
my
personal
preferred
way
to
drink
beer
the
green
color
and
transatlantic
voyage
combine
to
skunk
this
beer
very
often
for
a
long
time
i
thought
this
was
the
absolute
worst
beer
made
because
i
only
had
it
from
the
bottle
i
dont
think
ive
had
a
nonskunked
bottled
heineken
yet
anyway
if
you
sample
it
from
a
nice
opaque
keg
instead
though
not
enough
to
make
you
think
they
purposely
brew
the
beer
to
taste
like
its
spoiled
like
in
the
bottle
there
was
also
a
nasty
aftertaste
that
kind
of
grew
as
i
got
further
down
in
the
glass
then
the
one
thing
i
can
say
to
improve
your
drinking
experience
is
dont
drink
it
from
the
bottle
if
you
like
bottled
heineken
you
should
save
your
money
and
drink
natural
ice
or
maybe
just
hairspray
oh
yeah
recommended
with
the
mexican
food

it

for

heineken
and

go
hand

a
little
watery
for
those
who
like
stronger
flavors
but
drinkable
and
refreshing
should
work
well
in
hot
weather
or
with
most
lighter
food
this
is
one
of
those
timeless
classics
ill
never
get
tired
of
the
appearance
i
find
is
not
unlike
that
of
most
european
lagers
smells
pretty
skunky
most
certainly
not
the
nicest
smelling
beers
it
does
however
taste
pretty
good
and
it
does
feel
nice
on
the
mouth
slightly
bitter
but
not
completely
overbearing
it
is
as
drinkable
as
other
beers
of
this
genre
overall
this
beer
isnt
really
exceptional
but
its
really
not
that
bad
either
certainly
worth
a
try
wow
a
truley
unimpressive
beer
heineken
pours
a
golden
straw
color
with
an
instantlyflattening
head
after
a
minute
there
was
no
head
to
be
found
at
all
and
it
looked
like
i
could
be
drinking
a
pint
of
apple
juice
smell
and
taste
are
strangly
metallic
with
a
hint
of
sweetness
tastes
sort
of
corney
too
i
find
it
amazing
how
widespread
and
popular
this
beer
is
great
marketing
i
guess
notes
i
havent
had
it
in
a
long
time
its
so
bland
thin
and
uninspiring
you
cant
help
but
feel
ripped
off
at
least
the
can
was
free
this
lager
is
a
big
commercial
brewer
trying
to
make
a
good
beer
and
making
a
typical
macro
seller
it
has
good
color
and
a
good
headbut
the
smell
is
screaming
of
skunk
i
enjoy
this
beer
for
summer
grillingbut
it
is
weak
alot
of
people
discount
this
beerbut
it
is
what
it
is
a
very
drinkable
beernot
goodbut
a
beer
to
get
drunk
on
a
slightly
deeper
gold
lager
color
than
i
expected
a
frothy
head
that
thins
quickly
but
i
still
cant
find
anything
resembling
a
taste
almost
a
total
lack
of
malts
and
a
very
slight
bitter
tone
instead
of
bitterness
nothing
off
about
it
but
also
nothing
that
makes
me
want
another
true
barley
pop
drinkability
when
im
in
the
right
mood
this
beer
can
be
really
satisfying
and
being
here
in
central
pa
i
often
find
myself
at
a
restaurant
with
the
choice
of
this
or
some
crappy
domestic
macros
and
this
is
usually
a
small
step
up
however
i
dont
think
the
step
up
from
macro
swill
warrants
the
heftier
price
tag
and
compared
to
other
euro
pales
out
there
there
are
better
ones
out
there
that
cost
less
such
as
aass
so
overall
i
find
this
beer
average
at
best
massive
1pt
sized
keg
can
oh
how
i
love
my
keg
cans
this
pours
a
piss
color
with
a
frickin
huge
airy
light
head
the
smell
isnt
skunky
like
i
mentioned
in
the
review
i
did
with
the
bottle
i
really
wonder
why
the
smell
is
actually
pleasant
sweet
and
malty
the
flavor
is
simple
a
little
hopyy
a
little
malty
and
sweet
jesus
never
get
this
in
bottle
form
i
actually
like
this
i
mean
it
is
no
microbrew
but
or
what
it
is
it
is
good
in
keg
can
form
very
drinkable
watery
mouthfeel
sampled
from
a
12oz
keg
shaped
can
poured
into
a
pint
glass
makes
a
clear
yellow
color
with
a
light
white
head
not
really
any
lacing
going
on
head
dissipates
quickly
aroma
is
light
caramel
malt
not
really
anything
else
going
on
here
and
i
am
honestly
surprised
to
see
anyone
call
this
beer
skunky
when
sampled
from
a
can
or
on
draft
in
my
experience
the
only
skunky
heineken
is
the
stuff
in
the
green
bottles
that
has
had
some
exposure
to
sunlight
flavor
is
clean
with
nearly
no
bittering
sweet
light
caramel
and
cream
with
a
slightly
fruity
finish
light
bodied
and
smooth
on
the
palate
spicy
carbonation
and
a
dry
finish
ill
only
drink
a
heineken
if
my
choices
are
severely
limited
and
never
when
served
from
a
green
bottle
i
really
wanted
to
dislike
this
beer
i
dont
not
in
the
can
at
least
i
enjoyed
this
brew
on
the
ferry
home
from
wall
street
nicely
chilled
from
a
sixteen
ounce
can
i
usually
smuggle
craft
brews
aboard
for
the
friday
ride
home
i
was
beerless
and
a
friend
was
buying
poured
a
pale
yellow
with
coarse
bubbled
shortlived
white
head
into
a
plastc
cup
aroma
was
pleasing
and
floral
with
hints
of
malt
dare
i
i
say
it
balanced
flavor
was
the
same
mild
balanced
some
floral
some
biscuity
malt
not
too
sweet
none
of
the
skunkiness
that
i
remebered
from
past
bottles
of
this
stuff
not
bad
stuff
this
beer
is
overrated
and
overpriced
i
would
call
this
a
good
beer
i
think
it
tastes
good
but
not
as
great
as
its
cracked
up
to
be
definetly
a
drinkable
beer
i
would
buy
it
again
i
drank
it
out
of
the
bottle
i
dont
know
why
all
beer
companies
dont
put
it
in
brown
bottles
i
guess
they
want
it
to
get
skunked

beer
wife
purchased
this
on

at
kroger
for

for
twelve
12
oz
bottles
heinekens
hops
are
its
success
both
the
aroma
and
flavor
deliver
a
combination
of
herbal
and
floral
hops
that
seperates
it
from
other
pilsners
its
got
a
decent
amount
of
bitterness
to
it
as
well
and
its
perfectly
balances
a
solid
mediumbodied
grainy
maltiness
it
finishes
dry
with
some
quickly
passing
lightly
sweet
malt
up
front
and
then
lingering
hops
amidst
a
dry
longlasting
bitterness
refreshing
satisfying
and
highly
drinkable
pours
a
straw
color
with
an
excellent
three
finger
head
exceptional
head
retention
and
lacing
even
for
a
euro
lager
the
smell
is
perhaps
more
hoppy
than
its
style
should
allow
but
the
quality
malts
blend
to
make
it
a
pleasent
bittersweet
aroma
taste
is
predictably
hoppy
again
a
poor
job
of
balancing
lightstruck
saaz
with
a
pale
malt
sweetness
even
for
euro
pale
accordingly
the
aftertaste
hinders
mouthfeel
which
would
otherwise
be
a
fairly
smooth
lighter
body
and
medium
carbonation
despite
the
overpowering
skunk
its
finish
is
smooth
boosting
drinkabilty
there
are
better
holland
lagers
less
expensive
than
this
import
i
was
looking
for
cans
to
try
and
avoid
the
skunk
aroma
but
only
found
the
evil
green
bottles
i
will
try
this
again
someday
when
i
work
up
the
courage
but
it
wont
be
from
a
bottle
ive
always
thought
heineken
was
the
best
massimport
but
havent
had
one
since
ive
been
rating
beer
here
goes
the
apperanace
is
decentlight
golden
yellow
a
small
bright
white
head
and
even
the
slightest
bit
of
lacing
smell
is
fairly
faint
some
grainy
malts
some
corn
a
little
skunkiness
flavor
is
much
better
than
the
smell
with
a
fairly
strong
smooth
maltiness
accented
by
a
detectable
hops
presense
a
suprise
for
a
macro
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
fizzy
overall
this
is
a
very
good
macro
but
the
fact
that
its
an
import
prices
it
more
like
a
craft
meaning
its
a
colossal
waste
of
money
mouthfeel
is
thin
with
tingling
bubbles
note
i
noticed
the
cap
they
used
was
not
an
oxygen
absorbing
cap
i
always
remember
this
beer
being
easily
skunked
i
wonder
if
that
is
why
beer
the
carbonation
is
too
weak
for
my
taste
but
i
have
to
saythere
isnt
any
alcohol
taste
so
thats
good
i
am
totally
unimpressed
with
this
one
but
i
dont
hate
it
now
i
realize
why
i
havent
had
one
of
these
for
years
if
i
must
have
a
heiny
make
it
a
dark
good
advertising
for
a
foreign
beer
but
really
just
another
mass
produced
money
maker
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
you
have
to
double
check
to
make
sure
the
mug
isnt
dirty
or
you
arent
drinking
it
out
of
some
old
gym
shoes
then
you
realize
you
are
drinking
it
straight
from
the
bottle
the
smell
is
bad
the
taste
is
bad
and
the
feel
is
weak
heck
im
surprised
people
still
buy
this
stuff
let
alone
that
it
was
once
such
a
popular
beer
taste
is
a
standard
lager
taste
to
methis
is
a
good
example
of
a
plain
gold
colored
easy
drinkin
beer
corn
and
malt
with
some
lemonny
essences
pretty
good

not
too
great

color
large
foamy
head
that
sticks
around
the
edge
of
the
glass
for
a
little
while
very
active
carbonation
that
causes
constant
bubbles
personally
i
cant
get
passed
the
euro
skunk
smell
once
you
get
that
smell
stuck
in
your
nose
the
taste
is
that
same
skunky
bitterness
slightly
watery
mouthfeel
with
lots
of
carbonation
giving
it
an
acrid
bite
overall
pretty
average
the
green
bottles
just
dont
do
anything
for
me
the
mouthfeel
is
light
but
clean
and
adds
to
the
drinkability
which
is
where
this
brew
scores
highest
theres

head
its
flat

bumpy
the
beer
underneath
is
extremely
clear
and
bright

there
are
strings
of
carbonation
aroma
is
sugar
and
nuts
not
bad
the
front
is

sweet
the
middle
is
a
fairly
nice
fruity
milkiness
apples
in
the
end
its
quite
bitter
nutty
fruity
a
little
chemically
with
some
alcohol
you
know
this
isnt
a
bad
euro
lager
theres
a
fair
amount
of
taste
very
fruity
with
a
fresh
finish
nice
hop
crispness
fancy
can
euro
name
kind
of
a
boring
beer
taste
is
probably
superior
to
most
macros
but
not
by
much
more
watery
than
i
like
from
a
premium
lager
pours
a
translucent
gold
color
with
a
little
head
when
poured
correctly
smell
is
very
pungent
right
off
the
bat
with
wheat
and
hops
pretty
inviting
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
smell
with
strong
hops
and
wheat
with
a
slightly
malty
finish
there
is
a
certain
graininess
to
it
that
comes
from
the
abundance
of
wheat
a
great
beer
if
you
are
looking
to
have
a
few
or
are
just
kicking
back
and
relaxing
a
clear
pale
yellow
color
with
a
white
lace
for
a
head
smells
like
grains
and
cooked
veggies
light
carbonated
mouthfeel
grainy
taste
some
grassy
flavors
and
faint
hops
very
clean
finish
with
a
good
drinkability
all
around
an
average
euro
lager
but
not
worth
the
price
though
boy
one
of
the
premium
beers
on
american
airlines
decent
golden
yellow
filtered
pour
with
a
white
head
that
actual
left
some
glass
lacing
a
small
malt
aroma
can
be
detected
behind
a
little
of
the
ol
european
sulfur
skunk
taste
was
a
little
weak
and
thin
but
some
decent
malt
and
grain
flavors
made
their
way
through
ok
give
me
a
couple
more
what
a
horrid
description
of
this
beer
its
actually
quite
nice
though
for
a
euro
lager
nothing
great
just
decent
the
hops
and
malt
are
bigger
than
your
average
american
lager
that
makes
you
realize
why
so
many
people
consider
this
quality
but
basically
its
just
overall
this
is
pretty
good
as
macro
beers
go
i
give
it
a
thumbsup
the
beer
poured
a
pale
yellow
with
a
bit
of
white
head
its
aroma
was
lightly
of
malt
and
hops
the
taste
was
pretty
indistinguished
it
had
a
bit
of
malt
and
hops
in
it
and
not
much
else
it
was
pretty
subdued
it
was
light
bodied
i
wouldnt
purchase
one
but
wouldnt
try
to
avoid
one
either
the
keg
can
is
one
heck
of
a
novelty
item
and
the
beer
isnt
all
that
bad
compared
to
its
neighbors
in
macroville
looking
inhouse
i
have
tasted
worse
cans
of
heineken
but
this
was
better
than
most
i
would
highly
suggest
drinking
rolling
rock
over
this
beer
on
tap
at
a
local
wing
joint
even
from
the
keg
this
has
the
typical
green
beer
taste
smells
and
tastes
slightly
skunky
but
from
memory
it
is
less
so
from
the
keg
than
the
can
still
it
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
refreshing
and
pairs
well
with
the
spicy
wings
better
than
many
of
the
bmc
offerings
that
were
available
verdict
i
guess
its
not
that
bad
as
long
as
its
ice
cold
but
god
help
you
if
it
starts
to
warm
up
drinkability
definately
the
drink
of
choice
in
a
club
drink
heineken
over
corona
anyday
yeah
not
a
top
notch
drop
this
one
very
standard
and
reasonably
unlikeable
there
are
far
better
lagers
out
there
heres
the
caveat
this
was
tasted
freshly
poured
from
a
cold
bottle
over
time
and
as
it
warms
theres
no
question
that
this
beer
deteriorates
a
bit
after
30
minutes
of
sitting
out
it
degrades
to
a
bottom
of
the
pile
lager
but
lets
give
credit
where
credits
due
they
made
me
eat
my
words
henies
fine
by
me
when
its
nice
and
cold
drinkability
i
cant
stand
more
than
one
bottle
per
event
two
is
risky
and
three
or
more
is
pure
danger
too
foamy
too
much
skunky
and
its
chemical
taste
turns
my
stomach
upside
down
very
quickly
us
budweiser
is
much
better
than
heineken
for
a
macro
the
skunkiness
really
makes
this
lager
tough
to
drink
a
lot
of
imo
another
case
of
the
power
of
marketing
overall
impression
better
than
most
heinekens
ive
had
before
but
nothing
to
make
me
want
another
i
am
reviewing
a
chilled
sample
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
very
light
yellow
with
a
2
in
bleached
white
fluffy
head
with
large
craters
foaming
up
and
fading
quickly
a
slight
skunk
aroma
is
present
on
pour
but
fades
through
sampling
some
caramel
and
grainy
malt
is
present
on
the
nose
as
well
first
sip
reveals
a
light
body
with
small
and
gentle
carbonation
flavor
is
mild
but
crisp
with
some
grainy
malt
and
some
spicy
hops
intertwining
nicely
the
finish
is
clean
and
a
little
empty
where
did
that
beer
go
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
you
could
drink
lots
of
them
in
a
sitting
i
would
choose
not
to
22oz
keg
can
picked
up
when
i
stopped
for
smokes
i
have
to
say
the
keg
can
was
a
great
decision
on
heinekens
part
this
was
my
favorite
beer
for
a
looong
time
before
i
encountered
ba
and
such
the
keg
can
enables
me
to
actually
enjoy
one
of
these
from
time
to
time
that
isnt
a
skunky
piece
of
shit
i
poured
this
out
into
a
tall
pilsner
glass
it
looks
like
a
good
pale
lager
should
crystal
clear
straw
colored
light
carbonation
moving
through
the
body
a
nice
head
is
produced
doesnt
have
the
best
retention
or
leave
any
real
lace
but
no
biggie
let
me
say
again
how
nice
it
is
to
have
a
heineken
that
doesnt
smell
like
skunkspray
it
lets
the
fact
that
it
does
have
a
bit
of
character
be
revealed
the
malt
on
the
nose
is
like
buttered
sourdough
spicy
green
hop
aromas
are
present
as
well
the
flavor
comes
across
a
bit
sweeter
than
i
remember
it
beingsame
light
butterybiscuit
flavor
that
i
picked
up
in
the
nose
little
spicy
hop
in
the
finish
its
really
light
slick
and
finishes
really
clean
i
can
see
the
appeal
to
the
less
educated
crowd
the
flavor
is
a
lot
lighter
than
i
remember
as
well
leaves
me
wanting
a
little
more
even
from
a
pale
lager
i
still
stand
by
the
fact
that
is
a
decent
beer
and
heineken
gets
its
propers
for
the
keg
can
an
especially
good
beer
for
washing
down
food
a
true
session
beer
not
other
reason
to
drink
this
stuff
looks
surprisingly
nice
coming
out
of
the
bottle
pours
with
a
decent
head
and
an
ok
color
but
then
comes
the
aroma
and
worst
of
all
the
taste
i
dont
pick
up
a
lot
of
the
rice
flavor
that
other
people
seem
to
notice
corn
however
in
abundance
in
this
one
a
really
good
brew
horribly
underrated
due
to
its
omnipresence
in
the
marketplace
crystal
clear
yellowgold
firm
white
head
firm
hop
fragrance
maltier
than
anticipated
well
balanced
with
a
nice
hop
bite
at
the
end
everything
you
expect
out
of
a
good
pilsner
very
dependable
but
yes
pricey
this
beer
is
far
from
good
it
isnt
that
bad
either
its
bitter
to
start
but
that
isnt
always
bad
it
is
a
popular
beer
and
it
is
a
step
up
from
the
bud
and
coors
line
of
beers
so
it
give
it
credit
for
that
but
it
falls
far
short
of
a
beer
i
would
drink
regularly
once
you
get
past
the
biterness
it
has
a
steady
refined
flavor
not
wonderfull
but
not
swill
im
sure
it
must
taste
better
in
europe
fresh
overallthere
are
reasons
why
this
beer
sells
so
well
and
in
this
case
i
cant
blame
it
all
on
image
heineken
is
an
extremly
smooth
euro
lager
and
while
it
doesnt
have
a
bold
flavor
it
has
enough
to
carry
it
over
while
going
well
with
just
about
anything
dont
expect
to
be
floored
like
this
like
you
would
other
beers
but
expect
to
be
relaxed
and
calmed
by
this
smooth
and
wellcrafted
if
overpriced
lager
bought
a
24
oz
bomber
of
this
out
of
impulse
at
a
convenience
store
i
remember
when
i
first
started
drinking
beer
early
highschool
people
always
said
heineken
was
good
but
i
never
enjoyed
it
tonight
im
giving
it
a
second
chance
appearance
isnt
too
shabby
color
is
golden
yellow
head
is
about
average
size
but
quickly
dissapates
a
wave
of
skunkiness
hits
as
soon
as
the
bottle
is
uncapped
thankfully
this
smell
almost
disappears
completely
after
the
initial
whiff
the
remaining
aroma
is
grainy
with
a
bit
of
light
sweetness
taste
is
grainy
and
balanced
nothing
too
exciting
here
but
no
major
detractions
a
little
taste
of
sweetness
pops
out
at
the
end
of
the
sip
i
liked
heineken
much
more
this
time
around
but
it
still
isnt
a
great
beer
its
overpriced
too
i
can
finding
cheaper
imitations
that
actually
taste
better
ill
only
drink
this
in
the
canned
form
if
this
is
fresh
and
in
a
can
this
isnt
all
that
bad
also
the
skunkiness
isnt
in
full
effect
in
the
can
verison
my
friend
swears
by
this
beer
while
i
dont
share
his
passion
i
cant
totally
hate
on
this
pours
a
pale
ass
crystal
straw
color
almost
like
the
consistency
of
water
but
just
a
little
more
tainted
there
is
a
nice
white
head
that
forms
but
it
quickly
recedes
without
leaving
the
slightest
hint
of
lace
on
the
glass
aromas
are
quite
simplistic
for
this
brew
showing
off
just
a
faint
hint
of
bready
malt
a
limey
citrus
consistency
of
hops
and
something
else
which
doesnt
make
me
excited
at
all
im
going
with
something
between
metal
and
skunk
but
i
cant
just
put
a
finger
on
it
for
flavor
this
beer
is
extremely
crisp
with
a
grassy
hop
flavor
and
just
a
slight
bit
of
biscuity
malt
tones
there
is
honestly
more
flavor
in
this
brew
from
the
carbonation
i
feel
than
from
the
malts
and
hops
but
heck
it
is
smooth
the
finish
to
this
brew
is
just
faintly
bitter
with
just
a
slight
hop
presence
the
mouthfeel
to
this
brew
is
extremely
light
and
the
carbonation
creates
a
decently
effervecent
quality
to
this
brew
overall
very
quaffable
so
i
understand
why
people
can
do
keg
stands
of
this
shit
but
aside
from
that
i
just
dont
understand
it
sitting
at
the
kof
c
with
a
friend
did
not
have
a
big
choice
but
to
order
this
the
only
one
that
sounded
half
way
good
poured
golden
with
a
white
head
aroma
malts
wheat
corn
malts
flavor
a
sweetness
but
can
not
figure
out
hat
it
is
malts
hops
i
guess
this
would
be
a
good
beer
to
have
with
burgers
or
pizza
or
just
to
slam
a
few
mouthfeel
was
all
right
drinkability
yeah
but
only
if
nothing
else
was
available
it
has
a
nice
hoppy
flavor
and
an
excellent
finish
light
and
refreshing
in
the
caribbean
it
sometimes
comes
in
250
ml
baby
bottles
which
is
about
a
half
pint
at
the
airport
in
sint
maartin
they
are
only
1
so
i
had
a
few
to
make
my
flights
back
to
the
states
more
pleasant
in
the
shadows
of
the
wildly
successful
halloween
party
in
which
people
obviously
spent
a
lot
time
on
their
costumes
im
certain
the
green
sticker
of
heineken
had
some
gravitational
pull
the
truth
behind
that
green
facade
was
that
of
an
average
beer
served
to
partyminded
masses
dancing
to
70s
disco
and
rock
hits
until
midnight
drinkability
extremely
drinkable
but
not
enough
to
make
up
for
its
other
short
comings
you
are
better
off
saving
your
money
and
buying
something
a
bit
cheaper
never
really
a
fan
of
heineken
due
to
the
cost
versus
other
typical
pale
lagers
however
this
was
free
last
night
so
maybe
it
just
tasted
better
that
way
nicer
appearance
than
most
light
beer
kept
a
head
longer
and
pretty
good
lacing
around
the
glass
im
trying
to
compare
this
to
its
style
which
is
not
my
favorite
therefore
i
think
its
better
than
most
but
you
still
wont
catch
me
buying
it
drinkability
not
a
bad
session
beer
except
for
its
blandness
i
havnt
had
a
heineken
in
ages
so
i
figured
id
give
it
a
shot
left
behind
by
houseguests
it
has
never
really
been
a
favorite
poured
a
pale
golden
color
with
a
slight
head
that
was
gone
quickly
it
has
the
same
sulfury
smell
that
i
have
always
assocoated
with
heineken
wouldnt
call
it
skunked
more
chemical
like
crisp
taste
though
very
metallic
ok
body
for
the
style
nothing
too
speciali
have
never
seen
the
appeal
in
this
beer
i
dont
think
i
ever
drank
it
on
a
regular
basis
growing
up
to
be
trendy
give
me
a
budmgd
or
hell
even
an
old
milwaukee
over
this
any
day
tried
the
24oz
keg
can
it
poured
a
medium
gold
with
a
clean
white
head
that
quickly
dissipated
the
aroma
was
an
old
fashioned
beery
smell
that
could
have
come
from
an
adjunct
lager
flavor
was
fairly
good
with
balanced
malt
and
hops
hops
were
assertive
enough
to
make
this
mildly
interesting
aftertaste
was
mildly
bitter
overall
not
a
bad
beer
maybe
a
step
above
michelob
but
certainly
not
in
the
same
league
as
a
sam
adams
at
14
a
12
pack
it
is
overpriced
730
we
picked
this
up
on
vacation
in
the
keg
cans
i
was
always
aware
of
the
skunkness
factor
so
i
was
shy
on
thisone
it
poured
a
clear
pale
straw
color
that
brought
forth
a
average
white
head
that
didnt
stick
around
or
to
anything
no
lace
was
to
be
had
carbonation
took
the
head
in
a
low
level
fiz
left
was
a
gold
brew
that
looked
abit
flat
the
aroma
was
of
grain
sulpher
and
metal
the
taste
carried
that
sulphery
metal
husk
mellowed
by
a
sweet
malt
a
slight
hop
bitterness
only
dried
the
finish
overall
it
was
all
i
could
get
at
the
time
it
goes
down
easy
on
a
hot
evening
but
not
one
i
would
order
if
given
more
of
a
choice
its
been
a
while
since
i
last
had
this
one
again
one
of
these
was
in
my
fridge
after
a
weekend
of
people
over
at
my
house
the
beer
pours
a
clear
pale
yellow
with
about
a
finger
of
head
that
falls
to
a
sparse
covering
over
the
beer
the
nose
is
a
bit
more
complex
than
others
ive
had
that
i
put
in
the
same
league
there
is
the
requisite
malty
sweetness
but
i
get
just
a
hint
of
hop
hiding
in
there
as
well
this
is
not
my
favorite
ut
its
definately
not
bad
the
dominant
flavor
is
just
sweetness
but
there
is
a
decent
bite
from
hops
that
linger
just
a
bit
on
the
side
of
my
tongue
the
beer
is
thin
to
moderate
with
a
good
carbonation
i
am
not
the
biggest
fan
of
the
light
lager
beers
so
the
flavor
just
doesnt
grab
me
and
keep
my
interest
one
of
these
every
so
often
when
it
is
left
after
a
party
is
enough
for
me
after
its
evacuation
from
the
12ounce
green
bottle
it
resides
in
the
glass
unblured
gold
with
a
personable
sized
bright
white
foamy
head
and
as
it
dissolves
the
lace
forms
a
thin
sheet
upon
the
glass
malt
dominated
nose
sweet
and
crisp
with
the
start
sweet
and
the
malt
adequate
the
top
skeletal
in
feel
finish
is
reasonably
acidic
the
hops
standard
fair
and
the
aftertaste
dry
drinkable
for
beer
and
there
are
certainly
worse
lagers
on
the
market
well
i
cant
really
say
youre
missing
much
if
youve
never
had
a
heineken
i
suppose
i
was
doing
the
beertasting
equivalent
of
slumming
on
this
one
but
my
only
other
option
at
the
time
was
warm
beer
and
i
wasnt
not
in
germany
this
brew
has
practically
no
noteworthy
characteristics
except
for
an
exceptionally
smooth
feel
and
a
biting
aftertaste
the
appearance
and
smell
are
bland
and
somewhat
monotonal
it
starts
sharp
and
clear
with
a
very
slight
metallic
flavor
this
beer
is
light
bodied
and
has
a
sort
of
wheat
or
grain
taste
throughout
finish
is
much
smoother
than
the
rest
of
the
beer
and
it
leaves
a
distinct
weight
and
papery
feeling
on
the
tongue
in
a
beer
crisis
reach
for
this
green
bottle
otherwise
defer
to
quality
not
quantity
its
been
awhile
since
i
had
a
heinie
but
here
goes
it
poured
a
pale
golden
slight
head
no
lacing
im
trying
to
distinguish
a
smell
here
but
a
sweet
grainyness
is
all
i
get
taste
is
same
sweet
grains
with
a
dry
crisp
end
very
carbonated
i
suppose
the
drinkability
on
these
would
be
pretty
high
but
personally
there
are
a
lot
more
beers
id
rather
suck
down
than
this
one
its
amazing
to
me
how
many
people
think
that
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
fair
is
the
best
i
can
say
this
is
my
beer
when
i
go
out
and
i
have
the
choice
between
a
molson
dry
or
heineken
you
guess
it
right
clear
pale
gold
strawlike
colour
with
bright
white
head
the
aroma
was
predominantly
of
sulfur
and
skunk
not
much
else
could
get
through
sharp
flavour
to
start
with
some
sweetness
sulfur
and
a
light
bitterness
evident
dry
finish
with
little
aftertaste
light
body
quite
fizzy
not
a
great
amount
of
flavor
but
no
bad
flavors
not
my
cup
of
tea
as
i
dont
care
for
the
real
dry
almost
sourish
finish
to
be
honest
id
rather
drink
miller
or
pabst
any
day
appearance
was
golden
with
a
one
inch
head
that
left
no
lacing
you
could
smell
the
skunk
from
10
feet
away
as
the
server
brought
it
to
our
table
taste
started
as
lightly
skunked
and
finished
with
a
light
dry
hop
finish
mouthfeel
was
very
thin
overall
drinkabilty
is
barely
tolerable
decent
for
a
hot
desert
afternoon
this
is
a
thouroughly
average
beer
its
appearance
is
that
of
a
typical
macro
lager
it
is
a
straw
yellow
with
minimal
lace
it
is
on
the
light
side
of
medium
bodied
it
has
a
bit
of
a
skunky
taste
but
the
taste
is
not
unpleasant
overall
this
is
a
beer
that
i
would
rarely
drink
unless
i
was
in
a
pinch
drinkability
okay
i
guess
id
certainly
prefer
it
over
the
macrobrews
but
there
are
some
much
better
lagers
out
there
comes
in
a
rather
stubby
greenish
hued
glass
bottle
pours
clear
light
amber
hue
very
carbonated
with
a
thick
head
that
does
not
dissipate
too
quickly
its
smell
is
more
of
a
stench
of
hops
mixed
with
alcohol
and
some
animal
byproducts
once
you
get
past
the
smell
the
taste
is
mediumstrong
with
bitter
overtones
hops
and
alcohol
again
it
is
surprisingly
smooth
for
its
taste
at
least
it
has
oomph
also
quite
filling
overall
this
is
a
very
average
if
not
a
belowaverage
european
lager
its
definitely
not
recommended
though
it
beats
american
canadian
and
mexican
macrolagers
anyday
this
is
a
very
decent
hot
weather
lager
beer
though
there
are
much
better
ones
available
and
ones
not
as
overpriced
and
grossly
overhyped
as
this
one
everything
that
is
wrong
with
mass
brewed
beers
can
be
seen
in
one
bottle
of
heineken
avoid
like
the
plague
ng
never
had
a
good
beer
in
a
green
bottle
and
this
lager
is
no
difference
it
had
a
pale
yellow
color
with
a
little
bit
of
white
foam
and
no
lace
the
taste
had
a
bitter
bite
that
was
sort
of
unpleasant
for
my
palate
the
smell
was
grainy
and
had
no
depth
to
the
flavor
or
aroma
this
is
one
beer
that
may
be
good
on
a
hot
day
when
you
just
gulp
to
cool
down
and
worry
about
flavor
from
the
can
this
is
a
light
golden
color
i
drank
this
out
of
the
can
which
i
know
is
wrong
so
forgive
me
i
could
still
smell
the
skunkyness
of
the
beer
i
have
never
had
a
heineken
that
was
not
skunky
smelling
tastes
slightly
grainy
but
very
sweet
there
was
a
slight
hop
bitterness
and
i
mean
slight
very
thin
body
and
heavy
on
the
carbonation
overall
this
is
not
the
worst
in
the
world
it
did
quench
my
thirst
after
a
round
of
golf
but
i
just
cant
get
past
the
smell
i
would
probably
pass
unless
i
was
desperate
watery
boring
overpriced
it
tastes
good
in
amsterdam
yes
but
i
dont
know
if
thats
because
of
a
recipe
difference
or
well
overall
this
is
an
absolute
horrible
beer
it
is
a
beer
to
use
for
drinking
games
only
this
beer
should
cost
half
the
price
i
cant
believe
this
beer
is
getting
a
2
5
sure
its
not
the
best
beer
out
there
but
it
beats
most
imports
and
just
about
every
macro
it
is
a
little
skunky
but
in
a
good
way
not
something
to
drink
everyday
but
i
have
a
couple
extra
bucks
to
splurge
on
booze
its
always
high
on
my
list
drinkability
i
give
heiny
a
high
drinkability
rating
cause
it
just
goes
down
so
damn
easy
its
taste
is
more
than
o
k
slighty
above
average
but
still
as
ive
said
plenty
of
times
nothing
special
heineken
just
goes
down
without
a
problem
impressions
why
do
people
bring
me
this
for
parties
time
to
stop
the
byob
policy
this
must
be
consumed
cold
to
miss
the
funkiness
on
draught
at
chez
bernard
in
fontainebleau
france
someone
had
suggested
trying
a
heineken
on
my
trip
which
i
planned
on
not
doing
but
due
to
my
poor
french
speaking
i
ended
up
with
one
at
lunch
one
day
i
literally
had
to
ask
the
waiter
what
i
was
drinking
to
be
sure
even
though
it
was
served
in
a
heineken
glass
i
was
assured
in
answer
to
my
questce
que
sappelle
that
it
was
indeed
heineken
wow
looks
the
same
but
the
taste
is
definitely
different
clear
gold
with
a
medium
white
head
and
little
lacing
the
nose
is
lightly
hoppy
with
a
pleasant
grape
character
very
smooth
body
with
a
fruity
and
hoppy
flavor
that
just
somehow
tastes
like
this
beer
really
should
it
all
makes
sense
now
the
finish
is
refreshing
and
vinous
with
a
touch
of
hops
one
of
the
only
good
beer
surprises
on
my
trip
crystal
clear
straw
with
a
pure
white
foamy
head
that
disappears
to
nothing
light
aroma
of
cooked
grain
and
slight
skunkiness
light
bodied
and
crisply
carbonated
obviously
going
for
zesty
lightly
sweet
overcooked
ceral
flavor
with
hints
of
lemony
hopiness
hops
are
vauge
finshes
with
that
trademark
skunky
aftertaste
i
had
this
many
times
on
draft
in
holland
and
it
was
much
better
there
where
it
was
presumably
much
more
fresh
doesnt
travel
well
i
suppose
this
best
serves
as
a
thirstquencher
or
a
placeholder
when
nothing
better
can
be
found
its
best
attributes
are
wide
distribution
and
betterthangarbage
quality
bottle

poured
a
blond
type
brew
with
minimal
head
with
below
standard
retention
aroma
is
in
part
skunky
with
some
touch
of
malt
carbonation
is
below
average
taste
is
really
light
with
again
that
bit
of
skunky
taste
coming
out
overall
this
is
not
a
great
beer
but
probably
on
the
same
level
as
those
american
macros
and
i
also
believe
we
dont
get
the
same
version
they
produce
overseas
which
is
probably
a
shame
it
is
drinkable
for
the
whole
game
joey
this
beer
frustrates
me
mainly
its
because
many
friends
of
mine
consider
this
a
good
beer
worth
paying
a
premium
for
when
in
fact
this
beer
possesses
no
remarkable
characteristics
whatsoever
ill
admit
this
beer
is
quite
drinkable
but
that
stems
mostly
from
its
plain
taste
and
the
extra
cold
temperature
it
is
typically
served
at
pouring
a
plain
yellow
with
slight
head
this
beer
basically
has
a
crisp
clear
and
boring
smell
to
it
though
you
can
taste
the
hops
in
there
i
highly
recommend
almost
any
czech
lager
over
this
bore
fest
nothing
remarkable
to
speak
of
here
very
easy
to
drink
if
you
dont
care
what
your
beer
tastes
like
if
youre
feeling
frisky
and
looking
to
whap
back
a
case
of
beer
go
for
natty
light
its
much
cheaper
and
you
wont
be
missing
out
on
quality
pours
golden
yellow
with
a
slight
head
that
disappears
after
a
few
minutes
smells
like
nothing
special
just
your
regular
european
lager
the
taste
is
slightly
hoppy
but
is
pretty
bland
the
only
real
good
thing
about
this
beer
is
that
it
is
easy
to
drink
a
lot
of
and
i
always
seem
to
get
pretty
drunk
when
i
drink
heiney
light
body
sweet
pretty
easy
beer
to
drink
tastes
good
and
is
easy
to
go
down
could
easy
drink
a
few
tastes
pretty
good
but
overall
its
just
an
average
beer
so
why
did
i
try
this
again
knowing
what
i
knew
well
from
my
younger
days
because
i
believe
that
to
truly
appreciate
the
good
you
have
to
understand
the
bad
and
while
this
is
far
from
the
worst
its
bad
enough
to
give
some
kind
of
baseline
that
aroma
check
that
that
smell
is
something
i
could
never
get
around
even
years
ago
when
drinking
it
was
considered
hip
and
enlightened
now
if
i
could
hold
my
nose
while
drinking
it
would
indeed
be
drinkable
because
it
is
light
and
crisp
but
i
just
cant
live
with
that
smelly
critter
under
my
nose
gone
are
the
days
when
i
could
drink
this
to
try
to
look
cool
im
old
with
kids
and
a
mortgage
im
drinking
what
i
like
now
and
this
is
not
it
white
head
on
this
yellow
lager
quickly
disappears
faint
citrusy
smell
with
another
slightly
fruity
smell
that
wierd
faint
skunky
smell
is
there
too
pretty
standard
euro
lager
aromas
i
dont
really
smell
any
hops
tangy
citrusy
with
almost
some
sort
of
vegetable
flavors
just
enough
hops
to
say
that
theyre
their
mouthfeel
is
sort
of
watery
with
tingling
carbonation
on
the
tongue
drinkability
is
average
or
even
below
for
the
discriminating
beer
drinker
but
i
feel
that
there
is
a
time
and
place
in
which
it
could
be
higher
a
warm
summer
day
for
instance
i
enjoyed
drinking
it
sort
of
like
i
like
to
drink
soda
this
is
like
any
mass
produced
and
over
marketed
eurolager
it
pours
a
bright
golden
yellow
the
taste
is
a
little
watery
and
it
has
some
soury
citrus
to
it
very
little
hints
of
hops
or
malt
but
just
enough
to
pass
as
beer
overall
a
beer
that
i
wouldnt
choose
if
i
didnt
have
to
heineken
is
usually
the
best
of
a
bad
choice
of
beers
for
me
i
hadnt
one
in
a
while
but
was
kind
of
forced
to
drink
nothing
or
heineken
at
a
jersey
shore
establishment
that
was
not
prepared
for
a
crowd
on
a
warm
winter
day
heineken
pours
the
same
clear
yellow
as
any
massproduced
lager
with
a
little
quickly
departing
head
and
no
lacing
it
smells
of
old
alcohol
and
a
little
of
the
barley
the
taste
is
not
awful
by
massproduced
lager
standards
but
it
is
very
thin
and
almost
watery
in
the
mouth
the
taste
is
definitely
beer
but
not
much
more
distinct
than
that
if
it
had
been
heineken
on
tap
it
would
have
been
more
drinkable
i
had
one
and
left
to
find
a
bar
that
had
better
beer
happening
upon
one
that
was
ready
was
doing
10
times
the
business
and
had
a
wide
selection
of
beers
on
tap
while
being
faced
with
a
choice
of
drinking
no
beer
heineken
or
a
us
macro
id
always
choose
heineken
thats
what
i
did
last
night
and
what
i
got
was
a
nondescript
euro
lager
with
no
overly
offensive
characteristics
pale
clear
color
with
bubbly
artificial
carbonation
thin
white
head
is
very
short
lived
aroma
is
clean
to
grassy
with
little
touch
of
hops
and
due
to
the
bottle
having
been
protected
no
skunk
taste
is
dominated
by
grainy
malts
but
is
not
sweet
like
a
us
brewed
macro
lager
body
is
also
more
substantial
than
the
big
three
us
products
and
does
not
project
a
watered
down
cheap
image
a
note
of
what
i
think
was
fusel
alcohol
became
pronounced
as
the
beer
warmed
up
resulting
in
the
mouthfeel
becoming
harsh
drinkability
is
quite
good
and
beats
the
other
choices
mentioned
above
any
day
pours
a
very
clear
light
gold
color
with
minimal
head
smell
is
sweet
malt
and
grain
maybe
corn
and
alchohol
taste
is
similar
has
a
little
bit
of
that
sour
fruit
flavor
so
common
in
american
macro
lagers
mouthfeel
is
light
watery
but
very
slightly
oily
and
malty
bottom
of
the
glass
tastes
better
than
the
first
few
sips
for
some
reason
beats
most
macro
lagers
but
barely
fairly
easy
drinking
but
only
marginally
enjoyable
12
ounce
can
pours
light
almond
white
head
not
much
retention
just
picked
up
a
hint
of
skunkyness
but
it
is
a
damn
sight
better
than
the
stuff
that
bmc
puts
out
and
is
often
the
only
drinkable
option
in
those
places
that
dont
carry
good

it
seems
that
a
lot
of
people
think
it
is
better
than
the
us
macros
they
are
greatly
mistaken
many
us
macros
have
little
or
almost
no
taste
i
would
take
that

the
aweful
taste
of
this
beer
it
is

at

i
know
why
they
call
these
things
heinies
to
me
at
least
in
the
bottle
its
because
it
tastes
like
your
posterior
area
this
beer
and
i
have
a
long
angry
history
this
is
a
beer
that
fools
people
into
thinking
it
is
good
because
ait
costs
twice
as
much
as
other
beers
and
bit
came
across
the
atlantic
ocean
to
get
here
well
somewhere
along
the
way
it
got
scurvy
and
died
drink
at
your
own
risk
the
bar
that
my
fall
softball
team
goes
to
has
this
on
tap
it
is
the
special
on
the
nights
we
play
flavor
and
smell
are
much
improved
over
the
bottle
i
would
give
it
a
much
higher
rating
if
i
was
reviewing
the
tap
version
heineken
is
a
beer
best
served
from
a
can
though
their
is
still
a
tin
flavour
the
bottle
version
is
usually
skunked
and
awful
poured
a
bland
gold
colour
with
a
12
finger
head
that
disipated
after
a
minute
or
so
with
the
skunk
smell
removed
some
hops
were
detected
though
the
aroma
picks
up
little
malt
the
tongue
does
watery
but
their
is
flavour
still
has
the
grain
husk
mouthfeel
that
reminds
me
of
my
granfathers
farm
average
drinkability
much
better
from
a
can
than
a
bottle
do
the
dutch
hate
us
or
do
they
have
a
wicked
sense
of
humor
and
like
pranks
do
they
sit
over
in
holland
and
laugh
there
asses
off
as
they
pump
this
crap
into
america
and
we
make
it
the
1
selling
import
i
hope
they
just
like
playing
pranks
but
cause
if
they
hate
us
that
bad
i
am
suddenly
afraid
very
afraid
edit
review
after
having
tasted
this
beer
in
a
can
much
better
f
let
me
start
out
by
saying
that
i
have
had
many
bottles
and
cans
of
heiny
in
the
states
as
well
as
in
europe
heiny
on
tap
in
europe
is
a
completely
different
beer
it
s
not
even
remotely
similar
i
had
this
at
the
old
heineken
brewery
which
is
now
a
museum
in
amsterdam
for
7
50
euro
you
get
a
tour
3
33cl
glasses
of
heiny
and
you
get
to
keep
the
glass
remaining
completely
objective
i
was
floored
by
this
beer
brilliantly
clear
light
golden
forming
a
thick
white
head
with
great
retention
and
lacing
aroma
is
clean
and
crisp
with
delicate
floral
hops
soft
water
and
a
distant
sweetness
mouthfeel
is
extremely
soft
with
a
great
wet
finish
carbonation
is
mild
taste
begins
with
lager
yeast
minimal
flavor
hops
giving
way
to
a
pleasant
and
unique
tealike
maltiness
followed
by
mild
husken
character
and
a
soft
wet
wellbalanced
delicate
bitterness
with
darjeelingmuscat
character
this
beer
is
infinitely
superior
to
the
many
heinekens
ive
had
over
the
years
from
bottles
and
cans
why
they
continue
to
bottle
in
green
is
beyond
me
this
is
a
wonderful
brew
easy
to
drink
with
alot
of
character
and
nuances
like
oh
so
many
beers
of
its
kind
it
pours
a
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
golden
colour
but
with
a
rather
small
head
which
easily
fades
unattractively
no
abundant
smell
and
when
noticed
it
becomes
unappealing
the
taste
is
no
better
a
very
bitter
beer
which
suppresses
any
other
flavors
if
any
present
this
is
truly
a
deplorable
beer
not
to
try
ever
again
i
used
to
think
that
this
beer
was
quite
good
but
tonight
when
i
had
it
i
was
not
impressed
with
it
much
a
golden
colored
beer
white
head
that
booted
before
we
had
a
chance
to
get
to
know
each
other
as
for
taste
nothing
much
to
report
here
i
would
say
that
it
is
like
a
good
bud
or
something
like
that
i
think
this
is
a
good
benchmark
to
judge
regular
lagers
by
but
not
something
ill
be
dreaming
about
tonight
pours
a
predictable
light
goldyellow
color
with
a
white
head
that
is
decent
but
too
quickly
gone
very
little
aroma
slight
grain
sense
grain
also
in
the
weak
watery
taste
i
observed
no
skunkiness
but
i
believe
im
less
sensitive
to
that
since
i
regularly
drink
other
greenbottled
beers
my
sense
of
this
beer
is
that
it
is
drinkable
in
warm
weather
settings
and
with
light
food
offerings
gets
undeservedly
slammed
for
being
a
megabrewery
many
megabreweries
worldwide
should
only
get
criticized
for
brewing
a
runofthemill
lager
before
microbrews
existed
and
beer
life
sucked
heineken
was
one
of
the
finer
beers
available
now
its
just
an
average
eurobrew
shiny
gold
in
color
with
a
grassy
average
malt
body
high
in
euro
hops
smooth
yet
sharp
edged
liquid
and
drinkable
nice
white
head
lasts
an
average
amount
of
time
green
bottles
prone
to
light
infiltration
and
skunkiness
pours
out
a
goldenstraw
color
with
a
thick
white
head
not
much
of
an
aroma
and
the
aroma
that
there
is
is
skunky
taste
is
not
smooth
at
all
and
skunky
also
not
an
appealing
brew
this
is
the
only
beer
my
father
drinks
and
has
been
drinking
for
over
30
years
was
first
introduced
to
this
beer
by
him
didnt
like
it
then
dont
like
it
now
there
was
only
one
time
that
this
beer
tasted
good
and
it
was
on
a
trip
to
montreal
only
time
it
tasted
non
skunky
maybe
its
because
i
was
completely
shit
faced
would
drink
this
in
a
pinch
but
wouldnt
necessarily
enjoy
it
this
was
the
firesale
at
the
saucer
last
night
it
is
hard
to
put
too
hard
a
rap
on
this
beer
it
is
just
what
they
advertise
it
to
be
it
came
with
a
nice
head
on
a
clear
golden
liquid
beyond
those
good
words
the
rest
of
its
attributes
were
average
or
less
i
could
not
smell
an
aroma
and
the
taste
was
milder
than
mild
but
again
i
knew
what
i
was
getting
and
was
not
really
disappointed
this
might
make
a
nice
beer
if
you
have
a
friend
you
are
trying
to
lure
away
from
bud
this
could
be
a
first
stop
on
his
way
to
real
beer
im
working
from
notes
here
since
i
had
this
at
a
friends
house
a
few
days
ago
i
dont
really
feel
that
i
need
the
notes
though
since
this
used
to
be
a
staple
of
mine
before
i
discovered
real
beer
typical
yellow
lager
color
with
a
thin
and
short
lived
head
boy
do
i
remember
that
smell
which
i
used
to
think
was
exotic
because
it
contrasted
so
sharply
with
the
smell
of
american
macros
now
i
understand
that
it
is
the
smell
of
a
spoiled
aka
skunked
beer
the
taste
is
just
as
revolting
as
the
smell
the
only
time
i
ever
had
an
unspoiled
heineken
was
on
tap
in
a
bar
in
brussels
and
my
recollection
is
that
without
the
skunk
it
tastes
just
like
every
other
macro
brewed
lager
bland
and
without
distinction
dont
buy
into
the
marketing
campaign
and
dont
buy
this
lousy
beer
ive
definitely
seen
how
my
tastes
have
changed
with
this
beer
when
i
was
younger
i
thought
this
stuff
was
great
shortly
after
joining
ba
ive
seen
the
error
of
my
ways
this
pours
a
peeyellow
with
a
minimal
lace
some
sulphur
and
a
lot
of
skunk
in
the
nose
taste
is
crisp
but
smooth
with
an
underlying
malt
sweetness
other
than
that
just
skunky
with
that
macro
cooked
vegetable
taste
as
far
as
drinkability
it
would
not
be
hard
to
down
quite
a
few
of
these
if
the
skunkiness
wasnt
there
i
usually
only
drink
this
if
there
is
nothing
else
around
it
is
what
it
is
a
good
lager
i
prefer
to
drink
it
more
and
more
of
it
for
that
matter
in
summer
outside
during
the
summer
to
be
more
specific
it
seems
to
have
a
soso
rap
amongst
the
other
b
a
s
here
but
i
do
find
it
quite
drinkable
with
a
bit
more
body
flavor
than
other
comparitivelypriced
eurolagers
although
grolsch
beats
it
with
a
freshertasting
product
i
also
prefer
to
drink
the
keg
cans
so
im
sure
not
to
get
a
skunked

not
offensivecrisp
and
somewhat

than
one
would
hope
for
in
a
beer
that
is
both
somewhat
light
in
texture
and
crisp
in
smell
and
taste
adequately
drinkable
as
demonstrated
by
its
popularity
not
something
im
going
to
buy
but
ill
drink
it
at
a
party
hosted
by
someone
who
doesnt
know
that
better
beers
are
out
there
light
and
golden
color
appears
watery
oh
what
a
surprise
it
is
head
lives
about
as
long
as
a
sea
monkey
and
is
bright
white
flavor
is
watery
and
sort
of
has
a
peppery
trip
to
it
heavily
carbonated
and
weak
tasting
this
is
not
what
anyone
who
knows
anything
about
beer
would
call
good
light
hops
is
the
only
discernable
flavor
drinkability
decent
often
a
good
choice
as
the
lesser
of
evils
what
can
i
say
glad
its
not
just
me
who
thinks
this
has
to
be
one
of
the
most
overhyped
beers
in
the
history
of
beer
making
i
suppose
if
given
a
choice
between
this
and
budweiser
ill
grab
the
heinie
but
overall
this
is
just
way
too
skunky
for
my
tastes
i
have
heard
that
its
actually
better
in
europe
and
that
its
altered
for
american
tastes
before
exported
but
i
dont
know
if
theres
any
truth
to
that
pours
with
little
fanfare
almost
no
head
or
lacing
smell
is
slightly
skunky
the
taste
is
malty
with
very
mild
hoppiness
this
struck
me
as
very
dry
lager
this
beer
is
very
hyped
and
expensive
people
i
know
who
drink
this
do
so
i
think
because
they
think
its
cool
overall
i
didnt
care
for
this
maybe
in
holland
its
better
on
tap
if
youre
have
to
drink
a
heineken
at
least
try
to
find
it
on
tap
or
in
a
bottle
culled
from
a
12
pack
as
it
wont
have
nearly
as
much
of
a
skunky
flavour
as
a
bottle
from
a
six
pack
thats
been
sitting
day
and
night
exposed
to
light
but
rest
assured
that
skunky
flavour
will
still
be
there
to
a
lesser
extent
pours
a
light
yellow
with
a
head
that
almost
immediately
disappears
its
got
the
typical
eurolager
taste
to
it
but
with
as
is
common
knowledge
a
bit
more
skunk
if
given
a
choice
go
with
a
peroni
or
stella
artois
instead
not
impressed
with
this
one
at
all
its
golden
in
color
with
little
or
no
head
really
light
on
taste
except
for
the
faint
taste
of
skunkiness
i
cant
really
say
too
much
about
this
one
it
did
finish
quite
smoothly
so
i
guess
thats
good
the
aftertaste
wasnt
too
bad
either
pours
a
golden
hue
with
a
little
white
head
skunky
aroma
is
par
for
the
course
average
lager
with
the
addition
of
a
little
bit
o
skunk
i
grew
up
drinking
these
so
the
skunkiness
is
part
of
the
beer
an
average
lager
not
worth
having
around
all
the
time
but
not
bad
to
drink
one
every
once
in
a
while
nothing
to
drink
or
enjoy
at
home
however
all
in
all
this
beer
has
the
image
as
many
have
stated
this
is
the
beer
that
people
want
to
be
seen
with
the
beer
that
doesnt
even
have
beer
in
their
commercials
anymore
as
far
as
appearance
goes
it
is
golden
in
color
with
a
white
head
that
does
not
last
very
long
there
was
some
minimal
lace
as
i
sipped
on
this
beer
it
has
been
a
long
time
since
i
have
had
this
beer
and
i
never
recall
ever
liking
the
beer
i
had
always
spent
most
of
my
time
trying
to
figure
out
why
everyone
liked
it
so
much
well
that
is
something
i
cannot
answer
because
when
the
bottle
is
cracked
the
skunk
is
uncaged
i
wonder
if
this
is
the
smell
that
they
are
going
for
or
is
it
from
the
green
bottles
that
is
my
question
suprisingly
i
did
not
want
to
gag
after
my
first
sip
of
this
beer
but
i
realized
that
it
is
not
as
horrible
as
i
had
remembered
it
to
be
there
just
is
not
much
here
a
bitter
after
taste
that
is
pleasant
nor
is
enjoyable
i
rate
this
beer
unoffensive
except
for
the
smell
of
course
rich
gold
color
thick
white
head
grainy
taste
with
medium
bitterness
and
restrained
astringency
this
is
a
decent
beer
far
more
respectable
than
bud
or
coors
because
it
does
have
some
character
be
as
restrained
as
it
is
but
like
most
lagers
this
beer
is
devoid
anything
really
special
it
is
boring
pours
a
very
clear
pale
golden
color
with
a
foamy
white
head
aroma
is
sweet
malts
and
grains
sweet
malts
up
front
with
a
mild
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
light
in
the
mouth
and
quite
refreshing
this
is
a
nice
beer
to
enjoy
outside
on
a
summer
day
this
pours
a
clean
golden
color
and
has
a
moderate
yet
lively
head
the
head
is
white
and
fluffy
and
somewhat
long
lived
the
nose
is
excellent
sharp
hops
the
body
is
somewhat
soft
and
watery
the
flavor
is
sweet
malt
and
medium
hop
bitter
overall
heineken
lager
is
very
satisfying
and
drinkable
beer
one
of
the
most
known
brands
around
but
still
it
doesnt
makes
me
change
my
opinion
about
it
average
refreshing
taste
good
smell
which
reminds
me
of
an
ingrdient
which
i
cant
really
remember
the
name
right
now
and
nice
sparkling
gold
appearance
a
lager
with
a
fine
reputation
yet
i
find
it
thin
bodied
and
somewhat
flat
tasting
very
light
in
colour
and
thin
laced
carbonation
seems
fine
maybe
it
is
because
it
comes
from
a
can
maybe
i
got
a
bad
batch
im
so
disappointed
maybe
my
expectations
were
to
high
golden
beer
with
head
that
all
but
went
away
rather
quickly
soft
grassy
hops
aroma
that
can
only
be
described
as
uniquely
heineken
the
hops
bitterness
is
probably
the
most
distinguishing
characteristic
of
this
beer
im
not
saying
it
is
anything
out
of
the
ordinary
but
one
must
keep
in
mind
that
heineken
is
quite
often
unfortunately
a
novice
individuals
initial
attempt
at
soemthing
other
than
american
macro
for
these
people
this
is
a
very
bitter
beer
other
than
the
hops
there
is
not
too
much
other
taste
here
a
little
sweetness
and
some
salt
are
the
only
things
that
keep
the
taste
buds
distracted
from
the
assault
of
the
big
carbonation
also
it
has
a
thin
but
appropriate
mouthfeel
ill
buy
cases
of
heineken
if
someone
wants
me
to
pick
up
macro
for
a
gathering
but
thats
the
only
time
i
used
to
really
like
this
beer
when
i
was
younger
but
now
it
just
seems
to
be
lacking
in
anything
that
would
make
it
stand
out
not
bad
tasting
so
much
as
no
taste
at
all
but
for
the
import
price
you
can
do
much
better
had
to
retaste
the
original
import
still
too
sweet
for
my
palate
the
hops
are
a
good
addition
but
this
stuff
keeps
me
in
the
mens
room
too
long
tasted
it
in
europe
and
it
was
a
whole
different
beast
would
drink
it
in
europe
but
not
here
this
is
a
great
allaround
brew
it
has
a
clear
golden
straw
color
i
the
smell
has
a
skunkytwang
and
another
undefineable
quality
the
taste
is
balanced
and
guinuine
it
feels
good
in
the
mouth
and
is
very
drinkable
i
could
drink
this
stuff
all
night
pale
yellow
with
rare
tiny
bubbles
joining
a
sketchy
lattice
of
white
on
the
surface
aromas
of
metal
summer
blooms
lemon
and
green
herbs
flavors
are
nice
bright
and
feature
biscuit
citrus
lemon
cream
steel
and
raw
almond
notes
very
light
overall
and
balanced
cleansing
chiffonlike
the
flavors
melt
in
your
mouth
remember
only
hip
cool
people
sip
heine
are
you
hip
and
cool
i
only
reviewed
this
because
it
was
at
a
restaurant
with
poor
poor
selections
poured
a
very
pale
yellow
color
with
a
thin
white
quickly
dissipating
head
smells
and
tastes
like
a
semihopped
up
amstel
light
seemed
to
really
be
light
bodied
for
a
beer
thats
not
supposed
to
be
light
not
really
a
very
good
brew
drinkable
but
thats
about
it
cheers
anyways
if
my
review
seemed
a
little
bitter
although
the
excessive
carbonation
is
a
bit
of
an
irritant
out
of
the
tap
there
was
no
skunk
aroma
outside
of
the
obvious
skunky
aftertaste
little

523if
there
was
a
value
category
for
this
beer
i
have
a
friend
that
likes
this
so
i
drink
it
more
than
i
care
to
it
has
to
be
one
of
the
skunkiest
beers
i
have
ever
had
have
never
been
able
to
get
past
that
and
understand
why
some
people
like
my
friend
love
it
so
reviewing
it
is
hard
because
i
still
do
not
know
if
this
is
just
how
the
beer
is
supposed
to
be
it
poured
a
light
yellow
color
and
formed
no
head
to
speak
of
an
aroma
of
light
hops
flavor
of
hops
and
grain
the
aroma
of
course
was
ruined
by
the
skunk
aroma
i
had
no
choice
but
to
have
this
at
a
pizza
restaurant
as
for
a
massproduced
beer
it
has
some
value
especially
when
nothing
but
bud
is
available
smells
skunky
but
served
ice
cold
its
fairly
crisp
and
drinkable
this
is
a
prime
example
of
what
glitzy
advertising
campaigns
can
do
for
a
beer
in
the
us
its
always
skunky
more
than
two
of
these
leaves
me
with
an
awful
taste
that
cant
be
removed
absent
a
good
brushing
and
some
listerine
other
than
being
a
typical
lagerstyle
beer
it
had
an
unpleasant
note
to
it
that
made
it
a
little
hard
to
drink
not
a
very
good
beer
nothing
too
impressive
light
somewhat
watery
and
quite
often
skunked
you
think
they
would
go
to
a
brown
bottle
to
keep
it
fresh
what
i
find
amusing
is
people
who
think
the
skunked
taste
is
part
of
the
import
mystique
very
average
smells
like
cabbage
very
carbonated
more
bite
in
the
taste
then
its
american
counterparts
miller
and
bud
but
overall
weak
mast
produced
beer
yellow
average
color
with
no
real
impact
overcarbonated
with
a
slight
musty
malt
nose
taste
of
slight
malt
and
is
very
watery
no
hops
detected
at
all
tastes
like
it
is
very
mass
produced
and
rushed
this
stuff
is
like
soda
carbonated
and
watery
it
isnt
absolutely
terrible
i
can
handle
it
with
a
meal
but
when
drinking
is
the
only
thing
going
on
heineken
is
a
bad
choice
it
has
a
bitter
acidic
taste
henie
has
an
awful
awfulness
that
i
have
never
been
able
to
figure
out
at
best
its
a
bad
euro
lager
at
worst
it
is
skunked
why
do
people
drink
this
beer
we
have
catered
parties
two
or
three
times
a
year
if
the
caterer
recommends
henie
as
the
premium
beer
we
will
not
hire
them
standard
light
gold
hue
with
excellent
clarity
thinnish
wispy
head
lacks
the
retention
that
a
good
pilsner
should
have
no
lace
the
aroma
is
of
sweet
vegetal
dms
along
with
a
lightly
skunked
noble
hop
nose
not
particularly
appetizing
aromawise
the
carbonation
is
high
and
approaches
prickly
and
the
body
is
fairly
light
grassy
hop
flavors
dominate
the
flavor
profile
with
soft
hop
bitterness
and
dilute
non
descript
grainess
secondary
the
green
bottle
of
course
allows
skunked
hop
oil
flavors
to
detract
from
enjoyment
even
from
a
shielded
case
the
hops
retain
a
mercaptan
twang
they
must
expose
this
brew
to
sunlight
prior
to
packaging
the
beer
finishes
dry
but
thankfully
clean
and
somwhat
bland
yes
skunked
and
forgettable
even
if
it
wasnt
i
dont
think
this
is
a
particularly
good
pilsner
ill
still
take
it
over
a
macrobrew
since
its
more
flavorful
there
are
so
many
better
pilsners
brewed
here
in
the
us
and
abroad
why
bother
with
this
one
if
not
for
the
green
bottle
i
would
say
it
has
the
potential
to
be
above
average
brisk
and
fresh
has
a
refreshing
zesty
tang
in
the
bite
herbal
skunky
notes
on
the
nose
great
session
brew
on
a
hot
summers
day
the
epitomy
of
skunk
this
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
with
an
often
funky
flavour
green
bottles
at
least
its
drinkable
though
mass
marketing
does
wonders
for
average
beer
i
wont
turn
one
down
if
its
free
and
theres
nothing
better
but
i
would
never
pay
to
drink
this
beer
there
are
just
way
too
many
better
beers
out
there
heineken
is
king
of
skunky
green
bottled
beers
never
had
one
that
wasnt
tolerable
barely
if
theres
nothing
else
to
drink
this
stuff
would
get
a
big
fat
0
on
taste
from
me
the
fact
that
i
wince
when
i
drink
it
tells
me
all
i
need
to
know
always
tastes
alittle
skunky
no
wonder
the
dutch
export
so
much
of
this
they
dont
want
to
drink
it
what
are
you
doing
you
know
a
beer
has
problems
when
bud
can
poke
fun
at
it
way
over
carbonated
gushers
get
a
growler
full
of
this
and
its
easy
to
put
down
while
watching
some
football
and
tailgating
chug
able
this
is
a
live
cultured
beer
very
unique
if
you
get
the
chance
you
have
to
try
as
it
is
not
being
brewed
any
longer
overall
this
is
one
of
the
worst
lagers
i
have
ever
had
its
sour
then
as
you
drink
becomes
more
drinkable
almost
as
bad
as
bmc
yet
crafted
wow
was
the
first
word
out
of
my
mouth
after
tasting
this
incredible
clean
and
smooth
bit
of
sweet
apple
and
dry
cereal
on
the
front
end
with
a
very
dry
finish
bit
of
nuttiness
through
out
balance
is
impeccable
well
blended
with
a
body
thats
on
the
heavy
side
of
light
the
body
really
makes
this
beer
being
well
carbonated
but
well
held
together
as
well
very
good
o
the
yuengling
lager
is
still
one
of
my
favorite
lagers
this
isnt
awful
but
it
is
a
decent
go
to
if
there
is
nothing
else
around
a
middle
of
the
road
lager
12
oz
bottle
from
a
variety
pack
pours
slightly
hazygolden
with
a
medium
lasting
white
head
and
lively
carbonation
aroma
is
of
biscuit
malt
and
grassy
hops
body
is
medium
and
crisp
biscuit
malt
balanced
on
the
palate
by
herbal
grassy
hops
finish
is
medium
lasting
semidry
nice
lager
i
would
definitely
buy
it
again
o
its
a
good
beer
makes
for
a
good
session
beer
i
could
see
enjoying
a
few
of
these
bad
boys
hanging
out
with
my
beer
geek
buddies
while
grilling
meat
its
perfect
with
a
nice
salty
piece
of
food
cheers
o
a
good
enough
beer
as
a
default
it
is
definitely
a
good
example
of
its
style
slightly
hazy
dark
gold
in
color
this
beer
supports
a
nice
frothy
white
head
it
has
a
pleasant
clean
aroma
of
sweet
grain
and
maybe
a
hint
of
hops
it
has
a
fuller
body
than
most
euro
lagers
and
it
tastes
much
how
you
would
expect
from
the
smell
smooth
mellow
and
sweet
but
with
enough
balance
to
keep
it
drinkable
overall
a
tasty
lager
worth
trying
if
you
are
in
the
lager
mood
but
nothing
stands
out
well
done
o
overall
i
believe
this
is
a
really
nice
summertime
beer
or
a
good
in
for
those
new
to
craft
beers
o
river
horse
has
an
exceptional
lager
here
will
enjoying
this
again
for
sure
overall
a
decent
if
unspectacular
pale
lager
the
initial
flavor
is
great
but
the
aftertaste
takes
a
bit
of
the
shine
off
of
this
beer
for
me
o
very
surprising
i
went
into
this
with
low
expectations
but
came
out
pleasantly
surprised
infinitely
drinkable
with
great
smooth
and
well
blended
flavors
overall
a
drinkable
beer
hinted
at
a
touch
of
cider
in
a
piles
or
pale
ale
the
aroma
was
dull
boring
and
bland
this
was
your
classic
macro
lager
light
aroma
of
grain
and
rice
and
that
was
about
it
the
taste
went
nowhere
as
well
while
it
was
crisp
and
refreshing
so
is
water
and
this
was
not
what
i
wanted
at
the
time
very
light
grain
flavor
and
no
depth
at
all
the
finish
was
nonexistent
a
good
tasting
beer
with
lots
off
flavor
well
made
o
the
beer
is
very
drinkable
and
its
quite
flavorful
for
the
style
it
would
make
a
good
accompaniment
to
a
meal
sadly
the
taste
and
aroma
is
on
the
bland
side
but
the
refreshing
feel
of
the
beer
helps
it
out
this
is
certainly
a
session
beer
and
is
what
saves
it
i
think
people
who
are
getting
into
beer
this
is
a
nonoffense
beer
to
try
definitely
better
than
your
macro
lagers
overallinteresting
if
not
entirely
successful
take
on
a
hoppy
lager
ok
but
pales
in
comparison
to
some
others
worth
a
try
o
easy
to
drink
not
a
remarkable
taste
but
not
boring
either
overall
nicely
done
lighter
lager
pleasant
brew
here
not
really
sure
what
to
think
of
this
one
just
seemed
way
too
sweet
for
a
euro
pale
drinkabilitysuper
sessionable
i
like
the
grassy
honey
combo
river
horses
best
so
far
for
the
style
this
beer
is
exceptional
the
taste
is
very
bready
malts
with
a
slight
sweetness
there
was
also
fruityapple
and
pear
hint
in
the
finish
a
bit
of
a
hoppy
biterness
in
the
finish
caps
things
off
pretty
good
definetly
a
clean
crisp
quality
lager
the
beer
is
medium
and
a
lot
fuller
than
i
expected
it
to
be
could
drink
a
bunch
of
these
not
overly
complex
but
an
easy
going
well
made
lager
one
of
the
best
lagers
ive
had
in
a
while
meduim
hop
profile
and
clean
sweet
malt
flavor
great
balance
very
nice
biscut
taste
towards
the
end
finishes
pretty
clean
but
still
sweeter
than
other
euro
lagers
i
was
itching
for
another
sip
again
and
again
went
great
with
my
buffalo
wings
the
drinkabillity
is
exceptional
ill
definately
be
looking
for
offerings
from
this
brewery
in
the
future
drinkability
this
is
an
awesome
beer
i
think
it
is
making
my
list
of
faves
tried
the
river
horse
unfiltered
lager
on
a
whim
i
had
high
hopes
at
first
the
initial
taste
is
full
of
flavormaybe
a
little
subtle
maltbiscuit
flavor
but
as
it
goes
down
it
becomes
very
average
also
too
carbonated
for
my
taste
appearance
and
smell
also
unremarkable
the
end
result
is
not
unlike
a
very
average
domestic
mainstream
beer
d
decent
drinkability
but
not
exactly
a
brew
that
will
wow
you
id
like
to
think
its
probably
better
for
a
beer
to
bore
you
than
for
a
beer
to
make
you
want
to
drain
pour
it
thats
where
this
one
resides
its
just
plain
overall
this
could
be
the
state
beer
of
nj
could
be
the
sabl
of
new
jersey
and
a
shore
fixture
river
horse
lager
pours
a
hazy
light
gold
with
a
thin
and
quickly
disappearing
head
the
aroma
is
sweet
pilsner
malt
with
hints
of
fresh
baking
break
and
herbal
hops
the
flavor
is
sweet
and
malty
without
being
as
cloying
as
i
expected
from
the
aroma
there
are
some
herbal
hops
in
the
flavor
but
the
bitterness
is
light
to
nonexistant
overall
this
is
a
pretty
solid
beer
not
too
much
to
intimidate
a
bmc
drinker
with
enough
flavor
to
please
a
craft
beer
drinker
poured
form
a
cellar
temperature
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
is
a
hazy
dark
star
color
with
small
but
pretty
pure
white
foam
head
there
is
visible
carbonation
rising
in
the
glass
the
beer
is
unfiltered
so
the
haziness
is
expected
there
is
some
earthy
yeast
is
the
nose
as
well
as
a
hint
of
citrusy
hops
there
is
some
acidic
sweetness
in
the
flavor
kind
of
like
lemon
but
not
quite
you
can
also
taste
some
breaddough
flavored
yeast
there
is
sweet
malt
in
the
aftertaste
the
beer
has
a
light
body
and
a
lot
of
carbonation
that
kind
of
distracts
as
you
taste
the
beer
all
of
the
sweetness
makes
for
some
mouth
coating
this
beer
looks
really
promising
until
you
actually
taste
it
dont
get
me
wrong
its
a
fine
beer
there
are
just
a
lot
of
other
pale
lagers
that
i
like
more
dthis
is
one
thats
really
quite
easy
to
drink
i
could
see
having
quite
a
few
of
these
in
a
night
even
more
so
if
the
taste
was
a
little
more
complex
the
worst
beer
of
the
mixed
12
pack
by
this
brewery
but
still
not
too
too
bad
overall
nice
hoppy
aroma
and
slight
bitterness
to
the
taste
but
had
a
bit
of
a
funky
aftertaste
that
didnt
sit
too
well
with
me
ive
definitely
had
better
euro
pales
but
this
one
is
a
decent
shot
at
one
drinkable
but
not
the
best
tasting
thing
youll
try

the

is
definitely
detracting
coupled
with

a

however
the
overall
session
was
an
eyeopener
to
a
very
expressive
well

of
an

the
taste
was
very
pleasant

just
sit
back

would

enough
to

another

unless

forced
it
so
solid
d
overall
a
fairly
nice
mouthfeel
and
taste
combination
nothing
to
get
overly
excited
about
here
as
the
lager
finishes
smooth
but
was
a
little
on
the
bland
side
a
little
bit
more
sweet
malt
backbone
and
this
beer
could
be
much
better
md
its
well
carbonated
with
a
light
mouthfeel
and
lends
itself
very
well
to
superb
drinkability
definitely
a
worthy
summer
beer
d
very
drinkable
but
very
forgettable
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
small
tight
white
head
that
settles
into
a
light
ring
the
aroma
is
of
light
hay
some
green
apple
and
lemon
the
taste
is
sweet
not
cloying
or
anything
close
to
that
but
kind
of
a
sugar
sweetness
some
hay
or
grass
flavor
perhaps
a
touch
of
grain
a
light
body
with
plenty
of
carbonation
quite
fizzy
maybe
too
much
carbonation
starts
and
finishes
sweet
quite
a
unique
lager
imo
not
a
euro
lager
in
any
regards
i
dont
know
much
about
this
brew
but
i
would
say
that
it
has
some
wheat
malt
in
it
the
back
of
the
label
seems
to
suggest
this
a
sweet
lager
though
not
that
sweet
different
but
easily
drinkable
golden
hue
with
tumultuous
body
and
exceptionally
large
white

unpleasant

alcohol

the

lacking
in
notable
characteristics
that
standout
chalk
this
one
up
with
rolling
rock
and
other
macro
light
fizziness
picked
this
up
as
a
freebie
in
a
trade
a
few
months
back
and
well
curiosity
finaly
got
to
me
pours
a
slightly
darker
shade
than
most
bmc
with
no
haed
and
no
lacing
as
expected
smells
of
slight
skunk
hit
me
followed
by
faint
malt
taste
not
bad
not
as
bad
as
it
smells
but
still
not
great
it
is
kind
of
drinkable
could
totally
see
myself
with
this
beer
on
a
nice
warm
summer
night
easy
drinking
not
offensive
heck
i
bet
the
neibors
might
even
drink
this
this
is
a
very
basic
beer
and
on
the
better
side
of
the
style
not
quite
like
budweiser
but
more
like
a
heineken
d
highly
drinkable
and
decent
tasting
fairly
basic
but
that
with
this
style
you
dont
really
want
anything
too
over
the
top
all
in
all
the
rating
on
ba
is
a
little
bit
harsh
in
my
opinion
this
is
one
worth
trying
but
not
a
worldbeater
by
any
means
i
love
this
stuff
lagers
especially
pale
lagers
are
my
favorite
style
they
are
woefully
underrepresented
by
american
craft
brewers
in
my
opinion
much
respect
to
river
horse
for
this
offering
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
light
very
easy
to
drink
d
definitely
a
summer
beer
im
downing
in
the
middle
of
winter
id
be
lying
if
that
didnt
impact
my
thoughts
a
bit
but
overall
a
very
solid
example
of
the
style
in
my
eyes
d
fine
but
not
great
overall
better
than
i
recall
decent
lager
that
wont
offend
a
good
light
beer
poured
a
yellow
clear
color
but
with
a
surprisingly
full
thick
head
looked
fairly
generic
the
smell
was
mostly
malty
with
a
pinch
of
spicy
hops
but
overall
also
kind
of
generic
the
taste
was
similar
to
the
smell
the
beer
was
dominated
by
malts
and
grains
but
ended
with
a
little
bit
of
dry
hoppiness
but
not
really
any
bitterness
however
there
was
a
light
sweet
presence
in
the
aftertaste
that
did
separate
this
beer
from
some
standard
marco
brew
it
was
well
carbonated
with
a
thin
mouthfeel
which
left
me
the
overall
impression
that
this
was
just
a
micro
version
of
an
average
light
session
beer
i
was
a
little
taken
aback
by
the
color
and
smell
of
the
brew
but
the
taste
redeemed
it
from
a
flush
i
wouldnt
pick
up
a
6
and
im
a
little
hesitant
of
what
my
perception
of
the
next
one
of
these
from
the
mix
pack
will
be
but
for
now
its
okay
got
a
variety
pack
so
im
going
to
taste
them
all
though
reading
the
other
reviews
maybe
its
just
that
my
standards
are
low
when
they
come
to
this
style
but
if
this
was
available
in
my
neck
of
the
woods
i
would
certainly
use
it
as
an
introductory
beer
to
the
macro
types
and
go
back
to
it
occasionally
myself
it
looks
freaking
gray
almost
a
very
dull
and
hazy
gold
color
i
smell
some
classic
lager
sulfur
notes
and
a
slightly
sour
grain
note
the
taste
is
pretty
mediocre
craftbrewed
lager
more
hops
than
a
macro
or
eurolager
but
the
malt
taste
and
body
suffers
i
could
totally
drink
this
all
day
if
it
was
free
buy
it
nah
basically
a
decent
inoffensive
lager
the
malts
are
a
little
similar
to
an
export
lager
for
the
sweet
grains
i
also
get
a
yeast
character
that
reminds
me
of
apple
pie
filling
so
while
this
isnt
a
terribly
complex
beer
its
something
a
little
different
for
the
style
and
tasty
thin
and
watery
feel
not
unpleasant
but
not
much
there
its
a
notbad
lager
very
run
of
the
mill
but
drinkable
tmd
malty
sweet
some
sugary
flavours
a
bit
of
light
citrus
mouthfeel
is
a
medium
carbonation
and
a
lighter
body
a
touch
of
bittering
on
the
finish
but
a
little
on
the
light
side
overall
decent
drinker
certainly
easy
enough
but
other
options
are
out
there
mediumbodied
crisp
mouthfeel
along
with
a
good
level
of
drinkability
to
match
not
the
companys
best
brew
but
a
decent
stab
at
the
style
nonetheless
o
overall
a
dry
sweet
lager
that
sits
somewhere
between
a
boston
lager
and
a
yeungling
its
been
years
since
ive
had
this
so
decided
to
update
review
has
a
bit
more
flavor
and
sweetness
then
a
yuengling
but
a
bit
rough
around
the
edges
at
times
and
not
as
smooth
or
polished
as
a
sam
adams
clean
golden
color
with
a
loose
minimal
head
it
does
have
a
moderately
interesting
very
slightly
hoppy
aroma
that
i
enjoyed
however
when
it
comes
to
taste
ummmm
whats
the
opposite
of
bold
mild
i
guess
would
be
generous
description
or
maybe
like
an
englishstyle
bitter
of
sorts
waterlike
and
uninteresting
is
probably
more
accurate
when
poured
into
a
standard
victory
pint
glass
this
river
horse
is
a
clear
sunshine
yellow
that
had
a
miniture
head
of
fizzy
white
bubbles
it
only
took
these
fizzy
white
bubbles
to
fizzle
away
into
a
few
rings
along
the
edge
and
if
youre
lucky
a
spot
or
two
of
lace
it
had
a
solid
burnt
aroma
of
toasted
malts
citrus
fruits
citrus
hops
and
it
finished
up
with
a
little
lemon
zest
it
had
a
crispy
taste
that
contained
toasted
malts
a
small
slice
of
lemon
a
few
more
citrus
fruits
and
then
it
ended
with
some
spicy
and
dry
floral
hops
it
was
clearly
a
light
bodied
beer
with
a
crispy
and
dry
aftertaste
of
floral
hops
and
a
touch
of
toasted
caramel
malts
it
was
really
nothing
more
than
your
run
of
the
mill
clean
fresh
session
lager
d
could
be
sessionable
but
there
are
other
choices
out
there
not
the
best
from
river
horse
the
clear
golden
color
has
a
slightly
orange
tint
topped
with
a
modest
head
the
aroma
is
muted
but
what
is
present
is
pale
malt
with
a
small
hint
of
yeast
the
flavor
mirrors
the
aroma
with
subdued
malt
and
slight
sweetness
not
much
of
a
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
not
bad
this
beer
is
not
very
assertive
but
the
flavors
that
do
come
through
are
not
bad
drinkability
it
wasnt
what
i
would
really
call
a
regular
lager
but
it
was
good
and
i
would
have
to
say
very
refreshing
cant
really
say
all
that
much
about
this
beer
but
this
is
just
completely
run
of
the
mill
no
more
no
less
i
guess
you
can
call
it
drinkable
but
very
watered
down
and
flavorless
right
in
the
eyes
of
a
macro
light
the
drinkability
just
is
not
there
for
me
as
i
dont
like
this
beer
at
all
mk
its
somewhat
drinkable
if
you
are
looking
for
a
nofrills
beer
it
might
be
averageatbest
if
it
were
a
macro
but
as
a
craft
beer
its
a
miss
the
first
impression
of
taste
really
impressed
me
there
was
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
there
was
a
really
nice
refreshingly
slick
feel
there
was
also
some
actual
taste
in
this
irish
lager
im
sorry
to
say
this
but
i
just
had
some
smithwicks
the
other
day
and
i
prefer
this
beeri
know
thats
an
irish
red
ale
i
just
wanted
the
comparison
of
irish
productsstyle
lines
lots
of
zesty
grains
and
malt
flavor
some
nice
balance
this
would
go
really
well
with
a
burger
or
hot
dog
with
spicy
mustard
this
was
essentially
anotehr
underwhelming
brew
from
river
horse
seems
the
special
andor
seasonal
brews
are
the
ones
to
try
and
the
regulars
are
fairly
average
at
best
paid
1
49
for
a
bottle
a
very
lazy
slightly
almondamber
brown
with
a
hint
of
orange
the
most
noticeable
smell
is
like
under
converted
malt
the
taste
is
similar
like
im
drinking
right
out
of
the
mash
tun
low
carbonation
and
mouthfeel
is
quite
wimpy
and
weak
cheers
this
is
not
horrible
for
a
lager
i
could
see
it
on
a
hot
day
in
the
summer
i
see
no
reason
to
drink
more
than
one
of
these
beers
in
a
sitting
this
is
not
a
horrible
beer
and
it
does
not
seem
to
be
overly
beset
with
major
flaws
but
with
so
many
quality
beers
available
today
i
would
not
recommend
this
brew
drinkability
lower
than
good
in
my
book
as
this
is
just
not
an
exciting
beer
on
the
flavor
and
aroma
front
poured
a
hazy
light
amber
color
with
scant
white
head
smell
is
slightly
sweet
but
very
minimal
taste
is
very
sweet
and
citrusy
lemon
and
extremely
pleasant
finish
is
refreshing
but
a
slight
dryness
coming
through
was
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
would
be
a
good
session
beer
for
a
hot
summer
arfternoon
nothing
complex
about
it
just
say
no
this
is
the
second
euro
pale
lager
ive
had
in
two
days
and
they
are
pretty
similar
on
the
sweet
side
but
not
cloying
kind
of
effervescent
with
some
detectable
hop
presence
this
one
is
on
style
if
my
understanding
is
correct
maybe
not
my
cup
of
tea
but
it
is
a
well
made
beer
this
poured
with
a
thin
white
head
that
seemed
to
evaporate
as
quickly
as
i
could
pour
it
turned
out
to
be
a
pale
yellow
color
with
some
floating
yeasties
in
evidence
the
nose
was
sweet
but
not
neccesarily
of
all
malt
i
thought
that
i
may
have
detected
some
corn
in
there
the
mouthfeel
was
thin
and
grainy
with
a
light
sweetness
on
the
palate
the
finish
was
also
mildly
sweet
but
lacking
a
really
good
lager
flavor
this
would
be
good
as
a
summer
beer
with
an
outdoor
barbecue
and
friends
as
a
session
beer
but
im
not
going
to
reach
for
it
as
a
matter
of
habit
pours
a
pale
golden
yellow
w
a
finger
of
bright
white
head
some
small
dark
particles
visible
no
lacing
to
speak
of
very
little
aromajust
a
small
bit
of
grainy
malt
a
small
bit
of
grassy
hops
taste
is
a
husky
pale
malt
with
some
caramel
flavor
coming
through
a
slight
hop
bitterness
at
the
finish
medium
body
with
a
medium
carbonation
level
theres
nothing
really
great
about
this
beer
but
its
a
decent
lager
thats
a
step
above
the
macros
i
pity
people
that
are
trying
to
expand
their
beer
horizons
pick
up
this
then
think
damn
i
couldve
bough
2
cases
of
bud
for
the
price
of
that
12pack
yellow
bad
sign
i
usually
do
not
like
yellow
beer
fizzy
head
went
away
fast
smell
is
full
of
adjuncts
sweet
corn
and
rice
however
i
did
detect
the
slight
presence
of
slight
hops
taste
was
very
much
like
a
macro
but
i
could
find
hints
of
a
slightly
more
impressive
grain
bill
kind
of
a
husk
thing
going
on
as
well
did
not
really
like
that
mouthfeel
was
actually
full
of
flavor
and
very
crisp
kind
of
like
a
good
tasting
macro
this
could
be

nothing

theres
better

therenothing

wouldnt

my
way
to
buy
again
poured
out
a
light
golden
color
with
a
small
head
no
lacing
left
on
the
glass
which
told
me
that
it
wasnt
the
freshest
out
there
smell
consisted
of
some
sweetened
malts
light
whiff
of
corn
and
that
was
pretty
much
it
quite
light
in
the
smell
and
taste
department
taste
was
slightly
on
the
sweet
side
with
a
hint
of
some
pale
wheat
mouthfeel
was
slightly
watered
down
i
thought
it
also
seemed
to
be
a
little
flat
overall
its
not
the
best
lagers
out
there
but
to
wash
down
dinner
i
guess
it
gets
the
job
done
presentation
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
this
is
a
hazy
strawcolored
liquid
with
a
thin
unremarkable
white
head
grain
and
grass
are
first
notable
in
the
aroma
followed
by
a
bit
of
caramel
not
much
hops
in
the
aroma
but
they
do
come
through
in
the
taste
its
a
moderatelydry
brew
with
a
lot
of
graininess
seems
to
have
a
cereal
grain
and
husklike
quality
that
doesnt
really
fit
with
the
flavor
also
it
has
a
thin
meager
body
i
wasnt
particularly
impressed
with
this
brew
but
id
probably
have
it
again
in
a
pinch
the
beer
pours
a
pale
gold
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
quickly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
average
it
has
a
grainy
pale
malt
scent
along
with
a
rice
aroma
it
is
light
on
hops
and
seems
quite
dry
the
taste
is
decent
it
has
a
grainy
pale
malt
flavor
that
is
weak
and
watery
but
at
least
it
tastes
like
beer
unlike
most
macros
it
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
sweet
and
slightly
dry
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
low
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
decent
lager
it
has
pretty
good
flavor
but
the
appearance
and
aroma
need
to
be
tweaked
a
little
all
in
all
its
a
good
drinker
not
too
good
but
i
can
drink
it
easily
i
wouldnt
get
it
again
though
i
taste
alot
of
fruit
almost
like
a
granny
smith
apple
it
leaves
no
lace
around
the
glass
however
it
goes
down
real
smooth
and
tastes
real
good
in
your
mouth
almost
like
you
could
leave
it
there
for
awhile
i
could
see
myself
drinking
this
on
an
everyday
basis
hazy
light
golden

small
off

definitely
corn
and

tones
taste
has
a
little
cooked
corn
quality
to
it
quite
sweet
but
a
little
bit
of
a
dry
finish
nicely
carbonated
and
medium
bodied
to
me
personally
theres
not
a
lot
of
difference
between
this
and
most
mass
marketed
adjunct
lagers
thin
anarchic
cream
haze
top
fizzy
and
active
in
the
glass
of
a
dark
gold
color
goodlooking

is
a
bit
smelly
of
dusty
wheat
the
first
thing
that
i
was
struck
by
besides
the
low
carbonation
of
this
brew
was
a
tart
limey
not
british
taste
that
felt
like
an
offtaste
to
me
otherwise
there
is
a
nice
honeysweet
cream
of
wheat
in
the
aftertaste

quietly
from
a

this
ended
up
being
my
favoritebut

from
the
12ounce
brown
bottle
a
slightly
murky

residual

concealing

in
its
acidity
and
the
hops
apropos
to
the
style
drinkable
but
a
little
light
for
me
zum
wohl
pours
clear
pale
straw
with
a
small
white
head
that
races
to
leave
barely
any
remnants
left
behind
as
lacing
aroma
is
very
slightly
grainy
with
a
little
sweetness
flavor
is
crisp
slightly
sweet
but
mostly
grainy
maltiness
body
is
slightly
thin
finish
is
crisp
clean
and
quite
refreshing
this
beer
is
just
bland
not
in
a
budweiser
way
for
sure
but
the
lable
led
me
to
expect
something
more
where
is
the
flavor
you
will
pick
up
a
very
bland
malt
base
with
basically
nothing
else
going
on
it
is
hard
to
tell
if
the
flavors
would
be
good
if
there
was
more
because
it
is
very
difficult
to
pick
up
on
much
of
anything
this
beer
was
a
major
let
down
going
to
have
to
disagree
with
some
of
the
previous
posts
and
say
this
is
a
decent
session
beer
there
are
times
when
a
beer
like
this
is
just
what
you
need
when
you
just
need
a
beer
fresh
batch
delivered
from
the
brewery
1
week
ago
quite
hazy
but
it
does
not
appear
to
have
been
bottle
conditioned
no
yeast
particulate
can
be
found
in
either
the
bottle
or
the
glass
this
is
some
serious
chillhaze
yellow
golden
in
color
with
a
creamy
white
head
that
drops
quickly
but
keeps
a
good
collar
and
light
surface
coating
the
aroma
is
not
offputting
but
somewhat
odd
no
real
malt
character
is
noticeable
and
there
are
no
hops
to
speak
of
the
body
is
medium
with
a
fine
moderate
carbonation
that
is
somewhat
dull
in
the
mouth
the
flavor
is
of
a
quasidryish
maltiness
supported
by
an
underlying
bitterness
no
hop
flavor
is
discernable
its
well
balanced
but
lacking
in
finesse
as
neither
the
malt
or
the
hops
come
through
its
also
kind
of
soapy
which
may
explain
things
im
guessing
that
this
is
a
bad
batch
due
to
insufficient
rinsing
following
a
caustic
cleaning
leaving
an
abundance
of
fatty
acids
and
an
increase
in
ph
due
to
residual
caustic
residue
ill
have
to
revisit
this
beer
but
it
is
fresh
and
it
was
delivered
to
the
distributor
by
one
of
the
owners
the
packaging
is
in
perfect
condition
so
i
have
to
assume
that
theres
nothing
unusual
about
this
not
an
old
or
returned
case
going
back
out
to
the
public
its
just
a
bad
batch
however
since
i
hate
to
put
this
up
i
will
make
an
extra
effort
to
rereview
it
this
week
its
not
that
bad
drinkable
brew
from
the
neighbors
seems
to
me
like
this
is
a
pretty
bad
kiwi
beer
that
gets
mass
produced
and
focuses
on
export
and
marketing
i
am
not
a
fan
skunkayyyy
for
some
reason
i
have
always
enjoyed
the
pure
skunkaliciousness
of
steinlager
its
a
lager
that
hits
you
in
the
nose
and
mouth
once
you
get
past
the
initial
assault
this
beer
disappears
in
a
hurry
and
leaves
a
barely
noticeable
hop
trace
im
a
sucker
for
beers
in
green
bottles
moosehead
henrys
blue
boar
the
original
rolling
rock
so
its
no
wonder
that
i
fall
for
this
beer
from
time
to
time
i
feel
that
this
beer
would
not
outsell
most
american
lower
level
beers
in
fact
i
cant
even
decide
what
flavors
are
in
this
beer
seriously
i
am
not
a
fan
of
euro
lagers
it
may
be
great
but
it
tastes
like
bad
heineken
overall
excellent
and
well
done
pale
lager
would
like
to
try
it
from
a
can
or
on
tap
to
see
if
the
initial
skunk
is
not
present
very
basic
type
beer
reminds
me
of
a
basic
us
domestic
beer
not
something
i
would
normally
choose
to
be
honest
pretty
smooth
with
little
flavor
a
bit
spicy
and
almost
grassy
type
aftertaste
nothing
special
would
not
miss
it
if
i
never
drank
it
again
nothing
special
about
this
one
just
your
typical
refreshing
and
drinkable
lager
o
not
terrible
its
slightly
above
average
in
the
euro
lager
category
the
hop
taste
and
bitterness
are
a
little
more
aggressive
than
is
the
norm
for
the
style
pass
for
me
nothing
to
see
get
the
steinlager
pure
instead
if
you
can
find
it
its
very
superior
to
this
its
the
bud
of
new
zealand
in
oklahoma
its
here
today
and
gone
tomorrow
really
they
cant
keep
it
on
the
shelves
and
have
a
hard
time
finding
it
to
replenish
it
there
are
a
few
beer
pubs
that
carry
it
and
thats
where
you
have
to
go
to
get
it
because
the
liquor
stores
dont
carry
it
all
the
time
and
did
i
tell
you
thats
its
a
perfect
all
around
beer
overall
just
about
as
average
as
it
comes
for
this
style
you
can
picture
it
in
your
mind
before
you
drink
it
and
then
what
do
you
know
exactly
that
although
i
guess
in
some
ways
thats
not
a
bad
thing
the
verdict
average
a
drinkable
yet
forgettable
lager
pretty
much
like
any
mass
produced
swill
from
the
big
brewers
o
reminds
me
of
a
run
of
the
mill
euro
lager
drinkable
but
there
are
much
better
beers
available
in
nz
as
expected
to
be
honest
a
basic
and
cheap
lager
that
isnt
quite
as
bad
as
some
of
the
mass
produced
ones
ive
tried
over
the
years
its
not
great
but
it
is
by
no
means
the
worst
and
it
was
pretty
easy
to
drink
definitely
not
one
worth
picking
up
but
not
quite
drain
pour
either
thankfully
od
pretty
clean
and
strandard
for
a
macro
lager
lacks
the
corny
grossness
that
alot
carry
with
them
cheap
and
inoffensive
this
beer
seems
to
remind
me
of
a
lesser
quality
budweiser
rjt
o
the
flavors
are
good
at
first
but
then
they
do
not
finish
strong
still
an
average
beer
o
definitely
fits
the
style
refreshing
but
nothing
special
a
little
too
much
bitterness
for
me
even
if
i
did
enjoy
the
creaminess
probably
best
consumed
cold
and
out
of
the
bottle
overall
a
good
representation
of
a
euro
pale
lager
by
nz
breweries
the
intensity
of
the
grainsmalt
flavours
make
this
lager
stand
out
from
similar
brews
in
this
style
nothing
fancy
but
definitely
for
a
hot
summer
day
o
dont
bother
just
more
macro

smell
is

grassy

and
slightly
like
some
cooked

taste
is
of
sweet

some
citrus
zest
on

very
mild
bitterness
on
the

after
each
sip
a
pretty
good
level
of
carboonation
makes
for
a
crisp
and
clean
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
european
style
lager
not
too
shabby
overall
this
needs
to
be
cold
it
can
be
very
enjoyable
what
sets
this
apart
from
others
is
the
dryness
that
keeps
is
crisp
and
refreshing
but
highly
drinkable
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
would
be
interesting
to
compare
to
american
industrial
lagers
whether
any
of
them
are
flirting
with
this
touch
of
hops
or
compare
with
sam
adams
light
this
is
a
good
european
style
pale
lager
its
not
bad
but
not
great
either
this
bottle
was
somewhat
skunky
thanks
to
the
green
bottle
but
i
like
the
bitterness
of
euro
lagers
so
i
was
willing
to
give
it
a
pass
first
beer
from
new
zealand
and
somewhat
unremarkable
id
drink
another
if
someone
gave
it
to
me
but
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
large
bottle
clear
fizzy
yellow
liquid
fairly
heady
aroma
of
euro
hops
tettnangsaaz
light
skunky
profile
tastes
like
a
clean
lager
with
the
hop
presence
medium
bitterness
and
a
bready
sweetness
that
lingers
an
unoffensive
accessible
lager
that
easily
quenches
a
sun
drenched
day
steinlager
is
a
lot
like
as
becks
or
a
stella
to
me
this
beer
is
a
golden
yellow
looking
brew
that
has
a
quick
dissolving
white
head
on
it
the
aroma
of
malts
and
some
hops
are
the
basic
aromas
that
i
get
from
this
beer
the
flavor
of
this
beer
is
grains
and
some
grass
theres
a
little
bit
of
a
hop
kick
in
there
but
not
much
at
all
this
mouthfeel
is
light
and
fairly
crisp
its
a
decent
social
beer
not
much
complexity
or
anything
like
that
from
notes
at
old
chicago
2002
pours
very
pale
yellow
with
a
decent
white
head
and
some
nice
lacing
smells
of
grassy
hops
and
biscuits
flavour
is
similar
but
quite
thin
leaving
very
for
the
otherwise
dry
finish
some
sweet
malts
come
through
in
the
middle
with
notes
of
apple
and
some
subtle
citrus
thin
on
the
palette
not
too
much
going
on
here
on
the
plus
side
for
a
relatively
generic
pale
lager
its
very
refreshing
and
i
can
see
it
making
a
decent
lawncutting
beer
an
average
pale
lager
for
the
price
3
but
i
guess
i
lucked
out
and
dodged
the
skunk
on
this
one
t
attempting
to
ignore
the
skunkiness
this
beer
is
crisp
and
for
a
lager
hoppy
12
oz
into
a
snifter
pale
yellow
with
a
decent
head
right
away
i
notice
that
that
lager
funk
is
missing
tells
me
their
lager
yeast
strain
isnt
that
awesome
it
doesnt
get
the
nose
however
this
is
a
very
clean
brew
with
an
exceptional
mouthfeel
that
goes
down
very
easily
not
a
champion
brew
but
it
sure
is
getting
trashed
by
reviewers
im
pretty
critical
of
bad
beers
but
this
is
certainly
no
adjunct
crap
its
just
not
that
amazing
either
if
its
not
a
bad
price
you
might
want
to
grab
this
one
time
but
if
there
are
some
good
craft
pils
on
the
shelf
for
a
similar
price
i
probably
wont
buy
this
again
this
is
an
ok
example
of
the
style
perhaps
lacking
some
of
the
malt
backbone
to
counter
the
bitterness
overall
this
is
a
typical
euro
lager
taste
is
mediocre
but
easy
to
drink
glad
i
didnt
get
a
skunked
bottle
would
recommend
if
you
want
to
try
a
new
zealand
beer
otherwise
to
expensive
d
easy
to
drink
not
as
bold
as
some
but
balanced
and
clean
drinkability
an
average
beer
in
the
style
pale
lager
overall
totally
shocked
by
this
one
but
in
a
fantastic
way
wahat
a
damn
good
beer
on
a
hot
night
i
could
have
drank
a
half
dozen
of
these
bottle
purchased
from
the
beer
emporium
sandbach
poured
into
glass
slight
head
soon
dissipated
colour
was
pale
straw
smells
strongly
of
malt
taste
was
a
pleasant
surprise
a
good
bodied
well
balnced
taste
with
a
good
caramel
malty
base
alcohol
was
well
hidden
carbonation
was
adequate
without
being
excessive
i
found
myself
quite
enjoying
this
lager
i
cant
say
the
drinkability
is
high
because
between
the
odor
and
the
fact
that
its
nothing
special
i
dont
see
why
you
wouldnt
enjoy
a
different
beer
of
this
style
d
blech
this
may
have
been
a
bad
bottle
but
from
reading
some
of
the
other
reviews
it
seems
like
its
just
bad
overall
overall
above
average
euro
pale
lager
which
isnt
saying
that
much
but
it
isnt
bad
for
the
style
nothing
to
seek
out
but
in
a
pinch
it
works
surprised
its
not
more
popular
a
solid
macro
steinlager
is
continuously
in
the
most
underrated
beer
category
in
the
world
sure
it
is
a
common
easy
to
find
beer
brewed
in
a
large
brewery
but
that
doesnt
make
it
a
budweiser
or
mgd
there
are
large
breweries
that
make
outstanding
mainstream
beers
i
e
heineken
hollandie
stella
artois
peroni
etc
this
is
not
a
unique
beer
just
a
good
ol
fashioned
good
lager
beer
if
you
like
heineken
and
beers
like
that
you
will
fall
in
love
with
steinlager
drinkability
sure
very
drinkable
but
totally
unremarkable
not
bad
but
the
fact
that
it
begins
literally
almost
flavorless
moreso
than
any
light
beer
or
bmc
stuff
ive
had
is
a
huge
turn
off
drinkability
could
finish
it
but
it
frankly
wasnt
that
pleasant
i
poured
into
a
pint
glass
to
a
couple
inches
of
white
head
it
is
pale
yellow
in
color
the
aroma
was
an
immediate
turn
off
i
get
a
skunked
grassy
smell
it
comes
in
a
green
bottle
so
the
smell
was
expected
the
taste
is
metal
sweet
malt
and
finishes
a
nasty
bitter
this
is
not
a
beer
to
be
revisited
unless
it
is
on
tap
i
need
to
quite
trying
these
imported
green
bottled
beer
i
dont
think
ive
had
a
good
one
yet
on
tap
is
a
different
story
since
kegs
shouldnt
get
light
damage
of
course
then
theres
temperature
sweet
grains
remind
me
of
corn
syrup
but
the
beer
tastes
like
it
might
be
all
barley
not
much
hops
in
here
but
does
have
a
slight
drying
effect
on
the
finish
fruitiness
in
a
lager
is
a
bit
of
a
turnoff
malts
provide
a
fullish
body
but
doesnt
really
do
much
for
the
beer
i
am
not
digging
this
much
and
am
working
hard
to
finish
the
25
4
ounces
i
seem
to
remember
this
tasting
much
better
while
in
hawaii
10
years
ago
go
figure
it
is
drinkable
but
thats
about
all
its
not
the
worst
beer
i
have
had
but
its
close
good
effervescence
medium
bodied
overall
just
ok
at
best
not
worth
spending
any
of
your
money
on
just
a
quick
review
for
this
one
basically
an
average
beer
for
its
style
light
gold
color
fluffy
white
head
with
good
retention
grainy
grassy
aroma
and
flavor
very
carbonated
and
light
body
easy
and
smooth
drinkability
at
2
50
for
a
25oz
bottle
this
would
be
a
good
grab
for
a
quick
easy
beer
to
go
with
a
sandwich
for
lunch
and
still
be
able
to
function
the
rest
of
the
day
not
a
bad
beer
worth
a
shot
overall
it
is
nothing
really
special
it
is
defintely
different
for
sure
i
wouldnt
mind
giving
this
one
another
try
because
i
havent
had
it
since
that
time
in
the
dorm
and
that
was
two
years
ago
and
my
pallete
has
matured
over
that
course
of
time
the
problem
is
i
can
never
seem
to
find
it
around
here
it
seemed
like
a
one
time
thing
it
is
not
worth
seeking
out
but
if
you
ever
come
across
it
for
a
decent
price
it
is
atleast
worthy
of
a
try
as
far
as
pale
lagers
go
it
isnt
the
worst
i
have
had
i
actually
would
like
to
take
a
stroll
back
in
time
to
my
crazy
college
days
with
this
beer
sometime
soon
my
old
roomie
is
visiting
chicago
sometime
within
a
month
or
two
i
should
pick
him
up
a
six
pack
as
a
joke
if
i
can
find
it
that
is
d
very
well
off
thirst
this
was
a
very
clear
lager
i
really
wanted
to
like
it
but
its
pretty
mediocre
not
bad
just
average
it
poured
a
very
clear
yellowgold
with
a
very
large
head
the
head
never
quite
desipates
and
it
sticks
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
all
the
way
down
the
smell
is
really
malty
with
almost
nothing
else
the
flavor
is
also
malt
it
has
a
slight
metallic
flavor
i
was
a
bit
disappointed
in
the
flavor
im
just
not
fond
of
that
metallic
taste
carbonation
is
about
right
i
suppose
it
would
make
an
okay
session
beer
though
i
wouldnt
have
more
than
one
and
i
wont
be
in
a
hurry
to
get
more
its
okay
just
nothing
special
overall
it
is
unique
to
the
category
but
nothing
very
special
it
was
only
12
for
a
12
pack
so
i
guess
it
is
a
pretty
good
deal
for
a
cheap
alternative
if
you
are
in
a
pinch
drinkability
very
drinkable
and
decent
for
the
pricea
well
made
n
z
lager
d
this
isnt
the
worst
beer
ive
had
it
does
have
some
flavor
which
is
good
for
a
pale
lager
its
just
nothing
special
with
that
said
though
its
a
decent
refresher
for
a
hot
day
and
i
wont
refuse
to
drink
it
in
the
future
i
probably
just
wont
go
out
of
my
way
to
have
another
one
dont
go
looking
for
this
one
but
dont
turn
it
down
if
passed
too
you
drinkability
its
a
light
enough
beer
that
it
would
work
as
a
session
drink
if
only
the
taste
were
a
little
better
it
is
a
lager
like
a
great
many
other
see
my
review
for
tiger
lager
a
fine
beer
if
you
are
sitting
in
the
first
pub
that
you
find
outside
of
the
auckland
international
airport
nothing
really
special
nothing
really
bad
i
agree
with
yaegerjes
comment
might
as
well
go
with
a
domestic
lager
and
save
the
cash
d
no
shock
and
awe
might
as
well
go
with
a
domestic
lager
and
save
the
cash
for
a
beer
that
was
developed
to
counter
heineken
in
nz
theyve
done
a
pretty
good
job
its
not
quite
as
good
as
heinie
but
its
pretty
darned
close
d
yet
another
midpack
epl
it
goes
down
easily
enough
but
is
devoid
of
much
real
character
things
would
be
much
better
if
the
vegetable
flavors
were
eliminated
poured
from
a
green
bottle
into
a
weizen
glass
has
a
gold
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
skunky
and
slightly
sweet
taste
is
crisp
and
refreshing
finishing
a
little
sweet
watery
and
a
little
bitter
in
the
mouth
highly
drinkable
especially
in
the
heat
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
overall
not
the
best
beer
not
awful
though
today
is
over
100
degrees
and
this
beer
hits
the
spot
a
pretty
straightforward
offering
for
the
style
nothing
noteworthy
a
tad
offseeming
yet
i
cant
possibly
put
my
finger
on
what
could
be
causing
that
not
really
worthy
of
seeking
out
beyond
the
country
tick
maybe
this
one
has
more
than
enough
carbonation
to
clear
your
palate
but
it
actually
makes
this
a
bit
filling
i
had
a
single
from
the
fridge
and
dont
care
who
had
to
drink
the
rest
wont
be
going
back
to
this
again
bit
of
an
unexpected
assault
on
the
tongue
as
compared
to
the
nose
sweet
grains
and
a
bit
of
a
drying
hop
bitterness
gives
the
beer
a
thick
and
almost
oily
body
on
the
swallow
segueing
to
a
more
coarse
finish
light
citrus
flavor
from
the
hops
throughout
bit
drying
in
the
end
however
decent
and
likely
a
flavor
that
one
could
acquire
a
taste
for
d
not
bad
ive
never
had
kiwi
beer
and
i
think
its
better
than
any
ausie
beer
ive
had
yet
its
drinkable
but
nothing
the
slightest
bit
remarkable
fizzy
tingly
carbonation
its
not
awful
its
just
blah
and
at
this
low
of
an
abv
perhaps
it
makes
a
good
drinker
for
a
camping
trip
or
something
not
going
to
recommend
this
one
to
anyone
but
not
going
to
tell
someone
not
to
get
it
its
a
good
beer
for
its
pricre
and
its
pretty
true
to
style
aside
from
the
skunking
taint
drinkability
well
that
was
surprisingly
sufficient
nicely
balanced
and
easily
drinkable
d
not
the
same
as
in
the
green
bottles
in
the
states
very
manageable
for
a
lager
its
rather
run
of
the
mill
beers
is
light
golden
color
with
mild
carbonation
and
little
head
smell
is
subtle
and
mainly
malts
with
a
little
grain
taste
is
similar
bready
malty
grains
a
little
bit
of
bitterness
in
the
finish
i
didnt
expect
much
from
this
beer
and
it
delivered
about
what
i
expected
something
you
could
session
play
beer
pong
with
not
sure
its
good
for
much
else
i
would
put
it
a
small
step
above
your
typical
american
macro
beers
d
i
could
drink
a
fair
amount
of
this
but
i
dont
know
if
i
would
its
slightly
flavorful
but
really
a
disappointment
such
a
disappointment
i
didnt
even
finish
it
pours
a
pale
yellow
with
thin
white
head
that
leaves
quickly
really
not
much
to
look
at
really
dead
smell
can
sense
some
corn
with
real
mild
hop
earthly
flavor
with
some
bready
undertones
some
sweetness
i
have
hard
describing
mouthfeel
is
and
drinkability
are
the
highlights
of
this
beer
as
they
are
slightly
above
average
d
ok
lager
but
nothing
really
special
watch
out
for
skunked
ones
thankfully
mine
wasnt
d
not
great
its
not
overly
offensive
but
i
sure
dont
see
the
point
of
picking
this
beer
over
any
other
popular
import
very
drownable
but
rather
boring
pretty
wellbalanced
though
and
not
a
poor
lager
but
certainly
nothing
special
if
this
is
as
the
label
suggests
new
zealands
finest
beer
then
i
would
really
hate
to
try
their
worst
d
this
beer
is
just
not
good
one
of
my
favorite
beers
for
the
price
one
of
my
most
widely
consumed
beers
in
college
has
a
very
light
apperance
with
a
very
hoppy
aroma
it
has
a
very
refreshing
herbal
taste
i
think
the
mouth
feel
is
about
average
new
zealand
knows
whats
up
d
as
macrobrewed
beers
go
this
is
an
easy
to
drink
example
of
course
this
doesnt
make
it
a
quality
beer
dit
goes
down
very
easily
but
certainly
not
the
best
pale
lager
out
there
i
could
have
a
couple
of
these
pale
straw
color
with
a
cloudy
bottom
and
little
head
or
lace
fresh
slightly
malty
odor
kind
of
blah
this
doesnt
taste
very
good
its
kind
of
watery
with
little
to
distinguish
it
in
either
hop
nor
malt
it
does
feature
that
saver
of
macro
brews
a
crisp
clean
finish
that
provides
a
modicum
of
refreshment
not
worth
going
to
new
zealand
for
but
drinkable
in
a
pinch
this
beer
is
a
clear
pale
golden
color
with
a
medium
thick
and
foamy
white
head
that
diminishes
slowly
spotty
lacing
on
the
glass
lightly
skunky
aroma
with
mild
hops
and
grass
light
clean
body
with
light
hops
and
malt
corn
and
hay
flavors
the
finish
is
clean
and
short
with
a
mild
hops
flavor
and
aftertaste
pretty
boring
overall
d
not
bad
on
a
hot
day
but
would
look
towards
europe
for
better
examples
of
style
when
is
comes
to
pale
lagers
i
like
this
one
clear
yellow
with
a
bubbly
white
head
bready
veggie
and
slightly
metallic
aroma
sharp
bite
that
quickly
goes
sweet
dry
finish
enjoyable
and
refreshing
and
truly
like
no
other
pale
lager
ive
had
overall
it
is
a
good
beer
to
drink
with
pizza
it
has
a
clean
and
crisp
finish
out
of
a
big
ol
bottle
this
beer
was
a
pale
golden
color
with
lots
of
visible
rising
carbonation
the
twofinger
head
was
bright
white
and
both
rose
and
fell
quickly
leaving
some
patches
of
thin
lacing
the
aroma
was
musty
slightly
skunky
and
very
macrolagerlike
with
only
a
slight
pleasantness
from
the
pale
malt
the
flavors
were
similar
but
better
the
pale
malt
being
first
this
time
but
after
that
skunky
character
came
through
and
led
to
a
rather
dry
and
bitter
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
ok
the
carbonation
appropriately
lively
and
the
body
mediumlight
i
used
to
dink
this
all
the
time
when
i
was
in
nz
and
retrospectively
i
dont
know
why
conclusions
this
selection
is
very
forgettable
overall
this
is
a
beer
i
would
never
kick
out
of
bed
i
enjoyed
it
although
it
was
not
a
beer
i
thought
of
as
a
memorable
beer
it
happens
to
be
one
of
the
beers
that
could
go
great
with
some
italian
food
or
some
good
old
sports
food
lil
smokies
or
southwest
eggrolls
pretty
good
but
not
a
stand
out
beer
like
peroni
as
in
when
you
see
the
beer
you
cannot
really
remember
how
it
tastes
but
you
know
it
was
good
given
to
me
by
a
friend
drank
straight
out
of
the
bottle
didnt
expect
enough
to
pour
it
into
a
pint
glass
mediocre
is
the
best
way
to
describe
it
yellow
and
fizzy
high
drinkability
and
clean
finish
would
easily
confuse
it
with
an
american
macro
light
beer
or
german
macro
not
sure
the
price
tag
on
this
baby
but
if
its
comparable
to
the
above
mentioned
types
id
pick
a
case
of
this
up
instead
poured
into
a
pint
glass
yellowish
gold
with
a
frothy
white
head
that
recedes
quickly
and
leaves
little
lacing
aromas
of
fusel
alcohol
and
grain
sort
of
pils
malty
base
with
a
miniscule
dash
of
noble
hops
dry
watercracker
finish
lots
of
carbonation
theres
even
a
little
bitterness
at
the
back
of
the
palate
although
that
may
be
a
metallic
note
rather
than
a
hop
note
not
overtly
adjunctladen
which
is
nice
not
awful
d
ok
besides
the
skunk
its
not
too
bad
d
not
terrible
but
for
the
price
i
will
not
be
seeking
out
again
nothing
to
tempt
me
back
poured
a
clear
golden
yellow
with
a
small
white
head
little
but
of
carbonation
nose
was
kind
of
skunked
and
grainey
taste
was
grainy
a
small
dash
of
hops
and
sordove
grassy
mouthfeel
was
rather
thin
weak
and
somewhat
refreshing
not
my
favorite
but
average
lots
of
carbonation
pours
ok
pale
straw
color
looks
like
a
pale
lager
should
theres
an
off
smell
to
it
sort
of
skunky
perhaps
a
touch
of
wheat
to
it
very
very
lightly
hopped
taste
is
bland
and
unremarkable
its
not
crisp
not
malty
not
fruity
not
much
of
anything
really
its
easy
to
drink
though
exactly
because
theres
really
nothing
there
its
the
bud
light
of
nz
d
drinks
easily
enough
not
a
great
tasting
beverage
however
that
kinda
kills
its
drinkability
purchased
for
a
60
year
old
republican
old
fart
political
fundraiser
held
at
my
parents
house
chosen
bc
it
reminded
me
of
my
nz
trip
4
years
ago
pours
a
clear
pale
yellow
with
minimal
white
head
that
reduces
quite
quickly
skunky
smell
and
skunky
green
light
penetrable
bottle
taste
some
grassy
notes
and
a
bit
of
a
pilsnery
not
although
quite
minimal
pretty
much
your
average
macro
slammage
lager
ok
to
have
around
for
guests
or
for
when
your
palate
is
totally
thrashed
better
than
a
bud
but
no
urquell
steinlager
pours
a
pale
yellow
with
a
white
head
from
a
green
twelve
ounce
bottle
the
aroma
is
very
skunky
the
flavor
is
also
very
skunky
makes
me
wonder
whether
its
supposed
to
taste
like
this
or
if
it
would
taste
better
out
of
a
light
tight
container
avoid
this
looked
like
an
interesting
beer
because
i
have
never
had
a
beer
from
new
zealand
had
a
nice
golden
color
with
a
light
head
the
smell
was
very
skunky
like
you
left
a
heinekin
in
your
trunk
for
about
2
weeks
the
taste
was
thankfully
better
then
it
smelled
but
thats
not
saying
much
for
the
price
id
say
pass
not
bad
this
comes
out
of
the
tap
a
cloudy
straw
yellow
with
a
frothy
white
head
aroma
is
malty
not
too
strong
has
a
hint
of
banana
flavor
is
malty
nice
and
crisp
more
mouthfilling
than
most
lagers
texture
is
sassy
and
jazzy
so
it
makes
you
take
notice
while
it
is
headed
down
the
pipes
pours
fizzy
yellow
with
a
pretty
decent
head
relatively
clean
not
lots
of
adjuncts
some
piney
spicy
hop
aroma
albeit
somewhat
light
taste
is
similar
ive
had
worse
and
ive
had
better
okay
for
a
backyard
quencher
after
yard
work
but
not
much
else
also
i
hate
the
green
bottle
but
at
least
this
batch
tastes
fresh
d
not
a
fan
of
the
euro
pales
lagers
in
the
first
place
but
not
bad
refeshing
i
picked
this
beer
up
because
ive
never
had
a
new
zealand
brew
had
it
well
chilled
in
my
favorite
pilsner
glass
poured
a
bright
yellow
color
with
a
big
white
head
smell
was
sweet
like
sweet
corn
taste
was
thin
and
bubbly
dominated
by
cereal
grains
and
slight
sweet
corn
not
much
flavor
and
pretty
clean
on
the
palate
the
taste
of
the
corn
husk
flavour
is
pretty
strong
and
the
hops
inject
some
bitterness
but
dont
add
any
real
flavour
light
bodied
and
pretty
well
carbonated
its
not
a
bad
tasting
brew
at
all
it
goes
down
easy
enough
and
theres
not
much
of
an
aftertaste
so
its
okay
for
occasional
consumption
d
didnt
enjoy
this
one
enough
to
really
want
a
second
one
i
suppose
if
it
was
put
in
front
of
me
i
wouldnt
refuse
it
poured
into
a
pilsner
got
a
thick
fluffy
white
head
with
an
aggressive
pour
that
disappears
in
about
a
minute
or
two
into
a
thin
white
layer
of
bubbles
it
looks
like
a
really
good
drinking
beer
the
body
is
crystal
clear
with
a
bright
yellow
hue
and
has
some
mild
carbonation
topped
off
with
a
good
head
it
smells
crisp
and
malty
and
thats
all
its
got
a
very
light
body
its
mildly
crisp
when
it
first
hits
your
tongue
slightly
sweet
throughout
and
has
a
bit
of
a
bittery
aftertaste
this
is
a
really
refreshing
beer
on
hot
days
or
nights
not
bad
overall
but
not
good
either
decided
to
finally
buy
a
12er
i
seen
at
a
local
market
on
sale
so
i
figured
what
the
hay
all
i
have
to
say
is
i
drank
alot
of
beer
over
the
years
and
this
stands
as
one
of
the
worst
i
had
ever
tried
ok
looking
but
tasted
very
grassy
if
that
makes
sense
maybe
i
gotta
bad
batch
damn
green
bottles
but
wouldnt
bother
trying
a
2nd
time
thank
heaven
it
was
on
sale
i
tried
this
beer
on
fenruary
26
2008
at
smokeless
joes
in
toronto
ontario
the
been
poured
a
translucent
gold
with
a
thin
white
head
that
didnt
last
long
the
aroma
was
very
grainygrassy
with
some
malty
hints
the
mouthfeel
was
clean
crisp
medium
bodied
and
medium
to
high
carbonation
the
flavour
was
overwhelmingly
grainy
with
some
hoppy
hints
at
the
finish
not
a
great
tasting
lager
but
it
goes
down
very
well
d
one
and
done
no
more
of
these
for
me
worth
a
couple
sips
but
not
a
full
beer
the
taste
is
also
a
stronger
fuller
pale
lager
but
still
pretty
basic
it
has
grain
with
a
definite
grassy
piney
hop
quality
with
definite
light
bitterness
and
hoppy
aftertaste
just
dominating
the
light
sweetness
its
crisp
and
drinkable
with
some
character
d
it
went
down
ok
but
it
wasnt
very
good
considering
the
green
bottle
im
just
happy
it
wasnt
skunked
very
pale
almost
clear
in
color
with
a
huge
amount
of
carbonation
rising
to
the
top
big
twofingered
fluffy
white
head
on
top
with
very
good
stick
european
pilsner
malts
and
very
delicate
noble
hop
in
the
nose
taste
is
quite
a
letdown
after
the
pleasant
aroma
starts
out
with
a
grainy
sharpness
that
quickly
disappears
and
leavs
a
bland
watery
taste
in
the
mouth
finish
is
kind
of
astringent
with
a
catty
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
very
light
and
prickly
i
would
say
that
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
is
good
until
the
unpleasant
aftertaste
the
smell
of
this
beer
lead
me
to
believe
that
it
was
somewhat
fresh
but
the
taste
was
a
letdown
probably
past
its
prime
d
overall
reminds
me
of
a
henieken
or
a
fosters
pass
poured
from
king
kahuna
extra
big
bottle
into
a
lager
glass
aroma
is
different
from
the
good
beer
i
have
been
drinking
recently
smells
of
grass
both
the
type
growing
in
your
yard
as
well
as
the
illegal
drug
there
is
also
light
citrus
heavy
skunk
and
light
malt
pour
typical
golden
straw
color
of
mass
produced
pale
lagers
frothy
white
head
and
it
appears
to
be
very
over
carbonated
over
carbonation
confirmed
on
taste
watery
to
bitter
flavor
tastes
cheap
this
beer
is
bad
although
not
horrendously
bad
like
vb
which
you
often
find
in
the
same
bars
this
one
is
your
standard
straw
macrolager
color
lots
of
fiz
but
no
real
head
nose
is
slightly
skunky
malt
and
some
random
junk
in
there
rice
corn
taste
is
likewise
a
little
stronger
on
that
frustrating
corona
skunkiness
not
a
good
flavor
and
just
biting
enough
that
you
wouldnt
really
want
to
toss
back
50
of
them
feel
is
thin
overall
bad
i
would
not
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
skunky
cardboard
flavors
dry
and
astringent
in
the
back
of
the
throat
after
a
couple
sips
all
i
want
is
water
to
wash
the
taste
out
light
vegetal
flavors
add
nothing
redeeming
and
ultimately
its
wretched
to
drink
gassy
carbonation
unpleasant
aftertaste
and
very
drying
definitely
avoid
the
green
bottles
overall
i
bought
this
in
a
make
your
own
6er
and
i
dont
think
that
i
will
pick
up
another
d
i
probably
drank
this
in
5
minutes
mainly
just
to
get
rid
of
it
overall
it
is
drinkable
but
unexciting
will
still
drink
it
if
it
is
given
to
me
but
wont
search
for
it
or
pay
for
it
drinks
good
nice
for
a
change
better
than
macro
lagers
deasy
to
drink
and
cheap
you
tell
me
what
this
is
meant
for
pours
with
a
light
golden
color
minimal
head
and
lacing
smell
is
mildly
hoppy
taste
is
minimalbut
with
a
cooked
veggie
overtone
dmso
perhaps
but
nothing
much
else
overall
a
good
average
beer
to
drink
with
pretty
much
anything
this
is
a
beer
i
could
drink
in
quantity
as
it
pretty
much
improves
with
the
number
of
drinks
not
necessarily
a
good
thing
but
it
was
on
sale
pours
a
very
pale
color
with
a
thin
onefinger
head
smells
skunky
with
a
touch
of
cooked
corn
in
the
nose
taste
is
somewhat
malty
and
bitter
unimpressive
by
quite
a
bit
certainly
nothing
that
stands
out
another
typical
euro
pale
lager
it
goes
down
ok
but
i
would
think
that
a
beer
should
have
more
going
for
it
than
just
that
drinkability
refreshing
and
clean
tasting
brew
purchased
at
a
store
that
sells
a
lot
of
beer
and
it
was
refrigerated
it
was
about
two
weeks
before
i
got
around
to
drinking
this
beer
in
part
because
it
came
in
a
750
ml
bottle
poured
into
a
clear
12
oz
tumbler
about
2
of
head
that
slowly
receeded
as
i
drank
smelled
slightly
skunky
in
the
bottle
nice
grassy
herbal
notes
in
the
glass
lots
of
lacing
as
the
level
went
down
a
crisp
well
balanced
flavor
with
a
slight
bitterness
to
the
hops
overall
not
bad
for
macrotype
beer
i
enjoyed
all
25
4
ounces
light
yellow
white
head
which
fades
quickly
this
is
a
fairly
uninteresting
skunked
lager
from
new
zealand
there
some
grains
grass
a
bit
of
earthiness
yada
yada
and
its
slightly
bitter
on
the
finish
nothing
else
to
say
really
moving
on
next
could
drink
a
fair
amount
of
these
if
you
could
handle
the
taste
drinkability
i
would
not
recomend
this
beer
comment
never
again
unless
its
free
and
i
have
few
other
options
i
decided
to
by
this
beer
because
i
never
seen
it
before
and
it
came
in
a
750ml
bottle
when
i
poured
it
into
my
glass
it
looked
very
good
golden
yellow
with
an
inch
or
so
head
the
smell
of
it
is
quite
strong
and
not
so
good
when
you
first
get
into
it
but
it
goes
away
a
little
bit
the
taste
is
ho
hum
its
better
than
a
can
of
coors
or
something
but
not
much
more
than
fancy
lawnmower
beer
each
sip
is
smooth
with
a
bit
of
carbonation
i
would
say
that
this
is
just
an
average
beer
and
ill
try
some
other
beers
before
i
buy
this
one
again
this
is
a
very
easy
to
drink
lager
which
is
perfect
for
a
hot
day
pours
an
extremely
clear
bright
gold
almost
shiny
yellow
with
lots
of
foamy
white
head
looks
almost
like
champagne
except
with
lots
of
head
retention
sweet
smell
at
first
followed
by
a
bland
alcoholic
quality
taste
was
okay
for
a
pale
lager
in
my
opinion
was
quite
refreshing
would
certainly
reach
for
this
over
a
heine
or
bud
but
other
than
that
not
much
to
write
home
about
would
make
a
great
lawnmower
beer
crisp
and
refreshing
750
ml
bottle
i
like
that
12
oz
bottle
in
a
boags
footed
pilsner
inch
and
a
half
frothy
foam
that
slowly
dissipates
active
champagnelike
effervescence
a
little
yellowish
in
the
gold
aroma
is
evident
from
a
few
feet
away
and
outdoors
familiar
metallic
tin
with
banana
notes
a
bit
of
earth
detected
as
well
slick
oily
consistency
flat
metallic
aftertaste
reminiscent
of
miller
lite
holy
beer
pong
balls
batman
the
start
reaks
of
silo
cup
and
the
end
feels
like
im
rollling
them
back
across
the
table
i
intended
to
have
this
as
a
tailgate
apertif
for
the
yanksos
game
todaygood
thing
i
celebrated
the
os
win
with
this
a
few
days
later
this
one
shouldnt
hit
high
in
the
order
pours
a
pale
straw
color
with
a
very
nice
and
fluffy
white
head
the
brew
was
poured
aggressively
but
the
sheet
of
chunky
lacing
is
impressive
none
the
less
the
smell
is
almost
nonexistant
for
better
or
worse
some
light
grains
the
brew
has
a
bit
more
of
a
malty
presence
than
a
budweiser
it
has
that
almost
tin
like
hop
character
not
grassy
or
citrus
but
a
bitter
edge
it
doesnt
really
have
that
skunky
euro
lager
taste
the
feel
is
light
and
watery
and
moderately
carbonated
overall
pretty
neutral
an
average
beer
at
best
beats
a
macro
anyday
pours
very
light
more
yellow
than
gold
with
a
big
immaculate
white
head
that
disappears
quickly
very
little
aroma
only
some
faint
herbal
hops
and
an
adjunctsandmalt
base
on
the
palate
bland
is
the
word
things
open
with
fairly
brisk
carbonation
and
bitterness
thats
substantial
for
the
style
but
theres
little
hop
or
malt
flavor
just
another
bland
euro
lager
nothing
special
d
this
is
a
farily
predictable
euro
pale
lager
bad
smell
and
a
sweet
corn
taste
appearance
is
a
light
straw
color
with
a
thick
crisp
head
that
lasts
awhile
aroma
has
a
slight
skunk
maybe
a
bit
of
cracker
taste
has
some
breadinesssweet
with
a
slight
metallic
note
euro
hop
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
that
dances
on
the
tongue
having
a
light
mouthfeel
a
typical
macro
type
lager
having
nothing
too
special
but
a
good
refresher
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
beer
is
a
slightly
hazy
yellowgold
color
with
a
glistening
white
head
the
smell
is
similar
to
most
euro
pale
lagers
slightly
grainy
with
a
touch
of
fruitiness
and
a
definite
skunkyness
about
it
the
taste
is
also
skunky
and
slightly
bready
but
it
has
a
distinct
hop
bitterness
about
it
that
isnt
very
flattering
the
beer
is
light
in
body
and
finishes
smooth
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
if
someone
offered
them
up
but
i
dont
think
ill
be
perusing
any
steinlager
anytime
soon
d
not
hard
to
drink
i
got
through
the
bottle
pretty
easily
but
not
something
i
would
seek
out
again
d
not
tasty
at
all
and
doesnt
go
down
well
at
least
it
isnt
filling
i
had
this
beer
at
a
tasting
and
hated
it
but
i
decided
to
give
it
a
fair
chance
by
trying
a
full
bottle
since
ive
had
beers
that
have
tasted
very
different
when
drinking
a
full
bottle
instead
of
a
sample
unfortunately
this
was
not
one
of
those
times
and
this
beer
tasted
just
as
bad
as
it
did
the
first
time
i
tried
it
average
indistinct
worth
a
try
but
probably
not
worth
the
price
over
the
long
haul
poured
from
the
bottle
beer
was
standard
macro
lager
medium
gold
color
light
head
that
didnt
last
long
with
minimal
to
no
lacing
the
smell
and
taste
both
mild
some
yeast
and
grass
scents
and
flavors
mouthfeel
was
light
some
decent
carbonation
not
too
much
aftertaste
all
in
all
ok
drinkability
a
rather
dull
flavor
profile
keeps
the
marks
down
here
it
is
easy
to
drink
this
quickly
but
it
quickly
becomes
boring
pours
a
clear
light
golden
color
minimal
head
aroma
is
corny
and
grassy
with
minimal
hop
aromas
mostly
rice
taste
is
a
bit
lacking
but
pretty
much
uniform
for
the
style
light
in
flavor
but
not
as
crisp
as
i
would
have
hoped
okay
drinkability
but
i
wouldnt
search
this
beer
out
again
d
pretty
good
this
is
a
great
light
pils
alternative
to
bmc
for
a
day
out
on
the
lake
or
by
the
pool
this
has
some
good
session
potential
on
a
hot
day
well
this
beer
isnt
going
to
set
the
world
on
fire
thats
for
sure
its
a
colorbynumbers
pale
lager
with
a
cerealbased
flavor
slight
earth
bitterness
and
a
somewhat
unpleasant
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
way
to
thin
and
overly
carbonated
too
overall
this
wouldnt
be
my
first
choice
if
i
wanted
a
light
euro
but
its
drinkable
if
youre
presented
iwth
pours
a
pale
straw
color
into
a
glass
with
a
nice
dense
head
that
sticks
it
shares
its
smell
with
european
lagers
in
green
bottles
skunky
the
flavor
is
farily
unique
but
might
have
been
better
if
it
werent
foir
the
skunk
it
has
grassy
and
herbal
flavors
distinguising
itself
from
your
standard
lager
soft
on
the
palate
light
and
creamy
it
reminds
me
of
a
lighter
version
of
grolsch
thanks
jason
b
bad
this
is
a
beer
in
all
respects
identical
to
middleoftheroad
american
macro
heres
a
good
example
of
a
middleoftheroad
european
style
macro
lager
the
beer
pours
yellowgold
its
very
clear
and
had
a
pure
white
head
that
left
lacing
on
the
sides
of
my
glass
the
taste
was
crisp
and
moderately
hoppy
and
the
beer
had
an
overall
pleasant
flavor
this
was
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
nothing
complicated
nothing
hidden
just
a
garden
variety
euro
macro
dont
go
out
of
your
way
to
look
for
it
but
its
worth
a
try
if
you
find
it
drinks
a
little
above
average
no
new
ground
broken
here
but
would
take
this
over
bmc
anyday
about
the
same
as
most
eurolager
zzz
im
sure
there
is
better
beer
from
new
zealand
but
this
the
steiney
light
are
sadly
all
i
know
drinkability
nice
hot
weather
pils
or
lager
whatever
the
hell
you
call
it
not
offensive
except
the
initial
smell
but
nothing
to
shake
a
stick
at
either
they
have
good
sales
in
the
grocery
stores
for
this
cant
argue
much
with
a
12pk
for
less
than
10
keep
some
on
hand

pale
lager
a
fizzy
yellow
beer
clear
pale
gold
color
white
foam
was
formed
with
the
pour
but
no
retention
or
lacing
to
speak
of

is
as
expected
grainy
grassy
and
that
euroskunk
that
i
just
can
never
get
used
to
no
real
flavors
to
it
tastes
like
it
should
with
a
bit
of
metallic
aftertaste
carbonation
is
ok
giving
it
a
thin
yet
appropriate
mouthfeel
hot
weather
easy
drinker
but
for
the
extra
import
price
not
really
worth
it
basically
this
is
just
a
generic
eurostyle
lager
with
nothing
special
going
for
it
though
generally
drinkable
and
not
too
bad
it
has
some
taste
and
apearance
problems
for
the
price
its
not
worth
it
with
a
million
other
beers
offering
the
same
thing
drinkability
pretty
drinkable
you
have
to
watch
it
tho
with
this
dumb
green
bottles
its
not
hard
to
get
a
skunky
one
cheers2beers
da
i
find
this
style
to
be
a
bit
boring
and
this
offering
is
no
exception
smallish
green
bottle
no
freshness
notes
this
one
pours
very
light
very
clear
and
very
grassyskunky
in
the
nose
snow
white
head
a
few
sips
and
its
clear
that
this
is
the
dreaded
pissy
yellow
euro
macro
pale
lager
piss
water
that
most
of
us
hate
no
big
suprise
that
most
of
this
ended
up
down
the
drain
instead
of
down
the
hatch
spend
your
money
on
better
beer
then
this
looked
and
poured
a
very
lager
like
yellow
very
little
head
to
speak
of
smell
of
slight
skunk
probably
due
to
the
green
bottle
syndrome
slight
hint
of
malt
followed
by
sharp
bite
from
the
hops
finishes
quite
clean
and
would
make
a
nice
summer
time
lager
served
cold
if
you
could
find
a
fresh
pack
feels
like
flat
tonic
water
but
with
less
of
a
body
it
just
feels
like
theres
nothing
to
this
brew
this
is
a
beer
id
not
buy
or
want
to
drink
again
it
just
sucks
there
are
much
better
brews
that
fit
this
style
that
are
much
better
out
there
sure
its
easy
to
quaff
but
why
this
is
one
beer
ill
not
be
revisiting
they
americanized
this
beer
i
had
one
several
years
ago
and
found
it
to
be
skunky
i
bought
a
6
pack
recently
of
the
new
version
on
the
reccomendation
of
a
friend
i
poured
the
first
one
in
a
frosted
pilsner
glass
nice
head
that
hung
around
all
the
way
through
it
was
much
different
than
my
first
try
light
tastey
no
bite
or
skunkyness
i
drank
the
next
5
right
out
of
the
bottle
good
beer
not
too
expensive
i
bought
more
and
genuinely
like
this
beer
im
bringing
2
cases
to
my
broinlaws
super
bowl
party
and
expect
this
beer
might
have
a
few
more
fans
after
they
try
it
not
a
terrible
beer
but
it
lacks
some
character
to
it
i
could
easily
have
more
than
a
couple
of
these
guys
and
not
think
twice
i
dont
know
enough
about
this
beer
or
the
brewery
but
i
suspect
it
might
be
the
bubmiller
light
of
new
zealand
around
available
acceptable
in
a
pinch
or
out
of
a
cooler
at
a
10
a
m
tailgate
i
dont
pour
beer
down
the
drain
but
this
stuff
was
putrid
i
hope
they
have
other
offerings
in
new
zealand
light
and
refreshing
in
the
mouth

very
drinkable
brew

a

with

i
also
picked
up
a
faint
skunk
note
when
first
poured
could
be
the
green
bottle
nice
malty
flavor
balanced
on
the
bitter
side
almost
like
a
pilsner
in
the
hop
character
but
not
as
hoppy
would
consider
this
in
the
category
of
light
lagers
well
carbonated
finishes
dry
and
with
a
bit
of
hop
astringency
nice
beer
for
a
hot
summer
day
enjoyed
in
a
bottle
in
hawaii
a
long
time
ago
and
then
found
it
again
just
recently
in
my
local
store
i
remember
watching
coverage
of
the
198990
whitbread
roundtheworld
sailing
race
when
the
new
zealand
boat
steinlager
2
skippered
by
the
late
sir
peter
blake
won
every
lega
rare
feat
now
i
know
what
they
were
racing
to
get
on
the
other
end
really
an
excellent
beerand
euro
pale
isnt
one
of
my
favorite
styles
this
is
more
of
an
australian
lager
e
g
boags
fruityveggie
flavor
a
bit
exotic
and
like
the
boat
adventurous
worth
trying
d
i
find
this
beer
to
be
well
balanced
and
quite
refreshing
im
digging
on
the
blend
of
dry
and
sweet
one
of
my
favorite
warm
weather
beers
a
beer
i
will
turn
back
to
again
and
again
23
5

sweet

and
musky
hops
grassy
hops
are
evident
in
the
body
combined
with
a
decent
maltbased
background
ever
so
carbonated
and
a
body
that
resembles
a
spritzy
sodabubbly
and
bland
grainylike
finish
with
a
cleansing
palate
easy
enough
to
drink
not
bad
drinkabilitynotes
average
overall
not
one
that
ill
buy
this
was
brought
by
a
friend
neither
of
us
had
tried
it
if
you
put
a
bud
ice
to
my
head
and
told
me
to
drink
the
steinlager
id
do
it
and
ill
sure
as
hell
drink
it
for
free
but
its
not
great
easy
to
drink
uncomplicated
it
is
what
it
is
i
think
this
would
be
a
good
light
weight
beer
for
burger
and
fries
the
99
cent
price
tag
for
the
big
bottle
increases
the
drinkability
average
mouthfeel
not
at
all
drinkable
im
glad
that
i
just
sprang
for
the
single
instead
of
the
sixer
this
beer
really
wants
to
be
a
eurostyle
lager
but
it
gets
the
whole
thing
wrong
its
got
the
look
but
not
the
substance
pours
a
pale
straw
yellow
with
white
head
skunky
aroma
that
is
also
a
bit
musty
with
some
grass
and
grain
as
well
taste
starts
out
malty
but
quickly
turns
bitter
and
skunky
the
longer
it
sits
overall
this
is
just
another
average
lager
that
doesnt
do
much
for
me
this
brew
pours
a
clear
straw
color
with
a
huge
fluffy
white
head
three
fingers
in
height
lacing
is
thorough
the
aroma
is
suprisingly
more
hoppy
than
i
ever
would
have
imagined
noble
hops
with
a
touch
of
cirtus
dominate
the
noise
the
taste
isnt
quite
as
bold
as
the
aroma
but
is
nice
nonetheless
the
mouthfeel
is
a
touch
ligher
than
medium
bodied
with
lively
carbonation
overall
if
memory
serves
me
correctly
this
is
one
of
the
best
euro
lagers
i
have
ever
had
i
would
certainly
drink
this
beer
again
overall
not
terrible
but
not
anything
to
write
home
about
the
flavor
comes
across
lightly
and
the
finish
is
smooth
and
nonoffensive
this
might
serve
as
a
nice
thirst
quencher
with
some
spicey
bbq
or
wings
only
paid
0
99
for
the
25
5oz
bottle
which
makes
it
hard
to
complain
life
is
short
drink
something
else
pours
to
a
golden
color
with
a
pillowy
white
head
that
lingers
throughout
and
excellent
lacing
aroma
is
floral
hops
taste
is
more
of
the
hoopy
floral
with
grassy
taste
more
evident
at
midglass
finish
is
dry
with
lingering
floral
aftertaste
an
okay
beer
but
nothing
great
while
drinking
beer
beyond
its
best
by
date
is
usually
not
a
problem
having
a
lager
sit
for
a
year
and
a
half
is
pushing
it
my
can
produced
a
halfinch
head
that
stayed
a
long
time
the
beer
was
bright
yellow
with
some
flakes
in
it
not
good
but
since
a
friend
imported
it
to
amsterdam
from
new
zealand
i
just
hated
to
throw
it
away
so
i
drank
it
despite
the
foggy
appearance
it
wasnt
all
that
bad
really
but
my
ratings
dont
mean
much
its
a
subpar
eurolager
too
watery
no
real
flavor
bland
overall
this
has
such
a
corn
flavor
it
amazes
me
ill
pass
on
this
in
the
future
mouthfeel
drinkability
the
beer
is
just
shy
of
medium
bodied
the
beer
is
well
carbonated
this
beer
beer
isnt
a
bad
beer
the
beer
was
easy
to
drink
for
0
99
for
25
4
oz
this
is
a
ok
beer
for
easy
consumption
i
sampled
this
one
with
my
wife
its
a
very
clear
gold
color
with
a
fizzy
uninspiring
foam
the
aroma
is
of
pale
malt
with
a
modest
sulfur
background
and
a
little
slight
hint
of
hops
the
taste
is
a
little
grainy
with
some
cereal
ajunct
flavor
and
a
little
sweetness
theres
a
fleeting
caramel
flavor
as
well
medium
mouthfeel
given
the
style
and
modest
carbonation
the
finish
is
crisp
and
clean
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
at
all
its
not
outstanding
and
certainly
isnt
interesting
still
its
thirst
quenching
and
fairly
enjoyable
its
a
dinkable
no
frills
lager
this
poured
from
the
bottle
a
pale
yellow
with
a
2mm
head
sitting
at
the
top
of
the
glass
smell
is
horribly
skunky
consequence
of
being
in
a
green
bottle
i
reckon
it
really
doesnt
taste
that
bad
hops
are
prevalent
and
some
malt
notes
too
but
because
of
the
skunk
it
really
doesnt
go
down
that
well
a
little
harsh
and
difficult
to
down
unless
i
can
get
this
in
a
can
i
doubt
ill
be
trying
it
again
any
time
soon
overall
an
average
to
above
average
pils
nice
and
spicy
seemed
a
bit
fresher
and
smoother
than
its
continental
relatives
fizzy
typical
and
unexiciting
mouthfeel
again
lawnmower
beer
great
served
ice
cold
on
a
hot
day
i
could
really
used
one
earlier
today
despite
the
34
litre
size
still
very
drinkable
and
cheap
to
opinion
well
this
beer
doesnt
suck
it
is
ok
a
bit
out
of
balance
for
my
taste
but
is
still
pretty
decent
i
will
finish
the
hugeo
bottle
but
that
will
probably
be
enough
for
me
for
quite
a
while
smells
sweet
corny
but
aromatic
almost
with
a
bit
of
spice
pours
to
a
pale
golden
yellow
with
a
nice
head
flavor
starts
sparkly
and
sweet
with
a
very
slight
bitter
finish
seems
kind
of
bland
in
the
middle
not
much
backbone
to
speak
of
refreshing
but
not
a
stand
out
poured
a
pale
yellow
color
with
massive
white
head
smell
is
very
minimal
with
only
a
slight
maltiness
detected
taste
is
also
very
mild
with
some
malt
present
and
a
moderate
bitterness
at
the
finish
leaving
a
pleasant
dryness
average
at
best
but
not
a
beer
is
revisit
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
a
good
hot
weather
thirst
quencher
but
otherwise
not
a
particularly
attractive
choice
it
is
average
to
below
average
in
almost
all
respects
it
reminds
me
of
most
macros
although
i
think
its
probably
better
than
most
american
macros
anyway
i
would
drink
steinlager
again
but
i
hope
to
have
better
choices
at
hand
drinkabilitynotes
overall
a
fairly
medicre
example
of
the
style
not
particularly
well
made
the
attenuation
and
tannins
suggest
that
the
grain
bill
might
have
been
pushed
beyond
its
reasonable
limits
appears
a
bright
clear
straw
golden
and
it
forms
a
nice
large
cloudy
white
head
textured
like
a
stay
puff
marshmellow
forms
a
rising
biscuit
center
with
scattered
lacing
as
it

aroma
contains
nice
grassy
and
toned
down
citrus
notes
from
the
hops
and
mild
sweetness
from
lightly
toased
malts
character
adding
another
country
to
the
list
ive
had
in
the
past
and
it
sometimes
takes
awhile
to
revisit
however
with
this
one
i
have
no
idea
why
im
guessing
availability
it
was
in
every
corner
grocer
in
cali
while
i
just
now
ran
into
recently
in
southeastern
ohio
flavor
is
nice
with
a
even
bitterness
with
more
of
that
grassy
euro
esque
hop
character
slight
biscuit
sweetness
very
easy
going
even
flavor
but
its
pretty
flavorful
especially
for
the
style
some
may
call
this
one
another
skunk
but
im
a
fan
tasty
brew
very
refreshing
i
drank
a
couple
this
past
fathers
day
weekend
outdoors
in
90
degree
weather
and
enjoyed
it
pretty
thoroughly
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
not
thin
even
carbonation
doesnt
bring
about
any
unnecessary
burps
drinkability
is
good
especially
with
some
grillin
foods
great
tasty
euro
lager
for
me
one
of
the
better
ones
overall
a
bit
rough
around
the
edges
solvent
aroma
and
nothing
special
in
the
flavor
do
not
help
either
the
color
is
a
pale
golden
with
high
carbonation
head
is
a
medium
height
aroma
is
of
sweet
grains
and
herbal
hops
despite
a
green
bottle
there
was
no
skunking
taste
is
very
fullflavored
a
nice
sweet
malt
grainy
with
an
edge
of
honey
is
joined
by
an
herbal
hop
no
offensive
adjunct
flavors
are
noted
the
is
very
flavorful
and
has
a
fresh
taste
this
is
one
of
the
best
of
this
style
that
ive
sampled
very
european
clean
hoppy
and
bitter
along
the
lines
of
a
north
german
pils
quaffable
eric
overall
impression
over
stretched
the
grain
bill
too
dry
hop
taste
is
a
bit
off
not
skunked
though
surprised
given
the
green
bottle
this
is
crystalclear
gold
with
a
little
bit
of
white
head
the
smell
is
lightstruck
skunky
which
isnt
too
big
a
suprise
given
the
green
bottle
used
as
its
means
of
conveyance
smells
like
your
generic
green
bottled
european
import
lager
more
skunk
on
the
palate
along
with
adjunct
the
flavors
are
light
and
low
and
the
finish
is
watery
this
beer
would
be
completely
neutral
except
for
its
skunkiness
which
instead
puts
it
squarely
on
the
wrong
side
of
average
a
completely
average
massproduced
lager
im
glad
i
only
bought
a
single
bottle
nzs
budweiser
and
much
better
than
bud
at
that
appetizing
smell
and
decent
appearance
taste
is
light
on
both
malt
and
hops
and
balanced
at
that
so
neither
is
very
distinguishable
there
really
isnt
enough
flavor
for
a
beer
lover
even
bud
has
more
flavor
even
if
it
is
a
bad
flavor
you
would
think
that
a
country
so
good
a
rugby
would
also
be
enthusiastic
about
their
beer
i
blame
christianity
for
giving
prohibition
a
foothold
and
stripping
nz
of
their
variety
the
beer
pours
a
pale
gold
color
with
a
towering
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
average
it
has
a
light
pale
malt
and
adjunct
scent
that
is
accompanied
by
a
nasty
green
bottle
skunkiness
its
dry
and
a
bit
bitter
the
taste
is
average
also
it
starts
rather
nicely
with
some
pale
malt
flavor
but
quickly
turns
bitter
and
skunky
with
some
residual
sweetness
in
the
finish
it
has
a
dry
and
somewhat
fruity
lager
yeast
presence
as
well
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
it
is
a
lowmedium
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
an
average
lager
at
best
it
has
too
much
of
that
nasty
skunkiness
for
my
taste
its
one
and
done
for
me
da
little
disappointed
in
this
one
i
really
was
hoping
for
more
flavor
but
it
isnt
there
might
be
good
for
the
summer
perhaps
after
yard
work
on
a
hot
day
a
clean
very
pale
yellow
beer
has
a
very
small
white
head
that
disapears
quickly
light
citrus
notes
up
front
in
the
aroma
with
a
light
grassy
character
in
the
background
the
taste
starts
with
a
light
lemony
citrus
note
that
quickly
fades
followed
by
a
quick
snap
of
a
peppery
hop
bite
on
the
finish
this
new
zealand
beer
is
a
fairly
new
arrival
to
the
omaha
market
the
green
bottle
turned
me
off
but
i
found
a
single
of
it
so
i
said
what
the
hell

i
am
glad
i
did
will
i
go
back
to
this
in
the
future
i
dont
know
i
liked
it
fine
but
i
still
have
quality
control
issues
stick
this
in
a
brown
bottle
lower
the
price
a
tad
and
it
would
be
a
winner
still
imo
dont
avoid
trying
this
because
it
is
damn
easy
to
drink
purchased
in
omaha
try
one
pale
and
clear
lessthangold
color
big
frothy
head
with
giant
bubbles
and
not
a
lot
of
lasting
power
laces
are
minimal
some
rings
and
marks
on
the
glass
mild
aroma
some
senses
of
honey
and
canvas
mouthfeel
is
light
carbonation
more
than
average
flavor
has
some
of
those
canvas
qualities
wet
hay
a
camping
trip
but
overall
quite
a
bit
of
sweetness
in
front
middle
and
end
slightly
insipid
and
offputting
as
it
winds
down
like
cheerios
cereal
with
lots
of
sweetener
added
in
in
some
ways
i
dont
actually
think
this
beer
is
as
well
done
as
some
tighter
american
lagers
it
could
actaully
use
a
sense
of
crispy
fade
to
punctuate
the
ending
a
bit
more
smooth
and
creamy
mouthfeel
for
such
a
light
bodied
lager
there
are
better
beers
in
nz
than
this
for
sure
worth
a
try
big
ass
bottle
for
fairly
cheap
price
looks
like
a
dull
golden
color
with
a
medium
to
small
foamy
head
carbonation
seems
low
aroma
is
quite
skunky
i
know
its
the
hops
but
theres
a
ridiculous
nasty
skunky
smell
here
after
a
bit
i
get
some
grainy
dry
maltiness
but
the
skunky
hops
and
yeast
dominate
flavor
is
less
skunky
but
still
strong
on
the
hops
not
really
too
smooth
either
this
is
definitely
more
pils
like
than
lagerish
very
straightforward
beer
to
boot
grainy
malts
up
front
and
a
strong
euro
hop
finish
body
is
medium
and
drinkability
isnt
too
great
rather
uninteresting
and
overly
skunky
hopped
for
what
its
supposed
to
be
imo
worth
a
try
especially
if
you
want
a
bit
more
hops
bite
than
typical
american
lagers
this
new
zealand
breweries
beer
distinguishes
itself
from
the
hordes
of
lackluster
epls
by
looking
like
a
dream
and
by
being
much
hoppier
than
most
given
the
unfortunate
reality
that
a
beer
brewed
half
a
world
away
is
unlikely
to
reach
the
plains
of
iowa
in
its
ideal
state
i
have
no
trouble
believing
that
steinlager
is
a
beer
to
contend
with
on
its
native
soil
immediate
impression
was
this
is
ballantine
which
i
didnt
mind
that
much
so
skunky
a
tad
metallic
it
poured
with
very
little
head
and
little
head
retention
with
limited
cabonation
and
was
lighter
yellow
again
it
seemed
like
ballantine
mouth
was
that
of
heineken
light
minimum
foam
light
alcohol
this
was
shaping
up
to
be
less
than
average
and
the
taste
not
a
strong
as
ballantine
not
as
sharp
as
heineken
certainally
better
than
bmc
beers
but
it
was
just
another
yellow
fizzy
beer
with
an
import
price
that
didnt
meet
even
the
minimum
that
would
make
me
buy
this
again
the
jwd
beers
are
far
better
and
cost
way
less
pours
a
offyellow
color
with
a
thick
white
head
the
smell
is
skunky
and
slighly
sweet
the
taste
is
pretty
much
the
same
with
bitter
and
baking
soda
flavors
in
the
aftertaste
i
wasnt
expecting
a
great
deal
from
this
beer
so
im
not
very
dissapointed
its
drinkable
and
thats
about
all
mouthfeel
is
pretty
basic
i
doubt
id
buy
this
again
but
it
was
worth
a
try
overall
too
brash
for
my
taste
otherwise
an
unremarkable
lager
if
you
can
find
it
fresh
and
protected
from
the
light
try
it
its
a
quaffable
lager
that
should
have
no
pretensions
but
its
a
passable
beer
pale
yellow
coloured
clear
brew
medium
carbonation
not
much
of
a
head
but
a
nice
lacing
smells
very
skunky
underneath
is
a
bit
of
mild
bready
maltiness
not
much
exciting
here
to
speak
of
taste
is
very
dry
and
the
malts
are
a
bit
on
the
overroasted
side
a
slight
almost
grapefruity
hop
sourness
and
a
mild
sweetness
but
not
much
mostly
sour
aftertaste
sparkles
on
the
tongue
then
sticks
in
throat
this
is
just
not
an
exciting
beer
to
me
ive
had
better
bottles
of
this
in
the
past
i
think
it
has
a
hard
time
surviving
the
trip
over
pours
out
to
a
nice
golden
color
with
a
full
and
cotton
like
white
head
some
notes
of
lace
medium
level
of
carbonation
aroma
is
of
burned
malts
and
stale
earth
hope
this
isnt
indicitive
of
the
other
5
in
the
fridge
ugh
luckily
the
taste
is
a
welcome
change
to
the
smell
cooked
veggies
medium
malts
hops
and
some
hay
and
grain
not
bad
mouthfeel
is
pretty
good
the
carbonation
makes
this
brew
more
quaffable
than
most
drinkability
is
average
i
could
take
or
leave
this
i
will
sample
a
couple
of
other
bottles
and
see
about
the
aroma
it
really
kills
the
enjoyment
of
the
beer
this
is
just
an
exceptional
beer
i
would
consider
this
a
faultless
pils
and
the
finest
ive
ever
had
even
next
to
prima
i
wonder
why
i
havent
bought
this
in
so
long
as
i
used
to
drink
quite
a
bit
of
it
when
i
was
younger
i
could
drink
these
all
day
long
as
soon
as
i
popped
the
top
i
was
immediately
reminded
of
what
i
have
been
missing
highly
highly
recommended
the
high
light
of
this
beer
was
when
it
poured
a
nice
light
golden
yellow
the
rest
was
all
down
hill
after
that
the
smell
was
of
weak
hops
and
really
nothing
else
the
flavor
was
really
not
impressive
it
was
someone
soaked
his
dirty
socks
over
night
in
the
vat
move
over
here
comes
and
lousy
beer
pours
a
twofinger
white
head
that
lasts
and
leaves
a
good
lace
crystal
clear
golden
color
nose
is
grainy
hoppy
medium
carbonation
and
light
bodied
starts
and
finishes
hoppy
with
a
lingering
aftertaste
reminds
me
of
the
american
macros
without
the
skunky
nose
1
35
for
a
330ml
bottle
from
rsvp
liquors
portland
me
overall
this
is
a
reasonable
beer
if
it
wasnt
so
freaking
weird
i
think
id
like
it
more
but
its
damn
confusing
as
it
stands
drinkability
2
5
12
oz
green
bottle
pours
a
clear
goldenstraw
color
with
a
good
creamy
white
head
that
lasts
with
some
lacing
grainy
and
flowery
aromas
bready
cracker
flavors
with
a
mild
sweetness
that
has
some
dryness
in
the
finish
light
bodied
with
a
watery
and
kind
of
thin
mouthfeel
this
beer
looks
great
but
thats
about
it
drinkability
is
pointless
on
this
one
you
would
be
better
served
to
get
yourself
a
glass
of
water
i
have
had
many
macro
light
beers
with
more
body
and
flavor
than
this
one
after
carbonation
gives
way
this
ends
rather
creamily
this
tastes
much
better
than
the
average
adjunct
there
is
little
of
note
here
but
it
would
be
pleasantly
refreshing
without
the
aforementioned
creaminess
the
flavour
is
slightly
chalky
and
salty
think
soda
water
and
a
little
fruity
despite
hops
dominating
malt
this
is
a
cut
above
most
american
mass
consumption
lagers
but
still
an
also
ran
in
the
quality
stakes
yellowish
heavily
carbonated
pour
a
bit
of
hops
and
grass
on
the
nose
but
a
bit
too
light
to
stand
out
grainy
with
something
resembling
flax
on
the
tongue
not
quite
hoppy
id
say
it
was
chewy
but
it
was
more
like
slimy
residue
when
nothing
else
was
available
it
was
at
least
a
new
brew
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
to
serve
with
spicy
food
but
its
kinda
like
a
macro
lager
to
me
just
eh
cold
and
refreshing
but
uninvolving
25
4

green
bottle
appearance
is
clear
light
yellow
with

aroma

initial
taste
is
of
sweet
malt
and
brown
sugar
and
dough
there
are
lots
of
hops
here
and
they
overcome
the
malt
allspice
and
grains
leave
a

on

like
spice

but
dry
and
clean
not
good
not
bad
pale
golden

that
survived
the
green
botle
and
light
quiet
good
but
litle
skunkyness
there
taste
is
fresh
and
tasty
but
light
maltyness
there
and
good
and
fresh
hopbitterness
that
gives
the
beer
a
litle
fruity
carracter
not
to
much
of
everything
but
actually
quiet
enjoyable
on
a
hot
night
like
this
another
pale
lager
import
into
ontario
not
the
worst
of
its
style
some
thirst
quencher
on
an
oppressively
hot
day
nothing
much
to
look
at
colourwise
a
bit
of
temporary
foram
some
substance
in
the
taste
malt
and
some
yeast
malty
balanced
aftertaste
pours
a
piss
yellow
amber
lots
of
head
and
a
surprising
amount
of
lacing
on
the
glass
smells
like
light
malts
little
bit
of
skunkiness
grassy
smell
tastes
like
grass
too
weird
skunky
fresh
cut
grass
taste
little
bit
of
bitterness
in
the
finish
theres
this
really
nasty
flavour
too
it
like
alcohol
but
even
weirder
the
kind
of
an
anise
flavour
i
remember
this
being
better
medium
carbonation
and
smooth
mouthfeel
kind
of
watery
not
very
appetizing
got
this
one
in
maui
and
tried
it
just
because
of
their
lack
of
choices
the
appearance
of
this
is
typical
to
swill
lager
like
heineken
or
amstel
the
smell
is
a
little
foul
and
skunky
with
a
gymsock
backing
the
taste
had
an
a
vegetable
aspect
to
it
with
a
sour
grain
finish
the
mouth
feel
was
a
little
acidic
and
unpleasant
i
really
couldt
imagine
drinking
any
more
than
1
or
2
of
these
my
guess
is
this
stuff
would
throw
you
a
wicked
hangover
330
ml
bottle
at
a
bar
in
london
pale
golden
sparkling
beer
poor
head
moderate
hops
and
grass
in
the
aroma
a
tolerable
amount
of
hops
in
the
flavour
makes
this
beer
a
little
better
than
the
average
swill
lager
wont
buy
again
though
i
you
want
a
good
nz
lager
look
for
emersons
in
stead
drinkability
easy
to
drink
but
it
will
makes
you
burp
easily
too
in
reason
of
its
high
carbonation
levels
not
a
so
bad
product
but
i
have
seen
better
too
this
is
not
a
good
beer
though
its
definitely
better
than
canadian
or
blue
it
pours
a
bland
very
pale
straw
color
with
an
almost
non
existent
head
and
a
tiny
bit
of
lace
the
smell
is
of
vegetal
dms
and
a
slight
wiff
of
hops
the
taste
is
the
same
with
some
thin
malt
flavor
in
the
back
and
a
nasty
metallic
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
very
thin
and
watery
with
prickly
carbonation
just
another
macro
lager
a
limpid
golden
yellow
beer
with
low
carbonisation
very
clear
the
head
dissapeared
really
fast
yup
this
kiwi
was
shy
i
had
no
smell
at
all
from
that
beer
very
macro
nothing
to
say
actually
her
taste
was
a
tiny
bit
fruity
unbalanced
very
matly
and
bitter
with
a
shy
bit
of
hopish
flavors
i
will
be
game
to
try
this
again
when
it
arrives
in
more
responsible
packaging
in
fact
you
might
even
hear
me
recommending
it
say
it
isnt
so
another
dissapointing
lager
pours
a
straw
yellow
with
a
fizzle
of
a
white
head
the
smell
is
very
skunky
so
much
so
it
is
hard
to
find
any
traces
of
anything
the
tase
is
again
slightly
skunk
and
earthy
grainy
tones
are
in
the
forefront
with
almost
weedy
dry
aftertaste
feels
light
and
dull
in
the
mouth
and
would
not
consider
to
have
this
anytime
soon
id
rather
not
look
at
it
again
either
bottle
poured
a
golden
colored
beer
with
a
standard
head
with
no
retention
aroma
is
a
mix
of
malts
and
skunk
which
doesnt
start
too
well
taste
is
again
dominated
by
that
skunk
taste
damn
people
should
know
that
green
bottle
are
not
made
for
imported
beer
with
a
little
bit
of
hops
overall
this
is
another
garbage
macro
lager
wont
be
seeking
this
again
anytime
soon
to
be
avoided
drinkability
is
fine
if
you
were
weaned
on
bud
lite
otherwise
steer
clear
of
this
if
this
is
anything
to
go
by
beers
in
new
zealand
arent
so
different
from
america
kiwi
beer
pours
a
standard
golden
lager
color
with
a
spittle
white
head
smells
a
bit
of
the
skunk
with
notes
of
otherwise
clean
maltiness
and
a
moderate
dose
of
hops
taste
is
full
of
cereal
grains
accented
with
some
honey
sweetness
that
is
well
balanced
by
some
slightly
metallic
hops
not
bad
but
i
think
the
southern
alps
are
the
real
reason
to
go
to
new
zealand
and
perhaps
the
girls
ahh
a
new
zealand
offering
from
the
utah
state
liquor
store
mild
skunk
aroma
accompanies
this
pale
yellow
fizzy
beer
that
contains
a
sticky
lacy
head
lots
of
grain
and
vegetables
on
the
palate
with
lingering
cereal
flavors
no
adjuncts
though
a
welcome
surprise
better
than
a
lot
of
macros
an
average
beer
at
best
though
a
clear
yellow
pour
from
a
33
cl
green
bottle
with
a
label
that
taunts
the
consumer
about
the
worlds
cup
now
thats
marketing
but
back
to
the
beer
this
thing
has
a
reasonable
head
on
it
that
lasts
through
the
drinking
session
pretty
unusual
for
a
lager
in
my
experience
lots
of
carbonation
aroma
isnt
much
of
anything
sweet
light
and
bright
with
a
slight
hops
signature
the
flavor
is
mild
unexciting
with
an
herbal
sense
and
a
sharpness
at
the
back
of
the
throat
at
swallow
generally
pleasant
better
than
many
but
not
all
that
exciting
id
take
this
over
an
american
macro
drinkability

when
will
i
learn
to
stop
buying
pale
lager
in
green
bottles
pours
a
pale
golden
color
with
a
light
whispy
headsmell
was
slightly
skunked
green
bottle
and
musty
with
some
sharp
hop
bitternes
coming
thru
taste
was
harsh
and
not
very
pleasantit
was
albeit
slightly
skunked
some
light
hoppy
notes
but
nothing
i
would
want
to
try
again
thats
for
sure
crisp
taste
with
a
bit
of
bitterness
up
front
better
than
your
average
macro
lager
but
nothing
to
get
too
excited
about
very
drinkable
smell
is
the
strong
point
i
must
agree
that
the
selfpromotion
on
the
label
worlds
best
lager
is
perhaps
taking
it
a
bit
too
far
steinlager
is
a
pleasant
drop
yes
but
hardly
exceptional
it
is
one
of
the
strongest
smelling
beers
ive
ever
had
which
is
interesting
it
ltastes
to
me
quite
a
bit
different
to
the
dutch
lagers
perhaps
the
taste
and
the
smell
are
due
to
the
use
of
nz
hops
solid
import
that
comes
at
a
reasonable
price
and
does
hit
the
spot
during
the
course
of
a
session
steinlager
doesnt
live
up
to
its
claims
on
the
label
but
its
still
a
handy
beer
on
the
whole
steinlager
has
a
strange
attraction
to
it
theres
really
nothing
remarkable
about
it
yet
it
has
an
easy
drinkability
thats
hard
to
reconcile
better
than
an
american
macro
but
not
by
much
considering
ive
used
the
word
three
times
already
all
i
can
say
its
is
clean
and
crisp
decent
drop
mediocre
beer
comes
in
a
750ml
green
bottle
with
a
nice
label
of
a
new
zealand
shore
pours
a
crispy
leaf
yellow
with
a
small
head
that
quickly
disappears
to
film
lacing
is
thick
on
the
glass
creating
nice
patterns
of
art
very
weak
smell
some
malt
and
hops
but
its
faint
slight
bitter
taste
but
it
doesnt
seem
hoppy
im
thinking
its
a
weak
hop
or
that
their
arent
enough
hops
in
this
beer
but
even
lesser
malt
like
the
nose
weak
taste
course
mouthfeel
carbonated
when
entering
the
mouth
rough
when
flowing
through
the
throat
i
wont
be
buying
this
again
its
not
that
good
tolerable
but
below
average
drinkability
on
the
pour
a
limpid
golden
color
the
head
portly
in
size
the
texture
frothy
the
color
a
bright
white
and
as
it
erodes
a
nice
concealing
sheet
of
lace
is
formed
nose
is
citrus
crisp
sweet
malt
and
a
real
pleasant
sniff
for
the
old
schnozzle
with
a
sweet
malt
laden
start
the
top
fair
to
middling
in
its
feel
to
the
palate
finish
is
pleasantly
acidic
the
hops
adequate
for
the
style
dry
lingering
aftertaste
to
finish
off
this
quite
drinkable
beer
a
great
beer
no
a
good
pleasant
session
beer
yes
and
i
do
love
those
25
4
ounce
bombers
a
pleasant
treat
during
the
record
arizona
summer
heat
ive
had
much
worse
id
definately
take
this
over
a
bud
came
in
a
hefty
green
750ml
green
bottle
time
spent
on
the
shelf
was
questionable
pours
out
a
light
gold
lager
hue
decent
carbonation
with
a
thin
head
of
foam
that
leaves
small
wisps
of
lace
did
i
get
a
bad
bottle
nose
has
a
hint
of
skunk
some
grains
that
remind
me
more
of
scotch
than
a
lager
and
a
bit
of
fruit
sweet
almost
like
apple
juice
flavour
is
also
grainy
almost
like
half
baked
bread
which
lends
itself
to
the
mouthfeel
as
well
the
hops
do
it
a
bit
of
justice
ive
had
touch
and
go
experiences
with
this
particular
beer
have
found
it
difficult
to
make
up
my
mind
for
good
as
it
has
never
remained
consistent
although
new
zealand
is
a
long
way
to
import
from
this
time
around
was
like
liquid
herbal
bread
dough
in
a
pint
glass
disappointing
qute
a
drinkable
lager
i
dare
say
if
all
you
had
ever
tasted
was
bud
difficult
to
gauge
the
taste
with
that
overpowering
hideous
smell
but
i
was
able
to
finish
the
bottle
so
it
couldnt
have
been
too
bad
malty
taste
with
no
sense
of
what
the
hops
are
doing
to
this
beer
the
bottle
says
some
kind
of
hops
grown
in
nz
are
used
for
this
beer
so
maybe
thats
it
mouthfeel
has
a
sweet
finish
to
it
that
is
bearable
drinkablity
is
also
low
mostly
due
to
the
putrid
smell
nothing
really
special
here
just
slightly
below
average
but
acceptable
it
pours
a
light
golden
hue
with
minimum
head
and
good
carbonation
the
taste
begins
with
an
assault
by
the
malts
which
is
replaced
with
a
slight
hoppy
bitterness
does
have
some
character
but
it
is
weak
looks
like
a
lager
and
smells
like
a
lager
not
much
taste
floral
hops
not
enough
malt
sort
of
tastes
like
an
alcoholfree
maltfree
beer
but
without
the
virtue
of
being
alcoholfree
hard
to
make
a
beer
this
uninteresting
definitely
plain
probably
a
good
yuppie
or
chick
beer
stick
a
lime
in
this
one
all
crap
beer
needs
a
lime
i
guess
this
would
be
a
kiwi
macro
pours
with
nice
head
smell
is
weak
hops
very
nice
carbonation
taste
is
very
crisp
good
and
malty
if
this
is
the
bud
of
new
zealand
they
have
one
on
us
americans
this
was
actually
quite
a
treat
somewhat
impressed
this
is
not
as
heavy
as
a
lot
of
imports
good
beer
to
toss
down
i
will
not
buy
this
again
as
the
bottles
are
11
2oz
what
a
rip
off
light
yellow
in
color
with
decnet
carbonation
thin
lace
smells
somewhat
grainy
with
a
very
slight
hint
of
bready
malt
grainy
flavor
with
a
sweet
malt
character
that
tries
to
stand
up
and
be
taken
seriously
warms
slightly
in
the
mouth
as
you
finish
your
glass
finishes
with
a
slight
aftertaste
of
adjuncts
notes
decent
at
best
better
than
an
american
macro
lager
but
not
much
better
could
be
confused
with
a
macro
german
lager
with
the
name
and
the
flavour
at
1
50
a
pop
i
cant
complain
too
much
floral
semidecent
brew
from
new
zealand
hoppy
suffers
from
lack
of
bitterness
though
try
one
though
dont
go
out
and
get
a
case
of
it
you
will
be
sorry
ive
never
had
a
steinlager
that
didnt
smell
like
the
assend
of
a
skunk
with
a
taste
to
match
maybe
those
ive
had
werent
properly
stored
or
were
too
old
but
they
should
at
least
try
some
brown
bottles
this
is
an
easy
beer
for
those
trying
to
get
into
beers
because
it
doesnt
have
a
lot
of
bitterness
or
much
taste
but
its
not
horrible
its
got
a
little
bit
of
sweetness
still
not
great
just
and
average
lager
maybe
a
bit
more
hoppiness
though
easy
to
drink
simple
and
boring
its
ok
when
i
think
of
beer
i
think
of
the
taste
of
svyturys
extra
not
extraordinary
but
tasty
500ml
bottle
poured
into
a
dimpled
mug
pours
cloudy
golden
with
a
very
small
half
finger
head
aromas
of
grass
citrus
and
slight
skunk
tastes
malty
but
not
overpowering
earthy
grass
taste
also
present
overall
a
slightly
above
average
lager
baltic
lager
that
has
a
nice
malt
character
hops
head
need
not
try
this
but
those
who
like
to
expand
give
it
a
shot
it
goes
great
with
central
eastern
euro
meals
im
not
a
lager
fan
but
see
this
as
good
stuff
clear
golden
color
big
white
head
aroma
of
malt
bread
and
grass
malty
taste
with
grassy
notes
minimal
bitterness
average
beer
when
you
first
pour
this
lithuanian
staple
into
your
glass
you
notice
the
pale
golden
beer
culminating
into
a
small
head
of
carbonation
that
builds
up
softly
clinging
to
the
glass
it
isnt
filtered
so
you
get
some
of
the
malty
thicker
sediment
in
each
bottle
it
tastes
of
corn
with
a
hint
of
barley
right
before
the
leafy
finish
it
doesnt
have
a
very
unique
feel
to
it
but
its
a
beer
i
would
drink
while
im
socializing
not
the
best
beer
in
the
world
but
one
i
enjoy
and
will
continue
to
drink
cheers
another
soso
halfassed
national
corporate
lager
trotted
out
as
the
best
a
country
has
to
offer
like
a
budweiser
screed
once
again
there
are
real
malt
lager
tendencies
here
but
the
corners
that
have
been
cut
almost
glow
with
precision
and
obviousness
as
far
as
im
concerned
if
this
engenders
good
feelings
about
the
land
that
you
bailed
on
then
the
rest
of
our
provincial
complement
is
all
yours
ekstra
poured
a
clear
golden
yellow
colour
with
about
1
of
shortlived
fluffy
white
head
which
left
some
minor
spotting
down
the
glass
its
aroma
was
simple
but
satisfying
being
dominated
by
sweet
malts
with
undertones
of
grassy
hops
the
beers
flavour
very
much
followed
its
aroma
beginning
with
a
strong
pleasant
malty
sweetness
which
gives
way
to
a
very
mild
hop
bitterness
with
a
clean
dry
finish
ekstra
had
a
soft
mouthfeel
and
i
would
describe
it
as
fairly
light
bodied
theres
nothing
complex
about
this
beer
it
is
simply
a
solid
enjoyable
brew
especially
for
those
like
myself
who
lean
towards
sweet
malty
tastes
at
2
35
per
500
ml
bottle
the
beer
is
reasonably
priced
and
that
lithuanian
gent
in
the
liquor
store
did
not
steer
me
wrong
pours
a
clear
light
gold
with
a
foamy
offwhite
head
that
settles
to
a
thin
cap
on
top
of
the
beer
foamy
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
grain
and
some
grassy
and
hay
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
corn
flakes
flavor
on
the
finish
there
is
a
very
mild
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
average
beer
that
is
drinkable
but
nothing
very
exciting
a
nice
lager
to
begin
with
its
well
balanced
although
it
is
quite
basic
and
the
flavours
are
all
pretty
light
with
the
exception
of
the
grassy
hops
and
lager
malts
not
a
classic
export
lager
but
a
nice
one
and
one
that
i
might
be
inclined
to
try
again
and
no
the
beer
wasnt
bad
could
us
more
carbonation
really
a
better
than
average
euro
pale
lager
there
are
countless
examples
of
the
style
out
there
with
little
to
set
them
apart
this
beer
however
has
no
off
flavors
at
all
and
is
quite
refreshing
something
i
will
seek
out
again
overall
a
very
average
lager
that
feels
like
it
would
get
tired
fast
while
the
clear
golden
sunshine
hue
is
stunning
its
missing
pretty
much
all
of
the
head
that
was
there
freshcut
hay
and
crackerlike
maltiness
in
the
aroma
uniform
smoothness
does
well
to
add
a
huge
refreshing
quality
lots
of
pale
malt
flavor
with
hints
of
baked
apple
and
delicate
floral
hoppiness
perhaps
the
slightest
suggestion
of
sulphur
here
but
its
really
not
something
that
pops
out
very
clean
throughout
with
a
finish
that
lands
dry
the
label
notes
that
it
is
unpasteurized
which
is
certainly
noticed
a
standup
lagerworth
a
go
pours
a
dark
golden
straw
the
light
meringuelike
head
is
insubstantial
yet
retains
well
enough
lacing
is
splotchy
sweet
bread
dough
aroma
and
a
good
portion
of
earthy
woody
hop
aroma
a
little
bit
of
apple
sweetness
in
the
nose
distracts
from
the
soft
malts
and
hops
and
when
combined
gives
off
a
horseblanketlike
twang
tastes
like
a
very
old
apple
pie
malts
are
sweet
and
smooth
but
does
not
finish
clean
maybe
too
much
sulphur
but
a
slight
earthymushroomy
taste
in
the
middle
hops
are
not
as
aggressive
as
in
the
nose
feels
almost
too
smooth
and
could
use
some
soluble
carbonation
not
as
dull
as
others
of
its
ilk
hazy
pale
straw
colored
with
a
decent
looking
head
of
shock
white
fizz
that
leaves
a
bit
of
lace
on
the
glass
lemon
zest
herbal
hops
and
untoasted
grain
make
for
a
pleasant
nose
on
this
one
well
balanced
but
a
bit
more
pils
than
epl
hay
and
raw
grain
with
just
the
right
amount
of
hop
bitterness
and
carbonation
to
clean
the
palate
ekstra
is
on
the
leaner
side
of
medium
bodied
with
a
seltzery
tongue
scrubbing
carbonation

above
average

lager
final
grade

a
c
ive
certainly
had
american
craft
lager
at
similar
quality
and
a
worse
price
point
bottom
line
worth
a
try
if
you
trust
your
retailer
give
it
a
whirl
there
must
be
some
good
examples
out
there
assuming
this
is
a
real
style
seems
to
me
more
of
a
lowest
common
denominator
manufactured
products
picked
up
a
bottle
at
euromarket
the
skunking
was
a
bit
rough
on
the
aroma
but
after
about
20
minutes
it
let
up
and
there
was
a
touch
of
toasty
grains
the
beer
reminded
me
of
other
northern
euro
lagers
like
okocim
as
it
has
a
little
more
character
than
heineken
but
is
still
no
pilsner
you
can
actually
taste
the
barley
and
feel
a
balancing
hops
bitterness
however
given
the
bad
condition
of
the
beer
i
probably
wouldnt
drink
this
unless
i
were
actually
in
lithuania
d
decent
attempt
at
a
brew
nothing
more
dr
poorly
priced
especially
in
ireland
and
not
particularly
a
good
beer
glad
i
grabbed
one
of
these
randomly
on
a
beer
run
and
will
definitely
try
it
again
its
not
blowing
me
away
but
could
be
a
nice
session
beer
for
the
summer
months
very
crisp
tasting
with
a
tiny
bitter
finish
drinkable
and
boring
and
generic
nothing
stands
out
here
at
all
one
of
several
decent
lagers
from
the
baltics
hops
are
maybe
a
bit
light
even
for
the
style
i
wouldnt
put
it
against
a
german
brew
but
its
head
and
shoulders
above
macrolagers
overall
basically
the
same
as
all
the
other
euro
lagers
available
in
ontario
other
than
the
fact
that
it
had
a
bit
of
a
honey
sweetness
to
it
i
wouldnt
seek
this
one
out
again
overall
ekstra
lager
seems
like
its
the
lithuania
version
of
a
macrobrew
to
me
although
better
than
its
us
counterparts
it
lacks
any
real
substance
as
someone
who
likes
to
try
as
many
new
beers
as
possible
i
do
not
resent
trying
this
especially
since
i
never
had
a
beer
of
lithuania
origin
but
i
wont
be
going
back
for
seconds
you
really
got
to
drink
this
one
cold
started
getting
hard
to
drink
halfway
through
the
first
glass
i
see
no
reason
to
buy
this
ever
again
buy
any
other
canned
euro
lager
you
can
find
in
dépanneurs
instead
i
bought
this
partly
because
i
like
trying
as
many
beers
as
possible
and
partly
because
ive
never
had
a
beer
from
lithuania
before
pours
a
pale
yellow
colour
that
starts
off
with
huge
head
but
it
dissipates
fairly
quickly
to
almost
nothing
faint
lacing
on
the
glass
smells
of
grainy
malt
with
the
slightest
hint
of
grassy
hops
clean
sweet
flavour
some
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
just
an
ok
lager
though
pretty
indistinguishable
between
100
other
european
lagers
that
we
can
buy
in
ontario
appearance
is
golden
straw
in
color
with
a
nice
thick
crisp
head
smell
of
grain
with
a
light
honey
sweetness
taste
has
that
eastern
european
lager
flavor
thats
grainy
and
ends
lightly
bitter
sweet
mouthfeel
is
light
with
good
carbonation
athough
its
nothing
exiting
its
not
bad
at
all
jake
d
drinkable
in
the
sense
that
if
youre
not
paying
attention
you
could
throw
a
few
of
these
back
take
it
or
leave
it
this
is
one
of
the
better
massproduced
overseas
epls
ive
had
i
had
to
edit
due
to
the
fact
that
this
brew
really
was
just
average
compared
to
other
beers
if
you
ask
me
those
changes
would
have
definitely
helped
although
truth
be
told
they
really
only
need
to
make
one
to
turn
this
into
an
appreciably
flavourful
and
drinkable
lager
cut
out
the
rice
that
should
be
something
that
any
brewery
with
actual
brewers
as
oppose
to
technologists
would
have
been
able
to
figure
out
on
its
own
drinkability
is
decent
fairly
poor
tasting
forgettable
beer
good
drinkability
due
to
the
relatively
low
abv
light
body
and
simplicity
no
worries
of
palate
fatigue
with
this
one
500ml
bottle
from
lithuana
lets
give
it
a
whirl
popping
the
top
this
brew
smells
alot
like
an
adjunct
macro
but
there
is
a
hint
of
the
purity
act
and
some
light
hopping
the
brew
pours
to
a
bright
yellow
with
a
bright
white
multisized
bubble
head
taste
is
lager
all
the
way
slightly
bitter
run
of
the
mill
with
good
carbonation
and
a
steady
flat
bitter
aftertaste
not
too
much
here
on
this
one
could
be
any
macro
a
little
sweeter
than
most
and
the
hopping
isnt
bad
but
this
one
doesnt
really
rate
the
fancy
foil
top
side
note
reviewing
the
bottle
it
does
list
rice
as
an
ingredient
so
this
is
an
adjunct
poured
from
a
brown
11
2
oz
bottle
has
a
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
malts
some
sweetness
taste
is
crisp
malty
a
tad
sweet
quite
refreshing
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
is
very
drinkable
overall
this
is
a
good
quality
beer
meh
doesnt
taste
like
much
but
i
suppose
theres
also
nothing
offensive
here
i
wouldnt
buy
this
again
drinkability
this
beer
might
do
on
a
warm
afternoon
looking
for
some
light
refreshment
but
on
a
cold
evening
it
doesnt
cut
it
easy
to
drink
but
flavorwise
it
will
leave
you
wanting
more
pour
is
a
yellow
with
a
wonderful
lacy
white
head
a
rather
simple
beer
of
european
caliber
to
a
american
marco
but
a
more
distinct
hop
quality
mild
lemon
zest
and
grass
nose
with
a
palate
of
basically
that
some
crisp
straw
qualities
nice
and
mild
not
sweet
like
most
americans
not
particular
yeasty
average
with
a
nice
look
and
feel
pours
a
very
clear
light
yellow
colored
body
grainy
aroma
corn
flavored
light
taste
corn
lagery
grainy
taste
very
vegetably
not
bad
but
a
little
heavy
wish
these
lagers
tasted
better
this
one
was
too
vegetably
and
corny
tasting
i
didnt
mind
this
beer
but
compared
too
how
it
looked
everything
else
was
going
to
be
a
bit
of
a
let
down
worth
trying
and
not
a
bad
way
too
knock
an
obscure
country
off
your
list
very
easy
to
drink
would
i
buy
again
only
if
very
cheap
it
was
a
gift
so
i
dont
know
the
price
overall
an
average
beer
that
is
drinkable
but
you
wont
remember
much
about
it
later
better
than
your
standard
mass
market
beers
but
below
the
good
flavor
of
most
craft
beers
rotation
avail
here
one
and
done
for
me
since
not
very
flavorful
bottle
350
ml
mmmm
not
that
bad
as
i
expected
pale
golden
colour
normal
head
that
doesnt
hold
but
leaves
some
lace
smell
is
fresh
sweet
malts
but
also
some
floral
hops
light
body
simple
pleasant
flavor
and
thirst
quenching
mouth
feel
taste
is
mostly
sweet
but
it
has
some
grain
and
lemon
touch
nothing
to
die
for
but
not
that
bad
at
all
and
its
refreshing
it
is
not
a
factor
in
the
beer
but
it
was
a
most
impressive
can
it
was
made
of
pressedaluminum
like
pressedtin
signs
so
that
the
side
and
bottom
had
wavy
grooves
plus
the
name
and
logo
were
raised
yow
it
says
proudly
on
the
can
our
very
finest
i
am
glad
i
know
that
many
lithuanian
beers
are
way
better
than
this
never
ever
again
really
not
all
that
bad
aroma
was
quite
pleasant
more
sweet
than
bitter
very
fresh
from
a
can
so
no
light
struck
probs
very
beery
poured
with
a
big
foamy
head
that
settles
down
to
a
thin
cover
and
some
lace
color
is
a
clear
pale
yellow
flavor
is
like
aroma
body
is
a
touch
thin
ok
carbonation
clean
pleasant
finish
definitely
a
session
beer
got
this
on
at
sams
in
chi
lithuanias
most
popular
beer
so
the
packaging
says
is
probably
or
at
least
hopefully
not
lithuanias
most
goodlooking
beer
in
fact
i
would
call
the
appearance
of
this
beer
insipid
a
pale
canaryyellow
littered
with
clusters
of
large
bubbles
that
rise
up
into
a
stark
white
head
with
poor
retention
not
much
to
smell
either
cornbread
tin
and
dish
soap
dominate
somewhat
odd
tasting
but
not
really
bad
with
some
unusual
processed
grain
flavors
that
are
very
reminiscent
of
corn
flakes
strange
because
if
i
am
to
believe
the
label
there
is
no
corn
in
this
beer
rummy
sweetness
sidelines
whatever
pleasantness
the
malts
may
have
to
offer
while
a
whipcrack
of
hop
bitterness
and
a
completely
unnecessary
tangent
of
alcohol
help
distract
from
the
notdryenough
finish
this
beer
is
not
as
highly
carbonated
as
it
looks
and
the
mouthfeel
suffers
for
it
strange
beer
this
one
i
can
imagine
it
being
kindasorta
refreshing
if
its
kept
exceedingly
cold
but
otherwise
not
for
me
sorry
lithuania
conclusion
this
is
a
great
quenching
beer
with
far
more
character
than
90
of
the
offerings
in
this
category
this
was
great
with
a
german
bratwurst
and
sauerkraut
i
noticed
ekstra
on
the
bottom
shelf
of
a
cooler
behind
the
bar
at
a
banquet
facility
but
it
wasnt
mentioned
when
i
asked
about
their
brands
of
beer
compared
with
the
other
choices
us
megabrands
it
was
really
a
standout
the
head
was
big
and
didnt
collapse
while
the
color
was
a
bit
hazy
the
taste
was
good
and
refreshing
not
too
fizzy
and
certainly
no
alcohol
taste
it
was
a
pleasant
introduction
to
lithuanian
beers
and
ill
be
looking
for
this
one
again
d
this
one
is
alright
but
im
not
going
to
plan
my
next
vacation
to
tour
the
brewery
d
low
abv
and
dry
finish
makes
this
a
decent
session
brew
this
is
my
first
lithuanian
beer
review
and
im
not
mad
at
the
country
for
brewing
this
i
got
it
as
a
gift
so
i
dont
know
how
expensive
it
is
but
this
is
a
solid
lager
thanks
to
vaidas
for
providing
this
bottle
adding
lithuania
to
my
map
vyturys
ekstra
is
a
sparkling
slightly
hazy
light
golden
lager
with
a
thin
dense
waxy
white
head
that
fades
pretty
quickly
but
leaves
a
little
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
bit
muted
but
slightly
sweetened
with
round
light
malt
there
are
notes
of
lemon
hay
soft
grass
and
medicine
it
is
light
bodied
and
a
bit
chalky
and
alkaline
in
the
mouth
its
actually
not
too
watery
this
beer
tastes
a
lot
boozier
than
it
is
there
is
a
strong
fusel
taste
followed
by
corn
solvent
and
black
pepper
the
hops
almost
come
through
at
the
finish
with
their
soft
grassiness
but
the
toll
of
the
alcohols
drowns
everything
out
this
kind
of
tastes
like
a
40
i
could
see
drinking
this
in
a
dimly
lit
place
while
chain
smoking
d
very
drinkable
would
not
get
again
due
to
price
but
glad
i
had
this
brew
dpaired
with
lentil
lamb
ragu
went
well
but
the
phenolic
character
somewhat
ruined
a
decent
match
remarkable
here

a

its
better
in
the

land
d
drinkable
if
a

not
a

basic
lager
by
any

i
wish
our
macro
lagers
were
even
slightly
this
tasty
here
in
the
us
fair
hit
of
yeast
on
the
front
palate
descends
into
a
slight
barely
perceptible
hop
bitterness
that
was
ripped
straight
from
the
back
label
but
its
a
perfect
description
drinkable
but
very
bland
thats
what
should
be
on
the
back
label
could
use
a
lot
more
bittering
and
just
more
flavour
in
general
pretty
poor
overall
actually
d
overall
a
beer
is
very
sweet
somewhat
bland
and
non
offensive
to
the
taste
buds
would
drink
this
over
any
of
the
american
macros
if
no
other
option
was
available
but
in
limited
quantity
this
is
a
nice
very
drinkable
dortmunderexport
it
is
categorized
here
as
an
epl
but
is
a
dortmunderexport
and
fits
the
latter
style
very
well
with
a
good
forward
taste
for
the
style
imo
pours
a
slightly
hazed
gold
with
a
white
head
nose
is
of
bitter
and
doughy
character
flavor
is
hoppy
with
an
almost
earthen
flavor
that
borders
on
tasting
dirty
feel
is
a
bit
high
on
carbonation
drinkable
sure
but
overall
this
is
basically
an
average
brew
with
nothing
interesting
or
unique
going
on
pours
a
pale
golden
straw
color
with
plenty
of
foamy
white
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
while
and
clings
to
the
glass
smells
like
noble
hops
and
yeast
and
light
malt
not
much
spicyness
or
floral
scents
but
its
still
pleasant
tastes
dry
and
a
bit
sour
at
the
same
time
not
a
whole
lot
of
sweetness
of
any
kind
but
theres
hop
flavor
there
finishes
sourdry
as
well
mouthfeel
is
foamy
and
a
little
creamy
overall
its
fairly
drinkable
as
its
not
too
strong
in
any
one
area
but
its
not
a
real
enjoyable
beer
for
me
easy
going
but
after
the
initial
taste
it
loses
its
luster
dwhy
import
something
like
this
i
am
sure
lithiuanian
expats
mightbe
looking
for
a
taste
of
home
but
this
is
awful
maybe
this
is
good
at
home
i
doubt
it
i
tried
this
beer
on
september
13
2007
at
smokeless
joe
in
toronto
the
beer
poured
a
translucent
dark
gold
with
a
thin
white
head
the
aroma
was
malty
with
hints
of
grass
the
mouthfeel
was
mediumbodied
with
high
carbonation
the
taste
was
very
grainy
all
in
all
not
bad
in
fact
it
would
hold
up
well
against
other
better
known
european
lagers
and
is
certainly
superior
to
all
the
mass
produced
ones
glad
i
tried
it
better
than
many
easterneuropean
lagers
ive
had
with
at
least
noticible
hop
character
by
no
means
an
unpleasant
experience
just
a
very
european
one
d
quite
a
drinkable
brew
with
a
pronounced
hop
presence
thats
above
average
making
it
a
good
call
whatever
the
hell
its
style
may
be
theres
not
much
to
say
that
hasnt
been
said
in
other
reviews
pretty
standard
euro
lager
here
clear
and
fizzy
appearance
faintly
malty
organic
slightly
funky
aroma
bland
but
not
particularly
clean
taste
with
a
slightly
astringent
bitterness
not
the
worst
beer
ever
but
nothing
id
ever
care
to
drink
again
i
will
give
it
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
as
far
as
mouthfeel
goes
i
tried
not
to
keep
it
in
my
mouth
long
enough
to
feel
it
i
hope
there
are
better
offerings
in
lithuania
for
the
good
people
over
there
if
not
we
must
start
a
beer
drive
immediately
nobody
deserves
this
mouthfeel
is
superlight
with
heavy
carbonation
call
me
crazy
but
it
seems
like
ive
had
this
beer
before
thank
crikey
it
was
cheap
certainly
prefer
old
mil
to
this
swill
pours
a
bizarrely
pale
clear
yellow
corny
aroma
even
more
corny
flavour
mmmm
corny
i
believe
was
grubs
reaction
mild
koolaid
grape
background
oddly
enough
maybe
it
was
just
chemicals
bleh
this
was
a
nice
easy
drinking
lager
that
has
a
real
nice
smooth
water
chemistry
that
adds
a
extra
depth
to
the
overall
flavor
profile
the
pale
gold
color
and
slight
white
cap
holds
a
nice
aroma
of
small
malt
and
a
little
balance
of
hops
the
body
was
a
medium
density
and
it
makes
for
a
good
beer
to
drink
at
the
club
or
with
dinner
thanks
for
the
sample
grub
drinkability
is
not
good
tastes
quite
sweet
pale
malt
corny
dmstype
flavors
persistent
light
noble
hops
help
to
balance
the
sweetness
and
save
the
beer
from
a
drain
pour
the
hops
are
odd
tasting
never
tasted
a
hop
profile
quite
like
it
before
mouth
is
lightly
sticky
finishes
with
the
hops
then
finishes
clean
this
is
below
average
but
not
by
much
i
was
expecting
far
worse
not
bad
not
great
ive
had
worse
national
beers
pours
very
yellow
slightly
pale
with
a
white
head
that
fades
away
quickly
smell
is
very
faint
with
a
little
bit
of
sweet
cereal
grain
and
some
soft
hops
taste
is
crisp
very
slightly
sweet
and
with
some
faint
but
noticeable
hops
tastes
pilsnerish
mouthfeel
is
pretty
crisp
with
a
good
carbonation
level
but
there
is
a
little
bit
of
soapiness
in
it
as
well
drinkability
is
soso
its
refreshing
and
not
cloying
taste
also
very
mellow
reminds
me
a
bit
of
a
weizen
some
banana
and
pear
wheat
malt
yeast
and
a
very
very
slight
lemon
acidity
im
really
confused
here
this
is
not
what
a
normal
euro
pale
tastes
like
and
the
cloudiness
is
much
more
like
a
weizen
as
well
maybe
bottled
wrong
in
lithuania
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
bitey
with
a
sharp
carbonation
maybe
a
touch
watery
but
not
terrible
i
think
this
is
an
extremely
drinkable
beer
and
im
finding
hard
to
see
what
all
the
negative
fuss
is
about
svyturys
ekstra
is
far
from
wonderful
beer
but
its
at
least
the
equal
of
its
stablemate
1784
that
is
actually
considered
to
be
a
german
pilsener
i
dont
imagine
that
theres
much
to
choose
from
in
lithuania
so
i
have
to
believe
that
lithuanians
are
pretty
pleased
to
have
some
halfway
decent
beer
a
quick
pour
yields
a
3
finger
head
which
quickly
falls
to
a
whisper
over
the
light
golden
liquid
taste
is
ghostly
malty
with
fleeting
hops
in
there
somewhere
where
this
beer
shines
is
in
the
mouthfeel
if
served
cold
its
creamy
with
an
almost
fruity
residual
aftertaste
nice
pours
a
three
finger
white
head
that
fades
quickly
to
a
thin
layer
leaving
some
lace
cloudy
light
amber
color
medium
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
slight
wheat
nose
even
though
this
is
a
lager
starts
sweet
but
hops
take
over
that
leaves
a
metallic
after
taste
amazing
that
it
won
a
gold
medal
2
69
for
a
500ml
bottle
from
johns
market
tigard
or
md
a
lightbodied
lager
semisharp
in
carbonation
and
the
texture
falls
thinner
as
it
goes
but
its
easy
to
quaff
and
benefits
from
a
bitter
edge
prevailing
from
the
midpoint
onwards
that
is
welcomed
by
a
bitterlover
like
me
not
a
lager
to
write
home
about
but
not
a
terrible
beer
either
trying
it
once
in
a
life
time
is
quite
sufficient
though
and
luckily
i
actually
didnt
pay
for
it
overall
a
pretty
poor
lager
nothing
really
to
recommend
about
it
a
surprisingly
average
i
expected
garbage
for
the
price
dortmunder
style
lager
from
lithuania
pours
piss
yellow
with
outstanding
carbonation
streaming
and
a
generous
white
cloud
that
dissipates
to
a
inch
minimal
lacing
aroma
is
quarried
rock
dust
lime
corn
powdered
sugar
and
iron
taste
is
biting
but
quickly
turns
to
corn
sweetness
with
attached
rice
notes
metallic
and
rock
notes
persist
body
is
very
light
drinkability
is
pretty
low
after
a
few
gulps
my
stomach
is
becoming
queasy
its
not
as
bad
as
some
of
the
reviews
would
make
it
sound
but
how
on
earth
did
this
win
a
gold
at
the
world
beer
cup
pours
a
hazy
golden
with
a
foamy
head
that
leaves
some
serious
white
residue
but
the
taste
isnt
too
bad
taste
is
kind
of
grainy
and
corny
leaves
a
slight
metallic
aftertaste
nothing
too
bad
has
an
odd
cracker
smell
regular
lager
color
and
head
after
that
a
little
bitter
and
malty
however
nothing
really
stands
out
just
an
ordinary
imported
dollar
bottle
of
beer
crystal
clear
thin
yellow
colour
big
fluffy
white
head
from
the
pour
thins
out
quickly
but
leaves
a
bit
of
lace
behind
sweet
lemony
aroma
smells
acidic
sweet
little
bitterness
with
lemon
theres
an
unpleasant
herbal
character
as
it
warms
slightly
metallic
finish
and
cooked
rice
towards
the
end
creamy
body
from
the
carbonation
actually
a
little
surprising
another
forgettable
eurolager
overall
a
decent
brew
a
fair
price
and
a
nice
light
bodied
change
from
the
heavier
strong
euro
lagers
that
i
have
been
sampling
these
past
few
days
apparently
it
was
in
a
world
beer
cup
2000
though
doesnt
say
if
it
won
or
not
drinkability
well
now
i
can
say
i
had
a
beer
from
lithuania
but
i
wouldnt
try
this
one
again
i
drank
the
bottled
version
of
this
beer
labeled
vyturys
1784
ekstra
appearance
is
similar
to
most
germanstyled
pilsners
a
medium
goldyellow
with
a
light
head
the
smell
is
typical
pils
a
light
hoppy
fragrance
the
mouth
feel
is
light
crisp
and
frothy
i
just
wasnt
impressed
overall
please
take
into
account
that
im
not
a
pilsner
guy
but
do
have
the
opinion
that
some
pils
are
better
than
others
this
wasnt
one
of
them
tasted
like
a
watery
version
of
a
pbr
this
is
mediocre
among
the
worst
euro
lagers
ive
tried
so
far
but
if
you
can
find
this
its
definatly
worth
a
try
it
is
relativly
cheap
and
comes
in
single
bottles
if
you
want
to
get
into
baltic
beers
this
is
a
good
starting
point
500
ml
bottle
this
beer
pours
out
a
pale
yellow
with
a
large
head
off
dense
white
foam
lots
of
rising
bubbles
well
after
the
pour
malty
aroma
with
lemon
and
grassy
hops
bready
malt
flavor
is
a
little
too
sweet
but
partially
balanced
by
the
grassy
bitter
hops
crisp
and
refreshing
light
to
medium
body
high
carbonation
not
a
very
complex
beer
but
way
better
than
some
of
the
reviews
would
have
you
believe
a
good
choice
if
you
want
a
light
refreshing
beer
mouthfeeldrinkability
cant
really
complain
this
beer
is
forgettable
and
unimpressive
i
would
definitely
skip
it
sweet
upfront
with
malts
and
some
grain
bitter
but
weak
hop
flavor
creeps
up
and
stays
in
the
finish
a
little
grassy
nothing
bad
but
not
enough
to
keep
me
interested
the
mouth
is
appropriate
and
finishes
clean
better
than
heineken
but
that
isnt
saying
much
a
good
friend
gave
me
this
bottle
i
appreciate
it
the
brewery
should
invest
all
of
the
income
it
earns
from
beer
loving
loyal
lithuanians
everywhere
in
some
better
ingredients
and
personnel
i
write
this
as
a
fan
of
baltic
lager
beer
in
general
hoppy
and
with
a
bittersweet
aftertaste
svyturys
1784
ekstra
is
solid
but
not
remarkable
the
label
on
the
500
ml
bottle
doesnt
indicate
what
type
of
beer
this
is
but
i
am
assuming
it
is
a
pilsener
i
bought
this
beer
in
the
lcbo
in
ontario
and
while
it
is
still
within
its
freshness
daterange
i
would
like
to
try
one
in
vilnius
to
make
a
fair
decision
i
found
this
most
drinkable
i
will
have
to
go
against
the
grain
on
this
one
and
declare
it
a
good
helles
wow
lithuanians
know
how
to
make
beer
who
knew
the
ekstra
pours
a
crystalclear
strawgold
body
with
yellow
highlights
beneath
a
full
head
of
bright
white
foam
that
holds
really
well
and
leaves
some
very
nice
wide
rings
of
lace
about
the
glass
the
nose
is
clean
and
bright
with
sweet
adjunct
malt
and
grassy
hops
its
lightly
crisp
in
the
mouth
with
a
moderate
carbonation
and
dextrinous
medium
body
the
flavor
delivers
a
semigrainy
obviously
adjunct
enhanced
semisweet
maltiness
backed
by
a
solid
bitterness
and
peppered
with
lemony
grassy
and
herbal
hop
flavors
it
finishes
dry
hoppy
and
refreshing
this
is
actually
a
great
beer
for
a
summer
bbq
and
it
also
pairs
well
with
a
wide
variety
of
foods
including
some
indian
and
thai
foods
i
to
am
surprised
at
how
low
this
was
rated
sure
this
is
not
my
style
of
beer
but
the
one
i
drank
was
clean
fresh
on
the
malty
side
as
it
should
be
with
a
well
placed
lemony
grassy
hop
flavor
it
poured
straw
yellow
with
a
good
but
quickly
falluing
head
frankly
i
do
not
know
what
else
someone
would
expect
out
of
a
euro
pale
lager
330
ml
bottle
now
available
in
norway
golden
colour
large
foamy
head
strong
perfumed
aroma
of
shampoo
flowers
molasses
and
green
apples
not
entirely
pleasant
flavour
is
grassy
with
lemon
notes
some
sweetness
low
bitterness
drinkable
but
no
masterpiece
poured
from
a
500
ml
brown
bottle
the
back
label
possesses
the
numbers
chart
for
a
best
before
date
but
nothing
is
notched
off
to
give
me
any
idea
of
how
fresh
this
is
pours
out
a
clear
straw
colour
with
a
massive
cloud
of
foamy
stark
white
head
a
fair
amount
of
lacing
the
heads
about
as
good
as
it
gets
regarding
the
appearance
of
this
stuff
the
nose
is
mild
with
bready
malt
and
traces
of
grain
and
corn
the
slightest
trace
of
something
resembling
hops
lingers
in
the
distance
the
flavour
while
not
bad
in
an
awful
way
is
very
nondescript
and
what
can
be
discerned
doesnt
really
paint
this
beer
more
favorably
a
very
grainy
profile
a
bit
tart
due
to
this
with
a
dry
finish
and
grainy
aftertaste
well
along
the
way
of
the
aftertaste
some
faint
herbal
hops
start
to
emerge
better
late
than
never
but
im
not
sure
why
they
bothered
at
all
the
mouthfeel
is
light
with
a
bit
of
carbonation
although
pretty
watery
overall
if
this
stuff
won
a
gold
award
like
it
says
on
the
label
then
id
be
wary
of
trying
the
rest
of
the
stuff
in
the
competition
as
well
towards
the
end
of
the
glass
im
beginning
to
contemplate
a
sink
pour
the
flavour
tends
to
degenerate
the
more
i
drink
it
as
it
warms
up
nope
ill
pass
on
this
one
next
time
what
is
it
about
most
eurolagers
i
got
through
about
a
third
of
this
despite
its
claim
to
be
an
award
winner
typical
sweet
grassy
euro
lager
taste
skunky
smell
and
almost
sickly
sweet
in
the
taste
id
prefer
bud
over
this
one
taste
now
i
am
surprised
many
here
did
negative
reviews
on
this
beer
maybe
we
should
drink
this
beer
expired
the
taste
was
shy
hops
fruit
banana
ester
with
a
sweetness
following
not
great
but
just
fine
a
shy
bitterness
also
composed
this
beer
a
tiny
bit
dry
too
not
acceptable
to
a
true
hophead
the
3rd
of
the
10
lcbo
slavic
lagers
to
be
tried
possibly
the
best
as
this
is
a
dortmunderhelles
style
and
im
partial
to
them
in
the
glass
we
see
a
pale
straw
slight
haze
rockey
2
finger
frothy
cap
with
fair
retention
and
lace
moderate
carbonation
nose
is
promising
sweet
bready
malts
over
a
slight
citrus
note
in
keeping
with
a
helles
good
lager
body
sturdy
malt
pronouncement
very
well
balanced
with
herbal
hop
presence
which
adds
some
bittering
in
the
medium
finish
the
rice
is
barely
detectable
very
nice
put
together
little
helles
and
a
heck
of
a
good
find
at
the
lcbo
as
i
expected
all
the
new
dozen
east
block
imports
to
be
bland
and
characterless
as
the
others
i
had
tried
bottle
poured
a
light
yellow
color
beer
with
a
medium
head
with
standard
retention
for
the
style
taste
is
quite
crisp
with
some
noticeable
bitterness
at
the
end
im
not
very
knowledgeable
on
the
style
but
would
say
that
i
enjoyed
it
more
then
some
other
eastern
european
lager
out
there
poured
a
pale
slightly
cloudy
yellow
straw
colour
small
white
fluffy
head
in
the
beginning
which
subsided
to
a
thing
haze
over
the
surface
of
the
liquid
decent
lacing
the
smell
is
quite
faint
and
whith
the
exception
of
a
bit
of
hops
and
a
tiny
bit
of
malt
it
really
doesnt
smell
like
much
of
anything
the
taste
has
a
little
bit
of
hoppy
bitterness
to
it
and
again
a
tiny
bit
of
malt
but
other
than
that
there
really
isnt
anything
present
here
to
get
excited
about
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
though
it
is
quite
thin
and
lifeless
i
have
had
worse
but
not
much
worse
this
isnt
terrible
but
one
can
see
terrible
from
where
this
one
stands
your
average
lager
beer
at
best
poured
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
great
pillowy
head
that
lasted
smelt
of
grain
and
gym
socks
tasted
thick
and
malty
with
a
slight
ammount
of
grain
in
there
not
that
bad
of
a
lager
but
nothing
that
stands
out
too
much
either
ok
drinkable
it
is
overly
sweet
like
a
bitburger
which
it
greatly
resembles
in
flavor
some
cardboard
uggh
this
poured
a
nice
deep
golden
smell
was
a
bit
fruity
this
tasted
way
better
than
most
of
the
eurolagers
ive
had
good
drinkability
no
problem
at
all
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
searching
for
a
new
eurolager
to
try
further
more
this
was
one
of
the
best
euros
that
ive
tried
taste
is
pure
malty
goodness
with
the
herbgrass
like
elements
luckily
the
pinchy
smell
doesnt
come
through
on
the
palate
this
is
an
excellent
gold
colored
beer
it
finishes
a
little
buttery
but
in
a
nice
fresh
way
drinkabilty
is
exceptionally
good
i
could
drink
5
of
these
no
problem
the
beer
erupts
from
the
500ml
bottle
a
limpid
gold
with
a
generous
creamy
white
head
and
after
its
demise
the
lace
forms
a
thin
sheet
to
obscure
the
glass
nose
is
sweet
malt
fresh
crisp
clean
with
the
start
somewhat
sweet
and
the
grain
profile
light
top
is
thin
in
its
feel
to
the
palate
finish
is
mediocre
in
its
acidity
the
hops
pertinent
to
the
style
with
an
alcohol
bitter
dry
aftertaste
not
that
great
overall
2
5
years
later
watery
well
put
this
offering
from
ab
svyturys
into
the
one
try
only
category
for
me
if
you
see
svyturys
ekstra
and
get
the
urge
to
try
it
do
yourself
a
favor
and
fight
the
urge
your
nose
and
palate
will
thank
you
a
pathetic
euro
lager
i
remember
years
ago
being
in
lituania
and
the
beer
was
much
better
than
this
poured
a
shiny
yellow
like
a
glowing
urine
color
uch
thin
one
finger
head
that
disipates
fast
smells
a
bit
pathetic
can
malt
go
sour
because
this
smells
like
sour
malt
short
malty
taste
sweet
bit
of
