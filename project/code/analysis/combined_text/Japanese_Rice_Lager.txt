the
taste
is
not
really
nice
too
sweet
in
the
beginning
and
throughout
some
minimal
bitterness
in
the
end
bland
tasteless
annoying
dextrose
notes
apart
from
that
its
what
you
expect
from
an
asian
beer
minimal
potency
light
and
subdued
flavour
smooth
drinkability
without
any
partyanimal
excitement
a
bland
stoic
beer
for
the
masses
i
am
sorry
but
the
review
stops
here
there
is
nothing
to
write
about
this
is
a
nothing
beer
no
taste
no
aroma
no
flavour
there
isnt
even
anything
nasty
to
say
about
it
it
is
just
an
all
round
unbeer
330
ml
bottle
clean
golden
colour
pours
a
more
than
decent
head
that
fades
almost
instantly
as
for
the
smell
i
only
can
find
grain
bread
taste
of
grain
metallic
notes
and
some
sweet
flavor
i
really
expected
less
of
this
one
nothing
special
but
it
has
a
clean
palate
and
its
very
refreshing
in
short
it
is
a
refreshing
beer
although
characterless
and
empty
you
can
drink
dozens
of
this
one
as
there
is
almost
nothing
there
this
is
the
latest
offering
from
the
province
run
liquor
monopoly
dont
these
guys
sample
the
beer
before
bringing
it
in
this
is
garbage
theres
gotta
be
some
better
beers
they
could
be
bringing
in
i
just
dont
know
why
they
wont
taste
was
very
bland
no
bitterness
and
very
few
malt
so
what
do
i
taste
a
faint
bitter
with
some
vegetable
taste
thats
it
the
big
nothing
NA
this
beer
pours
a
clear
dehydrated
urine
yellow
color
there
is
no
head
the
aroma
is
of
sweet
malt
with
hints
of
caramel
it
is
actually
quite
fragrant
for
the
style
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
to
the
aroma
it
is
alright
but
very
simple
the
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
nice
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
at
best
i
cant
see
myself
drinking
this
again
this
really
isnt
much
it
doesnt
have
any
particular
problems
it
just
isnt
much
of
anything
but
i
will
enjoy
the
low
abv
as
i
move
on
with
my
day
taste
thin
and
fizzy
mouthfeel
watery
with
rice
adjunct
flavor
this
is
a
really
easy
drinking
low
abv
cheap
beer
if
i
saw
this
on
tap
at
a
restaurant
i
would
definitely
order
this
over
any
cheap
american
lagers
pours
a
crystal
clear
plae
yellow
color
with
barely
any
foam
from
a
hard
pour
aroma
is
very
dry
and
bready
slightly
herbal
theres
something
there
that
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
maybe
its
the
rice
but
its
something
ive
never
smelled
in
a
beer
before
weird
is
this
beer
this
is
water
with
some
white
bread
soaking
in
it
it
incredibly
light
bodied
with
barely
any
flavor
in
it
i
thought
kokanee
was
the
lightest
beer
ive
ever
had
but
this
has
surpassed
it
are
all
chinese
beers
this
awful
if
so
i
never
want
another
one
overall
this
is
a
very
crisp
watery
refreshing
brew
i
could
see
having
a
few
of
these
but
not
anything
that
i
would
seek
out
pours
a
pale
yellow
with
minimal
laced
head
smells
like
a
sweeter
version
of
an
adjunct
lager
the
taste
is
very
impressive
slight
hop
flavor
with
some
malty
characteristics
its
very
tingly
on
the
tongue
and
is
very
crisp
i
am
pleasantly
surprised
i
was
expecting
more
of
a
typical
macro
adjunct
lager
here
but
for
a
beer
with
only
3
8
abv
there
is
a
lot
of
flavor
here
d
very
drinkable
mild
and
unassuming
but
very
clean
and
drinkable
hand
this
out
to
the
proletariat
and
keep
them
quiet
until
they
wonder
where
the
taste
went
overall
a
drinkable
beer
which
i
liked
better
when
very
cold
but
also
not
bad
after
it
warmed
up
a
little
hmm
not
exactly
my
cup
of
rice
siwo
should
be
renamed
awol
because
the
color
the
aroma
the
flavor
and
the
mouthfeel
are
the
next
thing
to
absent
some
of
that
spring
water
sounds
good
right
about
now
siwo
was
a
very
pale
yellow
color
and
very
clear
it
had
a
fizzy
white
head
that
instanly
disappeared
with
no
lacing
the
aroma
was
light
grainy
and
not
very
appealing
the
taste
was
light
fairly
crisp
and
a
little
grainy
with
a
dry
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
thin
and
watery
with
plenty
of
carbonation
drinkability
was
poor
this
was
not
a
good
beer
avoid
o
a
refreshing
fruity
summer
lager
nothing
groundbreaking
in
the
taste
and
its
a
bit
thin
but
its
a
perfect
hot
weather
beer
crisp
cold
with
a
hint
of
great
flavours

never

this

there
such

all

of

this
is
certainly
a
thin

of

overall
this
is
a
good
japanese
rice
lager
that
has
a
nice
dry
flavor
character
a
classic
aroma
profile
for
the
style
and
a
wonderfully
refreshing
mouthfeel
its
not
the
best
beer
around
but
for
its
style
it
is
a
fantastic
drink
pours
a
nice
golden
with
a
nice
white
head
not
much
aroma
this
is
a
typical
japanese
beer
that
is
light
and
easy
to
drink
especially
with
japanese
food
like
yakitori
you
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
easily
overall
a
decent
beer
when
bar
hopping
not
a
lot
of
flavor
or
substance
this
is
a
beer
that
i
normally
wouldnt
rate
very
highly
its
a
great
example
of
a
style
that
i
think
has
a
lot
of
problems
but
you
have
to
be
on
okinawa
to
understand
this
beer
was
tailor
made
for
okinawan
summer
evenings
any
other
place
any
other
time
and
it
become
mediocre
at
best
but
on
a
hot
humid
summer
night
overlooking
the
beach
or
sitting
in
an
izakaya
this
beers
qualities
shine
through
o
decent
japanese
rice
lager
not
my
favorite
style
food
match
sushi
is
an
all
too
obvious
choice
so
how
about
pizza
as
well
or
sushi
pizza
o
i
would
definitely
have
it
again
with
sushi
o
if
a
sushi
restaurant
has
it
i
am
ordering
it
great
to
cleanse
the
palate
after
some
spicy
tuna
i
dont
like
the
pickled
ginger
works
well
as
a
foil
to
wasabi
or
chili
peppers
yeah
its
a
rice
lager
its
not
a
bad
rice
lager
but
thats
a
pretty
low
bar
still
i
think
i
enjoyed
this
more
than
others
like
sapporo
kirin
or
asahi
it
was
just
clean
throughout
its
length
and
dry
and
crisp
on
the
finish
thats
worth
something
bought
at

orion
premium
draft
beer
pours
a
pale
yellow
with
a
thick
white
head
from
a
brown
21
4
ounce
bottle
the
aroma
is
somewhat
grainy
and
sweet
smelling
the
flavor
is
a
touch
sweet
with
a
bit
of
grain
and
a
touch
of
something
resembling
hops
this
is
a
super
light
beer
very
light
in
body
and
flavor
its
as
light
or
lighter
than
any
macro
american
light
beer
that
said
its
about
as
good
as
any
beer
ive
had
that
fits
that
category
btw
the
cap
says
for
your
happy
time
thats
probably
the
best
thing
about
this
beer
rjt
o
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
and
seems
to
be
a
lot
more
palatable
compared
to
other
beers
in
the
style
o
very
easy
to
drink
and
quite
enjoyable
this
beer
matches
well
with
a
lot
of
different
panasian
cuisines
i
have
had
this
beer
at
many
sushi
restaurants
and
continue
to
enjoyorder
it
better
than
many
others
in
the
style
overall
for
the
style
pretty
good
its
boring
and
balanced
but
basically
flawfree
and
quite
drinkable
indeed
feels
very
refreshing
and
clean
the
tingle
is
a
good
medium
feels
like
i
could
consume
a
lot
of
this
my
pour
did
not
lack
for
head
i
had
better
than
two
fingers
worth
of
dense
bonewhite
head
with
great
retention
color
was
a
sunshineyellow
with
nequality
clarity
nose
had
a
clean
lagersweetness
to
its
scent
i
am
beginning
to
understand
why
not
all
adjuncts
are
bad
just
corn
mouthfeel
was
tending
toward
full
kind
of
light
and
fluffy
on
the
tongue
with
a
pleasant
lager
sweetness
in
the
mouth
finish
had
a
real
dryness
to
it
which
was
both
unexpected
and
enjoyable
i
may
be
jaded
after
so
many
aals
in
support
of
the
canquest
tm
but
i
found
this
to
be
quite
enjoyable
now
do
not
misconstrue
what
i
am
saying
this
was
nothing
to
write
home
about
nor
would
it
be
worth
seeking
out
but
as
a
find
and
at
its
price
point
it
was
fully
worthwhile
i
would
like
to
revisit
this
in
a
can
if
possible
o
as
i
said
just
a
very
generic
lager
very
drinkable
o
in
my
limited
experience
the
best
japanese
beer
ive
tasted
recommended
highly
for
the
style
but
otherwise
not
worth
seeking
out
pours
a
crystal
clear
yellow
with
a
2
inch
puffy
stark
white
head
that
settles
to
a
small
cap
random
streaks
and
spots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
grains
rice
and
some
grass
notes
taste
is
of
sweet
grains
minor
rice
flavors
and
some
herbal
grassy
flavors
on
the
finish
a
pretty
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
but
slightly
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
rice
lager
coming
straight
from
japan
i
was
expecting
something
mediocre
but
i
actually
enjoy
this
one
for
what
it
is
much
better
than
saporro
for
sure
served
really
cold
at
sushi
place
in
new
york
city
this
is
a
very
clear
yellow
gold
with
a
very
healthy
bubbly
white
head
and
very
little
of
any
lacing
the
aroma
is
simple
clean
cereal
grain
sweet
bread
perhaps
subtle
the
taste
brings
sweet
rice
and
light
wheat
a
crisp
cereal
beverage
that
refreshes
and
goes
down
mighty
easily
the
flavor
is
steady
and
compliments
the
sushi
nicely
its
lightplus
bodied
with
a
thinish
but
lively
feel
still
it
has
a
little
chewiness
for
the
style
not
bad
at
all
for
what
it
is
designed
to
be
this
beer
is
pale
like
a
cheap
apple
juice
at
least
it
has
a
nice
white
head
the
aroma
ever
since
i
poured
it
is
like
some
type
of
stanky
lemon
and
wheat
it
kinda
yeasty
its
smells
like
a
person
whos
not
bathed
in
awhile
and
tried
to
cover
it
up
with
some
lemons
i
overexaggerate
of
course
but
the
point
remains
the
same
smooth
flavor
light
lemon
mixed
with
some
sort
of
light
lager
because
the
only
other
flavors
around
are
malt
and
mostly
mineral
water
could
be
worse
i
suppose
the
mouthfeel
is
okay
meaning
its
as
would
be
expected
per
the
style
this
beer
has
many
faults
but
as
kyle
said
we
have
had
so
much
worse
reviewed
blind
as
part
of
blind
bif
round
5
it
pours
a
clear
brass
topped
by
a
finger
of
slightly
dirty
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
wheat
grass
flowers
light
cardamom
sorta
and
a
minor
bit
o
pepper
the
taste
holds
notes
of
wheat
light
greens
light
lime
zest
black
pepper
flowers
and
some
very
light
caramel
the
body
is
a
heftyish
in
the
loosest
sense
light
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
finish
that
leans
toward
the
crisper
side
of
life
overall
a
decent
brew
really
not
all
that
bad
for
a
jpl
normally
these
things
hurt
to
drink
this
one
was
just
kinda
bland
and
you
know
kinda
there
pours
pale
straw
color
with
virtually
no
head
smells
slightly
sweet
and
light
with
a
bit
of
congee
like
aroma
the
taste
is
pretty
clean
to
start
definitely
with
some
light
clean
rice
flavors
and
a
bit
of
husky
bitterness
at
the
end
not
nearly
as
bad
as
i
feared
it
might
be
in
fact
fairly
refreshing
poured
a
2
finger
head
a
very
pale
golden
color
i
didnt
get
too
much
smell
out
of
it
it
kind
of
reminded
me
of
the
beer
i
drank
in
college
the
taste
was
crisp
but
not
really
much
after
that
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
spicy
i
would
probably
drink
it
again
just
to
hang
out
just
to
drink
this
beer
is
really
just
one
of
those
out
there
for
tickers
i
have
ony
seen
it
at
a
few
elect
places
though
d
well
its
a
beer
and
it
doesnt
taste
terrible
and
it
will
be
there
for
your
happy
time
i
would
probably
steer
clear
of
this
one
from
here
on
out
but
it
was
about
what
i
expected
d
it
was
very
light
all
around
but
drank
really
good
and
went
good
with
some
sashimi
definitely
a
sessionable
brew
drinkablity
average
if
its
on
tap
i
am
drinking
it
probably
a
little
to
irresponsibly
this
isnt
really
a
beer
that
you
would
drink
for
the
beers
sake
but
it
does
actually
compliment
japanese
cuisine
very
well
besides
that
its
just
a
typical
rice
lager
nothing
more
kirin
and
sapporo
are
better
it
may
be
on
par
with
asahi
for
me
pair
it
with
food
and
it
gets
the
job
done
atmosphere
is
decent
nice
full
foamy
head
nose
is
pretty
nondistinct
flavor
similarly
is
nothing
special
but
not
off
putting
either
overall
this
is
a
decent
quaff
clean
from
the
start
to
end
undoubtedly
one
of
the
more
flavorful
massproduced
lagers
from
japan
a
sure
pick
for
us
when
next
thinking
of
sushi
d
very
easy
to
drink
would
have
a
few
out
by
the
pool
d
very
drinkable
but
not
flavorful
enough
to
want
multiple
rounds
i
would
still
order
it
over
some
american
macros
though
just
because
it
is
a
fresh
taste
for
me
overall
impression
i
would
drink
this
again
but
i
wouldnt
pay
for
more
than
one
of
these
at
a
steakhouse
aroma
is
crisp
and
malty
ok
but
nothing
special
it
pours
a
clear
strawyellow
with
a
fairly
thick
white
head
flavor
is
rather
wan
malty
and
rather
sweet
with
just
a
hint
of
hops
again
nothing
special
but
still
drinkable
texture
is
smooth
fizzy
and
just
a
tad
on
the
thin
side
i
wont
be
seeking
this
out
again
but
it
was
worth
a
fair
shake
appearance
is
a
nice
golden
color
with
a
fine
crisp
head
smell
of
rice
with
a
light
earthy
note
taste
of
the
rice
with
good
hop
having
a
light
metallic
bitter
aftertaste
mouthfeel
has
good
body
for
a
lager
with
a
nice
spike
of
carbonation
not
bad
but
could
use
a
little
more
balance
d
a
refreshing
beer
definitely
goes
well
with
sushi
but
nothing
special
im
sure
these
rice
lagers
are
extremely
popular
in
japan
their
versions
of
bmc
lagers
or
euro
macrolagers
but
i
do
find
this
to
be
a
little
better
than
the
american
versions
i
keep
thinking
this
tastes
like
weihenstephaner
original
its
the
same
beer
the
taste
is
similarly
bland
watery
up
front
dry
and
fizzy
with
a
slight
mineral
flavor
the
midpalate
reveals
a
hint
of
malt
and
a
slight
slickness
dry
and
lightly
bitter
in
the
finish
a
clean
and
refreshing
lager
albeit
pretty
bland
this
may
not
be
everyones
beer
but
ahh
the
memories
it
pours
a
crisp
clear
gold
with
a
very
small
head
and
no
lacing
it
smells
very
similar
to
the
usa
macrolagers
except
a
bit
stronger
stronger
not
always
better
its
a
sweet
smell
with
only
a
touch
of
hops
the
taste
is
also
very
generic
its
incredibly
sweet
all
the
way
through
with
a
slightly
metallic
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
with
average
carbonation
theres
nothing
foul
in
this
beer
so
the
drinkability
is
rather
high
however
i
probably
wont
be
buying
this
beer
again
i
bought
this
mainly
for
the
novelty
of
trying
an
okinawan
beer
and
for
the
sturdy
looking
large
bottle
that
looks
great
for
homebrewing
i
didnt
have
any
expectations
good
or
bad
but
theres
far
better
beers
to
be
had
from
the
nation
of
japan
paired
this
with
sushi
and
was
pleasantly
surprised
not
great
but
not
all
that
bad
i
bought
this
for
the
novelty
of
it
similar
to
a
lot
of
light
lagers
but
a
little
bit
cleaner
maybe
d
i
guess
this
is
drinkable
as
far
as
cheap
macros
go
but
i
was
not
impressed
at
all
definitely
not
one
of
the
better
japanese
rice
lagers
sweet
633
ml
bottle
with
some
code
on
the
label
brewed
with
malt
cornstarch
corn
grits
rice
water
and
hops
its
a
crystalclear
bright
light
golden
color
with
light
carbonation
and
three
fingers
of
fluffy
head
that
leaves
a
few
patches
of
lacing
very
light
aroma
that
is
sweetish
with
a
few
notes
of
corn
and
is
almost
pleasing
really
almost
grassy
and
doughy
malt
flavors
up
front
backed
by
lemon
a
hint
of
spicy
hops
and
a
mild
bitterness
the
body
is
light
and
tingly
dry
and
has
a
short
finish
not
too
bad
of
a
beer
really
its
nice
and
refreshing
and
there
are
no
real
offflavors
a
decent
japanese
lawnmower
beer
not
that
thats
a
bad
thing
if
thats
what
youre
looking
for
there
is
some
flavor
here
and
although
it
is
basically
fizzy
yellow
beer
and
i
rated
it
accordingly
poured
up
a
very
light
crystal

with
a
one

was
a

like
100s

not

overall
this
could
go
as
a
replacement
for
water
at
lunch
or
a
picnic
it
tastes
more
like
a
watered
down
kombucha
or
some
or
tea
i
would
not
recommend
buying
it
and
if
you
get
it
for
free
you
can
be
as
lucky
as
me
this
beer
was
a
little
too
sweet
for
me
surprisingly
sweet
and
smooth
enjoy
o
overall
this
is
a
very
unique
beer
with
a
very
plain
profile
as
expected
the
alcohol
is
deceivingly
well
hidden
and
the
overall
presentation
of
the
beer
is
smooth
and
classy
overall
this
was
sake
as
beer
if
one
could
ever
imagine
it
while
this
is
an
imaginative
concept
this
beer
seemed
rushed
and
rough
about
the
edges
but
ultimately
wellflavored
generally
speaking
you
receive
the
exact
beer
that
is
advertised
the
grain
bill
from
the
very
beginning
is
intensely
foreign
and
unabashed
forcing
the
mouth
and
taste
buds
into
an
uncomfortable
conformity
that
you
soon
quickly
learn
to
appreciate
the
feel
is
intensely
drying
between
globs
of
lactic
foaminess
secondary
to
the
sake
component
of
the
beer
this
certainly
makes
things
come
across
as
a
little
boozy
that
push
to
the
liquor
side
of
life
adds
a
hard
edge
to
this
beer
that
you
can
curiously
get
behind
even
if
you
dont
particularly
enjoy
that
there
is
a
slight
clove
flavour
some
malt
also
in
aroma
but
a
huge
amount
of
meh
alright
light
almost
no
flavormalty
taste
for
the
style
pretty
decent
brew
just
some
light
beer
to
be
drunken
ironically
not
terrible

a
pinch

used
to
drink
the
hell
out
of
this
back
in
the
day
in

first
time
ive
had
this
in
20
years
its
decent
now
sweeter
than
i
remember
but
im
used
to
porters
and
stouts

a
decent

the

a

a

still

among
the
better
pale
lagers
out
there
solid
drinkable
but
not
very
good
second
time
was
way
better
nothing
special
about
this
beer
not
a
very
good
beer
at
all
had
it
japan
so
i
thought
it
would
be
better
than
what
gets
exported
to
the
us
i
was
wrong
the
sapporo
we
get
in
mexico
is
made
in
ontario
canada
and
its
not
a
rice
lager
but
an
american
adjunct
lager
very
clear
smell
apple
juice
and
rice
taste
similar
to
a
budweiser
but
also
crisp
and
a
little
dry
always
a
safe
bet
over
a
macro
lager
nice
taste
not
great
but
pretty
good
sake
bomb
sake
bomb
sake
bomb
if
i
get
it
right
its
not
japanesebrewed
one
but
ca
or
us
and
surpisingly
bad
enough
that
i
even
didnt
manage
to
drink
that
stuff
to
the
end
this
is
a
one
per
very
few
cases
i
didnt
drink
it
to
the
end
i
just
dont
get
it
i
dont
even
know
where
do
you
get
that
i
travelled
through
half
a
country
and
never
saw
this
one
on
sale
hre
in
japan
somethings
really
off
here
anyway
even
if
its
japanese
one
its
highly
unrecommended
buy
its
a
beer
beer
it
tastes
like
beer
and
nothing
more
no
dynamic
notes
for
aroma
taste
or
feel
but
i
would
not
count
this
as
a
hated
beer
for
me
if
im
eating
hibachi
this
still
gets
the
job
done
o
k
its
bad
however
i
do
believe
that
there
are
much
more
highly
rated
beers
that
are
less
refreshing
and
taste
worst
it
cleanses
my
palate
while
eating
and
ensure
i
buy
a
more
quality
brew
on
the
ride
home
from
our
favorite
japanese
place
which
is
great
overall
it
wasnt
an
enjoyable
beer
to
drink
the
can
was
really
cool
looking
though
it
tastes
like
high
life
theres
no
need
to
knock
a
macro
or
adjunct
lager
if
it
does
its
job
this
beer
was
thirst
quenching
and
tasty
and
went
well
with
my
yellowtail
and
scallion
rolls
not
something
to
pick
apart
and
scrutinize
just
gulp
it
down
and
enjoy
with
your
japanese
food
skunky
very
light
bodied
some
buscuity
taste
its
thin
and
weak
its
ok
for
the
meal
but
not
for
afterwards
decent
beer
very
typical
of
rice
lagers
almost
tastes
like
busch
to
me
650ml
can
meaning
the
beer
has
a
slight
metallic
taste
otherwise
not
bad
fairly
generic
lager
if
you
ask
me
as
far
as
jap
beer
goes
better
to
stick
with
kirin
ichiban
if
you
ask
me
fairly
clean
adjunct
lager
thats
excellent
with
sushi
overall
a
very
accessible
beer
with
a
bad
smell
is
the
can
bottle
doing
this
just
a
very
poor
tasting
beer
like
a
glass
of
bad
water
asian
beers
that
get
exported
to
canada
like
tiger
and
maybe
a
few
others
the
other
options
are
not
great
either
id
say
sapporo
is
top
of
the
range
for
asian
beer
but
maybe
i
have
no
idea
anyways
its
pretty
decent
i
like
it
for
eating
with
goes
great
with
guess
what
asian
food
haha
just
not
a
good
beer
but
whats
a
man
to
drink
when
he
wants
a
beer
at
a
small
sushi
restaurant
this
is
just
absolute
crap
brilliant
golden
color
with
great
clarity
a
trace
of
off
white
covers
half
of
the
top
aroma
is
rice
and
a
somewhat
skunk
note
that
seems
to
dissipate
somewhat
gradually
the
taste
is
white
rice
the
mouth
is
crisp
and
yet
a
bit
thin
my
first
rice
lager
and
i
was
not
a
fan
its
water
with
a
faint
hint
of
beer
if
you
are
a
light
lager
person
or
someone
trying
to
expand
there
palate
then
i
say
go
for
it
but
for
those
who
are
looking
for
a
full
body
tasting
beer
than
i
would
tell
you
to
pass
on
this
beer
a
decent
beer
for
the
style
and
better
than
some
other
macro
rice
lagers
nothing
special
but
definitely
refreshing
in
and
inoffensive
to
enjoy
with
food
my
first
choice
at
hibachi
and
sushi
joints
very
sweet
no
bitterness
very
easy
drinking
worth
a
go
very
crappy
dont
like
it
this
is
an
average
beer
w
good
marketing
behind
it
too
much
sweetness
from
the
rice
otherwise
tastes
like
a
macro
adjunct
somewhat
fond
of
this
beer
as
it
was
always
the
beer
half
of
the
quintessential
college
sake
bomb
combination
this
beer
is
pretty
good
so
overall
would
i
recommend
it
if
you
find
it
on
special
like
i
find
it
yeah
its
different
but
not
exceptional
if
its
not
on
special
get
something
else
pretty
decent
beer
better
than
a
regular
draft
beer
overall
an
average
and
overall
unimpressive
macro
lager
that
is
assumedly
designed
to
have
low
taste
for
throwing
back
but
there
are
still
better
macro
lagers
for
the
au45

will

i
am
neutral
on
this
beer
o
i
do
like
sapporo
better
than
the
larger
american
lagers
partly
because
i
think
the
rice
provides
a
nicer
flavor
and
smoothness
than
corn
however
this
is
not
very
good
beer
for
what
it
is
it
is
alright
though
had
with
sushi
pours
a
light
yellow
with
a
lot
of
fizz
although
it
leaves
quickly
and
cleanly
the
smell
is
of
rice
and
a
little
bit
of
metal
the
taste
was
heavy
with
fermented
rice
but
gave
the
fish
time
to
shine
as
far
as
pairing
with
food
i
thought
this
beer
did
its
job
well
but
on
its
own
its
nothing
special
22
ounce
can
served
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
clear
straw
gold
color
with
a
half
inch
white
head
that
stuck
around
a
little
while
theres
also
a
decent
amount
of
lacing
not
much
to
the
aroma
the
brew
smells
like
sweet
malt
and
some
light
breadiness
i
think
the
taste
is
pretty
much
like
the
aroma
its
sweet
and
bready
but
also
has
a
bit
of
bitterness
in
the
finish
also
has
a
flavor
that
reminds
me
of
budweiser
not
sure
if
its
from
the
rice
but
theres
just
something
similar
about
it
to
me
mouthfeelbody
is
light
it
has
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
and
its
easy
enough
to
drink
for
what
it
is
its
not
a
bad
brew
at
all
id
just
have
to
be
in
a
certain
mood
to
drink
this
again
its
certainly
not
an
every
day
beer
for
me
its
worth
a
try
if
youve
never
had
it
before
the
nose
is
a
crackery
pilsner
malt
with
a
little
euro
skunkiness
the
flavor
follows
suit
with
a
lower
quality
pilsner
style
but
a
move
away
from
the
rice
centric
typical
in
japanese
beers
the
flavor
is
malty
and
crackery
despite
being
a
rice
beer
overall
its
kind
of
weak
in
flavor
but
its
very
easy
to
drink
and
delivers
beyond
most
adjunct
or
rice
beers
as
far
as
light
beers
are
concerned
sapporo
is
one
of
the
better
ones
that
ive
had
the
beer
pours
a
light
yellow
with
a
thick
head
the
taste
is
pleasant
and
refreshing
if
youre
to
try
a
light
beer
i
recommend
this
beer
over
coors
light
any
day
good
sushi
pint
of
sapporo
enough
said
overall
decent
rice
lager
that
is
quaffable
but
not
terribly
exciting
wouldnt
pass
one
up
for
free
though
not
great
but
not
awful
either
the
beer
reminded
me
of
a
better
tasting
budweiser
but
definitely
not
a
flavor
i
typically
seek
out
when
drinking
beer
however
if
you
are
drinking
very
flavorful
asian
food
and
dont
want
a
flavorful
beer
to
compete
this
beer
would
work
well
the
can
itself
is
amusingly
strong
a
decent
rice
beer
i
guess
as
far
as
rice
beers
go
color
was
yellow
with
an
average
head
which
did
not
stay
around
long
ok
malt
flavor
and
do
i
get
a
hint
of
hops
carbonation
was
good
and
finish
was
crisp
and
clean
an
ok
beer
that
i
would
definitely
need
to
have
very
cold
one
of
the
better
rice
beers
i
have
tasted
overall
i
rate
this
less
than
average
and
if
you
are
looking
for
a
good
mass
produced
japanese
beer
i
would
suggest
orion
from
okinawa
o
a
fairly
simple
and
easy
drinking
beer
nothing
offensive
about
it
good
for
what
it
is
but
its
certainly
not
at
the
top
of
my
list
in
comparison
to
other
styles
overall
would
be
refreshing
on
a
hot
summers
day
or
would
pair
well
with
a
hot
curry
but
an
unspectacular
lager
i
bought
this
ber
as
part
of
a
make
your
own
six
pack
total
drain
pour
no
flavor
what
so
ever
ive
only
said
this
about
one
other
beer
but
the
only
word
i
can
use
to
describe
it
is
yuck
i
will
never
make
the
mistake
of
putting
this
in
my
mouth
again
overall
this
is
a
great
allpurpose
lager
so
taken
for
what
it
is
and
what
it
does
with
an
asian
plate
of
food
this
is
one
of
the
better
japanese
large
brews
out
there
enjoy
sapporo
is
a
mildly
sweet
beer
with
a
slight
malt
flavor
and
no
hops
detected
the
beer
is
easy
to
drink
and
goes
down
somewhat
smooth
this
beer
would
be
enjoyable
except
for
one
key
point
the
major
flaw
of
this
beer
is
a
nasty
metallic
aftertaste
it
leaves
in
your
mouth
after
you
swallow
it
seemed
to
get
worse
and
stronger
the
more
you
drink
i
did
get
this
beer
from
a
can
but
that
aftertaste
alone
makes
me
leery
of
ever
trying
this
again
overall
a
bit
too
metallic
and
sour
not
as
sweet
as
the
japanese
version
this
can
was
brewed
in
canada
i
personally
like
this
beer
its
got
a
good
clean
taste
theres
just
enough
flavor
to
make
it
yummy
but
its
not
too
rich
or
bitter
i
find
it
to
be
great
as
a
refreshing
beer
and
i
totally
get
why
they
drink
it
with
japanese
food
its
not
too
overpowering
rice
lager
more
like
piss
lager
i
was
excited
and
expecting
a
lot
more
out
of
this
beer
and
it
let
down
if
i
had
to
compare
it
to
anything
it
would
be
an
adjunct
lager
in
fact
this
tasted
eerily
similar
to
bud
light
wont
be
trying
this
one
again
overall
i
dont
know
why
i
bought
this
i
saw
it
on
the
shelf
and
thought
what
the
hell
ive
never
tried
it
before
and
now
i
know
why
its
not
terrible
it
just
tastes
like
every
other
macrobrew
out
there
its
kind
of
fluffy
and
almost
gets
smooth
but
its
not
nearly
clean
enough
theres
a
graininess
that
interferes
crispness
is
strong
all
the
way
though
overall
very
easy
drinking
crisp
refreshing
this
is
not
close
to
being
an
enjoyable
beer
not
bad
not
good
drinkable
refreshing
adjunct
lager
with
lower
than
average
offflavors
pretty
sessionable
as
expected
but
i
wouldnt
miss
it
overall
this
is
basically
your
average
lager
but
smoother
and
thicker
feeling
definitely
a
good
option
for
when
youre
feeling
like
a
lighter
lager
but
something
that
is
just
a
little
bit
different
pours
a
lighter
golden
color
with
a
thin
white
head
that
doesnt
last
a
long
time
some
spotty
lacing
is
seen
when
sipped
lots
of
bubbles
streaming
up
form
the
bottom
and
sides
of
the
glass
all
the
way
to
the
end
the
aroma
just
of
some
sweet
maltgrains
but
that
is
about
it
the
taste
is
about
the
same
with
a
hint
of
rice
sweetness
no
bitter
aftertaste
at
all
though
would
be
great
when
eating
sushi
or
another
dish
with
the
rice
taste
from
the
beer
overall
it
was
just
average
extremely
refreshing
sweet
and
crisp
lager
very
enjoyable
advised
to
try
it
with
japanese
cuisine
particularly
with
light
meals
such
as
sushi
and
starters
such
as
gyoza
and
tempura
although
generally
quite
expensive
in
english
supermarkets
and
japanese
restaurants
smc
needs
more
carbonation
overall
an
easy
drinking
lager
that
has
a
redeeming
sweet
quality
would
pick
this
up
at
a
japanese
restaurant
with
a
meal
overall
this
a
good
everyday
beer
i
prefer
it
over
most
aal
overall
no
i
dont
really
wish
to
drink
this
again
there
is
a
high
gravity
buttery
sweetness
and
that
cooked
veggie
scent
that
makes
this
extremely
offputting
ill
stick
to
miller
or
coors
or
even
throwback
shlitz
if
i
want
an
average
type
lager
the
taste
is
where
this
beer
comes
out
short
with
a
malty
flavor
that
sours
between
sips
you
have
to
hope
that
restaurants
will
begin
to
carry
the
better
japanese
brews
hitachino
suntory
or
else
delicious
sushi
will
have
to
be
paired
with
less
than
delicious
beer
p
s
im
new
to
reviewing
but
im
learning
the
feel
is
smooth
with
moderate
carbonation
on
the
tongue
but
no
harsh
feeling
going
down
so
its
a
very
very
easy
beer
to
drink
overall
its
one
of
the
better
asianstyle
macros
ive
had
overall
this
tastes
just
like
a
bmc
but
japanese
it
met
my
expectation
and
now
im
going
to
finish
it
before
it
warms
up
and
becomes
a
sink
pour
would
not
recommend
actually
works
fairly
well
for
the
category
very
easy
drinking
and
sessionable
this
beer
is
a
aillte
above
a
pretty
good
lager
the
price
is
high
for
what
you
get
i
will
stick
to
budweiser
and
pabst
blue
ribbon
because
those
have
a
cheaper
price
tag
o
would
not
go
out
of
my
way
of
my
way
to
drink
again
but
this
seems
like
a
decent
everyday
beer
food
match
not
fit
for
potato
chips
overall
a
pretty
average
beer
id
buy
it
again
but
maybe
just
because
im
a
japanophile
i
wouldnt
buy
it
often
but
not
a
bad
beer
the
verdict
bland
but
drinkable
theres
nothing
exciting
at
all
about
this
rice
beer
imported
from
japan
but
thats
not
to
say
its
bad
its
just
a
bit
flavorless
which
is
still
preferable
from
the
skuny
cheap
macrobrews
like
keystone
or
coors
atmosphere
is
ok
lots
of
carbonation
nice
head
and
pretty
solid
lacing
nose
is
a
little
pungent
combination
of
yeast
and
wheat
flavor
of
white
bread
just
kind
of
there
nothing
distinct
about
the
flavor
or
feel
overall
this
is
an
ok
quaff
i
wont
go
out
of
my
way
for
this
beer
but
its
not
a
poor
choice
either
in
my
opinion
poured
from
the
22
oz
can
into
a
pint
glass
nice
golden
pour
with
a
1
12
finger
white
head
the
smell
is
as
you
would
expect
with
this
style
crisp
and
clean
with
a
little
malt
coming
out
taste
is
again
crisp
and
clean
and
would
really
go
with
sushi
miso
soup
pho
or
any
asian
food
fair
because
you
need
to
be
able
to
taste
the
food
this
beer
is
doing
what
its
supposed
to
do
i
like
it
for
a
japanese
lager
o
ok
people
lets
not
hate
on
premium
on
principle
it
can
be
done
wrong
but
it
can
also
be
done
right
just
like
everything
else
and
personally
i
think
this
is
one
of
the
better
ones
o
i
got
what
i
expected
from
this
beer
id
never
had
it
but
i
could
have
told
you
pretty
much
what
it
was
gonna
be
like
beforehand
boring
what
little
taste
is
there
is
foul
etc
etc
one
of
the
reasons
people
think
beer
is
nasty
didnt
even
finish
the
can
o
overall
it
was
virtually
the
same
as
its
american
counterparts
wasnt
worth
the
4
for
the
aluminum
bomber
poured
this
japanese
rice
lager
from
a
can
into
a
pint
glass
poured
a
light
straw
color
produced
a
thick
white
head
retention
was
average
and
it
did
leave
some
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
weak
containing
some
hints
of
grain
and
grassy
hops
light
in
body
a
base
of
grain
and
some
light
hops
this
is
basically
a
typical
macro
brewed
lager
says
its
from
japan
but
it
is
brewed
up
north
in
canada
overall
the
flavor
was
typical
of
a
mass
produced
lager
as
the
brew
warmed
it
went
south
quickly
poor
seems
like
a
decent
enough
beer
for
the
style
delicate
in
nature
but
smooth
and
easy
drinking
not
necessarily
my
personal
preference
for
an
everyday
beer
but
for
someone
looking
for
an
easy
going
noncomplex
beer
this
one
would
do
nicely
overall
ah
nothing
too
hot
i
would
not
frequent
this
one
this
beer
is
as
expected
rather
anonymous
it
does
quench
ones
thirst
and
makes
a
decent
lawnmower
beer
there
is
no
compelling
reason
for
me
to
have
another
this
beer
pours
clear
deep
golden
color
the
nose
is
a
much
more
subtle
aroma
that
matches
the
taste
the
beer
is
similar
to
an
adjunct
lager
at
first
it
has
a
definite
sugary
quality
and
a
sweet
caramel
flavor
the
beer
has
a
lot
of
grain
flavors
that
are
simple
but
still
taste
of
a
high
quality
mouthfeel
is
light
but
its
easy
to
drink
and
doesnt
have
any
offense
off
flavors
a
great
improvement
over
american
adjunct
lagers
this
is
clean
and
crisp
not
an
amazing
craft
beer
but
not
an
offensive
lager
either
served
on
a
chilled
glass
from
a
12
oz
bottle
this
is
a
classic
japanese
lager
when
served
it
had
a
thick
1
finger
head
its
color
was
dark
yellow
maybe
even
light
brown
the
smell
was
ricey
and
very
inviting
taste
wise
it
was
somewhat
bitter
definitely
could
taste
the
hops
and
had
a
very
good
aftertaste
its
a
very
smooth
drink
that
goes
along
well
with
japanese
cuisine
i
highly
recommend
it
and
if
you
have
the
opportunity
you
should
give
it
a
try
overall
a
beer
i
love
to
pair
up
with
philly
and
rainbow
rolls
at
the
local
sushi
place
call
me
bias
this
one
holds
a
special
place
in
my
heart
nothing
too
special
but
theres
a
nostalgic
value
i
hold
with
this
beer
would
i
buy
it
again
probably
despite
there
being
not
much
to
this
beer
it
is
light
and
refreshing
but
not
always
with
it
for
the
price
ahsushi
and
sapporo
match
made
in
heaven
pours
a
light
straw
yellow
crystal
clear
with
a
fluffy
white
soapy
head
smells
of
cooked
grains
boiled
soap
hint
of
lemon
grainy
on
the
tongue
soapy
hint
of
lemon
and
metallic
light
bodied
stale
big
adjunct
taste
smell
and
feel
also
a
big
aluminum
taste
form
the
can
very
basic
standard
beer
not
my
cup
o
tea
final
thoughts
as
far
as
macrolagers
and
imported
adjunct
lagers
go
its
not
the
best
and
its
not
the
worst
but
im
not
sure
that
any
beer
can
excel
given
the
limited
use
of
hops
and
real
malts
the
odd
shaped
can
is
about
the
only
appealing
thing
about
this
beer
pours
a
clear
golden
rod
color
with
an
offwhite
bubbly
head
scent
is
mostly
of
yeast
and
malts
smooth
easy
drinking
with
hints
of
grassy
grains
when
trying
beers
from
countries
that
arent
known
for
beer
im
always
skeptical
but
sapporo
premium
delivered
a
decent
taste
but
far
as
the
beer
spectrum
goes
this
is
average
or
just
above
average
essentially
japans
better
tasting
version
of
busch
o
so
its
not
that
interesting
to
drink
but
its
beer
and
it
doesnt
taste
bad
as
far
as
light
lagers
go
as
far
as
a
cheap
quaffable
brew
to
drink
in
the
heat
goes
its
one
of
the
best
in
my
book
certainly
still
my
favorite
asian
beer
and
ive
tried
many
overall
i
love
this
beer
i
keep
going
back
for
more
and
will
keep
going
back
for
more
because
i
thoroughly
enjoy
it
if
you
are
looking
for
a
premium
beer
at
a
good
price
and
want
to
be
able
to
drink
the
six
pack
up
without
getting
sick
of
it
then
this
is
the
beer
for
you
good
job
japan
not
a
bad
beer
heavier
on
the
grains
than
i
would
have
guessed
with
an
interesting
mouthfilling
richness
tasty
but
im
having
a
hard
time
finding
a
context
for
it
its
too
rich
and
not
dry
or
crisp
enough
to
be
really
refreshing
goes
with
rice
i
suppose
overall
good
beer
but
dont
expect
a
lot
it
is
comparable
to
other
lagers
and
honesty
its
uniqueness
is
why
i
praise
it
it
does
hit
you
quick
though
an
average
abv
this
cold
right
after
a
meal
is
greatly
appreciated
salud
o
hmmm
not
sure
what
to
say
other
than
it
does
remind
me
a
lot
like
aals
not
as
much
flavor
and
lack
of
interesting
aspects
to
it
i
think
before
i
go
any
further
id
like
to
try
some
other
jappanese
rice
lagers
overalls
it
doesnt
say
its
a
light
beer
but
it
is
a
light
beer
i
mean
i
can
see
right
through
it
im
typing
right
now
looking
through
this
beer
and
it
aint
gunna
stop
me
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
crisp
but
with
that
strange
fullness
on
the
finish
i
mentioned
earlier
the
drinkability
is
solid
overall
this
is
really
just
the
budweiser
of
japan
the
can
is
the
most
outstanding
part
about
this
beer
its
not
bad
so
im
not
going
below
a
2
its
just
thoroughly
below
average
tm
generally
inoffensive
clean
crisp
and
lightly
sweet
a
touch
of
fruit
perhaps
before
the
less
pleasant
aftertaste
distantly
bitter
but
in
a
bad
way
virtually
no
trace
of
hops
below
average
but
not
terrible
would
drink
again
especially
with
food
overall
pretty
much
the
japanese
answer
to
the
american
adjunct
lager
it
wasnt
bad
but
it
was
hardly
memorable
if
i
hadnt
taken
notes
id
never
remember
the
beer
i
would
have
thought
i
just
drank
another
american
beer
i
wouldnt
necessarily
buy
it
but
id
drink
it
again
overall
an
interesting
lager
by
sapporo
there
are
some
nice
different
flavours
in
comparison
with
its
cousin
the
american
adjunct
lager
beats
out
other
adjuncts
by
avoiding
overthetop
corn
sweetness
could
see
this
as
being
a
potential
session
candidate
o
for
a
japanese
rice
lager
its
pretty
good
light
with
no
offflavors
not
too
grainy
and
enough
hop
presence
to
balance
the
sweetness
more
body
than
i
expected
though
it
is
still
well
on
the
light
side
of
medium
carbonation
is
more
restrained
than
i
expected
too
not
the
bitter
bite
of
so
many
adjunct
lagers
a
decent
feel
and
an
aftertaste
with
some
flavor
of
citrus
from
the
hops
quite
watery
and
some
alcohol
presence
is
noted
notes
a
few
sips
from
the
can
than
poured
into
a
pilsener
glass
nice
golden
color
pured
on
my
glass
medium
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
it
has
a
barly
malt
smell
with
little
hop
presence
taste
is
nice
with
good
balance
i
enjoyed
this
beer
as
any
good
lager
it
has
good
aftertaste
and
it
is
refreshing
really
good
tastes
like
a
shitty
american
macro
wish
i
hadnt
picked
up
the
22ounce
can
ever
notice
that
beers
labeled
as
premium
are
almost
always
the
exact
opposite
sapporo
premium
pours
from
the
can
a
goldenstrawyellow
color
clear
with
a
fizzy
white
head
aroma
of
grains
corn
skunk
pretty
much
adjunct
lager
taste
is
the
same
grains
corn
malty
sweetness
and
vague
yeastiness
light
body
thin
unnecessary
undrinkable
yet
strangely
still
better
than
bud
or
old
e
i
try
to
like
this
at
sushi
places
but
this
one
doesnt
do
it
for
me
ever
last
night
i
had
a
bomber
with
some
nice
sushi
down
the
street
at
john
hollys
pours
clear
watery
looking
straw
yellow
color
with
a
small
white
head
smells
like
grains
that
do
actually
aromatically
compliment
the
sushi
but
certainly
would
not
be
appealing
in
any
other
context
flavor
is
adjunct
lagery
not
bad
and
rotten
metallic
taste
but
just
sort
of
irrelevant
really
feel
is
fine
bubbly
and
light
drinkable
if
you
are
half
dead
forget
this
one
this
is
a
much
like
asahi
it
tastes
like
a
strange
sweetened
water
but
it
is
very
light
so
it
would
work
after
a
large
meal
but
theres
nothing
particularly
good
about
it
o
very
easy
to
drink
and
actually
pretty
refreshing
pairs
really
well
with
the
delicate
flavors
of
sushi
this
is
my
normal
sushi
restaurant
beer
o
very
drinkable
and
pretty
refreshing
get
this
ever
time
ive
gone
to
ichiban
i
recommend
that
you
listen
to
this
beer
some
fm3
which
is
a
chinese
electric
duo
the
good
sound
will
up
the
weak
flavors
aso
m
light
body
nicely
carbonated
overall
its
not
a
horrible
beer
or
anything
just
not
something
id
waste
my
money
on
lol
id
drink
it
all
night
long
if
presented
for
free
the
body
is
light
with
active
carbonation
overall
no
real
reason
to
drink
this
theres
pleanty
of
other
bad
beers
that
will
cost
less
the
two
japan
beers
i
just
reviewed
left
alot
to
be
desired
overall
just
another
yellow
lager
nothing
more
feels
a
little
coarse
upfront
but
leaves
the
palate
moist
overall
its
quite
inoffensive
but
its
also
boring
and
seems
to
hardly
register
in
the
senses
nothing
exciting
to
get
worked
up
on
drink
one
and
another
and
another
and
you
will
forget
about
it
overall
not
bad
flavors
just
fairly
tasteless
big
time
drinkability
if
only
because
it
doesnt
taste
like
much
the
good
thing
is
its
nonoffensive
if
youre
looking
for
flavor
look
elsewhere
would
have
again
though
pours
a
yellowish
gold
color
with
a
thin
off
white
head
minimal
lacing
on
the
side
of
my
cbs
snifter
fairly
clear
in
appearance
the
nose
is
fairly
simple
mainly
rice
grass
and
weak
hops
not
much
to
write
home
about
here
the
taste
follows
the
same
profile
with
a
slightly
metallic
flavor
added
to
the
mix
the
feel
is
slightly
undercarbonated
fizzy
and
thin
with
a
bitter
finish
overall
a
decent
brew
for
the
style
however
i
probably
will
only
drink
this
at
japanese
steakhouses
cheers
o
its
very
alright
amongst
a
sea
of
good
and
great
beers
id
call
this
one
the
melissa
leo
of
beer
look
her
up
if
you
dont
remember
her
off
to
a
tried
and
true
beer
for
me
and
more
chicken
tenders
cheers
another
memory
of
my
youth
bites
the
dust
maybe
its
the
setting
but
i
had
held
sapporo
and
kirin
up
as
special
i
had
not
had
a
japanese
beer
in
30
years
and
now
have
concluded
it
is
a
beer
i
will
drink
sparingly
if
at
all
maybe
its
the
setting
if
i
ever
get
back
to
the
bars
in
shinjuku
i
will
happily
try
again
this
beer
is
very
light
bodied
it
washes
over
the
tongue
and
down
the
throat
without
having
time
to
leave
any
residue
and
has
a
slightly
dry
finish
not
unpleasant
at
all
taste
very
light
bodied
but
clean
and
smooth
slight
and
i
mean
a
malt
sweet
taste
not
much
taste
or
flavor
very
similar
to
american
light
beers
an
okay
beer
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
overall
seek
this
one
out
you
wont
be
sorry
o
just
not
my
cup
of
tea
if
i
want
an
adjunct
lager
ill
reach
for
something
cheaper
do
we
hold
this
against
sapporo
or
any
other
nipponese
doppelgänger
brew
no
a
great
flippin
pop
whoever
is
doing
the
brewing
crisp
clean
quite
jacked
up
war
sapporo
o
overall
this
is
pretty
good
definately
what
i
go
to
when
i
want
a
japanese
beer
thats
inexpensive
an
easy
way
to
spend
9
996
pack
overall
drinkability
neat
looking
can
but
otherwise
nothing
special
quite
drinkable
though
unoffensive
not
strong
in
flavor
but
washes
food
down
well
and
cleanses
the
palate
each
time
o
this
is
a
pleasant
beer
to
wash
down
mediocre
dollar
night
sushi
with
or
a
big
bowl
of
ramen
thats
about
as
far
as
id
take
it
there
are
certainly
better
and
cheaper
session
beers
out
there
o
easy
drinking
but
nothing
really
to
it
not
awful
nothing
offputting
but
nothing
making
me
want
to
get
it
again
rjt
genreally
fairly
fresh
and
drinkable
right
balance
of
bitterness
nothing
amazing
flavour
wise
low
alcohol
contents
offers
a
highly
drinkable
beer
i
wouldnt
drink
it
again
although
it
isnt
the
worst
thing
ive
ever
had
final
thoughts
my
first
experience
with
this
style
was
asahi
super
dry
and
this
blows
it
out
of
the
water
its
an
all
around
good
lager
with
a
unique
taste
which
is
what
i
want
and
expect
from
this
style
this
beer
is
bright
clear
yellow
with
a
thin
white
head
the
smell
is
thin
revealing
only
a
bit
of
adjunct
graininess
or
1
dimensional
grain
and
a
bit
of
spicy
noble
hop
the
taste
is
also
typical
for
an
adjunct
lager
the
grain
is
thinned
out
by
the
rice
leaving
not
much
in
the
way
of
taste
overall
but
the
body
is
nice
and
light
and
that
is
a
hallmark
of
these
light
lager
styles
drinkability
is
ok
when
the
beer
is
cold
and
youre
not
caring
about
flavor
overall
its
not
a
good
beer
but
is
very
much
the
same
as
all
light
lagers
from
this
region
although
if
all
the
beers
are
bad
i
guess
that
matching
them
is
something
you
should
want
to
strive
for
flavor
has
an
insipid
blandness
of
wet
paper
and
grain
husks
but
theres
a
moderate
hint
of
hop
bitterness
there
too
that
lingers
into
the
dry
aftertaste
crackery
pilsner
malts
clean
and
simple
a
bit
gaseous
and
thin
feeling
slightly
coarse
astringency
it
has
a
crisp
bite
overall
nothing
special
something
to
pair
with
japanese
or
panasian
cusine
on
its
own
its
a
bit
lacking
in
substance
o
not
much
going
on
but
for
being
in
the
realm
of
adjunct
lagers
this
one
has
a
pretty
clean
flavor
which
makes
for
decent
drinkability
albeit
bland
o
good
choice
at
a
sushi
place
otherwise
dont
bother
o
not
very
impressive
but
was
quite
enjoyable
with
my
meal
it
actually
worked
pretty
well
as
a
palate
cleanser
between
types
of
sushi
but
that
doesnt
say
too
much
for
the
beer
overall
i
wasnt
too
pleased
by
this
beer
this
being
my
first
rice
beer
and
first
beer
from
japan
i
was
expecting
a
different
taste
but
instead
i
got
a
familiar
american
adjunct
lager
taste
its
by
no
means
a
horrible
beer
but
for
the
most
part
i
was
disappointed
by
this
brew
clean
light
with
some
hop
flavor
no
real
point
in
purchasing
this
beer
when
you
can
get
a
craft
beer
for
the
same
price
the
beer
is
light
and
goes
down
easy
with
a
drinkable
feel
but
really
leaves
something
to
be
wanted
in
the
taste
paired
with
food
maybe
the
flavor
would
balance
out
o
bought
it
because
it
was
on
sale
at
vons
for
6
99
a
six
pack
ive
never
been
a
huge
fan
but
i
was
so
enamored
by
the
reserve
i
had
the
other
day
i
figured
id
give
this
a
try
sadly
about
as
mediocre
as
i
remember
it
try
the
sapporo
reserve
that
beer
is
about
as
good
as
ive
had
from
japan
o
great
with
asian
food
easy
to
knock
back
but
very
simple
with
little
exciting
characteristics
overall
this
is
an
okay
lager
its
probably
the
best
of
the
main
japanese
macro
brews
i
understand
why
this
got
me
into
beer
it
is
what
it
is
and
it
isnt
much
notes
meh
its
what
you
would
expect
sweet
cerealcorn
is
strongest
not
a
bad
beer
just
bland
sapporo
i
have
not
had
a
sapporo
for
over
25
years
that
long
time
ago
i
was
doing
some
field
work
in
japan
on
the
southern
island
of
kyushu
after
a
long
day
in
the
field
i
looked
forward
to
the
thermal
baths
at
the
ryukan
where
we
stayed
then
walking
over
to
the
beru
machine
dropping
in
my
yen
coins
and
getting
a
big
bottle
of
sapporo
for
the
evening
it
was
a
special
time
fast
forward
to
yesterday
when
i
was
getting
a
quick
dinner
at
tokyo
joes
the
marketing
guys
have
done
a
good
job
i
could
not
resist
the
cold
bottle
of
sapporo
on
display
as
i
placed
my
order
despite
the
plastic
cup
the
sapporo
was
a
light
straw
color
with
active
carbonation
pure
white
head
and
subtle
sweet
aroma
the
flavor
was
what
i
remember
very
clean
with
a
light
sweetness
and
faint
hop
finish
i
love
this
beer
for
the
memories
it
brings
back
to
me
despite
all
of
the
wonderful
ipas
and
hefewiezens
that
are
out
there
there
is
a
place
for
a
great
light
beer
such
as
sapporo
overall
its
a
typical
macrobrew
flavored
beer
not
terrible
and
its
cripsness
makes
it
easy
to
consume
overall
not
a
half
bad
beer
nothing
exciting
but
not
offensive
either
could
work
in
a
pinch
o
i
think
something
was
wrong
with
the
keg
maybe
it
was
old
but
i
barely
could
choke
this
one
down
and
as
i
pointed
out
i
had
already
been
drinking
so
it
was
a
bad
bad
beer
i
would
have
sent
it
back
save
the
fact
it
was
late
and
the
bartender
was
already
an
unhelpful
ass
to
me
after
i
tried
to
figure
out
what
craftlike
beers
they
had
on
tap
o
a
refreshing
thirst
quencher
but
nothing
else
the
best
thing
about
it
is
the
big
heavy
metallic
can
shaped
like
a
weizen
glass
but
i
wont
be
sucked
in
by
that
again
o
maybe
im
being
a
little
harsh
nah
not
really
this
beer
is
low
quality
and
completely
uninspiring
it
isnt
all
that
horrible
its
just
too
mediocre
for
me
to
even
give
it
an
average
rating
boring
cheers
drink
for
what
this
is
it
isnt
that
bad
alone
with
a
food
balance
it
was
a
bit
tough
to
take
down
but
as
the
food
flavors
come
through
it
makes
for
a
much
better
beer
still
slightly
below
if
notaverage
at
best
overall
not
bad
but
not
great
yet
enjoyable
o
overall
its
a
drinkable
but
not
great
beer
i
guess
its
ok
for
its
purpose
of
being
a
light
beer
that
will
in
no
way
overcome
the
flavors
of
the
food
youre
eating
if
having
it
with
sushi
as
i
did
i
would
probably
drink
it
again
as
a
mindless
beer
i
dont
have
to
think
about
and
i
would
definitely
grab
it
before
ever
thinking
of
touching
bud
or
coors
o
the
only
reason
to
buy
a
sapporo
is
the
awesome
nighindestructible
can
it
comes
in
it
loses
something
in
the
bottle
or
the
glass
this
was
pretty
good
for
the
style
not
something
i
would
drink
regularly
though
not
a
bad
beer
but
nothing
special
o
this
was
a
very
light
refreshing
beer
would
be
great
on
a
hot
day
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
who
enjoys
a
good
lager
odall
i
will
say
is
that
it
did
not
suck
as
bad
i
was
expecting
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
brew
was
the
surprising
hop
flavoring
right
off
the
bat
this
was
totally
unexpected
considering
the
bitterness
of
the
nose
and
actually
helped
to
set
things
up
nicely
the
grains
were
not
of
the
most
robust
quality
so
this
lost
the
beer
points
but
in
the
end
this
was
rather
refreshing
for
the
style
o
a
lager
with
more
bitterness
than
i
expected
its
refreshing
but
i
still
have
no
reason
to
seek
it
out
enjoyed
the
crispdryness
after
coming
in
from
yard
work
on
a
very
hot
denver
day
3
overall
pretty
tasty
although
its
more
expensive
than
massproduced
american
beers
since
its
imported
from
japan
i
will
probably
order
a
pint
of
this
with
sushi
or
pick
up
a
sixpack
before
going
to
a
house
party
taste
is
ricegrain
and
but
nothing
special
there
is
a
minor
aftertaste
unremarkable
mouthfeel
average
beer
that
is
ok
for
a
japanese
restaurant
but
not
much
else
really
not
bad
compared
to
the
light
lagers
of
today
maybe
it
was
nice
and
fresh
more
hops
than
i
imagined
and
i
got
lucky
with
it
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
pours
a
pale
straw
yellow
with
a
big
fluffy
head
that
falls
quickly
but
sticks
a
fair
amount
of
sticky
lace
on
the
sides
smells
lightly
of
grainy
malts
maybe
some
earthy
floral
hops
uninspiring
nose
puts
it
mildly
taste
is
grainy
and
slightly
sweet
hints
of
tartness
in
there
somehow
with
an
astringent
finish
crisp
carbonation
thin
body
and
a
watery
mouthfeel
well
thats
not
all
that
tasty
its
a
thin
bodied
macro
lager
with
almost
no
redeeming
qualities
one
and
done
for
this
one
beyond
the
beer
can
that
doubles
as
a
car
axle
theres
nothing
premium
here
o
i
typically
get
sapporo
when
i
want
a
beer
but
dont
want
to
spend
for
a
22
of
something
decent
its
not
terrible
by
any
means
id
drink
it
over
any
bmc
any
day
and
probably
before
a
lot
of
other
brews
too
that
said
any
store
carrying
sapporo
will
most
likely
have
something
better
or
much
better
in
stock
for
only
a
few
dollars
more
get
it
if
you
want
a
lightish
beer
without
complexity
or
if
youre
throwing
a
party
and
you
want
something
cool
to
serve
but
something
that
wont
offend
partygoers
taste
buds
o
i
suppose
this
style
of
beer
inst
up
my
alley
it
seems
factually
its
lacking
whereas
most
good
beer
should
have
some
body
andor
flavor
reminiscent
of
a
kolsch
really
just
a
much
more
refined
busch
not
a
horrible
beer
but
it
just
doesnt
do
anything
for
me
why
pay
the
premium
price
tag
for
an
average
brew
although
the
can
is
arguably
the
best
part
pours
a
super
clear
light
yellow
with
a
1
inch
white
head
that
fades
to
a
thin
film
random
thin
broken
rings
of
lace
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smells
of
rice
some
light
fruit
notes
and
a
bit
of
skunk
taste
is
ricegrain
and
some
light
fruity
flavors
there
is
an
almost
citrusy
aftertaste
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
decent
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
average
beer
that
is
a
staple
at
all
the
sushi
places
i
frequent
pretty
good
at
washing
my
sushi
down
o
decent
beer
better
beer
than
many
import
and
domestic
adjuncts
this
style
is
yet
another
on
my
quest
to
review
every
style
this
beer
pours
a
bright
and
very
clear
gold
in
color
with
a
two
finger
poofy
white
head
it
looks
refreshing
it
smells
of
pale
bready
malts
with
the
lighest
bitterness
there
isnt
much
the
flavor
consists
of
sweet
pale
malts
light
bread
and
a
lemongrass
aspect
that
i
kind
of
like
it
finishes
with
a
light
sweetness
its
hitting
the
spot
after
a
long
day
like
today
its
light
in
body
and
very
crisp
and
drinkable
its
pretty
refreshing
i
would
never
want
to
drink
this
out
of
a
bottle
but
out
of
a
can
its
not
bad
a
nice
light
beer
that
went
very
well
with
spicy
tuna
eel
sushi
i
had
at
miyake
resturant
in
ithaca
ny
the
very
light
yellow
color
and
large
head
tells
you
the
amount
of
carbonation
to
anticipate
when
drinking
this
beer
the
light
beer
aroma
matches
the
light
taste
and
the
effervescence
cleans
the
pallette
for
what
youre
eating
not
special
about
the
mouthfell
its
quite
dry
very
carbonated
and
goes
down
pretty
easy
overall
im
only
drinking
this
again
if
someone
offers
it
to
me
ill
admit
im
not
wellexperienced
with
rice
lagers
but
this
was
a
pretty
good
beer
and
certainly
a
step
above
your
average
macro
as
a
relatively
light
cleantasting
lager
with
very
little
adjunct
nastiness
sapporo
premium
fits
the
bill
i
could
see
myself
getting
this
again
but
it
would
never
be
a
staple
pours
a
light
straw
color
head
is
white

disappears

a
couple
minutes

this
one
is
a
bit
skunky
as
well
very
grainy
though
sweet
corn
taste
with
a
metallic
twang
not
too
good
but
not
terrible
light
bodied
and
medium
carbonation
make
for
a
neutral
mouth
feel
a
forgettable
beer
i
will
not
be
having
this
beer
again
anytime
soon
drinking
with
some
vietnamese
pho
had
this
tonight
at
dinner
because
it
was
the
best
they
had
light
color
not
much
head
expected
more
carbonation
than
there
was
tasted
a
little
bit
of
wheat
the
best
part
was
the
finish
and
the
surprising
taste
of
honey
at
the
end
i
enjoyed
this
part
this
would
be
better
imo
if
it
had
more
carbonation
pretty
average
beer
but
the
honey
flavor
was
something
i
enjoyed
i
would
drink
this
again
if
the
timing
was
right
i
have
liked
other
japanese
beers
as
an
occasional
quaff
but
this
one
seems
lacking
no
malt
flavor
to
speak
of
brewed
in
guelph
ontario
big
pale
simple
lager
in
the
appearance
same
in
the
smell
pretty
bland
adjunct
style
pale
taste
is
not
complex
neither
hoppy
nor
malty
nothing
too
bad
in
the
mouthfeel
goes
down
easy
not
really
a
good
value
just
an
upsold
adjunct
in
the
us
now
if
it
was
bought
for
me
id
drink
it
but
nevermore
will
i
seek
out
that
greatlooking
can
another
memory
of
my
teenage
years
gone
o
poor
mouthfeel
but
honestly
the
flavor
isnt
horrible
the
beer
is
a
very
pale
yellow
and
crystal
clear
the
head
is
thin
white
and
bubbly
smell
conists
of
grass
lemon
skunk
and
grains
taste
is
mostly
grassy
with
a
bready
aftertaste
the
liquid
is
very
light
with
some
prickly
carbonation
this
is
a
pretty
typical
light
lager
but
it
has
more
flavor
than
your
american
macros
id
put
this
just
a
couple
of
pegs
above
bmc
it
has
a
pleasant
taste
but
it
didnt
wow
me
i
think
i
will
stick
with
my
ipas
and
stouts
d
its
not
hard
to
drink
but
after
trying
it
i
would
take
a
bud
light
over
this
given
an
option
its
bland
and
plain
d
this
just
isnt
good
a
bad
beer
for
sure
overall
this
is
a
good
drinking
beer
i
will
reinvite
again
color
is
clear
light
yellow
it
has
almost
no
head
but
nice
white
lacing
smell
reminds
me
of
bud
light
and
nothing
more
memorable
than
that
the
taste
is
clean
and
smooth
surprisingly
kolshlike
not
just
another
light
beer
still
a
very
plainjane
offering
poured
a
clear
golden
color
whitish
head
ringed
up
smell
is
malty
and
a
bit
husky
taste
was
clean
and
grainy
not
a
whole
lot
of
hop
profile
mouthfeel
was
good
beer
finished
smooth
and
satisfactory
overall
id
say
this
was
a
slightly
above
average
average
beer
but
id
drink
another
a
similar
situation
overall
interesting
can
see
the
appeal
to
some
but
really
not
anything
i
would
drink
regularly
d
a
standard
lager
maybe
a
touch
better
than
standard
american
lagers
but
not
much
d
the
beer
is
very
drinkable
although
theres
nothing
interesting
about
the
taste
that
would
make
me
want
to
try
another
the
cpj
dr
its
affordable
thats
about
as
much
good
as
i
can
say
about
it
drinkability
i
would
drink
it
its
a
good
palate
cleansing
beer
it
pairs
well
with
seafood
sapporo
isnt
a
spectacular
beer
but
it
does
have
its
place
this
is
a
pretty
tasteless
beer
in
so
many
ways
super
drinkable
i
guess
because
of
the
lightness
i
could
drink
this
at
the
beach
or
something
maybe
ill
take
it
over
a
light
macro
d
actually
not
a
bad
drinking
beer
the
thing
about
lagers
of
this
style
is
that
you
know
what
youre
in
for
when
you
buy
them
and
this
one
exceeded
my
albeit
low
expectations
i
guess
the
best
thing
to
say
about
this
beer
is
that
its
not
very
offensive
drinkability
i
rated
this
to
style
if
i
was
not
take
off
5
on
each
level
at
least
that
said
this
is
a
step
up
from
most
american
adjunct
lagers
a
bit
sweeter
very
clean
and
surprisingly
decent
not
the
first
thing
i
would
reach
for
but
certainly
sessionable
on
a
hot
day
consumed
at
a
japanese
restaurant
because
well
i
was
in
a
japanese
restaurant
poured
a
clear
light
yellow
with
a
bit
of
a
white
head
did
not
see
much
lacing
or
stick
smelled
well
it
did
not
really
have
to
much
of
a
scent
maybe
some
muted
unidentifiable
grains
tasted
like
it
looked
and
smelled
tasteless
and
thin
muted
grains
drinkable
yes
but
why
would
you
want
to
d
totally
sessionable
enough
taste
to
pair
with
whatever
your
eating
and
not
clash
or
to
quaff
on
its
own
overall
i
will
drink
this
again
at
asian
restaurants
pours
a
cleanclear
golden
yellow
color
nice
carbonation
nice
fluffy
twofinger
white
head
with
lots
of
nice
sticky
lacing
left
behind
the
nose
is
malty
with
some
rice
notes
the
taste
is
slightly
sweet
malty
ricy
lightmedium
body
not
drinkable
better
than
most
american
macros
but
still
would
be
hard
to
drink
a
couple
of
these
unusual
aroma
sweet
floral
and
delicate
but
reminiscent
of
sake
i
later
find
that
this
is
a
rice
lager
not
to
be
mistaken
for
an
ab
brew
that
uses
rice
for
economical
reasons
this
japanese
lager
is
a
more
refined
and
distinct
if
delicatelyflavored
brew
some
bitterness
in
finish
probably
best
as
an
accompaniment
to
mildly
flavored
foods
basically
another
weak
light
and
watery
adjunct
lager
with
nothing
to
distance
itself
from
the
competition
except
maybe
the
neat
silver
steellooking
cans
d
for
the
most
part
there
isnt
anything
offensive
in
this
beer
it
would
be
a
highly
drinkable
beer
however
at
2
69
a
pop
for
the
22
oz
version
of
this
i
could
easily
get
something
from
sam
adams
and
at
least
then
id
feel
i
was
drinking
something
it
feels
like
it
would
be
an
easy
session
brew
but
seeing
as
how
it
has
a
craft
cost
not
an
easy
sell
d
i
have
often
paired
this
brew
with
sushi
as
its
often
the
best
beer
option
on
the
menu
at
a
japanese
restaurant
from
there
the
flavor
is
pretty
bland
some
grainy
malt
and
a
touch
of
sweetness
thats
it
the
feel
is
light
and
crisp
for
what
it
is
not
too
bad
at
all
drinks
well
enough
though
i
wouldnt
want
to
drink
very
much
of
this
and
wont
be
going
back
to
it
pours
a
pale
yellow
color
lightbodied
and
with
a
very
sparse
white
head
i
first
noticed
it
had
the
distinctive
adjunct
lager
smell
which
i
dont
enjoy
has
a
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
looks
just
like
a
bmc
lager
taste
is
average
nothing
special
i
noticed
a
slight
rice
taste
bit
of
malts
and
low
bitterness
as
most
lagers
are
would
be
highly
drinkable
i
just
dont
enjoy
it
sapporo
isnt
a
bad
beer
but
to
me
its
not
worth
paying
8
for
a
sixpack
when
i
can
get
better
beers
for
the
same
price
or
pay
5
for
a
sixpack
of
high
life
the
only
asian
beer
i
would
choose
is
tsingtao
but
only
because
i
prefer
the
taste
one
finger
head
of
foam
that
evaporated
in
seconds
leaving
a
thin
layer
of
clinging
lace
color
is
a
4
on
the
srm
beer
color
chart
smell
is
that
of
rice
go
figure
taste
is
a
mellow
blend
of
rice
and
light
hop
flavor
much
like
soda
water
feeling
in
my
mouth
not
a
bad
flavor
but
not
enough
flavor
i
will
not
buy
another
but
will
not
be
rude
if
i
am
offered
one
at
a
gathering
d
well
not
a
huge
surprise
here
its
a
rice
lager
nuff
said
very
clear
looking
liquid
taste
almost
exactly
the
same
as
coor
light
which
i
happen
upon
as
my
first
light
beer
nothing
bad
about
it
at
first
but
i
wanted
something
different
after
awhile
tap
the
rockies
i
could
settle
for
this
beer
as
a
first
time
beer
drinker
this
jap
beer
would
attract
the
newbies
to
lockful
tasty
strong
coffee
types
of
brewery
i
think
but
maybe
after
a
year
or
so
of
this
stuff
and
as
a
result
of
drinking
this
stuff
i
would
not
be
hesitant
to
try
beers
in
japan
compare
to
steele
reserve
which
i
also
can
down
like
a
champ
haha
d
i
dont
know
much
about
japanese
beers
but
if
im
eating
sushi
this
is
what
im
drinking
not
a
whole
lot
of
head
but
more
so
than
most
asian
beers
pours
a
traditional
yellow
the
color
is
the
same
as
every
other
asian
beer
smells
and
tastes
like
grass
light
hops
not
a
lot
of
grain
or
wheat
happening
i
enjoyed
it
but
its
not
a
favorite
ill
drink
it
again
though
had
this
at
jade
in
orlando
not
much
to
order
so
i
tried
this
one
poured
a
classic
yellow
color
with
a
fresh
head
crystal
clear
smell
was
grass
and
lemon
and
biscuit
taste
was
grass
and
slight
hop
with
lemon
and
hay
with
some
malt
mouth
feel
was
crisp
and
and
carbonated
just
not
alot
of
flavor
i
will
say
that
i
drank
it
very
fast
as
it
went
well
with
the
salty
spicy
oriental
food
not
a
bad
lager
it
is
what
it
is
so
i
guess
that
its
a
good
rep
of
the
style
i
had
this
beer
while
at
a
sushi
place
it
poured
a
yellow
color
almost
straw
like
the
head
was
white
and
stayed
with
the
beer
for
awhile
it
smells
almost
grassy
or
hay
like
like
a
light
lager
that
is
foreign
the
taste
is
sweeter
than
most
lagers
i
have
had
from
the
states
mouthfeel
is
light
and
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
sapporo
premium
beer
has
a
light
straw
colour
and
a
head
that
fades
quickly
into
light
lacing
the
smell
is
grainy
with
some
slight
hoppiness
the
flavour
starts
with
some
sourness
to
begin
with
and
finishes
with
graininess
the
mouthfeel
is
watery
with
a
little
carbonation
this
beer
pours
a
light
golden
color
with
very
little
head
to
talk
about
the
smell
is
lots
of
puffed
rice
and
general
stank
but
its
not
horrifying
to
the
nose
the
taste
is
of
sweet
rice
and
its
an
odd
flavor
more
akin
to
a
sake
than
a
beer
but
its
not
bad
this
beer
is
watery
and
bitter
on
the
palate
and
isnt
really
that
good
to
drink
if
you
like
sake
i
say
go
for
it
if
you
dont
then
dear
god
dont
go
anywhere
near
this
beer
cant
say
id
drink
much
of
this
like
i
said
i
am
only
drinking
this
to
get
it
out
of
my
fridge
overall
not
a
terrible
beer
probably
my
second
favorite
japanese
beer
after
yebisu
on
tap
i
really
like
this
beer
decently
bittered
and
distinctly
pilsnermalty
clean
and
crisp
this
beer
is
very
refreshing
and
is
a
cut
above
the
usual
run
of
the
mill
light
lagers
its
far
far
far
better
than
the
canned
version
which
is
thoroughly
mediocre
its
not
that
this
beer
tastes
bad
it
just
tastes
like
nothing
at
all
for
a
cheap
thirst
quencher
perhaps
but
not
much
else
d
not
really
that
good
i
guess
it
was
more
interesting
than
a
water
maybe
not
a
water
with
lemon
though
cheers
drinkability
could
easily
down
a
few
during
a
football
game
but
why
bother
just
get
case
of
coors
light
and
save
your
money
d
easy
to
drink
i
probably
wouldnt
buy
this
beer
just
to
sit
down
and
have
a
few
but
when
i
paired
it
with
sushi
i
can
enjoy
it
for
what
it
is
d
if
its
ice
cold
this
ones
not
bad
for
what
it
is
as
it
warms
up
however
some
off
flavors
and
scents
show
up
and
make
it
a
bit
of
a
chore
to
drink
my
advice
if
someone
gives
you
this
as
a
gift
thats
how
i
got
the
bottle
keep
it
in
the
fridge
mow
the
lawn
on
a
hot
day
and
then
put
it
in
the
freezer
for
10
minutes
or
so
pour
into
a
pilsner
glass
and
chug
really
the
only
nice
thing
about
this
beer
is
the
cool
uniquely
shaped
and
classy
can
this
beer
has
been
a
saving
grace
at
many
a
sushi
restaurant
in
comparison
with
the
other
usual
offerings
moderately
crisp
with
a
rather
full
malt
middle
and
a
slightly
astringent
finish
does
a
nice
job
of
cutting
wasabi
heat
and
fatty
tuna
as
an
independent
beverage
however
it
has
little
by
which
to
distinguish
itself
other
than
a
really
cool
can
while
certainly
drinkable
i
wouldnt
want
any
more
than
one
of
these
big
cans
i
guess
it
goes
well
enough
with
the
asian
food
youre
likely
to
be
consuming
it
along
with
since
its
unfortunately
the
beerlist
highlight
of
a
good
many
such
restaurants
overall
this
beer
dissapoints
as
it
could
be
so
much
more
ricebased
lagers
are
an
unfortunate
result
of
lack
of
resources
and
never
seem
to
quite
match
the
pure
barleymalt
offerings
in
quality
i
find
it
can
also
vary
in
quality
from
can
to
can
which
did
not
seem
to
be
a
problem
in
the
nottoodistant
past
straw
gold
in
colour
pillowy
white
head
shows
decent
retention
and
leaves
the
occasional
patch
of
lace
light
grain
and
grass
aroma
grainy
musty
flavour
hopping
is
very
muted
and
indistinct
giving
it
a
the
barest
touch
of
bitterness
appropriately
light
for
the
style
but
i
find
the
carbonation
prickly
and
aggressive
this
is
actually
pretty
palate
cleansing
stuff
for
what
its
worth
if
given
a
choice
between
the
two
i
would
rather
drink
asahi
super
dry
at
a
sushi
joint
its
just
as
palate
cleansing
and
mild
but
lacks
the
unpleasant
mustiness
of
the
sapporo
its
got
a
golden
color
heavy
carbonation
and
i
believe
this
styles
called
pilsner
a
bit
sweeter
than
bud
but
nothing
special
its
good
to
know
what
it
tastes
like
though
ive
been
able
to
recommend
this
beer
to
my
father
when
going
to
japanese
restaurants
since
hes
strictly
a
bud
man
this
is
basically
a
generic
american
beer
with
a
bit
more
quality
and
crispness
tastes
like
grain
and
alcohol
nothing
special
but
they
get
a
for
presentation
the
giant
can
is
pretty
cool
i
enjoy
this
beer
when
at
asian
restaurants
this
or
an
asahi
its
good
to
quench
your
thirst
when
youre
parched
if
youre
looking
for
a
beer
to
sit
and
enjoy
you
better
look
elsewhere
because
this
is
one
beer
that
will
disappoint
in
the
flavor
dept
this
beer
is
the
most
refreshing
of
beers
everything
a
light
beer
should
be
but
isnt
drink
i
honestly
dont
see
what
all
the
fuss
is
about
with
this
beer
its
fine
but
id
much
rather
have
a
lower
priced
tsingtao
thinner
bodied
but
appropriately
light
helps
in
the
drinkability
and
it
needs
it
a
food
washer
at
best
not
even
really
that
great
for
hot
weather
beer
a
lightly
flavored
beverage
that
wont
get
in
the
way
of
food
offers
little
gives
little
eh
not
horrid
or
offflavored
just
lacking
d
full
marks
here
this
is
very
easy
to
drink
as
it
is
flavorfull
enough
to
want
more
doesnt
scrub
the
palate
with
bubbles
and
is
a
clean
crisp
beer
to
enjoy
on
the
deck
as
i
did
for
this
review
anyone
who
like
bmc
should
try
this
and
ill
bet
will
find
it
much
more
enjoyable
d
typical
lager
sessionability
if
youre
into
that
kinda
thing
not
exciting
enough
to
want
another
drinkability
as
i
said
its
not
awful
and
its
light
and
refreshing
ill
call
this
fairly
drinkable
d
i
could
sip
these
back
all
day
nb
this
was
brewed
in
japan
never
ever
ever
buy
a
japanese
beer
brewed
in
north
america
ive
never
had
a
good
one
d
not
bad
a
light
beer
to
drink
very
cold
when
its
very
hot
i
poured
this
from
a
22oz
can
into
a
heavy
glass
mug
i
had
in
the
freezer
color
and
smell
nothing
special
the
head
was
massive
but
dies
quickly
freezing
the
glass
seems
to
do
this
for
most
beers
the
taste
is
nothing
special
but
it
does
taste
good
this
is
a
minor
cut
above
most
macro
lagers
there
is
a
fullness
to
the
mouthfeel
and
up
front
nothing
bad
can
be
said
about
the
flavor
but
it
does
get
better
when
and
after
you
swallow
it
expanding
into
a
pleasant
richness
going
down
with
flavors
of
slight
orange
rind
and
a
light
honeyish
sweetness
with
hint
of
spiciness
or
kick
its
not
a
world
class
or
exceptional
beer
in
any
way
but
it
is
a
good
solidly
built
beer
that
does
not
let
me
down
not
the
worst
but
certainly
not
the
best
meh
not
too
bad
for
a
macro
ive
had
much
worse
drinkability
nice
easy
drinking
lager
but
nothing
special
although
in
essence
japanese
rice
lagers
are
designed
from
an
industrial
standpoint
to
be
cheaper
and
more
efficient
beers
to
make
the
better
ones
do
still
make
fairly
decent
quaffs
sapporo
would
not
be
my
first
choice
for
the
style
much
less
for
a
lager
in
general
but
it
fairs
better
than
many
of
its
countrys
other
less
agreeable
examples
d
on
its
own
its
good
enough
but
with
food
it
shines
sapporo
premium
must
be
among
the
bestknown
and
best
perhaps
versions
of
a
style
that
is
muchmaligned
for
its
use
of
adjuncts
and
such
no
worries
its
still
superdrinkable
crystal
clear
deep
yellow
in
colour
fine
white
bubbles
formed
a
thin
coat
on
top
of
the
beer
and
left
a
bit
of
clingy
lace
at
the
top
of
the
glass
moderate
head
retention
mild
aroma
crackery
grain
a
bit
of
marshmallow
light
floral
and
fruit
character
very
clean
low
bitterness
mild
grain
and
light
fruity
flavours
finished
very
dry
with
a
hint
of
spicy
hops
light
bodied
moderate
carbonation
crisp
and
clean
very
easy
drinking
without
any
off
flavours
quite
refreshing
a
solid
example
of
the
style
d
a
cold
one
or
three
on
a
hot
day
would
be
pretty
good
overall
sapporo
is
the
second
asian
beer
ive
tried
and
i
definitely
notice
some
similarities
to
tsingtao
a
decent
smooth
beer
that
goes
wonderfully
with
sushi
overall
id
conclude
this
beer
isnt
all
that
great
i
enjoy
having
sapporo
with
sushi
but
on
its
own
it
is
a
fairly
mediocre
beer
there
are
better
beers
out
there
for
your
dollar
bought
this
brew
as
i
havnt
had
it
for
ages
anyway
it
pours
a
pale
straw
hue
with
decent
carbonation
that
leaves
a
frothy
two
finger
head
and
some
clingy
lacing
but
to
be
honest
it
looks
very
macroand
it
has
a
pretty
average
smell
too
with
feint
aromas
of
ricegrain
and
some
grassy
hops
and
there
is
not
much
love
with
this
one
on
smell
and
taste
is
pretty
much
the
same
its
pretty
easy
to
down
but
so
is
water
and
its
lacklustre
feint
tastes
of
ricegrain
and
some
grassy
hops
dont
really
cut
it
for
me
and
to
be
honest
i
remember
this
brew
being
a
little
better
but
maybe
i
was
wrong
and
its
definately
dissapointing
i
wont
be
revisiting
this
brew
anytime
soon
after
this
one
thats
for
sure
d
its
not
interesting
but
the
low
alcohol
means
that
you
could
easily
put
away
a
six
pack
if
you
really
wanted
to
the
body
is
crisp
refreshing
and
smooth
on
the
finish
great
for
a
lager
mild
grainy
flavors
rice
i
guess
some
buttery
bread
and
a
kiss
of
sweetness
on
the
backend
its
not
too
different
from
the
cheap
american
lagers
but
i
found
it
just
a
tad
more
flavorful
refreshing
i
could
quench
my
thirst
after
a
day
in
the
yard
with
this
offering
not
bad
overall
it
was
nice
to
try
something
light
and
crisp
at
lunch
and
something
a
little
different
that
did
accompany
my
mongolian
beef
lunch
dish
nicely
the
feel
is
light
and
carb
is
at
a
even
pace
not
bitey
easy
drinking
here
it
comes
and
goes
just
as
quick
in
and
out
no
lingering
flavors
here
i
would
not
call
this
refreshing
more
like
quenching
this
is
not
bad
beer
its
not
superior
either
it
is
just
what
it
is
simple
beer
value
slightly
overpriced
although
i
only
paid
1
29
for
a
single
bottle
so
i
cant
complain
here
d
easy
drinking
forementioned
rice
quality
is
a
major
factoralso
notice
this
quality
in
bud
though
in
that
case
its
the
only
quality
d
like
many
lagers
this
beer
shines
in
its
ability
to
be
downed
very
easy
to
drink
and
not
unpleasant
at
all
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
it
but
its
better
than
a
lot
of
other
macros
overall
it
is
refreshing
and
thats
what
counts
better
than
bud
coors
etc
by
a
good
long
shot
miller
might
beat
it
d
nice
drinkability
this
is
my
first
rice
lager
its
very
light
not
really
packing
a
whole
lot
of
flavor
here
but
it
went
down
very
easily
i
paired
this
with
some
tasty
lo
mein
it
complimented
it
well
drinkability
drinkablility
is
above
average
i
think
it
would
go
great
with
any
asian
cuisine
well
i
think
the
can
helps
the
appearance
a
bit
but
its
just
a
strawpale
yellow
beer
with
a
small
fizzy
white
head
with
no
retention
or
lacing
aroma
was
extremely
faint
mostly
of
pale
malts
maybe
even
a
touch
of
honey
at
the
end
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
not
much
there
light
bodied
high
carbonation
it
just
feels
like
carbonated
water
as
for
the
drinkability
well
i
finished
the
can
but
would
definitely
not
get
another
aroma
and
taste
are
pretty
typical
for
this
style
malty
and
macro
tasting
lacking
crispness
with
a
slight
fruity
potting
soil
nose
eh
not
worth
it
might
as
well
have
a
bud
pours
a
clear
pale
goldyellow
hue
scarcely
any
head
smells
of
grainy
adjunct
sweetness
with
some
skunk
mixed
in
for
good
measure
just
a
grassy
grainy
metallic
taste
conglomeration
carbonation
is
pretty
biting
which
actually
helps
this
beer
go
down
easier
for
me
its
not
horrible
but
id
never
belly
up
and
order
one
on
purpose
straw
yellow
color
with
a
large
foamy
head
which
fades
away
quickly
the
smell
is
somewhat
generic
some
hops
and
grain
nothing
special
the
taste
is
also
nothing
special
hops
and
grain
and
an
unpleasant
bitterness
also
has
a
metallic
aftertaste
this
is
a
beer
which
should
only
be
consumed
cold
letting
this
beer
warm
does
not
flatter
it
overall
not
impressive
dnot
too
bad
dont
smell
it
though
basically
a
japanese
adjunct
that
can
go
down
the
throat
i
love
it
really
good
beer
the
appearance
is
golden
with
a
lace
that
sticks
to
the
glass
the
smell
is
light
but
nice
with
a
smell
of
grain
and
a
light
hint
of
hops
the
taste
is
great
with
noticable
hop
taste
the
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
helps
it
finish
to
a
nice
clean
crisp
refreshing
beer
crisp
and
dry
with
a
touch
of
spicy
hop
flavor
and
malty
graininess
quite
refreshing
with
more
character
than
american
adjunct
lagers
which
keeps
it
interesting
enough
to
have
several
not
much
else
to
be
said
its
great
for
washing
down
greasy
fried
rice
and
is
a
nice
counterpoint
to
the
delicate
flavors
of
sushi
the
beer
is
balanced
which
is
good
the
taste
of
adjunct
not
as
good
the
body
and
drinkability
were
what
youd
expect
from
a
light
lager
of
this
style
overall
not
a
bad
beer
i
might
not
seek
it
out
again
but
i
wouldnt
turn
one
down
either
happy
one
year
anniversary
to
me
i
actually
just
went
to
smell
this
again
and
accidentally
sniffed
it
into
my
nose
omg
the
rice
smell
is
now
super
apparent
and
lingering
haha
md
easy
and
refreshing
to
drink
but
not
overly
enjoyable
finishes
smooth
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
small
glass
pale
yellow
little
head
smell
was
somewhat
faint
but
what
was
there
was
some
hops
and
some
light
grain
i
e
rice
taste
was
okay
nothing
special
just
light
floral
hops
and
rice
a
bit
watery
overall
went
ok
with
the
korean
food
i
had
but
i
wouldnt
be
going
out
to
get
a
pack
of
this
ever
look
yellow
bright
fat
foamy
head
with
extended
duration
looks
good
but
its
very
difficult
to
open
the
can
smell
fresh
sweet
malt
corn
and
possibly
rice
taste
plenty
of
rice
and
grains
mouthfeel
dry
medium
bitterness
with
a
sour
finish
not
offensive
drinkability
i
liked
with
my
meal
but
i
had
some
trouble
opening
the
can
d
would
likely
never
purchase
but
it
does
pretty
well
cutting
through
wasabi
and
eel
sauce
from
a
maki
roll
plate
an
average
tasting
lager
and
the
rice
only
adds
dryness
and
cleansing
qualities
to
the
brew
and
offers
nothing
in
the
way
of
taste
for
me
stopped
at
the
market
for
sushi
and
stir
fry
so
i
saw
this
sapporo
and
said
hey
this
has
to
go
with
it
so
lets
give
it
a
whirl
for
starters
the
can
is
a
good
start
towards
appearance
it
is
unique
and
sensually
shaped
and
a
bright
silver
popping
the
top
this
brew
smells
like
a
typical
adjunct
but
more
so
even
so
being
made
from
rice
thats
spot
on
it
pours
to
a
bright
yellow
with
a
nice
foamy
head
that
holds
up
well
taste
is
very
neutral
niether
sweet
nor
bitter
good
body
and
not
watery
at
all
but
really
no
backbone
kind
of
a
run
of
the
mill
adjunct
flavor
this
goes
good
with
the
food
though
but
without
a
doubt
not
at
all
a
standout
it
would
pair
up
good
with
a
spicy
thai
food
12
oz
brown
bottle
to
glass
pours
a
light
golden
looks
like
bud
smell
is
a
typical
light
lager
fairly
fresh
though
a
bit
sweeter
than
typical
bmc
but
thats
the
closest
reference
i
can
think
of
actually
not
bad
for
the
style
good
drinkability
but
wouldnt
be
able
to
pick
this
out
of
a
lineup
of
macros
d
this
complements
the
sushi
i
was
eating
well
as
it
did
not
overpower
the
delicate
balance
of
flavors
characteristic
of
japanese
food
however
as
a
standalone
beer
it
is
a
fairly
mainstream
lager
and
not
impressive
at
all
cheers
i
am
impressed
with
the
bitterness
given
how
light
this
beer
is
better
than
a
bmc
but
all
around
pretty
bad
beer
d
id
rank
this
one
a
step
above
most
american
macros
which
are
generally
your
alternatives
at
restaurants
where
youll
find
sapporo
its
bland
but
unlike
the
alternatives
i
find
it
completely
inoffensive
and
is
not
an
unpleasant
way
to
wash
down
vietnamese
noodles
no
mouthfeel
drinkable
yeah
so
long
as
you
arent
opposed
to
no
taste
overall
maybe
this
could
be
a
beer
for
your
guests
who
swear
by
the
beers
that
they
see
on
commercials
during
football
games
perhaps
served
with
japanese
cuisine
actually
just
save
some
money
and
buy
an
american
macro
lager
or
better
still
offer
something
with
flavor
and
lets
your
friends
bring
the
30packs
if
theyd
like
d
i
was
very
pleasantly
surprised
at
the
depth
of
flavor
i
was
expecting
a
bmc
but
this
beer
has
a
lot
more
character
i
poured
this
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
45
degrees
the
beer
was
yellow
pretty
normal
looking
with
a
thin
unimpressive
head
the
smell
was
slightly
bready
slightly
skunky
but
not
too
bad
the
head
was
gone
fasr
the
beer
did
have
a
clean
taste
though
and
was
quite
good
i
will
buyy
again
d
easily
drinkable
like
water
almost
22oz
can
will
be
bought
again
drink
is
not
all
that
bad
it
seems
to
be
similar
to
our
budweiser
or
miller
lite
but
is
a
little
bit
tastier
than
those
imo
poured
into
a
tumbler
it
produces
a
small
head
that
dissipates
quickly
and
leaves
little
lacing
the
appearance
is
straw
yellow
and
clear
the
aroma
is
slightly
hopped
with
some
sweet
grains
the
taste
is
slight
and
slightly
sweet
with
little
or
no
bitterness
the
feel
is
light
bodied
with
a
clean
finish
a
very
drinkable
beer
beer
is
slightly
sweet
low
bodied
no
aftertaste
some
cereal
tastes
disconnected
palate
flavors
not
enough
bitterness
drinkability
is
like
water
mouthfeel
is
fine
not
much
to
say
but
its
fine
to
mediocre
d
nothing
offensive
or
interesting
drinkability
pretty
bland
tastes
like
a
weaker
version
of
an
american
macro
lager
i
would
only
drink
this
with
japanese
food
overall
this
is
the
first
rice
lager
i
have
had
so
i
am
not
sure
what
the
style
is
supposed
to
be
like
but
from
my
reading
it
seems
similar
to
adjunct
lagers
and
euro
pale
lagers
so
i
reviewed
it
with
both
of
those
styles
in
the
back
of
my
mind
d
not
a
bad
adjunct
lager
there
is
a
fairly
strong
malt
profile
and
it
even
has
some
malt
richness
and
herbal
hops
that
are
reminiscent
of
a
real
pilsner
the
finish
is
not
as
smooth
as
it
could
be
but
i
let
this
warm
up
a
bit
and
if
it
were
consumed
at
the
near
freezing
temperatures
the
brewers
intended
it
would
probably
seem
pretty
clean
pretty
good
for
what
it
is
and
much
more
enjoyable
that
most
industrial
light
lagers
overall
this
beer
does
not
impress
to
the
standard
of
a
premium
beer
as
labeled
overall
not
a
beer
id
go
out
of
my
way
to
drink
on
a
regular
basis
but
an
excellent
choice
to
pair
up
with
teriyaki
or
sushi
which
this
beer
goes
quite
well
with
also
a
definite
step
up
from
bmc
stuff
d
this
is
of
course
a
very
drinkable
beer
that
is
what
it
is
designed
to
be
im
not
really
a
fan
of
the
style
nor
a
huge
fan
of
the
beer
in
particular
but
its
okay
to
drink
one
or
two
with
a
japanese
meal
a
pretty
decent
lawnmower
beer
nothing
offensive
but
also
nothing
really
notable
sapporo
premium
pours
pale
pale
yellow
thanks
to
the
rice
in
a
pilsner
glass
very
semidry
and
light
easy
to
drink
with
pretty
much
anything
from
chips
to
sushi
to
cheese
burgers
the
usual
default
beer
at
most
japanese
restuarants
no
harm
no
foul
with
this
beer
for
all
palates
d
very
high
i
dont
know
where
itll
get
you
but
its
just
like
drinking
water
low
carbonation
and
everything
drinkability
ok
probably
wouldnt
drink
it
again
wont
buy
it
again
would
possibly
drink
it
at
a
japanese
restaurant
but
thats
it
this
beer
is
highly
drinkable
a
good
alternative
to
macro
lagers
not
too
bad
marked
down
for
the
canadian
thing
though
pours
a
totally
transparent
diluted
yellow
with
a
clean
white
pillowy
head
that
dissipates
quickly
and
leaves
a
bit
of
lace
behind
smells
like
a
lager
end
of
story
some
sweetness
on
the
nose
coupled
with
rice
notes
tastes
the
same
a
sweet
aftertaste
that
lingers
im
kind
of
begging
for
some
sushi
right
now
why
would
i
buy
this
for
home
cant
figure
it
out
mouthfeel
is
solid
though
drinkability
is
great
as
well
i
couldnt
dream
up
a
better
beer
aside
from
asahi
which
i
prefer
to
drink
with
a
great
japanese
meal
drinkability
is
great
a
light
lager
with
a
solid
freshness
and
a
profile
that
is
pleasant
on
the
palate
for
a
brew
this
light
the
profile
is
pretty
well
put
together
though
the
rice
added
does
apparently
little
to
the
finished
product
otherwise
this
is
a
solid
light
lager
cheers
pours
a
pale
straw
color
with
a
near
two
finger

gives

to
some
decent
lacing
the
smell
is
of
a
corn
and
rice
backbone
with
a
little
hint
of
some
sweet
malt
the
overall
taste
is
of
rice
there
is
a
bitter
bite
but
it
is
not
from
hops
its
a
crisp
bite
the
mouthfeel
is

moderate
carbonation
and
is
very
crisp
overall
you
could
drink
these
all
day
but
with
there
just
not
being
a
lot
of
taste
or
complexity
you
might
not
want
to
d
lawnmower
beer
not
horrible
have
had
worse
prefer
not
to
drink
it
but
alright
for
what
it
is
it
cannot
be
recommended
however
if
nothing
else
is
available
then
its
drinkable
a
pale
yellow
pour
with
almost
no
head
at
all
very
little
carbonation
aroma
of
euro
hops
and
adjuncts
corn
or
rice
slight
grain
note
flavor
is
lightly
hoppy
with
very
little
else
malt
is
nonexistant
watery
mouthfeel
thin
body
crisp
and
refreshing
sessionable
i
guess
nothing
special
at
all
d
depending
on
the
day
this
could
be
one
of
the
most
drinkable
beers
to
me
i
have
a
soft
spot
in
my
heart
for
this
as
it
was
one
of
my
early
faves
but
it
is
still
highly
drinkable
and
fits
the
style
imo
the
can
makes
for
more
of
a
conversation
than
the
actual
beer
if
your
eating
sushi
and
looking
to
stay
local
with
your
choice
of
beer
i
could
understand
drinking
this
beyond
that
i
wouldnt
seek
this
stuff
out
drinkability
is
good
because
it
has
a
lower
abv
and
a
crisp
character
it
could
make
a
good
session
beer
if
you
like
your
beer
on
the
sweet
malt
side
honestly
i
expected
something
so
much
more
exciting
from
a
beer
that
is
brewed
since
1876
on
the
other
side
of
the
world
im
sure
the
land
of
the
rising
sun
has
much
better
to
offer
than
this
below
average
brew
if
you
are
looking
for
a
unique
asian
flavor
look
elsewhere
d
average
comparable
to
american
light
beers
at
best
d
if
these
didnt
cost
so
much
i
would
buy
them
all
the
time
the
beer
poured
a
light
clear
yellow
with
a
small
head
that
didnt
last
long
and
some
visible
carbonation
the
smell
was
sweet
malt
with
just
a
touch
of
hops
whatever
hops
were
in
the
smell
didnt
seem
to
translate
well
into
the
taste
and
it
was
basically
all
sweet
malt
that
lingered
a
bit
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
watery
but
with
some
good
carbonation
to
keep
it
crisp
and
it
is
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
nothing
outstanding
but
you
could
get
a
worse
beer
to
go
with
your
sushi
my
two
biggest
factors
in
drinkability
and
buying
this
beer
again
are
how
the
beer
pairs
with
food
and
bang
for
the
buck
this
beer
went
great
with
the
asian
food
i
ate
but
at
the
same
time
just
about
any
runofthemill
lager
would
have
done
almost
as
well
i
think
i
paid
3
50
which
i
think
is
a
standard
price
for
the
beer
what
a
ripoff
id
much
rather
get
a
12pack
of
my
local
full
sail
session
for
9
try
this
if
youre
curious
but
i
just
cant
give
it
a
good
recommendation
because
of
the
price
the
appearance
is
good
enough
i
actually
find
that
rice
lagers
tend
to
look
quite
appetising
and
its
shiny
gold
body
and
foamy
white
head
score
good
marks
and
bonus
point
for
the
rings
of
lace
from
here
on
in
were
all
generic
and
you
may
as
well
be
drinking
budweiser
no
scrub
that
this
isnt
as
bad
as
that
rice
lager
and
at
least
it
has
a
redeeming
crispness
to
its
finish
aroma
and
taste
is
all
pale
malts
and
metallic
hops
which
abruptly
disappear
moments
after
sipping
the
body
is
lagerish
light
and
perhaps
overcarbonated
but
really
were
par
for
the
course
drinkability
is
okay
heck
at
the
wedding
we
attended
i
drank
way
more
of
this
than
i
thought
possible
still
its
no
match
for
a
good
shochu
sake
or
most
other
beers
for
that
matter
i
dont
know
why
people
feel
the
need
to
hate
on
a
perfectly
tasty
and
drinkable
beer
just
because
its
easy
going
doesnt
make
it
bad
if
your
looking
for
a
good
beer
to
take
away
the
heat
from
a
spicy
dish
or
just
something
new
try
sapporo
overall
its
fine
for
drinkability
because
there
isnt
much
to
it
but
its
just
pretty
boring
the
taste
profile
is
pretty
barren
and
im
not
impressed
d
id
never
pay
for
this
it
was
a
good
bbq
beer
to
wash
down
what
i
was
eating
but
im
never
going
to
seek
it
out
on
my
own
easy
washed
down
the
food
just
fine
not
as
good
as
baltika
light
as
far
as
my
go
to
for
cleanlinessbeing
refreshing
goes
though
d
easy
drinker
simply
because
it
doesnt
taste
like
anything
a
little
too
much
on
the
sweet
side
for
me
to
really
enjoy
i
dont
think
ill
be
getting
this
again
drinkability
never
again
poured
from
a
brown
bottle
into
a
weizen
glass
has
a
golden
color
with
a
small
head
slight
grainy
aroma
not
much
flavor
in
this
beer
taste
is
weak
and
finishes
very
dry
a
fairly
drinkable
beer
o
k
in
a
pinch
but
overall
this
is
a
very
mediocore
beer
i
dont
know
why
this
beer
gets
a
c
rating
because
in
a
blind
taste
test
with
some
pils
i
think
this
beer
would
stand
stong
its
decently
refreshing
fairly
bland
but
theres
more
there
than
a
standard
north
american
adjunct
lager
nice
weighty
can
i
always
thought
sapporo
was
the
most
distinctive
of
the
big
japanese
3
im
not
sure
if
it
has
more
rice
in
it
but
it
tastes
that
way
at
any
rate
poured
from
the
signature
giant
silver
can
its
a
light
straw
with
a
giant
foam
head
that
starts
to
fade
fast
but
then
sticks
around
for
a
few
minutes
leaving
a
lot
on
the
sides
not
much
smell
to
speak
of
somewhat
distinctive
taste
as
i
mentioned
earlier
although
its
clearly
a
light
colored
lager
no
new
ground
broken
it
goes
down
very
smooth
and
has
a
bit
of
an
aftertaste
that
sticks
around
for
a
while
could
very
very
dangerous
in
those
big
cans
that
seems
to
appear
so
quickly
at
karaoke
bars
but
i
digress
sapporos
been
in
my
lager
rotation
for
a
while
and
is
probably
going
to
stay
there
a
fairly
refreshing
quotidian
lager
if
you
turn
your
attention
to
the
burgeoning
spring
sunshine
on
this
fine
peoplewatching
patio
and
not
to
the
cracks
in
the
foundation
of
this
offering
not
overly
flavorful
but
i
can
see
how
it
will
get
the
local
crowds
all
fired
up
on
pint
specials
and
other
canadian
macro
swill
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
but
i
dont
think
i
would
drinkability
im
impressed
this
is
a
great
smooth
drinking
lager
this
beer
pours
a
clear
straw
yellow
color
thin
white
lace
for
a
head
merely
a
coating
on
top
of
the
beer
no
lacing
to
speak
of
nose
is
of
grains
and
some
grassiness
its
really
a
pretty
neutral
nose
the
beer
is
clean
tasting
there
is
that
jumps
out
or
dominates
some
sweet
grainy
flavors
grass
and
rice
minimal
hop
presence
on
the
finish
highly
carbonated
very
light
bodied
its
very
drinkable
but
there
are
betters
out
there
d
not
very
impressive
but
somewhat
decent
sapporo
is
a
good
compliment
to
japanese
food
but
is
a
questionable
treat
on
its
own
i
had
this
beer
in
a
tampa
restaurant
called
ciccios
id
go
back
to
the
restaurant
anytime
not
sure
about
having
this
beer
again
not
that
it
was
bad
it
just
reminded
me
too
much
of
a
macro
lager
the
beer
was
a
pale
yellow
color
with
a
thin
white
head
a
little
malt
in
the
aroma
and
a
little
malt
in
the
taste
also
a
bit
of
hops
a
very
little
bit
it
drank
easily
and
went
well
with
my
noodle
bowl
notes
botanical
garden
in
brooklyn
and
paired
with
a
burger
it
did
the
job
in
85
degree
heat
and
did
not
offend
me
i
remember
saying
it
was
a
simple
beer
and
it
was
just
average
d
this
is
my
goto
beer
for
pairing
with
japanese
food
and
sushi
light
and
simple
the
flavors
are
not
dominant
enough
to
drown
out
the
subtleties
of
sushi
but
the
effervescence
cleanses
the
palate
like
a
piece
of
pickled
ginger
but
while
ive
had
this
beer
a
hundred
time
before
i
virtually
never
drink
it
on
its
own
for
these
same
reasons
theres
not
much
flavor
and
its
over
carbonated
decent
enough
taste
not
the
most
flavorful
beer
in
the
world
but
on
an
88
degree
april
day
it
hit
the
spot
i
could
have
had
a
few
brisk
lively
carbonation
light
bodied
first
of
all
before
i
start
what
is
up
with
the
can
the
indestructable
can
that
thing
is
heavy
when
empty
and
dense
as
steel
anyways
pours
with
fluffy
rocky
head
golden
yellow
with
minimal
retentionlacing
smell
was
somewhat
yeasty
but
mostly
cereal
like
with
a
touch
of
sweet
taste
actually
had
some
citrus
to
it
some
bread
some
grass
kinda
like
if
you
took
a
belgian
pale
and
watered
it
down
wasnt
terrible
though
for
a
macro
lager
mouthfeel
was
light
and
watery
a
crispness
to
it
due
to
the
high
carbonation
overall
not
bad
but
i
think
id
take
a
bud
light
over
this
any
day
id
take
this
over
a
high
life
or
corona
while
not
good
its
certainly
not
bad
its
worth
a
try
as
its
better
than
alot
of
bmc
stuff
pours
a
light
yellow
colored
body
with
a
small
white
colored
head
has
a
malty
aroma
but
not
very
strong
some
alcohol
taste
and
some
malts
not
nutty
but
kinda
biting
almost
acidic
malty
taste
less
biting
as
it
warms
up
it
reminded
me
of
corona
not
good
at
all
please
save
your
money
folks
not
recommended
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
no
date
or
anything
on
the
bottle
poors
yellowish
or
straw
looking
color
no
real
head
although
it
had
a
nice
little
delicate
lacing
and
a
thin
headfoam
all
the
way
down
it
looked
heavily
carbonated
it
had
the
faint
aroma
of
grains
andor
grass
along
with
corn
no
hops
detected
taste
is
very
thin
very
light
bodied
slight
taste
of
grain
is
evident
along
with
a
corn
like
taste
heavily
carbonated
and
light
in
the
mouth
no
bitterness
at
all
the
taste
is
very
faint
thin
and
really
lacking
hardly
an
aftertaste
at
all
as
a
result
it
is
easy
to
drink
and
is
a
rather
boring
brew
md
light
and
crisp
goes
down
easy
but
the
taste
just
doesnt
do
it
for
me
at
all
if
i
was
heading
this
direction
in
a
beer
i
would
just
as
soon
grab
the
old
silver
bullet
drinkability
its
not
bad
im
glad
to
have
tried
this
brew
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
have
again
taste
was
bitter
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
the
drinkability
was
average
i
suppose
not
something
i
would
seek
out
like
a
lot
of
international
beers
today
it
doesnt
beat
a
lot
of
the
domestic
beers
available
today
its
an
okay
beer
but
for
the
cost
i
expected
something
more
especially
since
my
bottle
was
brewed
in
canada
not
japan
its
slightly
better
than
american
macros
but
for
the
price
i
would
rather
have
one
of
them
easydrinking
and
remarkably
better
and
more
characterful
than
many
macroimports
this
is
one
to
go
to
for
a
nice
session
beer
the
dark
brown
bottle
was
misleading
disguising
this
light
yellow
lager
theres
almost
no
carbonation
or
lacing
not
much
to
smell
just
a
little
more
to
taste
i
would
say
it
tastes
good
for
a
macro
lager
it
doesnt
have
the
offensive
sting
that
the
average
macro
does
so
this
would
be
a
good
alternative
at
the
bar
if
im
almost
out
of
money
d
is
to
drink
just
not
a
whole
lot
going
on
with
it
d
goes
well
with
light
meals
all
in
all
it
could
have
been
worse
wasnt
great
but
hey
its
a
japanese
lager
i
ended
up
having
a
second
one
and
it
was
better
than
the
sake
my
girlfriend
had
i
think
its
better
than
budweiser
but
only
just
d
overall
i
cant
say
this
is
a
terrible
or
bad
tasting
beer
its
just
that
there
is
hardly
any
taste
at
all
unimpressed
find
something
else
drinkability
is
somewhat
low
i
drank
the
whole
22
oz
but
i
wouldnt
get
another
i
didnt
pick
up
the
check
so
i
dont
know
how
much
they
were
charging
for
it
but
budweiser
or
bud
light
would
have
been
preferable
and
definately
cheaper
d
i
could
drink
this
on
occasion
i
remember
drinking
these
at
a
japanese
steak
house
in
the
past
and
they
went
well
with
the
meal
i
cant
say
i
was
overly
impressed
by
this
but
i
was
disappointed
one
bit
if
this
were
more
widely
available
in
the
states
and
cheaper
i
think
it
would
be
very
popular
among
college
kids
and
people
looking
for
a
cheap
and
easy
buzz
i
would
not
recommend
this
beer
not
even
at
your
local
sushi
place
if
i
have
to
eat
squishy
fish
sliced
thin
and
put
on
top
of
sticky
rice
i
might
as
well
reach
for
this
one
drinkabilty
pretty
good
drinkabiltiy
and
doesnt
taste
too
bad
only
a
bit
better
than
american
macros
but
enough
so
to
be
enjoyable
definitely
goes
well
with
japanese
food
and
while
i
wouldnt
buy
this
normally
i
would
order
it
at
a
japanese
restaurant
d
goes
fine
with
sushi
probably
would
try
something
else
next
time
though
d
pretty
drinkable
as
it
doesnt
have
a
huge
amount
of
alcohol
taste
or
bitterness
to
it
m
d
a
good
little
sting
of
carbonation
on
the
front
rather
crisp
and
dry
towards
the
finish
something
of
a
pounder
this
would
be
not
the
most
intriguing
beer
but
not
horrid
by
any
means
it
would
do
alright
with
a
meal
had
this
beer
a
couple
times
at
hibachi
places
saw
the
giant
can
of
industrial
strength
and
picked
a
few
up
goes
great
with
thai
or
chinese
food
as
well
overall
rather
boring
but
not
a
bad
choice
when
paired
with
something
more
interesting
this
beer
has
become
a
staple
for
my
friends
and
i
anyway
pours
out
a
nice
light
yellow
color
with
a
12
inch
frothy
head
nice
smells
of
rice
and
it
smells
very
fresh
oh
man
does
this
stuff
taste
good
its
got
a
nice
light
smooth
taste
goes
down
smooth
nicely
carbonated
nice
and
full
mouthfeel
i
would
of
gave
this
one
a
5
for
drinkability
but
since
i
find
that
the
bottled
version
of
sapporo
tastes
much
better
than
the
canned
so
thats
why
i
docked
it
5
anyway
this
a
great
light
beer
with
5
abv
and
its
of
high
quality
and
can
really
mix
with
almost
any
food
i
highly
recommend
this
one
cheers
d
good
at
being
what
it
is
certainly
a
decent
representation
of
the
style
its
just
not
that
interesting
the
weird
finish
put
me
off
drinkability
entirely
inoffensive
sweet
low
in
alcohol
and
a
way
to
knock
out
a
style
really
its
not
bad
i
suppose
but
theres
so
little
going
on
here
that
its
hardly
of
any
consequence
from
a
limited
dated
journal
light
amber
in
color
good
foamy
head
nice
bitterness
with
a
slight
hoppy
balance
light
fruitiness
and
frankly
quite
refreshing
this
was
tasty
after
a
day
working
in
the
garden
but
not
something
id
crack
open
regularly
this
beer
is
actually
surprisingly
drinkable
and
an
ok
example
for
the
style
very
crisp
good
served
cold
and
paired
with
snack
food
pours
a
clear
gold
with
minimal
head
smells
of
slightly
grainy
but
theres
not
a
whole
lot
there
the
faintest
nose
ive
come
across
this
pretty
accurately
describes
the
taste
as
well
a
slight
hop
finish
certainly
not
bad
just
not
much
there
pretty
refreshing
eric
my
first
japanese
beer
and
a
very
good
one
at
that
pours
a
light
golden
and
filled
with
ascending
bubbles
smell
is
of
rice
but
in
a
good
way
not
like
the
adjuncts
used
in
bmc
i
thought
this
was
a
crisp
refreshing
beer
that
went
down
easy
sure
it
doesnt
have
the
most
flavor
but
it
was
nice
to
have
after
a
long
hard
day
of
work
mouthfeel
is
good
nice
levels
of
carbonation
light
in
body
drinkability
is
very
good
at
least
in
that
you
could
drink
it
all
night
this
is
not
a
particularly
good
beer
though
it
is
true
to
style
i
suppose
this
is
somewhat
clean
for
macro
standards
but
feels
a
little
heavy
for
the
taste
profile
doesnt
work
bad
with
sushi
but
not
something
id
reach
for
regularly
poured
a
light
gold
color
with
a
small
white
head
at
the
pour
very
little
carbonation
smelled
of
malts
grain
rice
and
maybe
a
dash
of
hops
it
was
pretty
foul
taste
is
slightly
bitter
at
the
back
of
the
mouth
not
something
i
would
drink
again
ever
i
expected
sapporo
to
be
skunky
like
the
few
chinese
brews
ive
had
have
been
but
sapporo
overall
left
me
impressed
while
i
could
drink
quite
a
bit
of
this
i
had
it
at
a
japanese
steak
house
for
8
a
pop
ouch
fuck
that
no
where
near
that
quality
to
be
worth
that
much
maybe
if
i
could
find
it
on
the
cheap
sometimes
but
i
doubt
thatll
happen
serve
well
chilled
add
some
sushi
and
a
sunset
a
good
quaffer
under
these
circumstances
i
poured
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
a
stanard
pint
glass
thwe
brew
is
a
pale
straw
colored
yellow
with
an
abundant
quickly
dissipating
head
the
beer
has
a
very
faint
malty
aroma
on
the
tongue
it
is
slightly
sweet
no
hop
bitterness
detected
i
felt
the
beer
was
a
bit
thin
but
this
made
it
more
drinakable
overall
this
is
a
pretty
standard
lager
good
for
hot
daysbbq
and
a
general
thirst
quencher
pours
a
clear
goldenyellow
with
a
large
white
foamy
head
with
the
head
leaving
decent
lacing
the
smell
is
light
with
only
hints
of
floral
aromas
and
sweet
malt
the
taste
is
lightcrisp
with
floral
and
sweet
maltlike
the
smell
the
mf
is
light
and
not
impressive
this
is
a
typical
large
macro
beerwith
only
some
flavor
and
little
else
comes
in
a
neat
silver
can
although
that
doesnt
boost
the
taste
any
a
small
notch
above
some
of
the
true
crap
swill
light
golden
color
not
a
bad
head
on
it
malty
grassy
flavor
a
bit
sweet
and
wheaty
it
is
somewhat
refreshing
didnt
sample
this
with
any
japanese
food
but
i
dont
see
how
it
would
be
any
better
that
way
this
is
a
good
hot
day
beer
perfect
for
those
bbqs
and
backyard
pool
parties
a
great
everyday
beer
overall
marginal
if
you
get
a
chance
fine
if
you
never
get
the
chance
fine
poured
a
22oz
bomber
into
my
new
belgium
globe
this
beer
pours
a
light
straw
yellow
with
just
a
hint
of
a
puffy
white
head
the
aroma
is
boiled
rice
slightly
soured
milk
and
a
hint
of
canned
corn
the
taste
is
really
basic
rice
a
bit
of
adjunct
and
for
some
reason
just
a
bit
of
milk
the
mouthfeel
is
much
fuller
then
a
normal
macro
lager
its
still
light
but
the
rice
must
add
a
bit
of
body
to
it
also
the
carbonation
is
more
toned
down
than
a
macro
too
this
is
definitely
my
go
to
beer
when
i
get
sushi
but
not
something
i
seek
out
pours
clear
pale
gold
medium
sized
head
with
some
nice
lacing
for
the
style
smell
is
mostly
grassy

is

crispness
distinct
light
maltadjunct
aftertaste
thats
not
unpleasant
some
grassy
hops
again
light
to
medium
mouthfeel
wet
pretty
drinkable
overall
a
pretty
standard
generic
lager
not
bad
d
not
awful
but
im
not
sure
that
i
would
want
to
drink
again
d
very
drinkable
pairs
nicely
with
chinese
food
as
well
as
american
grub
a
palate
cleaner
for
sure
good
beer
to
drink
at
1130
in
the
morning
i
have
considered
buying
the
double
deuce
numerous
times
over
the
years
well
tonight
i
gave
into
temptation
and
purchased
one
i
got
home
after
work
and
popped
it
open
poured
it
into
a
glass
and
was
intrigued
by
its
interesting
taste
the
first
glass
was
pretty
good
but
buy
the
time
i
finished
the
whole
can
i
was
a
little
disapointed
this
beer
tasted
rather
sweet
to
me
the
greatest
aspect
of
this
beer
is
the
beautiful
silver
can
that
it
comes
in
next
time
i
will
not
hesitate
to
pass
right
on
by
this
beer
drinkability
is
good
for
an
environment
like
this
this
goes
great
with
oriental
dinners
and
even
if
you
wanna
try
something
exotic
on
a
weekend
this
is
a
good
goto
beer
not
bad
stuff
at
all
d
not
bad
i
could
drink
this
over
a
macro
if
there
wasnt
the
import
premium
on
the
price
this
might
be
why
it
wasnt
selling
at
the
bar
dont
know
not
bad
though
d
drinkability
was
ok
not
bad
flavor
wise
but
really
didnt
encourage
me
to
looking
forward
to
finishing
the
drink
mediocrity
at
its
finest
mouth
very
dry
body
from
start
to
finish
lovely
bubbles
tickle
the
mouth
hoppy
bitter
dry
long
lasting
finish
not
exceedingly
complex
but
very
little
to
complain
about
nice
and
refreshing
serving
type
bottle
drinkability
off
the
charts
as
this
is
one
step
away
from
water
i
do
like
the
shapely
silver
can
with
the
bevels
on
it
though
overall
refreshing
overly
carbonated
but
not
otherwise
interesting
if
it
was
carbonated
a
reasonable
level
it
would
probably
be
even
less
interesting
at
least
the
can
is
kind
of
cool
as
far
as
cans
go
d
though
not
a
particularly
good
beer
and
a
little
pricey
for
what
it
is
it
wouldnt
be
a
bad
alternative
to
american
macros
same
general
idea
but
pulled
off
with
a
slightly
different
spin
this
pours
an
average
lager
yellow
and
doesnt
present
much
of
a
head
the
nose
is
grainy
and
unimpressive
guess
what
the
flavor
follows
suit
quite
light
with
some
rice
and
old
hops
a
light
body
has
a
bit
too
much
carbonation
to
go
down
well
just
another
macorish
lager
in
my
book
an
okay
beer
that
i
probably
wouldnt
seek
out
in
the
future
it
pours
a
very
clean
light
yellow
color
the
carbonation
level
was
very
low
and
it
didnt
make
much
of
a
head
its
aroma
and
flavor
were
subdued
with
hints
of
light
malts
and
rice
there
was
only
a
slight
dry
bitterness
on
the
tongue
the
body
was
thin
with
a
mild
carbonation
and
a
crisp
clean
finish
over
all
a
very
simple
ok
beer
nothing
quenching
or
very
sessionable
about
this
guy
like
the
tao
it
just
is
and
boring
at
that
wait
forget
the
tao
reference
the
universe
deserves
better
d
this
is
a
better
than
average
beer
that
really
paired
well
with
the
japanese
food
the
very
light
and
crisp
taste
was
a
plus
i
would
have
this
again
if
it
were
the
right
occasion
hell
i
might
would
have
this
for
the
hell
of
it
give
it
a
shot
somehow
it
manages
to
taste
boozy
while
being
only
5
alcohol
its
like
water
and
booze
strained
through
a
rice
paddy
and
served
two
days
later
nothing
youll
ever
want
d
not
too
drinkable
for
me
poor
combination
of
mouthfeel
and
taste
did
not
make
this
beer
overly
impressive
for
me
not
really
a
big
fan
of
this
beer
if
im
ranking
strictly
by
style
i
gotta
admit
this
isnt
half
bad
the
taste
is
very
clean
and
crisp
and
very
light
but
this
does
seem
a
step
above
your
typical
bmc
offerings
mouthfeel
is
appropriate
for
the
style
light
and
moderately
carbonated
this
beer
is
built
for
drinkability
and
i
cant
deny
it
props
for
that
in
ranking
it
maybe
it
just
brings
back
good
memories
of
my
visits
to
japan
but
in
those
rare
times
when
im
just
looking
for
something
to
drink
that
i
dont
have
to
think
about
and
its
hotter
than
hedouble
hockey
sticks
i
wouldnt
mind
having
a
can
of
this
around
also
you
have
to
admit
the
can
is
pretty
badass
poured
the
22oz
can
into
a
pils
glass
why
because
ba
recommened
it
and
received
a
clearish
golden
body
with
a
fluffy
twofinger
head
that
crashed
quickly
but
left
lace
patches
a
husky
grainy
smell
that
was
somewhat
airy
and
had
very
little
hop
presence
a
lightmedium
body
with
a
smooth
almost
silky
finish
very
little
taste
to
speak
of
other
than
rice
natch
but
there
is
very
mild
sweetness
in
this
beer
and
there
was
no
aluminum
coming
off
in
it
a
simplistic
but
enjoyable
beer
id
have
another
one
but
i
wont
actively
seek
this
every
time
i
am
at
the
store
drinkability
is
low
for
me
it
wasnt
the
worst
beer
ive
had
but
i
wont
try
it
again
ill
order
a
20
ouncer
with
raw
fish
but
not
what
id
spend
my
money
on
to
drink
at
home
d
only
one
or
two
with
dinner
great
drink
before
a
glass
of
sake
drinkability
a
good
fun
beer
that
is
very
refreshing
overall
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
a
lot
better
than
a
macro
lager
on
the
whole
this
is
not
a
drinkable
beer
it
doesnt
seem
to
have
much
complexity
in
the
least
nothing
great
my
pour
produced
a
finger
and
a
half
of
fluffy
bonewhite
head
with
low
retention
but
nice
lacing
the
color
was
a
light
yellow
with
nequality
clarity
the
nose
was
faint
and
definitely
sweet
very
lagerlike
but
how
does
one
discern
rice
mouthfeel
was
thin
to
medium
with
a
pleasant
sweetness
on
the
tongue
finish
was
light
slightly
sweet
and
refreshing
not
bad
kind
of
innocuous
but
a
lot
of
beer
22
oz
for
a
little
bit
of
cabbage
id
certainly
take
this
over
some
of
that
russian
swill
that
i
choked
down
at
a
comparable
price
this
beer
went
well
with
my
sushi
it
absolutely
compliments
the
food
i
was
eating
it
with
very
basic
flavors
it
would
also
go
well
with
a
hot
summer
day
overall
an
okay
beer
not
the
best
lager
i
ever
had
but
clean
crisp
dry
and
light
this
is
not
at
all
hard
to
drink
a
bit
light
overall
in
flavor
but
not
a
headache
inducer
like
others
of
its
kind
can
be
tried
this
on
tap
at
haru
sushi
restaurant
this
past
friday
night
looks
like
an
average
lager
that
was
served
in
a
tall
pilsner
glass
the
smell
reminded
me
of
all
the
average
macro
beers
out
there
the
taste
was
pretty
much
the
same
the
only
redeeming
quality
was
the
fact
that
is
brewed
with
rice
this
type
of
lager
is
a
good
accompaniment
to
sushi
since
the
rice
flavor
compliments
the
food
and
the
flavor
is
not
too
strong
so
that
it
doesnt
conflict
with
the
ginger
and
wasabi
you
may
be
eating
not
a
bad
choice
at
a
sushi
restaurant
but
not
really
anywhere
else
another
good
combo
is
miller
high
life
bass
pale
ale
this
is
a
pretty
mediocre
beer
if
there
ever
was
one
the
look
of
the
beer
is
what
youd
come
to
expect
in
that
its
all
pale
lager
minimal
head
retention
lacing
the
smell
what
smell
it
disappeared
on
me
before
i
had
enough
time
to
contemplate
it
the
taste
is
adjunct
lots
of
it
some
straw
grass
rice
and
perhaps
a
bit
of
sweetener
in
there
too
the
only
interesting
quality
to
the
beer
is
the
ever
so
slight
nutty
tinges
around
the
periphery
of
the
taste
beyond
that
its
sweet
adjunct
definite
thin
rice
pale
malts
and
watery
lager
i
guess
you
can
drink
lots
of
this
beer
given
the
modest
abv
but
why
im
glad
i
tried
it
but
im
not
going
back
again
when
i
go
out
for
asian
food
ill
get
a
tsingtao
or
a
singha
as
a
beer
beverage
not
sapporo
one
and
done
overall
light
and
refreshing
solidly
average
example
of
the
style
update
recent
split
a
6pack
with
a
friend
hmmm
seems
more
processed
and
rough
around
forget
regular
sapporo
look
for
sapporo
reserve
instead
d
went
perfect
with
my
meal
ive
quaffed
these
before
and
they
are
very
very
drinkable
its
flavor
says
please
drink
more
of
me
over
and
over
again
after
first
sip
please
drink
more
please
drink
more
the
sapporo
cries
i
say
otay
i
felt
this
beer
seems
like
it
would
be
a
decent
regular
beer
for
me
if
i
could
find
it
for
a
cheap
price
goes
down
easy
and
doesnt
fill
you
up
too
fast
and
it
has
a
flavor
that
you
can
come
back
to
easy
enough
nice
friendly
beer
pours
a
light
straw
color
with
a
nice
soapy
pure
white
head
that
dissipated
quickly
into
a
sudsy
cap
this
brew
is
a
shade
or
so
lighter
than
your
standard
macro
the
smell
is
grainy
and
sweet
from
the
adjuncts
it
has
a
tin
like
aroma
as
well
the
brew
has
a
sweet
rice
flavor
a
bit
grainy
slight
bready
malt
and
a
light
metallic
twang
either
from
being
in
a
can
or
the
small
amount
of
hops
the
feel
is
watery
and
well
carbonated
finishes
like
seltzer
water
this
brew
is
lighter
tasting
than
your
standard
american
macro
it
is
not
as
grainy
as
the
macro
and
holds
up
better
when
it
gets
warmer
definitely
not
as
astringent
as
the
macro
good
pairing
with
sushi
as
they
are
both
light
a
good
alternative
to
bmc
drinkability
very
drinkable
beer
one
of
my
favorites
from
japan
without
a
doubt
the
best
macrorice
lager
available
people
need
to
understand
the
style
and
intent
before
rating
this
beer
overall
a
pretty
good
cheap
and
refreshing
brew
nothing
horrible
here
yet
also
nothing
that
really
stands
out
overall
a
pretty
average
refreshing
brew
nothing
great
hereeasy
to
consumekinda
lightgood
for
a
trybut
i
prefer
something
a
little
more
flavorful
moral
of
the
story
decent
beer
in
the
right
setting
outside
of
a
restaurant
experience
this
is
not
going
on
my
list
of
to
be
bought
beers
try
it
and
see
for
yourself
its
a
nice
lager
and
makes
no
claims
otherwise
d
this
is
one
of
the
better
japanese
beers
that
ive
had
its
worth
a
try
man
youve
got
to
give
a
little
respect
to
a
can
this
big
even
for
a
light
lager
its
still
a
little
intimidating
now
as
a
beer
its
light
bland
and
super
clean
i
was
surprised
that
the
beer
ended
on
a
note
of
spicy
hops
but
the
rest
was
just
a
plain
sweet
stream
of
liquid
that
resembled
beer
hops
good
malt
bad
i
guess
its
better
than
them
both
sucking
hands
down
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
ever
had
it
hasnt
received
the
best
rating
but
for
for
someone
that
is
just
getting
into
the
beer
tasting
i
found
it
very
enjoyable
it
was
not
overpowering
or
lacking
in
flavor
the
head
poured
very
thick
at
first
but
no
more
than
two
fingers
i
only
gave
it
a
4
5
in
smell
because
it
could
have
used
a
little
more
aroma
yet
another
i
could
add
to
my
arsenal
of
regular
beers
d
a
better
beer
than
i
expected
on
par
with
some
of
the
better
european
lagers
a
good
choice
in
a
japanese
restaurant
i
liked
it
overall
but
not
going
to
blow
you
away
its
been
a
long
time
since
i
had
this
and
its
not
as
good
as
i
remember
served
ice
cold
with
some
spicy
asian
fare
itd
be
yummy
as
just
a
beer
to
drink
much
less
so
though
its
not
undrinkable
by
any
stretch
and
yeah
the
can
is
cool
decent
but
usually
overpriced
when
it
is
essentially
a
japanese
budweiser
comment
it
is
reminiscent
of
a
lot
of
american
light
lagers
perhaps
its
the
rice
and
excessive
carbonation
that
does
the
trick
it
is
not
a
memorable
beer
could
not
drink
too
many
of
these
but
a
pretty
good
beer
none
the
less
light
clean
and
crisp
i
have
to
say
im
very
suprised
by
the
taste
and
appearance
of
this
beer
this
is
the
first
time
ive
ever
had
a
japanese
beer
let
alone
a
rice
beer
that
i
know
of
it
almost
hints
of
a
tripel
ale
very
clean
pour
and
clean
feel
on
the
tongue
i
very
highly
recommend
this
beer
never
had
this
style
before
pours
a
nice
scant
yellow
color
with
a
decent
head
smells
of
rice
and
bread
with
a
mild
sweetness
taste
has
many
of
the
rice
notes
except
that
its
kind
of
bready
and
dry
nothing
too
impressive
but
definitely
not
offensive
goes
down
smooth
though
not
bad
at
all
the
aftertaste
is
a
bit
dry
as
well
twelve
oz
bottle
color
of
pale
yellow
with
a
off
white
colored
head

light
nose
of
rice
soap
and
some
metallic

taste
of
rice
soap
and
with
some
bitterness
body
is
light
and
with
medium
carbonation

aftertaste
of
rice
bread
and
soap
i
tried
this
beer
on
august
13
2007
after
purchasing
from
the
local
lcbo
store
the
beer
a
nice
translucent
gold
colour
into
the
glass
with
a
large
white
loose
head
the
aroma
was
very
weak
wwith
no
discernable
scents
the
mouthfeel
was
weak
and
watery
with
some
hints
of
carbonation
the
flavour
was
also
weak
with
little
or
no
discernable
flavours
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
shaker
this
beer
poured
a
clear
golden
color
with
huge
visible
carbonation
bubbles
dancing
throughout
the
glass
a
very
thin
fizzy
white
head
quickly
disappeared
the
aroma
was
grain
and
sweet
malts
the
flavor
was
mildly
sweet
with
notes
of
grain
and
some
faint
hops
at
the
end
the
mouthfeel
was
light
and
slightly
watery
with
high
carbonation
what
else
is
there
to
say
just
another
average
beer
overall
i
might
consider
this
a
stepup
from
a
basic
american
macro
but
its
definately
not
far
off
packaged
in
a
custom
twentytwo
ounce
steel
can
served
in
a
standard
pint
tap
glass
the
flavors
dont
bend
well
resulting
in
an
unbalanced
beer
i
simply
didnt
like
this
one
i
did
not
find
a
single
redemptive
characteristic
i
will
not
be
visiting
this
one
again
cheers
poured
from
the
500ml
heavyduty
can
into
a
pint
glass
body
is
a
pale
translucent
straw
color
topped
by
a
minuscule
amount
of
fizzy
white
head
aroma
of
adjunct
malt
and
just
a
touch
of
aromatic
hops
palate
is
light
and
refreshing
a
lightly
sweet
malt
character
accented
by
a
muted
hop
profile
body
is
thin
as
expected
but
not
unpleasantly
so
a
pretty
good
thirst
quencher
after
mowing
the
lawn
but
i
wouldnt
want
it
around
for
everyday
consumption
dr
once
you
get
used
to
the
unusual
flavor
it
goes
down
pretty
easily
but
its
somewhat
macrolike
thus
not
my
style
the
taste
is
malty
and
grainy
and
slightly
sweet

but
not
to
the
point
of
being
cloying
theres
very
little
in
the
way
of
hop
bitterness
here
though
the
crisp
dry
finish
redeems
it
a
bit
all
in
all
a
little
lightbodied
for
me
as
far
as
japanese
beers
go
i
prefer
kirin
and
even
thats
a
relative
statement
and
i
wouldnt
drink
this
unless
outside
the
context
of
a
japanese
restaurant
pours
a
typical
clear
goldenyellow
like
most
any
other
lager
has
a
nice
thick
head
though
aroma
is
strong
and
fairly
malty
about
average
for
this
kind
of
beer
flavor
is
crisp
but
nothing
special
nevertheless
it
is
refreshing
ok
if
nothing
better
is
available
fine
for
a
party
or
cookout
got
this
one
at
a
japanese
restaurant
on
the
recommendation
of
the
waitress
pours
a
standard
macrolager
straw
color
with
a
minimal
head
that
disappears
too
quickly
nose
is
nearly
nonexistent
taste
is
just
like
a
bud
grain
and
malt
nothing
much
else
feel
is
standard
fairly
solid
carbonation
overall
its
pretty
much
macrocrap
with
a
japanese
label
which
i
guess
makes
it
better
although
not
really
this
is
a
beer
that
i
will
not
likely
purchase
again
that
is
unless
im
in
an
oriental
restaurant
and
i
find
it
on
the
menu
however
the
label
indicates
its
brewed
in
canada
my
first
japanese
beer
and
it
was
brewed
by
our
neighbor
to
the
north
hmh
d
not
very
tasty
doesnt
go
down
very
easily
slightly
filling
i
found
it
quite
difficult
to
get
through
the
can
that
i
had
luckily
it
was
just
one
and
would
definitely
not
drink
this
beer
again
drinkability
exactly
what
i
expected
refreshing
to
balance
the
saltiness
of
the
sushi
i
was
eating
but
nothing
special
overall
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
imo
the
best
of
the
macro
lagers
and
one
which
i
turn
to
quite
often
this
beer
to
me
resembles
a
domestic
light
beer
not
much
carbonation
with
a
watery
taste
and
little
to
no
aftertaste
i
would
classify
this
as
incredibly
average
there
is
nothing
to
this
beer
that
would
make
me
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
it
dont
get
me
wrong
its
not
bad
it
just
falls
in
with
the
same
taste
as
many
other
beers
taste
isnt
anything
to
write
home
about
either
i
was
trying
to
distinguish
if
there
was
any
kind
of
noticeable
rice
twist
on
this
one
but
came
out
with
nothing
other
than
the
ordinary
slightly
sour
very
cerealadjunct
low
bitterness
taste
youve
come
to
expect
from
light
lagers
overall
its
not
terrible
since
it
goes
down
somewhat
smoothly
and
doesnt
have
a
bad
aftertaste
but
if
youre
expecting
something
different
youre
in
for
disappointment
pretty
much
your
basic
worldwide
macro
lager
pale
yellow
with
a
fizzy
head
not
much
bouqet
some
faint
noble
hops
very
faint
along
with
a
slight
metallic
aroma
no
malts
noticed
either
in
the
nose
or
taste
very
dry
with
a
crisp
finish
lots
of
forced
carbonation
clean
but
uninteresting
flavors
no
reason
to
drink
much
of
this
other
than
to
cleanse
your
palate
or
to
get
drunk
the
sculpted
silver
can
is
a
beautiful
marketing
tool
for
sapporo
it
looks
great
its
reminiscent
of
a
keg
looks
modern
actually
iits
quite
like
a
lot
of
japanese
architecture
and
fits
nicely
in
your
hand
beyond
that
the
beer
is
pretty
average
the
sample
i
had
was
brewed
in
guelph
ontario
canada
ill
assume
under
contract
through
sleeman
it
was
clean
in
the
nose
and
mouth
and
offered
a
delicate
combination
of
softly
grainy
malt
and
diffused
floral
and
spicy
hops
all
the
way
through
it
was
smooth
and
round
and
very
wellbalanced
just
lacking
in
any
character
that
would
make
it
stand
out
from
the
pack
in
fact
if
theres
any
negative
to
this
beer
its
that
the
crystalclear
strawgold
body
lacked
anything
more
than
a
shortlived
creamy
head
of
bright
white
overall
no
flaws
but
no
sparkling
moments
either
this
is
apparently
japans
answer
to
americas
bmc
macros
pours
to
a
clear
golden
yellow
with
little
head
or
lacing
an
almost
skunky
grainy
aroma
and
a
flavor
of
wet
grainy
cardboard
palate
was
stale
and
dry
nothing
special
about
this
beer
at
all
capable
brewer
even
if
this
sapporo
is
pretty
average
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
beer
is
a
clear
very
light
golden
color
with
a
bubbly
white
head
smell
is
sweet
with
malt
and
adjuncts
taste
is
also
sweet
with
a
tiny
bit
of
bittering
hops
not
much
going
on
at
all
the
mouthfeel
is
light
with
lots
of
bubbly
carbonation
this
beer
is
drinkable
like
water
mostly
because
it
has
very
little
character
and
is
very
light
in
body
as
always
though
just
because
you
can
do
something
doesnt
necessarily
mean
you
should
this
is
better
than
most
american
lagers
but
i
dont
think
i
would
drink
this
under
any
other
circumstances
horrible
appearance
no
sign
of
any
head
or
carbonation
scattered
bubbles
rising
from
the
bottom
the
color
is
a
clear
straw
yellow
aroma
has
a
slight
skunk
cheap
malt
liqiour
smell
typical
lager
taste
that
has
a
crispness
and
a
slight
hop
bite
on
the
finish
this
seems
like
headache
beer
to
me
the
mouthfeel
isnt
that
bad
and
deserves
a
3
for
just
average
has
a
better
taste
than
bud
but
other
than
that
its
bad
i
think
japan
should
stick
to
making
cars
and
not
beer
taste
is
grainy
with
some
dry
biscuit
aftertaste
felt
almost
flat
and
listless
in
my
mouth
certainly
wouldnt
be
flying
to
japan
just
to
sample
beer
if
this
is
the
best
they
can
do
this
is
a
good
beer
to
compliment
an
asian
meal
but
there
is
nothing
spectacular
about
it
average
lager
appearance
of
a
light
gold
smelling
of
light
grains
and
a
taste
that
isnt
repulsive
but
isnt
interesting
either
feels
dry
and
lightbodied
on
the
mouth
and
drinkable
especially
with
some
spicy
dishes
drinkability
is
average
not
great
and
nothing
compared
to
any
of
the
crafts
out
there
but
still
a
decent
choice
when
out
to
a
sushi
joint
if
asahi
is
not
available
overall
i
was
impressed
with
this
beer
it
had
much
more
flavor
than
i
anticipated
and
its
light
body
and
moderate
hop
profile
make
it
a
perfect
beer
to
pair
with
spicy
asian
cuisine
poured
a
pale
yellow
with
no
head
and
lots
of
visible
carbonation
there
was
no
realy
discernable
smell
and
really
no
taste
to
it
it
was
this
or
a
bud
light
at
dinner
and
it
probably
would
have
been
a
draw
its
drinkable
ice
cold
in
a
frosted
mug
but
by
the
time
it
warmed
up
i
had
wished
i
ordered
tea
cool
can
nonaluminum
okay
beer
but
too
expensive
for
what
it
is
d
goes
down
like
water
water
is
cheaper
though
but
then
this
will
give
you
an
alcohol
buzz
macro
lager
all
the
way
not
worth
your
time
of
the
japanese
brands
available
in
this
area
sapporo
is
easily
the
most
drinkable
the
color
is
clear
yellow
with
a
nice
foamy
head
that
disappears
quickly
and
completely
smell
is
clean
with
little
in
the
nose
mouthful
is
thin
but
likely
a
bit
better
than
many
other
imported
macros
taste
is
surprisingly
pleasant
and
relatively
flavorful
not
much
malt
but
a
nice
fruity
hops
flavor
that
along
with
the
smoothness
provided
by
the
rice
adjunct
presents
a
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
beer
yoku
dekimashita
just
another
average
macro
in
the
style
would
help
wash
down
a
plate
of
lo
mein
perfectly
it
is
only
an
average
alternative
if
you
are
eating
at
an
asian
restaurant
mouthfeel
was
thin
and
somewhat
watery
mildly
zesty
yet
smooth
in
the
finish
medium
pale
straw
color
with
a
nice
creamy
head
atop
smells
weak
but
with
a
touch
of
rice
husks
taste
is
better
than
smell
more
body
than
most
other
asian
beers
ive
tried
still
is
rice
dominate
but
has
a
nicer
sweetness
with
no
off
flavors
like
many
beers
in
its
categories
a
touch
fruity
with
good
carbonation
in
the
middle
finish
is
super
dry
just
nothing
quenches
my
thirst
for
sure
overall
drink
it
while
youre
mowing
your
lawn
or
putting
on
a
new
roof
d
eh
this
doesnt
impress
me
mouthfeeldrinkability
ahhh
yes
thankfully
the
mouthfeel
here
is
excellent
alive
and
elegant
with
nice
prickliness
no
doubt
this
has
its
place
with
japanese
food
its
easy
drinking
and
its
lack
of
character
is
actually
a
positive
spin
you
could
argue
save
this
one
for
your
next
trip
to
the
sushi
bar
hmm
not
really
doing
it
for
me
the
malt
content
is
really
unbalanced
and
the
bitterness
is
rather
annoying
the
carbonation
is
really
what
gets
me
as
it
is
far
too
fizzy
for
its
own
good
this
screams
food
beer
after
pairing
with
a
threecourse
sushi
meal
the
flavors
are
neutralized
somewhat
although
there
is
a
grainy
aftertaste
that
persists
not
one
of
my
favorites
pours
yellow
with
a
funky
foamy
head
that
quickly
dissipates
nose
is
somewhat
fruity
with
a
hint
of
malt
taste
is
crisp
and
clean
a
bit
of
malt
with
very
little
hops
goes
well
with
japanese
steak
mouth
feel
was
light
with
lots
of
carbonation
overall
an
average
beer
that
goes
well
with
oriental
food
taste
is
sweet
for
the
style
medium
bodied
pretty
smooth
slightly
dry
finish
nothing
remarkable
about
this
but
decent
enough
seems
like
a
thirst
quencher
type
of
beer
aftertaste
was
clean
and
refreshing
drinkability
easy
to
drink
im
sure
itd
go
great
with
japanese
or
american
food
this
is
slaking
my
summer
thirst
quite
well
and
its
altogether
not
a
bad
beer
but
its
just
different
like
other
reviewers
i
have
a
strong
feeling
that
this
would
pair
extremely
well
with
the
delicate
flavors
of
sashimi
the
appearance
was
a
light
amber
with
a
pretty
standard
smell
for
a
lager
small
traces
of
rice
it
left
a
small
amount
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
taste
was
slightly
dry
with
a
fair
amount
of
carbonation
mouthfeel
was
ok
as
was
the
drinkability
this
beer
is
pretty
standard
goes
well
with
spicy
asian
food
but
would
also
be
totally
fine
with
american
fare
as
well
d
i
am
big
into
pairing
beer
with
food
and
even
though
i
would
not
drink
this
on
any
given
nite
i
certainly
will
order
it
again
when
having
sushiasian
food
not
recommended
this
review
seems
slim
but
there
is
nothing
more
to
add
about
this
beer
i
would
rather
consume
a
bmc
this
beer
poured
a
nice
clear
golden
yellow
with
a
nice
white
head
that
lasted
for
several
minutes
the
smell
is
hoppy
and
though
the
taste
at
first
seems
to
be
light
the
mouthfeel
is
full
and
hoppy
though
i
prefer
a
more
malty
beer
this
is
not
too
hoppy
for
me
to
consider
it
a
drinkable
beer
this
beer
poured
a
clear
goldenstraw
type
color
with
a
thick
persistent
head
the
smell
is
hoppy
and
very
reminiscent
of
what
i
think
of
as
bar
beer
the
taste
is
mellow
and
flavorful
it
is
not
as
hoppy
as
i
would
have
expected
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
thin
side
but
not
quite
watery
overall
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
and
could
be
considered
refreshing
this
beer
has
a
dark
golden
color
with
an
airy
head
that
sticks
around
as
you
drink
it
it
has
a
filtered
hoppy
smell
that
doesnt
over
power
the
flavor
is
faint
and
crisp
the
hops
are
balanced
well
the
beer
has
a
smooth
start
and
finishes
slightly
heavy
this
beer
is
drinkable
and
would
be
a
fine
accompaniment
to
a
stake
or
other
red
meat
d
it
is
an
okay
lager
not
something
that
i
would
grab
often
though
lots
of
carbonation
in
this
one
masks
alot
of
flavor
lightly
grassy
malt
definite
rice
character
in
there
just
enought
hop
to
keep
it
from
being
sweet
very
crisp
not
as
thin
as
you
would
expect
a
step
above
basic
for
a
japanese
lager
considering
where
its
from
and
the
style
not
bad
drinkability
im
sure
i
could
drink
a
bunch
of
these
in
succession
if
it
was
all
that
was
offered
but
im
not
impressed
bad
aftertaste
and
smell
really
detract
from
me
wanting
to
drink
more
than
one
of
these
i
cant
even
see
having
this
with
an
asian
meal
skip
it
if
you
do
venture
it
make
sure
its
cold
otherwise
a
funky
chemical
taste
sets
in
dont
buy
this
unless
its
cheap
its
not
anything
special
doesnt
taste
special
it
tastes
like
an
american
lager
i
dont
know
why
some
of
my
friends
think
this
is
so
awesome
its
pretty
decent
but
not
that
great
the
can
looks
pretty
cool
the
beer
is
not
as
impressive
this
stuff
smells
pretty
bad
some
cooked
cabbage
a
slightly
metallic
odor
makes
its
way
up
not
the
nicest
this
is
reflected
in
the
flavor
the
rice
is
evident
in
this
as
an
adjunct
this
isnt
the
smoothest
beer
ive
had
but
it
really
isnt
that
hard
to
drink
but
with
all
that
being
said
i
dont
think
id
be
rushing
out
to
get
this
one
again
overall
another
japanese
beer
imported
from
canada
overall
this
is
pretty
much
forgettable
but
i
wouldnt
turn
one
down
after
cutting
the
lawn
pours
a
pale
straw
yellow
with
a
smattering
of
white
foam
nose
is
light
but
with
more
character
than
i
would
expect
from
a
rice
lager
musty
with
a
bit
of
earthypeaty
sweetness
taste
follows
nose
sweet
rice
with
a
hearty
musk
and
a
hint
of
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
smooth
yet
crisp
not
nearly
as
crappy
as
i
would
have
expected
mixed
well
with
the
poorly
sung
but
heartfelt
songs
this
is
crisp
and
clean
and
sweet
for
the
most
part
but
lacks
the
depth
in
a
good
lager
that
i
enjoy
my
first
rice
lager
though
so
maybe
i
am
just
ignorant
to
the
style
at
any
rate
i
can
only
see
myself
partaking
in
this
lager
again
on
a
nice
hot
summer
day
possibly
at
the
beach
600
ml
brown
bottle
embossed
logo
on
shoulder
label
sports
the
large
gold
star
and
premium
banner
a
closer
look
at
the
fine
print
and
we
find
that
this
is
brewed
under
supervision
of
sapporo
by
sleeman
brewing
guelph
canada
pours
a
typical
pale
yellow
very
carbonated
which
gave
a
nice
white
head
but
shrank
away
in
about
one
minute
smell
of
sweet
corn
and
rice
no
discernable
hop
aromas
taste
wasnt
too
bad
slight
bitterness
in
the
finish
an
alright
beer
that
would
go
good
with
sushi
to
cut
the
salty
soy
sauce
but
not
what
i
would
call
a
premium
poured
from
a
22oz
can
into
a
glass
stein
its
a
rather
average
looking
beer
lots
of
head
forms
but
quickly
dissipates
nose
is
almost
undetectable
taste
is
pretty
solid
for
macro
lager
its
got
a
sort
of
sharp
flavor
interpreted
as
thin
by
some
possibly
as
a
result
of
the
rice
and
corn
used
in
addition
to
the
barley
and
hops
quite
well
balanced
all
in
all
and
certainly
different
than
most
macro
lagers
mouthfeel
is
pretty
average
for
this
sort
of
beer
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
there
i
find
this
beer
to
be
very
drinkable
if
youre
not
a
malt
or
hop
fiend
the
good
balance
between
malt
hops
rice
and
even
corn
is
its
best
feature
that
none
of
the
constituent
ingredients
overpowers
or
even
really
stands
out
from
the
rest
is
desirable
in
my
opinion
definitely
recommended
overall
some
elements
certainly
stick
in
my
mind
mostly
how
it
starts
to
hit
my
mouth
like
rock
salt
on
a
pretzel
certainly
drinkable
a
nice
drinkable
beer
good
when
you
are
at
a
japanese
restaurant
drinkability
beer
would
eventually
wear
on
me
however
i
do
not
regretting
getting
one
just
because
of
its
unique
taste
other
beers
feature
better
aroma
and
are
defianetely
more
drinkable
than
this
beer
bland
in
the
flavor
dept
and
a
rather
bland
mouthfeel
light
in
body
and
alcohol
as
well
quite
drinkable
and
not
bad
tasting
this
one
is
enough
for
my
liking
light
bodied
watery
mouthfeel
like
most
macros
fairly
easy
to
drink
drinkability
its
fine
and
easy
enough
to
drink
however
i
probably
will
not
seek
this
out
but
i
would
not
turn
down
a
free
one
a
fair
offering
albeit
nothing
special
pours
out
to
a
light
yellow
color
with
a
medium
high
level
of
carbonation
that
yeilds
a
large
white
foamy
head
some
lace
aromas
of
light
malt
sweet
adjuncts
grass
taste
was
light
on
the
palate
with
notes
of
rice
blandness
mild
watered
down
malt
grain
and
some
hay
mouthfeel
was
like
a
modern
day
eddie
murphy
movie
uneventful
and
boring
average
drinkability
maybe
on
a
hot
summer
day
only
for
the
cool
lookin
can
had
a
bottle
in
a
japanese
restaurant
in
pensacola
fl
tasted
like
a
macro
lager
straw
yellow
color
small
head
not
a
lot
of
aroma
has
a
slightly
hoppy
taste
not
as
bland
as
most
macro
lagers
mouthfeel
is
light
but
not
overly
watery
good
complement
for
food
and
i
could
drink
it
as
a
session
beer
but
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
why
pay
4
50
a
bottle
when
you
could
get
sa
boston
lager
or
yuengling
for
the
same
price
or
cheaper
drinkability
not
too
good
an
unatractive
and
forgettable
beer
not
worth
the
time
money
or
effort
goes
down
okay
went
good
with
my
sushi
this
performed
above
my
expectations
refereshing
if
nothing
else
more
hops
and
more
flavor
than
your
standard
american
macro
which
lends
a
higher
degree
of
drinkability
if
you
ask
me
crisp
and
dry
on
the
finish
with
a
touch
of
bitterness
and
a
milder
ergo
more
tolerable
carbonation
level
than
your
domestic
stuff
dont
be
mistaken
though
this
is
still
a
generic
light
lager
brewed
for
mass
markets
another
reviewer
wondered
if
people
would
still
buy
it
if
they
knew
its
made
in
canada
well
i
knew
that
and
i
still
bought
it
but
then
again
i
was
at
an
asian
restaurant
and
i
was
thirsty
it
went
fairly
well
with
my
spicy
beef
noodle
dish
by
the
way
guinness
extra
stout
is
brewed
in
canada
how
many
people
know
that
22
oz
sculpted
can
served
chilled
in
a
pilsner
glass
it
pours
a
very
bright
gold
with
a
1
finger
white
head
that
doesnt
leave
much
lacing
it
smells
of
adjuncts
some
skunk
and
maybe
some
grapeapple
notes
the
taste
is
about
the
same
with
a
hint
of
hops
on
top
of
a
light
and
tingly
body
average
at
best
will
not
be
seeking
it
out
again
while
this
isnt
all
that
bad
there
really
isnt
anything
to
bring
you
back
there
are
better
macros
out
there
to
spend
your
money
on
fairly
clean
and
refreshing
as
a
light
flavored
beer
goes
perhaps
a
decent
lawn
beer
but
there
are
so
many
better
choices
one
of
my
two
sushi
beers
i
really
surprised
i
like
this
beer
it
doesnt
fall
into
my
normal
range
i
most
often
have
this
beer
in
the
22oz
size
at
my
favorite
sushi
place
it
pours
a
crystal
clear
yellow
with
moderate
carbonation
and
decent
lacing
the
head
is
very
thin
and
doesnt
last
long
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
biting
the
taste
smooth
and
grain
flavored
its
really
too
light
if
not
drunk
with
food
it
has
a
bit
of
a
bite
at
the
finish
this
brew
pours
a
clear
pale
goldenstraw
color
the
head
is
onefinger
in
height
creamy
and
white
but
recedes
very
quickly
the
aroma
is
very
faint
and
of
pale
malt
it
is
very
simple
but
inoffensive
the
taste
well
there
really
isnt
one
there
is
a
slight
and
by
slight
i
mean
barely
detectable
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
nice
carbonation
overall
this
beer
isnt
quite
awful
but
if
you
want
something
with
taste
it
isnt
for
you
i
am
not
an
expert
on
japanese
rice
lagers
but
i
couldnt
see
why
a
brewery
wouldnt
be
able
to
make
one
with
a
little
more
flavor
than
this
brew
and
still
be
within
stylistic
guide
lines
overall
impression
not
much
going
on
here
ive
enjoyed
it
in
the
past
with
sushi
but
it
definitely
doesnt
hold
up
on
its
own
pours
a
clear
mediumpale
gold
with
a
small
white
head
that
quickly
diminishes
to
a
thin
film
god
lacing
the
smell
is
of
mild
grainy
malt
with
just
a
touch
of
grassy
hops
the
taste
very
mild
weak
malts
and
rice
with
some
very
light
citrus
on
the
crisp
finish
it
has
a
thin
body
dry
texture
and
lively
carbonation
nothing
special
but
nothing
terrible
just
bland
and
a
bit
below
average
not
worth
it
overall
id
take
this
over
a
macro
but
not
much
else
i
like
the
can
though
although
probably
not
the
greatest
beer
around
i
would
recommend
giving
it
a
try
i
dont
mind
drinking
a
few
cans
of
this
an
odd
night
pours
a
medium
yellow
with
a
light
head
that
dissipates
very
quickly
smells
bitter
and
hoppy
but
not
exceptionally
strongly
tastes
slightly
bitter
and
dry
a
little
too
harsh
for
my
liking
feels
rather
thin
not
particularly
inspiring
reasonably
drinkable
but
not
very
good
at
all
12
ounce
bottle
maybe
ill
give
this
another
try
from
bottle
on
a
hot
summer
day
i
just
did
not
enjoy
this
beer
at
this
time
brought
2
bottles
for
proper
tasting
wish
i
only
had
to
endure
1
of
this
junk
nice
thing
is
that
the
can
is
strongthick
enough
to
stay
cold
for
some
time
since
if
fills
the
pint
glass
more
than
once
the
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
isnt
all
that
different
from
water
i
think
that
this
beer
is
over
carbonated
you
know
how
sometimes
when
you
drink
a
soda
you
get
that
burningfor
lack
of
a
better
word
sensation
in
you
nose
because
you
havent
had
something
that
carbonated
in
a
long
time
thats
what
happens
when
i
drink
this
beer
i
will
definitly
not
be
buying
this
beer
ever
again
because
this
beer
has
so
much
in
common
with
tonic
water
it
is
easy
to
drink
but
really
i
think
i
would
rather
have
plain
water
over
this
stuff
i
like
to
order
this
beer
when
im
at
a
japanese
restaurant
enjoying
sushi
its
the
type
of
beer
that
compliments
sushi
nicely
sapporo
is
not
a
beer
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
buy
when
there
are
so
many
better
options
out
there
not
a
truly
terrible
beer
but
certainly
nothing
here
to
justify
the
exorbitant
price
6500
won
salud
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
more
pours
a
very
pale
straw
yellow
with
a
respectable
white
head
that
leaves
good
lacing
the
smell
was
just
weird
the
taste
was
thankfully
funkfree
though
light
ricemalty
sweet
a
touch
of
hop
bitterness
and
little
to
no
aftertaste
fizzy
sodalike
mouthfeel
and
extremely
drinkable
pretty
good
for
what
it
is
and
a
damn
sight
better
than
its
main
japanese
competitors
better
from
the
bottle
than
from
the
can
just
another
bleh
beer
but
most
euro
pales
are
fresh
clean
light
and
simple
nothing
wrong
with
that
in
my
book
d
a
bit
pricey
much
better
beers
availiable
for
the
amount
you
must
pay
for
this
drinkability
at
650
ml
a
pop
i
dont
need
more
than
one
to
quench
my
thirst
and
i
certainly
wouldnt
bother
drinking
it
for
flavour
nothing
offensive
though
maybe
i
would
drink
it
at
a
sushi
bar
for
atmosphere
served
cold
from
a
12
oz
bottle
pours
golden
clear
with
no
precipitating
carbonation
small
whitish
head
which
fades
quickly
leaving
minimal
lacing
lemony
hopsy
nose
which
sad
to
say
is
reminiscent
of
a
corona
wheaty
flat
flavor
more
dry
than
sweet
watery
mouthfeel
no
real
aftertaste
decent
drinkability
overall
bland
and
disappointing
i
had
expected
much
more
from
this
beer
especially
for
the
price
ill
have
to
try
the
can
to
see
if
there
is
any
discernable
difference
light
bodied
actually
a
bit
watery
this
would
work
very
well
with
most
asian
cuisine
and
not
too
bad
with
barbecue
crisp
refreshing
but
better
with
food
and
ice
cold
than
by
itself
though
not
as
nasty
as
some
of
the
beer
from
asia
this
one
is
not
a
favorite
it
also
isnt
useful
by
itself
it
is
however
okay
for
washing
down
sushi
and
for
the
coolness
of
the
oilcan
perhaps
im
just
not
a
fan
of
the
style
more
drinkable
than
your
average
macro
and
still
preferable
over
bud
or
miller
products
very
pleasant
yellow
lager
color
soft
head
and
leaves
nice
lacing
in
the
glass
i
cant
really
detect
any
odor
worth
noting
this
beer
has
a
very
clean
taste
that
doesnt
interfere
with
your
meal
id
never
drink
this
without
food
just
because
this
isnt
the
kind
of
beer
youd
want
to
enjoy
by
itself
it
cant
stand
on
its
own
in
that
respect
its
great
with
sushi
or
pad
thai
actually
i
reviewed
a
big
can
not
a
bottle
had
this
at
a
local
asian
restaurant
pours
a
clear
yellow
with
minimal
head
smelling
of
corn
and
very
little
hops
tastes
like
corn
as
well
going
down
fairly
smooth
but
with
a
metallic
type
aftertaste
that
does
to
its
credit
disappear
after
a
few
minutes
the
sad
thing
is
that
i
would
choose
this
beer
over
any
american
adjuncts
not
too
bad
if
you
have
a
chaser
last
swigs
watered
down
malt
liquor
label
states
brewed
in
canada
this
is
probably
better
straight
out
of
the
bottle
nothing
to
shout
about
2
99
22
oz
tall
silver
multifaceted
can
this
really
could
pass
for
a
very
nice
german
pils
its
far
better
than
the
sapporo
reserve
i
dont
understand
how
other
reviewers
missed
the
flavor
characteristics
here
sapporo
premium
comes
in
a
22
oz
faceted
can
this
is
my
first
japanese
rice
lager
which
i
guess
is
their
equvilant
to
an
adjunct
lager
appearance
is
light
golden
in
color
with
average
head
aroma
is
very
sweet
and
full
not
a
bad
smell
for
a
macro
style
lager
taste
is
also
sweet
but
not
cloying
flavor
here
is
full
compared
to
my
expectations
this
is
pretty
drinkable
but
i
think
it
might
get
old
after
a
while
clear
golden
color
lots
of
bubbles
streaming
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
thick
white
fluffy
head
good
head
retention
very
week
adjunct
aroma
sweetness
that
i
assume
is
from
rice
very
little
malt
flavor
a
little
bitterness
to
end
with
light
body
high
carbonation
not
much
to
get
excited
about
here
i
wasnt
expecting
much
by
this
beer
and
i
expected
right
this
beer
is
nothing
special
japanese
swill
really
plain
and
not
exciting
i
guess
the
only
thing
decent
about
it
was
the
head
all
in
all
far
from
being
on
the
top
of
my
to
drink
list
however
a
good
smooth
light
beer
and
the
can
is
pretty
damned
cool
i
think
rather
boring
pale
straw
yellow
color
with
a
minimal
white
head
which
dissipates
quickly
smells
like
cheap
beer
taste
was
rather
ordinary
but
had
a
crisp
hop
bitterness
that
made
it
tolerable
mouthfeel
thin
and
watery
and
drinkability
average
the
best
thing
about
this
beer
is
the
cool
22
oz
can
a
light
beer
that
pours
out
like
water
it
has
a
thick
almost
soapy
head
that
dissipates
in
about
five
minutes
bland
taste
easily
forgettable
but
not
offensive
overall
id
rank
sapporo
premium
somewhere
in
the
lower
third
of
the
great
beer
bell
curve
not
awful
but
you
can
easily
do
better
not
a
lot
to
say
about
this
one
appearance
was
average
smell
was
rather
vague
corn
a
bit
sweet
smelling
you
could
taste
a
bit
of
hops
and
a
rather
dry
finish
some
grainy
sweetness
as
well
mouthfeel
was
bubbly
and
a
little
chewy
the
drinkability
for
me
is
not
very
high
i
just
dont
care
for
these
kind
of
beers
much
anymore
still
i
dont
think
its
that
great
a
beer
regardless
these
tasted
much
better
when
i
was
actually
in
japan
in
the
80s
must
have
been
the
novelty
of
wow
dude
im
drinkin
japanese
beer
lol
corn
aftertaste
i
had
a
22ozer
of
this
as
i
was
eating
some
tasty
sushi
and
a
filet
mignon
this
beer
pours
a
brilliantly
clear
straw
color
and
it
topped
by
a
frothy
pale
white
head
when
this
beer
first
hits
my
lips
it
has
a
spicy
almost
gingery
hotness
to
it
that
quickly
leads
to
a
sweet
grain
character
in
the
middle
of
this
beer
the
finish
is
still
sweet
with
a
bit
of
sharpness
from
the
hops
this
was
a
great
palate
refresher
in
between
bites
of
sushi
pickled
ginger
and
filet
i
must
say
that
this
beer
worked
out
quite
well
and
i
think
that
my
review
of
this
beer
reflects
the
fact
that
had
i
had
this
beer
on
its
own
i
would
not
have
enjoyed
it
nearly
as
much
this
has
got
to
be
some
sort
of
foreign
beer
but
i
think
my
can
which
read
japans
finest
was
filled
in
canada
strange
and
a
little
wrong
perhaps
but
it
hardly
detracted
from
the
drinking
experience
sapporo
pours
yellow
and
settles
ambergolden
with
a
thick
white
head
over
more
than
20
minutes
the
head
will
eventually
fade
to
whiskers
of
foam
on
the
top
of
the
beer
sapporo
premium
smells
of
sugars
caramel
and
licorice
it
starts
malty
smooth
with
a
crisp
twinge
of
bitter
hops
it
is
mediumbodied
and
sports
cream
and
slightly
wheatlike
flavors
there
is
noticable
hop
bitterness
throughout
as
it
settles
on
the
tongue
the
finish
of
this
beer
is
wet
very
malty
and
leaves
you
with
a
smooth
light
and
bitter
aftertaste
not
as
winey
tart
or
fruity
as
the
original
draft
beer
on
the
nose
it
is
reminiscent
of
cracked
sunbaked
grains
the
head
is
admirably
persistent
and
doughy
on
the
palate
whistleclean
with
simple
butterscotch
sugars
and
a
dense
dry
flank
of
seasoned
hops
good
clean
fun
japanese
beer
brewed
in
canada
and
imported
to
unsuspecting
americans
im
all
for
free
trade
but
do
you
think
that
if
no
one
drinks
this
stuff
theyll
still
ship
it
across
the
border
pours
a
medium
golden
colour
with
a
fairly
thin
fizzy
head
thats
not
around
for
very
long
the
smell
is
primarily
sweet
with
some
malt
and
grain
apparent
pretty
thin
smell
overall
nothing
dominated
and
it
was
watery
at
times
the
taste
hear
is
actually
not
bad
at
all
one
of
the
better
asian
macro
type
brews
in
terms
of
taste
there
is
a
slightly
creamy
malt
taste
with
some
sweetness
throughout
nothing
bold
overall
but
crisp
and
refreshing
was
a
decent
pairing
with
my
chinese
food
when
dining
at
asian
restarants
this
one
would
tend
to
get
the
call
as
most
around
here
only
offer
the
standard
us
macros
heineken
and
lesser
quality
asian
brews
such
as
tsingtao
and
kirin
this
pours
a
very
pale
gold
with
a
whiffy
white
head
the
aroma
is
slightly
citrusy
and
i
have
to
admit
its
pretty
appealing
the
flavor
is
very
dry
and
absolutely
no
aftertaste
you
taste
it
when
its
there
but
when
you
swallow
all
flavor
is
gone
its
bizarre
its
got
a
little
bit
of
hoppiness
to
it
overall
a
decent
beer
not
one
i
would
go
out
and
make
a
point
to
buy
but
i
would
have
it
if
i
am
at
a
japanese
restaraunt
and
they
are
selling
it
oelergud
if
presented
with
a
choice
between
this
and
kirin
however
take
this
it
at
least
has
a
unique
taste
not
bad
reminds
me
of
a
couple
of
the
polish
lagers
not
much
flavor
but
crisp
and
clean
none
of
the
macrosweetness
you
find
in
u
s
macros
and
their
many
imitators
nice
appearance
with
a
foamy
head
and
lacing
that
lasts
not
too
pale
worth
trying
probably
good
with
spicy
food
very
drinkable
i
suspect
that
this
would
have
higher
scores
if
consumed
with
sushi
japenese
beer
brewed
in
guelph
ontario
this
golden
lager
poured
a
decent
head
the
smell
is
kind
of
funky
not
sure
what
ingriedients
are
used
but
rice
must
be
one
the
taste
is
about
equally
as
funky
with
a
very
strange
taste
not
an
overly
drinkable
beer
and
not
one
to
seek
out
about
the
only
good
thing
about
beers
like
this
one
is
that
you
dont
remember
them
and
you
can
use
those
brain
cells
for
something
else
bought
in
a
time
pinch
at
a
take
out
sushi
place
will
try
to
do
better
next
time
no
nose
highly
carbonated
skunky
minimal
flavor
watery
corn
rice
brewed
in
canada
according
to
the
can
ok
for
a
very
hot
day
when
you
can
find
nothing
else
in
the
fridge
no
reason
to
consume
more
of
this
one
budweiser
with
a
japanese
twist
it
poured
a
clear
golden
color
with
little
head
the
smell
was
skunky
with
the
faint
scent
of
hops
the
taste
was
watered
down
but
i
did
get
a
grainy
hops
taste
in
it
like
i
said
before
it
seemed
very
watered
down
it
had
little
to
offer
this
beer
poured
a
pale
yellowlight
gold
color
that
was
crystal
clear
and
well
carbonated
the
head
that
was
produced
was
pure
white
in
color
and
had
the
consistency
of
a
fluffy
cloud
and
seemed
to
last
quite
some
time
until
it
fell
to
a
ring
on
the
edges
the
lace
that
was
created
was
fairly
detailed
a
good
way
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
the
aromas
that
came
from
the
glass
were
fairly
faint
but
i
could
detect
some
sweet
malt
faint
fruit
hops
and
a
kind
of
corn
grain
the
aroma
reminded
me
of
miller
products
light
to
be
exact
the
tastes
were
also
kind
of
weak
hops
husks
malt
grains
and
a
hint
of
pine
were
all
i
tasted
as
it
warmed
considerably
i
noticed
some
light
fruit
come
out
the
aftertaste
was
just
as
faint
some
pine
or
hops
were
just
about
it
and
they
did
not
last
long
the
body
was
light
kind
of
watery
on
the
tongue
and
over
all
very
average
at
best
the
bottle
and
logo
seemed
to
be
the
best
part
of
this
beer
pours
yellow
with
minimal
headbut
very
good
lace
lots
of
carbonation
very
light
aroma
minor
citric
hop
notes
and
faint
crystal
malt
aroma
taste
is
virtually
nonexistent
starts
with
faint
malt
but
never
goes
anywhere
nothing
more
than
a
hint
of
bitterness
minor
spice
pretty
bland
my
guess
its
brewed
with
a
lot
of
adjuncts
ah
the
nectar
of
the
samurai
bubbly
straw
yellow
with
a
poofy
white
head
smells
of
sweet
grains
and
big
rusty
hops
tastes
of
clean
light
rice
and
barley
hops
start
big
but
then
fade
into
almost
nothing
finish
is
slightly
bitter
i
also
detected
some
weird
almost
fruity
rubbing
alcohol
notes
sake
just
kidding
not
bad
but
im
still
not
a
huge
asian
lager
fan
pours
a
pale
golden
colour
topped
by
a
small
head
that
settles
down
quite
easily
not
a
bad
pilsner
bad
i
found
it
much
more
bitter
in
the
taste
than
other
pilsners
aroma
is
dominated
by
malts
leave
the
beer
for
couple
of
seconds
in
your
mouth
before
swallowing
you
will
feel
the
bitterness
of
the
beer
on
your
taste
buds
goes
down
quite
easily
not
a
bad
pilsner
got
a
16oz
bottle
at
a
japanese
hibachi
style
restaurant
went
nicely
with
teryaki
steak
and
shrimp
alone
it
didnt
really
measure
up
with
slight
corn
aroma
and
taste
fizzy
yellow
stuff
to
be
sure
but
the
food
softened
the
blow
the
beer
quenched
the
thirst
and
a
good
time
was
had
by
all
a
pretty
easy
drinking
lager
certainly
better
than
most
american
and
canadian
macros
but
not
great
light
gold
color
medium
head
a
light
bodied
lager
style
beer
light
malts
but
fairly
hoppy
smooth
clean
taste
full
flavored
mouthfeel
is
full
and
round
finish
is
clean
and
smooth
finish
is
slightly
bitter
nice
refreshing
draft
beer
fresh
tasting
despite
being
canned
both
the
smell
and
taste
is
crisp
but
vacant
i
guess
this
might
be
o
k
with
sushi
or
some
other
food
but
i
would
opt
for
saki
instead
altogether
a
very
clean
and
crisp
beer
that
is
refreshing
even
though
it
is
somewhat
lacking
in
flavor
ive
yet
to
have
sushi
but
that
is
something
that
i
hope
to
remedy
soon
and
when
i
do
ill
probably
have
a
sapporo
with
it
a
decent
macro
import
cleansing
if
nothing
else
taste
is
alright
and
pretty
much
nonoffensive
still
at
6
a
bottle
i
felt
robbed
besides
the
headache
i
got
later
that
night
presumably
from
the
beer
didnt
help
either
came
in
a
brown
600ml
bottle
my
thoughts
are
this
is
just
a
slightly
modified
version
of
sapporo
draft
with
a
shiny
gold
label
pours
out
a
pale
clear
straw
and
a
pretty
impressive
head
the
head
manages
to
stick
around
more
than
halfway
down
the
glass
to
my
surprise
and
leaves
a
decent
lace
nose
is
mild
with
some
sweet
malt
and
only
a
hint
of
floral
hops
flavour
is
dry
vaguely
sweet
with
a
mild
hoppy
finish
nice
full
mouthfeel
for
such
a
pale
lager
though
id
order
this
one
with
sushi
rather
than
the
draft
pours
a
crystal
clear
golden
color
with
a
bubbly
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
despite
the
constant
stream
of
carbonation
bubbling
up
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
pretty
weak
aroma
light
grainy
malt
with
a
hint
of
toast
and
a
mild
sweetness
taste
is
grainy
toasty
and
sweet
just
like
the
aroma
promised
finish
is
fairly
dry
but
leaves
a
lingering
sweetness
on
the
tongue
spirited
level
of
carbonation
light
body
with
a
lightly
sweet
bubbly
mouthfeel
really
nothing
special
or
objectionable
its
not
bad
in
fact
i
have
had
macros
that
are
much
worse
i
could
drink
this
if
i
had
to
nose
is
metal
corn
barny
malts
taste
is
similar
with
a
bit
more
malt
and
some
odd
turpentiney
ethanol
these
are
just
mild
tastes
its
mostly
another
macro
lager
not
sure
what
makes
this
the
special
winters
edition
note
to
self
avoid
all
canned
japanese
beers
not
much
too
get
excited
about
here
even
for
a
mass
market
japanese
beer
while
the
autumn
seasonals
at
least
attempt
to
mimic
oktoberfest
beers
i
have
no
idea
what
the
inspiration
for
fuyumonogatari
is
supposed
to
be
and
it
hardly
distinguishes
itself
from
the
many
other
bland
lagers
available
in
japan
drinkablity
a
good
brew
it
was
refreshing
and
satisfying
i
am
still
getting
used
to
the
japanese
winter
brews
they
do
not
seem
to
be
too
much
of
a
departure
from
their
regular
brews
drinkability
this
does
get
a
bit
sweet
after
a
while
but
its
pretty
drinkable
nonetheless
a
welcome
addition
to
the
shelves
of
my
local
7eleven
20062007
limited
edition
can
nice
looking
can
smells
like
basically
nothing
at
all
decent
amber
color
considering
the
style
taste
is
a
bit
metally
bit
of
an
unpleasantly
bitter
afterbite
generally
a
step
down
from
the
usual
japanese
rice
lager
nice
can
though
this
beer
is
getting
exceptionally
low
marks
bc
i
really
think
its
not
so
good
japanese
beer
companies
like
to
put
out
new
happoshu
every
once
in
a
while
and
this
is
their
winter
brew
its
all
image
though
this
beer
really
blows
its
a
little
crisp
on
the
onset
but
theres
really
nothing
nothing
to
this
beer
its
even
got
a
strange
processed
taste
which
musters
up
memories
of
nasty
cheap
beer
available
in
the
us
anyone
can
tell
its
a
lousy
brew
even
japanese
people
ive
drunk
it
with
id
rather
drink
natty
anyday
the
can
is
cool
though
w
a
nice
image
of
the
sapporo
beer
factory
in
sapporo
japan
like
i
said
all
image
exp
june
2003
notes
named
for
william
shakespeares
poem
this
beer
is
nothing
special
nor
does
it
live
up
to
sapporos
other
stout
draft
beers
not
to
be
confused
with
the
actual
stout
style
of
beer
not
worth
spending
a
whole
lot
of
time
talking
about
next
beer
drinkablity
tasty
brew
i
am
glad
to
see
fresh
hop
brews
here
in
japan
even
if
they
have
milder
hop
profiles
than
fresh
hop
brews
from
the
west
coast
overall
i
am
generally
not
a
fan
of
lagers
but
this
one
is
my
favorite
so
far
primarily
because
i
can
actually
taste
it
it
has
more
malt
flavor
bitterness
and
body
than
something
like
stella
or
bud
light
its
still
too
bland
for
me
to
drink
on
its
own
but
goes
well
with
sushi
the
right
tool
for
the
right
job
i
drank
this
beer
before
and
during
dinner
at
a
sushi
restaurant
it
was
a
nice
compliment
to
sushi
i
tried
this
beer
out
of
a
22oz
can
its
pour
resulted
in
a
low
shortlived
head
and
had
low
carbonation
overall
the
aroma
was
light
crisp
and
slightly
skunky
it
consisted
of
a
light
clean
and
crisp
taste
but
was
distinctly
light
and
clean
better
than
an
average
american
pale
lager
i
enjoyed
the
difference
in
the
quality
of
this
beer
in
comparison
to
other
pale
lagers
despite
my
enjoyment
it
wasnt
anything
extraordinary
it
was
a
nice
new
experience
but
an
average
beer
nonetheless
japans
budweiser
pours
a
light
gold
color
with
a
slight
fizzy
head
smell
is
of
a
slightly
sweet
carbonated
starchiness
mostly
what
you
would
expect
from
a
basic
lager
obviously
pairs
well
with
a
nice
japanese
bento
box
very
easy
to
drink
thanks
to
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
and
an
overall
freshness
finishes
dry
solid
beer
i
used
to
have
an
old
alcoholic
roomate
who
loved
this
stuff
he
had
me
try
it
once
and
by
god
it
was
fantastic
it
could
have
been
the
atmosphere
since
we
took
our
girlfriends
out
to
a
sushi
bar
and
the
beer
looked
and
tasted
so
great
it
could
have
been
a
culmination
of
the
whole
pleasantness
of
the
entire
situation
great
beer
tho
regaurdless
after
trying
it
several
more
times
in
several
different
types
never
thought
japan
would
make
a
great
beer
especially
one
made
from
rice
httpabarwithnoname
wordpress
com
this
was
surprisingly
available
at
a
high
end
oriental
grill
in
new
delhi
expensive
but
i
had
to
try
it
with
the
food
poured
from
a
can
into
a
pilsener
glass
fell
a
light
bronze
colour
with
plenty
of
effervescence
and
life
the
head
was
gone
before
i
could
blink
smell
was
all
grain
a
little
pils
malt
and
a
faint
herbaceous
the
sip
was
stingy
on
the
tongue
that
was
the
near
metallic
carbonation
at
work
tasted
of
wet
grain
a
faint
shadow
of
malt
sweetness
and
a
near
leafy
bitterness
very
shortlived
on
the
palate
frankly
i
would
prefer
asahi
super
dry
any
day
the
only
noticeable
aspect
is
the
carbonation
and
the
fact
that
it
washes
down
the
oriental
spices
rather
well
dont
expect
anything
more
from
this
one
the
best
part
about
this
beer
was
that
it
came
in
a
4oz
can
size
i
wouldnt
wish
this
one
on
any
other
ba
for
the
love
of
god
pass
on
this
its
straw
yellow
not
bitter
light
head
that
fades
quickly
decent
o
not
an
amazing
beer
but
its
easy
to
drink
especially
with
a
typical
japanese
meals
the
look
is
very
light
and
fizzy
not
much
aroma
to
speak
of
overall
an
ok
tasting
beer
which
can
be
refreshing
but
not
a
real
standout
in
my
mind
there
is
good
thirst
quenching
quality
here
very
refreshing
high
drinkable
and
good
to
have
more
than
one
in
row
cool
tall
silver
can
poured
this
beersan
into
my
glass
with
not
much
to
offer
to
the
eyes
save
for
a
different
color
than
the
glass
smelled
like
most
massproduced
lagers
not
surprising
since
the
rice
thing
is
a
similarity
flavor
was
decent
but
nothing
different
from
the
decent
megaschlubs
of
yore
might
be
a
bit
more
carbonation
here
than
what
im
used
to
getting
in
an
bud
but
thats
about
it
what
i
did
like
about
this
is
that
its
very
drinkable
and
would
go
well
with
that
wasabi
you
had
with
your
sea
urchin
now
i
know
its
making
everyone
hungry
grassy

slight

very

this
is
a
fairly
basic
but
solid
easy
drinking
beer
maybe
it
is
all
those
sushi
nights
and
sakebombs
that
make
me
think
so
fondly
of
this
beer
but
it
just
seems
to
have
an
extra
quality
over
many
other
similar
such
pale
lagers
d
good
drinker
only
if
it
is
served
fresh
ontap
seems
to
go
best
with
japanese
food
will
do
in
a
pinch
by
itself
not
something
i
will
have
again
most
likely
poured
lightly
for
a
1finger
head
reduces
to
thin
bubbly
head
runny
and
blotchy
color

is

beers
12
oz
bottle
in
japanese
restaurant
pours
a
pale
straw
with
a
quickly
fading
white
head
aroma
is
of
grass
some
hops
and
sweet
malt
flavor
is
light
hops
with
some
biscuit
malt
finish
is
not
existent
body
is
watery
at
least
it
was
not
disgusting
in
my
opinion
this
is
one
of
he
most
overrated
beers
in
the
world
it
has
such
a
strong
bitter
taste
and
tastes
so
dry
it
is
very
watered
down
has
a
poor
color
way
too
much
carbonationand
leaves
a
horrible
aftertaste
this
beer
is
the
jap
equivalent
of
budweiser
bottled
or
in
cans
meh
not
so
good
but
ba
doesnt
seem
to
make
that
distinction
very
well
d
extremely
drinkable
but
not
worth
drinking
if
something
else
available
drinkability
4
out
of
5
as
with
most
beers
on
the
light
end
of
the
spectrum
sapporos
drinkability
is
its
highlight
it
is
a
bit
more
balanced
and
more
drinkable
than
things
like
miller
high
life
or
pabst
blue
ribbon
but
it
is
also
a
little
more
expensive
considering
the
fact
that
it
has
been
imported
if
youre
an
rabid
anime
fan
or
japanophile
this
is
an
ideal
beer
to
prove
how
obsessed
you
are
othewise
i
suggest
opting
for
a
domestic
equivalent
on
the
other
hand
taking
its
japanese
origins
into
account
sapporo
is
light
and
subtle
enough
to
compliment
fairly
delicate
foods
like
sushi
without
overpowering
the
flavors
as
stronger
more
blatantlyflavored
beers
might
taste
not
much
you
could
workout
and
drink
this
stuff
carbonated
good
with
good
food
because
it
wont
interfere
with
just
about
any
flavor
profile
very
polite
and
non
offensive
beer
here
just
missing
the
camera
prolly
good
with
spicy
stuff
or
when
you
just
feel
like
a
water
but
it
isnt
available
this
used
to
be
cheaper
price
has
crept
up
lately
overall
a
decent
beer
but
pretty
indistinguishable
from
any
other
japanese
beer
poured
from
a
2
liter
can
has
a
rich
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
very
mild
slight
grains
taste
is
crisp
not
very
flavorful
mild
notes
of
grains
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
has
decent
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
mediocre
beer
drinkable
just
not
complex
fine
with
sushi
as
it
doesnt
get
in
the
way
of
the
delicate
flavors
but
obviously
not
one
to
grab
when
you
are
on
the
mood
for
a
bold
craft
beer
pours
a
straw
yellow
color
with
a
one
and
a
half
finger
head
to
it
the
smell
is
of
a
rice
grain
backbone
however
there
is
a
little
sweet
smell
as
well
the
taste
is
of
rice
grain
and
a
slight
sweet
malt
as
well
as
a
slight
citrus
hop
the
mouthfeel
is
of
moderate
carbonation
overall
it
is
a
drinkable
beer
it
is
slightly
more
flavorful
and
complex
than
the
regular
version
but
still
not
enough
to
make
you
crave
it
but
its
very
drinkable
had
like
4
in
a
row
i
just
had
to
ignore
the
smell
and
the
taste
the
sushi
was
delicious
though
ddrinkable
it
is
a
session
beer
one
that
is
easy
to
drink
but
doesnt
pack
a
lot
of
complex
flavors
this
way
the
taste
doesnt
get
to
overwhelming
after
a
few
the
lack
of
hop
is
disappointing
but
expected
thin
bodied
highly
carbonated
yep
get
out
the
lawn
mower
work
up
a
sweat
and
down
this
in
seconds
then
you
might
find
it
satisfying
drinkability
a
refreshing
crisp
lager
thats
fine
for
asian
restaurant
drinking
particularly
if
sake
bombs
are
called
for
as
japanese
beers
go
this
one
deserves
if
not
a
significantly
better
review
at
least
a
more
favorable
one
compared
with
the
readily
available
varieties
of
japanese
rice
lager
here
in
the
us
this
one
stands
out
as
having
at
least
some
quality
in
taste
and
body
golden
slightly
grayish
color
in
the
glass
with
a
nice
head
of
foam
that
fell
quickly
a
bit
watery
as
expected
and
bubbly
it
was
nonetheless
refreshing
and
drinkable
the
taste
was
malty
with
a
rice
smoothness
and
a
hint
of
hops
that
adds
a
very
subtle
spicy
edge
to
the
aftertaste
this
beer
reminds
me
of
sapporo
premium
in
fact
i
cant
come
up
with
any
discernable
differences
it
is
a
pale
straw
color
with
a
weak
beige
head
the
nose
and
taste
are
both
ricey
and
a
bit
skunky
a
light
boddy
has
more
than
ample
carbonation
and
does
not
go
down
well
not
much
one
can
say
about
this
beer
except
its
malty
sweet
and
goes
down
easy
with
sushi
has
a
nice
good
white
head
a
gold
color
has
a
relatively
boring
taste
which
makes
a
good
palliate
cleaner
for
sushi
has
a
grass
smell
with
lite
floral
taste
not
bad
beer
by
any
stretch
and
easily
drinkable
cant
say
much
about
it
but
it
would
be
good
to
have
on
a
hot
day
its
light
in
colour
and
taste
reminded
me
of
miller
lite
probably
would
not
have
it
again
drinkability
not
a
great
brew
by
any
means
but
easy
to
drink
in
a
mindless
refreshing
way
near
the
top
of
my
list
among
the
massproduced
japanese
nonpremium
lagers
even
with
a
sake
shot
glass
dropped
into
it
just
not
a
fun
beer
avoid
i
rated
this
one
in
the
mindset
of
thinking
that
budweiser
and
michelob
are
made
of
rice
shouldnt
they
be
considered
rice
lagers
i
would
have
to
say
that
if
i
measure
this
beer
up
to
budweiser
there
is
no
contest
sapporo
brings
home
the
trophy
at
least
i
understand
why
they
use
rice
does
japan
have
any
other
grains
all
in
all
its
not
a
bad
lager
even
matching
it
up
against
heineken
i
would
say
sapporo
wins
drinkability
bière
correcte
dans
le
style
des
pilsener
allemandes
im
partial
to
ales
so
consequently
i
was
surprised
that
this
was
better
than
anticipated
smooth
and
drinkable
and
not
overcarbonated
like
american
pale
lagers
nothing
spectacular
but
not
heinous
like
american
macrobrews
aroma
was
almost
undetectable
and
lacing
was
minimal
nice
can
pours
with
a
yellowish
wheat
color
and
a
tall
foamy
head
with
not
much
lacing
smells
like
generic
beer
but
doesnt
have
any
skunk
which
is
good
taste
was
light
bubbly
with
slight
wheats
mouthfeel
is
pretty
smooth
actually
and
i
was
expecting
skunk
at
each
level
but
did
not
detect
it
a
good
beer
to
just
down
when
youve
had
too
much
wasabi
pours
an
extremely
pale
yellow
with
a
light
amount
of
foam
on
top
plenty
of
carbonation
keeps
the
foam
intact
the
head
did
not
disipate
even
after
the
beer
was
gone
smell
is
a
bit
like
raw
grain
husks
with
some
floral
aromas
as
well
taste
is
rather
simple
a
bit
of
a
dry
bread
and
cracker
taste
some
floral
notes
afterwards
and
even
a
small
amount
of
vanilla
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
too
carbonated
gave
my
throat
a
prickly
sensation
and
left
me
with
a
bit
of
gas
however
its
quite
refreshing
a
decent
session
beer
for
what
it
is
a
simple
thirst
quenching
lager
its
quite
good
worth
a
shot
pours
a
very
light
straw
color
with
chunky
white
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
while
but
eventually
fades
away
to
form
a
thin
chunky
layer
that
laces
the
glass
really
doesnt
have
any
smell
to
it
at
all
the
flavor
was
slightly
tinny
from
the
can
even
though
i
poured
it
into
a
pilsner
glass
to
review
it
other
than
that
its
very
clean
and
creamy
no
real
aftertaste
its
a
very
nice
lawnmower
beer
and
possibly
very
good
with
sushi
ill
have
to
try
that
soon
an
allaround
very
drinkable
beer
not
every
going
to
be
a
regular
but
i
do
have
some
of
the
old
bumpy
22
oz
bottles
from
some
time
ago
that
i
like
to
use
for
home
brew
enjoyed
this
beer
recommended
cheers
poured
a
light
gold
bright
and
inviting
leaving
a
thin
white
lace
the
aroma
is
sweet
fresh
hard
to
breakdown
sort
of
plain
some
yeasty
essence
throughout
the
taste
starts
crisp
dry
and
actually
nice
it
has
a
small
hop
bitterness
upfront
followed
by
a
malty
sweetness
that
dominates
the
finish
with
a
lemon
tart
bite
overall
this
is
a
pretty
decent
brew
which
i
accompanied
with
some
sushi
the
perfect
pair
taste
was
malty
and
dry
absolutely
not
bitter
the
thin
body
and
high
drinkability
make
this
a
straight
forward
pilsener
perfect
to
accompany
an
asian
dish
yet
it
is
not
uo
there
with
the
top
10
pilseners
the
mouthfeel
is
very
crisp
and
light
quite
cleansing
quite
pleasant
overall
though
not
a
style
i
enjoy
though
seem
to
have
frequently
enough
this
beer
is
what
it
is
supposed
to
be
quite
drinkable
in
the
right
environment
e
g
japanese
restaurant
sapporo
draft
beer
pours
a
hazy
chill
haze
most
likely
as
it
is
a
filtered
beer
light
orange
with
a
white
head
that
dissipated
quickly
from
a
brown
sixteen
ounce
bottle
no
freshness
date
on
the
bottle
and
im
a
little
suspicious
about
its
age
a
little
bit
of
malt
and
maybe
a
little
alcohol
in
the
aroma
taste
is
on
the
malty
side
and
a
bit
of
skunk
in
the
finish
this
beer
is
actually
better
than
i
remembered
it
that
being
said
its
nothing
special
maybe
a
change
from
the
norm
but
not
worth
seeking
out
drinkability
very
good
with
a
hearty
meal
in
front
of
you
as
japanese
beers
go
its
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
tried
however
its
only
marginally
more
enjoyable
than
a
standard
macrolager
a
rather
well
made
japanese
rice
lager
looks
standard
rice
lager
golden
decent
head
sticks
around
for
a
few
minutes
even
leaves
a
little
lacing
the
smell
is
what
separates
this
from
asahi
and
kirin
you
can
actually
smell
it
from
a
little
distance
and
its
not
bad
typical
macro
lager
scents
malty
but
more
complex
than
the
others
i
swear
i
detect
some
toastiness
and
even
a
hint
of
pear
tastes
pretty
watery
and
plain
up
front
but
with
a
pleasant
little
bitter
finish
making
this
quite
drinkable
ill
take
yebisu
over
this
for
a
session
beer
but
this
might
be
better
with
food
a
beer

remember

recommended
try
too
with

and
snack
overall
this
is
my
new
favorite
drinking
beer
for
japan
although
i
usually
only
see
it
in
cans
not
bars
i
have
many
nostalgic
memories
associated
with
this
beer
it
evokes
many
trips
to
the
oregon
coast
near
tillamook
where
my
wife
and
i
would
stop
at
the
blue
heron
and
pick
up
some
cheese
crackers
fruit
and
sapporo
draft

and
then
go
sit
by
the
ocean
for
a
picnic
the
appearance
is
translucent
pale
and
golden
foam
and
lacing
are
excellent
aroma
is

with
some

a

pilsnerlike
gold
color
head

carbonation
is

taste
is

a
very
light
bodied
beer
with
minimal
hop
flavoring
sweet
taste
is
prevalent
and
carbonation
is
evident
but
nothing
really
interesting
going
on
here
just
as
drinkable
as
any
other
adjunct
beer
i
would
skip
this
one
if
i
was
offered
it
again
meantime
stick
to
sapporo
black
beer
smells
like
a
box
of
chocolates
or
if
you
favor
a
dortmunder
try
sapporos
yebisu
if
smaller
new
generation
japanese
brewers
get
swallowed
up
as
is
the
trend
in
us
this
brewer
could
provide
some
beer
that
we
all
will
advocate
starts
a
bit
mild
but
then
a
goodly
amount
of
dms
and
musty
hops
grabs
your
tongue
and
holds
on
some
sweetness
and
slight
sourness
theres
enough
carbonation
that
you
can
almost
taste
it
that
musty
bitterness
lingers
on
the
tongue
long
after
youre
done
the
dms
and
mustiness
is
just
too
much
for
me
to
detect
anything
else
there
overall
a
delicious
drinkable
beer
very
good
compliment
to
a
koroke
teishoku
lunch
can
poured
a
clear
golden
colored
beer
with
a
pretty
decent
head
with
standard
retention
aroma
is
very
weak
almost
watery
i
should
say
taste
is
also
quite
watery
and
boring
i
guess
it
would
go
well
with
the
kind
of
spicy
food
where
you
loose
all
your
taste
buds
taste
is
even
worse
when
i
notice
that
this
is
brewed
by
sleeman
at
their
guelph
facility
not
a
bad
offering
for
an
import
lager
pours
a
light
golden
yellow
with
a
little
white
head
that
retains
farely
well
lacing
isnt
to
bad
either
the
smell
is
very
grainy
with
hints
of
corn
slight
skunk
aroma
as
well
the
taste
is
earthy
heavy
grain
and
corn
with
a
slight
citrus
some
french
bread
aftertaste
slight
syrupy
malts
brings
a
little
bit
of
flavor
to
this
feels
crisp
and
medium
in
the
mouth
not
bad
average
light
and
pleasant
to
the
taste
if
undistinguished
crisp
and
leaves
the
palate
quickly
this
is
a
decent
brew
with
or
without
sake
particularly
for
the
hot
summer
months
light
enough
to
refresh
without
stupefying
pours
with
a
big
white
head
the
color
was
a
clean
bright
yellow
for
the
most
part
the
only
aroma
i
could
pinpoint
was
a
sweet
grassy
smell
a
very
watery
flavor
no
real
sweetness
as
indicated
in
the
aroma
just
a
light
crisp
bitterness
on
the
finish
it
is
quite
possible
that
if
served
ice
cold
on
a
good
hot
day
this
beer
could
be
refreshing
comes
in
a
bad
ass
can
pours
out
a
pale
golden
clear
with
a
big
white
head
somewhat
rocky
and
it
eventually
dies
down
to
a
foamy
white
ring
light
lacing
the
nose
smells
of
sweet
grainy
malt
very
clean
the
flavor
is
in
the
same
arena
light
sweetness
comming
from
the
malt
with
a
small
hop
bitterness
evening
things
out
clean
and
simple
crisp
in
the
mouth
and
refreshing
a
nice
palate
cleanser
spicy
food
pizza
thai
food
etc
or
a
good
ice
cold
quencher
i
expected
less
not
bad
at
all
i
had
this
at
the
local
japanese
restaraunt
poured
a
golden
straw
color
with
a
white
head
aroma
is
very
clean
cant
really
pick
out
much
grain
or
much
of
anything
for
that
matter
taste
is
what
the
smell
alluded
to
very
crisp
faint
notes
of
hops
are
present
but
thats
about
it
this
fits
in
well
with
the
bmc
crowd
nothing
special
overall
but
i
was
glad
to
try
something
new
and
my
first
asian
beer
as
well
i
would
say
that
its
the
japanese
equivilant
to
budweiser
or
coors
it
is
a
pale
yell
ow
colour
with
no
head
smell
husky
and
corny
there
was
no
trace
of
hops
in
either
the
taste
or
aroma
i
was
pissed
that
it
was
getting
skunky
in
the
short
time
it
took
me
to
drink
it
drinkability

im
not
dumping
this
in
the
sink
as
i
do
with
many
examples
of
this
sadly
wornout
style
japanese
bud
really
went
out
to
hibachi
last
night
with
friends
the
food
was
great
but
expensive
the
beer
was
lackluster
and
even
more
expensive
when
in
rome
do
as
the
romans
so
i
ordered
a
sapporo
cool
looking
can
a
bomber
or
more
i
believe
of
course
i
poured
into
a
pilsner
glass
but
nothing
special
here
at
all
it
really
did
taste
exactly
like
bud
maybe
even
a
little
lighter
with
no
malt
backbone
at
all
the
mouthfeel
did
cut
through
some
of
the
vegetable
and
shrimp
aromas
from
the
meal
and
it
was
nice
to
have
something
light
for
this
meal
but
not
worth
the
money
i
would
never
buy
this
for
home
use
if
you
do
go
to
hibachi
save
your
cash
and
get
a
bud
draft
it
is
drinkable
and
probably
is
pretty
optimum
for
sushi
but
i
like
mixing
a
little
soy
sauce
and
wasabi
in
a
small
amount
of
a
good
doppelbock
and
dipping
my
sushi
in
that
of
course
i
might
be
a
bit
weird
nothing
amazing
about
sapporo
draft
better
than
a
normal
american
macro
and
it
would
certainly
go
nicely
with
spicy
asian
food
not
much
to
say
beyond
that
thick
bubbly
head
that
dispates
quickly
this
a
pale
golden
color
and
smells
of
grains
and
a
slight
floral
hint
the
taste
is
grainy
with
a
crisp
taste
that
bites
your
tongue
this
pricks
the
palate
not
a
bad
blend
of
ingrediants
would
go
well
with
spicy
asian
foods
still
not
something
i
could
sit
back
and
enjoy
regularly
cold
filtered
draft
low
aroma
flavor
it
pours
a
clear
gold
with
a
fizzy
white
head
the
aroma
is
much
like
a
distant
slice
of
wonder
bread
the
lightmedium
body
is
slightly
grainy
and
a
little
sweet
but
otherwise
nondescript
this
brew
is
lacking
in
the
hop
department
a
seltzery
fizzy
mouthfeel
is
used
in
place
of
any
hop
flavors
bottled
not
draft
but
despite
all
its
drawbacks
it
is
fairly
drinkable
clear
as
day
with
a
yellow
tint
it
almost
looks
like
champagne
the
taste
is
extremely
crisp
and
dry
it
complemented
the
meal
very
well
i
could
have
gone
for
another
one
of
these
when
i
was
done
and
ill
certainly
take
it
over
bud
any
day
nothing
too
special
i
would
drink
it
again
but
i
wouldnt
care
to
buy
it
again
my
guess
is
it
complements
japanese
food
and
if
anything
else
it
would
be
an
effective
method
of
washing
down
wasabi
standard
macro
yellow
w
white
head
however
this
is
definitely
a
cut
above
the
rest
i
actually
could
taste
some
malt
and
hops
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
certainly
better
than
buttwiper
pours
a
normal
and
boring
yellow
color
the
aroma
is
the
same
boring
and
not
very
strong
showing
that
it
is
a
massproduced
beverage
everything
is
very
much
like
bud
light
including
the
taste
nothing
special
here
but
a
fairly
drinkable
beer
think
expensive
bud
light
this
beer
poured
a
very
quick
dissolving
head
and
there
was
no
lacing
whatsoever
it
had
a
moderate
bitter
taste
the
body
had
a
lot
of
carbonation
and
the
hue
was
gold
a
very
prolonging
aftertaste
was
observed
with
this
beer
this
beer
reminded
me
of
budweiser
yuck
this
brew
poured
from
a
can
yielded
a
small
white
head
of
fine
to
medium
sized
bubbles
with
little
lacing
it
had
a
transparent
light
yellow
orange
body
and
a
typical
american
beer
like
aroma
with
a
mild
malt
and
a
mild
hoppy
smell
carbonation
continuously
rose
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
it
had
a
fizzy
taste
of
hops
and
went
down
fairly
smoothly
but
i
could
feel
the
gas
building
in
my
stomach
after
only
a
few
sips
it
was
very
much
like
a
typical
big
american
brewery
beer
like
bud
or
miller
well
i
guess
we
taught
the
japs
everything
we
know
12
oz
bottle
poured
a
very
light
yellow
not
much
head
or
lacing
aroma
is
muted
but
there
is
a
slight
hint
of
malt
the
taste
is
light
slightly
sweet
with
no
hop
presence
still
it
is
quite
drinkable
just
as
i
remember
it
when
i
was
in
japan
in
the
mid
80s
nothing
like
those
street
corner
beer
vending
machines
thx
drink
when
cold
as
this
beer
looses
zip
as
it
warms
fairly
easy
to
drink
but
i
would
recommend
12
oz
bottles
so
the
beer
doesnt
warm
allinall
not
a
bad
beer
with
the
appropriate
food
but
not
one
to
really
enjoy
on
its
own
not
a
bad
japanese
beer
i
liked
it
better
than
the
yebisu
i
had
just
before
this
one
clear
golden
very
little
head
but
tasted
fresh
like
n
american
lager
highly
carbonated
and
not
a
beer
id
drink
often
fine
with
dinner
though
and
a
good
aid
to
spicy
japanese
food
pours
a
nice
head
but
it
is
gone
very
fast
looks
a
pale
golden
yellow
smells
pretty
wheaty
surprisingly
tastes
a
little
wheaty
too
crisp
and
clean
a
good
light
beer
smooth
but
spicy
enough
to
keep
it
interesting
and
make
it
drinkable
better
than
most
beers
in
its
class
an
average
cheap
eurolager
tasting
beer
nice
if
it
is
all
you
can
getusually
at
asianjapanese
resaurants
it
will
get
the
job
done
if
the
alternative
is
budweiser
just
order
a
glass
of
water
to
go
with
it
smells
like
cheap
grain
and
slightly
skunked
noble
hops
pours
to
a
frothy
sudsy
head
that
dissapears
rapidly
has
a
flavor
thats
grainyadjuncty
with
a
sharp
hoppiness
and
puckering
dryness
mouthfeel
is
unimpressive
and
thin
very
easy
to
drink
however
it
has
a
disturbingly
ultradry
finish
a
chalky
dusty
feeling
was
left
in
my
throat
after
i
finished
it
when
they
said
this
beer
is
dry
they
were
not
messing
around
not
a
good
sign
when
a
beer
leaves
you
parched
and
wanting
a
glass
of
water
color
is
a
pale
clear
yellow
with
a
white
head
of
foam
that
faded
fast
leaving
some
smallish
bubbly
lacing
smells
faintly
of
sweetish
malt
and
grain
of
bread
or
cornbread
with
barely
a
hop
in
the
back
taste
is
crisp
and
grainy
with
a
slight
sweet
cornbread
taste
thats
smooth
and
easy
theres
a
little
hop
in
the
back
but
hardly
noticeable
unless
a
big
swig
is
taken
from
your
glass
this
is
a
ok
drinker
nothing
outstanding
a
bit
airy
and
watery
thinned
out
and
could
use
some
body
and
flavor
clear
yellow
with
a
voluminous
white
head
this
created
a
fair
amount
of
lacing
down
the
glass
the
taste
was
rather
weak
and
watery
with
a
sense
of
breadiness
and
grain
not
a
bad
beer
rather
innocuous
overall
this
lager
seems
more
like
a
macro
american
beer
than
anything
else
golden
in
color
with
the
matching
white
foam
that
i
will
call
a
head
definitely
fizzy
white
it
is
a
basic
macro
although
i
find
that
this
beer
does
pair
well
with
the
japanese
food
when
poured
you
can
almost
smell
the
corn
and
rice
mostly
rice
come
at
you
all
rice
minimal
malt
almost
unnoticable
hop
aroma
a
simple
very
low
in
flavor
carbonated
beverage
but
it
is
refreshing
just
nothing
here
to
say
its
a
good
beer
light
bodied
meant
for
the
masses
of
the
population
in
mass
quantity
it
was
so
run
of
the
mill
i
should
have
done
a
sake
bomb
with
it
pours
a
clear
golden
color
the
nose
is
mostly
bitter
hops
the
head
rises
and
falls
quickly
the
taste
is
sweet
malt
and
bitters
hops
slightly
out
of
balance
pretty
decent
and
drinkable
i
dont
usually
just
drink
this
beer
by
itself
like
tonight
i
find
it
is
my
best
friend
at
the
sushi
bar
though
good
friends
sapporo
sushi
sashimi
and
hand
rolls
with
a
lot
of
wasabi
are
the
perfect
combination
very
drinkable
even
by
itself
good
clean
finish
typical
american
style
lager
basically
nothing
special
golden
in
color
with
thin
white
head
that
vanished
almost
immediately
almost
unnoticable
malt
nose
and
sweet
taste
slightly
floral
bitter
hop
bite
somewhat
dry
finish
but
it
left
my
palete
still
salivating
because
it
was
so
sweet
in
the
finish
light
in
body
drinkable
when
you
have
just
gone
beer
shopping
but
nothing
is
cold
and
your
roomate
left
on
in
the
fridge
the
beer
pours
the
prototypical
lager
golden
yellow
color
with
a
modest
bright
white
head
that
is
semicreamy
in
texture
and
the
leftover
lace
a
thin
but
concealing
sheet
upon
the
glass
nose
is
all
malt
crisp
and
clean
start
is
malt
with
the
top
skeletal
and
the
finish
pertinently
acidic
hops
adequate
and
the
aftertaste
dry
and
long
lasting
o
k
when
youre
into
something
light
but
not
anything
to
write
home
about
pours
a
pale
golden
straw
color
with
a
thin
white
head
nose
is
fresh
malts
and
grains
with
notes
of
wet
wood
a
bit
of
a
musky
quality
comes
through
in
the
taste
with
a
dry
finish
not
a
beer
id
recommend
lemoncolored
pour
with
active
carbonation
that
contributes
to
a
substantial
head
of
foam
smell
is
light
in
both
flavor
and
strength
with
some
floral
scents
and
a
hint
of
crispness
an
interesting
flavor
with
the
light
crisp
floral
scents
showing
up
at
the
front
of
the
drink
those
flavors
fade
gradually
in
favor
of
a
dryer
almost
yeasty
taste
mouthfeel
is
not
as
clean
as
expected
from
a
clear
crisp
beer
like
this
but
its
fine
as
is
the
drinkability
despite
an
interesting
flavor
profile
this
is
a
simple
beer
that
neither
amazes
nor
offends
result
its
akin
to
a
middleoftheroad
everyday
lager
ps
do
not
get
the
bottle
pours
a
bright
lightgolden
color
with
a
nice
white
head
and
some
lace
head
does
not
last
long
and
settles
into
a
thin
sheet
skunky
aroma
with
some
malt
and
floral
hop
light
body
and
slightly
watery
mouthfeel
very
weak
and
not
much
taste
some
malt
is
percieved
finishes
with
a
dryness
and
some
hop
bitterness
another
fizzy
yellow
lager
we
have
enough
of
these
so
there
is
no
need
to
import
more
i
enjoyed
this
japanese
offering
here
is
a
brew
that
is
appealing
to
the
eye
as
well
as
the
taste
buds
a
light
golden
honey
colour
with
a
2
finger
head
when
first
poured
that
disapates
to
a
gentle
lace
and
ring
a
slight
hoppy
taste
is
evident
but
pleasing
there
is
no
similarity
between
this
fluid
and
draught
beer
it
has
a
dark
gold
color
good
white
frothy
head
that
slowly
dissipates
a
flowery
pilsen
hops
nose
and
then
the
let
down
nice
grassy
start
then
a
heavy
breadlike
heavy
taste
and
a
sweet
finish
some
sort
of
lingering
after
taste
sorry
i
dont
have
my
beer
thesaurus
handy
but
the
finish
was
so
much
unfamiliar
from
the
draughts
i
am
used
to
i
have
to
assume
the
thing
is
a
marketing
scam
this
beer
can
only
appeal
to
mr
roboto
who
buys
on
image

not
beer
taste
certainly
not
draught
beer
not
bad
serve
cold
pours
a
pleasant
medium
gold
with
lots
of
carbonation
and
a
decent
snowwhite
head
good
lace
aroma
of
malt
and
some
mild
hops
taste
begins
with
sweet
malt
and
a
sting
of
carbonation
towards
the
end
of
the
taste
the
malt
fades
and
bitter
lemon
hops
come
into
play
finish
is
a
touch
dry
a
pleasant
drinkable
beer
the
original
draft
beer
that
sapporo
makes
is
much
better
try
that
one
instead
this
clear
light
golden
brew
is
topped
off
with
a
medium
sized
fizzy
white
head
carbonation
is
evident
smells
skunky
and
moldy
taste
is
not
much
better
although
i
do
detect
a
drying
effect
on
the
buds
that
isnt
bad
there
is
hardly
any
perceivable
malt
backbone
in
this
thing
very
light
body
a
little
too
carbonated
which
makes
it
less
drinkable
if
there
was
no
other
choice
on
a
100
degree
day
id
drink
this
otherwise
i
wouldnt
well
to
start
with
the
soapy
head
looked
like
the
foam
in
the
toilet
after
you
finish
going
it
was
the
most
unappetizing
thing
i
have
ever
seen
stinky
aroma
with
no
real
flavor
to
speak
of
kind
of
tastes
like
soapy
water
i
have
heard
this
is
better
in
the
can
but
i
am
now
reluctant
to
try
that
pours
a
very
clear
straw
color
with
a
small
head
that
fades
into
just
a
thin
layer
the
smell
is
faint
but
reveals
a
lemony
twang
and
not
much
else
very
watery
mouthfeel
and
bland
taste
i
would
say
this
must
be
japans
own
coors
light
it
is
crisp
but
its
nearly
like
drinking
carbonated
water
with
a
little
alcohol
i
can
usually
pick
out
flavors
but
im
struggling
with
this
one
there
is
absolutely
nothing
there
except
the
mouthfeel
and
a
little
carb
bite
sorry
i
couldnt
do
any
better
with
this
beer
definitely
nonoffensive
but
bland
as
hell
very
poor
in
my
book
kampai
i
couldnt
pick
this
out
in
a
blind
taste
test
with
kirin
ichiban
are
there
any
really
good
japanese
beers
out
there
this
is
like
the
geenric
lagers
from
every
other
country
yellow
fizzy
and
weak
medium
gold
in
color
with
thin
white
head
that
dissipates
rapidly
has
a
light
beer
aroma
of
a
not
really
discernable
malt
hop
combination
moderate
carbonation
level
coupled
with
a
light
body
gives
a
zesty
mouthfeel
some
hop
bitterness
in
the
flavor
backed
by
a
mellow
malt
character
brief
dry
slightly
hoptinged
finish
clean
and
interestingly
dry
but
rather
standard
sapporo
original
draft
pours
a
light
golden
with
a
fleeting
head
taste
of
hops
and
slight
malt
come
and
go
refreshing
but
somewhat
thin
for
a
pilsner
the
can
is
far
more
interesting
and
distinctive
all
in
all
not
terrible
this
is
a
good
beer
to
have
while
you
are
out
eating
sushi
or
other
japanese
food
as
it
really
cleanses
the
pallate
not
my
favorite
by
any
means
darker
straw
yellow
color
w
a
head
that
settles
quickly
the
unenticing
and
bland
aroma
is
comprised
of
light
dimethyl
sulfide
sweet
grainy
notes
and
a
hint
of
sulfur
in
the
finish
any
hop
nose
is
masked
by
the
grainy
malt
aroma
clean
dry
and
bland
all
around
in
flavor
as
expected
from
the
lack
of
residual
dextrins
and
protein
the
dearth
of
malt
complexity
and
hop
bitterness
and
flavor
renders
sapporo
a
beer
to
serve
a
purpose
wheres
my
sushi
and
wasabi
its
certainly
meant
to
accompany
flavorful
food
since
my
wife
barred
me
from
sake
after
an
unfortunate
meltdown
a
few
years
back
sapporo
has
to
do
when
were
out
for
sushi
its
got
to
the
typical
japanese
lager
appearance
and
smell
but
a
slightly
less
grainy
taste
than
the
canadianbrewed
kirin
slight
graininess
and
hops
very
clean
finish
very
light
in
color
basic
lager
however
i
have
to
confess
i
found
myself
liking
this
while
eating
spicy
foods
clean
crisp
rather
refreshing
i
think
its
a
lot
tastier
than
the
american
made
macros
nothing
id
go
out
of
my
way
for
but
seems
like
itd
be
refreshing
on
a
hot
summer
day
i
guess
i
wasnt
really
expecting
much
with
this
oneno
real
taste
to
speak
of
quite
watery
sure
was
a
nice
can
though
not
a
big
fan
a
beer
in
a
can
and
i
can
see
why
with
sapporo
the
beer
poured
well
and
had
a
nice
headbut
the
taste
was
average
and
really
no
aroma
budweiser
in
fancier
can
notes
japans
1
imported
beer
and
a
very
refreshing
lager
equal
to
if
not
better
than
many
us
equivalents
over
the
average
good
taste
and
feel
i
intended
to
review
this
beer
at
tsunami
sushi
asian
cuisine
but
since
they
gave
away
my
valentines
day
reservation
bastards
i
had
to
settle
for
a
can
from
publix
by
the
way
bonus
points
for
the
insanely
sturdy
can
if
i
ever
get
in
to
a
bar
fight
screw
the
bottles
give
me
a
sapporo
the
beer
doesnt
have
the
same
constitution
as
the
can
though
its
comparable
to
your
average
domestic
macro
lager
pours
with
a
transparent
fizzy
yellowwater
appearance
with
active
carbonation
and
several
inches
of
nice
frothy
snowwhite
foam
quality
lacing
remains
as
the
snow
cap
cover
gradually
melts
away
the
mild
unoffensive
aroma
whispers
of
soft
grain
not
much
going
on
in
the
nose
traces
of
hops
and
perhaps
a
touch
of
fruitiness
super
clean
the
first
sip
has
me
thinking
of
cork
a
husky
corklike
flavor
and
a
little
woody
accent
ride
over
mild
malt
sweetness
a
bit
dry
with
an
interesting
complimentary
bitterness
nicely
balanced
with
a
clean
finish
that
hints
at
white
rice
in
the
aftertaste
adequate
body
and
carbonation
produce
a
light
but
respectable
texture
this
would
have
been
the
perfect
palate
cleanser
to
the
shrimp
tempura
that
i
never
got
to
eat
its
just
a
standard
lager
not
overly
refreshing
not
overly
tasteful
wouldnt
turn
my
nose
to
it
but
wouldnt
look
for
it
average
beer
better
than
american
domestic
drafts
but
only
drink
when
it
is
the
only
option
lifeless
and
flat
taste
carbonation
okay
color
clear
okay
for
a
light
beer
but
if
you
getting
the
steak
its
not
a
great
pick
get
the
sushi
overall
a
good
beer
for
pairing
with
a
light
meal
sushi
perhaps
or
for
a
hot
summer
day
cmon
people
its
the
sushi
joint
beer
of
choice
kirin
ichiban
please
that
said
id
never
order
one
of
these
outside
of
a
sushi
restaurant
despite
that
oh
so
sexy
looking
can
you
should
always
drink
the
same
beer
as
the
cuisine
youre
eating
imo
the
body
is
light
and
goes
semidry
only
toward
the
finish
its
quite
crisp
all
the
way
and
more
than
moderately
clean
its
got
a

go

bomb
beer
for
what
its

i
drink
this
when
we
go
out
to
asian
places
for

its
ok
i
like
it
nothing
special
similar
to
a
coors
lite

with
more

in
the
flavor

very
easy

price
for
what
you
get
is

if
you
find
it
at
a
good
price
by
all
means
try
it
but
as
an
import
its
going
to
be

expensive
when
you
can
usually
find
a

hour
coors
like
for
more
then
half
the
cost
of
this
over
all
not
a
bad
brew
given
the
proper
setting
went
very
well
with
stir
fry
veg
and
sea
scallops
there
is
a
good
maltiness
and
lacks
hoppiness
however
the
drinkability
makes
it
a
go
to
for
me
as
an
adjunct
lager
decent
enough
japanese
brew
goes
good
with
some
stir
fry
get
more
as
long
as
its
free
grins
overall
this
beers
ok
not
too
memorable
but
good
enough
poured
from
a
can
into
a
pilsner
the
beer
is
an
extremely
light
pale
clear
yellow
coloring
with
a
tall
foamy
light
white
head
roasty
and
grainy
aromas
but
light
overall
flavors
are
light
with
a
grainy
profile
and
a
slight
lemon
highlight
the
aftertaste
is
toasty
and
slightly
cereal
with
a
crisp
clean
finish
about
what
is
expected
from
a
rice
brew
blue
sushi
in
omaha
had
these
on
special
for
1
so
i
figured
i
couldnt
go
wrong
i
guess
you
get
what
you
pay
for
though
i
have
never
really
looked
into
japanese
beer
before
so
i
was
excited
to
give
this
one
a
try
turns
out
it
is
pretty
much
the
japanese
equivalent
to
an
american
macro
brew
this
beer
had
no
smell
to
it
whatsoever
and
tasted
pretty
much
the
same
i
cant
complain
to
much
for
a
buck
but
i
wont
ever
be
drinking
this
one
again
had
this
one
while
enjoying
some
thai
food
good
thing
the
food
was
good
served
from
tap
into
a
shaker
poured
a
golden
yellow
with
a
minimal
white
head
maintained
excellent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
wheat
grain
and
subtle
fruit
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
wheat
grain
subtle
banana
and
very
subtle
fruit
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
high
carbonation
overall
this
brew
was
not
really
anything
to
get
excited
about
this
is
basically
the
bmc
of
japan
im
guessing
and
it
lets
you
know
this
with
similar
flavors
however
the
fruit
hints
i
got
were
a
nice
touch
but
did
not
do
anything
well
enough
for
the
beer
to
save
it
will
not
be
having
again
o
predominant
rice
additions
dont
hinder
this
defectfree
beer
for
me
for
the
style
its
delicious
and
damn
if
it
isnt
refreshing
after
a
long
day
at
work
thank
you
sir
may
i
have
another
o
interesting
japanese
rice
lager
one
of
the
few
that
ive
had
it
was
a
nice
beer
on
a
hot
summer
day
but
nothing
i
would
grab
again
beer
is
medium
to
light
in
body
and
sweet
throughout
the
finish
is
mildly
dry
and
not
too
bad
all
of
these
sapporo
beers
are
identical
imo
just
different
cans
pours
a
fizzy
yellow
hue
typical
adjunct
lager
look
mild
carbonation
and
a
one
finger
head
smeels
of
corn
syrup
and
rice
taste
is
similir
cornsryup
with
just
a
touch
of
rice
at
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
overall
a
decent
beer
for
a
party
t
its
actually
not
that
bad
there
isnt
a
lot
of
flavor
here
but
its
crisp
and
clean
and
doesnt
get
incredibly
undrinkable
as
it
warms
one
of
the
better
lagers
in
mass
production
light
citrus
and
pale
malts
along
with
the
slightest
bit
of
grassy
hops
pours
a
nice
one
finger
head
its
really
frothy
and
it
looks
like
its
giving
me
good
lacing
its
diminished
substantially
since
i
poured
it
but
its
still
leaving
a
good
layer
on
the
top
of
the
body
the
body
is
piss
yellow
and
completely
see
through
it
looks
like
a
standard
macro
lager
accept
for
the
decent
lacing
overall
not
a
very
good
look
but
the
lacing
is
nice
there
is
some
crisp
hop
on
the
nose
along
with
a
sweet
and
sour
malty
smell
smells
like
a
lager
but
one
tiny
step
above
the
rest
because
i
can
get
some
hops
on
the
nose
overall
the
smell
is
very
faint
but
it
smells
decent
when
i
can
smell
it
yeah
there
is
for
sure
a
nice
hop
character
in
this
beer
when
you
compare
it
to
a
budwieser
or
some
macro
beer
like
that
its
a
pretty
small
hop
flavor
but
thats
really
ok
because
its
a
lager
overall
the
flavor
is
pretty
simple
there
is
for
sure
a
malt
flavor
and
on
some
sips
you
pick
up
significant
alcohol
considering
its
only
5
you
can
tell
the
beer
is
made
with
rice
but
really
it
doesnt
bother
me
because
its
not
like
they
are
trying
to
cut
cost
thats
just
the
style
where
as
when
its
used
in
an
american
macro
they
are
trying
to
cut
cost
and
it
doesnt
work
with
the
beer
mouthfeel
is
decent
pretty
thin
and
a
little
watery
but
the
carbonation
is
just
perfect
the
drinkability
is
pretty
damn
nice
too
there
really
isnt
anything
wrong
with
this
beer
so
its
not
hard
to
drink
and
its
pretty
light
overall
i
good
lager
and
since
its
mass
produced
a
very
good
macro
lager
not
an
amazing
beer
but
one
i
wouldnt
mind
having
especially
over
a
normal
macro
lager
d
it
fits
its
style
easy
enough
but
not
much
really
going
on
with
this
at
all
mouthfeeldrinkability
a
bit
more
substance
than
one
would
expect
for
such
a
light
colored
beer
almost
creamy
but
some
fizzy
qualities
thin
it
out
a
bit
quite
crisp
and
refreshing
really
not
that
good
in
my
opinion
but
not
bad
either
i
would
definitely
buy
again
if
i
was
having
some
sushi
would
make
a
nice
pairing
easy
drinking
beer
makes
this
good
for
summer
of
course
its
a
staple
at
many
sushi
restaurants
as
well
the
brew
is
really
light
and
easy
drinking
not
something
i
would
seek
out
this
style
brew
to
me
is
boring
but
honestly
i
would
rather
have
this
then
an
american
macro
brew
d
i
tried
it
and
now
know
i
dont
like
it
for
a
sushi
pairing
this
beer
is
fine
by
itself
i
wouldnt
buy
it
but
ill
give
it
an
average
rating
i
would
call
this
a
very
good
candidate
for
the
beer
geeks
lawn
mower
beer
deserves
to
be
quaffed
at
a
very
cold
temperature
by
itself
i
would
not
enjoy
this
beer
however
i
had
it
with
a
big
plate
of
sushi
and
it
was
a
perfect
match
d
a
fair
lighter
lager
lighter
than
regular
sapporo
or
reserve
basically
budweiser
with
a
japanese
label
d
not
bad
definitely
a
decent
session
beer
but
i
would
not
drink
it
again
this
beer
is
a
mystery
but
finally
i
got
the
urge
to
get
this
at
my
job
and
take
it
home
awesome
beer
nice
gold
color
sweet
malt
foamy
white
head
decent
lacing
floral
or
buttery
taste
that
lingers
kind
of
waxy
after

this
beer
is
one
of
the
few
that
i
have
encountered
better
out
of
a
can
drinkablity
tasty
sapporo
brew
slightly
crisper

rr
comment
this
beer
is
refreshing
and
light
with
a
good
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
a
good
beer
plus
the
can
is
pretty
unique
a
pretty
good
beer
for
the
style
anyway
easy
to
throw
back
a
couple
with
some
sushi
or
tenpura
not
going
to
blow
anyone
away
though
d
overall
i
wasnt
impressed
it
tasted
like
a
ricey
version
of
the
american
macro
light
beers
the
can
that
it
comes
in
is
its
best
attribute
imo
really
cool
looking
can
the
color
was
pale
as
expected
i
didnt
note
a
real
distinct
flavor
that
would
make
it
enjoyable
to
me
mouth
feel
was
pleasant
and
finished
dry
for
its
style
it
certainly
is
right
on
and
in
the
right
circumstance
such
as
a
sushi
restraunt
it
has
its
place
just
not
a
favorite
style
for
me
if
there
was
a
score
for
making
the
beer
bland
and
taste
like
nothing
55
a
little
different
but
i
could
drink
a
couple
of
these
in
a
sitting
d
if
paired
with
food
or
a
hot
day
it
would
be
pretty
sessionable
but
this
is
must
a
touch
to
thin
cheers
smell
and
taste
are
both
grainy
the
whole
way
through
lots
of
dry
rice
flavors
in
there
with
a
solid
crispness
bringing
it
all
together
theres
really
no
complexities
to
this
beer
and
its
kind
of
nice
its
very
humble
could
drink
more
than
one
of
these
if
desired
i
buy
this
beer
todaydoes
not
have
any
date
on
the
bottle
and
other
thing
that
i
found
interesting
is
that
the
bottle
says
japans
oldest
brand
but
the
one
that
i
have
was
brew
in
canada
i
put
the
beer
on
a
mug
it
have
a
gold
color
with
a
white
head
that
leaves
inmediatlythe
smell
is
nothing
to
be
impress
about
good
taste
i
taste
like
honey
just
i
little
bit
but
is
there
this
beer
would
be
good
will
fish
i
would
drink
this
beer
again
this
is
maybe
one
step
above
the
american
macros
which
isnt
saying
much
if
it
wasnt
for
the
sushi
i
probably
wouldnt
drink
it
this
is
my
choice
whenever
i
have
japanese
food
or
even
just
some
sushi
this
rice
lager
pours
and
light
pale
yellow
with
a
quick
head
and
plenty
of
carbonation
its
good
with
a
lot
of
rice
and
a
clean
scent
the
taste
is
clean
and
a
bit
sweet
a
fantastic
compliment
to
sushi
tempura
or
teriyaki
very
refreshing
and
it
balance
out
wasabi
perfectly
quite
drinkable
and
ill
usually
put
away
a
couple
of
these
with
some
good
toro
uni
and
ikura
pours
a
light
straw
color
with
little
head
slightly
sweet
reminded
me
mostly
of
an
american
macro
lager
except
with
more
carbonation
which
created
an
interesting
crisp
mouthfeel
malts
are
evident
in
the
smell
and
taste
good
when
very
cold
props
to
sapporo
on
the
bullet
can
and
making
a
decent
rice
lager
taste
was
grainy
like
corn
or
rice
i
would
call
this
a
green
taste
very
little
bitter
and
aftertaste
is
dry
every
sip
this
beer
is
starting
to
bore
me
more
and
i
cant
imagine
drinking
this
all
night
d
if
i
wasnt
eating
hibachi
i
wouldnt
normally
drink
japanese
lagers
this
is
fine
for
mass
consumption
but
i
will
stick
with
domestics
for
that
since
these
can
be
spendy
asahi
is
better
for
food
imho
but
try
both
or
kirin
to
find
what
you
like
most
very
drinkable
i
could
have
had
several
but
since
we
were
just
out
for
dinner
i
had
to
settle
for
two
best
japanese
beer
i
ever
had
lowlights
it
was
yellow
fizzy
and
devoid
of
any
real
smelling
or
tasting
notes
unimpressed
pours
pale
straw
with
an
slightly
imperfect
clarity
soapy
two
and
a
halffinger
head
fades
quickly
to
dismal
lacing
clean
nose
some
rice
adjunct
possible
pale
malt
taste
with
plenty
of
rice
adjunct
flavor
aftertaste
is
dry
with
a
husky
astringency
that
has
a
bite
to
it
yet
not
quite
harsh
both
tiny
flowing
and
rapid
and
large
chunky
bubbles
make
a
high
carbonation
in
a
thinnish
body
mouthfeel
is
somewhere
between
crisp
and
rough
finishes
clean
with
a
touch
of
rice
adjunct
but
fairly
drinkable
for
a
rice
lager
hops
are
not
found
body
is
light
and
is
drinkable
rather
clean
tasting
sort
of
light
vinegary
twang
acetic
acid
in
the
finish
some
fruit
characteristic
again
too
not
terribly
enjoyable
i
struggled
to
down
the
last
half
of
this
beer
is
this
the
worst
beer
ive
ever
had
im
not
sure
but
its
definitely
a
top
contender
i
have
held
out
on
reviewing
all
the
other
beers
i
have
endured
which
is
to
say
that
all
of
the
macro
beers
on
the
north
american
continent
that
i
can
think
of
canadian
american
and
mexican
i
think
this
should
become
the
watermark
for
american
mainly
u
s
macro
especially
since
if
you
have
enough
to
afford
them
you
can
afford
this
there
isnt
nearly
as
much
corn
and
rice
flavor
as
in
the
macros
you
can
let
this
warm
up
and
sit
for
a
while
and
its
still
is
palletable
as
opposed
to
the
u
s
macros
that
become
undrinkable
actually
there
are
some
that
cant
be
drank
unless
they
are
ice
cold
definantly
worth
being
stocked
i
keep
trying
this
in
the
hopes
that
all
the
friendly
suggestions
i
got
for
it
werent
wrong
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
its
really
inconsistent
and
doesnt
stand
out
in
any
setting
ive
had
overly
carbonated
yellowgolder
color
with
a
fluffy
white
head
that
faded
quickly
nothing
but
a
bit
of
grass
on
the
nose
really
really
slight
and
almost
nonexistent
mostly
you
smelled
acidic
bubbles
bursting
ok
malting
and
hops
but
nothing
special
and
each
time
ive
had
it
it
has
varied
quite
a
bit
a
bit
thin
and
the
carbonation
was
too
much
its
a
pretty
good
beer
considering
the
style
ingredients
and
origins
its
tough
to
get
this
one
right
its
light
and
refreshing
pours
a
thin
straw
color
with
descent
carbonation
that
fades
quickly
a
little
lacing
but
nothing
to
get
excited
about
faint
aromas
of
light
vegetables
grain
sweetness
and
hops
flavors
are
lightly
citrusy
grainy
and
sweet
body
is
fair
for
style
light
by
ba
standards
but
medium
for
a
lager
in
firmness
texture
and
creamyness
finishes
very
crisp
yet
not
overly
dry
mildly
alcoholic
and
hop
flavored
its
not
that
this
is
a
great
beer
but
there
are
no
obvious
flaws
poured
light
golden
yellow
in
colour
weak
white
head
not
much
to
the
aroma
and
it
didnt
excite
the
palate
it
wasnt
bad
however
cold
it
is
quite
satisfying
it
comes
in
a
neat
looking
silver
can
shaped
somewhat
like
an
hour
glass
my
first
adventure
with
japanese
beer
not
great
but
in
a
pinch
if
i
was
thirsty
i
could
drink
one
of
these
colder
the
better
for
this
brew
as
far
as
a
dinner
beer
goes
this
one
could
be
versatile
as
it
finishes
clean
the
smell
is
the
only
downside
of
this
brew
though
not
as
nasty
as
some
of
the
beer
from
asia
this
one
is
not
a
favorite
it
also
isnt
useful
by
itself
it
is
however
okay
for
washing
down
sushi
and
for
the
coolness
of
the
oilcan
smooth
moderately
carbonated
and
light
bodied
easy
to
drink
and
great
with
grilled
dishes
and
raw
fish
if
you
do
go
out
for
japanese
you
might
as
well
go
the
whole
9
yards
but
i
wouldnt
try
this
stand
alone
again
pale
yellow
color
with
a
decend
foamy
white
head
smells
clean
with
some
grains
faint
malts
and
hops
light
carbonated
body
no
soda
like
mouthfeel
like
most
american
mainstrem
lagers
taste
crisp
with
some
hop
bitterness
light
malts
and
cooked
grains
not
bad
not
bad
at
all
goes
great
with
any
asian
cuisine
a
higher
quality
than
american
premium
lagers
22
oz
can
that
can
presumably
be
called
a
metal

clear
light
gold
color
lots
of
visible
carbonation
small
white
bubbly
head
just
a
layer
on
top
of
the
beer
smell
is
metallic
and
slightly
malty
taste
is
thin
and
grainy
no
hops
anywhere
with
a
metallic
funk
that
makes
this
rather
unenjoyable
just
an
average
at
best
lager
get
it
above
bmc
but
i
tend
to
stay
away
from
japanese
beer
brewed
in
guelph
ontario
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
thin
drinkability
was
average
nothing
stood
out
really
this
beer
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
small
head
that
dissipates
quickly
on
the
nose
i
get
some
maltiness
the
taste
is
thrist
quenching
with
malty
characteristics
the
mouthfeel
is
bubbly
effervescent
this
would
be
a
good
beer
to
pair
with
a
spicy
dish
that
is
probably
why
it
is
notorious
for
the
sushi
beer
to
quench
the
wasbi
flame
drinkability
i
could
drink
these
things
all
day
while
working
in
the
yard
etc
its
a
beer
you
have
to
drink
cold
though
i
dont
know
what
it
would
taste
like
warmed
up
and
i
dont
want
to
find
out
light
bodied
pretty
generic
middle
of
the
road
lager
smells
crisp
slightly
fruity
very
crisp
light
taste
with
hints
of
grain
and
fruit
kind
of
a
creamy
aftertaste
not
all
that
much
in
the
way
of
taste
though
high
carbonation
makes
for
a
nice
mouthfeel
and
it
goes
down
smooth
i
did
not
like
this
one
it
has
more
flavor
than
the
big
american
macros
but
the
flavor
is
a
bit
of
a
putrid
flavor
it
is
not
overly
bitter
for
i
cannot
detect
any
real
hops
i
struggle
to
pinpoint
the
taste
it
basically
tastes
like
spoiled
corn
i
would
say
overall
it
does
not
go
down
very
well
it
is
no
better
than
bud
or
coors
or
mgd
like
i
said
i
can
only
hope
that
i
got
a
bad
can
if
i
can
bring
myself
to
buy
another
and
it
tastes
better
i
will
update
this
review
the
beer
pours
a
pale
gold
color
with
a
spotty
white
lace
head
the
aroma
is
sweet
almost
like
a
weak
hefe
i
guess
its
from
the
yeast
because
it
looks
like
nothing
but
pale
malts
the
taste
is
not
that
good
it
is
extremely
watery
with
little
malt
flavor
it
has
a
refreshing
finish
but
it
lacks
any
real
character
the
mouthfeel
is
average
it
is
a
low
bodied
beer
with
low
carbonation
it
drinks
not
too
well
it
is
a
lousy
lager
this
is
one
of
my
favourite
asian
beers
though
at
this
time
im
consuming
it
from
a
can
i
have
poured
it
before
and
it
is
a
golden
straw
colour
it
has
a
very
light
weight
smell
to
it
and
lightweight
taste
as
well
a
tiny
bit
of
biscuit
i
think
personally
an
a
light
carbonation
which
accounts
for
its
drinkability
this
stuff
is
almost
thirst
quenching
i
can
chug
this
stuff
with
no
problem
if
youre
wanting
a
deep
flavourful
beer
you
can
drink
and
pick
apart
get
something
from
bavaria
if
you
want
a
cold
beer
you
guzzle
but
dont
want
some
mainstream
foolishness
like
bud
or
coors
grab
a
sapporo
22
oz
artsy
can
um
so
this
is
dry
really
theres
a
nice
smell
when
you
first
flip
the
can
tab
but
it
doesnt
carry
over
into
the
taste
less
malt
taste
to
come
through
which
makes
me
think
of
adjuncts
sure
enough
the
taste
is
gone
as
soon
as
i
swallow
i
suppose
it
would
go
good
with
food
but
so
would
an
instant
iced
tea
draft
should
imply
that
its
filtered
instead
of
pasteurized
but
i
get
none
of
that
here
just
barley
water
god
i
hate
cans
of
course
i
dont
think
this
brew
would
have
been
that
much
better
from
a
bottle
or
an
draft
overall
another
subpar
japanese
beer
i
found
this
difficult
to
drink
liquid
metal
has
never
been
one
of
my
favorite
beverages
what
little
flavor
is
present
in
this
beer
just
isnt
very
good
appearance
is
a
bit
cloudier
than
many
beers
head
vanishes
without
a
trace
in
almost
no
time
at
all
smell
is
faint
tastes
like
it
smells
not
really
bad
in
any
way
but
its
a
bit
bland
more
than
drinkable
but
not
really
impressive
in
any
way
not
really
worth
the
inflated
pricetag
that
seems
to
come
with
it
pours
a
light
golden
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
the
tall
silver
22
oz
can
the
beer
came
in
was
much
more
impressive
in
appearance
with
its
narrower
base
and
textured
sides
both
the
aroma
and
taste
are
very
mild
a
hint
of
freshly
cut
grass
and
perhaps
a
hint
of
hops
fairly
smooth
with
a
light
to
medium
body
a
fairly
drinkable
beer
while
i
didnt
dislike
this
beer
and
would
drink
it
again
if
someone
handed
me
one
it
is
not
something
i
would
seek
out
this
beer
pours
a
pale
yellow
with
very
foamy
white
head
that
reduces
quickly
a
few
carbonation
bubbles
can
be
seen
floating
to
the
top
after
being
poured
the
head
reduces
to
a
very
thin
film
lace
is
very
nice
near
the
top
of
the
glass
grains
are
the
dominate
aroma
the
taste
is
quite
bland
and
finishes
weak
this
is
a
light
bodied
beer
and
at
the
price
that
i
payed
for
it
i
will
not
be
drinking
it
again
everything
we
know
i
could
not
even
finish
the
can
i
poured
a
full
half
of
this
beer
down
the
sink
forgive
me
beer
gods
bleeech
this
is
a
good
brew
here
its
like
a
regular
american
beer
but
it
tastes
way
better
its
rich
in
malt
and
hops
plus
it
even
has
a
nice
little
head
to
it
ofcourse
it
doesnt
last
long
but
its
still
there
its
a
pale
yellow
color
its
got
a
dry
finish
but
its
not
that
dry
the
can
is
friggin

it
had
a
slightly
and
not

it
still
had
the
eurolager
taste

what
i
thought
was
more
than
its

fair
share
of

the

hand
it

sour
and
grainy
smells
but
somewhat
pleasant
and
appealing
carbonation
was
a
bit
highly
charged
but
did
not
overwhelm
the
very
adequate
sweet
malty
taste
super
clean
and
crisp
taste
paired
great
with
spicy
chinese
food
decent
shot
of
bitterness
in
mid
taste
then
a
sweet
balanced
finish
nothing
lingers
very
refreshing
and
a
great
choice
with
japanese
or
spicy
chines
food
easy
going
well
balanced
and
compliments
food
nicely
to
the
best
of
my
ability
ive
only
ever
been
able
to
find
the
original
draft
beer
in
a
22
oz
can
ive
often
wondered
if
its
the
same
beer
that
comes
in
the
sharp
looking
embossed
bottle
with
the
shiny
black
twocolor
gold
label
the
can
advertises
ceramic
filtration
but
the
bottles
only
say
cold
filtered
all
beer
is
filtered
cold
so
i
did
a
side
by
side
tasting
the
color
and
head
retention
appear
to
be
the
same
although
the
beer
from
the
can
is
slightly
hazy
and
may
have
to
do
with
the
age
of
the
sample
the
light
beer
aroma
appears
to
be
the
same
with
the
exception
that
there
may
be
a
little
skunkiness
in
the
bottled
sample
the
flavor
also
appears
to
be
the
same
although
the
mouthfeel
of
the
canned
beer
is
a
little
smoother
so
in
conclusion
its
my
belief
that
if
there
is
any
difference
between
the
two
beers
its
simply
in
filtration
and
packaging
a
decent
beer
but
nothing
special
pours
a
clear
gold
color
modest
white
head
and
fair
lace
that
dissipates
quickly
malt
nose
thin
middle
finish
is
crisp
and
potently
acidic
adequate
for
those
times
your
into
something
light
been
a
long
time
since
i
sampled
still
the
same
drinkable
but
not
something
that
appeals
to
me
not
terrible
but
this
is
like
the
heine
of
japanese
beers
it
is
just
better
out
of
the
can
the
bottle
was
much
more
bitter
and
had
more
carbonation
it
was
not
the
same
crisp
brew
that
comes
out
of
the
silver
bullet
cans
oh
well
behold
this
beer
has
a
nice
sized
head
and
a
malty
nose
with
a
hint
of
lemon
it
is
light
yellow
in
appearance
and
perfectly
carbonated
this
beer
is
one
with
a
body
that
isnt
too
big
and
is
very
smooth
this
is
a
very
well
balanced
beer
and
nothing
really
seems
out
of
place
when
sipped
it
starts
out
with
the
fizz
alcohol
and
a
little
citrus
followed
by
a
tiny
bit
of
grains
and
malt
a
very
good
beer
all
around
also
the
can
rocks
poured
a
nice
golden
straw
color
with
a
creamy
white
head
that
slowly
sank
the
smell
was
mostly
skunk
with
some
mild
sweetness
the
skunkyness
wasnt
too
bad
in
the
flavor
but
the
only
other
flavor
i
got
was
adjunct
sweetness
the
mouthfeel
was
somewhat
crisp
and
refreshing
although
i
didnt
find
the
beer
to
be
very
drinkable
i
really
didnt
like
this
beer
but
after
reading
the
other
reveiws
i
think
that
maybe
it
was
a
bad
can
of
it
the
flavor
was
not
very
good
and
it
certainly
wasnt
dry
i
couldnt
even
bring
myself
to
finish
the
can
i
have
to
say
that
i
was
drinking
this
while
eating
chinese
food
that
was
not
good
and
it
may
have
effected
my
opinion
of
the
beer
as
well
as
it
kind
of
made
the
whole
ordeal
unappetizing
sp
i
will
give
it
another
try
next
time
i
get
japanese
quite
hazy
golden
color
a
decent
head
forms
and
sticks
around
and
a
fair
amount
of
carbonation
a
sort
of
citrusy
zest
in
the
nose
not
much
malt
character
and
thin
in
the
mouth
a
crisp
sort
of
lemonlime
flavor
imparts
itself
on
the
tongue
pretty
quenching
and
refreshing
i
know
this
a
japanese
beer
but
i
think
it
would
be
killer
with
some
hot
mexican
food
or
as
a
chaser
for
a
shot
of
tequila
crisp
and
refreshing
made
to
eat
with
spicey
beef
not
much
to
it
and
thats
a
good
thing
you
dont
want
this
beer
to
dominate
just
to
fulfill
your
thirst
and
allow
you
to
drink
and
eat
more
worth
ordering
at
a
sushi
bar
just
for
the
cool
can
reasonably
crisp
and
clean
and
a
good
choice
with
a
meal
but
not
enough
character
to
merit
having
a
couple
without
food
notes
this
is
the
same
beer
that
is
sold
in
12
and
16oz
sizes
however
we
have
to
give
the
can
its
due
respect
hands
down
this
brew
is
at
the
top
of
the
list
for
some
of
the
better
mainstream
lagers
imported
into
the
us
goes
extremely
well

it

around

more
than
a

d
i
was
pleasant
surprised
by
this
in
its

i
dont

i
will
be
hitting
again
but
i
definately
enjoyed
this
above
average
beer

an
20

the

various

rising
to
the

abundant
frothy

the
smell
was
metalic
and
sour
there
was
almost
no
taste
at
all
very
watered
down
i
couldnt
even
detect
any
flavors
at
all
the

somewhat
crisp

made
me
burp
a

i
like
kirin
ichiban
but
not
this
bar
beer
may
be
a
good
beer
for
drinking
games
this
beer
was
definetly
below
the
bar
pun
intended
this
is
a
good
beer
for
what
it
is
aiming
for
refreshing
goes
well
with
spicy
food
i
get
this
beer
in
the
states
and
find
it
to
be
always
skunky
and
horrible
but
here
in
japan
its
fresh
and
wonderful
sad
to
say
that
i
am
leaving
in
a
week
and
this
is
the
first
time
that
i
had
this
beer
because
i
thought
how
it
was
in
the
states
was
how
it
would
be
here
in
japan
dead
wrong
drinkablity
this
would
have
been
better
with
more
hop
flavor
if
the
can
is
covered
in
pictures
of
hops
i
would
like
to
taste
a
few
more
in
the
product
very

better
perhaps
than
the
normal
kirin
ichiban
exp
july
2003
sapporo
is
better
if
your
sushi
joint
has
a
choice
but
not
if
its
priced
much
higher
the
feel
isnt
as
bad
as
the
flavor
would
portend
it
actually
feels
less
harsh
and
grainy
than
it
tastes
which
is
unusual
it
dries
out
much
too
hard
for
a
lightbodied
beer
though
and
despite
a
thin
texture
its
fairly
bright
it
certainly
is
crisp
at
least
goodbye
hong
kong
hello
tokyo
time
to
try
a
few
japanese
beers
on
my
travels
poured
from
an
11
2
oz
can
has
a
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
very
mild
a
touch
of
malts
taste
is
light
some
malts
rather
bland
and
boring
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
overall
while
nothing
offensive
just
left
me
wanting
more
overall
not
a
bad
beer
goes
well
with
hibachi
and
sake
o
this
is
a
below
average
lager
by
any
definition
really
has
no
character
and
its
awfully
boring
i
wouldnt
recomend
there
are
no
off
nodes
absolutely
nothing
unpleasant
but
its
basically
yellow
water
taste
is
ok
i
suppose
if
you
want
something
cold
fizzy
and
beery
to
go
with
food
or
pub
snacks
the
rice
and
starch
have
really
cut
the
taste
of
the
malt
and
there
isnt
much
of
a
hop
presence
theres
nothing
really
wrong
with
this
other
than
its
boring
pours
a
pale
yellow
color
some
carbonation
little
fizzy
white
head
with
not
much
sticky
lacing
left
behind
the
nose
is
grainy
ricy
skunky
the
taste
follows
the
nose
not
much
going
on
at
all
light
body
mostly
water
a
big
dissapointment
would
not
recommend
when
the
choice
at
the
sushi
place
is
kirin
or
sapporo
im
choosing
sapporo
or
actually
i
think
im
choosing
the
iced
tea
iced
tea
and
sushi
really
go
great
together
and
it
tastes
so
much
better
than
this
overall
just
not
even
a
beer
to
me
i
not
compliment
dinner
and
was
more
just
a
waste
of
3
bucks
d
a
non
offensive
beer
best
when
served
with
asian
food
maybe
a
little
the
average
ab
product
more
or
less
the
same
smells
like
nothing
at
all
maybe
slight
wheatiness
tastes
of
rice
adjuinct
no
esters
or
bitterness
light
sugar
and
barely
perceptible
malt
role
refreshing
like
water
or
instant
lemonade
easy
to
drink
reminds
me
of
mexican
beer
particularly
tecate
i
could
be
wrong
but
im
betting
they
both
use
rice
taste
more
metal
and
thats
about
it
metal
water
no
hops
lots
of
carbonation
this
stuff
is
7
a
6
pack
are
you
kidding
me
they
charge
less
for
water
at
concerts
or
sporting
events
a
decent
beer
with
food
i
guess
if
you
dont
want
to
have
anything
competing
flavor
wise
with
the
food
not
much
really
to
say
other
than
its
very
easy
to
drink
aroma
and
taste
is
nonexistant
very
simple
rice
lager
washed
down
a
meal
i
guess
but
really
for
7
a
bottle
you
need
to
offer
a
bit
more
than
that
the
best
thing
about
drinking
this
beer
would
be
some
spicy
food
or
a
sweltering
hot
day
drinkability
all
around
boring
beer
that
can
be
consumed
with
some
hot
and
spicy
food
but
not
as
a
stand
alone
session
beer
drinkablity
easily
consumable
cheap
and
readily
available
but
has
limited
character
drinkability
a
not
impressed
beer
in
the
style
japanese
rice
lager
drinkability
not
a
fan
a
blank
beer
with
zero
taste
id
rather
have
bud
light
and
thats
bad
appearance
is
decent
yellow
body
with
a
fluffy
white
head
and
some
lacing
sweet
slightly
leafy
aroma
body
has
a
very
mild
bitterness
a
good
dose
of
sweet
malts
and
little
else
fairly
bland
and
inoffensive
but
not
particularly
pleasurable
like
water
really
but
more
expensive
carbonation
is
high
and
body
is
light
overall
not
too
bad
but
then
again
not
too
good
either
average
on
all
accounts
there
is
no
need
for
anyone
to
ever
sample
this
beer
water
is
a
better
choice
every
time
taste
was
bland
some
maltiness
and
very
little
bitterness
for
the
rest
not
much
taste
not
even
when
the
beer
warms
tastes
like
you
would
expect
poor
kirin
is
trying
hard
to
be
the
producer
of
the
most
different
kinds
of
bad
beer
they
have
many
yuck
aftertaste
is
bile
beer
make
of
rice
also
like
sapporo
nice
flavor
hops
and
rich
in
adjoincts
special
for
the
seafood
and
fish
try
with
cheese
full
bodied
flavor
its
bottle
label
design
is
one
of
the
most
beatiful
in
the
beer
world
78
recommended
not
good
for
mexican
food
poured
a
pale
yellow
color
with
a
nice
puffy
white
head
smell
is
virtually
nonexistent
with
only
a
bit
of
metallic
noted
taste
is
very
light
with
nothing
offensive
or
overly
enjoyable
finishes
as
a
refreshing
beer
but
no
better
or
worse
than
any
other
lager
drinkable
but
nothing
to
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
a
try
for
sure
not
sure
id
buy
by
the
pack
medium
gold
in
color
with
a
medium
bright
white
head
that
fades
quickly
cratering
itself
smell
is
of
light
grassy
malt
and
a
bug
spray
like
alcohol
quality
taste
is
very
light
and
watery
with
most
of
the
flavor
coming
in
the
form
of
light
maltiness
no
hops
present
mouthfeel
is
watery
thin
making
this
beer
represent
itself
as
a
watered
down
vrsion
of
a
standard
euro
lager
which
is
probably
the
result
of
rice
in
the
brewing
process
thin
and
boring
and
not
for
me
355
ml
brown
bottle
with
the
production
date
clearly
stamped
on
the
rear
label
another
world
classic
line
up
for
this
one
a
heavy
pour
and
got
a
threefingered
head
that
faded
quickly
to
a
ring
leaving
some
lace
clear
golden
color
light
carbonation
and
light
bodied

with
hints
of
hops

acton
ma
no
more
for
me
please
oelergud
drinkability
easier
to
drink
than
kirin
ichiban
like
any
number
of
liight
beers
this
goes
down
like

appearance
light
straw
yellow

lacing
sorry
looking
lager
aroma
grainy
corn
and
rice
combo
with
some
husky
offness
with
a
touch
of
hops
should
be
clean
and
fresh
smelling
like
a
nice
crisp
lager
should
be
taste
grainy
huskiness
along
with
the
corn
and
rice
adjuncts
not
what
i
was
looking
for
when
dining
japanese
is
drinkable
but
the
flavors
didnt
work
for
me
mouthfeel
thin
bodied
fizzy
carbonation
doesnt
satisfy
me
drinkability
well
yeah
i
will
probably
never
give
this
one
another
shot
much
rather
settle
for
a
sapporo
before
this
one
pours
light
straw
with
a
white
head
bit
of
hops
in
nose
not
much
else
very
light
bodied
lager
high
carbonation
not
much
malt
hops
or
flavor
some
nasty
off
flavors
applecotton
candy
tried
this
one
at
my
local
sushi
place
id
have
a
bud
or
miller
next
time
this
stuff
is
nasty
great
drinkability
my
wife
recommended
this
after
her
trip
to
japan
which
included
a
trip
to
a
saki
brewery
where
they
were
serving
kirin
alongside
the
saki
shots
ill
take
her
word
about
the
saki
but
the
kl
i
can
verify
as
tasty
dry
light
and
crisp
feel
too
bad
the
rest
of
the
beer
couldnt
back
up
the
refreshing
mouthfeel
i
dont
think
id
even
drink
this
in
a
japanese
restaurant
the
beer
pours
a
very
pale
gold
color
with
a
frothy
white
head
that
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
weak
but
clean
and
dry
it
has
the
scent
of
pale
malts
and
lager
yeast
the
taste
is
decent
it
has
a
dry
finish
the
beer
is
pretty
simplistic
in
flavor
there
is
the
presence
of
pale
lager
malts
and
not
much
else
it
tastes
refreshing
and
clean
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
low
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
it
drinks
well
a
fine
lager
in
the
mouth
theres
low
carbonation
just
enough
to
feel
at
the
end
of
a
gulp
if
not
taken
too
quickly
a
very
much
drinkable
beer
the
carbonation
disappears
completely
no
doubt
but
the
maltiness
rounds
out
and
the
covers
the
bitterness
over
its
slightly
hazy
golden
body
is
topped
by
a
decentsized
head
of
creamy
white
foam
that
diminishes
shortly
but
leaves
some
thin
lace
in
its
wake
the
nose
displays
some
lager
yeast
sulphur
over
a
bit
of
grainy
malt
and
a
drop
of
floral
hoppiness
the
body
is
light
and
its
gently
crisp
with
a
fine
and
median
carbonation
before
warming
to
become
slightly
creamy
across
the
palate
but
apart
from
its
sulphur
constituent
the
flavor
is
not
much
different
than
most
massproduced
american
lagers
its
lightly
grainy
but
obviously
adjunctinfluensed
character
is
balanced
by
a
firm
bitterness
and
some
dull
leafy
herbal
and
grassy
hops
it
finishes
short
and
dry
almost
like
a
light
beer
theres
not
alot
going
on
here
the
head
made
of
big
frothy
bubbles
was
initially
large
but
quickly
receded
into
a
thin
film
the
lace
made
a
valiant
effort
to
stick
and
wasnt
entirely
unsuccessful
there
was
a
touch
of
citrus
and
cereal
to
the
aroma
but
there
really
wasnt
anything
noticeable
or
noteworthy
about
the
smell
therefore
it
wasnt
surprising
after
taking
the
aroma
into
consideration
that
the
beer
was
virtually
flavourless
the
aftertaste
was
skimpy
lemony
and
slightly
bitter
i
suppose
kirin
is
drinkable
perhaps
as
a
palate
cleanser
when
you
put
an
extra
large
dollop
of
wasabi
in
your
mouth
but
i
dont
see
much
point
in
trying
another
in
23rds
of
the
sushi
bars
ive
ever
been
in
your
beer
choices
are
confined
to
this
and
sapporo
drink
the
sapporo
its
not
great
but
its
better
than
this
medium
gold
color
small
white
foamy
head
aroma
is
grainy
and
very
slightly
sweet
medium
bodied
lager
a
hoppy
somewhat
malty
lager
full
bodied
malty
mouthfeel
is
full
and
round
good
balance
finish
is
clean
and
crisp
aftertaste
is
slightly
bitter
a
rather
weak
lager
that
reminds
me
somewhat
of
a
mixture
of
bud
and
some
weak
eurolagers
unimpressive
thin
aroma
and
taste
of
fruit
and
hops
no
particularly
noteworthy
characteristics
just
factory
beer
simply
unremarkable
stuff
without
being
actively
disagreeable
yawn
this
brew
poured
a
medium
head
of
fine
to
medium
sized
offwhite
bubbles
that
quickly
disappeared
it
had
a
medium
strength
aroma
of
fruit
and
a
smooth
fore
and
after
taste
its
flavor
contained
notes
of
malt
bread
and
roasted
nuts
when
poured
this
brew
had
a
small
white
head
that
consisted
of
small
bubbles
that
completely
diminished
there
was
a
fair
amount
of
lacing
with
this
brew
the
body
was
clear
and
the
hue
was
yellow
it
had
a
light
hoppy
and
fruity
aroma
along
with
a
bitter
flavor
from
start
to
finish
a
bit
sweet
tasting
slightly
slightly
bitter
but
not
much
really
the
mouth
feel
is
quite
watery
no
carbonation
either
sadly
it
goes
downhill
from
there
body
is
weak
taste
is
mildly
of
the
hops
and
wanting
leaves
you
asking
whats
next
please
pours
a
clear
very
pale
golden
straw
color
with
a
foamy
white
head
that
quickly
dissipates
into
a
thin
lace
nose
is
grain
and
rice
with
some
faint
sulfur
notes
taste
is
an
overly
processed
grainy
husk
flavor
and
is
a
bit
astringent
very
light
in
body
this
is
simply
a
bad
beer
several
other
reviewers
mentioned
that
it
goes
well
with
certain
foods
and
that
might
be
true
but
i
drank
it
by
itself
and
its
not
good
alone
and
no
i
do
not
know
what
healthy
piss
in
a
mug
looks
like
tasted
this
beer
in
a
japanese
restaurant
with
food
this
beer
poured
a
golden
colour
topped
by
a
very
poor
head
that
dissapears
very
quickly
no
aroma
and
nothing
special
on
the
flavour
very
poor
japanese
beer
next
time
ill
look
for
alternatives
on
the
menu
it
wont
be
on
my
shopping
list
again
this
looked
like
it
was
going
to
be
really
good
boy
was
i
wrong
it
smelled
and
tasted
like
a
skunk
the
beer
was
a
nice
golden
color
with
a
little
bit
of
a
white
head
to
it
it
had
a
nasty
aftertaste
of
skunkiness
all
in
all
its
a
bad
brew
maybe
i
got
a
bad
batch
of
it
oh
well
im
defiantely
not
going
to
waste
my
time
on
this
anymore
born
on
date
is
21aug02
so
alas
this
is
a
resonably
fresh
sample
on
the
pour
a
crystal
clear
bright
gold
color
the
head
impressive
in
size
white
in
color
with
decent
lace
to
coat
the
glass
malt
nose
clean
and
crisp
the
front
is
sweet
top
skimpy
finish
is
hop
spicy
middling
in
its
acidity
droughty
aftertaste
drinkable
as
lagers
go
but
not
a
real
hit
me
but
then
nine
out
of
ten
lagerspils
elicit
that
reaction
from
this
old
stout
and
belgian
strong
lover
i
think
these
bad
boys
have
corrupted
my
buds
as
in
taste
down
the
drain
it
goes
not
a
striking
sight
with
a
golden
straw
colour
and
foamy
white
head
the
smell
is
a
turn
off
that
is
musty
short
of
stinkyskunky
taste
too
metallicy
for
a
bottled
brew
but
has
hoppy
tones
aftertaste
lingers
a
bit
much
the
feel
is
pleasantly
light
and
airy
but
a
shade
too
biting
it
drinks
better
than
it
looks
or
smells
would
be
best
suited
for
postlawn
mowing
thirsts
i
do
not
know
about
the
sushi
thing
as
i
would
prefer
a
better
beer
for
such
a
meal
i
would
not
trun
my
nose
up
to
it
it
is
beer
afterall
free
leftovers
i
feel
better
than
i
didnt
buy
this
more
golden
in
color
than
the
ichiban
which
i
thought
was
more
tolerable
this
one
had
a
weird
biting
acidic
smell
then
a
simialer
taste
no
really
positive
tastes
mostly
some
acidic
finish
tastes
very
harsh
is
it
the
rice
i
didnt
care
for
it
if
presented
with
a
choice
i
prefer
the
ichiban
owned
by
ab
but
tried
not
to
let
that
influence
the
tasting
pale
color
big
bubbled
head
that
splits
in
an
instant
very
weak
in
most
categories
head
color
flavor
watery
to
the
extreme
though
i
taste
no
corn
characteristics
but
with
such
little
malt
flavor
it
might
benefit
from
a
little
sweetness
it
is
dry
but
the
hops
are
uninteresting
i
had
a
lot
of
kirins
in
japan
as
well
and
it
doesnt
come
off
well
there
either
imo
the
same
as
the
ichiban
but
even
less
interesting
no
flavour
easy
to
drink
boring
for
us
beer
freaks
not
that
great
a
beer
ive
got
to
question
the
brewery
the
bottle
im
holding
says
anheuserbusch
l
a
cali
the
bottle
has
a
bottled
on
date
the
beer
looks
every
thing
like
an
american
macrolager
head
collapsed
into
soap
suds
within
a
few
seconds
tastes
like
bud
dry
awful
label
notes
that
it
is
brewed
under
the
supervision
of
kirins
brewmaster
hey
brewmaster
wake
up
weak
and
watery
notes
a
run
of
the
mill
lager
certainly
not
impressive
but
also
not
revolting
a
very
commercial
example
of
a
modern
day
american
lager
i
must
admit
that
it
pairs
extremely
well
with
sushi
so
its
true
each
beer
has
its
time
and
place
food
match
plain
rice
crackers
flavouring
would
only
serve
to
overpower
this
beer
overall
im
not
a
fan
ive
quite
enjoyed
some
craft
rice
lagers
recently
2
brothers
kung
foo
is
a
case
in
point
but
this
relies
on
buttery
sorachi
to
do
anything
for
it
and
it
just
sort
of
melts
into
the
overall
messiness
not
for
me
exceptional
rice
lager
though
the
lack
of
distinct
aroma
brings
the
rating
down
serving
type
bottle
overall
i
suppose
this
is
a
good
beer
to
nail
before
the
back
nine
on
a
summer
day
ill
stick
to
something
with
a
little
more
flavor
but
its
a
rice
lager
i
guess
and
it
was
refreshing
at
the
very
least
definitely
drinkable
on
a
hot
day
but
on
a
chilly
night
like
tonight
its
little
more
than
an
appetiser
hopefully
the
tokyo
black
ill
follow
this
up
with
has
a
bit
more
guts
to
it
great
summer
beer
ill
be
getting
a
lot
more
of
these
in
next
few
months
those
whove
already
reviewed
this
beer
maybe
give
it
another
shot
its
really
quite
good
and
i
dont
even
particularly
like
lagers
d
drinkability
not
quite
worldclass
or
anything
but
its
a
good
refreshing
and
nicely
hoppy
lager
its
cheap
for
what
it
is
too
recommended
almost
no
head
on
a
boring
pale
golden
color
the
smell
is
of
sweet
fruity
tea
and
caramel
the
taste
is
quite
fresh
sweet
citrus
ginger
maybe
sweet
hints
of
caramel
a
chewy
grassy
hoppiness
in
the
back
of
the
mouth
kind
of
watery
probably
a
good
session
brew
easy
drinking
beautiful
pale
gold
restrained
bitterness
malty
broad
creamy
flavor
tastes
like
creamed
corn
could
not
get
the
taste
out
of
my
mouth
for
a
day
and
a
half
i
went
to
sleep
an
hour
after
drinking
this
beer
because
the
creamed
corn
flavor
was
making
me
feel
bad
and
i
woke
up
an
hour
later
barfing
my
intestines
out
i
felt
like
this
beer
was
trying
to
turn
me
inside
out
this
was
sold
in
a
single
22
ounce
can
for
3something
overall
this
is
a
pretty
decent
adjunct
lager
pours
out
to
a
nice
creamy
white
head
and
falls
down
and
leaves
bits
of
lacing
pale
gold
color
smells
of
clean
grains
and
spicygrassy
hops
flavor
is
crisp
clean
and
refreshing
with
a
nice
hop
background
feels
good
doing
down
light
and
moderate
co2
overall
a
good
choice
to
wash
down
sushi
or
hibachi
its
wet
that
the
best
way
to
describe
sapporo
but
i
feel
this
way
about
this
entire
style
its
a
rice
beer
and
they
are
mostly
devoid
of
all
flavors
mb
bought
a
bottle
of
this
from
tanakaya
in
mejiro
tokyo
poured
into
a
baird
pint
glass
gold
cup
winner
in
japan
and
a
first
for
ricebased
lagers
this
brew
brings
the
rice
to
the
forefront
by
focusing
on
highquality
koshihikari
rice
grains
the
appearance
is
a
light
clear
wheat
that
looks
like
a
sunrise
with
a
thick
white
marshmallow
head
the
flavor
is
definitely
different
from
other
beers
clearly
focused
on
showcasing
a
rice
flavor
it
does
this
supremely
well
and
i
can
almost
taste
the
husks
of
unpolished
rice
it
is
a
very
pleasant
brew
and
i
enjoyed
this
lager
as
much
as
i
would
an
ale
loved
it
pours
an
almost
white
with
a
hint
of
yellow
with
a
very
thin
white
head
no
detectable
aromaneither
hops
or
malt
hops
are
barely
there
and
the
rice
lends
to
a
very
very
light
body
no
finish
to
speak
of
and
mouthfeel
is
very
thin
drinkability
is
low
because
there
isnt
much
to
recommend
this
beer
pours
palest
gold
with
a
watery
white
head
little
lacingretention
light
ricey
aroma
with
fruity
accents
flavor
is
actually
pretty
nice
lots
of
ripe
stone
fruits
provide
a
pleasant
sweetness
the
finish
however
is
ricedominated
like
drinking
rice
paper
i
guess
that
comes
with
the
territory
though
crisp
and
very
clean
due
to
the
lightness
thin
body
and
nice
carbonation
refreshing
and
drinkable
NA

a
thoroughly
average
lager
smooth
to
sip
will
go
quickly
on
a
hot
day
yum
really
light
and
a
bit
sweet
poured
a
semiclear
rich
golden
body
with
one
finger
of
bubbly
white
head
that
quickly
receded
a
very
nice
looking
lager
with
a
richer
color
than
most
examples
of
the
style
very
nice
scents
of
softly
sweet
malt
grainy
malt
a
light
hint
of
rice
and
light
levels
of
earthy
dank
herbal
hops
overall
impression
of
aroma
is
of
a
classic
japanese
rice
lager
very
true
to
form
and
quite
appealing
in
its
delicate
light
aroma
flavor
begins
lightly
sweet
with
soft
sweet
malt
notes
and
light
hints
of
honey
and
a
touch
of
an
earthy
quality
middle
opens
up
with
more
pronounced
flavors
of
honey
and
a
light
green
tea
with
honey
flavor
alongside
softly
sweet
and
bready
malt
and
an
undercurrent
of
earthy
hops
in
the
background

is
lightly
dry
with
notes
of
honey

character
aftertaste
is
mediumdry
with
notes
of
earthy
and
floral
hops
lightly
sweet
honey
and
a
mediumlight
bitterness
overall
impression
of
flavor
is
of
a
fantastic
japanese
rice
lager
that
is
rich
and
flavorful
with
a
nice
balance
of
sweetness
and
dryness
ending
crisp
simply
fantastic
and
other
examples
of
the
style
do
not
compare
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
bodied
with
mediumhigh
prickly
carbonation
and
a
smooth
crisp
feel
overall
impression
of
mouthfeel
is
of
a
very
nice
japanese
rice
lager
refreshing
and
crisp
light
and
balanced
overall
this
is
the
finest
example
of
the
style
i
have
sampled
it
has
a
delicate
and
balanced
aroma
and
flavor
aided
by
the
crisp
mouthfeel
yet
it
is
not
weak
in
aroma
and
flavor
being
both
aromatic
and
flavorful
but
in
subtle
subdued
and
balanced
ways
a
true
example
of
a
truly
japanese
style
of
beer
this
poured
a
slightly
golden
straw
colour
with
a
minimal
white
head
that
quickly
fades
away
leaving
small
islands
of
head
the
nose
is
very
subtle
with
a
hint
of
grassstraw
green
apple
and
a
mild
hoppiness
the
flavour
is
crisp
there
is
a
mild
graininess
and
citrus
that
flavour
wise
leans
to
the
lemonlime
family
but
the
tartness
that
is
more
apple
a
pretty
standard
lager
feel
and
taste
serving
type
bottle
food
match
sashimi
set
and
match
good
while
macking
down
some
cherry
salmon
but
not
much
else
tastes
like
a
solid
adjunct
lager
and
is
actually
quite
pleasing
compared
to
the
usual
japanese
macrobrews
particularly
in
its
lack
of
a
skunky
quality
o
bottle
likely
had
6
months
age
on
it
at
least
still
it
was
pleasant
and
drinkable
enough
for
what
it
is
great
brewing
and
packaging
practices
no
doubt
overall
it
is
what
a
rice
forward
made
beer
is
go
eat
this
with
some
shrimp
crackers
and
its
probably
the
best
pairing
but
it
doesnt
get
more
exciting
than
that
bought
this
in
los
angeles
pours
a
medium
yellow
with
a
nice
white
head
a
fair
amount
of
carbonation
yet
when
i
drink
it
there
is
not
much
carbonation
at
all
almost
flat
this
is
your
typical
malt
beer
that
is
clean
not
much
body
and
nothing
that
stands
out
overall
its
no
premium
german
lager
but
theres
good
flavor
here
and
nothing
off
simple
but
flavorful
enough
could
easily
drink
a
lot
of
this
especially
on
a
hot
day
not
half
bad
much
better
than
sapporo

i
find
this
beer
to
be
a
very
nice
drinking
beer
its
flavors
are
clean
and
very
late
and
represent
the
style
very
well
o
lagers
may
not
be
my
favorite
beers
but
this
is
one
solid
example
of
the
style
overall
not
worth
the
high
pricetag
for
premium
ingredients
fancy
label
or
importation
costs
guessing
all
of
the
above
are
contributing
factors
to
a

so
light

edges
i
really
enjoyed
this
brew
which
is
fantastic
example
of
the
style
o
the
nice
clean
light
beer
has
some
interesting
but
soft
flavors
and
the
touch
of
sweetness
really
helps
im
not
sure
it
was
worth
the
7
99
price
for
500
ml
but
it
was
nice
to
try
ill
avoid
this
one
bland
overly
sweet
bad
beer
bad
bad
beer
naughty
not
really
all
that
bad
however
this
offers
nothing
beyond
the
underwhelming
norm
soulsucking
quasisickly
grain
crispness
an
ironically
foreign
concept
and
overall
just
another
lost
chance
at
crossculture
beer
knowledge
enhancement
overall
despite
this
beers
flaws
and
relative
lack
of
flavor
it
is
stylistically
accurate
and
pretty
easily
drinkable
very
little
flavor
too
a
little
bit
of
dryness
and
a
more
than
a
hint
of
corn
syrup
sweetness
i
guess
its
inoffensive
and
pretty
drinkable
but
not
good
really
what
is
this
my
only
opinion
is
that
its
a
very
generic
pale
brew
brewed
to
be
quaffable
and
devoid
of
flavour
by
someone
who
knew
what
they
were
doing
its
not
unpleasant
its
not
offensive
its
not
undrinkable
its
just
goddamn
boring
as
shit
o
a
nice
drinkable
brew
goes
well
with
sushi
definitely
on
par
with
the
big
name
japanese
beers
o
a
better
sushilager
than
ive
had
in
a
while
taste
is
bland
there
is
the
vegetable
taste
and
a
light
grainy
taste
further
than
that
nothing
really
sticks
out
a
very
low
bitterness
and
a
total
absence
of
a
yeast
profile
no
offflavors
but
capitol
bland
mouthfeel
is
thin
great
for
binging
i
guess
my
impression
is
this
is
less
flavorful
than
even
the
big
japoindusto
brews
not
that
its
bad
just
would
hope
for
a
little
more
sparkle
quite
drinkable
but
but
not
worth
the
extra
price
from
a
sunflower
market
in
santa
fe
overall
this
beer
is
satisfying
it
pairs
perfectly
with
foods
that
have
very
subtle
flavors
from
the
500
ml
bottle
sampled
on
april
23
2011
the
pour
is
a
goldenyellow
tone
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
building
up
to
a
two
inch
fizzy
white
head
that
diminishes
in
short
order
there
are
malts
in
the
aroma
along
with
rice
and
cane
sugar
the
medium
mouthfeel
has
a
slick
creamy
texture
to
it
lots
of
sugar
and
malts
in
the
taste
as
well
with
a
slight
hop
bite
at
the
end
it
reminds
me
of
a
sweeter
becks
beer
is
sweeter
than
expected
mildly
grainy
at
the
finish
light
in
body
mildly
carbonated
on
the
palate
overall
nice
in
feel
and
flavor
not
offensive
overall
weak
in
body
and
flavor
everything
tastes
muted
on
this
beer
ill
drink
the
whole
500
ml
but
nothing
too
special
here
this
used
to
be
the
1
japanese
rice
lager
which
is
why
i
wanted
to
review
it
but
it
is
currently
the
2
and
i
dont
think
i
can
recommend
it
enough
to
bump
it
up
to
1
looks
like
im
off
to
canada
drinkability
very
good
with
food
slightly
sweet
very
satisfying
one
is
enough
t
slightly
sweet
and
malty
with
a
hint
of
citrus
pretty
average
but
id
rather
have
this
than
a
sapporo
or
kirin
a
good
sushi
beer
d
drinkable
and
refreshing
but
overpriced
in
the
states
and
not
as
good
as
some
of
its
competitors
it
was
a
fine
companion
to
sushi
and
soup
but
failed
to
live
up
to
my
expectations
d
i
thought
this
was
actually
pretty
good
a
really
clean
and
easy
to
drink
lager
d
it
is
a
pretty
average
beer
i
wont
be
getting
it
again
poured
from
a
500ml
bottle
into
my
zatec
fluted
glass
had
no
idea
what
i
was
getting
into
as
its
kinda
hard
to
tell
from
the
bottle
though
maybe
id
get
lucky
and
stumble
across
a
hitachino
competitor
or
whatnot
then
i
poured
it
didnt
even
give
it
a
whiff
yet
and
as
i
was
putting
the
glass
down
got
a
nosefull
of
adjunct
sweet
herbal
nastiness
fizzy
yellow
beer
for
wussies
got
about
a
finger
of
very
quickly
dying
white
tacky
head
smells
sweet
grassy
ricey
and
like
youd
expect
from
japanese
beer
taste
is
overbearingly
sweet
giving
me
a
headache
overcarbonated
on
the
mouth
hard
to
drink
hope
i
can
finish
the
pint
not
good
maybe
if
i
had
some
spicy
food
to
go
with
it
am
strongly
wishing
i
did
have
some
sashimi
to
eat
this
with
right
now
a
slightly
sweetslightly
creamy
fish
would
be
a
perfect
match
d
overall
a
good
beer
with
food
wouldnt
drink
it
on
its
own
but
i
will
be
drinking
this
next
time
i
head
to
the
same
sushi
bar
d
great
session
beer
but
not
much
else
have
had
this
beer
numerous
times
and
always
drink
lots
of
it
d
a
slightly
better
version
of
the
standard
japanese
beer
but
at
6
for
a
500ml
bottle
the
price
isnt
justified
however
it
pairs
well
with
japanese
food
and
managed
to
cut
the
saltiness
of
my
miso
ramen
soup
personally
not
my
favorite
style
basically
just
an
adjunct
lager
but
this
beer
is
what
it
is
supposed
to
be
drinkability
i
guess
classic
lagers
taste
almost
no
hops
even
weak
malt
moderate
carbonation
dry
palate
nothing
special
only
refreshes
and
let
you
indulge
on
the
hot
day
serving
type
bottle
i
do
like
the
mouthfeel
to
this
one
though
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
to
it
which
is
good
to
see
and
easily
drinkable
if
you
like
the
style
very
smooth
and
drinkable
beer
with
a
slight
taste
of
hops
i
have
taste
tested
with
friends
and
they
found
it
to
be
very
good
while
somewhat
light
in
body
it
had
a
very
smooth
mouth
feel
it
would
be
a
beer
that
i
would
use
to
celebrate
special
occasions
wish
it
were
more
widely
available
great
with
sashimi
or
sushi
not
really
worth
the
price
increase
over
sapporo
kirin
asahi
orion
etc
d
not
a
very
good
rice
lager
way
too
sweet
overall
its
interesting
but
not
particularly
exciting
or
even
very
drinkable
theres
not
a
lot
of
flavor
going
on
overall
and
yet
it
kind
of
sticks
in
the
mouth
with
fruit
and
sugar
recommended
inoffensive
and
thirst
quenching
except
for
the
initial
skunkiness
taste
is
somewhat
malty
and
has
noticeable
rice
character
the
rice
is
mostly
subtle
and
creates
a
softly
pleasant
flavor
slight
herbal
hop
presence
in
the
finish
feel
is
lightmedium
bodied
and
grainy
with
plenty
of
carbonation
very
crisp
clean
and
dry
finish
drinkability
is
very
good
its
very
refreshing
the
flavor
and
feel
are
both
very
good
the
taste
is
light
with
grain
barely
dominated
by
grassy
faintly
herbal
bitter
hops
giving
a
faint
german
quality
to
the
character
its
clean
crisp
with
brief
aftertaste
its
somewhat
watery
and
thin
but
decent
like
a
more
bittergrassy
watereddown
moosehead
lager
extremely
mild
beer
with
a
light
sweet
profile
but
little
to
recommend
it
the
beer
is
a
clear
light
yellow
with
an
almost
entirely
disappearing
head
the
smell
is
weak
sweet
and
slightly
malty
taste
is
similar
with
a
light
citric
twist
of
bitterness
if
you
close
your
eyes
and
concentrate
its
mostly
just
sweet
and
light
i
enjoy
it
more
than
your
average
cheap
macro
but
theres
so
little
of
interest
to
take
note
of
that
its
hard
to
give
the
beer
a
higher
score
the
flavor
of
rice
is
of
course
present
and
while
its
not
my
favorite
grain
flavor
its
so
mild
that
i
cant
complain
really
the
feel
is
fizzy
but
nice
and
light
which
i
appreciate
with
this
style
its
easy
to
drink
except
you
might
die
of
boredom
from
too
many
so
thats
a
minus
i
definitely
prefer
it
over
a

of
american

thats
not

refreshing

better
than
any

really
is

was

for
something
like
a

have
seen
this
beer
at
ledgers
and
ranch
market
for
the
past
couple
years
but
have
been
too
cheap
to
drop
the
almost
4

hat
i
know
would
be
no
better
than
sapporo
i
was
right
and
now
i
can
afford
one
less

damn
you
japanesse
rice
lager
beer
mouthfeel
is
delicate
if
not
thin
highly
effervescent
really
clean
on
the
palate
but
thats
just
a
result
of
the
lack
of
flavor
drinkable
but
not
that
enjoyable
amazingly
drinkable
and
perfect
for
paring
with
the
more
subtle
nature
of
japanese
food
the
one
your
west
coast
double
ipa
will
overpower
try
it
d
i
feel
that
there
are
other
mainstream
japanese
beers
that
are
much
more
enjoyable
than
this
one
very
floral
fruity
citrus
aroma
with
banana
apple
and
a
dash
of
malt
pours
with
a
large
white
head
that
leaves
in
about
2
minutes
no
lacing
very
sweet
tasting
japanese
beer
almost
as
if
it
had
corn
in
it
which
i
doubt
is
the
case
dry
palate
with
lively
carbonation
nothing
to
seek
out
drinkability
meh
in
my
opinion
this
is
kind
of
a
waste
of
koshihikari
rice
its
great
to
eat
and
it
lends
a
very
nice
delicate
character
to
sakes
but
gets
lost
here
among
the
malts
and
hops
this
is
a
good
lager
but
its
a
good
lager
that
could
have
been
made
from
pretty
much
any
other
cultivar
of
rice
after
tasting
it
the
koshihikari
seems
a
bit
gimmicky
to
me
another
from
uwajimaya
in
seattle
appearance
is
a
light
golden
color
with
a
crisp
head
that
keeps
a
thin
film
on
top
when
dissapated
smells
is
not
typical
of
a
macro
lager
its
slightly
sweeter
with
rice
and
grain
that
is
cleaner
taste
is
somewhat
saline
with
hint
of
rice
and
a
good
cabonation
that
dances
on
the
tongue
finishing
clean
with
a
light
mouthfeel
nothing
to
dramatic
here
just
a
good
one
to
try
nice
label
pours
a
clear
straw
with
almost
no
head
nose
is
slightly
grainy
flavor
is
pretty
subdued
overall
smooth
with
a
slight
grain
influence
feel
has
a
nice
bubble
on
the
tongue
and
a
well
balanced
liquid
feel
very
drinkable
but
keep
the
style
in
mind
mouth
and
drinkability
very
crisp
clean
and
like
the
appearance
clear
easily
drinkable
and
would
obviously
go
well
with
sushi
or
tempura
the
beer
evacuates
the
500ml
brown
bottle
a
clear
gold
the
head
average
in
size
and
bright
white
in
color
the
texture
creamy
as
it
dematerializes
and
the
lace
forms
a
thin
veil
upon
the
glass
nose
is
somewhat
sweet
crisp
and
clean
start
has
a
decent
malt
presence
sweet
with
a
modicum
of
bitterness
light
to
moderate
in
feel
finish
has
a
stern
acidity
hops
light
but
pleasing
and
the
lingering
aftertaste
is
desert
bone
dry
i
must
say
on
average
i
like
japanese
rice
lagers
much
more
than
american
macros
overall
quite
drinkable
good
session
beer
or
drink
with
light
food
one
of
the
better
beers
of
the
style
wow
this
baby
is
sooo
clean
and
crisp
and
refreshing
that
id
love
to
see
this
enter
the
country
in
a
case
of
cans
the
oversized
bottle
will
work
for
now
this
was
what
id
call
a
very
good
version
of
asahi
superdry
say
what
you
want
about
light
lagers
there
are
good
versions
that
exist
that
are
crips
refreshing
and
full
of
flavor
this
is
one
of
them
drinkability
very
easy
going
good
as
a
dinner
brew
or
as
a
working
out
in
the
yeard
brew
the
finish
does
get
worse
as
it
warms
and
flattens
d
nice
beer
to
drink
with
sushi
and
i
can
see
myself
drinking
it
again
d
one
of
the
better
japanese
rice
beers
ive
had
at
the
least
it
stands
out
from
the
pack
and
i
could
pick
it
out
in
a
blind
tasting
easy
overall
nothing
outstanding
or
vaguely
interesting
and
it
suffers
from
some
of
the
worst
aspects
of
the
american
macro
lager
a
reasonably
clean
drinking
brew
that
doesnt
take
much
effort
which
is
suited
to
a
warm
sunny
september
afternoon
in
long
beach
mouth
rice
not
in
a
sake
way
but
like
rice
on
your
plate
has
a
strong
bubbly
mouthfeel
malts
up
front
and
along
sides
of
mouth
almost
to
the
extent
of
a
malt
liquor
has
just
an
inkling
of
a
bitter
finish
with
some
warmth
and
a
chewy
hop
sensation
tingly
with
chili
peppers
and
a
grape
skin
sweetbitter
character
its
an
excellent
beer
for
a
hot
day
in
the
sun
as
long
as
its
served
cold
tastes
like
a
japanese
rice
lager
and
a
fine
one
smooth
and
thirstquenching
after
a
hot
day
the
amazing
thing
about
this
beer
and
i
will
probably
remember
it
for
this
reason
there
are
no
off
flavors
as
i
said
its
probably
an
old
can
but
it
is
still
tasty
and
lacks
the
tap
water
taste
i
get
from
so
many
macros
worth
a
try
its
drinkable
but
not
special
in
any
way
more
could
have
been
done
with
the
ingredients
but
as
is
its
just
mediocre
overall
the
bottle
is
really
pretty
this
beer
is
named
after
a
type
of
rice
famous
in
niigata
where
echigo
is
located
this
rice
is
used
in
the
making
of
the
beer
fyi
echigo
is
also
the
old
name
for
the
area
that
is
now
niigataken
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
overall
a
serviceable
beer
nothing
spectacular
but
its
a
nice
simple
drink
that
goes
well
with
grilled
meats
its
fine
for
what
it
is
but
im
not
going
to
be
craving
it
any
time
soon
o
a
pretty
boring
lager
didnt
disrupt
my
sushi
but
i
wanted
more
from
it
the
beer
pours
a
dark
yellow
color
with
a
nice
even
cap
of
foam
floating
above
the
appearance
is
typical
of
an
adjunct
lager
the
aroma
is
mainly
bready
the
flavor
is
light
and
clean
save
a
few
hints
of
husk
the
adjunct
emerges
a
little
more
as
it
warms
nothing
extraordinary
here
but
it
would
do
well
washing
down
japanese
fare
drinkability
easy
to
drink
should
go
well
with
many
kinds
of
food
no
flavor
to
interfere
with
your
appreciation
of
the
food
on
the
other
hand
theres
not
enough
to
entice
me
to
drink
more
than
this
one
ordinary
but
not
objectionable
you
can
use
this
to
clean
your
palate
in
between
sushi
rolls
and
wasabi
otherwise
it
is
an
unremarkable
rice
lager
without
any
particularly
prominent
flavor
not
to
be
tried
again
unless
maybe
its
the
only
beer
at
a
restaurant
in
japan
dvery
drinkable
i
think
this
is
a
type
of
beer
to
have
a
session
with
i
like
it
a
lot
better
than
say
bud
even
though
it
is
a
rice
lager
not
an
american
definitely
a
nice
one
to
try
especially
if
you
have
doubts
about
asahis
brewing
ability
i
drank
this
beer
exclusively
for
a
couple
months
until
it
got
old
this
beer
had
a
pale
golden
piss
color
with
a
very
frothy
head
plenty
of
lace
left
behind
on
glass
many
many
bubbles
the
smell
was
very
faint
with
a
bready
yeasty
smell
the
taste
is
very
light
and
smooth
mellow
if
you
will
some
what
watered
down
the
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
slick
in
the
mouth
it
goes
down
smooth
and
fast
defiantely
a
chuggable
beer
a
soso
beer
i
prefer
a
sapporo
over
this
for
taste
similar
to
a
kirin
but
a
little
drier
d
pretty
drinkable
as
it
didnt
have
much
flavor
at
all
and
was
nice
and
light
the
scent
was
not
all
that
impressive
aroma
and
flavour
is
simple
malt
and
grains
not
much
in
the
way
of
hops
crisp
but
light
on
the
tongue
good
enough
to
go
with
a
meal
but
nothing
special
in
and
of
itself
it
goes
down
very
easily
so
to
sit
with
a
meal
it
works
very
well
i
imagine
this
going
very
well
with
a
number
of
spicy
dishes
but
its
a
tad
too
sweet
on
its
own
for
my
taste
this
poured
a
pale
clear
yellow
with
moderate
white
head
it
smelled
of
lemon
and
yeast
with
some
hops
it
tasted
like
a
pale
belgian
ale
slightly
lemony
and
yeasty
with
no
malt
it
was
smooth
and
nicely
thick
with
almost
no
carbonation
and
had
a
light
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
overall
it
was
interesting
but
nothing
special
d
watery
so
you
could
put
away
a
few
but
not
all
that
pleasurable
could
be
worse
but
definitely
could
be
much
better
note
this
well
balance
beer
is
far
better
if
you
drink
ontap
and
this
draft
thing
is
better
asahi
than
the
super
dry
you
can
enjoy
this
beer
until
you
drunk
it
is
well
drinkable
something
that
would
go
well
on
a
hot
summer
day
there
is
an
umph
missing
behind
the
taste
as
there
is
no
real
body
to
the
beer
i
would
drink
this
again
but
only
if
someone
else
was
buying
a
nice
refreshing
crisp
rice
beer
that
goes
nice
with
food
as
well
this
one
actually
produces
a
thin
spongy
head
with
some
lacing
it
is
light
transparent
urine
in
color
and
has
the
faintest
aroma
of
peaches
biting
astringincy
brings
in
soapy
yeasty
and
slight
apple
suggestions
ok
but
funky
and
the
mouthfeel
really
stings
like
a
bitch
this
is
way
over
carbonated
the
taste
and
smell
is
that
of
a
tried
and
true
amber
easy
to
drink
and
not
too
obtrusive
only
the
hint
of
hops
but
again
it
was
easy
to
drink
perhaps
a
good
session
beer
for
some
reviewed
040204
and
taken
from
notes
pours
a
bright
yellow
with
a
full
white
head
aroma
of
grass
fill
the
nose
very
light
flavor
slight
sweetness
good
body
for
the
style
finishes
very
dry
for
style
rice
acidic
tinny
notes
overtake
at
the
finish
but
leaves
this
an
okay
drinkable
beer
smooth
drinking
assertive
carbonation
pairs
well
with
sushi
or
grilled
dishes
a
friend
brought
a
bomber
over
to
go
with
a
sushi
dinner
i
did
while
certainly
not
a
remarkable
beer
it
did
go
well
with
the
sushi
it
is
very
clean
smelling
showing
slight
cereal
and
bready
malts
it
has
a
crisp
ricey
dry
flavor
that
for
all
intents
and
purposes
could
be
a
michelob
or
rolling
rock
it
is
very
thin
and
watery
especially
if
your
normal
choices
for
brews
are
barleys
belgians
and
assorted
hop
bombs
i
only
had
a
small
glass
out
of
respect
but
quickly
moved
on
to
a
victory
golden
monkey
for
the
rest
of
the
meal
this
is
a
good
beer
if
you
are
just
looking
for
something
light
with
dinner
that
you
dont
want
to
interfere
with
your
food
or
to
engage
your
tongue
at
all
if
youre
looking
for
a
light
palette
cleanser
other
than
water
this
is
not
a
bad
choice
i
was
in
need
of
a
mood
adjustment
and
opted
for
this
giant
33oz
can
over
the
line
up
of
usual
suspects
i
did
not
have
high
expectations
as
my
only
other
japanese
beer
has
been
sapporo
which
i
hated
pleasantly
asahi
is
a
whole
new
ballgame
the
taste
is
uncommonly
smooth
the
can
describes
this
brew
as
super

really
bland
typical

not
very
good
a
disappointing
beer
with
a
nice
can
nice
aromatic
lager
not
bad
but
not
great
either
drinkable
thats
it
this
is
terrible
just
plain
terrible
good
one
but
nothing
spectacular
just
wasnt
impressed
with
this
beer
definitely
bitter
mouthfeel
and
not
much
body
to
the
beer
the
aroma
that
was
present
was
very
faint
not
the
best
of
its
style
plain
and
simple
beer
i
always
have
an
asahi
with
sushi
as
it
goes
really
well
with
it
color
is
typically
pale
straw
taste
is
crisp
and
clean
not
a
lot
of
hops
little
to
no
malt
smell
is
like
an
american
lager
overall
this
is
one
of
the
better
japanese
beers
i
like
this
beer
served
ice
cold
for
a
beer
made
with
filler
it
is
ok
and
heel
goes
good
with
sushi
and
not
because
i
think
its
supposed
to
its
just
so
light
that
it
helps
cleanse
the
palate
have
you
ever
tried
drinking
something
really
robust
with
sushi
not
me
this
beer
has
its
place
the
japanese
need
the
equivalent
of
a
busch
anyway
i
think
best
of
the
jap
beers
ill
buy
it
again
nothing
intermingling
about
this
one
in
conclusion
a
complete
disappointment
probably
better
to
drink
some
tap
water
with
ice
asahi
super
dry
is
my
favorite
japanese
beer
an
adjunct
like
lager
but
no
worse
than
many
of
the
same
style
a
nice
dry
finish
very
very
bland
almost
watery
not
great
its
almost
like
drinking
water
serving
type
can
i
had
to
do
this
bud
miller
coors
equivalent
of
japan
working
off
old
notes
will
update
with
more
details
ifwhen
i
have
another
there
is
not
much
to
say
about
this
beer
its
carbonated
it
looks
and
tastes
the
way
the
majority
of
people
expect
beer
to
taste
its
far
from
terrible
but
its
just
bland
karakuchi
indeed
a
common
japanese
brew
that
does
not
fair
well
in
the
states
has
a
pretty
good
look
pale
yellow
but
the
smell
and
taste
are
average
not
the
best
japanese
beer
out
there
overall
this
beer
is
kind
of
bland
but
totally
inoffensive
it
went
down
very
easy
this
is
a
good
lawnmower
beer
because
it
quenches
your
thirst
but
i
would
not
seek
it
out
again
as
there
are
better
beers
out
there
i
pretty
good
lager
but
nothing
special
i
am
neutral
on
this
beer
the
beer
is
light
golden
colored
beer
it
has
a
wheat
taste
and
it
goes
down
smooth
this
is
very
popular
beer
so
most
beer
fans
have
already
drank
this
one
like
i
have
if
you
havent
tried
it
what
are
you
waiting
for
got
get
some
a
nice
crisp
lager
with
a
bit
of
a
bite
from
the
hops
again
a
slight
cut
above
the
standard
macro
lager
overall
a
decent
macro
lager
not
mindblowing
but
reasonable
and
refreshing
a
reasonable
price
also
at
au45
a
case
of
24
x
330ml
its
great
for
the
style
is
it
a
complex
hop
bomb
no
so
its
understandable
that
its
rated
so
poorly
but
its
great
when
looked
at
through
the
lens
of
japanese
lagers
solid
beer
nothing
fancy
a
simple
japanese
rice
lager
it
has
a
light
crisp
refreshing
mouth
feel
which
alone
elevates
it
above
most
american
style
lagers
for
me
certainly
doesnt
have
a
complex
or
interesting
taste
so
i
can
understand
why
ba
does
not
rate
it
very
high
but
i
think
they
are
underselling
a
well
made
traditional
japanese
lager
another
decent
beer
with
an
awful
rating
get
a
reality
check

something
can
was
very
enjoyable
with
freshly
caught
new
jersey
crabs
followed
a
founders
harvest
ale
so
maybe
i
was
still
getting
the
hoppy
bitter
aftertaste
from
that
but
this
was
surprisingly
hoppy
very
dry
clean
crisp
and
very
refreshing
no
off
taste
or
aromas
just
good
fresh
regular
dry
beer
kept
going
for
the
glass
soon
as
i
put
it
down
that
says
it
all
overall
i
would
avoid
even
if
you
are
in
a
japanese
place
order
something
else
i
certainly
would
not
classify
this
as
awful
as
i
drank
it
all
but
it
is
relatively
poor
and
nondescript
japan
is
not
known
for
their
beers
i
can
see
why
this
is
a
mostly
tasteless
pilsener
with
a
ricey
aftertaste
looks
ok
and
has
a
decent
palate
as
long
as
you
dont
smell
or
drink
it
its
ok
lets
just
dive
in
for
a
rice
lager
eh
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
straw
topped
by
a
halffinger
of
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
hard
water
wet
grass
a
hint
of
plastic
and
a
tiny
and
evanescent
whiff
of
egg
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
the
egg
thankfully
a
momentary
bit
of
madness
that
never
recurs
still
not
much
goodness
to
be
found
here
the
body
is
a
hefty
light
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
watery
feel
overall
this
stuff
just
isnt
for
me
rice
barley
it
dont
matter
when
it
has
to
be
served
ice
cold
to
enjoy
it
overall
it
was
neat
seeing
this
beer
in
seemingly
every
third
vending
machine
i
encountered
in
tokyo
its
not
really
appealing
to
me
though
id
like
to
find
out
exactly
how
much
rice
they
use
in
this
puppy
because
it
tastes
like
a
lot
but
their
website
suggests
it
isnt
theres
almost
no
malt
backbone
or
hop
presence
at
all
its
kind
of
like
budweiser
which
is
fitting
because
its
the
budweiser
of
japan
overall
i
think
this
is
above
average
compared
to
other
rice
lagers
ive
tried
frankly
im
surprised
that
this
beer
is
not
getting
more
love
here
i
test
a
lot
of
craft
beer
and
this
is
better
than
half
the
crap
out
there
pours
a
clear
straw
color
14
inch
head
of
a
white
color
slight
retention
and
slight
lacing
smells
of
strong
rice
sweet
malt
pale
malt
and
a
hint
of
hops
fits
the
style
of
a
japanese
rice
lager
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
strong
rice
hint
of
hop
slight
sweet
malt
and
pale
malt
overall
weak
appearance
with
the
body
and
aroma
dominated
by
a
cheap
adjunct
character
besides
the
adjunct
there
is
little
to
nothing
else
to
this
beer
a
poor
representation
of
a
japanese
rice
lager
o
actually
for
what
it
is
pretty
enjoyable
i
would
say
certain
characteristics
its
dryness
does
make
it
stand
out
flavorwise
its
fairly
standard
as
far
as
macro
lagers
go
i
am
quite
shocked
to
see
the
bad
reviews
i
love
the
dryness
of
this
beer
to
me
it
is
better
than
sapporo
though
who
can
compete
with
the
sturdiness
of
that
can
well
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
so
wanted
to
give
it
a
thumbs
up
this
minimum
character
ruling
is
annoying
by
the
way
overall
one
of
the
worse
beers
ive
ever
had
will
not
have
this
one
again
asd
poured
a
very
clear
golden
yellow
colour
with
lots
of
large
visible
carbonation
bubbles
pouring
produced
12
of
bubbly
extremely
shortlived
white
head
which
left
no
spotting
or
lacing
down
the
glass
its
aroma
was
quite
mild
sweet
light
malts
with
hops
in
the
background
the
flavour
began
with
a
sweet
light
maltiness
with
a
delayed
impact
moderate
bitterness
after
swallowing
the
beer
and
a
dry
finish
all
very
subdued
the
carbonation
was
quite
active
though
but
stopped
short
of
prickly
and
i
would
describe
the
beer
as
light
bodied
with
a
watery
mouthfeel
in
summary
i
cant
figure
out
why
this
beer
is
so
big
in
japan
its
certainly
not
offensive
in
any
way
but
theres
really
nothing
here
to
bring
me
back
for
another
at
2
60
per
500
ml
can
asd
is
not
inexpensive
im
usually
having
sopporo
with
my
hibachi
but
tonight
i
wanted
to
try
this
asahi
again
does
not
disappoint
finishes
dry
enough
to
accompany
japanese
fare
extremely
well
im
not
sitting
in
my
backyard
with
this
but
this
does
the
job
with
dinner
as
far
as
im
concerned
that
has
to
mean
something
very
crisp
and
clean
taste
though
it
has
a
dull
taste
but
the
rice
adjunct
here
does
not
bother
at
all
its
body
is
too
thin
especially
after
carbonation
slows
down
all
in
all
it
sure
goes
down
well
with
japanese
food
pours
a
pale
gold
in
color
with
a
small
thin
head
that
settles
down
to
around
the
top
of
the
brew
some
spotty
lacing
is
seen
lots
of
small
streaming
bubbles
rise
up
from
the
bottle
during
the
whole
drink
the
light
aroma
is
just
of
some
grains
with
a
hint
of
sweet
corn
the
taste
clean
with
a
dry
slightly
bitter
finish
with
the
high
carbonation
the
aftertaste
is
a
bit
on
the
stinging
side
which
is
over
done
overall
not
a
great
beer
not
great
nor
unpleasant
to
summarize
mehok
i
love
the
33
8oz
can
ill
have
to
get
a
sapporo
premium
soon
to
compare
its
not
a
terrible
style
for
cheap
after
all
home
tasting
12oz
bottle
into
snifter

im
not
really
a
beer
specialist
but
i
know
what
i
like
so
my
overall
score
is
a
3
5
and
im
just
giving
the
other
things
a
3
5
since
you
cant
skip
that
part
worked
well
with
everything
we
ate
beef
pork
chicken
burgers
best
consumed
cold
toward
the
end
of
the
bottle
can
get
somewhat
bitter
when
up
to
room
temp
not
my
favorite
style
but
this
beer
isnt
bad
not
great
though
o
a
decent
and
prototypical
japanese
rice
beer
but
simple
and
not
much
flavor
not
much
of
a
head
tastes
clean
crisp
and
light
not
much
body
but
very
easy
to
drink
could
have
had
3
of
these
easily
not
much
flavor
tasted
like
a
clean
beer
with
not
much
sweetness
or
heaviness
not
sure
why
it
is
rated
so
poorly
but
i
like
it
a
very
popular
beer
in
japan
nicely
paired
had
a
tall
can
at
a
pub
in
calgarys
kensington
area
on
a
whim
pours
a
watery
palejust
this
side
of
light
yellow
shade
with
ample
carbonation
very
aggressively
carbonated
adjunct
lager
so
much
so
that
the
bubbles
burnt
my
lips
a
little
initially
aroma
notes
were
perfumy
and
bright
but
this
quickly
moved
to
a
wet
grain
and
corn
sugar
character
that
one
might
expect
in
such
a
beer
in
all
honestly
though
this
beer
smells
like
little
except
fizzy
water
the
taste
is
a
bit
more
robust
than
the
smell
and
includes
the
expected
wet
grainy
malt
dms
cooked
vegetable
and
a
residual
sweetness
despite
the
super
dry
moniker
along
with
a
tart
yogurt
acidity
and
a
little
peppery
spice
metallic
notes
and
a
rubbing
alcohol
astringency
emerge
in
the
finish
along
with
hints
of
grass
id
say
the
finish
is
indeed
pretty
clean
and
crisp
as
the
bubbles
scrub
the
palate
of
the
sweetcooked
flavors
if
one
is
going
to
judge
this
beer
for
what
it
is
its
probably
a
potent
thirst
quencher
on
a
hot
day
and
in
the
right
frame
of
mind
could
prove
to
be
rather
refreshing
dont
look
here
if
you
seek
complex
fresh
malt
flavors
hops
or
anything
else
associated
with
craft
workmanship
for
what
it
is
supposed
to
be
asahi

i
dont
hate
it

unfortunately
this
beer
didnt

deliver
its
pedestrian
malty
bitterly
bland
aftertaste
at
least
there
was
a
lot
of
it
overall
this
is
a
beer
i
do
not
want
to
come
back
to
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
the
appearance
and
even
the
aroma
wasnt
too
bad
but
the
taste
is
just
wayyy
off
go
for
something
else
overall
i
only
bought
this
beer
to
tick
off
a
beer
style
i
really
didnt
need
to
actually
taste
it
to
review
it
ive
had
this
beer
many
times
just
in
different
packaging
from
different
companies
the
style
description
suggests
moderate
bitterness
and
a
firm
malty
character
this
beer
has
none
of
that
i
like
a
dry
beer
ballantine
ale
and
this
one
does
not
disappoint
if
thats
what
youre
seeking
smooth
clean
and
super
dry
with
little
to
no
aftertaste
ive
only
had
it
from
the
bottle
it
is
not
a
heavy
hearty
brew
by
any
means
and
granted
it
is
on
the
expensive
side
highly
drinkable
because
there
is
nothing
to
this
beer
honestly
tastes
like
flavored
water
inoffensive
but
not
satisfying
as
a
previous
user
has
stated
pours
a
clear
yellow
with
a
foamy
offwhite
head
that
settles
to
a
partial
film
on

of
the
beer
tiny
dots

down
smell
is
of
malt
grain
and
subdued
hay
and
grass

taste
is
much
the
same
with
watery
grain
hay
and
grass
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
very
mild
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
poor
beer
with
aromas
and
flavors
that
get
worse
as
the
beer
warms
up
o
one
of
the
easier
reviews
ive
written
as
there
wasnt
much
to
write
about
the
weird
thing
is
that
i
might
actually
review
it
more
favorably
than
some
other
real
beers
because
it
is
the
least
offensive
beer
ive
ever
consumed
the
bad
ones
are
at
least
flavorful
even
if
i
dislike
them
b
beer
all
the
way
this
is
a
mediocre
beer
pours
a
bland
yellow
with
a
quickly
dissipating
head
too
much
carbonation
smells
a
bit
like
soap
the
taste
isnt
awful
has
more
of
a
malty
flavor
than
the
average
macro
lager
but
has
a
faint
metallic
taste
to
it
as
well
crisp
and
dry
mouthfeel
uneventful
great
in
sake
bombs
refreshing
for
a
hot
spring
day
recommended
as
a
back
up
brew
o
overall
ive
had
this
with
sushi
once
or
twice
though
not
a
fan
of
it
nose
is
pretty
bad
and
while
easy
to
drink
dont
think
youd
want
to
drink
a
ton
of
these
id
prefer
something
like
a
bud
light
to
this
beer
i
like
the
flavor
it
is
decent
with
some
rice
taste
which
adds
a
sweetness
to
the
profile
with
light
yeast
tinges
and
mild
spice
aspect
in
the
very
dry
finish
apropos
overall
a
decent
lager
and
i
wouuld
not
hestitate
to
get
it
again
but
not
above
average
really
just
good
overall
overall
not
something
i
would
seek
out
but
am
not
disappointed
has
a
unique
flavor
that
ill
sit
on
the
fence
whether
i
like
or
not
if
your
in
japan
youll
struggle
not
to
try
asahi
if
not
i
wouldnt
bother
o
nothing
more
than
average
pours
a
pale
straw
color
with
fine
bubbles

the
top
of
the
pilsner
glass

thick

foam
head
the
nose
is
of
sweet
corn
syrup

the
taste
is
like
the
smell
with
a
light
mouth
feel
and
high
drink
ability
not
my
cup
of
tea
and
quite
tasteless
i
am
a
imperial
stout
and
belgian
style
guy
so
lagers
dont
really
impress
me
not
bad
but
not
good
either
easy
drinking
my
watery
odbetter
than
some
worse
than
most
i
think
i
like
it
more
than
sapporo
onothing
specialbut
easy
to
drink
this
is
not
too
bad
overall
with
lively
dry
crisp
and
super
smooth
mouthfeel
by
the
way
overall
a
fairly
standard
lager
style
for
the
most
part
quite
easy
to
drink
nonoffensive
but
nothing
with
tons
of
flavor
overall
impression
would
not
drink
this
one
again
o
i
havent
had
many
japanese
rice
lagers
but
i
guess
its
on
par
for
the
style
for
me
i
probably
wont
seek
it
out
again
but
if
this
was
all
that
served
i
could
probably
tolerate
it
for
that
night
from
the
12
oz
can
as
the
name
implies
this
is
a
dry
beer
the
bee
rpours
a
typical
golden
lager
color
very
average
and
bland
looking
the
aroma
is
pretty
much
nonexistent
the
beer
is
not
bad
though
it
could
be
a
bit
better
but
is
one
of
the
better
japanese
brews
ive
had
ive
never
been
a
fan
of
japanese
brew
asahi
is
a
worthy
addition
to
the
lager
category
and
is
relatively
easy
to
find
in
the
u
s
this
is
quite
bad
i
the
goal
for
light
beer
was
not
very
well
attained
with
the
attempt
at
flavor
here
ending
in
a
stale
imprecise
bitterness
pass
on
this
one
this
is
way
too
sweet
it
honestly
tastes
more
like
apple
juice
than
beer
this
is
definitely
a
one
and
done
ill
avoid
this
in
the
future
nah
id
rather
have
water
with
my
sushi
i
think
pours
pisswater
yellow
with
zero
head
smells
like
metallic
mass
produced
adjunct
crap
but
doesnt
taste
nearly
as
bad
actually
some
nice
tang
in
the
malt
flavor
and
a
sort
of
hoppy
back
end
mouthfeel
is
brutally
light
but
with
enough
carbonation
to
get
the
food
moving
overall
this
is
not
a
craft
lager
but
the
rice
malt
makes
it
unique
to
a
degree
and
its
lightness
makes
it
crazy
drinkable
have
quite
a
few
before
you
realize
you
dont
like
it
ya
know
originally
reviewed

the
beer
pours
a
very
pale

with
a
foamy
white

the
smell
is
almost
nonexistent
i
just
noticed
grain

not

just
a

very
light

not

overall
just

nothing

pretty
much
all
the
same
o
when
you
think
of
japan
you
think
of
many
things
ninjas
mt
fuji
large
doe
eyed
animated
characters
no
one
ever
thinks
beer
i
mean
there
are
several
japanese
breweries
but
they
arent
known
for
their
liquid
libations
except
maybe
sake
d
is
it
worth
paying
microprices
for
though
no
lucky
cavendish
science
fiction
writer
beer
lover
will
order
again
but
only
at
a
japanese
restaurant
and
would
not
buy
for
home
i
am
surprised
given
the
innovative
abilities
of
the
japanese
and
the
unquenchable
thirst
of
the
japanese
that
asahi
has
not
refined
this
formula
better
why
it
has
become
tops
in
market
share
is
beyond
me
maybe
the
price
point
is
low
theres
not
much
of
anything
including
flavor
but
theres
a
unique
taste
and
its
very
light
its
actually
perfect
after
a
large
meal
because
its
so
light
bah
another
boring
lager
all
the
consistency
and
flavour
of
water
along
with
some
unpleasant
undertones
worthless
avoid
it
m
aggressive
carbonation
and
lighter
body
the
crisp
dry
finish
does
deliver
this
has
a
look
and
feel
of
an
american
light
beer
id
only
drink
it
at
an
asian
restaurant
overall
refreshing
but
not
particularly
tasty
sometimes
though
thats
all
you
need
from
a
rice
lager
overall
a
beer
that
you
have
to
try
with
sushi
but
i
am
not
very
keen
on
trying
it
again
not
very
well
rounded
o
good
choice
with
sushi
and
spicy
food
overall
i
liked
it
i
would
rather
drink
rolling
rock
for
the
crisp
and
pale
refreshment
and
not
asahi
wouldnt
pay
a
lot
for
it
but
it
was
crisp
as
hell
probably
a
2nd
place
in
the
if
it
were
super
hot
outside
and
i
were
a
sweaty
mess
and
i
wanted
one
beer
to
go
down
easy
contest
o
just
a
bellow
average
beer
nothing
offensive
though
its
drinkable
but
there
really
isnt
a
good
reason
to
at
8
99
a
six
pack
you
can
do
better
m
light
bodied
with
stingy
carbonation
this
is
a
decent
brew
it
is
fairly
light
but
still
possesses
a
good
amount
of
flavor
overall
insipid
but
not
bad
it
grieves
my
heart
to
realize
that
id
rather
drink
this
than
some
of
the
beer
that
some
local
breweries
produce
o
an
ok
but
overall
disappointing
beer
however
this
would
make
a
decent
thirst
quencher
on
a
hot
day
md
carbonation
is
lower
than
meets
the
eye
remaining
moderate
actually
while
the
body
is
light
for
5abv
without
going
thin
to
be
fair
this
japanese
rice
lager
is
not
of
lower
quality
than
brands
like
bud
or
coors
which
show
far
more
obvious
thinish
impacts
of
rice
adjuncts
this
beer
actually
shows
some
balance
and
a
surprising
presence
of
appealing
maltiness
in
the
middle
that
said
i
guess
this
beer
would
go
down
well
with
any
kind
of
food
rather
than
being
enjoyed
on
its
own
this
is
a
very
dry
beer
its
not
the
best
but
its
my
sushi
beer
of
choice
too
bad
its
canadian
a
beer
for
all
seasons
indeed
overall
only
if
theres
nothing
else
available
not
recommended
d
if
im
trying
to
chug
a
beer
for
refreshment
this
would
be
a
good
call
if
im
trying
to
sit
down
and
enjoy
some
flavor
this
would
be
a
terrible
call
as
far
this
review
is
concerned
im
in
the
middle
this
beer
was
nothing
to
special
i
dont
mind
drinking
it
nonetheless
it
is
a
bit
dry
hense
the
super
dry
i
have
no
problem
drinking
this
beer
when
i
go
out
for
sushi
but
i
tend
to
prefer
sapporo
if
it
comes
down
to
it
this
isnt
a
beer
i
would
recommend
going
out
of
your
way
for
ice
cold
from
a
can
in
an
icebox
might
be
different
not
interesting
in
the
least
but
its
crisp
refreshing
and
palatable
enough
or
at
the
very
least
not
especially
unpalatable
drier
than
sapporo
premium
but
in
the
grand
scheme
of
things
not
much
different
from
most
mediocre
rice
lagers
something
to
pass
on
if
youre
not
a
fan
of
the
style
but
it
works
well
enough
with
sushi
or
salty
snacks
yet
when
the
beer
tastes
good
should
one
worry
about
mouthfeel
or
color
still
not
my
alltime
favorite
but
its
going
back
in
my
fridge
one
day
one
of
my
first
japaneses
beers
ill
keep
on
trying
them
i
doubt
that
i
will
be
giving
this
one
another
try
definitely
something
i
would
advise
others
to
avoid
super
dry
might
be
a
stretch
it
goes
pretty
dry
in
the
finish
but
id
call
it
semidry
overall
its
light
as
expected
with
a
constant
carbonation
keeping
it
from
flatness
id
expect
it
to
be
a
bit
crisper
though
it
is
to
a
point
and
its
not
terribly
lacking
smoothness
either
had
this
in
japan
10
years
ago
picked
up
a
single
at
wegmans
contract
brewed
by
molson
this
time
typical
macro
appearance
and
aroma
some
ricecorngrain
smell
slight
metallic
and
light
taste
mouthfeel
was
easy
drinking
and
reminded
me
enough
of
the
japanese
version
not
so
great
but
at
least
brought
back
some
good
memories
being
the
first
japanese
rice
lager
i
have
tried
i
did
not
have
anything
to
compare
against
from
what
i
can
imagine
others
of
the
style
taste
like
this
would
still
be
about
average
there
is
really
nothing
here
to
get
excited
about
or
repulsed
about
for
that
matter
just
a
bland
flavorless
beer
it
is
what
it
is
and
it
isnt
much
o
a
session
beer
worthy
of
washing
down
some
spicy
mongolian
food
its
certainly
not
my
top
pick
for
an
asian
brew
but
its
not
awful
the
taste
is
nothing
to
be
excited
about
i
know
but
you
can
knock
this
one
glass
after
glass
or
bottle
after
bottle
not
bitter
and
you
can
still
enjoy
the
beer
like
taste
that
it
provides
o
surprisingly
drinkable
japanese
rice
lager
that
i
enjoyed
with
my
sushi
the
flavor
is
minimal
and
not
at
all
enjoyable
i
get
vegetal
quality
the
aftertaste
had
a
decent
amount
of
grassiness
rjt
ok
so
why
is
this
so
expensive
o
nothing
about
this
beer
is
impressive
not
even
when
im
really
thirsty
i
just
dont
get
the
taste
and
its
pricy
as
well
m
the
light
body
and
mild
sweetness
aided
in
cutting
through
the
fiery
dinner
a
good
drink
that
does
justice
to
asian
cuisine
clear
golden
with
a
two
finger
white
head
that
quickly
disappears
smell
is
awful
grassy
with
a
little
skunk
to
it
taste
is
horrible
rice
and
grass
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
watery
overall
about
what
i
expected
i
hope
not
all
rice
beers
are
this
disgusting
beer
is
light
in
body
with
a
mild
sweetness
the
label
says
super
dry
on
it
but
this
must
be
a
loose
translation
because
this
beer
is
not
super
dry
mildly
dry
is
what
i
would
have
called
it
with
a
slightly
tiny
bitter
finish
unoffensive
but
unremarkable
what
a
loser
style
boring
dry
yes
it
is
super
dry
no
sake
is
super
dry
this
is
just
dry
it
is
crisp
and
refreshing
when
cold
but
i
bought
the
33
5
ounce
can
so
its
a
bit
warmer
now
despite
the
flaws
in
this
beer
i
still
managed
to
finish
all
33
5
ounces
i
should
seek
help
this
isnt
amazing
ill
stick
to
sapporo
if
i
want
a
change
from
my
generic
north
american
lagers
dit
serves
its
purpose
as
a
very
light
and
refreshing
beer
but
if
i
wanted
a
beer
this
light
id
probably
just
drink
water
t
a
watery
beer
light
body
sweetness
at
first
tiny
bitterness
but
is
kind
of
flat
all
the
flavour
not
end
at
all
refreshing
crisping
on
tongue
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
brew
was
the
look
while
there
was
no
outstanding
coloring
the
beer
looked
the
part
for
the
style
it
looked
appropriate
with
an
unexpectedly
showy
head
in
the
end
however
it
fell
majorly
when
it
came
to
aroma
and
taste
neither
were
full
or
bold
and
did
little
to
invite
the
drinker
in
for
more
overall
itll
do
when
youre
eating
sushi
but
id
avoid
it
for
regular
everyday
drinking
second
beer
tried
during
my
layover
in
hong
kong
whilst
on
my
way
to
singapore
asahi
super
dry
was
much
better
to
me
than
tsingtao
the
appearance
is
average
nice
clear
golden
color
with
good
carbonation
the
smell
is
ok
not
over
the
top
with
grain
the
taste
is
smooth
subtle
grain
comes
off
the
pallete
clean
and
crisp
dry
the
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
is
ok
as
well
very
easy
to
drink
clear
yellow
straw
color
fluffy
head
that
dissipates
quickly
but
it
does
have
some
nice
lively
carbonation
not
much
of
an
aroma
bit
of
straw
and
grain
flavor
is
obviously
light
and
mostly
flavorless
but
i
am
not
picking
up
on
much
in
the
way
of
off
flavors
or
bitterness
maybe
my
palate
is
a
bit
compromised
right
now
since
i
am
broke
and
have
been
drinking
mostly
cheap
beer
i
am
looking
at
you
goldmine
but
as
a
cheap
macro
lager
i
really
dont
mind
this
at
all
its
not
going
to
set
the
world
on
fire
but
i
would
drink
it
again
as
an
affordable
lawn
mower
beer
i
love
my
california
ipas
and
my
muddy
imperial
stouts
but
sometimes
you
just
need
something
simple
at
the
end
of
the
day
my
usual
is
a
pabst
with
a
shot
of
rye
or
2
however
i
found
that
asahi
along
with
a
shot
of
rye
is
quite
satisfying
i
cant
put
a
finger
on
it
but
i
think
its
that
metallic
taste
people
complain
about
i
guess
i
kind
of
like
it
ill
probably
come
back
to
this
when
i
feel
like
a
plain
old
macro
lager
meh
12
oz
can
into
a
pint
glass
this
is
an
interesting
beer
because
what
it
purports
to
be
is
pretty
much
tasteless
its
crystal
clean
and
theres
nothing
objectionable
going
on
its
basically
intended
to
be
beerwater
that
goes
with
anything
its
easy
to
swig
these
down
theyre
pretty
smooth
drinkers
not
a
bad
beer
to
have
around
im
probably
biased
sentimentally
a
little
bit
from
drinking
these
out
of
vending
machines
on
a
trip
to
japan
when
i
was
17
overall
not
terrible
but
not
good
wish
it
had
more
flavor
because
it
is
quite
refreshing
and
if
it
had
the
flavor
to
back
it
up
it
would
be
bad
at
all
it
appears
that
the
pretense
and
snobbery
of
craftbrewgestapo
affectations
has
overpowered
the
ability
to
objectively
analyze
somethings
enjoyability
mild
refreshing
beers
are
not
bad
theyre
a
different
style
and
we
should
look
to
rate
beers
according
to
how
well
they
embody
a
style
or
accomplish
a
purpose
and
this
beers
purpose
is
to
be
well
carbonated
light
and
refreshing
which
it
is
through
and
through
o
a
very
poor
beer
id
take
a
budmillercoors
product
over
this
any
day
o
the
drinkability
here
isnt
very
good
but
its
not
the
worst
either
i
would
choose
this
over
some
of
the
other
macros
available
for
sure
the
taste
isnt
too
offensive
just
dont
let
it
warm
and
it
goes
down
fairly
easy
id
drink
one
again
if
some
one
offered
me
one
but
i
wouldnt
spend
money
on
it
again
tastes
sweet
biscuity
malt
and
somewhat
like
carbonated
rice
water
and
the
mouthfeel
is
just
carbonation
not
noticing
any
dryness
out
of
the
ordinary
nothing
special
here
pours
a
golden
straw
color
no
head
to
speak
of
had
a
metallic
taste
for
sure
and
it
just
seemed
to
linger
on
the
tongue
which
was
unpleasant
reminded
me
a
lot
of
a
us
macrobrew
budweisercoors
but
with
that
strange
metallic
taste
to
it
had
a
faint
grain
taste
to
it
but
just
barely
not
something
i
would
drink
again
overall
meh
dont
have
a
big
frame
of
reference
for
this
style
but
to
me
it
falls
somewhere
in
the
macro
continuum
alongside
coors
and
heineken
drinkable
but
really
not
doing
a
lot
for
me
wasnt
able
to
get
much
of
a
rice
flavor
from
this
ive
had
other
beers
from
japan
that
do
have
flavors
of
rice
in
it
anyway
this
beer
was
another
pale
yellow
in
color
lager
the
smell
of
malts
are
all
that
i
got
out
of
it
no
aroma
of
hops
my
favorite
thing
about
this
beer
is
the
label
overall
not
the
greatest
beer
but
its
simple
and
works
if
your
thirsty
and
its
hot
out
grab
a
tall
can
of
this
nice
break
from
some
moree
complex
beers
pours
a
pale
straw
color
with
fine
bubbles
rising
to
the
top
of
the
pilsner
glass
forming
a
thick
sea
foam
head
the
nose
is
of
sweet
corn
syrup
and
malt
the
taste
is
like
the
smell
with
a
light
mouthfeel
and
high
drinkability
d
this
is
very
drinkable
and
doesnt
have
a
terrible
taste
if
it
was
a
little
cheaper
it
would
be
a
viable
party
option
it
looks
like
a
fizzy
bmc
product
doubtless
the
nose
however
well
it
actually
has
substance
much
more
so
than
i
would
expect
from
a
jrl
the
taste
is
there
too
i
get
some
honeyfloral
sweetness
very
restrained
but
still
readily
discernible
there
is
a
fair
amount
of
sweetness
here
for
something
labeled
as
super
dry
although
it
is
not
sugary
sweet
in
any
sense
the
sweetness
is
a
product
of
the
nature
of
flavor
suggestions
i
e
honey
flower
blossoms
ricesakejasmine
etc
good
stuff
at
any
rate
feels
good
easy
drinking
i
will
always
order
this
from
now
on
at
the
japanese
steakhouse
no
more
sapporo
or
kirin
thankfully
and
id
take
this
over
chang
or
singha
by
a
smaller
margin
as
well
drinkability
by
itself
as
i
had
this
one
it
is
not
impressive
just
not
enough
here
to
interest
me
but
with
food
it
should
do
fine
not
quite
up
to
par
with
sapporo
but
id
order
it
at
a
sushi
restaurant
and
just
may
buy
a
sixer
when
im
looking
for
an
easy
drinking
beer
in
the
summer
months
i
dont
imagine
it
would
be
as
enjoyable
on
its
own
but
with
spicy
or
boldflavored
food
i
think
it
works
pretty
well
so
from
my
limited
experience
of
japanese
beers
they
tend
to
be
crisp
yet
malty
dry
yet
soothing
basically
something
like
this
except
brewed
in
japan
in
australia
we
have
three
common
japanese
brews
available
however
none
of
them
are
actually
brewed
in
japan
this
is
brewed
in
thailand
sapporo
is
brewed
in
canada
and
kirin
ichiban
is
brewed
here
in
australia
for
the
record
i
have
experienced
the
proper
asahi
from
a
delightful
1l
can
and
it
deserves
better
than
the
c
rating
which
this
version
should
earn
much
more
crisp
and
vibrant
drink
that
one
if
you
can
notes
simple
plain
and
yes
dry
d
its
as
drinkable
as
it
gets
nice
to
have
around
for
a
hot
summer
day
or
if
you
just
want
to
quaff
standard
dry
beer
seems
to
go
best
with
asian
food
still
despite
the
novelty
of
a
rice
beer
this
one
ended
up
tasting
watery
and
just
about
as
average
as
can
be
d
barely
not
exactly
something
one
should
endeavor
to
quaff
on
its
own
but
easy
enough
to
put
back
alongside
some
spicy
japanese
fare
the
kind
made
for
accommodating
or
maybe
viceversa
the
kind
of
hideous
sweet
and
tangy
character
of
this
offering
im
guessing
super
somehow
translates
to
now
less
sickly
malty
and
with
a
metallic
offset
instead
pardon
my
french
i
thought
the
japanese
brewed
version
might
have
been
better
than
the
os
brewed
versions
i
have
tried
but
if
anything
it
was
worse
you
really
have
to
love
beer
to
appreciate
the
nuances
in
appearance
and
smell
although
i
agree
with
my
counterparts
that
the
beer
may
be
lacking
in
appearance
its
the
bottle
itself
shining
the
advertisement
of
the
brew
itself
i
enjoyed
it
thoroughly
the
brew
has
a
rice
taste
quality
to
it
and
it
wasnt
a
pun
by
identifying
the
brew
by
the
manufacturer
as
satiny
smoothness
went
down
well
to
me
as
long
as
the
beer
tastes
reasonable
then
its
worthy
of
my
session
you
wouldnt
be
disappointed
d
it
drank
very
good
cause
it
was
thin
in
body
and
went
very
good
paired
with
sushi
and
shrimp
tempura
drinkability
well
i
like
to
give
each
beer
a
fair
review
and
i
respect
all
brewers
but
i
probably
wont
be
visiting
this
beer
again
some
may
like
it
and
im
sure
it
has
its
place
but
its
just
not
the
beer
for
me
im
better
off
having
tried
it
though
nothing
to
really
brag
about
here
but
it
is
better
than
some
bmc
products
ive
had
i
wouldnt
recommend
this
unless
you
just
want
ti
try
a
japanese
rice
lager
a
bog
standard
lager
beer
delivers
exactly
what
it
says
a
dry
pale
lager
only
down
sides
were
that
it
went
flat
quicker
than
i
would
have
liked
that
it
wasnt
exciting
in
any
way
no
doubt
ill
try
it
again
sometime
in
the
future
if
the
price
is
right
just
really
nothing
to
write
about
supremely
watery
on
par
with
many
macros
12
oz
bottle
from
japanese
restaurant
pours
corona
color
with
hay
grassy
nose
and
metallic
skunky
hoppy
taste
no
malt
balance
in
this
brew
at
all
i
really
had
to
struggle
to
finish
the
bottle
i
think
i
would
be
much
better
off
ordering
heineken
pours
a
light
golden
yellow
color
with
a
thick
nonrelenting
white
soapy
head
with
a
little
lacing
smells
of
rice
and
a
little
hops
aroma
tastes
of
rice
with
strong
notes
of
fresh
cut
grass
and
some
hidden
hops
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
but
the
carbonation
is
decent
drinkability
is
pretty
high
people
gotta
take
into
account
the
style
there
arent
many
examples
of
japanese
rice
lagers
and
from
the
three
or
four
ive
had
this
is
easily
the
most
refreshing
and
unique
was
my
staple
beer
of
choice
years
ago
before
i
discovered
sam
adams
and
craft
bland
but
good
for
sake
bombs
if
nothing
else
d
despite
having
a
little
more
of
a
distinctive
flavor
than
most
runofthemill
macros
it
did
not
go
down
as
smoothly
to
me
might
just
be
the
difference
in
japanese
vs
american
lagers
as
i
know
many
people
who
really
like
this
beer
pours
an
average
lager
gold
with
tons
of
carbonation
and
a
head
that
disappears
quite
rapidly
tastes
of
strong
hops
and
a
hint
of
metal
has
a
very
strong
aftertaste
that
lingers
for
a
while
then
turns
kinda
gross
the
beer
is
slightly
bitter
but
its
ok
its
still
refreshing
when
cold
on
a
hot
day
p
i
think
any
beer
is
except
light
beer
unless
you
want
water
this
beer
is
way
too
over
carbonated
but
i
could
and
the
aftertaste
isnt
really
the
best
but
you
know
what
overall
i
would
say
its
drinkable
nothing
terrible
about
it
but
it
could
use
some
work
not
bad
yet
not
great
a
refreshing
enough
brew
to
knock
back
a
tray
of
sushi
but
nothing
substantial
no
not
really
recommended
unless
you
dont
want
a
beer
that
is
as
unobtrusive
as
possible
not
something
i
will
take
again
drinkability
i
can
drink
this
as
quickly
or
slowly
as
a
feel
like
and
i
dont
lose
the
flavor
or
become
overwhelmed
the
lightest
beer
i
have
seen
in
my
life
it
is
almost
transparent
it
looked
like
someone
mixed
a
20oz
bottle
of
water
in
a
12oz
beer
the
head
is
almost
nonexistent
the
nose
doesnt
really
exist
either
the
taste
is
thin
and
watery
a
metallic
taste
lingers
on
the
finish
i
would
have
to
say
the
highest
quality
of
this
beer
is
the
drinkability
only
because
of
the
lack
in
taste
so
it
seems
asahi
is
nothing
different
just
another
dull
lager
brewed
for
the
unbeereducated
atmosphere
is
ok
it
has
a
pretty
solid
appearance
all
in
all
nose
is
not
much
to
talk
about
except
for
this
faint
rotten
aroma
that
emanates
from
it
flavor
nothing
to
speak
of
nothing
really
there
and
a
rubbery
aftertaste
overall
this
is
not
so
great
a
quaff
my
question
is
why
is
this
beer
so
popular
in
japan
advertising
and
prevalence
would
be
my
guesses
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
first
time
i
have
tried
a
japanese
beer
the
rice
lager
pales
a
pale
yellow
and
shows
plenty
of
carbonation
showing
thru
slightly
malty
smell
and
small
amounts
of
lace
stayed
on
the
glass
the
beer
is
not
overly
complex
and
leaves
a
bitterness
as
you
drink
the
beer
is
a
little
bit
watery
and
drinkable
but
not
something
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
the
taste
is
very
mild
grain
specifically
a
definite
cooked
rice
character
and
indeed
rather
dry
with
little
sweetness
or
bitterness
it
has
a
rough
character
in
the
middle
with
water
metallic
quality
and
only
a
mild
rice
aftertaste
bland
up
front
it
gets
a
little
flavour
in
the
middle
but
by
the
finish
completely
loses
all
character
of
any
sort
for
an
abrupt
and
utterly
tasteless
watery
finish
before
its
mild
aftertaste
even
for
the
style
it
is
extremely
watery
with
a
rough
unpleasant
palate
it
tastes
like
a
basic
beer
quality
but
only
just
barely
d
yep
im
admitting
to
being
a
ticker
here
it
alright
but
not
great
if
you
want
rice
in
your
beer
just
get
a
bud
great
lightmedium
body
smooth
slightly
grainy
finish
went
well
with
mixed
vegetables
dressed
with
a
kung
pao
peanuts
sauce
much
better
than
most
macro
american
lagers
notes
from
1204
would
only
try
this
again
for
the
novelty
of
small
sized
cans
this
was
pretty
bad
d
interesting
beer
i
could
have
had
another
d
an
average
reminds
a
little
bit
of
tsingtao
if
you
like
a
dry
aftertaste
and
rice
beers
this
will
do
the
trick
fairly
typical
of
the
style
this
is
a
refreshing
session
beer
with
the
familiar
flavor
of
rice
lagers
at
their
worst
industrially
produced
lagers
can
be
distasteful
unpleasant
notably
cheap
products
that
the
average
nonbeer
drinker
will
find
repellent
at
their
best
they
are
neutral
unmemorable
pedestrian
beverages
that
even
the
general
public
should
find
inoffensive
this
is
closer
to
the
latter
although
not
by
that
much
note
that
like
most
beers
this
is
far
better
ontap
and
fresh
though
common
in
japan
but
ive
only
seen
superdry
in
bottles
in
the
u
s
im
also
a
bit
skeptical
of
the
consistency
in
other
markets
many
of
the
reviews
here
note
that
they
were
of
bottles
which
were
brewed
by
other
breweries
under
contract
and
given
that
even
the
bottled
version
of
superdry
is
pretty
good
in
japan
it
seems
quite
plausible
that
some
of
these
contract
brewers
just
arent
doing
a
very
good
job
notes
its
a
good
tasting
beer
i
for
one
like
the
taste
of
a
rice
lager
but
i
can
understand
why
a
lot
of
guys
dont
i
wouldnt
mind
having
it
with
some
sushi
or
japanese
food
it
has
its
own
flavor
and
character
and
it
goes
down
well
golden
pour
nose
was
of
weak
lager
nothing
stands
out
little
bubbly
head
dissipates
quickly
flavor
is
better
than
the
smell
label
says
ultra
dry
which
i
usually
associate
with
being
less
sweet
this
definitely
has
a
sweet
underlying
flavor
not
hoppy

asahi
super
dry
is
not
good
beer
its
consistent
with
my
other
limited
experience
with
the
style
its
also
very
consistent
with
adjunctmacro
lagers
lacking
in
just
about
every
respect
id
offer
constructive
criticisms
but
that
would
require
a
complete
overhaul
here
it
needs
a
substantial
amount
of
work
but
i
suspect
its
just
as
it
was
intended
beer
for
people
who
really
dont
like
beer
not
recommended
overall
a
boring
bland
beer
drinkability
its
strongest
point
is
certainly
its
drink
ability
as
its
so
light
and
crisp
that
you
could
really
throw
this
back
quick
would
be
one
not
to
really
savor
the
flavor
but
reminiscent
of
a
macro
that
you
would
just
be
using
to
throw
back
quick
not
terrible
but
not
great
this
beer
is
a
prime
example
of
higher
cost
not
always
giving
better
product
i
bought
this
thinking
it
would
have
more
to
offer
than
other
japanese
beers
ive
had
i
definitely
will
not
be
trying
this
again
final
thoughts
i
knew
when
i
bought
this
beer
it
would
be
a
disappointment
but
i
figured
have
an
open
mind
dont
judge
it
till
you
try
it
well
i
tried
it
and
needless
to
say
i
wasnt
surprised
this
beer
is
tolerable
but
not
much
else
id
drink
it
if
is
was
the
only
beer
available
but
other
then
that
its
not
worthwhile
it
will
be
some
time
before
i
chance
a
japanese
style
again
that
is
for
sure
i
like
substance
and
flavor
so
this
did
not
meet
my
cut
i
believe
that
there
is
no
beer
in
the
world
that
deserves
an
f
as
i
love
beer
too
much
to
fail
one
and
no
matter
how
bad
a
beer
is
it
could
likely
be
safer
than
local
water
of
the
area
but
this
was
pretty
bad
and
not
worth
the
premium
price
while
admittedly
not
an
amazing
beer
its
definitely
a
very
nice
cheap
drink
that
goes
really
well
with
japanese
food
i
only
wish
that
the
domestic
version
tasted
true
to
the
original
this
beer
is
more
tasty
and
refreshing
than
i
had
expected
and
puts
up
a
damngood
drinkability
factor
but
again
its
also
either
make
or
break
with
a
personal
opinion
if
you
dont
like
really
dry
beers
you
probably
shouldnt
even
be
trying
this
in
the
first
place
but
if
you
do
and
you
are
looking
to
try
something
a
little
different
i
could
recommend
this
for
what
its
worth
this
beer
has
me
a
little
curious
about
higher
caliber
brews
of
this
style
im
glad
i
didnt
pay
for
it
taste
is
better
than
the
smell
indicates
still
quite
light
in
flavor
but
it
is
crisp
with
a
dry
finish
i
can
actually
discern
some
hop
flavor
and
bitterness
here
i
would
take
this
over
bmc
light
beers
any
day
not
super
but
could
do
plenty
worse
for
a
saki
bomb
accompaniment
pours
a
typical
lagerish
clear
yellow
ok
white
head
aroma
is
crisp
simple
not
too
strong
flavor
is
crisp
strong
malty
better
than
most
macro
lagers
if
lacking
in
complexity
texture
is
fairly
smooth
and
firm
not
at
all
watery
not
great
but
acceptable
drinkability
the
best
tasting
beer
of
the
group
of
asian
beers
i
recently
tasted
i
would
enjoy
having
this
again
although
not
necessarily
regularly
conclusion
it
is
what
it
is
its
not
a
style
that
lends
itself
to
greatness
or
even
mediocrity
imo
and
this
is
average
at
best
for
the
style
d
at
least
its
pretty
to
look
at
not
worth
a
revisit
had
this
with
my
buddy
that
told
me
that
this
is
his
favorite
japanese
beer
i
was
less
than
impressed
gold
color
poured
in
glass
with
little
head
smell
not
really
taste
was
even
more
disappointing
with
no
real
discernible
flavors
was
carbonated
i
wouldnt
want
another
one
of
these
for
free
an
average
beer
overall
but
for
these
parts
its
good
enough
this
beer
is
simply
too
dry
and
left
me
extremely
thirsty
after
drinking
it
it
pours
a
light
yellow
and
has
a
bitter
smell
with
a
small
fizzing
head
its
almost
impossible
to
notice
any
sort
of
taste
because
the
liquid
almost
immediately
evaporates
after
hitting
your
tongue
aroma
is
lightly
malty
with
alcohol
it
has
an
average
head
but
has
some
clumps
in
it
after
it
subsides
very
little
lacing
golden
amber
color
typical
for
pale
lagers
taste
is
a
little
weak
and
the
only
thing
that
save
this
is
the
unique
hops
too
bad
there
is
not
much
of
them
to
taste
brief
maltiness
in
the
finish
aftertaste
is
almost
non
existent
but
being
a
super
dry
beer
that
would
be
expected
pretty
so
so
at
best
decent
carbonation
lighter
bodied
but
enough
flavor
to
know
youve
had
a
sip
fights
through
the
saltyginger
flavors
of
decent
sushi
overall
i
could
have
had
seltzer
or
stuck
with
tea
and
gotten
the
same
effect
greasy
italian
food
last
night
and
this
for
lunch
im
done
for
the
day
pours
a
light
yellow
colored
body
and
a
small
white
head
mm
a
malty
aroma
fresh
taste
is
clean
and
nutty
watery
mouthfeel
refreshing
a
little
alcoholy
a
little
dry
but
not
too
bad
overall
eh
a
lager
but
more
flavor
than
most
big
brother
beer
d
good
for
what
it
is
preferred
to
many
american
light
beers
a
good
sushi
bar
brew
the
smell
was
grainy
and
of
lemons
the
taste
was
plain
and
grainy
it
was
pretty
dry
and
moderately
carbonated
overall
not
bad
for
its
purpose
washing
down
some
sushi
theres
really
very
little
to
say
about
beer
like
this
as
it
doesnt
excel
or
leave
a
lasting
memory
in
any
area
not
even
that
great
when
compared
to
some
of
the
other
japanese
beers
in
its
class
looking
back
on
this
review
in
2010
ive
finally
come
across
a
good
rice
lager
brewed
in
toronto
and
it
really
highlights
the
potential
of
the
style
that
the
big
brewers
have
missed
out
on
it
also
makes
this
swing
and
a
miss
all
the
more
disappointing
i
could
definitely
drink
this
in
large
quantities
if
presented
with
them
part
of
me
has
a
liking
for
this
because
i
just
like
beer
in
general
but
i
know
when
im
standing
in
front
of
the
cooler
i
will
not
choose
this
one
often
theres
little
reason
that
they
couldnt
drop
the
price
on
this
in
which
case
id
think
about
it
when
looking
for
budget
beer
i
could
see
it
going
well
enough
with
food
and
i
reckon
i
prefer
this
over
sapporo
draft
if
given
the
choice
its
pretty
refreshing
mainly
due
to
being
hoppier
and
drier
than
other
macros
bud
or
if
your
feeling
charitable
bud
select
there
isnt
much
else
to
say
about
the
beer
spending
time
in
consideration
of
its
various
qualities
is
sort
of
like
thinking
hard
about
a
number
2
pencil
its
there
you
know
what
it
is
there
isnt
really
anything
more
to
it
its
also
dull
unimaginative
and
worth
not
even
drinking
beer
if
its
your
only
option
there
really
isnt
much
else
to
say
you
get
the
point
dont
buy
it
to
be
fair
you
could
do
worse
the
beer
may
even
be
slightly
better
than
i
have
listed
but
at
some
point
there
is
no
point
bogus
beer
is
just
that
and
not
worth
your
dollar
after
the
sapporo
this
just
didnt
make
the
cut
pale
yellow
fizz
in
the
glass
with
a
white
foam
that
quickly
disappeared
a
mild
beer
smell
in
the
nose
watery
and
bubbly
with
a
mild
malt
and
subtle
fruity
hops
taste
reminded
me
of
a
us
light
macro
just
didnt
have
the
same
quality
as
some
others
a
lot
of
variety
in
japan
apparently
so
it
would
be
interesting
to
try
some
of
them
there
and
since
you
can
buy
beer
from
vending
machines
it
sounds
like
my
kinda
place
nihon
ni
ikou
ka
decently
drinkable
but
thats
just
because
its
unoffensive
pours
a
nice
bright
gold
with
a
small
fizzy
white
headdont
blink
you
may
miss
itno
lacing
eitheri
really
wasnt
expecting
any
if
i
was
blindfolded
i
would
swear
there
was
apple
juice
in
my
glassit
smells
sweet
and
has
a
little
tangy
earthy
smell
that
is
mildly
intriguing
the
taste
is
not
offensive
and
does
go
well
with
food
some
fresh
grainy
flavors
are
the
first
to
appearfollowed
by
some
nice
grassyslightly
bitter
hop
dryness
overall
i
could
drink
a
couple
of
these
and
enjoy
them
againasahi
was
the
best
part
of
this
crappy
little
buffet
expierience
all
in
all
it
was
average
it
had
a
clean
and
crisp
character
but
otherwise
wasnt
worth
what
i
paid
for
it
drinkability
easy
yet
unenjoyable
this
beer
is
very
forgettable
di
would
not
order
this
again
sopporo
for
me
with
my
sushi
or
habachi
drinkability
isnt
bad
for
this
brew
it
goes
well
with
sushi
and
other
japanese
foods
but
as
a
brew
to
drink
this
summer
id
only
drink
it
during
special
dinners
good
level
of
drinkability
due
to
the
lack
of
cloying
flavors
and
low
abv
its
thin
its
got
no
positive
character
to
speak
of
and
it
is
skunked
on
the
nose
and
yet
the
clean
finish
and
dry
character
end
up
making
it
quite
refreshing
and
against
my
spicy
tuna
roll
and
hibachi
steak
and
shrimp
combo
it
goes
rather
well
complimenting
also
the
crafty
chef
building
onion
ring
volcanoes
and
flipping
shrimp
into
his
toque
in
that
scenario
the
gleaming
silver
33
ounce
can
isnt
an
unwelcome
companion
outside
of
that
however
well
lets
just
say
that
most
beers
have
their
places
and
this
ones
is
in
the
hibachi
restaurant
enough
said
d
very
drinkable
with
this
type
of
meal
i
was
very
satisfied
but
ill
go
with
sapporo
next
time
this
lager
pours
a
light
golden
color
and
holds
a
poor
whitish
head
the
nose
is
mostly
ricey
malts
and
stale
hops
the
taste
unfortunately
is
not
much
different
really
light
with
rice
and
grass
a
watery
body
is
highly
carbonated
not
the
most
drinkable
brew
as
it
does
not
taste
very
good
tried
this
one
at
a
japanese
steakhouse
came
out
bright
yellow
with
a
two
finger
quickly
fading
head
smell
of
faint
corn
rice
grain
nothing
exciting
taste
a
touch
malty
then
immediately
disgusting
big
bubbles
makes
it
hard
to
enjoy
definitely
doesnt
pair
well
with
the
otherwise
good
tasting
food
asahi
is
made
by
molson
under
the
supervision
of
asahi
beer
after
i
saw
that
i
was
upset
i
just
ordered
a
macro
that
said
there
was
a
slightly
different
yeast
taste
in
this
beer
that
made
it
at
least
drinkable
it
was
obviously
very
clear
and
light
the
subtle
differences
definately
propelled
this
above
the
standard
molson
but
it
was
nothing
special
drinkability
here
is
average
if
someone
has
it
and
offers
it
i
wont
turn
it
down
however
i
might
ask
for
something
else
my
aggressive
pour
produced
an
easy
three
fingers
of
rocky
bonewhite
head
with
really
impressive
retention
the
nose
had
a
sweet
lagerlike
aspect
to
it
which
was
right
for
the
style
the
color
was
a
bright
goldenyellow
with
nequality
clarity
i
have
to
agree
with
the
cans
verbiage
which
read
and
satin
smoothness
the
mouthfeel
was
very
smooth
gliding
across
my
tongue
like
the
back
of
my
hand
running
down
my
lovers
spine
just
enough
to
remind
me
that
it
was
there
but
not
enough
to
be
obtrusive
in
any
way
the
taste
was
a
bit
sweet
in
the
mouth
but
not
in
the
usual
lagersweet
way
it
was
more
subdued
with
an
idea
of
sweetness
but
then
again
not
sweet
definitely
not
hoppy
hopheads
look
elsewhere
the
finish
was
dry
but
it
also
left
a
lingering
perfumey
taste
after
the
swallow
i
did
not
totally
mind
it
but
i
really
wish
that
there
had
been
some
hops
to
offset
all
of
the
mild
sweetness
hey
for
the
price
the
jug
i
mean
huge
can
it
was
a
bargain
do
i
like
lagers
sure
but
is
just
a
kiss
of
the
hops
too
much
to
ask
for
i
remain
ambivalent
d
meh
its
ok
nothing
off
but
exceedingly
flavourless
drinkability
im
quite
sure
i
wouldve
been
happy
with
anything
else
on
the
menu
even
though
there
was
sapporo
and
a
few
others
of
the
same
ilk
and
a
few
domestics
do
folks
really
drink
this
style
and
enjoy
it
im
personally
going
to
be
avoiding
it
as
any
other
beer
wouldve
complimented
the
sushi
i
got
much
better
than
this
not
really
worth
a
try
not
too
terrible
at
all
i
thought
in
fact
it
was
fairly
decent
for
the
style
typical
light
gold
pour
with
light
head
and
smelled
of
corn
like
malt
mainly
taste
was
corn
like
malt
with
some
sweetness
but
not
too
much
and
no
real
off
flavors
average
body
and
carbonation
for
a
pale
lager
nothing
too
special
but
works
fine
at
a
sushi
bar
do
not
waste
your
time
the
beer
pours
a
pale
gold
color
with
a
12
white
head
that
quickly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
pretty
light
malt
scent
its
crisp
and
clean
with
little
character
the
taste
is
average
it
has
a
dry
pale
malt
and
adjunct
flavor
that
is
easily
quaffable
it
goes
down
quick
and
finishes
clean
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
low
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
an
easy
drinking
asian
lager
it
would
go
good
with
spicey
food
or
a
hot
summer
day
its
nothing
spectacular
but
it
drinks
well
drinkability
definitely
good
with
japanese
food
i
suggest
tempura
or
tonkatsu
which
are
both
fried
japanese
dish
another
from
the
subpar
beers
of
the
world
pack
i
dont
expect
these
types
of
beers
to
have
a
lot
of
flavor
and
aroma
but
i
do
expect
it
to
be
pleasing
this
failed
on
all
counts
smell
mouthfeel
no
just
no
body
is
thin
fizzy
and
watery
i
drank
about
3
sips
and
the
rest
went
down
the
drain
avoid
this
is
bland
and
nearly
flavorless
d
this
wouldnt
be
my
first
choice
in
a
japaneses
beer
its
not
the
worst
one
that
ive
had
but
theres
better
ones
than
this
d
super
drinkable
good
session
beer
goes
well
with
sushi
but
little
else
had
this
after
a
few
good
beers
and
it
was
like
having
a
glass
of
water
its
actually
cheaper
by
volume
in
bottle
than
in
the
can
here
in
china
so
maybe
this
is
a
slightly
better
value
after
all
oelergud
clear
average
amber
yellow
with
virtually
zero
head
rentention
and
definetly
zero
lacing
somewaht
sweet
smelling
somewhat
grainy
with
a
hint
of
metal
or
hemoglobinjk
fairly
innoculus
at
first
swig
then
theres
a
sharp
bite
and
its
all
down
hill
from
there
certainly
dry
ini
the
finish
but
i
cant
get
past
the
metallic
astringincy
mouthfeel
was
average
this
beer
took
the
finish
off
of
my
desk
when
i
spilled
a
small
amount
enough
said
asahi
is
not
an
enjoyable
lager
it
is
too
puckery
and
disagreeable
in
the
mouth
first
and
last
time
very
wimpy
aroma
of
cooked
veggies
and
a
lil
pop
of
the
euro
yeast
skunk
but
the
taste
was
not
bad

a
clean
and
crisp
lager
taste
with
a
steady
flow
of
malt
tad
high
import
priced
at
over
7
for
a
sixer
but
would
make
for
a
good
beer
for
a
tasting
of
import
lagers
d
probably
scored
higher
than
what
it
really
is
because
this
beer
is
supposed
to
be
well
bland
i
guess
its
probably
suited
to
delicate
japanesse
cuisine
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
if
you
wanted
to
not
filling
beer
a
fuzzy
two
finger
white
head
a
bit
soapy
but
it
settled
quickly
enough
clear
yellow
or
pale
gold
in
colour
with
moderate
carbonation
initially
it
smelled
more
of
the
aluminum
can
it
came
out
of
than
anything
else
it
tasted
dry
alright
wth
only
a
hint
of
anything
that
might
approach
a
hop
very
muted
in
that
regard
dry
again
in
the
mouth
with
a
bit
of
refreshment
value
aftertaste
however
was
a
wee
bit
salty
the
finish
sharp
and
abrupt
eventually
went
flat
not
what
id
like
to
be
drinking
all
night
but
okay
for
a
short
while
around
a
campfire
d
one
of
the
better
massproduced
beers
that
i
have
had
but
really
nothing
to
make
me
come
back
with
it
though
this
would
be
good
with
sushi
or
a
nice
japanese
dinner
at
matsu
on
talbert
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
with
no
dating
info
into
a
pint
glass
it
was
a
very
pale
straw
color
it
had
a
decent
white
head
that
quickly
faded
into
a
thin
foam
fed
by
average
carb
the
aroma
was
awful
skunked
with
no
other
redeming
qualities
to
it
the
taste
was
just
as
bad
mouthfeel
was
very
watery
just
not
a
good
beer
at
all
and
would
never
have
again
would
rather
have
a
bud
light
than
this
mess
1
5
na
ml
n
final
statment
what
did
i
expect
from
a
japanese
rice
lager
brewed
under
contract
by
molson
not
much
from
a
12oz
can
pours
a
very
clear
pale
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
this
beer
really
has
no
aroma
to
it
at
all
this
beer
really
doesnt
have
any
flavor
either
just
slightly
sweet
with
just
a
hint
of
bitterness
and
very
watery
i
think
i
will
pass
this
beer
up
in
the
future
overall
another
average
japanese
macrolager
asahi
super
dry
pours
a
golden
yellow
with
a
white
head
from
a
brown
twelve
ounce
bottle
a
little
bit
of
grainy
malt
sweetness
is
noticeable
in
the
aroma
the
flavor
is
also
mostly
malt
its
a
bit
grainy
maybe
the
slightest
bit
of
hops
too
corn
husk
like
flavor
in
the
aftertaste
not
too
bad
but
nothing
worth
going
out
of
the
way
for
drinkability
was
ok
id
take
this
over
american
lagers
which
are
unbalanced
and
too
rich
with
adjunct
flavors
at
least
this
goes
down
like
water
ive
had
worse
overall
the
taste
is
a
bit
odd
and
a
bit
bland
at
least
its
actually
imported
from
canada
had
this
with
dinner
last
night
at
the
hibachi
steakhouse
it
was
the
last
one
on
their
menu
i
had
not
tried
so
you
know
i
had
to
try
it
poured
a
pale
golden
yellow
very
clear
with
lots
of
visible
carbonation
coming
up
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
initial
head
was
a
big
white
fizzy
mess
that
dropped
back
down
to
earth
or
nothing
and
essentially
left
a
pale
yellow
fizzy
liquid
in
front
of
me
no
lace
to
speak
of
whatsoever
smell
was
very
light
grain
or
rice
it
did
have
a
noticeable
smell
though
which
was
an
improvement
over
my
first
beersee
last
review
the
feel
was
very
crisp
short
lived
with
a
clean
and
a
slightly
dry
finish
not
super
dry
or
whatever
that
should
mean
the
flavors
were
somewhat
muted
what
was
there
was
a
grainy
yeasty
rice
sort
of
taste
like
a
liquid
crispix
beer
served
ice
cold
this
is
not
that
bad
and
it
is
definatly
drinkable
if
it
is
ice
cold
i
have
had
worse
beers
and
i
have
had
alot
better
i
would
really
like
to
try
a
damn
fine
japanese
beer
it
seems
the
only
ones
i
ever
see
are
these
muted
macro
lagers
someone
bring
on
something
good
they
were
either
out
of
or
stopped
serving
our
usual
yakitori
companion
sapporo
reserve
so
i
gave
this
a
shot
next
to
kirin
it
was
much
better
couldnt
see
it
in
the
opaque
cup
but
as
it
poured
it
was
goldenwe
all
know
what
macrolagers
look
like
so
who
cares
foamy
white
head
very
little
detectable
aroma
but
no
skunk
taste
is
clean
crisp
and
yes
dry
mild
pleasing
bitterness
this
beer
refreshes
and
to
wash
down
grilled
chicken
parts
i
was
quite
happy
will
probably
order
this
for
our
regular
yakitori
outings
i
am
strating
to
crave
grilled
chicken
heart
and
gizzard
already
16oz
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
golden
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
that
leaves
a
decent
amount
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
some
faint
grain
and
just
a
touch
of
hops
the
taste
is
clean
and
crisp
with
some
graininess
up
front
with
a
dry
finish
that
is
mildly
hopped
overall
this
is
a
decent
brew
but
it
does
not
possess
anything
that
makes
me
want
to
try
another
typical
japanese
rice
beer
pours
a
decent
yellowgold
with
a
nice
white
head
smells
of
malt
and
little
else
tastes
dry
very
little
malt
not
much
hops
either
but
balanced
feels
thin
on
the
tongue
very
carbonated
very
light
and
refeshing
however
with
several
pieces
of
fresh
sushi
i
have
had
lots
of
these
thaks
to
joe
at
susi
sapporo
looks
like
your
average
macro
lager
clear
gold
color
small
head
with
average
retention
very
little
smell
very
little
flavor
dry
finish
however
very
good
while
waiting
for
good
sushi
after
a
12
hour
work
day
avoid
if
at
all
possible
d
a
very
easy
to
drink
beer
due
to
its
light
almost
waterlike
flavor
its
smooth
and
goes
down
very
easy
i
guess
it
goes
well
with
sushi
thats
the
only
time
i
ever
get
it
md
very
crisp
not
as
dry
as
i
expected
it
would
be
it
is
relatively
refreshing
not
much
carbonation
a
decent
beer
but
not
great
this
is
a
delicious
change
of
pace
a
nice
crisp
taste
with
little
or
no
aftertaste
this
beer
offers
little
carbonation
without
any
bloating
slightly
higher
price
than
your
average
beer
but
your
tastebuds
and
stomach
will
thank
you
for
it
in
my
opinion
give
it
at
least
a
try
this
beer
poured
a
straw
like
yellow
but
wasnt
too
bright
with
a
foamy
head
that
left
quickly
and
left
athin
film
with
lacing
as
i
drank
it
the
beer
as
tated
in
the
name
haws
a
ver
dry
mouthfeel
that
is
actually
quite
plesaent
and
refreshing
th
smell
is
has
some
hints
of
malt
but
obviously
rice
overwhelms
the
smella
as
well
as
most
of
the
taste
it
has
minimal
bittrness
overall
a
good
asian
beer
imho
i
drink
it
everytime
i
go
to
any
japanese
restaurant
clear
pale
yellow
white
head
settles
fairly
quickly
slightly
fruity
grainy
smell
rice
taste
is
present
the
faintest
hop
flavor
as
well
very
watery
mouthfeel
very
easy
to
drink
but
not
much
taste
to
speak
of
could
easily
drink
this
over
a
long
evening
it
went
well
with
the
sushi
i
had
for
lunch
today
this
is
the
first
time
ive
had
the
asahi
it
poured
a
pale
yellow
with
a
white
head
that
faded
and
had
little
lacing
smelled
of
rice
and
a
faint
yeasty
quality
tasted
of
light
hops
and
grainy
but
mild
and
was
pretty
refreshing
it
was
very
dry
and
didnt
leave
an
aftertaste
but
it
was
quite
pleasant
and
complimented
my
sushi
dinner
i
usually
drink
sapporo
at
japanese
restaurants
but
i
think
ive
found
its
replacement
wherever
the
asahi
line
is
served
this
was
much
better
than
sapporo
in
my
opinion
22
oz
bottle
color
of
pale
yellow
with
a
short
off
white
head
nose
of
mild
hopps
some
cereal
oats
and
not
much
else

taste
of
mild
hops
malt
and
acidic
quality
body
watery
crisp
and
dry

aftertaste
of
almost
nonexistent
except
minimal
hopps
d
this
isnt
bad
it
is
the
first
ive
ever
had
of
the
stye
it
is
still
fairly
similiar
to
most
import
lagers
on
the
macro
spectrum
id
put
this
in
between
bud
light
and
heineken
but
thats
not
so
hot
if
i
lived
in
japan
and
needed
a
lawnmower
beer
i
might
go
for
this
maybe
pours
pale
wheat
colors
with
a
thick
foamy
head
a
little
bit
of
lacing
looks
like
a
light
pilsner
smell
is
very
light
grains
malts
taste
is
also
light
almost
like
seltzer
it
isnt
bad
per
se
just
nothing
stands
out
either
di
dont
think
i
will
be
having
this
again
all
i
can
say
is
at
least
it
didnt
ruin
my
enjoyment
of
my
sushi
sort
of
went
well
with
my
shiokara
obviously
catering
to
a
market
that
dont
really
want
a
beer
thats
going
to
challenge
the
tastebuds
which
is
fine
theres
certainly
nothing
unpleasant
about
it
i
can
also
imagine
it
being
a
good
accompaniment
to
japanese
food
the
clean
crisp
taste
complementing
a
cuisine
focused
on
fresh
ingredients
and
letting
the
delicate
flavours
of
the
food
have
the
limelight
however
for
me
there
are
plenty
of
other
mass
produced
lagers
that
offer
more
than
this
in
both
the
uk
and
australia
asahi
is
marketed
as
a
premium
lager
with
a
corresponding
price
tag
but
all
you
are
getting
for
this
is
the
packaging
i
had
a
sip
of
my
wifes
nastro
azzuro
and
this
was
in
a
different
league
by
comparison
pale
yellow
color
with
a
fizzy
head
that
rises
and
falls
quickly
smells
grainy
adjuncty
theres
some
kind
of
fake
sweetness
in
there
it
has
a
cereal
type
grainy
flavor
a
bit
of
a
sharp
acidity
at
the
top
with
basically
no
body
a
main
flavor
i
get
is
paint
which
is
not
good
finish
is
dry
but
only
because
there
was
basically
nothing
to
it
really
lacking
in
all
aspects
d
very
drinkable
with
the
right
food
sushi
overall
very
drinkable
nothing
too
exciting
but
nothing
offensive
went
quite
well
with
the
japanese
food
i
was
eating
certainly
good
enough
that
i
had
another
big
bottle
this
was
my
first
and
last
super
dry
asahi
unless
i
am
stranded
on
a
polynesian
island
and
this
is
all
that
is
available
drinkability
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
because
it
tastes
like
h2o
d
probably
one
of
the
best
sushi
beers
unobtrusive
and
complimentary
to
sushi
surprisingly
hoppy
smell
straight
away
little
nutty
and
wheaty
afterwards
pleasant
light
amber
color
very
clean
taste
but
you
can
still
taste
that
bit
of
riciness
at
the
end
along
with
a
mild
carbonated
bite
overall
a
clean
and
very
very
drinkable
beer
draft
of
choice
hands
down
in
any
restaurant
izakaya
snack
bar
etc
in
japan
asahi
super
dry
is
very
direct
and
simple
with
the
smallest
amount
of
malt
and
hops
necessary
to
make
it
legally
permissible
to
call
it
beer
the
flavor
is
adjunct
laden
with
light
grain
as
the
primary
taste
and
almost
no
hop
taste
at
all
there
is
the
slightest
taste
of
grassy
hops
but
they
are
flushed
away
quickly
as
you
drink
leaving
behind
the
taste
of
light
sweet
malt
it
is
easy
drinking
that
is
for
certain
but
it
is
no
better
than
other
macro
brewed
beers
and
it
should
be
avoided
if
possible
probably
wash
the
wasabe
down
quite
well
but
i
wouldnt
drink
it
on
a
daily
basis
served
in
a
pilsner
glass
the
beer
pours
a
light
golden
yellow
color
with
a
small
white
head
it
has
a
faint
smell
of
grain
and
rice
there
isnt
much
of
an
aroma
at
all
the
taste
is
pretty
much
the
same
like
grain
and
rice
not
a
strong
flavor
but
its
not
offensive
either
the
mouthfeel
is
light
has
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
and
its
crisp
and
refreshing
when
drank
cold
but
its
mostly
like
any
regular
macro
lager
its
not
something
id
drink
all
the
time
but
i
could
drink
a
couple
now
and
then
d
should
appeal
to
most
macro
drinkers
but
i
didnt
have
any
trouble
consuming
it
either
not
much
here
this
went
well
with
the
spicy
noodle
soup
i
was
eating
at
the
time
but
at
that
point
anything
wet
and
cold
would
have
worked
without
the
label
i
would
just
assume
this
was
another
bmc
macro
product
this
had
the
same
lack
of
aroma
taste
and
finish
light
golden
color
with
a
white
head
that
lingers
for
a
moment
not
much
in
the
nose
no
flavor
somewhat
fizzy
drinks
super
clean
no
after
taste
whatsoever
ok
this
is
the
lamest
review
i
have
ever
done
but
this
was
just
about
the
lamest
beer
ive
ever
had
drinkability
its
not
bad
icecold
and
straight
out
of
the
can
but
even
then
its
not
exactly
a
joy
to
drink
not
recommended
i
dont
recomend
this
one
save
a
buck
or
two
and
just
order
from
the
domestic
selection
i
wish
i
would
have
ordered
a
glass
of
the
excellent
plum
wine
my
girlfriend
had
or
some
saki
d
not
a
beer
to
complement
food
but
to
get
out
of
the
way
of
it
didnt
clash
with
any
of
the
multitude
of
flavors
from
the
japanese
food
good
and
bad
as
i
like
beer
to
accentuate
my
foods
not
hide
from
them
if
you
just
need
a
beer
to
go
with
whatever
this
will
do
the
job
nicely
would
not
drink
this
normally
unless
at
a
japanese
place
when
in
rome
i
had
this
beer
prior
to
dinner
at
a
japanese
steakhouse
poured
from
a
bottle
its
a
light
yellow
color
with
a
small
shortlived
head
the
beer
smells
faintly
of
grain
with
a
brief
note
of
hops
as
promised
on
the
label
the
beer
is
very
dry
with
almost
no
sweetness
in
the
taste
at
all
unfortunately
that
also
eliminates
a
lot
of
the
flavors
that
make
a
beer
tasty
theres
a
little
bitterness
in
the
abrupt
finish
light
mouthfeel
nothing
about
this
beer
is
particularly
bad
its
just
very
empty
so
theres
also
little
to
praise
this
beer
is
similar
to
your
macro
especially
with
the
obvious
adjunct
however
it
did
seem
to
lend
a
little
more
flavor
which
could
be
improved
a
little
with
some
hints
of
hops
maybe
ill
try
it
again
with
sushi
not
a
bad
brew
when
you
consider
the
style
smells
sweet
lagerish
tastes
sweet
as
well
with
some
hops
but
not
a
hell
of
a
lot
says
super
dry
on
the
label
im
not
sure
what
that
means
though
mouthfeel
is
pretty
good
nice
bubble
slightly
sticky
thick
sweetness
you
dont
expect
from
a
lager
of
this
kind
this
beer
lacks
some
complexity
but
redeems
itself
in
being
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
drinks
okay
certainally
a
cut
above
bmc
but
nothing
to
get
excited
about
look
for
a
sapporro
review
soon
since
thats
the
last
beer
they
have
there
beside
american
whizz
beers
12
ounce
brown
bottle
with
no
freshenss
date
to
be
found
pours
a
clear
gold
straw
color
with
a
nice
fluffy
head
some
lacing
clings
to
the
glass
not
much
in
the
aroma
department
other
than
a
little
grainy
malt
and
faint
hops
the
flavor
was
of
light
malt
with
dry
crisp
finish
highly
drinkable
just
not
much
going
on
in
the
flavor
department
maybe
my
taste
buds
are
off
but
this
wasnt
sooo
bad
theres
some
color
in
the
body
the
head
shrinks
but
never
goes
away
theres
no
dms
and
very
little
offensive
corn
flavor
its
still
a
virtually
tasteless
macro
lager
but
its
not
nearly
as
hateable
as
many
of
the
others
it
seems
like
the
guys
at
asahi
have
gone
to
far
in
their
effort
to
make
a
clean
dry
beer
avoid
d
easily
drank
but
not
good
at
all
i
was
very
disappointed
seeing
i
ordered
this
beer
for
my
birthday
lunch
went
out
for
sushi
and
was
severely
let
down
definitely
drink
this
one
in
the
summer
with
sushi
as
far
as
i
remember
the
japanese
one
is
much
better
i
have
had
lots
of
asahi
in
the
can
but
this
is
my
first
time
with
this
one
in
the
bottle
of
course
this
isnt
spectacular
compared
to
the
likes
dfh
or
3fs
but
then
again
it
isnt
that
kind
of
product
and
it
isnt
marketed
toward
that
kind
of
consumer
for
what
this
product
is
i
really
enjoy
it
it
poured
a
crystal
clear
golden
straw
colour
with
a
15mm
snow
white
head
that
lasted
for
approximately
90
seconds
i
was
actually
impressed
with
how
long
it
hung
around
quite
honestly
even
when
it
faded
it
did
not
go
away
completely
it
simply
subsided
to
about
a
5mm
blanket
across
the
top
thick
sticky
lacing
clings
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
has
almost
a
green
apple
smell
to
it
you
can
certainly
smell
the
rice
and
the
ricealcohol
in
this
doesnt
smell
terrible
by
any
stretch
taste
is
slightly
yeasty
with
some
definite
rice
sugar
sweetness
present
i
typically
do
not
go
for
the
japanese
rice
lager
style
but
if
i
had
to
pick
one
it
would
certainly
be
this
over
kirin
i
also
like
the
dryness
of
the
finish
on
this
one
it
is
what
it
is
i
suppose
overall
imported
from

canada
but
perhaps
it
is
the
oriental
part
of
canada
whereever
it
is
brewed
it
is
nothing
to
write
home
about
unless
the
grass
needs
cutting
it
is
fairly
clean
except
for
the
very
faint
and
not
really
all
that
objectionable
metallic
aroma
overall
not
a
bad
beer
wish
it
had
more
of
a
nose
and
better
head
retention
some
carbonation
on
the
tongue
is
the
only
mouthfeel
worth
noting
about
as
drinkable
as
a
typical
american
beer
does
work
well
cleansing
the
palate
between
the
tuna
roll
and
the
salmon
nigri
at
the
sushi
bar
taste
is
quite
weak
extremely
thin
in
body
very
watery
and
uncomplex
if
i
didnt
know
better
id
say
this
was
a
lite
theres
mostly
just
a
slight
sweetness
and
a
hop
presence
that
is
so
far
in
the
background
its
tough
to
find
this
is
drinkable
but
only
in
an
extremely
cold
glass
so
you
cant
taste
it
not
that
theres
much
to
taste
in
any
case
very
fizzy
but
refreshing
and
actually
kind
of
fun
very
nice
on
a
humid
boat
day
drinkability
this
is
a
decent
enough
offering
that
i
would
have
again
when
having
more
traditional
japanese
food
best
of
the
japanese
brews
i
have
had
light
watery
mouth
just
enough
carbonation
to
give
it
something
more
than
water
i
dont
regret
buying
this
beer
as
it
has
no
off
or
even
bad
flavors
but
i
wont
buy
it
again
too
boring
pours
a
clear
yellow
medium
sized
fluffy
white
head
forms
some
spotty
lace
no
retention
smell
is
really
sweet
ricy
some
caramel
and
a
little
citrus
taste
is
almost
nonexistant
little
bit
of
malt
some
rice
bread
citrus
thats
it
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
medium
carbonation
and
a
dry
finish
this
is
one
of
my
sushi
beers
it
pours
a
pale
yellow

slightly
golden
color
with
a
head
that
lasts
for
a
while
and
had
a
little
lacing
the
smell
is
of
grain
and
a
little
bit
of
light
hops
the
taste
is
nice
and
dry
a
little
bit
more
dry
than
the
standard
asahi
it
seems
it
has
a
very
clean
taste
of
grain
and
some
hops
but
very
light
on
both
it
goes
well
with
food
and
i
would
not
drink
it
without
the
food
the
astringent
aftertaste
lingers
a
bit
much
for
my
taste
not
my
particular
style
but
if
i
had
to
choose
between
several
of
the
american
light
lagers
and
this
i
would
choose
asahi
light
bodied
as
expected
i
could
and
did
drink
so
much
of
this
and
not
get
tired
of
the
flavor
asahi
in
america
simply
sucks
get
it
on
tap
in
japan
and
you
will
see
the
huge
difference
overall
we
can
confirm
the
rewiew
made
5
years
ago
the
beer
had
a
thin
mouth
with
decent
carbonation
while
it
was
able
to
standup
to
my
excellent
spicy
shanghai
noodles
it
would
not
be
a
beer
that
i
would
search
out
to
drink
on
its
own
a
middle
of
the
road
macro
brew
that
at
least
refreshes
im
surprised
this
beer
got
such
a
low
rating
i
guess
people
have
a
certain
standard
in
their
heads
and
anything
falling
outside
that
standard
will
be
rejected
irrespectlively
of
any
real
quality
unorthodox
as
it
may
be
this
pours
a
yellow
color
and
is
moderately
carbonated
it
has
a
somewhat
watery
mouthfeel
but
the
taste
is
great
it
really
is
super
dry
and
as
a
person
who
really
enjoys
a
dry
alcholic
beverage
whether
it
be
whiskey
or
beer
this
really
hits
the
spot
i
used
to
drink
this
stuff
when
i
was
a
kid
i
would
keep
my
stash
hidden
outside
my
house
in
the
bushes
during
the
winter
inevitably
it
would
freeze
and
let
me
tell
you
this
stuff
gets
even
better
when
its
been
concentrated
i
wont
have
any
problems
when
i
go
to
japan
because
this
stuff
is
alright
with
me
i
especially
like
the
32oz
silver
can
it
looks
hilarious
when
you
slowly
pull
it
out
of
you
front
pocket
it
looks
like
gods
beer
and
that
asahi
font
is
like
a
memory
trigger
the
body
is
light
but
with
some
generic
sweetness
on
the
back
end
a
nice
crispness
but
not
much
to
the
beer
overall
12
ounce
bottle
tastes
like
just
another
lager
its
got
a
fair
bitterness
to
it
but
not
enough
to
recommend
it
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
fizzy
finish
is
very
dry
and
ultimately
the
beer
is
quite
refreshing
for
a
simple
to
drink
beer
you
could
do
worse
but
its
quite
bland
really

some
white
head
up
on
top
that
actually
stays
for
a
while
and
a
clear
golden
beer
nose
shows
some
maltyness
litle
papery
a
hint
of
hops
and
the
ricecaracter
together
with
some
alcohol
taste
is
pale
watery
oxidised
and
ricefattoxidation
imo
nos
this
is
again
a
big
disappointement
and
mouthfeel
is
again
watery
empty
and
unplesant
runs
down
like
water
but
for
me
no
pleasure
drinking
this
the
beer
is
easy
to
drink
but
i
probably
wouldnt
buy
another
just
because
theres
nothing
that
really
makes
me
want
another
one
of
these
beers
its
not
a
beer
that
you
drink
and
get
the
impression
of
damn
this
is
good
not
even
oh
this
is
good
what
i
got
was
well
its
better
than
a
macro
mouthfeel
is
as
expected
pretty
light
drinkability
well
this
isnt
quite
my
cup
of
tea
uh
beer
probably
ok
for
a
rice
lager
but
i
wouldnt
be
looking
for
this
again
has
a
massive
off
white
eggshell
coloured
head
even
with
a
careful
pour
regulation
pale
yellowgold
colour
for
the
beer
livelly
carbonation
smell
is
fresh
and
not
unpleasant
weak
hops
and
quite
grainy
taste
again
is
light
with
essense
of
grassy
hop
and
some
sweetness
from
the
malts
not
great
but
not
horrid
at
the
start
i
sort
of
liked
the
dry
mouthfeel
but
as
this
633ml
bottle
went
on
it
became
less
pleasurable
and
more
annoying
overall
not
a
beer
i
would
buy
again
but
its
far
from
disgusting
notes
this
was
brewed
in
canada
by
molson
super
dull
this
is
drinkable
beer
but
nothing
really
to
get
excited
about
one
way
or
another
if
in
japan
go
for
the
sapporo
draft
as
for
the
smell
it
was
fairly
mild
with
some
what
i
thought
was
a
hint
of
rice
the
taste
is
similar
very
dry
as
the
label
suggests
and
clean
but
without
a
whole
lot
in
the
way
of
flavor
the
carbonation
is
moderate
and
certainly
not
overpowering
overall
a
fairly
drinkable
beer
that
would
go
great
with
a
hotspicy
meal
but
not
one
that
id
sit
back
and
chill
with
on
a
quiet
evening
like
most
beers
probably
best
in
its
country
of
origin
but
im
certainly
not
making
a
trip
to
japan
for
this
one
overall
not
bad
but
not
amazing
either
asahi
is
very
dry
as
the
label
indicates
finishes
complete
a
decent
session
brew
at
best
drinkability
being
weak
and
flavorless
effectively
slightly
alcoholic
water
it
has
potential
for
drinking
it
indefinitely
and
with
virtually
any
food
that
is
complimented
by
water
although
i
have
no
idea
why
one
would
want
to
do
that
to
themselves
this
is
a
great
beer
to
match
with
eating
at
the
beach
on
a
hot
summer
day
and
it
goes
very
well
with
fish
of
all
kinds
and
cooking
styles
there
really
isnt
that
much
to
this
beer
if
you
breathe
in
through
your
nose
right
before
sipping
the
skunk
aroma
overwelms
the
flavour
and
it
tastes
like
nothing
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
its
just
a
really
nondescript
beer
that
seems
like
a
cheap
knock
off
of
a
european
lagerpilsner
poured
a
pale
amber
color
with
moderfate
white
head
that
quickly
feel
to
a
slight
ring
smell
is
lightly
of
malt
taste
is
a
bit
malty
with
a
nice
dryness
finish
is
a
tantalizing
dryness
that
is
the
best
part
on
the
beer
a
nice
easy
refreshing
drink
pours
a
very
light
color
with
a
great
tall
fluffy
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
while
and
laces
the
glass
has
a
light
smell
of
yeast
not
much
else
in
the
way
of
aroma
the
flavor
is
minimal
not
much
sweetness
not
much
bitterness
not
much
of
anything
really
almost
like
drinking
water
poured
into
a
glass
that
used
to
have
beer
in
it
not
a
whole
lot
of
carbonation
either
slightly
creamy
having
tasted
a
fair
amount
of
japanese
flavor
id
say
this
beer
seems
to
fit
right
in
very
very
little
flavor
allowing
you
to
pick
out
the
individual
wisps
of
flavor
all
in
all
its
very
drinkable
you
could
drink
it
all
day
just
like
water
i
dont
mind
it
wouldnt
turn
it
down
but
probably
wont
spend
the
money
on
it
again
i
prefer
my
beer
with
lots
of
flavor
poured
a
sickly
pale
straw
color
tiny
white
cap
that
vanishes
immediately
no
lace
no
aroma
no
real
taste
but
very
crisp
and
dry
acheived
with
agressive
infused
carbonation
and
bittering
oils
much
like
club
soda
with
lemon
at
least
this
is
one
mega
brewer
with
the
guts
to
fess
up
to
using
rice
as
a
main
ingedient
overalla
nice
change
of
pace
lager
from
the
norm
not
outstanding
in
any
respect
but
you
could
definitely
try
this
as
a
change
of
pace
beer
sometime
when
your
looking
for
something
different
if
your
expecting
anything
more
though
expect
to
be
dissapointed
drinkability
definetely
average
is
the
word
to
remember
here
not
bad
but
nothing
exceptionnal
too
the
taste
is
sweet
with
a
slight
lingering
hoppiness
the
beer
is
slightly
too
carbonated
i
know
i
am
kicking
this
beer
dont
know
why
but
i
guess
i
expected
more
it
aint
bad
and
sometimes
if
you
got
limited
choice
i
do
choose
it
i
guess
its
just
an
average
beer
golden
yellow
with
a
mustardy
glow
head
is
loose
bluishwhite
and
doesnt
last
long
aroma
is
thin
clean
cereal
malt
rice
chex
maybe
subdued
sweetness
and
minimal
hop
bite
the
malt
flavors
up
front
are
a
little
cardboardy
adjuncty
and
not
sweet
in
the
least
makes
sense
since
this
is
super
dry
hops
come
in
surprisingly
strong
and
are
pretty
tasty
hmmm
could
still
use
more
though
no
skunk
just
a
semibitter
herbal
lemon
blaze
finish
is
dry
with
lingering
cereal
malt
not
bad
might
go
well
with
very
subtley
flavored
dishes
and
sushi
good
thirst
quencher
too
had
this
at
a
party
last
night
as
the
only
option
pours
a
light
yellow
without
much
head
what
is
there
doesnt
retain
very
well
the
smell
has
malt
and
metal
in
it
and
the
taste
is
obviously
dry
with
rice
and
metal
flavors
overpowering
pretty
much
everything
else
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
fizzy
but
the
overall
drinkability
isnt
terrible
i
guess
honestly
id
prefer
a
coors
light
to
this
one
if
that
says
anything
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
watery
but
it
was
rather
drinkable
if
not
one
i
really
enjoyed
given
a
choice
between
this
and
bud
id
pick
this
but
id
much
rather
go
for
almost
any
micro
overall
its
an
underwhelming
experience
but
damned
if
i
cant
stop
drinking
these
her
smell
is
very
watery
a
shy
smell
of
cereal
her
taste
is
not
much
nothing
present
shy
very
shy
nothing
at
all
no
character
nothing
the
malt
takes
over
and
then
water
yep
i
prefers
japanese
cars
it
pours
a
clear
straw
color
with
a
big
tightly
packed
head
that
dissipates
quite
quickly
the
aroma
is
of
sweetish
malts
some
corn
husk
and
just
a
whisp
of
hops
the
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
tiny
bit
of
hops
and
a
lot
of
water
there
is
virtually
no
aftertaste
in
this
beer
which
makes
it
hard
to
really
enjoy
a
beer
without
an
aftertaste
is
like
a
car
without
wheels
it
just
doesnt
fly
that
being
said
theres
nothing
offensive
about
this
beer
and
its
worth
a
try
definitely
waayy
better
than
blue
or
canadian
but
it
is
entirely
drinkable
not
offensive
easy
to
swallow
and
slightly
pleasant
plus
it
is
a
best
seller
if
that
sort
of
thing
is
important
to
you
it
makes
a
perfect
companion
at
the
typical
japanese
drinking
party
where
beer
is
treated
the
same
as
hard
liquor
with
very
slightly
larger
glasses
i
always
have
this
beer
with
sushi
it
is
good
in
a
glass
pours
a
pale
golden
with
a
bubbly
white
head
smells
of
hops
and
bit
of
grain
taste
is
nice
and
dry
with
a
crisp
finish
nothing
special
but
certainly
drinkable
i
didnt
realize
this
was
a
japanese
style
makes
sense
beer
is
good
happy
cheap
beering
the
label
says
that
asahi
super
dry
has
excellent
richness
uh
no
truly
refreshing
drinkability
okay
ill
give
em
that
one
since
im
feeling
generous
and
has
satin
smoothness
not
a
chance
one
out
of
three
is
pretty
good
in
baseball
and
might
even
win
you
a
batting
crown
but
doesnt
cut
it
in
this
case
avoid
this
one
served
as
a
bottle
and
a
frosted
glass
clear
light
gold
with
brief
white
head
faint
sweet
scent
clean
malt
taste
develops
a
metal
tinge
as
it
warms
fine
sharp
prickly
carbonation
with
a
sweet
corn
aftertaste
whats
so
dry
about
it
its
still
a
hell
of
lot
better
than
singha
at
least
i
can
finish
the
bottle
without
getting
a
headache
id
have
it
again
if
theres
a
bowl
of
edamame
involved
a
below
average
brew
that
wont
offend
anyone
yellow
and
very
clear
fizzy
with
absolutely
no
head
retention
very
mild
aroma
with
some
bread
yeast
and
a
bit
of
hops
some
sweetness
at
the
front
switches
to
a
shortlived
sharp
hop
bitterness
the
finish
is
very
dry
but
is
certainly
not
due
to
hops
slightly
metallic
aftertaste
which
is
probably
contributing
to
dryness
light
and
fizzy
moderate
smoothness
except
at
the
finish
1
5
fizzy
bubbly
white
head
with
huge
bubbles
clear
rich
gold
beer
with
lots
of
carbonation
there
are
nuts
ink
and
sweet
shpunku
in
the
nose
a
tangy
citrusy
front
leads
to
a
thin
cheesy
body
the
finish
is
a
little
fishy
with
some
toasty
crackers
its
dry
and
citrusyfresh
not
bad
gets
fairly
nutty
at
the
end
this
is
quite
a
boring
beer
i
guess
it
could
be
considered
crisp
and
maybe
even
easy
to
drink
but
i
could
not
imagine
drinking
too
many
of
these
there
is
nothing
here
that
would
want
to
make
me
come
back
to
this
beer
i
guess
i
should
start
off
by
saying
that
i
wasnt
expecting
much
from
this
beer
and
i
got
even
less
than
that
this
beer
is
just
horrible
it
is
very
dry
and
i
cant
say
that
it
plays
to
its
advantage
this
is
falls
into
the
swill
macro
class
i
am
really
gonna
have
a
hard
time
finishing
this
one
i
think
i
am
gonna
need
a
sn
stout
chaser
overall
impression
some
good
points
but
it
all
falls
apart
in
the
taste
smells
fairly
inviting
had
a
nice
head
not
unpleasant
on
the
tongue
but
the
taste
just
didnt
do
it
for
me
have
to
admit
a
bias
toward
the
style
so
ill
have
to
adjust
my
scores
up
slightly
but
i
dont
think
i
can
finish
this
one
ill
use
it
as
sacrifice
to
our
troops
in
iraq
who
im
sure
wouldnt
turn
it
down
drinkability
i
had
no
problem
drinking
this
beer
every
day
for
a
week
in
japan
its
better
than
kirin
and
more
drinkable
the
beer
after
forsaking
the
33
8
ounce
can
pours
to
a
crystalline
gold
color
the
head
in
portly
in
size
and
is
a
bright
white
color
the
texture
is
semicreamy
with
the
residual
lace
a
thin
veil
to
obfuscate
the
glass
nose
is
all
malt
fresh
and
crisp
start
is
quite
sweet
and
fair
to
middling
on
the
malt
with
the
top
thin
finish
is
authoritarian
in
its
acidity
the
hops
apropos
to
the
style
quite
dry
and
makes
a
good
palate
cleanser
for
the
real
ales
to
come
overall
a
typical
japanese
beer
too
watery
too
sweet
goes
good
with
rice
and
noodles
but
otherwise
not
worth
drinking
at
all
not
real
drinkable
i
know
3
types
of
sapporo
that
are
better
kinda
plain
and
bland
seems
as
though
its
missing
something
good
but
nothin
special
if
youre
having
sushi
and
need
a
japanese
beverage
with
alcohol
but
cant
stomach
warm
sake
give
it
a
try
if
youre
in
the
supermarket
and
see
it
on
the
shelf
run
away
run
far
away
very
pale
clear
yellow
under
a
one
finger
head
that
lasts
surprisingly
long
and
even
manages
to
muster
some
body
before
fading
to
film
there
are
a
few
drops
of
lace
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
so
mild
as
to
be
nearly
nonexistent
with
just
a
hint
of
sweetness
the
mouth
is
well
carbonated
and
a
bit
heavy
sour
the
taste
is
mild
and
yes
dry
there
may
be
a
hint
of
the
rice
but
no
sign
of
the
corn
rather
the
opening
is
grainy
and
a
touch
lemon
sour
while
the
finish
is
less
hoppy
bitter
than
wet
paper
moldy
the
aftertaste
leaves
the
impression
of
wet
socks
i
actually
didnt
think
the
first
few
sips
were
that
bad
but
this
beer
has
grown
on
me
in
the
negative
sense
not
sure
ill
finish
it
the
czechs
should
be
ashamed
this
is
a
very
pale
straw
color
that
lacks
in
head
smells
of
almost
a
hay
and
grains
the
taste
is
very
dry
like
the
label
suggests
leaves
much
to
be
desired
there
is
really
something
lacking
in
this
beer
the
aftertaste
is
not
very
noticable
the
label
says
it
was
made
under
the
supervision
of
molson
but
how
could
they
let
somehthing
like
this
leave
the
brewery
i
want
a
big
fan
of
this
import
decent
a
dark
yellowgolden
colour
with
a
nice
white
head
of
foam
the
smell
is
like
that
of
regular
beer
a
bit
of
malt
a
bit
of
hops
and
not
much
else
going
on
the
taste
is
just
like
the
aroma
as
straight
forward
a
brew
as
ive
ever
drunk
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
but
decent
and
the
drinkability
is
ok
not
the
worst
really
decent
beer
that
goes
with
any
type
of
japanese
food
but
i
do
not
aspire
to
drink
merely
decent
beer
this
beer
poured
to
a
clear
gold
with
a
head
that
was
gone
quickly
there
was
very
little
aroma
the
taste
was
crisp
and
grainy
good
carbonation
not
much
hop
presence
and
kind
of
watery
the
super
dry
premise
not
that
dry
any
dryness
was
probably
more
noticeable
due
to
the
near
absence
of
any
other
ingredients
there
was
a
slight
sweetness
in
the
aroma
and
taste
as
it
warmed
up
i
had
to
try
one
but
i
dont
think
id
have
one
of
these
again
so
dry
and
carbonated
theres
not
much
flavor
to
this
one
i
wouldnt
recommend
it
to
anyone
at
a
japaenese
restaurant
i
heard
that
it
is
brewed
in
the
czech
republic
im
sure
this
beer
gets
dissed
alot
just
because
its
probably
so
accessible
outside
of
japan
but
i
have
to
admit
that
if
im
out
in
japan
this
is
probably
my
beer
of
choice
despite
my
otherwise
undying
loyalty
to
sapporo
this
beers
to
be
superdry
i
dont
know
about
all
of
that
but
it
tastes
excellent
very
very
very
cold
in
a
very
very
very
cold
mugwhich
japanese
bars
and
restaurants
seem
to
understand
i
think
the
talk
of
this
beer
matched
with
sushi
or
whatnot
is
a
bit
of
baloney
its
a
macrobrewed
pilsener
the
bud
of
japanbut
not
the
butt
of
japan
i
enjoy
drinking
this
beerwhich
is
important
just
as
there
are
moments
when
a
budweiser
tastes
excellent
there
are
those
same
moments
for
this
beer
give
it
a
try
extra
cold
my
personal
recommendation
match
with
suhi
was
better
in
japan
where
fresher
and
less
watery
or
corn
tasting
dry
have
to
follow
up
with
a
full
16
oz
water
not
for
everyone
slight
lemon
finish
and
liked
it
with
a
slice
of
lemon
good
for
its
style
but
not
much
going
on
for
you
beer
pros
ive
never
actually
had
this
with
japanese
food
so
perhaps
this
is
where
im
missing
the
point
i
wouldnt
drink
too
many
of
these
in
succession
on
their
own
ive
found
them
just
a
bit
too
full
on
and
overall
unbalancd
perhaps
with
some
sushimi
or
teppanyaki
i
might
find
a
more
suitable
place
for
it
worth
a
try
but
not
a
keeper
overall
i
didnt
think
too
much
of
this
beer
it
was
almost
too
dry
leaving
me
feeling
kinda
parched
instead
of
refreshed
the
medicinal
aspect
of
super
drys
flavor
profile
did
little
to
endear
it
to
me
ill
order
something
else
if
i
see
it
on
a
menu
anywhere
and
it
wont
find
its
way
into
my
fridge
again
accented
my
leftover
ribs
just
fine
a
highly
compromised
imitation
of
a
classic
style
doesnt
hold
a
candle
to
sapporo
draught
in
the
steel
can
imported
from
japan
try
not
having
a
beer
for
2
weeks
then
jumping
into
this
combination
youd
be
as
hyped
as
myself
this
beer

small
head
and
no
lacing
on

glass
the
aroma
is
pretty
boring
the
taste
is
slightly
better
than
sapporo
but
still
very
much
like
bud
light
it
is
very
uninteresting
because
it
is
a
mass
product
but
it
is
the
best
japanese
beer
i
am
familiar
with
this
beer
pours
a
clear
medium
light
golden
color
with
a
large
white
head
that
dissipates
to
small
and
slightly
clingy
the
smell
is
mildly
malty
and
grainy
the
taste
has
an
odd
sweetnessprobably
atributed
to
the
adjuncts
with
a
medicinal
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
not
surprisingly
on
the
thin
side
of
firm
overall
an
uninteresting
lager
that
considering
the
sweetness
makes
the
name
superdry

to
understand

quickly
little

lawn

aroma
light

and
associated
aromatics
and
weedy
huskiness
lots
of
carbonation
at
first
matching
a
lightly
sweet
graininess
but
later
reinforcing
some
very
astringent
hop
and
metallic
flavors
as
in
some
the
overcarbonation
makes
the
sharpness
linger
into
the
aftertaste
popping
up
the
back
of
the
nasal
cavity
the
finish
of
this
beer
is
its
downfall
unsettling
medicinal
and
gassy
the
good
notes
are
it
is
refreshing
at
first
when
cold
and
it
is
drinkable
with
japanese
food
that
is
the
only
time
i
ever
have
it
not
too
many
japanese
restaurants
with
micro
brews
on
tap
this
lager
poured
a
clear
golden
straw
color
with
thick
creamy
white
foam
not
much
smell
to
speak
of
but
a
bit
of

the
taste
was
mildly
malty
with
a

the
mouthfeel

a
500ml

of

says
it

czech

on
the
back
hey
it
cant
be
that
bad
and
it
isnt
but
it
isnt
anything
spectacular
either
a
fair
middleoftheroad
beer
its
usually
my
first
choice
when
out
for
sushi
and
i
suppose
the
meal
either
enhances
it
or
masks
its
flaws
pours
out
with
a
big
white
cloudy
head
that
lasts
a
while
and
leaves
a
bit
of
lace
in
its
wake
down
the
glass
colour
is
a
straw
gold
with
lots
and
lots
of
bubbles
the
nose
is
a
bit

and
the
taste

very
dry

flavour
nearly
comes
and
goes
before
you
can
pick
up
on
it
very
faint
taste
of
grains

light

mouthfeel
is
akin
to
almost
any
higher
end
marco
lager
an
okay
match
for
sushi

hot

barbecuing
but
it
needs
to
be
partnered
up
to
enjoy
drinkabilitynotes
i
found
the
aftertaste
of
this
beer
to
be
quite
unpleasant
it
was
not
the
bitterness
that
i
objected
to
but
rather
the
harsh
and
lingering
medicinal
quality
i
will
not
be
drinking
this
again
unless
it
is
free
well
well
this
beer
from
japan
was
contractually
made
in
canada
wont
make
much
of
a
difference
this
will
be
the
last
one
of
these
ill
have
it
reminds
me
of
a
few
of
the
macro
lights
that
many
of
us
love
to
joke
about
only
difference
is
that
this
one
probably
isnt
dirt
cheap
got
it
in
my
international
sampler
so
i
dont
know
the
individual
price
stick
with
your
natty
light
if
youre
into
this
flavor
pale
golden
color
sudsy
head
that
dissipated
to
a
thin
white
ring
and
left
a
very
tiny
amount
of
lace
as
it
went
down
smell
is
not
strong
mostly
grainy
taste
is
weak
grain
with
a
very
low
hop
flavor
and
low
bitterness
finishes
very
clean
with
little
aftertaste
feels
watery
yes
it
is
dry
in
that
it
is
not
a
sweet
beer
but
it
does
not
parch
you
like
sapporo
the
sample
i
tasted
was
brewed
under
contract
by
molson
in
toronto
pours
out
very
clear
and
straw
yellow
i
like
that
the
label
claims
this
super
dry
is
the
beer
for
all
seasons
heads
up
with
a
clear
white
foam
that
doesnt
last
more
than
a
minute
a
nice
mix
of
sweet
malt
and
herbal
hop
in
the
nose
not
a
lot
of
flavor
in
this
somewhat
smooth
brew
though
it
fills
the
mouth
with
crispness
and
refreshes
finishes
with
an
understated
blend
of
hop
and
grain
its
brewed
by
molson
and
sure
tastes
like
it
pours
a
pale
golden
straw
color
with
a
thin
white
head
that
immediately
fades
into
a
trace
amount
of
bubbly
lace
nose
is
grain
husks
and
is
a
bit
metallic
very
light
in
body
with
an
initially
sweet
taste
that
soon
turns
to
a
flavor
of
stale
grains
and
rice
maybe
a
bit
of
cardboard
as
well
mild
amount
of
hops
in
the
very
dry
finish
not
a
beer
ill
be
buying
more
of
as
light
beer
goes
and
this
is
probably
the
lightest
beer
that
i
would
ever
intentionally
drink
it
wasnt
too
bad
clear
straw
color
with
crisp
malty
taste
was
really
all
i
expected
from
this
beer
so
i
guess
i
wasnt
dissapointed
i
was
drinking
this
with
chinese
food
and
went
well
certainly
not
heavy
but
able
to
compliment
spicey
food
had
a
few
on
a
recent
overseas
flight
surprised
by
its
nice
balance
of
flavors
pale
straw
color
medium
light
body
mild
bitterness
mild
malt
mild
hops
dry
reminscent
of
fruits
pleasantly
clean
with
a
refreshing
carbonated
note
and
a
lingering
bitterness
overall
a
nice
effort
from
japan
as
for
the
beer
itself
its
clean
and
refreshing
and
works
well
with
food
on
its
own
it
isnt
overly
enjoyable
but
its
blend
of
hops
and
malts
with
an
emphasis
on
the
hoppier
side
of
things
makes
it
a
great
accompaniment
to
some
good
food
clear
shiny
golden
color
fizzy
white
head
head
left
in
seconds
moderate
glass
shaking
kept
it
alive
wierd
mixed
smell
of
stale
corn
water
iron
ore
and
sour
mash
taste
was
oddly
corn
like
some
sour
old
beer
tastes
as
well
faint
fizzy
hop
presence
not
much
though
thin
watery
finish
taste
reminded
me
of
burnt
scrambled
eggs
when
i
finished
i
tried
to
stay
positive
on
this
one
but
couldnt
get
much
out
of
it
ill
have
a
sapporo
next
time
or
ice
water
although
the
food
was
great
this
is
nice
i
could
consume
a
number
of
these
critters
in
any
given
session
appearance
is
its
weak
point
really
nice
colour
with
limited
head
aroma
is
crisp
and
clean
taste
is
of
a
well
balanced
brew
with
an
ever
slight
lean
towards
the
hops
body
is
medium
light
which
leads
to
a
higher
drinkability
clear
golden
in
color
topped
by
a
good
sized
bright
white
head
that
holds
well
the
head
drops
to
a
good
collar
and
light
surface
coating
but
leaves
no
lace
the
aroma
is
of
a
sweet
grainy
malt
with
minimal
background
hops
the
body
is
light
with
a
fine
median
carbonation
thats
crisp
in
the
mouth
but
also
smooth
the
flavor
starts
sweet
but
soon
reveals
interwoven
notes
of
hop
flavor
and
a
balancing
bitterness
as
you
progress
through
the
glass
the
bitterness
builds
on
the
palate
the
finish
is
dry
with
a
light
spot
of
bitterness
that
lays
at
the
back
of
the
throat
very
clean
well
brewed
a
nice
mainstream
beer
that
actually
has
a
touch
of
bitterness
to
it
not
much
going
on
here
completely
mild
and
unremarkable
thick
head
that
disappeared
fast
typical
lager
coloring
really
lacking
in
the
taste
department
though
i
am
still
waiting
for
that
first
really
good
japanese
beer
interesting
to
note
japanese
beer
but
brewed
for
our
consumption
by
the
czechs
asahi
is
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
but
nothing
significant
the
pale
golden
colour
and
magically
disappearing
head
are
unimpressive
the
smell
is
weak
and
the
taste
is
fairly
indistinguishable
the
body
is
fairly
light
with
a
slight
bite
on
the
toungue
although
this
brew
is
not
super
it
is
pleasantly
dry
and
drinks
pretty
nice
although
i
would
not
compromise
my
sushi
with
it
a
good
choice
to
drink
when
thirsty
by
itself
and
probably
better
with
food
i
would
not
turn
my
nose
up
at
it
went
out
for
chinese
food
the
take
out
kind
sweet
and
sour
pork
with
steamed
rice
and
picked
up
a
21
4oz
bottle
of
asahi
with
a
twist
off
cap
asahi
super
dry
poured
a
light
golden
straw
with
a
nice
head
that
cleared
to
a
wispy
ring
soon
after
taste
is
hops
bitter
up
front
with
the
malt
not
far
behind
then
comes
the
dry
and
pleasantly
bitter
after
taste
that
will
linger
on
for
a
bit
there
is
also
some
slightly
detectable
yet
undefinable
carbohydrate
sweetness
the
carbonation
charge
was
still
ample
even
with
the
twist
off
cap
asahi
super
dry
is
a
nice
table
beer
that
goes
well
with
chinese
food
asahi
super
dry
really
has
little
flavor
mouthfeel
or
aroma
its
very
watery
and
as
the
name
implies
crisp
and
dry
pours
a
shiny
clear
yellowgolden
or
maybe
straw
color
head
dies
very
young
there
are
slight
peppery
saaz
hop
notes
on
the
nose
as
well
as
on
the
palate
nothing
great
in
this
brew
it
is
truly
refreshing
and
crisp
though
the
finish
is
dry
of
course
overall
drinkable
refreshing
but
as
the
name
states
its
super
dry
drinkable
but
pretty
bland
imo
it
is
lacking
in
the
taste
department
clear
dark
straw
hue
the
head
dissipates
quickly
mild
saaz
hop
nose
a
bit
of
light
graininess
in
aroma
light
in
body
as
expected
decent
balance
of
light
hop
bitterness
and
malt
sweetness
but
unfortunately
slightly
offputting
cooked
veggie
flavors
come
through
in
the
finish
super
dry
is
a
bland
lager
with
only
a
bit
more
overall
character
than
an
american
macrobrew
there
are
better
thirst
quenchers
out
there
one
of
those
drinkable
but
not
interesting
beers
a
bit
expensive
for
what
you
get
not
much
taste
dryish
and
a
bit
grainy
only
drink
it
if
the
weathers
hot
very
light
but
somehow
looks
like
stained
glass
no
head
perhaps
a
poor
pour
it
was
very
dry
and
veyr
pleasant
to
drink
relatively
plain
taste
goes
well
with
just
about
any
food
as
such
it
had
an
odd
tongue
on
battery
type
of
light
taste
at
first
which
wasnt
too
bad
a
very
drinkable
beer
its
good
with
a
meal
when
you
dont
really
want
to
pay
attention
to
the
beer
in
my
opinion
thats
all
most
lighter
colored
beers
are
good
for
for
the
style
it
aint
bad
but
it
also
aint
worth
the
price
had
one
of
the
big
bottles
21
ozs
states
that
it
is
brewed
in
canada
by
molson
bit
darker
than
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
with
a
strawish
golden
colour
the
head
lacked
big
time
husky
almost
metallike
aroma
little
hay
in
there
also
thought
it
would
be
bone
dry
but
there
was
a
touch
of
residuals
in
the
front
crisp
finish
was
very
dry
lots
of
husky
malt
with
metallic
undertones
from
an
astringent
flavour
hops
were
quick
and
snappish
with
a
sharp
bitterness
that
went
hand
and
hand
with
the
husk
flavour
not
a
beer
that
ill
go
back
to
poured
from
an
11
2
oz
can
has
a
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
virtually
odorless
not
much
of
anything
taste
is
mild
some
malts
bland
finishes
dry
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
overall
this
beer
is
very
weak
and
not
worth
seeking
out
i
agree
with
the
previous
review
so
i
wont
go
into
detail
just
wanted
to
add
that
i
have
tried
7
or
8
of
asahis
various
flavors
and
they
are
indeed
pretty
much
the
same
for
some
reason
i
keep
buying
the
special
editions
or
ones
that
i
dont
see
as
often
as
was
the
case
with
the
orion
but
they
always
let
me
down
compared
to
most
other
average
japanese
beers
asahi
is
definitely
done
well
but
for
a
girl
who
grew
up
on
micros
from
the
pacific
nw
and
watched
ninkasi
get
started
they
all
lack
complexity
o
uninteresting
not
special
i
havent
tried
very
many
of
asahis
40
or
so
varieties
but
part
of
me
wonders
if
the
rest
are
similar
