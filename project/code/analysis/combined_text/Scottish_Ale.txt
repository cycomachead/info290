great
beer
smooth
taste
would
recommend
maybe
i
got
a
bad
batch
but
i
recall
enjoying
this
beer
more
last
year
i
remember
a
more
distinctive
and
pleasant
molasses
smell
and
taste
as
a
wee
heavy
its
not
bad
but
i
prefer
dirty
bastard
overall
more
of
a
wee
heavyscotch
ale
it
lacks
a
lot
of
roasted
flavor
which
a
porter
should
have
in
my
mind
but
it
does
have
a
nice
blend
of
sweetersugary
flavors
with
a
nice
maltiness
good
porter
with
the
same
style
and
gunn
innis
that
i
love
inniss
gunn
take
all
the
characteristics
of
a
solid
porter
and
make
it
fun
with
notes
of
peat
oak
and
molasses
nothing
mind
blowing
just
a
fun
beer
showcasing
the
barrel
aging
that
the
brewery
is
well
known
for
overall
the
flavor
did
have
a
lot
going
on
but
the
heat
of
the
alcohol
kind
of
ruined
it
it
also
didnt
seem
very
wellbalanced
as
the
malt
flavor
kind
of
took
over
i
enjoy
scottish
ales
a
lot
but
this
one
was
a
bit
over
the
top
it
seems
to
be
on
the
verge
of
being
a
great
beer
but
is
not
quite
there
yet
i
dont
think
i
would
recommend
this
one
i
would
buy
again
if
in
mood
for
a
porter
overall
another
solid
offering
from
innis
gunn

grade

a
b
igs
scottish
whisky
porter
is
a
serviceable
strong
ale
but
its
not
very
porterlike
at
all
if
handed
this
blindfolded
id
probably
call
it
a
wee
heavy
making
the
ba
classification
pretty
accurate
in
my
view
a
little
too
sweet
to
be
something
id
drink
regularly
but
still
a
brew
that
i
could
see
myself
picking
up
sporadically
which
is
roughly
how
i
feel
about
their
flagship
oaked
ale
fans
of
that
beer
and
other
ig
products
should
find
this
to
be
a
worthwhile
diversion
but
if
youre
not
already
a
member
of
that
group
then
i
cant
see
this
beer
changing
your
opinion
of
the
brewery
very
much
good
smooth
beer
strong
nice
finish
overall
as
others
have
noticed
this
does
not
really
seem
to
be
a
porter
its
closer
to
scotch
ale
that
said
its
intriguing
and
pretty
tasty
with
a
nice
oakvanilla
note
dovetailing
into
the
sweet
molasses

115
not
great
but
at
least
some
of
the
old
ig
bugaboos
are
being
phased
out
nice
heavy
mouthfeel
with
undertones
of
both
molasses
and
toffee
love
the
beer
reminiscent
of
sweet
potato
soufflet
on
a
cold
winter
night
o
densely
flavor
packed
and
complex
but
marred
by
the
offfermented
taste
also
like
a
cola
which
i
rarely
drink
so
sweet
i
had
to
eat
too
many
pretzels
to
counter
it
to
finish
sigh
while
i
could
rail
on
about
the
lack
of
any
sort
of
porter
characteristics
in
this
offering
that
would
be
putting
the
cart
before
the
horse
this
may
look
the
part
but
in
the
end
it
comes
off
as
nothing
more
than
a
typical
wood
aged
strong
ale
this
time
with
perhaps
a
bit
more
roasted
blather
yeah
you
know
how
i
feel
disappointing
was
expecting
more
its
just
scotch
ale
and
a
bad
one
at
that
well
picked
this
up
the
other
night
and
was
expecting
a
porter
more
towards
a
scoth
ale
pours
a
deep
red
with
not
much
of
head
tasted
like
a
porter
gone
wrong
but
good
if
you
are
into
the
scotch
ales
over
all
it
was
ok
but
wont
be
going
at
this
again
where
better
to
bring
a
new
ig
beer
than
to
vdubbs
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
rubystudded
sienna
topped
by
a
halffinger
or
so
of
wan
tan
foam
the
nose
comprises
dried
maple
syrup
oak
vanilla
bean
light
cocoa
powder
very
light
roasted
malts
light
vague
stonefruit
and
a
hint
of
booze
wafting
in
the
breeze
the
taste
is
a
blast
of
oak
followed
by
a
cigar
wrapped
in
dank
greens
and
dipped
in
sweet
caramel
and
maple
syrup
unlike
most
other
ig
offerings
this
one
falls
apart
on
the
tongue
coming
across
muddled
confused
and
leaving
us
in
a
similar
place
the
body
is
a
lithe
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
smooth
feel
overall
a
definite
disappointment
here
its
not
a
complete
train
wreck
but
its
not
very
good
either
cheers
o
not
too
different
from
their
other
beers
flavorful
dry
easy
drinking
maybe
a
bit
drier
the
roasted
elements
though
subtle
do
make
this
stand
out
among
the
rest
of
the
4
ive
now
had
they
seem
to
shine
most
at
the
extremes
of
color
the
lightest
original
and
darkest
bourbon
stout
have
been
the
best
and
relatively
most
distinctive
lets
see
if
that
trend
continues
the
more
i
try
i
did
not
enjoy
this
beer
overall
not
really
a
porter
but
more
of
a
wee
heavyscotch
ale
it
lacks
a
lot
of
roasted
flavor
which
a
porter
should
have
in
my
mind
but
it
does
have
a
nice
blend
of
sweetersugary
flavors
with
a
nice
maltiness
if
looking
for
a
scotch
style
ale
then
this
is
a
good
choice
but
if
looking
for
a
robust
dark
porter
then
steer
away
a
nice
brew
but
just
not
a
nice
classification
picked
up
a
mixed
six
of
innis
and
gunn
beers
that
included
this
one
weak
appearance
thin
with
very
little
head
smell
however
was
very
interesting
and
had
me
wondering
about
flavor
downer
not
good
at
all
my
scottish
heritage
had
me
very
disappointed
in
this
beer
will
not
have
again
gonna
grab
the
skull
splitter
i
have
in
the
fridge
next
to
feel
better
about
the
homeland
o
i
really
like
this
porter
but
because
of
the
molasses
and
7
4
alcohol
it
wouldnt
be
a
regular
for
me
i
think
it
would
food
pair
nicely
with
baby
back
ribs
smothered
in
a
sweet
barbecue
sauce
cole
slaw
and
a
baked
potato
andor
corn
on
the
cob
enjoy
overall
ok
but
not
great
somewhat
meh
so
much
going
on
mix
of
good
and
bad
even
the
barrels
have
a
mix
of
good
and
bad
just
a
taste
for
me
and
probably
wont
get
this
again
o
im
not
completely
overwhelmed
but
this
could
really
grow
on
me
will
buy
again
o
a
unique
brew
with
a
lot
of
flavor
i
prefer
their
plain
rum
cask
aged
but
this
is
a
good
winterholiday
seasonal
o
a
very
tastey
beer
with
a
unique
character
i
assume
the
molasses
is
to
provide
sweetness
and
increase
the
body
not
being
very
familiar
with
molasses
as
a
food
i
cant
tell
if
it
imparts
any
flavor
beer
sitting
in
clear
bottles
under
fluorescent
lighting
has
to
be
suspect
looks
more
like
a
barleywine
than
a
porter
dark
crimson
ruby
brown
appearance
light
khaki
tan
head
forms
fine
lacing
down
the
sides
of
my
glass
aroma
has
sweet
brown
sugar
glazed
apple
a
hint
of
spice
alcohol
and
oak
barrel
aging
effects
the
first
sip
is
cloying
all
day
alcohol
burn
at
only
7
4
thats
just
sad
with
a
watery
beer
supposedly
aged
on
oak
to
unlock
the
flavor
these
guys
are
brewing
half
ass
beer
so
far
nothing
ive
had
from
them
have
been
nearly
acceptable
to
call
this
base
beer
a
porter
is
sacrilege
theres
no
rounded
sweetness
this
is
really
harsh
on
the
palate
flavor
and
mouthfeel
watery
texture
with
these
big
oak
character
with
alcohol
levels
that
are
unrelenting
for
such
a
modest
abv
just
unbalanced
overall
a
no
go
for
me
its
going
to
make
picking
out
another
innis
and
gunn
to
try
that
much
harder
overall
i
was
not
particularly
keen
on
it
i
was
really
just
hoping
for
something
passable
but
no
pours
a
clear
dark
copper
with
a
foamy
khaki
head
that
fades
to
nothing
no
lacing
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
toasted
malt
caramel
toffee
and
slight
molasses
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
sweet
caramel
toffee
and
dark
fruit
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
woody
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
an
above
average
beer
that
is
very
sweet
and
not
too
much
like
a
porter
in
my
opinion
tasteoakey
sweet
toasted
malt
some
vanilla
notes
warming
alcohol
in
the
finish
rather
smooth
interesting
flavor
the
taste
has
a
lightly
roasted
malt
character
but
it
is
more
overwhelmed
by
the
vanilla
or
molasses
the
alcohol
could
be
better
integrated
because
it
had
a
slight
boozy
feel
no
smoke
like
i
like
in
porters
so
im
reviewing
this
a
porter
but
i
really
dont
think
of
this
as
one
it
pours
like
a
dark
brown
ale
with
minimal
head
doesnt
look
like
any
porter
ive
ever
had
the
smell
is
all
sweet
molasses
which
right
out
of
the
gate
i
know
this
isnt
going
to
work
for
me
since
i
love
true
porters
and
molasses
doesnt
seem
like
a
good
fit
i
will
say
they
taste
isnt
all
that
bad
the
molasses
is
obviously
there
with
hints
of
oak
and
vanilla
like
there
other
brews
it
does
have
a
small
porter
bitternessburnt
aftertaste
but
you
really
have
to
be
searching
for
it
overall
if
this
was
considered
a
dark
ale
with
molasses
id
think
much
more
of
this
but
since
they
want
it
to
be
a
porter
ill
rate
it
as
a
porter
which
is
maybe
a
little
better
than
i
thought
but
still
nothing
id
buy
again
o
a
nice
treat
every
now
and
then
as
it
is
definitely
on
the
sweeter
side
very
easy
to
drink
while
providing
a
nice
complexity
displays
the
oak
nicely
so
its
a
good
into
to
oaked
beers
as
well
my

first
to
review
this
beer
wife
got
there
first
but
couldnt
find
listing
so
i
get
to
jump
on
it
this
is
an
oak
aged
porter
with
molasses
added
it
is
good
but
not
one
of
ig
better
offerings
doesnt
seem
to
be
as
full
bodied
as
our
domestic
porters
has
a
nice
rich
floral
smell
cant
say
that
i
detected
the
presence
of
the
molasses
i
am
neutral
on
this
beer
interesting
beergood
after
dinner
i
had
it
in
london
out
of
the
bottle
i
wouldnt
want
this
to
be
my
everyday
drink
poured
deep
amber
with
little
to
no
head
very
carbonated
oak
and
vanilla
notes
pull
strong
through
the
nose
very
satisfying
smell
feels
light
in
the
mouth
starts
off
slightly
sweet
then
transitions
to
zesty
as
it
hits
the
back
of
your
mouth
poured
a
dark
amber
with
minimal
head
rich
aroma
warm
tastes
not
very
carbonated
classic
skunked
ig
smell
taste
is
sweet
caramel
oak
and
skunkiness
this
is
awful
but
oddly
enough
i
will
not
drain
pour
this
very
light
pleasant
and
enjoyable
not
a
remarkable
beer
but
a
nice
one
overall
really
nice
coldweather
flavors
in
a
relatively
low
abv
perfect
for
fall
great
base
beer
and
the
oak
makes
it
better

with
a

of
smooth

and
a
hint
of
vanilla
in
there
nice

full

very
slight

and

medium

definitely
drinkable
but
perhaps
could
be
improved
with
a
little
less
oak
overall
a
british
ale
but
malty
and
sweet
drinkable
i
for
one
am
very
happy
for
this
accident
of
a
beer
and
glad
that
many
others
have
enjoyed
it
as
well
and
made
it
so
widely
available
innis
and
gunn
have
since
expanded
the
brand
and
made
many
wonderful
variations
picked
up
a
mixed
4
pack
of
innis
and
gunn
because
i
am
scottish
good
looking
and
smelling
beer
with
an
outstanding
flavor
one
of
better
beers
for
me
so
far
but
not
a
great
value
overall
do
to
cost
versus
quality
probably
wont
try
again
but
certainly
would
drink
if
available
this
is
a
pretty
low
key
barrel
aged
beer
probably
good
for
people
who
want
to
try
the
style
without
diving
in
too
deeply
food
match
a
classic
english
sunday
roast
would
sort
this
ale
out
quicktime
dont
forget
the
yorkshire
pudding
the
smooth
full
body
an
do
skinless
of
this
beer
was
really
different
to
anything
i
have
tasted
they
must
really
chip
this
beer
to
get
that
oak
flavour
but
there
is
a
lovely
vanilla
flavour
to
it
as
well
which
lightens
the
taste
nice
head
held
by
the
wheat
a
vey
satisfying
beer
i
a
rather
small
bottle
o
i
couldnt
finish
the
beer
the
oak
bourbon
taste
and
skunk
smell
were
too
much
i
was
looking
for
something
different
and
thought
id
give
it
a
try
i
wont
be
returning
had
on
tap
for
the
purpose
of
this
review
but
have
tried
this
from
the
bottle
on
many
prior
occasions
this
was
one
of
the
brews
that
first
introduced
me
to
a
life
beyond
molson
pilsener
and
other
industrial
lagers
it
is
widely
available
and
the
description
on
the
bottle
sparks
considerable
interest
whiskey
and
vanilla
eh
alright
a
reddish
bronze
beer
with
unassuming
white
foam
smells
like
mellow
brown
sugar
or
butterscotch
what
i
would
describe
as
a
corn
sugar
sort
of
sweetness
hints
of
floral
vanilla
and
green
grass
and
a
dry
oakiness
that
evokes
whiskey
tastes
much
like
it
smells
with
the
same
basic
elements
just
listed
except
that
the
taste
is
much
more
woody
dry
and
somewhat
earthy
less
sweet
than
the
aroma
would
suggest
and
feels
somewhat
like
a
lager
thinnish
body
and
rather
assertive
carbonation
hints
of
bread
crust
tobacco
and
some
other
floral
note
flit
in
and
out
of
the
whiskylike
woody
semisweet
murk
its
just
ok
in
my
view
i
prefer
a
few
other
innis
gunn
offerings
the
vanilla
is
great
but
id
tone
down
the
barrel
flavor
and
amp
up
the
caramel
thicken
up
the
body
and
add
a
few
extra
layers
of
flavor
o
this
beer
really
makes
me
appreciate
and
recognize
the
characteristics
wood
aging
can
impart
its
a
simple
beer
with
a
boost
from
the
oak
overall
this
is
a
very
great
tasting
beer
feels
nice
in
the
mouth
and
almost
a
luxurious
taste
a
little
more
sweet
than
i
normally
like
but
this
is
not
a
downfall
as
it
is
pretty
balanced
reminds
me
of
juice
or
vanilla
cake
a
little
less
complex
than
i
imagined
but
this
was
brewed
very
well
and
there
are
other
beers
by
innis
gunn
that
have
darker
more
bitter
notes
definitely
no
hoppy
taste
in
this
one
more
carbonation
would
be
nice
very
well
done
and
a
pleasing
beer
i
almost
drank
the
whole
beer
whilst
writing
this
review
this
beer
has
a
good
body
appropriate
for
style
an
even
medium
strength
with
some
heft
but
not
thickness
and
brightness
lightly
crisp
and
plenty
smooth
its
semidry
for
the
entirety
of
every
sip
beyond
the
sweeter
opening
o
well
you
cant
say
this
beer
doesnt
showcase
the
oak
aging
unfortunately
aside
from
the
wood
there
just
isnt
much
there
overall
a
great
representation
of
the
style
o
a
nice
oak
aged
beer
that
displays
the
barrels
nicely
not
to
much
in
the
way
of
the
barrel
so
it
really
shines
through
a
good
dessert
beer
because
of
the
sweetness
but
not
a
bad
anytime
beer
either
overall
very
good
indeed
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
scottish
ales
per
se
but
this
one
id
get
again
without
reservation
very
drinkable
and
complex
o
as
my
first
time
trying
this
i
walked
away
with
a
pretty
nice
impression
of
it
although
i
read
a
description
of
the
beer
before
i
ordered
the
beer
just
destroyed
any
expectation
i
had
of
it
in
a
good
way
this
may
not
be
the
best
beer
to
try
for
those
just
getting
into
it
but
everyone
should
try
it
at
least
once
very
pleasant
and
mellow
overall
sometimes
you
just
want
a
mellow
beer
with
the
barrel
aged
characteristics
and
innis
gunn
provides
that
nice
pint
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
beer
was
its
complex
flavoring
while
each
component
was
decently
represented
in
quality
the
variety
of
fruits
malts
oak
and
liquored
flavoring
was
quite
impressive
with
each
sip
you
were
given
all
of
that
european
whiskey
flavoring
without
all
of
that
fusel
alcoholic
afterpunch
the
feel
was
thin
and
overly
prickled
for
the
style
contributing
little
and
only
minimally
enhancing
the
experience
otherwise
the
aroma
and
the
taste
were
wrought
with
sweet
and
bready
esters
which
by
the
end
effectively
drowned
out
a
lot
of
those
initial
intricacies
o
great
oak
aged
beer
a
real
joy
to
sip
on
in
bad
weather
o
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
though
sweet
with
strong
vanilla
and
cherry
flavours
this
beer
goes
down
very
well
the
worst
beer
that
ive
ever
had
pours
a
clear
caramel
color
with
a
multitude
of
bubbles
clinging
to
the
side
of
the
glass
zero
head
present
along
with
minimal
lacing
the
nose
has
a
decidedly
lager
like
character
with
faint
notes
of
caramel
malt
and
oak
not
really
getting
any
of
what
i
would
classify
as
scottish
character
the
taste
features
plenty
of
oak
mellow
bourbon
and
vanilla
character
and
again
a
dry
bready
lager
yeast
character
the
taste
is
rather
thin
and
seems
to
have
more
flavor
from
the
oak
than
from
the
base
beer
mouthfeel
is
way
over
carbonated
with
a
very
light
body
this
one
is
not
working
well
for
me
kinda
reminds
me
of
the
ab
winter
cask
ale
bland
and
watery
with
some
vanilla
and
oak
character
for
what
it
is
a
scottish
ale
that
emphasizes
oak
aging
its
a
solid
beer
not
a
lot
of
bite
or
umph
to
it
but
has
nice
flavor
and
body
to
it
and
the
oak
is
balanced
in
the
palate
nicely
a
beer
youd
enjoy
were
it
a
soft
drink
sweet
and
natural
tasting
it
is
satisfying
with
taste
you
cant
ignore
if
youd
even
want
to
if
a
bar
serves
this
drink
i
sincerely
recommend
you
take
your
opportunity
to
enjoy
a
sweet
oaky
delight
even
if
the
price
makes
you
hesitant

o
this
is
definitely
a
mild
beer
used
to
highlight
the
barrelaged
flavors
i
prefer
a
solid
beer
with
barrelaged
notes
its
not
bad
but
not
worth
choosing
over
the
many
other
barrelaged
beers
out
there
not
a
big
fan
of
the
innis
and
gunn
beers
seem
kind
of
mellow
to
me
and
a
bit
bland
normally
i
would
be
more
neutral
but
this
beer
had
spice
notes
which
put
me
off
this
didnt
look
or
smell
like
much
but
it
was
deceptively
complex
the
typical
caramel
apple
and
butterscotch
notes
are
there
the
oak
adds
some
vanilla
and
woody
earthy
notes
as
well
its
not
great
but
its
worth
a
try
to
the
average
casual
lager
drinker
innis
and
gunn
original
is
mindshattering
stuff
to
many
in
the
craft
beer
world
innis
and
gunn
is
kitschy
and
underwhelming
ive
always
felt
that
the
truth
lay
somewhere
in
the
middle
regardless
of
your
tastes
this
brewery
has
made
a
lot
of
headway
in
expanding
the
palates
and
minds
of
the
general
public
o
a
very
unique
and
interesting
beer
if
youre
in
the
right
mood
for
it
its
an
excellent
beer
id
drink
again
m
very
smooth
little
carbonation
medium
body
crisp
finish
alcohol
not
very
noticeable
o
best
ale
we
tried
in
the
uk
smooth
bourbony
and
delicious
highly
recommended
do
not
drink
this
straight
out
of
the
bottle
pour
it
into
a
glass
like
any
nuanced
beer
the
aromas
bloom
when
allowed
to
open
up
this
beer
you
can
drink
it
10000
different
times
and
pick
up
something
else
that
you
like
about
it
every
time
you
drink
it
i
highly
suggest
drinking
this
beer
if
you
like
a
beer
that
has
a
hint
of
oak
and
a
smooth
after
taste
also
try
this
with
any
kind
of
buttery
meal
ie
a
steak
with
butter
on
it
or
a
pork
chop
with
mash
potatoes
and
butter
cheers
thin
head
on
a
clear
bright
golden
body
aroma
is
a
touch
mild
with
oak
and
cedar
wood
dominating
with
notes
of
grain
orange
and
pale
malt
flavor
is
very
bourbon
or
whiskey
like
just
less
sharp
with
oak
in
the
finish
imagine
a
whiskey
that
doesnt
make
take
you
back
that
you
can
take
a
mouthful
of
as
oppose
to
sip
smoothness
of
a
nicely
aged
bourbon
light
to
medium
body
and
light
carbonation
as
a
whiskey
drinker
this
beer
is
both
intriguing
memorable
and
tasty
o
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
decent
kick
good
representation
of
style
its
a
good
beer
but
considering
the
price
there
are
better
alternatives
that
are
similar
and
less
expensive
i
feel
like
this
would
be
better
if
it
came
in
a
darker
bottle
shielded
from
the
light
the
cask
age
didnt
impart
too
much
of
an
oak
flavor
it
would
definitely
be
interesting
to
try
this
beer
if
it
was
aged
a
little
bit
longer
extremely
clear
yellow
orange
pour
into
an
innis
gunn
glass
small
amount
of
head
quickly
diminished
into
a
surrounding
foam
smells
of
bourbon
caramel
oak
very
boozy
smell
smoked
tastes
of
very
light
vanilla
smooth
bourbon
a
semi
sweet
after
taste
of
caramel
and
oak
a
very
nice
mellow
display
of
bourbon
barrel
aging
light
bodied
but
gives
off
a
warming
sensation
that
makes
it
a
slow
drinking
beer
this
is
a
great
anytimer
i
had
been
meaning
to
try
this
beer
for
a
long
time
but
got
carried
away
in
domestic
craft
stuff
so
i
never
got
around
to
this
did
a
trade
with
someone
in
tn
and
they
had
a
3pack
with
a
glass
gift
set
so
he
included
it
in
the
trade
im
very
glad
this
happened
and
i
have
2
other
versions
of
this
beer
to
drink
still
scotch
ales
have
become
a
wild
array
of
different
kinds
of
beer
to
call
this
one
is
no
longer
a
stretch
innis
gunn
sold
me
on
their
oakaged
product
i
love
the
brewery
backstory
and
i
like
the
beer
ive
got
a
couple
of
rum
casks
waiting
to
be
cracked
soon
from
them
stay

not
somwthig
i
would
seek
out
despite
the
slight
skunkiness
i
feel

i
got

what
this

fine
carbonation
as
well
serves
for
a
basically
perfect

interesting
beer
kinda
reminds
me
of
a
weird
sam
smith
pale
ale
but
i
prefer
sam

to
this
i
really
enjoyed

its
an

comwatchv9ap0u9kflyk
overall
a
very
original
and
enjoyable
beer
probably
the
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
from
edinburgh
overall
a
must
this
and
their
rum
cask
are
two
must
tries
however
their
rum
cask
is
superior
dont
pass
on
either
youll
be
cheating
yourself
overall
i
was
impressed
with
this
beer
at
first
the
aroma
turned
me
off
a
little
bit
but
the
taste
and
drinkability
turned
things
around
solid
beer
oveerall
and
cant
wait
to
try
some
of
their
other
brews
an
interesting
effort
but
i
dont
find
myself
falling
in
love
its
biggest
flaw
in
my
opinion
is
the
excess
of
extraneous
flavours
rather
than
an
emphesis
on
the
beer
character
it
has
some
complexity
but
its
too
sweet
with
too
much
toffee
and
vanilla
these
flavours
dominate
everything
else
it
would
be
improved
by
a
more
robust
maltiness
that
stands
up
to
the
oak
and
creates
a
better
balance
anyway
try
it
for
interest
once
od
not
bad
tasty
lacks
complexity
and
is
too
sweet
but
a
tasty
tipple
nonetheless
i
couldnt
have
more
than
one
though
overall
i
wasnt
expecting
much
since
the
clear
bottle
but
i
will
be
damned
if
this
isnt
the
best
scottish
ale
i
ever
drank
medium
sticky
body
nice
sweet
malt
flavors
and
a
low
abv
if
it
was
found
closer
to
me
i
would
enjoy
a
couple
a
sitting
great
beer
o
an
interesting
beer
the
vanilla
flavor
is
a
little
overwhelming
purely
a
sweet
beer
nothing
bitter
here
at
all
the
oak
flavor
intensifies
with
time
as
well
as
a
spicy
sort
of
raisin
note
maybe
a
bit
too
much
for
me
always
wondered
about
this
beer
decent
i
suppose
on
to
the
whiskey
version
next
overall
this
isnt
that
great
of
a
beer
it
is
too
sweet
without
anything
to
balance
it
out
glad
i
got
to
try
it
though
o
the
wood
is
the
dominant
player
but
it
is
not
overpowering
and
gets
some
very
nice
subtle
support
from
the
malt
flavor
underneath
i
was
nervous
about
the
clear
bottles
but
it
was
tasty
and
didnt
suffer
any
noticeable
change
a
satisfying
beer
overall
that
complements
meat
and
potatoes
type
meals
i
want
to
bet
this
is
skunked
in
spite
of
the
low
ibus
but
im
going
to
fault
it
for
that
anyway
because
i
didnt
leave
it
out
in
the
sun
and
even
though
i
cant
speak
for
how
long
it
may
have
been
out
on
the
shelf
in
the
store
its
irresponsible
to
put
beer
in
clear
bottles
no
matter
low
the
hop
content
is
or
how
nice
it
looks
for
the
record
it
does
look
nice
and
i
dont
like
hops
anyway
jurys
still
out
for
me
part
skunky
macro
lager
part
scottish
ale
part
lovely
oak
character
the
pros
and
cons
balance
d
while
i
dont
mind
the
sweet
flavor
an
11
2oz
serving
of
it
is
a
bit
much
like
i
said
its
not
that
the
sweetness
even
needs
to
be
toned
down
just
balanced
a
little
its
good
and
i
enjoyed
it
but
its
not
something
ill
go
looking
for
and
its
not
something
i
could
drink
more
than
one
of
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
a
very
tasty
beer
better
then
the
christmas
ale
they
make
and
on
par
with
the
rum
cask
oak
aged
beer
a
must
try
very
carbonated
and
very
little
head
and
has
a
amber
color
but
does
not
feel
like
a
beer
to
my
taste
buds
just
to
fizzy
for
me
this
poured
out
as
a
amber
color
with
a
cream
colored
foamed
head
that
has
a
very
thin
retention
on
top
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
sweet
a
little
bit
of
wood
on
the
nose
and
some
other
light
earthy
notes
the
taste
of
the
beer
was
much
different
than
most
oak
aged
beers
ive
had
this
one
was
sweet
with
some
hints
of
vanilla
and
caramel
i
was
expecting
a
little
more
of
a
sour
flavor
to
it
but
it
was
way
sweeter
than
expected
the
sweetness
dies
down
a
bit
the
more
you
drink
the
finish
is
grainy
and
dry
with
not
a
lot
of
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
on
the
thin
side
the
carbonation
was
low
also
overall
i
loved
the
look
of
the
beer
in
the
bottle
but
after
having
it
i
wasnt
overly
impressed
i
have
a
bottle
of
the
rum
barrel
version
that
ill
try
one
day
im
hoping
that
one
will
have
a
little
more
depth
to
it
poured
an
amber
in
color
virtually
no
lacing
with
a
very
slight
beige
head
nice
smell
of
vanilla
and
oak
very
much
a
sweet
smell
first
sip
offers
more
carbonation
than
it
looked
with
the
initial
pour
mouthful
semi
thick
must
go
with
the
sweetness
of
this
beer
nice
mixture
of
oak
and
vanilla
in
taste
neither
one
overpowering
overall
not
a
bad
beer
not
one
that
i
would
have
normally
have
bought
it
was
recommended
by
the
owner
of
the
local
package
store
though
i
am
new
to
this
i
try
to
rate
each
beer
on
kind
of
beer
it
is
rather
than
my
personal
preference
so
that
being
said
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
if
i
was
into
this
style
i
would
buy
again
ive
had
a
sample
of
the
rum
cask
before
and
do
remember
enjoying
that
a
bit
more
ill
have
to
get
some
bottles
to
revisit
but
im
beginning
to
have
a
renowned
appreciation
for
this
beer
its
subtly
complex
and
flavorful
while
retaining
an
amazing
balance
this
will
not
be
the
last
4pack
of
this
beer
my
refrigerator
ever
sees
i
hope
more
of
this
beer
is
imported
in
solid
boxes
to
prevent
this
from
being
lightstruck
well
balanced
and
smoky
through
to
the
aftertaste
a
little
lighter
in
body
and
mouthfeel
than
i
prefer
but
definitely
complex
and
interesting
malt
sweetness
breaks
through
for
a
bit
before
being
overwhelmed
in
the
finish
by
the
wood
and
burnt
enjoyable
and
different
and
would
look
great
in
a
classy
brown
bottle
i
started
with
the
rum
cask
ale
first
which
honestly
skewered
my
taste
even
though
its
been
a
few
weeks
this
beer
by
comparison
is
almost
bland
good
but
not
as
good
as
the
rum
12
oz
bottle
poured
into
sam
adams
glass
pours
a
light
amber
with
adequate
head
and
lacing
light
oak
aroma
predominates
just
like
the
bottle
sez
natural
hints
of
toffee
vanilla
and
oak
but
i
also
get
a
slight
scotch
flavor
light
mouthfeel
okay
im
into
hop
bombs
this
is
not
at
all
a
beer
i
should
be
interested
in
but
this
is
fantastic
a
delicate
concoction
so
flavorful
and
yet
so
subtle
and
wellbalanced
overall
a
great
beer
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
o
really
good
scotch
aged
on
oak
pretty
much
a
standard
to
base
most
oaked
scotch
ales
its
really
mild
which
i
like
although
change
the
bottle
to
brown
to
prevent
lightstruck
good
beer
an
a
or
a
in
my
book
o
overall
a
smooth
drinker
as
a
scottish
ale
some
mixed
feelings
the
malting
seemed
a
bit
thin
and
the
toffeecaramel
notes
were
exaggerated
to
the
point
where
it
was
like
a
liquid
twix
candy
bar
the
oaky
vanilla
character
was
a
nice
twist
but
seemed
to
overtake
the
malt
character
of
the
beer
color
was
lighter
then
most
per
style
didnt
have
the
full
malt
body
and
lacked
a
touch
of
smokiness
more
slick
and
wet
then
dry
from
roasted
malting
a
neat
flavor
and
twist
a
bit
deviant
by
style
but
makes
for
an
interesting
try
and
you
cant
fault
that
salud
overall
i
was
happy
to
see
this
one
on
tap
at
a
local
restaurant
its
not
a
mind
blowing
beer
but
the
taste
is
well
balanced
and
its
very
drinkable
i
could
also
see
this
beer
working
well
as
a
gateway
beer
to
get
people
into
craft
a
glass
of
single
malt
scotch
as
a
glass
of
beer
worth
a
shot
pretty
typical
innis
gunn
flavours
overall

the

is
a
jigsaw
with
a
few
pieces
missing
nonetheless
i
recommend
it
especially
to
those
not
spoiled
by
the
rum
cask
like
myself
interestingly
taste
is
unlike
the
smell
and
thats
a
good
thing
aroma
is
typical
lager
runofthemill
beer
but
the
taste
is
anything
but
typical
there
is
a
sweet
toffeeish
taste
this
could
be
fantasticly
refreshing
beer
for
a
hot
summer
day
get
the
gift
pack
as
the
regular
4
packs
are
probably
skunked
to
high
heaven
overall
not
bad
i
can
see
why
this
is
the
top
selling
ukbrewed
beer
in
canada
and
is
starting
to
gain
a
reputation
a
little
here
in
the
states
very
hedonistic
and
so
easy
drinking
in
fact
my
biggest
flaw
with
this
is
how
easygoing
it
is
i
could
kill
a
4pk
in
about
halfanhour
12
oz
into
a
duvel
tulip
probably
not
the
correct
glass
i
guess
the
correct
glass
came
in
this
gift
pack
oh
well
the
tulip
probably
brings
out
the
truer
nose
anyway
appearance
isnt
very
exciting
clean
clear
body
with
a
moderate
head
however
as
soon
as
i
take
a
whiff
this
beer
gets
interesting
lots
of
woodiness
and
a
hint
of
aged
whiskey
perhaps
i
am
imagining
that
as
im
not
sure
they
even
used
whiskey
barrels
mellow
hops
balance
the
beer
but
it
is
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
even
for
a
uk
style
pale
ale
alcohol
content
is
high
and
it
hides
it
well
has
a
lot
of
energy
in
the
mouth
and
is
smooth
not
something
id
drink
every
day
but
recommended
to
try
a
good
example
of
how
to
properly
age
beer
in
barrels
received
a
set
of
three
bottles
as
a
gift
with
an
expiration
date
only
one
month
away
while
the
bottle
was
clear
the
set
came
in
a
cardboard
box
so
the
contents
were
kept
safe
and
tasted
fresh
opened
a
bottle
with
a
pot
pie
dinner
they
color
was
a
bright
copper
color
i
was
a
little
concerned
about
this
being
too
spicy
but
the
scent
is
surprisingly
mild
and
while
it
is
sweet
the
taste
is
not
overpowering
definitely
has
an
oak
aged
taste
but
it
is
surprisingly
light
and
drinkable
the
mouthfeel
was
very
light
but
had
an
appropriately
complex
aftertaste
at
6
6
percent
there
is
no
strong
tinge
of
alcohol
either
it
is
overall
a
good
beer
but
exists
in
a
grey
area
where
i
would
not
want
to
have
46
of
them
but
it
did
not
feel
special
enough
to
be
content
with
just
one
kind
of
a
novelty
but
overall
well
done
overall
certainly
unique
but
those
clear
bottles
are
a
gamble
worth
a
try
if
you
are
down
to
buy
the
gift
pack
and
avoid
skunking
i
was
pleasantry
surprised
by
this
brew
would
highly
recommend
it
i
really
want
to
taste
the
other
oak
aged
brews
in
the
future
this
tasted
a
lot
strong
than
it
actually
was
but
thats
probably
because
this
is
so
distinct
and
didnt
seem
like
beer
at
all
to
me
the
oakamber
hue
and
label
didnt
help
either
but
theres
no
doubt
that
a
brew
like
this
pushes
the
boundaries
of
whats
possible
with
beer
i
cant
say
that
id
always
reach
for
one
of
these
when
im
thirsty
but
im
still
eager
to
try
the
other
2
bottles
in
the
pack
that
this
came
with
supposedly
this
beer
originated
as
flavor
fodder
for
casks
that
would
hold
scotch
id
like
to
try
the
scotch
give
it
a
try
its
quite
different
quite
delightful
pick
this
up
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
the
same
qualities
that
make
it
popular
also
make
it
lessthanexceptional
overall
i
found
this
to
be
a
complex
beer
but
not
muddled
it
all
ties
together
very
well
great
brew
and
a
real
treat
to
get
it
on
tap
out
of
a
bottle
this
beer
was
an
orangeamber
color
with
one
finger
of
offwhite
head
it
laced
in
thin
sliding
bands
and
retained
as
a
collar
the
aroma
was
of
oak
dry
malt
some
nuts
and
a
little
caveaged
must
the
flavors
were
delicious
toasted
malt
sweet
malt
butter
toffee
vanilla
nuts
and
caramel
the
mouthfeel
was
frothy
the
body
medium
and
the
carbonation
medium
oits
an
interesting
and
enjoyable
beer
it
has
some
loose
ends
to
tie
up
and
it
could
be
completely
amazing
unfortunately
we
all
know
that
recipes
in
european
beers
are
rarely
subject
to
change
if
it
tasted
more
like
it
smelled
it
could
be
a
reoccurring
guest
to
my
line
up
overall
i
really
like
this
beer
it
may
not
be
really
complex
but
it
has
a
very
unique
taste
i
have
not
seen
many
oak
aged
beers
i
will
definitely
try
this
again
o
i
think
this
is
a
pretty
solid
brew
i
could
see
myself
picking
up
a
few
bottles
at
my
local
bottle
shop
if
i
was
in
the
mood
for
a
light
sweet
beer
with
solid
flavors
i
wouldnt
have
this
again
but
would
not
say
its
a
bad
beer
just
not
my
cup
of
tea
o
interesting
flavor
combination
a
pale
ale
but
more
like
a
scotch
ale
after
so
many
people
raved
about
it
recently
i
figured
id
give
this
brew
a
shot
it
pours
a
clear
sunset
amber
topped
by
a
halffinger
of
dirty
offwhite
foam
the
nose
is
kinda
weak
comprising
light
toffee
honey
very
light
greens
sweet
flowers
and
a
touch
of
wheat
bread
the
taste
is
more
robust
with
notes
of
caramel
vanilla
light
wet
oak
maple
syrup
light
honey
sweet
flowers
and
wet
heather
its
a
unique
flavor
combination
to
say
the
least
but
it
all
ends
up
making
me
smile
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
mild
carbonation
and
a
slickly
smooth
feel
overall
an
interesting
tasty
brew
one
that
lived
up
to
the
praise
heaped
upon
it
round
here
odthis
is
a
love
it
or
hate
it
beer
i
happen
to
love
whiskey
and
scotch
i
also
happen
to
enjoy
this
beer
its
all
oak
not
much
malt
no
hops
it
interesting
and
i
enjoyed
it
but
would
not
regularly
drink
it
they
definitely
accomplished
their
goal
here
so
impressed
by
the
oak
overall
this
is
a
rather
good
beer
but
its
just
not
fully
top
tier
to
me
i
greatly
prefer
their
rum
barrel
aged
to
me
thats
the
step
up
into
the
mid
to
high
a
range
o
didnt
really
like
the
look
and
feel
of
the
beer
they
go
together
i
guess
for
me
the
sweetness
and
buttery
flavor
knocked
a
point
or
two
off
the
overall
beer
price
point
got
this
4pk
for
8
99
o
a
good
but
not
great
beer
enjoyed
it
but
not
looking
for
another
anytime
soon
it
served
as
a
nice
nightcap
for
me
i
dont
think
ill
get
this
again
not
bad
but
not
great
o
beer
is
exactly
what
is
says
it
is
an
oak
aged
beer
and
it
tastes
just
like
that
but
almost
like
i
have
a
piece
of
oak
in
my
mouth
and
not
in
my
beer
would
probably
pass
on
this
the
next
time
i
come
across
it
but
worth
a
try
o
i
rathered
enjoyed
thsi
beer
not
something
i
would
seek
out
but
it
was
good
and
i
would
definitely
get
it
again
this
is
more
a
sipper
than
a
session
ale
but
regardless
its
a
tasty
beer
and
a
fine
scottish
ale
wasnt
sure
if
i
was
a
fan
of
oakaged
beer
after
trying
igs
blonde
ale
but
i
found
this
stuff
quite
a
bit
more
enjoyable
definitely
worth
a
try
o
excellent
bee
with
a
unique
and
wonderfully
nutty
and
caramel
flavor
that
would
take
you
from
wood
to
caramelized
vanilla
o
an
easy
drinker
due
to
the
sweetness
i
consider
this
a
dessert
beer
or
a
digestif
due
to
its
taste
profile
this
cannot
be
compared
to
traditional
brews
of
any
sort
it
has
a
full
mouthfeel
and
definitely
not
a
session
beer
a
great
beer
for
one
or
two
on
a
cold
night
poured
a
2
white
head
which
disappeared
completely
pretty
fast
body
is
a
clear
light
tea
yellowbrown
smell
was
the
biggest
putoff
because
thanks
to
the
clear
glass
bottle
and
time
on
the
shelf
it
was
moderately
skunked
taste
surprisingly
showed
none
of
the
skunking
and
had
very
mild
toffee
and
vanilla
like
the
label
advertised
but
milder
than
i
expected
body
is
lighter
weight
than
id
anticipate
from
barrel
aging
just
a
step
up
from
water
all
in
all
enjoyable
flavor
but
hardly
worth
the
hype
body
is
admittedly
a
bit
thin
and
watery
though
not
a
dealbreaker
carbonation
is
light
the
flavors
carry
it
basically
not
bad
could
easily
have
a
couple
far
better
than
the
rum
cask
version
that
we
tried
recently
expecting
an
aged
english
pale
ale
to
be
hoppy
is
like
expecting
a
puppy
to
be
well
behaved
without
training
i
saw
that
this
was
being
imported
into
the
us
thought
it
important
to
offer
my
opinion
directly
and
clearly
avoid
this
beer
o
not
my
style
way
too
sweet
without
many
true
beer
attributes
i
would
not
buy
this
again
for
myself
though
my
girlfriend
did
like
it
really
not
much
to
say
about
this
beer
o
this
is
a
good
beer
it
tastes
like
wood
but
none
the
less
it
is
good
it
tastes
like
it
looks
much
better
than
how
it
smells
or
feels
o
best
beer
ive
had
out
of
a
clear
bottle
wouldnt
drink
very
often
personally
but
would
never
refuse
if
offered
overall
great
beer
this
is
possibly
a
taste
best
suited
for
those
who
also
like
whiskeybourbon
but
is
a
brilliant
beer
all
round
and
i
highly
recommend
picking
up
a
bottle
if
given
the
chance
you
wont
regret
it
a
good
brew
i
have
had
it
in
my
hands
a
few
time
and
never
pulled
the
plug
on
buying
it
i
will
the
next
time
i
see
it
though
this
beer
poured
a
slighty
darker
yellow
color
with
a
decent
size
head
that
didnt
hang
around
too
long
the
smell
was
almost
a
bit
sweet
with
a
strong
toffee
aroma
the
taste
was
complex
while
on
the
lighter
side
for
an
epa
there
was
a
strong
vanilla
and
toffee
flavor
a
bit
of
the
oak
from
the
ageing
barrel
can
be
tasted
as
well
the
flavor
could
be
a
bit
stronger
espically
for
an
epa
no
hops
or
bitterness
was
present
overall
a
very
intresting
beer
but
very
good
it
is
not
what
you
expect
this
one
pours
a
clear
pale
golden
color
with
a
nice
big
loose
white
foamy
head
that
fades
to
surface
after
an
enjoyable
hang
time
visibly
effervescent
throughout
the
entire
sample
another
big
plus
the
nose
is
huge
all
about
the
sweet
vanilla
malty
creme
brulee
by
far
the
most
distinguishable
and
prevalent
character
of
this
beverage
the
texture
is
light
well
carbonated
and
super
creamy
the
vanilla
flavor
from
the
nose
is
true
to
taste
along
with
big
rye
whiskey
character
thats
what
im
talking
about
very
nicely
done
the
oak
aged
treatment
is
really
significant
and
it
lingers
really
nicely
in
the
aftertaste
adding
significant
value
to
the
entire
experience
surprisingly
low
abv
only
6
6
all
in
all
a
very
drinkable
ale
very
nice
effort
from
the
folks
back
in
the
home
country
this
one
is
probably
taking
hits
for
the
atypical
interpretation
of
the
style
but
its
a
damn
fine
drinker
its
popularity
in
these
parts
and
has
earned
itself
permanent
cooler
real
estate
at
my
favorite
watering
hole
i
recommend
picking
up
this
bottle
because
it
is
very
original
have
a
new
experience
very
rich
and
full
flavor
in
this
beer
sweet
with
a
balanced
harshbitter
component
will
be
sampling
again
very
soon
please
try
this
i
love
to
drink
this
with
a
toasted
oatmeal
raisin
muffin
with
a
good
knob
of
grassfed
unsalted
sweet
cream
butter
and
top
it
with
a
tiny
sprinkle
of
maldon
sea
salt
flakes
i
promise
you
that
its
bewilderingly
good
decent
beer
but
not
as
good
as
i
remember
it
but
that
was
prior
to
trying
a
lot
of
great
beers
i
have
a
bit
of
a
personal
aversion
to
skunkiness
in
beers
and
this
one
triggers
it
for
me
for
some
reason
so
its
probably
a
toss
up
between
my
taste
being
more
refined
and
this
one
being
slightly
off
ill
have
to
try
another
to
see
which
it
is
overall
a
fantastic
beer
my
1
pick
for
the
style
this
is
overall
a
great
beer
i
think
i
could
have
drunken
lots
of
over
a
session
o
a
fine
ale
somewhat
reminiscent
of
a
good
scotch
oaky
and
peaty
with
a
strong
taste
of
malts
although
its
relatively
thin
and
very
drinkable
its
best
enjoyed
as
a
sipper
due
to
the
strong
sweetness
and
vanilla
flavour
o
some
tasty
flavours
though
the
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
of
a
drawback
the
peaty
oak
flavours
nicely
complemented
the
ale
and
the
sweetness
made
for
an
enjoyable
experience
drinkability
a
nice
light
and
mild
brew
with
a
light
and
sweet
flavour
almost
like
a
nectar
abarwithnoname
wordpress
com
o
decent
flavorful
beer
price
was
great
too
may
give
this
another
go
o
very
pleasant
beer
a
loweralcohol
sipper
which
is
interesting
definitely
seems
as
if
it
is
much
more
alcoholic
probably
due
to
the
liquorlike
flavors
than
it
actually
is
da
very
nice
easy
drinking
beer
i
wish
they
came
in
6
packs
d
so
pleasantly
surprised
this
is
like
an
extremely
smooth
single
malt
scotch
that
somehow
became
a
beer
rich
in
flavour
to
the
point
that
you
wouldnt
want
to
session
it
but
could
be
enjoyed
very
regularly
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
ever
had
the
pleasure
of
tasting
it
has
so
many
layers
of
flavor
you
get
a
new
one
with
each
drink
there
are
many
pleasant
notes
of
vanilla
maple
and
in
some
instances
chocolate
i
could
drink
this
all
the
time
and
im
sure
it
would
go
great
with
any
meal
perhaps
not
a
good
beer
for
a
hot
day
in
the
summer
as
its
full
of
flavor
the
best
part
is
that
you
get
all
of
the
flavor
yet
it
doesnt
sit
heavily
in
your
stomach
which
is
a
plus
try
this
beer
youll
like
it
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
and
easy
to
drink
it
is
really
expensive
though
id
rather
spend
10
on
a
bottle
of
trappist
ale
something
from
southern
tier
or
a
46
pack
of
founders
something
im
happy
i
got
to
try
it
though
thanks
scott
s
drinkability
i
could
probably
do
two
to
sweet
for
anymore
still
thats
more
than
you
can
say
for
many
scot
ales
frothy
creamcolored
head
over
a
gorgeous
wood
brown
aromas
are
oak
and
theres
a
hint
of
skunk
this
bottle
may
have
seen
a
bit
of
sunshine
the
rum
flavors
are
overwhelming
and
i
guess
id
rather
have
rum
than
skunk
malty
sweetness
not
much
by
way
of
hoppiness
i
couldnt
have
more
than
one
of
these
beers
at
a
time
but
im
impressed
in
the
sense
that
ive
never
had
such
a
low
abv
pale
ale
with
such
a
massive
liquor
flavor
drinkability
though
the
lack
of
head
and
lacing
was
initially
offputting
a
few
whiffs
of
the
sweet
aromas
in
my
glass
turned
everything
in
the
right
direction
the
complexity
of
the
taste
and
smooth
mouthfeel
gives
this
beer
a
nice
finish
d
when
i
first
had
this
i
was
wowed
by
the
whisky
character
this
time
i
wasnt
impressed
but
there
again
my
palate
has
changed
somewhat
still
its
a
nice
beer
to
sip
on
though
drinkability
its
a
very
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
with
great
flavours
and
aromas
however
the
vanilla
could
be
a
factor
as
in
to
how
many
you
can
drink
having
said
that
its
an
overall
great
tasting
ale
gotta
wonder
if
there
is
some
adjunct
present
and
adding
to
its
girth
but
not
necessarily
the
body
and
id
have
a
helluva
time
putting
it
into
a
style
category
no
matter
its
uniquely
tasty
smooth
and
complex
m
light
to
medium
body
with
some
chew
lightly
carbonated
a
750ml
bottle
is
almost
too
much
to
handle
in
one
sitting
the
flavor
of
this
beer
is
truly
excellent
but
i
find
the
entire
experience
is
a
lot
like
eating
homemade
fudge
as
terrific
as
it
tastes
eventually
one
wants
something
else
an
absolute
must
try
something
to
sip
slowly
with
friends
if
you
have
a
larger
bottle
great
stuff
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
although
the
diacetyl
might
be
offputting
for
some
i
think
it
is
a
unique
quality
that
you
dont
find
too
often
i
look
forward
to
trying
more
from
ig
has
a
good
mouthfeel
and
is
overall
a
good
solid
beer
i
enjoyed
very
much
drinkability
flavors
make
this
one
a
little
harder
to
drink
wouldnt
want
more
than
23
a
night
especially
at
the
cost
per
bottle
however
those
23
would
be
very
much
enjoyed
bottom
line
i
couldnt
find
one
special
characteristic
of
this
beer
that
separated
it
from
others
but
i
also
could
not
find
any
faults
mouthfeel
fairly
thick
texture
lends
itself
to
holding
the
butterscotchy
oak
this
ale
is
pretty
much
mediumbodied
considering
the
heavy
sweetness
of
this
beer
it
thankfully
isnt
too
thick
drinkability
is
only
average
for
me
the
diacetyl
and
the
oak
chip
wood
pulp
flavors
make
for
something
id
only
want
to
have
one
bottle
of
its
not
unenjoyable
just
a
sipper
d
a
nice
ale
for
a
cold
night
by
the
fire
like
i
enjoy
my
scotch
not
an
ale
that
i
would
go
all
night
on
not
the
type
of
beer
you
would
pound
with
hot
dogs
at
a
ball
game
its
a
beer
to
enjoy
at
your
leisure
i
cant
wait
to
have
more
d
i
think
this
one
would
definitely
be
a
little
too
heavy
on
the
sweetness
and
vanilla
to
make
the
grade
as
a
session
beer
overall
a
very
flavorful
and
interesting
beer
the
combination
of
tastes
go
well
together
although
the
powerful
taste
and
price
would
prevent
you
from
drinking
more
then
one
a
night
it
is
definitely
a
treat
this
is
some
beer
and
adventure
a
type
of
a
style
not
seen
here
in
albany
where
american
pale
ales
rule
unfortunately
only
11
2
oz
bottles
overall
a
nice
beer
worth
trying
if
you
see
it
every
once
and
a
while
i
have
one
of
these
but
i
often
find
myself
waiting
for
special
releases
opposed
to
buying
the
original
i
am
really
enjoying
this
and
think
its
a
very
enjoyable
beer
d
its
not
that
this
beer
is
undrinkable
rather
its
really
hard
for
me
to
get
past
the
fact
that
i
feel
like
the
brewer
is
trying
to
cover
up
a
bad
tasting
beer
with
some
barrelaging
vanilla
and
woody
notes
are
nice
but
the
metallic
and
skunky
taste
in
the
background
is
unmistakable
and
really
ruin
it
for
me
ill
pass
next
time
d
this
one
is
a
one
and
done
for
me
drainpour
the
price
of
importing
beer
d
a
very
good
beer
though
the
power
of
the
vanilla
flavor
might
limit
how
many
of
these
i
could
have
in
a
night
d
this
is
the
first
of
4
that
ill
be
tasting
from
innis
gunn
this
one
was
dominated
by
whiskey
and
vanilla
not
exactly
my
favorite
beer
but
if
you
love
whiskey
or
vanilla
youll
for
sure
enjoy
this
beer
o
i
like
this
beer
okay
and
the
taste
is
unique
but
dont
know
that
im
blown
away
with
it
the
alcohol
hint
to
finish
is
annoying
to
me
theres
better
that
costs
less
had
potential
but
the
skunk
got
in
the
way
would
like
to
try
this
on
tap
pours
a
copperorange
colour
with
thin
white
head
head
dissipates
quick
enough
with
a
faint
hint
of
some
lacing
smells
of
sweet
oaky
vanilla
with
butterscotch
no
hops
or
bitterness
present
in
flavour
or
nose
very
sweet
flavour
lots
of
vanilla
i
think
this
beer
is
too
light
to
hold
up
to
the
oak
flavour
but
it
isnt
bad
ok
carbonation
d
such
a
beautifully
balanced
beer
that
gets
trashed
with
skunk
such
complex
flavor
profiles
and
subtle
notes
i
love
vanilla
so
i
am
very
forgiving
on
this
beer
but
the
skunk
it
gets
from
being
in
a
clear
bottle
just
slaps
the
delicious
in
the
face
let
this
one
breath
for
a
while
as
it
gets
better
as
it
warms
maybe
ill
find
one
of
these
that
hasnt
had
so
much
light
exposure
or
maybe
ill
just
try
to
clone
it
and
put
it
in
a
brown
bottle
poured
from
a
clear
bottle
into
my
room
temperature
glass
resulting
in
a
one

i
like
the
flavor
a
lot
although
a
little
pricey
i
would
buy
a
few
for
my
own
enjoyment
and
maybe
some
for
my
closest
friends
who
like
beer
i
have
liked
this
beer
since
the
first
time
i
tried
it
i
find
it
quite
different
from
other
ales
and
try
to
enjoy
it
on
special
occasions
this
beer
is
delicious
i
would
not
be
able
to
finish
a
40
on
my
own
as
it
was
quite
heavy
on
the
stomach
but
this
to
me
is
a
dessert
beer
something
you
would
have
after
a
good
meal
if
you
have
room
left
afterwards
i
wanted
coffee
this
beer
isnt
going
to
be
for
everyone
but
it
was
absolutely
worth
trying
i
have
to
say
im
impressed
with
this
with
how
cheesy
the
bottle
looks
and
even
being
called
something
like
innis

when

of

against

do

feel
not
my
personal
preference
it
is
surprisingly
complex
and
enjoyable
taste
and
mouthfeel
are
mediocre
not
an
everyday
beer
but
i
recommend
trying
it
if
you
canantilochusdec

d
the
strong
flavours
fairly
high
abv
would
limit
the
drinkability
of
this

a
good
one

then
id
recommend
trying
at
least
once

into

a
this
really
really
looks
like
cream

maybe
its
the
clear

it
pours
the
color
of

maybe
a
shade
more

with
very
very
light
bright
white
head
that
goes
away
almost

it

justice
pretty

the
oak
aging
gives
it
a
great
character
but
its
not
overwhelming
at
all
really
solid
beer
outside
of
the
appearance
this
is
a
fantastic
ale
it
poured
a
crystal
clear
orange
bronze
colour
with
a
pretty
large
white
head
i
wasnt
a
fan
of
the
lack
of
cloudiness
or
haze
the
clarity
was
a
bit
of
a
turn
off
for
me
the
smell
however
was
stunning
i
thought
so
anyway
very
oaky
this
smell
like
a
damp
piece
of
freshly
split
oaken
firewood
with
a
pinch
of
brown
sugar
woody
notes
really
seem
to
come
through
this
one
on
the
finish
accompanied
by
what
almost
seems
to
me
a
very
muted
whiskey
profile
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
and
seems
lightly
but
pleasantly
carbonated
this
is
simply
wonderful
this
is
a
very
good
beer
to
sit
back
and
enjoyvery
flavorsome
but
not
something
you
want
to
drink
too
much
ofgood
to
sip
and
enjoy
the
flavorsnot
to
pound
back
thats
for
sure
will
definately
buy
again
just
to
have
for
those
special
occasions
or
those
quiet
evenings
laying
back
and
enjoying
a
good
flavorsome
beer
its
like
having
a
beer
and
a
shot
of
whiskey

straw
with
some
decent
lacing
aroma
is
faint
but
does
have
a
hint
of
whiskey
to
it
the
taste
has
more
than
a
hint
of
the
whiskey
although
it
is
still
a
bit
light
overall
it
does
go
down
quite
nicely
drinkability
is
alright
its
a
nice
sipping
beer
but
butter
aroma
mars
the
experience
havent
seen
it
mentioned
in
other
reviews
so
im
going
to
try
this
one
again
in
the
future
d
interesting
not
a
session
beer
by
any
means
but
one
i
would
eagerly
enjoy
later
in
the
evening
i
find
it
very
drinkable
since
it
has
many
of
the
attributes
i
like
in
my
single
malts
with
the
oak
vanilla
and
smoke
i
recommend
that
all
beer
lovers
give
this
brew
a
try
i
tried
this
after
purchasing
it
at
my
local
lcbo
store
it
was
a
nice
clear
bottle
the
beer
poured
a
coppery
red
colour
into
the
glass
with
a
1
finger
creamy
white
head
that
dissipated
quickly
to
leave
a
little
trace
on
top
the
smell
was
rather
foul
to
say
the
least
almost
sour
the
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
slightly
thick
with
an
idea
level
of
carbonation
the
taste
is
good
with
some
hints
of
malt
and
fruit
although
i
cant
place
the
sweetness
offhand
the
taste
was
a
similar
delicate
mix
of
several
different
flavours
starting
herbal
and
subtly
hoppy
but
yielding
to
a
sweet
toffee
sensation
vanilla
again
and
a
dry
finish
a
bit
rummy
too
mediumbodied
and
low
carbonation
overall
i
am
very
impressed
id
be
interested
in
tasting
this
before
its
aged
it
seems
like
it
would
not
be
anywhere
near
as
interesting
without
the
aging
id
imagine
it
would
still
be
a
good
beer
but
this
beer
is
all
about
the
subtleties
found
in
the
aging
process
highly
recommended
drinkability
this
is
a
very
different
beer
and
one
that
took
a
sip
or
two
to
figure
out
but
i
must
say
that
if
you
like
the
taste
of
whisky
you
are
going
to
like
the
taste
of
this
one
a
clear
bottle
always
makes
me
nervous
and
this
beer
was
somewhat
skunky
so
this
review
might
be
considered
atypical
but
not
unfair
if
you
use
a
clear
bottle
you
take
your
chances
it
had
a
golden
pale
caramel
color
with
some
malty
aroma
finding
its
way
through
the
skunkiness
there
wasnt
a
lot
of
flavor
a
little
oak
up
front
but
otherwise
this
struck
me
as
a
fairly
standard
eurolager
the
finish
was
smooth
and
clean
average
at
best
color
is
a
beautiful
honeyamber
promising
a
good
ale
experience
aroma
has
strong
fruity
overtones
flavor
has
a
brandylike
bite
but
is
otherwise
fairly
typical
of
a
good
ale
with
smokyburnt
undertones
and
just
a
hint
of
apple
or
pear
smooth
yet
edgy
this
is
a
beer
made
for
sipping
rather
than
guzzling
very
nice
if
you
like
a
sweetmalt
type
of
beer
barrel
adds
some
nice
new
dimensions
but
doesnt
dominate
very
interesting
and
very
odd
for
a
pale
ale
overall
i
like
it
i
will
drink
it
again
it
goes
well
with
a
good
traditional
turkey
dinner
with
stuffing
sweet
potatoes
and
all
overall
a
nice
change
of
pace
i
liked
the
oak
flavoring
good
drinkability
not
hugely
complex
but
enough
in
there
to
keep
you
interested
nice
to
see
some
barrel
aging
on
a
regular
beer
thanks
cypress
carbonation
felt
slightly
harsh
on
my
tongue
but
overall
it
felt
fullbodied
and
enjoyable
not
sure
i
can
drink
45
in
a
session
but
definitely
a
nice
treat
that
ill
be
having
again
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
i
might
choose
other
pale
ales
over
it
but
would
happily
drink
it
anytime
not
bad
but
i
could
not
drink
many
at
once
really
tasty
pale
ale
ive
seen
it
on
tap
nitro
not
cask
and
that
was
a
big
disappointment
will
not
be
trying
that
again
a
cask
version
of
this
would
be
great
the
taste
is
very
reminiscent
of
whisky
and
again
vanilla
butterscotch
warming
alcohol
notes
strong
ale
after
all
and
surprisingly
a
hint
of
dill
the
aftertaste
is
all
vanilla
and
dill
i
enjoyed
this
beer
a
whole
lot
and
was
sad
to
finish
it
as
it
was
a
gift
originating
from
far
far
away
d
very
drinkable
really
enjoyed
this
beer
look
forward
to
the
next
one
the
whiskey
taste
really
makes
this
enjoyable
good
stuff
i
like
a
regular
strength
beer
with
the
barrel
aging
typically
you
only
see
8
big
beers
taking
the
barrel
aged
challenge
id
like
to
see
more
of
these
the
carbonation
is
a
little
bit
much
but
otherwise
its
a
quality
brew
id
drink
this
again
if
the
price
wasnt
so
offputting
i
paid
6something
for
one
12oz
bottle
if
the
price
was
marked
on
the
shelf
i
probaby
would
have
thought
twice
for
the
swedes
think
rotmos
mashed
turnip
as
you
drink
it
meal
in
a
drink
decent
body
with
a
smooth
mouthfeel
that
isnt
too
light
or
heavy
interesting
final
product
makes
me
wonder
what
the
nonoaked
version
in
like
if
youre
hoping
for
flavors
of
a
rauchbier
youll
be
disappointed
if
youre
expecting
a
boring
onedimensional
english
pale
ale
youll
be
pleasantly
surprised
drinkability
a
singularly
unique
beer
thats
best
enjoyed
slowly
drinkability
is
something
else
this
is
a
nice
warmer
for
a
nightcap
or
to
have
while
sitting
in
your
big
chair
with
a
good
book
and
your
favourite
background
music
not
a
session
beer
its
quite
acceptable
but
not
my
favourite
i
would
not
turn
down
a
free
one
this
is
pretty
good
stuff
but
they
could
be
a
tad
more
generous
and
give
it
to
us
in
500ml
bottles
and
preferably
not
clear
ones
a
very
pleasant
drink
and
worth
the
extra
cash
i
paid
for
it
pours
with
filtered
clarity
and
a

a

ive
had
to

but
that
isnt

a

the
flavor

makes
this
one
of
my
favorite
beer
this
is
a
very
tasty
unique
beer
i
really
enjoy
all
of
the
innis

lineup
with
this
being
the
most
straightforward
choice
the
vanilla
toffee
and
oak
promised
on
the
label
come
through
in
both
the
aroma
and
the
taste
i
sampled
this
from
a
750

bottle
which
was
quite
reasonably
priced
considering
the
quality
of
this
beer
not
a
bad
tasting
brew
wasnt
the
most
pleasant
smell
but
after
the
first
sip
it
wasnt
that
bad
you
can
definitely
taste
the
hint
of
vanilla
and
oak
quite
a
sweet

aside

this

its

i
really
have
a

this

one

beers
ever
that
i
really
liked
the
appearance

a

very

a

the
taste
is
incredibly
smooth
with
hints
of
toasted

and
a
little

still

this

i
highly

this
beer
to
anyone
who
enjoys
a

beer

it
this
is
a
pleasant
scottish
ale
not

not

grabbed
a
mixed
4
pack
of
innis
and
gunn
beers
because
well
i
am
scottish
so
what
the
hell
good
looking
beer
with
an
i
guess
interesting
smell
not
sure
what
to
make
of
it
taste
is
similar
not
exactly
what
i
expected
from
a
scotch
ale
but
tasty
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
but
not
one
i
will
revisit
regularly
due
to
cost
plenty
of
better
beers
for
less
i
was
takin
back
when
i
saw
this
i
was
at
a
trade
show
and
the
only
female
rep
that
was
their
was
the
innis
gunn
rep
so
obviously
i
went
over
and
when
i
started
trying
her
product
i
was
dumb
founded
to
day
the
least
i
tried
the
original
the
porter
the
rum
aged
and
the
canadian
chereywood
limited
edition
and
their
were
all
amazing
and
since
than
i
make
sure
to
keep
them
in
my
fridge
at
all
times
its
hard
to
get
sometimes
cause
the
distributor
doesnt
always
have
it
in
stock
but
i
say
when
your
at
your
local
liquor
store
and
you
see
anything
with
the
innis
gunn
name
on
it
buy
it
you

alcohol
is

not
an

one
i
will
seek
out
again
as
for
food
it
would
pair
with
rich
cheeses
or
even
a
spicy
barbeque
and
would
accompany
flavorful

foods
well
o

this
is
not
what
this
is
about
not
many
straight
oakaged
beers
i
can
think
of
aside
from
the
ig
deviate
from
the
norm
with
these
scottish
cask
brews
o
not
style
i
think
im
particularly
fond
of
but
certainly
an
interesting
experience
ive
not
had
a
beer
with
a
flavor
profile
like
this
before
recommended
to
try
once
at
least
if
only
it
was
in
a
darker
bottle
o
tasty
brew
that
has
a
beautiful
combination
of
flavors
original
is
righton
one
side
its
a
straightup
malt
bomb
that
is
balanced
by
some
hopping
on
the
other
side
is
its
strength
and
oak
aging
which
ends
up
being
quite
complex
a
great
pick
if
you
are
looking
for
something
outside
of
the
norm
o
i
found
this
to
be
one
of
the
more
enjoyable
beers
in
the
style
that
i
have
tried
because
it
was
not
overly
sweet
or
overly
boozy
the
flavors
of
the
oak
and
the
vanilla
were
really
nice
and
the
alcohol
was
fairly
well
hidden
i
was
happy
to
not
get
any
skunky
flavorsaromas
considering
the
beer
is
in
clear
glass
bottles
pours
a
brilliantly
clear
deep
golden
color
with
a
huge
bubbly
off
white
head
that
slowly
dissipates
to
a
cap
on
top
aromas
of
oak
tannin
and
a
hint
of
vanilla
penetrate
my
nostrils
as
soon
as
i
more
the
glass
nearer
to
my
face
earthy
almost
apple
pie
spice
with
hints
of
caramel
and
mineral
water
round
out
the
nose
little
to

flavor
is
big
on
the
fruits
apple

light
caramel
and
brown
sugar
gives

to

little
to

flavor
or
bitterness
medium
body
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
and
a
sweet
light
sugary
mouthfeel
not
a
bar
beer
per
se
but
not
something
i
really
enjoyed
much
i
love
the
appearance
it
just
looks
like
a
great
beer
the
smell
is
not
to
my
liking
and
smells
to
me
like
a
cheaper
beer
of
which
this
wasnt
that
inexpensive
almost
smells
like
pbr
the
feel
finish
of
the
beer
is
my
favorite
part
it
ends
with
a
beautiful
honey
taste
and
leaves
the
tongue
feeling
like
it
was
just
covered
in
a
thin
layer
of
honey
this
made
this
beer
very
appealing
to
me
it
may
not
sound
appealing
and
i
would
agree
but
it
actually
was
a
good
part
of
this
beer
taste
whys
i
honestly
cannot
tell
if
i
like
this
beer
it
is
a
difficult
decision
its
a
bit
of
a
heavier
beer
so
definitely
not
a
session
beer
again
the
taste
is
so
hard
to
tell
the
first
pat
of
the
sip
isnt
the
best
but
then
it
gets
sweeter
and
turns
to
honey
totally
unique
and
different
from
any
other
beer
ive
had
i
do
like
would
i
buy
it
again
maybe
hard
to
say
maybe
would
get
it
again
on
a
cold
night
where
i
just
want
to
sit
and
rest
o
this
was
surprising
to
say
the
least
sweetness
everywhere
this
seemed
really
balanced
and
had
really
strong
scents
and
flavors
but
to
me
this
was
jus
too
sweet
glad
i
had
it
but
ill
probably
never
buy
again
o
a
nice
oak
aged
beer
that
displays
the
barrels
nicely
not
to
much
in
the
way
of
the
barrel
so
it
really
shines
through
a
good
dessert
beer
because
of
the
sweetness
but
not
a
bad
anytime
beer
either
cheers
overall
i
found
this
beer
interesting
due
to
the
vanilla
flavour
im
not
sure
id
go
out
of
my
way
to
purchase
this
beer
to
bring
home
but
i
would
not
be
bothered
if
it
came
along
for
the
ride
as
part
of
a
variety
pack
it
had
a
nice
oak
flavor
to
it
but
the
problem
was
that
this
oak
flavor
was
largely
masked
by
a
distinct
toffee
taste
if
you
are
a
toffee
lover
than
this
might
be
an
amazing
beer
i
certainly
am
not
one
of
those
people
i
didnt
really
enjoy
it
and
it
was
wasnt
cheap
even
for
craft
beer
i
wont
be
buying
more
overall
i
always
like
these
beers
and
cant
wait
to
try
the
whisky
version
tasty
as
all
hell

a

original
oak
aged
beer
wont
blow
your
mind
but
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
an
affordable
nononsense
barrelaged
brew
this
is
the
old
standby
that
i
have
returned
to
again
and
again
this
canned
version
is
only
a
slight
improvement
over
the
clear
bottles
weve
been
stuck
with
previously
due
to
the
lack
of
skunking
i
can
understand
why
some
people
arent
so
big
on
this
beer
with
all
the
sweet
notes
and
relative
lack
of
hop
balance
but
i
still
have
a
soft
spot
for
this
stuff
and
most
people
i
offer
it
to
seem
fairly
satisfied
with
it
in
any
event
its
well
worth
a
try
o
the
innis
gunn
original
has
nice
barrel
aging
flavors
but
i
find
it
could
use
a
bit
more
hops
otherwise
its
an
easy
drinking
brew
with
an
abv
thats
surprisingly
well
hidden
this
is
a
nice
malty
scottish
ale
its
very
easy
to
drink
the
only
downside
to
this
beer
is
that
its
purely
malty
with
little
else
save
some
oak
for
complexity
on
the
plus
side
this
beer
didnt
have
any
of
the
skunky
character
i
actually
expected
from
a
clearbottle
import
still
its
a
compromised
product
and
it
gets
scored
as
such
because
its
totally
preventable
if
they
used
better
bottles
or
packaging
wont
be
buying
anymore
innis

till
they
fix
this
overall
great
beer
i
will
definitely
have
it
again

the

beer

same
as

easy

the
finish
is
on
the
sweet
side
a
bit
more
hop
would
make
this
quite
a
bit
more
interesting
but
as
it
is
just
an
easy
to
drink
ale
with
an
emphasis
on
sweetness
and
vanilla
oakiness
ok
but
a
one
trick
pony
i
dream
about
this
beer
seriously
it
is
an
absolutely
amazing
beverage
the
color
is
spot
on
amber
orange
the
smell
is
caramel
and
vanilla
and
malt
and
scotch
it
tastes
like
it
smells
but
the
after
taste
lingers
so
nicely
i
enjoy
the
sweetness
that
it
comes
with
as
i
am
a
fan
of
dessert
in
general
it
is
potent
you
dont
notice
the
alcohol
content
until
it
is
too
late
overall
its
not
as
good
as
i
had
originally
rated
it
but
i
contend
that
it
might
still
be
the
best
offering
in
their
lineup
definitely
something
to
enjoy
time
and
again
very
original
beer
flavorful
and
quite
refreshing
well
worth
it
a
try
o
a
fine
almost
liquid
butterscotch
candylike
treat
was
expecting
more
oak
or
whiskey
presence
from
this
oak
aged
beer
but
the
caramel
malt
won
out
over
anything
else
except
for
a
note
or
two
of
woodiness
in
the
aftertaste

winner
from

advent
calendar
outstanding
o

this
one
crept
up
on
me
food
match
did
someone
say
butterscotch
pudding
no
its
not
sweet
enough
for
that
however
it
would
match
a
nice
medieval
banquet
with
roasted
pheasant
terrine
of
game
meats
confit
of
duck
and
spiced
roasted
pig
on
a
spit
o
i
didnt
describe
this
beer
well
its
good
but
its
hard
for
me
to
tell
you
why
o
enjoyable
beer
goes
best
with
a
cold
evening
the
aroma
is
sweet
but
the
taste
is
significantly
more
bitter
with
caramel
hops
evolving
into
a
lingering
hop
finish
biting
to
a
degree
but
very
nice
not
sure
if
this
wants
to
be
a
big
beer
or
a
sessionable
beer
the
abv
should
say
big
but
the
end
result
is
a
sessionable
tasting
ale
at
a
nonsessionable
abv
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
very
drinkable
great
to
sip
on
this
is
a
good
ale
the
deep
brown
color
has
a
head
that
sticks
around
the
smell
is
malty
for
sure
with
some
hops
in
the
background
definitely
smells
sweet
big
taste
malty
and
sweet
with
the
hops
and
alcohol
taking
off
the
edge
of
the
huge
malty
character
the
alcohol
is
prevalent
in
the
middle
and
the
aftertaste
is
bitter
yet
fruity
buy
this
its
good
not
world
class
but
good
o
very
drinkable
and
i
will
certainly
buy
again
soon
in
looking
over
some
of
the
other
reviews
ill
definitely
will
be
on
the
high
end
of
this
beer2004
and
now
in
part
im
going
to
guess
that
some
drank
the
beer
too
cold
and
too
fast
as
it
changes
character
significantly
as
it
warms
or
this
beer
just
matches
my
palate
o
a
solid
ale
without
being
spectacular
o
whatever
its
meant
to
be
this
beer
nails
it
skilfully
brewed
and
recommended
even
if
its
not
my
favourite
style
not
at
all
cloying
insanely
drinkable
and
rather
on
the
light
end
of
this
particular
style
of
beer
dr
hides
its
abv
extremely
well
but
its
pricey
overall
im
unimpressed
d
lovely
sipping
beer
and
a
much
easier
drinker
than
i
had
expected
7
i
really
do
quite
like
it
but
its
no
full
curl
bring
back
the
dall
sheep
msun
from
reading
other
reviews
it
seems
the
buttery
toffee
notes
are
a
common
occurrence
with
this
beer
in
that
case
its
stood
up
well
to
the
test
of
time
a
sweeter
interpretation
of
the
style
but
decent
d
the
bitterness
of
hops
dominates
and
that
doesnt
even
have
the
hop
flavor
to
support
it
the
malt
has
some
floral
cleaner
quality
with
the
alcohol
heat
and
that
makes
this
a
bit
tough
to
get
through
drinkability
it
started
tasting
a
little
hot
after
a
while
not
something
i
want
to
drink
a
ton
of
poured
into
a
duvel
tulip
glass
this
beer
is
a
little
different
in
color
than
i
expected
it
has
the
orangeamber
glow
color
as
a
double
ipa
or
belgian
pale
ale
not
much
clarity
to
it
it
has
a
creamy
white
head
but
it
goes
away
pretty
quickly
not
much
lacing
the
smell
is
very
good
but
doesnt
really
smell
too
much
like
a
scottish
ale
hoppy
with
some
sweet
malt
flavors
and
a
little
buttery
the
taste
is
a
step
up
again
with
the
sweet
malts
caramelized
a
little
bit
of
a
butterscotch
flavor
and
a
hint
of
liquorish
flavor
in
my
opinion
grainy
taste
and
has
a
hoppy
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
very
good
full
bodied
creamy
with
a
slightly
dry
finish
from
the
hops
slight
bite
and
good
carbonation
tone
very
drinkable
havent
had
it
in
about
4
years
the
first
real
import
i
had
and
what
got
me
interested
in
trying
new
beer
even
though
ive
had
many
different
scottish
ales
in
the
past
this
one
is
certainly
different
from
the
rest
good
beer
id
recommend
anyone
to
try
it
bottle
poured
a
light
brown
color
ale
with
a
nice
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
lacing
aroma
consists
of
grain
and
cereal
with
some
dry
notes
and
limited
sweetness
taste
is
also
dominated
by
dry
cereal
with
lightly
unrefined
grain
notes
and
minimal
residual
sugars
body
is
about
average
with
good
carbonation
and
no
apparent
alcohol
a
bit
too
dry
and
grainy
for
my
taste
d
despite
some
unevenness
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
pours
a
caramel
color
with
a
big
head
and
some
good
lace
the
aroma
is
very
earthy
and
woody
with
a
distinct
oak
and
vinous
note
but
the
aroma
is
dominated
by
ripe
red
apple
the
flavor
is
nicely
earthy
and
hoppy
with
some
fruitiness
and
overall
very
dry
and
woody
this
beer
improves
quite
a
bit
as
it
warms
which
is
wild
because
i
opened
it
at
room
temperature
as
it
warms
it
gets
a
much
fruitier
character
with
some
good
caramel
maltiness
palate
is
nicely
full
tasty
d
excellent
scottish
malt
profile
which
is
not
overdone
with
a
clean
refreshing
hop
note
in
the
finish
abv
dangerously
hidden
delicious
the
beer
pours
a
murky
orangishbrown
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
sweet
fruit
with
some
caramel
malts
the
flavor
is
very
sweet
with
some
caramel
and
toffee
malt
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
mediumcolored
and
slightly
foggy
with
a
deep
head
somewhat
offwhite
and
largebubbled
almost
like
icedtea
with
a
rootbeerfloat
head
from
the
first
sniff
i
could
tell
this
would
be
a
good
scottish
ale
it
has
plenty
of
malt
in
the
aroma
with
a
teeny
bit
of
a
sting
from
hops
perhaps
a
little
bit
sour
as
well
some
caramel
and
even
a
little
ww
bread
is
present
as
well
the
body
is
not
too
dense
but
theres
a
enough
resistance
that
it
doesnt
feel
all
that
thin
low
carbonation
makes
it
feel
a
little
heavy
as
well
caramel
and
lightly
smokey
malt
predominate
in
the
taste
i
could
have
had
five
of
these
except
at
7
abv
id
be
wobbling
across
the
kitchen
in
no
time
a
pint
was
enough
for
this
evening
but
ill
be
buying
more
d
overall
a
nice
scotch
style
ale
good
on
a
cold
winters
day
the
best
part
about
this
style
is
that
its
usually
very
accessible
to
a
newcomer
this
is
a
good
example
that
offers
an
emphasis
on
malt
that
is
typical
for
the
style
certainly
worth
checking
this
out
if
youre
a
fan
of
the
style
on
the
palate
this
is
coarse
with
lots
of
co2
however
this
leaves
the
palate
wet
and
warm
a
little
heavy
but
rather
drinkable
nonetheless
overall
a
good
representation
of
the
style
though
perhaps
the
bottle
had
a
little
too
much
age
on
it
leading
to
a
level
of
carbonation
a
bit
too
low
still
an
enjoyable
start
to
a
very
enjoyable
evening
of
goodbeer
imbibing
dark
amber
brown
liquid
decent
lacing
the
nose
is
sweet
and
a
tad
simple
its
good
but
its
a
fairly
plain
caramelized
malt
scent
the
flavor
is
really
nice
im
not
a
big
fan
of
scottish
ales
but
this
is
an
enjoyable
beer
its
not
too
sweet
or
too
syrupy
but
its
still
strong
and
rich
the
flavor
reminds
of
a
doppelbock
which
i
mean
as
a
compliment
the
feel
is
smooth
and
fairly
creamy
with
only
prickling
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
drinkability
is
good
for
me
particularly
compared
to
sweeter
versions
of
the
style
just
arrived
at
the
store
today
therefore
i
had
to
give
it
a
try
the
beer
pours
a
dark
amber
with
a
fingerthick
offwhite
head
that
settles
to
a
fine
film
on
the
top
lacing
is
nice
but
has
a
bit
of
a
soap
suds
look
to
it
the
nose
is
sweet
with
a
nutty
character
and
hints
of
caramel
the
flavors
of
this
brew
are
better
than
the
nose
it
starts
nutty
with
caramel
and
brown
sugar
but
finishes
pleasantly
dry
this
beer
is
full
bodied
and
yet
does
not
overwhelm
the
palate
its
a
solid
brew
and
definitely
worth
trying
the
taste
is
raisiny
and
fruity
with
a
hint
of
rum
caramel
leafy
and
ctirsuy
a
mostly
fruitygrainy
raisiny
sweetness
with
light
hoppy
bitterness
taking
over
in
the
end
along
with
hints
of
bitter
chocolate
and
coffee
really
cool
appearance
and
a
biting
nose
strong
full
distinctive
flavor
solid
feel
really
good
quaff
drinks
pretty
easy
this
drinks
more
like
an
american
strong
ale
imo
still
a
nice
one
to
sip
one
cool
december
evening
it
pours
rich
and
brown
with
hints
of
amber
the
bottle
was
a
bit
pricey
but
well
worth
it
i
dont
know
of
many
places
around
here
that
serve
this
beer
but
any
time
i
see
it
be
sure
i
will
become
a
regular
at
that
bar
drinks
easy
enough
overall
a
decent
beer
nothing
fantastic
but
solid
500ml
brown
bottle
from
lighthouse
in
manchester
pours
a
hazy
copper
body
with
a
half
inch
of
slowly
dissipating
offwhite
head
smells
sweet
bready
and
buttery
tastes
sweet
toasty
grassy
buttery
with
caramel
brown
sugar
and
bready
notes
medium
to
full
in
body
with
moderate
carbonation
fairly
drinkable
for
the
style
a
tasty
solid
one
for
sure
not
too
much
wrong
here
pours
a
nice
dark
ambercopper
color
with
good
head
a
lot
of
initial
carbonation
and
a
bit
of
lacing
nice
scent
very
deep
more
smoke
with
less
peat
and
a
lot
of
malt
mixture
of
tastes
theres
a
definite
maltiness
a
deep
smokey
flavor
a
burst
of
sweetness
as
a
milk
stout
followed
by
more
smoke
and
a
not
very
well
covered
alcohol
hit
it
does
go
down
fairly
smooth
for
a
higher
abv
brew
though
drinkability
here
is
good
ill
be
getting
some
more
of
these
and
its
worth
a
try
the
whole
beer
makes
me
feel
like
it
was
crossed
between
two
styles
wee
heavy
and
scotch
ale
drinkability
seems
just
a
tad
lower
than
everything
else
as
its
got
a
roughness
that
edges
out
the
milder
elements
and
that
hop
bitterness
is
strong
for
the
style
its
almost
like
a
scottish
aleipa
hybrid
no
matter
its
plenty
enjoyable
and
i
wouldnt
think
twice
about
picking
it
up
again
opinion
this
is
a
pretty
decent
beer
overall
i
wouldnt
call
it
a
strong
scotch
ale
by
any
means
but
it
may
classify
as
some
sort
of
wee
heavy
or
some
such
i
expect
these
beers
to
be
more
of
a
dessertlike
experience
but
this
one
starts
to
walk
the
line
to
the
south
and
come
in
like
a
bitter
anyway
it
is
a
decent
beer
to
drink
tasted
on
12708
drinkability
was
solid
due
to
the
unique
rich
combination
of
flavors
that
really
hit
home
in
addition
the
7
abv
is
pretty
wellmasked
behind
an
intricate
combination
of
wonderful
flavors
recommended
ill
be
done
with
this
500ml
in
a
heartbeat
it
was
a
real
pleasure
to
drink
the
beer
pours
a
murky
brown
caramel
color
into
my
snifter
with
visible
yeast
and
a
short
head
caramel
berries
and
smoked
wood
appear
to
be
the
flavors
of
the
day
in
this
beer
cabonation
is
extremely
light
though
it
could
be
a
sign
that
the
bottle
i
got
was
old
not
bad
overall
but
its
likely
better
fresh
this
is
one
of
the
more
powerful
scottish
ales
ive
had
not
to
be
confused
with
a
scotch
ale
and
it
does
a
nice
job
of
blending
the
rich
malts
and
caramel
character
with
a
nice
subtle
dose
of
english
hops
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
inviting
and
the
mouthfeel
is
delightfully
smooth
and
full
the
alcohol
is
masked
to
the
point
where
its
undetectable
impressive
considering
this
is
7
overall
a
very
nice
job
could
hardly
believe
this
was
7
from
the
bottle
i
had
nice
drinkable
and
enjoyable
i
might
want
a
bit
more
malt
or
smokiness
in
my
scottish
ales
but
this
one
was
still
quite
enjoyable
thanks
to
bruskiator
for
letting
me
try
this
one
lots
of
smoke
lighter
color
than
expected
nice
tan
head
burnt
roasted
malts
noticeable
in
the
taste
and
smell
lots
of
maltiness
peat
not
one
of
my
favorites
of
this
style
a
bit
hard
to
finish
a
pint
this
beer
poured
a
cloudy
brownburnt
orange
color
it
had
a
big
rocky
head
which
quickly
dissipated
the
smell
is
malty
with
caramel
and
smoke
aromas
present
the
taste
is
mostly
of
malt
there
are
some
hints
of
bitterness
and
slight
smoke
as
well
the
mouthfeel
is
full
and
seems
quite
appropriate
overall
this
is
a
nice
flavorful
brew
that
id
consider
solid
best
before
date
of
nov
2007
pours
into
my
tall
starfleet
academy
pilsner
glass
a
deep
very
old
dirty
penny
color
with
minimal
bubbles
at
best
got
a
strange
amount
of
floating
sediment
throughout
the
glassnot
a
bad
thingjust
was
not
expecting
it
smells
like
a
brown
belgian
to
me
ripe
fruitiness
seems
to
overpower
the
maltiness
that
i
was
expecting
from
a
ale
from
scotland
the
carbonation
is
on
the
lighter
end
and
the
taste
was
close
to
what
i
smell
it
tastes
like
a
light
brown
belgian
with
the
minimal
malting
i
wanted
from
the
champion
beer
of
scotland
2002
if
i
drank
this
at
a
blind
taste
test
i
would
have
never
guessed
a
scottish
ale
it
is
very
drinkable
and
smooth
after
it
warms
a
bit
the
7
gives
it
just
a
little
bit
more
warming
character
that
is
ver
pleasant
d
good
drinkability
this
is
a
very
nice
scotch
ale
it
pours
a
deep
reddish
amber
plenty
enough
cloudy
with
a
good
head
good
lacing
and
very
moderate
carbonation
the
smell
is
sweet
malts
a
little
whisky
burnt
sugar
and
some
other
floral
sweetness
the
taste
is
full
bodied
brown
sugar
sweet
whisky
burnt
malts
perhaps
a
little
burnt
straw
too
maybe
some
molasses
with
a
raisiny
flavor
although
this
beer
has
loads
of
malts
there
is
some
hoppy
balance
too
the
aftertaste
is
not
cloying
sweetness
but
it
is
a
warming
alcohol
on
the
tongue
the
mouth
feel
is
a
bit
heavy
and
you
would
think
this
beer
closer
to
10
abv
with
its
heaviness
and
alcohol
in
the
aftertaste
if
you
like
the
burnt
sugary
malt
flavors
of
a
scotch
ale
then
you
will
like
this
ale
it
doesnt
have
as
much
of
the
burnt
flavor
as
other
scotch
ales
ive
tasted
and
it
is
a
little
sweeter
but
it
is
still
a
nice
representation
of
the
style
lchaim
d
it
a
bit
on
the
heavy
side
but
taking
that
into
account
i
can
envision
drinking
more
of
this
if
only
i
could
find
more
of
it
md
as
this
is
an
unfiltered
ale
judging
from
the
sediments
left
in
the
bottle
the
mouthfeel
is
really
fresh
and
soft
not
fizzy
or
artificial
at
all
despite
its
alc
strength
the
tremendous
hop
bitterness
and
burnt
flavour
both
render
it
a
moreish
and
quaffable
drink
the
flavour
doesnt
boast
as
much
toffee
and
peatsmokeness
as
many
of
its
counterparts
but
the
end
result
is
all
the
same
solid
and
delicious
a
lovely
crossing
bw
esb
and
scottish
ale
one
of
the
better
scottish
ales
ive
had
this
almost
borders
on
a
wee
heavy
but
is
still
light
enough
to
be
drinkable
but
not
heavy
new
to
bc
this
is
another
great
scot
beer
that
really
puts
forth
the
malty
goodness
an
opaque
dark
brown
with
a
fine
head
this
beer
has
nose
full
of
quality
malt
and
brown
sugar
the
beer
packs
a
punch
with
big
notes
on
the
front
and
back
the
balance
is
there
but
i
love
the
bigness
of
the
beer
most
definitely
worth
a
purchase
if
you
can
find
it
pours
out
of
the
half
litre
bottle
a
cloudy
amber
colour
thin
fine
head
with
little
lacing
malty
aroma
choco
caramel
figs
some
plum
and
prunes
too
some
floral
hoppiness
too
all
of
it
subdued
but
very
nice
interesting
flavours
in
the
taste
profile
the
first
thing
i
notice
is
how
heavily
hopped
this
scottish
ale
is
very
surprising
is
the
bitterness
there
are
some
smokyburnt
notes
alcohol
pepperiness
and
some
carameltoffee
undertones
kind
of
scattered
and
not
really
well
balanced
the
body
is
medium
and
the
mouthfeel
seems
thinnish
for
the
style
lingering
bitterness
in
the
finish
drinkability
suffers
for
the
fact
that
its
just
not
a
well
balanced
scottish
ale
and
its
way
over
hopped
for
the
style
cool
looking
label
with
the
mad
looking
friar
cooking
up
a
batch
of
brew
very
scottish
take
on
a
doppelbock
type
brew
a
little
onesided
and
overly
sweet
but
that
gives
it
points
for
truth
to
style
i
tend
towards
the
darker
side
of
scottish
ales
but
this
one
is
a
good
counterpoint
to
a
british
extra
strong
bitter
depends
on
your
fancy
notes
i
was
surprised
by
this
brew
as
it
was
pretty
bold
compared
to
those
ive
tried
in
this
style
if
the
malt
bill
had
a
bit
more
complexity
this
would
be
a
staple
in
the
fridge
for
now
its
a
purchase
when
i
see
it
im
on
a
roll
tonight
2
great
beers

brew
wish
i
had
more
while
not
a
session
beer
due
to
the
alcohol
it
is
quite
drinkable
and
nicely
warming
overall
this
brew
is
different
from
any
i
have
had
extremely
malty
and
fullbodied
not
something
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
again
but
it
was
definitely
worth
the
try
a
very
nice
example
of
the
genre
would
certainly
recommend
it
and
will
make
sure
to
have
a
couple
bottles
around
for
those
saturdays
in
listening
to
smooth
jazz
while
relaxing
in
that
old
sweatshirt
check
it
our
chill
out
overall
a
very
enjoyable
scotch
ale
rich
and
malty
with
a
nice
hop
balance
alcohol
really
kicks
in
the
backend
and
reinforces
that
this
is
a
sipping
beer
very
nice
this
is
really
good
its
too
bad
it
was
kind
of
expensive
4
75
still
i
could
see
this
when
in
the
mood
for
something
different
a
coppery
luminescent
amber
ochre
hue
greets
me
with
a
slight
offwhite
mild
bubbling
and
a
through
and
through
head
the
aroma
is
a
strong
malt
not
overpowering
or
gfake
smelling
good
toasty
malts
make
me
think
of
baking
bread
or
coffee
cake
the
taste
is
nice
and
smokey
in
the
front
very
evident
i
like
the
tosty
middle
like
sweet
tea
biscuits
the
fifnish
is
just
smooth
malted
grains
the
palate
is
sweet
smooth
and
chock
full
o
malty
goodness
a
little
burn
felt
in
the
front
of
the
tongue
too
nice
scottish
ale
pours
lightlysedimented
dull
copper
after
a
very
careful
decanting
no
head
and
sparse
lace
smells
of
rich
and
slightly
smoky
caramel
malts
with
a
strong
and
spicy
alcohol
base
heavy
with
complex
flavors
nuts
and
caramel
lead
the
way
but
are
balanced
with
earthy
and
leafy
yeast
notes
finish
is
laced
with
peppery
dark
fruit
alcohols
oily
and
syrupy
thick
body
with
minimal
carbonation
a
nice
highershilling
ale
with
wellhidden
alcohol
as
with
any
good
scottish
ale
the
emphasis
is
definitely
on
the
malt
but
not
to
the
point
of
excess
or
total
lack
of

great
complexity
and
smooth

clean
coppery
brown
beer
has
a
small
creamy
beige
head
a
nice
aroma
of
dried
fruit
figs
and
raisins
and
a
hint
of
chocolate
with
a
strong
threat
of
alcohol
in
the
background
a
light
sweet
caramel
and
dried
fruit
note
runs
over
your
tongue
quickly
followed
by
the
alcohol
and
a
bitter
tabaccco
like
finish
ill
have
to
check
other
reviews
to
see
if
this
is
a
common
thing
rich
fruit
notes
greet
my
taste
buds
from
the
get
go
sweet
concentrated
notes
of
plum
move
to
full
on
prune
as
well
as
enticing
notes
of
fig
the
beer
finishes
with
rum
like
notes
of
alcohol
and
sweet
yet
fermented
molasses
something
here
definitely
reminds
me
of
a
sticky
yet
fully
caramelized
sticky
bun
i
also
cant
help
but
think
a
dark
darker
than
i
have
ever
had
brown
sugar
while
the
malt
notes
are
rich
and
concentrated
this
beer
still
manages
to
finish
a
bit
on
the
thin
side
though
only
at
times
a
touch
of
roasted
slightly
burnt
flavors
add
a
touch
of
balance
and
even
bitterness
to
the
finish
of
this
beer
comments
not
my
favorite
of
the
style
too
thick
cloying
the
alcohol
notes
are
overly
present
pours
dark
burnt
orange
not
so
cloudy
and
a
nice
hue
good
carbonation
bubbly
effervescent
head
with
some
decent
lacing
as
well
smells
of
a
nice
blend
of
malts
with
coffee
caramels
smokiness
taste
follows
suit
good
flavors
and
the
blend
is
nice
and
easy
smooth
transitions
of
flavor
with
maltiness
sweetness
and
smokiness
that
pleases
the
palate
i
would
definitely
have
this
one
again
blackfriar
scottish
ale
pours
a
hazy
dark
orange
with
an
off
white
fluffy
head
the
aroma
really
gets
me
just
a
great
smelling
beer
malty
and
even
citrusy
smell
any
beer
that
smells
this
good
is
likely
to
taste
good
too
so
here
goes
mmm
this
is
excellent
everything
i
like
in
a
beer
strong
bold
flavors
that
balance
well
with
each
other
strong
malt
flavor
but
balanced
with
hops
that
assert
themselves
at
the
right
time
and
in
the
right
amount
an
excellent
beer
drinkability
is
good
a
great
sipping
brew
that
warms
your
body
and
soul
not
your
average
scottish
ale
it
is
different
but
sometimes
thats
a
good
thing
drinkability
a
most
intriguing
but
unusual
beer
the
lack
of
hops
on
the
nose
leads
to
a
total
surprise
when
they
kick
in
on
the
finish
this
scottish
ale
is
a
great
sipper
thats
best
enjoyed
slow
and
not
over
chilled
scottish
malty
goodness
is
what
i
find
in
this
amber
to
light
brown
ale
this
ale
has
a
wonderful
biscuitlike
aroma
it
smells
like
my
homebrewery
does
while
im
mashing
the
grain
the
head
falls
to
about
an
eighthinch
collar
of
foam
enhancing
the
appearance
the
body
is
full
which
to
me
is
an
important
quality
in
a
stronger
scottish
ale
the
brew
is
all
about
the
cookie
or
biscuitlike
malt
flavors
mixed
with
a
nutty
character
and
a
touch
too
much
bitterness
for
the
style
but
im
guessing
some
of
that
might
come
from
amber
or
roasted
malts
despite
some
style
issues
and
possible
overhopping
this
is
a
damn
fine
ale
mellowed
scotch
taste
nice
colour
some
scotch
aroma
my
mates
liked
it
a
bit
but

much

minor
notes
of

in
the
glass
aroma
of
hops
and
roasted

with
some
sweetness
also
for
some
reason
this
beer
made
me
think
of
an
ipa
like
there
was
a
hidden
hop
somewhere
in
the
mix
taste
is
solid
flavors
of
hops
caramel
wood
and
toasted
malt
go
amazing
well
together
mouthfeel
was
kind
of
syrupy
and
thick
but
still
very
palateable
drinkability
is
fair
i
probably
wouldnt
drink
this
everyday
but
when
i
was
in
the
mood
for
a
scotch
ale
this
would
be
it
very
good
beer
for
sure
i
would
try
again
quite
deeply
red
in
color
scummy
lace
toasty
aromas
of
moist
malty
bread
and
nuts
with
links
to
roasted
herbs
cherry
and
redcurrant
jam
fruits
mount
on
the
first
drink
bitter
burnt
sugars
can
be
compared
to
italian
nougat
or
scottish
toffee
tangy
brown
spices
and
parroasted
coffee
beans
join
with
seasoned
hardwood
and
nutshells
a
mouthful
is
big
and
round
without
any
sense
of
syrupy
malt
rooted
tarry
bitterness
muscles
fragrant
fruits
and
spices
beautifully
dry
and
poundable
the
beer
pours
a
ruby
red
color
with
a
thick
creamy
offwhite
head
that
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
rich
malty
scent
that
boasts
of
pale
crystal
and
roasted
malts
it
is
sweet
yet
dry
the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
warm
roasted
malt
flavor
that
is
slightly
sweet
with
crystal
malts
and
dry
on
the
finish
it
has
an
elevated
abv
but
its
well
hidden
the
malt
bill
is
not
that
complex
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
mediumfull
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
good
drinking
beer
it
has
good
flavor
and
nice
warm
feel
the
color
is
dark
copper
with
an
averagesized
light
brown
head
the
aroma
is
of
dark
earthy
malts
with
a
strong
dark
fruit
smell
a
sip
has
an
initial
dark
fruit
bite
that
melds
into
dark
earthy
malts
a
light
sugary
sweetness
is
noticed
in
the
finish
a
touch
of
hops
balances
this
out
and
adds
another
layer
of
flavor
drinkability
and
mouthfeel
are
very
good
strong
scores
across
the
board
here
recommended
if
i
reset
my
expectations
and
my
palate
and
think
of
this
as
a
pale
ale
brewed
by
scots
and
not
as
a
scottish
ale
granting
scores
becomes
much
easier
lia
fail
its
lower
abv
brother
is
better
beer
in
my
opinion
you
wont
be
sorry
you
bought
blackfriar
just
keep
an
open
mind
when
you
open
the
bottle
drinkability

aftertaste
takes
the
drinkability
down
a
bit
since
it
carries
the
strong
bitterness
into
the
next
experience
the
initial
smoothness
helps
the
cause
i
think
you
will
be
pleased
with
this
brew
if
you
normally
like
scottish
ale
this
liquid
is
a
hazy
brown
with
a
lightly
reddish
hue
and
a
thick
creamcolored
head
its
aroma
is
appropriately
sweet
and
malty
with
a
doughy
breaklike
quality
and
a
roastedsmokey
undertone
its
a
pleasing
wellpositioned
smell
that
starts
the
beer
off
right
theres
also
a
little
alcohol
in
the
smell
which
transfers
over
into
the
taste
the
beer
is
relatively
sweet
with
a
big
bitterness
running
through
it
the
finish
is
particularly
bitter
with
some
hop
flavor
as
well
its
a
simple
wellmade
satisfying
beer
its
hazy
darkchestnut
body
has
a
deep
ruby
cast
and
reveals
glowing
crimson
highlights
beneath
its
frothy
head
of
tan
the
head
retention
is
quite
good
especially
considering
its
alcohol
content
and
it
leaves
some
very
nice
spots
and
splashes
of
lace
about
the
pint
smooth
and
mildly
creamy
across
the
palate
its
very
fine
and
natural
carbonation
helps
to
enhance
its
maltiness
its
firm
bitterness
however
is
wide
and
unyielding
anchoring
it
and
leading
to
a
drying
semisweet
and
bitter
finish
that
lingers
with
notes
of
burnt
caramel
floral
grassy
and
leafy
hops
swirl
hereandthere
throughout
its
deeply
caramel
accented
toffeeish
toasty
nutty
slightly
candysweet
and
subtly
roasty
maltiness
bringing
it
to
life
and
lending
it
a
delicate
charm
that
leaves
it
amazingly
drinkable
its
not
overly
complex
but
the
interplay
between
the
hops
and
the
rich
maltiness
is
exquisite
finally
fruity
notes
from
the
yeast
surface
almost
immediately
as
it
warms
and
lend
another
level
to
its
character
leaving
it
as
an
almost
perfect
session
ale
and
the
only
thing
that
hinders
that
is
its
alcohol
content
of
7
which
is
entirely
cloaked
throughout
the
first
serving
at
the
very
least
impressive
this
came
in
a
500ml
bottle
pours
out
a
fairly
hazy
deep
amber
color
with
about
one
inch
of
tan
foamy
head
forming
on
top
the
head
dropped
quickly
but
left
thick
rings
of
lace
around
the
glass
malty
sweetness
in
the
aroma
with
fruits
and
chocolate
being
most
dominate
also
in
the
nose
was
a
nice
smokiness
that
mixed
well
with
the
sweetness
but
overall
the
aroma
was
a
bit
mild
taste
starts
of
with
a
big
fruity
sweetness
that
is
mixed
with
a
bit
of
caramel
and
chocolate
the
smokiness
is
quite
noticeable
in
the
taste
as
well
mouthfeel
was
a
little
lighter
than
expected
pretty
drinkable
stuff
here
with
the
nice
mix
of
flavors
pretty
solid
beer
that
i
would
definitely
pick
up
again
the
body
is
a
clear
medium
reddish
brown
the
head
is
thick
dense
and
lasting
its
an
attractive
beer
the
aroma
is
slightly
spicy
hops
cakelike
malt
and
a
bit
of
apple
the
flavor
is
very
low
in
bitterness
as
it
should
for
the
style
with
an
apple
peel
flavor
that
sets
off
the
mellow
malt
nicely
this
is
extremely
drinkable
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
quite
malty
and
dry
but
very
hoppy
as
well
with
notes
of
various
dark
fruits
pine
toasted
malts
and
deep
caramel
odd
this
brew
is
a
somewhat
hazy
brownorange
color
with
a
tiny
white
head
the
scent
is
mainly
caramel
malt
with
some
citrus
aspects
from
the
hops
bitter
hop
whack
when
the
brew
hits
the
tounge
slight
alcohol
flavor
some
spicepepper
taste
mild
malts
medium
bodied
pretty
good
overall
but
im
not
left
craving
another
one
drinkability
was
quite
high
would
be
better
if
the
smell
taste
were
more
pronounced
still
a
good
beer

only
smooth

drinkability
wow
what
can
i
say
a
beautifully
crafted
scottish
ale
this
beer
makes
me
want
to
don
my
tartan
pick
up
some
bagpipes
and
wander
from
glen
to
glen
on
a
brilliantly
sunny
fall
day
declaring
the
joy
and
pleasure
of
this
ale
small
wonder
it
won
best
beer
of
scotland
in
2002
aye
summun
haand
me
unotha
but
be
careful
the
abv
is
7
very
clear
chestnut
in
color
with
a
thin
light
tan
head
not
much
of
an
aroma
at
first
but
as
with
most
examples
of
this
style
the
toasted
malt
comes
through
more
strongly
as
the
beer
warms
full
mouthfeel
with
hints
of
diactyl
and
a
big
malt
profile
a
bit
rough
in
the
finish
but
overall
pretty
satisfying
i
found
this
beer
very
easy
to
drink
and
liked
it
a
lot
couldnt
really
detect
the
alcohol
but
give
me
4
or
5
and
i
am
sure
i
would
be
buzzed
the
colour
of
dark
tea
however
this
brand
of
tea
produces
a
pretty
big
head
which
is
tan
funk
and
caramel
are
the
odors
it
represents
tastes
smooth
big
full
and
soft
on
the
palate
there
are
notes
of
molasses
present
a
bit
tart
on
the
finish
quite
the
good
drinking
big
beer
clear
ruby
topped
by
a
rocky
off
white
head
with
respectable
retention
lace
remains
soft
esters
of
a
red
apple
nature
along
with
mellow
notes
of
carob
and
dark
toffee
are
prevalent
in
aroma
trace
floral
hop
and
butterscotch
hints
well
rounded
and
understated
aromawise
in
flavor
the
dominant
malt
impression
is
of
molasses
sweetened
whole
grain
biscuit
diacetyl
undertone
adds
an
agreeable
richness
complementary
to
the
static
mild
caramel
malt
presence
hints
of
roasted
barley
along
with
the
light
hop
bitterness
facilitate
a
transient
drying
sensation
which
is
superceded
by
an
agreeable
surge
of
buttery
dark
chocolate
and
nutty
brittle
mid
palate
a
touch
too
light
in
body
to
match
malt
character
but
dangerously
drinkable
as
a
result
finishes
mostly
clean
with
hints
of
treacle
and
woody
hops
fleeting
quickly
quite
a
tasty
and
well
crafted
brew
thats
intermediate
in
character
between
an
80
shilling
and
wee
heavy
superbly
drinkable
and
soft
on
the
palate
very
tasty
drinkability
notes
close
to
a
meal
in
a
bottle

a
malt
lovers
brew
the
taste
was
of
complex
malts
and
a
niticeable
alcohol
aftertaste
exactly
what
a
good
scotch
ale
should
be
it
was
a
little
too
strong
on
the
alcohol
for
me
i
prefer
it
to
be
masked
by
the
other
flavors
still
a
good
beer
overall
the
body
was
a
little
thin
for
me
i
was
hoping
to
have
a
thicker
smoother
drinking
beer
from
this
one
but
it
was
a
little
light
and
bubbly
going
down
clearish
red
caramel
brown
color
small
compact
beige
head
lifts
slowly
up
then
back
down
to

in

spots

lots
of

hops
help
finish
it
off
with
a
leafy
and
dried
variant
thats
biting
more
so
in

then
with
bitterness
keeps
its
toasty
edge
fairly
long
and
even
later
smaller
efforts
of
the
caramel
make
their
way
through
too
a
long
holding
finish
feel
starts
out
light
and
smooth
with
a
gradual
building
base
of
malts
and
toast
and
a
eager
little
finish
with
a
good
lasting
quality
that
was
the
clincher
for
me
into
liking
it
but
it
could
have
a
bolder
richer
body
throughout
it
really
only
has
a
strong
hold
towards
the
finish
and
within
the
finish
still
enjoyable
enough
for
a
scotch
ale
i
have
to
keep
reminding
myself
its
not
a
wee
heavy
scotch
which
i
like
much
more
then
these
regular
ones

the

real
nice
taste
is
more
malt
tilted
wich
i
expected
nice
and
fruity
with
a
light
hop
bitterness
that
comes
thru
more
as
it
warms
along
with
a
light
earthiness
seems
to
be
a
tad
watery
but
really
drinkable
for
the
alcohol
contenta
nice
find
500ml
bottle
poured
a
dark
amber
with
a
moderate
head
that
very
quickly
fades
leaving
very
little
lacing
behind
aroma
of
malt
and
hops
and
very
little
else
taste
is
caramel
and
malt
with
the
hop
twang
that
is
kind
of
overpowering
for
style
mouthfeel
is
moderate
carbonation
and
smooth
as
a
stand
alone
it
is
a
very
good
beer
and
fairly
well
balanced
but
to
me
not
really
like
the
style
pours
into
my
nonik
glass
which
is
the
perfect
size
for
500
ml
of
beer
and
a
nice
sized
head
a
burnt
sienna
colored
brew
very
nice
looking
the
white
head
stays
pretty
well
for
a
while
but
then
all
but
disappears
caramel
malt
and
sweet
orange
citrus
in
the
aroma
along
with
a
toasted
character
hop
crispness
is
everpresent
as
well
caramel
and
lots
of
grain
on
the
tongue
plenty
of
crisp
hop
bite
too
hints
of
peat
are
noticeable
here
and
there
hops
are
of
rindlike
character
and
they
come
out
a
bit
more
than
the
malt
in
most
places
making
for
a
very
crisp
brew
all
around
this
kind
of
hopping
you
dont
find
often
outside
of
the
states
a
very
enjoyable
beer
but
id
pick
belhavens
over
this
one
for
the
style
out
of
what
ive
had
we
dont
get
many
scottish
ales
here
in
arizona
or
scotch
ales
for
that
matter
much
to
my
chagrin
actually
this
is
almost
more
like
an
esb
disregarding
that
a
pleasure
to
drink
recommended
the
beer
debouches
from
the
500ml
bottle
an
unclouded
burnished
copper
color
with
a
planetary
size
head
that
is
creamy
in
texture
the
color
a
light
tan
as
it
evaporates
and
the
lace
forms
a
sticky
and
clinging
sheet
upon
the
glass
malt
dominates
the
nose
sweet
crisp
and
fresh
hints
of
caramel
a
tad
earthy
and
the
start
nicely
malted
somewhat
sweet
top
is
fair
to
middling
in
its
feel
to
the
palate
finish
is
brisk
in
its
acidity
the
hops
forceful
in
their
spiciness
very
dry
aftertaste
that
lingers
long
on
the
palate
a
quite
nice
scottish
ale
part
of
me
wanted
something
fuller
and
thicker
for
it
feels
a
bit
mild
in
texture
and
body
at
times
resulting
in
easy
drinkability
for
sure
part
of
me
too
is
just
pleased
aspunch
by
this
beer
as
it
is
though
for
5
per
500ml
bottle
i
do
feel
that
i
over
paid
on
this
item
and
probably
wont
go
back
for
more
a
winner
similar
yet
very
different
that
i
had
expected
but
it
still
covers
the
required
topics
the
extra
hopping
is
merely
a
bonus
find
it
if
you
can
and
buy
a
few
new
to
my
local
beer
store
comes
in
a
550ml
bottle
pours
a
beautiful
shiny
coppery
brown
color
a
small
head
that
leaves
incredible
lace
the
taste
is
immediately
dry
but
goes
away
the
finish
is
dry
but
just
right
taste
is
malty
but
a
little
more
hops
comes
through
than
some
other
scottish
ales
i
have
triednot
that
many
this
is
a
good
beer
worth
trying
no
matter
what
your
tastes
o
i
enjoyed
this
a
well
put
together
scottish
ale
with
some
nice
flavors
beer
is
medium
bodied
with
mediumlow
to
low
carbonation
resulting
in
a
slightly
foamy
13
and
mostly
smooth
23
mouthfeel
that
is
appropriate
for
the
beer
and
the
style
closes
dryly
with
significant
dryness
and
stickiness
on
the
palate
and
lips
food
match
in
the
words
of
the
wise
carl
weathers
whoa
whoa
whoa
theres
still
plenty
of
meat
on
that
bone
now
you
take
this
home
throw
it
in
a
pot
add
some
broth
a
potato
baby
youve
got
a
stew
going
in
other
words
stew
overall
i
certainly
like
this
one
even
if
it
doesnt
do
anything
highly
original
in
the
end
its
just
a
very
solid
scottish
ale
with
strong
bitterness
and
a
nice
balance
like
the
cask
version
it
had
a
clear
mahogany
body
with
an
offwhite
head
the
nose
a
nutty
semisweet
malty
feel
to
it
the
taste
was
malts
all
the
way
chocolate
and
toffee
being
the
strongest
flavours
within
the
maltiness
dryness
with
a
pronounced
bitterness
comes
later
with
the
hops
showing
their
worth
as
initial
maltiness
drifts
away
the
cask
review
is
just
pipped
at
the
post
by
the
overall
niceness
of
it
being
christmas
overall
well
made
delicately
flavoured
sessionable
scottish
ale
this
scottish
ale
delivers
enough
flavor
and
punch
to
win
over
the
most
enthusiastic
scotch
whiskey
fan
but
light
and
drinkable
enough
to
caress
the
palate
of
their
opposition
as
well
not
bad
stuff
a
really
nice
beer
near
dark
amber
colour
a
light
aroma
with
vague
hints
of
of
the
taste
character
a
thin
off
white
head
and
stable
body
quite
bitter
to
the
taste
with
a
coffee
finish
but
still
very
flavoursome
this
is
to
my
view
a
beautiful
beer
more
often
than
not
this
will
be
in
my
selection
if
i
am
on
a
scottish
ale
run
if
you
see
it
give
it
a
shot
o
a
very
sessionable
ale
that
is
recommended
my
nephew
hooked
me
up
with
this
beer
following
a
trip
to
scotland
clear
copperamber
pour
with
two
finger
head
with
great
retention
and
lacing
earthy
malty
nose
with
hints
of
toffee
tea
caramel
brown
sugar
and
just
a
touch
of
metal
the
hops
that
were
predominantly
absent
from
the
nose
really
jump
out
in
the
taste
in
that
classic
english
fashion
toasty
malt
brown
bread
tea
caramel
and
just
a
touch
of
vanilla
round
out
this
well
balanced
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
with
a
nice
tangy
bitter
hop
bite
on
the
finish
this
coupled
with
the
low
abv
make
this
highly
drinkable
a
very
solid
scottish
ale
thanks
kevin
o
maybe
i
tried
this
beer
at
the
wrong
time
or
maybe
i
was
just
burned
out
on
scottish
ales
but
this
ale
did
absolutely
nothing
for
me
this
is
unusual
as
i
generally
like
inveralmonds
products
i
have
a
feeling
ill
be
revisiting
this
beer
in
the
future
though
i
will
not
making
a
point
of
rushing
to
do
so
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
nice
amberish
copper
color
with
a
foamy
looking
white
head
on
top
the
smell
of
the
beer
gives
off
a
nice
soft
earthy
aroma
with
a
subtle
sweet
malts
and
grains
on
the
nose
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
sweet
with
some
subtle
hints
of
caramel
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
is
smooth
and
lightly
carbonated
overall
this
beer
is
pretty
good
i
would
try
this
one
again
someday
if
i
came
across
it
a
nice
well
balanced
scottish
ale
to
enjoy
as
session
beer
a
dark
amberbrown
colour
with
a
thick
head
with
a
very
foamy
texture
smells
a
bit
metallic
along
with
hops
some
chocolate
there
too
taste
of
aromatic
hops
with
a
malty
taste
to
back
it
up
the
malt
and
the
hops
kind
of
blends
together
really
well
balanced
d
quite
a
easy
drinker
nothing
overpowering
but
its
not
weak
on
anything
would
make
for
a
great
session
beer
d
good
scottish
ale
easy
drinker
a
nice
brew
while
relaxing
at
home
i
imagine
this
would
be
best
on
tap
at
the
local
pub
the
nose
is
has
pleasant
hints
of
blackcurrant
and
chocolate
suggesting
a
malt
heavy
beverage
the
beer
tastes
more
tart
than
i
was
expecting
a
chocolate
raspberry
affair
with
considerable
carbonation
and
more
biscuity
and
herbal
flavours
in
the
aftertaste
a
good
sipper
d
light
but
weirdly
sour
and
not
that
great
its
pretty
good
at
first
but
cant
even
last
half
a
pint
grab
something
else
taste
is
toasty
bread
crust
dryish
woodyearthy
leaves
hint
of
chocolate
balanced
sweetness
and
bitterness
the
latter
just
dominating
the
finish
which
is

a

feel
is
firm
one
of
several
birthday
presents
from

it
wasnt
as
dark
as
i
expected
especially
since
the
label
states
dark
scottish
ale
but
still
pretty
good
looking
it
comes
out
a
little
bit
of
an
orange

color
not
as
creamy
as
other
scottish
ales
ive
had
in

abv
i
coud
drink
a
few
well
quite
a
few
pours
a
very
dark
ruby
almost
brown
with
a
massive
head
and
tremendous
lacing
on
the
second
pour
from
the
bottle
flocculants
were
predominate
and
totally
hazed
what
was
a
perfect
appearance
making
it
opaque
light
nose
of
caramel
malt
over
a
slight
floral
component
the
body
is
almost
medium
with
normal
carbonation
the
flavor
is
a
mixed
bag
of
citrus
biscuit
cherry
and
earthy
hops
finishes
with
a
bit
of
tartness
o
a
good
beer
not
a
great
one
seems
a
little
overpriced
at
6
a
pint
very
drinkable
and
pleasant
just
nothing
stellar
o
truthfully
i
was
not
expecting
much
when
i
cracked
this
beer
but
its
a
very
pleasant
surprise
theres
loads
of
hop
character
that
you
just
dont
typically
see
in
these
sorts
of
beers
and
in
this
part
of
the
world
floral
bold
and
even
aggressive
in
nature
the
hops
play
the
foil
perfectly
to
the
expectantly
fat
and
rich
malt
body
a
wonderful
beer
a
light
scottish
ale
very
good
beer
refreshing
tasty
and
still
complex
i
would
love
to
see
a
version
with
higher
alcohol
and
body
dont
recall
well
how
this
compares
to
their
robust
skull
splitter
overall
its
okay
4
abv
obviously
they
are
trying
to
make
their
trademark
it
also
may
actually
be
older
than
expected
for
drinking
due
to
the
place
i
purchased
it
o
a
very
tasty
and
complex
beer
very
enjoyable
will
have
again

theres
a

not
my
favorite
beer
by
orkney
brewery
the
flavor
and
aroma
were
a
little
different
and
slightly
off
a
decent
enough
uk
ale
but
i
cant
forgive
the
stony
edginess
as
inoffensive
as
it
is
tastewise
as
it
still
affects
the
whole
mouthfeel
and
general
perception
of
the
whole
offering
a
sour
kind
of
unappealing
fruitiness
where
im
expecting
big
sort
of
treacly
malt
sweetness
sorry
to
say
an
orkney
concern
has
finally
failed
me
in
the
general
keeping
up
with
the
joneses
sense
overall
the
body
of
the
beer
is
medium
and
the
finish
is
medium
too

beer
is
good
with
lots
of
flavor
packed
into
this
beer
i
would
have
like
to
seen
more
complex
flavor
in
this
beer
to
give
it
a
better
body
it
is
a
good
beer
but

kick
in

to

pleasant
but
not
exceptional
probably
largely
due
to
the
low
abv
overall
this
is
impressive
stuff
its
not
really
that
remarkable
on
its
own
and
i
wouldnt
be
so
compelled
by
it
if
i
was
served
it
blind
perhapsbut
i
dont
recall
having
a
richer
more
flavoursome
beer
at
below
5
abv
before
this
does
a
really
good
job
for
what
it
is
d
this
was
a
decent
light
red
ale
very
traditional
but
nothing
special
otherwise
the
scent
and
taste
werent
my
preference
and
the
body
was
kind
of
weak
the
finish
had
a
lingering
flavor

didnt

care

mouthfeel
is

but
goes
down
smooth
would
love
to
see
how
this
beer
is
served
on
cask
but
ill
just
have
to
dream
for
now
overall
this
beer
was
a
decent
beer
and
very
sessionable
was
expecting
more
but
at
4
one
should
not
complain
with
all
the
flavor
medium
bodied
with
good
carbonation
the
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
is
just
what
one
would
expect
from
the
style
the
body
is
just
dense
enough
to
coat
the
mouth
and
allow
the
flavors
to
pop
while
never
becoming
sticky
the
carbonation
is
a
little
fizzy
and
seems
just
right
with
the
body
i
am
torn
on
this
beer
i
want
to
like
it
a
lot
but
it
seems
out
of
balance
a
little
more
malt
and
a
little
less
hops
i
feel
would
be
perfect
httpabarwithnoname
wordpress
com
overall
not
a
bad
session
beer
although
as
i
said
not
precisely
to
my
taste
i
wonder
how
this
stuff
is
on
cask
afterwards
wow
the
burp
is
a
wonderful
malty
cream
did
i
drink
it
too
cold
45f
a
good
session
beer
spicy
hops
brings
the
overall
complexity
of
the
beer
to
a
decent
level
however
for
a
scottish
session
ale
like
this
i
would
have
liked
to
see
a
little
more
complexity
of
the
malt
flavors
and
since
it
provides
a
minimal
alcohol
it
being
4
abv
the
red
macgregor
portends
numerous
quaffs
to
anyone
who
finds
themselves
among
the
craggy
coast
of
orkney
a
session
beer
definitely
drinkable
as
hell
exciting
as
algebra
i
was
hoping
for
something
else
something
more
ive
had
this
beer
many
times
only
done
a
good
bit
better
great
for
the
style
and
a
session
beer
if
you
can
afford
it
this
is
an
excellent
scottish
red
ale
it
tastes
a
little
sweet
to
my
palate
after
two
years
away
from
scotland
but
i
remember
these
red
beers
being
refreshing
and
crisp
when
available
i
wonder
if
there
is
any
additional
malt
or
sugar
used
in
export
bottling
as
this
seems
a
touch
sweeter
than
when
i
had
it
on
tap
but
the
memory
is
a
fleeting
and
distrustful
thing
overall
a
good
beer
to
session
o
this
beer
goes
down
very
easily
and
is
also
very
sessionable
given
its
low
alcohol
content
i
have
to
say
this
is
my
second
scottish
ale
of
the
night
and
it
isnt
a
terrible
beer
but
if
im
ever
in
scotland
im
drinking
the
scotch
before
the
beers
i
would
imagine
this
is
lovely
on
cask
i
did
in
fact
have
it
on
cask
in
edinburgh
a
couple
years
ago
but
the
details
are
sketchy
regardless
i
find
this
to
have
been
splendid
from
the
bottle
delightfully
relatively
effervescent
while
retaining
both
palpable
flavors
and
a
balanced
blend
with
them
took
my
time
sipping
this
one
d
a
good
cask
beer
hoppier
than
usual
and
good
going
down
recommended
probably
my
favorite
scottish
ale
to
date
very
enjoyable
beer
a
nice
low
abv
departure
from
what
i
normally
drink
i
think
that
i
need
to
start
looking
harder
at
lower
abv
brews
i
bought
this
by
accident
because
i
was
trying
to
refill
my
stock
of
dark
island
and
this
similar
looking
bottle
was
grabbed
by
mistake
though
it
is
not
nearly
the
equal
of
dark
island
its
a
mistake
ill
be
happy
to
revisit
again
d
pretty
interesting
beer
a
little
more
hoppy
than
i
was
expecting
it
is
a
beautiful
and
interesting
brew
with
a
pretty
low
abv
one
was
enough
for
me
body
is
a
little
thing
id
like
something
more
syrup
to
go
with
those
rich
flavours
drinkability
is
good
nothing
too
exciting
about
this
one
but
easy
enough
to
drink
the
folks
in
the
orkneys
have
a
winner
not
exactly
what
id
consider
a
scottish
ale
but
definitely
an
enjoyable
one
i
first
had
the
pleasure
of
enjoying
this
on
orkney
and
was
glad
to
get
a
bottle
here
in
the
states
d
certainly
tasty
and
balanced
well
hops
are
more
noticeable
than
expected
for
the
style
nevertheless
tasty
enough
for
a
session
a
solid
ale
without
complexity
yes
i
did
enjoy
this
one
d
a
little
tasty
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
mild
kick
decent
representation
of
style
its
a
fairly
good
beer
overall
but
there
are
others
in
the
style
that
i
would
choose
first
drinkability
good
with
a
meal
and
i
think
it
would
be
good
by
itself
too
complex
enough
to
make
you
remember
it
and
pleasantly
satisfying
on
the
way
down
i
could
reach
for
another
if
i
had
one
generates
a
rootbeerfloatcolored
head
with
moderate
effort
the
head
lasts
forever
and
leaves
behind
plenty
of
stuff
on
the
glass
as
it
fades
slowly
it
gathers
into
a
stiff
peak
nice
light
spicy
citrus
in
the
nose
oranges
and
lemons
with
a
touch
of
cocoa
luminous
ruby
coloring
light
carbonation
moderately
dense
body
and
wowie
taste
this
is
one
of
the
best
bitters
ive
ever
had
the
malt
is
lightly
toasty
there
are
apples
and
rains
up
front
and
theres
a
nice
hint
of
chocolate
that
lasts
even
after
the
notoverly
spicy
hops
hit
at
the
end
what
a
treat
my
only
regret
is
that
i
bought
the
last
one
on
the
shelf
definitely
one
to
keep
in
stock
at
home
d
red
macgregor
is
a
decent
beer
orkney
has
never
really
dissapointed
me
but
this
one
is
not
amongst
my
favorites
its
still
worth
trying
however
d
this
is
not
watery
but
rather
a
mild
brew
resulting
in
a
highly
drinkable
brew
with
plenty
going
on
the
scots
are
getting
nicely
into
the
micro
revolution
d
goes
down
alright
but
im
not
chugging
it
its
average
the
taste
was
sweet
up
front
then
dry
with
a
toasty
malt
body
it
was
creamy
and
left
a
slight
hop
bitterness
on
the
finish
overall
i
found
it
to
be
a
delicious
scottish
drinkability
here
is
average
this
is
unlike
any
other
scottish
ale
ive
had
and
its
definately
unique
on
its
own
id
drink
it
again
in
the
right
situation
but
i
couldnt
do
this
one
frequently
considering
the
rather
cheap
price
4
50
for
the
bomber
this
was
a
great
buy
and
a
pleasant
surprise
crystal
clear
copper
ruby
hue
with
a
medium
tan

aromas
of

and

flavor
is
lightly
sweet
some
earthygrainy
notes
light
caramel
slightly

finish
is
light

delicious
and
leaves
you
longing
for
another
taste
a
really
well
made
beer
especially
at
4
0
abv
thats
what
it
says
on
the
bottle
a
great
beer
this
is
a
good
example
of
on
of
my
favorite
style
an
easy
drinking
scottish
ale
and
one
of
the
most
flavorful
beers
i
have
had
at
only
4
one
i
wish
i
had
more
of
this
is
a
fairly
full
bodied
beer
nice
and
smoked
up
not
overly
sweet
although
with
lots
of
caramel
and
brown
sugar
hints
there
is
a
slight
hop
bitterness
a
touch
drying
but
overall
just
lots
of
thick
malts
the
beer
is
quite
light
in
abv
there
isnt
lots
of
booziness
to
the
beer
as
is
sometimes
characteristic
of
the
style
the
smoky
somewhat
oaken
flavors
are
quite
nice
this
is
a
nice
beer
worth
seeking
out
for
the
style
lchaim
i
ate
it
with
fish
chips
which
went
really
well
the
malty
flavor
reminded
me
a
little
bit
of
the
flavor
that
you
get
when
you
have
malt
vinegar
on
the
meal
highly
recommended
drinkability
is
fantastically
high
i
really
love
this
beer
and
am
super
impressed
with
how
much
flavor
they
got
out
of
such
a
small
simple
beer
the
only
chink
in
the
armor
is
the
cost
which
is
about
6
507
each
if
it
were
a
4060
case
it
would
be
great
to
stock
up
on
overall
very
good
well
balanced
yet
complex
beer
overall
a
good
red
ale
too
much
hops
to
bee
considered
a
scotch
ale
i
would
recommend
this
its
very
good
and
easy
to
enjoy
d
this
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
and
i
could
suggest
it
but
overall
probably
just
a
little
above
average
red
macgregor
poured
a
brownish
amber
color
with
an
excellent
tan
head
the
smell
was
of
hops
fruit
and
slightly
floral
the
taste
was
a
mix
of
malt
and
hops
more
hops
then
malt
for
sure
hints
of
fruit
also
hints
of
toasted
malt
mouthfeel
was
ok
it
felt
a
bit
syrupy
to
me
drinkability
was
good
went
down
pretty
well
overall
i
found
this
to
be
an
interesting
beer
the
flavor
was
unique
i
am
not
sure
what
this
beer
is
but
i
did
enjoy
it
pours
a
very
nice
dark
ambercopper
color
with
very
little
head
and
almost
no
lacing
it
has
a
very
light
malty
scent
almost
nothing
there
excellent
taste
very
malty
nice
little
touch
of
smoky
peat
a
good
deep
flavor
with
little
hints
of
buttervanilla
it
goes
down
a
little
sharp
but
not
bad
its
a
bit
between
a
strong
scotch
ale
this
one
is
a
bit
weak
for
a
wee
heavy
and
a
higher
scottish
ale
very
drinkable
at
5
it
could
make
a
great
session
ale
im
pretty
satisfied
with
the
quality
of
the
offerings
from
the

dry

it
is
backed
by
the

the
dryish

makes
this
beer
definitely
a
thirst
quencher
while
the
residual
nutty
aftertaste
provides
a
kickback
of
maltiness
in
the
very

pretty
solid

not

d
it

an

ale
that
deserves
serious
consideration
d
nothing
worth
seeking
out
perhaps
its

from

i

it

on

this

will
buy
again
and
use

as
a

for
the

ladys
flowers
great
drinkability
im
really
surprised
this
doesnt
sport
a
higher
score
its
a
very
well
crafted
scottish
ale
i
wish
i
had
picked
up
a
few
more
oelergud
the
beer
is
very
drinkable
it
is
easy
to
buy
a
dozen
and
finish
these
off
in
one
sitting
overall
an
excellent
scottish
ale
very
old
fashioned
and
very
pleasant
this
beer
poured
a
brown
color
with
a
ruby
hue
it
had
about

retentive
head
with
light
lacing
the
aroma
is
floral
and
hoppy
with
malt
noticeable
in
the
background
the
taste
is
malty
and
spicy
it
has
a
nice
flavor
blend
that
isnt
overpowering
the
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
thinner
than
i
would
have
hoped
overall
this
beer
goes
down
smooth
and
would
easily
lend
itself
to
sessions
this
certainly
doesnt
seem
like
an
english
pale
ale
but
id
recommend
it
nonetheless
a
pretty
good
beer
but
as
far
as
scotch
ales
go
a
little
light
in
body
mouthfeel
and
malt
heft
ill
guess
this
gets
a
4
poured
from
a
bottle
at
50
degrees
to
a

for
a
pale

this
beer
is
not
pale
it
is
a
deep
dark

color
with
a
nice
tan

that
decayed
pretty
soon
the
beer
had
great
lacing
though
smell

soo
was
taste
malty
also
and
a
little

tiny
bit
hoppy

just
about
right
i
really
liked
the
beer
and
will
buy
it

and
flavor

of
the

finish
was

a
decent
beer

not
orkneys

as
i
failed
to
find

in

overall
a
great
ale
very
well
balanced
and
enjoyable
recommended
as
far
as
english
pale
ales
are
concerned
i
really
liked
this
beer
it
has
the
maltiness
of
an
amber
caramel
toffee
with
the
hopping
rate
of
a
bitter
and
the
cleanliness
of
an

that
im

this

doesnt
rate
higher

headed
appearence
with
nice
lowkey
carbonation
aromas
of
solid
malts
barley
malt
caramel
and
sweet
breads
fruitiness
is
less
than
the
malty
sweetness
but
shows
in
the
forms
of
red
apples
figs
and
dates
the
flavors
closely
reinforce
what
is
experienced
in
the
nose
with
emphasis
on
the
malts
and
earthy
hop
flavor
a
mild
nutty
flavor
increases
as
the
beer
progresses
the
feel
is
a
rich
and
full
malt
feel
with
creaminess
carbonation
and
an
unwavering
firmness
finishes
quite
clean
without
any
abrupt
vaporation
graininess
or
bite
overall
this
was
a
very
good
beer
no
flavors
that
knocked
my
socks
off
but
a
solid
scottish
brew
that
offers
the
best
characters
of
that
region
i
will
certainly
have
more
of
these
in
the
future
d
this
is
a
fairly
decent
beer
while
i
enjoy
drinking
it
the
bitterness
is
something
i
have
a
hard
time
with
thats
just
my
taste
very
balanced
the
beer
poured
a
dark
amber
with
a
tan
head
the
aroma
was
simply
extra
malty
the
taste
was
so
malty
you
might
feel
like
you
were
eating
it
and
it
has
a
nicely
bitter
finish
the
feel
is
medium
and
dry
this
is
quite
a
fine
example
of
what
im
looking
for
and
generally
find
with
scottish
ales
it
has
plenty
of
malt
and
thats
fine
with
me
this
is
one
i
will
buy
when
available
anyway
the
beer
is
probably
worth
skipping
more
than
it
is
worth
drinking
but
it
is
unique
and
a
nice
find
from
scotland
as
far
as
scotch
beers
go
though
give
the
heather
ales
a
try
if
you
can
find
them
poured
an
aoragecopper
color
with
massive
slightly
offwhite
puffy
head
very
attractive
lacing
smell
is
firm
and
malty
with
strong
tones
of
dark
fruit
taste
is
truly
enjoyable
with
a
strong
sweet
fruitiness
balanced
by
a
nice
hop
bitterness
the
balance
is
almost
perfect
nice
and
creamy
texture
ending
shows
more
of
the
dry
bitternss
and
is
the
perfect
way
to
finish
off
this
beer
so
easy
to
drink
that
i
was
finished
before
i
could
get
done
writing
this
review
excellent
beer
i
have
to
rate
the
drinkability
pretty
high
here
its
a
substantially
rich
beer
thats
not
so
heavy
to
keep
you
from
drinking
more
taste
is
much
the
same
you
can
really
taste
the
crystal
in
this
has
a
nice
mouthfeel
and
its
hard
to
fault
this
beer
it
doesnt
stand
out
in
any
regard
either
and
is
good
but
not
great
in
every
regard
beer
pours
a
deep
well
red
thin
1
finger
head
dissapates
quickly
slightly
malty
good
deal
of
hop
bitterness
in
there
but
not
a
lot
of
hop
aroma
slightly
smokey
scent
and
flavor
i
think
they
use
a
small
amount
of
peated
malt
anyways
this
beer
is
good
if
you
like
any
of
those
irish
reds
killians
etc
this
is
a
superior
version
of
them
a
good
solid
dark
amber
scottish
ale
i
prefer
some
of
the
other
offerings
of
the
orkney
brewery
and
if
you
dont
like
this
one
dont
give
up
on
the
entire
line
lists
as
enlgish
pale
ale
here
but
as
ive
said
i
believe
there
is
some
peated
malt
in
this
making
it
not
taste
much
like
a
traditional
pale
the
scales
are
definitely
tipped
to
the
malty
side
with
little
balance
in
true
scottish
fashion
a
tasty
malt
lovers
delight
pours
a
dark
caramel
leaning
toward
red
the
head
is
rich
and
then
settles
to
about
inch
smells
of
caramel
too
first
taste
is
sweet
but
not
overly
so
its
mild
with
a
slight
bit
of
hops
after
the
sweetness
the
mild
sweet
then
hoppy
aftertaste
fades
quickly
not
a
bad
beer
but
the
price
3
99
at
my
retailer
will
likely
keep
me
away
dark
red
amber
in
color
decent
head
that
forms
a
creamy
foam
on
top
great
lacing
with
good
carbonation
has
a
bittersweet
smell
with
a
hint
of
spiciness
my
first
thought
on
my
first
taste
is
smooooth
and
balanced
just
a
bit
of
hop
bitterness
no
aftertaste
this
beer
bubbles
in
your
mouth
in
a
good
way
and
tingles
the
tongue
very
drinkable
great
session
beer
if
youre
willing
to
fork
out
the
i
had
this
beer
last
night
for
the
first
time
i
was
suprised
a
little
by
it
it
was
a
nice
amber
color
it
was
a
fairly
smooth
beer
a
slight
aftertaste
had
a
decent
head
on
it
which
lingered
for
a
while
i
think
you
could
drink
more
than
one
of
these
at
a
time
if
not
for
the
price
i
will
probably
try
this
one
agin
sometime
the
beer
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
nice
sweet
malty
scent
that
boasts
of
pale
and
crystal
malts
along
with
a
mild
bitterness
the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
dry
yet
sweet
malty
flavor
with
a
bitter
hop
finish
it
has
a
nice
roasted
taste
that
balances
well
with
the
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
good
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
good
english
palered
ale
it
has
excellent
malt
character
as
well
as
hop
bitterness
a
fine
sessions
ale
drinkability
drinks
easily
but
not
much
aftertaste
or

or

this
brew
looks
good
but
doesnt
really
deliver
on
its
promise
last
swigs
crazy
mixed
up
flavors
with
a
dry
finish
no
smoky
flavors
i
found
the
beer
surprisingly
easy
to
drink
considering
the
odd
almost
chemical
flavour
not
one
of
my
favourites
dark
amber
with
a
nice
creamy
eggshellkhaki
head
that
is
sooo
nice
and
milkshakey
thick
and
stayed
as
a
good
heavy
layer
nice
sharp
tart
dark
fruit
scents
good
amount
of
carbination
in
here
very
smooth
flavor
decent
basic
red
with
a
bit
more
carbination
than
usual
smells
much
better
than
the
taste
much
more
going
on
in
the
aroma
than
in
the
flavors
it
does
develop
a
bit
more
flavor
as
it
warms
the
red
macgregor
is
not
a
beer
that
i
can
recommend
orkney
brews
some
good
ones
but
this
is
definitely
not
one
of
them
cool
label
though
a
pretty
good
effort
tasty
scottish
ale
while
not
spectacular
its
quite
easy
to
drink
pours
a
nice
rich
amber
color
with
a
creamy
looking
head
that
settles
nicely
leaving
some
nice
lace
behindaromas
of
caramel
and
dried
fruit
cherries
and
a
nice
subtle
nuttiness
taste
is
right
on
in
my
opinion
nutty
and
deeply
fruity
with
some
caramel
tones
even
a
little
vanilla
flavor
in
the
finish
a
tad
watery
but
that
adds
to
the
drinkabilitya
very
well
done
scottish
ale
wich
it
should
be
coming
from
scotlandnice
job
reminds
me
of
irish
red
ales
but
not
as
fullbodied
or
malty
a
bit
too
thin
sorry
i
aint
feelin
it
overall
a
pretty
underwhelming
beer
poured
a
nice
ruddy
brown
for
some
reason
i
expected
this
to
be
more
of
a
red
ale
i
guess
the
power
of
suggestion
of
the
name
lackluster
for
a
pale
ale
and
not
beefy
enough
for
a
red
mouthfeel
was
average
while
the
flavor
was
rather
thin
a
touch
of
sour
lactic
acidity
lurking
in
the
background
with
a
hint
of
medicinal
flavor
finish
was
a
touch
sweet
with
some
caramel
malt
this
is
a
dark
amber
colored
beer
with
agood
creamy
beige
head
there
is
a
nice
slightly
citusyfloral
hop
note
in
the
aroma
a
good
mouth
watering
citrus
hop
start
to
the
taste
that
has
a
smooth
bitterness
through
the
finish
a
pleasant
suprise
again
for
me
was
the
good
use
of
hops
for
aroma
and
flavor
drinkable
brew
tastes
like
a
very
mild
rauchbier
drinkability
id
enjoy
this
beer
repeatedly
but
id
want
to
have
that
specific
flavor
in
mind
first
nowhere
near
as
bitter
as
many
other
red
ales
that
come
to
mind
this
one
is
quite
drinkable
orkney
rarely
seems
to
dissapoint
good
and
interesting
beer
golden
brown

with
very
little

moderately
deep
and
roasted
with
a
malted
sweetness
and
a
good
deal
of
earthinessmushroom
forest
floor
etc
flavors
are
interesting
as
they
hint
of
the
peetiness
found
in
scotch
where
the
barley
has
been
roasted
over
a
peet
fire
a
peety
malt
twang
shows
up
on

this

and
worthy
of
a
try

initially
some
heavy
caramel
malt
followed
up
by
nice
hop
bittering
smokiness
and
finishing
with
a
burst
of
molasses
very
well
balanced
overall
and
an
excellent
scotch
red
ale
that
i
found
very
likeable
the
flavor
is
very
much
of
a
smoky
peaty
nature
actually
quite
distinct
and
enjoyable
a
nice
change
of
pace
the
feel
is
medium
and
quite
crisp
tends
toward
a
dry
finish
though
falls
out
slighty
sweet

the
beer
came
in
a
16
9
ounce
bottle
i
like
the
crispness
and
it
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
i
wish
it
had
a
bit
more
aroma
but
otherwise
if
i
lived
where
this
brew
was
plentiful
and
inexpensive
it
would
see
a
mug
quite
often
drinkability

i
wont
buy
this
again
why
the
heck
would
anyone
put
good
ale
into
a
clear
glass
bottle
this
brown
amber
ale
with
a
fast
fading
beige
head
and
spotty
lace
releases
a
faint
skunky
aroma
it
didnt
have
to
be
if
only
it
were
in
a
dark
brown
bottle
so
sad
theres
also
a
pleasant
sweet
malty
and
light
fruity
aroma
the
caramel
malt
is
quite
liquid
and
rounded
the
lightly
citrus
and
tealike
hops
are
quite
tasty
a
hint
of
smoky
peat

this
could
have
been
a
terrific
beer

diacetyl
emerges
mid

and
is
well
integrated
complementing
the

presence
lightly
bodied
overall
but
the
ample

lend
a
smooth

not

from

at
the
outset
this
was
too
cold
to
appreciate
unfortunately
even
as
it
approached
ambient
temperature
the
flavor
never
seemed
to
arrive
it
never
got
past
a
stout
wout
body
left
me
waiting
at
the
station
this
is
an
excellent
dark
ale
i
want
to
try
it
on
cask
overall
a
nice
drop
but
a
little
muted
in
character
for
me
though
on
cask
i
think
this
would
shine
cheers
o
its
pretty
good
basically
like
a
sessionable
scotch
ale
guess
im
just
to
used
to
full
flavored
beers
its
kinda
like
skull
splitter
light
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
very
light
and
soft
mouthfeel
with
a
lot
of
subtle
but
no
overpowering
flavors
going
on
abv
makes
this
very
drinkable
this
would
be
even
more
phenomenal
on

i
procured
this
500

bottle
in
scotland
and
tasted
in

remarkably
dry
yet
quite

crisp
and

yet
quite
complex
and
flavourful
prost
lampertland
a
very
drinkable
scottish
ale
i
was
expecting
a
heavier
body
but
once
it
starts
to
warm
up
it
reveals
more
and
more
amazing
fruity
flavors
drinkability
a
good
beer
in
the
style
scottish
ale
dark
island
pours
out
a
lighter
black
and
offers
sweet
slightly
roasted
malts
coffee
and
fruit
on
the
nose
the
nose
is
really
exceptional
the
taste
is
very
good
with
fruits
and
semisweet
chocolate
up
front
and
smoke
lingering
on
the
backend
along
with
some
leafy
hops
and
highly
roasted
coffee
very
well
composed
and
delicious
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
creamy
and
the
drinkability
is
great
overall
dark
island
is
an
excellent
beer
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
creamy
tan
had
with
good
retention
and
lacing
moderate
aroma
of
coffee
toast
and
toffee
flavor
is
similar
with
hints
of
coffee
bitter
chocolate
raisins
and
toffeebrown
sugar
sweetness
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
and
finish
is
slightly
astringent
would
this
beer
to
be
a
little
more
fullbodied
but
the
flavor
is
very
good
atmosphere
is
good
decent
hue
but
a
very
slight
head
and
no
lacing
nose
is
a
great
malty
sweet
cherry
and
fresh
pastry
combination
flabby
and
a
little
shallow
slightly
sweetened
malty
tone
balanced
with
a
bit
of
pungent
peat
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
quaff
o
ive
had
a
better
bottle
than
this
and
on
cask
its
quite
nicer
couldnt
ask
for
more
in
february
500
ml
bottle
served
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
dark
brown
with
a
half
inch
tan
head
that
stayed
around
for
a
while
theres
a
decent
amount
of
lacing
the
brew
smells
like
caramel
malt
toffee
dark
fruit
roasted
malt
and
a
bit
of
leather
and
chocolate
it
tastes
like
peat
roasted
malt
dark
fruit
mineralssalt
chocolate
and
some
coffee
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
a
bit
creamy
and
slick
with
moderate
carbonation
i
liked
this
brew
and
at
4
99
a
bottle
id
buy
this
one
again
in
the
future
overall
a
decent
enough
scottish
ale
worth
a
try
overall
a
fairly
simple
but
tasty
beer
too
subtle
in
both
the
nose
and
taste
but
decent
none
the
less
being
from
scotland
i
know
our
beer
is
pretty
different
to
american
made
scotch
ales
a
pretty
solid
goto
dark
ale
this
is
really
nice
and
a
tasty
ale
this
was
a
great
beer
one
of
the
high
lights
dark
fruit
aromas
tastes
figs
settling
on
the
fact
that
lighter
abv
has
a
more
genuine
flavor
less
to
contend
with
when
you
include
a
higher
abv
it
is
why
i
appreciate
a
truly
great
taste
from
the
higher
abv
brews
i
mean
a
slurpee
can
taste
great
but
whe
you
add
the
vodka
to
it
it
diminishes
the
taste
right
we
are
drinking
it
for
partially
the
alcohol
and
the
craft
involved
to
produce
an
alcoholic
beverage
right
so
the
lower
abvd
brews
naturally
have
the
advantage
in
taste
this
one
has
a
great
taste
and
a
more
flavorful
malt
variety
which
is
great
but
i
hesitate
when
i
compare
it
to
higher
abv
brews
regardless
it
still
is
a
great
tasting
brew
i
suppose
i
feel
the
need
to
say
this
as
i
have
seen
many
reviews
knock
the
fact
that
it
has
an
alcohol
flavor
to
it
when
that
flavor
can
actually
be
difficult
to
appreciate
i
want
to
bump
up
my
review
numbers
as
i
feel
i
may
have
been
influenced
by
others
opinions
i
have
always
liked
this
beer
orkney
did
a
great
job
overall
on
his
beer
it
poured
very
dark
and
had
a
nice
tan
head
the
smell
was
of
molasses
dried
fruit
and
rich
malts
taste
was
to
style
with
more
malt
flavor
showing
through
than
hop
bitterness
but
for
me
was
more
of
a
sweet
fruit
than
dark
malt
the
mouthfeel
was
light
to
medium
and
finished
very
smooth
o
great
flavor
lots
of
complexity
my
only
complaint
with
this
beer
is
that
i
find
it
too
light
to
back
up
the
flavor
worth
a
try
to
be
sure
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
without
getting
board
went
down
quickly
and
i
thought
it
tasted
great

more

huge
frothy
tan
head
slowly

and
leaves
lots

on

a

with

with

abv
i
like
this
overall
a
pretty
remarkable
beer
a
lovely
scottish
ale
balanced
in
all
respects
except
maybe
for
from
a
new
world
view
the
abv
ah
hell
even
i
shouldnt
complain
any
session
ale
should
be
lucky
to
have
such
complexity
and
ardor
highly
recommended
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
i
was
not
expecting
it
to
be
quite
so
dark
and
to
have
such
a
wonderful
aroma
i
was
pleased
that
it
had
hints
of
smoke
but
that
the
smoke
was
not
overpowering
and
let
the
other
flavors
show
through
very
easy
to
drink
and
i
would
gladly
have
another
if
only
there
was
another
bottle
here
at
the
house
a
dark
brown
with
a
brown
head
and
good
lacing
on
the
pour
aroma
of
sweet
lightly
roasted
dark
caramel
malt
some
nice
hints
of
cacao
and
espresso
with
some
nice
dark
ripe
fruity
esters
taste
affords
us
with
some
nice
chocolate
notes
some
roasted
caramel
malt
along
with
some
nice
ripe
dark
fruits
some
plums
with
some
light
bitterness
palate
is
a
medium
slightly
creamy
texture
with
some
light
carbonation
finishes
with
a
sweet
toasted
slightly
creamy
dark
caramel
malts
some
cacao
some
dark
fruity
notes
and
a
light
bitter
ending
for
some
balance
this
is
a
good
tasty
and
flavorful
brew
almost
reminds
me
of
a
light
version
of
an
imp
stout
very
nice
easy
drinking
brew
im
glad
david
the
brewers
kettle
had
a
tasteing
and
more
glad
that
i
was
able
to
pick
a
bottle
up
pretty
spot
on
as
far
as
style
goes
so
this
is
definately
an
a
brew
to
me
heavy
mouthfeel
but
in
great
condition
with
a
lovely
soft
carbonisation
only
really
found
in
well
kept
darker
cask
ales
a
complex
beer
for
the
mature
palate
overall
id
probably
want
it
bigger
but
for
what
this
offers
at
this
low
abv
this
is
quite
enjoyable
and
impressive
really
like
this
quite
a
lot
body
feels
quite
watery
httpabarwithnoname

com
overall
i
really
like
this
beer
it
has
great
rich
flavors
and
is
a
pleasure
to
drink
on
a
chilly
fall
day
o
a
good
example
of
the
style
overall
this
is
an
interesting
beer
different
from
many
other
scottish
ales
in
its
flavor
and
low
abv
not
super
complex
but
definitely
worth
a
try
the
label
says
it
won
the
camra
champion
beer
of
scotland
twice
on
cask
that
is
something
id
like
to
try
someday
cheers
o
the
nose
was
pretty
nice
but
the
flavor
was
far
too
thin
and
watery
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
nice
shade
of
reddish
brown
the
head
was
white
and
a
little
foamy
the
lacing
was
thin
and
didnt
really
do
too
much
after
mid
glass
the
smell
of
the
beer
had
a
good
amount
of
malts
on
the
nose
there
was
a
subtle
sweetness
to
the
aroma
the
taste
was
earthy
malty
and
had
some
qualities
of
most
english
style
ales
the
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
was
pretty
smooth
it
was
a
little
light
bodied
for
the
color
of
the
brew
overall
i
thought
that
it
was
a
good
brew
to
try
glad
i
had
it
overall
a
decent
beer
im
not
likely
to
go
out
of
my
way
to
have
it
again
but
i
certainly
wouldnt
turn
one
down
o
not
really
the
flavors
i
find
good
in
a
beer
and
finishes
way
too
dry
for
my
liking
o
overall
i
liked
this
beer
i
would
drink
it
again
because
its
very
pleasant
but
it
just
doesnt
have
that
punch
it
needs
to
stand
out
its
nearly
there
right
on
the
cusp
of
being
a
great
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
probably
the
biggest
drawback
to
the
beer
as
it
stands
out
of
place
overall
i
rated
it
good
though
because
it
definitely
is
not
average
overall
pretty
good
light
and
sessionable
nice
darker
roasty
malts
toasty
soft
aged
brown
malts
brown
sugar
and
molasses
lots
of
great
dark
malt
flavors
in
a
very
light
and
sessionable
beer
great
job
o
this
beer
is
very
sessionable
given
its
low
alcohol
content
it
packs
in
so
much
flavor
that
i
could
drink
this
all
night
long
without
losing
interest
d
glad
i
tried
this
but
a
little
thin
for
me
d
a
good
beer
recommended
easy
to
drink
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
almost
no
head
appears
to
be
quite
a
bit
too
dark
for
the
style
lacing
is
nonexistent
the
nose
brings
forward
some
toffee
as
well
as
a
mild
amount
of
diacetyl
the
taste
is
lightlytoasted
with
some
roasted
malt
and
a
bit
of
sweetness
underneath
there
is
toffee
and
butter
body
is
light
with
low
carbonation
not
worthy
of
its
position
as
the
1
scottish
ale
d
no
reason
not
to
but
no
reason
to
grab
it
either
i
liked
this
for
what
it
was
but
it
needs
a
bit
more
aggressiveness
a
very
soft
subtle
beer
with
pleasant
flavors
the
latest
effort
in
my
quest
to
drink
the
entire
orkney
line
or
at
least
whats
available
in
the
us
as
scottish
ales
go
this
one
is
actually
a
bit
thin
in
the
nose
but
the
taste
more
than
compensates
its
not
overpowering
but
is
a
subtle
and
complex
mix
of
dried
fruity
things
leather
burlap
rope
and
a
teeny
bit
of
smoke
perhaps
it
will
require
many
more
bottles
to
sort
it
all
out
i
had
this
pint
with
a
handful
of
chocolatecovered
espresso
beans
and
toward
the
end
a
fistful
of
chocolate
jimmies
the
cheap
waxy
kind
from
stop
shop
neither
of
which
put
a
dent
in
the
taste
of
this
beer
another
superb
brew
from
our
scottish
pals
beer
is
medium
to
light
in
body
with
a
mild
smokiness
and
some
malt
sweetness
up
front
overall
it
is
pretty
good
the
midpalate
is
a
little
thin
but
overall
its
a
pretty
good
beer
i
should
drink
more
scotch
ales
the
beer
is
creamy
but
also
a
bit
thin
with
a
low
abv
the
beer
could
improve
with
a
bit
more
heft
but
that
being
said
there
is
a
very
nice
caramel
butterscotch
and
smoked
peat
type
flavor
to
the
beer
the
sweetish
dark
malts
blend
nicely
with
the
caramel
flavors
to
create
a
nice
balanced
although
thin
scottish
ale
i
had
this
with
salmon
and
it
was
a
very
nice
complement
the
aftertaste
is
very
mild
as
is
the
beer
overall
this
is
worth
seeking
out
pours
a
deep
dark
brown
with
a
light
brown
two
finger
head
smells
of
rich
sweet
malt
some
toffee
and
fruitiness
in
there
it
smells
wonderful
the
taste
is
pretty
good
though
not
up
to
the
standard
that
the
nose
set
dark
malt
chocolate
and
some
roasty
flavors
all
flavors
are
less
substantial
then
the
nose
as
well
unfortunately
there
is
a
metallic
taste
soon
upon
first
taste
the
mouthful
is
very
nice
too
mild
carbonation
structure
makes
this
beer
very
smooth
and
easy
drinking
lightmedium
body
overall
a
good
beer
i
will
revisit
to
see
if
it
was
a
condition
issue
with
my
bottle
this
is
an
odd
beer
it
is
very
light
bodied
which
was
not
expected
it
contains
a
lot
of
flavors
wrapped
up
in
one
beer
the
slight
sweetness
makes
this
even
more
different
the
flavor
complexity
makes
me
want
to
rate
this
high
but
the
texture
is
what
is
bringing
the
overall
rating
down
drinkability
i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
could
see
drinking
it
over
the
course
of
the
evening
as
a
session
beer
drinkability
is
pretty
good
its
thin
and
fairly
light
but
not
lacking
in
flavor
overall
id
prefer
this
style
to
be
a
touch
sweeter
drinkability
good
beer
with
a
meal
moroccan
style
meatballs
and
couscous
but
i
could
see
myself
slowly
drinking
one
of
these
while
reading
something
the
chocolate
and
coffee
just
make
me
think
cafe
in
a
way
but
im
doing
the
reading
in
a
pub
a
very
good
beer
d
an
absolutely
delicious
beer
incredibly
complex
with
the
characteristics
changing
from
minute
to
minute
as
it
warms
d
loaded
with
flavor
and
complexity
especially
considering
the
4
6
abv
a
little
more
mouthfeel
would
go
a
long
long
way
all
that
being
said
this
is
still
an
excellent
scottish
ale
offering
thanks
to
keith
dasbeef
for
trading
this
to
me
kudos
and
cheers
poured
into
a
sam
adams
perfect
pint
glass
its
its
far
darker
than
i
expected
for
a
scotish
ale
it
almost
pours
out
black
but
its
a
bit
decieving
when
you
hold
it
up
to
the
light
its
a
deep
amberredbrown
mix
of
colors
the
small
parts
you
can
see
through
actually
has
a
little
bit
of
clarity
a
little
lacing
but
not
a
whole
lot
the
smell
is
very
unique
it
has
the
major
characteristics
of
both
a
scotish
ale
and
an
english
porter
slight
citrus
smell
but
big
dark
malt
aromas
toffee
caramelized
and
chocolate
malts
the
taste
sets
itself
apart
slightly
from
the
smell
and
maintains
the
same
complexity
big
dark
malt
charactheristics
roasted
chocolate
caramel
and
even
sligthlty
burned
malts
a
little
smokey
maybe
peat
theres
only
a
slight
hop
tates
but
you
have
to
look
for
it
i
only
noticed
it
because
because
my
bitter
tastebuds
are
working
at
the
end
of
each
sip
the
mouthfeel
is
good
heres
where
you
can
really
feel
the
mix
of
the
two
styles
it
has
the
creaminess
of
a
scottish
ale
and
the
smokeyness
of
a
porter
pretty
drinkable
with
all
that
is
going
on
all
in
all
a
pretty
good
beer
this
is
almose
perfect
on
cask
one
of
my
all
time
favorite
beers
this
is
a
must
if
you
see
it
on
cask
more
of
a
dark
ale
than
a
scottish
ale
this
is
close
to
orkneys
dragonhead
stout
while
being
overall
a
better
and
more
consistent
beer
although
best
from
a
cask
this
is
quite
good
from
the
bottle
as
well
a
really
solid
and
tasty
beer
drinkability
surprisingly
low
alcohol
content
for
such
a
bold
tasting
beer
4
6
meaning
a
bottle
will
not
but
you
flat
on
your
back
hence
can
be
savoured
at
any
time
of
the
day
and
will
always
be
rewarding
the
soft
carbonation
jumps
out
right
away
with
again
subtle
smoke
making
an
appearance
the
taste
is
a
little
bland
overall
until
it
warms
when
vanilla
and
sweet
chocolate
come
out
blending
with
the
smoke
very
nicely
acquires
a
certain
vinous
quality
as
it
hits
about
room
temp
very
sessionable
with
a
silky
medium
body
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
overall
im
really
digging
this
it
smells
fantastic
and
tastes
freaking
awesome
im
not
sure
why
this
one
doesnt
get
better
reviews
maybe
i
just
got
lucky
with
this
bottle
poured
a
ruby
brown
with
a
good
onefinger
tan
head
that
died
quickly
and
left
little
lace
slightly
buttery
smell
mixed
with
chocolate
malts
and
hints
of
coffee
as
well
as
a
decent
fruit
smell
think
berries
a
sharp
juicy
fruit
splash
on
the
front
of
the
tongue
greets
me
akin
to
cherries
or
figs
then
a
mediumsized
smooth
and
creamy
body
passes
over
my
tongue
with
a
mix
of
bitter
chocolate
coffee
malt
and
for
balance
some
hop
bitterness
an
easy
to
drink
ale
that
mixes
fruit
and
malt
sweetness
with
hints
of
dryness
only
slightly
undone
by
a
bitter
finish
d
low
abv
and
good
flavors
make
this
a
good
choice
if
you
are
into
rich
roasted
malty
beers
pours
nicely
with
a
light
brown
head
which
stuck
around
quite
well
nice
colour
dark
drown
with
ruby
can
smell
the
chocolate
in
there
with
possibly
raspberries
taste
is
similar
with
nice
malt
and
nutty
notes
very
drinkable
smooth
and
creamy
was
much
happier
with
this
than
their
stout
has
the
same
smokiness
as
the
stout
in
the
aftertaste
want
to
nip
in
for
the
reserve
now
50
big
time
drinkable
i
will
definately
pick
up
a
few
of
these
for
the
fridge
bummed
ive
only
got
one
drinkability
interesting
and
i
would
love
to
try
again
fresh
its
so
dry
it
drying
my
mouth
out
though
weird
it
did
not
drink
well
with
me
maybe
it
had
light
damage
it
sat
in
the
store
for
awhile
im
sure
not
quite
a
winter
warmer
not
a
spring
summer
brew
very
enjoyable
around
a
fire
but
the
abv
for
the
amount
i
can
drink
isnt
favorable
to
sum
things
up
another
fantastic
beer
from
one
of
the
best
breweries
in
the
united
kingdom
granted
it
lacks
the
awesome
name
and
accompanying
controversy
of
skullsplitter
british
tabloids
are
either
the
pinnacle
of
human
idiocy
or
an
onionmeetskauffman
masterpiece
of
comedy
but
chocolate
raspberry
darkish
british
ale
is
a
combo
so
winning
that
even
a
drunken
chimpanzee
working
for
millercoors
couldnt
totally
mess
it
up
and
in
the
hands
of
the
fantastic
orkney
crew
it
soars
scrumdiddleyumptious
indeed
d
an
amazing
and
desirable
brew
find
it
now
overall
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
examples
of
the
style
of
which
i
must
say
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
this
however
is
a
real
tasty
brew
thats
definitely
worth
a
try
if
you
see
it
around
ales
i
have
ever
had
though
probably
not
ideal
for
a
session
brew
the
aroma
and
taste
complinment
each
other
wonderfully
and
the
flavor
profile
is
enough
to
keep
you
interested
this
is
definitely
one
i
will
be
coming
back
to
from
time
to
time
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
the
bottle
is
already
going
too
fast
could
definitely
have
two
of
these
0
5l
bottles
in
a
sitting
overall
a
well
crafted
beer
i
will
be
picking
up
more
in
the
future
and
would
like
to
try
the
big
brother
of
this
beer
dark
island
reserve
this
is
my
first
scottish
ale
but
based
on
my
findings
ill
be
comparing
other
like
beers
to
this
style
in
the
near
future
d
sessionable
is
an
understatement
a
pint
or
three
would
be
fitting
at
the
pub
seemingly
simple
at
first
yet
captivating
after
a
couple
sips
the
folks
at
orkney
know
what
theyre
doing
definitely
one
i
want
to
experience
again
this
beer
pours
a
nice
cola
colour
with
decent
carbonation
that
leaves
a
one
finger
head
with
nice
lacingit
has
aromas
of
caramel
toffeefigs
and
some
bitter
mochait
has
an
above
average
mouthfeel
which
finishes
quite
smooth
with
tastes
of
dark
plumsbitter
mocha
and
some
dates
aswell
quite
a
pleasant
beer
thats
very
easy
to
drink
dinkability
lovely
flavor
coupled
with
relatively
low
alcohol
by
volume
makes
this
perfectly
sessionable
but
the
heavy
mouthfeel
tends
to
encourage
slow
savoring
rather
than
quick
drinking
the
bottle
is
a
pint
0
9
fl
oz
and
this
is
a
perfect
size
would
do
well
in
a
sam
smith
style
brit
bomber
to
12
oz
would
not
be
enough
i
think
nearly
black
with
a
dark
red
tint
smells
fascinatingly
delicious
coffee
and
chocolate
are
most
prominent
with
red
wine
fruitness
and
toffee
bringing
up
the
rear
the
back
label
of
the
bottle
describes
it
in
the
exact
same
way
but
i
thought
it
before
i
read
it
taste
follows
suit
chocolate
malts
stronger
coffee
taste
throughout
black
cherries
some
astringency
a
bit
sweet
yet
finishes
dry
with
a
long
lingering
smokiness
that
i
find
to
be
the
most
pleasant
aspect
of
the
beer
being
the
fan
of
islay
scotch
that
i
am
it
makes
me
want
to
drink
it
slower
to
savor
that
but
the
light
body
says
keep
going
im
unfamiliar
with
the
scottish
ale
style
but
in
terms
i
understand
this
is
a
porter
with
less
roastiness
and
more
fruitness
really
complex
and
flavorful
for
its
strength
d
this
beer
is
mellow
but
rich
in
flavor
with
a
nice
bit
of
earthiness
and
i
would
love
to
try
this
on
cask
i
think
there
are
some
great
flavors
hidden
in
there
the
tartness
was
also
a
nice
compliment
to
the
malts
on
a
side
note
after
finishing
the
review
of
this
beer
i
went
out
for
a
cigar
thinking
it
would
pair
well
boy
was
i
wrong
what
a
terrible
cigar
beer
leave
the
cigar
alone
til
youre
done
with
this
one
finishes
pretty
long
pretty
nice
for
the
most
part
a
middling
scottish
ale
however
it
is
representative
of
the
style
and
should
be
tried
for
anyone
who
tends
this
direction
i
had
this
one
from
the
cask
its
a
dark
beer
but
by
no
means
opaque
smells
of
chocolate
malt
and
perhaps
a
hint
of
fruit
it
tastes
of
coffee
and
chocolate
lots
of
roasted
flavours
but
also
has
some
acidic
almost
fruity
notes
mixed
in
there
i
found
this
one
quite
drinkable
the
foam
was
very
dark
wheat
that
dissapated
quickly
but
still
stuck
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
smell
was
light
and
crisp
but
extremely
dark
and
nutty
feel
the
taste
was
excellent
hearty
taste
of
a
wheat
porter
with
hints
of
carmel
the
color
was
a
very
dark
cola
it
had
a
excellent
smooth
mouthfeel
dark
island
started
off
great
but
ended
a
little
thin
upon
opening
it
had
a
pleasant
aroma
followed
by
multiple
tastes
that
rushed
through
my
taste
buds
you
can
taste
a
subtle
hint
of
chocolate
the
roast
and
it
leaves
a
long
lasting
coffeecaramel
after
taste
i
sampled
1
pint500
ml
and
it
became
a
little
too
carbonated
and
thin
about
half
way
through
and
started
reminding
me
of
a
stewarts
root
beer
the
color
is
dark
brown
but
not
opaque
it
has
a
medium
thickness
in
pour
with
a
light
chocolate
colored
head
that
formed
nicely
in
the
beginning
however
settled
by
midbeer
i
did
enjoy
dark
island
and
would
recommend
only
drinking
about
two
after
dinner
as
a
nice
treat
to
end
your
day
this
is
a
pretty
rightous
and
robust
session
brew
d
easily
drinkable
like
i
noted
earlier
in
my
review
this
is
one
of
the
better
scottish
ales
on
the
market
its
very
enjoyable
and
very
approachable
the
peat
hits
just
right
the
few
beers
that
ive
had
from
orkney
have
been
very
good
thanks
for
the
brew
david
im
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
overall
a
fine
scottish
ale
by
any
standards
not
the
best
looking
thing
ive
ever
drunk
but
very
tasty
interesting
and
complex
the
flavors
are
quite
bold
so
i
think
it
would
be
hard
to
drink
a
few
of
these
a
couple
would
be
very
enjoyable
however
this
is
one
id
pick
up
again
for
sure
this
is
a
good
albeit
a
lil
light
bodied
beer
light
in
body
only
for
the
style
though
and
it
sticks
around
on
your
palate
for
a
while
which
for
a
thinner
beer
is
not
a
bad
achievement
d
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
but
definitely
a
drinkable
beer
this
is
fantastic
very
complex
and
a
slow
sipper
which
is
odd
for
something
with
low
alcohol
excellent
beer
all
the
way
around
drinkability
is
pretty
good
and
interesting
beer
defiantly
has
the
scottish
ale
profile
but
with
a
more
porter
like
malt
base
worth
trying
but
im
not
particularly
wowed
overall
nothing
different
here
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
honey
brown
highlights
the
head
has
a
nice
milkshake
quality
to
it
which
settled
into
a
sudsy
cap
the
aroma
has
a
lactose
sweetness
to
it
with
some
light
coffee
and
chocoate
notes
the
taste
is
of
a
lightly
roasted
malt
some
sort
of
milky
quality
and
a
metallic
twang
not
really
what
i
was
expecting
here
maybe
it
is
the
full
body
the
feel
is
very
smooth
and
chewy
quite
balanced
the
drinkability
is
fine
no
off
flavors
and
good
feel
if
i
didnt
know
any
better
i
would
think
this
was
a
stout
really
big
body
on
this
one
dark
ruby
brown
color
the
head
is
slihtly
tan
and
retains
itself
decently
not
a
bad
sight
to
see
the
aroma
greets
the
nose
with
a
brush
of
banbna
then
following
its
trail
is
bitter
chocolate
and
bourbon
barrel
well
some
kind
of
wooden
vessel
the
taste
is
where
this
beer
is
at
there
are
many
different
flavors
to
choose
from
it
has
a
buttery
smooth
feel
although
a
bit
flimsy
tastes
like
toffee
butter
figs
wooden
barrel
bourbon
and
a
dash
of
coffee
bean
easy
to
drink
without
the
buzz
effect
but
please
slow
yourself
down
and
enjoy
the
ride
dark
island
has
to
offer
i
dont
remember
this
one
being
so
peaty
still
a
good
brew
nonetheless
drinkability
is
averageish
its
not
terrible
and
i
would
enjoy
one
again
but
would
i
keep
a
few
extra
on
hand
honestly
i
would
not
the
odd
pick
up
from
my
local
store
sure
but
nothing
to
go
out
of
my
way
to
keep
in
stock
drinkability
is
great
very
easy
to
drink
nice
flavor
amazingly
smooth
d
easy
enough
to
drink
with
that
lower
alcohol
content
though
it
might
not
be
so
alluring
as
to
tempt
me
into
buying
more
of
it
nonetheless
a
fairly
decent
brew
that
i
was
happy
to
try
dark
brown
color
with
avg
head
smells
a
little
like
wine
but
more
of
like
citrus
fruit
and
coffee
light
in
the
mouth
with
semi
sweet
acidic
taste
and
a
deep
deep
coffee
grinds
dark
chocoalte
finish
very
smooth
drinking
good
beer
but
wouldnt
drink
frequently
maybe
with
desert
yeah
i
said
it
cause
of
its
coffee
flavor
dark
island
poured
a
nice
dark
brown
with
a
nice
tan
head
smell
was
very
strong
of
super
sweet
malt
taste
had
slight
hints
of
chocolate
roasted
malts
mild
sweetness
mouthfeel
was
good
drinkability
seemed
ok
it
was
a
bit
filling
overall
i
found
this
to
be
an
interesting
beer
seemed
very
stout
like
to
me
i
was
a
good
ale
but
a
little
pricey
something
like
5
29
for
a
500ml
bottle
not
a
bad
beer
i
would
not
turn
one
down
but
this
beer
confused
me
i
do
intent
to
try
more
scottish
ales
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
drinkable
and
possibly
more
spoton
than
american
versions
of
this
style
d
it
is
a
smooth
and
easy
brew
to
drink
but
it
is
a
bit
too
sweet
for
a
session
beer
it
makes
for
a
nice
after
dinner
treat
very
drinkable
i
could
easily
drink
a
number
of
these
overall
a
great
beer
poured
out
of
the
500ml
bottle
a
deep
dark
brown
like
root
beer
with
a
two
finger
tan
head
dissipated
after
about
two
minutes
to
a
skim
of
medium
sized
bubbles
intermittent
lacing
big
nose
of
roasted
malts
and
chocolate
malts
the
flavors
were
quite
enjoyable
roasted
malt
again
up
front
followed
by
peat
smoke
and
then
a
long
distinct
milk
chocolate
finish
that
coats
the
tongue
medium
to
full
bodied
and
medium
carbonation
though
technically
a
scottish
ale
it
drinks
more
like
a
porter
and
as
such
is
not
varietally
correct
but
all
the
more
enjoyable
for
those
like
myself
who
prefer
darker
brews
either
way
this
is
a
very
good
beer
and
worth
picking
up
d
4
6
for
this
gem
makes
it
very
sessionable
i
could
easily
drink
this
all
day
long
i
got
this
off
the
internet
but
now
i
would
spend
time
hitting
up
local
stores
to
see
who
can
get
it
like
it
a
lot
d
very
drinkable
at
5
abv
nice
balance
make
it
easy
taste
is
tart
dark
chocolate
sour
malt
some
licorice
some
vanilla
touch
of
woodiness
this
beer
as
a
scottish
ale
is
actually
darker
than
their
macgregor
scotch
ale
if
this
makes
sense
that
one
was
toasty
this
one
is
roasty
generally
i
expect
a
little
more
flavor
from
this
style
but
i
can
really
respect
the
subtlety
of
this
one
perfect
for
relaxing
on
a
sunday
afternoon
recommended
ale
tasty
this
is
a
well
crafted
beer
but
im
just
not
a
fan
of
the
flavour
this
is
a
solidly
drinkable
beer
it
reminds
me
of
a
stout
in
some
ways
particularly
the
heaviness
nonetheless
a
well
done
beer
this
poured
a
very
dark
brown
with
light
tan
head
it
smelled
like
roasted
malt
and
whole
grain
wheat
it
tasted
somewhere
between
a
porter
and
a
red
ale
with
a
dominant
malt
flavors
although
there
was
also
noticeable
hops
and
even
garlic
it
was
watery
with
a
little
carbonation
and
a
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
overall
this
was
pretty
good
and
an
interesting
scottish
style
ale
d
probably
the
most
complex
beer
ive
had
that
has
such
a
low
abv
highly
reccomended
poured
a
nice
deep
brown
like
burnt
motor
oil
had
some
good
carbonation
on
the
pour
and
finished
with
a
small
tan
head
that
stuck
around
even
as
i
drank
the
nose
was
roasted
malts
chocolate
figs
or
raisins
and
some
toffee
the
taste
was
oh
so
smooth
chocolate
coffee
figs
and
roasted
goodnes
mouthfeel
was
excpetional
it
libgered
around
for
a
good
10
seconds
on
the
finish
exceptional
beer
its
very
drinkable
i
would
give
it
a
4
5
on
drinkability
if
it
had
a
little
more
body
malty
smoky
meaty
aroma
very
much
like
a
german
rauchbier
very
dark
brown
with
a
thick
rocky
mostly
lasting
tan
head
very
malty
flavor
with
slightly
smoky
flavor
and
slight
sourness
and
bitterness
mediumlight
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
with
a
fairly
long
mellow
finish
aftertaste
similar
to
aroma
malty
smoky
and
meaty
nice
beer
not
what
i
expected
but
a
pleasant
surprise
i
went
in
my
favorite
store
looking
to
get
some
dragonhead
stoutand
lo
and
behold
they
were
outso
seeing
this
and
noticing
that
it
was
from
the
same
breweryi
thought
what
the
hellill
give
it
a
try
im
glad
i
did
this
one
imho
is
incredible
it
had
everything
i
look
for
in
a
beerand
i
cannot
not
wait
to
get
some
more
notes
bought
this
on
a
whim
and
it
isnt
for
me
there
are
better
scottish
ales
mediumbodied
easy
to
drink
poured
into
a
sa
glass
a
dark
brown
color
nice
carbonation
nice
little
creamy
tan
head
some
nice
sticky
lacing
follows
the
nose
is
malty
chocolate
toffee
caramel
and
some
smokyness
the
taste
is
malty
smoky
chocolatetoffeecaramel
the
finish
is
dry
and
slight
bitter
medium
body
drinkable
i
really
do
not
care
for
the
smokyness
ever
so
slight
d
highly
drinkable
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
from
this
as
the
bottle
proclaims
it
to
be
a
dark
ale
whatever
that
means
i
am
very
happy
i
picked
this
up
will
definitely
drink
again
could
session
with
this
beer
too
pours
a
very
dark
brown

very
interesting
and

but
i
prefer
a
touch
more
complexity
on
the
tongue
for
the
style
o
simple
amazing
worth
getting
if
you
see
it
great
beer
a
perfect
orcadian
ale
enhanced
by
the
whisky
aging
the
best
from
the
brewery
and
personally
it
surpassed
some
russian
imperials
and
scotch
ales
that
i
usually
hold
dear
a
lovely
interplay
of
complex
flavours
it
is
malty
and
fruity
with
vanilla
and
oak
big
presence
but
so
smooth
drinking
one
to
try
for
sure
body
feels
a
bit
light
i
poured
the
beer
into
a
glass
chalice
it
was
dark
some
light
got
through
and
the
color
was
dark
brown
the
head
was
coffee
with
cream
color
i
could
smell
some
fruit
the
taste
started
out
heavy
on
fruit
and
vanilla
and
oak
i
couldnt
taste
much
peat
or
other
flavors
i
associate
with
whisky
initially
as
i
worked
through
the
bottle
more
roasty
and
peaty
flavors
came
out
the
beer
was
easy
on
my
mouth
thick
and
rich
i
noticed
a
warmth
from
the
alcohol
instead
of
a
burn
oan
intesely
dark
ale
that
slaps
you
across
the
face
with
its
boldness
could
have
perhaps
benefited
from
another
6
months
in
the
bottle
d
nicely
done
the
aroma
is
much
better
than
the
flavor
but
everything
works
well

the
end

the
whiskey
understated
in
sharpness
but
still
providing
flavor
supporting
notes
include
dark
chocolate
citrus
earthy
hops
rye
breads
and
licorice
the
aroma
is
great
the

is
a
little
mild
but
still
keeps
the
whiskey
flavor
while
staying
very
drinkable
very
nice
whiskey
aged

beautiful
dark

the

is

with
rich
dark
caramel
malts
dominating
along
with
hints
of
mocha
as
it
warms
a
strong
vinous
character
emerges
along
with
evidence
of
the
barrel
aging
and
hints
of
whiskey
the
taste
follows
suit
dominated
initially
by
loads
of
roasty
cocoa
espresso
and
dark
chocolate
as
with
the
nose
the
taste
really
opens
up
as
it
warms
unlike
some
big
barrel
aged
beers
its
not
in
your
face
the
woody
vinous
notes
are
subtle
but
so
delicious
hints
of
oak
vanilla
whiskey
and
dark
fruit
round
it
out
nicely
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
creamy
with
a
subtle
sweet
and
dry
finish
overall
this
is
my
definition
of
a
comfort

though
the

certainly
is
something
everyone
should
seek
out
awesome
bottle
and
labeling
too
and
i
can
recork
this
for
later
which
is
nice
it
is
a
bit
strange
that
i
get
more
wine
barrel
than
whisky
cask
in
terms
of
woody
adjuncts
given
the
proclaimed
orkneylocal
production
methods
oh
well
esters
are
a
funny
thing
they
can
act
as
the
chimera
rendering
things
in
a
slightly
different
manner
from
what
they
truly
are
anyhow
this
is
a
splendid
scottish
ale
with
strong
dry
stout
predilections
well
integrated
barrel
notes
and
a
much
more
subtle
alcohol
profile
than
i
was
led
to
believe
up
until
quite
recently
worth
the
wait
indeed
and
i
feel
that
i
have
not
let
todays
celebratory
poet
down
at

not
yet
pours
an
opaque

with
a

that
settles

the

small

form
around
the

on
the

down
smell
is
of
dark
roasted

cocoa
dark

port
whisky
and

taste
is
much
the

with
a
slightly
sour
fruity
flavor
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
roasty
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
that
is
tasty
and
rich
overall
obviously
a
far
cry
from
dark
island
but
that
isnt
a
bad
thing
hell
of
an
expensive
bottle
but
that
doesnt
surprise
me
so
much
these
days
good
beer
and
very
different
from
normal
stuff
i
drink
o
aroma
had
me
a
little
concerned
taste
didnt
dissapoint
i
was
pretty
impressed
with
this
beer
has
really
good
qualities
of
a
scottish
ale
and
imperial
stout
good
beer
lots
of
flavor
and
smooth
to
drink
hey
i
wasnt
blown
away
initially
3
years
back
by
this
however
drinking
it
now
ive
probably
for
the
first
time
experienced
a
cellared
if
not
ideally
strong
ale
interesting
some
things
to
take
forward
this
is
a
great
beer
the
price
point
suggests
it
and
the
beer
delivers
at
the
price
i
probably
wouldnt
buy
it
but
if
you
have
a
chance
to
try
it
or
go
in
halvsies
i
highly
recommend
it

thanks
tom
for
bringing
this
to
celebrate
my
daughters
birth
excellent
beer
overall
a
very
enjoyable
beer
decided
to
crack
this
one
saturday
night
while
relaxing
and
wacthing
the
stanley

finals
poured
into
a
snifter
dark
black
with
just
the
slight
trace
of
a
tan
head
smells
strong
of
whiskey
some
choclate
and
vanilla
some
figdried
fruit
some
roastiness
but
alot
of
whiskey
i
feel
like
im
about
to
take
a
sip
of
whiskey
rather
than
beer
taste
is
much
the
same
although
luckily
not
quite
dominated
by
the
whiskey
as
much
as
the
aroma
is
also
definitely
got
better
as
it
warmed
probably
should
have
let
it
sit
a
bit
before
cracking
itthe
other
flavors
shine
through
more
definitely
not
a
lot
of
carbonation
here
overall
maybe
a
tad
too
much
whiskey
for
my
liking
for
this
beer
to
truely
blow
me
away
but
still
made
for
a
very
enjoyable
saturday
night
while
sipping
on
this
one
slept
well
too
overall
an
excellent
barrel
aged
brew
highly
recommended
if
you
can
track
it
down
o
was
not
a
very
big
fan
of
this
beer
but
it
could
very
well
be
taht
i
didnt
understand
the
style
well
enough
that
being
said
i
just
didnt
really
like
drinking
it
a
whole
lot
opened
this
and
shared
a
bottle
with
my
cousins
at
my
grandmothers
80th
birthday
party
over
the
weekend
i
had
been
super
excited
to
try
this
one
since
i
got
it
a
few
months
ago
the
beer
poured
out
black
and
thick
looking
there
was
a
thin
brownish
colored
head
on
top
that
hung
around
for
a
good
while
but
since
i
was
sipping
this
for
over
an
hour
but
the
time
i
finished
it
was
gone
the
smell
of
this
beer
is
awesome
the
aromas
of
whiskey
wood
apple
cherry
roasted
malts
and
chocolate
all
spew
from
the
glass
into
the
nose
the
taste
of
this
beer
is
really
really
nice
the
aromas
that
are
on
the
nose
come
full
force
onto
the
tongue
for
a
really
crazy
joyride
of
flavors
from
start
to
finish
the
apples
and
cherries
come
in
a
little
tart
up
front
but
the
roast
malts
keep
it
sweet
and
then
in
the
aftertaste
the
chocolate
dominates
without
and
doubt
the
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
has
a
really
nice
semithick
body
to
it
with
some
light
carbonation
overall
this
beer
is
very
impressive
hands
down
it
has
to
be
orkneys
best
and
i
really
enjoy
skullsplitter
this
one
just
has
so
much
to
offer
its
not
cheap
by
any
means
but
i
could
see
myself
having
this
one
again
someday
great
contrast
to
the
normal
dark
island
a
big
beer
and
one
put
away
for
sure
note
since
this
was
in
a
swingtop
i
took
the
leftover
beer
home
and
tried
it
again
the
next
day
i
discovered
that
i
actually
liked
it
quite
a
bit
more
ill
still
probably
end
up
baking
with
a
portion
of
this
beer
but
id
argue
that
this
is
best
appreciated
on
a
clean
palate
the
taste
is
powerful
a
lot
of
sweet
maltiness
quite
a
bit
booze
some
roasty
bitterness
and
a
full
delicious
body
to
wrap
it
all
inn
too
bad
it
is
a
limited
edition
o
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
it
is
a
really
nice
barrel
aged
beer
that
is
recommended
this
is
a
good
beer
with
a
stunning
based
but
the
barrel
aging
process
has
drawn
out
the
beer
and
made
it
a
bit
thin
making
the
beer
less
delicious
from
with
the
fruitiness
and
barrel
notes
not
having
enough
malt
and
body
to
support
them

low
carbonation
overall
i
was
not
really
a
massive
fan
of
this
one
the
slight
mothball
flavor
coupled
with
the
alcohol
made
this
one
tough
to
get
through
the
mothball
flavor
wasnt
very
strong
at
all
as
it
was
quite
muted
but
still
present
nonetheless
upon
opening
this
thing
i
was
concerned
i
would
take
a
sip
and
drain
pour
it
but
i
was
actually
able
to
finish
the
full
bottle
just
took
quite
awhile
dthis
has
an
interesting
aspect
lots
of
booze
and
sweetness
with
a
strong
malt
presence
somewhat
straight
forward
and
rather
sweet
notes
overall
i
really
liked
the
mix
of
whisky
and
rich
chocolaty
malt
along
with
a
good
showing
of
dark
fruit
i
liked
the
mixture
of
sweet
and
whisky
neither
are
too
powerful
and
work
well
together

of

mediumfull
body
with
light

drinkable
and
in
a
beautiful
bottle
but
a
bit
expensive
for
not
being
a
standout
this
is
excellent
just
like
everything
else
from
the
brewery
a
great
combination
of
smoked
peat
and
fruits
it
really
melds
together
well
it
becomes
more
and
more
vinous
and
wine
like
as
this
warms
up
very
unique
something
i
highly
recommend
maybe
the
bottled
version
is
better
its
a
really
cold
night
tonight
and
thought
this
be
a
nice
one
for
sitting
by
the
fireit
pours
a
dark
chocolate
hue
with
decent
carbonation
that
leaves
behind
a
one

and
some
sporadic

down
to
resemble
a
whiskey

distinct
aroma
of

dark

lingering
in
the
backgroundit
has
a
really
nice
mouthfeel
to
it
which
feels
complex
yet
finishes
very
smooth
and
easy
with
tastes
of
whiskeycaramelplums
and
some
spicy
oak
and
to
be
honest
ill
easily
finish
this
750ml
bottle
without
doubt
its
an
interesting
brew
that
would
buy
again
and
store
as
i
did
with
this
one
i
had
it
on
a
couple
of
occasions
and
while
not
too
cold
it
sure
need
not
be
too
warm
since
it
loses
some
of
its
drinkability
and
strangely
enough
the
nuances
and
long
range
get
blended
into
one
losing
a
bit
its
sense
slightly
above
cellar
temp
might
be
best
d
the
whiskey
and
alcohol
character
is
pretty
timid
surprisingly
although
the
vanilla
presence
was
definitely
a
welcome
addition
ultimately
this
fell
a
bit
short
overall
and
the
flavor
just
drops
off
too
quickly
without
ever
reaching
the
dark
island
d
i
enjoyed
this
it
is
a
tasty
beer
but
not
outrageously
good
i
was
glad
i
got
to
try
it
as
i
liked
the
original
but
i
couldnt
justify
going
out
of
my
way
for
a
repeat
taste
thanks
to
foofaa
for
sharing
this

at

this
is
a
beer
to
share
a
nice
treat
that
i
dont
think
id
normally
seek
out
not
spectacular
but
a
very
pleasant
drinking
beer
lots
of
nice
balance
between
sweet
and
roasty
a
very
good
brew
all
up
lots
of
character
and
extremely
fullflavoured
while
it
lacks
something
a
little
in
complexity
it
surely
makes
it
up
with
big
ballsy
roasted
stoutness
stays
surprisingly
smooth
and
drinkable

i
was

what
i
could
taste
in

beer

the

up

be
interesting
definitely
a
sipper
very
strong
in
alcohol
taste
almost
seems
like
maybe
some
whisky
was
left
in
the
barrel
and
blended
into
the
beer
i
would
think
that
this
would
be
difficult
to
pair
with
food
and
may
only
be
paired
with
a
cigar
bottled
in
september
2008
now
a
year
old
i
think
that
actually
the
beer
will
benefit
with
even
more
age
not
my
favorite
style
but
i
appreciate
the
eff
out
of
this
effort
i
found
the
taste
to
be
a
little
less
than
i
was
expecting
from
such
a
grand
bottle
but
i
could
pick
out
the
enjoyable
elements
right
away
clearly
this
sipper
was
one
of
those
one
could
sit
back
and
enjoy
with
a
quality
cigar
d
a
real
treat
that
ive
been
looking
forward
to
for
months
ill
have
to
pick
up
one
of
these
myself
and
repay
the
favor
at
some
point
d
not
quite
as
good
as
i
had
hoped
for
still
recommended
though
lacks
some
balance
id
been
looking
forward
to
enjoying
this
bottle
for
a
few
months
after
having
picked
it
up
while
in
kirkwall
during
midmarch
while
it
has
been
great
fun
to
try
and
i
generally
enjoyed
it
i
must
confess
that
it
is
probably
my
least
favourite
of
the
different
orcadian
beers
approx
8
i
had
there
still
a
fun
treat
really
tasty
brew
very
unique
love
the
whisky
hints
throughout
could
do
without
the
price
though
d
nice
sipper
seeing
as
this
is
a
pretty
rare
beer
and
at
25
a
bottle
i
dont
expect
to
have
it
again
but
im
glad
i
picked
it
up
and
tried
it
d
a
bit
rough
around
the
edges
but
will
mellow
nicely
with
age
i
plan
on
buying

next

d
i
had
this
on

foggy
cool
beach
night
and
it
was
perfect
on
a
hot
midday
i
may
not
have
even
enjoyed

at

not
appreciated

a
beer
bought
in
a
touristy
shop
in
scotland
and
price
tag

about

so
it
aint

here
either
i
had
not
seen
this
before
though
probably
not
looking
certainly
at
the
top
end
of
the
market
this
was
a
treat
from
my
brother
cheers
bro
very
much
for
a
special
occasion
and
to
be
treated
like
malt
whisky
enjoy
one
at
length
for
this
luxury
try
it
at
least
once
but
you
will
definitely
come
back
funny
to
have
the
grolsch
top
on
such
a
beer
unlike
a
malt
i
finished
the
bottle
in
one
go
drinkability
a
fine
reasonably
complex
beer
packaged
in
a
classylooking
bottle
a
great
great
beercomplex
and
very
unigue
i
dont
know
how
much
i
could
do
in
a
sitting
but
this
is
a
really
great
sipper
and
goes
down
like
velvet
pricey
yes
i
will
get
one
to
cellar
but
have
been
dying
to
pop
this
one
since
i
bought
it
several
months
ago
pours
pitch
black
with
12

head
that
leaves
a
little
lace
smells
of
sweet
roasted
malt
with
a
warm
scotch
overtone
peat
and
smoke
taste
yum
starts
off
tasting
like
a
nice
mellow
scotch
with
roasted
malt
chocolate
and
a
hint
of
cherry
thrown
in
it
has
an
aftertaste
that
is
a
little
sweet
but
nicely
balanced
with
a
little
heat
and
the
peat
and
smoke
shining
through
i
was
immediately
impressed
by
the
complexity
of
flavor
excellent
balance
and
completely
unique
flavor
i
have
never
had
a
beer
that
tastes
like
this
very
full
bodied
this
beer
is
tipping
the
scottish
ale
scale
toward
stout
it
has
a
creamy
texture
and
a
slightly
alcoholic
finish
this
is
a
tough
one
to
classify
for
drinkability
it
is
not
that
it
isnt
driinkable
on
the
contrary
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
every
sip
it
is
a
slow
sipper
that
is
completely
unique
on
the
other
hand
it
is
pretty
expensive
and
very
rare
so
i
will
probably
never
get
to
taste
it
again
buy
it
if
you
can
find
it
split
is
with
a
couple
of
friends
and
expect
a
very
unique
experience
a
somewhat
murky
brown
color
with
a
thin
offwhite
to
tan
head
the
aroma
was
port
figs
peat
and
maple
i
tasted
big
boozy
flavors
of
port
dark
fruit
preserves
figs
and
cocoa
full
body
for
sure
it
had
a
warming
oaky
finish
with
nicely
integrated
alcohol
presence
a
fireside
sipper
for
sure
no
doubt
quite
expensive
and
yet
not
really
considering
the
price
of
pedigree
wines
and
sam
adams
utopias
if
i
had
to
live
in
an
old
scottish
castle
or
welsh
for
that
matter
id
have
to
make
a
fire
wrap
myself
in
a
thick
carpet
and
have
a
bottle
of
this
stuff
on
hand
if
you
see
it
dont
be
a
fool
buy
it
an
interesting
beer
and
one
assumes
the
lofty
price
tag
is
due
to
the
extended
aging
in
scotch
whiskey
barrels
however
at
the
price
theyre
charging
for
it
the
beer
almost
might
as
well
be
singe
malt
frankly
i
found
the
beer
to
be
a
bit
too
much
of
a
good
thing
though
perhaps
age
will
mellow
this
beer
somewhat
however
i
just
did
not
find
the
beer
to
be
so
exceptional
that
im
likely
to
plunk
down
another
25
including
tax
for
it
any
time
soon
a
refreshing
traditional
treat
this
has
some
potential
but
it
seems
to
thin
out
not
long
after
the
initial
hit
if
it
were
a
little
more
firm
i
think
itd
be
better
feel
is
decent
overall
this
is
okay
id
like
more
of
a
punch
though
i
have
had
this
beer
many
times
and
was
never
disappointed
and
it
is
just
a
nice
pub
beer
that
would
fit
on
any
decent
menu
it
would
be
great
if
i
could
get
it
on
tap
somewhere
but
the
bottle
is
fine
quite
a
nice
sweet
and
milk
chocolatey
flavour
that
seemed
more
like
a
light
milk
stout
than
a
scottish
ale
but
an
enjoyable
offering
regardless
and
one
that
id
have
again
overall
i
was
expecting
something
different
here
as
the
word
heavy
is
displayed
prominently
on
the
label
this
bottle
was
a
couple
of
months
past
its
prime
but
i
dont
think
that
made
too
much
of
a
difference
flavor
has
some
light
sweetness
with
more
caramel
and
toffee
present
nothing
in
the
way
of
peaty
or
smoky
character
at
all
though
in
fact
the
maltiness
falls
far
short
of
what
i
expect
in
a
scotch
ale
has
some
subtle
intimations
of
fruitiness
with
a
touch
of
hopping
in
the
dry
finish
overall
a
rather
bland
representation
of
the
style
should
be
called
a
scottish
light
20
shiling
beer
prosit
1480
certainly
scottish
but
not
very
wee
heavy
this
is
about
as
thoroughly
average
a
beer
in
this
style
as
ive
had
color
aroma
taste
feel
all
average
nice
but
average
can
you
say
mr
five
worth
a
try
on
a
chilly
night
in
new
england
but
not
something
to
save
for
a
special
occasion
enjoy
one
i
liked
this
more
in
the
beginning
of
the
pint
lacks
depth
and
intensity
drinkable
and
not
filling
but
it
is
a
trade
off
just
ok
this
is
a
good
beer
a
little
thin
but
good
pours
a
dark
copper
hue
which
leaves
a
creamy
two
finger
head
that
quickly
dissapates
and
leaves
sporadic
clingy
lacingthe
smell
is
very
subtle
with
aromas
of
light
burnt
toffeecaramel
and
candied
figsthe
mouthfeel
is
just
over
lightbodied
and
only
average
but
the
tastes
are
abit
better
with
hints
of
burnt
toffeecandied
figswheatgrassfruity
malts
and
finished
with
a
subtle
bitterness
and
overall
its
above
average
and
easy
to
knock
back
but
wouldnt
buy
it
again
cheers
o
this
is
a
decent
enough
scottish
ale
and
would
serve
as
a
fitting
introduction
to
the
style
in
the
end
it
doesnt
bring
anything
new
to
the
table
and
will
need
a
bit
of
refinement
if
it
is
ever
to
stand
out
from
the
crowd
dont
pass
this
one
up
yet
dont
go
out
of
your
way
to
find
it
either
sweet
and
caramelly
but
hardly
mouthy
or
big
a
touch
of
hop
flavor
just
because
heavy
it
is
not
and
probably
not
80
either
right
but
it
is
quaffable
and
im
not
reviewing
the
label
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
thick
fluffy
head
much
like
the
ingredient
list
on
the
back
there
are
scent
of
malted
barley
malted
wheat
hops
and
yeast
which
gives
it
an
almost
caramel
scent
starts
out
making
you
think
this
will
be
a
heavy
tasting
beer
with
its
malted
ingredients
like
a
stout
but
instead
it
finishes
rather
light
drinks
rather
smooth
as
the
malted
ingredients
really
hit
the
taste
buds
finishes
rather
clean
smooth
a
decent
beer
with
a
rather
interesting
drinking
experience
another
williams
brothers
beer
which
is
very
likeable
and
with
more
potential
than
the
score
might
indicate
but
because
it
comes
across
as
a
sort
of
out
of
style
beer
with
as
many
red
ale
qualities
and
that
of
an
80
i
find
it
hard
to
give
it
a
higher
recommendation
o
this
is
a
great
session
beer
but
i
think
id
prefer
something
with
a
little
more
hops
overall
flavorful
far
from
overdone
highly
drinkable
a
great
session
ale
o
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
is
quite
sessionable
i
would
have
no
problem
drinking
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
sitting
because
its
not
very
filling
this
one
pours
an
attractive
deep
brown
with
a
fairly
substantial
offwhite
head
the
aroma
has
a
lot
of
sweet
caramel
with
a
bit
of
earthy
peaty
malts
coffee
and
brown
sugar
finish
off
the
nose
the
taste
is
a
bit
watery
at
first
but
pulls
through
at
the
finish
with
nice
caramel
malts
with
just
a
touch
of
peat
some
coffee
and
chocolate
and
a
bit
of
earthy
hops
and
fruits
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
its
coating
at
first
and
then
finishes
drying
the
drinkability
is
very
good
overall
an
enjoyable
beer
thats
very
drinkable
ehh
nothing
special
lacking
in
any
sort
of
depth
of
flavor
and
complexity
this

not

considers
the

profile

the
quality
of

used
in

is
not

enough
to
result
in

intensive

is

rich
malt
and
a
some

a
good
fruitiness
that
is
deep
in
the
beer
so
you
cant
really
name
it
and
maybe
a
faint
bit
of
grass
taste
is
outstanding
before
your
realize
ti
you
have
swallowed
and
what
resides
on
the
palate
in
the
quick
remembrance
of
an
exceptionally
smooth
malty
experience
there
are
several
factes
to
this
malt
the
breaddiness
which
is
dry
and
crisp
and
not
too
deep
there
is
dry
cracker
that
keeps
it
light
and
the
earthy
peat
that
could
favor
a
variety
of
different
malty
expressions
but
finds
caramel
in
this
one
its
a
bit
sultry
its
a
bit
dapper
the
fruitiness
is
the
middle
and
this
finishes
with
a
subtle
rise
in
hops
to
a
light
grass
and
a
faint
bitter
underneath
the
beer
to
push
ti
along
the
palate
and
finish
it
with
a
lovely
lingering
malty
sweetness

all
i
can
say
is
yuck
i
could
swear
ive
had
this
beer
before
and
thought
it
was
a
nice
scottishstyle
ale
this
particular
bottle
that
i
brought
home
was
a
disaster
horribly
citrusy
with
absolutely
no
trace
of
malty
sweetness
given
the
excessive
carbonation
i
wonder
if
this
particular
bottle
was
the
victim
of
some
wild
fermentation
since
i
have
no
desire
to
buy
this
again
i
suppose
ill
never
know
overall
a
very
good
ale
thoroughly
enjoyable
could
even
be
chugged
without
losing
its
appeal
definitely
could
enjoy
this
one
again
many
times
over
to
the
point
nice
flavors
nothing
super
special
here
easy
to
drink
for
me
personally
on
the
sweet
side
so
one
and
done
the
appearance
is
a
bit
week
but
thats
to
be
expected
for
the
style
so
its
excusable
i
was
expecting
something
more
american
in
interpretation
malt
and
hop
bomb
yet
found
this
subtle
delicate
scottish
style
amber
fantastic
beer
notes
this
is
dam
tasty
the
breadiness
is
nothing
short
of
remarkable
cheers
overall
rather
disappointing
particularly
in
the
carbonation
not
sure
that
the
tartness
was
intended
either
im
thinking
that
this
might
be
an
off
batch
or
an
old
bottle
i
would
love
to
try
this
on
tap
or
really
fresh
and
see
what
its
like
because
other
experienced
tasters
are
giving
it
good
reviews
and
all
the
other
beers
ive
had
from
these
guys
have
been
spot
on
overall
a
drinkable
beer
very
maltcentric
as
expected
but
a
bit
sweet
and
lacking
in
exceptional
flavor

better

beers
the

laced
the

was

taste
is
a

with
a
hefty
pulse
of

a

to
clear
the

the

it

o
an

that
dont

o
goes

eh

average
taste
for

this
is

that
would

i

to

at

once
and
i
probably
would
buy
this

the
aroma
was
totally
malt
driven
as
you
would
expect
with
lots
of
nice
caramel

earthy
tones
nice
hints

grain
and
a
touch
of
almost
a

or
fig
like
flavor
as
well
very
nice
but
a
touch
on
the
light
side
would
be
my
only
complaint
with
it
the
flavor
largely
followed
suit
not
being
as
sweet
as
i
thought
it
would
be
there
were
several
touches
of
fruit
and
a
ton
of
grain
in
the
flavor

malt

some

the
taste
is

and

slight

of

fits
the
style
of

feel

with

level
tastes
of

a
hint
of
roasted

overall
easydrinking
well
blended
but
subpar
appearance
and
body
overall
next
to
their
pumpkin
ale
this
is
my
best
beer
i
ever
had
and
maybe
even
the
best
scotch
ale
since
its
not
a
abv
bomb
well
done
guys
this
is
a
nice
malty
sessionable
beer
d
drinks
quite
nicely
i
like
it
a
lot
decent
beer
has
an
interesting
flavor
different
from
other
beers
of
similar
appearance
certainly
richer
and
creamier
than
i
expected
very
little
hop
bite
which
seems
to
allow
malty
flavors
to
come
through
sort
of
tastes
like
im
eating
a
biscuit
i
like
it
d
a
different
scottish
brewleaves
a
little
pucker
factor
refreshing
quaff
o
very
drinkable
and
flavorful
there
is
a
little
nice
roastiness
to
this
beer
that
plays
well
with
the
sweetness
this
is
a
great
sessionable
beer
at
5
2
im
on
the
fence
about
this
being
spoiled
or
not
they
dont
have
any
best
by
dating
so
the
im
thinking
the
likelihood
is
that
its
just
a
bit
too
old
but
guess
what
my
review
will
stand
simply
because
they
dont
bottle
date
this
was
a
decent
beer
there
was
good
flavor
and
pretty
easy
to
drink
although
nothing
really
made
me
want
to
look
for
this
again
this
fine
tasting
scottish
ale
reminds
me
of
something
ive
had
before
appears
to
be
orangebrown
ale
this
fine
ale
has
a
sweet
aroma
the
taste
is
bit
of
caramelnuttybread
tastingkinda
like
a
dubbel
has
great
potential
to
be
all
night
party
favourite
not
to
mention
how
funny
the
label
is
p
s
dont
drink
this
after
you
brush
yor
teeth
this
brew
was
a
pretty
good
scotch
ale
not
my
favorite
but
still
quite
tasty
i
loved
the
rich
color
it
had
the
flavor
was
nice
too
originally
i
thought
it
was
a
little
weak
but
as
it
warmed
it
kinda
got
better
the
mouthfeel
isnt
overly
heavy
but
it
has
substance
which
is
nice
pours
a
reddish
brown
that
has
very
little
retention
no
lacing
and
high
carbonation
the
smell
is
sweet
burnt
sugar
hint
of
hops
some
caramel
and
coffee
the
taste
starts
out
with
a
sweet
brown
bread
than
some
caramel
and
maple
come
into
it
and
finishes
off
with
coffee
and
a
hint
of
hops
thirst
dog
does
a
great
job
of
blending
the
tastes
making
it
a
nicely
balanced
ale
the
mouthfeel
starts
off
slightly
creamy
but
finishes
off
dry
a
nice
beer
to
drink
when
in
the
mood
for
a
scottish
ale
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
and
acidic
its
not
the
best
but
it
isnt
the
worst
either
and
it
certainly
remains
drinkable
the
dry
finish
helps
in
that
department
a
great
deal
as
well
along
with
the
low
abv
and
the
lack
of
any
overpowering
flavors
definitely
a
solid
session
beer
that
id
have
again
in
the
right
situation
pours
a
rich
and
deep
but
translucent
reddish
chestnut
brown
color
but
only
a
thin
film
of
fizzy
head
appears
before
quickly
vanishing
into
a
faint
ring
the
aroma
is
pleasantly
potent
with
a
rich
malty
character
filled
with
dark
caramel
cherries
and
plums
the
flavor
isnt
quite
as
bold
as
the
aroma
with
the
primary
characteristic
being
a
sweet
graininess
that
is
reminiscent
of
maple
and
brown
sugar
oatmeal
but
there
are
also
the
light
fruitiness
from
the
aroma
as
well
as
a
rich
caramel
finish
the
texture
is
a
disappointment
with
a
thin
light
fizzyness
that
doesnt
match
the
rich
malty
flavors
overall
this
beer
was
complex
and
enjoyable
but
the
weak
body
really
deflated
the
flavors
leaving
me
wanting
for
something
more
substantial
you
know
man
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
its
drinkable
and
to
style
overall
i
thought
it
was
alright
i
might
get
it
again
but
there
are
other
scotch
ales
i
much
prefer
this
beer
is
clear
and
tawny
with
a
head
that
rises
high
and
leaves
a
lot
on
the
glass
coffee
brown
bread
a
little
yeast
and
a
bit
of
dried
plum
in
the
aroma
crispness
dances
around
within
its
creamy
mouthfeel
this
brew
packs
lots
of
malt
and
a
hint
of
spice
it
starts
off
bready
then
a
little
caramel
and
even
some
burnt
sugar
comes
in
modest
hopping
lets
the
malt
really
take
hold
of
the
palate
the
yeast
and
fruit
shine
in
the
middle
this
beer
has
loads
of
flavor
and
is
so
drinkable
a
dreamy
ale
i
poured
this
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
45
degrees
the
beer
was
a
tea
colored
concoction
that
poured
a
tan
head
that
went
away
very
fast
the
beer
had
a
slight
sour
smell
to
it
but
did
not
taste
so
in
fact
it
had
a
bit
of
a
caramel
note
good
lacing
was
present
but
the
beer
was
a
little
flat
tasting
still
i
will
try
it
again
md
light
body
and
medium
carbonation
certainly
an
easy
drinker
drinkable
yesin
an
out
of
the
usual
way
i
like
this
and
i
cant
quite
say
why
except
its
different
completely
drinkable
and
almost
sessionable
somewhat
citrusy
to
the
nose
crisp
flavor
pretty
main
stream
ii
d
overall
a
slightly
above
average
beer
although
it
is
not
all
that
memorable
not
sweet
in
the
way
i
expect
of
a
scottish
ale
even
if
some
caramelization
is
in
the
house
dry
and
bready
this
honestly
tastes
more
like
a
brown
ale
thirsty
dog
brewing
company
doesnt
get
enough
credit
in
a
state
that
also
includes
great
lakes

though
not
terrific
on
the

side
reminded
me
quite
a
bit
of
yuengling
lager
drinkability
not
an
especially
tasty
scottish
ale
overall
but
not
bad
tasting
either
not
too
heavy
and
a
pretty
moderate
abv
thats
not
going
to
overwhelm
anyone
not
really
something
i
would
seek
out
when
im
in
the
mood
for
this
particular
style
12oz
bottle
into
my
ommegang
glass
apears
a
light
amber
color
head
is
bubly
and
disapates
within
a
couple
minutes
not
much
to
smell
here
a
slight
woody

roasted

and
mouthfael
both
feal

me
with
to
much
carbonation
bells
ca
blows
this
out
of
the
water
i
could
drink
a
decent
amout
of
these
because
of
the
abv
but
wouldnt
want
to
pretty
easy
to
drink
for
the
style
d
a
drinkable
american
version
of
scotch
ale
12oz

a
nice
crisp

with
a
frothy
lasting
eggshell
head
that

smooth
burnt
caramel
and
brown
malts
the
taste
is
loads
of
sweet
caramel
malts
with
a
hint
of
sweet
and
dried
fruits
the
beer
is
light
bodied
but
a
bit
overly
sweet
this
is
an
interesting
scotch
ale
but
not
likely
one
id
pick
up
again
overall
an
interestingfavorful
beer
appears
a
clear
deep
ruddy
amber
hue
with
a
bright
lighter
khaki
hue
with
even
finely
spread
lacing
around
the
chalice
aroma
strong
smoked

an
amazingly
light

light
brisk

this
is
really
well
made
scottish
ale
theres

wonderful
mix

in
this
beer
sturdy

this
stuff
is
great
really
drinkable
im
glad
i
gambled
on
a
bottle
definitely
one
i
will
look
out
for
i
wanna
try
more
thirsty
dog
brews
these
are
solid
standup
players
in
the
ohio
microbrew
scene
i
heard
there
brewer
used
to
work
at
great
lakes
and
he
helped
formulate
some
of
the
famous
great
lakes
brews
so
my
next
stop
will
be
their
dortmunder
lager
aka
labrador
lager
d
highly
drinkable
scotch
ale
especially
thanks
to
the
low
abv
on
the
level
with
everlasting
good
example
ive
had
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
slightly
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
nice
beer
with
a
lot
of
substance
that
is
worth
drinking
for
a
long
time
d
easy
to
drink
and
very
impressed
notes
count
me
as
very
impressed
with
this
beer
a
good
and
very
drinkable
example
of
the
style
i
will
have
to
try
more
from
this
brewery
copper
colored
brew
with
a
small
ivory
head
good
retention
and
lacing
from
the
residual
layer
sweet
malt
level
with
noticeable
alcohol
component
the
nose
portrays
lots
of
malt
and
little
bit
of
a
spice
overlay
the
feel
is
full
and
creamy
with
lots
of
smoothness
good
drinkability
for
an
obviously
high
abv
beer
pours
a
deep
amber
color
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
and
some
lacing
aroma
of
malt
alcohol
and
cinnamon
warm
and
rich
malt
flavor
with
a
somewhat
syrupy
finish
another
foray
into
higherabv
beers
for
thirsty
dog
this
is
good
stuff
its
nice
to
see
a
new
scotch
ale
on
the
market
overall
a
tasty
mild
scottish
ale
that
is
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
mouth
med
to
heavier
bod
little
syrupy
but
thin
lighter
carb
an
enjoyable
tasty
scottish
ale
that
is
easy
drinking
and
approachable
or
maybe
this
is
an
edgier
oktoberfest
with
a
whiff
of
wood
smoke
whatever
this
is
its
really
quite
drinkable
actually
this
is
ideal
mixed
5050
with
a
sweeter
and
heavier
scottish
ale
like
the
one
i
have
a
growler
of
from
kulshan
in
bellingham
from
the
22
oz
bottle
purchased
at
market
of
choice
on
29th
in
eugene
22
oz
bomber
btld

the
body
was
probably
just
a
wee
bit
thinner
than
typical
for
the
style
just
a
bit
more
than
medium
drinkability
was
nice
and
smooth
but
the
lack
of
character
reminds
me
why
12oz
servings
are
better
than
these
big
bottles
overall
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
but
also
not
one
worth
going
out
of
your
way
for
worth
trying
if
you
see
it
o
a
good
example
of
the
style
very
easy
to
drink
great
session
beer
with
all
the
flavors
you
want
from
a
scottish
ale
pours
a
copper
color
just
like
a
penny
is
very
transparent
a
small
white
head
recedes
quickly
leaving
no
lace
on
glass
buttery
musty
and
woodsy
aromas
very
malty
mild
sweetness
with
a
mild
hop
spice
at
the
end
it
has
a
slick
body
thats
lightly
carbonated
subtle
raisin
or
dark
fruit
in
the
finish
very
mild
beer
kind
of
rich
no
smokiness
easy
to
drink
but
not
exciting
or
flavorfull
at
all
a
bit
boring
overall
a
very
drinkable
mild
bodied
scottish
ale
i
prefer
a
little
more
smoke
in
my
scottish
ales
but
this
was
well
balanced
example
of
the
style
overall
i
think
this
beer
is
a
good
example
of
the
style
but
the
flavors
that
come
to
the
fore
just
dont
suit
my
palate
like
i
said
worth
a
try
if
you
are
into
the
style
overall
not
bad
but
nothing
too
memorable
the
mouthfeel
doesnt
seem
to
hold
up
the
flavor
well
enough
opretty
good
scottish
the
is
well
crafted
o
not
as
sweet
as
most
which
i
appreciate
not
a
bad
drinking
beer
at
all
seek
out
if
a
fan
of
the
style
m
medium
bodied
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
it
was
cheap
flavorful
and
low
in
abv
so
you
could
session
it
if
necessary
not
mindblowing
but
not
every
beer
has
to
be
just
a
super
solid
american
take
on
the
style
o
average
and
probably
would
not
go
back
to
this
one
again
my
least
favorite
pelican
beer
so
far
dr
a
very
enjoyable
drinkable
beer
nice
delicate
notes
of
nuts
and
caramel
were
mixed
and
intertwined
with
a
deeply
rooted
grain
filled
back
this
was
a
malt
monster
for
sure
as
the
only
thing
that
was
easily
picked
up
through
all
this
was
the
dark
roasted
malts
that
made
up
the
majority
of
it
nice
bit
of
caramel
and
sweetness
right
from
the
start
and
this
really
never
faded
as
any
other
flavors
that
were
here
simply
mingled
and
swirled
around
this
there
were
hints
of
roasted
nuts
as
well
as
a
nice
bit
of
overt
grassy
notes
a
disappointment
o
so
far
ive
been
disappointed
with
pelican
beers
that
arent
barleywines
mouthfeel
high
carbonation
gives
deceptively
large
body
though
the
flavor
is
so
light
that
once
the
carbonation
subsides
the
beer
is
revealed
to
be
light
and
sessionable
nicely
done
this
bottle
could
easily
be
finished
by
a
single
person
and
leave
them
thirsty
for
more
the
nose
is
potent
and
is
just
as
grainy
as
it
is
sweet
herbal
and
earthy
hop
notes
peek
through
its
a
rather
thickish
brew
with
a
certain
creaminess
in
spite
of
the
substantial
bitter
streak
running
through
it
throw
in
a
fair
amount
of
carbonation
and
this
is
a
brew
that
goes
down
quite
easily
caramel
burnt
brown
sugar
and
cereal
grains
are
prominently
featured
while
hints
of
molasses
and
white
chocolate
appear
nown
and
again
earthy
hops
linger
in
the
finish
while
its
not
boozy
at
all
it
drinks
bigger
than
youd
expect
from
a
5
beer
well
done
d
a
solid
scotch
ale
with
some
classic
flavors
nothing
over
the
top
or
too
strong
a
great
sessionable
brew
for
the
style
overall
this
is
a
decent
example
of
a
scottish
style
ale
perhaps
it
could
use
a
touch
more
in
the
flavor
profile
im
glad
it
doesnt
have
that
metallictinniness
that
many
other
scottish
ales
have
the
fruitiness
isnt
too
assertive
and
is
actually
well
balanced
all
in
all
not
a
mindblowing
inyourface
beer
but
a
good
sessionable
brew
that
can
fit
many
occasions
the
acid
balance
on
this
beer
is
off
and
when
combined
with
the
fine
stingy
carbonation
really
detracts
from
the
flavor
experience
after
swirling
to
release
most
of
the
carb
the
malt
is
a
little
bit
smokey
but
comes
across
more
as
dry
wood
instead
decent
carbonation
though
at
times
a
little
light
and
watery
nice
but
at
times
comes
off
as
underdone
and
too
sweet
somewhat
drinkable
beer
but
just
doesnt
offer
enough
taste
or
a
pleasing
enough
mouthfeel
to
compete
with
others
of
this
style
that
ive
really
enjoyed
d
low
abv
and
very
drinkable
but
not
very
tasty
or
interesting
maybe
a
good
lawnmower
beer
or
golf
beer
d
it
goes
down
pretty
easily
nice
little
quasisession
beer
just
not
very
good
palate
is
mildly
sweet
up
front
with
good
fruity
notes
on
the
swallow
mild
hops
offer
some
balance
leading
to
a
mellow
finish
with
just
a
hint
of
astringency
notes
of
clover
honey
leather
and
a
touch
of
stone
fruit
body
is
fairly
light
and
smooth
appropriate
for
a
scottish
ale
an
easy
drinking
ale
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
offerings
from
pelican
tasty
drinkable
well
made
d
drinkable
but
not
very
exciting
pours
a
nice
copper
and
mahagony
wood
stain
color
not
much
in
the
way
of
head
and
foam
but
decent
bubbling
very
bready
aroma
with
some
sweet
pecans
and
a
hint
of
gummi
toasty
and
super
sweet
malts
upfront
just
a
splash
of
hops
give
this
scotc
ale
a
light
earthy
aire
some
candy
notes
in
the
middl
with
just
caramel
grins
through
the
finish
this
palate
starts
light
syrup
and
finishes
medium
husk
ok
drinkability
just
a
bit
too
sweet
for
my
taste
drinkability
lacks
some
of
the
peaty
complexity
i
was
expecting
but
otherwise
pleasant
enough
drinkability
not
really
all
that
enjoyable
or
special
as
is
my
experience
with
other
beers
of
the
style
it
is
pretty
easy
to
drink
but
this
beer
just
does
not
have
enough
unique
characteristics
to
warrant
a
spot
in
my
regular
rotation

d
not
at
all
offensive
just
bland
drinkability
is
good
this
goes
down
very
easily
a
nice
traditional
scotch
ale
the
low
abv
and
relatively
big
flavors
are
a
wining
combonation
i
cant
believe
i
sat
on
this
bottle
for
so
long
i
wish
i
had
another
nice
brew
flavors
pretty
much
mirror
the
aroma
with
a
slight
saltandsmoke
accent
that
usually
comes
up
in
this
style
but
these
are
very
subtle
backnotes
and
unfortunately
the
body
is
a
bit
too
thin
to
carry
them
through
as
they
should
be
definitely
thinner
in
comparison
to
the
ontap
version
i
had
i
tasted
this
first
ontap
at
the
brewerybrewpub
it
was
much
better
then
i
wonder
if
its
been
sitting
in
the
bottle
too
long
i
bought
it
from
the
cooler
at
pelican
on
oct
1
of
course
no
date
on
the
bottle
still
a
fine
brew
though
just
not
what
i
expected
after
the
robust
fresh
version
i
had
that
night
dryhopping
with
centennial
hops
gives
the
caskconditioned
version
of
macpelicans
scottish
ale
an
incessant
greenness
which
burdens
much
of
the
underlying
ale
with
a
vegetal
quality
thats
too
bad
because
the
macpelican
of
course
deserves
no
concealment
the
dark
bronze
body
is
silken
textured
and
delivers
striated
lace
but
the
late
infusion
of
hops
is
not
very
scottish
and
only
conflicts
the
taste
my
advice
save
dryhopping
for
the
ipa
d
average
scottish
ale
pretty
easy
drinking
however
i
expected
more
flavor
from
this
beer
thanks
to
cmaruschak
for
sharing
clear

color
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
that
disappears
pretty
quickly
thin
coating
of
lace
on
the

with
a
little
bit
of

medium
smooth
body
with
a
malty
flavor
touches
of
hops
and
fruit
as
well
the
flavors
dont
stay
firm
for
very
long
though
the
finish
shows
a
little
more
hoppiness
overall
this
beer
doesnt
have
the
legs
i
was
expecting
but
it
is
still
an
easy
to
drink
scottish
ale
mohogany
colored
with
a
thin
head
that
disappears
quickly
smell
of
caramel
and
malts
taste
of
grain
malts
with
only
a
slight
evidence
of
alchohol
having
a
light
medium
mouthfeel
a
light
creamy
and
smooth
ale
that
goes
down
easily
a
good
drinker
but
the
lacking
body
needed
makes
for
a
good
darker
summer
ale
drinkability
was
only
average
i
wanted
more
from
this
beer
as
i
have
had
lots
of
success
with
other
pelican
brews
the
doryman
was
outstanding
and
was
hoping
this
would
fall
behind
it
very
drinkable
and
a
very
pleasant
and
smooth
scottish
ale
pours
a
copper
colour
that
has
a
nice
bready
malty
taste
this
is
not
a
real
heavy
malty
bomb
but
rather
a
well
balanced
version
of
the
style
very
drinkable
and
very
smooth
on
the
finish
another
nice
beer
from
these
guys
goes
well
with
bbq
on
the
grill
drinkability
i
personally
could
not
drink
very
many
of
these
simply
because
i
dont
like
the
finish
however
i
can
see
how
it
could
be
an
enjoyable
beer
for
many
people
very
drinkable
stuff
on
tap
this
must
have
been
fresh
great
scottish
export
style
beer
a
very
clear
copper
and
not
too
much
head
a
small
amount
of
sediment
at
the
bottom
makes
for
a
hazier
second
pour
from
the
bomber
the
aroma
is
vaguely
reminiscent
of
metallic
lagers
not
really
distinctive
or
inviting
broad
sturdy
malts
lead
the
way
with
elements
of
caramel
butter
bread
crust
theres
not
much
of
the
usual
shortbread
flavors
one
can
often
find
in
a
scottishstyle
ale
some
nutty
elements
and
very
slight
toffee
the
hoppiness
is
appropriately
muted
not
really
grassy
a
bit
more
citric
like
pac
nw
beers
its
scarcely
noticeable
other
than
to
give
the
malts
a
slight
tweak
the
beer
can
at
times
seem
watery
but
never
unpleasant
eventually
a
scottish
malt
quality
reveals
itself
deep
down
but
it
only
shows
itself
intermittently
at
other
times
this
beer
oddly
resembles
a
copper
lager
as
the
munich
malts
take
the
reins
again
this
is
lacking
many
of
the
more
familiar
scottish
qualities
but
it
will
serve
nicely
as
a
regular
session
ale
one
with
a
reasonably
sweet
malt
background
and
thin
refreshing
mouthfeel
its
also
not
as
cloying
as
many
scottishstyle
ales
so
the
drinkability
is
good
perhaps
it
is
wrong
to
consider
it
a
scottishstyle
ale
at
all
maybe
better
to
think
of
it
as
your
standard
american
micro
amber
its
a
step
up
from
the
cream
ale
and
will
not
alienate
those
who
dislike
pelicans
intimidatingly
hoppy
ipa
i
can
imagine
how
good
it
would
be
through
a
handpump
although
i
preferred
it
on
the
colder
side
of
cellar
temp
ill
venture
to
say
this
is
pelicans
best
regular
bottled
beer
for
session
drinking
unless
youre
a
stout
fan
and
it
should
go
very
well
with
most
pubstyle
fare
esp
burgers
and
such
when
its

this
carries
over
into
the
beer
as
its

a

of

a
somewhat
unique
combination
the

hey
this
would
make
a
good
alternative
to
smithwicks
an
average
scotch
if
that
not
outright
bad
but
boring
and
falls
short
of
the
better
scotch
ales
wouldnt
turn
my
nose
up
at
it
but
abc
has
better
offerings
o
wow
this
went
downhill
fast
started
off
tolerable
and
really
just
nose
dived
into
unpleasant
offscents
and
offflavors
im
not
dumping
it
or
anything
lets
be
real
but
not
a
whole
lot
of
redeeming
factors
the
one
i
had
directly
from
the
bottle
seemed
better
overall
a
simple
and
serviceable
scottish
ale
a
good
beer
for
people
who
love
malt
flavors
although
i
usually
prefer
their
stronger
scotch
brethren
opleasant
scotch
ale
with

at

drinks

for
ghosts
of

past
the
soft

bitterness
taht
settles
in
after
the
malty
smoothness
its
light
and
refreshing

those
with
a
sweet
tooth
easy
to
get
and

the
finish
a

leathery
smokiness
is
apparent
in
the
aftertaste
lower
carbonation
is
working
well
for
this
beer
but
somehow
the
finish
is
dry
not
sweet
like
i
usually
expect
no
big
deal
though
a
decent
scottish
ale
worth
seeking
out
if
you
want
a
better
example
of
the
style
o
a
very
pleasant
surprise
reddish
mahogany
pour
dark
but
translucent
with
a
couple
of
stray
bubbles
on
top
but
otherwise
no
real
head
to
speak
of
pretty
typical
for
the
style
aroma
is
distant
but
expectedly
sweet
and
maltdriven
taste
is
a
bit
bland
but
sweet
and
malty
slightly
woody
caramel
and
brown
sugar
with
a
touch
of
dark
fruit
and
phenol
medium
body
fairly
smooth
and
drinkable
with
a
much
tamer
abv
than
your
typical
scottish
ale
which
is
not
necessarily
a
good
thing
but
i
suppose
it
appeals
more
to
the
masses
not
bad
but
nothing
id
get
again
out
out
brief
head
i
had
a
finger
of
lighttan
head
initially
and
then
i
took
a
short
break
ahem
and
when
i
returned
it
was
wisps
color
was
a
deep
reddishamber
with
nequality
clarity
nose
was
sweet
rich
and
even
a
little
hot
mouthfeel
was
approaching
full
slightly
viscous
and
as
expected
it
was
a
malt
bomb
on
the
tongue
phew
it
seemed
bigger
than
the
reported
abv
finish
was
likewise
very
sweet
it
was
a
fine
beer
for
the
style
but
just
not
my
cup
of
tea
overall
nothing
too
special
here
it
has
a
decent
lightly
roasted
flavor
but
is
somewhat
boring
nothing
to
really
go
out
of
the
way
for
mouthfeel
is
solid
at
medium
carbonation
and
a
moderately
big
body
some
residual
sweetness
after
the
finish
is
nice
not
bad
overall
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
it
o
nice
scottish
ale
all
of
the
usual
characteristics
are
here
and
are
well
balanced
would
like
to
try
this
on
tap
overall
this
was
very
average
and
easily
forgetable
drinkable
but
boring
overall
not
a
bad
scotch
ale
not
sure
if
i
will
be
seeking
this
one
out
again
however
o
just
not
a
very
good
beer
will
not
drink
again
out
of
a
chilled
bottle
the
beer
was
a
clear
amber
color
with
lots
and
lots
of
rising
carbonation
the
khaki
colored
head
retained
well
and
left
spots
of
lacing
down
to
the
end
the
aroma
was
of
slightly
toasted
malt
nuts
a
little
earth
and
bread
along
with
a
slightly
musty
note
the
flavors
were
nice
a
blend
of
sweet
malt
citrus
apricot
a
touch
of
figs
and
a
caramel
malt
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
the
body
medium
and
the
carbonation
frothy
very
easy
to
drink
and
quite
pleasant
though
not
as
assertive
as
many
beers
of
the
same
ilk
overall
this
beer
is
on
the
lighter
side
of
the
scottish
red
ale
style
not
as
smooth
as
a
killians
per
say
reminded
me
more
of
a
lager
with
red
coloring
with
a
hint
of
smoked
malt
definitely
a
beer
to
try
just
a
tad
more
carbonation
bite
than
most
red
scot
ales
d
this
was
a
decent
scottish
ale
but
not
in
the
top
tier
the
scent
and
taste
were
good
not
great
the
body
was
great
and
it
was
easy
to
drink
not
bad
but
not
memorable
o
this
is
nothing
too
spectacular
but
a
good
beer
nonetheless
i
probably
wouldnt
purchase
this
but
i
sure
as
hell
would
drink
it
if
someone
was
giving
it
to
me
which
is
what
happened
in
this
case
i
remember
this
being
a
lot
better
maybe
my
palate
has
changed
completely
this
is
a
average
brew
at
best
try
their
batch
666
even
though
its
considered
their
winter
warmer
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
pretty
amber
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
malts
and
caramel
taste
is
also
malty
some
caramel
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
an
easy
drinking
and
enjoyable
beer
this
poured
out
as
a
nice
deep
amber
color
with
a
tan
colored
head
on
top
the
smell
of
the
beer
had
a
healthy
amount
of
malts
and
grains
on
the
nose
the
taste
of
the
beer
was
slightly
sweet
with
a
nice
earthy
tone
in
the
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
was
decent
nothing
too
out
of
the
ordinary
here
overall
this
beer
was
pretty
good
i
thought
i
poured
this
beer
into
a
pint
glass
it
has
a
nice
amber
color
body
with
very
little
head
that
doesnt
stay
around
long
the
smell
is
sweet
and
carmely
the
taste
starts
off
sweet
then
the
hops
and
malt
comes
through
on
the
middle
and
back
of
the
tongue
very
nice
mouth
feel
and
overall
a
good
and
drinkable
beer
smooth
and
slight
sweet
flavor
of
the
malt
and
oatmeal
amber
to
dark
amber
in
color
with
a
hint
of
red
nice
to
the
nose
and
very
good
to
the
tonge
over
all
we
found
this
beer
to
be
eveything
it
was
advertised
to
be
worth
having
again
would
go
well
with
shepards
pie
or
a
spicy
dog
o
this
is
one
of
the
better
beers
that
i
have
found
in
the
scottish
style
of
beer
it
is
better
then
the
samuel
adams
variety
overall
not
bad
but
not
my
favorite
interpretation
of
the
style
pours
a
clean
mahogany
color
with
small
spots
of
offwhite
head
some
sticky
lacing
scent
is
of
caramelized
malts
with
a
splash
of
roastyness
light
fruitiness
and
earthy
hops
taste
follows
scent
the
caramel
notes
are
clean
and
not
overly
sweet
roastyness
helps
cut
through
that
lightly
holy
and
fruity
on
the
back
end
medium
bodied
lightly
sticky
a
nice
scotch
ale
not
overly
sweet
or
sticky
quite
clean
overall
increasing
drinkability
pours
a
deep
red
color
aroma
of
caramel
toffee
light
peat
and
bread
in
the
flavor
nice
roasted
flavor
burnt
sugars
flash
of
herbal
hop
for
balance
tastes
like
a
standard
scottish
ale
malty
sugary
but
not
overdone
a
well
crafted
quite
decent
brew
like
most
appalachian
offerings
this
one
is
easily
drank
quite
drinkable
example
of
the
lighter
version
of
what
i
still
call
scotch
ale
would
be
a
good
quaff
on
tap
o
overall
a
decent
scotch
ale
the
body
was
a
like
too
thing
but
it
had
a
nice
nose
worth
checking
out
if
you
like
the
style
a
good
drinking
beer
o
ehh
no
thanks
boring
forgettable
example
of
the
style
with
a
mouthfeel
that
kills

with

aroma
is

i
would
recommend
and

purchase
this
again

but
the

a

from
the

brewing
pint
medium
copper
color
and
one
finger
head
looked
beautiful
in
the
glass
not
much
lacing
but
still
ok
smell
was
sweet
malt
and
true
to
style
pretty
nice
flavor
for
a
pa
produced
scottish
ale
mouthfeel
was
medium
thick
and
minimally
carbonated
this
is
a
pretty
decent
example
of
the
lighter
scottish
ale
the
sweet
malt
character
comes
forward
much
more
as
the
beer
warms
giving
it
a
nice
amount
of
traditional
flavor
and
aroma
d
bomc
suggest
the
beer
really
opens
up
as
it
warms
and
i
have
to
agree
this
is
especially
good
as
a
nice
sipping
beer
at
near
room
temperature
this
is
a
good
beer
but
just
good
nothing
to
make
it
stand
out
as
excellent
this
beer
was
received
at
my
front
door
delivered
by
ups
from
the
clubs
of
america
beer
of
the
month
club
poured
into
a
standard
pint
beer
glass
and
allowed
to
warm
to
the
appropriate
temperature
as
instructed
in
the
accompanying
club
newsletter
beer
was
dark
red
in
color
and
exhibited
little
or
no
head
wonderful
malty
smell
and
tasted
were
noted
mouthfeel
was
good
despite
the
aforementioned
lack
of
a
head
this
brew
was
very
drinkable
for
a
scottish
ale
i
would
recommend
it
to
folks
who
like
this
style
of
beer
d
i
like
this
beer
ive
only
had
limited
exposure
to
the
authentic
lighter
scottish
ales
but
this
one
hits
the
spot
nicely
even
if
it
lacks
some
of
the
peatlike
qualities
i
like
in
the
scottish
brewery
versions
the
carbonation
is
a
bit
high
and
that
somewhat
detracts
from
it
overall
remember
the
commercial
id
walk
a
mile
for
a
camel
well
id
walk
a
mile
for
a
cold
brew
but
since
this
one
arrived
at
my
door
from
botmc
i
only
had
to
walk
about
10
feet
lets
give
it
a
whirl
popping
the
top
yields
a
molasses
honey
and
caramel
smell
pours
to
a
slightly
cloudy
dark
orange
bronze
no
head
at
all
that
doesnt
seem
right
i
have
more
to
try
and
will
edit
review
if
there
is
a
change
taste
is
brown
alelike
with
a
very
dry
chaulky
hop
flavor
mouthfeel
has
good
carbonation
despite
the
lack
of
head
but
it
is
kind
of
thin
and
watery
not
much
body
taste
is
consistent
throughout
although
the
finish
is
sweeter
than
the
start
and
middle
a
respectable
beer
but
nothing
too
special
had
i
not
know
this
was
pretty
low
abv
i
never
would
have
guessed
even
at
its
moderate
level
theres
not
enough
to
hide
the
alcohol
i
also
wouldve
thought
this
was
a
belgian
dark
with
the
dark
fruits
alcohol
content
creating
a
muddled
kind
of
flavor
i
find
so
often
in
that
style
cant
say
im
really
impressed
unfortunately
d
not
terrible
but
not
really
a
brew
to
look
far
and
wide
for
needs
an
upgrade
in
the
maltload
department
this
is
one
of
the
more
drinkable
scottish
ales
ive
had
and
would
be
a
good
session
beer
this
is
my
favorvite
scottish
ale
a
good
beer
from
pa
pours
a
dark
copper
color
with
a
big
white
headthe
taste
is
sharpe
and
crisp
a
great
mouthfull
and
drinkability
is
excellant
i
could
drink
this
all
night
and
have
its
a
winner
so
go
enjoy
this
beer
the
flavors
in
this
beer
were
certainly
inline
with
the
scottish
ale
style
roasted
malt
a
touch
of
malting
smoke
and
some
sweet
caramel
and
toffee
notes
overall
however
this
seemed
a
bit
like
scottish
ale
light
as
the
body
was
lighter
and
the
flavor
profile
more
reserved
thany
the
prototypical
scottish
ale
pleasant
but
not
memorable

a
surprise
gift
from
a
friend
led
to
a
pretty
good
beer
moreys
bottom
line
a
good
example
of
a
scottish
ale
one
of
abcs
best
offerings
imo
i
also
love
their
major
hops
old
ale
on
cask
overall
this
is
a
solid
scottish
ale
and
try
as
i
might
i
still
cant
get
into
this
style
unless
its
americanized
with
more
smokiness
worth
a
shot
if
you
like
the
style
pours
a
clear

color
with
a

poor

and
poor

smells
of
roasted

sweet

slight
chocolate
fits
the
style
of
a
scottish
ale
mouth
feel
is
smooth

crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
roasted
malt
yeast
slight
sweet
malt
slight
caramel
hint
of
dark
citrus
and
slight
grain
overall
a
good
body
blend
and
aroma
its
overall
quite
solid
imo
would
definitely
consider
more
of
this
as
well
as
more
from
this
company
as
like
i
said
i
havent
had
any
others
kudos
drinkability
while
this
beer
is
good
to
have
one
i
dont
know
if
i
would
want
another
the
flavor
is
so
powerful
it
took
me
aback
a
little
bit
if
i
were
to
get
this
again
i
could
only
have
one
in
a
given
night
poured
a
clear
attractive
ruby
red
with
minimal
head
which
receded
quickly
to
nothing
no
lacing
whatsoever
earthy
smell
as
expected
for
a
scottish
ale
taste
is
earthy
with
smoky
malt
with
touch
of
hops
more
fruity
than
i
would
have
thought
sweet
mouthfeel
was
ok
a
little
cloying
for
me
i
thought
it
drank
easily
had
no
trouble
drinking
several
in
a
sitting
decent
beer
pretty
pricey
at
least
where
i
purchased
it
so
probably
wont
buy
it
again
smooth
and
perfectly
carbonated
with
a
nice
creamy
mouthfeel
medium
bodied
easy
drinker
notes
this
scottich
ale
is
very
close
to
a
dopplebock
in
taste
although
it
is
thinner
reviewed
from
my
notes
this
beer
has
a
very
dark
ruby
color
it
pours
clear
but
it
is
too
dark
to
see
though
there
was
almost
no
head
what
bubbles
were
present
disappeared
quickly
not
much
of
an
aroma
just
a
bit
of
caramel
malt
interesting
mouthfeel
it
feels
light
but
it
isnt
really
that
light
not
too
much
carbonation
but
more
than
the
abc
barleywine
i
can
taste
a
bit
of
hop
flavor
and
some
caramel
up
front
there
is
an
interesting
flavor
in
the
finish
perhaps
raspberry
it
is
hard
to
say
but
it
is
vaguely
fruity
and
it
lingers
after
you
swallow
very
nice
d
a
solid
all
around
scottish
ale
i
could
drink
these
easily
one
after
another
however
there
is
nothing
overly
memorable
that
takes
this
to
the
upper
echelon
of
scottish
ales
looks
nice
ruby
hued
brown
color
with
a
tan
head
nose
is
basically
nothing
flavor
is
tangy
and
malty
as
is
usual
when
this
style
is
brewed
in
the
u
s
sweet
and
edgy
it
isnt
horrid
but
it
is
no
more
than
a
sipper
as
it
might
be
a
bit
much
for
some
to
deal
with
overall
a
tasty
and
simple
scottish
ale
it
lacks
full
depth
however
not
sure
if
i
would
seek
this
one
out
or
not
but
i
have
to
admit
it
is
not
really
that
bad
drinkability
this
beer
is
very
simple
and
straightforward
a
nice
malty
sweetness
throughout
no
bitterness
and
its
creamy
texture
make
this
a
very
drinkable
beer
however
its
lack
of
complexity
does
leave
me
wanting
a
beer
with
a
bit
more
oomph
d
i
found
this
to
be
a
very
enjoyable
scottish
ale
and
would
gladly
drink
a
few
more
if
i
had
easy
access
to
them
very
sessionable
d
a
couple
of
these
would
definitely
go
well
on
a
cold
rainy
evening
not
a
spectacular
beer
but
solid
and
enjoyable
d
easy
to
drink
a
few
of
these
as
they
are
smooth
and
go
down
easy
in
the
end
this
was
a
nice
little
session
quality
scottish
ale
from
abc
i
thought
it
could
have
used
more
smoke
and
a
few
more
roasted
flavors
but
its
fine
where
it
stands
would
i
ever
drink
it
again
id
probably
would
d
easy
drinking
scotch
ale
and
a
nicely
done
example
from
abc
an
easy
transitional
beer
for
new
to
craft
beer
type
friends
to
try
out
this
beer
may
not
land
a
spot
on
my
top
5
favorite
beers
list
but
it
is
surprisingly
good
i
would
definitely
buy
a
sixpack
of
this
again
dont
drink
and
review
notes
from
101204
pours
a
chocolate
brown
with
with
a
small
white
head
that
dissipated
into
the
slightest
of
rings
the
aroma
is
of
caramel
buttery
malt
followed
by
some
wet
wood
aromas
the
taste
is
of
smooth
chocolate
caramel
hint
of
smoke
and
wet
wood
nice
and
malty
the
feel
is
thin
for
a
malty
brew
has
moderate
carbonation
and
finishes
slighty
chewy
and
dry
probably
my
favorite
out
of
the
sampler
12
pack
it
has
nice
malty
flavors
though
it
is
a
tad
thin
d
not
bad
i
wouldnt
turn
one
down
its
not
my
favorite
style
but
its
good
its
a
good
alternative
beer
for
people
who
like
red
or
standard
brown
ales
i
could
down
a
few
d
this
is
a
great
session
ale
smooth
with
a
robust
flavor
that
doesnt
push
you
around
poured
a
medium
brown
with
a
deep
red
tint
it
has
a
thick
fluffy
head
the
smell
is
sweet
and
of
malts
butterscotch
and
a
flowery
sent
the
taste
is
smooth
and
sweet
with
sweet
malts
butterscotch
a
slight
hoppiness
and
a
very
satisfying
after
taste
d
a
nice
combination
of
mouthfeel
and
taste
but
the
burnt
earthy
taste
was
a
little
overbearing
later
a
nice
session
beer
overall
but
i
would
say
that
is
about
it
i
would
not
expect
to
be
pounding
these
back
all
night
d
fairly
good
beer
a
smooth
drinker
but
also
kind
of
filling
dnot
a
bad
take
on
this
style
unique
i
think
that
the
next
time
i
am
at
abc
i
will
order
this
really
one
of
their
better
offerings
d
i
am
not
sure
if
i
will
ever
have
this
beer
again
unless
i
do
the
abc
tour
its
worth
a
try
but
not
worth
the
6pack
buy
pours
a
nice
deep
amber
although
with
very
little
head
and
almost
no
lacing
decent
scent
nothing
deep
or
strong
though
like
im
used
to
but
a
nice
malty
scent
very
stong
malty
taste
as
well
there
really
wasnt
much
in
the
way
of
a
smoky
peatiness
and
the
malty
sweetness
was
almost
too
much
but
only
almost
it
was
still
pretty
good
and
probably
a
good
way
to
get
someone
to
try
a
more
smoky
scotch
or
scotchstyle
ale
in
the
future
it
goes
down
very
easily
as
well
overall
drinkability
ill
rate
as
good
considering
the
taste
its
got
a
nice
flavor
and
the
body
is
heavy
enough
to
make
this
a
bit
harder
to
drink
than
the
average
ive
had
3
at
a
time
and
that
was
about
all
my
belly
could
handle
solid
showing
d
a
nice
change
from
my
norm
but
if
i
had
this
and
nothing
else
id
get
tired
of
the
sweetness
before
too
long
between
the
sourness
and
the
thinness
this
was
okay
with
the
meal
but
nothing
id
seek
out
again
i
got
this
beer
a
while
ago
from
friend
paul
who
brought
it
back
from
out
east
so
its
a
i
bit
old
anyway
it
poured
a
foamy
tan
head
with
gold
highlights
that
acted
like
a
soda
pop
foamed
right
up
and
then
down
to
zero
no
lace
both
aroma
and
flavor
are
caramel
malty
sweet
with
a
hint
of
alcohol
body
is
unremarkable
finish
is
same
way
altogether
forgettable
d
nice
on
a
cold
night
while
not
a
session
beer
for
me
i
found
it
to
be
real
nice
ive
been
drinking
this
beer
for
years
it
seems
to
get
better
as
i
get
older
a
keeper
glowing
burgandy
colored
beer
with
a
short
cream
colored
head
lightly
sweet
caramel
malt
in
the
aroma
along
with
dark
fruits
and
a
hint
of
tea
there
is
a
good
amount
of
dark
malt
in
there
with
hints
of
red
wine
and
cherries
there
is
also
an
overriding
cocoa
flavor
that
while
it
does
not
taste
bad
seems
very
out
of
place
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
almost
watery
scottish
ales
are
typically
quite
drinkable
but
even
so
the
mouthfeel
in
this
one
is
a
bit
lacking
a
good
beer
but
not
a
good
scottish
ale
the
drinkability
is
ok
but
not
on
my
shortlist
to
try
again
mk
do
not
expect
anything
over
the
top
just
an
easy
to
drink
well
crafted
ale
very
well
done
an
everyday
brew
looking
forward
to
the
rest
of
the
12
pack
for
me
this
beer
just
didnt
do
it
faint
aroma
very
mild
flavors
and
thin
mouthfeel
in
fairness
i
did
drink
a
3f
robert
the
bruce
prior
to
this
beer
and
i
really
enjoyed
it
this
beer
may
have
suffered
in
comparison
however
i
have
tried
5
different
beers
by
abc
and
none
of
the
others
have
done
much
for
me
either
this
is
the
last
for
a
while
cheers
a
good
description
it
wasnt
very
hoppy
though
at
all
with
a
smooth
malt
flavor
a
dark
color
and
almost
no
hop
presence
a
nice
beer
to
pair
with
the
food
though
at
abc
im
thinking
about
picking
a
six
of
this
up
for
poker
tomorrow
night
so
of
course
id
drink
it
again
abc
is
a
good
company
that
puts
out
consistantly
good
beers
i
think
it
is
one
of
the
areas
best
kept
secrets
pours
a
dark
amber
with
a
quicklydisappearing
head
smell
is
of
sweet
caramel
and
malt
maybe
a
little
roasted
too
tastes
of
smokey
malt
and
some
caramel
lingers
after
swallowing
thinner
than
other
scotch
ales
ive
had
a
good
occasional
brew
but
not
as
drinkable
as
i
had
hoped
from
the
aroma
on
tap
at
the
abc
abbey
bar
in
harrisburg
over
the
memorial
day
weekend
the
beer
poured
a
amber
color
with
a
thick
white
head
and
slight
lacing
into
a
standard
pint
glass
the
nose
of
the
beer
gave
me
some
hints
of
malty
sweetness
the
taste
was
a
nice
mix
of
caramel
tones
and
malts
very
pleasing
to
the
taste
buds
the
body
is
medium
and
easy
to
drink
by
my
estimation
the
taste
is
fairly
dry
up
front
but
picks
some
sweetness
through
to
the
finish
where
it
is
most
apparent
this
beer
has
a
bit
of
a
phenolic
edge
to
it
that
seems
like
it
might
be
derived
from
a
bit
of
peat
smoked
malt
the
beer
is
actually
pretty
light
on
the
palate
but
it
is
quite
rich
and
flavorful
with
lots
of
malt
character
again
notes
of
toffee
and
caramel
are
prominent
in
the
flavors
but
it
is
not
just
this
some
light
roasted
grain
notes
and
some
interesting
toasted
grain
notes
round
out
a
full
suite
of
malt
character
that
is
a
bit
more
complex
than
i
have
described
drinkability
not
bad
but
i
felt
this
leans
more
towards
a
red
ale
than
anything
else
soso
offering
out
of
the
four
beers
that
came
in
the
sample
pack
i
recieved
from
appalachian
brewing
co
this
is
undoubtedly
the
best
pretty
thin
in
the
mouth
to
the
point
of
almost
tasting
flat
drinkable
but
i
certainly
didnt
order
a
second
pint
a
nice
american
scots
ale
looks
close
to
cherry
coke
with
a
tight
offwhite
head
and
quite
a
bit
of
lacing
smelled
of
carameled
malts
a
ghost
of
smoke
a
hint
of
alcohol
and
some
grassyness
in
there
too
tasted
quite
like
i
thought
from
the
smell
well
rounded
caramel
flaovrs
meet
with
a
slight
bitterness
and
a
hint
of
smoke
decent
and
flavor
full
but
a
tad
thin
in
the
body
but
pretty
drinkable
all
the
same
price
8
for
a
six
pack
not
too
bad
served
from
the
tap
in
a
standard
pint
glass
at
abcs
harrisburg
location
a
deep
red
copper
color
with
a
nice
substantial
head
the
scent
was
malty
with
hints
of
caramel
and
sweetness
flavor
was
malty
and
roasted
with
an
almost
sourdough
bread
taste
and
a
slightly
smokey
element
it
finishes
with
a

which
leaves
with
an
aftertaste
of
the
same
i
picked
up
a
sixtel
of
this
for
the
home
kegerator
the
label
said
it
was
filled
on
62405
the
price
made
this
very
attractive
it
was
a
good
1015
dollars
less
then
the
other
micro
sixtels
at
exton
beverage
it
poured
a
nice
reddishbrown
with
a
12inch
light
tan
head
that
reduced
to
a
collar
quickly
i
didnt
get
a
great
deal
of
aroma
a
sweet
earthy
smell
but
i
had
to
breathe
deep
to
get
it
a
bit
of
sweetness
in
the
beginning
then
ended
with
slight
hop
bitterness
not
much
flavor
good
for
the
style
it
drinks
pretty
easy
has
a
creamy
texture
with
low
carbonation
and
a
dry
finish
the
price
in
a
sixtel
makes
this
a
great
buy
another

sampled

to
my

cousin

this
12
oz
bottle
pours
a
hazy
cola
copper
body
with
a
2
cm
tan
head
that
quickly
drops
to
a
cap
with
good
patchy
lace
lovely
scotch
ale
aroma
with
toffee
and
caramel
maltiness
and
a
hint
of
smoky
peat
mouthfeel
is
nice
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
light
medium
body
taste
is
primarily
toffee
maltiness
with
a
dry
hop
bitterness
for
good
balance
faint
smoky
character
resembles
peat
not
at
all
chewy
as
some
have
noted
body
thins
a
bit
as
it
warms
improving
drinkability
even
finish
with
a
smoky
malt
aftertaste
and
a
note
of
bitter
hops
very
good
drinkability
definitely
worth
a
try
for
fans
of
the
style
presented
as
a
deep
copper
color
with
modest
head
smell
is
very
light
and
nothing
significant
noted
taste
is
very
light
and
not
what
i
would
expect
in
this
style
of
beer
mouthfeel
is
a
slight
sweetness
but
very
restrained
would
be
a
decent
session
beer
but
not
what
i
expect
from
a
scottish
ale
whenever
we
visit
harrisburg
from
atlanta
we
try
to
bring
back
a
few
bottles
as
this
particular
beer
is
not
available
here
drank
2
pints
and
it
was
enough
decent
for
the
style
but
i
remember
this
one
tasting
better
to
me
a
few
years
back
this
brew
is
a
deep
ruby
color
with
a
frothy
brownishtan
head
the
aroma
has
a
pleasing
toasted
grain
and
malt
quality
it
has
lots
of
toasted
nutty
sensations
in
the
aroma
with
less
of
the
syrupy
malt
smells
that
many
scottish
ales
present
very
light
hop
smell
almost
an
afterthought
taste
is
moderately
sweet
moderately
malty
caramel
and
very
faint
smoky
flavors
i
expected
more
sweetness
and
fullness
of
flavor
considering
the
80
shilling
on
the
label
finishes
just
slightly
bitter
wish
a
fleetingly
soapy
sensation
medium
body
this
brew
is
pretty
good
but
not
particularly
inspiring
my
overall
impression
of
this
beer
is
that
it
should
be
labeled
a
marzen
i
mean
seriously
this
one
looks
smells
and
tastes
like
one
weak
example
of
a
scottish
ale
overallquite
an
interesting
beer
certaintly
the
most
interesting
and
flavorful
beer
ive
had
from
appalachian
yet
there
was
something
in
the
taste
that
just
didnt
work
for
me
not
sure
whether
it
was
the
style
of
beer
or
this
particular
one
but
still
an
interesting
beer
that
definitely
warrants
a
try
give
this
one
a
shot
overall
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
scotchscottish
ales
are
one
of
the
styles
i
personally
like
but
for
some
reason
are
not
nearly
as
common
as
other
styles
in
my
area
glad
to
see
a
local
brewery
producing
this
when
i
had
it
i
was
thinking
this
was
a
damn
weak
wee
heavy
but
i
didnt
realize
that
this
was
just
a
regular
everyday
scottish
ale
in
that
case
it
certainly
was
fantastic
and
one
i
wish
to
have
in
the
future
first
sip
average
carbonation
with
a
decently
thick
body
flavor
is
all
caramel
up
front
and
is
all
malt
overall
i
do
get
a
bit
of
a
grainy
biscuit
flavor
on
the
finish
this
brew
is
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
i
will
drink
this
one
again
this
beer
has
very
little
or
no
head
has
a
nice
redtan
color
and
looks
nice
in
the
glass
has
a
faint
smell
of
malt
and
little
hops
i
like
the
taste
it
is
a
mix
of
malt
and
berries
with
a
slight
hop
aftertaste
the
mouth
feel
is
soft
has
a
little
body
but
leaves
a
fresh
clean
feel
all
and
all
this
is
a
beer
i
stop
for
when
i
am
having
more
then
one
drinkability
if
anything
you
could
drink
multiple
jolly
scots
and
not
get
bogged
down
the
problem
is
im
not
sure
youd
really
want
to
i
still
like
the
beer
as
a
whole
but
ive
had
better
examples
of
the
style
id
love
it
if
they
tweaked
this
into
a
weeheavy
and
beefed
the
flavors
up
this
was
a
very
interesting
scottish
ale
i
was
expecting
something
a
little
darker
and
heavier
it
poured
a
ruby
to
dark
brown
color
with
an
offwhite
head
and
lots
of
lacing
the
overwhelming
aroma
is
one
of
maoltiness
with
a
bit
of
hops
underneath
and
a
bit
of
pepperyness
it
is
a
really
flavorful
beer
with
a
nice
balance
of
the
malt
to
the
hops
which
lends
just
a
slight
bitterness
there
was
a
hint
of
carmel
as
if
some
of
the
malt
may
have
been
carmelized
it
was
relatively
fullbodied
with
a
nice
but
not
overwhelming
carbonation
this
one
was
good
from
start
to
finish
which
caused
me
to
want
another
the
jolly
scot
is
a
scottish
ale
that
is
dark
brown
with
a
slightly
reddish
tint
to
it
this
beer
has
no
head
at
all
as
well
as
no
aroma
about
it
at
all
the
malt
is
kind
of
mild
but
hold
nice
and
the
hops
are
just
as
mild
as
the
malt
but
all
blends
well
in
the
end
the
jolly
scot
is
available
year
round
and
it
is
a
tribute
to
the
irish
scottish
german
immigrant
that
founded
the
city
of
harrisburg
where
the
appalachian
brewery
is
located
in
over
all
pretty

nice

maybe
a

and

as
well
theres
a
little
bit
of
a
harshness
on

im
not
sure
if
its
coming
from
indgredients
peat
malt
or
from
a
flaw
its
not
overwhelming
but
not
that
enjoyable
either
some
sweet
malty
tones
are
evident
as
well
and
some
bitterness
that
im
not
assuming
would
be
coming
from
the

hmmmm
this
ones
throwing
me
a
little
nonetheless
its
not
one
of
my
favorites
served
as
part
of
a
sampler
tray
at
their
brewery
i
remember
enjoying
this
beer
from
the
bottle
earlier
in
the
year
and
the
draft
version
didnt
disappoint
either
a
very
light
scotch
ale
indeed
this
version
is
more
hoppy
than
malty
i
think
of
a
malty
beer
when
i
think
of
a
scottish
ale
but
this
tastes
just
fine
nice
fruitiness
in
the
flavor
too
in
itself
this
is
a
very
good
and
easy
drinking
beer
although
i
would
like
to
see
a
ramped
up
version
of
this
beer
maybe
the
jolly
scots
big
brother
or
the
not
so
jolly
scot
hmmm
a
very
well
rounded
scotch
ale
this
stuff
pours
a
dark
red
colour
with
a
small
fizzy
head
the
aromas
are
of
scotch
alcohol
and
heavy
malts
the
taste
is
very
scotchlike
soothing
warm
and
boozy
the
mouthfeel
is
heavy
but
not
overly
heavy
and
the
drinkability
is
damn
good

this
is
an

welldone
version
of
an
80

and
it
might
even
be
too
clean
to
be
considered
authentic
great
drinkability
id
love
to
try
this
cask
conditioned
well
worth
trying
i
was
a
bit
surprised
when
the
barkeep
planted
my
pint
of
jolly
scot
before
me
despite
a
nice
dark
clean
red
hue
it
held
a
very
thin
head
with
practically
no
noticeable
carbonation
there
was
no
apparent
lacing
and
very
little
head
retention
it
looked
nice
but
kind
of
flat
the
smell
was
a
little
more
reassuring
with
a
sweet
malt
and
subtle
hop
hints
the
taste
held
a
pleasing
maltiness
with
a
good
balance
it
was
smooth
and
full
yet
had
an
almost
average
overall
taste
for
a
scottish
ale
the
ale
was
very
active
in
the
mouth
with
a
tingling
prickly
sensation
not
too
full
decent
mouthfeel
all
around
abcs
jolly
scot
is
not
a
bad
scottish
ale
but
i
wasnt
extremely
impressed
id
gladly
down
a
few
of
them
but
would
probably
seek
out
another
scottish
ale
if
in
the
mood
for
the
style
deep
auburn

color
with
a
fairly
thick

as

really
good

slight

bitterness
coming
through
about
midglass
decent
lace
overall
pretty
well
balanced
and
smooth
thin
mouthfeel
but
overall
pretty
drinkable
this
beer
has
a
dark
caramel
nut
color
as
it
reflects
in
the
glass
a
surprisingly
thick
head
that
seems
to
last
it
drags
down
the
glass
as
it
leaves
its
lace
beige
in
color
it
has
a
sweet

aroma
and
a
slight
sweet

flavor
with
hints
of
flower
and
hops
good
beer
enjoy
this
one
and
support
these
guys
if
you
ever
see
them
the
cashier
had
to
practically
vacuum
these
off
before
scanning
them
sad
fate
for
such
a
good
beer
yet
another
solid
brew
from
appalachian
this
is
probably
one
of
my
favorites
from
this
harrisburg
staple
it
is
nice
and
dark
with
a
little
hoppiness
and
a
slightly
sweet
aroma
the
head
is
moderately
thick
and
remains
that
way
for
about
half
the
glass
until
it
gets
lacey
a
very
drinkable
bier
this
is
one
to
try
when
you
have
the
opportunity
to
try
the
brews
from
this

of

was

really
just
an
average
brew
all
the
way
around
not
worth
the
time
or
money
unfortunately
it
is
the
worst
in
the
pack
by
any
means
but
still
not
anything
to
write
home
about
i
see
it
pairing
well
with
bread
pudding
with
rum
sauce
or
the
classic
sweet
potato
pie
it
gets
a
72100
a
well
crafted
brew
but
its
not
something
i
would
go
out
and
buy
one
is
plenty
i
popped
the
cap
and
commenced
another
light
pour
down
the
side
of
the
glass
in
consideration
of
its
age
i
still
got
a
finger
of
dense
lighttan
head
with
great
retention
for
a
cap
as
the
result
color
was
copperybrown
srm

i
thought
that
the
sweet
potatoes
would
give
more
mouth
feel
than
it
had
not
disappointing
just
lighter
than
i
expected
good
beer
though
this
is
almost
as
weird
as
i
wanted
the
sweet
potato
aroma
and
flavor
is
just
subtle
enough
that
it
works
unfortunately
as
a
scottish
ale
this
is
somewhat
lacking
still
entertaining
i
thought
the
beer
looked
a
lot
better
then
it
tasted
picked
up
a
growler
of
this
to
accompany
nfl
conference
championship
day
poured
into
my
mug
color
was
outstanding
mahogany
but
more
red
maybe
not
a
ton
of
head
the
flavor
however
wasnt
great
usually
you
get
more
flavor
out
of
a
scottish
ale
and
this
one
was
lacking
some
hints
of
wood
and
malt
the
flavor
was
similar
somewhat
disappointing
deep
mohagany
with
some
ruby
hues
and
a
tan
head
that
settles
to
a
cap
and
laces
really
well
its
a
pretty
beer
aromas
are
of
toffee
caramel
earth
really
light
citrus
and
a
touch
vegetal
aromas
are
very
muddled
and
really
needed
to
be
focused
on
to
pull
out
taste
follows
with
some
nice
toffee
and
burnt
caramel
notes
a
touch
of
citrus
mid
palate
gives
way
to
an
earthy
and
vegetal
note
in
the
finish
that
i
assume
is
from
the
sweet
potato
not
overly
bitter
and
very
drinkable
medium
body
with
lower
carbonation
and
a
really
nice
creamy
feel
that
coats
the
palate
well
i
cant
say
i
was
over
the
top
with
this
but
i
found
it
enjoyable
all
the
same
overall
i
am
impressed
with
this
i
havent
had
many
sweet
potato
brews
and
this
one
was
pretty
damn
tasty
mahogany
to
dark
copper
body
with
a
sparse
tan

of
caramel
malts
brown
sugar
a
touch
of
spice
a
tad
sweet
finishing
with
a
sharp
hop
bite
no
easily
discernible
yam
flavor
though
i
can
see
it
a
bit
since
im
seeking
it
whatever
o
not
too
much
going
on
in
this
brew
its
an
easy
to
drink
ale
but
was
hoping
to
get
more
of
the
sweet
potato
in
this
one
very
good
taste
but
with
a
little
too
much
front
end
hops
to
taste
for
style
dark
color
satisfying
7

this
is
an
ideal
beer
for
me
as
far
as
scottish
beers
go
great
malt
flavor
overall
not
bad
especially
considering
scottish
ales
are
far
from
my
favorite

feel

utilizes

little
earthy
taste
is
very
peaty
with
a
scotch
whisky
blend
the
sweet
potato
flavor
is
modestly
apparent
backed
by
a
nice
hop
bite
interesting
overall
another
very
drinkable
beer
out
of
the
2014
beer
camp
nice
the
flavor
profile
flows
like
a
spectrum
rather
than
clicks
from
taste
to
taste
very
smooth
sweet
and
easy
to
drink
a
nose
like
my
dorm
room
on
a
sunday
morning
after
a
party
which
wasnt
a
bad
thing
if
youre
a
beer
geek
yay
sweet
potatoes
real
nice
scottish
ale
brewed
with
sweet
potatoes
honestly
i
cant
pull
much
of
them
out
it
really
tastes
like
a
nice
octoberfest
to
me
has
the
perfect
balance
of
flavor
and
a
nice
light
body
overll
i
would
definitely
like
to
see
this
brewed
for
mass
distribution
one
day
pleasing
and
nice
aroma
crisp
bitterness
balances
the
malt
well
o
a
different
scotch
ale
not
as
malty
as
others
of
the
genre
but
with
a
smoother
texture
than
most
overall
i
thought
that
this
beer
was
ok
the
beer
appeared
a
nice
deep
dark
color
that
had
a
very
nice
offwhite
rocky
head
that
was
very
well
retained
the
beer
gave
off
a
nice
sweet
malty
aroma
but
it
was
tough
to
distinguish
any
distinct
part
the
flavor
of
the
beer
was
good
malty
but
like
the
taste
nothing
too
distinctive
the
beer
however
was
nice
and
creamy
and
had
a
good
fell
to
it
with
a
nice
mild
but
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
overall
a
slightly
better
than
average
beer
dark
broom
semiopaque
big
brown
fluffy
head
good
retention
and
nice
lacing
smell
is
vegetal
and
sweet
malt
taste
is
pretty
sweet
malty
with
some
caramel
and
grassy
hop
notes
mouthfeel
was
very
smooth
and
creamy
with
a
nice
bit
of
carbonation
to
add
just
the
right
feel
overall
it
was
ok
but
ive
certainly
had
lot
better
scotch
ales
worth
trying
overall
taste
improves
the
overall
outlook
of
the
brew
with
potato
muddled
caramel
a
nice
creamy
texture
and
some
spice
touch
of
molasses
on
the
finish
and
some
cocoa
spice
smooth
creamy
feel
overall
a
good
blend
of
flavors
interesting
yet
not
really
memorable

b
overall
not
a
bad
beer
to
try
a
different
spin
on
the
scottish
style
overall
a
very
good
beer
but
not
tasting
much
sweet
potato
a
standard
pour
yields
two
plus
fingers
worth
of
rich
voluminous
crisp
medium
khaki
colored
frothy
goodness
really
good
retention
the
color
is
a
medium
to
dark
brown
with
just
a
touch
or
murkiness
mixed
in
a
moderate
bit
of
moderate
paced
carbonation
the
aroma
is
rich
with
sweet
potato
marshmallow
and
toffee
a
hint
of
milk
chocolate
and
brown
sugar
as
well
very
pleasant
aroma
all
the
way
around
the
flavor
is
rich
and
robust
but
a
significant
deviation
from
the
aroma
roasted
malt
coffee
and
peat
materialize
after
not
being
detected
on
the
nose
there
is
actually
a
fairly
potent
hop
bite
especially
by
style
standards
the
end
result
is
a
highly
complex
and
highly
enjoyable
flavor
profile
the
mouthfeel
is
a
tad
bit
thin
and
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
bodied
crisp
with
some
prickly
carbonation
a
rather
enjoyable
beer
this
style
seems
to
be
falling
a
bit
out
of
mainstream
but
it
is
one
that
i
still
greatly
its
brews
like
this
that
remind
what
an
exquisite
style
it
really
is
o
i
liked
the
taste
of
this
one
but
there
was
a
bit
too
much
bitterness
to
this
dont
know
if
it
was
hops
or
sweet
potatoes
strays
from
the
style
just
a
bit
o
interesting
idea
to
use
sweet
potato
and
i
did
taste
more
than
i
expected
still
not
super
impressed
by
this
one
an
okay
beer
but
one
of
the
weaker
beers
in
the
beer
camp
pack
another
solid
offering
from
tge
beer
camp
poured
reddish
brown
with
a
tall
puffy
head
a
little
taste
of
alcohol
compliments
a
slightly
sweet
taste
and
a
nice
malty
finish
very
good
scottish
ale
pretty
drinkable
scotch
ale
with
some
nice
flavor
the
sweet
potato
adds
a
hint
of
uniqueness
although
you
probably
wouldnt
detect
it
if
you
werent
looking
for
it
all
in
all
a
decent
brew
and
worth
trying
if
you
can
get
your
hands
on
it
pours
a
rusty
brown
with
a
medium
off
white
head
aroma
is
of
grains
light
fruity
notes
yeast
and
malt
taste
is
similar
to
aroma
with
a
grainy
slightly
rustic
cooked
vegetable
flavor
with
mild
bitterness
palate
is
a
medium
body
with
good
carbonation
finish
is
sweet
malt
fruity
with
a
rustic
grains
barley
flavor
and
some
bitterness
for
balance
upfront
flavor
is
more
rustic
herbal
vegetable
on
the
back
more
sweet
fruity
mild
scottish
tinge
overall
interesting
not
my
favorite
of
the
sierra
beer
camp
rotation
but
still
good
brew
osn
really
missed
the
mark
on
this
mix
pack
almost
to
the
point
where
another
mess
up
they
are
off
my
list
of
ill
buy
everything
they
make
just
because
enough
complexity
to
provide
interest
definitely
a
unique
idea
of
something
that
i
would
have
said
is
super
weird
to
start
with
the
beer
pours
a
bubbly
slightly
tannish
head
that
dissipates
very
quickly
the
beer
itself
is
a
clear
and
brown
copper
the
beer
smell
has
strong
sweet
and
caramel
notes
with
a
bit
of
the
sweet
potato
the
sweet
potato
is
fairly
distinct
from
the
other
notes
the
hops
are
barely
noticeable
but
give
off
a
floral
aroma
the
taste
has
the
same
notes
but
at
different
strengths
the
hops
are
slightly
stronger
and
the
sweet
potato
is
more
noticeable
and
stands
apart
from
the
rest
of
the
beer
the
malt
and
caramel
notes
are
not
as
strong
as
they
were
in
the
smell
and
are
covered
by
the
sweet
potato
the
change
is
not
bad
but
could
have
been
better
incorporated
even
though
it
still
works
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
heavy
bodied
and
thick
but
light
enough
to
be
smooth
with
the
biting
carbonation
overall
a
decent
beer
and
okay
overall
not
a
very
good
blend
of
flavors
and
very
little
actual
sweet
potato
way
too
sweet
and
candy
like
the
weird
bitterness
doesnt
go
well
with
the
sweet
candy
not
very
enjoyable
another
poorly
done
beer
camp
beer

light
starchy
malt
on
the
nose
with
some
floral
hop
notes
some
lemon
and
tea
leaf
malt
in
the
back
very
smooth
flavor
but
i
dont
get
a
lot
if
sweet
potato
there
is
an
earthy
gourd
like
flavor
but
i
struggle
to
find
it
instead
its
just
a
nice
smooth
malt
like
barley
grain
tea
leaf
and
burnt
toast
some
fruity
hops
lemon
i
think
along
with
a
bit
of
pine
compliment
the
malt
not
an
overly
complex
brew
this
has
a
lot
of
great
flavor
to
make
it
stand
up
against
the
rest
of
the
12
bottle
from
a
mix
pack
from
tipples
pours
deep
orange
then
settles
as
dark
amber
with
a
two
finger
off
white
head
with
some
orange
hue
aroma
of
sweet
malts
and
sn
characteristic
yeast
sweet
caramel
breadiness
flavor
is
sweet
caramel
malts
some
other
interestingly
sweet
notes
that
i
assume
comes
from
the
sweet
potatoes
the
same
characteristic
yeast
or
water
or
something
that
i
get
from
every
sn
beer
black
cherries
bitter
straw
to
balance
medium
bodied
medium
carbonation
slightly
resinous
with
a
dry
finish
this
was
interesting
sort
of
like
a
light
bodied
old
ale
lots
of
flavor
very
dominated
by
the
malts
not
bad
it
is
dark
amber
in
color
w
an
offwhite
head
an
aroma
of
sweet
roasty
maltiness
mixes
well
w
the
campfire
flavor
comes
off
slightly
nutty
sweet
it
also
has
a
breadiness
in
the
mouthfeel
that
finishes
like
caramel
not
super
in
your
face
like
other
scottishirish
ales
overall

i
think
this
beer
is
better
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
the
appearance
is
almost
on
the
next
level
the
smell
is
very
solid
but
not
outstanding
and
the
flavor
is
absolutely
on
par
and
hitting
all
the
right
notes
but
nothing
in
particular
sets
it
apart
that
said
it
all
comes
together
to
make
an
exceptionally
wellintegrated
beer
for
the
style
smoothly
incorporating
the
sweet
potato
which
im
guessing
is
actually
just
a
yam
but
thats
another
conversation
entirely
and
immaterial
to
the
subject
at
hand
very
good
stuff
overall
i
dont
get
much
from
the
sweet
potatoes
but
i
wonder
if
the
abundance
of
sugars
in
them
might
have
boosted
the
alcohol
without
any
buffer
i
dont
want
to
say
it
is
alcoholic
but
for
7
it
does
have
a
bit
of
a
harsh
edge
when
this
combines
with
the
somewhat
medicinal
fruit
flavors
which
grow
with
each
sip
i
appreciate
the
malt
flavors
here
and
they
are
the
best
part
of
the
beer
along
with
the
aroma
to
me
but
it
just
doesnt
end
up
sitting
well
on
the
palate
towards
the
end
mouthfeel
is
clean
and
pleasant
with
light
flavor
and
carbonation
upfront
and
some
light
linger
sweetness
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
but
perhaps
it
is
because
i
also
really
enjoy
sweet
potatoes
one
of
the
more
creative
and
interesting
beers
in
the
box
d
not
the
best
scotch
i
have
had
but
a
solid
offering
in
the
camp
pack
i
like
how
the
sweet
potatoes
are
perceptible
yet
still
in
balance
with
the
base
brew
i
think
a
scotch
style
ale
was
a
good
choice
to
deliver
some
nice
malty
sugars
with
those
starchy
taters
o
not
bad
has
some
unique
elements
that
make
it
interesting
clear
dark
garnet
pour
with
a
small
tan
head
really
nice
light
nice
malt
aroma
flavor
is
mildly
sweet
with
light
caramel
and
spices
upfront
theres
also
a
bit
of
pine
a
little
alcohol
warmth
and
just
a
hint
of
sweet
potato
finishes
with
a
flavor
that
has
earthy
hops
and
light
roasted
malt
a
little
different
but
good
pours
a
deep
amber
with
a
2
finger
tan
head
that
lingers
it
laces
the
glass
nicely
and
legs
run
quickly
down
the
sides
of
the
glass
its
very
sweet
smelling
i
get
a
decent
amount
of
caramel
toffee
and
what
i
think
is
sweet
potato
at
the
very
end
i
wouldnt
know
what
that
smell
was
if
they
didnt
advertise
it
pretty
typical
for
a
scotch
ale
but
a
bit
subdued
the
flavor
is
very
mild
and
not
nearly
as
sweet
as
i
expected
from
the
nose
i
get
some
toasty
notes
at
the
finish
that
are
preceded
some
mild
fruityness
and
toffee
i
dont
think
the
sweet
potato
comes
through
at
all
the
finish
is
fairly
dry
with
a
low
bitterness
medium
body
with
a
low
carbonation
overall
i
am
not
a
fan
of
the
style
and
i
think
the
use
of
the
sweet
potato
was
a
general
miss
o
a
very
nice
surprise
im
generally
not
a
fan
of
scottish
ales
or
sweet
potatoes
but
this
was
very
enjoyable
tastes
sweet
without
being
cloying
with
that
smack
of
caramel
and
a
touch
of
pine
theres
some
green
piney
sticky
hops
contrasting
with
the
sweetness
and
it
all
works
well
this
was
my
first
of
the
beer
camp
beers
off
to
a
great
start
taste
and
mouth
feel
very
dry
and
starchy
a
bit
of
a
honey
taste
with
an
odd
root
beer
note
at
times
plum
notes
easy
to
drink
for
the
7
abv
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
one
id
look
for
in
a
six
pack
o
id
say
of
all
the
collaborative
efforts
in
this
years
camp
i
was
probably
most
leery
of
this
offering
it
was
actually
quite
enjoyable
glad
to
have
tried
it
overall
it
is
good
not
a
big
fan
of
scottish
ale
but
this
twist
on
it
was
g
oodm
not
a
ton
going
on
beer
was
solid
but
not
what
i
expect
from
a
scotch
ale
didnt
have
a
ton
of
malt
to
it
bottle
poured
a
deep
caramel
color
ale
with
a
medium
size
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
light
lacing
aroma
of
toffee
is
wellbalanced
against
the
sweet
potato
notes
with
light
spices
notes
taste
is
also
dominated
by
sweet
potato
notes
with
some
semisweet
caramel
malt
notes
with
light
spices
also
noticeable
body
is
about
average
with
good
carbonation
and
no
apparent
alcohol
very
well
balanced
mix
between
sweet
potato
light
spices
and
a
scotch
ale
as
for
the
potatoes
i
absolutely
would
not
have
tasted
them
had
the
beers
name
and
label
not
prompted
me
to
the
very
back
end
has
some
complexity
to
it
that
kind
of
tastes
like
yams
i
guess
although
im
probably
just
projecting
that
flavor
onto
it
overall
not
bad
and
by
far
not
the
worst
sweet
potato
beer
i
have
had
overall
decent
beer
overall
i
dont
get
any
sweet
potato
notes
from
the
the
aroma
or
flavor
which
was
a
little
disappointing
its
worth
trying
but
there
are
definitely
better
beers
available
in
the
style
fairly
light
and
easy
drinking
bunt
kind
of
lackluster
for
the
style
carbonation
seemed
a
bit
too
high
when
fresh
but
was
just
right
a
few
months
later
crisp
from
start
tot
finish
and
a
hearty
aftertaste
easy
to
drink
beer
overall
this
ale
has
character
a
pleasant
enough
taste
and
a
good
story
the
asheville
brewers
alliance
and
sierra
nevada
are
pushing
the
envelope
here
and
it
works
poured
into
a
sierra
nevada
pint
glass
with
a
1
of
light
khaki
head
that
left
a
solid
lacing
beer
is
a
mahogany
brown
very
good
looking
toasty
sweet
malty
smell
with
a
alcohol
hint
for
a
scotch
ale
it
had
a
good
slight
hop
taste
but
lacking
the
scotch
ale
taste
for
the
most
part
taste
like
a
mix
between
a
pale
ale
and
a
scottish
ale
has
a
carmel
malty
taste
and
once
it
starts
warming
up
i
start
tasting
the
sweet
potato
fairly
smooth
creamy
beer
with
the
perfect
amount
of
light
carbonation
i
think
its
a
pretty
good
tasty
beer
but
just
wish
it
had
more
of
the
scottish
ale
taste
overall
good
beer
personally
i
would
prefer
more
kettle
caramelization
the
sweetness
would
have
done
well
with
the
earthy
sweet
potato

with

nice

the
taters
coming
in
a
close
second
and
yes
it
is

theres
no
doubt
that
this
is
a
scotish
ale
this
beer
along
with
the
others
in
this

camp
offering
hits
the

on

i
want
more

is
mild
the
aroma
was
good
at
first
pour
but
was
hard
to
decipher
after
starting
to
drink
there
was
a
mildly
boozy
sweet
aroma
some
caramel
possible
sweet
potato
smooth
caramel
malty
taste
with
sweet
potato
at
the
end
and

mild
bitterness
the
beer
is
actually
tasty
i
just
wish
there
was
a
little
more
of
a
hop
bitterness
to
it
not
very
strong
for
a
scottish
ale
either
fantastic
really
wish
this
one
wasnt
a
oneoff
interesting
and
enjoyable
sweet
potato
flavor
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
definitely
a
solid
maltforward
entry
its
sweet
but
not
overly
so
and
balances
the
flavors
nicely
in
an
approachable
package
id
definitely
order
this
at
a
bar
if
it
were
available
overall
a
nice

unbroken
record
of
good
brews
so
far
in

across

rich
and
sweet
again
with
elements
of
earthiness
and
a
pleasing
hint
of
bitterness
i
didnt
detect
much
of
the
sweet
potatoes
used
in
the
mash
here

of
lacing
smells
sweet
some
caramel
toffee
and
maple
more
of
the
same
is
the
taste
easy
drinking
smooth
mouthfeel
slightly
nutty
taste
as
well
low
level
bitterness
just
enough
to
balance
out
the
sweetness
i
cant
pick
out
the
sweet
potatoes
but
im
sure
its
adding
to
the
sweetness
nice
straightforward
ale
with
no
flaws
a
good
brew
different
than
really
anything
else
i
have
had
not
sure
i
would
have
a
lot
more
of
them
but
glad
to
experience
it
o
the
sweet
potatoes
add
some
nice
body
to
the
brew
and
thicken
it
up
a
little
the
herbal
and
floral
notes
work
very
well
with
the
light
roast
and
nutchocolate
combo
definitely
a
different
brew
but
a
nice
change
of
pace
and
welcome
addition
to
the
12pack
poured
into
a
macandrews
thistle
glass
pours
a
dark
hazy
mahogany
brown
with
a
half
finger
khaki
head
with
good
retention
and
lacing
aroma
of
caramel
malt
an
earthy
sweet
smell
that
does
resemble
sweet
potato
hints
of
vanilla
and
peat
flavor
is
interesting
earthy
malt
mild
toasted
malt
sweet
potato
coffee
finishes
with
light
grassy
hops
and
mild
biscuit
malt
with
a
faint
peat
component
medium
bodied
with
mild
carbonation
a
rather
subdued
scottish
ale
with
light
malt
flavors
little
smokiness
redeemed
by
the
interesting
sweet
potato
taste
this
would
have
been
kind
of
boring
without
that
novelty
a
pleasant
enough
mild
scottish
ale
that
could
have
used
some
more
intense
character
one
of
the
beers
from
the
pack
i
was
looking
forward
to
but
its
not
my
favorite
overall
a
pretty
decent
take
on
a
scotch
ale
lighter
but
has
some
nice
toasty
malt
notes
like
the
sweet
potato
qualities
but
i
feel
the
scotch
ale
portion
has
more
yo
be
desired
less
hops
and
more
malts
would
help
i
wonder
if
they
mashed
too
high
or
used
a
super
attenuative
yeast
strain
overall
really
great
dessert
beer
that
isnt
overly
sweet
or
cloying
really
great
flavors
i
would
definitely
drink
this
again
if
i
could
i
like
this
i
always
liked
this
style
sweet
caramel
overtones
with
an
earthy
finish
wonderful
mouthfeel
with
the
proper
dark
ruby
colors
again
id
dial
back
the
carbonation
to
allow
the
sweet
potato
to
further
accentuate
the
overall
flavor
sierra

o
another
winner
from
the
beer
camp
box
i
bet
this
would
go
well
with
a
scoop
if
vanilla
ice
cream
or
a
chocolate
chip
cookie
solid
offering
could
have
been
a
bit
richer
and
sweeter
but
overall
very
enjoyable
o
a
surprisingly
enjoyable
beer
overall
nicely
balanced
and
hearty
i
was
not
expecting
this
to
be
among
my
favorites
of
the
12
pack
overall
i
dont
get
any
sweet
potato
just
an
ok
scottish
12oz
bottle
pours
a
dark
brown
with
ruby
hues
and
a
14
inch
of
head
moderate
amount
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
earthy
with
some
caramel
booze
peat
and
bread
earthy
taste
as
well
starts
with
the
peat
and
caramel
followed
by
some
warming
alcohol
not
getting
much
of
the
sweet
potatoes
but
it
is
a
pretty
earthy
tasting
beer
so
maybe
its
in
the
mix
ends
slightly
sweet
with
a
boozey
malty
finish
medium
bodied
with
a
bit
of
a
slick
mouthfeel
overall
nothing
special
but
a
decent
scottish
ale
none
the
less
overall
a
decent
vegetablefruit
beer
overall
but
nothing
totally
out
of
this
world
one
to
certainly
try
if
you
get
the
chance
but
not
one
to
go
too
far
out
of
your
way
for
served
in
a
mug
overall
left
me
flat
aroma
was
hard
to
get
past
i
mean
when
they
put
ipa
on
the
label
i
know
what
i
am
getting
and
snpa
is
of
course
another
ipa
but
geez
you
guys
really
need
some
who
knows
how
to
make
a
balanced
beer
to
come
there
and
school
yea
yuck
this
is
another
meh
beer
i
am
not
generally
a
fan
of
wee
heavy
beers
and
this
one
was
no
letdown
in
that
department
i
was
hoping
for
a
better
beer
and
because
it
was
a
collaboration
from
my
home
region
i
will
probably
give
it
more
than
it
deserves
but
it
was
an
average
beer
at
best
truthfully
old
chub
is
a
better
representation
of
the
style
and
i
much
prefer
the
new
nitro
version
of
that
over
this
it
was
worth
giving
a
try
but
it
was
about
as
i
expected
not
much
i
will
say
that
i
was
not
expecting
the
amount
of
hop
bitterness
going
on
in
this
beer
not
that
it
really
has
any
hops
in
it
to
speak
of
but
it
was
more
bitter
than
i
was
expecting
which
gave
it
more
balance
than
most
in
the
style
overall
a
really
fun
scottish
ale
i
definitely
enjoyed
this
one
i
liked
that
it
was
overly
smokeypeaty
overall
a
nice
enough
beer
but
not
one
that
would
have
me
rushing
out
to
buy
again
as
with
chico
king
im
afraid
this
one
might
be
the
victim
of
high
expectations
on
my
part
at
least
this
time
the
expectations
came
from
my
own
fondness
for
sweet
potato
and
scottish
ales
rather
than
a
boastful
label
from
the
12
oz
bottle
as
part
of
the
2014
beer
camp
box
purchased
at
litickers
liquor
in
ocean
beach
this
is
about
my
favorite
of
the
overhopped
litter
o
this
was
very
easy
drinking
for
a
scottish
ale
i
expecting
a
sweeter
less
hoppy
flavor
but
good
nonetheless
the
body
was
much
thinner
than
i
like
in
the
style
and
finished
semidry
drinkability
was
ok
the
beer
went
down
easily
enough
but
wasnt
particularly
notable
overall
a
pleasant
enough
brew
but
1
was
certainly
enough
for
me
ymmv
mediumdry
to
close
the
beers
sweetness
and
rich
textures
are
persistent
and
the
beer
squimishly
develops
the
complex
dryness
of
authentic
versions
its
light
warmth
is
accompanied
by
mild
evergreen
and
rye
bite
in
a
longlasting
finish
a
tasty
easy
drinking
scotch
ale
o
more
hopped
up
and
less
sweet
than
i
was
expecting
but
pretty
good
nonetheless
interesting
use
of
sweet
potato
i
liked
that
aspect
of
the
flavor
overall
boring
beer
nothing
special
complex
or
unique
right
on
par
for
a
brown
ale
part
of
the
beer
camp
compilation
collaboration
between
sierra
nevada
and
asheville
breweng
alliance
pours
a
clear
dark
amber
color
with
ample
head
has
that
brown
sugar
nose
with
a
hint
of
a
vegetal
component
im
guessing
that
is
the
sweet
potatoes
coming
through
really
smooth
scotch
ale
dark
and
malty
with
that
nice
balanced
sweet
potato
coming
through
this
isnt
a
belhaven
scotch
ale
but
its
a
pretty
good
representation
of
the
style
a
little
lighter
than
expected
though
overall
its
quite
drinkable
with
no
real
off
flavors
another
win
for
beer
camp
o
ive
had
scotch
ales
but
apparently
never
a
scottish
ale
compared
to
those
this
was
lighter
in
feel
drier
milder
more
subdued
and
lowkey
the
feel
and
weight
were
not
unlike
some
english
ales
ive
had
but
with
a
woodsier
earthier
flavor
profile
a
good
drink
but
not
typical
of
what
i
return
to
o
ya
know
what
i
was
expecting
more
there
not
much
depth
of
flavor
in
here
and
it
seems
a
little
light
there
is
a
bitterness
in
here
that
im
not
really
digging
either
i
think
that
plays
a
part
in
the
harshness
i
was
speaking
of
probably
one
of
my
least
favorite
from
the
camp
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
i
dont
usually
try
too
may
scottish
ales
but
i
can
tell
that
tater
ridge
has
a
lot
of
originality
to
it
it
smells
sweet
with
notes
of
mocha
hazelnut
and
bread
its
not
a
potent
aroma
more
subtle
and
i
really
like
that
about
it
the
taste
fully
lives
up
to
its
aroma
as
well
it
is
rich
with
hazelnut
fig
dark
chocolate
and
a
wonderful
sweetness
that
brightens
it
up
and
ties
it
all
together
i
would
definitely
buy
this
in
a
six
pack
when
it
starts
getting
cold
outside
o
not
a
bad
beer
but
im
also
not
digging
it
at
all
i
dont
think
the
sweet
potatoes
were
a
good
idea
this
is
the
first
one
i
didnt
like
in
the
beer
camp
across
america
box
o
i
thought
this
was
a
pretty
enjoyable
brew
it
had
a
lot
of
similar
flavors
to
other
scottish
ales
but
has
some
notes
of
a
happoshu
due
to
the
fairly
moderate
amount
of
sweet
potato
presence
in
the
flavoraroma
i
would
grab
this
one
again
easy
to
drink
and
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
o
the
sweet
potatoes
make
this
beer
unique
but
it
doesnt
taste
much
compared
to
other
scottish
ales
and
seems
like
it
could
have
been
maltier
o
this
is
definitely
towards
the
end
of
the
bunch

me

and
very

a

offering
the
verdict
i
like
it
im
not
a
yam
eater
but
i
approached
this
with
an
open
mind
and
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
how
well
it
came
out
this
is
by
far
the
best
sweet
potato
brew
ive
ever
had
its
also
the
only
sweet
potato
brew
ive
ever
had
very
smooth
scottish
ale
with
a
unique
twist
o
this
could
be
a
nice
sweet
potato
scotch
ale
if
it
werent
so
damn
hopped
up
o
a
touch
sweet
simple
i
would
prefer
a
bit
more
dry
malt
and
a
kiss
of
hops
overall
it
is
enjoyable
but
it
just
does
not
remind
me
of
a
scottish
ale
and
is
really
missing
the
toasty
and
caramel
notes
i
associate
with
this
style
overall
experience
ive
stated
much
more
pleasant
than
i
anticipated
i
cant
wait
to
try
new
beers
from
the
mills
creek
sierra
nevadaeventually
a
pilgrimage
to
tour
asheville
vibrant
brewing
scene
overall
good
beer
i
dont
get
sweet
potato
but
i
like
the
overall
profile
of
the
beer
somewhere
between
american
porter
and
hoppy
amber
ale
overall
another
home
run
from
the
beer
camp
collaboration
pack
i
have
been
throughly
impressed
by
a
number
of
beers
and
this
one
wins
most
unique
bitter
and
malty
with
a
light
piney
hop
presence
its
a
little
bit
astringent
which
detracts
some
vague
dried
currant
dry
wood
maple
lingering
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
overall
a
little
bit
lacking
the
sweet
potato
doesnt
really
come
through
and
the
astringency
isnt
a
positive
either
despite
its
flaws
i
still
finished
it
no
problem
onot
my
style
flavor
is
better
than
the
aroma
which
is
always
a
good
thing
a
beer
brewed
for
a
specific
consumer
not
me
o
a
very
american
take
on
a
scottish
ale
the
more
heavyhanded
use
of
hops
for
the
style
is
welcome
as
it
wouldve
gone
cloying
without
it
as
it
stands
it
still
toes
that
line
the
sweet
potatoes
would
have
almost
certainly
been
overlooked
were
it
not
for
knowing
they
were
there
the
sweet
and
earthy
flavors
blend
right
in
with
the
base
beer
o
i
enjoyed
this
its
not
the
scottish
ale
flavor
i
expected
its
got
a
characteristic
sierra
nevada
malt
profile
that
i
quite
like
with
a
twist
of
some
cherry
and
spice
that
works
dont
expect
much
sweet
potato
though
not
a
very
characterful
brew
the
sweet
potato
shows
up
in
aroma
but
not
flavor
o
an
enjoyable
brew
and
another
solid
but
somewhat
less
then
stellar
beer
in
the
beer
camp
series
and
now
i
am
off
to
find
me
some
sweet
taters
poured
ontap
at
a
beer
camp
tap
takeover
the
beer
was
served
in
a
shaker
pint
the
beer
was
a
crystal
clear
rubyblood
coloring
with
a
dense
frothy
clingy
cream
colored
head
nose
of
rich
caramel
earthy
notes
and
subtle
floral
highlights
favors
are
earthy
and
sweet
forward
with
scotch
notes
caramel
candy
sugar
thistle
and
subtle
bitter
characteristics
smooth
and
midbodied
with
a
tangy
richly
sweet
aftertaste
smooth
finish
this
beer
was
a
nice
drinker
with
very
decent
flavors
coming
off
of
those
sweet
potatoes
sweet
potatoes
in
this
style
is
all
in
all
pretty
genius
stuff
a
great
intro
for
me
into
the
beer
camp
across
america
series
my
fourth
brew
today
from
the
beer
camp
12
pack
the
color
is
amazing
dark
plum
i
took
a
picture
of
it
and
sent
it
round
to
my
friends
it
smells
like
a
belgian
super
sweet
with
some
dark
fruit
notes
but
it
lacks
the
malt
backbone
required
for
the
style
it
tastes
interesting
again
like
it
wants
to
be
a
belgian
i
dont
get
sweet
potato
from
it
but
i
do
get
sweet
like
cotton
candy
sweet
still
theres
a
lot
here
to
be
admired
and
ill
freely
admit
to
an
afternoon
of
drinking
if
you
get
a
chance
definitely
try
this
ill
review
it
again
my
second
time
round
picking
up
a
second
box
tomorrow
o
its
good
but
nothing
special
if
you
like
this
style
founders
dirty
bastard
is
the
way
to
go
o
i
find
this
to
be
a
very
good
scotch
ale
its
a
little
lighter
than
some
with
far
less
stone
fruit
qualities
and
overall
heft
than
most
but
it
has
an
excellent
toasted
grain
quality
that
is
at
once
savory
and
refreshing
a
hearty
and
enjoyable
experience
the
taste
has
a
dash
of
sweet
malts
bit
the
hop
bitterness
expresses
itself
like
a
waterfall
crashing
into
the
river
below
almost
syrupy
i
have
a
few
more
of
these
beer
camps
to
go
through
but
regretfully
this
is
my
least
favorite
of
an
otherwise
impressive
set
its
okay
nothing
really
stands
out
in
this

get
right
typically
diggin
it
keep
em
coming
mouthfeel
is
very
thick
and
creamy
with
a
somehow
dry
finish
overall
this
is
pretty
good
overall
pssh
this
has
to
be
a
joke
a
good
baseline
for
the
style
especially
the
american
version
i
expect
this
to
be
a
trend
i
am
surprised
to
see
this
rated
as
poorly
as
it
is
on
here
i
think
its
one
of
the
more
inventive
and
well
executed
beers
in
the
box
maybe
the
only
memorable
one
for
me
so
far
just
a
few
bottles
left
to
try
nice
yammy
color
really
orange
glowing
and
clear
short
of
a
brown
ale
but
moving
toward
that
hue
head
is
bubbly
and
off
white
and
it
sticks
around
smell
and
taste
are
similar
big
earthy
sweetness
at
first
i
really
do
get
the
potato
with
some
honey
or
candy
in
there
too
it
reminds
me
of
the
marshmallow
sweet
potatoes
on
thanksgiving
has
that
feel
hints
of
roast
from
the
malt
but
its
too
clean
and
light
to
fall
into
a
brown
ale
category
real
neatly
i
dig
the
finish
too
earthy
again
really
different
with
a
unique
sweetness
more
molasses
this
time
well
integrated
flavors
in
this
one
and
just
a
really
creative
beer
not
starchy
at
all
in
feel
quite
tidy
really
and
clean
for
the
sugars
in
here
bubbles
are
dialed
right
in
and
while
the
body
may
be
just
a
little
thin
for
a
real
fall
ready
brew
i
like
this
a
lot
in
that
context
and
would
love
to
see
it
make
a
return
for
the
season
highlight
of
the
box
for
me
so
far
maybe
i
think
its
a
lovely
brew
and
could
drink
this
all
fallwinter
long
o
many
of
the
beers
in
this
12pack
have
suffered
from
a
slightly
excessive
amount
of
alcohol
presence
and
while
this
one
is
no
different
its
more
manageable
than
others
either
way
its
tasty
and
worthy
of
representing
asheville
beer
this
poured
out
a
dark
rubyamber
color
with
a
substantial
34ths
inch
head
that
shows
no
signs
of
fading
away
aroma
is
a
bit
lacking
with
some
light
sweet
maltvery
light
on
first
taste
theres
more
bitterness
than
i
expected
but
it
doesnt
get
in
the
way
of
the
essential
maltiness
which
gives
medium
caramel
notes
theres
really
not
much
else
here
and
the
finish
is
rather
dry
not
very
tostyle
i
dont
know
what
the
sweet
potatoes
contribute
but
i
cant
taste
any
at
all
it
does
have
a
nice
creamy
body
but
otherwise
this
is
just
a
goodlooking
pretty
generic
beer
pours
a
hazy
dark
copper
with
a
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
partial
film
on
top
of
the
beer
thick
rings
of
lace
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
toasted
malt
caramel
earth
and
slight
citrus
zest
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
malt
earth
toast
and
citrus
zest
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
has
earthy
qualities
but
i
am
not
getting
anything
that
i
could
consider
sweet
potato
like
o
an
interesting
take
on
a
scottish
ale
but
overall
it
fell
a
little
too
far
on
the
sweet
side
for
my
tastes
overall
a
pretty
good
scottish
ale
i
cant
say
as
i
can
identify
the
sweet
potato
elements
readily
but
its
still
a
good
beer
i
probably
would
enjoy
this
beer
more
in
the
winter
and
not
when
its
90
degrees
outside
overall
fairly
sweet
but
tasty
and
certainly
within
my
expectations
for
a
solid
scotch
ale
pours
into
my
isle
of
arran
glass
a
deep
rich
amber
with
a
full
one
and
a
half
finger
off
white
head
that
slowly
settles
into
a
frothy
mass
leaving
broken
chunks
of
lace
as
it
does
some
spiced
sweet
potatoes
show
thru
in
the
nose
along
with
some
brown
sugar
and
malty
cakiness
not
overly
sweet
on
the
palate
with
sweet
potatoes
being
quite
noticeable
in
the
back
endpretty
rich
in
maltiness
i
think
i
like
this
a
little
more
than
mostit
has
subtle
nuances
that
i
catcha
good
beer
malty
with
no
real
sweet
potato
coming
through
i
do
taste
some
additional
spices
its
tasty
anyway
overall
nice
brew
and
it
fits
well
within
the
scotch
style

said

just
adds
a
slight
sweetness

creamy
taste
overall
a
great
beer
one
of

in

i
was
surprised
by
this
one

am
so
looking

to
the

camps
this
is
my
first
of
this
years
batch
i
picked
up
two
12s
overall
4
0
great
beer
and
certainly
one
of
the
best
so
far
from
the
12
pack
they
nailed
the
style
but
more
importantly
they
produced
a
beer
that
is
outstanding
and
well
worth
a
try
maybe
a
little
goofy
but
those
darned
taters
contributed
positively
to
the
taste
of
the
brew
i
recommend
this
brew
i
enjoyed
this
quite
a
bit
glad
i
have
a
few
more
to
sip
wow
a
very
interesting
take
on
a
scottish
ale
made
with
sweet
potatoes
from
north
carolina
the
appearance
was
dark
brown
with
a
bit
of
a
haze
and
a
tan
foam
that
left
nice
trails
down
the
glass
the
smell
was
sweet
but
mostly
malt
the
taste
was
similar
in
that
there
was
a
lot
of
amazing
malt
flavors
but
you
could
still
get
hints
of
the
sweet
potatoes
on
the
end
reminded
me
of
thanksgiving
also
the
mouthfeel
was
full
but
not
overly
thick
really
enjoyed
this
one
and
made
me
excited
for
the
next
eleven
out
of
this
years
beer
camp
translucent
brown
pour
with
a
ruby
cast
a
skien
of
khaki
foam
smells
sweet
and
malty
taste
is
malty
lightly
sweet
almost
cola
like
a
very
light
washing
of
bitter
keeps
sweetness
from
being
cloying
i
suppose
there
is
a
shadow
of
yams
in
here
at
least
i
think
im
getting
something
body
is
medium
light
mildly
carbonated
this
is
an
average
scottish
ale
maybe
with
sweet
potatoes
but
i
cant
be
sure
decent
overall
this
is
a
nice
scotch
ale
but
the
sweet
potatoes
are
barely
noticeable
o
overall
one
of
the
best
brownscottish
ales
ive
ever
had
which
isnt
really
saying
much
the
beer
is
akin
to
a
highly
refined
newcastle
or
honey
brown
that
isnt
overpoweringly
sweet
and
packs
a
respectable
amount
of
abv
in
the
punch
if
your
expecting
a
delicious
sweet
potato
beer
you
will
be
disappointed
if
you
are
of
the
rare
few
that
love
scottish
ales
im
sure
youll
enjoy
this
one
overall
above
average
to
good
beer
a
survey
of
the
ratings
have
shown
this
to
be
the
lowest
among
the
beer
camp
12
that
is
a
very
good
sign
for
the
rest
of
the
beers
in
the
box
an
okay
representation
of
the
style
i
would
probably
classify
this
is
a
fruitvegetable
beer
rather
than
a
scottish
ale
o
interesting
but
not
stylistically
appropriate
or
obviously
tasty
excellent

get
in

my
favorite
ale
of
all
time
very
smooth

nutty
with
a
hint
of
banana
bread
and
just
the
right
amount

carbonation

this
one
is
better
than
the
sum

its
parts
i
feel
like
it
is
just
average
on
each
rating
but
the
overall
seems
to
be
above
average
i
dont
think
id
seek
it
out

i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
would
drink
it
again

this

for

to
which
i
compare

i
was
a

let

due
to
where
i
got
it
from
if
you
like

with
a
scottish

twist
i
definitely
recommend
overall
i
thought
this
was
ok

there
was
something
about

is

beer
that
i
cant
wait
to
try

well
against

good

decent
standardish

seems
kind
of
like
the

it
pours
dark

with
a
nominal
foamy

and
smells
good
unfortunately
none
of
that
goodness
translates
into
taste
was
at
phils
liqour
and
the
owner
suggested
this
beer
after
i
told
him
what
i
was
looking
for
in
a
beer
this
warm
sunday
afternoon
the
guy
never
steered
me
wrong
before
so
this
is
what
i
got
it
was
a
copper
colored
ale
in
a
stout
looking
clear
bottle
poured
into
a
sierra
nevada
hop
tulip
it
poured
with
a
very
creamy
looking
1
head
which
steadily
receded
to
about
a
quarter
inch
smells
for
the
glass
are
nuts
bread
dough
and
a
smell
i
cannot
identify
first
impressions
on
taste
are
exactly
as
it
smells
pleasant
pleasing
and
leaving
a
very
slight
sourness
that
lingers
on
the
palate
with
just
a
touch
of
bitterness
balancing
it
out
halfway
down
the
beer
i
come
to
a
conclusion
this
beer
is
lower
in
alcohol
not
a
ton
of
flavors
and
nothing
fancy
about
it
but
in
a
good
way
like
an
old
tree
that
has
taken
ages
to
attain
a
good
form
it
reflects
simplistic
beauty
these
beers
subtly
lull
you
into
spending
an
afternoon
drinking
and
enjoying
good
beers
without
getting
hammered
a
beer
that
could
appeal
to
even
those
who
are
not
beer
enthusiasts
as
well
a
solid
b
to
the
folks
who
made
this
beer
if
it
wasnt
12
a
six
pack
i
would
put
it
into
the
regular
rotation
but
this
will
be
a
once
in
a
while
relaxing

now

one

that
i
didnt
care

for
ultimately
before

try

i
am

i
did

is

with
the
malts
still
being
the
first
to
show
up
and
they
impart
the
same
aspects
that
they
did
in
the
aroma
with
the
caramel
seeming
to
stick
out
the
most
this
time
and
it
still
has
a
light
smokey
aspect
to
it
up
next
comes
the
fruity
yeast
which
seems
to
be
just
a
little
lighter
than
it
was
in
the
aroma
and
theres
also
just
a
slight
skunky
flavor
on
the
finish
theres
not
bitterness
with
a
little
more
sweetness
taking
it
place
with
just
a
slight
earthy

flavors
and
theres
some
smokey
and
caramel

like
flavors
in

aftertaste
this
was
a
pretty

beer

believes
that
when
in
a
scottishstyle
pub
do
as
the
scots
do
and
drink
up
some
belhaven
namely
the
scottish
ale
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
brass
topped
by
a
finger
of
lightly
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
sweet
biscuit
light
powdered
sugar
mild
grass
light
flowers
toasted
caramel
and
hard
water
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
along
with
a
tiny
twinge
of
vague
fruit
this
time
more
powerful
than
in
the
lager
but
still
barely
there
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
fluid
feel
overall
a
nice
malty
british
ale
one
that
went
pretty
well
with
the
chips
wish
it
were
a
little
lower
alcohol
so
you
could
drink
more
of
it

getting

i
am
so
glad
they
have
this
in
the

can
highly
recommend
i
really
love
this
beer
from
a
can
i
got
a
nitro
keg
for
home
and
its
even
better
you
can
down
2
pints
before
you
even
know
it
it
super
smooth
wow
nitro
is
amazing
with
all
that
being
said
its
an
excellent
beer
anyway
you
have
it
one
of
my
top
5
many
have
explained
it
feel
and
flavor
already
much
better
than
i
can
if
you
have
the
chance
get
it
on
tap
if
not
in
bottles
or
cans
its
still
darn
good
overall
very
good
but
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
unusual
easily
drinkable
smooth
delicious
just
great
tobacco
and
raisins
im
not
saying
that
is
a
bad
thing
the
taste
is
sweet
but
bitter
nothing
overpowering
but
it
has
a
bitter
aftertaste
this
brew
is
something
i
would
get
again
if
i
was
having
a
nice
dinner
im
giving
this
brew

of

o
very
clean
and
fresh
tasting
with
some
slight
estery
flavors
and
low
on
the

flavors
with
this
scottish
ale
well
done
and
easy
to
drink
i
would
get
this
again
good
toasted
malt
backbone
excellent
specialty
characters
of
smoke
the
nuttiness
matches
the
slight
sweetness
well
and
the
finish
is
dry
enough
to
be
refreshing
albeit
a
touch
too
bitter

my
liking

and
a
bit
of

at
the

is
tingly
with
carbonation
and
a
little
creamy

not
much

this
is
a

it
is
at

a
very

belhaven

i

would
be
a
dream
on

it

a

peataccented
definitively
scottish
ale
that
is
very
understated
but
enjoyable
it
is
exactly
the
kind
of
offering
from
one
of
the
breweries
that
first
turned
me
off
of
commercial
beer
and
onto
better

engaging

belhaven
is
hard
to
beat
on

if
drinking
from
the

i
have
found
it
is
best
poured
into
a
frosty
pint
glass
im
sure
the
draught
can
is
fantastic
but
i
havent
been
able
to
find
it
on
the
shelf
yet
the
best
scottish
ale
i
have
tried
so
far
an
outstanding
beer
disappointed
after
drinking
belgian
trappiste
ales
this
does
not
compare
had
it
on
tap
and
it
seemed
to
taste
a
lot
better
was
expecting
better
quality
what
a
let
down
i
was
expecting
better
beer
after
i
had
it
on
tap
a
few
years
ago
it
was
not
bad
but
could
be
better
overall
impression
a
fine
beer
although
it
seems
to
diverge
from
the
scottish
ale
style
seems
to
be
more
of
a
northern
english
brown
to
me
but
a
good
one
at
that
would
have
liked
to
have
tasted
more
evidence
of
kettle
caramelization
and
less
hop
bitterness
so
that
some
of
the
other
flavors
could
come
out
a
bit
more
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
a
particularly
good
one
either
some
of
its
aspects
are
off
the
charts
appearance
and
mouthfeel
while
the
others
are
pretty
average
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
while
its
certainly
malt
forward
i
found
great
balance
in
the
flavor
and
mouthfeel
wasnt
too
aggressive
hitting
in
all
the
right
spots
will
i
buy
this
beer
again
hell
yes
i
like
a
good
scottish
ale
and
this
is
in
line
with
the
model
for
the
style
the
beer
of
my
house
is
now
under
the
belhaven
flag
im
a
big
fan
of
this
beer
and
couldnt
speak
more
highly
of
it
its
a
sweet
smooth
ale
that
doesnt
get
disgusting
as
you
drink
more
of
it
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
its
quality
through
and
through
overall
overall
a
good
beer
i
like
malty
beers
but
more
roasted
malts
i
e
in
porters
stouts
than
this
kind
of
stuff
the
very
skunky
smell
originally
present
leads
to
the
biggest
downgrade
in
rating
probably
much
better
from
a
can
o
a
pretty
bland
beer
in
my
opinion
really
didnt
taste
like
other
scottish
ales
i
have
had
although
this
is
the
first
one
i
have
had
from
scotland
i
thought
this
beer
was
pretty
underwhelming
and
reminded
me
of
lessflavorful
versions
of
some
british
bitters
and
esbs
that
i
have
had
aroma
taste
not
an
overpowering
nose
some
malty
and
roasted
nut
notes
has
a
slight
chocolate
taste
to
it
overall
this
beer
is
similar
in
taste
and
style
to
a
guinness
overall
good
but
on
the
milder
and
less
complex
side
of
the
style
perhaps
my
favorite
beer
in
the
nitro
can
this
one
pours
the
sexiest
of
dark
copper
tones
with
a
glorious
nitro
tap
looking
milky
white
froth
head
with
damn
fine
retention
yummy
the
nose
is
dry
malt
in
the
middle
of
the
spectrum
and
some
very
simple
and
to
the
point
ale
yeast
some
mineral
aromatics
too
very
organic
nature
to
this
the
flavor
is
also
decidedly
malt
forward
and
while
the
finish
is
a
tad
on
the
bitter
side
its
not
from
hops
as
far
as
i
can
tell
but
rather
the
combination
of
well
toasted
cereal
grains
and
the
nitro
can
which
always
bitters
a
beer
up
a
little
on
my
palate
maybe
just
me
mouthfeel
of
course
makes
this
one
with
a
milkshake
style
foaminess
to
it
and
a
delicate
character
despite
being
extremely
full
bodied
and
quite
rich
actually
maybe
three
cans
is
the
right
amount
of
this
as
any
more
might
get
filling
and
any
less
seems
to
not
quite
get
to
the
heart
of
my
thirst
perfectly
suited
to
the
nitro
can
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
regular
imports
o
this
would
make
a
good
everyday
drinker
its
definitely
the
most
interesting
nitrocan
beer
ive
ever
had
before
mouth
feel
a
soft
fast
gulp
finish
a
good
beer
for
those
who
like
to
sip
and
drink
at
the
same
time
i
could
call
this
one
of
the
most
sessioned
beers
of
the
season
this
is
what
i
call
a
grade
b
ale
for
those
who
want
to
get
into
scottish
ales
i
have
no
problem
recommending
this
to
my
friends
and
beer
buddies
anytime
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
outstanding
nutty
flavor
that
even
my
wife
liked
the
finish
was
clean
aroma
was
inviting
i
would
drink
this
all

i
was
doing
a

put
it

this
scottish

is

if
you
can

it
can
be

is

are

with
a

of
smokiness
you
are
in
for
a
treat
o
while
there
is
nothing
all
that
standout
about
this
beer
it
is
just
a
solid
very
drinkable
brew
overall
just
average
from
the
bottle
i
would
like
to
try
this
from
a
can
or
tap
as
i
imagine
it
is
much
better
i
assume
the
bottle
doesnt
do
it
justice
very
easy
to
drink
considering
the
giving
feel
and
reasonable
abv
simple
and
enjoyable
taste
is
awesome
i
love
this
stuff
when
england
or
scotland
does
it
right
it
is
good
too
many
funky
weird
ones
out
there
from
those
regions
but
i
really
like
this
distinct
style
and
blend
i
cant
describe
it
but
it
is
the
german
equivalent
to
the
sweetness
of
a
dopplebock
yet
not
as
sweet
but
very
satisfying
and
tasty
this
ought
to
be
the
offical
style
of
the
little
countries
overall
this
is
the
way
in
which
this
beer
should
be
enjoyed
the
standard
carbonation
really
is
much
nicer
for
the
blend
of
sweet
buttery
and
roasted
flavors
of
the
brew
the
nitro
if
you
go
for
a
belhaven
scottish
ale
i
say
go
for
the
non
nitro
quite
nice
odd
as
i
normally
prefer
the
nitro
driven
body
overall
the
character
is
what
one
would
expect
a
scottish
ale
to
be
it
tastes
of
the
earth
and
the
malts
that
make
it
up

bottle

and

did
not
come

a

sour
the
flavors
are

very
pleasant
but
too
light
for
my
taste
the
nitro
widget
gives
this
light
bodied
beer
a
hint
of
creaminess
but
also
seems
to
sap
the
remaining
carbonation
giving
it
a
bit
of
a
flat
mouth
feel
this
is
still
far
better
than
my
last
belhaven
scottish
ale
which
came
in
a
clear
bottle
and
was
badly
skunked
with
the
light
flavoring
i
see
why
that
one
was
a
complete
disaster
a
nice
pleasant
scottish
ale
but
somewhat
bland
a
quality
scottish
ale
at
a
lower
abv
if
there
was
more
on
the
mid
and
finish
id
love
it
but
its
still
a
good
drink
and
enjoyable
its
a
bit
cloudy
with
very
good
head
the
aroma
is
the
best
part
sweet
yet
hoppy
it
smells
fresh
unfortunately
the
taste
does
not
follow
suit
it
tastes
stale
and
slightly
sour
although
this
one
ale
wont
sour
me
to
the
style
it
reminds
me
of
why
i
used
to
dislike
this
style
overall
belhaven
scottish
ale
is
a
great
beer
i
love
to
get
it
around
the
holidays
a
great
staple
to
have
when
you
want
to
have
a
2
or
3
heavier
beers
in
the
winter
months
o
this
to
me
is
just
one
great
beer
that
i
alwys
go
back
to
i
bring
it
to
my
coworkers
when
we
get
of
work
at
night
and
it
is
the
first
gone
and
they
all
agree
tht
it
is
one
great
beer
taste
is
malty
as
well
with
a
hint
of
roasted

alongside

notes

finishes
the

a

very

in

its
not

just
an
easy

overall
worth
checking
out
and
even
a
better
value

overall
we
find
this

to
be

worth

carry
on
the

is
the
big
attraction
with
these
nitro
cans
obviously
and
this
one
delivers
the
goods
as
well
as
any
say
what
you
want
but
sometimes
im
just
in
the
mood
for
this
kind
of
beer
the
belhaven
is
better
than
most
with
good
malt
character
and
less
of
the
overall
blandness
that
plagues
nitrous
beers

i

good
session
beer
something
good
to
drink
in
octobertailgating
perhaps
would
be
a
good
beer
for
bmc
drinker
buy
again
yes
if
i
was
in
the
mood
overall
a
good
beer
for
what
it
is
a
malt
forward
low
hopped
beer
i
would
like
a
touch
more
complexity
i
would
like
to
see
it
finish
a
touch
dryer
no
flaws
get
this
in
the
can
not
the
clear
bottles
you
will
enjoy
it
so
much
more
overall
the
rich
beautiful
color
of
this
beer
in
the
clear
glass
bottle
was
what
made
me
try
it
it
was
smooth
easy
to
drink
and
left
a
malt
aftertaste
behind
a
very
good
beer
great
beer
overall
this
is
a
really
enjoyable
beer
and
quite
quaffable
i
would
like
to
try
it
on
nitro
sometime
o
this
is
a
nice
quality
beer
and
one
of
the
better
scottish
ales
i
have
had
i
wish
the
smell
was
a
little
more
malty
but
other
than
the
smell
it
hits
the
spot
just
an
overall
good
tasting
and
feeling
beer
o
only
slightly
reminiscent
of
the
scottish
ales
i
drank
in
scotland
but
nice
this
would
go
nicely
with
something
spicy
indian
perhaps
o
a
very
good
beer
smooth
malty
the
only
turn
off
is
the
tinny
flavor
i
got
from
it
i
was
drinking
it
out
of
a
pint
glass
poured
from
a
fresh
bottle
i
tasted
it
with
a
salty
chicken
stew
which
was
definitely
not
an
ideal
pairing
for
this
brew
this
is
my
first
go
with
a
scottish
ale
since
i
had
railbender
a
couple
years
back
this
beer
had
some
qualities
that
reminded
me
of
a
nice
scotch
and
i
found
it
to
be
a
nice
change
up
from
my
usual
fare
at
10
a
six
at
the
world
market
up
in
albuquerque
i
dont
see
belhaven
becoming
a
staple
in
my
fridge
rather
something
ill
pick
up
now
and
again
when
the
mood
strikes
for
a
nice
session
brew
either
way
i
find
this
beer
to
be
quite
enjoyable
the
flavor
to
me
is
sweet
with
toffee
and
chocolate
similar
to
the
smell
im
getting
it
does
have
bitterness
in
it
though
that
is
not
to
be
ignored
this
beer
is
full
of
flavors
im
still
trying
to
think
of
them
all
after
finishing
it
it
reminds
me
of
nuts
brown
ale
toffee
dark
chocolate
mild
hop
bitterness
caramel
and
more
its
on
the
light
end
of
medium
bottied
which
is
interesting
because
usually
a
beer
this
flavorful
is
really
full
bodied
this
increases
its
drinkability
to
a
point
in
my
opinion
its
easy
for
me
to
finish
one
of
these
but
too
keep
drinking
them
i
think
id
get
too
overwhelmed
with
flavors
this
was
a
fun
beer
and
id
like
to
get
another
one
sometime
overall
a
great
session
beer
it
tastes
delicious
and
goes
down
very
smooth
i
was
surprised
at
how
good
this
was
a
six
pack
could
go
down
with
ease
o
i
have
no
clue
why
this
is
rated
so
hghly
when
ive
had
oktoberfest
that
have
the
same
taste
to
it
the
thinness
is
the
true
killer
here
because
it
feels
like
water
and
with
its
taste
this
just
isnt
appealing
dr
ill
have
to
review
this
from
the
can
because
i
remember
being
dazzled
by
the
head
this
was
a
huge
disappointment
its
drinkable
but
id
never
buy
it
again
at
least
not
the
bottled
form
this
is
a
great
beer
smooth
and
nutty
truly
beautiful
and
complex
let
her
warm
up
a
bit
and
shell
give
you
a
nice
little
buzz
as
thanks
this
beer
wont
change
the
world
but
you
will
enjoy
the
hell
out
of
it
especailly
in
the
scene
where
the
lawyer
gets
eaten
by
the
trex
while
sitting
on
the
crapper
poured
ontap
and
served
in
a
20oz
vase
the
beer
is
a
deep
clear
dark
auburncopper
color
with
a
thick
solid
one
inch
creamy
white
head
light
malt
and
caramel
aromas
effervescent
and
enticing
the
flavors
are
light
on
a
creamy
smooth
body
malty
rich
caramel
and
slight
alcohol
with
a
roasty
undertone
nutty
and
sweet
malt
aftertaste
with
a
slow
slick
finish
tasty
but
gets
heavy
after
a
while
of
drinking
rjt
o
i
love
this
beer
extremely
sessionable
a
pleasing
aroma
and
delicious
yet
mild
flavours
incredible
feel
and
fantastic
looks
im
still
searching
for
that
beautifully
thick
and
creamy
british
beer
that
isnt
quite
so
mild
however
o
i
was
a
big
fan
of
it
im
not
sure
how
much
it
costs
but
i
could
definitely
see
myself
getting
a
six
of
this
if
i
could
find
it
for
a
nice
autumn
day
it
is
one
of
the
better
fall
beers
that
ive
had
overall
good
beer
overall
definitely
worth
giving
a
try
on
nitro
o
great
beer
i
love
scottish
ales
and
this
does
nothing
to
change
that
i
probably
wouldnt
buy
a
six
pack
for
my
friends
its
pretty
strong
but
might
be
a
bit
much
for
the
average
drinker
overall
very
easy
to
drink
but
doesnt
really
give
much
in
the
way
of
taste
or
complexity
this
tasting
was
also
out
of
a
bottle
and
not
on
nitro
which
could
have
something
to
do
with
the
lack
of
taste
nice
beer
to
consume
not
the
bomb
but
also
not
disappointing
definitely
worth
a
try
d
quite
nice
to
drink
and
with
the
lower
abv
i
would
defiantly
enjoy
a
few
of
these
in
a
sitting
medium
bodied
with
great
carbonation
this
beer
is
a
creamy
drinkable
and
enjoyable
the
body
is
neither
too
thick
nor
too
light
allowing
the
beer
to
coat
your
mouth
well
without
become
sticky
the
carbonation
is
almost
undetectable
but
is
definitely
doing
more
than
its
fair
share
for
this
beer
o
a
pretty
good
beer
does
very
well
with
nitro
the
malt
flavors
are
very
tasty
and
inviting
o
this
malty
scottish
ale
is
easy
to
recommend
much
better
than
the
more
popular
and
available
nitrocan
from
boddingtons
allowed
to
warm
a
bit
before
serving
but
still
improved
with
further
warming
not
the
finest
scottish
ale
but
certainly
a
nice
one
easy
to
drink
and
unique
enough
to
want
another
mouthfeel
rich
full
mouth
feel
feels
good
overall
this
is
a
decent
brew
though
no
doubt
some
will
be
turned
off
by
the
smoky
peaty
malts
and
wish
for
a
sweeter
beverage
mothfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
great
for
the
style
the
nitro
can
really
improves
this
in
my
opinion
as
i
have
had
this
out
of
the
bottle
in
the
past
and
did
not
enjoy
it
or
find
it
as
memorable
overall
this
is
a
great
session
ale
for
anytime
of
the
year
but
probably
best
around
the
fall
time
when
i
enjoy
my
brown
ales
the
most
hop
of
the
heap
for
the
style
and
doesnt
go
overboard
in
any
category
while
still
being
extremely
flavorable
and
drinkable
the
beer
is
pretty
lightbodied
and
seems
a
bit
thin
an
easily
drinkable
beer
but
a
little
light
in
flavor
for
my
palate
still
its
a
nice
representation
of
the
style
o
very
good
beer
the
head
stuck
around
th
whole
time
and
left
exceptional
lacing
t
roast
some
caramel
at
the
beggining
and
sweet
malt
low
bitterness
chewy
dry
finish
a
scottish
ale
with
a
nice
fruity
presence
well
balanced
with
a
nice
array
of
flavors
has
a
slight
metallic
presence
but
not
bad
overall
a
very
nice
beer
great
drinkability
i
can
see
having
more
than
a
few
of
these
from
scotlands
oldest
brewery
since
1719
that
is
still
in
operation
today
this
is
one
heck
of
an
enjoyable
ale
this
ale
sports
a
deep
dark
walnut
color
and
a
somewhat
thick
slightly
heavy
rich
malty
nutty
flavor
depending
on
how
you
pour
it
the
head
can
froth
up
from
1
finger
to
3
fingers
and
stick
with
you
through
the
entire
drink
the
warm
fermentation
process
yields
very
subtle
fruity
flavors
that
are
in
no
way
overbearing
but
rather
just
a
slight
aftertaste
that
coincides
with
its
very
smooth
and
creamy
finish
enjoy
some
today
smooth
aftertaste
low
abv
make
this
a
perfect
session
beer
pours
a
four
finger
white
head
that
fades
quickly
leaving
some
lace
nice
crystal
clear
amber
color
lightmedium
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
grainy
malty

and
flavor
is

3
50
for
a
500ml
bottle
from
market
basket
concord
nh
this
beer
was
just
good
well
balance
i
thought
with
nothing
really
competing
against
each
other
highly
drinkable
too
its
a
shame
i
only
have
one
of
these
d
easy
to
drink
not
tiring
and
low
abv
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
that
drinks
well
with
a
low
abv
could
have
several
of
these
and
be
okay
i
will
definately
return
to
this
one
as
the
summer
progresses
nice
malt
mixture
a
bit
more
caramelization
and
smokiness
great
mouthfeel
almost
fluffy
eminently
drinkable
and
will
gladly
grab
again
overall
this
is
a
pretty
average
thirst
quencher
not
bad
for
a
session
beer
on
a
warm
day
i
admit
something
in
that
limey
water
brings
me
back
to
my
povertystricken
days
in
camden
town
nights
of
warm
pints
in
old
bars
bowls
of
olives
and
stale
bread
its
comforting
but
at
the
same
time
it
urges
me
forward
time
to
forget
or
at
the
very
least
reassess
overall
whatever
happened
to
drinkability
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beerboth
for
parties
and
dinners
d
this
beer
was
made
for
a
nitrotap
it
adds
so
much
to
this
otherwise
slightly
above
average
brew
insanely
quaffable
i
could
drink
this
all
night
long
the
abv
of
just
above
5
also
aids
to
the
drinkability
this
beer
pours
out
as
a
golden
color
with
really
nice
nitro
charged
head
on
it
the
lacing
is
quite
good
on
this
beer
the
smell
is
a
bit
mild
smells
fresh
and
kind
of
creamy
there
are
some
grains
on
the
nose
that
are
pleasant
the
taste
is
light
but
had
a
pretty
good
malt
base
with
a
pretty
good
bitter
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
creamy
and
light
definitely
a
nice
brew
to
try
o
tried
this
one
after
repeated
recommendations
from
a
friend
and
i
can
see
what
he
is
raving
about
after
all
this
time
certainly
not
my
most
favorite
beer
but
this
is
definitely
on
the
buy
again
list
overall
im
not
that
impressed
but
it
was
drinkable
this
is
a
beer
for
an
entire
night
or
maybe
with
dinner
it
is
not
a
treat
as
it
is
pretty
simple
and
not
too
flavorful
overall
this
is
a
very
good
brew
great
as
an
after
dinner
drink
overall
im
a
fan
refreshing
yet
creamy
light
in
flavor
but
a
great
beer
for
me
and
summer
time
in
texas
overall
drinkability
this
is
now
2
for
2
in
the
past
3
months
that
i
have
been
unable
to
get
a
good
bottle
of
this
beer
that
i
had
many
years
ago
and
loved
either
this
stuff
does
not
keep
fresh
or
the
clear
glass
is
ruining
it
i
suspect
its
the
clear
glass
is
ruining
the
beer
in
the
store
while
it
sits
on
the
shelf
if
i
can
find
a
bottle
i
know
is
really
really
fresh
ill
buy
it
again
and
review
again
but
otherwise
i
think
im
going
to
skip
this
one
i
recommend
it
great
scotch
ale
example
mouthfeel
was
creamy
and
smooth
with
low
carbonation
a
buttery
and
almost
velvety
feel
on
the
tongue
and
a
light
to
medium
body
if
you
like
malty
beers
then
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
brew
i
enjoyed
it
and
could
make
it
a
session
beer
if
i
was
in
the
malt
for
a
malt
dominant
beer
with
just
the
right
amount
of
sweetness
an
excellent
scottish
ale
and
one
of
my
all
time
favorites
even
though
i
tend
to
like
heavy
beers
like
russian
imperials
and
the
like
goes
excellent
with
junmai
dry
sake
o
this
was
a
unique
beer
to
say
the
least
there
are
a
lot
of
ales
out
there
and
im
always
up
to
trying
new
things
i
regret
to
say
though
that
i
wont
be
having
this
again
ill
still
be
keeping
my
eye
out
for
more
scottish
imports
in
the
future
im
always
in
the
market
for
redemption
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
weak
but
over
all
it
is
quite
nice
conclusion
i
was
expecting
something
rich
and
sweet
so
i
was
quite
disappointed
with
this
one
im
not
sure
if
this
is
how
a
scottish
ale
should
taste
so
i
cant
rate
it
too
low
but
i
can
say
that
i
really
didnt
like
this
after
the
initial
disappointment
i
tried
to
take
it
for
what
it
is
but
just
couldnt
get
into
it
this
one
was
a
waste
of
3

bleh
flavor
is

with

almost

will

again

this

great
everyday
scottish
ale
would
love
to
have
it
cask
conditioned
in
the
old
town
section
of
edinburgh
mmm
o
a
great
beer
i
really
enjoyed
it
i
could
session
this
one
overall
id
drink
this
in
scotland
to
try
it
fresh
i
probably
wont
buy
it
again
over
here
in
the
states
o
very
solid
beer
its
part
of
my
regulars
the
aroma
is
subtle
toffee
and
caramel
with
a
nice
presence
of
peated
malt
come
out
in
great
balance
the
taste
is
similar
with
a
malty
sweetness
that
comes
through
in
the
finish
smooth
and
silky
on
the
palate
this
beer
is
very
well
done
and
flavorful
especially
given
the
relatively
low
alcohol
level
as
compared
to
other
versions
of
the
style
that
i
have
been
able
to
enjoy
for
such
a
widely
distributed
and
affordable
beer
i
am
not
sure
you
can
do
much
better
in
terms
of
a
scottish
ale
o
i
like
this
brew
and
find
it
very
easy
to
drink
o
nice
example
of
the
style
definitely
a
quaffable
beer
that
can
pair
with
any
meal
well
o
a
good
beer
that
i
just
dont
think
i
am
fond
of
could
have
another
but
wont

notes
nitro
was
nice
and
helped
but
this
is
another
slightly
lackluster
import
from
the
uk
some
english
hopmalt
characteristics
but
doesnt
deliver
fully
decent
but
nowhere
near
the
top
beers
you
can
get
from
the
uk
i
know
pretty
much
described
most
uk
imports
o
this
is
a
goto
when
all
else
fails
me
somewhat
of
a
comfort
brew
why
im
not
sure
i
cant
believe
some
people
consider
this
to
be
the
flagship
for
the
style
o
not
enthused
with
this
one
would
be
interested
in
another
sample
maybe
the
can
version
d
at
5
2
abv
this
is
definitely
an
easily
drinkable
beer
but
with
what
i
see
as
inconsistancies
in
the
taste
i
am
going
to
look
elsewhere
next
time
pretty
decent
and
drinkable
ale
would
be
easy
to
session
nothing
special
but
above
average
taste
is
the
same
malty
roasted
sweetness
and
a
lush
creamy
smooth
mouthfeel
i
like
malty
beers
so
im
really
liking
this
i
think
i
may
need
another
well
i
didnt
expect
much
out
of
this
clear
bottled
brew
but
i
quickly
changed
my
mind
after
the
pour
this
has
excellent
sweet
malt
flavor
and
combination
of
the
carbonation
and
hops
add
perfect
balance
delicious
scottish
ale
this
is
my
favorite
ive
had
maybe
a
few
beers
that
were
better
but
it
certainly
stands
amongst
the
best
however
belhaven
scottish
is
my
definite
top
choice
certainly
going
to
go
back
and
try
this
from
the
bottle
and
also
from
one
of
them
fancy
nitro
cans
recommended
this
was
quite
a
nice
pint
poured
a
1
head
of
the
finest
most
silky
kind
hazy
brownish
color
almost
a
malted
milk
smell
of
sweet
malt
taste
is
mild
and
easy
drinking
a
little
sweet
with
the
slightest
hints
of
the
start
of
stout
flavors
like
chocolate
and
coffee
my
drinking
companion
for
the
night
was
also
happily
pleased
good
product
d
excellent
in
my
opinion
the
last
tastes
the
same
as
the
first
you
could
simply
be
testing
this
beer
or
you
could
be
going
for
a
marathon
it
simply
doesnt
matter
you
will
like
this
beer
d
you
could
drink
plenty
of
this
if
you
like
the
problem
i
would
have
is
that
i
just
am
not
very
impressed
by
this
beer
d
this
beer
was
interesting
abv
was
low
enough
to
drink
but
the
metallic
off
flavors
really
limited
the
beer
overall
i
would
like
to
try
this
one
again
with
maybe
a
fresh
bottle
oh
well
from
notes
at
old
chicago
2001
clear
copper
colour
with
a
quickly
diminishing
beige
frothy
head
sweet
toastmalty
aroma
with

and
lemonfruity

flavour
light

slightly
fizzy
mouthfeel
initially
toasty
malty
with
notes
of
butterscotch
moderately
dry
and
fruity
finish
with
a
pleasant
and
quite
rounded
bitterness
drinkability
reminds
me
of
cream
soda
so
yes
i
would
like
another
poured
from
a
can
into
a
mug
nitro
is
great
wonderful
creamy

not
much
smell
kind
of
citrusy
nice
malty
taste
medium
mouthfeel
with
light
carbonation
light
hoppy
finish
very
nice
heavy
i
love
the
nitro
very
easy
to
drink
definatley
a
good
session
beer
a
nice
easy
to
drink
malty
ale
with
nice
yeast
character
drinkability
overall
pretty
good
wellbalanced
and
quite
drinkable
i
wouldnt
go
far
to
say
that
it
is
near
the
pinnacle
of
its
style
but
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
a
nitrocan
yknow
for
kicks
there
are
few
if
any
better
options
than
this
nutty
and
caramel
combines
for
a
sweet
pecan
pie
like
aroma
mild
spice
taste
is
similarly
nutty
and
caramel
apple
cider
mouthfeel
is
nitro
creamy
d
this
is
incredibly
boring
at
least
it
beats
bmc
nothing
comes
on
strong
in
this
beer
except
the
drinkability
its
sweet
tasty
smooth
and
lightly
creamy
its
very
easy
to
have
3
or
4
of
these
down
before
you
realize
it
although
a
bit
pricey
ill
keep
drinking
this
one
as
long
as
there
is
some
in
the
freezer
case
d
lighter
than
their
wee
heavy
but
an
easy
drinking
beer
simple
and
enjoyable
d
amazing
very
smoothe
asy
beer
to
drink
i
would
gladly
choose
this
at
any
bar
or
pick
it
up
in
any
store
a
scottish
staple
at
all
bars
this
beer
is
really
nothing
special
it
is
in
he
same
field
as
mcewans
tennants
carlsberg
and
the
like
some
people
rave
about
it
and
while
the
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
is
akin
to
sex
the
taste
is
nothing
special
and
the
overall
experience
is
generally
lacking
d
excellent
drinker
definitely
would
like
to
have
this
on
tap
to
experience
the
real
character
of
this
beer
dsuper
easy
drinking
delicious
scottish
ale
this
was
a
favorite
among
several
people
at
the
tasting
likely
due
to
the
crisp
flavors
and
clean
finish
that
added
to
its
drinkability
a
very
approachable
scottish
ale
given
a
low
abv
smoothness
and
ease
with
which
it
goes
down
this
is
as
drinkable
as
it
gets
highly
drinkable
id
like
to
try
this
beer
on
nitrotap
which
would
probably
be
better
than
the
bottled
version
this
is
one
of
the
better
import
ales
ive
had
its
worth
a
try
very
crisp
clean
all
around
perfect
blend
o
malts
some
spice
and
grains
one
of
my
alltime
favorites
it
makes
the
year
round
rotation
always
sure
to
have
a
few
on
hand
very
drinkable
if
not
that
exciting
beer
id
have
liked
the
flavors
to
come
out
more
as
it
seems
thin
to
me
whats
there
however
is
pretty
tasty
drinkability
this
is
a
decent
beverage
but
considering
the
price
9
994pk
i
might
be
hesitant
to
drink
this
again
in
favor
of
more
appealing
choices
in
this
style
nice
rather
enjoyable
completely
drinkable
d
not
a
terrible
brew
tasty
but
not
something
that
will
slap
you
across
your
face
and
get
your
attention
i
would
drink
it
again
but
wont
go
out
of
my
way
to
buy
it
the
mouthfeel
is
probably
my
favorite
thing
about
belhaven
scottish
i
know
im
overusing
thick
here
but
its
a
thick
beer
and
it
coats
your
tongue
in
a
good
way
poured
this
guy
into
a
pint
glass
the
body
is
a
transparent
mahogany
brown
with
a
finger
of
thick
snow
cap
white
head
that
doesnt
reduce
at
all
looks
real
sharp
if
i
may
say
so
slightly
sour
in
the
nose
with
rum
and
butterscotch
aroma
the
blend
kind
of
reminds
me
of
cough
syrup
but
the
really
sweet
kind
you
give
to
kids
cherries
and
bready
malts
round
out
the
aroma
the
taste
is
overall
pretty
bland
similar
to
the
aroma
but
pretty
toned
down
rum
soaked
cherries
and
bready
malts
take
the
stage
on
the
pallet
not
bad
but
i
wish
it
was
a
bit
more
the
mouthfeel
is
what
you
would
expect
from
a
nitro
can
creamy
low
carbonation
and
kind
of
light
bodied
solid
brew
here
id
be
interested
to
try
it
from
another
serving
type
note
maybe
its
just
me
but
i
love
how
the
clear
bottle
and
off
white
label
work
with
the
color
of
this
beer
it
remains
me
of
scotch
whiskey
credit
to
the
brewer
for
that
tried
some
of
this
one
last
night
at
fresh
craft
and
was
thoroughly
unimpressed
poured
a
clear
copper
color
with
a
decent
white
head
on
top
aromas
of
toffee
nuts
and
sweet
malt
on
the
palate
this
one
was
thin
and
watery
and
really
lacking
in
any
distinctive
flavor
the
abv
listed
on
the
menu
was
3
9
so
i
am
left
wondering
if
the
draft
version
is
watered
down
for
the
guinness
crowd
not
good
belhaven
scottish
ale
has
an
amber
colour
with
a
decent
head
and
lacing
the
smell
is
sweet
and
malty
with
some
hints
of
honey
the
taste
is
similarly
malty
and
i
tasted
the
same
hints
of
honey
it
has
a
nice
toasty
finish
too
this
beer
is
well
carbonated
and
foamy
so
it
feels
quite
thick
in
your
mouth
d
decent
ale
but
missing
good
pronounced
caramels
to
balance
the
toasted
malts
i
look
for
scotch
ales
that
are
better
defined
this
ones
too
subtle
and
light
easy
to
drink
more
than
one
if
this
is
a
styletaste
you
like
drink
well
my
friends
d
flavorful
and
not
too
potent
for
me
its
the
earthy
hop
bitternes
that
makes
this
one
thirst
queching
and
entirely
drinkable
its
an
understated
bitterness
and
its
totally
mild
but
does
alot
to
tame
the
caramelized
malt
flavors
as
stated
above
i
enjoy
this
version
much
more
than
the
nitro
can
i
had
mainly
because
the
flavors
and
aroma
are
much
more
pronounced
overall
a
pleasing
beer
but
is
different
from
type
for
your
typical
ale
d
i
think
this
is
a
nice
beer
to
sit
back
and
have
a
few
or
more
with
some
pub
grub
its
such
an
easy
drinking
brew
one
can
easily
get
carried
away
on
a
six
pack
of
it
not
bad
and
worth
a
try
if
your
into
the
style
cheers
great
beer
tasty
and
very
sessionable
i
would
not
mind
trying
this
on
tap
over
some
pub
grub
taste
is
incredibly
fruity
as
well
everything
from
green
apples
to
rum
soaked
raisins
to
mangoes
yeasty
bread
dough
and
a
touch
of
darkly
sweet
caramelized
malts
its
ok
but
a
little
too
fruity
for
me
and
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
what
the
nitrogen
does
for
it
seems
to
emphasize
the
fruit
and
take
the
rich
malts
to
the
back
jeff
spicoli
d
a
solid
ale
with
full
flavor
and
nice
drinkability
the
beer
itself
is
not
too
heavy
but
the
fairly
strong
malt
character
may
not
appeal
to
some
d
nice
beer
low
in
alcohol
make
it
very
easy
to
consume
the
aroma
and
mouthfeel
are
some
really
strong
positives
for
this
one
good
choice
on
a
cool
fall
evening
such
as
this
one
pours
a
moderately
light
toffee
color
with
an
off
white
head
tiny
bits
of
lacing
nose
brings
forward
toffee
and
caramel
with
a
bit
of
butterscotch
taste
is
overwhelmed
by
butterscotch
and
toffee
without
any
particular
amount
of
sweetness
i
am
not
actually
sure
whether
this
was
any
amount
of
diacetyl
as
it
was
not
off
putting
in
that
particular
manner
and
did
not
have
the
off
buttered
popcorntype
flavor
it
might
just
be
that
this
particular
version
of
the
style
really
does
not
suit
me
feel
is
light
with
fairly
low
carbonation
i
just
couldnt
get
past
the
taste
on
this
very
smooth
and
drinkable
beer
there
is
great
lacing
on
the
glass
and
a
nice
foamy
head
that
lasts
until
the
last
sip
the
nitro
helps
the
beer
remain
smooth
until
the
end
even
as
it
wars
up
a
bit
this
beer
can
also
be
enjoyed
as
a
session
beer
with
its
somewhat
low
abv
and
great
mouthfeel
d
this
was
an
extremely
easy
drinking
beer
however
the
lingering
hop
bitterness
made
me
want
to
switch
things
up
after
a
couple
pints
then
go
back
for
more
i
have
to
admit
i
had
low
expectations
for
this
brew
however
i
may
have
found
a
new
favorite
style
go
scottish
ales
drinkability
its
easy
to
drink
but
not
in
a
good
way
seems
almost
overly
simply
tastes
almost
very
macro
american
simple
to
me
with
not
all
that
much
flavor
and
not
very
much
complexity
its
not
bad
in
anyone
one
way
and
certianly
easy
drinking
but
just
not
something
you
would
ever
be
searching
out
for
just
to
bland
dthis
was
decent
but
not
something
i
will
seek
again
since
there
are
so
many
other
styles
and
beers
i
like
better
a
clear
copper
in
appearance
with
a
super
creamy
tan
head
smell
is
of
toffee
taste
is
buttery
sweet
up
front
with
a
toasty
grain
middle
and
a
dry
earthy
bitter
finish
mouthfeel
is
weak
terrible
nitro
instead
of
carbonation
drinkability
is
decent
the
nitro
really
doesnt
do
this
beer
justice
i
think
it
would
be
a
lot
better
with
co2
crispy
yet
smooth
going
down
this
beer
could
get
me
in
trouble
i
could
drink
it
with
every
meal
and
replace
water
with
it
in
my
diet
but
im
pretty
sure
that
would
end
badly
must
learn
to
limit
the
fantastical
goodness
next
up
on
my
exloration
of
the
british
isles
is
belhaven
scottish
ale
paid
9
99
for
a
four
pack
of
nitro
cans
so
im
hoping
that
i
get
my
monies
worth
beautiful
golden
amber
with
a
lush
creamy
head
nutty
caramelish
taste
with
a
somewhat
smokey
finish
well
rounded
and
balanced
i
cant
see
ponying
up
10
on
a
regular
basis
for
4
of
these
but
i
think
i
can
see
myself
getting
them
every
now
and
then
drinkability
truly
an
impressive
beer
the
inviting
nose
carries
through
to
the
taste
and
does
not
disappoint
light
to
medium
bodied
with
high
carbonation
i
would
like
this
better
with
a
little
less
carbonation
a
decent
to
good
beer
which
i
would
not
mind
having
again
some
day
d
a
great
session
option
for
the
night
at
the
pub
the
tame
abv
and
clean
smooth
consistency
of
malt
flavors
make
it
a
reliable
option
wont
wow
you
with
flavors
but
its
as
steadfast
a
uk
option
as
they
come
drinkability
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
this
beer
reminds
me
of
the
fall
season
i
will
definitely
give
this
a
second
go
round
not
too
heavy
and
would
go
well
on
those
crisp
cool
fall
evenings
conclusion
nice
scottish
ale
my
only
complaint
is
that
its
almost
a
bit
too
buttery
and
a
tad
sweet
drinkability
the
caramel
flavor
nitro
creaminess
and
light
body
make
for
a
very
interesting
session
beer
d
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
i
havent
had
many
scottish
ales
but
this
one
definitely
makes
me
want
to
try
more
not
especially
exciting
but
a
solid
beer
nonetheless
something
my
bmc
drinking
friends
and
i
can
both
enjoy
mouth
feel
a
cunning
combination
of
creamy
and
crisp
smooth
beer
with
a
carnival
of
different
flavors
overall
this
one
was
okay
it
started
off
really
well
but
towards
the
end
the
beer
started
to
break
down
a
little
a
little
to
mellow
for
my
taste
but
otherwise
a
solid
beer
i
would
not
mind
having
this
one
again
it
was
enjoyable
my
first
scottish
ale
good
stuff
shame
its
12
a
sixer
but
still
worth
checking
out
d
a
fine
example
of
the
type
its
really
good
but
i
know
better
ones
so
id
buy
it
in
a
pinch
drinkability
4
out
of
5
belhaven
scottish
ale
looks
good
smells
good
tastes
good
and
feels
good
enough
to
drink
all
night
not
much
else
needs
to
be
said
except
lang
may
yer
lum
reek
which
is
apparently
a
scottish
phrase
wishing
prosperity
and
long
life
i
think
it
literally
translates
to
long
may
your
chimney
smoke
overall
not
sure
id
want
to
drink
this
very
often
the
pepper
flavor
is
interesting
but
a
little
off
putting
drinkability
seeing
as
the
brewery
dates
back
to
1719
i
can
see
why
theyve
had
lasting
power
very
good
traditional
taste
would
come
back
to
this
one
again
d
i
was
somewhat
disappointed
by
this
brew
i
look
forward
to
trying
it
on
tap
though
a
bit
of
a
caramel
aroma
light
and
creamy
body
sweet
malts
to
start
hints
of
caramel
and
fruit
deep
in
the
beer
as
well
also
a
bit
of
scotch
flavor
in
there
ends
a
with
a
little
dryness
and
hoppy
aftertaste
pretty
standard
europeanstylescottish
ale
being
of
scottish
decent
i
had
to
try
this
one
and
i
really
enjoyed
it
i
have
a
knack
for
scottish
ales
and
if
you
like
them
too
give
this
one
a
shot
because
you
wont
be
disappointed
very
drinkable
could
have
some
nice
sessions
with
this
brew
i
really
wanted
to
like
this
beer
it
looked
and
smelled
great
but
the
taste
thinned
out
way
too
much
to
make
it
really
flavorful
not
bad
just
not
anything
special
a
bar
standard
easy
drinking
and
tasty
i
tend
to
overlook
it
on
a
stacked
list
but
it
hasnt
let
me
down
yet
the
first
smell
was
very
nice
yes
we
have
malts
here
yes
sweet
yes
caramel
almost
like
a
brown
ale
the
flavor
is
pretty
straight
forward
and
tasty
but
with
enough
complexity
to
keep
things
interesting
mostly
malts
a
little
floral
hops
pretty
much
what
i
was
expecting
from
a
beer
from
the
isles
this
is
highly
drinkable
with
a
slightly
thin
but
pleasant
mouthfeel
it
has
a
nice
lingering
sweet
finnish
overall
a
nice
surprise
d
could
session
this
one
easily
at
5
abv
definitely
want
to
try
others
of
the
style
comes
out
of
the
bottle
a
nice
translucent
dark
amber
with
a
fairly
thick
whitish
head
aroma
is
fairly
strong
and
malty
with
a
fruity
hint
flavor
is
malty
and
refreshing
a
good
accompaniment
to
a
meal
texture
is
smooth
and
fairly
fizzy
leaving
behind
a
nice
tingly
finish
light
in
body
soft
carbonation
an
easy
drinker
for
sure
nothing
about
it
particularly
screams
scottish
to
me
but
thats
hardly
a
measure
of
the
beers
worth
ill
have
it
again
and
in
fact
right
now
this
one
is
a
great
brew
allaround
easy
drinking
full
of
flavor
and
i
love
hearty
brews
classic
overall
very
good
beer
in
my
opinion
its
not
challenging
or
complex
just
an
easy
drinking
ale
i
get
this
every
time
its
available
at
finnegans
wake
a
lovely
malty
beer
that
would
surely
be
better
still
on
cask
drinkability
while
im
not
a
big
fan
of
such
a
heavy
hand
with
the
biscuit
malt
i
am
finding
this
to
be
a
highly
quaffable
and
refreshing
beverage
i
would
have
this
again
dthis
is
one
of
those
styles
that
always
seems
to
underwhelm
a
bit
but
i
ultimately
enjoy
them
this
is
very
similar
to
the
other
scottish
ales
ive
had
in
terms
of
taste
and
mouthfeel
and
probably
the
model
on
which
others
are
built
the
tasting
notes
pours
a
hazy
amber
brown
there
are
visual
yeasty
floaties
rising
and
falling
there
is
decent
carbonation
but
not
much
of
a
head
which
recedes
to
leave
some
lacing
behind
the
nose
is
a
maltynutty
aroma
flavormouth
nutty
very
creamy
it
starts
out
sour
upfront
then
is
turns
smooth
and
about
two
seconds
later
the
bitterness
hits
you
this
beer
is
sessionable
with
an
abv
of
5
2
its
a
good
beer
and
i
want
another
to
bad
i
only
bought
one
when
i
was
mixing
ang
matching
a
six
pack
kind
of
a
weak
profile
for
the
style
minimal
smoke
or
thickness
no
alcohol
feel
to
it
which
is
a
plus
i
guess
its
really
uh
boring
i
wouldnt
call
it
sessionable
because
it
just
doesnt
resonate
with
me
the
malt
hopping
just
dont
feel
up
to
par
and
expensive
to
boot
pass
d
super
drinkable
this
beer
is
a
true
classic
d
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
and
quite
sessionable
this
is
a
delicious
and
refreshing
ale
i
could
definitely
drink
this
but
i
dont
think
its
anything
special
by
any
means
really
ordinary
though
it
might
be
pretty
good
for
scotland
overall
the
initial
appearance
raises
expectations
as
does
the
feel
ultimately
this
beer
does
not
live
up
to
those
expectations
preventing
a
high
a
grade
poured
into
my
zatec
fluted
glass
a
massive
nitroinduced
5
fingers
of
head
smells
of
oak
sweet
malt
and
typical
nitro
can
lightly
sweet
malt
typical
of
a
scottish
ale
very
very
smooth
prefer
the
bottle
to
the
can
but
quite
good
goes
down
like
butta
very
flat
on
the
mouthfeel
overall
decent
satisfying
beer
although
not
one
of
my
favorite
scotch
ales
the
appearance
is
hazy
amber
with
a
medium
head
the
aroma
is
malty
with
caramel
toffee
and
a
strange
earthiness
the
flavor
is
like
the
aroma
the
palate
is
average
for
the
style
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
not
something
great
or
remarkable
good
beer
really
enjoyed
it
sweet
and
thick
scottish
ale
that
had
a
good
flavor
considering
the
lower
abv
a
little
too
bland
to
desire
another
pint
but
this
one
went
down
easily
dthis
is
some
easy
drinking
and
offers
up
a
great
balance
with
a
solid
hop
profile
the
nitro
really
gives
it
a
great
feel
on
the
palate
and
this
is
so
enjoyable
a
nicely
done
scottish
ale
its
one
of
the
only
examples
available
to
me
on
a
regular
basis
but
its
not
one
i
go
to
very
often
at
the
price
2
35
for
a
single
12oz
bottle
extremely
drinkable
i
downed
the
whole
cans
worth
in
about
10
minutes
without
even
thinking
about
it
this
is
really
great
definitely
one
ill
revisit
an
ideal
session
beer
in
any
sense
of
the
term
after
pouring
it
had
a
nice
wheat
colored
head
thick
foamy
and
stuck
around
til
the
end
the
color
was
a
dark
amber
with
mahogany
highlights
smell
was
mostly
wheat
with
hints
of
hops
barley
and
a
flowery
note
the
taste
was
bitter
hops
with
barley
and
wheat
overtones
and
subtle
hints
of
citris
and
nuts
mouthfeel
mediumbodied
drinkability
has
a
good
balance
of
flavor
with
a
more
bitter
overtone
not
bad
d
aone
laddy
drink
away
boys
drink
away
overall
a
great
scottish
ale
and
my
favorite
of
the
few
examples
i
have
tried
its
average
not
a
favorite
of
mine
i
do
recall
that
it
is
slightly
better
on
tap
the
drink
is
a
guzzler
waiting
to
happen
i
appreciate
this
more
subtly
flavored
scotch
ale
and
would
be
content
drinking
it
throughout
an
evening
consider
it
as
an
alternative
to
hoppier
pale
ales
for
a
round
overall
impression
scottish
ale
is
quite
possibly
the
best
style
for
most
newbeez
due
to
the
lack
of
hop
flavor
that
they
typically
confuse
with
bitterness
add
to
that
the
rich
malty
flavor
and
the
creaminess
that
nitrocans
offer
and
this
is
a
slamdunk
winner
this
authentic
scottish
ale
from
belhaven
pours
a
nice
deep
copper
color
with
a
thin
creamy
and
offwhite
head
the
nose
gives
off
a
slightly
sweet
malty
bready
and
nutty
aroma
as
you
sip
it
the
nitrogen
pour
makes
it
feel
nice
and
creamy
on
the
palate
with
a
medium
body
the
aroma
follows
through
pretty
well
on
the
palate
but
doesnt
quite
blow
you
away
with
its
toasty
malt
slight
breadiness
and
a
roasted
nutty
and
smokey
flavors
with
hints
of
caramel
a
smooth
creamy
malt
finish
and
a
nice
sessionable

abv
d
this
beer
is
delicious
since
the
beer
finishes
so
smoothly
i
could
definitely
session
with
this
drinkability
can
drink
a
couple
in
a
sitting
due
to
great
mouthfeel
and
nice
sweetness
and
alcohol
is
subtle
the
brew
is
a
little
thin
and
leaves
a
pastiness
in
the
back
of
the
throat
that
i
didnt
care
for
it
was
drinkable
enough
and
refreshing
but
overall
id
look
elsewhere
for
an
indoor
quaffer
fun
beer
to
drink
with
friends
or
when
out
and
could
pretty
much
be
consumed
with
any
occasion
or
meal
d
this
is
a
great
session
beer
really
good
maltoriented
flavours
shows
why
belhaven
is
one
of
the
best
out
there
easy
drinking
brew
d
can
i
get
another
low
abv
and
a
nitro
tap
makes
barry
a
happy
boy
thoughts
ok
this
beer
has
the
taste
you
want
but
is
light
enough
where
you
can
still
walk
a
straight
line
after
youre
done
i
would
like
to
belly
up
to
this
brew
with
some
nice
smoked
venison
drinkability
from
the
looks
it
appears
heavy
and
thick
but
well
balanced
is
too
passive
a
term
its
smooth
and
creamy
a
really
great
drinking
experience
drinkable
yes
but
more
like
a
session
beer
drinkability
is
fairly
high
the
beer
all
things
considered
is
quite
sessionable
the
abv
is
easily
managed
and
the
flavor
profile
is
pleasing
enough
to
have
a
few
its
not
the
worlds
greatest
beer
but
its
solid
enough
to
enjoy
poured
into
an
american
pint
glass
copper
amber
with
a
very
thin
head
and
modest
lacing
smelled
of
spiked
iced
tea
apple
and
pear
while
the
flavor
was
a
more
robust
representation
of
the
same
aroma
mix
plus
a
vanilla
oak
kick
mediumbodied
and
supersmooth
with
very
little
carbonation
excellent
session
beer
but
tastes
more
like
a
bitter
rather
than
a
scotch
ale
served
in
a
nonic
poured
with
the
classic
nitro
cascade
eventually
settling
into
a
hazy
liquid
the
color
of
iced
tea
with
a
one
inch
creamy
and
bright
white
head
with
excellent
retention
thick
creamy
sheets
of
lacing
revealed
during
the
session
nose
was
somewhat
subdued
malty
and
a
little
pruney
taste
consistent
with
nose
no
surprises
mouthfeel
was
lightmedium
but
closer
to
the
light
side
of
the
spectrum
and
creamy
easy
drinking
not
much
complexity
but
a
fairly
flavorful
and
light
offering
d
one
great
brew
with
a
ton
of
flavor
for
what
it
is
worth
a
shot
overall
generally
this
is
a
really
great
beer
at
its
worst
though
it
is
still
drinkable
and
would
satisfy
the
less
discriminating
imbiber
without
comment
if
youre
going
to
have
this
one
on
draft
you
may
want
to
ask
for
a
sample
first
it
is
liable
to
be
a
bit
variable
drinkability
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
can
see
myself
slowly
sipping
this
andor
having
a
couple
of
these
in
a
sitting
this
is
an
ok
scottish
ale
but
doesnt
have
that
strong
and
pleasant
scotch
taste
that
the
mcewans
had
belhavens
scottish
ale
is
rather
enjoyable
it
has
a
decent
light
amber
color
and
a
smooth
taste
it
is
easy
to
drink
quickly
but
i
find
other
scotch
ales
more
enjoyable
it
doesnt
offer
that
robust
flavor
that
i
have
come
to
expect
form
scottish
brews
overall
not
a
bad
beer
had
many
times
but
have
found
that
its
tastes
best
in
a
slightly
expired
nitro
can
pour
is
like
eye
candy
from
a
nitro
head
is
quite
thick
and
nice
with
lace
and
thick
foam
palate
is
not
as
bitter
as
on
tap
mellowed
out
nose
of
honey
sweet
malt
and
pollen
a
mild
apple
sour
in
this
case
palate
is
creamy
and
wonderful
great
malt
but
not
overly
sweet
some
breadiness
like
challah
bread
honey
and
pollen
with
a
mild
hop
citrus
lemon
at
the
end
not
sharp
mild
and
corresponding
to
the
malt
character
a
fruit
of
apple
pie
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
quality
although
lighter
and
thinner
than
the
scotch
ale
i
was
expecting
this
ale
has
turned
out
to
be
something
i
really
enjoy
its
a
drinker
not
a
sipper
and
while
i
usually
trend
towards
darker
thicker
brews
this
has
definitely
become
one
of
my
favorites
greatly
drinkable
i
would
like
to
find
it
on
tap
though
i
have
to
do
this
by
memory
because
i
had
this
on
tap
at
upick6
in
erie
pa
but
i
made
sure
to
remember
beautiful
pour
with
the
nitro
tap
creamymalty
caramel
note
flavor
stays
with
you
for
awhile
chewy
i
can
keep
going
so
i
bought
another
this
is
a
classic
scottish
maybe
a
little
less
punch
but
stellar
non
the
less
d
very
smooth
easy
to
drink
nothing
all
that
special
easy
to
drink
but
on
this
spectrum
which
i
assume
goes
from
too
easy
to
be
quality
too
difficult
to
enjoy
i
would
but
it
a
little
on
the
too
easy
side
d
anytime
of
day
every
day
i
could
never
get
tired
of
this
beer
one
of
gods
gifts
to
mankind
nothing
extreme
but
the
best
beer
is
best
left
simple
this
is
without
a
doubt
my
new
favorite
beer
i
am
thrilled
that
the
barmaid
in
mass
talked
me
into
trying
it
now
that
ive
found
it
in
my
hometown
it
will
be
a
staple
i
cant
wait
to
try
a
wee
heavy
to
see
how
it
compares
drinkability
this
is
a
nicely
made
balanced
ale
that
is
a
clear
candidate
for
an
evening
of
drinking
and
conversation
with
friends
it
is
good
but
not
particularly
challenging
it
is
enjoyable
but
not
particularly
complex
just
the
thing
to
suit
my
tastes
if
ive
got
some
things
to
do
but
want
something
to
sip
on
while
doing
it
ill
certainly
be
having
this
one
in
again
someday
notes
uff
it
had
been
a
while
years
in
fact
since
i
had
a
nitro
pour
and
this
is
sort
of
reminding
me
why
that
was
the
case
now
it
is
not
a
pain
to
drink
and
against
other
choices
i
may
pick
it
up
gladly
but
as
of
today
i
think
those
occasions
will
be
few
and
far
between
i
forgot
how
enjoyable
a
bellhaven
can
be
i
usually
dont
dig
on
nitro
but
this
is
one
beer
that
has
been
rendered
flavorless
at
least
at
serving
temperature
by
the
gas
very
drinkable
i
could
sit
down
with
this
one
all
night
for
sure
bellhaven
poured
a
nice
cloudy
caramel
color
with
a
nice
tan
head
the
smell
was
of
caramel
sweet
hints
of
some
lightly
roasted
malt
the
taste
was
full
sweet
caramel
mouthfeel
was
a
little
sticky
drinkability
was
good
overall
a
nice
beer
with
good
flavors
mouthfeel
isnt
that
great
either
but
drinkability
is
pretty
high
much
better
experience
poured
from
a
regular
bottle
d
balanced
extremely
drinkable
and
enjoyable
beer
not
the
most
complex
scottish
ale
but
is
my
standard
to
which
i
compare
all
others
in
this
style
verdict
straightforward
yet
tasty
and
nicely
sessionable
belhaven
is
a
great
example
of
the
loweralcohol
style
of
scottish
ale
if
youre
a
fan
of
nitro
creaminess
and
youre
looking
for
a
new
quaffable
new
brew
this
is
a
great
choice
d
i
think
overall
id
say
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
going
for
it
if
you
know
where
to
look
wouldnt
have
guessed
it
weighing
in
at
5
either
as
it
drinks
quite
faster
than
that
would
be
interesting
to
see
how
it
compares
to
a
bottle
or
draft
poured
from
a
14
9
oz
nitro
can
has
a
cloudy
brown
color
with
a
slowly
fading
1
inch
head
some
yeast
and
hops
detected
not
a
strong
aroma
taste
is
very
mild
not
a
lot
of
flavor
feels
creamy
in
the
mouth
and
has
decent
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
selection
surprisingly
strong
chocolate
notes
from
this
dark
scottish
ale
the
huge
mouth
feel
actually
finishes
very
smooth
a
strong
ale
to
be
savored
it
was
both
the
perfect
accompaniment
for
and
participant
in
i
used
it
in
the
marinade
my
grilled
shrimp
the
taste
is
toasty
grain
with
hints
of
chocolate
nuttiness
earthy
leaves
caramel
and
a
little
prune
it
has
light
sweetness
with
the
nuttyleafychocolatey
bitterness
just
barely
dominating
through
the
finish
after
which
a
light
sweet
caramelly
maltiness
lingers
it
retains
a
nice
firm
body
uinderneath
the
creamy
head
and
does
not
become
so
watery
like
many
nitro
beers
can
be
overall
the
bottle
version
owns
the
nitro
canwhich
i
will
never
buy
again
bye
i
absolutely
love
the
taste
of
this
beer
lightly
malted
but
with
a
clear
melon
or
cantaloupe
component
you
could
drink
this
all
day
and
i
frequently
do
the
nitro
gives
this
a
full
body
thats
easy
on
the
tongue
reach
for
this
one
when
you
just
want
a
beer
it
wont
steer
you
wrong
drinkability
is
high
easy
to
finish
you
can
have
a
few
of
these
with
cloying
flavor
is
great
drinkability
goes
down
very
easy
not
sure
if
id
try
this
one
again
since
im
a
hophead
but
a
great
example
of
a
beer
that
puts
malt
flavor
at
the
forefront
not
my
personal
favorite
but
im
coming
off
an
esb
and
a
4month
tasting
hiatus
ill
try
this
one
again
d
nothing
too
exciting
or
bad
about
this
beer
its
just
a
good
easy
to
drink
beer
thats
worth
trying
sometime
after
pouring
this
beer
it
produced
a
lighttan
layer
of
foam
which
was
about
two
fingers
thick
next
a
nice
layer
of
lace
stuck
to
the
mug
this
brew
has
a
rich
amber
color
plus
this
beer
is
quite
clear
the
hops
are
very
light
to
the
nose
but
this
beer
has
some
nice
fruitlike
esters
perhaps
apples
in
addition
to
the
esters
the
malt
aromas
are
very
noticeable
the
malt
really
comes
out
in
the
flavor
which
is
a
strong
point
of
this
beer
likewise
the
hops
come
out
in
the
flavor
overall
this
beer
does
an
excellent
job
of
represneting
this
style
very
crafted
beer
cant
wait
for
the
next
one
drinkability
is
good
all
in
all
a
tasty
session
brew
id
happily
have
another
d
quite
good
i
just
think
there
are
better
beers
out
there
this
is
a
solid
simple
beer
and
a
step
up
from
boddingtons
and
other
pub
nitro
can
beers
like
it
not
going
to
blow
your
socks
off
but
you
sure
can
drink
it
and
its
characterful
enough
to
be
a
goto
brew
ill
certainly
have
it
again
a
better
than
expected
scottish
ale
this
beer
pours
a
medium
amber
with
a
cascading
head
from
the
nitro
widget
i
like
the
look
but
thats
probably
just
because
of
some
remaining
guinness
lovebrainwashing
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
mild
for
a
scottish
ale
the
flavor
has
a
good
balance
of
pleasant
hops
doughy
malt
and
caramelization
i
enjoy
it
but
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
scottish
ales
so
take
that
for
what
you
will
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
drinkability
is
quite
good
for
my
tastes
because
its
not
as
sweet
as
many
other
scottish
ales
this
brew
is
very
drinkable
and
a
nice
crowd
pleaser
this
brew
may
even
be
good
and
surprise
some
non
beer
lovers
good
stuff
d
a
very
nice
scotch
ale
i
could
easily
see
myself
picking
up
a
case
of
this
and
thoroughly
enjoying
until
the
end
d
easy
to
drink
after
the
first
one
or
two
bitter
sips
pass
goes
down
smooth
went
well
with
a
pub
sandwich
and
mashed
for
lunch
could
be
a
good
session
beer
especially
since
the
abv
is
not
too
high
12
ounce
bottle
served
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
dark
amberbrown
color
with
about
an
inch
tan
head
head
retention
is
ok
lacing
is
good
it
smells
like
toasted
malt
nuts
and
a
bit
of
caramel
the
taste
is
the
same
as
the
aroma
however
the
taste
is
stronger
than
the
aroma
would
indicate
there
arent
any
hops
that
i
can
notice
in
either
the
taste
or
the
aroma
but
in
this
case
that
isnt
a
bad
thing
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
a
bit
coating
and
has
moderate
carbonation
drinkability
is
pretty
good
its
smooth
and
very
easy
to
drink
i
could
easily
have
this
as
an
occasional
session
beer
if
you
like
malt
and
scottish
ales
then
you
would
probably
like
this
beer
i
think
its
a
good
solid
brew
an
enjoyable
ale
a
must
for
malt
heads
have
about
two
in
a
row
and
youll
feel
a
little
full
makes
me
want
some
bbq
a
bit
simple
for
my
taste
clearly
a
bit
past
its
prime
too
badill
keep
an
eye
out
for
another
d
this
was
a
good
beer
probably
better
if
i
could
get
it
in
a
six
pack
but
overall
a
decent
flavorful
beer
a
very
pleasant
and
enjoyable
brew
worth
seeking
out
pours
a
very
cloudy
mahogany
light
brown
color
huge
head
to
it
with
tons
of
lacing
mouthfeel
is
pretty
good
body
a
bit
on
the
thin
side
but
wicked
smooth
a
nice
malty
taste
here
with
a
bit
of
the
smokinessnuttiness
to
it
typical
of
the
style
while
not
as
over
the
top
as
old
chub
which
is
an
amazing
beer
this
seems
like
the
baseline
of
scottish
ales
wont
blow
you
away
with
flavor
but
its
beautiful
in
the
glass
and
incredibly
smooth
glad
i
got
to
try
it
d
a
very
nice
scottish
ale
and
quite
sessionable
easy
to
drink
and
not
overly
complex
this
beer
poured
a
dark
amber
with
a
singlefinger
beige
head
the
smell
is
almost
all
malt
with
a
bit
of
toasted
nuttiness
the
taste
starts
off
with
toasted
malt
that
gives
way
to
a
bit
of
hops
to
balance
everything
out
the
mouthfeel
was
slightly
thick
with
moderate
carbonation
and
it
was
a
very
drinkable
beer
a
solid
beer
overall
but
nothing
extra
ordinary
pours
a
clear
amber
color
with
a
thich
white
head
good
lacing
down
the
glass
a
sweet
almost
fruity
aroma
mixed
with
some
earthy
hop
and
toffee
malt
aromas
the
taste
is
sweet
fruity
caramel
malt
with
a
slight
bitterness
in
the
finish
the
is
also
a
slight
smokiness
in
the
finish
the
earthy
hops
come
up
front
in
the
finish
but
dont
overload
the
beer
with
bitterness
a
very
well
balanced
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
drinkability
is
good
definitely
can
have
a
few
of
these
overall
very
mild
but
still
very
well
done
and
enjoyable
its
important
first
time
drinkers
of
this
one
dont
confuse
this
scottish
ale
with
a
scotch
ale
aka
wee
heavy
as
the
unmet
expectations
will
make
it
harder
to
enjoy
this
one
is
all
about
balance
and
subtlety
i
give
this
beer
an
overwhelming
eh
grade
just
not
sure
anything
about
this
beer
is
exceptional
drinkability
good
but
not
great
scottish
ale
overall
i
loved
the
balance
between
the
big
malt
and
the
earthy
hops
it
makes
me
want
to
put
on
a
kilt
and
throw
a
big
tree
around
a
fine
scottish
ale
lads
has
a
great
bottle
it
pours
mighty
fine
in
a
glass
just
listen
to
the
beer
pouring
into
the
glass
its
telling
you
im
a
great
beer
if
your
trying
a
scottish
ale
for
the
frist
time
then
this
is
the
one
to
taste
good
beer
good
taste
a
good
night
had
this
at
the
houston
flying
saucer
poured
in
a
pint
glass
with
a
nice
ruby
red
color
and
a
wonderful
creamy
head
nutty
with
a
cocoa
powder
aroma
light
to
medium
in
carbonation
with
a
very
creamy
mouthfeel
tastes
of
figs
raisin
and
some
prunes
finishes
quite
smooth
i
used
to
like
this
beer
more
a
few
years
back
still
like
it
but
not
as
much
as
before
still
not
a
bad
beer
i
dont
like
beers
with
nutty
tastes
too
much
though
d
very
easy
to
enjoy
and
drink
goes
down
very
easy
and
many
could
be
had
ill
be
looking
for
this
brew
for
home
use
overall
theres
nothing
that
really
stands
out
about
this
beer
but
it
is
very
drinkable
worth
a
shot
d
drinkable
yes
i
prefer
to
have
several
others
but
this
would
do
and
id
like
to
try
it
on
tap
very
drinkable
a
solid
choice
to
session
as
a
good
buddy
has
suggested
d
with
the
5
3
alcohol
content
you
could
really
make
this
a
session
beer
this
is
quickly
becoming
one
of
my
favorites
it
has
lovely
color
in
the
glass
middeep
copper
color
but
the
taste
is
what
hooks
me
sweet
caramel
goodness
with
great
mouth
feel
a
beer
that
can
accompany
stew
or
be
drank
as
a
refreshing
end
of
the
dayer
d
i
great
session
beer
drinkability
medium
bodied
and
carbonated
overall
an
extremely
easy
drinking
beer
even
with
the
amount
of
malt
up
front
very
sessionale
i
cant
help
it
but
i
love
those
nitrocans
some
people
think
its
gives
a
false
impression
it
does
not
matter
to
me
i
love
how
this
one
pours
a
beautiful
bubbly
dark
amber
with
a
a
foamy
nitrocan
influenced
one
finger
beige
head
it
even
sounds
good
pouring
into
a
the
pint
glass
the
aroma
is
very
sweet
malty
and
appealing
to
me
it
has
a
kind
of
caramelhoney
sensation
on
the
nose
the
mouthfeel
is
bold
and
creamy
the
taste
is
also
sweet
and
special
with
a
kind
of
molasses
aftertaste
it
is
a
favorite
when
i
can
get
it
it
is
a
lot
like
many
english
ales
a
bit
bitter
but
easy
drinking
d
excellent
drinkability
well
balanced
beer
with
a
great
flavor
makes
me
want
to
keep
buying
pints
pours
a
clear
copper
color
12
inch
head
of
an
offwhite
color
good
retention
and
good
lacing
the
sound
of
the
pore
was
amazing
smells
of
roasted
malt
sweet
malt
slight
smoke
some
slight
yeast
cleanliness
and
some
nut
aroma
fits
the
style
of
a
scottish
ale
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
tastes
of
roasted
malt
up
front
some
sweetness
then
smoke
flavors
come
through
sweet
malt
and
hops
in
the
background
and
finishes
with
more
roasted
malt
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
with
a
nice
blend
of
flavors
and
a
general
smoothness
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
brew
d
good
medium
ale
thats
easy
to
drink
just
not
my
thing
d
would
i
have
another
sure
is
this
a
session
beer
maybe
not
but
none
the
less
enjoyable
for
sure
i
like
this
one
would
be
great
with
spicey
food
has
a
complex
flavor
that
changes
as
you
drink
it
starts
off
easy
and
gets
harder
towards
the
finish
you
can
taste
the
alchol
slightly
would
definately
do
again
pours
a
dark
amberbrown
and
slightly
clear
has
a
one
finger
light
tan
head
tan
remains
but
does
develop
a
good
collar
and
laciness
very
simple
aroma
malt
taste
is
more
complex
with
some
malt
a
little
sweetness
and
bitterness
without
any
hop
flavor
a
slight
cereal
grain
in
the
aftertaste
thin
and
watery
texture
light
body
nothing
special
about
this
beer
taste
is
average
but
i
would
have
another
one
this
beer
is
a
very
good
session
type
beer
for
the
person
who
is
not
a
big
hop
head
it
pours
a
medium
copper
and
has
a
nice
half
inch
head
that
dissipates
pretty
quickly
it
smells
of
malt
and
nuts
it
is
very
drinkable
with
an
aggressive
carbonation
it
tastes
of
malt
figs
and
a
hint
of
sugar
and
nuts
the
tastes
lingers
a
little
bit
on
the
back
end
and
there
is
no
bitter
hop
ending
perceivable
mfd
i
could
have
used
some
more
carbonation
and
viscosity
to
make
this
beer
a
bit
beefier
but
hey
i
could
also
chug
this
untill
ill
a
very
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
grew
finally
a
nitro
with
some
freakin
body
to
it
the
beer
had
a
medium
to
light
body
carbonation
was
right
the
beer
was
pretty
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
overall
a
good
beer
and
one
that
i
will
probably
pick
up
again
but
may
not
be
my
first
choice
d
goes
down
very
easily
especially
with
the
buttery
taste
and
feel
a
nice
quaffer
id
seek
this
out
again
over
some
poorly
made
craft
brews
but
if
i
were
in
the
mood
for
a
really
good
brew
id
overlook
this
overall
little
less
complex
then
some
scottish
ales
i
have
had
but
still
very
good
great
atmosphere
complexity
and
balance
defines
the
flavor
great
light
but
hearty
body
very
good
quaff
mouthfeel
light
body
with
a
clean
finish
somewhat
spritzy
carbonation
at
first
light
carbonic
bite
that
quickly
dissapates
as
the
beer
warms
very
slight
diacetyl
slickness
but
almost
complimentary
very
drinkable
12
oz
brown
bottle
offered
to
me
while
garage
sitting
with
a
friend
pours
a
crystal
clear
medium
rubyamber
with
a
dense
white
head
and
some
lacing
aroma
is
a
nice
the
mix
of
toasty
malts
toffee
caramel
with
some
notes
of
ripe
fruit
taste
is
a
smooth
blend
of
rich
toffee
and
biscuit
like
flavors
medium
carbonation
with
low
hop
bitterness
as
a
scottish
ale
should
be
very
enjoyable
nikki
this
is
a
great
brew
to
kick
back
and
drink
with
your
pals
while
hanging
at
the
pub
i
wish
i
could
find
a
place
in
point
that
had
it
drinks
nice
in
the
mouth
some
ashiness
at
the
finish
but
otherwise
ok
balance
and
dryness
define
this
beer
ok
drinkability
for
a
session
beer
that
this
is
nothing
exciting
about
it
or
even
freshness
prefer
others
made
in
the
usa
overall
the
mouthfeel
was
on
the
weaker
side
being
that
there
was
very
little
carbonation
but
overall
its
pretty
drinkable
due
to
the
fact
that
its
pretty
mild
and
has
no
overwhelming
qualities
a
classic
that
i
revisit
often
beautiful
bottle
underscores
the
brewerys
antiquity
id
like
to
know
more
about
how
this
particular
beer
has
changed
over
the
years
pours
a
clear
mahogany
with
a
small
tan
head
that
settles
very
quickly
yummy
aromas
of
complex
malts
spanning
the
spectrum
from
sweet
maple
syrup
and
toffee
notes
to
biscuity
to
toasty
malts
tastes
like
all
of
those
aromas
maltheavy
as
a
good
scottish
ale
should
be
with
a
slight
woodsy
bitterness
keeping
it
from
becoming
a
malt
bomb
absolutely
delicious
only
flaw
is
an
overcarbonated
body
but
thats
just
my
personal
preference
am
having
this
with
pate
and
crackers
and
loving
it
dark
brown
with
a
strong
one
finger
white
head
which
hangs
on
a
considerable
time
good
amount
of
lacings
aroma
is
caramel
malt
taste
is
dark
caramel
malts
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
just
enough
hop
bitters
to
balance
the
sweetness
mouthfeel
was
silky
smooth
and
that
made
for
an
easy
session
very
nice
ale
taste
light
smokey
maltiness
very
even
flavor
across
the
entire
tongue
silky
mouthfeel
and
easy
drinking
a
fuzzy
maple
brown
color
with
a
medium
offwhite
head
and
fair
lacing
the
aroma
is
nutty
earthy
and
buttery
with
a
mild
raisin
wine
hint
the
taste
is
a
bitter
caramel
malt
a
bit
thin
but
an
active
carbonation
there
is
a
sweet
cherry
lime
touch
over
a
malty
undercoat
its
nice
pretty
easy
drinking
too
not
much
alcohol
extremely
creamy
white
froth
of
a
one
finger
head
looks
more
like
a
smooth
plane
than
aggregation
of
microbubbles
heavy
lacing
clear
amber
red

consistent
in

bready
doughy

while
smooth
in
texture
comes
across
much
drier
than
expected
tea
leaf
grain
bitters
and
meadow
grasses
elevate
here
and
theres
a
white
citrus
zest
tackiness
as
well
that
said
never
loses
that
overall
smoothness
and
malty
appeal
of
toffee
bittersweet
chocolate
the
bread
yeast
components
choose
neither
side
fine
enough
quaffer
but
nothing
remarkably
memorable
about
it
d
i
enjoy
an
occasional
scottish
ale
and
this
one
is
very
drinkable
i
could
easily
drink
a
few
of
these
back
to
back
d
certainly
a
good
session
beer
in
the
winter
months
drinkability
is
somewhat
limited
do
to
the
intensity
of
the
flavors
and
mouthfeel
i
think
this
would
be
a
fine
beverage
to
pair
with
a
good
cut
of
steak
go
get
one
for
real
md
very
thin
on
the
mouthfeel
especially
compared
to
other
scottish
ales
that
i
have
had
a
passable
beer
but
far
from
one
of
my
favorites
cascading
head
effect
pouring
from
a
nitrocan
coppergolden
color
with
one
inch
of
dense
white
head
that
never
really
goes
away
moderate
amount
of
lacing
left
on
the
glass
has
more
of
an
english
hop
aroma
then
what
i
have
experienced
in
other
scottish
ales
i
absolutely
love
the
aroma
of
english
hops
a
little
earthiness
and
nuttiness
as
well
the
hops
also
play
a
large
part
in
the
flavor
the
hops
give
a
floral
and
earthy
quality
that
combines
well
with
the
slightly
nutty
and
smokey
quality
of
the
malt
has
a
creamy
texture
from
the
nitro
but
it
feels
a
little
thin
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
thanks
to
the
nitro
and
low
abv
love
the
hop
profile
as
well
definate
purchases
in
the
future
for
me
i
am
tired
of
companies
naming
their
bitter
a
scotch
ale
this
is
just
a
belowaverage
english
esb
in
disguise
pours
dark
amber
with
no
head
has
the
aroma
of
smoked
malts
and
caramel
but
thats
it
nothing
even
resembles
the
aroma
in
the
taste
flavor
is
flat
rotten
and
above
all
weak
its
also
expensive
avoid
pours
a
reddish
amber
color
body
very
clear
foamy
whitish
head
lasting
with
good
lacing
very
malty
aroma
almost
acidic
not
very
nutty
musty
might
be
a
characteristic
of
english
malts
kind
of
a
turnoff
for
me
malty
slightly
musty
flavor
some
banana
maybe
clove
pretty
clean
aftertaste
fruity
somewhat
creamy
pours
a
nice
chocolatey
orange
color
with
a
nice
foamy
head
smells
of
peat
and
nuts
and
has
a
slight
orangey
twang
on
the
nose
great
balance
to
this
beer
so
easy
to
drink
medium
bodied
with
a
spicey
dryness
at
the
end
malts
and
more
nutty
malts
keep
coming
very
good
session
beer
i
cannot
believe
i
had
never
given
this
one
a
whirl
before
d
this
is
very
similar
to
an
irish
ale
but
with
emphasis
on
malt
instead
of
hops
very
drinkable
would
love
to
find
an
establishment
that
has
this
on
tap
drinkability
an
easily
sessionable
scottish
ale
that
is
sure
to
please
this
one
intimidated
me
until
i
drank
it
and
i
must
say
i
really
enjoyed
it
not
too
rich
for
my
taste
but
an
excellent
interpretation
of
the
style
if
i
had
to
choose
one
word
to
characterize
this
beer
besides
sweet
id
call
it
mild
it
drank
very
easily
and
was
contrary
to
the
pubs
description
creamy
throughout
the
experience
i
didnt
notice
a
multitude
of
flavours
but
then
again
that
could
be
due
to
my
rather
inexperienced
palate
d
okay
on
the
drinkability
but
nevertheless
a
good
solid
beer
that
i
enjoy
often
d
one
of
the
better
nitro
beers
not
as
fullflavored
as
you
may
like
but
still
very
tasty
i
could
drink
this
all
night
long
and
probably
will
poured
a
dark
amber
eggshell
colored
head
on
top
was
about
two
fingers
high
after
a
moderate
pour
nice
thin
lacing
on
the
glass
smelled
of
sweet
malts
and
a
little
bread
taste
is
sweet
malts
mostly
with
a
little
nuttiness
also
a
hint
of
piney
hops
in
the
finish
to
make
a
delightful
bitterness
drinkability
tastes
great
lower
abv
medium
body
excellent
for
session
will
certainly
buy
this
again
first
time
ive
tried
belhaven
pours
a
nice
amber
with
thin
but
enduring
head
that
leaves
generous
lacing
gives
off
a
medicinal
malty
aroma
taste
is
of
toasted
malts
with
suggestions
of
chocolate
and
caramel
earthiness
and
eversosubtle
english
hops
emerging
towards
the
end
slick
mouthfeel
helps
make
this
a
very
drinkable
brew
good
stuff
but
not
my
favorite
style
these
go
down
a
bit
too
good
have
had
this
on
tap
in
the
boston
area
before
as
well
as
in
the
bottle
first
foray
into
the
nitro
can
not
bad
was
afraid
of
overcarbonation
but
you
get
the
trade
off
of
the
creamy
head
decent
brew
im
a
huge
fan
of
scottish
ales
ive
drank
many
of
them
and
this
is
a
pretty
good
one
its
a
little
light
in
the
color
and
flavor
but
still
not
bad
the
smokiness
and
dark
roasted
malt
flavor
is
not
present
like
in
most
scottish
ales
overall
i
like
this
beer
d
this
is
an
excellent
and
often
imitated
ale
i
found
it
to
be
very
easy
to
drink
and
quite
complex
for
its
size
would
make
an
excellent
session
beer
d
a
nice
brew
with
a
subdued
complexity
an
interesting
smoky
malt
backbone
id
certainly
drink
a
few
of
these
overall
though
really
enjoyed
the
difference
in
character
on
tap
and
definitely
quite
enjoyable
this
brew
from
the
bottle
has
a
lot
more
nuttiness
to
it
and
while
still
enjoyable
i
prefer
this
on
tap
certainly
one
i
will
have
again
d
a
good
quality
and
distinctive
ale
makes
me
want
to
try
more
scottish
ale
and
try
more
from
belhaven
for
sure
not
sure
if
i
could
drink
more
than
one
or
two
of
this
particular
brew
id
like
to
try
it
on
tap
i
used
to
really
enjoy
this
it
was
a
staple
of
mine
at
a
pub
though
my
tastes
have
changed
not
a
bad
beer
on
nitro
but
pales
in
comparison
to
cask
one
hell
of
a
show
errupts
after
pouring
a
large
belhaven
pub
can
into
a
pint
glass
a
large
mass
of
foam
settles
to
a
perfect
one
finger
white
head
that
doesnt
look
like
it
will
budge
anytime
soon
atop
with
dark
brownorange
brew
candy
sweet
malts
it
even
smells
like
a
beer
straight
from
the
tap
creamy
body
sweet
roasty
malts
much
better
than
a
bottle
this
drinks
incredibly
and
what
an
awesome
look
in
the
glass
as
you
get
down
a
few
sips
extreme
lacing
medium
fluffy
body
and
very
drinkable
i
think
im
in
love
to
me
it
had
a
sort
of
semi
sweet
woody
taste
that
i
reallly
enjoyed
not
very
hoppy
and
with
a
very
smooth
feel
had
several
and
cant
wait
to
try
other
ales
creamy
body
with
low
carbonation
smooth
but
not
flavorful
enough
for
the
thickness
of
the
body
very
easy
to
drink
serving
type
bottle
drinkability
is
perfect
alcohol
content
is
in
just
the
right
range
and
the
flavors
meld
perfectly
to
leave
you
wanting
to
quaff
another
this
would
make
a
perfect
session
beer
overall
a
very
quaffable
version
of
the
ontap
it
is
very
drinkable
and
i
would
gladly
have
seconds
and
thirds
d
a
well
mannered
gentlemen
and
enjoyable
i
could
drink
these
all
day
long
nice
this
beer
poured
a
nice
ruby
color
roughly
1
inch
white
head
to
it
there
is
a
scent
of
roasted
malt
that
finished
with
a
hint
of
hops
the
flavor
was
more
of
the
same
roasted
malt
with
a
nicely
balanced
hop
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
with
longlasting
flavor
very
good
scottish
ale
thisll
read
like
a
commercial

in

it
did
retain

malty

well
balanced

for

session
drinking
after
youve
had
more
than
a

is
a
spectacular

with

this
is
a
great
example
for
a
scottish
pub
ale
this
poured
a
clear
dark
mahogany
with
offwhite
head
it
smelled
like
watery
toffee
and
caramel
malts
with
wild
barley
and
slight
copper
hops
it
tasted
mostly
like
earthy
caramel
malt
with
a
hint
of
sour
cherry
and
copper
hops
it
was
watery
with
moderate
carbonation
and
had
a
bittersour
aftertaste
overall
this
was
a
good
old
fashioned
ale
that
was
easy
enough
to
drink
but
could
have
been
cleaner
d
a
nice
low
abv
malt
fix
with
a
beautiful
sweetness
its
too
bad
the
entire
brew
falls
apart
late
palate
this
is
the
beer
i
order
the
most
of
at
my
corner
pub
its
easy
to
drink
and
never
fails
to
put
a
smile
on
my
face
however
i
cant
help
but
thinking
its
not
a
scottish
ale
as
much
as
its
a
scottish
rendition
of
a
brown
ale
who
cares
its
fantastic
not
a
bad
beer
but
since
it
cost
me
a
whopping
12
bucks
for
a
six
pack
im
not
sure
ill
be
quick
to
come
back
to
this
one
great
drinkability
and
a
slippery
medium
body
make
this
drink
a
fine
one
for
sitting
about
shooting
the
breeze
deep
red
color
with
light
head
after
pouring
into
a
pint
glass
no
real
nose
that
i
am
able
to
pick
up
mild
maltiness
with
some
nutty
tones
in
the
flavor
a
solid
beer
but
not
one
of
the
best
scottish
or
scotch
ales
for
my
taste
i
rated
a
b
on
my
scale
d
slightly
thick
complex
i
could
drink
a
few
was
ok
beer
would
go
for
other
better
tasting
beers
in
the
future
tried
a
pint
on
tap
last
saturday
at
river
gods
in
cambridge
served
in
a
pint
glass
dark
molasses
colored
body
with
a
strikingly
white
head
smell
was
a
bit
of
roasted
barley
tasted
pretty
nice
with
a
combination
of
peat
fruit
and
wood
present
the
creaminess
of
it
is
definitely
a
plus
the
only
problem
i
have
with
this
beer
is
that
i
only
ever
want
to
have
one
its
a
bit
heavy
as
it
warms
up
and
by
the
time
i
get
to
the
bottom
i
really
dont
want
another
the
beer
gets
somewhat
chalky
after
a
while
its
a
nice
one
and
done
beer
but
it
always
tends
to
slow
me
down
a
bit
on
a
night
out
drinking
this
is
the
only
scottish
ale
that
i
have
reviewed
drank
most
similar
are
scotch
purchased
plaza
liquors
tucson
az
i
believe
that
i
officially
heart
belhaven
brewery
i
havnt
tried
a
brew
of
theirs
yet
that
i
didnt
like
served
this
one
chilled
in
a
pub
glass
poured
a
nice
reddish
gold
color
bloody
brilliant
smell
wasnt
as
bourbonish
like
the
other
brews
i
had
but
still
had
nutty
and
caramel
notes
as
well
as
some
balanced
hops
taste
was
a
little
more
bitter
but
still
had
that
caramel
malt
dominace
and
a
slightly
astringent
finish
a
beer
that
would
make
even
fat
bastard
proud
a
nice
surprise
i
bought
this
as
part
of
a
mixed
sixpack
from
my
local
liquor
store
having
never
tried
it
before
decent
carbonation
and
relatively
low
alcohol
level
make
this
quite
drinkable
the
aroma
is
nothing
special
perhaps
a
bit
nutty
with
a
bit
of
caramel
but
the
taste
is
very
smooth
the
mild
smokiness
was
very
very
pleasant
definitely
worth
drinking
again
drinkability
very
well
a
light
and
stimulating
drink
d
this
isnt
my
favorite
style
but
it
goes
down
quite
well
would
definitely
try
again
d
this
is
a
very
finely
crafted
brew
on
the
flip
side
i
probably
would
not
get
this
again
because
it
is
not
one
of
my
favorite
styles
if
i
were
at
a
traditional
eatery
i
wouldnt
mind
getting
this
to
accompany
a
meal
very
nice
d
complex
flavors
seem
to
match
well
with
other
scottish
ales
that
i
have
had
there
is
a
real
earthy
flavor
and
texture
that
certainly
makes
it
seem
believable
that
it
is
from
a
place
as
rugged
as
scotland
good
recommended
solid
orange
body
with
solid
halfinch
head
that
smooths
somewhat
evenly
in
a
samuel
smith

glass

and
hops
act
in
accordance
smooth
and
pleasant

and
effervescent
mellow
and
drinkable
by
the
lees
bitter

at
the
teeth
early
biting
with
a
hint

nuttiness
and
a
slight
smokiness
heavy
a
solid
strong
representation
of
what
id
expect
from
a
scottish
bitter
served
in
a
pub
has
a
friendly
feel
throughout
d
easy
drinking
session
beer
though
the
peaty
smokiness
is
not
for
everyone
d
very
high
drinkability
really
an
enjoyable
beer
d
so
thin
it
is
almost
like
water
it
doesnt
have
enough
flavor
to
make
me
choose
it
over
water
belhaven
is
deeply
malty
slightly
sweet
always
leaves
me
wanting
more
drinkability
is
slightly
above
average
a
4
pack
is
a
good
bet
recently
acquired
a
4
pack
of
these
in
the
nitro
can
while
not
as
impressive
as
i
remember
the
nitro
tap
this
is
still
a
very
well
rounded
brew
the
widget
creates
a
creamy
head
with
just
enough
crispness
flavor
is
sweet
and
toasty
not
too
strong
doesnt
try
to
over
do
it
and
succeeds
at
being
well
balanced
d
very
drinkable
lots
of
dark
malt
not
overly
complex
but
a
great
example
of
the
style
drinkability
would
recommend
this
beer
to
people
who
like
scottish
ales
very
drinkable
beer
very
drinkable
but
not
for
what
i
would
consider
good
reasons
it
is
quaffable
but
too
bland
maybe
its
the
widget
that
turns
me
off
this
beer
settled
with
a
thick
creamy
head
and
a
orangeamber
appearance
the
aromas
of
coffee
mocha
and
chocolate
were
the
main
attributes
i
sensed
from
the
beer
wicked
malty
and
sweet
wrapped
around
a
frappelike
thinnesscreaminess
the
mouthfeel
offered
a
perfect
balance
thin
but
creamy
overall
one
heck
of
a
scottish
ale
highly
recommend
a
nice
60
shilling
scotch
ale
poured
at
50
degs
into
pint
glass
very
clear
deep
amber
colour
with
nice
tight
head
aroma
was
mainly
malts
perhaps
a
tinge
of
sweetness
a
soft
smooth
maltiness
dominates
this
ale
the
body
was
a
bit
thin
for
my
tastes
and
the
finish
was
reasonably
dry
perhaps
a
small
bit
astringent
overall
a
nice
middle
of
the
road
scotch
ale
d
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
with
a
nice
low
abv
and
delicious
complex
qualities
highly
recommended
a
shining
example
if
a
scottish
ale
d
not
quite
what
i
expected
the
malts
were
not
quite
as
complex
as
i
would
have
liked
it
had
some
smokiness
but
the
aftertaste
was
just
not
appealing
i
didnt
realize
there
was
a
difference
between
a
scottish
ale
and
a
scotch
alewee
heavy
but
i
think
i
prefer
the
later
this
just
didnt
hit
the
malt
profile
i
was
hoping
for
not
bad
but
nothing
too
special
here
d
a
nice
ale
with
some
subtle
fruit
flavors
makes
this
an
easy
session
sipper
d
average
i
suppose
i
wouldve
liked
this
much
better
were
it
not
for
the
strange
aftertaste
worth
a
try
i
suppose
ill
revisit
if
i
see
it
on
tap
drinkability
a
good
beer
in
the
scottisk
ale
style
d
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
i
enjoyed
all
4
that
i
bought
pours
a
medium
amber
light
caramel
color
with
plenty
of
dense
white
head
and
excellent
tracing
great
clarity
as
well
aromas
are
quite
the
mix
of
toasty
malts
toffee
caramel
with
some
small
notes
of
chocolate
and
dark
fruits
on
the
palate
a
rich
toffee
and
biscuit
like
flavors
coat
the
mouth
with
its
medium
low
carbonation
a
slight
floral
finish
hints
at
noble
hops
but
bitterness
is
very
low
overall
a
very
enjoyable
beer
and
one
i
hope
to
duplicate
in
my
upcoming
homebrew
nice
amber
color
with
a
white
creamy
head
aromas
of
caramel
and
apples
with
a
slight
hint
of
roasted
malt
the
flavor
basically
carries
on
the
work
of
the
aroma
providing
a
silky
smooth
creamy
mouthfeel
to
boot
the
finish
is
both
fruity
and
biscuitlike
if
i
was
chuck
norris
i
would
drink
this
for
breakfast
with
cranberry
scones
and
clotted
cream
worth
a
shot
mfd
a
smooth
and
slightly
carbonated
feel
in
the
mouth
not
as
heavy
as
i
would
have
expected
well
balanced
and
very
drinkable
i
would
recommend
belhaven
scottish
ale
to
those
who
have
not
yet
tried
it
nice
as
a
session
ale
a
very
smooth
body
overall
with
the
malts
i
was
expecting
maybe
some
roasted
malts
or
the
usual
coffee
been
thrown
in
i
dont
know
but
it
tastes
fine
nonetheless
and
goes
down
great
as
the
backbite
is
a
tad
dry
from
the
hops
overall
a
great
mix
and
a
good
ol
session
brew
there
are
a
few
bars
here
and
there
that
put
this
on
draft
drink
this
if
youre
at
one
of
them
creamy
tasty
thick
creamy
head
smoky
aftertaste
somehow
the
taste
of
a
scottish
ale
seems
to
com
close
to
a
stout
had
it
on
tap
in
pennylane
in
richmond
it
goes
great
with
their
liverpudlian
fish
and
chips
good
times
ill
have
another
pints
of
those
i
might
like
this
better
if
matched
with
the
right
food
this
beer
is
just
a
little
too
sweet
for
me
to
drink
regularly
ive
had
it
on
tap
before
and
prefer
it
that
way
just
not
recent
enough
for
review
reddy
brown
pour
with
offwhite
head
that
hung
around
for
a
bit
not
a
fan
of
the
smell
of
this
at
all
and
was
different
from
any
other
bitter
style
beer
wasnt
bitter
at
all
but
smelled
and
tasted
kind
of
sour
and
sweetish
at
the
same
time
almost
a
sour
and
sweet
chocolateish
flavor
but
not
in
the
way
a
stout
is
chocolately
all
in
all
this
was
slightly
drinkable
but
i
wouldnt
do
it
again
on
purpose
pours
a
nice
orangeamber
color
with
a
tan
head
that
laces
the
glass
pretty
nicely
it
smells
of
sweet
malts
some
vine
fruits
and
scotch
it
has
a
nice
flavor
to
it
a
sweet
maltyfruity
beginning
turning
to
a
more
bitter
and
robust
scotchy
flavor
it
has
a
nice
smooth
mouthfeel
and
is
a
very
drinkable
scottish
ale
this
is
a
relaxing
beer
and
i
highly
recommend
it
d
nice
drinkability
can
drink
a
couple
at
a
time
extemely
smooth
compliments
of
the
widget
highly
drinkable
beer
quality
stuff
light
wafts
of
caramel
malt
and
mild
earthy
hop
and
yeast
tones
entice
my
nose
the
flavor
has
all
the
qualities
of
the
aroma
and
a
slight
ting
of
acidity
adding
a
slight
twist
its
silky
on
the
palate
and
going
down
this
is
an
easy
drinking
session
beer
that
still
has
ample
flavor
to
be
served
with
bbq
or
a
steak
d
high
drinkability
this
is
a
very
approachable
beer
light
pleasing
flavors
good
for
just
one
or
for
several
on
an
evening
a
good
beer
overall
i
think
id
fancy
a
5
2
version
d
excellent
i
could
drink
this
all
night
but
my
common
sense
tells
me
otherwise
perfect
for
a
cool
day
or
evening
would
go
well
with
a
hearty
meal
d
this
is
an
excellent
beer
and
a
classic
example
of
the
style
ive
heard
a
lot
about
this
beer
but
never
had
one
i
wish
i
had
tried
it
earlier
drinkability
the
ultimate
session
beer
nice
and
smooth
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
a
scottish
ale
this
is
a
fine
example
in
the
glass
this
beer
is
a
bright
clear
brassy
red
copper
color
with
a
thin
off
white
head
that
doesnt
really
do
much
of
anything
the
smell
is
full
bready
caramel
grain
a
bit
a
floral
hops
and
a
fair
dose
of
diacetyl
the
taste
is
upfront
graininess
fairly
buttery
sweet
with
a
definite
hop
bite
that
is
more
floral
spice
than
stinging
bitterness
underneath
there
may
be
a
bit
of
husk
or
burnt
grain
maybe
even
slightly
smokey
but
it
is
subtle
the
finish
is
a
touch
sweet
followed
by
a
quick
drying
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
light
and
tingly
maybe
a
bit
thin
while
i
feel
that
this
is
a
good
example
of
the
style
and
overall
a
good
beer
it
doesnt
really
strike
me
as
being
great
id
recommend
it
to
fans
of
the
style
or
englishscottishirish
beer
fans
in
general
but
for
me
it
is
missing
something
i
picked
up
a
17
fl
oz
bottle
of
this
at
the
local
beer
shop
the
other
day
the
beer
pours
a
nice
amber
with
a
fluffy
white
head
that
fades
quickly
it
is
pretty
light
in
the
smell
department
but
what
is
there
is
some
very
light
hops
with
and
malt
flavors
with
some
cooling
spices
the
beer
has
a
light
nutty
flavor
with
hints
of
caramel
and
nice
toasted
malt
presence
and
a
slight
slight
hint
of
hops
unfortunately
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
watery
and
a
little
over
carbonated
which
definitely
takes
down
the
drinkability
a
peg
or
so
overall
a
decent
beer
but
not
one
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
have
again
certainly
not
in
bottle
form
i
really
like
a
lot
of
belhavens
beers
and
scottish
beer
in
general
but
this
one
kind
of
left
me
flat
i
have
had
it
in
bottles
before
and
it
had
a
lot
more
flavor
the
nitro
can
seems
to
have
flattened
the
flavor
out
in
favor
of
smoothness
which
was
exceptional
for
a
scottish
ale
nice
but
not
something
i
would
buy
again
pours
a
dark
copper
color
with
a
nice
lace
of
head
smell
has
tons
of
caramel
aromas
taste
is
very
dank
with
caramel
aftertones
with
hints
a
floral
tones
also
bitterness
is
minimally
not
much
at
all
only
a
bit
in
the
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
with
light
carbonation
i
was
dissapointed
by
the
nitrodraft
version
so
im
hoping
the
bottle
is
better
here
it
goes
even
without
the
nitro
the
head
rises
nicely
and
the
retention
is
excellent
the
taste
is
better
too
sweet
smokiness
highlights
the
improved
flavor
medium
bodied
and
easy
drinking
overall
i
found
this
to
be
an
improvement
over
the
nitro
version
who
would
have
thunk
i
would
like
to
have
some
of
these
great
flavors
shown
off
in
the
smell
of
this
beer
the
taste
has
so
much
but
you
would
never
know
it
by
the
smell
overall
not
bad
it
was
a
very
solid
offering
from
belhaven
and
really
was
a
fine
drink
to
throw
done
with
dinner
not
sure
how
it
is
in
can
or
bottle
but
on
tap
very
fresh
and
very
indicative
of
the
style
a
quality
ale
for
sure
and
something
i
would
recommend
the
scots
know
how
to
drink
very
light
three
inch
carbonated
head
settles
in
foam
form
the
body
is
a
very
rich
amber
color
but
not
quite
opaque
you
can
definitely
see
the
heavy
yeast
content
good
presentation
significant
fruity
hop
smell
and
yet
a
good
malt
presence
the
taste
is
certainly
a
surprise
good
balance
of
hops
and
malt
definite
hops
dominant
with
a
very
good
fruithop
aftertaste
i
have
nothing
to
compare
this
ale
to
but
its
a
good
one
this
is
the
first
scottish
ale
id
ever
tried
and
i
didnt
know
quite
what
to
expect
it
had
a
dark
amber
appearance
with
little
head
to
it
there
was
a
breadlike
smell
along
with
some
malt
it
had
a
nice
nutty
taste
that
in
some
way
reminded
me
of
samuel
smiths
nut
brown
ale
overall
its
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
though
not
something
i
flipped
over
d
goes
down
easily
but
its
a
bit
on
the
heavy
side
another
fine
offering
in
the
of
the
month
club
thanks
dk
nice
deep

with
a
delicious
carmel
first
taste
on
the
tongue
as
scottish
ales
go
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
extremely
smooth
tasting
little
hops
except
to
provide
a
bit
of
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
and
the
nitro
can
is
a
lot
of
fun
because
you
get
a
gorgeous
bubble
show
like
a
guinness
along
the
sides
of
the
glass
after
the
pour
its
one
classy
beer
thats

3
of
those
ive

my
box

i
could
drink
this
constantly
great

prosit
mk
d
its
a
solid
beer
but
is
somewhat
light
on
tastecomplexity
still
as
a
lover
of
nitro
beers
i
could
see
myself
putting
a
few
of
these
away
very
sessionable
not
hard
to
drink
and
i
will
consider
picking
a
few
up
again
for
some
reason
this
is
the
first
time
trying
anything
from
belhaven
even
though
its
easily
available
this
is
a
quality
scotch
ale
that
is
a
joy
to
drink
on
these
cold
evenings
taste
mouthfeel
sweet
and
caramelly
with
a
buttery
quality
a
bit
mineral
as
well
mild
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
very
slick
mouthfeel

with
fairly
still
carbonation
the
creamy
head
adds
a
bit
of
richness
to
the
body

a
light
honey
brown
color
slight
haze
with
a
small
tan
head
that
dissipated
into
a
very
small
ring
around
the
glass
the
smell
is
of
caramel
malt
buttery
the
taste
starts
off
with
a
buttery
caramel
malt
then
an
earthy
bitterness
follows
i
only
pick
up
some
light
smoke
nutty
flavors
the
feel
is
fairly
light
and
quite
fizzy
finishes
with
a
slight
bitterness
a
pretty
easy
drinking
brew
it
is
a
bit
light
and
i
expected
a
little
more
complexity
to
it
definitely
worth
a
try
overall
this
review
is
uneven
as
i
have
never
had
a
nitro
fueled
scottish
ale
before
i
found
it
the
worst
part
of
the
beer
would
definitely
try
it
again
if
there
was
a
nongassed
version
if
there
is
im
sure
there
is
a
dandy
of
a
beer
behind
it
d
overall
i
am
a
fan
of
scottish
ales
just
not
this
one
but
i
do
see
that
people
who
enjoyed
it
in
a
nitrocan
or
ontap
had
a
much
better
experience
one
reviewer
said
with
the
nitro
this
would
just
be
an
ordinary
ale
ill
bet
he
is
spot
on
willing
to
give
it
another
try

a
scotch
ale
goes
down
nice
and
smooth
although
not
as
complex
as
a
wee
heavy
this
is
a
great
scotch
ale
to
try
if
you
dont
want
the
heavier
and
more
alcoholic
wee
heavy
taste
is
malt
maybe
a
bit
of
fruit
perhaps
a
tad
of
hops
but
pretty
much
just
malt
its
a
good
tasting
maltiness
ill
grant
you
that
but
not
special
whatsoever
this
beer
poured
a
clear
goldenamber
color
with
a
big
rocky
cream
colored
head
the
aroma
is
quite
malty
the
taste
is
smoky
with
a
large
dose
of
malt

nice
balance
the
mouthfeel
is
full
and
creamy
overall
the
flavors
and
mouthfeel
work
well
to
make
this
is
a
smooth
easy
drinking
scottish
ale
opened

standard

into
a
standard
pint
glass
from
a
12oz
bottle
very
little
headalmost
no
lacing
when
head
decipates
smells
of
malt
nothing
major
taste
is
standard
malty
as
expected
for
dark
color
of
beer
ok
mouthfeel
bubbles
would
not
make
me
to
have
more
than
a
couple
of
these
with
dinner
i
was
hoping
that
this
beer
would
give
me
the
inspiration
to
paint
the
face
bluewhite
and
pillage
i
just
feel
the
expereince
was
average
at
best
oh
well
d
pretty
good
certainly
worth
a
try
a
mild
esbesque
scottish
ale
definitely
toward
the
normal
side
of
scottish
ales
but
also
dry
not
bad
pours
a
nice
copper
amber
color
leaves
a
good
half
inch
head
throughout
the
glass
and
laces
very
good
i
can
not
get
too
much
from
the
smella
little
tad
carmel
but
the
malt
is
there
maybe
because
of
the
thick
head
the
smell
does
not
come
in
as
well
the
taste
thats
there
wonderful
medium
malty
goodness
that
is
fantastic
in
the
mouth
a
sweet
little
nutty
kick
as
well
in
the
back
end
i
like
to
take
in
some
of
the
head
as
i
drink
finishes
with
a
slight
bittering
hoppiness
to
end
a
great
tasting
scottish
ale
im
very
pleased
with
this
tasty
beverage
d
tasty
goes
down
very
easily
not
too
filling
decent
kick
good
representation
of
style
nice
beer
to
wind
down
with
after
a
good
meal
an
ideal
dessert
beer
for
sure
i
had
this
beer
over
at
the
brazen
head
in
brooklyn
ny
it
was
poured
from
the
tap
into
a
clean
pint
glass
the
beer
resembled
a
fine
guiness
as
it
settled
into
the
glass
an
impressive
sight
indeed
what
was
even
more
impressive
was
the
mouthfeel
and
taste
i
genuinely
enjoyed
this
beer
and
will
continue
to
drink
it
as
long
as
it
is
offered
at
the
head
steve
from
staten
island
can
you
tell
i
like
this
ale
despite
not
being
particularly
exceptional
in
aroma
or
taste
it
is
still
very
smooth
and
very
drinkable
drinkability
i
could
drink
this
ale
any
night
of
the
week
just
a
great
drink
i
love
it
not
anything
too
complex
just
an
over
nice
balance
of
flavors
to
create
a
great
scotish
ale
oelergud
m
not
bad
in
feel
but
would
have
expected
the
body
to
be
slightly
heavier
also
lacks
the
good
tingle
of
carbonation
appearance
is
a
nice
rich
amber
with
a
thick
creamy
head
that
just
wont
quit
aroma
is
malty
bready
and
id
have
to
say
the
same
for
the
taste
but
with
a
little
sweetness
from
the
malt
with
low
hop
and
carbonation
mouthfeel
is
medium
that
is
creamy
a
good
beer
nothing
special
but
one
to
try
originally
tried
this
brew
as
part
of
a
beer
of
the
month
club
and
have
wandered
to
it
every
now
and
again
this
beer
pours
a
deep
red
way
beyond
amber
with
a
solid
white
head
throughout
the
glass
smell
is
dry
crackers
bread
a
sweet
malty
tinge
taste
is
more
sweetness
preserves
and
jam
mixed
with
bread
though
the
dry
portion
of
the
beer
fails
to
match
the
sweetness
of
the
beer
i
wish
it
were
as
dry
and
hoppy
as
the
smell
first
indicated
beer
goes
down
sweet
and
smooth
a
decent
brew
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
the
beer
is
amazingly
drinkable
and
is
the
sort
of
beer
i
would
happily
drink
all
day
i
had
this
beer
after
a
10
dipa
and
the
delirium
tremens
yet
this
beer
still
held
its
own
in
the
flavor
department
just
an
amazing
beer
d
i
cant
find
enough
bad
to
say
about
this
beer
but
then
again
not
a
whole
lot
of
good
either
to
be
sure
this
offering
from
belhaven
is
above
average
but
im
not
really
sold
on
the
taste
perhaps
this
is
an
ale
meant
to
be
had
in
a
pub
backtoback
pints
i
could
see
myself
doing
that
but
after
the
second
id
probably
opt
for
something
else
d
solid
scottish
ale
but
a
bit
too
creamy
and
too
sweet
and
maybe
a
bit
too
boring
for
me
to
want
to
drink
it
a
lot
disclaimer
it
has
been
a
while
since
i
last
had
it
kinda
hard
to
find
poured
into
a
20
ounce
pint
a
nice
deep
amber
color
and
off
white
head
that
disapates
quickly
aromas
of
sweet
malt
and
a
small
hop
presence
the
taste
is
just
about
the
same
the
small
hop
bitterness
is
a
very
interesting
balace
to
the
beer
the
sweet
malt
makes
it
a
very
easy
beer
to
drink
especially
with
a
hop
bite
drinkability
is
stellar
i
could
drink
this
beer
all
afternoon
recommended
d
this
is
very
sessionable
with
the
emphasis
on
malt
its
not
cloyingly
sweet
because
the
hops
do
balance
the
malt
nicely
this
is
pretty
full
bodied
for
a
midlevel
ale
but
i
think
it
offers
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
your
standard
xpas
and
english
bitterspas
poured
from
a
16
9
oz
bottle
no
freshness
date
a
medium
redish
brown
color
with
a
one
inch
head
that
held
well
with
some
spotty
lace
bready
malt
aromas
with
a
hint
of
caramel
and
hops
taste
is
same
mouthfeel
is
very
very
smooth
and
light
with
a
light
carbonation
this
was
my
first
beer
from
belhaven
brewery
and
ill
be
looking
for
more
of
their
beers
d
on
tap
i
am
a
big
fan
and
will
gladly
come
back
to
it
i
still
dont
have
a
very
good
conception
of
the
shilling
strata
but
this
one
must
be
closer
to
an
80
or
90
a
good
deal
darker
and
more
complex
than
their
st
andrews
i
definitely
prefer
this
one
very
smooth
and
sessionable
while
having
a
lot
of
body
for
relatively
low
abv
overall
this
reminded
me
to
avoid
anything
scottish
apart
from
macallan
highland
park
and
aberlour
smooth
mouthfeel
balanced
and
easily
drinkable
yet
just
not
that
interesting
d
a
very
nice
beer
an
excellent
representation
of
the
style
nothing
amazing
in
terms
of
flavors
but
a
good
taste
that
goes
down
easy
belhaven
scottish
ale
was
a
nice
clear
redbrown
color
ith
had
an
offwhite
head
with
decent
retention
the
aroma
was
malty
the
taste
was
malty
and
a
little
toasty
with
a
hint
of
smoke
and
a
dry
finish
it
was
light
to
medium
bodied
with
plenty
of
carbonation
drinkability
was
good
its
a
good
beer
and
i
could
easily
have
several
of
these
in
sitting
this
is
one
fine
sessionable
scottish
ale
ive
always
liked
belhaven
but
this
is
the
first
time
ive
tried
the
nitro
can
its
surprisingly
good
the
taste
was
not
too
sweet
and
with
a
hidden
sharp
herbal
kick
it
drank
very
smoothly
with
just
the
right
bitterness
pours
an
amber
to
dark
copper
with
a
nice
creamy
one
finger
beige
head
floral
hop
esters
up
front
with
softer
notes
of
peach
apple
and
warm
buttery
caramel
very
mellow
nutty
profile
with
roasted
barley
caramel
brown
sugar
and
hops
offering
slight
peppery
spice
tea
herbals
and
a
little
spruce
nutty
to
sour
earth
tones
throughout
and
malt
and
honey
sweetness
gain
ground
towards
the
end
the
nuttiness
and
sourness
moves
into
the
finish
along
with
some
dryness
and
oaky
notes
but
fades
too
soon
thin
mouthfeel
and
creamy
on
a
vigorous
swill
is
really
enjoyable
tried
this
one
more
time
at
a
tasting
and
felt
like
an
idiot
very
good
beer
and
will
rereview
when
i
get
a
full
bottle
until
then
im
rating
all
4s
so
it
isnt
unfairly
rated
the
biggest
flavor
is
a
roasted
malt
flavor
with
a
sweet
backbone
that
lead
to
a
slight
dark
chocolate
finish
yum
this
was
thin
and
watery
but
not
in
a
negative
way
a
lot
of
scottish
ales
that
i
have
tried
were
a
bit
on
the
thick
side
but
this
one
wasnt
and
with
an
abv
of
5
20
perfect
for
sessioning
if
youve
got
it
i
was
so
disapointed
with
the
taste
of
this
beer
i
had
been
so
impressed
with
their
st
andrews
ale
but
this
was
not
that
taste
was
slighly
sour
and
watery
flavorless
i
thought
the
smell
was
good
with
a
nice
bready
yeast
fresh
bread
smell
but
that
is
about
the
best
i
can
say
about
this
one
will
not
buy
again
poured
a
coppery
red
with
a
tall
head
that
lasted
this
scottish
ale
was
lighter
in
color
than
many
of
the
us
versions
i
have
tried
that
are
reddish
brown
to
porter
brown
in
color
aroma
was
of
malt
with
a
hint
of
nuts
the
beer
had
a
rich
creamy
mouthfeel
and
tasted
like
sweet
malts
with
a
nutty
finish
hops
presence
was
light
with
a
mild
bitterness
that
was
pleasant
a
drinkable
beer
i
would
buy
it
again
harumph
this
brew
started
out
predictably
with
a
carmellike
nose
and
deep
golden
hue
unfortunately
that
was
the
best
part
the
beer
is
thin
and
has
a
strange
almost
metallic
taste
it
doesnt
improve
as
it
goes
either
this
is
not
a
very
good
beer
imo
i
really
like
the
weeheavy
but
i
wont
buy
this
one
again
d
excellent
drinkability
i
will
always
like
this
one
ive
had
the
nitro
can
version
of
this
and
far
prefer
that
to
the
bottle
while
admittedly
a
very
pretty
beer
the
taste
is
lacking
especially
for
the
genre
this
is
more
of
a
esb
than
scottish
ale
no
real
rich
malts
or
strong
burnt
sugars
or
any
peatiness
or
earthy
tones
outside
the
nose
im
actually
quite
bummed
out
outside
of
the
admittedly
pleasing
bitter
quality
there
isnt
much
here
too
bad
a
most
enjoyable
experience
drinking
this
brew
hearty
and
stiff
yet
sweet
and
complex
d
highly
drinkable
and
sessionable
and
what
a
session
it
would
be
though
not
my
preference
the
nitro
scottish
ale
thing
is
interesting
and
delicious
i
prefer
wo
nitro
but
im
still
recommending
this
brew
it
went
down
with
a
nice
creaminess
i
could
have
drank
a
few
of
these
in
one
sitting
an
extremely
creamy
brew
but
at
5
2
this
makes
for
a
decent
session
drinker
i
was
a
little
bummed
when
the
440ml14
9oz
can
ran
dry
wtf
is
up
with
440ml
just
make
it
an
even
500
geez
d
overall
a
decent
deer
this
is
something
i
come
back
to
every
now
and
then
drinkability
disappointing
and
fairly
unremarkable
drinkability
not
bad
but
all
in
all
nothing
outstanding
here
i
think
many
of
the
bottled
scottish
ales
are
better
and
offer
a
maltier
flavor
poured
a
nice
clear
copper
into
a
pint
glass
leaving
a
creamy
onefinger
light
beige
head
that
dissipates
to
a
film
but
leaves
lacing
as
you
go
smell
is
a
sweet
maltiness
some
caramel
and
cookie
there
too
the
taste
is
a
malty
smoothness
with
the
kind
of
creaminess
you
expect
from
a
good
ale
from
the
british
isles
balanced
out
by
a
slightly
dry
hoppy
finish
feels
a
little
thin
in
the
mouth
but
exceptional
drinkable
a
great
session
beer
and
one
i
love
to
have
around
this
ale
pours
a
rich
brown
and
a
thick
head
with
nice
retention
and
some
lacing
its
aroma
is
filled
with
malt
as
well
as
caramel
and
chocolate
qualities
the
taste
is
full
of
sweet
and
bready
qualities
with
a
little
bit
of
hops
very
candy
like
in
many
ways
it
has
a
good
medium
body
and
is
rather
creamy
the
finish
is
quite
dry
more
some
than
you
would
expect
very
drinkable
cheers
poured
a
cloudy
amber
with
big
head
and
a
lot
of

a
burnt

not
much
else
good
blending
on
the
taste
balancing
the
slight
malt
character
with
the
finish
slightly
watery
on
the
backend
all
in

clean
refreshing
and
unoffensive

solid

9
oz
bottle
into
a

glass
the
beer
poured
a
light
copper
forming
a
nice
1
12
inch
head
that
only
faded
slightly
leaving
very
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
sweet
with
a
slight
nutty
mix
to
it
the
taste
is
exceptional
nice
creamy
nutty
flavor
not
overpowering
but
just
enough
to
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
for
a
session
beer
this
one
ranks
at
the
top
very
easy
to
drink
highly
recommended
rich
malt
herbal
aroma
in
a
rich
redgold
pour
with
a
mousselike
head
taste
is
sweet
malt
upfront
with
just
enough
bitterness
to
offset
finishing
with
a
light
carbonic
bite
some
woodiness
in
flavor
and
faint
kettle
carmelization
light
mouthfeel
and
very
drinkable
i
happen
to
be
drinking
it
with
a
beef
stew
and
the
sweet
malt
offsets
the
salty
thick
stew
very
well
ill
admit
that
i
dont
know
much
about
this
style
but
as
far
as
off
flavors
or
unpleasantness
this
beer
doesnt
have
them
see
for
yourself
drinkability
not
bad
but
not
overly
impressed
i
would
love
to
try
this
brew
in
the
can
or
on
tap
i
think
it
would
improve
the
overall
release
of
flavors
and
smells
decent
and
recommended
served
in
a
presentable
16
oz

can
carmel
candy
sweetness
and
graininess
in
the
aroma
and
flavor
nice
reddish
hue
to
otherwise
brown
body
with
long
lasting
fluffy
head
very
inviting
creamy
smooth
mouthfeel
goes
excellent
with
the
flavor
profile
notes
ive
yet
to
be
dissapointed
and
will
continue
to
include
this
beer
among
my
favorites
anyone
interested
in
beer
at
all
should
give
this
a
try
whereas
it
can
be
easily
respected
for
its
fine
tuned
characteristics
and
high
quality
throughout
drinkability
is
excellent
this
is
a
very
nice
representation
for
the
style
it
would
be
very
easy
to
finish
a
fourpack
of
the
cans
during
a
football
game
or
movie
overall
a
pretty
drinkable
and
a
solid
brew
the
draft
can
got
to
love
them
anyway
the
mouthfeel
and
the
smell
of
this
beer
is
better
in
the
can
compared
to
the
bottle
the
creamy
head
on
the
beer
was
perfect
and
laced
heavily
on
the
glass
the
taste
was
of
earthy
meaning
oak
and
roasted
malts
light
on
the
hops
for
me
but
still
had
great
taste
in
my
book
it
is
a
good
medium
to
heavy
bodied
beer
that
you
can
enjoy
with
a
heavy
meal
mine
happened
to
be
pizza
had
this
at
dwyers
irish
pub
served
with
on
a
nitrotap
came
out
creamy
with
a
large
foamy
thick
head
that
dissipates
quickly
the
flavor
is
nice
and
mellow
a
nice
malt
dominance
theres
not
much
else
in
there
a
slight
hop
presence
but
notenough
to
balance
this
is
for
someone
who
wants
the
malty
beer
without
it
being
overly
sweet
the
body
is
medium
and
i
drink
this
all
night
when
im
out
easy
to
drink
and
had
enough
complexity
to
keep
my
interest
as
much
as
many
bigger
beers
this
was
my
first
scottish
ale
and
was
very
enjoyable
there
was
a
lot
of
depth
for
a
beer
that
is
quite
inexpensive
overall
however
this
beer
was
quite
flavorful
and
easy
drinking
pours
a
light
caramel
color
as
the
widgetdriven
cascade
does
its
thing
settles
into
a
clear
slightly
reddish
copper
color
topped
with
a
generous
amount
of
tight
offwhite
foam
nose
is
pleasant
enough
but
faint
until
the
beer
warms
a
bit
the
smell
is
highlighted
by
appetizing
lightly
caramely
malts
with
a
hint
of
hops
the
chewy
smoothness
of
the
mouthfeel
is
particularly
striking
and
actually
shows
some
hoppy
crispness
toomore
balanced
than
expected
and
making
this
more
drinkable
than
it
might
otherwise
be
taste
is
sweet
and
malty
with
some
nutiness
present
too
all
yielding
several
seconds
later
to
let
the
hops
join
the
dance
while
not
particularly
exciting
this
is
an
enjoyable
beer
poured
a
translucent
medium
brown
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
aromas
of
alcohol
taffy
and
roasted
malt
creamy
texture
but
not
much
beyond
that
hint
of
flavors
that
never
seem
to
come
together
not
very
flavorful
some
bitterness
in
the
finish
but
more
dry
than
anything
else
not
nearly
as
rich
or
as
flavorful
as
others
in
this
style
hell
of
a
drinkable
brew
if
it
were
on
tap
id
be
all
over
it
d
excellent
d
tasty
beer
but
not
really
something
im
going
to
go
after
again
there
are
better
scottish
ales
out
there
overall
id
try
this
again
and
give
it
another
shot
but
i
really
was
not
impressed
beer
poured
orange
with
a
nice
bubbly
long
lasting
head
nose
has
a
malty
woody
and
nutty
notes
taste
has
some
complexity
to
it
definitely
malty
somewhat
nutty
but
there
is
a
slight
apple
hop
finish
to
this
i
am
not
sure
if
this
is
a
pale
or
scottish
ale
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
medium
bodied
drinkability
is
good
this
is
a
pretty
interesting
beer
kind
of
different
and
definitely
worth
a
shot
drinkability
a
session
beer
doesnt
go
to
hard
on
the
taste
buds
a
good
cold
weather
beer
probably
a
good
session
beer
but
i
prefer
a
stronger
taste
than
this
one
very
drinkable
though
a
good
one
to
have
if
you
want
to
for
go
the
usual
stout
fare
opinion
i
am
really
enjoying
this
beer
this
time
i
have
had
it
in
the
past
but
never
on
such
a
fresh
palate
i
like
the
malt
complexity
and
in
some
ways
it
rivals
some
traditional
german
bocks
this
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
and
one
that
i
would
definitely
drink
again
this
brew
is
extremely
quaffable
though
and
that
makes
up
for
the
watered
down
mouthfeel
a
little
i
really
like
this
one
alot
but
i
feel
like
it
could
have
been
better
almost
there
but
falls
short
pours
a
crystal
brown
color
smell
is
basically
nonexistent
with
a
hint
of
malt
the
taste
is
firmly
in
the
malt
column
and
though
there
is
some
talk
of
hops
on
the
bottle
the
carbonation
however
is
perfect
for
the
style
very
light
and
serves
as
a
terrific
foil
for
the
malt
really
tasty
beer
that
takes
the
edge
off
can
see
myself
drinking
this
more
and
more
not
sure
of
any
pubs
that
serve
in
my
area
this
treat
but
will
keep
my
eyes
out
highly
reccommended
if
you
can
find
it
i
was
fully
expecting
a
weeheavy
type
ale
theirs
is
very
good
but
that
is
not
what
this
beer
is
reddishamber
body
with
initially
fingerthick
head
that
dissipates
smells
malty
like
a
scotch
ale
or
a
wee
heavy
tasty
malty
with
some
muted
hop
tastes
similar
in
some
ways
to
old
speckled
hen
but
not
quite
as
strong
and
way
better
mouthfeel
drinkability
this
beer
has
a
very
creamy
mouthfeel
the
beer
is
well
carbonated
the
beer
doesnt
have
any
extreme
flavors
present
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
i
think
i
would
pick
this
one
over
guiness
any
day
of
the
week
this
has
just
become
my
new
sessionable
beer
my
definition
of
a
scottish
ale
is
a
belhaven
that
said
the
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
light
tan
head
i
wasnt
too
impressed
with
the
smell
maybe
it
smells
better
off
tap
and
the
nitrocan
affected
the
smell
somehow
but
this
beer
tastes
like
pure
malt
with
some
mild
nut
and
other
flavors
it
goes
down
easy
as
well
i
could
find
myself
drinking
3
or
4
of
these
in
a
night
i
wasnt
expecting
to
be
so
pleased
by
this
beer
in
fact
i
almost
didnt
bother
picking
it
up
even
though
it
isnt
available
here
now
i
wish
i
had
gotten
two
a
highly
sessionable
scottish
ale
and
one
thats
always
refreshing
to
drink
a
very
mild
but
interesting
and
complex
brew
well
worth
a
try
very
tasty
beer
maybe
the
best
beer
i
have
ever
had
out
of
a
can
nice
body
that
looks
like
caramelized
wine
decent
finger
wide
head
nose
is
grainy
caramel
with
a
hint
of
sugary
sweetness
taste
is
dry
caramel
syrupy
sweetness
nice
but
id
like
a
bit
more
complexity
mouth
is
big
and
thick
i
suppose
i
could
happily
drink
this
but
id
reach
for
many
others
of
the
same
style
in
its
stead
coppercolored
pour
from
a
12
oz
bottle
malt
aroma
and
flavor
present
from
the
start
drank
with
a
plate
of
hot
wings
so
admittedly
some
of
the
senses
were
alittle
dulled
but
for
a
low
alcohol
beer
this
was
very
tasty
and
drinkable
had
a
good
finish
that
was
still
evident
despite
the
food
spices
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
with
a
thick
foamy
head
which
surprisingly
held
up
through
out
with
nice
lacing
as
well
there
is
a
nice
malty
nose
to
the
beer
and
it
has
a
dark
copper
color
it
has
a
smooth
creamy
mouthfeel
and
a
roasted
malty
flavor
to
it
theres
a
certain
earthiness
to
it
which
ill
assume
comes
from
the
roasted
malt
and
nut
flavors
overall
a
fine
beer
though
in
the
heat
of
summer
good
for
a
sample
rather
than
a
couple
i
could
imagine
having
a
few
more
of
these
during
the
late
fall
when
a
rainstorm
has
forced
me
to
stay
inside
really
good
scottish
ale
im
a
hophead
so
i
went
into
this
pint
with
a
bit
of
trepidation
i
neednt
have
worried
this
is
a
very
nicely
made
beer
almost
precisely
what
one
would
expect
a
scottish
ale
to
be
malty
creamy
almost
no
hops
to
speak
of
yet
infinitely
drinkable
very
good
example
of
the
style
and
worth
seeking
out
very
enjoyable
sweetness
from
the
malts
caramel
smoke
and
some
trace
amounts
of
bitterance
from
the
hops
are
apparent
upon
tasting
finishes
kind
of
crisp
which
is
unexpected
it
is
smooth
but
its
kind
of
on
the
watery
side
and
the
carbonation
is
very
light
i
wont
say
its
bad
but
i
wasnt
impressed
and
i
dont
think
ill
be
visiting
this
one
again
for
a
while
ph
the
beer
poured
a
most
remarkable
dark
gold
like
a
fine
whiskey
with
a
good
bit
of
off
white
head
the
aroma
was
of
good
scotch
malt
the
taste
was
mainly
of
malt
but
with
just
a
little
hops
in
the
finish
to
round
it
out
nicely
the
feel
was
medium
and
a
bit
dry
and
oily
this
was
a
very
enjoyable
ale
it
gave
me
all
i
look
for
in
a
scottish
ale
with
a
big
malt
taste
and
added
just
enough
hops
i
enjoyed
this
while
eating
a
steak
blackened
with
cajun
spices
and
topped
with
blue
cheese
the
ale
met
my
expectations
and
held
up
to
these
strong
tastes
complimenting
them
nicely
d
good
for
sipping
flavors
arent
overwhelming
pours
a
clear
copper
under
a
one
figner
offwhite
head
that
fades
slowly
and
with
nice
creamy
contour
leaving
some
good
lace
strings
the
nose
is
nicely
balanced
between
fruity
malt
and
floral
hops
the
mouth
is
fairly
wellcarbonated
and
rather
light
with
just
a
touch
of
stickiness
mild
taste
impression
at
first
fronted
by
some
plum
along
with
smooth
bready
malt
the
hops
surge
forth
at
the
finish
particularly
as
it
warms
with
a
hint
of
espresso
to
go
with
the
dominant
floral
tone
the
aftertaste
is
very
mild
with
just
a
touch
of
dry
bitter
this
is
a
solid
if
unexciting
brew
very
drinkable
a
nice
beer
not
a
strong
flavor
or
much
carmelization
but
a
good
beer
all
the
same
this
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
does
not
leave
you
wanting
however
some
may
find
the
thick
and
smooth
mouthfeel
not
a
really
great
choice
as
a
session
beer
i
would
disagree
the
beers
great
quality
is
that
it
is
balanced
well
and
i
could
have
several
of
these
in
a
sitting
ive
had
the
mid
to
lower
shilling
belhavens
on
cask
in
scotland
so
it
is
difficult
to
give
this
nitrocan
version
a
completely
unbiased
review
however
prior
experience
aside
the
chunks
floating
around
in
the
body
of
this
ale
were
a
serious
turnoff
there
was
also
a
slight
tartness
that
may
be
attributable
to
spoilage
hopefully
this
is
an
isolated
phenomenon
and
ill
report
back
on
the
other
three
cans
in
the
4pack
otherwise
this
a
nice
middle
of
the
road
scottish
ale
with
a
tasty
emphasis
on
the
malt
considering
american
examples
of
the
lower
shilling
scottish
ales
are
rather
hard
to
come
by
its
nice
to
see
this
being
imported
easy
drinker
thats
worth
a
try
cheers
very
easy
to
drink
and
quite
refreshing

such
a

ive
been
enjoying
this
style
lately
since
one
of
the
stores
i
shop
at
has
expanded
its
selection
drinkability
considering
the
weight
of
the
malt
content
this
is
surprisingly
drinkable
not
too
syrupy
or
sticky
in
the
least
verdict
a
little
thin
but
its
a
good
sturdy
scottish
ale
its
certainly
worth
a
try
pours
out
a
clear
dark
amber
with
a
frothy
head
that
dissipates
into
fine
lacing
along
the
sides
of
the
glass
smells
of
nutty
grains
and
peatsmoked
malt
with
a
slightly
offputting
metallic
tinge
tastes
nutty
and
smokey
with
a
robust
hopping
in
the
finish
the
flavors
present
remind
me
exactly
of
some
smoked
almonds
i
had
earlier
today
mouthfeel
is
light
and
slightly
bubbly
which
makes
this
a
quite
quaffable
scottish
ale
extremely
drinkable
this
is
a
well
put
together
beer
that
makes
me
want
to
try
the
nitro
version
soon
highly
reccomended
simple
but
tasty
overall
has
some
elements
id
actually
expect
from
my
singlemalt
scotches
which
isnt
a
bad
thing
at
all
surprisingly
light
feeling
considering
the
heft
and
weight
of
the
flavors
if
you
are
looking
for
the
perfect
accompaniment
to
fried
breaded
portions
of
chicken
or
pork
cutlets
than
you
might
give
this
beer
a
try
the
amberbutterscotch
hue
gives
way
to
a
reasonable
white
smooth
head
the
aroma
of
honey
roasted
chestnuts
leads
to
a
similarly
nutty
like
flavor
with
a
finish
milder
than
most
scottish
style
ales
but
slightly
hoppy
none
the
less
ample
body
dictates
its
ability
to
be
enjoyed
as
an
ale

5so
in
my
endeavors
to
broaden
my
beer
tastes
i
decided
to
pick
up
a
four
pack
of
belhaven
that
and
the
fact
that
i
have
never
had
a
beer
in
the
nitro
can
before
so
i
popped
the
nitro
can
and
like
the
gun
shot
at
the
start
of
the
race
the
nitro
took
effect
and
produced
a
nice
head
in
the
can
i
poured
this
tan
to
even
light
brown
brew
into
my
glass
it
had
a
small
white
head
that
was
pretty
thick
the
smell
was
sweet
and
malty
but
it
was
kind
of
hard
to
pick
them
up
the
taste
was
at
first
puzzling
it
was
not
really
what
i
expected
it
was
very
mellow
and
not
in
your
face
it
took
me
a
couple
sips
to
see
the
true
character
of
this
beer
the
sweetness
and
slight
smokey
flavor
are
noticeable
on
further
inspection
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
and
is
not
a
bad
choice

than
the
standard

after

im

ill
have
more

copper
beer
with
decent

the
smell
is
wonderful
a

the
flavor
is
all
about
malt
which
seems
par
for
course
with
the
style
theres
more
of
a
slight
tartness
than
any
discernible
hop
flavor
honey
and

are

add
some

to
that

youve

you
like

i
sure
do
d
do
not
think
i
could

a
pint
myself
little
disappointed
that
this
beer
has
sullied
the
good
name
of
belhaven
o
an
awesome
scotch
ale
it
has
all
the
requisite
characteristics
in
moderation
without
being
aggressive
very
easy
drinking
and
above
all
a
great
tribute
to
a
place
i
must
visit
some
day
a
rather
tweedy
very
dry
strong
ale
lacking
a
bit
of
congeniality
im
not
upset
i
bought
this
one
but
i
doubt
ill
buy
it
again
worth
a
try
but
i
wouldnt
go
searching
for
it
overall
while
not
great
every
aspect
of
the
beer
is
better
than
average
it
is
not
as
complex
as
i
was
hoping
but
then
again
i
do
not
have
much
experience
with
scottish
ales
the
smoky
aftertaste
was
perhaps
the
most
pleasantly
interesting
aspect
of
this
brew
its
not
world
class
but
im
glad
i
had
it
overall
a
nice
representation
of
the
scottish
ale
style
very
easy
to
drink
with
a
nice
balance
of
the
earthycitrusy
flavours
would
definitely
pick
up
another
in
future
it
lacks
balance
this
thats
not
to
say
its
bad
no
its
actually
pretty

fine

its
one
two
or
maybe
three
dimensions
but
it
is
such
a
wasted
opportunity
its
very
soft
brown
malty
toffee
morish
quality
with
just
a
pinch
of
earth
is
pretty
close
to
exceptional
but
its
just
too
much
for
me
needs
more
structure
up
and
down
and
more
development
from
beginning
to
end
overal
this
is
an
exceptional
ale
and
i
recomend
it
to
anyone
who
can
get
it
i
lucked
out
as
the
case
had
been
droped
and
3
were
broken
so
i
got
it
for
a
very
nice
price
this
is
so
tasty
i
am
going
to
get
their
scotish
ale
soon
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
golden
color
some
floaties
in
there
along
with
a
fluffy
white
head
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
malty
and
grainy
along
with
some
toasted
nut
aromas
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
a
little
sweet
upfront
from
the
grains
in
it
the
aftertaste
has
a
decent
bitterness
to
it
the
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
and
easy
to
have
a
few
in
a
short
amount
of
time
overall
i
like
this
beer
i
had
it
once
and
would
be
willing
to
have
it
again
often
this
particular
style
can
come
off
as
bland
i
was
happy
to
find
that
this
beer
is
not
bland
at
all
it
has
a
nice
strong
toasted
malt
flavor
without
being
too
sweet
moreover
it
has
considerable
body
for
a
beer
of
this
style
the
toasty
flavors
were
nicely
complemented
by
a
nice
earthy
nuttiness
and
hints
of
molasses
and
clover
a
nice
beer
for
a
cool
rainy
afternoon
overall
quite
good
for
the
style
definitely
worth
drinking
and
easy
to
do
such
in
quantity
dr
nice
but
better
belhaven
offerings
are
available
at
comparable
prices
drinakbility
for
a
beer
dedicated
to
st
andrew
and
the
home
of
golf
this
one
would
be
well
suited
on
the
links
easy
to
drink

if

i
guess
its
my
third
scotland
beer
bittersweet
and
highly
recommended
definately
a
drinkable
and
enjoyable
beer
but
as
on
caught
somewhere
between
the
english
pale
and
scottish
ale
the
beer
has
characteristics
of
both
but
dont
settle
the
score
of
either
definitely
has
a
nice
light
mouth
feel
a
rusty
caramel
sweetness
and
possibly
a
bit
of
vanilla
sweetness
has
a
tartness
on
the
sides
of
the
tongue
and
a
light
smooth
mouthfeel
drinkabilitly
this
is
a
unique
beer
for
me
the
color
was
different
and
the
aroma
and
flavoring
were
very
similar
all
in
all
i
liked
the
change
definitely
was
not
what
i
was
expecting
when
i
picked
this
brew
up
i
could
sit
down
with
this
for
an
evening
for
sure
for
me
however
i
probably
wouldnt
drink
this
two
nights
in
a
row
i
have
a
feeling
this
is
an
old
style
beer
i
am
glad
i
tried
it
d
nice
enough
a
good
twistimprovement
on
belhaven
best
consumed
in
st
andrews
lending
an
appropriateness
to
its
consumption
the
body
is
full
wholesome
and
smooth
in
the
mouthfeel
some
might
prefer
a
hop
presence
but
to
me
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
actually
bought
this
in
st
andrews
im
glad
i
did
d
nice
brew
to
drink
by
itself
however
for
the
price
probably
not
a
session
beer
would
recommend
for
those
that
like
euro
styles
for
sure
d
easily
quaffable
and
satisfying
recommended
overall
this
is
a
well
balanced
and
fairly
mellow
beer
that
is
easily
sessionable
i
would
drink
this
again
an
nice
but
not
extraordinary
scottish
ale
updating
my
rating
of
this
now
ive
tried
the
bottled
version
on
tap
this
is
a
mellow
rounded
esb
with
a
fair
body
and
bready
finish
the
bottle
version
is
weaker
in
character
and
has
a
few
sharp
edges
to
it
ill
buy
it
on
tap
but
never
as
a
bottled
import
not
worth
the
price
downgraded
1
3
on
the
bolled
version
a
flavorful
easy
drinker
very
nice
body
is
medium
to
light
slightly
sticky
enjoyable
the
malt
profile
ranges
from
slightly
sweet
to
toast
to
even
a
bit
of
roast
there
is
almost
an
oaky
wood
flavor
i
am
getting
for
some
reason
pretty
basic
beer
really
i
dont
get
a
whole
lot
of
complexities
and
the
mouthfeel
is
bordering
on
watery
sessionable
but
the
price
tag
makes
that
unreasonable
at
almost
5
bucks
a
half
liter
this
is
definitely
one
of
those
british
beers
that
need
to
warm
up
before
enjoying
properly
its
a
decent
pint
of
ale
that
is
better
than
your
standard
british
pub
taps
final
thoughts
an
excellent
offering
if
you
want
a
simple
flavorful
and
easy
to
drink
beer
as
i
said
this
would
be
great
after
a
round
of
golf
as
its
refreshing
but
not
at
the
cost
of
its
body
and
flavor
thumbs
up
on
this
one
d
the
low
alcohol
and
great
flavor
and
low
carbonation
make
this
one
as
drinkable
as
they
come
d
this
is
a
nice
scottish
overall
im
very
glad
i
picked
it
up
the
low
abv
allows
it
to
go
down
easy
overall
this
is
an
easy
drinking
scotch
ale
with
wonderful
flavors
on
the
light
side
i
think
its
what
a
scotch
ale
named
for
a
golf
course
should
be
its
light
with
waves
of
floral
and
honey
and
i
have
no
idea
how
they
got
the
sandy
look
to
the
head
but
it
certainly
looks
like
a
st
andrews
sand
trap
st
andrews
is
believed
to
be
where
the
first
game
of
golf
was
played
the
beer
that
bears
its
name
is
not
the
be
all
and
end
all
of
ales
but
like
the
course
itself
is
the
sum
of
hundreds
of
years
of
tried
and
tested
development
nurturing
and
tradition
i
dont
know
that
this
ale
would
be
every
beer
drinkers
dream
but
its
definitely
above
err
below
par
lcbo
acquisition
pours
copper
body
with
some
white
foamy
head
that
sticks
to
the
glass
on
the
way
down
pleasant
mild
hoppy
aroma
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
below
average
but
it
is
also
very
easy
drinking
a
serviceable
esb
sourish
at
the
sediment
of
the
bottle
d
a
standard
80
shilling
type
ale
a
good
malt
backbone
not
overly
tasty
but
certainly
wouldnt
refuse
one
solid
drinkabiliy
with
an
inoffensive
flavour
profile
drinkability
i
enjoy
this
beer
as
wellcrafted
and
refreshing
there
are
a
few
characteristics
of
which
i
just
dont
happen
to
be
a
fan
but
that
doesnt
mean
this
is
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
bottle

too
medium

some
fruits
a
little
hops
but
overall
very
malty
a
little
sweet
and
with
a
spicy
aftertaste
very
smooth
and
drinkable
especially
due
to
the
very
low
carbonation
which
also
makes
it
appear
a
bit
watery
ive
tried
this
a
few
times
now
and
would
drink
it
again
really
fits
my
taste
poured
into
a
shaker
pint
glass
poured
a
clear
copperamber
color
with
a
small
offwhite
head
that
quickly
goes
to
a
thin
film
with
minor
lacing
ive
seen
others
mention
a
buttery
aroma
in
their
reviews
and
up
till
now
i
have
not
found
that
scent
in
a
beer
i
get
a
light
buttery
toffee
aroma
very
pleasant
a
light
toffee
sweetness
and
citrusy
flavors
finishes
clean
i
really
enjoy
this
ale
would
love
to
find
it
on
tap
drinkability
is
very
good
for
this
is
a
tasty
ale
mouthfeel
i
dunno
kind
of
bland
for
my
tastes
drinkable
enough
if
the
cost
wasnt
so
high
an
excellent
standard
in
drinking
ale
solid
across
the
board
beer
with
neither
hopmalt
notes
being
the
main
component
of
the
flavor
solid
purchase
and
very
sessionable
feel
and
drinkability
this
one
is
medium
bodied
with
delicate
and
light
carbonation
due
to
lighter
carbonation
this
one
feels
smoother
and
creamier
on
the
palate
easy
enough
to
drink
but
i
think
id
have
to
be
in
the
mood
for
this
beer
to
go
ahead
and
drink
a
couple
of
these
in
one
sitting
this
is
one
rich
beer
and
ill
definitely
enjoy
the
rest
of
the
glass
nothing
to
rush
out
and
get
but
definitely
worth
a
try
not
bad
at
all
certainly
worth
a
pick
up
taste
is
a
little
watery
peat
caramel
a
touch
of
sour

a

finish
finish

adding
to
drinkability
minimal
hops
mouthfeel
is
full
and
round
and
drinkability
is
high
again
due
to
dry
finish
quite
a
bit
of
character
here
drinkability
not
the
best
scottish
ale
but
certainly
nothing
to
turn
your
nose
up
at
either
you
could
do
a
lot
worse
i
just
feel
that
this
ale
doesnt
have
quite
the
character
as
a
lot
of
other
scottish
ales
none
the
less
still
very
good
and
not
to
be
passed
up

drinkable
sessionable
brew
as
i
finished
this
one
up
i
couldnt
help
but
think
that
its
no
superior
to
local
offerings
but
carries
a
bigger
price
tag
the
carbonation
really
screws
it
up
and
i
would
expect
more
from
belhaven
despite
them
being
a
hitormiss
brewery
for
me
score
this
one

bogey

with

great
carbonation
thought
not
bad
and
quite
drinkable
overall
its
a
really
nice
ale
with
a
sizeable
amount
of
flavor
for
a
lower
abv
beer
which
would
make
this
a
preeminently
sessionable
scottish
ale
all
in
all
this
was
quite
nice
beer
very
sessionable
and
refreshing
if
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
this
beer
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
amber
color
with
a
small
white
head
that
recedes
to
lacing
the
aroma
brings
a
nice
caramel
malt
to
the
nose
with
a
bit
of
floral
hops
the
taste
really
brings
the
caramel
malt
flavor
to
the
front
the
full
mouthfeel
and
good
co2
make
this
a
pretty
tasty
drink
d
wonderful
depth
and
complexity
especially
given
the
sub5
abv
i
could
enjoy
a
couple
of
these
in
a
sitting
and
would
gladly
seek
out
and
purchase
again
in
the
future
a
tad
more
sweetness
on
the
palette
would
have
made
this
a
homerun
but
otherwise
nicely
done
d
very
good
and
it
gets
better
as
it
warms
in
the
glass
i
could
session
this
beer
its
got
enough
going
on
to
keep
me
interested
without
being
too
much
on
a
warm
day
it
may
be
a
bit
much
for
a
lawnmower
beer
future
outlook
perfectly
decent
beer
that
i
would
never
refuse
though
no
reason
to
seek
out
specifically
drinkability
very
drinkable
would
make
a
great
session
beer
d
lighter
and
easier
drinking
than
other
scottish
ales
ive
had
and
not
quite
so
intense
still
full
of
flavor
and
character
the
taste
is
quite
flavorful
there
is
plenty
of
bready
sweet
malts
underneath
there
is
some
honeyed
sweetness
to
the
beer
there
is
some
tart
apple
and
roasted
caramel
tastes
and
there
is
just
a
touch
of
some
bittering
hop
more
towards
the
finish
to
round
the
beer
out
the
mouthfeel
is
not
overly
creamy
or
crisp
and
the
aftertaste
is
very
mild
this
is
a
lighter
bodied
beer
not
watery
with
plenty
of
character
that
is
worth
seeking
out
lchaim
d
this
beer
has
a
nice
malt
flavor
with
some
fruity
flavors
and
a
good
but
subtle
depth
the
hops
are
soft
in
flavor
but
had
a
nice
bitterness
to
the
finish
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
and
would
make
a
good
session
beer
conclusion
finishes
just
a
bit
too
minerallyhoppy
for
the
style
for
me
otherwise
this
is
a
damn
delicious
scottish
ale
overall
i
love
it
its
a
great
twist
on
an
old
style
that
belhaven
pulls
off
well
just
a
wonderful
way
to
pay
homage
to
the
home
of
golf
drinkability
is
wonderful
the
complexity
of
the
flavors
and
smells
keep
you
guessing
and
keep
you
from
getting
bored
pours
a
light
brown
colored
body
with
a
white
colored
head
has
an
ipaish
aroma
nice
and
hoppy
has
a
pale
taste
very
plain
clean
and
balanced
this
would
make
a
good
session
beer
not
too
strong
a
flavor
to
get
sickening
after
a
while
this
beer
pours
a
nice
burnt
orange
hue
with
lots
of
thin
foamy
white
head
the
smell
is
very
light
caramel
malt
the
taste
is
sweet
biscuity
malt
with
a
small
amount
of
fruity
floral
hops
the
carbonation
is
mild
and
the
finish
dry
this
certainly
is
an
easy
drinker
and
a
decent
session

a
nice

balanced

all
around

sometimes
i
wish
i
grew
up

young

outstanding

is

similar
to
the
smell
very
good
anyway
with
lots
of
rosted
malts
and
some
notes
of
pears
i
did
try
this
again
and
i
liked
it
much
better
still
not
great
but
not
bad
either
i
wonder
if
the
first
bottle
i
tried
was
just
bad
i
liked
this

stuck
around
for
a
minute
or
two
aroma
is
very
inviting
with
apple
pear
and
an
awesome
yeastiness
the
taste
isnt
as
fruity
and
glorious
as
the
incredible
aroma
but
it
is
nice
and
earthy
there
is
a
great
toastiness
to
it
and
great
caramel
bread
and
diacetyl
butter
flavor
the
more
i
drink
the
more
i
taste
the
yeast
this
is
one
awesome
and
complex
brew
slightly
bitter
but
mostly
malty
the
feel
is
moderate
to
thin
but
smooth
and
wet
a
pint
is
not
enough
d
very
easy
to
drink
this
is
a
great
one
to
grab
if
youre
looking
to
drink
a
few
the
4
6
will
allow
you
to
kick
back
quite
a
few
with

buy
again
i
dont
mind
one
or
two
of
the
16
9
oz
bottles
but
thats
enough
for
me
i
could
sip
on
this
with
some
vanilla
ice
cream
though
or
heck
make
a
butterscotch
float
d
tasty
basic
sessionable
beer
definately
buy
more
drinkability
a
good
beer
in
the
style
english
bitter
d
as
are
most
of
the
style
this
is
a
great
drinking
beer
the
low
abv
is
a
plus
for
the
style
though
it
might
be
a
bit
sweet
for
some
i
found
this
enjoyable
and
would
love
to
find
a
sixer
of
this
for
a
chilly
night
with
friends
the
st
andrews
ale
pours
amber
with
some
copper
highlights
and
nice
crisp
claritythe
head
is
tan
and
creamy
it
looks
a
lot
like
the
frothing
on
a
lattebig

grainy
and
fresh
smellingwith
some
nice
baked

lots
of

a
dry
finish
lingers
and
is
also
creamy
and
softmedium
body
and
soft
carbonation
make
for
an
outstanding
ale
that
is
very
easy
to
enjoy
the

a
nice
caramellyfruity

juicy
with
toasted

earth
hint
of
spcies
it
has
great
sweetbitter
balance
with
plenty
of
both
its
zesty
and
lively
and
has
a
spiceyzesty
finish
with
just
a
lightly
dominant
bitterness
d
it
was
an
unremarkable
scottish
ale
with
so
many
better
in
this
style
i
would
not
seek
it
out
but
i
also
would
not
turn
it
away
drinkability
a
very
nice
well
balanced
ale
great
for
sessions
with
a
lower
abv
very
nice
very
drinkable
ale
goes
down
almost
too
easy
a
very
unique
ale
with
a
stiff
infusion
of
alcohol
drinkability
is
decent
this
brew
lacks
body
for
the
flavors
and
aromas
present
but
remains
well
proportioned
a
very
nice
scottish
ale
picked
it
up
at
total
wine
in
fort
myers
served
it
chilled
in
a
pub
glass
poured
a
ruby
red
grapefruit
color
with
a
decent
white
head
smell
was
like
a
fine
bourbon
caramel
toffee
marshmellow
with
some
floral
hops
in
the
balance
taste
was
heavenly
with
excellent
caramel
malt
overtones
followed
by
dry
fruits
and
a
creamy
floral
hop
finish
ach
thats
some
good
beer
outstanding
drinkability
this
is
up
there
with
fullers
esb
and
regular
belhaven
as
one
of
the
most
perfect
session
ales
you
could
ask
for
any
time
of
year
any
weather
give
me
sports
on
tv
and
a
sixer
of
this
and
id
be
perfectly
content
very
drinkable
next
time
im
going
to
have
to
buy
a
few
of
these
so
that
i
can
drink
more
overall
my
favorite
from
4
belhaven
offerings
i
drank
1
afternoon
excellent
session
beer
slightly
pricy
though
d
a
good
drinkable
example
of
the
style
lots
of
malt
character
not
overly
complex
but
pleasant
d
overall
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
though
i
wouldnt
rank
it
among
my
favorites
still
not
a
bad
beer
recommended
poured
into
my
mug
and
got
a
onefinger
frothy
head
that
quelled
somewhat
some
head
stayed
with
beer
left
a
few
lace
patches
to
complement
a
brownishauburn
body
that
is
somewhat
seethru
a
nice
spicy
smell
for
some
reason
not
much
malt
but
floral
hops
abound
and
i
picked
up
faint
notes
of
citrus
and
even
berries
i
also
picked
up
something
like
butterscotch
so
maybe
my
nose
is
out
of
whack
i
swear
theres
a
butteriness
in
the
smell
though
a
very
hoppy
ale
but
it
is
complemented
by
chocolate
and
toffee
malts
and
rounded
out
by
caramel
overall
a
wellbalanced
ale
that
goes
down
smooth
but
has
a
quasidry
backbite
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
is
not
going
to
be
very
soughtafter
but
for
how
cheap
it
is
and
for
how
good
it
is
and
the
fact
that
i
couldnt
keep
my
glass
down
this
is
a
musttry
and
a
session
beer
with
its
low
abv
do
you
think
this
beer
was
made
to
drink
while
watching
a
round
of
golf
im
not
sure
but
belhaven
hits
a
birdie
with
this
beer
i
tried
the
belhaven
line
on
the
recommendation
of
ba
member
jims145
and
will
try
others
by
this
brewer
pours
a
nice
amber
color
from
the
bottle
with
a
nice
white
head
that
has
some
lacing
to
it
it
has
an
aroma
of
sweet
malts
and
scotch
even
the
taste
is
the
same
it
tastes
awesome
really
it
has
a
sweet
malty
base
with
hints
of
scotch
that
i
really
enjoyed
the
taste
is
very
subtle
which
is
nice
and
it
is
a
really
good
scottish
ale
the
mouthfeel
is
very
good
and
it
is
pretty
drinkable
especially
if
you
like
scotch
not
quite
as
good
as
its
heavier
brethren
though
as
i
like
a
little
more
smoky
peatiness
that
the
wee
heavy
has
if
you
want
a
nice
session
scotch
ale
though
this
one
is
absolutely
awesome
drinkability
easy
to
drink
but
a
bit
lacking
in
the
flavor
department
interesting
pours
clear
with
a
deep
amber
color
there
is
a
lot
of
sediment
floating
around
minimal
head
with
some
lacing
sticking
to
the
side
of
the
glass
as
it
retreats
the
nose
is
slightly
sweet
the
flavor
is
outstanding
numerous
layers
on
top
of
each
other
revealing
themselves
over
time
it
starts
smooth
and
sweet
and
then
you
get
a
heartier
edge
it
never
deviates
from
its
path
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
sweet
and
the
drinkability
is
high
if
this
is
typical
of
scottish
ales
then
i
am
definitely
keen
to
taste
others
i
wouldnt
say
there
is
a
terrible
amount
of
stuff
going
on
with
this
beer
maybe
a
hint
of
caramel
some
hops
maybe
good
tasting
satisfying
but
nothing
to
go
crazy
about
medium
body
lowtomoderate
carbonation
overall
good
balance
i
would
call
this
a
good
basic
scottish
ale
pleasant
easy
to
drink
and
sessionable
the
home
of
golf
damn
straight
very
good
breweasy
to
drink
and
i
can
consume
this
all
nighthighly
enjoyable
and
recommended
this
is
a
great
scotish
ale
one
of
my
favorites
i
always
have
some
in
my
fridge
and
you
should
too
not
a
terrible
beer
but
not
terribly
interesting
and
too
sweet
and
heavy
for
more
than
one
bottle
i
doubt
ill
go
back
for
this
drinkability
very
nice
beer
but
not
an
everyday
sort
of
thing
in
my
opinion
its
a
nice
change
up
when
you
need
a
satisfyingly
simple
drink
perhaps
after
cooling
off
after
some
physical
activity
in
my
case
some
ultimate
frisbee
the
bottle
makes
it
seem
like
a
golf
beverage
i
wouldnt
disagree
appearance
is
a
murky
amber
brown
with
a
consistant
thin
head
that
leaves
a
nice
lace
aroma
has
roasted
malts
with
a
slight
butter
toffee
sweetness
taste
has
a
upfront
sweetness
with
light
toasted
malts
and
hops
and
a
creamy
medium
mouthfeel
a
good
bodied
ale
that
i
could
keep
drinking
a
good
one
to
try
oelergud
let
me
start
by
saying
that
i
have
a
bias
i
like
it
automatically
because
it
says
st
andrews
on
it
where
i
spent
several
months
in
college
that
said
i
do
really
enjoy
this
beer
a
very
solid
ale
with
the
quality
i
have
become
used
to
with
belhaven
it
looses
points
however
because
the
beer
is
completely
revealed
at
the
first
taste
many
of
the
best
beers
seem
to
give
increasingly
more
to
the
drinker
the
longer
the
liquid
is
held
in
the
mouth
like
a
hint
of
spice
citrus
or
what
have
you
this
beer
doesnt
really
so
it
wont
rank
as
one
of
the
elite
but
it
is
a
solid
choice
and
worth
drinking
if
you
have
the
chance
not
bad
lightly
flavored
but
quaffable
bitterstyle
ale
i
guess
im
just
becoming
a
jaded
american
i
just
couldnt
get
in
to
this
beer
the
taste
started
caramel
sweet
but
that
was
interrupted
by
a
pleasant
burst
of
herbal
hops
in
the
middle
the
hops
stayed
subtle
however
and
yielded
to
a
sweet
finish
silky
body
and
low
carbonation
made
this
one
go
down
easy
pours
a
very
clear
and
rather
bubbly
copper
the
halfinch
of
head
recedes
quickly
leaving
a
white
film
and
a
nice
smattering
of
lace
quite
malty
as
expected
for
the
style
biscuits
apricots
and
honey
with
faint
peaty
smokiness
and
earth
flavor
leans
heavily
towards
the
sweet
lovely
apricot
marmalade
and
honey
on
medium
toast
finishes
slightly
drier
and
herbal
excellent
moderate
body
is
creamy
and
strongly
carbonated
at
once
mellow
tasty
and
very
drinkable
overall
a
very
solid
outing
im
not
sure
id
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
it
but
its
a
nice
beer
overall
a
very
good
beer
not
really
your
typical
scottish
ale
more
of
a
bitter
in
my
view
recommended
this
is
a
great
scottish
ale
at
4
6
abv
its
perfectly
sessionable
recommended
halfliter
brown
bottle
with
no
freshness
date
it
pours
orangeycopper
with
three
fingers
of
fluffy
khaki
head
that
leaves
nice
lacing
nice
nuttyearthy
malt
aroma
at
first
but
soon
i
find
toasted
and
sweet
malts
and
notes
of
caramel
apple
the
flavor
is
also
quite
malty
with
notes
of
caramel
molasses
nutty
and
earthy
malts
with
gentle
hops
and
diacetyl
hiding
in
the
background
its
medium
body
is
fairly
smooth
drying
with
medium
carbonation
and
finish
overall
a
tasty
scottish
ale
but
it
would
be
even
better
if
more
robust
this
beer
pours
a
murky
dishwater
brown
with
a
beady
white
head
that
leaves
plenty
of
lacing
while
the
head
is
nice
the
body
of
this
beer
is
unattractive
smell
is
very
malty
lots
of
caramelized
notes
with
some
nice
spice
funky
herbal
hops
and
a
floral
heathery
note
very
nice
on
the
palate
sharp
hops
come
out
first
along
with
some
juicy
fruit
esters
and
light
sweet
caramel
notes
good
acidity
towards
the
end
pretty
unassuming
carbonation
that
lets
those
sharp
acidic
hops
dominate
overall
this
is
quite
good
excellent
session
beer
some
complexity
some
pleasing
flavors
and
some
characteristics
low
alcohol
good
acidity
slightly
sweet
malts
that
would
help
this
pair
with
a
multitude
of
simple
meals
pours
a
slightly
hazy
pale
amber
and
a
cream
colored
head
with
fair
retention
heavy
caramel
and
buttery
toffee

some
notes
prune
and
roasted

roasted

displaying
notes
of

toasted
brown
sugar
roasted
nuts
caramel
dates
and
a
bitter
hop
balance
with
herbal
notes
in
the
background
increasing
notes
of
toasted
grains
and
oaky
character
as
it
warms
medium
body
and
carbonation
leaves
a
descent
mouthfeel
the
finish
starts
a
tad
boozy
but
cleans
up
quickly
leaving
some
residual
nutty
caramel
notes
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
nice
copper
forming
a
thick
fluffy
1
inch
head
that
faded
very
slowly
leaving
medium
rings
of
lace
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
nice
caramel
notes
along
with
a
hint
of
nuts
the
taste
is
just
like
you
would
expect
from
belhaven
rich
creamy
malts
forming
a
delicious
nutty
flavor
along
with
a
slight
caramel
finish
medium
mouthfeel
that
finishes
smooth
overall
this
is
the
ideal
session
ale
imo
easy
to
drink
with
a
smooth
taste
definitely
try
this
poured
from
a
bottle
to
tumbler
at
45
degrees
i
guess
you
can
tell
i
liked
this
one
awsome
nice
redbrown
color
with
a
thick
fluffy
white
head
with
tiny
bubbles
linmped
together
like
a
nice
tasy
biscuit
flowert
biscuity
smell
with
great
lacing
taste
was
smooth
nice
nutty
caramel
taste
that
hung
on
your
tongue
and
made
you
want
to
take
big
hits
great
beer
i
want
a
case
a
very
simple
yet
elegant
no
fuss
scottish
ale
nonoffensive
a
great
drinker
sadly
the
bottle
wasnt
big
enough
a
fine
beer
when
bottled
a
great
beer
on
cask
pours
a
clear
mediumdeep
copper
lightening
toward
the
bottom
of
the
glass
loads
of
surfacing
carbonation
and
a
thick
and
creamy
onefinger
head
that
is
retained
very
well
taking
on
a
billowy
texturing
smell
is
overwhelmingly
maltdominated
caramel
and
butter
woody
notes
some
fruitiness
and
a
touch
of
spicy
hops
barely
noticeable
linger
deep
in
the
background
taste
is
better
balanced
and
not
so
sweet
still
plenty
of
caramel
but
with
a
peaty
sort
of
smoke
permeating
it
and
taming
the
sugary
character
diacetyl
to
be
sure
but
in
an
understated
sort
of
way
and
mild
spicy
hops
throughout
mouthfeel
is
crisp
but
fullbodied
and
conducive
to
a
lingering
aftertaste
and
drinkability
is
very
good
a
pleasant
scottish
ale
very
enjoyable
this
is
the
kind
of
beer
i
really
like
very
distinct
tastes
yet
smooth
low
carboration
and
distinct
bitterness
makes
this
one
the
kind
of
beer
you
that
works
especially
well
after
a
couple
of
pints
or
at
the
end
of
a
night
out
a
nice
tasty
scottish
session
brew
a
nice
balance
between
sweet
malt
and
earthy
bitter
hops
d
excellent
this
is
deep
and
complex
enough
to
keep
me
interested
buit
balanced
and
restrained
enough
to
not
overpower
the
senses
while
i
wouldnt
consider
this
a
session
brew
a
bit
rich
for
that
it
is
still
very
drinkable
drinkability
i
love
malty
brews
like
but
i
could
see
the
apparent
heaviness
getting
to
you
after
awhile
still
if
you
like
the
style
great
brew
this
was
a
very
nice
beer
had
a
nice
cirspness
and
was
easy
to
drink
had
an
excellent
smell
with
some
apple
phenol
in
it
it
also
had
nice
head
and
retention
the
taste
was
very
smooth
and
fully
bodied
and
had
a
nice
caramel
malt
profile
a
beer
to
drink
at
any
time
of
year
it
was
alot
better
than
bellhaven
scottish
ale
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
excellent
representation
of
its
style
pours
to
about
an
iced
tea
color
with
a
creamy
head
and
thick
clingy
lacing
head
retains
very
well
smells
like
opening
up
a
box
of
buttery
shortbread
cookies
intensely
malty
faint
smoke
in
the
background
taste
is
very
malty
with
a
bit
of
a
dried
fruit
character
the
shortbread
seems
to
not
be
as
pronounced
in
the
flavor
on
the
other
had
the
smoke
seems
to
be
more
forward
slight
tartness
in
the
finish
soft
carbonation
with
a
light
to
moderate
body
not
as
full
as
id
like
but
this
is
still
quite
nice
this
is
definately
a
quaffer
that
also
offers
a
lot
of
flavor
try
a
chaser
with
this
highland
park
or
oban
md
a
little
too
acrid
at
first
but
an
overall
nice
beer
would
make
a
great
session
beer
damn
near
a
perfect
pour
head
was
around
an
inch
thick
body
is
a
crips
golden
bronze
color
that
kind
of
surprised
me
i
was
expecting
something
darker
and
leaning
more
towards
amber
nose
is
very
yeasty
like
the
smell
of
a
brewpub
i
also
smell
some
caramel
a
sip
reveals
more
caramel
a
bit
of
butter
and
some
slightly
burnt
sugar
theres
a
smatter
of
hops
in
the
finish
mouth
is
medium
and
smooth
wow
i
could
definitely
session
this
with
pleasure
served
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
copper
color
with
a
small
lingering
offwhite
head
it
smells
like
malt
and
caramel
not
much
else
it
tastes
the
same
way
with
a
little
smoky
flavor
too
the
taste
is
also
sweet
and
bitter
at
the
same
time
the
beer
has
a
medium
mouthfeel
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
body
of
the
beer
is
medium
and
it
goes
down
pretty
easy
its
also
a
bit
slick
on
the
tongue
its
not
an
overpowering
beer
at
all
but
it
could
become
a
session
beer
for
me
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
id
drink
this
again
this
ones
for
those
out
there
who
like
a
trip
to
the
fringes
of
flavour
country
every
once
in
a
while
an
easy
drinker
that
still
gives
your
palate
something
to
think
about
good
to
see
this
back
again
this
is
a
beer
with
nice
flavours
that
doesnt
require
too
much
attention
a
good

for
sitting
and
chatting
with
friends
st
andrews
is
a
deep
and
shadowy
copper
color
the
head
is
tan
unassuming
and
unremarkable
nice
aroma
very
lightly
roasted
malt
caramel
a
bit
of
fruit
not
much
in
the
way
of
hops
in
the
smell
but
theres
just
a
fleeting
hint
of
smokiness
the
taste
is
earthy
and
malty
with
less
sweetness
than
the
aroma
would
indicate
the
brew
has
straightforward
and
uncomplicated
flavors
with
a
lightly
bitter
finish
lightboarding
on
medium
mouthfeel
i
thought
that
it
could
have
been
a
little
sweeter
its
uncomplicated
nicely
drinkable
and
clean

this
is
a
tasty
low
alcohol
choice
ive
found
scottish
ales
in
general
to
be
a
quality
beer
style
when
done
right
look
no
further
than
st
andrews
as
an
excellent
example
and
one
to
set
the
bar
pours
a
light
orange
color
with
a
small
head
smells
of
malt
with
the
possiblity
of
some
peated
malt
taste
has
a
smokey
peaty
taste
along
with
some
sweet
malt
backbone
hops
dont
really
play
a
roll
in
the
flavor
good
mouthfeel
if
you
like
peated
malt
youll
like
this
taste
more
caramel
in
the
malt
with
high
carbonation
and
a
touch
of
peat
smoke
dry
but
fairly
thick
finish
with
a
husky
note
mild
leafy
hops
round
out
a
decidedly
acrossthepond
brew
pours
a
clear
dark
copper
under
a
one
finger
offwhite
head
that
lingers
well
despite
lots
of
large
bubbles
leaving
a
few
dots
of
lace
interesting
seemingly
cherry
nose
with
malt
backing
the
mouth
is
light
and
wellcarbonated
theres
a
very
rich
complex
and
interesting
taste
here
grape
and
strawberry
accent
the
bready
malt
in
the
opening
followed
by
the
very
clear
and
unmistakable
peat
moss
flavor
so
noticeable
in
several
single
malt
scotches
theres
not
much
hops
here
but
the
peat
provides
a
good
dry
background
lingering
well
into
the
aftertaste
as
it
warms
sweet
sugary
cherry
emerges
ever
stronger
this
is
a
very
unusual
very
enjoyable
brew
drinkability
while
the
first
few
sips
are
very
complex
and
keep
me
interested
the
cumulative
effect
of
all
the
fruit
is
actually
kind
of
metallic
by
the
bottom
of
the
glass
its
coming
off
more
as
orange
crush
than
anything
next
d
if
this
is
a
good
indication
of
scottish
ales
then
i
think
ive
found
another
style
im
fond
of
this
is
a
refreshing
beer
that
goes
down
easy
and
keeps
me
wanting
more
unfortunately
i
cant
find
the
belhaven
st
andrews
locally
i
picked
this
up
while
on
a
business
trip
in
texas
highly
recommended
if
you
want
a
pleasing
introduction
to
scottish
ales
taste
the
peat
flavors
really
stand
out
on
the
initial
sips
the
sweet
caramel
malts
come
out
next
followed
by
that
smokiness
theres
no
real
hop
presence
but
none
was
really
expected
from
this
style
with
the
peat
and
smokey
flavors
this
has
a
more
unique
flavor
than
i
expected
mouthfeel
is
on
the
thin
side
with
very
low
carbonation
and
is
kind
of
disapointing
mouthfeeldrinkability
nicely
carbonated
with
tiny
bubbles
that
actively
showcase
the
spicy
smoky
malty
aspects
of
the
beer
the
creamy
weight
in
the
mouth
is
substantial
yet
effortless
as
this
drinks
beautifully
very
highly
recommended
wow
so
often
i
only
think
of
scottish
ales
as
the
schilling
variety
and
the
wee
heavys
but
this
is
something
else
a
little
almost
mild
ale
of
near
amber
golden
color
with
a
chunky
head
smells
of
smokey
peated
scotch
with
a
gentle
under
current
of
sweet
malt
tastes
of
long
boil
caramelization
with
a
nice
upfront
but
not
overpoaering
smokeyness
that
could
come
from
the
way
the
malt
is
kilned
the
more
i
drank
the
better
this
beer
got
and
it
was
nice
and
light
which
kept
the
smokeyness
from
holding
to
the
palate
to
hard
i
would
have
few
in
a
night
but
for
sure
this
is
a
nice
thing
to
throw
in
the
rotation
of
any
beer
session
taste
was
very
malty
with
a
nice
mellow
finish
maybe
abit
smokey
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
slick
on
the
tounge
smooth
and
crisp
very
enjoyable
a
solid
scotch
ale
but
i
think
one
will
do
me
just
fine
ontap
at
castle
on
king
in
kitchener
on
clear
amber
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
some
lacing
was
evident
and
this
lasted
for
some
time
peat
smoke
aroma
with
a
medicinal
character
like
an
islay
scotch
coupled
with
mild
fruit
and
malt
mild
balanced
flavour
with
an
emphasis
on
malt
but
hop
bitterness
definitely
kept
this
in
check
fruity
esters
rounded
the
flavour
out
too
mellow
smokiness
lingered
in
the
dry
finish
quite
a
good
beer
with
enough
complexity
too
keep
it
interesting
throughout
a
pint
or
two
this
is
an
excellent
scottish
ale
its
slightly
less
smokey
than
belhaven
wee
heavy
but
just
as
complex
this
was
actually
the
first
scotch
ale
i
tried
when
i
was
in
university
i
thought
it
was
so
exotic
back
then
it
still
rocks
an
average
beer
i
was
expecting
more
from
the
birthplace
of
golf
but
i
guess
if
you
master
golf
you
cant
master
beers
too
or
can
you
d
very
drinkable
excellent
session
beer
the
beer
pours
a
nice
amber
with
a
wonderful
bit
of
sediment
suspended
and
a
good
white
head
it
has
a
good
aroma
of
malt
and
dark
fruit
with
a
whif
of
alcohol
this
has
a
fine
malt
taste
this
is
a
more
refined
taste
than
say
the
wee
heavy
a
very
nice
medium
body
with
an
oily
finish
i
was
quite
impressed
with
this
and
will
find
more
of
it
in
my
refrigerator
poured
a
light
copper
color
with
white
moderate
head
tghat
proved
to
be
longlasting
leaving
noce
lacing
on
the
glass
smell
is
toasty
and
sweet
notes
of
caramel
also
present
taste
is
sweet
and
malty
can
also
taste
caramel
and
some
smokiness
some
fruitiness
also
present
and
gibes
a
nice
wellrounded
taste
sensation
finishes
malty
but
there
is
also
some
hop
dryness
there
that
complimetns
with
malts
well
a
very
nice
beer
thast
combines
malt
and
hops
in
an
extraordinary
manner
very
easy
to
drink
and
very
refreshing
nicely
drinkable
drinkability
this
is
an
excellent
tasting
beer
one
of
the
best
looking
beers
i
have
ever
seen
in
my
life
the
combination
of
flavors
is
unique
and
delicious
very
nice
pours
a
dirty
yeasty
pint
with
small
head
and
light
lace
aroma
is
yeasty
and
malty
with
a
slight
british
hop
flavor
is
dominated
by
the
british
hop
flavors
and
a
sweet
malty
aftertaste
to
wash
it
down
body
is
thin
for
this
small
beer
but
very
refreshing
a
delicious
and
very
drinkable
british
session
beer
for
one
of
my
favorite
scottish
brewerys
i
must
admit
given
my
predisposition
to
this
genre
that
i
was
a
wee
bit
bad
joke
disappointed
it
didnt
have
the
range
or
body
of
other
ales
i
have
had
id
certainly
drink
one
again
if
given
the
chance
but
i
would
buy
something
else
over
this
either
to
try
or
reenjoy
pours
a
nice
copper
brown
with
a
tannish
head
that
soon
retreats
to
leave
a
nice
lacing
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
very
smooth
a
fair
example
of
the
style
good
malty
aroma
the
increases
considerably
as
the
beer
warms
fairly
mellow
maltiness
i
believe
it
could
stand
a
bit
more
for
better
balance
but
all
in
all
not
a
bad
drop
at
all
notes
pretty
good
scotch
ale
good
malt
sweetness
overall
has
a
good
balance
but
it
just
leaves
you
wanting
something
more
drinkability

this
is
a
nice
ale
that
went
down
well
the
beer
dispenses
the
500ml
brown
bottle
a
clear
deep
brown
with
a
modest
sized
semicreamy
light
tan
head
that
dissolves
rather
quickly
leaving
a
fine
coating
of
lace
upon
the
glass
nose
is
sweet
malt
with
light
hints
of
peat
fresh
and
delightful
to
the
senses
start
is
somewhat
sweet
with
a
light
malt
presence
and
a
fair
to
middling
top
finish
is
pleasantly
acidic
and
the
hops
delicate
in
their
spiciness
quite
dry
and
somewhat
tart
aftertaste
a
nice
session
beer
in
my
humble
opinion
overall
a
good
drink
but
it
leaves
a
bit
to
be
desired
compared
to
some
of
their
other
brews
one
of
the
better
scottish
ales
i
have
enjoyed
very
nice
appearance
with
the
light
amber
color
and
an
off
white
head
the
head
started
out
quite
pillowy
later
layed
down
to
a
laceing
smell
was
of
a
nutty
origin
with
a
malty
backbone
not
much
in
the
hops
area
in
this
one
it
seemed
like
it
was
going
to
be
a
lighter
tasteing
brew
but
ended
up
being
good
and
malty
very
clean
taste
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
definately
one
of
the
better
scottish
ales
in
my
eyes
st
andrews
is
copper
in
color
with
a
short
head
aroma
isnt
very
strong
light
malts
a
little
buttery
smell
and
some
hops
taste
is
different
from
anything
ive
had
before
there
are
notable
tastes
of
mild
nuttiness
with
some
smokiness
thrown
in
hops
have
an
herbal
quality
plus
there
is
some
lingering
sweetness
in
the
finish
complex
but
a
little
odd
to
me
at
first
this
beer
was
a
little
offputting
for
me
but
ive
warmed
up
to
it
after
half
the
bottle
admittedly
scottish
ale
isnt
a
style
i
have
a
lot
of
expirience
with
i
like
this
more
interesting
than
the
other
belhaven
beers
ive
had
but
still
not
the
one
i
prefer
overall
named
after
the
patron
saint
of
scotland
and
the
unofficial
home
of
golf
this
is
a
lovely
creation
had
it
on
cask
many
times
but
this
was
the
first
time
from
the
bottle
it
did
not
disappoint
well
worth
trying
i
have
a
hard
time
finding
exactly
what
i
dont
like
about
this
beer
but
i
find
it
the
least
interesting
of
the
beers
sold
by
belhaven
in
the
us
not
very
complex
but
a
solid
and
very
drinkable
scotch
ale
not
much
of
a
malt
profile
for
a
scottish
ale
but
very
likeable
very
interesting
not
a
summer
backyard
beer
not
a
thirst
quencher
not
impressed
500
ml
bottle
now
available
in
norway
colour
is
yellowish
brown
good
thick
head
aroma
has
first
some
fruity
hops
then
dusty
malts
flavour
is
malty
with
hints
of
caramel
and
dust
there
is
too
much
carbonation
for
my
taste
okish
beer
but
not
remarkable
the
first
putt
is
a
wellstruck
25
foot
doublebreaker
that
takes
a
peek
at
the
cup
before
stopping
6
inches
past
for
an
easy
tapin
par
long
and
not
quite
lingering
the
finish
allows
the
sweetish
flavorful
malt
to
make
something
of
a
comeback
and
leave
one
with
memories
of
a
wellcrafted
scottish
ale
this
is
one
of
the
lighter
and
less
malty
of
the
belhavens
i
have
tried
the
hops
really
come
through
on
the
finish
and
i
would
be
hard
pressed
to
name
this
as
a
scottish
ale
in
a
blind
taste
test
i
detect
south
of
the
border
pale
ale
tendencies
in
the
profile
this
is
a
full
bodied
beer
that
belies
its
low
alcohol
after
a
round
of
golf
this
would
hit
the
proverbial
spot
the
head
is
lasting
and
nicely
refined
on
a
dark
orange
purple
color
body
the
smell
is
malty
with
caramel
notes
and
grassy
but
disappointing
too
weak
the
taste
shows
a
nice
malty
character
with
caramel
and
enjoyable
notes
of
chocolate
quite
earthy
too
the
thickness
of
the
hops
combined
with
some
dark
chocolate
bitterness
circles
the
mouth
but
not
aggressively
the
mouthfeel
gets
better
as
the
brew
warms
a
warming
chocolate
aspect
with
hints
of
coffee
enjoyable
but
not
exceptional
this
clear
dark
redamber
beer
sports
an
inch
and
a
half
of
almost
white
meringue
head
long
thin
arcs
of
lacing
nose
is
a
little
fishy
and
tangy
front
is
smoky
peaty
tangy
middle
brings
up
some
caramel
malt
its
thick
and
sweet
with
some
butter
the
peaty
tanginess
or
is
it
tangy
peatiness
gets
an
encore
in
the
sourish
almost
astringent
finish
interesting
tasty
i
like
it
not
a
bad
drop
intresting
nonetheless
very
drinkable
nice
beer
belhavens
st
andrews
is
one
such
ale
it
is
essentially
a
pale
ale
and
features
a
crisp
bitter
aroma
with
lagerlike
properties
a
clear
copper
color
and
a
tall
head
of
eggshell
white
froth
the
body
has
gentle
contours
nice
balance
and
the
finish
is
classically
bitter
st
andrews
is
remarkably
easy
to
drink
it
has
superb
lace
and
an
abundance
of
character
everything
about
this
ale
is
suggestive
of
sustained
reacquaintances
poured
this
beer
from
a
nice
looking
bottle
amber
colored
liquid
with
a
light
brown
head
smell
is
sweet
malt
with
a
hint
of
hops
the
taste
makes
this
one
a
winner
its
caramel
sweet
malt
is
accompanied
by
roasted
graininess
the
hop
aroma
really
boosts
the
flavor
in
my
opinion
this
reminds
me
of
boston
lager
in
a
way
but
with
a
more
mellow
and
refined
slightly
sweet
taste
it
might
be
dry
hopped
i
dont
know
but
it
is
very
refreshing
and
tasty
well
not
a
great
beer
in
my
opinion
just
didnt
seem
right
and
far
too
bitter
for
a
scottish
ale
especially
one
thats
not
a
wee
heavy
i
gave
it
a
try
because
i
like
golf
though
ill
never
have
the
singledigit
handicap
to
actually
play
st
andrews
but
just
dont
think
id
have
this
one
again
beer
is
good
happy
beering
light
aroma
a
little
roasted
barley
and
some
caramel
foamy
yellowish
tan
head
with
a
bunch
of
pock
marks
that
holds
up
pretty
well
and
looks
like
it
wants
to
cling
to
the
glass
i
need
to
rinse
better
transparent
golden
amber
color
very
fine
bubbles
floating
to
the
top
light
clean
beer
easy
drinking
something
in
it
reminds
me
of
a
good
lager
the
flavor
is
pale
a
bit
of
caramel
finishes
with
a
pinch
of
sweet
hops
thanks
to
my
brother
for
giving
me
a
few
from
his
beers
of
the
month
6er
amber
body
with
a
tan
head
that
has
good
retention
and
sticks
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
nicely
smell
is
of
dark
malts
and
burn
caramel
with
a
strong
leafy
aroma
fruit
is
also
detected
in
the
smell
along
with
a
pungent
smokiness
that
can
not
be
missed
taste
is
of
grains
caramel
malt
with
dark
roasted
notes
throughout
a
hearty
earthy
flavor
as
well
which
i
do
not
particularly
care
for
sight
buttery
aftertaste
light
carbonation
smooth
and
easytodrink
with
the
low
abv
however
this
brew
is
noticeably
thin
mouthfeel
wise
very
drinkable
yes
i
will
have
another
one
of
these
i
was
not
very
impressed
with
this
rather
onedimensional
pale
ale
it
poured
nicely
enoughthough
a
bit
mustyand
the
white
fluffy
head
was
inviting
the
aroma
was
tart
and
lemony
but
clearly
lurking
in
there
was
the
smokiness
i
have
come
to
anticipate
from
the
scots
well
that
smoked
peat
flavor
came
through
in
the
taste
overwhelming
just
about
everything
else
but
the
lemons
and
i
did
not
find
the
combination
all
that
compatible
or
complementary
the
more
the
ale
lingered
in
my
taste
buds
the
stronger
the
peat
also
it
was
very
thin
the
beer
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
thin
white
head
that
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
sweet
malts
and
scottish
ale
yeast
the
taste
is
decent
it
has
a
malty
core
of
a
single
malt
ale
but
it
has
a
smokey
finish
it
tastes
like
wood
chips
or
something
anyway
im
not
sure
its
a
good
taste
but
its
certainly
different
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
its
a
low
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
beer
drinks
fair
the
woody
flavor
gets
annoying
quick
its
one
and
done
for
me
e
for
effort
this
beer
poured
out
a
beautifully
looking
light
amber
color
with
a
very
rocky
and
creamy
head
of
foam
looks
delicious
the
aroma
is
laced
with
caramel
and
smoky
malt
sweetness
and
behind
that
is
lurking
an
earthy
and
pungent
hoppiness
smokey
and
grainy
tang
in
the
taste
that
finishes
clean
a
light
and
very
drinkable
ale
the
body
has
some
malt
but
is
light
overall
not
overly
sweet
by
all
means
a
nice
tasting
and
flavorful
beer
hohum
pale
amber
color
with
a
decent
cream
colored

earthy
notes
abound
in
this
light
ale
peaty
and
lightly
hopped
decent
malt
texture
with
some
tartlike
malt
acidity
in
the
finish
once
again
earthy
foamy
creamy
and
smooth
in
the
mouthfeel
florally
hopped
in
the
finish
drinkability
is
high
for
a
malty
scottish
ale
id
like
to
try
this
one
again
had
this
one
in
a
22oz
bottle
pours
a
light
amber
color
with
a
thin
head
that
dies
off
quickly
the
aroma
is
boring
as
there
is
a
little
hopiness
and
a
little
malt
but
not
much
else
the
first
taste
is
bitter
with
a
hint
of
smokiness
to
it
and
there
are
some
malts
that
are
evident
as
well
there
were
also
some
caramel
hints
in
there
it
tastes
too
watered
down
the
finish
is
fairly
dry
this
is
alright
for
a
scottish
ale
but
its
not
strong
enough
a
very
easy
drinker
and
the
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
and
easy
it
is
medium
bodied
overall
a
simple
yet
stable
ale
this
one
would
go
well
with
a
meal
didnt
like
this
beer
that
much
dont
know
if
it
was
a
bad
bottle
or
old
bottle
or
what
could
be
it
was
just
a
bad
beer
medium
brown
color
small
head
malty

smoky
not
very
hoppy
lighter

mild
taste
and
flavor
mouthfeel

aftertaste
is
slightly
malty
this
beer
poured
a
cloudy
brown
with
a
rich
robust
white
head
the
aroma
was
muted
but
of
malt
the
taste
of
the
malty
sweetness
was
the
crowning
achievement
of
this
beer
the
sweet
stayed
on
the
tongue
long
after
the
liquid
was
swallowed
the
hops
were
not
present
in
either
the
nose
or
the
tongue
the
mouthfeel
was
somewhat
creamy
and
almost
medium
i
found
this
beer
very
drinkable
and
liked
the
strong
malt
presence
pours
a
copper
kacki
color
with
a
nice
thick
cream
colored
head
with
holes
on
top
aromas
off
the
nose
of
caramel
malt
bread
some
floural
and
peat
with
hints
of
hops
medium
carbonation
seems
to
make
the
malt
caramel
and
slight
honey
come
together
with
a
hint
of
smoke
like
a
grilled
steak
finishes
with
a
roasted
malthop
bitterness
that
goes
down
easy
great
everyday
session
beer
i
could
drink
the
st
andrews
or
the
scottish
ale
anyday
of
the
week
and
twice
on
sunday
belhaven
st

wow
ive
passed
this
beer
a
couple
of
times
and
took
no
notice
of
it
but
man
i
made
a
big
mistake
wonderful
smokypeaty
malts
balanced
by
an
undercurrent
of
hops
longish
aftertaste
like
a
nice
scotch
whiskey
which
should
come
as
no
surprise
given
its
country
of
origin
extremely
smooth
almost
silky
mouthfeel
extremely
drinkable
this
is
an
very
flavorful
relatively
complex
brew
im
convinced
that
anyone
who
likes
flavorful
beers
would
find
this
to
be
a
tremendous
session
brew
well
worth
searching
it
out
enjoy
fruity
sweet
smell
with
a
subtle
floral
character
very
aromatic
and
quite
complex
copper
orange
in
color
with
an
offwhite
head
very
full
flavored
and
well
balanced
i
was
able
to
get
some
nuts
and
very
low
levels
of
diacetyl
drying
bitterness
came
through
on
the
finish
quite
nice
color
is
a
pale
amber
color
that
has
some
gritty
thickness
to
it
and
pours
with
a
very
nice
fluffy
tannish
head
thats
about
two
fingers
high
and
had
great
staying
power
the
lace
placed
huge
sheets
along
the
glass
smells
of
sweet
malt
caramel
thats
sorta
earthy
and
has
what
i
think
is
a
clear
bright
hop
note
in
the
back
taste
is
great
super
clean
and
smooth
with
nice
caramel
malt
thats
sweetly
bittering
and
toasted
with
nice
honey
and
slightly
herbal
hops
balanced
in
that
give
it
a
very
nice
complexity
and
super
full
and
smooth
character
this
is
one
spectactular
scottich
ale
one
of
my
favs
from
belhaven
along
with
the
wee
heavy
and
give
to
you
a
strong
recommendation
on
picking
some
up
great
bottle
and
label
that
took
me
back
to
the
great
buildings
standing
guard
at
the
shoreline
of
st
andrews
and
the
winds
flowing
in
from
the
north
sea
wish
id
had
one
these
on
my
first
visit
to
the
famous
birthplace
of
golf
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
more
than
i
like
most
of
my
golf
scores
st
andrews
ale
the
beer
from
the
home
of
golf
it
has
a
wonderful
appearance
slightly
cloudy
with
sediment
noticeable
chunks
floating
about
this
amberburnt
orange
hued
brew
a
large
anf
fluffy
head
of
bright
whiteness
greets
you
i
notice
some
honeyish
flavor
on
first
sip
its
a
pleasing
flavor
along
with
the
caramel
malty
sweetness
some
hop
character
is
present
throughout
this
beer
is
awesome
i
really
enjoy
the
dry
and
crisp
hoppy
finish
too
definitely
recommended
pours
a
bright
reddish
amber
color
with
a
foamy
white
head
that
fades
into
a
fizzy
lace
nose
is
dominated
by
caramel
with
a
strong
peaty
undertone
medium
in
body
and
quite
smooth
taste
is
earthy
with
notes
of
smoked
peat
followed
by
some
herbal
notes
and
a
touch
of
malt
sweetness
in
the
finish
a
nice
scottish
ale
but
nothing
special
scotlands

nose
upon
the

smell
after
smelling
for
a
bit
could
detect
a
bit
of
smoke
and
malt
can
drink
plenty
of
this
fine
ale
clear
dark
copper

head
is
gone

fast

just

left

in

to
the

is
very
nice

first
impression
is
mildly
fruity
some
sweet
apple
combined
with
dark
brown
sugar
and
a
floral
sense
overall
flattens
as
the
hops
balance
and
finishes
with
the
slightest
astringency
not
big
and
sticky
this
ale
is
an
easygoing
drinker
an
awesome
well
rounded
beer
from
belhaven
this
beer
has
it
a
from
its
beautiful
copper
amber
color
with
great
head
retention
to
the
final
drop
you
wont
be
disatisfied
a
full
body
beer
with
a
great
balance
of
malt
and
hops
ok
this
is
much
better
than
the
belhaven
scottish
ale
this
one
picks
up
where
the
creamy
ale
leaves
off
by
adding
color
and
hops
there
is
still
the
creamy
texture
but
the
hops
cuts
that
so
the
mouthfeel
is
not
as
silky
but
the
added
hops
allows
you
to
taste
this
beer
it
is
far
more
enjoyable
in
bouquet
and
taste
and
texture
i
highly
recommend
this
one
actually
i
may
have
gotten
an
old
6pack
since
this
was
hidden
away
on
a
dusty
shelf
in
a
wine
shop
that
does
very
little
to
sell
their
beer
maybe
a
fresher
bottle
would
change
my
opionion
another
nice
beer
from
belhaven
a
bit
lighter
in
color
than
the
average
scottish
offering
it
was
a
medium
copper
head
was
tan
and
persistent
lacing
was
similar
to
this
breweries
wee
heavy
it
was
prominent
from
mid
glass
on
down
i
detected
some
roasted
nuttiness
which
was
very
tasty
a
solid
winter
beer
i
enjoyed
this
with
a
philly
cheese
steak
sandwich
on
a
cold
gray
day
another
top
notch
brew
from
belhaven
this
is
every
bit
as
good
as
their
regular
scottish
ale
this
is
a
nuttier
dryer
and
maybe
milder
beer
amber
with
persistent
head
lots
of
grassy
aromas
and
flavors
some
traces
of
smoke
as
you
dig
further
in
and
upfront
big
nutty
brown
ale
flavors
not
especially
bitter
and
a
wet
finish
perhaps
a
spikier
hop
element
would
work
here
but
then
again
it
is
a
pretty
complex
beer
and
each
sip
gives
me
a
different
impression
a
step
away
from
scottish
ale
into
the
brown
ale
direction
but
still
plenty
of
grassy
and
smoky
flavors
coldcut
sandwich
pairing
suggestion
is
deadon
i
imagine
a
lot
of
golf
players
drink
bud
or
coors
light
after
a
game
which
is
downright
insulting
when
a
beer
like
this
is
available
wow
really
liked
the
earthy
undertones
to
this
beer
i
love
to
drink
a
good
scottish
ale
like
this
when
nice
and
cold
outside
had
some
nutty
qualities
to
it
really
liked
this
beer
and
will
get
it
again
i
liked
this
better
than
by
drinking
companion
bigemail
the
appearance
was
amber
with
a
shortlived
head
that
left
excellent
lacing
as
with
bige
the
aroma
and
flavor
to
me
were
both
malt
i
did
not
notice
the
nut
flavors
or
mustiness
that
others
have
but
i
will
revisit
this
to
try
to
discover
some
of
the
nuances
a
highly
drinkable
beer
the
label
says
the
home
of
golf
i
love
it
that
is
a
genius
way
to
win
beer
converts
imo
pours
a
tea
color
with
a
very
small
head
the
smell
is
great
with
notes
of
roasted
caramel
sweetness
the
taste
is
a
malted
roast
with
an
aftertaste
of
musty
socks
taste
almost
nothing
like
the
smell
has
you
thinking
it
will
kind
of
like
talking
to
someone
on
the
phone
and
then
meeting
them
later
they
never
look
like
what
you
thought
this
a
lightbodied
beer
kind
of
watery
after
smelling
with
high
expectations
i
was
actually
disappointed
in
this
one
sorry
to
be
the
wrench
in
the
gears
cheers
i
would
certainly
buy
this
beer
again
hazy
light
brown
in
color
with
a
fairly
thin
head
the
aroma
is
quite
appertizing
and
is
comprised
of
nutty
bready
and
sweet
crystal
malt
notes
theres
just
a
hint
of
earthy
hop
nose
but
i
wouldnt
of
noticed
it
if
i
werent
looking
for
it
the
carbonation
is
perfect
being
low
enough
to
provide
for
a
smooth
mouthfeel
but
high
enough
to
help
carry
the
malt
flavors
caramelized
wort
flavors
from
perhaps
an
extended
boil
are
accompanied
by
delicious
nutty
malt
notes
and
barely
balancing
hop
foundation
st
andrews
finishes
w
a
slight
roasted
malt
bitterness
wow
for
a
beer
this
light
it
is
highly
flavorful
an
absolutely
ideal
session
beer
notes
well
balanced
and
quite
drinkable
does
not
rock
the
boat
yet
play
well
with
mixing
malt
and
hop
flavours
this
would
pair
well
with
a
smoked
turkey
sandwich
on
sourdough
bread
another
belhaven
classic
and
like
the
scottish
classics
its
often
imitated
but
never
equaled
malty
sweet
without
being
overtly
so
with
the
perfect
hop
balance
just
a
touch
of
alcohol
warms
the
back
of
the
throat
a
true
pleasure
to
drink
rich
and
malty
giving
way
to
a
pleasant
tartness
hops
tended
to
be
more
acidic
than
bitter
a
good
choice
with
a
coldcut
sandwich
excellent
scottish
ale
very
sweet
and
smooth
an
impressive
really
nicely
done
and
remarkably
drinkable
scottish
ale
that
satisfies
from
first
to
last
absolutely
worth
trying
cheers
its
on
the
light
side
of
mediumbodied
pretty
smooth
and
crisp
most
of
the
way
easing
out
of
it
a
little
later
in
the
sip
overall
the
mouthfeel
of
this
brew
in
conjunction
with
its
moderately
sweet
but
rather
malty
flavor
really
make
this
brew
a
nice
drinker
a
very
interesting
scotch
ale
that
tastes
much
bigger
then
it
should
at
least
in
terms
of
its
abv
a
rather
nice
brew
overall
this
was
given
to
me
from
the
can
so
i
cant
describe
the
appearance
however
the
aromas
and
flavors
were
typical
of
a
scottish
ale
sweet
malts
toffee
nuts
its
a
little
lighter
than
say
dirty
bastard
or
old
chub
but
the
flavors
come
together
nicely
and
id
consider
this
a
good
sessionabledrinkable
scottish
ale
better
than
the
babbling
blonde
i
had
previously
equally
tasty
but
a
little
on
the
flat
side
malty
sweetness
with
a
good
bit
of
toffee
and
dark
fruits
perhaps
a
tad
too
sweet
for
me
anyway
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
solid
beer
price
is
good
and
the
beer
is
tasty
i
think
most
anyone
would
could
like
this
especially
nonbeer
lovers
at
5
1
abv
i
would
say
pretty
sessionable
i
would
have
no
problem
drinking
this
again
what
a
wonderful
beer
if
so
hard
to
find
a
good
scottish
ale
their
to
heavy
or
too
much
alc
this
one
taste
great
looks
great
this
one
has
moree
then
a
hint
of
choclate
sosit
back
and
enjoy
a
great
tasting
beer
that
you
will
be
telling
other
in
the
morning
enjoy
overall
i
really
like
and
had
it
before
but
this
is
the
first
time
its
not
very
carbonated
flavors
are
not
off
and
drinks
great
so
it
didnt
influence
much
great
brew
from
a
local
craft
brewery
overall
a
very
solid
very
drinkable
lighter
scottish
style
ale
not
savory
enough
due
to
the
slight
watery
taste
had
a
lot
going
for
it
at
first
then
it
died
off
into
mellow
land
take
it
or
leave
it
either
way
overall
pretty
simple
basic
and
easy
drinking
about
the
mildest
lightest
scotch
ales
out
there
nothing
special
would
be
a
nice
starter
beer
for
scotch
ales
overall
i
drank
a
six
pack
of
this
like
nobodys
business
lighter
bodied
for
a
scotch
ale
but
with
good
malt
flavor
to
revert
to
the
traditional
antique
schilling
scale
consider
this
a
60
schilling
which
would
indicate
a
scottish
ale
of
lighter
body
and
strength
the
maxwells
scottish
ale
is
a
great
lighter
style
scotch
ale
gives
those
who
are
afraid
of
the
dark
and
good
intro
to
malty
awesomeness
this
beer
poured
a
dark
amber
without
much
head
or
lace
the
smell
and
taste
was
bolster
by
a
malt
with
slight
roast
goddness
the
body
was
light
and
had
smooth
carboantion
overall
its
a
decent
lighter
dark
beercall
it
mild
dark
overall
not
real
familiar
with
scottish
ales
dont
really
dig
the
style
but
i
can
pick
up
the
quality
in
the
beer
i
think
its
better
than
ok
could
use
a
bigger
mouthfeel
it
has
a
nice
aroma
and
decent
flavor
its
worth
a
try
the
verdict
not
bad
a
solid
scottish
ale
this
malty
brew
goes
down
smooth
not
the
head
of
the
class
maybe
but
its
everything
it
should
be
great
label
and
name
however
not
sure
how
this
got
into
the
scotch
ale
category
from
a
taste
perspective
this
is
likely
to
temper
my
comments
tasted
more
like
a
brown
very
clean
pour
and
taste
improved
as
it
warmed
nice
looking
color
but
not
a
lot
of
depth
better
than
ave
nothing
remarkable
drink
i
wanted
something
new
at
hooters
and
this
was
the
best
i
could
get
it
was
my
bad
to
not
ask
for
a
different
glass
oh
well
still
like
hangar

on

about

the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
caramel
and
some
fruity
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
mild
spice
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
nice
dark
and
bitterish
aftertaste
this
must
be
my
favorite
hangar
24
beer
from
the
12
oz
bottle
bought
at
bine
vine
in
san
diego
o
a
solid
winter
beer
but
nothing
crazily
good
about
it
i
enjoyed
the
effort
in
the
end
but
this
isnt
a
beer
i
would
actively
seek
out
local
beer
for
me
only
beer
empyrean
makes
im
find
if
and
they
hit
it
out
if
the
park
taste
lightbodied
smooth
crackery
nutty
malts
golden
syrup
tea
leaves
golden
fruits
gum
faint
watery
smokiness
bone
dry
finish
lingering
smoke
o
suggest
for
people
who
like
new
castel
brown
ale
a
bit
of
a
heavy
buzz
for
5
3
abv
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
amazing
either
overall
alright
at
best
i
would
never
buy
it
again
nor
would
i
recommend
it
to
anyone
while
it
wasnt
so
bad
as
to
lead
me
to
drain
pour
it
nothing
impressed
me
about
it
dirty
bastard
is
one
of
my
favorites
of
this
style
and
this
falls
way
short
of
that
if
youre
going
to
buy
this
kind
of
beer
just
get
dirty
bastard
or
even
loch
down
not
bad
but
far
from
being
a
beer
id
run
back
to
weak
and
underwhelming
all
around
theres
a
mild
charred
grain
and
brown
sugar
depth
to
things
but
its
pretty
wimpy
overall
altogether
a
bit
light
on
the
scottish
style
but
a
nice
enjoyable
brew
on
its
own
merits
pours
a
nice
copper
in
color
with
a
small
offwhite
head
lots
of
lacing
was
seen
with
each
sip
perfect
carbonation
the
aroma
is
of
roasted
malts
with
some
caramel
sweetness
very
pleasant
the
taste
was
even
better
than
the
aroma
actually
with
a
touch
of
smoke
very
easy
to
drink
and
no
harsh
bitter
aftertaste
o
this
was
a
solid
scotish
ale
more
peatysmokey
then
most
ive
had
but
i
enjoyed
it
i
dont
know
if
the
sediment
in
my
bottle
was
normal
which
i
dont
mind
or
not
but
it
seamed
exesive
someone
explain
to
me
how
this
is
a
scottish
ale
unless
its
a
dumbed
down
sort
of
version
for
the
masses
because
theres
nothing
authentically
scottish
about
this
the
pour
is
mostly
clear
golden
maybe
a
tad
darker
like
so
many
of
their
beers
a
good
inch
of
head
on
top
the
nose
is
sweeter
but
the
malt
profile
is
indeed
lighter
than
i
am
used
to
in
the
style
not
much
hops
to
speak
of
but
an
earthen
character
that
makes
me
ready
for
a
big
gulp
refreshing
too
light
for
the
style
again
but
crisp
in
the
finish
for
the
sweetness
nothing
too
interesting
here
but
a
sessionable
english
pale
ale
style
with
a
medium
to
light
body
and
enough
bubbles
to
wash
away
some
of
the
spicy
food
they
serve
at
lazlos
there
overall
im
not
too
impressed
with
this
but
theres
nothing
wrong
with
it
either
kind
of
par
for
the
course
maybe
a
little
better
for
nebraska
overall
i
do
enjoy
this
beer
but
its
almost
too
damn
drinkable
its
got
some
good
notes
in
the
taste
profile
and
with
the
low
abv
it
makes
it
a
good
session
beer
on
its
own
merits
this
is
a
better
than
decent
beer
though
other
than
the
smoke
character
in
the
flavor
which
isnt
exactly
per
style
either
there
is
nothing
that
really
screams
scottish
just
a
bit
of
a
chocolate
character
and
itd
be
closer
to
northern
english
brown
another
highly
drinkable
style
again
fairly
tasty
beer
flaws
are
easily
ignored
and
it
drinks
easy
id
have
it
again
just
not
when
looking
for
anything
authentically
scottish
overall
a
very
straightforward
beer
not
to
much
going
on
here
very
average
this
beers
good
its
easy
to
drink
and
flavorful
overall
this
is
what
a
scottish
style
should
be
light
bodied
with
a
little
smoke
finish
this
style
can
be
confused
with
a
scotch
ale
that
has
an
much
more
body
and
smoke
flavor
burning
skye
is
an
excellent
example
of
what
i
enjoyed
in
the
scottish
pubs
very
sessionable
and
flavorful
this
will
be
a
regular
in
my
beer
fridge
overall
it
has
a
few
certain
things
to
it
i
cannot
put
my
finger
on
it
is
an
enjoyable
brew
if
you
can
find
it
or
live
in
nebraska
try
it
would
i
buy
a
sixer
of
this
sure
a
dark
yet
clear
amber
color
more
carbonation
than
i
would
have
liked
the
beer
came
with
absolutely
no
head
i
dont
know
if
the
bartender
messed
up
or
if
this
is
how
the
beer
is
supposed
to
be
poured
appearance
wise
this
is
not
what
i
was
expecting
smells
of
sweet
roasted
malt
and
caramel
tastes
pretty
much
exactly
like
it
smells
sweet
roasted
malt
and
caramel
dry
finish
overall
i
thought
this
beer
was
a
poor
representation
of
the
style
but
was
still
a
decent
brew
comments
good
beer
really
refreshing
with
a
great
copper
color
d
ive
had
a
number
of
these
now
and
it
is
pretty
decent
drink
i
was
already
six
deep
at
this
point
and
i
wanted
to
try
something
different
and
this
didnt
help
i
was
not
a
fan
and
if
i
go
back
to
ne
probably
wont
have
this
one
again
d
very
drinkable
scottish
for
a
less
cold
and
blustery
day
a
summer
scottish
d
this
is
an
okay
ale
but
it
falls
short
of
looking
like
a
scottish
ale
and
doesnt
deliver
as
much
flavor
as
i
expect
in
a
scottish
ale
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
perhaps
this
beer
would
be
more
appealing
if
it
were
a
different
style
at
first
i
thought
this
was
just
ok
but
as
the
beer
warms
theres
more
more
strange
and
not
good
strange
flavors
coming
off
of
it
doesnt
rise
to
mediocre
am
not
planning
on
polishing
off
all
12
ounces
disappointing
d
goes
down
easily
not
filling
ok
representation
of
style
body
is
a
bit
thin
flavoring
is
quite
muted
drinkable
but
not
one
that
i
would
reach
for
again
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
enjoy
by
710
into
a
sam
adams
perfect
pint
pours
a
cloudy
yelloworange
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
way
out
of
style
a
light
scent
of
malts
in
the
nose
but
not
much
there
after
letting
it
warm
a
bit
i
can
sense
a
little
smokiness
in
the
backround
taste
is
pretty
bland
not
much
malt
presence
for
the
style
some
toastbisciut
almost
has
a
slight
sourness
to
it
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
the
carbonation
level
leaves
the
mouth
dry
not
a
very
good
example
of
a
scottish
style
ale
d
not
a
great
beer
i
wouldnt
have
another
one
even
though
the
abvs
on
most
their
lineup
are
low
enough
to
have
been
legal
in
iowa
prior
to
the
recent
change
in
the
alcohol
laws
empyrean
beer
only
started
appearing
on
local
stores
in
the
past
several
months
after
trying
third
stone
brown
and
now
burning
skye
scottish
ale
we
werent
missing
much
dvery
high
this
is
the
quintessential
session
beer
great
flavors
in
light
amounts
i
miss
empyrean
ales
they
do
a
fine
job
d
very
easy
drinking
especially
for
a
scottish
ale
abv
is
low
very
sessionable
not
filling
d
while
not
the
most
interesting
of
beers
i
dont
have
any
problems
with
it
at
all
its
pretty
easy
drinking
and
certainly
would
go
well
with
a
pulled
pork
sandwich
d
yeah
it
also
is
on
the
thin
end
of
the
style
d
a
pretty
tasty
offering
from
empyrean
this
easy
going
session
beer
is
pretty
good
in
any
season
there
is
however
something
slightly
off
puting
about
the
sweetness
over
time
my
first
foray
into
scotch
beers
and
i
loved
it
i
had
this
beer
on
tap
at
lazlos
in
lincoln
ne
the
color
of
this
beer
was
lighter
than
expected
most
scottish
ales
i
have
had
were
darker
and
had
a
rich
earthy
nose
the
color
and
nose
of
this
beer
is
much
lighter
it
is
a
light
orangegold
in
color
with
a
very
light
malt
nose
the
flavor
is
very
light
as
well
i
do
pick
up
malt
and
a
very
slight
smoky
peaty
flavor
but
very
little
overall
the
mouthfeel
is
very
light
with
moderate
carbonation
while
its
one
of
the
best
i
tried
from
the
empyrean
brewing
company
it
still
comes
off
as
watery
and
too
light
in
body
an
interesting
beer
sweet
and
light
makes
for
easy
consumption
but
will
also
give
you
cavities
overall
a
little
to
tangy
but
kind
of
tasty
at
the
same
time
decent
brew
that
captures
some
of
the
intended
scotch
ale
peat
campfire
character
and
with
crisp
wellattenuated
malts
enough
hops
to
balance
but
not
enough
to
compete
with
the
sweetness
or
the
prominant
smoky
character
lightly
phenolic
plastic
and
smoke
with
a
big
bruised
apple
flavor
and
quite
yeasty
finishes
mostly
crisp
with
a
linger
of
the
apple
fruity
flavors
good
beer
but
the
apple
is
a
bit
distrating
and
a
better
malty
body
would
have
drastically
improved
the
beer
i
drank
this
brew
on
new
years
eve
after
a
couple
of
domestic
brews
and
i
drank
it
straight
from
the
bottle
the
first
whiff
of
this
brew
was
nice
a
semi
sweet
fragrance
this
brew
has
a
great
mouth
feel
and
a
nice
finish
this
is
my
first
experience
with
a
scottish
ale
but
i
like
it
enough
to
sample
some
more
ah
the
skye
is
burning
me
lads
ive
had
this
beer
a
few
times
and
i
always
have
felt
i
got
me
shillings
worth
pours
a
light
amber
into
the
mug
maybe
a
caramel
color
is
a
better
way
of
saying
it
mine
are
out
of
date
as
they
say
drink
by
101207
or
something
like
that
maybe
thats
why
the
head
is
a
bit
weaker
than
i
remember
tis
a
good
beer
to
be
sure
i
like
the
malty
profile
with
the
sweet
butterscotch
finish
i
remember
reading
somewhere
that
this
beer
goes
good
with
barbecue
chicken
jolly
ho
i
believe
whoever
said
that
was
on
to
something
one
must
sip
this
beer
to
enjoy
it
i
plan
on
getting
some
of
these
for
next
summer
when
i
fire
up
the
grill
and
smoke
some
legquarters
will
make
a
good
fire
putteroutter
as
well
as
thirst
quencher
mind
ye
i
dont
be
using
just
any
beer
for
pouring
over
my
bbq
body
is
a
touch
light
but
its
plenty
drinkable
ive
had
better
but
its
still
a
fine
scottish
ale
pours
a
nice
cleanclear
dark
golden
amber
color
nice
carbonation
tiny
fizzy
offwhite
head
some
sticky
lacingin
around
the
edges
the
nose
is
malty
slightly
piney
and
lots
of
caramel
the
taste
is
bitter
malty
piney
and
lots
of
caramel
the
finish
is
dry
medium
body
drinkable
a
nice
tasty
brew
flavor
is
decent
with
some
caramel
and
toffee
and
just
a
bit
of
grain
again
some
general
sugary
sweetness
too
no
hops
or
alcohol
anywhere
on
the
flavor
the
beer
drinks
very
easy
but
isnt
the
most
enjoyable
flavor
decent
but
certainly
not
great
overall
a
very
clean
drink
wouldnt
hurt
for
some
more
complexity
but
what
can
you
do
without
using
hops
drinkability
good
this
is
a
great
example
of
a
90
schilling
ale
very
clean
and
complex
the
body
is
fairly
full
from
all
of
the
caramel
malts
carbonation
seems
a
little
much
for
the
style
but
it
still
feels
fairly
creamy
even
despite
the
prickly
burning
sensation
on
the
palate
a
decent
allaround
beer
definitely
one
of
the
more
unique
examples
ive
had
though
that
isnt
necessarily
a
good
thing
nor
is
it
really
a
bad
thing
it
just
is
what
it
is
i
would
definitely
consider
drinking
it
alongside
a
glass
of
scotch
whisky
which
means
i
might
pick
up
a
bottle
or
6
in
the
future
no
aroma
to
speak
of
if
i
inhaled
hard
enough
i
could
pull
in
some
malt
notes
taste
was
more
of
a
hoppy
pa
than
scottish
ale

but
it
did
have
some
subtle
notes
of
malt
and
caramel
to
at
least
make
it
average
watery
and
thin
i
wouldnt
spend
any
hardearned
cash
buying
a
sixer
if
there
were
a
6th
cattegory
for
sound
this
one
would
get
a
5
for
the
snapcracklepop
d
more
or
less
nondescript
not
a
bad
representation
for
the
style
but
not
a
top
pick
either
pretty
good
beer
for
the
style
just
not
my
favorite
i
wouldnt
recommend
consuming
more
than
one
of
these
at
a
single
sitting
received
in
a
trade
with
jhammerly
enjoyable
clean
and
refreshing
poured
into
an
imperial

a

color
slightly
hazy
mild
white

about
a
12
inch
thick
receded
to
a
slight

smell
is
mildly
sweet
like
caramel
a
bit

honeyfloral
notes
taste
is
predominantly
malt
but
there
is
the
slightest
hint
of
hops
honey
is
present
but
not
overly
sweet
a
subtle
smokiness
blended
in
mouthfeel
has
a
nice
crisp

medium
bodied
this
is
very
drinkable
could
easily
be
a
session
beer
drinkability
good
easy
drinker
not
sure
how
representative
of
the
style
this
one
is
though
pairs
well
with
certain
foods
as
suggested
foods
in
the
menu
drinkable
and
interesting
although
definitely
not
much
of
a
scottish
ale
on
tap
at
buzzard
billys
lincoln
ne
pours
a
one
finger

that
fades
quickly

3
75
for
a
16oz
glass
drinks
pretty
good
i
enjoyed
it
but
the
sweetness
prevents
this
from
being
a
session
ale
i
reccommend
it
just
the
same
a
pleasant
suprise
several
of
empyreans
beers
seemed
like
watered
down
versions
of
the
beer
types
they
were
supposed
to
represent
including
this
one
their
oatmeal
stout
and
their
honey
gold
i
thought
this
was
strange
maybe
in
nebraska
they
play
it
safe
with
their
brewing
although
thunderhead
in
kearney
gets
everything
right
so
that
theory
doesnt
hold
water
cheers
i
remember
having
this
beer
a
few
years
ago
i
havent
bought
it
since
and
might
not
again
doesnt
measure
up
to
empyreans
brown
or
porter
the
taste
is
mostly
malt
but
sweet
like
syrup
or
a
molasses
at
the
end
there
is
a
citrus
hop
flavor
that
is
light
and
blends
with
the
malt
but
really
it
seems
too
much
hops
the
body
is
light
and
it
has
a
slightly
watery
characteristic
to
it
nothing
is
saying
take
me
home
and
i
will
be
your
significant
other
a
not
unpleasant
brew
this
burning
skye
scottish
style
scottish
style
ale
from
empyrean
brewing
co
but
its
not
blowing
up
my
skirt
either
because
in
my
humble
opinion
this
is
no
scottish
style
ale
special
to
brent
bditty
for
sending
in
the
package
of
ne
beers
all
in
all
the
cask
version
of
burning
skye
scottish
ale
is
an
improvement
over
the
other
versions
of
the
beer
and
is
definitely
something
id
enjoy
to
have
again
in
the
future

off
quickly
there
is
no
lacing
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
sweet
and
malty
some
orange
and
white
grape
aromas
a
little
bit
of
a
yeasty
character
as
well
the
taste
is
also
sweet
and
fruity
pear
and
grape
flavors
and
a
little
bit
of
caramel
sweetness
certainly
doesnt
taste
like
a
scottish
ale
the
mouthfeel
is
just
a
little
watered
down
the
drinkability
is
good
though
a
good
beer
but
definately
not
a
scottish
ale
thanks
to
bditty
for
the
bottle
707
overall
a
solid
beer
but
its
not
what
i
expect
from
a
scottish
style
ale
big
thanks
to
bditty187
for
the
bottle
props
to
my
friend
bditty187
for
this
one
felt
a
little
thin
but
with
the
mix
of
flavor
and
the
mildness
of
the
flavor
i
could
drink
many
of
these
a
rough
pour
brings
up
a
good
sized
head
of
frothy
offwhite
foam
it
drops
shortly
to
a
half
inch
or
so
but
holds
well
from
that
point
on
and
leaves
some
minor
lace
the
amber
body
is
just
slightly
hazy
and
fine
bubbles
can
be
seen
slowly
rising
towards
the
surface
a
touch
of
smoke
and
a
gently
toasty
malt
are
present
in
the
nose
the
smokiness
is
far
from
overwhelming
and
accentuates
the
malt
nicely
the
body
is
medium
and
the
soft
carbonation
gently
caresses
the
tongue
its
smooth
and
lightly
creamy
across
the
palate
a
softly
sweet
and
mildly
biscuitytoasty
malt
carries
through
the
majority
of
the
flavor
only
truly
revealing
its
subtly
smoky
side
in
the
finish
well
balanced
well
brewed
satisfying
and
very
drinkable
all
in
all
a
complex
and
very
tasty
scottish
ale
from
nebraska
thanks
to
bditty
for
sending
it
up
here
pours
a
medium
amber
color
with
a
thin
and
creamy
white
head
that
quickly
fades
into
a
collar
of
lace
nose
is
sweet
with
notes
of
dark
malts
and
honey
light
to
medium
in
body
and
thinner
than
i
was
expecting
taste
is
sweet
toasted
malts
and
grains
blended
some
notes
of
honey
followed
by
some
mildly
bitter
hops
but
the
sweetness
wins
out
not
great
but
certainly
something
id
drink
again
if
i
had
the
opportunity
thanks
to
bditty187
for
the
sample
clear
copperybronze
hue
slight
tawny
influences
too
it
is
a
pleasant
color
but
i
cant
help
but
think
it
is
going
to
be
thin
tasting
this
is
not
a
good
first
impression
a
very
hard
pour
is
required
to
produce
a
head
of
a
finger
in
height
it
faded
quickly
to
a
very
sparse
soapy
collar
subsequent
lacing
was
absent
this
is
my
number
one
grievance
with
empyrean
the
head
retention
of
all
of
their
core
beers
are
lousy
the
nose
is
unique
with
a
mix
of
chocolate
malt
honeylike
sweetness
and
a
trace
of
faint
hops
spice
the
potency
is
very
limited
it
seems
more
inadequate
on
this
sample
that
i
am
reviewing
than
others
ive
had
over
the
years
ill
still
review
it
as
i
smell
it
the
palate
reminds
of
an
oktoberfeststyle
lager
with
smoked
peatbarley
and
chocolate
malts
added
the
hoppiness
is
a
little
strong
for
a
scottish
ale
which
this
beer
is
trying
to
be
on
the
other
hand
the
maltiness
is
a
touch
thin
but
with
both
of
those
negatives
stated
i
find
burning
skye
to
be
a
tasty
beverage
it
works
well
with
bbq
it
is
on
the
simple
side
but
i
find
it
tasty
medium
in
body
the
carbonation
is
low
and
typical
for
the
brewery
it
is
also
plenty
drinkable
it
is
a
solid
offering
from
empyrean
and
a
beer
worth
trying
if
you
are
visiting
the
cornhusker
state
overall
i
grew
up
in
the
northeast
of
england
and
during
the
70s
and
80s
mcewans
was
part
of
scottish
newcastle
and
therefore
an
almost
ubiquitous
presence
in
the
pubs
usually
in
the
form
of
mcewans
best
scotch
30odd
years
down
the
line
and
things
have
changed
beyond
recognition
champion
is
a
bit
too
heavy
and
malty
for
a
session
beer
but
its
a
mightly
tasty
pint
thats
worth
taking
your
time
over
hopheads
will
no
doubt
look
elsewhere
but
theres
a
lovely
malty
fruitiness
here
thats
worthy
of
more
than
just
a
cursory
glance
recommended
o
big
scottish
breweries
dont
have
a
good
rep
in
england
tramp
juice
factories
but
this
is
very
nice
and
included
in
the
3
500ml
bottles
for
5
offer
at
morrisons
so
deriitely
good
value
overall
well
balanced
if
a
little
sweet
a
good
example
of
the
style
this
beer
is
a
great
ambassador
for
the
scottish
ale
overall
it
is
very
pleasant
a
very
warming
beer
i
would
imagine
would
be
perfect
for
winter
evenings
and
with
a
flavour
which
is
strong
but
not
overpowering
mfg
website
www
mcewans
co
uk
the
alcohol
phenols
on
the
finish
seem
a
bit
offensive
and
this
suffers
from
balance
issues
in
places
i
did
think
the
flavour
was
quite
good
at
points
but
it
never
seemed
to
balance
and
join
together
it
became
hard
to
drink
honestly
with
the
high
strength
they
might
have
bitten
off
more
than
they
can
chew
the
last
time
i
had
this
i
remember
it
being
better
so
much
raw
alcohol
coming
through
this
is
really
bad
on
the
end
as
it
warms
no
complexity
and
tastes
increasingly
like
discount
vodka
avoid
on
the
first
taste
its
soon
apparent
that
this
is
a
quite
a
sweet
and
strongish
warming
ale
mildly
carbonated
and
full
bodied
with
toffee
fudge
and
caramel
notes
launching
at
you
the
lack
of
initial
hopped
bitterness
to
calm
the
sweetness
down
seems
a
bit
odd
at
first
but
then
it
eventually
makes
its
slow
appearance
under
all
that
sweet
caramelised
toffee
apple
exterior
subtle
and
subdued
but
enough
to
make
the
overall
experience
a
pleasant
one
i
find
this
beer
a
nice
easy
to
drink
sweet
and
strong
ale
ideal
for
those
cold
winter
nights
in
and
at
4
bottles
for
only
5
at
my
local
asda
its
a
real
bargain
too
httpyoutu
befmti9oxa09w
this
is
an
ok
beer
the
abv
is
much
higher
than
most
scottish
ales
ive
tried
so
far
it
tastes
decent
but
not
great
the
innes
and
gunn
scottish
ale
was
better
httpabarwithnoname
wordpress
com1001beers
im
not
sure
how
this
stacks
up
to
other
strong
scottish
ales
but
its
worth
seeking
out
to
try
drinkability
far
too
strong
to
have
more
than
one
bottle
would
probably
be
too
rich
anyway
but
one
bottle
is
a
warming
comforting
experience
d
a
very
nice
beer
indeed
heavy
filling
warming
and
above
all
satisfying
i
will
buy
it
again
recommended
drank
this
chilled
but
as
it
warmed
up
it
became
much
more
raw
and
overwelmingly
boozy
and
confected
still
a
bit
simple
to
be
honest
d
a
delicious
strong
ale
from
scotland
strange
how
this
is
gordons
scotch
ale
that
is
brewed
for
the
belgian
market
but
the
abv
has
been
lowered
from
the
8
5
abv
for
belgium
to
7
3
for
the
british
market
although
the
alcohol
content
has
been
lowered
it
is
still
a
warming
beer
great
for
sipping
on
a
cold
evening
as
it
is
today
even
though
it
is
almost
june
dgood
on
its
own
but
it
seems
to
fill
a
role
like
port
as
an
after
dinner
drink
or
something
i
would
want
with
an
appetizer
spread
or
a
cheese
course
d
dangerously
moreish
very
drinkable
i
like
my
big
malty
beers
and
this
was
no
exception
a
fantastic
malty
smooth
experience
with
a
delicate
hop
bite
in
the
finish
preventing
it
from
being
too
sweetsyrupy
delicious
decent
mouthfeel
but
this
is
a
little
too
sweet
and
the
alcohol
really
shines
in
this
drinkable
and
solid
scotch
ale
a
good
beer
but
nothing
spectacular
or
very
remarkable
definitely
a
fine
drinker
though
md
smooth
with
a
medium
carbonation
goes
down
quite
easily
nice
drinking
beer
but
one
is
enough
definitely
a
drinkable
brew
but
its
not
one
id
want
all
the
time
for
2
reasons
the
sweetness
is
a
bit
overpowering
and
the
abv
is
too
high
for
a
regular
drink
in
my
opinion
this
is
a
truly
remarkable
beer
especially
considering
that
its
from
a
large
commercial
brewery
its
rich
taste
stands
out
above
all
it
has
a
slightly
sweet
and
nutty
taste
with
loads
of
caramel
chocolate
malting
and
a
unusual
but
refreshing
hoppy
bite
almost
overpowering
like
an
ipa
its
well
priced
too
at
least
in
english
supermarkets
it
has
a
very
impressive
gravity
too
i
would
love
the
opportunity
to
sample
this
on
cask
taste
is
sweet
with
clear
notes
of
diacetyl
a
lot
of
malt
covered
with
caramel
malt
some
hints
of
smoke
and
caramelization
the
mouthfeel
is
sticky
and
leaves
a
layer
of
sweet
caramalt
in
my
mouth
the
spices
are
just
detectable
they
add
a
spicy
herbal
and
a
little
medicinal
taste
drinkability
a
good
beer
by
any
measure
this
beer
grew
on
me
as
i
drank
it
rich
is
too
strong
a
word
to
describe
it
although
the
label
does
well
off
or
comfortable
would
be
better
terms
to
use
will
i
have
another
yes
but
not
tonight
i
scored
this
low
on
drinkability
purely
on
the
strength
7
3
is
too
strong
for
me
to
drink
all
night
however
once
you
have
been
an
innitiate
of
mcewans
champion
ale
you
will
return
for
more
a
thoroughly
excellent
beer
why
is
there
not
more
like
this
on
the
market
poured
a
deep
ruby
with
a
thick
off
white
head
which
diminished
to
a
nice
layer
plenty
of
thick
lacing
left
on
the
glass
the
smell
was
similar
to
a
wine
raisins
prunes
dark
fruity
the
initial
treacle
flavour
gave
way
to
a
blackcurrantliquorice
combo
with
a
hint
of
pepperyness
and
a
lingering
bitterness
this
felt
heavy
in
the
mouth
and
had
a
warming
effect
due
to
the
alcohol
content
in
fact
the
alcohol
was
very
noticeable
and
became
a
bit
too
much
as
the
pint
diminished
hence
the
3
way
too
heavy
to
session
on
and
a
bit
sticky
but
nice
as
a
one
off
id
say
i
did
struggle
to
finish
it
i
dont
think
ill
be
having
this
again
but
im
glad

is
not
an
overstatement
since
of
the
mcewans
beers
ive
tried
this
is
the
best
by
far
but
because
of
the
richness
a
full
pint
of
this
stuff
is
a
lot
for
one
sitting
not
that
i
didnt
thoroughly
enjoy
it
overall
not
a
bad
brew
but
a
little
too
sweet
and
unbalanced
very
boozy
i
swirlled
a
mouthfeel
and
it
left
my

with

soooo
much

mouthfeel

it

very
quaffable

the

let
it
down
that

i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this

a
rather
unimpressive
beer
that
lacks
any
real
taste
at
all
simply
one
of
the
cheapest
beers
available
ontap
in
scotland
it
lacks
any
flavour
notes
or
character
fine
as
a
beer
when
you
have
already
had
a
few
but
not

something

if

is
nothing

here
just
easy
to

with
a

more
going
on
than

macros
uk
or

most
places
i
have
been
to
in

carry
this
and
is
a
good
standby
if
no

is
available
avoid
like
the
plague
md
this
was
brought
to
me
from
scotland
and
i
was
told
it
is
very
popular
i
would
have
preferred
a
bottle
but
oh
well
this
is
definitely
a
session
brew
that
has
a
smooth
mouthfeel
the
malts
jump

caramel
brown

great
malty
most
are
scottish
beer
despite
its
low
alcohol
content
im
not
sure
how
much
i
could
drink
probably
because
of
the
sweetness
and
the
fact
that
it
doesnt
taste
great
i
mean
its
not
terrible
about
on
par
with
the
majority
of
english
ales
ive
had
but
decent
at
best
flavour
is
again
a
little
corny
and
adjuncty
mildly
refreshing
and
not
as
sweet
as
some
others
in
this
style
although
it
gets
sweeter
as
it
warms
up
light
mouthfeel
but
not
too
bad
i
think
this
beer
would
be
significantly
better
on
tap
or
especially
on
cask
quite
a
pleasant
experience
pours
a
dark
copper
with
a
half

good

the
beer
has
a
really
inviting

slight

and
just
a
little
hops
very
well
balanced
mouthfeel
was
quite
good
as
well
the
beer
is
lightmedium
bodied
and
ends
somewhat
dry
overall
i
really
enjoy
this
ale
and
would
drink
it
anytime
either
as
a
session
or
just
to
enjoy
one
a
great
all
round
beer
readily
available
in
scotland
except
edinburgh
dont
know
why
beer
was
a
dark
copper
with
a
white
bubblyfluffy
head
that
was
good
initially
nose
was
a
hint
of
the
malts
and
not
much
else
has
my
nose
gone
bad
in
the
uk
i
am
not
sure
why
this
is
called
a
scottish
ale
as
this
was
very
hoppy
there
was
a
light
to
medium
mouthfeel
but
lively
on
the
palate
at
4
5
abv
this
was
a
very
sessionable
beer
there
is
a
slightly
smoky
roasted
somewhat
creamy
caramel
malt
flavour
here
which
coupled
with
refreshing
carbonation
makes
more
impact
than
one
expects
from
the
wrong
section
of
the
supermarket
aisle
there
seem
to
be
just
enough
hops
here
to
give
it
some
bite
if
i
have
to
buy
a
can
for
less
than
a
quid
this
will
probably
be
the
one
pours
thick
with
a
medium
head
good
hops
and
malt
in
the
smell
very
good
physical
appearance
taste
is
stronger
than
a
lot
of
ipas
this
being
more
full
bodied
and
darker
slight
peet
character
overall
this
is
great
india
pale
ale
this
is
on
par
with
mcewans
scotch
ale
i
will
drink
this
again
cost
permitting
a
terrific
starter
beer
for
th
evening
looks
richly
copper
and
moderately
carbonated
just
off
from
white
head
with
good
retention
and
lacing
smells
sweet
with
malt
caramel
and
slight
bitter
and
sour
tastes
of
caramel
and
malt
sweetness
underlined
toffee
toastedness
butter
pop
corn
and
mild
fruitiness
fruits
of
plumbs
and
peaches
although
mild
also
a
bit
nutty
an
also
buttery
coat
to
the
mouth
with
a
medium
body
thins
through
the
finish
revealing
more
nutty
and
hop
flavor
a
most
drinkable
session
ale
fresh
from
the
tap
i
think
this
beer
is
underrated
yeah
im
not
so
great
at
picking
out
the
subtleties
of
malt
heavy
beers
so
sue
me
a
decent
ale
perhaps
a
bit
unbalanced
however
too
fizzy
aswell
this
ale
is
all
about
toffee
i
like
my
scots
less
sweet
a
little
more
herbypeaty
and
eventempered
that
said
this
is
a
delightful
ale
smells
like
pungent
toffee
as
if
toffee
could
spoil
tastes
sweet
and
toffeeish
which
gives
way
to
a
modest
sour
bitter
carbonation
finish
redeeming
the
ale
which
would
otherwise
strikes
a
cloying
syrupy
mouthfeel
note
the
conditional
at
any
rate
the
beer
ranks
somewhere
this
side
of
the
line
toward
very
good
the
ale
to
serve
when
your
friends
claim
that
beer
aint
food
this
is
nothing
more
than
outofdate
ipa
its
the
same
colour
with
the
same
aromas
and
tastes
as
their
ipa
just
a
bit
more
stale
the
mouthfeel
is
also
that
of
wet
cardboard
and
the
drinkability
suffers
a
great
deal
as
well
not
that
this
stuff
is
horrible
but
the
regular
ipa
is
much
much
better
in
my
database
it
is
a
9
3
out
of
10
and
in
my
top
ten
out
of
a
little
over
500
beers
its
also
a
decent
value
compared
to
most
of
the
other
scottish
ales
notes
wasnt
expecting
much
didnt
get
much
subpar
taste
dragged
down
this
brews
drinkability
my
first
introduction
to
scottish
style
ales
and
got
me
hooked
definitely
smoother
with
a
little
more
kick
than
what
passes
for
beer
from
american
mainstream
breweries
i
still
like
it
even
though
i
have
expanded
my
exposure
to
scotch
ales
a
little
thin
on
pouring
and
when
it
first
hit
the
mouth
but
makes
it
extremely
drinkable
on
all
kinds
of
weather
if
you
want
to
introduce
a
friend
to
this
particular
style
this
is
the
one
you
want
not
much
else
to
say
althouhg
it
was
very
drinakble
and
was
priced
wher
eit
should
be
in
quality
i
remember
having
a
few
of
cans
newcastle
brown
ale
a
few
weeks
back
this
is
what
i
find
this
beer
is
very
similar
to
overal
45
an
easy
drinking
tasty
scotch
ale
doesnt
try
to
be
anything
its
not
and
balanced
quite
well
lacks
a
bit
in
body
o
very
drinkable
recommended
and
a
decent
mouthfeel
makes
a
right
little
treat
on
a
cold
friday
night
i
quite
like
this
one
a
good
show
for
the
malts
without
getting
too
sweet
good
drinkability
o
given
the
style
it
could
easily
have
used
a
bit
of
a
flavour
boost
too
mild
for
my
liking
and
by
no
means
better
than
average
for
the
style
taste
is
nice
and
similar
to
the
smell
with
the
malt
bitterness
but
also
some
sweetness
and
roastiness
overall
pretty
easy
going
but
you
still
get
some
nice
flavours
each
sip
solid
offering
final
grade

a
highly
drinkable
ale
with
an
undemanding
but
moreish
flavour
the
sweetness
grainy
notes
and
mild
bitterness
all
blend
perfectly
to
create
a
pleasing
beer
well
worth
sampling
if
you
encounter
it
better
luck
next
time
caledonian
luckily
i
have
a
fresh
weihenstephaner
caledonian
80
should
be
exactly
what
you
think
of
when
you
close
your
eyes
and
imagine
a
scottish
ale
it
has
a
distinctive
peaty
character
that
portrays
the
true
charm
of
scotland
something
that
north
american
or
english
brewers
are
simply
incapable
of
capturing
it
certainly
earns
a
spot
alongside
haggis
in
the
scots
gastronomic
highlight
reel
d
nothing
seriously
deep
or
interesting
about
this
but
its
easy
to
drink
and
quite
flavourful
the
smokiness
is
what
really
dominates
the
taste
making
it
somewhat
difficult
to
get
down
quickly
but
the
sweetness
backing
it
up
is
a
good
balance
not
bad
not
amazing
id
drink
it
if
someone
offered
it
one
of
the
better
examples
of
the
style
may
it
always
be
brewed
in
direct
flame
open
fire
kettles
in
slateford
d
very
drinkable
but
nothing
special
tastes
just
like
a
standard
scottish
ale
almost
like
a
red
ale
to
me
this
is
successfully
maltdominant
without
being
overly
sweet
that
being
said
while
an
enjoyable
beer
more
than
one
would
probably
be
too
much
would
have
enjoyed
more
fruity
hoppiness
which
wouldve
definitely
helped
its
drinkability
for
me
surprised
at
how
good
this
one
was
i
want
more
one
can
isnt
enough
quite
sessionable
i
must
say
pours
a
amber
colour
with
thin
head
with
a
small
amount
of
lacing
on
some
parts
of
the
glass
smells
of
caramel
and
bread
with
maybe
the
faintest
hint
of
hops
small
bitterness
but
more
sweetness
comes
through
in
the
flavour
fairly
thin
mouthfeel
i
would
like
to
try
this
on
cask
as
i
suspect
it
would
be
much
better
drink
a
nice
well
rounded
beer
that
has
a
little
of
everything
the
richness
of
a
dark
beer
but
the
refreshing
aspect
of
a
light
beer
pours
a
nice
rich
and
clear
orangered
with
a
moderate
head
but
no
lacing
very
enjoyable
aroma
with
notes
of
caramel
toffee
and
bread
taste
has
many
of
the
same
notes
but
it
seems
thin
at
times
almost
watery
no
substantial
bitterness
nor
hop
aroma
the
thinness
is
the
only
drawback
to
the
beer
killing
the
mouthfeel
nevertheless
an
enjoyable
and
drinkable
beer
this
is
amazing
a
great
cask
offering
one
of
the
best
scottish
ales
i
have
come
across
there
is
really
no
smoky
peat
character
but
what
is
here
is
really
unique
a
perfect
example
of
a
scottish
brewery
pushing
the
bounderies
highly
recommended
to
say
the
least
pleasant
enough
drinking
if
not
exceptional
only
the
faintest
of
aromas
not
the
best
in
that
department
flavour
is
chiefly
sweet
and
malty
nicely
carbonated
pretty
much
no
bitterness
at
all
good
session
beer
but
prefer
deuchars
ipa
from
this
brewery
would
like
to
try
on
tap
and
have
spotted
it
somewhere
so
may
report
back
d
drinks
very
nicely
would
be
a
good
session
beer
definitely
a
good
choice
certainly
better
than
the
tennents
that
started
the
night
caledonian
80
pours
a
bright
amber
with
a
nice
lingering
layer
of
head
the
aroma
is
malty
and
fruity
with
some
caramel
toffee
and
butterscotch
the
flavor
is
nice
and
malty
and
a
bit
sweet
without
being
cloying
there
is
a
bit
of
ripe
dark
fruit
and
some
darker
crystal
toasted
sweetness
some
light
buttery
diacetyl
comes
through
in
the
end
the
finish
is
crisp
and
almost
heavy
very
flavorful
for
a
beer
of
its
strength
a
decent
enough
session
ale
but
a
bit
on
the
sweet
nonbitter
side
for
me
though
d
okay
light
body
beer
nothing
memorable
aroma
is
faint
but
there
is
malt
woodsmoke
and
barley
colour
is
a
gorgeous
browngold
colour
taste
is
malt
with
a
woodsmoke
aftertaste
great
mouthfeel
and
good
balance
funny
that
they
call
this
a
bitter
since
there
is
very
little
bitter
taste
to
it
overall
this
was
definitely
a
better
experience
than
what
i
had
on
tap
but
i
certainly
would
still
maintain
that
this
beer
is
mediocre
at
best
try
it
if
you
must
but
i
wouldnt
recommend
it
its
drinkable
enough
i
suppose
but
not
one
id
seek
out
again
any
time
soon
mouthfeel
thin
watery
and
smooth
low
carbonation
and
quite
refreshing
slightly
course
in
the
finish
yes
definitely
drinkable
but
not
great
will
try
again
though
it
is
really
too
sweet
and
malty
i
rarely
leave
beer
behind
and
had
to
force
myself
to
finish
this
one
but
the
same
brewery
makes
deuchars
which
is
delightful
md
the
beer
had
a
medium
body
to
it
the
carbonation
was
not
noticeable
due
to
the
cask
very
smooth
creamy
and
one
could
drink
this
all
day
long
overall
a
good
beer
and
one
that
i
will
try
again
when
given
the
chance
i
had
the
neustadt
earlier
in
the
evening
and
although
this
is
the
higher
regarded
beer
i
preferred
the
local
to
this
still
its
a
decent
ale
and
should
be
a
must
for
lovers
of
the
scottish
styles
altogether
a
wellmade
tasty
beer
high
drinkability
would
love
to
try
again
from
a
different
serving
type
final
thoughts
all
in
all
this
beer
is
better
then
average
and
enough
off
the
beaten
path
to
make
it
an
import
worth
buying
it
does
some
things
right
and
other
things
wrong
but
the
pros
outweigh
the
cons
i
probably
wouldnt
get
it
again
unless
it
was
offered
or
was
the
only
option
but
for
the
most
part
it
was
a
solid
offering
if
you
like
this
id
suggest
newcastle
brown
ale
drinkability
definitely
a
great
choice
lots
of
flavour
and
low
abv
make
it
a
great
beer
to
keep
coming
back
to
pours
a
really
nice
deep
amber
with
a
two
finger
creamy
white
head
smell
is
malty
sweet
with
some
chocolate
and
biscuit
taste
is
very
sweet
but
the
chocolate
becomes
much
less
prominent
a
slight
hop
finish
balances
this
one
out
really
nicely
the
mouthfeel
is
ridiculously
smooth
and
the
drinkability
is
excellent
this
beer
seems
like
a
heavier
one
despite
its
low
alcohol
content
overall
a
really
great
brew
and
would
love
to
have
another
super
smooth
and
velvety
mouthfeel
perfect
cask
ale
easy
to
drink
and
enjoy
several
just
dont
go
looking
for
a
lot
of
complexity
there
is
a
difference
between
the
cask
version
of
this
ale
and
the
bottled
one
the
cask
version
is
a
bit
sweeter
and
smoother
than
the
botteled
beer
this
is
a
good
beer
pretty
textbook
for
a
scottish
beer
note
recently
had
this
on
tap
and
it
was
highly
inferior
to
both
the
cask
and
bottled
versions
much
thinner
without
the
great
flavours
i
realize
im
out
of
the
mold
on
this
one
lets
hope
the
next
reviewer
loves
the
style
and
gets
you
back
on
track
impressed
this
is
good
and
an
ideal
winter

at

i
tried
this
beer
on
november
3
2007
after
purchasing
from
my
local
lcbo
outlet
the
beer
poured
a
very
nice
translucent
red
into
the
glass
with
a
small
white
head
the
aroma
was
a
combination
malt
hops
and
nuts
the
mouthfeel
was
mediumbodied
mild
carbonation
and
creamy
the
flavour
is
malt
nuts
and
a
slight
hint
of
hops
detectable
by
a
slight
bitterness
one
of
the
gold
standards
of
the
style
a
fine
example
of
an
scottish
ale
here
is
a
well
crafted
scottish
brew
i
found
this
quite
appealing
copper
red
and
clear
in
the
glass
with
a
blonde
creamy
head
somewhat
effervescent
throughout
the
nose
was
a
good
sweet
malt
mouthfeel
was
good
a
tart
malt
flavour
with
a
hint
of
strawberry
in
the
finish
which
kind
of
mellowed
the
beer
easy
to
drink
eventful
is
all
i
can
say
more
and
more
it
will
be
the
same
another
round
for
me
and
boys
would
be
nice
all
in
all
a
nice
ale
a
clear
copper
colour
with
an
offwhite
or
cream
coloured
head
about
a
half
inch
initially
reduced
in
time
to
a
lacy
film
that
coated
the
glass
nicely
even
when
almost
finished
a
swish
of
the
glass
brought
back
a
frothy
top
moderate
carbonation
throughout
with
a
mild
watermelon
or
cantaloupe
aroma
just
a
touch
of
floral
boquet
happening
here
the
taste
is
dry
with
balanced
bitterness
and
a
hoppy
character
smooth
texture
and
a
modest
malty
aftertaste
i
found
this
a
wee
bit
gassy
but
still
a
most
enjoyable
ale
that
is
welcome
in
my
refrigerator
anytime
highly
recommended
d
a
classic
scottish
session
ale
pours
a
mediumlight
copper
tone
with
a
very
tight
nitro
head
which
leaves
thick
walls
of
lace
all
down
the
glass
smell
is
distinctly
muted
the
nitro
really
taking
a
toll
here
light
caramel
malts
show
along
with
a
minor
hop
note
you
can
tell
that
theres
more
to
be
had
here
but
the
format
just
wont
let
it
come
through
taste
is
better
deep
caramel
is
at
the
forefront
with
roasted
grains
and
just
a
touch
of
coffee
as
well
light
hop
notes
in
the
finish
with
a
bit
of
scotch
as
well
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
watery
but
has
plenty
of
body
and
drinkability
is
quite
good
not
bad
but
id
much
rather
get
it
without
the
nitro
to
see
what
it
really
ought
to
taste
like
a
nice
drinkable
ale
caledonian
brewery
is
always
pretty
reliable
alot
of
my
buddies
drink
this
beer
straight
from
the
can
so
have
i
and
decided
to
give
it
a
proper
review
pours
from
the
can
a
deep
rich
amber
with
about
a
two
finger
head
the
head
ever
so
slowly
disipates
leaving
a
small
amount
of
lace
herbal
hop
scent
upfront
with
some
malt
toffee
and
caramel
lingering
in
the
nose
taste
is
light
and
sweet
some
toffee
and
caramel
candy
slight
bready
taste
and
enough
grassy
and
herbal
bitterness
to
make
it
refreshing
bes
of
all
this
is
a
smooth
beer
its
almost
like
drinking
homogenized
milk
smooth
creamy
delicious
full
body
and
nice
very
drinkable
both
as
a
session
beer
and
as
a
complex
beer
as
well
overall
delicious
final
statement
a
scotish
take
on
an
irish
cream
ale
lackluster
looks
good
but
has
little
flavour
stick
to
kilkenny
pours
a
clear
coppery
red
with
an
expansive
tightly
packed
offwhite
head
that
is
here
to
say
for
the
night
the
aroma
is
lots
of
malt
some
toffee
and
a
bit
of
wood
and
smoke
finally
after
months
upon
months
of
hoppy
beer
madness
which
i
definitely
love
it
is
nice
to
finally
have
a
malty
scotch
ale
to
welcome
the
fall
sweet
malty
front
getting
plesantly
woody
and
fruity
mainly
raisins
in
the
middle
with
some
mild
hops
and
raisins
creeping
in
at
the
end
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
somewhat
thin
and
not
cloyingly
sticky
i
am
looking
forward
to
the
fall
and
hope
to
try
more
fine
ales
like

i
was
surprised
at
how
crisp
and
hoppy
this
beer
isrelatively
speaking
for
a
scotch
ale
its
good
dont
get
me
wrong
i
was
just
expecting
it
to
be
more
malt
heavy
deuchars
ipa
is
still
my
favorite
of
their
range
and
one
of
my
top
uk
beers
canned
sample
dark
amber
light
brown
in
colour
with
medium
carbonation
aromas
of
mild
fruit
minerals
and
a
bit
of
chocolate
more
mild
fruit
in
the
mouth
along
with
notes
of
roasted
malt
a
bit
of
caramel
and
some
interesting
fruityearthy
hop
combo
medium
body
an
above
average
canned
bitter
a
nice
surprise
from
the
kenora
lcbo
the
taste
is
truly
great
very
easy
to
drink
with
a
great
combination
of
roast
malt
with
a
hint
of
caramel
sometimes
bordering
to
a
very
slight
hint
of
chocolate
once
swallowed
this
leaves
a
suttle
refreshing
hint
of
citrus
not
too
heavy
that
it
cant
be
drunk
all
night
but
meaty
enough
to
enjoy
just
a
couple
of
excellent
both
on
tap
or
in
the
bottle
one
of
the
best
beers
in
scotland
overall
an
ok
good
beer
theres
just
something
missing
from
this
one
probably
still
worth
a
try
though
this
isnt
really
my
style
of
beer
its
a
nice
deep
caramel
colour
and
pours
with
a
thin
quick
to
vanish
head
its
very
malty
and
sweet
it
starts
off
with
some
interesting
flavours
but
leaves
too
much
sugar
in
the
rinse
still
its
pretty
good
for
out
of
can
this
isnt
a
completely
fair
trial
though
since
i
did
eat
a
fresh
basil
leaf
earlier
which
is
going
to
throw
the
taste
off
pretty
damn
good
a
nice
change
of
scottish
beers
for
me
because
im
so
used
to
drinking
wee
heavies
can
poured
a
deep
amber
color
ale
with
a
foamy
slightly
offwhite
head
with
good
retention
aroma
of
sweet
malt
is
really
enjoyable
good
caramel
malt
presence
is
also
easily
noticeable
and
very
enjoyable
subtle
bitter
hops
closing
are
also
nice
tasted
more
like
a
scottish
ale
but
then
im
no
expert
with
the
english
style
of
beer
a
very
well
put
together
ale
just
made
for
sessions
pours
a
clear
orangered
small
and
loose
white
head
forms
little
spotty
lacing
some
retention
smell
is
sweet
and
malty
brown
sugar
peat
and
caramel
taste
is
sweet
grassy
peat
smoked
middle
some
smoky
caramel
in
the
finish
a
nice
nuttiness
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
with
low
carbonation
tons
of
flavour
for
the
abv
and
a
bargain
at
just
over
2
for
a
pint
can
i
think
this
will
be
my
session
beer
of
choice
from
now
on
had
it
on
nitro
tap
once
and
the
can
is
much
better
d

this
copper

with
nice

lots
of

fresh

at

easy
drink
muted
peaty
scottish
taste
creamy
lots
of
malt
and
caramel
leaving
a
sweetish
aftertaste
not
too
much
depth
of
character
but
will
take
over
a
molson
any
day
or
night
all
i
have
to
say
is
get
this
you
wont
be
disappointed
drinkability
good
easy
to
drink
and
not
at
all
heavy
this
is
a
great
scottish
ale
especially
on
tap
its
redolent
with
many
malt
flavors
try
it
if
you
ever
make
your
way
to
the
angel
inn
i
love
the
way
these
cans
pour
poured
a
hazy
browninhamber
liquid
with
creamy
tannish
head
smell
is
a
delightful
combination
of
toasted
malt
dark
fruits
dates
plums
cherries
and
a
strong
whiskey
scent
taste
is
also
superb
with
a
goodly
amount
of
toasted
malt
and
caramel
combining
with
an
almost
milklike
creaminess
it
almost
feels
as
if
each
taste
is
giving
me
a
milk
moustache
more
caramel
in
the
finish
which
is
very
pleasant
an
excellent
easydrinking
beer
if
you
see
a
can
buy
it
you
will
not
be
disappointed
as
it
truly
is
the
closest
youll
get
to
a
real
scottish
pint
even
though
youre
5
hours
behind
the
pubs
in
alba
and
it
comes
in
a
can
md
smoothness
resulting
from
the
good
structure
between
maltiness
and
restrained
bitterness
is
clearly
felt
deep
down
the
palate
while
the
freshness
of
this
beers
condition
makes
it
consistently
lively
on
the
tongue
overall
a
delicious
malty
bitter
at
such
low
alc
strength
and
a
rare
treat
on
cask
deep
down
south
in
london
rather
than
up
north
in
edinburgh
it
could
even
be
a
good
session
beer
poured
a
deep
rich
amber
color
with
a
thinner
slightly
off
white
headsweet
malt
dominated
aromas
but
that
was
expectedcaramel
and
cherry
with
maybe
a
little
brown
suger
thrown
in
mild
but
flavorful
in
my
opinion
caramely
sweet
and
nicely
toasted
grain
but
some
herbalminty
hop
comes
thru
in
the
finsh
adding
to
the
drinkablity
of
this
nice
little
ale
a
real
session
ale
here
something
that
could
be
drank

i
assumed
it
to
be

upon

very
light
and
an

a

in

and
a
lovely
light
scottish
ale
ill
have
another
please
toddnov

o
pretty
drinkable
but
nothing
super
special
overall
a
rather
disappointing
beer
it
lacks
the
depth
and
complexity
of
a
maltcentric
scottish
style
being
generally
weak
and
unimpressive
overall
no
i
wasnt
looking
for
a
heavyier
scotch
ale
styling
here
but
i
did
expect
a
richer
feel
and
presence
overall
the
flavors
and
mouthfeel
come
across
weakkneed
and
insipid
with
little
malt
boldness
within
the
taste
or
feel
a
relatively
surprising
dud
from
ballast
point
nicely
done
a
fine
tasting
example
of
the
style
but
its
the
feel
that
throws
me
a
little
on
this
one
cool
to
have
a
beer
from
these
guys
thats
neither
hoppy
or
real
dark
and
intense
seems
those
make
it
to
the
market
less
this
looks
thin
for
what
it
is
more
caramel
than
brown
in
color
but
with
a
nice
inch
of
khaki
creamy
head
on
top
of
it
quite
clear
too
the
nose
is
fine
a
touch
of
peaty
smoke
and
molasses
sweetness
under
a
drying
european
style
yeast
strain
the
flavor
matches
the
nose
almost
exactly
but
add
just
a
dab
of
vanilla
and
an
unexpected
hop
bitterness
like
green
tea
on
the
back
end
its
not
as
heavy
on
the
smoke
and
roasty
malts
as
the
style
usually
is
which
is
fine
but
the
feel
being
so
light
i
think
is
a
turn
off
i
need
a
little
more
meat
to
these
and
while
i
like
the
idea
of
a
session
type
scottish
it
just
doesnt
really
pan
out
here
still
the
quality
of
the
beer
is
enormously
high
like
all
ballast
stuff
and
i
like
the
unique
mellowness
of
the
malt
bill
cool
beer
but
i
prefer
their
hoppy
stuff
quite
a
bit
more
disappointed
i
really
like
ballast
point
and
i
think
they
rep
west
coast
styles
so
well
but
damn
did
they
miss
the
bus
with
this
english
pub
ale
almost
generic
totally
misses
the
scotch
ale
style
for
me
o
a
great
price
for
a
bomber
a
sessionable
ale
to
share
with
friends
just
nothing
exciting
unlike
so
many
other
ballast
point
creations
worth
a
try
at
this
price
o
what
id
expect
for
a
scottish
ale
im
not
sure
id
buy
it
again
but
glad
to
try
it
if
it
was
a
dollar
more
i
wouldnt
have
bothered
a
standard
pour
yields
three
plus
fingers
of
ultra
lush
light
khaki
colored
froth
goodness
that
displays
a
bit
of
a
rocky
top
as
it
settles
rock
star
retention
the
color
is
a
translucent
carmelly
lighttomedium
brown
a
light
to
moderate
bit
of
slightly
sluggish
micro
sized
carbonation
the
nose
displays
a
heavy
dose
of
light
brown
sugar
to
start
there
are
light
notes
of
caramel
and
toffee
lots
of
bready
malts
just
a
slight
whiff
of
peat
simple
and
straight
forward
the
palate
is
rather
uneventful
some
dark
bread
malts
a
hint
of
brown
sugar
perhaps
some
peat
not
much
else
very
understated
in
terms
of
overall
flavor
profile
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
bodied
a
bit
thin
and
slightly
watery
limited
carbonation
goes
down
easy
enough
but
highly
uneventful
a
simple
but
unspectacular
scottish
ale
not
bad
but
aside
form
a
stellar
appearance
there
isnt
much
to
experience
or
remember
here
i
personally
think
there
is
a
severe
shortage
of
scottish
and
scotch
ales
in
the
current
craft
beer
marketplace
but
unfortunately
this
one
doesnt
fill
the
void
pours
a
dark
auburn
red
with
a
very
thin
brownish
yellow
head
the
aroma
is
very
one
note
its
almost
entirely
sweet
caramal
malt
with
subtle
dark
fruit
notes
the
flavor
is
top
notch
very
dark
very
creamy
tastes
like
a
rich
english
toffee
this
would
be
greatly
improved
with
a
nice
rum
barrel
aging
ballast
point
continues
to
disappoint
not
worth
the
relatively
cheap
price
id
grab
a
belhaven
wee
heavy
everyday
over
this
one
eh
mediocre
not
bad
but
certainly
not
ballast
points
best

overall
this
starts
off
nice
in
the
nose
and
at
first
glance
but
doesnt
really
go
anywhere
not
overly
complex
a
little
bland
but
worth
a
shot
i
love
scottish
ales
but
this
is
just
a
little
meh
for
my
taste
not
the
awesomefest
ive
come
to
expect
from
ballast
point
but
a
good
solid
brew
the
beer
is
chewy
with
medium
carbonation
and
a
touch
too
sweet
o
i
really
like
this
brew
not
sure
why
the
ba
score
is
so
low
it
has
a
nice
set
of
flavors
and
isnt
overpowering
beer
really
needs
to
warm
up
before
the
nose
gets
released
and
the
flavors
show
themselves
and
by
then
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
pushing
watery
very
soft
nose
begrudgingly
gives
up
caramel
and
a
hint
of
peat
taste
is
quite
muted
and
muddled
with
the
caramels
darker
almost
burnt
meh
as
another
reviewer
indicated
its
not
incredibly
complex
but
it
does
have
a
nice
taste
d
this
is
a
really
nice
brew
to
pick
up
every
now
and
then
far
from
being
my
favorite
amongst
the
style
as
its
not
incredibly
complex
nor
does
it
give
you
much
to
think
about
it
is
however
well
crafted
and
quite
tasty
overall
its
a
fine
example
of
a
scottish
style
ale
but
nothing
im
crazy
about
i
prefer
scotch
ales
o
did
not
taste
like

o
i
am
not
a
big
scottish
ale
fan
but
i
dig
this
one
probably
the
best
scottish
ale
i
have
had
and
i
could
probably
survive
being
in
a
uk
pub
if
this
one
was
on
draft
all
night
overall
a
decent
approachable
scottish
though
the
more
i
drank
and
the
warmer
it
got
the
more
downhill
it
went
suggestion
dont
try
to
savor
it
o
some
qualities
of
this
beer
show
promise
but
it
just
does
not
come
together
for
me
perhaps
my
least
favorite
bp
brew
ive
picked
up
while
this
meets
the
criteria
for
a
scotch
ale
im
not
sure
whether
the
slight
diacetyl
flavor
and
faint
peaty
are
really
there
or
whether
im
just
being
hopeful
unexceptional
pours
a
deep
amber
thats
close
to
a
dark
cola
color
smells
of
some
sweet
tablet
and
some
brown
sugar
syrup
subtle
dark
fruits
and
a
touch
of
some
roasted
caramel
malts
taste
has
tons
of
caramel
sweetness
with
notes
close
to
that
of
some
scottish
tablet
very
light
on
the
tongue
and
leaves
a
bit
of
body
behind
carbonation
is
a
little
on
the
lower
side
the
smell
definitely
compliments
the
subtle
roasted
malts
and
dark
fruits
overall
i
was
really
excited
to
try
it
and
im
glad
i
did
its
a
solid
very
drinkable
scottish
style
ale
that
wont
leave
you
feeling
overly
imbibed
or
full
if
i
were
in
the
mood
for
this
style
on
a
summer
day
this
one
might
be
my
first
pick
otherwise
it
might
not
hold
up
to
the
body
of
others
in
its
style
on
those
cold
dark
days
pours
a
rich
clear
amber
with
a
half
finger
light
tan
colored
atop
that
settled
into
a
frothy
mass
aromas
are
on
the
sweet
side
with
alot
of
caramel
and
brown
sugarlight
toast
lingers
caramel
and
vanilla
malty
flavors
dominate
the
flavor
profile
from
beiginning
to
end
with
just
a
hint
of
toastiness
not
bad
but
one
of
the
more
one
dimensional
scottish
ales
i
have
had
in
its
sweetness
very
drinkable
beer
a
solid
starter
beer
for
someone
looking
to
try
out
scottish
ales
low
c
o
mediocre
beer
unfortunate
not
what
i
expected
form
a
scotch
ale
but
not
bad
pours
a
clear
dark
copper
with
a
khaki
head
that
settles
to
an
oily
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
toasted
malt
and
caramel
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
mild
bitterness
that
quickly
fades
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
but
straightforward
and
simple
beer
on
tap
at
the
pearl
in
point
loma
overall
an
enjoyable
fundamentally
sound
example
of
the
style
recommended
check
it
out
if
you
like
malty
brews
smooth
nice
body
on
this
one
easily
drinkable
medium
carbonated
and
and
light
bodied
while
being
slightly
creamy
highly
drinkable
scottish
ale
with
an
expressive
malt
body
but
lacking
in
aroma
d
very
easy
to
drink
this
sort
of
rides
the
line
between
a
scottish
export
80
and
a
true
wee
heavy
though
i
think
it
is
really
a
weaker
rendition
of
the
latter
d
this
was
a
fairly
decent
beer
and
would
be
a
good
starter
beer
for
someone
looking
to
try
out
scottish
ales
i
say
that
because
the
flavors
of
these
types
of
beers
can
be
a
bit
overwhelming
so
the
tame
flavors
would
be
a
good
segue
well
done
take
on
the
style
here
by
ballast
point
with
just
the
right
amount
of
balance
between
the
malt
spice
and
smoke
remaining
on
the
lower
side
of
the
abv
style
spectrum
kept
this
nicely
drinkable
overall
this
has
the
potential
to
be
a
good
beer
however
as
it
stands
now
im
not
quite
sold
nose
is
up
front
with
caramel
malt
and
butterscotch
flavors
it
gives
a
sense
of
an
upcoming
sweetness
that
never
materializes
a
bit
of
alcohol
can
be
found
on
the
nose
as
well
as
the
tongue
taste
is
similar
to
the
nose
and
offers
a
very
long
finish
on
the
malt
flavors
of
butterscotch
segue
to
a
somewhat
spicy
finish
with
a
hint
of
pepper
cinnamon
and
brown
sugar
offers
a
very
nice
feel
partly
i
would
assume
from
the
style
and
partly
from
the
beer
engine
drink
is
good
and
would
be
higher
if
not
for
the
abv
d
a
simple
and
straight
forward
scotch
ale
pours
dark
brown
with
a
quickly
dissipating
tan
head
carbonation
level
may
be
low
for
some
but
just
fine
for
my
personal
taste
very
slight
notes
of
carmel
on
the
nose
but
not
much
aroma
seems
to
open
up
a
bit
as
it
warms
overall
a
good
scotch
ale
that
i
will
drink
again
d
tasty
very
tasty
scottish
dont
miss
this
one
really
disappointed
with
this
one
the
color
is
good
a
clear
brown
the
smell
doesnt
have
much
to
offer
and
the
taste
is
much
of
the
same
its
not
a
terrible
beer
but
should
be
labeled
a
light
brown
ale
or
something
this
does
not
remind
me
of
the
scottish
style
ale
in
the
slightest
it
tastes
like
a
watered
down
brown
ale
wont
be
getting
this
again
one
of
my
favorite
sunking
beers
absolutely
a
generous
scottish
ale
with
enormous
nutty
malts
and
a
very
very
low
inclusion
of
hops
a
hint
of
vanilla
and
nutmeg
goes
down
very
easy
and
wanders
on
the
tongue
with
a
hint
of
deep
a
roast
a
roast
almost
coffeelike
and
i
dont
like
coffee
but
this
scottish
ale
is
a
winner
and
will
be
consumed
in
my
household
for
a
long
time
it
is
not
an
all
day
beer
by
any
means
a
good
one
to
have
after
a
meal
of
chicken
over
rice
pot
roast
or
just
a
can
of
pringles
though
company
for
this
beer
to
keep
here
in
the
midwest
scotty
karate
is
by
far
better
and
then
you
have
robert
the
bruce
old
chub
and
dirty
bastard
in
hefty
supply
i
hope
sun
king
isnt
banking
on
this
one
cant
get
over
how
good
this
beer
is
to
enjoy
flavor
is
superb
from
start
to
finish
even
the
last
drink
is
delightful
one
of
my
faves
smooth
scottish
ale
a
plain
as
the
rain
in
spain
i
know
scottish
ale
something
to
drink
with
a
healthy
dose
of
cognitive
dissonance
not
particularly
engaging
or
full
or
well
interesting
and
then
theres
that
stoney
metallic
thing
aach
forget
it
this
beer
just
does
not
hit
my
palate
right
this
one
of
the
few
beers
ive
had
that
seems
to
have
no
flavor
i
gave
it
a
3
because
i
figured
it
was
just
me
o
complex
aroma
but
simple
and
straightforward
flavor
nice
for
dinner
or
a
cool
day

the

on

down
smell

taste

the

and
caramel
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
toast
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
low
level
of
carbonation
with
an
almost
flat
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
with
solid
aromas
and
flavors
for
the
style
this
is
a
very
clean
light
tasting
beer
that
would
satisfy
many
from
the
bud
light
crowd
to
the
adventurous
craft
beer
drinkers
very
good
beer
when
eating
out
it
is
also
decent
in
the
can
sun
king
does
not
do
bottles
from
what
i
can
tell
other
than
a
growler
ive
enjoyed
wee
mac
at
several
different
locations
and
they
all
tapped
it
properly
and
the
taste
was
consistent
very
enjoyable
dinner
beer
goes
well
with
pizza
and
grilled
tenderloin
are
my
two
favorites
id
put
this
more
in
the
realm
of
an
esb
than
a
scottish
ale
watery
with
little
caramel
flavor
and
no
other
qualities
of
a
good
scottish
style
beer
if
it
was
an
esb
id
give
it
a
higher
grade
not
what
i
was
expecting
and
disappointing
for
a
brewery
i
really
like
this
starts
out
pleasantly
enough
but
that
metallic
insistent
bitterness
as
me
heading
toward
the
sink
from
the
16
oz
can
purchased
at
grapevine
liquors
in
denver
o
for
all
the
hype
surrounding
this
beer
and
the
number
of
people
that
told
me
to
go
get
it
and
drink
it
i
am
glad
to
say
i
did
not
pay
for
a
pint
the
bar
was
kind
enough
to
allow
me
to
sample
it
before
i
threw
my
money
away
on
it
i
cant
say
its
horrible
because
it
didnt
make
me
want
to
spit
it
out
or
throw
the
glass
but
i
was
unable
to
see
what
others
find
so
magical
about
it
moral
of
the
story
happy
to
try
it
but
very
glad
i
didnt
pay
for
it
overall
very
thin
and
watery
and
bland
o
sun
king
is
local
so
you
find
this
one
around
town
fairly
frequently
i
am
torn
because
i
do
enjoy
this
beer
and
it
is
a
goto
option
for
me
when
the
choices
are
between
standard
major
brews
and
select
sun
king
options
but
the
description
of
this
as
a
brown
rather
than
a
scottish
seems
apt
owas
expecting
more
from
this
beer
sun
king
usually
does
malty
beer
well
but
this
one
just
wasnt
where
it
should
have
been
pours
a
clear
dark
brown
color
12
inch
head
of
an
offtan
color
decent
retention
and
decent
lacing
smells
of
hops
sweet
malt
slight
yeast
hint
of
roasted
malt
hint
nut
hint
of
coffee
and
slight
pale
malt
fits
the
style
of
a
scottish
ale
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
clean
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
sweet
malt
slight
alcohol
hint
of
yeast
hint
of
roasted
malt
hint
of
hop
and
slight
nut
overall
good
blend
body
and
decent
aroma
overall
unimpressed
especially
because
of
the
price
over
12
for
a
four
pack
of
cans
i
havent
had
much
from
indiana
outside
of
three
floyds
so
i
didnt
know
what
to
expect
but
this
was
just
not
up
to
standard
awfully
thin
for
a
scottish
ale
no
body
at
all
on
this
more
brown
than
red
but
shimmers
of
both
appear
on
the
pour
minimal
cream
colored
head
rises
and
recedes
aromatics
are
fairly
right
on
for
the
style
woody
and
mature
malt
forward
and
a
touch
sweet
whats
missing
for
me
is
the
yeast
it
just
isnt
there
with
its
doughy
fullness
and
sweetness
dominates
the
nose
and
taste
as
a
result
some
malt
richness
in
the
taste
but
its
got
a
hollow
smoke
flavor
and
a
raisin
hit
that
doesnt
really
meld
doesnt
taste
too
bad
though
its
the
feel
that
fails
it
watery
thin
in
a
fall
style
that
demands
some
heft
total
letdown
there
despite
decent
carbonation
it
just
doesnt
stand
up
to
the
depth
of
flavor
here
my
first
beer
from
these
guys
didnt
impress
me
much
at
all
wee
mac
is
a
quite
marginal
attempt
at
making
a
scottishstyle
beer
its
a
pretty
typical
type
of
ale
that
american
microbrewers
with
these
styles
it
simply
lacks
the
malt
depth
complexity
and
dryness
that
make
scottish
ales
so
regal
and
charming
however
wee
mac
is
a
sweeter
brown
ale
with
scottish
ale
influences
o
this
is
a
good
brown
ale
not
what
expected
but
if
youre
into
a
nice
scottish
ale
kudos
bottle
pours
a
mostly
clear
dark
brown
with
reddish
tinges
to
it
and
a
moderate
tan
head
that
quickly
disappears
nose
is
quite
malt
with
some
toasty
and
almost
nutty
tones
taste
isnt
really
sweet
at
all
but
has
some
nice
nuttiness
to
it
ok
but
not
my
favorite
thing
so
do
i
grab
this
after
cutting
the
grass
in
the
summer
not
sure
when
id
really
desire
this
drink
im
a
scotch
ale
fan
but
well
this
one
falls
way
short
im
disappointed
because
i
really
had
my
hopes
up
o
its
a
solid
session
beer
they
hit
the
mark
dead
on
when
they
want
to
produce
craft
beer
for
noncraft
beer
drinkers
i
would
use
this
to
convert
people
from
domestics
very
good
scottish
style
ale
taste
is
mild
and
sweetly
malty
with
more
toffee
tones
and
some
nuttiness
not
a
very
compex
flavor
profile
here
but
very
drinkable
and
sessionworthy
o
decent
scottish
ale
from
sun
king
i
wish
it
had
more
of
the
smokiness
that
i
smelled
in
the
nose
and
it
wasnt
so
sweet
o
another
solid
beer
from
sun
king
this
was
a
very
drinkable
and
pleasant
beer
overall
this
one
let
me
down
quite
a
bit
a
very
thin
and
watery
version
of
a
scotch
ale
wished
this
one
was
heavier
on
the
flavors
it
has
and
thicker
o
this
beer
is
very
light
in
flavor
and
character
with
the
field
corn
flavor
in
the
aftertaste
being
the
strongest
flavor
not
much
there
although
the
beer
being
described
on
the
can
sounds
delicious
very
tasty
and
super
drinkable
my
favorite
from
sun
king
so
far
thanks
to
howard
via
aaron
for
this
one
pours
a
nice
coppery
brown
color
with
a
nice
bit
of
head
decent
scent
very
sweet
and
malty
although
not
very
deep
has
some
slight
caramal
in
the
nose
nice
taste
a
decent
maltiness
with
a
bit
of
toffeecaramal
in
the
flavor
little
hop
characteristics
which
is
fine
for
the
style
slightly
thin
for
an
80
shilling
but
goes
down
quite
well
a
very
nice
nearsession
scottish
ale
o
a
solid
malty
beer
that
is
complex
enough
to
be
interesting
but
still
light
and
easy
to
drink
thanks
again
hosp
a
pretty
great
brown
that
also
tastes
like
an
apaipa
love
the
malts
and
the
rich
hops
as
it
enters
your
mouth
the
hazelnut
smell
tops
it
off
m
very
drinkable
its
like
a
hybrid
beer
that
gives
you
two
styles
in
one
very
easy
to
drink
with
good
coating
and
lighter
body
for
a
scotale
this
was
interesting
almost
like
a
scotch
ale
lite
with
the
hop
component
of
an
american
brown
ale
there
wasnt
really
anything
mind
blowing
here
but
it
was
decently
flavored
enough
with
that
hop
profile
adding
a
good
amount
of
fresh
crispness
here
and
this
overall
drank
rather
easily
thanks
to
the
lower
abv
its
worth
a
look
im
not
too
sure
what
sun
king
was
attempting
to
do
with
this
beer
theres
really
not
much
to
say
about
it
besides
maybe
that
its
a
mildly
acceptable
brown
ale
they
are
worthy
of
greater
beers
recent
beers
have
proven
this
point
but
for
some
reason
wee
mac
is
still
out
there
your
guess
is
as
good
as
mine
overall
this
beer
is
alright
if
youve
been
sipping
hefty
brews
and
want
something
light
and
subtle
nothing
too
special
overall
this
was
the
consensus
worst
beer
of
the
tasting
we
were
surprised
because
we
thought
one
of
the
locals
would
finish
worst
but
it
just
goes
to
show
that
the
grass
isnt
always
greener
o
not
what
i
wanted
from
a
scotch
ale
ive
had
several
scottish
ales
and
this
one
is
nothing
similar
first
off
the
smell
of
this
beer
seems
offensive
the
appearance
of
the
brown
hue
is
almost
like
muddy
water
not
what
i
would
expect
for
a
scottish
ale
the
taste
is
repulsive
extremely
metallic
taste
and
thats
it
the
palate
is
all
the
same
all
the
way
through
watery
metallic
this
is
a
medium
to
light
bodied
brew
with
a
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
the
alcohol
is
well
integrated
but
overall
i
really
feel
like
this
interpretation
of
a
scottish
ale
missed
the
mark
the
label
describes
this
as
dutch
cocoa
and
toffee
but
this
certainly
includes
more
vinegar
fruity
and
tangy
notes
than
what
is
listed
on
the
package
an
average
enough
scottish
ale
though
very
unexciting
and
an
unfortunately
terrible
aroma
always
great
to
sample
more
of
the
sun
king
offerings
but
this
might
be
my
least
favorite
so
far
copper
ale
with
mostly
gold
highlights
shining
through
in
spite
of
being
a
wee
heavy
slightly
off
white
head
falls
quickly
strong
malt
nose
wo
any
hops
noticed
but
theres
a
stale
bread
smell
thats
rather
unpleasant
strong
diacytl
i
believe
diacytal
flavors
butterscotch
and
staleness
continue
in
the
taste
sour
and
off
flavored
and
the
mouthfeel
is
watery
im
generally
beer
adventurous
but
extremely
disappointed
with
this
beer
and
having
a
hard
time
finishing
it
avoid
pours
a
crystal
clear
solid
copper
brown
color
with
a
good
sized
creamy
white
head
that
slowly
dissipates
but
leaves
some
spotty
lace
in
its
wake
now
this
beer
is
still
quite
cold
freshly
poured
after
coming
out
of
the
regular
refrigerator
but
most
of
what
im
getting
from
the
aroma
is
an
almost
tart
fruitiness
as
this
warms
it
opens
up
a
little
and
i
get
more
malt
with
sweet
caramel
and
toffee
bread
and
hints
of
dark
fruit
taste
is
mild
toffee
and
caramel
up
front
followed
by
some
tart
and
dark
fruits
for
the
dry
finish
medium
body
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
and
a
slick
sugary
mouthfeel
this
one
is
a
bit
weird
theres
a
tart
almost
metallic
thing
going
on
the
aroma
the
body
is
a
bit
to
thin
for
the
style
and
the
flavor
should
have
more
rich
caramelburnt
sugar
maltiness
in
it
but
it
doesnt
this
one
kind
of
falls
short
of
expectations
taste
it
flat
bland
boring
lightish
body
forgettable
finish
im
searching
and
searching
for
something
interesting
in
this
one
something
significant
and
rewarding
and
im
coming
up
short
utterly
uninspired
this
one
o
very
drinkable
my
first
from
sun
king
ive
an
osiris
waiting
the
cpj
o
easy
drinking
not
huge
flavors
but
very
well
put
together
and
very
good
at
what
it
does
which
is
be
an
everyday
drinker
nice
malt
and
carmel
tones
nice
touch
of
combining
scottish
and
brown
ale
components
o
a
decend
canned
scottish
ale
nothing
that
blows
one
away
but
its
a
nice
easy
drinking
beer
nonetheless
poured
from
a
can
into
a
pint
glass
cloudy
light
brown
with
minimal
cream
colored
foam
dissipated
quickly
to
a
light
film
with
a
ring
very
little
smell
i
get
a
little
malt
but
not
much
else
taste
is
light
almost
washed
out
there
is
some
malt
caramel
maybe
hops
but
it
is
tough
to
tell
the
carbonation
is
high
and
somewhat
off
putting
very
sharp
and
an
assault
to
the
tongue
overall
i
didnt
really
enjoy
this
beer

do
a
nice
simple
easydrinking
craft
beer
enjoyable
nice
to
pick
these
cans
up
during
recent
travel
tasty
low
abv
beer
in
cans
sweet
smells
malty
and
roasty
no
hops
on
the
nose
lots
of
sweetness
tastes
rich
and
malty
roasty
overall
a
bit
bland
but
solid
representtion
of
style
good
mouthfeel
overall
not
bad
but
not
something
i
would
drink
again
odecent
beer
made
for
masses
not
beer
enthusiasts
overall
very
sessionable
tasty
scottish
ale
as
i
got
further
and
further
into
it
though
it
came
across
as
being
slightly
more
watery
than
i
prefer
in
this
style
a
pretty
decent
attempt
though
by
sun
king
o
this
beer
was
ok
i
am
not
a
huge
ale
fan
but
for
what
it
was
it
was
pretty
good
this
verision
of
a
scottish
ale
is
very
smmoth
and
almost
sweet
the
malty
toffee
chocolate
aftertones
makes
this
a
perfect
dessert
beer
it
is
thinner
than
many
beers
of
this
style
but
gives
it
an
enjoyable
drinkablity
this
beer
is
best
if
left
at
room
temperature
for
about
10
minutes
so
you
can
pick
up
the
subltey
of
all
the
ingredients
drinkability
this
sun
king
effort
failed
to
cut
the
mustard
o
a
really
drinkable
very
nice
scottish
ale
light
airy
easy
to
pound
in
a
16oz
can
not
my
favorite
style
for
sure
but
this
beer
is
a
good
one
o
the
seas
of
good
beer
flavor
are
never
at
rest
presenting
new
challenges
for
microbreweries
every
single
day
thats
why
i
can
pick
up
four
cans
of
sun
kings
osiris
pa
and
be
perfectly
content
but
four
of
these
would
bring
me
nothing
but
disappointment
ah
well
it
just
goes
to
show
not
every
beer
is
great
and
not
every
brewer
has
its
styles
down
give
these
guys
a
few
years
and
they
might
be
sending
this
one
out
with
the
strength
and
flavor
i
know
they
can
deliver
at
least
thats
what
i
hope
my
first
thoughts
upon
first
taste
were
disappointing
but
that
improved
with
the
rest
of
the
beer
i
thought
the
beer
was
light
on
malt
taste
and
seemed
to
light
for
the
style
perhaps
i
had
higher
expectations
since
i
picked
up
in
indy
on
my
way
back
to
wisconsin
o
not
too
bad
and
very
easy
to
drink
o
overall
a
very
disappointing
beer
overall
not
a
really
complex
beer
but
damn
refreshing
what
i
like
about
this
is
you
can
drink
this
anytime
hotcold
whatever
glad
i
got
to
try
i
would
seek
this
out
again
overall
great
example
of
style
refreshing
and
tasty
overall
this
beer
didnt
impress
me
this
is
the
first
beer
ive
had
from
sun
king
and
to
be
honest
it
doesnt
make
me
excited
to
try
any
more
do
a
real
thirstquencher
better
than
other
scottish
styles
ive
reviewed
would
be
great
in
the
summertime
on
the
beach
as
opposed
to
a
bland
bmc
thanks
for
the
hookup
dannyfrost
o
this
would
be
a
good
beer
for
those
not
liking
beers
with
a
character
something
i
would
drink
when
mowing
the
lawn
or
doing
some
outside
yard
work
wee
mac
scottish
style
ale
is
the
first
beer
i
have
tried
from
the
sun
king
brewery
sun
king
is
one
of
a
growing
number
of
craft
breweries
that
cans
their
beers
pint
cans
it
pours
a
lovely
brown
with
a
nice
malty
aroma
although
when
i
opened
the
can
at
first
i
could
really
smell
the
yeast
little
head
it
has
a
very
nice
malty
flavor
you
tell
they
dont
use
alot
of
hops
in
this
well
it
even
says
it
on
the
can
it
also
says
it
has
a
hazelnuttofee
flavor
i
dont
know
if
i
would
say
that
but
it
has
a
good
flavor
so
thats
enough
for
me
i
would
buy
this
again
o
i
will
drink
em
again
its
not
going
to
blow
your
mind
but
youre
not
going
to
be
upset
about
it
either
slightly
above
average
d
pretty
good
representation
of
the
scotch
ale
style
not
going
to
knock
anyone
out
but
enjoyed
the
beer
and
will
definantly
revisit
it
all
in
all
this
is
a
really
good
beer
a
little
light
for
the
style
but
not
overly
so
good
stuff
i
look
forward
to
trying
more
from
sun
king
o
very
very
nice
drink
sweetness
is
perfect
and
good
malt
balance
good
full
flavors
now
picking
between
which
4
pack
got
much
tougher
looks
like
1
of
each
could
drink
a
4
pack
on
a
nice
cool
evening
d
pretty
damn
smooth
good
flavors
dry
and
easy
drinking
this
one
is
well
suited
for
the
can
d
could
drink
this
all
day
long
drinkability
is
pretty
high
goes
down
easy
and
doesnt
bite
d
very
drinkable
a
fantastic
example
of
the
style
probably
about
60
while
robert
the
bruce
is
about
an
80
with
some
hops
very
different
from
each
other
but
this
one
is
probably
better
impressive
following
the
crack
glug
i
was
looking
at
a
mild
cascade
as
the
beer
produced
two
thick
fingers
worth
of
mochatan
head
with
good
retention
color
was
a
deep
orangishbrownish
amber
with
coppery
highlights
and
nequality
clarity
nose
was
as
malty
as
advertised
and
definitely
had
that
hazelnut
character
that
they
mentioned
i
am
ambivalent
about
hazelnut
in
that
i
do
not
mind
the
flavor
but
i
would
not
want
a
cup
of
fullon
hazelnut
coffee
either
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
the
good
news
for
me
was
that
the
hazelnut
was
indeed
reduced
by
the
cocoa
flavor
yes
it
was
a
very
malty
beer
but
i
can
appreciate
such
things
despite
being
a
selfavowed
hophead
on
the
flipside
though
one
can
at
a
time
is
probably
enough
for
me
the
finish
was
sweet
but
not
cloyingly
so
as
some
beers
in
the
style
are
d
very
drinkable
very
well
balanced
bier
nice
job
from
a
brewery
i
had
not
tried
anything
from
before
nor
heard
much
about
sun
king
welcome
to
my
vocabulary
would
i
buy
more
of
it
definitely
like
their
other
two
canned
offerings
wee
mac
is
solid
and
delicious
sun
king
has
done
a
great
job
in
their
first
year
that
is
for
sure
i
hope
to
see
wee
mac
brown
in
cans
soon
as
hinted
at
in
the
tasting
room
the
can
is
just
as
outrageously
designed
as
osiris
and
cream
dream
yahoo
sun
king
keep
up
the
good
work
deasy
drinking
and
tasty
nothing
huge
but
a
good
balance
and
flavor
profile
sun
king
is
2
for
2
i
could
drink
this
beer
all
the
time
id
really
like
to
pair
it
with
a
cigar
and
help
bring
out
all
those
tobacco
flavors
hiding
behind
the
malt
im
not
sure
i
would
call
this
a
scottish
ale
but
call
it
what
you
want
its
fantastic
sun
king
please
make
your
way
to
south
bend
d
this
is
a
decent
above
average
scottish
ale
its
very
light
sessionable
and
drinkable
also
seems
to
be
an
interesting
somewhat
unique
brew
its
nice
to
sample
someone
elses
locals
occasionally
and
id
like
to
trade
for
more
local
growlers
pours
a
nice
coppery
brown
color
with
a
nice
bit
of
head
decent
scent
very
sweet
and
malty
although
not
very
deep
has
some
slight
caramal
in
the
nose
nice
taste
a
decent
maltiness
with
a
bit
of
toffeecaramal
in
the
flavor
little
hop
characteristics
which
is
fine
for
the
style
slightly
thin
for
an
80
shilling
but
goes
down
quite
well
a
very
nice
nearsession
scottish
ale
drinkablility
this
beer
is
definitely
sessionable
to
my
pallate
this
is
a
delicious
heavy
brew
one
in
which
the
flavor
is
immense
and
the
other
aspects
make
it
slightly
less
drinkable
overall
this
a
decent
american
made
esb
but
not
a
great
one
nice
flavors
of
malt
and
sweetness
and
some
nicely
balanced
hops
but
there
are
better
esbs
out
there
a
good
quaff
but
forgettable
pours
a
clear
dark
brown
with
a
small
beige
head
aroma
and
taste
is
sweet
toasted
caramel
malt
a
bit
of
chocolate
notes
with
some
molasses
with
a
mild
bitter
ending
a
medium
body
moderate
carbonation
overall
nothing
really
outstanding
but
still
a
solid
brew
serving
type
bottle
i
guess
i
like
this
more
than
the
average
number
i
find
it
interesting
and
it
drinks
smaller
than
its
actual
size
o
solid
esb
great
flavors
and
aromas
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
dark
bronze
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
has
some
malts
and
alcohol
taste
is
dominated
by
alcohol
a
bit
of
malts
very
boozy
and
unbalanced
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
overall
not
terrible
but
a
bit
to
strong
alcohol
taste
for
my
liking
o
my
overall
is
higher
than
any
of
the
original
ratings
because
i
felt
this
was
a
very
nicely
balanced
beer
overall
its
a
pricey
and
decent
ale
i
probably
would
not
get
it
again
to
be
fair
this
was
a
bit
strong
but
perfect
for
the
style
by
the
end
of
the
bottle
i
could
certainly
feel
the
alcohol
and
it
went
well
with
the
slight
earthy
hoppiness
that
was
present
after
each
sip
while
this
felt
more
like
an
esb
than
a
scottish
ale
to
me
i
enjoyed
it
a
lot
and
felt
like
it
could
match
up
with
anything
else
currently
on
the
shelf
regardless
of
style
this
was
quite
a
pleasant
surprise

a
tasty
offering
o
nice
drinkable
scottish
ale
odelicious
probably
my
favorite
bitter
that
is
made
in
america
this
beer
seems
to
have
a
lot
going
on
at
once
rather
than
being
layered
and
moving
from
one
profile
to
the
next
it
seems
the
sweetness
from
the
malts
the
bitterness
and
the
perceived
alcohol
all
seem
to
strike
simultaneously
finishes
bitter
as
being
an
esb
would
suggest
feels
a
bit
lighter
in
the
mouth
than
i
was
expecting
given
the
style
and
abv
overall
a
well
crafted
offering
from
breckenridge
notes
decent
scottish
ale
and
a
bit
better
than
i
expected
its
good
but
the
finish
is
a
little
too
much
with
the
hops
there
is
a
nice
biscuityherbalspice
flavor
that
is
tasty
and
enjoyable
but
it
just
doesnt
quite
reach
that
upper
echelon
worth
a
go
especially
when
on
sale
like
i
got
it
but
its
not
going
to
become
a
staple
in
my
fridge
picked
up
a
couple
bombers
of
this
one
at
a
local
store
poured
from
the
bottle
a
clear
reddishorange

with
just
a

i
though
i
bought
3
esbs
this
year
i
got
one
esb
an
american
brown
ale
and
a
scottish
ale
anyways
the
beer
itself
is
pretty
damn
good
it
lacks
the
sophistication
needed
to
be
a
really
good
brew
but
it
tasted
better
as
it
went
on
give
it
a
whirl
if
you
can
find
it
d
pretty
drinkable
scottish
ale
it
wasnt
easy
to
finish
this
brew
but
glad
i
tried
it
i
wouldnt
seek
this
brew
out
again
even
if
it
wasnt
retired
d
i
was
surprised
at
how
quickly
this
ale
of
elevated
abv
went
down
the
alcohol
actually
fades
as
the
beer
warms
d
hard
to
put
the
drinkability
any
more
than
this
since
while
it
tastes
good
the
amount
of
sugar
simply
put
hampers
the
drinkability
almost
making
it
barleywine
like
good
beer
all
around
they
call
it
a
scottish
ale
it
really
shares
nothing
with
that
style
think
imperial
esb
maybe
old
ale
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
a
smooth
amount
of
carbonation
poured
copper
chestnut
with
very
little
head
and
spotty
lacing
smelled
of
heather
and
malt
very
onedimensional
unfortunately
the
flavor
was
the
same
with
some
hint
of
peat
but
overpoweringly
malty
very
thin
and
overcarbonated
especially
for
the
style
not
a
fan
pours
a
deep
mahogany
brown
with
strong
ruby
highlights
when
held
up
to
the
light
light
beige
head
forms
nicely
leaves
fine
speckled
lacing
behind
aromatics
offer
up
some
nice
earthy
hop
accents
amongst
a
nice
brown
alenutty
slightly
smokey
malt
backbone
impressive
to
find
this
in
west
virginia
all
i
saw
was
the
esb
i
wasnt
paying
attention
to
the
extra
not
so
much
an
esb
id
say
scottish
ale
is
definitely
more
appropriate
if
i
had
to
slap
a
label
on
this
one
they
did
away
with
the
471
no
its
just
their
breckenridge
symbol
i
had
a
nice
meal
with
some
good
beer
about
six
years
ago
at
the
lodo
brewpub
across
from
coors
field
slightly
tart
semi
sour
malt
a
bit
astringent
with
dark
tea
tannins
nutty
dark
malt
semi
bitter
finish
tea
leaf
tobacco
and
earthy
smoked
peat
malts
pave
the
way
in
this
extra
esb
mouthfeel
is
bit
thin
i
could
use
more
body
to
match
up
to
the
bold
flavors
but
it
makes
it
drink
pretty
easily
mild
carbonation
drinkability
is
solid
i
wsa
surprised
by
the
alcohol
by
volume
it
doesnt
seem
like
a
7
8
abv
brew
but
its
a
start
for
getting
wv
folk
into
these
types
of
brews
pours
a
great
deep
burnished
copper
color
with
some
nice
initial
head
a
bit
of
lasting
head
but
very
little
lacing
nice
malty
scent
very
deep
with
hints
of
peat
excellent
taste
a
very
thick
and
rich
deep
and
malty
flavor
hints
of
caramel
and
peat
the
slightest
hop
undertone
at
the
end
to
help
with
balance
goes
down
very
smooth
for
such
a
strong
beer
wonderful
scottish
ale
imperial
esb
or
whatever
this
is
supposed
to
be
this
is
good
stuff
toasted
malt
aroma
flows
from
a
light
brown
brew
medium
carbonation
levels
help
spread
the
toasted
maltyness
around
the
palate
there
is
only
slight
bitterness
to
it
with
the
flavor
of
fresh
piney
hops
the
finish
is
smooth
and
malty
sweet
and
ends
with
a
nice
but
subtle
warming
sensation
bottom
line
this
mostly
what
i
expected
from
an
esb
it
is
pretty
good
and
it
is
probably
the
best
beer
i
have
had
from
breckenridge
brewery
overall
i
wouldnt
qualify
as
an
esb
and
i
wouldnt
drink
it
eiter
not
a
great
effort
overall
overall
this
was
a
good
esb
although
im
a
bit
curious
as
to
how
fresh
it
was
still
either
way
its
worth
a
shot
about
half
way
through
the
glass
the
odd
aromas
faded
into
a
light
mineral
note
thus
the
bump
in
smell
score
and
this
became
an
even
better
beer
i
enjoyed
drinking
this
beer
very
fullflavor
and
bodied
and
something
a
little
different
than
ive
encountered
in
a
while
d
this
is
a
unique
beer
it
might
be
best
described
as
a
double
esb
as
such
it
is
hard
to
compare
to
anything
else
it
is
a
good
beer
extra
esb
is
only
the
second
breckenridge
beer
to
earn
a
flavor
score
of
4
0
from
the
likes
of
me
the
brewery
needs
to
do
a
better
job
of
defining
this
offering
for
wouldbe
buyers
but
the
contents
of
the
bottle
are
fine
just
the
way
they
are
not
what
i
was
expecting
from
an
esb
maybe
they
were
aiming
for
an
imperial
esb
overall
a
decent
beer
poured
a
reddish
brown
with
a
modest
head
that
quickly
faded
to
a
collar
the
aroma
was
malty
sweet
the
taste
was
also
malty
as
in
caramel
with
a
citrus
aftertaste
that
came
through
more
as
it
warmed
the
feel
was
surprisingly
full
bodied
with
light
but
adequate
carbonation
drinkability
was
good
a
big
american
take
on
a
big
english
style
i
think
it
works
pretty
well
and
is
interesting
and
tasty
for
what
it
is
its
not
something
i
could
drink
all
night
like
a
regular
esb
but
is
something
i
would
enjoy
again
and
would
recommend
to
others

about

nose
and
flavor
are
of
toasted

fruity
sweet

earthy
hops
slightly
nutty
decent
body
and
ample
carbonation
worth
trying
if
you
stumble
upon
a
bottle
d
the
alcoholic
aftertaste
makes
this
a
little
harder
to
drink
but
i
personally
think
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
d
nothing
to
write
home
about
here
its
a
decent
beer
but
i
wont
be
revisiting
it
d
not
my
style
and
i
thought
this
was
supposed
to
be
an
esb
im
glad
i
tried
it
but
ill
probably
pass
on
this
one
in
the
future

nice

and
one
i
enjoyed
i
would
say
this
does
drink
and
feel
like
an
english
beer
clearly
that
was
their
goal
so
i
say
they
achieved
it
note
well
on

they
do
indeed
say
this
is
a

name
fits
as
is
try
it
if
you
get
the
chance
i
love
this
stuff
i
admit
my
experience
with
the
style
is
limited
to
this
beer
but
i
think
this
would
hold
its
own
against
all
comers
i
keep
this
in
my
regular
rotation
the
taste
reminds
me
a
little
of
rum
and
raisin
toffee
with
a
hint
of
bitterness
ive
never
been
a
fan
of
rum
but
im
enjoying
this
beer
theres
a
very
slight
bitter
finish
to
this
beer
personally
i
like
a
bit
more
but
that
doesnt
detract
from
it
its
still
very
pleasant
and
drinkable
notes
i
drank
one
from
the
sixpack
every
couple
of
months
to
see
how
it
aged
and
this
is
the
last
one
i
let
this
one
sit
too
long
ill
have
to
amend
my
review
when
i
get
a
fresh
sample
d
this
was
a
very
enjoyable
beer
thats
very
easy
to
drink
with
a
nice
balanced
taste
worth
trying
sometime
ok
drinkable
notes
from

pours
a
deep
amber
color
with
a
decent
sized
off
white
head
the
aroma
in
medium
sweet
caramel
malt
nuts
and
earthy
hops
the
flavor
leans
more
toward
the
bitter
side
although
there
is
a
good
malt
presence
medium
bodied
creamy
texture
long
bitter
finish
d
for
a
style
that
doesnt
normally
inspire
unless
on
cask
or
in
the
proper
setting
like
london
this
is
very
enjoyable
generally
clean
i
guess
the
hops
are
lending
that
metallic
taste
that
started
me
out
solid
brew
and
worth
a
shot
d
this
is
definitely
a
sipping
beer
not
sessionable
good
brew
overall
and
i
look
foward
to
trying
other
esbs
d
if
it
wasnt
this
potent
it
would
be
a
great
session
beer
very
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
deep
reddish
brown
with
a
creamy
tan
head
that
leaves
nice
lace
on
the
glass
good
fresh
roasted
caramel
malt
aroma
faint
grassy
hops
tastes
like
i
think
an
esb
should
big
and
malty
sweetness
balanced
with
a
fresh
floral
hop
bite
and
warming
alcohol
that
lingers
on
the
finish
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
and
highly
drinkable
well
made
d
nice
nightcap
beer
too
powerful
for
me
to
want
more
than
one
i
didnt
like
this
beer
at
first
but
it
slowly
grew
on
me
opinion
i
got
this
beer
at
the
recommendation
of
a
good
friend
of
mine
that
has
a
very
sensitive
palate
i
was
hesitant
to
get
an
esb
as
i
normally
dont
care
for
this
style
i
guess
this
one
is
true
to
form
as
i
dont
really
care
for
this
beer
either
i
am
not
saying
that
is
because
it
is
a
bad
beer
i
have
never
really
had
an
esb
that
i
liked
and
this
is
no
exception
i
guess
that
makes
it
applicable
to
the
style
this
is
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
but
is
still
quite
enjoyable
could
use
some
more
toasted
malt
and
hops
for
balance
but
still
a
beer
worth
trying
i
was
surprised
when
i
finished
this
review
and
noticed
that
the
abv
is
7
8
it
doesnt
feel
that
strong
md
slight
hop
aftertaste
not
a
bad
esb
but
one
i
find
a
bit
typical
something
i
would
not
hesitate
to
drink
again
though
chewy
mouthfeel
and
very
dry
aftertaste
for
the
style
overall
definitely
a
decent
beer
but
somewhat
overhopped
for
the
style
and
not
quite
the
truly
authentic
esb
the
label
on
the
bottle
advertises
beer
poured
a
dark

with
a
little
bit
of
frothy

quite
lively
malty

and
a

citrusy
taste
is
fairly
balanced
it
is
quite
malty
up

dominated
by
the
crystal
malts
finishing
with
a
pineycitrus
hop
mouthfeel
is
full
and
it
is
quite
smooth
for
the
style
drinkability
is
good
there
was
a
hint
of
alcohol
warming
with
the
initial
sips
the
brew
glides
nicely
across
the
palate
making
this
quite
easy
drinking
despite
the
higher
abv

into
an
imperial

hearty

and
hints

sour
taste
hits
fast
with
the
deep
hearty
grain
character
goes
a
bit
sour
in
the
middle
and
closes
with
some
muddy
hops
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
quashed
by
the
off
aftertaste
and
drinkability
is
really
not
that
exciting
a
disappointment
for
me
here
whatever
the
answers
i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
am
sad
it
is
a
limited
batch
release
pretty
well
balanced
beer
as
an
esb
should
be
nice
herbal
and
spicy
hoppiness
that
doesnt
over
power
with
more
caramel
and
toasted
malt
in
there
as
well
i
like
this
beer
a

smooth

d
this

as
it

come

i
enjoyed
every

of
it
and
will
look
forward
to
drinking
the
other
five
in
the
six
pack

from

in

and
leaves
a
lingering

overall
this
is
a
fairly
sound
esb
across
the
board
d
good
drinkability
one
or
two
at
a
time
flavorful
beer
in
one
word
awful
woulda
much
rather
had
the
sapporo
i
threw
out
before
this
pour
is
a
nice
dark
maroon
clear
and
the
positives
end
there
unique
malty
licorice
like
very
belgiany
smell
for
some
reason
oh
and
lots
of
alcohol
taste
is
like
a
dark
belgian
but
with
a
load
of
alcohol
ruining
what
pleasant
qualities
lots
find
in
the
aforementioned
part
metal
some
light
bitterness
and
the
drinkability
on
this
is
horrendous
couldnt
stomach
more
than
about
3
ounces
oneofakind
and
thank
god
for
that
the
mouthfeel
is
good
obviously
thicker
than
your
regular
esb
but
i
like
a
full
body
just
a
lightly
crisp
carbonation
a
good
balance
of
sweet
and
bitter
though
i
would
like
to
see
more
of
a
balance
between
aroma
and
flavor
hops
on
top
of
that
afterall
the
aroma
is
very
good
and
hoppy
but
it
tastes
more
like
a
malt
bomb
it
would
definitely
be
much
more
drinkable
if
it
were
built
more
like
a
traditional
esb
d
this
is
one
of
the
better
american
esbs
that
ive
had
it
packs
a
pretty
good
punch
i
would
drink
a
sixer
of
this
and
i
would
probably
go
back
for
more
overall
this
is
a
great
old
aleup
there
with
gd
hibernation
and
dry
dock
hms
bounty
as
one
of
the
best
of
this
style
in
colorado
search
it
out
sip
it
enjoy
it
just
dont
expect
an
esb
a
shock
brew
from
this
brewery
that
has
never
wowed
me
well
this
beer
is
a
saving
grace
and
honestly
a
pure
joy
to
drink
pours
a
ruddy
ruby
nonexistant
bubbles
and
head
great
aroma
though
lots
of
deep
malts
with
some
concentrated
fruit
cup
aromas
peaches
pears
black
cherries
stats
with
bread
then
goes
to
a
hot
syrupy
fruit
the
alcohol
sticks
out
quite
a
bit
in
this
beer
even
when
its
straight
from
the
fridge
a
bit
hard
to
drink
from
the
burn
of
alcohol
lasts
a
little
to
long
to
want
another
one
pours
a
clean
deep
copper
with
hints
of
orange
in
the
color
with
a
light
tan
head
in
the
aroma
a
mix
of
citrusy
and
piney
hops
in
the
taste
a
sweet
malt
and
lots
of
piney
hops
a
smooth
and
very
small
bite
in
the
mouthfeel
and
sweet
piney
hops
in
the
aftertaste
hoppy
more
than
bitter
almost
ipaish
more
than
a
bitter
my
pint
was
served
with
a
thick
dense
cap
of
dark
beige
foam
covering
the
clear
deep
amber
nearly
chestnut
brew
it
had
impressive
head
retention
and
produced
thick
solid
lacing
the
aroma
was
mostly
caramel
and
citrus
with
some
earthy
malt
and
fruity
esters
in
the
background
it
had
an
earthy
bitterness
with
notes
of
grass
and
delicate
citrus
hops
some
toasty
and
caramel
malt
along
with
some
fruit
character
and
hint
of
alcohol
medium
bodied
with
creamy
carbonation
light
warmth
and
a
good
texture
very
tasty
stuff
it
just
seemed
like
the
balance
was
off
a
bit
maybe
due
to
the
increased
abv
but
it
was
still
a
very
enjoyable
pint
drinkability
its
a
swell
brew
though
rather
unsessionable
for
an
esb
abv
and
hop
level
are
a
little
high
but
i
enjoyed
the
bottle
just
the
same
sharp
with
an
herbal
hop
character
at
times
and
at
other
the
thick
chewy
deeply
caramelized
but
not
sweet
malt
takes
over
i
cant
quite
decide
if
this
beer
is
very
well
balanced
or
not
quite
balanced
the
malt
and
hop
character
are
about
equal
but
some
how
they
do
not
mesh
together
quite
as
smoothly
as
they
should
still
this
is
a
tasty
beer
worth
trying
pours
a
clear
very
garnet
hue
nose
is
like
alcohol
notes
and
yeast
flavor
is
bitter
but
the
alcohol
takes
over
and
wrestles
control
feel
is
sticky
on
the
liquid
and
the
carbonation
is
low
this
is
a
mediocre
esb
imo
too
hot
from
the
alcohol
and
definitely
not
balanced
nice
to
try
moving
on
drinkable
eh
kinda
just
dont
read
the
lable
it
is
to
hop
hopped
to
be
very
drinkable
i
love
this
beer
it
tastes
like
a
hoppier
version
of
an
esb
it
may
not
be
perfectly
to
style
but
it
is
still
excellent
an
esb
with
a
twist
mouthfeel
is
good
mediumtolight
bodied
tingles
to
the
taste
buds
easy
to
drink
next
one
will
be
tried
at
cellar
temperature
like
it
it
pours
a
deep
copper
color
approaching
a
rich
mahogany
color
very
thin
head
that
quickly
dissipated
the
beer
does
leave
small
bits
of
lacing
on
the
glass
as
well
i
smell
a
great
deal
of
caramel
going
on
in
the
beer
with
a
blast
of
hops
i
wasnt
really
expecting
i
like
that
though
toasted
malt
also
makes
an
appearance
about
half
way
down
the
beer
a
very
nice
balanced
flavor
of
hops
and
malt
the
hops
take
stage
first
but
the
sweetness
of
the
caramel
flavors
tones
it
down
quite
a
bit
toasted
malt
really
comes
to
life
as
well
on
the
finish
this
is
much
more
in
your
face
than
other
esbs
ive
tried
the
mouthfeel
is
actually
quite
nice
and
full
low
carbination
with
a
nice
bite
both
on
the
front
and
back
of
the
palate
very
drinkable
but
personally
it
would
not
make
a
good
session
beer
for
me
drinks
alright
but
the
hotness
never
completely
fades
will
sit
on
my
remaining
4
for
a
few
months
see
if
this
evenssmooths
out
the
beer
emerges
from
the
12ounce
bottle
a
luminous
brown
the
head
large
and
a
creamy
light
tan
as
it
fades
away
the
lacing
provides
a
thin
veil
upon
the
glass
nose
has
a
rich
malt
sweetness
caramel
and

la
touche
finale
a
hint
of
floral
spiciness
start
is
nicely
malted
sweet
with
a
hop
bite
at
the
back
top
is
moderate
in
feel
finish
continues
the
malty
sweetness
the
acidity
peaceful
as
it
warms
to
the
glass
and
room
the
hops
really
pop
out
a
bit
of
a
rogue
as
esbs
go
but
i
like
it
quite
a
nice
esb
this
brew
a
worthy
offering
from
breckenridge
i
would
most
definitely
get
it
again
given
the
chance
a
unique
esb
but
not
what
i
was
expecting
we
had
this
at
a
beer
tasting
of
a
wide
range
of
american
english
and
european
beers
of
all
styles
this
was
the
standout
for
use
meaning
it
was
one
the
one
that
best
fit
our
tastes
deep
copper
brown
colour
with
a
modest
lacing
it
had
been
open
a
while
pungent
aroma
hoppy
and
warm
caramel
mouthfilling
and
chewy
being
a
londoner
i
always
associate
esb
with
fullers
but
this
is
a
lot
more
concentrated
and
alcoholic
the
former
is
for
quaffing
the
latter
is
for
sipping
d
this
is
a
beer
that
keeps
getting
better
as
you
drink
it
and
as
it
warms
in
your
glass
i
wasnt
expecting
this
much
goodness
from
an
esb
but
i
guess
ive
never
had
a
good
esb
try
one
of
these
on
for
size
it
fits
quite
nicely
d
this
beer
has
a
big
and
bitter
hop
flavor
that
overpowers
much
of
the
malt
flavor
i
think
this
beer
might
improve
with
age
as
the
pure
bitterness
might
die
down
a
bit
very
nice
esb
i
must
say
easy
to
drink
and
enjoy
the
taste
lingers
for
good
easy
drinking
overall
not
a
bad
beer
i
am
most
impressed
i
only
grabbed
one
for
a
sample
but
i
damn
well
will
return
for
a
sixer
i
can
tell
you
that
it
is
not
a
standard
esb
it
has
too
much
malt
to
be
considered
an
esb
but
the
malt
does
an
excellent
job
of
balancing
the
bitterness
of
the
hops
on
the
whole
i
find
this
to
be
one
of
the
best
balanced
beers
i
have
had
in
recent
memory
highly
drinkable
but
at
close
to
8
0
alcohol
you
need
to
watch
yourself
pours
out
like
iced
tea
with
no
bubble
action
and
a
thin
frothed
milk
head
that
doesnt
do
much
leaves
some
decent
lacing
though
smell
is
sweet
heavily
toasted
citrusy
and
piney
frmo
the
hops
and
has
a
medicinal
cherry
cough
syrup
aspect
this
tastes
rather
messy
with
it
starting
off
really
sweet
with
an
odd
and
certainly
out
of
place
banana
flavor
the
esters
in
this
one
are
weird
finishes
with
a
bit
of
citrus
and
pine
and
with
an
assertive
bitterness
very
mild
acidic
edge
in
the
finish
as
well
warms
the
throat
with
alcohol
mouthfeel
is
nearly
flat
with
a
light
yet
slick
body
not
a
fan
of
this
i
was
given
a
12
oz
bottle
of
this
by
my
very
good
friend
kboett77
poured
that
beautiful
esb
color
a
solid
reddishcopper
with
a
light
white
head
smells
and
tastes
of
toasted
barley
nuts
good
dowse
of
piny
hops
nice
clean
finish
lingering
aftertaste
of
the
hops
not
a
strong
beer
but
nicely
balanced
moderate
mouthfeel
appropriate
to
the
style
not
too
watery
or
too
thick
a
very
drinkable
beer
quite
delicious
you
could
have
a
handful
of
these
in
a
row
will
remember
this
as
a
strong
esb
cheers
wow
this
one
was
quite
overwhelming
to
me
nice
ruby
color
on
the
pour
and
that
is
about
where
it
ends
all
i
can
say
is
alcohol
alcohol
and
more
alcohol
on
the
nose
the
tongue
everywhere
tastes
way
too
strong
dominated
the
flavor
i
feel
a
little
cherry
and
maybe
plum
and
alcohol
tough
to
rate
this
one
too
much
to
rate
dark
red
almost
brown
smell
was
malty
and
just
ok
the
taste
was
more
malt
some
caramel
no
hops
that
i
could
find
but
the
alcohol
was
certainly
there
mouthfeel
was
a
little
thick
this
beer
was
alright
but
i
think
if
it
had
a
lower
abv
it
would
be
much
better
because
i
could
drink
more
than
one
and
the
mouthfeel
would
be
thinner
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
herbal
with
caramel
breaking
through
to
keep
this
well
done
beer
in
check
not
quite
quentessential
of
english
esbs
but
good
beer
at
any
rate
a
solidly
malty
base
with
a
hearty
toasty
brown
alelike
body
and
taste
but
swamped
with
citrusy
hops
the
nose
delivers
a
surprisingly
outofstyle
american
hop
aroma
and
a
nonsurprising
colorado
beermaking
attitude
flavors
are
round
of
moderately
toasted
malts
leaving
a
bit
of
toffee
and
caramel
to
add
character
to
the
moderate
malt
taste
and
body
finishes
clean
and
lightly
mintydry
due
to
hops
and
assertive
alcohols
good
beer
but
if
you
want
a
true
esb
then
go
with
an
english
brewery
overall
this
esb
isnt
my
mug
o
beer
its
too
big
and
boisterous
for
me
to
really
enjoy
it
the
flavors
never
seem
to
meld
im
glad
i
tried
it
nonetheless
ppours
up
dark
copper
with
ruby
highlights
the
head
is
thick
and
dissipates
slowly
leaving
a
thin
foam
on
the
top
hops
dominate
the
aroma
i
dont
mean
that
they
are
overpowering
but
that
the
hops
are
what
you
smell
and
they
dominate
the
flavor
too
theres
a
hint
of
roasted
malt
but
the
hops
overwhelm
everything
including
the
alcohol
its
way
to
much
for
me
to
drink
more
than
one
or
two
at
a
time
i
bought
it
in
the
summer
so
its
going
to
have
to
wait
till
fall
arrives
its
a
nice
sipping
beer
overall
impression
you
definitely
have
to
appreciate
hops
to
enjoy
this
beer
but
if
you
do
it
is
nicely
drinkable
and
dangerous
considering
the
abv
this
beer
just
doesnt
work
for
me
unusual
flavors
apparent
nothing
mixes
well
i
wont
get
this
again
the
mouthfeel
is
great
here
very
clean
and
refreshing
which
makes
for
a
great
session
beer
needs
to
be
just
a
bit
more
flavorfull
though
overall
probably
one
of
the
most
friendly
beers
ive
ever
had
rich
full
phat
mouthfeel
a
finish
to
contend
with
overall
a
damn
good
beer
but
its
so
big
im
not
sure
i
would
want
too
drink
more
than
10
growler
from
party
source
in
bellevue
kentucky
hazy
dark
amber
in
color
with
some
copper
highlights
thin
white
head
disappears
quickly
bready
malt
aroma
slight
citrus
and
floral
notes
in
the
background
caramel
and
toffee
notes
as
well
as
a
bit
of
fruit
great
malt
character
balanced
well
with
some
floral
hops
that
seem
to
linger
and
fade
into
herbal
and
piney
flavors
great
body
with
a
lower
amount
of
carbonation
pretty
strong
for
the
style
finishes
with
a
bit
of
fruit
big
but
easy
to
drink
and
enjoyable
overall
this
is
a
okgood
beer
that
has
some
nice
toasted
caramel
malt
flavors
but
a
little
too
light
at
times
definitely
grows
on
you
as
warms
up
so
serving
at
at
least
45
degrees
would
probably
be
best
worth
the
try
and
maybe
worth
going
for
again
overall
a
very
nice
beer
smooth
option
an
above
average
type
this
is
my
goto
beer

they
dont
have
any
specialties

nothing

love
the
food
all
four
peaks
beers
great
food
a
definite
place
to
visit
this
really
is
a
good
beer
just
not
totally
my
style
the
copper
color
is
fantastic
and
it
has
a
decent
flavor
had
it
on
tap
while
going
through
az
and
that
was
better
when
on
tap
it
seemed
to
have
a
little
bit
more
of
a
nutty
flavor
that
stood
out
to
me
of
coarse
i
had
just
been
hiking
around
out
of
africa
so
that
might
have
clouded
my
judgment
i
still
say
drink
some
thank
you
kerry4porters
for
the
chance
to
try
this
beer
thanks
mikedr
from
the
other
site
for
the
opportunity
this
is
a
pretty
decent
scottish
ale
if
you
find
yourself
at
four
peaks
this
is
a
must
order
o
good
tasting
and
attractive
beer
without
too
much
bitterness
i
recommend
it
to
others
i
like
having
flavor
in
the
beer
and
not
feeling
like
it
is
watered
down
o
a
bit
too
light
flavored
for
style
but
then
flagship
brews
are
usually
tame
a
good
malty
ale
clean
and
bright
although
it
seemed
a
bit
too
fizzy
with
the
mouthfeel
very
nice
beer
i
would
certainly
get
some
more
12

hazy

cloudy
orange
copper

with
good
retention
that
reduces
to
a

lingers
spotty

some

phenols
as
well
but
not

bad
some
nice

knocks
it
down

on
the

for
a

with

good
robustness
and
no
cloying
flavors
after
the
finish
the
phenolic
note
was
noticeable
but
not
too
detracting
medium
carbonation
and
body
with
a
lightly
creamy
and
fairly
crisp
mouthfeel
that
is
good
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
with
only
a
slight
warming
noticed
after
the
finish
overall
this
is
a
nice
scottish
ale
good
balance
of
maltfruity
flavors
and
very
smooth
to
drink
a
nicely
enjoyable
offering
i
had
this
beer
on
tap
in
downtown
phoenix
while
on
a
trip
for
a
concert
must
have
drank
about
ten
of
them
by
the
time
the
weekend
was
over
the
taste
is
hard
to
describe
however
i
absolutely
love
it
very
packed
with
caramel
and
toffee
notes
with
a
smooth
hop
profile
i
love
this
beer
glad
to
see
a
solid
attempt
at
a
style
that
seems
to
not
get
a
lot
of
attention
and
even
happier
to
see
it
in
a
place
i
expected
to
be
awash
in
bad
beer
arizona
you
did
not
disappoint
overall
not
bad
for
the
style
just
doesnt
have
any
distinguishing
qualities
my
crack
glug
produced
a
finger
of
lighttan
head
that
disappeared
like
xi
jinping
this
is
a
current
events
allusion
and
may
be
googled
at
your
leisure
color
was
a
tealike
brownishamber
with
nequality
clarity
nose
was
quite
sweet
like
liquid
caramel
mouthfeel
was
thintomedium
and
the
maltiness
was
just
too
much
for
this
selfavowed
hophead
if
it
is
going
to
be
this
sweet
it
should
have
some
more
body
to
it
imho
it
lacked
any
subtle
smoky
quality
which
is
what
i
really
look
for
from
the
style
this
would
be
a
malt
lovers
dream
but
for
me
it
was
over
the
top
finish
remained
very
sweet
and
i
was
happy
to
have
tried
it
but
it
was
a
onceanddone
for
yours
truly
another
beer
courtesy
of
the
creator
of
the
can
quest
woodychandler
poured
from
a
12
oz
can
has
a
deep
brown
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
sweet
malty
taste
is
malts
molasses
a
good
bit
sweet
very
easy
drinking
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
an
enjoyable
beer
if
you
have
never
had
this
go
out
of
your
way
to
try
it
this
is
a
pretty
unusual
style
to
see
available
and
id
have
to
say
that
this
one
is
pretty
good
nice
caramel
roasted
tones
with
sweet
aspects
that
dont
overdo
it
at
all
well
rounded
and
smooth
as
much
as
can
be
for
this
style
nice
to
be
able
to
try
this
one
out
o
great
dark
ale
very
flavorful
enjoyable
and
paired
well
with
my
food
poured
a
clear
deep
amberbrown
with
a
thin
ring
of
offwhite
head
it
looks
like
a
nice
ale
not
bad
scents
of
roast
malt
toasted
malt
fruity
esters
and
some
nutty
scents
quite
nice
suggesting
a
nutty
roasty
yet
sweet
taste
flavor
of
sweet
malt
some
fruity
sweetness
a
bit
berrylike
slight
toffee
and
vague
hints
of
alcohol
with
a
faint
hint
of
roast
malt
on
the
aftertaste
its
almost
cloyingly
sweet
far
too
much
for
my
tastes
the
roast
and
nutty
scents
do
not
carry
into
the
taste
at
all
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
low
carbonation
and
a
semidrying
finish
its
quite
easy
to
drink
from
that
perspective
overall
its
not
a
bad
beer
just
a
bit
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
on
other
occasions
ive
had
this
beer
its
been
a
lot
more
roasty
and
nutty
and
i
really
enjoy
it
a
lot
when
its
like
that
it
just
seems
to
vary
from
batch
to
batch
and
this
batch
was
a
sweet
one
drinkability
pretty
good
scotch
ale
i
would
have
it
again
overall
not
too
bad
but
i
dont
feel
the
need
to
buy
it
again
overall
impression
a
very
nice
clean
scottish
ale
that
suited
the
style
well
lucky
to
have
tried
something
from
this
brewery
while
i
was
in
the
airport
during
a
layover
highly
suggest
this
beer
o
simple
yet
good
considering
everything
else
i
have
seen
readily
available
to
me
as
i
have
not
been
seeking
out
craft
bee
this
is
the
best
option
easy
to
drink
b
o
as
a
scottish
style
ale
its
kind
of
a
fail
as
there
isnt
really
much
peaty
taste
i
normally
associate
with
the
style
but
as
simply
a
beer
its
pretty
darn
good
with
no
major
flaws
bonus
point
for
being
by
far
the
best
craft
option
on
tap
at
many
a
bar
and
restaurant
in
arizona
while
on
a
work
trip
to
tempe
az
recently
we
tried
kilt
lifter
by
four
peaks
and
loved
it
kilt
lifter
goes
well
with
traditional
pub
grub
it
looks
nice
and
smell
nice
as
well
it
has
a
very
good
drinkability
i
would
order
kilt
lifter
again
in
the
future
for
a
scottish
ale
this
is
outstanding
not
exactly
my
favorite
type
of
beer
since
they
do
tend
to
be
pretty
bland
but
this
is
one
of
the
best
of
its
style
o
this
is
a
very
solid
scottish
ale
and
you
really
dont
see
too
many
of
these
on
the
market
seek
it
out
mouthfeel
is
thickish
and
slightly
sticky
overall
im
glad
i
picked
it
up
four
peaks
kiltlifter
scottish
ale
i
got
to
try
a
bottle
of
this
brew
at
a
conference
in
phoenix
deep
amber
color
thin
head
and
little
aroma
the
flavor
brings
malt
notes
to
the
fore
and
not
much
else
feels
a
little
thin
for
a
scottish
ale
this
is
a
decent
offering
to
partake
if
you
are
in
the
area
may
as
well
support
the
local
brew
it
does
not
set
the
scottish
ale
world
on
fire
however
this
one
is
all
malt
but
isnt
too
sweet
the
flavors
come
together
nicely
o
this
certainly
doesnt
lift
my
kilt
had
a
bottle
from
ajs
in
tucson
this
is
just
a
nice
clean
scottish
ale
with
mild
caramel
and
a
touch
of
roast
the
aroma
like
the
flavor
is
all
malt
but
with
more
of
a
bready
bent
to
it
the
softer
caramel
taste
rolls
over
your
tongue
with
a
lighter
carbonation
and
a
very
slight
herbal
earthy
edge
i
wouldnt
call
it
peaty
but
its
close
worth
a
try
mouthfeel
is
pretty
good
i
find
it
pretty
clean
and
crisp
probably
the
cleanest
scottish
style
ale
ive
ever
had
pretty
drinkable
overall
its
pretty
tasty
i
like
scottish
ales
and
was
happy
to
get
a
can
of
this
thanks
huadog
for
the
sweet
extra
another
great
beer
offered
at
four
peaks
it
has
a
rusty
amber
color
to
it
and
always
hits
the
spot
the
smell
is
consistent
with
an
amber
scottish
ale
and
the
taste
is
exactly
what
youd
expect
from
a
four
peaks
beer
rich
and
flavorful
and
a
bit
of
hoppiness
to
it
but
not
too
much
do
this
is
a
fairly
tame
contribution
to
the
style
notably
but
appropriately
lacking
in
hop
qualities
it
offers
a
level
of
compatibility
with
other
flavors
that
really
shouldnt
be
surprising
in
a
maltfocused
beer
of
normal
strength
overall
im
lucky
to
live
in
arizona
with
so
many
quality
beers
made
in
recent
years
this
one
is
the
four
peaks
flagship
i
think
and
deservedly
so
to
think
i
can
buy
12packs
of
this
deliciousness
at
the
quicktrip
on
the
way
home
too
hooray

it
was
a
good
beer
i
just
wish
it
ran
a
little
thicker
pours
an
transparent
amber
with
a
creamy
fingerdeep
head
minimal
lacing
carmaalsweet
odor
with
a
hint
of
hops
at
the
end
very
smooth
mouth
feel
and
easy
to
drink
alcohol
content
is
unnoticeable
under
the
sweet
caramel
taste
first
time
tasting
this
local
beer
and
wont
be
the
last
fairly
rich
and
highly
drinkable
id
call
it
more
of
an
american
amber
though
its
less
bitter
than
many
in
that
style
its
ok
on
tap
though
i
would
prefer
the
more
carbonated
bottle
version
on
tap
at
the
bass
pro
shops
restaurant
in
the
deep
suburban
expanse
of
what
might
be
scottsdale
a
ubiquitous
az
beer
that
always
hits
the
spot
pours
a
clear
amber
with
creamy
head
little
lacing
smells
is
of
sweet
caramel
and
upon
tasting
is
complimented
by
a
touch
of
hop
character
and
ends
with
some
alcohol
warmth
overall
very
smooth
drinkable
and
delicious
caramel
deep
golden
orange
in
color
clear
with
a
white
head
that
dissipated
quickly
very
nice
color
aroma
of
sweet
toasted
and
caramel
malts
the
flavor
is
very
similar
to
the
aroma
with
the
addition
of
a
subtle
smoky
flavor
four
peaks
description
of
this
kilt
lifter
is
spot
on
with
what
i
tasted
medium
bodied
with
an
effervescent
mouth
feel
it
finishes
with
some
sweet
malt
and
smokiness
very
drinkable
overall
it
was
ok
compared
to
the
rest
of
the
line
up
that
day
it
was
way
be
hind
but
on
its
own
not
bad
kiltlifter
has
floral
notes
in
the
odor
and
a
pleasant
although
misleadingly
bland
flavor
after
smelling
it
would
be
nice
if
it
had
a
bit
more
hops
in
it
and
the
carbonation
is
weak
although
adequate
i
like
this
beer
overall
but
at
7
50
usd
i
think
i
can
do
better
however
for
a
local
az
brew
it
is
not
bad
as
there
are
not
that
many
good
brews
created
here
beer
is
medium
in
body
and
has
a
nice
finish
to
it
beer
is
sweet
clean
finish
mild
graininess
through
the
beer
but
this
was
a
staple
of
mine
in
college
it
is
fun
when
a
blast
from
your
past
beer
is
seriously
drinkable
and
has
a
great
subtle
candy
toffee
flavor
that
makes
me
want
more
all
the
beers
i
grew
up
on
have
such
horrible
reviews
on
beeradvocate
people
no
longer
know
what
good
beer
tastes
like
i
am
missing
dark
malts
on
this
brew
has
a
lighter
caramely
aspect
this
is
like
an
amber
ale
with
a
british
twist
yeast
throws
off
lots
of
fruity
esters
it
is
strangely
enjoyable
though
and
easy
to
quaff
creamy
mouthfeel
is
nice
forgettable
but
certainly
not
regrettable
overall
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
taste
but
i
am
pretty
sure
this
one
is
more
spot
on
the
flavor
profile
for
its
style
than
many
of
the
east
coast
ipas
i
have
had
recently
i
mean
at
least
scotland
is
across
the
pond
and
is
excused
for
using
european
hops
and
yeasts
when
recreating
the
brew
thanks
to
spidermonkey
for
this
sample
o
meh
wasnt
the
my
favorite
i
havent
had
that
many
scottish
ales
but
can
name
several
better
than
this
the
cpj
toffee
and
caramel
malt
flavors
followed
by
a
toastybreadiness
that
matches
the
smell
plenty
of
sweetness
all
the
way
through
medium
bodied
extremely
smooth
velvety
mouthfeel
when
looking
at
it
in
the
glass
it
seems
like
medium
carbonation
but
the
cask
conditioning
is
apparent
in
the
feel
d
overall
a
delicious
thirstquenching
brew
that
would
easily
serve
as
liquid
bread
very
fullflavored
and
satisfying
but
also
accessible
to
craft
newcomers
would
i
buy
more
of
it
i
need
to
get
myself
a
mixedpack
of
four
peaks
beers
combining
this
with
their
kolsch
and
ipa
and
i
think
youve
got
the
makings
of
quite
the
weekend
d
a
pleasantthough
simplescotch
ale
maybe
not
quite
to
style
however
nothing
mind
blowing
here
but
pleasant
and
quite
drinkable
my
overall
impression
of
the
beer
was
average
but
it
had
hints
of
promise
although
not
a
traditional
scottish
style
ale
in
my
opinion
it
did
have
some
interesting
aspects
the
malts
created
some
interested
flavors
which
i
would
love
to
explore
again
this
beer
is
average
is
a
bottle
but
might
be
a
completely
different
experience
from
the
tap
feels
like
they
were
a
bit
timid
in
the
process
probably
due
to
the
proximity
to
a
college
campus
they
wanted
to
make
a
beer
with
more
mass
appeal
still
worth
a
try
a
fairly
mellow
but
solid
enough
scottish
style
ale
and
pretty
true
to
style
im
a
little
surprised
this
only
rates
a
b
perhaps
a
little
dryer
than
most
but
still
enjoyable
pours
copper
with
a
fairly
thin
head
smells
nicely
malty
and
a
little
nutty
with
the
smell
of
toasted
oats
nicely
balanced
in
the
taste
with
slightly
chewy
malt
restrained
earthy
and
spicy
hops
some
dry
graininess
on
the
finish
and
a
touch
juicy
in
the
middle
i
enjoyed
this
my
first
pint
had
a
low
level
of
acetaldehyde
which
really
put
me
off
im
not
finding
that
tonight
which
definitely
increases
my
enjoyment
of
the
beer
d
overall
this
makes
for
a
great
drinker
do
can
a
can
increase
drinkability
i
think
so
in
four
peaks
kilt
lifters
case
you
wouldnt
guess
its
6
2abv
drinks
like
a
macro
with
some
decent
flavor
pours
clear
brown
with
no
head
laces
nice
but
falls
away
quickly
smells
malty
rich
malty
and
strong
alcohol
tastes
good
with
nice
rich
malty
flavors
alcohol
that
i
smelled
is
not
so
prevelant
in
tasting
sweet
tastes
up
front
that
fall
away
to
a
dry
caramel
finish
pretty
good
for
this
style
a
little
on
the
lighter
side
than
other
styles
but
i
could
see
how
this
would
fit
right
into
the
warm
arizona
climate
down
here

d
im
not
sure
ive
ever
done
more
than
one
but
so
many
people
i
know
drink
this
all
the
time
that
i
have
to
yield
to
them
on
this
one
of
the
better
local
arizona
beers
this
is
a
great
beer
i
had
a
pitcher
at
the
brewery
it
went
very
well
with
my
dinner
it
pours
a
nice
golden
amber
color
the
aroma
is
delicious
and
smelled
fresh
obviously
brewed
wih
clean
and
clear
water
the
carbonation
was
average
and
the
taste
a
bit
sweet
which
left
a
nice
aftertaste
on
my
pallette
a
very
good
beer
indeed
definitely
one
of
the
better
local
az
beers
i
have
had
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
solid
and
easydrinking
beer
for
the
style
but
its
nothing
for
which
id
clamor
to
have
again
worth
a
shot
to
see
for
yourself
d
easy
to
drink
and
really
enjoyed
being
able
to
try
this
several
times
d
easy
to
drink
the
exact
opposite
of
hoppiness
this
is
pretty
inoffensive
it
seems
accessible
to
nonbeer
geeks
there
could
be
a
lot
more
going
on
with
the
style
and
even
with
this
beer
it
seems
like
they
used
plenty
of
malt
but
it
just
didnt
shape
up
d
this
was
above
my
expectations
it
was
a
beer
you
could
drink
maybe
not
session
but
more
than
just
sip
or
sample
i
had
a
couple
cans
and
liked
it
more
on
the
second
can
than
the
first
it
would
pair
well
with
bbq
the
kiltlifter
was
a
dark
carmel
in
color
with
a
small
to
non
existent
head
but
there
was
plenty
of
carbonation
in
the
flavor
flavor
had
a
combination
of
light
smoke
dark
malt
subtle
hops
in
general
very
well
balanced
overall
this
is
a
very
good
scottish
and
was
my
beer
of
choice
even
over
some
less
interesting
pale
ales
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
the
color
is
a
moderate
brown
with
a
bit
of
slight
haze
the
nose
is
some
light
caramel
toffee
bread
and
hints
of
dark
fruits
the
taste
is
along
similar
lines
with
a
bit
of
brown
sugar
and
molasses
light
date
flavors
and
caramel
good
body
and
everything
lends
well
to
the
flavor
drinks
pretty
well
but
nothing
too
special
about
it
nice
very
easy
drinking
once
in
my
mouth
this
scottishstyle
ale
attempted
to
make
up
for
the
lack
of
nose
by
warming
my
entire
body
after
each
sip
so
this
is
what
6
abv
feels
like
i
dig
it
after
my
initial
surprise
at
the
quick
warmth
spreading
through
my
chest
i
found
i
enjoyed
the
light
body
with
lots
of
carbonation
doubled
with
a
spiciness
that
snagged
at
my
taste
buds
with
each
swallow
it
did
end
a
little
dryer
than
i
would
have
liked
but
it
also
cut
back
on
any
aftertaste
which
is
always
fine
with
me
i
dont
know
why
but
i
just
cant
seem
to
handle
aftertastes
well
the
pleasant
spice
was
dutifully
accommodated
by
a
smooth
swish
of
caramel
smoky
malt
and
that
unnameable
fruit
not
too
bad
overall
i
wouldnt
seek
this
out
or
even
purchase
again
if
i
had
the
chance
just
ok
drinks
like
a
classic
this
ones
four
peaks
best
seller
and
its
easy
to
see
why
a
little
light
on
flavor
but
eminently
drinkable
noticably
more
enjoyable
tonight
than
what
i
remembered
i
say
go
for
it
brown
with
copper
highlights
minimal
head
and
lace
slightly
sweet
smelling
malts
and
a
bit
of
flowery
honey
taste
has
the
same
malty
sweetness
not
much
hops
pretty
decent
for
the
style
tastey
brew
worth
having
another
always
will
support
a
local
brew
if
i
have
the
option
d
a
real
nice
little
beer
malty
and
delicious
this
is
as
common
as
bmc
in
the
phoenix
metro
area
and
clearly
superior
drinkability
good
beer
with
a
good
balance
i
could
see
myself
coming
back
to
this
one
a
few
times
drinkability
this
is
the
reason
why
youll
drink
this
beer
you
can
easily
drink
3
or
4
a
solid
flagship
offering
even
if
a
bit
thin
for
the
style
reminds
me
of
some
nice
ambers
with
a
dash
of
smokyness
seems
pretty
spot
on
for
a
lighter
version
of
the
style
which
is
welcomed
by
me
as
i
am
not
big
on
scottish
ales
im
liking
this
one
more
and
more
as
i
drink
them
the
first
one
didnt
impress
me
too
much
pours
a
light
orange
with
about
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
sweet
malt
and
a
hint
of
hops
like
i
said
the
first
one
didnt
impress
me
but
im
really
partial
to
darker
stouts
and
porters
this
one
took
a
bit
of
getting
used
to
but
im
really
starting
to
enjoy
it
the
flavor
is
a
really
sweet
malty
bready
flavor
a
hint
of
bitterness
which
i
take
for
the
6
alcohol
it
also
has
a
really
subtle
smokey
flavor
which
i
think
must
be
the
peat
that
people
have
mentioned
it
has
a
fairly
large
amount
of
carbonation
but
i
think
it
fits
this
one
im
enjoying
it
and
if
its
still
early
ill
have
another
i
work
tomorrow
overall
this
is
a
solid
beer
with
good
components
but
nothing
that
really
stands
out
in
particular
just
a
bit
above
average
pours
a
transparent
orange
brown
color
with
a
small
white
head
that
quickly
dissipates
to
nothing
more
than
a
fine
ring
along
the
edge
of
the
glass
sweet
caramel
malt
and
possibly
cherry
in
the
nose
coating
and
sweet
but
not
to
the
point
of
annoyance
a
good
and
balanced
american
made
interpretation
of
the
style
a
slight
sour
twang
late
on
the
finish
is
my
only
complaint
and
its
a
small
one
at
that
d
had
some
trouble
finishing
this
brew
if
it
were
not
for
some
roasted
penuts
on
the
side
maltiness
with
some
yeast
tired
me
out
drinkability
jorge
hyped
this
one
up
quite
a
bit
and
while
it
didnt
live
up
to
that
hype
this
was
still
an
enjoyable
experience
if
i
lived
in
arizona
id
happily
buy
six
packs
of
this
to
support
the
local
economy
notes
this
is
not
the
best
example
of
a
scottish
ale
but
certainly
popular
with
the
locals
and
is
a
great
gateway
beer
for
the
masses
still
ill
have
some
from
the
tap
at
four
peaks
next
time
im
in
arizona
the
beer
pours
orange
copper
with
a
large
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
very
sweet
with
some
caramel
and
apple
notes
the
flavor
is
caramel
apple
sweet
malt
and
some
other
fruits
including
cherry
no
real
smoke
or
peat
character
medium
mouthfeel
and
carbonation
enjoyed
at
the
scottsdale
location
brewed
of
course
at
tempe
brewpub
their
very
popular
but
merely
serviceable
beer
has
a
dark
yellow
coloured
body
and
a
white
head
with
white
lace
their
is
light
smoke
in
the
aroma
and
more
in
the
taste
average
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
overall
a
good
example
of
the
style
with
no
major
flaws
but
not
outstanding
worth
the
money
and
the
time
but
not
a
beer
i
would
seek
out
again
i
am
drinking
it
with
a
fluffy
and
wholesome
piece
of
bread
spread
with
butter
a
good
combination
d
a
drinkable
beer
which
is
important
to
success
in
a
college
town
where
kids
expect
to
quaff
rather
than
appreciate
this
beer
definitely
reflects
a
house
flavor
though
which
is
generally
subtle
but
inoffensive
im
drinking
it
now
because
i
bought
it
but
i
long
for
a
belhaven
the
bartender
poured
this
one
into
a
glass
for
me
and
it
was
a
nice
rich
caramel
color
but
no
head
to
speak
of
smelled
of
malt
and
caramel
and
thats
pretty
much
what
it
tasted
like
with
some
butterscotch
thrown
in
a
pleasant
flavor
even
if
this
isnt
my
favorite
style
fairly
drinkable
though
i
dont
think
id
have
more
than
two
this
beer
is
not
very
enjoyable
and
sadly
its
par
for
the
course
when
it
come
to
arizona
microbrews
a
good
scottish
ale
deserves
more
flavor
while
this
brew
has
been
made
for
the
masses
i
would
like
to
buy
more
local
beers
but
beers
like
this
remind
me
of
why
i
have
to
look
elsewhere
d
okay
could
use
some
more
carbonation
and
would
taste
a
bit
better
without
the
medicine
like
component
just
okay
overall
serves
a
nice
red
amber
without
much
of
a
head
but
minimal
lacing
not
much
in
the
way
of
aroma
maybe
a
hint
of
malt
and
subdued
hops
but
nothing
stands
out
taste
on
par
with
the
smell
subtle
malty
notes
and
just
the
faintest
whisper
of
hop
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
kinda
thin
and
unsubstantial
but
drinkability
is
great
i
could
see
myself
throwing
back
a
few
of
these
if
it
was
the
only
decent
brew
on
tap
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
my
shaker
pint
glass
appears
a
clear
rich
amber
color
with
about
a
finger
of
tight
off
white
foam
no
lacing
to
mention
smells
and
tastes
of
medium
toasted
grain
nice
and
malty
with
a
good
amount
of
caramel
mild
smokiness
and
biscuits
medium
in
both
body
and
carbonation
glad
to
have
had
the
chance
to
try
this
one
calor
is
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
small
off
white
beige
colored
hear
good
lacing
aroma
is
all
caramel
malt
with
just
a
touch
of
smokiness
no
hop
aroma
flavor
is
also
that
of
caramel
malt
and
a
little
bit
on
the
sweet
side
could
use
a
little
bit
more
hop
bitterness
to
balance
the
beer
medium
bodied
with
good
carbonation
not
the
best
four
peaks
beer
but
not
the
worst
either
drinkability
was
good
and
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
a
nice
beer
d
to
me
this
is
an
ok
beer
the
style
isnt
my
favorite
but
compared
the
the
other
beers
from
the
style
ive
had
this
doesnt
fit
too
well
with
them
try
it
if
you
want
all
in
all
if
im
eating
a
nice
greasy
dinner
and
theres
not
a
lot
of
variety
on
tap
this
is
a
decent
choice
d
not
a

its

more

an

followed
by
some

is
a

lively
at

it

down
to
be

slightly
uncomplex
and
all
around
an
average
experience
kiltlifter
tasted
more
like
a
maibock
than
anything
ive
had
out
of
scotland
lately
id
drink
this
beer
again
if
i
were
in
arizona
letting
you
know
that
this
is
a
scottish
ale
the
flavor
is
more
impressive
light
brown
copper
with
big
tan
head
aroma
is
lightly
roasted
malt
and
some
brown
sugar
body
is
light
very
light
caramel
sweetness
slightly
acidic
hop
flavor
at
the
end
like
an
apple
pie
without
the
apple
pie
spices
overall
damn
good
beer
tons
of
malt
which
im
a
big
fan
of
malt
fans
will
love
this
beer
id
certainly
get
it
again
poured
a
reddish
brown
body
with
an
aroma
that
was
rather
lowkey
and
somewhat
disappointing
with
minimal
sweet
and
bread
malts
and
hardly
any
dark
fruits
at
all
beer
is
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
light
bodied
for
style
like
the
hop
crispness
on
backend
and
this
beer
isnt
bad
but
it
isnt
great
either
has
a
little
bit
of
sweet
malt
and
dark
fruit
taste
but
for
most
part
they
are
subdued
flavors
that
dont
really
grab
my
attention
o
port
citys
beers
barring
their
damn
good
porter
always
seem
to
be
somewhat
forgettable
theres
nothing
wrong
with
any
of
them
theyre
just
usually
devoid
of
excitement
this
is
much
of
the
same
its
a
decent
brew
but
a
bit
dull
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
personally
poured
a
cloudy
deep
brown
with
reddish
tint
theres
about
a
finger
of
creamy
light
tan
head
that
doesnt
last
too
long
but
does
linger
on
and
leaves
a
wee
bit
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
pretty
mild
with
just
some
slight
malt
hints
but
nothing
definitive
the
flavor
makes
up
for
it
though
theres
a
robust
roasted
malt
flavor
with
some
nice
dark
caramel
and
little
earthy
hops
on
the
finish
its
got
a
nice
full
fulling
on
the
palate
and
a
little
bit
of
carbonation
overall
a
good
to
very
good
scottish
ale
i
really
like
this
ale
full
malty
flavor
with
so
many
breweries
throwing
in
hops
its
nice
to
have
a
great
tasting
beer
which
quenches
the
thirst
with
some
great
beer
flavor
though
the
hops
are
ever
so
alightly
sensed
on
the
nose
you
dont
really
catch
them
on
the
tongue
this
would
pare
well
with
a
good
burger
brewer
says
this
is
made
with
five
malts
and
fuggles
hops
and
rates
the
ibus
at
24
on
tap
at
the
brewery
on
the
outskirts
of
alexandria
o
not
overly
complex
but
a
very
nice
tasty
scottish
ale
a
growing
favorite
style
of
mine
i
definitely
enjoyed
this
and
could
easily
session
it
not
a
terrible
beer
but
definately
my
least
favourite
of
port
citys
beers
o
this
beer
is
a
pretty
solid
seasonal
offering
from
port
city
the
flavor
was
pretty
enjoyable
containing
a
good
level
of
sweetness
that
didnt
reach
the
point
of
being
cloying
while
this
probably
isnt
a
musthave
for
me
i
do
appreciate
trying
new
virginia
seasonal
brews
especially
in
a
style
thats
less
prevalent
like
this
offering
o
the
tartan
ale
is
another
solid
offering
from
port
city
a
great
very
drinkable
offering
that
most
everyone
should
enjoy
overall
though
highly
drinkable
and
worth
trying
certainly
can
enjoy
it
beer
is
medium
in
body
and
sweet
subtle
flavors
and
that
is
to
say
not
many
flavors
at
all
not
a
great
beer
but
it
was
drinkable
i
wont
have
it
again
o
overall
a
decent
beer
from
port
city
not
my
favorite
of
their
seasonals
as
i
found
the
nose
a
bit
bland
but
the
taste
made
up
for
it
nice
fruity
taste
probably
wouldnt
pick
up
a
6er
of
this
one
but
worth
checking
out
once
or
twice
id
rank
this
slightly
below
tidings
in
terms
of
liking
their
seasonal
beers
with
their
oktoberfest
being
the
best
by
far
d
a
wellmade
scottish
ale
from
port
city
the
minor
smokey
notes
add
an
appreciated
layer
of
complexity
certainly
worth
trying
o
a
pretty
decent
little
ale
port
city
is
really
coming
around
with
their
seasonal
line
up
an
above
average
session
beer
for
the
malt
men
and
ladies
out
there
itd
be
a
treat
to
share
this
with
friends
on
a
lazy
spring
afternoon
o
a
decent
scottish
ale
here
very
lightdrinking
for
the
style
but
the
malt
profile
could
use
a
little
bit
more
depth
and
complexity
definitely
one
to
try
but
not
one
i
would
want
to
have
multiples
of
in
a
sitting
this
would
be
a
great
sixpack
to
bring
along
to
a
party
where
you
are
looking
to
introduce
folks
to
craft
beer
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
is
a
great
balance
of
scotchale
flavor
with
lightness
of
feel
o
while
i
probably
wont
be
running
down
the
road
to
alexandria
to
get
any
growler
fills
of
this
stuff
i
could
easily
pop
a
couple
of
these
this
was
a
scottish
ale
to
my
liking
best
scottish
ale
i
have
had
and
i
have
tried
many
full
flavor
not
bitter
and
a
taste
that
lingers
on
the
tongue
perfectly
very
slight
nuttiness
great
with
a
hearty
meal
or
even
better
all
by
itself
strong
recommendation
o
nothing
too
outstanding
here
but
thats
where
it
shines
very
smooth
and
easy
while
still
having
some
complexity
to
it
i
like
robert
the
bruce
best
scottish
ale
that
i
have
had
so
far
interesting
in
a
category
all
its
own
it
was
ok
but
not
great
the
taste
was
not
that
memorable
but
this
is
a
good
easy
to
drink
scottish
ale
i
lucked
out
and
got
the
last
6er
from
the
local
beer
store
tonight
and
damn
i
can
see
why
this
stuff
sells
out
so
fast
its
smooth
its
tasty
and
you
get
six
not
just
a
bomber
ill
be
picking
this
up
every
chance
i
get
one
of
my
new
favorites
my
first
three
floyds
experience
i
realize
this
one
doesnt
garner
the
hype
like
the
rest
of
their
lineup
but
nevertheless
this
didnt
disappoint
almost
sessionable
due
to
its
light
nature
if
you
like
malty
beers
then
give
this
a
try
i
could
easily
enjoy
a
couple
of
these
at
the
pub
overall
drinkability
easily
could
drink
more
tasty
but
not
overpowering
or
really
strong
in
flavor
a
finely
balanced
scotch
ale
that
goes
really
well
with
food
gyro
pizza
in
this
case
and
i
think
would
be
really
good
all
on
its
own
ill
have
to
try
to
get
back
to
south
park
tavern
next
time
they
have
it
on
tap
and
i
dont
have
to
get
back
to
work
right
away
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
styles
but
unfortunately
not
a
lot
of
brewers
are
making
it
this
is
beer
is
so
deliciously
malty
with
the
smokey
peat
you
expect
from
the
style
and
hints
of
caramel
and
toffee
i
love
scotch
ales
and
to
me
this
rides
the
difference
between
the
lighter
scottish
ales
90
schilling
laughing
lab
and
wee
mac
and
the
bigger
scotch
ales
out
there
old
chub
claymore
and
wee
muckle
it
is
an
easy
drinking
sweet
malty
delight
great
gateway
into
the
bigger
but
less
made
malty
beers
i
think
3floyds
kills
it
in
every
style
they
try
nice
flavor
that
is
very
drinkable
o
4

one
of
the
best
standard
scotch
ales
that
ive
ever
had
highly
recommended
excellent
smooth
wonderful
tasting
brew
from
three
floyds
it
is
one
of
the
best
beers
that
i
have
tried
overall
i
highly
recommend
it
if
you
can
get
your
hands
on
it
as
it
can
be
quite
hard
to
get
from
what
my
local
beverage
store
said
worth
the
price
but
it
is
fairly
expensive
keep
in
mind
you
are
getting
a
high
quality
beer
this
is
fff
most
underrated
beer
i
love
scottish
ales
so
theres
that
too
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
but
i
prefer
weemac
from
sunking
a
bit
more
this
is
a
very
balanced
easy
to
drink
scottish
ale
f
nice
carbonation
on
the
high
medium
end
some
good
viscosity
o
not
my
favorite
scottish
ale
overall
offers
a
very
enjoyable
complex
palate
overall
this
seems
to
ride
the
line
between
an
80
and
90
shilling
its
richly
malted
and
quite
drinkable
considering
its
6
5
abv
though
avoids
becoming
cloying
its
an
excellent
attempt
but
doesnt
quite
match
the
better
scottish
distilleries
still
a
pleasant
and
enjoyable
beer
odecent
beer
for
its
intended
style
i
was
honestly
expecting
more
but
pleased
nonetheless
overall
i
really
liked
this
one
i
just
kinda
discovered
english
milds
and
scottish
ales
this
year
i
found
one
locally
that
i
really
enjoy
and
this
one
is
better
i
wish
i
had
more
than
a
6
pack
outstanding
winter
favorite
smooth
as
silk
with
a
chocolate
finish
real
nice
scottish
ale
monster
malt
bill
has
an
almost
chocolateymalt
ball
taste
could
almost
be
confused
with
a
light
porter
or
possibly
a
bock
if
i
didnt
know
better
its
a
deep
red
the
color
is
really
beautiful
leaves
a
faint
after
taste
maybe
tobacco
i
can
only
compare
this
to
founders
dirty
bastard
i
will
say
founders
has
a
bit
more
full
high
octane
feel
maybe
more
balanced
and
smoother
this
is
ever
so
slightly
more
watery
however
this
is
very
drinkable
and
has
good
medium
body
sneaky
brew
great
taste
lots
of
flavors
it
packs
a
punch
but
doesnt
seem
strong
its
my
new
favorite
i
order
it
every
time
i
find
it
on
tap
poured
from
bottle
color
is
a
deep
rich
red
mahogany
just
gorgeous
nearly
fully
opaque
smell
is
candied
yams
and
caramel
taste
was
impressively
balanced
there
is
a
little
sweetness
but
never
cloying
lots
of
caramel
flavors
some
dark
raisiny
fruit
coming
through
as
well
mouthfeel
was
very
full
rich
and
round
the
carbonation
is
light
but
it
suits
the
style
just
a
delicious
scotch
ale
a
middle
of
the
road
brew
that
is
well
made
but
i
dont
feel
a
desire
to
return
to
it
overall
a
pretty
solid
malty
scottish
ale
solid
toasty
malt
notes
with
some
nice
creamy
smoothness
not
bad
had
better
scottish
style
beers
but
this
one
does
good
in
a
pinch
dark
brown
reddish
tiny
taste
is
caramel
raisin
vanilla
overall
this
one
is
good
great
stuff
serving
type
bottle
o
not
even
close
to
my
favorite
from
three
floyds
or
even
a
scottish
ale
for
that
matter
not
bad
but
not
great
either
o
very
good
top
notch
for
the
style
toasted
brown
malts
lead
to
a
semidecadent
satisfying
experience
especially
along
side
a
massive
burger
at
kumas
great
job
making
a
less
popular
style
by
fff
overall
well
brewed
example
of
a
80
schilling
nothing
stands
out
here
though
as
special
the
sulfur
in
aroma
really
detracts
from
the
overall
beer
i
wont
go
back
to
it
but
it
does
hide
its
alcohol
well
overall
enjoyed
this
one
o
this
is
a
good
beer
but
not
great
for
the
style
the
slight
twist
on
the
flavor
profile
is
welcome
but
the
strong
carbonation
distracts
from
this
if
you
like
the
scottish
style
ales
this
is
one
for
you
a
true
beauty
on
the
malt
bill
and
while
not
as
complex
as
some
of
the
other
three
floods
beers
it
certainly
exudes
the
same
high
quality
and
attention
to
detail
as
the
others
dark
caramel
in
color
with
a
nose
that
smells
like
caramel
in
the
works
sugar
melting
into
butter
with
just
a
slight
burning
toast
character
not
much
more
than
a
quarter
inch
of
tan
foam
on
it
the
flavor
is
awesome
and
it
comes
in
layers
with
the
sweet
part
of
the
malt
coming
and
going
quickly
with
a
saint
brown
sugar
flavor
but
it
moves
into
a
richer
more
bready
almost
german
malt
complexion
with
maybe
the
faintest
hint
of
smoke
as
it
finishes
rich
is
the
best
way
to
describe
it
but
not
decadent
just
full
flavored
and
even
fuller
bodied
i
find
it
remarkably
drinkable
nevertheless
and
enjoy
the
punctuating
carbonation
one
of
those
beers
that
wins
awards
because
its
well
done
and
real
true
to
style
i
love
the
grain
flavors
on
this
its
different
than
most
with
even
a
hint
of
maple
or
honey
as
it
goes
down
i
like
this
a
lot
in
fall
weather
but
it
works
here
in
early
summer
too
especially
in
a
morning
drinking
context
especially
because
the
alcohol
isnt
stupidly
high
for
no
reason
i
could
have
multiples
of
this
no
problem
dark
mahogany
color
with
a
quarter

the

this
is
a
very
subtle
beer
and
i
really
like
the
aroma
great
example
of
a
well
executed
scotch
ale
havent
had
one
of
these
in
a
while
and
it
sure
hit
the
spot
overall
this
is
just
a
mediocre
offering
from
three
floyds
they
should
probably
stick
with
standard
pales
and
ipas
beerandwhiskeyhq
com
o
a
fine
fine
brew
this
is
perhaps
the
most
underappreciated
of
three
floyds
yearround
beers
i
need
to
buy
this
more
overall
im
not
a
scotch
ale
fan
but
this
is
probably
the
best
one
i
have
had
no
bitter
or
unpleasant
flavors
well
balanced
and
clean
poured
a
12

is
full

tons

some

small

overall
this
isnt
my

but
it
is
very
good
very

great
balance
of

and

traditional
fff
hop
excessiveness
in
a
good

some
dark

very
drinkable
not
the
hallmark
beer
of
fff
it
worth
trying
for
sure
good
overall
bottle
of
scot
i
enjoy
it
and
glad
i
can
get
it
thats
it
really
i
have
to
leave
250
word
comment
on
this
beer
ok
i
rank
it
up
there
with
one
of
my
favorite
scots
good
stuff
buy
it
if
you
can
ok
not
enough
bs
come
on
guys
its
really
good
its
three
floyds
what
do
you
expect
o
this
is
a
smooth
drinking
scotch
ale
malt
fans
will
really
enjoy
this
one
o
a
very
solid
interpretation
of
the
style
perhaps
just
a
bit
more
hoppy
than
average
but
all
marks
are
hit
a
quietly
enjoyable
beer
to
drink
o
it
is
a
well
balanced
beer
with
flavors
that
work
well
with
each
other
and
it
also
goes
down
very
smooth
o
lots
of
malt
in
this
flavorful
scottish
ale
overall
not
bad
not
as
over
the
top
as
what
3
floyds
usually
does
a
safer
milder
and
easy
drinker
worth
the
drink
if
your
a
scotch
ale
fan
or
looking
for
something
heavy
on
the
malts
serving
type

overall
a
decent
scotch
style
ale
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
though
orich
malt
bomb
with
some
nice
smokiness
and
a
little
sweetness
easy
to
drink
with
low

all
around
good

and
very

a
very
enjoyable

overall
this
is
a

for

a
fantastic
beer
for
a
nice
fall
or
winter
day
lots
of
sweet
sugary
taste
with
a
nice
brown
bread
flavor
this
is
a
very
nice
scottish
ale
its
well
crafted
and
a
good
example
of
the
style
its
worth
checking
out
if
given
the
opportunity
would
recommend
oone
of
my
favorite
scotch
ales
ever
so
far
its
pretty
much
what
got
my
excited
about
craft
beers
and
is
still
one
of
my
favorites
today
picked
up
a
6er
from
the
brew
pub
maybe
an
hour
ago
enjoyed
from
beer
hunter
taster
glass
brew
poured
a
chestnut
purple
with
a
massive
head
truth
be
told
the
bottle
got
shook
up
quite
a
bit
on
the
journey
from
the
car
as
the
head
dissipated
left
nice
lacing
nose
is
nutty
and
brown
sugar
with
very
earthy
malt
taste
is
really
nice
but
more
of
a
brown
ale
than
a
scottish
ale
tasty
but
missing
something
for
a
wee
heavy
big
brown
sugar
notes
and
earthiness
some
dark
fruit
medium
bodied
definitely
a
scotch
ale
but
tows
the
line
of
a
brown
ale
glad
to
have
a
6er
and
really
diggin
this
one
but
not
a
classic
wee
heavy
this
brew
has
plenty
of
pop
and
character
but
it
never
quite
comes
together
for
me
in
the
way
id
like
especially
considering
the
promise
suggested
by
the
aroma
its
flavorful
and
intriguing
albeit
a
little
heavy
handed
and
the
alcohol
is
distracting
then
again
three
floyds
were
never
much
for
subtlety
this
is
worth
trying
but
not
something
id
seek
out
o
a
malt
lovers
beer
packed
with
caramel
bready
and
toasted
malt
flavors
amazing
mouthfeel
to
compliment
the
flavors
a
style
i
should
explore
more
of
beer
is
mediumheavy
in
body
with
carbonation
of
mediumlow
intensity
resulting
in
a
foamy
25
and
smooth
35
mouthfeel
that
seems
fitting
for
the
beer
and
the
style
no
impression
of
ethanol
on
throat
or
in
nostrils
closes
dry
with
moderate
stickiness
clinging
to
the
palate
the
beer
pours
a
nice
dark
and
syrupy
rubybrown
with
a
little
head
of
miniscule
light
tan
bubbles
that
fizzle
away
to
the
smallest
of
rings
around
the
glass
in
body
the
beer
is
clean
of
particles
but
dark
and
a
little
murky
like
looking
through
a
bottle
of
aunt
jemimas
syrup
on
the
nose
the
beer
smells
richly
of
bready
malts
brown
sugarcoated
raisins
mingle
with
soft
peat
smoke
and
light
bacon
scents
atop
the
rich
caramel
bread
smell
which
gives
this
beers
nose
a
backbone
there
is
a
light
touch
of
sweet
alcohol
and
definite
rich
biscuit
chocolate
and
bread
notes
as
the
beer
warms
on
the
tongue
this
beer
tastes
richly
sweet
with
malts
the
beer
finds
balance
through
light
bitter
roast
and
light
savory
bacon
flavors
from
the
smoked
malt
eversosoft
herbal
hops
also
gently
bitter
the
tongue
beneath
all
of
the
other
tastes
while
slightly
cloying
alcohol
does
touch
on
the
middle
of
the
sip
on
the
tongue
the
beer
feels
medium
in
body
with
a
lightly
chewy
yet
velvety
mouthfeel
and
a
very
soft
carbonation
and
prickle
on
the
tongue
as
the
beer
warms
the
mouthfeel
seems
to
thin
out
a
little
which
is
too
bad
the
flavor
begins
as
sweet
raisins
and
light
bacon
and
peat
smoke
slowly
moving
slightly
towards
a
ciderlike
flavor
and
then
swiftly
to
warm
caramel
bread
with
a
touch
of
cola
faint
herbal
bitterness
can
be
sensed
throughout
the
sip
and
the
beer
finishes
with
a
nice
long
touch
of
baconlike
flavors
and
a
touch
of
chocolate
and
bread
the
aftertaste
lingers
with
smoke
and
caramel
sweetness
while
the
tongue
feels
oddly
scraped
and
dry
slight
maple
syrup
flavors
can
also
be
sensed
overall
this
is
a
nice
beer
with
great
malty
complexity
and
a
terrific
transition
of
flavor
as
the
beer
warms
the
closer
you
get
to
room
temperature
the
more
maple
syrup
notes
you
get
from
the
malt
but
you
also
get
a
touch
more
the
herbal
hops
a
beer
to
try
for
sure
pours
a
seethrough
reddishbrown
with
little
head
and
very
little
lacing
aromas
of
cocoa
powder
and
caramel
waft
from
the
glass
nice
pleasant
roasted
malt
hits
the
palate
first
sweet
with
a
hint
of
smokiness
that
ends
a
bit
dry
very
smooth
medium
bodied
with
light
carbonation
overall
this
is
an
extremely
well
crafted
beer
very
drinkable
for
a
beer
of
9
abv
o
a
really
nicely
balanced
brew
and
highly
drinkable
for
the
style
the
nose
and
body
are
a
bit
lacking
the
whole
though
is
greater
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
and
the
bruce
finishs
strong
for
me
dark
redbrown
pour
with
a
thick
off
white
foamy
head
i
must
say
three
floyds
beer
never
disappoints
in
the
looks
dept
aroma
is
filled
with
dark
roasted
toffee
mostly
figs
and
plum
lots
of
caramel
in
their
too
hints
of
citrus
as
well
taste
is
smooth
with
the
toffee
and
sweet
caramel
combining
very
nicely
and
even
hints
of
a
orange
note
and
also
some
butterscotch
mouth
feel
is
medium
bodied
lower
abv
make
this
one
a
easy
drinker
i
think
this
scotch
ale
can
stand
up
to
most
of
the
other
ones
on
the
market
im
glad
more
and
more
three
floyds
is
making
its
way
to
ohio
i
have
a
feeling
that
our
dreams
might
come
true
and
get
full
distribution
sooner
than
later
o
quite
nice
and
highly
drinkable
but
lacks
the
boldness
and
complexity
of
a
world
class
version
like
skullsplitter
o
malt
forward
flavorful
scottish
ale
i
think
this
beer
is
overlooked
from
the
3floyds
regulars
since
its
not
hop
forward
is
a
shame
a
sham
drink
it
love
it
repeat
overall
this
is
good
but
can
be
somewhat
cloying
went
well
with
a
burger
at
the
brewpub
but
on
its
own
is
somewhat
overwhelming
o
very
great
beer
its
a
good
break
from
fffs
hopforward
beers
o
really
great
beer
fff
knows
how
to
make
a
balanced
beer
in
whatever
style
overall
i
really
like
this
beer
and
wish
that
i
could
find
a
ba
version
i
have
only
had
a
few
scotch
ales
but
this
is
right
at
the
top
i
wish
that
i
would
have
picked
up
more
and
will
next
time
that
i
am
in
chicago
outstanding
rich
mediumfull
bodied
mouthfeel
that
pushes
all
the
way
back
across
the
palate
the
beer
has
so
much
richness
that
it
feels
almost
offdry
although
it
is
very
clean
really
a
wonderful
sense
of
balance
in
this
beer
great
job
with
the
american
version
of
this
style
the
label
says
scottish
style
ale
rather
than
straightup
scottish
ale
and
thats
what
this
is
and
a
damn
fine
one
overall
not
had
many
scottish
ales
for
comparison
different
pace
from
my
string
of
ipas
pleasantly
surprised
serving
type
bottle
overall
probably
a
below
average
scotch
ale
not
the
complexity
or
darkness
i
look
for
the
aftertaste
is
forgettable
and
leaves
something
to
be
desired
a
unique
twist
for
a
scotch
ale
more
sure
o
fairly
simple
flavors
but
well
balanced
and
quite
tasty
not
fantastic
but
nothing
to
scoff
at
either
o
i
like
tyhe
style
i
like
this
take
on
it
a
solid
offering
of
fff
although
gets
way
too
sweet
even
with
the
finer
fruity
and
malty
textures
that
it
has
to
offer
i
havent
had
too
many
scotch
or
scottish
ales
from
the
midwest
other
that
founders
dirty
bastard
and
maybe
one
or
two
more
but
its
definitely
a
region
that
makes
them
the
right
way
and
i
think
because
the
hoppiness
is
pungent
and
earthy
enough
to
round
up
the
assertive
malt
bold
properties
while
i
could
do
without
the
excessive
sweetened
boozy
finish
i
could
definitely
have
this
again
pairs
very
well
with
all
kinds
of
food
recommended
for
fans
of
fff
good
depth
moderate
carbonation
slightly
syrupy
going
down
a
maltlovers
dream
no
doubt
this
beer
is
malty
to
the
max
caramel
toffee
mild
pale
fruits
sweettea
like
finish
a
treat
of
a
beer
not
a
style
i
visit
often
but
this
reminds
me
why
i
should
revisit
this
time
and
again
a
nice
beer
here
this
is
a
nice
scotch
style
ale
but
its
not
mindblowing
the
sweeter
notes
blend
perfectly
with
the
bitter
hops
and
slight
smoke
and
it
makes
for
a
very
nice
and
easy
drinking
beer
its
a
good
and
solid
example
of
this
style
but
nothing
to
get
too
excited
over
this
is
a
nice
simple
ale
its
brewed
to
style
and
has
an
enjoyable
highly
drinkable
flavor
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
tamer
three
floyds
offerings
that
i
have
had
but
it
is
still
worth
a
try
pretty
solid
stuff
good
looking
tan
fizzy
head
deep
red
in
color
on
the
sweeter
side
for
an
already
sweet
style
tons
of
sugary
toasted
malt
some
bready
yeasty
flavors
and
of
course
biscuit
can
be
a
bit
cloying
and
heavy
at
times
but
it
has
its
own
twist
and
unique
character
dark
sugary
fruits
an
enjoyable
beer
but
one
is
enough
for
me
almost
like
a
dark
real
kola
drink
overall
the
thing
we
liked
best
about
this
beer
was
its
complexity
the
flavoring
remained
nicely
fruity
and
sweet
spicing
things
up
stylistically
while
the
malts
took
a
back
seat
until
thoroughly
warmed
soy
sauce
saltiness
and
pale
honey
sweetness
helped
keep
things
a
bit
more
serious
but
the
residual
sugars
did
become
a
bit
much
by
the
end
the
nose
felt
comparatively
cheaper
and
thinned
through
this
beer
drinks
decently
but
never
quite
melds
as
much
as
you
want
it
too
while
i
definitely
bled
with
william
wallace
im
still
not
sure
if
i
will
bleed
with
robert
the
bruce
o
definitely
try
this
if
you
enjoy
scottishwee
heavy
ales
but
personally
i
prefer
the
pipeworks
last
kiss
and
the
founders
dirty
bastard
o
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
to
sip
on
a
good
cold
night
sitting
back
and
enjoying
a
great
movie
with
your
slippers
and
a
hot
roaring
fire
is
what
this
beer
is
made
for
o
this
surprised
me
for
some
reason
my
expectations
were
lower
i
guess
love
the
look
of
this
scottish
ale
o
fits
style
but
nose
and
taste
are
average
and
i
didnt
care
for
the
carmel
earthy
roastiness
taste
froth
level
is
very
nice
tho
overall
another
solid
brew
by
three
floyds
the
first
beer
by
them
that
i
have
rated
above
above
average
but
they
have
all
been
good
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
well
done
and
drinkable
certainly
worth
a
try
if
you
can
get
your
hands
on
it
solid
offering
for
the
style
loved
the
intense
maltiness
overall
a
nice
easy
drinking
beer
especially
at
6
5
abv
most
of
the
time
i
prefer
something
a
little
hoppier
but
this
is
still
a
quality
brew
that
ill
drink
on
the
occasion
that
im
craving
a
crisp
malty
ale
not
bad
but
this
seems
to
fall
short
of
my
prefered
examples
of
the
style
and
isnt
among
three
floyds
stronger
work
its
easy
to
drink
and
is
a
nice
little
pause
from
my
usual
stouts
ad
ipas
o
nice
solid
effort
didnt
love
it
but
would
certainly
have
again
i
always
enjoy
a
malt
driven
beer
that
isnt
overly
cloying
with
its
sweetness
lots
of
depth
enjoy
six
pack
of
this
scottish
ale
from
3
floyds
while
watching
braveheart
o
i
know
of
lots
of
people
that
really
dont
like
this
beer
or
think
its
a
subpar
offering
from
fff
but
i
disagree
i
really
enjoy
the
malt
and
bitterness
that
comes
from
it
the
beer
pours
a
rich
looking
dark
brown
with
an
overzealous
offwhite
head
that
thinly
blankets
the
nose
is
slightly
metallic
roasty
caramel
a
touch
of
booze
and
uncharacteristically
unbitter
the
taste
presents
a
decent
amount
of
caramel
very
little
bitterness
surprisingly
and
a
lingering
bready
maltiness
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
bready
and
sweet
this
beer
is
tasty
but
id
prefer
a
fff
hop
monster
any
day
the

the
bruce
is
definitely
my
favorite
among
the
three
floyds
it
does
have
a
bit
of
a
bite
but
i
enjoy
that
in
a
good
ale
it
has
a
nice
dark
amber
look
to
it
and
has
a
good
balance
of
flavor
savages
ale
house
in
muncie
indiana
is
where
i
always
go
to
enjoy
this
ale
on
tap
a
hoppy
amber
a
hoppy
scotch
ale
whatever
the
style
its
delicious
im
a
big
fan
of
the
style
and
fff
hit
the
mark
with
this
one
nearly
a
must
try
i
dont
understand
the
low
ratings
given
not
the
epitome
of
craft
beer
but
an
excellent
session
brew
o
very
nice
not
top
shelf
as
far
as
scotch
ales
go
but
i
could
see
myself
drinking
this
on
a
semiregular
basis
if
it
was
available
near
me
personal
rate
3
75
taste
is
good
sharp
sweet
malts
some
sharp
booze
cherry
maybe
its
good
not
blowing
my
mind
its
an
easy
scotch
ale
but
nice
mild
flavors
worth
a
try
for
sure
o
not
something
i
would
drink
all
the
time
but
it
certainly
wins
points
for
being
very
unique
these
guys
sure
do
make
a
different
kind
of
beer
dont
they
o
a
very
nice
job
on
this
scotch
beer
from
3f
i
know
theyre
known
for
not
being
normal
with
styles
but
whos
to
say
you
cant
make
a
beer
within
the
style
and
execute
it
very
well
kudos
3f
for
my
first
beer
from
you
and
to
many
more
o
this
is
a
decent
not
great
brew
i
wouldnt
really
keep
it
in
a
rotation
but
worth
a
try
first
fff
brew
that
im
not
in
love
with
o
i
wasnt
expecting
great
things
from
this
beer
but
i
am
still
let
down
if
a
fairly
new
homebrewer
tried
to
do
a
raison
detre
clone
this
might
be
what
it
would
taste
like
im
not
sure
if
im
even
going
to
finish
it
ugh
o
good
would
be
a
decent
regular
beer
doesnt
stand
out
but
tastes
decent
poured
a
very
stout
and
strong
two
finger
head
with
a
dark
copper
coloring
that
impressed
me
greatly
the
scent
has
a
bit
of
a
fruity
note
kind
of
sweet
like
apple
it
may
be
my
imagination
but
i
got
a
pear
like
taste
with
a
smooth
alcohol
finish
very
nice
finish
but
a
pronounced
ale
flavor
that
makes
me
think
i
will
buy
this
again
o
its
decent
at
best
not
exactly
my
favorite
style
but
i
do
like
the
intense
caramel
this
style
has
to
offer
with
that
being
said
i
dont
find
much
balance
in
this
brew
i
feel
that
the
grassy
hops
are
too
much
and
they
quickly
take
away
what
would
be
an
excellent
sweetness
created
by
the
caramel
and
vanilla
o
this
beer
seems
very
easy
to
drink
compared
to
some
of
the
other
beers
in
the
style
o
i
was
hoping
for
a
little
bit
more
peat
smokiness
in
my
scottish
ale
this
is
a
little
easier
to
drink
than
a
lot
of
other
offerings
in
the
style
as
it
is
not
as
sweet
as
they
often
are
a
very
solid
offering
and
one
i
would
have
again
o
love
this
beer
have
a
nice
selection
of
12
oz
bottles
in
the
fridge
and
this
is
old
faithful
delicious
refreshing
and
goes
down
oh
so
easily
well
done
three
floyds
d
i
had
wanted
to
try
this
one
for
quite
a
while
and
am
very
happy
to
have
had
the
opportunity
unfortunately
this
one
was
a
bit
of
a
let
down
and
my
least
favorite
of
the
fff
that
i
have
tried
though
still
quite
good
this
one
was
a
bit
rough
around
the
edges
absolute
best
scottish
style
ale
oa
wonderful
beer
i
love
a
well
made
scotch
ale
and
this
is
a
great
example
overall
a
solid
scottish
ale
here
good
maltiness
ive
had
this
brew
many
times
finally
getting
around
to
a
review
thanks
to
dave
for
bringing
a
bottle
over
the
beer
is
dark
amber
with
burgundy
highlights
aromas
of
toffee
brown
sugar
yeast
brown
breads
and
malt
with
yeast
and
a
touch
of
hops
in
the
finish
alcohol
presence
is
moderate
medium
carbonation
with
a
growing
sweetness
this
is
alright
deep
mahogany
color
and
thick
white
head
from
what
i
could
see
in
the
dimly
lit
bar
malty
smell
with
a
touch
of
caramel
and
chocolate
creamy
mouthfeel
giving
way
to
the
malts
and
caramel
sweetness
quite
nice
of
the
small
number
of
three
floyds
beers
ive
tried
this
one
is
my
favorite
so
far
though
i
think
i
would
find
myself
reaching
for
an
alpha
king
more
frequently
pours
a
dark
reddishbrown
with
a
thin
white
head
smell
is
of
caramel
malt
its
nice
but
a
bit
onedimensional
and
not
all
that
prominent
flavor
is
malty
and
a
little
sweet
with
a
slight
roastybitter
kick
on
the
back
end
unfortunately
it
tastes
way
too
boozy
for
a
6
5
beer
i
shouldnt
be
able
to
taste
alcohol
at
all
but
im
definitely
getting
a
little
bit
here
mouthfeel
is
mediumbodied
and
smooth
overall
this
is
a
good
not
great
beer
from
3
floyds
on
the
spectrum
of
3
floyds
beers
this
is
one
of
their
weaker
ones
but
on
the
spectrum
of
beer
in
general
this
one
is
certainly
above
average
pours
a
reddish
dark
amber
bordering
on
brown
with
a
two
finger
offwhite
head
no
lacing
evident
as
the
head
recedes
notes
of
caramel
chocolate
and
roasty
malts
on
the
nose
opens
with
the
taste
of
toffee
cocao
nibs
bread
and
a
bit
of
smoke
roasted
malts
join
in
as
the
hops
that
have
been
present
but
in
the
background
surface
to
add
a
bite
of
bitterness
on
the
finish
smooth
medium
body
and
a
medium
level
of
carbonation
malty
goodness
but
not
quite
as
peaty
as
most
other
scottishscotch
ales
o
an
aboveaverage
beer
and
one
id
happily
drink
again
with
founders
and
what
some
would
argue
as
their
flagship
dirty
bastard
less
than
10
miles
down
the
road
though
its
hard
to
put
this
above
the
founders
offering
o
if
you
love
scotch
in
your
beer
then
avoid
this
one
its
a
great
year
round
offering
and
an
easy
drinker
to
boot
poured
a
hazy
reddish
amber
color
into
a
russian
river
pint
glass
smell
is
nice
smoked
malts
caramel
and
toffee
taste
is
amazingly
well
balanced
for
a
scotch
ale
peated
malts
once
again
some
dark
fruit
toffee
somewhat
bready
and
not
to
heavy
surprisingly
seasionable
thanks
rudi
o
smoother
than
i
was
expecting
a
fine
prelude
to
my
trip
to
scotland
even
better
as
it
warms
love
those
malts
o
this
was
a
nice
beer
but
nothing
spectacular
easy
to
drink
nice
flavor
but
nothing
that
stands
out
against
other
beers
nice
offering
from
fff
as
a
year
round
offering
available
in
6packs
overall
a
good
showcase
of
malt
per
the
style
but
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
i
would
gladly
drink
another
overall
this
was
a
disappointment
i
love
a
good
scotch
ale
but
this
one
was
pretty
underwhelming
glad
i
got
it
as
an
extra
because
i
have
always
wanted
to
try
it
and
thats
all
i
have
to
say
about
that
m
medium
bodied
really
lighter
than
it
looks
i
totally
dug
this
beer
but
it
just
seemed
to
be
lacking
something
that
i
cant
quite
put
my
finger
on
i
dont
know
if
i
sat
on
the
beer
for
too
long
it
was
sitting
in
my
fridge
for
about
3
or
4
months
but
id
totally
be
willing
to
have
it
again
good
enough
though
not
a
typical
variation
of
the
stylealso
not
particularly
drinkable
o
very
tasty
i
could
use
a
little
more
aroma
though
this
beer
pours
a
super
hazy
dark
amberbrown
with
only
light
getting
through
it
has
a
unique
spiciness
for
a
scottish
ale
and
it
also
has
a
notable
hop
presence
it
traditional
of
three
floyds
and
is
slightly
fruity
and
piney
but
not
too
noticeable
the
malt
flavors
are
roasted
malts
and
a
tiny
bit
of
dark
fruits
some
caramel
as
well
this
is
more
bitter
then
most
scottish
ales
but
is
pretty
creamy
smooth
at
the
same
time
a
pretty
darn
good
scotch
ale
hands
down
o
i
am
really
enjoying
this
beer
nothing
bad
to
say
about
it
nice
drinkable
ale
from
fff
mouth
feel
is
pretty
smooth
medium
in
body
o
this
is
pretty
good
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
scotch
ales
but
im
diggin
this
beer
id
drink
this
again
if
given
the
oppertunity
o
one
of
the
better
scotch
ales
that
i
have
had
no
one
flavour
dominated
the
nose
or
palate
very
complex
and
very
well
balanced
the
title
its
not
normal
sums
this
beer
up
poured
into
my
trusty
pint
glass
golden
color
with
nice
head
smells
a
little
strong
and
taste
smooth
as
candy
moutful
feeling
for
a
nice
6
pack
to
have
on
a
daily
basis
i
would
recommend
this
scottish
ale
overall
i
dont
think
i
have
had
any
other
scottish
ale
so
this
is
my
benchmark
i
quite
enjoy
it
overall
a
nice
bold
fruity
sweet
scottish
ale
with
more
of
an
alcohol
presence
than
the
abv
suggests
overall
another
impressive
brew
from
a
great
brewery
flavorful
close
to
the
true
spirit
of
the
style
with
the
mouthfeel
to
improve
the
drinkability
do
a
fine
example
of
a
style
that
often
runs
way
too
sweet
for
my
liking
i
appreciated
the
balance
in
this
beer
and
would
certainly
repeat
this
in
the
future
if
the
opportunity
presented
itself
that
said
i
have
a
second
in
my
fridge
right
now
and
will
opt
to
instead
open
something
else
up
o
tatsy
but
not
very
inspiring
it
is
a
really
easy
drinking
malt
and
smoke
forward
beer
though
o
its
a
pretty
good
maltdark
sugar
brew
but
presents
just
a
tad
too
much
burntbitterness
to
make
it
jump
to
the
front
of
the
pack
ill
definitely
buy
more
because
i
enjoy
the
style
and
its
close
like
a
pitch
on
the
corner
but
its
not
the
best
in
its
class
id
like
to
see
the
finish
linger
longer
and
feature
more
of
a
straightahead
caramelized
malts
with
just
a
touch
of
peat
smoke
quality
where
im
left
remembering
the
malts
and
sugars
rather
than
the
hops
very
chewy
malt
backbone
and
a
malt
lovers
dream
well
right
after
doppelbocks
of
course
o
this
is
a
solid
example
of
an
underepresented
style
great
malty
character
with
a
nice
display
of
the
complexity
malt
can
have
on
a
beer
worth
trying
over
and
over
again
overall
its
just
sort
of
blah
its
malty
with
some
overcookedbroccoli
hops
meh
slightly
disappointed
in
this
one
i
think
i
was
just
expecting
something
else
most
likely
my
favorite
scottish
ale
they
are
usually
way
too
boozy
for
my
taste
thank
you
3
floyds
highly
recommended
looking
forward
to
dining
at
the
brewpub
for
my
birthday
this
weekend
poured
from
bottle
to
pint
glass
the
beer
arrives
a
mahagoney
amber
brown
color
with
a
1
finger
offwhite
head
excellent
retention
and
lacing
the
nose
is
that
of
roasted
malt
dark
fruits
sweet
caramel
and
a
hint
of
chocolate
no
hint
of
alcohol
at
all
the
flavor
begins
with
the
roasted
malt
and
is
soon
merged
with
the
caramel
malt
sweetness
found
in
the
nose
a
subtle
chocolate
flavor
blends
well
with
a
dark
fruit
tone
mildly
bitter
finishes
creamy
and
smooth
with
a
lingering
caramel
sweetness
a
little
dry
medium
bodied
and
creamy
nice
mouthfeel
overall
this
isnt
a
style
i
flock
to
though
this
is
a
good
beer
and
one
that
i
would
enjoy
again
and
again
recommended
o
amazing
scent
but
pretty
average
slightly
above
after
that
fuller
medium
body
decent
carbonation
creamy
and
smooth
on
the
tongue
this
is
a
really
nice
scotch
ale
without
an
overbearing
booze
presence
poured
into
a
tulip
a
deep
burgundy
pour
with
about
an
inch
of
off
white
fluffy
head
smells
of
chocolate
berries
oak
and
toffee
rise
up
quickly
very
chocolatey
tasting
a
musky
grape
backbone
with
toasted
grains
very
rich
and
creamy
and
a
bit
fun
on
the
cheeks
with
the
combination
of
sweet
malts
and
roasted
grains
this
is
delicious
of
course
another
great
3
floyds
beer
what
a
surprise
o
what
a
great
tasting
brew
from
fff
this
is
one
i
could
enjoy
every
evening
malts
are
plentiful
and
tasty
its
flavors
are
complex
enough
to
keep
it
interesting
yet
remaining
well
balanced
robert
the
bruce
is
way
up
there
on
my
go
to
list
and
is
hard
to
pass
up
everytime
i
see
it
on
shelves
what
would
i
do
without
fff
just
a
solid
and
great
tasting
beer
overall
i
would
and
will
purchase
this
one
again
really
nice
flavors
here
alcohol
is
hidden
perfectly
and
there
are
so
many
nice
flavors
here
to
enjoy
stands
up
well
to
flavorful
salads
and
pizza
highly
recommend
pretty
easy
drinking
but
not
what
i
would
expect
from
a
scottish
ale
at
all
this
reminds
me
a
lot
of
pride
and
joy
from
three
floyds
in
that
it
is
a
decent
beer
but
far
from
close
stylistically
to
the
beer
its
labeled
as
overall
solid
especially
for
the
style
nice
depth
of
flavor
tons
of
malts
and
sweetness
but
its
never
overbearing
it
mystifies
me
that
three
floyds
can
make
something
this
malty
and
turn
around
and
make
their
hop
juggernauts
skill
medium
body
low
carbonation
crisp
and
smooth
a
different
take
on
the
scottish
ale
style
and
i
like
it
pours
a
hazy
mahogany
with
ruby
highlights
and
thin
tan
head
which
quickly
dissipates
the
carbonation
is
moderate
and
mouthfeel
is
smooth
the
nose
is
caramel
malt
dark
fruit
vanilla
and
oak
taste
is
caramel
roasted
malt
burnt
sugar
tangy
dark
fruits
good
bitterness
and
vanilla
towards
the
end
its
well
balanced
and
very
drinkable
m
medium
bodied
sticky
texture
complements
the
heavy
flavors
within
quite
well
carbonation
is
high
enough
to
frame
the
flavors
properly
without
being
distracting
this
here
beer
is
therefore
a
standard
bearer
meaning
it
is
to
some
degree
beyond
reproach
that
aint
the
only
degree
though
because
otherwise
sierra
nevada
pale
would
get
a
perfect
5
on
this
here
site
mostly
though
it
pulls
off
the
rare
feat
of
blending
a
brewers
completely
unique
completely
recognizable
identity
with
enough
of
a
styles
signifiers
to
still
count
as
belonging
to
that
style
without
being
a
boring
boilerplate
example
of
that
style
medium
bodied
with
excellent
carbonation
this
beer
is
a
bit
too
dark
for
how
drinkable
it
is
the
body
is
smooth
and
slick
and
does
not
become
sticky
or
coating
at
any
point
the
carbonation
is
just
fizzy
enough
to
increase
the
drinkability
without
inhibiting
the
flavors
overall
while
the
flavors
are
above
average
and
enjoyable
for
a
sessionable
malt
fix
this
beer
is
lacking
some
alcohol
heat
the
body
is
on
the
light
side
of
medium
it
goes
down
pretty
slick
and
finishes
chalky
and
dry
overall
its
a
good
beer
but
struggles
to
live
up
to
3fs
other
offering
perhaps
not
being
hopcentric
is
a
hindrance
on
that
yet
the
flavor
is
solid
and
i
would
certainly
drink
another
this
beer
is
great
start
to
finish
you
want
near
perfect
scorech
alek
its
this
o
i
havent
had
this
beer
in
a
few
years
and
since
i
fell
in
love
with
ipas
i
wasnt
missing
a
lot
this
is
a
ok
beer
and
a
decent
scotch
ale
o
one
of
my
favorites
from
three
floyds
but
with
3f
its
difficult
not
to
love
their
creativity
excellent
brew
all
the
way
around
o
excellent
perfect
beer
for
those
not
that
into
craft
or
for
someone
who
isnt
a
hophead
o
tasty
scottish
style
ale
balance
is
a
touch
too
malty
for
my
taste
could
use
a
bit
more
hops
but
is
appropriate
for
the
style
wont
be
my
last
of
these
o
this
is
another
gem
by
fff
it
satisfies
my
love
of
malt
bombs
with
the
refreshing
aspects
of
hops
o
i
love
this
beer
i
could
envision
this
one
being
one
that
would
get
someone
into
craft
beer
this
beer
for
me
ranks
among
the
best
out
there
o
a
very
nice
winter
beer
one
that
holds
up
to
the
nip
in
the
air
and
warms
you
up
while
i
would
normally
suggest
pairing
a
beer
in
this
style
with
salmon
here
i
am
thinking
perhaps
chocolate
cheescake
or
perhaps
bacon
wrapped
apricots
o
this
is
a
pretty
solid
beer
i
believe
it
has
a
lot
of
room
to
improve
on
but
its
still
pretty
decent
o
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
scotch
ales
but
this
one
is
ok
one
is
more
than
enough
by
itself
a
hearty
winter
meal
would
be
good
to
suit
it
t
complex
and
well
balanced
all
the
aromas
are
present
the
body
is
heavy
the
aftertaste
is
bitter
and
the
alcohol
is
noticed
more
smoky
flavour
than
sweet
caramel
o
fff
really
killed
it
on
their
take
of
a
scottish
ale
all
the
sweetness
is
there
that
you
would
expect
of
the
style
their
not
normal
take
is
to
add
a
nice
balance
of
hops
to
go
along
with
the
sweetness
great
stuff
overall
from
the
aroma
i
wasnt
wxpecting
the
sweetness
up
front
it
was
a
nice
welcome
though
definitely
a
decent
scottish
ale
cheers
o
a
very
good
scotch
ale
i
enjoyed
the
slight
hoppy
undertone
ive
come
to
love
throughout
the
fff
beers
very
well
balance
overall
i
like
this
i
had
my
first
scottish
ale
about
2
weeks
ago
when
i
cracked
this
six
pack
so
i
dont
have
much
to
compare
to
but
once
again
3floyds
puts
out
a
quality
product
nice
not
perfect
take
on
the
style
really
hits
to
spot
on
coolcold
north
carolina
evening
overall
a
great
scottish
ale
hearty
o
i
like
this
beer
alot
not
usually
a
malt
lover
but
something
about
this
beer
does
it
for
me
like
it
yeah
overall
this
is
an
enjoyable
beer
but
boy
is
it
sweet
sweet
enough
to
keep
me
from
having
more
than
one
at
a
time
wonder
if
its
underattenuated
i
think
it
could
finish
a
lot
more
dry
overall
pretty
hoppy
for
a
scottish
ale
giving
it
a
little
more
complexity
than
most
however
i
feel
that
the
bitterness
is
a
distraction
from
the
malts
o
not
one
of
my
staple
styles
but
this
stands
out
from
the
crowd
and
is
very
good
nicely
balanced
definitely
maltcentric
but
not
overpowering
at
all
well
nuanced
and
complex
flavors
definitely
recommend
giving
this
one
a
try
overall
i
enjoy
this
beer
it
is
readily
available
and
this
is
a
decent
winter
beer
to
me
a
wonderful
example
of
the
style
bring
this
one
to
oh
fff
o
well
my
review
makes
this
look
like
a
bad
beer
its
not
in
fact
i
think
three
floyds
has
made
a
very
good
brown
ale
here
its
light
sweet
and
has
just
enough
delicate
roast
to
it
that
makes
it
highly
quaffable
but
i
grade
to
style
and
robert
the
bruce
misses
the
mark
in
that
regard
o
simply
put
just
wonderful
o
i
think
this
a
fantastic
brew
and
one
that
pays
homage
to
its
respective
style
no
date
code
but
i
think
this
is
a
seasonal
and
i
believe
my
sample
is
fresh
beer
pours
out
a
brownish
color
with
a
tan
head
not
much
lacing
or
anything
too
remarkable
smells
like
toffee
some
faint
dark
chocolate
molasses
and
yet
no
smoke
which
i
find
sorta
odd
tastes
nicely
bittersweet
some
rich
dark
roasted
malts
with
a
slight
bitter
aftertaste
nicely
balanced
not
very
earthy
or
peaty
like
i
have
found
with
other
scottish
inspired
ales
i
swear
years
ago
this
was
a
different
beer
big
earthy
malts
and
sweet
alcohol
but
now
it
reminds
me
of
a
nice
brown
ale
dont
get
me
wrong
this
is
a
good
beer
but
quite
uncharacteristic
of
the
style
and
somewhat
normal
for
a
three
floyds
beer
mouthfeel
is
fine
overall
a
decent
beer
but
kinda
marginal
for
such
an
awesome
brewer
and
please
date
code
your
beer
guys
overall
this
was
a
bit
nicer
on
draft
as
the
flavors
are
bolder
great
brew
and
im
sure
glad
i
have
access
to
it
yearround
pours
to
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
creamy
head
great
retention
the
malts
really
come
through
on
the
nose
of
this
beer
lots
of
caramel
with
a
hint
of
toffee
and
bread
as
with
almost
everything
three
floyds
produces
i
really
enjoy
the
taste
of
this
beer
very
malty
but
with
a
subtle
estery
sweetness
i
taste
the
caramel
notes
and
the
finish
is
wonderfully
bitter
very
smooth
with
a
creamy
full
body
this
is
a
very
good
beer
an
interesting
and
refreshing
take
on
the
scottish
ale
nice
work
again
fff
mouthfeel
is
very
light
and
thin
with
very
mild
carbonation
a
light
body
that
borders
on
medium
and
a
slightly
bitter
finish
thats
sweet
as
it
slides
down
like
theres
caramel
or
syrup
in
milk
not
a
session
beer
for
me
because
its
not
my
favorite
style
but
this
beer
went
down
very
easy
for
7
abv
and
i
did
enjoy
it
quite
a
bit
o
pretty
decent
i
would
even
venture
to
say
good
though
this
style
isnt
my
favorite
a
hearty
maltforward
beers
with
good
body
and
fairly
decent
flavors
this
is
one
of
my
go
to
beers
very
enjoyable
very
drinkable
a
good
take
on
the
style
d
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
it
was
a
bit
pricey
but
im
certainly
happy
to
have
bought
it
not
my
favorite
of
the
style
but
tasty
and
complex
none
the
less
overall
the
body
of
the
beer
is
medium
and
the
finish
is
medium
as
well
this
a
good
scottish
ale
however
i
would
have
preferred
a
bit
bolder
flavor
good
beer
overall
now
i
am
going
to
don
my
kilt
and
start
to
dance
robert
the
bruce
is
an
uncomplicated
ale
malty
sweet
and
smooth
with
a
whisper
of
bitter
to
finish
i
could
easily
put
down
a
few
of
these
in
an
evening
this
ale
is
comfortable
and
familiar
easy
to
have
around
and
pleasant
to
drink
it
wont
shock
the
tastebuds
but
will
instead
embrace
and
console
them
give
ol
robert
a
try
overall
not
great
but
not
bad
glad
i
tried
it
nothing
bad
about
the
beer
just
not
so
interesting
its
a
style
that
i
dont
know
a
lot
about
but
it
seems
to
me
that
this
beer
wants
to
be
bigger
than
it
is
o
havent
delved
too
much
into
scottish
ales
just
dirty
bastard
which
isnt
technically
a
scotch
ale
but
this
was
pretty
good
overall
impression
not
one
of
fffs
best
brews
i
thought
i
would
never
see
the
day
that
i
would
say
this
but
this
one
just
wasnt
bodied
enough
for
me
also
should
have
had
more
richness
and
flavor
will
be
moving
onto
my
next
fff
beer
and
will
probably
not
come
back
to
this
anytime
soon
i
saved
two
bottles
for
myself
out
of
the
6pack
i
purchased
for
myself
and
friends
so
this
will
be
revisited
in
the
near
future
o
not
my
favorite
pick
from
three
floyds
but
nonetheless
a
solid
beer
with
a
couple
tweeks
it
could
be
even
better
o
now
this
is
a
scottish
ale
one
of
my
favorites
from
the
scdottish
and
scotch
ale
family
big
deep
robust
malty
flavor
very
enjoyable
and
well
done
by
fff
pours
a
deep
amber
color
with
a
chill
haze
little
silky
head
dies
down
to
nothing
aroma
is
full
of
roasted
malt
peaty
and
a
touch
floral
in
the
taste
malty
notes
of
chocolate
moss
peat
and
smoke
mild
bitterness
combatting
big
roasted
malt
and
brown
sugar
herbal
tea
like
notes
along
with
a
suggestion
of
american
bittering
hops
fairly
complex
and
completely
delicious
medium
bodied
smooth
a
good
carbonation
level
overall
a
fantastic
scotch
ale
with
bold
yet
enjoyable
flavors
o
this
is
a
nice
scottish
ale
that
had
the
perfect
roast
on
the
malts
and
really
let
the
caramel
and
toffee
flavors
come
to
the
forefront
with
the
higher
abv
i
couldnt
see
myself
having
more
than
one
or
two
of
these
o
this
is
a
good
beer
but
nothing
ill
be
looking
to
get
again
anytime
soon
the
most
impressive
aspect
of
this
one
was
drinkability
goes
down
very
easily
and
the
alcohol
is
masked
very
well
that
being
said
i
was
hoping
for
a
more
robust
and
bold
beer
given
the
abv
i
dont
have
much
experience
drinking
scottish
ales
but
ill
be
looking
to
try
more
in
the
future
i
was
fairly
impressed
with
this
one
but
im
hoping
to
try
some
that
are
a
bit
tastier
i
like
this
beer
from
3
floyds
though
i
always
expect
something
exceptional
i
wouldnt
shy
away
from
this
one
regardless
this
brew
is
really
nice
the
brew
pours
as
a
nice
brown
color
with
a
light
tan
colored
head
there
isnt
too
much
lacing
but
the
retention
holds
for
a
while
the
smell
of
this
beer
is
sweet
with
malts
and
it
also
has
a
little
bit
of
earth
of
in
there
too
the
flavors
of
caramel
and
malts
set
this
beer
off
in
the
right
direction
the
aftertaste
is
a
little
nutty
and
dry
not
major
bitterness
in
this
brew
at
all
the
mouthfeel
is
really
easy
to
drink
could
put
a
few
of
these
down
pretty
quick
if
you
wanted
too
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
scotish
ale
o
solid
beer
but
may
not
be
worth
the
3fs
billing
they
have
plenty
of
other
beers
and
this
is
not
their
best
its
not
even
the
best
scottish
ale
in
the
world
but
its
fine
and
there
arent
many
available
so
here
it
is
only
better
scottish
ale
i
had
was
a
home
brew
o
its
a
nice
tasting
beer
with
an
alcohol
kick
which
i
like
lingering
malty
sweetness
that
finishes
on
the
dry
side
a
hint
of
dark
roast
malt
sticks
around
o
a
very
satisfying
brew
this
would
be
easy
to
session
and
not
grow
tired
of
after
the
3rd
or
4th
i
dont
say
that
about
many
a
beer
so
fff
mustve
done
something
right
o
delicious
ale
that
did
lack
hop
bitterness
i
would
expect
of
this
style
it
is
a
sweet
malt
bomb
that
i
would
definitely
enjoy
again
o
nice
scottish
ale
very
malty
i
am
happy
that
i
was
able
to
try
it
i
would
order
this
again
rich
taste
malty
sweet
up
front
with
hints
of
maple
peat
and
dried
dark
fruit
i
didnt
catch
the
hops
presence
in
there
but
even
without
this
is
a
superlative
ale
worthy
of
repeat
purchase
admittedly
im
not
the
biggest
fan
of
the
style
but
this
beer
acquits
itself
just
fine
not
something
i
will
purchase
on
a
regular
or
even
semiregular
basis
but
a
beer
worth
trying
now
its
time
for
pizza
overall
i
would
order
this
beer
again
it
was
3
50
pint
night
so
i
couldnt
pass
up
a
value
like
that
on
a
beer
thats
normally
5
if
im
in
the
mood
for
something
a
little
heavier
with
some
more
flavor
especially
in
the
coming
colder
months
ill
know
where
to
turn
for
a
solid
brew
o
i
like
it
perhaps
my
least
favorite
fff
ive
had
so
far
but
thats
like
picking
the
least
favorite
of
a
lamborghini
ferrari
and
bentley
o
over
all
a
good
scottish
ale
that
deserves
respect
a
little
watery
but
the
taste
makes
up
what
is
not
there
in
the
mouthfeel
i
dont
really
know
the
style
that
well
so
its
kinda
hard
for
me
to
judge
this
one
thanks
dave
overall
a
good
beer
and
one
i
would
happily
enjoy
but
i
think
i
expected
a
little
much
o
this
one
is
difficult
to
rate
i
had
high
expectations
for
my
first
three
floyds
beer
and
i
really
like
big
malty
scottish
brews
this
one
didnt
quite
meet
those
expectations
even
though
it
is
a
good
beer
a
very
robust
and
tasty
scottish
ale
big
thanks
to
eric
for
bringing
this
treat
by
overall
ive
never
had
a
scotch
ale
like
this
its
different
not
really
smokey
or
even
malty
but
it
has
some
fantastic
characters
that
make
it
extremely
appealing
really
a
distinct
beer
that
blurs
the
lines
overall
a
bit
too
sweet
if
you
ask
me
although
no
one
did
i
would
have
liked
a
little
more
balance
but
not
bad
at
all
not
sure
if
id
have
another
or
not
overall
i
had
heard
and
read
good
things
about
this
brew
so
i
was
pretty
let
down
by
what
i
found
i
love
fff
and
love
this
style
as
well
unfortunately
imo
a
good
scottish
ale
does
not
three
floyds
make
it
came
across
as
a
mediocre
homebrew
o
great
overall
very
balanced
scottish
ale
looking
forward
to
moving
along
the
fff
roster
having
said
that
this
is
still
a
flavorful
and
easily
drinkable
beer
i
hope
to
someday
meet
robert
again
and
see
if
we
cant
get
along
a
little
better
d
this
is
not
a
beer
to
be
paired
with
much
food
the
amplitude
of
all
its
flavors
would
crowd
most
things
out
like
its
namesake
its
strong
and
defiant
aggressive
even
but
youre
not
put
off
because
its
on
the
right
side
o
very
drinkablethe
6
5
abv
is
virtually
undetectable
goes
down
well
this
is
my
first
example
of
the
style
so
ill
have
to
try
other
varieties
to
really
get
a
sense
of
how
this
compares
i
like
it
though
mellow
rich
malty
beer
cheers
to
be
honest
i
am
a
little
surprised
by
just
how
much
i
loved
this
beer
i
usually
consider
myself
more
of
a
hophead
and
dont
really
ever
venture
into
this
kind
of
malty
territory
with
that
said
all
i
can
really
do
at
this
point
is
raise
my
glass
to
another
stellar
offering
from
three
floyds
pours
a
clean
mahogany
color
with
small
cap
of
off
white
head
little
retention
and
lacing
scent
is
a
big
initial
whiff
of
heavily
toasted
malt
with
dark
caramel
and
notes
of
prune
and
fig
but
seems
to
disappear
quickly
taste
is
mild
a
initial
dry
toasted
malt
before
light
sweetness
comes
in
in
the
form
of
dark
caramel
definite
nuttiness
fig
and
notes
of
earth
and
chocolate
poke
through
medium
bodied
smooth
and
clean
some
good
notes
but
light
and
unremarkable
for
the
style
overall
another
solid
beer
from
fff
a
nice
straight
forward
easy
drinking
scotch
ale
not
very
complex
but
nice
the
more
i
have
from
them
the
more
they
move
up
my
list
of
favorite
breweries
d
the
alcohol
sneaks
up
on
you
on
this
one
average
drinkability
but
not
something
i
would
have
many
of
overall
a
solid
scottish
ale
that
hit
the
style
with
fff
absurdity
i
like
it
o
a
pretty
good
beer
its
not
blowing
me
away
but
quite
drinkable
for
style
o
pretty
tasty
and
seems
to
fit
the
style
but
i
cant
imagine
having
more
than
12
of
these
in
a
night
it
would
be
like
ordering
2
desserts
and
realizing
halfway
through
the
second
one
that
it
was
a
bad
idea
o
its
alright
worth
a
try
of
course
i
wont
revisit
but
doesnt
mean
you
shouldnt
the
aroma
is
malty
roasted
chocolate
caramel
the
taste
very
nice
nose
the
taste
is
quite
similar
than
the
nose
some
spices
comes
almost
no
bitterness
the
aftertaste
is
caramelish
malty
but
very
short
very
good
beer
afterall
o
im
not
a
fan
of
scotch
ales
but
this
one
is
surprisingly
tolerable
i
like
it
and
i
like
three
floyds
and
i
like
robert
the
bruce
and
i
like
braveheart
and
mel
gibson
is
okay
but
hes
not
real
cool
anymore
and
might
be
clinically
insane
kind
of
a
cross
between
a
scottish
and
brown
ale
a
very
nice
and
drinkable
dark
ale
by
3
floyds
o
not
necessarily
a
true
to
form
scotch
ale
but
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
i
will
definitely
buy
again
o
a
really
enjoyable
session
beer
i
wish
i
had
more
access
to
it
o
a
well
executed
scottish
ale
d
very
flat
no
carbonation
slightly
sweet
and
mouth
coating
on
tap
at
three
floyds
this
is
a
medium
translucent
caramel
brown
color
smells
include
brown
sugar
and
molasses
taste
is
sweet
brown
sugar
and
aged
oak
or
maple
medium
bodied
and
very
drinkable
this
is
not
overly
exciting
but
solid
and
refreshing
o
eh
it
was
ok
ive
had
much
better
than
this
probably
the
only
beer
from
3f
that
was
ok
i
guess
wont
seek
this
one
out
again
this
is
a
beer
i
enjoyed
while
it
was
in
my
household
however
i
will
not
be
seeking
this
beer
again
and
will
not
recommend
it
to
a
friend
o
i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
i
would
recommend
it
to
anyone
that
wants
to
experience
this
style
i
will
definitely
buy
this
again
if
i
can
find
it
served
from
bottle
into
a
stone
nonic
poured
a
deep
redorange
with
a
half
finger
offwhite
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
quickly
maintained
decent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
caramel
oatmeal
and
chocolate
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
citrus
caramel
and
milk
chocolate
it
had
a
medium
feel
on
the
palate
with
mild
carbonation
overall
this
was
quite
a
nice
brew
really
nice
for
the
style
which
is
hard
for
me
as
i
usually
dont
enjoy
this
style
too
much
the
flavor
was
very
nice
on
this
one
with
the
sweetness
aspect
going
on
here
kept
me
coming
back
for
more
the
aroma
was
quite
inviting
as
well
definitely
worth
trying
for
any
fan
of
the
style
or
for
anyone
curious
about
the
style
in
general
this
is
one
of
the
more
sticktoyourribs
kind
of
beers
i
have
ever
had
would
be
excellent
i
think
w
bbq
or
maybe
as
a
digestif
paired
w
chocolate
cake
12oz
bottle
courtesy
of
fata2683
pours
clear
mahogany
with
massive
tan
head
active
carbonation
and
some
lacing
developing
aroma
has
caramel
dried
fruit
apricot
and
dates
noticeably
and
some
florals
taste
is
sweet
with
caramel
malts
and
dried
fruit
again
medium
bodied
with
slick
texture
and
very
smooth
finish
a
really
easy
beer
to
drink
nice
to
sum
this
beer
up
its
good
not
great
now
may
i
have
another
this
beer
wants
to
be
a
barely
wine
but
isnt
strong
enough
for
it
this
beer
wants
to
be
some
kinda
of
belgian
style
but
doesnt
have
the
yeast
im
not
sure
i
get
the
scotch
ale
but
well
go
with
it
i
dont
get
why
this
is
the
12
bottled
6
pack
from
themmany
beers
they
make
are
better
for
this
but
it
is
still
a
nice
beer
had
a
meeting
with
the
boys
tonight
at
a
place
called
scoreboards
was
i
surpirsed
they
had
three
floyds
and
more
anyway
had
robert
the
bruce
as
my
starter
the
color
was
a
dark
brown
with
rich
foamy
head
that
laced
quite
well
the
aroma
and
taste
was
dominated
by
malt
and
caramel
the
body
on
the
beer
was
a
little
too
weak
i
would
have
liked
to
have
a
bit
more
heavy
body
the
mouthfeel
was
ok
certainly
could
do
34
of
these
no
problem
solid
scottish
ale
appearance
a
dark
burnt
sienna
with
some
auburn
around
the
edges
in
the
translucent
areas
nose
was
somewhat
muted
and
the
malts
didnt
come
through
in
a
big
way
taste
was
well
balanced
and
enjoyable
a
solid
scottish
ale
for
sure
the
cpj
draft
to
plastic
pint
glass
appearance
is
good
deep
amberbourbon
in
color
smell
is
almost
nonexistent
with
a
subtle
malty
undertone
taste
is
good
malty
just
not
what
i
expected
although
its
still
good
mouthfeel
is
good
low
carbonation
for
easy
sips
overall
a
good
beer
but
a
little
subtler
than
i
expected
overall
this
was
a
pretty
good
beer
very
drinkable
with
a
6
5
abv
also
had
one
of
my
favorite
labels
very
neat
to
look
at
ha
pours
a
nice
dark
chestnut
color
with
a
fairly
thin
head
that
fades
to
a
ring
and
thin
swirly
cap
lots
of
firm
malt
with
a
tofee
and
horlicks
powder
aroma
similar
very
firm
maltiness
in
the
taste
with
a
bit
of
a
sweet
almost
vanilla
finish
as
well
as
some
earthy
and
piney
hops
that
play
a
supporting
role
to
the
malt
long
finish
and
almost
chewy
mouthfeel
make
this
fairly
nive
as
well
quite
decent
o
good
sweet
notes
and
some
good
bread
grain
overall
a
very
good
scottish
ale
quite
delicious
even
though
this
is
not
my
favorite
style
addendum
i
got
another
growler
of
this
recently
i
dont
know
i
guess
i
really
like
it
i
have
to
regrade
the
nose
and
give
it
higher
marks
when
i
was
drinking
this
growler
i
found
myself
holding
the
empty
glass
up
to
my
nose
after
finishing
a
serving
of
this
i
freaking
loved
the
aroma
coming
out
of
that
glass
it
had
this
nice
nutty
sweet
rich
homemade
pie
kind
of
smell
this
beer
is
definitely
growing
on
me
o
pretty
good
beer
not
a
fan
of
scottish
ales
in
general
but
this
is
easy
to
drink
and
nonoffensive
wouldnt
mind
drinking
it
again
o
an
excellent
beer
one
of
my
first
of
the
style
a
good
representation
of
what
im
told
it
should
be
my
favorite
fff
beer
overall
nice
to
see
a
scottish
ale
in
bottles
very
quaffable
even
at
this
abv
happy
to
have
tried
it
but
ill
seek
out
other
fffs
brews
before
picking
up
more
than
this
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
it
was
kind
of
a
malt
showcase
but
there
was
enough
roasty
bitterness
on
the
finish
to
balance
things
out
and
keep
your
palate
interested
pretty
drinkable
given
the
abv
hard
to
tell
on
appearance
but
it
was
nice
and
black
smell
is
tons
of
malt
and
subdued
hops
appropriate
for
the
style
taste
is
pretty
smooth
although
im
scottish
this
isnt
my
favorite
type
of
brew
but
plenty
respectable
mouthfeel
is
exceptional
on
this
surprisingly
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
overall
i
like
it
and
recommend
it
as
a
fine
example
of
its
style
i
must
say
that
i
have
never
had
something
bad
from
three
floyds
and
this
is
true
with
this
one
i
dont
believe
i
will
ever
run
into
one
of
their
beers
that
is
not
above
par
thanks
to
captainnomihodai
for
this
one
o
not
the
strongest
effort
from
fff
overall
it
is
a
nice
beer
but
not
my
favorite
i
love
the
label
but
i
could
list
out
a
dozen
other
beers
from
fff
that
i
would
choose
before
this
overall
good
beer
i
like
the
flavor
of
it
and
its
a
well
crafted
brew
enjoyed
the
complex
character
and
drinkability
of
this
scottish
ale
although
not
well
versed
in
the
style
the
taste
profile
of
robert
the
bruce
appears
spot
on
dreally
like
this
beer
very
balanced
and
easy
to
drink
like
to
drink
this
on
a
cold
day
or
even
a
nice
summer
evening
overall
this
was
a
pleasant
surprise
from
3floyds
this
beer
does
not
get
enough
love
it
is
one
of
the
best
scotch
ales
brewed
stateside
that
i
have
had
another
success
for
a
great
brewery
to
sum
it
up
its
caramelly
and
chocolate
in
the
front
small
roasted
and
coffee
notes
in
the
back
all
in
all
one
of
the
best
examples
of
style
i
can
think
of
complex
drinkable
and
impressive
i
was
really
impressed
with
this
beer
and
how
drinkable
it
is
usually
malty
ales
like
this
are
something
that
i
enjoy
but
savor
this
beer
is
quite
quaffable
and
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
my
usual
beer
choices
too
bad
it
is
not
easier
for
me
to
get
my
hands
on
this
is
a
drinkable
scottish
ale
and
is
more
bitter
than
others
i
have
had
i
feel
like
this
is
a
blend
of
70
brown
ale
and
30
scottish
ale
d
could
easily
down
a
6
pack
seems
a
little
weak
not
my
favorite
3
floyds
dont
go
out
of
your
way
for
this
d
ive
never
been
one
to
drink
many
scotch
ales
but
purely
because
of
the
super
malty
nature
this
i
could
have
a
few
and
be
ok
with
it
quite
nice
and
recommended
overall
not
an
overpowering
beer
too
complex
to
call
it
a
session
but
very
drinkable
with
little
carbonation
taste
is
quite
malty
for
an
ale
in
fact
if
i
did
a
blind
taste
test
i
would
probably
think
i
was
drinking
a
german
schwartz
bier
black
beer
d
not
too
bad
to
drink
but
i
couldnt
drink
more
than
one
the
sweetness
on
the
palate
becomes
overwhelming
after
one
pint
d
so
long
as
i
was
not
smelling
this
and
just
drinking
it
liberally
i
could
drink
this
all
night
quite
drinkable
in
that
regard
otherwise
i
would
only
purchase
this
once
in
a
blue
moon
to
try
and
recall
if
this
is
no
good
i
will
however
likely
try
this
again
once
i
get
another
bottle
thanks
to
dgfair
for
the
extra
12
oz
bottle
no
date
poured
into
a
dimpled
mug
pours
a
rich
mahogany
with
a
thick
fizzy
creamcolored
head
that
quickly
dissipates
to
very
thin
lining
aroma
is
big
dark
malts
caramel
being
the
most
pronounced
with
a
bit
of
raw
sugar
scotchy
peat
and
fresh
bread
the
first
sip
bursts
with
complex
malt
flavors
and
the
chocolate
makes
an
appearance
a
tiny
hoppy
presence
smooths
out
the
chocolate
up
front
and
leads
into
more
standard
malts
as
bread
and
caramel
fill
the
palate
next
something
is
hiding
in
the
depths
of
the
flavor
maybe
a
touch
of
maple
syrup
smooth
a
bit
creamy
but
not
heavy
abv
is
just
right
unnoticeable
but
enough
to
give
the
beer
a
backbone
medium
bodied
with
modest
carbonation
overall
a
good
american
scottish
ale
d
i
wouldnt
want
another
glass
of
this
if
i
have
it
again
it
will
probably
be
for
a
rereview
at
the
insistence
of
someone
else
d
pretty
drinkable
but
this
style
isnt
my
first
choice
when
looking
for
a
sessionable
beer
pours
a
crystal
clear
ruby
color
with
no
cloudiness
what
so
ever
head
formed
with
only
the
slightest
help
with
a
off
white
hue
the
head
was
a
bit
thin
but
hung
around
for
a
bit
no
lacing
threw
the
glass
as
it
was
consumed
the
aroma
was
hardly
noticeable
for
this
style
most
brews
i
have
had
in
this
style
the
aroma
is
not
as
strong
as
other
brews
but
this
particular
brew
was
barely
there
the
taste
was
up
front
bitter
hops
with
only
a
hint
of
a
malty
background
the
malt
was
not
forward
enough
for
this
particular
style
or
really
my
preference
the
carbonation
was
over
done
and
pushed
way
to
much
of
the
hops
forward
i
was
left
with
a
acidic
taste
and
feeling
in
my
mouth
i
was
looking
forward
to
try
this
brew
as
it
is
one
of
my
favorite
styles
but
was
unable
to
stomach
it
hopefully
i
had
a
old
or
bad
bottle
probably
with
age
is
that
i
will
never
know
due
to
the
lack
of
any
dating
on
the
bottle
i
will
give
this
a
try
again
in
the
future
and
rereview
if
needed
a
clear
ruddy
brown
ale
with
a
head
that
quickly
fades
to
a
thin
but
persistent
ring
aroma
is
toasted
malt
with
a
little
hint
of
chocolate
flavor
continues
the
maltforward
theme
easing
from
sugar
to
caramel
sweetness
with
just
enough
roastiness
and
alcohol
to
keep
it
from
being
cloying
yeast
contributes
some
dark
candied
fruit
notes
no
hop
aroma
to
note
just
a
bit
of
bitterness
indistinguishable
from
the
effect
of
the
dark
malt
the
balance
leans
more
toward
the
roast
as
the
beer
warms
which
is
a
good
thing
for
it
overall
a
very
pleasant
and
sessionable
beer
with
the
abv
wellhidden
if
youre
not
hooked
on
hops
drinkability
this
was
very
easy
to
put
down
the
carbonation
was
delicate
and
light
and
the
beer
itself
is
solid
poured
into
a
tulip
dark
brown
with
a
nice
initial
head
dissipates
quickly
i
dont
get
much
for
smell
a
little
malt
but
i
have
to
work
at
it
i
was
a
little
disappointed
taste
is
mostly
malt
with
a
little
hops
kind
of
dark
roasty
sweet
more
hoppy
than
i
expected
most
of
the
flavor
is
towards
the
middle
and
finish
a
good
heavy
but
not
my
favorite
it
has
excellent
carbonation
and
is
light
to
enjoy
multiples
of
overall
i
just
can
not
get
past
the
excessive
maltiness
if
you
like
that
style
then
you
would
probably
love
this
beer
i
tend
to
prefer
more
hops
so
it
is
hard
for
me
to
see
past
that
d
this
really
isnt
my
style
but
i
found
this
particular
example
highly
drinkable
d
its
easy
to
drink
and
it
doesnt
taste
offensive
its
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
notes
like
some
fast
cars
this
bad
boy
looks
nice
and
smells
nice
but
doesnt
deliver
out
on
the
road
d
a
highly
drinkable
scottish
ale
i
wish
i
could
pick
up
a
4
or
6er
or
whatever
they
bottle
it
as
here
in
ohio
but
sadly
not
so
thanks
for
this
one
josh
recommended
for
those
seeking
a
maltier
beer
with
little
hop
presence
i
usually
like
my
beer
very
hopped
up
and
i
found
this
brew
to
be
a
very
nice
change
up
drinkability
very
solid
scotch
ale
and
one
of
the
best
ive
had
in
the
category
overall
lives
up
to
the
hype
d
very
nice
easy
to
drink
beer
good
for
a
cold
take
that
with
a
grain
of
salt
winters
night
in
so
cal
d
nice
drinkability
perhaps
not
a
true
scottish
ale
by
definition
but
pretty
close
good
drink
this
beer
pours
a
light
bodied
burnt
mahogany
in
color
with
red
accents
in
the
light
and
with
no
head
the
aromas
are
of
sweet
malt
and
a
moderate
nuttiness
probably
a
hazelnut
its
solid
but
nothing
special
the
flavor
is
solid
i
like
it
for
the
style
but
it
isnt
anything
too
special
it
drinks
pretty
light
in
body
and
leaves
a
sweet
nutty
after
taste
behind
id
prefer
it
a
little
heavier
its
just
ok
and
drinking
it
is
no
problem
at
all
if
you
want
to
i
poured
this
into
a
pint
glass
thanks
to
kirkpjr
i
was
greeted
with
a
finger
worth
of
tan
head
on
top
of
a
ruby
brown
colored
body
the
aroma
was
nice
and
malty
sweet
with
a
little
toasted
note
found
in
there
as
well
the
flavor
was
sweet
toffee
and
lightly
roasted
coffee
with
a
slight
alcohol
heat
there
also
was
a
slight
bitter
present
as
well
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
light
carbonation
it
was
a
easy
to
drink
high
abv
scotch
ale
i
think
i
could
have
drank
a
couple
of
glasses
of
this
but
i
might
run
into
trouble
with
anymore
all
in
all
this
is
an
ok
brew
so
many
better
brews
by
fff
dont
worry
about
trying
unless
youre
a
fan
of
the
style
d
lower
drinkability
because
of
the
finish
glad
i
only
have
one
that
was
in
a
mix
six
from
casanovas
brown
with
reddish
hues
and
a
bit
of
white
head
around
the
edges
lots
of
roastiness
on
the
nose
that
comes
across
on
the
tongue
first
and
foremost
a
hint
of
fruitiness
as
well
on
the
tongue
and
some
crisp
carbonation
a
very
good
representation
of
the
style
this
beer
pours
a
deep
amber
color
the
aroma
of
this
beer
smells
of
almost
like
a
scotch
or
whiskey
smell
there
is
a
malt
aroma
which
reminds
me
of
that
the
taste
is
malty
and
sweet
with
a
good
hoppy
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
is
a
drinkable
beer
d
a
good
beer
to
enjoy
on
a
cold
lazy
winter
night
but
not
particularly
outstanding
in
any
way
one
or
two
would
be
fine
any
more
would
probably
be
a
bit
tedious
d
not
too
bad
more
than
one
pint
would
get
boring
though
overall
impression
nice
brew
here
recommended
notes
its
still
a
good
offering
from
the
fff
and
a
nice
beer
at
that
and
while
it
sure
manages
to
retain
some
of
the
malty
sense
and
feels
rather
tasty
the
hoppy
side
makes
one
not
want
to
file
it
as
a
scottish
ale
d
a
style
for
the
beer
drinker
with
a
sweet
tooth
robert
the
bruce
doesnt
dissapoint
however
its
not
as
deep
and
full
bodied
as
id
like
overall
definitely
worth
a
try
as
with
almost
the
entire
fff
lineup
d
very
good
a
friend
recommended
this
to
me
awhile
ago
ill
definitely
be
picking
up
more
of
this
in
the
future
the
beer
is
served
surprisingly
with
a
finger
of
ecru
foam
though
not
carbonated
in
any
way
atop
a
dark
brownish
red
body
the
aroma
is
of
hops
caramel
and
clove
i
also
detect
a
hint
of
herbs
that
i
really
dont
know
the
origin
the
taste
is
pretty
darn
good
its
not
a
wow
beer
but
its
really
pretty
good
the
main
tastes
are
of
brown
sugar
clove
and
ginger
the
fact
that
this
beer
was
on
cask
made
it
all
the
better
the
mouthfeel
was
nice
even
though
it
was
warm
and
it
drank
like
bottled
water
oh
so
smooth
i
would
definitely
recommend
it
in
this
form
nice
to
see
this
on
cask
round
here
it
pours
a
clear
dark
amberbrown
topped
by
around
a
finger
or
so
of
dirty
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
brown
sugar
light
maple
syrup
nutmeg
walnuts
and
a
light
bit
o
wood
the
taste
holds
notes
of
light
roasted
malts
rye
bread
brown
sugar
flowers
corn
wheat
and
toffee
the
body
is
a
straight
medium
with
barely
any
carbonation
and
a
very
smooth
feel
overall
a
nice
bit
of
ale
something
that
could
in
caskconditioned
form
catch
on
if
offered
more
often
this
is
a
sixpack
beer
oh
how
luck
the
people
of
indiana
are
this
is
a
pretty
incredible
beer
to
be
put
into
sixpacks
of
12oz
bottles
one
of
my
very
favorite
scottish
ales
overall
fun
to
try
a
bottle
aged
a
year
but
it
really
didnt
make
that
big
of
difference
id
be
interested
what
a
couple
more
years
does
to
it
this
beer
is
too
nutty
for
my
preference
d
easy
to
drink
sits
well
with
the
palate
one
of
the
better
scottish
ales
to
have
with
a
meal
i
would
say
the
body
is
medium
to
mediumfull
with
a
pretty
low
carbonation
level
and
a
with
a
decent
residual
sweetness
all
of
these
combine
to
just
not
please
me
that
much
even
with
all
of
the
above
noted
problems
is
still
is
a
drinkable
beer
but
i
feel
like
it
could
be
improved
and
refined
into
something
much
better
poured
a
dark
clear
ruby
red
minimal
head
gone
in
seconds
nose
of
roasted
malt
and
slight
alcohol
aroma
am
i
imagining
peat
malt
taste
of
sweet
caramel
malt
up
front
mild
hops
at
the
finish
medium
body
with
mild
carbonation
decent
drinkability
this
went
superbly
well
with
a
shepards
pie
d
i
have
had
this
beer
before
when
i
wasnt
really
into
the
good
beer
so
i
guess
i
kinda
forgot
about
it
now
that
im
converted
to
the
good
beer
i
really
like
this
beer
and
will
get
it
again
this
is
a
great
beer
it
has
a
lot
of
flavor
with
a
fairly
low
abv
i
have
had
it
before
and
will
certainly
have
it
again
d
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
at
first
i
kept
thinking
how
much
it
tasted
like
a
brown
ale
and
wasnt
going
to
review
it
so
high
but
after
some
research
its
right
on
the
money
easy
to
drink
taste
great
wish
i
traded
for
more
d
this
beer
is
drinkable
but
not
something
i
would
really
seek
out
this
like
all
three
floyds
beers
have
just
failed
to
impress
me
but
are
still
drinkable
3
55
alright
but
this
one
needs
a
stronger
body
pours
a
very
hazlenutty
brown
color
with
a
small
tan
head
that
leaves
nice
lacing
for
its
style
aroma
is
caramelized
brown
sugar
raisin
and
some
figs
also
has
a
nice
malty
aromas
that
is
perfect
for
the
fall
the
flavor
is
big
time
caramelized
malts
almost
like
a
piece
of
raisin
bread
big
toffee
notes
followed
by
some
sweet
caramel
notes
there
is
a
nice
smokey
component
that
leaves
way
to
a
bran
like
cereal
note
the
mouthfeel
is
perfect
with
medium
carbonation
this
does
have
some
astringent
flavors
that
leave
the
palate
dry
and
a
bit
austere
i
really
like
this
the
second
time
around
may
e
its
the
fall
now
or
the
beer
came
to
its
own
but
this
is
really
good
i
poured
this
beer
from
the
bottle
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
the
smell
of
this
beer
is
very
enjoyable
to
me
the
first
thing
that
hits
nose
is
a
nice
whisky
smell
followed
by
carmel
coffee
and
fresh
wet
earth
the
color
is
a
nice
dark
golden
brown
with
just
a
little
quickly
dissipating
head
the
taste
of
this
beer
is
an
almond
and
carmel
with
a
coffee
and
wet
earth
finish
the
beer
really
changes
in
your
mouth
is
what
i
like
about
it
you
experience
all
the
different
changes
of
flavor
this
beer
is
full
of
nice
rich
flavors
but
also
light
and
earthy
enough
to
be
very
drinkable
i
can
never
go
wrong
with
a
robert
the
bruce
crimson
brown
color
with
a
small
head
that
did
not
last
long
before
settling
to
a
thin
layer
of
suds
just
a
little
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
rich
malty
aroma
hints
of
caramel
vanilla
a
little
fruit
and
some
wet
earth
the
flavor
is
not
as
impressive
as
the
aroma
but
it
is
still
a
good
example
of
the
style
mostly
caramel
with
a
slight
herbal
edge
in
the
finish
there
is
a
alcohol
flavor
at
the
finish
as
well
this
is
not
overly
sweet
which
is
a
good
thing
in
my
book
the
alcohol
in
the
finish
hurts
the
body
a
little
it
starts
off
as
having
the
sensation
of
being
thick
and
rich
until
the
alcohol
comes
in
and
it
seems
to
evaporate
the
beer
off
the
tongue
one
of
the
better
examples
of
a
somewhat
unexciting
style
of
beer
an
easy
drinker
overall
kinda
like
a
toned
down
barleywine
d
its
not
normal
is
the
fff
slogan
this
is
definitely
not
a
normal
scottish
ale
if
it
were
it
wouldnt
have
been
so
dang
drinkable
drinkability
i
enjoyed
this
one
it
was
bready
and
malty
sweet
but
didnt
become
too
cloying
for
me
i
could
handle
a
couple
three
a
night
doubt
i
could
have
more
than
2
in
a
sitting
the
combination
of
sweet
and
malty
along
with
it
being
medium
bodied
would
make
me
too
full
doubt
ill
pick
up
another
6
pack
of
this
but
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
if
offered
one
d
not
too
high
considering
three
floyds
isnt
distributed
out
here
if
it
were
available
to
me
all
the
time
id
probably
get
one
every
once
in
awhile
the
body
is
full
but
the
flavor
is
lacking
and
watery
so
it
is
confusing
to
drink
d
this
is
bready
malty
goodness
i
was
really
surprised
by
how
much
i
liked
this
beer
i
think
the
chewy
somewhat
sugary
breadiness
does
become
a
tad
tedious
but
all
in
all
this
beer
is
solid
robert
the
bruce
is
my
first
scottish
ale
and
i
like
it
however
being
a
big
fan
of
scotch
aleswee
heavy
i
miss
the
fullerbody
sweeter
heavier
caramel
and
roasted
malt
of
the
wee
heavy
drinkability
honestly
not
my
favorite
fff
beer
the
roast
malt
sweetness
isnt
quite
deep
enough
in
complexity
the
hops
are
too
pronounced
for
the
style
while
not
a
favorite
of
mine
its
certainly
not
a
bad
beer
and
definitely
not
normal
smooth
tasty
and
on
the
lighter
side
you
could
drink
a
few
of
these
easy
d
a
nice
ale
for
a
cold
day
serve
with
beef
or
lamb
stew
or
a
spicy
cigar
smoked
fish
with
capers
meatballs
maybe
lasagna
or
a
mac
and
cheese
poured
a
nice
deep
cherry
maroon
with
a
thin
white
head
spotty
lacing
hazy
and
somewhat
murky
nice
deep
caramel
and
brown
sugar
touch
of
molasses
but
lots
of
fruit
with
a
light
cocoa
dusting
sugar
plum
happiness
a
tinge
of
metallicness
that
kind
of
offsets
things
but
ill
forgive
rich
and
moderate
bodied
with
comfortable
carbonation
quite
drinkable
if
i
say
so
myself
review
from
notes
unfortunately
this
is
the
only
three
floyds
beer
at
the
store
i
visited
on
a
trip
to
indy
for
the
final
four
knowing
the
reputation
of
the
brewery
though
i
had
to
give
it
a
try
the
color
is
as
dark
as
can
be
while
still
being
able
to
see
the
ruby
red
glow
shining
through
the
middle
of
the
glass
a
onefinger
fizzy
head
forms
with
the
pour
but
it
disappears
after
a
few
minutes
leaving
only
the
dark
reddish
liquid
that
looks
like
a
glass
of
dr
pepper
the
aroma
is
grainy
but
in
a
more
positive
way
than
i
normally
use
that
term
with
an
underlying
caramel
sweetness
the
flavor
is
relatively
smooth
and
mild
but
is
still
quite
sweet
and
bready
especially
as
it
warms
the
texture
isnt
very
robust
with
only
a
very
fine
carbonation
saving
it
from
being
too
thin
yet
almost
syrupy
this
one
is
certainly
interesting
but
it
is
not
a
reason
for
me
to
want
three
floyds
to
expand
their
distribution
overall
solid
offering
and
scottish
ale
from
fff
i
like
the
flavor
balance
of
the
different
malts
with
todays
craft
beers
trying
to
make
the
biggest
and
baddest
dipas
and
a
balance
of
malt
and
hops
its
nice
to
get
a
beer
that
has
an
interesting
bouquet
of
malt
flavors
abv
is
not
too
high
if
you
like
scotch
ales
this
is
an
excellent
example
and
a
great
session
beer
d
good
drinkability
rounds
out
nicely
very
easy
to
go
back
for
another
sip
neat
to
try
but
prolly
wont
return
to
it
beer
is
simple
and
smooth
mostly
roast
in
the
back
of
the
mouth
not
much
else
happening
really
just
a
plain
ol
beer
drinkability
is
very
good
very
wellrounded
beer
poured
into
a
pint
glass
a
deep
brown
nearly
black
color
light
fluffy
one
finger
head
that
recedes
to
a
collar
some
really
nice
lacing
as
well
smell
is
mainly
malt
with
brown
sugar
and
coffee
undertones
taste
has
a
malty
almost
briney
like
characteristic
to
it
a
bit
sweet
as
well
reminds
me
of
brown
rock
sugar
mouthfeel
is
chewy
yet
light
i
could
have
a
lot
of
these
and
would
lve
to
try
this
on
tap
sometime
d
this
beer
does
not
have
the
overt
smokiness
that
some
scottish
ales
do
but
it
is
still
quite
delicious
d
a
great
all
around
scottish
style
ale
one
that
has
great
complex
flavors
with
the
slight
lack
of
creaminess
of
other
of
the
style
it
offers
a
better
drinkablity
crisp
on
this
brew
is
not
only
refreshing
for
all
season
drinking
but
it
could
play
into
the
part
of
the
complex
flavors
seek
out
great
brew
not
one
of
my
favorite
styles
but
this
beer
is
definitely
drinkable
i
like
the
roast
in
it
and
would
indeed
enjoy
a
pint
of
it
poured
from
a
341ml
bottle
into
a
tulip
bottle
courtesy
of
ajacob81
cheers
pours
a
deep
purpleburgundy
with
a
finger
of
tan
head
slowly
disappearing
to
just
a
collar
of
head
atop
took
a
whiff
form
the
bottle
and
got
some
hoppy
notes
but
pouring
this
out
little
hoppiness
comes
through
in
the
nose
very
malty
with
lots
of
raisin
grape
plum
and
other
dark
fruits
coming
through
bit
of
alcohol
in
there
too
taste
follows
the
nose
sweet
with
some
roasty
malt
and
a
tiny
bit
of
bitterness
in
the
finish
alcohol
is
there
but
not
at
the
forefront
by
any
means
mouthfeel
is
pretty
full
and
the
carbonation
is
medium
to
low
on
this
not
really
well
versed
in
scottish
ales
but
this
one
was
quite
decent
i
could
definitely
put
back
a
couple
of
these
drinkability
is
quite
good
good
but
not
great
beer
from
3f
d
for
a
scottish
ale
with
more
malt
kick
pretty
easy
to
drink
wont
buy
it
every
time
but
a
good
change
up
d
great
this
brew
goes
down
smooth
and
does
not
have
the
sweetness
overload
that
most
scotch
ales
are
plagued
by
this
is
easily
one
of
the
best
scottish
ales
ive
tried
aside
from
tasting
great
the
structure
is
most
impressive
this
bottle
has
been
sitting
in
the
fridge
for
several
months
i
have
no
idea
how
much
it
differs
from
a
fresh
bottle
but
its
fine
the
way
it
is
recommended
poured
a
slightly
dark
brown
that
has
a
dark
amber
color
when
held
up
to
the
light
not
a
very
big
head
on
this
one
i
smell
dark
fruits
and
a
little
bit
of
chocolate
i
also
get
some
roasted
malts
hmmmm
the
taste
is
very
interesting
a
bit
overly
sweet
though
i
get
prunes
raisins
and
plums
in
the
aftertaste
not
much
hop
character
but
a
strong
malt
profile
this
beer
has
candy
sugar
notes
all
over
my
palate
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
syrupy
but
not
too
bad
the
drinkability
is
not
very
high
considering
it
is
a
little
too
sweet
im
not
against
sweet
beers
but
this
has
too
much
of
a
sugary
taste
to
me
d
this
is
a
strange
one
6
5
is
considerable
but
really
nothing
for
both
this
styles
or
other
big
beers
either
way
there
is
a
sure
presences
of
alcohol
in
this
one
after
a
few
sips
i
only
have
three
but
ive
been
drinking
one
each
day
that
must
mean
something
not
what
youd
expect
from
a
scottish
but
still
enjoyable
d
ive
had
this
beer
a
couple
times
and
this
time
around
i
thought
was
a
little
tastier
due
to
the
freshness
glad
ii
got
to
campare
with
a
much
fresher
one
very
easy
to
drink
scottish
ale
lightly
sweet
has
a
somewhat
bitter
aftertaste
with
decent
carbonation
and
a
medium
body
overall
not
the
best
scottish
ale
i
have
had
d
the
beer
finishes
pretty
crisp
no
real
lingering
flavors
and
no
palate
fatigue
overall
a
decent
scottish
style
ale
edit
021412
had
another
bottle
of
this
tonight
bumping
the
nose
from
a
3
0
to
a
3
5
nose
has
a
lot
more
toasted
and
roasted
malts
to
it
and
some
nuts
pretty
nice
i
like
this
much
better
then
the
first
time
i
had
it
a
very
nice
effort
from
the
folks
at
3
floyds
bottle
thanks
to
mikesgroove
for
this
ubercool
extra
dark
but
clear
brown
colored
pour
aroma
is
quite
sweet
reminds
me
of
other
american
malt
bombs
like
alesmith
wee
heavy
it
leans
towards
molasses
some
candied
fruits
strawberry
and
also
some
peat
taste
is
quite
sweet
with
a
nice
peppery
touch
from
the
alcohol
palate
is
light
and
sessionable
some
alcohol
warmth
while
its
not
the
best
beers
ive
had
overall
i
just
couldnt
find
any
flaws
as
good
as
it
gets
for
a
thin
and
malty
brew
glad
i
rate
this
style
with
the
best
thanks
a
bunch
mike
it
is
a
great
start
meh
this
one
just
isnt
doing
it
for
me
it
is
drinkable
but
the
grainy
backbone
makes
this
one
a
little
on
the
weaker
side
one
of
these
is
enough
on
a
night
i
wouldnt
turn
one
of
these
down
but
id
not
buy
a
sixer
of
it
this
is
not
a
particularly
drinkable
style
to
my
tastes
but
this
is
perhaps
more
drinkable
than
average
something
beyond
an
introductory
scottish
but
not
quite
up
to
the
best
efforts
dbeing
my
first
3f
beer
i
definitely
enjoyed
this
one
i
would
consider
smuggling
one
back
to
ohio
in
my
checked
baggage
if
i
get
a
chance
to
stop
at
a
bottle
shop
on
my
way
to
the
airport
d
while
very
drinkable
its
a
bit
too
clean
for
the
style
it
reminds
me
more
of
a
brown
ale
than
a
scottish
ale
otherwise
it
does
taste
good
and
is
definitely
worth
a
try
d
robert
the
bruce
is
a
pretty
good
beer
ive
had
better
for
the
style
and
i
do
think
3f
does
a
much
better
job
per
style
with
some
of
their
other
beers
d
easy
to
enjoy
and
very
accessible
to
the
non
craft
drinker
good
stuff
glad
i
tried
it
i
would
pick
up
a
sixer
in
a
second
its
kinda
low
in
abv
which
calls
for
a
few
of
them
simple
not
outlandish
robert
comes
through
d
a
solid
beer
great
for
the
fall
months
when
the
leaves
are
falling
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
then
but
for
the
summertime
its
a
little
out
of
place
my
only
complaint
is
that
this
reminds
me
more
of
a
brown
ale
than
a
scottish
ale
in
my
opinion
smooth
carbonated
malty
mouthfeel
flavors
are
mild
and
not
really
complex
but
sweet
and
roasted
tobacco
and
char
flavors
are
light
but
noticable
the
warmer
this
beer
gets
the
better
it
tastes
very
drinkable
a
nice
solid
beer
from
fff
taste
sweet
with
only
the
slightest
hint
of
hop
bitterness
no
detectable
alcohol
and
a
smooth
maltiness
that
really
fills
out
the
medium
mouthfeel
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
flavors
are
middle
of
the
road
but
i
think
i
could
put
this
stuff
back
all
day
long
pours
a
deep
tannic
brown
with
a
light
creamy
head
that
dissipates
rapidly
lacing
is
almost
nonexistant
smells
strongly
of
roasted
malts
with
some
vanilla
and
toffee
in
the
background
taste
was
very
mellow
sweet
malt
with
a
slight
hop
kick
at
the
finish
some
heavy
carbonation
going
on
with
this
beer
light
mouthfeel
with
a
easy
drinkability
and
nice
abv
good
stuff
nice
offering
in
this
style
for
3f
drinkability
is
goodan
easy
to
drink
beer
but
very
malt
heavy
d
high
marks
here
as
the
taste
combined
with
the
low
abv
makes
for
a
beer
you
could
have
a
few
of
pours
a
dark
ruby
red
with
a
one
finger
light
tanwhite
head
good
lace
smells
of
robust
sweetness
grapes
chocolate
and
nutty
malt
the
taste
is
smokey
with
caramel
malt
solidly
backing
up
the
flavor
and
a
bit
of
sweet
chocolate
complimenting
it
nicely
again
robust
forward
and
bold
ending
with
a
candied
sweetness
and
soft
peat
mouthfeel
is
leaning
toward
light
and
slick
this
was
my
transition
beer
from
bmc
and
i
appreciate
it
to
no
end
md
medium
bodied
with
a
good
touch
of
carbonation
good
mouthfeel
and
good
drinkability
smooth
delicicous
beer
would
track
down
again
flavor
matches
the
nose
with
a
very
drinkable
balanced
finish
excellent
afternoon
beer
just
not
over
the
top
i
would
like
to
retry
this
in
the
bottle
as
the
3floyds
are
known
for
their
hops
which
are
not
dominant
here
off
the
cask
well
done
but
there
are
better
out
there
drinkability
not
bad
one
a
night
would
be
perfect
for
me
though
others
have
said
how
its
more
like
a
strong
brown
ale
which
the
mouthfeel
totally
gives
but
i
do
get
a
bit
of
earthy
peaty
notes
like
i
do
from
most
scotch
ales
a
pleasant
departure
from
the
hop
heavy
stuff
ive
been
drinking
lately
yes
there
are
other
beers
out
here
very
drinkable
even
with
the
higher
alcohol
content
received
this
sixer
as
a
gift
will
definitely
spend
my
own
on
more
from
three
floyds
d
this
is
an
extremely
drinkable
beer
in
my
opinion
so
smooth
and
subdued
i
wanted
to
stay
with
this
tonight
and
almost
did
this
is
my
first
beer
from
three
floyds
i
loved
it
d
if
it
werent
for
the
abv
id
say
this
beer
could
be
sessionable
the
feel
is
there
solid
but
not
thick
the
flavors
are
bold
but
not
overpowering
good
stuff
but
i
think
it
suffers
from
deflated
ratings
because
it
is
not
a
typical
three
floyds
hop
monster
overall
a
decent
scotch
ale
but
nothing
impressive
it
was
good
trying
it
but
i
wasnt
amazed
fairly
drinkable
if
i
wanted
to
drink
more
of
it
of
course
thanks
to
my
friend
diana
for
picking
this
up
for
me
pours
a
dark
copper
body
topped
by
a
beige
medium
sized
foamy
white
head
aromas
are
huge
malts
brown
sugar
biscuits
and
bread
candy
too
taste
is
sweet
brown
sugar
huge
malts
mild
smoke
notes
bready
earthy
good
finish
is
slightly
boozey
sweet
and
bitter
good
overall
example
of
a
scotch
ale
3f
does
it
again
pours
a
ruddy
dark
brown
without
much
head
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
malty
the
taste
is
slightly
smokey
but
mainly
its
just
a
malty
sweet
taste
relatively
clean
tasting
excellence
that
really
impresses
me
as
an
everyday
beer
form
a
brewery
that
seems
to
be
mainly
known
for
its
epic
beers
im
so
glad
this
is
now
available
in
ohio
after
being
unavailable
forever
d
i
have
a
growler
of
this
and
i
expect
it
to
be
gone
by
tomorrow
night
i
love
fff
having
growlers
now
at
party
town
in
florence
of
fff
is
a
dream
come
true
my
first
experience
with
three
floyds
has
been
a
good
one
i
look
forward
to
trying
more
of
their
offerings
recommended
searched
high
and
low
for
this
brewerys
stuff
and
finally
found
this
pours
deep
red
brown
with
tan
head
that
flattens
to
a
murky
surface
aroma
is
sweet
malts
light
roasted
malt
ripe
fruit
and
alcohol
deep
malt
complexity
with
a
roasted
malt
flavor
that
lingers
smooth
and
refined
with
no
afterbite
nice
middle
of
the
road
mouthfeel
light
hopping
to
balance
i
was
pumped
to
try
my
first
three
floyds
brew
and
i
was
not
let
down
looking
forward
to
scrounging
up
a
different
one
ive
had
this
on
tap
and
from
a
bottle
and
i
must
say
that
this
is
probably
my
least
favorite
fff
beer
thats
a
good
thing
though
since
this
guy
isnt
that
bad
a
dark
hazy
brown
in
the
glass
with
some
tan
head
that
sticks
around
a
while
smell
is
of
some
caramel
dark
fruit
a
hint
of
chocolate
and
something
that
i
can
only
describe
as
bockyness
typically
bocks
are
not
my
favorite
beers
due
to
something
in
the
malt
bill
that
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
i
know
thats
a
broad
claim
to
make
but
there
seems
to
me
to
be
the
same
quality
here
taste
follows
suit
with
some
nice
notes
of
chocolate
and
caramel
but
then
that
bock
flavor
hits
again
reminds
me
of
an
artificial
grape
flavor
really
little
or
no
hop
presence
to
be
noted
creamy
and
smooth
the
mf
isnt
bad
at
all
on
this
beer
and
drinkability
is
a
little
limited
by
the
fact
that
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
taste
i
can
see
why
people
like
it
and
technically
i
think
its
a
pretty
wellcrafted
beer
it
just
doesnt
appeal
to
me
that
much
the
amount
of
earth
and
sweetness
impede
the
drinkability
a
bit
a
good
beer
but
this
is
a
little
less
exciting
than
the
other
3floyds
beers
ive
had
after
sitting
unrefrigerated
in
my
garage
for
at
least
a
year
or
more
i
finally
rescued
this
one
for
a
try
and
boy
am
i
glad
i
caught
it
before
it
turned
on
me
it
showed
a
deep
ruby
mahogany
color
with
a
full
light
tan
head
and
good
lacing
the
aroma
is
simply
a
sublime
malt
with
a
hint
of
whiskey
really
great
the
flavor
is
very
smooth
malt
heavy
but
blended
so
nicely
with
a
mildly
hop
sweetness
theres
minor
alcohol
presence
with
good
drinkability
medium
bodied
a
beautiful
malt
experience
pours
a
lovely
dark
amber
brown
color
with
a
small
white
head
that
was
gone
quickly
and
no
lacing
lots
of
nice
aromas
coming
out
of
this
one
chocolate
lots
of
caramel
light
smoke
and
barely
any
hoppiness
taste
is
loaded
with
rich
caramel
light
chocolate
and
some
roastiness
little
to
no
bitterness
medium
mouthfeel
but
very
little
carbonation
an
all
around
enjoyable
and
drinkable
scotch
ale
overall
a
very
enjoyable
beer
maybe
not
100
to
style
in
some
areas
but
its
mostly
there
and
if
we
all
made
the
same
scotch
ale
then
all
of
them
would
be
boring
i
like
the
dryness
on
the
finish
i
like
the
extra
hop
presence
even
if
it
isnt
that
much
extra
its
fun
to
see
what
its
like
and
i
really
like
how
drinkable
this
beer
is
for
the
style
an
excellent
beer
would
love
to
try
the
barrel
aged
version
as
i
think
we
might
have
a
backwoods
bastardish
experience
a
very
nice
beer
dbetter
than
i
remember
this
is
a
very
pleasant
and
well
craft
brew
i
could
see
myself
putting
down
quite
a
few
of
these
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
side
with
moderate
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
i
really
liked
this
one
it
was
very
tasty
and
went
down
very
easy
i
would
definitely
buy
this
one
again
solid
scottish
ale
as
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
i
could
put
four
or
five
down
before
getting
tired
of
its
sweetness
this
one
pours
a
dark
brown
cokelike
with
a
34
head
leaving
big
lacing
all
the
way
smell
moderately
of
malt
and
tastes
moderately
of
malt
and
caramel
i
normally
dont
much
care
for
scottish
ales
as
they
tend
to
have
too
much
caramel
but
this
one
is
a
little
on
the
light
side
which
works
for
me
carbonation
is
about
right
and
its
very
drinkable
one
of
the
better
scottish
ales
ive
had
overall
well
done
scottish
ale
its
easy
to
overlook
the
bruce
with
all
the
amazing
brews
fff
has
to
offer
but
id
stack
this
up
against
any
other
scottish
ale
out
there
this
poured
a
clear
mahogany
with
almost
no
head
it
smelled
like
brown
sugar
and
rye
bread
and
roasted
barley
with
some
alcohol
it
tasted
like
roasted
barley
and
copper
hops
with
some
brown
sugar
and
a
bit
of
oak
it
was
slightly
thick
with
a
bit
of
carbonation
and
had
a
bitter
aftertaste
overall
this
was
a
pretty
good
scottish
ale
but
wasnt
one
of
my
favorites
it
had
a
clean
taste
but
the
malt
wasnt
terribly
rich
or
delicious
it
had
good
body
but
not
great
and
the
alcohol
was
noticeable
it
was
still
pretty
easy
to
drink
and
enjoy
but
was
unimpressive
d
pretty
drinkable
its
not
particularly
noteworthy
as
a
beer
but
it
is
definitely
easy
on
the
palate
first
review
notes
this
is
a
great
brew
when
you
get
a
hankering
for
malt
not
quite
as
good
from
the
bottle
as
it
is
ontap
but
still
one
thats
nice
to
have
around
often
surprisingly
it
has
a
little
more
kick
to
it
when
from
the
tap
while
many
beers
mellow
slightly
ontap
drinkability
is
very
high
this
is
great
for
the
style
fff
is
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
out
there
because
they
seem
to
be
able
to
nail
just
about
any
style
and
dont
shy
away
from
brewing
boring
styles
in
favor
of
ridiculous
huge
bal
aged
beers
good
job
guys
d
great
while
sweet
it
isnt
cloying
and
i
would
be
able
to
enjoy
another
of
these
the
smokypeat
character
whether
accomplished
by
the
yeast
or
malt
is
there
but
not
distracting
reminds
me
of
a
scottish
ale
with
a
german
alt
twista
tasty
creation
from
3f
dont
remember
where
this
bottle
came
from
but
i
suspect
bret27
pours
a
dark
brownish
amber
color
with
a
medium
beige
head
aromas
of
bread
crusts
and
caramel
simple
but
not
bad
flavor
is
similar
but
a
little
less
robust
than
the
aroma
toasty
with
a
hint
of
nuttiness
about
what
i
would
expect
for
my
first
scottish
ale
decent
tasting
scotch
but
could
use
a
bit
more
wow
like
it
a
lot
though
pours
a
clear
dark
brown
color
with
a
amber
hue
with
minimal
head
with
a
beige
ring
and
sticky
lacing
til
the
end
the
smell
was
toffee
caramel
malts
a
slight
roasted
coffee
smell
the
tatse
was
sweet
malts
caramel
and
toffeecoffee
it
was
very
good
maybe
a
little
to
sweet
for
the
style
the
mouthfeel
was
good
but
not
robust
as
i
like
it
was
a
tad
watered
down
this
is
still
a
delicious
brew
in
the
winter
or
with
a
meal
it
is
above
average
in
drink
ability
with
no
alcohol
detected
you
can
easily
knock
back
some
of
these
3fff
is
a
great
brewery
in
which
i
have
access
to
and
am
glad
to
hoist
their
brews
anytimeanywhere
di
have
been
a
fff
for
4
years
and
rtb
is
a
good
flagship
beer
to
pair
with
gumballhead
pride
joy
and
alpha
king
what
can
be
said
about
robert
the
bruce
that
he
cannot
say
himself
just
take
a
sip
and
get
lost
in
the
nearly
overpowering
flavor
explosion
and
the
creamy
tingly
mouthfeel
of
this
wondrous
scottish
ale
when
three
floyds
brews
a
beer
they
usually
do
it
right
and
rtb
is
no
exception
great
beer
to
start
the
night
off
or
to
pair
with
a
bigass
deep
dish
pizza
3
5
d
no
big
flaws
but
not
show
stopping
either
a
decent
brew
d
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
that
i
havent
had
in
a
little
while
and
was
a
pleasant
surprise
to
revisit
i
would
recommend
to
almost
anybody
edit
website
is
showing
thie
recent
batch
is
6
5
might
explain
the
thinness
d
quaffable
without
a
trace
of
the
7
abv
definitely
worth
a
try
overall
not
boldly
peaty
but
super
smooth
and
easy
drinking
very
good
beer
i
could
session
it
will
have
to
head
back
over
to
indiana
to
pick
up
some
more
of
this
through
the
holidays
taste
is
a
bit
watery
certainly
not
unpleasant
but
for
a
7
brew
i
am
shocked
by
how
little
flavor
is
here
there
are
small
amounts
of
biscuit
and
caramel
but
really
not
much
else
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
full
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
i
suppose
if
you
were
looking
for
a
slammable
7
percenter
than
this
would
be
a
good
choice
but
really
i
dont
see
the
point
of
this
beer
either
be
a
lower
alcohol
session
beer
or
come
with
a
little
more
flavor
to
reward
careful
drinking
nothing
groundbreaking
here
alas
but
this
is
very
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
and
a
good
take
on
the
style
i
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
my
sa
perfect
pint
glass
it
is
dark
caramel
with
reddish
highlights
a
decent
head
forms
and
does
not
stick
around
very
long
the
aroma
is
caramel
peat
maybe
smoke
the
flavor
follows
sweet
and
smokey
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
the
finish
is
dry
the
beer
is
smooth
and
creamy
this
is
a
beer
i
could
drink
all
night
drinkability
im
a
fan
of
scottish
ales
and
this
beer
transcends
the
category
its
a
fff
take
on
a
scottish
ale
as
one
of
their
least
hoppy
beers
it
shows
that
fffs
can
perform
more
than
adequately
when
they
must
constrain
themselves
to
a
more
traditional
style
pretty
easy
drinking
i
think
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
nothing
crazy
and
groundbreaking
just
a
solid
malty
scotch
ale
d
this
is
a
terrific
malty
brew
that
you
could
easily
have
6
of
before
you
knew
it
overall
not
the
usual
toe
curler
from
three
floyds
a
rather
drinkable
session
beer
nonetheless
i
really
enjoyed
this
good
flavors
and
nice
balance
served
with
a
medium
offwhite
head
and
no
lace
color
is
a
very
dark
amber
with
brown
highlights
aroma
is
very
malty
sweet
a
bit
roasty
a
hint
of
peat
caramel
toffee
and
nice
flavors
about
the
same
perhaps
with
a
touch
more
peat
body
is
perhaps
very
slightly
thin
and
good
carbonation
finish
is
pleasing
with
a
tad
bit
o
booze
nice
drinking
beer
seems
like
its
tamer
than
it
used
to
be
could
drink
this
regularly
for
sure
and
the
first
i
recall
having
in
the
scottish
ale
category
poured
a
deep
ruby
red
with
a
2
finger
light
tan
head
that
faded
fairly
fast
smells
roasty
caramel
fresh
coffee
tastes
very
malty
not
a
huge
fan
of
malty
beers
but
this
is
decent
for
the
style
i
wouldnt
seek
this
out
again
just
because
of
its
maltiness
d
a
good
sipping
beer
just
slightly
out
of
the
sessionable
range
not
incredibly
heavy
more
medium
i
would
say
although
despite
the
clingy
head
i
thought
the
carbonation
was
a
bit
on
the
flat
side
which
i
guess
isnt
that
horrible
considering
the
clean
malty
flavors
not
a
bad
scottish
ale
by
any
means
but
i
did
feel
it
to
be
lacking
in
the
flavor
area
particularly
with
the
clearly
evident
hoppiness
which
i
dont
particularly
like
to
find
in
my
scottish
ales
d
the
appearance
is
disappointing
to
begin
with
but
the
nose
is
right
and
inviting
the
flavor
coupled
with
the
mouthfeel
really
brings
the
glory
out
of
this
beer
rich
and
complex
its
worth
reveling
in
but
one
will
go
far
enough
for
me
good
finish
and
makes
me
thirsty
for
more
pours
a
pretty
dark
reddish
brown
with
practically
no
head
smell
is
toffee
molasses
and
toasted
malt
a
hint
of
chocolate
too
taste
is
more
toasted
malt
with
some
sweetness
in
the
back
then
again
more
toasted
malt
a
nice
balance
of
flavors
with
the
maltiness
and
sweetness
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
creamy
good
drinkability
a
delicious
brew
a
very
solid
beer
i
could
have
another
but
im
not
one
to
pound
back
scottishstyle
ales
notes
a
nice
overall
beer
that
has
good
balanced
elements
one
of
my
more
favorite
scottish
ales
i
like
the
big
malts
but
sometimes
it
can
be
overwhelming
does
a
good
job
of
being
both
malty
and
sweet
and
hoppy
without
covering
either
one
up
by
overcompensating
drinkability
is
impressive
alcohol
stays
tucked
away
and
hidden
flavors
are
rich
and
yet
balanced
complex
and
flavorful
very
nice
beer
the
brew
didnt
have
much
head
and
was
a
muddy
brown
colour
the
nose
was
quite
malty
but
still
had
a
good
amount
of
hop
in
it
the
taste
was
exactly
like
how
my
home
brew
tasted
so
maybe
theyre
doing
it
wrong
or
im
doing
it
right
the
hops
are
the
most
noticeable
thing
in
the
brew
they
seem
to
cut
right
through
the
medium
malt
body
the
alcohol
also
sneaks
up
on
you
overall
the
brew
is
a
good
one
but
nothing
of
which
i
would
want
to
have
too
much
d
drinkable
for
the
style
but
definitely
not
a
sessiontype
beer
and
doesnt
have
the
complexity
to
really
sit
and
savor
picked
this
one
up
incognito
at
a
nearby
bottle
shop
after
the
owner
returned
from
a
trip
to
chicago
i
never
picked
this
one
up
when
it
was
available
here
not
sure
why
poured
into
a
shaker
glass
rtb
appears
a
hazed
copper
color
with
about
an
inch
of
cream
light
rust
colored
foam
tastes
and
smells
of
molasses
caramel
malts
as
it
should
somewhat
fruity
biscuits
sweet
malty
toasted
bread
medium
in
both
body
and
carbonation
worth
a
try
if
you
like
scotch
ales
all
in
all
a
very
good
beer
im
not
a
huge
scottish
ale
drinker
but
this
was
a
great
example
of
one
and
id
readily
have
more
final
thoughts
i
think
everything
that
needed
to
be
said
was
said
kinda
sweet
more
like
a
porter
than
scottish
ale
kinda
big
alcohol
hit
with
spice
and
warmth
as
well
as
taste
deep
fruit
chocolate
roasted
malts
and
charred
earthy
tastes
very
complex
beer
that
needs
quite
a
few
sips
to
really
experience
it
i
better
keep
sampling
for
science
not
bad
but
fff
has
done
much
better
d
its
overwhelming
flavor
paired
with
its
medium
body
doesnt
lend
towards
a
very
drinkable
beer
but
its
certainly
good
i
would
drink
this
if
it
was
more
readily
available
but
not
if
something
like
alpha
king
or
moloko
were
available
as
well
drinkability
is
high
due
a
combination
of
good
taste
middle
of
the
road
abv
and
the
mouthfeel
this
has
a
good
mouthfeel
light
and
crisp
with
a
good
spicy
finish
drinkability
is
average
but
doesnt
mean
i
would
crack
open
another
one
of
these
the
sweetness
is
well
balanced
and
the
overall
taste
is
very
solid
bottle
thanks
to
flssmrbrewalum
pours
brown
with
a
small
ring
of
white
head
aroma
of
sweet
malt
nuts
and
peat
flavor
of
sweet
malt
some
vegetal
notes
this
is
the
top
scottish
ale
this
confirms
my
previous
opinions
about
scottish
ales
meh
i
enjoy
this
beer
and
it
meet
my
expectations
rich
but
not
so
much
that
a
2nd
would
be
out
of
the
question
well
done
decent
enough
but
there
are
much
better
examples
out
there
this
beer
is
strange
i
want
it
to
have
a
thicker
mouthfeelit
is
reminscent
of
really
water
syrup
howeverthis
beer
is
incredibly
easy
to
drink
its
really
quite
strange
this
beer
has
a
very
interesting
taste
almost
stoutish
by
mild
but
yet
at
the
same
time
a
very
big
mouthful
there
hints
of
tea
and
hops
at
the
end
this
beer
is
soso
couldnt
drink
a
ton
of
it
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
fairly
flat
the
only
real
unappealing
aspect
of
the
beer
recent
just
found
out
that
my
next
door
pub
has
a
great
selection
of
beer
on
tap
including
robert
the
bruce
and
i
must
say
that
on
tap
i
could
easily
give
this
beer
an
a
a
dark
brown
with
a
tiny
head
that
disappears
quickly
the
aroma
is
magnificent
malty
not
coffee
but
maple
syrup
the
taste
backs
up
the
smell
with
a
maple
sweetness
not
syrupy
though
very
nice
im
going
to
be
off
the
normal
curve
on
this
one
a
little
oily
on
the
mouth
feel
this
is
more
of
a
sipper
than
a
guzzler
pours
a
deep
redbrown
with
no
head
at
all
has
a
great
malty
roasty
nose
on
it
very
appealing
taste
is
really
malty
smooth
and
a
little
under
carbonated
but
its
quite
tasty
has
a
good
roasted
taste
that
lingers
i
think
this
is
really
quite
good
id
like
to
have
it
again
poured
to
a
nice
two
fingered
head
with
big
bubbles
head
was
a
darkish
white
in
color
brew
itself
was
dark
brown
kind
of
reminded
me
of
some
type
of
cola
drink
that
had
ice
cubes
in
it
had
some
lacing
just
not
a
lot
smelled
of
chocolate
alcohol
and
smoked
malt
i
thought
it
had
a
strong
chocolate
flavor
you
could
also
taste
that
smoked
malt
and
alcohol
i
thought
the
alcohol
taste
might
of
been
to
much
felt
heavy
in
the
mouth
that
might
of
been
from
the
smoked
malt
flavor
ive
had
a
few
fff
brews
and
i
thought
this
one
wasnt
typical
of
what
ive
had
from
fff
the
higher
alcohol
content
was
evident
you
would
have
to
be
carfull
with
this
one
i
couldnt
make
it
a
session
beer
overall
id
call
this
a
nofrills
scottish
drinkin
ale
perhaps
i
got
hold
of
an
old
bottle
but
the
flavors
just
didnt
seem
fresh
or
vibrant
to
me
however
the
taste
was
pretty
good
so
im
inclined
to
give
this
another
go
in
the
future
pretty
solid
otherwise
robert
the
bruce
is
an
okay
beer
and
the
smell
is
quite
tantalizing
still
i
expected
a
little
better
from
3fs
the
mouthfeel
in
particular
disappoints
it
seems
to
me
there
has
been
some
misstep
in
its
production
probably
wont
seek
it
out
again
this
is
the
first
scottish
ale
ive
ever
tried
and
i
must
say
i
definitely
picked
a
great
example
to
open
me
to
this
style
robust
flavorful
and
yet
delicate
and
mellow
in
the
flavors
that
peak
and
subside
with
each
sip
a
nice
choice
to
end
a
fantastic
evening
of
good
food
and
good
friends
a
rather
enjoyable
scottish
ale
great
on
cask
recommended
but
if
youre
a
malt
lover
this
is
your
shit
you
have
to
try
it
d
good
scottish
ale
not
a
favorite
style
of
mine
this
ale
is
definately
a
birdie
but
not
quite
an
eagle
d
abv
is
abit
high
to
make
this
a
session
but
the
flavor
and
relatively
small
body
would
make
for
a
at
least
a
couple
in
a
sitting
before
changing
it
up
highly
recommend
a
full
bodied
scottishstyle
ale
with
a
well
rounded
malty
profile
and
roasted
biscuitlike
notes

abv
parents
brought
me
a
couple
of
bottles
on
their
trip
here
from
indianpolis
poured
a
small
tan
head
that
continued
to
hold
up
deep
amber
in
color
with
ruby
highlights
aroma
is
big
time
caramelly
malt
a
little
biscuit
and
just
a
wee
bit
hint
of
peet
probably
from
the
yeast
flavor
is
big
time
malty
again
rich
caramel
and
slightly
biscuitty
medium
mouthfeel
finished
sweet
but
there
is
enough
hop
bitterness
to
keep
it
from
finishing
cloyingly
sweet
overall
a
very
nice
beer
i
will
buy
a
bunch
of
this
whenever
i
can
find
it
just
pick
up
a
sixer
and
enjoy
this
is
a
scotch
ale
at
its
finest
and
ive
had
many
richly
satisfying
and
a
rewarding
expierience
for
youre
taste
buds
to
enjoy
dont
miss
this
one
very
nice
another
great
fff
overall
give
me
another
very
smell
and
drinkable
a
big
thanks
to
sirsketch
for
sending
this
to
me
in
the
80s
bif
ok
so
let
me
review
ive
had
three
fff
beer
tonight
and
all
of
them
have
been
a
let
down
to
some
extent
i
dont
know
if
it
was
the
trip
down
here
or
maybe
im
being
a
little
harsh
because
of
all
the
hype
that
surrounds
this
brewery
i
have
a
bottle
of
dark
lord
stored
away
for
later
i
hope
its
not
as
disappointing
as
the
ones
ive
reviewed
tonight
thanks
go
out
to
beerad666
for
letting
me
try
these
brews
d
fine
example
of
a
scottish
ale
i
was
expecting
something
a
little
offkilter
from
fff
but
instead
i
was
treated
to
a
very
traditional
flavorful
ale
while
he
wasnt
much
to
look
at
robert
the
bruce
proved
to
be
a
tasty
malty
brew
that
is
a
worthy
flagship
ale
from
fff
overall
this
is
a
very
good
scottish
ale
it
is
well
balanced
smooth
and
quite
easy
to
drink
i
will
definitely
keep
my
eyes
open
for
it
d
this
is
my
first
scottish
ale
if
i
didnt
know
what
it
was
i
might
guess
dopplebock
good
thing
i
like
dopplebocks
i
spent
more
time
smelling
this
than
actually
drinking
i
was
surprised
at
the
detection
of
alcohol
but
it
didnt
detract
from
the
experience
it
was
easy
to
drink
but
i
could
see
this
becoming
too
sweet
after
a
while
this
would
really
hit
the
spot
on
a
cold
winter
night
d
a
good
beer
but
much
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
i
could
probably
force
another
beer
down
if
i
had
to
but
id
rather
switch
to
something
a
little
lighter
on
the
palate
i
was
hoping
for
a
fff
twist
on
this
beer
thinking
there
might
be
a
higher
dosage
of
hops
than
the
average
scottish
ale
but
they
most
certainly
were
not
there
d
this
is
a
good
beer
but
i
do
prefer
dirty
bastard
to
this
not
a
bad
scottish
ale
but
nothing
extraordinary
brown
in
color
kind
of
on
the
drab
side
not
very
exciting
the
basic
characters
are
there
nice
peat
and
slightly
smoky
malty
and
a
bit
nutty
but
nothing
really
jumps
out
and
grabs
me
i
tend
to
prefer
drier
beers
but
for
a
scotch
ale
im
really
looking
for
that
malty
robust
sweet
flavor
and
this
one
isnt
giving
it
to
me
not
much
in
the
way
of
spicy
hops
either
which
wouldnt
have
hurt
however
this
was
a
nice
and
mellow
brew
maybe
i
just
wasnt
in
the
mood
d
this
is
a
very
drinkable
scotch
ale
this
is
a
good
malty
brew
to
pick
up
in
a
sixer
if
you
just
want
a
sweet
beer
that
can
kick
back
and
have
few
of
in
a
sitting
the
slightly
thinner
body
does
help
with
the
drinkability
making
this
go
down
pretty
easy
i
would
absolutely
seek
this
out
if
it
was
available
nearby
as
a
regular
beer
in
my
beer
fridge
just
a
good
flavor
that
really
stays
with
you
dig
it
d
there
are
only
a
handful
of
scottish
ales
that
i
can
drink
more
than
one
of
this
is
one
of
those
the
flavors
are
big
but
not
overpowering
pours
a
clear
dark
amber
color
14
inch
head
of
a
pale
tan
color
decent
retention
and
poor
lacing
smells
of
roasted
malt
sweet
malt
and
some
coffee
aromas
fits
the
style
of
a
scottish
ale
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
thick
with
a
low
carbonation
level
tastes
of
roasted
malts
up
front
slight
hop
background
sweet
malts
an
almost
toffee
flavor
and
then
a
smooth
roasted
malt
finish
wow
for
all
the
malt
crammed
in
this
brew
it
is
still
very
easy
to
drink
almost
deceptively
so
overall
this
beer
doesnt
have
a
very
good
appearance
but
makes
up
for
it
in
flavor
ill
confess
that
im
not
a
big
fan
of
scottish
ales
in
general
so
take
my
comments
in
that
context
i
find
them
a
bit
too
sweet
but
i
liked
the
bruce
pretty
well
because
it
tastes
good
my
complaints
are
that
the
body
was
a
bit
thin
and
i
coundnt
raise
a
head
no
matter
how
badly
i
abused
it
during
the
pour
otherwise
the
appearance
etc
is
about
what
youd
expect
as
i
said
before
it
tastes
good
d
while
i
prefer
the
flavor
of
dirty
bastard
this
balanced
offering
from
fff
is
certainly
a
thirst
quenching
scottish
ale
this
is
far
more
sessionable
than
some
other
similar
beers
drinkability
very
high
the
flavors
are
very
bold
but
wellbalanced
and
complimentary
i
love
three
floyds
so
there
may
be
a
little
brand
bias
here
but
i
enjoy
this
beer
more
and
more
every
time
i
have
it
im
surprised
the
overall
score
of
this
beer
isnt
higher
if
you
like
scottish
ales
one
of
my
favorite
styles
youll
love
this
beer
md
rather
thin
mouthfeel
but
ridiulously
easy
drinking
a
touch
more
carbonation
would
be
good
poured
from
12oz
bottle
into
pint
glass
pours
a
deep
dark
red
color
with
a
half
finger
of
head
that
dissipates
quickly
leaving
just
a
ring
of
bubbles
around
the
rim
of
the
glass
smells
oaky
and
kind
of
bourbony
taste
is
very
smooth
and
oak
flavored
in
my
opinion
mediumbodied
mouthfeel
that
covers
the
tongue
and
leaves
a
malty
taste
on
the
tongue
very
drinkable
i
finished
the
glass
within
ten
minutes
with
no
problem
and
wanted
another
another
phenomenal
beer
from
three
floyds
drinkability
im
enjoying
this
one
could
probably
have
2
maybe
3
in
one
sitting
im
not
well
versed
in
scottish
ales
but
i
will
definitely
have
to
try
some
more
i
will
buy
this
one
again
d
i
have
tried
several
scottish
ales
before
and
i
have
to
say
this
is
by
far
my
favorite
first
ale
i
have
had
which
i
can
definitely
tell
has
a
very
bready
taste
nice
flavor
and

content

highly
recommended
poured
a
dark
brown
body
with
a
minimal
head
and
some
lace
patches
roasted
and
toasted
malts
in
the
smell
along
with
some
dark
fruit
and
hints
of
sugary
sweet
malts
mediumbodied
but
still
a
little
thick
and
viscous
at
times
this
was
a
mostly
sweet
brew
with
some
sour
notes
for
balance
sweet
malts
like
caramel
and
bready
malts
make
this
a
sipper
and
it
passes
over
with
a
moderate
malt
flavor
and
finishes
smooth
i
didnt
even
notice
the
abv
until
this
beer
warmed
i
nursed
this
one
and
picked
me
up
a
little
i
could
sip
on
this
again
some
slow
night
overall
impression
this
beer
has
a
nice
level
of
complexity
for
such
a
light
bodied
beer
if
you
enjoy
smoky
nutty
grainy
aromas
and
flavors
you
will
be
quite
the
fan
of
this
beer
i
have
to
admit
as
i
slowly
sipped
the
pint
it
did
start
to
grow
on
me
however
the
slight
alcohol
kick
still
tweaks
me
a
bit
its
definitely
worth
trying
if
youre
a
fan
of
scotch
ales
but
i
honestly
think
three
floyds
makes
better
beers
the
appearance
of
the
beer
is
a
very
dark
copper
colour
with
a
nicely
coloured
white
head
about
an
inch
in
height
with
a
lingering
nice
fluffy
head
the
beer
looks
like
a
quite
nice
scottish
ale
smelling
this
beer
is
quite
different
than
i
expected
i
get
quite
a
bit
of
chocolate
flavours
and
a
slight
bit
of
roastiness
but
not
much
melanoidins
no
hops
at
all
which
is
good
the
flavour
is
incredibly
malty
and
sweet
there
is
a
huge
amount
of
sweetness
coming
form
the
malts
but
there
is
a
chocolate
flavour
that
comes
out
near
the
end
there
isnt
a
complexity
to
this
beer
as
i
would
expect
but
a
great
solid
sweet
flavour
with
a
very
small
hint
of
chocolate
it
has
a
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
that
aids
the
sweetness
in
the
beer
there
is
also
a
nice
sweetness
if
i
was
in
the
mood
for
scottish
ales
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
drinkability
id
say
moderate
for
this
the
abv
is
a
little
on
the
higher
side
and
the
sweetness
is
too
much
for
personal
preference
however
with
that
being
said
ill
openly
admit
that
scotch
ales
arent
in
my
alltime
favorite
styles
but
i
feel
this
beer
is
a
great
and
true
representative
of
the
style
d
a
great
drinking
flavorful
beer
that
id
go
back
to
maybe
to
big
for
a
session
beer
but
definitely
worth
keeping
around
not
a
bad
beer
just
very
average
md
overall
i
really
like
this
one
im
not
a
fan
of
most
scotch
ales
but
this
one
is
subtle
and
it
makes
it
very
appealing
d
like
i
said
before
it
seems
light
for
the
style
but
theres
enough
flavor
there
to
make
this
an
enjoyable
beer
that
i
could
easily
put
more
than
a
few
away
in
a
night
it
has
a
smoked
nut
taste
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
in
the
back
of
the
throat
very
very
burnt
flavor
perhaps
too
burnt
for
my
taste
the
aftertaste
is
quite
sour
not
a
repeat
buy
at
10
a
sixer
not
unpleasant
to
drink
but
wow
theres
so
much
else
thats
so
much
better
at
this
price
finds
a
bad
middle
ground
where
its
too
heavy
to
session
and
not
interesting
enough
to
want
to
sip
on
for
a
while
i
kind
of
kept
wanting
this
to
be
a
scotch
ale
and
that
my
have
been
a
source
of
my
middling
reaction
here
poured
into
a
pint
with
a
deep
glowing
coffee
color
with
medium
rough
head
that
left
only
a
little
lacing
throughout
i
dont
normally
love
scottish
ale
its
the
peat
but
the
nose
of
this
is
dominated
by
malt
and
a
burnt
sugar
sweetness
the
taste
is
likewise
light
on
peat
heavy
on
the
toated
malt
and
sugar
a
spicy
toffee
rules
over
very
thin
hops
and
a
hint
of
smoke
a
surprising
aftertaste
of
scotch
whisky
followed
me
all
evening
medium
body
with
significant
carbonation
tends
to
cover
some
lack
of
depth
while
its
one
of
the
best
to
my
taste
scottish
ales
ive
had
i
wouldnt
see
this
as
one
to
drink
all
night
or
after
the
snow
melts
pours
dark
copper
with
a
thick
and
foamy
off
whitetan
head
flavorful
and
powerful
aroma
tastes
a
little
nutty
seet
and
oak
the
hops
seem
a
little
overpowered
by
the
alchohal
which
might
be
right
on
for
the
stlye
still
smooth
and
easy
going

great

i
really
enjoyed
the
balance
on
this
one
good
beer
but
feel
like
this
growler
fill
is
lacking
a
little
carbonation
not
sure
if
that
is
the
style
or
my
particular
growler
i
do
remember
enjoying
this
slightly
more
a
few
months
ago
from
the
bottle
d
i
like
this
beer
quite
a
lot
im
drinking
it
for
the
the
first
time
and
already
im
sure
itll
go
into
my
buying
rotation
heavy
for
a
session
beer
though
egészségedre
definitive
of
the
scotch
ale
style
to
me
ive
had
and
enjoyed
a
handful
of
others
and
they
tend
to
exhibit
the
characteristics
of
this
one
all
malt
sweet
with
a
very
particular
tartness
that
ive
only
found
with
this
style
i
suppose
its
the
peat
or
what
have
you
thats
supposed
to
be
in
scottish
ales
but
i
can
tell
you
that
its
good
not
the
most
drinkable
beer
in
the
world
but
a
great
sipper
p
s
the
guy
on
the
label
looks
like
the
bastard
child
of
a
scottish
king
and
a
russian
nutcracker
doll
i
used
to
have
this
periodically
before
3f
stopped
distributing
to
oh
i
just
picked
up
some
more
from
chicago
over
the
holidays
the
beer
is
dark
red
brown
with
a
real
thin
head
the
aroma
is
malty
and
roasty
kind
of
bocky
same
with
the
taste
very
sweet
malty
flavors
a
longlasting
sweetness
in
the
aftertaste
very
little
hops
in
the
flavor
scottish
ales
arent
really
my
thing
but
this
one
is
very
good
d
a
decent
scotch
ale
but
i
feel
it
could
be
more
flavorful
d
i
think
this
would
be
a
nice
beer
but
for
me
the
bittersweet
balance
wasnt
right
so
one
in
a
sitting
was
just
right
for
me
i
am
no
expert
on
scottish
ales
but
i
did
like
this
one
more
than
others
i
have
tried
in
the
past
nice
quality
beer
this
pours
a
reddish
brown
with
caramel
colored
edges
the
light
brown
cap
is
a
shade
darker
than
tan
and
about
two
fingers
tall
little
to
no
lacing
is
left
behind
as
the
cap
drops
to
a
thin
band
around
the
edges
the
nose
is
caramel
malts
with
just
a
hint
of
citrus
and
leathernot
a
huge
nosebut
a
pleasant
one
for
sure
caramel
malts
are
the
backbone
supporting
roasted
nutty
notes
and
and
subtle
whiskey
flavors
some
citrus
hoppiness
peeks
midway
and
provides
a
sweet
and
slightly
bitter
challenge
to
the
sweet
caramel
malt
that
would
otherwise
have
full
control
a
medium
to
full
body
with
very
active
carbonation
and
sugary
sticky
lip
coating
quality
i
enjoy
lingering
sweetness
and
this
one
fails
to
keep
it
going
for
more
than
a
few
secondsmy
only
complaint
good
drinkability
for
a
scotttish
alewish
i
had
two
more
md
medium
body
i
thought
that
it
was
going
to
be
thicker
than
it
actually
was
good
carbonation
level
and
very
easy
to
drink
but
probably
would
not
want
to
drink
to
many
at
one
setting
the
alcohol
was
not
really
noticeable
this
is
a
beer
that
i
will
pick
up
from
time
to
time
when
i
am
in
the
mood
for
it
overall
one
of
the
most
drinkable
scottish
ales
and
a
tasty
pick
drinkability
a
solid
beer
and
a
good
scottish
ale
not
my
favorite
of
the
3fs
ive
tried
thus
far
in
my
journey
but
a
good
beer
nonetheless
the
alcohol
is
not
unreasonable
nor
easily
detected
and
the
flavors
are
interesting
and
wellbalanced
enough
to
make
this
one
pretty
darn
drinkable
d
moderately
high
fairly
low
abv
and
not
a
strong
beer
not
my
favorite
style
so
most
likely
not
sessionable
imo
taste
is
caramel
some
heavy
malt
and
some
more
dark
fruit
this
is
very
creamy
and
smooth
on
the
mouthfeel
would
like
to
see
a
bit
more
carbonation
but
the
flavor
is
very
nice
good
solid
regular
offering
from
fff
d
a
nice
take
on
the
style
nice
and
easy
drinking
for
the
abv
and
for
the
style
which
is
usually
a
real
sipper
for
me
overall
a
pretty
good
drinker
though
nothing
to
go
crazy
about
drinkability
is
good
this
is
a
smooth
and
mild
scotch
ale
with
a
nicely
proportioned
profile
and
a
great
malt
complexity

hv
d
this
beer
seems
to
get

a

when
people
talk
about
good
beers
from
fff
a
great
asertive
balenced
and
delicious
beer
here
great
fall
beer
and
among
the
best
american
examples
i
have
ever
tried
this
is
a
very
good
beer
though
it
does
not
hit
the
spot
as
far
as
scottish
ales
go
that
being
one
of
my
favorite
styles
i
am
a
bit
more
harsh
on
my
review
if
it
had
more
peat
flavor
this
might
be
one
of
my
favorites
of
the
style
similar
to
a
scottish
gruit
style
brew
d
it
was
a
truely
wonderful
scottish
ale
very
well
balanced
yet
complex
it
may
be
a
bit
much
for
a
session
beer
but
i
think
it
could
stand
up
well
over
a
moderate
session
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
deep
reddish
brown
color
with
a
thinnish
white
head
that
quickly
dissipates
to
wisps
on
top
with
spotty
lace
on
the
way
down
smells
mostly
of
caramelized
sugars
with
hints
of
alcohol
raisins
and
prunes
sweet
and
malty
with
enough
hops
to
keep
it
from
cloying
sweet
dark
and
caramelized
sugars
mixed
with
some
dark
dried
fruits
with
just
enough
hop
and
ethanol
to
keep
it
from
cloying
medium
to
thick
body
with
a
light
to
moderate
level
of
carbonation
and
a
sweet
sticky
bubbly
mouthfeel
wow
this
seems
like
a
very
different
beer
than
the
one
i
reviewed
in
2008
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
this
time
i
guess
the
last
time
i
tried
this
maybe
i
got
one
that
was
off
i
think
this
is
my
first
scottish
ale
one
of
my
friends
gave
it
to
me
a
little
while
back
but
he
really
didnt
have
too
much
to
say
about
it
overall
it
seems
like
a
very
dark
strong
beer
other
than
the
pine
character
there
doesnt
seem
to
be
too
much
else
other
than
the
mild
bitterness
however
it
compliments
it
well
so
i
cant
knock
it
too
much
take
it
for
what
its
worth
try
it
if
you
can
but
dont
be
too
sorry
if
you
cant
maybe
not
three
floyds
best
ever
but
a
decent
stab
at
the
style
needs
something
that
i
cant
really
identify
to
make
it
really
wow
the
tastebuds
maybe
they
could
ramp
up
the
creamy
sweetness
and
the
peat
just
make
it
bigger
like
most
of
their
best
beers
but
then
it
wouldnt
have
the
considerable
nuances
a
scottish
ale
must
have
and
as
always
with
fff
an
absolutely
great
label
d
this
is
a
dangerously
drinkable
ale
for
the
abv
my
only
complaint
is
that
it
was
a
bit
too
thin
but
otherwise
all
around
a
fine
ale
pours
a
deep
amber
copper
color
with
a
small
off
white
head
in
the
aroma
roasty
sweet
and
a
small
peetiness
in
the
taste
caramel
small
hops
and
a
small
peet
like
spice
a
small
bite
with
a
medium
to
big
mouthfeel
and
a
semi
dry
caramel
like
aftertaste
a
great
scottish
ale
nice
caramel
flavor
overall
im
glad
i
had
the
chance
to
try
this
fff
offering
i
wont
seek
it
out
again
but
if
youre
in
the
mood
to
roll
your
rs
and
say
wee
a
lot
give
it
a
shot
overall
its
not
the
best
beer
three
floyds
makes
but
its
definitely
very
solid
and
tastes
damn
good
ive
had
it
on
tap
and
it
seemed
to
be
a
bit
smokier
and
better
tasting
overall
pours
deep
copper
with
a
small
offwhite
head
that
dissipates
quickly
to
a
collar
leaving
only
traces
of
lacing
smell
is
grainy
up
front
with
a
big
caramel
malt
backbone
and
sweet
toffee
on
top
taste
starts
with
the
grain
as
well
and
gives
way
to
the
caramel
and
chocolate
malts
there
is
an
underlying
molasses
sweetness
that
lingers
through
the
finish
as
well
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
sticky
with
fairly
low
carbonation
this
is
a
very
good
scottish
ale
and
one
i
would
seek
out
this
beer
has
a
great
deep
brown
coloring
light
has
the
slightest
trouble
trying
to
escape
the
smell
is
very
subtle
but
there
are
slight
nutty
aromas
when
this
beer
hits
the
tongue
is
when
it
all
comes
together
the
texture
is
very
heavy
surprisingly
creamy
compared
to
how
it
looks
there
are
notes
of
vanilla
and
oak
easy
to
drink
more
than
one
d
a
little
too
sweet
to
have
more
than
one
d
pleasant
taste
great
balance
light
body
im
sure
i
could
have
several
of
these
in
one
sitting
drinkability
fairly
tasty
but
i
am
missing
the
peaty
complexity
i
would
expect
from
a
good
scottish
ale
aroma
is
a
potpourri
of
caramel
malt
toasted
grains
fig
toffee
wonderful
and
those
are
the
flavors
that
dominate
plus
a
hint
of
tart
citrus
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
basically
big
malt
flavor
in
each
smooth
creamy
mouthful
i
love
scottish
ales
and
this
is
certainly
a
fine
one
d
an
amazing
scotch
ale
i
will
definitely
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
likes
malts
brews
very
subtle
for
7
this
was
a
good
beer
that
i
would
probably
limit
my
consumption
if
drinking
while
out
but
worth
a
shot
at
polishing
off
the
growler
at
home
even
with
help
we
backed
off
in
order
to
save
some
for
the
next
day
d
goes
down
fairly
easier
but
i
was
hoping
for
more
from
a
fff
beer
overall
not
a
bad
scotch
ale
at
all
not
my
favorite
for
the
style
or
from
three
floyds
but
still
a
very
solid
effort
overall
if
this
were
available
locally
i
would
have
no
issue
with
trying
to
track
down
some
more
of
it
it
was
very
solid
drinkability
is
moderate
alcohol
is
relatively
low
and
flavors
are
alright
so
its
fairly
easy
to
consume
taste
mouthfeel
tons
of
malt
again
very
similar
to
the
nose
caramel
and
toast
slight
alcohol
hints
of
dried
fruit
not
much
of
a
change
in
flavor
from
start
to
finish
medium
in
body
and
carbonation
this
stuff
goes
down
pretty
easy
but
isnt
overly
interesting
still
a
very
good
brew
and
one
id
gladly
drink
again
i
liked
this
beer
its
one
of
the
better
scottish
ales
ive
had
d
although
7
isnt
really
considered
session
material
this
would
still
be
great
during
a
night
of
cards
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
and
doesnt
sit
heavy
on
the
palate
or
over
work
your
taste
buds
poured
a
deep
reddish
brown
with
an
offwhite
head
that
settled
down
rather
quickly
smeel
of
caramel
and
fresh
bread
taste
backs
up
the
smell
almost
identically
very
heavy
on
the
caramel
malt
taste
clean
mouthfeel
with
little
to
no
aftertaste
very
easy
to
drink
and
very
good
beer
to
introduce
to
people
who
are
hesitant
to
try
craft
beers
d
i
didnt
find
this
beer
interesting
enough
to
buy
a
sixpack
it
is
easy
enough
to
drink
but
too
expensive
to
be
worth
it
very
interesting
beer
still
have
two
left
so
ill
be
looking
forward
to
them
the
same
goes
for
the
taste
its
smooth
pleasant
nice
and
malty
but
this
is
far
from
overwhelming
its
nice
the
mouthfeel
is
a
good
assist
with
the
creaminess
adding
a
nice
finish
to
robert
the
bruce
im
more
than
willing
to
admit
that
scottish
ale
is
not
my
favorite
style
representatives
tend
to
be
nice
and
malty
but
not
very
complex
this
needs
a
flavor
boost
diverse
and
bolder
malt
selection
would
do
wonders
for
a
nice
steady
beer
on
the
whole
pretty
good
not
everything
i
had
been
hoping
for
very
drinkable
great
brew
im
going
to
buy
more
of
these
so
that
i
can
pound
them
down
robert
the
bruce
is
a
pretty
straight
forward
scottish
ale
without
any
normal
crazy
3floydish
standout
qualities
it
is
decent
but
does
not
rival
most
of
this
brewerys
other
offerings
theres
a
subtle
hop
smell
and
taste
but
theres
a
good
smokey
taste
to
it
thats
not
overpowering
theres
a
rich
toffee
and
nutty
smooth
and
creamy
but
big
body
theres
a
hint
of
smoke
and
chocolate
on
the
finish
this
goes
down
easy
and
the
subtleness
of
the
abv
makes
this
a
sessionable
beer
d
a
very
nice
brew
that
i
could
put
a
few
done
of
alcohol
is
hidden
very
well
and
this
brew
is
very
tastey
copper
to
maroon
color
with
some
light
lacing
and
a
lasting
beige
head
transluscent
beer
smells
of
signature
three
floyds
hops
moreso
at
first
and
fades
into
a
light
but
pleasant
mild
peaty
maltiness
taste
is
smooth
mild
maltiness
with
some
tartness
and
a
touch
of
peat
pretty
tame
flavor
overall
i
thought
this
one
is
still
pretty
drinkable
but
not
to
remarkable
i
thought
good
for
a
style
im
not
fond
of
i
guess
d
a
good
beer
didnt
do
anything
special
for
me
but
i
surely
enjoyed
it
d
it
seems
like
fffs
interpretations
of
a
scottish
ale
but
not
particularly
to
style
drinkability
is
high
this
is
a
very
nuttytasting
brown
ale
with
muted
aromas
and
fair
texture
easy
drinking
and
masked
alcohol
presence
at
7
great
session
brown
ale
that
lacks
some
of
the
boldness
seen
in
other
fff
beers
drinkability
is
very
high
im
pleasantly
surprised
as
usually
i
keep
reaching
for
more
of
this
at
how
easy
it
is
going
down
i
very
much
am
enjoying
this
beer
medium
body
with
a
light
tangy
feel
good
drinkable
beerjust
not
interesting
enough
for
mehave
had
a
lot
of
better
beers
of
this
style
im
hoping
i
received
a
bad
bottle
it
was
the
last
on
the
shelf
because
other
than
its
flatness
this
was
a
very
tasty
brew
not
one
of
three
floyds
best
efforts
but
still
pretty
good
expected
it
to
be
more
aggressive
as
far
as
taste
goes
friend
rants
and
raves
about
the
barrel
aged
version
he
had
on
tap
back
east
recommended
if
you
are
a
fan
of
scottish
ales
but
not
worth
the
price
i
paid
for
it
another
treat
from
three
floyds
comes
off
as
an
imperial
esb
definitely
recommended
d
overall
i
found
this
to
be
a
big
disappointment
esp
given
the
other
beers
that
ive
had
from
3f
it
was
not
too
complex
and
rather
watery
which
makes
it
easy
to
drink
a
lot
of
but
not
really
makes
me
desire
to
go
and
drink
a
ton
of
these
it
does
have
a
cool
label
though
as
all
3f
do
id
put
it
in
the
categories
of
beer
that
i
would
maybe
buy
for
a
party
or
to
get
drunk
off
of
because
it
is
so
light
but
not
one
id
really
relish
sip
after
sip
maybe
have
to
try
it
again
to
see
if
it
was
just
the
bottle
i
had
this
time
or
something
robert
the
bruce
pours
a
murky
lightbrownamber
sort
of
hue
without
much
flourish
not
much
foam
the
head
falls
fairly
quickly
and
leaves
and
a
thick
collar
of
foam
with
some
minimal
but
thick
lacing
the
bruce
has
a
big
malt
aroma
with
heavy
caramel
toffee
accented
with
raisins
tastes
of
heavily
caramelized
malt
but
not
burnt
mixed
with
dried
fruit
hops
have
got
to
present
but
theyre
certainly
not
making
themselves
known
in
this
beer
this
beer
has
a
rather
viscous
mouthfeel
and
full
body
if
this
to
be
called
scottish
and
not
scotch
ale
it
is
definitely
a
90shilling
or
more
much
thicker
than
i
remember
but
thats
alright
overall
this
is
a
bit
of
at
hick
malt
bomb
i
dont
dare
to
think
of
the
calories
but
a
relatively
enjoyable
one
i
would
drink
this
again
but
only
winter
or
only
wet
cold
day
this
ale
is
a
bit
of
out
balance
while
90
and
120
schilling
scotish
ales
should
have
a
prounounced
maltiness
they
should
not
be
cloying
the
cloying
sweetness
detracts
from
both
the
taste
and
drinkability
d
very
drinkable
one
of
the
litter
scotch
ales
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
drinking
could
put
down
a
few
of
these
bad
boys
poured
dark
brown
what
little
head
accumulated
faded
almost
immediately
good
smell
aromas
of
dark
chocolate
slight
sting
taste
of
alcohol
slight
cranberry
taste
roasted
nuts
decent
beer
good
alcohol
content
nothing
special
d
extremely
drinkable
and
its
a
damn
shame
i
cant
get
that
stuff
on
a
regular
basis
here
i
could
drink
a
couple
of
these
but
even
after
one
i
feel
like
hops
are
growing
on
the
back
of
my
palate
and
tongue
would
be
hard
to
drink
more
than
1
or
2
at
a
time
tops
drinkability
very
drinkable
beer
the
lowish
abv
helps
as
does
the
smoothness
of
the
beer
very
good
beer
that
does
not
overpower
but
has
a
nice
taste
you
could
drink
several
of
these
in
a
sitting
d
a
little
too
sweet
for
me
drinkability
this
is
a
beer
your
drink
slowly
and
enjoy
i
grabbed
a
sixpack
and
poured
this
dude
into
a
tall
pom
glass
due
to
a
lack
of
pint
glasses
at
my
house
the
bottle
itself
is
a
work
of
art
and
the
beer
isnt
far
behind
for
being
a
higher
abv
beer
it
went
down
pretty
smooth
one
of
my
favorite
tf
beers
mmmmm
t
a
nicely
balanced
brew
that
has
a
dominate
malt
character
the
malt
is
very
toasty
with
hints
of
caramel
and
burnt
chocolate
as
the
alcohol
warms
a
mild
hop
character
helps
keep
this
beers
balance
in
check
what
i
found
was
lack
of
complexity
since
the
style
inherently
has
muted
hop
flavor
and
aroma
one
must
work
the
complexities
of
the
malt
yeast
and
cellaring
processes
in
order
to
compensate
that
is
exactly
where
this
beer
fell
short
i
felt
like
this
beer
was
simply
a
well
attenuated
crystalmalt
darkened
american
pale
ale
labeled
as
a
scotch
sure
it
was
drinkable
but
as
far
as
developing
the
nuances
of
a
completely
unique
style
i
was
left
hanging
drinkability
very
tastey
glad
i
got
my
hands
on
one
of
these
since
they
are
no
longer
found
in
new
england
i
could
purchase
these
often
this
drink
is
something
i
will
definitely
go
back
to
time
and
time
again
dthis
is
one
hell
of
a
beer
i
would
consider
this
a
cross
between
a
ipa
and
a
scottish
ale
poured
an
attractive
brown
color
with
hints
of
red
nice
slightly
offwhite
head
that
hung
around
for
a
while
aroma
is
of
caramel
chocolate
and
roasted
malts
flavor
is
of
the
same
and
taste
improves
as
it
warms
slightly
lacing
on
glass
was
decent
and
mouthfeel
was
very
nice
drinkability
was
good
for
a
beer
of
7
2
abv
good
stuff
overall
its
3
floyds
what
can
i
say
i
love
all
of
their
beers
they
take
common
styles
and
put
their
own
spin
on
them
not
a
big
fan
of
scottish
ales
but
when
3
floyds
got
done
with
it
this
one
is
a
winner
beer
poured
out
smooth
with
an
excellent
head
it
had
a
wonderful
deep
copper
color
one
of
the
darkest
scotchstyle
ales
ive
had
nice
scent
not
overwhelming
with
a
nice
malty
and
roasted
aroma
good
taste
nice
roasted
and
malty
taste
but
not
as
strong
as
other
scotch
ales
ive
had
great
going
down
though
this
is
probably
the
smoothest
scotch
ale
ive
ever
had
i
will
absolutely
be
picking
some
more
of
this
up
next
time
im
back
in
my
home
state
this
was
unlike
any
beer
i
have
had
previously
and
i
spent
a
lot
of
time
with
just
the
12oz
i
had
fun
and
interesting
to
taste
but
i
dont
know
how
many
more
i
could
drink
in
a
sitting
the
taste
is
bountiful
yet
the
mouthfeel
remains
light
on
the
palate
leading
to
a
smooth
easy
drinking
beer
pours
a
deep
garnet
red
hue
with
hazy
clarity
a
pale
biege
three
finger
head
forms
a
dense
and
creamy
cap
that
holds
well
and
leaves
spotty
lacing
extra
malty
nose
like
dark
caramel
and
deeply
toasted
grains
with
a
hint
of
roasted
barley
and
chocolate
malt
a
mellow
vinous
aroma
and
suggestion
of
dark
fruit
ester
form
as
the
temperature
rise
along
with
an
herbal
and
earthy
english
hop
note
the
first
sip
is
ripe
with
sweet
caramel
and
crystal
malt
flavor
and
a
robust
dextrinous
grainy
tone
a
flash
of
roasted
barley
and
soft
chocolate
malt
preceed
the
semidrying
aftertaste
that
puts
the
flavor
in
near
perfect
balance
lush
hop
leaf
flavors
like
minty
tobacco
leaf
and
earthwoody
resins
complete
the
hop
to
malt
ratio
and
a
subtle
but
ample
bitterness
rounds
out
the
formidable
malt
sweetness
the
body
is
medium
with
a
light
and
gentle
carbonation
that
allows
the
dextrins
lto
inger
and
adds
to
the
rich
and
viscous
mouthfeel
this
makes
for
a
satisfying
beer
but
also
one
that
puches
the
boundaries
of
scottich
ale
and
leans
more
toward
scotch
ale
thus
the
drinkability
suffers
some
but
the
finish
is
still
remakable
clean
considering
the
vast
array
and
depth
of
malt
character
the
residual
sweetness
that
does
remain
dries
fairly
quickly
and
the
mintwood
hop
flavor
hangs
on
with
it
a
grape
tannin
and
slight
plum
ester
devlop
more
fully
near
the
end
but
does
not
detract
too
heavily
from
the
drinkability
a
good
beer
for
people
that
like
thier
scottich
ale
in
the
8090
shilling
range
d
a
nice
flavorful
scottish
ale
the
last
of
my
two
3f
sixers
from
dark
lord
day
2007
ive
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
beer
a
good
scottish
ale
rich
caramel
in
color
buttery
toffee
on
the
nose
and
nice
dark
brown
sugar
taste
with
a
hint
of
roastedness
more
than
anything
though
this
beer
along
with
dark
lord
represents
a
day
a
very
memorable
day
where
i
met
a
ton
of
cool
folks
and
had
a
lot
of
awesome
beer
recommended
good
offering
from
a
wonderful
brewery
poured
a
nice
head
that
disappeared
a
minute
latter
leaving
a
small
ring
of
lace
around
the
glass
the
color
was
an
amber
brown
with
a
light
carbonation
the
smell
of
roasted
barley
and
nice
fruity
yeasty
bread
taste
of
fruit
bread
prune
raisins
toffe
and
ripe
fruit
a
great
beer
for
the
style
clear
dark
amberbrown
and
very
short
appearance
from
a
fizzy
beige
head
leaving
behind
scant
lace
sweet
malt
and
caramel
in
the
nose
with
some
faint
tropical
fruit
aromas
wafting
about
excellent
nutty
malts
roasted
grains
whole
grain
bread
brown
sugar
cream
soda
hints
of
coffee
in
the
middle
and
tart
notes
at
the
end
the
finish
is
of
burnt
sugars
dry
and
some
tea
herbals
frothy
mouthfeel
on
a
smooth
consistency
tingly
carbonation
on
the
tongue
is
lasting
nice
complexities
here
and
quite
enjoyable
poured
into
a
mug
a
nice
brown
that
shows
some
copper
highlights
when
held
to
light
the
beer
is
topped
with
a
decent
head
that
diminishes
to
a
ring
the
aroma
is
of
brown
malts
and
a
hint
of
caramel
a
little
weak
though
the
taste
is
a
wonderful
blend
of
malts
some
caramel
dried
fruits
and
a
hint
of
smoke
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
with
low
carbonation
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
for
the
style
poured
into
a
nonic
glass
pours
a
clear
dark
brown
with
a
decent
head
that
fell
leaving
a
little
lace
the
aroma
is
of
big
malt
with
slight
coffee
tones
i
taste
a
small
stout
and
alot
of
malt
with
a
slight
hop
note
a
very
smooth
beer
that
is
rich
and
creamy
medium
bodied
it
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
that
i
like
to
session
drinkability
although
kind
of
tasty
i
was
expecting
something
more
like
old
chub
but
i
got
old
chub
light
its
still
a
good
beer
and
very
drinkable
its
just
lacking
all
the
big
flavor
that
i
expected
d
very
drinkable
beer
stays
consistent
as
you
are
drinking
always
maintains
a
nice
flavor
and
is
not
too
heavy
yet
still
has
a
nice
body
to
it
mouthfeeldrinkability
its
light
to
medium
bodied
carbonation
is
good
goes
down
pretty
smooth
i
probably
wouldnt
session
it
but
its
reasonably
easy
to
drink
overall
its
a
good
scottish
ale
flavourwise
theres
a
bit
of
licorice
caramel
cocoa
plum
raisin
and
definite
alcohol
enjoyable
herbal
character
to
it
as
well
its
not
as
complex
as
a
lot
of
scotch
ales
ive
had
but
its
enjoyable
and
the
flavours
all
stand
on
their
own
not
muddy
or
awkward
mouthfeel
is
medium
carbonated
and
the
body
is
much
lighter
than
i
was
expecting
its
really
quaffable
and
at
7
you
can
have
a
couple
at
least
this
is
a
real
nice
scottish
ale
from
fff
and
one
ill
have
again
for
sure
recommended
a
nice
tasty
scottish
ale
not
overly
different
or
unique
but
definitely
tasty
d
a
quite
drinkable
beer
a
good
effort
from
3
floyds
not
something
i
would
seek
out
though
above
average
in
conclusion
im
glad
i
tried
it
as
i
am
a
fan
of
scottish
history
another
good
choice
from
3f
a
fair
scottish
ale
but
i
think
it
could
be
better
it
pours
a
deep
caramel
color
little
aroma
not
much
head
up
front
theres
a
solid
maltiness
and
something
that
reminds
me
vaguely
of
peat
though
im
pretty
sure
nothing
in
here
is
peatsmoked
theres
not
much
middle
at
all
it
kind
o
disappears
on
your
tongue
until
an
aftertaste
with
a
mild
but
pleasantly
sour
tang
and
a
hint
of
alcohol
comes
in
a
good
beer
for
drinking
with
food
i
think
but
nothing
to
get
excited
about
update
have
had
this
many
times
since
i
wish
they
made
less
of
this
and
more
of
some
of
their
other
stuff
how
many
times
have
i
seen
this
and
pj
as
the
last
3fs
stuff
on
the
shelves
sometimes
i
think
people
only
get
this
stuff
although
i
know
a
few
who
are
fans
of
it
bc
they
didnt
have
the
chance
to
buy
gumball
or
zombie
d
a
nice
treat
sorta
sweet
pretty
hoppy
and
a
good
representation
of
the
style
d
great
taste
and
unique
enough
that
i
would
enjoy
this
one
again
and
again
even
a
gentle
pour
yielded
an
enormous
pillowy
head
the
remained
in
place
for
ages
atop
the
slightly
hazy
orange
bronze
body
the
smell
was
quite
powerful
and
made
its
way
to
my
nose
in
less
than
5
seconds
after
removing
the
cap
this
brew
is
all
malt
for
certain
sweet
notes
of
toasted
cereals
and
grains
dominate
without
question
with
perhaps
a
modest
touch
of
caramel
there
is
even
some
fairly
easily
identifiable
candied
fruit
nuances
in
this
one
as
well
taste
begins
with
a
sweet
malty
flavour
that
almost
seems
to
border
on
being
chocolatey
but
not
quite
the
middle
is
very
slightly
bitter
for
only
a
fraction
of
a
second
and
then
the
sweet
grains
return
for
a
smooth
pleasantly
sweet
finish
this
is
a
good
representation
of
the
style
and
a
great
beer
too
bad
this
isnt
available
in
ga
regretably
i
had
only
this
one
note
if
youre
expecting
a
true
to
the
form
scotch
ale
this
isnt
your
beer
at
first
it
struck
me
as
the
lovechild
between
a
brown
ale
and
a
scotch
ale
dont
get
me
wrong
its
very
good
and
i
will
gladly
consume
more
in
the
future
a
decent
beer
it
doesnt
really
stand
out
too
much
but
its
pretty
drinkable
and
its
got
some
interesting
flavors
just
nothing
that
really
stands
out
overall
im
not
sure
id
get
it
again
now
that
ive
tried
it
but
it
was
definitely
worth
a
go
d
good
i
would
pick
this
up
again
for
sure
this
is
a
good
beer
but
its
not
really
up
to
snuff
for
3f
as
it
really
doest
compare
to
some
of
their
other
brews
another
fine
brew
from
the
3
fs
i
drink
drink
a
bunchabout
three
of
these
before
the
flavor
gets
a
little
annoying
but
in
a
bar
next
to
a
heineken
i
could
drink
this
one
all
night
a
decently
malted
brew
my
next
trip
to
indiana
will
certainly
include
a
trip
to
three
floyds
with
ol
bobby
in
mind
bottle
into
tulip
glass
a
light
colored

moderate

dark

only
slightly
detectable
t
firm
maltmaple
syrup
backbone
up
front
followed
close
by
plums
blackberries
lots
of
sweetness
the
hops
register
on
the
finish
but
only
slightly
really
great
balance
for
such
a
sweet
beer
m
moderate
carbonation
a
tad
thin
for
a
high
abv
the
alcohol
is
nearly
imperceptible
d
all
around
very
nice
though
the
label
made
it
seem
much
more
malty
than
it
actually
was
very
drinkable
id
definitely
buy
it
again
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
brew
i
really
enjoyed
it
could
be
very
refreshing
on
a
hot
summers
day
i
really
enjoyed
it
not
sessionable
though
overall
its
a
very
very
drinkable
beer
one
id
definitely
get
again
particularly
because
its
the
best
available
scotch
ale
around
probably
but
i
was
really
hoping
for
this
beer
to
be
the
top
of
the
crop
for
my
scotchy
addiction
this
was
a
throw
in
bottle
was
courtesy
of
cresant
thanks
again
d
it
is
a
heavier
beer
not
great
on
a
hot
day
that
said
great
with
a
heavy
meal
or
when
its
a
bit
cooler
out
pours
light
brown
into
pint
glass
very
littleno
head
with
aggressive
pour
very
minimal

roasted

with
a

taste
is
very
nice
toasted
malts
with
cocoa
coffee
and
dark
fruit
bit
of
floral
hops
at
the
end
makes
for
a
dry
finish
slightly
too
roasted
for
my
taste
but
still
very
drinkable
d
one
of
the
tastier
examples
of
the
style
sweet
malts
are
the
star
of
this
brew
and
they
show
well
drinkability
suffers
because
of
the
sweetness
nice
beer
took
the
bottle
out
of
the
fridge
about
90
minutes
before
pouring
it
into
my
glass
color
was
a
very
slightly
cloudy
deep
amberbrown
very
little
head
even
with
an
aggressive
pour
a
little
smell
of
carmel
but
barely
detectable
nice
smooth
taste
very
little
carbonation
mediumfull
body
no
flavors
really
jumped
out
at
me
a
little
hop
taste
on
the
finish
almost
seemed
a
little
buttery
on
the
middle
of
the
tongue
being
a
resident
of
the
three
floyds
hometown
i
feel
obligated
to
try
their
beers
and
am
rarely
disappointed
robert
the
bruce
is
another
example
of
fine
brewing
with
a
nice
hoppy
flavor
and
good
head
while
far
from
my
favorite
this
robert
the
bruce
is
a
solid
beer
and
ranks
high
as
a
scottish
ale
in
my
view
certainly
better
than
the
mcewens
i
usually
have
pours
a
nice
head
that
falls
immediatly
but
doesnt
break
it
has
a
very
nice
lacing
and
very
dark
brown
color
to
it
the
smell
is
hoppy
with
some
caramel
and
a
slight
sourness
the
taste
is
very
caramallike
theres
some
nice
hops
that
go
with
it
almost
none
of
the
sourness
comes
out
like
in
the
smell
the
mouthfeel
was
nice
didnt
have
any
bite
or
wateryness
its
a
medium
bodied
beer
overall
this
is
the
best
robert
the
bruce
i
have
ever
had
i
may
just
drink
the
last
one
in
the
fridge
tonight
this
is
a
tasty
scottish
ale
very
enjoyable
beer
poured
a
nice
deep
red
color
very
clear
with
a
nice
head
that
quickly
dissipates
love
the
aroma
with
hints
of
caramel
and
toasted
malts
very
nice
mouthfeel
with
a
medium
body
slightly
warming
on
the
way
down
very
sweet
malt
flavor
with
just
the
right
balance
of
hops
behind
it
caramel
flavor
really
comes
through
on
this
beer
with
just
a
hint
of
smokiness
lingering
in
the
background
overall
this
is
a
wonderful
drinking
beer
very
well
balanced
a
good
friend
of
mine
brought
us
a
load
of
three
floyds
a
sixpack
of
robert
the
bruce
included
drank
a
12
oz
bottle
of
this
from
the
2006
batch
im
guessing
served
in
a
pint
glass
pours
a
clear
dark
ruby
color
with
little
to
no
head
smells
very
strongly
of
toasted
malt
and
caramel
really
love
the
caramel
aromas
some
hints
of
nuttiness
in
there
too
which
makes
it
smell
closer
to
a
brown
ale
than
a
scottish
taste
has
a
nice
clean
center
of
toasted
malt
almost
no
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
lightbodied
overall
a
nice
easy
beer
good
example
of
a
scottish
ale
lovely
deep
mahogany
and
a
lot
of
effervescence
going
on
thin
rim
of
retention
awesome
nose
fruity
woody
and
just
plain
inviting
the
taste
doesnt
stray
from
the
enticing
aromas
this
has
the
right
amount
of
malt
and
yet
doesnt
feel
flat
and
lifeless
on
the
tongue
very
balanced
and
highly
drinkable
this
beer
is
superb
md
the
malts
give
this
beer
a
great
smooth
mouthfeel
with
a
nice
mouthcoat
and
easy
down
especially
for
a
higerish
abv
a
splendid
beer
from
an
amazing
brewery
incredible
huge
head
that
has
great
retention
i
poured
into
a
pint
glass
smell
was
chocolatey
taste
was
fairly
good
nice
malty
flavor
very
chocolatey
not
a
lot
of
complexity
though
nice
mouthfeel
good
but
not
great
easy
to
drink
a
decent
session
beer
definetly
worth
a
try
i
have
one
more
and
will
drink
it
soon
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
would
expect
better
from
three
floyds
poured
a
dark
red
amber
color
with
an
off
white
head
that
quickly
disappeared
nothing
particular
jumped
out
at
me
in
the
smell
and
it
is
a
medium
bodied
scottish
ale
very
good
flavor
although
not
very
hoppy
and
a
few
could
go
down
quickly
in
one
sitting
wish
there
was
a
little
more
carbonation
that
would
add
to
the
mouthfeel
which
is
otherwise
a
little
flat
note
as
i
finish
my
first
bottle
and
open
the
second
my
belly
warms
considerabley
from
the
alcohol
which
by
the
way
did
not
show
itself
in
the
nose
nor
in
the
mouth
12oz
bottle
poured
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
small
tan
head
that
leaves
some
spots
of
lace
smell
has
a
light
aroma
of
roasted
malt
taste
is
mostly
roasted
malt
with
a
slight
presence
of
floral
hops
in
the
finish
this
brew
seems
to
have
more
body
than
i
would
expect
due
to
it
not
having
bold
flavors
but
is
still
easily
drinkable
and
would
make
a
good
session
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
dark
amber
with
a
thin
white
head
that
doesnt
last
very
long
and
doesnt
leave
much
in
the
way
of
lacing
either
aroma
is
slightly
smokey
with
some
toffee
and
caramel
in
there
as
well
taste
is
similar
with
a
little
fruitiness
in
there
as
well
with
a
slightly
bitter
finish
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
in
my
opinion
despite
the
7
this
is
pretty
drinkable
showing
no
signs
of
alcohol
pours
a
nice
brown
color
thats
hard
to
see
through
not
quite
clear
with
a
slight
orange
hue
dont
blink
your
eye
or
youll
miss
the
off
white
head
a
sweet
familiar
malty
aroma
and
a
little
smoke
with
a
hint
of
alcohol
the
flavor
is
a
smooth
sweet
malt
and
a
little
chocolate
with
a
nice
surprise
at
the
end
dryer
than
the
first
sense
medium
bodied
and
easy
to
drink
i
didnt
realize
it
was
7
its
not
normal
thanks
to
jhammerly
for
the
opportunity
to
try
it
taste
is
sweet
and
caramellic
with
some
syrupy
notes
there
is
a
weird
kind
of
perfumy
taste
to
it
reminds
me
of
heather
could
that
be
in
there
for
me
this
beer
is
not
what
i
have
in
mind
with
a
scottish
ale
which
are
usually
sweeter
and
more
pronounced
by
the
yeast
flavors
body
was
medium
and
aftertaste
was
sweet
and
short
drinkability
another
flavorful
quality
brew
from
three
floyds
hmm
this
one
could
make
for
a
surprisingly
good
session
beer
surprisingly
small
for
such
a
big
beer
almost
has
more
of
an
english
mild
meets
scotch
ale
sort
of
taste
very
nice
though
overall
and
i
beer
i
wouldnt
mind
having
again
poured
out
a
dark
opaque
brown
close
to
cola
corwned
with
a
super
fine
off
white
head
the
nose
is
malty
with
alcohol
figs
raisin
and
some
mild
spicyness
the
taste
is
huge
a
whallop
of
malt
rounded
out
by
coffee
a
bit
of
cocoa
and
some
dark
dried
fruit
mouthfeel
has
mild
carbonation
slightly
creamy
finishes
a
bit
cloying
and
heavy
balanced
towards
the
sweetmaltalcohol
side
drinkable
yes
but
its
flatness
hurts
the
score
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
im
surprised
its
not
bolder
given
the
other
offerings
from
this
brewery
i
found
this
beer
to
be
pretty
mildmannered
for
a
three
floyds
product
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
that
i
got
while
visiting
the
folks
in
indiana
poured
a
nice
brownish
mahagony
with
a
small
head
that
quickly
dissipated
the
aroma
was
of
roasted
malts
with
good
sweetness
in
there
as
well
the
mouthfeel
was
good
the
taste
was
perfect
it
was
smooth
and
had
a
great
smokiness
to
it
could
see
myself
drinking
plenty
of
these
4
5
hr
t
y
overall
pretty
much
dead
on
for
style
very
drinkable
two
thumbs
up
and
pour
me
another
dark
amber
with
some
light
brown
highlights
a
thin
head
with
tiny
bubbles
sweet
malts
light
hops
and
traces
of
alcohol
on
the
nosesimple
but
nice
up
front
a
twangy
hop
bitterness
to
be
expected
from
3f
caramel
malts
a
very
slick
and
smooth
texture
and
body
piney
hops
residue
lingers
for
a
while
there
are
some
noticeable
dark
fruits
and
raisins
that
come
into
play
the
finish
maintains
the
mentioned
hoppybitterness
and
slick
body
just
a
trace
of
alcohol
detected
a
mighty
fine
scottish
ale
d
it
is
pretty
good
kind
of
subtle
on
taste
and
aroma
it
is
a
easy
drinking
beer
isnt
anything
big
and
offensive
though
with
a
name
like
robert
the
bruce
you
cant
help
saying
it
with
a
silly
scoish
accent
if
its
not
scottish
its
crrrrap
d
it
was
a
pleasure
to
drink
this
offering
from
three
floyds
smooth
and
soft
with
big
flavors
another
good
one
from
these
guys
big
thanks
to
josh
for
this
medium
body
low
carbonation
the
balance
on
this
one
is
excellent
even
with
the
big
malt
aroma
flavor
the
hops
come
in
nicely
in
the
finish
to
keep
it
in
check
alcohol
content
is
well
hidden
im
still
not
sure
i
believe
its
7
very
clean
with
excellent
drinkability
taste
very
mild
and
not
nearly
as
sweet
as
i
was
expecting
the
sweet
malt
was
more
evident
in
the
aftertaste
that
anywhere
else
the
flavors
upfront
were
more
fruity
with
cherry
and
a
little
raisin
the
finish
had
a
surprising
amount
of
hops
bitterness
for
the
style
which
dried
out
the
beer
and
countered
the
lateemerging
malts
there
was
a
little
warm
alcohol
on
the
finish
too
overall
a
good
scottish
ale
and
recommended
the
beer
pours
brown
with
some
maroon
tints
to
it
with
an
offwhite
head
it
smells
mainly
like
piney
hops
along
with
some
peppery
spicyness
however
it
tastes
a
bit
different
than
it
smells
it
tastes
like
caramel
sweet
malt
floral
hops
and
some
pepperclove
spicyness
it
starts
off
sweet
and
then
has
a
hoppy
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
light
medium
with
some
slight
creaminess
the
drinkability
is
good
too
as
its
smooth
and
has
relatively
low
carbonation
this
is
a
pretty
decent
beer
another
good
offering
from
three
floyds
pours
a
two
finger
light
tan
head
that
fades
slowly
to
a
shallow
layer
leaving
some
lace
deep
amber
color
light
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
faint
caramel
nose
starts
balanced
with
some
caramel
sweetness
smooth
finish
some
hops
showing
up

a
nice

ia
d
pretty
good
beer
with
good
flavor
and
nice
balance
i
really
liked
the
spices
and
would
recommend
this
beer
despite
some
flaws
its
good
enough
to
get
again
pours
a
dark
brown

nice
carbonation
fizzy
tan
head
some
lacing
around
the
edges
scents
of

slight
hops

and
a
nice
touch

caramel
nice
clean

medium

well
rounded
brew
drinkable
a
nice
little
brew
from
3fs
i
dig
this
one
excellent
sipping
beer
alcohol
is
well
regulated
im
really
glad
ive
got
an
extra
bottle
will
try
this
again
down
the
road
from
now
every
now
and
then
i
buy
a
sixpack
of
this
and
after
about
four
bottles
over
the
course
of
a
few
weeks
i
get
kind
of
bored
with
it
i
dont
know
why
imo
this
beer
is
the
weak
link
in
the
3f
portfolio
at
best
i
find
this
a
situational
beer
robert
the
bruce
is
available
in
sixpacks
in
council
bluffs
ia
worth
a
try
slainte
that
said
this
beer
does
pour
up
a
deep
amber
hue
clear
and
very
nice
to
look
at
very
little
immediate
head
but
a
nice
cap
sticks
with
the
brew
the
smell
is
piney
effervescent
and
almost
all
rich
hop
with
some
citrus
shining
through
as
well
but
in
the
back
you
can
still
pick
up
the
trademark
toasted
malt
that
comes
with
the
scotch
the
taste
mirrors
the
aroma
hoppy
up
front
but
that
quickly
gives
way
to
the
toasty
coffee
flavor
which
is
abruptly
followed
by
a
cascade
of
herbal
hop
noise
again
pretty
complex
and
not
bad
to
drink
the
mouthfeel
is
very
good
smooth
and
creamy
possibly
a
bit
under
carbonated
overall
this
is
a
quaffer
through
and
through
go
try
some
d
easy
to
drink
doesnt
tire
out
your
mouth
at
all
not
bad
ive
heard
a
lot
of
good
things
about
this
beer
and
i
was
slightly
disappointed
it
was
good
but
not
great
the
combination
of
flavors
started
out
well
but
ended
up
being
conflicting
and
distracting
im
not
an
expert
in
this
style
but
overall
this
did
not
match
my
palette
i
would
definitely
give
this
another
try
though
and
damn
thats
some
fine
artwork
wish
i
could
taste
more
booze
in
it
thats
just
me
my
first
scottish
ale
seems
like
an
exact
cross
between
an
old
ale
and
a
porter
at
least
in
this
beer
very
nice
flavors
an
excellent
malt
presence
and
heavenly
carbonation
structure
recommended
for
sure
opinion
i
am
really
enjoying
this
beer
it
has
a
defined
malty
edge
that
stays
in
control
the
entire
time
while
there
is
enough
hops
roast
and
alcohol
to
keep
the
beer
balanced
and
very
drinkable
the
caramel
is
pleasant
and
gets
more
so
as
the
beer
warms
up
some
the
thing
i
like
the
most
is
that
there
isnt
one
particular
flavor
other
than
the
caramel
that
is
truly
defined
this
beer
is
very
well
crafted
and
i
would
certainly
drink
it
again
poured
a
dark
brownish
red
color
with
a
tannish
head
leaving
no
lacing
caramel
toffee
and
roasted
barley
plenty
of
hops
present
as
well
sweet
caramel
and
toffee
paired
with
roastiness
a
lingering
cocoa
finish
high
carbonation
medium
to
full
bodied
pretty
decent
beer
to
have
once
in
a
while
worthy
of
a
try
drinkability
easy
to
drink
but
be
careful
that
alcohol
can
creep
up
on
you
drinkability
yes
i
wouldwill
drink
again
this
is
a
good
example
of
the
style
this
beer
is
every
bit
as
good
as
it
was
the
first
time
i
tried
it
absolutely
wonderful
dark
ruby
redauburn
color
with
a
decentsized
rocky
tan
head
slightly
roasty
sweet
malt
smell
rich
toffeemalt
sweet
taste
with
a
slightly
bitter
earthy
hop
finish
and
aftertaste
medium
body
smooth
with
light
carbonation
nice
malty
ale
that
goes
pretty
well
with
food
and
goes
down

0
abv
it
poured
a
rich
brown
with
little
to
no
head
meaning
it
foamed
a
bit
at
its
initial
pour
but
rested
comfotably
at
a
lace
it
smelt
of
a
typical
scottish
ale
with
emphasis
on
molasses
on
the
tongue
it
was
fullbodied
with
little
grittiness
no
discernable
fruit
flavors
or
herbs
that
i
could
place
quite
the
lager
of
scottish
ales
very
average
but
a
welldone
average
scottish
ale
pours
a
dark
brown
almost
black
like
black
licorice
held
in
front
of
the
light
there
are
red
high
lights
medium
head
that
slowly
dissipates
the
contrast
between
the
body
and
the
head
is
lovely
the
sent
is
not
as
strong
as
most
three
floyds
ive
smelled
but
this
is
still
very
pleasant
mild
alcohol
anise
carmel
little
to
no
fruit
notes
the
bitter
hops
is
much
tamer
then
most
three
floyds
but
still
there
the
taste
is
great
i
havent
had
too
many
scottish
ales
but
i
really
enjoy
this
one
the
mild
sweetness
of
the
finish
coupled
with
the
bitterness
is
excellent
this
is
definitely
a
beer
i
could
drink
this
ale
poured
slightly
hazy
dark
chestnut
color
with
tan
foam
that
settled
flat
the
smell
was
sweet
and
malty
with
notes
of
caramel
and
a
touch
of
hops
the
taste
was
sweet
and
very
malty
with
caramel
malt
prominent
and
a
hint
of
cocoa
there
was
mild
to
moderate
hoppiness
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
with
medium
body
and
low
carbonation
feel
caramel
and
malt
flavors
lingered
in
the
aftertaste
this
was
a
nice
scottish
ale
this
beer
is
a
about
the
color
of
cloudy
sweet
tea
there
was
a
very
small
head
the
smell
is
caramel
like
the
taste
is
somewhat
bitter
it
is
like
a
blend
of
a
red
and
a
brown
there
is
an
aftertaste
that
stays
a
while
the
beer
is
fairly
smooth
and
there
is
a
slight
hop
bitterness
but
this
beer
is
more
about
the
malt
the
drinkability
is
fine
i
may
try
this
one
again
but
no
big
deal
if
i
dont
only
slightly
above
average
to
me
all
in
all
another
great
beer
by
three
floyds
i
could
stand
it
even
stronger
tasting
ive
been
on
a
kick
for
that
lately
but
that
said
this
oddly
named
brew
three
different
mens
names
satisfied
my
insatiable
beer
appetite
body
is
amber
and
bordering
on
brown
head
is
a
half
finger
of
white
foam
damn
what
a
malty
nose
lots
of
caramel
and
grapefruit
as
for
taste
its
a
world
of
caramel
syrupy
cherry
a
slice
of
wheatbread
and
lots
of
hoppiness
it
tastes
marvelous
but
to
be
honest
i
would
have
rated
this
higher
had
the
hops
not
been
so
dominant
it
seems
i
get
far
more
hops
than
i
should
for
the
style
i
love
hops
but
i
wish
this
were
a
beefy
version
of
the
style
instead
of
a
hops
infused
one
carbonation
is
active
but
not
in
your
face
mouth
feels
very
big
i
know
i
complained
about
the
assertive
hops
but
this
does
taste
really
good
i
wouldnt
reach
for
this
first
when
looking
for
a
scottish
ale
but
i
would
reach
for
this
when
looking
for
something
malty
and
tasty
drinkability
strong
but
also
funky
snuh
i
was
initially
planning
to
buy
a
sixer
but
opted
to
get
a
few
other
singles
instead
i
will
definitely
pick
this
up
in
the
future
drinkability
i
surly
didnt
have
a
problem
drinking
this
one
down
i
could
probably
drink
this
one
again
if
no
other
3
floyds
was
available
i
think
if
robert
the
bruce
was
alive
he
might
have
been
proud
that
his
name
was
on
this
3
floyds
beer
pours
a
hazy
redbrown
small
off
white
head
forms
settles
to
a
ring
quick
nice
lace
though
smell
is
sweet
and
malty
toffee
chocolate
and
then
citruspine
hop
finish
i
love
3f
taste
is
very
malty
toffee
and
chocolate
again
grainy
and
rich
pine
hops
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
low
carbonation
very
smooth
clean
bitterness
drinkability
very
easy
i
usually
have
problems
having
more
than
one
beer
in
a
sitting
this
could
have
a
little
more
body
though
d
over
all
a
fantastic
beer
this
is
a
good
example
of
how
to
capture
a
malty
flavor
without
it
beening
undrinkably
sweet
drinkability
this
beer
seems
typical
of
a
lot
of
three
floyds
offerings
very
hoppy
especially
considering
the
style
not
as
malty
and
creamy
as
i
like
my
scottish
ales
drinkability
is
slightly
above
average
for
this
beer
i
probably
wouldnt
consume
more
than
2
or
3
in
a
sitting
before
switching
to
something
a
bit
lighter
extremely
smooth
with
upfront
malt
sweetness
and
a
touch
of
smoke
midsip
a
wave
of
alcohol
takes
over
but
is
quickly
replaced
by
a
caramel
sweetness
viscousy
mouthfeel
that
envelops
the
tongue
spot
on
for
style
though
alcohol
is
a
tad
high
definitely
worth
seeking
out
though
at
this
price
not
an
everyday
brew
drinkability
this
is
quite
drinkable
and
a
welcome
change
of
pace
from
a
brewery
known
for
its
love
of
hops
i
was
hoping
for
a
little
more
body
as
it
is
it
is
a
light
medium
body
alcohol
becomes
warming
but
by
no
means
does
it
detract
from
the
overall
feel
and
flavor
of
the
beer
a
little
watery
slick
stickiness
to
the
tongue
and
teeth
a
good
scottish
ale
that
i
would
recommend
to
anyone
thinmedium
body
with
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
7
isnt
knock
you
on
your
ass
crazy
but
it
never
shows
through
and
this
could
be
a
very
good
session
beer
drinkability
good
a
fff
take
on
lower
shilling
scottish
ales
which
compares
favorably
to
other
90
shilling
ales
like
odells
or
sam
adams
while
this
has
a
hops
flourish
not
found
in
other
examples
it
achieves
nice
balance
and
a
super
finish
pours
dark
chocolate
brown
with
a
cream
colored
head
that
fades
quick
stongest
aroma
is
a
sweet
evergreen
piney
hoppiness
behind
that
there
is
some
malty
sweet
aromas
of
ripe
strawberries
raspberries
honey
and
a
little
fig
taste
follows
the
smell
pretty
closely
with
piney
hops
followed
by
sweet
berries
and
finishing
peppery
a
little
smoky
roasted
character
as
well
i
was
hoping
for
a
little
more
from
the
malts
and
less
from
the
hops
but
a
decent
beer
overall
this
is
not
my
favorite
scottish
ale
by
any
means
but
its
a
good
interpretation
of
the
style
and
one
id
recommend
to
anyone
pours
a
deep
mahogany
color
with
some
ruby
edges
thick
offwhite
head
hold
rather
well
and
when
it
does
disappear
it
leaves
some
nice
patches
of
lace
aroma
is
of
candied
fruit
caramel
and
a
hint
of
ripe
fruit
flavors
are
strong
cararmel
toffee
slightly
toasty
malt
a
hint
of
smoke
and
candy
fruit
the
fruity
flavors
are
subtle
but
do
not
seem
to
be
citrusy
low
carbonation
and
a
medium
body
overall
a
good
brew
maybe
not
what
you
expect
from
a
stronger
scottish
ale
but
still
soild
and
drinkable
did
not
like
the
way
it
finished
another
beer
i
wouldnt
turn
down
but
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
purchase
very
nice
session
beer
the
7
is
invisible
you
could
have
told
me
this
was
a
5
beer
big
thanks
to
hero27
for
the
bottle
this
was
a
delightful
departure
from
many
of
the
west
coast
hopsupyouass
beers
that
i
often
drink
and
love
of
course
that
illustrated
the
other
side
of
beer
malt
drinkability
very
nice
session
beer
im
a
confirmed
hophead
but
i
just
love
this
one
three
floyds
simply
doesnt
brew
a
bad
beer
and
this
one
is
great
smooth
drinking
mouthfeel
pretty
creamy
and
smooth
with
a
lager
like
feel
pretty
easy
to
pund
down
if
it
wasnt
7
abv
a
malty
sweet
palate
mostly
with
very
little
hop
bitterness
its
almost
like
the
malts
play
double
duty
wth
the
sweet
and
notsosweet
d
very
very
tasty
brew
if
you
like
malty
beers
as
i
do
not
all
that
similar
to
other
scotchscottish
ales
but
very
tasty
despite
the
fullness
in
the
body
and
sweetness
highly
drinkable
and
not
all
that
filling
once
again
thank
you
mabz
for
helping
my
get
such
a
great
beer
medium
mouthfeel
my
tongue
felt
a
bit
scorched
its
a
reasonably
good
scottish
but
not
my
fave
taste
reflects
the
aroma
well
dominated
by
a
caramel
honey
sweetness
with
a
nice
smoky
character
prickly
carbonation
and
a
mediumheavy
mouthfeel
finish
has
the
barest
touch
of
alcohol
complex
and
enjoyable
and
gone
before
you
know
it
d
pretty
drinkable
i
could
have
a
couple
of
these
no
problem
tastes
smooth
chocolatey
malty
smokey
mmmm
alcoholey
very
drinkable
nutty
and
balanced
it
only
gets
better
when
it
gets
warmer
leaves
my
stomach
with
a
warm
happy
feeling
overall
it
is
a
drinkable
and
enjoyable
beer
its
a
somewhat
different
interpretation
but
seems
to
work
deep
chocolate
amber
brew
with
a
rich
malt
aroma
settles
on
our
tongue
like
a
cool
fog
on
a
small
town
yummy
beer
that
makes
you
want
more
but
doesnt
make
you
think
have
incredibly
subtle
flavors
but
doesnt
hit
you
in
the
face
with
hops
or
malts
nice
hearty
beer
that
you
can
have
more
than
one
pours
copper
hue
with
significant
carbonation
but
only
a
thin
buttermilk
head
not
much
going
on
aromawise
although
if
the
minimalist
head
retention
was
specific
to
my
bottle
or
pour
that
may
have
had
something
to
do
with
it
a
fizzy
fairly
viscous
sweet
brown
sugar
greets
the
tongue
with
a
faint
bit
of
hop
bitterness
at
the
finish
tastes
an
awful
lot
like
a
brown
ale
to
me
maybe
a
little
bit
sweeter
sweetnessbitterness
pretty
well
balanced
though
nothing
spectacular
overall
a
fairly
vanilla
offering
from
the
venerable
fff
brewery
its
a
shame
that
this
is
one
of
the
easier
to
find
beers
from
that
label
and
so
far
its
been
the
only
one
to
really
let
me
down
this
poured
reddish
brown
with
a
light
tan
head
good
sweet
malt
nose
and
a
bit
nutty
the
taste
was
sweet
malty
i
was
expecting
a
bit
more
peatyearthy
there
was
a
good
roasted
malt
component
as
it
warmed
up
i
couldnt
pick
out
any
hops
it
has
a
medium
body
and
is
very
drinkable
with
a
dry
finish
clear
chestnut
with
a
short
light
tan
head
decent
retention
and
some
lacing
composed
of
fine
bubbles
hops
hit
you
as
the
bottles
opened
but
the
intensity
diminishes
quickly
after
the
pour
malty
nose
with
lots
of
caramel
a
bit
of
chocolate
roast
and
toffee
delicate
hints
of
fruit
hops
and
vanilla
as
well
mild
sweetness
with
a
fairly
strong
bitterness
and
hop
flavour
some
caramel
and
maybe
a
bit
of
citrus
in
the
finish
mild
warming
in
the
finish
medium
body
and
carbonation
the
bubbles
were
a
little
rough
initially
but
settled
into
a
creamier
texture
after
some
time
overall
an
interesting
beer
with
a
few
rough
edges
i
was
a
little
let
down
with
the
simple
flavour
after
experiencing
a
thoroughly
enjoyable
aroma
the
beer
pours
a
clear
dark
amber
with
an
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
of
malt
with
heavy
tones
of
dark
fruit
then
a
bit
of
floral
hops
in
the
background
the
taste
has
the
good
malty
flavor
youd
expect
from
a
scottish
ale
but
its
also
backed
up
with
a
healthy
dose
of
dark
fruits
and
has
a
nice
floral
hop
finish
the
feel
is
medium
smooth
and
oily
this
beer
was
a
wonderful
find
i
was
looking
for
a
good
scotish
ale
and
this
was
the
only
offering
i
was
not
disappointed
and
will
be
purchasing
more
when
available
d
eh
i
was
really
expecting
a
lot
here
a
scottish
ale
from
three
floyds
it
should
have
been
great
instead
they
pulled
on
the
reigns
instead
of
letting
the
beer
run
wild
nice
taste
but
not
very
complex
this
is
a
great
brew
i
really
enjoy
the
woody
earthy
character
recommended
d
certainly
a
nice
break
from
a
hop
bomb
i
think
its
the
first
of
its
style
that
ive
had
and
i
would
like
to
have
it
around
i
am
starting
to
really
like
three
floyds
i
could
drink
a
load
of
these
beers
its
not
too
high
in
alcyhol
and
has
a
great
hop
component
that
keeps
you
thirsty
not
a
bad
little
scoth
ale
at
all
nice
scotch
ale
here
i
am
not
crazy
about
the
style
but
i
am
crazy
about
3
floyds
and
they
have
a
great
brew
here
very
malty
with
nice
caramel
chocolate
notes
not
many
hops
as
true
to
the
style
little
head
retention
and
pretty
nice
microsmell
highly
drinkable
and
a
nice
session
brew
d
extremely
high
i
would
drink
gallons
of
this
stuff
if
it
were
available
in
mass
full
of
flavor
but
not
too
viscous
also
beer
is
very
refreshing
after
a
hard
day
at
the
office
pours
a
deep
clear
chestnut
with
an
offwhite
head
aroma
of
sweet
malts
and
dark
bread
taste
is
toffee
and
treacle
and
whole
grains
this
is
a
rich
malty
drinkable
brew
some
notes
of
smoke
and
molasses
round
out
tihs
rare
treat
the
mouthfeel
is
also
good
but
not
great
becoming
a
tad
too
thin
when
the
carbonation
wears
out
this
is
very
drinkable
cerevisia
supra
omnia
d
this
is
a
great
session
beer
bottom
line
i
cant
remember
the
last
time
i
had
a
beer
of
this
style
made
in
the
us
but
this
ones
a
goody
give
it
a
try
moderate
body
is
not
too
heavy
to
lend
itself
away
from
being
easy
to
drink
spectacular
stuff
give
it
a
shot
thought
the
simplicity
of
the
flavor
make
up
is
compensated
with
malty
richness
breadiness
and
caramelization
it
still
lacks
the
refinement
of
the
true
scottish
ales
of
tranquair
or
belhaven
alpha
king
is
still
my
favorite
three
floyds
brew
but
this
one
aint
bad
the
warmer
the
hoppier
it
gets
very
enjoyable
perhaps
the
least
hoppy
beer
ive
had
from
this
brewery
fairly
balanced
though
and
another
satisying
beer
from
three
floyds
drinkability
very
drinkable
vigorous
pour
resuting
in
12
inch
head
that
rapidly
subsided
and
almost
no
lacing
nice
deep
redddish
brown
color
aroma
was
malty
not
overpowering
and
not
too
sweet
and
ironically
did
not
have
the
slight
acridness
of
roasted
malt
even
though
bottle
says
it
is
roasted
malt
very
faint
hop
aroma
almost
not
there
upon
tasting
there
was
no
hop
bitterness
which
is
as
per
the
style
but
rather
a
very
mild
very
pleasant
malt
taste
that
was
not
overly
sweet
and
then
finished
with
faint
taste
of
roasted
malt
without
acridness
that
sometimes
is
result
of
roasting
very
smooth
and
full
mouthfeel
i
rather
enjoyed
this
even
though
i
am
a
hophead
and
had
another
and
will
have
after
that
that
is
this
very
drinkable
and
something
i
would
get
when
taking
a
break
from
hops
another
great
offering
from
tf
you
by
surprise
if
not
careful
remeber
its
not
normal
pours
a
clear
but
dark
brown
color
with
a
reasonable
offwhite
head
smell
is
pretty
malty
with
the
blend
of
hops
that
i
have
come
to
associate
with
three
floyds
the
malt
flavor
is
fairly
complex
with
roasted
and
smokey
flavors
sweet
caramel
and
toffee
and
finishes
with
a
slight
tang
of
herbal
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
more
or
less
medium
with
slightly
low
carbonation
overall
fairly
well
balanced
and
easy
to
drink
drinkability
seems
pretty
good
i
would
love
to
sample
this
on
tap
quite
a
tasty
beer
here
but
it
isnt
quite
perfect
pleasant
scottish
ale
but
i
would
have
liked
a
bit
more
intense
of
a
flavor
i
could
see
buying
this
if
it
was
10
or
so
a
six
pack
a
slightly
hopped
up
version
of
the
style
and
i
say
that
hopped
up
lightly
the
hops
are
more
than
just
a
whimsy
of
the
senses
in
this
beer
but
this
beer
is
first
and
foremost
about
the
maltssweet
earthy
raosted
caramelized
and
peaty
nice
balanced
with
the
hops
however
i
have
a
hunch
that
if
the
hops
were
milderlesser
the
malts
would
seem
kind
of
thin
the
hops
support
the
malts
and
really
bring
them
out
medium
body
with
a
slight
bit
of
heat
from
the
alcohol
that
comes
across
as
a
spiciness
tough
to
put
this
one
down
easy
drinking
ale
here
another
goodie
dark
mahogany
brown
with
a
very
fine
tall
tan
head
aroma
is
surprising
for
the
style
big
shots
of
dried
flowers
from
the
hops
are
front
and
center
underneath
that
is
a
hint
of
roast
malt
caramel
and
dried
berries
it
comes
across
more
fresh
and
airy
than
earthy
it
is
still
nice
once
you
get
used
to
it
palate
is
full
with
again
quite
a
bit
of
hoppy
bitterness
for
the
style
caramel
is
dominant
but
the
roast
malt
and
flowers
linger
on
the
finish
for
a
big
beer
this
is
quite
quaffable
very
nice
i
have
a
had
alot
of
scotch
scottish
ale
this
winter
and
this
one
really
knocks
em
out
of
the
park
its
like
a
big
soulwarming
bear
hug
poured
a
dark
amberhued
caramel
color
slightly
hazy
thin
off
white
one
finger
head
fell
slowly
to
light
sticky
lacing
smell
is
sweet
and
malty
with
hints
of
caramel
toffee
and
a
slight
smell
of
alcohol
taste
is
primarily
sweet
malt
with
little
hops
present
in
the
background
hints
of
coffee
bittersweet
chocolate
also
slightly
smoky
excellent
level
of
complexity
mixed
with
suprising
drinkability
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
silky
smooth
somewhat
creamy
with
carbonation
on
the
lower
end
of
the
spectrum
drinkability
phenomenal
very
good
beer
easily
drinkable
would
seek
out
again
uf
smuggled
a
bottle
back
from
madison
in
my
luggage
picked
it
up
sort
of
as
an
afterthought
i
need
a
six
pack
of
this
scratch
that
i
need
a
constant
supply
cheers
jen
i
am
not
a
fan
of
scottish
ales
but
this
one
doesnt
seem
to
hit
as
much
of
a
sour
note
with
me
it
is
quite
malty
which
makes
this
somewhat
sweet
and
is
backed
by
the
mild
flavors
of
chocolate
it
has
a
barely
there
hoppy
ending
this
is
smooth
but
nothing
spectacular
d
after
a
quarter
of
the
beer
my
saliva
became
viscous
and
it
started
to
gather
in
the
back
of
my
throat
it
is
not
a
sessionable
beer
the
flavor
is
great
but
drinkable
it
is
not
as
a
big
fan
of
scottish
ales
i
was
eager
to
try
this
offering
from
three
floyds
the
dark
brown
color
is
very
inviting
for
drinkers
of
darker
ales
the
smell
is
pleasantly
malty
and
sweet
the
robust
flavor
smacks
of
a
combo
of
roasted
malts
and
chocolate
as
with
any
good
scottish
ale
this
one
succeeds
at
being
both
full
and
smooth
this
very
drinkable
beer
packs
a
punch
but
is
also
balanced
and
smooth
highly
recommended
especially
ontap
verdict
not
quite
as
chewy
as
other
scottish
ales
but
i
enjoyed
it
nonetheless
d
a
bit
filling
but
not
as
much
as
i
expected
if
you
couple
that
with
the
smoothness
and
its
more
drinkable
than
i
thought
it
would
be
but
after
a
few
bottles
you
may
feel
a
little
full
this
beer
might
be
something
that
is
better
to
drink
along
with
a
meal
im
not
much
of
a
cuisinepairingguy
so
i
have
no
idea
what
type
of
food
would
go
best
with
it
i
havent
had
any
beers
of
this
style
before
so
im
not
sure
how
much
this
beer
represents
the
style
honestly
speaking
i
did
like
the
beer
and
if
i
had
more
it
most
certainly
would
not
go
to
waste
however
there
are
other
beers
that
i
would
choose
over
this
one
d
havent
tried
scottish
ales
before
but
i
really
like
this
one
i
would
drink
it
again
this
is
one
of
the
best
scottish
ales
ive
ever
had
worth
trying
even
for
a
weissbier
golden
ale
lover
like
me
id
reccomend
it
d
nice
drinkability
not
too
overpowering
something
nice
to
relax
with
the
flavor
is
malty
a
bit
roasty
and
chocolatey
has
a
nice
toasted
malt
flavor
too
it
is
mediumfull
in
body
and
is
drying
in
the
finish
its
a
nice
drinker
nice
dark
carmel
color
in
the
glass
slight
head
that
quickly
dissipates
limited
lacing
sweet
raisin
and
carmel
aromas
somewhat
creamy
mouthfeel
slight
bitter
up
front
taste
gining
way
to
a
raisin
carmel
type
taste
and
finishing
with
a
sour
resin
taste
not
a
bad
beer
i
would
have
it
again
im
not
real
familiar
with
scottish
ales
but
i
will
tell
you
that
some
friends
and
i
drank
a
keg
of
robert
the
bruce
at
a
4th
of
july
party
and
were
out
trying
to
track
down
another
one
id
guess
thats
drinkability
deep
mahogany
in
color
there
was
a
very
small
head
when
poured
that
was
creamy
tan
in
color
and
disappeared
quickly
but
left
a
halo
that
provided
good
lacing
aromas
of
roasted
malts
malty
caramel
perfumy
hops
and
cinnamon
bread
sweet
on
the
taste
buds
caramel
flavors
with
raisins
and
finishes
a
little
bitter
with
the
taste
of
hops
there
was
just
a
hint
of
the
alcohol
as
swallowed
hard
to
believe
the
alcohol
content
was
9
this
was
one
of
the
smoothest
scotch
ales
ive
ever
had
creamy
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
yum
drinkability
three
floyds
has
once
again
made
a
dangerously
drinkable
brew
again
i
am
not
sure
if
they
hit
the
style
right
but
dam
is
it
good
i
was
expecting
something
a
bit
heavier
on
the
palate
for
this
beer
after
all
it
is
fairly
dark
despite
its
color
it
feels
fairly
light
on
the
palate
and
goes
down
like
water
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
that
compliments
the
malty
character
of
this
beer
not
hard
to
drink
at
all
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
and
i
can
see
myself
buying
more
of
this
in
the
future
in
brief
when
i
was
young
this
was
my
favorite
scotch
ale
then
i
discovered
the
great
dane
and
it
became
my
second
favorite
then
lake
louie
came
along
and
all
the
scotch
ales
on
earth
were
suddenly
less
than
adequate
today
this
one
hovers
high
on
the
drinkablility
list
but
low
in
all
other
categories
i
must
say
that
this
is
one
beer
that
is
certainly
more
desirable
on
tap
than
it
is
in
the
bottle
the
mouthfeel
alone
is
a
good
point
better
out
of
the
keg
one
other
particular
note
that
i
must
also
mention
is
that
it
has
a
nice
sage
brush
aroma
that
is
rare
in
a
scotch
ale
otherwise
this
is
a
strong
brown
ale
i
dont
find
much
strength
or
peat
in
it
the
alcohol
is
too
well
covered
it
reminds
me
not
of
scotland
or
any
other
scotch
ales
if
there
were
a
scotch
ale
light
this
would
be
it
it
is
quite
a
nice
beer
but
not
a
very
good
scotch
ale
that
being
said
i
still
enjoy
it
and
will
continue
to
drink
it
from
time
to
time
overall
great
example
of
style
any
maltbomb
lovers
will
enjoy
this
beer
through
and
through
grat
job
3
floyds
this
just
isnt
that
good
note
that
this
is
rated
within
the
style
but
its
too
flawed
and
boring
to
interest
me
in
drinking
more
of
it
probably
wont
purchase
again
but
overall
a
pretty
good
brew
taste
roasted
caramel
malts
theres
just
a
hint
of
chocolate
and
coffee
and
a
bit
of
a
hop
presence
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
overall
this
is
a
pretty
nice
easy
to
drink
beer
glad
i
picked
up
a
6er
of
this
a
nice
american
version
of
a
scottish
ale
easy
and
drink
and
pleasant
through
and
through
im
glad
i
picked
up
a
6er
of
this
one
overall
taste
was
just
what
i
expected
from
three
floyds
they
always
give
me
something
different
from
what
i
was
expecting
after
dinner
i
tried
this
three
floyds
brew
for
the
first
time
and
it
capped
off
the
meatloaf
very
well
for
a
scottish
ale
with
such
a
noticeable
roast
and
rich
malt
it
isnt
too
filling
that
you
dont
want
another
one
happy
to
have
met
this
one
drinkability
beautiful
amber
pour
with
hints
of
warm
oranges
and
autumn
reds
when
held
to
a
light
a
steady
stream
of
delicate
bubbles
flows
up
towards
a
thick
creamy
retentive
head
some
malts
smells
but
a
strong
floral
hoppy
scent
the
beer
is
somewhat
light
with
a
definate
roasted
malt
flavor
which
gives
way
to
a
hoppy
bitter
finish
alcohol
is
hidden
well
a
very
easy
drink
decent
scottish
ale
bottle
poured
a
brown
color
ale
with
a
medium
darkwhite
head
with
low
retention
aroma
of
hops
is
clearly
detectable
with
some
caramel
malt
taste
is
lighter
then
expected
with
some
caramel
malt
and
a
bitter
finish
watery
feel
at
the
end
is
very
unpleasant
body
is
definitely
too
thin
for
my
liking
and
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
definitely
not
the
best
from
3fl
and
not
even
close
to
the
best
of
the
style
d
goes
down
smooth
but
i
think
this
one
would
get
old
if
you
tried
to
drink
more
than
two
the
abv
also
must
be
watched
out
for
pours
a
reddishbrown
into
the
pint
glass
moderate
offwhite
head
aroma
is
surpringly
hoppy
i
figured
this
to
be
a
much
more
dominantly
malty
brew
taste
is
very
bittersweet
and
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
i
would
guess
more
around
67
not
9
great
blend
of
malt
hops
and
its
definitely
a
quality
scotch
ale
that
doesnt
skimp
on
flavor
nothing
mindblowing
but
definitely
another
solid
offering
from
fff
mouthfeeldrinkability
medium
bodied
with
good
smooth
carbonation
that
drinks
amazingly
easy
for
a
beer
at
9
this
makes
a
delicious
dessert
beer
that
could
accompany
chocolate
cake
or
tiramisu
as
i
am
getting
some
chocolate
flavors
now
too
what
a
surprise
i
had
no
idea
this
would
be
so
good
d
while
this
has
a
pretty
high
abv
and
slightly
bitter
i
could
see
this
being
a
close
to
regular
beer
it
is
a
solid
beer
to
drink
midway
through
you
session
and
doesnt
totally
kill
the
pallete
or
leave
you
fall
over
drunk
drinkablilty
just
like
my
last
scotch
ale
review
this
one
would
be
great
in
a
six
ounce
snifter
and
drinkable
like
wine
after
good
food
overall
disappointing
as
this
brew
has
a
lot
of
potential
lots
of
flavors
in
there
they
just
dont
seem
to
meld
well
together
carbonation
is
almost
nonexistent
as
well
so
close
to
being
excellent
in
many
points
but
just
missing
on
all
of
them
so
overall
just
average
this
brew
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
alarge
fluffy
white
head
the
aroma
is
malty
with
some
alcohol
peaking
through
the
taste
is
malty
but
not
very
strong
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
bodied
a
lot
little
than
other
wee
heavies
ive
had
overall
this
is
an
average
brew
at
best
there
are
a
lot
better
wee
heavies
to
be
had
worth
checking
out
if
youre
a
fan
of
the
style
and
want
a
brew
of
the
style
that
you
can
really
drink
the
beer
looked
reddish
amber
with
a
one
finger
thick
head
and
decent
lacing
the
smell
was
earthy
spicy
floral
nutty
and
slightly
smoky
the
taste
was
malty
sweet
and
chewy
and
continued
on
into
nutty
spicy
and
chalky
flavors
that
lingered
on
and
faded
into
peat
smoke
reminded
me
quite
a
bit
of
a
dopplebock
but
was
a
little
more
sour
the
mouthfeel
was
thick
and
sticky
and
aftertaste
soothingly
sweet
a
complex
beer
that
you
dont
have
to
sip
light
caramel
malt
flavors
dominate
a
bit
of
nuttiness
as
well
some
sweet
tea
notes
in
the
finish
tasty
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
thin
feeling
coats
the
mouth
well
but
dissapears
quickly
drinkability
is
good
due
to
the
good
overall
flavor
and
aroma
but
its
hard
to
drink
too
many
brews
with
this
octane
level
super
easy
to
drink
a
perfect
example
of
this
style
pours
a
crystal
clear
dark
amber
with
a
onefinger
offwhite
head
aroma
is
your
typical
weeheavy
caramel
malts
and
alcohol
with
condiderably
more
hoppy
spicyfloralness
taste
follows
the
same
pattern
sweet
caramel
malts
a
hint
of
chocolate
some
citrusy
fruit
and
a
nice
floral
hopalcohol
kick
at
the
end
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
as
well
a
very
drinkable
weeheavy
here
dangerously
so
for
9
a
solid
offering
from
3
floyds
here
and
also
my
first
drinkability
as
far
as
flavor
this
is
a
very
drinkable
brew
but
a
little
thick
to
be
drinking
more
than
a
couple
at
a
time
but
one
should
do
you
well
anyhow
12
oz
bottle
big
time
chocolate
and
roast
with
hops
in
the
background
to
keep
you
going
garnet
brown
and
red
tones
thin
tan
head
chocolate
and
roast
with
supporting
bitterness
flavor
seems
to
fade
as
beer
warms
too
much
carbonation
maybe
too
thin
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
but
best
characteristics
faded
as
the
beer
warmed
robert
is
a
muscular
chocolatey
brown
with
a
small
head
his
appearance
does
not
belie
his
overall
qualities
he
is
a
fine
manly
brew
yet
possesses
a
delicate
sweetness
hops
and
chocolate
dominate
his
delectable
odor
and
taste
and

on

poured
a

with
offwhite

that
fell
to
a
thin

smell
is
sweet
and
of
caramel
with
toatsed

and
vanilla
present
taste
is
is
sweet
caramel
and
nice
malty
texture
leaves
a
nice
sweet
taste
in
the
mouth
that
is
very
enjoyeable
very
good
drinkablilty
for
a
9
beer
overall
a
very
satisfying
experience
or
in
my
twoyearold
daughters
words
i
wike
dis
one
this
beer
means
a
lot
to
me
i
have
never
been
one
to
drink
beer
ever
not
even
in
college
never
liked
the
flavor
a
waiter
suggested
this
and
it
changed
how
i
look
at
beer
i
still
dont
like
major
brand
beers
and
i
still
would
rather
not
drink
those
but
beers
like
this
are
very
flavorful
and
enjoyable
it
is
this
very
beer
robert
the
bruce
which
made
it
so
i
can
appreciate
beer
it
has
been
my
all
time
favorite
my
cornerstone
beer
i
would
recommend
to
anybody
who
is
looking
for
a
nonmiller
to
give
this
a
try
caution
it
has
flavor
it
will
accost
the
taste
buds
of
those
who
like
lite
beers
for
me
that
is
what
beer
should
be
for
the
mouthfeel
is
also
worthy
of
an
upgradefrom
3
5
to
4
the
drinkability
is
average
although
when
paired
with
the
proper
food
i
could
see
it
getting
much
better
a
solid
4
beer
everything
about
it
was
right
on
for
a
strong
scottish
ale
a
deep
red
that
gave
it
a
beautiful
ruby
stained
glass
color
it
had
a
nose
of
toffee
candy
mixed
with
fresh
cracked
malt
it
wonderfully
hid
the
alcohol
and
was
a
delightful
drink
of
carmalized
wort
sugar
meet
with
a
light
touch
hop
spice
slgihtly
thin
body
that
lent
it
to
a
very
easy
drinkable
beer
as
smooth
as
the
body
is
i
would
rate
this
beer
as
easily
drinkable
i
will
buy
this
again
drinkability
not
my
favorite
style
of
brew
but
this
one
hits
home
as
one
of
the
better
ones
i
have
had
of
style
drinkability
this
beer
is
not
organized
enough
for
my
personal
preferences
it
just
does
not
have
any
solid
characters
that
would
lead
me
to
persue
another
glass
an
exercise
in
anonimity
in
my
opinion
decent
flavors
and
good
balance
although
a
little
rich
notes
a
strong
brew
in
the
alcoholic
sense
but
a
tad
thin
in
the
malt
department
with
the
loss
of
body
and
sweetness
oddly
this
adds
to
its
drinkability
more
of
a
double
brown
ale
imo
rather
than
a
scotch
ale
freeedooommmm
could
be
more
complex
in
finish
but
overall
wonderful
ive
been
hanging
onto
this
one
for
a
little
bit
now
and
i
think
its
about
time
i
imbibed
pours
a
thick
mahogany
with
a
surprising
amount
of
yeast
flowing
into
my
glass
as
well
not
what
i
expected
from
this
style
hardly
any
carbonation
or
head
rich
chocolatey
malt
aroma
which
follows
into
the
flavor
smooth
textured
mostly
from
the
lack
of
carbonation
makes
for
a
good
focus
on
the
sweet
malty
characteristics
of
this
one
i
thought
this
would
be
a
bit
hoppier
and
could
probably
use
a
tad
more
bitterness
for
balance
but
honestly
i
liked
it
the
way
it
is
quite
delicious
one
id
have
again
for
sure
beautiful
dark
mahogony
colour
with
a
thick
offwhite
head
lightly
spicy
on
the
nose
with
hints
of
brown
sugar
and
molasses
nutty
and
milkchocolatey
flavors
mix
with
a
strong
malt
presence
and
a
slight
orange
rind
bite
on
the
finish
fullbodied
but
never
heavy
or
cloying
a
fabulous
drink
i
have
read
the
reviews
no
answer
there
the
only
solution
to
the
problem
of
which
is
best
bottle
or
tap
is
further
research
lol
d
this
is
a
great
example
of
a
wee
heavy
and
has
the
good
rich
malt
complexity
it
has
a
nice
malt
flavor
with
hops
playing
in
the
background
the
smoky
flavor
is
very
faint
and
is
more
of
malt
that
taste
smoky
than
any
peat
smoke
very
well
put
together
beer
pours
a
muddy
dark
brown
color
with
thin
head
that
dissipates
to
a
fine
film
quickly
light
level
of
carbonation
very
sweet
smelling
molasses
and
chocolate
with
some
slight
hops
floral
citrus
overtones
sweet
taste
up
front
enough
bitterness
to
pucker
your
cheeks
a
little
if
you
hold
a
sample
in
your
mouth
but
generally
very
smooth
slightly
oily
mouthfeel
and
a
mediumheavy
body
high
abv
is
well
hidden
could
drink
too
many
of
these
pretty
easily
drinkability
very
drinkable
not
too
intimidating
given
the
abv
good
for
cooler
weather
as
its
a
bit
heavy
the
beer
pours
a
dark
amberbrown
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
dry
yet
malty
scent
that
boasts
of
crystal
and
roasted
malts
it
has
a
creamy
toastey
aroma
the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
very
smooth
malty
flavor
that
boasts
of
crystal
and
roasted
malts
it
has
a
dry
and
slightly
warm
finish
it
hides
the
elevated
abv
well
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
high
alcohol
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
great
it
is
a
mediumfull
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
good
scottish
ale
its
not
the
best
ive
had
but
it
drinks
well
12
oz
bottle
pours
dark
amber
almost
brown
with
a
huge
foamy
clingy
off
white
head
that
leaves
a
sticky
lacing
in
my
pint
glass
has
a
sweet
fruity
bready
and
citrusy
hoppy
aromas
nice
sweet
fruity
cherry
caramel
and
vanilla
flavors
nice
bittersweet
finish
medium
to
full
body
with
a
smooth
creamy
mouthfeel
hoppy
for
the
style
but
what
is
not
from
this
brewery
awards
gold
medal
1997
real
ale
fest
pours
a
dark
amber
copper
color
with
a
small
frothy
and
creamy
tan
head
toffee
and
caramel
nose
followed
up
with
a
citric
hop
profile
very
different
and
unusal
for
a
scotch
ale
but
hey
isnt
that
what
fff
is
all
about
spicy
and
woody
flavor
upfront
there
is
a
definite
alcohol
presence
but
its
not
offputting
at
all
hop
bitterness
is
definitely
noticable
unlike
most
other
examples
of
the
style
the
citrus
flavor
may
seem
out
of
place
at
first
but
once
used
to
it
it
seems
right
at
home
mouthfeel
is
medium
full
could
be
a
little
thicker
but
not
bad
highly
drinkable
for
the
9
abv
pours
a
deep
dark
garnet
like
a
juicy
pomegranate
no
head
nose
is
too
mild
expecting
a
heavier
maltiness
but
hey
ill
play
along
taste
is
oily
smooth
up
front
again
a
too
mild
maltiness
and
then
hops
not
pale
ale
hoppy
but
a
touch
of
hop
bite
interesting
like
a
hybrid
style
wee
hoppy
mouthfeel
is
medium
up
front
and
then
it
waters
down
in
the
finish
surprisingly
drinkable
just
dont
buy
this
expecting
a
typical
scotch
ale
this
is
my
second
three
floyds
behind
the
alpha
king
i
had
on
tap
a
few
months
ago
and
i
like
what
i
see
so
far
clear
cerise
color
with
a
thin
beige
head
and
very
small
yeast
particulate
floating
about
the
aroma
was
pure
malt
with
no
detectable
notes
of
hops
or
peat
the
peats
were
either
submerged
or
absent
to
the
taste
instead
i
tasted
a
slight
touch
of
vanilla
that
was
oddly
appealing
it
was
also
a
bit
sugary
with
low
co2
and
stray
lace
not
bottle
conditioned
anyone
who
enjoys
barreled
spirits
will
like
this
especially
scotch
highly
recommended
drinkability
a
very
drinkable
beer
with
some
wonderful
flavors
in
it
the
9
is
hidden
very
well
a
clean
dark
brown
beer
with
amber
highlights
has
a
big
foamy
beige
head
with
some
lace
a
nicely
sweet
aroma
of
chocolate
and
caramel
with
a
hint
of
spicey
hop
in
the
background
the
flavor
goes
from
a
milk
chocolate
character
to
some
light
caramel
to
a
bittersweet
chocolate
at
the
end
with
a
quick
dry
finish
overall
malty
and
thick
but
not
fantastic
kind
of
expensive
for
what
it
is
although
i
didnt
mind
drinking
it
this
one
is
definitely
an
easy
drinker
though
it
is
a
sipper
for
sure
id
be
happy
to
sample
it
again
i
was
expecting
something
more
than
what
came
across
to
me
its
like
requesting
a
luxury
rental
car
and
getting
stuck
with
a
vanilla
midsize
sedan
not
the
worst
fate
but
not
what
you
were
hoping
for
either
the
bulk
of
the
experience
was
tasty
but
once
the
main
part
of
the
flavor
fades
away
the
heavy
bitterness
takes
away
from
what
came
before
its
basically
drinkable
if
you
can
plow
past
that
lingering
distraction
you
dont
have
to
be
brave
of
heart
to
drink
this
but
keep
your
expectations
in
line
or
you
could
well
be
disappointed
dark
brown
with
a
light
colored
head
there
is
a
caramel
aroma
but
its
not
as
strong
as
in
most
scotch
ales
hops
aroma
as
well
which
seem
out
of
place
in
this
style
of
beer
the
flavor
starts
out
with
sweet
caramel
malt
but
quickly
becomes
very
bitter
with
hops
the
flavors
seem
to
clash
together
in
a
way
that
doesnt
work
well
not
much
roasted
flavor
medium
mouthfeel
not
a
bad
beer
just
pretty
average
medium
to
full
bodied
backwash
thats
two
disappointments
from
3
floyds
in
a
row
im
coming
to
the
conclusion
that
3
floyds
doesnt
really
do
great
versions
of
classic
uk
styles
or
chooses
an
iconoclastic
approach
which
i
dont
quite
appreciate
yet
like
the
alpha
klaus
porter
this
seemed
watery
and
overly
bitter
without
providing
the
hoppy
joys
of
dreadnaught
or
alpha
king
i
didnt
find
much
balance
or
the
expected
maltiness
in
this
beer
that
id
hoped
for
unlike
dark
lord
which
really
redefines
its
category
robert
the
bruce
just
seems
like
a
bit
of
a
failure
it
doesnt
seem
to
know
if
it
wants
to
be
a
new
world
hoppy
scotch
ale
at
which
it
fails
for
me
or
something
entirely
new
which
it
doesnt
seem
to
achieve
either
still
3
floyds
still
makes
some
stupendous
beers
and
i
look
forward
to
the
next
one
i
try
truly
a
nice
beer
the
assertive
hops
dont
seem
to
fit
in
with
the
classic
examples
ive
had
from
across
the
pond
but
i
find
the
hops
an
added
layer
of
excitement
maybe
not
as
complex
as
traquair
house
but
a
more
enjoyable
brew
for
me
thanks
to
cja711joe
for
the
tasty
beer
i
only
picked
up
a
single
since
i
am
hurting
for
cash
and
wanted
to
try
something
new
but
didnt
want
to
be
disappointed
with
a
whole
6
of
brews
i
most
certainly
could
have
drank
more
but
it
certainly
couldnt
stand
in
place
of
the
60
minute
ipa
which
i
have
developed
quite
a
strong
affinity
for
since
my
store
started
to
carry
it
i
picked
up
along
with
this
single
drinkabilitynotes
an
oustanding
example
of
the
style
highly
recommended
tastemouthfeeldrinkability
light
and
crisp
on
the
tip
of
the
tongue
with
a
decent
hoppiness
a
little
bit
weak
in
the
middle
for
a
scotch
ale
the
lightness
continues
through
through
the
finish
and
leaves
a
soft
malt
aftertaste
as
well
as
a
pleasant
albeit
understated
hoppiness
mouthfeel
is
very
nice
rolling
and
round
slightly
frothy
without
being
foamy
the
lack
of
thick
middle
is
uncharacteristic
for
this
style
but
makes
it
wasy
to
drink
overall
impression
a
unique
high
quality
flavor
with
a
great
finish
while
rich
tasting
the
moderate
body
would
make
me
think
about
a
possible
winter
session
another
really
good
beer
from
three
floyds
a
hearty
scottish
thanks
go
out
to
that
wee
lad
mattcrill
for
sending
another
tasty
brew
my
way
im
not
familiar
with
scottish
ales
my
preference
leaning
toward
ipas
that
said
i
found
a
lot
to
like
about
this
beer
nice
even
head
and
a
fruity
aroma
with
smoke
characteristic
of
scotch
i
should
have
guessed
as
much
mouthfeel
was
good
and
the
flavor
complex
tasting
like
it
smelled
roasted
grain
smoke
and
malt
although
less
than
i
would
have
expected
very
smooth
going
down
with
a
nice
light
dry
smoke
finish
i
guessed
6
abv
not
the
reported
9
so
this
one
could
definitey
sneak
up
on
you
very
nice
ill
have
to
explore
this
variety
of
beer
further
slàinte
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
tan
head
that
usually
goes
away
fairly
quickly
lots
of
malts
sweet
malts
some
chocolate
in
there
too
but
not
much
basically
malts
with
a
nice
hop
aftertaste
that
doesnt
rip
your
tongue
off
like
everything
else
fff
brews
highly
recommended
this
is
the
staple
beer
at
most
of
my
friends
and
is
parties
in
the
winter
drinkability
and
overall
wow
this
was
a
dissapointing
beer
hopefully
this
was
just
a
bad
bottle
or
something
but
this
was
rough
not
the
quality
id
except
from
fff
i
have
one
more
im
going
to
throw
in
the
cellar
for
a
bit
to
see
if
it
evens
things
out
at
all
hopefully
it
does
cause
this
brew
needs
it
drinkable
bottle
but
had
on
tap
at
isaac
newtons
recently
as
well
the
tap
version
seemed
hoppier
anyway
deep
brick
red
with
a
thin
tan
head
and
clear
very
malty
aroma
that
includes
carmel
malts
and
fruitiness
reminds
me
somewhat
of
stone
8th
but
i
digress
flavor
is
big
and
malty
with
darker
malts
coming
through
and
a
pleasant
hop
bitterness
coming
out
from
underneath
smooth
and
drinkable
a
little
hop
bitterness
and
flavor
lingers
in
the
finish
i
think
i
like
the
bottle
better
i
havent
had
a
lot
of
scotch
ales
so
i
dont
have
a
lot
to
compare
this
to
i
was
expecting
more
of
a
malt
presence
that
really
didnt
show
this
beer
was
done
really
well
but
it
didnt
blow
me
away
or
anything
still
its
worth
trying
once
3fs
never
disappoints
pours
a
deep
copper
color
with
an
light
tan
head
that
subsides
to
an
even

layer
of
foam
excellent
retention
lacing
moderate
earthy
and
malty
nose
with
moderate
hoppy
notes
especially
for
a
scotch
ale
strong
malty
chocolatey
notes
with
an
herbal
hoppy
astringency
that
lasts
well
into
the
finish
and
aftertaste
im
not
really
sure
ive
ever
had
a
scotch
ale
this
hoppy
a
good
winter
warmer
very
tasty
and
extremely
enjoyable
mouthfeeldrinkability
this
is
nice
and
not
too
heavy
or
viscous
the
carbonation
suits
this
wonderfully
drinkable
i
suppose
so
but
again
i
dont
typically
toss
back
more
than
one
scotch
ale
and
i
might
not
look
for
another
of
these
very
nice
though
the
9
is
very
well
hidden
amongst
the
maltiness
if
only
3fs
products
were
cheaper
at
least
the
distribution
is
starting
to
come
around
here
on
the
east
coast
drinkability
is
good
strange
to
smeel
and
taste
a
noticable
hop
presence
in
a
scotch
ale
but
that
make
this
one
good
in
my
opinon
thanks
to
merlin48
for
providing
this
sample
a
favorable
beer
that
can
be
handled
fairly
easily
but
after
a
couple
it
may
start
to
effect
the
noggin
as
the
9
is
hidden
very
well
a
deep
brownish
red
with
a
fizzy
white
head
a
little
lacing
can
be
seen
on
the
glass
a
slight
grassiness
to
the
smell
there
are
plenty
of
hops
here
the
taste
starts
off
a
little
bitter
some
good
hops
in
there
it
quickly
changes
to
a
smooth
maltiness
with
the
slightest
hint
of
chocolate
and
finishes
smoothly
with
some
alcohol
aftertaste
there
is
a
roasted
malt
flavor
that
shines
through
although
the
alcohol
is
noticeable
it
is
a
pretty
good
blend
of
malt
and
hops
a
good
ale
mildly
crisp
at
the
start
and
finish
malt
and
caramel
flavors
last
on
the
tongue
superb
drinkability
even
with
the
higher
alcohol
levels
oddly
i
recently
had
this
beer
on
tap
at
the
brewery
and
found
it
quite
lacking
in
the
bottle
its
much
better
beer
poured
a
reddish
brown
amber
color
decent
head
that
disappated
after
a
few
minutes
a
similar
beer
to
skullsplitter
but
with
noticably
more
hops
not
a
very
heavy
aftertaste
which
was
welcome
not
bitter
at
all
i
was
suprised
that
a
micro
brew
here
in
america
could
create
such
a
refreshing
tasty
scottish
ale
i
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
a
surprising
combination
of
malts
hops
barley
in
a
scotch
aroma
chicory
and
roasted
malt
doesnt
all
quite
work
out
that
great
but
different
as
you
would
expect
from
this
brewery
layers
of
taste
that
evolve
as
you
work
through
the
bottle
mild
taste
medium
to
even
thin
mouthfeel
barley
doesnt
work
all
that
great
in
it
like
a
homebrew
bitter
aftertaste
needs
food
to
offset
thanks

the
beer
dispenses
from
the
12ounce
brown
bottle
a
deep
amber
to
almost
brown
color
with
a
meaningful
sized
frothy
head
that
slowly
evaporates
leaving
a
fine
coating
of
lace
upon
the
glass
nose
is
sweet
with
malt
hints
of
hops
and
a
bit
of
fusel
alcohol
fresh
and
appealing
the
start
nicely
malted
and
somewhat
sweet
top
is
middling
in
feel
to
the
palate
finish
is
delightfully
carbonated
and
the
hops
delectable
in
their
spiciness
dry
linger
aftertaste
a
fine
drinking
beer
just
wish
three
floyds
were
more
readily
available
here
in
arizona
this
beer
pours
a
reddish
brown
color
with
a
light
brown
head
smell
is
slightly
smoky
and
has
notes
of
alcohol
and
some
bitter
hops
flavor
has
a
different
malty
taste
i
get
some
english
toffee
in
here
but
its
not
straight
up
its
more
like
the
result
of
the
malts
and
hops
mixing
together
also
the
alcohol
really
seems
apparent
to
me
but
oddly
this
was
quite
drinkable
there
was
a
lack
of
complete
malt
substance
and
the
alcohol
seemed
to
take
its
place
body
is
a
bit
weak
but
somewhat
creamy
as
well
a
bit
of
an
odd
beer
but
one
that
i
dont
mind
still
not
the
best
scotch
ale
beer
is
good
happy
wee
heavy
beering
starts
with
light
whiskey
and
peat
malt
flavors
at
midpalate
a
wisp
of
smoke
and
butter
cookies
come
in
lightly
bitter
tang
carries
on
into
the
malty
finish
nice
mediumbig
bodied
creamy
feel
the
aroma
is
sweet
smelling
and
a
tad
hoppy
there
are
also
hints
of
coffee
and
maltiness
the
taste
is
at
first
kind
of
nutty
followed
by
a
week
coffee
the
aftertaste
is
very
malty
and
dry
but
smooth
with
the
9
alcohol
i
expected
more
in
the
taste
but
it
was
noticable
yet
not
overwhelming
this
brewwhich
i
was
thankful
to
find
at
my
local
bar
here
in
wyndmoor
pastruck
me
as
very
much
modeled
after
the
mcewans
scotch
alealthough
i
might
grant
it
the
edge
in
terms
of
drinkability
and
mouthfeel
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
flute
glass
it
pours
a
deep
brown
color
with
two
fingers
of
head
there
is
almost
no
lacing
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
full
of
roasted
malt
bits
of
toffee
sweetness
and
some
alcohol
the
taste
is
also
heavy
on
the
malt
it
has
some
caramel
sweetness
and
a
bit
of
molasses
a
little
bit
of
alcohol
on
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
very
nice
thick
yet
smooth
the
drinkability
is
good
for
a
9
brew
a
sweet
beer
from
three
floyds
p
s
i
found
this
in
a
little
gas
stationbeer
store
that
i
always
stop
in
here
in
statesboro
dont
ask
me
how
they
got
this
i
havent
even
seen
this
in
atlanta
and
im
sure
3f
doesnt
normally
distribute
here
not
much
i
can
say
except
that
this
is
a
great
beer
its
very
easy
to
drink
and
youd
never
know
by
the
taste
that
abv
is
so
high
a
definite
winner
next
time
around
ill
have
to
pick
up
more
than
one
bottle
a
very
drinkable
beer
hard
to
beleive
it
is
9
abv
drinks
easier
than
a
lot
of
5percenters
in
the
same
style
this
beer
will
quickly
find
a
spot
in
my
fridge
on
a
semi
regular
basis
this
beer
pours
a
nice
deep
ruby
brown
color
there
is
no
head
to
speak
of
the
nose
is
nice
roasted
malts
a
little
bit
of
caramel
a
litle
bit
of
lightly
roasted
coffee
the
flavor
on
this
one
is
fairly
roasty
nice
deep
caramel
just
beautiful
the
aftertaste
is
really
nice
caramel
sweetness
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
but
the
flavor
makes
up
for
it
drinkability
is
phenominal
thanks
to
clvand0
for
bringing
this
one
by
3fs
robert
the
bruce
is
quite
quaffable
and
its
hard
to
believe
the
abv
is
as
high
as
listed
here
the
alcohol
is
very
well
disguised
smooth
well
balanced
and
sporting
a
robust
and
varied
taste
robert
the
bruce
is
a
tasty
brew
worth
trying
out
im
not
a
scottish
ale
fan
at
all
but
this
one
is
a
good
example
a
dark
ruby
transparent
with
an
off
white
head
smell
is
malts
which
i
use
to
love
but
cant
stand
too
of
much
these
days
it
does
have
good
hop
flavor
as
good
as
a
scottish
ale
gets
it
hides
its
abv
well
i
just
noticed
that
its
9
and
have
decided
i
should
only
have
one
and
switch
if
you
like
scottish
ales
im
sure
youd
love
this
one
mouthfeel
is
nice
possibly
a
little
too
light
but
it
goes
down
smooth
and
is
easy
to
drink
this
is
9
abv
and
i
can
hardly
even
tell
drinkability
is
good
as
well
i
could
definetly
down
a
good
23
of
these
babies
when
i
want
a
nice
chage
of
pace
and
nice
malty
brew
i
will
turn
to
my
new
friend
robert
the
bruce
a
good
beer
admittedly
i
have
little
experience
with
the
style
but
i
liked
this
one
enough
if
i
could
ask
for
anything
it
would
probably
be
a
little
more
hearty
of
a
mouthfeel
pours
a
dark
carmel
color
with
a
sizeable
head
at
first
that
works
down
to
a
think
one
quickly
aroma
of
lightly
roasted
malts
mostly
slight
raisin
tint
to
it
as
well
taste
of
slightly
smokey
malt
blending
into
huge
malt
ending
with
a
pretty
big
hop
burst
for
the
style
i
like
this
beer
alcohol
is
hidden
fairly
well
for
what
it
is
and
its
a
easy
drinker
perhaps
my
favorite
from
3f
this
poured
out
a
light
brown
with
a
strong
reddish
hue
when
the
light
hit
it
it
had
a
decent
sized
beige
head
form
that
dropped
quickly
leaving
sticky
sheets
of
lace
to
decorate
the
glass
very
strong
chocolate
malty
smell
rises
from
the
glass
that
is
backed
by
a
slightly
sweet
fruit
presence
the
warmer
the
brew
gets
the
more
the
chocolate
seems
to
stand
front
and
center
there
are
also
notes
of
a
slight
earthy
hoppiness
that
seem
to
emerge
now
and
then
the
sweet
malt
hits
the
palette
first
with
ripe
dark
fruitiness
that
seems
covered
in
a
slightly
bitter
dark
chocolate
there
is
a
bittersweet
aftertaste
that
is
pleasant
and
lasts
for
a
while
alcohol
adds
a
little
bite
that
comes
out
when
it
warms
mouthfeel
is
about
medium
with
good
carbonation
and
a
smooth
feel
over
the
tongue
drinkability
is
good
this
goes
down
easy
and
i
could
definitely
handle
a
few
more
all
in
all
a
pretty
good
interpretation
of
the
style
from
three
floyds
that
i
would
recommend
you
try
if
you
havent
i
love
deep
complex
nutty
flavored
brews
and
the
bruce
doesnt
disappoint
i
think
the
taste
is
well
balanced
considering
the
alcohol
content
and
a
couple
of
these
will
ease
your
pain
quickly
especially
after
work
on
friday
an
outstanding
beer
at
a
reasonable
price

a
sixer
in
chicagoland
i
also
love
three
floyds
label
artwork
in
general
and
robert
the
bruce
in
particular
this
has
been
a
staple
of
mine
for
at
least
a
year
and
i
just
now
realized
that
ive
never
properly
reviewed
this
beer
it
pours
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
quickly
disappearing
tan
head
aroma
is
wonderful
notes
of
chocolate
and
a
little
bit
of
roasted
malt
very
pleasant
just
to
sit
and
sniff
taste
belies
the
aroma
as
a
nice
malty
backbone
is
present
but
notes
of
chocolate
are
notably
absent
there
is
also
a
nice
hop
bite
to
this
brew
which
hides
any
evidence
at
all
of
alcohol
body
seems
a
little
bit
thinner
than
what
i
was
expecting
this
beer
seems
to
be
straddleing
the
line
between
a
heavy
desert
bit
and
a
malty
session
beer
for
me
its
a
perfect
complement
to
my
u2
elevation
dvd
in
the
background
and
i
definately
will
be
seeing
more
of
this
brew
in
my
future
pours
a
light
brown
and
orange
color
with
a
tan
head
that
sticks
around
but
leaves
no
lacing
nice
aroma
strong
in
the
malt
area
and
some
smoky
essence
and
chocolate
roastedness
extremely
smooth
flavor
chocolate
is
the
dominant
characteristic
but
there
is
also
some
smokiness
and
a
slight
hint
of
alcohol
this
is
a
very
wellmade
beer
poured
a
medium
brown
with
red
highlights
not
much
head
or
lace
smell
of
roasted
malt
with
some
vanilla
and
coffee
taste
is
a
sweet
roasted
malt
with
coffee
vanilla
and
alcohol
coming
through
a
lightporter
if
there
is
such
a
thing
that
is
except
for
the
alcohol
content
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
heavy
for
me
but
is
good
for
the
style
its
more
of
a
nice
cool
autumn
night
kind
of
a
beer
since
it
is
a
bit
heavy
it
does
not
have
great
drinkability
its
more
a
a
hang
out
and
savor
type
give
it
a
try
if
you
get
a
chance
sampled
from
a
12
oz
bottle
appearance
is
very
dark
with
a
reddish
brown
tint
this
bad
boy
smells
of
caramel
dark
roasted
malts
im
tasting
a
little
caramel
and
a
touch
of
toffee
flavor
making
it
a
bit
sweet
there
are
also
some
subtle
but
distinguishable
hop
flavors
coming
through
making
this
brew
a
bit
more
unique
medium
to
full
bodied
quite
flavorful
on
the
sweet
side
but
relatively
easy
drinking
overall
an
enjoyable
take
on
the
style
nice
final
thought
this
is
quite
a
remarkable
final
product
my
first
brew
from
three
floyds
and
definately
not
the
last
i
thank
the
providers
of
the
midwest
taster
for
this
addition
i
am
a
big
fan
of
this
beer
it
has
a
level
of
chocolate
and
coffee
flavor
usually
reserved
for
much
heavier
stouts
and
manages
to
generate
those
flavors
without
becoming
too
bitter
much
more
subtle
than
other
similar
scotch
ales
i
e
dirty
bastard
this
beer
has
a
complex
taste
with
chocolate
scotch
malt
and
hops
all
playing
off
each
other
the
color
is
a
dark
reddish
brown
high
carbonation
and
smooth
going
down
this
beer
hits
all
the
marks
it
could
have
more
of
a
nose
though
thanks
to
deejaydan
for
the
sample
dark
brown
in
the
glass
kind
of
translucent
good
chewy
maltiness
heavy
burnt
malt
but
quite
a
good
selection
of
malts
make
it
a
great
balance
not
much
notice
of
hops
but
they
are
there
in
the
background
i
could
probably
drink
this
all
day
id
love
to
try
this
on
tap
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
a
14
beige
head
over
the
reddish
brown
brew
and
laced
okay
slight
aroma
of
sweet
dark
malts
with
a
slightly
apparent
smoke
component
which
is
as
a
scottish
ale
should
be
as
noted
in
my
ontap
review
nice
to
see
the
ontap
and
bottled
presentation
be
similar
taste
followed
the
noses
lead
with
the
smokieness
a
bit
more
prominent
alcohol
not
noted
in
the
taste
but
the
lipsmacking
stickness
illustrates
that
its
in
there
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
great
for
the
style
so
i
bought
another
6er
recently
and
its
no
where
enar
what
it
was
possible
bad
batch
it
was
more
barley
winesque
then
anything
and
was
plain
harsh
in
the
mouth
i
dropped
my
scores
based
on
that
it
was
harsher
but
still
was
a
good
beer
just
not
as
enjoyable
as
my
first
tasting
i
will
try
anything
by
three
floyds
and
i
could
drink
several
of
these
but
given
the
choice
of
an
ipa
stout
or
porter
i
would
probably
choose
those
especially
three
floyds
alpha
king
overall
definitely
a
quality
brew
and
exceedingly
drinkable
considering
its
alcoholic
content
i
feel
like
i
could
drink
this
one
all
night
if
i
were
so
inclined
i
will
definitely
make
a
habit
of
keeping
this
one
stocked
in
the
beer
fridge
plenty
of
hops
plenty
of
malt
plenty
of
flavor
i
love
this
beer
perfect
for
an
evening
by
the
fire
well
it
sure
smells
hoppy
dont
know
why
hop
flavor
and
bitterness
is
strongly
evident
also
the
malt
flavor
is
barely
there
with
a
slight
carmel
flavor
mediocre
beer
but
a
crap
scotch
ale
it
ssems
to
be
lacking
all
the
good
qualities
of
the
style
and
throwing
in
a
few
bad
traits
from
others
too
i
wish
they
had
called
it
something
else
so
i
could
have
avoided
wasting
my
time
what
the
heck
am
i
going
to
do
with
the
other
5
i
really
like
this
a
lot
just
short
of
being
outstanding
i
would
buy
this
again
if
i
ever
see
it
recommended
if
you
like
this
style
alcohol
is
not
noticable
wish
it
was
just
a
bit
beefier
overall
a
good
sipping
beer
and
i
will
probably
order
again
believe
it
or
not
robert
the
bruce
is
only
the
second
scottish
ale
that
ive
ever
had
im
not
sure
if
my
lack
of
enthusiasm
its
good
but
not
great
is
because
i
dont
care
for
the
style
or
because
it
isnt
a
great
representation
of
that
style
only
one
way
to
find
out
drink
more
beer
what
a
great
idea
as
for
taste
very
hoppy
at
room
temperature
i
could
only
enjoy
the
hoppiness
for
about
half
the
beer
but
slightly
chilled
the
hoppiness
was
very
nice
till
the
last
drop
and
the
feeling
the
highgravity
leaves
on
your
tounge
compliments
the
fruity
aftertaste
an
exotic
beer
almost
spicy
a
manly
adventure
well
advised
drinkability
excellent
for
a
scotch
ale
due
to
subdued
alcohol
prsence
quite
smooth
drinking
this
beer
could
easily
get
you
in
to
trouble
though
quickly
resembles
some
of
the
barley
wine
that
ive
tasted
again
probably
because
the
9
abv
but
with
much
more
malt
and
roasted
flavor
while
this
isnt
my
favorite
beer
to
date
its
nontheless
a
good
one
the
color
is
a
beautiful
dark
mahogany
that
is
clear
and
has
a
thin
tan
head
the
aroma
is
malty
with
a
little
bit
of
everything
caramel
nuttiness
smokiness
and
slight
chocolate
except
that
there
is
no
discernable
hops
the
body
is
malty
yet
it
seems
a
bit
thin
for
the
style
it
is
slightly
smokey
and
nutty
with
a
sweet
fruity
finish
the
carbonation
is
a
bit
too
much
and
there
is
also
a
tinge
of
alcohol
throughout
but
overall
an
enjoyable
brew
drinkability
good
scottish
ale
id
buy
it
again
a
style
that
im
beginning
to
enjoy
more
overall
a
good
beer
that
i
will
probably
buy
again
extra
smooth
and
silky
in
the
mouth
with
light
carbonation
so
smooth
and
tasty
it
goes
down
with
no
effort
a
delightful
brew
nice
looking
mahogany
tone
to
this
brew
thin
creamy
beige
head
lacing
is
adequate
nose
is
smokey
and
chocolatey
some
roasted
grain
in
the
background
as
well
pretty
nice
theres
a
nice
charred
malt
presence
on
the
palate
with
some
peaty
and
bittersweet
tones
as
well
taste
is
very
nice
nice
chocolate
characteristic
just
damn
smooth
and
enjoyable
beer
had
extremely
low
carbonation
which
i
thought
suited
the
style
very
well
the
mouthfeel
was
a
combination
of
smooth
and
oily
that
was
fine
easy
enough
beer
to
drink
but
im
not
sure
you
would
consider
this
one
a
session
beer
this
brew
is
a
deep
mahogany
color
with
a
thin
dark
beige
head
fair
lacing
heavy
malt
in
the
nose
along
with
sweet
caramel
and
a
touch
of
chocolate
rich
bodied
just
how
i
like
my
scottish
ales
with
flavors
of
malt
caramelbutterscotch
and
chocolate
the
finish
is
lightly
bitter
with
hops
and
a
touch
of
coffee
pretty
good
a
scotch
ale
on
crack
which
is
what
3
floyds
is
all
about
a
very
solid
beer
and
id
love
to
have
some
of
this
again
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
the
flavor
is
certainly
there
but
not
in
your
face
pours
a
deep
amberbrown
with
a
pretty
thin
head
that
is
gone
pretty
quickleya
subtle
aroma
of
alcoholcaramel
and
a
little
earthiness
taste
is
mildy
sweet
and
pretty
earthy
for
a
scottish
ale
with
a
raisin
like
finish
and
aftertaste
a
pretty
thin
compared
to
many
scottish
ales
i
think
but
still
pretty
good
and
highly
drinkable
for
the
style
the
halfbrother
of
the
alpha
king
the
caramel
malts
cause
an
exceptional
smoothness
to
this
ale
it
just
plain
feels
good
to
drink
the
nose
is
all
malt
and
caramel
the
same
flavor
is
what
hits
first
in
the
midst
there
is
good
hopping
for
a
scotch
ale
id
expect
nothing
less
from
the
floyds
finally
the
beer
gives
way
to
the
malts
again
which
just
hang
at
the
back
of
the
throat
this
beer
could
cure
many
an
affliction
one
of
my
absolute
favorite
scotch
ales
pours
out
to
a
dark
brown
to
almost
black
in
the
glass
with
a
light
head
the
aroma
reminds
me
of
liquor
specifically
bourbonscotchwhiskey
the
taste
is
good
with
a
fruitlike
presence
coming
to
the
forefront
mainly
plum
and
raisinlike
the
finish
is
decent
but
there
is
a
bit
of
alcohol
present
on
the
swallow
that
isnt
fully
masked
pours
with
a
thin
light
brown
head
the
beer
itself
is
a
deep
amberred
color
and
is
pretty
clear
aromas
of
dark
fruit
malt
and
a
hint
of
alcohol
waft
from
my
glass
the
taste
is
sweet
malty
and
fruity
as
well
some
of
the
fruit
seems
to
be
hop
derived
though
the
hops
are
fairly
subtle
here
there
is
a
hint
of
roast
malt
in
the
finish
which
adds
a
nice
stylistic
touch
this
is
quite
a
malty
brew
with
notes
of
caramelized
malt
cherries
and
raisins
this
is
most
definitely
a
good
straight
forward
example
of
a
scottish
ale
glassy
deep
garnet
hue
lean
but
steadfast
light
beige

leaves
sparse

deep
dark

toffeeish

surface
after
a
deliberation
trace
minty
ethanol
upon
swirling
stately

in
flavor
the
prevalent
malt
impression
is
of
slightly
burnt
well
buttered
toffee
savory
salted
biscuit
undertone
offers
contrast
hop
bitterness
is
comparatively
high
for
style
but
serves
to
offset
malt
sweetness
and
facilitate
dryness
conducive
to
dangerous
drinkability
ashen
pine
wood
hop
flavor
thinnish
in

with
a
lanky
dilute
mouthfeel
that
falls
a

fruitiness
of
a
singed

nature
develops
as
the
beer
breathes
finishes
with
lingering
hints
of

drizzled

yet
oddly
remains
dry
with

warmth
a
scotch
ale
with
a
definite
american
flare
a
bit
over
attenuated
and
shy
in
malt
depth
but
certainly
fits
the
bill
as
a
fine
american
strong
ale
quite
tasty
and
superbly
drinkable
indeed
thanks
to
kennywoodbrew
for
the
delivery
i
once
had
this
at
their
brewery
and
enjoyed
it
then
as
far
as
i
can
tell
this
is
the
same
beer
i
remember
a
quality
scotch
ale
and
as
the
the
style
goes
one
of
my
favorites
thanks
to
qarre
for
the
beer
dark

a
medium
bodied
scotch
ale
malts
are
nutty
and
sweet
with
a
touch
of
peatiness
its
very
hoppy
for
a
scotch
ale
yet
its
not
at
all
bitter
extremely
smooth
with
a
nice
sweet
finish
hides
the

very
well
an
eminently
drinkable
ale
mouthfeel

full
and
round
finish

and
smooth
aftertaste
is
slightly
sweet
overall
a
good
scotch
ale
big
thanks
to
twelvevoltman
for
the
bottle
update

i
originally
received
this
back
in
2003
in
my
first
ever
bif
and
was
lucky
enough
to
get
a
bottle
of
2006
vintage
from
beerguy
the
only
thing
that
struck
me
differently
is
that
it
looks
so
much
better
it
looked
good
before
but
now
the
head
was
just
perfect
just
offwhite
retentive
and
depositing
some
of
the
coolest
lacing
i
have
ever
seen
im
raising
the
appearance
to
a
perfect
5
0
and
calling
it
a
day
cheers
to
frank
very
very
drinkable
why
cant
3fs
be
a
maine
beer
company
its
not
too
late
to
relocate
deep
mahogany
color
with
a
light
fluffy
head
smells
of
sweet
grapes
and
a
light
smokey
aroma
sweeter
malts
are
also
clear
this
is
a
smooth
beer
with
a
medium
body
there
are
flavors
of
chocolate
and
a
cake
like
feel
nice
blend
of
hops
and
a
generous
amount
for
this
style
all
the
flavors
work
very
well
together
the
aftertaste
is
a
crisp
dry
taste
with
a
great
finish
i
didnt
know
this
was
a
9
brew
until
i
checked
out
the
website
very
well
hidden
all
together
a
solid
beer
the
bruce
produces
a
medium
size
head
that
dissipates
pretty
quickly
it
is
a
deep
deep
amber
color
maroon
even
the
smell
was
interesting
a
bit
hard
to
describe
to
my
uninitiated
nose
i
could
detect
a
vaguely
coffee
scent
and
it
was
somewhat
fruity
taking
a
sip
yields
a
very
very
smooth
mouthfeel
the
beer
felt
deceptivly
thin
for
such
a
dark
beer
the
taste
was
mellow
slightly
malty
but
lacking
in
any
real
punchthere
were
no
overpowering
tastes
and
by
the
time
it
is
on
its
way
down
your
throat
you
are
a
bit
pressed
to
describe
exactly
what
it
tastes
like
it
is
so
smooth
that
you
could
drink
quite
a
fewand
then
be
flat
on
your
back
because
this
bad
boy
packs
a
punch
definatly
will
have
to
have
a
few
more
of
these
just
to
make
sure
i
gave
the
beer
its
proper
due
deep
copper
in
color
with
bubbles
that
cling
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
good
sized
offwhite
frothy
head
that
dissipates
slowly
to
a
good
lace
big
malty
aroma
that
has
notes
of
caramel
and
sweet
bread
only
a
hint
of
hops
in
noticeable
on
the
nose
rich
sweet
malty
brew
with
a
nice
medium
mouthfeel
and
soft
carbonation
some
hop
spiciness
picks
up
towards
the
end
along
with
some
roasted
notes
the
finish
has
notes
smoke
that
last
through
the
aftertaste
just
a
touch
warming
at
the
end
i
really
enjoyed
this
scotch
ale
very
drinkable
and
well
balanced
ill
look
for
this
one
again
12
oz
bottle
poured
a
hazy
dark
amber
with
a
decent
head
and
some
fine
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
of
roasted
malt
with
a
slight
hint
of
hops
taste
is
again
more
of
the
same
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
but
it
is
my
first
scottish
style
ale
so
it
is
hard
to
rate
it
against
style
but
i
know
what
i
like
and
this
i
like
pours
a
glowing
brown
with
marron
highlights
delicious
white
had
is
formed
with
a
little
help
aroma
is
sweet
malt
subtle
peat
and
eath
and
some
spiciness
taste
is
full
caramel
and
toffe
malt
that
the
color
would
indicate
with
a
little
spicy
zing
on
the
back
end
that
is
a
little
scotch
and
a
little
bit
spice
feels
very
smmoth
in
the
mouth
and
really
hides
the
relatively
high
alcohol
kind
of
scary
in
fact
because
these
go
down
easy
too
easy
set
em
up
joe
nice
amber
color
with
a
light
tan
head
that
kept
its
presence
for
a
little
bit
a
good
amount
of
bottom
carbonation
nice
nutty
and
breadlike
aroma
this
has
a
nice
flavor
compared
to
many
scottish
ales
i
taste
a
tiny
bit
of
caramel
with
the
first
sip
the
alcohol
is
not
overpowering
but
you
are
aware
that
it
is
there
it
has
a
dry
finish
and
an
overall
nice
mouthfeel
this
beer
but
would
not
choose
to
drink
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
pours
a
clear
deep
brownish
copper
with
a
light
tan
head
aroma
consists
of
chocolate
malt
roasted
coffee
caramel
in
addition
to
hops
buried
underneath
it
all
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
coarsely
carbontated
almost
to
the
point
that
it
detracts
from
the
drinkability
not
smooth
all
some
hop
bitterness
and
bitter
chocolate
on
the
tongue
finishes
with
flavors
of
roasted
malt
and
a
dry
lingering
hop
bitterness
not
as
complex
as
i
expected
and
hoppier
that
i
had
hoped
this
is
the
2nd
offering
ive
had
from
3fs
and
so
far
i
havent
been
that
impressed
unfortunately
also
this
beers
reminscence
to
cocacola
is
not
appreciated
drinkability
noy
my
style
but
if
you
are
a
malt
lover
try
this
one
when
you
can
i
got
to
have
this
straight
from
the
brewery
tap
of
all
the
regular
3
floyds
beers
this
is
the
one
thats
not
insanely
hopped
rather
you
have
a
nice
roasty
malt
flavor
just
a
trace
of
smokiness
a
big
big
malt
taste
but
one
that
doesnt
leave
any
aftertaste
in
other
words
smooth
as
pudding
thanks
to
san
diegos
finest
ba
xlperro
for
this
one
deep
mahogany
in
color
little
head
or
lace
present
aroma
is
sweet
caramel
and
mild
hop
tones
citrus
pine
are
noted
the
taste
is
smooth
malt
tones
with
that
mild
sweetness
coming
into
play
but
that
is
about
it
nothing
really
going
on
with
this
beer
it
seems
to
be
lacking
more
flavors
it
just
starts
to
get
interesting
then
comes
to
a
quick
stop
yea
you
could
drink
this
all
night
but
with
the
missing
flavor
why
do
it
overall
it
is
ok
overall
a
very
nice
experience
wish
i
had
brought
several
more
of
these
home
but
all
in
all
a
very
drinkable
strong
beer
12oz
bottle
fresh
from
the
brewery
dark
amber
with
a
small
head
that
dies
down
quickly
nutty
malty
sweet
aroma
and
smelling
really
fresh
smooth
body
with
a
big
malt
feel
hops
are
there
but
ever
so
gently
so
not
to
overpower
the
terrific
malt
blend
flavor
leans
towards
a
roasted
malt
yet
i
taste
a
subtle
hint
of
cocoa
in
there
not
anything
like
most
other
scottish
ales
which
i
find
too
malty
and
sweet
this
one
is
really
quite
nice
in
my
opinion
really
fresh
tasting
a
much
better
example
of
the
style
since
i
last
tried
it
three
floyds
seems
to
have
toned
down
the
hops
to
within
something
youd
recognize
as
a
scotch
ale
very
nice
ng
this
beer
is
a
dark
redbrown
color
with
a
tan
head
that
crumbles
down
to
nothing
quickly
the
nose
is
a
nice
caramel
scent
as
for
the
taste
it
is
mainly
a
malty
caramel
character
with
a
slight
chocolate
taste
mixed
in
this
is
my
first
scottish
style
ale
so
i
am
not
the
best
one
to
compare
it
to
the
rest
of
the
field
but
i
think
this
is
a
pretty
nice
drink
this
is
probably
the
worst
scotch
ale
that
i
have
ever
had
yet
its
not
too
bad
either
its
pretty
much
like
a
lighter
mcewans
scotch
ale
the
color
was
pretty
much
average
but
with
a
little
bit
more
red
color
to
it
the
head
was
light
and
died
out
quickly
which
is
a
bad
thing
in
my
book
i
guess
the
cool
thing
about
it
was
that
the
alcohol
was
almost
nondetectible
so
you
had
a
chance
to
taste
everything
else
all
in
all
though
its
not
too
bad
in
general
three
floyds
has
gotten
the
edge
back
they
are
brewing
their
own
beer
now
and
the
beers
are
back
to
previous
standards
this
is
a
fine
example
of
the
scottish
ale
this
ale
is
wonderful
for
its
mild
flavor
which
masks
a
strong
alcohol
content
and
allows
one
to
relax
over
the
beer
knowing
that
the
alcohol
will
come
in
due
time
overall
a
beautiful
smooth
beer
which
packs
a
notable
punch
but
which
i
appreciate
when
available
in
bars
and
always
at
home
this
beer
is
exceptionally
well
colored
in
the
body
the
look
is
of
a
dark
amber
that
has
red
hues
making
something
between
copper
and
mahogany
almost
precisely
the
color
of
a
buckeye
nut
when
fully
mature
this
clear
body
is
topped
by
a
thin
tan
head
that
leaves
nice
lace
down
the
glass
although
this
lace
is
quite
light
the
nose
is
of
rich
caramel
malt
and
also
a
bit
light
plenty
of
flavor
as
the
strong
malt
base
impresses
itself
immediately
and
lends
a
sense
of
alcohol
warmth
as
well
a
decent
feel
from
the
moderate
body
but
too
rich
for
great
drinkability
this
beer
pours
a
very
impressive
apperance
other
than
that
it
is
seriously
lacking
it
has
a
bite
that
is
quite
raw
and
it
is
void
of
any
interesting
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
remincent
of
brackish
dishwater
and
i
would
take
a
bud
lite
over
this
any
day
hotstuff
and
i
went
on
a
tour
of
their
brewery
for
5
you
get
a
12oz
glass
of
3
of
their
beers
i
thought
this
beer
had
a
wonderful
aroma
full
of
hoppy
smells
the
head
disappears
very
fast
but
was
mixed
with
large
and
small
bubbles
it
had
a
heavy
taste
with
just
a
little
after
bite
the
color
was
very
dark
brown
and
you
could
not
see
through
it
the
beer
was
the
best
of
their
beers
that
we
sampled
hotstuff
gave
it
a
4
5
rating
very
drinkable
rich
beer
the
taste
is
mellow
but
still
has
a
lot
of
character
hints
of
coffee
and
caramel
many
sottish
ales
are
too
strong
for
easy
drinking
but
robert
the
bruce
is
easy
going
but
still
has
all
the
body
and
character
you
expect
in
this
style
smooth
and
rich
rich
clear
copper
color
with
some
active
carbonation
but
a
minimal
head
scents
of
caramel
and
sweet
malts
dominate
the
pleasant
nose
like
the
smell
the
taste
of
this
beer
is
pleasant
but
like
the
smell
the
taste
is
also
rather
weak
mouthfeel
is
pleasant
enough
but
the
overall
feel
and
flavor
is
too
watery
sweet
malt
greets
the
tongue
at
the
onset
and
gives
way
to
a
distinctively
warm
finish
there
are
better
scotch
ales
to
be
had
but
this
is
worth
a
try
particularly
if
you
consider
the
mcewans
of
the
world
to
be
too
syrupy
sweet
an
axe
wielding
scottsman
with
a
broad
grin
stares
at
you
from
the
label
this
beer
pours
a
clear
brown
red
when
held
up
toward
light
with
a
small
head
which
vanishes
to
all
but
a
trace
very
quickly
the
aroma
of
roasted
malt
comes
through
both
during
the
pour
and
when
lifting
the
glass
for
a
smell
the
taste
is
very
good
it
is
mild
with
smooth
malt
and
a
bit
of
hops
it
has
an
overall
very
enjoyable
taste
very
smooth
in
the
mouth
with
a
medium
to
full
body
a
highly
drinkable
beer
it
is
not
overpowering
in
any
aspect

light
bodied
than
i
expected
but
that
didnt
detract
from
the
mouthfeel
high
abv

is
barely
noticed
another
winning
beer
for
me
tip
of
the
hat
to
mjr
for
including
this
one
loaded
with
malt
this
brew
also
has
a
nice
roasty
characteristic
as
it
dries
out
fullbodied
and
very
smooth
all
the
way
through
this
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
just
a
wonderful
brew
it
is
my
first
one
from
3
floyds
and
it
really
has
me
looking
forward
to
more
its
a
bright
indian
red
color
the
head
is
large
and
fluffy
for
about
a
minute
and
then
recedes
to
a
nice
lace
caramel
and
toffee
are
in
the
aroma
pleasing
a
medium
bodied
brew
the
flavors
are
mostly
caramel
maltiness
and
then
some
hops
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
definitely
a
little
thin
but
not
watery
its
a
malt
dominated
brew
but
stays
mellow
overall
i
too
do
not
believe
the
9
1
abv
listing
there
is
no
hint
of
such
i
enjoyed
this
beer
very
much
five
more
are
in
the
fridge
and
they
will
be
consumed
happily
found
this
at
my
local
in
ohio
havent
seen
any
12
ounce
offerings
in
ohio
yet
since
three
floyds
came
back
i
notice
the
beer
label
has
the
same
robert
the
bruce
with
some
shiny
new
reflective
gleam
compared
to
the
old
labels
nice
to
see
it
this
fresh
bottled
on
22514
maybe
this
will
be
a
sign
more
fresh
12
ounce
bottles
coming
our
way
pours
a
dark
mahogany
brown
hue
with
ruby
highlights
light
cream
colored
tan
head
with
fine
speckled
lacing
aroma
has
hints
of
dark
roasted
malts
nutty
cereal
notes
full
on
malt
assault
maybe
a
layer
of
herbal
hops
for
a
bit
of
balance
the
label
states
it
best
this
ale
will
bring
a
smile
to
any
malt
lovers
lips
because
truth
be
told
i
know
this
is
one
of
the
best
examples
of
the
style
ive
ever
had
yet
a
neat
interpretation
the
purist
might
not
go
for
this
one
yet
i
find
it
tasty
and
smooth

with
a
touch
of
malt
a
caramel
the
taste
is
sweet
and
very
malty
caramel
and
smoked
peat
dominate
the
flavor
tastes
like
an
american
hopped
doublebock
if
there
is
such
a
thing
good
fruit
faint
and
some
hops
faint
and
alcohol
the
taste
was
surprisingly
decent
tastes
of
roasted
malt
probably
due
to
the
complete
absence
of
hops
which
results
in
a
flavor
that
i
am
not
so
used
to
i
am
sure
that
is
indicative
of
the
style

was

find
this
brew
quite
flavorful
d
considering
the
intense
bourbon
flavor
it
was
surprisingly
easy
to
put
down
the
12oz
glass
that
being
said
i
wasnt
overly
interested
in
having
another
glass
one
of
3
floyds
less
compelling
barrelaged
experiments
this
was
the
second
beer
i
had
on
my
first
visit
to
fff
it
was
served
in
a
snifter
which
is
perfect
for
a
brew
this
aromatic
visually
the
beer
is
very
dark
and
a
touch
cloudy
the
flavor
profile
is
very
complex
and
quite
simply
amazing
the
bourbon
flavor
is
first
followed
by
vanillamalt
and
finishes
with
subtle
raspberry
you
can
taste
the
alcohol
but
is
in
no
way
overpowering
this
is
one
that
should
be
bottled
but
since
it
is
not
i
cant
wait
to
get
munster
to
have
this
one
again
o
good
ba
brown
ale
lighter
for
a
barrel
aged
beers
but
the
raspberry
is
a
nice
twist
the
color
of
this
reminds
me
of
muddy
water
but
the
brown
is
just
a
little
lighter
where
the
appearance
was
lacking
the
smell
was
very
good
bourbon
with
a
hint
of
raspberry
and
some
caramel
malt
the
bourbon
is
up
front
on
the
taste
a
nice
subtle
oakiness
and
a
pick
up
a
little
vanilla
the
raspberry
goes
very
well
with
the
oakiness
from
the
barrel
aging
there
is
also
a
nice
sweetness
from
the
malt
the
mouth
feel
is
good
but
it
could
have
used
a
little
bit
more
carbonation
but
the
malt
really
comes
through
to
help
the
mouthfeel
overall
a
really
good
beer
i
am
normally
not
a
fan
of
beers
with
fruit
in
it
because
the
fruit
is
the
predominate
flavor
but
with
this
beer
the
bourbon
is
up
front
and
the
raspberry
come
in
very
subtlety
overall
one
of
the
highlights
of
the
party
for
me
i
had
3
glasses
of
this
i
wish
i
could
get
ahold
of
more
of
this
as
it
was
awesome
some
more
vanilla
light
red
fruit
initially
it
is
medium
bodied
offering
some
sweet
sticky
caramel
toffee
and
cocoa
raspberry
flavor
is
very
intense
finish
is
raspberries
hanging
on
with
oak
vanilla
and
caramel
i
enjoyed
this
fairly
complex
a
bit
thinned
out
overall
but
tasty
overall
i
didnt
enjoy
this
at
all
ill
have
to
rate
this
one
pretty
low
as
i
didnt
consider
it
very
drinkable
was
only
able
to
take
about
2
or
3
sips
of
it
to
do
the
tasting
and
then
just
threw
it
out
i
see
other
people
seem
to
have
liked
it
but
it
just
wasnt
my
thing
i
guess
not
a
fan
of
the
intense
raspberry
profile
tastes
more
traditionally
fruity
but
again
its
just
fruit
and
wood
rtb
is
too
passive
of
a
pallet
it
doesnt
do
anything
to
assert
its
beeriness
against
the
stronger
flavors
still
the
stronger
flavors
are
each
pleasant
and
they
balance
one
another
pretty
well
o
i
was
pretty
disappointed
with
this
beer
the
medicinal
qualities
and
the
sweetness
really
hurt
the
drinkability
and
this
is
just
a
beer
that
didnt
seem
to
handle
the
barrel
aging
process
too
well
worth
a
try
but
not
something
i
really
would
get
again
o
i
dig
the
base
beer
and
i
dig
raspberries
so
this
one
was
enjoyable
the
booze
doesnt
overpower
the
rest
of
the
beer
like
i
find
with
many
of
their
other
offerings
i
would
have
again
no
doubt
give
this
one
a
try
o
i
wasnt
convinced
going
in
that
robert
the
bruce
would
work
as
a
base
for
a
barrelaged
beer
but
the
raspberries
drew
me
in
i
found
ba
bobby
with
razzto
be
too
much
of
a
onenote
beer
and
the
note
wasnt
particularly
well
executed
mediocre
randall
overall
by
a
wide
margin
this
is
the
best
lowabv
barrelaged
treatment
from
fff
the
bourbon
booziness
is
well
in
proportion
to
the
relatively
lower
abv
of
rtb
and
the
raspberries
work
incredibly
well
good
call
whoever
had
the
idea
the
base
beer
doesnt
ring
out
as
well
as
i
woud
ideally
like
but
id
still
put
this
above
regular
rtb
and
i
would
consider
that
an
accomplishment
first
experience
with
a
scottish
ale
when
poured
there
was
maybe
a
fingers
worth
of
head
the
body
giving
off
a
dark
caramel
color
quite
pretty
to
look
at
the
smell
hinted
at
delicious
malts
caramel
and
a
bit
of
alcohol
the
taste
is
very
mellow
malt
with
an
ever
so
slight
bitterness
almost
bourbon
taste
at
the
back
of
the
tongue
alcohol
is
hidden
very
well
i
had
no
idea
its
abv
was
so
high
until
i
jumped
on
here
delicious
all
around
due
to
high
abv
drinkability
is
reduced
drinkability
excellent
not
too
sweet
too
bitter
or
too
bourbony
the
raspberry
touch
at
the
end
makes
you
want
to
take
another
sip
an
oddoff
twang
came
through
in
this
beer
we
opened
and
not
in
a
good
way
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
but
this
one
might
as
well
not
be
barrelaged
the
barrel
presence
isnt
very
prominent
and
i
dont
think
it
added
much
to
the
beer
at
all
slightly
above
average
for
the
style

o
overall
this
was
an
epic
disappointment
regular
drafty
kilt
was
my
favourite
non
ba
scotch
ale
and
to
try
this
is
like
a
kick
in
the
gut
so
unfortunate
something
went
wrong
here
overall
really
solid
bba
scotch
ale
feel
medium
body
and
carbonation
overall
like
its
non
ba
version
quite
drinkable
alcohol
well
hidden
ba
has
improved
this
one
im
probably
ruined
by
backwoods
o
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
flavors
all
over
the
map
with
nice
balance
and
complexity
im
a
ga
boy
who
had
never
even
heard
of
this
brewery
until
my
beer
guy
gave
rave
reviews
i
will
definitely
be
buying
if
i
ever
see
it
again
far
and
away
the
best
ive
had
from
monday
night
the
base
drafty
kilt
is
probably
my
favorite
they
brew
and
the
barrel
treatment
really
kicks
it
up
a
notch
nice
depth
of
flavor
make
it
worth
checking
out
glad
i
picked
up
a
few
o
this
is
about
as
balanced
a
bourbon
forward
beer
can
get
very
easy
to
drink
balanced
sweetness
but
quite
a
bit
of
bourbon
flavor
and
aroma
the
bomber
was
gone
in
about
20
minutes
i
really
enjoy
this
actually
if
you
check
history
a
lot
of
scotchirish
did
settle
in
the
southeastern
u
s
so
why
cant
scotch
ale
and
bourbon
be
friends
it
poured
a
little
thicker
then
its
base
very
little
head
a
little
stayed
around
the
edge
of
the
glass
the
smell
had
vanilla
toffee
and
small
amount
of
fruit
in
it
definitely
alot
of
bourbon
coming
out
in
this
one
the
taste
matched
the
smell
very
nice
bourbon
notes
when
taking
the
tour
i
saw
the
barrels
they
used
are
from
heaven
hill
the
fruits
definitely
came
thru
in
the
middle
and
then
ended
very
smoothly
the
mouthfeel
was
low
to
medium
carbonation
it
held
had
great
consistency
and
was
not
thin
at
all
overall
this
is
a
great
ba
brew
go
pick
some
up
it
is
one
of
the
best
ba
i
have
had
in
ga
taster
with
lunch
at
the
six
pence
pub
in
savannah
great
smokey
maltiness
my
new
fav
scotch
ale
the
flavor
profile
is
intense
complex
well
balanced
and
is
borderline
outstanding
it
begins
with
a
sweet
burst
of
molasses
and
dark
fruit
that
quickly
yields
to
a
roast
bitterness
under
the
bitterness
caramel
notes
emerge
in
the
middle
subtle
smoke
characteristics
emerge
right
before
the
finish
gain
in
intensity
and
come
to
the
forefront
as
the
finish
fades
over
a
subsiding
caramel
and
molasses
sweetness
in
the
lingering
finish
prune
notes
are
evident
as
well
as
a
slight
alcohol
burn
subtle
dryness
and
bitter
pucker
darker
than
it
tastes
extremely
pleasant
malt
spice
finish
light
on
the
smokey
barely
any

high
carbonation
good
start
for
the

beer
but
will
follow
it
up
with
a
change
pours
a
clear
very
dark
brown
with
a
ruby
tint
when
held
to

will

coming
back
for
this
one
would
be
perfect
with
chocolate
desserts
or
in
the
cold
of
winter
this
is
a
pretty
good
easy
drinking
beer
id
never
have
guessed
this
was
7

id
better
watch
myself
overall
a
decent
scottish
ale
but
i
would
agree
with
the
raters
that
say
there
are
better
definitely
an
up
and
coming
brewery
although
i
think
they
market
better
than
they
brew
on
draft
at
brick
and
tin
in
birmingham
the
aroma
is
the
best
part
fruity
and
malty
another
high
quality
ga
brew
my
first
beer
from
monday
night
its
pretty
typical
for
the
style
overall
a
good
beer
but
also
nothing
great
about
it
poured
out
of
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
good
light
brown
head
on
it
that
remained
over
the
whole
top
until
about
halfway
through
seemed
a
bit
overcarbonated
but
other
than
that
a
pretty
solid
beer
looking
forward
to
more
from
monday
night
o
easy
drinking
brew
enjoyable
but
nothing
stands
out
with
it
bourbon
barrel
age
this
one
and
you
might
have
something
special
overall
i
know
a
scotch
ale
should
be
sweet
but
this
was
just
rather
unbalanced
and
not
all
the
great
of
a
scotch
ale
the
flavors
dont
really
meld
well
on
this
one
and
with
the
rather
poor
mouthfeel
and
look
it
really
doesnt
have
much
draw
overall
not
bad
nice
brown
malts
toasty
nutty
lots
of
caramel
and
toffee
nice
mild
bitterness
and
mild
booze
late
i
almost
wanted
more
booze
warmth
nice
carb
nice
fig
paste
flavor
nice
profile
without
getting
too
sweet
or
syrupy
pretty
well
done
i
think
overall
the
best
thing
about
this
beer
is
well
its
a
tossup
between
the
aroma
and
flavoring
that
said
this
is
as
a
whole
arguably
a
tough
sell
for
the
style
as
the
butteriness
and
smokiness
are
rather
subtle
and
subdued
by
the
end
of
the
glass
the
smoke
actually
enhances
and
billows
with
warmth
matching
the
thickness
of
the
beer
it
does
hit
all
of
the
desired
and
required
notes
you
would
expect
at
least
once
but
is
generally
just
a
bit
weak
this
is
a
tasty
local
swing
at
an
admittedly
challenging
style
and
while
they
dont
execute
perfectly
it
should
satisfy
for
someone
looking
for
something
on
the
sweeter
maltier
side
of
the
craft
beer
spectrum
o
a
really
great
surprise
a
malty
delight
with
a
light
touch
of
smoke
to
provide
a
little
uniqueness
a
really
fine
beer
from
monday
night
o
overall
this
is
a
very
fine
representation
of
the
style
glad
to
try
this
one
pours
a
clear
dark
orange
with
a
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
slowly
drip
into
the
remaining
beer
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
caramel
toffee
slight
smoke
and
alcohol
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
caramel
and
fruit
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
medium
amount
of
toast
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
sticky
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
is
tasty
but
has
a
better
smoke
presence
in
the
aroma
overall
very
smooth
alcohol
is
imperceptible
nice
job
o
this
one
gets
your
attention
with
a
great
malt
and
smoke
tango
a
great
sipper
with
chocolate
chip
cookies
or
swiss
cheese
probably
great
with
barbecue
too
if
youre
a
malt
fan
drink
up
a
great
surprise
from
this
georgia
brewery
overall
eh
not
impressed
just
not
a
lot
going
on
edit
after
looking
at
other
reviewers
im
wondering
if
mine
is
a
little
off
im
finding
zero
smoke
in
the
nose
or
the
taste
perhaps
pounding
too
much
scotch
has
made
me
accustomed
to
it
or
this
was
just
from
an
off
bottle
either
way
i
might
try
it
again
sometime
as
i
just
had
a
single
this
go
around
i
know
this
review
is
kind
of
weak
from
a
technical
standpoint
but
i
will
update
this
after
my
next
trip
to
georgia
and
shortys
pizza
better
than
blind
pirate
but
after
the
promise
of
the
aroma
the
taste
was
a
step
down
bottle
the
aroma
this
is
a
winner
still
a
pretty
good
beer

really
an

the

when
they
were
contracting
great
balance
excellent
smell
the
best
i
have
tried
from
them
reminds
me
a
bit
of
gaelic
ale
from
highland
brewing
company
overall
3
5
a
very
good
scottish
ale
the
smokiness
and
malt
flavors
and
bouquets
are
wellbalanced
and
make
for
a
refreshing
and
satisfying
session
beer
however
the
low
co2
detracted
from
the
overall
experience
i
would
like
to
try
this
one
again
but
maybe
after
it
sat
in
the
kegger
for
a
few
extra
days
i
will
have
to
try
it
again
probably
at
a
warmer
temp
to
bring
out
more
complexity
had
this
one
during
my
buddys
bachelor
party
tick
all
day
every
day
served
from
tap
into
a
samuel
adams
sampler
shaker
poured
a
deep
red
brown
with
a
one
finger
offwhite
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
slowly
maintained
excellent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
dark
chocolate
caramel
caramel
hop
and
bread
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
milk
chocolate
wood
subtle
smoke
nutty
and
fruit
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
medium
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
decent
brew
if
i
am
honest
everything
for
this
brews
style
was
pretty
close
to
being
spot
on
it
could
have
done
quite
nicely
with
a
bit
more
complexity
to
carry
it
into
a
new
realm
but
it
was
fairly
enjoyable
for
the
most
part
with
what
it
had
going
on
not
the
best
thing
i
had
on
the
day
of
ticking
but
definitely
not
the
worst
i
would
try
it
again
in
the
future
mouthfeel
medium
full
body
terrific
beer
better
than
most
from
scotland
recommended
o
a
very
drinkable
and
rather
dry
scotch
ale
americanized
with
a
healthy
but
wellproportioned
dose
of
hops
unique
perhaps
due
to
the
cherrywoodsmoked
malt
o
not
a
bad
showing
but
nothing
to
getting
overly
excited
about
o
really
nice
beer
and
a
great
sipper
o
a
quality
brew
the
profile
is
pleasant
and
highly
sessionable
its
a
shame
that
so
many
people
start
their
beer
drinking
lives
with
the
cheapest
of
the
cheap
beers
like
keystone
or
pbr
which
is
having
an
odd
renaissance
with
people
whose
taste
buds
have
long
since
died
along
with
their
hearing
they
could
have
had
a
great
beer
like
this
one
overall
a
quality
scotch
ale
its
got
an
inviting
richness
to
it
without
being
bloated
and
enough
soothing
alcohol
without
being
boozy
or
putting
me
in
a
coma

the
evening

its
fair
to
say
i
enjoyed

there
was

with
more

carrying
it
across
the

a
very
rough
abrasive
beer
i
hate
to
say
that
but
thats
what
im
getting
thus
far
it
goes
from
smooth
roasty
to
acrid
acidic
with
a
linger
wet
cardboard
off
putting
note
that
i
cant
erase
from
my
memory
overall
the
harsh
mouthfeel
weak
carbonation
isnt
expressive
of
the
whole
picture
theres
a
good
beer
somewhere
here
preserve
what
you
have
and
get
through
the
rough
patches
of
starting
a
brewery
in
2010
not
the
best
beer
yet
but
theres
potential
in
the
glass
o
im
usually
not
big
on
scottish
style
ales
but
this
one
has
me
rethinking
those
feelings
its
a
solid
brew
more
balanced
than
im
used
to
finding
in
this
style
its
not
at
the
very
top
of
my
list
but
really
quite
a
nice
combination
of
flavors
and
very
drinkable
overall
this
is
a
good
brew
different
they
did
a
good
job
of
picking
various
flavors
to
bring
out
a
unique
beverage
which
is
becoming
so
difficult
to
do
among
the
many
many
competitors
recommended
im
not
sure
i
guess
it
depends
it
would
be
a
great
i
want
to
go
out
on
a
limb
and
try
something
different
and
im
in
a
store
with
this
right
in
front
of
me
brew
i
dont
think
id
go
looking
for
it
and
i
dont
think
it
would
be
the
endall
im
looking
for
a
great
scotch
ale
this
may
be
it
choice
really
enjoyable
beer
oeasily
the
best
cutters
beer
ive
had
so
far
a
nicely
put
together
scotch
ale
i
am
very
impressed
with
this
beer
my
first
foray
into
scottish
ales
it
is
very
different
from
my
recent
experiences
mainly
with
ipas
far
sweeter
and
less
citrus
tasting
i
look
forward
to
having
this
beer
again
and
will
definitely
be
exploring
this
style
further
highly
recommended
stuff
from
this
upcoming
brewery
its
really
comparable
to
founders
dirty
bastard
very
nice

not
aware
of
the
alcohol

until
after
tasting

wow
this
is
my
first
cutters
brewing
brew
and
i
was
very
impressed
my
wife
even
liked
it
which
is
saying
a
lot
for
a
beer
not
named
miller
or
coors
pours
a
wonderful
deep
copper
with
great
head
and
wonderful

throughout

and
hugely

well
with

down

well
for

of

abv
the
guy
at
big
red
called
this
one
quite
well
pours
a
cloudy
amber
with
little
head
what
head
is
there
is
an
eggshell
or
ecru
aroma
of
popcorn
is
here
with
a
sugary
sweetness
the
nice
hop
bitterness
balances
the
sweetness
appropriately
tasty
but
not
worthy
going
out
of
the
way
for
overall
a
good
beer
but
if
looking
for
a
good
example
of
the
style
there
are
better
options
a
wonderful
take
on
the
style
this
one
holds
its
own
another
tasty
brew
from
the
guys
down
at
cutters
o
fine
for
a
while
but
the
malty
flavor
starts
to
overpower
not
much
else
going
on
here
on

at
the
great

a

said
this
is
how
it

came

by
patrons
and
that
is
only
something
i
would
if
really
pressed
and
even
then
i
cannot
finish
a
glass
mouthfeel
is
blah
o
this
is
good
for
the
style
and
pretty
good
to
me
aroma
and
flavors
center
on
the
malt
its
sweet
and
bold
some
peat
or
smoke
just
in
the
background
earthy
some
fresh
nut
and
caramel
a
hint
of
fruit
apple
comes
in
the
middle
a
bit
slick
or
flat
it
seems
a
solid
offering
i
have
had
this
beer
on
tap
in
various
restaurants
throughout
midcoast
maine
and
have
also
purchased
growlers
of
this
ale
it
is
a
darker
ale
and
bold
but
has
a
sweet
flavor
almost
a
caramel
taste
malty
and
very
good
with
no
bad
aftertaste
not
very
widely
distributed
unfortunately
wishing
it
was
available
in
central
ny
and
not
just
in
maine
a
nice
almost
sessionable
smallbatch
ale
a
dark
brown
copper
colored
brew
with
little
sign
of
a
head
and
no
lacing
as
poured
chilled
at
the
great
lost
bear
in
porland
me
the
aroma
is
a
fairly
weak
maple
malt
with
maybe
a
hint
of
evergreen
the
flavor
offers
a
watery
coffeeiced
tea
malt
with
a
prevailing
tart
apple
bite
its
also
a
little
woodsy
revealing
a
bit
of
its
scottish
intentions
but
this
is
pretty
thin
bodied
and
aqueous
if
you
want
a
satisfying
result
for
me
modestly
carbonated
at
best
more
like
a
cask
ale
and
just
not
enough
guts
to
make
a
good
grade
it
does
carry
a
decent
grassyevergreen
type
bite
its
not
that
far
off
but
its
not
there
fair
drinkability
if
you
like
the
tart
flavor
enough
but
not
something
i
will
repeat
most
likely
the
drink
on
this
beer
is
very
good
considering
the
amount
of
flavor
it
is
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
and
doesnt
fill
you
to
quickly

theres

taste
follows
nose
with
the
addition
of
a
nutmeg
or
allspice
however
its
all
a
bit
watered
down
and
there
is
a
slightly
metallic
tinge

the
flavor
profile
mouthfeel

lightmedium
but
closer
to
light
with
a
pleasant
even
carbonation
and
a
fairly
clean
finish
not
a
bad
representation
of
the
style
but
the
metallic
flavor
kills
it
for
me
d
an
ok
ale
but
nothing
really
jumped
out
at
me
in
the
smell
or
taste
wouldnt
buy
again
had
this
on
tap
at
the
lobster
pound
in
lincolnville
poured
a
beautiful
brown
color
with
offwhite
head
clean
aromas
of
crisp
malt
and
bread
on
nose
with
a
super
creamy
malted
caramel
flavor
highly
drinkable
for
a
scotch
ale
i
wish
i
could
get
my
hands
on
this
at
home
definitely
recommend
taste
is
really
similar
to
the
nose
quite
malty
an
sweet
theres
a
bit
of
a
spiciness
like
nightmeg
or
something
the
finish
is
a
bit
yeasty
but
nice
refreshing
out
at
the
ocean
thanks
mikeale
for
the
opportunity
edit
the
growler
version
is
quite
different
from
the
contractbrewed
version
you
find
in
bombers
and
ontap
different
yeast
and
different
water
i
think
even
an
inexperienced
beer
drinker
could
tell
them
apart
very
nice
coppery
color
with
a
great
off
tan
colored
head
that
has
some
great
lacing
hanging
around
somewhat
solvent
like
and
rubbery
aroma
definate
malty
flavor
upfront
nice
trace
of
caramel
like
and
toffeeish
sweetness
again
like
the
aroma
it
is
somewhat
rubbery
and
that
tends
to
detract
from
what
would
be
an
otherwise
pleasant
experience
somewhat
breadybiscuit
like
nice
soft
mouthfeel
to
it
a
nice
scottish
ale
i
had
not
realized
this
was
on
my
wants
i
tend
to
think
this
might
just
be
a
somewhat
off
bottlethe
positives
tend
to
come
thru
in
the
long
run
an
interesting
experiment
from
sheepscot
theyve
done
cask
beer
before
so
its
not
inexperience
but
id
be
interested
in
trying
pemaquid
on
cask
again
to
see
how
it
turns
out
once
more
brewed
by
sebago
this
is
definitely
a
diamond
in
the
rough
my
only
personal
issue
is
with
the
carbonation
and
fruity
yeastsourness
thats
not
to
say
that
either
element
is
out
of
place
but
could
definitely
be
toned
down
a
tad
on
both
counts
ive
had
pemaquid
ontap
at
a
number
of
establishments
in
maine
and
its
definitely
better
than
from
the
bottle
also
for
better
or
worse
sebago
is
actually
the
company
that
brews
these
bombers
of
pemaquid
im
told
that
all
of
sheepscots
beers
are
best
experienced
from
the
original
source
in
a
growler
directly
from
the
barnbrewery
in
whitefield
i
e
not
sebago
d
tasty
enough
not
a
terrific
version
of
the
style
but
a
serviceable
one
wouldnt
mind
having
this
again
though
id
say
my
chances
are
pretty
slim
of
finding
more
barring
a
trip
to
maine
a
decent
example
of
the
style
very
drinkable
but
perhaps
better
suited
for
a
cold
winter
night
reviewed
on
06042009
bottle
at
pprbsg09
the
beer
pours
a
clear
brown
with
a
small
head
it
has
an
aroma
of
super
sweet
caramel
malt
and
some
roasted
notes
the
flavor
is
of
roasted
malt
mostly
overall
i
found
this
beer
to
be
sweet
and
bland
but
not
too
bad
fairly
drinkable
beer
pretty
simple
but
good
this
is
my
goto
local
beer
whenever
im
wavering
on
what
to
drink
a
growler
of
pemaquid
always
satisfies
this
time
around
i
had
it
on
tap
at
the
great
lost
bear
it
pours
very
dark
red
with
a
full
head
of
tiny
bubbles
the
head
will
disappear
so
that
it
is
virtually
nonexistent
despite
that
this
is
a
great
beer
the
taste
is
outstanding
neither
too
hoppy
or
too
malty
but
a
perfect
combination
of
flavor
very
refreshing
i
could
drink
this
one
all
day
scotch
ale
well
im
not
sure
about
that
but
all
i
know
is
that
it
is
as
enjoyable
right
now
while
snow
is
falling
on
nj
as
it
is
in
september
with
a
big
lobster
cooling
in
front
of
me
in
the
dock
bar
at
shaws
the
abv
is
a
bit
of
a
mystery
but
im
pegging
it
at
low
to
mid
5s
decent
d
i
would
be
more
than
happy
to
drink
these
all
day
i
have
had
varying
experiences
with
the
bottled
version
of
this
brew
some
are
as
amazing
as
one
can
get
in
a
growler
which
is
a
strightup
a
beer
in
my
opinion
still
none
too
shabby
out
of
a
bomber
this
beer
was
a
garnet
redbrown
color
with
a
onefinger
head
of
dijonmustard
colored
foam
mediocre
retention
and
decent
lacing
the
aroma
was
a
pleasant
blend
of
pale
malt
caramel
malt
and
floral
hops
with
hints
of
pineapple
the
flavors
were
malty
slightly
sour
and
mildly
astringent
in
an
herbal
way
with
a
roasted
character
in
the
middle
and
a
long
nutty
finish
dont
know
where
the
hops
went
here
the
mouthfeel
was
average
the
body
a
little
watery
and
the
carbonation
a
little
too
soft
had
this
beer
on
tap
at
henry
martys
in
brunswick
beer
was
a
dark
brown
color
no
head
and
lots
of
carbonation
not
a
great
deal
of
nose
here
taste
was
sweet
and
malty
quite
chompy
mouthfeel
was
thick
and
satisfying
overall
a
great
beer
definitely
a
good
sipper
overall
it
was
not
bad
rather
ehh
but
still
better
then
a
lot
of
the
style
i
would
not
really
have
a
problem
with
trying
this
one
again
if
it
was
sent
to
me
definitely
an
interesting
take
on
the
style
dark
reddish
amber
almost
brown
color
12
inch
creamy
head
smell
is
malty
sweet
with
wonderful
fresh
wort
aromas
lots
of
malt
upfront
in
taste
and
dominates
until
the
middle
when
the
hops
kick
in
malt
and
hops
continue
to
charge
through
together
to
the
bittersweet
finish
very
quaffable
flavor
profile
that
includes
subtleties
in
the
aroma
bouquet
aromas
and
flavors
include
burnt
sugar
cookies
and
sweet
dried
fruits
with
a
hop
spice
and
light
smoke
to
add
a
little
balance
semicreamy
mouthfeel
could
drink
this
all
night
had
this
on
tap
at
the
great
lost
bear
in
portland
and
i
have
to
say
i
didnt
finish
it
poured
an
orange
chestnut
with
a
fine
tight
head
unfortunately
it
went
downhill
from
there
the
smell
was
a
weird
combo
of
sweet
malt
and
a
light
sourness
the
two
did
not
marry
well
i
dont
know
if
the
sourness
was
intentional
or
not
but
as
it
was
being
served
at
a
fairly
well
respected
institution
i
took
it
for
what
it
was
the
taste
was
sour
as
well
seemed
infected
light
and
watery
i
hesitate
to
review
such
beers
in
the
bottle
but
on
tap
i
think
the
brewery
is
often
at
fault
particularly
if
it
is
being
served
at
a
reasonable
place
in
such
cases
ill
review
them
mouthfeel
is
watery
and
insipid
yuck
this
was
sweet
i
did
drink
the
whole
22
but
i
certainly
couldnt
have
drank
any
more
right
away
it
was
good
but
slightly
off
balance
could
have
used
one
more
shovel
of
hops
to
dry
the
finish
a
tad
more
overall
a
decent
brew
i
wouldnt
turn
my
nose
up
at
if
it
was
sent
to
me
again
i
like
scottish
ale
and
this
is
a
pretty
good
example
highly
drinkable
did
i
mention
the
malt
i
could
drink
another
bomber
and
im
one
who
hardly
ever
drinks
more
than
a
beer
in
a
sitting
yummy
beer
that
im
glad
to
have
had
the
oppurtunity
to
sample
poured
into
my
trusty
red
oak
pint
glass
a
mixture
of
amber
and
brown
good
clarity
and
a
tight
formed
12
finger
white
head
atop
brown
sugar
and
a
touch
roasty
malt
in
the
nose
a
lingering
sharp
herbal
note
as
welllight
to
medium
mouthfeel
makes
it
glide
down
pretty
easily
the
flavors
dont
hit
hard
more
subtle
malt
notes
light
brown
sugar
and
nut
but
not
overly
sweet
a
light
but
firm
earthiness
comes
through
late
making
it
even
more
drinkable
basic
but
very
good
its
food
friendly
and
has
nice
malt
flavorsbrewed
with
american
and
belgian
malts
and
hopped
withkent
goldings
pours
a
deep
amber
in
color
beneath
a
creamy
bone
white
head
traces
of
patchy
lacing
with
decent
strength
aromas
of
musty
toffee
caramel
and
earthenfloral
hops
toasted
maltiness
with
a
semisweet
toffee
and
molasses
creaminess
lingering
yeasty
mustiness
with
a
floral
hop
finish
medium
in
body
airy
and
biscuity
on
the
palate
despite
the
sweetness
easy
drinking
lightly
malted
scottish
offering
a
decent
offering
from
sheepscot
decent
enough
for
me
to
try
some
of
their
other
offerings
growler
purchased
at
florians
dark
brownishred
translucent
body
with
only
a
thin
film
of
offwhite
head
smells
roasty
and
buttery
tastes
malty
and
roasty
with
caramel
and
chocolate
notes
coming
out
after
a
few
sips
as
well
as
suggestions
of
nut
and
vanilla
diacetyl
is
also
there
but
takes
an
almost
immediate
backseat
to
the
complex
maltiness
of
the
beer
medium
bodied
with
more
carbonation
than
expected
but
not
to
the
point
of
pricklyness
im
impressed
with
the
carbonation
of
this
one
just
enough
while
i
think
this
beer
has
just
a
hint
of
oxidation
after
a
few
sips
the
beers
true
character
emerges
revealing
a
rich
complex
plethora
of
flavors
in
almost
perfect
balance
this
beer
is
really
good
id
love
to
try
it
ontap
sometime
definitely
growing
more
impressed
with
this
brewery
overall
an
interesting
ale
with
authenticity
and
local
freshness
i
could
drink
a
few
but
its
not
my
preferred
style
more
hops
and
less
sweet
than
some
boring
brown
ales
definitely
worth
a
try
when
you
see
it
offered
odd
flavor
i
get
something
sulphuric
but
not
as
if
it
was
a
spent
match
it
was
more
like
a
book
of
matches
that
got
wet
and
were
never
struck
also
a
bit
of
a
tang
are
the
flavors
off
through
it
all
there
is
a
strongly
sweet
caramel
presence
slightly
bitter
towards
the
finish
medium
body
that
is
a
hair
towards
thin
interesting
beer
but
this
may
be
more
of
a
hybrid
style
with
a
pale
ale
i
believe
this
beer
was
a
beautiful
dark
red
color
without
much
head
it
had
a
pleasant
fruity
odor
and
an
indefinable
fruity
taste
it
seemed
very
carbonated
to
me
and
had
only
average
mouthfeel
not
a
beer
that
id
want
to
sit
down
for
a
long
night
with
but
we
could
date
casually
i
may
have
to
go
over
this
beer
again
in
the
future
ive
had
this
before
and
dont
remember
the
beer
to
be
how
im
tasting
it
now
undated
growler
that
i
bought
at
the
puffin
stop
in
damariscotta
pours
a
dark
brown
very
cloudy
and
a
nice
head
that
stays
for
a
couple
of
minutes
tastes
a
somewhat
maltylicorice
flavor
not
very
strong
actually
quite
nice
for
a
scottish
ale
is
actually
a
refreshing
beer
which
makes
it
a
little
weird
for
me
i
might
have
gotten
a
old
growler
i
dont
know
because
it
doesnt
taste
old
it
just
not
what
i
expected
i
do
recommend
it
though
pours
an
offwhite
onefinger
head
that
goes
quickly
and
leaves
hardly
any
lace
clear
copperamber
color
low
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
caramel
nose
starts
with
a
burnt
caramelsmoked
hickory
flavor
hints
of
bitterness
at
finish
9
24
for
a
64oz
growler
from
treats
wiscasset
me
lots
of
big
brown
malt
here
very
flavorful
and
nutty
with
a
hint
of
diacetyl
and
toffee
medium
body
and
lightly
hopped
a
good
solid
brownscotch
ale
that
could
easily
be
drank
over
the
course
of
an
evening
tastes
of
caramel
and
sweet
malt
nutty
and
smoky
has
a
light
hoppy
finish
medium
bodied
beer
nice
drinkable
brown
ale
steve
sure
likes
his
brews
bold
and
malty
a
very
interesting
and
flavorful
brew
the
deep
brown
color
and
buttery
aroma
lead
toward
a
smooth
bodied
ale
the
buttery
malty
flavors
come
through
the
strongest
with
a
nice
light
spice
balance
373
pours
a
hazy
dark
amber
color
with
a
big
frothy
head
the
smell
is
pretty
malty
with
hints
of
fruit
and
citrus
the
taste
is
predominately
sweet
caramel
malt
with
a
fair
share
of
hops
to
make
this
quite
an
interesting
beer
overall
a
pretty
good
well
balanced
beer
unique
beer
with
the
same
superhigh
quality
known
from
odell
really
good
amber
ale
i
didnt
pour
it
since
im
a
poor
college
student
and
i
dont
have
pint
glasses
but
regardless
it
was
quite
tasty
smooth
clean
and
easy
to
drink
this
beer
is
ideal
for
nearly
any
occasion
i
highly
recommend
it
overall
more
of
an
amber
than
a
scottish
and
their
description
of
the
brew
reflects
that
i
dig
it
relatively
simple
but
full
flavored
try
it
and
like
it
smooth
smooth
smooth
smooth
smooth
i
found
it
interesting
this
is
an
interpretation
of
a
toned
down
iscotch
ale
certainly
well
balanced
as
far
as
hops
and
malts
are
concerned
a
smoky
taste
of
molasses
and
malts
get
a
pick
me
up
from
the
zestiness
and
crispiness
of
the
hops
giving
the
90
schilling
a
refreshing
mouth
feel
very
enjoyable
to
drink
i
would
imagine
it
pairs
very
well
with
many
types
of
food
as
well
as
it
fits
drinking
as
a
session
a
nice
pick
me
up
of
a
buzz
as
well
a
good
selection
to
make
especially
if
you
have
never
had
the
pleasure
would
purchase
again
if
available
this
is
a
fantastic
ale
goes
down
smooth
and
a
mn
awesome
flavor
overall
once
again
my
sensitivity
to
hop
flavors
has
me
arching
an
eyebrow
at
anyone
who
has
reviewed
this
beer
as
malty
and
mentioned
nothing
of
any
hop
presence
at
all
they
are
literally
all
i
get
out
of
this
beer
aside
from
a
brief
flash
of
caramel
malt
at
the
outset
will
not
repeat
get
some
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
styles
of
beer
and
i
really
do
enjoy
this
one
could
use
a
tad
more
punch
abv
is
around
5
kinda
light
for
this
style
plus
it
very
hard
to
get
in
my
area
one
of
my
favorite
beers
ever
a
very
good
beer
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
heavily
hopped
but
it
wasnt
nice
balance
this
is
a
good
malty
drinking
beer
something
to
session
on
or
have
with
a
meal
not
all
that
impressive
stand
alone
but
a
good
session
and
food
pairing
brew
i
do
not
write
reviews
good
tastes
similar
to
rahrs
iron
thistle
but
not
as
flavorful
still
a
good
beer
though
o
very
underwhelming
i
expected
much
more
malt
sweetness
or
malt
flavor
of
some
kind
but
its
mostly
corngrain
and
rubbing
alcohol
possibly
i
have
a
very
old
sixpack
here
but
i
also
figured
this
maltforward
style
would
age
well
i
hate
to
rip
a
beer
in
a
style
im
not
wellversed
in
but
this
tastes
like
one
of
the
many
bland
blonde
ales
craft
brewers
use
to
lure
bmc
drinkers
kind
of
an
allaround
dud
except
for
that
big
fluffy
sticky
head
odell
just
can
do
me
no
wrong
a
fun
easy
drinking
scottish
ale
that
has
fantastic
bready
character
without
getting
overly
sweet
sugary
bitter
watery
or
anything
odell
delivers
the
goods
great
beer
lots
of
depth
but
still
easy
to
drink
one
of
the
best
in
fort
collins
and
any
other
place
on
earth
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
shaker
pint
the
beer
is
a
light
amber
coloring
with
a
fluffy
clingy
bubbly
offwhite
head
nose
of
muted
roasted
caramel
and
nut
with
earthy
highlights
flavors
are
roasted
caramel
sweet
with
earthy
tones
and
hints
of
char
smooth
slick
bodied
with
a
roasted
sugary
sweet
aftertaste
smooth
slightly
cloying
finish
overall
very
nice
pairs
really
well
with
a
good
sandwich
or
burger
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
to
a
drinker
of
massmarketed
beer
who
is
uneasy
about
trying
something
different
or
crafty
my
first
review
really
should
be
for
my
favorite
beer
shouldnt
it
this
beer
goes
with
every
food
its
perfectly
balanced
and
its
a
great
introduction
to
craft
beer
for
those
who
have
never
seen
the
light
its
closer
in
style
to
an
amber
ale
which
might
bore
some
people
but
dont
let
a
classification
determine
what
you
try
beautiful
color
not
too
high
alcohol
content
not
super
hoppy
not
too
sweet
just
a
fantastic
beer
will
have
one
of
these
anytime
anywhere
ap
35
ar
325
sab
375
sens
375
c

kind
of
nutty
with
nice
after
taste
that
makes
you
want
more
plus
it
goes
down
easily
overall

i
had
a
hard
time
with
this
one
i
truly
wanted
to
give
it
a
raving
review
but
something
was
just
missing
for
me
so
yes
90
shilling
is
an
impressive
little
beer
that
would
be
great
with
a
friend
and
great
for
a
trial
run
like
what
im
doing
here
people
go
crazy
over
it
but
i
think
its
simply
a
capable
beer
after
half
the
bottle
im
about
spent
with
this
one
i
dont
know
if
i
would
actually
go
out
and
purchase
it
again
but
it
is
a
good
fullflavored
beer
and
crafty
too
if
youre
looking
for
something
to
wet
your
whistle
look
elsewhere
but
if
youre
looking
for
a
bouquet
of
interesting
flavors
that
make
you
raise
your
eyebrow
and
say
hmmm
or
mmmm

in

and
i
will
continue
to
buy
this
classic
colorado
beer
d
i
had
to
open
a
third
for
this
review
i
keep
sucking
them
down
d
a
very
drinkable
beer
a
very
good
amber
ale
md
cant
complain
about
the
feel
or
the
drinkability
i
could
drink
this
as
a
session
beer
or
take
it
to
a
party
great
all
around
beer
i
buy
this
one
often
and
for
good
reason
90
shilling
is
somewhat
surprising
when
you
smell
it
it
smells
malty
like
you
would
expect
from
the
style
when
you
drink
it
however
there
is
a
distinct
hop
character
not
aroma
character
it
has
a
copper
color
with
a
nice
tan
head
it
is
very
drinkable
and
i
really
enjoyed
the
hops
drinkability
is
very
good
my
large
mug
went
down
in
a
hurry
i
thought
it
was
stronger
as
a
90
shilling
and
is
probably
more
like
a
70
shilling
in
general
i
like
scotch
ales
stronger
and
a
little
smokey
this
one
is
still
pretty
good
all
around
for
a
lighter
scotch
ale
mouthfeel
is
mild
and
crisp
a
bit
of
tartness
and
finishes
clean
its
been
a
while
since
ive
visited
this
beer
and
im
kicking
myself
for
waiting
so
long
first
off
this
is
not
the
greatest
beer
on
earth
nor
does
it
deserve
a
5
to
each
is
own
i
suppose
poured

these
are

mouthfeel
seems
good
with
decent

although
i
am
new

scottish
ales
in

so
i
dont
have
much
of
a
standard
of
judgement
for
the
style
overall
though
i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
look
forward
to
reviewing
more
odell
offerings
brown
with
ruby
highlights
and
a
very
malty
smell
i
dont
really
know
how
to
judge
thse
scottish

since
i
havent
sampled
many
alesmith
wee
heavy
was
good
this
was
not

beer
in

pours
amber
red
with
some

but
not
a
huge
amount
on
the
taste
it
has
a
sweeter
edge
its
full
bodied
and
has
a
nice
froth
on
the
mouth
it
might
be
a
bit
heavy
for
some
people
for
a
session
beer
but
for
people
who
enjoy
quality
its
a
good
brew

nice
looking

aroma
very
well

a

enough
hops
to
add
just
a
hint
of
bitterness
i
enjoyed
this
on
draught
in
denver
and
brought
a
sixer
back
home
with
me
another
winner
from
odell
the
taste
is
a
bit
reserved
with
a
slightly
malty
spiced
hop
notes
some
cinnamon
is
detected
as
well
nothing
too
noteworthy
but
still
agreeable
mouthfeel
detects
a
medium
body
thats
a
touch
on
the
overcarbonated
side
a
decent
yet
somewhat
filmy
bitter
hop
finish
rounds
out
the
aftertaste
90
schilling
goes
down
smoothly
and
finishes
well
but
theres
just
not
enough
complexity
to
really
put
it
over
the
top
i
am
looking
forward
to
my
odells
ipa
however
drinkability
real
nice
sipping
beer
i
would
try
this
again
since
i
didnt
buy
this
i
cant
say
buy
lol
d
this
is
not
especially
complex
or
unique
but
it
has
session
written
all
over
it
im
not
sure
if
its
due
to
the
popularity
of
fat
tire
or
the
crisp
mountain
climate
but
it
seems
like
colorado
microbrewers
tend
to
focus
on
amberred
ales
as
their
flagship
beers
this
is
a
slightly
above
average
basic
tasty
ale
that
is
a
nice
brew
to
have
with
dinner
has
a
nice
soft
mouthfeel
but
like
the
beer
overall
a
little
weak
especially
for
the
style
it
is
a
very
nice
well
balanced
beer
but
not
what
i
was
expecting
easy
to
drink
yet
flavorful
beer
smells
faintly
of
sorghum
call
me
crazy
but
other
than
that
nothing
distinctive
tastes
of
yeast
and
malt
and
the
carbonation
is
evident
with
5
3
abv
it
isnt
exactly
a
knock
out
beer
but
sure
gives
you
bang
for
the
buck
above
average
mouthfeel
to
this
beer
a
decent
beer
to
order
in
a
bar
instead
of
a
bud
possesses
a
creaminess
i
wouldnt
have
expected
slightly
higher
in
alcohol
than
an
english
mild
but
doesnt
taste
sweet
enough
to
be
scottish
nevertheless
a
wonderful
uk
hybrid
if
you
will
im
glad
more
american
brewers
are
taking
stabs
at
traditional
simple
styles
instead
of
concentrating
solely
on
extreme
beer
an
excellent
session
brew
drinkability
i
like
this
beer
it
has
good
characteristics
of
most
90
schilling
types
ive
tried
in
the
past
but
lets
be
honest
there
arent
a
ton
of
them
out
there
but
id
wished
it
be
a
little
more
punchy
in
terms
of
the
alcohol
kick
the
label
is
honest
in
any
event
by
letting
us
know
that
its
a
5
3
abv
beer
although
id
probably
rate
it
higher
if
it
was
in
the
7
range
i
really
enjoyed
the
complexity
of
the
smell
and
taste
of
this
beer
and
am
glad
i
purchased
it
not
much
to
say
other
than
this
was
a
very
very
good
beer
starts
with
a
dark
brownishamber
appearance
and
a
malty
aroma
with
faint
smell
of
hops
a
nice
sweet
rich
malty
smooth
taste
with
a
hint
of
hops
in
the
finish
i
noticed
in
the
style
description
of
scotch
ales
that
the
wort
is
boiled
longer
and
more
caramelized
which
is
probably
the
explains
the
rich
and
smooth
flavors
this
is
definitely
one
of
my
favorite
brews
d
overall
im
impressed
with
this
beer
it
is
much
more
satisfying
than
i
expected
even
though
it
was
based
on
nothing
in
particular
poured
from
a
12oz
brown
bottle
into
my
nonic
pint
glass
appears
a
clear
amber
color
with
barely
half
an
inch
of
thin
offwhite
foam
the
head
fades
quickly
leaving
no
lace
smells
of
lightly
toasted
grain
along
with
a
pronounced
nuttiness
as
well
as
some
apple
and
pear
notes
tastes
of
sweet
malt
bread
roasty
grain
and
bitter
hops
medium
in
body
with
mild
to
medium
carbonation
not
a
bad
beer
but
imo
more
like
an
amber
than
a
scotch
ale
worth
a
try
though
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
medium
bodied
this
is
not
my
favorite
style
but
it
was
nice
d
this
beer
has
nice
roasted
flavor
but
it
is
very
smooth
and
drinkable
drinkability
the
alcohol
sting
and
the
dry
finish
doesnt
make
me
a
fan
of
this
beer
and
i
dont
think
i
could
down
more
than
a
couple
of
these
in
one
session
drinkability
very
nice
going
down
i
can
drink
this
one
all
day
long
more
like
an
american
amber
ale
to
me
as
the
hops
are
distinct
better
than
the
levity
possible
replacement
overall
an
okay
beer
from
odell
d
a
good
beer
not
great
easy
to
drink
and
enjoy
it
was
probably
a
touch
too
warm
so
my
next
will
be
straight
from
the
fridge
d
pours
a
mildly
hazed
dark
copper
with
a
thin
froth
on

that
clings
onto
the
glass
smells
of
toasted
malts
chocolate
light
raisin
characteristics
and
bread
taste
is
of
dried
fruit
chocolate
toast
and
herbal
hops
has
a
mild
tart
presence
to
the
flavor
carbonation
is
firm
with
a
slightly
sticky
body
solid
drinker
opinion
this
is
a
tasty
beer
that
said
i
wouldnt
expect
much
of
a
scottish
ale
by
definition
i
would
drink
this
beer
again
but
i
believe
that
it
is
a
bit
of
a
blurr
between
a
scottish
export
80
and
a
british
pale
ale
take
that
as
you
may
d
im
very
happy
i

this

drinkable
not
a
bad
brew
from
odell
thanks
for
the
bottle
wasatch
drinkability
a
nice
take
on
a
scottish
ale
pours
a
clear
reddishcopper
with
a
thin
but
dense
tan
head
smells
sweet
and
murky
somehow
if
thats
possible
it
has
a
sharply
sour
finish
to
the
smell
taste
is
much
better
though
starts
with
a
bit
of
fruit
up
front
like
sour
cherries
it
gets
dry
from
there
very
dry
slight
hops
on
the
finish
which
is
a
nice
balance
to
the
malt
the
malt
isnt
very
sweet
at
first
i
would
have
said
it
lacked
the
peat
of
a
scottish
ale
but
as
the
beer
has
warmed
i
revise
that
statement
definite
peat
and
very
delicate
a
nice
feat
and
it
makes
for
a
flavor
that
addresses
the
gripe
i
frequently
have
of
scottish
ales
that
they
just
demand
too
much
of
you
mouthfeel
is
slightly
oily
not
so
much
as
to
prevent
it
from
being
a
refreshing
drink
nice
carbonation
drinkability
hard
to
drink
a
lot
of
them
with
that
bonedry
finish
a
very
good
beer
and
an
interesting
cross
of
styles
but
not
something
that
will
move
into
my
regular
rotation
drinkability
alright
has
a
sour
malt
aftertaste
light
brown
dark
amber
in
appearance
with
a
slight
white
head
smells
of
malt
and
barley
with
a
hint
of
hops
sweet
in
taste
with
the
a
slight
bitterness
this
ale
has
a
strong
character
and
am
grateful
for
my
friend
leaving
the
12
pack
in
my
fridge
its
been
a
great
beer
for
the
cold
weather
weve
had
in
fc
in
the
past
two
weeks
a
second
taste
reveals
the
thick
yet
light
flavor
of
the
malt
a
great
beer
that
is
fulfilling
and
yet
quite
drinkable
overall
a
pleasant
surprise
id
definitely
pick
this
up
again
and
other
brews
from
this
company
m
lightly
carbonated
very
easy
to
drink
great
session
beer
all
around
very
refreshing
d
this
is
an
excellent
session
beer
as
it
warms
the
carmalization
really
starts
to
become
apparant
another
fine
beer
from
odell
d
good
drinkability
mellow
flavorful
session
style
ale
mouthfeel
seems
okay
a
bit
thin
though
low
carbonation
levels
good
session
drinkability
light
flavor
and
light
body
make
this
go
down
easily
id
like
to
see
it
kicked
up
a
notch
or
two
overall
i
like
the
depth
and
complexity
of
this
beer
the
toasted
malt
definately
adds
smoothness
and
complexity
without
giving
a
bitter
or
forced
taste
very
balanced
i
rather
enjoyed
this
beer
and
wish
i
had
more
than
one
hint
hint
solomon420
looking
forward
to
the
next
bee
from
odell
overall
a
mix
between
a
scottish
ale
and
an
amber
ale
thats
a
good
beer
i
recommend
this
beer
is
a
reddish
mahogany
color
there
is
a
thin
head
and
some
lacing
the
smell
is
very
good
bitter
and
caramel
like
the
taste
is
a
nice
sweet
start
with
a
slight
hoppy
finish
there
is
a
good
aftertaste
as
well
the
beer
is
smooth
to
drink
and
i
could
certainly
drink
this
beer
again
i
found
this
scottish
ale
in
st
louis
about
a
month
ago
and
forgot
about
it
until
now
pours
a
great
amberruby
color
with
a
nice
head
and
a
bit
of
solid
lacing
around
the
glass
a
bit
of
hoppy
characteristic
is
fantastic
on
a
warm
evening
reminds
me
of
a
darker
pale
ale
ill
drink
this
one
again
and
try
some
others
from
odell
brewing
when
i
get
the
chance
thanks
oxymoron
for
the
opportunity
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
as
a
reddishorange
with
lingering
offwhite
head
and
excellent
lacing
aroma
was
slightly
detectable
hoppiness
but
flavor
was
a
perfect
blend
of
hops
and
malts
finish
was
very
smooth
somewhat
warming
and
long
lasting
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
d
i
enjoyed
this
beer
odell
makes
good
brews
drinkability
good
but
not
much
fruitiness
and
the
beer
overall
is
a
little
light
like
most
odells
this
is
sessionable
but
nothing
wild
on
the
palate
not
a
boundary
pusher
in
terms
of
the
style
or
microbrewing
poured
a
rich
dark
copper
color
fluffy
two
inch
head
great
lacing
excellent
malt
profile
friends
had
recommended
this
several
times
many
described
it
as
being
very
smooth
i
very
much
agree
a
tremendous
session
beer
nice
carbonation
enhances
the
sweet
caramel
notes
after
investing
so
much
time
in
ipas
this
drinks
like
a
cola
that
is
easy
drinking
at
its
finest
odell
is
steadily
making
itself
one
of
my
favrite
breweries
good
show
on
tap
a
a
restaurant
in
littleton
co
it
pours
a
nice
amber
with
an
offwhite
head
that
leaves
a
bit
of
lace
the
smell
is
caramel
with
a
nice
dose
of
fresh
hops
the
taste
is
wellbalanced
with
caramel
a
hint
of
bittersweet
chocolate
and
just
enough
hop
bite
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
its
quite
drinkable
i
only
wish
i
could
find
it
on
tap
when
i
head
back
to
california
drinkability
is
relaly
top
notch
relaly
solid
beer
that
always
make
me
look
forward
to
the
trips
to
kc
where
i
can
get
this
thanks
to
my
brother
for
supplying
this

the
beginning
of
a

carbonation
though
not

glides
along
the

drinkability
well
i
could
definitely
love
this
stuff
on
cask
but
its
still
a
great
tasting
session
ale
regardless
of
serving
style
dark
copperamber
color
only
a
thin
head
with
decent
retention
good
clarity
the
smell
is
mild
some
faint
hoppiness
and
caramel
malt
flavor
present
the
taste
starts
out
moderately
hoppy
and
then
the
sweet
caramel
malt
comes
through
in
the
finish
not
very
bitter
medium
thickness
average
carbonation
not
a
bad
balance
of
flavors
here
the
malt
was
nice
but
could
have
been
more
intriguing
it
just
didnt
taste
that
fresh
to
me
its
still
a
fine
colorado
craft
brew
if
i
could
get
this
on
tap
this
would
be
a
front
runner
amongst
my
session
choices
good
in
the
bottle
but
was
almost
like
a
different
beer
on
tap
tastes
more
like
a
scotch
ale
on
draft
highly
reccomended
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
light
and
doesnt
seem
to
have
much
going
on
in
terms
of
carbonation
still
a
good
drinkable
beer
as
a
scottish
ale
it
is
fairly
weak
but
as
a
hybrid
scottish
ale
english
pale
it
is
really
quite
tasty
im
glad
i
picked
it
up
taste
has
malts
but
with
a
spiceysweet
undertone
at
first
i
thought
it
would
be
too
malty
for
me
but
it
cleared
up
and
ended
as
a
pale
great
drinkability
and
mouthfeel
a
darn
good
beer
medium
bodied
sharp
and
dry
in
my
book
the
5
3
abv
makes
this
one
a
qualifier
for
the
session
book
at
least
a
sixpack
afternoon
with
football
cheers
well
done
but
this
is
certainly
not
a
scotch
ale
dont
let
the
bottle
fool
you
try
this
is
you
like
fat
tire
although
fairly
rich
in
flavors
none
are
overbearingly
aggressive
very
smooth
and
very
drinkable
although
a
little
mild
for
this
kind
of
ale
drinkability
is
pretty
damn
good
hell
of
a
sessions
brew
here
thanks
go
to
hometown
sports
bif
and
imwithstupid
for
this
treat
although
id
like
to
see
a
little
bit
more
in
terms
of
abvflavor
from
a
90
shilling
scottish
ale
this
beer
is
quite
enjoyable
and
is
another
example
of
a
good
crossover
craft
beer
its
definitely
sessionable
and
its
sheer
maltiness
makes
a
nice
change
from
the
majority
of
american
craft
beers
never
buy
less
that
6
of
these
unless
you
are
sharing
with
friends
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
creamy
with
fast
moving
carbonation
i
wouldnt
mind
the
carb
being
tuned
down
a
little
as
it
seems
to
step
over
the
body
of
the
brew
overall
this
is
a
tasty
scottish
ale
not
one
of
my
favorite
styles
but
id
say
check
it
out
if
you
dig
the
scottish
ales
thanks
to
babydoc
for
this
one
had
a
sampler
at
the
brewery
in
fort
collins
color
is
a
dark
amber
smells
fruity
and
sweet
i
would
say
more
on
the
sweet
side
like
some
type
of
candy
taste
is
malty
with
a
nice
bitter
bite
in
the
aftertaste
also
maybe
a
little
bit
smoky
aftertaste
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
one
of
the
better
ones
i
had
at
odells
overall
a
nice
session
brew
that
went
well
by
itself
outside
in
the
summer
chill
and
alongside
some
bbq
overall
pleasantly
sweet
soft
ale
that
gives
fat
tire
a
run
for
its
money
its
clean
flavors
make
it
an
easygoing
everyday
beer
id
love
to
try
it
fresh
from
the
source
on
tap
of
course
thanks
to
crjmellor
for
this
unsolicited
gift
quite
the
gentleman
poured
a
clear
dark
amber
with
a
big
frothy
head
that
lasted
for
quite
a
while
aroma
was
pretty
much
nonexistent
at
first
but
slight
hops
and
malt
became
detectable
as
the
beer
warmed
and
the
head
disappeared
light
and
slightly
sweet
malt
flavours
with
a
slight
bitter
finish
it
was
a
pretty
smooth
and
easy
drinking
beer
and
certainly
one
that
you
can
drink
several
of
without
even
noticing
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
clean
seems
to
skirt
the
line
between
a
scottish
ale
and
a
pale
ale
i
could
session
this
i
liked
how
this
beer
looked
it
was
a
deep
deep
amber
and
kept
a
nice
head
the
nose
was
nice
but
slightly
average
i
ordered
this
beer
after
two
that
werent
so
good
one
that
i
only
got
halfway
through
before
stopping
so
i
hope
that
didnt
skew
my
review
i
like
odell
so
probably
not
the
taste
had
a
good
amount
of
alcohol
to
it
with
lots
of

definitly
order

a

not
much
flavor
to
start
and
the
ending
flavors
rise
slowly
late
i
get
chocoalte
and
tofee
with
some
raisin
very
late
i
get
a
hint
of
chalky
from
vienna
or
munich
malt
it
has
a
sourish
finish
thats
kinda
dry
not
quite
a
cherrylike
sour
also
some
acid
from
the
carbonation
rising
off
my
tastebuds
in
the
flat
of
my
tongue
light
body
this
doesnt
do
it
for
me
if
they
could
put
a
flavor
up
front
when
the
beer
first
touches
the
tongue
it
would
be
much
more
intersting
decent
lacing
on
the
glass
odell
90
shilling
ale
is
pretty
good
beer
no
matter
what
style
one
settles
on
as
noted
above
it
tastes
like
a
robust
amber
ale
right
out
of
the
chute
it
then
takes
on
some
although
not
all
of
the
characteristics
of
a
quasiscottish
ale
by
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
i
continue
to
be
impressed
by
this
brewery
pours
a
clear
rusty
copper
with
a
beigetan
head
lacing
decorates
the
glass
nose
is
malty
of
course
it
should
be
sweetish
with
light

and

nice

it
too
taste

malts
are
lightly
sweet
earthy
and

minor
hops
come
in
and
mostly
just
add
dryness
lightly
bitter
and
interesting
for
the
style

with

a
nice
beer
unique
for
the
style
beer
drinkability
went
down
smooth
i
am
not
well
experienced
in
the
style
so
i
can
not
judge
whether
or
not
this
is
true
to
the
style
but
i
definitely
enjoyed
it
its
a
simple
beer
come
on
there
is
so
much
great
beer
out
there
this
is
a
waste
of
time
its
a
decent
amber
for
frat
boys
trying
to
grow
out
of
their
coors
diapers
the
hopping
is
boorish
and
masks
what
is
good
about
the
beer
a
nice
malting
they
call
it
a
cross
between
an
english
pale
ale
and
a
scottish
ale
uh
okay
that
combination
is
dumb
naming
this
beer
90
shilling
is
dumb
its
a
drinkable
american
colorado
ale
as
they
call
it
amber
a
bad
scottish
ale
because
of
too
much
boring
american
hopping
a
bad
english
pale
ale
because
its
too
sweet
this
is
an
average
microbeer
10
years
beyond
deserving
recognition
now
its
just
a
quaint
player
in
a
market
full
of
dynamic
offerings
this
poured
out
a
brownish
bronze
with
a
bout
a
halfinch
head
of
off
white
foam
as
the
head
dies
off
rather
quickly
the
glass
was
left
decorated
with
sparse
patches
of
lace
caramel
sweetness
rose
from
the
glass
in
a
pleasant
but
fairly
mild
aroma
that
also
had
some
fruit
notes
to
it
flavor
had
a
strong
caramel
presence
with
a
bit
of
an
earthy
hop
kick
to
keep
the
sweetness
in
check
there
were
also
notes
of
fruits
and
it
was
a
bit
doughy
at
times
the
mouthfeel
was
good
but
feel
a
little
short
of
a
medium
body
this
stuff
is
pretty
darn
tasty
and
goes
down
very
easy
i
would
definitely
pick
more
up
if
it
were
available
in
the
area
thanks
to
bditty187
for
this
tasty
bonus
beer
drinkability
only
had
one
but
it
went
down
easy
murky
medium
brown
color
huge
white
head
leaves
a
lot
of
sticky
lacing
on
the
side
of
the
glass
going
down
taste
has
a
good
amount
of
carmel
malts
which
accentuate
the
strong
hop
presence
the
body
could
stand
to
be
a
little
thicker
but
overall
this
was
a
solid
beer
goo
for
a
fallback
in
times
of
bmc
only
land
id
have
this
one
again
708
this
baby
is
an
easy
drinker
very
smooth
after
a
rough
pour
and
very
malty
nothing
extreme
not
even
that
impressive
just
a
solid
drinker
unknowingly
this
was
my
first
experience
with
scottish
ales
and
i
rather
enjoyed
it
90
shilling
poured
a
nice
deep
reddishorangebrown
almost
a
cherry
wood
color
the
head
was
less
than
bountiful
but
remained
rather
well
throughout
the
smell
was
nice
a
sweet
but
slightly
roasted
malt
touched
with
a
bit
of
hops
the
taste
was
much
the
same
a
nice
balance
of
malt
that
was
both
sweet
and
toasted
with
a
bit
of
hops
to
keep
things
on
even
ground
the
mouthfeel
is
very
pleasant
with
nice
carbination
with
medium
body
and
the
light
bitterness
overall
this
was
a
very
nice
beer
that
introduced
me
to
scottish
ales
bottled
on
date
of
11603
90
shilling
is
a
dark
reddish
amber
color
with
a
nice
medium
head
its
aroma
has
subtle
hints
of
citrus
and
caramel
very
nice
tasting
with
hints
of
fig
and
a
good
hoppy
finish
it
doesnt
taste
like
a
normal
scottish
ale
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
one
of
my
old
reliables
dark
hazy
reddish
brown
in
color
with
a
decent
off
white
head
that
sticks
to
my
glass
bready
and
caramel
aromas
starts
sweet
and
creamy
with
a
hint
of
caramel
medium
bodied
nice
creamy
and
round
mouthfeel
finishes
smooth
and
clean
another
good
one
from
this
brewery
very
drinkable
thanks
to
bditty
for
another
dandy
thanks
to
prana
for
sending
me
this
i
like
getting
my
hands
on
90
shilling
beers
as
i
am
a
fan
of
the
style
i
didnt
think
this
one
was
quite
as
good
as
hosters
version
but
it
was
decent
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
medium
beige
head
and
thin
lacing
earthy
malt
aroma
body
is
fairly
rich
with
flavors
of
malt
caramel
and
a
little
fruit
finish
is
lightly
bitter
overall
pretty
good
overall
this
was
a
disappointing
beer
i
have
liked
all
the
other
odell
offerings
that
i
have
had
maybe
i
got
a
bad
bottle
i
will
have
to
give
this
beer
another
try
i
can
see
this
being
very
popular
on
the
other
hand
it
doesnt
quite
hold
enough
interest
for
me
ah
well
drinkup
folks
this
brew
comes
right
off
the
brewery
tap
with
a
deep
dark
copper
color
and
a
foamy
thick
whitish
head
the
aroma
is
malty
with
a
light
hint
of
smoke
and
heavy
spice
hops
the
body
is
smooth
and
supports
a
dry
malt
character
and
a
lingering
mellow
bitterness
not
bad
a
little
too
clean
could
use
a
little
more
oomph
90
shilling
colorado
ale
is
a
stick
to
your
ribs
ale
thick
and
luscious
orangebrown
in
color
with
a
cream
colored
head
that
holds
up
fairly
well
and
leaves
some
nice
belgianlace
the
aroma
is
really
pleasing
with
a
sweet
maltiness
that
contains
caramel
toffee
and
a
touch
of
fruitiness
almost
like
a
combination
of
munich
and
brown
malts
but
not
quite
rich
but
not
aggressive
the
body
and
carbonation
level
are
appropriate
the
flavor
starts
malty
and
fruity
dries
a
bit
at
mid
swallow
and
then
gives
a
spritz
of
hop
flavor
before
leading
into
a
lightly
bitter
dryness
quite
scottish
in
nature
up
to
a
point
but
i
find
the
hop
flavor
unusual
the
choice
of
hops
seems
a
little
odd
still
a
good
beer
90
shilling
is
an
excellent
amber
a
richer
and
heavier
body
than
most
ambers
brown
sugar
pepper
and
pine
create
an
unusually
tasteflavor
palate
reminds
me
of
red
rocket
by
bear
republic
only
more
subdued
this
is
good
beer
but
nothing
exceptional
about
it
thanks
to
jaybeerman
for
the
sample
there
are
a
myriad
of
ambers
out
there
but
this
one
ranks
among
the
best
to
me
this
defines
the
style
but
improves
on
it
a
pronouced
hop
bitterness
for
an
amber
and
flavor
is
perfectly
balanced
by
a
mellow
but
significant
caramel
malt
profile
with
an
almost
chewy
maltiness
and
full
body
to
complements
the
hop
profile
90
shilling
exhibits
a
rich
balance
lightly
earthy
hop
flavor
seems
to
be
combination
of
goldings
and
willamette
it
finishes
with
a
slight
toasty
caramel
sweetness
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
an
excellent
and
highly
drinkable
amber
its
akin
to
an
esb
minus
the
fruitiness
this
is
great
stuff
wonderful
flavor
a
taste
of
the
west
notes
a
proud
beer
that
was
crafted
for
maximum
drinkability
and
a
superb
balance
this
is
what
american
amber
ales
are
all
about
can
poured
a
copper
color
ale
with
a
medium
size
foamy
head
with
ok
retention
and
some
lacing
aroma
of
light
caramelized
malt
with
some
grainy
cereal
notes
taste
is
also
dominated
by
caramelized
notes
with
some
grainy
cereal
notes
body
is
light
with
good
carbonation
this
one
is
short
on
complexity
and
balanced
overall
a
pretty
decent
light
session
version
of
a
scottish
ale
nice
creamy
and
toasty
malt
flavors
very
light
bodied
with
a
focus
on
malts
toffee
caramel
toast
but
some
spicy
herbal
hops
for
balance
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
definitely
sessionable
but
not
super
interesting
o
great
example
of
the
style
really
enjoying
this
as
a
post
dinner
brew
thanks
to
my
bro
for
bringing
from
his
road
trip
back
from
fargo
translucent
ruddy
copper
with
a
transient
head
and
no
lacing
smell
is
faintly
malt
citrus
caramel
and
a
bit
earthy
taste
is
muted
caramel
earth
a
tad
spice
some
citrus
bright
carbonation
a
medium
to
light
body
this
beer
is
very
mild
all
the
way
around
i
like
my
scottish
ales
with
a
little
more
oomph
not
sure
i
would
choose
this
over
say
a
low
abv
pale
ale
of
some
sort
just
does
not
bring
enough
interesting
flavor
too
sweet
for
my
palate
as
well
drinkability
its
a
very
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
by
decent
flavors
and
aromas
o
a
very
nice
and
traditional
tasting
scottish
ale
ever
time
i
have
a
scottish
ale
i
wish
more
breweries
would
make
one
fargo
brewing
has
better
offerings
this
one
is
designed
for
mass
appeal
overall
decent
overall
im
sure
its
a
welcome
alternative
to
the
majority
thats
available
where
in
nd
many
thanks
to
my
friend
and
colleague
steph
for
bringing
this
back
for
me
youre
the
best
i
was
more
impressed
with
the
ipa
i
had
on
tap
this
is
out
of
bottle
and
contract
brewed
at
sand
creek
i
think
the
kegs
come
from
there
too
but
i
am
not
certain
they
have
a
very
uninformative
website
and
facebook
site
overall
a
poor
attempt
at
the
style
maybe
brewed
with
the
delicate
scandanavian
palate
in
mind
either
way
if
fbc
wants
to
make
an
ale
of
this
style
make
it
more
authentic
please
this
just
comes
off
to
me
as
a
pub
grub
washer
downer
with
a
little
bit
of
flavour
for
good
measure
overall
certainly
not
the
best
scotch
out
there
id
like
to
see
the
sweetness
matched
with
a
little
peat
or
roasted
flavor
and
the
carbonation
toned
down
a
little
on
tap
at
jl
beers
in
grand
forks
served
at
adequate
temperature
into
a
pint
glass
poured
a
rich
brown
fairly
clear
and
without
much
action
and
therefore
not
much
head
or
lacing
ive
never
been
able
to
pick
up
much
aroma
in
a
bar
too
much
air
moving
but
some
faint
grain
was
distinguishable
taste
was
on
the
lighter
side
but
for
such
a
low
abv
beer
it
was
to
be
expected
some
caramel
malt
not
all
that
peaty
but
some
nuttiness
perhaps
mouth
was
smooth
and
solid
for
a
lighter
beer
went
down
way
too
easily
and
way
too
fast
if
by
some
miracle
i
could
replace
bud
with
this
beer
as
the
light
easy
to
drink
standby
id
be
perfectly
happy
with
that
i
like
my
scots
a
bit
beefier
than
this
but
for
as
light
a
beer
as
it
is
it
performs
fairly
well
the
beer
arrived
a
dark
mahogany
color
with
a
decent
cap
of
foam
the
beer
was
ice
cold
even
as
it
warmed
the
aroma
was
difficult
to
ascertain
but
faint
grains
were
lingering
light
and
a
little
carbonated
on
the
palate
the
malt
flavors
mainly
consisted
of
caramel
flavors
but
was
not
very
strong
i
would
like
to
see
some
more
assertive
malt
character
from
a
scottish
ale
overall
not
a
bad
attempt
at
the
style
another
great
on
from
fargo
brewing
had
this
on
tap
at
jl
beers
in
fargo
pours
a
see
through
dark
brown
colors
with
a
nice
thick
white
head
that
leaves
a
nice
creamy
white
ring
smell
is
of
sweet
malt
caramel
and
with
some
nutty
smell
the
taste
is
very
smooth
up
front
its
malty
and
carbonated
with
a
very
sweet
nutty
after
taste
well
done
again
keep
it
up
guys
this
was
a
decent
beer
im
on
the
fence
about
whether
its
worth
buying
a
6pack
of
i
just
got
one
bottle
as
part
of
a
buildyourown
was
expecting
more
not
a
great
scottish
ale
overall
a
really
good
ale
i
would
definitely
drink
this
again
nice
dark
golden
color
very
light
and
smooth
taste
overall
this
was
a
very
good
beer
great
toasted
malt
flavor
balanced
well
with
hops
and
caramellike
sweetness
im
a
little
unsure
if
the
sediment
floating
in
the
beer
was
intentional
or
not
but
it
doesnt
affect
the
flavor
or
mouthfeel
just
the
appearance
overall
this
beer
gets
a
b
and
an
85100
from
me
if
you
like
the
sweet
grainy
notes
toffee
and
molasses
and
a
hoppy
beer
this
one
is
for
you
the
beer
is
fairly
dry
so
its
gone
before
you
realize
it
id
say
get
some
its
pretty
awesome
pours
a
clear
medium
amber
producing
2
fingers
of
beige
frothy
somewhat
lasting
head
that
leaves
a
super
coating
of
pasty
lacing
aroma
is
lightly
toasted
pumpernickel
bread
caramel
apple
with
hints
of
butter
roasted
nuts
floral
hops
a
faint
earthiness
taste
is
similar
to
nose
with
more
toast
apple
fruitiness
floral
hops
pepper
graham
crackers
dark
honey
are
added
the
bitterness
is
nicely
balanced
with
the
toasted
maltiness
finishes
wet
but
faintly
dry
if
that
makes
sense
peppery
with
toast
that
becomes
a
toasty
dark
tea
like
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
no
smoke
or
burnt
noteshints
detectable
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
moderately
carbonated
lightly
prickly
o
glad
this
isnt
spiced
like
most
christmas
or
winter
beers
not
bad
mild
could
be
a
little
heavier
in
body
and
abv
way
better
than
spiced
beers
great
malty
holiday
flavor
i
would
highly
recommend
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
burntorange
in
color
with
close
to
a
1finger
creamy
offwhite
head
with
some
sheets
of
lacing
seen
when
sipped
sediment
is
seen
at
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
around
the
edges
the
aroma
is
of
malts
for
the
most
part
with
some
spice
pretty
much
the
same
is
said
for
the
taste
with
some
hops
with
a
hint
of
orange
also
the
finish
is
slightly
dry
but
not
bad
mediumbodied
with
perfect
carbonation
for
this
style
of
brew
overall
it
wasnt
bad
for
a
scottish
ale
very
nice
light
tasting
beer
for
a
dark
color
also
taste
some
apple
cider
not
too
bad
for
a
scotch
ale
pretty
nice
malt
and
not
smoky
like
some
in
this
category
pours
a
light
brown
smells
nice
and
is
consistent
with
most
christmas
beers
get
a
little
bit
of
hops
and
some
sweetness
in
the
smell
taste
the
hops
almost
has
a
lemon
taste
that
gives
it
the
bitterness
and
they
are
not
overwhelming
some
sweetness
that
matches
the
smell
a
good
holiday
beer
not
the
best
but
good
on
tap
at
the
mellow
mushroom
phoenix
i
was
hoping
for
something
and
got
nothing
nothing
of
this
beer
is
christmas
average
at
best
this
would
be
good
named
bells
average
ale
i
am
not
a
fan
picked
up
a
six
of
this
at
tw
before
xmas
had
some
on
xmas
eve
and
xmas
saved
one
to
review
lets
give
it
whirl
popping
the
top
i
get
a
nice
deep
zesty
caramel
waft
pours
to
a
light
root
beer
color
with
a
thin
tan
head
on
the
taste
this
brew
has
good
mouthfeel
thick
but
not
syrup
tick
the
taste
is
a
consistent
slightly
spicy
flatly
bitter
yet
with
bits
of
sweet
caramel
coming
through
not
really
dominant
in
one
flavor
or
another
balanced
and
contrite
would
have
expected
a
little
darker
a
little
spicier
for
a
christmas
beer
along
the
lines
of
a
winter
warmer
but
its
imbibeable
good
taste
reminds
me
nothing
of
christmas
mouthfeel
medium
light
body
and
sprightly
carbonation
excellent
winter
warmer
i
enjoy
it
every
year
not
sure
what
a
scottish
ale
has
to
do
with
christmas
but
nevertheless
a
tasty
and
very
easy
drinking
ale
three
of
the
six
pack
gone
in
the
blink
of
an
eye
could
have
easily
killed
the
other
three
if
it
had
been
one
of
those
type
of
nights
shlante
aroma
is
slightly
sweet
caramel
malt
with
soft
notes
of
cinnamon
fairly
subtle
flavor
reveals
a
clashing
slightly
sourspecialty
malt
fruitiness
and
a
bitter
finish
toffee
notes
are
welcome
but
clash
again
with
floral
and
perfumey
hops
a
very
good
session
ale
malty
but
well
balanced
just
a
very
wholesome
flavor
that
screams
quality
not
sure
id
call
it
a
scottish
ale
though
amber
in
color
with
some
red
tinting
i
see
an
abundance
of
light
sediment
suspended
in
the
body
theres
a
half
inch
of
small
and
tightly
packed
foam
that
appears
beige
with
a
hint
of
amber
i
smell
some
slightly
earthy
barley
and
i
dont
pick
up
anything
else
i
taste
that
earthy
to
gently
sweet
barley
along
with
a
subtle
use
of
piney
hops
the
hops
are
definitely
muted
with
no
bite
and
are
meant
to
keep
the
barley
sweetness
in
check
the
mouth
is
creamy
and
smooth
a
really
inyourface
maltiness
as
in
the
malt
acts
like
hops
would
in
a
pungent
ipa
a
very
balanced
beer
with
bittering
hops
coming
in
to
act
as
a
foil
to
all
the
malt
once
you
settle
in
with
this
beer
it
grows
on
you
good
alternative
to
huge
andor
spiced
xmas
beers
when
i
first
started
drinking
this
beer
i
thought
meh

i
am
not
sure
why
people
think
this
is
a
scotch
scottish
ale
this
is
definitely
a
hoppy
pale
ale
of
some
sort
it
is
really
interesting
how
many
people
missed
the
dominant
hop
character
bc
someone
mistakenly
labeled
this
as
scottish
whatever
that
means

overpower
everything
its

not
what
it
can
be
its
not
bad
but
its
forgettable
o
while
im
not
getting
how
this
is
a
christmas
beer
i
think
its
a
nicely
drinkable
scottish
ale
that
i
could
enjoy
yearround
o
its
pretty
good
if
i
hadnt
read
it
i
would
not
have
pegged
it
for
a
scottish
i
just
assumed
it
was
a
winter
warmer
its
christmas
in
march
thanks
to
this
beer
sure
its
not
quite
christmas
in
july
but
rudolph
and
frosty
cant
be
everywhere
at
all
times
anyway
it
pours
a
generally
clear
light
russetamber
topped
by
a
finger
of
creamwhite
foam
a
healthy
population
of
particulates
wafts
about
the
glass
the
nose
comprises
caramel
orange
peel
light
red
grapes
and
a
pinch
of
nutmeg
the
taste
follows
pretty
closely
though
with
the
addition
of
some
mild
toffee
and
some
cinnamon
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
lightly
grainy
feel
overall
a
nice
scottish
ale
nothing
special
but
tasty
and
enjoyable
d
nice
drinkability
here
i
would
drink
this
again
for
sure
winter
isnt
my
favorite
season
for
beer
but
i
found
this
to
be
a
welcome
brew
id
drink
this
again
for
sure
drinkabilty
is
pretty
good
this
is
a
nice
crisp
clean
beer
but
is
lacking
on
characteristics
expected
for
a
holiday
seasonal
beer
drinkability
despite
being
this
is
an
easy
beer
to
drink
and
nice
to
taste
poured
into
a
pint
glass
it
has
a
nice
hazy
orange
color
light
bodied
the
aroma
is
of
orange
peel
and
herbal
scents
followed
by
some
yeasty
notes
the
flavor
is
quite
bitter
and
you
lose
the
citrus
and
breadiness
of
it
the
toffeeflavored
toasted
malts
are
too
apparent
as
there
is
a
lingering
aftertaste
and
slight
alcohol
finish
not
bad
but
couldnt
see
myself
sitting
around
the
fireplace
long
enough
for
a
session
like
i
normally
expect
a
fine
christmas
ale
to
be
overall
this
beer
wasnt
very
impressive
at
all
it
was
just
very
bland
and
lacked
and
special
character
or
solidness
to
it
finish
is
simple
light
bitter
coffee
drinkability
wow
this
is
pretty
sad
bells
normally
delivers
in
the
flavor
department
but
this
was
just
flat
and
boring
d
this
beer
is
fine
uninspiring
but
fine
i
would
have
another
one
backtoback
to
this
if
something
else
wasnt
available
but
if
a
selecation
was
available
to
me
i
would
choose
to
move
on
to
something
else
drinks
easy
enough
a
nice
one
to
relax
by
the
fire

couple
bottles
a
month
after
purchase
it
was
going
down

fast
poured
from
12
oz
bottle
into
dimpled
mug
the
pour
yields
a
clear
dark
reddishorange
amber
colored
body
a
spongy
head
of
khaki
colored
foam
settles
quickly
leaving
a
frothy
skin
on
the
surface
and
some
jagged
flares
and
spots
on
the
glass
despite
the
malty
claim
on
the
description
this
is
one
hoppy
scotch
ale
which
isnt
really
true
to
its
style
notes
of
pine
grass
and
grapefruit
come
across
as
a
christmasy
taste
lending
bright
bittering
notes
to
the
underlying
base
of
toasted
bread
honey
and
lightly
bronzed
sugars
flavors
are
similarly
structured
striking
a
nice
balance
between
resinous
citrusy
hops
dough
toast
and
light
toffeehoney
sweetness
the
palate
is
mediumplus
in
stature
lively
carbonated
finishing
grassy
resinous
and
semidry
it
is
a
weird
and
nontraditional
scottish
ale
bells
interesting
some
many
exceptional
beers
and
quite
a
few
every
day
drinkers
that
could
be
a
notch
up
all
in
all
though
one
of
the
best
brewerys
in
this
fair
country
drinkability
way
too
much
carbonation
fairly
mild
flavor
not
much
there
especially
for
the
abv
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
bells
christmas
ale
is
an
amberorange
color
with
a
frothy
white
head
probably
on
the
lighter
side
of
the
color
spectrum
for
a
scottish
ale
the
nose
is
a
mixture
of
crystal
malt
caramel
and
west
coast
citrusy
hops
the
flavor
has
a
big
upfront
hoppiness
to
it
citrus
and
pine
resin
and
then
mellows
into
a
better
balance
as
the
sweeter
caramel
notes
come
out
however
the
brew
does
lean
towards
the
hoppy
side
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
side
slightly
dry
with
a
creamy
carbonation
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
a
very
good
beer
but
im
not
sure
how
it
fits
in
as
a
scottish
ale
i
think
it
may
have
rated
better
in
a
different
category
overall
bells
christmas
ale
is
a
very
good
example
of
a
scottish
ale
i
spent
6
months
in
scotland
last
year
and
tried
my
fair
share
of
scottish
ales
and
this
brew
is
one
of
the
better
examples
ive
had
that
being
said
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
scottish
ales
as
they
are
too
light
on
the
flavor
but
ive
enjoyed
this
beer
d
i
dont
remember
it
being
this
great
out
of
the
bottle
but
it
sure
impressed
me
on
tap
great
flavor
and
surprisingly
smooth
low
abv
scotch
ale
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
carbonation
is
moderate
drinkability
isnt
bad
it
went
down
pretty
easily
and
had
some
decent
flavors
it
wasnt
bad
at
all
but
it
also
just
wasnt
all
that
special
either
it
seemed
pretty
plain
for
a
xmas
beer
as
well
poured
into
a
pint
glass
this
brew
was
a
nice
red
amber
color
mostly
transparent
with
a
1
finger
white
head
that
dissipated
to
a
thin
cap
with
decent
lacing
down
the
glass
the
aroma
was
nice
with
a
good
citrus
hop
presence
and
a
solid
caramel
malt
essence
truth
be
told
i
was
expecting
more
of
a
winter
warmer
style
which
tends
to
be
too
over
the
top
spicy
with
cinnamon
and
clove
and
the
like
but
this
brew
being
a
scottish
ale
was
nice
and
balanced
the
caramel
malts
hit
the
front
of
your
tongue
while
the
slight
citrus
and
pine
hops
hit
the
finish
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
crisp
finish
this
is
a
fine
ale
to
sip
on
good
session
brew
in
my
opinion
this
goes
down
well
the
fruity
flavors
make
each
drink
worth
it
the
moderate
alcohol
mean
you
can
have
several
getting
down
and
dirty
ive
decided
this
isnt
my
cup
of
tea
at
all
and
im
somewhat
struggling
to
finish
the
bottle
bells
makes
some
really
excellent
brews
so
its
no
big
deal
that
i
didnt
find
the
christmas
ale
to
my
liking
another
quality
bells
offerering
not
your
typical
spiced
christmas
ale
brewed
with
locally
grown
ingredients
kudus
bells
drinkability
this
beer
is
alright
wouldnt
be
my
first
choice
for
a
winterchristmas
brew
but
ok
none
the
less
its
easily
drinkable
with
tame
aromas
and
flavors
i
would
drink
it
again
if
it
was
offered
drinkability
a
cool
take
on
the
style
for
the
season
drinkable
sessionable
and
a
good
amalgam
of
flavors
for
the
season
merry
christmas
everyone
this
beer
is
quite
refreshing
and
not
heavy
on
the
gut
or
the
head
i
might
make
this
a
goto
session
beer
this
holiday
season
dnice
drinkable
beer
but
there
are
a
lot
like
that
if
i
want
a
holiday
beer
from
bells
id
rather
reach
for
an
expedition
scratch
off
the
label
and
write
holiday
beer
in
black
market
to
appease
myself
as
a
beer
this
is
decent
as
a
holiday
special
beer
it
is
a
disappointment
ill
rate
it
as
a
beer
an
apa
d
highly
drinkable
because
there
isnt
too
much
to
think
about
and
it
wont
wear
your
tastebuds
out
although
i
was
expecting
a
bit
more
flavor
drinkability
the
orange
aspect
to
this
beer
is
unusual
but
i
think
it
works
for
a
christmas
ale
i
think
of
oranges
as
gifts
during
the
holidays
and
with
the
orange
balanced
out
by
the
malt
it
comes
out
as
a
sipping
beer
to
savor
on
a
cold
evening
its
certainly
festive
however
i
found
i
could
not
have
another
one
by
the
end
one
is
enough
but
it
is
definitely
not
a
scottish
ale
and
should
not
be
thought
as
such
nor
rated
as
such
its
a
malt
forward
beer
but
with
enough
hop
bitterness
to
make
it
balanced
notes
of
toast
caramel
and
a
slight
hint
of
cotton
candy
are
present
it
would
be
good
to
drink
with
a
meal
its
got
enough
flavor
to
pair
with
a
wide
variety
of
foods
without
being
overwhelming
or
as
a
session
beer
i
like
it
pretty
well
but
if
you
are
looking
for
something
with
some
seasonal
spice
or
something
big
and
hearty
this
wont
fit
the
bill
if
youre
entertaining
and
want
to
stock
a
beer
thats
drinkable
but
has
enough
flavor
that
beer
snobs
wont
scoff
this
would
do
nicely
when
i
ordered
this
i
did
not
realize
it
was
a
scottish
ale
this
only
further
proves
the
point
that
this
beer
isnt
up
to
snuff
i
had
no
notiion
at
all
that
this
was
anything
other
than
an
attempt
at
a
spiced
christmas
ale
d
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
however
it
would
not
be
what
i
was
expecting
or
wanted
if
i
were
ordering
a
christmas
ale
average
scottish
ale
but
drinkable
enough
glad
i
just
bought
a
single
though
d
this
was
a
nice
beer
to
have
on
a
cold
winter
day
really
enjoyed
it
a
lot
better
on
draft
than
in
the
bottle
d
a
really
superb
scottish
ale
on
mark
for
the
style
and
a
really
good
choice
by
bells
for
a
winter
ale
d
high
overall
a
very
solid
offering
a
nice
change
up
for
a
winter
beer
not
sure
about
the
scottish
ale
side
of
it
but
damn
nice
d
if
it
matters
it
is
certainly
easy
to
drink
but
very
mild
and
unimpressive
this
is
a
christmas
seasonal
i
will
likely
pass
over
in
the
future
d
its
a
vary
drinkable
beer
the
taste
is
not
to
strong
to
kill
your
taste
buds
im
ready
to
have
another
one
only
if
i
didnt
have
to
work
tomorrow
maybe
the
best
christmas
ale
of
the
season
overall
not
what
i
was
expecting
but
not
terrible
just
doesnt
quite
fit
the
season
perhaps
bells
should
come
out
with
a
second
heavier
version
of
this
stuff
then
id
be
satisfied
could
i
drink
a
lot
of
this
sure
would
i
want
to
no
not
really
this
beer
certainly
doesnt
fit
its
description
and
that
withstanding
is
still
not
a
great
beer
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
thinner
medium
body
higher
carbonation
a
little
chewy
drinks
okay
but
i
really
wasnt
impressed
with
the
flavor
and
pretty
much
wanted
to
be
through
with
this
to
get
to
something
better
d
this
is
a
very
easy
to
drink
beer
which
should
be
expected
it
is
not
good
though
the
taste
was
of
hops
and
citrus
and
small
hints
of
spices
i
thought
it
was
great
but
it
tastes
more
like
a
mild
ipa
than
a
christmas
ale
overall
not
nearly
as
good
as
oberon
there
are
many
excellent
holiday
offerings
out
there
if
youre
looking
for
something
to
excite
you
dont
look
here
if
youre
looking
for
something
that
your
lite
drinking
sisterinlaw
might
consent
to
drink
you
might
try
this
d
drinkable
and
pleasant
d
with
no
overpowering
spices
this
year
this
beer
is
a
joy
to
drink
d
good
one
to
serve
to
my
family
or
friends
who
is
not
into
craft
beers
almost
reminds
of
budweiser
select
wont
be
buying
it
again
might
even
be
in
my
fridge
till
next
christmas
lol
pours
a
nice
lookin
amber
all
downhill
from
that
point
on
scent
is
dull
and
taste
is
light
and
unimpressive
im
a
big
fan
of
winterchristmas
beers
for
their
robust
scents
and
complex
flavors
this
beer
falls
short
in
all
aspects
as
far
as
what
i
look
for
in
a
winter
seasonal
ale
oh
well
off
to
the
next
the
aroma
is
modest
some
nutty
character
and
malt
combine
to
convince
you
are
drinking
a
brown
beer
but
nothing
else
i
would
expect
a
deeper
malt
character
for
a
scotch
ale
more
of
the
same
on
the
palate
nonsweet
malt
which
morphs
into
a
dry
hop
character
at
the
end
it
finishes
a
little
pepper
which
must
be
from
the
hops
for
a
christmas
ale
comment
on
the
lack
of
spice
for
a
scotch
ale
i
would
ask
for
more
malt
and
less
hop
drinks
easily
nothing
terribly
strong
or
offputting
from
a
flavor
perspective
the
first
thing
you
notice
is
that
this
beer
is
too
bitterhoppy
to
be
a
scottish
ale
and
honestly
isnt
my
style
for
my
favorite
beer
season
christmas
mouth
is
a
little
thin
this
beer
is
made
for
the
hopheads
not
those
of
us
who
love
scottish
or
christmas
beers
at
least
in
my
opinion
pours
a
hazy
amber
with
a
thin
soapy
head
and
little
carbonation
nose
is
amber
malt
with
mild
seasonal
spices
a
little
nutty
taste
is
mostly
the
rounded
amber
malt
a
little
toasted
almond
clove
and
coriander
a
little
bittering
hops
medium
body
lightened
somewhat
by
the
spices
not
bad
overall
a
good
solid
winter
amber
ale
thats
not
too
inyourface
with
the
spices
light
head
finger
of
light
tan
to
eggshell
white
lots
of
larger
bubbles
which
dissipate
at
a
rapid
clip
doesnt
come
up
with
much
lacing
gauzy
orange
rust
in
color
with
a
burnt
red
dirt
edge
slight
loss
of
depth
at
the
rims
loosely
arranged
bubbles
spread
throughout
the
glass
clean
evanescence
to
the
nose
dried
grass
and
straw
peat
moss
pepper
and
sage
mild
caramel
and
chocolate
accents
as
it
warms
you
get
more
apricot
peach
yellow
apple
scents
as
well
as
scone
soda
bread
and
honey
mediumbodied
here
the
carbonation
too
active
prevents
many
of
the
flavors
from
finding
a
center
and
then
soaking
in
noticeably
dry
leads
once
more
with
a
grassy
earthiness
followed
on
by
dry
grapefruit
orange
pith
the
yellow
apple
pear
apricot
fruit
tenuous
in
turn
not
enough
honey
toffee
to
elevate
overall
sweetness
and
bolster
the
fruit
smidge
of
pepper
and
other
bitter
herbs
leading
into
a
sour
finish
not
horrible
but
doesnt
make
you
especially
want
another
bottle
overall
a
malty
and
nutty
beers
with
faint
hop
presence
not
very
impressive
for
a
brewery
like
bells
d
bells
has
done
better
work
but
this
isnt
a
wholly
undrinkable
beer
i
love
scottish
ales
and
this
is
a
good
example
by
an
american
brewery
d
at
5
4
its
definitely
not
hard
to
have
several
of
these
and
it
isnt
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
so
id
say
its
slighty
abover
average
as
a
drinker
meh
not
my
favorite
seasonal
this
season
but
it
was
balanced
decently
easy
to
drink
if
you
arent
looking
for
an
overwhelming
taste
bonanza
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
good
beer
i
was
not
wowed
by
it
but
i
would
buy
this
again
specifically
for
the
holidays
the
combination
of
fruits
and
spices
make
this
a
worthy
christmas
ale
good
job
bells
notes
where
did
the
flavor
go
im
rereviewing
this
and
is
nothing
like
my
notes
sometimes
i
wonder
who
is
tasting
for
consistency
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
merlot
glass
golden
in
color
with
a
little
bit
of
ruby
red
theres
a
2
finger
white
head
that
has
good
retention
and
lacing
this
isnt
a
strong
smelling
beer
but
i
get
some
light
fruit
and
floral
aromas
the
taste
follows
the
nose
and
also
has
some
added
nutmegwinter
spices
the
main
fruit
tastes
i
noticed
were
cherries
and
apples
the
carbonation
on
this
is
a
little
high
but
gives
it
a
nice
crisp
clean
finish
especially
with
the
spices
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
would
have
it
again
pours
a
hazed
coppery
brown
color
with
decent
cap
of
khaki
head
scent
brings
forward
a
mix
of
sweet
carmel
malts
roasted
nuts
citrusy
hops
and
some
prunefig
like
qualities
taste
starts
with
the
citrusy
hops
followed
by
a
5050
mix
of
sweet
malts
and
roasted
nuts
the
back
end
features
the
lingering
notes
of
dark
dried
fruits
medium
bodied
slightly
high
in
carbonation
a
decent
beer
but
the
strange
mix
can
overpower
the
palate
akin
to
a
very
hoppy
brown
ale
in
my
opinion
drinkability
sweet
with
a
crisp
finish
overall
i
didnt
know
what
to
expect
from
this
beer
i
heard
many
of
tales
some
say
they
can
taste
some
hops
like
an
american
pale
ale
to
some
say
it
was
a
weaker
brown
ale
to
me
this
brew
is
what
i
would
define
as
a
basic
brew
its
not
to
much
of
one
thing
but
in
the
middle
i
bet
they
use
the
yeast
in
their
two
hearted
as
the
same
in
this
brew
md
a
bit
sticky
on
the
lips
but
not
sweet
reminds
me
a
bit
of
wassail
but
not
something
i
would
seek
out
an
entire
six
pack
could
be
a
great
beer
to
use
during
the
holidays
to
convert
noncraft
dinners
though
drink
well
to
all
and
to
all
a
good
drink
d
simple
in
nature
and
relatively
easy
to
drink
i
wouldnt
want
more
than
one
however
the
taste
of
cherry
makes
this
a
difficult
beer
to
drink
would
not
recommend
more
than
one
md
good
carbination
somewhat
sweet
with
a
crisp
finish
it
was
just
a
good
beer
nothing
breath
taking
however
perfect
for
friends
and
family
nothing
to
overwhelming
drinkability
certainly
inoffensive
enough
to
drink
several
but
its
just
a
little
too
boring
pours
an
orangishamber
with
one
finger
head
and
good
lacing
nose
of
caramel
malt
and
scotchpeat
smoked
malt
essence
sweet
sugary
malt
at
the
front
hoppy
finish
wheat
in
the
aftertaste
medium
light
body
and
highly
drinkable
decent
brew
for
the
season
overall
pretty
bland
but
not
bad
just
kind
of
neutral
but
simple
enough
to
be
a
good
one
to
share
at
a
holiday
get
together
though
far
from
a
scottish
or
christmas
ale
in
any
sense
d
this
was
surprisingly
decent
im
glad
that
they
didnt
spice
this
like
every
other
christmas
on
the
market
it
was
one
of
the
best
options
available
at
the
kilt
so
i
may
be
having
it
again
sometime
pours
a
light
amber
color
with
generous
sized
white
frothy
head
nose
is
on
the
lighter
side
but
clearly
bready
and
grainy
palate
is
mostly
toasty
flavors
perhaps
with
some
dry
twigs
in
there
too
hops
have
some
light
spicing
to
round
it
out
so
the
malt
isnt
terribly
sweet
overall
finishes
toasty
again
perhaps
biscuity
happy
holidays
a
sloppy
pour
yielded
half
a
glass
of
beige
head
the
beer
is
burnt
amber
colored
there
is
not
a
lot
going
on
with
this
beer
i
get
some
caramel
malt
on
the
nose
and
a
little
bit
of
citrus
hops
the
taste
is
caramel
malt
thats
about
it
this
is
a
simple
beer
that
goes
down
easy
but
if
you
want
a
lot
of
taste
this
isnt
for
you
im
not
sure
why
its
a
christmas
beer
it
seems
like
an
everyday
drinker
ontap
at
flying
saucer
served
in
a
standard
pint
glass
a
crisp
amber
with
a
thin
khaki
head
aroma
is
a
nice
amount
of
burnt
caramel
malts
the
taste
is
smooth
caramel
malts
with
slight
sweet
fruits
and
a
hint
of
cinnamon
the
beer
is
fairly
light
bodied
with
mild
carbonation
this
is
a
decent
winter
beer
but
it
seems
like
beer
that
could
be
enjoyed
yearround
bells
calls
this
a
malt
driven
ale
and
that
is
exactly
what
you
get
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
does
not
rely
too
heavily
on
spicing
to
trick
up
the
beer
those
looking
for
a
unique
experience
will
be
let
down
bells
always
makes
solid
reliable
beers
and
this
is
no
exception
i
rather
enjoy
the
simplicity
of
this
ale
and
would
appreciate
its
humility
after
drinking
some
of
the
more
powerful
christmas
ales
on
the
market
overall
this
beer
was
very
drinkable
and
having
a
couple
of
pints
just
may
be
what
the
doctor
ordered
on
cold
winter
nights
bells
did
the
exact
opposite
of
what
most
breweries
do
for
christmas
ales
and
it
works
well
for
them
drinkability
decent
and
is
more
inline
with
what
i
expect
from
a
christmas
ale
though
i
was
not
expecting
it
from
what
the
back
of
label
and
brewery
website
said
it
is
a
scottish
ale
with
a
tiny
bit
of
edge
tastes
solid
but
unexceptional
the
malt
is
crispfresh
yet
lightly
fruity
like
they
may
have
added
some
orange
zest
the
hops
are
european
dry
and
lightly
bitter
and
the
malt
really
isnt
biscuity
or
sweet
its
blotted
out
by
whatever
the
fruitiness
comes
from
drinkability
very
drinkable
and
a
definite
session
beer
im
not
sure
why
its
called
christmas
ale
but
its
a
nice
wellrounded
brew
when
youre
in
the
mood
for
knocking
a

this
ale
is
sweet
malty
and
yeasty
with
no
real
distinct
flavor
the
feel
is
thick
and
bready
and
it
is
very
drinkable
its
an
enjoyable
beer
and
would
be
very
good
on
warm
days
but
its
not
what
i
expect
from
a
christmas
ale
the
color
is
too
light
and
theres
no
unique
flavor
better
christmas

also
have

christmas
ale
is
not
enough
of
a
coldweather
sipper
to

pours
a
darker
amber
with
a
relatively
thin
head
but
what
head
there
is
sticks
around
for
quite
some
time
as
a
thin

smells
malty
sweet
and
with
a
hint
of
parrafin

their

drinkabilitymouthfeel
its
a
nice
clean
beer
which
almost
seems
to
taste
like
christmas
very
easy
to
enjoy
d
this
is
an
unusual
underwhelming
winter
seasonal
from
bells
as
a
scottish
ale
the
flavor
profile
just
seems
a
little
off
this
could
use
a
more
emphatic
malt
presence
especially
not
the
worst
beer
but
im
glad
i
only
grabbed
a
single
of
this
one
d
very
drinkable
not
heavy
at
all
good
session
beer
but
not
realy
what
i
think
of
as
a
christmas
ale
i
didnt
like
this
one
at
all
definitely
not
a
scottish
ale
its
kind
of
like
a
winter
warmer
which
i
really
dont
like
i
would
pass
on
this
one
holiday
cheer
my
ass
drinkability
very
drinkable
but
not
exciting
or
exceptional
in
any
way
i
guess
im
being
unfair
because
i
expect
more
from
bells
there
isnt
anything
wrong
with
this
beer
it
just
isnt
what
i
look
for
in
a
christmas
beer
drinkability
quite
good
something
i
could
drink
any
time
of
the
year
not
just
christmas
time
md
mouthfeel
is
above
average
goes
down
very
smooth
and
creamy
this
beer
is
more
drinkable
than
your
average
christmas
ale
because
of
the
less
spice
and
great
mouthfeel
pours
a
mber
with
a
tremendous
amount
of
head
huge
hop
smell
for
a
beer
that
the
box
says
is
supposed
to
be
a

christmas
beer
the
head
is
still
around
a
few
minutes
into
drinking
which
is
one
of
the
only
strong
points
of
this
beer
there
is
plenty
of
hop
flavor
making
it
more
like
an
amber
than
a
scottish
ale
i
wonder
why
bells
is
putting
it
out
as
a
christmas
seasonal
when
a
winter
warmer
or
another
stout
would
probably
be
more
apt
for
the
season
a
little
thick
for
easy
drinking
on
second
thought
its
not
a
bad
beer
just
not
at
all
what
i
expected
glad
i
bought
a
single
12oz
bottle
served
in
a
shaker
pint
bottle
conditioned
batch
9423
poured
a
slightly
hazy
amber
with
less
than
a
finger
of
off
white
head
malty
caramel
aroma
medium
bodied
nice
malt
base
with
some
more
caramel
bit
of
a
hop
bite
decent
beer
more
of
an
amber
ale
very
drinkable
but
nothing
spectacular
d
i
enjoyed
the
beer
great
looking
beer
with
bready
malt
qualities
but
i
seek
out
bigger
ales
for
christmas
i
suppose
on
to
the
next
ale
mouthfeel
is
pretty
light
for
a
scottish
ale
this
actually
comes
off
as
more
of
an
amber
ale
i
have
to
admit
im
pretty
disappointed
with
this
for
a
holiday
seasonal
i
was
expecting
more
character
i
really
like
bells
brews
and
this
is
another
to
add
to
the
already
delicious
lineup
whatever
they
are
doing
works
for
me
i
enjoy
everything
they
do
and
this
christmas
ale
will
go
on
my
list
for
future
purchase
d
very
easy
to
drink
and
with
the
abv
low
it
would
be
a
nonissue
not
bad
but
also
not
a
standout
in
any
way
cheers
this
is
a
surprisingly
different
beer
and
not
one
for
labels
simple
and
clean
but
delicious
id
say
all
of
that
makes
for
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
single
from
norms
vienna
va
very
drinkable
for
the
style
not
nearly
the
best
of
this
ilk
of
seasonal
brews
d
great
while
this
is
not
a
scottish
ale
i
cant
really
think
of
where
else
it
should
be
fabulous
taste
to
this
beer
and
i
dont
think
it
gets
the
credit
it
deserves
smooth
and
delicious
d
very
nice
sessionable
beer
might
make
an
appearence
at
my
thanksgiving
table
bells
christmas
ale
is
very
likeable
a
great
simple
malty
session
beer
well
suited
for
the
season
this
is
a
great
beer
for
the
season
i
would
probably
drink
it
yearround
if
available
i
hope
no
one
passes
it
up
based
on
the
okay
overall
rating
if
i
wasnt
rating
within
style
i
think
my
score
would
be
higher
more
like
a
rye
beer
to
me
than
a
scotch
cheers
overallvery
smooth
creamy
and
tasty
would
make
a
fine
session
beera
bit
surprising
that
this
is
considered
a
scotch
ale
but
whatever
the
style
its
a
tasty
offering
d
moderate
drinkability
abv
is
manageable
sweetness
isnt
overwhelming
not
filling
does
have
a
solid
warming
effect
good
for
winter
d
good
but
was
expecting
something
more
than
this
a
great
session
beer
but
definitely
not
what
i
thought
this
would
be
didnt
think
this
was
a
scotch
ale
until
i
looked
it
up
definitely
doesnt
smell
or
taste
as
such
drinkability
an
easy
drinker
with
its
low
abv
glad
to
have
sampled
such
a
unique
brew
overall
this
is
a
solid
low
abv
scotch
ale
worth
a
shot
a
good
but
fairly
bland
scotch
ale
theres
nothing
particularly
wrong
with
this
beer
but
it
also
fails
to
provide
much
excitement
the
beer
pours
a
murky
medium
amber
with
a
spattering
of
particulates
and
a
medium
headlacing
the
aroma
is
subdued
theres
light
caramelized
malt
with
touches
of
spice
and
apricotsapple
the
flavor
is
similar
and
similarly
fails
to
provide
any
really
interesting
notes
a
scotch
ale
needs
more
punch
than
this
one
provides
for
me
to
find
enjoyment
this
beer
tastes
more
like
a
watered
down
scotch
ale
its
not
bad
just
fairly
bland
and
middleoftheroad
for
the
style
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
good
carbonation
nice
and
malty
overall
still
the
flavor
is
just
a
bit
too
mild
for
me
and
i
guess
im
not
personally
a
big
scotch
ale
fan
i
was
happy
to
sample
it
but
it
doesnt
make
me
want
to
grab
another
if
youre
a
malt
lover
check
it
out
translucent
muddy
amber
color
with
a
rocky
fizzy
cream
head
that
has
sticky
clumps
and
rings
of
lacing
and
nice
retention
as
promising
as
the
appearance
is
the
aroma
is
comparatively
lacking
grainy
toasted
malt
biscuit
occasionally
light
fruit
all
very
mild
while
not
expecting
this
to
be
a
bomb
of
a
wee
heavy
this
doesnt
resemble
much
of
anything
in
the
aroma
medium
body
with
light
fluffy
carbonation
and
slight
hop
bite
in
finish
not
as
heavy
or
thick
as
expected
for
a
true
scotch
ale
but
pleasant
nothing
to
complain
about
flavor
has
large
caramel
malty
backbone
slightly
fruity
sweet
yeasty
flavor
not
bad
but
even
for
not
expecting
this
to
be
a
true
scotch
ale
somewhat
disappointing
all
that
said
still
a
pleasantly
drinkable
beer
and
tastes
much
better
to
me
at
start
of
summer
than
it
did
in
middle
of
winter
drinks
pretty
easy
not
as
much
to
the
beer
as
i
thoght
there
mibht
be
i
honestly
dont
know
what
to
think
about
this
beer
its
really
not
a
christmas
ale
and
it
didnt
taste
like
a
scotch
ale
to
me
either
i
dont
know
what
it
was
i
probably
should
have
had
this
beer
during
the
christmas
holiday
instead
of
early
may
but
i
fully
doubt
i
would
have
liked
then
bells
makes
some
great
beers
but
i
would
pass
up
this
bells
beer
d
somewhat
drinkable
took
me
a
while
to
polish
this
one
off
because
i
didnt
want
to
drink
it
that
much
not
enough
flavor
d
quite
drinkable
much
better
on
tap
than
in
the
bottle
im
looking
forward
to
having
this
one
again
next
year
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
it
is
april
and
not
december
so
that
may
have
an
influence
in
my
ratings
that
or
i
just
enjoyed
the
beer
i
highly
recommend
but
at
the
regular
price
it
is
spendy
i
got
this
on
clearance
which
was
great
batch
8802
pours
a
dirty
hazy
medium
brown
and
smells
of
fruity
spiciness
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
high
end
of
medium
while
the
flavor
is
decently
soso
its
got
a
wide
range
of
flavors
but
finishes
kind
of
alcoholy
its
an
alright
brew
but
not
the
best
holiday
one
out
there
i
easily
achieve
three
fingers
of
light
tan
caverness
bubbles
that
turn
rocky
as
they
slowly
fade
scattered
blobs
of
lace
are
left
body
has
sharp
tones
of
ruby
and
brown
nose
has
an
invigorating
phelonic
spice
profile
up
front
followed
by
carmel
malt
and
a
splash
of
vanilla
enters
the
mouth
with
a
toasty
feel
and
a
soft
peppery
dusting
now
the
richness
of
the
malts
never
truly
develop
as
i
would
expect
for
the
style
there
is
a
bit
of
a
earthy
woodsy
hop
feel
that
peeks
through
on
the
end
of
the
palate
the
mouthfeel
is
left
with
a
hint
of
the
pale
spices
and
slight
bitter
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
but
overall
falls
short
for
me
eric
very
easy
on
the
eyes
this
one
is
but
i
think
i
was
expecting
mopre
oomph
from
a
christmas
ale
nose
is
rather
light
but
exhibits
some
nice
cereal
grain
brown
sugar
and
hop
notes
everything
comes
together
in
a
fairly
well
balanced
way
but
the
taste
just
isnt
all
im
used
to
with
bells
products
especially
their
oneoff
lines
i
definitely
wasnt
expecting
a
hop
monster
or
anything
i
just
assumed
htere
would
be
a
little
peat
or
smoke
or
just
something
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
that
isnt
there
good
beer
but
i
dont
think
ill
seek
it
out
next
year
unless
they
do
some
fine
tuning
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
feel
is
mediumheavy
on
this
brew
carbonation
is
low
as
not
to
interfere
with
complexities
in
flavor
the
beer
itself
is
slick
on
the
palate
and
goes
down
easy
with
a
real
nice
finish
this
is
one
that
ill
gladly
be
picking
up
again
before
i
took
a
critical
look
at
this
beer
i
had
absolutely
no
intention
of
drinking
it
again
i
felt
as
though
this
was
a
big
let
down
from
bells
this
is
not
so
just
take
a
minute
to
really
dive
into
this
beer
theres
more
there
than
you
think
be
sure
to
drink
it
at
the
correct
serving
temp
as
drinking
it
too
cool
will
kill
its
delicacy
another
great
offering
from
bells
this
is
an
ok
beer
but
i
am
not
sure
if
it
is
a
wee
heavy
give
it
a
try
and
decide
for
yourself
it
might
be
able
to
be
classified
as
a
scotch
ale
but
i
am
not
sure
not
really
a
christmas
ale
in
my
opinion
it
will
be
interesting
to
see
if
it
changes
next
year
the
taste
is
also
quite
citrusy
this
could
be
a
malty
underhopped
pale
ale
it
tastes
unlike
any
scotch
ale
or
wee
heavy
ive
had
sweet
toasted
malt
with
some
alcohol
somewhat
yeasty
with
a
mild
spiciness
to
it
the
finish
is
dry
and
contains
the
majority
of
the
bitterness
some
alcohol
is
present
once
again
and
the
citrus
is
still
there
pours
a
hazy
orangeish
amber
color
with
a
light
tan
head
in
the
aroma
sweet
caramel
maltiness
in
the
taste
sweet
malt
nice
presence
of
caramel
and
a
nice
bitter
all
the
way
through
a
bitter
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
semi
dry
piney
hop
in
the
aftertaste
nice
hop
presence
and
nice
maltiness
medium
body
with
a
good
dose
of
carbonation
very
easy
to
drink
while
i
wouldnt
call
this
a
wee
heavy
personally
it
is
a
good
beer
i
am
not
sure
how
this
beer
ties
in
with
christmas
but
it
is
worth
a
shot
d
bells
christmas
ale
is
an
above
average
beer
but
im
having
a
hard
time
thinking
of
this
as
a
wee
heavy
this
might
be
closer
to
an
american
brown
quite
drinkable
but
the
thinness
hop
forwardness
and
lack
of
malt
presence
render
this
very
different
from
a
wee
heavy
taste
is
mostly
of
pine
needles
and
fresh
grains
hints
of
light
fruits
golden
apples
and
pears
quite
hoppy
upon
further
inspection
but
is
balanced
well
not
getting
much
scotch
ale
characteristics
here
a
pretty
decent
beer
but
i
dont
think
it
is
quite
up
to
par
with
the
rest
of
bells
stellar
lineup
notes
see
first
paragraph
d
overall
this
was
quite
dissappoint
from
a
brewery
that
i
typically
have
a
lot
of
respect
for
you
cant
hit
a
homerun
everytime
but
this
was
more
a
foulball
off
of
their
foot
sorry
bells
but
its
the
truth
the
worst
part
is
that
there
is
nothing
that
i
can
grasp
that
leads
me
to
believe
that
this
is
in
fact
a
wee
heavy
by
far
the
most
dissappointing
christmas
brew
of
this
holiday
season
christmas
ale
should
be
renamed
summer
scottish
ale
that
way
mr
bell
can
give
us
the
real
christmas
ale
next
year
you
know
the
8
0
beast
that
is
packed
with
smoke
and
caramel
malt
that
melts
in
the
mouth
like
warm
toffee
now
that
would
be
a
beer
worth
drooling
over
date
consumed
12
dec
2008
this
holiday
beer
is
still
quite
drinkable
the
holiday
spice
does
not
overpower
this
ale
like
most
do
still
a
decent
beer
but
not
one
of
larry
bells
finest
all
in
all
not
a
horrible
brew
but
not
one
id
seek
out
again
glad
i
tried
it
but
thats
about
it
its
labeled
as
a
scotch
but
between
the
lightness
of
body
lightness
of
aroma
and
flavors
and
the
odd
fruit
and
spice
flavors
creeping
in
it
doesnt
really
fit
the
style
all
that
well
all
in
all
a
fairly
disappointing
brew
that
was
far
from
satisfying
da
brew
appropriate
for
a
cold
night
indoors
or
outdoors
i
suppose
as
far
as
scotch
ales
go
though
it
seemed
perhaps
a
bit
too
small
on
the
flavor
and
aroma
overall
enjoyable
but
lacking
this
is
very
drinkable
and
very
tasty
nice
american
version
of
a
scotch
ale
of
all
the
bells
beer
ive
tried
i
probably
liked
this
one
least
by
far
poured
a
medium
amber
color
with
a
thin
head
that
went
away
quickly
aroma
consisted
of
light
malt
not
a
whole
lot
there
especially
for
a
christmas
ale
tasted
like
malt
and
candy
sugar
a
little
cloying
d
when
i
ordered
it
i
assumed
i
was
getting
a
winter
warmer
but
scotch
ales
are
one
of
my
favorite
styles
so
i
didnt
mind
that
it
wasnt
yet
it
didnt
really
taste
like
any
other
scotch
ales
ive
had
not
sure
what
category
id
have
put
it
in
nevertheless
probably
would
get
it
again
pours
a
cloudy
amber
i
expected
a
little
darker
for
a
scotch
ale
the
smell
was
very
faint
sweet
bready
aroma
and
some
yeast
in
there
as
well
the
taste
was
nothing
like
i
expected
not
the
usual
raisins
and
figs
you
expect
actually
it
wasnt
much
of
anything
the
mouthfeel
was
far
too
light
for
the
style
not
a
good
beer
and
i
will
not
be
buying
again
big
dissapointment
the
drinkability
is
pretty
decent
but
not
something
i
would
look
to
drink
much
of
its
just
not
that
great
of
a
beer
my
favorite
beer
appearance
is
a
reddishgolden
look
and
this
matches
up
perfectly
nice
froth
on
the
poor
not
too
much
lace
left
behind
and
an
excellent
ale
aroma
a
nice
beer
that
tastes
like
a
beer
something
im
always
looking
for
ontap
at
three
squares
appeared
a
very
hazy
amber
with
no
head
the
aroma
and
flavor
are
heavy
on
phenols
and
a
i
get
whiff
of
medicine
at
first
later
more
fruit
like
cherries
comes
out
but
the
medicinal
phenols
rule
frankly
i
had
no
idea
this
was
a
scotch
ale
i
took
it
for
an
odd
belgian
it
was
drinkable
to
the
point
where
it
wasnt
hard
to
finish
but
i
wouldnt
order
another
i
think
this
beer
needs
a
little
more
work
the
aroma
is
hay
like
with
some
earthiness
the
taste
is
also
very
earth
like
and
sweet
it
has
fruity
bitterness
to
it
with
a
little
bit
of
spice
the
aftertaste
has
some
citrus
tones
the
bodys
color
is
cloudy
with
a
copper
color
the
head
is
thin
but
there
is
a
lot
of
lace
to
make
up
for
that
both
the
head
and
lace
are
tan
in
color
i
sloshed
this
beer
as
i
poured
it
and
there
was
still
only
a
minimum
head
overall
i
would
have
to
go
with
decent
d
notes
a
boring
beer
if
youre
going
to
call
a
scotch
ale
a
christmas
ale
you
need
to
come
with
some
robust
flavor
this
doesnt
drinkability
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
perhaps
a
tad
mislabeled
id
consider
this
closer
to
a
bock
than
a
scotch
ale
its
not
high
enough
in
alcohol
or
thick
enough
to
justify
the
label
its
given
not
a
lot
of
complexity
but
a
great
flavor
that
makes
it
worth
picking
up
drinkability
is
soso
if
it
was
christmas
eve
then
maybe
but
not
an
all
day
beer
d
this
is
a
tasty
and
drinkable
scotch
ale
w
plenty
of
flavor
in
respect
to
the
moderate
abv
the
hops
are
pretty
tasty
but
slightly
more
upfront
in
the
flavor
overall
i
find
the
drinkability
of
this
to
good
and
this
is
a
pleasant
christmas
offering
d
i
find
this
to
be
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
it
doesnt
have
a
lot
of
complexity
but
its
nice
for
relaxing
on
a
winters
night
i
also
believe
this
should
be
categorized
as
a
scottish
ale
not
a
scotch
alewee
heavy
its
too
light
for
a
scotch
ale
but
as
long
as
you
know
what
youre
getting
its
a
very
good
beer

red

ale
but
for
the
price
and
expectations
it
falls
short
d
mild
and
drinkable
but
i
really
expected
more
from
bells
kind
of
bland
and
a
bit
disappointing
i
dont
say
this
about
a
bells
beer
but
i
was
not
too
impressed
with
this
one
as
a
scotch
ale
its
subpar
but
its
still
generally
a
decent
beer
i
dont
see
myself
buying
this
again
there
are
just
too
many
other
winter
seasonals
that
i
enjoy
more
quite
a
festive
affair
it
was
what
with
the
smoking
outside
and
the
dances
all
night
the
biscuits
and
bacon
went
really
well
did
you
notice
some
honey
dripped
on
mine
the
taste
was
interestingly
delicious
i
heard
of
better
parties
that
selfsame
eve
though
i
heard
there
was
one
at
the
old
chubby
pub
and
another
down
where
those
dirty

always
hang
out
still

and
the

expect
some

that

and
the

profile
a
little
simple
tweak
this
one
a
little
with
a
solid
fill
of
herbal
hops
the
taste
is
very
balanced
for
a
scottish
ale
there
is
surely
a
tone
of
malt

definitely
not
what
i
was

goes

i
like
this
beer
less
than
the
bumper
crop
with
similar
label
but
i
like
it
well
enough
good
as
a
scottish
but
minimally
smokey
and
not
as
rich
in
feel
and
flavor
as
some
of
the
better
examples
of
the
style
lots
of
malt
on
this
one
obviously
rich
molasses
color
nice
and
heady
tan
and
lasting
pretty
well
it
smells
like
candied
dark
fruit
and
raisins
as
well
as
a
hint
of
maple
to
the
grain
no
hops
at
all
but
they
dont
really
belong
in
the
style
anyhow
i
wish
for
more
body
personally
its
a
little
too
light
and
super
low
abv
for
the
style
but
i
like
the
flavors
a
ton
and
the
carbonation
is
right
where
it
needs
to
be
not
as
complex
as
others
either
maybe
a
good
scottish
style
for
someone
who
doesnt
really
know
what
to
expect
from
the
style
easy
drinking
beer
like
this
is
great
though
making
huge
styles
into
session
beers
is
rad
not
amazing
by
any
stretch
but
i
would
absolutely
buy
this
from
time
to
time
overall
not
the
best
scottish
ale
ever
but
a
very
respectable
one
i
will
not
be
turning
one
of
these
down
at
a
bbq
had
on
tap
has
a
smoky
peaty
nose
bordering
on
dirty
wool
socks
it
pours
brilliant
copper
amber
with
a
thin
film
of
a
head
presents
a
very
clean
and
smooth
palate
with
a
little
smoke
dark
kettle
sugars
and
lightly
toasted
malts
the
palate
is
close
to
an
american
interpretation
of
a
scottish
ale
while
it
has
the
clean
and
smooth
character
of
a
lager
medium
body
and
carbonation
overall
wow
what
an
incredibly
unique
and
delicious
beer
i
love
the
beautiful
balanced
flavors
of
sweet
toasted
malt
and
peat
this
is
a
scotchlovers
scotch
ale
between
this
and
the
slingshot
im
impressed
with
this
brewery
thanks
to
my
brother
for
bringing
them
back
with
him
from
iowa
after
visiting
his
inlaws
very
easy
to
drink
brown
color
o
this
is
one
of
the
more
unique
lagers
ive
tried
and
rest
assured
it
is
in
fact
a
bock
lager
and
not
at
all
a
scottish
ale
the
smoke
and
malt
play
off
one
another
quite
well
i
repeat
this
beer
any
time
i
happen
to
be
near
iowa
city
go
hawkeyes
got
this
tasty
brew
after
dinner
had
a
nice
copper
brown
color
and
slightly
ivory
head
when
poured
into
a
glass
from
a
bottle
not
a
strong
aroma
from
the
bottle
but
picked
up
the
malts
i
enjoyed
the
bock
style
that
tasted
like
it
got
mixed
with
a
rauchbier
smokey
flavor
and
aftertaste
but
not
overpowering
overall
im
glad
i
spotted
a
poster
the
wall
for
this
brewery
good

this
beer
needed

more
hop
to
properly

the
flavors
o
from
the
first
whiff
wooden
nickel
has
an
aroma
unlike
any
other
beer
even
smoke

peated
beers
this

trail
blazes

of

german
lager
with
the
classic
characteristics
of
each
shining
with
equal
importance
very
unique
and
very
nicely
done
overall
an
enjoyable
scottish
ale
i
would
grab
one
or
two
if
i
were
visiting
iowa
a
well
executed
scottish
lager
from
a
small
iowan
brewery
bravo
while
it
could
use
a
bit
more
potency
from
all
the
flavors
at
work
here
its
very
easy
to
drink
and
very
easy
to
enjoy
worth
picking
up
i
know
i
will
be
reaching
for
this
one
again
soon
overall
great
take
on
a
smokey
beer
i
didnt
have
high
expectations
but
this
is
a
good
one
described
as
a
scottish
peated
lager
on
the
bottle
and
it
is
just
that
a
spectacular
version
of
a
slightly
smokey
scottish
ale
only
lagered
with
the
fruitiness
of
the
ale
yeast
gone
the
malts
really
shine
i
may
have
found
my
new
goto
fallwinter
beer
great
stuff
the
flavors
are
all
there
i
just
usually
like
a
bit
more
boldness
in
this
style

me
up
d
will
never

its
almost
like
they

it

for
got
to
condition
and
carbonate
it
i
would
pour
it
down

i
have
no

i
got

im

disappointed
with

theres
just
not

to

on
and
it

an

ale
overall
nothing
but
love
amber
ales
maybe
from
the
tap
or
cask
i
imagine
that
to
be
a
nice
experience
its
a
little
lusher
and
fuller

bottled
its
pretty

poured

the

as
is

did
not

much
in
the
way
of
toast

smoke
nice
with

the
taste
of
this
beer
is
lightly
sweet
up

which
leads
to
a

note
that
lingers
through
to
the
end
i
get
notes
of
raisins
and
a
hint
of
cherries
there
is
a
touch
of
hops
throughout

herbal
notes
in

flavor
and
a
touch

bitterness
that
lingers
just
a
bit
in
the
finish
this
beer
has
a
soft
creamy
mouthfeel
despite
the
slight
prickly
carbonation
there
is
a
definite
toffee
note
here
that
is
quite
nice
and
a
welcome
addition
to
the
flavor
profile
there
is
also
a
light
toasted
malt
note
here
that
seems
to
be
all
that
is
left
of
the
roasted
note
in
the
aroma
the
beer
is
light
enough
to
be
quaffable
but
has
just
enough
heft
to
it
to
remain
quite
interesting
this
is
a
really
nice
beer
that
i
am
definitely
appreciating
right

served
a
bit
too
cold
nice
malty
sweetness
kind
of
a
dry
roasted
barley
finish
this
brew
tasted
pretty
good
on
this
night
nothing
outstanding
pretty
safe
brew
i
enjoyed
this
brew
with
the
italian
stallion
pizza
complimented
my
pizza
well
pours
with
a
burnt
amber
to
brown
color
not
much
head
on
the
beer
but
it
delivers
a
sweet
and
sour
aroma
with
a
bit
of
cherry
pit
the
flavors
is
sweet
and
malty
with
distinct
caramel
malts
up
front
but
otherwise
it
is
uneventful
the
sweetness
does
not
hold
form
through
the
whole
taste
and
the
ending
is
a
bit
jumbled
it
is
light
on
the
palate
compated
to
scottish
ales
and
would
not
be
something
i
would
order
again
becuase
it
is
just
not
that
great
a
medium
bodied
ale
which
is
silky
smooth
this
one
drinks
easy
a
minor
tingle
and
it
is
done
all
aspects
of
this
beer
are
well
done
the
beer
pulled
a
deep
brown
with
a
nice
tan
head
creamy
in
texture
and
the
lace
a
decent
sheet
nice
sweet
malt
nose
caramel
start
was
sweet
and
nicely
malted
with
the
top
moderate
in
feel
finish
was
mild
in
acidity
the
hops
purposeful
in
their
spiciness
dry
and
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
those
addictive
california
ipas
this
is
a
very
malty
beer
it
comes
in
with
a
ton
of
caramel
flavor
nutty
with
some
burnt
character
maybe
even
metallic
in
a
good
way
then
it
gets
really
grainy
personally
i
liked
the
graininess
hop
character
is
mild
just
enough
to
keep
the
malt
from
being
too
sweet
very
smooth
and
drinkable
even
after
the
pitcher
warmed
up
this
was
one
tasty
beer
medium
amber
color
aroma
is
very
neutral
only
slightly
smoke
and
malts
a
medium
bodied
ale
malts
are
nutty
and
slightly
sweet
hops
are
grapefruity
with
a
touch
if
cherry
and
mango
not
a
lot
of
peat
or
smoke
it
tastes
more
like
an
amber
ale
mouthfeel
is
full
and
round
finish
is
clean
and
smooth
aftertaste
is
slightly
bitter
m
y
favorite
at
oggis
this
is
a
good
looking
beer
absolutely
clear
dark
amber
with
a
tan
head
that
thins
out
too
quickly
the
nose
is
a
light
malty
affair
which
repeats
in
the
taste
the
grain
sense
from
the
dark
grains
also
appears
in
the
taste
i
noted
only
very
light
lacing
this
beer
was
quite
smooth
and
drinkable
but
the
alcohol
may
be
somewhat
higher
than
listed
as
it
appeared
to
pack
a
bit
more
punch
than
expected
just
a
bit
sweet
in
the
finish
advertised
as
an
exportstyle
scottish
overall
i
generally
like
atlantics
offerings
but
this
one
just
did
not
hold
up
to
previous
scottish
ales
that
i
have
tried
this
drinks
more
like
an
imperial
porter
and
is
missing
a
lot
of
the
scottish
spices
that
i
associate
with
the
style
for
me
this
is
a
pass
mild
start
but
it
becomes
dark
and
quite
smoky
almost
like
a
rauchbier
smooth
finish
with
a
short
aftertaste
i
detect
some
dark
unsweetened
chocolate
with
some
dark
cherry
deep
in
the
background
the
body
is
a
bit
thin
with
an
elevated
carbonation
level
poured
from
a
bomber
into
a
shaker
pint
the
beer
is
a
dark
ruby
coloring
almost
black
in
the
depths
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
remaining
a
dense
low
profile
while
you
drink
nose
of
rich
caramel
sweetness
with
hints
of
smoke
scotch
notes
and
floral
highlights
flavors
are
rich
and
robust
with
a
scotch
undertone
and
slight
booze
warmth
supporting
a
caramel
highlight
and
smoky
blend
smooth
and
slightly
robust
body
with
a
rich
robust
smoked
aftertaste
rich
sweet
linger
on
a
slick
slightly
cloying
finish
big
beer
but
solid
drinkability
not
a
bad
beer
but
nothing
i
would
seek
out
i
can
think
of
other
scottish
ales
id
rather
drink
over
this
one
o
overall
its
alright
its
a
little
rough
around
the
edges
the
fruity
character
almost
tastes
off
and
doesnt
add
to
the
enjoyment
i
like
that
they
brewed
this
true
to
style
with
heather
nibs
but
not
the
best
example
i
have
had
this
was
a
fun
one
not
only
was
it
a
great
beer
but
we
only
had
one
glass
so
my
wife
and
i
passed
it
back
and
forth
in
front
of
a
campfire
good
camping
beer
poured
a
12
latte
head
of
brief
life
the
body
in
masstone
is
a
deep
burnt
umber
brown
and
held
to
the
light
there
is
zero
light
penetration
smells
of
toasted
malt
the
taste
has
moderately
rich
malt
which
is
followed
by
a
dark
cocoa
finish
kind
of
reminds
me
of
a
lighter
porter
decent
beer
easy
drinking
but
to
me
its
not
a
standout
of
the
scotch
ales
overall
it
was
a
decent
beer
something
i
would
sip
on
perhaps
while
cooking
on
the
grill
or
bbqing
not
my
first
choice
but
if
it
was
there
i
would
have
it
again
do
overall
one
of
the
better
scottish
ales
ive
had
no
bottle
date
but
im
thinking
this
has
a
year
or
two
on
it
not
negatively
affected
though
actually
compliments
it
i
feel
thanks
mikeyv35
overall
a
nice
little
or
big
as
it
werescottish
ale
and
pleasant
enough
to
sip
on
just
a
touch
to
sweet
for
me
dr
a
big
beer
filling
plently
of
flavor
but
kind
of
muddled
its
good
but
the
flavors
are
so
blended
that
i
cant
sort
it
out
it
will
not
be
a
problem
to
finish
off
the
bomber
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
nice
deep
color
brownish
red
color
the
head
was
pretty
nice
the
smell
is
floral
and
earthy
there
is
ani
e
hop
aroma
too
the
taste
of
the
beer
had
a
good
floral
flavor
to
it
with
some
spicy
flavors
the
mouthfeel
is
very
nice
plenty
of
carbonation
and
soft
at
the
same
time
overall
this
beer
is
way
bed
tree
than
the
dub
el
in
my
opinion
nicely
done
o
awesome
scottish
ale
ill
definitely
get
this
again
for
a
larger
tasting
of
this
style
overall
a
decent
brew
i
would
have
this
again
beer
is
thinner
than
expected
and
has
this
peaty
flavor
to
it
smoky
on
the
finish
but
it
is
not
overpowering
not
the
best
beer
ive
ever
had
but
i
see
why
it
is
so
highly
rated
it
is
a
sipper
overall
not
bad
well
balanced
between
the
malt
and
the
smoke
not
very
complex
but
id
have
it
again
pours
a
clear
copperbrown
color
with
an
average
offwhite
head
and
some
sparse
spotty
lacing
on
the
way
down
the
nose
brings
through
a
moderate
amount
of
bready
malt
along
with
some
light
caramel
and
a
bit
of
a
nutty
character
the
flavor
adds
some
light
smoke
which
works
well
in
tandem
with
a
bit
of
roast
and
toast
mild
character
comes
from
the
heather
tips
which
dry
out
the
finish
medium
body
and
some
fizzy
carbonation
good
smoke
element
in
the
finish
as
well
nice
beer
overall
this
is
an
interesting
good
smooth
interpretation
of
a
scottish
ale
not
mind
blowing
just
solid
worth
a
go
because
of
the
fair
price
tag
but
i
dont
think
this
is
the
best
example
of
the
style
as
it
currently
rates
on
this
website
poured
into
a
duvel
tulip
glass
has
a
deep
mahogany
wood
look
with
a
nice
reddish
hue
when
held
up
to
the
light
comes
with
a
1
finger
eggshell
head
that
slowly
dissolved
to
a
nice
ever
present
lace
lots
of
great
aroma
on
this
one
standard
toffee
caramel
dark
malts
present
like
in
all
scotch
ales
but
what
makes
this
unique
is
the
light
floral
component
that
is
definitely
present
on
tasting
the
floralheather
component
was
even
more
pronounced
very
unique
compared
to
other
scotch
ales
ive
sampled
it
makes
the
beer
extremely
drinkable
and
it
tastes
lighter
than
other
scotch
ales
ive
tried
in
fact
i
dont
really
pick
up
on
the
alcohol
at
all
which
is
somewhat
surprising
considering
it
comes
in
just
shy
of
8
abv
nice
hint
of
smokepeat
which
is
something
i
want
in
my
scotch
ales
as
well
this
stuff
is
rock
solid
and
i
will
definitely
seek
it
out
again
if
you
like
the
style
and
want
to
try
something
a
little
different
give
it
a
try
overall
not
bad
but
not
great
either
some
nice
malty
flavors
a
touch
of
the
herbal
hops
and
heather
give
it
a
strange
mix
nothing
too
off
of
it
but
could
have
used
a
bit
more
carbonation
otherwise
not
bad
this
is
a
drinkable
scott
and
the
sweet
roast
makes
easy
to
drink
this
is
mellow
but
complex
at
the
same
time
creamy
with
low
carbonation
one
of
the
more
drinkable
scottish
ales
ive
had
the
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
thick
frothy
tan
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
solid
burnt
toffee
and
smoked
malt
scent
along
with
hints
of
heather
and
a
dry
finish
the
taste
is
decent
it
has
a
malty
flavor
that
boasts
of
crystal
and
smoked
malts
it
goes
down
slow
and
rich
with
some
light
esters
and
a
bone
dry
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
an
above
average
scottish
ale
its
flavorful
but
its
definitely
not
a
strong
recreation
of
this
style
also
seems
to
go
well

food

could

that
someone
put
black
licorice
in
the

this

by
a

little
in
the
way
of

or

black
currants
or
cranberries
seem
to
be
the
first
noticeable
ingredients
in
the
aroma
followed
by
vaguely
smoked
malts
the
mouthfeel
tends
to
be
oily
and
of
medium

the
taste
has
a
kind
of
black
licorice
element
to
it
with
heather
tips
light

and
a
very

hopped
ending
it
is
easy
to
drink
a
thick
brown
black
color
with
a
healthy
oatmeal
colored
head
and
decent
lacing
the
aroma
is
an
odd
swampy
malt
sort
of
a
seaweed
deal
the
flavor
is
similar
with
a
nice
herbal
chocolate
hop
and
sweet
red
wine
the
odd
herbal
theme
dominates
with

this
bottle
was
nowhere
near
as
good
as
the
first
which
was
amazing
i
guess
a
little
quality
control
is
in
order
or
maybe
the
bottle
was
old
but
this
should
age
well
flavor
and
mouthfeel
was
thin
like
i
was
drinking
a
totally
different
beer
not
saying
it
was
bad
but
it
didnt
blow
me
away
like
the
first
one
will
give
this
another
try
but
my
local
beer
place
had
some
of
these
in
closeout
so
maybe
its
retired
oh
well
there
is
always
old
chubb
palate
was
creamy
with
a
subdued
carbonation
that
was
just
crisp
enough
to
go
perfectly
with
the
surprisingly
excellent
barbecue
served
at
atlantics
own
brewpub
marvelous
job
out
of
a
bomber
picked
up
at
the
brewery
this
ale
was
a
deep
nearly
opaque
brown
color
with
onefinger
of
khaki
head
the
aroma
was
of
roasted
malt
sweet
malt
and
peat
smoke
the
flavors
were
a
little
unusual
i
kept
thinking
good
bbq
sauce
roasted
malt
peat
smoke
caramel
malt
and
a
good
hoppy
bitterness
that
nipped
the
very
end
slightly
acidic
but
not
unpleasantly
so
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
the
carbonation
perfect
the

mediumfull
a
good
beer
but
i
bet
it
would
make
an
even
better
marinade

from

its
an
interesting
delicious

interpretation
of
a
scottish

that
is
oh
so
easy
to
drink
flavor
is
sweet
and
slightly
smokey

flavors

speak
of

roasty
taste
is
initially
sweet
with
a
sharper
bite
on

finish
a
little
oily
on

on

22oz

at

in
portland
d
pretty
good
beer
wouldnt
mind
having
it
again
drinkability
this
was
extremely
eay
to
quaff
and
would
be
a
nice
session
beer
despite
the
slightly
higher
alcohol
levels
d
better
then
average
drinkability
with
a
nice
mineral
touch
wow
that
is
a
great
tasting
beer
it
has
a
nice
subtle
smokey
taste
that
i
really
like
it
cuts
the
sweetness
very
well
the
alcohol
although
noticeable
as
a
smell
is
not
overly
present
in
the
taste
it
has
some
nuttiness
to
it
and
a
very
nice
finish
i
really
like
this
one
another
solid
beer
from
atlantic
the
alcohol
in
the
aroma
is
missing
in
the
taste
very
smooth
drinkable
beer
heavy
on
the
malt
flavors
as
par
for
the
style
caramel
with
a
bit
of
earthy
spiciness
in
the
finish
excellent
mouthfeel
medium
bodied
and
just
chewy
enough
with
out
being
too
thick
i
would
love
to
have
this
one
again
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
kind
of
filling
nice
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
good
beer
to
relax
with
and
drink
slowly
but
after
one
bomber
i
think
id
be
done
not
too
bad
i
held
on
to
this
for
a
while
and
i
dont
think
it
was
to
its
detriment
at
all
it
just
cant
match
up
to
some
of
the
authentic
examples
from
across
the
pond
not
a
fan
of
strong
scottish
ales
but
this
is
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
had
a
smoother
feel
would
have
aided
this
beer
i
think
maybe
remove
some
of
the
alcohol
tones
i
dont
find
this
to
be
all
that
exciting
and
its
rather
straightforward
and
not
very
complex
still
it
is
tasty
and
is
a
beer
id
have
again
if
i
came
across
it
unlike
other
scottish
ales
ive
had
this
one
is
less
sweet
amazingly
flavorful
and
drinks
much
lighter
than
it
is
if
you
get
a
chance
to
try
one
definitely
go
for
it
very
drinkable
about
20
ounces
to
go
too
the
finish
leaves
a
smoky
backwoods
taste
that
makes
you
feel
like
your
sitting
next
to
a
fire
without
being
overwelming
a
must
try
for
scottish
ale
fans
has
a
nice
big
body
with
very
little
carbonation
the
alcohol
cannot
be
detected
a
small
bit
sweet
but
the
finish
dries
out
the
palate
a
bit
very
easy
to
drink
for
a
big
beer
i
wish
i
had
a
steady
supply
of
this

a

very
enjoyable
overall
its
alot
like
an
american

not
bad
not
on

but
i
forgive
i
would
be
curious
to
know
the

really
offer

the

on
the

side
of
medium

the
carbonation
is
low
but
well
incorporated
this
is
a
very
easy
to

beer
i
enjoyed
the
beer
from
start
to
finish
i
would
gladly
drink
this
beer
again
clear
dark
brown
beer
topped
by
a
bit
of
coarse
foam
that
produced
a
little
lace
the
aroma
was
mostly
malty
nutty
and
floral
but
there
was
also
a
bit
of
cola
nut
and
a
faint
hint
of
smoke
as
well
mild
flavour
plenty
of

and

with

decent

this
stuff
is
pretty
good
i
particularly
liked
the
combination
of
malts
thanks
for
sharing
northyorksammy
the
beer
was
picked
up
in
22
oz
brown
bomber
with
a
scottish
tartan
label
background
framing
the
image
of
a
scotsman
shepherding
in
a
highland
pasture
the
beer
poured
coca
cola
brown
in
color
with
a
similar
evaporating
fizz
the
head
was
nonexistent
and
the
beer
was
also
quite
still
after
the
first
few
seconds
of
activity
the
aroma
was
malty
and
smoky
and
smelled
like
coffee
dark
chocolate
and
sawdust
the
taste
was
mellow
and
the
texture
silky
the
spicy
hops
or
was
it
heather
were
more
noticeable
than
typical
and
a
peat
smoke
dryness
was
persistent
in
the
aftertaste
almost
a
porter
this
scottish
ale
was
quite
different
than
others
that
i
had
tasted
before
this
was
much
less
fruity
and
more
bitter
good
on
its
own
merits
i
suppose
big
white
bubbly
head
very
brown
alcohol
aroma
good
mouhfeel
with
biscuit
and
graininess
herbal
element
from
heather
scotch
and
malty
and
faint
smoke
a
tad
of
sourness
at
end
crossstyle
and
understated
achievement
better
than
it
smells
like
an
aged
ale
drinkability
is
good
very
tasty
and
balanced
beer
drinkability
is
okay
this
one
is
pretty
easy
to
put
down
but
doesnt
offer
much
to
draw
me
back
in
for
another
bottle
this
offering
from
atlantic
brewing
tempted
me
from
the
moment
i
saw
it
i
love
atlantic
brewing
co
and
now
there
presence
in
ma
is
growing
this
scottish
ale
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
tan
head
the
aroma
is
malty
caramel
nutty
fruit
raisins
earthy
floural
hops
heather
flowers
honey
a
very
complex
aroma
the
taste
is
smokey
chocolate
tangy
a
bit
bitter
with
a
herbal
presence
but
nicely
mouthfeel
on
the
palate
the
finsh
is
fruity
sweet
with
a
little
acidic
feel
on
the
back
end
of
the
palate
i
paired
this
beer
with
turkey
dinner
and
all
the
trimming
and
it
was
a
great
match
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
a
14
light
brown
head
over
the
clear
dark
burgundy
brew
aroma
is
dominated
by
smoky
maltiness
with
flowery
notes
taste
follows
right
along
with
the
nose
exactly
as
predicted
mouthfeel
is
super
smooth
and
soft
over
the
tongue
tremendously
drinkable
my
mouth
tells
me
this
aint
no
7
but
my
head
will
probably
verify
the
abv
later
excellent
brew
up
until
then
though
pretty
tasty
a
clean
dark
brown
beer
with
deep
mahogony
highlights
has
a
nice
creamy
light
brown
head
with
some
nice
lacing
the
first
aroma
to
hit
you
as
you
pour
is
a
tangable
but
sweet
smoky
character
hints
of
nuts
and
some
light
dried
fruit
dance
in
the
background
there
is
an
initial
burst
of
malty
sweetness
at
the
start
of
the
taste
followed
quickly
by
a
quick
ghost
of
smokiness
and
again
the
nutlike
hints
mixed
with
some
dried
fruit
notes
the
smokiness
returns
in
the
somwhat
dry
finish
the
alcohol
does
not
real
make
it
self
known
until
the
end
of
the
glass
so
a
wee
heavy
i
think
not
a
delicious
scottish
style
ale
yes
an
interesting
take
on
the
genre
im
predispositioned
to
scottish
scotch
ales
and
i
enjoyed
this
one
it
does
a
good
job
hiding
the
almost
8
abv
so
be
careful
of
the
22ozs
atlantic
did
a
nice
job
walking
the
line
between
scottish
ale
wee
heavy
those
of
you
looking
for
a
nice
autumnal
brew
or
an
interesting
take
on
the
genre
should
check
it
out
could
see
this
going
great
with
a
cheese
soup
as
well
well
done
atlantic
ive
tried
many
atlantic
offerings
with
enjoyable
results
this
is
no
exception
it
was
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
thim
tan
head
it
had
a
roasted
quite
malt
aroma
as
well
as
some
floralgrassy
hints
good
hoppy
taste
a
little
sweet
i
thought
i
could
taste
a
little
honey
fairly
substantial
a
beer
to
savor
well
my
2nd
beer
from
atlantic
brewing
up
in
bah
habbah
neat
offering
and
the
1st
time
ive
seen
this
pours
nearly
black
in
color
smell
of
sweet
malt
taste
is
of
malt
roasted
almost
burnt
malt
and
some
grassy
flavored
hops
like
mown
lawn
mouthfeel
is
not
thin
very
nice
drinkability
one
to
savor
i
think
a
lot
of
people
would
think
this
is
some
kind
of
stout
but
its
a
scottish
ale
it
says
that
its
hopped
with
heather
i
cant
taste
it
but
its
still
a
really
nice
beer
appears
a
dark
reddish
hue
with
decent
sized
tan
head
some
rings
of
lacing
were
left
as
this
was
consumed
sweet
malty
aroma
with
some
fruits
and
caramel
lighter
earthy
notes
mingled
about
sweet
fruit
blended
with
a
bit
of
dark
chocolate
started
off
the
flavor
light
smoky
and
earthy
herbal
notes
mixed
in
well
pretty
full
and
interesting
taste
easy
drinking
stuff
that
is
smooth
going
down
and
the
last
sip
is
as
tasty
as
the
first
damn
you
macfoochie
overall
a
decent
scottish
ale
that
is
a
good
sipping
beer
nothing
outstanding
here
pours
a
deep
rich
brown
with
ruby
highlights
topped
by
a
small
khaki
head
that
vanishes
almost
instantly
aroma
of
roasted
caramel
malt
some
molasses
and
a
hint
of
piny
hops
palate
is
wellbalanced
and
complex
a
backbone
of
sweet
roasted
caramel
malt
accented
by
slightly
spicy
and
piny
hops
with
an
underlying
fruity
sweetness
the
alcohol
provides
a
nice
warming
finish
body
is
smooth
but
not
too
rich
definitely
a
good
scottish
ale
and
one
of
the
best
offerings
from
atlantic
finishes
quick
with
toasted
nuts
on
chocolate
my
first
impression
about
this
ale
was
that
it
would
be
like
most
scottish
ales
with
a
relatively
easy
drinkability
but
lacking
in
the
over
taste
and
mouthfeel
this
was
not
the
case
atlantic
has
brought
a
great
beer
to
my
table
with
a
wonderfully
dark
almost
pitchblack
colouration
and
a
exceptional
aroma
of
beautifully
balanced
hops
there
was
no
malt
aroma
or
flavouring
which
is
a
plus
the
abv
is
certainly
not
a
factor
and
is
not
noticed
this
ale
has
a
wonderfully
smooth
feel
and
very
easy
drinkability
overall
i
would
most
certainly
rate
this
beer
as
an
a
many
thanks
to

down
to
just
a

very
clear

with

touches
and
some
flitting
action
light
peat
smokiness
on
nose
with
a
mossy
presence
and
light

note
which
id
take
a
stab
at
as
being
the

great
smoke
on

right
away
malt
finagles
its
way
through
quite
nicely
with

notes
wellbalanced
ale
with
just
the
right
amount
of
burn
dirty
earthy
aromas
of
peat
and
grape

alcohol
is
noticeable
but
seems
to
fit
in
nicely
with
the
colalike
caramel
notes
that
assert
themselves
smooth
and
at
times
almost
oily
this
has
a
chewy
malt
flavor
with
a
light
alcohol
astringency
that
seems
to
fade
as
the
beer
sits
or
as
i
adjust
to
it
either
way
the
beer
tastes
and
feels
quite
natural
the
finish
isnt
quite
as
distinct
or
abrupt
as
some
beers
its
much
more
cohesive
and
wellrounded
presenting
a
solid
malt
flavor
throughout
and
somehow
just
feeling
balanced
in
the
end
must
be
the
heather
top
notch
stuff
drinkability
is
very
solid
heather
is
an
acquired
taste
and
sometimes
flat
out
does
not
work
however
with
this
beer
the
combination
and
transitions
are
excpetionally
well
done
very
nice
brew
wyll
best
scottish
ale
i
ever
had
good
session
brew
with
a
lighter
mouthfeel
and
sweetness
enjoyed
this
winter
ale
not
what
i
expected
but
wonderful
nonetheless
scotch
ale
taste
not
my
thing
lackluster
not
outright
bad
but
disappointing
overall
i
thought
this
was
an
ok
beer
and
i
thought
it
was
an
average
example
of
the
style
it
really
didnt
seem
to
scotch
ale
like
it
reminded
more
of
an
average
english
ale
especially
with
that
fruity
english
ale
yeast
flavor
sticking
out
the
most
this
beer
had
ok
drinkability
it
was
smooth
not
too
crisp
not
too
filling
but
the
taste
didnt
do
the
best
job
at
holding
my
attention
and
one
would
be
enough
for
me
the
flavors
doesnt
want
to
me
make
drink
another
one
what
i
like
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
appearance
it
was
a
pretty
nice
looking
beer
what
i
like
the
least
about
this
beer
was
the
balance
i
wish
the
caramel
malts
showed
up
more
and
the
fruity
yeast
showed
up
less
i
wouldnt
buy
this
beer
again
but
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
it
just
isnt
something
that
im
that
into
i
cant
say
i
would
recommend
this
beer
it
doesnt
have
any
aspect
that
makes
it
stand
out
all
in
all
i
wasnt
impressed
with
this
beer
and
in
the
end
i
wanted
better
balance
from
it
its
on
the
lower
end
for
this
brewery
and
its
in
the
middle
for
the
style
i
appreciate
the
effort
but
this
one
just
isnt
for
me
better
luck
next
time
couldnt
differentiate
from
any
other
middle
of
the
road
winter
ales
pours
copper
with
ruby
hues
and
a
light
head
of
foam
that
fell
pretty
fast
and
left
a
thin
ring
very
clear
nose
is
malty
and
fruity
and
with
no
big
hop
scents
a
little
tempting
sweetness
from
alcohol
on
that
nose
like
sticky
brown
bread
caramel
earth
and
dark
fruits
taste
is
malty
and
sweet
dry
and
with
a
bit
of
spice
on
the
finish
no
alcohol
on
the
palate
mouthfee
lis
easy
going
medium
this
drinks
so
well
the
breadiness
the
carbonation
and
the
dryness
are
a
delight
alongside
the
fruitiness
and
the
rich
malt
and
caramel
its
like
a
nice
sweet
bread
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
nothing
exciting
the
beer
has
a
nice
balance
between
malt
and
hops
and
sweetness
but
its
pretty
forgettable
once
finished
as
a
brooklyn
brewery
fan
im
glad
i
tried
it
but
i
probably
wont
get
it
again
as
there
are
much
better
brooklyn
beers
out
there
as
much
better
winter
beers
out
there
as
well
that
being
said
id
certainly
not
turn
this
beer
down
if
offered
and
would
certainly
enjoy
it
i
was
excited
to
try
a
scottish
ale
from
brooklyn
brewery
but
this
left
me
disappointed
this
is
a
light
bland
ale
without
the
bite
i
expect
from
this
style
of
beer
refreshing
and
clean

brooklyn

has
a

smell
it
is
full
of
flavors
and

you
pick
up

in
the

of
this

the
taste

is

overpowering
in
this
brew
brooklyn
brewery
did
a
nice
job
with
this
brew
i
would
get
buy
this
brew
again
overall
im
giving
this
brew
a
4
out
of
5
drain
pour
body
and
color
of
a
soda
with
sickeningly
sweet
nose
and
flavor
honestly
i
could
barely
stomach
a
couple
of
ounces
a
pretty
big
disappointment
from
the
normally
solid
brewery
a
little
cloying
and
the
fruity
character
doesnt
jive
bubblegum
esters
emerge
tastes
medicinal
o
ok
a
little
blah
skunk
beer
compared
to
my
favorite
belhaven
or
grants
draught
bubba
gump
nyc
this
one
poured
a
crystal
clear
amber
color
there
was
a
very
small
head
that
didnt
linger
long
or
leave
much
lacing
some
spiciness
and
malts
but
no
real
sweetness
to
the
aroma
decent
enough
taste
somewhat
dry
malts
spices
pretty
smooth
not
bad
pretty
average
at
best
just
not
the
biggest
fan
respectable
but
not
enjoyable
after
slowly
drinking
it
i
taste
the
overused
winter
taste
notes
that
bore
me
very
even
winter
ale
very
enjoyable
overall
this
is
a
plain
but
delicious
beer
to
have
on
a
cold
winter
day
like
today
got
a
single
bottle
of
this
from
discount
drinks
in
farmington
hills
pours
a
clear
rubyamber
color
with
a
short
tan
head
that
dissipates
fast
medium
amounts
of
lace
smells
of
caramel
oak
honey
yeast
whiskey
wood
tastes
relatively
sweet
a
bit
bitter
tinges
of
spice
wood
booze
dry
medium
bodied
and
has
ample
amounts
of
carbonation
overall
this
was
pretty
good
ive
always
been
a
fan
of
brooklyn
brewing
but
i
only
liked
this
one
i
didnt
love
it
nearly
tasteless
with
a
strong
presence
of
malt
although
brooklyn
has
had
some
hits
most
of
their
product
is
mired
in
mediocrity
frankly
ive
never
been
able
to
understand
the
following
i
could
have
picked
up
some
rare
bottles
at
what
approached
30
for
a
750cc
but
with
their
history
in
mind
it
just
didnt
sound
like
a
good
idea
a
few
more
beers
like
this
one
and
ill
be
done
with
them
for
good
brown
but
with
deep
rubygarnet
hues
when
held
up
to
the
light
cream
colored
head
that
retains
decently
deep
caramel
hint
of
raisins

of

bitterness
in

overall
a
nice
example
of
the
style
drinkable
with
a
nice
malt
presence
my
rating
is
based
on
its
representation
of
the
genre
and
drinkability
combined
overall
its
one
of
my
favorite
winter
beers
and
well
worth
a
try
a
tasty
enough
brew
lots
of
satisfyingly
hearty
sweet
bits
and
none
too
complicated
for
warding
off
the
lingering
eponymous
for
now
seasonal
melancholy
comments
thank
you
garrett
oliver
brooklyns
winter
ale
is
a
wonderful
example
of
scottish
ale
the
web
says
this
beer
is
6
0
abv
however
my
bottle
says
6
1
abv
the
nominal
strength
is
half
a
percent
lower
than
guidelines
for
a
wee
heavy
but
1
abv
more
than
an
80
scottish
export
all
things
said
winter
ale
taste
like
a
wee
heavy
most
importantly
it
avoids
the
two
most
common
failings
of
american
craftbrewed
beer
first
its
not
too
hoppy
most
american
craftbrewers
especially
those
on
the
west
coast
use
far
too
many
hops
even
in
beer
styles
in
which
it
would
be
inappropriate
second
oliver
doesnt
use
whisky
malt
in
this
beer
almost
every
other
example
of
american
craftbrewerys
scottish
ale
uses
this
peat
smoked
whisky
malt
this
is
simply
inappropriate
for
a
true
scottish
ale
it
is
scottish
ale
not
scotch
whisky
i
cant
think
of
a
better
example
of
an
american
craftbrewed
scottish
ale
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
but
brooklyn
does
a
good
enough
job
with
this
one
i
wouldnt
want
more
than
1
or
2
of
these
though
and
ideally
would
pair
it
with
food
the
yeast
has
certainly
made
its
mark
on
this
brew
bit
of
a
butter
bomb
the
core
maltiness
is
secondary
if
by
chance
i
have
this
one
again
perhaps
it
would
go
better
paired
with
a
hearty
stew
or
a
sharp
cheese
to
contrast
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
the
availability
is
nice
but
its
nothing
outstanding
the
price
could
come
down
a
tad
goddamn
this
is
good
not
that
i
should
be
surprised
brooklyn
is
usually
pretty
quality
in
whatever
they
do
just
dont
overlook
this
if
youre
generally
geared
toward
bigger
beers
like
i
am
because
this
has
plenty
of
flavor
and
pizazz
its
definitely
worthy
and
im
glad
i
bought
a
6pack
up
to
hearty
stews
and
meats
this
beer
is
both
pleasant
and
warming
for
those
chilly
winter
nights
the
simplicity
of
it
makes
it
appealing
poured
a
very
nice
deep
brown
with
very
nice
head
and
good
lacing
throughout
nice
deep
malty
scent
very
heady
and
thick
with
some
nice
earthiness
in
the
nose
good
flavors
a
very
thick
malty
flavor
with
a
bit
of
biscuit
and
a
bit
of
roastiness
in
it
went
down
quite
well
very
smooth
o
this
is
good
to
me
and
for
its
style
a
decent
enough
beer
from
brooklyn
but
not
one
id
be
desparately
seeking
again
beer
is
medium
in
body
not
as
sweet
as
the
aroma
would
imply
it
is
a
little
bitter
dry
on
the
finish
oddly
peaty
on
the
midpalate
decent
i
like
it
probably
not
a
repeat
though
overall
a
beer
worth
trying
just
didnt
blow
me
away
do
drinkability
is
moderately
high
to
be
honest
i
didnt
read
up
on
this
beer
before
drinking
it
and
was
expecting
another
runofthemill
overly
spiced
winter
warmer
what
i
get
instead
is
one
of
the
best
domestic
readilyavailable
scottish
ales
ive
tasted
to
date
its
malty
yet
somewhat
balanced
and
brings
to
the
table
a
wonderful
flavor
rjt
pint
glass
reddish
body
lots
of
bubbles
not
much
head
big
smokey
nose
with
a
hint
of
sweetness
some
olive
oil
really
wet
and
crispy
with
some
bright
cherry
a
little
fruity
sourness
toward
the
end
like
a
strawberry
would
give
a
little
hop
bite
carbonation
scratches
the
palate
gently
and
the
burnt
flavor
just
backing
it
all
up
o
a
decent
scotch
id
prefer
more
hops
and
spices
and
bitterness
to
level
this
one
out
12oz
of
this
was
almost
too
much
had
this
beer
from
the
12oz
bottle
served
cool
dark
amber
color
and
a
nice
creamy
head
smell
lightly
smoke
peat
metallic
and
woody
taste
is
not
what
i
expected
no
spice
the
combination
of
malts
gives
an
earthy
quality
to
this
thick
on
the
tongue
and
drinkable
but
not
something
i
would
really
seek
out
as
a
winter
pick
might
want
to
save
this
as
a
food
beer
with
scottish
fare
not
as
a
winter
warmer
like
beer
overall
what
we
found
most
enjoyable
about
this
brew
was
the
fruity
qualities
to
the
flavoring
this
beer
was
great
for
the
season
but
less
so
for
the
style
a
scottish
ale
should
be
darker
with
more
booze
and
caramel
and
to
this
point
we
were
disappointed
the
grain
also
had
an
interesting
sour
bite
that
we
would
have
liked
to
see
elaborated
on
or
at
least
more
cleanly
integrated
with
the
rest
of
the
flavoring
for
more
overall
pretty
good
nothing
crazy
but
certainly
decent
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
its
a
great
wintertime
beer
that
would
be
awesome
on
a
cold
night
i
was
expecting
a
little
heavier
on
the
body
but
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
at
how
thin
and
easy
to
drink
it
was
this
is
a
beer
id
come
back
to
again
in
the
right
circumstances
taste
is
sweet
and
spicy
with
upfront
tones
of
peat
malts
earthy
fruity
leathery
a
solid
and
tasty
winter
ale
from
a
brewery
who
does
most
everything
right
poured
a
1
beige
velvet
head
with
decent
retention
the
body
is
burnt
umber
brown
in
masstone
but
held
to
the
light
its
a
clear
dark
amber
the
smell
is
a
touch
of
malt
taste
also
has
some
malt
and
i
might
have
guessed
spicing
but
from
the
profile
i
know
thats
not
the
case
its
just
the
creaminess
and
richness
of
the
scottish
style
medium
length
finish
decent
beer
highly
recommended
some
astringency
and
syrupy
maple
sweetness
lingering
aftertaste
of
toasted
bread
and
dried
fruit
it
has
the
odd
twang
of
oxidation
somehow
medium
bodied
and
pretty
sweet
at
first
the
astringency
and
odd
fruity
tanginess
are
somewhat
off
putting
wouldnt
try
this
again
i
dont
care
much
for
the
style
but
this
wasnt
bad
there
was
a
bit
of
rye
in
the
nose
but
never
in
the
taste
and
it
was
somewhat
less
scottish
than
i
expected
which
was
a
welcome
surprise
d
overall
very
nice
wasnt
sure
of
the
style
when
i
ordered
it
but
it
very
quickly
proved
itself
to
be
a
scottish
nice
beer
presentation
packaged
in
a
standard
twelveounce
brown
glass
long
neck
bottle
with
a
pryoff
crown
served
in
a
standard
pilsener
glass
pours
deep
cherry
brown
with
white
foam
that
settles
down
to
18
inch
malty
smell
chocolate
notes
and
caramel
sweet
malty
taste
smooth
light
carbonation
full
rich
flavor
easy
winter
drinker
flavorful
overall
it
is
a
great
example
of
a
mild
scotch
ale
this
is
disappointing
usually
brooklyn
can
be
counted
on
to
feature
some
solid
beers
but
this
is
underwhelming
ill
avoid
this
in
the
future
nothing
special
here
the
last
few
beers
ive
had
from
brooklyn
have
been
yawners
i
wont
give
up
on
them
but
it
may
take
soimething
really
interesting
to
make
try
them
any
time
soon
o
overall
a
decent
beer
not
the
best
example
of
a
scottish
ale
but
its
a
tasty
easy
drinker
o
i
cant
pick
a
winner
here
both
descent
scottish
ales
poured
a
seasonal
red
color
with
zero
head
dont
know
if
time
passed
between
the
pour
and
the
serve
but
absolutely
no
head
not
flat
just
awkward
in
the
glass
i
wont
hold
it
against
this
beer
too
heavily
because
im
sure
the
bottled
version
is
more
lively
smells
a
bit
sweet
and
ambery
with
a
faint
holiday
spice
thing
going
on
in
the
finish
not
spicy
but
spiced
cinnamon
is
definitely
there
in
spirit
at
least
mouthfeel
is
fuller
bodied
which
is
nice
here
worked
well
with
barbeque
but
would
also
certainly
excell
after
dinner
with
or
as
desert
not
my
favorite
brooklyn
beer
but
it
has
a
role
d
overall
not
a
bad
beer
its
nothing
i
would
seek
out
but
it
could
hit
the
spot
on
a
chilly
evening
overall
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
nothing
groundbreaking
but
a
tasty
little
brew
and
one
of
their
best
seasonals
i
will
definitely
be
picking
up
more
of
this
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
nothing
out
of
this
world
but
it
is
solid
lots
of
carbonation
here
with
curtins
of
small
thin
bubbles
streaming
from
the
bottom
of
my
glass
very
enjoyable
to
look
at
color
is
nice
too
with
the
beer
having
a
rich
chestnut
brown
color
thats
quite
clear
aroma
is
malty
with
some
toffee
taste
is
good
it
has
a
rich
malt
flavor
with
a
good
dose
of
toffee
like
in
the
nose
theres
a
little
bit
of
roasted
malt
in
there
too
a
medium
weight
beer
witha
smooth
and
soft
texture
a
good
well
made
beer
thats
a
fine
example
of
the
style
o
i
find
this
beer
to
be
pretty
decent
this
would
make
a
perfect
session
beer
and
it
was
rather
cheap
overall
this
is
an
above
average
beer
overall
nothing
that
make
me
look
forward
to
this
seasonal
release
every
year
but
still
a
good
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
beer
fans
of
scotch
ales
will
enjoy
this
one
for
sure
this
is
a
nice
beer
a
solid
winter
ale
high
on
drink
ability
overall
a
pretty
good
take
on
a
scottish
ale
nice
use
of
malts
overall
its
nice
but
id
go
with
an
avalanch
winter
beer
over
this
one
its
starting
to
feel
a
touch
like
winter
out
there
so
might
as
well
embrace
the
season
with
the
appropriate
beer
eh
it
pours
a
slightly
hazy
tawnyrusset
topped
by
a
relatively
shortlived
finger
of
dusty
tancream
foam
the
nose
comprises
caramel
mandarin
orange
syrup
light
spruce
very
light
honey
and
a
particularly
small
twinge
of
laffy
taffystyle
strawberry
hidden
in
the
background
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
a
touch
of
graham
cracker
to
round
things
out
i
may
or
may
not
detect
a
pinch
or
two
of
nutmeg
and
brown
sugar
as
well
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
very
lightly
chewy
feel
overall
a
pretty
nice
beer
nothing
exceptional
but
a
nice
winter
quaff
if
youre
in
the
market
for
such
a
thing
notes
not
complex
but
it
us
easy
drinking
and
satisfying
not
much
else
to
say
good
winter
seasonal
beer
nothing
too
impressive
but
very
drinkable
easy
drinking
with
mild
flavors
but
not
the
best
scotch
ale
ive
had
nor
is
it
a
beer
that
necessarily
reminds
me
of
winter
when
it
comes
to
winter
scotch
ales
ill
take
the
hibernator
by
long
trail
any
day
not
saying
this
is
a
bad
beer
but
for
a
seasonal
release
not
something
im
gonna
search
out
overall
an
average
scotch
ale
worth
the
tick
o
this
isnt
complex
and
is
rather
malty
and
simple
but
i
like
it
its
a
nice
warming
beer
for
the
late
fallwinter
clear
auburn
body
nice
off
white
head
lace
is
moderate
smell
is
pretty
nice
malty
and
clean
flavor
is
simple
but
good
nice
maltiness
with
a
little
bit
of
candy
like
sweetnes
as
well
goes
down
pretty
easy
with
a
medium
body
and
light
to
moderate
carbonation
pleasing
beverage
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
tulip
glass
best
by
apr
12
this
pours
a
brownish
red
color
with
a
decent
tan
head
which
dissipates
down
to
a
thin
layer
the
smells
are
mostly
of
malts
and
toffee
the
feel
is
medium
with
good
carbonation
the
taste
is
again
mostly
malts
and
toffee
with
little
bitterness
and
a
little
spice
overall
it
was
decent
very
basic
in
my
opinion
nothing
that
particularly
stood
out
or
offended
me
just
a
decent
brew
not
sure
about
this
one
worthy
of
another
purchase
dunno
what
this
tasted
like
before
the
recipe
changed
but
i
doubt
that
i
care
as
this
was
a
supremely
tasty
winter
beer
that
really
hit
the
spot
ya
spicing
a
beer
is
fun
im
sure
but
with
such
a
delicious
malt
flavor
i
dont
see
the
necessity
of
spice
at
all
this
beer
pours
a
clear
amberbrown
color
the
head
is
half
an
inch
in
height
and
recedes
quickly
into
sparse
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
tons
of
caramel
and
toffee
with
some
nice
floral
notes
in
the
background
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
with
nice
malty
depth
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
velvety
texture
overall
this
is
a
solid
beer
that
i
would
happily
drink
again
slight
sour
finish
slight
dry
aftertaste
o
i
recognize
it
as
a
well
made
beer
but
some
of
the
aspects
particularly
on
the
nose
just
didnt
particularly
appeal
to
me
overall
very
well
done
scottish
ale
this
is
the
kind
of
beer
that
beer
geeks
tend
to
ignore
they
shouldnt
overall
this
is
a
wonderful
winter
brew
and
despite
its
lack
of
added
spices
would
go
down
well
on
a
cold
december
night
especially
if
that
entails
snuggling
in
front
of
the
fireplace
with
a
loved
one
this
poured
out
as
a
nice
looking
deep
red
color
the
head
was
fizzy
and
white
the
lacing
was
minimum
the
smell
of
the
beer
had
a
lot
of
malts
on
the
nose
it
was
also
pretty
sweet
smelling
the
taste
had
lots
of
malts
in
there
big
caramel
flavors
and
some
toasted
bread
aromas
the
taste
was
of
brown
sugars
and
malts
the
aftertaste
was
sweet
and
dry
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
semithick
feeling
overall
this
beer
was
pretty
good
all
around
i
thought
d
very
drinkable
the
beer
feels
really
smooth
and
well
balanced
could
use
a
bit
more
kick
but
there
is
enough
flavor
to
keep
it
interesting
and
it
does
not
feel
too
watery
drinkable
but
rather
onedimensional
for
the
style
lacks
the
fruitiness
that
characterises
a
good
scottish
ale
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
creamy
probably
quite
nice
when
drunk
next
to
a
roaring
fire
but
it
wont
blow
you
away
all
in
all
this
is
a
scottish
ale
with
a
certain
hop
bite
the
scottish
part
i
like
the
hoppy
part
i
like
but
the
two
dont
seem
to
tango
as
nicely
as
i
would
have
hoped
while
i
do
not
dislike
this
brew
i
have
no
reason
to
go
back
to
any
time
soon
this
beer
is
ok
but
certainly
not
a
favorite
brooklyn
certainly
has
better
offerings
than
this
brownish
orange
with
a
hint
of
red
a
bit
of
head
with
low
retention
spicey
light
phenolics
bready
malt
dark
fruit
malty
but
a
little
lacking
in
the
mouth
it
feels
a
little
thin
and
a
little
flat
seems
like
the
mouth
feel
and
carbonation
effect
the
taste
negatively
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
wish
it
tasted
as
good
as
it
smells
overall
not
overly
pleased
with
this
beer
hard
to
actually
determine
what
theyre
trying
to
do
with
it
is
it
a
saison
does
it
want
to
be
a
scotch
ale
when
it
grows
up
unfortunately
it
does
none
of
these
styles
well
overall
the
flavors
and
style
isnnt
my
usual
cup
of
tea
but
this
was
an
easy
and
pleasant
beer
none
the
less
if
offered
i
would
definitely
be
glad
to
take
one
and
enjoy
but
with
so
many
other
options
out
there
i
doubt
i
would
buy
again
pours
a
deep
copper
colour
one
finger
of
white
head
with
some
lace
on
the
glass
smells
of
malt
hops
caramel
and
a
slight
sweetness
of
toffee
taste
is
malty
spicy
warm
cinnamon
notes
firm
bitterness
and
a
good
hop
profile
quite
full
mouthfeel
slightly
creamy
with
good
carbonation
drinks
well
with
so
many
scotch
and
winter
beers
available
it
would
be
hard
to
put
this
ahead
of
most
of
them
it
is
good
and
i
would
have
it
again
solid
overall
bottle
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
minuscule
off
white
head
nose
is
lightly
nutty
with
a
sweet
malt
note
some
spicy
notes
here
as
well
flavor
is
sweet
with
woody
earthy
overtones
sweet
like
cinnamon
texture
is
medium
long
finish
with
no
distracting
aftertastes
taste
is
consistent
throughout
the
swallow
overall
a
good
beer
i
was
hoping
for
a
little
more
spiciness
or
complexity
but
this
beer
is
strongly
malty
the
cpj
d
mouthfeel
and
lack
of
complexity
lend
to
high
marks
here
first
time
i
had
this
brew
was
on
draft
in
the
city
and
i
remember
thinking
similarly
of
its
ontap
version
a
solid
choice
when
out
socially
at
a
nonbeergeek
bar
but
this
wont
make
it
onto
my
shelf
at
home
anytime
soon
overall
it
was
not
bad
rather
ehh
but
still
better
then
a
lot
of
the
style
i
would
not
really
have
a
problem
with
trying
this
one
again
if
it
was
sent
to
me
definitely
an
interesting
take
on
the
style
a
shame
really
as
winter
ales
go
this
is
no
winner
i
do
prefer
the
nonspiced
variety
as
this
is
but
it
needs
a
kick
up
the
arse
a
ballsier
hop
bill
touch
more
alcohol
and
little
bit
more
aggression
overall
would
have
seriously
improved
this
slightly
weak
and
illmannered
little
ale
reminiscent
of
a
very
traditional
old
style
english
ale
not
particularly
memorable
i
like
the
idea
of
a
scottish
style
winter
ale
i
wish
they
did
a
little
more
with
it
very
solid
beer
by
brooklyn
brewery
easy
to
drink
d
looks
good
smell
good
but
perhaps
a
little
lacking
in
richness
on
the
palate
and
moutfeel
a
little
thin
pleasant
enough
though
mouthed
sour
sweetness
tangy
real
tangy
lemony
roasted
malts
some
kind
of
wood
in
there
the
first
interesting
beer
i
have
had
in
a
while
not
an
all
day
drinker
though
6
1
coppery
the
alcohol
is
not
brave
but
also
not
hidden
it
comes
between
sips
from
winter
brew
tasting
notes
2010
pours
a
clear
amber
with
a
nice
2
to
3
finger
head
not
a
lot
of
retention
and
lacing
malt
heavy
smell
a
little
bit
of
graininess
coming
through
tastes
malty
as
the
smell
gives
on
very
light
up
front
a
bit
of
earthiness
comes
through
maybe
a
touch
of
hops
light
to
medium
bodied
with
a
decent
amount
of
carbonation
this
one
didnt
put
it
together
for
me
overall
not
a
bad
drink
it
went
down
faster
than
expected
but
not
a
great
interpretation
of
the
style
something
missing
and
a
bit
off
here
ok
but
i
wont
look
for
this
again
interesting
ill
give
em
that
i
let
it
warm
up
long
and
it
brought
out
the
best
a
little
too
muted
and
restrained
d
twelve
ounces
is
enough
for
me
an
ok
option
for
someone
looking
for
something
new
but
nothing
to
rave
about
and
lacks
the
solid
caramel
i
love
from
scottish
styles
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
d
the
drinkability
isnt
so
good
here
the
flavors
were
pretty
muted
and
it
was
a
bit
watery
i
just
wasnt
at
all
what
i
was
expecting
from
a
winter
beer
d
a
pretty
good
scotch
ale
that
is
above
average
and
pretty
easy
to
drink
would
order
again
d
very
easy
to
drink
and
revisit
this
beer
poured
a
dark
reddish
color
with
a
little
bit
of
head
smelled
like
typical
ales
and
not
very
strong
not
impressed
at
all
the
taste
was
thin
and
not
very
flavorful
like
other
winter
offerings
i
could
drink
this
beer
easily
but
for
a
seasonal
release
i
expected
more
i
would
pass
on
this
beer
sweet
and
spicey
but
not
too
overwhelming
like
some
winter
warmers
but
kinda
weird
aftertaste
higher
carbonation
medium
body
middle
of
the
pack
beer
although
this
one
might
now
wow
you
its
a
nice
beer
to
enjoy
on
a
cold
night
d
interesting
scottish
style
beer
not
bad
i
would
be
ok
if
i
had
another
one
or
not
very
drinkable
because
of
its
smooth
and
crisp
light
to
medium
body
brooklyns
winter
offering
does
not
stand
out
but
it
also
doesnt
dissapoint
verdict
if
its
a
beer
priced
in
the
79
sixer
range
its
worth
it
but
this
isnt
great
or
astounding
beer
one
of
the
other
reviewers
used
a
term
i
hadnt
heard
before
but
i
like
very
much
scorched
sugar
hits
in
on
the
head
the
beer
has
loads
of
upfront
malts
some
warming
notes
some
caramels
that
tend
to
bite
some
charred
notes
as
well
i
like
the
scorched
sugar
characterization
best
what
is
lacking
here
is
the
smoked
character
peaty
qualities
of
a
scottish
ale
there
arent
any
this
is
an
okay
beer
im
not
coming
back
to
anytime
soon
its
medium
bodied
and
some
of
the
malty
charred
sweetness
hangs
on
the
tongue
a
little
longer
than
i
would
prefer
traditional
scottish
ale
tastes
sweet
like
the
nose
not
cloying
at
all
though
mouthfeel
seemed
just
a
tad
astringent
very
drinkable
i
would
like
to
have
this
with
some
red
meat
unfortunately
this
first
beer
ive
had
from
brooklyn
will
be
put
into
service
as
one
to
cook
with
through
the
remainder
of
the
winter
impressed
with
the
rich
sweetness
of
this
brew
glad
to
see
another
winter
release
that
doesnt
rely
of
heavy
doses
of
spice
i
really
like
this
beer
but
the
richness
lessons
the
drinkability
in
my
opinion
is
it
close
to
style
most
likely
but
being
close
to
style
and
being
good
are
two
different
things
im
certain
there
are
many
more
winter
ales
out
there
that
are
worthy
of
your
time
and
many
more
selections
from
brooklyn
that
are
too
this
is
not
one
of
them
d
great
drinkability
great
winter
ale
my
first
brooklyn
ale
in
a
way
kind
of
what
i
expected
but
i
want
to
see
what
else
they
have
to
offer
dquite
drinkable
a
decent
winter
beer
this
is
a
stylish
winter
ale
that
one
could
enjoy
over
a
long
dark
winter
evening
a
very
good
effort
by
this
brewery
moreys
bottom
line
nothing
that
i
have
to
get
every
year
or
anything
but
i
certainly
dont
mind
when
i
do
as
far
as
the
style
goes
this
is
an
above
average
scotch
ale
db
definitely
carries
the
traits
of
a
scottish
ale
while
still
drinking
fairly
easily
not
something
i
would
buy
a
lot
of
but
still
pretty
nice
avoid
d
very
drinkable
not
the
typical
spicy
christmas
ale
if
thats
what
youre
expecting
4
0
d
not
as
flavorful
but
also
not
as
cloying
as
a
lot
of
scottish
ales
good
enough
for
another
one
d
not
quite
the
best
winter
beer
but
good
overall
drinkability
not
too
bad
though
id
say
its
pretty
middleofthepack
drinkability
is
good
but
its
not
thrilling
flavor
profile
is
a
bit
flat
and
lacking
some
of
the
caramelized
malt
flavor
that
typifies
the
style
i
can
think
of
several
other
scottish
ales
id
choose
over
this
most
of
them
being
yearround
offerings
big
head
on
pour
which
disappears
shortly
thereafter
the
color
is
reddish
brown
smells
and
tastes
of
malt
and
is
sweet
only
in
the
first
taste
then
is
rather
dry
drinks
better
than
it
tastes
by
which
i
mean
a
pleasant
but
not
overly
memorable
experience
with
no
winter
spices
or
odd
distractions
added
this
is
almost
like
drinking
a
newcastle
brown
ale
a
passable
but
not
overly
memorable
ale
id
say
sierra
nevada
or
full
sail
produce
winter
ales
of
greater
character
and
interest
but
if
you
like
the
brooklyn
brown
youll
like
this
one
fine
too
its
an
interesting
choice
for
a
winter
beer
while
others
seem
to
rely
on
thicker
sweeter
beers
for
winter
seasonals
this
is
not
like
that
at
all
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
smoky
beers
and
didnt
think
that
this
beer
was
otherwise
all
that
noteworthy
but
its
far
from
bad
this
is
a
beer
you
can
have
a
few
of
but
there
are
better
winter
ales
out
there
to
be
certain
notes
just
has
that
pils
malt
quality
maybe
its
the
diacetyl
whatever
it
is
tastes
average
like
they
are
more
concerned
with
just
getting
it
out
the
door
love
a
few
of
their
offerings
but
overall
just
think
they
do
average
brews
drinkability
i
usually
dont
drink
winter
ales
because
i
often
find
the
spices
overwhelming
this
ale
doesnt
have
that
distraction
so
i
will
gladly
have
another
drinkability
is
ok
but
i
would
need
to
mix
a
couple
dry
lagers
or
one
hoppy
pale
ale
in
the
mix
to
drink
these
all
night
poured
into
a
tumbler
pint
toffee
colored
beer
with
a
quick
receding
head
smells
and
tastes
very
malty
with
a
strong
toffeelike
flavor
no
hops
noted
in
smell
or
taste
pretty
thick
body
velvety
feel
on
the
tongue
booze
wellhidden
i
wont
go
back
for
more
of
these
drinkability
excellent
great
solo
beer
would
be
good
as
a
session
beer
a
very
delicious
winter
ale
and
my
i
think
first
scottish
i
too
was
surprised
to
find
that
there
are
no
spices
in
it
which
makes
it
pretty
special
to
me
and
i
was
very
pleased
with
its
deep
flavor
profile
pairs
very
well
with
some
of
the
more
hoppy
winter
ales
like
celebration
i
have
no
doubt
that
i
will
buy
and
enjoy
this
again
brooklyn
winter
boasts
a
caramel
brown
color
with
orange
edges
and
some
faint
rising
bubbles
up
top
a
nice
amount
of
foamy
suds
that
are
mediumish
tan
with
fullness
it
goes
down
quick
but
can
be
brought
back
to
life
smelling
this
i
was
like
what
the
hell
does
this
smell
like
and
then
it
hit
me
lager
yuengling
lager
to
be
exact
no
hop
scent
just
caramel
malt
and
some
grain
the
corn
is
missing
and
im
thankful
for
that
well
going
in
im
surprised
that
yes
this
indeed
tastes
like
yuengling
lager
down
to
a
t
a
bit
richer
though
the
feel
is
medium
smooth
and
easy
carb
is
minimal
just
a
touch
letting
you
know
this
is
alive
no
bite
no
bitter
i
drank
this
pretty
quick
its
simple
beer
for
simple
minded
folks
like
me
i
really
enjoyed
this
brew
malty
and
deep
and
delicious
excellent
seasonal
brew
m
good
job
brooklyn
nice
smooth
beer
very
concealing
of
its

think
its
also

drinkable

might
be
my
goto
beer
for
the

for
a
scottish
ale
pretty
enjoyable
since
i
tend
to
find
them
to
be
too
thick
syrupy
usually
nice
one
very
drinkable
with
a
nice
candy
like
finish
overall
i
liked
this
one
im
glad
to
see
my
palate
has
developed
some
since
i
had
it
last
where
i
hated
it
since
it
tasted
just
like
dough
to
me
certainly
worth
a
try
mouthfeel
is
good
could
be
a
little
better
i
find
many
scottish
ales
to
be
a
little
creamy
and
this
drifts
off
a
bit
further
from
the
trend
certainly
full
bodied
with
a
slight
bitter
finish
no
alcohol
bite
and
good
carbonation
levels
drinkability
is
good
all
in
all
another
quality
beer
from
brooklyn
brewery
notes
this
one
is
one
or
two
months
past
its
stated
prime
i
suppose
that
i
might
present
better
if
it
was
not
past
its
prime
or
on
tap
i
would
say
based
on
the
bottle
that
i
consumed
that
it
is
a
solid
scotch
ale
d
this
beer
is
one
that
can
be
quickly
consumed
its
rather
sessionable
particularly
during
the
colder
weather
months
d
an
interesting
idea
for
a
winter
seasonal
not
many
breweries
are
doing
a
scotch
ale
for
their
winter
beer
id
probably
come
back
to
this
one
again
next
year
d
may
need
a
fresh
one
and
will
update
review
but
overall
a
pretty
solid
brew
notes
this
is
a
very
solid
example
of
the
scottish
ale
style
and
a
great
winter
treat
its
medium
bodied
with
only
moderate
carbonation
and
the
6
abv
is
not
even
detectable
so
its
an
easy
drinker
all
in
all
not
my
favorite
winter
beer
but
by
far
not
my
least
favorite
would
definately
but
this
again
if
you
are
holding
on
to
any
it
will
probably
be
past
its
best
by
date
after
this
month
so
drink
up
or
toss
it
d
good
stuff
easy
to
put
down
and
nice
abv
i
feel
like
im
missing
out
by
not
having
this
on
cask
still
tasty
and
sessionable
the
kind
of
beer
id
love
to
buy
a
keg
of
verdict
straightforward
and
easily
drinkable
though
ultimately
just
a
little
thin
and
coppery
brooklyn
winter
ale
is
a
slightly
uninspiring
winter
seasonal
if
there
was
some
smokiness
and
peat
character
mixed
in
this
could
be
a
solid
scottish
ale
easy
drinking
winter
ale
and
another
good
one
from
brooklyn
this
is
a
solid
scottish
ale
and
doesnt
lift
your
kilt
up
but
it
is
still
very
nice
d
pretty
easy
drinking
but
not
too
much
like
the
style
it
claims
to
be
notes
not
overly
scottish
in
flavor
more
of
a
dark
sweet
bread
decent
beer
though
medium
carbonation
and
good
overall
body
another
nice
offering
by
brooklyn
brewery
d
this
is
good
winter
ale
but
not
my
favorite
style
as
with
some
other
brooklyn
beers
i
find
the
bready
character
too
pronounced
that
said
its
still
enjoyable
and
a
quality
ale
d
good
i
could
knock
back
a
few
of
these
i
wouldnt
go
to
any
major
lengths
to
seek
this
one
out
again
but
i
would
purchase
again
for
sure
i
think
this
is
by
all
means
a
fine
winter
ale
lucky
i
gots
myself
a
few
for
the
next
days
d
abv
is
fairly
low
but
for
some
reason
this
beer
will
sneak
up
on
you
probably
the
big
flavors
soothing
you
into
a
beer
euphoria
not
the
most
remarkable
scottish
ale
but
solid
in
every
respect
drinkability
a
very
good
tasty
drinkable
beer
perfect
for
winter
if
you
can
find
it
pick
up
a
sixer
and
find
out
how
drinkable
it
can
be
its
smooth
rich
malts
speaks
for
itself
nice
and
freshing
cheers
the
mouthfeel
is
also
right
on
for
the
style
there
is
a
nice
balance
between
crisp
carbonation
and
luscious
soft
body
the
result
is
a
smooth
creamy
beer
with
a
light
sizzle
on
the
tongue
a
pleasure
to
drink
with
the
feel
of
it
and
the
lingering
warm
caramel
malts
in
the
finish
a
nice
beer
that
id
like
to
drink
all
year
long
despite
the
name
drinkability
a
great
beer
and
one
of
my
new
favorite
winter
seasonals
i
wish
this
one
were
easier
to
find
in
my
area
and
a
little
cheaper
but
this
is
really
good
ill
certainly
be
trying
to
find
more
by
the
end
of
the
season
this
is
an
excellent
winter
beer
its
not
the
assault
on
the
senses
that
some
scottish
ales
can
be
but
its
solid
in
its
own
right
goes
great
with
pot
pie
drinkability
definitely
very
sessionable
and
i
could
see
myself
having
another
had
i
bought
more
than
one
went
well
with
vegetable
soup
and
bread
a
cold
winter
dish
but
i
could
see
this
going
very
well
with
a
hearty
stew
as
well
d
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
drinkability
is
ok
the
flavor
is
not
particularly
complex
in
my
opinion
and
there
isnt
much
here
to
make
me
want
to
have
another
but
id
drink
it
if
i
had
to
its
not
terrible
but
ive
had
much
better
examples
of
the
style
poured
into
a
pint
glass
nice
clear
dark
amber
color
not
much
head
at
all
no
lacing
smell
is
spicy
malty
and
fruity
taste
is
very
much
the
same
cinnamon
apple
and
malt
biscuit
undertones
good
taste
for
a
winter
brew
they
call
this
a
scottish
ale
i
guess
thats
okay
but
robert
the
bruce
is
unbelievably
better
this
is
not
bad
though
drinkability
and
carbonation
are
good
pours
a
deep
dark
brown
with
ruby
highlights
minimal
head
on
this
one
smell
is
of
sweet
malts
with
slight
nods
to
grass
and
earth
taste
is
more
mellow
than
scent
dictaed
but
slightly
muddled
earthy
and
sweet
malt
taste
with
very
little
complexity
seems
messy
metallic
and
herbal
presence
confuse
the
palate
hops
lead
to
a
bitter
finnish
at
the
end
medium
bodied
slightly
overcarbonated
for
the
style
muddled
and
messy
for
the
style
needs
more
flavor
and
charachter
drink
is
decent
nothing
really
jumping
out
at
me
but
a
good
winter
ale
just
a
malty
beverage
cheers
orangeamber
in
color
with
no
head
malty
metallic
scent
this
is
accentuated
in
the
taste
roasted
malt
present
up
front
but
then
something
reminiscent
of
a
rusted
iron
pipe
theres
also
a
faint
hint
of
hops
its
gotta
be
the
style
because
ive
just
never
run
across
a
scottish
ale
that
ive
enjoyed
short
review
but
just
not
a
lot
to
say
about
this
one
poured
from
a
cellartemperature
bottle
into
a
standard
pint
glass
beer
is
a
beautiful
clear
tawny
brown
with
many
rising
bubbles
visible
head
is
thick
and
tan
longlasting
with
very
small
bubbles
the
smell
is
malty
and
slightly
toasted
mildly
yeasty
this
beer
is
delicious
it
tastes
of
caramel
and
toasted
malts
and
finishes
sweet
but
clean
a
lingering
maltiness
follows
in
my
mouth
the
carbonation
lends
crispness
and
keeps
the
beer
from
feeling
heavy
or
thick
despite
the
higher
alcohol
content
this
beer
is
very
smooth
and
mildly
warming
without
any
harshness
or
heat
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
i
could
spend
a
long
winter
evening
drinking
pint
after
pint
poured
from
a
cellar
temperature
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
has
a
beautiful
clear
rust
color
with
a
thick
tan
foam
head
there
is
an
earthy
hop
aroma
it
has
a
good
malty
flavor
with
a
distinctly
cream
ale
feel
its
very
good
heavy
body
and
not
too
much
carbonation
this
is
a
fine
scottish
style
ale
one
that
i
want
to
drink
more
of
a
solid
effort
but
not
really
one
of
my
favorite
winterchristmas
ales
fine
beer
with
a
weak
nose
but
a
solid
flavor
that
works
around
the
holiday
season
well
d
despite
being
underwhelming
in
the
aroma
taste
and
mouthfeel
departments
this
beer
does
seem
to
go
down
smooth
nonetheless
it
is
low
enough
in
alcohol
that
its
almost
sessionable
value
way
overpriced
for
a
product
that
will
be
sure
to
annoy
the
budget
conscious
beer
drinker
i
can
definitely
tell
this
one
is
a
scottish
ale
although
it
tastes
more
english
to
me
nothing
special
in
the
appearance
dark
gold
the
big
ivory
head
was
weak
unspectacular
and
fizzled
quick
toasted
biscuit
and
sweet
malt
aroma
same
in
the
taste
nothing
complex
and
a
metallic
taste
in
the
finish
very
unimpressive
not
that
its
a
terrible
beer
just
mediocre
example
too
much
carbonation
d
certainly
drinkable
definitely
a
highly
drinkable
beer
the
feel
is
very
enjoyable
and
the
flavors
and
aroma
are
mild
enough
to
please
pretty
much
any
beer
drinker
d
very
warming
and
refreshing
beer
good
choice
for
seasonal
holidays
this
poured
a
clear
dark
copper
with
some
tan
head
it
smelled
like
roasted
barley
and
bread
crust
with
sweet
caramel
and
some
copper
and
vanilla
it
tasted
like
copper
and
caramel
and
bread
crust
with
some
vanilla
and
roasted
barley
it
was
fairly
thick
with
a
bit
of
carbonation
and
had
a
bittersweet
aftertaste
overall
this
was
a
very
nice
clean
tasting
beer
with
good
holiday
flavors
that
werent
overdone
it
had
great
body
too
and
was
very
easy
to
drink
nothing
too
exciting
or
unique
but
this
is
a
solid
winter
seasonal
d
drinkability
is
good
i
guess
you
can
hace
two
or
three
until
you
crave
something
more
complex
overall
not
as
complex
as
i
would
have
liked
and
really
doesnt
warrant
the
price
for
a
six
pack
pretty
dull
but
i
say
that
about
most
scottish
ales
meh
pours
a
copper
color
with
just
a
thin
bito
head
that
settles
into
a
ring
the
aroma
is
pretty
muted
on
this
beer
all
i
really
pickup
is
some
faint
grassyness
and
some
slight
crispness
the
front
end
is
very
crisp
and
pretty
thin
not
a
whole
lot
of
flavor
the
middle
offers
a
lot
more
malt
flavor
but
then
it
finishes
pretty
thin
with
some
lingering
from
the
malts
overall
the
balance
isnt
great
on
this
one
too
much
carbonation
not
enough
body
a
rare
miss
from
from
brooklyn
this
could
be
served
as
a
good
gateway
beer
neither
too
heavy
for
a
beginner
or
too
light
to
give
a
proper
impression
after
this
one
though
bigger
brews
should
follow
this
is
also
plenty
good
as
a
session
beer
drinkability
is
fairly
high
goes
down
pretty
easy
pretty
nice
and
drinkable
but
a
little
bland
and
disappointing
considering
the
promise
of
the
nose
nice
enough
though
im
usually
a
big
brooklyn
fan
and
maybe
me
expectations
were
high
but
i
was
disappointed
in
this
one
i
thought
one
of
their
weaker
efforts
it
started
out
well
pouring
with
a
clear
rich
amber
color
and
a
nice
thick
head
it
also
laced
great
marking
every
sip
but
as
good
as
it
looked
i
thought
the
taste
lacked
any
character
slightly
bitter
finish
dont
get
me
wrong
it
is
a
well
made
ale
and
most
seem
to
like
it
just
did
not
excite
me
only
problem
is
that
the
sweet
malt
flavor
profile
is
rather
one
dimensional
there
isnt
much
else
going
on
i
could
have
a
couple
but
might
get
bored
of
it
medium
bodied
with
some
okay
mouthfeel
a
little
spicy
and
tingly
on
the
tounge
it
is
definitely
drinkable
cheers
mfd
medium
bodied
didnt
really
hace
the
smokiness
of
a
scotch
ale
but
still
a
decent
seasonal
brew
drinkability
a
highly
drinkable
malty
beer
this
one
reminds
me
of
their
octoberfest
with
different
spicesat
least
in
the
maltiness
i
could
have
several
brooklyn
winter
ale
tastes
like
a
scottish
ale
lite
but
i
like
that
because
its
not
heavy
and
cloying
but
relatively
light
and
refreshing
while
there
are
some
of
the
heavy
scottish
ales
that
i
love
but
i
dont
know
maybe
this
is
just
a
case
of
hitting
the
right
spot
maybe
tomorrow
i
would
rate
it
down
the
color
is
a
legitimate
red
with
a
small
off
white
head
that
faded
the
aroma
is
malty
sweet
and
floral
the
taste
is
sweet
and
slightly
soapy
it
is
medium
bodied
and
well
carbonated
and
drinkability
is
very
good
d
this
beer
doesnt
quite
hit
the
marks
like
dirty
bastard
but
at
6
and
bring
the
only
scotch
ale
around
no
ill
take
this
tasty
brew
basically
i
agree
with
the
previous
reviewer
this
scottish
ale
is
somewhat
astringent
yet
very
easy
to
drink
not
the
maltiest
of
scots
and
not
the
best
brew
this
brewery
has
to
offer
straight
bs
for
brooklyn
winter
ale
this
beer
is
a
pretty
average
offering
serving
type
bottle
this
beer
pours
a
handsome
reddishcopper
color
with
a
thick
inchtall
head
lacing
is
good
the
nose
is
moderately
malty
caramel
with
a
slight
toasted
edge
with
a
bit
of
noble
hop
aroma
a
generous
maltiness
is
the
dominant
taste
component
offering
a
smooth
caramel
flavor
with
a
bit
of
light
toasted
breadcrust
hops
are
restrained
but
detectable
get
one
a
pretty
nice
winter
beer
would
go
well
with
christmas
dinner
poured
into
a
standard
pint
glass
dark
red
color
but
almost
brown
huge
white
head
creates
a
nice
contrast
nice
looking
beer
smell
was
full
of
malt
taste
was
very
pleasing
malty
backbone
toasted
chestnuts
cinnamon
and
even
a
bit
of
peat
are
what
i
tasted
this
might
be
one
of
the
better
tasting
winter
ales
on
the
market
not
overloaded
with
spice
but
enough
to
lend
it
some
taste
lots
of
malt
flavor
but
just
enough
to
make
it
very
drinkable
sturdy
body
but
goes
down
well
this
is
the
kind
of
beer
that
is
perfect
on
a
cold
night
or
by
a
fireplace
does
brooklyn
make
any
boring
beers
nope
this
one
is
a
winner
for
me
this
is
really
bland
i
was
looking
forward
to
this
because
i
love
scottish
ales
this
is
not
a
good
example
of
the
style
no
peat
smoke
or
any
real
toasted
flavor
besides
brooklyn
chocolate
stout
i
have
had
nothing
that
i
really
enjoy
from
them
not
something
i
would
recommend
overall
pleasantly
drinkable
and
subtle
flavor
reminds
me
of
a
vienna
lager
in
the
sa
boston
ale
vein
very
drinkable
this
is
a
standby
beer
if
you
are
looking
for
one
this
winter
d
i
would
have
never
have
guessed
this
was
a
scottish
ale
with
that
being
said
it
is
a
nice
winter
brew
not
over
the
top
but
with
the
medium
body
some
etoh
heat
and
darker
flavor
profiles
d
this
is
an
eminently
drinkable
beer
it
goes
down
very
smoothly
combines
a
good
amount
of
light
refreshing
tastes
and
senses
with
nonetheless
a
good
sweet
warm
malt
presence
taste
caramel
and
a
little
brown
sugar
kinda
dry
mild
bitterness
a
decent
winter
ale
definitely
malt
heavy
with
loads
of
earthy
hops
almost
like
a
lager
in
its
cleaness
with
just
a
touch
of
fruitiness
not
bad
not
great
i
would
love
some
more
complexity
drinkability
its
good
stuff
not
outstanding
but
really
solid
this
beer
pours
a
blonde
amber
color
with
an
off
white
head
that
fades
with
a
quickness
the
aroma
offers
up
some
fruity
esters
with
a
bit
of
caramel
sweetness
at
the
back
the
taste
follows
suite
with
a
nice
sweet
almost
spicey
taste
up
front
with
an
intersting
hop
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
good
with
a
little
higher
co2
than
i
would
have
expected
but
a
really
nice
drink
with
a
some
really
nice
caramel
notes
the
beer
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
dry
caramel
aroma
thats
pretty
nice
but
nothing
spectacular
the
taste
is
decent
as
well
it
has
a
very
dry
crystal
malt
flavor
with
little
hop
character
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
as
well
it
is
a
mediumfull
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
an
above
average
beer
but
a
lousy
scottish
ale
d
fairly
drinkable
but
something
about
it
just
doesnt
fit
overall
a
pretty
decent
beer
though
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
i
have
not
bought
alot
of
winter
beers
per
say
in
the
past
to
me
winter
time
is
my
stout
time
but
this
is
very
drinkable
and
good
i
could
get
a
case
and
enjoy
on
a
cold
night
very
nice
just
as
any
vintage
of
wine
reflects
the
climate
of
where
it
was
grown
and
that
seasons
weather
so
too
should
a
beer
provide
similar
sensations
i
wouldnt
have
considered
this
beer
great
but
for
it
to
draw
my
imagination
into
a
cozy
scottish
local
harbored
from
the
damp
windy
february
weather
just
by
the
taste
of
it
then
surely
thats
a
beer
well
made
poured
a
beautiful
mahogany
color
smelled
of
caramel
malts
taste
was
of
caramel
malts
and
maybe
hint
of
nutmeg
hides
the
alcohol
well
but
there
is
enough
there
to
give
you
that
warming
feel
good
carbonation
on
this
mediumfull
bodied
beer
drinkability
is
good
especially
during
these
cold
witner
months
enjoyable
beer
cheers
pretty
good
drinkability
overall
not
a
musttry
but
it
was
worth
drinking
i
like
the
toastedroasted
malt
flavor
a
better
beer
than
i
feared
it
would
be
since
the
friend
who
gave
this
to
me
said
he
didnt
like
it
and
i
know
hes
a
big
brooklyn
beer
fan
a
fairly
drinkable
scotch
ale
nothing
great
here
but
not
too
bad
worth
a
try
mfd
eh
drinkable
but
not
a
session
beer
honestly
my
thoughts
of
brooklyn
brewery
have
subsided
as
each
offering
i
try
seems
to
get
worse
and
worse
overall
this
beer
really
didnt
click
with
me
nothing
overwhelmingly
bad
about
it
but
nothing
that
would
make
me
want
to
buy
it
again
the
taste
just
wasnt
there
not
really
balanced
d
this
is
a
pretty
good
scottish
ale
i
like
this
take
on
a
winter
ale
because
it
wasnt
just
a
winter
warmer
overall
an
okay
brew
but
i
feel
like
something
is
slightly
missing
here
even
though
in
general
im
huge
fan
of
brooklyn
brewery
this
one
is
good
though
could
be
slightly
better
nice
enough
beer
but
not
the
best
in
the
pack
by
a
stretch
esters
in
the
finish
throw
the
package
off
feel
is
smooth
but
slightly
thin
plus
somewhat
astringent
finish
carbonation
seems
a
bit
too
fizzy
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
color
was
orangey
brown
with
a
1
finger
white
bubbly
head
the
head
left
a
thin
layer
that
clung
to
the
sides
well
aroma
was
sweet
smelled
of
vanilla
honey
and
citrus
flavor
was
sweet
spicy
cloves
with
some
malty
aftertaste
felt
goo
in
the
mouth
coated
very
well
just
enough
carbonation
to
give
it
kick
almost
too
sweet
to
drink
overall
impression
taste
seemed
off
with
possibly
oxidized
i
will
need
to
acquire
another
six
pack
to
determine
if
mine
was
contaminated
the
feel
is
thick
and
syrupy
smooth
and
buttery
its
a
decent
sweet
ale
i
would
like
a
tad
of
a
burnt
balance
but
ill
take
this
one
d
at
a
little
over
6
i
couldnt
drink
more
than
34
of
these
in
a
short
evening
which
means
its
pretty
drinkable
very
alcohol
tasting
to
be
honest
and
lots
of
bite
too
much
bite
it
is
too
strong
in
my
opinion
not
enough
balance
d
with
a
fair
amount
of
carbonation
and
nothing
overpowering
on
the
taste
this
could
stretch
into
a
session
beer
in
fact
i
picked
up
a
six
pack
after
having
it
on
draft
last
weekend
not
the
first
beer
of
the
night
and
it
holds
up
nicely
the
tangy
slightly
bitter
finish
reminds
you
to
take
one
more
sip
in
the
end
i
thought
this
winter
ale
was
too
sweet
with
sweet
yeast
it
couldnt
make
up
its
mind
whenever
to
go
with
roasted
or
burnt
malts
and
the
aroma
was
not
good
one
of
these
was
good
enough
for
me
d
this
is
a
great
session
beer
that
pairs
really
well
with
thicker
foods
like
stew
it
can
take
spice
and
help
deflect
it
a
bit
as
well
as
enhance
its
underlying
sweetness
good
full
mouthfeel
and
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
was
surprised
with
this
beer
malty
with
upfront
caramel
flavors
something
a
bit
off
with
the
smell
a
bit
sicksweet
which
compounds
the
sweetness
of
the
beer
nice
carbonation
sweetness
moderated
by
dry
bitter
finish
but
the
finish
is
overbearing
probably
would
not
buy
this
again
d
brooklyn
winter
ale
is
a
pretty
solid

that
is

with

a

to
reflect

this
at
a

drink
extremely
easy
a
great

i
will
definitely
pick
some
more
up
overall
an
enjoyable
winter
beer
to
check
out
d
im
a
fan
of
scottish
ales
and
this
is
a
very
good
one
while
some
lean
too
much
on
the
malt
sweetness
i
find
this
ale
to
be
a
great
balance
i
could
easily
session
with
this
beer
and
i
plan
on
picking
up
more
before
winter
is
over
nice
mediumbodied
holiday
ale
especially
for
having
the
spice
without
additives
better
than
average
as
a
scottish
ale
too
pours
a
crystal
clear
amber
color
with
orange
hues
and
a
one
finger
off
white
head
with
good
retention
and
patchy
lacing
aromas
of
toasted
malt
apricot
caramel
there
is
a
biscuity
flavor
up

with
some
chocolate
and
a
tea

with
the
sweet
malt
and
fruity
yeast
flavors
in
the
finish
medium
carbonation
and
body
with
a
very
dry
finish
very
drinkable
d
a
good
beer
that
seems
like
an
ampedup
marzen
by
its
aroma
and
flavor
profile
big
malt
monster
of
a
beer
no
hop
flavour
but
just
enough
bittering
hops
to
keep
this
from
becoming
cloyingly
sweet
medium
body
moderate
carbonation
a
bit
strong
in
the
abv
department
but
still
a
nice
sipping
beer
for
the
winter
season
rather
drinkable
its
good
not
epic
or
memorable
mouthfeeldrinkability
the
ingredients
expressed
themselves
for
a
fine
seasonal
and
drinkable
beverage
d
not
too
bad
at
all
overall
a
very
drinkable
solid
winter
seasonal
poured
a
reddish
brown
into
my
goblet
with
a
fingerwidth
sandy
bubbly
head
which
quickly
disappeared
and
reappeared
briefly
after
a
bit
of
agitation
i
think
the
lack
of
head
may
be
more
because
of
a
flaw
with
the
pour
or
my
glass
aroma
is
malty
a
little
spicy
despite
the
change
in
recipe
with
raisin
and
caramel
mouthfeel
is
light
and
slick
with
some
sandpapery
carbonation
action
which
was
surprising
based
on
the
completely
inactive
appearance
of
the
beer
taste
is
nuts
caramel
toffee
dry
wood
very
malty
and
with
a
little
hop
presence
with
a
very
dry
finish
drinkability
is
good
due
to
the
inoffensive
nature
of
the
brew
this
is
my
first
scotch
ale
overall
this
is
a
solid
brew
brooklyns
winter
ale
is
a
winner
theres
not
a
great
deal
to
complain
about
here
its
not
quite
on
the
level
of
black
chocolate
stout
as
far
as
their
winter
arsenal
goes
but
its
impressive
all
the
same
i
think
a
little
more
of
a
hop
presence
would
slightly
improve
it
but
i
cant
complain
too
much
im
too
busy
being
impressed
recommended
this
is
a
drinkable
scottish
ale
and
a
nice
winter
brew
clear
amber
with
a
creamy
tan
head
that
leaves
minimal
lacing
smells
kind
of
smoky
malty
chocolate
and
coffee
tastes
fairly
sweet
caramel
and
chocolate
but
with
a
coffee
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
fairly
thin
and
mildly
carbonated
very
drinkable
and
tasty
mild
scotch
ale
drinkability
for
a
winter
style
beer
it
was
very
very
light
and
easy
drinking
for
such
a
light
colored
winter
beer
it
packed
a
decent
amount
of
flavor
and
complexities
it
can
catch
up
with
you
if
your
not
careful
but
its
a
good
beer
to
get
drunk
with
while
enjoying
a
nice
ale
deep
reddish
tint
to
this
one
substantial
head
leads
to
faint
lacing
nose
is
somewhat
toasty
and
hints
at
the
malty
sweetness
to
come
a
good
roasty
peaty
hit
followed
by
mild
bitterness
could
use
just
a
little
more
body
and
a
slight
drop
in
the
sweets
d
solid
and
enjoyable
but
not
what
i
expect
from
a
scottish
ale
this
almost
strikes
me
as
more
of
a
winter
warmer
d
drinkable
and
easy
to
drink
with
more
flavors
than
the
bells
christmas
ale
but
they
are
still
muted
flavors
that
dont
stick
out
d
overall
this
is
an
ok
beer
but
it
didnt
do
that
much
for
me
a
carefullycrafted
beer
with
a
fantastic
malt
profile
one
of
the
more
memorable
winter
beers
ive
ever
tasted
will
definitely
seek
it
out
again
overall
this
is
very
different
than
most
winter
brews
though
outstanding
nevertheless
this
beer
is
very
mild
in
every
aspect
yet
tasty
and
very
satisfying
its
exceptional
smoothness
makes
this
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
that
can
easily
be
enjoyed
on
a
cold
winters
night
by
any
beer
drinker
who
prefers
maltier
beers
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
great
easy
drinking
winter
ale
a
standard
d
goes
down
well
not
bad

all

this
was
fine
with
my
meal
but
not
particularly
memorable
either
way
d
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
but
it
certainly
isnt
a
great
scottish
ale
instead
it
tastes
like
some
sort
of
strange
hybrid
between
a
weak
scottish
ale
and
a
quasibelgian
style
ale
failing
in
both
respects
a
strange
beer
thats
either
entirely
off
base
or
obscenely
mediocre
either
way
not
something
i
would
have
again
pours
a
deep
red
copper
has
a
balanced
malty
aroma
mouth
feel
is
slightly
heavy
with
syrup
like
texture
much
like
other
scottish
ales
the
taste
is
malt
all
the
way
through
with
a
hop
undertone
that
gives
it
balance
it
reminds
me
of
the
wee
heavy
style
this
beer
is
very
enjoyable
and
i
highly
recommend
it
d
christmas
beer
or
not
this
is
a
unique
scottish
ale
regardless
and
mr
olivers
decision
keep
the
lid
on
tradition
has
left
him
with
a
smooth
gentlemanly
brew
that
seems
to
put
itself
past
other
novelty
no
matter
how
superb
offerings
expertise
is
shown
to
me
by
the
malt
combination
if
any
are
even
smoked
at
all
and
the
addition
of
oats
this
would
be
a
tremendous
pair
with
any
red
meat
hats
off
and
merry
xmas
quite
dry
but
there
is
a
notable
alcohol
warmth
very
creamy
with
a
low
level
of
carbonation
nice
but
minor
hop
at
the
swallow
overall
this
is
a
very
full
bodied
malty
ale
with
a
lot
of
vanilla
pours
a
clear
amber
brown
color
with
an
average
tan
head
that
settles
into
sparse
cap
the
aroma
is
of
lemon
tea
and
perhaps
a
touch
of
brown
sugar
the
taste
is
of
a
metallic
lemony
malt
quite
astringent
some
caramelbuttery
notes
and
a
slight
earthness
in
the
end
the
winter
ale
has
a
nice
chewy
malty
body
which
is
quickly
cut
by
a
lemony
astringent
characteristic
the
tartness
of
this
brew
kills
it
for
me
i
feel
it
takes
away
from
what
should
be
a
nice
malty
brew
this
one
just
doesnt
do
it
for
me
d
i
enjoyed
this
more
than
i
thought
i
would
4
or
5
would
be
my
limit
for
the
night
unless
the
others
got
lonely
overall
a
really
damn
good
beer
on
tap
at
bone
dry
and
served
in
a
shaker
this
beer
poured
a
copper
brown
hue
with
a
lasting
head
of
creamy
beige
foam
decent
lacing
the
aroma
was
made
up
of
lightly
sweet
caramel
bread
crust
and
brown
sugar
the
flavor
mirrored
the
aroma
nice
and
malty
but
not
too
robust
the
mouthfeel
was
mediumbodied
and
had
moderate
carbonation
not
too
shaby
but
i
wouldnt
mind
seeing
this
one
beefed
up
a
bit
d
a
really
nice
scottish
ale
easy
to
drink
and
warming
all
at
the
same
time
mouthfeeldrinkability
slick
and
rolling
in
the
mouth
letting
the
ingredients
express
themselves
fully
a
great
seasonal
that
i
look
forward
to
trying
again
with
a
nice
soup
or
stew
quite
a
different
beer
in
its
younger
incarnation
with
a
distinctly
different
character
that
is
in
a
way
a
bit
more
scottish
in
character
with
its
thick
peaty
malt
character
a
great
representation
of
the
style
overall
i
had
low
expectations
for
this
winter
ale
since
it
claims
to
not
be
spiced
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
however
and
would
definitely
recommend
this
to
whoever
can
find
it
ah
brooklyn
you
never
let
me
down
every
beer
they
make
is
just
so
damn
solid
and
tasty
this
one
is
no
exception
the
appearance
is
great
my
sister
even
pointed
it
out
and
she
knows
nothing
about
beer
with
the
nice
red
color
and
tons
of
lacing
the
taste
is
not
overkill
like
some
scottish
ales
not
tons
of
smokiness
here
just
a
nice
malty
taste
with
a
touch
of
ethanol
great
easy
finish
makes
for
a
nice
smooth
drink
thumbs
up
this
scottish
ale
is
dark
reddish
brown
with
a
beautifully
frothy
tan
headd
it
smells
of
sweet
malts
lots
of
malts
with
and
a
hint
of
alcohol
the
flavor
is
dominated
by
yummy
toasted
malts
a
light
brown
sugar
sweetness
and
a
small
amount
of
hops
whose
profile
i
can
only
describe
as
deadgrass
or
fallen
leaves
this
beer
has
an
almost
woodlike
quality
about
it
it
has
an
exceptionally
smooth
medium
body
that
is
finely
carbonated
this
might
be
my
favorite
seasonal
this
year
its
such
a
pleasure
to
drink
props
to
brooklyn
for
another
wellcrafted
brew
i
will
drink
this
over
other
winter
brews
but
i
try
to
avoid
winter
brews
overall
m
d
a
little
sharp
on
the
tongue
carbonation
is
kinda
overenthusiastic
almost
leaves
a
little
tingle
on
the
finish
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
outside
of
that
little
biting
sensation

offerings
ive
tried
so
far
drinkability
for
a
6
beer
this
is
very
drinkable
easily
could
put
down
7
or
8
of
these
in
a
sitting
this
beer
is
worth
a
try
drinkability
i
thought
id
tried
this
before
but
i
was
wrong
that
said
im
glad
i
did
and
its
enjoyable
but
there
are
better
more
flavorful
winter
brews
out
there
one
of
the
brooklyn
brews
ill
leave
for
others
to
try
especially
with
the
black
chocolate
stout
always
around
this
time
of
year
drinkability
certainly
recommended
yet
another
quality
brew
thats
both
tasty
and
easily
drinkable
from
brooklyn
brewery
the
taste
has
a
similar
malty
base
with
a
bitter
center
but
the
two
flavors
seem
to
be
fighting
more
than
melding
together
there
also
are
some
yeast
and
metal
notes
that
dont
quite
ring
true
for
me
i
dont
get
any
smoke
or
spice
or
any
the
typical
scottish
qualities
i
think
i
like
the
winter
warmer
version
better
not
for
me
thanks
pours
a
clear

dark

color
with
a
decent
off
white
head
that
slowly
fades
smells
of
very
sweet
malts
taste
of
dark
sweet
malts
maybe
some
dark
fruit
in
there
not
a
complete
scotish
ale
lacks
the
full
taste
and
mouthfeel
it
comes
across
and
little
weak
at
the
end
great
drinkability
though
i
liked
this
beer
a
lot
it
was
tough
to
decifer
overall
this
beer
is
worth
a
shot
but
its
only
slightly
above
average
d
food
friendly
and
more
than
drinkable
warms
the
throat
smooth
with
a

2007
edition
thanks
to
crushinator
te
aroma
is
consistent
with
the
scottish
style
malty
and
peaty
it
drinks
very
smooth
even
creamy
above
average
mouthfeel
there
is
lots
of
lace
it
is
very
drinkable
for
the
style
which
is
a
swallow
at
a
time
this
beauty
is
a
creamy
brown
color
with
a
very
solid
offwhite
head
and
the
lacing
is
also
very
solid
the
aroma
is
grassy
hops
and
mild
caramel
it
has
a
nice
mellow
caramel
flavor
with
herbal
hop
bitterness
it
has
a
bit
of
dr
pepper
flavor
which
i
really
like
moxie
almost
a
very
smooth
midbody
ale
theres
a
bit
of
chocolate
hint
and
plenty
of
toffee
very
flavorful
but
minimal
alcohol
so
it
is
plenty
drinkable
very
pleasant
i
had
one
at
about
5am
and
it
was
like
having
some
chocolate
malt
before
bed
good
filling
this
barley
hops
yeast
and
water
mixture
poured
up
nice
generic
brown
color
little
carbonated
head
that
died
real
quick
not
much
aroma
just
some
subtle
malts
some
smoked
peat
would
have
been
nice
taste
is
kinda
boring
just
lots
of
deep
malts
without
a
very
full
body
not
very
apparent
hop
character
typical
i
feel
the
dark
cherries
and
figs
trying
to
come
out
to
play
but
the
heavy
malts
wont
let
them
definately
english
style
malts
medium
bodied
low
carbo
im
not
a
big
scottish
ale
fan
but
this
is
no
traquair
for
sure
drinkability
is
great
a
great
cool
weather
companion
day
or
night
more
please
well
then
for
a
winter
warmer
this
one
sure
has
a
firm
handshake
as
for
being
a
scottish
ale
it
is
still
big
on
the
malt
without
being
cloyingly
sweet
very
palatable
still
im
good
after
one
of
these
more
than
full
and
satiated
pours
a
mostly
clear

some

and
floral
finish
bit
of
alcohol
some
iron
very
caramelized
finish
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
a
bit
warm
but
easy
to
drink
turns
out
this
is
a
decent
scottish
ale
which
is
ok
since
a
winter
beer
can
really
be
anything
as
long
as
it
is
hearty
tastes
a
little
like
our
local
nelson
faceplant
the
beer
is
mid
brown
with
not
much
of
a
nose
the
flavour
is
quite
malty
but
the
beer
is
very
balanced
a
garret
quality
a
very
pleasant
drinking
beer
for
these
still
cold
evenings
this
would
be
a
nice
beer
to
sit
back
and
relax
with
while
watching
a
football
game
it
is
a
little
malty
but
it
is
smooth
and
if
you
like
smokey
flavorings
this
a
good
one
d
another
great
from
brooklyn
this
hefty
brew
makes
for
a
very
enjoyable
winter
drinking
experience
perfect
after
a
long
day
of
homework
while
it
is
pretty
heavy
its
still
a
pleasure
to
drink
and
im
pretty
sure
i
could
down
a
couple
of
these
especially
since
its
abv
isnt
too
high
i
look
forward
to
my
next
one
poured
a
deep
amber

it
smells
deep
rounded
satisfying
a
really
fine
beer
balanced
and
solid
something
to
warm
you
on
a
winter
night
drinkability
is
nice
a
good
seasonal
ale
not
particularly
my
style
but
decent
for
what
it
tries
to
be
i
dont
regret
buying
it
but
i
dont
know
if
id
buy
it
again

decent

initial
taste
is
of
malts
but
then
leads
to
a
slightly
tangy
bitterness
to
round
things
out
i
was
worried
that
this
was
going
to
be
another
allmaltandonlymalt
winter
beer
experience
and
was
happy
that
this
offered
a
bit
more
nothing
bad
about
this
beer
but
it
just
didnt
wow
me
i
dont
regret
the
six
pack
but
i
doubt
id
buy
it
again
i
tasted
it
before
i
read
the
summary
of
it
that
stated
there
was
no
spice
added
i
swore
there
was
cinnamon
or
something
added
to
this
one
of
the
best
versions
of
the
style
ive
ever
had
many
craft
breweries
try
this
style
and
fail
but
this
one
succeeds
with
flying
colors
malty
beers
arent
really
my
style
but
this
is
an
incredible
success
way
to
go
i
could
drink
several
of
these
beers
dgood
i
could
have
a
few
this
ale
has
a
good
drinkability
i
could
drink
a
few
more
of
these
d
very
easy
drinking
beer
tastes
of
roasted
malts
sour
fruits
spices
i
know
they
dont
put
any
in
and
caramel
this
beer
is
okay
but
i
wouldnt
consider
it
a
outstanding
example
of
a
scottish
ale
its
drinkable
but
if
youre
looking
for
a
scottish
ale
you
should
pass
on
this
one
not
recommended
note
this
beers
profile
improved
noticably
as
the
beer
warmed
probbaly
would
be

d
this

is

not
great
its
worth
a
try
if
you
get
the
chance
but
there
are
better
winter
beers
out
very
interesting
for
a
scotch
ale
in
fact
it
tastes
like
a
combination
of
a
winter
warmer
and
a
scotch
ale
overall
tone
down
the
carbonation
a
bit
and
you
have
a
winner
the
flavor
is
a
nice
flowery

accompanied
by
caramel
sweetness
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
full

very

as

is
earthy
i
think
that
is
the
top
classification
here
beyond
just
saying
earthy
a

the
flavor

all
about

the
worst
offering
from
brooklyn
i
have
had
seems
like
a
there
is
a
disparity
in
the
reviews
perhaps
there
are
some
bad
batches
floating
around
wouldnt
try
again
there
are
better
scottish
ales
out
there
but
its
not
quite
inspiring
either

that
was

an

i
cant
wait
to
have
one
with
a

or
better

probably
due

than
a

down

there
is
another
bitter
kick
in
the
finish
o
sourness
masks
some
of
the
malt
flavor
admittedly
an
old
bottle
bought
on
sale
last
summer
and
saved
for
colder
weather
in
my
experience
there
is
no
guarantee
any
particular
style
will
age
well
and
this
is
another
instance
where
perhaps
it
did
not
not
a
particularly
remarkable
or
memorable
ale
easy
enough
to
drink
and
some
decent
malty
notes
coming
through
but
not
much
complexity
develops
nicely
though
good
session
ale
i
poured
this
okay
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
45
degrees
the
beer
was
cocola
colored
pouring
a
pretty
big
head
that
had
really
bid
bubbles
i
guess
that
is
why
they
did
not
last
very
long
either
the
beer
smelled
really
good
it
had
a
rich
caramelly
hazel
nut
smell
that
i
thought
was
going
to
be
yummy
it
was
not
though
and
in
fact
the
beer
was
fruity
tasting
with
a
bitter
finish
i
will
not
buy
again
o
a
good
effort
here
it
takes
a
little
coaxing
but
some
good
complexity
both
aromatically
and
in
the
mouth
comes
through
the
pint
bottle
is
a
good
serving
considering
the
low
alcohol
and
easy
approachability
this
is
an
easy
drinker
very
good
for
a
cool
spring
evening
the
beer
has
a
mild
sweet
flavor
and
a
bit
of
a
hop
bite
at
midpalate
the
hops
give
it
a
somewhat
woody
kind
of
taste
making
it
slightly
tart
the
beer
is
nicely
carbonated
and
is
medium
bodied
the
hop
profile
makes
it
a
somewhat
unique
scottish
ale
but
i
honestly
prefer
examples
with
more
malty
sweetness
this
one
strikes
me
as
a
bit
unbalanced
perhaps
i
have
had
too
many
americanmade
scottish
ales
and
not
enough
scottish
scottish
ales
o
the
flavors
in
this
beer
are
good
its
a
nice
little
scotch
ale
not
bad
for
1
25
on
sale
overall
a
very
nice
scot
whose
acquaintance
i
am
glad
to
have
met
cheers
to
illudium
for
the
sample
its
a
little
thin
but
nicely
balanced
and
very
easy
to
drink
extra
note
this
was
very
cheap
and
full
of
flavor
lots
of
bang
for
the
buck
probably
the
most
ideal
80
ive
encountered
or
remember
i
drank
my
fair
share
of
shilling
ales
in
scotland
a
couple
years
back
favorite
broughton
ale
so
far
thank
heavens
i
found
a
fresh
bottle
if
i
could
have
one
of
these
just
about
every
day
id
just
about
be
happy
d
goes
down
easy
nothing
stopping
one
from
drinking
a
few
of
these
in
one
sitting
might
be
carbonated
enough
to
make
you
pretty
gassy
if
you
tried
though
mouth
great
body
creamy
yet
bubbly
light
flavor
of
malt
hop
super
well
balanced
some
biscuitlike
flavors
almost
like
soda
biscuits
unbelievably
easy
to
drink
i
could
drink
this
all
day
everyday
d
a
nice
mouthfeel
and
taste
combo
does
make
the
beer
still
pretty
drinkable
alcohol
presence
was
still
evident
but
nothing
too
overbearing
or
anything
that
really
detracted
from
the
quality
of
the
beer
or
the
overall
drinking
experience
of
it
worth
a
go
if
you
can
grab
it
definitely
a
pretty
solid
scottish
ale
drinkability
i
think
this
would
be
outstanding
in
cask
form
and
id
love
to
have
another
bottle
of
this
right
now
its
a
bit
heavy
so
i
could
see
myself
stopping
at
two
but
its
a
great
beer
by
itself
or
with
a
meal
beef
bacon
tomato
sauce
pasta
ive
had
this
before
and
its
just
as
good
now
as
it
was
the
first
time
ive
had
it
a
great
beer
d
a
wee
bit
above
average
while
not
hard
to
drink
i
cant
see
myself
running
back
to
the
fridge
for
another
a
good
after
dinner
drink
taste
was
that
of
a
red
or
brown
ale
maybe
the
visuals
were
warping
my
mind
more
than
a
scotch
ale
little
hop
but
the
malt
aspect
felt
peaty

be
one
of
the
other

wood
smoke
maybe
a
little

price
could
be
better

with
two

great

midpalate

possessing
a
dry
orange

mediumbodied
and
smooth
with
more
carbonation
than
expected
given
the
appearance
too
maltysweet
to
session
not
bad
at
all
the
nose
is
just
amazing
but
it
kind
of
falls
apart
from
there
worth
a
try
but
there
are
better
versions
of
the
style
50

pretty
good
beer
drinkable
with
some
good
flavor
drinkability
i
can
easily
put
back
several
of
these
beers
like
the
merlins
ale
the
broughton
ales
has
another
winner
here
not
your
traditional
scotch
ale
but
nevertheless
an
enjoyable
ale
that
i
could
have
all
year
round
cheers
d
very
drinkable
could
definitely
go
through
a
couple
of
these
in
a
sitting
if
youre
not
worried
about
the
cost
ill
be
picking
this
one
up
again
for
all
the
blather
and
chestbeating
on
the
label
about
the
brave
warrior
depicted
on
the
label
this
was
actually
a
soft
and
polite
beer
weakcoffee
colored
that
gets
quite
dense
in
the
middle
of
the
glass
and
bright
around
the
edges
decent
head
with
loose
bubbles
nice
aroma
of
coffee
chocolate
figs
other
dense
fruit
and
a
bit
of
sharp
citrus
as
expected
from
an
ale
from
the
uk
decent
body
perhaps
a
little
thin
pleasant
taste
that
seemed
lighter
than
it
should
be
given
the
color
of
the
beer
still
there
was
a
good
amount
of
fruity
malt
and
a
nice
if
padded
tang
of
hops
at
the
end
could
be
a
bit
more
forward
in
both
taste
and
aroma
but
still
very
drinkable
definitely
worth
the
cost
a
bit
pricey
but
well
worth
trying
the
clerk
at
perfect
pour
recommended
it
good
advice
gorgeous
dark
amber
in
the
glass
with
a
soft
foamy
head
that
fell
slightly
but
never
really
left
slight
sweet
malt
in
the
nose
and
the
initial
taste
very
enjoyable
caramel
malt
with
subtle
hops
bitterness
to
round
out
the
flavor
profile
nicely
balanced
not
too
sweet
and
an
incredibly
enjoyable
offering
really
solid
atmosphere
great
appearance
and
pretty
good
nose
thats
quite
typical
of
the
style
really
good
flavor
balance
although
not
complex
something
i
really
like
about
this
style
palettes
are
pretty
basic
but
full
flavored
and
robust
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
quaff
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
it
has
a
good
flavor
and
i
could
see
myself
grabbing
one
if
it
was
available
or
if
the
mood
strikes
me
just
right
i
dont
know
if
i
would
pay
10
90
for
it
in
a
theme
bar
like
i
did
in
kalamazoo
mi
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
pretty
good
beer
the
foam
was
a
rich
dark
wheat
color
and
feel
the
color
of
this
scot
beer
was
deep
red
and
beautiful
with
a
simple
but
pungent
aroma
the
taste
at
first
had
acute
feel
followed
by
a
deep
malty
fullbodied
flavor
very
hearty
and
great
drinkibility
feel
pours
a
ruby
tinted
seethru
brown
w
wellcarbonated
onefinger
tan
head
that
quickly
died
a
floral
earthy
hop
aroma
with
minor
fruit
notes
and
a
subdued
bread
malt
sensation
w
hints
of
caramel
and
hints
of
some
roasted
malts
as
well
a
little
heavy
but
mostly
mediumbodied
and
smooth
has
a
molasses
stickiness
feeling
on
the
sides
and
finishes
slightly
dry
from
roasted
malts
comprised
of
some
minor
malt
sweetness
and
is
a
little
buttery
and
also
contains
some
dark
druit
tastes
and
maybe
figs
a
balanced
beer
that
i
could
relax
with
anytime
this
beer
poured
a
clear
dark
amber
color
with
decent
white
head
that
dissipated
to
a
thin
film
along
the
top
aroma
was
of
roasted
malt
sweetness
peat
caramel
flavor
was
the
same
and
nicely
balanced
mouthfeel
was
pleasant
pretty
fullbodied
i
enjoyed
this
ale
and
it
would
make
a
nice
session
beer
overall
very
good
beer
excellent
balance
of
flavor
and
mouthfeel
d
drinkability
is
very
good
solid
session
beer
taste
is
smooth
toffee
sweet
caramel
malt
honeynut
cheerios
and
roasted
nuts
ends
smooth
and
just
a
touch
of
bitterness
drinkability
nicely
balanced
with
plenty
of
flavor
this
is
an
excellent
example
of
a
flavorful
session
ale
in
the
scottish
style
500
ml
bottle
best
before
july
2009
served
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
dark
copperruby
red
color
with
an
inch
tan
head
head
retention
and
lacing
are
both
good
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
malty
it
smells
like
toasted
malt
molasses
caramel
dark
fruit
nuts
and
peat
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
but
not
quite
as
strong
it
tastes
like
molasses
toasted
malt
nuts
peat
smoke
dark
fruit
and
a
bit
of
pepper
mouthfeelbody
is
lightmedium
its
dry
and
a
littly
bit
velvety
it
also
seems
a
bit
thin
to
me
the
drinkability
is
pretty
good
its
smooth
and
very
easy
to
drink
drinkability
is
good
its
nice
and
sessionable
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
in
a
sitting
overall
i
think
this
is
a
pretty
decent
brew
d
this
is
a
nice
scottish
ale
that
is
very
quaffable
overall
a
good
straightforward
example
of
a
scottish
ale
if
a
little
on
the
one
dimensional
side
worth
a
try
though
pours
a
deep
copper
amber
color
with
a
tall
and
medium
bodied
tan
colored
head
that
laces
the
glass
vrey
well
on
the
way
down
the
aroma
is
of
very
sweet
malts
some
faint
hop
bitterness
and
then
what
seemed
like
a
hint
of
a
sweet
scotch
smell
the
taste
was
also
nice
as
well
with
a
very
sweet
malty
base
followed
by
a
sweeter
scotchy
sort
of
flavor
and
then
a
tiny
bit
of
a
hoppy
bitterness
at
the
end
to
round
out
the
flavor
so
it
wasnt
too
sweet
really
nice
mouthfeel
very
fresh
and
velvety
feeling
this
is
a
very
drinkable
scottish
ale
as
i
would
gladly
have
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
session
d
good
drinkability
nicely
balanced
and
not
overly
sweet
allowing
you
to
enjoy
multiples
with
ease
felt
great
just
enough
carbonation
to
make
its
presence
known
not
bad
but
certainly
not
the
best
depiction
of
the
style
an
excellent
scottish
ale
it
has
a
great
dark
copper
color
nearly
opaque
with
nice
head
and
excellent
lacing
a
very
nice
sweetmalty
scent
with
hints
of
lavenderheather
in
it
a
wonderfully
malty
flavor
with
hints
of
peat
its
thick
but
very
smooth
and
very
refreshing
an
excellent
nearsession
scottish
ale
overall
i
really
did
not
know
what
to
expect
going
into
this
one
the
ales
in
this
scottish
gift
pack
have
all
seemed
to
be
pretty
straightforward
with
nothing
really
standing
out
as
being
outstanding
or
that
much
different
in
any
way
this
was
my
favorite
of
them
so
far
having
a
bit
more
depth
and
a
large
flavor
then
the
ones
before
it
i
would
actually
not
mind
having
this
again
and
it
is
probably
very
good
on
tap
not
half
bad
i
would
have
to
say
this
is
now
one
if
not
my
favorite
scotch
ales
the
big
bold
malt
flavor
is
right
on
this
beer
is
pretty
damn
good
sometimes
i
wish
i
live
in
the
uk
so
i
wouldnt
have
to
pay
all
of
the
damn
import
taxes
or
fees
on
these
fine
brews
eric
this
was
very
nice
however
it
was
like
a
christmas
pudding
beautiful
aromas
nice
rich
taste
and
a
lot
of
mouthfeel
however
i
serving
was
more
than
enough
ideal
if
you
are
in
the
mood
for
one
beer
but
not
to
be
taken
in
any
real
quantity
i
bought
this
completely
blind
having
never
heard
of
the
brewery
even
so
im
very
happy
with
my
choice
pours
out
quite
a
dark
red
fading
into
brown
at
the
top
of
the
glass
head
is
about
three
fingers
and
a
moderate
tan
in
colour
lasts
well
and
leaves
good
lacing
smell
is
nearly
archetypal
for
a
scottish
ale
strong
caramel
molasses
and
smoky
peat
nuttiness
and
fruits
apples
and
raisins
are
present
as
well
taste
is
along
the
same
lines
the
nutty
malts
making
a
stronger
case
for
themselves
but
the
dark
caramel
and
peat
smoke
holding
their
own
very
mild
metallic
note
in
the
finish
hardly
noticible
but
slightly
distracting
mouthfeel
is
slightly
thin
good
carbonation
though
drinkability
is
quite
good
nice
example
of
a
scottish
ale
but
nothing
extraordinary
overall
a
refreshing
scottish
ale
i
wish
i
could
try
it
a
bit
closer
to
its
place
of
origin
however
d
the
smell
led
me
to
believe
this
was
going
to
be
something
really
special
had
some
nice
roasted
characteristics
but
pretty
straight
forward
if
you
ask
me
pours
from
the
bottle
to
a
dark
brown
with
hintgs
of
ruby
red
and
an
offwhite
head
that
lingers
thru
midglass
and
leaves
some
but
not
much
lacing
aroma
is
a
mild
malty
roasted
nuts
with
a
bit
of
toffee
taste
is
a
continuation
of
the
mild
malty
sweetness
though
never
real
pronounced
nicely
balanced
wioth
hops
finish
was
nice
and
smooth
and
overall
this
was
a
darn
good
beer
of
which
i
could
drink
several
drinkability
is
okay
but
these
are
not
necessarily
my
favorite
style
anyway
considering
i
share
my
name
with
the
beer
i
had
to
try
it
notes
this
is
a
beer
i
really
enjoyed
that
being
said
this
is
an
offering
that
is
best
as
a
stand
alone
offering
hard
to
follow
or
preceed
this
beer
what
a
huge
compliment
slainte
mhath
drinks
fairly
well
but
over
all
i
was
expecting
more
caveat
emptor
pours
clear
dark
mahogany
with
thin
creamy
head
but
thick
lace
aroma
is
dominated
by
toasted
biscuit
malts
and
underpinned
with
fragrant
floral
and
leafy
hops
flavor
follows
the
aroma
nicely
toasty
slightly
smoky
even
caramel
malts
intertwine
with
leafy
hops
and
a
bit
of
hard
mineral
water
leaving
a
well
balanced
bitter
finish
quite
creamy
and
lightly
carbonated
medium
body
finally
a
worthwhile
beer
from
the
folks
at
broughton
ales
this
was
very
enjoyable
and
a
pleasure
to
drink
i
only
wish
i
had
thought
to
buy
more
the
taste
is
solid
with
a
front
that
is
similar
to
a
juicy
apple
tartness
followed
by
caramel
and
brown
sugar
that
finishes
with
burnt
chocolateroasty
malt
and
hops
the
hops
at
the
end
linger
on
the
tongue
a
little
too
long
for
my
interest
and
seem
out
of
place
but
overall
this
is
a
solid
taster
mouthfeel
is
well
carbonated
and
passes
through
with
ease
and
it
isnt
too
thick
or
thin
to
be
displeasing
but
does
lean
towards
the
watery
side
low
abv
makes
for
easy
drinking
but
the
overall
sweetness
and
price
doesnt
make
this
a
regular
grab
for
me
hit
it
bernie
mac
there
are
serious
flavors
in
here
very
dark
brown
with
light
tan
retention
that
proves
promising
smells
very
malty
fruity
and
lightly
smoky
and
peatey
earthy
and
sweet
in
the
nose
and
leads
directly
to
flavors
dark
caramelized
malts
shows
molassas
dates
figs
grapes
and
nuts
a
little
dirty
flavor
from
the
smoked
peat
adds
complexity
and
boldness
weighted
on
the
toung
without
feeling
overly
heavy
a
bit
slick
and
viscous
finishes
sweet
with
a
lingering
hop
bitterness
that
was
not
present
until
the
end
the
beer
makes
good
its
escape
from
the
500ml
brown
bottle
into
my
glass
the
color
a
deep
blood
red
the
head
bunyanesque
in
size
the
texture
creamy
and
the
color
a
beauteous
light
tan
as
it
slowly
dematerializes
the
lace
forms
a
concealing
blanket
to
obscure
the
glass
nice
rich
malt
nose
with
a
bit
of
caramel
sugar
like
and
a
bit
of
fresh
churned
butter
start
is
lightly
sweet
the
grain
profile
adequate
and
the
top
light
to
medium
in
feel
finish
is
surly
in
its
acidity
the
hops
perfection
quite
dry
and
refreshing
on
this
100
degree
day
in
arizona
a
fizziness
as
best
as
i
can
describe
is
what
i
felt
during
the
drink
slightly
oily
and
good
to
drink
this
is
a
mellow
flavorful
intricately
crafted
scottish
ale
i
guess
i
found
broughtons
top
dog
flavor
is
toasty
caramel
slightly
woody
finish
is
clean
and
dry
with
a
hint
of
smokiness
perfect
mouthfeel
but
just
a
tiny
tiny
bit
too
much
of
hop
otherwise
a
5
i
would
drink
this
beer
all
day
everyday
i
was
beginning
to
think
broughton
ales
brewed
nothing
but
mediocre
beer
kinmount
willie
was
a
disaster
this
offering
is
definitely
a
beer
of
a
different
color
its
a
fabulous
example
of
the
scottish
ale
style
and
has
flavor
to
burn
let
loose
the
dogs
of
war
but
first
drink
up
drinkability
and
notes

this
is
my
first
straight
up
scottish
ale
after
many
wee
heavies
this
is
the
most
drinkable
beer
i
have
had
of
scottish
origin
but
it
is
probably
the
least
flavorful
that
being
said
the
flavors
there
are
good
and
balanced
and
for
the
style
this
beer
is
right
where
it
is
supposed
to
be
this
would
be
a
good
beer
for
anyone
who
is
overwhelmed
by
either
the
intense
flavors
or
alcohol
found
in
wee
heavies
i
personally
prefer
the
hard
stuff
though
the
appearance
is
fantastic
color
is
a
hazy
dark
brown
with
a
thick
light
brown
head
carbonation
is
fairly
high
and
head
retention
is
excellent
aroma
is
of
sweet
earthy
malts
with
a
bit
of
spice
the
taste
primarily
consists
of
sweet
earthy
malts
with
a
mild
nutty
character
a
light
roast
flavor
also
makes
its
presence
felt
the
english
hops
give
the
beer
a
nice
spice
kick
which
imparts
balance
and
depth
of
flavor
overall
the
taste
is
nicely
layered
and
pretty
highly
complex
this
is
great
stuff
and
is
helping
the
scottish
ale
become
one
of
my
new
favorite
styles
a
very
fine
scotch
aleflavorful
rich
and
wellbalanced
i
like
it
i
like
it
i
can
consume
this
happily
though
its
no
milestone
of
taste
its
still
a
noble
ale
and
im
happy
to
imbibe
fantastic
poured
a
dark
red
burgundy
colour
with
a
beautiful
craggy
off
white
head
that
dissipated
in
about
30
seconds
or
so
nice
sticky
lacing
the
smell
is
just
fantastic
a
little
sweet
a
lot
like
oatmeat
this
actual
smelled
almost
like
a
little
debbie
oatmeal
cream
snack
cake
the
taste
was
a
bit
sweet
as
well
with
a
slightly
pronounced
oatmeal
taste
a
little
bit
of
a
bitter
hop
bite
on
the
finish
just
delicious
the
mouthfeel
was
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
carbonation
was
mild
just
the
right
level
this
stuff
is
extremley
good
and
a
wonderful
example
of
the
style
simply
smashing
this
is
the
3rd
of
the
4
pack
i
received
as
a
gift
and
so
far
like
it
less
than
the
others
i
like
the
bit
of
history
on
the
bottle
i
think
it
helps
to
enjoy
it
a
little
more
the
beer
poured
up
nice
with
a
frothy
head
that
faded
fast
i
thought
it
would
be
black
in
color
but
it
looks
like
what
i
would
expect
for
a
brown
ale
the
flovor
is
a
bit
nutty
with
slight
alcohol
finish
would
be
a
pretty
good
pick
for
a
cold
day
definetly
worth
a
try
best

creeping
through
the
complex
aroma
tealike
tannins
and
a
light
hop
and
malt
astrincency
round
out
the
finish
while
the
initial
wash
on
the
tongue
is
a
complex
malty
one
pumpernickel
bread
tree
bark
blackstrap
molasses
and
roasted
barley
chock
full
of
earthiness
quite
a
unique
brew
this
is
a
very
decent
scottish
ale
that
hits
the
spot
on
a
cool
autumn
evening
very
well
crafted
and
true
to
style
this
comes
close
to
being
something
special
but
isnt
pours
a
nice
rich
color
with
little
head
or
carbonation
definate
malty
tastes
especially
at
the
beginning
and
towards
the
end
more
fruity
tastes
very
smooth
to
drink
with
no
bad
aftertaste
less
bitter
then
other
scottish
ales
and
personally
my
favorite
all
in
all
a
very
drinkable
beer
especially
relaxing
after
a
meal
nice
drinkable
brew
but
there
are
better
examples
of
the
style
this
pours
out
a
deep
ruby
with
a
frothy
pillow
of
a
head
think
cappuccino
leaves
a
very
nice
lacing
aromas
are
just
mouth
watering
fruits
and
spices
toastedsweet
malt
just
really
nice
creamy
in
the
mouth
smooth
but
not
heavy
it
goes
down
oh
so
easy
flavors
are
all
over
big
toasted
sweet
malt
backbone
fruits
and
spices
are
plentiful
caramel
and
toffee
just
damn
flavorful
this
was
a
suprise
to
me
i
didnt
expect
to
enjoy
this
as
much
as
i
did
overall
a
more
than
solid
drinkable
scottish
ale
hella
i
really
like
the
bottle
and
the
look
of
this
brew
but
it
was
a
little
harsh
for
my
tastes
im
probably
not
ready
or
used
to
this
style
right
now
the
color
was
deep
purple
and
the
smell
was
of
alcohol
dark
ripe
fruit
heavy
malt
it
smelled
like
a
port
wine
to
me
the
taste
was
heavy
and
a
little
abrasive
with
no
attempt
at
hiding
the
alcohol
at
all
i
really
felt
like
i
was
drinking
a
strong
wine
or
something
the
was
a
nice
assertive
bitter
aftertaste
but
overall
not
my
cup
of
tea
the
beer
pours
a
dark
amberbrown
color
with
a
thick
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
excellent
it
has
a
rich
and
creamy
malt
scent
that
boasts
of
crystal
and
roasted
barley
it
has
lots
of
toasted
smells
awesome
the
taste
is
great
also
it
has
a
rich
toasted
malt
complexity
that
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
dry
and
slightly
bitter
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
damn
good
beer
i
love
the
aroma
and
flavor
very
nice
a
fine
scottish
ale
i
will
buy
again
not
bad
but
not
good
either
nice
toasty
dark
carmel
color
with
small
ruby
hints
along
the
edge
head
is
a
bubbly
dense
beige
pillow
very
pleasing
to
the
eye
smell
has
some
hints
of
traditional
scotch
ales
some
faintly
discernable
peat
flavors
hints
of
smoke
and
toasted
bread
taste
is
much
of
the
same
nice
toasty
malt
through
and
through
malty
sweetness
is
followed
up
with
the
slightest
hints
of
oily
chocolate
and
peat
to
finish
medium
to
light
bodied
moderatly
carbonated
a
very
good
beer
bought
on
my
scotland
trip
last
summer
and
kept
in
my
fridge
until
dinner
tonight
this
is
a
very
attractive
beer
served
out
of
a
thistle
glassbig
puffy
creamcolored
head
atop
a
deep
brown
liquid
the
aroma
is
what
i
would
call
mediumstrength
malt
its
not
as
intense
as
a
lot
of
strong
scottish
ales
but
presents
nice
thick
layering
of
malt
notes
the
beer
is
a
little
grainy
with
toasted
and
caramel
notes
as
well
again
foremost
sensation
is
maltiness
with
a
mediumintensity
smooth
mouthfeel
and
medium
body
the
beer
finishes
with
a
hint
of
bitterness
easy
drinking
but
not
really
very
challenging
it
pours
a
dark
rootbeerteak
color
with
a
smallish
beige
head
a
toasty
malt
nose
is
upfront
while
a
mild
hoppy
aroma
lies
in
the
background
the
malt
is
the
driving
force
behind
this
brew
lots
of
toffee
and
deep
roasted
barley
make
for
substantially
malty
ale
apples
pears
and
limes
make
up
an
interesting
fruity
combo
a
slight
metallic
tang
and
mild
tealike
bitterness
produce
a
bit
of
an
edge
to
an
otherwise
sweet
and
malty
brew
a
solid
beer
in
every
attribute
hefty
malt
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
with
vague
apple
notes
and
some
caramel
malt
to
carry
things
along
a
little
lingering
bittersweetness
at
the
finish
which
is
quite
pleasant
and
not
cloying
although
neither
the
flavor
or
body
are
heavy
the
beer
nonetheless
manages
to
come
across
as
quite
substantial
in
profile
a
nice
quaffer
jg
mp
this
beer
looked
like
a
dark
mud
but
actually
a
nice
shade
of
brown
had
a
light
tan
colored
frothy
head
some
good
carbonation
and
little
lace
nose
was
very
nutty
and
of
roasted
malt
taste
was
light
nut
and
hops
the
malt
was
restrained
solid
body
for
a
lowalcohol
brew
and
some
fruit
taste
came
through
with
time
short
finish
and
the
mouthfeel
was
quite
dry
goes
down
pretty
watery

decent

really
liked
the

of
this
one
a
perfect
beer
for

in
my
opinion
a
true
scottish
ale
great
scottish
imports
i
recommend
highly
i
loved
this
beer
i
am
a
malt
man
instead
of
a
hop
head
and
this
is
what
i
think
a
real
scottish
should
be
admittedly
it
could
have
a
much
bigger
body
on
it
but
at
least
it
is
well
attenuated
most
of
the
scottish
i
have
tried
has
been
too
damn
sweet
this
beer
has
a
big
malty
caramel
nose
to
it
and
an
enormous
complex
malty
flavor
and
finishes
dry
not
sweet
a
hop
might
have
passed
by
the
brew
kettle
but
if
it
did
it
didnt
stay
long
this
is
my
kind
of
beer
and
i
regret
not
stocking
up
on
more
definitely
give
this
one
a
try
12oz

head

thin
layer

aroma
is
biscuity
with
caramel
peat
and
trace
smoke
a
few
swirls
regenerates
the
head
nicely
a
very
smooth
brew
the
sweetness
is
offset
by
the
peat
and
subdued
hop
flavors
not
as
big
and
bold
as
the
name
suggests
but
solid
nonetheless
enjoyable
brew
notes
this
is
a
product
of
brewing
excellence
big
on
drinkablity
for
a
medium
bodied
brew
and
packed
with
flavour
and
lots
of
malt
complexity
by
far
one
of
the
best
scottish
ales
imported
to
the
states
a
light
peaty
coloured
beer
with
a
thick
offwhite
head
it
has
a
roasted
malt
nose
with
a
bot
of
wood
smoke
and
a
slight
but
rather
unfortunate
hint
of
antiseptic
this
has
a
sweet
start
and
is
lightly
smoky
with
the
influence
of
oats
apparent
in
a
creamy
finish
o
to
me
this
beer
tastes
a
lot
more
like
a
lighter
version
of
an
english
stout
compared
to
a
scottish
ale
the
low
alcohol
content
definitely
makes
this
very
drinkable
o
very
nice
enjoyable
ale
lot
of
flavor
and
it
works
together
a
bit
of
a
thin
light
body
for
my
taste
but
still
a
nice
beer
that
was
quite
enjoyable
smooth
and
tasty
4
i
was
hoping
it
would
be
a
tad
sweeter
like
a
scotch
ale
tends
to
be
but
i
think
the
honey
just
totally
dries
it
out
to
much
and
doesnt
leave
enough
of
a
mouthfeel
an
easy
quickdrinking
beer
for
a
session
with
friends
o
quality
beer
i
would
categorize
this
as
a
hoppy
brown
ale
there
are
darker
malt
flavors
but
no
burnt
sugars
the
body
is
thinner
like
a
brown
ale
as
well
the
server
thought
this
was
a
stout
decent
hop
presence
finish
is
bitter
burnt
carbon
there
is
almost
something
uniquely
appealing
after
a
few
sips
a
bright
burned
character
but
it
just
doesnt
quite
make
it
there
tastes
like
someone
just
left
it
in
the
oven
too
long
i
had
great
anticipation
for
this
beer
yet
it
turned
out
quite
boring
poured
a
2
head
very
dark
raw
umber
in
color
very
little
smell
even
after
warmed
up
mild
coffee
at
most
flavor
as
well
was
pretty
simple
and
subdued
some
mild
coffee
a
little
sour
rye
a
little
acidity
body
was
quite
lightweight
surprisingly
timid
and
disappointing
considering
where
where
its
from
and
how
dark
the
brew
is
different
and
very
drinkable
as
a
mild
boozier
less
fruity
and
drier
than
others
nice
feel
and
hops
but
not
crazy
about
the
aftertaste
light
mouthfeel
almost
a
bit
creamy
but
just
almost
with
a
luxurious
carbonation
with
small
soft
bubbles
refreshing

and
creamy
bitter

i
liked
this
one
d
a
standard
scottish
ale
inoffensive
with
enough
flavour
for
a
session
simple
and
effective
pours
a
fairly
dark
reddish
brown
with
a
somewhat
slight
head
that
fades
to
a
ring
and
leaves
some
scant
lacing
smells
bready
and
slightly
herbal
and
earthy
a
slight
hint
of
honey
right
at
the
end
pretty
mellow
stuff
with
lots
of
breadiness
in
the
mouth
and
some
more
very
light
herbal
and
honey
flavors
at
the
end
there
is
a
slighty
browned
taste
that
makes
the
whole
thing
taste
like
honeyed
toast
a
bit
with
an
herbal
tang
smooth
but
a
bit
lighteer
than
id
like
in
body
my
first
from
the
brewery
ill
be
sure
to
try
some
more
pours
a
two
finger
beige
head
that
fades
slowly
leaving
a
good
lace
black
color
faint
highlights
medium

me
a
very

good
price

tiny
traces

and
a

background
the
sweet

notes
wash
over
the
tip
of
your
tongue
then
slowly
the
smoke
start
to
fill
your
mouth
giving
way
to
toffee
and
coffee
the
finish
has
a
roast
malt
bitterness
that
becomes
smoky
then
coffee
a
tasty
smooth
drink
a
good
example
of
its
style
it
is
low
in
abv
and
quite
drinkable
my
only
qualm
would
be
that
it
could
be
fresher
or
even
chewier
otherwise
a
good
find
overall
enjoyable
and
drinkable
enough
though
nothing
memorable
the
bitter
sweet
aftertaste
might
be
a
little
too
much
for
some
though
this
was
a
fantastic
looking
pint
i
dont
think
the
rest
of
it
would
cause
me
to
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
it
again
overall
a
good
straightforward
example
of
a
scottish
ale
recommended
d
not
bad
not
my
favorite
style
but
drinkable
nonetheless
the
first
of
three
new
scottish
beers
at
smokeless
joes
in
toronto
i
tried
this
beer
on
march
20
2008
the
beer
poured
a
blackishbrown
with
a
creamy
tan
head
that
lasted
throughout
the
aroma
was
roasted
malt
some
licorice
hints
and
some
hops
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
and
some
sourness
on
the
sides
of
the
tongue
the
flavour
was
malty
and
nutty
with
continued
sourness
smokeless
joes
basically
a
good
british
style
porter
black
not
much
head
smooth
stouty
roasty
a
whisp
of
smoke
and
tabacco
and
licorice
drinkable
but
a
sipper
because
minerally
finish
it
would
fare
better
with
some
food
as
a
coffee
replacement
filling
overall
a
bit
disappointing
this
came
as
a
present
from
scotland
of
a
pair
of
scotch
ales
i
much
preferred
the
three
sisters
atlas
brewery
one
this
might
be
better
with
food
i
did
enjoy
it
but
one
did
not
leave
me
with
a
desire
for
another
instead
i
simply
moved
on
to
try
some
of
the
other
beers
i
purchased
it
is
very
drinkable
but
not
enough
to
capture
my
taste
throughout
an
evening
cask
at
the
muckle
cross
elgin
scotland
dark
mahogany
brown
with
a
lovelly
thick
creamy
light
tan
head
lightly
toasted
malts
of
course
dominate
the
aroma
with
stronger
bitter
black
coffee
notes
the
taste
is
of
rich
and
bitter
maltiness
slightly
burnt
aspects
to
it
some
coffee
and
a
slightly
lactic
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
very
nice
velvety
smooth
caskconditioned
i
found
this
a
very
nice
porter
probably
improved
by
the
cask
very
drinkable
i
have
to
say
this
is
my
first
scottish
ale
that
wasnt
mcewens
and
i
liked
it
a
lot
better
honestly
on
my
first
sip
i
was
a
bit
put
off
but
after
i
started
to
think
of
this
beer
as
a
sort
of
scotch
i
really
started
to
like
it
im
also
really
enjoying
the
finish
with
a
scotch
the
smoke
fades
into
the
alcohol
too
much
but
with
the
beer
its
just
you
and
the
peat
for
quite
some
time
this
ones
original
and
downright
amazing
this
brew
poured
a
dark
brown
copperish
color
with
a
decent
tan
head
that
quickly
disapated
nose
was
very
smoky
and
peaty
taste
was
pretty
much
the
same
the
barley
was
probably
dried
over
a
mostly
peat
fueled
firevery
unique
to
the
u
s
and
interesting
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
thin
but
the
beer
was
very
smooth
overall
drinkability
was
near
perfect
i
could
have
easily
enjoyed
another
pint
of
this
very
dark
in
clolorwhen
held
to
the
light
theres
a
beautiful
deep
mahogany
color
slight
peated
malt
aromasome
smokiness
and
sweetness
to
it
mellow
roasted
malt
flavor
some
buttery
and
treacle
notes
very
faint
peated
flavor
as
well
nice
little
astringency
that
works
great
balance
overall
between
the
flavors
good
body
very
very
drinkable
i
was
looking
at
the
brewerys
web
sites
and
fans
can
post
thoughts
on
their
beers
this
one
is
a
real
favorite
and
now
one
of
mine
i
need
to
hurry
up
and
get
back
to
scotland

not
very
sweet
mouthfeel

but
could
have

fuller
moderate
roasty
aftertaste
all
in

an
enjoyable
brew
other
notes
include
a
taste
that
was
not
too
sweet
as
many
of
the
scotish
entries
can
be
and
a
good
lingering
of
the
earthy
swill
in
the
aftertaste
rises
up
more
sharp
the
dusty
and
peated
with
even
some
rhubarb
and
chicory
notes
the
taste
is
an
intense
smokiness
of
sweet
oatmeal
dry
hops
finish
out
the

mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin

i
gave
it

the

pelting
your

as

a
warm
smile
lifts
your
spirits
thinking
of
this
one
waiting
inside
the

too
bad
the

carry
it
p

this
might
be
better
considered

i
never
like
the
aroma
of
scottish
styled
ales
but
like
all
others
there
is
a
strong
malty
butterscotchlike
scent
the
flavor
is
malty
caramel
and
butterscotchlike
as
well
the
carbonation
is
light
and
the
body
is
heavy
i
like
these
attributes
in
stronger
beers
enjoyable
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
scottish

founders

this

it

it

has

nothing

an

need
to

im

of

especially
for
their
barrelaged
program
and
i
have
friends
who
rave
about
slainte
but
i
do
not
like
this
brew
nothing
about
this
beer
is
out
of
line
all
perfect
to
style
at
least
for
me
and
right
on
point
for
where
a
scotch

should
be

sweetness

backbone
with
the
right
bite
in
toward
the

the
aroma
is
mildly
toffeeish
with
a
wisp
of
molasses
the
texture
is
airly
robust
even
for
a
scottish
ale
a
sip
can
be
a
mouthful
the
overall
taste
has
both
the
sweet
bitter
of
burnt

in

substantial
i
had
to
look

very

one
of
my
favorites
of
the
style
o
this
beer
seems
to
be
very
easy
to
drink
for
a
scottish
ale
but
is
rather
easy
to
drink
i
found
it
to
be
enjoyable
overall
this
is
a
fine
scottish
ale
one
of
the
best
ive
tried
the
presentation
and
complexity
are
both
excellent
a
more
robust
body
would
really
elevate
this
brew
to
the
next
level
this
beer
i
could
recognise
three
facets
to
the
flavor
sweet
to
start
nice
bite
to
dry
the
sweetness
in
the
middle
and
a
huge
flavor
in
the
end
that
gains
clarity
from
the
dry
middle
best
scottish
ale
ive
had
recommendation
one
more
for
the
malt
lover
and
much
fresher
than
any
import
you
can
find
on
the
shelf
at
any
liquor
store
if
you
see
it
grab
it
overall
one
of
the
better
scottish
ales
ive
had
as
it
is
not
cloyingly
sweet
the
bitterness
helps
to
balance
out
the
sweet
malt
im
a
fan
of
cws
satin
solsticesolitude
imperial
stout
but
i
like
this
even
more
excellent
effort
the
central
waters
scottish
ale
is
decent
and
worth
a
try
the
beer
poured
a
deep
amber
almost
opaque
with
thin
head
that
left
a
little
lacing
the
scent
carried
earth
peat
and
some
malt
the
taste
had
a
nice
malt
base
with
a
slight
roast
and
earth
the
mouthfeel
was
fuller
in
body
with
smooth
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
decent
scotch
ale
o
central
waters
sláinte
is
another
generously
malty
beer
that
exceeds
expectations
across
the
board
its
deep
and
complex
malt
aroma
is
the
perfect
usher
into
the
flavor
of
similar
malt
complexity
and
depth
all
while
remaining
balanced
and
smoothdrinking
alcohol
while
higher
in
content
is
almost
undetectable
in
this
smooth
beer
making
it
a
lovely
winter
warmer
look
is
a
dark
ruby
with
translucent
edges
smell
is
light
chocolate
and
butterscotch
malts
taste
is
similar
to
the
smell
with
butterscotch
and
chocolate
but
mostly
sweet
malts
with
a
touch
of
dark
fruit
the
hops
are
english
and
bitter
o
overall
this
is
a
very
good
scotch
ale
maybe
it
is
a
matter
of
preference
but
i
find
i
enjoy
more
of
the
dark
fruit
flavors
in
my
scotch
ales
all
said
this
at
7
5
abv
the
booze
is
not
immediately
present
overall
damn
i
cant
believe
this
isnt
a
regular
beer
on
the
lineup
such
a
smooth
malty
scotch
ale
worth
picking
up
if
you
find
it
verdict
a
decent
enough
beer
not
sure
its
a
decent
enough
scottish
ale
either
way
i
enjoyed
my
pint
but
i
doubt
id
ask
for
another
im
not
huge
on
the
start
of
this
but
the
finish
is
quite
nice
indeed
overall
not
bad
i
prefer
my
scottish
styles
a
touch
more
malty
overall
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
scotch
ales
but
this
is
a
good
one
too
bad
they
ran
out
of
the
barrel
aged
version
before
the
anniversary
party
becuase
i
would
have
loved
to
try
it
fun
times
at
all
those
fauxirish
bars
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
dark
garnetbrown
topped
by
a
finger
of
sandstone
foam
the
nose
comprises
mild
molasses
brown
sugar
light
cola
light
dark
fruits
and
a
pinch
of
chocolate
powder
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
a
stronger
contingent
of
fruits
definitely
in
the
figgy
vein
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
mildly
grainy
feel
overall
a
very
nice
scottish
ale
an
entertaining
and
enjoyable
beer
allaround
o
i
have
not
had
a
whole
lot
of
scottish
ales
but
this
brew
was
delicious
rich
sweet
malty
with
enough
smoke
and
heat
to
keep
you
warm
in
a
wisco
december
night
o
this
style
is
a
tough
sell
for
me
but
i
enjoyed
this
immensely
rich
malty
and
perfect
for
a
cold
evening
this
is
an
enjoyable
scottish
ale
its
a
little
less
intense
than
the
scotch
ales
i
enjoy
but
still
very
good
i
had
the
bourbon
barrel
aged
scotch
ale
at
the
central
waters
tap
room
back
in
october
and
it
was
outstanding
i
think
that
is
supposed
to
be
released
next
month
overall
another
solid
beer
from
central
waters
lots
of
complex
smells
and
flavors
done
in
a
true
scotch
ale
style
bottle
from
2011
summer
trip
this
style
is
hit
and
miss
for
me
this
version
is
a
winner
dark
brown
with
a
small
consistent
offwhite
head
and
some
lace
a
rich
yeast
malted
aroma
medium
mouthfeel
however
it
is
smooth
the
chocolate
the
smoke
the
malt
all
nicely
integrated
not
technically
a
sipper
but
one
youll
want
to
savor
nonetheless
fairly
complex
good
scotish
ale
central
waters
looking
forward
to
the
barrel
aged
version
this
one
was
memorable
for
all
the
tobacco
notes
in
it
overall
not
my
favorite
style
i
must
admit
but
this
one
is
enjoyable
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
a
rich
sweet
malty
beer
this
thing
was
pretty
awesome
it
didnt
offer
more
than
any
other
beers
of
the
same
style
but
it
was
very
solid
and
clean
o
not
the
most
potent
or
flavorful
beer
but
nicely
drinkable
for
a
malty
beer
a
decent
beer
but
nothing
about
it
impresses
me
i
can
drink
it
and
enjoy
it
but
its
not
whispering
or
shouting
to
me
that
i
need
to
drink
more
of
it
so
i
probably
wont
toasty
roasty
and
dry
dark
palate
biscuits
pumpernikel
crust
brownie
powder
and
faint
coffee
grounds
theres
a
yeasty
fruity
sweetness
underneath
everything
maybe
plums
or
prunes
dry
but
still
oily
palate
overall
very
good
full
flavor
ale
im
glad
central
waters
is
available
in
il
o
this
flavor
in
a
thicker
better
smelling
beer
would
be
amazing
as
it
stands
still
solid
o
the
nice
malt
flavor
is
not
real
rich
but
nice
and
it
would
be
nice
to
have
more
of
it
in
the
nose
the
bitterness
is
a
bit
too
strong
but
not
offensive
by
any
means
this
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
color
the
head
is
half
an
inch
in
height
and
recedes
quickly
into
sparse
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
caramel
toffee
perfume
and
peat
the
taste
is
a
nice
malty
balance
of
toffee
caramel
and
hints
of
peaty
perfume
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumfull
bodied
with
lively
carbonation
and
a
velvety
texture
overall
this
is
one
of
the
better
scottish
ales
ive
tasted
i
can
see
myself
drinking
this
beer
regularly
o
not
very
familiar
with
the
style
and
wouldnt
be
a
go
to
by
any
means
but
this
is
a
awesome
beer
will
have
to
pick
up
more
of
this
since
its
a
seasonal
d
a
solidly
executed
scottish
ale
i
had
no
problem
finishing
a
12oz
bottle
on
my
own
and
id
gladly
drink
another
love
the
affordable
wisconsin
price
point
too
probably
not
a
big
enough
beer
to
benefit
from
barrelaging
though
overall
nice
smooth
scottish
ale
with
almost
a
belgian
dark
ale
twist
on
the
front
end
of
the
beer
enjoyable
and
a
great
offering
cost
8
99
for
a
six
pack
o
i
enjoyed
this
beer
it
reminds
me
of
a
double
marzen
lacking
the
smokiness
i
like
with
some
scotch
ales
but
not
a
bad
thing
with
this
one
i
dont
think
this
fits
the
style
real
well
but
it
is
an
enjoyable
malt
heavy
beer
a
real
nice
winter
beer
that
isnt
overly
high
in
abv
i
think
this
would
be
a
nice
candidate
for
cw
barrel
aging
program
could
be
a
backwoods
bastard
type
beer
ill
keep
my
fingers
crossed
an
excellent
scottish
ale
from
one
of
new
favorite
breweries
it
pours
nice
and
black
with
a
little
head
and
a
little
lacing
the
smell
and
taste
are
both
rich
and
smoky
with
chocolate
and
peat
notes
an
excellent
sipper
for
a
cold
nice
almost
taste
like
a
stout
or
extra
rich
porter
o
4
5
not
always
in
the
mood
for
a
scottish
ale
granted
but
what
a
fine
example
this
is
i
might
turn
up
the
hops
and
peat
the
slightest
fraction
of
a
degree
and
add
some
chew
but
then
perfection
would
be
the
result
o
another
terrific
offering
from
this
sleeper
sconnie
brewery
im
a
confirmed
hophead
but
thought
id
try
a
scotch
ale
on
a
chilly
wisconsin
night
and
im
glad
i
did
this
is
one
big
sweet
malty
complex
beverage
and
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
it
thank
you
central
waters
and
slainte
to
you
this
beer
had
a
nice
dark
pour
and
the
bitter
slightly
sour
taste
that
i
expected
and
like
from
a
scotch
ale
there
was
also
a
subtle
sweet
aftertaste
that
i
enjoyed
this
one
seemed
to
lack
a
little
bit
of
the
kick
that
i
like
from
the
lake
louie
offerings
so
hopefully
my
score
reflects
that
i
like
this
beer
but
not
as
much
as
its
competitor
o
for
a
muchdebated
style
its
pretty
good
a
maltier
boozier
bitter
it
scratches
the
itch
and
is
a
very
very
drinkable
beer
for
a
very
very
agreeable
price
o
admittedly
scottish
ales
are
not
one
of
my
favorite
styles
but
i
tend
to
enjoy
most
central
waters
offerings
having
said
all
of
that
i
still
found
this
to
be
just
okay
i
would
not
likely
seek
this
one
out
again
velvety
smooth
feel
wisps
of
peat
smoke
and
woody
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
with
some
light
malt
sweetness
up
front
some
fruity
yeast
lends
indistinct
grape
or
currant
notes
finishes
fairly
dry
and
woody
not
too
sweet
overall
really
enjoyable
stuff
will
look
for
more
while
its
in
season
this
is
another
fine
addition
to
an
already
proven
lineup
of
brews
offered
by
the
crew
at
cw
this
is
one
i
hope
they
keep
putting
up
on
the
shelves
here
in
central
wisconsin
overall
i
was
surprised
by
how
much
scotch
ale
type
flavor
this
beer
has
with
the
low
alcohol
i
expected
a
much
lighter
beer
but
this
has
tons
of
flavor
it
could
use
a
bit
more
hop
flavor
but
its
such
a
small
issue
this
is
a
sessionable
beer
with
a
huge
amount
of
flavor
im
a
huge
fan
im
hoping
central
waters
decides
to
turn
this
up
a
couple
notches
and
make
a
full
on
scotch
ale
maybe
even
something
bourbon
barrel
aged
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
by
central
waters
ive
never
seen
this
one
before
but
its
definitely
worth
a
try
its
got
more
flavor
than
most
scottish
ales
ive
had
before
and
its
more
smooth
as
well
probably
one
of
the
worst
scotch
ales
ive
ever
had
not
nearly
as
strong
in
flavor
like
some
of
the
best
o
a
good
representation
of
the
style
which
i
was
just
reading
about
in
all
about
beer
magazine
might
have
a
fuller
body
but
certainly
has
some
good
malt
flavor
with
a
dark
fruit
tinge
cask
pour
in
a
tumbler
pint
the
beer
is
a
slightly
hazed
bright
rubycopper
coloring
with
a
frothy
filmy
clingy
offwhite
head
aromas
of
scotch
and
caramel
sweetness
with
a
subtle
roasting
tangy
sweet
flavors
of
scotch
and
floral
thistle
with
a
boozey
highlight
very
smooth
across
the
palate
with
a
clean
hoppy
bitterness
at
the
end
rich
smooth
feel
across
the
mouth
with
a
slightly
scotchy
and
sweet
aftertaste
smooth
clean
slightly
drying
finish
tasty
brew
malty
sweetness
all
over
with
some
candied
fruit
in
the
middle
and
cocoa
and
a
big
herbal
bitter
in
back
hoppy
for
a
scottish
ale
but
it
fits
from
the
12
fl
oz
bottle
with
an
expiration
date
of
dec
12
sampled
on
april
26
2012
it
pours
a
handsome
looking
deep
amber
with
little
to
no
head
which
tends
to
disappoint
me
the
aroma
has
a
pleasant
malt
sweetness
to
it
some
yeast
with
a
bit
of
bread
the
body
is
in
the
medium
range
or
maybe
just
a
bit
under
the
taste
is
upfront
sweet
and
malty
with
licorice
and
a
moderate
bitterness
it
ends
offdry
this
is
an
adequate
take
on
the
style
o
certainly
not
what
i
expected
not
bad
but
like
i
said
a
little
too
fruity
in
the
nose
and
not
enough
smoke
in
the
taste
makes
this
a
little
disappointing
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
very
refreshing
as
well
as
drinkable
great
session
beer
o
this
used
to
be
better
it
seemed
more
complex
when
ive
had
it
before
still
good
just
not
stellar
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
slightly
filling
decent
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
decent
beer
to
drink
for
a
long
time
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
the
style
d
scotch
scottish
ales
are
my
favorite
style
and
i
find
grittys
to
be
a
very
underrated
brewery
unfortunately
the
combination
doesnt
work
for
me
in
this
instance
this
one
is
still
average
and
drinkable
but
a
slight
disappointment
for
both
the
style
and
the
brewery
drink
is
decent
light
minerality
and
herbal
hops
dry
finish
fairly
bitter
d
a
beer
this
good
practically
begs
to
be
continued
to
drink
decent
for
a
scottish
ale
but
pemaquid
remains
my
goto
picked
this
up
thinking
it
was
a
new
beer
but
i
think
just
the
packaging
is
new
looks
alright
for
starters
brown
in
color
nice
foamy
head
pretty
standard
not
much
at
all
going
on
in
terms
of
aroma
faint
toffee
notes
malt
goes
downhill
fast
sort
of
buttery
and
not
much
balance
muddy
malt
lacks
any
sort
of
character
that
good
scotch
ales
do
no
nutty
smoky
etc
kind
of
carboardy
and
just
bland
and
watery
leads
to
not
such
a
satisfying
beer
i
have
to
say
this
is
not
a
good
representation
of
the
generally
good
beers
that
grittys
can
churn
out
pass
and
get
the
pale
bitter
stout
or
halloween
ale
instead
o
decent
brew
but
wont
be
seeking
it
out
poured
into
a
sam
adams
perfect
pint
glass
this
beer
pours
an
amber
brown
color
with
a
creamy
white
head
that
goes
away
pretty
quickly
there
is
no
real
lacing
on
this
beer
just
a
small
ring
around
the
edge
of
the
liquid
also
it
has
very
good
clarity
smell
is
good
not
great
but
good
actually
when
cool
it
really
doesnt
have
much
of
a
smell
at
all
after
it
warms
up
a
bit
the
nose
gets
a
bit
stronger
its
big
on
the
malts
very
sweet
even
a
little
rich
the
taste
is
a
step
up
again
its
very
malty
caramelized
with
a
bit
of
a
butterscotch
flavor
it
doesnt
taste
very
hoppy
maybe
a
little
bit
of
a
citrus
hop
flavor
but
it
unquestionably
targets
your
bitter
taste
buds
the
mouthfeel
is
excellent
creamy
and
smooth
with
a
clean
bitter
finish
no
carbonation
bite
at
all
full
bodied
and
well
balanced
overall
this
beer
has
good
drinkability
overall
i
would
certainly
get
it
again
if
the
opportunity
arose
this
beer
wont
blow
you
away
but
its
pretty
unique
for
this
style
a
great
scottish
ale
almost
as
good
as
callys
smokin
scottish
ale
d
a
pretty
good
scotch
ale
id
like
the
opportunity
to
try
it
on
tap
to
compare
maybe
a
bit
bland
compared
to
some
other
scotch
ales
but
overall
it
was
good
everything
seems
middle
of
the
road
with
this
brew
while
glad
for
a
new
brew
if
i
ever
make
it
to
grittys
ill
pass
on
this
one
loved
all
of
the
previous
offerings
from
this
brewery
this
one
didnt
really
do
it
for
me
to
be
honest
pours
a
nice
cloudy
red
color
small
head
minimal
lacing
medium
body
to
it
some
caramel
aroma
notes
taste
is
a
bit
watery
and
dont
get
a
lot
of
the
peatsmokey
flavor
or
even
that
much
caramel
in
the
taste
when
i
get
a
scotch
ale
thats
what
i
expect
but
this
one
is
a
bit
lacking
good
try
gm
but
ill
pass
on
this
scottish
ale
in
the
future
not
a
bad
beer
overall
though
very
easy
drinking
quite
tasty
but
not
really
quite
having
all
of
the
elements
of
a
top
notch
scottish
ale
most
notably
the
smokypeaty
character
associated
with
the
style
a
quality
brew
that
ill
be
happy
to
have
again
upon
occasion
cheers
this
is
only
the
second
scottish
ale
ive
tried
the
other
being
a
little
too
strong
in
taste
for
me
grittys
however
was
very
drinkable
paired
this
one
with
some
bread
and
sharp
cheddar
cheese
which
actually
brought
out
a
little
bit
of
sweet
malty
flavor
in
the
beer
alcohol
content
isnt
too
noticeable
and
it
isnt
as
heavy
as
i
expected
but
still
an
enjoyably
rich
taste
got
me
interested
in
trying
some
other
scottish
ales
a
dark
caramel
color
with
a
thick
offwhite
head
and
great
thick
lacing
the
aroma
is
a
mild
nutty
grass
hops
and
cider
the
taste
is
smooth
malt
and
sharp
pine
hops
a
crisp
but
somewhat
full
mouth
feel
its
a
decent
drinker
for
the
style
doesnt
seem
too
strong
in
alcohol
i
pick
up
some
sour
apple
and
lemon
rye
and
peat
very
enjoyable
perhaps
the
best
grittys
i
ever
had
be
sure
to
try
it
d
a
little
more
alcoholic
than
i
remember
this
being
great
starting
beer
also
great
to
keep
you
warmer
int
he
winter
months
i
always
give
it
a
try
when
i
comes
out
here
in
maine
around
this
time
of
year
a
big
beer
that
for
me
would
start
a
session
but
i
would
move
on
after
one
drinkability
a
nice
winter
beer
i
would
definitely
get
this
beer
again
overall
not
too
bad
has
some
really
great
elements
and
some
weak
ones
as
well
alcohol
is
present
but
not
too
in
your
face
worth
a
try
and
was
worth
the
purchase
of
a
single
dark
amber
colored
ale
with
a
rapidly
fading
head
aroma
is
buttery
caramel
taste
is
caramel
or
perhaps
butterscotch
this
is
something
i
could
see
myself
buying
again
i
would
recommend
to
my
buddies
nothing
overly
great
but
a
pretty
damn
good
drinkable
ale
good
drinkability
and
overall
an
above
average
scottish
well
done
not
top
of
the
heap
but
quality
the
drinkability
is
just
fine
a
very
well
dome
brew
that
drinks
agreat
prosit
mk
just
got
this
on
the
holiday
weekend
pours
dark
amber
nice
head
about
34
inch
with
lacing
smell
of
carmel
and
a
little
hops
it
has
a
very
nice
taste
and
flavor
feels
very
refreshing
in
your
mouth
and
is
easy
to
drink
and
one
leads
to
another
this
is
a
very
nice
scottish
style
ale
and
i
will
revisit
again
for
sure
wish
it
was
a
little
easier
to
get
but
a
good
taste
and
good
price
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
scottish
ale
is
my
fourth
gritty
mcduffs
beer
and
is
my
fourth
solid
gritty
mcduffs
beer
this
brewery
isnt
likely
to
be
anyones
alltime
favorite
apologies
if
it
is
but
id
love
to
live
within
their
distribution
area
thanks
to

take
a

more
if
i
had
them
thats
for

this
beer
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
short
and
medium
bodied
tan
head
that
sticks
around
and
laces
the
glass
on
the
way
down
the
aroma
is
of
sweet
malts
some
nice
hoppy
bitter
aromas
and
then
some
scotch
in
there
as
well
the
taste
is
of
very
nice
sweet
roasted
malts
some
scotch
flavoring
and
then
a
nice
bitter
hit
at
the
end
from
the
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
kind
of
refreshing
making
it
a
drinkable
beer
i
was
hoping
for
something
a
little
less
bitter
more
scotchy
and
smoother
feeling
a
solid
beer
overall
poured

i
like
this
better
than
most
scottish
ales
i
have
tried
but
is
not
one
of
my
favorites
from
this
brewery
drinks
okay
nothing
special
here
poured

somewhat
citrusy

finish
everyone
needs
to
remember
scottish
not
scotch
ale
mouthfeel
is
good
and
drinkability
is
great
i
enjoy
most
any
gritty
brew
and
this
one
fits
the
bill
as
well
dark
brownsligtly
amber
color
cola
fizz
of
a
head
with
zero
lace
smell
of
some
biscuit

and
not
much
else
taste
gets
more
interesting
with
a
solid
malty
base
with
some
biscuit
and
caramel
maltyness
a
surprizing
bitterness
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
a
little
to
high
on
the
carbonation
side
a
solid
session
brew
that
was
enjoyable
d
the
ale
works
as
a
sessioner
decent
taste
and
not
much
alcohol
but
if
you
are
looking
for
something
deeper
pass
on
this
d
very
solid
scottish
style
ale
with
a
good
amount
of
hops
and
flavors
to
keep
it
interesting
carbonation
is
pretty
heavy
but
it
doesnt
detract
from
the
overall
aesthetic
i
enjoyed
this
brew
very
much
obviously
contractbottled
by
shipyard
not
a
bad
effort
but
i
can
name
better
efforts
will
look
for
this
in
a
bomber
though
as
i
hear
bombers
are
better
quality
unless
they
wont
be
available
in
bombers
i
was
a
little
disappointed
in
the
bottle
i
had
this
from
the
brewpub
and
lets
say
it
tastes
a
lot
different
but
still
an
interesting
beer
none
the
less

the
beer
pours
a

a

slowly
fades
to

the
aroma
is

it

a
mild
malt
scent
that
boasts
of
crystal
and
roasted
malts
its
dry
with
some
sweetness
the
taste
is
average
also
it
has
a
dry
malty
taste
that
seems
watered
down
even
at
6
3
it
has
a
very
light
peated
flavor
along
with
an
alcohol
zing
the
mouthfeel
is
average
as
well
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
has
got
to
be
the
least
enjoyable
scottish
ale
ive
ever
had
it
lacks
depth
in
the
malt
bill
it
lacks
body
and
it
lacks
aroma
down
the
drain
it
goes
feels
thick
like
a
porter
rich
and
leaves
a
film
a
little
bubbly
and
thicker
than
it
looks
its
not
amazing

definitely
decent

trait
i

from
scottish

is
a
fresh

wortlike
flavor
and
aroma
that
is
robust

upfront
the

an

work
as

this

substantial
this
is
one
of

a

beer
weighs
a

heavy
but
pretty
tasty
nice
looking
brew
from
grittys
as
it
poured
to
a
amber
color
that
seems
to
have
brown
highlights
a
fair
sized
head
is
present
slight
tan
color
which
breaks
down
somewhat
quickly
but
is
not
leaving
much
of
any
lacing
also
noticed
this
with
the
last
one
that
i
had
a
couple
of
nights
ago
the
aroma
is
malt
caramel
in
scent
maybe
some
citrus
in
there
as
well
not
a
bad
smelling
brew
but
not
the
most
inviting
scottish
ale
i
have
had
the
feel
is
relatively
smooth
with
tastes
of
roasted
malt
being
dominant
slight
hop
bite
at
the
end
that
seems
to
be
somewhat
muted
but
finish
nicely
seems
to
have
more
flavors
coming
out
as
the
brew
warms
a
bit
a
somewhat
earthy
tone
over
all
it
is
a
fair
brew
but
not
one
to
rush
out
and
get
a
good
offering
in
the
12
pack
gritty
dozen
overall
a
damn
fine
scottish
ale
in
all
regards
except
for
its
staying
power
with
warmth
air
im
not
saying
to
chug
it
but
sippingnursing
it
does
not
help
nor
do
it
justice
however
there
are
far
worse
things
in
the
world
than
a
beer
that
appeals
to
all
senses
and
can
just
be
enjoyed
without
much
thought
over
a
session
one
after
the
other
perhaps
one
of
the
biggest
sleepers
in
the
new
england
market
by
all
means
check
it
out
enjoy
it
while
its
here
before
the
bagpipes
call
it
away
for
another
year
dnice
ale
but
it
reminded
me
of
an
esb
brewed
with
crystal
120
it
was
too
bitter
and
pale
to
be
scottish
ale
but
they
can
call
it
what
ever
they
want
the
bottom
line
is
this
is
very
drinkable
and
i
enjoyed
it

for
the

not
the
best
scottish
ale
ive
had
its
a
good
one
from
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
ill
be
having
this
one
again
sure
overall
a
decent
ale
nothing
great

1st
from

with
some
diacetyl
and
light

sweet
and
bright
on
the
tongue
at
first
though
thankfully
a
darker
maltiness
attempts
to
chase
down
the
sweetness
some
light
esters
show
up
as
well
smooth

not
bad
i
found
this
very
enjoyable
really
nice

good

balance
in
the
finish
leaves
a
slight
bitter
aftertaste
which
is
enjoyable
drinkability
is
ok
on
tap
i
might
be
inclined
to
have
more
than
12
at
home
i
will
probably
reach
for
something
else
from
the
mix
pack
i
found
this
in
well
not
what
you
would
expect
a
scottish
ale
to
be
pours
dark
brown
a
little
of
a
head
not
much
smell
a
bit
sweet
tastes
somewhat
malty
with
quite
a
bit
of
hops
for
a
scottish
ale
overall
not
bad
but
not
overly
exciting
either
good
way
to
introduce
people
to
darker
beers
pours
a
rich
brown
in
color
that
is
absolutely
clear
thick
white
head
that
dissolves
into
a
thin
film
nose
is
sweet
caramel
with
just
a
hint
of
hops
flavor
is
fairly
straightforward
sweet
at
first
with
a
bit
more
hop
bitterness
towards
the
finish
got
some
caramel
kind
of
an
apple
thing
going
on

i
wonder
how
this
would
be
on
cask
nice
and
drinkable
somehow
this
tastes
the
same
as
best
brown
and
best
bitter
variations
on
the
same
lackluster
theme
strangely
i
could
imagine
several
hours
of
darts
or
pool
while
swigging
this
and
bsing
with
the
guys
overall
id
drink
another
one
if
offered
but
i
wouldnt
necessarily
go
out
of
my
way
to
track
one
down
grittys
has
come
out
with
combo
12
packs
this
one
had
scottish
ale
christmas
ale
and
the
yearround
pub
ale
this
scottish
ale
is
very
good
it
had
a
nice
amber
color
with
minimal
head
and
i
really
tried
to
make
so0me
head
when
pouring
it
has
a
spicysweet
aroma
and
a
good
cinnamonmalty
taste
with
a
hoppy
aftertaste
that
really
lingers
lightly
carbonated
so
good
mouthfeel
a
very
drinkable
beer
pours
a
solild
copper
to
amber
color
with
a
small
head
that
falls
to
a
sparse
coat
over
top
small
bubbles
slowly
form
at
the
bottom
of
the
glass
and
float
up
nose
is
nice
and
butter
to
toffee
with
a
lot
of
caramel
sweetness
a
bit
too
buttery
for
me
flavor
is
better
than
the
nose
buttery
diacetyl
is
still
there
but
i
get
some
moderte
herbal
hopping
with
a
moderate
hop
bitter
finish
also
good
caramel
sweetness
not
quite
what
i
expect
from
my
scottish
ales
id
like
some
peaty
or
smokey
character
and
not
with
the
hops
feel
is
moderate
with
a
full
moderate
carbonation
the
hopping
is
really
not
working
with
me
on
this
one
it
should
be
more
sweet
and
with
some
peaty
or
smokey
phenols
just
okay
the
smoky
character
teams
up
well
with
the
hops
and
malt
although
i
would
have
liked
a
bit
more
body
overall
this
a
decent
scottish
ale
with
respectable
complexity
im
not
usually
a
big
fan
of
the
grittys
line
of
beers
but
this
one
caught
my
interest
pours
with
a
real
orangeredamber
color
and
a
decent
enough
head
has
a
nice
classic
ale
style
nose
and
taste
with
ample
bitterness
on
the
finish
it
could
have
had
a
little
bigger
mouthfeel
but
all
in
all
a
damn
fine
winter
brew
mouthfeel
is
crisp
at
the
start
and
finish
while
the
finish
has
a
soft
buttery
caramel
aftertaste
medium
bodied
nice
drinkability
i
often
question
the
freshness
of
many
maine
beers
when
people
buy
them
in
singles
or
sixers
at
their
local
market
whilst
i
am
suer
that
the
further
north
you
go
the
better
your
chance
of
getting
fresh
product
is
for
me
in
pa
anything
that
we
get
is
questionable
at
best
i
learned
a
lot
about
maine
beer
on
my
trip
to
portland
at
the
end
of
february
but
the
main
thing
is
this
maine
beer
needs
to
be
drunk
fresh
from
the
tap
sorry
about
that
little
rant
but
this
beer
is
no
exception
to
the
above
rule
i
had
this
on
tap
at
several
portlandarea
beer
bars
its
a
nice
ruddy
brown
colour
that
is
not
opaque
but
is
almost
black
their
are
some
red
highlights
though
if
you
look
at
this
one
closely
the
head
is
small
and
consists
of
thick
whiteish
foam
lacing
is
there
but
minimal
in
nature
the
aromas
of
this
brew
are
classic
uk
scotch
ale
big
beefy
malts
and
a
big
sweetnes
are
barely
balanced
by
some
nice
leafy
uk
hop
variatels
taste
is
malty
and
sweet
with
some
nice
smokyoakyscotchy
notes
that
are
there
but
partially
hidden
by
the
huge
maltiness
of
this
brew
mouthfeel
is
medium
modiedthick
and
drinkability
is
very
good
a
very
solid
example
of
this
style
done
up
right
by
one
of
the
best
breweries
that
maine
has
to
offer
dont
take
this
place
for
granted
all
you
maine
bas
this
is
a
good
scottish
ale
and
one
of
my
favorite
styles
this
time
of
year
there
are
much
better
beers
of
this
style
out
there
but
this
one
is
solid
another
great
beer
from
this
fine
brewer
chestnut
colored
with
a
fat
and
foamy
and
somewhat
lumpy
offwhite
head
that
lingers
long
thick
rings
of
foam
and
spotty
lace
line
the
glass
as
i
drink
aroma
is
light
and
consists
of
sweet
malt
and
some
hops
very
smooth
and
creamy
mouthfeel
followed
by
a
sweet
malt
flavor
upfront
with
toffee
and
caramel
plus
some
hops
in
the
finish
light
brown
sugar
emerges
in
the
aftertaste
veeeery
drinkable
notes
a
nice
beefy
scottish
ale
reminds
me
of
some
of
the
strong
scottish
bitters
i
had
many
years
ago
in
edinburgh
a
stogy
beef
stew
would
be
a
great
pairing
with
this
one
strong
malt
aroma
poured
an
ambercopper
with
a
nice
decent
sized
head
taste
was
malty
with
a
definite
alcohol
presence
initially
sweet
then
an
alcohol
bite
at
the
finish
had
a
somewhat
oily
mouthfeel
that
was
medium
bodied
ok
to
drink
one
but
id
rather
try
another
brew
oh
well
not
until
i
taste
it
bummer
maybe
its
just
the
sixer
that
i
bought
but
this
is
really
carbonated
light
in
body
like
light
dang
and
light
in
flavor
nothing
much
to
say
about
aftertaste
but
really
im
just
so
bummed
that
ive
got
a
whole
six
pack
of
this
to
drink
edit
ok
that
bomber
i
had
may
have
not
been
up
to
snuff
i
have
had
subsequent
6packs
that
have
been
much
more
flavorful
and
rich
still
not
fantastic
but
better
than
i
thought
before
the
tatse
is
a
major
letdown
very
unscot
like
some
decent
toasted
malt
and
caramel
up
front
but
the
ending
is
just
horrible
very
bitter
and
hopped
not
what
i
call
a
scotch
ale
by
any
stretch
medium
body
average
carbonation
overall
a
pretty
average
beer
not
a
bad
brew
but
a
bit
of
sharp
flavors
that
arent
balanced
i
think
the
alcohol
is
bit
too
much
present
pat
pretty
average
on
the
drinkability
stakes
could
have
been
a
lot
better
overall
a
drinkable
brew
im
not
so
sure
i
would
go
so
far
as
to
call
it
a
scotch
ale
to
me
a
scotch
ale
is
very
malty
with
some
alcohol
notes
and
not
much
hop
bitterness
this
was
more
like
a
dark
ipa
or
esb
to
me
but
to
be
honest
i
have
had
much
worse
that
was
called
a
scotch
ale

this
beer
is
very
smooth
and
for
a
darker
beer
it
does
not
have
the
heaviness
that
others
have
the
beer
is
full
of
flavors
a
great
beer
possibly
my
favorite
i
love
this
one
any
its
petty
easy
to
get
in
my
area
loads
of
flavor
caramel
and
sugar
strong
hints
of
toasty
bread
i
love
scotch
ales
and
this
one
goes
down
very
nicely
having
had
this
fantastic
scottish
ale
in
bottle
form
the
tap
version
is
just
as
good
if
not
better
pours
a
deep

with
light
quickly
dissipating
head
that
leaves
light
white
lacing
smell
of
caramel
toffee
fresh

with
a
light
peat
smell
taste
is
excellent
with
rich
caramel
malts
and
peat
malt
shinning
through
silky
smooth
mouthfeel
refreshing
for
a
beer
coming
in
at
a
higher
abv
light
toffee
taste
in
the
back
with
caramel
malts
and
almost
zero
bittering
hops
excellent
as
always
and
one
i
would
suggest
to
turn
newbie
beer
lovers
onto
as
well
as
the
experienced
beer
nut
cheers
overall
very
good
interpretation
of
the
style
the
flavors
and
body
make
this
one
of
the
most
drinkable
malty
beers
on
the
market
i
poured
this
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
45
degrees
this
was
a
hard
beer
to
rate
i
had
one
the
night
before
and
rated
it
yuk
i
had
two
more
to
drink
and
liked
them
so
i
guess
i
got
a
bad
one
and
for
that
reason
had
to
do
a
split
decision
here
the
beer
looked
like
gas
poured
a
weak
head
that
was
tan
the
beer
smelled
sour
the
first
one
and
tasted
sour
next
two
next
night
did
not
i
uess
i
would
try
it
again
overall
this
is
a
good
example
of
a
scottish
ale
the
sweet
toffee
and
mineral
characters
are
great
while
the
beer
is
light
enough
to
drink
in
droves
the
only
detractor
for
me
was
the
leather
like
quality
in
the
aroma
overall
what
this
lacks
in
flavor
it
makes
up
for
in
drinkability
not
something
i
would
really
pick
up
again
but
a
pleasure
to
drink
the
one
i
had
strong
but
i
consider
it
a
session
brew
ideally
when
youve
got
some
cheese
and
meats
around
for
buffering
the
stomach
and
not
getting
too
warped
o
overall
a
great
beer
and
one
of
my
favorite
offering
from
erie
brewing
will
always
seek
this
out
when
the
goal
is
to
get
bent

when

definitely
give
this
a
try
but
if
your
heart
is
set
on
the
typical
scottish
ale
but
it
was
unusual
and
not
at
all
what
i
expected
for
a
scottish
ale
i
downgraded
it
for
missing
the
mark
for
its
style
i
upgraded
the
overall
score
because
i
liked
the
beer
even
though
it
tasted
more
like
a
bier

a

this

it
pours
a
nice
amber
color
with
an
off

that
trails

the
smell
has
a
bit
of
alcohol

underneath
is
a
lot
of
scents
vanilla
and
caramel
as
well
as
some
citrus
and
smoke
to
give
it
a
complex
smell
the
taste
was
just
as
layered
with
the
flavors
from
the
malt
and
the
hops
as
well
as
some
wood
on
the
finish
making
a
very
well
balanced
beer
one
of
my
favorite
growlers
to
pick
up
when
i
can
overall
another
poorly
done
beer
under
attenuated
and
left
to

conditioning
for
way
too
long
i
admit
its
probably
too
old

still
doesnt

done
ill

to
try
this

i
love

but
ill

to

on
this
part
of
it
nevertheless
will
probably
risk
buying
more
at
some
point
since
i
like
scottish
ales
and
this
is
supposed
to
be
a
good
one
clean
light
and
drinkable
no
hops
to
speak
of
a
speck
of
chocolate
malt
in
there
nothing
groundbreaking
but
simple
and
classy
overall
a
nice
and
sessionable
scotch
ale
that
hits
all
the
right
points
but
is
never
overbearing
i
could
have
several
pints
of
this
i
like
scotch
ales
and
have
had
several
so
this
is
above
average
compared
to
all
scotch

is

cheers

very

easy
on

highly
drinkable
scottish
ale
good
start
as
my
first
beer
from
this
brewery
wasnt
sure
of
the
style
when
i
tried
i
thought
it
was
a
solid
english
amber
ale
worth
a
try
if
nothing
better
around
decent
ale
and
you
can
tell
it
is
a
scottish
ale
poured
ontap
and
served
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
is
a
muddled
amberbrown
coloring
very
cloudy
to
the
point
of
being
opaque
no
head
on
the
pour
but
a
slight
ring
of
bubbling
was
present
the
beer
had
a
very
sweet
aroma
with
some
nut
and
coffee
bitterness
i
was
preparing
for
a
creamy
feel
but
surprisingly
enough
this
beer
is
a
bit
effervescent
and
bubbly
while
still
being
on
the
creamy
side
the
beers
flavors
are
toasty
with
chocolate
and
coffee
characteristics
in
the
forefront
the
beer
is
like
hershey
kisses
melted
in
a
cup
of
coffee
the
beer
is
light
and
the
aftertaste
is
chocolate
sweet
with
a
slight
lingering
finish
of
burnt
characteristics
d
an
average
at
best
scottish
ale
im
not
quite
sure
what
it
is
but
there
something
on
the
palette
that
is
bit
off
about
this
one
that
i
just
cant
get
by
there
arent
many
scottish
ales
that
ive
head
that
i
would
recommend
or
reinvest
in
but
unfortunately
this
is
one
of
them
pours
a
cloudy
copper
with
a
robust
head
good
retention
and
excellent
lacing
full
bodied
mouthfeel
smooth
start
to
finish
no
aftertaste
excellent
drinkability
will
have
to
look
out
for
this
again
beer
is
thinner
than
it
should
be
and
has
a
papery
cardboard
flavor
to
it
this
might
have
been
a
bad
fill
of
this
growler
the
toffee
notes
are
present
they
are
a
little
harsh
the
finish
has
an
unpleasant
aftertaste
perhaps
something
went
wrong
with
this
pours
a
light
copper
color
with
a
short
light
tan
head
and
a
spot
or
two
of
lacing
on
the
way
down
thin
color
throughout
the
nose
brings
some
light
oxiized
sherry
and
cherry
character
with
some
caramel
and
grainy
malt
flavor
brings
light
fruitiness
with
a
lot
of
grain
and
light
oxidation
medium
body
and
moderate
carbonation
not
a
big
fan
of
really
anything
with
this
beer
unfortunately
o
goes
tremendously
well
with
smoky
food
right
from
the
grill
this
has
been
my
goto
bbq
beer
for
years
now
looking
forward
to
the
bottle
of
tpa
reserve
i
bought
with
this
today
not
bad
at
all
one
of
the
best
tasting
prepackaged
growlers
i
have
had
sealed
very
well
unlike
some
i
have
purchased
definitely
worth
a
shot
if
you
find
it
on
tap
pours
a
dark
semi
translucent
dark
mahogany
color
with
a
half
inch
of
head
minimal
lacing
aroma
is
boozey
pepppery
bready
and
malty
flavor
is
malt
boozey
with
a
slight
bit
of
pepper
some
breadiness
as
well
as
some
caramel
a
bit
of
an
overall
sourness
to
this
one
this
is
a
solid
choice
for
a
drinkable
beer
which
is
helpful
because
i
usually
only
see
growlers
of
it
overall
its
a
good
local
beer
worth
having
again
i
tried
this
beer
on
a
whim
when
i
saw
it
at
the
local
liquor
store
very
impressed
this
beer
doesnt
look
like
much
but
has
a
very
unique
and
very
nice
powerful
taste
the
smell
is
almost
offputting
as
it
smells
very
pungent
almost
flowery
the
taste
however
is
amazing
strong
and
smooth
absolutely
worth
trying
i
had
this
on
tap
at
a
bar
in
waterbury
it
poured
a
very
nice
ruby
brown
with
a
decent
off
white
head
that
disappeared
quickly
the
smell
is
nice
real
caramel
malts
a
hint
of
pepper
and
a
bit
of
yeasty
bready
in
the
background
the
taste
is
more
of
the
same
the
caramel
malt
really
stands
out
and
that
is
a
good
thing
there
is
enough
hop
in
there
to
just
hold
the
malts
in
check
the
body
is
nice
and
creamy
with
low
carbonation
very
smooth
overall
a
malty
treat
this
is
not
true
to
style
but
is
a
very
good
beer
note
i
detect
some
resemblance
to
penny
weiz
ale
perhaps
they
use
the
same
yeast
d
nice
kick
nice
representation
of
style
not
too
filling
this
is
a
nice
beer
to
have
a
few
pints
for
an
evening
d
it
is
drinkable
but
the
style
gets
kinda
tired
after
one
what
is
kinda
cool
is
that
there
are
no
preservatives
in
this
guy
so
if
you
try
one
it
pretty
much
has
to
be
fresh
worth
trying
but
not
a
must
find
medium
bodied
good
carbonation
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
went
well
with
the
wings
just
found
my
notes
recently
from
last
summers
northwest
connecticut
brewfest
poured
dark
copper
with
a
finger
of
offwhite
head
good
retention
and
good
lacing
very
pleasant
and
pronounced
blend
of
coffee
caramel
and
cocoa
powder
in
the
nose
tasted
of
caramel
and
coffee
dissolving
to
more
maltiness
midpalate
and
finishing
on
a
smoky
note
nicely
smooth
not
overly
carbonated
medium
body
very
sessionable
and
one
of
my
few
repeat
table
visits
during
the
fest
d
at
first
i
said
forget
about
this
but
after
talking
with
other
folks
later
i
think
the
poor
performance
was
all
the
fault
of
the
serving
method
got
it
at
red
robin
and
the
tender
put
it
in
a
frosted
glass
im
betting
that
the
glass
was
poorly
rinsed
and
gained
a
lot
of
condensation
when
pulled
out
of
the
cooler
i
wanted
to
do
a
retest
before
leaving
new
england
but
it
just
wasnt
meant
to
be
so
take
my
review
with
a
grain
of
salt
all
in
all
i
do
recommend
this
beer
if
you
can
get
it
as
it
says
on
the
companys
website
it
doesnt
travel
well
since
it
is
unfiltered
and
contains
no
preservatives
those
of
us
lucky
enough
to
live
close
to
the
brewery
how
i
wish
we
could
have
gone
to
their
festival
yesterday
that
ended
in
an
overnight
camping
experience
can
enjoy
the
flavor
of
this
truly
wonderful
treat
drinkability
very
drinkable
ale
i
really
like
the
smoky
and
earthy
flavors
and
the
balancing
caramel
sweetness
great
beer
sweet
and
earthen
and
has
that
perfect
balance
of
complexity
and
accessibility
that
mark
my
favorite
beers
great
stuff
on
tap
at
flatbread
with
larsonstyle
the
bartender
told
me
they
kicked
a
hooker
tap
off
because
they
wanted
to
put
micro
brew
on
i
had
seen
this
one
at
the
brass
city
brewfest
but
didnt
get
the
opportunity
to
try
it
no
idea
what
to
expect
here
nice
dark
brown
color
with
some
serious
head
on
this
beer
smells
grainy
and
malty
tasted
kinda
smokey
rough
at
first
but
i
eased
into
it
it
has
a
very
nice
mouthfeel
strong
but
pronounced
i
really
like
how
this
one
goes
down
i
wanted
to
try
the
dirty
penny
next
but
it
seemed
there
was
a
problem
with
the
keg
as
the
head
was
unbelievable
i
thought
it
was
a
very
solid
offering
and
i
am
anxious
to
try
more
from
this
brewery
md
medium
bodied
good
carbonation
easy
drinking
could
easily
polish
of
a
growler
of
this
in
the
course
of
an
evening
i
am
very
impressed
different
from
most
scotch
ales
i
have
had
this
beer
has
it
all
i
must
have
bought
a
fresh
growler
because
a
small
ring
of
head
stayed
throughout
the
entire
pint
the
mouthfeel
was
excellent
lingering
for
a
while
after
after
the
first
pint
i
had
to
have
another
the
mixture
of
caramel
a
slight
smokiness
and
tinge
of
hop
lingering
was
just
too
good
i
cant
wait
to
try
another
style
from
this
brewery
soon
drinkability
i
usually
pick
up
a
growler
every
couple
of
weeks
of
this
goes
down
easy
its
enjoyable
the
taste
has
some
light
fruitiness
along
with
sweet
grain
and
a
very
light
caramel
finish
light
brown
sugar
and
a
very
slight
toast
are
found
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
light
with
high
carbonation
which
takes
away
from
the
flavor
of
the
beer
in
the
end
this
dulls
the
beer
down
a
bit
it
tastes
good
but
its
nothing
really
exciting
its
not
at
the
top
of
my
list
as
something
to
grab
but
i
enjoy
it
it
tastes
like
a
popcorn
ale
and
has
a
fruity
taste
of
bitter
citrus
and
then
some
malt
sourness
interesting
flavor
this
beer
is
an
unknown
at
my
work
obviously
it
can
be
a
little
ominous
or
intimidating
to
some
but
of
course
i
have
no
fear
in
trying
new
beers
i
took
this
bad
boy
home
and
quickly
opened
to
it
to
my
surprise
a
very
good
beer
was
inside
hey
im
kinda
rhyming
weird
anyway
this
beer
has
a
good
head
good
lacing
tastes
very
good
dont
go
drinking
it
in
all
at
once
now
ya
here
drinkability
i
could
drink
this
all
day
and
tried
to
once
i
dont
remember
much
except
it
was
the
best
tuesday
ever
im
kidding
but
seriously
this
is
so
smooth
i
literally
could
just
pound
it
back
all
day
not
a
care
in
the
world
nice
ontap
d
this
is
an
easy
drinking
ale
goes
down
easy
but
nothing
really
exciting
about
it
to
make
me
want
to
go
back
for

not
a

nice
to
have
had
a
chance
to
try
it
a
very
nice
beer
i
have
it
every
time
im
at
the
hartford
airport
wouldnt
mind
a
little
more
flavor
but
a
great
session
scottish
this
is
a
nice
easy
drinker
something
to
enjoy
on
a
hot
day
i
have
never
had
a
scotch
ale
and
i
was
expecting
more
of
a
whisky
taste
what
a
nice
surprise
a
very
refreshing
and
authentic
scottish
pint
well
done
was
glad
to
see
this
offered
at
t
pics
bar
in
waterbury
ct
soon
to
be
the
publick
house
go
there
poured
from
the
growler
into
a
pint
glass
this
one
showed
a
slightly
hazey
dark
iced
tea
color
with
a
modest
offwhite
head
and
fair
scattered
lacing
the
aroma
was
a
somewhat
malty
rye
a
touch
grassy
but
mild
and
mellow
pleasant
the
flavor
was
a
very
nice
blend
of
spicey
rye
and
mild
brown
sugar
malt
mild
but
effective
carbonation
in
a
medium
bodied
silky
feel
i
really
like
this
with
its
polite
hint
of
bitterness
somewhere
between
herbal
and
citrus
this
tasted
better
than
i
remember
it
from
the
tap
some
time
ago
so
i
will
be
sure
to
snag
a
growler
for
home
sometime
soon
well
done
drinkability
in
growler
form
ive
found
a
new
brew
that
is
oh
so
satisfying
i
love
how
the
maltiness
and
the
hops
cooperate
with
eachother
perfectly
to
shape
out
this
wonderful
treat
an
excellent
offering
from
a
local
brewer
and
i
will
definetley
have
to
pick
up
more
of
this
soon

this
could
be
a
good
go
to
beer
if
the
selection
isnt
that
great
which
in
this
case
it
wasnt
drinkable
didnt
seem
to
have
a
high
abv
at
all
i
wish
this
had
more
of
a
scent
to
it
there
are
a
ton
of
late
hop
additions
to
this
but
none
of
them
seem
to
contribute
any
aroma
but
then
again
maybe
thats
what
they
were
going
for
with
the
scotish
style
so
what
do
i
know
i
do
know
i
will
look
for
this
beer
and
other
by
olde
burnside
brewing
company
my
favorite
session
beer
crisp
clean
one
finger
head
that
stays
throughout
the
pint
malty
aroma
a
bit
smoky
a
citrusgrass
hop
note
the
body
was
average
for
the
style
with
light
carbonation
mouthfeel
was
average
but
if
it
was
90
degrees
out
the
mouthfeel
would
be
exceptional
very
well
balanced
i
had
no
problem
finishing
a
growler
and
a
half
this
is
what
i
reach
for
after
mowing
the
lawn
a
winner
in
my
book
ive
got
to
make
it
a
point
to
get
down
to
the
brewery
i
would
love
to
have
a
fresh
pint
pours
reddish
and
clear
with
a
lively
head
and
good
lacing
not
much
aroma
the
flavor
is
crisp
and
malty
with
a
slight
bitterness
there
is
relatively
little
in
the
way
of
finish
however
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
but
not
unpleasant
this
is
a
good
drinkable
beer
you
wont
be
disappointed
to
find
it
in
a
pub
somewhere
pours
a
clear
amber
color
with
a
one
finger
plus
white
head
that
has
good
retention
with
no
lacing
the
aroma
is
dominated
by
sweet
carmelized
malt
up
front
flavors
of
toasted
malt
and
smoke
lead
to
some
lemony
hops
with
chocolate
and
molasses
light
carbonation
medium
body
leaves
a
very
clean
crisp
mouthfeel
a
little
thin
for
the
style
but
it
works
the
malt
is
very
well
controlled
and
balanced
by
the
hops
there
are
so
many
different
flavors
too
often
the
smoke
takes
over
the
taste
of
this
style
not
here
amazing
drinkability
for
the
style
i
had
no
problem
finishing
this
growler
on
my
own
my
favorite
ct
beer
to
date
my
recommendation
is
this
drink
ten
penny
ale
because
the
rest
of
them
are
just
beer
hazy
orangebrown
color
with
a
nice
offwhite
tan
head
that
laces
the
glass
it
has
a
nice
roasted
malt
smell
with
some
hop
bitterness
the
flavor
is
pretty
good
it
tastes
of
roasted
malts
as
a
base
and
a
good
hop
bitterness
to
balance
out
the
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
good
with
a
nice
velvety
feel
and
a
bit
flatter
than
it
had
to
be
the
drinkability
is
pretty
good
though
i
like
this
beer
gotta
support
your
local
brewer
drinkability
flaws
aside
i
find
this
quite
drinkable
its
watery
mouthfeel
may
actually
help
one
polish
off
the
whole
growler
in
one
sitting
while
at
the
same
time
the
malty
aroma
and
multifaceted
taste
keep
you
interested
the
beer
pours
a
dark
golden
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
fruity
yeast
scent
along
with
a
mild
pale
and
light
crystal
malt
aroma
there
are
some
hops
in
there
as
well
the
taste
is
average
it
has
a
weak
and
watery
malt
flavor
there
appears
to
be
some
peated
malt
in
there
but
its
faint
the
hops
add
some
bitterness
but
not
enough
to
make
it
interesting
the
mouthfeel
is
average
as
well
it
is
a
low
bodied
beer
with
a
little
too
much
carbonation
this
is
a
forgettable
brew
i
wanted
to
like
it
but
its
just
not
very
good
this
beer
poured
a
clean
brown
with
a
thin
head
i
was
quite
impressed
the
aroma
smelled
of
cigarettes
butter
coffee
along
with
something
that
was
rather
funky
possibly
an
infection
there
was
an
earthy
still
funky
cigarettes
butter
and
infection
flavor
i
couldnt
get
past
the
funky
and
infected
flavor
enough
to
get
further
in
the
taste
evaluation
there
is
a
medium
to
full
body
but
again
i
couldnt
get
past
the
flavor
the
growler
may
not
have
been
clean
i
found
it
too
funky
to
be
enjoyable
maybe
i
can
review
it
again
and
be
more
positive
ten
penny
is
a
very
reliable
scoth
ale
and
always
available
in
growler
form
ive
had
it
ontap
and
its
pretty
much
on
par
but
i
prefer
the
former
definitely
recommended
d
one
of
these
is
interesting
enough
to
drink
but
thats
probably
enough
for
me
this
one
almost
has
potential
and
i
would
like
to
try
again
as
i
think
this
might
be
a
bad
batch
i
remember
having
it
at
a
beer
festival
in
new
york
city
and
liking
it
more
though
i
do
remember
it
being
a
bit
out
of
style
this
one
was
brought
to
me
by
friends
who
bought
it
cold
put
it
in
a
cooler
then
a
fridge
and
given
to
me
only
a
couple
days
later
the
chalky
character
was
relentless
this
is
the
second
time
i
had
a
ten
penny
ale
on
tap
the
first
time
i
had
it
i
thought
someone
made
a
mistake
when
storing
the
beer
having
it
a
second
time
at
adams
mill
restaurant
in
manchester
ct
i
realized
that
first
time
i
had
it
it
was
either
skunked
or
the
tap
lines
contaminated
anyways
this
beer
was
a
decent
all
around
brew
and
i
would
order
it
again
i
had
it
with
a
burger
and
it
paired
quite
nicely
however
this
beer
may
not
be
completely
loyal
to
its
style
i
found
there
to
be
more
hops
in
the
beer
than
i
feel
a
scottish
ale
should
have
however
for
my
personal
taste
i
enjoyed
it
if
rating
based
on
loyalty
to
style
alone
subtract
a
half
point
however
i
liked
it
good
session
beer
and
would
drink
it
again
m
a
bit
to
much
carbonation
and
no
mouth
to
watery
this
is
a
beer
you
could
easily
drink
all
night
and
is
great
for
a
group
who
may
not
like
more

a

the

sensation
i
get
from
this
is
a
dry

sticks

the

of
not

i
expected
an

quite
drinkable

overall
a

could
have
used
a
broader
grain
profile
in
my
opinion
d
this
beer
is
tasty
but
its
a
bit
filling
its
worth
drinking

personally
i
might
look
for
something
else
d
which
leads
to
a
great
drinkability
even
my

whos
a

likes

rate
the

had
my

pick
this
beer
up
for
me
while
he
was
visiting

at

the

the

my
first
beer
from
ct
reflection
scotch
ale
i
would
have
sworn
this
was
a
brown
ale
but
it
was
still
a
good
beer
and
worth
picking
up
i
was
a
little
surprised
to
find
a
growler
of
this
stuff
in
bbc
countrybut
nonetheless
i
decided
to
give
it
a
try
the
bottle
description
was
not
very
informative
only
after
i
looked
it
up
on
ba
did
i
find
out
what
specific
type
ale
it
was

smokiness
that
i
had

in

was

any

wont

any

about

othis

of
this
type
whether
that

whatever
on

side
this

does
provide

this
is
a
fair
representation
of
a
scottish

that
should
appeal
to
those
looking
for
something
with

and
with
little
stress
to
the
system
perfect
for
anytime
of
year
activity
or
food
i
purchased
this
at
a
local
beerwine
store
in
a
mixed
12
pack
the
label
indicates
it
was
bottled
in
late
october
and
it
is
now
december
19th
it
poured
a
dark
brown
clear
with
very
small
head
to
it
excellent
carbonation
with
a
nice
mouthfeel
to
it
i
find
it
on
the
thin
side
in
taste
as
i
was
hoping
for
a
more
robust
beer
however
it
definitely
has
roasty
malt
overtones
its
good
if
you
just
want
to
sit
back
and
watch
some
tv
but
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
pours
a
clear
brown
color
15
inch
head
of
a
white
color
slight
retention
and
poor
lacing
smells
of
caramel
malt
slight
earthy
malt
hint
of
nut
slight
chocolate
and
a
hint
of
grain
fits
the
style
of
a
scottish
ale
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
caramel
malt
sweet
malt
hint
of
earthy
malt
hint
of
chocolate
and
a
hint
of
grain
overall
poor
appearance
but
good
aroma
body
and
blend
atmosphere
is
good
nice
head
and
lacing
nose
is
sweet
and
grain
components
flavor
is
grain
and
sweet
but
has
a
synthetic
feel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
decent
quaff
mediumbodied
with
moderate
carbonation
not
nearly
as
boozy
as
i
am
used
to
for
the
style
but
thats
not
really
a
bad
thing
as
it
does
make
it
more
drinkable
i
wouldnt
have
more
than
one
but
i
can
see
the
appeal
of
this
one
try
it
once
and
see
what
you
think
o
consistently
good
local
brew
always
a
pleasant
treat
as
i
tend
to
pass
it
up
because
it
is
always
around
not
a
scotch
ale
as
i
am
used
to
having
them
but
distinct
in
its
own
way
pours
a
lighter
shade
of
brown
with
a
fair
head
nose
is
sweet
roasted
malts
and
a
hit
of
smoke
burnt
sugars
in
the
taste
this
is
a
very
very
sweet
beer
doesnt
quite
stack
up
to
the
best
scotch
ales
ive
enjoyed
but
a
decent
brew
nonetheless
has
a
nice
warming
effect
and
goes
will
with
just
about
anything
in
the
fridge
above
average
d
a
very
fine
example
of
the
style
nice
malty
and
simple
this
one
id
have
again
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
decent
beer
but
so
far
nothing
in
this
style
has
truly
inspired
me
on
tap
at
springs
orleans
in
colorado
springs
ah
a
nice
scottish
ale
its
a
little
peaty
and
a
touch
smoky
with
a
clean
caramel
and
toast
malt
character
its
simple
and
tasty
i
like
it
the
body
is
lighter
and
balanced
as
in
its
easy
to
drink
ill
have
another
poured
a
clear
reddishbrown
not
too
dark
with
little
to
no
head
to
be
spoken
of
aroma
was
of
sweet
malts
caramel
apples
and
other
light
fruits
taste
of
caramel
malts
mary
janes
and
some
indistinct
fruit
not
bad
but
a
little
weak
overall
in
flavor
body
and
in
alcohol
a
5
3abv
is
quite
low
for
a
scottish
ale
though
i
suppose
that
adds
to
its
drinkability
yet
i
really
didnt
have
a
desire
to
have
any
more
after
one
session
the
abv
felt
higher
that
whats
listed
here
but
then
im
not
used
to
the
elevation
either
if
it
matters
much
i
was
very
impressed
with
this
beer
why
in
the
hell
didnt
i
buy
some
to
bring
back
home
with
me
the
beer
that
this
brewpub
is
known
for
its
a
pretty
deep
red
thats
clear
with
little
foam
the
aroma
is
thin
with
a
hint
of
malt
and
grain
the
taste
was
good
nice
malts
with
caramel
and
pine
its
fairly
smooth
but
the
body
seems
a
bit
light
for
a
scotish
compared
to
all
of
the
other
local
brewing
companies
such
as
trinity
and
phantom
canyon
i
think
this
scottish
ale
really
stands
out
the
head
once
the
beer
is
poured
is
manageable
ill
definitely
continue
to
drink
this
in
the
future
props
to
bristols
on
this
brew
theres
nothing
intense
about
it
but
its
well
made
and
constructed
with
a
good
knowledge
of
the
style
a
bit
less
carbonation
or
increased
sweetness
couldve
done
this
some
good
appreciable
grain
and
malt
feel
o
easily
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
and
the
best
scottish
ale
ive
gotten
to
try
it
is
a
very
balanced
brew
that
leans
toward
the
malty
side
of
things
but
doesnt
go
overboard
the
hops
are
minimal
but
detectable
which
is
appropriate
for
the
style
if
youre
a
fan
of
scottish
ales
this
one
is
more
than
worth
a
try
and
if
youre
not
a
fan
of
scottish
ales
this
one
might
change
your
mind
an
awesome
brew

a
nicely
balanced
copperbrown
beer
with
a
medium
white
head
nice
retention
and
ok
lace
the
smell
is
of
sweet
malts
toasted
grains
caramels
toffee
and
earthy
grassy
elements
nutty
flavors
with
a
hint
of
roasted
qualities
nice
toasted
malts
caramels
and
sweet
toffee
with
some
earthy
grassy
hops
balanced
in
well
a
nicely
balanced
medium
bodied
very
drinkable
beer
very
well
done
had
this
one
on
tap
yesterday
at
the
bristol
brewing
company
in
colorado
springs
a
favorite
of
both
my
wife
and
her
friend
yesterday
i
found
it
to
be
not
so
bad
myself
poured
a
reddish
brown
color
with
an
ecru
head
on
top
aromas
of
bread
dough
sweet
malt
and
earthy
hops
on
the
palate
sweet
malt
caramel
and
a
very
slight
smokiness
d
nothing
about
it
really
blows
me
away
but
the
decent
taste
and
good
moderate
body
make
it
quite
drinkable
this
is
definitely
a
beer
i
can
return
to
drinkability
very
clean
finish
leaves
just
enough
flavor
on
the
tongue
to
make
you
want
to
refresh
the
tastebuds
of
the
flavor
and
have
another
sip
drinkability
pretty
high
it
doesnt
have
such
a
strong
flavor
that
you
need
to
recharge
afterwards
and
it
tastes
very
smooth
despite
not
kicking
your
taste
buds
it
certainly
has
a
nice
flavor
to
it
a
good
poster
boy
for
the
brand
i
should
have
brought
back
more
than
a
six
pack
d
very
nicely
done
super
drinkable
flavorful
and
sessionable
it
is
nice
to
see
a
flagship
brew
in
this
style
especially
at
this
gravity
levelstrength
some
how
in
this
style
like
too
many
others
competition
takes
a
hold
people
expect
ur
beers
jeez
people
there
is
a
range
to
the
style
i
have
um
found
some
of
those
ahem
unclean
bastards
to
be
right
nice
but
not
every
scottish
beer
needs
to
make
kilts
fall
off
d
smooth
i
could
drink
this
all
day
drinkability
has
a
great
flavor
and
isnt
too
big
very
drinkable
pretty
good
there
is
plenty
of
diacteyl
here
scottish
ales
often
have
diacetyl
but
there
are
usually
other
characteristics
that
help
balance
that
this
is
not
over
done
but
a
little
more
than
i
would
like
still
a
beer
that
i
enjoyed
worth
a
try
has
a
bit
of
a
buttery
diacetyl
flavor
emboldening
the
sweet
caramel
and
slight
peat
flavors
pseudoscottishamber
ale
hints
of
sour
malt
and
thin
for
the
style
flagship
brew
hmmm
there
are
a
few
other
bristol
brews
i
like
better
it
is
a
fairly
pleasant
easy
drinker
but
falls
short
as
a
scottish
style
ale
drinkable
yes
introductory
maybe
certainly
is
better
on
tap
as
a
local
option
not
bad
the
beer
pours
a
murky
orangishbrown
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
very
malt
with
bready
and
toffee
notes
but
i
really
expected
some
sort
of
peat
smoke
aroma
the
flavor
is
peat
smoke
as
well
as
toffee
and
caramel
malts
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
even
though
the
alcohol
content
isnt
that
high
i
wouldnt
consider
this
to
be
a
session
beer
one
for
a
sitting
after
dinner
is
good
just
like
i
would
have
with
a
nice
single
malt
scotch
and
a
snifter
to
bring
the
aroma
out
there
isnt
as
much
of
a
nose
on
this
beer
but
its
still
worth
finding
and
enjoying
before
a
night
is
called
i
wouldnt
mind
having
another
one
once
the
weather
cools
off
a
bit
more
pouring
a
deep
dark
amber
vigorously
for
some
head
which
soon
dissipated
to
leave
me
with
an
unremarkable
albeit
quite
drinkable
ale
with
hints
of
chocolate
and
coffee
comfortable
refreshing
a
light
feeling
for
a
darker
ale
not
something
that
i
would
seek
out
specifically
though
happy
to
drink
it
nice
chestnut
brown
color
with
a
head
that
disappeared
very
quickly
it
has
a
malty
smell
that
seems
pretty
nondescript
the
flavor
seems
right
in
line
for
the
style
but
subtle
malty
a
little
bit
of
smokiness
but
not
overpowering
like
some
scottish
ales
ive
had
very
easy
to
drink
and
i
could
probably
have
had
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
session
pours
a
clear
dark
brown
with
a
thin
crème
head
nose
is
leafy
with
a
fruit
tone
flavor
brings
a
hearty
fruit
tone
seems
slight
apples
smooth
more
sweet
than
earthy
feel
is
low
on
carbonation
and
liquid
is
fairly
smooth
easy
to
drink
medium
level
of
complexity
pretty
nice
every
bit
as
good
as
90
shilling
dont
overlook
this
hidden
gem
luckily
theres
a
lot
of
support
for
this
beer
in
the
co
springs
area
its
a
much
better
goto
beer
than
fat
tire
or
avalanche
in
my
opinion
notes
from
123105
copper
in
color
with
a
slight
beige
head
sweet
and
malty
in
smell
slight
fruity
smell
sweet
in
taste
i
get
notes
of
apple
oatmeal
and
brown
sugar
kinda
rich
in
taste
also
leaves
a
little
on
the
tongue
a
drinkable
beer
that
is
a
mild
scotch
ale
i
do
like
this
beer
but
mainly
because
i
like
the
style
very
sweet
d
not
much
here
at
all
not
as
malty
as
i
thought
it
might
be
it
comes
off
thin
and
carbonated
and
no
particular
flavor
shines
though
i
hope
i
got
a
bad
bottle
it
isnt
horrible
but
not
pounding
back
many
of
these
drinkability
is
fairly
high
in
view
of
the
low
abv
but
this
beer
seems
not
to
style
d
very
flavorful
and
not
too
filling
definitely
a
beer
that
grew
on
me
abv
and
body
will
bring
me
back
to
this
one
d
i
didnt
like
this
much
right
out
of
the
gate
but
it
grew
on
me
the
more
i
drank
it
the
low
abv
and
mild
body
make
this
a
nice
session
beer
love
the
lable
and
quirky
name
easy
drinking
much
better
on
draft
but
a
nice
session
beer
in
the
bottle
d
not
bad
looks
and
smells
great
and
the
flavor
is
average
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
anemic
imho
and
this
doesnt
really
stand
out
in
the
crowd
opinion
this
is
a
decent
beer
it
is
not
flawed
in
any
way
but
it
is
just
really
mild
on
the
palate
the
flavors
are
in
balance
but
the
overall
presentation
of
the
beer
left
me
wanting
for
something
i
personally
just
think
that
they
are
either
just
using
the
wrong
yeast
strain
or
their
mash
temp
is
just
too
low
the
beer
has
a
good
flavor
but
it
leaves
me
thinking
that
something
is
missing
this
comes
out
of
the
tap
a
rich
mahogany
brown
with
a
finebubbled
head
aroma
is
strong
spicy
malty
with
a
hint
of
hops
flavor
is
rich
and
smooth
with
hints
of
hops
caramel
smoke
and
cloves
the
sweet
nicely
balances
the
hop
bitterness
it
goes
down
lively
and
sassy
my
mother
discovered
this
brew
on
a
recent
trip
to
colorado
springs
and
had
to
buy
it
for
me
since
she
had
never
heard
of
it
i
had
never
had
a
scottish
ale
before
and
was
pleasantly
surprised
to
see
the
dark
color
nothing
stood
out
from
the
smell
i
found
this
brew
to
beer
a
little
harsh
to
drink
but
was
very
good
having
been
my
first
voyage
into
the
scottish
ale
style
toasted
grains
and
mild
herbal
bitternessastringency
up
front
nutty
caramelly
doughy
malts
come
forward
slightly
soapy
quality
sweetish
fruits
and
a
little
brown
sugar
midpalate
hint
of
anise
and
leather
light
herbal
bitterness
in
the
otherwise
malty
finish
moderate
body
with
a
pretty
creamy

not
bad
an
amber
color
with
a
below
average
tan
head
nose
has
soem
sweet
candy
mild
malts
and
dark
fruits
the
taste
has
a
scotchy
sweetness
mixed
in
wit
the
fruits
and
candy
well
balanced
by
soem
floral
hops
a
mediuym
body
and
nice
carbonation
a
drinkable
mild
version
of
teh
style
the
body
is
mid
to
light
there
is
a
sweetness
that
leaves
an
under
attenuated
feel
in
there
for
me
could
use
more
body
take
the
roast
out
completely
and
fix
some
of
the
flaws
not
paws
d
extremely
drinkable
and
goes
with
pretty
much
any
meal
even
breakfast
sometimes
a
great
representation
of
a
scottish
ale
drinkability
easy
to
drink
and
a
nice
representation
of
the
style
although
i
am
not
crazy
about
the
grainy
element
poured
a
mahoganyred
color
low
co2
and
a
very
low
offwhite
head
lacing
is
sticky
aroma
is
of
malt
molasses
caramel
and
lightly
earthy
caramel
flavor
with
malt
and
a
very
light
hop
finish
palate
is
light
bodied
and
effervescent
with
a
hoppy
finish
imho
a
fair
representation
of
the
style
but
fairly
onedimensional
i
like
this
beer
i
may
be
taking
the
cute
lab
for
a
walk
more
and
more
often
give
it
a
shot
this
maybe
the
only
american
scottish
ale
ive
had
cant
recall
another
i
love
the
style
this
one
did
not
dissapoint
very
nice
cheers
d
im
not
terribly
impressed
tho
i
recognize
this
beer
has
won
several
awards
and
medals
maybe
i
would
have
had
better
luck
if
it
had
never
been
in
the
fridge
a
fresh
example
of
this
could
easily
be
a
decent
session
beer
but
were
lightyears
from
freshness
with
this
bottle
if
i
happen
to
find
myself
in
colorado
springs
ill
give
it
a
try
ontap
otherwise
i
wont
be
needing
to
try
this
again
drinkability
very
good
to
drink
drinkability
good
flavor
but
a
little
watery
i
expect
more
bold
rich
flavors
from
a
scottish
ale
overall
not
bad
but
not
great
picked
a
bottle
of
this
up
while
traveling
in
the
denver
area
for
the
gabf
in
late
2006
the
beer
poured
a
clear
amber
color
with
a
slight
tan
head
that
lingered
a
bit
but
gave
way
to
a
slight
ring
on
the
end
of
the
glass
the
aroma
was
of
sweet
malt
and
a
touch
of
creaminess
the
taste
was
mainly
malty
creamy
and
sweet
but
with
a
touch
of
hop
bitterness
to
round
things
out
and
make
for
a
solid
and
easy
drinking
ale
drinkability
very
easy
drinker
great
for
sesions
or
any
other
occasion
dark
copper
color
with
a
little
bit
of
off

no
lacing
to
speak
of

is
very
malty
mostly
chocolate
and
caramel
also
a
little
smokiness
sweet
malty
flavor
with
some
smoky
peat
mixed
in
just
a
enough
hop
bitterness
to
provide
a
little
balance
creamy
mouthfeel
but
not
too
heavy
all
in
all
a
pretty
nice
beer
this
would
be
a
great
session
beer
poured
into

minimal
little
to
anything
good
or
bad
here
taste
is
lightly
peaty
malts
with
a
light
hoppy
close
that
lingers
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
both
likable
not
a
bad
brew
here
very
mellow
beer
makes
me
think
more
of
a
brown
ale
in
flavor
slightly
burnt

burnt

huge
offwhite
head
sweet
aroma
with
some
fruit
but
there
is
a
definite
cardboard
aroma
that
isnt
pleasant
the
flavor
is
sweet
with
the
caramelized
sugar
flavor
typical
of
the
style
just
a
bit
fruity
finishes
with
a
cocoa
flavor
and
a
touch
of
hops
good
balance
this
beer
is
almost
very
good
it
has
a
nice
flavor
but
it
doesnt
taste
as
fresh
as
it
should
and
i
dont
think
my
bottle
is
particulary
old
i
would
love
to
try
a
fresh
bottle
to
see
body
is
light
way
too
light
with
big
bubbles
of
carbonation
that
lend
a
very
flat
watery
mouthfeel
and
slick
wet
texture
another
pass
this
is
quite
par
for
the
course
of
a
microbrew
scotch
ale
really
quite
average
and
it
reminds
me
of
the
stock
attempt
at
a
scotch
ale
of
any
mcbrewpub
this
is
easy
to
guzzle
down
or
slowly
nip
but
rather
uninteresting
i
was
disappointed
had
on
tap
at
the
bristol
taproom
during
a
summer
vacation
through
colorado
poured
a
dark
amber
color
with
slight
head
that
dissipated
very
quickly
smell
is
somewhat
lacking
as
i
dont
really
smell
much
of
anything
maybe
a
very
slight
sweetness
taste
is
sweet
at
first
with
an
earthymossy
aftertaste
the
smell
of
this
beer
becomes
more
apparent
the
more
you
drink
of
it
for
some
reason
still
a
sweetmalty
smell
mouthfeel
is
good
although
there
is
very
little
carbonation
this
beer
goes
down
good
overall
not
a
bad
scottish
style
but
ive
had
tastier
ones
than
this
typically
i
look
for
something
in
a
beer
that
stands
out
as
a
remarkable
feature
something
that
makes
me
want
to
try
that
beer
again
this
brew
is
an
exception
the
drinkability
is
enhanced
by
the
fact
that
nothing
really
stands
out
its
extremely
well
balanced
at
least
to
my
palate
i
would
definitely
drink
this
one
again
overall
i
didnt
care
for
it
much
a
little
too
sweet
and
the
off
flavors
and
mouthfeel
turned
me
off
dark
amberred
a
wisp
of
a
head
tiny
bubbles
ceate
a
wave
appearance
on
the
top
sweet
candy
nose
medium
mouthfeel
some
bready
malts
but
very
limited
compexity
just
a
hint
of
alcohol
im
a
bit
disappointed
in
the
lack
of
flavor
develpment
no
apparent
flaws
just
fails
to
develop
well
markedly
sweet
finish
is
to
style
tastes
of
baking
powder
bisuits
with
a
dash
of
cocoa
and
a
smack
on
the
tongue
with
a
cedar
plank
im
thinking
of
the
last
sensation
of
a
salmon
filet
when
its
stuffed
into
a
smokehouse
right
before
its
smoked
beyond
recovery
this
would
be
good
by
the
pitcher
with
smoked
salmon
dill
mayo
pickled
things
and
rye
bread
and
lightly
sweetened
whole
wheat
crackers
its
got
a
nutty
aftertaste
appearance
is
a
mahoganyred
color
low
co2
and
a
very
low
offwhite
head
lacing
is
sticky
aroma
is
of
malt
molasses
caramel
and
lightly
earthy
caramel
flavor
with
malt
and
a
very
light
hop
finish
palate
is
light
bodied
and
effervescent
with
a
hoppy
finish
imho
a
fair
representation
of
the
style
but
fairly
onedimensional
thanks
to
tavernjef
for
sharing
this
after
bringing
it
back
from
the
southwest
this
is
a
very
nice
scottish
ale
although
i
sense
it
teeters
close
to
the
brown
ale
style
still
i
would
recommend
it
dark
rust
somewhat
clouded
barely
a
head
appeared
but
what
did
stayed
on
top
awhile
very
minimal
spotty
lace
aroma
is
faint
of
burntish
toffee
a
bit
buttery
with
some
slight
earthyness
of
peat
moss
or
wet
wood
taste
is
bit
bland
with
some
slight
roasty
factions
in
the
start
which
linger
throughout
some
slight
hops
of
herbalness
and
pale
leafyness
makes
its
way
towards
the
finish
feel
is
a
bit
empty
in
the
middle
start
is
mildly
roasted
and
ends
a
bit
dry
and
buttery
with
slight
nut
shades
overall
feel
in
body
is
thin
but
some
of
the
flavors
keep
it
going
somewhat
to
make
it
worth
drinking
but
its
pretty
average
for
a
scottish
ale
pours
a
nicelooking
deep
reddish
brown
with
a
small
creamy
head
very
nice
aroma
of
roasted
malt
toffee
oak
and
a
light
whiff
of
smoke
slightly
sweet
and
sticky
up
front
with
notes
of
toffee
and
treacle
balanced
by
a
robust
malt
profile
finishes
with
a
sweet
oaky
flavor
that
lingers
in
the
back
of
the
mouth
a
little
sweeter
than
i
tend
to
prefer
in
a
scottish
ale
without
the
hops
nevertheless
a
decent
offering
this
is
quite
drinkable
and
generally
amiable
a
fresh
sample
might
even
be
killer
the
name
got
me
expecting
the
big
malt
fatty
close
burnt
amber
under
thin
fingers
of
lace
wonderful
nose
of
autumn
and
the
fallen
leaves
of
sugar
maples
strewn
about
the
forest
floor
smooth
and
malt
and
balance
and
smooth
this
is
a
perfect
wintertime
ale
suitable
for
fireside
contemplation
or
joyous
snowball
affairs
in
the
front
yard
a
very
drinkable
brew
someone
else
said
it
has
chocolate
somewhere
in
its
makeup
not
really
but
still
a
nice
drink
on
a
hot
day
old
need
to
taste
a
fresh
version
again
but
i
remember
this
being
quite
a
good
brew
when
fresh
thanks
to
arctic
liquors
for
the
sample
o
light
and
hoppy
for
style
a
very
americanized
scottish
ale
a
drinkable
enough
if
rather
plain
scottish
ale
the
malt
somewhat
underwhelming
all
by
its
lonesome
which
i
suppose
is
its
lot
in
the
life
chosen
for
it
glad
i
was
able
to
procure
but
a
single
of
this
as
i
dont
think
i
would
have
much
use
for
the
remainder
of
the
4pack
it
is
sold
in
around
here
overall
hmm
not
much
for
a
scottish
in
fact
id
never
guess
this
was
even
an
ale
if
i
hadnt
known
beforehand
really
grainy
character
yeah
not
a
fan
the
mouthfeel
does
leave
a
little
to
be
desired
and
overall
this
ale
is
a
little
lighter
and
thinner
than
other
scottish
ales
but
nonetheless
it
is
a
fine
ale
a
fine
ale
indeed
the
malt
has
a
touch
of
smoke
to
it
with
some
sharp
notes
roasted
barley
and
a
fruity
flavor
a
touch
of
bitterness
but
more
like
some
bitter
ash
or
smoky
taste
a
little
bitterness
for
the
finish
the
current
version
of
this
brew
tastes
pretty
good
to
me
quite
quaffable
nice
to
taste
a
scottish
ale
in
the
lower
abv
and
less
sticky
style
from
the
16
oz
can
purchased
at
market
of
choice
on
29th
in
eugene
o
i
liked
this
beer
when
i
had
it
at
brew
fest
not
so
much
now
very
drinkable
but
bland
o
i
do
really
enjoy
this
style
but
i
dont
see
too
many
breweries
attempting
it
really
glad
i
was
able
to
find
this
one
in
tallboy
cans
overall
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
if
this
was
available
locally
it
would
be
my
go
to
beer
for
any
occasion
i
am
an
oddity
a
pacific
nwer
who
really
doesnt
like
hops
this
beer
suits
my
taste
perfectly
i
actually
spend
a
lot
of
time
in
scotland
and
fearless
scotch
ale
would
stand
up
well
to
traditional
scottish
lager
like
belhavens
which
is
my
choice
when
there
it
has
a
low
carbonation
and
great
malt
taste
its
a
bit
pricey
about
10
for
4
pint
cans
in
portland
i
used
to
only
find
it
on
tap
but
now
the
16oz
cans
are
popping
up
everywhere
poured
into
a
macandrews
thistle
glass
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
caramel
amber
thin
fine
head
dissipates
quickly
to
a
thin
film
and
ring
around
the
glass
slight
lacing
aroma
mostly
caramel
malt
with
slight
bready
malts
sweet
taste
is
mild
toffee
caramel
malt
a
bit
of
bisquity
malt
in
the
middle
finishes
mild
caramel
malt
a
bit
watery
this
has
all
the
right
elements
for
a
scottish
ale
but
flavors
are
weak
could
be
very
nice
with
more
assertive
flavors
light
to
medium
bodied
too
light
for
the
style
o
average
take
ont
he
style
not
too
shabby
this
is
my
first
taste
of
fearless
and
i
cant
say
it
has
me
clamoring
for
another
too
many
offflavors
going
on
in
this
can
overall
this
is
pretty
good
beer
its
pretty
tasty
but
it
comes
off
as
being
a
little
light
tasting
for
the
style
this
tastes
good
but
i
want
a
little
bit
more
this
is
not
an
easy
beer
to
drink
even
at
5
3
it
really
begins
and
ends
with
caramel
but
the
flavors
through
the
middle
dont
meld
well
it
seemed
to
be
an
attempt
to
make
a
beer
taste
like
a
scotch
a
noble
effort
but
not
quite
there
i
thought
this
would
be
a
no
brainer
to
drink
with
braveheart
i
guess
in
the
sense
that
both
were
gritty
and
lasted
too
long
then
it
works
clear
amber
color
with
a
dense
offwhite
head
with
excellent
retention
and
lacing
the
head
does
recede
to
a
ring
leaving
nothing
much
the
nose
does
have
a
rather
prominent
toasted
malt
character
with
a
rather
strong
earthy
hop
character
very
twiggy
the
palate
opens
with
a
blend
of
toasted
malt
and
brown
sugar
mildly
burnt
however
there
isnt
enough
of
a
body
to
carry
these
flavors
just
a
light
toast
and
not
a
particularly
nutty
backbone
decent
mediumlight
in
body
with
a
drying
mildly
bitter
finish
theres
some
herbal
character
here
decent
stuff
a
little
more
body
would
hugely
improve
things
here
i
feel
like
im
being
harsh
here
but
this
beer
really
has
promise
to
be
better
a
solid
american
interpretation
of
the
scottish
ale
i
appreciate
the
hop
crispness
that
has
been
added
to
the
malt
good
overall
im
quite
favorably
impressed
by
fearless
scottish
ale
this
is
the
first
of
their
beers
that
ive
had
and
i
hope
each
of
the
others
is
as
good
as
this
one
serving
type
can
although
ive
had
it
off
tap
as
well
a
big
shout
out
to
woodychandler
for
providing
this
beer
poured
from
a
16
oz
can
has
a
caramel
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
rather
mild
some
malts
taste
is
also
malts
up
front
a
bit
nutty
just
a
touch
of
hops
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
solid
beer
o
above
average
but
not
by
too
much
this
beer
pours
a
nice
copper
clear
with
good
head
formation
and
retention
slightly
offwhite
lacing
was
minimal
but
a
few
strings
present
smell
was
quite
grainy
with
an
infusion
of
carameltoffee
sweetness
some
bready
malts
as
well
taste
was
strong
sugars
caramel
chocolate
sugar
some
brown
sugar
but
was
complemented
with
some
dark
fruits
a
touch
of
hazelnut
as
well
mouth
was
a
bit
thin
slightly
metallic
overall
this
is
a
decent
canned
scotch
i
enjoyed
the
integration
of
the
sweet
sugars
as
it
wasnt
overwhelming
the
crack
and
glug
went
off
unimpeded
by
any
untoward
events
and
i
was
soon
facing
a
massive
twofinger
thick
tawny
head
with
great
retention
color
was
a
deep
copperyamber
with
just
a
hint
of
haze
nose
had
a
cereal
sweetness
to
it
very
malty
with
a
slight
presence
of
hops
underlying
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
a
nutty
maltiness
and
a
grassy
hoppiness
on
the
tongue
finish
was
slightly
dry
with
the
nutty
bready
flavors
lingering
well
after
the
swallow
it
was
not
a
style
that
i
normally
truck
with
but
it
seemed
okay
in
sum
i
was
glad
to
have
had
the
chance
to
try
it
but
it
really
was
not
my
cup
of
tea
or
glass
of
beer
oh
well
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
head
thin
and
disipated
quickly
very
little
aromanot
much
in
the
way
of
either
malt
or
hops
the
most
prevalant
flavour
being
metallic
not
sure
where
that
comes
from
but
it
is
unplessant
i
keep
wanting
to
give
this
beer
and
brewer
a
chance
but
this
being
my
4th
try
at
this
beer
all
purchased
at
differant
times
and
differant
locations
and
all
with
the
same
result
i
would
highly
recomend
staying
away
from
this
beer
impressively
drinkable
a
bit
light
on
aroma
and
a
touch
thin
but
certainly
a
nicely
drinkable
ale
not
bad
for
the
style
taste
is
very
fruitymalty
with
firm
toastiness
and
a
mellow
clear
nuttiness
light
spiceyearthy
hop
joins
in
before
a
long
caramellytoasty
malt
aftertaste
it
is
very
drinkable
not
overly
complex
but
wellrounded
and
with
good
firm
character
very
fitting
for
a
scottish
ale
drinks
easy
doesnt
overwhelm
and
even
borders
on
dull
although
the
abv
5
3
on
the
can
makes
it
a
nobrainer
for
a
decent
beer
to
knock
back
a
few
of
if
youre
in
that
sort
of
mood
my
wife
definitely
liked
it
more
than
i
did
and
i
was
happy
to
share
the
body
was
full
without
being
heavy
or
sticky
drinkability
was
excellent
and
this
is
not
one
of
my
favorite
styles
overall
a
very
good
brew
worth
seeking
out
this
is
my
first
beer
from
this
brewery
and
i
will
be
seeking
out
more
1
pint
can
amazingly
from
capital

salem
lovelly
looking

here
clear
darkish

with
a
gorgeous

foamy

mainlly
nutty
and
malty
taste
again
slightly

throat
some

and
a

nice

smooth

rich
yet
not
overly
so
actually
not
a
bad
90
schilling
ale
real
surprise
in
a
can
d
one
of
the
better
scottish
ales
usmade
ive
tried
fearless
does
well
to
push
this
as
one
of
their
flagship
labels
its
one
ill
have
again
and
one
i
definitely
recommend
nw
beer
fans
try
if
they
have
the
chance
at
just
5
this
is
certainly
drinkable
beyond
only
a
single
serving
ho
hum
next
this
was
the
brew
that
got
fearless
started
and
its
easy
to
see
why
overall
solid
winter
offering
this
bottle
was
kind
of
old
and
also
fell
out
of
the
refrigerator
prior
to
serving
so
conditions
were
less
than
optimal
not
sure
they
still
make
this
one
a
little
bummed
if
they
dont
i
popped
the
cap
and
let
fly
watching
breathlessly
as
the
pseudocascade
took
place
slowly
morphing
into
twoplus
fingers
of
dense
tawny
head
with
great
retention
color
was
a
brownishcopper
srm
13
17
with
nequality
clarity
nose
was
rich
and
sweet
with
malt
caramel
cocoa
toffee
oh
my
there
are
times
that
i
question
my
buying
habits
because
as
a
hophead
this
is
not
in
my
wheelhouse
the
head
fell
in
an
unusual
way
collapsing
down
and
in
on
itself
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
the
richness
of
the
malt
almost
threw
me
into
diabetic
shock
it
was
tasty
though
more
like
toffee
than
caramel
finish
was
sweet
but
not
cloying
so
i
did
not
have
any
problem
drinking
all
of
it
this
is
one
that
would
be
more
suited
for
the
winter
season
if
i
were
to
get
it
again
overall
a
miss
from
long
trail
too
many
flaws
overall
i
love
this
beer
hibernator
might
be
a
slight
exaggeration
in
the
sense
that
this
really
isnt
a
heavy
beer
but
it
is
most
satisfying
strong
enough
for
winter
but
light
enough
for
spring
o
fortunately
neither
the
initial
hints
of
vinegar
nor
the
medicinal
tinge
lasted
however
this
scottish
ale
did
not
offer
much
other
flavor
the
rest
this
one
doesnt
do
a
whole
lot
for
me
body
is
medium
and
carbonation
is
fine
but
the
aroma
is
slightly
offputting
and
the
taste
didnt
really
make
up
any
ground
drinkable
but
nothing
special
o
i
bought
a
12pack
for
my
wife
and
im
glad
that
she
likes
it
because
i
wouldnt
really
jump
at
the
chance
to
have
another
one
not
a
terrible
beer
but
just
doesnt
suit
my
tastes
advertises
as
a
good
beer
for
a
winter
night
i
agree
especially
since
better
dark
beers
are
a
lot
more
expensive
overall
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
medium
body
with
an
early
bumrush
of
carbonation
works
for
drinkability
booze
never
oversteps
its
boundary
another
good
beer
from
long
trail
this
is
a
good
company
beer
pours
a
massive
3
finger
head
with
a
sticky
lacing
all
the
way
down
the
glass
scents
of
peat
and
grassiness
on
the
nose
taste
is
medium
bodied
with
a
bit
of
unbalance
only
drawback
it
is
an
easy
to
drink
beer
and
good
enough
to
session
not
sure
why
its
classified
as
a
winter
beer
but
hibernator
is
a
nice
alt
style
beer
although
classified
as
a
scottish
ale
o
nice
for
a
winters
night
for
sure
not
great
but
worth
a
try
the
aroma
of
toffee
is
mild
complementing
a
lightly
sweet
flavor
that
is
rather
hoppy
for
a
scottish
ale
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
bespeak
not
so
much
deep
autumn
as
indian
summer
pleasant
sessionable
overall
its
a
really
wellbrewed
ale
and
one
that
satisfies
well
done
drinkable
en
masse
despite
terrible
style
claim
its
a
mild
bock
type
thing
drinkable
and
not
terrible
overall
not
bad
while
the
combination
of
flavors
upfront
was
not
too
appealing
with
somewhat
off
transitions
as
the
brew
warmed
more
it
took
on
a
bit
more
sweetness
allowing
for
a
bridging
of
the
flavors
in
a
smoother
transition
this
is
not
a
scottish
ale
regardless
of
what
long
trail
claims
on
the
website
but
i
dont
know
what
i
would
call
it
long
trail
describes
it
vaguely
as
a
malty
winter
ale
on
the
bottle
and
this
makes
more
sense
this
is
definitely
quaffable
but
its
not
exceptional
in
any
way
i
dont
regret
buying
a
6pack
that
was
on
clearance
for
6
win
overall
a
tasty
malty
treat
hibernator
pours
a
slightly
hazy
burnt
orange
maybe
a
finger
of
bone
colored
foam
crowns
the
beer
and
fades
cleanly
after
a
minute
or
two
the
nose
while
muted
has
a
nice
complexity
toffee
biscuits
and
a
tobacco
aroma
all
make
themselves
known
the
flavor
profile
leads
off
with
malts
that
definitely
lean
more
towards
biscuit
and
bread
than
caramel
and
toffee
theres
a
sharp
bitterness
next
thats
entirely
out
of
place
a
subtle
tobacco
and
herbs
blend
delivers
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
just
lacks
the
fullness
of
body
that
id
expect
for
a
malty
winter
beer
though
the
carbonation
is
appropriately
subdued
i
dont
often
reach
for
long
trail
beers
when
im
browsing
at
my
local
bottle
shop
and
this
hibernator
isnt
going
to
change
my
mind
overall
this
was
a
solid
brew
and
i
enjoyed
a
few
of
them
just
to
make
sure
while
not
very
complex
or
robust
this
beer
knows
and
serves
its
purpose
well
extremely
approachable
sessionable
and
easy
to
drink
this
is
a
definite
safe
option
brew
in
macrohavens
not
a
musttry
by
any
means
but
a
solid
choice
when
options
are
limited
hazey
orange
hue
looks
as
if
there
is
a
lot
of
yeast
still
in
the
mix
bottle
says
unfiltered
so
i
assume
this
is
the
reason
almost
homebrewish
in
appearance
smell
is
dominated
by
hop
aroma
cant
taste
sweetness
more
crisp
hoppy
flavor
that
also
has
a
bite
of
hops
at
the
tail
im
not
really
getting
any
spice
either
so
for
me
this
is
not
a
preferred
winter
beer
offering
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
tumbler
pint
the
beer
is
a
bright
slightly
hazed
vibrant
ruby
coloring
with
a
thin
sparse
filmy
surface
coating
of
head
aromas
of
rich
caramel
both
sweet
and
smooth
a
touch
of
hops
bitterness
and
some
floral
jasmine
highlights
very
smooth
and
balanced
aromas
flavors
are
rich
and
roasty
with
a
scotch
and
caramel
backbone
that
is
sweet
but
balanced
malt
profiles
expound
as
the
beer
covers
the
palate
giving
rise
to
some
bready
and
molasses
characteristics
light
bodied
despite
the
rich
flavors
and
when
combined
with
the
lower
abv
this
beer
becomes
very
drinkable
sweet
slightly
tart
aftertaste
with
the
hops
presence
resurfacing
for
a
touch
of
bitter
and
spice
to
clean
the
palate
crisp
clean
finish
with
a
touch
of
spice
linger
tasty
brew
not
bad
at
all
a
soso
ale
and
a
descent
scottish
a
bit
bland
ultimately
interesting
and
worth
a
try
as
it
goes
down
easy
but
presents
a
good
body
and
a
stronger
flavor
but
probably
not
something
ill
return
to
in
the
future
to
say
it
quickly
this
beer
is
good
it
looks
by
the
label
to
be
more
of
a
winter
beer
but
it
isnt
at
all
its
not
dark
or
heavy
or
has
a
distinct
taste
but
it
is
good
and
i
can
see
it
being
relatively
easy
to
drink
several
of
these
its
pretty
neutral
so
i
can
see
ipa
and
ale
fans
enjoying
this
while
those
that
like
a
darker
and
heavier
fare
try
a
few
of
those
for
a
lighter
alternative
long
trail
is
a
fine
brewery
that
makes
some
great
beers
this
one
probably
ranks
slightly
above
the
median
of
its
offerings

i
assume
this
was
the
brewedon
date
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
brew
was
the
malty
inclusion
and
the
eventual
complexity
to
the
flavoring
while
not
all
the
flavors
were
necessarily
well
blended
that
malty
complexity
of
toffee
caramel
chocolate
and
coffee
all
coming
together
was
nice
we
felt
the
nose
to
be
a
bit
mild
and
ultimately
the
beer
need
a
bit
more
sweetness
to
fit
the
classic
stylistic
guidelines
overall
a
good
take
on
the
scotch
ale
but
one
thats
not
for
me
with
the
other
had
hitting
winter
warmers
this
one
takes
a
backseat
i
still
find
myself
buying
it
though
taste
is
straightforward
with
caramel
malt
leading
the
charge
decent
creaminess
soft
carbonation
toffee
in
the
aftertaste
not
much
of
a
hop
presence
but
its
not
sorely
missed
with
this
beer
lightly
spiced
this
beer
was
an
interesting
spin
on
a
winter
seasonal
i
cant
say
it
followed
the
scotch
ale
style
much
but
it
certainly
had
nice
complexity
and
ill
definitely
look
for
it
again
it
was
very
similar
to
a
fordham
scotch
ale
only
with
a
winter
spice
character
medium
bodied
with
prickly
carbonation
overall
this
one
is
real
solid
well
crafted
and
tasty
for
sure
from

this
is
a

a

be
better
if
there
was
more

to
it
but
its
enjoyable
regardless

the

almost
a

simply

the
taste
is

with

the
body
is
lightweight
theres
an
exceedingly
long
bitternut
finish
frankly
i
find
this

one

goes
down
well
and
is
a

brew
poured

nonetheless
oa

what
is
that
spice
onot
a
bad
beer
something
you
can
have
a
few
of
and
not
get
sick
of
worth
a

this
is
a
scottish
ale
couldve
fooled
me
a
winter
warmer
maybe
poured
into
a
stem
glass
a
darker
amber
color
with
a
slight
haze
and
a
nice
cap
of
foamy
white
head
that
left
some
attractive
lacing
on
the
glass
throughout
the
session
aroma
of
sweet
malts
slightly
nutty
sweet
taste
of
malts
honey
brown
sugar
bready
with
light

and
some

no
real
characteristics
of
any
scottish
ale
ive
ever
had
and
a
low
abv
to
boot
still
a
nice
beer
overall
mediumbodied
and
went
down
pretty
easy
and
smooth
extremely
wellbalanced
and
warming
without
the
overkill
of
some
winter
releases
this
is
a
nice
scottishstyle
winter
warmer
to
drink
if
you
want
to
have
more
than
one
and
dont
want
to
get
buzzed
too
quickly
good
fridge
beer
but
not
particularly
memorable
o
good
for
the
style
awesome
to
me
always
look
forward
to
having
this
every
winter
an
okay
winter
ale
doesnt
offer
much
beyond
that
definitely
improves
with
warmth
othere
is
nothing
off
putting
in
this
beer
however
it
has
a
bunch
of
malt
and
little
else
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
definitely
my
favorite
from
long
trail
call
it
a
hybrid
of
a
scottish
ale
british
winter
warmer
and
hoppy
bockbier
got
me
i
have
another
overall
a
supremely
solid
beer
im
quite
pleased
knowing
ive
got
five
more
of
these
the
carbonation
is
a
tad
much
for
my
preference
but
allinall
i
totally
dig
this
brew
overall
this
is
a
nice
take
on
a
winter
beer
i
would
have
liked
just
a
touch
more
sweetness
but
not
a
bad
beer
i
really
like
the
way
this
starts
clean
and
as
it
progresses
it
becomes
more
expressive
with
light
fruit
tinges
from
the
yeast
blending
with
the
slight
toasted
graininess
in
the
malt
profile
there
is
a
hint
of
pepper
with
the
mild
accent
of
caramel
malt
in
the
mix
the
taste
of
apple
skins
are
noted
with
a
mild
piney
flavor
from
the
hops
which
are
very
tasty
combined
with
the
scottish
yeast
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
so
much
flavor
for
a
relatively
low
abv
beer
the
way
it
finishes
is
mostly
dry
yet
clean
in
general
without
too
much
in
the
way
of
what
counts
a
nice
balance
of
the
yeast
malt
and
hop
flavors
o
in
the
bottle
its
good
on
tap
its
better
o
overall
i
think
this
is
a
very
drinkable
winter
ale
its
a
good
everyday
beer
nothing
too
special
but
not
a
let
down
i
wasnt
expecting
a
big
beer
with
a
thick
body
and
for
the
price
im
pretty
happy
with
it
9
dollars
a
12
pack
if
anything
its
a
good
in
between
beer
when
trying
a
lot
of
other
beers
o
long
trails
got
a
little
ways
to
go
here
but
one
things
for
sure
they
picked
grains
that
would
make
this
beer
look
and
smell
excellent
now
they
just
have
to
get
that
to
the
taste
buds
in
a
much
stronger
way
im
sure
those
malts
can
come
through
much
stronger
and
when
they
do
those
batches
will
be
phenomenal
this
is
still
a
very
good
beer
that
id
come
back
to
next
winter
o
i
cant
pick
a
winner
here
both
descent
scottish
ales
not
my
favorite
from
long
trail
but
worth
a
try
this
winter
overall
nice
brew
i
remember
the
flavors
as
more
pronounced
from
previous
years
versions
but
this
is
still
one
of
my
favorite
long
trail
brews

top
but
a
good

long

in
my
opinion
makes
good
beers
thier
like
a
second
tier
brewery
and
they
try
hard
but
this
is
just
an
average
scotch
ale
pale
aleamber
ale
whatever
i
like
this
beer
perhaps
out
of
a
tap
in
vermont
it
would
be
better
but
today
its
just
average
mouthfeel
is
smooth
but
leaves
you
wanting
more
not
quite
the
umphh
youd
expect
from
a
winter
seasonal
overall
hibernator
is
a
enjoyable
maltforward
beer
for
a
cool
winters
evening
but
it
lacks
the
strength
to
make
it
stand
out
in
a
crowded
field
of
winter
brews
a
fantastic
seasonal
brew
that
i
look
forward
to
every
year
recommended
d
one
minute

one
minute
malty
the
next
a
little
bitter
good
complexity
on
the
body
of
this
thing
a
tasty
winter
brew
that
is
perfect
for
the
falling
of
the
leaves
i
wish
there
was
a
little
more
on
the
body
here
but
otherwise
solid
great
beer
but
not
exactly
something
id
use
to
battle
the
cold
months
of
winter
definitely
good
though
o
a
good
scottish
ale
though
i
have
had
few
of
the
style
i
enjoyed
it
this
is
quite
nice
and
at
a
decent
price
point
i
guess
i
get
the
classification
as
a
scotch
style
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
will
get
more
in
the
near
future
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
deep
brown
color
with
a
thin
tan
head
on
top
this
beer
has
a
malty
sweet
aroma
with
some
earthy
aromas
too
the
flavors
of
some
light
spice
back
up
with
some
roasted
malts
and
caramel
the
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
is
drinkable
its
not
really
thick
and
has
a
decent
carbonation
overall
its
not
a
bad
brew
its
got
some
warming
spices
in
there
that
are
nice
but
im
had
better
winter
beers
overall
this
is
a
very
drinkable
winter
beer
it
is
not
too
heavy
and
the
flavors
work
for
the
season
d
very
drinkable
the
flavors
are
really
nicely
balanced
especially
the
spices
the
slight
hop
presence
is
also
very
nice
odhibernator
is
not
too
shabby
its
hard
to
go
into
a
store
looking
for
a
winter
seasonal
and
not
come
out
with
sierra
nevadas
celebration
ale
a
sixpack
of
hibernator
won
the
battle
once
only
once
it
may
not
be
a
true
scottish
ale
but
i
think
this
is
one
they
got
right
no
matter
what
you
call
it
o
overall
the
beer
was
very
good
the
beer
balances
sweet
with
hops
very
nicely
and
leaves
a
nice
aftertaste
i
would
highly
recommend
this
beer
to
all
drinkers
i
think
hopheads
will
be
enjoy
the
amount
of
hops
that
come
through
in
the
end
this
is
a
nice
session
beer
however
i
would
expect
a
bit
more
malt
and
a
little
less
hops
for
this
style
pours
a
slightly
hazy
dark
copper

one
finger

with
decent

properties
aromas
are
sweet
somewhat
caramelly
and
grainy
a
bit
simplistic
for
a
beer
of
this
style
flavors
are
consistent
with
the
nose
but
add
another
layer
on
the
finish
by
contributing
a
tealike
or
earthy
bitterness
that
balances
the
malts
such
a
wellcrafted
mediumfull
body
should
be
more
flavorful
in
my
opinion
this
beer
has
a
pleasantly
hefty
weight
and
feel
but
lacks
the
flavor
strength
to
withstand
a
hunk
of
basic
cheddar
if
the
maltiness
were
more
assertive
id
give
this
two
thumbs
up

against
the

favorite
style
of
ale
but
even
so
i
expected
something
that
stands
out
this
beer
seems
rather
bland
to
me
drinkability
a
decent
and
somewhat
sessionable
brew
for
the
winter
both
a
little
hoppier
and
heavier
than
i
expected
originally
which
turns
out
to
not
be
a
bad
thing
at
all
i
thought
it
was
pretty
good
the
original
taste
had
me
question
it
but
it
won
me
over
a
good
winter
beer
and
i
recommend
it
hibernator
is
a
good
name
for
a
doppelbock
which
i
thought
this
was
when
i
picked
up
the
bottle
when
i
tasted
it
i
thought
it
was
a
hoppy
amber
now
i
see
that
its
supposed
to
be
a
scotch
ale
and
it
might
be
a
good
one
if
the
malt
bill
was
beefed
up
d
a
nice
winter
ale
from
long
trail
brings
a
good
malt
punch
in
its
moderate
abv
package
d
the
beer
went
down
very
smoothly
i
would
have
no
problem
having
more
than
one
of
these
at
a
time
di
wish
it
was
a
little
maltier
and
richer
but
overall
a
decent
sessionable
winter
beer
to
enjoy
since
its
so
easy
to
drink
id
say
below
average
drinkability
just
because
it
seems
a
bit
off
d
overall
a
tasty
brew
though
i
wouldnt
call
it
overly
special
maybe
im
comparing
it
too
much
to
a
belhavens
another
solid
beer
from
long
trail
this
would
be
a
good
sessionable
brew
to
get
drunk
off
of
nothing
to
make
you
stand
up
and
seek
it
out
but
if
the
price
were
right
it
would
be
ok
to
session
just
not
a
stand
out
brew
medium
bodied
medium
carbed
mouthfeel
goes
down
easy
enough
just
seems
to
me
there
are
far
better
offerings
to
be
had
d
considering
ive
had
4
of
them
tonight
with
2
more
lingering
in
the
midst
i
think
this
is
one
of
the
winter
seasonals
that
went
under
the
radar
pretty
good
this
is
likely
the
most
drinkable
scottish
ale
i
have
had
but
it
isnt
very
interesting
if
you
love
scottish
ales
but
never
have
found
one
to
crush
try
this
not
bad
i
wouldnt
have
guessed
this
as
a
scottish
ale
but
i
thought
it
was
pretty
solid
12oz
bottle
served
in
my
sa
perfect
pint
pours
a
translucent
amber
with
a
frothy
halfinch
creamcolored
head
head
eventually
dissipates
into
a
thin
fairly
consistent
skim
with
a
few
slashes
of
lacing
not
much
happening
in
the
nose
i
get
some
toasted
malts
off
the
bottle
pop
but
the
aromas
really
dissipate
in
the
glass
perhaps
a
mediummalt
backbone
with
some
earthiness
and
a
bit
of
berry
or
dark
stone
fruit
taste
consistent
with
nose
with
the
addition
of
a
light
toasted
character
and
a
citrus
quality
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
but
closer
to
light
with
a
little
bit
of
citrus
astringency
and
a
pleasant
even
carbonation
a
solid
scottish
ale
perhaps
not
as
malty
as
i
would
prefer
and
a
bit
on
the
simple
side
however
quite
an
easy
drinking
brew
definitely
one
of
my
more
favored
beers
from
their
regular
lineup
3
5
d
not
a
bad
drink
if
nothing
better
exists
but
no
reason
to
seek
this
out
mediumfull
body
but
still
too
thin
this
is
a
sessionable
scotch
ale
needs
more
smokiness
needs
more
strength
these
could
go
down
easy
but
you
can
do
better
still
one
of
the
better
ones
from
this
brewer
great
drinkability
this
brew
is
great
and
isnt
overkill
when
it
comes
to
scottish
ales
great
job
by
long
trail
d
na
their
really
isnt
much
to
rave
about
this
beer
it
came
off
more
like
a
red
ale
with
the
sweetness
and
really
didnt
seem
like
a
winter
sort
of
ale
needs
more
body
and
maybe
abv
md
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
very
clean
drinking
overall
its
not
bad
i
would
drink
it
again
but
would
prefer
to
try
some
others
in
the
style
to
get
a
better
handle
of
what
a
scottish
should
be
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
but
that
leads
to
excellent
drinkability
d
a
good
scottish
ale
havent
had
too
many
of
these
good
cold
weather
beer
would
be
great
with
a
holiday
dinner
d
i
would
think
that
this
is
a
drinkable
ale
makes
you
want
to
be
the
bear
on
the
label
nice
winter
beer
really
tasty
this
is
a
pretty
mediocre
beer
overall
but
that
doesnt
make
it
unpleasant
i
like
a
bit
more
body
on
a
cold
evening
hell
ya
i
do
but
this
is
a
pretty
easy
drinker
this
is
basically
one
of
those
not
bad
for
the
price
beers
taste
is
very
malty
and
peaty
with
a
nice
sweet
finish
theres
a
bit
of
a
metallic
taste
but
its
not
too
bad
overall
for
a
scotch
its
a
bit
tame
however
that
means
its
real
drinkable
and
good
for
people
who
havent
had
the
style
too
many
times
d
very
drinkable
maltcentric
brew
that
doesnt
forget
the
hops
hv
long
trail
hibernator
poored
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
small
head
there
wasnt
a
very
strong
smell
but
it
had
a
slight
sweet
smell
to
it
it
tasted
hoppy
and
almost
had
a
slight
sweetness
to
it
it
didnt
leave
much
of
an
aftertaste
and
was
very
easy
to
drink
overall
this
beer
was
very
good
its
a
shame
its
only
a
seasonal
but
it
is
one
of
the
better
beers
for
winter
at
this
price
point
not
alot
better
out
there
in
my
opinion
for
this
type
of
beer
d
long
trail
makes
this
one
easy
to
drink
and
delicious
at
the
same
time
not
too
strong
or
heavy
and
easy
to
keep
going
on
a
few
of
these
pours
deep
clear
copper
with
large
fluffy
head
aroma
is
malty
carmelly
flavor
is
sweet
malty
with
dark
caramel
and
toffee
a
little
overripe
floral
hop
character
but
relatively
little
hop
bitterness
its
there
but
like
a
subtly
spicy
tea
mouthfeel
is
relatively
thin
not
deep
but
a
good
winter
warmer
in
short
this
might
be
my
favorite
regular
brew
from
long
trail
outside
of
their
big
bottle
offerings
good
body
nice
flavor
and
easy
to
drink
glad
to
have
this
brewery
close
by
i
would
buy
this
again
nice
winter
ale
drinkability
i
could
definitely
have
a
few
of
these
on
a
cold
winter
night
not
sure
if
ill
go
back
to
it
again
but
it
is
definitely
a
good
try
and
i
think
it
would
make
a
great
session
beer
d
nothing
spectacular
about
this
beer
it
is
a
scottish
ale
i
guess
but
it
serves
its
purpose
as
a
nice
winter
warmer
nice
if
you
are
looking
for
a
decent
pint
very
sessionable
pours
a
light
honey
brown
color
with
a
small
yet
tight
khaki
colored
head
that
left
some
clingy
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
bready
with
some
caramel
and
has
a
light
lemony
sourness
the
taste
is
of
a
big
bready
malt
with
a
rusty
metaltin
note
followed
by
a
bitter
hop
there
is
some
light
fruitiness
from
lemon
and
some
sort
of
berry
the
flavor
is
a
bit
harsh
moderate
body
with
plenty
of
fizzy
carbonation
starts
sweet
but
does
have
a
bitter
aspect
an
ok
scottish
ale
would
like
to
see
more
of
a
malt
showcase
with
less
of
the
bitter
aspect
i
wouldnt
turn
this
down
but
wouldnt
pick
it
up
if
i
were
looking
for
a
scottish
ale
cheers
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
mild
some
hops
and
malts
taste
is
very
hoppy
and
downright
bitter
not
to
my
liking
feels
light
and
bitter
in
the
mouth
and
has
average
drinkability
overall
not
a
beer
that
i
really
cared
for
moreys
bottom
line
a
good
winter
brew
in
the
vein
of
bells
christmas
brooklyn
winter
and
stoudts
winter
more
of
a
session
winter
than
a
warmer
in
my
opinion
hibernator
is
pretty
drinkable
but
lacks
any
form
of
malty
richness
pours
a
clear
amber
color
with
2
fingers
of
slightly
off
white
head
pretty
decent
retension
and
an
ample
amount
of
lacing
head
is
actually
creepy
looking
as
the
larger
bubbles
pop
and
fade
resulting
in
a
thick
head
that
has
an
uneven
craterfilled
surface
intersting
nose
is
slight
malt
with
a
faint
amount
of
hops
and
a
bit
of
grain
taste
is
a
little
more
bitter
forward
than
others
for
the
style
also
tasting
grain
throughout
and
a
lingering
partially
metallic
aftertaste
medium
feel
low
carb
not
bad
overall
right
off
the
bat
this
one
looks
great
a
dark
rusty
transparent
body
is
capped
off
by
a
generous
head
that
gives
way
to
some
decent
lacing
its
kind
of
weird
in
terms
of
style
the
name
maybe
unintentionally
suggests
a
doppelbock
and
the
sweet
malt
profile
in
the
taste
and
smell
are
also
similar
to
the
style
though
a
little
more
nutty
thats
where
the
similarities
end
but
it
still
doesnt
seem
like
a
scottish
ale
as
its
classified
here
pretty
darn
good
though
and
a
classic
winter
seasonal
in
the
northeast
so
maybe
the
lesson
to
be
learned
is
not
to
overthink
it
drinkability
rates
relatively
high
and
it
is
interesting
to
drink
a
rather
hoppy
scottish
ale
a
nice
twist
on
the
style
from
long
trail
drinkability
meh
nothing
id
go
out
of
my
way
to
pick
up
but
ive
definitely
had
worse
beers
d
very
strong
and
satisfying
flavor
even
on
big
sips
enjoyable
and
easy
to
keep
drinking
drinkability
i
would
expect
a
bit
more
malt
to
make
the
flavor
profile
more
interesting
the
grainy
aspect
just
doesnt
work
very
well
for
me
d
very
drinkable
and
tasty
but
not
overpowering
in
any
way
the
usual
humble
clean
and
leisurely
long
trail
traits
as
applied
to
a
scottish
ale
d
overall
pretty
good
im
enjoying
this
one
d
a
good
beer
on
a
long
cold
night
the
long
trail
brewing
co
will
never
disappoint
d
this
was
a
solid
brew
and
i
enjoyed
a
few
of
them
to
prove
the
point
while
not
very
complex
or
robust
this
beer
knows
what
it
is
and
serves
its
purpose
well
extremely
approachable
and
easy
to
drink
this
is
a
definite
safe
option
brew
in
macrohavens
not
a
musttry
by
any
means
but
a
solid
choice
when
options
are
limited
cheers
d
light
in
alcohol
and
i
wish
i
picked
up
more
of
this
not
expecting
much
i
was
quite
surprised
at
the
outcome
give
this
one
a
try
if
you
have
not
had
it
a
very
drinkable
scottish
ale
that
does
not
stray
far
from
the
style
good
stuff
light
to
medium
body
hint
of
texture
towards
the
finish
carbonation
is
moderate
but
a
bit
fizzy
at
times
copper
color
with
big
offwhite
marshmallow
head
a
very
subtle
aroma
pulls
through
burned
sugar
malt
slight
spice
medium
bodied
with
notes
of
bread
toffee
malt
slight
hops
in
the
center
some
ginger
and
a
light
fruity
undertones
at
the
finish
a
malty
session
brew
that
fits
for
the
fall
season
but
thats
where
the
appeal
ends
first
of
all
with
the
name
hibernator
why
couldnt
this
be
a
doppelbock
anyway
this
was
a
decent
but
not
overly
impressive
brew
it
looked
quite
nice
an
opaque
tanbrown
with
a
nice
head
that
receded
to
a
thin
film
smell
was
pretty
neutral
malt
and
hops
nothing
special
i
think
i
was
expecting
more
in
the
flavor
and
mouthfeel
its
malty
but
not
sweet
hoppy
but
not
in
your
face
and
dryer
in
the
finish
than
id
like
i
also
caught
a
lot
more
warming
alcohol
than
i
expected
from
a
5
6
beer
not
bad
but
not
worth
a
whole
6er
double
bag
remains
my
favorite
long
trail
brew
good
drinkability
good
taste
nice
balance
a
good
beer
to
relax
with
on
a
cold
night
d
a
very
delicious
scottish
ale
more
hops
than
most
scottish
ales
pours
a
clean
clear
lightredorangebrown
with
a
very
thin
white
head
which
disappeared
almost
instantly
smells
of
butterscotch
molasses
the
taste
starts
with
a
strong
sweet
maltiness
then
ends
with
a
nutty
finish
which
hangs
around
on
the
tongue
goes
down
smoothe
and
easy
drinkability
fine
for
one
but
i
think
id
switch
after
my
first
to
try
something
else
i
do
have
to
say
that
this
was
my
first
sample
of
this
beer
and
based
on
the
ator
in
the
name
i
was
expecting
a
doppelbock
and
not
a
scotch
ale
nonetheless
it
was
a
worthwhile
brew
pulled
out
of
a
mixed
case
the
appears
is
a
simple
brown
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
leaves
a
lot
to
be
desired
with
a
plain
tooclean
mix
of
mineraly
water
and
a
hint
of
toffee
the
flavor
gets
a
little
better
with
a
deep
caramel
and
toffee
flavor
and
hint
of
chocolate
its
not
perfect
the
flavor
is
too
weak
for
the
style
but
overall
this
is
an
ok
beer
not
bad
overall
kind
of
basic
on
all
fronts
but
a
nice
tasting
beer
looking
at
the
style
on
this
profile
now
makes
sense
given
the
name
i
was
expecting
a
doublebock
felt
it
fell
short
of
the
style
not
a
bad
brew
but
not
one
id
search
out
overall
a
good
beer
to
try
but
not
my
favorite
from
long
trail
notes
a
good
beer
to
have
on
a
cold
night
and
one
to
keep
in
rotation
as
it
was
very
drinkable
drinkability
good
beer
more
seasonable
than
most
winter
ales
d
i
was
turned
off
by
the
smell
but
after
my
first
sip
i
was
hooked
a
nice
beer
that
i
will
be
enjoying
again
a
great
beer
to
have
on
a
cold
day
a
tad
bit
heavy
but
not
too
heavy
and
would
go
good
with
a
nice
steak
pours
a
hazy
orangey
brown
with
a
nice
thick
12
cm
head
aroma
is
sort
of
like
raison
detre
very
raisiny
that
suggests
of
alcohol
or
a
doppelbock
with
a
good
balance
of
malt
and
hops
taste
is
extremely
malty
with
well
placed
hop
bitterness
finish
and
really
tastes
like
it
has
more
alcohol
than
it
really
does
a
bit
of
a
grainy
sandy
mouthfeel
to
it
usually
im
all
about
malty
beers
but
this
one
is
just
rubbing
me
the
wrong
way
at
the
moment
something
about
the
suggestive
alcohol
content
although
its
only
5
6
is
getting
to
me
not
bad
but
im
having
a
hard
time
finishing
it
taste
is
where
i
really
liked
this
beer
nice
malt
backing
with
a
slight
bitterness
not
too
much
malt
and
not
too
much
hops
very
good
balance
excellent
session
beer
i
had
several
its
odd
i
had
a
long
trail
sampler
pack
this
summer
in
upstate
ny
and
recall
really
enjoying
it
is
the
winter
sampler
pack
all
that
different
something
tells
me
im
not
going
to
dig
the
milk
stout
or
the
hoppy
ipa
either
d
a
good
choice
for
lunch
the
ale
wont
knock
you
out
despite
its
decent
flavor
profile
another
trade
with
coworker
had
several
of
the
long
trail
offerings
previously
and
the
hibernator
follows
along
a
good
solid
beer
the
color
is
a
deep
amber
almost
brown
pours
with
a
small
offwhite
head
that
disappears
shortly
very
smooth
taste
the
beer
feels
very
dry
on
the
tongue
and
leaves
a
distinct
but
pleasant
aftertaste
this
is
a
good
choice
for
the
winter
season

d
its
not
bad
but
its
not
good
either
im
a
long
trail
fan
but
this
one
was
a
disappointment
its
like
a
watered
down
double
bag
my
only
complaint
is
that
i
didnt
read
the
label
close
enough
i
picked
this
up
thinking
it
was
an
olde
ale
style
you
know
warm
fireplace
bear
looking
cozy
etc
but
i
got
a
lucky
surprise
that
it
was
a
pretty
decent
scottish
ale
appears
a
deep
caramel
amber
brown
with
a
large
off
white
khaki
head
forms
a
thick
head
that
leaves
behind
even
bands
of
lacing
aromatics
sweet
baked
holiday
breads
with
a
touch
of
peated
malt
overall
really
sweet
caramel
tones
with
a
touch
of
alcohol
all
of
their
beers
have
that
touch
of
maple
syrup
in
them
especially
the
triple
bag
i
had
on
ta
last
night
flavor
isnt
overtly
too
sweet
a
rustic
somewhat
balanced
with
hard
edges
of
herbal
notes
and
earthiness
kinda
stuck
on
the
tobacco
leaf
kick
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
a
tad
cloying
not
overly
heavy
in
anyway
but
something
just
doesnt
sit
well
with
each
sip
i
thought
their
ipa
was
rock
solid
but
so
far
i
cant
say
long
trail
is
one
of
the
greats
through
their
whole
portfolio
drinkability
is
pretty
weak
with
this
offering
not
the
brew
i
would
look
for
again
anytime
soon
12oz
bottle
from
the
local
shaws
pours
a
hazy
but
translucent
brown
body
with
a
thin
half
inch
of
offwhite
head
that
leaves
some
nice
lacing
chocolate
and
caramel
and
toffee
notes
as
well
characterize
the
aroma
chocolate
roastiness
caramel
sweetness
just
a
tinge
of
peatiness
mediumbodied
with
ample
carbonation
a
pretty
easydrinker
a
fairly
simple
straightforward
scottish
ale
but
a
good
drinker
for
a
winter
night
d
definately
drinkable
gonna
keep
this
one
on
ahnd
for
a
while
pours
a
rich
deep
ruby
with
a
blossoming
khaki
head
falling
back
with
excellent
lacing
he
smell
is
soft
cherries
and
subtle
malt
undertones
the
rich
juice
flavor
delivers
those
before
exploding
into
a
grapefruit
bitterness
and
then
calming
into
a
enveloping
biscuty
finish
it
rolls
smooth
across
the
tongue
despite
the
biterness
in
the
middle
and
would
be
excellent
for
an
outdoor
weekend
by
the
fire
all
in
all
im
suprised
at
how
all
over
the
place
the
reveiws
are
as
this
is
an
imeninantly
drinkable
beer
although
its
not
heavy
and
the
abv
is
relatively
mild
for
a
winter
brew
there
is
a
limitation
on
the
drinkability
maybe
just
that
it
is
anything
particularly
special
imo
worth
checking
out
though
as
a
lighter
winter
ale
a
good
sipping
session
brew
for
winter
i
want
to
be
just
like
the
bear
on
the
bottle
cozied
up
in
front
of
a
fire
with
a
blanket
across
my
legs
and
this
beer
in
my
hand
long
trail
seasonals
have
never
quite
impressed
me
but
this
scottish
ale
winter
offering
is
better
than
par
for
them
blah
a
subpar
scottish
ale
aroma
was
weak
stale
caramel
malt
with
not
much
else
pour
was
an
average
cloudy
medium
amber
with
no
bubbles
and
just
a
hint
of
a
thin
tan
ring
for
a
head
taste
was
very
average
a
hint
of
roasted
malt
but
mostly
caramel
with
no
hops
apparent
little
carbonation
drinkability
i
am
by
no
means
a
long
trail
guy
i
actually
cant
stand
some
of
the
beers
they
put
out
because
they
have
alot
of
potential
with
their
ingredients
but
never
seem
to
come
through
strong
but
this
is
a
damn
good
offering
smooth
robust
and
just
right
for
a
cold
autumn
night
kudos
to
long
trail
for
finally
hitting
something
on
the
head
poured
from
a
bottle
i
received
as
a
sample
from
longtrail
pours
a
dark
amber
medium
carbonation
smells
malty
with
butterscotch
hints
tastes
slightly
hoppy
a
little
spicy
up
front
finishes
smooth
but
a
little
blah
easy
to
drink
decent
beer
from
longtrail
normally
im
a
big
fan
of
scottish
ales
or
the
wee
heavy
style
but
this
one
just
wasnt
doing
it
for
me
just
clearly
not
enough
flavor
or
taste
for
the
style
when
i
get
a
scottish
ale
i
want
it
to
be
smokey
and
malty
like
old
chub
from
oskar
blues
this
one
poured
a
nice
red
color
but
the
smell
was
nonexistent
along
with
the
taste
usually
long
trail
has
some
good
stuff
but
this
is
decent
at
best
i
mean
its
highly
drinkable
because
it
has
no
taste
but
thats
not
a
great
thing
probably
not
the
best
long
trail
ive
had
but
its
close
pours
a
copper
color
with
a
medium
sized
head
aroma
is
malty
and
a
little
sugary
flavor
is
malty
nutty
slightly
sweet
with
brown
sugary
notes
spicy
and
warming
a
good
one
for
the
colder
weather
out
of
the
bottle
and
into
my
glass
this
beer
is
an
amber
color
with
some
reddish
hues
offwhite
head
laces
a
little
but
not
much
retention
nose
of
roasted
malts
hints
of
caramel
palate
is
predominantly
malts
with
subtle
hops
underneath
unbalanced
caramel
wheat
bread
slightly
sweet
medium
carbonation
decent
mouthfeel
but
not
as
filling
as
i
was
expecting
or
hoping
for
in
a
winter
seasonal
about
par
for
lt
and
it
does
display
their
usual
drinkability
and
smoothness
but
there
are
far
better
winter
brews
long
trail
hibernator
hasnt
taken
very
kindly
to
hibernation
a
5
6
beer
wont
last
forever
but
id
expect
it
to
have
held
up
better
than
this
in
the
9
months
or
so
since
bottling
fresh
hibernator
is
probably
a
different
and
better
story
nothing
special
pretty
good
but
this
just
seems
like
an
unfiltered
and
watered
down
version
of
lts
double
bag
the
hibernator
is
good
and
its
cool
that
its
unfiltered
the
smell
is
predominantly
malty
some
sweet
nuttiness
my
main
problem
with
this
one
is
the
mouth
feel
which
seemed
too
watery
to
me
goes
down
relatively
easily
for
a
winter
brew
just
buy
double
bag
instead
unless
youre
sick
of
it
d
enjoyed
this
beer
and
could
easier
down
a
six
pack
with
friends
very
drinkable
in
the
winter
i
could
have
many
of
these
overall
not
bad
i
used
to
be
a
huge
fan
of
this
one
but
over
the
years
it
cant
really
hold
a
candle
to
some
of
superior
ones
in
its
class
still
i
drank
this
sixer
without
a
problem
definitely
recommend
trying
this
brew
long
trail
brewing
companys
hibernator
pours
out
the
bottle
and
inot
the
glass
a
dark
copper
color
the
head
is
relatively
nice
in
size
but
short
lasting
the
initial
smell
is
of
spices
with
malt
and
yeast
breaking
through
but
overall
the
smell
is
tantalizing
the
taste
is
a
tad
bit
bland
not
matching
the
spicy
aroma
with
malt
being
up
front
on
the
buds
there
is
a
late
arriving
metallic
bitter
bite
a
descent
beer
but
not
one
would
i
recommend
rushing
out
to
buy
i
knocked
this
one
down
a
bit
in
the
drinkability
category
because
it
has
a
slightly
harsh
bite
in
the
aftertaste
that
is
unwarranted
the
beer
overall
is
pretty
good
although
i
dont
know
if
i
would
call
this
a
scotch
ale
since
it
does
not
really
have
that
burnt
or
smokey
straw
distinguishing
characteristic
this
is
a
medium
bodied
traditional
malty
winter
warmer
there
isnt
much
carbonation
the
head
is
a
very
nice
off
white
creamy
and
frothy
there
are
ruby
notes
to
this
beer
and
it
is
sufficiently
cloudy
to
add
some
intrigue
to
its
presentation
it
retains
and
laces
the
smell
is
dextrin
malt
maybe
a
hint
of
spice
in
the
allspice
family
the
taste
is
a
bit
complex
in
that
the
malty
sweetness
the
spices
the
butterscotch
notes
are
most
pronounced
on
the
front
end
the
hops
show
up
towards
the
finish
and
add
a
nice
balance
to
the
spices
the
slightly
off
aftertaste
detracts
from
an
otherwise
pretty
good
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
tilted
towards
the
dry
end
although
there
is
a
creaminess
to
this
beer
that
is
an
overall
asset
drinkability
is
moderate
it
is
a
malt
forward
beer
thats
a
touch
off
balance
for
me
its
not
interesting
but
it
is
quite
drinkable
winning
points
for
not
being
offensive
drinkability
a
very
drinkable
brew
full
bodied
without
being
heavy
pours
a
dark
amber
with
a
thick
lacy
offwhite
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
while
it
smells
of
roasted
malts
a
bit
of
hops
and
some
winter
spices
the
taste
is
good
as
well
nice
malty
base
with
some
hoppy
bitterness
to
balance
it
out
the
more
complex
spices
were
nice
mixed
in
between
the
two
and
had
some
hints
of
caramel
too
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
good
and
it
had
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
the
drinkability
was
pretty
good
as
well
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
before
i
retired
for
the
evening
had
this
one
in
the
winter
survival
pack
its
appearance
is
a
brownish
amber
with
a
nice
creamy
head
that
stays
along
after
awhile
its
smell
is
steadily
sharp
with
malts
and
spices
for
the
holiday
season
the
taste
is
a
little
off
from
the
smell
but
not
in
a
big
way
surprising
hints
of
caramel
with
those
hints
of
spice
really
dry
aftertaste
that
makes
it
pack
a
distinct
punch
but
is
also
not
expected
a
great
body
makes
this
thick
enough
to
last
you
for
the
winter
overall
a
straight
and
narrow
scottish
ale
d
average
i
enjoyed
the
artwork
on
the
bottle
more
than
the
beer
itself
but
overall
id
have
another
i
would
rather
go
for
the
double
bag
that
long
trail
offers
instead
not
your
typical
scottish
ale
but
still
pretty
good
this
ale
is
just
a
little
light
in
every
catagory
than
i
would
expect
out
of
a
scottish
ale
im
not
a
huge
long
trail
guy
but
the
more
i
try
their
product
the
more
i
become
a
fan
they
keep
putting
out
good
stuff
like
this
and
ill
be
an
even
bigger
fan
by
6
pack
end
d
it
goes
down
easy
and
is
nice
for
a
winter
beer
but
i
think
the
contrast
of
sweet
malts
coupled
with
spicy
finish
would
get
to
be
too
much
after
a
while
the
malts
come
in
smooth
and
then
the
finishes
throws
off
the
balance
overall
a
solid
choice
for
winter
certainly
a
decent
session
beer
but
i
was
expecting
something
a
little
more
interesting
from
a
winter
offering
that
spins
the
scottish
ale
style
pours
a
dark
ruby
brown
with
a
thin
white
head
that
fades
quickly
the
smell
was
somewhat
disappointing
i
wasnt
getting
too
much
from
it
it
smelled
sweet
and
malty
with
a
subtle
hop
aroma
the
taste
is
similar
with
a
good
deal
of
malty
flavor
with
sweet
notes
and
a
somewhat
bitter
finish
a
very
light
mouthfeel
i
was
expecting
something
heavier
but
a
good
balance
in
flavor
not
a
very
powerful
beer
but
enjoyable
this
is
an
easy
drinker
not
the
first
beer
i
would
choose
for
a
winter
beer
but
still
tasty
pours
a
very
dark
ruby
that
is
fully
clear
nose
is
very
perfumed
at
the
start
soap
is
also
there
after
a
very
short
while
it
turns
into
a
milder
sweet
toned
leafy
character
flavor
is
smoothly
sweet
with
that
perfume
coming
out
again
over
my
tongue
i
get
an
odd
aftertaste
that
is
like
someone
sprayed
perfume
in
my
mouth
odd
slightly
sticky
on
the
liquid
and
low
on
carbonation
overall
i
feel
like
this
is
a
new
world
scottish
ale
a
bit
too
hyper
and
vibrant
and
not
subdued
or
mature
enough
decent
enough
and
definitely
well
made
there
are
just
better
examples
of
the
style
out
there
d
definitely
a
drinkable
brew
tastes
very
good
especially
the
slight
honey
presence
in
the
aftertaste
goes
down
nice
and
smooth
making
for
a
nice
enjoyable

clean
with

of
the

try

in
the
sampler
was
this
one
pours
a
hazy
med
copper
color
w
a
very
thin
head
which
dissipates
rather
quickly
leaving
little
to
no
lacing
in
my
nonic
crap
noticed
an
oily
film
from
my
lip
balm
on
top
a
sweet
malty
smell
rich
w
alcohol
and
some
hop
and
diacetyl
undertones
starts
w
a
stronger
than
expected
hop
bite
followed
by
a
malty
alcoholic
whiskeylike
flavor
a
little
hop
flavor
present
as
well
a
med
body
w
slight
carbonation
true
to
style
feels
a
little
thick
w
all
the
hop
bitterness
lingering
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
just
a
little
too
hopped
for
the
style
mouthfeeldrinkability
the
mouthfeel
is
king
here
creamy
and
slick
its
almost
perfect
for
the
style
with
the
right
food
preferably
a
stew
or
some
slowcooked
crockpot
meal
this
would
be
great
a
beer
with
a
great
mouthfeel
and
balanced
flavor
im
not
a
big
fan
of
scottish
ales
but
this
one
is
pretty
good
d
would
have
liked
to
have
tasted
more
of
the
warming
alcohol
but
it
is
a
drinkable
beer
enjoyable
but
not
a
favorite
pours
a
dark
red
color
with
a
thin
head
aroma
is
a
bit
smoky
upfront
with
the
malt
showing
through
nicely
as
it
warms
up
this
aroma
gets
stronger
taste
is
smoky
on
the
tongue
with
a
nice
balance
showing
through
its
nice
and
subtle
and
not
your
typical
winter
beer
the
smokiness
isnt
overpowering
either
i
like
the
aftertaste
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
i
just
never
gave
it
this
much
thought
medium
almost
light
mouthfeelsmoothwith
a
bit
of
cloying
goes
down
easy
just
dont
think
it
a
beer
i
could
drink
more
than
a
couple
of
deep
copper
color
no
aroma
really
rather
metallic
and
plain
malty
enough
flavor
with
a
touch
of
bitterness
decent
enough
mouthfeel
overall
quite
average
or
maybe
better
could
use
a
more
pronounced
malt
flavor
and
lose
the
metallic
flavor
and
aroma
too
close
to
their
regular
ale
doesnt
really
compute
poured
a
redish
copper
color
and
with
a
slightly
forced
pour
got
a
two
finger
off
white
head
that
faded
to
just
covering
the
beer
with
some
lacing
caramel
and
roasted
malt
along
with
some
fruity
esters
for
smell
taste
lots
of
caramel
toasted
bread
very
sweet
but
i
could
not
pickup
on
the
honey
i
have
a
slight
cold
and
that
may
be
the
reason
mouthfeel

but
not

interested
taste
would
try
again
pours
an
orange
copper
color
with
an
attractive
offwhite
head
good
lacing
aromas
of
grainy
malt
spicy
fruit
and
some
hops
as
well
taste
is
great
big
bitter
malt
flavors
mild
hops
some
mellow
alcohol
notes
hits
the
tongue
along
with
spice
and
honey
this
is
a
great
ale
not
the
usual
scottish
but
with
a
great
twist
highly
drinkable
and
delicious
nice
label
artwork
too
i
cant
help
but
laugh
when
i
look
at
that
bear
all
cozy
near
the
fire
da
solid
well
made
ale
not
what
i
would
expect
from
scottish
ale
with
all
that
bitterness
but
the
malt
supports
it
well
also
it
is
really
dry
from
the
honey
addition
i
like
dry
beer
but
im
sure
most
people
expect
scottish
ale
to
have
a
higher
final
gravity
this
is
very
drinkable
and
a
solid
session
beer
poured
a
clear
mahogany
brown
with
a
tight
formed
one
finger
sized
white
head
leaving
a
broken
ring
of
lace
as
it
slowly
settledsomewhat
muted
aromas
mainly
sweeter
malt
like
that
of
brown
sugar
and
dark
fruit
there
was
a
hint
of
herbla
hop
but
it
was
faint
obviously
malt
tilted
and
pretty
basic
brown
sugar
and
caramel
sweetness
mainly
though
not
overly
sweet
a
touch
spicey
hp
comes
thru
in
a
rather
quick
finish
not
bad
its
drinkable
but
i
got
a
bit
bored
with
it
in
the
end
i
doubt
id
buy
it
again
drinkable
sure
but
little
of
interest
poured
into
pint
glass
a
dark
orangey
brown
color
with
a
slight
head
that
disappeared
quickly
slighty
warm
malty
aroma
looked
like
a
good
beer
taste
was
ok
but
not
what
i
was
expecting
for
the
beer
slighty
bitter
with
some
malts
and
a
hint
of
spicy
i
was
expecting
more
spices
very
easy
to
drink
and
felt
ok
in
the
mouth
not
a
bad
beer
and
since
its
fairly
easy
to
find
in
new
england
much
better
than
the
bmc
usually
on
tap
edit
after
posting
this
review
i
read
others
and
am
suprised
that
this
is
an
example
of
scottish
ale
maybe
the
ator
threw
me
a
curve
but
it
seems
more
bockish
to
me
so
there
12
pack
at
shaws
for
11
99
with
your
shaws
card
pours
dark
brown
very
little
head
retention
smells
quite
malty
tastes
quite
malty
some
hop
bitterness
in
the
back
with
spices
not
sure
what
kind
though
good
mouthfeel
overall
its
not
what
you
expect
for
a
winter
warmer
but
it
is
a
good
session
beer
not
too
bad
worth
looking
for
i
love
the
image
on
the
front
of
this
beer
makes
winter
seem
that
much
warmer
and
cozier
anyway
enough
about
that
the
beer
pours
a
nice
looking
copper
almost
ruby
color
with
a
small
white
laced
head
it
is
also
surprisingly
clear
with
champaigne
like
bubbles
floating
to
the
top
smell
is
of
dry
grain
doughy
bread
caramel
toast
not
bad
taste
lets
see
im
getting
more
of
the
toast
and
grain
flavors
with
a
mild
backing
of
chocolate
towards
the
end
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
bordering
on
light
perhaps
this
is
a
very
easy
beer
to
drink
for
the
cold
fall
and
winter
months
while
this
may
not
be
an
earth
shattering
beer
it
delivers
in
my
opinion
nothing
too
extreme
or
offensive
with
this
one
simply
a
beer
you
can
rely
on
i
wouldnt
mind
seeing
this
one
all
year
round
a
little
chewy
but
nice
as
it
warms
up
it
becomes
a
little
more
cozy
nice
mild
maltiness
with
a
slight
honey
kick
to
it
d
this
one
has
some
decent
flavor
to
it
isnt
as
filling
as
most
winter
releases
goes
down
quite
easily
most
winter
beers
are
typically
sippers
which
this
one
could
be
but
it
could
be
a
very
good
session
beer
as
well
especially
if
youre
ok
with
the
sweetness
clear
amberhued
copper
moderately
shortlived
head
the
nose
is
sweet
floral
vinous
with
notes
of
concord
grapes
the
palate
is
by
turns
malty
sweet
and
still
firmly
bitter
with
toasty
elements
combining
with
a
lingering
bitterness
into
the
finish
the
honey
while
fortifying
this
brew
does
contribute
to
a
mild
tartness
that
seems
to
chime
in
from
time
to
time
which
is
a
little
distracting
my
bottle
may
be
a
little
past
its
prime
but
im
guessing
that
this
beer
was
probably
not
too
much
more
than
a
decent
mostly
unoffensive
winter
offering
this
one
really
surprised
me
it
has
a
lot
going
on
there
is
a
very
consistant
soothingrefreshing
taste
that
is
quite
memorable
it
felt
lighter
to
me
then
many
of
its
scottish
counterparts
i
found
it
very
palitable
and
smooth
with
just
a
hint
of
tartness
overall
it
has
become
one
of
my
favorites
drinkability
a
great
session
beer
with
a
good
aftertaste
drinkability
nicely
drinkable
if
you
like
a
nice
malty
brew
try
it
everyone
will
have
a
different
opinion
on
this
one
benjamin
franklin
i
bought
a
12
oz
bottle
of
this
for
the
super
bowl
wonderful
dark
rich
color
a
nice
medium
head
that
sustained
itself
for
aroudn
6090
seconds
smelled
like
honey
tasted
good
quite
smooth
for
a
scottish
ale
overall
this
will
be
one
of
the
reasons
why
i
like
winter
next
year
body
is
medium
softly
carbonated
with
a
smooth
creamy
mouthfeel
and
cottony
texture
another
easy
drinker
mouthfeel
is
medium
in
body
and
is
mildly
carbonated
drinkability
after
several
sips
the
grapefruit
hops
interfere
with
the
nice
breadiness
i
would
probably
not
choose
to
drink
more
than
one
of
these
possibly
a
couple
d
i
like
this
and
enjoy
drinking
it
a
bit
more
bitterness
than
i
normally
like
but
this
one
isnt
over
hopped
so
the
bitterness
is
pretty
good
regardless
of
that
this
is
still
a
nice
brew
in
the
end
and
one
that
im
happy
to
pick
up
each
season
m
d
good
mouthfeel
with
a
whole
lot
of
malt
very
smooth
with
a
nice
aftertaste
thats
not
too
bitter
drinkability
is
pretty
good
this
definately
is
a
nice
winter
beer
happy
holidays
overall
great
beer
i
wish
they
made
this
yearround
when
i
can
get
it
for
9
99
a
twelvepack
at
the
grocery
its
a
winter
staple
in
my
beer
fridge
notes
from
the
bottle
hardy
and
robust
this
fullbodied
malty
brew
with
a
smooth
finish
features
a
blend
of
6
malts
and
a
dash
of
honey
a
great
winter
warmer
this
pours
a
dark
coppery
colorit
looks
like
a
glass
of
maple
syrupbut
the
head
is
a

smallish
the
smell

a
little
floralbut
its
mostly
a
sweet

scent
with
roasted

very
creamy
and
finishes
with
alot
of
hoppiness
the
mf
isnt
as
well
balanced
as
i
would
like
it
does
have
a
slight
watery
aftertastebut
this
is
a
good
beer
from
my
favorite
vermont
brewer
poured
a
crystal
clear
medium
copper
color
with
respectable
tannish
head
that
slowly
fell
leaving
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
smell
is
big
and
malty
with
nice
tones
of
dark
fruits
taste
is
a
bit
suprising
with
a
strong
hop
character
overpowering
the
promises
of
of
malt
in
the
nose
though
it
does
taste
good
finished
with
a
nice
blend
of
the
malt
and
hops
giving
a
nice
combination
ending
very
pleasing
to
drink
quite
enjoyable
i
have
wanted
for
some
time
to
try
this
delightful
brew
now
that
i
have
i
can
say
it
was
worth
the
wait
this
is
a
nice
entry
level
scotch
ale
balanced
to
the
malt
side
of
the
family
tree
with
a
fruity
peaty
floral
nose
and
a
tan
head
that
leaves
nice
lacing
overall
a
nice
winter
brew
to
enjoy
with
friends
no
this
is
not
a
thick
and
rich
scots
ale
but
it
is
a
nice
intro
to
the
style
and
great
to
enjoy
if
you
are
having
more
than
one
hibernator

a
reddish
amber

thin

slightly
hoppy
but
mostly
floral

some
malty

sweet
with
some
nuttiness
with
a
definite
contribution
from
the
honey
used
in
this
brew
showing
up
in
the
finish
not
overly
sweet
but
not
bone
dry
either
fine
carbonation
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
but
i
dont
know
how
well
it
fits
the
definition
of
scottish
ale
this
shouldnt
keep
you
from
giving
it
a
try
though
oh
yeah
i
could
definitely
spend
a
cold

night
curled
up
in

adertized

picked
up
on
the
palate
decent
sessioner
but
not
much
more
nothing
more
than
an
average
ale
imo
good
flavors
slightly
unbalanced
nothing
unpleasant
regarding
flavor
but
nothing
special
either
ill
pass
on
this
one
next
time
this
beer
strikes
a
fairly
impressive
image
a
beautiful
dark
ruby
color
it
has
a
small
head
but
it
sticks
around
forever
and
leaves
a
great
lacing
on
the
side
of
the
glass
the
aroma
isnt
very
strong
whats
there
is
obviously
very
malty
but
also
earthy
in
a
very
scotchale
type
way
the
taste
is
very
malty
with
a
wet
earth
touch
in
the
background
there
is
the
tiniest
amount
of
hop
bitterness
at
the
finsih
but
is
almost
indetectable
the
malt
rules
here
as
it
should
in
a
scotch
ale
theres
a
slight
metallic
taste
in
the
finish
but
it
isnt
strong
enough
to
detract
from
the
overall
experience
it
has
a
fairly
full
mouthfeel
which
is
appropriate
the
drinkability
is
ok
but
since
ive
discovered
a
love
of
the
hops
i
yearn
for
a
bit
more
bitterness
to
cut
through
the
malt
sweetness
happy
hibernation
thanks
to
the
monk
for
trading
up
some
scraps
from
his
mighty
beer
table
light
to
medium
body
with
some
good
carbonation
in
here
to
make
it
a
soft
brew
this
could
go
down
a
little
too
quick
quite
an
enjoyable
scotch
without
the
cloying
sweetness
in
it
a
nice
winter
pick
pours
a
dark
amber
with
lighter
tints
and
a
slight
fizzy
head
smells
of
slight
floral
notes
bits
of
honey
and
butterscotch
very
subtle

to
this

the

with

mellow

of
honey
and

thanks
to
pbrian
for
this
one
beer
was
bottled
on
11062003
and
was
a
12
oz
a
perfectly
respectable
winter
beer
nice
little
entry
from
these
guys
and
thanks
go
to
rabidawg
for
providing
light
cream
colored
head
that
leaves
just
a
tad
of
lacing
the
color
is
somewhere
between
a
dark
copper
and
a
ruby
bronze
it
smells
like
skunky
hops
not
all
that
appealing
the
flavor
is
not
too
strong
mostly
hops
that
are
just
barely
bitter
a
bit
of
burnt
malt
and
butterscotch
hold
it
back
the
body
is
light
and
the
beer
is
pretty
carbonated
its
almost
like
swallowing
a
frothy
beer
overall
not
bad
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
there
are
better
winter
brews
out
there
i
might
have
been
expecting
too
much
with
the
ator
name
i
wasnt
expecting
a
doppel
but
i
did
want
something
more
than
this
drinkability
a
nice
winter
ale
somewhat
lacking
in
body
but
a
hell
of
a
sniff
between
sips
notes
a
more
than
decent
pick
for
the
big
influx
of
winter
brews
in
this
year
2003
just
enough
hops
to
tame
the
body
quite
an
enjoyable
malty
brew
the
taste
is
what
i
was
hoping
the
harvset
would
be
but
wasnt
lots
of
sweet
caramel
and
toasted
malt
with
a
underlying
sweetness
of
citrus
and
sugar
slighlty
buttery
and
chewy
in
texture
very
nice
mouthfeel
super
smooth
moderately
weak
hop
finish
but
enough
to
balance
all
that
malt
great
beer
tastes
spicy
and
sweet
fruity
with
those
smooth
honey
flavors
underneath
it
all
medium
bodied
with
a
light
hoppy
finish
sour
aftertaste
good
winterholiday
beer
but
not
outstanding
would
rather
have
a
harvest
ale
given
my
choice
a
bit
too
sweet
happened
upon
this
brew
in
a
lost
little
store
in
the
middle
of
nowhere
being
a
cold
night
i
figured
it
was
only
appropriate
i
pick
some
up
pours
a
deep
honey
amber
color
with
a
quick
ivory
head
aroma
is
malty
and
sharp
with
a
hint
of
honey
and
bread
the
flavor
is
initailly
sharp
with
a
toffee
undertone
and
an
aggressive
bitterness
the
sharpness
smoothes
off
a
bit
with
a
bold
alcoholic
warmth
ebbing
into
a
coffee
finish
this
brew
leaves
quite
an
impression
on
the
palate
good
for
warmth
but
a
bit
too
sharp
for
a
warmer
evening
this
beer
poured
a
orangebrown
with
red
highlights
when
held
to
the
light
it
was
very
clear
and
well
carbonated
the
head
was
a
medium
brown
and
was
chunky
creamy
and
foamy
and
this
was
also
mirrored
in
the
lace
that
it
left
behind
the
aromas
that
came
from
the
glass
were
of
sweet
malt
hops
brown
sugar
herbs
and
a
very
slight
sweet
honey
appeal
not
overly
impressive
considering
the
label
stated
that
it
would
be
the
tastes
that
came
from
the
glass
were
of
hops

floral
and
citrus
very
slight
a
carbonation
bite
sweet
malt
watery
feel
pine
trees
flowers
slight
lemons
roasted
nut
barley
when
it
warmed
breadyeast
slight
and
a
slight
alcohol
warmed
the
aftertaste
was
hops
and
slightly
dry
i
tasted
more
hops
in
this
beer
then
malt
even
though
the
label
stated
that
it
used
5
malts
in
the
brew
process
i
noticed
the
malts
more
in
the
nose
then
on
the
tongue
and
as
for
the
honey
i
only
detected
a
small
hint
in
the
nose
and
none
on
the
pallet
medium
bodied
but
i
was
hoping
for
more
a
better
then
average
beer
but
imo
not
a
great
example
of
a
scotch
strong
ale
has
a
nice
dark
amber
color
pours
a
nice
12
head
which
thins
out
but
never
disappears
spicey
aroma
with
a
very
little
licoricey
taste
even
though
i
dont
think
they
add
either
very
tasty
winter
brew
that
is
not
too
cloying
or
overly
spiced
you
can
drink
a
few
of
these
at
a
sitting
got
them
for
11
99
a
12
pack
so
you
cant
beat
the
price
always
love
going
to
vermont
and
having
my
cousin
pull
one
out
of
the
fridge
lets
me
know
im
in
vermont
excelent
carbination
levels
the
label
has
a
nice
by
the
fire
scene
of
a
bear
presumably
doing
what
all
of
us
would
like
to
do
in
the
winter
by
hibernating
the
beer
was
a
nice
treat
after
sledding
all

the
aroma
is
of
malt
the

taste
reveals
wheat

malt
lots
of
it
the
taste
seems
very
complex
very

hibernator

out

the
coldest

leave
it

to
be
between
6
and

on
this
one
nice
aroma
of
spices
sweet
malts
and
hops
that
is
just
perfect
for
the
winter
season
lots
of
malts
and
spices
dominate
the
flavor
of
this
beer
it
has
a
nice
warming
character
that
makes
it
a
great
winter
drinker
very
smooth
with
a
nice
rich
body
it
goes
down
great
sooo
drinkable
a
toasty
malt
flavor
starts
off
with
caramel
toffee
and
a
very
slight
diacetyl
flavor
rounding
things
out
it
starts
to
get
a
bit
more
bitter
mid
sip
and
finishes
like
a
more
bitter
slightly
drier
version
of
the
start
with
added
hints
of
cocoa
and
slight
hop
spiciness
the
flavors
are
very
very
clean
no
off
flavors
at
all
the
mouthfeel
is
a
touch
on
the
light
side
but
it
makes
this
brew
massively
drinkable
one
of
my
favorite
winter
seasonals
primarily
because
it
lends
itself
to
daylong
consumption
and
ill
never
tire
of
the

out
a

on

pretty
good
beer
but
not
one
of
my
favorite
winter
beers
pours
a
deep
copper
color
with
a
big
creamy
tan
head
that
lasts
forever
and
leaves
a
great
looking
lace
all
the
way
down
the
sides
of
the
glass
huge
creamy
and
sweet
maltiness
dominates
the
nose
of
this
brew
with
some
spicy
alcohol
notes
thrown
into
the
background
for
good
measure
smooth
and
sweet
maltiness
all
the
way
to
the
end
there
are
faint
smoky
peat
flavors
that
linger
only
for
a
second
before
being
swept
away
by
the
finishing
alcohol
spiciness
greatly
creamt
this
brew
remains
very
drinkable
throughout
i
would
highly
recommend
this
one
to
anyone
who
can
get
their
hands
on
it
a
touch
of
honey
on
the
nose
a
bit
of
the
signature
long
trail
toastiness
on
the
tongue
but
that
and
the
hops
are
overwhelmed
by
the
malt
and
honey
sweetness
the
first
one
is
quite
enjoyable
the
second
one
is
hard
to
finish
due
to
this
mouthcoating
sweetness
i
liked
this
alot
it
is
everything
i
want
from
a
winter
brew
if
i
was
a
bear
this
is
what
i
would
stock
my
cave
with
for
the
winter
likely
some
of
the
same
notescomparisons
on
this
beer
as
others
poured
from
a
12oz

into

snifter

this
beer
was
a
real
looker
deep
mahogany
tones
blood
red
shone
through
when
held
in
the
light
nicest
aspect
by
far
malt
to
the
nose
and
about
only
that
some
oak
to
taste
a
bit
maltforward
but
not
heavy
seemed
light
for
the
style
a
bit
watery
but
somewhat
redeemed
by
the
crispness
overall
a
bit
lacking
in
the
right
situation
like
a
lawnmowing
adventure
long
day
of
sessioning
homebrewing
fishing
this
might
actually
hit
the
spot
on
a
work
night
when
i
limit
myself
to
one
beer
i
would
rather
reach
for
something
a
bit
more
substantial
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
decent
beer
and
a
pretty
standard
example
of
the
style
it
had
some
of
those
nice
flavors
and
aromas
that
i
look
for
in
the
style
but
it
also
had
some
off
aspects
that
held
it
back
from
being
as
good
as
it
could
be
this
beer
had
ok
drinkability
it
was
smooth
clean
and
not
filing
but
the
carbonation
and
lack
of
depth
might
start
to
wear
on
me
but
the
body
does
make
it
more
drinkable
than
most
of
the
style
what
i
liked
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
aroma
i
thought
it
was
pretty
nice
and
true
to
style
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
the
mouthfeel
it
was
just
a
little
thin
and
it
was
too
crisp
for
the
style
i
dont
think
i
would
buy
this
again
if
im
in
the
mood
for
the
style
i
would
rather
have
a
dirty
bastard
i
dont
think
i
would
recommend
this
beer
since
there
are
many
other
scottish
ales
that
are
better
all
in
all
i
thought
this
beer
fell
right
about
in
the
middle
it
wasnt
a
bad
beer
but
it
lacked
the
mouthfeel
and
depth
that
a
good
scottish
ale
has
i
think
with
a
little
bit
of
work
this
could
be
a
pretty
good
beer
overall
this
is
really
middle
of
the
road
it
easy
drinking
but
just
not
much
flavor
this
is
an
okay
scotch
ale
it
certainly
hints
to
the
nuances
of
the
style
but
keeps
it
fairly
subtle
smooth
and
easy
drinking
beer
this
is
pretty
good
considering
the
style
is
one
that
you
dont
really
see
too
often
not
to
mention
the
quality
of
the
brew
amber

propelled
me
into

can

the

rolls

o
this

is
much
better
when
the

hasnt
been
compromised
decent
overall
id
like
to
see
some
more
of
the
traditional
scottish
attributes
while
i
know
this
isnt
meant
to
be
a
wee
heavy
i
think
they
could
still
get
some
more
smokey
notes

the

a

round
out
the

could
use
more
hops
mouthfeel
is
the
best
part
of
the
beer
fairly
thick
but
silky
smooth
and
as
drinkable
as
the
best
of
them
overall
this
is
a
failure
its
an
average
amber
maybe
slightly
below

even
in
that
genre
the
maker
of
this

has
no

nothing
in
this
is

roasty

a
mellow
blend

sweetness
perhaps
a
touch
of
honey
and
the
oak
is
hardly
noticeable
but
present
not
a
hop
in

nor
peat
which
is
a
slight
disappointment
once
i
start
to
sip
i
can
detect
a
slight

bitterness
and
a
bit

flavors
in

are
quite
simple
sweet
malts
and
a
touch

the
oak
presents
itself
but
if
i
had
not
read
about
it
i
might
not
have
noticed
the
thin

is
a
turnoff
for
me
but
the
medium
carbonation
level
saves
it
from
disaster
this
is
a
pretty

example
of
a
wonderful

better
examples

the
taste
is
nice
what
you
expect
from
the

it
starts
with
a
light
carbonation
on
the
tongue
sweet
malty
caramel
with
an
sweet
oaky
finish
the
mouth
is
very
smooth
throughout
not
harsh
in

and
the
oak
sets
it
apart
from
