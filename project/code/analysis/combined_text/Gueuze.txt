oit
is
great
to
see
such
fine
gueuze
being
brewed
in
the
us
very
enjoyable
o
a
nice
treat
to
try
not
every
day
you
get
to
try
a
straight
lambic
on
draft
i
would
prefer
a
bit
more
tartness
and
less
woody
dryness
but
all
in
all
another
solid
offering
from
bullfrogs
sour
program
i
seriously
doubted
the
comparisons
to
belgian
gueuze
but
i
was
wrong
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
american
sours
and
gives
me
great
hope
for
americas
sour
future
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
it
has
a
really
solid
blend
of
sourness
verse
funk
and
earth
i
was
a
little
surprised
by
the
bitter
herbal
notes
but
that
aspect
of
it
was
very
similar
in
my
opinion
to
fresh
drie
fonteinen
i
cant
wait
to
get
into
the
bottled
version
of
this
blend
5
a
big
thanks
to
mgirard
for
sharing
this
with
me
intensely
tart
and
sour
without
a
trace
of
vinegar
delicious
fruity
very
sour
cant
imagine
drinking
a
whole
glass
of
this
my
teeth
hurt
after
2oz
5
4
25
i
absolutely
loved
this
beer
and
while
i
havent
been
a
fan
of
the
other
uplands
i
have
had
this
one
vaulted
to
the
top
of
the
sours
i
have
had
so
far
on
par
with
duckduckgooze
batch
5
yellowstraw
color
with
a
slight
haze
lots
of
bubbles
rising
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
feeding
a
wispy
white
head
at
the
top
minimal
lacing
in
the
nose
lactolemon
apple
skin
hints
of
sulfur
and
crackery
malts
pretty
darn
sour
on
the
palate
lacto
lemon
and
apple
acidity
moderate
notes
of
sulfur
yogurt
cobwebs
some
acetic
puckeriness
oak
dried
leaves
and
distant
crackery
malts
in
the
background
medium
body
dry
and
acidic
mouthfeel
lively
carbonation
interesting
to
call
this
a
gueuze
but
i
guess
the
brewingblending
process
makes
it
that
regardless
a
solid
and
enjoyable
sour
overall
id
like
to
try
it
with
a
few
years
on
it
overall
very
enjoyable
beer
that
is
extremely
sour
but
adds
just
enough
more
on
top
of
the
acidity
that
its
not
just
a
sour
bomb
but
is
fairly
complex
enjoyed
the
stonefruit
flavours
and
the
dry
oak
finish
on
this
beer
upland
is
the
real
deal
pours
a
murky
honey
orangebrown
with
a
foamy
beige
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
slowly
drip
into
the
remaining
beer
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
super
sour
with
malt
fruit
vinegar
and
acidic
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
sour
fruit
and
vinegar
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
medium
amount
of
acidity
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
with
an
awesome
set
of
aromas
and
flavors
coming
from
this
blend
of
barrels
overall
i
cant
taste
much
beyond
the
sourness
amen
to
southhouse
brew
the
best
gueuze
ive
ever
had
when
caleb
gets
a
sour
right
its
right
i
love
all
of
the
uplands
that
ive
had
ive
had
them
side
by
side
with
the
russian
riverscascades
cantillonsand
drie
fonteinens
upland
is
world
class
this
is
for
batch
2
and
3
batch
3
this
seems
like
a
nice
enough
capstone
for
the
evening
eh
it
pours
a
cloudy
sunset
strawamber
topped
by
a
halffinger
or
so
of
lightly
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
tart
lemon
zest
light
vinegar
light
funk
and
orange
juice
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
some
hefty
sourness
and
a
few
veins
of
slightlysweeter
red
wine
vinegar
every
now
and
again
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
dry
sticky
finish
overall
a
damn
fine
sour
one
that
brings
the
tartness
with
a
vengeance
not
a
bad
beer
to
finish
the
day
off
with
a
very
sour
beer
if
youre
into
such
beers
youll
enjoy
it
if
not
this
is
an
intensely
sour
beer
o
best
american
sour
ive
had
and
certainly
the
best
example
of
an
american
gueuze
out
there
batch
3
is
better
than
batch
two
and
is
a
damn
near
perfect
beer
its
a
privilege
to
live
so
close
to
a
brewery
producing
such
a
great
product
overall
one
of
the
most
complete
and
rewarding
sours
out
there
more
refined
more
soulful
than
anything
else
on
the
market
not
quite
as
lifechanging
as
last
years
reserve
however
you
want
to
drink
this
cold
and
fresh
because
it
doesnt
sit
will
in
the
hand
changeable
mercurial
which
is
not
always
a
bad
thing
were
still
saying
its
really
good
even
as
we
feel
a
little
letdown
batch
2
pour
is
glowing
orange
light
haze
and
tight
white
head
nose
is
orange
citrus
and
tangerine
juicy
wine
and
barrel
light
musk
and
cheese
and
seemingly
acetic
taste
is
juicy
oily
orange
citrus
and
tangerine
wine
barrel
and
oak
light
cheese
moving
to
acetic
acid
burn
in
finish
not
horrible
but
increasing
semi
dry
assertive
carbonation
and
a
bit
heavy
on
the
body
a
very
solid
beer
all
the
way
around
and
pretty
inline
with
the
rest
of
uplands
wild
offerings
certainly
worth
trying
t
this
is
a
gueuze
that
leans
more
to
the
tart
side
than
the
funky
side
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
tarter
beers
that
ive
ever
had
its
a
mouth
puckerer
o
this
definitely
surpasses
most
american
wilds
in
terms
of
complexity
but
unfortunately
the
vinegary
acetic
character
is
getting
a
bit
too
strong
at
least
in
this
bottle
i
will
definitely
seek
out
future
blends
if
this
is
any
indication
of
the
programs
potential
but
right
now
there
are
some
glitches
to
work
out
o
considering
i
enjoyed
this
on
zwanze
day
and
im
considering
it
the
best
sour
beer
ive
had
today
thats
really
saying
a
lot
i
cannot
say
enough
how
delicious
this
beer
was
i
almost
wish
i
didnt
share
it
with
everybody
almost
5
oa
wonderful
sour
great
sour
notes
balance
is
perfect
not
a
shock
this
won
a
gold
medal
at
gabf
been
about
6
months
since
i
tried
b1
which
i
remember
being
even
better
than
this
regardless
this
batch
of
sour
reserve
is
a
fantastic
american
sour
worthy
of
anyall
hype
it
receives
recommended
had
the
pleasure
of
tasting
this
gem
of
limited
production
at
a
buddys
tasting
it
had
a
difficult
task
of
standing
out
against
some
other
phenomenal
beers
that
evening
including
hunah
20yr
elijah
choclate
rain
duck
duck
gooze
and
others
it
did
so
with
force
it
is
very
taste
forward
with
lots
of
tart
aroma
to
boot
only
downfall
to
this
amazing
beer
is
that
its
finish
is
short
relative
to
other
sours
and
the
great
taste
quickly
dissipates
i
would
recommend
that
if
you
can
find
one
buy
one
hell
buy
ten
it
wont
disappoint
cheers
drink
it
was
good
but
needed
to
be
a
few
steps
up
for
what
i
believe
this
bottle
is
considered
i
would
like
another
bottle
to
sit
on
for
a
couple
years
overall
a
very
good
sour
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
the
exact
flavor
profiles
but
they
balance
very
nicely
a
very
good
sour
with
another
in
the
cellar
to
age
this
one
was
shared
during
the
upland
sour
tasting
where
all
of
the
fruit
lambics
were
present
as
well
as
a
massive
group
of
bas
to
share
it
all
batch
1
served
from
bottle
into
a
boulevard
tulip
poured
bright
orange
with
a
half
finger
white
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
quickly
maintained
nice
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
funk
sour
tart
peach
and
fruit
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
funk
sour
tart
orange
peel
orange
and
fruit
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
high
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
good
brew
this
was
the
last
beer
of
the
evening
and
we
definitely
saved
the
best
for
last
in
my
opinion
loads
of
complexity
to
be
found
here
while
still
being
refreshing
and
intriguing
it
was
completely
different
from
the
fruit
lambics
by
them
so
dont
go
into
this
one
expecting
them
to
be
similar
just
a
heads
up
definitely
worth
seeking
out
whether
it
be
batch
1
or
2
o
really
welldone
and
very
enjoyable
i
felt
batch
2
was
more
balanced
with
better
fruit
tart
notes
while
batch
1
was
muddled
a
bit
i
would
drink
this
again
no
doubt
sour
aroma
of
cider
vinegar
tastes
fairly
acetic
follows
the
aroma
with
some
bright
citrus
and
tempered
sweetness
even
white
grape
minerality
maybe
some
iron
notes
in
the
background
lower
carbonation
bright
clean
and
quenching
overall
pretty
good
would
liked
to
see
more
complexity
but
it
was
enjoyable
beer
is
light
in
body
not
as
sour
as
expected
flat
a
little
on
the
palate
mlid
earthiness
sulfur
decent
finihs
a
fine
beer
but
not
a
great
gueuze
the
beer
is
hazy
and
light
orange
colored
with
a
small
fleeting
wispy
head
nice
aroma
consisting
of
wild
yeast
citrus
grass
wheat
acetic
and
lactic
feel
on
the
palate
with
low
carbonation
pretty
good
flavor
definitely
smells
and
tastes
like
an
upland
beer
very
good
but
not
world
class
definitely
one
of
the
better
gueuze
examples
to
emerge
from
the
u
s
pours
a
deep
golden
color
with
a
short
white
head
that
fizzes
out
quickly
and
doesnt
leave
anything
behind
the
nose
carries
some
strong
lactic
notes
with
just
a
touch
of
stone
fruits
in
the
background
flavor
is
similar
with
more
fruit
coming
out
as
it
warms
light
body
with
heavy
lactic
acid
through
the
finish
very
dry
gets
better
as
it
warms
but
the
focus
is
too
much
on
acidity
without
the
underlying
funk
earthiness
and
complexity
tasty
though
the
enamelripping
sourness
could
be
toned
down
a
bit
its
nice
to
smack
your
taste
buds
into
submission
every
now
and
then
though
caleb
nailed
this
one
i
wish
i
had
more
than
1
bottle
very
pleasant
sourness
without
being
over
the
top
and
hands
down
the
winner
of
our
sour
tasting
overall
as
a
gueuze
its
pretty
mediocre
but
as
a
american
wild
ale
its
very
solid
really
enjoyed
this
batch
2
over
the
batch
1
i
had
earlier
in
the
year
flavor
profile
is
much
more
lively
and
open
o
great
beer
too
bad
it
was
one
of
only
300
bottles
i
will
make
sure
to
get
this
again
if
the
release
another
batch
in
the
future
i
am
optimistic
as
the
label
states
it
is
batch
1
d
as
a
gueuze
its
pretty
mediocire
but
as
a
american
wild
ale
its
pretty
solid
too
rare
for
what
it
delivers
but
easy
and
enjoyable
to
drink
hopefully
they
make
more
next
time
pours
a
turbid
golden
orange
color
with
no
head
lacto
and
light
citrus
on
the
nose
minimal
funk
and
grass
more
sweet
and
fruity
than
sour
or
funky
but
pleasantly
acidic
oak
is
present
from
the
start
and
fades
through
the
finish
medium
thick
and
high
carbonation
produces
a
full
body
straddling
rating
this
much
lower
as
a
gauze
and
a
little
higher
as
a
pleasant
american
wild
regardless
an
enjoyable
surprise
compared
to
most
of
their
fruit
lambics
pretty
tasty
overall
especially
viewed
as
an
american
sour
and
not
a
gueuze
im
a
sucker
for
acidic
unfruited
sours
so
this
is
a
treat
i
had
a
small
problem
finishing
off
the
last
ounce
or
two
of
my
12
ounce
pour
due
to
the
acidity
which
is
the
only
reason
this
is
not
a
4
5
in
taste
or
overall
the
pour
is
a
murky
orangeish
color
with
a
finger
of
white
head
smells
intensely
lactic
and
lemony
quite
a
bit
of
lemon
peel
and
green
apple
maybe
a
little
bit
of
funk
hay
and
grass
a
few
notes
of
oak
too
the
flavor
is
similarly
heavy
on
the
lemon
tartness
and
lactic
acidity
minimal
funk
notes
maybe
a
touch
of
vinegar
medium
body
and
medium
to
high
carbonation
better
than
many
of
the
other
upland
lambic
releases
pretty
bad
appearance
pouring
an
extremely
turbid
and
opaque
straw
color
with
a
head
that
fizzles
away
quickly
a
lot
of
lacto
on
the
nose
along
with
some
nice
tropical
fruit
character
faint
acetone
and
aceto
palate
is
good
but
somewhat
stomach
churning
heavy
on
the
lactic
sourness
pineapple
and
lemon
fruitiness
lends
some
depth
fair
bit
of
oak
hits
the
palate
up
front
but
doesnt
linger
into
the
finish
the
finish
is
quite
brief
actually
very
lactic
and
somewhat
yogurty
the
acidity
is
felt
going
down
which
makes
it
somewhat
of
a
chore
to
drink
after
a
while
though
its
a
pretty
decent
beer
in
small
quantities
reminds
me
a
bit
of
duck
duck
gooze
but
its
a
step
down
from
that
beer
overall
a
excellent
brew
really
well
done
overall
this
beer
just
impressed
me
greatly
it
falls
just
behind
beatification
in
terms
of
american
made
gueuze
style
beers
if
the
most
recent
fruit
lambic
release
and
now
the
sour
reserve
release
is
any
indication
on
how
the
sour
program
is
progressing
at
upland
im
very
excited
to
see
what
is
next
overall
decent
beer
there
is
something
about
uplands
house
yeast
strain
that
rubs
me
the
wrong
way
some
elements
are
good
4
0
and
others
are
slightly
less
than
good
with
it
being
in
the
gueuze
category
i
feel
a
bit
generous
rated
to
style
against
many
belgians
it
might
not
break
3
pours
a
semi
deep
golden
color
aromas
are
very
complex
with
a
cheesy
barnyard
acidic
quality
to
it
really
incredible
taste
is
bretty
fruit
with
some
kiwi
soured
apples
persimmon
and
highly
acidic
very
very
sour
but
not
over
the
top
finish
is
long
lasting
and
complex
overall
this
might
supplant
the
persimmon
as
my
top
upland
sour
beer
very
nicely
done
o
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
fantastic
beer
ive
had
all
of
uplands
lambics
and
their
dantalion
wild
ale
and
this
is
by
far
the
best
sour
theyve
done
tons
of
brett
and
sour
fruits
in
the
nose
and
taste
and
i
felt
like
i
could
have
taken
down
the
whole
750ml
bottle
myself
and
would
want
to
very
glad
i
have
a
bottle
of
this
and
will
surely
be
looking
forward
to
their
next
reserve
release
big
ups
to
ma
boy
backfat
me
for
busting
open
this
gem
i
was
really
looking
forward
to
opening
to
rarity
the
pour
is
a
clouded
yellowish
golden
cider
smell
is
sharp
and
cheesy
bright
fruits
bretty
funk
and
lovely
apple
characteristics
all
dominant
the
nose
taste
follows
the
nose
with
lots
of
acidic
granny
smith
apples
and
delicious
musty
funk
dry
and
great
beer
as
suspected
this
tastes
old
spritzy
and
fantastic
hopefully
the
bottle
variation
isnt
as
nuts
as
their
other
releases
this
is
my
favorite
upland
release
so
far
and
right
up
there
with
certain
batches
of
kiwi
persimmon
blackberry
and
raspberry
thanks
to
dave
backfat
for
opening
this
one
so
i
didnt
have
to
open
mine
haha
this
beer
pours
an
interesting
and
cloudy
gold
in
color
with
a
white
lacing
around
my
glass
it
smells
of
a
concoction
of
uplands
lambics
and
is
heavy
on
persimmon
and
kiwi
especially
which
is
fine
their
two
best
in
my
opinion
it
is
very
fruit
forward
before
going
into
a
nice
and
clean
lactic
sour
the
flavor
is
fruit
forward
too
and
again
heavy
on
persimmon
and
kiwi
with
some
slight
butter
ala
california
chardonnay
it
drinks
light
and
effervescent
sp
and
is
pretty
clean
with
a
light
and
subtly
dry
finish
overall
id
say
its
uplands
finest
behind
their
persimmon
lambic
pours
light
golden
in
color
with
a
thin
white
head
smell
has
funky
aromas
of
brett
hints
of
grainy
malt
and
some
barnyard
aromas
taste
is
very
tart
with
brett
flavors
of
barnyard
hay
and
funk
very
crisp
light
and
refreshing
with
some
stickiness
from
the
sour
pours
a
golden
hue
with
a
fluffy
white
two
finger
head
and
sporadic
lacing
smell
is
oak
funk
and
white
grapes
all
the
usual
suspects
i
expect
feel
is
medium
bodied
with
lively
spritzy
carbonation
with
tastes
of
white
grapes
sour
meyer
lemons
but
not
too
sour
oak
and
finished
with
a
dry
funkiness
and
overall
another
well
executed
brew
by
the
man
cheers
watery
body
but
it
works
well
with
these
flavours
serving
type
bottle
overall
pretty
nice
with
a
distinct
lambic
flavor
very
nice
overall
really
nice
sour
ale
though
if
it
wasnt
printed
on
the
label
i
wouldnt
have
guessed
that
it
was
spontaneously
fermented
also
i
dont
believe
they
followed
the
grain
bill
for
a
lambic
or
that
this
is
a
blend
of
young
and
old
beer
so
im
not
sure
the
classification
as
a
gueuze
is
all
that
accurate
on
the
high
side
of
the
sour
range
with
a
lot
of
green
apple
and
white
grape
fruit
character
paired
with
oak
and
some
heavy
funk
the
acidity
sort
ends
up
being
dominant
to
most
of
the
other
flavors
light
bodied
throughout
dryness
is
celebrated
from
start
to
finish
as
its
sheer
acidity
strips
the
thirst
from
the
palate
and
ushers
in
a
highly
refreshing
taste
leaving
the
mouth
with
sharp
astringency
and
the
ironside
taste
of
sea
brine
hues
is
allllmost
great
the
initial
pour
and
aroma
are
superb
deep
complex
funk
lemons
and
bright
peach
notes
on
the
palate
this
is
just
a
hair
sweet
which
gives
this
a
slightly
flat
sweetsour
dynamic
its
excellent
and
very
drinkable
with
hints
of
oak
and
cognac
but
a
bit
more
depth
and
complexity
would
be
welcome
im
hopeful
enough
i
plan
to
pick
up
a
few
more
bottles
to
set
aside
a
very
easy
drinking
geueze
with
a
whole
lot
of
complexity
and
earthiness
in
the
yeast
component
but
without
the
intense
sourness
that
usuakky
ges
with
the
style
counterpoint
that
with
the
fact
it
is
not
an
entry
level
style
either
no
sweetness
at
all
funky
smelled
of
ass
and
barnyard
with
feet
flavor
with
bitter
and
resinygrassy
hoppy
not
my
favorite
amazing
just
downright
awesome
sour
ale
here
been
looking
forward
to
one
day
trying
this
for
some
time
now
clay
station
hooked
it
up
maybe
age
has
helped
this
because
its
not
scored
real
highly
on
here
but
its
drinking
like
a
real
champ
laic
style
sour
hazy
blind
but
with
a
little
pale
orange
in
it
and
a
short
but
permanent
quarter
inch
of
white
bubbles
that
keep
popping
in
the
surface
but
being
replace
by
new
ones
on
the
bottom
a
wonderful
nose
acidic
and
mouthwatering
as
they
come
but
also
loaded
with
musty
oak
character
and
lactic
tartness
as
well
as
robust
wheat
malt
hard
to
beat
this
smell
for
me
its
everything
i
look
for
in
the
style
and
nothing
i
dont
the
flavor
shows
the
richness
and
nuance
of
gueuze
like
a
blend
that
brings
it
all
out
but
as
far
as
i
know
this
is
unblended
which
makes
it
that
much
more
impressive
funk
before
sour
on
the
palate
and
its
nowhere
near
as
acidic
as
the
nose
suggests
but
still
puckers
me
up
pretty
good
drying
mid
tongue
acidity
not
sharp
though
because
the
oak
here
is
so
enormous
its
infused
the
beer
with
an
earthen
unity
that
carries
all
the
way
through
i
am
so
impressed
by
the
depth
here
and
all
the
body
that
i
usually
wish
for
in
lambic
types
it
also
has
way
more
carbonation
than
most
short
of
explosive
but
not
by
much
it
remains
infinitely
drinkably
partially
due
to
that
but
also
in
large
part
due
to
how
darn
intriguing
it
is
far
better
than
so
many
of
its
variants
with
the
fruit
which
i
think
in
some
cases
kill
the
crispness
of
this
kill
its
simplistic
yet
layered
nature
wash
out
the
subtleties
not
here
bold
and
robust
but
also
reserved
i
love
everything
about
it
especially
the
long
dry
constantly
changing
finish
this
is
as
good
as
any
wild
ale
in
the
game
overall
good
beer
but
pretty
basic
and
unremarkable
if
you
like
gueuze
youll
enjoy
it
but
i
see
no
reason
to
seek
it
out
lots
of
cheaper
tastier
and
easier
to
find
options
out
there
take
the
money
you
would
have
spent
on
this
and
buy
a
hanssens
gueuze
o
the
first
two
thoughts
i
had
as
i
drank
this
was
this
is
a
great
starter
sour
for
nonbeer
friends
and
are
there
champagne
grapes
in
here
this
is
a
wellbalanced
sour
but
very
subtle
in
the
sourness
i
enjoyed
this
beer
but
more
of
a
sessionable
or
starter
sour
your
wine
friends
will
like
this
beer
and
your
beer
friends
will
most
likely
be
let
down
by
this
beer
d
this
was
a
nice
gueuze
with
bold
and
complex
scent
and
taste
the
body
was
fitting
and
the
finish
was
surprisingly
smooth
would
age
well
but
is
already
good
fresh
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
but
recommended
for
fans
of
the
style
im
not
very
excited
here
its
okay
but
there
are
so
many
good
options
which
sell
for
less
than
11
99
for
375ml
b
o
i
cant
see
a
lot
wrong
with
this
beer
it
has
balnce
and
sourness
that
is
the
equal
of
a
lot
of
established
lambics
the
finish
is
a
little
sticky
maybe
a
little
more
carbonation
is
needed
d
very
tart
and
acidic
nicely
balanced
and
good
kick
an
actually
approachable
gueuze
in
that
the
acidic
nature
isnt
quite
toothscrapingly
tart
as
the
fruitiness
is
weirdly
achieved
sans
guest
fruit
adjunct
the
wood
goes
far
here
at
least
in
the
subjugation
of
the
funk
making
for
an
overall
pleasant
walk
in
the
park
for
the
style
worthy
and
agreeably
drinkable
appearance
is
a
very
nice
looking
golden
tone
with
a
short
offwhite
head
atop
its
nose
contains
apples
black
pepper
wood
and
lemon
an
interesting
aroma
but
nothing
crazier
than
some
others
from
the
style
it
has
a
taste
of
grapes
sour
qualities
hay
and
funk
mouthfeel
is
light
a
very
dry
finish
which
leaves
you
craving
some
water
but
i
dig
it
this
is
a
well
done
gueuze
and
from
what
i
understand
the
first
true
gueuze
that
mikkeller
has
produced
it
is
well
done
and
for
those
who
i
have
a
chance
to
try
it
do
so
nice
hazy
light
orange
with
a
decent
head
that
lingers
wonderful
smell
definitely
know
its
a
geuze
thought
the
carbonation
would
have
been
a
little
better
based
on
the
pour
but
it
helps
out
the
smooth
initial
taste
and
mouthfeel
the
sour
comes
in
at
the
end
and
is
in
no
way
overwhelming
just
a
nice
finish
not
a
bad
first
effort
for
a
geuze
as
it
is
in
no
way
an
easy
style
to
pull
off
hope
the
framboos
is
just
as
good
o
a
good
gueze
although
i
wish
it
was
a
bit
more
sour
and
the
oak
notes
werent
so
up
front
could
have
been
a
little
bit
more
well
balanced
but
then
i
hold
mikkeller
to
a
higher
standard
then
most
i
suppose
the
pour
is
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
white
head
moderately
funky
with
lots
of
dirt
mushroom
must
and
grass
a
light
pepper
aroma
in
the
background
lemon
and
lemon
zest
provide
a
light
tartness
the
flavor
is
a
bit
more
oak
forward
though
still
rather
funky
mildly
tart
some
grass
and
moderate
funk
has
a
bit
of
a
young
homebrew
sour
flavor
overall
decent
beer
but
the
light
bitterness
isnt
really
doing
it
any
favours
overall
a
good
take
on
a
geuze
and
would
drink
again

good

of

green

notes
with

also
discernable
taste
is
a
semicomplex
mix
of
green
apple
notes
some
light
funky
notes
and
subtle
barnyard
flavours
body
is
about
average
with
great
carbonation
well
brewed
and
nicely
drinkable
and
somewhat
similar
to
girardin
with
maybe
a
bit
more
acidity
and
less
barnyard
notes
fresh
and
spontaneous
but
nothing
amazing
i
look
forward
to
trying
the
fruitedged
versions
of
this
actually
very
well
done
for
a
first
lambic
beer
the
balance
of
tartness
with
a
touch
of
fruitiness
and
some
funk
is
very
good
and
makes
for
an
enjoyable
beer
this
isnt
as
full
on
as
cantillon
or
as
complex
as
drie
fonteinen
first
of
all
this
is
totally
new
for
i
mean
mikkeller
doing
a
gueuze
and
i
heard
its
his
first
attempt
and
brewed
at
cantillion
and
it
pours
a
murky
golden
orange
hue
with
nice
carbonation
that
leaves
behind
a
creamy
two
finger
head
that
stays
and
leaves
a
rim
of

first
smell
i
get
which
is
quite

followed
by

and
finished
with

and
overall
for

its
bloody
good
and
thats
exactly
why
i
love
this
brewer
he
just
pushes
boundaries
and
usually
comes
up

my
hat
goes

him

anyone
my
bottle
from
quebec
buying
club
i
dont
really
know
the
story
behind
this
beer
or
how
it
was
made
this
really
struck
me
as
having
a
cider
flavor
and
aroma
that
stood
out
i
just
found
similarities
in
the
funkiness
and
slight
apple
flavor
overall
the
beer
either
seemed
too
young
or
was
made
to
be
too
subtle
in
flavor
a
very
fresh
and
accessible
gueuze
tasted
at
a
beer
sampling
at
de
klomp
linköping
sweden
thanks
bill
for
the
chance
to
try
this
one
i
believe
this
was
mikkellers
firt
attempt
at
a
true
gueze
pours
a
medium
tan
with
a
beige
head
nose
has
tart
fruits
oak
and
some
funk
taste
is
a
bit
mellow
for
the
style
not
alot
or
sourness
going
on
here
body
is
crisp
and
refreshing
not
bad
edit
note
i
have
had
this
one
since
from
the
bottle
and
although
i
did
not
take
notes
i
think
it
was
superior
from
the
bottle
probably
an
a
or
a
will
review
again
if
i
get
the
chance
not
the
best
gueuze
i
have
ever
tried
but
a
very
solid
example
from
mikkeller
overall
i
thought
this
was
an
interesting
beer
but
was
not
quite
as
polished
as
the
best
beers
of
this
style
still
its
worth
a
shot
if
you
are
a
sour
fan
or
know
a
lot
abouts
you
will
be
disappointed
so
just
skip
it
when
the
bottle
was
opened
there
was
a
brief
hiss
and
the
air
filled
with
an
intense
skunk
unfortunate
although
the
green
bottle
sure
didnt
help
any
after
1015
minutes
this
dissipated
and
there
was
a
more
familiar
farmhouse
funk
and
wild
yeast
aroma
akin
to
cantillon
honestly
wouldnt
be
surprised
if
they
cultured
and
pitched
dregs
from
cantillon
bottles
in
this
light
aromas
of
cheese
rind
damp
wood
and
soft
lemon
pith
its
pretty
spot
on
in
similarity
to
lambic
and
theres
little
to
no
sauternes
character
to
it
which
was
sort
of
a
letdown
clarity
was
fairly
bright
carbonation
was
rapid
and
there
was
a
thin
layer
of
crackling
foam
on
the
surface
depositing
bits
of
lace
here
and
there
taste
was
bright
and
relatively
sour
puckering
lemony
citrus
and
light
dry
oakiness
round
it
out
nicely
overall
it
is
worth
a
try
though
miscategorized
as
a
gueuze
overall
really
nice
surprise
overall
very
tart
sour
ale
with
a
big
lactic
bite
and
a
nice
wine
barrel
presence
these
barrels
were
definitely
wet
when
filled
with
gueuze
given
the
price
of
the
bottle
its
in
with
some
stiff
competition
with
beers
of
similar
styles
worth
a
shot
though
if
you
split
the

with
a
friend
12
7
ounce

dated

on

served
in
a
tulip
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
gold
color
with
an
inch
and
a
half
offwhite
head
the
head
lasts
a
little
while
but
there
isnt
much
of
any
lacing
at
all
the
brew
smells
like
white

oak

some

mouthfeelbody
is

with

i
like
this
beer
overall
but
its
not
one
of
my
favorite
gueuzes
15
99
a
bottle
overall
good
though
the
sauternes
barrel
is
pretty
mild
overall
and
the
beer
itself
is
as
well
for
a
gueuze
anyway
hints
at
being
great
but
doesnt
get
there
with
more
time
in
the
barrel
it
could
be
really
something
in
this
regard
the
bruery
sour
range
is
kicking
goals
o
this
is
beer
that
has
an
acquired
taste
and
might
take
some
people
to
get
used
to
but
delivers
lots
of
funk
both
in
the
smell
and
taste
p
killer
with
spiced
seafood
think
blackened
white
fish
garlicy
muscles
etc
overall
a
good
beer
but
there
is
no
doubt
the
sauternes
barrels
take
this
beer
over
not
as
much
of
the
tartness
i
hoped
for
highly
recommend
for
a
wine
fan
looking
for
a
beer
to
their
liking
pours
a
fairly
pale
yelloworange
color
its
somewhat
cloudy
though
i
imagine
careful
bottle
handling
and
pouring
could
render
a
clear
glass
medium
white
head
pretty
good
bubblage
for
a
sour
it
smells
like
a
gueuze
maybe
somewhat
young
or
at
least
from
young
barrels
but
this
is
as
close
to
lambic
country
as
any
nonlambic
that
ive
tried
its
delicate
and
complex
with
layers
of
funk
and
gentle
acidity
it
has
the
lambic
mineral
character
sulfur
and
iron
mushrooms
wet
hay
grass
mild
vinous
vinegar
if
you
gave
me
this
glass
blind
id
probably
guess
drie
fonteinen
or
girardin
based
on
the
aroma
knowing
what
it
is
im
getting
a
bit
more
oak
than
id
expect
from
a
lambic
but
that
could
be
bias
creeping
in
lots
of
fruit
apricots
berries
peaches
lemons
limes
persimmons
i
could
smell
this
beer
all
day
which
sounds
kinda
weird
admittedly
the
taste
starts
with
gentle
fruity
sweetness
and
very
mild
grain
acidity
creeps
up
slowly
and
the
beer
dries
out
completely
by
the
finish
more
lactic
than
acetic
but
its
a
lambicy
mix
the
finish
has
a
lot
of
oak
nice
tannic
hit
aftertaste
lots
of
lemons
funk
grass
earth
some
wine
sweetness
which
takes
away
a
touch
from
its
lambicness
but
again
im
left
wondering
if
id
notice
it
blind
its
light
on
the
palate
with
a
medium
pucker
that
sorta
sneaks
up
on
you
the
tannic
oakiness
is
a
bit
bracing
this
is
simply
delicious
i
wish
that
american
breweries
would
take
note
and
start
pushing
domestic
sours
in
this
direction
i
imagine
getting
lambic
flavors
right
is
rather
hard
but
its
worth
the
effort
we
need
more
lower
abv
lambicstyle
sours
o
sour
sweet
spicy
vinous
nice
and
enjoyable
d
i
really
really
liked
this
mikkeller
gueze
i
dont
drink
them
too
often
but
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
to
the
sour
lovers
out
there
d
this
is
quite
good
and
i
much
prefer
the
blend
of
lambics
here
than
those
used
in
the
initial
iteration
of
the
spontan
series
i
always
found
those
overly
mineral
and
found
the
higher
abv
puzzling
750
ml
bottle
there
isnt
any

information
on
the
bottle
but
i
know
ive
had
the
bottle
for
at
least
a
year
probably
closer
to
2
served
in
a
prairie
teku
glass
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
ambercopper
color
with
about
an
inch
offwhite
head
that
stuck
around
a
while
theres
also
a
lot
of
lacing
aroma
is
musty
and
tart
the
brew
smells
like
hay
wood
apples
vinegar
and
earthy
mustiness
i
think
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
but
theres
also
the
addition
of
some
bready
malt
stone
fruit
and
pears
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
a
bit
slick
with
high
but
soft
carbonation
its
easy
enough
to
drink
i
liked
this
gueuze
and
id
certainly
like
to
try
this
again
in
the
future
a
big
bottle
with
a
big
bottle
cap
it
pours
a
mostly
clear
copper
with
an
extremely
frothy
head
this
is
one
of
the
most
aromatic
beers
ive
ever
poured
i
can
smell
it
clearly
just
from
the
pour
long
before
i
dunk
my
nose
in
the
glass
it
smells
of
oranges
horse
blankets
grass
sugar
and
wood
this
smells
fantastic
i
have
to
say
the
taste
follows
suit
and
is
just
wonderfully
balanced
it
isnt
too
sweet
or
too
sour
with
just
enough
funk
to
make
you
want
to
put
on
some
disco
and
get
down
there
is
also
a
subtle
smokiness
to
the
beer
that
is
a
nice
balance
its
very
restrained
which
is
good
for
me
im
not
a
fan
of
the
smoke
but
it
adds
a
nice
element
to
the
overall
flavor
really
fantastic
gueuze
id
have
to
say
id
use
this
as
a
style
example
to
my
friends
eager
to
learn
about
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
tingly
with
a
slickness
that
holds
it
together
wow
this
may
be
my
favorite
gueuze
these
guys
just
really
knocked
it
out
of
the
park
if
youre
into
very
strong
flavored
very
sour
beers
youll
probably
find
this
a
bit
bland
but
i
think
it
perfectly
hits
the
sweet
spot
between
interesting
and
drinkable
thumbs
way
up
on
this
one
o
overall
a
solid
gueuze
like
the
interplay
of
oak
and
fruit
here
overall
quite
good
the
smoked
element
was
a
nice
touch
pretty
good
very
different
i
am
not
into
smoked
beers
but
this
worked
quite
well
medium
bodied
with
a
good
balance
of
earthy
funk
sweet
malt
subtle
smoke
and
acetic
vinegar
tart
and
puckering
up
front
with
nice
funk
and
sweet
acetic
acid
that
lingers
over
the
malt
notes
into
a
dry
slightly
smokey
finish
hints
of
caramel
and
toffee
with
rauch
characteristics
creeping
in
on
the
back
end
very
unique
and
complex
a
bit
tough
to
drink
but
pretty
tasty
served
from
tap
into
a
trappe
door
tulip
poured
a
slightly
hazy
redorange
with
a
one
finger
slightly
offwhite
head
that
subsided
to
half
a
finger
slow
maintained
nice
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
tart
cherry
wood
sour
subtle
tart
and
smoke
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
funk
tart
sour
wood
tart
cherry
and
smoke
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
mediumhigh
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
fairly
good
brew
the
smoky
aspect
on
this
one
really
adds
a
unique
touch
to
this
style
as
it
simply
adds
another
layer
of
complexity
to
an
already
complex
style
the
flavor
is
very
refreshing
and
keeps
you
going
to
see
what
each
sip
holds
next
the
mouthfeel
on
this
one
was
a
little
off
for
what
i
enjoy
in
this
style
as
i
would
have
loved
the
carbonation
to
be
a
little
higher
still
a
really
well
done
brew
that
i
could
drink
numerous
of
these
i
suggest
you
do
the
same
but
save
a
little
bit
for
the
others
in
your
area
gushed
like
a
fountain
upon
popping
cap
making
for
a
minor
mess
a
super
frothy
head
that
took
up
of
the
glass
tops
the
pour
that
is
a
very
hazy
yelloworange
smells
of
belgian
yeast
some
spices
and
just
a
tad
of
tartness
first
sip
is
more
sour
than
the
nose
indicated
there
is
a
very
nice
funkyness
with
the
tartness
all
due
to
the
wild
yeast
there
is
some
bready
flavor
and
citrus
notes
too
but
make
no
mistake
it
is
the
sourness
that
stands
out
that
sourness
hits
in
the
front
middle
and
back
of
the
mouth
not
as
sour
as
most
but
still
a
pretty
damn
good
effort
not
bad
at
all
really
pleasant
and
very
consumer
friendly
big
herbgreen
pepper
and
almost
saison
finish
one
to
try
if
you
can
find
despite
the
overcarbonation
this
is
a
decently
drinkable
gueze
thanks
to
jedwards
for
sharing
this
at
our
tasting
pours

dull

with
a
loose
halfinch
cap
that
quickly
disperses
into
a
band
and
some
thin
dollops
of
foam
nose
reveals
light
tropical
fruit
citric
acid
and
a
sweet
quality
the
taste
is
completely
counter
to
the
nose
starts
off
smokey
like
a
rauchbier
and
finishes
with
some
citrus
sourness
consistency
in
the
mouth
is
lightmedium
with
a
very
harsh
and
prickly
carbonation
that
leaves
a
residual
burn
across
the
back
of
the
tongue
didnt
really
care
for
this
one
weird
and
lacks
and
identity
notes
im
glad
i
tried
this
one
really
enjoyed
its
complexity
and
unique
blend
of
flavors
a
great
experience
for
all
the
senses
i
like
the
beer
but
the
wild
yeast
carbonation
problem
needs
to
be
solved
ive
rounded
each
of
the
last
three
criteria
up
by
5
because
everything
improves
after
letting
the
beer
to
breathe
or
bleed
for
510
minutes
the
beer
pours
a
murky
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
lots
of
citrus
fruit
with
some
tartness
the
flavor
is
tart
citrus
with
some
cheese
notes
somewhat
odd
and
not
all
that
appealing
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
d
a
couple
of
my
other
buddies
that
tasted
this
beer
didnt
like
it
but
i
found
it
appealing
to
my
palate
overall
a
very
odd
beer
that
i
quite
enjoyed
at
5
50bottle
this
is
a
solid
interesting
beer
that
is
absolutely
worth
your
purchase
quite
the
gusher
initial
pour
leads
to
a
34
glass
of
head
takes
some
time
to
get
to
a
drinkable
glass
antici
say
it
pation
nice
sweetness
tempered
by
the
funkiness
of
a
geuze
but
tempered
is
the
word
reminds
me
of
a
sweeter
funkier
slightly
less
hoppy
orval
not
much
in
the
aroma
department
but
delivers
in
taste
and
mouthfeel
i
would
prefer
a
larger
serving
of
this
winner
winner
chicken
dinner
will
buy
again
drinkability
low
i
dont
think
i
would
every
purchase
or
recommend
this
to
anyone
the
body
was
good
light
and
crisp
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
drinkability
will
vary
depending
on
your
tolerance
for
the
sourness
i
liked
this
beer
a
lot
but
probably
wouldnt
drink
more
than
1
in
a
row
if
you
like
the
style
you
should
try
this
beer
so
i
realize
what
the
warnings
were
about
this
beer
smelling
pretty
farmhouse
like
as
it
warms
and
i
mean
room
temp
warm
it
starts
to
smell
pretty
foul
almost
like
vomit
it
still
tastes
good
but
the
aroma
is
pretty
repulsive
haha
now
i
know
why
the
bottle
says
to
serve
chilled
and
its
in
the
form
of
a
disclaimer
i
could
imagine
having
a
few
of
these
but
motstly
see
it
as
either
a
hot
weather
refresher
or
possibly
and
apertif
or
digestif
with
a
meal
can
feel
its
7
this
beer
is
definitely
drinkable
and
with
its
dryness
and
7
abv
could
be
a
good
starter
for
someone
interested
in
seeing
what
a
gueze
is
all
about
probably
wont
finish
the
bottle
o
very
nice
this
is
tasting
great
on
this
90
degree
day
afternoon
thirst
quenching
a
balanced
beer
with
a
nice
sour
tart
funk
goodness
up
front
some
nice
fruity
flavors
in
the
middle
and
finishes
really
good
with
a
slight
oak
flavor
and
nice
dry
finish
good
beer
but
at
20
a
bottle
i
might
need
to
reserve
this
beer
for
special
occasion
o
this
has
all
the
same
characteristics
of
a
traditional
belgian
geuze
a
very
good
sour
i
certainly
recommend
this
beer
to
sour
fans
beautiful
execution
color
is
golden
with
a
hint
of
brown
assuming
oak
smells
of
lemon
and
grape
fruit
with
a
hint
of
oak
tagain
citrus
at
the
start
following
with
oak
and
ending
in
tart
goodness
light
body
and
carbonation
is
just
right
makes
it
very
fresh
this
was
a
nice
surprise
mouthfeel
it
tastes
a
lot
fuller
than
it
looks
it
almost
looks
a
little
watery
after
sitting
in
my
glass
a
while
but
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
imo
definitely
could
drink
a
few
of
these
on
a
hot
day
overall
this
is
a
very
good
sour
beer
i
would
def
buy
this
again
but
not
regularly
i
am
not
sure
how
much
everyone
else
paid
but
i
paid
20
for
1
bottle
its
a
bit
steep
in
price
but
very
good
a
once
a
year
purchase
when
you
can
find
it
mouthfeel
is
very
dry
somewhat
gritty
overall
pretty
good
i
will
admit
im
definitely
a
sour
beer
drinker
and
i
picked
this
one
up
on
a
whim
however
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
i
have
had
other
sours
with
this
baking
soda
like
flavor
which
im
not
a
fan
of
but
the
other
flavors
of
this
beer
are
actually
pretty
good
i
pair
this
with
chicken
picatta
it
gets
an
85
from
me
which
is
great
for
a
sour
a
lot
of
grass
hay
on
the
nose
along
with
the
expected
stinging
citric
and
a
very
distant
tart
vinegar
taste
is
strong
on
the
dry
citrus
doesnt
pop
upfront
with
the
tart
sourness
it
is
present
but
not
overwhelming
mostly
lemon
tart
finishes
with
some
latent
acidity
similar
to
duchess
but
not
as
lingering

overall
a
pretty
good
beer
and
worth
having
at
least
once
the
beer
is
a
bit
tarty
and
may
not
be
for
everyone
but
this
is
definitely
a
must
have
for
tart
fans
ive
never
had
a
gueuze
before
the
style
seems
to
be
pretty
good
and
im
glad
the
bruery
is
taking
chances
with
old
and
rare
styles
such
as
this
flavor
is
very
citric
and
lactic
pretty
tart
this
is
one
of
my
top
five
sours
cloudy
orangeyellow
thin
bubbly
head
aroma
of
acidic
lemon
sourdough
dirty
funk
taste
followed
the
nose
pretty
much
lemon
grapefruit
rind
yogurt
malt
vinegar
oak
sprite
moderately
sour
but
more
in
an
acetic
way
i
dont
know
just
kind
of
messy
and
unbalanced
loved
this
nice
and
tart
first
time
trying
this
style
of
beer
and
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
cant
wait
to
try
more
another
amazing
sour
from
bruery
even
though
gueuze
is
listed
in
the
description
its
not
very
salty
great
tartness
carbonation
and
mouthfeel
oprobably
the
best
american
made
gueuze
that
ive
had
definitely
worth
a
try
d
great
beer
i
like
it
bracingly
tart
offering
from
the
bruery
rueuze
provides
a
blend
of
barnyard
hay
and
lemon
on
the
nose
with
pleasantly
sharp
acidity
as
the
brew
hits
the
tongue
carbonation
is
light
and
what
bubbles
there
are
tiny
and
vinous
no
head
what
so
all
long
finish
that
brings
out
more
of
the
rustic
side
and
the
oak
of
this
blended
sour
ale
would
pair
nicely
with
offensively
pungent
washed
rind
cheeses
like
epoisses
or
ardrahan
pour
at
a
tasting
light
straw
body

this

o
if
you
like
the
sourness
of
this
beer
style
this
beer
is
one
of
the
best
not
overpowering
in
sourness
the
slight
sweetness
in
the
flavour
makes
the
difference
o
this
is
a
decent
gueuze
its
nothing
to
write
songs
about
but
it
does
the
job
quite
well
o
an
ok
gueuze
but
for
me
it
has
two
main
faults
way
too
sweet
and
way
too
one
dimensional
would
get
the
cuvée
instead
of
this
every
time
o
enjoyed
it
more
that
any
other
lambic
ive
had
to
date
this
is
a
tasty
and
extremely
light
beer
while
i
dont
like
it
as
much
as
the
fruit
lambics
specifically
the
kriek
it
gives
you
a
great
easygoing
brett
experience
id
definitely
drink
it
again
although
id
prefer
to
lean
toward
the
fruit
lambics
overall
a
pretty
good
find
here
doesnt
have
the
strong
sour
characters
of
some
of
the
belgians
that
ive
had
but
then
again
thats
ok
a
subdued
and
refreshing
find
nothing
but
good
things
to
say
md
loose
on
the
carbonation
on
the
verge
of
being
flat
medium
bodied
but
really
it
feels
like
the
added
candy
sugar
dominates
the
balance
this
is
not
a
good
example
of
blended
lambic
in
my
honest
opinion
having
tried
myself
a
dozen
or
so
much
better
oude
geuze
where
no
added
sugar
is
applied
in
this
case
it
feels
like
the
sugary
elements
have
split
the
beer
down
the
middle
clearcut
sweetness
visàvis
weak
funky
fruitiness
personally
i
would
never
want
to
revisit
this
beer
unless
the
brewery
reverted
to
the
oude
geuze
style
by
abandoning
the
overpowering
candy
sugar
which
really
has
killed
off
many
more
pleasant
flavours
one
would
expect
from
a
glass
of
classic
tart
funky
malt
juice
what
i
liked
less
was
the
appearance
it
is
not
that
special
a
minimal
white
head
overall
i
really
have
no
idea
what
lindemans
is
trying
to
do
with
this
beer
but
it
is
the
sorriest
excuse
for
a
lambic
that
i
have
ever
encountered
i
will
certainly
never
ever
buy
it
again
its
not
bad
but
not
amazing
it
seems
to
be
a
good
entry
to
the
style
but
not
anywhere
near
the
grand
daddy
of
cantillon
o
good
drinkability
a
very
easy
gueuze
much
more
sweet
and
less
tarty
than
the
classic
gueuzes
but
still
a
pleasant
belgian
beer
beer
is
medium
to
mediumlight
bodied
with
minimal
to
no
wateriness
around
the
edges
carbonation
is
moderate
so
this
foams
slightly
on
the
palate
leading
to
a
fairly
smooth
mouthfeel
closes
out
dry
slightly
astringent
and
with
only
the
slightest
hit
of
sweetness
around
the
edges
of
the
mouth
the
beer
is
amberorange
in
color
with
a
short
lived
white
head
not
a
very
good
nose
to
this
quite
a
bit
of
grass
and
maybe
even
some
butter
theres
some
light
lemon
notes
in
the
background
the
flavor
is
a
bit
better
its
got
a
decent
tartness
to
it
but
its
somewhat
vinegary
a
little
apple
and
grass
in
there
too
medium
bodied
with
somewhat
low
carbonation
this
one
really
was
a
let
down
cuvee
rene
is
much
better
o
okay
beer
but
nothing
special
here
off
taste
for
the
style
and
just
plain
not
too
much
going
on
i
would
not
seek
this
out
again
as
there
are
plenty
of
other
gueuzes
that
i
enjoy
more
o
something
in
the
middle
between
a
gueuze
and
a
flanders
red
ale
age
has
probably
a
role
in
this
very
drinkable
and
quite
refreshing
but
not
as
complex
as
other
spontaneous
fermentation
beers
i
have
tried
an
easily
accessible
geuze
a
beginners
choice
but
not
bad
as
a
refreshment
this
25
cl
bottle
revealed
a
dark
amber
colored
brew
with
a
wispy
head
of
foam
the
aroma
is
a
mixture
of
fruity
sourness
and
some
sugary
notes
the
flavor
is
sour
and
tart
although
tartness
more
than
sourness
defines
the
profile
the
fruitiness
borders
on
sugary
and
is
a
deficit
in
this
brew
it
is
not
as
cracklingly
crisp
as
some
other
gueuze
i
have
had
but
it
still
snaps
on
the
way
a
little
like
champagne
overall
a
very
pleasant
drop
sourness
keeps
your
palate
honest
but
does
not
overpower
down
a
bit
on
drinkability
due
to
hign
tap
price
taphouse
even
though
i
love
bitter
brews
the
old
pilsner
urquell
or
jever
paired
with
sourness
is
too
much
for
my
taste
glad
to
try
this
beer
although
i
didnt
find
it
to
be
quite
a
traditional
tasting
gueuze
more
of
a
hybrid
between
a
flanders
ale
a
gueuze
and
a
sweet
belgian
amber
ale
beer
is
thin
and
dry
with
a
mild
sweetness
mostly
there
is
a
lactic
acid
sourness
but
even
that
is
a
little
weak
it
tastes
a
little
cidery
but
its
not
as
sweet
as
i
feared
it
would
be
overall
probably
not
a
repeat
there
are
much
much
much
better
gueuzes
out
there
but
it
wasnt
a
regret
good
gueuze
offering
but
if
your
after
a
style
defining
example
perhaps
look
elsewhere
drinkability
after
a
few
sips
the
sweetness
really
starts
to
get
to
me
in
and
of
itself
the
beer
is
not
bad
it
is
just
the
accumulated
effect
of
the
sweetness
that
causes
the
problem
d
one
of
the
lighter
gueuzes
youll
find
and
worth
a
try
as
an
intro
to
lambics
overall
unique
and
pleasant
maybe
a
bit
expensive
and
hard
to
get
for
me
because
i
had
to
drive
all
the
way
over
to
france
to
get
myself
a
good
selection
of
belgian
beers
but
well
worth
it
d
well
i
found
this
geueze
to
be
a
little
too
sweet
in
comparison
to
others
it
is
a
well
crafted
beer
but
falls
short
of
excellence
hazy
deep
gold
body
minimal
visible
carbonation
almost
nonexistent
head
just
a
thin
ring
around
edge
of
glass
nose
is
pretty
fruity
a
bit
of
peach
and
some
meyer
lemon
little
if
any
hop
odors
the
taste
is
sour
not
much
else
going
on
other
than
some
oak
character
lacking
in
any
sweetness
quite
a
bit
of
saltiness
in
the
finish
pretty
good
effervescent
mouthfeel
even
as
i
develop
my
palate
for
lambics
not
sure
i
could
finish
an
entire
bottle
of
this
though
certainly
worth
a
try
for
sourlambic
fans
tastes
very
nice
heavy
tartness
and
some
serious
lack
of
sugar
which
makes
this
beer
pretty
cool
nothing
that
is
like
a
normal
belgian
but
more
than
that
a
decent
balance
between
sweet
and
sour
and
my
tooth
enamel
stays
fully
intact
md
light
and
crisp
very
lively
carbonation
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
liking
but
still
a
passable
beer
this
was
my
first
lambic
and
i
liked
it
ill
have
to
chase
down
some
more
pours
orange
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
tart
citurs
and
not
as
much
funk
as
i
was
expecting
the
flavor
is
tartness
with
a
good
bit
of
sweetness
to
balance
things
out
good
citrus
notes
and
not
much
funk
not
a
very
sour
gueuze
thin
mouthfeel
and
high
carbonation
not
bad
but
not
as
good
as
cuvee
rene
a
totally
unbeer
like
beer
really
sweet
and
sour
with
no
distinguishable
malt
or
yeast
characteristics
now
only
if
this
could
replace
soft
drinks
and
fruit
juices
in
my
life
id
be
set
really
a
refreshing
and
enjoyable
beer
and
at
4
you
could
have
it
and
not

too
bad
overall
slight
tartness
and
smooth

beer
d
quite

a
little
bit
dry
at
the
end
my
wife
does
love
it
overall
i
found
this
to
be
a
pretty
good
and
easy
drinking
ale
it
may
not
be
my
first
choice
but
i
would
reach
for
it
again
pours
a
murky
golden
color
with
plenty
of
yeast
flakes
floating
about
tight
off
white
head
that
settles
into
a
solid
ring
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
fruity
with
a
lemon
tartness
the
taste
is
of
sugary
white
grape
juice
granny
smith
apples
light
honey
and
some
subtle
spices
the
feel
is
light
to
moderate
tingly
carbonation
and
sweet
overall
not
as
sweet
and
fruity
as
their
fruit
lambics
but
still
rather
sweet
the
nice
feel
makes
this
quite
drinkable
flavor
was
slightly
tart
and
a
fellow
taster
compared
it
to
apple
strudel
for
diabetics
theres
some
sweetness
there
but
it
in
an
artifical
nutrasweet
kinda
way
aroma
is
of
green
apples
and
light
notes
of
ginger
spice
the
sourness
is
moderate
and
would
seemingly
pair
well
with
a
hot
summer
day
but
in
absence
of
this
setting
i
would
put
my
money
down
on
something
else
a
very
gentle
gueuze
good
for
those
who
are
new
to
the
style
agree
with
those
who
say
it
is
more
of
a
faro
overall
not
very
good
geuze
but
one
of
lindemans
better
beers
could
be
suitable
for
those
trying
geuze
for
the
first
time
as
it
is
very
mild
poored
into
a
standard
pint
glass
with
a
huge
flat
head
down
to
nothing
but
a
cap
within
no
time
wonderfull

smells
of

green
apples
maybe
just
a
little
grain
taste
once
again
green
apples
slightly
sour
but
not
bad
not
quite
like
a
cider
but
almost
feel
about
what
is
to
be
expected
given
the
flavors
and
smell
would
drink
it
again
it
is
easy
drinking
i
think
this
would
be
great
to
introduce
someone
to
the
style
since
its
nice
yet
not
too
extreme
pours
a
deep

initially
syrupy

apples
maple

suggestions
of

tied
together
with
classic
gueze
acidity
rather
tame
on
the
funky
notes
and
unfortunately
sweet
covering
up
the
tang
lindemans
seems
to
produce
these
exotic
treats
for
the
masses
taming
the
wild
characteristics
these
ales
shouldnt
be
so
user
friendly
pours
a
golden

some

this

stands
on

and
may
very
well
be
a

overall
this
beer
is
very
dry
and
has
a
bit
of
a
sour
note
the
mouthfeel
is
astringent
and
the
finish
ithe
finish
is
very
sour
bitter
and
very
very
dry
the
drinkability
is
low
here
because
i
cant
take
so
much
of
the
sweet
disappointing
lively
mouthfeel
though
keeping
in
mind
the
fact
that
my
knowledge
of
the
gueuze
style
could
fit
on
the
head
of
a
pin
with
room
to
spare
im
pretty
sure
that
lindemans
gueuze
lambic
is
well
outside
the
realm
of
acceptable
given
the
addition
of
so
much
sugar
that
in
combination
with
the
fact
that
its
a
pretty
decent
little
sipper
makes
it
incredibly
hard
to
score
my
first
gueuze
i
dont
know
what
to
make
of
it
this
is
something
i
enjoy
but
dont
know
how
to
rate
quite
yet
i
have
some
lindemans
gueuze
cuvée
rené
that
i
am
going
to
try
next
so
i
can
compare
a
complex
style
and
i
want
to
revisit
this
beer
d
i
am
a
little
bit
let
down
with
this
one
i
wanted
a
sour
beer
and
this
one
is
not
it
too
sweet
but
smells
nice
and
very
complex
375ml
bottle
nice
redorange
color
it
doesnt
smell
as
funky
as
the
cuvee
rene
but
still
has
a
vinegarlike
and
a
hint
of
a
musty
basement
oldness
applecider
vinegar
flavor
but
also
sweet
and
syrupy
oddly
this
still
isnt
really
sour
and
the
syruplike
aspect
is
a
detractor
the
cuvee
rene
is
much
much
better
d
like
most
beers
in
this
style
this
isnt
someything
id
drink
on
a
regular
basis
but
this
would
be
a
good
introduction
to
the
style
its
got
the
characteristics
that
youd
expect
but
not
too
overpowering
like
some
others
easily
my
favorite
offering
from
these
guys
id
like
to
try
some
more
like
this
that
are
rated
higher
than
this
one
in
the
end
i
cant
get
past
the
candied
apple
character
it
drowns
out
everything
else
and
is
overly
sweet
this
doesnt
taste
horrible
it
doesnt
have
serious
flavor
flaws
it
just
is
overly
simplistic
in
its
sweetness
and
not
very
good
this
just
isnt
my
cup
of
tea
my
only
previous
experience
with
lindemans
is
the
fruit
flavored
lambis
they
brew
so
this
one
is
a
bit
different
it
pours
a
clear
light
copper
with
a
thin
but
lingering
head
the
aroma
is
fruity
maybe
slightly
cidery
and
sweet
the
flavor
is
sweet
upfront
with
a
kind
of
fruity
quality
the
fruitiness
leads
into
nice
tart
and
slightly
sour
flavors
there
is
a
nice
earthy
funky
flavor
which
combined
with
the
tartness
lingers
in
my
mouth
i
am
not
too
familiar
with
the
style
but
it
is
certainly
an
interesting
beer
and
not
bad
overall
from
a
12
oz
bottle
dark
golden
apple
juice
appearance
head
lasted
briefly
but
the
beautiful
carbonation
keeps
rising
woody
sweet
smell
very
light
apple
taste
with
a
little
tart
aftertaste
nice
feel
and
very
easy
to
drink
not
something
for
me
to
buy
repeatedly
but
nice
to
drink
nonetheless
d
a
solid
example
by
style
nothing
fancy
just
a
well
brewed
beer
that
was
refreshing
leaving
you
wanting
more
rather
sweet
and
onedimensional
for
a
standard
gueuze
actually
pretty
drinkable
aside
from
the
cork
taint
but
as
with
many
lindemans
beers
this
is
rather
onedimensional
and
sweet
for
its
style
i
am
reviewing
a
bottle
of
the
lindemans
gueuze
foudroyante
the
beer
poured
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
medium
thickness
head
that
runs
away
quickly
and
gives
way
to
a
little
ring
on
the
edge
slight
tart
aroma
a
bit
funky
but
not
too
much
the
taste
is
somewhat
tart
but
a
bit
sweet
as
well
sweeter
that
you
usually
get
in
a
gueuze
but
drinkable
and
approachable
for
those
not
used
to
the
style
d
not
a
favorite
my
girlfriend
liked
it
but
maybe
because
she
loves
riesling
wine
pours
a
virtually
clear
golden
brown
with
a
light
tan
head
nose
is
an
expected
musty
yeast
with
a
sweet
tone
blanketing
it
flavor
is
sweeter
than
i
expected
with
slight
apple
qualities
as
well
the
sweet
barely
leans
towards
a
tart
edge
barely
feel
is
decent
nice
carbonation
drinkable
sure
i
wont
be
pouring
it
down
the
drain
but
for
gueuze
ill
be
going
elsewhere
in
the
future
even
with
my
limited
experience
on
the
style
i
can
tell
that
this
one
is
not
as
mature
or
full
in
character
as
others
are
and
can
be
the
experience
makes
me
wish
i
was
drinking
cuvee
rene
as
this
was
dull
and
underwhelming
like
plain
yogurt
this
regular
lindemans
gueuze
is
not
so
easy
to
find
in
chicago
but
not
really
worth
drinking
again
at
612
oz
bottle
give
me
the
cantillon
i
crave
for
a
dollar
more
drinkability
une
version
de
gueuze
correcte
mais
sans
plus
i
have
a
feeling
this
has
been
produced
for
the
mass
market
and
is
a
not
a
gueuze
in
the
true
sence
of
the
style
drinkable
without
a
doubt
but
a
long
way
from
the
sour
bitter
old
style
gueuze
i
like
to
think
i
can
remember
pours
a
relatively
clear
dark
golden
with
just
a
slight
head
and
no
lacing
to
speak
of
the
nose
is
slightly
sour
with
notes
of
grape
must
lemon
and
tangerine
a
slight
hit
of
sweetness
on
the
end
really
quite
sweet
much
more
so
than
the
nose
would
suggest
approaching
faro
territory
sweet
sour
interplay
rather
simple
with
candi
sugar
lemon
and
tangerine
just
the
barest
hit
of
funkiness
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
slightly
slick
just
okay
too
sweet
for
the
style
and
lacks
complexity
drinkability
would
be
higher
if
it
werent
quite
so
sweet
this
bottle
went
down
quickly
but
for
the
price
i
want
something
with
this
level
of
sophistication
in
the
palate
but
without
such
a
glaring
weakness
that
said
id
love
to
have
this
around
more
often
overall
i
was
sort
of
dissapointed
in
this
because
i
was
hoping
that
it
was
not
sweetened
its
not
really
my
cup
of
tea
or
beer
d
this
is
scary
i
could
live
on
this
stuff
i
think
that
it
would
go
well
with
anything
from
salads
chicken
steak
chocolate
this
is
one
of
the
better
food
beers
out
there
i
could
down
bottle
after
bottle
of
this
stuff
but
id
be
broke
at
these
prices
i
paid
4
99
for
a
355ml
bottle
if
only
i
were
a
rich
man
sadly
price
is
a
factor
and
the
cost
of
this
stuff
will
prevent
me
from
buying
it
very
often
but
i
wont
detract
from
the
score
just
because
im
po
actually
this
is
so
drinkable
that
i
wish
it
had
some
characteristic
that
made
me
want
to
drink
more
slowly
because
at
five
bucks
for
this
little
bottle
im
paying
a
dollar
a
minute
at
this
rate
overall
like
i
said
i
like
the
beer
too
bad
its
not
a
traditional
gueuze
if
you
want
gueuze
go
elsewhere
if
you
want
a
nice
sweet
treat
with
a
touch
of
funk
give
this
one
a
try
easydrinking
gueuze
and
an
excellent
intro
into
the
style
definitely
on
the
sweeter
side
of
the
style
that
said
it
goes
down
swimmingly
as
does
the
other
examples
of
the
style
ive
tried
hell
im
tempted
to
never
drink
a
white
wine
again
i
wish
more
examples
of
gueuze
were
widely
available
over
here
at
the
end
we
agreed
that
there
was
little
point
in
serving
wine
when
this
is
available
i
didnt
find
the
funky
flavors
that
i
was
expecting
from
a
lambic
so
i
am
curious
what
ill
think
once
trying
others
bottle

good
retention
and
some
good

aroma
of
oak
is
more
prominent
then
expected
with
some
light
tart
note
also
noticeable
the
barnyard
factor
is
lighter
then
in
the
cuvée
rené
and
is
sorely
miss
taste
is
sweeter
then
i
would
have
expected
from
a
gueuze
but
it
still
provides
a
good
deal
of
refreshment
body
is
above
average
with
low
filtration
and
good
carbonation
while
being
far
from
the
real
thing
this
gueuze
is
still
enjoyable
on
a
hot
summer
day
if
maybe
a
tad
too
sweet
dark
amber
colour
reminds
me
of
some
sherry
generous
oaked
wines
nice
shades
when
you
hold
it
to
the
light
good
head
with
a
silky
lace
aroma

pungent
and
sour
barnyard
ripe

something
in
it
reminds
of
a
blue
cheese
very
complex
some
fruits
on
it

is

along
with

the

smooth
yet
dry
and
it
has
a
sweet
lingering
finish
overall
a
quite
drinkable
but
mild
gueuze
one
packed
with
flavor
but
its
not
quite
tart
or
wild
enough
to
fully
stimulate
my
senses
into
a
tulip
glass
pours
a
bright
somewhat
murky
copper
amber
a
light
white
head
recedes
to
a
thin
sparse
film
delicate
lacing
in
streaks
the
aroma
is
tart
sweet
and
sour
but
a
bit
sparse
maybe
interesting
but
it
doesnt
come
out
much
the
taste
is
much
more
expressive
lots
of
tart
fruits
drying
from
the
start
for
the
mouth
some
obvious
belgian
yeastiness
lots
of
carbonation
all
adding
to
this
effect
of
lambicy
goodness
i
personally
havent
had
that
many
sour
belgians
but
im
definitely
exploring
it
now
and
am
finding
surprisingly
that
i
like
em
and
this
one
isnt
an
exception
a
pretty
good
beer
poured
out
of
a
12
oz
bottle
into
the
most
suitable
glass
i
could
find
a
hennepin
glass
appearance
is
good
not
great
but
good
i
like
the
rubytinted
honey
color
and
the
head
was
a
good
two
fingers
at
first
receding
to
a
nice
sheet
no
lacing
the
smell
is
decent
with
a
good
bit
of
wheat
some
candi
sugar
and
that
classic
wild
tartness
the
taste
is
not
quite
what
i
had
hoped
for
it
has
a
bit
of
the
real
lambic
bite
to
it
but
not
enough
for
my
taste
and
it
is
further
negated
by
an
overbearing
sweetness
of
apples
and
orange
juice
the
mouthfeel
is
very
carbonated
and
again
a
bit
overly
cloying
with
the
sweets
it
is
pretty
drinkable
aside
from
the
guess
what
sweet
overall
good
not
great
drinkability
my
first
gueuze
i
liked
it
and
will
search
out
others
not
bad
at
all
im
not
overly
familiar
with
the
style
but
this
was
pretty
good
i
havent
had
any
of
the
more
traditional
gueuzes
so
i
dont
know
how
this
one
stacks
up
the
flavor
reminded
me
a
lot
of
duchesse
de
bourgogne
id
recommend
it
to
fans
of
that
beer
and
as
a
decent
intro
to
sour
beers
mouthfeel
was
sparkling
and
mediumfull
bodied
drinkability
this
is
a
very
appealing
geuze
it
doesnt
smell
like
farts
like
others
ive
tried
id
try
this
on
tap
and
imagine
its
much
better
aged
even
drinkability
great
overall
balance
making
it
pretty
drinkable
feels
light
and
drinks
ok
while
i
enjoy
lindemans
flavoured
lambics
most
of
them
seem
little
more
to
me
than
flavoured
soda
for
adults
because
of
this
i
was
unsure
of
how
true
to
the
style
their
gueuze
would
be
i
was
delightfully
surprised
with
it
its
colour
was
a
bit
darker
than
i
was
expecting
pouring
and
orange
copper
with
a
very
slight
haze
to
it
the
head
was
slightly
offwhite
and
loosely
knit
it
faded
away
rather
quickly
leaving
behind
a
ring
of
lace
around
the
edges
and
an
abstract
patch
work
of
frost
over
the
surface
co2
streamed
quickly
upward
and
for
quite
some
time
actually
smell
seemed
very
typical
for
the
most
part
with
special
attention
paid
to
the
sour
element
that
always
seems
to
be
present
taste
too
seemed
particularly
sour
and
delightfully
sweet
not
bad
im
sure
there
are
much
better
examples
of
this
style
out
there
but
this
is
decent
thanks
to
ding
for
bringing
me
this
drinkability
i
was
a
bit
nervous
as
this
is
the
first
gueuze
ive
had
much
more
drinkable
than
the
other
lambics
ive
had
ill
have
to
explore
this
style
in
more
depth
when
the
opportunity
arises
im
sure
there
are
better
ones
out
there
but
this
served
as
a
good
introduction
for
me
and
left
me
with
a
favorable
impression
of
the
style
cheers
pours
a
clear
golden
honey
color
with
a
creamy
head
that
quickly
diminishes
to
a
ring
the
smell
is
a
combination
of
citrusy
fruit
combined
with
an
earthy
hay
aroma
the
taste
is
a
pleasant
balance
of
souracidic
green
apple
and
mildly
sweet
honey
the
lindemans
gueuze
is
light
bodied
but
the
carbonation
is
a
little
low
for
this
style
giving
it
a
slightly
thicker
mouthfeel
the
finish
is
dry
with
an
enjoyable
tartness
that
lingers
between
sips
overall
a
good
beer
that
is
very
drinkable
but
not
one
youre
going
to
have
a
lot
of
in
one
sitting
i
think
it
would
go
well
with
a
light
shellfish
meal
been
wanting
to
try
this
style
bought
at
a
whole
foods
store
light
amber
in
color
not
wat
i
was
expecting
light
head
smells
like
most
lambics
i
have
ever
had
begins
light
and
sweet
finishs
with
a
heavier
grapefruit
like
sourness
very
light
carbonation
very
easy
to
drink
not
as
funky
as
i
expected
but
very
sweet
and
tart
very
nice
funky
smell
it
was
worth
the
5
bucks
i
paid
for
it
drinkability
is
pretty
low
i
cant
think
of
a
food
id
want
to
pair
this
with
except
maybe
ice
cream
if
i
wanted
a
soda
id
drink
one
if
i
wanted
an
alcopop
which
this
tastes
quite
a
bit
like
id
have
my
head
examined
if
i
want
a
lambic
id
buy
something
else
pours
a
brilliant
coppered
amber
with
a
wonderful
white
lacing
and
thin
head
that
clings
to
the
glass
aroma
wreaks
strongly
of
brie
cheese
and
mildly
of
battery
acid
and
candied
sugar
not
nearly
as
funky
as
most
geuze
taste
is
very
sweet
and
faro
like
almost
like
i
would
imagine
a
lemon
faro
would
be
candied
sugar
and
citrus
are
dominant
funk
is
so
mild
very
tasty
and
nice
but
not
terribly
gauze
like
not
funky
and
nasty
enough
for
me
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
sweet
rather
than
dirty
and
sour
back
of
the
palate
gets
hit
with
carbonation
and
some
pleasant
sourness
overall
very
enjoyable
but
not
too
exciting
nor
authentic
also
too
costly
now
on
to
the
beer
as
with
many
belgian
beers
im
torn
when
i
get
to
the
drinkability
part
i
would
absolutely
not
drink
a
ton
of
these
despite
the
low
abv
but
its
crisp
pleasant
very
complex
wellmade
and
relatively
easy
to
find
id
get
it
again
for
sure
the
flavors
are
much
more
friendly
to
the
palate
than
some
of
the
harsher
more
sour
gueuzes
ive
tried
theres
an
excellent
balance
of
sweetness
and
sourness
with
just
a
touch
of
that
sweaty
yeastiness
that
helps
define
the
style
nothing
overly
acidic
but
nothing
overly
saccharine
either
along
with
a
wonderfully
creamy
mouthfeel
i
would
most
definitely
pick
this
up
again
i
did
rank
it
a
bit
low
on
the
drinkability
meter
as
i
find
these
hard
to
drink
any
more
frequently
than
every
now
and
then
no
matter
how
good
the
flavor
and
this
particular
offering
delivers
well
on
that
front
drinkability
the
maltiness
balances
well
with
the
acidic
bite
and
the
low
abv
makes
it
a
refreshing
hotday
brew
not
as
strong
as
other
beers
in
the
style
making
it
a
good
introduction
for
someone
new
to
the
style
pours
a
dark
amber
with
worm
high
lights
just
beneath
the
head
which
slowly
dissipates
i
was
expecting
champagne
like
effervescence
which
this
does
not
produce
the
smell
is
pleasant
slight
sent
of
grapes
like
fermented
cider
citrus
and
apple
skins
the
sent
also
has
a
minor
metallic
note
however
this
is
not
over
powering
or
displeasing
the
taste
seems
more
tame
than
other
lambics
ive
had
the
others
ive
had
seem
more
vinegary
or
kombucha
like
which
i
am
told
is
desirable
maybe
my
taste
is
just
under
developed
but
this
is
more
my
speed
at
this
time
ive
also
been
told
that
this
lambic
is
made
particulary
to
be
sold
to
wider
commercial
market
all
and
all
this
is
a
pleasant
beer
light
and
pleasing
i
would
buy
this
again
very
warm
and
smooth
mouthfeel
somewhat
creamy
yet
very
sharp
at
the
same
time
high
carbonation
and
easily
drinkable
i
think
im
the
newest
convert
to
lambics
would
definitely
recommend
this
to
any
beer
drinker
its
different
but
good
this
ones
a
good
sipper
but
nothing
too
amazing
body
is
rather
light
and
thin
with
a
bubbly
prickly
texture
and
slick
wet
mouthfeel
bottle
corked
and
capped
foil
wrapped
pours
a
clean
copper
orange
color
with
very
little
if
any
yeast
particles
visible
big
white
head
that
lasts
fine
lacing
in
the
goblet
ive
poured
into
nose
is
complex
and
strange
but
in
a
good
way
definitely
a
musty
read
old
damp
room
smell
that
actually
works
for
this
style
sweet
as
well
bittersweet
fruits
and
straw
palate
is
sweet
and
sour
but
maybe
the
sweet
wins
out
here
slight
vinegarlike
character
which
causes
the
mouth
to
water
something
i
actually
love
in
a
lambic
fruity
and
quite
smooth
through
the
vinegar
acidity
warms
to
a
smoother
malt
backbone
finishes
quite
dry
and
lively
with
aggressive
carbonation
levels
not
being
an
expert
in
the
gueuze
style
i
cant
say
how
it
stacks
up
to
its
competition
but
i
do
know
i
like
this
on
its
own
merits
best
lindemans
product
ive
had
by
far
makes
me
want
more
and
thats
got
to
be
a
good
thing
if
youre
not
familiar
with
a
gueuze
this
is
probably
a
good
safe
place
to
start
the
journey
the
flavor
is
very
clean
for
a
lambic
as
there
is
very
little
lactic
sourness
but
it
is
still
very
complex
it
begins
with
a
sharp
sour
bite
that
segues
into
an
applelike
flavor
and
then
a
light
sweetness
blends
into
the
barnyard
flavor
and
the
beer
finishes
clean
with
a
touch
of
the
green
apple
flavor
the
finish
is
very
sharp
and
lends
a
clean
finish
this
is
a
very
mild
lambic
but
it
is
still
a
good
lambic
as
it
allows
an
approchable
introduction
to
the
style
drinkabilitynotes
a
fine
example
of
the
style
certainly
not
to
be
missed
always
looking
to
try
classic
belgian
beer
styles
this
gueuze
is
very
drinkable
and
characterful
when
compared
to
others
the
beer
shows
a
firmer
malt
base
that
is
not
entirely
soured
this
gives
a
bit
of
sweetness
that
balances
out
the
sourness
leaves
the
beer
less
sour
and
astringent
than
most
the
faint
malt
flavor
do
however
begin
to
take
on
colalike
flavors
that
i
did
not
particularly
like
but
the
sweetness
from
that
makes
the
beer
much
more
drinkable
than
expected
and
giving
the
beer
a
more
caramelized
color
the
beer
remains
vineous
musky
woodsy
and
lightly
pungent
well
into
the
finish
with
cleanliness
and
crispness
well
worth
the
try
i
dont
have
a
lot
of
experience
with
gueuze
as
a
style
so
its
hard
to
compare
but
im
guessing
there
are
a
lot
better
ones
than
this
right
before
i
tried
lindemans
i
had
an
oud
gueze
beersel
and
thought
it
would
take
me
some
time
before
i
can
adapt
to
this
style
however
this
one
just
was
a
lot
milder
in
all
aspects
especially
the
sourness
factor
much
easier
to
drink
than
the
former
it
still
has
the
tart
hopless
taste
paired
okay
with
some
different
cheese
the
color
is
a
hazy
golden
orage
with
moderatw
carbonation
head
is
ultra
white
and
on
the
small
side
aroma
is
sweet
with
a
tart
berryfruit
smell
sip
starts
with
a
tart
combination
of
citris
and
berry
flavors
yeast
flavors
provide
an
interesting
edge
of
flavor
a
lightly
sweet
malt
base
is
nice
and
becomes
grainier
in
the
finish
a
touch
of
wheat
is
also
noted
drinkability
is
very
high
a
nice
though
somewhat
sticky
sweetness
sour

like
but
it
gets
the
job
done
a
little
too
user
friendly
but
will
do
in
a
pinch
pours
a

minimal

some

deal
with

musty

i
could
definately
see
this
being
a
refreshing

in

months
but
theres
no
way
in

id
buy
this
again
honestly
the
quality
does
not
match
up
with
the

the

is
a
way
better

and
way
better

the

it

smells

reminds
me
more
of
a
sparkling

still
pretty

d
delicious
great

awesome
overall
impression
very
drinkable
balanced
and
easy
on
the
palate
you
dont
have
to
reach
for
this
one
it
comes
to
you
a
good
introduction
to
the
more
hard
core
lambic
beers
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
enjoyed
doesnt
begin
to
compare
with
unsweetened
traditional
lambics
but
its
tasty
in
its
way
this
was
the
first
gueuze
lambic
that
i
have
ever
tasted
this
beer
poured
a
golden
color
with
little
to
no
head
it
was
very
carbonated
the
aroma
was
sweet
and
slightly
sour
i
found
the
flavor
to
be
bizar
and
complex
it
was
very
sour
and
sweet
with
the
flavor
of
apples
and
possibly
pears
it
also
slightly
bitter
the
finish
was
rather
musty
or
earthy
and
i
found
this
rather
unpleasant
it
was
a
facinating
beer
to
try
but
the
sourness
and
the
unpleasant
aftertaste
lowered
its
drinkability
in
my
opinion
poured
this
12
oz
corked
bottle
into
a
lindemans
flute
it
is
a
clear
deep
straw
color
with
a
heavy
lasting
1
to
1
inch
head
with
nice
lacing
the
smell
is
a
tart
and
smells
like
medicine
it
has
a
very
sharp
light
clean
and
fizzy
mouthfeel
the
flavor
is
sweet
and
sour
but
very
smooth
tasting
like
honey
wood
oakhickory
and
citrus
a
good
beer
draws
fruit
flies
and
this
was
no
exception
had
several
unfortunate
casualties
i
am
very
skeptical
in
my
early
stages
of
trying
lambics
and
this
one
surprised
me
it
is
quite
a
good
beer
it
has
a
nice
blend
of
sweet
and
tart
due
to
its
mixture
gueuze
flavor
is
decent
apple
dominates
everywhere
some
lemon
overall
it
is
good
but
there
are
better
gueuze
styles
out
there
opinion
this
is
no
cuvee
renee
this
gueuze
would
be
one
for
someone
just
exploring
the
world
of
sour
beers
it
isnt
bad
tasting
but
it
is
very
mild
and
reserved
compared
to
most
beers
in
this
style
there
is
a
tad
of
tartness
and
a
bit
of
the
earthy
flavoraroma
but
it
remains
pretty
much
balanced
the
entire
time
if
you
dont
know
what
a
gueuze
istry
this
one
before
shelling
out
20
for
a
bottle
of
cantillon
if
you
already
like
gueuze
i
would
buy
something
elselike
a
girardin
or
an
oud
beersel
or
some
such
this
is
like
a
pretend
gueuze
the
aroma
was
of
apples
more
than
anything
followed
by
wheat
and
sour
fruits
the
flavor
was
the
same
mostly
a
tart
cider
with
yeast
and
sweetsour
hints
it
had
a
lot
of
carbonation
to
start
but
as
the
glass
warmed
and
the
flavors
became
more
intense
the
carbonation
died
down
i
feel
that
the
sweetness
became
slightly
sourer
towards
the
end
but
it
still
finished
crisp
and
refreshing
definitely
a
must
try
for
lambic
fans
everywhere
peachy
smell
almost
like
the
peche
but
a
little
more
understated
very
sour
but
only
a
7
or
so
on
the
sour
scale
when
i
think
about
a
flemish
peachy
and
yeasty
and
dry
very
appetizing
theres
a
nice
spritz
in
the
middle
of
the
medium
body
drinkability
is
pretty
high
wow
this
is
enjoyable
clear
deep
gold
with
a
solid
ring
of
bubbles
and
plenty
of
carbonation
the
light
was
hitting
it
just
right
nose
had
an
ever
so
slight
funkiness
i
thought
maybe
the
beer
was
too
cold
this
beer
is
simply
too
sweet
and
too
fruity
there
is
no
tartness
or
barnyard
to
balance
it
this
is
a
gueuze
that
my
spouse
would
enjoy
which
i
believe
eliminates
it
from
being
a
part
of
the
lambic
family
the
lindemans
brews
are
like
belgian
version
malternatives
of
course
this
is
drinkable
there
is
nothing
remotely
threatening
about
this
beer
but
the
fear
of
the
novice
mispronouncing
the
name
this
should
be
a
complex
melding
of
flavors
not
an
excellent
choice
to
accompany
your
cake
and
ice
cream
all
in
all
this
is
what
i
would
consider
a
beginner
lambic
probably
doctored
to
make
it
suitable
for
more
palates
taste
is
where
it
goes
downhill
sweet
really
sweet
and
fruity
sour
apples
compared
to
the
complex
aroma
the
taste
is
too
basic
and
overly
sweet
mouth
is
crisp
up
front
but
becomes
sticky
sweet
just
overwhelming
very
tough
to
get
through
this
one
just
overly
sweetened
asiago
does
not
go
well
overpowers
the
subtle
flavors
of
the
beer
the
other
two
work
help
cut
the
sourness
a
bit
a
lightly
sour
bite
starts
things
off
with
the
sweeter
peachy
flavors
following
close
behind
not
very
tart
at
all
with
a
slightly
saccharine
aftertaste
and
a
very
light
body
the
carbonation
makes
it
feel
all
the
more
ethereal
i
wish
it
were
more
tart
drinkability
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
i
dont
know
how
much
funk
i
should
be
expecting
from
the
style
i
expected
a
lot
but
didnt
receive
anything
i
thought
was
particularly
funky
my
first
outing
with
some
flemish
reds
was
a
much
bigger
shock
this
is
very
approachable
and
i
recommend
it
as
a
starter
from
one
newcomer
of
the
style
to
another
overall
better
than
i
expected
but
not
as
good
as
their
gueuze
cuvee
rene
i
like
this
style
to
be
a
bit
more
on
the
sour
and
funky
side
vice
the
fruitysweet
nevertheless
a
decent
version
of
the
style
a
copper
colored
lambic
with
a
mild
amount
of
carbonation
this
beer
smells
like
your
typical
funky
lambic
yeast
wet
hay
cork
etc
but
in
a
very
mellow
way
it
tastes
fruity
and
sour
with
notes
of
lemon
apple
peach
but
all
of
these
flavors
are
quite
subdued
i
prefer
lambics
with
a
bit
more
of
an
assertive
sourness
however
this
one
is
still
pretty
good
has
a
clean
amber
color
with
a
big
beige
head
and
a
nice
lace
effect
the
aroma
is
very
fruity
almost
apple
and
sour
but
in
a
mouthwatering
way
the
floavor
is
a
light
fruity
sweetness
with
hints
of
apples
and
cherries
the
finish
is
sour
and
dry
yet
not
suck
your
cheeks
in
sour
refreshing
small
bottle
caped
and
corked
pours
a
dull
orangy
amber
white
head
quickly
morphs
to
a
thin
film
and
leaves
just
a
tad
of
lacing
nose
is
very
crisp
sour
and
fruity
this
is
a
sour
style
of
beer
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
and
not
for
all
beer
lovers
its
an
acquired
taste
and
these
beers
tend
to
grow
on
you
as
you
try
them
more
this
one
is
fruity
refreshingcomplex
and
moderatly
sour
from
start
to
finish
went
well
with
a
waldorf
salad
and
would
be
right
for
all
sorts
of
lighter
fare
salads
dessert
fish
etc
pours
a
nice
fizzy
red
the
smell
is
wonderful
and
full
of
apples
and
bananas
the
taste
is
very
sharp
crisp
and
clean
and
again
full
of
apples
strong
flavored
much
like
how
a
good
wine
should
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
too
thin
but
the
drinkability
is
through
the
roof
pours
a
nice
hazy
golden
color
with
good
carbonation
and
a
nice
white
head
i
can
smell
a
skunky
hop
aroma
before
i
near
the
brew
upon
closer
sniffing
a
nice
efferevesensce
hits
my
my
nose
full
of
apple
type
acidic
fruityness
taste
is
definitely
heavy
on
the
apples
up
front
then
dries
into
a
nice
sour
fruity
taste
only
to
finish
with
a
cardboard
type
aftertaste
that
really
detracts
excellent
dry
mouthfeel
with
good
carbonation
make
this
quite
a
drinkable
brew
i
fear
my
tummy
will
fight
back
against
this
acidic
brew
though
so
drinkability
is
decreased
a
nice
change
up
from
a
capped
and
corked
12
ounce
bottle
it
pours
a
slightly
hazy
gold
with
a
persistent
white
head
that
seems
to
remain
at
14
inch
no
matter
how
long
it
sits
the
smell
is
on
the
tart
side
but
with
some
sweetness
in
the
background
unfortunately
the
taste
is
surprisingly
sweet
and
seemingly
artificially
so
it
almost
seems
like
a
highclass
and
tart
malt
beverage
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
thick
side
its
a
bit
disappointing
beer
is
good
happy
goooze
beering
the
taste
was
very
tart
yet
slightly
sweet
with
a
bit
of
cherry
fruitiness
evident
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
and
one
that
i
could
drink
several
of
if
it
were
less
expensive
pours
a
dark
golden
semicloudy
color
with
a
huge
head
that
slowly
collapses
aroma
has
some
sweetness
floating
around
a
much
stronger
sourtart
sharpness
decent
aroma
flavor
is
sharp
and
tart
with
a
sourapple
candy
sensation
fruit
sensation
is
not
strong
has
gueuze
flavor
profile
but
is
the
sweetest
gueuze
i
have
tried
to
date
this
has
the
odd
effect
of
raising
drinkability
for
uninitiated
americans
like
me
but
takes
it
away
from
its
traditions
ah
this
style
still
works
on
me

am
beginning
to
appreciate

bottle
aged
nicely
very
mellow
o
this
was
my
first
true
belgian
gueuze
and
boy
is
it
good
im
not
one
to
pick
up
sours
on
a
regular
basis
but
i
do
enjoy
them
throughout
the
year
on
certain
occasions
this
isnt
like
the
great
fruit
forward
lambics
everyone
has
had
this
is
bringing
much
more
than
just
one
dominant
fruit
flavor
exceptional
sour
great
horseblanket
and
funk
going
on
moderate
sourness
a
touch
dry
nice
brew
would
serve
well
as
an
introduction
for
someone
looking
to
try
lambics
or
sour
beers
very
tart
and
acidic
but
well
balanced
enough
to
keep
it
from
becoming
astringent
taste
was
very
metallic
and
skunky
and
did
not
have
a
tart
sour
taste
like
style
should
have
i
was
very
disappointed
but
hoping
to
try
this
again
sometime
but
will
buy
from
a
different
liquor
store
lemony
tart
nose
with
hints
of
wet
horse
blanket
the
barnyard
nose
is
more
restrained
in
this
than
some
other
gueuzes
it
pours
hazy
light
golden
straw
with
a
persistent
very
stiff
rocky
finely
bubbled
pure
white
3
foam
cap
the
beer
has
a
big
citrus
character
with
lemon
standing
out
with
just
enough
sweetness
to
prevent
your
mouth
from
puckering
overall
it
is
very
dry
and
refreshing
the
body
is
incredible
very
creamy
smooth
and
effervescent
with
a
very
fine
bead
it
improves
nicely
with
age
taste
has
musty
hints
of
aged
cheese
and
white
pepper
along
with
sour
lemon
candy
a
champagne
like
feel
and
a
very
dry
finish
a
remarkable
gueze
o
this
is
a
classic
that
im
surprised
to
have
not
reviewed
yet
its
a
solid
geueze
that
brings
all
the
components
and
would
be
a
nice
introduction
for
someone
who
is
looking
to
expand
hisher
palate
in
belgian
lambics
it
has
plenty
of
the
hallmark
aromas
and
flavours
that
geuezes
tend
to
have
but
with
a
general
softness
behind
these
that
wont
immediately
push
you
away
from
the
glass
overall
45
a
great
example
of
a
traditional
geuze
overall
this
is
my
first
foray
into
gueuze
territory
and
it
may
be
safe
to
say
im
hooked
so
much
yeast
character
so
little
hop
influence
such
intensity
of
flavor
without
sacrificing
complexity
this
does
seem
to
peg
the
style
guidelines
well
im
trying
to
get
into
these
gueuze
type
beers
lately
as
i
enjoy
sour
food
items
like
grapefruit
and
sweettarts
this
one
just
didnt
really
fly
for
me
i
may
need
to
give
it
a
second
chance
body
is
a
perfect
peach
pulp
in
tone
head
is
an
easy
two
inches
of
crackling
foamy
light
beige
nose
is
super
funky
and
full
of
interesting
smells
horse
blanket
lime
stone
and
lemon
zest
all
play
very
evidently
there
is
even
a
bit
of
soap
playing
here
with
first
sip
you
are
almost
shocked
by
how
much
is
going
on
here
initial
mouth
filling
funk
is
spawned
by
citrus
zest
and
stone
sour
dryness
as
you
drink
the
sourness
rounds
out
a
bit
and
becomes
wonderfully
dry
and
drinkable
enjoyable
and
quite
sessionable
a
standard
of
the
style
appropriately
bubbly
with
a
sharp
tang
at
the
beginning
followed
up
by
the
dry
tart
citrus
finishes
very
easy
nice
complexity
but
slightly
offbalanced
i
would
like
to
see
more
focus
on
the
sour
notes
as
opposed
to
the
funk
and
spices
still
worth
a
try
looks
like
a
pale
ale
ultra
carbonated
with
a
huge
head
that
does
not
like
to
subside
smells
like
funky
sour
cider
very
tart
and
effervescent
but
no
easily
descriptive
flavor
very
interesting
really
wasnt
expecting
a
gueuze
this
good
at
the
price
i
will
be
getting
more
soon
very
interesting
taste
didnt
like
it
at
first
but
then
this
is
a
pretty
good
entry
level
gueuze
with
some
solid
flavors
pours
an
opaque
deep
gold
with
a
swiftly
rising
column
of
effervescent
bubbles
geysering
from
the
bottom
of
the
goblet
where
the
stem
is
attached
the
pour
produces
1
5
fingers
of
champagne
like
rapidly
declining
effervescent
white
head
that
recedes
to
a
solid
18th
inch
cap
of
dense
foam
leaving
wisps
of
lacing
aroma
is
dominated
by
sour
apples
oranges
tart
lemons
backed
by
barnyard
wet
hay
brett
yeast
mustiness
phenolic
hints
with
something
like
lime
sherbet
mixed
with
blue

a
little

buried
underneath

with
brett
like
barnyard
funk
orange

very
tart
green
apples
mix
with

cream
finishes
smooth
mellow
fruity
bitter
but
the
flavours
are
short
lived
producing
an
aftertaste
that
is
a
rapidly
fading
wet
hay
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
dry
slightly
chalky
bracingly
tart
very
crisp
with
a
faint
prickle
astringency
mouthfeel
is
right
champagne
like
this
is
a
top
notch
brew
i
read
garret
olivers
selection
on
guezes
after
this
and
wish
it
were
the
other
way
around
i
definitely
plan
on
a
food
paring
with
this
beer
in
the
near
future
2012
vintage
still
tart
and
bubbly
what
else
can
i
say
about
this
i
wanted
to
like
it
and
was
disappointed
perhaps
it
is
too
radical
a
departure
from
the
type
of
beer
im
used
to
and
i
just
need
to
develop
a
taste
for
it
over
time
perhaps
it
is
just
not
my
style
well
see
o
easy
drinking
with
just
enough
puckering
sourness
pungent
bitter
not
the
best
from
lindemans
which
i
normally
love
sour
3
of
the
day
and
probably
the
best
of
all
im
really
liking
the
funky
stuff
lately
the
nose
on
this
beet
is
insane
i
wish
my
wife
would
wear
this
as
a
perfume
i
dont
the
she
wants
a
slight
scent
of
horse
blanket
but
it
would
do
it
for
me

man
does
this

the

makes
it
difficult

it
is
very
easy

rapidly
sip
on
this
one
very
much
enjoyed
this
one
as
my
first
geuze
and
will
definitely
be
seeking
out
more
theres
no

hence
the

at

puckers

oa

thats

and
not

will
definitely
be
picking
up
a
couple
other
bottles
to
age
and
see
how
this
blended
lambic
progresses
as
it
matures
o
this
is
a

for
its

o
a
real
treat
tons
of
exciting

really
refreshing
the
cuvée
is
waaay
better
than
the
ordinary
gueuze
a
solid
gueuze
not
the
most
complex
but
its
got
a
great
flavor
and
fits
the
style
definitely
cant
go
wrong
with
it
and
with
a
low
bottle
price
its
worth
keeping
around
all
the
time
i
heard
that
this
beer
is
a
good
starter
to
introduce
yourself
to
this
particular
style
so
looked
around
and
found
one
that
was
brewed
on
2011
uncorking
it
i
was
hit
with
a
loud
pop
from
all
of
the
carbonation
and
bright
notes
of
apple
and
pear
on
the
nose
after
pouring
it
i
was
able
to
appreciate
its
flavor
much
more
it
has
bright
notes
of
crisp
apple
and
a
slight
undertone
of
bread
with
a
funky
kick
to
it
as
well
on
the
palate
it
has
wonderful
rich
fruit
flavor
of
apple
pear
and
peach
with
a
sour
tone
to
give
it
a
tangy
flavor
also
there
are
wonderful
undertones
of
oak
and
bread
all
tied
together
with
a
funky
tang
to
give
it
weight
hopefully
after
i
sample
other
beers
in
this
category
i
will
be
able
to
broaden
my
palate
and
appreciate
them
more
however
for
now
i
really
love
it
overall
this
is
a
good
lambic
it
is
not
very
complex
and
it
lacks
the
fruit
component
at
least
it
lacks
one
specific
fruit
component
that
i
am
used
to
from
lindemans
but
overall
it
is
a
solid
offering
personally
i
would
prefer
the
lambics
from
lindemans
that
are
flavored
with
apple
pear
peach
etc
o
wow
funky
sour
tart
balanced
great
bear
will
definitely
buy
again
i
really
liked
this
one
from
lindemans
much
better
than
some
of
their
fruited
stuff
and
a
much
lighter
take
on
they
style
than
is
available
from
others
its
crystal
clear
after
i
pour
from
the
capped
and
corked
green
glass
bottle
radiantly
clear
really
yeast
cake
remains
on
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
head
is
fizzy
and
white
but
settles
quickly
and
there
is
a
real
champagne
sort
of
look
to
it
the
nose
is
only
a
bit
sour
its
still
definitely
blended
lambic
no
mistake
about
that
but
it
hass
less
of
the
lactic
hotness
of
others
instead
having
a
light
wheat
malt
flavor
and
some
yeast
character
other
than
sourness
its
meadowy
springy
floral
and
very
delicate
not
a
lugging
weighty
gueuze
but
one
to
really
drink
up
like
a
glass
of
spring
white
wine
it
seems
to
be
the
perfect
compliment
to
a
chickpea
curry
but
i
can
see
it
working
in
about
a
million
food
contexts
this
is
a
good
beer
to
introduce
folks
to
the
style
with
too
its
less
caustically
acidic
but
equally
refined
as
the
others
i
like
it
quite
a
bit
and
am
more
excited
to
crack
the
bottle
of
faro
lambic
in
the
fridge
now
too
great
beer
perfect
for
introductory
gueuze
drinking
o
i
was
hoping
for
more
tart
bite
throughout
but
this
beer
did
grow
on
me
the
transition
from
sour
to
regular
beer
did
take
some
getting
used
to
however
the
finish
is
clean
and
elegant
the
previous
beer
left
a
earwax
taste
in
my
mouth
that
lingered
but
this
beer
has
cleaned
it
away
quite
wonderfully
and
now
i
taste
almost
cherrylike
freshness
amidst
the
sour
after
notes
poured
into
a
lindemans
stange
pours
a
bright
golden
amber
with
a
two
finger
pure
white
head
with
good
retention
and
lots
of
lacing
aroma
of
fruit
and
sourness
are
evident
immediately
on
opening
the
bottle
which
is
both

capped

kinda
classy
aroma
in
the
glass
is
similar
sour

is
lemon

apple
and
grape
juice
very
tart
with
wild
yeast
funkiness
finishes
tart
and
funky
with
hints
of
woodiness
nice
active
carbonation
makes
it
look
good
in
the
glass
and
gives
a
nice
mouth
feel
the
tart
fruit
and
yeast
funk
were
actually
not
too
much
more
intense
than
other
old
lambics
which
worked
well
for
me
im
not
a
big
sour
fan
but
wanted
to
try
this
style
and
this
satisfied
my
taste
for
a
champagne
like
light
sour
ale
a
fairly
classy
looking
bottle
and
it
looks
great
in
the
glass
if
i
liked
sours
a
bit
more
this
would
be
in
my
fridge
all
the
time
really
a
fun
beer
to
share
with
others
and
watch
people
guess
all
the
aromas
and
what
they
are
tasting
in
it
great
beer
two
words
quality
beer
liight
orange
towards
golden
in
color
hazy
pours
with
a
rich
2
finger
head
that
dissipates
rather
quickly
leaving
the
slightest
amount
of
foam
on
the
surface
of
the
beer
and
lacing
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
nice
sour
think
green
apple
citrusy
aroma
made
me
want
to
taste
the
beer
starts
slightly
acidic
and
citrusy
the
progresses
to
a
nice
smooth
sour
finish
that
is
slightly
tart
at
the
end
i
found
the
taste
refreshing
and
thirstquenching
light
to
medium
body
lots
of
light
carbonation
that
leaves
a
slight
tingly
sensation
in
your
mouth
overall
i
found
this
beer
to
be
a
solid
sour
that
i
would
enjoy
drinking
again
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
decent
beer
and
as
far
as
i
can
tell
i
think
its
a
pretty
average
example
of
the
style
and
it
doesnt
really
have
any
tastes
or
aromas
that
i
think
are
really
well
done
it
kind
of
falls
right
in
the
middle
and
that
skunky
and
overly
earthy
aspect
doesnt
help
this
beer
didnt
have
good
drinkability
it
wasnt
too
smooth
not
too
clean
pretty
crisp
slightly
prickly
not
too
filling
and
the
taste
didnt
do
the
best
job
at
holding
my
attention
and
i
think
half
is
a
little
more
than
enough
for
me
and
im
glad
that
im
splitting
this
bottle
with
my
brother
and
theres
no
way
i
would
want
to
drink
another
one
in
a
row
what
i
like
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
appearance
it
was
pretty
good
and
to
me
it
was
the
highlight
of
this
beer
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
the
skunky
aspect
and
the
overly
earthy
flavors
if
this
beer
didnt
have
those
it
might
be
a
lot
better
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
but
i
would
make
sure
its
a
pretty
fresh
bottle
since
i
dont
think
aged
was
too
kind
to
this
beer
and
as
it
stands
now
i
dont
think
i
would
recommend
it
all
in
all
i
was
disappointed
with
this
beer
i
had
heard
good
things
about
and
i
thought
it
would
turn
out
to
be
a
good
sour
but
it
just
had
too
many
off
aspects
and
in
the
end
that
really
hurt
this
beer
this
just
might
be
my
least
favorite
gueuze
and
my
least
favorite
beer
from
this
brewery
better
luck
next
time
guys
this
one
just
wasnt
for
me
but
i
hope
to
try
a
fresher
bottle
in
the
future
prost
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
belgian
tulip
glass
overall
this
beer
just
misses
the
mark
id
read
from
multiple
sources
that
this
was
lindemans
best
offering
and
if
so
that
is
entirely
disappointing
i
had
hoped
to
find
a
readily
available
and
reasonably
priced
gueuze
but
that
is
simply
not
the
case
ill
stick
to
st
louis
fond
tradition
and
tilquin
for
my
accessible
gueuze
needs
verdict
a
very
nice
gueuze
from
lindemans
surprisingly
good
relative
to
the
rest
of
their
lineup
which
is
unfortunately
artificially
sweetened
its
a
bit
dirtier
and
heavier
for
a
gueuze
than
i
prefer
but
for
the
availability
and
price
point
its
a
remarkable
value
kudos
to
lindemans
for
this
fine
stuff
overall
this
is
a
great
choice
for
a
regularly
available
shelf
gueuze
its
not
a
complex
or
entirely
memorable
experience
but
it
is
a
clean
enjoyable
and
refreshing
sour
beer
drinkability
its
a
very
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
with
good
flavors
and
aromas
o
excellent
if
you
like
funky
sour
beers
this
one
is
a
no
brainer
overall
it
was
good
but
i
wouldnt
pay
the
15
to
have
it
again
im
not
accustomed
to
gueze
styles
though
i
do
enjoy
sours
but
found
this
a
little
overpowering
if
you
dont
typically
drink
sours
i
would
build
up
to
this
bottle
from
bottle
barn
on
my
trip
to
cali
shared
with
beastmaster
dated
may
2013
poured
on

pours
a
slight
cloudy
deep

color
with
a
half

white
head
aroma
of
sour
mint
leaves
some
light
citrus
dusty
oak
sweet
candy
sugars
mmmm
flavor
is
citrusy
very
lightly
sour
for
a
geueze
and
not
as
dry
as
i
expected
some
juicy
pear
an
lots
of
sweet
and
sour
flavors
going
on
a
o
good
drinkability
classic
belgian
fruity
lambic
character
classic
i
am
hunting
for
this
everywhere
i
go
and
would
love
to
find
it
on
tap
overall
one
of
the
better
readily
available
gueuzes
and
the
price
point
rocks
pours
a
nice
medium
head
with
dark
yellow
color
cant
put
my
finger
on
how
it
smells
it
smells
like
a
typical
lambic
beer
is
all
i
can
say
taste
is
somewhat
champagne
but
no
sweetness
nice
carbonation
sour
and
a
very
slight
bitterness
at
the
finish
tastes
like
it
smells
has
that
funkyness
that
everyone
talks
about
a
very
nice
beer
this
is
a
great
gueuze
perhaps
not
as
extremely
sour
as
some
example
its
full
of
complexity
and
funk
a
standard
for
the
style
and
a
must
try
i
find
the
other
lambics
of
this
brewery
to
be
too
sweet
o
very
enjoyable
a
little
less
sour
than
i
would
like
very
good
and
much
better
than
i
expected
from
lindemans
my
only
other
memorable
experience
being
with
their
framboise
before
i
really
drank
beer
o
tasty
and
interesting
but
not
overly
complex
flavors
are
not
particularly
bold
or
clear
but
the
lightness
to
the
brew
makes
it
enjoyable
some
to
the
character
of
this
brew
is
a
direct
result
of
its
age
10
months
older
might
be
much
better
on
this
style
as
my
initial
gueuze
i
was
really
pleased
with
this
one
lots
of
head
on
the
pour
lots
of
little
tight
little
bubbbles
hazy
orange
color
the
nose
is
initially
a
little
tangy
a
little
funk
followed
by
some
green
apples
or
white
grapes
with
sourdough
bread
maybe
my
favorite
part
taste
followed
the
smell
for
me
strong
tart
and
sour
green
apples
and
farmy
funk
on
top
of
the
bready
sourdough
flavor
very
tight
bubbles
and
finishes
extremely
dry
o
not
a
bad
brew
but
i
expected
more
of
a
complex
profile
it
wouldve
been
nicer
for
the
flavors
to
be
more
prominent
and
for
the
mouth
to
be
a
bit
more
heavy
just
a
tiny
bit
but
i
like
the
light
carby
feel
o

one

introductions
to
the

and
i
will
definitely
be
back
for
more
very
effervescent
tangy
acidic
to
some
extent
reminiscent
of
a
champagne
to
my
palate
dry
from
the
pour
until
long
after
the
swallow
is
done
a
750
solo
may
not
have
been
my
best
idea
but
its
something
ill
just
have
to
do
b
outside
of
cantillon
this
is
the
best
gueuze
i
have
ever
tried
while
i
have
enjoyed
the
fruitier
lambics
from
lindemans
this
is
clearly
their
masterpiece
a
complex
classic
with
crisp
citrus
flavors
a
refreshingly
bitter
dry
tartness
and
long
lasting
finish
o
sour
beers
really
do
it
for
me
so
i
liked
this
beer
quite
a
lot
almost
by
default
having
said
that
i
felt
like
as
an
experience
it
fell
a
bit
flat
both
in
terms
of
looking
for
a
more
complex
tasting
experience
as
well
as
a
more
lively
and
satisfying
mouthfeel
expected
a
slightly
higher
quality
brew
such
as
that
of
the
aforementioned
petrus
i
can
imagine
having
a
gueuze
which
will
really
knock
my
socks
off
though
bring
on
the
cantillon3f
very
musky
sour
excellent
carbonation
bottled
11
months
prior
to
tasting
light
color
clear
until
you
get
to
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
pour
then
cloudy
slighty
sour
from
front
to
back
but
not
intensely
tart
like
some
other
sours
for
the
price
a
excellent
beer
mild
hints
of
apple
and
grass
will
be
buying
a
few
more
and
cellaring
to
see
what
a
few
more
years
does
o
really
quite
an
enjoyable
beer
my
first
experience
with
the
type
and
i
want
more
i
find
the
tartness
and
funkyness
to
be
so
very
different
than
what
i
am
used
to
drinking
it
is
a
great
and
exciting
change
of
pace
that
i
will
seek
out
in
the
future
a
warm
sourness
permeates
throughout
your
mouth
slight
yeast
flavor
but
the
tartness
overcomes
oily
like
butter
very
sharp
and
almost
musty
the
flavor
of
this
thing
pops
i
mean
just
pops
amazing
tastes
like
fresh
leather
sour
apricot
non
salted
popcorn

who
would
have
known
that
lindemans
made
such
a
great
gueze
pick
it
up
if
youre
getting
into
this
style
of
beer
as
this
is
an
excellent
representation
of
the
style
overall
one
of
the
best
balanced
gueuze
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
drinking
im
aging
a
few
of
i
have
left
see
what
happens
with
this
big
boy
in
a
few
years
time
ill
probably
chuck
out
another
review
overall
this
is
my
first
gueuze
and
i
dont
think
i
will
be
addicted
to
sours
considering
the
hefty
8
dollar
admission
but
it
was
overall
a
great
experience
i
liked
this
beer
it
is
something
that
i
will
seek
out
to
try
again
o
i
feel
like
these
bottles
are
a
bit
of
a
crapshoot
while
im
aware
lambicsguezes
can
be
highly
variable
in
flavors
based
on
the
random
bacteria
introduced
if
the
results
are
not
drinkable
then
why
would
they
bottle
a
particular
batch
considering
other
mass
available
sours
available
this
is
a
terrible
choice
with
a
much
better
choice
being
the
duchesse
de
bourgogne
little
bit
of
funk
lots
of
sour
and
enough
malt
presence
to
tie
things
together
lacks
slightly
in
character
compared
to
some
but
a
good
sour
for
those
who
are
into
that
sort
of
thing
my
first
foray
into
gueuzeland
corked
bottle
pours
a
honey
amber
with
the
froth
you
would
expect
from
this
style
aroma
is
acidic
funky
sour
fruit
some
barnyard
with
vinous
overtones
like
balsamic
vinegar
taste
starts
with
lemon
and
pina
colada
quickly
shifts
to
sour
vinegar
ripe
honey
white
grape
gooseberry
unripe
bramble
fruit
all
tied
together
by
an
earthy
funk
that
at
times
veers
into
unpleasant
pukey
territory
but
this
is
probably
my
inexperience
with
lambic
its
gets
better
and
more
interesting
as
i
tough
it
out
all
acid
and
no
bitter
this
has
a
reputation
as
a
good
starter
gueuze
and
id
recommend
it
as
such
morbidly
curious
regarding
what
a
more
advanced
gueuze
would
taste
like
underneath
the
sour
persists
a
pleasant
tropical
fruitiness
and
some
cork
not
too
hard
to
track
down
if
you
want
to
dabble
in
this
style
overall
so
so
good
the
price
is
right
the
beer
is
incredibly
complex
while
remaining
balanced
with
none
of
the
flavors
overpowering
the
others
they
all
work
together
like
a
symphony
i
would
definitely
buy
this
again
this
is
what
beer
should
be
i
dont
know
what
else
i
can
say
about
it
atmosphere
is
really
good
great
head
and
plenty
of
lacing
nose
is
sour
fruits
and
bread
tastes
like
it
smells
bready
grains
accentuated
with
sour
fruity
tones
overall
this
is
a
really
good
quaff
o
not
too
sure
about
this
one
its
pretty
acidic
a
fairly
mild
and
refreshing
sour
it
has
a
pleasant
floral
cheese
quality
to
it
it
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
little
bit
of
head
it
is
lightly
sweet
up
front
and
then
a
mild
sour
that
doesnt
linger
for
very
long
it
has
a
light
thin
and
lively
body
not
my
favorite
sour
but
definitely
a
good
one
this
is
probably
the
best
affordable
oude
gueuze
on
the
market
i
believe
i
paid
7
or
so
for
this
i
do
wish
lindemans
had
kept
working
these
sour
musty
aromas
in
their
fruitbased
beers
as
they
have
a
great
rustic
profile
oh
well
at
least
theres
cuvée
rené
recommended
much
better
than
other
large
gueuze
makers
in
belgium
this
is
a
definite
buy
again
for
10
99
it
is
the
cheapest
and
in
my
opinion
one
of
the
best
gueuzes
on
the
market
o
leaps
and
bounds
better
than
their
sweet
lambics
this
doesnt
measure
up
to
other
geuezes
overall
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
this
has
all
of
the
sourness
and
funk
thats
missing
from
lindemans
fruit
lambics
if
youre
a
fan
of
the
style
this
is
a
great
bang
for
your
buck
710
sourness
not
a
bad
geuze
especially
at
12
a
750ml
o
my
first
gueuze
and
it
was
a
very
pleasant
experience
drinking
this
has
opened
a
world
of
beer
attributes
to
me
i
think
thats
why
this
style
is
so
interesting
the
blend
of
flavors
and
aromas
are
exclusive
to
the
gueuze
overall
good
newsits
still
great
bad
newsthe
aging
didnt
seem
to
do
a
thing
for
it
tastes
almost
exactly
like
a
fresh
one
still
definitely
enjoyed
it
aged
the
carbonation
is
mellow
fresh
its
beastly
i
like
that
its
exceptionally
creamy
but
its
so
much
so
that
it
just
expands
in
the
mouth
it
eases
off
with
time
but
when
youre
drinking
it
fresh
theres
such
a
thing
as
too
much
it
doesnt
take
much
off
though
and
it
still
starts
and
finishes
crisp
o
ill
admit
im
not
a
gueuze
expert
but
i
really
enjoyed
this
it
seemed
nicely
balanced
between
sour
and
acidic
it
was
complex
enough
to
keep
things
interesting
i
will
definitely
drink
this
again
overall
a
good
gueuze
style
beer
with
fruity
sourness
up
front
and
some
nice
lactic
tang
in
the
middle
however
it
doesnt
have
the
complex
funk
and
bugs
ive
experienced
in
other
examples
at
about
six
years
cuvee
rene
is
a
much
more
cleaner
and
straight
forward
gueuze
than
others
still
a
shelf
gueuze
that
delivers
overall
a
pretty
solid
version
of
the
style
and
certainly
a
good
introduction
but
better
ones
are
readily
available
fairly
clear
gold
with
some
random
flaky
bits
floating
around
topped
by
a
thin
wispy
head
smells
a
bit
grassy
and
earthy
like
wet
hay
and
flower
petals
along
with
barnyard
mustiness
spice
and
some
dry
wood
tart
earthy
flavors
not
extremely
sour
or
acidic
floral
dusty
lemons
and
mineral
notes
very
crisp
dry
light
and
fluffy
mouthfeel
with
a
refreshing
puckering
quality
this
is
good
and
certainly
has
all
the
right
elements
for
a
gueuze
though
no
standout
characteristics
for
the
price
laying
a
couple
bottles
away
to
have
a
few
years
down
the
road
is
a
nobrainer
very
nice
o
i
just
wasnt
crazy
about
that
little
funk
bit
in
the
end
but
otherwise
a
very
refreshing
beer
for
a
sticky
summer
eve
we
have
a
golden
hazy
beer
with
a
creamy
white
neck
the
aroma
and
taste
bring
oranges
and
grapefruit
with
a
touch
of
pepper
other
floral
and
fruit
pear
esters
and
expressive
barnyard
notes
caused
by
wild
yeast
the
tartness
is
vibrant
present
in
the
aroma
and
dominant
in
the
palate
the
body
is
light
and
its
acidity
balances
so
well
with
the
fruitness
and
structure
of
this
beer
the
gueuzes
are
refreshing
and
wonderful
belgian
beers
that
amaze
me
in
each
experience
the
cuvée
rene
is
simply
fantastic
poured
a
gorgeous
cloudy
orange
with
a
halffinger
white
head
there
was
no
lacing
on
the
glass
but
its
quite
the
good
looking
beer
scents
of
brettbarnyard
funk
lemon
sour
apple
and
slight
sweet
notes
flavor
is
incredibly
sour
with
notes
of
lemon
sour
apple
and
slight
vinegar
very
dry
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
this
is
a
very
good
beer
its
tart
dry
and
refreshing
its
also
not
for
everyone
its
incredibly
sour
natureis
fitting
only
for
those
of
us
who
like
things
sour
but
with
a
palette
that
enjoys
those
flavors
youll
find
it
excellent
the
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
golden
yellow
topped
by
a
fluffy
white
head
that
laces
the
nose
is
mildly
sour
slightly
skunkyfunky
with
a
sweet
citrusy
tartness
it
drinks
noticeably
funky
with
an
initial
sweetness
that
quickly
washes
away
and
leaves
behind
a
dry
slightly
grapefruit
rindy
bitterness
and
a
petri
dish
worth
of
culture
this
is
definitely
a
light
bodied
effervescent
straightforward
sour
thats
quite
approachable
however
it
has
a
bit
too
much
sweetness
and
lacks
the
super
dryness
i
look
for
in
good
gueuzes
i
think
it
also
lacks
some
of
the
complexity
id
expect
to
find
in
other
gueuzes
but
for
its
price
and
availability
this
is
a
solid
goto
gueuze
as
far
as
gueuzes
go
this
one
is
a
pretty
damn
good
standard
and
a
relatively
easy
introduction
into
a
more
difficult
style
poured
this
gueuze
from
a
750
ml
bottle
poured
a
hazy
golden
color
produced
a
thin
head
decent
retention
and
left
a
small
amount
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
consisted
of
light
malted
grain
and
tart
fruit
light
in
body
the
tartness
of
this
brew
comes
through
first
very
smooth
mouthfeel
malted
grain
earthy
undertones
and
finishes
dry
for
me
this
is
a
great
beginner
lambic
brew
ive
had
some
outstanding
lambics
this
done
is
simple
does
the
trick
o
this
is
my
first
geuze
and
i
am
surprised
that
lindemans
actually
releases
this
since
their
other
lambics
and
stuff
are
all
sweetened
to
my
knowledge
i
was
thinking
it
was
going
to
be
similar
to
the
rodenbach
classic
but
i
realize
now
that
that
is
a
different
style
quite
good
but
very
unlike
beer
and
more
like
kombucha
o
there
are
some
flavors
and
aromas
here
that
are
enjoyable
but
others
are
off
putting
and
not
quite
pleasant
overall
it
was
an
enjoyable
new
beer
experience
as
i
am
always
excited
to
expand
my
beer
horizons
really
quite
an
exceptional
fairly
unique
with
its
big
bright
aromas
and
flavors
by
far
the
best
lindemans
lambic
ive
had
and
in
no
way
does
it
seem
artificial
when
compared
to
there
overly
sweet
and
sugary
fruited
lambics
and
for
its
price
point
a
real
must
try
to
any
sour
lover
that
has
yet
to
try
this
overall
i
thought
it
was
great
drinkable
and
enjoyable
sour
i
definitely
recommend
o
this
is
my
second
time
having
a
gueuze
the
first
was
the
same
brew
about
3
years
ago
i
thought
it
was
too
much
then
now
its
delicious
easy
move
from
oud
bruin
and
flanders
red
to
this
delicious
o
i
am
thrown
off
by
a
little
offflavor
at
the
finish
i
am
not
counting
this
beer
out
because
it
has
some
really
amazing
tart
and
fruit
qualities
the
funk
seems
just
a
little
bit
off
its
good
but
would
like
to
get
rid
of
that
ironproteinblood
flavor
and
have
more
wet
hay
and
horseblanket
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
people
first
trying
gueuze
overall
could
use
more
balance
and
complexity
its
good
but
lindemans
has
better
offerings
d
and
o
really
enjoyed
this
beer
bout
time
i
got
to
giving
it
a
formal
review
o
this
is
a
really
nice
gueuze
again
its
not
as
blisteringly
sour
as
some
but
thats
not
a
bad
thing
the
balance
between
the
products
of
brettanomyces
and
acetobacterlactobacillus
is
superb
and
really
helps
the
drinkability
of
the
beer
would
i
like
it
to
be
a
bit
sourer
sure
but
i
really
dont
have
anything
to
complain
about
with
this
tasty
beer
o
this
was
fantastic
after
trying
some
newer
hyped
gueuzes
and
other
sours
lately
and
not
being
impressed
approaching
and
enjoying
this
older
example
was
a
thrill
i
had
an
epiphany
that
this
would
go
great
with
a
salty
cured
meat
and
i
was
right
had
a
sliver
of
proscuitto
di
parma
with
the
last
couple
sips
and
it
was
bangin
gotta
retry
a
bunch
of
gueuzes
now
and
put
this
one
into
perspective
this
is
truly
one
of
the
best
o
a
good
gueuze
besides
the
slightly
muted
taste
o
overall
a
very
nice
beer
and
an
affordable
gueuze
gets
bonus
points
in
my
book
id
definitely
buy
this
one
again
recommend
overall
i
cant
believe
its
taken
me
so
long
to
try
this
beer
certainly
much
different
than
most
of
the
other
beers
out
there
worth
a
try
when
in
the
mood
for
something
different
or
for
those
who
love
sours
so
not
sure
how
to
really
review
this
not
like
anything
i
have
tasted
pours
light
copper
with
white
foam
hazycloudy
sour
nose
powerful
sour
cherry
taste
very
much
so
some
apple
cider
notes
loads
of
flavor
and
taste
price
is
7
reasonable
very
enjoyable
and
complex
beer
not
for
the
sour
faint
at
heart
but
a
fun
and
dramatic
beer
to
try
and
enjoy
the
brewers
work
overall
what
a
really
complex
beer
style
there
is
a
lot
of
things
to
take
in
this
is
not
a
style
of
beer
that
is
for
someone
who
is
new
to
craft
beer
5
for
a
375ml
bottle
of
beer
great
price
to
get
your
feet
wet
with
this
style
of
beer
to
trial
and
see
if
you
like
the
style
overall
good
beer
overall
i
think
this
is
my
first
gueuze
while
its
far
from
my
favorite
style
i
can
say
i
appreciate
what
lindemans
has
done
here
i
wouldnt
mind
revisiting
this
one
at
some
point
in
the
future
primarily
loads
of
lemon
juice
apple
skin
and
vinegar
not
necessarily
my
favorite
style
of
sour
taste
instant
tartness
disippates
into
a
fruity
character
then
a
late
musty
finish
perhaps
a
little
on
the
mellowside
but
overall
a
very
nice
beer
which
is
far
too
easy
to
drink
a
beer
to
cellar
and
open
under
the
right
circumstances
d
an
excellent
brew
and
for
the
style
based
on
my
limited
knowledge
is
done
very
well
possibly
a
tad
sweet
for
a
traditional
gueuze
super
drinkable
with
a
nicely
balanced
profile
and
crisp
refreshing
feel
this
is
a
experience
and
something
you
should
seek
out
the
beer
pours
a
very
light
copper
color
bordering
on
light
orange
and
dehydrated
piss
yellow
a
fizzy
white
and
rocky
head
appears
and
quickly
fizzles
away
like
a
soda
leaving
a
light
scrim
and
ring
on
the
glass
the
beers
body
is
very
cloudy
with
haze
hiding
all
of
the
other
side
of
the
glass
from
view
carbonation
bubbles
are
a
constant
stream
running
up
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
on
the
nose
the
beer
smells
richly
funky
with
spicy
hay
light
fruit
leather
and
heavy
brett
smells
light
smells
of
cherry
are
also
present
in
the
sweet
fruit
leather
smell
the
beer
tastes
sweet
and
fruity
with
wonderful
barnyard
funk
in
the
beginning
of
the
taste
tart
flavors
are
light
and
controlled
but
lovely
and
lemon
notes
definitely
come
through
in
the
tart
taste
the
beer
begins
light
grass
and
hay
moving
into
barnyard
funk
and
light
fruit
leather
before
opening
into
lovely
lemon
characters
and
then
moving
into
more
barnyard
hay
and
the
supposed
horseblanket
flavor
the
aftertaste
is
grassy
with
nice
hay
notes
and
as
it
warms
there
are
also
notes
of
wheat
spice
and
light
banana
in
the
esters
on
the
mouth
the
beer
feels
sharp
with
carbonation
before
mellowing
into
a
medium
to
light
body
with
nice
tart
puckering
in
the
mouth
the
mouth
is
left
quite
clean
with
only
a
slight
scrim
of
saliva
overall
this
is
a
solid
gueuze
some
nice
barnyard
character
and
some
great
balance
between
the
tart
sweet
and
funky
flavors
this
beer
is
a
success
from
lindemans
with
some
great
lemon
characteristics
a
must
try
for
sour
fans
taste
is
quite
tart
at
first
with
the
sour
being
mostly
lactic
acid
and
some
minor
aetic
acid
tones
after
2
sips
the
beer
is
tart
but
never
goes
overboard
on
the
sour
no
aggresive
tartness
this
is
one
of
the
greatest
benefits
of
this
beer
it
is
tart
but
never
mouth
puckering
the
beer
nicely
balances
the
tartness
with
enough
body
there
are
nice
fruity
earthy
flavors
which
are
backed
up
by
a
subtle
wood
taste
the
beer
is
quite
drinkable
and
for
me
a
very
rounded
gueuze
o
my
first
gueze
i
am
a
bit
surprised
that
i
found
the
sourness
to
be
relatively
subdued
but
it
really
enhances
the
whole
experience
this
stuff
is
beyond
complex
i
will
definitely
be
exploring
the
style
further
and
will
pick
up
more
of
this
one
for
sure
o
this
is
a
pretty
damn
good
gueuze
and
i
am
glad
that
i
can
find
this
around
now
i
will
for
sure
stock
up
on
this
for
the
cellar
overall
i
liked
it
a
lot
different
than
other
lambics
id
love
to
try
more
guezes
not
much
needs
to
be
said
sit
down
with
one
of
these
and
learn
something
about
beer
and
about
yourself
o
what
a
fantastic
representation
of
the
gueuze
i
would
drink
this
again
and
again
b

nothing
worldclass
here
but
its

when
your

breweries

this

great
qualities
really
unpleasantly

like
a

not

much

mouthfeel
is
dry
such
as
sourness
cherries
horse

dry
and
fairly
complex
high
carbonation
skins
of
an
unripe
green
grape
sugary
or
off

and
obscure
for
the

what
it

lots

taste
is
more
substantial
with
a
somewhat
restrained
acidity

a
lingering
bitterness

real
thinking
mans
beer
d
i
am
unsure
if
i
would
drink
this
often
i
think
i
would
need
to
do
more
exploration
with
gueze
in
order
really
say
if
this
has
a
high
drinkability
factor
i
would
rate
this
based
on
the
expectation
of
a
gueze
taste
is
like
the
most
mouth
puckering
lemon
has
been
drained
of
all
its
moisture
and
shoved
into
your
mouth
quite
tasty
and
unusual
this
is
my
first
gueuze
as
you
can
probably
tell
very
dry
in
the
finish
with
a
long
linguering
lemonygrapey
aftertaste
suprising
and
good
it
pours
a
cloudy
straw
color
with
a
thick
white
head
it
has
the
distinctive
sour
aroma
that
is
present
in
lambics
and
other
sour
beers
the
flavor
is
very
tart
and
sour
and
gives
me
a
tingling
sensation
beneath
my
jaw
in
my
neck
the
flavor
is
dry
but
not
overly
so
it
leaves
a
dry
feeling
on
my
tongue
and
the
carbonation
creates
a
tingly
sensation
the
bottle
i
got
was
a
750ml
and
it
was
a
bit
much
for
this
beer
this
is
by
no
means
a
session
beer
a
solid
effort
a
real
lambic
bone
dry
no
relation
to
the
sweet
fruit
lambics
made
by
this
producer
the
flavor
profile
is
simple
and
pure
might
be
even
better
if
they
let
it
get
a
bit
dirtier
overall
not
as
sour
or
as
fruity
as
i
expected
but
then
i
am
not
familiar
with
the
style
likeable
but
a
bit
expensive
for
what
you
get
poured
hazy
pale
orange
with
a
dense
lumpy
head
smell
was
sweet
and
floral
with
a
hint
of
sourness
and
oak
taste
was
sour
apple
cider
dry
none
of
the
sweetness
here
astringent
and
mouthcoating
in
a
good
way
i
wish
this
beer
was
thicker
more
fullbodied
finish
was
dry
as
a
bone
and
felt
like
another
sip
very
good
but
oddly
frustrating
because
you
wish
it
were
just
a
little
bit
better
moderately
refreshing
and
drinkable
but
not
fantastic
how
is
this
a
cuvee
overall
this
is
a
great
example
of
gueze
it
is
so
much
better
than
the
more
commercial
fruit
lambics
from
lindemans
i
dont
think
i
could
drink
this
very
often
and
definitely
needed
others
to
help
me
finish
but
for
the
style
it
is
very
drinkable
it
was
enjoyed
by
several
who
only
rarely
drink
anything
other
than
bmc
i
continue
to
be
amazed
at
the
flavors
and
smells
produced
in
this
beer
style
and
will
seek
out
this
and
other
examples
as
i
get
the
chance
a
fantastic
gueuze
balanced
drinkable
and
full
of
flavour
drinkability
the
underlying
floral
tones
make
this
an
intriguing
taste
treat
even
for
someone
like
me
who
would
rarely
reach
for
a
sour
beer
flavor
similar
to
but
also
quite
different
from
the
other
gueuzes
i
have
tried
it
has
the
standard
sour
but
the
organic
earthy
farmyard
is
much
more
subtle
the
sour
is
easily
recognizable
as
green
apple
both
in
tartness
but
also
in
underlying
sugar
sweetness
a
really
good
jolly
rancher
you
know
i
like
this
one
as
a
very
good
representative
of
the
style
but
to
be
honest
its
a
little
too
candylike
to
be
my
favorite
lactic
its
sharp
up
front
but
finishes
like
a
sweet
lemonade
pear
raspberry
poured
out
a
clear
copper
color
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
that
dissipates
quickly
with
nice
lacing
the
aroma
is
strong
sour
and
tart
the
flavor
is
still
quite
tart
but
the
flavor
has
a
nice
fruity
apricot
roundness
with
hints
of
overripe
apple
and
a
bit
of
funk
in
the
finish
acidic
and
dry
smooth
and
drinkable
maybe
not
the
most
traditional
i
dont
really
know
its
good
though
and
i
like
that
d
very
unique
and
good
drinkability
by
far
one
of
the
most
interesting
beers
ive
ever
had
in
my
life
it
wasnt
really
better
or
worse
than
anything
ive
had
just
interesting
i
was
told
by
my
roommate
that
gueuze
is
also
called
belgian
champagne
i
agree
there
was
definatly
a
similar
taste
between
the
two
i
noted
a
very
cidery
vinigarish
scent
almost
no
hop
bitterness
as
a
result
of
aged
hops
being
used
i
would
drink
it
again
however
i
had
difficulty
drinking
the
entire
750ml
bottle
the
only
issue
i
had
was
i
thought
it
was
a
crown
cap
and
it
is
but
underneath
the
crown
is
a
cork
i
didnt
have
a
corkscrew
on
me
so
i
had
to
wait
to
actually
have
to
drink
the
beer
also
it
seemed
slightly
overcarbonated
im
not
sure
if
thats
the
style
but
by
compairson
to
other
ales
i
was
drinking
it
seemed
excessive
i
would
repeat
drinking
this
once
in
a
great
while
however
it
did
peak
my
interest
in
trying
other
types
of
gueuze
cheers
the
cuvée
rené
was
picked
up
in
a
750
ml
green
bomber
with
gold
neck
foil
and
a
crown
cap
which
when
popped
was
underlain
by
a
cork
after
opening
the
gueuze
lambic
was
poured
into
a
flute
glass
where
it
looked
deep
golden
with
a
two
finger
head
fed
by
champagne
like
constant
carbonation
taking
a
whiff
yielded
a
smell
with
a
mixture
of
sweet
and
sour
elements
but
little
of
the
farmhouse
smells
like
leather
or
sweat
found
in
other
gueuze
lambics
i
could
also
detect
a
marigold
like
floral
hop
presence
the
sip
confirmed
what
the
nose
had
revealed
this
was
quite
mild
for
an
unflavored
lambic
there
was
a
lot
of
sourness
of
course
but
it
was
a
clean
and
crisp
sourness
like
a
lemon
juice
poured
into
a
regular
beer
not
a
lot
of
funkiness
in
this
one
at
all
the
beer
was
crisp
and
light
in
the
mouth
and
was
very
easy
to
gobble
down
drier
than
the
lunar
seas
this
would
be
a
good
introduction
into
unblended
lambics
for
an
uninitiated
drinker
but
if
you
are
looking
for
a
ton
of
flavors
go
for
something
else
e
g
cantillon
instead
750
ml
corkedncapped
green
champagne
bottle
with
05
notched
on
the
label
it
pours
a
mildlyhazy
bright
orange
with
medium
carbonation
and
a
1
offwhite
head
that
reduces
to
almost
nothing
by
the
end
the
aroma
is
acidic
and
lightly
sweet
with
lemon
a
mild
earthymusty
character
and
some
phenols
that
are
a
tad
fruity
it
is
light
to
medium
on
the
palate
with
an
equal
finish
and
it
is
lightly
drying
with
a
taste
that
is
tart
bitter
sour
and
acidic
with
lemon
juice
and
phenols
it
almost
has
more
mouthpuckering
sensation
than
flavor
its
a
bit
difficult
to
drink
if
youre
not
in
the
mood
as
it
is
quite
sour
and
bitter
but
as
far
as
gueuze
goes
its
not
too
bad
very
tart
flavor
sour
a
hint
of
sweeteness
faintly
malty
steps
in
to
balance
things
up
but
this
beer
remains
dry
in
the
finish
unlike
rose
de
gambrinus
i
found
this
beer
quite
drinkable
its
tartness
was
not
so
unyeilding
this
beer
is
lightbodied
and
actually
fairly
refreshing
a
good
beer
to
celebrate
moving
into
a
new
place
pours
pale
orange
with
a
slight
haziness
large
foamy
head
champagne
like
that
dissipates
into
a
thin
head
lots
of
lacing
smells
of
sour
fruits
effervescence
taste
follows
with
an
interesting
blend
of
sour
fruits
basically
tastes
a
bit
like
rotting
citrus
without
the
stench
of
rot
i
havent
had
a
gueuze
yet
but
i
assume
this
is
what
they
are
supposed
to
taste
like
gives
an
ancient
type
of
feel
yet
is
elegant
as
well
excellent
representation
of
the
style
while
i
prefer
the
fruitier
lambic
notes
i
love
this
beer
it
is
so
flavorful
and
so
refreshing
i
will
always
have
this
or
others
like
it
on
hand
at
all
times
d
this
is
definitely
a
goto
gueuze
its
solid
across
the
board
and
easy
to
drink
if
youre
ready
to
drink
a
brew
of
this
style
full
bodied
and
extraordinarily
refreshing
a
fantastic
beer
for
the
summer
what
else
can
i
say
a
beautifully
crafted
ale
aged
to
near
perfection
stylistically
what
a
wonderful
introduction
to
browerij
lindemans
im
curious
to
try
a
more
recent
vintage
to
compare
very
thin
and
high
in
carbonation
thats
about
all
there
is
to
it
pretty
easy
drinking
despite
the
carbonation
and
the
funkiness
i
enjoyed
it
but
likely
not
something
ill
seek
out
in
the
future
ok
im
ending
this
review
before
this
beer
makes
me
sick
this
is
not
a
pleasant
belgian
sour
ale
but
hardly
drinkable
in
my
opinion
imagine
red
bull
without
any
sweetness
youre
there
taste
is
better
assertively
tart
with
some
sour
apple
and
lemon
rinds
acidic
vinegary
slightly
offputting
finish
lacking
in
character
and
complexity
compared
to
some
other
gueuzes
with
more
of
a
straightforward
tartness
but
far
better
than
lindemans
other
gueuze
mouthfeeldrinkability
cold
the
mouthfeel
is
nothing
short
of
amazing
the
champagnelike
bubbles
pop
and
foam
in
the
mouth
and
showcase
the
nuances
of
such
a
complex
beer
as
it
comes
to
temperature
it
becomes
less
carbonated
and
drinks
more
like
a
younger
geueze
a
few
months
from
being
drawn
from
the
barrel
overall
i
loved
this
beer
it
has
an
approachability
that
i
find
very
attractive
and
it
drinks
easily
by
itself
or
with
light
appetizers
pours
out
a
clear
apricot
with
a
thin
yet
frothy
head
very
little
carbonation
makes
this
look
almost
still
some
lacing
here
and
there
smell
is
of
musty
attics
oak
wheat
and
citrus
peel
i
pick
up
a
little
spiciness
along
with
an
acidic
tinge
married
with
some
faint
sugars
flavor
is
at
first
a
fairly
loud
sour
presence
which
quickly
backs
down
to
a
barely
sweet
middle
tastes
are
of
the
typical
musty
old
house
accompanied
by
lime
pith
and
tart
underripe
fruit
i
hoped
for
this
to
be
a
bit
more
ballstothewall
but
its
subdued
elegance
is
satisfying
enough
mouthfeel
is
light
slightly
bubbly
and
overall
drying
in
the
finish
but
could
be
drier
really
refreshing
and
complex
enough
to
be
highly
drinkable
but
the
faint
residual
sugars
need
to
go
and
this
needs
to
dry
up
not
something
id
drink
every
day
but
a
beer
i
enjoyed
enough
to
actively
try
more
from
the
style
very
interesting
geuze
should
i
say
a
premium
geuze
from
a
wellestablished
brewery
much
more
sour
and
tart
than
lindemanns
regular
products
but
closer
to
original
artisan
geuze
and
that
makes
it
worth
a
try
very
dry
aromatic
brew
with
majestic
crown
and
straightbetweentheeye
taste
pleasant
but
i
doubt
it
will
become
your
everyday
beer
clear
gold
topped
with
a
giant
puff
of
white
foam
a
solid
large
bubbled
coating
remains
tons
of
lace
dappled
all
over
the
goblet
racing
carbonation
bubbles
pleasantly
funky
farmy
aroma
moderate
tartness
with
strong
bleu
cheese
notes
wet
grass
green
apple
and
aluminum
the
flavor
starts
out
with
a
fizzy
explosion
of
carbonation
very
airy
and
light
feeling
tartness
stronger
than
id
anticipated
from
a
lindemanns
brew
takes
over
the
palate
with
a
green
apple
flair
funky
cheese
moldy
notes
in
the
finish
with
freshly
mown
grass
and
receding
fruity
sourness
some
citrusy
notes
in
the
aftertaste
lemonlime
finishing
the
beer
off
with
a
fresh
sparkling
feel
chalky
and
very
dry
the
acidity
is
a
bit
more
restrained
than
say
a
cantillon
which
makes
for
supreme
drinkability
really
really
nice
im
not
sure
what
i
expected
but
this
was
a
rare
treat
not
as
over
the
top
as
i
imagined
but
750
ml
goes
pretty
quickly
even
when
savoring
evey
sip
notes
i
liked
it
but
it
was
just
ok
mouthfeel
is
light
and
wispy
crisp
thin
yet
satisfying
not
a
real
complex
gueuze
softer
pretty
basic
very
userfriendly
not
as
musty
as
it
should
be
not
even
a
lot
of
sediment
in
the
bottle
but
good
nonetheless
750
ml
bottle
very
effervescent
almost
champagnelike
thin
persistent
head
with
a
creamy
appearance
right
from
the
pour
smells
sharp
almost
astringent
but
has
notes
of
apricot
mouthfeel
is
thinner
than
the
fruit
lambics
but
creamier
than
say
a
pils
taste
is
sharp
at
first
then
mellows
into
a
pleasant
sour
note
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
all
in
all
very
enjoyable
definitely
a
different
experience
than
the
sweet
gueuze
beers
drinkability
a
pefect
light
drinking
summer
beer
heck
pair
this
with
burgers
and
fries
or
something
like
that
a
lambic
that
is
very
sour
and
tart
compared
to
even
the
funkiest
saisons
a
beer
for
all
seasons
ive
had
this
2002
edition
since
2004
when
i
purchased
it
in
minneapolis
mn
why
did
i
wait
to
drink
it
i
wasnt
cellaring
it
i
just
didnt
drink
it
i
guess
i
figured
it
wouldnt
be
this
good
now
i
am
happy
i
can
buy
more
in
kansas
city
id
be
happy
to
drink
this
again
on
a
hot
summers
day
or
with
a
salad
or
with
bleu
cheese
or
all
by
itself
recommended
yellowgold
suprisingly
clear
aroma
shows
floral
elements
semitartness
and
sweetness
on
the
palate
the
initial
threat
of
tartness
gievs
way
to
a
mild
sweetness
before
that
tart
element
returns
rapidly
the
flavors
are
bright
and
satisfying
overall
this
contributes
to
a
pleasant
sensation
cuvee
rene
is
refreshing
and
perfectly
quaffable
the
flavor
is
fruity
and
tart
again
with
the
grape
skins
and
a
bit
of
sour
apple
it
is
lightmedium
in
body
and
a
bit
acidic
nice
brew
by
far
not
my
style
of
beer
so
my
review
may
bang
it
a
bit
more
than
it
deserves
pours
an
orangeish
amber
into
the
glass
minimal
head
and
minimal

sweet
fruity
aroma
astringent
melony
taste
probably
the
best
gueuze
i
have
had
to
date
but
still
far
from
what
i
would
buy
perhaps
my
tastes
are
changing
yet
again
i
guess
we
shall
see
taste
carbonation
is
livid
the
acidity
level
was
nice
and
reminded
me
of
the
time
i
crunched
on
a
piece
of
raw
wild
rhubarb
back
when
i
was
a
kid
the
funk
level
was
relatively
low
and
the
aftertaste
was
a
bit
short
still
a
nice
gueuze
that
i
can
relatively
easily
relative
meaning
a
2hour
drive
into
a
foreign
country
this
is
miles
away
from
the
fruity
crap
this
company
puts
out
definitely
worth
sampling
and
worth
sitting
on
for
a
good
long
while
if
you
can
restrain
yourself
amazing
drinkabilitynotes
a
solid
credible
example
of
the
most
royal
of
beers
lambics
are
an
acquired
taste
to
be
sure
but
a
taste
worth
acquiring
if
a
beer
style
can
be
said
to
be
transcendent
then
it
is
the
lambic
style
orange
and
foamy
out
of
the
bottle
not
untypical
for
the
style
tart
and
dry
nose
some
vinegar
slightly
complex
gueze
but
not
terribly
so
only
average
tastes
of
lambic
funk
tart
and
dry
with
some
acetic
qualities
scrubbing
bubbles
in
the
mouth
fairly
light
body
cloudy
caramel
with
a
white
head
that
produced
lots
of
lacing
aromas
of
sour
fruit
cidery
apples
and
yeast
the
flavour
mirrors
the
aroma
with
a
tart
finish
theres
a
bit
of
citrus
here
as
well
everything
melds
very
nicely
medium
to
light
bodied
moderate
carbonation
and
quite
dry
definitely
a
fine
beer
thanks
kevin
i
poured
this
750ml
corked
and
capped
bottle
into
a
champagne
flute
it
formed
a
2
white
head
over
the
clear
orangeygolden
brew
foamy
head
lasts
well
and
lacing
is
nice
aroma
is
a
piercing
tartness
with
a
woodysoil
tinge
to
it
this
one
doesnt
have
the
balance
of
the
straight
lindemans
gueuze
its
flavor
seems
to
focus
on
the
tartness
which
overwhelms
any
of
the
more
subtle
notes
i
drank
part
of
it
with
a
lime
to
cut
the
overwhelming
tartness
i
dont
have
a
very
sophisticated
lambic
gueuze
pallet
and
this
may
be
my
shortcoming
but
i
did
not
like
this
particular
gueuze
the
taste
is
well
balanced
between
the
malt
the
citric
sourness
and
slight
funk
not
as
shocking
to
the
palate
as
cantillon
lively
mouthfeel
from
the
carbonation
and
insanely
drinkable
maybe
a
good
introduction
to
the
style
for
the
uninitiated
drinkability
of
the
few
gueuzes
i
have
had
this
one
ranks
right
up
there
with
the
best
of
them
tasty
and
hit
the
spot
my
first
of
this
style
this
poured
a
subdued
golden
hue
with
mild
head
and
some
lacing
smell
was
very
tart
sour
and
sweet
very
intense
aroma
taste
was
very
sour
in
front
which
puckers
the
lips
and
finishes
with
some
mild
fruity
notes
for
me
the
sourness
just
dominates
the
experience
i
guess
ill
just
admit
that
being
a
freshmen
ba
my
palate
probably
just
isnt
devoloped
enough
to
appreciate
this
style
yet
i
plowed
through
a
tulips
worth
of
this
one
but
i
couldt
get
anyone
i
was
with
to
even
try
more
than
one
sip
i
can
see
the
value
in
this
beer
however
so
i
will
definitely
be
revisiting
it
after
perhaps
a
year
or
so
no
freshness
date
carved
nor
fresh
by
so
unknown
vintage
but
guess
young
nice
presentatation
with
forever
lasting
white
head
and
a
nice
golden
beercollor
with
not
much
haze
nose
is
delicate
giving
good
fresh
horse
sweet
dry
fresh
hay
delicatly
dosed
sourness
and
overal
very
fresh
but
landlike
caracter
taste
is
good
also
having
a
well
dosed
but
not
overdone
sourness
grapefruit
like
good
dryness
horse
sweaty
rough
leather
taste
with
tard
bitterness
yes
this
is
a
fine
example
of
a
geuze
and
easy
accesable
good
and
for
geuze
quiet
high
dosed
carbonisation
make
it
together
with
the
plesant
taste
to
great
mouthfeel
and
a
well
drinkable
real
geuze
wonder
how
these
2
1994s
in
my
cellar
are
doing
this
is
a
good
gueze
but
i
think
cantillon
and
others
are
certainly
more
deep
funky
and
complex
nonetheless
i
can
see
this
being
a
bit
more
widely
appealing
just
because
its
not
as
funky
and
sour
as
some
this
would
make
an
amazing
apperetifdry
bubbly
and
not
too
overwhelming
just
right
to
whet
an
appetite
very
champagnelike
if
you
like
really
dry
wine
sour
green
apples
iced
tea
with
no
sugar
and
extra
lemon
or
ever
thought
of
stuffing
a
whole
lime
in
your
corona
you
might
want
to
give
this
a
try
not
an
everyday
beer
a
nice
belgian
sour
beer
smells
tart
and
moderately
sour
slight
fruity
aromas
behind
and
a
little
yeasty
looks
mostly
clear
yellow
with
a
slight
wheat
haze
to
it
tastes
have
a
good
blend
of
barley
and
wheat
malt
flavors
and
textures
with
a
complex
citrus
sourness
and
acidity
very
efforvescent
to
the
toung
pleasantly
creamy
and
tart
not
astringent
just
nicely
tart
finish
is
dry
and
champaign
like
aftertaste
is
moderately
sweet
and
tart
lingers
for
quite
a
while
no
vintage
on
the
bottle
so
i
think
its
the
new
packaging
which
means
its
probably
pretty
fresh
appearance
is
great
clear
copper
with
a
very
nice
white
head
that
wont
go
away
in
my
champagne
glass
smell
is
very
musty
a
tiny
bit
of
a
rotten
smell
in
there
and
you
can
tell
its
very
acidic
taste
is
also
very
acidic
and
sour
definitely
mouthpuckering
it
has
a
very
clean
finish
compared
to
the
other
lambics
ive
tried
which
leaves
me
a
little
disappointed
as
i
prefer
the
tartness
to
linger
on
the
palate
the
flavor
seems
a
bit
muted
and
doesnt
quite
have
that
zing
that
ive
come
to
love
its
just
a
tad
too
watery
for
my
tastes
as
well
extremely
refreshing
though
and
something
i
could
drink
all
night
long
perhaps
with
some
age
this
will
develop
dthis
is
very
well
blended
the
barnyard
flavors
add
great
complexity
but
are
not
inyourface
shocking
the
tart
sour
notes
are
very
nice
and
really
add
another
nice
layer
to
this
beer
much
more
character
and
flavor
than
any
sparkling
wine
this
beer
was
consumed
on
the
night
of
the
birth
of
my
daughter
which
was
on
july
19
2005
opinion
i
think
that
this
is
about
as
close
to
a
perfect
beer
as
any
this
is
really
the
only
beer
that
i
have
tried
from
lindemans
that
i
would
consider
saying
that
about
sure
their
flavored
lambics
are
good
and
worldclass
in
their
own
right
but
they
are
far
too
sweet
for
my
palate
this
one
has
some
surprising
sweetness
in
it
but
it
barely
even
coexists
with
the
wholesome
funky
goodness
of
the
wild
fermentation
it
is
a
bit
hard
for
me
to
believe
that
this
is
what
the
lindemans
beers
taste
like
before
they
add
all
of
those
syrups
in
if
you
like
this
brew
id
try
the
normal
gueuze
too
bottle
poured
a
dirty
yellowish
color
beer
with
a
huge
foamy
head
with
excellent
retention
aroma
of
funky
barnyard
wild
sourness
and
belgian
yeast
taste
is
sour
as
expected
with
some
faint
sweetness
and
some
funky
yeast
acidity
is
well
balance
which
i
appreciate
and
body
is
quite
full
overall
this
is
a
nice
gueuze
remove
from
the
sweet
fruit
lambic
that
they
also
produce
750
ml
bottle
corked
and
capped
and
foil
sealed
some
dating
on
cap
but
in
code
interesting
tartness
is
king
in
this
dominates
the
feel
but
in
a
gentle
delicious
way
very
sophisticated
stuff
and
past
the
powerful
tartness
especially
approachable
man
i
love
the
shit
out
of
gueuze
very
nice
beer
thanks
to
derek
for
sharing
a
glass
of
this
world
class
gooze
pours
an
earthy
orange
color
with
a
tall
whitetan
head
lots
of
clingy
lace
on
the
glass
there
is
a
little
nose
some
sharp
yeasty
and
citrus
aromas
the
taste
wow
immediately
a
sharp
bitter
unripe
citrus
fruits
and
a
crisp
strong
sour
flavor
when
this
was
described
as
sour
i
guessed
that
it
would
be
a
sluggish
sourness
this
is
not
the
case
the
sourness
is
very
neat
and
clean
an
excellent
addition
to
the
mouthfeel
this
beer
would
make
a
great
aperitif
for
a
wide
range
of
foods
steak
and
potatoes
or
seafood
dinner
a
deepish
shade
of
ginger
brown
hazy
in
appearance
good
pop
to
the
cork
but
the
head
settles
quickly
to
a
skim
in
an
open
chalice
minimal
lace
in
the
first
glass
better
in
the
second
aroma
with
a
bit
of
yeastiness
slightly
tart
but
with
lots
of
pie
apples
in
it
body
of
this
one
is
decent
carbonation
lighter
than
some
but
its
there
lightly
challenging
flavors
tart
with
unripe
fruit
a
sense
of
woodiness
and
rose
petals
not
overpowering
to
start
actually
pretty
drinkable
for
style
just
at
the
end
the
mouthfeel
flattens
and
that
kick
in
the
butt
moresourthangrapefruit
seeds
character
makes
itself
known
not
a
showdown
gueuze
but
good
in
its
pleasantly
aged
way
drinkability
well
i
had
no
trouble
drinking
the
750ml
in
a
couple
hours
though
it
did
leave
me
with
a
mild
headache
nevertheless
it
was
an
enjoyable
brew
that
went
well
with
some
sea
salt
and
pepper
crackers
and
gouda
while
i
consider
the
straight
lindemans
gueuze
a
beginners
gueuze
this
is
what
i
would
call
an
intermediate
one
nowhere
close
to
a
cantillon
but
much
closer
than
the
former
i
thoroughly
thoroughly
enjoy
this
beer
poured
out
from
the
bottle
to
a
chimay
glass
a
clear
and
golden
with
just
a
bit
of
a
thick
and
cloudy
head
that
swirled
across
beautifully
wonderfully
dark
wine
cellary
scents
very
vineous
with
tons
of
fresh
pipe
tobacco
scents
difficult
for
me
to
describe
the
body
on
this
one
maybe
medium
give
it
a
swirl
and
you
can
get
some
carb
but
not
too
much
not
obnoxious
amounts
there
is
good
feel
to
it
it
has
a
good
fit
wow
this
is
good
stuff
this
is
what
i
want
when
i
order
a
gueuze
you
feel
the
tartness
coming
at
you
before
it
hits
your
tongue
yum
lemon
juice
and
tart
granny
smith
apples
deeply
wonderfully
vineous
and
semisour
this
is
just
amazingly
good
and
goes
down
so
easily
i
was
so
happy
to
see
this
one
in
the
dawsons
fridge
happiness
thanks
to
kmpitz2
for
sharing
this
bottle
of
1994
pours
an
orange
color
with
a
tall
head
that
dies
off
quickly
and
leaves
some
lacing
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
very
tart
way
sour
and
funky
the
flavor
is
exactly
the
same
as
the
nose
hits
you
with
a
huge
tartsour
punch
at
first
then
continues
to
be
sour
acid
abound
not
my
style
i
dont
care
for
the
puckering
sour
its
very
well
made
but
not
my
style
pours
a
very
pale
copper
color
and
makes
a
huge
creamy
white
head
smells
like
a
musty
old
barnyard
with
some
hints
of
citrus
flavor
is
very
tart
with
lemon
and
grapefruit
very
asstringent
and
light
to
medium
bodied
with
a
very
dry
acidic
finish
a
quite
drinkable
and
tasty
brew
vintage
1994
this
is
my
new
years
beer
this
one
pours
a
slightly
oranged
yellow
color
with
a
3
finger
head
that
falls
to
a
quarter
inch
over
top
of
the
beer
the
nose
is
really
sour
lots
of
tart
and
bits
of
lemony
acid
but
just
sour
is
all
about
what
it
is
the
flavor
on
this
beer
is
just
awesome
a
huge
tart
and
sour
wtih
some
lemon
and
acidy
that
almost
puckers
your
mouth
wow
i
think
this
beer
is
awesome
full
of
funk
and
all
that
goodness
the
feel
is
nice
light
moderate
but
right
where
it
should
be
for
the
tart
and
sour
very
much
an
aquired
taste
but
i
love
it
for
a
hugely
sour
beer
this
is
really
drinkable
i
am
going
out
to
buy
another
bottle
of
this
vintage
tomorrow
hot
damn
easily
the
best
beer
of
the
lindemans
line
this
is
a
fine
example
of
a
gueuze
one
of
the
most
refreshing
yet
also
a
beer
worth
savoring
1994
bottle
cellared
by
a
friend
of
mine
in
excellent
conditons
the
beer
pours
a
glowing
orange
with
a
little
head
the
aroma
is
of
dry
white
grapes
or
the
cork
from
a
merlot
bottle
the
flavor
kicks
you
in
the
mouth
i
am
not
a
fan
of
very
sour
things
so
this
was
not
too
appealing
to
me
sour
sour
sour
very
citrusy
and
sour
there
are
also
some
woody
notes
perhaps
oak
green
apple
peel
pear
and
white
grape
juice
flavors
all
fill
the
glass
this
beer
overall
is
excellently
complex
but
i
just
dont
like
the
intense
sour
flavor
pours
a
deep
gold
with
a
champagnelike
bone
white
head
lots
of
tiny
bubbles
sour
notes
dominate
but
a
slight
sweet
peach
aroma
comes
through
on
the
nose
mild
berry
tones
noticable
lots
of
sour
black
cherry
dominates
the
palate
dry
somewhat
short
finish
amazing
flavor
upfront
mild
mustiness
in
the
back
dry
crisp
effervescent
mouthfeel
quite
refreshing
one
of
the
few
beers
i
could
mistake
for
a
champagne
my
wife
even
thought
it
tasted
like
champagne
only
more
sour
a
very
good
beer
i
will
try
this
one
many
times
over
try
this
one
i
did
not
care
for
this
beer
it
poured
a
muddled
peach
color
with
a
large
white
foamy
head
the
aromas
were
all
sour
young
grape
and
herbal
the
only
thing
i
could
taste
was
sour
and
tart
so
much
so
that
the
back
of
my
throat
and
gums
felt
like
an
explosion
of
some
sour
apple
candy
not
even
a
hint
of
the
tasty
earthy
barnyard
belgian
yeasts
i
have
come
to
admire
and
savor
the
mouthfeel
was
overwhelmed
by
the
desire
to
get
this
beer
outof
my
mouth
perhaps
i
simply
do
not
appreciate
this
style
but
if
my
description
accurately
describes
what
this
beer
is
supposed
to
taste
like
i
will
not
purchase
any
more
gueuze
beers
how
does
one
control
the
wild
yeasts
to
this
degree

aftertaste
i
had
to
even
consider
drinking
this
with
mates
and
so
i
did
1994
bottling
corked
and
capped
cork
was
moist
at
the
bottom
even
after
being
upright
for
a
significant
period
of
time
which
is
a
good
sign
poured
a
deep
golden
with
bronze
color
with
a
pillowy
white
head
into
a
traditional
belgian
hexagonal
tumbler
intricate
lacing
left
behind
as
the
head
subsides
currant
skin
aroma
herbal
woody
and
some
musty
barnyard
funk
with
an
apparent
acidity
that
is
affirmed
with
the
first
sip
its
subtly
sweet
followed
with
a
fruity
acidity
like
sour
green
apple
and
lime
some
of
your
more
traditional
lambic
funk
is
pretty
low
maybe
due
to
the
fact
that
its
10
years
old
and
had
a
significant
time
to
mellow
and
meld
flavors
but
still
a
major
role
in
this
beer
it
overall
seems
to
be
a
little
bit
sweeter
that
other
blended
lambics
ive
tried
but
a
good
gueuze
nonetheless
very
spritzy
and
wellcarbonated
affirming
and
dry
on
the
palate
quenching
like
quinine
in
tonic
water
and
at
5
i
could
drink
this
like
it
was
tonic
water
i
had
a
gueze
years
ago
in
belgian
and
remember
liking
it
just
because
it
was
a
bit
different
and
i
liked
the
tradition
of
spontaneous
fermentation
back
to
the
roots
of
beer
so
to
speak
my
havent
we
come
a
long
way
looking
forward
to
trying
more
of
this
style
sorry
lindemans
just
wasnt
impressed
the
beer
as
it
separates
from
the
750ml
green
bottle
set
in
the
glass
a
beclouded
golden
amber
color
with
a
magisterial
bright
white
head
that
is
creamy
in
texture
and
as
it
erodes
the
lace
forms
a
solid
and
somewhat
thick
sheet
to
meld
with
the
glass
nose
has
a
sweet
and
sour
front
with
a
citrus
crispness
fresh
and
clean
to
the
senses
start
is
also
somewhat
sweet
with
the
top
light
to
moderate
in
its
feel
finish
is
stinging
in
its
acidity
the
hops
pleasantly
mild
and
the
aftertaste
tart
and
very
dry
a
great
beer
to
have
here
in
the
desert
especially
now
as
its
in
the
110s
and
the
humidity
quite
high
the
best
gueuze
i
have
ever
stumbled
upon
if
lindemans
filtered
and
sweetened
lambics
provide
the
bucks
for
this
lambic
then
i
am
all
for
it
middle
aged
women
keep
buying
the
framboise
this
lambic
is
a
bit
tame
compared
to
the
other
two
ive
tried
but
it
still
has
the
funk
the
nose
was
quite
earthy
but
not
so
bretty
i
e
horsey
barnyard
etc
definately
some
but
i
just
got
more
of
a
dirt
kind
of
smell
none
of
the
real
sharpness
but
very
rich
full
round
type
scents
pretty
sour
beer
but
not
overwhelmingly
so
nice
sour
fruityness
and
very
very
dry
still
a
touch
of
residual
sweetness
but
perhaps
what
little
there
is
is
just
super
obvious
because
the
beer
is
so
dry
otherwise
i
like
this
one
pretty
good
but
i
couldnt
drink
more
than
a
glass
or
two
per
sitting
i
am
not
that
big
of
a
fan
of
these
kinds
of
beer
this
one
is
a
good
representative
though
had
a
great
opportunity
to
try
the
1998
version
thanks
to
the
awesome
brian
at

he
picked
my
sample
up
at
the
brewerythanks

the
beer
pours
a
nice
orange
honey
color
and
serves
up
a
good
creamy
beige
head
the
lace
is
moderate
to
good
aromas
are
nicely
sour
with
plenty
of
horseblanket
and
barnyard
funk
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
refreshing
and
very
dry
flavors
are
sour
cream
likevery
tart
while
at
the
same
time
mellow
and
elegant
this
is
a
complex
gueze
that
has
taken
on
a
very
winelike
persona
with
age
layers
of
flavor
unfold
as
the
beer
finishes
damn
i
love
this
style
of
beer
and
thank
brian
for
the
rare
treat

certainly
one
of
the
best
lambics
available
in

the

is

a
few
of
these
poured
a
crystal
clear
orange
with
tons
of
little
bubbles
racing
to
the
top
thin
but
extremely
bubbly
white
head
that
continually
gave
little
explosions
quite
beautiful
smell
was
quite
acidic
and
musty
but
in
a
good
way
the
taste
was
very
tarty
and
slightly
sour
sharp
twangs
of
fruit
continually
came
at
me
the
main
flavor
that
i
got
reminded
me
of
a
granny
smith
apple
yeast
flavor
was
definitely
present
and
it
provided
a
base
to
this
beer
along
with
a
very
dry
finish
sourness
increased
the
more
i
drank
i
couldnt
imagine
drinking
this
fresh
considering
how
acidic
and
sharp
the
flavors
were
now
definitely
adviseable
to
pair
this
with
some
cheese
and
crackers
jarlsberg
and
onion
toasteds
for
me
very
good
choice
for
a
special
occasions
but
i
couldnt
drink
this
too
often
thin
bodied
dry
and
again
tart
not
something
i
would
turn
to
everyday
but
an
excellent
beer
paid
8
99
for
the
750ml
97
vintage
this
is
a
deliciously
intense
brew
well
worth
the
price
every
now
and
then
and
never
ever
boring
pours
a
medium
orange
with
a
light
golded
tint
with
a
grear
fluffy
head
that
just
leaves
incredable
lacingaroma
is
ctrius
and
some
soapy
aromas
in
there
as
well
taste
a
little
subdued
for
the
flavor
wich
is
fine
with
mestill
rather
sour
and
dry
some
real
ripe
green
apple
flavors
in
theredid
i
pick
up
some
nutiness
in
there
ass
wellalthough
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
this
beer
deserves
good
marks
well
made
and
not
overpowering
as
i
pop
the
cork
an
immediate
enticing
sour
aroma
springs
forth
from
the
bottle
it
pours
a
cloudy
orangish
red
color
and
has
an
off
white
head
it
is
definitely
carbonated
but
not
superly
so
the
aroma
is
sour
with
citrus
notes
a
bit
of
musty
character
as
well
this
beer
is
very
dry
and
sour
throughout
there
is
a
definite
brett
character
as
well
reminds
me
of
a
mustyleathery
something
or
other
though
the
brett
character
is
somewhat
subdued
compared
to
other
i
have
sampled
this
beer
is
not
as
complex
as
some
of
the
other
traditional
gueuzes
but
it
is
proof
that
lindemans
can
make
something
other
than
alcopop
if
they
wanted
to
2001
vintage
750ml
bottle
poured
into
a
tulipstyle
glass
it
pours
a
deep
orangebrown
color
with
two
fingers
of
head
there
is
minimal
lacing
on
this
one
the
smell
is
a
little
musty
with
some
white
grapes
and
lots
of
acidity
the
taste
starts
very
sour
very
very
sour
with
a
bit
of
a
dry
sherry
finish
there
is
a
slight
metallic
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
thick
and
strong
due
to
the
high
acid
content
i
was
not
able
to
stomach
too
much
of
this
one
maybe
ill
like
lindemans
sweeter
gueuze
better
in
conclusion
i
tasted
nothing
to
sneer
at
but
nothing
with
which
to
declare
the
end
of
all
gueuzes
overall
impression
this
might
be
a
good
starter
geuze
for
someone
who
has
never
tried
it
sort
of
ease
them
into
it
however
of
the
ones
we
tasted
that
evening
the
mort
subite
oude
geuze
seemed
a
much
more
flavorful
and
balanced
starter
geuze
quite
drinkable
for
a
gueuze
and
very
refreshing
one
of
belgiums
better
gueuze
lambics
seek
it
out
especially
older
vintages
if
they
can
be
found
if
you
thought
lindemans
lambics
were
all
sweet
fruit
bombs
think
again
this
is
the
real
deal
2001
bottling
presented
in
a
gueuze
tumbler
this
really
is
a
beautiful
beer
light
golden
with
a
very
slight
haze
and
a
big
foamy
white
head
that
settles
quickly
to
a
good
level
for
drinking
leaves
a
nice
lace
the
aroma
is
very
mellow
and
complex
barnyard
and
medicinal
aromas
mixed
with
a
very
tart
and
like
a
nondescript
fruit
with
no
sweetness
whatsoever
very
interesting
and
nice
on
the
palate
its
massive
acidic
sourness
packed
into
a
light
body
that
feeling
that
your
teeth
are
being
eaten
away
like
when
you
bite
into
a
lemon
vinous
in
the
front
increasingly
tart
as
it
moves
to
the
back
more
of
that
nondescript
fruitiness
is
abound
even
vegetablelike
character
is
showing
up
a
little
old
damp
and
decaying
wood
character
here
and
there
with
cork
character
showing
up
and
adding
some
great
complexity
near
the
end
finish
is
as
dry
as
an
arizona
riverbed
this
is
a
great
gueuze
and
i
cant
wait
for
more
however
as
complex
as
it
is
already
it
really
would
benefit
with
more
aging
to
bring
out
more
im
going
to
try
to
get
some
1994
bottles
soon
then
perhaps
my
ratings
will
be
even
higher
this
is
an
amazing
beer
and
an
amazing
style
definitely
best
served
at
cellar
temp
to
bring
out
all
of
its
subtleties
my
first
lambic
and
i
had
no
real
idea
what
to
expect
but
i
had
the
good
fortune
of
drinking
this
unique
brew
along
with
a
magnificant
french
chicken
dinner
the
lambic
poured
a
slightly
cloudy
copper
color
with
a
modest
white
froth
the
smell
was
more
like
wine
really
than
beer
very
fruity
and
the
taste
was
shall
i
say
unusual
tart
lemony
cranberry
with
just
a
hint
of
grassy
malt
the
initial
tang
gives
way
quickly
but
the
effervescense
remains
i
would
not
want
to
drink
a
whole
lot
of
this
stuffcouldnt
afford
to
anywaybut
what
a
complement
to
a
fine
dinner
better
than
champagne
or
wine
as
far
as
im
concerned
this
is
a
near
perfect
beer
but
not
for
every
beer
drinker
i
am
sure
lambics
are
something
of
an
esoteric
mystery
to
me
but
regardless
i
find
them
a
style
of
infinite
discovery
lindemans
poured
a
opaque
golden
color
with
a
fairly
descent
sized
head
and
plenty
of
small
lace
up
and
down
smell
was
full
of
cranberry
grassy
aroma
and
a
fair
bit
of
co2
escaping
into
my
nose
the
taste
was
crisp
to
the
point
of
mouth
puckering
there
was
tons
of
tart
lemon
bitterness
seltzer
like
carbonation
dusty
as
an
attic
and
a
dry
assertive
finish
went
perfectly
with
chicken
and
shallots
cooked
in
a
white
wine
cream
sauce
the
1994
vintage
was
a
bit
more
complex
than
the
2001
sample
i
had
before
this
beer
is
beautiful
in
its
clarity
a
light
copper
hue
a
somewhat
fizzy
head
to
begin
with
turns
into
more
of
a
creamy
and
lush
looking
coating
in
a
minute
aroma
is
lovely
lemongrass
chalk
vinegar
must
and
tart
raspberry
this
is
one
mouth
puckering
lambic
the
pucker
quality
really
comes
on
after
you
swallow
as
for
other
characteristics
id
say
this
has
quite
a
bit
of
acidity
to
it
vinegar
like
sour
apple
like
and
like
lemon
juice
there
seems
to
be
some
grape
like
attributes
as
well
maybe
some
grape
skin
tart
raspberry
comes
to
mind
as
well
although
this
beer
is
not
fruity
there
is
a
dryness
present
in
this
beer
throughout
the
tartness
in
this
beer
literally
coats
your
whole
mouth
exactly
what
a
good
lambic
should
do
still
havent
found
a
gueuze
as
good
as
this
one
aging
is
key
though
younger
bottles
have
been
nearly
as
good
the
one
reviewed
above
peach
orange
hue
with
a
light
haze
covered
by
an
off
white
persistent
creamy
head
that
trails
wisps
of
lace
waft
of
tart
woefully
upripe
berry
hits
the
nose
at
first
then
is
superceded
by
lactic
and
acetic
tartness
derived
from
mixed
acid
enteric
fermentation
as
the
beer
breathes
pungent
yet
rounding
notes
of
wet
horse
and
mild
woody
oak
surface
mellow
yeast
must
and
hints
of
cheesy
aged
hop
add
additional
depth
in
aroma
just
a
touch
shy
of
complete
aromawise
although
assertively
tart
allaround
in
flavor
an
unripe
yet
bright
raspberrylike
note
permeates
throughout
a
pronounced
combination
of
sharp
acetic
tartness
and
mellower
lactic
acid
along
with
subtle
chalk
overshadow
any
trace
of
residual
sweetness
lending
a
bone
dry
feel
notes
of
hay
and
cork
emerge
mid
palate
along
with
earthy
must
both
from
the
suspended
primary
yeast
and
wild
brettanomyces
character
subtle
grainy
hints
of
wheat
struggle
to
emerge
through
the
dominant
tartness
although
bone
dry
in
overall
profile
the
mouthfeel
retains
an
elegant
crisp
smoothness
and
is
far
from
thin
finishes
slightly
astringent
with
lingering
grapeskin
tannin
tinged
tartness
almost
a
beautiful
beer
the
trace
roughness
precludes
greatness
but
that
may
change
with
a
few
years
of
cellaring
delicious
bottled
2001
this
is
for
a
man
who
loves
a
good
sour
ale
one
of
the
elite
beers
simply
fabulous
ive
had
this
beer
3
or
4
times
now
and
this
is
the
first
time
i
havent
consumed
the
whole
750
ml
bottle
myself
and
this
is
only
because
this
is
the
first
time
ive
lived
with
another
beer
snob
my
fiancee
great
beer
in
every
respect
pours
a
pale
golden
color
with
a
nice
somewhat
rockychunky
yet
fizzy
white
head
that
retains
nicely
musty
attic
and
basement
with
some
slightly
tart
fruitiness
as
well
with
a
bit
of
a
grassyhay
undertone
excellently
sour
and
tart
with
lip
puckering
goodness
that
is
very
intense
plenty
of
farmish
type
tastes
combine
with
the
great
tartness
to
make
this
an
outstanding
brew
great
crisp
and
dry
mouthfeel
with
a
relatively
light
medium
body
i
could
drink
this
every
day
of
the
week
and
i
probably
would
if
i
lived
in
belgium
notes
simple
but
has
depth
flavourful
but
not
boisterous
this
brew
shows
little
aging
flaws
at
all
and
perhaps
could
see
another
decade
or
two
without
turning
as
long
as
the
cork
holds
up
ill
be
seeking
more
bottles
asap
this
would
be
a
good
brew
to
break
a
newbie
to
the
world
of
lambics
very
interesting
not
an
everyday
beer
but
more
of
a
special
treat
when
looking
for
something
different
very
drinkable
not
as
much
of
a
trip
as
some
gueuzes
but
this
is
a
winner
my
faith
in
the
2002
was
restored
its
just
too
young
if
you
prefer
what
age
can
do
to
this
beer
as
i
do
witness
the
1994
it
was
like
drinking
molten
lemons
that
had
been
painstakingly
spiced
with
thousands
of
sumatran
botanicals
certainly
a
5
5
5
5
5
man
this
is
bloody
good
i
never
understand
how
lindemans
can
churn
out
their
normal
filtered
product
at
the
detriment
to
this
traditional
gueuze
an
expensive
purchase
a
treat
really
for
me
but
well
worth
it
more
culture
than
a
petri
dish
a
truly
artisanal
beer
and
up
with
the
best
of
the
gueuze
heavyearthy
stinky
barnyard
nose
also
a
bit
of
wood
citrus
and
grassyness
insanely
sour
almost
too
sour
very
mouth
puckering
acidity
lots
of
citrus
veryu
dry
yeast
flavours
earthy
even
refrshing
insanely
good
stay
away
from
the
sweetened
lindemans
stuff
and
stick
to
this
real
question
is
what
did
the
brewer
intend
if
brewer
wanted
traditional
no
success
he
heshe
wanted
a
sweet
and
somewhat
refreshing
relatively
low
alcohol
pleasant
drink
then
success
you
be
the
judge
id
drink
it
cold
and
as
a
refreshing
sweet
juice
drink
happy
to
finish
the
brew
so
i
can
pour
out
the
remainder
and
cleanse
my
palate
with
a
good
beer
its
not
horrible
but
its
not
the
best
example
of
a
guezue
either
o
the
aroma
was
nice
but
the
taste
not
so
much
terrible
balance
bad
example
of
style
drinkability
enjoyable
in
a
different
way
but
i
wouldnt
want
more
than
one
of
these
a
year
definitely
worth
a
try
on
the
100
point
scale
id
give
it
a
75
c
average
i
think
this
is
worth
a
try
and
a
beer
to
add
your
holiday
season
to
drink
list
ogueuzes
range
from
gross
to
beautiful
this
is
sadly
on
the
lower
end
of
that
spectrum
its
fresh
too
so
i
know
its
not
a
spoiled
bottle
it
just
has
too
many
gross
flavors
and
the
mouthfeel
is
just
terrible
d
for
a
gueuze
this
really
is
a
mess
for
a
fruit
beer
its
still
not
really
even
that
good
sorry
to
say
this
is
an
epic
fail
and
do
not
waste
your
money
on
it
whoever
thought
this
was
a
gueuze
needs
to
get
hisher
brain
checked
d
whoever
dubbed
this
brew
a
gueuze
should
be
shot
this
is
easily
the
most
poorly
executed
brew
i
have
come
across
since
cave
creek
chile
beer
avoid
at
all
cost
this
isnt
the
worst
thing
in
the
world
its
just
not
brewed
with
you
in
mind
still
doesnt
make
it
any
good
cheers
chapeau
winter
gueuze
by
the
label
pours
a
clear
orangebrown
with
absolutely
zero
head
smell
the
nose
is
very
offputting
yes
there
are
some
light
fruity
notes
ala
flavored
lambic
but
no
sour
gueuze
notes
and
the
overwhelming
character
is
something
really
nasty
that
i
cant
quite
put
my
finger
on
not
quite
tobacco
not
quite
wet
newspaper
not
quite
zoo
shit
but
just
bad
taste
tobacco
raspberry
sweet
with
just
a
little
cider
vinegar
acidic
character
doesnt
seem
to
be
in

much
else
to
say
about
this
other
than
the
flavor
is
just
completely
offputting
as
is
any
beer
with
a
strong
bile
component
there
is
really
not
much
more
to
say
about
this
it
is
not
as
horrific
as
i
had
feared
but
it
certainly
has
some
really
weird
herbal
tree
like
notes
to
it
pours
orange
brown
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
very
odd
and
not
too
good
this
beer
smells
exactly
like
frenchs
yellow
mustard
you
also
get
a
little
cherry
or
strawberry
the
flavor
is
similar
only
sweeter
picture
a
sweet
mustard
with
a
little
cherry
thrown
in
thin
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
i
couldnt
work
up
much
of
a
head
but
there
was
a
lightly
hazy
white
head
floating
atop
the
beer
nose
was
sour
cherry
kriek
color
was
a
fairly
clear
deep
amber
mouthfeel
was
somewhat
thin
taste
was
somewhat
tart
but
overall
not
much
on
which
to
report
finish
was
really
sweet
i
have
had
much
better
from
chapeau
pours
a
tobacco
and
rust
amber
that
was
still
clear
very
quick
head
but
pretty
good
bubbling
the
aroma
has
some
definite
funkiness
makes
me
think
of
a
kriek
along
with
cocktail
shrimp
and
cocktail
sauce
the
taste
has
a
funky
and
middle
of
th
road
kriek
flavor
like
some
old
cherries
just
a
day
away
from
being
unedable
utlets
not
forget
the
cocktail
sauce
and
shrimp
flavor
at
the
end
the
palate
is
tart
but
fruity
and
weirdly
funky
glad
i
tried
this
beer
but
will
never
buy
again
d
i
dont
really
know
much
about
the
style
this
was
the
first
one
that
ive
had
i
think
but
i
kind
enjoyed
this
one
a
little
sweet
for
me
but
still
good
o
the
smelltaste
discrepancy
is
amazing
all
nasty
cork
in
the
nose
but
a
fruity
cherry
taste
enjoyed
it
this
brew
pours
up
a
nice
red
amber
color
with
a
small
off
white
head
the
nose
is
cherries
candy
sugar
light
sourness
the
taste
is
sour
cherries
a
lil
cork
subtle
oak
medium
bodied
low
carbo
i
like
chapeau
chapeau
winter
gueuze
like
the
rest
of
the
chapeau
lambics
is
overpriced
oversweet
beer
that
is
too
offbeat
to
be
considered
a
firstrate
panty
stripper
better
to
stick
with
the
lindemans
beers
even
though
they
cost
a
pretty
penny
too
on
a
positive
note
theyre
still
cheaper
than
dinner
and
a
movie
d
you
would
not
want
much
of
this
one
to
be
honest
its
downright
strange
drinkability
legendarily
bad
a
what
were
they
thinking
kind
of
beer
edit
im
drinking
another
bottle
this
labeled
winter
gueuze
and
im
liking
it
better
so
there
i
have
a
hard
time
reviewing
these
types
of
beers
they
are
pretty
decent
for
what
they
are
but
i
have
a
hard
time
reviewing
them
alongside
beer
because
to
me
they
are
so
different
than
beer
they
almost
should
not
even
be
in
the
same
category
overall
this
is
a
pretty
decent
brew
that
is
highly
refreshing
the
main
detracting
quality
from
this
beer
is
its
high
amount
of
sweetness
that
can
be
cloying
this
really
is
not
that
horrible
as
a
drink
but
it
is
about
the
last
thing
that
comes
to
mind
when
i
think
of
a
beer
maltwheat
and
hops
nothing
to
recommend
it
unless
youre
already
a
fan
of
the
chapeau
beers
nose
contains
a
muted
sourness
which
comes
across
a
little
bit
salty
as
well
taste
and
body
are
thin
and
sweet
like
a
sugar
water
solution
with
fruity
flavors
of
grape
mango
and
apple
just
a
hint
of
sourness
carbonation
is
very
dampened
which
i
thought
did
not
go
well
with
the
thin
body
and
taste
i
would
think
if
youre
going
sweet
at
least
go
spritzy
imperceptible
bitterness
overall
utterly
strangesweet
and
berry
laden
not
bad
but
a
gueuze
it
is
not
i
imagine
the
regular
gueuze
afficianados
who
like
the
taste
of
sour
rotting
hay
and
horse
piss
would
not
like
this
as
it
is
fruity
and
tasty
from
the
first
notes
from
2011
375
ml
bottlewaagstuk
tastes
really
sweet
so
sweet
even
that
labelling
this
a
faro
would
be
a
much
better
indication
of
how
it
tastes
especially
since
this
seems
to
have
nothing
in
the
way
of
a
gueuze
taste
is
that
of
candy
sugar
lots
lots
of
it
with
juice
chlorine
which
is
not
something
that
i
wish
to
taste
pour
is
a
pale
yellow
with
a
thin
white
bubbly
head
the
nose
has
a
faint
note
of
dust
and
some
light
apple
juice
maybe
some
golden
fruit
taste
is
the
same
almost
no
funk
apple
juice
golden
grapes
a
bit
syrupy
and
fairly
sour
medium
to
full
body
syrupy
and
coating
a
bit
viscous
with
a
dry
finish
d
this
beer
brings
shame
to
the
name
of
gueuze
stay
away
from
this
while
i
could
drink
this
if
someone
made
me
it
is
definitely
the
worst
travesty
i
have
ever
experienced
from
a
bottle
labeled
gueuze
though
i
must
admit
that
i
have
a
bottle
of
chapeau
christmas
gueuze
with
added
flavor
what
ever
that
means
still
coming
up
these
fake
de
troch
lambics
are
made
that
much
more
interesting
by
the
fact
that
they
can
make
a
good
traditional
lambic
when
they
put
there
mind
to
it
i
really
hope
they
make
more
of
the
traditional
products
as
i
have
been
able
to
try
some
very
good
examples
from
this
brewery
pours
cloudy
copper
almost
still
by
design
or
is
my
bottle
too
young
in
the
bottle
carbonation
issues
aside
the
beer
is
nice
nose
is
a
blend
of
pineapple
and
elderflower
with
some
citrus
and
mild
funkiness
flavor
is
orange
apple
strawberry
with
a
puckerinducing
sour
finish
certainly
one
of
the
most
sour
and
fruitiest
gueuzes
ive
had
if
you
had
blindfolded
me
i
would
have
guessed
a
framboise
or
kriek
lambic
bottle
poured
a
dirty
beigeorangey
color
lambic
with
a
small
bubbly
head
with
no
retention
and
no
lacing
aroma
of
funk
is
more
dominant
then
expected
with
some
light
lingering
sweet
notes
taste
is
also
more
funky
and
tart
then
expected
though
sweet
notes
are
not
too
interesting
body
is
full
with
limited
filtration
and
low
carbonation
more
interesting
then
i
would
have
expected
though
lacking
some
green
apples
notes
and
some
acidity
this
is
only
my
second
attempt
at
a
gueuze
lambic
not
bad
although
miles
behind
the
first
definitely
drinkable
but
there
was
a
distinct
funkiness
that
make
it
taste
more
like
a
faro
something
old
or
rotten
underneath
the
obvious
tartness
and
sweetness
but
not
overpowering
definitely
drinkable
although
if
another
lambic
was
available
id
probably
choose
it
notes
dont
buy
beer
from
embassy
in
roseville
unless
you
want
this
experience
holy
shit
this
is
the
fifth
and
last
time
im
gonna
try
and
support
their
business
when
they
clearly
dont
care
about
their
stockcustomers
overall
impression
it
grew
on
me
not
the
lambic
to
end
all
lambics
but
not
a
bad
beer
well
not
much
good
to
say
about
this
brew
a
listless
dull
and
altogether
boring
example
of
the
style
avoid
pours
a
semi
hazy
golden
color
but
where
the
hell
is
the
head
almost
no
carbonation
not
many
bubbles
in
this
beer
either
aroma
is
of
splenda
and
white
grape
juice
not
my
cup
of
tea
taste
is
light
almost
watery
with
no
dominating
characteristics
except
for
the
saccarinlike
flavor
im
getting
and
a
little
apple
in
there
tartness
and
vinegar
come
out
a
bit
as
it
warms
but
im
really
searching
here
and
cant
find
much
finish
goes
away
quickly
and
i
forget
about
this
beer
seconds
after
the
swallow
this
reminds
me
of
apple
juice
might
be
good
for
someone
who
has
never
tried
a
lambic
and
wouldnt
be
ready
for
the
sourtartacidic
qualities
most
lambics
offer
otherwise
not
recommended
taste
big
effervescence
somewhat
tart
but
really
watery
and
no
particular
flavour
at
all
it
was
like
lemon
metamucil
with
alkaseltzer
ive
actually
tasted
a
lambic
worse
than
this
but
ive
tasted
so
many
better
that
i
would
pass
on
this
one
without
a
second
thought
the
worst
beer
i
had
during
my
whole
trip
to
belgium
even
jupiler
is
better
than
this
sweetish
soft
sourness
soft
tartness
very
smooth
and
light
no
sharp
bite
it
just
fades
away
bit
of
and
oak
barrell
character
strange
and
interesting
worth
a
go
but
wont
have
again
notes
from
2013
sampled
one
of
these
again
from
1999
probably
overrated
this
one
a
bit
but
didnt
take
proper
notes
so
i
will
leave
the
score
for
what
it
is
still
not
a
bad
one
esp
compared
to
the
new
stuff
so
full
of
character
it
was
a
bit
overwhelming
and
a
good
beer
to
split
would
gladly
enjoy
again
this
is
really
my
type
of
gueuze
bracing
sourness
extremely
funky
so
complex
yet
so
light
and
spritzy
this
beer
captures
quite
well
in
its
character
why
i
love
lambic
so
much
surprisingly
this
blows
the
3
fonteinen
that
a
friend
is
drinking
out
of
the
water
d
a
very
nice
beer
probably
more
in
the
american
wild
tradition
its
got
some
of
the
acetic
character
of
lost
abbeys
wild
beers
and
a
bit
less
complexity
than
the
best
gueuzes
still
highly
drinkable
and
well
done
its
a
shame
ballast
point
doesnt
or
cant
make
more
of
this
stuff
on
tap
at
stone
sour
fest
pours
a
hazy
tangerinemarigold
color
with
almost
no
carbonation
nose
is
of
lemon
verbena
and
mild
funk
with
an
amazing
cedar
wood
quality
taste
is
a
smack
punch
this
is
what
i
wanted
tart
and
somewhat
cheesy
with
a
puckering
zest
mouthfeel
is
sour
and
dry
overall
my
favorite
of
the
day
a
wonderful
beer
d
one
of
my
favorite
beers
on
the
day
and
one
that
ive
wanted
to
try
for
quite
some
time
very
enjoyable
though
i
would
have
preferred
some
more
tartness
not
overly
carbonated
but
a
decent
mouthfeel
dnice
representation
of
the
style
perfectly
complex
i
would
encourage
sour
lovers
to
get
proof
that
ballast
point
excels
at
more
than
just
hop
bombs
if
only
i
could
have
it
everywhere
in
my
mouth
right
now
just
the
right
amount
of
tartness
sourness
and
funk
with
a
surprisingly
refreshing
touch
this
is
one
of
the
best
americanmade
guezes
that
ive
run
across
it
was
a
pleasure
to
be
able
to
try
this
standard
hazy
amber
gueuze
color
it
was
poured
with
very
little
head
though
swirling
brings
to
life
a
shortlived
white
cap
the
aroma
is
musty
and
tart
very
sharp
with
stinging
lactic
sourness
and
some
light
vinegar
this
reminds
me
quite
a
bit
of
russian
rivers
beatification
only
slightly
funky
this
is
heavy
on
the
lacto
and
pedio
and
fairly
light
on
the
brett
theres
a
bit
of
stonefruit
buried
beneath
the
sourness
the
taste
is
sour
stonefruit
parmesan
cheese
funkiness
and
mouthwatering
lemonlike
acidity
filling
and
intense
it
finishes
woody
tannic
and
fruity
with
bracing
acidity
that
you
can
feel
burning
holes
in
your
innards
as
it
goes
down
simply
an
awesome
beer
id
love
to
try
this
again
the
beer
is
light
bodied
with
a
high
moderate
level
of
carbonation
outstanding
stuff
i
cannot
say
enough
about
it
drinkability
i
love
sours
and
could
drink
this
beer
alone
all
night
my
girlfriend
had
about
four
of
these
and
wanted
more
but
they
ran
out
great
job
bp
now
just
bottle
it
the
line
for
this
beer
was
incrediblly
long
consistently
and
hopefully
the
people
from
ballast
point
recognized
this
and
will
bottle
this
stuff
just
like
carlos
said
in
his
review
and
at
the
festival
this
was
the
best
americanmade
gueuze
i
have
ever
tasted
without
question
definitely
the
big
surprise
of
the
day
for
me
cannot
wait
to
drink
again
highly
recommended
dry
and
crisp
finish
i
kept
going
back
for
this
one
and
would
have
easily
finished
all
my
tasters
with
this
beer
straight
up
the
best
american
made
gueuze
i
have
had
thus
far
hazy
golden
colour
smells
better
than
it
tastes
coriander
apples
white
fruit
too
sweet
for
gueuze
low
sourness
pretty
bad
a
perfect
lambic
a
sweet
beer
with
the
right
touch
of
sour
to
make
it
very
drinkable
enjoyed
this
beer
very
much
o
ok
not
great
gueuze
quite
a
bit
of
sweetness
for
a
gueuze
has
only
a
mild
sourness
still
pretty
enjoyable
and
recommended
for
those
trying
to
get
into
sours
nice
aroma
fruity
and
tart
with
tones
of
hay
and
horse
sweet
moderately
tart
with
stockyard
characteristics
and
fruit
tones
by
far
no
hops
at
all
light
not
very
fizzy
and
wellbalanced
beer
overall
this
beer
isnt
terrible
overall
but
its
an
awful
gueuze
im
never
going
to
have
it
again
crisp
refreshing
and
a
really
easy
drinker
overall
a
good
brew
lots
and
lots
of
carbonation
which
could
explain
the
lack
if
head
and
lace
golden
and
a
bit
hazy
muted
aroma
sour
cherries
and
dog
curious
flavor
nice
start
sour
fruit
chardonnay
very
subtle
bitterness
an
odd
iodine
flavor
on
the
finish
glassware
issue
light
body
all
i
could
think
of
was
the
carbonation
near
overwhelming
o
one
of
my
first
gueuzes
enjoyable
but
nothing
amazing
medium
body
and
carbonation
overall
a
pretty
dumbed
down
gueuze
not
bad
just
nothing
really
special
overall
interesting
but
a
big
swing
and
a
miss
for
me
the
aroma
was
a
bit
lighter
then
i
was
expecting
but
still
tremendously
good
rich
nose
of
tart
apple
vinegar
sour
grapes
and
a
touch
of
wet
hay
as
it
warms
it
comes
across
with
a
light
wheat
or
herbal
like
quality
and
just
the
tiniest
amount
of
spice
prickling
the
nose
the
flavor
was
more
of
the
same
rich
notes
of
sour
and
biting
vinegar
flavor
coming
across
on
it
right
away
light
grapes
and
even
a
touch
of
wheat
coming
through
mid
palate
especially
as
it
starts
to
warm
o
simple
geuze
containing
the
wild
tart
factor
for
sure
this
one
seemed
a
bit
more
toward
the
sour
side
overall
the
beer
had
an
interesting
taste
and
and
a
nice
look
in
the
glass
it
may
not
be
as
exciting
as
some
of
the
other
beers
in
its
categorystyle
but
im
still
happy
i
tried
it
i
dont
think
id
buy
it
again
however
beer
is
medium
in
body
but
overall
really
light
on
the
palate
it
is
mild
all
around
not
really
a
gueuze
ultimately
but
its
not
horrid
easy
drinking
lightish
mildly
sour
kind
of
sweet
beer
d
i
am
surprised
this
has
such
a
low
score
i
thought
it
was
a
pretty
decent
gueze
and
would
def
drink
it
again
that
said
it
wasnt
crazy
good
and
i
think
i
prefer
their
fond
traditional
orangebrown
strong
smell
of
bananas
without
this
fruit
in
the
composition
of
the
gueuze
mouth
but
a
bit
too
watery
despite
a
strange
smell
of
bananas
a
bit
like
the
fruit
sauces
because
they
are
feeling
a
little
fiber
and
it
is
still
quite
soft
in
the
mouth
the
finish
is
subtly
but
quite
low
acid
flavors
little
sugar
which
is
already
better
than
nothing
but
the
body
is
too
low
compared
to
other
lambic
interesting
but
not
as
much
as
id
hope
from
this
style
i
believe
this
is
the
first
gueuze
ive
ever
had
though
ive
had
other
lambics
purchased
at
the
control
board
in
ontario
pours
a
pale
orange
colour
with
big
white
head
nice
retention
and
lacing
covers
about
14
of
the
glass
smells
of
apples
lemon
quite
tart
flavour
is
both
sour
and
sweet
nice
carbonation
level
this
reminds
me
of
the
sour
patch
kids
candy
that
i
used
to
eat
while
i
was
younger
it
tastes
nice
but
not
something
that
i
would
drink
everyday
overall
not
bad
the
metallic
taste
imo
really
hurt
this
one
each
sip
was
just
okay
wont
purchase
again
unfortunately
i
had
seen
the
reviews
before
i
tried
this
but
had
high
hopes
when
i
poured
it
although
surprisingly
clear
it
had
a
nice
head
atop
the
deep
golden
liquid
lacing
was
substantial
too
the
aroma
off
the
beer
was
tart
though
dominated
by
apple
aromas
sadly
the
taste
was
just
apples
with
not
nearly
enough
tartness
at
first
although
over
time
it
was
getting
sour
a
nice
bite
with
moderate
carbonation
but
not
a
beer
i
would
seek
out
to
drink
ever
again
nothing
really
exciting
here
it
might
be
smooth
but
the
excessive
sweetness
means
i
would
probably
switch
to
something
else
after
a
glass
or
two
this
is
worse
than
the
faro
to
me
bc
it
really
shouldnt
be
sweet
judged
as
a
faro
i
like
this
better
than
the
three
faros
that
i
just
tried
but
as
a
gueuze
this
simply
sucks
it
is
certainly
not
bad
or
objectionable
tasting
just
not
a
gueuze
tha
beer
was
light
gold
colored
with
a
thin
white
foam
that
dissipated
quickly
to
a
film
the
aroma
was
slightly
tart
more
like
an
apple
than
like
vinegar
the
sweetness
in
the
taste
was
also
more
indicative
of
apples
than
anything
else
very
pleasant
and
easy
to
drink
with
a
minimum
of
funky
sour
bite
a
great
gateway
to
the
style
not
gonna
be
everyones
favorite
but
i
liked
it
maybe
it
was
the
atmosphere
gueuze
is
a
bit
of
an
acquired
taste
bad
gueuze
such
as
this
goes
far
beyond
that
counterfeits
like
st
louis
gueuze
prove
that
brewing
is
not
a
medium
in
which
one
can
lie
successfully
industry
and
machines
are
no
substitute
for
human
touch
and
the
sum
of
hundreds
of
years
of
tried
and
tested
development
nurturing
and
tradition
nice
strongly
carbonated
mouthfeel
a
very
refreshing
and
drinkable
beer
my
first
gueuze
and
somewhat
impressed
overall
a
nicely
subdued
version
of
the
style
compared
to
others
that
ive
tried
recently
my
teeth
are
not
tingling
after
every
sip
unfortunately
im
a
little
sensitive
to
the
taste
of
artificial
sweeteners
so
the
acesulfamepotassium
leaves
a
slightly
off
taste
for
me
in
the
crisp
finish
375ml

a

dots

and
barnyard
aromas
suggest
the
use
of

i
also
get
some

taste
is
sweet

citrus
and
a
lemony
sour
tartness
that
quickly
fades
away
more
funk
woody
herbal
and
hints
of
vinegar
in
the
aftertaste
not
as
sugary
as
i
thought
it
would
be
which
is
a
good
thing
lightbodied
mouthfeel
is
spritzy
spiced
and
astringent
decent
enough
but
i
dont
actually
enjoy
it
meh
this
being
my
first
gueuze
i
didnt
know
what
to
expect
but
this
left
me
satisfied
if
the
sweetness
of
this
derived
from
real
fruits
rather
than
artifical
sweeteners
i
think
it
would
be
a
completely
different
beer
at
a
slightly
higher
price
tag
for
a
somewhat
average
beer
i
wont
be
buying
this
too
often
but
this
one
does
leave
me
looking
forward
to
my
next
gueuze
drinkable
if
too
sweet
but
certainly
nothing
i
will
ever
come
back
to
and
not
a
great
first
impression
of
the
style
since
this
is
my
first
gueuze
or
first
brew
labeled
as
such
im
not
sure
if
st
louis
is
doing
the
style
justice
its
a
drinkable
beer
certainly
a
slow
sipper
yet
not
one
im
liable
to
pick
up
in
the
future
might
cellar
a
bottle
for
a
while
see
what
it
does
do
to
the
sourness
i
couldnt
drink
much
more
then
a
glass
or
two
but
this
was
a
very
tasty
gueuze
d
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
not
the
best
sour
ale
i
have
had
but
surely
a
worthy
one
could
make
a
great
session
beer
d
this
is
a
solid
gueuze
not
as
complex
for
sure
as
others
ive
had
but
the
lactic
acid
is
there
and
its
not
a
brew
thats
been
dumbed
down
for
the
masses
traditional
flavours
i
just
expect
more
funk
and
complexity
in
this
style
this
was
almost
berliner
weisse
like
in
its
characteristics
picked
up
a
small
bottle
at
a
brussels
beer
shop
to
drink
in
the
hotel
pours
into
a
small
wine
glass
a
ripe
gold
color
with
a
shin
off
white
head
that
quickly
dissolves
to
thin
lace
aroma
contains
tart
almost
candy
like
apple
notes
hints
of
vinegar
and
a
generic
belgian
pale
fruity
yeastiness
the
taste
is
mildly
tart
and
sour
on
the
front
of
the
palate
but
quickly
turns
sweet
and
almost
sugary
with
apple
flavors
and
pale
malts
making
up
the
bulk
of
the
flavor
hops
seem
to
be
absent
entirely
body
is
crisp
and
smooth
with
moderate
carbonation
easy
to
drink
but
not
my
favorite
of
the
style
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
filling
at
all
mild
kick
very
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
really
nice
sour
belgian
beer
that
isnt
as
harsh
as
others
of
its
kind
and
is
worth
drinking
for
a
long
time
overall
a
fun
beer
to
try
with
a
heightened
experience
since
it
was
a
gift
flown
over
from
the
source
thank
you
roger
taste
sickly
sweet
oh
my
god
the
aroma
was
a
trick
its
like
apple
juice
without
the
depth
of
flavour
the
sour
note
is
there
hanging
in
the
background
and
a
bit
of
a
brett
aftertaste
but
its
like
the
added
a
bunch
of
sugar
to
mask
what
could
have
been
an
alright
sour
beer
mouthfeel
is
light
and
airy
with
a
soft
carbonation
it
would
be
refreshing
is
the
beer
wasnt
so
dreadful
in
the
flavour
department
no
way
would
i
want
another
pours
a
golden
apple
colour
one
finger
white

that
quickly
dissipates
nose
sweet
apple

very
slight

taste
very

flat

ugly
grainy
musky
thick
syrupy
mess
a
beer
you
would
give
someone
if
you
really
didnt
enjoy
hanging
out
with
said
person
a
total
drain
pour
the
only
gueze
available
in
manitoba
and
what
a
gem
it
is
figures
thanks
mlcc
for
another
piss
poor
choice
keep
them
coming
a
white
head
with
some
lacing
that
stuck
around
the
colour
was
a
bit
more
amber
than
apple
juice
fairly
clear
liquid
carbonation
in
evidence
slow
and
lazy
i
happened
to
have
this
right
after
a
session
in
the
hot
tub
and
the
fruity
nose
was
quite
welcome
lemon
lime
fruit
zest
and
all
the
taste
was
similarly
citrus
fruit
a
bit
snappy
with
a
sour
dough
bread
feel
some
green
apples
presence
not
sugary
at
all
thanks
for
that
overall
i
found
this
refreshing
and
uplifting
although
not
overly
complicated
not
bad
for
the
first
day
of
june
after
spending
time
in
the
garden
and
unwinding
in
the
tub
a
for
the
masses
lambic
that
would
be
useful
to
open
friends
eyes
to
what
beer
can
be
not
your
wild
ale
sourheads
dream
beer
though
i
tried
this
beer
on
march
3
2008
after
purchasing
from
my
local
lcbo
outlet
the
beer
poured
a
translucent
orangyred
colour
with
a
generous
white
bubbly
head
which
quickly
disappeared
the
aroma
was
faintly
sour
apples
not
as
strong
as
others
have
suggested
the
mouthfeel
was
mediumbodied
almost
creamy
and
highly
carbonated
the
flavour
wasnt
all
that
sweet
very
reminiscent
of
the
crabapples
i
used
to
eat
as
a
child
on
the
way
to
school
not
a
lot
of
malty
flavours
or
hoppy
tones
in
this
one
d
i
could
probably
have
a
few
of
these
if
they
were
very
cold
i
do
believe
that
the
sweetness
would
start
to
bother
me
very
quickly
otherwise
tastes
blends
with
the
nose
fruits
sugars
a
bit
of
funk
and
more
than
enough
carbonation
a
decent
drinker
but
i
cant
see
myself
buying
this
again
jh
d
not
great
but
easy
drinking
i
would
drink
it
again
but
i
wouldnt
buy
it
its
drinkable
not
challenging
i
agree
with
others
a
good
introduction
to
the
style
for
nongeeks
i
dont
loath
it
like
some
no
reason
to
discount
this
as
a
serious
lambic
blend
but
it
is
best
suited
to
turning
on
your
wife
or
friends
to
this
style
drinkability
une
gueuez
correcte
mais
sans
plus
je
préfére
la
st
louis
gueuze
fond
tradition
however
i
definitely
wouldnt
recommend
paying
the
import
price
for
it
if
youre
a
real
lambichead
and
purists
will
hate
it
citrusy
sweetness
and
some
slight
grapefruit
sour
light
and
sharply
carbonated
perhaps
a
bit
too
light
finishes
with
a
cleansing
tartness
but
slightly
empty
and
weak
enjoyable
but
forgettable
smooth
geuze
its
the
corn
and
sugar
making
it
an
easy
drink
after
a
lot
of
work
popular
with
my
mates
and
a
nudge
to
transition
them
away
from
macros
not
a
quality
geuze
but
i
have
had
worse
and
less
drinkable
light
body
the
cork
was
a
good
quality
its
not
bad
id
drink
it
again
but
i
doubt
ill
be
seeking
it
out
its
ok
dog
reddish
gold
papery
aromas
smell
hospitally
alongside
typical
gueuze
rancid
apple
aromas
bizzarre
there
is
an
assertive
neutrality
to
the
flavor
metal
neutral
and
sweet
alcohol
apply
fruit
and
chalk
crowd
the
perimeter
globs
of
incoherent
gas
point
to
nothing
watery
and

why
did
they
waste
natural
cork
on
this
bottle
if
bland
tasteless
beer
is

a

poured
a
medium
clear
amber
color
ale
with
a
huge
white
foamy
head
with
good
retention
faint
barnyard
aroma
can
be
detected
as
well
as
subtle
sourness
taste
is
sweeter
then
regular
gueuze
with
some
sweetness
but
no
acidity
complexity
is
quite
low
and
i
guess
this
would
be
more
of
a
beginner
gueuze
then
anything
else
very
lightly
sour
and
pretty
sweet
i
can
hardly
imagine
this
to
be
a
gueuze
as
sweet
and
friendly
as
this
is
whereas
gueuze
normally
tastes
like
how
a
unclean
barnyard
smells
this
is
bright
and
cheerful
zesty
and
clean
very
enjoyable
well
for
me
this
was
always
going
to
be
too
sweet
to
be
any
good
theres
some
light
earthy
notes
with
some
tartness
and
light
sourness
but
the
sweetness
i
think
dominates
this
i
think
this
needs
more
stink
and
more
sour
and
has
to
be
a
lot
dryer
an
average
mainstream
gueuze
had
on
tap
a
few
days
prior
it
had
an
interesting
slightly
tart
and
salty
flavor
without
becoming
cloying
very
refreshing
pour
is
hazed
deep
orangish
amber
with
a
good
bit
of
white
head
nose
is
burnt
sulfur
almost
like
the
cooked
ash
of
a
firework
taste
is
pretty
rough
overly
sweet
and
sugar
with
tons
of
burnt
sufur
and
burnt
out
sparkler
just
bad
dont
drink
has
a
lemony
tart
nose
it
pours
hazy
gold
with
a
head
that
looks
like
the
foam
on
the
sea
shore
after
a
big
storm
its
big
fluffy
and
persistent
the
palate
is
a
balance
of
lemony
tartness
and
light
sweetness
it
is
somewhat
unexciting
but
perhaps
a
good
starter
for
those
looking
for
a
less
intimidating
gueuze
overall
quite
an
enjoyable
gueuze
pure
yeast
ester
flavors
left
unmolested
by
hops
or
excessive
malt
i
will
repeat
this
one
not
the
best
ive
in
a
sour
i
feel
like
the
sour
really
over
powers
the
flavors
good
overall
not
the
best
gueuze
but
very
nice
just
wanted
more
funk
to
it
just
okay
nothing
wrong
with
this
beer
but
it
lacks
complexity
taste
is
very
strongly
sour
almost
vinegar
like
hints
of
citrus
i
would
not
buy
it
again
but
i
am
glad
i
tried
it
not
blended
well
stale
bread
harsh
on
tap
at
beachwood

funk
cider
vinegar
and
some
green

taste
is
briefly
sweet
citrus
quickly
replaced
by
tart
vinegar
and
lemon
sourness
the
funkiness
is
there
too
but
less
than
the
nose
indicated
medium
body
thin
texture
active
carbonation
crisp
drying
puckering
finish
o
always
interesting
to
try
a
beer
with
a
bit
of
age
but
i
think
i
would
have
enjoyed
this
better
fresher
and
will
try
to
find
a
younger
bottle
if
you
like
sour
this
definitely
delivers
and
is
worth
a
try
final
grade

a
b
as
someone
with
very
little
experience
in
the
field
of
lambics
all
i
can
really
offer
here
is
a
subjective
opinion
i
find
st
louis
gueuze
fond
tradition
to
be
pretty
good
value
for
the
price
but
it
still
doesnt
strike
me
as
the
best
that
this
style
has
to
offer
recommended
as
an
accessible
affordable
introduction
to
the
world
of
sours
ill
grab
another
bottle
and
hold
onto
it
for
a
few
years
to
see
if
there
are
any
new
developments
but
for
now
ill
just
call
this
a
pretty
good
lambic
and
leave
it
at
that
not
the
best
representation
of
the
style
but
a
good
buy
when
you
have
limited
other
options
poured

dark
golden
color
with
one
finger
of

is
strong
a
musky
aroma
sour
apple
white
grape
lemon
and
oak
seem
to
be
the
most
obvious
but
a
little

the
taste
is
a
wonderful

lemon

very

of

the
style
the

an
added
bite
overall
a
very
nice
lambic
with
good

good
price
for
the
style
too
some
serious
offflavor
from
the

almost
it
doesnt
suck
but
its
offputting
on

some
rubber
and
plastic
in
taste
that
is
really
unfortunate
smells
like
and
really
should
be
a
decent
budget
gueuze
but
the
off

make
it
marginally

a

was
more
than
impressed
with
this
offering
especially
at
around
4
a
bottle
overall
i
loved
this
beer
very
refreshing
would
get
it
again
in
a
heartbeat
overall
small
sips
recommended
and
you
may
even
want
to
split
the
small
bottle
with
a
friend
this
is
intensely
tart
as
per
the
style
lemony
simple
and
refreshing

want
to
jump
into
the
style
heres
your
beer
overall
i
got
a
lot
of
traditional
gueuze
notes
but
many
lacked
the
depth
and
impact
to
really
make
this
a
memorable
brew
the
dryness
is
there
but
doesnt
consume
the
drinker
the
tartness
is
there
but
sort
of
gets
lost
in
the
woody
notes
a
fun
brew
but
the
elite
ones
are
a
few
notches
ahead
pours
out
a
light
orange
with
a
thin
bone
white
head
smells
of
wheat
crackery
grain
bretty
funk
and
typical
sweaty
lambic
taste
is
a
bit
sweeter
than
some
other
traditional
geuzes
ive
had
i
get
some
fruitiness
from
the
yeast
very
sour
finishes
dry
i
pick
up
some
brett
and
general
bug
funk
slight
cheesiness
carbonation
is
sharp
on
the
tongue
but
it
isnt
excessive
this
is
a
good
but
not
excellent
example
of
a
geuze
presentation
packaged
in
a
12
7
ounce
green
glass
bottle
with
a
pryoff
crown
served
in
a
new
belgium
brewing
chalice
bottled
on
date
of
20120718
overall
for
a
gueuze
this
one
is
at
the
top
of
my
list
very
traditional
to
the
style
and
very
enjoyable
florida
overall
a
fine
introductory
beer
for
the
style
and
while
id
dont
have
the
capability
to
determine
how
this
stacks
up
with
other
representatives
from
this
style
i
can
tell
you
that
it
was
and
intriguing
beer
that
i
enjoyed
quite
a
bit
and
would
consider
purchasing
again
overall
a
very
solid
gueuze
i
had
a
cantillon
bio
gueuze
the
other
day
and
while
that
was
way
more
complex
this
is
is
right
up
there
in
overall
quality
lots
of
great
sour
flavour
to
sip
on
and
i
will
pick
up
some
more
to
cellar
to
see
how
it
develops

good
carbonation
bottle
indicates
brewed

smells
like
a
typical
lambic
taste
is
typical
sour
but
surprisingly
without
any
hint
of
sweetness
nice
clean
refreshing
beer
with
a
sour
finish
not
a
lot
of
substance
lots
of
unfiltered
goodies
at
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
overall
pretty
nice
gueuze
it
doesnt
measure
up
to
cantillon
3f
and
some
others
but
considering
the
low
price
point
i
think
i
got
this
for
3
99
per
bottle
this
is
a
great
budget
gueuze
bright
acidic
and
funky
character
that
blends
well
with
the
yeasty
malts
this
beer
has
has
a
strong
presence
of
soured
fruit
a
nice
example
of
my
favorite
style
of
beer
pours
a
orangish
brown
with
minimal
head
and
immediately
dissipating
lace
aroma
of
damp
hay
grape
must
bready
yeasts
sourness
is
actually
quite
pleasant
theres
an
earthy
dankness
i
cant
quite
get
around
something
like
mushrooms
having
absorbed
to
much
moisture
this
taste
gains
in
strength
as
the
beer
sits
a
little
while
the
crispness
is
refreshing
this
beer
is
quite
dry
this
is
the
most
acidic
gueuze
ive
ever
had
a
very
high
pucker
factor
pours
a
hazy
gold
with
a
thin
layer
of
white
head
nice
lacing
and
well
carbed
definitely
some
peach
in
the
nose
bit
sweeter
smelling
than
i
expected
the
flavor
has
the
sour
funk
i
expected
though
i
really
wanted
a
bit
more
out
of
it
its
a
very
solid
brew
that
ill
certainly
have
again
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
and
quite
interesting
the
extra
fruitiness
is
different
than
other
geuzes
and
makes
this
one
unique
not
my
favorite
but
it
is
an
enjoyable
drink
the
beer
is
hazy
golden
with
a
small
white
head
aromas
of
hay
grass
barn
funk
typical
gueuze
scents
perhaps
a
sprinkling
of
black
pepper
similar
flavor
with
earth
tones
and
a
mild
grainy
aspect
pretty
tasty
crisp
with
a
dry
finish
for
a
ubiquitous
gueuze
this
isnt
bad
at
all
hazy
golden
straw
color
with
a
finger
and
a
half
of
head
that
dissipates
quickly
the
nose
has
some
artificial
fruit
aromas
like
cherry
koolaid
and
grape
koolaid
clean
pale
malts
a
slight
vinous
quality
and
some
barnyard
funk
i
get
wheat
and
bread
yeast
on
the
front
of
the
tongue
with
a
sharp
sour
attack
on
the
way
down
then
a
lemony
finish
and
nice
bready
aftertaste
drinkable
light
and
highly
carbonated
overall
pretty
good
beer
not
overly
sour
has
a
good
fruity
tart
mix
going
on
i
prefer
a
dryer
less
fruity
gueuze
than
what
this
offers
a
little
too
much
like
a
sour
plum
wine
for
me
murky
golden
color
with
head
reducing
to
ring
of
clumpy
lacing
light
floral
fruity
and
bready
malt
aromas
with
some
sourness
taste
is
some
bright
fruit
with
moderate
sourness
some
bready
malt
oxidation
which
lingers
unpleasantly
on
the
aftertaste
relatively
thin
and
light
mouthfeel
with
fizzy
carbonation
not
very
complex
but
refreshing
and
drinkable
despite
the
aftertaste
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
a
great
gueuze
o
a
good
beer
that
im
glad
i
got
to
try
on
tap
nowhere
near
the
complexity
of
some
other
gueuzes
but
would
make
a
good
into
to
the
style
overly
sour
where
no
sweetness
is
present
unlike
the
smell
lip
smacking
tartness
which
makes
for
a
lingering
aftertaste
watery
with
a
below
average
carbonation
level
poured
a
golden
orange
body
with
wellcarbonated
fizzy
head
that
leaves
little
lace
mostly
a
sour
tart
funky
smell
that
reminded
me
a
bit
of
an
oaky
white
wine
with
sour
applewhite
grape
skin
aroma
the
beer
is
light
bodied
very
sharp
and
crisp
mostly
tart
and
funky
taste
notes
again
along
with
sour
fruit
flavors
a
great
sipper
for
a
simple
gueze
this
is
my
first
gueuze
so
im
hardly
a
connoisseur
poured
a
cloudy
gold
color
37
srm
didnt
generate
much
of
a
head
aroma
was
sour
and
earthy
initial
taste
lit
my
mouth
on
fire
with
high
carbonation
picked
up
tart
sour
apple
flavor
and
some
other
off
flavor
i
couldnt
recognize
or
put
a
label
on
rather
dry
absolutely
no
hop
aroma
flavor
or
bitterness
the
lace
dropped
like
a
rock
leaving
no
evidence
of
a
head
at
all
these
beers
are
known
for
their
complexity
and
this
one
lived
up
to
their
rep
as
for
this
particular
one
been
there
done
that
not
bad
but
ill
be
exploring
other
gueuzes
overall
a
good
tasty
beer
that
will
introduce
anyone
to
the
still
not
too
much
puckering
and
not
too
sour
make
it
a
pretty
drinkable
one
drinkability
renders
fondntradtion
something
i
will
return
to
cheers
the
body
was
light
crisp
and
smooth
with
a
very
dry
tart
finish
drinkability
was
very
good
the
beer
was
gone
quickly
and
i
would
have
had
another
had
i
possessed
another
overall
a
very
nice
brew
not
overpowering
and
quite
enjoyable
certainly
worth
trying
if
you
see
it
overall
the
flavor
and
especially
the
aroma
are
the
outstanding
qualities
of
this
beer
i
like
it
o
nice
beer
for
the
style
but
am
not
really
keen
on
lambic
beers
o
a
decent
gueuze
worth
a
try
a
little
bit
under
the
level
of
complexity
of
some
of
the
other
gueuzes
out
there
but
very
enjoyable
and
the
price
point
is
excellent
overall
a
very
good
clean
straightforward
gueuze
o
great
love
it
even
though
it
is
almost
half
the
price
of
others
it
was
really
a
great
beer
poured
into
a
pint
glass
gueuze
fond
tradition
is
a
superb
version
of
the
style
its
dry
and
earthen
character
is
quintessential
of
the
style
and
that
is
delivered
with
ease
yet
still
the
ale
deserves
even
drier
character
even
deeper
earthiness
and
intangibles
like
almond
pithiness
and
peps
of
cinnamon
that
could
really
set
it
apart
pours
a
mostly
clear
light
copper
with
only
a
half
finger
of
offwhite
head
relatively
subtle
aroma
is
comprised
of
lemon
and
light
funk
definitely
not
the
most
complex
aroma
but
pleasant
enough
similarly
the
taste
is
somewhat
light
and
very
refreshing
with
lemon
again
leading
the
way
along
with
some
very
mild
funk
mouthfeel
is
light
and
crisp
with
a
semidry
finish
overall
a
very
refreshing
gueuze
though
nowhere
near
the
complexity
of
the
better
blends
still
i
would
have
this
again
when
in
the
mood
for
a
lighter
version
of
the
style
and
the
price
point
is
good
as
well
o
im
glad
i
got
to
try
this
beer
thanks
to
the
bottle
shop
i
scored
it
in
down
in
missoula
good
all
around
but
im
sure
cantillon
has
better
examples
of
the
style
o
good
for
the
style
although
not
great
o
not
one
of
my
favorite
gueuzes
but
pretty
good
once
you
get
past
the
initial
vinegar
notes
drinkability
is
pretty
good
the
nose
is
fantastic
but
the
quick
finish
is
a
little
disappointing
seems
to
have
lost
some
complexity
with
time
contrary
to
my
expectations
overall
they
say
that
if
it
looks
like
a
pig
acts
like
a
pig
and
tastes
like
a
pig
this
looks
good
smells
good
but
to
me
doesnt
taste
good
so
im
guessing
this
style
just
isnt
for
me
i
cant
taste
anything
wrong
with
it
just
dont
like
it
bear
in
mind
that
while
ive
been
drinking
beer
a
little
while
im
new
to
reviewing
and
this
is
my
first
of
the
style
poured
a
bright
gold
with
a
fingers
worth
of
head
into
a
tulip
slight
haze
present
which
is
expected
since
it
is
an
unfiltered
lambic
tart
sour
with
a
slight
pale
malt
present
in
the
nose
quite
inviting
and
not
overly
sour
nose
palate
starts
out
quite
tart
with
raspberries
and
lemon
there
as
well
medium
bodied
with
a
slight
dry
finish
quite
tart
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
lambic
im
reasonably
new
to
whites
of
this
style
and
i
have
only
had
a
couple
but
i
am
beginning
to
appreciate
this
style
a
lot
i
love
how
this
takes
a
much
more
sourtart
approach
without
the
fruit
assault
present
in
most
other
lambics
i
have
tasted
really
nice
cheers
mf
high
carbonation
pretty
full
bodied
it
works
dramatics
aside
this
beer
is
immensely
tart
and
if
you
can
love
that
than
youll
absolutely
love
this
beer
poured
a
cloudy
orange
with
a
thin
white
head
that
left
no
lacing
scents
of
brett
funk
barnyard
like
scents
and
some
slight
fruit
flavor
begins
with
sour
notes
reminiscent
of
lemon
theres
also
a
dry
white
wine
like
flavor
underneath
the
sour
it
finishes
on
a
dry
note
with
a
very
grainy
flavor
that
carries
into
the
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
high
carbonation
its
a
good
geuze
though
not
as
complex
as
the
other
ive
tried
worth
trying
but
not
what
id
call
my
favorite
for
the
style
overall
a
very
complex
and
refreshing
beer
the
balance
between
malt
character
and
yeast
derived
aromaflavor
works
wonderfully
and
gives
the
beer
dual
purpose
as
both
an
afternoon
thirst
quencher
and
a
mealtime
accompaniment
re
lack
of
musty
barnyard
character
possibly
blend
with
more
of
the
older
more
developed
lambic
to
pronounce
the
earthy
character
of
the
senne
river
valley
otherwise
a
wonderful
gueuze
small
head
but
excellent
lacing
on
my
out
on
a
slightly
hazy
golden
with
orange
hue
body
flavor
is
very
fruity
somewhat
spicey
with
hints
if
grain
and
club
soda
flavor
has
a
nice
tart
and
sour
citrus
throughout
with
a
wild
and
funky
presence
and
nice
yeast
flavoring
light
to
medium
body
and
moderate
carbonation
definitely
sharper
and
more
flavorful
than
others
i
have
had
in
the
style
excellent
wild
and
sour
presence
o
refreshing
in
the
only
way
a
sour
can
a
little
like
a
shanty
this
was
crisp
and
tart
and
had
the
perfect
amount
of
carbonation
i
noticed
a
high
amount
of
floating
yeast
but
this
does
not
bother
me
it
is
unfiltered
after
all
enjoyed
super
cold
from
a
tulip
glass
overall
this
is
an
above
average
sour
at
a
reasonable
price
paid
9
00
for
12
7
oz
o
a
very
nice
gueuze
complex
bacterial
character
really
makes
this
one
o
extra
tart
and
dry
with
limited
funk
excepting
the
nose
o
overal
a
medium
sour
liked
it
the
beer
pours
like
liquid
copper
with
a
nice
white
head
that
sits
as
a
half
fingers
width
above
the
glass
the
beers
body
is
murky
like
swamp
water
with
a
great
torrent
of
carbonation
constantly
flowing
to
replenish
the
head
its
not
the
most
beautiful
thing
to
look
at
in
the
glass
but
it
isnt
the
ugliest
either
the
beers
lacing
is
light
and
splotchy
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
on
the
nose
the
beer
smells
properly
funky
with
a
big
sweet
cherry
fruit
leather
and
a
touch
of
musty
barnyard
the
wheat
malts
are
light
here
but
surprisingly
i
can
pick
up
a
bit
of
a
cereal
breadiness
in
the
nose
on
the
tongue
the
beer
tastes
properly
acidic
with
big
interplay
of
sweet
funk
and
sweet
cereal
malt
on
the
back
the
beer
begins
with
acidic
sweet
water
which
opens
quickly
into
cherry
fruit
leather
with
touches
of
barnyard
before
rushing
into
a
finish
of
thick
wheat
cereal
malts
that
start
syrupy
blending
with
the
cherry
flavors
before
turning
dry
and
powdery
the
aftertaste
is
long
ringing
lightly
with
funk
and
acid
on
the
mouth
the
beer
feels
medium
light
in
body
and
leaves
the
tongue
tingling
and
a
little
dry
the
beers
carbonation
is
high
prickling
the
tongue
nicely
though
not
as
strongly
as
some
gueuze
overall
this
is
a
tasty
beer
with
some
nice
complexity
but
a
bit
short
of
a
full
gueuze
flavor
for
me
its
delicious
and
quite
easy
to
drink
but
really
mellow
on
the
back
of
the
palate
and
the
taste
of
wheat
in
such
strength
is
surprising
for
the
style
i
like
this
beer
i
just
dont
think
it
is
quite
a
gueuze
this
beer
is
worth
a
try
overall
this
one
is
one
is
just
ok
overall
this
is
a
good
representative
of
the
gueuze
style
and
a
good
substitute
for
the
classic
cantillon
gueuze
best
of
the
style
imho
which
is
much
harder
to
get
at
least
here
in
kansas
city
its
also
very
reasonably
priced
i
think
ill
need
to
buy
a
bottle
to
age
and
see
how
it
develops
its
very
good
fresh
o
love
it
would
go
well
with
sharp
cheese
after
first
sip
i
thought
i
wouldnt
want
the
whole
bottle
but
its
complex
and
leaves
me
wanting
more
my
first
gueuze
and
i
am
very
interested
in
trying
more
following
this
one
o
overall
a
decent
gueuze
not
my
favorite
as
the
sourness
and
funk
is
very
light
and
it
is
a
little
too
sweet
for
me
but
better
than
no
gueuze
on
tap
could
see
someone
trying
to
get
into
the
style
liking
this
one
as
a
gateway
gueuze
would
have
it
again
sometime
overall
a
great
example
of
a
classic
gueuze
not
the
most
complex
take
on
the
style
but
definitely
a
fantastic
introduction
to
the
diverse
world
of
sours
beautiful
amber
color
while
im
relatively
new
to
gueuzes
this
strikes
me
as
a
solid
offering
and
a
good
value
for
the
money
about
6
usd
ill
be
back
for
more
gueuze
is
hard
to
come
by
and
for
this
being
readily
available
and
at
6
a
pop
you
cant
go
wrong
or
you
can
dish
out
3
times
as
much
for
delicious
3
fonteinen
o
a
decent
enough
gueuze
not
at
the
top
of
my
list
for
the
style
but
it
is
still
solid
and
definitely
worth
the
lower
than
average
price
overall
id
say
this
is
a
decent
gueuze
not
the
best
ive
had
but
still
enjoyable
would
have
it
again
if
i
wasnt
able
to
get
my
hands
on
some
say
lindemans
gueuze
cuve
rene
and
i
had
a
taste
for
some
gueuze
but
there
are
some
better
options
available
out
there
usually
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
brew
was
the
sourness
through
the
nose
it
was
nicely
drying
helping
to
box
out
any
overt
residual
sugars
all
while
retaining
the
big
sourness
and
tartness
so
perfect
to
the
style
the
taste
did
follow
nicely
with
sourdough
breadiness
and
that
same
hearty
sourness
and
funk
there
was
less
fruity
sweetness
than
expected
so
expect
for
this
one
to
be
a
bit
more
serious
on
the
palate
the
grain
too
was
a
bit
chalky
and
seemed
out
of
place
but
things
otherwise
stayed
pretty
juicy
despite
the
wild
bitterness
of
yeast
filtered

a
white

medium

ok
but
the

was
offputting
happy
to
discover
a
6
50375ml
gueuze
thats
actually
reasonably
good
a
excellent
gueuze
here
and
definitely
good
to
find
around
these
parts
while
i
still
wait
for
cantillon
to
show
up
someday
definitely
not
as
exaggerated
as
their
lambics
though
and
this
is
a
really
good
one
for
beginners
getting
into
the
gueuze
style
this
balanced
enough
which
makes
it
easy
to
drink
yet
complex
enough
to
attract
wowed
reactions
from
beer
fans
of
all
kinds
particularly
sours
hoorah
o
never
tasted
anything
like
this
before
then
again
this
is
only
the
second
true
gueuze
ive
ever
had
and
the
first
lindemans
cuvee
rene
was
too
sour
for
me
i
like
this
ones
balance
and
restrained
tartness
i
picked
it
out
because
i
love
st
louis
framboise
and
figured
id
try
something
else
by
them
so
glad
i
did
even
if
it
was
a
little
steep
at
8
for
a
12
7

bottle
pours
a

14
inch

of

slight

smells
of
a
hint
of
pale

hint
of
alcohol
strong
tartness
strong
sourness
and
a
hint
of
citrus
fits
the
style
of
a
gueuze
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
tartness
strong
sour
notes
slight
pale

and
slight

overall
good
appearance
aroma
and
blend
another
tasty
gueuze
that
i
hope
evades
the
attention
of
minnesotans
for
years
to
come
a
little
young
and
uneven
this
one
o
a
very
nice
gueuze
definitely
worth
picking
up
it
would
improve
considerably
if
the
funkiness
carried
through
more
strongly
in
the
flavor
regardless
finding
a
sixyearold
gueuze
for
less
than
7
a
bottle
is
a
steal
o
having
this
relatively
plentiful
and
available
is
a
blessing
will
certainly
have
again
o
im
impressed
i
didnt
get
a
lot
of
vinegar
like
some
others
had
thank
goodness
would
definitely
pour
again
o
a
very
nice
gueuze
with
a
refreshing
tartness
and
a
light
touch
of
fruitiness
its
has
balance
and
id
defiantly
buy
this
again
given
the
chance
gueuzes
are
a
rare
treat
for
me
so
id
best
enjoy
this
on
its
own
and
shared
with
some
friends
m
light
to
medium
bodied
good
carbonation
o
good
but
inferior
to
some
other
commercially
available
gueuzes
in
my
opinion
o
didnt
quite
hit
the
spot
for
me
came
across
a
bit
weak
in
the
taste
maybe
a
little
too
heavy
on
the
young
lambic
in
the
blend
overall
not
a
good
gueuze
but
drinkable
very
sour
and
vinegary
without
the
characteristics
i
love
about
the
style
served
from
tap
into
a
trappe
door
tulip
poured
yelloworange
with
a
two
finger
white
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
slowly
maintained
decent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
citrus
rine
funk
sour
and
tart
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
citrus
citrus
rine
funk
and
tart
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
high
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
good
brew
i
have
had
this
so
many
times
out
of
the
bottle
it
is
seriously
not
even
funny
so
when
i
saw
this
ontap
i
had
no
choice
but
try
this
one
with
it
being
on
tap
it
actually
enhanced
the
citrus
aspect
of
this
one
for
me
i
was
really
happy
that
this
was
the
case
rather
than
just
drinking
the
same
beer
over
and
over
drink
this
one
rather
it
is
in
a
bottle
or
ontap
you
wont
regret
it
high
b
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
smooth
and
pretty
drinkable
with
a
nice
medium
body
that
is
feels
like
sour
silk
smooth
with
a
little
crisp
dry
finish
beer
is
medium
to
mediumlight
bodied
with
a
moderate
amount
of
wateriness
around
the
edges
which
isnt
particularly
desirable
and
again
makes
me
think
more
of
a
heavier
lemonade
than
a
gueuze
carbonation
is
at
the
medium
level
which
foams
this
up
nicely
on
the
palate
resulting
in
a
smooth
mouthfeel
initially
before
the
beer
kindoffallsapartintowateriness
closes
out
dryly
with
a
lingering
bitterness
a
majorly
tart
sour
beer
pours
a
champaignlike
bubbly
pale
yellow
with
a
bit
of
haze
and
an
excited
white
head
smells
like
brett
but
not
entirely
there
is
some
other
sour
element
here
not
particularly
fruity
i
cant
quite
place
it
flavor
is
of
course
very
puckery
starting
out
sour
and
a
little
lemony
escalating
to
an
almost
sour
warhead
candy
intense
soure
for
just
a
second
then
backing
off
into
a
manageable
dry
musty
finish
mouthfeel
is
nice
ultra
light
on
the
body
with
extremely
intense
carbonation
easy
drinking
but
an
intense
experience
really
a
beer
like
none
ive
ever
had
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
a
great
introduction
to
the
gueuze
style
this
looks
much
darker
than
any
gueuze
i
can
ever
recall
its
a
brownish
orange
flavor
is
a
punch
in
the
mouth
of
typical
sour
gueuzeness
if
you
use
that
word
from
here
on
out
ill
expect
a
quarter
in
royalties
i
get
a
lot
of
lacto
on
this
one
overall
it
hits
the
mouth
and
makes
the
mouth
contract
and
contort
as
youd
expect
for
the
style
not
too
shabby
especially
considering
the
style
appears
an
apricot
glowing
haziness
minimal
head
retention
and
lacing
but
the
looks
is
quite
nice
an
off
white
foaming
head
aroma
has
barnyard
funkiness
to
it
with
tart
fruits
including
peach
apricot
earthiness
tart
acidic
lemons
with
lactic
yogurt
notes
as
well
flavor
is
refreshing
tart
and
has
lemon
peel
upfront
with
acidic
notes
of
mild
vinegarette
or
a
tart
plain
yogurt
extremely
tasty
with
fruit
undertones
this
is
real
lambic
and
more
assertive
than
the
overtly
sugar
filled
lindemans
mouthfeel
finishes
bone
dry
light
to
medium
bodied
with
ample
soft
carbonation
goes
down
way
too
easily
overall
one
of
the
better
traditional
guezue
lambics
ive
come
across
this
beer
pours
a
light
bodied
dull
orangish
gold
in
color
with
a
one
finger
bright
white
head
that
turned
to
a
lacing
in
a
minute
or
so
the
nose
is
full
of
dried
peaches
acetic
sour
hay
funk
brett
with
a
slight
citrus
sweetness
pretty
solid
nose
the
flavors
are
dry
and
funky
there
is
a
moderate
amount
of
hay
and
barnyard
to
pair
with
an
acidic
and
somewhat
citrusy
sour
finish
the
flavors
dont
disappoint
its
light
and
easy
to
drink
it
does
gave
slightly
more
carbonation
than
a
lot
of
gueuze
though
overall
this
is
a
pretty
decent
gueuze
it
definitely
doesnt
disappoint
i
would
definitely
take
this
over
oud
beersel
or
boon
any
day
o
a
pretty
nice
drink
i
would
check
it
out
again
o
simple
but
good
this
has
all
of
the
great
elements
of
a
quality
gueuze
and
at
an
affordable
price
some
astringenciesburn
in
the
feel
but
lasting
flavor
that
finishes
clean
better
than
the
money
paid
for
o
a
nice
beer
and
a
bit
different
then
what
i
was
expecting
from
a
gueuze
some
of
the
flavors
were
a
bit
confusing
to
find
in
a
beer
for
a
newbie
but
the
nice
body
and
carbonation
help
smooth
things
out
formed
an
excellent
pairing
with
the
dinner
as
well
cheers
o
a
decent
gueuze
but
would
have
liked
it
a
bit
more
sour
would
probably
drink
it
again
though
overall
a
decent
gueuze
though
id
rather
pay
a
few
more
dollars
at
the
store
to
get
one
a
bit
better
3f
1882
bl
tilquin
etc
o
well
balanced
gueuze
perfect
amount
of
tartness
very
tasty
o
a
great
beer
that
i
will
reach
for
again
t
theres
definitely
nothing
bad
about
this
beer
but
it
lacks
something
i
cant
quite
put
my
finger
on
lots
of
lemon
tartness
and
some
faint
pale
malt
not
much
funk
to
speak
of
here
and
thats
what
i
was
kind
of
hoping
for
still
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
overall
i
enjoyed
this
would
not
drink
this
all
the
time
but
a
nice
change
this
is
my
first
of
this
style
so
forgive
my
ignorance
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
not
my
favorite
style
but
this
didnt
last
long
in
my
glass
goldenamber
colored
beer
with
a
fizzy
white
head
the
beer
has
a
barnyard
horse
funk
thats
really
enjoyable
grass
fresh
earth
and
hay
after
the
initially
intense
sourness
the
beer
shows
its
balance
lots
of
flavor
along
with
underripe
fruit
apples
apricots
pears
and
refreshing
sourness
dry
although
not
as
bonedry
as
many
lambics
enjoyable
brew
overall
this
is
a
good
gueuze
but
could
be
great
if
the
flavors
were
a
tad
more
assertive
i
would
definitely
have
this
again
but
there
are
other
lambics
i
would
drink
ahead
of
this
one
if
given
the
option
still
its
price
tag
is
less
than
many
of
its
style
so
it
can
definitely
fullfil
a
craving
for
funk
when
on
a
budget
definitely
a
worthy
offering
pours
a
clear
light
golden
color
with
plenty
of
visible
carbonation
initial
foamy
white
heady
quickly
recedes
to
half
an
inch
and
has
some
good
staying
power
light
lacing
and
a
thin
cap
throughout
the
nose
is
mostly
acidic
with
a
bit
of
lemon
not
too
much
funk
and
the
same
goes
for
the
flavor
nothing
off
really
just
balanced
in
a
different
direction
than
i
would
go
light
crisp
body
with
a
fairlyheavy
lemonlike
acidity
through
the
finish
which
is
quite
dry
a
decent
gueuze
especially
for
the
price
light
body
finishes
clean
with
a
crisp
twang
near
the
end
sourness
is
the
only
thing
that
lingers
but
not
for
very
long
overall
great
but
there
are
better
gueuze
beers
from
belgium
however
this
is
an
awesome
beer
and
for
the
price
and
availability
a
great
option
compared
to
drie
fonteinen
or
cantillon
this
is
a
true
lambic
and
not
a
super
sweet
fake
version
either
so
def
worth
a
shot
for
all
the
sour
fans
out
there
this
was
my
first
gueuze
i
was
hesitant
to
try
one
because
of
the
lambic
nature
ive
read
about
i
equate
lambics
with
framboise
and
peach
beers
that
have
sugar
added
i
took
the
plunge
and
found
out
that
this
is
not
the
case
i
really
enjoyed
the
sweetness
of
this
beer
because
it
wasnt
over
the
top
it
was
really
balanced
im
guessing
due
to
the
nature
of
the
older
lambic
it
was
mixed
with
i
am
happy
i
tried
this
gueuze
first
as
it
turned
me
on
to
the
style
overall
a
pretty
good
gueuze
with
a
nice
tart
bite
fills
my
sour
fix
for
sure
very
solid
for
the
price
point
pours
a
murky
orange
with
a
1
inch
fizzy
bone
colored
head
that
fades
to
nothing
no
lacing
on
this
one
some
floating
sediment
is
present
in
the
glass
smell
is
funky
and
tart
but
there
is
a
particular
sweet
smell
too
a
bit
of
a
skunky
aroma
came
from
the
green
bottle
when
it
was
opened
but
is
not
present
after
the
beer
is
poured
taste
is
also
tart
and
funky
but
it
gives
way
after
each
sip
with
a
slightly
sweet
aftertaste
this
beer
has
a
higher
level
of
carbonation
with
a
very
crisp
and
bubbly
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
gueuze
with
a
better
smell
than
taste
but
still
a
good
beer
to
try
mf
moderate
body
but
the
carbonation
levels
make
it
feel
a
little
lighter
overall
i
have
to
admit
that
i
am
new
to
lambics
in
general
and
also
to
the
gueuze
style
but
i
know
they
are
supposed
to
be
intense
and
fruity
and
this
one
has
not
failed
my
expectations
at
all
i
quite
enjoy
it
owhen
i
pick
a
random
sour
im
usually
nervous
but
im
quite
pleased
with
this
one
all
around
it
absolutely
will
satisfy
your
sour
craving
theres
not
much
complexity
to
it
but
it
is
definitely
a
good
beer
and
it
disappeared
rather
quickly
light
orange
brown
with
a
very
nice
three
finger
head
of
lace
and
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
streaming
up
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
nice
retention
only
gradually
let
the
head
fade
away
what
was
left
was
a
very
nice
set
of
concentric
side
glass
rings
of
lace
smell
was
very
sour
lots
of
grapes
and
other
fruits
a
bit
light
on
the
nose
before
the
sour
wrath
kicks
in
flavor
was
very
full
and
robust
nice
yeast
filled
flavor
wrecks
your
taste
buds
but
calms
down
considerably
on
the
finish
a
huge
rush
of
sour
fruit
than
kicks
into
overdrive
and
puckers
your
lips
through
the
finish
this
was
a
wonderfully
unique
brew
that
had
a
very
good
flavor
and
a
light
fruity
feel
that
really
made
it
shine
i
could
see
why
it
is
rated
so
high
as
it
is
quite
different
then
anything
i
had
tried
in
the
past
i
love
this
style
and
this
is
an
excellent
representation
of
it
mouthfeel
was
on
the
leaner
side
of
medium
drinkability
was
ok
not
alot
of
balance
or
complexity
of
sour
flavor
i
have
another
bottle
to
put
down
and
age
and
see
how
this
develops
perfectly
middleoftheroad
for
me
given
the
price
of
my
pour
9
i
cant
see
myself
springing
for
this
again
the
tradition
was
very
good
i
liked
it
a
lot

overall
quite
refreshing
and
tasty
despite
being
a
little
one
dimensional
quality
gueuze
poured
a
cloudy
almost
murky
golden
yellow
with
a
thin
cap
of
white
head
aroma
was
pretty
light
actually
tart
with
notes
of
lemon
zest
and
apple
skin
and
a
bit
of
barnyard
funk
taste
was
very
nice
balance
of
tart
and
sweet
apples
and
lemon
zest
wet
grass
spicy
yeast
and
maybe
just
a
drop
of
berry
juice
medium
mouthfeel
nice
and
crisp
and
zesty
drinkable
not
too
overbearing
or
sour
and
quite
good
even
if
not
totally
exemplary
of
the
style
o
i
dont
have
a
lot
of
experience
with
gueuzes
but
this
is
enjoyable
im
not
sure
if
id
get
this
again
but
it
makes
me
want
to
try
more
from
this
style
overall
a
very
good
gueuze
not
very
complex
and
not
overly
sour
but
a
good
solid
base
and
very
drinkable
nice
beer
liked
the
appearance
taste
smell
mouthfeel
everything
not
overly
complex
or
crazy
sour
but
a
very
nice
session
gueuze
that
really
hit
the
spot
not
overly
pricey
either
would
try
again
pours
a
hazy
golden
with
a
rocky
white
head
smells
initially
of
sour
apple
followed
by
an
onslaught
of
funky
barnyard
taste
is
initially
warhead
candy
acid
followed
by
some
green
apple
cider
a
bit
of
grainy
wheat
and
finishing
with
an
aged
cheese
flavor
mouthfeel
was
smooth
average
carbonation
overall
interesting
although
quite
tart
and
sour
the
funky
smell
was
just
at
about
the
limit
for
me
though
i
was
glad
i
got
to
try
this
beer
overall
packs
a
tartsour
punch
but
thats
about
it
nice
green
apple
flavor
keeps
things
interesting
but
its
not
rewarding
a
decent
middle
of
the
road
gueuze
in
every
way
i
enjoyed
the
beer
but
am
still
getting
used
to
the
style
i
enjoyed
how
the
citrus
intermingled
with
the
sourness
and
wasnt
completely
overpowered
o
i
wont
buy
this
one
another
time
theres
no
reason
to
do
that
overall
not
bad
but
i
enjoy
boon
geuze
a
bit
more
despite
what
this
past
paragraph
says
i
actually
liked
this
beer
a
lot
o
not
as
intense
as
im
used
to
from
this
style
might
good
for
the
intiate
to
the
style
overall
solid
offering
but
nothing
amazing
o
good
lambic
to
try
out
as
a
first
overall
a
good
beer
i
wouldnt
mind
trying
again
not
bad
for
7
99
great
to
relax
and
sip
on
drink
eh
it
wasnt
that
good
and
it
wasnt
that
bad
just
a
bit
thick
for
the
style
didnt
satisfy
as
i
would
have
liked
it
to
9
on
tap
at
najas
a
somewhat
sweet
and
lemony
version
of
a
gueuze
i
would
have
preferred
less
sweetness
and
far
more
biting
sour
tartness
d
i
really
liked
this
beer
went
well
with
my
mussels
at
brasserie
beck
dc
worked
well
with
fine
cheeses
and
fish
entree
i
would
highly
recommend
to
others
overall
a
fine
example
of
the
lambic
tradition
d
this
was
a
very
nice
gueuze
that
was
balanced
between
tart
and
funky
with
some
sweetness
so
it
wasnt
overpowering
the
body
was
fitting
and
it
had
a
very
smooth
finish
so
it
was
surprisingly
easy
to
drink
good
example
of
the
style
for
those
learning
to
appreciate
sours
im
sure
it
could
age
for
a
long
time
but
it
was
still
quite
enjoyable
relatively
fresh
pours
a
nice
golden
orange
color
aroma
is
sweet
sour
funky
and
cidery
follows
through
to
the
taste
with
a
pronounced
acidic
sour
note
lemon
peel
tart
sour
apple
candy
and
a
mellow
funk
all
grace
the
palate
great
effervescence
though
a
bit
more
mellowed
ontap
versus
the
bottle
finishes
light
airy
dry
and
crisp
the
bugs
really
did
their
job
on
this
one
a
nice
sour
and
a
smooth
sophisticated
one
at
that
drinkability
4
o
another
good
beer
but
im
still
kinda
left
wondering
what
all
the
hype
is
about
not
wanting
to
spend
big
money
on
the
rare
ones
to
find
out
yet
will
definitely
keep
exploring
this
style
just
enough
to
keep
me
intrigued
narrative
47
years
of
service
francine
manzana
gave
that
caramel
apple
pop
company
the
best
years
of
her
life
and
she
was
terminated
for
cause
for
reading
a
patricia
cornwell
novel
when
she
wasnt
clocked
out
francine
wasnt
going
to
take
this
lying
down
she
knew
the
secret
behind
the
tartness
in
those
pops
and
she
had
full
intention
on
taking
this
issue
public
with
her
box
of
belongings
from
her
desk
she
strode
over
to
the
quality
control
center
only
to
find
that
loretta
was
out
i
will
make
them
feel
the
tart
bitterness
of
abandonment
just
like
they
showed
me
with
a
few
calibrations
she
reset
the
dials
and
the
mixture
began
running
an
entirely
new
batch
of
caramel
apple
pops
through
the
line
she
stared
at
her
spiteful
reflection
in
the
bubbling
pool
of
acidic
green
glucose
the
wafts
of
the
additional
citric
acid
stung
her
eyes
and
nostrils
francine
smiled
and
tossed
her
mystery
novel
into
the
simmering
goo
for
she
had
an
unemployment
officer
to
speak
to
bottled
june
2008
o
this
one
is
pretty
hardcore
not
really
balanced
but
thats
the
goodness
for
me
really
sour
o
this
is
a
good
beer
would
enjoy
another
one
anytime
i
came
across
it
but
would
not
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
it
this
is
a
great
gueuze
the
flavors
are
balanced
very
well
and
provide
an
explosion
of
flavor
with
a
fairly
quick
decay
o
this
is
well
balanced
in
all
the
right
areas
this
was
also
priced
pretty
well
at
7
a
great
entry
level
gueze
to
try
along
with
a
cuvee
rene
ive
been
drinking
more
and
more
lambics
now
through
and
im
just
really
craving
the
funky
brett
notes
big
froth
of
head
rises
upwards
rapidly
apple
juice
hues
and
champagne
bubbles
aromas
are
very
dirty
and
earthy
with
an
extra
funky
barny
aroma
tangy
apples
and
lemony
tartness
in
the
flavormuch
cleaner
and
less
earthy
than
the
aroma
would
have
led
me
to
believe
thin
mouthfeel
no
complaints
about
the
carbonation
im
ok
with
the
thin
mouthfeel
as
long
as
theres
a
full
flavor
this
gueuze
fails
to
stick
its
sour
flavors
to
my
taste
buds
for
very
long
bitterness
lingers
and
my
mouth
is
watering
but
theres
just
a
little
bit
missing
tiny
cap
of
froth
and
some
layers
of
lace
stick
around
i
tried
this
beer
on
may
19
2011
at
smokeless
joe
in
toronto
ontario
canada
the
beer
poured
a
hazy
pinkishorange
with
a
thin
white
head
one
which
was
easily
replenshed
the
aroma
was
tart
fruit
grains
and
yeast
the
mouthfeel
was
weak
bodied
and
highly
carbonated
the
flavour
was
tart
fruit
and
more
tart
fruit
overall
this
was
a
fun
little
gueuze
it
does
not
compare
to
some
of
the
epic
monsters
of
the
style
but
it
is
a
nice
refreshing
beer
overall
a
good
example
of
the
style
not
as
complex
as
i
might
of
hoped
for
this
has
a
nice
amount
of
musty
funk
and
sour
to
it
not
going
overboard
but
not
layin
low
either
mostly
apples
as
i
recall
and
this
went
pretty
well
with
a
house
salad
o
a
really
exciting
beer
that
is
far
outside
of
the
norm
for
the
beers
i
typically
drink
crisp
and
refreshing
with
a
light
green
flavor
that
lingered
on
quite
pleasantly
4
0
o
tart
and
sour
these
gueuzes
are
going
further
to
bring
me
into
liking
sour
beers
more
edit
as
this
warmed
up
i
found
it
more
and
more
like
apple
cider
the
numbers
have
been
edited
to
reflect
this
although
i
still
think
this
is
a
decent
sour
for
the
pricetag
it
certainly
is
far
from
being
an
arated
gueuze
d
on
the
whole
with
a
few
defects
this
is
a
well
done
drinkable
beer
mouthfeel
is
crisp
but
not
quite
dry
with
a
rather
heavy
feel
for
5
beer
overall
a
solid
gueuze
for
any
sour
lover
to
try
pours
a
hazy
orangeish
color
with
a
light
tan
head
in
the
aroma
sugary
to
sour
white
grapes
in
the
taste
dry
sourness
fruity
especially
white
grapes
a
sour
bite
and
a
medium
to
lighter
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
white
grape
tartness
in
the
aftertaste
nice
sour
quite
sweet
in
the
nose
but
dry
in
the
taste
i
can
dig
it
mouthfeel
is
lively
due
the
tartness
and
high
level
of
carbonation
o
very
well
done
gueuze
this
is
up
there
with
what
a
great
gueuze
should
taste
like
im
looking
forward
to
picking
up
a
few
more
of
these
really
liked
this
cheers
d
this
is
a
pretty
solid
beer
only
my
second
dive
into
the
gueze
style
but
it
has
left
me
wanting
more
not
bad
for
the
price
i
paid
for
it
either
ill
have
to
revisit
this
was
really
my
first
gueze
experience
i
had
tried
other
lambics
before
such
as
lindemans
boons
and
a
few
others
but
all
had
been
fruit
beers
when
i
first
tried
gueze
fond
tradition
i
was
amazed
at
how
different
it
tasted
i
loved
the
taste
and
feeling
on
the
tongue
as
it
was
very
crisp
and
didnt
linger
for
too
long
there
is
a
very
strong
acidity
to
this
beer
and
a
few
friends
commented
on
it
and
the
tartness
the
lambics
are
certainly
a
unique
and
great
types
of
beers
and
i
hope
to
sample
a
lot
more
in
the
near
future
o
nice
mid
range
gueuze
gets
the
job
done
for
my
money
the
beer
dances
on
the
palate
with
plenty
of
carbonation
the
flavors
pack
a
sour
punch
the
lemon
tartness
forms
the
backbone
for
the
vinegar
yeast
and
barnyard
flavors
earthy
notes
are
subdued
compared
to
the
lemon
sourness
but
it
lurks
underneath
reminding
us
this
brew
is
indeed
a
belgian
brew
o
overall
this
is
a
good
classic
gueze
this
style
is
really
starting
to
grow
on
me
and
this
is
an
enjoyable
brew
the
375
ml
serving
is
plenty
due
to
the
high
acidity
in
the
mouthfeel
not
overly
complex
but
has
no
faults
is
inexpensive
for
the
style
and
has
good
drinkability
would
serve
well
as
a
gateway
to
the
style
i
would
pick
this
up
again
d
this
is
a
very
nice
gueuze
love
those
sour
ales
d
its
not
overthetop
at
all
instead
its
a
very
good
gueuze
with
good
drinkability
although
the
acid
combined
with
the
last
brew
is
starting
to
churn
in
my
stomach
goes
down
smoothly
leaves
some
creaminess
in
the
mouth
a
good
gueuze
especially
for
its
price
d
due
to
my
lack
of
experience
with
sours
i
rate
this
at
a
fairly
low
drinkability
even
with
the
moderate
alcohol
level
d
while
i
had
no
problem
finishing
this
one
i
wont
get
it
again
the
price
may
be
right
at
7
50
but
id
rather
pay
a
couple
bucks
more
for
a
worldbeater
gueuze
cantillon
or
boon
not
this
pale
imitation
pours
a
slightly
hazy
orangish
gold
color
with
a
small
white
head
that
quickly
thins
out
and
disappears
scent
is
very
nice
very
funky
and
sour
smelling
with
some
nice
funky
cheese
aromas
the
taste
however
is
not
as
nice
as
it
smells
the
scent
implies
this
beer
is
going
to
be
a
super
funky
cheesy
complex
barnyard
sour
adventure
although
the
taste
is
sour
with
some
nice
lemon
flavors
it
is
not
nearly
as
complex
of
funky
as
i
was
hoping
this
does
not
mean
the
beer
tastes
bad
there
are
just
so
many
better
examples
of
a
gueuze
out
there
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
on
the
light
side
but
not
to
thin
maybe
a
bit
watery
drinkability
is
still
fairly
high
as
it
is
a
very
refreshing
beer
d
this
is
a
great
gueuze
if
you
are
able
to
find
it
i
wasnt
too
hopeful
going
in
to
it
given
that
their
other
lambics
are
pasteurized
and
sweetened
beyond
recognition
overall
this
had
all
the
flavors
i
expected
to
find
but
not
a
whole
lot
more
especially
in
the
way
of
complexity
nonetheless
with
the
limited
availability
of
gueuzes
in
america
i
can
confidently
recommend
this
as
a
good
gueuze
drinkability
good
but
not
the
best
pretty
good
price
medium
bodied
and
lightly
carbonated
has
a
syrupy
feel
on
the
teeth
not
terribly
acidic
finishes
quite
dry
d
was
good
but
the
sour
fruit
taste
and
wet
musky
taste
were
faint
this
was
an
ok
tasting
gueuze
for
the
price
but
i
would
spend
a
few
more
for
cantillon3for
cuvee
renesame
price
then
this
one
bottle
picked
up
at
dennis
bros
poured
into
an
allagash
tulip
glass
a
clear
apple
juice
colored
orange
color
with
some
small
floaties
making
their
way
around
the
glass
slight
white
head
that
collars
around
the
glass
fruity
sour
aroma
in
the
nose
along
with
some
wheat
and
funk
but
nothing
too
major
light
mouthfeel
not
sure
how
old
this
is
but
it
has
a
nice
sourness
to
it
that
is
balancedout
with
some
fruit
type
sweetness
some
funk
kicks
in
in
the
middle
pretty
decent
drinking
beer
ends
with
some
lingering
sweetness
nice
sparkling
mouthfeel
very
appropriate
this
is
a
nice
example
of
the
style
if
i
have
a
hankering
for
a
sour
ale
i
wont
be
disappointed
in
this
one
very
good
stuff
and
quite
interesting
mellow
slightly
subdued
but
flavorful
gueuze
drinkability
i
enjoyed
trying
this
one
but
not
my
favorite
gueuze
beter
than
i
expected
and
thankfully
not
sweetfakeetc
needs
more
funk
and
heft
not
cantillon
or
3f
but
will
do
in
a
pinch
d
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
compared
to
others
in
the
style
d
i
really
could
drink
this
one
all
day
if
it
was
not
so
sour
but
i
would
not
mind
trying
this
is
a
fantastic
gueuze
definitely
fitting
for
when
you
need
that
sour
fix
up
there
with
some
of
the
best
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
medium
head
and
some
good
lace
the
aroma
is
a
bit
cidery
with
some
barnyard
aroma
and
a
good
bit
of
sweat
the
flavor
is
very
dry
and
very
sour
with
a
little
cider
note
slipping
in
and
a
spiciness
that
i
am
not
accustomed
to
in
gueuze
but
i
like
it
quite
a
bit
overall
this
is
a
light
and
refreshing
beer
with
a
nice
complexity
and
a
hint
of
sweetness
to
balance
all
the
sourness
i
would
drink
this
again
nut
brown
color
cloudy
throughout
no
head
or
lacing
appears
mostly
flat
fruity
aroma
of
apple
raisins
and
a
hint
of
dark
cherry
earthy
and
powerful
nose
flavor
of
raisin
and
cherry
at
first
with
a
bit
of
tartness
turning
to
an
earthy
heavybodied
taste
with
a
bit
of
funk
underlying
the
rest
finishes
quite
sour
with
a
mouthpuckering
fruity
aftertaste
overall
more
fruity
and
tart
than
funky
or
earthy
still
a
nice
balanced
gueuze
overall
these
are
only
so
drinkable
well
balanced
and
tasty
for
the
style
taste
is
nice
as
well
but
the
funk
that
was
slightly
noticeable
in
the
aroma
isnt
there
medium
sour
with
some
lemon
and
lime
citrus
nice
and
light
bodied
high
carbonation
that
is
nice
for
the
style
solid
brew
very
enjoyable
golden
with
a
bit
of
red
slight
carbonation
sour
all
the
way
through
sour
fruit
nose
good
acidity
up
front
with
a
bit
of
bite
acidity
mild
but
noticeable
tart
middle
and
finish
light
mouthfeel
very
drinkable
the
balance
between
the
tartness
and
fruitiness
make
this
a
very
enjoyable
drink
overall
im
not
surprised
that
my
best
friend
has
been
getting
heavily
into
this
style
of
beer
lately
but
i
think
ill
stick
with
my
ipas
ryes
and
saisons
d
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
if
this
was
something
that
was
easier
to
get
i
be
drinking
this
semi
regularly
this
beer
is
worth
finding
to
try
solid
gueuze
sharp
on
the
tongue
and
interesting
d
a
thorough
pleasant
gueuze
certainly
doesnt
have
the
complexity
and
depth
of
the
better
gueuzes
but
there
are
no
off
flavors
or
characteristics
that
might
make
a
beer
unenjoyable
poured
a
hazy
tan
with
a
big
head
which
died
down
pretty
quickly
personally
i
dont
taste
the
sour
lemon
or
other
fruit
flavors
other
reviewers
stated
instead
what
the
smell
and
taste
both
remind
me
of
is
way
undercooked
hamburger
seriously
i
dont
doubt
this
is
probably
an
excellent
example
of
a
gueuze
lambic
but
it
just
doesnt
do
it
for
me
d
very
refreshing
and
drinkable
and
quite
refreshing
if
sours
are
your
thing
other
than
the
cider
though
theres
nothing
in
the
smell
or
taste
to
make
this
stand
out
as
any
other
than
a
good
classic
lambic
i
must
say
the
balanced
quality
of
this
gueze
was
exceptional
a
darker
pour
of
cloudy
orange
some
nice
head
that
stuck
around
for
a
bit
this
was
a
milder
sour
gueze
a
nice
sour
backed
with
oak
that
gives
it
an
earthy
blend
earth
is
backed
wtih
a
pollen
floral
and
a
honey
mild
that
isnt
over
powering
sweet
but
mellowing
very
nice
dimension
great
form
d
very
drinkable
as
a
fan
of
sourness
the
pleasant
dryness
of
this
geueze
leaves
me
craving
the
next
sip
a
very
nice
surprise
d
highly
drinkable
especially
for
the
abv
almost
too
sour
so
cant
have
a
super
high
drinkability
but
its
a
very
nice
example
of
the
style
really
trying
to
get
into
sours
figured
this
would
be
an
approach
but
not
to
crap
on
this
just
because
its
style
i
will
base
this
on
the
style
it
poures
a
deep
orange
with
a
sparsely
bubbly
head
taste
was
pretty
much
on
the
money
with
the
large
sourness
flavor
lemonheads
but
no
sweetness
prety
mouth
puckering
actually
found
this
to
be
pretty
drinkable
but
just
not
for
me
drinkability
overall
not
bad
a
bit
par
for
the
course
but
still
quite
refreshing
dont
drink
and
review
im
drinking
this
bottle
at
grinders
a
restaurant
in
kansas
city
i
ordered
a
cantillon
guezue
off
of
their
beer
menu
i
was
brought
this
bottle
which
wasnt
on
the
menu
instead
i
hadnt
tried
it
before
or
even
seen
it
on
store
shelves
in
the
area
so
i
decided
to
say
nothing
to
my
server
and
drink
it
while
it
pales
in
comparison
to
the
astounding
offering
from
cantillon
this
is
a
damn
good
guezue
on
its
own
right
definitely
try
it
d
very
drinkable
very
refreshing
gueuze
here
i
could
easily
drink
multiple
glasses
of
this
in
a
sitting
12
7
fl
oz
bottle
served
in
my
allagash
chalice
at
50
degrees
poured
an
exquisite
muted
goldenorange
with
a
fizzy
two
inch
creamcolored
head
that
sizzled
and
popped
and
quickly
receded
into
a
quarter
inch
cap
copious
tiny
bubbles
effervesced
in
solution
and
adhered
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
no
lacing
nose
reveals
tart
citrus
a
hint
of
cork
and
some
light
fruit
taste
follows
nose
however
the
tartness
and
citrus
somewhat
cancels
out
the
light
fruity
esters
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
with
a
lively
carbonation
and
a
fairly
dry
finish
a
very
solid
gueuze
not
overly
tart
however
having
just
had
this
ondraft
i
think
it
is
far
superior
in
the
bottle
d
very
tasty
goes
down
very
easily
not
filling
at
all
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
very
nice
sour
beer
that
is
worth
drinking
for
a
long
time
d
a
very
tart
but
enjoyable
beer
to
sip
on
d
very
much
enjoyed
this
one
nice
and
tartsour
fruit
and
lacto
balance
with
just
a
kiss
of
brett
funk
will
seek
it
out
again
for
sure
to
meet
my
sour
cravings
d
takes
a
bit
to
acclimate
to
the
tartness
at
least
for
those
just
getting
in
to
lambics
geuezes
and
wilds
but
once
you
do
it
is
rather
tasty
refreshing
and
worked
nicely
for
a
warm
new
england
day
bottle
poured
a
hazy
orangey
color
gueuze
with
a
large
frothy
head
with
excellent
retention
and
some
good
lacing
aroma
of
light
acidic
green
apples
with
some
subtle
oak
notes
is
better
then
i
had
anticipated
taste
is
overall
quite
tart
with
a
nice
touch
of
granny
smith
acidity
which
provide
a
great
refreshing
factor
oak
is
somewhat
subtle
with
limited
amount
of
funky
ester
body
is
quite
full
for
style
with
great
carbonation
i
was
expecting
a
sweeter
version
of
gueuze
based
on
what
i
tasted
previously
from
this
brewer
but
i
must
admit
to
being
pleasantly
surprised
draft
at
toronado
nice
dark
amber
color
with
a
small
white
cap
a
few
shades
darker
than
the
average
gueuze
the
aroma
is
interesting
big
apple
cider
character
along
with
a
bit
of
orange
juice
vinegar
and
pale
malt
very
little
bretty
funk
pretty
similar
on
the
palate
very
cidery
and
acetic
oranges
and
pears
light
tannins
and
a
hint
of
malt
decently
complex
but
quite
acetic
for
a
gueuze
almost
just
tastes
like
a
stale
apple
cider
not
terrible
but
i
cant
say
that
im
a
fan
overall
the
sour
is
great
aroma
very
intense
good
carbonation
ill
get
this
again
at
george
keeleys
if
its
still
there
on
my
next
visit
i
could
use
a
bit
more
carbonation
but
just
a
bit
other
than
that
it
was
a
nice
sour
that
really
hit
the
spot
tonight
overall
impression
a
real
tart
thirst
quencher
it
stays
funkaliscious
from
beginning
to
end
this
is
an
acquired
taste
one
that
i
have
acquired
d
d
i
really
enjoyed
this
and
i
find
the
drinkability
high
for
the
style
however
the
style
itself
carries
a
below
average
drinkability
in
my
opinion
pours
a
clear
peach
color
with
a
moderately
dissipating
thick
chunk
o
white
foamy
head
the
nose
is
quite
sour
with
generous
amounts
of
funk
lemon
cardamom
and
lime
the
taste
follows
pretty
closely
but
leans
more
toward
the
lemonylimey
side
of
citrus
indeed
healthy
doses
of
lemon
zest
cardamom
and
green
apple
along
with
a
very
subtle
hint
of
wheat
the
moderate
body
and
carbonation
and
light
bubbly
feel
make
for
a
fairly
drinkable
brew
d
a
decent
gueuze
thats
easy
to
find
but
nothing
all
that
special
i
would
stick
with
cantillon
hanssens
or
girardin
over
this
one
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
effervescent
overall
a
balanced
beer
with
some
excellent
qualities
to
it
the
only
thing
that
i
didnt
really
like
was
the
metal
or
something
at
the
backend
of
the
taste
a
good
example
of
the
style
mouthfeeldrinkability
alive
and
prickly
the
aggressively
effervescent
texture
keeps
the
intensely
dry
tart
character
moving
of
the
castle
brewery
offerings
ive
sampled
thus
far
i
crown
this
beer
king
opinion
well
this
may
sound
a
bit
silly
but
this
is
actually
a
pretty
tame
lambic
by
definition
though
it
has
the
acidity
the
rest
of
the
beer
subtly
plays
with
your
senses
rather
than
picking
them
and
smacking
them
around
if
you
are
not
sure
if
you
would
like
a
lambic
beer
i
would
give
this
one
a
shot
to
see
if
you
are
compatible
if
you
feel
yourself
like
i
do
wishing
that
your
palate
took
a
bit
more
punishment
i
would
go
for
the
cantillon
if
you
think
that
this
is
a
bit
much
you
may
want
to
stick
to
the
lindemans
either
way
this
is
a
respectable
beer
and
i
wouldnt
hesitate
to
recommend
it
drinkability
a
very
good
medium
level
sour
i
like
the
applelemon
flavor
i
could
drink
all
day
and
had
a
few
on
tap
at
julians
providence
poured
a
corked
and
caged
12
7oz
bottle
into
my
oversized
tripel
karmeliet
tulip
this
beer
pours
a
traditional
burnt
orange
with
a
two
inch
off
white
creamy
head
that
leaves
little
to
no
lacing
down
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
traditional
gueuze
there
is
a
nice
lactic
twang
in
the
nose
with
tannic
oak
green
apple
skins
and
good
old
fashion
funk
coming
from
the
brewery
that
produces
all
the
crap
that
st
louis
does
i
expect
much
more
sweetness
out
of
the
nose
while
there
is
a
hint
of
malt
sweetness
im
very
surprised
the
flavor
is
much
the
same
with
a
traditional
lactic
quality
that
lends
itself
to
grapefruit
pith
grape
skins
green
apples
and
lemon
zest
there
is
just
a
hint
of
residual
sweetness
that
follows
and
it
really
isnt
as
flavorful
as
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
the
mouthfeel
is
not
as
dry
as
i
would
have
liked
the
small
amount
of
residual
sugars
makes
it
just
a
bit
too
sweet
i
like
my
gueuzes
bone
dry
over
all
im
really
surprised
with
the
quality
of
this
beer
i
really
bought
it
because
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
a
horrible
example
of
the
style
by
a
brewery
that
is
known
for
bastardizing
belgian
styles
but
they
did
a
pretty
good
job
the
palate
opens
witha
combination
of
citrus
sweet
and
sour
flavors
with
a
definite
balsalmic
vinegar
character
some
sweetness
is
noticeable
too
the
midpalate
is
mildly
water
but
the
finish
is
long
drying
and
has
a
lemony
tartness
the
funk
character
is
quite
low
this
lightbodied
beer
has
a
mediumhigh
level
of
carbonation
quite
drinkable
this
is
a
good
cheap
gueuze
91100
points
drinkability
is
nice
seems
pretty
well
balanced
not
overly
acidic
or
sour
but
fairly
representative
of
the
style
the
metallic
and
higher
alcohol
characters
definitely
take
away
from
it
and
id
have
liked
a
little
more
depth
but
not
bad
overall
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
pretty
satisfying
and
easy
to
drink
much
better
than
the
usual
swill
st
louis
is
responsible
for
a
pretty
solid
and
relatively
cheap
gueuze
this
is
a
definite
funk
lovers
dream
it
isnt
too
bad
but
not
amazing
some
aspects
of
it
are
a
bit
too
rough
and
unrefined
it
isnt
as
smooth
or
drinkable
as
some
of
the
others
in
the
category
mouthfeel
was
medium
to
light
in
body
with
ultrafine
carbonation
slightly
puckering
up
front
with
a
subtle
barnyard
funk
character
that
is
not
too
overpowering
or
acidic
very
light
with
a
lot
of
crisp
golden
fruit
especially
apple
and
pear
and
slight
earthy
tartness
not
overly
sour
and
very
quaffable
this
is
well
balanced
with
a
nice
blend
of
lambics
making
it
pretty
easy
to
put
down
i
drank
this
very
quickly
and
while
it
was
very
refreshing
i
wished
that
it
was
a
bit
funkier
and
a
lot
more
sour
i
had
low
expectations
and
this
exceeded
them
drinkable
and
recommended
for
those
interested
in
gueuzes
but
fear
the
shock
of
unbridled
acidity
and
funk
clean
and
refreshing
nothing
spectacular
but
well
done
this
beer
is
a
little
bit
of
a
one
note
wonder
but
it
does
it
so
well
this
is
a
great
session
beer
for
sure
it
is
sour
and
tart
finishes
cleanly
a
complete
palate
cleansing
beer
no
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
between
low
and
medium
body
beer
goes
down
quick
and
simply
drinkability
really
high
i
enjoyed
the
simplicity
and
flavor
of
this
beer
d
not
so
bad
it
tastes
good
and
its
quite
sessionable
but
the
lack
of
finish
makes
it
less
interesting
for
me
d
f
all
those
who
dont
like
it
i
think
it
is
a
great
gueuze
taste
never
before
have
i
sipped
something
so
mouthrackingly
tart
and
tangy
an
out
of
control
puckering
assault
thats
totally
fun
not
so
much
funkiness
just
sweet
and
wonderful
full
rounded
tanginess
clean
fruity
acidity
d
easy
to
drink
average
gueze
the
gatorade
of
beer
according
to
one
of
the
tastings
panelists
very
refreshing
for
sure
like
something
youd
want
to
drink
while
playing
halfassed
backyard
football
not
something
i
want
to
sit
down
and
enjoy
if
i
have
other
options
but
i
cant
deny
that
the
taste
is
still
with
me
nearly
two
weeks
after
drinking
and
its
a
pleasant
mirage
d
a
nice
gueuze
it
doesnt
have
the
complexity
akin
to
a
cantillon
or
boon
but
its
a
traditional
version
and
a
good
stab
at
the
style
drinkability
is
good
mellow
and
mildly
sour
with
a
wonderfully
tart
finish
a
decent
gueuze
with
a
concentrated
profile
cheers
mputhfeeldrinkability
medium
bodied
with
a
nice
cleansing
carbonation
that
works
well
with
the
tartness
of
the
beer
with
the
slightly
higher
sweetness
the
drinkability
is
really
good
for
those
who
prefer
a
more
straightforward
gueuze
this
is
for
you
it
has
a
pale
orange
color
and
a
pleasant
nose
with
an
intense
sourness
the
taste
meanwhile
is
mostly
dominant
by
a
soapy
tasting
vinegar
sourness
with
canned
pears
syrup
notes
of
apples
skins
and
tart
pears
appear
though
this
gueuze
doesnt
transform
itself
into
a
brand
new
level
of
flavors
as
say
a
cantillon
still
good
to
drink
though
and
a
pleasant
enough
contrast
with
my
bbq
brisket
overall
solid
authentic
lambic
not
the
best
ever
but
a
good
crisp
natural
tart
flavor
the
way
they
should
be
mouth
is
wet
and
bubbly
champagne
like
highly
drinkable
if
you
enjoy
sours
but
i
imagine
it
can
be
grating
after
a
glass
or
two
a
very
drinkable
brew
but
not
anything
i
see
myself
craving
particularly
when
im
looking
for
a
bold
gueuze
that
said
its
a
great
introduction
to
the
style
although
if
memory
serves
i
actually
preferred
the
equally
accessible
lindemans
gueuze
although
that
was
sweeter
i
will
look
forward
to
the
opportunity
to
have
this
again
very
impressed
on
tap
at
the
publick
house
on
brookline
served
in
a
small
corsendonk
xmas
glass
bright
yellow
color
with
a
thin
white
head
medium
amount
of
carbonation
smell
was
quite
floral
and
peppery
very
tart
taste
which
was
what
i
was
expecting
not
very
complex
but
it
was
a
straight
forward
fine
gueuze
since
it
was
so
tart
this
is
not
a
beer
id
drink
all
night
but
it
went
fine
with
the
cuisine
at
the
publick
house
d
yes
this
was
especially
drinkable
especially
in
hopleafs
beer
garden
taste
is
nice
mix
of
sweet
and
sour
a
nice
tasty
gueze
hv
aroma
is
sharp
and
bitter
and
sour
as
hoped
for
flavor
follows
suit
with
green
apples
vinegary
salad
dressing
and
all
the
wonderful
oddities
that
make
a
gueuzelambic
such
a
wonderful
surprise
not
nearly
as
out
there
sharpharsh
as
cantillon
so
its
a
little
more
accessible
not
nearly
as
balanced
as
my
favorite
oud
beersel
but
still
a
decent
gueuze
and
when
its
the
only
one
i
can
easily
get
its
a
decent
choice
d
low
in
alcohol
and
high
in
taste
its
a
gueuze
so
it
is
not
the
most
sessionable
brew
out
therewith
all
the
acidity
a
few
of
these
would
do
damage
to
the
stomach
but
i
could
down
a
few
of
these
easily
if
i
had
some
tums
nearby
glad
i
got
to
try
this
on
tap
after
passing
it
up
in
the
bottle
for
years
its
pretty
humid
out
today
this
beer
is
really
hitting
the
spot
ill
probably
grab
another
after
this
and
move
on
to
something
else
before
i
leave
this
is
certainly
a
nice
treat
on
a
hot
summer
day
grab
a
hunk
of
fatty
soft
ripened
cheese
and
go
at
it
d
definitely
a
sipper
though
the
dry
finish
makes
it
pretty
quaffable
overall
this
is
a
beer
thats
on
the
sweet
side
of
gueuzes
but
without
adding
too
much
sweetness
definitely
worth
a
shot

and
a
ring
of
bubbles
around
the
perimeter
smells
like
gueze
sour
wheat
fruity
pebbles
taste
is
fleetingly
sour
weird
lemony
ok
but
not
my
favorite
gueuze
there
is
just
something
odd
about
this
one
that
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
i
enjoy
the
occasional
sour
ale
and
this
is
definitely
an
acquired
taste
its
still
quite
easy
to
drink
and
if
you
can
get
past
the
funkiness
of
it
you
should
be
able
to
enjoy
it
drinkability
i
found
this
pretty
darn
drinkable
for
the
style
its
not
a
style
that
i
drink
a
lot
of
of
but
i
could
really
enjoy
a
couple
glasses
of
this
in
the
summer
when
it
gets
hotter
notes
a
great
introduction
to
what
gueuze
should
taste
like
not
the
most
textured
example
but
a
really
tasty
beer
for
the
price
needs
food
and
beginners
should
prepare
themselves
for
how
sour
this
beer
is
have
to
wait
a
bit
i
just
met
her
and
besides
ive
broken
enough
hearts
and
mine
already
d
an
almost
sessionable
sour
very
good
taste
and
classic
presentation
i
would
find
this
a
nice
second
or
third
step
into
sour
beer
for
those
just
getting
started
or
seasoned
sour
beer
drinkers
may
find
this
one
as
a
welcomed
change
of
pace
from
some
of
todays
extreme
sour
offering
overall
a
nice
beer
but
nothing
to
rant
and
rave
about
good
stuff
glad
i
got
to
try
it
d
this
is
an
easy
drinking
geueze
could
easily
drink
another
of
these
even
with
the
sour
quotient
drinkability
a
very
good
beer
in
the
style
traditional
gueuze
i
really
liked
this
one
it
looks
like
slightly
dark
champagne
some
head
some
lacing
yellowgolden
liquid
the
smell
is
very
much
like
a
white
wine
with
vinous
and
acidic
qualities
there
are
also
some
sweet
lemon
notes
in
the
nose
the
flavor
is
complex
and
wonderful
it
is
tart
faintly
yogurty
with
a
dry
oaky
finish
there
are
also
notes
of
green
apple
and
lime
it
has
a
full
feel
with
a
nice
pucker
a
delicious
beer

i
enjoy
this
style
but
one
is
enough
per
sitting
i
found
this
to
be
quite
enjoyable
and
i
would
definitely
seek
it
out
again
d
this
comes
fairly
close
to
being
a
hit
it
looks
fine
smells
alright
and
feels
great
but
theres
just
something
a
little
off
in
the
taste
at
least
to
my
palate
and
thats
where
it
really
counts
it
does
seem
to
improve
with
a
little
time
out
of
the
bottle
good
effort
nonetheless
and
id
be
happy
to
try
it
again
pours
a
pale
hazy
golden
with
a
fairly
faint
head
that
settles
to
a
ring
smells
acetic
and
funky
with
some
lemon
sour
orange
barnyard
and
some
hay
notes
at
the
end
the
taste
is
still
quite
sour
but
a
bit
simpler
mostly
losing
the
funky
notes
and
concentrating
on
lemon
clean
hay
and
a
bit
of
medicinal
almost
bandaid
flavor
but
luckily
not
quite
that
far
decent
sharp
in
the
mouth
at
first
but
it
lightens
up
and
even
becomes
a
bit
creamy
at
the
end
at
least
this
beer
tastes
real
and
isnt
loaded
with
sugar
like
so
many
of
their
beers
not
bad
at
all
a
good
and
refreshing
lambic
a
little
pricey
to
drink
regularly
unfortunately
a
bit
pricey
but
good
not
much
of
the
funk
but
quite
tart
and
impressive
good
gueueze
2009
trying
this
again
at
home
theres
a
definite
acetic
flavor
in
this
reminiscent
of
horseradish
mustard
the
seeded
kind
not
the
yellow
hot
dog
stuff
huge
puffy
head
almost
a
barnacled
sea
plank
saltiness
too
strange
not
so
puckering
a
manageable
introductory
gueuze
this
beer
is
wellcarbonated
but
not
roughly
so
finish
is
pretty
dry
leaving
just
a
bit
of
stickiness
as
the
mouth
attempts
to
recover
from
the
acidity
drinkability
is
pretty
high
but
overall
it
lacks
some
complexity
not
the
most
complex
but
certainly
drinkable
price
was
cheaper
than
several
of
the
other
gueuzes
overall
score
bumped
up
a
half
point
since
the
taste
score
should
be
a
tad
higher

subtle

bad
beer
but
not
what
ill
be
going
to
for
a

a
good
unique
taste
that
i
cant
quite
describe
through
the
middle
that
i
have
not
found
in
other
geueze
mouthfeel
is
excellent
and
drinkability
is
quite
good
for
the
style
one
i
would
revisit
but
i
will
take
some
others
before
this
defenitely
a
good
one
tho
not
a
style
i
have
learned
to
appreciate
yet
hence
my
average
drinkability
rating
but
theres
no
denying
that
this
is
a
wellcrafted
beer
that
probably
turned
out
exactly
as
intended
this
was
a
suprisingly
good
gueuze
and
it
paired
my
beer
mussels
amazingly
well
this
is
actually
much
better
than
i
was
expecting
i
was
expecting
something
that
was
at
least
leaning
towards
sweet
it
has
some
residual
sweetness
but
only
a
faint
hint
when
compared
to
a
perhaps
more
traditional
gueuze
or
fake
this
could
certainly
use
a
bit
more
funkiness
as
it
is
a
bit
on
the
soft
side
in
this
department
recommended
though
im
told
there
are
much
better
examples
of
the
style

another
of

ill
have
to
try
it
again
to
see
if
the
unusually

was
an
anomoly

not
pretty
good
lambic
sour
tart
and
dry
as
they
should
be
but
it
is
not

overwhelming
and
is
a

less
complicated
than
the
better
examples
there
standard
gueuze
was
way
to
sweet
this
was
nicely
dry
with
some
traditional
lambic
stinkyness
and
grassy
citrus
and
wood
flavours
close
to
the
real
thing
i
think
very
appetising

a

notes
and
green

body
is
full
enough
for
style
with
good
carbonation
for
an
8
year
old
bottle
good
balanced
between
complex
flavours
and
good
drinkability
with
limited
acidity
level
which
i
appreciated
mouth
is
lighter

but
typical
big
acidic
bite
nice
carb
for
the
age
serving
type
bottle
overall
artful
a
joy
to
drink
overall
really
good
geuze
similar
funk
to
3f
only
less
sour
worth
picking
up
if
you
can
find
it
its
one
of
the
better
geuzes
out
there
overall
excellent
without
being
all
that
dynamic
missing
some
of
the
sour
and
malt
characteristics
that
would
allow
this
to
transcend
other
gueuzes
beer
is
mediumlight
to
light
in
body
with
carbonation
of
high
intensity
resulting
in
a
mouthfeel
that
is
at
first
closes
dry
and
slightly
puckering
with
light
stickiness
coating
the
palate
and
lips
o
a
really
nice
gueuze
i
would
certainly
drink
this
regularly
if
it
was
easier
to
find
in
the
us
o
this
gueuze
is
less
extreme
than
cantillon
or
3f
similar
to
tilquin
but
with
less
lacto
not
complaints
easy
to
drink
with
moderate
acidity
for
the
style
it
tastes
different
than
the
three
mentioned
more
reserved
less
funky
has
a
maltier
aroma
and
has
a
nicely
balanced
elegant
flavor
overall
a
really
pleasant
oude
geuze
to
drink
light
and
airy
yet
subtly
complex
the
whole
beer
is
so
well
integrated
in
taste
body
and
carbonationnothing
is
out
of
place
and
the
flavors
sit
on
a
mousse
of
carbonation
another
example
of
a
geuze
as
good

some
fine

awesome
stuff
here
drinks
like
a
dream
would
welcome
this
gladly
anytime
o
a
pleasant
drinkable
lambic
however
it
isnt
of
the
best
in
its
category
its
balance
is
hampered
by
not
enough
acidity
and
too
much
yeastiness
comparable
to
lindemands

in

all
that
i

is

here
taste
has
more
hay
grass
and
light
tart
lemon
earthy
and
dirty
medium

lightmedium
tartness
hella
refreshing
an
amazing
gueuze
o
the
mineral
character
and
and
the
presence
of
some
pleasant
malt
sweetness
make
this
geuze
unique
and
its
eminently
drinkable
i
would
have
liked
a
bit
more
funk
but
besides
that
this
is
a
delicious
geuze
i
wish
we
had
better
access
to
this
in
the
us
has
a
crisp
tingly
carbonation
the
light
bodied
brew
washes
away
fast
dry
like
a
champagne
o
a
tasty
beer
i
like
champagne
lambics
sours
and
i
liked
drinking
this
geuze
the
low
alcohol
makes
it
fairly
sessionable
and
the
flavors
are
approachable
i
think
this
would
taste
good
with
a
flat
bread
pizza
fish
chicken
or
light
pasta
dish
would
be
good
with
fruit
and
cheese
plate
as
well
overall
definitely
on
the
more
acidic
and
vinegary
side
of
the
spectrum
but
not
as
much
so
as
the
tilquin
gueuze
this
one
had
lots
of
tart
fruity
esters
and
white
wine
notes
worked
well
with
the
acidic
component
this
was
probably
my
top
choice
out
of
the
lineup
and
id
most
likely
really
enoy
a
bottle
myself
i
used
a
little
bit
of
this
in
my
tilquin
cantillon
blend
which
worked
out
really
nicely
as
well
o
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
great
gueuze
its
super
funky
which
i
love
tons
of
funk
and
cheese
to
it
especially
in
the
nose
one
of
the
funkiest
smelling
gueuzes
ive
had
would
love
to
have
it
again
this
is
one
hell
of
a
gueuze
de
cam
beers
are
awesome
thanks
again
jeffo
tis
one
pours
a
light
bodied
bright
polished
gold
in
color
with
no
head
but
visible
carbonation
the
nose
is
super
funky
with
a
bunch
of
hay
horse
piss
sharp
a
acidity
and
wet
grass
it
has
some
stank
the
flavors
are
very
sour
acidic
earthy
with
loads
of
barnyard
and
horse
blanket
the
mouthfeel
is
light
probably
mostly
due
to
age
which
makes
this
drink
like
an
unblinded
or
draft
lambic
great
flavor
and
far
too
easy
to
drink
this
one
was
a
gem
classy
gueuze
with
a
near
perfect
nose
and
a
much
more
raw
flavour
profile
the
green
capsicum
character
virtually
imprints
itself
on
the
cerebral
cortex
similar
to
but
better
than
mamouche
in
my
view
o
really
nice
gueuze
had
no
problem
downing
this
bottle
great
level
of
tartness
not
overly
sour
even
though
i
love
them
sour
but
very
balanced
o
i
have
to
say
very
impressive
being
over
10
years
old
this
is
drinking
perfectly
at
the
moment
if
anyone
has
a
bottle
with
this
kind
of
age
on
it
id
suggest
drinking
it
now
recommend
o
very
interesting
to
try
a
gueuze
so
different
from
the
others
ive
encountered
personally
id
place
it
above
cantillon
and
below
3f
375

vintage
the
cork
shot
out
as
soon
as
the
cage
was
released
pours
a
hazy
golden
amber
with
a
small
white
head
that
has
good
retention
and
leaves
a
decent
amount
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
has
a
strong
mineral
note
there
is
also
quite
a
bit
of
funk
lemon
light
apricot
and
some
pear
the
taste
is
apricot
pear
some
light
lemon
a
bit
mineral
and
a
light
tartness
the
finish
has
a
distinct
mineral
note
light
bodied
with
mediumhigh
carbonation
o
smells
better
than
it
tastes
maybe
it
needs
age
but
just
average
at
this
point
this
has
been
the
first
bottle
i
have
opened
so
far
where
the
cork
shoots
out
with
the
cage
intact
after
i
only
have
loosened
the
cage
itself
pours
a
clear
golden
yellow
with
a
massive
4
inch
fizzy
bone
colored
head
that
settles
to
a
thin
cap
on
top
of
the
beer
lots
of
tiny
bubbles
are
active
in
the
beer
itself
after
the
pour
small
dots
and
chunks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
when
i
stick
my
nose
into
the
glass
and
take
a
whiff
i
am
met
with
an
intense
blast
of
funk
that
tingled
and
burned
my
nose
and
made
the
hair
on
my
face
stand
on
end
i
am
also
getting
very
sour
tart
woody
and
earthy
aromas
definitely
one
of
the
funkiest
gueuzes
i
have
ever
smelled
taste
is
of
funk
lemony
sournesstartness
grain
and
some
slightly
woody
flavors
there
is
an
acidic
tingle
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
very
high
level
of
carbonation
with
an
extremely
crisp
and
prickly
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
great
gueuze
and
probably
the
best
one
i
have
tried
thus
far
in
my
beer
tasting
journey
o
very
tasty
geuze
after
the
initial
sour
burst
a
nice
balance
of
sour
and
funky
overall
my
first
de
cam
very
impressive
o
what
a
great
gueuze
different
but
special
glad
i
have
2
more
excited
to
age
this
to
see
if
the
taste
begins
to
become
layered
solid
citrus
flavor
with
an
interesting
more
lactic
funk
than
other
gueuzes
glad
i
finally
got
to
try
this
one
had
to
actually
order
it
from
one
of
the
belgian
sites
might
have
to
get
some
more
of
it
in
my
next
order
its
pretty
different
overall
a
incredibly
unique
gueze
that
would
only
continue
to
mature
with
age
top
notch
at
this
juncture
and
one
of
the
best
guezes
ive
had
overall
this
is
just
a
great
example
of
a
sour
gueuze
very
enjoyable
overall
this
is
one
excellent
gueuze
wish
i
had
more
this
beer
is
fantastic
it
is
very
crisp
and
dry
with
lively
carbonation
the
beer
is
a
little
sweet
at
first
but
the
funky
develops
to
give
off
lots
and
lots
of
bretty
barnyard
combo
of
musty
straw
and
horse
pee
there
is
a
lot
of
puckering
lemon
and
bright
orange
zest
i
immensely
enjoyed
this
beer
and
would
say
this
is
one
of
the
best
examples
of
gueuze
ive
ever
had
this
one
was
shared
by
beeruser
with
funkydelic
staywhatyouare2
67couple
others
and
myself
at
a
recent
tasting
graciously
hosted
by
beeruser
2009
vintage
served
from
bottle
into
a
duvel
parra
tulip
poured
a
hazy
golden
yellow
with
a
minimal
white
head
maintained
decent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
subtle
sour
funk
and
bell
pepper
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
bell
pepper
funk
and
slight
sour
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
high
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
good
brew
bell
pepper
eh
that
is
a
new
one
for
me
in
a
beer
however
it
really
wasnt
that
bad
in
this
one
and
actually
helped
bring
out
the
subtle
sourness
i
picked
up
on
this
brew
was
very
easy
drinking
and
enjoyable
i
would
love
to
try
one
of
these
with
a
good
bit
of
age
on
it
to
see
how
it
develops
over
time
a
definite
must
try
even
if
it
is
just
to
try
and
taste
the
bell
pepper
notes
i
got
on
it
really
enjoyable
not
necessarily
better
than
the
options
available
stateside
but
worth
a
hearty
tick
good
light
body
with
lively
carbonation
here
pretty
solid
gueze
here
one
id
love
to
have
more
of
my
pour
looks
great
much
to
the
surprise
of
the
other
gents
who
had
a
quite
different
experience
golden
hued
with
a
finger
of
off
white
head
that
stuck
around
for
a
few
minutes
before
leaving
some
sparse
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
offers
wonderful
barnyard
funk
hay
light
citrus
and
oak
great
flavor
bringing
everything
i
found
in
the
aroma
together
quite
nicely
the
body
is
fairly
thin
with
low
carbonation
overall
a
very
tasty
beer
i
seem
to
have
enjoyed
this
quite
a
bit
more
than
my
counterparts
i
would
definitely
have
this
again
into
a
tulip
it
was
a
light
orange
brown
with
a
very
nice
three
finger
head
of
lace
and
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
streaming
up
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
nice
retention
only
gradually
let
the
head
fade
away
what
was
left
was
a
very
nice
set
of
concentric
side
glass
rings
of
lace
smell
was
very
sour
lots
of
grapes
and
other
fruits
a
bit
light
on
the
nose
before
the
sour
wrath
kicks
in
flavor
was
very
full
and
robust
nice
yeast
filled
flavor
wrecks
your
taste
buds
but
calms
down
considerably
on
the
finish
a
huge
rush
of
sour
fruit
than
kicks
into
overdrive
and
puckers
your
lips
through
the
finish
this
was
a
wonderfully
unique
brew
that
had
a
very
good
flavor
and
a
light
fruity
feel
phenomenal
throughout
this
geuze
hits
on
all
cylinders
very
wellrounded
and
clean
this
ranks
up
there
with
some
of
my
favorites
in
the
style
this
is
medium
to
light
bodied
with
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
the
alcohol
presents
itself
with
a
slight
warmth
down
the
back
of
the
throat
such
a
nice
arrangement
of
enjoyable
flavors
and
aromas
this
was
a
fantastic
brew
to
sip
on
i
need
more
as
a
second
glass
is
poured
more
character
of
cheese
comes
out
in
aroma
and
flavor
with
a
nice
woodsy
dryness
that
was
not
evident
before
the
finish
gets
more
drying
as
it
comes
up
to
room
temperature
previously
hidden
notes
of
grass
and
light
bubblegum
come
forward
adding
a
strange
twist
to
this
brew
fantastic
stuff
cheers
i
had
heard
reports
of
potato
notes
as
well
as
red
peppers
but
i
tasted
none
of
that
this
was
a
375ml
of
the
2009
vintage
the
head
on
this
was
amazing
so
huge
and
unyielding
bigger
than
any
gueuze
ive
seen
the
aroma
was
sour
citrus
and
mild
funk
the
flavor
was
good
sour
lemons
very
refreshing
overall
this
was
a
great
gueuze
its
really
a
shame
that
we
cant
buy
this
in
the
u
s
because
id
drop
some
cash
on
it
as
it
is
i
really
cant
because
shipping
from
belgium
is
just
too
much
this
reminded
me
more
of
a
3f
than
say
cantillon
beer
is
thin
and
bright
on
the
palate
with
a
mildly
dry
finish
overall
it
is
a
decent
gueuze
the
sourness
comes
through
on
the
palate
well
and
the
feeling
is
really
nice
i
enjoyed
it
and
i
would
have
it
again
but
i
wished
for
a
carbonated
beverage
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
very
head
and
zero
lacing
a
good
swirl
or
two
brings
nothing
back
up
and
subsequent
hard
pours
didnt
fare
much
better
the
nose
brought
plenty
of
earthy
barnyard
and
funk
with
some
oak
in
the
background
the
flavor
layered
the
funk
quite
well
nice
hay
and
earth
and
a
dry
finish
that
was
quite
smooth
light
body
and
very
little
carbonation
a
pretty
good
example
of
the
style
overall
great
overall
a
nice
geuze
a
bit
too
watery
for
my
liking
though
is
also
missing
the
balance
that
is
so
clearly
present
in
cantillon
and
3
fonteinen
geuzes
still
very
very
worth
trying
od
smoother
than
a
lambic
a
feature
i
quite
like
about
geuzes
nice
and
grapey
not
a
bad
one
bottled
in
2009
pours
a
clear
orange
gold
with
a
medium
head
that
settles
into
a
thin
cap
nose
is
lush
juicy
kind
of
a
very
brettforward
melon
type
nose
or
something
definitely
more
brett
heavy
than
most
belgian
lambics
i
believe
quite
sour
upfront
really
high
carbonation
which
i
enjoy
still
really
bretty
throughout
kind
of
eggy
sweaty
brett
citrus
fruits
light
fruits
a
touch
of
white
grape
perhaps
in
fact
it
reminds
me
of
cuvee
de
castleton
a
little
bit
which
is
odd
as
i
rarely
compare
genuine
belgian
lambics
to
american
sours
acidity
creeps
up
a
bit
in
the
finish
i
can
see
how
the
components
of
this
might
play
a
role
in
the
3
fonteinen
blends
but
im
not
sure
the
really
high
carbonation
works
well
with
the
overly
brettforward
elements
of
this
i
prefer
the
drier
more
mineralforward
3
fonteinen
blends
this
is
somewhat
like
girardin
black
but
the
funk
and
yeast
in
the
girardin
is
tighter
and
to
me
this
just
doesnt
pop
how
i
wanted
dinsanely
balanced
with
great
fruity
sweetness
and
juicy
but
awesome
funk
to
it
making
it
extremely
complex
o
good
lambic
all
around
but
could
have
used
a
little
bit
more
of
each
of
its
traits
drinkability
and
overall
impression
i
found
that
each
sip
followed
the
last
one
easily
and
almost
without
thought
by
the
time
lunch
was
served
id
finished
well
over
half
of
it
it
also
turned
out
to
be
a
surprising
good
companion
to
the
beef
stew
i
was
having
ill
certainly
be
happy
to
have
this
again
and
i
wouldnt
mind
seeing
what
a
few
years
of
age
do
with
this
beer
my
overall
impression
is
that
this
is
a
very
good
beer
very
different
than
the
cantillon
but
very
good
in
its
own
right
this
beer
demonstrated
to
me
that
when
it
comes
to
lambics
and
geuze
it
is
the
wild
yeast
and
their
companion
bacteria
that
make
up
the
terroir
of
the
beer
tart
puckering
medium
body
with
lots
of
sour
barnyard
funk
without
beng
acetc
or
acdic
at
all
intensely
puckering
but
clean
with
lots
of
earthy
funk
and
sourness
without
being
harsh
or
abrasive
slight
light
fruit
presence
with
hints
of
apple
and
pear
and
a
nice
vinegarvinaigrette
flavor
at
the
end
of
the
swallow
that
leaves
me
drooling
for
more
i
cant
believe
that
this
beer
can
be
so
complex
funky
and
drinkable
all
at
the
same
time
some
sourslambicsgueuze
can
become
a
bit
much
after
a
while
but
i
could
drink
this
beer
all
night
amazing
the
beer
had
a
lot
of
carbonation
it
fizzed
on
my
tongue
like
pop
but
with
a
silkier
body
very
easy
to
finish
the
bottle
it
was
gone
in
no
time
as
was
the
meal
overall
this
is
another
high
class
beer
coming
from
the
fields
of
belgium
however
my
rating
is
slightly
lower
than
it
should
be
because
of
rating
to
style
d
i
dont
know
if
this
is
rare
or
what
i
have
never
seen
it
save
for
today
in
the
possession
of
an
awesome
and
generous
totally
random
bar
patron
i
want
more
d
a
surefire
stand
out
that
makes
a
good
argument
for
being
the
best
standard
gueuze
drinkability
glad
we
shared
it
probably
one
of
my
least
favorite
gueuze
right
up
there
with
cantillon
as
a
classic
example
of
traditional
lambicgueuze
unique
in
its
own
right
with
pronounced
dry
oak
and
citrusy
fruit
notes
maybe
the
best
geuze
ive
ever
had
its
been
almost
a
year
since
i
had
this
last
but
its
still
my
favorite
of
all
the
gueuze
blenders
yum
facemeltingly
sour
this
geuze
is
im
getting
kind
of
sweaty
just
remembering
the
hurt
laid
out
on
my
palate
brutal
but
in
a
good
way
lots
of
tannic
wood
and
funky
earth
pulls
through
as
it
warms
mouthfeel
is
frothy
in
its
carbonation
while
the
thin
body
dries
the
tongue
with
each
sip
for
me
gueze
de
cam
stole
the
sour
category
at
our
tasting
even
with
the
likes
of
blauw
ddg
and
bullfrog
magic
beans
in
attendance
a
beer
to
savor
thanks
again
for
sharing
this
one
mike
id
forgotten
how
sour
this
beer
is
bracingly
so
with
a
strong
lemon
and
grapefruit
pith
sourness
theres
plenty
of
citric
and
some
lactic
acid
definitely
some
yogurt
at
a
level
where
it
hinders
drinkability
and
the
complexity
of
the
nose
the
funk
is
rather
obliterated
by
the
sourness
on
the
bright
side
so
is
the
sulfur
bitter
grapefruit
pith
on
the
finish
this
beer
is
highly
carbonated
and
is
a
demonstration
in
sourness
moderate
wood
tannins
with
vanilla
and
wet
oak
are
present
solid
stuff
but
too
sour
to
make
a
session
gueuze
like
say
girardin
or
drie
fonteinen

the
taste
opens
with
a
sharp
lemonlike
flavor
both
bitter
rind
and
sour
juice
woody
and
earthyfunky
flavors
come
out
more
as
it
breathes
lactic
sourness
is
dominant
with
only
a
trace
of
acetic
acid
finishes
tannic
and
oaky
with
some
lactic
slickness
sticking
to
the
tongue
very
enjoyable
but
not
quite
stellar
the
beer
improved
as
it
sat
in
the
glass
and
warmed
finally
cracked
open
a
bottle
i
bought
last
year
in
ghent
i
also
finally
noticed
the
bottle
date
was
from
2000
so
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
here
i
think
the
beer
was
a
little
past
its
prime
as
it
wasnt
bursting
with
complexity
instead
it
had
smoothed
out
a
bit
frankly
this
just
helped
me
drink
more
of
it
so
im
not
complaining
a
lot
of
great
gueuze
will
be
bursting
with
flavor
but
the
sourness
really
hurts
drinkability
so
with
this
more
subtle
for
the
style
tartness
the
beer
is
still
full
of
the
trademark
tangy
lemon
citrus
rind
and
farmhouse
character
it
just
doesnt
beat
you
over
the
head
with
any
of
them
i
certainly
wouldnt
mind
drinking
this
beer
again
drinkability
mouthfeel
hurts
it
a
bit
and
the
flavor
profile
isnt
to
my
liking
but
this
one
is
still
pretty
drinkable
mouthfeel
was
prickly
with
a
medium
body
finishes
a
bit
deflated

mmmmm
a

taste
is
very
dry
with
a

finish
tastes
of
dried
fruit
with
a
malty
note
and
a
nice
blended
flavor
that
doesnt
do
anything
too
suddennly
the
mouthfeel

utterly
without

a
good

all
in

d
my

and
i
drank
the
750ml
bottle
with
no
problems
the
abv
is
low
the
carbonation
is
right
on
and
the
taste
is
terrific
the
aftertaste
gets
a
little
palatebusting
but
thats
a
minor
complaint
drinkability
some
may
consider
it
somewhat
tame
but
its
still
a
very
tasty
very
satisfying
brew
a
sour
lemony
aroma
with
only
a
hint
of
mustiness
to
it
there
is
a
definite
sharp
acidity
to
it
that
i
would
say
is
on
the
hard
side
for
the
traditional
geuze
blenders
the
carbonation
is
lively
and
seems
to
enhance
the
acidity
taste
low
end
carbonation
pushes
the
acidity
to
good
levels
but
without
getting
too
astringent
or
burning
this
is

all
i
wanted
to
do
when
i
finished
it
the
body
is
medium
soft
at
times
before
asserting
a
notquitegrainy
sort
of
dryness
on
the
palate
it
gets
pretty
creamy
into
the
middle
before
an
alcoholic
edge
cuts
it
it
finishes
dry
and
lingers
with
tangy
and
leafy
textures
o
overall
a
decent
beer
but
compared
to
the
other
gueuzes
on
tap
this
one
didnt
stack
up
some
nice
funk
in
the
nose
but
the
taste
is
sweeter
and
milder
would
have
it
again
but
not
my
favorite
gueuze
overall
this
beer
has
some
mixed
reviews
on
this
website
but
i
personally
love
it
if
it
were
a
little
bit
easier
to
find
not
to
mention
not
so
expensive
i
would
love
to
have
this
on
a
regular
basis
kudos
this
was
more
of
an
average
tripel
with
a
unique
twist
nothing
overly
special
just
a
unique
combination
if
there
were
awards
for
oddball
beers
this
would
certainly
be
a
contender
the
aroma
has
a
fruity
spicy
complexity
that
bodes
well
but
is
let
down
by
the
messy
flavour
it
has
a
winelike
quality
that
is
much
more
fruity
than
a
typical
gueuze
which
i
would
expect
to
be
dry
and
lemony
from
the
taste
its
hard
to
pinpoint
what
this
is
supposed
to
be
a
beery
lambic
a
sour
tripel
it
seems
to
shoot
for
too
many
targets
and
misses
them
all
an
interesting
effort
certainly
but
it
lacks
purpose
im
glad
i
had
the
chance
to
try
it
but
this
is
probably
a
first
and
last
time
for
me
a
berliner
weiss
i
do
not
know
smooth
mouthfeel
and
decent
drinkability
this
beer
pours
a
light
bodied
and
crystal
clear
polished
bright
gold
in
color
with
a
frothy
two
finger
bright
white
head
the
nose
is
light
and
yeasty
with
a
definitive
tripel
backbone
it
does
have
some
slight
brett
but
definitely
is
short
in
the
lambic
department
it
is
slightly
lemony
however
the
flavors
are
very
light
and
feature
typical
belgian
yeast
with
a
slight
lemon
zest
aspect
perhaps
lemongrass
and
a
very
light
tartness
its
ok
just
isnt
really
dominant
in
one
phase
or
another
the
lemon
grass
does
increase
as
it
warms
this
one
is
alright
not
worth
18
99
but
its
drinkable
pours
a
hazy
orange
with
a
foamy
bone
colored
head
that
settles
to

down
smell
is
sour
tart

funky
with
some

acidic

and
spice

taste
is
much
the
same
with
an
emphasis
on
the
gueuze
flavors
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
but
the
gueuze
overpowers
the
tripel
in
both
the
aroma
and
flavor
in
my
opinion
pours
a
hazed
golden
orange
with
a
white
head
a
very
musty
aroma
to
this
damp
oak
funk
and
barnyard
a
touch
of
sweet
banana
and
bubblegum
sweet
sugar
straw
and
yeast
all
over
the
place
the
flavor
is
just
as
disjointed
musty
funk
barnyard
straw
and
some
oak
to
go
with
the
sweetness
of
the
tripel
banana
bubblegum
and
a
hint
of
cotton
candy
light
citrus
and
some
mild
tartness
would
be
interesting
to
see
how
this
is
with
some
more
time
in
the
bottle
the
sourness
didnt
really
stick
out
on
the
taste
but
the
finish
was
on
the
dry
side
wasnt
fully
sure
what
to
make
of
the
hybrid
but
it
was
a
good

beer
is

resultant

never

perhaps
could
use
a

more
carbonation
to
move
this

the

ba
classifies
this
beer
as
a
gueuze
in
that
regard
this
beer
falls
short
however
the
description
on
the
menu
was
of
a
gueuzetripel
blend
which
i
found
to
be
spot
on
this
beer
is
an
interesting
montage
of
malty
tart
and
fruity
and
is
worth
trying
but
dont
expect
a
gueuze
well
worth
your
time
if
you
have
the
opportunity
to
try
this
beer
beer
is
light
in
body
and
easy
drinking
the
sourness
is
light
though
and
this
is
not
a
very
good
gueuze
or
a
very
good
tripel
oops
not
a
repeat
for
me
this
beer
has
a
nice
big
white
fluffy
head
mildly
hazy
golden
color
leaves
some
nice
lacing
aroma
is
a
bit
subdued
some
spicy
character
some
nice
funk
but
really
not
special
flavor
is
nicer
more
funk
citrus
rind
not
enough
tartness
there
is
almost
a
saison
like
character
to
this
beer
which
adds
a
nice
spice
mouthfeel
has
good
carbonation
but
could
be
a
bit
lighter
and
more
lively
overall
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
one
i
would
not
revisit
this
beer
whatever
you
call
this
beer
it
was
very
good
and
i
would
highly
recommend
it
if
you
can
find
it
o
an
interesting
experiment
but
not
one
i
will
be
seeking
out
again
stick
to
examples
of
the
individual
styles
jd
overall
this
is
kind
of
an
unfortunate
amalgamation
of
two
of
my
favorite
styles
instead
of
forming
some
brilliant
combination
of
sweet
belgian
spice
and
tart
it
fruitlessly
pulls
equally
hard
in
too
many
directions
resulting
in
a
beer
that
doesnt
have
much
of
anything
interesting
going
on
i
ended
up
enjoying
this
by
the
end
of
the
glass
and
im
glad
i
ordered
it
its
more
interesting
than
fantastic
which
perhaps
means
it
did
not
succeed
ill
have
it
again
but
its
not
going
to
be
a
favorite
of
mine
o
kinda
like
this
one
a
really
good
gateway
to
the
world
of
belgian
sours
the
blend
might
take
a
bit
from
both
styles
but
i
find
it
very
enjoyable
delicious
throughout
the
beer
finally
rests
as
a
very
characterful
belgian
pale
ale
where
the
honeyish
tone
becomes
the
main
line
throughout
and
then
with
the
much
welcomed
complexity
of
pungent
must
and
tartness
a
wouldbe
delcious
complementary
to
shellfish
of
any
kind
overall
nice
experiment
still
i
feel
this
blend
is
destroying
the
nice
flavors
of
the
girardin
geuze

a
frothy
white

that
is
setting
up
to

like
an
old
woman
from

the
sour
apricot
smell
is
evident
immediately
upon
the

i
dont
have
to
get
near
it
doing
so
however
brings
out
more
citrus
hay
and
chocolate
this
is
literally
making
my
mouth
water
the
taste
is
freakin
fantastic
just
as
the
smell
advertises
much
more
mellow
than
i
imagined
sour
fruit
dried
hay
sort
of
a
mild
chocolate
and
nutmeg
thing
going
on
something
that
dings
the
champagne
bell
in
my
head
a
dry
finish
and
a
very
balanced
very
smooth
very
nice
beer
wow
pale
ale
tripelgueze
whatever
it
is
i
wish
i
had
ordered
a
case
of
this
stuff
it
is
sharply
carbonated
with
an
overall
silkiness
that
holds
it
together
and
leads
to
the
kicka
lacing
seriously
i
dont
know
if
it
is
the
obvious
aging
on
this
sample
what
this
style
really
is
or
how
much
they
brewed
but
get
thee
hence
and
get
some
youll
thank
me
you
can
repay
me
in
vicardin
this
is
an
interesting
blend
it
is
really
nice
to
try
but
i
am
pretty
sure
i
would
prefer
either
an
authentic
gueuze
or
tripel
over
this
in
the
end
somehow
this
seems
almost
too
well
balanced
between
the
tripel
and
the
gueuze
character
purchased
from
bier
temple
brussels
pours
a
copper
gold
hue
into
a
flute
glass
with
a
two
finger
white
fizzy
head
that
dissipates
fairly
quickly
leaving
a
centimeter
of
foam
and
nice
lacing
smell
is
strawish
and
geueze
like
taste
is
bitter
and
champagne
like
musty
with
nice
lambic
flavors
but
hoppier
and
with
a
lingering
bitterness
not
as
spritzy
and
lively
as
a
pure
lambic
but
very
dry
on
the
palate
not
exceedingly
drinkable
but
a
great
sipper
very
special
bottle
poured
a
hazy
orangey
color
ale
with
a
large
foamy
head
with
great
retention
and
some
very
good
lacing
aroma
of
light
tart
notes
mix
with
some
bland
belgian
ale
is
interesting
though
not
as
powerful
as
i
was
expecting
considering
some
girardin
had
been
used
to
assemble
this
beer
taste
is
also
a
very
refreshing
mix
between
some
tart
and
sour
notes
with
light
green
apples
notes
and
some
typical
belgian
ale
malt
backbone
body
is
fuller
then
average
with
limited
filtration
and
great
carbonation
well
mix
overall
with
a
refreshing
taste
though
i
was
expecting
a
bit
more
from
the
lambic
md
the
tart
and
tannic
edge
of
geuze
on
top
of
light
effervescence
helps
retain
a
very
refreshing
and
surprisingly
clean
palate
while
the
mixed
flavour
of
triple
and
geuze
also
ensures
a
lighter
body
that
is
fit
for
a
thirstquenching
ale
all
in
all
this
bottle
is
a
very
intriguing
experiment
and
a
quite
successful
one
i
must
say
some
bigger
expectation
here
hence
de
koninck
geuze
is
the
airplane
food
equivalent
of
the
style
i
appreciate
any
efforts
at
reviving
and
popularizing
lambic
but
products
this
bad
are
not
doing
the
style
nor
its
potential
consumers
any
favours
this
brewery
makes
a
reasonably
good
mainstream
belgian
ale
and
they
should
stick
to
that
brew
lambics
traditionally
or
leave
the
tradition
to
the
real
lambic
brewers
de
koninck
gueuze
is
not
a
superstar
in
the
world
of
sour
ales
it
is
however
a
workable
option
during
the
late
afternoon
beer
is
mediumlight
in
body
with
mediumhigh
to
high
carbonation
levels
resulting
in
a
strong
fizziness
that
quickly
foams
the
beer
on
the
palate
you
first
feel
tingling
then
more
soothing
foam
closes
semidryly
with
moderate
residual
stickiness
on
the
palate
pour
is
a
transparent
rusty
orange
with
an
off
white
tight
bubbly
head
fairly
rindy
funk
light
yeast
and
spice
some
sweet
golden
fruits
caramel
metallic
acetic
note
the
funk
is
there
in
the
taste
a
bit
dusty
and
some
leathery

light

yeasty
spice
sweet
caramel

golden

flitter
in
with
acetic
notes
in
back
the
body
is
light
with
a
soft
palate
and
moderate
carbonation
o
a
mild
gueuze
that
may
serve
some
purpose
for
someone
but
that
person
isnt
me
o
pretty
much
your
standard
belgian
sour
though
a
little
boring
its
drinkable
and
hits
the
spot
when
your
craving
the
style
strong
brett
and
lemons
in
the
aroma
must
vanilla
sweetness
sweat
and
hay
taste
is
more
brett
forward
and
has
a
light
bile
flavored
acidity
dry
bitter
brett
finish
the
beer
leaves
a
ghostly
fresh
green
apple
flavor
on
the
tongue
which
is
interesting
drinkability
is
very
good
this
was
a
great
gueuze
enjoyable
without
blistering
funk
very
refined
and
well
made
obviously
my
experience
is
the
polar
opposite
of
the
previous
reviewers
not
sure
why
that
would
be
unless
they
significantly
retooled
the
blend
or
as
he
mentioned
perhaps
different
blenders
make
different
batches
for
de
koninck
i
probably
got
this
from
bier
temple
in
brussels
note
on
brewery
i
placed
this
beer
with
de
koninck
since
that
is
what
the
information
on
the
bottle
indicated
to
me
however
tim
webbs
book
indicates
that
this
is
brewed
by
boon
and
other
websites
have
it
listed
with
mort
subites
brewer
first
beer
from
the
brewery
i
wasnt
impressed
with
more
like
nail
polish
remover
smelled
awful
tasted
like
nail
polish
low
carb
just
not
what
a
true
gueuze
should
be
horrid
straight
band
aid
flavored
vinegar
that
has
been
fished
out
of
the
toilet
straight
nail
polish
remover
a
2
5
was
a
gift
bad
very
impressed
with
this
one
can
hang
with
the
big
boys
for
sure
the
mouthfeel
is
very
dry
and
obviously
completely
flat
overally
i
think
this
could
be
a
decent
brew
if
it
was
properly
carbonated
but
unfortunately
something
was
not
handled
properly
ill
revisit
again
if
this
is
corrected
eric
o
a
very
nice
example
especially
one
made
in
the
us
of
the
style
enough
sourness
to
keep
sour
lovers
interested
but
definitely
not
overpowering
very
enjoyable
overall
this
beer
is
an
underrated
gem
i
never
had
a
fresh
sample
but
i
have
to
believe
34
years
is
the
sweet
spot
there
is
incredible
depth
and
one
would
never
guess
this
beer
came
from
a
brewery
in
an
industrial
park
north
of
cincinnati
this
is
up
there
with
many
belgian
examples
of
the
style
absolutely
outstanding
this
beer
is
so
underrated
it
is
a
superb
representation
of
how
a
gueuse
should
taste
and
the
barrel
adds
complexity
and
flavor
i
can
compare
this
to
the
better
know
gueuzes
and
american
wild
ales
taste
has
a
juicy
lemony
citrus
quality
and
bursts
with
citric
acid
and
musty
wet
wood
dry
woody
finish
gripping
and
tannic
with
a
pleasant
lingering
aftertaste
soft
carbonation
its
barely
there
and
ebbs
over
time
but
its
not
completely
flat
the
3yearold
lambic
really
adds
some
complexity
and
authenticity
here
its
vaguely
reminiscent
of
cantillon
classic
gueuze
with
less
body
funk
and
bubbles
overall
im
fairly
disappointed
in
this
beer
carbonation
is
no
where
close
to
where
it
should
be
so
it
cant
help
cover
up
the
lack
of
a
strong
sour
flavor
profile
the
fruit
flavors
are
nice
but
they
never
really
make
the
transition
into
a
unique
gueuze
flavor
overall
decent
sour
not
very
exciting
d
overall
its
a
bit
on
the
bright
side
but
i
think
its
fair
enough
o
it
started
out
rather
bland
but
the
tartness
grew
i
am
partial
to
it
since
it
is
from
my
home
state
and
i
had
to
drink
cincinnati
beer
for
the
wild
card
game
tonight
o
very
nice
a
pleasant
easy
drinker
i
would
have
liked
a
little
more
complexity
and
a
little
more
carbonation
85
pours
with
no
carbonation
okay
minimal
white
head
glowing
orange
golden
body
clouded
to
apricot
tones
im
over
the
carbonation
issue
aroma
is
cider
like
tart
yogurt
like
zing
with
mellow
citrus
earthy
funk
laden
wild
yeast
notes
tart
white
grapes
citrus
peel
like
zing
with
long
lasting
waves
of
sour
lactic
notes
however
its
really
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
thats
if
you
enjoy
sours
im
shocked
how
this
cincinnati
based
brewer
is
churning
out
sours
this
is
dated
2011
i
also
have
a
lambic
dated
2012
such
a
nice
change
of
pace
their
regular
offerings
are
mediocre
but
this
shows
promise
although
i
may
be
chasing
this
with
a
pepcid
medium
bodied
almost
absent
carbonation
finishes
bone
dry
like
some
white
wines
or
ciders
i
have
nothing
but
good
things
to
say
about
this
gueze
pretty
damn
authentic
flavor
someone
has
been
inspired
by
belgian
brewing
traditions
750ml
bottle
that
i
received
from
one
of
you
fine
people
sometime
last
year
bright
yellow
color
aroma
was
nicer
than
the
rivertown
lambic
no
cider
just
lemons
and
hints
of
sourness
flavor
was
good
and
wild
and
occasionally
made
me
pucker
fruity
but
still
not
quite
an
authentic
gueuze
much
like
the
lambic
from
rivertown
this
is
a
fine
wild
ale
but
not
quite
a
match
for
authentic
lambic
i
hope
they
keep
at
it
though
and
i
respect
them
for
going
down
that
road
seems
like
rivertown
is
hit
or
miss
on
the
sours
ojos
negros
sour
cherry
porter
and
lambic
are
all
excellent
this
gueuze
is
not
it
isnt
at
the
level
of
pestilence
but
it
was
disappointing
my
biggest
complaint
with
this
beer
was
that
it
had
absolutely
no
carbonation
it
was
as
flat
a
beer
as
i
have
ever
seen
come
out
of
a
bottle
excluding
some
of
my
early
day
homebrew
as
far
as
i
am
aware
a
gueuze
is
supposed
to
have
extremely
high
carbonation
almost
champagnelike
the
aroma
and
flavor
were
right
on
par
with
many
beers
in
the
same
style
very
sour
with
notes
of
lemon
and
sour
grapes
as
well
as
some
must
dry
and
tart
it
was
just
very
dull
and
bland
the
lack
of
carbonation
really
hurts
this
beer
i
would
pick
it
up
if
i
saw
it
from
a
new
batch
just
to
see
how
it
is
with
carbonation
oi
enjoyed
this
beer
quite
a
bit
reminds
me
a
bit
of
the
bear
republics
tartare
i
would
buy
this
again
thanks
bowling
green
ky
3
25
d
i
have
no
doubts
that
this
was
a
good
beer
when
it
went
into
the
bottle
too
bad
the
technical
aspects
fucked
it
up
the
reason
for
this
not
having
the
proper
carbonation
doesnt
matter
this
is
how
i
bought
it
so
this
is
how
it
is
reviewed
i
havent
heard
about
this
being
much
of
a
problem
so
pick
it
up
if
you
see
it
pretty
good
beer
and
glad
someone
in
the
midwest
is
making
good
sours
on
a
consistant
basis
probably
my
favorite
of
rivertowns
offerings
so
far
overall
nice
but
not
great
the
blending
and
barrel
round
out
the
sour
funk
well
but
overall
just
a
bit
too
thin
o
overall
not
a
bad
beer
just
watery
wish
the
mouthfeel
was
better
as
that
really
affects
the
overall
enjoyability
where
the
beer
carries
a
more
somber
and
moderate
stride
of
intensity
the
complete
ensemble
of
flavor
profiles
of
gueuze
are
all
alive
well
portrayed
and
properly
balanced
there
seems
to
be
a
sense
that
the
beer
is
dialed
down
with
regard
to
intensity
in
taste
sourness
strength
dryness
and
overall
rusticity
its
a
fascinating
beer
that
graduates
up
from
the
syrupy
fruited
versions
and
into
the
authentic
world
of
sour
overall
this
was
a
very
nice
beer
the
fact
that
it
wasnt
super
sour
made
it
interesting
in
my
mind
i
enjoyed
the
funky
notes
i
would
have
more
given
the
chance
the
beer
is
golden
yellowish
orange
and
fairly
hazy
with
a
small
white
head
the
aroma
offers
funk
citrus
hay
oak
nice
flavor
smooth
on
the
palate
with
some
funky
citrus
acetic
character
disappears
rapidly
in
the
finish
pretty
good
i
dont
review
often
but
i
felt
with
the
lack
of
reviews
on
this
beer
i
should
go
ahead
and
do
it
this
is
an
enjoyable
beer
and
can
easily
be
split
between
two
people
this
is
also
a
terrible
gueuze
it
lacks
complexity
carbonation
and
clarity
a
gueuze
is
the
champagne
of
beer
and
on
most
accounts
this
beer
lacks
all
the
qualities
one
associates
with
a
gueuze
if
this
beer
was
branded
as
an
ohio
sour
i
would
have
given
it
a
3
star
rating
but
since
they
are
attaching
the
name
gueuze
to
the
beer
it
leads
to
a
let
down
of
expectations
o
this
is
a
fine
example
of
the
style
that
has
nice
sour
aromas
and
flavors
but
isnt
overpowering
the
cedar
adds
to
the
complexity
this
beer
is
a
great
tragedy
i
enjoyed
the
flavor
very
much
but
am
forced
to
penalize
it
because
of
the
complete
lack
of
effervescence
that
is
expected
in
this
style
sadly
i
cannot
recommend
this
beer
unless
you
have
the
ability
to
carbonate
it
yourself
750
ml
bottle
served
in
a
flute
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
straw
gold
color
with
no
head
at
all
no
lacing
either
aroma
is
nice
but
subtle
the
brew
smells
like
tart
lemons
and
a
bit
of
musty
funk
taste
is
pretty
much
just
like
the
aroma
but
theres
a
bit
of
a
cidery
flavor
too
its
nice
and
tart
its
not
a
strong
tartness
although
it
does
get
better
as
the
beer
warms
up
some
theres
also
a
lingering
tart
finish
mouthfeelbody
is
light
it
has
low
carbonation
and
its
very
easy
to
drink
i
think
its
a
solid
brew
overall
definitely
worth
a
try

a
bottle
this
is
truely
a
unique
brew
13
a
bottle
if
i
handnt
had
a
sample
i
would
never
had
spent
that
much
on
an
unknow
brew
2002
vintage
was
absolutely
divine
perfect
level
of
carb
great
funk
light
tartness
and
zero
oxidation
i
got
lucky
good
but
not
my
favorite
final
score
4
725
pretty
damn
refined
right
now
quite
a
treat
to
try
it
might
be
the
greatest
beer
i
have
ever
had
this
beer
certainly
tastes
different
from
the
original
brew
whether
it
is
more
enjoyable
is
up
for
debate
sour
grapefruit
lemon
pith
bitter
woody
tannins
towards
the
end
clean
and
crisp
very
smooth
with
a
bone
dry
finish
body
is
supple
and
full
at
the
same
time
overall
this
was
nice
to
try
it
seems
like
a
case
of
emperors
new
clothes
but
its
a
classic
drie
fonteinen
gueuze
all
the
same
aggressive
and
formidable
gueuze
not
for
the
fainthearted
and
very
impressive
overall
this
is
really
fantastic
stuff
the
feel
needs
a
few
minutes
to
calm
a
bit
but
the
overall
quality
of
this
aged
gueuze
is
excellent
well
meshed
and
balanced
flavors
highlighting
both
the
funky
and
acidic
sourness
sides
of
the
style
a
real
treat
and
im
happy
to
have
had
the
chance
to
try
this
first
vintage
thanks
again
guys
was
another
great
sour
day
cost
40
for
a
750
ml
bottle
as
i
found
myself
sipping
on
the
dregs
at
the
very
end
i
wondered
if
id
ever
taste
something
like
this
again
i
probably
wont
but
its
wonderful
to
see
what
excellent
wood
and
the
ever
fantastic
recipe
of
3fs
oude
gueuzes
lead
up
to
after
years
of
aging
unbelievably
rich
yet
super
easy
to
drink
and
filled
with
aromas
that
take
me
across
different
palates
overall
this
is
supremely
fabulous
stuff
i
will
hold
this
memory
as
closely
to
me
as
possible
for
the
rest
of
my
life
o
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
cant
wait
to
see
what
another
5
years
does
to
this
get
it
o
although
this
isnt
the
best
geuze
from
armand
it
certainly
has
an
intensity
especially
in
the
aroma
that
not
many
other
blends
can
match
very
nice
2003
vintage
thanks
for
sharing
eugene
pours
cloudy
bright
orange
with
a
nice
off
white
head
the
smell
twists
my
nose
with
funk
sourness
and
tartness
taste
is
wow
the
taste
is
so
well
integrated
and
wonderful
tart
sour
and
funky
light
bodied
with
active
carbonation
overall
a
really
great
beer
its
mean
its
a
vintage
and
it
should
be
obtained
at
all
costs
hide
your
mothers
and
daughters
when
this
bad
boy
comes
to
town
get
ready
to
ride
the
sour
express
pours
a
slightly
hazy
gold
with
a
nice
white
head
smell
is
oaky
and
peppery
with
a
little
bit
of
funk
flavor
is
nice
but
not
as
complex
as
expecting
especially
right
after
the
armand4s
its
extremely
drinkable
and
refreshing
with
a
nice
amount
of
citrus
oak
and
black
pepper
but
isnt
all
that
sour
or
funky
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
bodied
and
super
dry
overall
this
is
a
nice
gueuze
but
not
really
any
more
impressive
than
the
regular
3f
gueuze
pours
a
murky
orange
with
a
foamy
tan
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
slowly
drip
into
the
remaining
beer
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
sour
tart
and
funky
with
malt
yeast
and
acidic
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
quite
an
earthy
flavor
and
an
acidic
finish
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
with
some
great
aromas
and
flavors
o
great
gueuze
i
havent
tried
many
but
this
one
was
almost
at
the
top
of
what
ive
tried
probably
second
only
to
lente
o
a
delicious
gueuze
the
flavors
are
complex
and
wellblended
this
is
a
phenomenal
beer
and
another
testament
to
armands
masterful
skill
this
beer
only
falls
short
of
armand4
in
terms
of
the
best
gueuzes
ive
ever
had
ohad
this
side
by
side
with
armand
tommy
and
i
thought
it
blew
armand
tommy
out
of
the
water
the
funk
has
taken
a
nice
big
hold
of
this
and
isnt
letting
go
armand
is
a
magician
one
of
the
best
gueuzes
ive
had
to
date
trailing
only
loerik
and
blauw
in
my
opinion
i
will
actively
be
seeking
more
bottles
of
this
750ml
2002
yellow
label
thanks
to
brainlayer
okay
lets
crack
this
bad
boy
once
again
is
it
really
the
best
beer
of
all
time
cork
pops
off
with
aggression
pours
is
hazy
deep
orange
with
beige
mousse
thicker
quickly
settling
nose
is
perfect
mild
celery
seed
gets
demolished
by
overripe
peach
and
red
grapfruit
which
yield
to
overwhelming
fresh
birch
and
cedar
with
hay
and
horsey
dry
funk
cobwebby
old
character
is
juxtaposed
with
fresh
and
fleshy
overripe
peach
an
insane
experience
taste
is
ultra
quenching
white
grapefruit
peel
with
sharper
wood
shavings
so
much
old
dried
citrus
peel
plays
with
wood
and
hay
palate
is
perfection
effervescent
and
juicy
with
briny
saltwater
demanding
this
be
drunk
in
large
quenching
gulps
its
disappears
so
quickly
from
the
glass
what
can
you
say
is
the
best
beer
that
which
demands
a
slow
savor
or
that
which
demands
its
consumption
with
boundless
temptation
and
seduction
this
is
probably
the
best
beer
ever
made
like
the
big
brother
to
beatification
which
passed
on
its
power
but
will
never
yield
the
throne

overall
i
dont
know
if
this
is
better
than
regular
oude

i
guess
id
need
to
try
them
side
by
side
armand
blends
the
best
gueuzes
and
this
is
no
exception
phenomenal

of
tart

well
balanced
well
aged

soft
and
not
as
aggressive
as
a
fresh
bottle
still
extremely
tasty
big
thanks
goes
out
to
funkydelic
for
sharing
this
one
during
a
recent
tasting
another
brew
that
has
long
evaded
me
to
try
at
a
tasting
2007
vintage
served
from
bottle
into
a
boulevard
tulip
poured
yelloworange
with
a
one
finger
subtle
offwhite
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
very
slowly
maintained
nice
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
lemon
rine
funk
sour
tart
fruit
and
citrus
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
lemon
rine
funk
sour
tart
and
citrus
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
high
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
good
brew
a
beer
that
i
have
been
wanting
to
try
for
quite
some
time
that
has
been
at
many
tastings
but
never
gotten
opened
it
finally
happened
i
am
a
huge
fan
of
the
regular
version
but
this
one
takes
it
to
a
new
level
with
a
more
citrus
and
lemon
rine
aspect
going
on
than
the
regular
it
was
quite
drinkable
and
extremely
enjoyable
while
being
very
sour
and
tart
it
didnt
make
me
feel
like
my
teeth
were
melting
which
was
a
nice
welcomed
change
definitely
worth
seeking
out
and
i
would
love
to
see
how
this
one
ages
over
the
years
in
a
proper
cellar
obviously
with
3f
on
the
label
its
going
to
be
good
but
its
not
one
of
the
best
in
style
ive
ever
had
will
still
have
again
4
0
d
this
is
good
and
i
appreciate
the
funk
but
its
a
tad
bit
disappointing
especially
given
how
impressive
the
nose
is
dont
get
me
wrong
its
still
a
great
gueuze
but
i
expect
a
lot
from
3f
when
it
comes
to
them
i
enjoyed
this
more
than
any
of
the
armand4
bottles
we
opened
immediately
prior
this
one
aged
quite
well
wish
we
had
another
bottle
probably
not
the
most
complex
brew
of
the
day
but
its
balance
rivaled
lou
pepe
gueuze
and
promised
good
things
from
aging
this
style
of
beer
happy
to
try
it
thanks
again
overall
not
too
biting
which
was
nice
i
thought
this
was
a
fantastic
gueuze
i
havent
had
this
new
but
the
age
seems
to
have
done
it
well

great
balance
of

and

a
stellar
example
of
a
proper
blend
of
gueuze
in
the
same
ballpark
as
lente
if
you
ask
me
i
hope
to
encounter
this
one
again
but
the
price
and
way
its
acquired
deters
me
a
bit
o
absolutely
wonderful
hands
down
the
best
gueuze
that
i
have
ever
had
i
really
have
nothing
else
to
say
about
it
simply
perfect
o
very
enjoyable
im
loving
the
3f
musty
funk
good
tartbitter
character
with
a
nice
earthiness
as
well
after
an
amazing
tasting
day
at
3f
i
cant
help
but
be
a
bit
sad
thinking
about
how
difficult
it
is
to
find
nice
lambicgeuze
in
the
u
s
but
what
a
day
it
was
2005
vintage
375ml
bottle
bright
sweaty
cheesy
funk
with
a
touch
of
leather
and
old
musty
basement
taste
is
bright
lemons
grapefruit
quite
citric
touch
of
pickle
juice
really
really
good
super
dry
awesome
citrsuy
fruit
character
lotta
old
rustic
funk
complex
yet
clean
awesome
beer
o
i
have
now
had
nearly
all
of
the
gueuzes
from
drie
fonteinen
and
i
can
definitely
see
why
people
go
crazy
over
them
they
are
crisp
and
flavorful
while
remaining
easy
to
drink
not
my
favorite
of
the
bunch
but
no
slouch
either
on
a
side
note
i
had
this
february
10
2005
vintage
alongside
my
girlfriends
april
12
2005
bottle
i
found
my
bottle
to
be
slightly
drier
up
front
and
much
less
pithy
and
bitter
on
the
finish
it
also
had
a
much
more
plush
mouthfeel
that
said
i
definitely
preferred
my
bottle
to
hers
o
i
am
not
a
sour
beer
fan
that
is
way
the
scores
are
this
low
i
guess
but
this
sour
i
would
love
to
try
it
again
overall
they
are
both
good
beers
glad
i
got
to
do
a
side
by
side
its
not
radically
different
than
the
modern
so
dont
expect
that
but
there
is
a
notable
difference
o
overall
having
recently
had
a
fresher
one
from
2010
i
can
begin
to
understand
the
current
demand
for
aged
sours
really
easy
drinker
and
really
a
wonderful
interesting
beer
although
i
doubt
ill
ever
dig
sours
more
than
ris
it
is
a
style
that
i
am
beginning
to
enjoy
exploring
i
will
certainly
buy
a
lot
more
of
this
in
the
future
this
is
so
nice
and
more
complex
than
the
regular
much
much
more
enjoyable
o
a
very
drinkable
gueuze
if
there
ever
was
one
i
just
wish
it
was
a
little
more
potent
o
i
like
the
flavors
quite
a
bit
in
the
way
of
sour
candy
not
to
be
savored
for
a
very
long
time
but
worth
investigating
the
taste
is
dry
funky
and
earthy
and
way
more
so
than
it
is
sour
light
on
the
palette
and
goes
down
quite
easy
not
all
that
tart
or
vinegary
really
tame
for
a
guezue
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
very
accessible
idea
of
a
guezue
and
i
enjoyed
it
very
much
the
beer
is
just
delicious
spectacular
gueuze
that
i
hope
to
acquire
some
bottles
for
myself
pours
a
hazy
orange
nice
yellow
colour
light
white
head
nice
appearance
smells
funky
as
shit
amazing
i
love
the
aroma
tastes
funky
sour
and
really
dry
love
the
flavour
profile
good
mouthfeel
overall
a
stellar
brew
o
light
tart
funky
refreshing
so
many
layers
here
it
is
mind
boggling
this
beer
defies
traditional
reviewing
yes
classic
gueuze
aromas
of
hay
and
barnyard
and
lemon
and
a
refreshing
tartness
but
what
i
really
mean
to
say
is
this
beer
smells
and
tastes
like
heaven
with
complete
seriousness
i
think
this
is
the
best
beer
i
have
ever
tasted
should
you
find
yourself
in
the
presence
of
this
beer
do
not
pass
it
up
under
any
circumstances
this
is
just
amazing
one
of
the
best
from

the

huge
amounts

mushroom
oak
sweaty

the

is
tons

well
a
decent
initial
tartness
some
oak
light
lemon
grapefruit

sweaty

finish
very
smooth

the
amount
of
complex

happening
medium

soft
chewy

close

this
beer
was
simply
magnificent
all
the
complex
flavors
come
together
wonderfully
the
only
thing
i
could
ask
for
is
slightly
more
carbonation

bright
white

expresses
citric
acid
and
cork
taste
is
fairly
clean
more
acidic
notes
cork
and
a
slight
peppery
quality
towards
the
back
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
in
consistency
but
closer
to
light
with
a
lively
carbonation
all
and
all
an
easy
drinking
and
refreshing
geuze
thats
fairly
mellow
despite
the
the
age
i
definitely
would
like
to
pick
up
a
few
of
these
to
throw
in
the
cellar
o
this
was
a
very
good
beer
that
suffered
slightly
from
lack
of
carbonation
and
a
smell
that
was
a
bit
underwhelming
still
the
taste
was
wonderful
and
very
balanced
would
gladly
have
again
huge
thanks
to
tog
the
original
glazeman
for
far
and
away
the
best
sour
ive
ever
had
this
2006
gem
was
everything
and
more
that
i
could
have
ever
expected
vintage
2002
aroma
dank
funkyness
sharp
funk
some
cheese
and
citrus
layers
this
is
going
to
be
sharp
and
sour
appearance
dark
gold
and
long
lasting
white
foam
flavors
actually
it
is
not
that
sour
it
is
a
very
balanced
rounded
citrus
sourness
also
earthy
notes
and
wood
brings
a
nice
complexity
palate
relatively
high
carbonation
and
full
bodied
could
have
been
more
dry
overall
this
beer
was
top
shape
and
very
good
tried
the
2007
vintage
directly
after
which
i
liked
a
lot
much
sharper
a
little
more
straightforward
but
equally
good
overall
funky
very
complex
and
quite
enjoyable
as
my
lambic
experience
grows
this
is
definitely
one
i
would
like
to
revisit
in
order
to
appreciate
more
of
the
complexity
that
i
may
have
missed
nonetheless
a
fantastic
beer
cheers
drink
i
couldve
drank
a
whole
lot
more
i
cant
imagine
what
trade
value
is
for
an
04
but
i
sure
as
shit
want
to
find
out
but
its
great
now
too
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
not
still
but
boasts
a
very
light
level
of
carbonation
this
experience
certainly
differs
from
my
previous
samples
i
cant
say
it
was
bad
but
certainly
interesting
i
think
it
might
be
time
to
finally
bust
out
some
of
the
older
bottles
i
have
been
hanging
on
to
overall
as
mentioned
before
i
had
all
the
available
vintages
until
now
but
the
2002
beats
them
all
the
2002
is
a
true
world
class
beer
od
good
gueuze
i
cant
really
tell
what
the
extra
age
has
done
but
the
base
gueuze
is
great
stuff
as
well
glad
i
got
to
try
this
rarity
it
was
worth
it
750ml
bottle
dated

thanks
to
grownfool
ive
heard
a
couple
people
say
this
vintage
is
no
good
dont
believe
them
hazy
orange
like
a
gueuze
would
smells
like
citrus
hay
barn
phenols
tastes
pretty
great
sour
citrus
with
abut
of
plastic
at
the
end
but
damn
was
this
easy
to
knock
back
overall
i
lived
it
and
wish
i
had
more
its
really
too
bad
gueuze
isnt
priced
more
like
ipa
because
i
would
hawg
it
down
o
as
is
the
vintage
oude
gueuze
is
a
very
solid
representation
of
the
style
however
its
brother
armand
oude
gueuze
4
lente
just
makes
it
pale
in
comparison
and
the
availability
is
about
the
same
a
solid
beer
overall
but
in
the
end
outclassed
by
beers
made
and
blended
by
the
same
brewer
overall
i
had
very
high
expectations
for
this
beer
and
they
were
exceeded
with
all
of
its
complexity
it
is
still
incredibly
quaffable
i
absolutely
loved
this
beer
and
hope
to
get
another
bottle
sometime
overall
i
can
really
tell
why
this
is
so
highly
praised
it
deserves
it
a
fantastic
beer
d
quite
drinkable
and
enjoyable
im
happy
that
i
had
the
opportunity
to
taste
it
recommended
75
cl
bottle
2002
vintage
picked
up
at
the
brewery
some
years
ago
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
small
white
head
smell
sour
funky
with
oak
and
hay
grass
the
taste
is
acidic
grassy
and
notes
of
wood
tart
and
dry
finish
i
have
quite
regular
access
to
this
beer
and
i
have
to
say
that
the
2002
vintage
is
one
on
its
own
fantastic
the
overall
feel
is
a
bone
dry
sensation
sprity
but
not
overly
so
the
earthiness
funk
and
briney
salt
water
sensation
make
this
an
absolute
standout
among
geuze
offerings
this
is
absolutely
phenomenal
armand
is
a
true
craftsman
i
dont
know
about
this
one
it
was
quite
the
complex
sour
experience
but
i
was
expecting
something
smooth
and
refined
with
all
the
age
on
it
i
enjoyed
the
standard
3
fonteinen
gueuze
more
worth
a
try
it
might
be
your
thing
o
this
is
gueuze
done
right
by
a
master
this
rivals
a
vintage
cantillon
thanks
to
jason
and
alex
for
helping
make
this
happen
i
really
appreciate
it
and
it
was
a
fun
part
of
the
celebration
although
those
nonbas
thought
we
were
crazy
haha
in
any
case
a
thoroughly
enjoyable
experiment
that
is
well
worth
repeating
in
the
future
thanks
to
alex
and
sean
for
contributing
to
this
an
elegant
and
well
balanced
beer
with
a
clean
acidity
sampled
at
an
drie
fonteinen
tasting
at
de
klomp
linköping
sweden
an
excellent
dirty
but
refined
gueuze
i
have
to
take
my
time
here
which
is
more
selfincrimination
than
anything
else
off
the
top
of
my
tongue
i
prefer
the
regular
nonvintage
version
to
this
but
well
see
how
this
develops
over
time
both
are
winners
another
bottle
this
time
a
2002
white
label
from
a
750ml
bottle
really
earthy
on
the
nose
the
funk
almost
expresses
itself
as
mushroom
of
course
rife
with
lemon
orange
tons
of
oak
on
this
so
dry
oak
is
almost
too
intense
this
is
extraordinarily
bright
and
pungent
and
its
pretty
lovely
i
need
to
drink
this
next
to
a
blauw
drinkability
is
quite
good
i
love
the
3f
funk
in
this
bottle
and
the
citrus
compliments
it
well
however
im
left
wondering
what
a
more
recent
vintage
series
tastes
like
i
think
if
the
brett
were
a
little
less
dominating
then
this
would
be
almost
perfect
overall
this
is
a
great
offering
from
3f
and
the
nose
is
unreal
definitely
worth
seeking
out
d
pretty
easy
to
do
this
is
a
great
beer
would
recommend
to
anone
overall
a
nice
gueuze
but
lacks
the
complexity
id
hoped
for
especially
in
the
finish
d
a
great
gueuze
for
sure
dry
and
tart
with
nice
fruit
character
makes
me
look
forward
to
trying
the
regular
nonvintage
aged
with
a
decade
or
more
on
it
bottle
2002
vinatage
with
the
red
label
pours
a
slightly
hazed
straw
color
with
a
nice
white
head
thy
is
quick
to
settle
nice
aroma
although
a
little
subtle
and
clean
with
hints
of
barnyard
and
earth
citrus
type
aromas
like
grapefruit
sour
and
tart
smelling
very
clean
tasting
with
a
slight
touch
of
medicinal
undertones
amazing
stuff
grapefruit
with
touches
of
tartness
dry
overall
lemon
zest
with
a
slight
touch
of
bitterness
like
tannins
in
wine
light
mouthfeel
with
good
carbonation
overall
this
vintage
blend
is
definitely
among
the
top
4
or
5
bottles
of
3
fonteinen
oude
geuze
i
have
drank
which
means
it
is
one
of
the
best
beers
on
earth
period
overall
a
really
nice
beer
reminded
me
of
millennium
but
it
had
its
differences
it
was
fizzy
and
i
actually
didnt
mind
it
a
very
nice
beer
that
shows
age
but
still
is
awesome
very
drinkable
really
solid
brewski
overall
i
could
have
twoski
small
white
head
with
tightly
packed
bubbles
golden
color
on
the
darker
side
dry
3f
mushroom
funk
in
the
nose
this
one
is
right
around
where
i
like
it
damp
earth
and
vanilla
lemon
acidity
mixed
with
a
nice
dirt
like
brett
funk
in
the
taste
crisp
dry
tart
finish
with
just
a
hint
of
malt
to
add
a
nice
sweetness
lively
carbonation
tickles
the
palate
an
excellent
3f
gueuze
the
taste
brings
on
even
more
funkits
like
the
sweat
of
wet
leather
thats
been
in
a
hay
loft
for
the
past
four
years
just
crazy
funky
a
bit
of
oak
is
present
as
well
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
light
to
medium
with
good
carbonation
really
bringing
the
flavors
through
the
full
palate
drinkability
is
pretty
good
although
as
good
as
this
tasted
i
didnt
immediately
feel
like
i
needed
more
after
id
finished
my
pour
beer
is
light
and
has
a
lot
of
carbon
in
the
mouth
its
tart
and
sour
but
leads
with
the
sour
palate
and
the
tartness
is
minimal
the
acetic
is
winning
i
feel
in
here
with
a
healthy
brettish
funk
on
the
back
end
there
is
a
strong
citric
character
as
well
its
semifruity
if
that
makes
sense
i
love
the
palate
connectivity
of
this
gueuze
i
wonder
what
this
would
be
like
in
10
years
its
complex
and
simple
simultaneously
and
i
love
this
beer
some
were
underwhelmed
by
it
but
its
close
to
perfect
as
a
gueuze
can
be
imo
i
love
this
beer
edit
on
012412
ive
had
vintages
of
06
07
and
08
at
this
point
and
multiple
bottles
of
some
and
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
sours
easily
available
out
there
very
much
worth
seeking
out
d
a
good
lambic
but
not
quite
deserving
of
the
special
labeling
as
noted
above
age
might
of
been
a
factor
looking
forward
to
opening
a
2005
yellow
label
375ml
soon
drinkability
amazing
this
is
one
of
the
best
gueuzes
i
have
ever
tasted
07
vintage
strongly
tannic
with
moderate
sourness
and
funk
i
was
very
impressed
with
this
vintage
and
it
should
continue
to
improve
with
age
pours
a
nice
hazy
orange
with
a
vigorous
head
aroma
is
a
tropical
blast
of
pineapple
with
some
bretty
notes
the
balance
is
definitely
toward
the
fruit
flavor
is
an
evolution
across
citrus
flavors
starts
with
nice
tart
lemon
transitions
to
orange
when
a
hint
of
sweetness
emerges
finishes
with
grapefruit
as
the
a
bitterness
registers
one
of
the
cleanest
geuezes
ive
had
crisp
and
refreshing
quite
nice
i
split
a
bottle
of
the
2005
vintage
with
nathan
imo
at
this
time
it
the
best
beer
of
the
bunch
bright
but
mellow
with
fleshy
ripe
and
sour
grapefruit
with
a
deep
complex
funk
moderately
earthy
and
horesey
ripe
and
rotten
lemons
are
also
present
exceptional
stm
555
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
this
is
a
very
hardcore
sour
it
tastes
old
and
tart
and
itll
make
your
face
pucker
theres
a
lot
of
that
barnyard
wet
blanket
funk
to
it
its
a
super
slow
sipper
but
totally
worth
a
try
d
this
is
just
another
exceptional
gueuze
from
drie
fonteinen
im
happy
to
have
tried
this
and
would
gladly
drink
this
or
any
of
their
other
beers
again
notes
bottled

a
wonderful
gueuze
that
is
very
well
balanced
with
the
tartsourfunky
flavor
and
a
juicy
fruitiness
easy
to
drink
and
a
joy
to
drink
as
well
definitely
recommend

in

dry

dvery
tasty
with
great
balance
and

the
sweetness
works
well
to
offset
the
funkiness
and
the
oak
has
just
enough
of
a
presence
edit
this
was
the
2002
red
label
md
the
carbonation
and
finish
are
spot
on
and
have
me
going
back
for
another
sip
before
i
can
even
sit
the
beer
down
a
standard
that
most
gueuze
should
be
held
to
drinkability
makes
you
want
more
with
each
sip
due
to
the
slighty
dryness
after
two
375
ml
bottles
i
can
say
with
confidence
that
yes
this
is
geuze
alright
this
rating
refers
to
a
special
version
of
the
2002
vintage
geuze
the
same
red
label
as
the
50th
anniversary
geuze
the
bottles
were
sold
recently
at
the
brewery
it
is
a
special
blend
and
not
the
same
beer
as
the
regular
vintage
geuze
from
2002
the
bottle
looks
really
wonderful

o
the

drinkability
is
perhaps
the
highest
of
any
gueuze
ive
ever
had
fantastic
taste
with
a
satisfying
but
not
overwhelming
acidity
wow
d
pretty
good
although
outclassed
by
others

lots
of
elegant

tart

this
was

side

with
the
standard

this
was
hands
down
the
winner
this
maintains
complex
acidity
and
brightness

holds
such
refined
softness
and
gentle
pleasing
flavors
the

2002
vintage
bottle
drank
in
2008
poured
a
slightly
hazy
orangey
color
lambic
with
a
medium
white
bubbly
head
with
good
retention
and
some
lacing
aroma
of
green
apple
with
some
acid
and
sour
notes
and
some
mild
barnyard
notes
taste
is
less
acidic
then
the
aroma
was
suggesting
with
some
sour
notes
and
a
barnyard
feel
which
is
quite
interesting
there
was
some
distinctive
green
apple
notes
which
are
similar
to
the
girardin
gueuze
full
body
with
some
good
carbonation
but
slightly
lower
then
i
was
expecting
i
cant
say
that
i
see
a
huge
difference
form
the
regular
geueze
but
io
as
impressed
nonetheless
i
could
wish
for
a
bit
more
carbonation
here
as
i
like
my
gueuzes
to
be
very
effervescent
but
this
is
a
damn
fine
example
of
the
art
very
well
blended
very
well
integrated
there
is
nothing
that
is
dominant
here
i
do
love
a
good
lambic
gueuze
especially
and
i
wish
that
i
had
the
ability
to
drink
more
of
these
on
a
regular
basis
almost
a
bit
too
refined
for
my
tastes
still
rustic
though
and
definitely
a
finely
crafted
product
but
i
think
i
prefer
the
regular
nonvintage
and
the
1995
vintage
that
i
had
in
2001
a
love
for
stinky
stuff
beers
cheeses
socks
helps
as
has
been
said
a
zillion
times
before
this
style
is
an
acquired
taste
but
drie
fonteinen
stuff
can
be
counted
on
to
see
you
through
enjoyable
and
unique
i
only
wish
i
wouldve
bought
at
least
one
more
bottle
this
beer
will
have
you
cursing
in
foreign
tongues
trying
to
figure
out
what
it
was
that
you
actually
just
put
into
your
mouth
some
etheopian
slang
words
are
entering
my
head
now
just
thinking
about
it
ok
this
is
gueuze
theres
no
getting
around
it
you
are
either
masochitistly
into
this
or
you
try
to
avoid
it
like
the
vile
stench
of
the
night
that
it
is
im
a
masochist
lets
dive
in
this
pours
like
a
fine
sparkling
wine
with
a
fresca
like
effervescence
are
you
allowed
to
compare
beer
to
fresca
here
you
cant
stop
me
theres
all
sorts
of
crazyness
going
on
in
the
nose
sour
spicy
even
bitter
notes
float
up
like
cherries
and
tar
but
in
a
good
way
suck
on
a
lemon
stick
some
tobacco
up
our
nose
and
cover
your
head
with
a
musty
old
gym
bag
congrats
you
just
saved
10
the
body
is
equally
complex
but
strangely
different
from
the
nose
here
youll
find
lots
of
grapefruit
and
sour
apple
cherries
and
some
used
bandaids
it
goes
down
slick
almost
oily
but
still
bubbly
and
light
with
a
clean
refreshing
finish
the
sourness
lingers
longest
on
the
palate
but
every
sip
was
a
mystery
building
on
the
last
so
far
this
is
now
my
favorite
way
to
punish
myself
with
a
gueuze
pale
amber
almost
dark
gold
in
colour
with
mild
sparkling
winelike
carbonation
aromas
of
lemon
wet
hay
barnkyard
paint
black
pepper
and
mild
cherry
all
sorts
of
crazy
flavors
with
this
one
lactic
acid
horse
blanket
wet
cedar
wood
earth
and
mozarella
cheese
at
the
end
the
palate
is
quite
interesting
as
it
starts
out
with
medium
fullness
but
dries
very
quickly
great
sourness
and
complexity
somewhat
cantillonlike
but
a
bit
more
woody
wow
highly
recommended
md
a
surprisingly
soft
body
supports
the
otherwise
very
dry
palate
backed
by
constantly
refreshing
fizziness
that
takes
some
time
to
soften
on
the
tongue
the
overall
flavour
profile
shows
a
sourness
being
welltamed
through
four
years
of
ageing
this
is
the
first
geuze
ive
had
for
more
than
a
year
and
i
feel
really
satisfied
with
the
depth
and
complexity
this
fouryear
old
geuze
has
shown
im
totally
convinced
that
this
bottle
was
reserved
at
the
pub
for
me
older
than
the
golden
doesjel
this
is
a
different
brew
our
bottle
has
a
2006
date
on
it
how
fun
still
flat
golden
and
thin
looking
with
just
a
few
splotchy
bubbles
around
the
edges
of
my
wine
glass
the
nose
is
cool
very
old
moderately
oxidized
but
with
a
cool
fleshy
sourness
and
a
green
pepper
kick
to
it
the
flavor
is
much
of
the
same
with
the
green
pepper
coming
more
up
front
and
it
easing
into
intensely
acidic
sour
lambic
type
beer
i
think
age
has
done
this
well
its
thinness
in
body
makes
me
miss
the
carbonation
less
and
i
like
that
better
than
the
other
one
but
its
still
weird
to
have
flat
lambic
oaky
and
funky
too
its
got
an
almost
marker
taste
to
it
in
the
finish
oxidation
with
lacto
i
assume
but
i
still
like
the
flavor
on
the
whole
this
may
have
been
aged
a
little
past
its
prime
but
the
beer
is
also
a
weird
one
somewhat
accidental
from
the
brewery
if
i
remember
right
fun
bottle
to
share
if
there
are
still
some
around
dont
jump
on
this
bandwagon
and
stockpile
please
i
cant
find
this
brew
already
pours
a
deep
orange
with
no
head
slightly
hazy
smells
tartly
acetic
with
some
notes
of
the
forest
floor
and
some
light
wheat
aromas
the
beer
is
almost
completely
still
just
the
barest
wisp
of
carbonation
for
a
style
like
this
that
doesnt
bother
me
complex
flavors
here
tart
bitter
lots
of
umami
notes
that
go
one
and
on
mushrooms
loam
pine
needles
slightly
metallic
and
woody
at
the
finish
very
smooth
no
slickness
at
all
which
is
nice
because
of
the
low
carbonation
delicious
and
complex
a
cerebral
sipper
overall
another
superb
lambic
from
3f
and
one
of
my
new
favourites
i
am
going
to
have
to
track
down
quite
a
few
more
bottles
o
mild
interesting
variation
to
a
more
typical
gueze
style
completely
out
of
dormancy
this
aged
ale
is
alive
once
again
with
all
the
whimsical
and
elder
characteristics
from
extensive
aging
but
sparing
on
the
tonguegripping
sourness
that
often
proves
too
much
for
the
uninitiated
its
simply
a
gem
of
an
oude
lambic
as
much
as
it
is
a
gueuze
and
should
be
seen
as
such
o
i
apparently
felt
this
beer
was
much
better
than
many
i
really
thought
this
beer
was
more
than
a
one
trick
pony
which
had
a
great
base
flavor
of
apples
and
lemon
zest
o
while
this
is
not
my
favourite
style
it
was
quite
clean
dry
and
refreshing
overall
phenomenal
unique
among
gueuzes
and
very
delicious
thanks
again
phil
easily
drinkable
and
quite
enjoyable
another
really
good
beer
from
3f
overall
while
i
was
excited
to
try
this
i
figured
it
might
not
be
in
the
best
shape
after
sitting
on
the
shelf
for
so
long
surprisingly
it
was
a
pleasantly
sour
complex
beer
a
great
nose
that
smelled
like
an
old
barn
the
complete
lack
of
carbonation
took
some
getting
used
to
as
im
not
very
familiar
with
this
style
but
overall
worth
the
8
overall
exactly
what
i
want
in
an
oude
gueuze
almost
perfected
amazing
blend
of
the
old
and
young
lambics
with
great
balance
great
sourness
and
acidic
tartness
good
overall
funk
pours
a
murky
orange
with
a
foamy
bone
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
sour
tart
and
funky
with
malt
acidic
and
lemonlike
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
fruity
and
acidic
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
medium
amount
of
acidity
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
with
some
great
aromas
and
flavors
overall
nothing
compared
to
oude
geuze
but
a
great

aroma
is

it
smells

tart

some

the
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
but
with
the
addition
of
some

the
tartness
isnt
quite
as
strong
in
the
flavor
as
compared
to
the
aroma
mouthfeelbody
is
lightmedium
its
a
bit
slick
with
moderate
carbonation
i
liked
this
but
maybe
i
should
have
aged
it
longer
before
drinking
it
o
pretty
solid
all
around
and
was
a
good
interpretation
of
a
geuze
o
an
interesting
blend
only
mildly
sour
with
a
nicely
funky
nose
not
exactly
sure
how
the
lack
of
bottle
refermentation
affects
it
but
oh
well
cloudy
copper
pour
with
a
small
ringlet
of
bubbles
for
a
head
and
even
this
petered
out
fairly
quickly
lots
of
funk
in
the
aroma
wet
grass

hay
woody
with
citricacidic
notes
the
acidic

came
through
in

taste
though
not
too
strongly

fairly
intense
gueuzefunk
horse
slightly
cheesynotes
of
lemon
and
wood
thats
been
sitting
outside
for
a
while
about
medium
in
body
with
very
low
carbonation
a
nice
drinker
and
pretty
good
for
the
style
if
on
the
more
mellow
side
overall
overall
i
still
enjoyed
this
beer
enough
but
i
think
i
would
have
preferred
some
carbonation
i
dont
know
that
i
need
more
in
the
future
oa
nice
gueuze
but
i
prefer
the
oude
gueuze
to
this
although
it
does
have
a
nice
distinct
flavor
profile
body
is
less
than
medium
with
a
step
up
from
being
completely
still
the
slight
hit
of
carb
really
steps
up
the
flavor
and
makes
for
a
more
enjoyable
gueuze
i
wonder
if
this
is
the
same
exact
gueuze
that
is
in
the
small
bottles
anyway
while
i
could
probably
drink
a
bottle
to
the
dome
this
is
one
for
sharing
with
like
minded
friends
drink
i
was
so
excited
to
try
this
and
say
i
had
something
from
the
year
of
my
daughters
birth
good
beer
shared
amongst
some
new
friends
and
i
would
love
another
bottle
interesting
one
ive
only
had
a
few
gueuzes
and
this
is
a
fair
bit
different
than
the
others
completely
still
and
a
lot
more
funky
and
woody
than
what
ive
experienced
ok
but
not
my
favorite
o
very
interesting
beer
tough
to
love
off
the
bat
but
wears
well
through
the
course
of
the
bottle
id
probably
be
inclined
to
stick
to
the
oude
gueze
most
of
the
time
especially
as
the
doesjel
is
50
more
expensive
but
this
is
a
nice
alternative
this
one
was
a
part
of

gueuze
glass
poured
a
hazy

with
a
minimal
white
head
maintained
decent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
sour
wood
tart
and
subtle
funk
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
sour
wood
fruit
and
lemon
rine
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
medium
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
good
brew
i
really
like
how
this
one
is
doing
with
this
much
age
on
it
there
is
still
a
ton
of
nice
things
going
on
here
and
it
appears
that
the
funk
aspect
is
developing
i
could
honestly
see
this
one
developing
for
quite
some
time
glad
i
have
quite
a
few
of
these
stockpiled
in
my
personal
cellar
to
try
out
their
aging
potential
o
more
mild
and
muted
very
easy
to
drink
a
great
funky
nose
beer
is
light
to
mediumlight
in
body
with
no
carbonation
leaving
this
feel
a
bit
watery
around
the
edges
resultant
mouthfeel
starts
off
smooth
and
mediumlight
then
fades
to
a
semiwatery
light
feeling
finish
is
dry
and
also
slightly
sticky
again
this
would
be
fine
for
a
lambic
but
if
were
considering
this
a
gueuze
then
the
lack
of
carbonation
and
somewhat
watery
body
are
less
acceptable
overall
impression
wow
complexity
to
the
maximum
ive
never
had
a
gueuze
that
has
been
aged
for
over
5
years
until
this
one
and
am
i
grateful
this
is
going
to
be
put
down
as
one
of
my
top
5
favorite
gueuze
beers
from
here
on
out
hopefully
i
can
pick
up
a
bottle
of
some
of
this
or
any
of
their
others
soon
shelton

a
hazy
golden

with

the

is
more

than
the

it
is
dominated
by

light
cheese
and

rather
dusty
notes

solid
funk
of

oak
and

with
light

finish
and
moderate
sourness
the
body
is
light
assertive
carbonation
and
drinkable
lasting
finish
o
i
enjoyed
this
one
a
bit
more
than
my
rating
would
indicate
i
really
think
the
lack
of
even
the
smallest
bit
of
carbonation
really
brought
this
one
down
a
notch
i
look
forward
to
giving
this
one
another
go
in
the
future
3
5
d
tasty
beer
but
i
think
it
needs
more
power
of
course
this
is
a
fairly
young
gueuze

we
shall
see
what
the
cellar
does
to
this

fruits
and
a
hint

light

a
bit
funky
and
hay
like
with
a
surprising
bit
of
residual
sugar
medium
to
light
body
with
a
spirited
level
of
carbonation
and
a
tart
slick
mouthfeel
nice
beer
to
ring
in
the
new
year
o
very
solid
take
on
the
style
not
the
best
but
far
from
the
worst
the
price
tag
is
a
bit
much
i
think
i
paid
27
for
the
750
at
discount
in
milwaukee
so
wouldnt
buy
again
for
that
price
but
wouldntt
turn
it
down
if
offered
good
beer
o
great
balance
and
funkiness
with
a
smooth
delicious
backing
typing
my
reviews
like
this
always
makes
me
think
of
youre
average
joe
reading
them
thinking
the
description
sounds
disgusting
dear
average
joe
this
beer
is
awesome
overall
just
another
classic
beer
from
this
brewery
love
the
fireplace
ash
angle
this
may
not
be
my
favorite
gueuze
but
its
a
damn
nice
one
im
not
sure
its
worth
the
high
price
tag
and
id
rather
get
the
cantillon
oude
gueuze
100
lambic
for
about
the
same
price
when
you
can
find
it
if
youre
hankering
to
tick
all
3f
beers
i
can
definitely
recommend
this
one
but
if
you
just
want
to
try
a
good
gueuze
save
your
money
for
the
standard
offerings
rather
interesting

a
side
by
side

375
ml
long
cellared
synthetic
cork
pours
almost
completely
still
which
i
am
under
the
impression
is
traditional
for
the
style
a
slight
haze
to
a
orange
colored
beer
gueuze
arent
exactly
supposed
to
look
pretty
even
with
low
carbonation
the
smell
is
quite
intense
an
appealing
mix
of
oak
and
brett
yeast
character
really
appealing
taste
is
similar
to
smell
heavy
presence
of
oak
and
ending
with
bright
sour
yeast
flavor
ph
is
piercing
and
exciting
to
the
palate
i
like
the
lip
puckering
quality
the
lack
of
carbonation
makes
it
surprisingly
smooth
and
quite
drinkable
body
is
thin
as
expected
im
really
impressed
with
the
range
in
the
mouthfeel
soft
wheat
start
oaky
and
sour
kick
lingering
peppery
brettanomyces
i
find
this
bottle
to
be
perfectly
aged
for
my
palate
one
of
the
best
lambics
ive
had
the
pleasure
to
drink
drinkability
not
bad
but
ive
had
better
gueuze
i
have
another
bottle
of
this
that
i
acquired
at
a
different
store
so
ill
rereview
this
when
i
open
that
in
case
this
wasnt
a
good
bottle
very
complex
and
delicious
has
lots
of
unblended
lambic
to
it
more
so
than
gueuze
overall
a
really
nice
funky
gueze
with
one
flaw
a
lack
of
carbonation
really
nice
balance
of
funk
and
sour
i
hope
the
large
format
bottle
i
have
has
better
carbonation
this
version
is
still
very
good
though
a
delicious
gueuze
though
not
quite
as
good
as
the
classic
rather
enjoyable
gueuze
assertive
tart
flavor
complimented
by
an
appropriate
amount
of
funk
very
easy
to
drink
quite
enjoyable
i
do
wish
there
was
some
carbonation
while
i
can
appreciate
the
beer
with
out
i
feel
it
may
have
benefited
by
its
presence
overall
i
have
limited
experience
with
gueuzes
so
far
however
this
is
how
i
pictured
them
acidic
and
funky
cheers
o
a
very
good
gueze
flavor
with
an
interesting
twist
the
still
body
i
must
say
that
this
is
a
really
delicious
beer
o
pretty
enjoyable
with
good
taste
slightly
different
take
with
the
citrus
being
such
a
dominant
component
of
the
gueuze
but
it
was
a
good
beer
it
is
tart
and
acidic
and
quite
pleasant
with
some
fruitiness
but
perhaps
this
one
was
aged
too
long
if
there
is
such
thing
for
a
lambic
but
in
comparison
to
gueuzedudes
notes
mine
is
lacking
aggressiveness
need
to
get
a
fresh
bottle
for
comparison

years
ago
and
it
was
labeled
an
unblended
lambic
i
think
it
would
have
faired
better
as
such
in
the
end
though
this
beer
is
very
good
worth
a
revisit
for
sure
light
and
crisp
on
the
body
with
active
carbonation
overall
an
enjoyable
geurze
a
little
pricy
when
there
are
other
more
affordable
examples
of
the
style
i
remember
this
being
completely
flat
when
i
had
it
a
year
ago
this
older
bottle
is
quite
carbonated
and
im
sure
more
appealing
to
the
masses
o
a
somewhat
different
gueuze
in
my
experience
it
is
pretty
interesting
and
pretty
enjoyable
it
falls
short
of
other
examples
in
my
book
however
all
of
the
flavor
components
of
the
style
seem
to
be
there
but
the
relative
strengths
are
different
than
im
used
to
seeing
a
worthwhile
beer
to
try
and
glad
i
tried
it
o
this
is
a
really
nice
beer
the
only
thing
missing
is
carb
doesjel
is
quite
a
good
gueuze
and
i
will
grab
another
bottle
or
two
for
when
im
in
the
mood
for
some
sour
gueuzey
goodness
overall
although
not
my
favorite
again
a
nice
beer
from
3
fonteinen
popped
the
cork
and
it
let
out
a
nice
pop
and
audible
hiss
so
this
one
was
defiantly
still
alive
poured
into
a
tulip
it
was
a
light
orange
brown
with
a
very
nice
three
finger
head
of
lace
and
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
streaming
up
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
nice
retention
only
gradually
let
the
head
fade
away
what
was
left
was
a
very
nice
set
of
concentric
side
glass
rings
of
lace
smell
was
very
sour
lots
of
grapes
and
other
fruits
a
bit
light
on
the
nose
before
the
sour
wrath
kicks
in
flavor
was
very
full
and
robust
nice
yeast
filled
flavor
wrecks
your
taste
buds
but
calms
down
considerably
on
the
finish
a
huge
rush
of
sour
fruit
than
kicks
into
overdrive
and
puckers
your
lips
through
the
finish
this
was
a
wonderfully
unique
brew
that
had
a
very
good
flavor
and
a
light
fruity
feel
that
really
made
it
shine
o
overall
another
really
nice
beer
from
3f
no
carbonation
as
expected
and
lots
of
oak
and
funk
not
my
favorite
3f
beer
but
something
id
have
again
od
tastes
good
but
a
little
tame
nice
little
gueuze
good
but
not
great
really
nice
one
and
reasonably
priced
would
definitely
get
it
again
o
not
the
best
gueuze
but
overall
it
is
still
pretty
good
in
the
grand
scheme
of
things
o
an
interesting
offering
that
is
worth
the
occasional
exploration
overall
this
drinks
pretty
well
i
think
it
is
miscategorized
but
i
still
enjoyed
it
i
would
prefer
a
genuine
carbonated
gueuze
but
id
happily
drink
this
again
pours
and
orangeamber
color
with
almost
no
carbonation
and
no
head
aroma
is
really
funky
with
a
power
horseblanket
smell
which
is
actually
the
first
time
ive
picked
that
up
in
any
beer
flavor
is
similar
but
the
funk
is
more
offputting
than
pleasant
pucker
coats
the
mouth
and
is
dead
from
lack
of
carbonation
this
was
not
a
very
good
gueze
overall
and
i
expected
more
given
3
fonteinens
reputation
pours
a
moderate
yellow
color
with
a
very
thin
bubbly
white
head
that
went
away
pretty
quickly
the
nose
is
quite
funky
with
a
bit
of
burnt
rubber
really
quite
similar
to
3fs
oude
gueuze
the
flavor
blends
funk
with
a
bit
of
acid
and
hay
mild
oak
character
there
as
well
really
complex
light
body
and
really
dry
finish
burnt
rubber
isnt
as
strong
as
in
the
nose
really
enjoyable
overall
d
more
funk
than
sour
which
is
interesting
but
not
really
what
i
look
for
in
a
gueuze
glad
i
had
a
chance
to
try
it
d
the
only
thing
i
can
really
knock
this
beer
for
is
a
lack
of
carbonation
and
i
cant
knock
it
for
that
because
that
is
how
the
style
is
supposed
to
be
so
it
is
more
just
a
personal
preference
other
than
that
you
find
some
classic
gueuze
staples
with
a
dry
tail
end
that
will
have
you
wanting
another
a
very
soft
and
easy
gueuze
good
for
beginners
yet
sophisticated
for
more
accomplished
drinkers
super
drinkable
for
a
gueuze
and
decent
interesting
still
lambic
intentionally
still
ergo
doesjel
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
perfectly
in
line
where
i
expect
a
still
beer
to
be
because
of
the
reduced
perception
of
sourness
it
it
very
drinkable
and
actually
approachable
to
many
beer
fans
regardless
of
carbonation
level
im
just
starting
to
get
into
still
lambic
and
have
a
handful
i
really
love
the
style
and
this
one
stands
out
as
one
of
my
favorites
this
bottle
was
bottled
in
february
of
2006
so
its
just
short
of
five
years
old
it
poured
an
auburn
burnt
apricot
in
color
with
no
head
or
carbonation
at
all
it
sat
still
lifeless
in
my
snifter
the
aromas
arent
quite
what
i
expected
it
is
very
sour
and
very
dry
thats
about
it
it
kind
of
smells
like
a
very
dry
cider
and
is
kind
of
musty
the
flavor
is
kind
of
hard
to
explain
its
sour
and
doesnt
really
give
hint
to
what
fruit
or
what
flavor
of
lambic
that
this
comes
from
its
kind
of
bland
and
when
i
say
sour
i
mean
probably
the
most
sour
beer
ive
ever
had
being
a
five
year
old
bottle
i
expected
it
to
lose
most
of
the
carbonation
but
this
has
absolutely
none
its
kind
of
flat
being
my
first
gueuze
im
not
sure
if
this
is
desired
or
expected
it
had
the
mouthfeel
of
a
light
white
wine
this
beer
had
good
sourness
but
perhaps
i
shouldve
looked
for
a
younger
bottle
because
it
wasnt
complex
whatsoever
it
was
interesting
and
im
glad
i
tried
it
this
particular
gueuze
just
wasnt
for
me
bottle
opened
with
a
small
pop
and
some
apparent
carbonation
however
upon
pouring
it
was
basically
still
with
a
nice
clear
golden
color
the
aroma
is
complex
and
wonderful
some
fresh
cut
hay
lots
of
horse
blanket
plenty
of
lemon
rind
lots
of
farmyard
funk
one
complex
pungent
little
beer
the
flavor
has
lots
of
lemon
rind
that
provides
a
really
good
bitterness
the
beer
is
very
sour
with
some
tart
cherry
and
a
good
woodiness
this
is
so
damn
good
that
i
really
need
to
revisit
the
regular
gueuze
pours
a
dark
golden
color
into
my
glass
a
few
stray
carbs
make
their
way
up
to
the
top
of
the
glass
but
otherwise
its
pretty
dormant
it
has
a
musty
aged
aroma
to
it
that
mingles
with
lemons
slight
alcohol
remnants
and
some
random
yeastiness
that
creeps
into
the
nose
a
very
tart
somewhat
sour
flavor
to
begin
with
definitely
some
lemon
citrus
some
acetic
acid
makes
its
way
to
the
palate
as
well
has
a
bit
of
an
acidic
burn
as
it
hits
the
back
of
the
throat
nice
earthy
and
smooth
aftertaste
to
mellow
things
out
very
light
on
the
carbonation
dry
in
character
and
fairly
light
bodied
this
is
my
first
tasting
of
the
style
and
in
my
opinion
it
grows
on
you
at
first
i
was
a
bit
surprised
at
how
tart
and
sour
it
was
up
front
but
there
really
is
a
whole
lot
going
on
once
you
get
past
the
initial
characteristics
overall
its
interesting
and
full
of
flavor
nice
and
light
and
much
different
than
anything
i
have
ever
tried
before
this
is
an
enjoyable
easydrinking
gueuze
especially
given
the
low
carbonation
would
have
no
problem
drinking
this
more
often
if
possible
above
average
gueuze
that
is
wonderfully
dry
and
tart
in
the
right
ways
this
is
one
that
will
age
nicely
glad
to
hanging
on
to
a
couple
more
bottles
drinkability
great
flavor
profile
but
the
lack
of
any
notion
of
carbonation
is
hard
to
get
past
didnt
have
the
depth
of
tartness
that
i
was
hoping
for
in
a
fourandahalf
year
old
bottle
of
gueuze
not
in
love
but
still
a
very
worthwhile
gueuze
mmmm
so
good
has
a
dry
sourness
and
it
seems
like
barrel
aging
has
smoothed
out
the
flavor
somewhat
it
is
not
the
sourest
gueuze
out
there
but
it
is
probably
about
a
3
5
out
of
5
on
the
puckering
scale
this
beer
has
an
amazing
ability
to
quench
the
thirst
awesome
beer
i
am
loving
me
some
drie
fonteinen
bottle
dated
feb
23
2006
from
lush
west
town
pours
a
golden
brownorange
with
no
head
nose
is
sour
green
apple
with
funky
rubber
yeast
and
white
bread
taste
is
sour
and
funky
with
green
apple
a
nutty
finish
and
citrus
pith
bitterness
carbonation
is
very
low
with
a
drying
almost
tannic
mouthfeel
and
a
long
hazelnut
finish
overall
a
very
nice
gueuze
this
is
damn
drinkable
and
i
dont
think
the
meager
375ml
bottle
before
me
will
slake
my
thirst
for
this
snoozer
drinks
great
more
like
a
funky
white
grape
juice
than
a
beer
i
really
like
it
even
sans
carbonation
d
a
great
gueuze
that
fits
the
style
well
despite
already
being
over
4
years
old
it
has
tons
of
time
left
in
it
for
the
future
this
one
goes
down
extremely
easy
particularly
for
the
style
overall
a
good
gueuze
suppose
i
should
be
seeking
out
more
3
fonteinen
very
smooth
and
easydrinking
quality
beer
d
not
my
favorite
of
the
drie
fonteinen
lineup
but
still
damn
good
we
love
it
clear
appearance
with
absolutely
no
head
or
lacing
exactly
as
the
label
indicated
funky
sour
aromas
with
a
subtle
fruitiness
and
a
little
bit
of
barnyard
or
farm
scents
the
taste
is
very
tart
though
the
acidity
is
lower
than
i
anticipated
making
this
a
rather
drinkable
beer
carbonation
is
virtually
nonexistent
and
the
beer
has
a
watery
smooth
feel
overall
a
pretty
decent
gueuze
overall
enjoyable
sour
that
shouldnt
be
served
very
cold
preferably
chilled
or
perhaps
even
room
temp
for
maximum
sourness
still
not
much
complexity
aside
from
a
bit
of
general
funk
depth
solid
beer
but
a
bit
too
pricey
imo
mmmm
yeaahhh
wellll
i
guess
ive
had
other
lambics
with
carbonation
this
one
poured
as
they
said
without
head
and
of
course
no
lace
color
is
a
slightly
hazy
medium
amber
aroma
is
yeast
malt
fruit
sour
fresh
sawn
wood
funk
flavor
is
similar
body
is
full
and
again
flat
finish
is
like
flavor
and
long
not
my
kind
of
beer
going
to
ditch
it
maybe
could
cook
with
it
this
beer
is
good
but
maybe
not
their
best
taste
is
very
tart
over
the
top
almost
its
mouth
puckering
the
whole
way
down
but
every
sip
makes
you
want
more
its
a
very
slow
drinker
but
every
drop
is
awesome
and
it
gets
better
as
it
warms
d
exceedingly
awesome
i
wish
it
wasnt
so
expensive
5
0
i
really
liked
the
smell
and
taste
of
this
beer
however
the
complete
lack
of
carbonation
really
affected
my
enjoyment
of
this
beer
from
the
very
get
go
with
the
still
lifeless
pour
to
the
complete
lack
of
decent
mouthfeel
its
just
really
hard
to
give
this
beer
higher
marks
beer
is
quite
thin
very
tart
and
sour
with
good
acetic
notes
i
know
this
is
the
uncarbonated
version
but
it
would
be
greatly
improved
in
flavor
and
mouthfeel
with
some
carbonation
otherwise
another
great
gueuze
bizarre
the
stillness
robs
the
beer
of
its
character
and
makes
this
taste
like
some
kind
of
oakaged
lemonade
now
theres
an
opportunity
in
the
juice
stand
market
theres
so
much
promise
here
but
an
experience
like
this
makes
you
realise
how
much
carbonation
can
make
or
break
a
beer
i
understand
this
is
supposed
to
be
flat
but
it
could
really
do
with
a
bit
of
zip
to
elevate
it
above
the
level
of
lemonade
ive
reviewed
it
to
its
original
intention
of
flatness
and
given
the
mouthfeel
an
average
score
but
this
really
wasnt
to
my
liking
the
lack
of
carbonation
really
kills
this
one
disappointed
d
not
my
favorite
from
drie
fonteinen
but
a
solid
lambic
as
always
i
wonder
if
this
will
carbonatechange
much
with
more
time
on
it
oh
that
classic
drie
fonteinen
funk
pungent
grapefruit
horseblanket
woodsy
earthy
mildly
mushroomy
juicy
fruity
pithy
citrusy
all
brilliantly
done
moderately
tannic
as
well
this
one
is
just
outstanding
the
palate
opens
bright
acidic
mineraly
with
grapefruit
juice
a
moderate
funk
thats
a
blend
of
rotting
lemons
pith
and
loam
moderately
tannic
on
the
finish
theres
a
blend
of
grapefruit
juice
lemons
vanilla
and
oak
along
with
a
funky
bouquet
mediumlight
in
body
with
the
blend
of
juicy
acidity
and
tannins
lending
heft
and
structure
to
the
palate
this
beer
is
mildly
carbonated
if
my
memory
serves
me
right
this
bottling
is
a
hair
less
tannic
than
the
1723
feb
2006
bottlings
which
makes
this
just
a
shade
watery
despite
that
this
beer
is
quite
the
masterpiece
highly
recommended
despite
the
high
price

dan
absolutely
excellent
blended
oak
lambic
all
that
funk
melds
seamlessly
with
bright
sourness
and
an
amazingly
dry
oak
finish
exquisite
overall
this
is
another
nice
offering
from
drie
fonteinen
nothing
ever
really
stands
out
but
there
are
a
lot
of
nice
subtle
complexities
to
the
beer
wouldnt
mind
picking
up
another
bottle
if
the
price
were
a
little
cheaper
very
drinkable
its
a
very
contemplative
drinking
experience
could
easily
gulp
down
the
whole
bottle
drinkability
high
even
with
it
being
flat
actually
might
be
gulping
it
i
would
rather
have
this
than
lemonade
on
a
spring
day
rich
and
complex
ive
had
sours
that
were
so
mouthwatering
and
quenching
i
could
gulp
them
this
is
not
one
of
those
sours
deep
and
contemplative
and
certainly
a
sipper
picked
up
at
granite
a
few
days
ago
and
decided
to
pop
open
tonite
vicious
pour
into
a
portsmouth
tulip
presents
a
light
orange
body
with
a
wispy
white
head
strong
aroma
at
first
of
sour
apple
and
tons
of
barnyard
after
a
short
while
the
aroma
lessens
tons
of
sour
on
the
tongue
at
first
but
this
mellows
lots
of
sour
apple
followed
by
overripe
dark
fruit
flavors
mouthfeel
is
overslick
this
thing
just
dies
in
your
mouth
a
nice
sour
beer
to
share
with
a
few
friends
but
dont
wanna
drink
this
whole
bottle
overall
doesjel
was
a
real
treat
to
drink
it
was
definitely
a
snoozer
as
the
description
stated
but
do
not
let
that
deter
you
from
experiencing
this
beer
if
you
are
into
the
style
you
will
enjoy
this
solid
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
very
good
gueuze
d
my
first
beer
from
this
brewery
isnt
a
great
experience
i
wont
be
buying
this
one
again
at
10
a
bottle
it
came
across
as
overpriced
id
much
rather
get
the
slightly
cheaper
cantillon
gueuze
every
time
d
hated
it
d
this
beer
has
no
carbonation
at
all
a
little
would
help
a
lot
the
astringency
is
soft
and
the
tartness
is
pretty
mild
but
not
much
supporting
flavors
this
is
the
first
thing
ive
had
from
this
brewery
that
hasnt
blown
me
away
goes
down
without
being
harsh
or
puckering
by
any
stretch
and
calls
you
back
for
more
d
fantastic
beer
worth
seeking
out
pours
a
hazy
dark
golden
brown
color
with
no
head
whatsoever
aroma
is
of
citrus
orange
lemons
and
grapefruit
with
strong
funky
cheese
notes
taste
is
mildy
sour
with
oak
notes
as
well
finishes
relatively
dry
with
the
citrus
and
fruit
notes
becoming
more
prominent
to
balance
the
sourness
the
beer
really
shines
on
the
palate
its
very
sour
woody
and
earthy
signature
drie
fonteinen
lemonlike
lactic
acidity
meets
strong
oaky
tannins
orange
peel
earth
wood
the
body
is
almost
still
and
its
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
tons
of
flavor
given
the
overall
lightness
and
frankly
i
wish
the
bottle
was
larger
it
finishes
tannic
woody
and
sharply
sour
very
enjoyable
one
of
the
best
from
3f
picked
this
bottle
up
at
small
liquor
store
in
chicago
first
time
trying
this
brewery
after
wanting
to
for
a
while
poured
into
my
tulip
glass
pours
a
deep
golden
color
with
no
head
and
no
cloudiness
the
smell
is
strong

wet

aid
the
brett
does
little
to
hide
its
flavor
up
front
you
get
a
strong
acidic
orange
peel
tastecompeting
with
just
a
dash
of
semisweet
pears
followed
by
the
funkiness
of
brett
doing
its
job
by
imparting
cheese
and
vine
to
the
flavor
finishs
very
dry
with
sour
lemons
and
funkified
wheat
not
nearly
as
acidic
as
some
i
have
had
but
enjoyed
overall
will
buy
again
for
sure
very
quaffable
and
easy
to
drink
especially
for
the
style
a
bit
watered
down
and
not
acidic
at
all
slight
tart
earthy
funk
flavor
that
is
pretty
tame
for
an
authentic
gueuze
dry
oaky
vinous
character
with
slight
sour
vinegary
presence
although
it
isnt
as
sour
as
expected
it
becomes
more
so
as
it
warms
up
the
finish
is
a
med
light
body
and
a
strong
lingering
sourness
this
is
a
nice
geueze
and
definetly
worth
a
go
drinkability
not
the
most
acidic
gueuze
by
any
stretch
but
acidic
enough
that
i
cant
score
it
higher
than
4
0
and
its
only
getting
a
score
that
high
because
it
is
so
flat
which
makes
it
go
down
like
nothing
d
good
but
slightly
uninteresting
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
crisp
with
just
a
mellow
tingle
of
carbonation
as
it
flows
down
this
sleepy
lambic
is
pretty
tasty
and
the
only
other
beer
i
have
to
compare
this
to
is
the
cantillon
loerik
i
drank
a
few
years
ago
overall
its
fun
to
drink
a
beer
like
this
that
shows
off
another
aspect
of
brewing
and
the
variations
that
can
occur
i
wonder
what
10
or
20
years
in
the
cellar
might
do
to
this
overall
i
like
my
sour
ales
to
have
at
least
some
carbonation
and
this
was
totally
flat
my
first
offering
from
this
brewery
and
ive
had
it
twice
and
this
one
is
not
impressive
carbonate
it
and
ill
come
back
to
it
d
the
intensity
of
the
tartness
and
funkiness
makes
this
one
a
sipper
as
with
most
sours
complexity
keeps
this
interesting
through
the
whole
bottle
though
no
head
to
speak
of
once
again
color
had
a
great
range
from
a
lightgold
to
a
pressedcider
light
brown
this
was
a
gift
from
tjs
everyday
and
i
wanted
to
share
it
with
some
friends
taste
ranged
from
lemon
citrus
straw
hay
astringent
tart
to
light
cider
green
apple
and
mild
horse
blanket
mouthfeel
was
medium
finish
was
dry
really
dry
cleansing
the
palate
and
leaving
me
wanting
more
this
again
would
be
a
beer
to
share
rather
than
bogart
d
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
this
one
is
like
its
older
brother
oude
gueuze
yet
much
more
potent
with
more
concentrated
flavors
taste
is
more
of
the
lemony
sour
flavor
incredibly
smooth
but
the
lack
of
carbonation
makes
this
feel
way
too
thin
very
smooth
you
just
want
to
keep
drinking
with
every
sip
i
knew
going
in
that
it
wasnt
carbonated
by
design
but
i
dont
think
im
getting
used
to
it
this
would
be
very
good
with
just
a
little
bit
of
carbonation
still
good
flavor
this
must
be
one
of
the
lesser
efforts
from
a
normally
fine
brewery
from
the
label
doesjel
in
flemish
means
roughly
snoozer
yes
this
one
is
a
snoozer
for
me
as
well
for
me
this
beer
was
something
of
a
mixed
bag
from
a
375
ml
bottle
it
pours
a
cloudy
burntgold
color
the
beer
is
completely
still
zero
head
the
aroma
is
interesting
though
lots
of
horse
blanket
and
funk
brett
and
a
little
malt
not
a
tart
smelling
brew
though
the
taste
also
inst
as
tart
as
i
expected
its
got
some
slightly
acidic
notes
but
it
falls
way
short
of
being
sour
this
actually
makes
the
beer
quite
drinkable
but
the
lack
of
sourness
seems
to
leave
the
brew
a
little
hollow
the
mouthfeel
is
really
compromised
by
the
lack
of
any
carbonation
leaving
the
beer
with
a
flabby
body
in
the
end
i
wasnt
really
impressed
with
this
one
d
while
the
lack
of
sour
is
upsetting
on
most
levels
it
does
mean
i
could
drink
a
case
of
this
just
a
nice
refreshing
beer
this
would
be
a
good
example
of
a
beer
for
someone
trying
the
style
for
the
first
time
im
surprised
that
other
bas
arent
liking
this
as
much
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
i
just
cant
get
past
the
carbonation
still
its
worth
a
try
to
see
for
yourself
d
drinking
this
brew
was
an
interesting
experience
i
wanted
to
like
it
but
it
just
didnt
impress
me
as
much
as
id
hoped
i
would
like
to
try
it
again
with
different
foods
i
think
fresh
goat
cheese
choucroute
roast
pork
potatoes
and
cows
milk
cheeses
like
comte
would
pair
very
well
with
this
unique
brew
on
its
own
though
this
brew
didnt
quite
do
it
for
me
avoid
overall
this
one
had
great
flavor
qualities
but
the
mouthfeel
threw
it
off
for
me
brilliant
the
aroma
in
the
glass
reminded
me
of
a
flowery
home
perfume
something
like
you
might
find
at
grandmas
house
on
hitting
the
tongue
you
immediately
feel
the
tartsour
flavor
biting
in
yet
it
is
not
unpleasant
in
the
least
the
mid
palate
brings
to
mind
a
very
self
preserved
flavor
reminiscent
of
slightly
pickled
vegetables
citruses
and
strangely
enough
sea
water
as
opposed
to
other
reviewers
this
is
not
a
beer
that
i
personally
would
find
to
be
well
suited
to
having
multiple
servings
it
is
one
better
appreciated
over
a
while
and
i
couldnt
drink
it
too
fast
to
each
his
own
though
i
suppose
the
tartbitter
flavor
became
a
bit
overwhelming
if
i
tried
to
consume
too
much
in
one
drink
or
multiple
drinks
in
a
row
the
drinkability
is
very
good
this
is
one
of
the
most
drinkable
gueuzes
ive
ever
had
it
retains
a
strong
sourness
while
having
a
smooth
and
balanced
character
without
taking
away
it
inherently
gueuzey
qualities
pours
a
fairly
dark

i
ate
some

there
are

to
keep

interesting
i
am
a
big
fan
of
this
brewery
but
i
must
admit
that
i
was
slightly
disappointed
with
the
results
of
this
one
drinkability
would
be
high
if
i
could
acquire
this
all
the
time
d
this
is
a
very
good
gueuze
which
in
my
mind
is
drinkable
in
every
way
except
the
cost
this
was
an
enjoyable
beer
but
it
lacked
some
of
my
favorite
qualities
in
a
gueuze
bright
flavors
and
vigorous
carbonation
thanks
to
xnoxhatex
for
introducing
me
to
this
one
drinkability
is
good
a
tasty
gueze
for
sure
but
also
the
most
expensive
of
those
locally
available
to
me
for
40
less
ill
take
cantillion
every
time
still
a
damn
fine
gueze
i
hated
to
see
that
last
drop
go
no
carbonation
at
all
a
touch
less
than
medium
bodied
finish
is
short
and
dry

the

this
is
a
great
blend
of
a
1
2
3
year
old
gueuze
blending
seems
too
be
a
lost
art
that
was
not
forgotten
on
this
beer
drinkability
fairly
nice
and
about
as
refreshing
as
a
gueze
can
get
for
me
id
say
it
could
use
a
touch

really
it

warming

is
a

of
three
vintages
of
lambic
ales
aged
in
oak
barrels
for
one
two
and
three
years
then
bottle
conditioned
my
pour
showed
a
sedate
lack
of
co2
it
was
warm
golden
color
with
no
head
or
lace
and
a
taste
like
tart
unripe
fruit
sour
but
not
puckering
the
nearest
thing
i
would
compare
it
to
is
apple
cider
vinegar
a
challenge
to
appreciate
and
easily
defeated
by
cantillon
classic
or
gueuze
girardin
drinkability
fairly
low
im
afraid
i
find
it
hard
to
believe
anyone
could
want
a
second
bottle
of
this
i
had
a
hard
enough
time
finishing
the
one
bottle
samnpled
sitting
at
the
bar
at
delirium
in
brussels
i
had
previously
purchased
a
bottle
of
this
in
antwerp
but
have
had
it
cellaring
the
beer
poured
a
clear
golden
body
with
a
medium
white
head
the
nose
was
a
bit
funky
earthy
and
had
hits
of
wood
the
taste
was
more
of
the
same
from
the
nose
the
beer
was
tart
dry
and
had
definite
notes
of
oak
and
maybe
even
some
smoke
very
interesting
beer
and
another
hit
from
drie
fonteinen
i
love
a
good
lambic
it
is
so
rare
that
i
get
one
much
less
a
good
one
here
in
the
states
this
one
drinks
so
nicely
certainly
not
an
aggressive
hard
version
the
blend
clearly
influences
that
but
i
really
like
the
mix
of
flavors
aromas
found
here
to
be
perfect
i
would
request
a
touch
more
barnyard
funkiness
but
this
is
fabulous
as
is
a
375ml
bottle
almost
isnt
enough
as
i
find
this
so
drinkable
that
i
am
having
a
hard
time
collecting
my
thoughts
about
the
beer
and
am
instead
just
enjoying
it
definitely
a
good
sign
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
tart
with
wild
yeast
and
bacteria
making
for
an
interesting
brew
its
actually
not
as
tart
as
i
wouldve
expected
well
done
love
the
peachiness
and
how
easy
it
drinks
there
is
even
greater
depth
in
the
flavor

with
a

just
not
my

one

better
sours

had
this
is
what
gueuze
is
at
its
finest
blended
to
perfection
and
still
kickin
after
all
this
time
more
earthy
than
i
would
have
expected
but
a
very

drinker
heres
to

this
is
such
a
bright
flavorful
beer
with
a
lot
going
on
its
actually
quite
exciting
drinking
this
as
it
seems
like
each
sip
brings
a
new
flavor
the
age
from
the
older
beer
in
the
blend
also
really
comes
through
tasting
old
and
funky
in
the
best
possible
way
t
much
more
dry
than
sour
this
is
probably
the
closest
thing
to
classic
cantillon
ive
had
its
similar
to
the
aroma

seem
to
be

some

in

there
is
a

a
beer
worthy
of
its
acclaim
a
dry

complex
easy
drinking
beer
for
sure
a
tad
pricey
but
still
a
worthy
purchase
o
one
of
the
better
geuze
ive
had
lots
of
those
really
bizarre
funky
and
sour
flavors
that
only
come
from
a
lambic
very
easy
drinking
and
enjoyable
worth
the
cost
o
just
a
fantastic
gueuze
literally
a
benchmark
of
the
style
and
it
shows
beautifully
complex
aroma
and
flavor
and
each
sip
literally
leaves
your
mouth
watering
and
craving
more
could
drink
this
every
single
day
without
any
issue
i
am
pretty
sure
this

for
the
style
that
very
classic
big
barn
yard
aroma
and
flavor
is
all
over
this
one
and
i
like
it
glass
fills
with
foam
loads
of
beads
of
carbonation
stuck
in
a
nice
gold
body
very
effervescent
smell
is
tannic
apples
and
herbs
nice
mix
of
sweet
and
tart
in
the
flavor
apple
peelings
and
sour
apples
also
very
much
enjoyed
this
treat
o
this
is
one
of
the
easiest
to
drink
beers
in
the
style
and
is
extremely
enjoyable
probably
one
of
the
best
ones
i
have
had
the
opportunity
to
experience
good
flavorsaromas
and
sournesstartness
without
being
overpowering
overall
this
is
one
of
the
best
geuzes
for
consistancy
and
quality
year
in
year
out
its
at
the
top
people
chase
cantillon
but
to
me
this
is
the
beer
to
chase
thank
god
i
can
still
get
23
bottles
each
relaease
for
this
dated
22
march
2012
this
oude
geuze
is
fermented
in
the
bottle
it
creates
beautiful
tiny
bubbles
that
are
champagne
like
awesome
overall
this
is
a
really
great
beer
that
i
am
glad
i
gave
a
1
5
years
in
the
bottle
it
is
right
up
there
in
the
top
two
or
three
guezes
i
have
tasted
very
complex
and
makes
it
very
difficult
pick
out
individual
flavors
overall
really
excellent
spectacular
very
funky
and
woody
gueuze
i
had
this
blind
against
tilquin
and
this
clearly
won
for
its
zesty
fruit
qualities
and
complexity
with
this
beer
wonderful
aroma
coming
off
the
top
let
the
beer
do
its
thing
and
then
shortly
after
poured
into
a
snifter
tart
cherries
barnyard
hay
and
spicy
yeast
on
the
nose
taste
of
spicy
yeast
and
horse
blanket
nice
dry
finish
that
really
leaves
your
palate
unscathed
mouthfeel
the
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
with
very
little
viscosity
the
beer
moves
from
puckering
to
mouthwatering
to
tart
very
smoothly
overall
amazing
beer
far
better
than
tilquin
and
boons
geuzes
o
one
of
the
best
gueuze
that
ive
had
its
packed
with
puckering
flavor
and
keeps
you
wanting
more
o
very
enjoyable
and
lament
that
i
only
had
a
375ml
as
there
are
so
many
layers
to
this
brew
very
enjoyable
this
is
far
more
funky
and
earthy
than
the
golden
blend
i
tried
the
other
day
and
it
hurts
the
brew
its
a
very
good
lambic
overall
but
simply
not
as
special
and
not
as
good
off
of
one
bottle
i
have
to
say
this
rates
with
a
typical
geuze
or
gose
instead
of
standing
out
as
something
particularly
special
all
in
all
top
stuff
top
gueze
maybe
i
just
need
to
do
a
massive
a
b
taste
comparison
to
start
understanding
the
subtleties
that
set
this
apart
from
say
cantillon
maybe
less
sour
hmmm
great
o
gosh
do
i
enjoy
this
more
than
cantillon
gueuze
i
think
i
might
pounded
light
orange
with
a
big
bubbly
white
three
finger
head
that
lingers
for
quite
a
while
smell
is
funky
barnyard
some
lemon
earthy
taste
starts
with
a
nice
citrus
note
sour
up
front
that
fades
to
some
slight
sweetness
dry
dirty
some
apple
some
vedgtable
notes
oak
this
is
fantastic
lot
of
carbonation
but
still
great
texture
just
the
right
amount
of
funk
and
sourness
i
can
see
why
this
is
a
gold
standard
again
just
not
my
cup
of
tea
generally
but
even
so
this
was
pretty
tasty
and
impressive
thanks

tart
fruity
light
and
refreshing
but
the
flavor
seems
rather
one
dimensional
and
i
cannot
get
past
the
overwhelming
barnyard
aromas
somewhat
disappointing
i
had
no
idea
this
was
so
readily
available
beautiful
o
really
delicious
stuf
not
among
my
all
time
favorite
sours
but
perhaps
my
favorite
gueuze
o
overall
a
very
tasty
beer
love
the
funk
on
the
nose
and
all
the
tartness
on
the
palate
the
dryness
reminds
me
of
big
cabs
and
i
love
it
would
recommend
more
years
in
the
cellar
though
the
store
i
got
it
from
has
a
bunch
more
so
i
think
i
am
going
to
get
four
or
five
and
age
them
for
a
while
but
good
now
too
if
youre
wondering

2014
greg
at
the
bier
cellar
told
me
they
only
got
this
beer
as
a
im
sorry
gift
from
the
distributor
for
something
that
had
gone
wrong
but
were
told
not
to
advertise
it
glad
i
stopped
by
to
grab
one
not
that
easy
to
find
in
australia
especially
in
regional
areas
so
a
rare
treat
overall
either
this
bottle
is
bad
or
these
things
taste
like
shit
fresh
ill
try
and
get
another
to
lie
down
for
a
few
years
to
find
out
but
this
experience
wasnt
worth
anything
near
the
13
i
paid
for
it
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
to
light
bodied
with
a
fine
carbonation
this
one
exceeded
my
expectations
o
as
my
first
true
lambicgueuze
this
is
incredible
the
smells
and
flavors
of
this
beer
are
big
and
tart
but
at
the
same
time
have
a
wonderful
drinkability
there
is
a
lot
of
flavors
that
round
out
the
tartness
and
really
make
this
a
wonderful
beer
o
for
whatever
reason
this
bottle
was
flat
ive
had
this
beer
many
times
and
never
found
it
to
be
like
this
my
score
reflects
the
undesirable
quality
in
this
sample
but
ill
say
that
this
is
easily
one
of
my
favorite
sours
under
normal
circumstances
some
of
the
other
more
highly
rated
geuzes
out
there
are
far
more
sharp
and
sour
this
one
showcases
a
perfect
balance
between
funk
sour
and
malt
sweetness
with
a
touch
of
oak
thrown
in
for
good
measure
tannins
are
there
but
play
more
softly
on
the
palate
than
most
do
a
musttry
beer
pours
a
hazy
grapefruit
orange
color
with
a
fair
amount
of
egg
shell
head
that
faded
fairly
quickly
no
legs
and
light
lacing
good
thin
collar
aroma
is
very
much
like
when
i
would
march
in
my
highschool
homecoming
parade
and
the
floats
were
all
covered
in
straw
i
also
pick
up
some
lemon
and
grapefruit
the
flavor
provile
is
very
citrusy
tart
up
front
then
some
dry
grass
nice
silty
mouthfeel
very
dry
and
that
tartness
stings
the
tongue
very
glad
i
got
to
try
this
but
i
wouldnt
put
it
in
my
top
5
maybe
not
in
the
top
10
basically
this
held
up
quite
well
against
the
seasons
although
this
is
obviously
not
on
the
same
level
as
zomer
i
might
actually
enjoy
this
more
than
winter
though
its
crisp
refreshing
lemony
with
some
funk
but
not
so
much
that
it
dominates
the
beer
for
the
pricequantityrarity
triangle
i
can
agree
that
this
is
the
best
value
although
its
worth
going
after
the
seasons
to
try
at
least
once
stock
up
on
this
drink
some
and
age
some
its
probably
the
best
shelf
geuze
out
there
the
beer
smelled
great
but
it
was
not
nearly
as
potent
as
the
seasons
nose
and
flavor
was
a
tad
funky
and
had
the
nice
drie
fonteinen
citrus
notes
that
i
love
a
lot
of
fun
to
drink
and
exponentially
improved
as
it
warmed
to
be
sure
this
is
an
affordable
and
relatively
accessible
beer
making
it
a
contender
for
the
everyday
gueuze
category
however
when
it
was
compared
with
the
big
boys
this
really
fell
short
although
i
would
have
never
realized
this
if
i
were
not
doing
a
side
by
side
this
beer
is
better
than
golden
blend
imo
an
excellent
all
around
beer
and
a
notch
above
the
cantillon
classic
sour
sunday
here
we
go
have
been
enjoying
lately
big
sours
watching
sunday
football
games
on
tv
this
oude
geuze
does
not
disappoint
not
as
sour
as
i
was
thinking
it
might
have
been
extremely
drinkable
and
a
pleasure
to
sip
on
class
act
overall
this
is
really
good
well
worth
the
trade
im
glad
i
could
get
some
of
this
id
love
to
compare
it
to
the
other
world
class
gueuzes
i
still
havent
had
cantillons
for
example
definitely
worth
checking
out
and
definitely
going
to
remember
to
order
more
next
time
a
perfect
rough
gueuze
almost
immaculate
5
overall
i
am
not
really
a
geuze
kind
of
guy
but
i
can
recognize
a
beer
that
is
well
done
this
is
well
done
a
funky
party
this
one
is
bolder
than
cantillon
while
the
latter
is
more
elegant
so
depends
on
what
mood
you
are
on
but
it
may
be
a
notch
above
the
other
an
outstanding
gueuze
i
just
wish
it
were
a
bit
gentler
o
this
is
a
tart
beer
the
sweetness
on
the
back
really
made
this
beer
for
me
the
tart
flavors
were
enjoyable
but
the
sweet
finish
helped
to
balance
it
out
nicely
m
medium
body
dry
moderate
carbonation
prost
poured
a
gorgeous
cloudy
gold
with
three
fingers
of
fluffy
white
head
that
grew
higher
as
it
sat
quite
nice
scents
of
sour
green
apple
lemon
juice
barnyard
funk
white
wine
lactic
sour
hints
of
pear
very
faint
hints
of
bubblegum
touches
of
oak
slight
yeasty
funk
funknotes
become
more
assertive
as
the
beer
warms
and
as
it
warms
further
a
bit
of
honey
comes
through
very
nice
deep
complex
sour
and
appetizing
with
a
range
of
scents
flavor
begins
with
a
massive
hit
of
sour
lemon
juice
crab
apple
a
bit
of
funky
musty
flavors
some
vinegar
notes
some
slight
hits
of
lemon
rind
quite
acidic
a
tiny
hit
of
herbal
bitterness
and
oak
as
the
sip
finishes
extremely
dry
finish
the
beer
showcases
sourness
over
all
else
the
fruit
on
the
nose
is
not
all
that
present
in
the
taste
its
certainly
a
very
very
sour
beer
well
blended
with
an
excellent
character
for
those
who
love
sours
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
a
very
drying
finish
and
a
puckering
sourness
refreshing
tart
and
drying
making
you
want
to
take
sip
after
sip
overall
this
is
an
excellent
geuze
its
a
bit
single
note
not
incredibly
complex
in
its
flavor
but
the
flavor
is
good
a
nice
lively
sour
that
puckers
the
mouth
and
works
with
the
mouthfeel
to
make
a
wonderfully
refreshing
beer
highly
recommended
o
one
hell
of
a
beer
very
enjoyable
and
tart
and
ultimately
a
highly
recommended
beer
for
anyone
a
fan
of
sours
odefinitely
need
to
let
this
beer
warm
up
to
room
temperature
maybe
age
will
move
more
of
the
funk
from
the
nose
to
the
taste
overall
this
beer
is
top
notch
lactic
sour
funk
that
is
well
balanced
and
leaves
you
wanting
more
my
glass
was

no

o
it
lives
up
to
the
hype
great
geuze
recommended
i
am
rating
the
1999
ed
mainly
because
i
like
to
score
a
beer
the
highest
mark
that
i
have
ever
given
it
even
if
i
have
had
multiple
samples
that
are
inferior
i
feel
it
is
unfair
to
average
out
all
of
my
scores
for
special
lambics
like
this
ive
had
dozens
of
normal
3f
geuze
bottles
but
the
1999
is
by
far
the
best
mouthfeel
is
dry
but
thick
overall
quite
good
but
probably
wont
spend
the
money
again
o
pretty
much
everything
id
want
from
the
style
terrific
beer
consumed
the
glass
over
the
course
of
an
hour
or
so
and
have
enjoyed
it
changing
with
the
temperature
will
be
buying
again
its
taken
me
way
the
hell
too
long
to
finally
get
a
crack
at
this
stuff
just
sayin
it
pours
a
slightly
murky
gold
topped
by
a
finger
or
so
of
lightly
offwhite
froth
the
nose
comprises
lemon
zest
lime
zest
apricot
light
sour
pineapple
very
light
cracked
wheat
and
a
morethanhealthy
helping
of
brettlike
funk
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
the
tarter
fruit
notes
covered
oer
by
a
thick
pall
of
musty
funk
or
is
it
funky
must
creating
a
deeplylayered
liquid
cake
of
complexity
at
any
given
moment
you
can
get
some
sour
lemon
some
swissesque
cheese
some
straight
cobweb
funky
magic
or
grassflowers
sometimes
all
of
it
will
come
at
you
at
once
those
are
the
great
times
the
body
is
a
lightleaning
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
drying
finish
overall
a
damn
fine
gueuze
one
that
deserves
the
reputation
it
commands
overall
very
good
to
great
beer
but
i
think
id
have
to
go
with
tilquin
or
cantillon
overall
i
might
however
choose
this
one
for
the
ease
of
drink
it
is
certainly
worth
a
try
o
a
classic
in
every
sense
hard
to
find
any
faults
and
im
going
to
enjoy
the
development
of
this
particular
vintage
i
have
a
couple
of
cases
of
this
and
look
forward
to
trying
another
next
year
odworth
the
20
750ml
i
drank
this
beer
very
young
i
may
need
to
grab
another
and
throw
her
in
the
cellar
just
a
very
earthy
natural
medley
of
flavors
bottom
line
pucker
up
this
one
is
sour
o
refreshing
sour
and
honestly
a
good
example
if
not
one
of
the
top
geuzes
readily
available
in
my
area
will
buy
again
an
recommend
to
any
one
who
is
curious
o
wow
a
nice
bite
yet
very
refined
can
wait
to
get
more
of
this
once
again
im
extremely
joyous
to
be
drinking
a
drie
fonteinen
and
though
this
may
have
developed
some
off
flavors
due
to
the
room
temp
aging
surprisingly
they
dont
take
away
from
the
beer
but
add
more
cheesy
funk
which
is
quite
welcome
its
the
beauty
of
lambics
enjoying
their
longevity
and
the
transformations
that
occur
in
its
duration
on
an
unusually
cool
july
day
this
is
perfect
the
scent
is
barnyard
funky
taste
is
tart
and
bright
with
an
incredibly
dry
finish
i
know
that
most
think
of
this
as
an
ideal
summer
beer
but
for
me
its
the
perfect
autumn
drink
highly
recommended
for
a
lazy
sunday

that
football

overall
its

the

contrast

didnt
exactly
seem
to
match
what
the
beer
tasted
like
as
opposed
to
for

the
smell
and
taste
of
an
apple
coming
together
they
both
were
completely
different

in
this

awesome
beer
it
was
great
to
share
and
talk
about
with

i
recommend
it
and
definitely

with
someone

to
try

geuze
jd
overall
a
very
enjoyable
sour
appearance
is
hazy
golden
orange
with
bright
white
foam
that
dissipates
rapidly
smell
is
of
lemon
and
funk
diaper
funk
a
touch
metallic
not
overpowering
in
the
aroma
department
flavor
is
delicious
funk
a
little
bit
of
sweetness
and
moderate
acidity
some
lemon
rind
and
nectarine
the
sour
lingers
more
than
the
tilquin
that
im
drinking
side
by
side
would
like
some
more
bubbles
but
the
lower
level
of
carb
is
probably
true
to
style
a
delicious
gueuze
this
one
was
bottled
18
months
ago
cork
comes
easy
with
a
huge
plop
lots
of
carbonation
creates
a
unstable
white
foam
and
a
clear
orange
body
smells
is
funk
and
horse
blanket
citric
apricot
taste
is
sourness
funk
leathery
some
fruitiness
very
spritzy
and
light
on
the
tongue
nice
and
refreshing
i
had
this
before
and
liked
it
but
this
time
it
really
knocked
it
out
of
the
ballpark
the
age
has
done
it
really
well
really
not
too
sour
and
this
great
carbonation
i
consider
myself
lucky
to
pick
up
something
like
this
any
time
i
want
o
i
dont
know
how
much
bottles
of
this
go
for
in
the
states
but
id
pick
it
up
again
for
sure
overall
fantastic
beer
on
par
with
or
maybe
even
setting
the
standard
for
an
oude
gueuze
great
structure
acid
levels
sour
flavors
long
finish
just
tasty
im
diggin
it
if
im
being
picky
id
love
this
brew
to
throw
a
juicy
bag
around
its
neck
and
take
strut
around
if
you
know
whata
mean
overall
a
solid
straightforward
rendition
of
the
style
overall
top
notch
stuff
nothing
really
else
to
say
consistently
good
and
easy
enough
to
get
a
hold
of
i
always
keep
a
few
bottles
around
overall
a
tasty
brew
surprised
by
the
lack
of
tartness
in
this
expected
more
sour
still
i
enjoy
it
a
bottle
at
a
small
watering
hole
in
bruges
this
beer
is
dark
yellow
in
color
with
lots
of
lively
carbonation
aroma
and
taste
is
similar
typical
belgian
geuze
funky
leathery
tobacco
leaf
with
a
very
dry
finish
easy
to
drink
sour
just
a
notch
below
cantillons
version
for
overall
funk
and
sour
complexity
o
an
absolutely
fantastic
geuze
good
sourness
decent
complexity
and
the
wild
fermentation
has
done
a
number
on
this
beer
o
an
excellent
readily
available
gueuze
the
level
of
sourness
really
hits
the
spot
but
the
barrel
character
is
very
light
overall
really
good
gueuze
this
is
one
of
the
classics
for
a
reason
after
having
many
many
more
bottles
of
this
the
variation
is
lovely
sometimes
its
much
funkier
sometimes
its
much
more
tart
but
its
always
delicious
i
still
think
i
prefer
cantillons
original
gueuze
to
this
one
but
hey
i
can
still
find
this
stuff
on
the
shelves
occasionally
win
o
my
first
gueuze
so
im
trying
to
play
it
cool
here
but
based
on
what
ive
heard
and
read
this
is
a
pretty
damn
good
example
of
the
style
i
have
been
leery
of
the
sour
beer
for
quite
some
time
now
but
this
was
delightful
overall
a
topnotch
gueuze
much
more
of
a
refined
citrus
and
balanced
malt
profile
than
some
of
the
funkier
lambics
something
you
could
drink
for
hours
and
keep
discovering
something
new
about
it
overall
this
is
an
incredibly
complex
beer
and
i
personally
think
it
takes
a
whole
330ml
bottle
to
fully
process
its
complexity
a
fantastic
guezue
o
the
classic
sour
beer
this
is
definately
a
starting
off
point
for
someone
who
wants
to
try
what
a
sour
should
be
i
enjoy
this
beer
frequently
carbonation
seems
a
bit
high
this
is
one
fantastic
beer
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
really
come
together
and
make
it
fun
to
quaff
o
enjoyable
and
refreshing
but
hard
to
find
at
a
decent
price
im
glad
i
tryed
it
but
no
where
near
as
complex
as
i
was
hoping
it
was
nice
to
have
a
geuze
that
was
devoid
of
the
dreaded
acetonenail
polish
remover
flavorim
looking
at
you
experimental
cassis
o
good
beer
worth
trying
at
least
once
o
really
a
great
gueuze
that
is
tart
yet
has
a
lot
amount
of
earthy
funk
it
reminds
me
of
a
tarter
and
funkier
version
of
orval
which
is
a
good
thing
lots
of
carbonation
as
well
curious
to
see
what
aging
does
to
this
o
an
excellent
geuze
although
i
prefer
cantillon
classic
a
rather
drinkable
instance
of
the
style
with
a
still
healthy
nod
to
the
sassy
elements
that
define
the
style
acid
funk
and
um
jazz
anyways
complex
sure
as
the
individual
often
suspect
flavours
do
well
to
come
together
and
please
a
doubting
palate
however
if
youre
looking
for
a
wallop
of
that
ol
acid
andor
funk
maybe
head
on
over
to
the
cantillon
section
eh
solid
geuze
overall
probably
my
favorite
gueuze
that
i
have
tried
recently
havent
drank
too
many
beers
from
this
style
but
i
have
been
drinking
my
fair
share
of
this
beer
style
lately
and
this
beer
is
the
most
memorable
so
far
i
am
becoming
more
of
a
fan
of
this
style
with
every
beer
that
i
try
this
is
an
excellent
beer
i
love
sours
and
this
is
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
had
thanks
again
to
douglasjamjak
for
this
awesome
extra
overall
it
is
clear
why
3f
and
cantillon
are
the
heavyweights
of
the
belgian
sour
category
this
is
a
terrific
example
of
the
style
i
had
this
one
fairly
fresh
and
have
another
in
the
cellar
im
very
interested
to
see
how
this
develops
over
the
next
decade
or
so
thanks
to
a
buddy
for
picking
this
up
for
me
12
oz
bottle
pours
a
hazy
golden
orange
with
lots
of
head
taste
isnt
overpowering
sour
but
just
the
right
amount
some
lemon
and
apple
go
with
the
tart
finish
every
mouthful
my
tongue
screams
for
me
so
easy
to
drink
a
delicious
beer
wish
i
had
more
access
to
these
style
of
beers
overall
damn
good
gueze
but
i
like
tilquin
better
overall
a
nice
beer
better
as
it
warms
up
o
definitely
very
tasty
but
this
is
a
big
funky
sour
beer
and
not
for
the
faint
on
heart
or
palate
glad
i
have
another
one
waiting
i
still
feel
as
if
this
is
a
new
style
to
me
i
have
been
sitting
on
several
bottles
of
this
particular
beer
from
3
different
bottlings
but
given
its
reputation
i
wanted
to
try
a
few
others
first
in
order
to
educate
my
palate
i
can
see
why
this
one
is
so
highly
regarded
the
way
the
brewer
makes
such
a
sour
beer
so
pleasant
to
drink
is
something
of
a
magic
trick
3f
is
at
the
top
of
the
game
i
know
some
prefer
the
intense
sourness
of
cantillon
but
this
stuff
is
really
really
good
and
nicely
balanced
on
the
palate
o
this
was
a
narrow
second
place
finisher
and
a
damn
close
finish
at
that
but
at
the
same
token
this
is
the
only
one
where
id
attempt
to
finish
an
entire
largeformat
bottle
solo
refreshing
easy
to
drink
and
challenging
all
at
the
same
time
o
another
very
good
gueze
taste
is
a
little
different
from
the
mainline
but
very
interesting
and
drinkable
nonetheless
i
think
this
guy
would
stand
out
more
on
his
own
but
compared
to
his
peers
hes
just
another
tasty
gueuze
o
my
girlfriend
described
this
as
a
chemically
soaked
warhead
and
im
inclined
to
agree
ive
had
many
sours
before
that
i
enjoy
such
as
rodenbach
duchesse
monks
cafe
flemish
and
st
louis
fond
tradition
but
this
is
way
too
much
and
i
thought
jolly
pumpkins
beers
were
insane
i
understand
that
these
beers
are
supposed
to
taste
like
this
but
the
reason
i
give
it
such
a
low
score
is
because
of
the
ridiculous
price
tag
of
13
99
for
a
12
7
oz
bottle
which
i
understand
to
be
not
uncommon
mouthfeel
not
searingly
acidic
nor
bone
dry
mediumlight
body
with
lively
carbonation
sweet
and
sour
finish
mediumlow
tannin
plays
a
big
role
in
this
beer
long
funky
aftertaste
o
i
had
a
cantillon
geuze
sidebyside
with
this
beer
and
in
my
opinion
the
cantillion
blew
it
away
i
wish
this
beer
was
a
bit
more
sour
funky
and
carbonated
but
i
would
certainly
like
to
get
another
to
cellar
try
as
i
might
this
style
of
brewingbottling
and
blending
still
leaves
me
unimpressed
somewhat
i
want
to
embrace
the
idea
of
lambic
beers
and
geuze
but
struggle
to
feel
the
wonderous
excitment
other
beer
geeks
get
from
having
beers
from
this
stable
or
other
lambic
breweries
o
such
a
great
balanced
gueuze
the
acidity
is
very
mellow
at
least
in
this
vintage
compared
to
beers
like
cantillon
classic
or
tilquin
but
it
lets
some
great
mineral
and
wheat
character
out
its
a
fonteinengeuze
my
first
geuze
i
believe
ive
often
contemplated
picking
a
bottle
of
this
up
glad
i
finally
got
to
try
it
o
this
is
just
an
amazing
beer
pretty
pricey
for
how
small
the
bottle
is
but
the
flavor
really
makes
up
for
that
very
delicious
o
best
geuze
i
have
ever
had
have
never
had
a
cantillon
but
i
got
one
aging
so
who
knows
but
this
is
by
far
the
best
i
have
had
to
date
everything
a
gueuze
should
be
it
pours
a
pale
pale
straw
color
hazy
with
an
average
white
head
with
decent
retention
the
nose
is
stright
lemon
juice
from
concentrate
like
the
little
green
bottle
in
the
fridge
that
i
sometimes
put
on
steamed
spinach
it
is
acidic
and
tart
and
light
in
both
malt
and
hops
it
taste
equally
fruity
as
the
nose
with
lemon
being
the
predominant
flavor
lots
of
acid
this
is
pretty
puckery
no
sweetness
at
all
like
a
raw
lemonade
or
something
the
feel
is
great
dry
in
the
mouth
effervescent
carbonation
and
a
lighter
body
this
is
a
sharing
bottle
though
because
of
the
acid
content
its
through
the
roof
still
a
brilliant
example
of
the
style
overall
wonderful
beer
nice
qualities
all
around
and
a
good
example
of
the
style
enjoyed
this
immensely
oa
nice
gueuze
with
great
flavor
and
body
o
overall
good
but
not
great
its
not
as
sour
as
some
other
gueuzes
i
have
had
it
also
didnt
have
the
degree
of
flavor
complexity
that
others
do
i
think
the
lack
of
carbonation
hurt
this
one
that
being
said
i
still
really
enjoyed
it
i
just
wouldnt
rush
to
purchase
it
again
one
more
thing
i
really
didnt
get
any
of
the
funkbarnyard
characters
that
others
have
said
were
so
prominent
in
this
beer
i
am
not
docking
it
points
on
that
though
as
i
tend
to
prefer
the
sour
notes
to
the
funk
ones
just
thought
id
mention
it
though
othis
has
served
as
my
favorite
standard
gueuze
for
awhile
now
it
is
the
perfect
balance
between
bright
lactic
acidity
and
funk
cant
wait
to
let
these
750s
sit
in
a
dark
corner
of
the
cellar
for
a
couple
years
im
pretty
stoked
i
still
have
a
golden
blend
in
the
fridge
i
want
to
learn
more
about
funky
brews
and
3f
is
a
great
place
to
start
o
wonderfully
crisp
and
tart
mouthfeel
smooth
and
easy
damn
it
where
the
hell
did
that
fruit
fly
come
from
get
out
of
my
beer
overall
i
think
this
was
an
absolute
treat
to
have
and
i
wish
i
could
find
it
again
im
sure
this
would
continue
to
be
great
if
not
improve
with
more
aging
if
american
wilds
flanders
reds
or
gueuzes
have
even
slightly
peaked
your
interest
and
you
can
get
your
hands
on
this
give
it
a
try
i
also
have
to
say
damn
its
nice
to
have
a
flavorful
and
complex
beer
that
doesnt
start
to
get
me
drunk

roughly

nicely

fantastic

managed
to
smell
great
in

of
lack

definitely
a

very

too
bad
i
will
stick
with
cantillon

for

as
soon
as
i
pulled
back
the
cage
around
the
cork
without
even
touching
the
cork
this
pops
like
no
other
just
like
a
champagne
botle
and
it
gushes
out
everywhere
and
when
poured
its
a
hazed
golden
hue
which
leaves
a
creamy
three
finger
head
and
lacing
everywherethe
smell
is
sweaty
sockswet
soillemon
zest
and
freshly
cut
grassthe
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
rather
creamy
and
on
taste
it
tastes
just
abit
young
for
a
gueuze
so
be
good
to
age
and
i
get
hints
of
lemon
zestsunrise
limesmandarinbarnyard
funk
and
finished
with
a
herbal
apple
candy
sourness
and
overall
its
nice
but
like
i
stated
previously
this
is
one
to
age
cheers
o
i
liked
this
but
it
was
only
mediocre
compared
to
some
of
the
other
geuzes
that
ive
had
the
cantillon
classic
geuze
i
had
right
before
this
one
definitely
had
less
carbonation
but
a
lot
more
flavor
i
would
try
this
again
but
there
are
other
geuzes
that
id
take
over
this
would
love
to
try
it
with
more
age
on
it
overall
just
an
excellent
gueuze
maybe
a
bit
more
approachable
for
some
as
it
is
a
combination
of
many
clean
recognizable
flavors
rather
than
bizarre
funkiness
however
its
really
tart
o
a
very
nice
gueze
displaying
a
very
nice
blend
that
balances
notes
of
oak
and
sour
funk
beautifully
really
enjoy
this
one
not
overly
sour
kinda
just
right
maybe
a
touch
more
tartness
and
id
be
in
love
edited
because
i
have
now
tried
more
spontaneous
geuze
and
this
one
just
absolutely
dwarves
the
others
i
have
tried
so
far
slightly
hazy
golden
color
with
a
huge
fluffy
bubbly
white
head
that
takes
a
while
to
fall
huge
lemon
and
tart
fruit
nose
with
lots
of
funk
to
fill
in
the
ends
bubbly
tart
fruity
flavor
with
lemons
and
sour
cherries
coming
to
mind
phenolic
and
funk
in
spades
counter
the
sweet
and
tart
fruit
form
every
sip
medium
to
light
body
with
a
spirited
level
of
carbonation
and
a
sour
tart
bubbly
mouthfeel
very
nice
gueze
with
light
tart
fruit
and
lots
of
funk
overall
this
is
the
definition
of
gueuze
better
and
better
with
each
year
of
age
as
with
many
i
prefer
the
aroma
to
the
overall
flavor
profile
but
that
is
not
saying
it
wasnt
fantastic
definitely
worth
seeking
out
and
hiding
from
yourself
for
as
long
as
humanly
possible
all
in
all
this
is
a
fine
beer
and
better
than
many
other
gueuzes
the
fact
that
its
widely
available
nowadays
is
a
miracle
of
modern
beer
advocacy
that
being
said
is
it
still
a
mere
shadow
of
cantillons
wonder
yup
m
bone
dry
crisp
dangerously
drinkable
overall
really
fantastic
and
i
enjoy
it
more
then
the
cantillon
oude
gueuze
overall
its
a
winner
o
all
around
a
very
solid
and
enjoyable
beer
armand
does
it
again
a
work
in
progress
to
appreciate
the
incredible
complexity
of
geuze
not
sure
why
its
called
the
champagne
of
belgians
because
fizz
is
the
one
thing
missing
otherwise
theres
a
cornucopia
of
flavors
in
here
that
recombine
in
surprising
ways
to
make
me
want
to
say
silly
things
like
a
lemon
and
wine
sauce
for
mussels
my
awe
includes
a
bit
of
confusion
but
theres
no
denying
its
a
deep
beer
drinkability
is
pretty
good
the
sweetness
makes
it
more
approachable
than
others
but
i
prefer
much
more
pucker
i
gotta
say
regardless
of
how
heralded
a
blender
they
are
its
not
the
most
impressive
geuze
a
most
barnyardy
beer
indeed
surprisingly
high
level
of
champagnelike
carbonation
on
this
straw
colored
gueuze
a
little
tingly
as
it
goes
down
my
buddy
david
nailed
it
when
he
said
horse
blanket
on
the
nose
funky
wild
yeasty
scents
mingle
with
a
bit
of
breadiness
tart
and
dry
on
the
finish
goes
great
with
epoisses
o
very
good
this
is
like
drinking
a
barn
at
first
its
full
of
hay
and
sweat
then
other
flavors
and
aromas
come
out
its
so
complex
id
say
its
probably
the
most
complex
beer
ive
ever
had
i
described
rye
acid
allspice
nuts
wheat
fruit
i
mean
what
else
can
come
out
of
this
thing
it
was
quite
a
ride
and
a
treat
a
special
occasion
beer
if
there
ever
was
one
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
soft
even
with
all
of
that
visible
carbonation
it
smoothly
delivers
the
waves
of
flavor
here
overall
this
is
a
masterfullyblended
bottle
of
gueuze
i
still
very
much
prefer
cantillon
classic
gueuze
but
this
is
excellent
o
excellent
drinkability
perfect
geuze
the
drinkability
on
this
is
crazy
its
very
tasty
and
not
so
sour
that
it
becomes
painful
to
drink
a
great
summer
beer
on
the
whole
i
prefer
the
cantillon
gueuze
but
this
is
still
excellent
o
easily
the
best
ive
had
of
the
style
nearly
perfect
375
ml
bottle
bottled
18
nov
2010
pours
a
clear
light
amber
with
a
small
white
head
that
has
good
retention
and
leaves
a
decent
amount
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
earthy
with
a
mineral
note
there
is
also
lemon
apple
apricot
and
a
light
mushroom
note
the
initial
taste
has
a
light
sweetness
with
some
lemon
earthy
bretty
funk
some
apple
and
hint
of
mushroom
the
finish
is
dry
and
tart
light
body
medium
carbonation
quite
dry
overall
o
wow
this
is
fantastic
stuff
aged
or
not
this
is
fantastic
originally
reviewed
04262011
o
one
of
my
favorite
beers
of
2012
so
far
this
beer
is
so
easy
to
find
and
is
reasonably
priced
which
make
it
that
much
better
ive
had
several
of
the
armand
4
boon
and
cantillon
gueuzes
and
to
be
honest
i
think
the
drie
fonteinen
is
probably
the
best
for
the
money
cantillon
is
better
but
with
it
becoming
so
hard
to
find
3f
is
definitely
where
its
at
o
excellent
gueuze
im
still
learning
on
this
style
but
excellent
none
the
less
very
carbonated
and
fizzy
very
earthy
soil
smelling
tart
sharp
clean
and
quick
extremely
dry
with
muted
and
mellow
flavors
not
as
vibrant
and
bright
musty
earthy
potting
soil
dominates
in
a
good
way
very
very
drinkable
a
special
treat
but
i
think
i
prefer
this
beer
with
less
than
12
years
of
age
on
it
beer
is
mediumlight
in
body
with
very
high
carbonation
that
foams
this
up
immediately
on
the
palate
resultant
mouthfeel
is
slightly
prickly
at
first
then
very
quickly
smooth
and
creamy
finish
is
dry
from
residual
sugars
and
also
a
slight
bit
sticky
its
hard
to
explain
in
words
how
perfectly
executed
this
is
a
perfect
balance
of
everything
that
i
typically
look
for
in
a
geuze
im
not
sure
what
else
to
say
this
beer
is
nearly
perfect
cost
20
for
a
750
ml
bottle
i
am
just
starting
to
get
into
the
gueuze
style
and
this
is
one
of
the
best
ive
had
yet
o
another
great
gueuze
but
i
like
it
with
a
more
more
acidity
to
it
would
never
pass
it
up
though
o
a
very
nice
gueuze
probably
one
of
the
best
you
can
get
in
the
us
this
beer
is
very
approachable
and
would
make
a
nice
intro
the
the
style
for
anyone
interested
in
sours
i
might
have
scored
this
slightly
higher
but
drinking
it
alongside
the
golden
blend
really
highlighted
how
much
more
complex
the
golden
blend
is
this
is
an
excellent
gueuze
but
if
you
try
this
one
and
like
it
you
really
need
to
try
the
golden
blend
as
well
a
great
geuze
ive
yet
to
have
one
of
the
vintage
or
season
geuzes
but
this
is
always
a
winner
o
it
just
doesnt
get
much
better
than
this
one
of
the
best
gueuzes
in
the
world
extremely
drinkable
o
a
very
good
gueuze
overall
it
has
just
the
right
amount
of
tart
and
sour
charactersvery
present
but
in
small
enough
amounts
that
its
very
refreshing
of
course
one
of
the
true
standards
is
a
great
beer
3f
mouthfeel
is
always
spot
on
i
generally
prefer
a
little
more
sour
and
less
bleu
cheese
but
this
one
is
still
great
and
glad
i
can
occasionally
find
it
on
the
shelves
overall
as
a
sour
newbie
i
was
surprised
how
much
i
enjoyed
this
beer
not
overly
sour
by
any
means
so
it
is
still
very
approachable
for
someone
like
myself
beyond
that
there
is
plenty
of
character
and
complexity
here
for
any
beer
fan
to
appreciate
this
was
probably
my
favorite
gueuze
of
the
day
thanks
again
for
the
christening
gents
good
times
ive
had
guezes
before
this
one
and
was
aware
what
to
look
for
and
thus
far
this
beer
is
the
best
as
far
as
getting
the
funkiness
down
good
focus
here
o
happy
but
a
bit
surprised
by
this
beer
as
it
was
more
subtle
than
i
would
have
imagined
for
whatever
reason
delicious
but
i
think
ill
let
my
second
bottle
age
a
bit
more
would
definitely
purchase
again
o
this
beer
is
really
incredible
i
have
had
it
a
few
times
before
but
sitting
down
and
reviewing
it
has
really
made
me
appreciate
it
much
more
essentially
flawless
subtle
and
complex
not
overly
sour
not
overly
anything
really
i
need
to
pick
up
some
more
outstanding
well
balanced
in
all
aspects
the
aftertaste
is
prominent
long
lasting
mouth
puckering
tartness
that
is
a
perfect
grand
finale
for
such
an
exquisite
beer
also
the
mouthfeel
puts
this
beer
over
the
top
for
me
pours
a
beautiful
light
gold
color
with
a
tad
of
haze
a
mostly
white
one
finger
head
tops
the
beer
and
very
quickly
dissipates
heavenly
smells
of
tartness
sourness
and
oak
comprise
a
great
nose
first
sip
for
a
second
is
kind
of
sweet
then
like
an
avalanche
a
wave
of
puckering
sourness
hits
there
is
a
great
mix
of
flavor
with
the
oak
adding
a
balancing
dimension
still
some
slight
sweetness
through
out
the
tart
finish
stands
out
mouthfeel
is
top
notch
too
as
it
is
near
perfectly
carbonated
damn
good
damn
good
overall
what
a
great
beer
ive
heard
this
beer
talked
up
quite
a
bit
and
it
did
not
disappoint
i
was
blown
away
by
this
beer
and
will
have
to
track
down
more
for
sure
i
wish
the
carbonation
issues
werent
present
i
feel
like
this
beer
is
only
lacking
in
that
one
area
i
will
seek
this
out
again
for
a
new
take
o
excellent
geuze
mustfunk
presence
is
nice
and
much
more
subtle
than
something
like
hanssenns
oude
geuze
which
i
also
really
enjoy
leading
to
a
more
refreshing
drinking
experience
than
some
other
geuzes
bottle
to
oversized
snifter
looks
good
orange
and
opaque
smells
great
very
fruity
with
oak
notes
present
tastes
good
too
a
lighter
dry
gueuze
that
is
quite
unique
mouthfeel
is
good
as
well
overall
a
tasty
gueuze
but
pricy
as
they
generally
are
o
overall
this
is
a
good
gueuze
i
felt
the
nose
was
a
bit
lacking
and
could
do
without
the
strong
yeast
finish
but
that
crisp
dry
finish
is
a
great
quality
stuff
is
really
enjoyable
but
not
my
favourite
overall
a
very
flavorful
geuze
classic
benchmark
quality
gueuze
overall
i
will
seek
this
beer
out
a
new
favorite
definitely
want
to
try
it
with
a
lamb
dish
or
seafood
pasta
it
drinks
like
a
pinot
noir
when
its
room
temp
or
like
a
gewurztraminer
when
chilled
yum
this
was
the
second
beer
i
tried
from
3f
and
i
was
thoroughly
impressed
with
this
after
trying
their
2009
kriek
which
was
beyond
godly
o
4
all
in
all
was
very
impressed
with
this
and
pleased
that
is
was
in
no
way
similar
to
the
cantillon
geuze
i
had
the
week
prior
o
this
is
a
fantastic
geuze
tons
of
tartness
with
just
the
right
amount
of
funk
to
pair
with
it
4
5

a
top
notch
beer
i
just
wish
i
had
semiregular
access
to
it
for
special
occasions
and
such
bottle
dated
may
2008
overall
solid
overall
with
a
great
depth
looking
for
a
little
more
tartness
oak
is
a
bit
overpowering
in
the
long
run
still
its
damn
tasty
o
very
interesting
tart
and
tasty
o
great
gueuze
wish
i
could
drink
this
more
often
this
is
unlike
any
gueuze
that
i
have
encountered
its
a
great
sour
and
its
pretty
unique
this
particular
bottle
seemed
to
be
lacking
carbonation
but
it
was
still
good
o
overall
its
a
very
nice
geuze
thats
readily
available
and
affordable
i
would
recommend
it
to
someone
who
hasnt
had
it
this
is
my
first
chance
to
enjoy
a
real
belgain
geuze
it
is
pretty
much
what
i
wxpwcted
and
hope
for
funk
and
vinegar
light
fruit
in
the
nose
like
apricot
and
grapefruit
the
brut
style
carbonation
was
spot
on
like
a
good
dry
champange
taste
was
solid
but
not
mind
blowing
russian
river
sours
carry
more
complexity
which
is
really
what
we
are
looking
for
right
great
mouthfeel
it
help
counteract
any
distaste
for
the
vinegar
taste
overall
i
would
like
top
climb
up
the
ladder
of
this
brewery
and
try
some
armand
and
the
kreik
enjoyed
a
2009
bottle
into
a
drie
fonteinen
lambic
glass
looks
dark
gold
to
copper
head
is
white
and
medium
fizzy
aroma
is
great
earthy
funk
peach
pear
sour
and
tart
the
flavor
follows
suit
with
lots
of
citrus
acid
fruity
but
dry
brett
oak
grassy
field
like
and
super
balanced
geuze
here
reminds
me
of
the
girardin
a
bit
super
balanced
and
crisp
ridiculously
drinkable
this
is
a
wonderfully
complex
beer
it
is
layered
flavorful
refreshing
balanced
and
very
drinkable
o
so
much
funk
even
george
clinton
would
be
jealous
but
the
balance
makes
this
exceptional
a
great
introductory
geuze
and
its
easy
to
see
why
its
a
favorite
among
lambic
connoisseurs
as
well
overal
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
the
taste
is
really
tart
from
the
get
go
but
it
levels
off
nicely
the
carbonation
is
spot
on
opens
with
a
nice
pop
and
pours
with
a
huge
white
billowy
head
it
recedes
to
about
a
centimeter
of
denser
head
there
is
some
foam
that
remains
on
the
side
of
the
glass
but
not
much
bright
and
clear
straw
color
the
carbonation
is
quite
visible
lots
of
bubbles
rising
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
aroma
is
bitter
lemon
rind
and
tart
green
apple
a
bit
of
musty
mild
oak
but
not
much
flavor
is
really
nice
light
refreshing
tart
apple
citrus
rind
mildly
horsey
mouthfeel
is
extremely
light
almost
champagne
like
refreshing
light
dry
and
effervescent
overall
this
beer
is
outstanding
i
really
enjoy
this
gueuze
on
par
with
if
not
better
than
cantillon
o
absolutely
impressed
with
this
beer
outstanding
from
start
to
finish
glad
i
got
to
try
it
and
will
definitely
grab
more
if
possible
o
this
has
good
drinkability
it
goes
down
easy
and
has
a
really
nice
flavor
to
it
i
could
easily
have
a
few
glasses
of
this
in
a
night
overall
i
thought
it
was
a
really
nice
beer
and
a
good
empale
of
the
style
i
really
enjoyed
the
funkiness
and
dryness
that
came
in
towards
the
back
end
of
the
flavor
i
recommend
trying
this
one
out
i
would
buy
it
again
this
beer
was
a
treat
to
enjoy
very
crisp
and
refreshing
beer
with
lots
of
great
flavor
cant
wait
to
see
how
my
other
bottle
evolves
over
time
o
for
a
sour
it
aint
so
bad
it
is
just
not
my
style
maybe
i
will
be
a
believer
after
tasting
enough
of
these
ogreat
beer
very
well
balanced
truthfully
dont
believe
this
is
an
amazing
beer
but
believe
it
is
perfectly
balanced
for
how
it
should
be
do
wish
it
was
a
bit
cheaper
though
so
i
can
drink
more
definitely
worth
the
try
o
been
looking
forward
to
trying
this
one
for
a
while
and
it
didnt
disappoint
seems
like
every
aspect
of
this
beer
is
near
perfect
the
folks
at
fonteinen
and
convinced
me
to
make
the
effort
to
seek
out
others
in
their
line
up
highly
recommended
o
overall
the
smell
is
the
show
on
this
one
and
delights
me
as
i
sipped
the
brew
i
found
myself
digging
the
other
aspects
more
but
the
dryness
is
a
bit
much
for
me
i
love
the
smooth
middle
tart
before
the
dryness
settles
in
i
look
forward
to
exploring
more
in
the
style
and
nod
my
head
to
you
drabmuh
for
the
intro
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
with
two
fingers
of
dense
white
foam
minimal
lacing
smells
of
barnyard
funk
lemon
peel
and
wet
hay
taste
starts
out
tart
with
big
lemon
notes
musty
wet
horse
blanket
and
oak
round
out
the
flavor
profile
the
finish
is
dry
with
a
lingering
tartness
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
leaning
toward
full
with
a
prickly
level
of
carbonation
this
has
become
one
of
my
absolute
favorites
great
tart
funky
characteristics
and
an
exquisitely
dry
finish
recommended
drinkability
and
overall
impression
this
is
a
pleasure
to
drink
and
one
sip
follows
another
quite
easily
as
one
tries
to
sort
out
the
complex
components
of
the
flavor
its
also
quite
nice
to
just
pick
up
the
glass
and
take
a
sniff
or
two
of
the
aroma
to
try
and
sort
it
out
as
well
an
appropriate
combination
of
two
words
to
describe
this
beer
is
complex
subtlety
my
overall
impression
of
this
beer
is
that
this
is
clearly
among
the
best
im
certainly
glad
ive
already
had
several
other
first
rate
guezes
as
i
dont
think
what
i
have
learned
from
them
helps
me
better
appreciate
the
outstanding
qualities
of
this
beer
verdict
outstanding
geuze
wonderfully
tart
without
being
overly
vinegary
bubbly
like
champagne
and
nice
complex
fruit
and
wood
flavors
a
must
try
o
though
i
miss
the
palategripping
tartness
of
the
hanssens
and
could
definitely
do
with
a
little
less
dryness
this
gueuze
is
a
keeper
good
variety
of
classic
flavors
and
aromas
as
well
as
a
nearly
perfect
body
excluding
the
aforementioned
dryness
well
worth
seeking
out
to
me
this
contains
similar
yeasty
and
bitter
texture
to
orval
but
has
a
lambic
recipe
that
makes
it
far
more
different
its
not
as
sour
as
other
gueuzes
see
cantillon
but
it
is
definitely
a
standout
in
sours
in
terms
of
balance
and
quality
this
manages
to
have
different
shades
of
sourness
sweetness
bitterness
and
spiciness
all
at
the
same
time
a
wonderful
beer
i
will
seek
out
more
from
this
brewery
in
the
future
overall
satisfactory
o
i
was
more
excited
and
pleased
by
this
beer
at
the
outset
than
i
was
toward
the
end
especially
considering
my
illadvised
final
pour
from
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
still
having
had
fruit
lambics
but
never
a
gueuze
this
was
a
cool
experience
whoever
drank
such
a
beer
for
the
first
time
long
ago
no
doubt
really
wanted
to
cop
a
buzz
that
could
be
taken
wrong
but
i
just
appreciate
the
wild
untamed
spoiled
nature
of
this
beer
glad
i
got
it
this
is
apparently
about
as
young
as
you
can
get
this
stuff
so
i
inevitably
will
consider
this
sort
of
a
baseline
re
future
lambic
and
gueuze
explorations
pours
a
honey
color
with
a
one
finger
white
head
very
cloudy
in
appearance
with
minimal
lacing
and
carbonation
the
smell
is
pretty
amazing
barnyard
funk
spices
citrus
hay
very
complex
and
very
aromatic
taste
has
the
same
profile
as
the
nose
and
is
equally
amazing
amazing
funk
taste
feel
is
tart
with
great
carbonation
overall
an
amazing
beer
conclusion
as
expected
this
is
an
outstanding
gueuze
i
still
favor
girardin
1884
black
label
over
this
and
want
to
try
them
side
by
side
at
some
point
i
doubt
i
will
ever
be
able
to
fully
appreciate
the
complexity
of
this
style
but
i
hope
to
deepen
my
understanding
by
drinking
a
lot
more
of
it
throughout
my
life
a
very
tasty
but
not
overwhelming
gueuze
great
for
people
who
are
trying
to
get
into
this
style
o
a
very
nice
gueuze
i
got
to
try
for
more
than
half
off
at
the
bulls
head
i
dont
drink
enough
belgian
beer
o
i
really
like
this
one
i
just
think
it
was
still
a
bit
too
young
i
enjoyed
how
fruity
it
tasted
but
i
prefer
my
gueuze
to
be
a
bit
funkier
still
a
great
beer
none
the
less
o
easily
the
best
geuze
that
ive
had
everything
blends
nicely
and
nothing
takes
from
the
other
truly
amazing
fantastic
o
delicious
gueuze
im
glad
i
was
able
to
find
this
at
a
local
store
and
pick
it
up
great
combination
of
tart
sour
and
funk
with
just
a
hint
of
sweetness
would
like
to
have
again
pours
a
hazy
orangeish
color
with
an
off
white
head
in
the
aroma
sour
yeasty
and
somewhat
fruity
in
the
taste
sour
and
tart
with
a
small
sweet
fruitiness
that
lingers
all
the
way
through
a
sour
bite
and
lighter
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
sweet
tart
like
aftertaste
sweet
and
sour
light
body
quite
fantastic
poured
from
a
375
ml
bottle
dated
nov
18
2010
into
my
stone
irs
tulip
got
about
of
finger
and
a
half
of
champagneesque
head
that
dies
quickly
but
the
everpresent
bubbles
remain
golden
hued
body
tart
fruit
on
the
nose
especially
apple
granny
smith
in
the
house
funky
but
not
full
on
barnyard
probably
drinking
it
a
little
young
maybe
some
sour
feet
on
the
nose
too
the
hairs
in
my
nose
prickle
im
in
love
more
of
that
tart
unripe
granny
smith
apple
stuff
going
on
on
the
palate
a
funky
bitter
hop
finish
along
with
some
citrus
peel
bitterness
very
dry
and
champagnelike
as
far
the
the
mouthfeel
goes
little
bubbles
very
little
bubbles
faneffingtastic
love
love
love
mouthfeeloverall
light
bodied
with
prickly
carbonation
pretty
good
here
overall
a
great
gueuze
very
sour
puckering
and
refreshing
had
this
directly
following
a
04
lou
pepe
gueuze
and
definitely
preferred
this
beer
o
really
nice
worth
it
if
you
are
looking
for
the
reald
deal
and
style
not
many
can
do
it
better
than
this
o
this
was
good
but
not
as
good
as
the
gueuze
tilquin
balanced
but
not
as
tasty
i
was
very
surprised
by
the
carbonation
thing
and
wanted
a
bit
bigger
flavor
o
nice
and
refreshing
highly
drinkable
enjoyed
this
one
very
much
overall
this
is
just
a
splendid
gueuze
with
the
flashes
of
flavor
and
elegant
complexity
this
is
a
beer
i
could
enjoy
over
and
over
this
is
an
excellent
geuze
o
to
be
honest
i
was
a
bit
disappointed
by
this
given
all
the
hype
around
this
brewer
its
good
dont
get
me
wrong
but
just
nowhere
near
as
refreshing
as
others
namely
boons
two
oude
geuze
varieties
at
this
price
point
i
would
much
rather
have
the
boon
oude
geuze
mariage
parfait
o
a
i
really
like
this
one
but
maybe
i
just
like
a
little
more
fruit
backing
to
the
tartness
delicious
work
though
this
is
the
gueuze
that
every
other
offering
in
the
style
should
be
measured
against
very
complex
funky
and
amply
tart
in
the
taste
and
smell
with
a
classic
gueuze
mouthfeel
incredibly
ageable
lacks
a
touch
in
the
appearance
though
m
great
very
drinkable
easy
on
the
tongue
but
has
subdued
gueuze
finish
very
mellow
allaround
about
like
sipping
a
champagne
with
the
flavor
of
a
white
wine
and
the
body
of
a
beer
just
good
allround
pours
a
pale
golden
color
with
a
decent
size
foam
that
dies
down
quickly
but
does
provide
some
belgian
lace
aroma
is
openly
sour
white
wine
vinegar
and
pleasant
barnyard
funkyness
in
the
taste
sour
very
nice
lactic
brett
notes
playing
out
well
into
the
aftertaste
nice
sour
character
and
a
small
presence
of
oak
mouthfeel
is
lighter
bodied
and
effervescent
overall
a
fine
geueze
and
worth
seeking
out
i
would
say
this
is
up
there
with
the
best
ive
tried
i
am
looking
to
revisit
this
baby
with
some
time
in
my
cellar
minimal
sediment
in
the
2009
was
staying
at
one
corner
of
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
the
2004
had
a
significant
amount
of
loose
sediment
that
made
it
into
the
glass
didnt
have
a
proper
pitcher
to
filter
it
out
but
i
did
end
up
drinking
the
warm
dregs
like
a
hounding
hobo
kitten
lickin
at
an
emptystinky
cream
dish
acrosst
kitchen
floor
overall
an
indulgent
experience
the
airy
and
prickly
bubbles
make
for
an
excellent
rooftop
drink
on
a
cool
summer
night
a
wonderful
gueuze
o
one
of
my
favorite
guezes
im
reviewing
a
fairly
fresh
bottle
here
and
i
know
that
every
batch
is
unique
in
some
ways
but
ive
vintages
going
back
to
2004
that
were
just
phenomenal
this
is
one
for
the
records
a
super
awesome
beer
one
of
the
most
complex
and
balanced
gueuze
ive
ever
had
overall
an
amazing
beer
the
most
balanced
gueuze
that
i
ever
experienced
barnyard
and
sour
flavors
play
off
each
other
complementing
each
other
throughout
the
entire
palate
a
very
awesome
experience
overall
complex
and
playful
i
would
drink
this
over
nearly
any
gueuze
out
there
the
more
i
drink
it
the
more
i
appreciate
its
quality
o
i
think
this
would
be
a
great
early
stage
brew
when
turning
newbie
craft
beer
peeps
onto
sours
not
too
sour
just
delicious
o
one
of
the
premier
belgian
guezes
and
an
excellent
example
of
the
fine
art
of
blending
aged
lambics
so
good
4
5
o
quite
a
delicious
geuze
one
of
the
best
i
have
had
do
drinkability
is
high
probably
the
most
quaffable
gueuze
ive
had
by
far
each
and
every
sip
of
this
was
a
joy
and
the
funk
definitely
did
not
overshadow
any
of
the
subtle
complexities
of
the
aged
lambic
after
sipping
from
the
glass
that
had
the
beginning
and
end
of
the
bottle
its
easily
much
different
than
what
i
had
in
my
drinking
glass
which
i
guess
does
lend
itself
to
the
belief
that
it
should
be
consumed
separately
or
not
at
all
according
to
some
brewers
but
i
wont
go
that
far
this
separate
glass
was
a
bit
more
bitter
didnt
have
as
much
fruit
zest
in
it
and
was
a
bit
more
heavier
o
really
great
example
of
the
style
fairly
available
as
well
great
combo
ive
resisted
buying
most
3f
beers
due
to
price
but
bit
the
bullet
on
this
small
375ml
bottle
definitely
glad
i
did
no
disappointment
at
all
id
put
this
in
my
top
3
gueuzes
overall
love
great
beer
that
is
pretty
easily
obtainable
cant
believe
i
aint
ticked
this
yet
oh
well
looks
like
ill
be
filling
a
big
hole
here
thats
what
she
said
375ml
bottle
vintage
2009
from
kl
redwood
city
the
beer
pours
hazy
golden
color
with
a
onefinger
white
head
and
good
lacing
the
aroma
is
very
funky
more
funky
than
sour
which
i
like
barnyard
and
sweet
maltiness
the
flavor
has
a
very
slight
sweetness
to
it
as
well
as
a
medium
level
of
sourness
pale
malt
and
funk
oak
and
earth
im
not
going
to
go
into
the
delicious
yet
disgusting
farm
descriptors
but
they
worked
well
nice
palate
lively
yet
not
overly
acidic
with
medium
body
rather
refreshing
when
cold
a
damn
solid
gueuze
overall
o
a
very
good
lighterdrier
sour
not
a
beer
to
power
through
due
to
the
explosion
of
fizz
with
each
sip
good
but
not
the
best
sour
ive
ever
had
the
best
sour
ive
had
weve
been
putting
this
one
off
for
a
while
after
our
first
attempt
at
drinking
a
geuze
a
year
ago
or
so
while
my
taste
buds
have
clearly
matured
to
the
point
that
i
can
appreciate
this
more
than
my
last
taste
of
this
style
i
still
find
it
to
be
a
little
too
funky
and
sour
for
my
tastes
my
wife
however
has
absolutely
no
use
for
this
beer
give
her
a
sweet
lambic
and
shes
fine
but
forget
this
sour
stuff
still
it
seems
to
be
a
wellbrewed
beer
one
which
withstood
a
couple
years
in
our
cellar
just
fine
maybe
ill
give
this
style
another
year
or
so
and
try
again
t
i
was
a
little
spooked
by
the
smell
but
the
taste
isnt
bad
lots
of
tartness
with
some
apple
cider
vinegar
a
good
dose
of
funk
and
a
bit
of
musty
wood
o
what
a
great
beer
perfect
for
a
summer
night
and
paired
wonderfully
with
my
leftover
hummus
from
the
stone
brewery
trip
only
a
few
hours
before
the
beer
is
worth
every
penny
overall
refreshing
d
this
was
a
very
nice
gueuze
the
scent
and
body
were
spot
on
and
the
taste
was
very
nice
too
it
wasnt
overpowering
but
there
was
still
lots
of
wild
funk
and
tartness
so
it
was
easy
to
drink
but
worth
sipping
age
forever
for
enjoy
fresh
definitely
recommended
mouthfeel
and
taste
tingley
ample
carbonation
and
a
medium
body
highlight
the
musty
sourness
it
is
tart
but
not
sharp
the
sourness
is
smooth
with
lemon
rind
flavours
chalk
and
overripe
fruit
it
is
quite
vinous
with
a
tannic
bitter
sour
grapefruit
finish
overall
pretty
enjoyable
and
certainly
not
over
the
top
nice
for
something
different
i
really
liked
this
beer
i
paired
it
with
some
habanero
pepperjack
cheese
and
it
was
outstanding
i
think
i
have
enjoyed
this
more
than
i
enjoyed
the
two
cantillon
offerings
ive
had
to
this
point
iris
classic
geuze
very
glad
im
finding
a
liking
to
this
style
overall
i
have
reviewed
this
cantillon
and
girardin
all
to
the
exact
same
score
subtle
differences
amongst
all
three
but
they
are
all
excellent
in
their
own
right
you
cant
go
wrong
with
either
of
them
i
much
preferred
this
one
to
cantillons
gueuze
as
i
felt
the
flavor
profile
was
much
more
diverse
and
intense
the
traditional
elements
are
all
here
and
seem
carefully
blended
a
truly
outstanding
gueuze
in
its
own
right
overall
as
many
have
said
this
style
is
not
for
everyone
but
if
you
like
sours
as
i
do
it
is
a
superb
example
and
one
i
would
highly
recommend
overall
i
thought
this
beer
was
very
refreshing
a
good
amount
of
sourness
the
lemon
notes
were
very
welcome
i
would
have
this
one
again
an
excellent
geuze
i
would
probably
like
it
even
more
with
age
but
not
even
a
year
in
the
bottle
and
theres
tons
of
complexity
warning
i
almost
died
when
i
unfastened
the
metal
the
cork
shoot
to
the
ceiling
and
when
returning
just
missed
me
many
champagne
wines
would
be
jalous
about
this
force
medium
body
nice
carbonation
level
dry
and
lasting
on
the
tongue
wraps
around
and
holds
tight
pretty
much
an
ideal
relatively
easy
to
find
gueuze
although
ill
give
the
edge
to
cantillon
classic
overall
an
outstanding
gueuze
for
its
availability
something
i
try
to
turn
people
onto
whenever
possible
sharp
citric
notes
with
plenty
of
funk
endlessly
complex
and
subtle
truly
world
class
and
something
every
beer
drinker
should
try
atleast
once
in
their
lives
o
a
solid
offering
although
it
is
less
funky
than
i
would
have
imagined
d
this
is
a
really
solid
gueze
one
of
the
best
i
have
had
the
pleasure
of
trying
as
stated
many
times
above
very
sour
and
yet
very
delicious
good
thing
i
have
3
more
of
these
sitting
in
the
cellar
o
gueuzes
are
ever
growing
on
me
this
is
a
little
bit
less
funky
than
the
others
ive
had
and
think
it
be
a
good
starter
mouthfeel
is
perfectly
crisp
leaving
a
nice
brisk
dryness
to
the
cheeks
and
tongue
great
amount
of
tiny
bubbling
overall
in
the
mouth
definitely
champagneesque
incredible
beereven
if
it
is
one
of
the
few
types
of
gueuzes
ive
ever
had
armand
is
a
genius
o
great
beer
can
drink
this
all
the
time
and
will
when
i
get
the
chance
d
good
drink
easy
sour
flavor
really
feels
and
taste
great
on
the
tongue
probably
one
of
the
better
gueuze
drinks
out
there
fantastic
aftermeal
drink
o
delicious
tart
and
beautiful
id
love
to
grab
a
few
more
bottles
and
see
how
they
age
o
quite
an
enjoyable
lambic
pick
it
up
if
you
can
the
only
problem
is
that
once
you
have
tasted
it
it
might
be
difficult
to
age
a
second
bottle
i
love
the
fact
that
you
can
drink
a
lot
of
this
thanks
to
the
low
abv
o
this
is
a
fantastic
geuze
blended
from
3
years
of
lambic
a
fantastic
representation
of
this
style
this
would
be
a
great
segway
beer
into
this
style
o
a
geueze
is
geueze
i
still
havnt
had
a
bad
one
this
one
is
no
exception
d
good
drinkability
and
just
awesome
beer
overall
o
very
good
brew
i
still
find
gueuzes
a
bit
on
the
intense
side
but
i
have
been
moving
close
to
enjoying
them
more
the
beer
does
have
a
nice
sweet
sugary
middle
to
it
almost
like
a
green
apple
cheers
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
very
pleasing
brew
that
boasts
quite
a
bit
of
salivation
factor
to
it
as
more
sips
are
taken
it
gets
increasingly
drying
on
the
tongue
which
makes
this
brew
nearly
poundable
the
6
alcohol
hits
home
with
a
warmth
that
is
expected
and
well
integrated
every
once
in
awhile
i
get
a
thrist
that
only
a
geuze
can
quence
and
this
was
a
plesant
treat
overall
good
tasting
refreshing
beer
the
sour
integrate
well
with
the
flavor
profile
i
would
have
preferred
a
bit
more
carbonation
but
i
can
live
with
it
as
is
i
will
buy
this
one
again
the
best
geuze
ive
ever
had

the
1999
vintage
of
this
beer
while
i
didnt
take
detailed
notes
i
just
want
to
point
out
that
it
was
right
up
there
with
lente
for
the
best
geuze
ive
ever
had
in
my
life
it
was
almost
tragically
close
to
perfection
and
since
i
drank
it
at
bier
circus
i
dont
have
to
worry
about
the
romance
of
the
brewery
setting
having
possibly
clouded
my
judgement
ill
keep
hunting
down
new
vintages
of
this
beer
but
i
really
cant
imagine
that
any
of
them
will
come
close
to
the
99
heres
hoping
my
imagination
is
just
a
little
bit
too
limited
o
refreshing
tart
but
highly
drinkable
definitely
a
little
too
pricy
to
drink
casually
but
worth
trying
o
im
disappointed
that
the
brettanomyces
isnt
a
bit
more
pronounced
with
that
said
i
love
this
beer
and
knew
coming
in
that
it
would
rate
well
highly
recommended
o
this
is
one
fine
gueuze
bit
steep
price
wise
but
definitely
worth
it
in
my
opinion
fuller
bodied
than
the
98
and
a
bit
more
funky
with
an
earthy
musty
character
and
subtle
acidity
that
lingers
into
a
sweet
puckering
vinegary
finish
well
balanced
and
complex
remaining
mouthpuckering
and
sour
without
and
harshness
or
acidic
burn
soft
and
clean
with
a
chewier
mouthfeel
lots
of
citrus
flavor
especially
lemon
peel
excellent
o
a
refreshing
drink
with
some
great
characteristics
and
some
unusual
notes
sadly
the
taste
fails
to
deliver
in
a
way
that
could
keep
me
interested
and
intrigue
me
into
picking
this
up
again
should
the
flavor
move
out
from
its
shy
hiding
one
day
id
love
to
have
this
again
o
this
is
a
magical
fairy
tale
beer
of
awesome
its
part
rumplestiltskin
gold
and
part
snow
white
apple
and
it
turned
me
into
a
newt
the
sour
is
nice
and
tart
like
i
enjoy
without
tasting
like
bile
and
the
sour
apple
taste
is
really
refreshing

no
better
gueuze
available
in
the
us
taste
is
just
as
crazy
lots
of
super
tart
funkiness
theres
some
dandilion
and
citrus
as
well
mouthfeel
is
light
super
dry
and
well
carbonated
awesome
beer
notes
really
impressed
with
this
brew
would
love
to
see
it
with
a
few
years
on
it
but
its
wonderfully
refreshing
right
now
refreshing
and
good
with
mature
cheddar
a
rather
small
body
maybe
sampled
too
young
light
to
medium
bodied
well
carbonated
finishes
dry
and
tart
a
very
nice
gueuze
which
is
a
style
i
am
liking
more
and
more
all
the
time
update
after
having
this
numerous
times
now
i
am
bumping
its
score
up
from
what
i
originally
had
overall
i
think
this
absolutely
top
notch
and
could
see
myself
drinking
it
everyday
if
i
could
drink
i
think
one
is
enough
for
me
working
my
way
to
appreciating
the
outer
styles
is
hard
on
the
palate
pours
a
very
murky
golden
little
bit
of
orange
color
with
a
medium
white
head
scent
is
extremely
funky
with
a
lot
of
barnyard
and
some
horse
blanket
i
also
get
a
lot
of
lemon
and
funky
cheese
i
now
truly
know
what
its
like
to
have
cheese
as
a
descriptive
term
for
beer
taste
is
exactly
like
it
smells
and
very
delicious
you
get
the
funky
cheese
flavors
blended
well
with
the
lemonvinegar
flavors
and
subtle
horse
blanket
the
lemony
and
barnyard
notes
make
this
one
unforgettable
gueuze
mouthfeel
is
very
fullbodied
with
a
mouthpuckering
dry
finish
drinkability
is
very
high
this
is
one
amazing
beer
overall
a
very
enjoyable
geuze
i
love
drie
fonteinens
beers
i
think
the
vinegaryness
was
a
little
more
than
i
like
in
a
geuze
tastewise
but
otherwise
it
was
very
well
made
and
super
complex
i
feel
like
i
am
finally
beginning
to
be
able
to
appreciate
sours
a
little
more
and
taste
whats
underneath
all
that
well
sourness
overall
one
of
the
best
geuzes
out
there
get
it
if
you
want
a
perfect
example
of
what
it
is
suppose
to
be
like
medium
to
mediumlight
bodied
creamy
in
the
mouth
at
first
but
with
a
good
bit
of
carbonation
midpalate
dry
and
lightly
tannic
finish
implores
you
on
honestly
if
i
lived
in
belgium
this
would
be
my
daily
drink
after
a
long
day
d
ive
been
waiting
a
long
while
to
try
this
and
finally
opened
my
bottle
and
it
lived
up
to
every
hype
ive
heard
about
it
i
have
one
more
on
hand
and
am
planning
on
running
to
the
store
after
i
dig
out
of
this
snowstorm
to
pick
up
whatever
else
they
have
on
the
shelf
delicious
really
really
drinkable
im
loving
this
i
cant
wait
to
try
this
with
some
age
on
it
once
again
my
old
reviews
blow
not
that
the
newer
ones
are
much
better
basically
the
1999
vintage
was
a
special
year
for
this
geuze
ive
had
it
since
and
its
very
good
though
possibly
a
tad
overrated
by
some
even
at
a
couple
years
this
geuze
is
wondrous
it
destroyed
a
bunch
of
really
highly
regarded
american
sours
at
a
small
tasting
recently
just
such
full
expressive
funk

barley

unmalted
wheat
pours
a
clear
toasted
amber
hue
quite
effervescent
with
a
huge
crackly
head
that
nearly
escapes
the
glass
it
settles
to
a
clingy
half
inch
that
doesnt
quite
grab
on
to
the
glass
strongly
enough
to
deposit
any
lace
its
surprisingly
mild
aroma
contributes
lemons
malt
and
a
dash
of
funk
prominent
acids
and
esters
on
the
palate
with
a
lactic
acid
twang
cherry
lemons
earth
and
an
oak
presence
the
body
is
nearly
full
at
times
with
loads
of
carbonation
an
oaky
dryness
and
a
sour
finish
this
one
seems
to
focus
more
on
the
sourness
than
the
funk
but
it
is
wellbalanced
and
very
easy
to
drink
db
cheek
puckering
sour
gueuze
with
a
lot
of
funk
more
straight
forward
than
the
other
two
will
probably
have
it
again
in
the
future
or
try
vintages
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
but
probably
could
not
have
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
i
hope
to
try
more
geuzes
in
the
near
future
to
see
how
they
compare
to
this
one
out
of
the
gueuzes
we
tried
this
was
easily
the
palate
killer
i
enjoyed
the
abrasiveness
but
it
seemed
a
little
onenote
for
me
no
specific
flavors
stood
out
except
for
pure
sour
funk
not
as
sour
as
some
of
the
other
gueuzes
that
ive
tried
but
better
balance
of
flavors
that
may
have
been
the
brewers
goal
with
the
blend
a
nice
gueuze
to
introduce
to
someone
new
to
the
style
as
the
tartness
is
brief
and
not
lingering
d
a
very
nice
gueuze
with
a
great
tartsour
smell
to
it
would
love
to
have
again

wow
this
beer
is
even
more

than
i
expected

to
be
the
taste

i
think
this
is
a
good
overall
brew
id
definitely
buy
this
again
in
the
future
geuzes
are
unique
this
one
is
a
tad
bitter
for
a
geuze
the

bitterness

last
with
the
sourness
up

gueuzes
dont
get
much
more

experiance

lots
of
lemon
barnyard

funk
and
a
small
amount
of
sour
on

this
gueuze
has
a
great
flavor
of
lemon
straw
wheat
barnyard
funk
these
are
predominanat
than
a
wave
of
sour
acidicness
more
of
the
funk
than
sour
mouthfeel
is
as
it
should
be
the
only
thing
is
i
detect
a
faint
acrid
flavor
on
the
finish
the
caveat
is
that
i
am
congested
so
ill
rereview

feeling
better

a

i
could

this

served
from
bottle
into
a
goblet
poured
a
hazy
yellow
orange
with
a
half
finger
pure
white
head
that
subsided
to
none
very
quickly
there
was
no
lacing
evident
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
tart
slight
sour
and
decent
funk
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
tart
sour
and
funk
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
high
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
nice
brew
definitely
a
lot
of
funk
going
on
in
this
one
it
actually
overpowered
my
buddys
palate
some
with
all
of
the
funk
but
i
found
it
to
be
balanced
with
a
slight
edge
given
to
the
funk
definitely
a
good
aroma
going
on
here
wish
this
one
had
a
little
more
age
on
it
so
allow
it
to
develop
this
is
a
must
try
for
any
fan
of
the
style
without
a
doubt
though
i
poured
my
bottle
into
a
snifter
that
was
too
small
there
was
incredible
carbonation
with
a
huge
head
smelled
very
delicious
rotting
wood
musty
attics
sour
infections
this
tastes
delicious
as
with
all
gueuze
but
is
a
little
sweet
i
was
expecting
a
greater
sour
punch
from
this
but
i
feel
like
it
would
need
a
little
more
time
to
balance
out
would
i
seek
this
out
again
definitely
corked
and
caged
375ml
poured
into
my
boulevard
smokestack
goblet
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
bruised
orange
with
a
massive
3
inch
cap
that
leaves
sticky
lacing
down
the
sides
of
the
glass
a
good
12
inch
head
sticks
around
the
the
entirety
of
the
pour
the
aroma
is
fantastic
at
first
whiff
fresh
oak
comes
through
with
citric
fruit
tanginess
and
just
a
bit
of
barnyard
funk
surprisingly
just
a
hint
of
vanilla
comes
through
at
the
very
tail
of
the
nose
i
can
only
imagine
it
comes
from
the
oak
the
flavor
is
very
balanced
citric
tartness
hits
the
back
of
the
jaw
reminding
me
of
fresh
grapefruit
mixed
with
pineapple
sweetness
musty
barnyard
combined
with
fresh
oak
the
mouthfeel
is
much
creamier
then
most
gueuzes
but
it
finishes
dryly
like
any
good
gueuze
drie
fonteinen
oude
geuze
is
quite
a
bit
different
then
most
gueuzes
ive
had
while
different
its
still
extremely
tasty
got
this
one
from
andy
for
christmas
12
7
ounce
bottle
bottled
on
december
10th
2009
and
poured
into
a
tulip
the
body
is
a
hazy
straw
color
with
surprisingly
big
white
fluffy
head
not
the
most
complex
aroma
in
the
world
on
this
one
but
its
exactly
what
it
needs
to
be
simply
sour
with
woody
notes
fantastic
the
taste
follows
the
aroma
nicely
tart
and
sour
through
and
through
with
a
woody
finish
and
sour
white
grape
taste
near
perfect
mouthfeel
i
think
with
the
style
id
like
a
bit
less
carbonation
but
otherwise
wonderful
recommended
as
a
sipper

a
very
nice
gueze

is

am

and

may
well
turn
into

around
my

merry
christmas
sour
and
refreshing
nice
funky
beer
d
like
other
sours
i
am
have
had
i
would
not
like
to
drink
a
lot
at
once
but
it
is
easy
to
drink
and
enjoy
a
bottle
i
really
like
this
beer
but
feel
it
could
be
a
little
better
if
it
was
a
little
more
sour
and
a
little
less
funky
2004
bottle
pours
blond
with
a
big
fat
head
with
big
fat
bubbles
the
aroma
is
outstanding
lemony
peppery
funky
with
good
floral
and
bubblegum
notes
that
i
have
never
seen
in
a
gueuze
i
also
love
that
everpresent
horse
blanket
aroma
lingering
in
the
background
the
flavor
is
earthy
with
some
lemon
rind
some
nice
but
mild
sourness
dry
white
oaky
notes
plenty
funky
but
not
over
the
top
insanely
drinkable
truly
a
delightful
brew
i
dont
know
ive
had
some
tasty
gueuzes
and
some
ones
that
had
such
a
mellow
and
refined
complexity
to
them
to
be
honest
i
feel
this
missed
the
mark
a
little
bit
theres
no
doubting
the
skill
that
went
into
it
but
ive
certainly
had
better
side
by
side
the
doesjel
is
woodier
less
grassy
less
bright
citrus
less
sweetfloral
character
both
are
excellent
beers
but
i
have
to
tip
my
hat
to
the
oude
gueuze
its
an
exceptionally
crafted
beer
fantastic
gueuze
the
smell
may
have
been
the
best
ive
experience
to
date
the
taste
is
sublimely
smooth
complex
and
balanced
and
it
finishes
nice
and
dry
grabbed
a
375
of
this
tonight
at
redstone
pours
out
a
hazy
golden
color
with
just
a
small
amount
of
white
lacing
dry
champagne
comes
in
first
followed
by
some
sharp
citrus
hay
and
funk
pithy
tartness
hits
you
immediately
upon
tasting
with
the
above
mentioned
flavors
gaining
even
more
complexity
as
the
beer
warms
body
is
light
spritzy
and
well
carbonated
drinkability
is
lovely
it
is
actually
kind
of
sad
when
the
experience
ends
this
paired
remarkably
well
with
a
hunk
of
jarlsberg
cheese
beers
like
this
remind
me
why
i
love
gueuze
so
much
i
enjoyed
the
drie
fonteinen
gueuze
very
much
i
am
no
expert
but
i
found
the
other
classic
examples
of
the
style
girardin
hanssens
etc
smoother
than
this
particular

i
gather
most
reviewers
age
this
beer
i
may
get
another
one
at
some
future
point
and
cellar
it
for
a
few
years
uncorked
a
bottle
labeled
april
2003
cellared
since
it
came
into
my
hands
as
a
gift
34
years
ago
and
portioned
into
water
tumblers
a
decent
approximation
of
a
standard
lambic
glass
actually
tightbubbled
head
abounded
a
bit
less
frothy
than
memories
of
younger
bottles
less
lees
than
expected
the
color
gave
another
hint
of
its
age
with
a
touch
more
dark
copper
glinting
through
the
hay
hue
of
a
younger
version
the
nose
was
surprisingly
less
lambicfunky
with
a
cleaner
citrus
zest
and
grass
aroma
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
remain
foremost
highly
acidic
the
tang
is
turned
down
slightly
from
a
fresher
version
the
flavors
jumping
out
at
me
were
of
peach
and
other
yellow
fruits
with
a
cleansing
herby
note
that
felt
more
than
tasted
of
coriander
im
surprised
to
say
that
i
wish
almost
that
id
given
it
a
couple
more
years
to
see
if
it
would
mellow
out
further
you
can
see
the
theme
all
through
this
that
it
didnt
evolve
as
much
as
i
expected
and
had
further
to
go
with
drie
fonteinen
switching
from
blender
to
brewer
its
all
the
more
important
to
maintain
and
preserve
those
old
bottles
and
yes
to
drink
them
not
archive
them
love
this
beer
always
a
treat
and
highly
recommended
slightly
hazy
golden
pour
with
a
big
frothy
white
head
the
aroma
is
oaky
white
grapes
with
notes
of
black
pepper
bright
citrus
honey
grass
and
brett
sour
white
grape
flavor
with
hints
of
lemon
pepper
wheat
and
oak
medium
body
with
lots
of
effervescent
carbonation
and
a
dry
tart
finish
overall
a
very
drinkable
gueze
with
a
crisp
refreshing
tartness
nice
carbonation
and
a
pleasant
mouthfeel
drinkability
im
not
too
familiar
with
gueuzes
so
my
review
might
not
be
that
helpful
this
resembled
a
spiked
imperial
saison
in
my
opinion
though
very
complex
funky
and
interesting
not
that
smooth
but
enjoyable
worth
a
try
drinkability
im
taking
this
slow
but
will
have
not
a
problem
finishing
it
up
very
enjoyable
and
refreshing
would
pick
this
up
again
if
i
had
the
chance
t
like
expected
very
sour
unripe
apples
grape
seeds
white
wine
some
citrus
an
orange
sherbet
note
insane
complexity
here
but
still
very
drinkable
after
the
initial
shock
it
starts
opening
up
and
you
get
a
pleasant
appley
finish
amidst
a
slightly
musty
character
sour
sugar
is
in
the
aftertaste
like
the
feeling
you
get
after
eating
a
sour
candy
im
not
sure
i
can
recommend
this
highly
enough
but
in
any
case
it
probably
doesnt
matter
as
1997
is
pretty
old
and
im
sure
becoming
rare
but
later
vintages
will
likely
be
nice
too
i
brought
a
2002
home
with
me
from
belgium
also
a
2006
for
a
friend
maybe
well
try
them
both
sidebyside
together
sour
all
around
with
good
hop
bitterness
to
finish
oak
and
lemon
zest
touch
of
estery
sweetness
id
say
more
complex
than
your
average
gueze
lovely
overall
it
shows
age
but
it
is
still
a
decent
beer
i
am
really
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
among
the
cream
of
the
crop
when
talking
gueuze
this
deserves
its
high
rating

thick

of

are
present
during
the
tasting

exhibit
excellent

nose

extremely
lively
almost
prickly
acidity
stimulates
the
salivary

and
finish
is
extremely
dry

palatecleansing
a
solid
gueuze
but
perhaps
still
a
little
young
the
correct
elements
are
there
but
not
much
complexity
at
this
point
drie
fonteinen
oude
gueuze
is
subtle
complex
and
a
hell
of
a
beer
the
price
tag
is
high
but
the
quality
is
also
pretty
excellent
definitely
a
sipper
d
highly
drinkable
it
is
a
shame
that
brouwerij
drie
fonteinen
is
now
defunct
due
to
their
catastrophe
i
do
not
use
that
word
lightly
but
it
is
since
this
will
no
longer
be
available
need
to
stock
up
asap
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
drinkability
is
very
good
it
has
some
great
sour
and
funky
flavors
the
acidicness
was
kept
in
moderation
which
really
helped
the
drinkability
for
me
overall
an
excellent
beer
and
an
excellent
version
of
the
style
o
the
only
thing
standing
in
the
way
of
this
being
an
every
day
beer
for
me
is
the
price
10
for
a
375ml
is
a
bit
high
although
it
is
an
import
i
wish
theyd
make
something
like
this
in
the
us
d
a
very
good
lambic
beer
well
made
at
11
a
bottle
id
rather
have
boon
or
cantillon
at
a
lesser
price
point
nevertheless
great
beer
an
excellent
gueuze
puckering
and
tasty
the
pour
is
golden
with
a
very
mild
cloudy
and
a
white
head
of
about
a
finger
nose
is
out
of
this
world
as
for
a
quality
of
sour
there
is
tart
a
leathery
sour
that
is
on
the
brink
of
unnatural
in
the
beer
world
smoke
of
burnt
coriander
rosemary
and
burnt
rubber
wild
ash
to
the
point
that
it
smelled
like
an
ashtray
palate
was
astringent
like
grass
tart
but
woody
oak
and
leathery
astringent
like
blue
cheese
and
malt
character
of
mild
sweet
pollen
lily
floral
and
a
bitter
that
is
ash
and
turbid
sesame
oil
a
new
look
at
lambics
after
this
one
a
most
overall
a
really
good
example
of
the
style
nothing
jumped
out
at
me
as
particularly
exciting
but
everything
about
it
was
solid
update

will
leave
the
original
review
but
must
say
that
over
the
years
this
has
become
one
of
my
absolute
favorite
beers
and
its
a
huge
bonus
that
its
fairly
readily
available
the
funk
with
slight
sourness
comes
from
what
is
as
far
as
im
concerned
the
best
blending
out
there
d
incredibly
sour
funky
pretty
lively
and
refreshing
one
of
the
better
beers
i
have
been
blessed
to
try
and
possibly
my
favorite
of
the
style
a
very
solid
drink
my
first
gueuzer
actually
i
love
sours
so
i
knew
id
be
a
fan
of
this
style
poured
a
slightly
hazy
light
amber
color
with
tall
white
foam
that
persisted
a
very
nice
geuze
aroma
with
mild
acid
and
wild
woody
notes
the
taste
was
sharp
and
mildly
acidic
lactic
and
acetic
with
woody
notes
and
faint
herbal
notes
very
nice
the
mouthfeel
was
dry
and
crisp
but
soft
for
a
geuze
medium
light
body
and
modest
carbonation
feel
the
flavors
linger
lightly
on
the
palate
this
was
an
excellent
bottle
of
geuze
d
nice
refreshing
fun
to
drink
d
as
said
above
it
reminds
me
of
the
homemade
wine
i
grew
up
sneaking
i
could
drink
this
forever
d
incredibly
drinkable
for
a
gueuze
the
tartness
is
strong
but
wellcontrolled
750

vintage
poured
into
a
small
snifter
hazy
golden
body
aroma
of
sour
apple
and
straight
up
funk
intensity
taste
is
somewhat
dry
and
funkadelic
soured
granny
smith
apple
dominates
wispy
and
quite
delicious
paired
beautifully
with
a
horshradish
white
cheddar
cheese
this
gueuze
has
a
very
hazy
yellow
appearance
there
is
a
small
white
fizzy
head
that
gradually
fades
leaving
no
lacing
aromas
consist
of
funky
straw
or
hay
lemons
subtle
wild
yeast
this
smells
like
a
traditional
gueuze
heavenly
the
flavor
is
wonderful
the
beer
has
a
healthy
amount
of
tartness
with
no
astringency
the
finish
is
acetic
but
not
so
much
so
that
i
wouldnt
consume
a
bottle
of
this
nectar
by
myself
its
always
a
treat
to
drink
this
great
beer
i
will
revisit
this
delicacy
as
long
as
armand
continues
brewing
it
d
this
beer
is
extremely
easy
to
drink
for
the
style
and
doesnt
have
any
funky
smells
or
sour
tastes
that
overpower
the
senses
d
very
crisp
not
too
sour
and
a
low
abv
if
you
like
funk
3
fonteinen
does
it
very
well
then
this
beer
is
a
must
have
d
this
is
a
middle
of
the
road
geuze
it
will
offend
the
the
uninitiated
but
is
a
good
geuze
and
worth
trying
bubbly
on
the
tongue
with
a
prickly
sour
finish
this
is
a
dry
beer
that
truly
reminded
me
of
champagne
i
finished
most
of
the
bottle
my
wife
didnt
care
for
it
as
much
as
i
but
our
450ml
bottle
was
enough
for
me
d
definitely
a
solid
representation
of
the
style
approachable
for
those
a
bit
more
bold
than
your
typical
light
lager
drinker
yet
complex
enough
to
interest
any
seasoned
beer
geek
bronze
color
and
a
nose
that
exudes
good
lambic
invigorating
on
the
palate
the
beer
is
quite
vinous
and
more
or
less
acidic
the
fruit
is
suggested
by
the
tannins
like
apricot
and
a
good
dose
of
oak
without
being
intrusive
gives
strength
and
sturdiness
to
the
body
we
taste
here
and
there
touches
of
white
wine
hints
bitter
perhaps
tannins
individuals
not
so
acid
are
felt
in
the
finish
and
endure
a
great
length
of
palate
that
allows
the
lambic
to
unfold
in
its
full
flavor
d
sweetness
makes
this
a
little
harder
to
put
down
and
a
little
trying
after
some
time
but
still
a
good
beer
for
my
first
gueuze
it
wasnt
bad
but
i
think
i
will
revisit
this
review
after
trying
a
couple
others
d
extremely
well
balanced
great
beer
and
one
that
i
could
easily
drink
several
bottles
of
in
one
sitting
drinks
i
may
not
know
from
gueuze
but
i
know
what
i
like
oude
gueuze
has
a
lot
of
flavor
packed
into
that
little
375ml
bottle
and
you
can
taste
the
effort
and
time
that
went
into
crafting
it
this
sixyearold
bottle
was
an
unexpected
surprise
and
a
rare
treat
clean
in
the
mouth
a
bit
drying
on
the
finish
light
and
refreshing
great
drinkability
i
love
this
style
but
i
think
the
lindemans
cuvee
rene
might
be
of
similar
quality
for
less
money
bright
citrus
intense
sour
balancedin
its
own
way
gueuze
isnt
for
everyone
but
for
those
twho
enjoy
it
this
is
top
shelf
stuff
the
cork
popped
off
of
this
one
with
no
effort
at
all
hazy
gold
hue
with
a
very
foamy
head
that
eventually
settles
down
to
a
small
tight
head
on
the
surface

juicy

attempting
to
counter
the
sour
gentle
despite
the
overall
sourness
very
smooth
and
floaty
with
moderate
carbonation
somewhat
puckering
leaving
the
inside
of
my
mouth
dry
i
like
it
a
dense
white
head
floats
on
top
of
this
slightly
hazy
golden
colored
gueuze
taste
and
aroma
achieves
perfection
never
had
i
had
a
more
balanced
experience
with
this
style
especially
with
a
vintage
this
old
the
brett
never
overpowers
the
acidity
and
theres
no
evidence
of
acetic
acid
there
are
bold
gueuze
characteristics
attacking
your
taste
buds
in
perfect
unity
it
finishes
clean
and
refreshingly
dry
age
has
been
very
kind

this
beer

are

the

and
a
long
sour

d
love
this
beer
cant
seem
to
put
it
down
glad
i
have
a
few
more
of
these
in
my
cellar
other
than
the
minor
issue
of
the
carbonation
a
great
beer
that
i
would
have
again
in
a
second
worth
noting
that
i
drank
this
over
about
90
minutes
from
cold
straight
from
the
fridge
to
nearly
room
temperature
the
flavor
profile
seemed
to
begin
to
shade
more
earthygrassy
as
it
warmed
and
was
very
pleasant
ive
heard
this
before
with
guezes
but
this
is
the
first
one
that
i
took
my
time
with
well
worth
it
d

lemon

sweet

some

like
i
said
awesome
everything
a
gueze
should
be
without
being
off
or
overwhelming
or
out
of
whack
very
nice
balance
here
in
the
taste
the
sour
funky
seems
to
be
rounded
out
and
contained
by
the
flavors
of
the
wood
pure
art
it
really
paints
a
picture
in
my
mind
of
fuzzy
dank
cellars
and
cool
belgian
countrysides
soft
as
velvet
and
spritzed
up
by
the
living
yeast
this
beer
not
only
speaks
to
me
it
makes
me
want
more
thank
you
drie
fontienen
sorry
to
hear
about
you
recent
problems
with
the
brewery
no
matter
what
happens
keep
em
coming
and
ill
keep
supporting
cheers
d
this
would
destroy
a
sour
noob
ive
enjoyed
it
though
and
would
pick
this
one
up
again
however
i
prefer
fruit
lambics
and
this
certainly
isnt
as
sour
as
cantillon
kriek
or
la
folie
really
a
solid
brew
however
my
only
problem
is
the
boatloads
of
carbonation
this
is
one
of
the
better
gueuzes
out
there
it
is
a
shock
at
first
but
mellows
oude
geuze
is
unlike
anything
ive
tried
thus
far
especially
in
terms
of
how
the
flavors
progressed
im
still
acclimating
myself
to
sours
but
i
really
like
how
the
dryness
works
in
conjunction
with
the
prominent
oak
characteristics
im
looking
forward
to
more
forays
into
the
style
pours
light
copper
with
a
vigorous
head
tropical
aromas
of
pineapple
kiwi
and
strawberry
with
hints
grassiness
and
a
slight
maltiness
flavor
has
a
clean
bright
sourness
with
some
astringency
well
carbonated
with
a
wet
feel
very
tasty
indeed
d
smooth
refined
yet
exhibiting
a
breadth
of
flavours
d
this
is
an
awsesome
beer
overall
and
pretty
much
what
i
think
of
when
i
think
of
a
great
classic
gueze
i
see
why
this
is
the
example
to
compare
the
rest
of
the
style
too
i
am
looking
forward
to
having
this
again
overall
superb
i
cant
wait
to
try
more
of
this
style
i
could
drink
this
everyday
overall
a
4
65
by
the
ba
system
d
though
it
is
tasty
and
not
particularly
flawed
i
think
this
is
not
as
good
as
many
of
the
widely
available
gueuzes
like
cantillon
classic
girardin
boon
hanssens
or
oud
beersel
d
havent
tried
many
beers
of
this
style
so
i
have
little
to
compare
to
but
i
really
enjoyed
this

lacing
scent
is
a
tremendously
big
yet
unaggreassive
whiff
of
musty
wood
leaves
and
damp
earth
like
a
walk
outside
after
a
day
of
rain
backed
by
nice
big
tart
and
sour
notes
that
awaken
the
senses
after
the
comforting
mustyness
taste
follws
scent
almost
to
the
t
dont
ask
me
how
i
know
what
earthy
wood
and
leaves
taste
like
but
this
is
it
the
tart
and
sourness
is
also
present
in
a
big
bold
way
but
somehow
compliments
the
earthyness
rather
than
covering
it
up
medium
in
body
perfect
carbonation
bone
dry
gone
before
it
hits
the
tongue
at
times
a
wonderful
beer
that
was
quite
the
experience
had
the
99
vintage
to
compare
with
the
50th
anniversary
and
the
blauw
flavors
were
slightly
muted
especially
compared
to
the
two
others
mentioned
much
less
funky
than
a
typically
oude
geuze
minerally
and
earthy
with
lighter
fruit
aspects
of
pear
peach
and
citrus
and
notes
of
dry
barrel
i
am
really
enjoying
this
on
a
hot
texas
evening
the
perfect
amount
of
acidic
sourness
dryness
and
refreshment
fairly
simple
but
highly
recommended
d
its
too
bad
these
guys
wont
be
brewing
anymore
but
im
glad
theyll
still
be
blending
and
giving
us
some
great
gueuzes
great
beer
wonderful
hazy
appearance
the
funk
goes
straight
through
the
nostrils
to
my
heart
a
deep
breathe
of
heaven
great
tasting
a
little
weak
in
the
funk
for
my
flavor
but
was
still
good
felt
great
simmering
on
my
tongue
for
a
second
before
the
gulp
wish
i
could
throw
back
a
halfdozen
but
i
could
probably
only
handle
23
and
definitely
couldnt
afford
too
many
more
than
that
d
a
must
have
for
any
lambic
lover
this
is
one
of
the
best
examples
i
have
come
across
unfortunately
a
limited
number
of
bottles
remain
hurry
up
and
snag
one
before
theyre
gone
of
the
gueuze
ive
tried
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
something
about
the
intensity
of
the
aroma
and
the
distinct
cheeselike
notes
sets
this
one
apart
for
me
j
notes
best
before
030318
nice
fruity
and
lightly
sweet
gueuze
mix
of
sour
and
sweet
but
the
sweet
is
subdued
a
lot
of
lemon
apple
grapefruit
and
other
fruit
well
balanced
and
complex
really
enjoyable
sour
that
is
worth
trying
right
on
the
border
of
world
class
this
was
a
good
gueuze
the
lemon
notes
really
made
this
enjoyable
i
plan
on
buying
more
d
love
gueuzes
but
again
wasnt
as
good
i
thought
it
would
be
decent
gueuze
though
i
couldnt
get
really
excited
about
the
taste
although
i
still
enjoyed
drinking
it
overall
a
truly
great
example
of
the
style
this
beer
has
all
the
elements
of
a
true
gueuze
and
is
exceptional
for
its
subtle
complexity
i
loved
this
beer
and
will
certainly
be
picking
up
more
of
it
notes
goes
well
with
chocolate
covered
strawberries
german
tilsit
cheese
and
guacamole
overall
an
outstanding
gueuze
definitely
recommended
very
drinkable
i
could
drink
this
all
day
long
terrific
example
of
the
style
overall
an
enjoyable
and
complex
beer
lots
of
sour
notes
and
funk
here
that
add
a
nice
richness
while
the
mouthfeel
keeps
it
light
and
refreshing
definitely
a
unique
refreshing
beer
notes
truly
a
palate
expanding
experience
drinkability
high
for
the
style
mouthfeel
is
champagne
like
nicely
carbonated
and
a
little
dry
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
very
deep
and
layered
yet
well
balanced
and
drinkable
definitely
a
blueprint
for
how
the
style
should
be
done
this
is
a
great
gueuze
not
as
tart
and
sour
as
cantillon
but
still
very
complex
would
definitely
have
again
overall
this
didnt
disappoinnt
it
wasnt
overpoweringly
tart
like
some
others
ive
had
yet
managed
to
be
absurdly
complex
well
worth
a
shot
while
its
still
available
light
body
very
tingly
feel
dry
finish
supremely
easy
drinker
outstanding
gueuze
with
a
lot
of
sour
beers
ive
had
in
the
past
i
thought
that
a
375ml
bottle
would
be
a
chore
to
finish
alone
but
a
750ml
of
drie
fonteinen
oude
gueuze
would
be
an
absolute
joy
drinkability
very
drinkable
this
is
good
but
not
a
standout
d
would
definitely
have
this
again
no
question
overall
this
is
a
very
well
done
gueuze
and
one
that
will
unfortunately
become
harder
to
come
by
brewery
is
shifting
to
a
full
time
distillery
i
hope
to
try
it
again
in
the
future
and
would
recommend
it
to
anyone
interested
in
the
style
a
puckering
mouthfeel
with
medium
body
while
funky
and
odd
this
beer
was
not
overly
so
rather
it
was
pretty
complex
and
an
interesting
experience
im
rather
new
to
lambics
and
brett
beers
but
this
was
a
good
primer
on
the
gueuze
style
for
me
id
like
to
pick
up
a
couple
more
of
these
to
put
in
the
cellar
and
see
what
happens
to
this
in
a
few
more
years
my
first
gueuze
and
boy
was
it
great
first
from
drie
fonteinen
beer
is
sour
up
front
with
a
slight
sulfur
that
shows
up
in
the
back
of
the
mouth
there
is
a
tartness
slight
in
the
corners
more
acetic
in
the
mouth
with
some
citric
less
lactic
now
beer
is
thin
and
finishes
pretty
cleanly
i
think
drinkability
is
high
and
mouthfeel
is
good
really
nice
developed
funk
in
the
aroma
cat
piss
and
sweaty
balls
acidic
tart
fruits
musty
bales
of
straw
and
granny
smith
apples
the
flavor
mirrors
this
with
a
moderately
puckering
bite
some
lemony
tartness
and
fruits
are
present
nice
spritzery
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
and
somewhat
chalky
finish
moderatehigh
carbonation
very
drinkable
and
the
perfect
serving
to
split
a
750ml
with
two
other
people
im
glad
i
cracked
this
because
now
i
can
go
back
to
the
store
and
buy
more
for
18
a
bottle
a
great
gueuze
d
goes
down
smooth
delicious
but
this
style
of
beer
in
general
i
find
challenging
with
overall
drinkability
this
is
one
of
the
better
ones
though
d
pretty
drinkable
not
too
palette
destroying
like
some
others
of
the
style
but
definitely
has
a
sour
kick
dont
know
if
id
drop
18
bucks
on
it
regularly
overall
i
am
impressed
with
this
its
solid
from
all
angles
and
maintains
the
sourness
without
being
offensive
ive
had
beers
that
were
more
sour
but
i
think
this
is
a
bit
of
control
in
a
bottle
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
really
great
sour
750ml
bottle
ive
got
a
real
relic
here
it
is
oude
geuze
1999
the
best
by
date
on
it
is
31122010
and
the
abv
is
6
5
i
traded
for
this
maybe
6
years
ago
and
it
has
been
hiding
in
the
back
of
the
fridge
since
then
it
opened
with
a
strong
pop
it
pours
an
orangishamber
color
there
was
a
small
head
on
it
but
it
dropped
away
rather
quickly
what
an
aroma
i
really
dont
know
where
to
start
on
this
one
bunches
of
sour
fruits
and
definitely
a
bit
funky
there
is
some
sourness
in
the
aroma
the
taste
is
superb
all
kinds
of
sour
fruits
in
here
that
have
blended
together
over
the
years
a
bit
of
spiciness
also
with
some
earthiness
in
the
background
kind
of
hard
to
explain
but
there
is
a
fullness
as
well
as
a
lightness
to
the
body
at
the
same
time
what
a
nice
treat
for
the
new
year
2003
vintage
pours
a
dirty
brownish
yellow
with
a
small
white
head
the
aroma
is
funky
with
lots
of
brett
resulting
in
a
horse
blanket
aroma
flavor
is
tart
and
funky
lots
of
lemons
and
some
wood
aging
characteristics
extremely
drinkable
light

3
fonteinen
didnt
disappoint
d
i
could
drink
sours
all
night
long
unlike
most
but
this
might
be
the
most
balanced
sour
ive
ever
had
ive
never
had
a
beer
that
has
all
elements
of
sours
funky
sour
with
a

more

in

much
more
dry
and

longer
finish
an
amazing
brew
bumps
taste
aroma
up
a
notch
give
this
one
to
you
wine
snob
friends
and
what
what
happens
drinkability
very
woody
for
an
old
beer
i
would
have
thought
that
this
flavor
would
have
dropped
out
by
now
a
superb
beer
cant
wait
to
see
what
its
like
in
another
ten
years
thanks
bo
overall
an
ultra
classic
and
fantastic
gueuze
certainly
one
im
glad
to
have
in
the
cellar
and
one
id
be
happy
to
drink
any
time
one
of
the
greats
d
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
is
subject
this
is
quite
a
beast
of
a
beer
that
only
experienced
beer
drinkers
should
try
but
if
your
palate
is
well
attuned
them
it
is
a
great
drink
drinkability
is
great
a
solid
gueuze
with
a
great
sharpness
and
a
funk
that
is
understated
but
dignified
not
for
those
getting
into
sours
but
a
very
drinkable
gueuze
for
sour
beer
lovers
cheers

from

thirst
quenching
perfect

for

time
not
overly

and
refreshing
more
than
super
sour
have
to
say
that
this
is
an
outstanding
gueuze
and
i
am
happy
that
is
readily
available
in
stores
around
me
will
be
drinking
this
again
recommended
it
would
be
a
damn
shame
if
3f
has
to
cease
production
over
a
faulty
thermostat
dry
and
intensely
sour
bitter
harsh
and
caressing
thin
and
full
lightly
fluffy
lingering
in
my
head
in
my
dreams
as
a
fierce
screech
rends
the
sky
the
black
wings
are
seen
wheeling
high
above
the
haze
they
swoop
down
again
they
can
smell
the
blood
i
shudder
as
i
hear
the
winds
tearing
through
their
thin
flaps
of
flesh
swooping
ever
closer
there
are
some
better
gueuzes
out
there
but
this
one
is
narrowly
behind
the
top
of
the
pack
a
complex
gueze
that
was
a
nice
treat
not
sure
id
get
this
again
as
it
was
a
bit
pricey
but
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
that
enjoys
beers
made
with
wild
yeast
or
even
those
interested
in
barrel
aged
beers
wanting
to
try
something
new
md
the
feel
on
this
gueuze
is
extremely
thin
with
not
a
lot
of
puckering
capability
some
carb
is
present
though
helping
things
out
the
drinkability
is
high
as
the
abv
is
low
as
is
the
sourness
of
this
beer
im
thinking
i
drank
this
to
young
it
can
easily
go
for
about
another
25
years
in
the
bottle
so
hopefully
it
will
funk
up
in
the
future
d
this
is
quite
a
nice
brew
even
though
it
is
only
6
abv
there
is
a
peppery
warmth
that
makes
it
a
easy
going
sipper
more
than
anything
good
stuff
and
recommended
di
love
this
beer
could
drink
this
everyday
overall
this
is
a
great
gueuze
its
not
overly
complex
but
is
solidly
drinkable
and
refreshing
while
deliving
some
awesome
sourness
no
offflavors
present
whatsoever
making
this
a
very
clean
and
enjoyable
sour
brew
m
medium
body
the
sour
makes
it
seam
more
carbonated
than
it
is
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
tulip
pours
a
fairly
bright
orange
with
an
active
white
head
this
puppy
is
carbonated
wonderful
musty
funky
aroma
if
musty
can
be
wonderful
very
strong
aroma
at
first
it
mellows
as
the
beer
sits
flavors
of
sour
apple
skins
sour
citrus
fruits
some
vinegar
but
it
ends
up
a
bit
sweet
and
dry
on
the
palate
tons
of
carbonation
makes
for
a
lively
mouthfeel
flavor
is
a
bit
cloying
staying
sharp
and
bitter
on
the
roof
of
my
mouth
wonderful
geuze
it
pours
up
a
murky
rust
color
with
a
big
frothy
off
white
head
the
nose
is
funky
musty
light
fruits
and
good
diarrhea
when
you
smell
it
youll
see
what
im
talking
about
the
taste
is
the
same
as
the
nose
super
sour
oaky
smooth
medium
bodied
medium
carbo
delicious
awesome
gueuze
thats
a
musttry
for
anyone
who
likes
sour
ales
crazy
complexity
that
my
description
just
cant
do
justice
overall
not
super
sour
or
tart
thin
to
mediumthin
mouthfeel
with
a
bit
of
effervesence
a
solid
gueze
in
any
book
good
stuff
and
quite
the
surprise
in
the
flavor
for
me
i
curve
this
one
high
shame
about
that
huge
take
being
damaged
at
their
brewery
by
a
faulty
thermometer
great
gueuze
drinkability
i
could
see
where
the
second
one
would
almost
seem
unnecessary
or
wasteful
but
i
love
i
would
love
to
sit
around
all
night
and
drink
yours
with
you
drinkability
if
u
love
this
style
u
can
drink
this
beer
all
night
very
little
carbonation
in
this
one
the
beer
is
a
rich
copper
color
with
a
very
faint
wispy
head
the
aroma
has
a
horse
and
barnyard
funk
mixed
with
some
sweet
apple
scents
not
a
sourbomb
but
a
slightly
sweetened
moderately
sour
funk
sweeted
after
the
fermentation
there
is
certainly
a
little
sweetness
in
the
front
of
the
brew
it
also
has
a
firm
bitterness
that
runs
throughout
refreshing
although
i
would
have
preferred
it
a
little
less
sweet
since
we
have
almost
no
sours
in
the
dallas
market
bobby
was
more
than
obliged
to
pop
this
one
open
and
one
of
my
first
experiences
drinking
a
true
sour
beer
was
a
great
one
i
loved
this
and
recommend
it
to
anyone
who
hasnt
had
a
sour
as
it
will
defy
conventions
as
to
what
you
know
as
beer
as
with
most
of
the
belgian
sours
ive
had
im
still
working
to
get
my
taste
buds
prepped
for
the
acidic
onslaught
that
inevitably
ensues
when
i
try
them
that
said
i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
it
is
very
good
for
the
style
nice
tart
taste
that
is
as
balanced
as
it
smells
nice
and
sour
although
not
overly
so
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
would
love
to
enjoy
on
a
nice
warm
day
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
and
i
would
love
to
try
an
older
vintage
to
see
if
the
brett
can
get
to
work
a
little
more
light
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
and
a
dry
mouthfeel

beer
poured
into
a
duvel
tulip
quickly
forms
a
four
finger
head
bubbles
vibrantly
race
to
feed
the
head
beer
is
a
honey
colored
haze
and
it
looks
great
smell
is
musty
hay
and
lemons
wow
this
beer
is
sour
lemons
come
through
in
the
taste
as
well
no
hops
no
sweetness
beer
is
very
lively
on
toungue
a
refreshing
beer
but
quite
different
than
anything
ive
had
before
and
youll
need
to
like
a
sour
taste
it
grew
on
me
as
i
drank
it
though
d
easy
drinking
for
a
sour
goes
down
very
well
and
makes
me
keep
wanting
more
d
why
cant
i
drink
this
every
day
this
is
a
jewel
i
love
the
style
and
they
are
experts
i
wanted
to
savor
this
but
my
glass
just
kept
getting
empty
i
know
it
is
a
low
abv
beer
but
god
damn
i
would
kill
you
for
a
never
ending
keg
of
this
at
my
house
enjoyed
a
bottle
of
this
at
the
kulminator
in
antwerp
pours
a
light
glowing
orange
apple
juice
color
very
lively
smells
sour
and
of

incredibly
complex
fruit
and
citrus
flavors
with
a
beautiful
balance
mouthfeel
is
pretty
similar
to
champagne
lively
carbonation
and
nice
dry
finish
for
how
sour
this
beer
is
because
of
its
flavor
and
complexity
it
is
much
easier
to
drink
my
introduction
into
the
lambic
world
and
i
will
definitely
try
another

not
as
sour
as
i
normally
like
but
well
balanced
and
refreshing
also
may
be
the
funkiest
beer
ive
really
enjoyed
not
my
favorite
gueuze
but
quite
tasty
worth
a
shot
if
you
can
fit
it
in
the
budget
this
is
my
first
beer
of
this
style
and
my
first
sour
beer
something
unusual
to
have
bottle
marked
1999
poured
a
hazy
goldenmarmalade
beneath
a
creamy
white
head
aromas
of
mineral
granite
wet
leather
basement
mustiness
citrus
and
tropical
fruit
the
flavor
is
brash
and
tart
displaying
notes
of
wood
cheese
fruit
leather
straw
ripped
tin
and
suggestions
of
blood
citrus
and
shit
quite
the
stunner
for
fans
of
geuze
this
one
should
not
be
missed
for
the
uninitiated
please
stay
away
leaving
more
for
us
try
something
with
a
bit
of
fruit
first
overall
i
opened
this
beer
after
reading
that
this
was
a
good
beer
to
act
as
a
gateway
into
sours
and
lambics
because
it
wasnt
extremely
sour
i
definitely
have
to
agree
this
was
a
very
refreshing
and
pleasant
experience
that
makes
me
want
to
experiment
more
with
this
style
of
beer
very
impressive
now
i
need
a
few
bottles
to
age
ive
come
to
the
sad
realization
that
im
just
not
a
fan
of
sour
beers
i
really
want
to
like
them
but
i
found
this
beer
to
be
too
sourdrytartvinegary
white
grape
rinds
and
acetic
acid
lended
the
flavor
a
good
deal
of
pungency
and
the
light
body
was
exceedingly
dry
wellcarbonated
crisp
and
mouthpuckeringly
tart
the
4
oz
i
had
of
this
shared
bottle
were
almost
more
than
i
could
handle
although
sour
beers
arent
for
me
i
did
enjoy
cantillons
lou
pepe
significantly
more
than
this
gueuze
this
is
a
standout
for
style
beer
the
aroma
is
sour
with
tart
fruit
lactic
bacteria
yeast
urine
wood
and
sugar
the
appearance
is
cloudy
and
copper
with
a
small
head
the
flavor
is
tangy
is
like
the
aroma
the
palate
is
average
overall
not
something
i
want
again
despite
being
complex
and
highly
ranked
here
rerated
with
a
1999
vintage
tasted
in
january
07
and
the
second
time
around
with
the
older
vintage
i
enjoy
quite
a
bit
more

thanks
joe
drinkability
was
quite
good
for
the
style
the
beer
was

definitely
worth
trying
if
you
are
into

750ml

ive
been
waiting
to
give
this
one
a
shot
hope
its
funky
beautiful
orange
color
with
a
good
head
at
first
then
scarce
bubbles
the
smell
is
real
nice
candy
fruit
peaches
a
little
basement
nice
and
sour
juicy
like
apples
and
pears
it
feels
like
very
tiny
bubbles
as
far
as
mouthfeel
goes
this
is
very
very
well
made
not
overwhelming
and
with
nothing
out
of
balance
i
still
have
that
lingering
feeling
there
could
be
more
but
im
not
going
to
complain
this
might
be
a
good
entry
into
the
world
of
sour
beers
for
someone
as
it
isnt
too
sour
to
get
ones
tastebuds
around
yet
its
enough
that
theyll
know
theyre
drinking
something
radically
different
than
anything
theyve
had
before
strongly
recommended
overall
makin
my
way
the
only
way
i
know
how
but
thats
just
a
little
bit
more
than
the
law
will
allow
d
amazing
gueze
i
love
drinking
this
however
there
is
so
much
sourness
and
tart
that
lingers
in
the
finish
and
complexity
in
the
body
that
this
is
something
best
enjoyed
slowly
and
on
special
occasions
d
very
drinkable
for
the
style
a
stellar
offering
for
a
style
thats
a
challenge
for
drinkability
very
enjoyable
im
enjoying
my
second
glass
of
this
with
cypress
grove
pepper
chevre
which
is
a
very
nice
pairing
if
youre
so
inclined
drinkability
not
for
everybody
obviously
and
like
many
a
lambic
something
to
be
savored
in
the
right
setting

a

this

with

the
citrusy
taste
is
apparent
in

and
it
sticks
to
the
roof
of
the

a

very
well
done
also
an
incredible

the
carbonation
is
superb
and
adds
to
the
overall
refreshingness
of
the
beer
and
the
smoothness
somehow
compliments
and
contrasts
with
tartness
and
subtle
sweetness
a
truly
wellcrafted
guezue
i
could
drink
this
beer
all
day
and
still
not
completely
understand
it
d
pucker
up
a

squinter
here
a
bomber
may
be
a

for
the
novice
or
even
intermediate
lambic
drinker
so
beware
best
shared
with
a
friend
after
the
first
couple
of
sips
the
beer
does
become
moderately
easier
to
handle
but
does
pack
a
punch
to
it
this
is
a
very
impressive
beer
and
worthy
of
the
many
accolades
it
receives
its
packed
full
of
flavor
and
is
very
complex
easily
one
of
the

there
highly

not
for
the
weak
a
sour
rotten
taste
as
it
warms
and
as
the
alcohol
kicks
in
its
more
palatable
a
great
gueuze
some
more
funk
in
the
nose
and
this
would
rank
amongst
my
top
10
or
so
favorite
beers
hazy
golden
orange
color
with
a
quick

gueuze
aromas
of
lemon
grapefruit
and
a
small
amount
of
funk
dry
and
sour
with
some
sweetness
im
drinking
pink
grapefruit
juice
this
is
seriously
good
stuff
very
addicting
my
new
favorite
gueuze
drinks
really
easy
but
the
tartness
would
get
to
me
after
a
while
great
example
of
the
style
a
nice
change
of
pace
my
last
gueuze
was
the
cantillon
which
nearly
puckered
my
mouth
beyond
recognition
so
i
was
rather
apprehensive
when
i
decided
to
tackle
an
entire
bottle
of
this
by
myself
i
poured
it
into
a
dogfish
head
oversized
wine
goblet
from
the
750ml
corked
and
caged
bottle
the
color
emerges
as
a
hazy
orange
with
a
foamy
off
white
head
the
foam
fizzles
down
to
a
ring
and
wisps
across
the
top
leaving
some
lace
down
the
sides
the
aroma
is
dominated
by
pears
and
tart
apples
but
has
hints
of
spicy
farmhouse
ale
characteristics
the
taste
is
where
this
beer
truly
shines
certainly
tart
pear
and
apples
up
front
but
for
all
of
the
tartness
that
exists
here
there
is
an
equal
amount
of
sweetness
in
balance
there
is
a
bit
of
haybarnyard
type
of
flavors
in
the
finish
as
well
the
body
is
lightmedium
with
full
effervescent
carbonation
that
adds
to
the
body
it
is
amazing
how
drinkable
this
beer
is
you
really
get
a
nice
tartness
but
it
is
wonderfully
refreshing
and
not
overpowering
instead
of
fearing
the
tartness
of
the
next
drink
your
palate
feels
refreshed
and
eager
for
another
taste
this
has
to
be
my
favorite
gueuze
at
the
moment
i
think
my
count
is
4
and
i
would
readily
pay
the
money
for
this
one
again
drinkability
again
as
my
first
in
this
style
this
is
tough
i
dont
see
myself
drinking
this
again
in
the
near
future
it
isnt
that
its
bad
only
foreign
to
me
in
so
many
ways
i
will
probably
seek
out
others
in
the
same
style
revisiting
this
one
once
i
have
a
better
handle
on
the
style
the
drinkability
is
pretty
good
its
powerfully
sour
but
retains
a
degree
of
refreshing
palate
cleansing
and
puckering
good
flavor
drinkability
is
great
nice
balance
the
lack
of
carbonation
might
even
improve
the
drinkability
since
it
helps
ease
the
acidic
feel
love
the
depth
of
the
funk
amazing
example
of
a
vintage
gueze
guido
the
brother
who
is
in
charge
of
the
kitchen
at
drie
fonteinen
says
that
1997
is
their
best
vintage
i
believe
that
a
comparison
to
a
newer
vintage
may
be
unfair
since
back
then
i
think
they
were
blending
guezes
from
other
lambic
brewers
before
they
more
recently
began
brewing
their
own
lambics
for
blending
magnificent
and
only
11
euros
i
think
at
the
brewpub
poured
from
a
12
7oz
caged
and
corked
bottle
dated
nov
30
2005
and
served
in
a
tumbler
this
beer
poured
a
hazy
glowing
orange
with
a
twofinger
thick
head
of
tight
beige
fizz
that
slowly
faded
away
into
a
thin
lasting
cap
not
much
lace
to
speak
of
the
aroma
of
the
beer
was
made
up
of
oak
grass
oranges
along
with
loads
of
funk
the
flavor
was
very
woody
and
earthy
lots
of
wet
wood
mildly
tart
acidity
sourdough
and
a
light
citrus
sweetness
extremely
funky
but
not
overly
sour
the
mouthfeel
was
light
to
mediumbodied
and
a
bit
crisp
with
modest
carbonation
insanely
drinkable
and
thirstquenching
lovely
stuff
a
hazy
cedar
color
with
a
silky
tan
head
a
beautifull
gueze
the
nose
has
tart
citrus
fruit
musky
funk
some
oak
and
some
subtle
candy
malts
the
flavor
is
immensely
complex
yet
perfectly
balanced
lots
of
sour
fruits
earthy
funk
herbs
vanilla
oak
and
a
complex
malt
profile
pefect
body
full
yet
crisp
and
delicate
nice
dry
finish
i
could
drink
this
all
night
ages
very
well
d
very
enjoyable
with
a
nice
woody
quality
to
it
that
i
couldnt
put
my
finger
on
bottom
line
if
you
like
weird
beer
this
one
is
great
its
a
perfect
example
of
the
oude
gueze
style
and
will
give
you
plenty
to
think
about
a
delicious
but
pricey
offering
of
a
belgian
gueuze
with
the
sourpuckering
of
lacto
followed
with
the
barnyard
aromas
and
horseblanket
brett
character
a
nice
blend
of
old
and
new
gueuze
to
create
a
drinkable
product
i
could
see
cellaring
this
beer
to
meld
the
flavors
even
more
cant
wait
to
try
the
kriek
version
d
slightly
more
drinkable
than
most
guezes
d
the
smell
took
some
away
from
the
taste
but
overall
this
drank
quite
nice
for
a
4
year
oude
geuze
im
new
to
this
style
but
i
like
it
pours
golden
with
no
head
smell
is
musty
funky
and
fairly
standard
i
thought
generally
unappealing
to
me
taste
is
tart
but
less
so
than
the
cantillon
classic
geuze
somewhat
musty
dirty
but
with
a
sharp
oaky
sourness
thank
you
kmpitz2
for
blessing
me
with
this
little
midnight
snack
the
carbonation
was
spritzy
the
mouthfeel
was
reasonably
crisp
slightly
fuller
bodied
and
sweeter
than
cantillon
gueuzes
which
took
away
from
the
drinkability
imo
drinkability
a
very
good
beer
complex
and
refreshing
in
the
traditional
gueuze
style
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
with
a
very
low
carbonation
with
a
good
drinkability
i
had
this
beer
a
couple
of
years
ago
and
did
not
care
for
it
or
really
any
geuze
really
at
that
time
i
recently
tried
a
geuze
at
a
beer
tasting
adn
was
surprised
how
i
njoyed
i
decided
i
had
o
give
this
another
shot
and
im
glad
i
did
overall
easily
one
of
the
best
beers
regardless
of
style
that
i
have
ever
had
the
pleasure
of
drinking
there
isn
ot
a
bad
word
that
could
be
said
about
this
it
was
literally
the
epitome
of
the
style
for
me
and
i
would
love
to
get
another
of
these
amazingly
complex
beer
and
something
i
think
everyone
should
get
to
try
at
some
point
taste
wonderfully
funky
and
sour
but
not
over
the
top
in
either
character
tart
unripe
fruit
is
at
the
forefront
here
with
earthy
undertones
of
oak
and
hay
a
touch
of
vanilla
is
present
in
the
background
leaving
the
faintest
hint
of
sweetness
on
the
tongue
fairly
low
acidity
makes
this
a
very
drinkable
gueuze
my
only
gripe
is
that
the
finish
could
use
a
bit
more
oak
otherwise
this
is
top
notch
one
of
the
more
complex
geuzes
ive
sampled
but
not
sure
how
much
is
due
to
age
as
ive
yet
to
try
a
fresh
sample
wow
what
a
treat
if
im
feeling
like
a
gueuze
this
will
be
the
one
i
grab
for
sure
id
love
to
try
a
fresher
version
of
this
to
compare
to
the
2
year
old
one
i
had
tonight
overall
one
of
the
best
if
not
the
best
gueuze
ive
ever
had
the
acidity
is
calmer
than
most
and
the
tartness
doesnt
linger
the
vanilla
and
oak
are
more
prominent
than
in
other
lambics
ive
tried
which
is
very
pleasant
the
fruit
grass
and
spice
notes
combine
very
nicely
i
find
it
interesting
that
they
use
a
6040
ratio
of
barley
to
wheat
as
opposed
to
the
usual
6535
and
that
the
alcohol
is
high
for
the
style
id
love
to
try
an
older
example
this
beer
poured
a
cloudy
orange
color
and
formed
a
nice
off
white
foamy
head
the
left
lattticed
lace
as
it
subsided
a
medium
amount
of
carbonation
is
present
an
aroma
of
citrus
yeast
and
that
musty
aroma
of
gueze
styles
the
flavor
was
of
citrus
and
bread
the
body
was
medium
light
and
the
finish
quite
tart
but
typical
of
the
style
a
nice
beer
drinkability
is
low
to
moderate
the
sour
in
this
beer
can
be
overwhelming
but
the
flavor
is
quite
nice
definitely
share
the
bottle
i
drank
the
bulk
of
the
bottle
but
i
did
share
a
few
glasses
of
this
750
and
it
was
difficult
at
the
end
to
finish
my
taste
buds
were
shot
for
the
rest
of
the
night
bottom
line
a
very
tasty
and
enjoyable
sipping
example
of
the
style
that
i
can
only
recommend
but
id
also
recommend
trying
before
buyingif
at
all
possible
because
sour
ales
arent
everyones
cup
of
tea
could
use
a
bit
more
carbonation
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
flat
i
like
more
of
a
champagne
rather
than
a
white
wine
feel
still
very
good
the
flavors
of
this
beer
have
blinded
me
looks
are
not
important
at
this
point
after
a
bit
of
vinegar
smell
i
should
have
been
ready
but
i
wasnt
taste
is
sour
vinegar
not
much

a

with
a
slight
dirty
blonde
hue
nice
champagne
like
head
that
left
little
after
a
minute
the
smell
was
a
mixture
of
sour
fresh
musty
citrus
a
bit
of
brett
and
barnyard
funk
finish
taste
is
pleasantly
sour
kind
of
like
a
lemon
teaish
flavor
with
a
slight
acidic
vingear
present
and
the
drynish
that
on
the
finish
mixed
with
the
champagne
like
carbonation
makes
this
a
great
example
of
gueuze
the
cork
came
out
of
the
bottle
without
any
pressure
it
poured
a
clear
orange
color
with
no
head
at
all
the
aroma
is
dry
and
sour
with
hints
of
sour
apples
and
some
barnyard
character
the
flavor
isnt
overly
sour
it
is
flat
though
and
it
makes
it
very
boring
to
drink
thin
mouthfeel
i
would
like
to
try
an
older
version
t
very
refreshing
and
pleasurable
to
drink
excellent
appearance
was
an
attractive
hazy
straw
color
with
two
fingers
of
fluffy
white
head
aroma
was
a
mix
of
light
champagne
character
acetic
vinegarness
and
a
bit
of
freshcut
apple
fruitiness
this
beer
also
seemed
a
bit
lightstruck
flavor
was
rather
sour
but
didnt
totally
make
me
pucker
there
was
also
some
light
apple
and
champagne
notes
mouthfeel
was
fairly
light
and
bubbley
and
appropriate
i
did
enjoy
this
beer
and
would
recommend
it
d
a
funkybeer
lovers
wet
dream
absolutely
wonderful
and
worth
whatever
it
takes
to
get
some
bottle
picked
up
at
city
wide
liquors
in
south
bend
although
the
bottle
was
smaller
and
looked
like
the
vintage

version
this
one

nov

2005
poured
bubbly
and
red
to
orange
brown
on
the
pour
with
a
puffy

head
the
head
disappeared
almost
immediately
and
the
beer
really
calmed
down

then
some
brettybarnyardness
on
the

second
sip
is
much
more
subdued
once
all
my
tastebuds
have
been
smached
to
bits
dry
tart
cherries
in
vanilla
and
oak
flavor
rich
and
effervescent
towards
the
end
of
the
glass
the
horsey
flavor
and
fruits
meld
nicely
and
its
a
real
pleasure
medium
bodied
and
well
balanced
very
nice
im
not
too
experienced
with
the
style
but
i
enjoyed
it
and
would
have
it
again
its
obviously
really
sour
but
the
spiciness
is
unique
enough
to
make
you
come
back
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
but
i
do
like
this
item
and
might
revisit
it
if
the
price
is
right
d
the
moderate
abv
is
great
allowing
for
a
fullbodied
and
flavorful
ale
with
a
10
abv
pricetag
i
am
not
a
100
convert
to
this
style
but
im
working
on
it
d
this
beer
has
a
nice
full
pucker
and
tartness
but
it
as
some
good
subtle
qualities
that
keep
developing
with
each
sip
the
smell
and
flavors
were
big
and
bold
but
i
didnt
feel
like
they
were
punishingly
large
not
much
carbonation
after
an
aggressive
pour
into
a
tulip
glass
head
seems
composed
of
air
bubbles
instead
of
co2
bubbles
im
worried
this
might
be
oxidized
smell
is
of
sour
citrus
musty
yeast
and
hay
taste
is
of
lemon
apple
skin
a
faint
sugary
sweetness
a
hint
of
champagney
grape
very
sour
and
a
little
dirty
on
the
mouthfeel
quite
drinkable
for
the
amount
of
sourness
however
for
my
complaints
lack
of
carbonation
initial
sour
burst
being
a
bit
much
this
beer
is
immensely
drinkable
tart
with
notes
of
sour
cherry
a
bit
of
oak
tannin
id
love
to
retry
closer
to
the
source
and
would
gladly
join
anyone
in
a
glass
on
their
dime
at
this
price
to
be
holding
up
this
poorly
sucks
pours
a
hazy
orange
color
head
settled
fairly
quickly
smell
is
huge
the
expected
sour
aroma
is
prevalent
along
with
some
faint
malty
aroma
taste
is
sour
citrus
particularly
lemon
some
wheat
flavor
as
well
mouthfeel
is
effervescent
and
smooth
drinkability
is
quite
good
especially
for
fans
of
the
style
some
may
be
put
off
by
the
sour
taste
and
aroma
but
its
surprisingly
good
750ml
caged
corked
dated
18205
pours
a
clear
effervescent
amber
with
a
very
thick
rocky
head
that
undulates
and
heaves
like
im
writting
a
letter
to
an
entirely
different
kind
of
web
site
the
smell
is
musty
sour
sharp
and
sweet
yes
all
of
those
medicinal
esters
add
their
note
as
well
the
taste
is
dry
and
crisp
then
decidedly
sour
very
delicate
and
champagnelike
up
front
with
a
sour
lambic
wallop
that
hits
you
hard
the
mouthfeel
is
really
light
and
airy
but
surprisingly
substantial
does
not
come
off
as
watery
at
all
which
is
remarkable
given
its
light
body
and
crisp
bubbly
texture
the
drinkability
is
very
good
although
the
sour
finish
will
put
some
off
of
course
it
will
probably
put
off
those
who
wouldnt
be
interested
in
a
geuze
to
begin
with
and
thats
not
me
so
im
not
worried
d
highly
drinkable
for
all
the
tartness
going
on
i
will
need
to
try
an
older
vintage
and
see
what
time
does
to
it
a
faint
pop
of
the
cork
reveals
that
there
isnt
much
carbonation
with
this
one
pours
a
glowing
gold
with
a
thin
layer
of
foam
that
coats
the
surface
and
slowly
disappears
over
the
next
510
minutes
the
aroma
is
awesome
mister
ed
meets
parliament
im
in
for
a
treat
the
initial
taste
puckers
my
mouth
like
no
other
i
can
feel
it
all
the
way
back
at
the
top
of
my
jaw
yum
there
is
a
slight
bitterness
buried
underneath
all
the
sharp
acidity
but
this
is
all
about
the
sour
funk
great
beer
but
it
could
use
a
little
more
carbonation
i
could
drink
this
on
occasion
but
not
every
occasion
still
a
great
sour
beer
i
think
i
like
the
kriek
de
ranke
better
overall
a
very
pungent
but
surprisingly
refreshing
beer
that
i
wish
i
had
some
more
of
pours
out
like
a
white
wine
all
fizzy
yet
holds
a
head
color
is
brownish
gold
and
crystal
clear
smell
is
sour
with
some
clear
notes
of
horse
blanket
and
citrus
fruit
taste
is
sour
and
theres
a
lot
of
sour
lemon
flavor
this
doesnt
give
me
a
sour
face
mouthfeel
is
really
great
the
carbonation
is
smooth
and
soft
on
the
palate
overall
i
think
this
is
my
best
geuze
ever
i
would
like
to
get
lots
more
of
this
this
is
a
tasty
sipper
with
a
great
woody
character
this
is
an
infinitely
complex
gueuze
this
is
a
beer
to
slip
slowly
to
savour
the
developing
nuances
incredible
stuff
a
very
nice
oude
gueze
serious
carbonation
a
really
impressively
light
and
springy
beer
mouthfeel
is
just
about
right
for
the
style
very
good
in
fact
sharpness
on
the
tongue
some
spicing
finishes
quite
dry
drinkability
hurts
just
because
of
the
extreme
sourness
in
the
flavor
for
fans
of
sour
belgians
d
this
was
good
but
wasnt
my
favorite
gueze
highly
recommended
to
sour
lovers
though
drinkability
unique
flavor
that
continues
to
go
down
pleasantly
becomes
very
tasty
by
midbottle
once
ones
palate
adjusts
to
the
pungent
tartness
very
nice
depending
on
your
individual
tastes
this
is
a
drinkable
gueze
it
is
certainly
an
acquired
taste
but
if
youre
looking
for
something
different
this
is
it

it

experience
i
am
moved
by
this
beer
in
ways
which
few
beers
have
moved

it
is
delicate
suprisingly

its

pours
an
orange
tinged
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
healthy
tight
bubbled
pure
white
head
that
diminishes
but
never
really
dissipates
the
smell
is
acetic
and
lightly
bitter
but
not
from
hops
a
little
funkiness
but
very
little
barnyard
aromas
i
think
more
time
in
the
bottle
might
develop
those
smells
the
taste
is
fairly
complex
the
flavor
starts
out
with
balanced
sour
and
bitter
flavors
and
then
slowly
develops
some
more
funkiness
not
too
barnyardy
but
definitely
some
ripe
cheese
flavors
there
is
a
lactic
sharpness
at
the
end
that
is
pretty
refreshing
a
fairly
light
body
and
pretty
crisp
as
well
very
drinkable
stuff
and
interesting
enough
to
hold
your
interest
not
as
acidic
as
i
expected
and
for
sure
a
good
beer
but
not
something
i
will
buy
frequently
in
the
future
mouthfeel
is
zingy
with
a
light
body
notes
of
tart
apple
star
fruit
persimmons
are

along

i

the
other
one
i
tried
i
think
ill
buy
another
bottle
and
sit

overall
this

is
an
experience
i
look

more

appears
hazy
and
the
color
seems
to
alternate
between
a
bright
orange
and
yellow
the
carbonation
is
subtle
while
a
nice
ring
of
foam
lingers
about
the
edges
the
aroma
is
beautifully
sour
with
notes
of
lemon
and
peach
plus
an
oaked
vinegar
spice
behind
the
tart
fruity
esters
there
is
the
faintest
hint
of
cherry
sweetness
coming
through
in
the
background
the
intitial
taste
is
a
blast
of
sour
woody
funk
the
sourness
is
pretty
intense
but
does
soften
some
after
a
few
sips
the
finish
fades
somewhat
with
a
dry
cheeselike
touch
nice
flavor
but
lacking
the
mix
of
fruits
evident
in
the
aroma
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
smooth
with
semisharp
carbonation
this
is
a
very
nice
gueze
and
one
of
my
favorites
not
that
i
have
tried
many
i
particularly
enjoyed
the
nose
on
this
one
and
if
it
were
available
in
my
area
i
might
get
a
few
bottles
and
cellar
them
750
ml
from
the
first
cork
pop
to
the
last
sip
this
geuze
has
an
aroma
that
tickles
the
nose
and
a
flavor

that
dances
on
the
tongue

a

bitterness
in

toward
the

with
time
before
finishing
very
dryly
mouthfeel
is
as
one
would
expect
very
acidic
with

overall
a
highly
dynamic
prototypical
gueuze
overall
an
excellent
gueuze
its
sour
and
funky
but
has
a
nice
underlying
sweetness
given
the
above
its
easy
to
see
how
many
would
not
like
this
style
of
beer
i
however
think
its
great
this
one
was
spot
on
for
a
gueuze
and
the
flavors
were
just
what
i
was
looking
for
a
super
dry
mouthfeel
and
puckering
taste
that
was
quite
pleasing
i
would
have
liked
just
a
touch
more
carbonation

more
then

im
thirsty
but
wary
lest
i
challenge
my
constitution
too
aggressively
i
feel
i
have
to
allow
this
beer
to
encounter
my
body
like
two
strange
dogs
meeting
for
the
first
time
i
may
not
move
for
an
hour
as
i
sip
this
i
feel
as
though
i
were
passing
a
comfrey
leaf
across
my
tongue
the
sourness
builds
like
licking
a
lime
over
and
over
this
geueze
plays
the
trumpet
md
very
smoothlycarbonated
and
lightbodied
ideal
for
an
oude
geuze
and
outperforms
quite
a
few
competitors
this
2004
vintage
doesnt
disappoint
at
all
yet
it
shows
a
slightly
different
profile
than
the
fouryearold
2002
vintage
ive
tasted
for
more
than
four
times
this
year
memories
are
hazy
i
guess
i
must
seize
the
moment
to
open
another
bottle
of
2002
tomorrow
to
compare
a
fine
geuze
anyway
notes
2
years
old
and
still
has
some
time
to
go
as
it
comes
across
a
bit
on
the
raw
side
not
a
knock
at
all
as
it
was
magnificent
i
just
think
it
needs
a
few
more
years
wish
i
could
find
this
more
often
and
lay
a
few
down
but
i
couldnt
wait
to
try
this
drinkability
i
would
definitely
pair
this
with
some
stilton
and
i
think
it
would
be
superb
this
beer
is
excellent
on
its
own
however
i
have
not
had
better
in
the
style
the
smell
is
good
a
light
lactic
sourness
blends
with
a
nice
oakiness
and
smooth
malt
aromas
the
taste
is
incredible
has
a
nice
sour
apple
lactic
flavor
along
with
some
complex
woodiness
not
too
acidic
one
of
the
few
really
sour
beers
that
doesnt
seem
to
give
me
heartburn
even
though
i
never
get
it
from
food
i
cant
begin
to
explain
the
complexities
or
even
why
i
like
it
as
much
as
i
do
when
i
dont
like
other
gueuzes
ive
had
i
can
only
suggest
that
you
try
it
for
yourself
d
refined
and
well
balanced
although
somehow
i
was
expecting
more
nevertheless
definitely
worth
trying
an
amazing
gueuze
probably
the
best
ive
had
to
date
a
truly
epic
mother
of
a
beer
drinkability
notes

despite
the
fact
that
this
bottle
suffered
from
lack
of
carbonation
this
is
probably
the
best
geuze
that
i
have
had
i
will
have
to
find
another
bottle
because
it
doesnt
seem
as
if
other
reviewers
mention
the
lack
of
carbonation
a
real
winner
worth
the
13
i
dropped
on
this
sharp
funkysour
aroma
smells
of
tart
chinese
baby
corn
orange
body
holds
a
lazy
dime
thin
white
head
that
diminishes
slowly
tart
and
acidic
with
lots
of
funk
laden
fruit
flavors
in
the
fore
some
overripe
citrus
and
pear
in
the
middle
and
a
mouth
puckering
sourness
in
the
finish
this
has
to
be
the
most
uncomerical
style
of
beer
in
the
world
there
is
a
very
nice
balance
of
sour
fruit
sweetness
tart
and
bitter
with
none
truly
dominating
and
all
getting
a
little
stage
time
high
carbonation
and
a
lightmedium
refreshing
mouthfeel
initial
lemony
citrusy
sweetness
gives
way
to
a
drying
astringent
puckering
tartness
that
makes
the
mouth
water
hints
of
dry
cider
grapefruit
rinds
and
belgian
yeast
an
intense
finish
that
takes
the
drinkability
down
and
would
likely
make
this
a
bad
gueuze
for
an
introduction
to
the
style
but
a
very
wellcrafted
brew
opinion
i
am
really
enjoying
this
beer
it
is
really
clean
and
absolutely
refreshing
there
is
an
amazing
depth
of
flavor
to
this
beer
and
it
just
gets
deeper
as
the
beer
warms
up
as
i
was
drinking
it
i
was
comparing
it
to
cuvee
renee
in
my
mind
but
this
isnt
a
good
comparison
the
lindemans
is
quite
a
bit
sweeter
like
most
of
their
beers
and
this
one
has
a
bit
drier
and
refreshing
palate
you
could
drink
this
beer
like
a
lawnmower
beer
if
it
werent
for
the
high
carbonation
i
would
definitely
drink
this
beer
again
any
chance
i
got
update
1997
vintage
consumed
at
the
brewery
on
81808
the
bottle
quite
literally
had
a
spider
on
the
webbed
cork
when
it
came
to
the
table
it
was
every
bit
as
good
as
the
newer
vintages
and
then
some
this
one
can
handle
age
very
well
buttery
with
full
lemon
notes
the
flavor
was
not
what
i
expected
the
tartness
was
apparent
but
by
no
means
as
dominant
as
in
the
nose
this
beer
is
dry
dry
dry
i
was
more
thirsty
after
finishing
than
when
i
started
a
sweet
and
sour
flavor
hints
of
apples
maybe
a
hop
bitterness
seemed
to
appear
in
the
swallow
very
good
rustic
peach
skin
in
color
with
a
signature
gigantic
3f
froth
the
nose
is
at
its
best
when
you
let
the
enormous
head
fall
to
about
2
inches
and
what
a
falling
i
might
add
its
very
expressive
at
that
point
compared
to
a
full
huge
froth
which
doesnt
reveal
much
or
a
small
filmy
head
which
is
still
pretty
vibrant
but
not
quite
as
expressive
it
releases
a
very
fruit
filled
aroma
with
hints
of
apples
orange
and
grapefruit
along
with
an
unbelievably
woody
scent
which
hints
of
freshly
cut
burnt
and
white
wine
stained
wood
and
a
touch
of
leather
the
flavor
is
so
fruit
filled
almost
like
a
platter
of
full
gummy
fruits
or
a
packet
of
fruit
snacks
with
easily
detectable
notes
of
peach
nectarine
and
grapefruit
and
perhaps
a
light
hint
of
apple
all
supported
by
a
very
firm
maltiness
a
clean
yet
approachable
tartness
and
an
extraordinary
wood
barrel
character
wow
what
artful
balance
armand
is
the
man
its
amazing
he
can
choose
a
blend
between
girardin
oud
beersel
hanssens
etc
and
come
up
with
a
blend
like
this
while
i
find
some
gueuze
unexciting
frank
boons
oud
beersel
and
franks
boons
lambics
in
general
some
a
bit
harsh
a
few
of
cantillons
offerings
fou
foune
gueuze
although
i
do
love
some
and
some
a
bit
plain
hanssens
i
find
drie
fonteinen
unbelievable
almost
each
time
its
all
about
his
balance
this
lambic
reminded
me
of
how
much
i
love
gueuze
taste
is
huge
extreme
barnyard
at
first
quickly
followed
by
intense
sourness
and
a
sweet
finish
malt
is
observed
as
well
im
going
to
pair
this
with
rare
filet
mignon
hold
on
a
minute
fuk
yeah
the
tastes
of
the
meat
and
the
beer
are
both
big
and
both
stand
up
to
the
other
quite
nicely
mouthfeel
is
still
bubbly
after
the
years
drinkability
is
outstanding
sampled
on
cask
at
the
brewerys
restaurant
a
nice
orange
color
with
the
most
impressive
head
ive
ever
seen
absolutely
solid
formed
a
hole
to
drink
through
like
ice
fishing
but
the
rest
stayed
throughout
when
the
beer
was
gone
the
head
sat
on
the
bottom
of
the
glass
smells
of
funky
complexities
i
finally
know
what
people
mean
by
barnyard
in
a
beer
also
slightly
sweet
and
yeasty
taste
is
everything
it
should
be
dry
mouthfeel
refreshing
and
so
easy
to
drink
that
we
couldnt
believe
how
quickly
a
liter
disappeared
drinkability
with
the
lower
tartness
the
great
flavor
and
the
drying
mouthfeel
leaving
you
wanting
more
this
beer
becomes
one
of
the
most
drinkable
i
have
had
terrific
brew
hazy

plenty
of

the
aroma
was

and
acidic
with
white

dry

lots
of

but
this
was
balanced
masterfully
with
fruit
full
of

light

with
some
tingling
on
the
palate
in
the
finish

great
for
its
style

i
am
trying
the
highest
rated
for
the
experience
vinegar
in
aroma
tough
to
finish
a
bottle
mostly
by
myself
as
my
mates
though
beer
drinkers
were
not
keen
on
it
pours
a
solid
hazy
dark
orange
with
tan
highlites
a
billowing
head
kept
it
from
being
poured
in
one
nice
motion
but
it
recedes
rather
quickly
nose
is
very
sour
and
tart
almost
burning
my
nostrils
seems
to
be
a
bit
of
harsh
grape
rind
in
the
background
along
with
lemon
and
solid
wheaty
notes
very
nice
flavor
is
much
more
subdued
than
the
nose
it
initially
gives
the
impression
that
its
going
to
kick
my
ass
with
sour
and
tart
but
it
starts
to
pucker
my
mouth
and
then
pulls
back
nice
zesty
lemon
sourness
and
acidity
hangs
on
a
little
into
the
finish
and
then
it
finishes
very
wheaty
and
grainey
tasty
brew
feel
is
moderate
with
a
moderate
carbonation
overall
and
incredibly
drinkable
brew
the
nose
is
so
powerful
that
the
flavor
almost
seems
to
be
a
touch
light
but
it
really
isnt
ill
definately
drink
this
one
again
2001
vintage
pours
a
cloudy
orange
color
with
a
tall
head
that
has
nice
retention
and
leaves
a
lot
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
extremely
sour
there
is
definately
a
fruity
character
but
i
cant
tell
what
it
is
behind
the
sourness
hooha
the
flavor
doesnt
have
the
sour
kick
that
the
nose
foretold
the
flavor
is
blended
excessively
well
but
it
still
has
the
sourness
and
the
strong
fruity
character
just
not
at
a
shocking
level
very
smooth
the
body
is
moderate
and
the
drinkability
is
very
good
compared
to
other
gueuze
beers
that
ive
had
im
not
the
biggest
fan
of
this
style
the
overall
acidity
doesnt
really
blow
my
skirt
up
but
i
find
this
a
truly
enjoyable
and
drinkable
example
of
what
can
be
done
when
its
done
properly
given
that
all
the
elements
going
into
the
making
of
it
cooperate
and
things
most
certainly
seemed
to
have
fallen
into
place
this
time
around
thanks
to
phyl21ca
for
the
trade
pours
a
perfect
shade
of
cloudy
apricot
and
creates
a
fluffy
white
head
that
disipates
quickly
aroma
is
full
of
barnyard
and
sharp
cheese
slight
vinegar
sourness
flavor
is
hugely
complex
acidic
sharp
and
sour
citrus
fruit
funky
cheese
and
something
indescribeable
that
i
have
never
experienced
in
any
other
beer
smooth
on
the
palate
finishes
very
dry
this
gueuze
has
such
a
unique
character
it
is
a
real
shame
that
i
only
have
one
bottle
quite
nice
this
is
a
truly
outstanding
beer
and
i
am
really
impressed
1999
upon
removing
the
cork
i
got
a
very
small
pop
and
i
was
even
able
to
put
the
cork
back
into
the
bottle
poured
a
slightly
hazy
golden
color
with
a
medium
sized
white
creamy
head
with
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
of
herbs
brett
vinegar
stinky
socks
and
wood
the
taste
was
very
sour
but
also
included
lots
of
oak
cinnamon
some
apple
watermelon
grapefruit
and
lemon
peel
while
it
was
very
sour
it
seemed
to
lack
the
depth
i
like
to
find

on

purchased
at

in

ga
for
17
bottle
poured
a
clear
orangey
color
lambic
with
a
huge
slightly
offwhite
head
with
excellent
retention
aroma
of
barnyard
and
sourness
is
quite
evident
taste
is
so
well
balance
between
sourness
tart
little
bit
of
acidity
green
apple
with
some
nice
funky
yeast
also
thrown
in
probably
one
of
the
finest
lambic
that
i
had
the
chance
to
try
and
the
fact
that
the
acidity
is
lower
then
cantillon
makes
it
easier
to
drink
larger
quantity
the
mouthfeel
was
very
tart
yet
rounded
and
very
firm
flavours
of
fruit
mentioned
above
in
the
aromas
and
caramelly
sweetness
dominated
through
a
spritzy
and
quenching
effervescence
tart
finish
accented
by
a
fresh
bitterness
made
this
beer
somewhat
less
drinkable
than
a
hefeweizen
but
still
very
pleasant
if
you
are
a
fan
of
gueuze
i
shall
order
many
bottles
of
this
brew
when
i
have
a
chance
the
smell
was
just
too
much
april
2009
update
popped
open
another
of
the
2002
bottles
mellowed
out
even
more
the
acidity
is
very
subdued
clarity
is
really
good
i
dont
detect
the
peachy
notes
anymore
but
it
is
still
a
bit
fruity
with
cork
sourdough
and
buttery
notes
the
distinct
flavors
described
in
the
original
review
have
mellowed
to
the
point
that
you
cant
really
discern
them
anymore
still
a
brilliant
geuze
and
i
am
sad
to
say
that
this
is
one
of
only
4
remaining
in
my
cellar
update

i
popped
an
04
vintage
in
2006
and
it
is
right
on
track
with
my
initial
review
of
this
gem
the
carbonation
is
huge
and
tight
the
stank
blooming
from
the
get
go
and
the
farmy
flavors
are
not
to
be
messed
with
april
2001
vintage
wow
what
a
noisy
beer
i
chose
a
champagne
flute
and
it
was
the
right
choice
to
channel
the
creamy
and
noisy
head
the
bubbles
just
kept
rising
so
i
could
only
pour
half
the
flute
this
is
not
over
the
top
in
lambic
funkiness
or
tartness
but
the
nose
does
give
you
fair
warning
that
this
is
not
cider
the
taste
is
wonderful
and
close
second
to
my
favorite
cantillon
gueuze
there
are
a
complex
set
of
flavors
blue
cheese
honey
apple
melon
and
pear
cider
the
one
drawback
is
price
which
i
think
was
18

at

ml
april
2001
bottle
had
the
option

and
chose
this
one
hazy
golden
with
a
perfect

good
barnyard
and
blue

thing
going
on
in
the

flavor
has
a
slightly
soured
blue
cheese
thing
going
on
as
well
malty
smooth
palate
rich
in
funky
flavor
man
really
cheesey
now
i
get
cheddar
very
sharp
cheddar
in
the
finish
i
guess
i
can
just
sit
here
and
twist
all
of
the
flavors
and
aromas
into
different
things
and
maybe
even
write
a
book
must
get
back
to
my
source
top
secret
and
snag
other
vintages
for
sampling
dont
know
if
i
put
this

upon

my

assumation
that
the

is
confirmed
it
is
not
bonejarringly
dry

retains
a
mellow
residual
sweetness
underneath
the
complex
layers
of
tastes
that
assault
the
palate
its
rather
unique
in
a
way
im
not
sure
i
can
describe
it
is
sour
in
a
way
that
comes
across
as
metallic
as
well
as
barnyardy
earthy

very
very
nice
beer
altogether
and
just
about
the
best
gueuze
ive
tried

date
an

than
many
this

has

im

it
pours
a

gold
with
some

tint
but
it
is
a
bit
too
hazy
to
look
nice
of
course
the
look
of
this
beer
is
by
far
the
worst
characteristic
the
big
head
even
seems
to
dissipate
too
fast
the
aroma
is
musty
barnyard
apple
and

i
am
salivating
already
the
sourness
is
big
and
up

then
the

coats
my
tongue
before
the
honey
and

that
fade
to

750ml
bottle
drank
in
the
comfort
of
me
own
home
a
nice
golden
brew
that
borders
on
orange
a
huge
white
head
that
settles
down
to
a
skim
on
the
perimeter
of
the
brew
the
aromas
are
sweet
reminiscent
of
gueuze
and
yet
also
mead
at
the
same
time
ever
have
mead
the
gueuze
well
this
smells
like
that
should
smell
similar
yet
with
much
more
going
on
the
taste
is
awesome
a
nice
blend
of
pure
lambic
funk
and
sweet
honeylike
tones
the
acid
is
ahrp
and
biting
but
whisked
away
on
wings
of
honey
the
mouthfeel
is
sharp
and
acidic
but
not
biting
and
the
drinkability
is
excellent
very
nicely
done
bought
the
2001
bottling
based
on
how
damn
delicious
the
1999
was
that
my
shelton
rep
ron
introduced
me
to
the
cork
shot
out
of
this
bottle
like
a
rocket
and
traveled
a
good
15
yards
before
settling
to
eartha
nice
carry
the
pour
was
more
than
ambitious
and
proffered
up
a
very
energetic
and
bouncy
head
that
lasted
just
long
enough
for
the
eye
and
subsided
quickly
enough
for
the
tongue
to
take
over
aromas
were
perfectly
sour
with
saddle
leather
and
old
wood
and
a
lingering
twang
that
begged
to
be
tasted
in
the
mouth
this
beer
expanded
like
a
rocket
with
each
sip
filling
the
mouth
with
light
and
vibrant
foam
the
flavors
were
deep
and
complex
all
the
while
being
airy
light
and
highly
refreshingmuch
like
a
fine
champagne
sour
as
hell
but
smooth
as
silk
and
balanced
like
a
champthis
was
a
delight
to
taste
and
ill
be
tasting
another
as
soon
as
i
can
muster
up
the
cash
dont
miss
it
the
color
before
decanting
a
limpid
golden
orange
and
after
decanting
a
bemused
golden
orange
with
the
head
a
majestic
crown
upon
that
vaporous
golden
orange
body
which
is
spumous
in
texture
and
a
somewhat
off
white
color
and
the
resultant
lace
a
silky
veil
to
hide
the
glass
from
prying
eyes
the
first
aroma
that
of
peaches
sweet
and
sour
almost
astringent
crisp
and
pleasing
to
both
the
ocular
and
olfactory
senses
start
is
modestly
sweet
dry
hints
of
lemon
with
the
top
light
but
pleasingly
so
finish
is
amaroidal
but
once
again
pleasingly
so
an
integral
part
of
the
style
a
bit
of
the
hops
i
think
shows
through
at
the
back
of
the
palate
so
very
tart
it
puckers
the
mouth
but
its
just
part
of
the
majesty
of
the
style
what
a
treat
and
this
may
be
sacrilegious
but
i
like
this
lambic
much
more
than
any
ive
ever
sampled
including
but
not
limited
to
cantillon
bottled
1999
murky
amber
hue
lean
but
well
retained
cream
white
head
leaves
loose
meandering
lace
the
aroma
is
comprised
of
pungently
overripe
moldy
peach
along
with
bile
acid
tones
softens
steadily
as
it
breathes
with
softer
citric
sour
lemon
notes
and
earthy
humus
tones
providing
delicate
contrast
in
flavor
brett
wastes
no
time
and
envelops
the
palate
with
damp
horseblanket
and
dirty
hay
barbed
acetic
sherry
wine
vinegar
pierces
through
and
the
stubborn
wild
yeast
relinquishes
its
hold
fruit
of
an
obviously
tart
underripe
nature
ensues
in
the
form
of
cranberry
juice
and
nappy
crabapple
gentle
buttermilk
like
lactic
notes
manage
to
eek
in
as
well
and
provide
a
gentle
curdled
skim
milk
impression
very
well
attenuated
yet
with
a
softly
dextrinous
mouthfeel
trace
bitter
lemon
rind
notes
surface
late
along
with
simply
tart
malic
acid
hints
do
lambics
undergo
malolactic
conversion
if
so
this
fine
brew
should
become
unbelievably
smooth
with
additional
cellaring
finishes
with
a
snap
of
pear
like
sweetness
but
otherwise
with
a
puckering
parching
kumquat
like
citric
acidity
a
dynamic
truly
delicious
brew
of
which
i
enjoyed
every
ml
superb
enough
in
drinkability
i
could
easily
go
for
1500
ml
my
willpower
caved
in
i
was
planning
on
aging
this
its
a
tough
life
this
was
my
first
oude
geuze
and
i
think
i
started
off
on
the
right
page
this
is
a
marvelous
beer
drinkability
world
class
beer
an
outstanding
example
of
a
gueze
simply
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
very
drinkable
good
1995
bottle
samped
at
drie
fonteinen
in
2001
probably
my
favorite
gueuze
appearence
big
rocky
head
orange
color
vigorous
carbonation
slight
cloudiness
aroma
balanced
tartly
refreshing
hint
of
nuttiness
flavor
subtle
exciting
sharp
and
nutty
finish
sharp
nutty
quenching
finish
the
taste
mouth
puckering
in
its
sour
tartness
and
yet
so
lovely
to
the
palate
as
the
palate
adjust
it
becomes
deeper
and
richer
than
just
the
tart
nature
there
is
real
body
and
earthiness
here
the
feel
starts
as
if
a
bit
thin
but
then
adds
in
its
champaignlike
overtones
and
the
feel
begins
to
move
beyond
acidity
to
a
higher
level
of
complexity
drinkable
only
in
small
wellsavored
portions
this
is
not
to
be
taken
lightly
nor
casually
after
i
had
ordered
the
gueuze
the
waitress
went
to
the
bar
and
requested
a
one
the
barkeep
then
pulled
out
the
traditional
bottle
of
lambic
lying
at
a
15degree
angle
in
a
wicker
basket
the
bottle
was
carefully
opened
and
poured
without
disturbing
the
yeast
the
beer
when
it
was
set
down
in
front
of
me
displayed
a
lively
carbonation
a
gold
color
slightly
hazy
and
a
thick
creamy
head
even
from
a
distance
the
aroma
was
evident
displaying
notes
of
fruit
including
citrus
when
brought
closer
for
an
extended
sniff
it
smelled
quite
sour
with
an
evident
brett
character
the
taste
was
just
about
perfect
it
was
not
as
sour
as
oud
beersels
gueuze
and
was
incredibly
complex
with
notes
of
wood
mustiness
a
slight
bitterness
and
almost
a
hint
of
what
i
can
only
describe
as
wild
mushroom
this
was
definitely
the
best
gueuze
i
had
ever
had
this
beer
has
a
golden
hue
that
glows
orange
a
very
healthy
and
slightly
bubbly
white
head
tops
it
off
retention
amazing
streams
of
carbonation
jet
to
the
surface
the
aroma
is
wonderful
musty
lemony
grassy
citric
horse
blanket
just
a
little
bubblegum
damn
fine
the
body
is
light
and
the
mouthfeel
is
airy
a
little
fizzy
this
taste
can
be
likened
to
the
outer
layer
a
sour
gobstopper
it
is
acidic
beyond
belief
citrus
flavors
and
lemongrass
make
their
presence
know
some
cider
on
scale
of
110
this
would
get
a
9
maybe
9
5
for
its
mouthpuckering
ability
tart
as
all
get
out
just
a
little
of
the
horseblanket
on
the
buds
just
what
youd
expect
from
a
well
made
lambic
gueuze
the
ne
plus
ultra
de
lambic
indeed
unforgiving
unapologetic
this
beer
is
the
one
café
visit
24th
nov
2002
hazy
orange
appearance
you
just
know
its
going
to
be
sour
when
you
take
your
fisrt
smell
very
stinky
earthy
smell
aswell
this
had
a
very
loooooong
flavour
covered
every
part
of
your
tongue
tremendoudly
sour
tart
acidity
one
of
my
favourite
gueuzes
lemony
grassy
earthy
dry
if
your
a
fan
of
gueuze
you
must
seek
this
out
smell
of
apple
vinegar
some
pale
malts
taste
is
rather
acidic
commonly
bleak
and
malty
abit
of
apples
and
pears
dry
and
winy
mouthfeel
low
carbonation
boring
lambic
it
goes
a
bit
too
fast
from
sour
to
sweet
and
back
again
and
has
some
bad
malty
notes
otherwise
decent
for
its
price
drinks
belgian
but
tastes
like
a
bottle
shop
owner
has
hung
onto
it
a
bit
too
much
decent
but
a
bit
too
stale
compared
with
how
it
should
taste
not
as
intense
and
bright
as
some
beers
in
this
genre
but
not
a
bad
version
the
pour
is
really
flat
like
a
glass
of
chardonnay
with
no
head
or
visible
carbonation
at
all
and
a
shiny
white
grape
color
the
nose
is
sour
indeed
not
so
puckery
or
bacterial
but
fruity
and
tart
again
like
a
wine
the
taste
is
pretty
relaxed
actually
and
this
beer
is
not
nearly
as
complex
and
layered
ad
the
usual
gueuze
if
there
is
such
a
thing
its
sour
but
dry
too
a
little
sleepy
the
feel
kills
it
for
me
the
light
body
is
fine
but
there
is
literally
zero
carbonation
happening
its
like
a
glass
of
flat
pear
cider
or
something
only
sour
the
rouge
is
a
splendid
beer
this
one
not
so
much
when
considered
on
the
whole
cool
to
try
it
on
tap
at
the
monk
on
colfax
though
but
i
wont
pay
9
bucks
for
one
of
these
ever
again
a
drinkable
and
refreshing
beer
however
it
is
actually
a
lager
blended
with
a
blend
of
old
lambics
this
is
an
oddball
beer
like
the
del
borgo
duchessic
which
is
a
blend
of
saison
and
lambics
this
is
definitely
a
novelty
beeri
can
only
wonder
why
someone
would
add
lambic
to
a
lager
like
any
lager
i
could
drink
a
pint
of
it
on
a
warm
day
and
the
lambic
adds
an
interesting
sour
taste
poured
a
hazy
golden
brown
with
a
quickly
receding
white
head
slightly
sweet
aroma
with
some
tartness
in
the
background
a
sour
beer
to
the
tongue
surely
yet
on
the
thin
side
grainy
and
nectar
sweetness
coming
through
much
too
lightbodied
for
this
style
somewhat
acrid
aftertaste
and
not
what
id
call
a
very
drinkable
beer
approach
with
caution
this
has
a
much
better
flavor
than
the
aroma
suggested
in
fact
the
aroma
was
distracting
enough
that
it
took
me
a
while
to
realize
the
flavor
wasnt
complete
bunk
this
is
still
a
poor
example
of
a
gueuze
brouwerij
bockor
makes
a
fantastic
textbook
flander
red
ale
but
this
attempt
at
a
gueuze
is
just
sad
it
was
not
an
enjoyable
beer
and
i
had
it
overlooking
antwerps
beautiful
main
square
alongside
some
delicious
cheese
croquettes
so
thats
got
to
tell
you
something
indeed
this
wouldnt
be
at
all
memorable
were
it
not
for
where
i
had
it
and
how
disappointed
i
was
with
it
this
brew
poured
all
but
no
head
what
little
head
it
had
was
made
up
of
large
clear
bubbles
it
has
a
transparent
amber
body
with
some
bubbles
clinging
to
the
side
of
the
mug
i
that
an
aroma
of
apple
juice
with
a
flat
taste
that
contains
some
tartness
not
a
really
good
brew
but
not
a
drain
pour
either
i
would
not
buy
it
again
clear
with
no
head
looks
quite
a
bit
like
filtered
apple
juice
somewhat
thin
mouthfeel
with
little
carbonation
very
sweet
aroma
and
flavor
with
some
notes
of
fruit
not
very
impressed
by
this
one
especially
considering
the
cost
about
4
for
an
8oz
bottle
a
sweeter
gueuze
and
i
suspect
sweetened
very
sweet
nose
but
has
a
bit
of
earthiness
and
tartness
but
it
was
a
bit
too
sweet
on
the
palate
i
think
this
is
obviously
targeted
at
a
wider
audience
not
for
hardcore
beer
fans
but
theres
enough
in
there
to
make
it
ok
slight
sour
tart
flavour
but
as
i
said
too
sweet
notes
lacks
complexity
and
depth
that
the
usual
gueuze
expresses
this
beer
did
not
move
me
in
anyway
would
pair
beautifully
with
cheese
ive
had
this
before
in
a
bottle
and
it
sucked
this
evening
on
draft
it
was
amazing
quite
sour
with
wonderful
flavor
pricey
but
def
worth
trying
overall
an
interesting
beer
quite
tasty
but
i
prefer
my
gueuze
without
the
robust
hopping
a
powerful
blasting
sour
one
i
think
i
can
hardly
find
some
other
that
has
an
overall
balance
so
exiciting
simply
love
it
glad
i
took
a
risk
on
this
one
thumbs
up
tart
and
citrusy
a
hint
of
skunked
hops
dry
oaky
aftertaste
pretty
acidic
taste
seems
slightly
funky
something
about
it
seems
out
of
place
however
likely
the
green
bottle
skunkiness
it
was
pretty
good
but
i
wouldnt
get
it
again
unless
it
was
fresh
seems
more
like
a
wild
ale
than
anything
overall
as
a
fan
of
mikkeller
i
was
expecting
nothing
but
the
best
but
this
collaboration
with
to
øl
had
surpassed
any
and
all
expectations
i
had
before
trying
this
in
short
get
this
if
you
can
youll
not
regret
it
my
gosh
this
is
probably
the
best
geuze
ive
had
yet
finally
one
thats
properly
arbonated
and
doesnt
just
taste
feel
like
cheese
water
haha
yup
a
great
one
no
big
surprise
there
these
two
breweries
know
what
theyre
doing
375
ml
bottle
served
in
a
tulip
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
goldenorange
color
with
about
an
inch
offwhite
head
head
retention
and
lacing
are
both
decent
enough
the
brew
smells
like
oak
green
apple
lemon
zest
hay
and
some
citrusyfloral
hops
it
tastes
like
oak
funk
green
apple
hay
bready
malt
white
grapes
peaches
and
some
pear
this
tastes
better
the
longer
i
drink
this
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
it
has
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
and
its
easy
to
drink
i
liked
this
brew
a
lot
although
its
pricey
at
14
99
a
bottle
definitely
worth
a
try
o
interesting
long
list
dry
hops
used
had
me
expecting
more
floral
and
fruit
but
the
sourness
and
oakymust
stood
out
probably
should
have
opened
this
sooner
rather
than
holding
on
to
it
as
long
as
i
did
enjoyed
overall
this
was
disappointingly
not
very
sour
interesting
beer
and
worth
a
try
but
not
great
overall
a
very
decent
brew
like
i
said
i
wish
i
had
know
aforehand
i
would
have
saved
it
a
tad
loner
to
go
with
my
temptation
2009
vs
temptation
2013
vs
petrus
vs
some
bruery
tart
competition
but
oh
well
i
just
wasnt
expecting
a
sour
this
evening
can
definitely
taste
the
hops
too
light
and
fluffy
i
very
much
like
this
not
a
fan
of
mikkeller
maybe
i
need
to
learn
more
about
the
concept
but
i
like
this
o
its
not
terrible
which
is
a
pleasant
surprise
i
usually
hate
anything
by
mikkeller
this
is
quite
drinkable
albeit
not
terrific
that
said
its
no
saintgilloise
which
is
the
premier
dryhopped
lambic
o
it
was
a
slightly
aboveaverage
geuze
i
cannot
say
that
i
would
go
out
and
seek
it
again
but
it
is
definitely
worth
a
try
if
you
happen
to
see
a
bottle
or
on
tap
somewhere
i
dont
know
if
there
is
betel
nutleaf
in
it
as
the
name
suggests
but
it
has
been
over
10
years
since
i
tried
betel
so
i
forgot
how
it
tastes
it
was
the
firstlast
time
perhaps
the
bitterness
was
not
from
citrus
peel
but
rather
from
the
betel
nut
pours
a
light
yelloworange
gold
color
with
a
small
to
medium
offwhite
head
kinda
fizzy
the
beer
is
somewhat
cloudy
though
i
did
have
the
bottle
on
its
side
until
about
half
hour
before
opening
it
i
cant
say
that
i
really
care
about
clarity
in
beer
though
no
lacing
no
bubbles
at
all
after
a
couple
minutes
its
a
sour
what
do
you
want
the
aroma
is
quite
interesting
big
sour
apples
oak
and
lemons
shot
through
with
tropical
fruit
peaches
grapes
tangerines
and
some
floral
hoppiness
its
not
an
aroma
that
id
immediately
peg
as
hoppy
but
it
makes
sense
upon
reflection
it
smells
like
the
sweet
aromatic
side
of
the
hops
with
very
little
of
the
danker
resinous
notes
solid
mix
of
sweet
and
sour
and
definitely
not
something
that
ive
smelled
before
the
taste
is
more
sour
forward
theres
some
light
peachgrapepineappletangerine
action
in
the
finish
but
its
mostly
a
very
nice
lambicish
sour
on
the
tongue
good
pucker
tastes
like
a
version
of
spontannoble
without
the
magical
sauternes
barrels
depth
and
complexity
still
this
is
better
than
lots
of
highly
touted
sours
the
5
5
abv
lets
the
bright
complex
sourness
shine
theres
some
wonderful
musty
funk
in
the
mix
the
sourness
is
lambicish
in
its
complexity
this
is
no
onenote
lactic
or
acetic
bomb
very
dry
as
the
beer
warms
more
of
the
hop
flavor
comes
out
in
the
taste
it
adds
a
very
pleasant
element
to
the
beer
floral
peaches
and
tropical
tangerines
meet
those
baby
gueuze
flavors
the
mouthfeel
is
light
medium
to
mediumstrong
pucker
this
isnt
quite
as
good
as
spotannoble
but
it
reminds
me
of
that
beer
considerably
more
breweries
need
to
brew
lambicstyle
sours
under
6
abv
though
i
imagine
it
requires
a
rather
sure
hand
a
solid
gueuze
but
the
absurd
list
of
hopsdryhopping
really
dont
do
anything
here
lacks
some
character
lets
see
what
some
agin
does
this
is
a
great
sour
but
ive
had
better
gueuzes
i
always
want
more
sweaty
funky
flavors
and
aromas
out
of
a
gueuze
the
hops
only
come
through
in
aroma
and
flavor
not
much
bitterness
which
is
an
awesome
way
to
do
it
considering
the
style
i
love
that
i
dont
get
any
clove
or
banana
this
is
a
totally
different
belgian
in
that
sense
its
a
great
sour
with
many
nuances
id
get
it
in
a
bottle
if
it
was
priced
well
overall
pleasant
complex
and
kind
of
weird
worth
a
try
oh
thats
a
complex
beer
difficult
to
detail
really
nice
though
i
would
love
to
try
this
again
and
definitely
will
be
looking
for
more
bottles
moving
forward
o
i
dont
have
a
wide
gueuze
background
but
this
really
nice
lemon
hay
funk
oak
brett
sour
complex
balanced
and
pleasant
but
tons
going
on
particularly
in
the
aroma
luckily
i
have
a
few
more
bottles
to
sit
on
poured
a
gorgeous
cloudy
golden
colored
body
with
a
fluffy
quarter
finger
white
head
that
receded
to
ring
of
white
leaving
little
lacing
effervescent
bubbles
can
be
seen
in
the
glass
quite
nice
looking
and
very
true
to
style
scents
of

of
green
apple
raspberry
layered
with
earthy
yeasty
funk
hay
honey
a
touch
of
oak
and
mild
grapefruit
and
lemon
aromas
overall
impression
is
of
a
nicely
acidic
and
sour
funky
geuze
that
is
still
balanced
with
fruit
and
honey
aromas
that
provide
depth
a
very
nice
example
of
the
styles
aroma
taste
begins
moderately
sour
with
flavors
of

and
a

hints
of

is

in

with
notes
of

aftertaste
is
grapefruit
lemon
wheat

and
sour
earthy
funk
overall
impression
is
of
a
moderately
sour
and
acidic
flavor
profile
with
balancing
fruit
oak
and
honey
flavors
contributing
depth
a
very
nice
example
of
a
geuze
flavor
profile
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
and
effervescent
with
a
semidrying
puckering
acidic
feel
very
nice
and
quite
true
to
style
overall
this
is
a
nice
example
of
a
geuze
it
is
sour
and
acidic
in
aroma
and
flavor
yet
balances
these
qualities
with
other
notes
as
well
this
is
aided
by
the
mouthfeel
which
is
light
and
spritzy
but
not
watery
a
very
nice
geuze
and
well
worth
trying
overall
this
is
a
nice
and
mild
gueuze
with
plenty
of
complexity
i
would
put
this
into
the
same
caliber
as
a
3f
gueuze
which
is
my
favorite
standard
gueuze
i
would
say
that
i
like
this
slightly
more
than
cantillion
classic
because
the
funk
profile
of
girardin
gueuze
is
much
better
suited
to
my
tastes
it
is
much
more
well
rounded
and
balanced
than
cantillion
classic
gueuze

light

like
my

whoah
some

dry

some

as

here
more
chewy
body
than
other
gueuzes
in
the
class
that
ive
had
and
low
plus
carbonation
nice
brew
overall
and
a
bit
of
a
changeup
from
the
lp
gueuze
earlier
in
the
night
recommended
pours
a
pretty
clear
light
gold
body
with
spidery
lacing
stretching
out
very
tart
aroma
but
surprisingly
refreshing
flavor
is
dry
and
tart
bit
of
sweet
vinegar
rustic
and
some
herbs
around
the
edges
quite
nice
the
thing
l
love
about
lambics
is
their
variability
and
this
is
further
proof
of
the
highly
distinguishable
differences
among
the
standards
like
boon
3f
cantillon
tilquin
hansenns
etc
this
to
me
lies
just
behind
3f
mariage
parfait
and
cantillon
classic
as
far
as
best
standard
gueuzes
go
rustic
fruity
dry
quaffable

excellent
beer
fans
of
bretts
will
really
love
this
one
it
is
funky
weird
sour
but
ultimately
delicious
and
satisfying
i
was
joking
with
my
wife
that
if
i
had
brewed
this
and
was
trying
for
an
ale
or
something
and
then
it
tasted
like
a
gueuze
i
might
pour
it
all
out
and
start
over
however
once
you
have
become
acquainted
with
this
style
and
the
brett
taste
in
general
i
think
you
will
become
a
lifelong
fan
and
take
it
as
a
blessing
if
the
brett
fairy
ever
visits
a
fermenter
of
your
homebrew
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
any
and
all
overall
a
good
gueuze
though
not
one
of
my
favorites
its
worth
a
try
but
there
are
better
gueuze
options
out
there
overall
very
nice
shelf
geueze
good
complexity
and
a
bit
of
funk
would
like
more
funk
but
this
is
not
too
far
from
tilquin
in
my
opinion
overall
really
good
beer
and
pretty
much
deserving
of
its
ranking
it
does
retail
about
the
same
as
those
three
other
gueuzes
i
keep
mentioning
so
i
would
probably
grab
one
of
those
over
this
beer
tilquin
is
pretty
much
always
available
definitely
worth
a
try
even
for
someone
who
has
difficulty
with
sours
an
interesting
and
refreshing
beer
prost
overall
tasty
and
infinitely
drinkable
wonderful
stuff
d
nice
and
nippy
without
being
overbearing
overall
this
is
a
classic
example
of
the
gueuze
i
was
lucky
enough
to
try
some
cantillon
beers
on
tap
at
russian
river
last
weekend
and
this
is
making
me
want
more
belgian
lambics
and
gueuzes
job
well
done
overall
this
an
upper
echelon
gueuze
average
sourness
but
the
flavor
is
top
notch
very
much
recommended
d
awesome
drink
none
of
the
flavors
are
overpowering
smooth
i
highly
recommend
to
everyone
who
wants
to
get
into
gueuze
style
beers
pours
a
apple
cider
color
with
a
minimal
amount
of
haziness
smell
is
green
apples
and
lemons
with
a
decent
amount
of
funkiness
taste
is
moderately
tart
with
some
of
the
apple
and
lemon
and
is
fairly
dry
medium
amount
of
carbonation
overall
it
very
enjoyable
and
very
good
especially
at
price
around
10
very
very
nice
gueuze
here
whats
more
is
that
you
can
typically
pick
this
stuff
up
off
the
shelf
too
at
least
you
should
be
able
to
it
seems
like
most
places
near
me
dont
carry
it
anymore
but
if
you
look
around
you
should
be
able
to
get
it
and
once
you
find
it
i
recommend
buying
as
much
of
it
as
you
can
its
some
truly
delicious
stuff
and
any
lover
of
gueuze
will
certainly
appreciate
this
blend

overall
a
good
gueuze
but
maybe
not
my
favorite
theres
a
metallic
twang
that
works
against
this
beer
bottle
on
new
years
eve
2012
bottle
drunk
after
a
couple
of
top
champagnes
and
i
have
to
say
this
beat
them

outstanding

overall
very
good
but
i
am
sure
it
gets
better
with
some
age
look
forward
to
trying
it
again
in
some
time
anyway
still
a
really
nice
gueuze
at
this
stage
m
lighter
side
of
medium
t
starts
a
touch
sweet
almost
like
a
lemon
hard
candy
then
hits
with
a
good
punch
of
sourness
funk
and
vinegar
finish
brings
some
vanilla
lemon
curd
and
green
apple
the
flavors
are
really
well
balanced
and
despite
the
smell
this
is
far
less
funky
than
a
lot
of
gueuzes
out
there
really
tasty
stuff
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
golden
yellowamber
with
a
thin
loose
white
head
that
dissipates
down
into
a
white
halo
without
lacing
there
appears
to
be
ample
carbonation
without
much
visible
sediment
the
nose
is
mildly
sour
nonskunky
with
a
very
slight
fruitiness
reminiscent
of
tart
cherries
the
taste
is
just
as
mild
mannered
and
drinkable
as
the
nose
packing
in
an
initial
malty
grainy
sweetness
some
backend
funk
and
finishes
with
a
semidry
tart
bitterness
this
is
certainly
one
of
the
most
drinkable
gueuzes
ive
had
and
im
liking
how
approachable
and
balanced
this
is
compared
to
some
of
the
funkbomb
gueuzes
im
used
to
drinking
its
mouthfeel
is
initially
sweet
well
carbonated
slightly
funky
and
bitter
in
the
finish
as
the
beer
warms
it
packs
in
a
bit
more
bitterness
in
the
finish
which
contributes
to
the
beers
crisp
refreshing
mouthfeel
im
impressed
with
this
10375ml
shelfgueuze
over
hanssens
and
tilquin
alternatives
and
due
to
its
superior
drinkability
however
im
not
sure
ill
try
too
hard
to
acquire
more
bottles
i
e
trade
for
more
if
it
were
available
in
my
area
id
gladly
indulge
the
beer
pours
a
dark
and
hazy
copper
color
with
golden
yellow
highlights
the
beer
pours
with
a
quarterofafingerswidth
creamy
white
head
of
tiny
compact
bubbles
and
is
replenished
by
a
steady
stream
of
bubbles
coming
from
throughout
the
glass
the
beers
body
is
a
cloudy
haze
of
proteins
and
such
and
the
other
side
of
the
glass
can
only
just
barely
be
seen
on
the
nose
the
beer
smells
properly
barnyardy
with
touches
of
cherry
fruit
leather
and
salt
the
funk
is
nice
and
dominant
in
the
nose
and
provides
a
nice
spiced
feeling
to
the
nose
perhaps
briefly
suggesting
peppers
beneath
the
salty
funk
lies
a
nice
citric
smell
somewhere
between
lemons
and
grapefruits
with
a
touch
of
pineapple
thrown
in
on
the
tongue
the
beer
tastes
sweet
up
front
and
then
quickly
dries
into
bitter
and
savory
flavors
with
a
medium
strength
acidity
washing
through
the
mouth
in
flavor
the
beer
begins
as
salty
fruity
almost
like
a
pineapple
the
fruit
flavors
grow
in
the
mouth
and
introduce
barnyard
cherry
fruit
leather
and
some
nice
herbal
grassy
flavors
in
the
finish
and
aftertaste
the
finish
moves
towards
a
funky
lemon
flavor
and
has
a
nice
long
length
the
lemon
lasts
into
the
aftertaste
blending
with
the
grassy
herbal
flavors
to
leave
a
pleasant
taste
in
the
mouth
in
the
mouth
the
beer
feels
on
the
light
side
of
medium
in
body
and
crisp
with
a
nice
snappy
and
rough
carbonation
that
scrubs
the
tongue
free
of
any
of
the
more
cloying
funk
flavors
the
mouth
is
left
clean
except
for
a
nice
pool
of
acid
neutralizing
saliva
overall
this
is
a
great
gueuze
with
proper
depth
and
complexity
if
anything
i
would
call
it
a
bit
subdued
in
flavor
though
it
has
all
of
the
right
components
but
is
too
muted
the
grassy
bitters
are
also
a
little
too
strong
and
hold
back
some
of
the
other
flavors
in
the
beer
this
beer
is
a
nice
solid
gueuze
overall
though
and
definitely
worthy
of
a
try
o
i
wanted
to
rate
this
one
higher
but
the
lack
of
carbonation
made
me
take
points
off
the
mouthfeel
although
i
felt
it
was
otherwise
nicely
balanced
and
the
flavor
was
also
complex
and
wellbalanced
but
the
aftertaste
kind
of
ruined
it
i
had
to
eat
a
slice
of
havarti
cheese
to
tone
down
the
intensity
which
i
highly
recommend
because
it
was
a
nice
pairing
o
easily
the
best
gueuze
ive
had
yet
although
my
pool
of
experience
is
admittedly
still
quite
shallow
before
this
one
i
didnt
really
see
what
all
the
hype
around
sours
and
gueuzes
was
all
about
now
i
really
want
to
explore
the
landscape
a
lot
more
a
very
enjoyable
and
horizonbroadening
experience
o
despite
being
very
light
this
is
still
quite
a
very
tasty
and
sour
gueuze
i
would
like
to
taste
one
that
has
been
aged
for
awhile
to
see
if
it
developes
more
but
with
the
low
alcohol
content
i
would
not
expect
a
whole
lot
that
being
said
this
beer
is
definitely
worth
a
try
and
could
be
a
great
starter
sour
o
nicely
balanced
gueuze
but
its
not
quite
as
tasty
as
drie
fonteinen
now
thats
a
gueuze
damn
this
is
yummy
it
pours
a
pale
straw
color
hazy
but
i
wouldnt
call
it
cloudy
as
the
yeast
sediment
is
very
fine
rather
than
coagulated
floaties
just
a
half
inch
of
white
lace
on
top
the
nose
is
real
sour
lemon
rind
and
champagne
assault
the
nostrils
very
acidic
very
unique
the
flavor
isnt
nearly
as
pucker
as
the
nose
until
the
finish
that
is
when
the
sour
just
expands
and
takes
over
the
mouth
it
starts
more
malty
wheaty
farmy
oaky
chardonnay
and
orchard
fruit
the
sour
slowly
eases
in
amping
up
to
a
very
intense
degree
by
the
time
the
beer
is
swallowed
the
sour
and
the
acid
leave
the
tastebuds
in
a
blissful
state
of
ruin
dont
follow
this
beer
with
anything
you
want
to
taste
nuances
in
trust
me
light

heavily

ive
been

and
i
think
this
is
up
there
with
some
of

in
the
field

is

a
wonderful
gueuze
im
currently
drinking
a
fresh
bottle
and
its
comparable
to
any
of
the
vaunted
examples
of
the
style
pours
a
yellowish
orange
with
small
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
hazy
the
aroma
is
subtle
and
complex
there
are
notes
of
green
apples
lemons
barnyard
funk
hay
sourdough
sour
cherries
and
grass
the
taste
still
has
some
light
malt
sweetness
but
it
finishes
light
dry
and
medium
sour
the
aftertaste
is
sour
and
funky
its
a
very
easy
beer
to
drink
but
youll
want
to
savor
it
delicious
super
enjoyable
gueuze
nicely
balanced
between
sour
and
funk
very
tasty
indeed
a
bit
pricey
even
for
a
gueuze
but
its
worth
a
try
overall
this
one
was
pretty
rough
going
far
too
much
sewage
and
mouldy
musty
dank
dewllings
on
this
one
not
my
style
of
gueuze
whatsoever
choked
down
three
ounces
and
dumped
the
rest
a
nice
change
from
the
lambics
i
normally
choose
though
more
of
a
niche
offering
to
my
palate
i
prefer
a
faro
or
a
framboise
to
be
honest
overall
this
was
a
super
solid
gueuze
but
not
amazing
or
mind
blowing
not
a
style
i
seek
out
but
i
can
appreciate
when
the
flavor
profile
is
stellar
and
really
has
that
pop
worth
while
to
seek
out
for
fans
of
ths
style
for
sure
o
off
in
the
color
department
but
interesting
in
its
own
right
very
good
gueuze
the
color
on
this
one
makes
it
jump
out
apart
from
the
others
in
the
tasting
otherwise
it
is
competitive
with
all
of
them
o
very
drinkable
extremely
smooth
and
easy
drinking
gueuze
in
the
same
level
of
a
drie
fonteinen
or
a
cantillon
mandatory
to
wild
beer
lovers
oi
have
limited
gueuze
experience
but
this
beer
was
a
real
pleasure
complex
drinkable
and
pleasing
with
a
great
mixture
of
fruit
yeast
funk
and
body
that
left
me
wanting
to
drink
more
o
an
absolute
delight
to
drink
one
im
so
glad
i
got
to
have
and
one
i
would
gladly
buy
in
quantity
o
well
done
gueuze
it
up
their
as
a
top
in
the
style
right
behind
3fcantillion
would
buy
this
any
time
i
see
it
overall
an
excellent
showing
of
my
favorate
style
and
ive
got
a
few
to
save
fantastic
this
has
matured
nicely
since
i
got
my
mitts
on
it
sour
dry
and
fruity
delicious
good
balance
the
acidity
isnt
overpowering
and
the
taste
is
clean
and
bright
a
musttry
lambic
grab
one
and
age
it
for
a
while
o
okay
but
not
great
needs
some
age
o
a
good
entry
gueuze
this
exhibits
all
the
standards
things
youd
find
but
isnt
to
sour
or
funky
o
overall
very
good
as
i
said
above
not
as
puckeringly
sour
as
i
remember
and
that
level
of
sour
was
what
i
was
hoping
for
but
very
good
nonetheless
glad
i
was
able
to
get
ahold
of
a
bottle
from
one
of
the
reportedly
only
7
cases
to
hit
the
entire
state
of
sc
not
sure
if
its
true
but
thats
the
rumor
i
heard
definitely
worth
seeking
out
overall
this
is
very
enjoyable
perhaps
not
as
good
as
some
but
definitely
a
high
quality
gueuze
none
the
less
375ml
2011
this
gueuze
pours
a
medium
bodied
hazy
sunset
orange
in
color
with
a
soapy
and
bright
white
one
finger
head
the
nose
is
mellow
and
citrusy
it
smells
more
like
a
fantome
saison
than
most
gueuze
out
there
its
strange
for
a
gueuze
to
lack
acidity
like
this
does
but
it
has
a
great
nose
nonetheless
uh
oh
this
is
über
sessionable
the
flavors
are
light
and
citrusy
there
is
a
lot
of
freshly
squeezed
orange
plenty
of
rhind
and
light
acidic
tartness
it
drinks
perfectly
the
funk
levels
in
this
one
are
minimal
this
drinks
perfectly
for
the
style
it
is
light
and
very
smooth
the
drinkability
on
this
one
is
through
the
roof
i
could
drink
this
by
the
liter
this
instantly
jumps
into
my
top
few
gueuze
status
great
beer
pours
a
cloudy
pale
yellow
with
a
two
and
half
pillowy
white
head

with

accents
on

an
opening
salvo
of
tartness
fills
the

luscious
citrus
and
other

tones
sourdoughlike
yeasty
esters
and
funk
dominate
the
midpalate
finishes
tart
and
dry
perfect

smooth
and
clean

this
gueze
reaches
a
level
most
others
fall
well
short
of
among
the
very
best
overall
i
havent
had
much
experience
with
this
style
of
beer
but
it
seemed
to
be
more
complex
tasting
than
some
of
the
others
gueuzes
ive
had
it
wasnt
simply
just
a
blast
of
citricvinegar
it
had
subtle
nuances
to
it
very
good
stuff
thanks
again
phyl21ca
d
sort
of
a
dark
horse
that
i
really
knew
nothing
of
beforehand
i
like
the
lightness
of
the
funk
with
the
cleanliness
of
the
drink
makes
for
something
easily
drinkable
for
just
one
person
o
a
pretty
damn
good
gueuze
very
tasty
and
incredibly
drinkable
pours
a
murky
orange
with
a
beige
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
no
lacing
on
this
one
smell
is
sour
tart
and
funky
with
some
lemonlike
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
some
sour
apple
peel
flavors
there
is
an
acidic
finish
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
very
good
gueuze
with
some
great
aromas
and
flavors
o
this
is
an
incredibly
refreshing
gueuze
with
tons
of
character
and
complexity
it
does
a
great
job
balancing
palate
numbing
tartness
with
a
bit
of
funk
oquality
beer
that
i
would
buy
more
of
good
presentation
of
the
style
to
a
buddy
of
mine
that
shared
this
beer
with
me
overall
im
a
fan
of
this
beer
i
would
have
been
alright
if
the
tart
levels
were
a
tad
higher
but
i
still
enjoyed
it
o
a
nice
gueuze
was
pleasantly
surprised
when
it
was
revealed
that
this
was
1882
would
certainly
get
this
again
o
awesome
beer
i
will
look
for
an
older
one
o
very
enjoyable
and
refreshing
in
a
funky
sort
of
way
i
really
found
this
one
to
be
easy
to
drink
and
definitely
one
to
enjoy
again
a
different
take
on
the
gueuze
style
that
id
happily
give
a
small
role
in
my
regular
rotation
excellent
gueuze
it
has
made
me
forgive
its
less
than
dry
finish
and
less
than
desired
funk
with
a
brisk
tartness
and
bold
taste
i
recommend
it
enjoy
o
one
of
the
best
of
my
favorite
style
medium
to
mediumlight
bodied
with
perfectly
suited
moderately
noticeable
carbonation
that
generates
a
rather
smooth
and
flowing
mouthfeel
finish
is
quite
dry
my
first
nonamerican
wild
cork
says
2011
pours
a
bright
orange
with
a
touch
of
pink
thick
fluffy
white
head
that
recedes
to
a
solid
ring
smell
is
definite
brett
funk
woody
musty
moldy
but
in
a
clean
way
if
that
makes
sense
i
also
get
an
aroma
like
that
of
the
closet
that
holds
the
bin
that
holds
my
daughters
diapers
not
in
a
bad
way
but
kind
of
in
the
way
that
you
like
to
smell
your
own
fart
some
bright
citric
fruits
behind
the
funk
lemon
lime
sour
apple
taste
is
sour
but
not
overpoweringly
so
a
nice
soft
lactic
sourness
which
is
starting
to
turn
a
bit
more
acetic
as
it
warms
up
just
a
touch
of
bitterness
to
balance
it
out
the
funk
on
the
palate
is
somewhat
subdued
as
compared
to
the
nose
but
it
is
still
good
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
refreshing
exactly
what
i
would
expect
overall
this
is
a
complex
brew
that
evolves
in
the
glass
nothing
absolutely
blows
my
mind
but
a
great
beer
worth
seeking
out
and
not
too
difficult
to
find
kiddwhiz
highly
recommended
this
brew
cork

2011
poured
to

the
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
rich
golden
color
with
orange
edges
in
the
light
nice
big
2
5
finger
slightly
offwhite
head
with
excellent
retention
and
lacing
looks
very
good
the
aroma
is
a
mix
of
a
mild
sour
note
with
a
pleasant
malty
sweetness
underneath
hints
of
fruit
apples
as
well
the
flavor
presents
itself
with
a
more
acidic
note
than
anticipated
based
on
the
nose
mildly
bitter
with
some
biscuitymalt
character
compliments
the
slight
citrus
sour
flavor
mouthfeel
is
lighter
and
crisp
overall
this
is
a
very
good
gueze
i
appreciate
that
the
sour
doesnt
just
dominate
your
face
instead
its
presence
really
presents
itself
well
enjoyed
and
recommended
this
is
my
new
favorite
gueuze
it
is
perfectly
balanced
with
the
citrus
funk
and
sourness
all
in
balance
while
i
tend
to
like
extremely
funky
brews
it
is
nice
to
experience
a
good
balance
a
top
notch
brew
o
not
my
favorite
gueuze
but
still
very
good
just
not
enough
sweetness
in
flavor
and
too
much
funk
again
i
feel
a
little
ashamed
that
i
walk
by
these
all
the
time
in
the
search
for
something
new
and
exotic
in
terms
of
gueuzes
this
is
excellent
and
certainly
one
of
the
top
few
beers
regularly
on
shelf
here
will
not
be
passing
by
this
as
frequently
mvery
nice
mouthfeel
with
a
lot
of
drinkability
except
may
be
a
bit
sour
to
drink
more
than
one
nice
creamy
head
cork
on
the
bottle
says
2011
so
i
think
this
is
a
2009
bottle
pours
into
the
glass
a
clear
rust
orange
color
with
a
fluffy
white
head
aroma
is
farm
year
mineral
horse
sweat
peach
not
all
that
funky
and
has
a
touch
of
something
sweet
in
there
but
very
crisp
and
refined
the
flavor
follows
the
aroma
peach
fruits
pears
not
a
lot
of
citrus
a
hint
of
sweet
almost
vanilla
flavor
and
of
course
alot
of
horsey
farmy
sour
minerals
this
one
is
really
nice
but
not
as
good
as
the
drei
fonteinen
to
me
i
have
noticed
minor
variations
over
the
yearsvintages
this
review
is
for
the
batch
that
has
2012
on
the
cork
pours
a
light
amber
with
a
white
head
that
pops
and
fizzes
but
actually
gets
some
decent
life
before
shrinking
to
a
collar
leaves
a
little
lace
as
well
nose
is
divine
citrus
pith
and
wood
stand
out
most
to
me
but
there
is
a
heavy
undercurrent
of
funk
and
something
like
a
live
mineral
static
thing
going
on
as
well
it
just
jumps
in
to
my
senses
awesome
taste
is
crisp
clean
defined
and
sour
not
crazy
sour
medium
body
that
is
slick
and
almost
prickly
at
the
same
time
clean
refreshing
finish
just
a
beautiful
beer
that
has
its
own
personality
more
of
a
reserved
character
than
some
of
its
counterparts
but
somehow
seems
more
classy
winner
every
time
the
reveal
gueuze
girardin
1882
black
label
this
is
about
spot
on
from
the
last
time
i
had
this
beer
thanks
alewatcher
i
am
glad
to
have
tried
this
beer
blind
and
it
is
neat
that
my
assessment
is
about
the
same
this
seems
like
one
micah
helped
provide
intel
on
overall
supremely
confusing
very
dynamic
flavor
that
is
largely
foreign
hints
of
unpopped
popcorn
kernels
and
mold
very
alive
or
very
dead
tasting
dr
the
flavours
may
not
be
horribly
complex
but
theyre
spot
on
for
what
theyre
trying
to
do
very
nicely
constructed
with
the
style
in
mind
any
fan
of
the
style
should
try
this
not
the
best
gueuze
ive
had
but
a
pretty
good
one
in
short
a
good
gueuze
thats
not
overly
souracidic
reminding
me
of
berliner
weisse
this
poured
out
as
a
clear
yellowish
gold
color
without
much
head
on
top
at
all
it
looks
pretty
flat
actually
more
like
a
white
wine
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
funky
very
strong
on
the
nose
of
wild
fermentation
the
taste
was
tart
and
dry
much
like
most
gueuze
lambics
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
not
highly
caronated
at
all
and
quite
dry
overall
its
getting
a
little
easier
for
me
to
drink
these
brews
but
theyre
still
not
my
cup
of
tea
really
i
cant
say
id
order
it
again
but
im
happy
to
have
at
least
tried
it
big
thanks
goes
out
to
the
ba
dont
have
spreadsheet
in
front
of
me
who
traded
this
one
with
me
inperson
a
long
time
back
2005
vintage
served
from
bottle
into
a
mikkeller
taster
flute
poured
a
hazy
golden
yellow
with
a
half
finger
pure
white
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
quickly
maintained
very
minimal
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
sour
apples
vinegar
funk
earth
and
subtle
tart
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
big
funk
earth
tart
and
very
subtle
fruit
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
mediumhigh
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
good
brew
i
was
really
happy
with
how
well
this
one
held
up
with
time
the
funk
was
quite
forward
but
not
in
an
invasive
way
a
really
well
done
brew
that
i
plan
to
buy
many
more
of
for
my
cellar
i
suggest
you
do
the
same
i
can
see
where
they
were
aiming
and
they
hit
it
they
went
for
straight
barnyard
funk
and
sour
apple
vinegar
it
could
improve
with
a
little
bit
more
lasting
flavors
and
a
touch
of
cirtic
tartness
but
i
nit
pick
one
hell
of
a
beer
and
a
good
replacement
if
cantillon
or
drie
fonteinen
isnt
around
o
as
an
american
hop
head
this
is
the
kind
of
beer
i
never
thought
id
be
seeking
out
but
once
you
get
a
taste
of
a
good
sour
your
life
will
change
every
sip
is
to
be
cherished
with
a
beer
this
good
o
i
am
learning
to
love
this
style
and
this
is
one
of
the
better
examples
it
has
a
very
nice
fruity
character
and
the
funk
isnt
overpowering
awesome
stuff
great
funk
and
fruit
both
displaying
balance
an
outstanding
gueuze
for
the
availability
on
par
or
maybe
even
exceeding
drie
fonteinen
a
very
good
gueuze
with
a
particularly
great
aroma
though
ive
had
much
better
tasting
ones
within
the
style
o
this
beer
is
really
quite
funky
it
is
sweet
for
a
gueuze
but
balanced
by
significant
sourness
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
overall
a
terrific
beer
well
deserving
of
its
high
rating
this
isnt
the
best
gueuze
ive
had
but
was
still
fun
to
try
looked
very
appealing
nice
bright
copper
color
smell
was
pleasantly
funky
and
sour
it
started
off
nice
and
sour
with
lots
of
lemon
and
apples
but
the
finish
was
rather
sweet
for
my
liking
very
champagne
like
in
finish
and
mouthfeel
interesting
beer
not
my
favorite
gueuze
drinkability
this
is
a
nice
gueuze
one
of
the
better
tart
beers
ive
had
overall
a
quintessential
example
of
its
style
the
girardin
gueuze
1882
is
an
experience
not
to
be
missed
intense
to
the
unaccustomed
but
a
worthwhile
endeavor
for
the
connoisseur
treat
yourself
to
a
bottle
and
discover
a
piece
of
beer
folklore
overall
im
pegging
this
one
down
in
the
overall
because
its
very
tartcentric
i
craved
some
horse
blanket
and
was
somewhat
let
down
i
do
think
that
it
accentuates
the
flavors
it
has
so
well
though
that
its
still
an
excellent
beer
i
found
myself
increasing
the
ratings
as
i
drank
the
beer
and
wrote
this
review
o
i
love
this
stuff
it
has
a
very
good
tartness
to
it
but
its
not
over
bearing
like
a
lot
of
american
wilds
so
the
heart
burn
doesnt
kick
in
after
every
sip
if
you
like
sours
this
is
a
must
try
classic
example
dry
brown
ales
will
always
hold
a
special
place
in
my
heart
but
damn
this
might
be
my
new
goto
dink
goes
great
with
food
particularly
salads
or
stirfries
and
works
well
as
a
refreshing
beverage
on
its
own
cheers
i
dont
have
much
experience
in
gueuzes
and
after
the
smell
was
a
bit
worried
but
the
tartness
more
than
balanced
out
the
funk
and
it
ended
up
being
a
very
enjoyable
beer
o
id
definitely
recommend
this
as
a
beer
with
food
by
itself
the
finish
is
a
bit
too
much
however
together
with
food
its
delightful
and
palate
cleansing
id
grab
this
again
if
i
had
a
chance

dig
the
balance
on
the
nose
additionally
the
flavor
profile
is
really
satisfying
man
i
wish
this
genre
were
more
accessible
and
less
expensive
overall
the
sour
comes
out
swinging
then
falls
off
fairly
quick
this
is
great
but
i
can
only
imagine
what
few
years
would
do
to
this
by
rounding
itself
out
and
probably
drying
out
more
going
to
have
to
grab
a
handful
for
the
cellar
o
very
nice
gueuze
drink
here
its
a
good
sour
to
have
as
it
isnt
overly
sour
easier
to
drink
i
think
thanks
for
sharing
scott
glad
i
got
to
try
this
o
believe
this
is
the
first
geuze
i
have
had
and
right
now
its
not
really
my
thing
probably
scored
lower
due
to
personal
taste
rather
than
the
actual
quality
of
the
beer
i
am
a
big
fan
of
sours
and
lambiks
but
this
just
didnt
do
much
for
me
although
i
will
revisit
the
style
again
i
am
sure
o
solid
gueuze
not
the
best
that
i
have
had
but
very
delicious
and
refreshing
none
the
less
o
a
wonderful
gueuze
not
as
soft
or
as
complex
a
3f
but
im
enjoying
the
aggressive
sourness
immensely
at
the
price
it
will
be
hard
to
purchase
as
frequently
as
other
gueuzes
but
if
you
have
not
had
this
you
must
seek
it
out
very
very
good
all
so
supple
and
melded
and
tasting
more
balanced
and
mellow
than
many
others
gorgeous
o
much
better
than
the
first
in
this
style
that
i
had
not
as
funky
as
a
taste
much
mellower
allows
you
to
really
taste
the
fruity
sourness
appearance
4
aroma
4
taste
4
mouthfeel
5
overall
4
amazing
balance
it
retains
the
lambic
sourness
but
in
such
a
good
way
that
it
is
now
one
of
the
benchmarks
i
have
to
go
off
of
i
wish
i
could
find
this
a
lot
more
often
when
i
find
it
again
though
i
have
dibs
on
a
case
spectacular
sour
balance
even
with
the
sourness
being
completely
over
the
top
among
my
favourite
beers
ever
md
creamy
texture
and
dry
i
could
drink
it
everyday
o
not
the
best
gueze
ive
had
this
is
a
fresh
bottle
so
i
may
grab
another
bottle
to
sit
on
for
a
year
or
so
overall
a
great
and
widely
available
geuze
beer
d
really
solid
gueze
here
lots
of
citrusy
mouth
puckering
sourness
but
not
over
the
top
with
it
good
balance
between
the
funk
and
the
sour
i
am
going
to
have
to
seek
some
more
of
these
out
and
lay
them
down
overall
its
fine
but
is
probably
not
one
of
my
favorites
for
this
style
doesnt
seem
as
big
a
fruit
profile
and
missing
some
of
the
real
arid
dry
character
i
like
drinkable
for
what
it
is
ill
give
it
that
for
sure
it
would
be
neat
to
do
a
side
by
side
comparison
with
some
others
but
i
just
am
not
feeling
this
one
as
much
and
thats
being
totally
honest
with
myself
not
feeling
it
overall
gueuze
favorite
beer
style
yes
well
assuming
all
the
beers
are
this
good
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
it
is
most
certainly
a
beer
i
will
have
again
pours
a
hazed
golden
amber
active
head
with
good
retention
and
lacing
scent
dominated
by
the
funkyness
and
sourness
from
the
brett
earthy
damp
wood
and
mud
fresh
dried
grain
malt
profile
taste
follows
scent
put
together
nicely
a
mild
blend
compared
to
some
others
in
the
style
the
brett
never
over
powers
the
palate
and
it
doesnt
become
puckering
quite
refreshing
lighter
side
of
medium
bodied
bone
dry
a
nice
gueuze
that
doesnt
push
any
of
the
strong
notes
over
the
top
overall
very
nice
a
solid
gueuze
for
the
price
and
even
more
so
considering
the
fact
its
on
shelves
this
is
a
nice
gueuze
the
initial
flavor
is
a
nice
sour
fruit
and
it
erupts
into
a
deep
bitter
finish
the
reveal
girardin
gueuze
1882
black
label
awesome
i
definitely
read
about
this
one
being
a
classic
example
of
a
gueuze
but
havent
seen
it
anywhere
around
me
really
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
thanks
a
ton
khaz
overall
not
the
best
but
one
of
the
better
gueuzes
out
there
pleasant
sourness
and
mostly
a
great
example
of
the
style
lacking
in
effervescence
and
lack
of
head
formationretention
are
points
for
improvement
flavor
and
aroma
could
use
additional
complexity
but
this
is
one
still
one
to
be
savored
taste
is
tart
and
sharp
very
crisp
and
clean
and
much
less
funky
and
horse
blankety
than
the
likes
of
anything
3f
mouthfeel
is
light
and
smooth
with
a
good
bitter
sour
bite
that
really
rounds
it
out
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
but
this
did
not
disappoint
o
when
i
cant
find
cantillon
classic
geuze
i
go
for
black
label
and
it
never
dissapoints
its
sour
and
tart
without
overwhelming
but
is
still
a
beast
in
its
own
right
overall
its
good
but
the
taste
is
nothing
special
d
really
nice
ive
been
waiting
to
try
this
bad
boy
forever
and
finally
decided
to
seize
the
day
and
crack
this
one
open
wonderful
refreshing
stellar
gueuze
this
is
amongst
the
best
that
ive
had
i
would
gladly
drink
this
again
o
i
now
understand
the
love
for
this
brew
this
is
readily
available
in
downtown
dc
and
i
plan
on
getting
a
few
more
bottles
o
all
the
components
are
there
for
a
great
gueuze
and
with
a
few
years
on
it
this
baby
will
really
shine
i
wonder
who
i
know
has
a
few
bottles
from
around
2005
the
generosity
of
beerwolf77
never
ends
the
girardin
gueuze
was
ultimately
the
more
pleasant
of
the
two
it
begins
dry
and
sweet
crisp
with
a
great
refreshment
both
from
the
light
gravity
and
the
awesome
effervescence
the
close
and
the
aftertaste
however
are
a
total
upheaval
of
everything
you
notice
at
the
beginning
a
yeasty
throat
drying
ripple
grows
from
the
back
of
your
mouth
and
makes
you
feel
like
your
throat
is
the
culture
for
the
brewers
next
batch
ive
never
used
medicinal
in
a
positive
way
but
its
a
useful
way
to
describe
such
a
unique
drying
sensation
this
particular
beer
was
pretty
costly
at
12
for
a
300ml
bottle
all
the
same
it
was
an
awesome
first
for
the
style
and
an
awesome
beer
overall
would
love
to
try
this
both
a
day
after
and
a
few
years
after
bottling
this
beer
showcases
a
nice
medium
straw
yellow
nice
white
head
formation
and
thin
lacing
excellent
and
intriguing
smell
lots
of
citric
fruits
oranges
lemon
and
lime
distinct
pepper
and
bready
yeast
as
well
taste
is
very
tart
focusing
on
lemon
and
lime
sourness
with
grapes
and
pear
there
is
a
slight
biscuity
quality
mixed
in
with
the
yeast
slight
candy
sweetness
that
is
mainly
muted
by
the
sour
crisp
and
light
feel
to
it
overall
a
nice
gueuze
and
i
will
be
definitely
drinking
more
of
these
whenever
i
can
get
it
o
this
is
a
great
gueuze
and
clearly
a
stand
out
for
the
style
up
against
the
excellent
briney
oysters
this
was
a
pairing
made
in
heaven

with
a
slight

mouthwatering
with
a
zingy

solid
gueuze
we
did
this
on
a
gueuze
tasting
night
and
this
one
came

this

super
tasty
brew
md
very
well
balanced
a
great
looking

i
was
expecting
a
little
more
sourness
on
the
tongue
great
smooth
gueuze
drink
the
tart
acidity
and
sweet
strike
a
good
balance
gueuzes
are
really
starting
to
grow
on
me
after
having
a
few
of
the
top
in
style
i
will
be
sure
to
come
back
to
this
one
1882
black
label
is
quite
simply
a
spectacular
world
class
beer
buy
it
drink
it
go
to
bed
happy
girardin
gueuze
pops
out
with
a
straw
yellow
look
with
some
slight
faded
bronze
in
color
a
stealth
pour
yeilded
a
small
white
cap
eventually
nothing
no
lace
im
liking
the
nose
on
this
smelling
like
a
typical
gueuze
but
more
well
rounded
not
so
much
dank
basement
more
of
a
mix
between
musk
hay
and
some
fruit
taste
blew
me
away
first
sips
were
marvelous
a
nice
hit
of
sour
apple
with
some
barnyard
notes
lime
and
some
earthy
hops
in
the
fresh
bottle
quite
sour
on
the
tounge
and
swishing
it
around
makes
for
best
results
the
sour
stays
a
bit
than
fades
the
feel
is
light
bodied
and
the
carb
is
spritzy
i
like
this
gueuze
a
winner
in
my
eyes
d
a
well
balanced
sour
only
5
refreshing
easy
to
drink
d
i
cant
imagine
a
traditional
sour
being
any
easier
to
drink
normally
refreshing
isnt
a
term
id
use
to
describe
a
sour
but
this
actually
was
surprisingly
refreshing
overall
this
is
a
really
good
beer
but
i
dont
think
its
good
enough
to
purchase
at
the
current
price
point
dvery
drinkable
d
delicious
id
put
this
on
par
with
supplication
a
reminder
to
myself
about
how
good
it
was
not
a
note
on
similarity
which
i
managed
to
forget
since
the
sour
tasting
i
do
recall
this
doing
surprisingly
well
at
the
tasting
very
drinkable
would
prefer
this
in
the
summertime
good
thirst
quencher
love
me
some
sours
you
may
not
think
so
but
this
is
an
awesome
beer
for
food
pairing
particular
dishes
can
really
bring
out
a
whole
other
side
to
the
gueuze
and
viseversa
try
it
with
caprese
for
instance
the
creaminess
and
milky
flavor
of
the
fresh
mozzarella
will
play
well
with
the
acidity
and
sour
tang
of
the
beer
also
the
tomatoes
and
basil
share
similar
flavors
with
the
beer
mussels
and
fries
grilled
vegetables
and
richly
sauced
cuts
of
meat
will
be
nice
pairings
too
as
for
cheese
try
girardin
gueuze
with
delice
de
bourgogne
this
is
a
triplecream
cows
milk
cheese
from
the
burgundy
region
of
france
the
creaminess
will
go
well
with
the
sour
acidity
of
the
beer
much
like
how
an
acidic
wine
can
cut
through
the
fat
of
a
creamy
cheese
d
its
a
nicely
drinkable
sour
beer
with
a
good
flavor
but
the
carbonation
is
a
little
low
for
this
style
i
feel
otherwise
a
very
nice
gueuze
it
is
an
interesting
one
i
have
an
older
vintage
in
the
cellar
which
i
will
give
a
long
age
and
then
try
this
one
again
dvery
pleasing
and
highly
drinkable
compared
to
my
other
experience
with
gueuze
i
was
not
expecting
the
level
of
bitterness
though
but
its
not
a
negative
characteristic
for
me
the
drinkability
is
off
the
charts
i
highly
reccomend
this
beer
for
both
gueuze
fans
and
newcomers
to
the
style
easily
one
of
my
new
favorites
d
moderately
high
this
is
a
very
tasty
gueuze
very
lemony
d
i
love
gueuzes
and
this
fine
beverage
measures
up
to
the
style
in
magnificent
fashion
cheers
pours
a
hazy
golden
yellow
with
some
pure
white
foam
that
settles
into
a
nice
ring
the
smell
is
not
particularly
strong
and
is
definitely
focused
more
on
the
musty
chalky
minerally
funky
at
times
cheesy
aspects
as
opposed
to
straight
in
your
face
acidity
slight
amounts
of
green
apple
and
lemon
poking
through
but
not
fruit
forward
the
taste
brings
more
tartness
into
the
profile
while
maintaining
a
really
good
funky
mustiness
definite
mineral
component
reminiscent
of
wet
stone
light
acedic
acid
definitely
not
overpowering
more
cider
like
has
almost
a
yeasty
taste
that
i
associate
with
saisons
mild
underripe
green
fruitiness
thats
slightly
bitter
almost
a
stemlike
or
peel
quality
instead
of
a
fleshy
burst
of
flavor
mouthfeel
is
a
little
flat
for
me
but
this
beer
is
insanely
drinkable
i
could
drink
liters
of
it
very
refreshing
and
complex
enough
to
keep
it
interesting
but
not
overpoweringly
sour
this
bottle
went
quite
quickly
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
the
head
is
big
and
foamy
white
the
color
is
a
dull
golden
very
hazy
and
lots
of
carbonation
rising
to
the
top
lacing
is
strong
the
aroma
is
fruity
grassy
and
old
back
of
the
closet
dust
the
taste
is
tart
throughout
hits
the
back
of
the
tongue
and
makes
you
tweek
a
bit
fresh
yogurt
comes
to
mind
not
as
tart
as
some
cantillons
i
have
had
but
strong
the
body
is
light
but
with
heavy
carbonation
it
made
me
feel
fuller
a
great
example
to
enjoy
a
bottle
at
a
time
d
excellent
drinkablity
this
is
right
in
my
comfort
zone
an
exceptional
gueuze
ill
continue
to
seek
this
out
whenever
i
can
pours
an
almost
clear
golden
with
a
small
persistent
head
bubbles
continuously
flowing
up
from
the
bottom
of
the
tulip
glass
nice
looking
beer
smell
is
full
of
dusty
funk
brett
and
tartness
taste
is
very
bright
and
citrusy
lemons
and
sour
apples
a
good
amount
of
lactic
sour
without
a
lot
of
acetic
character
excellent
lambic
mouthfeel
is
lively
slightly
puckering
and
finishes
dry
taking
style
into
account
on
drinkability
this
one
goes
down
pretty
easy
its
sour
but
not
ripping
my
mouth
apart
so
i
could
drink
it
easily
but
a
lambic
of
this
quality
should
be
enjoyed
over
a
good
amount
of
time
overall
an
excellent
gueuze
that
is
easy
to
get
a
hold
of
d
highly
drinkable
this
beer
is
really
creamy
great
amount
of
carbonation
i
think
i
need
to
go
buy
some
mussels
and
fries
certainly
one
of
the
best
gueze
still
being
produced
conclusion
i
think
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
tasted
truly
exceptional
in
almost
every
way
what
an
interesting
style
of
beer
this
is
i
feel
you
could
drink
it
for
years
and
still
not
fully
comprehend
the
flavors
and
aromas
something
that
cannot
be
said
for
most
american
styles
of
beer
it
is
one
of
my
goals
as
a
home
brewer
to
brew
something
that
is
akin
to
this
style
this
was
good
great
flavor
i
cannot
wait
to
see
what
my
other
bottle
does
with
some
time
on
it
the
cpj
d
well
this
is
as
drinkable
as
it
gets
for
my
money
wonderful
in
every
category
if
i
had
ready
access
to
this
beer
i
would
swear
off
all
other
beers
and
drink
this
exclusively
d
really
great
example
of
what
a
gueuze
should
be
seems
like
it
would
be
a
great
introduction
to
the
style
fr
anyone
just
getting
into
sour
ales
will
seek
this
one
out
again
to
see
what
some
age
does
to
it

raising
my
rating
for
this
thanks
to
a
couple
bottles
at
our
lambic
tasting
over
the
weekend
no
notes
on
this
but
each
bottle
was
exceedingly
better
than
my
virgin
bottle
nice
lemon
funk
sour
and
dry
flavors
very
expressive
and
balanced
good
stuff
one
of
the
best
standard
geuzes
from
what
we
enjoyed
d
simply
put
there
need
to
be
more
5
beers
that
taste
like
this
the
tastes
seem
to
slowly
become
less
and
less
special
as
the
beer
goes
on
but
they
still
taste
wonderful
i
think
ill
always
be
able
to
buy
this
beer
and
enjoy
it
at
any
time
i
really
hope
i
get
this
beer
again
as
well
as
explore
more
in
to
the
style

that
diminishes
quickly
very
loud
bubbling
as
well
scent
extremely
funky
and
sour
i
definitely
get
a
farmhousehorse
blanket
aroma
from
this
particular
beer
i
also
pick
up
cheese
aromas
and
lemon
very
interesting
and
delightful
smelling
beer
taste
is
super
sour
i
love
it
initially
i
get
funky
yeast
flavors
followed
by
lemon
and
cheese
notes
the
mouthpuckering
sourness
doesnt
stop
the
amazing
flavors
from
coming
through
this
beer
some
grassy
notes
as
well
mouthfeel
is
very
dry
and
very
crisp
fullbodied
and
puckering
drinkability
is
high
for
me
on
this
one
ive
realized
that
im
really
becoming
a
huge
fan
of
lambics
wild
ales
and
gueuzes
this
is
an
outstanding
beer
this
is
probably
the
most
sour
beer
ive
tried
excellent
gueuze
d
this
is
a
bit
too
sour
for
me
i
enjoy
sours
but
this
one
is
a
bit
too
onesided
not
very
balanced
in
my
opinion
the
low
abv
makes
it
drinkable
but
i
think
i
will
finish
this
one
and
not
need
to
buy
another
for
a
while
the
finish
is
bone
dry
as
it
should
be
accompanied
by
a
lively
spritzy
body
the
feel
is
phenomenal
the
sourness
is
intense
and
shocks
the
palate
a
bit
extremely
easy
to
drink
refreshing
and
satisfying
this
is
a
really
good
beer
that
i
will
definitely
be
revisiting
d
very
easy
to
drink
i
wish
it
was
cheaper
so
i
could
buy
more
this
really
stands
out
as
the
best
gueuze
i
have
had
what
i
really
love
about
this
beer
is
the
perfect
balance
between
sour
and
funk
in
my
opinion
drinkability
a
fantastic
sour
ale
will
drink
again
d
a
standard
for
the
style
for
sure
my
bottle
is
extremely
fresh
so
i
can
only
see
this
getting
better
over
time
a
smooth
example
without
being
a
palate
melting
sour
bomb
ridiculously
drinkable
drinkability
one
and
done
but
very
enjoyable
to
have
with
some
gouda
cheese
will
definitely
pick
up
another
one
or
two
to
cellar
d
i
sampled
this
at
the
wine
shop
today
and
was
disappointed
doesnt
compare
to
drie
fonteinen
hannsens
or
cantillon
if
i
had
paid
to
drink
this
i
would
have
regretted
it
there
is
a
strange
smell
that
goes
with
this
beer
i
cant
define
it
pretty
sour
taste
or
better
said
much
too
sour
i
am
cured
for
a
while
d
low
alcohol
but
this
is
a
sipper
a
golden
hazy
pour
with
a
bit
of
head
tart
and
funky
smell
that
has
both
sour
and
funk
characteristics
tastes
like
a
nice
balance
between
the
two
definitely
sour
but
complex
and
funky
well
carbonated
a
smooth
sippable
beer
that
i
would
definitely
drink
again
a
personal
favorite
freaking
love
this
beer
a
remarkably
flavorful
gueuze
but
without
the
heartburn
that
accompanies
some
of
its
more
acidic
brethren
more
than
deserving
of
its
lofty
ba
ranking
a
rare
beer
that
is
both
refreshing
and
complex
love
the
gueuze
this
would
go
awesome
with
some
sharp
cheeses
and
old
funky
meats
i
liked
this
one
a
lot
absurdly
effervecent
beer
the
tight
head
never
let
down
the
whole
time
i
sipped
this
beer
some
clinging
spotty
lacing
nice
hazy
amber
gold
color
pungent
aroma
of
lemon
brett
the
wet
hay
varity
pinapple
and
oak
lots
of
citrus
up
front
and
through
the
mid
palate
oaky
with
some
good
sourness
but
not
lippuckering
rather
a
dry
experiance
i
pick
up
a
tad
of
tobacco
more
oak
plenty
of
tart
apple
underlying
wheat
flavor
is
pie
crust
like
the
mouthfeel
is
zingy
and
lively
this
geuze
dances
over
the
tongue
oh
yeah
i
could
have
plenty
of
these
a
very
good
pretty
well
balanced
gueuze
db
a
well
rounded
lambic
on
the
easy
and
drinkable
side
of
things
not
too
sour
or
funky
but
a
lot
of
good
fruit
and
yeast
influence
going
on
d
very
tasty
and
drinkable
great
balance
of
sourness
and
flavor
an
all
around
excellent
gueuze
definitely
a
great
gueuze
complex
easy
to
drink
lots
of
flavors
coming
out
a
good
balance
with
nothing
really
taking
over
anything
else
i
will
definitely
hunt
down
a
couple
more
of
these
i
can
understand
why
this
is
better
than
most
gueuzes
and
ill
rate
it
as
such
but
this
style
is
not
for
me
5
0
d
definitely
a
solid
gueuze
this
is
definitely
there
to
help
you
get
a
sour
fix
well
balanced
flavor
profile
great
taste
and
everything
else
is
pleasant
by
the
end
of
the
bottle
i
wanted
more
poured
a
moderately
cloudy
ambertan
like
apple
cider
lemony
aroma
first
sip
is
a
jawclenching
tartness
of
lemon
juice
and
green
apple
once
the
initial
shock
wears
off
tart
white
wine
and
fresh
oak
notes
emerge
tartness
moderates
well
throughout
with
a
bit
of
barnyard
funkyness
at
the
end
toward
the
very
end
some
overripe
almost
spoiled
orchard
fruit
notes
march
past
d
i
think
this
bottle
is
not
as
the
brewer
intended
to
be
seeing
as
how
there
is
no
carbonation
and
previous
reviews
and
the
style
would
suggest
there
should
be
much
more
bottle
pours
a
slighlty
hazy
amber
orange
color
with
a
light
wispy
head
sour
tart
aroma
with
slight
acetone
notes
some
funky
barnyard
notes
as
well
with
lemon
zest
tart
slightly
mouthpuckering
oh
yeah
this
is
tasty
tart
grape
flavors
light
mouthfeel
some
lingering
barnyard
funkiness
at
the
end
overall
a
very
very
tasty
beer
light
yet
powerful
so
surprised
by
the
5
d
awesome
drinkability
this
one
is
quite
sour
and
very
dry
a
pleasant
experience
but
one
glass
is
enough
while
it
certainly
didnt
fall
short
of
my
expectations
im
not
sure
if
im
willing
to
say
its
the
best
gueuze
ive
had
just
yet
absolutely
worth
trying
and
clearly
a
shining
example
of
the
style
that
cannot
be
missed
overall
a
very
good
gueze
lots
of
great
flavors
and
i
wish
this
one
was
around
mn
very
drinkable
for
how
sour
it
is
d
unlike
a
lot
of
really
tartsour
beers
this
actually
gets
more
drinkable
as
you
go
as
the
sourness
kind
of
fades
as
it
sits
out
very
good
beer
overall
probably
the
best
gueze
i
have
ever
had
balanced
flavorful
and
perfectly
blended
while
still
managing
to
be
crisp
and
refreshing
delicious
and
complex
highly
recommended
d
holly
cow
this
one
was
fun
super
refreshing
and
a
welcome
wake
up
for
my
taste
buds
i
could
easily
drink
this
beer
again
and
again
pours
a
cloudy
dark
honey
color
no
head
astringent
smell
of
oak
sweet
tarts
and
the
dying
remnants
of
malt
sweetness
after
a
few
sips
to
acclimatize
my
palate
to
the
bracing
sour
pucker
i
detect
a
flavor
profile
that
while
not
the
best
does
the
trick
oaky
tannins
souir
grape
lactic
citric
acid
with
a
slight
tannic
pucker
at
the
very
back
of
the
tongue
after
the
liquid
passes
through
this
is
quite
dry
yet
leaves
the
mouth
watering
for
another
sip
the
tannic
back
bite
reminds
me
of
when
you
eat
the
strongly
bitter
pith
of
a
citrus
fruit
minus
the
bittersweet
reward
of
the
sweet
fruit
i
wish
there
was
more
opening
up
in
this
glass
but
almost
sadly
not
almost
because
this
is
a
satisfying
drink
while
still
remaining
on
the
periphery
of
what
i
am
seeking
out
in
it
notes
very
good
gueuze
not
quite
as
sourtart
as
others
but
it
still
showcases
those
flavors
overall
a
very
good
beer
that
could
be
a
good
introduction
into
sours
for
someone
the
carbonation
was
zippy
and
tight
the
body
was
medium
but
never
heavy
so
easy
to
drink
d
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
for
the
style
and
the
complexity
of
the
sour
flavors
will
bring
me
back
to
having
another
one
of
these
in
the
future
this
gueuze
is
quite
drinkable
and
has
a
decent
amount
of
sour
but
not
overwhelming
oak
comes
through
nicely
a
refreshing
gueuze
but
lacking
a
little
bit
in
the
complexity
department
however
with
a
couple
years
of
age
this
could
turn
into
an
excellent
beer
looks
like
ill
be
picking
up
a
few
more
for
the
cellar
worth
checking
out
if
you
like
the
style
this
one
certainly
lived
up
to
the
hype
good
stuff
bottle
thanks
to
probstk
massive
gusher
half
my
living
room
floor
is
coated
with
gueuze
apple
and
peach
aromas
beautiful
gueuze
aromas
taste
is
a
beautiful
balance
of
moderate
sourness
and
natural
sweetness
lots
of
apples
and
tropical
fruits
very
good
gueuze
i
prefer
this
one
over
the
cantillons
shared
this
with
some
friends
over
the
weekend
lots
of
funk
in
the
aroma
almost
horseshit
like
but
i
wouldnt
have
it
any
other
way
there
was
some
tart
fruit
aromas
as
well
the
taste
was
sour
and
tart
like
green
apples
im
not
very
familiar
with
gueuzes
but
this
met
my
expectations
d
this
is
all
just
one
note
sour
just
overwhelming
and
not
pleasant
to
drink
for
me
maybe
i
am
not
a
gueuze
fan
d
it
seems
that
every
time
i
try
one
of
the
classic
belgian
examples
of
this
style
i
am
impressed
at
least
in
my
area
these
are
not
at
all
rare
very
easy
to
get
i
find
myself
wondering
why
i
ever
spend
time
and
effort
to
get
some
of
the
rarer
american
versions
of
the
style
that
seem
to
cost
an
arm
and
a
leg
in
trade
granted
they
are
good
but
with
fine
examples
of
the
style
like
this
readily
available
it
doesnt
make
sense
this
is
truly
an
amazing
gueuze
one
that
i
will
certainly
have
again
and
again
d
light
enough
to
be
refreshing
complex
enough
to
be
interesting
perhaps
the
perfect
summer
beer
for
the
beer
geek
looks
good
two
fingers
of
head
clear
straw
colored
body
just
a
solid
looking
beer
that
looks
like
youd
expect
but
whats
awesome
is
even
from
a
foot
away
looking
at
it
the
aroma
reaches
out
and
grabs
you
and
pulls
you
in
just
forces
you
closer
not
as
funky
as
expected
but
its
there
along
with
some
lemon
and
sourdough
the
flavors
seem
kinda
thin
while
it
is
a
really
dry
beer
i
would
hope
for
more
of
a
fullness
but
all
the
flavors
are
attractive
and
inticing
mosty
a
huge
amount
of
lemons
leading
the
way
but
some
funky
wet
straw
a
light
vinegarette
and
green
apple
the
mouthfeel
is
very
good
its
overall
quite
a
dry
beer
but
not
at
all
bitting
and
bitter
until
the
end
it
doesnt
start
off
right
away
you
have
to
wait
for
it
only
knock
is
i
would
like
just
a
bit
more
carbination
pours
a
dark
but
clearish
gold
with
huge
head
from
intense
carbonation
and
dies
very
slow
a
powerfully
tart
and
funky
aroma
greets
my
nose
with
hints
of
tart
cherry
or
grape
as
well
as
applle
or
pear
sourness
is
strong
as
well
real
smooth
and
creamy
medium
body
surprised
me
as
there
is
a
nice
mild
sweet
fruit
taste
along
with
sour
tart
fruit
tastes
such
as
grape
apple
passes
slick
but
there
is
a
a
slight
woodiness
to
this
beer
one
expects
from
this
style
and
the
finish
is
very
crisp
and
pleasant
thanks
to
the
carbonation
a
very
very
good
sipper
great
drinkability
for
the
style
nothing
offensive
or
off
about
this
one
that
makes
you
hesitate
to
grab
another
mouthful
d
a
pretty
good
gueuze
this
beer
is
very
funky
and
tarty
and
if
you
like
that
youll
probably
like
this
beer
a
lot
would
have
again
wow
this
is
definitely
a
solid
top
candidate
gueuze
loads
of
funkiness
and
tart
just
like
it
should
be
very
smooth
somewhat
late
fruit
notes
medium
body
atleast
for
a
gueuze
the
oak
and
wood
aspect
is
perfect
well
rounded
nice
carbonation
and
a
great

idea
how
to
read
the
dating
but
there
was
a
2010
on
the
cork
poured
a
semitranslucent
tawny
orangegold
with
a
rocky
two
inch
bright
white
head
that
slowly
receded
leaving
cloudlike
strands
of
lacing
as
it
dissipated
into
a
thin
fairly
consistent

wonderful

a
hint
of

followed
by
some
green

skins
a
suggestion
of
grapefruit

a
faint

quality
the
smell
alone
has
started
my
salivary
glands
taste
follows
nose
however
the
grapefruit
and
acidity
really
comes
out
and
masks
the
green
apple
suggested
by
the
nose
some
cork
and
wood
expresses
itself
at
the
finish
moutfeel
is
light
with
a
carbonation
level
that
falls
just
short
of
sparkling
acidity
lightly
stimulates
the
salivary
glands
along
the
cheeks
and
finishes
semidry
a
delicious
and
refreshing
beer
on
a
warm
humid
day
not
as
sour
as
some
gueuzes
that
ive
tried
however
delicious
and
extremely
easydrinking
glad
i
finally
got
the
opportunity
to
try
this
5055deg
fluted
glass
holly
crap
this
is
good
stuff
this
is
a
must
for
all
the
sour
heads
out
there
though
this
is
incredibly
complex
as
well
just
amazing
a
world
class
beer
get
it
if
you
see
it
probably
the
most
drinkable
sample
of
the
style
i
have
had
d
love
my
sour
beers
and
this
is
no
exception
great
offering
from
the
girardin
brewery
md
mouthfeel
is
good
light
and
tart
without
slapping
the
tongue
this
is
a
very
drinkable
gueuze
that
is
a
credit
to
its
style
pours
a
cloudy
golden
with
about
an
inch
of
head
there
is
lots
of
sediment
visible
around
the
base
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
faintly
citrusy
with
a
huge
amount
of
funk
the
taste
is
incredibly
sour
while
refreshing
at
the
same
time
the
taste
is
almost
the
equivalent
of
taking
a
shot
of
tequila
and
then
chasing
it
with
a
half
and
half
mixture
of
lime
juice
and
mountain
dew
its
actually
a
very
pleasant
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
light
good
carbonation
extremely
dry
and
puckering
finish
keeps
me
coming
back
for
more
what
an
amazingly
drinkable
and
easily
accessible
sour
i
will
be
revisiting
this
one
more
than
a
few
times
over
the
hot
summer
months
drinkability
well
a
great
gueuze
brings
you
back
in
with
each
sip
though
a
sessionable
beer
this
is
not
despite
the
low
abv
a
beer
to
be
slowly
sipped
and
enjoyed
d
this
was
quite
fantastic
im
getting
into
lambic
more
and
9
for
this
bottle
was
a
worthwhile
purchase
but
i
think
id
stick
with
cantillon
classic
in
the
future
ill
have
to
get
it
again
soon
and
remind
myself
what
the
difference
is
dthis
is
very
tasty
but
it
is
so
tart
and
sour
the
flavors
are
very
good
and
blend
together
very
nicely
nothing
is
too
strong
to
keep
a
nice
complex
balance
d
the
only
thing
preventing
me
from
drinking
more
of
this
is
the
price
10
for
a
375ml
bottle
and
the
danger
of
sour
stomach
this
is
a
wonderful
gueuze
that
is
highly
overlooked
or
as
overlooked
as
a
top
100
beer
can
be
due
to
its
relatively
wide
availability
a
lot
of
the
rare
beers
that
are
drooled
over
arent
nearly
as
good
as
this
stuff
drinkability
was
by
no
means
something
to
significantly
mark
down
on
but
it
felt
heavier
in
my
stomach
than
other
gueuzes
or
sours
with
a
similar
pretty
low
abv
d
this
is
an
awesome
gueze
the
sourness
is
there
and
its
pretty
big
but
its
kept
in
check
by
the
complexity
and
other
characters
in
the
brew
wonderfully
put
together
and
a
great
beer
overall
green
bottle
with
a
cork
ref
cx2010
opens
with
a
loud
pop
and
fizz
pours
a
light
orange
color
with
a
white
head
that
receeds
to
a
thin
lace
on
top
of
the
beer
with
spotty
lacing
left
on
the
glass
nose
is
both
funky
and
tart
with
musty
yeasty
notes
and
some
citrus
zip
in
the
back
of
the
aroma
taste
includes
some
puckering
tartness
upfront
that
blends
through
a
very
lemonlike
citrusy
body
that
finishes
sour
as
it
warms
there
are
more
notes
of
mustiness
and
funk
faint
lingerting
taste
of
subtle
fruit
almost
like
apricots
blended
in
with
the
funk
and
tartness
light
body
with
moderate
carbonation
very
drinkable
as
my
mouth
salivates
to
take
the
next
sip
the
tartness
of
this
gueze
is
potent
enough
to
burn
the
back
of
the
nose
and
throat
yet
strangely
smooth
for
a
gueze
very
subtle
earthiness
about
this
that
suggests
oak
without
coming
straight
forward
or
bold
with
the
oak
characteristics
very
good
orangegold
pour
with
a
big
rocky
white
head
loads
of
sour
funk
in
the
aroma
with
some
hints
of
chardonnay
oak
green
apple
lemon
zest
grass
grain
leather
and
a
little
sweetness
that
i
cant
quite
describe
the
acidity
and
sourness
immediately
hits
the
tongue
first
but
then
cherry
strawberry
and
lemon
hints
start
to
develop
the
malt
flavors
are
grassy
dry
grains
again
the
flavor
has
a
little
sweetness
to
it
that
im
not
sure
how
to
describe
medium
body
with
lots
of
carbonation
that
finishes
very
dry
and
clean
this
is
definitely
a
well
crafted
gueuze
and
the
complexity
and
quality
reflect
that
girardin
gueuze
1882
is
basically
the
mac
daddy
of
gueuze
pours
with
a
huge
and
thick
white
head
this
one
is
cloudy
yellowgold
and
as
the
tide
of
foam
recedes
there
is
a
thick
carpet
of
delicate
lace
left
in
its
wake
the
aroma
is
lemony
floral
and
sweet
but
funky
and
sour
at
the
same
time
tastes
lemony
funky
floral
and
rosey
even
light
to
medium
bodied
with
a
full
but
not
quite
bubbly
feel
one
of
the
best
there
are
so
many
sours
one
can
trade
their
proverbial
left
nut
for
but
this
one
is
still
going
to
be
better
than
99
of
them
very
well
carbonated
and
quite
prickly
on
the
tongue
crisp
and
refreshing
while
at
the
same
time
being
quite
astringent
kind
of
an
oxymoron
and
kind
of
confusing
but
enjoyable
all
in
all
ive
concluded
that
it
is
one
of
my
favorite
lambics
to
date
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
brownishorange
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
tartness
with
some
sugar
and
not
much
funk
the
flavor
is
tart
lemon
oak
vanilla
with
some
citrus
and
little
to
no
funk
the
beer
is
very
very
dry
and
very
juicy
tasting
it
finishes
very
tart
lowmedium
carbonation
and
a
thin
mouthfeel
highly
recommended
drinks
really
well
its
not
too
mouth
puckeringly
sour
well
maybe
at
first
it
is
a
bit
but
i
adjusted
pretty
quickly
this
is
a
style
i
need
to
get
into
a
bit
more
im
digging
it
done
of
the
more
drinkable
of
the
unsweetened
gueuzes
i
always
forget
how
world
class
this
beer
is
doesnt
get
the
play
of
a
cantilon
or
dries
fontaine
but
this
should
be
up
there
as
a
top
gueuze
d
really
a
hidden
gem
among
all
the
highly
hyped
and
sought
after
sours
this
humble
little
beer
has
got
to
be
one
of
the
best
of
the
bunch
great
balanced
flavor
with
the
feel
to
pull
it
all
together
i
hope
i
get
to
revisit
this
one
again
and
again
despite
the
nose
which
could
use
a
little
work
this
is
simply
an
exceptional
beer
cheers
overall
an
excelent
example
of
a
gueuze
that
i
was
glad
i
could
find
will
have
to
revisit
cause
i
am
too
blown
away
this
is
the
first
beer
of
this
style
that
i
can
honestly
say
i
have
enjoyed
perhaps
it
is
my
tastes
developing
but
this
beer
needs
to
get
some
credit
for
it
drinkability
is
good
a
well
made
gueuze
with
great
tartness
but
not
my
favorite
d
well
definitely
enjoyed
having
one
375ml
bottle
but
i
dont
think
i
would
want
more
then
that
definitely
a
sipper
for
me
this
is
a
good
beer
when
i
want
a
change
from
any
of
the
mainstream
heavily
consumed
beers
i
gave
a
sip
of
this
beer
to
a
friend
who
has
never
had
a
guezue
and
she
described
it
as
piss
flavored
candy
its
a
great
beer
though
bright
sour
finishes
tart
slightly
dry
but
doesnt
dry
the
mouth
out
a
slight
funk
on
the
backend
medium
to
low
bodied
an
overall
really
good
gueuze
and
a
good
beer
pours
a
hazy
honey
yellow
color
with
white
head
that
fades
to
a
nice
lace
on
top
of
the
brew
ok
lacing
too
smell
is
largely
tart
lemon
peel
some
wood
crisp
green
apple
maybe
a
hint
of
funk
taste
follows
suit
though
adding
in
some
vingegar
notes
sour
apple
and
lemon
zest
dominate
some
yeastiness
too
lots
of
flavor
dry
on
the
finish
but
definitely
causes
the
salivary
glands
to
do
some
work
very
drinkable
a
real
treat
for
sure
375

to

tastes
like

funk
and
a
bit
of
yeast
and
peaches
nice
lingering

mouthfeelbody
is

it
has
good

and
finishes
dry
drinkability
is
good
its
smooth
and
enjoyable
to
drink
overall
i
think
this
is
a
very
good
gueuze
ill
definitely
pick
this
up
again
the
next
time
i
find
a
bottle
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
light
bodied
with
above
average
carbonation
overall
i
dont
have
much
experience
with
sours
yet
but
from
what
i
have
had
of
the
style
this
is
a
very
good
one
it
has
almost
a
candy
like
sweet
tartness
to
it
that
makes
it
very
tasty
and
drinkable
overall
this
is
great
easily
the
best
and
most
drinkable
gueze
out
there
i
drank
this
after
drinking
ddg
earlier
and
i
must
say
theyre
pretty
darn
close
wise
this
is
a
bargain
compared
to
ddg
d
this
is
a
delicious
complex
beverage
that
needs
to
be
experienced
once
of
the
best
lambics
ive
ever
had
d
this
is
very
nice
though
it
is
more
of
a
rare
treat
than
it
is
a
regular
option
d
well
for
a
gueuze
i
suppose
this
is
more
drinkable
than
the
few
others
ive
sampled
i
think
ill
actually
finish
this
bottle
but
i
still
dont
think
id
consider
this
a
pleasant
experience
gueuzes
arent
my
thing
but
i
do
like
to
try
one
ever
so
often
maybe
the
style
is
slightly
growing
on
me
or
maybe
1882
is
a
milder
more
drinkable
brew
in
an
already
challenging
style
d
this
is
the
best
10
gueze
i
think
ive
ever
had
being
relatively
easily
available
i
look
forward
to
returning
to
it
regularly
444

d
highly
drinkable
gueuze
most
are
this
low
in
alcohol
but
some
have
such
high
acidity
that
they
cant
be
handled
in
large
quantities
i
wouldnt
mind
trying
a
large
quantity
of
this
this
one
has
a
nice
pour
a
clear
copper
color
with
a
two
finger
head
that
dissolves
down
to
a
fine
film
that
leaves
a
touch
of
lacing
surprisingly
clear
for
an
unfiltered
brew
nose
is
drying
funky
sourness
up
front
then
some
champagne
lots
of
fruitiness
apricots
crackery
breadiness
if
that
makes
sense
shows
up
just
a
bit
huge
flavor
to
this
one
flavor
is
likewise
obviously
stronger
on
the
funky
sourness
and
a
little
milder
on
the
fruits
a
touch
of
cheese
and
white
wine
tasty
brew
if
youre
feeling
like
a
sour
one
body
is
busy
with
strong
carbonation
that
highlights
the
tartness
well
overall
a
very
nice
brew
although
im
not
sure
if
i
could
drink
more
than
one
d
very
drinkable
with
a
good
level
of
acidity
and
nice
complexity
i
particularly
enjoy
the
peach
character
of
the
flavor
it
is
a
somewhat
unusual
flavor
to
find
in
a
lambic
and
quite
pleasant
drinkability
is
not
bad
for
sure
but
one
is
definitely
plenty
for
a
sitting
in
my
opinion
id
much
prefer
drinking
a
lambic
that
isnt
one
of
the
best
ive
had
over
drinking
just
an
okay
beer
of
most
other
styles
so
i
cant
shouldnt
complain
too
much
upon
buying
this
i
didnt
know
that
this
was
a
sour
beer
as
for
sour
beers
i
still
dont
like
them
pours
a
very
clear
gold
with
relatively
no
haze
all
the
sediment
settled
in
the
bottom
very
tart
sort
of
dry
with
a
hint
of
cheese
on
the
palate
dry
tart
and
a
little
bit
of
currant
i
wish
that
i
had
some
food
that
you
eat
with
wines
to
go
along
with
this
this
was
not
a
good
brewday
beer
not
a
good
beer
for
me
but
for
people
that
enjoy
lambic
sours
taste
is
tart
citric
with
dry
apricot
light
tangy
funky
yeast
character
light
fruity
sweetness
and
faint
sweet
white
wine
underneath
and
a
bit
more
hard
to
pin
down
it
has
aftertaste
of
funky
yeasty
dough
and
dry
apricot
i
have
tried
to
score
for
the
style
not
my
personnal
view
otherwise
it
would
have
got
a
few
minus
numbers
i
think
this
is
one
of
the
better
examples
of
gueuze
ive
had
this
is
very
very
good
the
complexity
feel
and
quenching
nature
of
this
beer
add
up
to
outstanding
drinkability
and
while
it
is
certainly
sour
it
isnt
so
sour
that
it
makes
my
stomach
churn
either
i
got
a
bad
bottle
of
this
or
i
am
really
swimming
against
the
tide
ive
enjoyed
other
lambics
ive
had
but
this
was
terrible
maybe
its
just
the
gueze
style
i
dont
like
this
poured
a
champagne
color
with
little
head
and
some
carbonation
unfortunately
both
the
nose
and
taste
were
a
rancid
mixture
of
very
sour
apples
and
vinegar
early
on
i
kept
thinking
maybe
the
sour
would
be
followed
by
a
sweet
sensation
a
la
flemish
sours
but
instead
it
just
kept
getting
more
sour
and
acidic
ended
up
cleaning
the
drain
pours
a
slightly
hazy
slightly
reddish
gold
with
a
nice
bubbly
head
nose
is
lemony
citrus
with
a
nice
balanced
funk
and
the
tartness
almost
puckers
the
mouth
before
even
tasting
it
flavor
is
lemon
curd
or
marmalade
with
strong
acidity
creating
a
sublime
tart
finish
the
heavy
carbonation
contributes
a
welcome
champagne
character
at
5
i
could
drink
this
all
night
most
certainly
not
a
drink
for
everyone
but
if
lambic
is
your
thing
you
will
truly
love
this
it
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
drinkability
off
the
charts
for
a
sour
would
gladly
visit
this
one
again
this
is
a
excellent
gueuze
and
extremely
drinkable
for
the
style
the
sourness
is
prominent
but
never
so
powerful
that
it
hinders
the
drinkability
i
found
myself
liking
it
more
as
time
went
by
and
its
with
some
sadness
that
i
finished
my
glass
oh
well
kriek
de
ranke
up
next
d
i
love
wild
beers
and
this
one
certainly
lived
up
to
my
expectations
its
unfortunate
we
have
to
pay
so
much
for
these
great
beers
here
in
the
us
because
i
would
love
to
drink
them
more
often
pours
a
nice
surprisingly
clear
orange
color
very
nice
looking
with
a
massive
head
2
inches
fluffy
cloudy
and
white
really
a
great
looking
beer
the
smell
is
sweettarts
and
garbage
apple
and
grape
skins
sour
tart
old
moldy
bread
a
little
bit
of
spice
some
lemon
peel
really
nice
though
i
doubt
if
i
could
distinguish
it
from
some
others
in
smell
alone
the
taste
is
much
richer
and
more
delicious
than
just
sweet
tarts
the
sour
candy
like
sweetness
comes
in
first
but
theres
a
big
powerful
bottom
af
bready
dry
malt
theres
a
note
of
flowers
some
lemon
spice
pepper
nice
and
yeasty
too
i
think
the
taste
of
the
malt
is
the
most
distinctive
factor
but
i
also
taste
strawberries
old
ones
tart
apple
skins
and
the
dry
sting
of
carbonation
is
very
pleasant
the
body
is
very
light
as
you
would
expect
and
quite
good
the
drinkability
is
much
better
than
you
would
expect
from
a
wild
ale
it
keeps
me
going
back
forf
mlore
because
its
not
all
tart
dry
sour
taste
low
on
the
vinegary
acidic
tastes
theres
something
to
be
said
for
a
malt
presence
and
a
nice
fruitiness
d
easy
to
finish
this
bottle
and
its
at
a
strength
that
makes
it
sessionable
however
the
acid
in
this
one
would
rip
my
stomach
apart
a
375
is
about
perfect
for
a
person
o
unique
and
complex
refreshing
smooth
very
good
this
is
one
sour
beer
lip
puckering
lemony
sourness
flavor
is
of
grapes
pepper
and
citrus
bubbly
on
the
tongue
with
a
medium
body
very
clean
finish
the
cx2010
bottling
drinking
this
immediately
after
a
beatification
and
a
week
after
a
doesjel
im
reminded
how
special
this
beer
is
it
is
everything
a
gueuze
should
be
soft
delicate
citrusy
and
bright
with
a
delicate
funk
earthy
mushroomy
less
tannic
than
a
3font
cleaner
and
more
balanced
in
sourness
with
a
better
blend
of
citric
and
lactic
acids
softer
with
a
wheaty
dextrinous
fullness
that
tempers
the
sourness
and
lends
a
sweetness
soft

d
this
beer
is
something
special
and
im
glad
that
i
had
a
chance
to
try
this
after
wanting
to
try
it
for
so
long
the
depth
texture
and
general
awesomeness
of
this
beer
makes
it
nearly
impossible
to
put
down
d
this
is
a
very
good
gueuze
not
sure
i
can
really
call
it
highly
drinkable
it
has
such
funkiness
but
on
the
other
hand
it
has
a
nice
dryness
that
whets
the
tastebuds
and
makes
me
want
more
drinkability
i
guess
this
is
almost
a
wash
definitely
a
mood
beer
thats
for
sure
oaky
funky
dry
and
sour
all
at
once
and
can
definitely
hit
the
spot
on
the
right
night
would
certainly
have
again
in
the
future
and
a
perfect
example
of
what
a
gueuze
should
be
d
very
drinkable
not
at
all
overly
sour
this
may
be
the
best
gueuze
ive
ever
had
dabsolutely
super
nice
strong
and
tart
without
getting
crazy
a
beautiful
brew
that
is
well
deserved
of
its
high
ranking
has
a
very
light
body
almost
delicate
goes
down
smooth
but
leaves
the
mouth
dry
due
to
the
sourness
overall
a
very
nice
beer
glad
i
tried
it
and
its
one
of
the
more
inexpensive
sours
i
can
get
my
hands
on
bonus
d
good
stuff
but
one
is
enough
j
overall
very
nice
relatively
affordable
and
easy
to
find
gueuze
give
it
a
shot
if
you
see
it
pours
a
pale
yellow
gold
with
a
nice
white
head
the
immediate
aroma
is
an
earthy
funkiness
barnyard
and
quite
a
bit
of
acidic
tartness
the
taste
follows
in
the
same
direction
with
a
bit
of
citrus
and
a
moutherpuckering
sour
flavor
a
little
bit
of
pale
malt
eventually
comes
through
toward
the
end
but
this
one
is
sour
through
and
through
falling
only
behind
duck
duck
gooze
and
la
folie
in
terms
of
sour
drinkability
for
me
d
easy
drinking
sour
beer
fairly
good
pucker
power
and
a
really
nice
light
flavor
this
is
so
light
that
almost
evaporates
in
your
mouth
excellent
highly
recommended
d
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
low
alcohol
5
gives
you
the
option
of
drinking
a
couple
and
feeling
fine
overall
this
is
a
very
good
gueuze
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
a
sessionable
gueuze
for
those
that
appreciate
the
style
nice
drinkability
for
what
many
would
consider
an
unusual
ale
great
for
summer
if
i
hadnt
had
beers
like
la
folie
or
consecration
this
would
be
really
hard
to
handle
luckily
my
sour
cherry
has
been
popped
so
to
speak
so
i
can
enjoy
this
however
im
glad
it
comes
in
this
little
bottle
because
i
couldnt
handle
much
more
than
this
one
serving
thanks
jyounger30
the
taste
is
even
better
i
think
up
front
very
acidicagain
like
rotten
lemons
but
the
funk
in
the
back
is
way
more
complex
than
the
nose
suggest
its
barnyard
as
so
many
have
said
but
its
more
than
that
its
musky
its
moldy
its
got
a
touch
of
sweetness
this
is
the
most
challenging
beer
i
have
ever
had
but
its
also
one
of
the
most
enjoyable
i
only
wish
i
had
bought
more
than
one
bottle
very
interesting
may
have
to
return
to
this
beer
again
some
time
low
abv
and
the
fact
that
it
is
not
too
tart
making
it
a
good
drinkable
beer
striking
a
good
balance
between
the
tart
sourness
of
the
funk
and
the
malty
beer
backbone
my
local
store
just
started
having
this
on
a
regular
basis
and
i
am
a
fan
the
translucent
golden
orange
filled
the
glass
with
an
excellent
show
of
soapy
white
head
the
brett
is
prevalent
in
this
beer
some
horse
blanket
funk
and
b
o
are
also
obvious
the
taste
is
different
than
the
smell
some
tart
sour
lemon
fresh
cut
grass
and
faint
hops
dominate
this
beer
the
dry
white
wine
texture
hits
the
front
of
the
tongue
but
it
does
have
a
nice
clean
bubbly
finish
even
if
it
is
a
little
chaulky
at
first
when
i
want
a
good
go
to
sour
this
is
it
i
have
a
feeling
ill
be
buying
quite
a
bit
drinking
this
beer
conjures
up
childhood
memories
of
playing
under
the
plum
tree
in
my
backyard
great
stuff
d
this
is
a
very
easy
drinkable
beer
perhaps
the
best
gueze
i
have
ever
had
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
and
everyone
i
just
got
to
go
to
the
shop
and
pick
more
up
before
they
run
out
of
it
since
girardin
gueuze
1882
is
only
the
fifth
gueuze
that
ive
ever
reviewed
i
have
no
idea
if
its
the
best
version
in
the
world
or
not
consider
the
impressions
of
other
reviewers
on
that
point
not
mine
nevertheless
this
is
a
fantastic
experience
that
i
wholeheartedly
recommend
for
anyone
who
loves
craft
beer
whatever
your
style
preferences
d
a
high
quality
gueuze
complex
and
sophisticated
yet
with
plenty
of
that
unique
spontaneous
edginess
its
delightfully
sour
it
could
even
give
some
of
the
beers
from
cantillon
a
go
regarding
levels
of
acidity
but
it
never
goes
out
of
hand
i
would
also
like
to
especially
emphasize
how
great
the
finish
in
this
one
is
really
magnificent
glad
i
bought
3
pounds
of
cheese
this
stuff
made
my
weekend
this
is
an
outstanding
gueuze
easily
the
best
that
i
have
had
and
one
of
the
best
sours
overall
i
was
very
pleased
to
come
across
this
one
as
i
have
never
seen
it
anywhere
else
i
only
find
myself
wishing
i
had
bought
the
other
bottle
they
had
oh
well
some
other
lucky
person
will
enjoy
the
hell
out
of
it
hopefully
d
very
light
with
a
clean
but
sour
aftertaste
easy
and
drinkable
a
good
change
of
pace
from
a
heavy
ris
light
to
medium
body
with
high
carbonation
on
the
mouthfeel
nice
example
for
its
style
light
bodied
with
a
high
level
of
carbonation
and
a
very
dry
mouthfeel
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
sour
flavors
are
bright
and
have
highnotes
with
a
pleasant
bittersour
character
some
sours
can
make
you
pucker
and
can
be
hard
to
get
down
more
chore
than
fun
this
one
is
all
quite
delicious
a
very
friendly
and
inviting
sour
beer
come
back
for
the
finale
of
the
third
unorganized
invitational
t
u
i
tomorrow
and
afterwards
well
announce
the
winner
refreshing
beverage
for
summertime
will
drink
again
i
wish
this
wasnt
10
bucks
a
bottle
i
decided
tonight
would
be
a
good
night
to
have
something
sour
girardin
1882
gueuze
has
a
glowing
orange
color
to
it
along
with
a
small
and
fizzy
white
head
that
does
not
last
very
long
smell
is
wonderfully
funky
and
sour
with
traces
of
fresh
lemon
juice
white
wine
and
some
dry
earth
tones
flavor
really
attacks
the
palate
as
soon
as
it
enters
with
a
big
dose
of
sourness
lemon
is
the
dominant
flavor
and
unlike
many
gueuzes
that
end
in
sort
of
a
dry
way
this
one
stays
juicy
throughout
mouthfeel
is
perfectly
carbonated
making
it
a
very
refreshing
beer
that
would
be
ideal
for
a
hot
summer
day
the
sour
flavors
do
not
linger
for
too
long
and
it
does
not
destroy
the
palate
so
i
dont
see
why
one
cant
put
back
a
few
bottles
of
this
in
a
sitting
i
know
i
would
like
to
this
is
a
wow
beer
for
me
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
had
in
a
very
long
time
possibly
ever
if
the
cash
was
there
i
would
be
purchasing
a
case
of
this
elixir
without
hesitation
cheers
d
drinkability
is
pretty
good
tons
of
in
your
face
flavor
make
this
one
more
of
a
sipper
that
youd
want
to
take
your
time
on
this
is
a
very
nice
example
of
the
style
that
i
wouldnt
hesitate
to
try
again
the
only
real
flaw
that
is
worth
mentioning
is
the
head
or
lack
thereof
if
that
is
the
biggest
problem
a
beer
has
then
said
beer
is
pretty
well
off
in
my
opinion
great
drinkabilty
and
a
great
pairing
to
a
variety
of
foods
d
this
was
my
first
foray
into
the
world
of
gueuzes
and
i
continue
to
enjoy
it
as
ive
developed
my
palate
and
appreciation
for
the
style
i
found
this
beer
to
be
easy
to
consume
despite
the
overall
tart
and
sour
nature
of
the
beer
a
good
place
to
start
for
those
looking
to
explore
the
style
very
nice
example
of
a
gueuze
would
definitely
have
again
375
ml

all

375ml

a

honey
lemon
wet

a
floral
aroma
sour
and
acidic
with
a
little
musty
woodiness
starts
with
a
little
sweetness
and
then
dry
and
tart
has
enough
malt
body
to
balance
the
tartness
and
that
is
really
the
kicker
for
me
light
body
and
champagnelike
carbonation
the
balance
and
complexity
are
amazing
i
didnt
really
like
gueuze
before
this
but
the
balance
and
drinkability
of
this
beer
has
completely
turned
me
around
overall
this
one
really
shocked
me
i
love
sours
and
this
one
definitely
ranks
at
the
top
it
reminded
me
a
lot
of
rr
beatification
even
a
bit
better
im
definitely
going
to
look
for
a
few
more
bottles
pours
a
murky
cloudy
hazy
gold
in
color
with
a
nice
pillowy
white
head
on
top
of
the
beer
man
this
is
funky
among
the
strongest
funk
smells
i
have
ever
gotten
from
a
beer
lots
of
barnyard
some
musty
notes
and
a
little
bit
of
sourness
taste
is
an
abundance
of
tart
sourness
a
little
bit
of
a
acidic
quality
to
boot
very
complex
and
sour
the
taste
is
incredible
as
it
warms
up
it
really
gets
better
incredibly
full
and
creamy
on
the
mouthfeel
ive
been
looking
for
this
beer
for
sometime
and
it
is
well
worth
the
wait
if
i
keep
up
at
this
pace
my
entire
cellar
is
going
to
be
nothing
but
sours
drinkability
a
showstopper
of
a
gueuze
very
light
and
refreshing
while
maintaining
a
puckering
sourness
with
a
sweet
touch
easy
to
sip
on
and
enjoy
during
the
spring
or
a
summer
afternoon
d
this
is
a
pretty
interesting
beer
as
a
person
who
is
just
getting
into
sours
i
find
it
quite
tolerable
and
very
enjoyable
its
definitely
something
different
but
can
be
appreciated
by
a
sour
lover
or
a
person
looking
to
expand
their
horizons
d
split
with
ftownthrowdown
and
roymunson
and
my
sample
was
plenty
shared
a
couple
bottles
at
den
trollkelder
in
gent
what
a
beer
i
had
this
next
to
the
marriage
parfait
and
and
filtered
white
label
1882
and
while
it
was
fairly
similar
to
the
boon
there
was
little
resemblance
to
the
white
label
this
had
more
oak
barrel
character
tasting
like
i
was
drinking
from
a
wooden
mug
along
with
lemonlime
fruit
bit
sour
tartness
and
underlying
farmhouse
funk
heck
of
a
beer
give
it
a
try
maybe
my
favorite
gueuze
d
this
is
my
favorite
springsummer
beer
its
refreshing
without
getting
boring
most
definitely
a
session
beer
i
could
drink
this
all
night
long
i
love
to
pair
this
beer
with
food
the
flavors
mesh
very
well
with
all
different
types
of
food
try
it
with
seafood
cheese
or
a
hearty
burger
this
is
like
carbonated
vinegar
edit
definitely
gets
more
sour
in
an
abrasive
vinegary
way
as
it
gets
warmer
a
great
choice
this
one
should
best
be
enjoyed
by
itself
a
great
funky
tartness
if
sour
beers
are
not
your
thing
stay
away
otherwise
hunt
this
one
down
pricy
but
i
can
see
why
i
could
drink
this
all
day
due
to
the
smoothness
this
beer
deserves
a
fat
pat
on
the
back
notes
really
tasty
gueuze
i
think
it
was
a
little
to
vinegary
but
this
is
still
really
good
one
d
nice
beer
one
bottle
is
good
for
my
stomach
starts
to
feel
a
little
sour
which
takes
away
from
its
drinkability
for
me
pours
a
crystal
clear
golden
yellow
color
covered
by
one
finger
of
off
white
head
clove
and
green
apple
aromas
and
quite
a
bit
of
sour
a
vinegar
taste
is
present
but
its
subtle
green
apple
there
as
well
sour
as
hell
nice
maltiness
a
little
bitter
its
carbonation
is
too
high
in
my
opinion
but
it
has
a
really
good
body
to
it
overall
a
little
too
sour
but
still
drinkable
this
is
a
pretty
great
beer
i
love
this
style
especially
since
i
love
champagne
and
stinky
cheese
and
these
beers
seem
to
combine
those
experiences
plus
this
one
had
limeade
to
boot
this
beer
pours
a
cloudy
amber
with
a
2
fingered
white
head
and
some
lacing
the
smell
is
sour
very
sour
the
taste
has
a
nice
malt
base
to
it
with
a
nice
sour
finish
nicely
balanced
i
think
i
could
enjoy
a
little
more
sour
though
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
with
a
good
carbonation
level
nicely
drinkable
brew
but
for
the
pricetag
its
probably
just
a
one
time
taster
good
drinkability
but
definitely
a
sipper
because
the
sourness
starts
to
get
a
little
intense
great
beer
overall
though
this
is
a
great
beer
that
i
will
be
having
again
in
the
near
future
i
would
take
this
over
a
good
champagne
any
day
absolutely
fantastic
what
a
feeling
it
is
to
try
the
best
of
something
anything
and
find
that
it
truly
lives
up
to
the
hype
pour
is
bit
darker
than
most
with
a
nice
head
with
retention
white
color
is
very
light
amber
with
a
murk
that
brings
it
out
more
the
sour
scent
is
there
and
a
bit
more
oaky
and
smokey
that
others
the
taste
is
great
light
oak
light
vanilla
light
meaty
which
with
the
smokiness
is
bacon
apple
like
apple
on
the
more
sour
side
which
is
astounding
for
the
palate
range
fantastic
for
grilled
food
overall
this
is
a
very
funky
very
sour
beer
but
thats
not
all
it
is
the
citrus
fruits
manage
to
give
this
another
dimension
and
take
an
edge
off
definitely
worth
a
shot
pours
a
cloudy
bright
goldorange
that
is
simply
beautiful
to
look
at
smells
of
sourness
funk
and
wild
yeast
dominate
the
nose
first
sip
is
mouth
puckering
that
is
just
right
with
musty
cider
notes
that
are
not
too
sour
and
not
over
the
top
funky
there
is
an
amazing
mouthfeel
here
as
the
bubbles
dance
joyfully
on
the
tongue
very
nice
indeed
md
dry
and
puckering
are
the
two
words
that
come
to
mind
on
this
one
very
crisp
and
refreashing
sipper
excellent
carbonation
on
this
one
taste
is
excellent
sour
fruity
apples
lemon
with
dry
and
light
sweetish
finish
mouthfeel
is
rather
light
with
very
high
carbonation
and
light
warming
feeling
overall
the
beer
is
excellent
very
good
refreshing
citrus
brew
of
course
lambic
making
isnt
a
science
its
an
art
it
involves
blending
a
proud
sense
of
tradition
and
handmedown
knowledge
of
an
ancient
brewing
technique
id
strongly
recommend
a
trip
to
brussels
for
anyone
who
has
an
appreciation
for
the
dying
art
of
true
lambic
go
to
see
the
cobwebs
and
spiders
the
open
air
coolships
rows
of
exploding
barrels
and
the
racks
of
aging
corked
bottles
oh
and
be
sure
to
drink
plenty

i
was
suprised
by
this
beer
i
went
into
not
expecting
to
care
for
it
much
but
was
wrong
pours
golden
orange
hazy
with
a
1
finger
creamy
white
head
good
retention
and
lacing
smell
is
funky
some
real
sour
apple
with
some
yeast
and
a
floral
kick
to
it
taste
is
somewhat
simple
i
thought
it
was
sour
it
was
funky
some
yeast
i
really
cant
say
i
noticed
this
and
noticed
that
just
overall
it
was
nice
and
sour
dry
mouthfeel
with
a
bit
of
a
lemony
aftertaste
fair
amount
of
carbonation
overall
a
nice
beer
and
very
drinkable
serve
it
a
little
warmer
and
sip
away
one
of
these
should
last
you
a
while
mouthfeel
was
clean
and
crisp
with
a
nice
sharp
carbonation
this
is
a
great
way
cleanse
or
wake
up
the
palate
and
maybe
drink
two
glasses
but
not
a
whole
lot
more
thoroughly
enjoyable
d
this
brew
is
damned
impressiv
and
really
satisfies
it
is
a
bit
confusing
as
some
of
the
flavor
remind
you
of
lambics
then
champagne
i
will
have
to
seek
a
somewhat
local
retailer
of
this
goodness
and
make
this
happen
on
a
fairly
regular
basis
great
balance
of
sweet
flavors
and
sour
funky
goodness
just
damned
good
mouthfeel
is
tart
medium
bodied
peppery
mildly
sweet
and
spicy
in
the
forefront
leading
to
a
tart
lemony
bite
at
the
end

d
low
but
exceptional
all
the
same
a
few
ounces
of
girardin
will
wake
your
tastebuds
up
a
great
choice
to
break
out
in
the
middle
of
a
heavy
beer
tasting
to
shock
palates
into
overdrive
overall
a
good
but
not
great
beer
glad
i
tried
it
as
i
can
knock
it
off
my
top
100
quest
but
i
was
really
disappointed
with
it
after
ready
the
reviews
and
having
a
lot
of
sour
beers
lately
i
was
expecting
more
gonna
have
to
try
another
bottle
sometime
to
make
sure
i
get
a
good
sample
or
valid
my
review
do
recommend
as
it
is
a
unique
style
but
dont
rush
to
get
it
as
is
its
not
top
100
for
me
one
and
done
except
for
rereviewing
one
of
the
gems
of
the
lambic
world
and
one
of
the
best
sours
ive
had
to
date
delicious
pours
hazy
bronze
with
a
1
cm
tall
white
head
pleasant
aroma
of
bitter
crabapples
yeast
and
musk
wicked
bitter
bite
very
sour
and
acidic
with
a
mostly
apple
flavor
and
some
metal
this
bitterness
continues
throughout
but
at
the
very
end
the
beer
takes
a
mellow
sweeter
turn
a
buttery
biscuitlike
flavor
burns
thorugh
sometimes
it
leans
into
a
cheesemascarpone
flavor
delicious
sipper
of
a
beer
md
this
is
fantastic
drink
and
is
to
be
savoured
and
enjoyed
i
could
have
a
few
but
over
about
3
hours
if
you
like
petrus
aged
pale
you
should
also
really
dig
this
beer
serving
type
bottle
d
why
is
this
not
available
around
here
stellar
almost
like
a
russian
river
a
really
great
sour
beer
the
price
is
high
but
worth
tracking
down
at
least
once
it
is
certainly
very
good
and
the
balance
leads
to
a
sublime
drinkability
but
i
love
the
cantillon
if
i
am
springing
for
a
worldclass
lambic
that
is
the
direction
id
recommend
i
have
never
plowed
through
a
gueze
like
i
have
through
this
one
incredible
effort
must
find
more
d
gueuzes
are
not
everyday
drinkers
for
most
of
us
but
if
i
had
to
have
one
every
day
this
might
be
it
just
tart
enough
vaguely
sweet
and
with
a
good
finish
of
grain
this
one
ill
highly
recommend
and
plan
to
have
again
overall
only
if
its
your
thing
really
glad
i
had
this
one
for
my
300
ive
had
this
before
but
had
not
been
able
to
sit
down
and
review
it
this
is
a
superb
combination
of
a
beer
that
is
light
enough
to
be
had
in
a
hot
day
low
enough
alcohol
to
be
a
session
beer
and
enough
flavor
packed
to
even
be
a
sipper
funk
all
the
way
sour
with
asweet
oakiness
somewhere
in
the
middle
bone
dry
finish
lots
of
fruits
somewhere
in
the
middle
its
like
biting
into
a
lemon
sliced
on
top
of
a
horseblanket
and
despite
that
imagery
its
a
grand
delivery
on
an
audacious
promise
once
my
cheeks
reinflated
i
realized
just
how
refreshing
and
spirited
this
beer
really
is
if
you
like
the
style
it
goes
down
smooth
easy
and
happily
so
not
only
do
i
like
the
style
i
love
the
way
this
once
represents
the
best
of
what
it
strives
to
be
notes
its
exactly
what
i
had
anticipated
and
hoped
and
for
the
price
its
a
really
solid
gueuze
one
id
definitely
pick
up
if
i
wanted
to
introduce
someone
to
the
style
drinkability
is
a
strange
question
for
a
sour
i
finished
the
bottle
but
do
you
want
to
do
more
than
one
sour
at
a
sitting
i
enjoyed
the
brew
and
would
gladly
drink
it
again
truly
a
great
brew
and
deserves
to
be
tried
by
every
sour
fan
d
this
is
my
first
gueze
and
i
believe
i
spoiled
myself
with
a
very
nice
selection
its
exactly
what
i
was
expecting
an
overly
sour
lambic
style
taste
sans
any
fruit
very
nice
id
rate
this
higher
in
drinkability
if
it
were
cheaper
its
a
wonderful
beer
however
especially
for
this
time
year
i
could
drink
these
all
day
very
refreshing
truly
the
champagne
of
beer
a
new
favourite
how
i
wish
i
could
get
this
back
in
canada
pours
a
golden
amber
with
a
head
that
starts
out
thick
but
quickly
fades
to
just
a
thin
layer
that
lasts
for
a
few
minutes
oaky
with
grapefruit
and
funky
aromas
the
flavors
are
all
perfectly
balanced
which
i
think
makes
this
gueuze
more
complex
than
any
others
ive
had
d
4
5
fantastic
gueuze
smells
great
mildy
sour
fantastic
flavors
world
class
good
drinkability
although
this
is
too
sour
for
me
to
want
more
than
one
this
would
be
great
with
a
rich
cheesy
dish
im
thinking
french
onion
soup
with
lots
of
goopy
melted
cheese
on
top
notably
tarter
than
3
fonteinen
or
oud
beersel
girardin
has
a
sharp
acidity
that
inspires
the
appetite
after
an
exuberant
uncorking
the
beer
pours
out
virtually
uncarbonated
in
hazed
honey
gold
a
sharp
and
irascible
ale
thats
not
overly
sour
but
has
a
honed
acidic
punch
quite
enjoyable
d
flavorful
goes
down
easily
not
filling
at
all
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
its
a
taste
that
takes
some
getting
used
to
but
you
tell
its
very
wellmade
d
every
base
covered
here
lookssmellstastes
great
and
very
easy
to
sip
the
real
deal
d
gueuzes
are
expensive
but
ill
certainly
revisit
this
one
this
will
probably
be
the
one
i
buy
several
of
for
aging
purposes
im
loving
my
foray
into
the
world
of
sour
beers
so
far
drinkable
i
certainly
want
more
but
the
flavor
of
this
beer
is
intense
i
love
it
but
375
ml
is
enough
in
one
sitting
drinkability
was
quite
good
for
such
an
intensely
sour
beer
it
was
well
balanced
light
and
quite
refreshing
i
simply
cannot
think
of
a
beer
that
would
make
for
a
better
aperitif
this
is
truly
a
worldclass
gueuze
when
i
finally
managed
to
get
it
in
the
glass
it
produces
mostly
a
huge
white
head
it
eventually
turned
in
to
a
yelloworange
beer
with
a
lot
of
bubbles
i
suppose
the
aroma
is
pretty
much
the
same
for
all
gueuze
cob
webs
dusty
oak
barrel
horse
blanket
not
really
sure
what
else
to
say
about
it
over
the
top
tart
very
much
like
orange
juice
concentrate
not
a
bad
flavor
be
very
aggressive
medium
body
highly
effervescent
dry
but
not
as
dry
as
expected
i
wish
i
would
have
shared
this
with
somebody
i
like
it
but
its
a
bit
much
for
me
the
body
is
full
yet
crisp
and
delicate
an
outstanding
beer
that
i
strive
to
be
able
to
replicate
some
day
this
is
my
first
gueuze
and
its
been
an
experience
this
is
a
very
good
beer
ill
admit
that
this
is
not
ever
going
to
be
one
of
my
favorite
styles
its
just
a
little
sour
for
my
taste
but
this
is
definitely
a
beer
to
check
out
notes
really
enjoyed
this
one
of
my
favorite
gueuzes
to
date
pours
a
hazy
light
amber
color
with
1
inch
of
sparkling
offwhitepinkish
orange
head
good
retention
and
a
thin
ring
of
spotty
lacing
smells
of
green
apples
sour
cherries
apple
cider
vinegar
barnyard
funk
raisins
and
lemon
tastes
of
sour
apples
funk
and
musty
basement
light
malt
with
a
dry
lemon
and
sour
cherry
finish
medium
in
body
with
lots
of
carbonation
that
fizzes
on
your
mouth
scattering
the
sourness
all
over
and
leaving
the
dry
finish
to
hold
on
leaving
a
lasting
taste
sour
tart
sweet
and
funky
low
in
alcohol
and
easy
to
drink
for
the
sour
fruit
lover
a
great
example
of
a
gueuze
the
sediment
is
extremely
tart
id
decant
carefully
an
excellent
gueuze
top
notch
this
would
be
a
goto
sour
beer
for
me
if
i
could
get
it
readily
pours
orangish
colored
with
a
wispy
white
head
smell
is
lighty
funky
sour
barnyard
taste
is
balanced
sweet
and
sourness
begins
very
lightly
sweet
and
then
finishes
tart
and
dry
bubbly
fizzy
active
carbonation
and
a
nice
moutfeel
that
i
havent
gotten
in
some
guezes
this
was
really
nice
and
easily
one
of
my
favorites
of
the
style
dvery
approachable
type
of
beer
it
was
good
certainly
not
ovdf
powering
d
i
really
liked
this
gueuze
a
great
beer
to
start
the
day
with
i
wouldnt
suggest
more
than
one
but
its
something
id
definitely
keep
gonig
back
to
this
beer
is
not
for
everyone
it
is
a
mix
of
1000
green
apples
and
a
dark
musty
cellar
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
the
look
of
this
beer
is
a
beautiful
color
of
amber
it
smells
musty
and
sour
mmmmm
it
pours
nicely
into
my
glass
with
very
little
head
when
poured
gently
and
with
respect
for
this
amazing
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
refreshing
and
a
pleasure
to
the
pallet
i
highly
suggest
trying
this
beer
bottle
courtesy
of
purfock
poured
a
orangey
color
lambic
with
a
huge
foamy
head
with
excellent
retention
and
some
good
lacing
aroma
of
green
apple
and
tart
is
really
great
taste
is
a
complex
mix
between
some
green
apple
some
sour
and
tart
notes
with
some
light
funky
barnyard
notes
full
body
with
great
carbonation
i
appreciated
that
the
level
of
acidity
is
manageable
and
doesnt
totally
overrun
the
complexities
excellent
beer
lacks
the
intense
funkiness
of
a
cantillon
but
this
helps
make
it
very
refreshing
drinkable
and
more
accessible
than
some
other
examples
of
the
style
this
is
one
forward
funky
brew
a
great
example
of
a
classic
gueuze
awesome
beer
one
of
the
best
if
not
the
best
sour
ale
ive
tried
i
wish
i
could
get
this
at
my
local
store
because
it
would
be
a
weekly
indulgence
well
worth
seeking
a
bottle
out
i
like
lambics
and
i
am
really
enjoying
this
traditional
gueuze
makes
me
want
to
start
planning
a
trip
to
belgium
right
away
i
sprang
for
a
bottle
of
the
2004
batch
on
a
whim
a
bit
of
a
gusher
on
opening
filled
the
room
with
a
lemony
yeasty
aroma
once
in
a
glass
the
head
calmed
down
and
there
was
a
very
pleasant
level
of
effervescence
with
every
sip
which
is
the
point
here
sipping
is
the
way
to
drink
this
one
the
taste
is
slightly
salty
and
strawlike
up
front
with
lemon
undertones
and
the
finish
is
dominated
by
a
surprisingly
strong
wood
character
really
interesting
and
a
refreshing
drink
as
light
in
body
as
it
is
call
me
crazy
but
i
think
this
would
be
great
with
pizza
good
pizza
great
beer
d
this
is
a
sipper
for
sure
because
it
is
so
intensely
sour
while
saying
that
i
think
while
this
would
take
a
long
time
to
drink
a
lot
of
i
could
sip
on
it
all
night
overall
definately
an
interesting
beer
kinda
like
a
berliner
weisse
mixed
with
some
belgian
funk
glad
i
tried
this
beer
but
i
dont
know
that
i
will
seek
it
out
i
dont
know
if
this
is
my
kind
of
beer
i
will
have
to
try
others
in
the
style
and
see
thanks
again
to
mikesgroove
for
this
one
thanks
to
hardtarget
for
sharing
this
rare
example
d
refreshing
and
palate
cleansing
excellent
pours
a
nice
golden
amberish
color
that
has
a
decent
whitish
head
that
rises
and
falls
fairly
quickly
nose
is
bringing
the
funk
minor
antiseptic
tones
are
mixed
with
a
more
dominatingly
sweet
character
flavor
is
great
nice
sour
tang
wonderful
level
of
funk
well
done
very
smooth
feel
this
is
so
easy
to
drink
does
it
come
in
gallons
had
to
keep
myself
from
gulping
down
d
i
have
to
admit
i
couldnt
finish
the
whole
bottle
each
time
ive
had
a
sour
beer
its
been
a
little
more
drinkable
but
i
feel
that
the
depth
of
flavor
gets
somewhat
lost
due
to
the
tartness
maybe
im
missing
something
i
just
feel
like
it
needs
something
to
balance
the
flavor
thats
not
there
first
beer
in
this
style
first
from
this
brewery
certainly
got
my
attention
did
not
know
much
about
this
before
drinking
but
was
very
content
with
the
surprise
in
the
end
wow
this
was
something
special
the
fact
that
this
is
unfiltered
is
impressive
also
will
definitely
buy
again
in
the
future
highly
recommended
to
others
bone
dry
and
refreshing
with
great
carbonation
one
of
the
easier
to
drink
gueuzes
ive
had
overall
impression
tart
but
drinkable
enjoyed
it
so
see
it
being
a
great
summer
sipper
great
afternoon
drink
d
a
little
to
much
lemon
in
this
for
me
still
a
good
gueuze
but
wouldnt
say
one
of
the
best
good
drinkability
it
maintains
a
good
balance
of
sourness
to
drinkability
it
avoids
being
severely
puckering
leaving
an
empty
glass
quickly
is
tangy
malty
slightly
sweet
lots
of
lemon
slight
yeast
floral
and
some
spices
the
taste
is
slightly
sweet
then
the
tangybitter
kick
in
big
time
getting
some
yeast
notes
and
spicyness
the
finish
is
dry
bitter
and
tangy
medium
body
drinkable
not
bad
at
all
much
better
than
i
thought
it
would
be
might
just
seek
out
other
gueuze
recommended
thanks
again
bill
for
a
chance
to
try
something
different
this
was
defiantly
an
interesting
brew
for
me
i
am
never
sure
what
i
am
going
to
get
when
i
open
something
like
this
but
there
is
only
one
way
to
find
out
popped
the
cork
and
it
let
out
a
nice
pop
and
audible
hiss
so
this
one
was
defiantly
still
alive
poured
into
a
tulip
it
was
a
light
orange
brown
with
a
very
nice
three
finger
head
of
lace
and
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
streaming
up
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
nice
retention
only
gradually
let
the
head
fade
away
what
was
left
was
a
very
nice
set
of
concentric
side
glass
rings
of
lace
smell
was
very
sour
lots
of
grapes
and
other
fruits
a
bit
light
on
the
nose
before
the
sour
wrath
kicks
in
flavor
was
very
full
and
robust
nice
yeast
filled
flavor
wrecks
your
taste
buds
but
calms
down
considerably
on
the
finish
a
huge
rush
of
sour
fruit
than
kicks
into
overdrive
and
puckers
your
lips
through
the
finish
this
was
a
wonderfully
unique
brew
that
had
a
very
good
flavor
and
a
light
fruity
feel
that
really
made
it
shine
i
could
see
why
it
is
rated
so
high
as
it
is
quite
different
then
anything
i
had
tried
in
the
past
this
was
very
much
a
great
brew
and
something
i
would
look
forward
to
sipping
on
again
highly
recommend
this
one
drinkability
is
good
the
sourness
is
strong
but
not
overpowering
the
backing
malt
and
light
citrus
sweetness
balances
it
fairly
well
d
this
beer
has
a
nice
depth
but
it
is
a
bit
overpowered
by
the
tartness
that
leads
me
to
take
another
sip
to
try
and
unravel
this
beer
i
would
like
to
try
some
different
ages
on
this
beer
to
see
how
it
matures
pours
a
good
head
from
a
beer
that
is
flowing
with
carbonation
very
quickly
the
most
of
the
head
goes
away
but
theres
a
thin
layer
that
stays
behind
the
color
is
a
nice
orangeybrowntan
color
thats
cloudy
the
smell
is
deep
farmhouse
sour
flavors
from
horse
blanket
to
lemon
and
grapefruit
the
taste
is
pretty
mellow
for
a
gueuze
a
good
blend
not
overpowering
with
sourness
but
not
mellow
enough
to
let
you
forget
youre
drinking
a
gueuze
the
mouthfeel
is
acidic
carbonated
and
dry
its
like
drinking
champaign
lemon
juice
opinion
boy
you
just
dont
come
across
a
beer
like
this
too
often
and
this
is
the
reason
why
i
like
the
gueuze
styles
so
much
there
are
so
many
flavors
in
here
i
barely
do
it
justice
by
comparing
it
to
lemonade
but
that
is
where
my
mind
goes
when
drinking
this
beer
it
is
light
and
refreshing
with
lots
of
citrus
and
carbonation
it
goes
down
really
smooth
but
i
imagine
that
the
acidity
would
get
the
best
of
you
if
you
drank
a
whole
lot
of
this
beer
d
this
one
has
me
totally
rethinking
my
outlook
on
beer
being
my
first
gueuze
i
really
dont
know
what
to
say
i
wouldnt
call
this
incredibly
drinkable
as
its
definitely
a
challenging
beer
to
consume
at
the
same
time
forming
a

head
over
the
cloudy
golden
amber
brew
head
fades
gradually
but
slowly
ill
try
some
more
of
the
style
its
right
up
my
alley
you
have
to
try
this
if
you
see

i
can
verbalize
this
is
a
lambic

as
the
high

tart
factors
will
repel
the
uninitiated
i
ate
dates
wrapped
in

with
this
and
it
balances
with
the
salty
sweetness
so
well
i
almost
wept
those
that
find
most

lambics
cloying
and
crave
the
most

this
is
it
this
is
an
elite
beer
for
an
experienced

and
once
youve
had
this

will

bitter
after
having
waited
for
this
for
a
while
im
a
bit
disappointed
in
the
result
this
beer
is
too
sweet
and
the
funky
oaky
woody
tartness
is
almost
completely
missing
id
revisit
an
older
vintage
just
to
make
sure
theres
nothing
here
but
otherwise
the
black
label
is
strictly
better
bottle
375ml
clear
golden
pour
with
decent
white
head
aroma
is
too
light
barnyard
and
leather
hay
but
mostly
green
apples
light
tartness
and
wood
sweet
apples
and
leaf
nice
carbonation
lacks
authenticity
but
still
enjoyable
a
shadow
of
the
black
label
deep
orange
colour
fairly
dense
ring
of
white
head
some
lace
smell
is
of
cheese
quite
funky
a
bit
of
blasmaic
and
wine
quite
acidic
witha
bit
of
lemon

it
as

with

medium

medium
bodied
a
fairly
nice
gueuze
the
nose
is
a
bit
off
putting
initially
but
overall
its
quite
drinkable
hazy
reddish
brown
voluminous
white
head
great
lace
and
light

nose
of
old
cheese
woody
earthy
malty
vinegar
and
white
wine
taste
of
tart
apple
juice
lemons
dark
bread
malty
and
although
still
cheesy
is
less
so
than
the
nose
denser
and
maltier
than
i
had
anticipated
tartness
is
medium
cheesier
than
i
wouldve
liked
but
still
interesting
to
try
o
definitely
not
my
favorite
and
a
disappointment
compared
to
black
label
drinkable
but
not
pleasant
overall
very
different
than
the
others
in
the
style
the
added
sweetness
really
didnt
do
this
any
good
as
the
resulting
ginger
is
quite
offputting
not
something
i
ever
want
to
lay
eyes
on
again
easily
the
worst
of
the
lineup
was
glad
to
introduce
this
to
drain
dark
orange
and
transparent
with
a
big
creamy
white
head
that
rises
above
the
liquid
about
two
inches
scattered
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
lemon
barnyard
and
a
light
mustiness
its
really
toned
down
from
the
black
label
theres
a
little
oak
the
flavor
possesses
a
simple
lactic
sourness
with
a
mellow
tartness
lightly
oaky
and
citric
with
a
little
leather
and
barnyard
but
the
filtering
seems
to
have
stripped
this
beer
of
positive
attributes
and
turned
it
into
gueuze
light
the
beer
is
lower
medium
body
with
high
carbonation
an
okay
beer
in
its
own
right
but
pales
in
comparison
to
the
black
label
thanks
eric
for
the
opportunity
to
try
this
overall
this
beer
can
be
best
described
as
simple
and
good
but
not
great
overall
not
my
style
but
on
the
better
end
of
it
light
body
with
crisp
carbonation
and
mild
acidity
decent
enough
but
nowhere
near
what
the
black
label
is
o
so
this
is
what
a
real
gueuze
albeit
filtered
tastes
like
a
very
mature
stepup
for
me
in
my
gueuze
education
thats
for
sure
not
crazy
sour
like
the
cantillon
bio
definitely
something
i
see
myself
breaking
out
on
special
occasions
would
definitely
work
well
as
a
before
or
after
dinner
drink
or
even
during
dinner
drink
who
am
i
kidding
cant
wait
to
try
the
black
label
to
see
the
difference
o
pity
one
weakest
geuze
i
know
finish
is
bright
green
spice
sour
lemonlemonade
and
undertones
of
funky
honey
nice
beer
over
all
and
a
great
flavor
profile
for
food
overall
the
filtration
didnt
improve
the
beer
the
refermentation
process
in
the
bottle
making
the
beer
more
acidic
clearly
is
missing
here
still
a
very
decent
geuze
o
an
odd
ball
not
likely
to
revisit
for
a
while
especially
given
the
superior
girardin
black
the
palate
opens
quite
sharp
quite
unlike
anything
i
was
expecting
given
the
nose
super
sharp
very
sweet
limelike
almost
artificially
so
with
some
grass
in
this
regard
its
unique
ive
had
grapefruit
or
lemon
forward
gueuzes
but
this
sweet
lime
flavor
is
the
first
that
i
remember
a
little
sour
cider
is
present
as
well
again
theres
quite
a
strong
cheesiness
but
the
fact
that
this
is
filtered
takes
away
from
the
complexity
making
this
aspect
stand
rather
alone
without
really
lingering
light
in
body
this
finish
crisp
along
with
a
little
aspirin
a
little
floral
character
particularly
some
rose
solid
stuff
this
is
a
very
approachable
gueuze
that
i
wouldnt
be
afraid
to
give
to
a
lambic
virgin
overall
it
is
a
pretty
good
gueuze
nice
drinkability
on
this
one
similar
to
the
black
label
but
it
had
distinguishable
differences
i
am
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
this
is
not
a
hard
or
aggressive
lambic
but
neither
is
the
black
label
the
acidity
is
quite
refreshing
though
may
be
a
bit
challenging
for
the
lambic
initiate
and
the
funkiness
is
fairly
restrained
compared
to
some
this
makes
for
a
clean
gueueze
that
still
seems
to
be
chock
full
of
traditional
lambic
flavors
an
interesting
beer
some
of
the
character
was
quite
unexpected
the
dark
color
the
ham
in
the
aroma
and
the
oxidation
overall
i
would
guess
this
is
directly
attributable
to
the
filtration
and
nonbottle
conditioning
but
am
not
100
sure
this
is
certainly
a
far
cry
from
the
excellence
achieved
by
the
black
label
gueuze
though
it
is
certainly
still
enjoyable
i
am
quite
happy
to
finally
be
drinking
this
bottle
it
is
something
i
have
wanted
to
try
for
quite
some
time
but
have
lacked
the
necessary
motivation
to
actually
try
and
track
down
i
will
likely
never
get
one
of
these
again
especially
if
any
other
decent
gueuze
is
available
this
beer
was
really
smooth
incredibly
for
the
style
and
would
be
easy
to
get
quite
a
few
down
in
a
night
as
it
is
not
overly
acidic
thanks
kevin
poured
quite
a
dark
clear
amber
no
yeast
in
the
bottom
as
this
is
filtered
unlike
the
black
nose
was
sweet
and
sour
some
toffee
that
i
initially
characterized
as
butterscotch
sweet
notes
were
held
in
check
well
by
all
the
funky
sour
elements
sour
in
the
mouth
but
with
a
sweet
quality
that
most
of
the
other
sours
we
sampled
did
not
have
sweetness
came
of
as
toffee
mostly
more
malt
than
a
traditional
lambic
medium
low
carbonation
thin
body
ciderlike
at
times
this
filtered
gueuze
appears
a
clear
orange
hue
with
a
white
foamy
head
that
has
great
staying
power
and
leaves
an
ample
amount
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
consists
of
sour
and
funk
though
more
muted
than
in
a
3f
or
cantillon
gueuze
the
beer
is
fruity
and
has
a
very
present
sweet
flavor
to
it
this
is
quite
unexpected
the
beer
is
very
bright
with
a
balancing
act
of
sour
and
sweet
the
funky
barn
flavor
is
there
but
it
only
has
a
costarring
role
there
is
a
pleasant
sour
green
apple
flavor
to
this
beer
the
feel
is
decent
with
an
appropriate
amount
of
carbonation
the
finish
doesnt
make
me
pucker
the
way
i
was
expecting
and
hoping
this
is
a
good
offering
and
certainly
a
bit
of
a
departure
from
the
norm
the
beer
is
super
bright
on
the
palate
tons
of
carbonation
in
the
mouth
there
is
some
tartness
sourness
to
it
but
its
also
sweet
in
the
juxtaposition
between
the
two
girardin
beers
thats
what
stood
out
the
most
to
me
its
quite
good
my
wife
loved
it
a
great
novelty
but
the
black
wins
in
my
book
i
would
definitely
drink
this
beer
again
in
the
future
and
i
have
more
of
it
so
i
am
looking
forward
to
that
a
very
nice
and
interesting
gueuze
but
be
aware
that
this
one
is
sweeter
than
youll
expect
kind
of
like
a
baby
faro
not
nearly
that
sweet
though
dvery
sweet
with
some
issues
one
dimensional
and
a
little
cidar
like
had
next
to
some
tasty
gueuze
and
was
the
least
complex
of
the
group
and
just
was
too
sweet
d
tried
this
one
in
a
line
up
of
other
sours
and
i
wasnt
too
upset
when
my
glass
was
finished
and
we
moved
on
to
the
next
still
a
very
good
beer
pours
into
a
basic
bar
tumble
a
crystal
clear
gold
that
leans
toward
yellow
with
a
white
airy
head
retention
is
decent
but
it
eventually
settles
to
a
pretty
lacing
aroma
is
quite
bready
with
plenty
of
green
apple
touches
of
gym
socks
and
a
lemony
finish
quite
crisp
and
refreshing
with
moderate
tartness
and
sourness
that
doesnt
nearly
reach
that
of
the
black
label
flavor
follows
the
aroma
closely
with
small
amounts
of
barnyard
apple
cider
vinegar
and
a
bit
of
grapefruit
at
the
end
quite
pleasant
and
drinkable
though
i
prefer
the
intensity
of
the
black
label
d
not
a
bad
gueuze
clean
and
refreshing
easy
to
drink
not
as
demanding
or
assertive
as
some
gueuzes
not
as
sweet
as
others
had
a
bottle
at
the
troll
cellar
in
ghent
this
is
very
different
from
the
black
label
and
well
worth
dirnking
side
by
side
but
the
black
is
a
more
typical
ripping
gueze
this
is
totally
different
and
a
big
change
of
pace
with
low
tartness
and
more
bready
cheesey
flavors
instead
of
sour
fruit
definitely
worth
a
try
taste
is
super
puckering
with
more
of
that
cheesiness
woody
super
balance
in
this
once
theres
a
nice
maltiness
keeping
it
in
check
a
bit
carbonation
is
zippy
and
its
extremely
dry
this
is
a
superb
beer
and
probably
the
best
example
of
the
style
ive
had
yet
exquisite
pours
a
clear
orange
brown

still

the

and
the

is
pretty
close
to

the
fact
that
this
version
is
supposed
to
be
inferior
to
the
unfiltered
version
make
me
crave
the

even
more

thanks
mads
i
didnt
try
the
black
when
i
went
back
to
bierkoning
i
forgot
to
get
a
bottle
which
i
regret
because
im
sure
its
even
better
than
this
filtered
white
label
which
is
fantastic
straw
yellow
extremely
clear
nice
pure
white
cover
of
sticky
foam
and
frankly
hypocrite
appearance
since
the
beer
is
terrific
aroma
reminds
me
of
blue
cheese
its
horsey
and
barnyardy
like
any
gueuze
that
respects
itself
a
good
dose
of
hay
and
old
books
alike
mustiness
claims
its
seriousness
the
addition
of
fruity
undertones
which
i
couldnt
name
besides
the
cidery
apples
old
socks
and
leather
makes
it
a
contender
against
the
big
boys
admirable
clean
dryness
just
enough
acidity
incredibly
soft
malt
base
rediculously
soft
carbonation
as
lovely
as
a
flower
that
smells
the
wet
horse
can
be
give
me
some
of
that
black
label
will
you
thanks
martin
well
after
having
this
i
thought
it
really
couldnt
get
much
better
in
terms
of
gueuze
lambic
that
was
until
i
had
the
black
label
unfiltered
version
this
is
still
world
class
lambic
all
the
lambic
stinkyness
is
there
and
the
acidity
but
it
falls
short
in
terms
of
complexity
in
comparison
to
the
black
label
still
bloody
good
and
id
take
this
ale
any
day
of
the
week
juicy
earthy
grassy
simply
wonderful
whitelabel
is
a
unique
gueuze
in
the
lambic
world
a
commercial
gueuze
from
a
traditional
producer
if
you
ever
get
chance
to
try
the
whitelabel
i
would
do
so
but
even
better
if
you
can
drink
it
alongside
the
blacklabel
offering
this
is
highly
recommended
for
you
will
surely
learn
a
hell
of
a
lot
more
about
traditional
gueuze
by
doing
this
than
reading
all
the
gueuze
beer
reviews
on
this
site
after
all
experience
is
everything
when
drinking
lambics
pour
is
amber
orange
with
a
small
amount
of
tight
white
head

faint

somewhat

a

carb
okay
but
not
getting
a
lot
of
oak
out
of
it
bottle
from
tipples
pours
deep
golden
with
a
bit
of
orange
and
a
small
fizzy
head
on
top
aroma
of
big
time
sour
funk
acid
oak
some
sweet
fruits
like
peaches
and
apples
mmmm
taste
is
bold
and
has
plenty
of
malt
sweetness
light
fruits
add
depth
and
there
is
plenty
of
sour
funk
to
go
around
nice
dry
oaky
tannins
body
is
on
the
heavier
side
for
the
style
with
plenty
of
lively
prickly
carbonation
and
a
dry
finish
this
is
really
nice
and
maybe
it
would
be
best
side
by
side
with
the
regular
version
overall
i
think
i
liked
the
regular
version
a
bit
better
perhaps
a
little
more
age
would
funk
this
up
dry
it
out
and
lighten
things
up
a
bit
but
nevertheless
this
is
yummy
yellow
and
clear
odor
very
similar
to
the
products
which
we
have
tilquin
cheese
pickled
cucumbers
cabbage
no
kidding
with
the
exception
that
all
kind
of
more
intense
taste
is
also
intense
for
at
oude
gueuze
tilquin
is
more
expressive
beer
moderately
saturated
but
one
gets
the
impression
that
you
are
drinking
sparkling
wine
just
outstanding
i
cant
say
to
have
any
expertise
on
the
actual
aging
potential
of
gueuzes
but
this
seems
primed
to
have
a
lengthy
and
excellent
lifespan
aroma
is
outstanding
full
of
sweaty
horseblanket
and
stone
fruit
notes
with
a
touch
of
vanilla
its
got
a
deep
mustiness
already
on
the
palate
this
is
revealed
to
largely
be
a
product
of
the
big
oak
flavors
revealing
a
slightly
sweet
and
deeply
tannic
profile
as
the
brett
works
over
time
and
dries
this
out
i
have
hopes
of
true
magnificence
but
if
it
never
does
anything
but
get
progressively
older
ill
still
enjoy
this
a
fair
bit
more
than
the
regular
a
decent
head
that
falls
moderately
quickly
hints
of
a
pastel
yellow
in
the
lace
body
is
slightly
cloudy
and
a
gorgeous
pale
orange
color
aroma
is
strong
and
filled
with
tart
lemon
and
a
little
sweetness
to
it
not
any
funkiness
but
maybe
a
little
dry
dust
and
a
slight
burn
taste
is
not
what
i
remember
from
the
last
bottle
i
had
a
weird
sour
bitterness
that
i
pick
up
on
the
back
of
my
tongue
more
lemon
and
a
little
orange
peel
some
green
apple
tons
of
oak
and
the
alcohol
is
there
in
the
background
mouth
is
a
little
light
bodied
but
carb
is
good
overall
i
enjoy
it
but
miss
the
funkiness
of
other
gueuze
this
is
more
citrus
rind
than
musty
goodness
the
palate
opens
with
a
big
juicy
sourness
earthy
lemony
grapefruity
and
with
faint
melon
characteristics
the
mid
palate
brings
out
the
barrel
character
with
deep
woody
tannins
mildly
woodsy
mild
vanillin
and
a
mild
pear
preserve
note
layered
and
structured
the
finish
brings
out
some
salty
and
mushroomy
flavors
before
the
tannins
take
over
leaving
a
long
drying
finish
sour
with
preserved
lemons
grapefruit
a
mild
vinegar
character
the
strong
oak
tannins
on
the
finish
remind
me
of
some
unblended
lambics
broucsella
and
maybe
the
boon
mariage
parfait
alcohol
is
reasonably
well
hidden
this
beer
is
light
in
body
moderately
carbonated
and
and
fantastic
on
the
palate
excellent
im
not
sure
this
should
be
cellared
drink
it
fresh
if
you
have
it
on
hand
better
than
cantillon
give
it
a
blind
tasting
with
virtually
any
from
their
line
and
prepare
to
be
surprised
could
easily
age
for
another
decade
if
it
is
anything
like
drie
fonteinen
vintage
what
a
drink
it
will
be
then
final
score
4
49
verdict
a
very
nice
beer
though
i
did
find
myself
noticing
the
alcohol
sometimes
on
the
palate
other
times
at
the
finish
which
i
didnt
enjoy
so
much
its
not
as
bright
or
as
delicate
as
its
mathematical
root
beer
but
its
still
an
extremely
well
blended
gueuze
with
the
soft
underpinnings
of
wheat
a
delicate
bread
character
bounces
against
the
highly
piquant
textures
alcohols
and
wood
spice
to
give
the
ale
a
tepid
sense
of
balance
still
its
peppery
and
vinous
character
crispens
the
taste
and
dries
the
palate
with
utter
ease
its
a
wild
taste
and
meant
for
the
most
serious
of
connoisseur
its
simply
a
drinkers
beer
overall
really
good
stuff
the
extended
aging
definitely
adds
lots
of
additional
funk
and
oak
character
worth
picking
up
if
you
find
it
musky
as
hell
but
very
good
cool
story
on
this
one
thanks
to
my
brother
for
scoring
this
one
i
liked
it
even
better
than
the
base
gueuze
which
obviously
is
one
of
the
pace
cars
for
the
style
this
one
has
a
lot
more
wood
on
it
a
lot
more
bubbles
and
is
frankly
way
more
sour
and
acidic
without
sacrificing
any
of
its
funk
maybe
the
extended
time
with
high
carbonation
has
added
that
usually
unwelcome
carbonic
acid
to
the
mix
its
not
an
off
flavor
or
feel
here
it
cuts
the
coarse
wheat
malt
and
ancient
oak
very
cool
on
the
palate
with
the
lacto
sourness
to
and
a
citrus
quality
i
dont
remember
in
the
base
beer
the
abv
is
higher
but
i
still
dont
taste
it
what
i
taste
is
a
maturity
despite
its
lively
carbonation
its
decadent
one
to
let
warm
up
and
open
and
highly
tannic
like
an
acidic
white
wine
the
oak
flavor
is
raw
to
me
unsweetened
not
charred
not
vanilla
just
wood
a
very
developed
yeast
profile
is
what
i
get
in
the
finish
and
its
not
like
other
belgian
blended
sours
its
sharp
and
old
at
the
same
time
like
a
guy
turning
100
years
old
who
wields
a
cane
not
as
a
crutch
but
as
a
weapon
and
who
is
as
mentally
sharp
as
he
ever
was
this
has
that
spry
longevity
to
it
and
i
super
dig
it
i
hope
it
comes
back
around
bitter
pink
grapefruit
firmly
sour
dry
tannic
oak
in
the
aftertaste
a
touch
more
intense
than
the
oude
gueuze
a
bit
oakier
for
sure
smooth
and
crisp
the
firm
tannic
bitterness
lingers
overall
its
very
similar
but
slightly
different
than
the
oude
gueuze
definitely
worth
a
try

not
the
most
sour
but
who
cares
the
brett
notes
are
fantastic
glowing
golden
yellow
capped
with
a
slender
creamy
ring
complex
funky
aromas
of
flowers
general
barnyard
cheese
apple
lemon
and
dried

keeps
the
funk
up
with
flowers
earth
and
mustiness
fruity
sweet

acetic
wood
and
lemon
perfectly
dry
and
tart
attacking
the
gumline
and
making
it
hard
to
pace
myself
for
a
strong
gueuze
this
stays
insanely
light
and
drinkable
very
happy
i
found
a
bottle
of
this
another
excellent
one
tilquin
i
may
prefer
the
original
but
this
is
still
great
overall
just
a
great
gueuze
this
might
be
one
of
the
best
base
gueuzes
that
ive
ever
come
across
get
it
while
you
can
before
others
catch
on
immensely
drinkable
amazing
gueuze
pours
a
hazy
orange
with
a
slight
head
if
poured
correctly
smell
of
acidic
goodness
that
is
quite
reminiscent
of
regular
tilquin
taste
is
very
similar
as
well
but
dare
i
say
a
tad
better
body
is
fuller
and
the
flavors
are
more
pronounced
big
acidity
but
thats
what
you
get
from
the
og
version
too
booziness
not
detectable
imo
a
slight
improvement
to
an
already
terrific
gueuze
this
in
my
eyes
is
one
of
the
best
gueuzes
you
can
buy
in
the
usa
and
one
you
should
snag
off
the
shelves
before
it
becomes
too
popular
great
job
mouthfeel
signature
chalky

a
good
way

some

very
dry
overall
a
decent
brew
and
shared
w
my
brother
who
had
never
had
anything
like
it
this
is
excellence
so
beatiful
and
great
taste
just
love
it
super
drinkability
i
sure
this
would
be
interesting
with
some
age
on
it
taste
delivered
didnt
quite
deliver
in
other
areas
pours
a
burnt
orange
into
my
tulip
thin
white
head
lingers
for
a
while
smells
of
hay
lactic
acid
some
lemons
and
slight
acetone
spew
out
of
the
glass
the
first
sip
is
an
explosion
of
tart
funk
all
over
the
mouth
some
lemons
and
lactic
acid
linger
before
vanishing
the
finish
is
pretty
clean
there
is
a
muted
tartness
that
can
be
perceived
but
the
finish
is
quite
quick
prickly
on
the
tongue
and
a
little
thin
i
might
not
favor
this
to
the
same
extent
that
fans
of
the
style
do
but
this
was
tasty
worth
trying
as
a
reference
point
for
gueuze
beers
dont
waste
your
time
hunting
lpg
this
might
be
better
and
much
easier
to
find
this
is
a
nice
damn
brew
not
much
more
to
say
overall
solid
a
great
example
of
the
style
balanced
and
nicely
funky
pours
a
golden
hue
with
a
fair
amount
of
head
smells
funky
sour
musty
and
earthy
taste
is
sour
and
acidic
reminescient
of
yogurt
notes
of
tartness
maybe
lemon
oak
and
vinegar
mouthful
is
light
and
very
carbonated
overall
an
awesome
sour
that
will
clean
a
palate
barnyard
funk
and
pleasantly
tart
mmm
d
this
was
a
slight
gusher
and
began
with
too
much
carbonation
the
nose
and
flavors
are
complex
and
delicious
over
time
the
carbonation
settled
making
this
beer
extremely
drinkable
and
probably
the
best
gueuze
i
have
had
flavors
take
you
on
a
roller
coaster
ride
of
bright
and
earthy
sweet
and
tart
o
magnificent
there
arent
many
beers
with
this
sort
of
depth
it
looks
fantastic
while
the
aroma
and
flavour
are
incredible
sour
funky
and
dry
with
hints
of
yeast
and
grain
excellent
body
challenging
but
rewarding
this
is
the
pinnicle
of
belgian
brewing
and
possibly
the
best
lambic
ive
had
yet
the
balance
is
superb
this
is
a
worldclass
brew
that
deserves
to
be
added
to
your
musttry
list
cant
ask
for
more
in
a
beer
a
well
balanced
lambic
as
none
of
the
flavor
notes
are
overpowering
each
takes
its
turn
on
your
palate
and
youre
left
with
a
refreshing
beverage
a
very
solid
representation
of
what
i
understand
the
style
to
be
this
pour
was
a
tad
expensive
so
have
to
consider
that
for
future
purchases
but
this
should
stay
on
my
radar
since
i
see
bottles
at
my
local
shops
o
beautiful
it
doesnt
get
much
better
than
this
for
a
gueuze
colour
yellow
cloudy
white
head
but
delicate
light
coral
beer
aroma
slightly
fruity
the
taste
of
cucumber
apple
lemon
some
bitter
and
sour
tart
heavily
saturated
not
for
everybody
super
this
is
highly
excellent
its
nice
that
its
much
easier
to
get
than
some
of
the
big
guys
taste
more
of
the
same
no
way
i
can
explain
a
geueze
and
make
it
sound
it
good
but
this
is
so
tasty
much
like
the
nose
mostly
dry
and
damn
good
begins
slightly
sour
with
a
notable
fruitiness
of
lemon
rind
and
unripe
peach
also
musty
yeast
which
helps
to
keeo
the
beer
in
balance
then
sour
dry
acidity
becomes
more
and
more
detectable
it
hits
the
palate
in
an
intense
but
refreshing
way
the
sourness
in
this
gueuze
goes
through
different
stages
on
the
palate
at
first
defined
by
a
subtle
fruitiness
then
with
slick
yeast
and
soft
yogurt
notes
to
finish
with
a
dry
tart
aftertaste
the
taste
is
great
lots
of
wild
yeast
flavor
with
a
somewhat
lemony
taste
with
slight
hint
of
wood
in
the
backend
which
brings
a
subtle
tannic
or
spice
to
the
flavor
with
mild
malt
which
seems
dry
on
the
palate
with
herbal
element
and
sour
flavor
the
most
dominant
into
the
smooth
relatively
dry
finish
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
both
on
draft
at
moeder
and
this
bottle
which
had
20122013
on
the
neck
label
very
vibrant
and
a
joy
to
drink
overall
its
a
very
good
gueuze
that
already
tastes
like
it
has
a
good
deal
of
age
on
it
while
its
possible
to
drink
it
fresh
it
has
a
best
before
date
of
08012024
on
the
bottle
i
will
revisit
this
beer
somewhere
down
the
line
when
it
has
aged
out
some
more
that
popcorn
flavor
and
aroma
is
very
strange
it
doesnt
taste
bad
it
just
tastes
odd
unaged
i
would
not
drink
another
bottle
o
i
very
rarely
get
to
drink
gueuze
so
to
find
a
renowned
example
and
have
the
whole
bottle
to
myself
was
pretty
exciting
this
is
a
beer
that
a
lot
of
people
would
try
and
say
this
is
beer
i
let
a
couple
people
sip
this
and
that
was
the
exact
reaction
i
got
its
very
brisk
refreshing
and
seems
simple
and
complex
at
the
same
time
each
taste
felt
new
i
dont
love
it
but
i
think
its
a
fantastic
beer
overall
really
good
stuff
there
is
a
grapefruit
pith
type
flavour
that
keeps
its
tart
and
refreshing
maybe
not
a
whole
lot
of
complexity
but
still
an
interesting
beer
to
drink
one
of
the
better
gueuzes
ive
had
o
4
5
this
is
a
very
tame
yet
complex
lambic
a
definite
classic
flavor
profile
but
a
little
too
smooth
and
clean
i
couldnt
wait
to
drink
this
but
thats
most
likely
my
problem
it
will
definitely
improve
with
age
but
a
must
have
without
to
truly
get
a
feel
for
this
amazing
lambic
a
definite
must
try
rating
is
based
on
batch
1
from
20102011
also
had
20122013
sidebyside
which
was
also
nice
but
not
quite
as
good
as
the
older
iteration
both
poured
from
bottle
into
gueuze
glass
at
monks
in
philadelphia
nice
vibrant
and
hazy
golden
aromas
of
sweat
blue
cheese
funk
mild
black
pepper
and
a
strong
tartness
high
carbonation
juicy
flavors
and
moderately
drying
very
nice
overall
not
my
favorite
gueuze
but
still
an
amazing
beer
overall
this
is
pretty
fantastic
gueuze
its
right
up
there
with
cantillon
and
3f
if
this
had
just
a
bit
more
funk
or
complex
notes
it
would
put
this
gueuze
over
the
top
maybe
one
day
theyll
stock
this
on
the
shelves
in
texas
so
i
can
buy
it
all
o
4
5
a
lot
of
classic
gueuze
flavors
going
on
in
this
beer
and
overall
done
very
well
it
could
be
a
bit
more
sour
in
my
opinion
but
ill
age
one
for
a
while
and
see
how
it
develops
osuperb
in
the
style
a
pleasure
to
drink
so
glad
we
have
distro
on
this
now
o
a
very
layered
and
complex
gueuze
that
i
wish
i
could
try
next
to
some
of
the
other
well
known
lambic
blenders
this
seemed
less
acidic
and
bright
than
the
drie
fonteinen
oude
geuze
overall
recommended
and
worth
cellaring
to
see
what
time
will
bring
brings
a
wide
variety
of
weird
funky
and
sour
flavors
to
the
table
oan
intense
gueuze
packed
more
punch
that
i
anticipated
i
was
happy
with
this
i
was
expecting
something
less
authentic
so
this
was
nice
poured
into
teku
perfect
blend
of
sourness
creamy
mouth
and
low
heat
wonderfully
drinkable
and
not
too
tart
still
the
sourness
does
come
through
and
doesnt
disappoint
a
nice
lingering
sour
aftertaste
as
well
doesnt
seem
overly
dry
to
me
instead
it
has
a
crispness
to
it
if
anything
any
dryness
is
subtle
excellent
representation
of
this
style
never
disappoints
o
definite
9
out
of
10
from
me
excellent
on
all
accounts
to
know
boon
and
cantillons
lambics
amongst
other
great
breweries
are
in
this
makes
me
appreciate
it
all
the
more
i
found
this
in
whole
foods
birmingham
al
and
am
drinking
it
in
hopkinsville
ky
an
excellent
complex
and
balanced
gueuze
im
sure
tilquin
will
soon
be
in
the
ranks
of
cantillon
and
drie
fonteinen
o
nice
sour
balanced
between
sour
and
fruitiness
brilliant
golden
color
with
almost
no
head
aroma
is
lactic
acetic
and
earthy
with
a
toasted
oak
character
theres
almost
a
blue
cheese
sharp
funk
to
it
flavor
reveals
sour
cherry
notes
along
with
a
clean
acetic
and
lactic
character
that
dries
nicely
in
the
finish
and
becomes
slightly
barnyardphenolic
very
impressive
in
the
sourness
that
erupts
and
fades
cleansing
the
palate
perfectly
o
a
little
over
exuberant
on
the
sourness
lots
of
complexity
of
both
bright
and
mellow
flavors
but
you
really
have
to
work
to
get
through
all
that
tanginess
hazy
amber
golden
pour
with
quickly
reducing
bubbly
white
head
pungent
aroma
of
barnyard
funk
grass
and
hay
sweet
peach
and
grape
lemon
peel
aromas
carry
through
to
the
taste
coats
the
tongue
with
malty
sweetness
and
fruit
flavor
peach
orange
bright
lemon
peel
mixed
with
earthy
funk
and
lactic
acidity
that
dries
out
towards
the
end
in
oaky
tannins
the
finish
has
a
nice
lemon
peel
pop
i
like
in
a
geueze
but
the
finish
is
marred
by
some
astringent
bitterness
like
biting
into
a
pill
i
opened
up
a
201213
when
it
fresher
and
it
wasnt
quite
ready
yet
its
now
coming
together
nicely
and
may
benefit
from
a
little
more
time
this
is
a
great
gueuze
that
is
easier
to
find
but
not
quite
as
good
as
3f
or
cantillon
o
excellent
drinkability
excellent
gueuze
classic
o
big
funky
and
sour
gueuze
for
sure
very
funky
like
chewing
bilesoaked
leather
at
times
acidity
is
extremely
high
to
boot
not
bad
but
a
little
too
funky
for
me
the
body
is
medium
and
theres
a
certain
creaminess
to
it
even
with
the
dryness
it
is
also
though
very
crisp
and
bright
its
extremely
refreshing
acidic
without
being
harshly
astringent
with
a
powdery
and
clean
finish
even
as
the
puckering
sourness
makes
it
a
little
juicy
and
carbonation
is
nearly
perfect
drinkability
its
a
very
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
with
great
flavors
and
aromas
world
class
geuze
this
is
a
good
gueuze
but
i
dont
feel
it
ranks
up
near
cantillon
or
3f
golden
blend
for
pure
overall
taste
and
experience
nothing
tilquin
does
here
is
poor
but
only
the
mouthfeel
stands
out
as
truly
superb
worth
a
try
a
more
restrained
beer
than
drie
fonteinen
as
i
had
two
blind
still
absolutely
delicious
though
overall
sophistication
putting
this
in
my
chambers
more
of
a
wild
ale
session
but
all
in
all
quite
enjoyable
gueuzes
typically
exhibit
a
rounded
profile
of
tartness
funk
oak
and
barnyard
character
even
with
two
years
of
age
this
beer
was
a
bitter
pithy
sour
bomb
it
reminded
me
more
of
an
overhopped
american
wild
ale
than
any
type
of
gueuze
i
have
ever
sampled
total
3950
overall
an
excellent
representation
of
the
style
love
it
o
really
great
representation
of
the
style
and
the
bottle
is
affordable
on
a
parttime
work
budget
would
like
to
find
another
one
to
age
o
fantastic
beer
wish
i
could
find
it
around
more
overall
very
funky
beer
with
an
unusually
high
drinkability
pricey
but
worth
repeating
nice
to
still
be
able
to
at
least
occasionally
find
a
good
gueuze
and
this
is
definitely
a
good
one
the
popularity
of
sours
in
this
country
has
soared
making
beers
like
this
harder
and
harder
to
fine
pours
a
dark
straw
color
with
a
fine
white
head
that
thins
and
then
settles
to
a
ring
nice
tart
aromas
of
green
apples
and
a
vinegar
tang
as
well
as
some
light
hay
and
the
tiniest
bit
of
barnyard
funk
much
less
than
in
some
others
thankfully
no
bandaid
the
taste
is
a
bit
more
complex
with
all
of
the
elements
found
in
the
nose
present
along
with
a
vinous
quality
and
some
nice
minerality
still
not
a
lot
of
funk
but
long
complex
sour
flavors
with
a
touch
of
bitterness
and
a
slightly
soft
finish
very
nice
indeed
i
dont
drink
cider
and
i
certainly
dont
drink
old
sour
dry
cider
that
a
vinegar
fly
has
got
into
it
reminded
me
of
that
o
i
like
this
beer
taste
is
pretty
malty
especially
when
the
sourness
passes
very
easy
drinking
overall
worth
a
try
glad
i
checked
it
off
my
list
tilquin
blends
a
good
gueuze
it
really
showcases
my
favorite
aspects
of
the
style
minerality
and
bright
lemon
acidity
its
tart
and
puckering
complex
and
easy
drinking
its
great
to
be
able
to
grab
a
gueuze
of
this
quality
whenever
you
feel
like
it
a
bottle
of
the
20112012
at
750
ml
a
big
spritzy
head
that
stays
but
doesnt
leave
much
on
the
side
of
my
glass
beer
stays
covered
all
the
way
through
cloudy
golden
amber
with
a
visible
amount
of
carbonation
going
on
nose
is
superb
and
hits
all
the
notes
in
the
scale
of
greatness
wine
hay
grass
vinegar
oak
funk
pale
malt
faint
honey
and
the
list
can
continue
taste
is
ridiculous
supremely
balanced
with
lots
of
tart
acidic
notes
that
follow
a
surprisingly
malty
front
oak
is
big
but
not
overwhelming
as
it
seems
to
bind
the
malt
and
vinous
elements
together
into
an
amazing
whole
the
honey
from
the
nose
flows
ever
so
gently
underneath
it
all
carrying
the
flavors
to
a
firm
but
not
overpoweringly
sour
and
dry
finish
oh
there
is
quite
a
pucker
but
one
that
takes
you
back
to
the
glass
for
more
and
more
its
almost
addictively
good
feel
is
silky
and
vigorously
creamy
in
its
carbonation
the
weight
is
perfectly
balanced
and
combined
with
the
other
seductive
qualities
of
this
beer
i
found
myself
seasoning
what
should
have
been
a
sipper
sipping
this
one
is
an
act
of
incredible
self
restraint
i
had
this
with
amy
favorite
cheese
and
my
wife
who
is
not
a
big
fan
of
sours
joined
me

the
hearty

and
very

on
with
the
moderate

a
highly
enjoyable
offering
overall
i
thought
thought
this
was
a
very
nice
beer
and
even
with
my
very
limited
experience
with
this
style
im
still
pretty
sure
that
this
is
a
good
example
of
the
style
i
liked
that
the
sourness
was
almost
at
the
edge
of
being
too
sour
but
it
wasnt
super
acidic
and
that
made
it
easier
to
drink
than
i
expected
this
beer
had
nice
drinkability
i
sipped
on
it
faster
than
i
i
expected
it
was
fairly
smooth
clean
crisp
not
too
acidic
not
to
filling
and
the
taste
did
a
nice
job
at
holding
my
attention
but
i
think
one
of
these
375ml
bottles
would
be
my
limit
i
think
it
would
start
to
wear
one
me
if
i
had
more
than
that
what
i
liked
the
most
about
this
beer
was
that
it
wasnt
overly
sour
and
overly
acidic
i
think
both
were
at
a
good
level
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
the
appearance
it
wasnt
bad
i
just
wish
there
was
some
decent
head
and
lacing
i
would
get
this
beer
again
its
a
little
expensive
but
i
think
its
nice
to
have
for
special
occasions
and
i
would
recommend
it
to
anyone
who
likes
sour
beers
all
in
all
i
was
pretty
happy
with
this
beer
i
didnt
fully
know
what
to
expect
from
this
beer
but
it
turned
out
to
be
something
i
enjoyed
and
im
glad
i
took
a
chance
on
it
it
made
for
a
nice
beer
to
have
for
my
800th
review
im
for
sure
interested
in
trying
more
beers
from
this
brewery
and
more
gueuzes
great
job
guys
this
was
a
very
nice
and
memorable
beer
keep
up
the
great
work
a
complex
and
elegant
blend
very
tasty
very
well
made
and
on
the
money
for
style
o
overall
a
world
class
shelf
gueuze
lets
hope
the
cat
stays
in
the
bag
on
this
one
so
it
stays
gettable
overall
a
very
good
beer
the
scent
is
amazing
but
the
taste
does
not
quite
match
altogether
a
well
blended
gueuze
that
i
would
recommend
trying
o
it
was
sour
but
good
didnt
jump
in
front
of
a
lot
of
other
beers
styles
for
me
but
i
wouldnt
mind
revisiting
after
my
palate
adapts
o
each
sip
changes
the
complexity
of
the
flavors
at
first
i
was
getting
some
fruity
flavors
and
sourness
then
almost
an
earthy
funk
flavor
then
sweetarts
then
unripe
fruit
it
just
bounced
around
making
each
sip
unique
a
really
interesting
beer
the
bottle
says
the
ingredients
are
simply
water
malt
yeast
hops
pretty
amazing
to
see
how
diverse
4
simple
ingredients
can
be
carbonation
feels
excessive
decent
clarity
hard
to
pour
this
without
some
disturbance
of
the
settled
layer
and
great
carbonation
poured
bottle
into
steamed
wine
glass
smell
is
a
lot
of
funk
grassy
some
onion
taste
is
full
of
lemon
and
other
citrus
plenty
of
funk
earthy
oak
nice
subtle
malt
the
carbonation
is
really
nice
overall
i
really
liked
this
im
not
very
experienced
with
gueuze
styles
but
im
glad
the
guy
at
the
shop
recommended
this
bottle
from
tipples
pours
a
deep
hazy
orange
color
with
only
a
small
ring
of
fizzy
white
head
aroma
of
sour
vinegar
some
minty
effervescence
orange
peel
apricots
cherry
green
apple
this
smells
glorious
flavor
is
big
green
apple
sour
vinegar
some
candy
sugar
effervescent
but
not
as
much
carb
as
i
expected
easy
drinking
mouth
puckering
overall
i
like
this
a
lot
even
more
so
than
drie
fontenins
oude
gueze
nice
beer
this
was
a
highly
anticipated
tasting
for
me
a
gueuze
coming
from
worts
brewed
by
boon
lindemans
girardin
and
cantillon
breweries
it
was
enjoyed
at
the
fine
establishment
called
the
blind
tiger
in
nyc
aesthetically
this
beer
is
right
on
the
mark
when
it
comes
to
the
style
with
its
pale
straw
color
slight
haze
and
thin
ring
of
white
over
top
after
a
few
deep
inhalations
of
the
nose
i
picked
up
a
certain
powdery
cue
something
like
powdered
sugar
or
closer
still
actual
baby
powder
other
than
that
assorted
bittersweet
fruit
esters
flavor
wise
its
much
more
sour
than
i
would
have
guessed
almost
puckerinducing
which
is
just
fine
by
me
also
a
tad
earthy
which
blends
well
with
the
overall
flavor
a
bit
grassy
with
rinds
of
citrus
fruits
coming
to
mind
overall
this
has
that
good
balance
of
acidity
and
funkiness
that
the
best
examples
of
this
style
demonstrate
very
much
worth
the
price
these
guys
know
how
to
blend
d
really
nice
with
superb
balance
and
drinkability
complex
enough
to
keep
things
interesting
and
easy
enough
to
be
a
daily
drinker
my
favorite
thus
far
strong
sour
presence
with
lemon
and
funk
not
incredibly
complex
but
still
very
interesting
and
enjoyable
wow
this
stuff
is
damn
good
and
whats
even
better
its
relatively
available
and
moderately
priced
for
the
style
this
stuff
could
certainly
stand
up
to
some
of
the
greats
and
i
believe
this
beer
can
be
overlooked
by
many
yeah
yeah
the
rating
is
high
but
still
this
is
a
very
impressive
brew
sourheads
rejoice
funkheads
rejoice
gueuze
lovers
celebrate
go
get
yourself
some
tilquin
and
thank
me
later
o
considering
its
in
its
youth
its
a
pretty
damn
good
beer
with
a
beautiful
aroma
lovely
for
the
style
nice
balance
and
enjoyable
flavor
as
expected
an
excellent
beer
it
you
like
sours
its
a
must
try
there
may
not
be
many
but
tilquin
à
lancienne
is
definitely
one
of
the
best
gueuze
out
there
anyone
in
possession
of
a
bottle
should
treasure
it
like
a
precious
and
priceless
family
heirloom
anyone
planning
to
age
one
would
be
wise
to
invest
in
a
safety
deposit
box
all
hyperbole
aside
it
is
honestly
one
of
the
finest
beers
ive
ever
had
and
could
have
again
and
again
jd
overall
a
good
gueuze
especially
for
one
that
is
readily
available
o
complex
dry
refreshing
and
delicious
would
love
to
have
more
of
this
one
oa
nicely
crafted
gueze
good
balance
and
flavor
crisp
and
refreshing
overall
solid
beer
thats
a
nice
offering
but
it
didnt
blow
me
away
good
entry
level
gueuze
but
i
recommend
that
you
just
pay
the
extra
money
and
get
something
with
more
complexity
for
a
beer
from
the
gueuze
beer
style
examples
like
drie
fountienen
oude
gueuze
or
golden
blend
overall
like
a
good
champagne
not
particularly
funky
or
sour
but
comes
with
a
nice
refreshing
carbonation
and
good
acidity
its
good
on
a
hot
day
i
prefer
3f
or
cantillons
regular
geuzes
but
this
is
a
lot
more
easily
obtainable
where
i
am
so
i
recommend
trying
this
at
least
once
if
it
hits
your
spot
great
if
not
well
keep
on
looking
for
that
delicious
and
easilyreasonably
obtainable
geuze
if
there
is
a
such
thing
pours
a
pale
orangeshaded
gold
color
quite
cloudy
small
white
head
lots
of
little
bubbles
aroma
has
lots
of
earth
sour
lemons
and
a
pleasant
mineral
tone
lots
of
musty
fruit
apples
berries
grapes
medium
vinegar
and
oak
taste
is
sour
lemons
upfront
then
some
fruity
malt
flavor
and
back
to
more
sourness
that
follows
through
into
a
longlasting
finish
fairly
dry
solid
pucker
nice
tannic
oak
flavor
mouthfeel
is
a
light
sparkle
on
top
of
a
relatively
full
body
for
a
lambic
a
solid
and
balanced
gueuze
perhaps
not
the
most
complex
or
deep
but
very
refreshing
overall
nicely
done
a
tasty
little
sour
that
lacks
depth
but
with
a
few
years
or
perhaps
a
decade
who
knows
what
is
possible
super
funky
even
for
a
style
that
is
sought
out
for
its
funkiness
maybe
a
bad
bottle
honestly
just
this
side
of
undrinkable
mouthfeel
is
dry
and
light
overall
quite
happy
with
my
first
gueuze
in
a
long
time
a
really
well
put
together
gueze
definatly
not
to
harsh
on
the
sourness
which
some
tend
to
be
but
a
nice
first
time
gueze
have
i
had
better
yes
but
this
still
has
its
place
bottle
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
pours
an
enchanting
apricot
hue
with
a
vague
blush
with
a
bubbling
white
head
lovely
aroma
i
mean
just
really
pleasant
marmalade
and
rose
petals
citrus
zest
meyer
lemon
sweetsour
balance
dry
and
acidic
really
nice
beer
o
a
terrific
queuze
and
one
ill
go
back
to
again

gets
better
and
better
the
more
i
drink
must
age
to
see
its
development
pours

hazy
golden

color
a
bit

than
most
other
gueuzes
3f
cantillon
the
head
is
an
off
white
color
that
hangs
out
for
a
little
while
with
an
aggressive
pour
the
aroma
is
bright
and
pronounced
lemon
brettiness
moldy
funk
really
wonderful
flavor
follows
suit
with
a
more
pronounced
funk
and
sour
profile
finishes
dry
with
a
great
sweetness
reminiscent
of
underripe
peaches
and
lemon
juice
dry
complex
and
delicious
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
not
100
sure
what
i
am
looking
for
in
the
style
but
i
do
know
a
balanced
beer
and
this
is
it
well
done
and
one
that
should
be
sought
out
and
dont
forget
to
duck
cheers
overall
this
is
an
excellent
and
probably
a
bit
under
appreciated
gueuze
this
is
extremely
well
balanced
and
can
certainly
hang
with
some
of
the
more
well
known
producers
of
the
style
definitely
worth
picking
up
if
you
see
it
on
a
shelf
edit
changed
a
few
scores
after
my
second
bottle
this
one
a
375ml
with
a
best
before
of
02032021
the
aspirin
quality
that
was
distracting
in
the
first
bottle
wasnt
present
in
this
one
a
little
less
carbonation
too
a
pleasure
to
drink
overall
this
is
a
solid
a
not
a
style
i
would
drink
every
day
but
i
enjoy
it
i
imagine
that
is
representative
of
the
style
i
will
be
seeking
out
others
like
it
perhaps
mariage
parfait
o
this
is
definitely
a
top
10
gueuze
for
me
the
mouth
watering
quality
is
just
out
of
this
world
its
ridiculously
refreshing
and
the
head
stuck
around
for
the
entire
time
i
enjoyed
this
brew
i
will
definitely
buy
again

think
blue

and
quince
paste
but
with
the
extremes
of
salt
and
sugar
replaced
with
sourness
a
lovely
gueuze
mostly
clear
orange
with
a
low
fluffy
head
on
top
that
settles
to
a
creamy
ring
tart
lactic
aromas
of
funky
lemon
granny
smith
apples
grass
sour
citrus
berries
and
a
light
sweetness
sour
woody
flavors
earthy
lemon
leather
damp
hay
and
mustiness
crisp
light
and
super
dry
excellent
the
draught
version
is
a
little
brighter
and
more
outright
refreshing
but
this
has
deeper
complexity
both
are
noticeably
lemony
and
not
over
the
top
with
acidity
and
you
really
cant
go
wrong
with
either
overall
a
crisp
bright
drinkable
wellmade
beer
this
beer
has
a
golden
amber
glow
to
it
and
a
white
bubbly
head
on
top
retention
is
mediocre
deep
and
bright
aroma
dark

flavor
is

fermented

dark

very
bitter
mouthfeel
is
great
overall
an
excellent
choice
as
far
as
gueuzes
you
can
pretty
much
find
at
anytime
go
this
is
the
one
to
get
i
dont
think
it
quite
matches
the
intensitymastery
of
some
other
belgian
brewers
but
certainly
close
this
poured
out
as
a
bright
hazy
orange
color
with
a
foamy
white
head
on
top
pretty
standard
for
the
style
the
retention
is
pretty
solid
but
no
noticeable
lacing
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
acidic
sour
and
tart
smelling
there
is
a
subtle
sweetness
as
well
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
tart
like
a
lemon
or
other
citrus
fruits
with
a
pretty
good
pucker
to
it
the
malts
come
in
lightly
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
lighter
bodied
with
a
solid
carbonation
overall
its
a
good
representation
of
the
style
worth
checking
out
for
sure
o
very
delicious
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
one
and
will
definitely
be
setting
some
aside
for
storage
overall
really
impressed
with
this
and
ill
definitely
be
seeking
out
some
more
perfect
for
this
beautiful
sunday
afternoon
poured
a
clearish
golden
body
with
giant
head
thanks
to
great
carbonation
on
top
of
an
aroma
that
i
can
really
only
describe
as
both
sweet
and
sour
these
tart
cherries
and
splash
of
funk
hit
me
along
with
sour
apple
or
grap
smells
and
then
i
get
this
yeasty
woody
aroma
that
has
a
touch
of
sugariness
in
it
light
to
medium
body
and
goes
down
easy
extreme
sour
and
funky
notes
that
are
like
sour
applepear
and
have
a
veggielike
graininess
to
them
as
well
as
a
good
amount
of
tartness
to
it
as
well
enjoyable
sipper
the
yeast
and
oakiness
help
smooth
it
out
and
it
has
a
touch
of
sweet
fruit
notes
on
the
backend
to
make
a
very
good
beer
the
beer
pours
a
golden
orange
with
copper
highlights
it
also
pours
with
a
healthy
fingers
width
head
of
pebble
like
creamy
white
bubbles
that
are
constantly
fed
by
a
maelstrom
of
bubbles
racing
up
throughout
the
glass
the
head
leaves
a
lacing
of
fat
dry
bubbles
that
clump
into
sheets
on
the
glass
in
body
the
beer
is
properly
hazy
though
the
other
side
of
the
glass
is
slightly
discernable
on
the
nose
the
beer
smells
wonderfully
funky
with
big
cherry
leather
scents
and
pineapple
with
light
spicy
notes
and
distinct
lingering
horse
sweat
there
is
even
some
slight
cheesy
notes
tending
towards
a
blue
or
parmesan
cheese
on
the
tongue
the
beer
tastes
acidic
and
sweet
with
just
a
touch
of
herbal
bitters
and
some
nice
rounding
salty
notes
in
flavors
the
beer
begins
with
spicy
pepper
but
moves
quickly
into
sweet
and
funky
pineapple
and
cherry
leather
flavors
with
sweaty
nuances
and
a
touch
of
cheese
the
pepper
returns
on
the
finish
with
a
faint
touch
of
wheat
and
a
lot
of
sweet
funk
and
acidic
pineapple
the
aftertaste
moves
into
lingering
cherry
leather
flavors
with
a
funky
spice
accenting
it
this
beer
tastes
very
nicely
funky
in
the
mouth
the
beer
feels
medium
in
body
perhaps
a
touch
below
medium
with
a
thick
carbonation
that
peppers
and
then
caresses
the
tastebuds
allowing
for
the
sweetness
of
the
funk
to
do
its
thing
but
also
for
the
beer
to
note
get
cloying
in
nature
the
mouth
is
left
gushing
with
acid
neutralizing
saliva
and
begging
for
more
beer
overall
this
is
a
tremendous
gueuze
that
i
will
regularly
return
to
of
the
gueuzes
i
can
regularly
find
i
believe
this
has
become
my
new
favorite
rich
and
complex
funk
really
shows
itself
in
this
beer
but
the
sweet
and
acidic
components
are
nicely
balanced
perhaps
with
just
a
touch
too
much
acidity
this
is
a
great
beer
and
wonderful
for
summer
sipping
if
you
like
funk
then
you
will
like
this
beer
2011
vintage
this
pours
a
darker
than
average
brassy
color
dull
and
cloudy
with
some
floating
yeast
and
a
huge
white
head
several
inches
high
with
good
retention
the
nose
is
a
little
funky
but
not
nearly
as
blatantly
sour
as
i
am
used
to
in
the
style
it
is
evident
that
there
is
a
lot
more
malt
in
here
than
usual
the
flavor
confirms
that
its
got
a
gentle
caramel
sweetness
to
it
that
really
softens
the
most
acidic
edges
of
the
gueuze
a
characteristic
that
is
not
particularly
becoming
in
this
context
there
is
some
lemon
acidity
but
not
as
fresh
or
as
pungent
as
it
could
be
and
a
lot
of
the
yeast
intricacies
feel
somehow
muted
to
me
i
want
this
style
to
snap
my
head
back
and
dry
my
mouth
out
this
one
doesnt
do
that
at
all
it
is
not
unpleasant
and
may
be
a
good
introductory
beer
to
the
style
but
its
a
far
cry
from
some
of
the
best
in
the
business
fuller
body
still
with
excellent
carbonation
i
really
dont
dislike
this
beer
at
all
i
just
feel
like
its
not
the
best
example
of
the
genre
still
a
good
bottle
that
is
fairly
widely
available
mf
dry
thanks
to
kingkong
for
the
generous

overall
a

gueuze
however
a
bit
young
definitely
would
like
to
see
how
this
beer
develops
with
some
time
beer
is
medium
to
mediumlight
in
body
with
carbonation
of
mediumlow
intensity
resulting
in
a
pleasantly
soft
gentle
foaming
that
mixes
well
with
the
notable
acidity
of
the
beer
closes
quite
dry
with
minor
stickiness
lingering
across
the
palate
overall
a
world
class
guezue
one
of
the
best
in
the
world
in
my
opinion
this
surpasses
the
draft
version
for
upholding
the
yeasty
texture
that
makes
this
beer
really
one
of
a
kind
in
the
world
of
oude
gueuzes
i
could
seriously
drink
this
every
day
if
i
had
the
budget
and
patience
to
do
so
as
its
refreshing
complex
yet
ridiculously
balanced
overall
given
the
variety
of
flavors
it
provides
pleasant
to
drink
world
class
for
sure
o
my
first
gueuze
that
i
recall
if
this
is
how
most
of
them
are
i
can
see
me
hunting
down
more
of
this
style
what
a
remarkable
beer
o
finally
a
gueuze
i
can
really
get
down
with
after
having
the
overly
intense
drie
fonteinen
oude
gueuze
i
was
hesitant
to
drop
another
1215
on
a
little
12
7
oz
bottle
of
something
i
thought
i
might
dislike
but
im
glad
i
took
the
risk
as
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
not
too
sour
not
too
harsh
a
great
example
of
the
style
imo
d
great
gueuze
great
finish
and
overall
complexity
and
balance

very
good

very
drinkable

yum
thanks
frank
o
overall
an
excellent
gueuze
really
enjoyed
this
one
pricy
bottle
but
thats
to
be
expected
for
the
style
highly
recommend
mouthfeeloverall
mouthfeel
is
light
with
about
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
overall
a
really
good
gueuze
very
solid
example
of
the
style
o
an
incredible
gueuze
right
up
there
with
drie
fonteinen
and
cantillon
overall
a
really
nice
gueuze
definitely
underrated
glad
to
have
this
available
stateside
no
extra
points
for
barrelaging
elements
or
additions
but
a
very
solid
overall
gueuze
wellenjoyed
overall
this
is
most
definitely
one
of
my
favourite
and
certainly
most
drinkable
gueuzes
its
a
style
i
love
already
and
when
someone
does
it
as
well
as
this
i
feel
right
in
being
effusive
this
is
just
an
absolutely
fucking
brilliant
beer
o
a
nearperfect
example
of
the
gueuze
style
sour
wellbalanced
malty
and
fruity
this
is
a
great
beer
to
start
with
if
youre
unfamiliar
with
the
style
o
great
gueuze
and
sour
not
the
best
but
still
well
worth
picking
up
if
you
can
o
this
is
a
well
made
easy
to
drink
beer
definitely
one
of
the
better
gueuzes
youll
find
drinkable
overall
a
well
balanced
and
drinkable
beer
would
definitely
try
again
overall
a
very
good
gueuze
in
my
opinion
ill
take
this
one
over
the
majority
of
the
gueuzes
ive
had
with
the
exception
of
my
favorite
cantillon
and
a
few
of
the
rarer
more
expensive
ones
o
this
is
a
really
nice
gueuze
i
will
buy
more
for
cellaring
and
to
get
a
better
idea
of
it
o
really
enjoyed
this
highly
recommend
it
to
fans
of
the
style
i
guess
im
still
sort
of
a
beginner
when
it
comes
to
geuze
but
i
thought
this
was
really
accessible
while
still
being
sophisticated
to
my
palate
shared
this
with
a
friend
who
is
newer
to
geuze
than
i
am
and
he
said
that
the
aroma
was
maybe
too
much
for
him
but
it
tasted
great
instant
hartburn
i
dont
think
i
can
finish
this
beer
considering
the
only
beer
i
dumped
in
the
last
couple
years
had
shards
of
broken
glass
in
it
thats
saying
alot
by
far
one
of
the
worst
great
beers
i
have
had
in
a
while
starting
to
wonder
if
every
beer
is
c
or
better
on
beer
advocate
overall
a
fantastic
representative
of
the
blended
lambic
genre
o
all
kinds
of
funk
citrus
flavors
smooth
this
one
out
t
opens
with
a
nice
vinegar
snap
of
tartness
green
apple
and
sour
white
grapes
followed
by
a
slight
hint
of
grain
and
a
very
tart
lingering
slightly
dry
finish
that
leaves
you
wanting
a
lot
more
lemon
comes
in
on
the
finish
as
well
mouthfeel
is
light
and
the
carbonation
is
pretty
lively
without
being
overwhelming
a
pretty
fantastic
gueuze
o
pretty
much
what
you
would
expect
from
a
gueuze
the
blending
of
the
different
worts
definitely
works
and
provides
some
nice
complexity
and
balance
fairly
averagely
priced
too
worth
a
try
the
beer
pours
a
cloudy
orangeyellow
with
an
effervescent
white
head
that
settles
down
into
a
thin
blanketing
the
nose
is
sweet
and
sour
with
a
touch
of
tangy
citrus
its
taste
presents
an
initial
sweetness
which
soon
transitions
into
a
potent
saliva
inducing
sourness
and
finishes
with
a
slightly
herbal
champagnelike
dryness
the
herbal
characteristic
is
so
subtle
im
wondering
if
its
just
my
imagination
the
beer
is
light
bodied
and
drinkable
with
ample
carbonation
and
sweetness
to
counter
its
immense
sourness
honestly
this
beer
gives
cantillon
and
3f
a
serious
run
for
their
money
and
for
the
price
it
is
definitely
worth
trying
o
the
beer
initially
makes
your
mouth
water
then
dries
it
out
this
is
a
well
balanced
gueuze
that
is
refreshing
and
tart
clear
orangeish
with
a
light
white
head
film
of
retention
and
some
lacing
nose
of
dill
lemons
green
apples
grains
barnyard
sweaty
socks
and
butthole
srs
but
a
clean
one
some
earthy
tones
as
well
and
light
barrel
taste
has
more
lemons
apples
barny
funk
acetic
but
sweeter
malt
character
not
as
sour
as
i
expected
and
its
awesome
for
this
medium
high
carbonation
and
excellent
balance
awesome
overall
this
is
incredible
damn
near
perfect
gueze
o
very
drinkable
gueuze
solid
true
to
form
and
accessible

this
is
an
excellent
beer
and
its
wonderful
to
have
another
traditional

available
in
local
stores
i
hope
to
see
more
lambics
available
from
tilquin
in
the

taste
is

it
needs
more
rustic

though
to
be
truly
great
in
my
book
it
has
a
nice
engaging
and
lively
feel
o
its
a
nice
sour
ale
i
wouldnt
call
it
beginner
friendly
at
all
though
due
to
the
tartness
i
would
point
fans
of
flanders
sours
to
this
one
however
shame
it
had
compete
against
the
two
titans
of
the
style
even
though
it
came
in
third
in
the
gueuze
showdown
i
reckon
it
would
be
superior
to
any
other
gueuze
on
the
market
not
from
cantiloon
or
3f
that
is
overall
this
was
a
good
and
challenging
gueuze
thought
the
vinegar
and
acidity
was
perhaps
a
touch
too
much
to
really
make
it
an
enjoyable
drink
a
full
bottle
might
be
rough
that
said
this
was
one
of
my
favorites
of
the
evening
and
is
definitely
more
my
style
it
also
mixed
really
well
with
the
cantillon
once
i
started
belnding
myself
well
worth
checking
out
recommended
not
cheap
but
not
ridiculous
i
might
grab
a
few
more
for
trading
and
aging
depending
on
what
hits
the
market
here
in
alberta
as
ive
already
spent
my
beer
budget
for
the
year
next
year
that
is
o
great
gueuze
very
tart
but
still
nicely
balanced
and
complex
this
beer
was
a
close
2nd
place
in
the
blind
tasting
of
the
5
gueuzes
this
style
is
still
somewhat
new
to
me
and
my
judgement
means
very
little
i
am
glad
to
see
other
bas
enjoy
this
brew
as
much
as
i
did
it
tells
me
my
appraisal
is
probably
accurate
and
my
approach
to
this
style
seems
to
be
developing
my
palate
in
the
proper
way
im
glad
this
beer
was
suggested
to
me
its
easy
to
find
where
i
live
so
i
anticipate
buying
a
bit
more
of
it
the
quality
of
this
beer
cannot
be
denied
pours
a
slightly
hazy
medium
golden
color
with
a
huge
bubbly
white
head
that
held
on
for
over
a
half
hour
while
i
made
dinner
wonderful
tart
and
fruity
and
funky
aroma
smells
of
lemons
sour
oranges
and
sour
apples
pepper
and
yeast
esters
a
bit
of
funk
and
a
hint
of
acetic
the
flavor
is
a
nice
mix
of
funk
and
tart
with
peppery
and
yeasty
funk
up
front
followed
by
some
light
tart
fruits
plastic
phenols
and
finishing
with
a
long
lingering
lactic
and
lemon
finish
medium
body
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
and
a
tart
funky
lightly
puckering
mouthfeel
i
can
see
what
all
the
fuss
is
about
here
this
is
a
damn
fine
example
of
the
style
if
not
a
hint
on
the
bold
side
of
things
i
really
enjoyed
this
if
only
they
sold
it
local
to
me
a
very
solid
version
of
the
style
not
the
best
ive
had
but
nothing
to
really
complain
about
either
o
i
had
heard
good
things
about
this
one
and
am
glad
they
were
true
an
absolutely
classic
example
that
is
both
dynamic
and
a
perfect
balance
of
everything
i
like
in
a
gueuze
world
class
overall
this
would
be
a
4
65
one
of
the
better
gueuzes
out
there
gives
the
other
belgiums
a
run
for
their
money
i
would
drink
this
one
again
very
good
o
4
o
a
nice
sour
vinegary
beer
that
is
nice
to
drink
definitely
will
pick
up
some
more
of
these
if
the
next
time
i
see
it
as
it
lets
you
get
a
nice
gueuze
fix
that
you
can
actually
find
a
really
solid
gueuze
i
was
able
to
try
out
the
sour
notes
are
upfront
and
long
lasting
making
this
a
great
sipping
beer
the
mouthfeel
has
a
wonderful
texture
and
the
taste
is
perfection
i
great
example
of
a
powerfully
flavor
sour
beer
not
sure
how
hard
it
is
to
find
i
know
its
not
available
in
my
state
though
the
beers
overall
fruitearth
brinemalt
mineralbitter
interplay
the
beer
begs
for
a
rustic
pairing
with
mussels
or
fishermans
chowder
its
a
wonderful
beer
that
easily
compares
favorably
with
many
more
famed
sour
ale
makers
of
belgium
drinkability
pretty
high
this
is
an
excellant
blend
nice
depth
but
not
overwhelming
bought
at
the
butcher
shop
downtown
uncaged
the
bottle
set
it
on
the
counter
and
then
cork
just
shot
out
of
it
didnt
know
i
wanted
a
geuze
mark
on
the
ceiling
but
i
like
it
poured
into
my
coolship
allagash
glass
to
a
nice
hazy
yellow
with
a
decent
and
lingering
head
wonderful
aroma
definite
farmhouse
funk
that
is
very
reminiscent
of
the
cantillon
geuze
pretty
decent
mouthfeel
with
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
taste
is
tart
and
refreshing
that
vanishes
well
leaving
you
wanting
more
o
a
ranks
among
the
best
offtheshelf
sours
available
in
america
a
tasty
gueuze
not
amazing
but
nicely
sour
and
distinctly
dry
flavor
has
decent
depth
but
its
a
little
on
the
drythin
side
o
more
on
the
crisprefreshing
side
than
the
earthyfunky
side
at
this
point
though
there
is
a
nice
funkiness
looking
forward
to
seeing
how
this
develops
hopefully
the
flavor
will
be
equal
to
the
aroma
someday
still
a
very
enjoyable
gueuze
overall
fantastic
a
really
excellent
gueuze
wish
i
had
bought
more
bottle
poured
into
snifter
appearance
is
hazy
orange
with
dense
creamy
white
head
great
retention
some
lacing
the
nose
has
a
lot
going
on
notes
of
sourdough
lactic
acid
and
oak
come
through
the
biggest
some
delicate
waves
of
lemon
and
funk
come
through
as
well
the
taste
incredibly
tart
and
fruity
note
of
white
wine
oak
and
loads
of
lactic
acid
are
present
there
is
some
underlying
funk
that
is
at
the
perfect
level
for
my
taste
the
front
is
puckering
tart
which
develops
into
a
balance
with
some
moderate
sweetness
this
one
is
delicious
mouthfeel
is
light
with
high
carbonation
overall
this
is
one
of
my
new
favorite
gueuzes
great
range
of
flavors
and
delicious
balance
very
tart
and
definitely
worth
seeking
out
o
not
as
complex
as
i
expected
but
balanced
and
enjoyable
very
approachable
for
the
style
an
awesome
unfussy
gueuze
recommended
for
the
price
o
a
really
awesome
gueuze
the
aroma
on
its
own
sets
this
beer
apart
has
nice
complexity
and
is
highly
drinkable
an
approachable
enough
if
thats
a
real
thing
gueuze
the
sour
and
tart
notes
are
there
for
sure
and
the
funk
is
restrained
to
a
bit
part
so
no
one
should
be
all
that
overwhelmed
a
single
extreme
flavour
at
a
time
and
all
that
as
for
me
i
found
this
to
be
nicely
in
my
face
at
first
and
then
forgiving
as
i
acclimatized
and
then
rode
out
happily
to
the
end
pretty
enjoyable
probably
not
as
good
as
most
cantillon
stuff
but
lots
of
complex
flavors
and
subtles
o
bright
acidic
not
the
most
complex
but
really
tasty
and
welldone
ive
heard
this
is
one
of
the
less
sour
gueuzes
around
and
i
in
fact
did
not
find
it
real
sour
i
think
for
that
reason
i
was
able
to
truly
enjoy
this
o
what
an
excellent
blend
gueuzes
i
am
super
impressed
with
this
beer
and
very
happy
to
have
more
of
this
in
my
cellar
o
a
very
nice
gueuze
wish
i
had
bought
more
than
one
bottle
of
it
could
drink
this
one
all
day
wow
excellent
brew
poured
cold
with
a
large
offwhite
foamy
frothy
thick
head
that
lasts
a
while
and
lots
of
lace
color
is
a
slightly
hazy
amber
with
a
load
of
tiny
bubble
trails
aroma
is
yeast
sour
bread
dough
malt
a
fresh
and
clean
quality
flavors
like
nose
fresh
and
clean
very
dry
with
bitter
and
carbonic
working
very
well
with
each
other
back
of
the
tongue
is
left
with
an
astringent
feel
body
and
carbonation
are
perfect
finish
is
like
flavor
with
a
slight
dry
champagne
flavor
and
again
very
clean
outstanding
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
which
im
really
enjoying
however
i
wish
the
flavor
had
the
same
wonderful
complexity
as
the
aroma
375
ml
bottle
label
is
20102011
pours
a
clear
golden
amber
with
a
small
white
head
that
has
decent
retention
and
leaves
some
light
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
is
funky
brett
some
light
lemon
and
a
light
earthiness
not
terribly
complex
but
not
bad
the
taste
has
a
light
initial
sweetness
with
some
barnyard
funk
light
lemon
and
a
decent
tartness
the
finish
has
a
funky
earthiness
medium
body
light
carbonation
not
bad
but
not
nearly
as
complex
as
the
best
gueuzes
ill
be
curious
if
the
3year
blend
is
a
big
improvement
over
this
2year
blend
nice
tones
throughout
on
this
beer
though
it
doesnt
really
blow
me
away
in
any
particular
way
its
just
good
nice
character
nice
feel
nice
all
the
way
around
i
guess
thats
the
bottom
line
on
this
one
its
nice
definitely
holds
all
the
character
you
really
hope
for
a
gueuze
if
you
enjoy
the
style
highly
suggested
i
think
i
may
get
several
of
these
and
let
them
rest
for
a
while
had
this
at
city
beer
store
in
san
francisco
pours
a
light
hazy
yellow
tastes
nicely
sour
with
some
tartness
fruits
like
green
apples
and
some
lemon
come
through
on
the
taste
the
sourness
wasnt
overpowering
drank
down
really
smooth
this
style
is
really
opening
my
eyes
to
these
type
of
beers
very
tasty
lightbodied
with
lively
carbonation
very
dry
clean
drinking
and
refreshing
paired
extremely
well
with
some
locallymade
goat
cheese
and
crackers
while
spending
the
weekend
in
wine
country
on
long
island
a
bit
on
the
expensive
side
or
id
buy
a
whole
lot
more
of
this
given
what
went
into
this
blend
theres
no
surprise
that
the
end
product
is
world
class
definitely
a
winner
and
a
must
try
in
the
easiertoprocure
gueuze
category
o
well
thats
very
interesting
its
certainly
not
what
id
reach
for
when
i
want
a
beer
but
its
a
really
nice
other
category
of
beverage
and
pretty
refined
flavorful
pressing
a
few
buttons
yet
tastefully
restrained
and
classy
i
could
see
serving
this
at
a
nice
dinner
party
whether
just
for
the
people
who
arent
into
beer
or
for
everyone
more
people
should
know
about
this
category
i
love
that
the
expiration
date
for
a
2011
beer
is
2021
thanks
once
again
to
the
fantastic
trader
yeahnatenelson
this
is
not
the
best
gueuze
ive
ever
had
but
it
might
be
one
of
the
most
sour
the
sour
tart
and
the
funk
is
remarkable
cheers
to
all
of
the
strains
of
bacteria
that
make
this
so
weird
overall
nice
depth
of
flavor
and
a
good
blend
of
wood
and
tartness
easy
drinking
for
the
style
but
still
carries
enough
tartness
to
be
worth
it
compared
to
the
draft
bottle
is
a
bit
brighter
very
light
funk
level
to
this
still
this
is
rather
fresh
citrusy
and
hoppy
notes
are
present
faint
sourness
in
the
finish
light
cob
web
funk
the
nose
is
about
the
same
as
draft
and
not
as
bright
as
the
flavor
in
this
one
going
to
be
develope
well
imo
great
classic
gueze
o
excellent
balanced
gueuze
if
i
had
to
nitpick
i
would
say
that
it
has
a
little
bit
too
mich
yeasty
character
otherwise
its
one
of
the
best
gueuzes
available
4
5
i
havent
had
too
many
examples
of
this
style
but
its
certainly
one
that
i
will
continue
to
seek
out
this
was
a
solid
beer
that
i
would
be
happy
to
drink
regularly
with
a
nice
level
of
funk
and
sourness
ill
have
to
check
back
on
this
one
after
a
little
more
experience
with
gueuze
thanks
again
carleton
cheers
the
body
is
light
and
crisp
with
a
lingering
finish
and
some
good
carbonation
overall
this
one
surprised
me
ill
want
more
of
this
but
i
liked
it
a
lot
more
than
i
had
expected
not
that
i
didnt
expect
to
like
it
the
sour
dominates
this
beer
from
beginning
to
end
and
a
very
good
geuze
in
my
book
a
great
beer
for
lovers
of
sour
overall
politely
discreet
refreshing
and
just
a
good
gueze
overall
o
a
great
example
of
the
style
and
a
very
enjoyable
beer
not
too
funky
and
not
too
sour
but
the
combination
of
flavors
and
smell
are
something
i
can
really
appreciate
not
the
easiest
drinking
beer
but
one
i
very
much
enjoyed
and
would
definitely
have
again
o
this
is
a
fine
example
of
the
styleit
has
a
nice
amount
of
funkiness
and
sournessbut
neither
of
these
is
over
the
top
making
this
very
drinkable
there
is
a
substantial
mouth
coating
tannic
character
on
the
palate
which
may
contribute
to
a
fuller
feeling
mouthfeel
carbonation
level
is
appropriately
high
overall
an
enjoyable
gueuze
that
is
probably
a
notch
below
the
elite
versions

i
liked
this
bottle
and
will
be
ordering
another
bottle
next
month
perhaps
i
will
get
2
and
age
one
great
gueuze
aroma
is
exquisite
likely
the
standout
quality
for
this
beer
however
its
a
little
lacking
in
the
barnyard
qualities
they
are
too
soft
but
the
other
aroma
complexities
make
up
for
that
shortcoming
also
the
aftertaste
is
quite
acetic
actually
taking
away
from
the
balance
if
the
rating
system
had
25s
id
likely
use
them
across
the
board
as
i
had
a
difficult
time
rating
this
one
bottle
poured
a
clear
bright
golden
color
lambic
with
a
super
huge
foamy
head
with
great
retention
and
some
good
lacing
aroma
consists
of
light
sour
notes
with
light
funky
ester
taste
is
also
a
mix
between
some
sour
and
tart
notes
with
light
acidic
undertones
and
some
light
funky
ester
body
is
about
average
with
good
carbonation
well
put
together
lambic
mix
except
it
may
be
a
bit
too
balanced
toward
sour
and
acidic
notes
for
my
liking
i
would
have
preferred
more
green
apple
and
barnyard
notes
personally
verdict
exceptional
gueuze
from
the
gueuzerie
tilquin
the
flavors
are
exceptionally
complex
the
body
is
spot
on
and
it
has
just
enough
to
sourness
to
satisfy
any
sour
lover
while
being
accessible
to
anyone
looking
to
try
a
great
gueuze
pours
a
cloudy
straw
yellowlight
orange
color
with
a
bright
white
onefinger
head
goes
quickly
aroma
of
lemon
zest
orange
peel
sour
apple
a
bit
of
barnyard
funk
and
nice
tart
cherry
and
berry
notes
flavor
begins
with
a
nice
amount
of
tart
citrus
lemon
peel
green
apples
tart
berries
and
lesser
sour
cherry
notes
grass
and
slight
earthiness
in
the
middle
before
a
middling
funky
musty
ending
bubbly
light
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
good
flavor
not
too
tart
not
too
funky
great
combination
of
the
flavors
that
changes
from
sip
to
sip
o
this
is
a
very
tasty
gueuze
again
rather
accessable
for
me
love
the
green
apple
tartness
very
crisp
and
clean
o
a
very
nice
gueze
however
the
oak
notes
can
be
a
bit
strange
at
times
hoping
this
one
will
improve
a
little
with
some
age
although
it
is
very
pleasant
to
begin
with
the
only
thing
that
stopped
me
from
marking
this
higher
was
the
strange
oak
bite
overall
a
really
worthwhile
and
enjoyable
gueuze
the
fruit
notes
definitely
what
sets
this
apart
from
others
drinking
very
nicely
right
now
and
definitely
should
age
with
the
best
of
them
definitely
one
i
would
pick
up
often
at
the
price
very
well
done
im
very
excited
to
see
what
new
projects
come
our
way
from
tilquin
overall
a
great
gueuze
if
not
quite
living
up
to
its
most
impressive
competitors
im
glad
i
have
a
couple
of
bottles
stashed
away
so
i
can
partake
of
this
whenever
i
want
this
is
a
damn
good
gueuze
already
i
cant
wait
to
have
one
that
is
a
proper
blend
of
3
2
and
1
year
old
lambics
this
definitely
has
me
excited
as
this
particular
blend
shows
a
lot
of
potential
it
could
use
a
more
muted
oak
profile
and
the
acidity
might
be
a
bit
more
rounded
but
i
really
like
the
fruitiness
and
the
funkiness
and
even
the
oak
and
acidity
i
cant
wait
to
get
more
vintages
of
this
o
i
love
this
beer
i
wish
i
could
make
myself
pay
around
11
bucks
every
couple
of
days
for
12
oz
of
this
beer
i
cant
but
i
would
love
to
buy
again
soonish
o
this
is
a
very
good
gueuze
i
may
have
to
get
some
more
o
i
have
had
this
one
three
times
now
and
it
is
really
growing
on
me
it
has
quite
a
bit
of
flavor
yet
it
remains
easy
to
drink
i
will
have
to
stock
up
on
this
one
when
i
see
it
d
this
was
an
excellent
gueuze
maybe
i
just
havent
had
one
in
a
while
so
i
forgot
how
great
they
are
but
this
is
hugely
complex
and
delicate
and
bold
great
scent
and
taste
with
refreshing
and
fitting
body
definitely
needs
to
be
sipped
but
the
finish
is
nice
and
clean
age
forever
or
drink
whenever
recommended
a
terrific
gueuze
i
hope
i
can
find
this
in
a
shop
near
me
soon
this
beer
pours
a
light
bodied
and
highly
carbonated
honey
gold
in
color
with
slight
turbidity
and
constant
bubbling
the
nose
is
on
the
funkier
side
even
for
a
geueze
it
has
plenty
of
wild
yeast
brett
going
on
as
well
as
an
ever
so
slight
sweetness
on
the
backed
the
flavors
are
right
up
my
alley
there
are
boatloads
of
very
dry
brett
lemon
barnyard
sour
apple
dehydrated
fruit
and
it
has
moderate
acidity
im
a
pretty
big
fan
it
drinks
light
with
plenty
of
carbonation
and
finishes
dry
with
a
slight
pucker
this
is
a
really
nice
geueze
id
place
it
behind
only
cantillons
classic
geueze
and
hanssens
oude
geueze
the
one
thing
i
did
very
like
was
it
was
very
crisp
much
more
than
any
other
beer
i
have
tasted
as
i
mentioned
above
about
sparkling
wine
it
presented
itself
almost
champagne
like
o
i
really
solid
beer
all
around
pretty
sure
this
was
from
a
fresh
batch
but
i
cant
wait
to
age
it
a
bit
i
think
it
will
surely
hold
up
quite
well
over
time
very
nice
for
sure
drink
another
one
of
those
beers
i
always
wanted
to
try
and
poof
there
it
was
at
this
tasting
bobby
thanks
for
sharing
appreciate
it
very
much
i
would
really
like
to
sit
and
savor
on
a
bottle
of
this
one
pours
a
murky
light
yellow
with
a
white
head
that
fades
to
a
film
on
the
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
on
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
sour
citrus
funk
and
some
earthy
aromas
taste
is
very
much
the
same
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
and
acidic
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
very
good
gueuze
and
im
glad
i
got
a
chance
to
try
this
one
the
beer
pours
a
dark
straw
orange
color
with
minimal
foam
looks
like
a
gueuze
the
aroma
is
a
nice
mixture
of
tart
unripe
green
apples
lemon
and
vinegar
a
little
funk
manages
to
penetrate
as
well
the
flavor
is
very
tart
with
apples
acidic
and
sour
like
a
lemon
and
dry
as
bone
the
earthy
funk
a
combination
of
must
and
oak
raises
its
head
toward
the
end
but
it
really
plays
second
fiddle
to
the
tartness
and
citrus
a
nice
blended
gueuze
o
really
impressive
nice
and
sour
funky
nice
fruity
notes
would
definitely
drink
again
overall
this
is
a
decent
gueuze
but
not
the
best
i
have
had
there
isnt
enough
funk
and
it
doesnt
finish
quite
dry
enough
it
isnt
bad
though
and
i
probably
would
get
it
again
overall
this
was
a
really
nice
beer
very
enjoyable
and
drinkable
fits
the
style
well
o
a
very
well
balanced
gueuze
moderate
amounts
of
sourness
oak
funk
everything
works
together
to
create
a
great
flavor
not
as
complex
as
some
others
but
its
certainly
up
there
in
my
favorites
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
the
only
thing
i
would
pick
out
to
be
improved
is
the
finish
i
could
use
more
dryness
light
and
refreshing
i
would
definitely
have
another
o
ive
had
both
in
bottle
and
on
draft
bottle
is
better
in
my
opinion
draft
wasnt
funky
enough
overall
a
good
beer
better
when
i
was
in
brussels
at
a
bar
but
what
beer
isnt
i
am
hesitant
to
purchase
again
given
the
price
tag
maybe
grab
a
bottle
and
do
a
good
sized
gueuze
tasting
here
in
a
few
maybe
a
couple
for
the
cellar
see
how
they
mature
overall
a
great
gueuze
and
one
i
will
certainly
have
again
i
wonder
how
the
lou
pepe
gueuze
that
i
am
drinking
tomorrow
will
compare
this
is
very
tasty
i
will
look
for
more
one
of
the
best
gueuzes
out
there
i
have
had
the
luck
of
tasting
many
greats
and
this
is
their
equal
highest
recommendation
o
this
really
is
one
of
my
favorite
gueuzes
cantillon
tends
to
be
bracingly
sour
and
drie
fonteinen
is
super
funky
this
beer
fits
neatly
in
the
middle
great
balance
and
high
level
of
drinkability
excellent
vintage
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
balances
towards
the
acidic
end
but
not
overly
in
the
vinegar
world
really
nice
brew
medium
body
with
nice
carbonation
beautifully
blended
with
great
flavors
definitely
a
fave
for
me
smell
is
very
enticing
sour
wild
yeast
acidic
to
the
nose
exciting
aromatics
i
like
it
thin
layer
of
frothy
head
with
surprising
head
retention
looks
like
a
wheat
beer
with
a
good
haze
and
yelloworange
hue
flavor
wise
you
cant
ask
for
much
more
in
a
traditional
gueuze
i
cant
believe
ive
never
seen
or
heard
of
this
beer
before
as
it
is
truly
outstanding
bright
lemon
citrus
brettanomyces
character
tart
and
puckering
lingering
subtle
yeast
flavors
in
the
after
taste
mellow
oakiness
pleasant
raw
wheat
body
decent
abv
for
a
lambic
will
certainly
keep
an
eye
out
for
this
one
in
the
future
this
beer
pours
a
nice
straw
yellow
color
with
a
thin
white
head
that
recedes
rather
quickly
the
smell
is
tart
lemony
with
hints
of
apple
and
a
nice
funk
the
flavor
starts
off
with
a
light
funk
followed
by
a
crisp
tartness
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
well
carbed
overall
a
superbly
balanced
gueuze
taste
is
very
nice
starts
off
with
a
large
wave
of
sour
which
rounds
out
to
show
a
good
amount
of
sweet
and
sour
lemon
finishes
tart
and
dry
with
some
great
notes
of
brett
in
the
background
very
well
made
gueuze
too
expensive
though
overall
im
enjoying
the
experience
its
a
taste
i
can
expect
when
i
open
a
bottle
d
i
preferred
the
draft
version
but
this
is
good
also
a
bit
more
sour
with
a
nice
horsey
funk
throughout
the
beer
great
blend
for
a
first
commercial
release
and
i
expect
to
see
funkier
ones
as
they
begin
to
use
older
lambics
you
can
definitely
taste
the
cantillon
lambic
in
this
although
this
beer
pours
an
impressive
dense
head
and
has
a
nice
opaque
golden
hue
the
lack
of
lacing
deminishes
it
slightly
very
good
head
retention
though
especially
for
a
gueuze
leather
wet
straw
and
lemon
peels
not
much
more
to
say
about
the
aroma
its
nice
enough
actually
rather
nice
just
not
to
complex
wheaty
slightly
funky
some
good
old
oak
presence
big
lemon
citrus
and
grass
character
nice
tartsour
finish
pretty
well
balanced
kinda
of
a
puffy
mouthfeel
thanks
to
the
good
carbonation
with
a
drying
finish
nice
id
revisit
this
d
great
stuff
one
of
the
better
gueuzes
out
of
belgium
highly
recommended
to
other
gueuzelovers
into
a
tulip
it
was
a
light
orange
brown
with
a
very
nice
three
finger
head
of
lace
and
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
streaming
up
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
nice
retention
only
gradually
let
the
head
fade
away
what
was
left
was
a
very
nice
set
of
concentric
side
glass
rings
of
lace
smell
was
very
sour
lots
of
grapes
and
other
fruits
a
bit
light
on
the
nose
before
the
sour
wrath
kicks
in
flavor
was
very
full
and
robust
nice
yeast
filled
flavor
wrecks
your
taste
buds
but
calms
down
considerably
on
the
finish
a
huge
rush
of
sour
fruit
than
kicks
into
overdrive
and
puckers
your
lips
through
the
finish
bright
lemon
flavors
orange
undertones
moderatly
sour
super
flavorful
and
complex
each
sip
is
to
be
savored
nice
effort
here
on
a
style
that
not
easy
to
get
right
overall
fantastic
and
solid
medium
bodied
with
a
tart
puckering
mouthfeel
and
a
decent
amount
of
sour
funk
and
acidity
lingering
lactic
funk
with
some
sharp
citrus
acidity
but
it
never
becomes
too
harsh
hints
of
oak
lemoncitrus
peel
and
lingering
acetic
vinegar
a
bit
young
at
this
stage
but
still
delicate
and
flavorful
there
is
something
about
this
beer
i
really
enjoy
very
good
and
aggressive
gueuze
a
true
gem
o
loved
this
one
it
has
a
nice
balance
to
it
that
is
not
overly
tart
but
yet
still
has
enough
to
keep
you
wanting
more
id
love
to
aquire
a
bottle
of
this
and
let
it
ride
for
1015
years
just
to
see
how
it
develops
definitely
recommended
nice
amberyorangish
with
a
white
head
that
fades
to
a
collar
and
leaves
a
little
lace
nose
is
lemons
grape
nerds
fruit
loops
sweet
tarts
citrus
rind
must
funk
and
cobweb
taste
is
a
fine
balance
of
cheesy
goaty
funk
with
grapefruit
rind
and
lemon
the
sweet
cereal
and
candy
that
i
get
in
the
nose
is
blended
with
the
sour
extremely
well
to
create
a
really
nice
flavor
medium
body
silky
to
me
and
just
sharp
enough
good
finish
with
no
improper
aftertastes
just
delicious
and
for
a
first
effort
what
pierre
tilquin
shows
us
is
straight
yum
extra
points
for
being
so
new
to
the
game
and
creating
a
gueuze
that
will
stand
up
to
the
best
cant
wait
to
see
what
the
future
holds
overall
a
very
good
gueuze
great
flavors
and
complexity
poured
a
corked
and
caged
375ml
into
my
boulevard
goblet
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
golden
straw
with
a
rather
surprisingly
large
head
of
a
gueuze
a
little
bit
of
lacing
was
left
down
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
bright
citrus
up
front
reminds
me
of
lemon
and
grapefruit
rind
and
pith
grass
with
a
bit
of
old
lady
closet
fairly
heavy
on
the
must
the
flavor
is
much
the
same
with
heavy
citrus
up
front
lots
of
lemon
rind
and
cut
grass
just
a
hint
of
vinegar
lots
of
must
and
damp
earth
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
finishes
dry
but
not
as
dry
as
some
gueuzes
ive
had
overall
im
pretty
excited
to
have
another
blender
in
business
especially
if
it
means
ill
have
a
traditional
gueuze
selection
on
my
local
shelves
the
palate
opens
sharp
and
sour
with
a
blend
of
grapefruit
lemon
and
lactic
sourness
theres
a
sharpness
present
that
makes
me
think
green
apples
as
well
the
midpalate
has
a
pretty
solid
grainy
and
wheat
husk
tannin
character
drying
out
the
palate
and
focusing
the
sourness
the
funk
is
moderate
slightly
whelmed
by
the
sourness
earthy
on
the
finish
with
some
dried
mushrooms
theres
a
long
lasting
grapefruit
pith
sourness
blended
with
some
lactic
sourness
light
in
body
but
with
a
noticeable
grainy
heft
that
lends
no
sweetness
and
keeps
this
from
being
watery
this
beer
does
feel
a
little
full
even
highly
carbonated
a
little
too
much
for
my
liking
and
has
a
very
tasty
finish
and
an
hour
in
when
the
carbonation
dies
down
the
tannins
do
begin
to
take
over
along
with
the
boon
lambic
this
is
an
excellent
gueuze
and
one
i
will
drink
more
of
and
when
put
in
the
context
of
it
being
pierres
first
commercial
release
that
he

and
while
it
could
use
more
complexity
so
good
big
raspberry
throughout
some
funk
hay
barnyardy
flavors
finishes
dry
and
slightly
sour
nothing
too
overwhelming
love
this
the
flavor
is
pretty
intense
with
a
dry
tart
tangy
and
puckering
sour
yet
refined
flavor
with
wood
and
lemony
lactic
element
yet
malt
is
slightly
balancing
as
it
evolves
with
a
mild
sweetfruity
combination
of
wild
yeast
in
the
flavor
the
taste
has
a
subtle
earthy
funk
in
the
background
adding
to
the
complexity
of
flavor
with
a
mineral
dryess
perhaps
from
the
high
carbonation
as
it
finishes
tart
the
flavor
is
great
and
so
is
the
drinkability
i
never
had
the
bottle
but
now
that
i
have
had
the
draft
version
i
would
like
to
try
it
this
is
a
wondeful
gueuze
with
subtle
and
drinkable
qualities
in
every
way
lots
of
tangy
sour
vinegar
qualities
in
this
with
some
honey
and
apple
cider
on
the
nose
the
flavor
is
more
white
wine
champagne
apple
cider
vinegar
straw
or
barnyard
grain
apple
and
pear
the
feel
is
very
light
with
what
seems
to
be
no
carbonation
much
like
a
cider
looks
the
part
straw
colored
brew
with
a
lot
more
carbonation
than
i
expected
massive
cloudy
head
and
a
tad
of
oily
lacing
lingering
on
the
now
empty
glass
the
nose
is
very
floral
charred
wood
and
lemon
are
imminently
present
the
taste
is
surprising
not
as
tart
as
id
hoped
and
very
dry
lots
of
wood
there
interesting
how
much
pepper
is
present
very
nice
beer
that
fell
short
of
my
expectations
but
ill
definitely
give
it
another
shot
down
the
road
the
smell
is
very
intriguing
like
flowers
that
have
been
marinading
in
the
summer
sun
for
a
long
time
lemony
funk
musky
wood
mystery
flowers
all
really
really
well
combined
flavor
is
dustily
dry
lemony
sour
apple
floral
woody
musky
harmoniously
wacky
like
it
a
lot
bottom
line
either
the
bar
didnt
handle
the
keg
properly
or
this
varies
significantly
in
quality
over
batches
i
know
to
always
expect
variations
but
this
was
night
and
day
served
ontap
at
federal
taphouse
great
o
overall
a
very
very
good
gueuze
definitely
worth
the
pour
if
available
on
draft
othis
is
a
good
gueuze
but
not
my
favorite
it
doesnt
have
the
winelike
complexity
of
a
cantillon
for
example
but
that
does
not
mean
it
is
lacking
in
flavor
on
the
contrary
this
brew
packs
plenty
of
sour
punch
i
would
happily
drink
more
of
this
if
my
stomach
could
handle
the
acid
and
i
could
regularly
purchase
it
in
colorado
o
i
liked
this
version
it
has
all
of
the
flavors
i
would
expect
it
to
have
and
it
is
easy
to
consume
a
little
too
pricy
to
have
all
of
the
time
but
every
now
and
then
is
fine
with
me
poured
from
a
pitcher
due
to
its
large
ridiculously
thick
looking
rocky
head
its
more
of
a
hazy
slim
white
ring
by
the
time
i
get
my
pour
hazy
golden
body
funky
sour
lemon
aromas
along
with
barnyard
leather
slight
sweatiness
and
light
oak
crisp
tart
lemony
citrus
earth
a
sort
of
fresh
herbal
quality
and
hay
acidic
dry
and
massively
refreshing
with
a
slight
lingering
bitterness
delicious
lots
of
bright
fresh
flavor
for
4
8
pours
a
hazy
light
yellow
with
a
foamy
offwhite
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
foamy
rings
of
lace
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
sour
tart
and
funky
with
grain
and
acidic
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
sour
grain
flavor
on
the
finish
there
is
a
medium
amount
of
acidity
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
that
is
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
but
i
prefer
the
bottled
version
o
this
is
an
excellent
beer
so
easy
to
go
down
despite
low
abv
its
very
satisying
and
still
complex
this
peaked
my
interest
in
getting
the
bottled
version
when
i
have
the
chance
my
assumption
is
that
it
is
relatively
tamer
on
tap
but
that
doesnt
stop
it
from
being
delicious
this
is
a
gueuze
i
could
turn
myself
to
more
often
without
the
fear
of
getting
dried
out
by
all
its
acidity
how
the
brewmaster
figured
out
how
to
blend
a
beer
this
complex
and
make
it
so
drinkable
is
beyond
me
but
its
definitely
inspirational
dont
miss
a
chance
to
try
this
cloudy
copper
pour
with
a
finger
or
so
of
fluffy
white
head
that
sank
to
a
thin
layer
leaving
lots
of
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
was
funky
and
earthy
grassy
citrusy
the
taste
reflected
the
nose
funky
wet
grass
earthy
green
apple
lemon
with
an
expected
tartness
about
mediumbodied
moderate
carbonation
and
a
semisour
dry
finish
very
good
overall
taste
is
fantastic
for
the
style
its
a
little
more
malty
than
most
geuze
sweet
malts
and
the
citrusy
funk
blend
well
very
smooth
for
being
so
bitter
really
great
geuze
and
what
a
treat
to
have
on
tap
really
enjoyable
geuze
the
beer
is
copper
orange
mildly
hazy
with
a
half
inch
of
thick
white
head
that
coats
the
tumbler
in
lacing
the
aroma
is
bold
for
the
style
aggressive
and
forward
more
so
than
the
bottled
version
funky
earthy
dank
light
in
body
with
fairly
low
carbonation
smooth
on
the
palate
initially
finishing
zesty
with
a
touch
of
vinegary
sharpness
a
tasty
brew
i
would
have
this
again
d
aggressively
sour
but
also
a
bit
chewy
and
complex
this
is
a
geuze
that
let
me
contemplate
its
flavors
over
and
over
and
never
disappointed
the
smell
was
really
the
only
set
back
pours
a
hazy
gold
color
14
inch
head
of
a
white
color
sight
retention
and
slight
lacing
smells
of
pale
malt
strong
tartness
strong
sourness
and
a
hint
of
grapes
fits
the
style
of
a
gueuze
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
there
is
a
strong
acidity
and
tartness
there
is
no
noticeable
sugar
addition
tastes
of
slight
pale
malt
sharp
acidity
tartness
and
a
hint
of
grape
overall
good
appearance
aroma
body
and
feel
this
was
an
exciting
beer
to
try
its
a
mix
of
a
sour
lemon
character
and
an
oaky
backend
that
is
nothing
like
ive
had
before
i
definitely
get
the
lamic
qualities
but
it
also
shares
features
of
a
wild
ale
very
neat
beer
absolutely
worth
trying
but
its
rather
expensive
and
probably
isnt
one
youll
want
to
buy
often
comes
off
very
fresh
very
lightly
sour
but
enough
to
taste
refreshing
great
oak
flavor
excited
to
try
a
bottle
now
this
is
a
really
nice
gueuze
that
stayed
more
tart
than
sour
and
benefited
from
a
sprightly
feel
in
the
mouth
that
helped
keep
this
on
drinkable
side
im
glad
i
tried
this
one
quite
enjoyable
and
was
nice
to
try
something
i
hadnt
heard
of
the
taste
starts
with
a
tart
apple
and
slowly
an
almost
woody
earth
flavor
finishes
nice
had
on
tap
at
moeder
lambic
in
brussels
pour
is
mostly
transparent
straw
yellow
with
a
tight
off
white

the
nose
is
nice
huge
ridy
chessy
funk
light
mineral
note
sweet
peach
and
some
lemon
with
a
touch
of
citrusy
hop
the
taste
is
less
bright
notes
of

and
some
lighter
rindy
funk
light
spice
to
it
with
a
fair
bit
of
sweetness
in
the
back
light
lemon
and
very
subtle
sourness
the
body
is
light
and
airy
a
bit
active
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
not
very
dry
and
strong
carbonation
well
rounded
and
tasty
a
touch
flabby
not
as
expresssive
as
3f
but
decen
funk
should
have
a
strong
future
poured
a
light
seethru
brownish
body
with
some
white
head
and
lace
a
somewhat
sour
funky
aroma
i
pick
up
pears
grape
skin
and
touch
of
citric
hop
bitterness
in
aroma
and
very
little
malt
base
light
bodied
with
a
good
sour
funkiness
this
beer
isnt
overpowering
with
its
sour
peak
but
instead
mixes
sourness
with
tart
fruit
and
a
little
bit
of
oakiness
and
finishes
with
some
sweetness
relatively
speaking
casual
sipper
that
i
really
enjoyed
w
light
dinner
pours
a
hazy
golden
with
orange
highlights
stark
white
head
funky
tart
lemon
aroma
definite
barnyard
funk
funky
lemon
is
the
main
idea
here
moderate
carbonation
wheat
like
twang
leads
to
a
puckering
finish
lemon
is
the
main
note
in
this
tart
citrus
taste
touches
of
bread
and
honey
mid
palate
but
sour
start
to
finish
with
the
finish
being
very
dry
and
puckering
this
is
a
great
gueuze
not
metallic
notes
that
some
give
off
right
on
the
money
o
not
too
complex
but
its
a
really
nice
clean
sour
o
great
introduction
to
lambics
for
this
new
sour
appreciator
pleased
to
say
i
can
now
understand
the
fuss
over
sourfruity
beers
glad
to
have
tried
both
versions
i
found
the
bottle
version
more
to
my
liking
as
is
with
99
of
sours
that
i
come
across
especially
belgian
lambics
this
is
insanely
drinakble
though
was
lucky
enough
to
find
this
on
tap
at
a
local
spot
after
a
beer
festival
served
from
tap
into
a
trappe
door
tulip
poured
a
hazy
yellow
orange
with
a
one
finger
white
head
that
subsided
to
half
a
finger
very
slowly
maintained
nice
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
citrus
lemon
orange
peel
funk
slight
tart
and
earth
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
tart
funk
citrus
and
lemon
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
high
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
decent
brew
i
have
been
lucky
enough
to
try
this
both
on
draught
and
out
of
the
bottle
i
know
they
are
listed
separately
here
on
ba
which
was
confusing
to
me
at
first
however
after
trying
this
it
is
quite
clear
why
both
taste
completely
different
to
me
and
seem
to
be
completely
different
brews
i
enjoy
the
bottle
version
better
for
the
record
by
the
way
worth
trying
if
you
get
the
opportunity
cheers
o
as
close
to
a
perfect
example
of
this
style
that
ive
had
lighty
fizzy
oaky
and
citrusy
lemon
dry
wood
clean
dry
finish
fairly
straightforward
lemony
sourness
pulls
the
cheeks
inward
light
funky
flavors
dry
oak
in
the
end
overall
a
nice
alternative
to
3f
and
cantillon
somewhere
in
the
same
league
cant
wait
to
see
what
the
future
holds
for
tilquin
o
really
nice
beer
drank
it
side
by
side
with
cantillon
classic
gueuze
and
while
i
preferred
the
cantillon
this
one
held
its
own
o
impressive
we
had
this
one
sidebyside
with
cantillon
classic
gueuze
and
it
was
neckandneck
for
me
i
had
another
pour
after
the
first
one
really
liked
this
one
the
blender
knows
what
hes
doing
no
doubt
about
it
o
i
liked
this
but
the
bottled
version
certainly
seemed
to
be
better
to
me
this
was
very
quaffable
mediumbodied
with
just
under
medium
carbonation
woodytannic
and
dry
on
the
finish
perhaps
not
as
complex
as
some
of
the
other
gueuzes
out
there
but
this
is
a
good
showing
and
it
went
down
easily
d
a
solid
gueuze
that
i
enjoyed
a
fair
bit
probably
wont
order
this
often
at
9
a
glass
but
the
bottles
seem
competitively
priced
so
ill
give
those
a
shot
even
though
they
are
a
different
recipe
has
some
decidedly
unconventional
attributes
for
the
style
but
wont
be
unpleasant
for
those
weened
on
american
wild
ales
o
great
nose
and
a
little
sweet
but
very
drinkable
will
seek
this
out
again
o
overall
i
thought
this
was
an
awesome
gueuze
would
love
to
have
this
one
again
and
going
to
try
and
get
some
of
the
bottled
version
first
lambic
on
draft
for
me
lovely
lighter
medium
body
high
carbonation
extremely
dry
on
the
tongue
a
fantastic
gueuze
which
blends
sour
and
white
wine
into
a
delicious
concoction
on
tap
at
city
beer
store
pours
a
hazy
light
amber
with
a
small
white
head
the
aroma
is
light
barnyard
funk
some
light
lemon
grapefruit
hay
wheat
and
a
bit
of
oak
not
terribly
complex
with
the
flavors
being
much
lighter
than
in
some
other
lambics
the
initial
taste
is
lemon
going
into
a
bit
of
funky
oak
some
light
grapefruit
and
some
hay
a
brett
funkiness
on
the
finish
with
a
light
tartness
light
mouthfeel
with
low
carbonation
you
can
definitely
tell
this
is
younger
lambic
than
most
gueuzes
ill
be
curious
to
try
tilquin
gueuzes
made
from
3
year
lambic
this
was
enjoyable
but
not
quite
in
the
class
of
the
great
gueuzes
a
really
good
geuze
very
well
balanced
on
both
the
nose
and
palate
with
just
the
right
amount
of
funk
to
it
as
well
o
good
take
albeit
out
of
the
ordinary
on
a
blended
lambic
look
forward
to
future
more
mature
offerings
i
an
enjoyable
young
geuze
age
should
allow
the
acidity
and
tonguestinging
quality
to
subside
i
think
ill
be
needing
some
tums
id
love
to
see
what
else
rebecq
will
come
up
with
in
the
future
pretty
easy
to
drink
geuze
but
the
complex
funkiness
on
the
nose
didnt
translate
too
well
to
the
taste
overall
another
worldclass
gueuze
available
granted
i
love
true
lambics
more
than
my
own
soul
so
my
ratings
are
going
to
lean
high
even
though
i
am
trying
to
be
as
fair
as
possible
if
you
see
this
beverage
on
tap
dont
pass
on
it
hazy
yellow
pour
with
no
head
and
a
minimal
amount
of
bubbles
acidic
smell
with
hints
of
tart
cherries
undertones
of
vinegar
and
funk
the
taste
matches
the
smell
lightly
acidic
with
the
tart
cherries
providing
a
nice
balance
the
barnyard
funk
sort
of
holds
the
beer
together
and
is
not
overpowering
light
and
carbonated
well
dry
taste
overall
thought
this
was
a
great
beer
havent
had
many
guesses
before
this
was
a
nice
intro
o
a
solid
offering
looking
forward
to
tilquin
continuing
in
the
us
market
hopefully
both
the
draft
and
bottled
offerings
are
regulars
the
bottle
offering
is
better
in
my
book
its
clear
pierre
knows
what
he
is
doing
so
this
should
continue
to
improve
as
he
gets
more
blends
under
his
belt
a
mildly
hazy
yellow
with
a
thin
white
head
with
good
retention
this
is
a
goodlooking
gueuze
the
nose
is
surprisingly
great
the
girardin
is
quite
prominent
with
a
beautiful
clean
lemony
sourness
the
funk
character
is
mild
this
is
mostly
a
blend
of
lemon
and
orange
rind
the
palate
is
similarly
bright
and
refreshing
with
a
clean
lemony
sourness
a
mild
funk
and
a
little
bit
of
oak
mediumlight
in
body
this
beer
has
a
great
refreshing
finish
zippy
and
lemony
and
thoroughly
enjoyable
the
funk
isnt
as
fully
developed
here
but
i
guess
that
was
the
point
of
this
blend
well
done
o
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
compared
to
others
in
the
style
because
the
sourness
is
not
overpowering
o
this
was
a
fun
beer
to
drink
the
makers
of
true
gueuze
lambic
are
limited
so
its
always
fun
to
try
a
new
maker
of
the
style
true
to
belgium
and
true
to
its
place
id
love
to
see
more
from
tilquin
in
the
coming
months
note
after
this
i
came
to
find
this
beer
is
now
available
stateside
i
advise
anybody
into
gueuze
to
try
this
out
it
reminds
me
of
a
mix
between
3f
and
cantillon
classic
gueuzes
a
really
nice
beer
overall
with
a
light
enough
abv
this
drinks
so
quickly
like
nothing
and
hardly
any
sense
of
alcohol
a
mix
of
lemon
like
hefe
style
and
gueuze
like
goodness
and
a
marriage
to
enjoy
thats
what
i
get
off
of
it
a
very
impressive
beer
i
hope
to
have
this
more
often
o
it
shows
that
this
is
young
good
beer
for
a
hot
day
crisp
and
slightly
sweet
beer
is
bright
on
the
palate
and
dry
on
the
finish
light
in
body
effervescent
on
the
palate
a
fun
fun
beer
here
nice
round
body
pops
on
the
palate
i
enjoyed
it
but
probably
liked
the
oude
slightly
more
flavor
and
aroma
get
a
bump
in
the
bottle
much
more
sour
and
funky
glad
i
was
able
to
try
both
pale
yellow
and
slightly
cloudy
in
the
body
the
lace
is
quite
good
especially
for
a
gueuze
the
nose
is
spot
on
pleasant
with
some
horse
blanket
and
some
lemon
then
we
go
to
acid
city
which
is
the
taste
even
for
a
gueuze
this
is
acid
and
more
acid
bittering
with
traces
of
grass
and
very
subtle
lemon
not
bad
for
what
it
is
i
just
expected
something
a
little
different
from
what
i
got
o
a
bit
cold
straight
off
the
tap
and
obviously
young
but
quite
delicious
regardless
m
good
but
not
matured
enough
yet
and
balanced
i
will
revisit
this
gueuze
and
rewrite
my
review
i
dont
believe
gueuze
should
be
served
on
draft
when
i
drink
a
bottle
hopefully
ill
revise
this
for
the
better
very
nice
such
classic
characters
all
very
smooth
and
integrated
its
that
perfect
marriage
of
fresh
bite
and
aged
mellowness
fantastic
beer
overall
a
very
nice
and
enjoyable
beer
would
be
especially
good
when
the
weather
is
warm
overall
this
is
a
hot
summer
night
beer
made
for
drinking
not
thinking
the
price
belies
that
as
does
style
category
fail
but
still
drinkable
theres
not
much
to
say
except
that
this
doesnt
really
work
disappointingly
artificial
and
sweet
o
a
complete
misfigure
a
yellow
gueuze
that
doesnt
earn
this
name
an
ok
gueuze
but
not
the
best
example
ive
ever
tried
the
sugary
sweetness
doesnt
sit
all
that
well
and
doesnt
meld
properly
with
the
acidic
character
not
too
sure
about
the
addition
of
apples
either
this
adds
a
flavour
that
feels
like
it
doesnt
belong
i
also
found
the
excessive
floating
yeast
to
be
a
flaw
that
is
visually
unappealing
still
the
elements
of
lambic
are
present
and
it
would
probably
make
a
decent
starter
for
someone
new
to
the
style
this
is
not
a
gueuze
but
a
faro
even
though
they
make
a
faro
and
this
clearly
says
gueuze
on
the
label
i
find
that
hard
to
believe

a

beer
in

gueuze
traditional
there
is
really
not
a
whole
lot
going
on
in
this
beer
it
is
fairly
tart
though
certainly
not
on
the
hard
side
for
a
lambic
though
so
it
is
a
bit
puzzling
that
this
beer
is
so
clean
it
really
could
use
some
characteristic
funkiness
even
a
little
bit
of
brettanomyces
character
would
go
a
long
way
here
delicous
beer
that
is
perfect
for
a

i
cant
understand

a

i

my
overall
impression
of
this
beer
is
that
it
leans
towards
the
tart
and
acidic
end
of
the
scale
and
downplays
the
funky
character
found
in
several
other
gueuzes
thus
it
would
make
an
excellent
counter
point
to
others
as
part
of
a
tasting
session
involving
gueuze
from
several
breweries
alternatively
it
seems
a
fine
beer
for
having
with
a
meal
or
for
sharing
with
others
rather
than
being
something
to
be
consumed

overall

gueuze
thats
quite
refreshing
if
not
totally

blowing
less
intense
than
some
of
its
countryman
cousin
brews
however
still
on
the
puckering
side
of
the
ledger
as
an
aside
why
do
breweries
like
timmermans
and
lindemans
insist
on
pumping
out
heinous
syrupy
fruit
concoctions
when
they
are
capable
of
producing
a
solid
beer
like
this
surprisingly
i
drank
the
majority
of
the
bottle
yesterday
and
did
not
feel
any
alcohol
impacts
o
this
is
a
light
bright
well
blended
gueuze
that
leans
a
bit
more
toward
the
young
lambic
but
in
a
good
way
lots
of
soft
layers
that
is
very
drinkable
and
sessionable
aswell
worth
the
price
of
16
dollars
o
not
the
best
geuze
around
but
worth

made
me
want
to
drink
the
beer
distinct
smooth
sour
taste
that
progresses
to
a
tangy
citrus
flavor
with
a
dry
tart
finish
very
refreshing
taste
that
i
really
enjoyed
light
to
medium

with
lots
of

almost

overall
an
excellent
sour
that
is
one
of
my
favorites
this
bottle
is
from
2010
and
pours
a
very
hazy
golden
hue
with
a

head
and

and
finished
with
a

and
overall
its
nicely
paired
with
my
fish
and
chips
but
not
one
for
the
first
timers
cheers
overall
not
for
beginners
and
perhaps
not
as
funky
as
others
this
is
quite
a
tart
acetic
experience
overall
a
nice
gueuze
thats
enjoyable
but
by
no
means
in
the
top
tier
for
the
style
timmermans
can
produce
a
straight
up
funky
sour
bomb
of
a
gueuze
its
a
shame
that
for
years
their
standard
offerings
have
been
of
the
overly
sweetened
fruit
beer
type
ive
heard
this
is
the
best
of
the
bunch
but
i
enjoy
the
gueuze
so
much
the
kriek
will
be
purchased
on
my
next
trip
to
the
store
a
damn
fine
gueuze
worth
keeping
on
hand
a
very
good
gueuze
tasty
and
solid
probably
the
best
beer
ive
had
from
timmermans
recommended
the
best
ive
had
from
timmermans
or
one
of
them
this
blended
lambic
is
really
well
done
with
notes
of
oak
and
lemony
lactic
funk
in
the
nose
and
taste
without
caustic
tartness
of
others
light
hazy
rusty
golden
color
with
a
soda

head
on
it

white
but
short
lived
the
nose
is
all
lemony
funk
and
wood
i
get
a
pinch
of
pale
wheat
malt
but
its
awfully
light
made
even
lighter
in
the
taste
by
fierce
carbonation
a
nice
blend
of
flavors
tartness
and
sharpness
of
young
lambic
up
front
with
the
more
refined
yeasty
dryness
of
mature
lambic
on
the
back
end
quality
acid
is
there
but
not
as
puckery
as
so
many
gueuze
beers
more
approachable
for
the
uninitiated
i
think
a
little
light
for
me
on
the
body
which
may
be
a
product
of
slight
overcarbonation
but
it
really
does
work
clean
finishing
for
the
style
too
a
little
expensive
on
shelves
but
a

no

finishing
off
the
bottle
timmermans
exquisite
oude
gueuze
demonstrates
whats
best
about
the
blend
of
lambics
that
prefer
more
of
a
younger
and
tarter
taste
over
that
of
the
more
elden
leather
and
must
although
i
often
enjoy
a
pep
of
vinegar
in
such
beers
its
seem
that
this
ale
avoids
such
polarizing
taste
and
prefers
the
effects
of
cellarlike
brettanomyces
and
the
clean
lactic
tartness
of
lactobacillus
instead
clean
and
dry
sour
refreshments
are
the
rewards
tart
puckering
and
way
more
sour
than
i
expected
strong
sour
acidity
but
not
harsh
or
acetic
dry
with
crisp
champagnelike
effervescence
and
a
very
strong
citric
acid
flavor
prominent
lemon
juice
flavor
with
lingering
acetic
vinegar
but
its
not
solvent
like
at
all
slightly
earthy
and
musty
with
a
decent
lactic
presence
but
overall
not
too
funky
some
light
fruit
sweetness
as
well
feels
like
there
is
some
artificial
sweetners
in
there
dry
finish
decent
sourness
but
not
very
complex
and
the
mouthfeel
falls
off
toward
the
end
of
the
palate
a
decent
attempt
at
the
style
but
kind
of
tameonce
your
palate
adjusts
to
the
initial
sour
shock
and
one
dimensional
sourness
comes
out
of
nowhere
on
this
one
and
lays
a
surprising
slap
across
my
face
in
a
good
way
acidic
to
be
sure
but
doesnt
hold
the
malt
and
overall
complexity
many
of
the
finer
gueuzes
show
i
figured
the
brett
would
be
stronger
than
the
bacteria
based
on
the
nose
but
it
is
exactly
the
opposite
here
the
brett
is
hidden
on
this
one
all
that
said
i
am
enjoying
this
one
more
than
i
thought
i
would
and
for
someone
who
hasnt
met
a
beer
that
is
too
sour
it
fits
the
bill
well
i
like
it
in
fact
i
think
i
will
pick
up
a
couple
more
more
intense
than
cuvee
rene
though
not
as
well
rounded
d
tastes
ok
but
it
isnt
too
impressive
on
the
whole
o
what
a
bite
it
was
worth
a
try
but
not
one
id
go
back
to
hazy
and
golden
pours
with
a
very
healthy
head
for
a
lambic
aroma
of
bubble
gum
and
sour
cherries
very
tart
dry
and
light
bodied
high
carbonation
sour
grain
with
some
slight
sour
fruit
and
oak
at
the
finish
leans
toward
the
sour
side
even
for
lambics
d
this
was
a
great
gueuze
but
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
or
anyone
who
isnt
already
a
fan
of
this
sour
style
it
had
wonderfully
bold
but
complex
scent
and
taste
it
showed
an
old
world
character
that
most
modern
sours
cant
replicate
the
body
was
perfect
for
the
style
helping
make
it
easier
to
drink
despite
the
intense
finish
would
likely
age
for
decades
and
would
probably
improve
with
extra
time
impressive
overall
a
solid
example
of
a
gueuze
though
nothing
that
stands
out
above
the
rest
got
this
on
sale
for
6
99
and
im
glad
i
did
for
that
price
id
buy
another
this
beer
poured
a
nice
light
gold
color
with
a
small
white
frothy
head
that
dissipates
quickly
the
smell
is
very
sour
with
hints
of
lemon
and
musty
tastes
very
sour
and
bitter
with
a
dry
crisp
finish
could
use
some
sugar
to
cut
the
intense
sourness
of
the
lambicus
light
body
and
easy
to
drink
pretty
refreshing
o
one
of
the
good
gueuze
i
havent
had
a
ton
of
gueuze
but
this
is
not
my
favorite
way
too
dry
and
one
dimensional
i
like
my
lambiques
with
a
touch
more
sweetness
to
counteract
the
acidity
and
with
more
malt
character
it
doesnt
taste
like
pure
bile
like
jolly
pumpkins
entire
lineup
but
its
not
far
removed
i
wouldnt
bother
buying
this
again
and
wouldnt
recommended
it
even
to
people
who
like
lambics
poured
from
a
750ml
bottle
into
a
tulip
glass
produced
on
41712
this
pours
a
slightly
light
yellow
straw
color
with
a
massive
off
white
head
which
quickly
dissipates
and
leaves
nothing
the
smells
are
of
funk
vinegar
ripe
cherries
malt
the
feel
is
medium
with
high
carbonination
the
taste
is
good
very
vinegar
like
sour
some
funk
maybe
a
little
brett
very
acidic
my
girlfriend
thought
it
reminder
her
of
bile
i
find
it
quite
good
though
overall
tart
and
tart
but
refreshing
and
drinkable
nonetheless
there
are
not
a
ton
of
gueuzes
available
in
the
united
states
so
i
will
take
what
we
can
get
o
this
is
a
very
nice
gueze
really
like
the
tartness
and
the
way
the
mouthfeel
works
with
this
brew
if
your
a
fan
of
a
good
gueze
deffiantly
give
this
a
whirl
the
smell
and
taste
were
of
bruised
cooking
apples
that
had
gone
sour
vinegarous
from
start
to
finish
even
the
most
toothless
cider
freak
i
know
would
have
had
trouble
finnishing
off
this
brew
glad
i
didnt
pay
much
for
it
and
also
glad
i
opened
it
with
family
and
not
beer
geek
mates
i
saw
this
for
12
49
at
a
store
and
said
fuck
it
glad
i
did
there
was
a
huge
pop
when
i
opened
it
and
then
the
bottle
started
gushing
the
first
wine
glass
i
poured
up
was
bright
yellow
with
a
huge
white
pillow
of
a
head
im
used
to
gueuze
being
orange
but
this
was
quite
yellow
aroma
was
interesting
brett
and
a
bit
of
mineral
the
flavor
was
nice
hint
of
brett
mildly
sour
touch
of
lemon
very
much
a
gueuze
but
also
struck
me
as
being
similar
to
jolly
pumpkin
bam
biere
weird
overall
i
am
glad
i
picked
this
up
but
wont
be
buying
any
more
i
will
say
that
this
might
be
a
tad
better
than
cuvee
rene
but
is
not
close
to
the
hanssensgirardincantillon3ftilquin
level
pours
a
murky
light
orange
with
a
foamy
bone
colored
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
slowly
drip
into
the
remaining
beer
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
sour
tart
and
funky
with
some
acidic
and
fruity
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
an
acidic
finish
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
o
a
flavorful
well
balanced
gueuze
solid
but
not
extraordinary
o
a
pretty
good
gueuze
would
seek
it
out
again
as
well
as
the
other
timmermans
gueuzes
o
overall
a
really
nice
funky
and
tart
gueuze
nose
is
funkier
and
the
taste
is
tarter
but
i
liked
it
quite
a
bit
would
certainly
buy
this
again
i
was
surprised
by
this
one
good
stuff
o
easy
to
drink
especially
for
the
style
this
would
be
a
good
beer
for
someone
to
get
started
in
this
style
due
to
the
light
amount
of
tartness
very
refreshing
and
even
sessionable
probably
the
only
beer
in
this
style
that
i
have
said
that
about
enjoyable
and
i
would
be
happy
to
drink
this
one
again
o
even
with
a
very
careful
pour
pouring
this
resulted
in
approximately
90
percent
head
and
10
percent
beer
its
quite
easy
to
drink
and
is
especially
refreshing
when
compared
to
other
beers
in
the
style
smells
like
a
funky
tripel
but
drinks
like
a
wellblended
and
delicate
gueuze
its
definitely
something
special
ill
probably
round
up
another
couple
bottles
before
it
disappears
overall
pretty
nice
nice
acidity
nice
funk
good
tart
fruit
dry
tasty
but
a
little
yeasty
its
a
fairly
good
gueuze
but
not
phenomenal
compare
to
many
of
the
others
you
can
get
for
about
the
same
price
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
i
love
sours
and
this
is
the
extreme
version
of
a
sour
drink
its
a
nice
queuze
but
doesnt
leave
me
saying
omg
lacked
a
bit
of
funk
but
had
a
nice
sourlactic
flavor
i
think
with
time
this
could
become
amazing
o
this
was
decent
enough
to
drink
but
too
much
sweetness
and
a
frothy
mouthfeel
detract
from
the
experience
the
pleasant
funk
in
the
aroma
is
nowhere
to
be
found
in
the
taste
also
overall
this
is
a
great
gueze
for
the
price
will
buy
this
again
if
i
can
get
it
o
a
good
sour
beer
the
lack
of
funk
and
socalled
belgian
terrior
makes
this
taste
a
lot
more
american
than
most
belgomade
gueuzes
pricey
but
its
nice
to
see
another
true
gueuze
on
the
market
i
rarely
open
bottled
with
them
pointed
away
but
i
was
at
the
dentists
and
wanted
to
do
it
classy
style
so
i
pointed
it
away
from
me
and
as
soon
as
the
cage
was
twisted
loose
the
cork
fired
out
and
made
a
dent
in
the
siding
of
the
house
fucking
ridiculous
didnt
foam
over
much
though
pours
a
turbid
tangerine
yellow
with
some
fleeting
white
foam
nose
is
funky
and
sour
with
plenty
of
co2
lemon
and
pepper
flavor
is
nicely
tart
without
being
puckering
grain
and
hot
carb
with
some
soda
flavor
and
a
good
bit
of
metal
and
brett
flavor
thin
with
hi
carb
and
sharp
off
dry
finish
meh
for
a
gueuze
this
isnt
really
up
my
alley
overall
the
taste
profile
is
good
but
its
based
on
the
citrus
notes
and
lacks
the
complexity
of
the
very
upper
echelon
but
the
price
is
very
good
for
a
gueuze
and
while
it
has
simple
flavor
profile
its
a
good
tasting

subsided

the
aroma
on
this
one
was
pretty
inviting
and
really
nice
the
flavor
was
the
standout
on
this
brew
as
it
was
really
nice
and
acidic
as
you
would
expect
from
the
style
all
the
right
flavors
were
present
and
made
themselves
known
a
definite
must
try
if
you
get
the
opportunity
o
compared
to
some
of
the
other
gueuzes
we
were
drinking
this
one
was
not
up
to
par
it
had
some
good
qualities
but
i
doubt
i
would
spend
a
bunch
of
money
to
get
one
for
myself
d
really
drinkable
and
shockingly
good
for
a
timmermans
product
my
friends
liked
this
quite
a
bit
even
though
they
were
lambic
n00bs
it
lacks
the
complexity
of
some
of
the
best
lambics
but
its
competitive
with
boon
hanssens
et
al
overall
this
seems
to
be
a
fairly
underrepresented
and
underrated
gueuze
pleasurable
and
generally
on
target
across
the
board
though
not
perfect
compared
to
cantillon
drie
fonteinen
etc
would
definitely
pick
one
up
again
if
available
and
in
the
mood
retailed
14
99
for
a
750cl
bottle
whereas
a
bottle
of
girardin
drie
fonteinen
or
other
gueuze
are
that
price
for
a
375cl
bottle
this
is
a
light
bodied
brew
with
an
excessive
amount
of
carbonation
it
is
very
lively
and
bubbly
in
the
feel
the
alcohol
is
seemingly
nonexistent
fairly
decent
across
the
board
but
on
a
day
like
this
it
paled
in
comparison
to
some
of
the
other
geuze
offerings
sampled
the
flavor
is
mild
yet
pleasant
in
most
ways
with
dry
wheat
sourness
with
lemony
sweet
tart
and
low
puckering
flavor
there
is
a
mild
sweet
pineapple
tinge
with
gentle
spice
accent
and
slight
hint
of
honey
along
with
the
sour
notes
overall
a
very
good
beer
i
was
pleased
to
try
the
drinkability
is
pretty
high
even
if
it
is
not
over
the
top
in
the
sour
department
golden

yellow
hue
solid
mouth
watering

good

wet
wood
and
mold
straw
lemons
and
dusty
library
books
flavors
are
mouth
puckering
and
tasty
lemon
and
modest
funk
medium
body
the
rest
of
the
timmermans
line
is
garbage
but
this
is
a
shining
star
very
worthy
gueuze
in
my
book
mouthfeel
is
dry
and
smooth
overall
pretty
good
pours
a
clear
gold
body
with
a
white
head
acidic
funky
aroma
with
notes
of
green
apple
the
flavor
is
nica
and
sour
the
acid
is
medium
soft
which
keeps
it
from
being
overly
aggressive
crisp
carbonation
perfectly
pairs
with
the
acidity
not
the
most
complex
or
layered
gueuze
but
is
has
an
enjoyable
sourness
to
it
with
some
nice
fruit
character
would
make
an
excellent
intro
to
the
style
opinion
overall
this
is
a
pretty
decent
example
of
the
style
i
certainly
prefer
a
gueuze
that
is
more
on
the
wild
side
and
makes
you
pucker
this
one
is
not
quite
a
sweet
as
lindemans
gueuze
not
the
cuvee
renee
but
it
is
getting
close
i
guess
this
one
is
made
more
to
appeal
to
the
masses
which
is
fine
i
will
stick
with
girardin
and
such
if
i
want
a
gueuze
to
savor
overall
pretty
impressed
this
is
much
better
than
the
fruit
lambics
released
by
this
brewery
thin
body
with
bubbly
carbonation
very
dry
finish
overall
a
very
tasty
gueuze
very
acidic
lots
of
citrus
overall
an
interesting
lambic
for
sure
never
had
one
with
so
much
citrus
acid
not
as
funky
as
i
thought
it
would
be
not
getting
much
funky
brett
its
definitely
a
great
great
extremely
acidic
beverage
i
think
that
the
high
level
of
carbonation
takes
away
from
the
depth
of
flavors
that
may
be
deep
in
this
beer
i
wouldnt
hesitate
to
buy
this
again
when
i
want
something
extremely
acidic
overall
i
really
wanted
to
like
this
one
but
its
a
bit
of
a
mess
imho
going
to
try
some
other
gueze
here
next
and
hope
they
are
better
dont
recommend
rotation
avail
now
in
tx
rotation
one
was
enough
nn
the
beer
pours
a
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
full
of
wheat
with
some
tart
lemons
belgian
yeast
and
some
light
funk
a
very
nice
smelling
gueuze
the
flavor
is
very
tart
and
acidic
i
get
a
lot
of
sour
lemons
notes
as
well
as
some
horseblanket
funk
wheat
and
belgian
yeast
there
is
also
a
little
bit
of
white
pepper
mixed
into
the
flavor
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
a
very
nice
gueuze
glad
to
have
this
one
available
here
in
texas
the
flavor
is
overcome
with
a
strong
citric
and
lactic
acidity
green
apple
is
strong
as
is
the
lemon
rind
character
the
funk
is
basically
gone
leaving
behind
an
acidic
brew
without
any
real
complexity
light
body
and
high
carbonation
brisk
acidic
finish
decent
enough
but
not
something
i
would
go
after
again
not
a
very
good
gueuze
i
dont
prefer
the
lactic
cheesy
stuff
and
this
beer
had
other
crazy
things
going
on
poured
from
a
750
into
a

i

again
before

99
a
bottle
i
dont
know
if
i
can
finish
this
750
by
myself

every
sip
leaves
me
wanting
more
t
decent
beer
spritzy
horseblanket
middle

but
respectable
not
incredibly
dry
but
good
late
taste
pucker
factor
olower
carbonation
and
a
bit
more
attention
paid
to
the
more
nuanced
flavors
would
make
a
big
difference
gueuze
is
all
about
nuance
and
this
beer
is
very
blustery
and
to
the
point
still
this
beer
is
leaps
and
bounds
above
every
other
beer
ive
had
from
timmermans
o
a
respectable
but
underwhelming
gueuze
considering
other
offerings
on
the
market
d
a
big
sour
profile
i
am
rather
impressed
with
this
considering
timmermans
very
poor
fruited
lambic
line
i
look
forward
to
seeing
what
time
will
do
to
this
one
o
a
good
gueuze
but
not
a
great
one
nicely
sour
and
refreshing
though
o
this
was
pretty
fresh
and
very
sour
because
its
so
fresh
id
like
to
see
what
a
couple
of
years
would
do
to
this
one
o
not
a
bad
gueuze
especially
at
the
entry
level
competes
quite
well
with
lindemans
cuvee
rene
and
i
think
gets
the
slight
edge
at
this
moment
pretty
refreshing
sour
for
the
summertime
not
to
mention
that
it
is
affordable
and
fairly
easy
to
get
as
well
not
the
best
but
certainly
a
well
made
beer
glad
to
see
timmermans
can
still
turn
out
a
traditional
product
this
far
surpasses
any
of
their
lowtier
sweetened
fruit
sodas
masquerading
as
lambic
a
very
nice
yellowgold
with
a
dense
white
head
with
great
retention
and
lacing
this
is
a
nice
looking
gueuze
the
nose
otoh
is
rather
awful
smells
like
corn
or
to
be
more
accurate
korn
vegetal
sweet
and
harsh
with
a
solvent
character
this
is
rather
nasty
the
palate
is
similar
sweet
sour
and
lemony
with
oxidized
malt
and
for
a
first
for
me
at
least
from
a
gueuze
this
is
even
a
little
flabby
some
early
reviews
mention
plenty
of
lactic
character
that
is
not
something
i
found
in
my
bottle
sour
and
drying
with
a
little
sweetness
on
the
finish
this
is
rather
bad
so
bad
in
fact
that
i
think
im
being
generous
with
my
grades
golden
hue
with
no
head
and
a
white
collar
around
the
liquid
very
tiny
bubbles
of
carbonation
it
tingles
the
tongue
very
turbid
looking
gueuze
almost
i
wonder
what
it
would
take
to
clear
this
beer
after
reading
reviews
smells
eggy
and
lactic
it
tasted
a
little
one
dimensional
odd
for
a
gueuze
more
like
an
unblended
lambic
tastes
unrefined
and
doesnt
seem
like
a
gueuze
to
me
thanks
to
todd
for
sharing
this
one
with
me
hazy
golden
pour
with
a
thick
and
fizzy
egg
shell
colored
head
aroma
is
white
grapes
green
apples
and
white
wine
tart
and
refreshing
not
super
complex
but
still
really
solid
if
this
was
an
american
sour
or
gueze
it
would
be
extremely
hyped
bottle
poured
a
medium
slightly
hazy
yellow
color
lambic
with
a
huge
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
very
good
lacing
aroma
of
light
barnyard
notes
with
nice
tart
notes
and
some
very
light
oak
taste
is
a
nice
refreshing
mix
between
notes
of
tart
and
oak
with
a
mix
of
green
apple
and
light
barnyard
notes
body
is
about
average
with
great
carbonation
not
the
most
complex
lambic
out
there
but
a
thousand
time
better
then
the
other
crap
they
brew
somewhat
reminiscent
of
girardin
as
a
very
refreshing
lambic
though
lacking
the
complexity
i
perhaps
prefer
my
gueuzes
to
have
a
touch
more
complexity
a
bit
more
bracing
acidity
and
be
more
funky
but
this
is
still
a
very
nice
gueuze
if
this
were
widely
available
it
would
easily
give
the
newer
vintages
of
lindemans
gueuze
cuvée
rené
a
run
for
their
money
a
very
enjoyable
beer
especially
for
anyone
who
loves
lambics
d
a
nice
well
balanced
gueuze
that
has
a
little
of
everything
in
a
gueuze
this
may
be
a
good
first
time
gueuze
since
it
isnt
quite
as
dry
as
cantillons
gueuzes
slightly
aggressive
carbonation
on
the
tongue
for
the
most
part
very
carbonated
easy
to
drink
overall
even
with
the
level
of
acidity
although
a
whole
bottle
might
hurt
in
the
end
this
cork
came
off
more
fiercely
than
any
other
one
i
have
ever
seen
thank
goodness
it
was
not
pointing
at
anybody
only
lost
four
to
five
ounces
thankfully
originally
i
was
told
this
was
an
older
vintage
which
is
partially
true
it
is
an
older
lambic
but
it
was
bottled
this
year
for
the
celebration
of
spontaneous
fermentation
in
may
it
was
made
in
very
limited
quantities
and
will
only
be
brewed
one
time
wish
i
had
more
as
i
think
this
one
will
be
even
better
once
it
has
some
age
under
its
belt
in
the
bottle
too
recommended
food
match
sour
beers
are
interesting
to
match
for

they

that
must
be

equally
mouth
watering
food
filet

wrapped
with

a
side

nose
of

that
hints
at
the
sourness
to
come
the
first
sip
is
mouth
puckeringly
sour
but
a

of
sips
in
and
youre
fine
kind
of
cidery

also
champagnelike
at
the

time
in

with
a

to
it
flavour
is
mouth
filling
and
pleasant
the
complexity
is

im

is
dry
but
not
near
as
sour
as
i
had
hoped
this
if
a
funkier
gueuze
rather
than
a
mouth
puckering
one
actually
even
sweetens
up
by
the
end
dry
somewhat
acidic
and
slightly
sweet
mouthfeel
thin
bodied
overly
carbonated
and
definitely
gushed
when
it
was
popped
aftertaste
did
not
last
long
easy
to
drink
and
very
light
overall
no
alcohol
in
the
flavor
always
a
winner
maybe
ill
rereview
with
a
fresher
sample
at
a
later
date
this
is
highly
drinkable
actually
i
was
expecting
it
to
be
much
more
sour
and
tarty
a
style
ill
be
looking
out
for
more
of
crisp
light
long
sour
touch
with
light
body
good
light
mouthfeel
goes
down
nicely
but
for
me
its
definitely
a
sipper
not
something
im
going
to
drink
much
of
but
enjoyable
on
occasion
this
beer
poured
an
odd
yellow
with
a
large
head
which
went
away
within
a
few
moments
smell
was
very
odd
almsot
had
a
chardonnay
aroma
to
it
that
i
have
never
seen
in
a
beer
taste
was
also
very
odd
but
in
a
good
way
never
have
i
tasted
a
brew
that
was
so
tart
yet
sweet
at
the
same
time
again
white
wine
flavors
were
dominant
with
some
vanilla
and
oak
tastes
coming
through
too
mouthfeel
was
light
bodied
which
made
it
a
very
easy
beer
to
drink
i
could
certainly
see
myself
drinking
a
few
on
a
hot
day
final
comments
a
beer
that
everybody
should
try
at
least
once
the
fact
that
it
has
so
many
interesting
complexities
makes
it
totally
worth
it
a
drinkable
gueuze
but
just
too
sweet
to
be
anything
outstanding
or
particularly
memorable
overall
a
good
and
very
drinkable
gueuze
not
the
best
example
in
the
world
but
certainly
recommended
thanks
for
the
sampling
stopper
this
is
a
really
nice
gueuze
with
a
great
farmy
profile
of
funky
yeasts
and
bacteria
especially
in
the
aroma
and
a
substantial
and
delicious
fruity
sourness
without
being
abrasively
tart
drinkability
only
average
at
vest
the
appearance
and
smell
were
good
and
then
it
was
downhill
from
there
actually
really
quite
nice
sweeter
and
thinnner
than
some
of
the
better
gueuzes
and
more
assertive
ones
sweetish
start
sour
finish
light
refreshing
grassy
and
citric
i
quite
like
it
more
of
a
session
gueuze
thin
laces
with
some
crackle
clear
pale
amber
hue
due
to
leaving
the
dregs
behind
whoa
barnyard
funk
with
some
tartness
and
is
somewhere
between
lemon
juice
table
wine
and
balsamic
vinegar
lighter
bodied
with
a
bit
of
crispness
an
in
your
face
tartness
throughout
mimics
the
nose
funk
and
tartness
seem
very
well
blended
not
as
sour
as
i
expected
but
it
hits
the
right
level
here
simply
amazing
its
a
good
take
at
the
lambic
style
but
calling
it
a
lambic
and
gueuze
just
rubs
me
the
wrong
way
tradionalist
and
also
gives
me
an
excuse
to
compare
it
directly
to
real
lambics
which
of
course
it
still
has
a
long
way
to
go
a
very
solid
spontaneously
fermented
ale
from
two
roads
mouth
bit
flemmy
lighter
decent
carb
decent
acidity
pour
yielded
loose
bubbles
no
head
light
funk
juicy
citrus
and
oak
character
in
the
aroma
big
notes
of
tart
lemon
that
are
mellowed
mid
palate
with
oakvanilla
from
the
barrels
dry
with
a
light
mouthfeel
undercarbed
on
tap
which
detracted
a
bit
from
the
overall
mouthfeel
im
sure
carbonation
will
not
be
an
issue
in
the
bottles
overall
this
is
an
exceptional
american
wild
ale
that
holds
like
characteristics
to
belgian
lambic
sampled
at
the
brewerys
2014
quintessence
tasting
on
1
may
2014
what
an
incredible
event
my
group
of
friends
were
the
first
to
try
it
this
was
a
surprise
offering
at
a
local
restaurant
that
has
been
steadily
been
improving
their
beer
resume
i
enjoyed
it
with
a
chicken
and
swiss
spin
on
a
philly
cheese
steak
yea
sure
that
sounds
like
a
misnomer
or
an
oxymoron
but
who
cars
it
was
good
and
a
welcome
break
from
christmas
preparations
o
again
the
concept
is
probably
more
important
than
the
blend
itself
i
was
extremely
pleased
with
this
beer
and
am
very
appreciative
that
it
was
not
for
sale
it
would
of
removed
some
magic
from
the
event
to
see
hoarders
line
up
with
their
friends
and
family
to
collect
as
many
bottles
as
they
could
everyone
at
quintessence
was
able
to
sample
this
wonderful
beer
and
there
was
no
frenzy
to
get
into
the
line
for
this
beer
not
a
huge
difference
from
regular
but
i
love
regular
also

2010
vintage
some
barnyard
funk
in
the
aroma
taste
was
very
funky
but
easy
to
drink
would
like
to
try
it
fresh
2001
vintage
great
representation
of
the
style
overall
good
stuff
all
around
found
this
to
be
much
fruitier
and
slightly
acidic
compared
to
the
dank
and
musty
regular
gueuze
which
is
a
big
plus
in
my
book
something
i
could
easily
polish
off
over
an
evening
and
one
i
hope
to
enjoy
again
in
the
near
future
huge
thanks
to
thirtybird
for
this
one
2010
vintage
served
in
a
hill
farmstead
taster
pours
a
goldenorange
hue
with
a
frothy
bright
white
head
that
dissipates
into
a
sudsy
slick
clarity
is
semihazy
nose
is
musty
and
expresses
citrus
zest
and
cork
the
taste
on
this
beer
is
very
good
but
not
mindblowing
given
the
ratings
i
get
cork
citrus
rind
and
citric
acid
however
nothing
really
stands
out
mouthfeel
is
light
in
body
with
a
lively
carbonation
and
a
pleasant
astringency
overall
a
solid
gueuze
but
not
my
favorite
cantillon
perhaps
a
little
more
time
in
the
cellar
was
needed
overall
a
solid
geuze
no
doubt
the
taste
is
very
nice
but
its
fairly
mellow
i
think
it
could
really
use
a
bit
more
sour
strength
or
funkiness
id
be
interested
in
tasting
a
few
vintages
together
to
really
get
a
feel
for
this
one
overall
my
white
whale
an
excellent
gueuze
i
think
id
take
a
3f
over
it
but
its
remarkable
o
this
is
a
bigtime
sour
sour
not
for
the
faint
non
sour
hearted
this
is
worth
the
pricehasslepatience
really
lots
of
stuff
going
on
with
the
bacteria
and
wild
belgium
yeast
makes
this
topshelf
i
did
get
a
strong
vinegar
smell
and
taste
but
that
comes
with
the
territory
this
beer
is
mainly
a
gueuze
yet
it
has
been
flavored
it
is
hard
to
pinpoint
flavors
but
sour
apples
are
present
it
does
not
deviate
much
from
a
gueuze
though
pours
a
reddish
beer
just
like
a
lou
pepe
but
it
does
look
a
bit
lighter
as
it
pours
little
foam
smell
is
funky
it
is
a
light
yet
syrupy
beer
not
very
sour
like
other
gueuzes
bright
lemons
green
apple
are
the
tart
flavors
as
a
barnyard
funk
hits
the
middle
a
mild
honeyed
sweetness
at
the
end
balances
the
beer
out
and
cuts
away
from
the
upfront
tart
a
must
try
gueuze
o
very
tasty
and
exceedingly
drinkable
at
5
and
with
such
light
tartness
among
the
lp
versions
i
think
the
kriek
is
my
favorite
this
is
about
as
good
as
3f
og
off
the
top
of
my
head
i
cant
distinguish
this
and
classic
gueuze
overall
this
is
my
favorite
of
the
lou
pepe
series
fram
and
kriek
are
also
amazing
but
a
gueuze
is
the
perfect
style
for
cantillion
funk
i
think
this
is
far
superior
to
cantillion
classic
gueuze
this
beer
is
in
my
top
5
gueuze
that
i
have
tried
cantillion
lpg
is
not
quite
as
good
as
but
gets
close
to
3f
lente
3f
golden
blend
and
bullfrog
vertiable
gueuze
o
stellar
outstanding
flavor
profile
with
a
nearperfect
mouthfeel
the
best
example
of
the
style
ive
had
pours
clear
golden
colored
with
a
small
white
fluffy
head
aroma
is
of
the
lemon
peel
and
mint
leaf
kind
that
i
get
from
a
lot
of
gueuze
some
dry
dusty
oak
funky
yeast
very
nice
flavor
is
pretty
funky
lacto
sour
with
lemon
peels
super
dusty
dryness
oak
some
other
citrus
notes
hay
excellent
like
this
better
than
the
classic
gueuze
version
body
is
very
light
with
medium
plus
carbonation
and
super
easy
drinking
one
of
the
finest
ive
had
from
cantillon
and
the
three
years
age
has
added
a
good
amount
of
funk
quite
perfect
at
the
moment
or
is
it
this
hot
weather
as
of
late
this
zomer
and
duck
duck
gooze
are
my
favorite
among
the
style
could
drink
this
all
day
everyday
midpalate
is
full
of
complexity
while
the
finish
is
a
lot
cleaner
its
that
clean
finish
that
makes
this
so
drinkable
look
forward
to
revisiting
this
soon
the
softer
acidity
and
high
complexity
make
this
one
that
id
love
to
drink
regularly
but
as
a
difficulttoland
special
occasion
gueuze
it
doesnt
necessarily
bring
the
fireworks
750ml
corked
and
capped
the
belt
and
suspenders
approach
a
2010
vintage
normally
id
talk
appearance
first
but
the
moment
you
open
the
bottle
there
is
this
fantastic
vinegar
wood
sugar
smell
pouring
it
into
the
glass
i
get
more
candi
sugar
lemons
apricots
nice
nice
nice
the
pour
is
a
hazy
gold
with
a
very
active
head
that
settles
into
a
nice
creamy
layer
and
then
leaves
just
a
hint
of
lacing
taste
is
absolutely
incredible
it
starts
with
an
orange
lemon
citrus
flavor
then
a
nice
chewy
sour
followed
by
a
woody
dryness
there
is
a
lot
going
on
in
this
beer
the
aftertaste
is
almost
vanilla
and
very
pleasant
the
mouthfeel
is
nicely
carbonated
and
then
almost
sticky
very
nice
and
adds
to
the
overall
feeling
of
substantialness
overall
what
can
i
say
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
best
gueuzes
ive
ever
had
hands
down
one
of
the
best
examples
of
a
gueuze
i
have
ever
tried
amazing
drink
this
was
a
fantastic
gueuze
would
love
to
let
this
one
sit
for
a
while
and
see
what
happens
light
amber
in
color
with
a
bit
of
haziness
a
minuscule
layer
of
off
white
foam
covers
the
majority
of
the
top
of
the
beer
aroma
of
pineapple
and
green
apples
is
very
compelling
the
body
is
moderately
carbonatedcrispand
dry
the
front
of
the
palate
is
sharp
with
a
champagne
like
taste
that
quickly
tuns
to
pineapple
and
green
apple
with
a
quick
dry
finish
very
refreshing
this
is
of
course
wonderful
gueuze
but
given
the
hype
surrounding
it
and
in
the
context
of
a
number
of
other
comparable
versions
more
readily
available
on
the
market
it
just
didnt
wow
me
like
i
expected
it
to
thanks
as
usual
to
drlovemd87
for
procuring
this
and
choosing
to
share
it
with
me
its
pale
blonde
to
straw
in
color
and
i
can
see
bubbles
but
it
never
amasses
any
head
this
is
a
2009
vintage
by
the
way
and
its
got
a
great
nose
of
funky
oak
lacto
and
white
wheat
malt
that
has
stood
the
test
of
time
the
funk
is
there
and
so
is
the
sour
and
the
oak
adds
a
lot
more
than
usual
i
mean
this
is
really
oak
dominated
woody
in
taste
semisweet
and
clean
finishing
not
nearly
as
sour
as
it
is
funky
more
of
a
must
than
a
funk
really
old
and
dank
mature
might
be
the
right
word
its
just
not
coming
at
me
in
waves
and
it
almost
seems
like
a
simple
beer
lacking
the
complexity
of
others
maybe
in
a
good
way
maybe
not
either
way
it
tastes
almost
familiar
and
if
this
is
the
standard
by
which
the
style
is
measured
there
are
a
lot
of
good
copy
cats
out
there
still
i
love
the
yeast
and
i
love
the
softer
feel
to
this
just
a
tickle
of
carbonation
and
a
very
easy
drinking
medium
body
fun
and
special
beer
but
not
a
drink
of
the
gods
as
some
say
just
great
gueuze
overall
very
happy
with
this
choice
as
the
official
start
to
christmas
a
fine
gueuze
thanks
again
and
a
very
merry
christmas
chris
very
interesting
take
on
the
geuze
style
i
dont
think
this
is
supposed
to
be
a
classical
geuze
style
but
rather
more
of
a
blend
of
2year
old
lambics
it
shows
here
more
complex
but
less
effervescent
and
refreshing
than
classic
geuze
worth
trying
at
least
once
but
i
would
suggest
that
your
resources
are
better
off
going
towards
the
lou
pepe
kriek
or
framboise
750ml

from

basket
it
pours
a
hazy

with
a

dwindling
down

from
the

aroma
is
massive

very

dominant
as

is

bitter
white
grapefruit
and
pomelo
come
in
to
balance
the
sourness
but
there
is
just
nowhere
near
the
balance
and
freshness
i
get
from
2005
iris
or
russian
river
beatification
palate
is
uber
mouth
watering
so
lactic
sour
that
it
is
near
lacerative
i
had
to
drink
most
of
the
bottle
myself
unfortunately
but
in
small
quantities
the
palate
is
fresh
fruity
and
soft
really
so
beautiful
bound
to
age
extremely
well
o
a
real
find
in
terms
of
drinkability
reading
the
website
after
confrims
the
idea
of
subtle
in
this
style
and
it
works
a
treat
overall
im
a
huge
cantillon
fan
and
their
regular
gueuze
is
one
of
my
favorites
so
i
had
very
high
expectations
coming
into
this
with
that
being
said
i
was
definitely
disappointed
in
this
one
its
a
good
gueuze
for
sure
but
doesnt
live
up
to
its
hype
or
up
to
the
standard
of
other
cantillon
beers
pale
and
very
clear
gueuze
tumbler
definitely
a
bigger
layer
of
flavor
and
more
sour
finish
than
the
standard
gueuze
barnyard
funk
hay
citrus
zest
a
touch
acidic
white
grape
skin
brett
liked
this
very
much
it
was
rainin
lou
pepes
in
brussels
good
funk
on
the
nose
and
a
nice
lactic
sourness
with
moderate
levels
of
funk
on
the
palate
ill
be
honest
i
expected
more
out
of
this
bottle
it
has
nice
characteristics
but
nothing
i
havent
gotten
out
of
a
regular
bottle
of
aged
cantillon
geueuze
the
flavor
may
have
been
a
little
better
in
some
of
those
tbh
although
it
is
a
good
beer
i
just
wanted
this
to
be
a
touch
better
this
is
such
an
offputting
beer
to
the
uninitiated
ive
had
many
beers
of
this
style
that
i
like
so
im
happy
to
sit
here
drink
and
enjoy
but
the
fact
is
theres
nothing
special
to
really
recommend
this
so
i
almost
feel
like
the
sourness
has
an
arrogance
to
it
like
if
people
dont
like
this
then
theyre
wrong
and
fuck
them
whereas
there
should
be
more
offered
for
lay
people
to
enjoy
rather
than
just
pure
off
funky
acidity
slightly
hazy
aromas
of
hay
mild
lemon
and
a
touch
of
sulfur
lightly
sweet
with
moderate
tartness
and
lot
of
minerality
medium
carbonation
and
mediumlight
body
this
has
been
a
longterm
want
and
im
glad
to
have
finally
gotten
to
try
it
but
overall
it
was
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
and
didnt
stand
up
to
most
of
the
rest
of
the
cantillon
lineup
in
my
opinion
o
another
excellent
gueuze
from
cantillon
im
really
not
sure
if
i
prefer
this
or
their
classic
gueuze
its
pretty
close
very
tasty
highly
drinkable
and
all
around
a
great
beer

to

thanks
again

i

surprisingly
and
utterly
clear
champagnelike
bubbles
rose
to
a
small
foamy
white
head
that
receded
to
a
thin
layer
within
a
few
seconds
no
real
lacing
to
speak
of
aroma
was
fairly
mild
notes
of
funk
horseblanket
and
minor
touches
of

the

again
minor
acidic

but
nothing
too
tart
or
overbearing
lightmedium
body
and
decently
drinkable
i
just
really
dont
like
the
oakwood
quality
in
this
beer
i
think
it
clashes
with
the
other
flavors
too
much
after
having
the
classic
gueuze
first
i
definitely
liked
this
one
better
than
that
ive
had
the
classic
before
but
it
was
nice
to
be
able
to
compare
these
two
back
to
back
this
is
medium
bodied
with
a
modest
amount
of
lively
carbonation
it
is
complex
refreshing
and
easy
drinking
with
seemingly
no
alcohol
impact
i
am
going
to
venture
a
guess
and
say
this
is
about
the
4th
or
5th
time
i
have
had
lou
pepe
geuze
between
the
05
and
08
vintage
i
shit
you
not
this
beer
tastes
wildly
different
with
every
experience
this
is
perhaps
the
most
fruited
and
zesty
iteration
of
any
cantillon
i
have
had
i
hope
my
other
bottles
are
like
this
o
top
five
beers
i
have
ever
had
o
overall
impressivegueze
would
love
to
try
it
fresher
to
see
what
the
4
years
did
to
it
but
really
nice
mellow
and
balanced
gueze
until
today
id
only
had
classic
gueuze
and
this
completely
blows
it
away
awesome
aroma
with
much
more
complexity
and
depth
of
flavor
than
the
regular
gueuze
stronger
puckering
sourness
too
all
in
all
a
much
more
mature
lambic
in
more
ways
than
one
that
i
wish
was
more
easily
available
overall
excellent
a
very
nice
beer
no
problem
finishing
this
bottle
solo
a
massive
thanks
goes
out
to
cmrillo
for
bringing
this
one
out
during
his
own

beers
40

vintage
served
from
bottle
into
a
cantillon
taster
flute
poured
a
golden
yellow
with
a
half
finger
white
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
quickly
maintained
decent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
lemon
rine
lemon
zest
funk
sour
and
tart
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
lemon
rine
funk
citrus
sour
and
tart
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
high
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
great
brew
the
lou
pepe
treatment
really
added
a
nice
touch
to
this
brew
there
was
a
nice
citruslemon
aspect
going
on
in
this
one
in
both
the
aroma
and
flavor
this
made
it
really
easy
to
drink
and
balanced
out
the
sour
and
tart
characters
going
on
definitely
worth
trying
if
you
have
not
done
so
recommend
cantillon
lou
pepe
gueuze
is
one
of
the
best
spontaneously
fermented
beers
to
have
ever
passed
my
lips
although
it
may
not
be
super
complex
it
is
immensely
flavorful
and
astonishingly
drinkable
i
wish
i
had
purchased
more
of
these
when
i
had
the
chance
to
do
so
a
definitive
version
of
the
style
a
classic
just
about
perfect
really
gorgeous
beer
in
fact
very
near
sublime
its
so
smooth
and
yet
with
all
the
refined
haughtiness
of
the
best
gueuzes
i
love
that
the
acidity
is
so
restrained
it
makes
for
a
less
raw
and
powerful
but
more
sophisticated
brew
really
the
skill
that
has
gone
into
its
preparation
is
astonishing
o
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
gueuze
and
an
improvement
on
the
classic
gueuze
which
is
one
of
my
all
time
favorites
another
winner
in
the
lou
pepe
series
i
think
i
would
rank
this
very
slightly
behind
the
lp
kriek
and
in
front
of
the
lp
framboise
super
funky
and
cheesey
would
love
to
get
some
bottles
of
this
one
pours
a
murky
honey
yellow
with
an
offwhite
head
that
fades
to
nothing
no
lacing
on
this
one
smell
is
just
all
over
the
place
with
sour
funk
tart
and
barnyard
aromas
taste
is
exactly
the
same
as
the
smell
with
an
acidic
bite
to
it
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
very
good
gueuze
with
some
extreme
aromas
and
flavors

nice
last
beer
to
end
my
short
trip
to
belgium
o
fantastic
beer
very
interesting
and
very
enjoyable
very
complex
flavor
that
im
sure
i
didnt
do
justice
in
this
review
meh
over
priced
gueuze
thats
nothing
special
for
at
least
5
years
who
has
the
time
and
money
for
that
light
to
medium
bodied
with
good
carbonation
taste
and
feel
is
a
bit
thin
in
the
middle
but
overall
is
quite
typical
of
a
gueuze
o
this
beer
is
superb
i
have
yet
to
be
let
down
by
cantillon
really
nice
well
balanced
easy
drinking
with
a
perfect
amount
of
sourness
and
funk
i
could
drink
this
all
day
overall
this
was
a
lot
like
classic
very
drinkable
and
very
flavorful
amazing
beer
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
o
wow
very
nice
now
i
see
what
the
fuss
is
about
the
tart
sourness
of
this
beer
is
upfront
all
the
way
through
but
just
behind
it
is
a
complex
barny
horsey
funkyness
that
seems
to
evolve
with
every
sip
lastly
i
dont
understand
why
this
is
classified
as
a
gueuze
as
it
is
only
two
year
old
lambic
no
blending
golden
amber
hue
with
a
rather
small
amount
of
off
white
head
surprisingly
modest
lactic
sour
more
funk
than
sour
the
mold
and
wet
wood
are
very
prominent
wet
straw
and
lemons
flavors
are
much
more
sour
the
lactic
is
bitingly
tart
with
plenty
of
moldy
wood
and
dirty
basement
a
touch
of
black
pepper
in
the
finish
lightish
body
with
mild
carbonation
overall
a
great
gueuze
although
i
was
hoping
for
a
tongue
ripping
sour
this
is
the
2008
vintage
and
yeah
i
know
its
a
little
early
to
be
cracking
it
but
after
today
i
thought
i
deserve
it
plus
i
always
like
comparing
beers
when
fresh
compared
to
aged
and
it
pours
a
hazy
apricot
hue
which
leaves
a
wispy
one
finger
head
that
doesnt
stay
long
and
not
much
lacing
eitherthe
smell
is
parmesan
cheesewhite
grapesvinegar
and
wet

mouthfeel
is
medium

and
bone
dry
and
has
nice
tastes
of
sav
blanc
grapeslemon
zesta
touch
of
tangerines
and
finished
with
a
funky
sour
dryness
that
makes
you
want
another
sip
straight
away
and
overal
without
doubt
this
has
to
be
one
of
the
top
versions
of
this
style
fresh
or
aged
as
this
brew
will
definately
hold
for
the
20years
it
says
it
will
on
the
back
label
and
thoroughly
recommend
you
try
cheers
o
other
than
the
armand
lente
this
was
my
favorite
beer
of
the
day
the
balance
of
funk
and
fruit
was
spot
on
and
i
had
no
problem
putting
back
my
half
a
bottle
worth
every
penny
fun
to
try
nonetheless
good
but
not
as
complex
as
i
was
expecting
not
sure
if
maybe
its
this
vintage
or
what
was
looking
for
a
bit
more
depth
but
regardless
would
buy
again
i
kind
of
think
the
classic
gueuze
might
be
a
bit
better
overall
mouthfeeloverall
body
is
light
with
moderate
carbonation
very
light
and
refreshing
overall
a
very
good
gueuze
would
have
liked
to
see
it
a
touch
more
sour
as
it
was
more
balanced
between
the
unripe
fruits
vs
funk
and
lactic
sourness
though
i
hate
to
say
it
i
almost
wished
for
more
heartburning
acidity
from
this
bottle
the
tart
enamelmelting
funk
i
hoped
for
never
quite
came
through
and
though
this
is
still
a
fine
gueuze
i
expected
more
overall
a
tasty
treat
but
sadly
not
as
good
as
its
easier
to
find
brothers
framboise
and
kriek
overall
the
age
on
this
beer
has
clearly
added
to
the
robustness
of
the
flavor
unfortunately
the
flavor
is
a
little
lighter
than
i
would
want
from
a
gueuze
overall
this
was
so
smooth
my
wife
enjoyed
it
and
she
hates
sour
beer
just
awesome
o
best
geuze
that
i
have
had
to
date
the
balance
between
the
flavours
is
just
magic
and
i
could
drink
it
all
day
long
interesting
stuff
and
i
understand
why
this
beers
so
sought
after
at
25
a
bottle
that
says
something
im
having
a
good
time
learning
about
funky
stuff
cant
wait
until
i
can
afford
some
more
to
see
how
it
ages
this
is
a
great
beer
again
the
balance
is
just
perfect
often
times
i
like
the
tarter
gueuzes
but
with
a
meal
or
taking
down
a
75
solo
this
geueze
is
perfect
750ml

to

a
hazy
gold
with
little
head
aromas
of
funky
horse
blanket
and
straw
loads
of
lemon
zest
and
mellowed
vinegar
flavor
is
a
nice
balance
of
citrus
and
funk
with
leather
and
earthy
notes
not
a
super
sour
beer
but
rather
a
nice
gueuze
overall
and
a
perfect
summer
brew
flavors
last
long
on
the
finish
and
end
refreshingly
nice
well
done
this
beer
pours
a
bit
darker
than
most
gueuzes
i
have
had
it
is
a
reddish
color
no
doubt
from
the
wine
barrels
it
was
aged
in
the
smell
is
acetic
funky
and
definite
red
wine
notes
the
flavor
is
sour
again
nice
flavors
from
the
red
wine
barrels
and
a
decent
amount
of
funk
the
mouthfeel
is
light
puckering
and
well
carbonated
a
truly
excellent
example
of
a
gueuze
m
light
oily
and
smooth
in
the
mouth
but
light
carbonation
detracts
a
bit
from
the
experience
for
me
grandfather
gueuze
looks
the
part
with
a
deep
gold
color
with
some
bronze
and
orange
highlights
towards
the
sides
a
nice
cap
of
bright
white
foam
that
leaves
some
small
streaks
on
the
glass
that
glide
down
not
fully
sticking
whoa
the
musk
on
this
one
is
undeniably
old
gueuze
big
scents
of
oak
from
the
longer
time
in
the
barrels
wood
lemon
zest
hay
barnyard
funk
and
sour
bugs
its
really
bold
and
thats
what
counts
taste
is
off
the
charts
a
deep
sour
that
is
large
yet
not
tounge
reducing
swishing
this
around
the
mouth
really
does
wonders
tastes
of
old
wet
woodoak
with
a
blast
of
earthy
tastes
from
the
barn
including
hay
citrus
is
on
the
lemon
side
with
trace
orange
malted
barley
makes
a
appearence
at
times
but
dont
look
for
it
to
save
you
from
the
sour
attack
that
grandpappy
is
feel
is
light
bodied
like
most
gueuze
highly
carbonated
fizzy
and
a
bit
scorching
on
the
tounge
after
a
few
sips
puckering
is
a
understatement
a
bit
acetic
on
the
end
this
one
is
a
shocker
and
i
only
wish
i
could
find
some
bottles
to
lay
down
but
that
aint
happening
anytime
soon
d
great
soft
and
subtle
with
nice
tartness
and
good
body
pours
a
very
murky
hazy
yellowish
almost
no
head
pours
fairly
thick
smells
funky
and
floral
tastes
fruity
peachy
and
floral
sme
nice

funk
thick
on
the

the

carbonated
mouthfeel
is

so
much

very

excellent
beer
d
i
like
this
gueuze
it
has
a
happy
marriage
of
dry
earthy
funk
and
a
mellow
fruity
acidity
the
beauty
of
this
one
really
is
in
its
balance
complex
profile
and
restrained
potency
this
is
a
great
drinking
gueuze
that
would
be
great
to
have
around
to
have
with
meals
and
perhaps
a
snack
of
artisan
cheeses
lambics
are
a
very
interesting
style
of
beer
not
something
i
drink
on
a
regular
basis
but
something
i
enjoy
when
i
want
something
radically
different
dry
light
and
easy
to
drink
despite
the
strong
acidic
sourness
this
tasting
has
proven
to
be
quite
a
case
study
in
the
peculiarities
and
spontaneity
of
natural
fermentation
this
is
far
different
from
the
other
great
lambics
of
the
tasting
and
it
still
manages
to
hold
its
own
the
more
still
mouthfeel
and
resulting
body
really
does
help
this
beer
out
another
great
offering
from
cantillon
i
do
like
the
sour
but
not
just
for
the
mere
sake
of
it
that
said
this
has
it
in
spades
but
with
the
caveat
of
a
nicely
supportive
dose
of
malt
fruit
and
yeast
which
are
deftly
balanced
when
taken
as
a
whole
generally
dry
and
somewhat
acerbic
sure
but
genuinely
tasty
all
on
its
own
or
i
imagine
with
some
appropriate
food
pommes
frites
anyone
a
light
body
with
low
carbonation
very
well
melded
creating
a
sum
is
greater
than
the
partseffect
less
sour
but
more
subdued
and
mellow
than
i
expected
an
awesome
gueuse
opens
up
as
it
warms
i
could
drink
this
all
night
a
great
last
beer
of
the
night
nothing
can
top
this
d
what
is
surprising
about
this
beer
is
the
stark
contrast
between
the
2000
and
2001
vintages
2001
was
in
my
opinion
far
and
away
a
superior
beer
with
more
funk
more
tartness
and
simply
more
character
still
regardless
of
the
vintage
seek
this
one
out
and
sit
on
it
a
gem
of
a
beer
highly
recommended
if
you
can
get
your
hands
on
it
this
is
one
of
those
beers
definitey
trying
at
least
once
and
even
more
than
that
if
you
can
afford
it
an
incredible
example
of
craftsmanship
when
it
comes
to
blending
lambics
poured

nice
bretty
funky
oaky
barrel
accents
the
brew
was
medium
in
body
with
a
low
amount
of
carbonation
which
had
a
citrusy
oaky
barnyard
funky
sour
and
mild
dry
finish
that
lingered
on
the
taste
buds
it
iis
really
one
of
the
best
gueuzes
from
cantillon
and
one
of
the
best
overall
that
ive
try
so
far
it
was
really
tasty
and
drank
pretty
good
if
this
wasnt
so
much
i
would
drink
it
every
day
for
the
rest
of
my
life
it
was
really
quite
a
treat
to
drink
i
enjoyed
every
sip
this
2007
vintage
is
drinking
excellently
and
is
worth
every
cent
cantillon
excels
at
producing
highly
drinkable
lambics
of
outstanding
quality
abd
this
is
no
different
real
nice
horsey
funk
with
a
bit
of
gym
socks
thrown
in
light
citrus
oranges
and
lemon
hint
of
apple
woody
and
earthy
hint
of
straw
light
vinous
quality
a
bit
of
a
heftier
malt
bill
than
many
geuzes
gives
it
a
softer
mouthfeel
a
bit
chewier
balanced
acidity
unlike
some
of
the
other
lou
pepe
series

with

the

the

simultaneously
with

with

would

lets
you

you
are
sipping
something
fine
and
should
not
overindulge
as
does
the
vinergary
burn
in
the
back
of
your
throat
i
will
have
trouble
finishing
this
750
alone
but
will
feel
blessed
to
have
done
so
so
good
d
extremely
drinkable
it
would
be
quite
easy
to
throw
back
several
glasses
pours
a
slightly
hazed
straw
color
with
a
white
head
and
bits
of
lacing
nose
brigs
forward
a
moderate
amount
of
funk
thogh
not
what
i
generally
expect
from
cantillon
there
does
seem
to
be
a
lot
going
on
with
some
hay
leather
and
a
bit
of
citrus
zest
the
taste
doesnt
quite
live
up
as
this
is
not
nearly
as
multidimensional
as
what
you
typically
get
from
cantillon
feel
is
nice
and
integrated
drinks
well
but
not
as
special
as
i
had
hoped
beer
is
thin
and
moderately
carbonated
in
the
mouth
its
mildly
acidic
mildly
citric
and
lactic
is
the
winner
here
this
is
some
oakiness
and
funk
to
it
its
not
as
good
as
the
classic
gueuze
which
i
suppose
i
should
be
happy
about
since
this
beer
is
more
expensive
and
harder
to
get
but
i
was
just
expecting
more
the
comparison
of
the
lou
pepe
kriek
and
the
100
kriek
lambic
is
nearly
universally
agreed
that
the
lou
pepe
is
much
much
better
this
beer
in
my
opinion
does
not
improve
from
the
base
still
its
a
good
gueuze
and
another
good
beer
from
cantillon
2001
bottle
cork
comes
out
without
a
pop
little
fragment
left
strewn
about
pours
a
clear
gold
with
a
thin
head
that
recedes
to
naught
very
sour
lemony
nose
especially
after
the
old
drie
fonteinen
and
de
cam
offerings
we
devoured
previously
pungent
sour
flavor
very
musty
and
funky
maybe
a
touch
of
white
wine
vinegar
this
is
quite
dry
and
intense
reminded
me
a
bit
of
cantillon
lh12
but
blended
with
their
standard
gueuze
had
a
lot
of
that
earthy
pungent
bite
to
it
at
this
age
dgood
balance
of
acidity
the
funk
is
there
but
it
fades
a
little
in
the
taste
the
citrus
profile
is
nice
and
the
tartness
is
moderate
and
enjoyable
a
singular
gueuze
one
of
the
greats
d
like
the
other
lou
pepe
beers
this
one
is
really
easy
to
drink
not
insanely
sour
but
well
balanced
and
nice
to
sit
down
and
drink
d
quite
the
gueuze
even
more
age
should
treat
this
beer
favorably
cant
wait
to
crack
my
2000
vintage
not
the
most
complex
gueuze
ive
had
but
still
impressive
bold
flavors
challenging
in
a
good
way
not
too
strong
abvwise
which
is
always
a
plus
not
one
you
could
drink
one
after
the
other

pretty
rewarding

another

i
was
expecting
notes
2007
gueuze
bottle
on
12
october
2009
this
is
a
fairly
mellow
sour
with
the
flavors
much
more
in
an
equal
balance
with
the
fruitiness
this
still
is
a
sour
beer
no
question
good
easy
to
drink
sour
that
has
a
good
mix
of
flavors
and
wont
kill
your
palate
or
overload
you
with
tartsouracidic
flavors
definitely
worth
a
try
great
mouthfeel
with
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
as
always
amazingly
unique
and
interesting
mouthfeel
is
light
and
airy
and
it
is
very
refreshing
making
the
drinkability
great
d
this
was
really
easydrinking
if
it
werent
so
expensive
id
have
it
more
often
fairly
balanced
in
the
flavor
dimensions
associated
with
gueuze
sour
sweet
funky
and
tart
not
sure
if
i
prefer
to
classic
gueuze
but
its
on
the
same
level
for
sure
notes
to
enjoy
this
beer
is
to
experience
a
true
lambic
from
the
worlds
foremost
producer
of
the
style
feel
and
drinkability
the
beer
finishes
bone
dry
like
im
parched
in
the
desert
oakiness
really
compliments
the
dryness
as
does
the
tartness
which
leads
to
dryness
then
gives
way
to
massive
oak
character
and
an
unparalleled
dry
quality
this
is
one
unique
beer
and
ill
happily
finish
it
im
definitely
going
to
enjoy
the
rest
of
this
one
however
its
a
bit
pricey
or
well
just
plain
expensive
at
about
24
for
this
750
ive
really
got
to
be
in
the
mood
for
this
type
of
beer
this
isnt
just
an
anytime
beer
itd
take
a
certain
mood
for
me
to
go
after
this
again
definitely
worth
a
try
and
an
awesome
experience
dont
pass
it
up
itll
broaden
your
horizons
its
done
so
for
me
drinkability
drank
the
entire
bottle
myself
and
when
it
was
finished
i
wished
i
had
another
bottle
d
extremely
pungent
and
tart
with
enough
barnyard
notes
to
make
even
the
cows
perk
up
and
take
notice
this
is
definitely
over
the
top
but
still
retains
some
semblance
of
drinkability
in
the
process
d
complex
and
drinkable
this
is
a
classic
gueuze
the
funk
is
complex
and
the
sourness
is
substantial
but
smooth
enough
that
it
doesnt
crush
the
palate
the
malt
character
is
noticeable
and
there
are
some
complex
spicy
notes
that
make
this
stand
out
from
other
examples
of
the
style
the
aroma
in
particular
is
very
nice
with
a
complex
blend
of
musty
acids
that
keep
me
raising
the
glass
to
my
nose
between
sips
just
to
enjoy
the
smell
again
this
is
a
very
expensive
beer
but
if
any
beer
can
live
up
to
this
kind
of
price
tag
this
one
does
750ml
bottle
corked
and
capped
2006
vintage
with
2008
printed
on
the
cork
the
beer
is
light
copper
orange
color
with
just
a
thin
layer
of
foam
clear
on
the
first
few
pours
but
becoming
cloudier
in
the
later
ones
the
aroma
is
unbelievable
horseblanket
funk
and
mustiness
the
nose
has
the
promise
of
strong
sour
tartness
the
taste
comes
through
with
all
these
flavors
but
isnt
puckeringly
sour
i
can
taste
some
light
citrus
flavors
maybe
lemon
or
something
similar
i
dont
get
much
from
the
oak
barrels
maybe
the
wild
yeast
just
dominate
the
beer
too
much
for
these
nuances
to
come
through
overwhelmingly
good
this
is
top
shelf
with
no
flaws
that
i
can
find
it
might
seem
expensive
24
in
columbus
but
really
its
a
good
value
if
you
compare
it
with
wild
ales
from
russian
river
or
lost
abbey
high
marks
on
drinkability
pulls
you
back
for
more
so
many
cool
things
going
on
makes
it
both
interesting
and
enjoyable
overall
i
had
very
high
hopes
but
i
was
pretty
disappointed
its
good
not
elite
you
can
probably
find
something
more
comparable
for
half
the
price
the
funk
in
the
flavor
is
a
bit
more
restrained
its
lemon
with
earthiness
low
lactic
sourness
and
a
moderate
tannic
quality
brett
provides
mustiness
and
subtle
barnyard
notes
the
finish
is
tart
lemon
peel
with
a
drying
tannic
quality
and
a
low
level
of
acetic
character
overall
the
flavor
is
soft
and
well
rounded
sheer
quality
from
cantillon
overall
this
is
yet
another
winner
from
cantillon
and
lou
pepe
a
refreshing
and
tasty
queuze
that
totally
defines
the
style
i
am
excited
to
see
how
my
other
bottles
do
in
a
decade
or
so
a
fine
beer
d
i
think
with
this
beer
i
finally
understood
and
appreciated
cantillon
d
i
could
have
drank
the
entire
bottle
myself
and
was
sad
when
it
was
over
drinkability
i
must
say
this
is
my
least
favorite
of
the
lou
pepe
series
a
great
sour
that
isnt
all
about
the
sour
d
very
good
a
complex
and
very
funky
gueuze
not
very
acidic
considering
the
brewery
behind
it
its
actually
almost
too
easy
to
drink
it
seems
like
it
looses
character
after
a
while
as
if
the
acidity
mellows
out
what
a
great
beer
and
with
this
much
age
on
it
it
is
just
divine
d
better
than
the
regular
cantillon
gueuze
cant
pinpoint
why
exactly
maybe
its
a
little
better
balanced
and
smoother
glad
i
finally
tried
this
one
great
geuze
theres
a
lot
more
going
on
than
just
sour
and
funk
which
i
like
expensive
but
definitely
worth
the
price
every
now
and
again
overall
another
classic
cantillon
very
fortunate
to
have
a
steady
supply
of
these
beers
especially
considering
i
dont
have
access
to
rr
and
la
probably
the
most
drinkable
gueuze
ive
ever
had
since
it
is
so
smooth
and
light
personally
i
prefer
a
tart
bomb
but
im
impressed
with
the
delicacy
that
they
achieved
with
this
one
bottle
poured
a
dark
golden
orange
color
lambic
with
a
quite
large
bubbly
head
with
good
retention
and
some
lacing
aroma
consists
of
sour
notes
with
some
distinctive
oak
and
not
much
acidity
which
kind
of
surprised
me
taste
was
very
refreshing
with
some
sour
notes
and
some
oak
i
was
expecting
more
acidity
and
some
barnyard
notes
but
those
were
almost
completely
absent
well
done
but
considering
the
price
difference
i
would
stick
with
the
regular
gueuze
really
an
exceptional
gueuze
complex
and
fantastically
flavorful
but
at
the
same
time
very
drinkable
and
not
overwhelming
or
harsh
in
any
way
really
what
ever
beer
should
try
to
be
wow
as
i
am
progressing
through
this
bottle
i
am
really
starting
to
like
this
beer
a
lot
stands
out
from
any
other
gueuze
ive
tried
will
definitely
seek
this
out
again
despite
its
cost
im
really
enjoying
this
and
the
sourness
is
well
balanced

had
a
bottle
from

the

was

a

the

is
interesting
in
that
it
has

a
lemony

without
the

this
is
a
standout
beer
fucking
fantastic
this
was
shared
with
atlbeerdog
and
pullen
thanks
dan
for
sharing
this
one
with
us
taste
mouthfeel
lemony
and
tart
but
surprisingly
soft
on
the
acidity
flavors
of
green
apple
skin
cider
vinegar
dry
white
wine
and
even
a
touch
of
tannic
red
wine
presumably
from
the
barrel
complex
and
well
balanced
a
definite
sipper
but
very
easy
to
drink
gentle
carbonation
enough
to
give
it
a
bubbly
mouthfeel
but
not
much
more
delicious
stuff
one
of
the
best
around
d
i
was
hesitant
to
buy
750ml
of
a
beer
that
i
was
sure
would
give
me
acid
reflux
i
love
em
but
they
are
painful
this
was
far
from
mild
but
it
was
tame
enough
that
i
could
have
easily
tackled
the
whole
bottle
myself
i
am
glad
that
i
shared
this
one
though
definitely
recommended
as
a
gateway
into
sour
beer
flavor
is
similar
to
the
aroma
with
a
bit
more
sourness
coming
through
its
definitely
not
heavy
on
the
vinegar
which
i
liked
and
the
dryness
is
manageable
citrus
notes
of
orange
peel
and
oak
linger
on
the
finish
body
is
crisp
surprisingly
refreshing
and
light
overall
a
fantastic
brew
but
im
glad
my
friend
footed
the
hefty
price
tag
for
this
one
25
99
d
i
find
this
fairly
drinkable
overall
and
quite
drinkable
for
the
style
im
still
trying
to
get
used
to
the
style
to
some
extent
as
i
dont
have
many
opportunities
to
try
sours
but
i
can
certainly
recognize
that
this
a
great
beer
in
this
style
overall
while
not
my
favorite
sour
i
have
ever
had
it
is
up
there
this
is
about
as
solid
as
they
come
and
priced
right
along
with
the
upper
echelon
of
beers
i
would
have
no
issue
trying
this
again
and
to
be
honest
would
be
curious
to
see
how
it
holds
up
in
the
even
earlier
vintages
this
was
a
birthday
present
so
ill
be
savoring
the
750
all
to
myself
d
if
youre
accustomed
to
sour
offerings
its
easy
to
drink
otherwise
you
may
want
to
stick
to
that
bottle
of
champagne
in
the
back
of
your
refrigerator
instead
great
session
brew
if
i
could
get
this
all
the
time
great
this
2000
vintage
beer
came
in
a
corked
bottle
with
a
crown
cap
covering
it
and
it
was
a
good
thing
too
as
the
cork
appeared
to
have
dried
up
and
shrunk
in
upright
storage
the
cap
had
done
its
job
and
the
beer
was
effervescent
clear
and
champagne
like
the
smell
was
very
mature
and
ripe
and
the
aging
seemed
to
have
taken
a
lot
of
the
funky
edges
off
the
smell
reminded
me
of
fresh
squeezed
lemon
juice
or
a
cider
made
from
green
apples
taste
was
very
dry
and
sour
with
no
hint
of
any
sweetness
that
might
have
ever
been
present
a
little
bit
of
hay
and
cheddar
were
apparent
in
the
taste
as
well
despite
all
this
acidity
and
complexity
it
was
smooth
and
refreshing
and
not
harsh
at
all
airy
and
slippery
with
a
high
level
of
puckering
feel
easy
to
drink
except
for
the
steep
price
of
admission
i
can
take
a
geuze
some
are
sweeter
some
more
mellow
i
was
expecting
the
mellow
with
complexity
based
on
what
i
heard
based
on
the
rating
what
i
got
and
important
this
was
a
2000
vintage
was
an
absolutely
sour
geuze
with
some
edge
taken
off
its
lemony
with
some
ginger
from
fruit
peaks
out
but
its
sour
and
while
i
finished
23
of
a
litre
i
could
not
tolerate
the
entire
bomber
perhaps
i
did
not
get
off
to
a
great
start
with
mold
on
top
of
the
cap
and
into
the
initial
aroma
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
tart
effervescent
and
lightly
sour
on
the
finish
md
by
cantillons
standard
this
one
is
not
sour
or
harsh
at
all
this
is
an
ultrasmooth
fragrant
and
mature
gauze
to
savour
but
i
wonder
how
it
has
gained
so
much
oaky
influence
even
after
so
many
years
of
aging
in
the
bottle
its
my
cup
of
tea
anyway
fellow
ba
greencard
once
mentioned
that
this
is
his
alltime
favourite
geuze
now
i
can
understand
why
this
is
a
review
of
the
2000
lou
pepe
gueze
which
i
had
a
few
days
ago
this
bottle
looked
fine
from
the
outside
but
under
the
foil
was
the
scariest
cap
i
have
ever
seen
completely
rusted
through
it
showered
by
counter
with
black
and
rustred
metallic
dust
and
debris
when
i
popped
the
cap
and
just
crumbled
completeely
the
cork
underneath
was
a
grayish
black
i
feared
the
worst
but
decided
to
clean
the
top
and
carefully
pull
the
cork
luckily
it
was
only
the
top
of
the
cork
that
was
discolored
the
remaining
45ths
of
the
cork
was
perfectly
fine
and
sealed
the
beer
very
well
there
was
a
popping
sound
when
i
uncorked
the
beer
and
some
not
excessive
foam
the
beer
was
fine
it
poured
a
nice
somewhat
cloudy
dark
golden
into
a
chalice
with
a
surprisingly
good
head
for
its
age
that
settled
to
a
ring
and
stuck
around
for
the
duration
of
the
beer
just
okay
lacing
the
smell
was
a
little
faint
by
now
but
exhibited
typical
barnyard
aromas
a
whiff
of
lemon
and
a
hint
of
brie
cheese
there
was
also
an
underlying
acidic
apple
smell
sorta
like
a
scrumpy
not
acetic
but
mild
and
pleasant
the
flavors
were
just
wonderful
perfectly
balanced
tartness
not
acetic
barnyard
flavors
perfectly
ripe
cheese
a
touch
of
wood
everything
was
seamlessly
integrated
and
oh
so
smooth
and
subtle
this
beer
has
been
considerably
mellowed
by
aging
not
in
your
face
at
all
extremely
enjoyable
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
crisp
and
refreshing
i
could
drink
this
all
day
wonderful
to
see
that
its
still
holding
up
the
cork
is
dated
2004
so
im
guessing
they
aged
this
at
the
brewery
clear
pale
peach
respectable
collar
of
tight
white
foamage
incredibly
fine
bubbled
actually
laces
on
the
glass
pretty
well
which
i
find
unusual
for
a
lambic
nice
and
funky
aroma
pungent
crabapple
stilton
and
aged
swiss
cheese
and
bottomofthehaybale
funkiness
very
acidic
with
a
citrus
tint
the
flavor
opens
with
softened
silky
carbonation
really
really
nice
the
beer
just
glides
along
on
microscopic
bubbles
almost
immediately
tart
with
little
to
no
sweetness
mostly
a
cheesy
kind
of
funk
with
heaps
of
lemon
juice
and
wild
crabapple
definite
bleu
cheese
going
on
here
moldy
and
dank
just
about
everything
including
the
kitchen
sink
going
on
in
here
almost
gamey
at
times
then
a
bit
of
sweetness
can
be
detected
lots
going
on
here
so
dry
it
could
be
called
arid
stripping
my
palate
of
any
and
all
moisture
very
sharp
though
in
a
more
refined
way
than
the
regular
cantillon
gueuze
nicely
aged
with
a
very
elegant
urbane
feel
if
you
believe
any
wine
can
compete
with
this
kind
of
complexity
ive
got
a
bridge
ill
sell
to
you
for
a
real
bargain
as
an
acolyte
in
this
style
my
impressions
are
based
upon
nothing
other
than
what
ive
read
expectations
based
upon
nothing
and
impressions
of
flavors
with
all
that
im
enjoying
this
drink
its
not
overwhelming
me
in
any
manner
but
it
does
leave
me
wanting
for
a
taste
of
something
to
nibble
on
to
contrast
or
maybe
complement
the
flavors
as
they
are
striking
enough
to
warrant
a
distraction
nicely
drinkable
as
i
had
little
difficulty
finishing
off
the
bottle
notes
disclaimer
im
a
huge
gueze
fan
this
is
up
there
with
the
finest
ive
had
blending
in
older
lambics
is
the
greatest
invention
ever
you
might
say
what
about
internet
mass
production
the
wheel
nope
its
blending
lambics
yummmm
overall
very
nice
i
havent
had
a
bad
cantillon
beer
very
clean
mouthfeel
not
filmy
very
refreshing
lightbodied
but
not
watery
very
drinkable
easy
to
drink
and
the
simple
tastes
involved
are
actually
to
its
advantage
mouthfeel
drinkability
the
beer
is
light
bodied
the
beer
has
ample
carbonation
this
is
the
least
harsh
of
any
cantillon
product
i
have
drank
this
beer
is
oddly
refreshing
and
made
me
wish
for
more
not
my
favorite
geuze
its
not
big
enough
ballsy
enough
nor
sour
enough
still
i
feel
lucky
to
have
tried
it
the
sticker
on
the
bottle
says
2002
the
cork
is
too
mangled
to
really
tell
what
that
last
number
is
hmmm
the
first
thing
i
notice
about
this
beer
as
opposed
to
cantillons
flagship
gueuze
is
less
carbonation
pours
a
bright
vibrant
orange
with
no
head
to
speak
off
but
little
gatherings
of
bubbles
smells
rather
typical
for
cantillon
all
the
usual
suspects
are
there
big
and
funky
lots
of
brett
out
front
here
citrusy
zesty
dusty
taste
is
more
subdued
than
much
of
the
cantillon
line
which
i
like
definitely
tart
and
sour
plenty
of
granny
smith
apple
and
lemon
rind
but
its
mellowed
a
bit
here
id
really
like
try
one
thats
even
older
and
more
curmudgeony
you
cant
really
taste
much
sweetness
but
i
can
pick
up
on
the
difference
between
this
beer
and
their
normal
gueuze
which
has
a
younger
lambic
in
the
blend
this
one
is
much
softer
in
a
word
theres
something
to
be
said
for
the
younger
and
wilder
punch
that
the
regular
gueze
has
but
this
one
allows
for
more
complex
tastes
to
shine
through
lots
of
must
dust
and
mold
almost
as
if
you
could
smell
the
cellar
and
the
barrells
this
beer
was
aged
in
it
does
sweeten
and
round
out
a
bit
as
it
warms
more
funk
as
well
the
softness
on
the
palate
combined
with
the
acidic
bite
really
makes
this
beer
come
together
takes
a
little
while
to
drink
this
one
but
that
doesnt
exactly
translate
into
a
low
drinkability
for
me
its
something
that
should
be
appreciated
at
whatever
pace
suits
it
best
an
impressive
beer
for
sure
from
the
experts
of
lambic
tastes
more
sour
than
it
smells
doesnt
seem
as
acidic
as
some
other
gueuzes
ive
had
sweet
and
sour
sour
apples
and
plenty
dirty
as
well
mouthfeel
is
fantastic
lively
and
coating
i
will
have
no
problem
finishing
this
750
im
going
to
pair
it
with
rare
panseared
oven
finished
filet
mignon
in
about
fortyfive
minutes
ill
update
my
review
ive
had
success
in
the
past
with
cantillon
and
filet
other
comments
wow
this
is
a
truly
amazing
geuze
i
bought
this
bottle
some
time
in
2003
i
think
from
cantillon
when
i
was
living
in
brussels
it
has
been
stashed
in
my
cellar
since
then
now
that
im
in
england
and
getting
seriously
bored
with
english
ales
i
decided
to
dig
this
one
up
again
im
both
glad
and
disappointed
that
i
did
glad
because
this
is
just
a
fantastic
beer
disappointed
because
it
is
the
only
bottle
i
had
oh
well
thats
the
problem
with
beer
i
guess
you
end
up
drinking
it
anyway
cantillon
can
sometimes
be
overpowering
especially
to
the
unitiated
but
this
is
very
accessible
would
be
a
great
starter
geuze
and
theres
just
a
little
bit
of
funkiness
going
on
i
really
was
expecting
more
of
that
great
funkadelic
flavor

as
with
all
of
cantillon
brews
though
strictly
speaking
this
is
not
one
and
some
junk
in
my
trunk
the
taste
follows
through
with
a
blast
of
traditional
gueuze
lambic
tartness
and
all
the
traditional
farmyard
flavors
their
is
a
dry
fruitiness
that
makes
this
gueuze
very
fruity
no
fruits
are
needed
to
make
this
a
great
beer
i
am
astonished
by
its
complexity
based
on
the
beers
lower
abv
so
much
going
on
while
every
aspect
is
artfully
integrated
in
the
beers
taste
and
interacts
very
well
with
its
overall
refreshing
character
difficult
to
detail
this
gueuzes
they
are
nice
though
this
is
the
first
cantillon
ive
had
and
man
was
i
impressed
smoothest
gueuze
ive
ever
had
i
now
understand
why
theyre
rated
so
highly
i
have
to
say
this
just
aint
my
thing
smelled
like
someones
sweaty
old
socks
tasted
pretty
good
and
got
better
after
letting
it
sit
a
bit
but
i
just
dont
get
it
with
this
one
sorry
funky
fruity
nose
with
traces
of
of
grapefruit
lemon
must
wet

and
wet

one
of
the
best
gueuzes
out
there
for
sure
not
necessarily
my
number

but
definitely
in
the
top
three
cracked
a
2011
with
some
friends
loved
everything
about
it
delicate

very

smack
you

for
my
taste
its
a
too
much
acid
beer
i
didnt
enjoy
drinking
it
outstanding
cantillon
offering
loved
this
one
and
would
like
to
get
my
hand
on
more
loons
in
the
future
first
time
trying
a
lambictoo
different
for
my
taste
the
cantillon
brewery
tour
was
great
though
too
much
funk
for
me
ive
heard
horse
blanket
this
has
a
touch
of
horse
piss
ive
had
some
amazing
belgian
sours
and
amazing
american
sours
while
ive
waited
for
this
whale
to
hit
a
shelf
near
me
i
love
it
i
see
why
its
the
benchmark
and
i
know
i
want
it
every
time
ill
be
able
to
get
it
funky
in
a
wet
hay
barnyard
way
fully
sour
and
barrelly
delicious
i
love
how
it
hits
you
with
something
epic
at
every
stage
and
the
finish
is
so
enjoyable
really
i
love
this
thing
and
love
how
its
influenced
so
many
dope
sour
brews
a
fantastically
perfect
example
of
what
a
gueuze
should
be
the
two
clowns
who
reviewed
this
beer
before
me
didnt
review
the
beer
properly
anyway
more
cantillon
for
the
rest
of
us
incomparably
outstanding
supremely
tart
dont
plan
on
drinking
anything
else
the
rest
of
the
day
felt
like
i
had
8oz
of
liquid
gold
in
front
of
me
i
was
forced
to
order
another
immediately
i
feel
lucky
to
have
been
able
to
dry
this
on
draft
i
visited
the
brewery
in
antwerp
and
the
beers
are
so
fresh
and
well
kept
pours
a
gorgeous
light
orange
color
flavor
is
highly
acidic
with
a
dry
tartness
flavor
of
sour
lemons
tannic
bitter
finish
always
a
pleasure
well
worth
the
visit
if
you
are
in
brussels
overall
i
am
not
an
expert
on
this
style
but
it
seems
like
a
very
solid
gueuze
great
representation
o
i
feel
like
this
beer
is
the
sum
of
its
parts
yes
its
very
sour
and
has
a
good
amount
of
funk
but
combined
with
the
bright
aroma
and
perfect
and
approachable
mouthfeel
it
makes
this
beer
fun
to
drink
and
you
always
go
back
for
another
overall
very
very
nice
as
always
cantillon
delivers
for
a
straight
ahead
gueuze
lambic
that
does
not
rely
on
additional
flavoring
of
spices
and
fruits
this
is
a
work
of
art
and
shows
that
cantillon
is
one
of
if
not
the
best
brewery
making
sours
today
simple
in
its
approach
yet
somehow
resulting
in
extreme
complexity
i
have
but
no
choice
to
age
a
few
of
these
little
babies
would
love
to
trade
for
this
beer
o
probably
the
best
example
of
this
style
i
have
ever
had
worth
the
splurge
o
my
only
negative
is
the
low
level
of
carbonation
and
that
may
just
be
a
variation
in
the
bottle
i
had
otherwise
this
is
an
absolutely
fantastic
gueuze
that
i
cant
wait
to
try
again
o
not
the
best
gueuze
ive
had
but
definitely
a
good
one
if
the
bitterness
wasnt
there
it
would
be
way
better

has
some
nuances

complexities
each
sip
seems
to
reveal
different
flavours
not
mind
blowing
but
one
of
the
best
withing
the
style
that
ive
had

with

on

delivers
a

experience
on
the
palate
as
well

medium
body
and
a
very
light
carbonation
level
nice
lingering
flavor
slightest
bit
of
slightly
touching
your
sweet
taste
buds
and
then
tart
and
sour
in
a
natural
earthy
sort
of
way
not
overpowering
and
has
a
nice
clean
feel
all
the
way
to
the
finish
really
drinkable
thank
you
for
the
christmas
present
from
my
wife
via
the
bbg
thanks
to
both
of
you
very
nice
beer
not
exactly
my
style
but
id
drink
it
again
gotta
love
the
belgian
funk
some
apple
sweetness
lemon
tartness
you
can
taste
the
funk
as
well
manages
to
avoid
any
off
vinegaracidic
unpleasantry
a
really
well
balanced
gueuze
from
the
best
o
remarkably
wellbalanced
wonderful
bottle
surprisingly
at
world
of
beer
in
tioga
20
for
a
375
ml
was
a
bit
much
but
oh
well
pours
clear
deep
golden
color
with
nearly
no
head
at
all
into
my
champagne
flute
aroma
of
vinegar
apricots
mint
leaves
sour
fruits
interesting
aroma
flavor
follows
closely
with
a
surprisingly
juicy
fruit
flavor
some
sour
lacto
notes
but
not
super
acidic
at
all
sweet
fruits
like
apricots
and
very
very
light
oak
the
mouthfeel
is
fuller
than
most
geuezes
i
have
encountered
not
dry
at
all
like
others
and
the
oaky
wood
presence
is
extremely
subdued
here
low
to
medium
carbonation
while
this
was
a
bit
different
from
others
of
the
style
it
was
excellent
with
lots
of
juicy
sour
fruity
flavor
highly
recommended
oi
need
to
say
that
lambics
arent
my
thing
this
is
the
first
cantillon
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
trying
and
im
clearly
still
developing
a
taste
for
sours
that
being
said
this
was
terrific
the
sourtartness
created
such
a
crisp
and
pleasureful
beer
that
was
great
to
drink
i
will
definitely
seek
out
more
the
nose
is
sublime
for
a
gueze
funky
and
acidic
the
flavor
is
there
but
note
subtle
than
expected
i
was
wanting
more
of
a
punch
great
beer
but
this
doesnt
stand
up
to
hanssens
gueze
b
my
first
cantillon
i
quite
liked
it
an
expertly
blended
sour
and
aged
belgian
ale
many
flavours
stand
out
sure
but
are
best
appreciated
as
a
whole
its
like
an
experience
in
lambic
wizardry
make
it
sour
and
funky
and
somehow
easily
drinkable
and
enjoyable
at
the
same
time
glad
to
have
finally
gotten
the
opportunity
to
try
this
one
everyone
who
thinks
that
they
like
sour
beers
should
be
afforded
the
same
this
beer
is
not
bitter
or
sour
it
is
more
like
a
flavored
water
and
it
drinks
very
easy
you
may
consider
having
another
one
available
perfect
lovely
beer
easy
to
see
why
its
considered
among
the
best
in
the
style
overall
i
really
enjoyed
it
although
like
i
said
i
am
relatively
new
to
sours
it
was
perfect
for
the
first
day
of
spring
o
very
very
good
although
there
is
less
funk
than
i
expected
at
least
on
draft
truly
a
very
good
beer
pour
is
golden
amber
with
white
head
nose
is
soft
funk
earthy
and
a
touch
of
mushroom
fair
bit
of
apricot
and
a
hint
of
mineral
taste
follows
the
nose
earthy
mushroom
and
lots
of
apricot
minerally
and
strong
carb
with
a
light
creamy
body
some
light
hops
to
round
out
through
finish
light
golden
color
with
head
reducing
to
ring
of
lacing
wonderful
aromas
of
fruit
apple
grape
peach
with
a
slightly
sour
nose
taste
is
fruity
rush
up
front
with
lemon
apple
grape
slightly
sweet
almost
like
a
dry
riesling
followed
by
sour
notes
both
lactic
and
mild
acetic
which
dwindle
into
a
dry
oaky
tannic
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
inviting
with
effervescent
carbonation
over
an
ever
so
slightly
viscous
beer
the
flavors
combine
into
a
light
flavorful
complex
and
wonderful
beverage
i
expected
more
funk
perhaps
that
comes
with
age
a
different
experience
the
3f
og
a
bit
more
refined
and
lighter
on
the
brett
characteristics
terrific
gueuze
worth
seeking
out
o
a
fantastic
beer
o
not
the
most
sour
gueuze
ever
and
thats
a
good
thing
the
balance
brings
out
complexity
absolutely
one
of
the
best
in
the
world
o
wonderful
enjoyed
this
while
on
vacation
was
my
second
time
having
it
and
was
not
disappointed
i
guess
the
only
negative
would
be
that
everything
else
i
drank
on
that
trip
paled
in
comparison
to
the
cantillon
seriously
one
of
the
best
gueuzes
out
there
if
you
have
a
chance
to
try
it
savor
every
drop
o
one
of
the
best
bottles
anyone
can
buy
nowadays
o
i
had
a
bottle
of
this
and
was
very
disappointed
im
glad
i
got
to
try
it
on
tap
because
i
now
understand
why
its
a
world
class
beer
and
i
hope
to
try
it
many
more
times
in
the
future
o
a
beer
that
represents
a
style
a
very
good
one
at
doing
this
very
complex
nice
balance
and
drinkabilty
despite
strong
tartness
excellent
o
a
great
and
classic
example
of
the
style
hence
its
name
very
drinkable
refreshing
and
interesting
but
not
as
much
funk
as
i
would
like
but
i
can
see
why
this
is
a
bench
mark
for
the
style
this
bottle
is
relatively
young
so
im
extremely
interested
to
see
how
it
ages
well
worth
a
try
and
will
continue
to
snatch
this
every
time
i
see
it
also
nest
time
i
will
serve
this
slightly
above
the
recommended
5055
deg
f
since
i
thought
it
improved
as
it
warmed
medium
body
with
soft
carbonation
and
delicate
sourness
tart
and
puckering
with
a
decent
amount
of
earthy
lactic
funk
but
not
harsh
or
overly
acidic
dry
oakdamp
wood
flavor
but
not
toothpicklike
or
overwhelming
some
cheesy
lactic
funk
with
musty
bugs
straw
and
earthy
grass
countered
by
pale
malt
bread
estery
fruit
sweetness
and
citrus
acidity
really
well
balanced
with
biscuity
malt
sourdough
bread
sweet
apple
and
tart
lemon
juice
flavor
lingering
acetic
vinegar
presence
in
the
finish
that
leaves
me
salivating
for
more
no
harsh
or
solventlike
off
flavors
to
be
found
perfectly
balanced
and
extremely
easy
to
drink
which
is
surprising
considering
this
beers
complexity
just
an
overall
amazing
beer
exemplary
for
the
style
overall
this
is
a
top
notch
gueuze
its
strength
is
its
incredible
balance
very
tasty
great
aroma
and
the
right
level
of
sour
definitely
a
goto
gueuze
for
all
occasions
overall
outstanding
also
comes
off
as
very
approachable
and
drinkable
a
classic
indeed
this
is
a
very
complex
and
tasty
beer
thats
not
too
heavy
on
the
sourtartness
its
easy
drinking
but
each
sip
should
be
savored
o
wow
super
good
this
ale
certainly
lives
up
to
expectations
it
is
very
clean
and
light
the
neutral
oak
is
nicely
balanced
with
the
medium
tartness
level
the
only
drawback
is
the
burpiness
that
builds
up
in
ones
stomach
if
you
ever
see
this
or
any
cantillon
drink
it
im
wishing
i
had
a
hot
summers
day
to
do
with
this
one
but
i
have
no
complaints
even
on
this
chilly
evening
im
a
little
surprised
it
took
me
so
long
to
rate
the
easiest
to
find
cantillon
but
i
was
bound
to
get
t
it
sooner
or
later
wow
cantillon
gueuze
never
fails
to
impress
at
first
the
sourness
hits
you
and
dominates
the
experience
but
after
a
while
the
other
flavours
make
themselves
felt
the
aroma
and
flavour
are
superbly
balanced
and
the
body
is
wonderful
the
only
minor
flaw
was
a
slight
lack
of
effervescence
but
each
bottle
is
different
quite
simply
a
worldclass
brew
that
demands
to
be
tried
o
excellent
the
body
was
light
crisp
sharp
and
had
a
very
dry
finish
drinkability
was
excellent
if
you
like
light
tart
crisp
and
dry
beverages
overall
its
hard
to
imagine
the
style
being
done
better
very
possibly
the
standard
by
which
the
others
are
judged
a
must
try
if
you
see
it
overall
just
a
great
gueuze
probably
the
most
representative
of
the
style
that
ive
had
right
up
there
with
tilquin
for
sure
o
as
this
was
a
complementary
bottle
from
the
owner
of
the
jeffrey
it
may
have
been
even
more
enjoyable
than
it
already
would
have
been
and
considering
the
quality
of
this
beer
that
is
great
probably
one
of
the
most
perfect
examples
of
the
style
in
my
opinion
it
is
truly
a
classic
strong
sour
flavors
but
exactly
what
you
would
expect
for
the
style
cantillons
classic
gueuze
is
everything
its
modest
name
implies
and
more
with
a
honeylike
appearance
and
a
cap
of
pure
white
bubbles
its
simply
beautiful
its
only
minimal
haze
shows
that
it
is
lightly
carbonated
it
shines
radiantly
the
sweet
aroma
reminds
one
of
plums
sour
apple
cider
vinegar
and
a
slight
barnyard
funk
the
flavor
envelops
the
drinker
in
stages
right
off
the
bat
tart
fruit
esters
like
sour
cherry
and
the
aforementioned
plum
wash
over
the
palate
quickly
giving
way
to
a
funkyyeasty
middle
and
a
strong
grapefruitcitrus
aspect
the
mouth
feel
is
slightly
winelike
and
seriously
has
something
in
common
with
fresh
spring
water
its
so
very
refreshing
the
finish
mostly
acidic
and
crisply
bitter
overall
this
fine
beverage
is
expertly
balanced
probably
the
biggest
remarkable
aspect
here
additionally
its
not
so
harsh
going
down
either
its
rather
delicate
and
drinkable
cantillons
gueuze
is
truly
an
archetype
for
the
style
prost
the
scariest
thing
about
a
beer
this
complex
is
how
easily
drinkable
it
is
i
could
have
this
in
a
long
session
without
ever
growing
tired
of
it
im
excited
to
try
the
bottled
version
of
this
and
see
how
it
differs
this
really
is
terms
of
basic
oude
gueuzes
a
top
quality
standard
and
a
real
privilege
to
be
able
to
drink
whenever
the
opportunity
arises
without
a
doubt
one
of
my
favorite
sours
i
just
wish
it
were
more
affordable
and
accessible
served
in
a
little
cantillon
glass
the
pour
is
a
clearish
yellow
with
a
skimpy
head
that
results
in
some
minor
lacing
the
smell
is
a
juicy
sour
melange
of
hay
melon
grape
green
apple
and
lemon
sour
funky
flavor
slightly
acetic
but
not
over
the
top
lemons
limes
puckering
apple
and
some
oak
wood
tannins
dry
tart
and
crisp
just
an
excellent
gueuze
that
i
could
have
kept
drinking
for
the
remainder
of
the
night
if
money
were
no
object
othe
flavors
meshed
perfectly
the
funk
was
there
nice
and
sour
an
amazing
beer
o
this
is
great
a
very
interesting
sour
treat
poured
a
dark
gold
cloudy
body
with
two
finger
head
that
dies
slow
and
left
some
lace
patches
down
glass
has
a
pronounced
tartsour
edge
but
there
are
very
noticeable
traits
of
spice
funk
fruit
smells
like
apple
and
pear
and
grape
skinn
kinda
like
a
white
wine
and
a
touch
of
sweet
fruit
or
sugary
malt
the
beer
is
lively
thanks
to
strong
carbonation
has
a
spice
and
citric
hop
zip
to
it
get
some
sweet
notes
and
some
fruit
flavors
like
the
tart
apple
and
grape
besides
being
filling
the
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
beer
passes
easy
thanks
to
oakiness
and
the
finish
is
so
crisp
yet
sweet
overall
a
little
bit
of
everything
is
in
this
beer
although
dont
be
confused
because
the
overriding
taste
sensation
is
sourness
but
the
balance
is
great
and
this
is
an
incredible
beer
that
if
you
find
you
need
to
pick
up
drinkability
its
a
very
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
with
great
flavors
and
aromas
smells
like
an
old
basement
a
cellar
perhaps
nutty
lemon
yeast
cheese
rind
its
a
great
beer
but
cantillon
does
better
and
i
think
id
take
3f
and
de
cam
standard
gueuze
over
this
one
got
lucky
enough
to
try
this
before
i
even
knew
about
cantillon
this
was
probably
only
the
fifth
or
sixth
sour
beer
i
had
ever
tried
but
damn
it
was
good
its
too
bad
its
never
around
it
really
made
me
understand
the
difference
between
the
american
sour
experimentations
and
a
true
belgium
gueuze
im
hooked
more
please
o
a
reference
for
the
style
very
good
but
doesnt
blow
me
away
3f
is
easier
to
find
and
at
least
as
good
a
nice
reward
for
finishing
packing
1998
vintage
750ml
thanks
to
turdferguson
at
rbsg
2011
in
philly
the
pour
is
similar
looking
to
loerik
with
a
clear
to
hazy
neon
peach
color
and
scant
white
head
formation
nose
is
completely
insane
just
nothing
comes
close
to
this
one
wild
amounts
of
sour
peaches
sweet
oranges
fresh
grapefruit
and
soft
sour
funk
that
has
no
spice
or
vinegar
only
fresh
citrus
and
unreal
amounts
of
it
perfect
aroma
taste
is
leathery
and
sharp
with
mild
sweat
and
bitter
grapefruit
excellent
soft
leathery
palate
what
an
insanely
amazing
treat
if
you
have
ever
dreamed
about
what
loerik
tastes
like
this
is
it
they
are
both
1998
batches
and
have
aged
very
similarly

your
face
with
a
solid
hit
of
grass
and
hay
with
a
bit
of
bretty
funkiness
that
lingers
and
swirls
the
flavor
is
a
bit
sour
with
lemons
and
pomme
fruits
being
dominant
a
hint
of
honey
sweetness
before
a
bready
bretty
yeastiness
takes
over
long
tart
puckering
finish

for
a
cleanse
of
the
palette
which
i
am
all
too
happy
to
oblige

a
t
s
m
at
that
time
disregard
those
scores
overall
definite
a
i
have
no
problem
spending
11
bucks
for
a
beer
like
this
its
a
must
try
unless
you
dont
like
sours
overall
impression
a
mellowed
version
of
the
15
month
lambic
with
sour
and
acidic
notes
toned
down
also
with
the
addition
of
the
3
year
lambic
it
achieves
that
musty
barnyard
flavor
that
is
so
desired
in
a
proper
geuze
the
375
ml
was
a
perfect
amount
im
still
slowly
getting
into
this
beer
but
this
really
was
a
wonderful
treat
raul
likes
it
raul
likes
it
well
and
good
othis
is
another
solid
offering
from
cantillon
it
is
wellbalanced
and
the
long
finish
is
pleasingly
tart
although
i
may
not
rate
it
as
high
as
my
favorite
gueuze
golden
blend
i
would
happily
drink
this
all
day
long
if
my
stomach
could
handle
the
acidity
worth
the
hype
i
would
say
cantillon
makes
outstanding
beers
and
are
turning
me
around
on
lambics
and
sours
this
is
surely
one
of
the
finest
out
there
with
deft
complexity
and
balance
definitely
one
to
savour
and
sip
a
very
pleasing
allround
experience
4

d
great
complex
and
balanced
gueuze
overall
excellent
as
expected
this
isnt
really
any
better
than
3f
or
tilquin
offerings
but
it
has
its
subtle
differences
either
way
its
world
class
and
worth
trying
the
flavor
is
of
a
bottle
kept
at
the
brewery
with
fresh
tangy
element
with
lightly
lactic
acidic
and
not
quite
puckering
sour
with
nice
wood
in
the
taste
with
light
vinous
almost
white
grape
tang
with
no
bitterness
and
semisour
lemony
juicy
flavor
with
mild
wood
coming
throughwith
no
alcohol
in
the
taste
as
the
flavor
is
dry
when
it
finishes
with
a
linger
tart
experience
lingering
i
loved
this
it
is
great
to
try
it
in
the
place
where
it
is
produced
it
just
is
great
in
every
wayveyr
smooth
yet
has
such
complexity
for
so
low
abv
with
truly
special
traditional
beer
that
is
better
than
the
majority
in
the
style
verdict
a
wonderful
gueuze
from
cantillon
and
one
of
the
finest
gueuzes
available
i
personally
prefer
the
gueuzes
from
drie
fonteinen
but
find
that
cantillon
makes
the
superior
fruited
lambic
but
this
gueuze
is
nothing
to
scoff
at
a
delight
to
drink
o
this
is
an
amazing
gueuze
i
prefer
the
balance
in
this
one
compared
to
the
funkier
versions
brewed
up
by
3f
both
are
excellent
though
and
i
will
gladly
drink
either
of
them
any
day
while
people
are
going
crazy
trying
to
get
all
the
rare
cantillons
with
various
fruits
and
barrel
treatments
i
find
that
the
flavor
of
the
classic
gueuze
is
already
pretty
much
perfect
i
could
drink
this
forever
waited
a
long
time
for
this
and
got
a
chance
when
i
was
least
expecting
it
very
smooth
and
flavorful
not
funky
or
overly
tart
and
yet
not
too
mild
or
tame
just
the
right
amount
of
sourness
and
fruits
great
mouthfeel
and
very
satisfying
from
beginning
to
end
in
fact
its
so
smooth
and
delicious
it
goes
down
too
fast
which
is
a
bit
of
a
problem
considering
its
high
price
tag
but
if
you
like
this
style
its
worth
trying
at
least
once
maybe
a
sharer
in
the
future
as
a
beer
appetizer
superb
o
a
little
sweeter
and
fruitier
than
its
peers
i
prefer
drie
fonteinen
but
this
is
certainly
a
well
made
gueuze
and
a
pleasure
to
drink
overall
4
5
a
classic
beer
and
probably
the
benchmark
for
the
style
its
easy
to
forget
just
why
it
is
such
a
reknowned
beer
when
youve
not
had
it
for
awhile
im
glad
that
i
was
able
to
get
a
pour
or
few
on
tap
for
zwanze
day
rekindling
that
old
love
for
this
belgian
standardbearer
o
im
new
to
this
style
of
beer
but
this
one
is
a
winner
regardless
of
style
a
well
made
and
delicious
beer
that
can
and
will
get
people
interested
in
sours
o
great
geuze
nice
lemon
zest
flavor
and
very
mellow
feel
and
high
drinkability
for
a
sour
one
of
the
top
5
wildssours
ive
had
this
was
a
real
treat
thanks
a
ton
kawilliams81
theres
no
wonder
why
this
stuff
is
so
highly
praised
its
fantastic
theres
truly
no
recreation
or
replica
of
a
beer
like
this
masterfully
done
definitely
a
benchmark
of
the
classic
gueuze
style
if
this
were
readily
available
to
me
you
can
bet
that
my
fridge
would
be
stocked
with
it
all
day
i
might
have
a
stomach
ulcer
from
all
the
acid
but
it
might
be
worth
it
for
this
o
solid
with
great
balance
between
the
tartness
and
funk
i
thought
this
was
tarter
but
had
less
funk
that
the
3f
gueuze
o
still
getting
in
to
the
style
and
this
was
one
of
the
more
enjoyable
ones
i
have
had
to
date
o
i
have
yet
to
be
totally
blown
away
by
sours
but
im
not
going
to
let
two
beers
characterize
an
entire
style
for
me
unless
its
aals
i
wish
there
was
a
little
more
booze
in
it
but
its
definitely
balanced
less
sharp
sweeter
better
blanced
than
the
lambic
the
carbonation
really
helps
with
the
acidity
and
makes
it
much
more
refreshing
overall
this
was
a
step
in
the
right
direction
for
me
but
not
quite
the
flavor
profile
i
prefer
in
a
gueuze
there
is
an
attempt
at
balancing
the
mouldy
musty
flavors
with
the
tartness
which
is
much
appreciated
it
is
a
quality
gueuze
with
a
very
good
feel
to
boot
but
just
not
quite
my
style
this
mixed
really
really
well
with
the
tilquin
though
so
dont
be
afraid
to
give
that
a
try
golden
and
clear
with
hints
of
redorange
and
a
bubbly
head
champagneesque
effervescence
medium
retention
funky
musty
somewhat
sweet
aroma
slightly
metallic
lemon
and
oak
tannins
in
the
taste
with
a
drying
sour
finish
very
clean
and
crisp
with
a
lingering
presence
of
tannins
and
slight
pucker
very
nice
but
i
think
i
like
3fs
better
o
this
is
just
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
every
aspect
of
this
beer
is
amazing
o
funky
light
and
wonderful
a
classic
for
sure
finally
got
my
hands
on
this
one
surprisingly
mild
for
the
style
ive
had
tarter
more
sour
and
funky
gueuze
it
was
good
but
nothing
special
really
maybe
the
10
i
have
will
be
better
this
was
a
12
good
drinking
top
class
look
forward
to
cellaring
one
next
time
overall
seriously
enjoyable
great
on
a
nice
day
such
as
this
exactly
what
i
was
in
the
mood
for
always
nice
when
things
work
out
that
way
body
is
medium
weight
with
very
fine
carbonation
bubbling
up
quickly
to
create
a
smooth
and
fairly
creamy
mouthfeel
closes
dry
from
acid
with
a
bit
of
stickiness
around
the
lips
and
with
fair
burning
sensation
from
acids
on
the
throat
m
super
dry
tiny
bubbles
big
carbonation
o
great
drinkability
the
perfect
gueuze
a
masterpiece
o
amazing
beer
what
all
guezes
should
shoot
for
triple
g
beer
here
great
goddamn
gueuze
oa
lot
more
mellow
on
the
sourness
and
funk
then
i
was
expecting
but
very
drinkable
a
smooth
relative
to
other
gueuzes
ive
had
this
was
a
2011
bottling
375ml
overall
i
am
fairly
new
to
the
style
of
gueuze
had
a
few
and
i
have
enjoyed
them
this
beer
is
no
exception
i
was
really
excited
to
see
this
beer
at
the
malthouse
while
pass
through
madison
on
a
snowy
december
night
overall
i
cannot
believe
this
is
the
first
time
i
am
reviewing
this
beer
but
i
am
not
surprised
by
its
excellent
quality
like
most
gueuzes
i
have
experienced
the
aromas
usually
outweigh
the
taste
but
i
think
that
is
just
my
enjoyment
of
each
aspect
of
the
style
i
bet
these
beers
could
age
for
decades
and
will
continute
to
improve
and
develop
new
and
interesting
funky
and
sour
components
anyway
this
was
super
and
i
hope
to
taste
older
versions
down
the
line
o
my
first
loon
was
not
a
letdown
this
is
an
excellent
beer
probably
the
best
gueuze
ive
ever
had
if
only
i
could
drink
this
one
more
often
absolutely
delicious
overall
my
first
fresh
loon
and
it
shows
funk
is
turned
down
but
the
lactic
sourness
still
shines
great
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
but
i
liked
the
unblended
2year
lambic
much
better
simply
stunningly
smooth
creamy
head
from
my
pour
that
hides
the
gorgeous
pale
body
of
ale
beneath
it
laces
beautifully
and
retains
rather
well
nose
is
rich
in
aromas
with
sour
fruits
and
barnyard
but
barnyard
with
mostly
animal
aromas
and
not
so
much
the
stuff
that
comes
out
their
rear
ends
that
can
exist
in
a
barnyard
aroma
palate
is
decadent
with
flavor
sour
fruits
such
as
peach
and
lemon
silky
smooth
carbonation
is
a
joy
on
the
palate
too
and
more
of
the
barnyardbrett
qualities
appearing
in
an
extremely
pleasant
way
so
sour
so
tart
and
lacking
in
any
substantive
flaws
a
delight
to
drink

wish
i
had
a
case
of
these
to
sit
on
o
one
of
the
best
gueuzes
you
can
find
seek
this
out
o
everything
i
expect
in
the
style
its
difficult
to
describe
these
beers
but
i
know
its
one
of
the
most
delicious
on
the
planet
pours

a
great
meal
beer
that
isnt
to
heavy
and
compliments
a
variety
of
dishes
maybe
a
bit
over
hyped
but
quite
different
from
a
typical
aipa
o
mmm
cantillon
classic
everything
i
thought
it
would
be
and
for
an
amazing
price
i
think
7
for
a
375ml
at
whole
foods
in
sfo
excellent
could
drink
this
every
day
much
like
the
normal
tap
version
this
was
a
slightly
hazy
goldenyellow
liquid
served
in
a
stem
glass
a
small
fizzy
white
head
quickly
dissipated
leaving
a
few
stray
bubbles

about

good
for
the
style
im
just
not
nuts
about
it
omy
favorite
gueuze
thus
far
nice
body
and
flavor
oi
love
classic
gueuzegueuze
bioetc
so
i
always
think
its
a
treat
to
have
i
prefer
3f
oude
gueuze
in
terms
of
standard
gueuzes
but
this
is
probably
a
close
second
thanks
for
bringing
this
baron
this
is
a
delicious
and
wonderful
example
of
the
style
it
appears
cloudy
and
lemon
juice
colored
with
a
small
white
head
comprised
of
big
round
bubbles
the
rise
pretty
aggressively
on
the
pour
acidic
citrus
peel
and
tart
lactic
acid
are
what
i
smell
almost
stings
my
nose
to
breathe
this
in
deeply
the
flavor
is
also
very
tart
and
lemon
seems
to
be
the
predominant
flavor
although
some
wild
sour
yeast
is
also
doing
its
part
to
keep
this
tart
its
wheaty
but
not
heavy
the
mouthfeel
is
in
fact
really
light
and
if
it
wasnt
so
intensely
acidic
it
might
come
off
as
quite
delicate
really
the
carbonation
is
good
but
thats
the
biggest
critique
i
have
with
this
i
like
my
gueuze
effervescently
bright
and
this
one
seems
a
little
flat
to
me
not
flat
flat
but
just
less
bubbly
than
i
know
the
style
to
be
maybe
my
bottle
wasnt
the
most
fresh
but
it
lacked
that
sonic
carbonation
overall
though
this
is
as
the
label
says
the
classis
gueuze
famous
for
a
reason
o
in
my
opinion
this
is
the
gold
standard
for
the
standard
gueze
style
i
cant
imagine
it
getting
much
better
than
this
overall
this
is
probably
the
best
sour
i
have
had
to
date
the
only
beer
that
is
close
would
be
cantillon
iris
but
that
was
aged
a
year
or
two
more
and
on
tap
i
guess
i
dont
get
cantillon
take
this
review
with
a
grain
of
salt
if
you
love
cantillon
youll
probably
love
this
too
if
you
dont
dont
expect
this
to
convert
you
overall
i
know
its
the
standard
for
gueuzes
but
id
take
drie
fonteinen
any
day
over
this
not
many
other
things
id
take
over
it
though
to
complain
about
it
is
splitting
hairs
drinkability
a
bit
on
the
sour
side
for
my
taste
o
the
archetype
of
the
style
wish
i
could
have
left
it
in
my
cellar
even
longer
but
i
couldnt
resist
o
this
was
a
very
good
gueze
however
probably
not
my
favorite
i
think
i
actually
liked
hannsenns
slightly
more
then
this
it
was
very
drinkable
had
a
nice
light
funk
to
it
and
is
definitely
something
id
like
to
drink
again
maybe
a
different
vintage
i
would
recommend
this
to
any
geuzesour
lover
o
good
drinkability
a
phenomenal
sour
i
can
see
why
cantillon
is
so
sought
after
had
this
on
tap
once
in
chicago
and
its
good
as
i
remember
it
being
wish
i
could
get
this
even
every
once
in
a
while
cost
14
for
a
12
oz
bottle
at
the
bar
but
a
750
ml
bottle
if
you
are
lucky
enough
to
find
one
in
a
retail
store
stateside
tends
to
run
15
overall
a
really
excellent
gueuze
probably
a
great
place
to
start
if
youre
new
to
the
style
overall
a
fairly
complex
sour
not
a
beginners
choice
very
tart
and
dry
and
refreshing
o
this
gueuze
has
a
reputation
as
being
one
of
the
best
out
there
and
i
cant
say
anything
to
contradict
that
this
is
as
complex
and
enticing
as
any
of
cantillons
other
products
i
cant
recommend
this
one
highly
enough
for
fans
of
sour
ales
a
longtime
want
of
mine
that
surely
didnt
disappoint
o
fantastic
i
wish
i
could
get
a
hold
of
this
more
often
wouldnt
be
a
daily
drinker
but
was
obviously
a
marvelously
brewed
beer
i
previously
had
an
longer
aged
example
of
this
beer
which
was
much
more
complex
the
sourness
and
funk
really
jumped
out
however
even
fresh
this
beer
is
near
perfect
served
from
a
bottle
at
the
brewery
poured
into
a
small
wine
snifter
smells
like
the
straight
lambic
with
greater
depth
and
stratification
of
flavor
the
depth
of
cereal
grains
cheese
earth
and
wild
yeast
is
fantastic
as
well
as
the
balance
of
acids
this
is
fantastically
well
done
and
complex
while
still
being
approachable
not
overly
sour
or
harsh
but
every
bit
as
wild
as
it
should
be
this
bears
no
resemblance
to
the
pasteurized
and
sweetened
gueuze
that
is
too
often
found
of
the
shelves
today
real
wild

amber
with
a
small
white
head

light
sulfur
note
and
some
earthiness
the
taste
has
a
big
lactic
tartness
with
lemon
slight
horseradish
and
lots
of
funky
brett
the
finish
is
tart
with
earthy
brett
medium
body
low
carbonation
dry
throughout
this
was
drank
side
by
side
with
a
3f
oude
geuze
i
slightly
preferred
the
3f
but
this
was
still
great
i
suspect
that
the
slight
sulfur
note
will
go
away
with
some
age
and
this
beer
will
get
even
better
o
tried
two
days
after
having
beatification
and
the
two
are
comparable
in
quality
i
prefer
this
one
both
because
its
a
classic
and
because
its
more
rounded
where
the
beatification
is
sharp
t
hits
with
a
bit
punch
of
sourness
with
an
edge
of
funk
to
it
lemon
a
touch
of
faint
spice
sour
plum
and
some
green
apple
as
well
some
hints
of
wood
and
earth
on
the
finish
the
taste
isnt
as
in
your
face
as
some
of
the
other
geuzes
ive
had
but
i
think
i
actually
like
that
better
this
is
really
really
good
this
beer
is
delicious
meticulously
crafted
and
blended
everything
playing
well
together
this
is
welcome
in
my
fridge
any
time
o
a
beer
for
sure
again
the
euros
just
do
it
better
o
it
was
just
very
sour
but
nothing
much
else
it
smelled
better
than
it
tasted
this
though
did
not
have
any
distracting
taste
or
smell
i
was
able
to
finish
the
entire
the
bottle
and
enjoyed
it
but
its
not
something
i
will
be
seeking
again
o
really
enjoyed
this
beer
thought
it
had
the
best
combination
of
funksourness
of
the
group
would
drink
this
everyday
if
i
could
find
it
and
afford
it
i
love
the
sourness
so
naturally
this
is
my
favorite
geuze
o
this
is
a
legend
my
experience
with
sours
is
limited
but
this
is
right
up
there
with
the
russian
river
offerings
but
is
very
different
indeed
from
those
beers
comparing
it
to
the
only
eve
gueuze
id
had
before
by
lindemanns
this
beer
is
miiles
ahead
in
spite
of
the
intense
sourness
and
tartness
this
beer
is
still
very
easy
to
drink
and
fantastically
delicious
this
would
be
incredible
with
a
ribeye
with
some
aged
bleu
cheese
cantillon
gueuze
is
an
an
amazingly
complex
fantastically
balanced
and
remarkably
refreshing
beer
although
people
usually
comment
on
its
intensity
i
found
my
example
to
be
exceptionably
smooth
and
drinkable
i
would
love
to
get
my
hands
on
another
bottle
or
two
for
when
the
warm
weather
rolls
around
o
overall
paint
me
impressed
yet
again
cantillion
steps
up
and
backs
up
their
rep
as
good
or
better
than
other
cantillions
ive
had
seems
that
if
it
is
from
cantillion
it
is
safe
to
say
that
it
will
be
tasty
good
lemon
flavoring
with
grassiness
and
hay
and
a
palatable
sourness
just
wish
i
had
some
funky
cheese
to
go
with
this
o
this
is
the
bar
for
a
reason
beautifully
done
and
ill
be
trying
to
get
my
hands
on
more
of
this
in
the
future
o
some
breweries
are
overrated
and
overhyped
and
im
not
just
talking
about
companies
like
dogfish
head
but
even
the
actual
good
ones
say
russian
river
i
like
russian
river
and
drink
their
stuff
regularly
but
they
do
not
deserve
the
hype
heck
i
prefer
cascade
barrel
house
cantillon
and
3
fonteinen
really
do
deserve
their
hype
and
their
wonderful
reviews
the
cantillon
gueuze
is
just
amazingly
balanced
i
can
see
why
some
people
prefer
the
3f
and
i
love
that
one
as
well
but
cantillon
keeps
its
oak
flavor
in
check
thereby
creating
a
beer
that
is
extremely
easy
to
drink
and
exposing
an
array
of
subtle
but
interesting
flavors
a
gracious
drink
a
classic
it
doesnt
get
much
better
than
this
it
does
but
not
by
much
o
i
was
looking
forward
to
this
and
was
not
disappointed
im
a
fan
of
sours
and
im
trying
to
get
more
experience
with
them
this
was
a
terrific
experience
one
thing
that
i
love
about
it
is
that
you
could
give
it
to
someone
who
wasnt
familiar
with
sours
and
they
would
never
in
a
million
years
think
that
it
was
beer
it
just
goes
to
show
you
how
vast
this
wonderful
world
of
beers
is
loved
this
and
highly
recommend
it
overall
a
complex
good
tasting
beer
that
within
the
last
2
years
i
come
upon
far
less
frequently
than
i
like
i
could
tell
myself
xxx
gueuze
is
just
as
good
and
readily
available
but
hell
why
lie
to
myself
o
overall
this
was
my
favourite
gueuze
of
the
night
but
not
by
much
the
appearance
hurt
it
as
did
the
lack
of
a
really
fruity
nose
but
the
oak
and
dry
crisp
clean
mouthfeel
reall
won
this
one
over
great
beer
from
cantillon
this
beer
lived
up
to
all
of
my
expectations
very
glad
that
i
have
one
to
age
could
drink
this
all
day
wsome
tums
this
is
as
close
to
perfect
as
it
gets
benchmark
for
the
style
so
glad
to
have
cantillon
back
in
in
and
to
finally
be
able
to
snag
one
of
these
from
the
shelf
after
several
dry
years
not
as
good
as
their
special
fruit
releases
but
still
one
of
the
better
gueuzes
around
and
pretty
good
bang
for
the
buck
4
5
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
gueuze
very
tart
and
complex
so
easy
to
drink
o
i
loved
this
beer
this
is
my
first
beer
from
cantillon
and
i
am
completely
sold
the
funkiness
and
sourness
of
this
beer
was
unlike
anything
i
have
ever
had
in
a
beer
a
bit
of
an
eyeopener
really
i
will
be
seeking
out
more
sours
like
this
in
the
near
future
pours
a
cloudy
orange
color
w
a
one
finger
off
white
head
excellent
lacing
on
my
tulip
glass
the
nose
is
a
beautiful
musty
barnyard
lemony
smell
really
excellent
the
taste
steps
it
up
a
notch
this
is
a
world
class
fantastic
gueze
unbelievably
complex
with
different
funky
tastes
coming
out
i
cant
think
of
one
thing
i
would
change
about
the
taste
of
this
brew
feel
is
an
acidic
sharp
feel
w
a
nice
smooth
edge
to
it
as
well
overall
this
is
an
awesome
beer
and
im
glad
i
got
to
try
it
cheers
poured

2011
pours
a
cloudy
dark
golden
orange
color
with
tangerine
hues
and
a
one
finger
frothy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
into
a
thin
ring
tarty
funky
earthy
aroma
with
some
musty
lemon
acidity
vinegary
sweetness
along
with
a
strong
citrus
fruit
presence
medium
bodied
with
a
tart
puckering
mouthfeel
and
dry
tart
sourness
that
lingers
throughout
into
a
slightly
acidity
sweet
vinegary
finish
some
oak
with
a
ton
of
sweet
citrus
especially
lemon
and
a
lingering
vinegar
flavor
a
bit
too
tarty
and
acidity
for
me
i
can
see
why
this
is
the
tartsours
of
all
sours
i
can
respect
the
style
though
the
style
is
not
my
style
mouthfeel
was
light
but
the
mouth
puckering
sours
gently
burned
my
tongue
on
every
sip
brilliant
o
simply
put
a
rock
solid
classic
not
quite
great
there
a
better
ones
out
there
but
really
really
good
well
done
again
cantillon
finally
got
to
try
this
classic
belgian
ale
the
appearance
is
very
nice
with
a
golden
orange
color
topped
by
a
eggshell
white
head
and
rimmed
with
generous
lacing
the
smell
is
a
complex
but
unified
sour
funk
blast
with
hay
funk
earth
apple
skin
and
lemon
rind
the
taste
follows
suit
with
a
fairly
harsh
sourness
that
hits
the
spot
nicely
mouthfeel
is
soft
and
creamy
and
the
beer
really
gets
the
saliva
going
overall
quite
good
do
very
well
balanced
with
great
complexity
that
isnt
overdone
tasty
funky
tart
delicious
i
could
sip
on
a
few
of
these
all
day
long
a
great
example
of
the
style
but
the
tartness
was
just
a
touch
toned
down
for
me
fortunately
i
have
a
few
more
bottles
to
sit
on
for
a
couple
years
cant
wait
to
try
it
again
down
the
road
o
a
very
drinkable
tart
gueuze
absolutely
delicious
this
beer
is
a
winner
overall
just
way
too
sour
for
me
ive
enjoyed
other
lambic
styles
but
this
is
just
too
much
sour
overall
this
is
the
measuring
bar
of
gueuze
for
me
this
is
the
standard
by
which
all
others
are
to
be
judged
given
that
stature
and
the
bottle
i
am
going
to
guess
that
it
is
cantillon
classic
or
lou
pepe
gueuze
reveal
classic
gueuze
wow
what
a
fantastic
beer
thanks
again
pellinore1
cantillon
classic
pours
a
remarkably
clear
orange
on
the
first
pour
though
subsequent
additions
introduce
some
cloudiness
maybe
two
fingers
of
creamy
white
foam
top
the
beer
and
the
head
lingers
around
for
a
little
bit
nothing
at
all
left
in
the
way
of
lacing
though
theres
a
ton
to
sift
through
in
the
nose
complex
barnyard
funk
takes
the
lead
theres
also
some
light
white
pepper
oak
and
a
touch
of
vinegar
that
serve
to
keep
things
lively
the
flavor
keeps
to
the
spirit
of
the
nose
though
the
beers
a
little
bit
more
tart
than
the
aroma
would
have
let
on
the
heavy
funk
redolent
of
wet
hay
is
what
leads
things
off
oak
and
pepper
then
split
a
mild
mid
palate
flash
before
the
acidity
comes
in
for
the
finish
the
body
is
supremely
dry
and
the
carbonation
is
prickly
on
my
tongue
without
being
overly
fizzy
cantillon
classic
is
just
that
a
true
classic
and
im
interested
to
see
how
one
with
a
bit
less
age
on
it
compares
o
this
beer
is
pretty
darn
delicious
i
feel
like
you
really
have
to
be
in
the
mood
for
a
gueuze
to
enjoy
it
but
if
youre
going
to
pick
a
gueuze
to
drink
why
not
pick
a
this
cantillon
thanks
again
to
dave
and
blake
for
this
bottle
glad
i
have
one
more
in
the
cellar
o
this
is
not
my
style
just
to
damn
sour
i
just
cant
understand
that
some
people
love
this
stuff
overall
this
is
an
excellent
beer
and
something
i
will
always
enjoy
a
lot
of
great
flavors
and
very
easy
to
drink
dont
ever
pass
this
one
down
overall
a
real
treat
taste
is
funky
and
sour
but
still
very
drinkable
and
super
dry
on
the
finish
it
has
a
distinct
cantillon
funk
that
is
hard
to
explain
but
exceptionally
delicious
mouthfeel
is
light
and
crisp
overall
its
about
the
perfect
geueze
o
i
havent
gotten
into
to
much
gueze
wild
sour
territory
so
what
a
great
start
really
awesome
othe
standard
for
which
all
other
gueuzes
are
measured
a
beer
that
must
be
drank
with
a
clean
slate
and
an
open
mind
a
unique
and
interesting
beer
for
sure
o
excellent
beer
d
very
drinkable
little
on
the
higher
priced
side
for
regular
consumption
but
a
great
treat
and
an
awesome
introduction
into
gueuze
this
was
a
great
find
and
im
glad
to
finally
have
had
a
cantillon
beer
its
quite
delicate
and
super
drinkable
the
other
beers
from
this
brewery
will
be
a
treat
indeed
a
classic
brew
had
this
one
during
zwanze
day
2011
while
at
holy
grale
served
from
tap
into
a
cantillon
taster
flute
poured
a
slightly
hazy
golden
yellow
with
a
half
finger
pure
white
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
quickly
maintained
nice
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
funk
tart
fruit
wood
sour
apples
and
barnyard
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
funk
tart
fruit
wood
and
brett
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
high
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
solid
brew
i
have
had
this
brew
multiple
times
out
of
the
bottle
but
this
was
the
only
chance
ive
had
to
have
it
on
tap
i
have
to
be
honest
this
one
actually
tasted
better
out
of
the
bottle
to
me
as
the
funk
really
carried
through
more
out
of
them
this
was
still
quite
good
in
aspects
of
the
way
i
would
love
to
have
a
keg
or
three
of
this
sitting
around
my
house
either
way
a
definite
must
experience
serving
method
for
this
one
now
if
only
i
can
find
it
on
cask
this
beer
pours
a
golden
yellow
with
the
slightest
of
orange
hues
to
it
the
pour
produced
a
nice
one
finger
white
head
that
lasted
a
fair
amount
of
time
the
smell
is
slightly
barnyard
but
not
overwhelming
there
are
hints
of
lemon
and
fruit
that
i
cannot
quite
put
my
finger
on
there
is
also
a
nice
tartness
to
the
nose
the
flavor
is
wonderful
with
the
funk
and
a
hint
of
oak
up
front
followed
by
the
nice
tartness
in
the
finish
this
beer
is
well
carbonated
and
has
a
nice
light
mouthfeel
to
it
overall
i
would
have
to
say
that
this
is
a
very
good
gueuze
but
i
think
cantillon
produces
better
fruited
lambics
i
could
go
on
for
days
about
this
thing
and
i
mean
thing
literally
but
i
do
know
that
its
complex
funky
full
bodied
and
fantastic
purchase
on
sight
with
no
questions
asked
i
love
this
beer
so
so
so
delicious
if
i
could
drink
it
nightly
i
would
o
really
great
beer
so
glad
i
let
this
sit
for
a
couple
years
i
think
i
mellowed
it
quite
a
bit
highly
recommended
skal
o
this
has
great
drinkability
it
is
an
awesome
tasting
beer
and
i
could
drink
it
all
night
long
this
is
a
really
good
example
of
the
style
and
i
would
definitely
pick
up
some
more
of
this
i
highly
recommend
trying
it
o
this
one
is
remarkable
a
true
bench
mark
for
all
other
gueuzes
on
the
market
overall
impression
it
took
me
over
600
beers
to
find
but
i
found
it
the
perfect
5
out
of
5
beer
it
could
be
a
10
out
of
10
too
if
you
put
it
on
an
even
tougher
scale
if
you
get
a
chance
get
your
hands
on
this
and
let
it
age
im
going
to
be
searching
far
and
wide
for
this
and
wouldnt
mind
buying
2
or
3
to
enjoy
once
again
and
then
age
the
other
two
not
one
category
in
this
had
any
flaws
how
could
this
be
really
appreciated
the
lemon
flavors
and
how
real
this
one
was
highly
highly
recommended
dont
worry
about
the
price
on
this
one
it
will
be
worth
your
buck
d
its
not
as
complex
as
some
of
the
others
but
the
taste
is
quite
good
unabashed
and
refreshing
mouthfeel
o
a
great
sour
that
is
a
good
accompaniment
to
a
fine
dining
experience
o
simply
superb
o
i
love
everything
cantillon
does
and
this
is
no
exception
this
is
the
gueuze
every
other
gueuzes
should
be
compared
this
is
damn
near
perfect
o
great
lambic
beer
not
too
sour
in
its
finish
its
tart
through
the
whole
experience
but
it
gets
pushed
through
the
mouth
pretty
rapidly
due
to
the
high
carbonation
so
it
doesnt
linger
very
very
well
done
wild
sour
need
to
find
some
more
cantillon
beers
this
was
fun
to
drink
incredibly
drinkable
i
could
drink
this
all
day
if
only
i
had
good
alcohol
tolerance
damn
my
asian
genes
prefer
this
to
hanssens
geueze
although
i
would
love
to
drink
both
this
was
one
of
the
european
bottles
with
the
blue
and
white
labels
light
gold
into
the
cantillon
tulip
aroma
is
musky
dank
like
a
sweaty
horse
a
lemon
tree
and
a
summer
field
the
flavor
is
sharp
and
sour
lemon
peel
and
dirt
from
a
farm
i
love
that
horse
sweat
part
of
it
thats
much
stronger
than
in
other
traditional
gueuze
very
well
done
gueuze
crisp
and
light
but
very
complex
one
of
the
better
cantillon
offerings
and
much
preferable
to
drie
fontienen
or
girardin
to
my
taste
drinkability
and
overall
impression
as
with
earlier
examples
of
this
style
im
finding
cantillons
gueuze
very
drinkable
as
each
sip
fades
im
ready
to
take
another
to
see
how
well
balanced
and
complex
the
mix
of
flavors
is
my
overall
impression
is
that
the
reputation
of
this
beer
the
brewery
and
the
head
brewer
is
well
deserved
as
ive
gained
more
experience
with
the
style
ive
grown
to
understand
just
what
a
treasure
cantillon
beers
can
be
nice
to
know
ive
got
some
of
this
that
i
can
hold
onto
for
a
while
so
as
to
taste
and
smell
the
changes
that
take
place
with
bottle
age
i
very
much
enjoyed
this
beer
and
will
have
it
again
o
i
had
no
idea
what
to
expect
from
this
beer
and
it
was
very
enjoyable
the
unique
flavor
achieved
creates
a
crisp
refreshing
that
is
perfect
any
time
of
year
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
gueuze
sour
and
funky
in
a
nice
balance
definetely
the
best
ive
had
not
that
ive
had
many
of
these
much
more
than
just
a
sour
apple
jolly
rancher
dissolving
in
red
wine
vinegar
like
the
jacobins
rouge
i
had
a
lot
going
on
in
the
one
i
had
the
taste
is
dry
and
sour
to
start
very
sour
it
becomes
fruity
like
fresh
apples
and
finishes
with
more
of
a
cider
sour
apple
taste
pours
a
hazy
golden
orange
almost
no
head
smells
earthy
and
funky
lots
of
armhouse
dirtiness
tastes
sweet
and
tast
not
overly
sour
but
definitely
funky
overall
well
carbonated
but
isnt
quite
doing
it
for
me
perhaps
im
not
a
gueuze
person
pleasant
barnyard
with
hints
of
fruit
on
the
nose
and
a
very
tart
flavor
with
funk
in
the
background
a
gueuze
with
wonderul
contrast
between
the
nose
and
taste
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
on
tap
750
ml
capped
and
corked
bottle
the
cork
says
this
was
bottled
in
2010
the
bottling
date
on
the
bottle
is
smudged
but
it
looks
like
it
says
17
march
2010
served
in
a
flute
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
gold
color
with
a
half
inch
offwhite
head
head
retention
is
decent
not
much
lacing
aroma
is
very
nice
its
tart
and
musty
the
brew
smells
like
funk
tart
apples
lemon
peel
and
some
hay
for
the
most
part
the
taste
is
just
like
the
aroma
but
theres
also
some
white
grape
and
oak
flavors
noticable
too
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
with
moderate
carbonation
its
also
dry
and
very
easy
to
drink
i
think
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
and
would
buy
it
again
the
next
time
i
come
across
it
at
13
99
a
bottle
its
definitely
worth
the
money
ogood
beer
cant
wait
to
see
what
this
does
with
age
the
feel
is
light
and
crisp
overall
this
one
is
the
bar
for
the
style
in
my
opinion
this
is
a
very
good
gueuze
the
balance
is
great
making
this
a
very
pleasant
even
refreshing
drink
lots
of
complexity
paired
with
nice
balance
d
overall
this
is
a
musthave
for
anyone
looking
to
try
a
good
gueuze
bright
refreshing
and
complex
at
the
same
time
its
a
good
gueuze
but
as
my
first
cantillon
experience
im
a
bit
let
down
the
body
is
a
bit
lacking
as
is
the
flavor
profile
recommend
drie
fonteinen
any
day
over
this
o
nice
underlying
beer
but
i
prefer
the
funksour
balance
of
other
geuzes
overall
good
sour
beer
no
fruit
flavors
or
other
additives
o
the
best
beer
ive
ever
had
from
the
1990s
this
was
just
so
impressive
i
was
in
awe
a
wellrespected
ba
at
this
tasting
said
this
one
reminded
him
of
loerik
which
i
havent
had
this
just
shows
how
excellent
loerik
is
outstanding
drink
a
long
time
want
of
mine
was
very
happy
to
finally
be
able
to
have
this
one
overall
mmmm
good
way
to
end
things
here
you
can
tell
that
there
probably
was
some
more
fermentation
that
could
have
happened
in
the
bottle
from
the
youngest
added
lambic
but
still
delicious
d
a
lovely
well
rounded
gueze
cantillon
hits
the
mark
with
barnyard
notes
more
than
others
imho
a
definitive
version
of
the
style
a
classic
just
about
perfect
great
beer
bottle
gold
pour
with
white
foam
strong
lambic
funkiness
immediately
finds
its
way
to
my
nose
as
im
pouring
aroma
has
strong
notes
of
wet
hay
leather
brett
classic
farmyard
gueuze
funk
and
cheesy
aromas
from
the
aged
hops
taste
is
very
sour
no
sweetness
really
some
old
hop
flavors
but
mostly
sharp
palate
is
what
makes
these
beers
a
wonderful
experience
for
me
highly
carbonated
and
dry
it
is
super
refreshing
a
great
classic
pours
a
deep
golden
color
with
a
decent
fizzy
head
aroma
is
sour
as
expected
the
nose
of
this
fine
ale
is
a
little
funky
featuring
soured
lemon
barnyard
musty
basement
work
socks
in
the
taste
solid
sourness
lemon
oak
funk
very
champagnelike
only
with
a
puckering
sour
note
full
rounded
flavor
hits
every
sour
taste
bud
and
makes
them
beg
for
more
mouthfeel
is
dry
light
crisp
overall
a
fantastic
gueuze
pours
a
hazy
hefeweizen
orange
with
slight
sunset
crimson
tints
no
head
to
speqk
of
and
very
lightly
carbonated
2010
on
the
cork
the
nose
carries
overipe
melon
bright
acidic
citrus
barnyard
funk
a
touch
of
rancio
wraps
up
the
nose
the
taste
nd
mouthfeel
is
pure
mputhpuckering
sour
with
sour
patch
kids
bringing
a
slight
sweetness
citric
acid
along
with
a
dash
of
red
fruit
and
almost
a
wild
feral
quality
to
the
beer
light
in
abv
and
carbonation
ate
it
with
spicy
food
that
was
a
poor
match
leading
to
terrible
heartburn
a
very
good
sour
unfortunately
my
palate
just
does
not
understqnd
them
yet
poured
at
something
like
50
degrees
it
wasnt
as
wild
as
it
might
have
been
at
room
temperature
that
said
i
like
my
beer
even
gueuzes
a
little
bit
chilled
and
the
sourness
was
right
where
i
wanted
it
had
on
a
hot
summers
night
this
beer
had
a
reallly
refreshing
fullbodied
farmhouse
funk
just
perfect
for
the
conditions
this
is
my
new
gueuze
to
beat
cant
wait
to
find
it
again
o
amazing
balance
very
drinkable
and
smooth
this
isnt
something
i
normally
order
but
since
jen
at
the
trapp
door
drove
all
over
for
it
i
figured
i
would
give
it
a
try
this
beer
has
a
good
amount
of
pressure
in
the
bottle
right
after
the
cap
was
removed
the
cork
started
coming
out
on
it
own
with
a
little
help
of
a
cork
screw
it
was
poured
into
a
wine
glass
it
had
a
bubbly
golden
color
to
it
very
clean
and
clear
looking
the
smell
was
vibrant
with
funk
aromas
that
i
could
smell
before
it
was
even
placed
in
front
of
me
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
nice
and
tart
with
some
funky
flavors
going
on
the
mouthfeel
was
also
pretty
nice
very
drinkable
overall
i
found
it
to
only
be
harsh
on
the
first
sip
after
that
it
got
much
better
and
easier
to
drink
good
stuff
for
sure
o
5
abv
seriously
i
could
drink
this
all
day
and
night
i
polished
off
the
750ml
with
no
problem
whatsoever
that
it
was
aged
from
november
2008
probably
only
added
to
the
beauty
and
complexity
of
this
beer
stunning
cheers
overall
i
am
very
pleased
with
this
one
i
was
expecting
a
little
more
complexity
in
to
come
through
but
the
simplicity
doesnt
take
anything
away
from
the
brew
its
fantastic
and
leaves
me
wanting
more
cantillon
o
overall
another
good
one
from
cantillon
one
of
the
best
breweries
out
there
o
dont
feel
its
the
best
execution
of
the
style
and
there
was
more
vinegar
than
id
like
but
its
still
very
refreshing
to
drink
and
everything
that
it
offers
comes
in
top
quality
form
o
very
good
for
style
and
very
easy
to
drink
o
this
just
surpassed
drie
fonteinen
oude
as
my
favorite
gueze
this
is
such
a
well
crafted
beer
that
was
worth
the
wait
poured
into
my
bruery
tulip
pours
golden
with
a
foamy
1
finger
head
that
stays
aroma
of
brett
lemon
and
a
little
funk
in
the
back
taste
is
tart
cidery
lil
funky
and
delicious
mouthfeel
is
smooth
with
medium
carbonation
very
drinkable
overall
this
is
amazing
great
sour
flavor
with
high
drinkability
o
one
of
the
best
i
have
ever
tried
definitely
worth
trying
and
i
continue
to
drink
this
whenever
i
can
find
it
damn
well
brewed
o
really
interesting
bottle
this
go
round
a
lot
more
sour
than
previous
tastings
which
im
enjoying
a
great
deal
when
i
think
of
cantillon
classic
gueuze
i
think
more
delicate
refined
tartness
and
exceptional
complexity
but
i
love
any
iteration
of
this
beer
cheers
d
i
could
drink
this
all
night
and
day
2010
vintage
pours
very
bright
with
a
nice
lasting
head
smell
of
the
classic
cantillon
aroma
but
more
subdued
funk
citrus
aromas
of
grapefruit
and
apples
great
mouthfeel
not
super
acidic
more
on
the
balanced
side
with
the
sweetness
i
could
drink
liters
of
this
stuff
this
is
the
best
geuze
i
have
had
the
funky
sour
and
crisp
refreshing
notes
are
in
perfect
harmony
a
good
beer
for
a
hot
afternoon
o
solid
quality
gueuze
im
just
expanding
into
the
sour
category
and
i
was
not
disappointed
with
this
beer
very
funky
and
sour
as
well
as
refreshing
o
its
called
classic
for
a
reason
and
its
one
that
neer
lets
me
down
jean
can
blend
a
damn
gueuze
cant
he
i
love
it
what
else
can
i
say
overall
an
excellent
beer
cant
wait
to
try
the
other
cantillon
offerings
that
i
have
sitting
in
my
cellar
the
aroma
was
strong
pungent
and
very
sour
ahh
the
lovely
aroma
of
brett
in
full
force
here
pungent
aromas
of
grapes
just
all
over
this
one
a
nice
fruity
vibe
as
it
warms
with
hints
of
peaches
and
apples
light
fruit
in
general
were
all
lying
deep
underneath
however
the
real
story
was
the
gorgeous
amounts
of
sour
notes
that
were
all
over
this
one
really
quite
beautiful
the
flavor
followed
along
perfectly
with
a
light
airy
body
this
was
an
ideal
beer
for
the
evening
lots
of
carbonation
and
an
increasingly
complex
profile
just
really
lit
it
up
there
was
the
undeniable
taste
of
bret
rippling
through
it
providing
me
with
the
great
sour
taste
but
below
that
lots
of
peach
and
pear
flavors
were
increasingly
poking
their
heads
around
letting
you
know
there
were
there
as
well
a
nice
light
grain
flavor
made
up
the
base
and
kept
things
from
getting
out
of
control
there
was
an
nicel
ong
drawn
out
finish
that
really
tightened
things
up
nicely
and
left
a
good
fresh
grass
and
sour
grape
flavor
in
your
mouth
for
a
good
long
time
the
drinkability
on
this
one
was
superb
with
a
deep
flavor
profile
that
was
just
light
enough
to
be
enjoyed
all
night
overall
this
is
one
of
the
best
geuzes
out
there
i
definitely
have
trouble
describing
the
geuzes
but
i
can
tell
you
this
one
is
delicious
finish
explosive
complex
and
surprising
it
ends
a
bit
dry
but
with
plenty
of
flavor
an
amzing
beer
d
for
a
gueuze
very
very
drinkable
with
each
sip
i
couldnt
wait
for
the
next
one
it
was
so
refreshing
and
just
damn
tasty
i
will
seek
this
one
out
again
overall
this
is
quite
the
treat
and
im
so
glad
to
finally
have
opened
my
bottle
the
cantillon
tumbler
makes
it
even
more
of
an
experience
and
i
cant
wait
to
enjoy
more
cantillons
with
it
2006
cork
date
so
i
guess
its
a
2004
bottle
yellow
and
black
label
with
the
drunk
guy
on
the
chair
drinking
this
right
after
a
2009
drie
fonteinen
oude
geuze
pours
a
mostly
clear
apricot
orange
sort
of
color
with
a
medium
head
less
spritzy
and
a
touch
darker
than
the
fonteinen
nose
is
immediately
more
sharp
and
less
minerally
than
the
fonteinen
more
lemon
more
funk
somehow
chewier
in
the
nose
as
weird
as
it
sounds
flavor
is
massively
funky
urine
manure
mushroom
way
more
flavors
going
on
than
the
fonteinen
not
all
of
them
pleasant
despite
all
the
crazy
funky
oddities
of
this
it
works
pretty
freakin
well
on
the
opposite
end
of
the
flavor
spectrum
from
the
fonteinen
cantillon
is
way
more
earth
fungus
digestive
like
while
fonteinen
is
toward
the
champagne
mineral
lemon
end
of
the
spectrum
the
fonteinen
is
actually
more
dry
in
my
opinion
both
fantastic
as
this
one
opens
its
sublime
375
bottle
2009
release
poured
a
light
clear
yellowish
golden
color
while
there
definitley
was
carbonation
there
was
very
little
head
on
this
one
aromas
of
musty
grapes
barnyard
citrus
grass
and
so
much
of
the
great
cantillon
sour
on
the
palate
tons
of
acid
and
funk
with
flavors
of
citrus
grapes
and
yeast
extremely
tart
sour
and
funky
on
every
sip
this
is
truly
classic
gueuze
and
near
the
top
of
my
list
for
best
gueuze
i
wish
i
had
gotten
another
matching
bottle
to
compare
to
in
a
years
time
this
was
fantastic
o
this
lambic
is
a
killer
notes
flavors
are
smooth
and
sharp
and
lacking
anything
off
complex
o
what
else
is
there
to
say
about
this
world
class
beer
so
complex
and
delicious
i
could
drink
this
all
day
to
my
surprise
my
dad
loved
it
looks
like
cantillon
has
another
fan
now
this
is
a
delicious
beer
like
nothing
ive
ever
tasted
before
very
crisp
very
dry
and
sour
but
without
any
mouthpuckering
or
sharp
notes
it
has
some
characteristics
quite
similar
to
a
mediumdry
white
wine
look
forward
to
drinking
it
again
its
a
good
gueuze
i
feel
like
it
has
the
classic
cantillon
acidic
intensity
that
drowns
out
the
other
characters
but
this
one
is
tempered
more
than
most
giving
the
nice
funky
basis
nice
skål
pours
a
deep
honey
orange
color
with
a
1
inch
white
head
that
fades
to
a
film
on
the
top
of
the
beer
small
chunks
of
lacing
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
a
very
tart
and
sour
vinegar
smell
apple
peels
and
funkmust
the
first
sip
of
this
beer
gave
me
a
mouth
puckering
chill
sour
vinegar
tart
lemon
apple
skins
and
musty
and
funky
earthiness
this
beer
says
it
was
aged
in
oak
barrels
but
i
dont
get
any
woody
aspects
whatsoever
very
light
but
pronounced
carbonation
make
for
a
clean
and
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
very
good
gueuze
and
my
beer
ever
from
cantillon
this
is
the
first
bottle
of
cantillon
i
have
ever
seen
in
the
los
angeles
area
and
the
last
bottle
in
the
store
i
didnt
think
twice
about
snatching
it
up
and
i
am
very
glad
i
didnt
a
very
tasty
beer
indeed
it
was
pale
golden
sour
and
dry
definitely
more
like
wine
than
what
you
would
expect
from
a
typical
beer
incredibly
complex
vinous
sour
apple
funk
softer
and
more
complex
than
you
would
expect
wonderfully
strange
to
someone
used
to
regular
beers
o
ive
not
had
many
gueuzes
but
this
is
the
best
so
far
complex
and
smooth
with
just
the
right
amount
of
sourness
its
likely
because
this
is
a
new
bottle
but
i
was
expecting
it
to
be
more
complex
it
doesnt
taste
much
different
from
other
gueuzes
ive
had
i
guess
i
should
have
bought
another
one
to
age
750ml
bottle
from
rayl101
pours
hazy
golden
color
with
white
head
good
carbonation
aroma
is
funk
cobwebs
green
apple
and
some
light
berries
taste
is
sour
with
a
little
funkiness
and
some
vinegar
thin
bodied
with
a
slick
mouthfeel
finish
is
quite
dry
yet
its
quenching
a
very
solid
beer
that
is
easy
to
drink
especially
on
a
warm
day
as
it
is
here
now
theres
no
doubting
this
yearround
cantillon
offering
is
a
good
beer
and
a
solid
gueuze
though
i
cant
help
but
feel
a
bit
let
down
the
flavors
are
nice
but
their
lack
in
diversity
or
something
to
just
make
it
stand
out
is
an
upset
cork
showed
early
signed
of
blue
mold
not
the
first
time
from
cantillon
d
the
drinkability
was
fabulous
and
like
the
label
says
this
is
a
classic
gueuze
which
i
can
drink
all
day
unfortunately
i
was
pressed
for
time
and
overzealous
about
this
beer
and
drank
this
too
quickly
try
and
have
some
restraint
this
beer
can
only
benefit
from
it
she
waited
upwards
of
3
years
for
you
you
can
wait
a
few
minutes
for
her
the
seduction
is
all
the
more
inviting
for
your
patience
lighter
spritzy
body
dry
and
lingering
on
the
palate
but
inherently
refreshing
pleasant
throughout
super
tasty
delicious
mesh
of
scent
and
taste
from
top
to
bottom
another
bullseye
from
cantillon
o
so
thankful
to
have
gotten
this
this
is
one
of
the
best
gueuze
ive
had
and
leads
me
to
believe
the
vintages
have
got
to
be
totally
bangin
i
have
another
one
thats
gonna
be
sittin
in
my
cellar
fridge
for
a
lot
longer
than
i
was
planning
this
is
an
exceptional
beer
this
is
indeed
a
classic
gueuze
easy
to
drink
but
funky
and
sour
enough
to
always
make
everything
interesting
a
great
effort
overall
this
is
my
favorite
gueze
to
date
unbelievable
well
balanced
and
perfectly
tart
manages
to
tow
the
line
between
being
refreshing
and
complex
incredibly
well
i
will
definitely
be
seeking
this
out
again
wont
you
take
me
to
funky
town
gotta
love
the
gueze
100
lambic
aged
in
oak
barrels
aroma
is
pretty
mild
yet
so
so
pleasant
and
full
of
anticipation
taste
is
very
tart
and
acidic
green
apple
tartness
on
the
cheeks
im
going
to
stop
the
train
sit
down
on
the
tracks
and
drink
this
all
day
long
dvery
refreshing
and
a
very
nice
example
of
gueuze
i
would
love
to
try
this
again
if
it
only
were
a
little
bit
more
reasonable
in
terms
of
price
o
one
of
the
best
brewery
flagship
beers
on
the
market
what
is
not
to
like
about
this
beer
if
you
want
a
fantastic
lambic
look
no
further
mouthfeel
is
a
fantastic
meld
of
crisp
smooth
lightness
and
puckering
sour
acidity
the
two
go
together
very
well
and
the
carbonation
is
a
fantastic
sidekick
to
the
tartness
adding
a
lively
nature
drinkability
is
phenomenal
for
how
strong
the
flavors
are
the
enameldestroying
acidity
in
the
mouthfeel
hinders
the
ability
drink
large
quantities
of
this
at
one
time
but
i
had
no
problem
putting
down
a
bomber
of
this
in
about
a
half
hour
my
first
taste
of
cantillon
will
not
be
forgotten
and
i
now
understand
the
fever
people
have
for
this
brewery
overall
a
top
notch
gueze
for
all
i
know
the
best
of
the
best
im
very
glad
i
got
the
oppertunity
to
try
this
beer
as
with
any
cantillon
they
are
truly
artists
of
there
craft
highly
recommended
this
is
pretty
straightforward
and
fun
drinking
this
beer
could
pair
with
some
food
i
think
to
make
it
interesting
but
it
also
surprisingly
good
just
on
its
own
its
very
tolerable
and
goes
down
easy
like
nothing
d
this
is
not
for
the
unintiated
to
the
gueuze
style
its
delicious
nonetheless
low
in
abv
with
a
light
body
and
endless
complexity
making
it
a
constant
journey
of
taste
not
a
lot
of
words
to
be
said
about
this
one
but
thats
how
i
feel
with
most
gueuze
or
wild
beers
its
simple
and
clean
but
maintains
all
of
what
you
would
expect
a
very
nice
offering
taste
is
tart
grains
but
manages
to
be
ohso
soft
big
brettanomyces
presence
but
still
plays
second
fiddle
to
the
sourness
so
damn
delicious
i
could
drink
one
of
these
every
single
day
light
fruitiness
rubber
is
still
there
i
could
see
this
aging
with
the
best
of
em
pretty
complex
despite
leaning
heavily
towards
the
sour
end
of
the
spectrum
just
an
amazing
beer
cant
believe
i
havent
reviewed
this
before
ive
tried
it
in
just
about
all
its
incarnations
fresh
aged
etc
always
a
winner
this
review
is
for
a
freshie
2010
bottling
anyways
here
goes
beautiful
dark
golden
color
with
a
white
head
that
holds
better
than
most
of
its
counterparts
nose
is
mainly
citrusy
minerally
earthy
almost
grassy
sometimes
funky
and
woody
sounds
simple
but
there
really
is
a
lot
going
on
here
and
it
all
rings
out
in
masterful
harmony
just
divine
taste
is
round
and
creamy
with
a
shock
of
acid
that
amplifies
everything
very
citrusy
with
notes
of
cobweb
rushing
springtime
brook
wet
rock
fresh
grass
fruit
and
a
bit
of
spice
in
the
finish
with
a
touch
of
oak
mouthfeel
is
a
soft
and
light
medium
body
with
minimal
prickliness
and
bracing
acidity
truly
one
of
the
great
masterpieces
of
the
brewing
world
this
beer
is
full
of
soul
it
is
refreshing
lively
complex
and
contemplative
beautiful
always
a
joy
to
drink
d
one
of
the
best
sours
ive
had
to
date
a
great
beer
that
i
wouldnt
mind
having
again
d
very
good
and
highly
drinkable
d
really
had
to
restrain
myself
from
drinking
this
one
too
quickly
absolutely
nothing
stopping
it
from
going
down
looking
very
forward
to
the
next
time
i
have
a
chance
to
try
this
beer
bottle
cork
date
of
2009
so
this
is
a
really
young
one
cork
opens
with
a
nice
pop
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
a
clear
only
ever
so
slight
haze
apricot
orange
color
with
a
1
finger
lace
white
head
that
quickly
settles
to
form
a
slight
collar
around
teh
glass
the
aromatics
include
white
fruit
notes
like
pear
apple
and
grape
definitely
some
barnyard
funk
and
hay
carbonation
dances
on
the
tongue
with
a
light
mouthfeel
not
overly
sour
but
its
there
along
with
a
funky
floral
flavor
all
balanced
with
some
sweetness
and
a
slight
bitter
in
the
end
end
semidry
and
clean
for
the
price
and
availability
this
is
just
great
d
i
found
this
one
to
be
pretty
good
not
quite
sure
how
often
i
could
drink
this
one
but
wouldnt
turn
it
down
d
this
beer
is
absolute
in
its
drinkability
outstanding
light
on
the
tongue
with
tart
berry
notes
again
and
light
hints
of
vinegar
carbonation
lends
a
solid
distribution
on
the
tongue
and
provides
a
relatively
full
feel
for
the
light
abv
touch
of
sweetness
on
the
finish
balances
the
tartness
well
easy
drink
but
not
overwhelming
in
flavor
dept
being
quite
pleasant
though
a
bit
more
uniform
than
anticipated
this
is
my
second
favorite
regular
production
gueuze
in
the
world
drinkability
the
low
abv
makes
this
one
easy
to
consume
if
you
like
this
style
and
i
do
love
this
style
bring
me
more
because
i
cant
get
enough
too
good
to
pass
up
plus
you
know
its
good
when
it
has
a
cork
in
it
this
beer
was
my
very
first
gueze
so
i
must
admit
knowing
there
was
sour
gave
me
some
apprehension
in
drinking
this
the
appearance
is
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
coarse
white
foam
the
aromatics
were
a
touch
funky
with
a
smell
of
some
decent
skinned
pinot
noir
grapes
the
flavor
had
a
very
champagne
like
flavor
the
carbonation
wasnt
as
strong
but
the
grape
flavor
was
right
there
the
mild
tartness
worked
interestingly
with
the
grapes
there
was
a
salty
background
to
the
taste
it
was
pretty
easy
to
drink
once
i
got
used
to
the
flavor
a
good
gueze
now
i
need
to
figure
out
why
the
top
tier
ones
are
so
sought
after
that
guy
on
the
labels
gonna
have
a
bad
time
real
soon
meanwhile
his
beer
pours
a
lightly
hazy
straw
topped
by
a
solid
finger
of
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
lemon
wedge
coriander
sour
wheat
white
grapes
brett
and
some
nice
funky
funk
word
the
taste
really
emphasizes
those
sour
notes
particularly
lemon
orange
peel
and
brett
its
all
pretty
tart
but
nothing
oerwhelmingly
so
the
body
is
a
heftyfeeling
light
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
dry
rather
sticky
finish
overall
a
very
nice
gueuze
though
not
really
something
i
can
see
drinking
too
heavily
during
a
day
the
cpj
drinkability
gueuze
is
certainly
an
interesting
and
unique
style
i
have
a
hard
time
with
some
of
these
unique
belgian
styles
comparing
them
to
anything
other
than
champagne
all
in
all
thats
what
really
describes
this
beer
sour
citrusy
champagne
its
definitely
good
and
definitely
worth
a
shot
but
dont
expect
beerbeer
when
you
drink
it
i
must
admit
it
is
a
well
crafted
brew
of
course
marked
down
a
little
on
drinkability
only
for
my
inexperience
i
wouldnt
be
able
to
drink
this
often
but
it
will
be
a
rare
treat
the
thing
about
a
good
gueuze
is
that
its
both
uncomplicated
and
super
complex
at
the
same
time
layers
of
earth
funk
and
downright
sour
goodness
sticky
good
carbonation
nice
lacing
and
just
writing
about
it
is
making
my
mouth
water
all
over
again
cant
wait
to
get
my
hands
on
more
i
have
to
admit
that
i
have
just
become
interested
in
sour
beers
in
the
last
year
or
so
from
what
ive
had
classic
gueuze
is
definitely
a
toptier
lambic
there
is
really
nothing
negative
i
can
say
about
this
beer
edit
wow
had
it
on
tap
pure
awesomeness
just
like
the
bottle
opinion
all
i
really
can
say
is
wow
gueuze
is
my
favorite
style
but
i
would
have
to
say
that
this
is
probably
my
second
favorite
one
i
would
still
take
a
girardin
1882
black
label
gueuze
over
this
one
but
i
am
just
splitting
hairs
to
do
so
this
is
a
more
true
representation
of
the
style
imo
this
beer
is
so
wild
that
you
are
forced
to
drink
it
slowly
which
is
not
a
bad
thing
i
prefer
to
regulate
myself
not
be
regulated
by
a
beer
but
this
beer
is
worth
it
girardin
is
a
bit
more
approachable
upfront
but
i
am
really
enjoying
the
allout
onslaught
to
the
senses
that
you
get
with
this
beer
i
would
have
to
say
that
if
you
can
afford
it
and
can
take
it
drink
this
as
regularly
as
you
possibly
can
these
beers
are
a
beautiful
slice
of
history
and
you
can
only
keep
them
around
by
buying
their
products
and
making
sure
the
bills
are
paid
at
the
ole
brasserie
i
am
not
trying
to
give
a
lesson
in
the
economy
of
beer
but
this
beer
and
the
legacy
that
goes
with
it
is
that
good
tasty
complex
balanced
gueuze
very
nice
stuff
dreally
one
of
my
favorite
gueuzes
available
and
is
tastier
everytime
i
have
some
d
usually
its
tough
for
me
to
finish
a
gueze
by
myself
the
acid
just
gets
to
be
too
much
thats
not
the
case
here
this
is
a
wonderful
treat
i
cant
wait
to
try
some
with
a
bit
more
age
on
it
drinkability
this
particular
gueuze
was
not
overly
funky
and
quite
refreshing
i
could
drink
several
of
these
in
a
sitting
no
problem
the
only
draw
back
is
price
but
you
only
live
once
so
what
the
hell
great
beer
but
i
personally
enjoy
it
with
more
age
after
23
years
in
bottle
it
really
hits
its
stride
d
for
a
gueuze
very
very
drinkable
with
each
sip
i
couldnt
wait
for
the
next
one
it
was
so
refreshing
and
just
damn
tasty
d
nice
and
easy
drinking
had
this
on
tap
but
the
bottle
was
just
as
good
great
beer
the
sour
character
gets
a
little
overbearing
as
i
go
the
tiny
glass
i
had
is
definitely
enough
pours
a
light
golden
color
with
a
quickly
dissipating
effervescent
white
head
some
nice
lacing
and
beautiful
bubbles
in
the
glass
smells
warm
yeasty
and
musty
sour
citrusy
acidic
flavor
with
a
very
champagne
like
mouth
feel
this
is
the
first
gueuze
ive
had
and
i
really
enjoy
it
d
one
of
the
best
brews
i
have
had
in
a
while
i
have
been
on
a
hops
hiatus
and
the
sour
world
has
been
a
pleasant
surprise
only
the
second
gueuze
ive
ever
tried
but
im
hooked
i
would
like
to
try
some
more
cantillon
offerings
if
only
they
werent
so
hard
to
find
d
the
sour
flavors
are
strong
but
do
not
completely
overpower
the
taste
and
make
this
an
interesting
beer
to
sip
its
relatively
easy
to
drink
for
the
style
this
beer
is
very
tart
so
you
can
either
just
drink
it
down
like
a
child
getting
into
his
halloween
candy
or
you
can
sit
and
sip
it
because
its
over
powering
thats
the
two
options
here
i
fall
to
the
latter
category
its
sort
of
frothy
and
kind
of
thick
which
is
good
if
this
had
a
thin
body
i
would
be
severely
disappointed
with
the
experience
having
a
strong
enough
body
to
carry
this
bold
tart
flavor
is
key
to
making
this
a
successful
beer
jesus
d
great
i
would
pair
this
with
any
dinner
or
even
cook
with
it
to
extract
all
the
flavor
finally
got
to
try
this
beer
once
popping
the
cork
i
got
a
nice
whiff
of
delicious
barnyard
funk
appearance
is
cloudy
golden
with
small
white
head
scent
is
a
lot
of
lemon
with
amazing
sour
fragrances
a
bit
of
floral
notes
as
well
with
some
great
funk
and
oak
taste
is
amazingly
sour
which
i
love
initially
i
get
tartness
with
great
oak
flavors
quickly
followed
by
mouthpuckering
sourness
then
i
just
get
some
great
flavors
or
bread
flowers
and
other
citrus
notes
a
little
bit
of
bitterness
at
the
end
with
more
oak
delicious
beer
mouthfeel
is
almost
perfect
very
full
bodied
and
crisp
mouthpuckering
sour
queuze
drinkability
is
very
high
for
me
as
long
as
i
can
find
it
somewhere
and
my
stomach
can
handle
the
amazing
acidic
features
of
this
worldclass
brew
drinkability
quite
so
a
very
easy
to
drink
gueuze
and
i
cant
wait
to
have
some
more
glad
i
have
some
in
the
cellar
a
very
easy
to
drink
geuze
and
a
good
option
to
introduce
people
to
this
style
who
may
not
have
tried
it
before
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
very
refreshing
nice
carbonation
makes
for
a
relatively
crisp
feeling
this
is
highly
drinkable
for
those
who
love
the
style
poured
from
2009
375ml
bottle
into
cantillon
long
stem
glass
color
is
a
clear
golden
with
a
small
white
head
that
fades
to
a
collar
smell
is
very
typical
cantillon
lots
of
funk
lemons
and
bright
citrus
pineapple
one
of
the
fruitier
smelling
lambics
i
have
had
taste
is
sour
and
acidic
up
front
but
as
the
initial
harsh
flavors
subside
there
is
a
lot
of
fresh
lemon
and
tropical
fruit
slightly
metallic
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
body
with
a
light
but
active
carbonation
and
a
dry
finish
an
excellent
gueuze
one
of
the
best
around
i
am
rarely
disappointed
with
any
cantillon
beers
probably
the
most
smooth
and
drinkable
of
the
style
i
have
had
to
date
the
subtle
oak
really
rounds
out
this
delicious
gueuze
drinkability
a
very
tasty
and
intensely
sour
brew
cantillon
has
yet
to
produce
a
disappointing
brew
and
this
is
another
fine
example
of
a
well
done
beer
i
wish
i
had
more
than
one
in
my
cellar
guess
i
need
to
make
a
beer
run
after
the
holidays
pours
a
hazy
light
amber
color
with
a
thick
white
fizzy
head
and
no
real
lacing
to
mention
smells
of
wet
hay
musk
some
apple
and
funk
tastes
a
bit
funky
with
some
apple
plenty
of
sourness
and
lots
of
lemon
depth
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
a
carbonation
that
is
just
right
drinkability
is
high
i
knew
the
second
i
corked
this
beer
that
it
was
something
special
the
smell
was
yeast
and
bitter
apple
reminded
me
a
of
a
good
champaign
the
color
was
beautiful
golden
honey
first
drink
threw
me
off
a
bit
but
after
that
is
was
heavenly
its
unique
well
balanced
bitter
sweet
absolutely
an
amazing
beer
pours
honey
to
light
amber
color
puffy
white
head
with
dense
bubbles
and
fair
lacing
aroma
of
lemon
straw
and
lots
of
wet
hay
nice
typical
geuze
smell
taste
is
peppery
and
lemon
up
front
nice
sharp
dry
and
tart
middle
sour
faint
oak
notes
through
the
front
and
middle
the
bretty
and
hay
aroma
present
in
the
nose
is
muted
slightly
in
the
flavor
profile
super
clean
ending
mouthfeel
is
slightly
chamgane
like
really
drinkable
and
pleasant
d
this
is
a
very
good
sour
beer
i
really
think
it
is
one
of
the
best
that
ive
had
yet
all
in
all
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
ive
opened
3
bottles
in
the
last
month
and
everyone
that
has
tasted
them
had
good
things
to
say
these
bottles
were
a
lot
more
tart
and
dry
than
more
recent
examples
i
have
tried
i
was
honestly
blown
away
very
good
stuff
drinkability
definitely
gets
better
when
brought
closer
to
room
temperature
would
not
want
to
drink
more
than
a
bottle
at
a
time
but
that
can
be
a
good
thing
with
beers
this
complex
mouthfeel
is
thin
just
about
one
step
lower
than
a
champagne
with
lesser
carbonation
ill
gladly
drink
another
bottle
of
this
not
cause
its
cantillon
but
its
incredibly
refreshing
and
delicious
definitely
would
recommend
this
to
someone
trying
to
foray
themselves
into
the
sour
territory
thin
in
body
and
moderately
carbonated
this
drinks
fast
an
extremely
high
attenuation
allow
this
to
finish
nice
and
dry
very
quickly
the
glass
disappears
and
im
hearing
cries
from
the
other
bottle
i
have
in
my
possession
calling
to
me
im
hoping
to
let
it
fester
until
the
2
year
mark
but
oh
boy
its
going
to
be
tough
definitely
seek
this
guy
out
drinkablility
this
is
a
great
drink
this
is
absolutely
wonderful
i
will
admit
that
after
reading
the
reviews
i
was
a
bit
worried
this
would
be
too
sour
but
this
was
not
the
case
i
found
it
to
be
very
refreshing
and
enjoyable
for
my
first
gueuze
d
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
is
amazing
and
probably
its
best
trait
the
fact
that
it
is
only
5
abv
makes
it
very
easy
to
drink
while
it
is
very
sour
and
tart
it
is
not
insanely
lip
pucking
like
some
others
which
also
helps
the
drinkability
and
makes
finishing
a
bottle
alone
easy
i
also
loved
the
smell
would
definitely
buy
this
one
again
t
very
sour
and
slightly
fruity
some
citrus
very
very
dry
and
slightly
astringent
finishes
with
raw
apple
and
white
grape
notes
as
well
as
some
earth
and
must
vinous
m
light
and
clean
with
more
carbonation
than
i
initially
would
have
thought
d
this
is
a
very
tart
beer
that
was
my
first
true
sour
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
very
bold
flavors
that
eventually
destroy
your
palette
although
i
couldnt
have
more
than
a
350ml
bottle
i
really
enjoyed
it
throughout
overall
for
my
first
gueuze
this
went
very
well
maybe
to
well
first
of
all
these
beers
are
expensive
and
i
think
i
am
in
love
second
this
went
down
incredibly
quick
i
need
to
teach
myself
to
slow
down
and
really
enjoy
this
drinkability
is
a
little
lower
maybe
not
for
the
style
but
at
the
end
of
the
bottle
i
was
struggling
a
little
from
all
the
sourness
this
is
very
interesting
it
is
very
tart
and
flavorful
it
is
also
very
acidic
md
light
body
with
an
ultra
sour
finish
the
intensity
of
the
sourness
makes
it
a
definite
sipper
but
complex
enough
to
come
back
for
another
drink
always
a
pleasure
to
enjoy
such
an
exotic
out
there
beer
style
the
taste
is
a
little
young
mouthfeel
is
a
little
viscous
for
the
style
strong
lactic
sourness
clenches
the
jaw
on
the
first
sip
the
front
of
my
tongue
feels
numb
for
a
second
after
a
few
more
sips
bleu
cheese
leather
and
a
little
woody
flavor
is
present
the
lactic
acid
plays
off
the
brett
exceptionally
well
if
anything
too
well
this
gueuze
is
drinkably
offensive
lively
carbonation
lifts
this
beer
off
the
palate
leaving
a
lingering
sourness
this
isnt
as
quite
as
dry
as
id
like
it
to
be
yet
i
still
think
the
brett
has
to
eat
through
some
more
residual
sugars
the
beer
sweetens
as
it
warms
and
the
palate
gets
fatigued
all
in
all
a
good
gueuze
not
my
favorite
as
it
is
very
traditional
somewhat
plain
a
good
jumping
off
point
for
sours
i
suppose
d
next
time
i
buy
a
big
bottle
i
will
find
someone
to
split
it
with
because
it
was
overwhelming
having
a
big
bottle
in
my
first
tasting
i
really
did
enjoy
this
and
felt
that
it
opened
a
door
to
styles
i
have
not
tried
yet
i
have
not
had
many
sour
beers
and
just
opened
me
up
to
a
whole
new
world
of
beer
d
this
is
the
benchmark
gueuze
for
me
and
one
that
all
others
are
compared
to
a
brew
that
truly
has
refined
the
style
and
it
also
drinks
like
water
mmm
so
refreshing
from
a
12
7
oz
bottle
it
poured
a
dark
yellow
color
with
lots
of
bubbles
and
a
fresh
filmy
white
head
that
dissipated
smell
was
sour
funk
and
hay
with
lemon
and
earth
smell
taste
was
lemonfruit
tart
with
some
oak
and
a
sour
barnyard
finish
mouth
feel
was
tart
and
crisp
dry
and
smooth
on
the
palate
very
drinkable
but
more
tart
than
souras
it
warmed
it
just
got
better
and
better
very
enjoyable
a
well
above
average
gueze
overall
for
something
this
sour
this
is
actually
going
down
very
easy
only
5
helps
but
there
is
so
much
more
this
was
9
for
12
oz
so
this
wont
be
a
regular
thing
but
this
is
something
i
will
pine
away
for
fine
brew
d
highly
drinkable
nice
abv
makes
it
more
drinkable
for
me
and
very
refreshing
im
getting
this
whole
sour
thing
now
an
impeccable
gueuze
simply
delicious
and
satisfying
d
i
could
definitely
drink
more
of
these
this
is
one
of
the
best
guezes
i
have
had
d
still
getting
used
to
drinking
sours
but
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
d
one
of
the
best
and
most
consistent
gueuzes
out
there
i
could
drink
this
by
the
case
strong
bodied
pronounced
sour
but
smooth
taste
the
arome
i
taste
of
natural
cider
is
very
earthy
and
fruity
all
at
the
same
time
i
realy
like
that
type
of
beer
i
hope
to
taste
more
of
these
beers
pours
a
slightly
hazy
orange
with
a
slight
head
but
reasonably
lively
carbonation
smells
funky
like
a
ripe
washed
rind
cheese
definitely
in
the
smelly
socks
direction
but
strangely
in
a
good
way
and
somewhat
restrained
acetic
as
well
the
taste
is
clean
lemony
sour
and
a
little
on
the
thin
side
but
finishes
with
some
nice
clean
funkiness
smooth
a
little
wonky
and
refreshing
nice
classic
gueuze
md
it
is
very
bitter
and
sour
but
crisp
and
clean
all
at
the
same
time
i
could
finish
one
bottle
but
that
is
all
i
can
handle
in
a
night
i
would
make
this
an
endcap
to
an
evening
d
not
an
every
day
not
a
session
but
pretty
tasty
this
beer
is
one
of
the
more
sour
and
acidic
gueuzes
that
ive
tried
comparing
it
to
others
such
as
girarden
or
oude
beersel
i
had
it
with
garlic
musselswith
no
frites
too
bad
next
time
ill
have
to
be
better
prepared
drinkability
the
first
cantillon
lambic
i
had
was
very
very
dry
and
overly
sour
this
one
is
still
very
dry
and
very
sour
though
more
complex
than
the
other
even
if
you
dont
like
unblended
lambics
gueuze
may
be
the
way
to
go
i
like
this
beer
and
it
is
a
shame
that
i
dont
have
proper
cellaring
space
this
beer
like
champagne
seems
great
for
a
celebration
such
as
a
wedding
or
the
new
year
etc
when
i
get
some
cellaring
space
ill
buy
a
few
bottles
of
this
to
put
away
for
later
this
is
another
impressive
cantillon
sharp
and
acidic
very
refreshing
highly
recommended
d
one
of
their
flagship
beers
cantillon
classic
geuze
is
everything
youd
expect
from
this
brewery
tart
lively
complex
and
super
drinkable
in
addition
this
ones
sure
to
evolve
with
age
a
definite
must
try
for
anyone
whos
into
sours
d
delicoius
and
interesting
for
my
first
sour
i
think
it
was
a
good
choice
even
though
gueuzes
tend
to
be
the
most
intense
ones
for
someone
has
been
deep
into
the
bitter
side
of
beer
hophead
this
is
a
nice
eyeopening
beer
d
i
know
this
beer
can
age
well
but
if
it
gets
drier
and
more
acidic
it
will
probably
move
further
away
from
my
sweet
spot
right
now
it
seems
to
be
just
right
when
young
quite
drinkable
maybe
a
bit
on
the
sipper
side
and
its
very
tasty
looks
a
nice
grapefruitstraw
color
translucent
and
pretty
nice
sour
smell
grapes
and
peach
tastes
like
sour
grapes
and
peaches
too
the
mouth
feel
is
medium
a
really
nice
beer
to
sip
on
a
highly
drinkable
sour
beer
a
nice
blend
of
young
and
old
lambics
taste
is
similar
and
it
virtually
matches
my
idealized
version
of
the
style
big
lemon
tart
backed
up
with
some
pale
malt
and
funk
goes
great
with
my
omelette
feel
is
puckeringly
dry
good
carbonation
to
keep
it
moving
long
finish
great
drinkability
fantastic
beer
here
bottle
was
shared
and
poured
into
small
glasses
and
i
was
surprised
by
the
rose
colour
of
the
beer
with
a
white
head
that
left
light
to
no
lacing
a
very
fruity
apple
nose
to
the
beer
smells
like
an
apple
cider
rather
than
a
beer
when
i
first
sipped
it
was
evident
why
they
call
these
beers
sour
wowza
thats
not
to
say
i
didnt
like
it
i
just
had
trouble
initially
discerning
other
flavours
from
it
over
time
the
bitter
sourness
lets
some
of
the
fruitiness
come
through
interesting
but
tough
on
the
palate
and
tough
to
drink
nov
2009
750ml
lemony
sharp
lactic
sourness
mild
funk
increasingly
tannic
and
woody
as
the
beer
warms
very
good
should
improve
nicely
with
age
d
i
will
have
to
say
i
enjoyed
this
overall
you
have
to
be
in
the
mood
for
this
type
of
beer
to
truly
enjoy
it
i
probably
didnt
pick
up
on
all
of
the
character
of
this
beer
as
im
a
novice
the
good
thing
is
that
i
now
want
to
try
more
beers
like
this
ill
pick
this
up
again
after
i
have
a
more
experienced
palate
hazy
gold
pour
with
a
bubbly
white
head
retention
and
lacing
is
very
good
for
the
style
and
rings
of
white
lace
are
deposited
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
nose
is
musty
and
redolent
of
horse
blanket
and
lemon
the
cobwebs
of
the
brewery
seem
to
revel
in
its
funky
aroma
the
flavour
leaves
a
dominant
impression
of
fresh
lemon
juice
funk
wet
hay
and
a
warm
yeastiness
its
just
like
a
sour
and
dry
white
wine
wonderfully
puckeringly
delightful
and
refreshing
the
body
is
in
perfect
sync
with
its
lightness
and
spritzy
carbonation
cantillon
have
stolen
my
heart
and
made
me
reassess
gueuze
the
price
was
well
worth
paying
mouthfeel
is
good
medium
bodied
drinkability
is
good
for
a
sour
definately
needs
to
be
shared
great
beer
and
im
glad
i
finally
got
to
try
it
d
a
very
drinkable
beer
low
abv
and
a
complex
flavor
make
this
a
very
enjoyablerefreshing
beer
especially
when
sipped
dvery
nice
complexity
interesting
sensewise
i
would
drink
this
again
pours
a
soft
golden
color
with
a
small
white
head
that
hangs
around
for
a
while
smells
of
deep
tart
oranges
deep
earth
andk
a
rich
brettfunk
the
aroma
is
just
wonderful
the
taste
is
very
tart
with
a
deep
earthy
barn
flavor
almost
reminiscent
of
a
must
basement
fruit
cellar
very
clean
and
crisp
with
a
balanced
acidity
a
wonderful
beer
the
mouth
feel
and
drink
ability
were
both
good
but
not
great
this
bottle
could
definitely
use
some
age
on
it
overall
this
is
a
very
well
made
beer
a
nice
and
solid
beer
for
the
style
and
the
fact
that
it
comes
from
cantillon
doesnt
come
as
a
surprise
well
worth
a
shot
d
great
light
and
crisp
enough
the
sour
keeps
my
watering
mouth
begging
for
the
next
sip
a
very
well
balanced
and
complex
sour
ale
that
twarts
the
notion
of
onedimensionality
or
simplicity
characterful
and
as
unoffensive
as
true
sours
can
be
had
this
on
tap
at
city
beer
store
in
sf
gold
in
color
with
surprising
clarity
for
style
nominal
head
and
no
real
lacing
to
speak
of
but
on
point
for
style
the
nose
is
a
bit
funky
with
notes
of
grape
and
melon
with
pleasant
vinegar
qualities
even
a
bit
of
coriander
this
a
real
palate
pleaser
slight
tartness
with
a
very
clean
finish
apple
and
melon
are
noticeable
on
the
midpalate
along
with
some
hay
qualities
very
tasty
and
extremely
refreshing
for
a
warm
summer
day
i
wish
these
bottles
were
a
little
closer
to
my
house
dalthough
light
the
taste
is
pretty
funky
and
while
i
enjoyed
this
brew
very
much
i
dont
think
i
could
drink
more
than
two
in
one
sitting
still
i
love
it
d
this
beer
has
a
nice
up
front
tartness
in
the
flavor
with
some
nice
tartness
in
the
finish
but
the
other
flavors
were
pretty
soft
medium
bodied
good
carbonation
just
a
slight
tingle
highly
drinkable
hard
to
keep
it
in
the
glass
for
too
long
truly
a
classic
gueuze
however
id
rate
drie
fonteinen
oude
gueuze
slightly
higher
drinkability
i
could
sip
this
all
night
its
very
robust
nose
and
even
stronger
flavors
to
boot
that
are
super
sour
yet
come
across
with
some
sweet
candi
sugars
mustiness
etc
acidity
creeps
in
after
a
bit
and
becomes
a
bit
much
but
really
the
flavors
are
so
amazing
and
create
such
a
crazy
drinking
experieince
that
the
drinkability
is
still
solid
wow
very
long
lasting
cascade
produces
a
small

cantillon
at
its
finest
god
i
love
these
beers
awesome
example
of
the
style
wish
i
could
get
it
where
i
live
paired
amazingly
well
with
the
lobster
roll
i
had
for
lunch
taste
is
quite
unique
as
well
very
sour
with
apples
a
hint
of
yeast
and
lemons
very
warming
for
a
low
alcohol
beer
the
bottle
said
to
drink
this
pretty
warm
at
55f
not
as
bubbly
on
the
tongue
as
i
thought
it
would
be
i
expected
alkaseltzer
but
glad
i
didnt
get
it
this
appears
to
be
a
very
good
representative
of
the
style
but
i
am
no
expert
i
love
cantillon
that
is
all
d
this
is
a
fantastic
goto
brew
rarely
is
a
gueuze
better
drinkability
tart
funky
complex
a
bit
too
astringent
for
me
to
consider
drinking
on
a
regular
basis
but
i
really
enjoyed
it
it
kept
me
engaged
and
challenged
my
palate
drinkabilitythis
2009
vintage
is
still
kind
of
harsh
it
probably
needs
a
few
more
years
in
the
bottle
medium
carbonated
with
a
fluffy
light
to
medium
body
smooth
and
slick
over
the
tongue
refreshing
and
invigorating

perfectly
crafted
lambic

i
tried
this
beer
on
june
182009
at
the
beer
bistro
in
toronto
ontario
canada
the
beer
was
bottled
on
february
22
2008
and
if
stored
in
a
cool
dry
place
would
keep
until
2030
it
said
so
on
the
bottle
the
beer
poured
a
cloudy
gold
colour
with
a
very
thin
white
head
the
aroma
was
sour
cherries
and
apples
with
a
little
bit
of
malt
the
mouthfeel
was
dry
very
tart
highly
carbonated
and
medium
bodied
the
flavour
was
tart
apples
and
some
graininess
very
enjoyable
i
cant
imagine
a
guezue
getting
much
better
the
balance
is
tremendous
and
the
funk
is
so
wellexecuted
this
is
the
best
guezue
ive
ever
had
if
there
are
better
than
i
really
really
want
to
try
them
please
give
them
to
me
im
down
for
trades
very
drinkable
beer
this
beer
is
simply
a
classic
as
the
label
so
aptly
suggests
wellcarbonated
nice
body
leaves
sour
film
all
over
your
mouth
750ml
by
myself
wasnt
too
much
of
a
problem
d
this
is
just
a
classic
beauty
theres
nothing
more
to
say
great
complexity
and
flavour
and
i
was
really
racing
through
the
bottle
the
acidity
is
not
nuts
it
just
makes
the
beer
that
much
more
drinkable
this
beer
is
still
quite
rare
in
the
southland
so
im
trying
to
milk
it
as
much
as
possible
d
really
nice
gueuze
very
tasty
and
tart
making
it
a
great
sipper
d
couldnt
finish
the
entire
large
bottle
which
is
unusual
for
me
too
freakin
sour
and
my
tastebuds
just
couldnt
take
it
after
a
while
good
but
in
small
doses
this
was
an
amazing
shock
to
the
taste
buds
today
i
recommend
that
everyone
breaks
away
from
their
favorite
style
once
and
awhile
just
to
give
your
senses
something
new
to
enjoy
as
far
as
drinkability
goes
this
one
is
really
going
to
be
up
to
you
because
it
is
so
different
from
any
style
out
there
id
say
that
its
pretty
drinkable
but
not
in
large
quantities
and
im
glad
that
it
was
in
a
short
bottle
this
beer
was
refreshing
and
tart
and
i
could
see
it
pairing
very
well
with
lots
of
foods
and
desserts
if
you
happen
to
come
across
this
style
of
beer
go
for
it
you
never
know
what
youll
think
unless
you
try
it
750ml
bottle
in
a
wine
glass
pours
the
color
of
honey
opaque
with
bubbly
white
head
taste
is
sour
obvi
think
of
lemonlimey
sour
more
than
funk
but
without
the
harshness
really
hits
the
front
of
your
tongue
the
aftertaste
is
pleasing
but
its
tough
to
get
to
all
the
subtle
flavors
going
on
underneath
light
to
medium
bodied
acidic
with
low
carbonation
finishes
very
dry
a
nice
complex
gueuze
which
is
well
made
and
definitely
worth
seeking
out
again
pour
is
like
apple
juice
with
a
small
head
and
a
bit
of
murk
nose
of
apples
and
lambic
funk
palate
is
has
a
lot
of
latitude
for
something
that
is
suppose
to
be
asstringent
and
contracting
for
the
tastebuds
sour
apple
with
some
woodiness
but
the
finish
is
key
a
bit
of
malt
quality
of
honey
and
pollen
deep
in
there
palate
if
he
finish
beside
sour
is
prodominently
oaky
a
mild
finish
that
sit
on
the
tongue
and
reveals
qualities
of
lilly
and
other
floral
delicacies
great
beer
is
thin
and
kind
of
fruity
with
lots
of
great
flavors
finishes
cleanly
nice
lactic
and
acetic
notes
with
great
tartness
at
the
corners
drinkability
high
mouthfeel
great
one
of
the
best
gueuzes
ive
ever
had
pours
a
hazy
golden
straw
color
with
moderate
head
of
prickly
bubbles
and
decent
spotty
sheets
of
lacing
scent
is
mild
and
light
watery
grape
and
apple
hints
of
spice
backed
my
a
young
funkynees
and
freshly
dried
straw
taste
is
a
touch
more
aggressive
but
still
controlled
and
light
pressed
grapes
and
skins
the
grain
notes
are
a
little
more
pronounced
along
with
a
muted
barnyard
funk
and
tart
tastes
a
lighter
medium
body
spritzy
at
first
but
carbonation
disapears
quickly
dry
a
nice
classic
style
done
without
much
to
get
in
the
way
of
that
fact
d
refreshing
but
definitely
a
sipper
due
to
the
sourness
throughout
which
stops
just
short
of
making
this
a
difficult
drink
challenging
but
rewarding
d
its
pretty
tasty
but
i
cant
usually
have
more
than
one
of
these
dont
even
try
going
to
a
mild
style
of
beer
after
this
as
it
leaves
your
tastebuds
scorched
d
at
only
5
abv
this
is
my
session
beer
love
this
style
cantillon
classic
gueuze
is
superbly
balanced
and
delicious
it
probably
deserves
a
5
for
taste
with
so
much
going
on
and
so
harmoniously
ill
be
buying
this
again
hopefully
often
db
pricey
but
good
a
well
craftedstrenuous
beer
to
make
the
flavors
are
nice
and
balanced
but
did
not
blow
me
away
a
very
nice
example
of
what
bacteria
and
yeast
are
capable
of
doing
to
a
beer
a
good
one
to
split
but
i
could
enjoy
a
whole
750ml
d
i
had
this
beer
when
it
was
in
its
youth
ill
revisit
this
vintage
again
a
few
times
over
the
next
decade
if
my
willpower
holds
out
not
something
id
want
every
day
but
a
benchmark
for
the
style
overall
world
class
not
cloyingly
sweet
like
pasteurized
and
blended
lambics
just
straight
up
sourness
with
an
amazingly
complex
fruity
flavor
profile
i
dont
think
i
could
drink
it
all
night
long
but
its
something
i
would
gladly
buy
again
d
very
enjoyable
the
750
ml
bottle
is
perfect
for
2
d
very
good
stuff
it
might
be
a
bit
too
intense
for
a
whole
bottle
to
yourself
though
d
whenever
i
have
a
good
gueuze
i
cant
help
but
say
to
myself
i
would
like
to
wake
up
every
weekend
and
drink
one
for
breakfast
with
waffles
whipped
cream
and
fresh
fruit
cantillon
is
highly
regarded
for
a
reason
this
is
just
one
of
many
the
beer
is
clear
sunset
orange
with
a
medium
sized
head
and
spotty
lacing
the
aroma
offers
barnyard
funk
straw
tart
lemons
citrus
beautiful
and
simple
classic
cantillon
nose
and
flavor
a
graceful
acetic
presence
with
a
subtle
burn
in
the
finish
very
smooth
with
moderately
low
carbonation
very
enjoyable
as
the
label
states
a
classic
i
was
never
fond
of
lambics
due
to
only
having
the
fruited
ones
now
i
need
to
get
more
of
this
i
can
see
setting
back
one
after
another
in
the
summer
rather
than
a
mojito
or
a
shandy
drinkability
awesome
gueuze
could
drink
this
all
day
not
an
intro
gueuze
as
the
sourness
is
prominent
but
very
very
good
with
great
clarity
this
beer
is
light
orange
with
a
dense
offwhite
head
with
great
retention
and
lacing
the
nose
to
quote
devin
townsend
oh
my
fuck
ing
god
musty
as
hell
with
plenty
of
tannins
grapefruit
copious
funk
this
is
exceptional
the
blend
and
balance
of
musty
basement
with
bright
citrus
character
is
particularly
exceptional
the
palate
opens
tart
and
salty
very
limburgerlike
while
tannic
this
is
still
very
bright
and
lemony
with
moderate
citrus
musty
cheesy
funky
this
is
the
paragon
of
an
aged
gueuze
i
cant
help
but
stress
how
wonderful
the
balance
between
the
tannins
and
the
citrus
is
this
is
just
fabulous
stuff
d
just
a
classic
beer
for
the
style
so
the
name
fits
it
well
allaround
just
plain
good
and
tasty
the
beer
is
very
drinkable
because
of
the
minimal
alcohol
percentage
and
the
extremely
dry
finish
that
keeps
one
thirsty
for
more
nothing
short
of
perfection
a
musthave
when
you
speak
about
lambic
bottled
in
2009
on
the
cork
pours
a
slightly
hazy
light
orange
with
a
thin
ring
of
lace
smell
which
you
can
smell
from
across
the
room
vinegar
lemon
barnyard
but
more
like
zoo
funk
taste
lime
grapefruit
sour
cherry
the
tart
and
sour
fades
into
funky
midsip
finish
is
green
grapeskin
with
a
hint
of
sweetness
low
on
the
carbonation
which
is
not
very
noticeable
because
its
pretty
much
puckering
finishes
dry
i
had
a
hard
time
with
the
combination
of
big
funk
and
big
lacticness
in
the
aroma
but
its
certainly
tasty
insanely
easy
drinking
this
is
young
and
im
sure
it
will
become
more
sour
over
time
and
the
sweetness
may
even
take
a
back
seat
i
cannot
wait
to
see
what
some
time
does
to
this
d
this
makes
for
a
nice
sipping
beer
not
because
of
the
abv
but
because
it
is
astringent
i
only
have
one
bottle
but
i
think
that
after
one
you
wouldnt
be
able
to
differentiate
tastes
as
well
because
of
the
astringency
a
good
beer
for
people
looking
to
get
into
lambics
or
gueuze
drinkability
a
really
superb
geuze
with
all
kind
of
subtleties
d
what
a
great
opportunity
to
try
this
96
vintage
lots
of
sour
and
funk
still
hanging
around
in
this
brewit
has
really
held
up
well
id
like
to
try
this
a
bit
fresher
so
i
can
look
back
and
compare
the
experiences

ive
been
into

lately
and
this
hit
the
spot
strong
flavors
but
not
off
putting
well
done
d
delicious
yet
light
and
very
refreshing
akin
to
a
good
and
slightly
dry
and
not
overly
sweet
champagne
closing
my
eyes
and
sipping
on
this
puts
me
outside
on
my
porch
on
a
warm
june
evening
d
overall
im
really
enjoying
this
beer
perhaps
a
bit
too
high
on
the
skunky
funk
but
that
seems
to
be
less
noticeable
as
i
go
thru
the
bottle
very
good
example
not
my
favorite
but
beers
like
this
make
me
wonder
why
i
sometimes
spend
so
much
time
effort
and
money
getting
the
superhyped
superrare
american
wilds
when
i
can
go
to
any
number
of
local
stores
and
pick
up
fine
examples
of
the
style
like
this
for
normal
prices
probably
wont
stop
me
from
hitting
the
overhyped
stuff
but
still
makes
me
wonder
the
flavor
is
crisp
and
very
tart
apples
with
a
dry
finish
ethers
are
slightly
present
as
well
as
dry
vinegary
aftertaste
over
all
the
mouth
feel
is
much
less
busy
than
the
oude
and
this
comes
across
as
a
more
focused
and
easier
drinking
gueuze
than
the
oude
actually
this
is
much
easier
to
drink
than
the
oude
and
i
find
the
overall
effect
of
this
beer
more
inviting
i
would
use
this
to
entice
wine
fans
over
to
the
beer
side
of
things
overall
a
great
and
tasty
beer
and
a
wonderful
introduction
to
as
well
gueuze
some
cantillon
brews
are
so
sour
your
stomach
starts
to
feel
it
not
so

this

i
said

deep

ml
corkncrown
champagne
bottle
bottled
in
2007
brewed
with
65
barley
and
35
raw
wheat
with
5
grams
per
liter
of
three
year
old
hops
this
is
a
blend
of
one
two
and
three
year
old
lambics
that
spent
upwards
of
a
year
at
the
brewery
to
fully
carbonate
it
pours
a
beautiful
chillhazed
golden
orange
with
a
thin
white
cap
that
leaves
little
lacing
very
inviting
cleaner
that
i
was
expecting
in
the
nose
with
a
little
funkiness
oak
cork
and
an
earthy
character
pretty
crazy
sour
on
the
palate
with
oak
cork
and
a
strong
acidic
note
little
musty
as
well
with
mild
malts
cherry
pits
sharp
lemon
and
a
bit
of
bitterness
oddly
enough
it
has
a
light
and
tingly
very
dry
body
with
teethpeeling
sourness
that
attacks
the
back
of
the
throat
despite
the
wildly
sour
character
of
this
beer
it
is
imminently
drinkable
and
very
refreshing
fans
of
gueuze
need
to
seek
out
this
beer
this
is
probably
the
gueuze
all
gueuzes
should
be
judged
on
always
a
classic
and
having
it
readily
available
doesnt
hurt
either
j
overall
it
doesnt
get
much
better
than
this
worldclass
this
is
a
total
sipper
obviously
i
could
spend
a
whole
night
with
just
one
bottle
but
if
you
like
sour
its
perfect
ill
certainly
be
drinking
this
againim
positive
that
there
will
be
many
days
when
i
wake
up
craving
that
sour
flavor
excellent
choice
for
my
first
gueuze
the
carbonation
is
really
high
i
havent
tried
more
than
a
handful
of
real
lambic
style
beers
and
this
is
only
my
third
gueuze
so
i
dont
have
a
good
sample
size
whether
i
prefer
a
high
or
low
carbonation
on
these
styles
of
beers
im
leaning
towards
that
i
prefer
low
carbonation
because
i
tend
to
keep
each
sip
in
my
mouth
longer
in
order
to
fully
taste
and
appreciate
the
flavors
in
a
highly
carbonated
example
like
this
the
carbonation
gets
too
distracting
despite
of
that
and
how
sour
it
is
i
still
found
it
of
above
average
drinkability
and
my
mouth
wasnt
permanently
puckered
and
weeping
after
the
whole
bottle
this
is
classic
cantillon
really
good
i
would
have
like
a
little
more
subtle
flavors
but
it
is
everything
anybody
would
want
from
the
brewery
recommended
the
lowmedium
carbonation
increases
the
mustiness
and
dirty
feeling
felt
on
your
tongue
through
the
finish
and
aftertaste
this
is
such
an
enjoyable
and
satisfying
beer
to
drink
but
its
by
no
means
a
session
beer
and
a
750ml
bottle
is
ideally
split
at
least
3
ways
i
look
forward
to
getting
more
bottles
for
my
cellar
an
excellent
concoction
this
was
a
very
interesting
beer
its
refreshing
but
the
intense
flavors
command
small
sips
id
love
to
have
more
of
this
d
while
not
a
session
brew
this
sour
brew
is
very
refreshing
and
would
be
great
to
enjoy
outside
on
a
90
degree
summer
day
a
very
solid
example
of
this
style
probably
my
personal
favorite
i
love
this
beer
its
not
iris
good
though
hannaford
d
very
easy
thanks
to
the
abv
assuming
you
like
sour
beers
i
suppose
honestly
this
was
a
gueuze
that
i
could
see
kickstarting
an
addiction
for
sour
beers
up
until
this
point
i
have
tried
a
few
beers
that
were
sour
but
this
one
really
gave
me
some
wow
factor
i
am
loving
it
overall
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
gueuze
no
complaints
and
no
real
mouth
pounding
acidity
wonderful
d
after
the
initial
tartness
dies
down
the
becomes
very
easy
to
drink
this
seems
like
a
complex
beer
that
would
age
well
will
definitely
drink
again
d
im
going
to
cork
the
rest
of
the
bottle
to
share
with
a
friend
in
a
bit
its
funky
and
good
but
one
glass
will
do
unlike
any
other
beer
out
there
d
smoothest
and
most
elegant
gueuze
that
ive
had
really
something
special
on
tap
overall
an
excellent
gueuze
no
doubt
i
can
definitely
tell
this
is
a
young
gueuze
and
i
can
easily
see
that
this
will
only
get
better
with
age
gaining
complexity
i
cant
wait
to
try
my
older
bottle
a
couple
years
down
the
road
d
this
is
a
very
tart
and
refreshing
gueuze
and
while
it
is
not
as
complex
as
some
of
cantillons
other
offerings
it
is
very
drinkable
the
fruit
character
is
probably
the
most
outstanding
feature
characterized
by
a
nice
candied
orange
note
in
the
flavor
the
wild
character
is
kind
of
lacking
in
complexity
and
somewhat
onedimensional
but
there
is
a
good
level
of
sourness
that
makes
for
a
very
refreshing
beer
d
very
drinkable
considering
its
a
lambic
though
im
glad
i
had
friends
to
share
the
bottle
with
the
flavor
opens
with
succulent
tart
lemon
with
a
whisper
of
orange
the
beer
seems
to
suck
the
moisture
out
of
my
mouth
with
its
tannins
and
then
quench
my
thirst
with
tart
citrus
the
beer
is
extremely
woody
and
it
has
a
nice
high
level
of
funk
the
beer
has
a
moderate
lactic
quality
the
brett
imparts
horsey
goaty
cheesy
musty
and
wet
barnyard
blanket
notes
the
citric
acidity
is
high
and
theres
a
low
level
of
acetic
character
the
beer
seems
to
rip
the
enamel
off
my
teeth
with
its
acidity
the
finish
is
dry
woody
tannic
and
tart
with
lingering
lemon
an
aged
gueuze
is
an
amazing
experience
what
could
possibly
be
better
d
a
very
drinkable
gueuze
i
can
drink
this
stuff
all
night
and
wouldnt
anticipate
the
sourness
to
become
too
overpowering
light
body
and
carbonation
i
would
have
liked
it
to
be
more
lively
drinkability
is
great
for
a
guezelambic
lover
i
love
it
but
not
everyone
has
to
as
it
is
pretty
powerful
stuff
all
in
all
another
highly
enjoyable
cantillon
brew
these
beers
are
becoming
a
regular
part
of
my
beer
runs
hopefully
i
can
find
more
cantillon
offerings
in
these
smaller
bottles
as
the
big
ones
are
a
little
pricey
ddispite
some
of
my
complaints
this
is
a
great
beer
just
not
as
funky
and
complex
as
other
cantillon
gueuzes
ive
had
in
the
past
could
use
a
touch
more
carbonation
and
more
brett
seemed
almost
one
dimentional
or
at
least
with
less
dimentions
then
usual
the
taste
is
like
sour
sprite
in
a
a
good
way
i
get
more
of
the
leatherbarnyard
fuck
but
teh
acidity
shows
up
a
lot
more
its
like
you
let
a
bunch
of
citrus
fruits
rot
ferment
and
then
poured
them
over
some
really
funky
cheese
then
strained
that
through
some
20
year
old
boots
and
poured
it
up
despite
the
disgusting
way
i
described
it
i
really
really
like
this
beer
drinkability
would
be
a
perfect
beer
for
a
hot
day
if
youre
just
looking
to
sip
on
something
delicious
or
you
just
want
something
different
and
super
complex
really
really
good
d
very
nice
beer
one
of
my
very
first
sours
dont
know
if
i
would
drink
a
lot
but
this
one
is
good
none
the
less
drinkability
is
excellent
beers
like
this
will
always
get
some
bad
reviews
because
the
flavors
are
so
polarizing
which
is
unfortunate
this
is
a
supremely
sour
and
fresh
brew
with
a
tart
profile
and
a
sourness
that
plays
off
of
a
light
funk
helping
to
sustain
the
crispness
what
a
solid
beer
it
dances
on
the
palate
with
its
light
sharpness
and
leaves
the
palate
puckering
for
the
next
sip
cheers
this
is
so
sour
that
you
have
to
drink
it
slow
to
savour
it
its
a
good
representation
of
the
gueuze
but
i
dont
think
its
my
style
very
interesting
brew
lots
of
flavors
that
play
off
each
other
excellently
not
something
i
would
drink
very
much
of
but
great

a
special

the

it
formed

surprisingly
20
minutes

it

broken
the

the

at

today
i
think
i
was
in

mood
for
something
more

so
that
really
fit

sourness

benefit

dry

the

is
very
mature

if
i
actually
wouldve
liked
it
if
i
had
never
heard
of
such
a
thing
before
but
the
bottom
line
was
i
did
like
it
i
wouldnt
crave
this
one
right
after
a
long
day
to
crack
open
and
relax
with
like
a
nice
quenching
ale
but
i
could
see
it
as
being
a
unique
choice
once

thanks
to

bringing
this
to
the

in
a
12
oz
green
bottle
which
was
adorned
with
black
foil
neck
wrapping
uncapping
the
bottle
revealed
a
cork
underneath
which
seems
to
be
a
standard
for
belgian
premium
beers
the
pour
into
a
tumbler
was
a
cloudy
peachy
orange
color
with
an
initial
fizz
of
carbonation
that
disappeared
very
quickly
the
aroma
was
very
unique
its
hard
to
put
into
words
what
this
beer
smells
like
but
ill
try
anyway
i
could
detect
wet
grass
sour
apples
green
onions
and
pickled
vegetables
as
weird
as
it
may
sound
the
smells
actually
got
my
mouth
watering
the
taste
is
also
extremely
unique
the
beer
exhibits
a
mouth
puckering
vinegary
sourness
at
first
sip
the
sourness
is
accompanied
by
a
peppery
spiciness
and
a
hint
of
bitterness
there
is
no
sweetness
to
balance
these
tastes
out
but
sweet
drinks
are
for
babies
any
way
as
the
beer
warms
it
gets
a
bit
creamier
on
the
palette
tempering
the
astringency
the
5
abv
is
so
far
down
the
radar
it
slips
past
the
tongue
and
only
shows
up
as
a
warming
sensation
in
the
belly
this
is
a
light
and
refreshing
traditional
gueuze
which
should
be
enjoyable
in
the
upcoming
summer
months
this
gueuze
poured
a
hazy
golden
color
with
thin
white
foam
that
settled
the
smell
was
a
strong
tart
lambic
aroma
horse
blanket
and
sour
apples
the
taste
was
sour
and
tart
puckering
with
green
apples
and
grape
skins
and
horse
blanket
flavors
the
aftertaste
was
bitter
and
dry
the
mouthfeel
was
dry
and
tart
and
crisp
with
medium
body
and
sharp
carbonation
this
was
a
very
crisp
and
refreshing
gueuze
sampled

definitely
the
most
puckering
lambic
ive
ever
had
though
this
wouldnt
certainly
be
made
for
public
consumption
i
know
i
certainly
am
enjoying
it
and
i
definitely
hope
to
have
this
one
in
the
future

something

comes

fantastic
glad
ive
saved
the
750

to
share
with
a
couple
friends
one
of
the
finest
examples
of
the
blended
lambic
style
ive
tried
first
sip
wow
that
is
tart
the
sourness
makes
my
tongue
pucker
a
little
what
a
fun
beer
i
get
sour
granny
smith
apples
and
then
a
faint
sweet
sugary
hit
with
a
finish
that
leaves
my
tongue
feeling
funny
this
is
a
tasty
brew
and
easy
to
drink
after
the
initial
sip
and
adjusting
to
the
tartness
very
complex
beer
and
i
am
glad
i
tried
this
one
poured
into
a
rapscallion
snifter
for
lack
of
the
correct
glassware
very
effervescent
lots
of
tiny
bubbles
form
in
the
pouring
process
they
all
gather
together
to
form
a
thick
white
head
when
alls
said
and
done
and
the
bottles
empty
the
fluffy
head
slowly
collapses
on
itself

sharp

not
unlike
that
of

easily
transmits
light
through
and
through
taste
is
defined
by
tartness
which
is
initally
overpowering
due
to
my
not
knowing
exactly
what
to
expect
after
a
few
sips
it
seems
to
settle
down
a
bit
with
the
flavor
rounding
out
with
some
apple
and
citrus
tones
and
even
a
slight
oaken
aftertaste
a
complex
and
pleasing
brew
which
after
all
isnt
that
surprising
considering
the

dont
import

making
it
a

experience
that
i
would
love
to
taste
at
brasserie
cantillon
the
first
sip
provided
me
with
a
big
kick
in
the
face
of
tart
fruits
yep
this
is
a
gueuze
all
right
the
peaches
really
seem
to
come
out
in
the
flavor
apples
die
a
bit
and
the
pears
are
all
there
citrus
flavors
come
in
to
join
the
party
all
of
them
combine
into
a
massive
tart
flavor
that
causes
salivation
at
the
end
of
every
single
sip
allowing
me
to
suck
in
some
more
of
this
fine
nectar
i
find
myself
trying
to
squeeze
more
out
of
the
sides
of
my
mouth
the
woody
notes
are
a
very
nice
addition
and
they
provide
a
bit
of
balance
as
well
as
an
aid
to
complexity
it
is
very
smooth
with
almost
no
carbonation
at
all
drinkability
is
excellent
and
a
750
may
not
be
enough
i
will
do
my
best
to
keep
myself
from
breaking
the
bottle
and
licking
the
insides

i
fully

aroma
i
do
quite
like
their
kriek

when
they
are

about

just
stunning
in
the
mouth
acidic
and
on
the
light
side
of
medium
its
a
malty
earthy
barnyard
lemony
leathery
feast
for
the
palate
longer
than
a
timeshare
condo
presentation
a
wonderful
softness
from
the
bottleconditioning
despite
the
incredible
acidity
just
great
stuff
could
i
drink
it
for
long
not
more
than
i
could
suck
a
lemon
for
long
but
wow
on
a
special
occasion
and
in
the
right
mood
this
is
really
special
sipping
try
it
but
be
warned
theres
no
turning
back
this
one
is
quite
sour
smelling
there
is
lots
of
acidity
one
of
the
harder
gueuzes
out
there
and
tastes
of
grapefruit
well
carbonated
and
has
a
woody
finish
that
is
accompanied
by
a
light
bitterness
though
quite
sour
this
beer
still
manages
to
be
well
balanced
with
lots
of
different
things
going
on
a
good
traditional
example
of
this
style
this
beer
has
a
deep
golden
hue
to
it
but
it
glows
an
almost
luminescent
orange
a
compact
and
long
lasting
white
head
adorns
the
surface
carbonation
noted
is
modest
theres
a
nice
musty
aroma
to
this
beer
also
a
little
of
that
barnyardhorse
blanket
aroma
mixed
in
and
some
lemongrass
and
vinegar
on
the
nose
as
well
very
inviting
i
think
this
gueuze
nails
the
flavor
profile
right
on
the
nose
for
the
style
just
delicious
quite
drinkable
im
surprised
at
how
fast
im
drinking
this
lambic
the
mouthpuckering
quotient
seems
a
bit
tamer
in
this
one
than
in
other
styles
of
cantillon
ive
enjoyed
kriek
and
rose
i
like
the
way
the
tart
acidity
is
kept
in
check
but
still
is
allowed
to
give
an
abundance
of
character
to
the
beer
some
hay
and
stale
hops
are
noted
vinegar
and
a
somewhat
crass
farmyard
flavor
that
is
quite
enjoyable
damn
fine
gueuze
f
i
sampled
this
at
the
cantillon
brewery
where
it
is
served
in
a
wicker
basket
on
its
side
at
room
temperature
gueuze
is
a
very
distinctive
brew
and
is
certainly
not
for
everyone
personally
im
enjoying
the
style
since
my
first
exposure
to
it
in
belgium
this
pours
a
light
golden
color
with
a
large
fizzy
head
from
the
corked
and
capped
magnum
bottle
its
smell
is
fresh
and
tart
and
one
can
tell
that
acidity
is
on
its
way
before
even
tasting
it
notes
of
honey
are
also
present
in
the
nose
the
taste
to
me
is
unlike
anything
ive
tried
the
acidity
creates
a
menacing
pucker
effect
at
first
but
for
me
that
drew
me
in
closer
to
the
beer
where
i
discovered
notes
of
granny
smith
apples
honey
and
sugar
mouthfeel
is
quite
carbonated
and
cuts
through
ones
palate
like
a
fine
champagne
this
actually
drinks
quite
well
on
a
warm
day
super
refreshing
with
its
big
acidity
and
citrus
notes
wonderfully
complex
yet
remarkably
enjoyable
a
fantastic
traditional
offering
from
cantillon
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
this
is
the
basis
for
anything
lambic
the
tartness
may
turn
some
off
but
it
can
be
paired
with
food
that
no
wine
can
come
close
to
this
was
my
first
nonfruit
lambic
and
it
really
opened
up
my
eyes
to
this
style
taste
is
very
sour
with
hints
of
apple
this
lambic
is
remarkably
clear
golden
with
a
slight
orange
effect
and
has
an
extremely
active
white
head
smells
sweet
and
acidic
applescider
and
grapes
are
particularly
present
in
the
aroma
tastes
extremely
tart
with
some
sweetness
granny
smith
apples
and
grapes
stand
out
in
the
flavor
this
is
an
extraordinarily
dry
and
tart
beer
i
have
never
had
anything
thats
similar
to
this
im
quite
intrigued
and
impressed
with
this
style
the
taste
was
a
bit
sour
but
also
dry
best
way
i
can
describe
it
is
it
is
more
like
a
a
very
dry
cider
than
a
beer
but
after
the
intial
shock
on
the
flavour
i
quit
enjoyed
it
i
think
it
could
be
a
very
nice
drink
that
could
be
drunk
anytime
of
the
year
pours
a
slightly
hazy
golden
color
with
a
nice
creamy
white
head
that
just
wont
give
up
huge
tart
and
musty
aroma
musty
hay
smell
with
some
slight
woody
characterisitics
to
it
cheek
puckering
tartness
starts
this
one
off
with
an
apple
and
grape
skin
flavor
to
it
a
nice
fruity
sweetness
is
in
the
back
of
this
brew
and
keeps
a
very
pleasant
balance
extremely
crisp
and
refreshing
this
lightish
bodied
brew
is
an
absolute
pleasure
to
drink
the
only
bad
thing
about
this
was
when
the
bottle
was
empty
and
there
wasnt
anymore
left
to
drink
sampled
some
at
the
cantillon
brewery
in
brussels
the
head
brewer
poured
it
out
of
a
bottle
that
was
laying
in
a
wicker
basket
had
the
color
of
a
chardonay
wine
and
when
you
smelled
it
it
made
your
mouth
water
and
caused
a
little
puckering
the
sample
i
had
was
very
young
less
than
2
months
in
the
bottle
and
was
sweet
enough
to
balance
the
tartness
ended
acidic
on
the
back
of
the
throat
like
a
tart
white
wine
nice
but
only
could
drink
a
small
glass
at
a
time
hazy
peach
color
a
nice
head
with
bigger
carbonation
at
the
edges
smells
a
lot
like
a
chardonney
with
lots
of
yeasty
barn
aromas
wow
this
stuff
is
major
league
astringent
bear
with
me
im
no
gueuze
expert
thats
for
sure
ginger
flavors
lots
of
winelike
character
and
a
sourness
that
just
sucks
your
cheeks
in
then
suddenly
pop
it
finishes
very
clean
and
dry
heres
a
style
i
need
to
do
face
off
comparisons
with
a
fruit
lambic
is
no
preparation
to
be
fair
ill
give
it
a
higher
flavor
score
and
lower
drinkability
its
certainly
everything
ive
heard
gueuze
to
be
and
ill
try
to
think
of
occasions
when
this
would
be
what
i
want
hail
beer
diversity
a
classic
kudos
to
eyechartbrew
for
supplying
this
dirty
whore
of
a
lambic
exceptional
bone
dry
and
slightly
tart
acidic
sourness
very
earthy
aroma
and
impressivly
refreshing
complex
and
dry
from
start
to
finish
definitely
my
style
of
beer
outside
of
bottle
in
area
around
cap
was
covered
in
a
black
crusty
liquid
that
smelled
of
soy
sauce
cork
was
still
in
good
condition
though
when
cork
was
about
halfway
out
we
heard
the
hissing
and
rushed
it
over
to
the
sink
to
protect
the
floor
right
about
the
time
i
got
it
to
the
sink
the
cork
shot
out
attached
to
one
of
those
big
cork
screws
with
the
handles
to
make
it
easier
to
get
the
cork
out
and
it
hit
the
ceiling
im
just
glad
i
had
it
aimed
straight
up
and
not
towards
my
head
or
the
window
the
head
was
huge
but
faded
quickly
and
unevenly
the
scoring
in
the
bottom
of
the
glass
left
a
thick
column
of
tiny
bubbles
coming
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
so
the
head
never
completely
went
away
the
smell
was
a
bit
musty
with
an
aroma
i
have
noticed
with
many
darker
belgian
ales
especially
the
la
trappe
dubbel
and
quadrupel
i
had
thought
that
until
recently
it
was
candy
sugar
but
im
not
sure
if
thats
what
it
is
since
i
dont
know
if
its
used
in
this
beer
in
the
flavor
the
beginning
is
some
maltiness
mustiness
and
a
few
other
flavors
i
dont
recognize
the
finish
is
sour
and
a
fairly
lengthy
aftertaste
is
also
sour
the
sourness
is
the
largest
part
of
the
flavor
profile
but
not
as
much
as
i
had
been
led
to
believe
a
very
interesting
experience
but
it
was
a
little
difficult
to
drink
more
than
a
glass
outstanding
experience
the
pour
alone
was
worth
it
big
bubbles
form
below
tight
ones
popping
causing
volcanolike
eruptions
the
aromas
and
flavors
transport
you
to
a
different
place
drinking
this
beer
is
like
putting
your
tongue
in
the
cobwebstrewn
rafters
above
the
fermenters
and
tasting
its
storied
history
spritzy
tart
sour
funky
bonedry
delicious
not
your
usual
beer
if
you
are
not
prepared
for
the
very
wild
flavors
of
a
cantillon
you
may
go
into
shock
if
on
the
other
hand
you
are
looking
for
a
very
authentic
lambic
this
is
your
man
had
a
glass
of
this
at
the
brewery
in
brussels
cant
get
any
better
than
that
they
served
it
via
lambic
basket
into
my
glass
then
i
closed
my
eyes
and
i
was
in
heaven
for
a
few
min
100
lambic
baby

downright
funky

is

with

definitely
an
acquired
taste
personally
i
love
gueuze
beers
i
have
a
few
older
bottles
and
i
just
havent
gotten
around
to
trying
this
beer
until
someone
was
nice
enough
to
share
a
fresh
one
at

reminded

im
interested
to
see
if
i
like
this
beer
better
when
its
got
some
age
on
it
hops
in
lambic
just
doesnt
really
do
anything
for
me
overall
a
solid
beer
but
as
far
cantillon
beers
go
this
is
one
the
lower
end
of
the
spectrum
lacks
the
complexity
of
other
beers
of
the
style
and
as
far
as
dry
hopped
sours
go
they
seem
to
be
more
on

just
another
fantastic
offering
from
cantillon
from
what
im
aware
of
both
this
one
and
iris
are
hopped
up
lambics
but
i
think
i
prefer
this
one
a
little
more
as
its
a
lighter
lighter
in
body
and
less
bitter
perhaps
the
blending
that
takes
place
in
this
one
that
i
dont
believe
takes
place
in
the
iris
has
smoothed
out
the
rough
edges
a
bit
2014
vintage

very
funky
gueuze
with

from

can

had
last

and
that

was
amazing
and
i
certainly
enjoy
the
2
year

lambic
better
than
the
all
pale

the

seem
to

i

here
to
tell
you
this
over
exceeded
my

very
much

o
not

could
drink
this
often
if
i
could
find
it
overall
great
lambic
blend
with
good
hoppy
touch
to
it
a
really
interesting
beer
i
dont
think
there
is
anything
the
cantillon
family
can
touch
without
it
turning
to
gold
od
ok
definitely
a
letdown
based
on
the
reputation
and
my
experience
with
cantillon
tame
in
all
respects
for
a
beer
from
them
definitely
not
sour
ok
but
certainly
wanted
more
overall
a
really
nice
geuze
i
like
the
impact
of
the
hops
but
it
is
the
funk
that
makes
it
this
was
delightful
not
nearly
as
acidic
as
the
regular
gueuze
it
seems
as
if
the
hops
really
moderated
some
of
that
the
hops
are
very
subdued
i
really
couldnt
detect
them
all
that
much
they
may
have
muted
some
of
the
vinegar
in
the
nose
overall
a
super
enjoyable
beer
one
i
would
absolutely
drink
again
o
very
enjoyable
geuze
that
goes
down
very
well
rereview
18
months
had
this
one
again
from
the
same
november
2012
vintage
poured
into
a
cantillon
stemmed
glass
today
412014
so
a
year
and
a
half
of
age
basically
i
found
this
to
be
significantly
better
than
at
11
months
of
age
the
floral
aspects
have
faded
and
there
is
a
much
more
lemon
zesty
white
vinous
quality
to
the
beer
i
could
be
fooled
into
thinking
this
had
some
white
grapes
especially
accompanied
by
the
oak
and
mustiness
clear
cantillon
barnyard
horseblanket
funk
thats
developed
a
good
bit
in
the
past
few
months
really
good
stuff
especially
as
the
vinous
qualities
seem
to
have
developed
in
this
beer
somehow
d
perhaps
not
the
most
proper
take
on
the
style
it
is
very
tasty
and
does
subtlety
full
justice
this
is
an
excellent
lambic
apparently
straight
2
year
the
differences
between
a
standard
gueueze
are
apparent
a
bit
less
funk
depth
and
south
intensity
but
still
stupidly
quaffable
and
complex
another
must
try
from
cantillon
ofirst
cantillon
gueuze
it
was
tasty
not
as
good
as
the
classic
gueuze
overall
fantastic
ended
up
with
this
when
they
kicked
the
kriek
keg
and
im
glad
it
did
the
highlight
of
the
night
for
me
o
the
nose
is
really
interesting
and
unique
great
stuff
but
the
flavors
dont
really
come
together
at
all
overall
i
smelled
this
brew
more
than
i
drank
it
if
thats
possible
but
its
go
some
incredible
impressive
character
cantillons
only
nonaged
hopped
beer
was
truly
magical
between
the
earthy
hoppy
bitterness
the
intense
acidic
notes
the
complex
funk
and
the
supple
mouthfeel
this
beer
put
me
in
a
state
of
sensory
overload
overall
another
high
quality
offering
from
cantillon
the
least
sour
tasting
beer
ive
had
from
them
but
the
flavor
profile
is
top
notch
overall
seems
as
though
im
continually
impressed
every
time
i
try
a
new
cantillon
beer
and
this
one
is
no
exception
this
is
an
excellent
beer
and
worth
seeking
out
i
dont
think
ive
smiled
this
much
since
getting
a
puppy
as
a
child
come
to
think
of
it
a
few
of
my
happiest
memories
involve
drinking
lambic
under
a
clear
blue
brussels
sky
cantillon
saintgilloise
should
have
stuck
with
its
maiden
name
cuvée
des
champions
because
it
is
in
my
opinion
a
perfect
gueuze
and
one
of
cantillons
finest
offerings
light
body
and
mildly
carbonation
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
but
not
all
that
interesting
i
last
tried
this
out
of
a
bottle
about
two
years
ago
and
remember
more
fresh
hop
character
with
a
nice
lambic
base
so
this
keg
may
have
been
on
the
old
side
o
i
get
it
finally
i
get
the
appeal
of
cantillon
this
is
exceptional
and
titillating
i
would
recommend
it
to
others
overall
this
is
great
im
not
all
that
experienced
with
gueuze
yet
but
this
is
one
of
the
more
approachable
ive
found
so
far
the
sourness
is
balanced
well
with
the
hop
bitterness
and
the
feel
is
creamy
and
crisp
at
the
finish
making
this
absurdly
easy
to
finish
quickly
a
very
nice
gueuze
i
will
gladly
drink
again
especially
on
a
hot
summers
day
like
today
recommended
overall
very
nice
as
usual
with
this
brewery
ill
enjoy
trying
a
well
aged
bottle
of
this
at
some
point
3
5
d
its
definitely
one
of
the
funkier
cantillons
out
there
its
good
but
3f
does
it
so
much
better
still
worth
a
try
o
very
good
quite
drinkable
too
overall
very
good
as
one
would
expect
from
cantillon
but
i
found
the
bitterness
a
bit
jarring
i
may
like
this
beer
more
with
a
bit
more
time
on
it
o
still
relatively
young
so
i
assume
this
may
become
more
dry
over
time
but
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
gueuze
overall
pretty
nice
one
of
the
more
balanced
gueuzes
out
there
probably
one
of
the
nicest
additions
of
funk
ive
tasted
so
incredibly
funky
while
remaining
drinkable
and
free
from
anything
offensive
or
offputting
a
nice
meshing
of
flavors
with
some
fruits
and
a
light
yet
assertive
tartness
that
keeps
you
coming
back
for
more
if
this
were
more
easily
available
it
would
be
the
goto
brew
to
introduce
someone
to
the
world
of
unabashed
funk
d
fantastic
balance
and
complexity
the
hops
are
a
great
addition
a
twist
on
the
usual
gueuze
personally
im
more
fond
of
a
more
tart
gueuze
than
a
hoppy
one
however
theres
little
doubt
that
this
is
fun
to
drink
d
this
one
goes
down
very
easily
given
that
this
beer
was
not
overly
tart
could
be
a
great
session
beer
this
poured
out
as
a
hazy
yellowish
orange
color
the
head
is
decent
looking
thin
retention
with
a
pretty
good
lacing
the
smell
of
the
beer
gives
off
a
good
amount
of
funk
along
with
grassy
malt
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
along
the
lines
of
a
gueuze
and
a
pilsner
tart
and
slightly
sour
some
grains
and
wheat
hidden
in
the
faith
distance
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
nicely
carbonated
and
drinkable
overall
this
beer
is
really
quite
nice
looks
like
clover
honey
hazy
and
golden
not
much
head
funky
classic
lambic
aroma
with
lots
of
plasticky
medicinal
notes
ripe
pears
dried
apricot
a
faint
hint
of
lychee
and
pleasant
grassy
hops
lipsmackingly
puckeringly
acidic
and
very
refreshing
sour
apple
sourdough
white
grapefruit
really
juicy
relentlessly
sour
but
very
moreish
and
mouthwatering
theres
a
touch
of
passionfruit
and
this
intriguing
violetlike
floral
quality
in
the
finish
as
well
not
quite
easy
drinking
on
account
of
its
acidity
but
really
very
delicious
o
a
very
fruity
geuze
more
on
the
bright
rather
than
earthy
side
thanks
to
the
brett
and
the
dry
hopping
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
pours
a
lightly
hazy
golden
with
a
finger
of
what
head
that
faded
into
a
good
longlasting
collar
im
getting
a
lot
of
stone
fruits
on
the
nose
and
palate
including
apricot
and
peach
the
taste
is
full
of
more
citrus
notes
than
the
nose
let
on
earthy
spice
and
a
bit
of
yeasty
funk
balance
out
the
fruit
and
lend
some
tartness
to
the
mouthfeel
the
finish
is
very
dry
and
im
getting
some
citrus
rind
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
low
carbonation
tart
dry
mouthfeel
medium
body
another
great
cantillon
i
need
to
get
my
hand
on
some
of
this
stuff
thanks
again
russ
a
wonderful
lambic
the
dry
hopping
adds
a
nice
note
and
the
balance
of
yeast
flavours
in
this
one
are
great
o
accomplished
beer
and
one
of
my
favorites
in
the
cantillon
pantheon
the
hops
and
the
lambic
work
for
me
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
albeit
being
nothing
like
i
was
expecting
i
have
not
had
a
cantillon
with
this
much
hop
character
but
it
was
a
nice
chance
of
pace
there
is
the
typical
cantillon
funk
which
cannot
be
replicated
to
complement
the
dry
hops
and
create
a
unique
yet
enjoyable
experience
appearance
is
cloudy
orange
with
a
short
dense
head
that
doesnt
last
long
nose
is
funky
tons
of
sourdough
lemon
and
a
slight
hint
towards
a
sulphuric
character
notes
of
hay
and
dry
oak
very
complex
on
the
nose
taste
starts
funky
with
lemon
bready
sourdough
character
drying
tart
character
towards
the
end
some
grape
skin
in
there
as
well
mouthfeel
is
dry
and
highly
carbonated
overall
a
very
complex
and
unique
brew
o
very
drinkable
and
tasty
not
that
complex
but
very
well
balanced
it
could
have
a
big
nose
and
taste
but
it
is
really
a
treat
easy
drinking
yummy
beer
definitely
not
as
inyourface
as
most
cantillons
but
that
is
the
appeal
for
this
beer
in
my
opinion
this
is
probably
the
smoothest
easiest
drinking
beer
ive
had
from
them
yet
it
doesnt
sacrifice
their
signature
flavor
profile
to
do
so
awesome
stuff
similar
to
the
classic
gueuze
but
a
bit
toned
down
with
sourness
and
funk
also
somewhat
of
a
hop
feel
with
bitterness
and
an
herbal
hint
solid
and
very
drinkable
o
overall
while
this
is
a
tasty
beer
its
possibly
my
least
favourite
cantillon
for
me
it
just
lacks
the
complexity
of
others
cheers
overall
another
stellar
beer
from
cantillon
overall
cuvee
st
gilloise
is
a
solid
sour
but
it
seems
to
lack
the
power
and
complexity
of
other
beers
from
cantillon
overall
excellent
maybe
lacking
in
complexity
but
the
flavors
it
has
are
phenomenal
a
somewhat
dull
orange
underneath
a
thin
layer
of
foam
the
head
was
creamy
and
long
lasting
never
fully
receding
the
nose
is
full
of
tart
apple
leather
tobacco
cider
vinegar
and
white
grape
skins
soft
and
complex
with
equal
parts
sweet
and
tart
the
tartness
leaps
onto
the
palate
with
a
punch
of
flavor
first
it
was
a
good
amount
of
earthy
tones
then
white
grapes
tobacco
green
apples
cider
vinegar
sea
salt
aged
cheese
and
a
light
old
oak
flavor
burst
onto
the
palate
holy
complexity
just
waves
of
flavor
on
top
of
a
bed
of
sour
light
to
medium
body
low
carbonation
with
a
sharp
acidity
this
is
a
damn
fine
gueuze
with
a
tremendous
amount
of
complexity
it
could
take
days
to
truly
break
down
everything
going
on
big
thanks
goes
out
to
msquared2
for
sharing
this
one
during
a
fair
sized
cantillon
tasting
2011
vintage
served
from
bottle
into
a
cantillon
balloon
poured
fluorescent
orange
with
a
minimal
white
head
maintained
excellent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
fruit
fruit
hop
funk
tart
and
herbal
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
fruit
fruit
hop
funk
wood
sour
spice
and
herbal
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
high
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
good
brew
the
hop
character
on
this
one
really
added
a
very
unique
touch
to
this
style
that
i
never
would
have
thought
possible
the
fruit
hoppiness
really
blended
quite
well
with
this
brew
and
kept
me
interested
after
each
sip
this
could
be
a
good
gateway
for
some
who
like
fruity
hops
and
want
to
get
into
sours
will
be
interesting
to
see
what
some
age
does
to
this
brew
as
the
hops
start
to
fade
but
as
is
this
is
still
a
very
solid
brew
o
more
muted
but
i
love
the
applepear
flavors
that
dominate
ogreat
beer
that
is
a
nice
change
of
pace
for
cantillon
i
really
like
the
hop
character
that
st
gilloise
and
cuvée
des
champions
have
its
a
nice
compliment
to
the
lambic
still
prefer
cuvée
des
champions
more
than
st
gilloise
but
both
are
awesome
overall
this
has
to
be
the
most
refined
gueuze
ive
had
to
date
it
might
not
have
been
the
most
memorable
due
to
its
lower
alcohol
and
smoother
taste
yet
i
think
i
would
say
that
it
was
the
finest
crafted
ive
had
yet
i
sort
of
think
of
this
as
the
gold
standard
for
gueuzes
now
o
another
great
gueuze
from
cantillon
though
i
preferred
classic
and
monks
to
this
one
cantillon
delivers
once
again
a
superior
gueuze
that
takes
the
palate
in
all
sorts
of
directions
at
once
as
complex
as
the
beer
is
so
many
flavors
reveal
at
once
that
is
seems
to
confuse
the
nose
and
palate
as
much
as
it
satisfies
them
its
akin
to
that
picasso
thats
awe
inspiring
in
the
gallery
but
you
dont
want
hanging
in
your
home
i
enjoyed
this
one
quite
a
bit
the
aroma
didnt
set
the
bar
high
but
the
taste
came
through
cantillon
does
it
once
again
d
really
good
offering
from
cantillon
this
has
a
nice
combination
of
funk
and
gueze
flavors
not
as
extremely
sour
as
some
of
their
other
offerings
which
makes
it
more
drinkable
in
my
book
m
bone
dry
with
pinpoint
carbonation
hugely
refreshing
and
very
easy
to
drink
despite
the
considerable
acidity
another
awesome
offering
from
cantillon
pours
a
clear
honey
orange
with
an
orangewhite
head
that
settles
to
a
thin
cap
on
top
of
the
beer
foamy
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
sour
tart
and
funky
with
some
grain
and
herbal
hop
aromas
taste
is
exactly
the
same
with
a
slight
bitterness
on
the
finish
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
great
gueuze
with
a
nice
hoppy
presence
o
a
really
excellent
beer
this
is
the
only
cantillon
gueuze
ive
had
besides
their
regular
gueuze
100
and
i
definitely
enjoyed
this
one
just
as
much
if
not
more
tight

nice

d
i
really
enjoyed
this
vintage
ive
had
mixed
success
with
cuvée
des
champions
in
the
past
but
the
bottles
ive
had
most
recently
have
ranged
from
very
good
to
stellar
im
looking
forward
to
the
bottle
i
have
in
the
cellar
on
tap
at
cantillon
poured
into
a
small
tulip
white
head
medium
retention
atop
a
light
gold

aroma
of
peach

andsome
balsamic
taste

tart
apricot
and
grapefruit
quite
mouthtongue
puckering

is
much
happier
than
the
other
cantillon
beers
ive
had
which
is
really
nice
with
the
tart
cantillon
funk
taste
is
classic
cantillon
tart
and
funk
a
bit
fruity
with
a
dry
finish
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
dry
very
good
beer
this
is
the
cuvee
saint
gilloise
and
a
different
beer
not
sure
why
they
are
put
together
in
one
on
here
pour
is
a
transparent
golden
peach
with
a
very
loose
small
bubbled
white
head
the
nose
has
a
lightly
dusty
funk
cob
web
hint
of
sea
salt
and
some
zesty
yeast
notes
there
are
some
golden
fruits
behind
and
a
strong
hp
punch
of
juicy
citrus
and
floral
hops
the
taste
seems
brighter
and
more
balanced
very
dusty
funk
lemon
rind
and
a
bit
of
sour
peach
there
is
a
fair
bit
of
lingering
sourness
citrus
hops
and
an
assertive
bitterness
with
just
a
light
touch
of
heat
medium
body
very
active
and
granular
on
the
palate
high
carb
and
fairly
dry
this
is
starting
to
open
up
in
flavor
and
has
an
interesting
and
awesome
hop
presence
and
bitterness
but
not
quite
balanced
and
integrated
enough
to
be
great
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
yellow
color
with
a
thin
white
head
the
smell
is
slightly
funky
tart
and
a
little
hop
presence
the
flavor
is
sour
but
not
overly
sour
with
a
little
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
dry
and
well
carbed
overall
this
is
a
a
good
gueuze
not
a
great
one
pours
a
light
orangegold
with
a
finger
or
so
of
bright
white
head
carbonation
isnt
outstanding
here
but
theres
some
lace
left
in
addition
to
a
bit
of
head
retention
nose
was
prominent
as
soon
as
i
popped
the
cork
tons
of
lemon
and
sour
green
apple
a
hell
of
a
lot
of
funk
white
vinegar
and
a
load
of
acetic
acid
love
the
funk
and
some
semblance
of
barrel
here
taste
wasnt
as
tart
as
i
had
expected
still
more
raw
green
apple
and
pear
cantiloon
funk
a
touch
of
barrel
and
notable
acetic
acidity
some
interesting
sweetness
midpalate
but
a
tart
bite
finishes
off
the
palate
this
gets
more
and
more
complex
with
each
sip
each
revealing
the
characteristics
of
this
gueuze
in
a
different
tone
quite
a
light
body
with
a
fairly
modest
carbonation
not
as
effervescent
and
zippy
as
some
others
but
still
works
well
for
the
drinkability
still
very
nice
and
something
that
i
wish
i
couldve
enjoyed
on
a
warmer
day
a
nice
gueuze
thanks
fred
o
a
very
enjoyable
birthday
gift
that
i
was
thankful
to
share
with
a
wonderful
group
of
bas
i
would
seek
this
out
if
you
have
not
already
imo
i
think
this
is
a
great
introductory
beer
to
the
style
of
gueuze
im
still
a
rookie
in
the
world
of
lambics
but
slowly
im
learning
what
i
like
thanks
adam
for
bring
this
by
overall
nice
and
refreshing
not
too
sour
not
too
complex
but
easy
to
drink
the
flavor
has
bits
of
wood
w
lemony
sour
and
other
funk
aspectsthere
is
mild
citrus
rind
and
slight
bitter
herb
w
a
hint
of
white
pepper
and
pineapple
melon
w
a
hint
of
grassy
astringency
the
tropical
fruit
presence
goes
well
w
the
oak
in
the
finish
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
pretty
great
gueuze
i
enjoyed
other
for
its
complexity
and
the
level
of
sourness
this
is
pretty
drinkable
and
brings
a
nice
amount
of
oak
from
the
barrel
and
funkiness
to
the
experience
this
is
a
medium
to
light
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
level
of
carbonation
there
is
seemingly
no
alcohol
inclusion
this
is
a
type
of
brew
that
is
complex
enough
tht
you
can
sit
and
ponder
over
it
for
a
long
time
but
it
is
easy
drinking
enough
that
you
could
take
down
a
whole
bottle
effortlessly
pleasantly
tart
without
going
overboard
as
far
as
the
geuze
style
goes
this
is
not
harsh
at
all
very
well
rounded
and
enjoyable
i
will
be
seeking
more
of
this
out
d
its
an
interesting
mix
but
i
dont
find
cuvée
des
champions
quite
as
purposeful
as
classic
wouldnt
say
no
to
another
tasting
but
wouldnt
really
seek
it
out
either
overall
a
fantastic
beer
from
cantillon
a
great
gueuze
and
would
love
to
try
this
again
appearance
light
bodied
high
carbonation
very
sprizty
on
the
palate
finish
is
drying
and
very
refreshing
overall
a
very
solid
gueuze
complex
not
overly
sour
not
necessarily
a
good
or
a
bad
thing
for
me
and
nice
hop
character
despite
the
funkiness
in
the
nose
and
the
sour
on
the
tongue
this
really
has
a
refreshing
edge
to
it
light
hopping
shares
some
of
the
apricot
it
seems
from
fou
fune
throw
in
a
little
hay
and
grassy
notes
and
you
have
a
complex
but
clean
and
enjoyable
gueuze
that
is
balanced
throughout
from
the
first
sip
the
fuller
body
and
dryhopped
juiciness
makes
this
a
pretty
interesting
beer
and
it
works
quite
well
o
a
really
interesting
take
on
gueuze
i
love
mixing
hoppy
dipas
and
ipas
with
lambic
and
this
is
not
quite
what
i
was
expecting
in
terms
of
hop
profiles
on
the
nose
it
was
much
more
interesting
this
way
i
really
enjoyed
how
the
hops
played
with
the
barnyard
and
sour
notes
o
great
beer
albeit
a
bit
heavy
handed
on
the
tart
with
not
much
on
the
funk
overall
this
was
one
of
the
first
gueuzes
that
i
was
able
to
really
get
into
and
now
i
think
i
am
an
addict
of
the
style
so
ill
just
keep
drinking
this
year
after
year
then
save
some
for
a
short
vertical
in
the
future
overall
a
great
beer
very
complex
tasty
flavors
and
excellent
mouth
feel
as
to
be
expected
from
cantillon
this
beer
is
delicious
o
i
prefer
the
cantillon
classic
gueuze
to
this
but
that
could
be
because
of
the
age
at
around
12
years
old
i
have
a
feeling
this
would
be
in
my
sweet
spot
that
isnt
to
say
this
is
a
bad
beer
its
an
excellent
example
of
the
quality
one
can
expect
from
cantillon
albeit
a
little
young
45
i
have
an
07
in
the
cellar
that
im
holding
for
the
next
philly
sports
championship
hopefully
will
not
have
to
cellar
much
longer
as
im
not
sure
it
will
hold
up
well
medium
body
nice
carbonation
lingering
and
dry
on
the
tongue
this
was
a
bit
of
a
surprise
beer
for
me
and
i
was
definitely
into
the
addition
of
fresh
hops
amidst
the
already
fantastic
cantillon
funkysour
flavors
hands
down
my
favorite
beer
of
the
pizza
port
belgian
beer
festival
d
cantillon
never
disappoints
yet
another
solid
to
great
gueuze
from
their
lineup
definitely
will
only
get
better
with
some
more
time
since
the
dry
hopping
is
definitely
detectable
great
stuff
awesome
beer
not
very
musty
or
earthy
brett
is
big
on
the
nose
but
acidity
rules
the
palate
seems
like
a
fresher
batch
m
spritzy
and
lighter
in
body
good
tartness
on
draft
at
beer
revolution
pours
a
hazy
light
amber
with
a
a
two
finger
fluffly
white
head
that
has
good
retention
and
leaves
a
small
amount
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
a
decent
earthiness
funky
brett
hay
and
some
lemon
tartness
the
taste
has
the
same
earthiness
as
the
aroma
medium
tartness
some
wheat
hay
lemon
the
finish
has
a
strong
brett
funkiness
as
well
as
a
lingering
bitterness
that
is
quite
unique
among
the
gueuzes
ive
had
medium
body
medium
carbonation
awesome
beer
drink
a
very
well
done
beer
the
classic
gueuze
is
hard
to
do
and
cantillon
does
it
very
well
i
would
come
back
to
this
anyday
o
i
think
i
still
prefer
regular
cantillon
gueuze
but
this
was
really
quite
good
minimal
white
head
a
wee
bit
of
lacing
over
straw
yellow
a
bit
opaque
body
with
no
visible
carbonation
lemony
esters
and
salt
dominate
the
nose
some
barnyard
aromas
a
faint
bit
of
floral
hops
taste
is
more
sour
than
tart
lemony
and
salty
a
bit
of
hayish
funk
lingering
dry
finish
fairly
light
mouthfeel
light
and
refreshing
a
very
unique
beer
not
really
my
cup
of
tea
err
gueuze
but
i
certainly
see
what
the
buzz
is
about
certainly
in
the
pantheon
of
beers
for
this
difficult
to
capture
style
glad
i
was
able
to
try
this
o
very
enjoyable
and
very
easy
to
drink
i
had
two
of
these
and
my
fiancee
had
another
a
perfect
beer
for
the
summer
really
enjoyed
this
one
ontap
much
more
then
from
the
bottle
recommend
o
overall
i
really
liked
this
one
it
wasnt
an
over
the
top
sour
like
some
of
the
other
cantillon
offerings
i
have
had
and
it
really
hit
the
spot
on
this
hot
afternoon
smooth
and
well
balanced
a
refreshing
carbonation
level
overall
a
very
smooth
gueuze
not
too
extreme
or
overwhelming
in
the
funk
or
sour
departments
just
a
nice
refreshing
sour
love
ending
a
meal
with
a
cantillon
lambic
yeah
just
zesty
tart
and
bitter
goodness
o
once
again
cantillon
has
managed
to
make
my
jaw
fall
to
the
floor
overall
a
great
gueuze
from
cantillon
this
one
is
dry
hopped
but
i
did
not
pick
up
any
of
the
dry
hopping
which
is
most
likely
due
to
the
age
of
the
beer
being
bottled
1042010
id
definitely
recommend
this
to
anyone
looking
for
an
acidic
gueuze
that
retains
its
drinkability
not
perfect
but
definitely
a
solid
example
of
the
style
cuvee
des
chamions
pours
a
mildly
hazy
orange
lightening
to
tangerine
when
backlit
theres
a
thin
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
into
nothing
the
nose
is
a
bit
delicate
and
its
largely
a
blend
of
sweet
pale
fruits
apricots
and
peaches
and
woody
oak
notes
theres
a
faint
tart
aroma
present
as
well
the
sour
notes
noticeably
increase
in
intensity
in
the
taste
the
resulting
balance
between
sweetness
barrel
notes
and
acidity
is
just
about
perfect
its
still
not
nearly
as
aggressively
tart
as
some
of
the
other
cantillon
offerings
ive
had
but
that
only
allows
the
other
flavors
to
really
shine
through
the
body
is
as
dry
and
light
as
id
anticipate
from
a
5
brew
that
probably
has
little
in
the
way
of
residual
sugars
but
the
carbonation
is
a
pleasant
surprise
it
doesnt
really
come
alive
until
mid
palate
but
when
it
does
a
torrent
of
tiny
bubbles
appear
and
liven
the
beer
up
cuvee
des
champions
maybe
isnt
as
challenging
as
cantillons
other
beers
in
terms
of
how
much
the
wild
yeast
and
bacteria
have
taken
over
but
its
subtle
and
artfully
balanced
i
imagine
it
would
be
accessible
to
someone
new
to
sourswild
ales
but
at
the
same
time
still
has
more
than
enough
depth
to
please
a
seasoned
drinker
my
favorite
sour
to
date
mouthfeel
was
nicely
prickly
on
the
tongue
lightbodied
and
generously
carbonated
throughout
so
glad
to
have
been
able
to
try
this
cantillon
offering
well
worth
being
sought
after
o
i
feel
like
a
lucky
man
today
i
would
rank
this
as
an
exceptional
gueuze
the
hops
really
pushed
it
up
a
notch
overall
a
very
good
beer
that
i
was
glad
to
try
on
tap
as
ive
only
had
cantillon
beers
in
bottles
o
the
beer
is
relatively
easy
to
drink
for
the
style
because
although
the
sourness
is
strong
it
does
not
overpower
your
palate
onice
offering
would
like
to
try
again
pours
a
nice

with
a
decent
amount
of
white

smells

and
sour
lots
of
hops
and
sweet
sourness
tastes
sweet
with
a
mild

the
best

ever
every

had

really

that
was
easy
enough
to
drink
and
had
a
great

good
stuff
would
like
more
o
the
beer
was
quite
impressive
very
delicious

and
a

that
help
the
tartness
be
a
compliment
and
not
so
in
your
face
96
points
this
is
a
very
nice
lambic
it
has
a
great
deal
of
flavor
and
a
nice
sourness
there
is
a
lot
of
carbonation
overall
this
was
one
of
cantillons
more
interesting
beers
however
im
not
sure
its
one
of
my
favorites
made
by
them
still
the
hops
add
a
nice
dimension
making
this
well
worth
a
shot
o
clearly
one
of
the
favorites
among
all
the
wildssours
tried
and
rightly
so
wonderfully
ripe
and
pungent
juicy
and
lasting
great
depth
sure
its
what
cantillon
is
known
for
but
its
always
nice
to
be
reminded
of
why
they
are
arguably
the
best
at
what
they
do
a
pleasure
to
drink
and
to
share
among
friends
mouth
is
highly
carbonated
the
high
carbonation
and
signature
cantillon
dryness
makes
this
a
crisp
drinkable
beer
a
very
approachable
and
enjoyable
lambic
o
this
dry
hopped
unbelnded
lambic
is
an
extremely
refreshing
brew
which
would
be
perfect
on
a
warm
summer
night
also
paired
well
with
the
tuna
crudo
and
sweet
breads
i
ordered
definitly
the
best

ive
tried
highly
recommended

carbonation
pretty
dry
drinkability
is
pretty
good
but
the
bitter

keeps
you
from
sippin
too
fast
o
overall
i
thought
this
was
another
great
beer
from
cantillon
i
really
liked
the
smell
and
enjoyed
the
hops
mixing
with
the
classic
cantillon
gueuze
smell
the
taste
was
good
though
slightly
too
mch
vinegar
none
the
less
i
had
no
problem
finishing
a
375ml
bottle
of
this
and
glad
i
have
another
bottle
of
it
very
different
very
good
easier
to
drink
than
most
other
cantillons
as
the
acidity
levels
seem
to
be
cut
down
significantly
by
the
dry
hopping
refreshing
spritzy
and
delicious
im
glad
to
have
tried
this
and
to
share
it
with
friends
overall
this
is
yet
another
top
quality
offering
from
the
best
brewery
in
the
world
if
you
see
some
pick
it
up

what

ran

spotted

surprising
and
lemon

this
is

and
delicate
my
favorite
cantillon

d
very
quaffable
and
the
fruity
aspects
make
it
very
easy
to
casually
sip
throughout
the
day
drinkability
is
great
this
may
be
one
of
the
most
balanced
cantillons
ive
had
not
overpowering
in
any

great
sour

good

very

anywhere
im
very
glad
i
got
to
try
it
keep
the

coming
d
low
and
the
high

adds
insult
to
injury
overall
a
decent
cantillion
much
more

than
others
which
is
why
i
would
have
to
limit
myself
to
this

excellent
beer
like
it
better
than
iris
which
i
consider
to
be

d
surprisingly
moderate
for

unique
in

probably
will
be
my
only
one
but
it
is
well
worth

drinkable

sacrificing
purity
probably
the
best
place
to
start
with
the
style
if
you
are
unaccustomed
to
traditional
lambic
this
beer
appears
a
hazy
orange

a
little
head
that
fades
rather
quickly
the
beer
smells
spicy
funky
and
noticeably
more
subtly
sour
than
i
expected
from
a
cantillon
of
course
i
did
drink
this
side
by
side
with
fou
fonne
which
was
incredibly
tart
i
found
this
to
be
an
enjoyable
beer
but
it
lacked
the
depth
andor
complexity
that
cantillon
beers
usually
have
in
spades
this
was
a
plain
decent
offering
from
a
brewery
that
i
hold
in
the
highest
esteem

aroma
is
a
my
favorite
part
of
the
beer
a
complex
and
potent
blend
of
funk
lemon
zest
yeast
must
oak
and
mild
hoppiness
flavor
is
a
little
bit
of
a
letdown
from
the
nose
and
just
general
expectations
of
cantillon
flavor
is
a
clean
dry
punch
of
zesty
lemon
mild
funk
apple
and
earthy
dry
hops
body
is
medium
thick
with
sparkling
fine
carbonation
nothing
too
remarkable
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
another
excellent
offering
but
not
the
best
cantillon
its
lively
especially
off
the
tap
very
refreshing
a
little
bit
of
everything
light
bodied
and
dry
finishing
very
easy
to
drink
but
at
nine
bucks
a
flute
i
cant
drink
a
bunch
i
wish
i
could
of
had
more
and
i
will
drinkability
is
high
a
very
nice
refreshing
beer
basically
a
gueze
would
love
to
try
this
fresh
to
enjoy
the
dry
hopping
more
fully
but
after
only
having
the
pleasure
of
enjoying
this
once
before
thx
frank
im
just
happy
to
have
gotten
my
hands
on
a
bottle
for
myself
d
this
stuff
is
the
cats
pajamas
a
very
refreshing
offering
from
cantillon
the
south
philadelphia
taproom
followed
by
a
phillies
game
at
citizens
park
is
bound
to
bring
a
smile
this
fine
lambic
came
to
the
table
with
a
little
head
and
a
whole
lot
of
attitude
just
a
bit
cloudy
pale
yellow
with
fine
carbonation
and
an
earthy
breadlike
aroma
gave
way
to
a
lemony
scent
and
a
definitely
bold
lemon
crisp
first
taste
the
flavor
is
exciting
with
every
sip
to
me
a
really
distinctive
quality
there
is
a
beautiful
balance
between
the
hops
and
the
rest
of
the
broad
gamut
of
flavors
in
this
complex
aged
lambic
the
cantillon
st
gilloise
is
the
definition
of
fresh
despite
its
years
in
a
cask
definitely
a
tart
one
but
in
a
much
more
manageable
way
then
a
number
of
other
offerings
from
this
brewery
the
two
years
spent
in
oak
isnt
overtly
noticeable
but
must
contribute
to
a
certain
degree
to
the
softer
smoother
nature
nice
and
drinkable
with
the
usual
caveats
and
now
with
a
hoppiness
quotient
to
boot
a
sassy
flavour
contrast
to
some
nice
homemade
cupcakes
thanks
babe
my
first
unblended
lambic
and
lo
and
behold
its
on
draught
at
the
ck
these
guys
know
what
theyre
doin
i
tell
you
what
it
pours
a
cloudy
pale
straw
thats
suffocated
for
a
while
by
a
tall
thick
white
froth
once
this
head
dies
down
the
smell
is
detected
a
good
amount
of
funk
wet
hay
cobwebs
and
a
rather
tart
vineyard
of
white
grapes
im
not
sure
what
to
expect
after
that
whiff
the
taste
is
composed
of
sour
apple
tart
white
grapes
yeast
you
know
the
taste
bread
lemongrass
and
that
nice
citrus
combo
of
lemon
and
lime
that
5050
and
squirt
managed
to
mimic
so
well
in
the
soda
world
while
puckering
somewhat
my
mouth
determines
a
light
body
with
an
active
but
smallbubbled
carbonation
and
a
dry
finish
im
intrigued
to
the
point
that
i
want
more
of
these
unblended
beauties
luckily
ones
in
my
fridge
right
now
d
really
enjoyable
kicking
myself
for
not
stocking
up
when
i
had
the
chance
months
ago
if
you
see
this
on
the
shelves
buy
two
one
for
you
and
bm
me
to
trade
the
other
pouring
a
hazy
orange
with
a
thin
white
head
that
recedes
too
quick
this
looks
decent
imo
cantillon
beers
look
better
out
of
the
bottle
the
last
vintage
of
champions
was
a
screamingly
good
beer
and
this
2010
vintage
is
close
the
dry
hop
character
is
immediately
noticeable
bright
vibrant
earthy
lemony
quite
old
world
in
character
behind
that
lies
a
gentle
cantillon
funk
with
the
usual
suspects
grassy
barnyard
and
a
little
stilton
cheese
nothing
like
a
wet
dog
or
horseblanket
though
refreshing
the
palate
opens
bright
and
vast
with
moderate
acidity
with
lemons
and
a
touch
more
vinegar
than
i
remember
this
beer
having
the
hop
character
is
quite
pronounced
reminding
me
of
a
good
grassy
pils
great
balance
drying
and
lemony
on
the
finish
this
is
great
stuff
maybe
a
touch
overcarbonated
i
also
get
a
light
aspirin
character
all
told
a
beautiful
beer
while
this
might
be
a
weaker
vintage
i
look
forward
to
meeting
jean
van
roy
in
a
couple
of
days

huge
thanks
to
cristian
for
sending
me
this
bottle
d
very
good
beer
by
cantillon
but
not
my
favorite
from
them
too
expensive
for
what
it
is
at
35
bucks
the
iris
comes
close
to
the
overall
characteristic
and
is
almost
half
the
price
of
this
one
drinkability
very
drinkable
not
my
favorite
cantillon
but
not
one
to
turn
down
either
d
very
nice
after
this
id
love
to
try
a
fruitless
wild
ale
gueuze
etc
that
had
been
freshly
dryhopped
with
something
like
amarillo
the
beer
is
quite
unique
and
interesting
the
aroma
is
quite
similar
to
orval
with
its
characteristic
blend
of
hoppiness
and
constrained
brett
funkiness
there
is
an
astringent
bitterness
from
the
hops
which
is
made
more
acute
by
the
lambic
sourness
think
grapefruit
pith
soaked
in
tea
overall
a
much
stronger
hop
effect
than
iris
an
interesting
experiment
and
a
true
delight
to
try
unfortunately
but
unsurprisingly
this
limited
release
was
already
sold
out
within
the
day
and
we
could
not
bring
a
bottle
home
jean
van
roy
may
now
call
this
beer
cuvée
stgilloise
because
the
soccer
team
for
which
he
brewed
it
is
no
longer
on
top
but
if
cantillon
brews
you
a
beer
youre
always
a
champion
in
my
book
great
beer
overall
id
like
to
see
cantillon
make
more
forays
into
the
hopping
arena
although
they
should
use
some
darker
bottles
if
theyre
going
to
do
that
or
the
beers
could
become
major
skunkoramas
a
cantillon
ipa
sounds
amazing
2009
vintage
the
beer
pours
a
murky
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
tart
lemon
with
some
oak
and
earthy
qualities
the
flavor
is
heavy
on
the
lemon
tartness
with
some
oak
notes
there
is
not
as
much
funk
as
i
was
expecting
the
beer
is
very
acidic
and
is
very
very
dry
which
forces
you
to
drink
more
and
more
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
d
this
is
delicious
it
really
gets
good
when
it
gets
near
room
temperature
expensive
but
where
else
am
i
going
to
get
to
try
this
the
beer
displays
tangy
citric
acidity
light
body
and
sticky
texture
this
lambic
is
extremely
wellbalanced
and
the
hops
just
serve
to
enhance
the
dryness
and
the
flavors
already
in
the
beer
i
will
certainly
seek
this
out
again
thanks
to
nightbrew
for
opening
yet
another
stellar
cantillon
brew
overall
a
pretty
good
geuze
d
i
dont
really
know
what
else
to
say
about
this
beer
im
loving
the
taste
of
this
one
im
the
type
of
person
that
will
drink
sour
after
sour
and
dont
see
any
problem
in
drinking
this
750ml
myself
tonight
worth
finding
to
try
d
easy
to
finish
and
left
me
wishing
i
had
some
more
nice
and
sessionable
without
being
too
sour
to
make
an
entire
bottle
a
chore
check
this
one
out
d
darn
good
man
cantillon
does
no
wrong
d
light
and
refreshing
extremely
delicious
look
forward
to
getting
more
into
the
world
of
lambics
and
guezes
750ml
bottle
corked
and
capped
brewed
january
2007
bottled
may
2009
purchased
in
columbus
for
17
99
after
consuming
a
disappointing
fantome
noel
this
beer
turned
out
to
be
a
real
treat
it
pours
light
straw
color
clear
in
the
first
glass
and
progressively
hazier
with
subsequent
pours
due
to
sediments
with
a
thin
wet
foam
the
aroma
is
classic
barnyard
funk
but
with
a
nice
citrus
edge
lemons
even
moreso
than
in
the
lou
pepe
gueuze
i
had
last
night
the
taste
starts
sour
and
ends
with
a
crisp
tart
bite
and
aftertaste
of
sour
lemon
juice
maybe
a
little
grape
too
wow
this
is
easy
to
drink
of
course
you
have
to
like
sour
beers
to
agree
with
this
sentiment
i
have
only
seen
this
for
sale
once
in
my
area
and
bought
it
immediately
ill
do
the
same
if
i
see
it
again
in
the
future
an
outstanding
display
of
quality
personally
i
think
its
one
of
cantillons
more
accessible
brews
and
almost
sessionable
for
the
style
wish
i
would
see
it
more
often
overall
this
is
one
of
the
best
lambics
ive
had
in
a
while
the
green
appleyness
almost
rivals
that
of
ithaca
brute
almost
cant
wait
to
see
how
this
does
with
some
age
the
drinkability
is
downright
amazing
right
now
certainly
one
of
the
best
lambics
on
shelves
great
great
beer
plenty
of
funky
flavors
sourness
and
tartness
here
though
the
dry
hopping
really
adds
a
unique
depth
of
flavor
all
in
all
a
a
great
beer
that
should
not
be
missed
one
of
my
favorites
750ml
bottle
served
in
my
allagash
tulip
poured
an
orangegold
with
a
quarter
inch
bright
white
head
with
a
slightly
hazy
clarity
nose
was
citrus
cork
and
some
french
oak
taste
was
citrus
and
a
little
woody
mouthfeel
was
mediumlight
with
some
tartness
upfront
and
a
consistent
background
effervescence
tartness
stimulates
the
salivary
glands
in
the
cheeks
towards
the
latter
half
before
culminating
in
a
slightly
dry
finish
nice
sour
not
over
the
top
and
really
quite
drinkable
for
the
style
interesting
not
particularly
drinkable
well
carbonated
particularly
considering
the
style
despite
not
completely
falling
in
love
with
how
this
sits
on
the
tongue
its
beauty
its
jawdropping
aroma
and
the
simple
drinkability
of
it
make
it
an
instant
favorite
that
id
like
to
buy
in
quantity
for
those
times
when
the
mood
for
a
sour
hits
but
im
not
looking
for
something
overthetop
d
rather
drinkable
but
this
one
tastes
more
like
a
sour
than
anything
else
building
of
bitterness
in
the
end
takes
away
from
overall
enjoyment
though
very
interesting
unique
and
enjoyable
d
low
abv
and
tasty
but
something
in
there
that
doesnt
make
me
continue
to
reach
for
the
glass
flavor
is
funk
and
lots
of
it
theres
just
a
hit
of
hops
at
the
very
end
of
each
sip
nice
and
different
touch
cant
believe
how
funky
this
is
cant
wait
to
see
what
some
age
will
do
to
this
beer
i
could
drink
lots
of
this
cantillon
just
rules
the
roost
doverall
and
excellent
beer
i
have
a
feeling
that
after
a
year
or
so
this
beer
could
score
some
5s
nice
complexity
of
flavors
medium
body
very
nice
refreshing
a
nice
small
but
complex
beer
here
overall
it
was
very
solid
this
was
just
amazing
crisp
and
clean
and
really
just
incredibly
drinkable
i
was
really
very
pleased
and
think
this
one
needs
a
bit
more
attention
one
of
the
light
of
the
cantillon
brews
and
worth
every
penny
d
high
marks
for
this
could
put
a
whole
bottle
away
on
my
own
if
i
didnt
have
to
work
in
the
am
if
you
are
looking
for
that
classic
cantillon
sharpness
that
will
make
you
pucker
this
isnt
the
right
cantillon
for
you
this
new
recipe
is
quite
sessionable
overall
definitely
one
of
the
more
unique
lambics
i
have
had
to
date
the
dry
hops
were
definitely
something
i
have
never
experienced
in
a
beer
of
this
style
that
being
said
im
a
huge
sour
head
and
this
one
lacked
a
lot
of
tartness
that
other
cantillons
have
if
you
dont
like
your
lambics
really
sour
drink
this
one
now
and
just
enjoy
the
unique
hops
flavors
if
you
like
your
them
very
sour

750ml

with
a
surprisingly
large

lactic
tartness
and
lots
of
brett
character
very
musty
and
oaky
some
citrus
and
other

this
is
a

of
a
beer
d
i
could
seriously
drink
3
bottles
of
this
no
problems
not
too
sour
but
true
to
the
style
love
it
great
treat
get
some
if
you
can
even
if
the
other
cantillons
are
too
acidic
for
you
not
an
entry
level
sour
beer
but
not
too
crazy
advanced

thin

earthness
throughout
drinkability
is
great
wonderfully
sour
and
just
mellow
enough
to
keep
a

and
remain
drinkable

this
was
a
good
lambic
thanks
scotty
light

the
mouthfeel
is
very
dry
this
is
insanely
drinkable
this
was
split
3
ways
but
finishing
an
entire
750ml
alone
would
be
very
easy
d
truly
a
summer
beer
temps
right
now
in
low
80s
and
perfect
for
quaffing
just
wish
the
price
wasnt
so
high
overall
definitely
worth
a
look
d
at
5
or
so
this
is
a
very
easy
sipper
which
explains
why
this
first
glass
took
all
of
20
minutes
to
get
through
i
picked
this
brew
up
from
a
small
beer
store
on
one
of
my
last
days
in
europe
it
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
lots
of
effervescense
the
beer
sports
a
very
nice
white
head
thicker
than
expected
and
longlasting
the
smell
is
not
as
intense
as
it
could
be
but
theres
a
very
pleasant
grain
and
horseblanket
smell
modest
funk
with
a
little
wood
scent
the
flavor
is
very
well
balanced
not
as
sour
as
most
cantillons
this
one
is
incredibly
drinkable
the
flavor
is
still
strong

still
a

this
is

ive

and
it
is
a
completely
different
beer
the
dry

is
powerful

reminds
me
a

of

very
nice
and
i
wont
bother
to
cellar
this
in

future
wish
it
was
easier
to
get
fresh
drinkability
i
have
to
admit
it
was
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
but
the
watery
part
made
it
a
bit
borning
and
dull
to
drink
ive
had
much
much
better
from
cantillon
maybe
just
a
bad
bottle
but
i
dont
think
i
am
willing
to
shell
out
another
20
to
find
out
ive
never
been
the
same
since
had
this
on
tap
at
novare
res
earlier
in
the
summer
and
ive
seen
bottles
around
recently
as
well
poured
a
hazy
golden
with
a
light
head
and
lacing
which
is
fine
for
the
style
smells
sour
and
funky
with
a
noticeable
bandaid
aroma
the
taste
is
similar
the
bandaids
are
just
restrained
enough
to
make
this
enjoyable
any
more
flavor
from
that
department
would
just
make
this
too
challenging
sour
but
more
horseblanket
funk
than
sourness
but
some
lemon
does
start
everything
off
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
very
tannic
the
extreme
funkiness
bandaid
flavor
and
sharp
tannins
make
this
a
bit
challenging
you
really
better
like
gueuze
to
enjoy
this
brew
i
do
but
even
so
this
was
pushing
the
edge
of
the
envelope
between
great
and
undrinkable
but
that
doesnt
mean
it
isnt
an
incredible
beer
i
am
absolutely
loving
this
bottle
my
birthday
beer
but
if
i
had
a
few
bottles
i
would
sit
on
them
that
is
all
taste
mouthfeel
pretty
mild
sourness
for
cantillon
fruity
notes
of
green
apple
and
lemon
peel
are
met
with
an
interesting
herbal
hop
flavor
carbonation
is
fairly
low
here
but
its
ample
enough
to
make
it
dance
a
bit
on
the
tongue
really
a
remarkably
subtle
and
balanced
beer
i
did
not
know
anything
about
this
brew
but
i
am
glad
i
got
to
try
it
also
saw
in
on
tap
the
day
before
down
at
churchills
in
san
marcos
left
over
from
cbc
week
probably
will
not
get
to
drink
this
again
because
i
have
never
seen
it
in
bottle
form
in
the
us
recommended
a
fairly
amazing
beer
almost
a
wine
in
terms
of
the
oakiness
and
vinous
sourness
a
real
treat
a
flavor
of
lambic
sourness
that
i
still
am
getting
used
to
but
very
good
for
this
style
the
body
is
medium
with
a
sour
finish
that
is
also
astringent
a
very
good
beer
very
refreshing
and
highly
drinkable
its
nice
to
have
unblended
lambics
to
be
reminded
of
what
these
beers
can
taste
like
in
their
naked
state
sampled
7192007
i
believe
this
is
my
first
unblended
lambic
pours
a
brown
hued
orange
nose
is
slightly
like
a
certain
flavor
of
ricola
throat
drops
i
cant
remember
exactly
what
kind
but
i
think
it
was
lemon
and
herbs
or
something
like
that
antiseptic
tone
to
it
fair
amount
of
wood
is
on
there
too
flavor
is
sour
indeed
definite
wood
character
to
it
just
a
pure
mix
of
tart
and
wood
this
is
what
a
lambic
is
feel
is
as
expected
on
the
liquid
and
ripe
with
carbonation
overall
very
drinkable
if
you
havent
had
a
real
lambic
and
dont
appreciate
that
sour
funk
you
wont
dig
this
one
this
is
a
purists
dream
very
much
worth
taking
the
bus
to
philly
for
a
day
to
get
a
hold
of
great
beer
d
this
one
got
better
with
each
sip
paired
best
with
a
morbier
cheese
and
pears
shared
this
with
some
euro
soccer
fans
but
it
would
be
a
treat
to
have
a
bottle
to
myself
drinkability
decent
despite
the
strong
sour
flavors
this
beer
grew
on
me
during
the
session
and
the
taste
score
rose
as
it
warmed
very
interesting
on
tap
d
it
is
mild
and
not
to
sour
pleasant
overall
i
wouldnt
mind
having
this
one
again
not
fantastic
but
definitely
worth
trying
overall
nice
introduction
to
style
very
drinkable
in
my
opinion
seems
an
easy
transition
for
a
hophead
from
notes
750
ml
bottle
12
oz
sample
poured
a
very
clear
lightly
coppered
orange
color
with
a
sparse
whisp
of
head
over
top
after
the
pour
this
one
was
pretty
still
with
no
bubbles
working
out
of
solution
there
was
no
mistaking
what
this
beer
was
going
to
be
about
when
smelling
it
tons
of
sourness
hit
hard
with
a
big
acidic
sharpness
there
was
mild
donkey
urined
soaked
hay
acridness
and
im
not
sure
if
this
should
follow
the
last
statement
but
i
thought
it
was
very
enticing
flavor
really
assulted
me
with
sourness
on
the
first
sip
that
moved
to
a
more
vinegarlike
sharpness
and
acidity
there
was
an
odd
sharp
sweetness
in
there
as
well
that
i
could
not
correlate
to
anything
i
was
familiar
with
mouthfeel
was
moderate
with
a
very
light
carbonation
it
left
a
good
bit
of
stickey
spit
in
my
mouth
and
was
moderately
dry
on
the
finish
overall
this
was
another
winner
from
cantillon
very
good
taste
with
a
lot
of
intense
flavors
like
sour
and
acidity
not
a
lot
of
complexity
there
but
it
really
worked
for
my
taste
good
brew
on
tap
at
the
yeast
fest
spuyten
d
in
bklyn
poured
cloudy
light
apricot
nose
is
of
funky
cheesy
feet
with
a
slight
lactic
sourness
smokey
moderatly
sour
brew
with
a
long
flavorful
finish
approachable
lambic
brett
present
but
not
out
of
control
give
a
try
of
this
one
to
lambic
newbies
great
brew
to
experience
if
you
can
find
any
more
around
vibrant
aroma
with
more
fruit
hints
than
a
normal
lambic
with
subtle
lemon
orange
and
peach
and
lightly
herbaceous
floral
hops
from
the
dry
hop
perhaps
light
orange
color
dry
with
mild
tartness
and
wld
yeast
flavors
well
balanced
really
your
typical
cantillon
lambic
which
is
still
mighty
tasty
but
i
didnt
notice
much
from
the
goldings
addition
except
a
little
bitterness
much
more
drinkable
then
the
other
cantillon
products
a
truly
special
brew
taste
is
quite
puckering
at
first
then
it
seems
too
smooth
out
some
not
as
tart
as
the
grand
cru
or
iris
the
lack
of
sourness
allows
for
the
perception
of
malt
driven
flavors
although
i
am
at
a
loss
to
describe
them
second
pour
is
moderately
for
cantillon
dirty
mouthfeel
is
great
the
slight
carbonation
is
spot
on
if
not
for
the
acidity
i
could
drink
another
750ml
this
brewery
is
proving
itself
to
be
outstanding
in
my
eyes
everything
ive
tried
from
them
has
been
solid
and
unique
always
in
the
same
style
of
course
but
each
has
its
own
personality
this
ones
no
different
orange
overall
and
clear
sparkling
with
carbonation
following
a
loud
pop
of
the
cork
previous

reviewer
try
another
bottle
aroma
exists
in
funkytown
with
a
sweet
lime
tourist
and
pear
essence
passerby
lactic
with
slight
plantlike
quality
most
likely
a
generous
hop
addition
masked
by
the
barnyard
pissyness
some
candy
apple
wafts
could
be
my
imagination
and
are
certainly
not
supported
by
the
extreme
musty
but
mouthwatering
flavor
lemony
tart
and
mellower
sourness
makes
it
more
drinkable
than
the
usual
suspects
see
iris
fou
foune
bready
finish
and
age
depth
gives
this
beer
some
serious
body
for
5
lambic
sum
this
one
up
with
an
earthier
than
usual
taste
with
obscure
differences
in
lambic
style
still
great
love
cantillon
as
this
beer
warms
up
it
really
begins
to
soften
a
bit
open
up
and
become
quite
a
bit
more
fruity
with
lots
of
grapefruit
and
lemon
notes
this
is
definitely
quite
enjoyable
and
i
definitely
do
not
enjoy
lambics
enough
it
is
definitely
a
special
occasion
type
beer
for
me
and
i
would
much
prefer
that
it
was
an
everyday
beer
for
me
green
apple
paste
lemon
marmelade
and
oak
aromas
emerge
from
the
brown
paper
and
orange
colored
liquid
the
top
is
a
scummy
slick
of
dirty
white
sweet
cherry
and
strawberry
pulp
flavors
detail
a
huge
thrust
of
leafy
lemony
hop
aromas
which
are
in
turn
buried
by
gastric
sour
cidery
mustard
extractions
solid
tender
textured
but
scarcely
sweet
monumental
this
is
quite
accessible
and
except
for
the
fact
that
its
a
limited
edition
and
rather
pricey
this
would
make
a
great
entry
in
to
geueze
for
those
whove
only
experienced
the
fruitflavored
lambics
overall
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
special
release
cantillon
which
i
thought
i
would
never
get
to
taste
a
seriously
big
thanks
goes
out
to
the
awesome
beericaweizen
for
the
opportunity
to
try
this
one
i
owe
ya
taste
you
can
see
he
added
both
fresh
hops
and
candi
sugar
to
help
out
with
carbonation
and
i
thought
jean
pierre
didnt
like
sweetness
in
his
beers
the
sweet
and
sour
combo
is
quite
nice
but
this
isnt
my
favorite
opaque
gold
very
murky
a
nice
sight
color
wise
but
unfortunately
a
quickly
departing
head
aroma
feels
surprisingly
sweet
as
always
well
presented
on
a
sweaty
and
leathery
dominated
wild
yeast
top
ground
more
floral
than
most
thanks
to
those
untamed
hops
it
develops
a
pleasant
horsey
saltiness
as
it
gains
temperature
its
hard
to
explain
how
those
hops
blend
in
with
the
rest
but
it
creates
a
cheesier
character
than
the
yeast
alone
would
i
feel
abundant
grapefruit
taste
strong
big
bubbles
surprising
considering
the
small
shape
of
the
head
pretty
full
bodied
as
well
i
like
that
oldish
taste
despite
the
fresh
aroma
sweet
and
easy
drinking
proposing
a
lemon
slice
here
and
there
that
grows
into
a
pungent
tartness
reminiscent
of
a
straight
lambic
i
kinda
dig
the
balance
but
it
doesnt
stand
out
as
one
of
my
favourites
i
just
like
its
originality
a
dessert
lambic
why
not
750ml
bottle
2004
vintage
dark
golden
yellow
with
a
nice
head
of
tight
white
foam
lacing
is
minimal
but
pretty
nonetheless
aromas
are
all
lactic
lambic
funkiness
with
a
real
juicy
earthiness
abounding
in
this
particular
vintage
bottling
i
get
hints
of
horse
blanket
in
the
aromas
as
well
as
hints
of
very
acidic
fruits
musty
juice
and
more
ya
know
the
normal
stuff
the
taste
is
exceptional
but
very
subdued
for
a
cantillon
this
is
not
nearly
as
sharp
acrid
or
acidic
as
most
of
cantillons
other
offerings
this
is
quite
juciy
in
fact
and
less
dry
than
most
other
gueuzes
available
on
the
market
today
there
is
also
a
distinctively
bitter
aftertaste
that
must
be
from
the
use
of
dry
hopping
although
this
brew
is
still
far
from
what
id
call
hoppy
mouthfeel
is
champagne
like
spritzy
and
grand
and
the
drinkability
is
absolutely
awesome
wow
what
a
quaffable
laid
back
gueuze
from
the
masters
of
lambic
i
need
to
try
the
loerik
next
for
sure
overall
i
like
this
as
i
like
the
cantillon
products
but
to
be
honest
i
have
yet
to
learn
to
fully
appreciate
these
beers
ill
keep
trying
though
because
i
do
like
this
one
and
its
siblings
not
digging
this
one
miss
for
me
tastes
of
tart
funk
matured
white
grape
skin
musty
old
lime
and
a
dry
touch
of
oaken
cognac
while
the
beer
has
a
distinct
slightly
fruity
wooden
character
its
typical
sourness
is
a
bit
subdued
the
wooden
aspect
contains
a
slight
sweetness
of
fermented
apples
leading
to
a
medium
body
with
low
carbonation
another
overly
hyped
cantillon
sorry
but
just
tastes
like
vinegar
verdict
i
cant
say
im
loving
this
one
enjoyable
for
sure
unique
and
creative
but
the
cognac
is
really
assertive
and
for
my
palate
too
sweet
and
too
rich
for
a
gueuze
or
a
lambic
a
novel
experiment
that
achieves
minor
success
but
a
bit
lacking
complexity
and
balance
huge
thanks
to
thirtybird
for
send
this
one
over
2012
vintage
slightly
hazy
golden
yellow
with
a
consistent
bright
white
head
nose
is
musty
citrusy
and
slightly
grassy
some
wood
but
surprisingly
little
cognac
taste
is
on
par
with
nose
mouthfeel
is
light
with
a
bright
carbonation
and
a
pleasant
acidity
light
tartness
and
semidry
finish
solid
beer
but
not
my
favorite
from
this
brewer
cant
believe
i
got
to
try
this
amazing
a
low
carbonation
lambic
with
lemon
and
grass
in
the
front
however
the
beer
changes
with
a
european
hop
flavor
and
then
heavy
floral
notes
and
sweet
honey
on
the
back
end
drinking
this
at
moeder
lambic
very
bright
and
vibrant
cost
30
for
a
750
ml
bottle
o
a
tasty
well
seasoned
beer
just
not
one
of
my
favorites
from
cantillon
d
overall
this
was
disappointing
but
given
within
the
context
of
cantillon
outside
of
this
brewerys
context
it
is
still
a
damn
good
beer
worth
the
trouble
to
get
probably
not
cleverly
done
and
deceptively
complex
while
the
coganc
influence
causes
a
diminution
of
the
gueuze
character
the
subtle
interplay
between
the
two
is
quite
intriguing
bottle
courtesy
cparles
shared
at
collected
works
tasting
incredible
aroma
just
everything
you
want
gueuze
to
be
very
fruity
with
prominent
vinous
and
lemon
notes
with
a
significant
horsey
funk
not
quite
as
cobwebbybasementy
as
some
gueuzes
but
i
like
this
better
flavor
is
similar
unripe
wine
grapes
lemon
lime
pulp
straw
and
wet
wood
cognac
influence
really
brightens
the
beer
just
lovely
unique
and
highly
differentiated
from
their
standard
range
o
this
is
my
first
rarer
cantillon
and
it
lived
up
to
what
i
was
expecting
overall
the
barrel
adds
complexity
even
if
i
cant
really
distinguish
it
o
a
very
interesting
twist
on
the
standard
gueuze
and
for
the
most
part
very
successful
as
an
everyday
beer
i
would
probably
prefer
the
standard
but
this
is
definitely
an
enjoyable
take
on
the
style
easy
drinking
bright
on
the
palate
as
expected
and
a
nice
finish
overall
it
is
a
great
drinker
the
liquor
is
present
on
the
palate
and
the
oak
bitterness
is
in
the
finish
dry
overall
but
not
harsh
i
enjoyed
this
beer
a
lot
too
bad
it
is
so
difficult
to
obtain
unlabeled
bottle
50
degrees
etched
on
golden
orange
body
fizzy
carbonation
cognac
barrel
is
completely
evident
less
tart
than
the
standard
gueuze
but
a
well
rounded
flavor
profile
that
i
assume
will
improve
with
age
as
the
barrel
wears
and
the
gueuze
ages
nice
notes
of
vanilla
lemon
and
that
funky
cantillon
yeast
i
brought
a
bottle
home
to
consume
in
a
few
years
o
solid
cantillon
where
the
cognac
shines
thru
and
adds
a
light
boozy
mustiness
to
it
o
a
little
rough
around
the
edges
at
this
point
i
think
it
needs
some
time
to
let
the
cognac
meld
into
the
beer
and
some
of
the
funk
to
come
up
still
a
really
nice
beer
overall
i
have
to
say
i
was
really
disappointed
with
this
one
exciting
to
try
but
not
what
i
hoped
for
i
am
curious
as
to
how
this
will
age
i
hope
it
retains
the
cognac
flavors
yet
the
alcohol
bite
that
compliments
them
dimishes
looking
forward
to
revisiting
in
a
few
years
because
this
is
far
too
young
right
now
edit
the
answer
was
yes
overall
quite
nice
still
nice
cantillon
kick
bit
more
mild
than
most
and
drinkable
less
funk
and
fruit
but
a
nice
beer
and
very
unique
for
a
gueuze
its
quite
unique
othis
is
a
great
beer
and
a
pleasant
surprise
for
me
like
most
cantillon
it
has
that
vinous
complexity
and
i
think
the
less
tart
more
caramel
aspects
only
enhance
the
flavors
here
delicious
but
i
dont
think
the
pricerarityhunt
for
this
one
is
worth
it
pours
a
murky
light
orange
with
a
foamy
white
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
slowly
drip
into
the
remaining
beer
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
sour
tart
and
funky
with
fruit
and
acidic
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
fruit
and
wood
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
acidity
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
with
some
nice
aromas
and
flavors
m
smooth
on
the
palate
with
a
dry
finish
o
truly
delicious
this
is
definitely
the
most
unique
and
also
one
of
the
tastiest
lambics
ive
had
the
cognac
barrel
character
is
really
delicious
and
complements
the
tart
funky
lambic
flavors
in
a
way
i
didnt
expect
a
stunning
beer

big
thanks
goes
out
to
beeruser
for
sharing
this
one
during
a
fair
sized
cantillon
tasting
2007
vintage
served
from
bottle
into
a
cantillon
balloon
poured
fluorescent
orange
with
a
minimal
white
head
maintained
phenomenal
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
funk
fruit
wood
spice
tart
and
sour
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
funk
big
sour
acidic
sweet
fruit
and
tart
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
medium
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
good
brew
i
was
really
surprised
when
i
heard
that
this
one
would
be
at
our
tasting
that
evening
a
sour
aged
in
cognac
barrels
is
all
it
took
for
me
to
start
drooling
over
this
one
before
even
opening
it
after
all
the
time
this
one
has
had
to
age
i
really
wasnt
expecting
much
of
the
barrel
flavors
to
be
around
however
it
was
still
there
with
a
nice
sweet
fruit
aspect
that
you
would
get
off
a
good
cognac
really
impressive
when
i
say
big
sour
i
really
meant
it
this
one
had
a
whole
new
level
of
sour
when
compared
to
the
other
cantillon
brews
tasted
that
night
as
it
almost
knocked
you
off
your
feet
really
glad
i
got
the
chance
to
try
this
one
and
would
love
to
do
so
again
in
the
future
if
the
opportunity
presents
itself
i
suggest
you
do
the
same
pours
murky
and
still
for
a
lambic
murky
probably
because
the
pour
was
from
the
later
end
of
the
bottle
still
because
i
am
not
sure
regardless
the
carbonation
was
just
fine
on
the
palate
smells
funky
very
hay
like
my
buddy
commented
that
this
beer
alone
is
enough
to
justify
the
barnyard
adjective
or
something
along
those
lines
the
acidity
is
moderate
in
taste
theres
lemon
and
then
some
nuttiness
which
is
odd
i
guess
but
i
liked
that
aspect
while
different
from
other
gueuze
and
quite
tasty
having
had
many
loons
in
small
quantities
i
can
safely
say
that
as
far
as
my
tastes
go
3f
is
where
its
at
o
not
the
greatest
flavor
profile
and
a
little
muted
but
still
a
very
delicious
and
drinkable
beer

pours
a
clear
golden
amber
with
no
head
there
are
a
couple
of
bubbles
around
the
edge
of
the
glass
and
no
lacing
the
aroma
is
funky
with
the
cognac
presence
obvious
and
a
bit
of
oak
there
is
also
a
light
mushroom
note
a
bit
of
alcohol
is
there
as
well
its
not
a
lot
but
more
than
any
other
lambic
ive
had
the
initial
taste
has
a
light
sweetness
with
a
decent
tartness
there
is
some
funky
oak
a
bit
of
brandy
and
some
mushroom
the
finish
has
some
brandy
and
a
bit
of
alcohol
medium
body
low
carbonation
not
bad
but
certainly
not
my
favorite
cantillon
beer
it
could
have
used
a
little
more
carbonation
oextremely
unique
gueuze
by
cantillon
i
know
jean
hated
how
this
turned
out
but
i
liked
it
a
lot
cant
wait
to
open
my
bottle
well
i
had
another
bottle
of
this
and
my
opinion
has
changed
a
bit
the
second
bottle
had
an
amazing
combination
of
citrus
acidity
heavy
funk
and
a
pretty
wild
edge
from
the
cognac
barrel
about
as
good
as
the
2007
classic
chilled
750
decanted
without
yeast
or
sediment
and
shared
with
friends
pours
a
light
gold
with
a
thin
white
head
the
nose
is
full
of
funk
raw
fruit
wood
and
sweet
grapes
the
taste
is
acidic
and
funky
as
expected
with
a
bit
of
sulfur
too
mouth
feel
is
light
with
a
medium
carbonation
to
high
carbonation
a
dry
finish
and
a
warming
finish
in
the
throatprobably
from
the
acidity
the
finish
includes
waves
of
light
fruit
with
brilliant
tartness
subtle
brandy
and
woody
vanilla
i
did
pick
up
some
subtle
vinous
notes
in
the
smell
and
taste
but
the
cognac
clearly
takes
a
backseat
to
all
other
characteristics
of
the
gueuze
with
that
said
it
was
still
incredibly
enjoyable
review
revisited
this
beer
is
fantastic
like
a
deeper
earthier
and
cognac
influenced
version
of
an
armand
4
overall
wow
i
really
hope
they
make
this
again
soon
no
sign
of
this
dropping
off
anytime
soon
i
dont
like
the
word
unique
as
a
descriptor
but
this
is
certainly
different
and
50n4e
has
depth
to
it
having
had
this
next
to
crianza
i
have
to
say
i
probably
prefer
that
beer
to
this
one
maybe
because
contra
most
peoples
experiences
theres
a
bit
too
much
cognac
character
here
for
me
and
the
acetone
on
the
nose
is
hugely
offputting
looking
back
at
this
rating
i
need
to
have
this
beer
again
would
be
cool
to
drink
next
to
crianza
helena
o
quite
a
nice
brew
though
it
is
not
as
good
as
cuvee
des
champions
which
preceded
it
overall
i
tried
as
hard
as
i
could
to
pinpoint
the
cognac
but
the
only
barrel
influence
i
found
was
from
the
oak
the
funk
in
this
beer
is
great
as
is
almost
always
the
case
with
cantillon
but
the
subtleties
of
the
fruit
flavors
set
this
one
apart
well
worth
a
shot
cheers
pretty
mellow
on
the
sourness
really
smooth
and
tasty
o
overall
another
great
cantillon
beer
in
my
opinion
there
beers
continue
to
live
up
to
my
expectations
would
love
to
have
it
again
sometime
this
is
the
second
amazing
cognac
barrelaged
brew
i
have
had
this
year
im
not
necessarily
a
big
fan
of
cognac
per
se
but
apparently
when
done
right
it
can
really
invigorate
a
beer
and
add
a
wealth
of
complexity
and
flavor
o
drinking
very
well
the
flavor
and
aroma
were
quite
complex
and
pleasing
perhaps
just
lacking
a
little
bit
more
assertiveness
with
that
said
i
dont
see
this
improving
much
with
age
other
than
perhaps
resolving
a
little
bit
of
the
balance
between
funk
and
tartness
that
said
i
also
cant
see
it
going
downhill
either
d
among
a
field
of
incredibly
hyped
and
wellregarded
gueuzes
this
was
a
big
surprise
just
very
well
balanced
and
executed
overall
with
almost
nothing
to
complain
of
complexity
and
feel
are
spot
well
worth
seeking
out
and
i
hope
to
find
a
few
more
to
see
what
age
will
do
to
this
beauty
d
very
drinkable
puckering
could
be
a
limiting
factor
but
i
imagine
that
if
youre
able
to
try
this
beer
youre
a
fan
of
that
aspect
of
the
style
this
is
definitely
another
great
cantillon
worth
sharing
the
taste
delivers
at
the
same
level
with
strong
barnyard
funk
coming
out
strong
straight
out
of
the
gate
there
is
a
boozy
cognac
presence
that
really
accentuates
the
sour
components
of
this
brew
in
what
is
just
a
fantastic
job
of
blending
and
aging
i
love
the
feel
and
the
finish
is
superb
thanks
again
to
eric
for
really
going
above
and
beyond
opening
some
worldclass
brews
that
i
thought
i
would
have
to
wait
awhile
to
try
let
alone
having
a
single
generous
ba
open
them
all
in
one
night
lightly
carbonated
compared
with
standard
cantillon
gueuze
making
a
slightly
bigger
mouthfeel
that
works
well
with
the
agressive
flavor
cantillon
is
always
so
solid
if
you
ever
see
it
i
highly
recommend
it
d
wow
had
two
pours
of
this
funky
stuff
the
taste
lingered
with
me
long
after
i
was
finished
very
unique
and
cool
offering
by
the
one
and
only
cantillon
taste
is
very
funky
and
tart
but
still
very
drinkable
its
gt
a
very
nice
amount
of
sour
that
wont
kill
your
pallate
so
quick
very
tasty
d
this
was
excellent
but
the
cognac
note
made
things
feel
a
little
boozier
than
i
expected
from
lambic
just
noticed
the
slightly
higher
abv
its
also
growing
very
acetic
and
i
was
getting
protests
from
my
stomach
as
we
worked
through
the
bottle
still
its
highly
recommended
if
you
can
still
find
it
d
pretty
easy
to
drink
although
the
tartness
will
get
to
you
after
a
while
i
had
this
from
a
750ml
bottle
at
dld
the
beer
looks
like
any
lambic
cloudy
hazy
medium
brown
nice
light
carbonation
the
aroma
is
really
nice
likes
of
sour
funk
horse
blanket
but
nicely
balanced
with
some
sweetness
i
think
thats
the
cognac
very
similar
to
the
taste
has
a
little
acidity
and
vinegar
to
it
very
nice
overall
mouthfeel
perhaps
a
bit
too
light
on
the
carbonation
the
barrels
do
give
it
a
nice
structured
element
i
cant
say
that
i
am
picking
up
a
ton
of
cognac
flavor
though
it
has
lent
a
tiny
hint
of
alcohol
bite
through
the
back
this
is
a
great
beer
though
what
else
would
you
expect
from
cantillon
a
very
nice
and
complex
concoction
i
hope
i
get
another
chance
to
try
it
in
the
future
2007
vintage
the
cork
eases
out
perfectly
spongy
in
tact
with
a
muted
pop
immediately
the
aroma
of
funk
starts
to
emanate
poured
into
gueuze
tumblers
with
a
robust
seafoamlike
head
with
lingering
retention
nose
is
musty
bretty
reminiscent
of
a
horse
stable
on
a
cool
summer
night
the
bacteria
has
a
pronounced
and
complex
flavor
followed
by
the
subtle
undertone
of
cognac
the
lambic
essence
is
so
deep
and
rich
the
effort
is
perfectly
executed
with
a
touch
of
warmth
on
the
back
end
the
barnyard
resonance
transcends
into
faint
booziness
which
could
almost
be
confused
as
lingering
oak
from
the
barrel
if
you
observe
closely
theres
really
something
more
here
the
small
nuances
are
what
really
puts
this
in
distant
perspective
with
other
cantillon
gueuze
of
the
same
vintage
made
from
the
same
loom
but
certainly
a
different
fabric
makes
everything
else
in
life
fade
into
nothingness
truly
a
world
class
offering
there
are
white
peaches
and
pear
skins
though
plus
the
yellow
woodsorrel
present
in
most
of
cantillons
catalog
and
like
their
other
lambics
50n
by
4e
is
moderately
carbonated
generous
with
its
wood
and
pleasantly
rank
but
whats
this
in
the
finish
heat
in
a
lambic
maybe
some
of
that
cognac
rubbed
off
after
all
d
the
cognac
barrels
really
do
provide
a
bit
of
something
different
even
if
there
is
not
necessarily
a
lot
of
cognac
flavor
in
the
beer
a
very
interesting
and
good0
lambic
and
youd
expect
nothing
less
from
cantillon
this
beer
displays
an
astonishing
amount
of
complexity
the
evolution
and
change
in
flavours
from
just
a
few
degrees
is
phenomenal
highly
recommended
and
a
definite
favourite
overall
an
amazing
sour
very
well
done
and
i
really
want
more
i
highly
recommend
this
one
very
unique
overall
a
job
well
done
by
cantillon
on
this
one
definitely
a
subdued
lambic
dont
expect
a
sour
kick
to
the
mouth
either
if
this
hadnt
followed
hommage
im
sure
i
would
have
liked
it
more
unfortunately
it
cant
hold
a
candle
to
the
wind
yet
is
still
very
drinkable
probably
more
so

larger

this

is
not
going
to
be
a
problem
in
fact
its
going
to
suck
that
thats
all
i
have
of
this
splendid
beer
note
to
self
buy
every
cantillon
beer
no
matter
how
negative
some
reviews
might
be
d
the
flavor
is
very
well
balanced
here
it
is
predominantly
sour
and
dry
but
not
intensely
acetic
and
unpleasant
on
the
palate
funk
is
a
supporting
flavor
and
the
impressive
palette
of
fruity
flavors
gives
this
some
real
depth
but
i
still
have
no
grasp
what
the
cognac
barrels
added
here
besides
a
substantial
price
premium
dcertainly
interesting
but
it
is
so
chaotic
i
find
it
hard
to
actually
enjoy
for
long
i
appreciate
the
opportunity
to
try
but
found
it
no
better
than
some
of
the
other
easier
to
find
sours
i
have
had
so
i
shouldnt
say
this
smells
like
diaper
pail
d
tasty
as
hell
i
want
more
thanks
to
capones
for
supplying
me
this
bottle
tm
the
taste
is
similarly
amazing
alternating
between
funk
sweetness
tannins
and
sharp
sourness
lemons
green
apples
apricots
salt
vanilla
so
complex
yet
so
harmonious
the
barrel
lends
a
hint
of
cognac
along
with
a
slight
and
very
welcome
heat
the
finish
is
dry
tannic
sharp
and
lingering
this
is
one
of
the
most
unique
lambics
ive
had
and
surely
one
of
the
best
d
i
really
like
this
one
a
fantastic
lambic
with
a
rather
unique
character
due
to
the
cognac
flavor
the
cognac
delivers
a
very
sophisticated
edge
to
the
beer
among
the
best
beer
ive
had
from
this
fantastic
brewery
and
that
says
quite
a
lot
light
bodied
with
a
low
level
of
carbonation
which
i
was
pleased
with
another
great
beer
from
cantillon
md
very
mild
on
the
carbonation
superbly
rounded
and
smooth
on
the
palate
and
only
a
little
alc
could
be
sensed
after
many
a
sip
i
think
this
one
has
become
one
of
my
two
favourite
lambicgeuze
by
cantillon
the
other
being
iris
for
totally
different
reasons
of
course
the
finest
touch
of
this
lambic
rests
on
its
integrity
and
a
delicate
input
of
cognac
barrels
while
keeping
a
smooth
yet
still
reasonably
complex
profile
of
the
lambic
base
honestly
the
best
of
both
worlds
is
somewhat
attained
in
this
bottle
q
why
does
the
label
refer
it
to
a
geuze
if
it
was
unblended
would
love
to
make
this
a
way
of
life
to
truly
understand
the
delicate
touch
yet
i
dont
think
im
buying
this
one
again
at
30
buck
a
bottle
drinkability
very
drinkable
easy
on
the
palate
and
good
mouthfeel
and
taste
exceptional
lambic
the
pour
was
nice
rich
amber
in
color
with
a
light
haziness
and
a
nice
lift
puff
of
white
on
top
lots
of
funk
here
as
i
take
the
first
whiff
off
the
top
of
it
rich
vinegar
aroma
with
a
hint
of
grapes
and
light
apples
as
i
take
the
first
sip
lips
pucker
and
the
huge
sour
funky
flavor
comes
right
through
lots
of
light
fruit
notes
buried
under
a
wall
of
apple
vinegar
like
flavor
very
dry
in
the
finish
with
a
nice
smooth
delivery
and
a
good
medium
feel
to
it
smooth
sessioanble
and
a
nice
sipper
at
the
same
time
another
winner
form
cantillon
for
sure
i
am
glad
i
sought
this
one
out
as
i
nice
sour
sipper
is
what
i
needed
at
this
point
in
time
d
this
is
the
easiest
drinking
unblended
lambic
i
have
drank
there
is
a
nice
flavor
and
a
good
balance
of
sweet
and
tart
and
other
flavors
adding
to
the
complexity
pours
a
hazy
golden
yellowis
orange
color
with
a
thin
fizzy
white
head
tart
and
funky
aroma
with
hints
of
oak
and
whiskey
puckering
but
not
too
acidic
lighter
bodied
than
most
gueze
probably
a
result
of
the
aging
nicely
balanced
somewhat
malty
with
light
carbonation
and
light
crisp
fruit
the
oak
and
cognac
really
come
through
making
this
a
really
unique
gueze
excellent
notes
from
and
tasted
on
92708
very
light
golden
orange
color
with
a
small
white
head
aroma
smells
of
traditional
cantillon
lambic
with
a
very
very
light
added
hint
of
cognac
flavor
is
aged
well
blended
lambic
with
just
the
slightest
note
of
cognac
lacking
the
softness
i
would
prefer
and
mainly
just
harsh
oude
gueuze
a
bit
off
balance
and
with
out
cognac
character
pours
golden
with
a
soft
white
head
aroma
is
sour
lemon
barnyard
but
not
overpowering
not
as
sour
as
i
thought
considering
some
of
the
other
gueuzes
out
there
flavor
is
well
balanced
with
some
earthy
notes
that
linger
throughout
and
in
the
finish
finished
semidry
but
not
mouthpuckering
a
complex
and
well
done
beer
so
so
glad
i
have
two
of
these
the
price
tag
was
worth
getting
two
dextremely
smoothdrinking
wcomplexity
and
finesse
d
awesome
well
rounded
funky
but
super
smooth
and
substantial
maybe
i
am
in
the
minority
here
but
this
is
something
different
from
cantillon
and
a
welcome
addition
to
their
lineup
for
me
i
find
this
a
flawless
brew
and
possibly
the
most
interesting
of
the
cantillon
brews
drinkability
was
ok
i
didnt
like
the
rich
booziness
of
the
cognac
with
the
lambic
perhaps
with
more
age
it
would
smooth
out
and
gain
more
sourness
im
always
happy
to
try
a
rare
expensive
beer
but
sometimes
their
rarity
leads
them
to
being
overhyped
which
i
would
say
is
probably
the
case
here
good
but
if
youve
got
em
give
em
some
time
had
no
idea
what
this
beer
was
until
i
traded
for
it
but
that
was
the
fun
in
it
all
a
little
skeptical
after
seeing
it
was
a
lambic
aged
in
cognac
barrels
seemed
like
two
very
odd
tastes
as
one
but
it
did
work
well
cantillon
is
truly
a
great
brewery
would
definitely
drink
this
again
recommended
pours
a
hazy
golden
with
a
nice
initial
head
that
fades
to
a
ring
this
beer
is
labeled
2007
so
it
is
still
a
little
young
it
should
integrate
a
little
more
and
become
a
bit
funkier
as
time
goes
on
as
is
it
is
quite
nice
but
each
component
still
stands
apart
instead
of
being
well
blended
into
a
harmonious
whole
somewhat
fubky
and
acetic
up
front
and
with
a
finish
that
is
both
a
tiny
bit
sweet
with
vanilla
from
the
oak
and
has
a
nice
ring
of
cognac
in
the
finish
as
well
it
is
a
little
unusual
especially
the
hint
of
sweetness
after
the
laserlike
sourness
that
cantillon
is
known
for
but
it
really
seems
to
work
the
aromas
are
a
bit
more
subdued
than
the
taste
but
they
both
work
with
the
taste
being
particularly
tart
and
somewhat
funky
with
an
earthy
minerality
in
addition
to
the
sour
oak
and
cognac
nice
beer
ill
be
interested
to
try
this
again
in
a
few
years
pours
a
fogged
gold
with
a
thin
creme
head
nose
is
funky
kind
of
a
citric
acidity
there
flavor
is
interesting
noticeable
bite
from
wood
aging
and
cognac
almost
seems
to
carry
a
bit
of
an
apple
tone
to
it
crisp
and
slightly
biting
overall
the
combination
of
lambic
funk
wood
aging
and
cognac
makes
for
an
interesting
combination
feel
is
kind
of
sticky
slick
on
the
liquid
and
the
carbonation
is
fairly
low
overall
pretty
nice
to
drink
a
bit
of
a
bite
to
it
but
still
good
i
am
really
surprised
how
mellow
the
barrel
character
is
here
the
cognac
must
have
stripped
out
a
lot
of
those
oak
flavors
this
is
a
very
well
balanced
beer
the
barrel
plays
a
significant
supporting
role
here
sourness
of
course
takes
the
lead
but
not
excessively
so
this
is
not
as
hard
as
some
cantillons
and
the
funk
is
definitely
a
supporting
character
i
like
that
this
was
lightly
carbonated
given
that
this
is
not
a
blended
beer
i
was
expecting
a
much
flatter
experience
but
the
soft
carbonation
definitely
adds
a
nice
touch
to
the
texture
quite
the
tasty
beer
i
certainly
wouldnt
mind
having
a
lot
more
of
this
in
my
cellar
no
head
on
a
yellowish
gold
pour
smell
is
musty
bandaid
like
and
hoppy
didnt
get
anything
i
would
have
identified
as
cognac
though
taste
is
tart
funky
and
nicely
hoppy
very
light
carbonation
with
a
thin
body
sour
but
not
intensely
so
and
a
milder
thinner
flavor
than
expected
interesting
but
not
particularly
wowing
for
the
style
just
ok
the
taste
in
the
beginning
was
tart
slightly
medicinal
along
with
a
hot
alcohol
cognac
note
as
the
beer
warmed
the
citrus
and
cognac
notes
intensified
and
were
really
pleasing
on
the
tongue
overall
this
is
a
really
solid
and
drinkable
beer
and
another
fine
example
of
what
cantillon
does
drink
oh
yeah
very
good
on
the
drinkability
mostly
due
to
the
incredible
balance
of
flavors
definitely
one
to
savor
and
take
your
time
with
bought
at
cantillon
pours
a
light
amber
color
with
a
decent
head
for
the
style
aromas
are
decidedly
tart
with
hints
of
oak
and
cognacin
which
the
beer
is
agedcognac
barrels
in
the
mouth
the
beer
is
silky
smooth
offering
an
aggressive
note
of
wood
and
cognac
damn
this
is
a
tasty
treat
im
so
glad
i
brought
this
beauty
home
next
stop
for
this
beer
is
with
a

with

the
wonderful

that

this

yield
the
true
meaning
of
the
barrel
in
that
to
me
i
cannot
really
taste
the
barrel
or
the
cognac
in
the
beer
itself
with
their
respective
individual
notes
or
characters
instead
i
can
sense
deeply
that
the
barrel
and
the
cognac
has
made
this
a
better
lambic
my
mellowing
melding
and
bringing
a
new
sense
to
an
old
favorite
masterful
and
bold
a
treat
to
try
and
my
favorite
of
the
night
beer
parts
with
a
wisp
of
fresh
pink

and

thanks
to
whomever
provided
this
fantastic

just
an
outstanding
coolship
beer
hay
grass
wood
apples

not
as
acidic
as
the
cantillon
geuzes
lacks
a
little
depth
but
has
a
fantastic
balance
soft
lively
carbonation
adding
to
the
refreshing
character
great
aroma
but
a
little
too
tanicacetic
for
me
very
good
but
not
great
this
is
a
great
take
on
a
wild
ale
out
of
all
the
allagash
wild
ales
this
is
near
the
top
nice
funk
while
not
overly
sour
i
have
one
left
and
will
be
saving
this
for
a
while
amazing
flavor
with
a
wonderful
tart
finish
this
beer
replicates
the
classic
belgian
gueuzes
extremely
well
and
is
one
of
the
best
attempts
at
the
style
on
this
side
of
the
atlantic
super
good
o
other
than
maybe
a
little
more
sour
bite
or
a
twist
in
the
end
taste
i
feel
this
beer
probably
cant
do
much
better
to
increase
my
enjoyment
flavor
fruity
and
complex
taste
starts
sweet
and
sour
but
turns
tart
and
bitter
by
the
finish
quite
tart
midtaste
overall
what
an
excellent
beer
this
is
after
aging
it
in
my
cellar
for
three
years
hits
on
all
the
right
notes
i
have
to
remind
myself
to
get
a
few
bottles
next
time
i
was
somewhat
strapped
for
cash
when
i
got
this
bottle
but
this
is
at
least
onpar
with
the
great
gueuze
i
have
had
tons
of
flavor
and
complexity
with
a
great
sourness
o
unique
flavors
but
very
welcoming
and
nice
not
sure
if
this
blend
is
technically
a
gueuze
or
not
but
what
does
it
matter
a
genius
blend
of
young
and
old
blonde
sour
beers
ages
in
oak
and
the
result
could
not
be
any
more
wonderful
not
could
this
series
of
beers
from
allagash
murky
but
really
pale
blonde
color
white
hues
to
it
under
a
very
white
and
light
as
a
cloud
inch
of
head
it
smells
incredible
that
oaky
sourness
with
a
ton
of
lacto
derived
acidity
that
we
usually
associate
with
the
sours
of
old
world
belgium
its
that
authentic
mix
of
farmy
musty
yeastiness
and
exuberant
carbonation
that
tickles
my
nose
the
flavor
is
everything
you
would
expect
from
the
style
but
with
a
few
special
twists
the
first
is
in
the
finish
which
has
an
almost
white
grapey
flavor
to
it
that
balances
the
acidity
that
would
otherwise
be
gargantuan
maybe
more
of
a
white
cranberry
as
it
is
still
tart
but
its
not
what
i
usually
get
in
lambic
types
yet
is
is
extraordinary
successful
where
ever
it
comes
from
the
second
little
surprise
here
is
the
feel
its
so
well
carbonated
sometimes
the
belgian
examples
come
flat
but
i
love
this
level
of
effervescence
in
a
lambic
style
and
both
coolship
series
beers
ive
tried
have
had
it
so
far
missing
nothing
this
blended
sour
is
both
elegant
and
extreme
and
rivals
beers
like
rueuze
for
the
best
made
in
its
category
in
the
united
states
i
cant
remember
better
poured
into
a
coolship
glass
surprising
clarity
champagnelike
bubbles
feeding
a
cap
of
foamy
white
head
that
started
at
about
an
inch
and
sank
to
a
thin
layer
minor
dots
of
lacing
on
the
glass
got
cloudy
as
some
of
the
bottomdwelling
yeast
made
its
way
into
the
glass
in
the
second
half
of
the
pour
fruity

citrus

and
some
bready

maybe
a
little
less
tart
and
a
little
more
sweet
than
your
typical
authentic
belgian
gueuze
but
it
worked
well
nonetheless
drinking
very
good
for
3
years
old
lightmedium
body
easy
drinkability
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
nice
overall
overall
this
beer
is
soooo
seriously
funky
that
i
think
this
maybe
the
funkiest
beer
that
i
have
drank
yet
to
date
it
reminds
me
alot
of
cantillion
classic
gueuze
it
might
even
be
significantly
funkier
than
the
cantillion
classic
gueuze
phenominal
mouthfeel
on
this
gueuze
it
seems
that
allgash
has
some
serious
finesse
with
thier
coolship
gotta
be
a
funk
lover
to
appreciate
this
brew
i
am
a
huge
fan
of
the
gueuze
this
was
no
exception
thanks
to
my
friend
sean
for
the
gift
of
this
breweryonly
release
oda
delectable
treat
holds
up
to
most
any
gueuze
i
have
had
from
its
birthplace
lucky
to
have
tried
a
rather
elusive
brew
poured
a
hazy
yellow
into
the
glass
with
some
light
white
head
swirling
around
the
top
of
the
beer
tart
nose
with
some
lemony
esters
this
beer
tasted
like
cantillon
gueuze
with
pure
lemon
juice
added
tart
like
no
other
beer
ive
ever
experienced
even
some
of
the
veteran
sour
drinkers
at
my
tasting
were
puckered
by
this
one
this
was
not
a
hit
for
me
i
couldnt
imagine
drinking
a
bottle
its
a
well
made
beer
but
it
was
just
too
one
note
for
me
if
youre
still
learning
and
exploring
sours
do
not
attempt
to
tame
this
beast
pours
a
slightly
hazy
light
yellow
color
with
a
smallish
white
head
that
quickly
dissipates
to
swirls
of
foam
on
top
aromas
of
lemony
tartness
and
barnyard
funk
the
flavor
is
quite
tart
with
huge
tooth
enamel
dissolving
properties
lemons
and
earthy
funk
make
up
most
of
the
flavor
here
the
finish
is
fairly
dry
but
leaves
a
lingering
tartness
on
the
palette
medium
body
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
and
a
tart
puckering
mouthfeel
tart
lightly
funky
brew
thats
light
and
refreshing
like
lemonade
on
a
hot
day
i
enjoyed
it
im
glad
i
got
to
try
it
o
this
is
a
great
coolship
style
beer
and
easily
one
of
the
best
sours
coming
out
of
the
us
however
i
dont
think
it
quite
compares
to
some
of
the
best
belgian
gueuzes
and
lambics
definitely
worth
trying
if
you
like
funky
beers
and
im
very
glad
i
have
relatively
easy
access
to
this
beer
as
its
only
available
at
the
brewery
in
portland
maine
notes
from
mid
2012
got
a
full
de
ranke

of

the

that
has
some
nice

going

aroma
is
instantly
gauze
i
didnt
know
what
to
expect
from
a
real
american
geuze
honestly
peraps
nationalistically
i
expected
it
to
be
ok
but
weaker
than
the
best
belgian
counterparts
because
i
believed
that
the
factory
had
to
become
saturated
y
the
critters
over
a
long
period
of
time
man
was
i
wrong

a

going

definitely
more
acidic
territory
in
the
back
than
belgian
counterparts
the
initial
flavours
get
complimenting
resulting
in
a
nice
complexity
with
strong
acidity
a
dash
of
what
is
getting
already
quite
close
to
vinegar
maybe
dash
of
apple
vinegar
not
so
much
the
fruit
but
a
mellowness
that
encompasses
the
vinegar
just
as
with
apple
vinegar
compared
to
regular
one
heavily
acidic
brief
moment
in
the
end
of
bitterness
quite
interesting
makes
me
think
a
bit
of
a
small
instance
of
bitter
herbal
farmhouse
hops
touch
dry
lightly
fizzy
touch
3f
style
in
that
department
easy
going
makes
you
want
to
drink
more
outstanding
lots
of
interesting
flavours
component
some
touch
newer
to
me
on
part
with
the
stuff
that
we
make
here
which
may
not
be
that
special
anymore
if
the
states
are
filled
with
this
kind
of
stuff
i
wish
the
allagash
coolship
series
was
a
little
more
attainable
props
to
them
for
bringing
openair
spontaneous
fermentation
to
the
us
not
sure
if
this
is
a
textbook
gueuze
but
it
does
at
least
maintain
the
spirit
of
blending
old
and
new
very
oakforward
deep
layers
of
tart
funk
cheese
must
and
tons
of
very
active
bugs
a
great
american
geuze
it
certainly
rivals
the
belgian
geuzes
in
terms
of
the
complexity
of
the
nose
and
flavour
as
well
as
the
excellent
carbonation
and
mouthfeel
allagash
sours
are
probably
the
closest
you
can
get
to
the
belgian
styles
of
sours
in
america
and
this
beer
reflects
that
fact
very
good
gueuze
especially
for
an
americanmade
good
funk
and
reasonable
level
of
sour
acidity
was
appreciated
o
this
is
a
style
i
just
dont
get
cheers
this
may
be
the
best
gueuze
i
have
had
i
think
i
prefer
this
to
cantillon
blasphemy
well
done
allagash
keep
them
coming
its
great
how
the
white
pays
for
such
great
beers
as
this
wow
this
was
deliciousextremely
cheesy
as
if
it
has
been
aged
for
10
yrs
incredible
balance
between
sour
and
funk
probably
the
best
american
geuze
i
have
ever
had
very
similar
to
belgian
geuze
o
this
is
really
nice
certainly
my
favorite
american
spontaneous
blend
so
far
much
far
ahead
of
beatification
and
sour
reserve
overall
wish
i
didnt
drive
6
hours
south
or
had
somebody
else
to
buy
another
4
bottles
as
thats
what
the
limit
was
would
feel
like
a
19
year
old
again
asking
other
people
to
buy
me
beer
overall
a
really
great
american
sour
definitely
comparable
to
many
of
the
belgian
gueuze
available
the
balance
of
funk
and
sour
is
really
impressive
ive
had
a
couple
different
batches
of
this
beer
now
and
none
fail
to
impress
overall
its
great
having
a
brewery
so
close
that
makes
such
good
sours
overall
complex
and
beautiful
i
cant
help
but
wonder
how
this
will
age
there
is
a
strong
head
flowing
after
the
pour
and
this
is
highly
effervesant
with
beautiful
acidity
and
vibrant
fruit
and
earthdriven
flavors
outstanding
almost
classic
served
in
an
allagash
tumbler
nose
is
pretty
cheesy
and
funky
light
acidity
mild
skunk
quite
authentic
super
dry
one
of
the
best
american
sours
bit
too
skunky
this
was
extremely
promising
and
i
really
am
looking
forward
to
seeing
what
allagash
can
do
with
this
beer
going
into
the
future
i
have
very
high
hopes
for
what
batches
10
and
beyond
could
be
beer
is
light
and
dry
quite
funky
mildly
sour
mostly
funky
though
it
is
interesting
though
a
nice
beer
for
sure
id
have
it
again
simple
but
good
375ml
bottle
this
one
pours
a
hazy
dark
golden
color
there
was
a
small
fizzy
head
that
didnt
linger
long
no
lacing
either
interesting
nose
definitely
funky
seems
to
be
sour
apple
and
lemon
are
the
main
components
maybe
some
wheat
but
its
hard
to
tell
the
taste
is
definitely
a
bit
sour
wheat
lemon
and
apple
notes
not
much
carbonation
at
all
there
is
a
smoothness
to
go
along
with
the
tartness
very
good
i
enjoyed
this
but
ive
enjoyed
others
more
it
is
a
must
try
but
it
probably
wont
blow
you
away
the
beer
appears
light
golden
colored
with
a
thin
wispy
head
that
leaves
faint
traces
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
brings
some
nice
funk
along
with
earth
grass
hay
straw
outdoors
mineral
water
smells
very
enticing
nicely
done
the
flavor
is
clean
and
refreshing
with
a
subtle
and
elegant
lactic
presence
followed
by
a
mildly
acetic
finish
not
on
par
with
the
elite
gueuzes
from
belgium
but
a
very
nice
beer
and
undoubtedly
one
of
the
better
attempts
from
an
american
brewery
light
bodied
and
easy
drinking
overall
this
was
solid
and
enjoyable
i
would
have
this
again
overall
as
good
as
any
american
sour
ive
had
not
as
good
as
the
best
belgian
counterparts
but
fantastic
for
an
american
brewery
to
produce
something
so
authentic
tasting
enjoyable
beer
but
fails
to
live
up
the
standards
of
the
belgian
lambic
makers
i
enjoy
sourness
but
this
one
was
a
touch
over
the
top
fwiw
if
this
were
classified
as
an
american
wild
ale
id
probably
rate
it
a
halfpoint
higher
however
as
a
gueuze
i
think
it
misses
the
style
a
bit
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
golden
yellow
with
a
thin
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
the
nose
is
super
dank
with
notes
of
foot
in
a
sandle
a
slight
citrusylemony
bitterness
and
funk
the
taste
is
a
sweet
upfront
with
a
great
tangerine
grapefruit
rind
bitterness
and
tartness
that
follows
the
beer
is
relatively
sweet
medium
bodied
but
drinkable
with
a
tart
dry
finish
that
lingers
the
beer
was
nearly
repulsive
with
a
sample
size
bctc
but
utterly
phenomenal
with
a
healthy
sample
size
get
some
o
great
sour
puckers
my
mouth
definitely
prefer
the
727
over
the
525
4
5
185th
tart
citrusy
pretty
acidic
but
not
overly
sour
funky
farmhouse
yeast
mild
bitterness
citrus
closer
to
the
belgian
gueuze
style
than
most
american
blenders
get
totally
respectable
quite
tasty
this
is
one
of
the
few
american
sours
i
think
the
belgian
blendmasters
would
actually
appreciate
pours
a
hazy
gold
color
with
a
white
head
really
just
a
decent
aroma
a
surprising
cork
note
along
with
moderate
funk
qualities
mostly
feet
and
grass
a
decent
bit
of
oak
and
actually
a
bit
of
sweet
wheat
smell
the
flavor
has
a
more
pronounced
funk
to
it
lots
of
must
sweat
and
grass
prominent
oak
flavors
with
only
a
light
tartness
and
lemon
peel
o
this
was
very
enjoyable
but
it
doesnt
hold
a
candle
to
its
belgian
counterparts
thanks
again
michael
d
this
was
definitely
the
coolship
that
was
most
authentic
and
lambiclike
it
compared
quite
favorably
to
cantillon
classic
gueuze
which
unfortunately
isnt
my
favorite
gueuze
to
begin
with
still
an
impressive
achievement
in
historical
authenticity
and
blending
skill
i
suspect
subsequent
releases
will
improve
rapidly
as
allagash
has
more
barrels
from
which
to
select
really
impressive
overall
it
doesnt
touch
some
of
the
better
gueuze
blends
from
belgium
and
its
not
on
the
same
level
as
beatification
at
this
point
but
its
better
than
almost
any
american
attempt
at
the
style
this
is
very
delicious
tastes
authentic
enough
to
me
o
so
overall
this
beer
both
bottlings
of
it
are
just
delicious
whether
with
subtle
grapefruit
or
lime
each
sip
is
a
spectacular
harmonic
dance
of
oak
funk
and
almost
mouth
puckering
sourtartness
so
incredibly
worth
the
money
o
one
of
my
favorite
coolships
right
up
there
with
the
red
i
would
definitely
go
after
another
one
of
these
to
see
how
it
ages
really
cool
how
it
stood
up
against
the
cantillon
counterpart
good
stuff
o
this
beer
is
up
there
with
some
of
the
best
geuzes
ive
had
well
done
allagash
taste
has
a
nice
sour
tartness
that
tickles
the
sides
of
the
tongue
a
funk
starts
to
work
its
way
in
the
flavor
profile
before
the
sourness
regains
its
foothold
in
my
mouth
moderately
soft
carbonation
slightly
earthy
undertones
a
leafygreen
funk
flavor
definitely
dirtyearthy
lemon
acidity
and
apple
tartness
wonderful
american
representation
of
a
traditional
beer
it
isnt
quite
the
same
this
bottled
release
was
earthier
than
what
ive
had
before
m
light
and
tight
all
the
way
extremely
drinkable
and
leaves
a
wetdry
finish
that
balances
so
well
with
the
tart
aftertaste
o
this
might
be
the
most
impressive
coolship
yet
allagash
is
really
on
to
something
and
beer
lovers
are
reaping
the
rewards
overall
amazing
tasty
nice
sour
and
tart
flavors
nice

and
bready

tart
acidic
lemon
juice
herbal

tangy

o
overall
a
pretty
good
american
gueuze
and
really
glad
i
got
to
try
it
very
funky
which
i
enjoyed
would
love
to
have
it
again
as
i
wrote
these
notes
and
reading
over
them
now
i
am
struck
by
how
this
beer
while
being
a
geuze
differs
in
a
number
of
ways
from
belgian
geuzes
its
difficult
to
rate
it
to
style
since
it
is
an
american
geuze
and
there
isnt
much
history
for
this
style
in
this
country
hence
my
ratings
are
much
lower
than
brewedawakenings
even
though
we
both
enjoyed
the
beer
to
a
similar
degree
and
shared
the
same
bottle
i
do
hope
that
allagash
keeps
up
with
this
product
line
and
makes
it
more
easily
available
for
this
is
a
fine
beer
and
deserves
to
be
tried
by
beer
lovers
far
and
wide
d
this
is
an
excellent
gateway
beer
for
those
who
want
to
experience
a
sour
but
dont
want
the
highly
acidic
qualities
overall
i
feel
this
was
an
extremely
impressive
representation
of
allagashs
interpretation
of
this
style
with
use
of
the
natural
airborn
wild
yeasts
found
in
the
great
state
of
maine
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
good
beer
and
good
example
of
the
style
the
more
i
try
this
style
the
more
i
start
to
understand
what
sets
this
style
apart
and
as
far
as
i
can
tell
this
has
just
about
everything
that
a
good
geuze
should
have
and
i
enjoyed
it
this
beer
has
good
drinkability
its
smooth
not
too
acidic
very
crisp
a
little
prickly
not
too
filling
and
the
taste
did
a
nice
job
at
holding
my
attention
the
whole
bottle
might
be
a
little
too
much
for
me
so
i
think
one
glass
is
the
perfect
amount
what
i
like
the
most
about
this
beer
is
the
sourness
its
right
where
i
want
it
for
the
style
what
i
like
the
least
about
this
beer
was
the
slight
skunky
aspect
i
wish
they
wouldnt
use
green
bottles
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
and
i
would
be
nice
to
keep
a
bottle
or
two
around
in
the
cellar
i
think
it
would
be
a
nice
summer
beer
and
it
might
even
be
a
little
refreshing
i
would
recommend
this
beer
especially
if
your
into
the
style
or
sour
beers
in
general
all
in
all
i
was
happy
with
this
beer
it
took
me
a
few
yeasrs
and
a
couple
tries
to
warm
up
to
it
but
now
i
can
say
i
enjoy
it
and
i
like
to
seek
out
more
in
the
style
this
beer
made
for
a
good
first
impression
and
i
would
really
like
to
try
more
beers
from
this
brewery
as
far
as
i
can
tell
its
an
above
average
example
of
the
style
good
job
guys
this
is
a
tasty
geuze
keep
up
the
hard
work
the
lingering
sweetness
is
a
bit
of
a
drawback
but
the
acidity
is
quite
nice
probably
a
safe
bet
among
the
less
exciting
gueuzes
first
time
trying
this
style
of
beer
not
my
kind
of
thing
probably
a
very
good
example
of
it
style
though
no
off
flavours
nice
clean
simple
sour
no
special
flavors
but
also
no
off
flavors
o
this
is
a
very
satisfying
geuze
very
refreshing
and
extremely
drinkable
very
nice
pours
hazy
light
amber
in
color
with
a
big
fuzzy
white
head
smell
has
some
peppery
yeast
notes
straw
and
grainy
malt
light
funky
acidic
lacto
sour
flavor
follows
with
lemon
peel
and
slight
vinegar
notes
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
highly
carbonated
and
crisp
overall
pretty
tame
but
pleasant
geuze
this
one
was
a
really
excellent
gueuze
style
lambic
it
had
tonnes
of
flavour
and
sourness
but
held
a
good
balance
and
proved
an
easy
one
to
drink
im
kicking
myself
for
only
buying
a
250ml
bottle
when
larger
ones
were
available
but
i
guess
that
just
means
ill
need
to
pick
this
one
up
again
at
some
point
overall
must
buy
more
geuze
im
actually
going
to
use
the
bottle
dregs
to
propagate
a
colony
of
bacteria
for
my
house
sours
i
love
what
frank
boon
is
doing
over
there
i
originally
reviewed
his
regular
boon
geuze
with
an
under
developed
palate
this
is
a
must
try
for
all
craft
beer
lovers
looking
for
something
off
the
beaten
path
long
live
sour
beers
pours
a
orange
body
with
one
finger
head
and
no
lace
with
a
tart
acidic
aroma
with
touches
of
funk
and
oak
the
fruit
flavors
in
this
beer
come
across
as
white
grape
and
pear
basically
there
are
little
bits
of
sweetness
balanced
with
a
funky
almost
sour
tart
dryness
that
leaves
a
crisp
finish
the
oakwood
keeps
beer
smooth
and
pleasant
overall
the
balance
in
this
beer
makes
it
quite
enjoyable
light
on
the
funk
tart
and
flavor
complexities
but
a
great
introduction
to
the
style
tart
no
sweetness
slight
funk
direct
highly
drinkable
one
of
my
all
time
favorite
sours
sad
its
not
more
widely
available
4050
o
the
fruit
here
is
bright
citric
lemons
and
such
this
is
a
rock
solid
example
of
the
gueuze
a
blended
lambic
that
focuses
on
the
funk
and
sour
elements
that
sometimes
are
backgrounded
in
the
more
friendly
standard
lambics

fantastic
though
it
could
do
with
more
head
scents
of
wild
barnyard
brett

with
notes
of
hay
and
lemon

layered
atop
aromas
of
grapefruit

overall
impression
is
of
a
modestly
sour

mingling
wonderfully
with
the
other

spicy
yeast
phenols
mild
grainy

and
a
bit
of

overall
impression
of
flavor
is
of
a
nicely
sour
wellbalanced
geuze
that
is
a
good
showcase
of
the
typical
flavors
of
the
style
quite
pleasant
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
puckering
and
somewhat
drying
with
high
effervescent
carbonation
overall
impression
of
mouthfeel
is
of
a
light
spritzy
but
not
watery
feel
very
true
to
style
and
quite
pleasant
overall
this
is
a
fine
geuze
it
is
not
the
best
example
of
the
style
but
it
is
true
to
form
pleasant
in
aroma
flavor
and
mouthfeel
and
as
a
result
is
quite
pleasant
to
drink
i
recommend
it
to
those
wanting
to
try
a
fairly
good
example
of
a
geuze
50100
serving
type
bottle
overall
its
a
good
well
balanced
drink
that
doesnt
try
and
take
the
sour
to
the
max
floral
slightly
funky
brett
aroma
with
a
fairly
sour
lactic
and
acetic
finish
one
of
the
better
traditional
belgian
examples
of
the
style
i
think
and
one
of
the
primary
reasons
for
that
is
its
balance
not
just
a
lactic
acidity
sour
bomb
this
has
a
ton
of
flavor
and
nuance
to
go
with
the
sour
the
malt
also
seems
to
be
a
bit
darker
than
others
less
yellow
more
amber
which
gives
some
meat
to
it
alcohol
is
also
a
bit
higher
than
others
an
indication
of
its
dryness
and
doneness
in
the
yeast
sense
hazy
with
fish
food
flakes
of
brick
red
yeast
floating
around
and
finally
settling
under
an
airy
white
head
the
nose
smells
as
woody
as
it
does
sour
very
mature
with
plenty
of
funky
yeast
weirdness
in
addition
to
the
lacto
of
the
lambic
the
blend
is
nice
too
a
proper
mix
of
old
and
young
with
just
enough
sourness
to
fit
the
style
but
not
so
much
that
i
dont
want
to
drink
my
whole
bottle
i
love
the
fuller
body
and
all
the
carbonation
a
lot
of
these
come
across
still
this
appears
to
be
bottle
conditioned
which
gives
it
a
lot
of
life
less
traditional
to
some
but
i
really
do
prefer
it
personally
oak
and
dusty
malt
meet
where
the
sourness
really
kicks
in
and
it
warms
up
well
driving
the
sourness
up
a
bit
more
on
par
with
any
of
the
blended
lambics
from
belgium
i
think
and
the
price
point
is
awesome
overy
nice
gueze
for
the
price
will
pick
this
up
again
pours
from
the
bottle
with
a
cloudy
golden
yelloworange
color
and
is
topped
by
a
massive
pillowy
eggshellwhite
head
the
aroma
is
a
lively
combination
of
apple
cider
vinegar
and
damp
earth
the
flavor
is
likewise
acidic
yet
earthy
with
components
of
tart
white
grape
juice
sour
green
apples
and
a
light
woodiness
the
lively
sharp
fine
carbonation
accents
the
acidicy
and
yet
this
beer
is
surprisingly
palatecoating
overall
this
beer
reminds
me
more
of
a
tart
white
wine
but
in
a
most
intriguing
way
o
a
staple
very
good
sour
and
neutral
oak
as
it
should
this
is
very
consistent
between
metrics
this
is
certainly
recommended
to
sour
fans
big
and
belgian
thats
how
i
like
them
not
in
a
gay
way
not
that
theres
anything
wrong
with
that
just
sayin
it
pours
cloudy
gold
with
a
soapy
white
head
that
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
before
im
ready
to
go
further
it
smells
of
oranges
peppermint
hay
and
a
barn
a
particular
one
not
just
any
one
but
i
will
keep
the
location
secret
just
to
be
that
way
the
taste
is
sour
cherries
grass
and
a
nice
bready
finish
this
is
a
phenomenally
balanced
flavor
not
too
sour
not
too
sweet
not
too
dry
it
is
the
goldilocks
of
geuze
if
they
start
putting
that
on
the
label
i
get
credit
the
mouthfeel
is
soft
slightly
tingly
and
light
overall
i
really
feel
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
it
may
be
the
best
ive
had
nice
nice
job
carbonation
is
a
bit
over
the
top
o
a
nice
lambic
for
the
price
but
strangely
havent
seen
this
around
as
much
as
other
more
sought
after
geuzes
i
guess
that
kinda
makes
sense
but
a
little
variety
never
hurts
for
perspective
a
nice
beer
that
is
worth
trying
and
seeking
bottle
poured
into
my
duvel
tulip
poured
brilliant
dandelion
yellow
with
a
slight
tangerine
hue
frothy
white
head
that
left
several
patches
of
lacing
wonderful
aromas
of
citrus
tartness
touch
of
leather
big
earthy
tones
like
walking
through
a
deciduous
forest
after
a
fresh
spring
rain
and
you
come
upon
a
rotting
log
with
mushrooms
growing
on
it
very
delicate
yet
powerful
flavors
very
smooth
carbonation
giving
a
lively
feel
to
the
light
body
delicious
dont
really
like
it
sorry
overall
the
beer
was
quite
an
experience
at
taste
and
smell
i
was
fearful
i
wouldnt
like
it
but
like
all
great
things
it
grew
on
me
as
i
sipped
it
and
maybe
as
it
opened
up
a
bit
overall
very
drinkable
sour
ok
but
missing
something
more
gets
old
too
fast

a
hazy

mayhaps
an

but

im
warming
up
quickly
to
the
style
grapefruit
is
the
dominant
player
here
with
assorted
citrus
in
the
mix
lemons
apples
barnyard
funk
supremely
sour
on
both
the
nose
and
the
palate
though
not
as
acidic
as
other
brews
in
this
vein
actually
somewhat
sweet
at
the
tip
of
the
tongue
with
bread
and
apple
candy
the
sourness
doesnt
quite
have
the
flavor
or
the
potency
i
crave
but
its
a
nicely
rounded
beer
pours
cloudy
gold
with
a
fourfinger
white
head
that
retains
well
the
nose
is
straw
lemon
dank
earthy
yeast
funk
and
candied
sugar
the
taste
gives
some
straw
and
candied
sugar
up
front
before
becoming
a
sour
lemon
bomb
its
like
youre
drinking
a
warhead
the
body
is
light
and
watery
with
high
carbonation
and
it
finishes
dry
not
interesting
enough
to
warrant

the
taste
is
tart
from
the

yeast
forward
with
acidic
almost
more
than
any
readily
available
gueuze
i
can
remember
in
belgium
or
the
u
s
for
that
matter
the
taste
of
the
wood
with
the
sour
yeast
brings
a
sort
of
tannic
element
to
the
light
dry
body
with
an
alcohol
flavor
that
is
noticeable
and
becomes
almost
spicy
but
not
sharp
to
the
extent
of
not
being
enjoyable
enjoyment
and
flavor
converge
this
is
stronger
than
your
average
gueuze
but
to
me
does
not
lack
flavor
in
any
sense
it
is
perhaps
not
as
subtle
as
some
but
every
bit
as
good
and
worth
seeking
out
perhaps
a
good
candidate
for
cellaring
based
on
the
slightly
higher
abv
either
way
it
is
drinkable

if

subite
verdict
a
nice
gueuze
from
boon
and
the
lambikstoempers
arguably
one
of
the
better
gueuzes
that
ive
had
from
boon
its
a
bit
richer
and
heavier
and
certainly
on
the
sweeter
side
but
its
very
crisp
and
clean
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
overall
this
is
something
special
the
flavors
are
so

to

reasonable
in

range
o
great
beer
dry
and
easy
to
drink
i
will
try
it
again
not
too
familiar
with
many
geueze
lambics
but
if
the
flavor
characteristics
for
this
style
are
funky
and
sour
then
they
hit
the
mark
this
is
a
very
tart
dry
beer
that
is
also
very
refreshing
almost
like
a
sour
grapefruit
without
the
sweet
no
hop
bitterness
whatsoever
definitely
has
that
aged
oaky
dry
finish
will
seek
out
more
of
this
style
but
sparingly
can
get
pretty
pricey
for
just
one
bottle
definitly
an
acquired
taste
having
not
too
long
ago
discovered
this
style
i
find
it
to
not
be
very
available
where
i
live
i
expect
to
try
again
at
some
point
when
possible
remarks
did
not
score
a
t
s
m
at
that
time
so
please
disregard
those
scores
definitely
a
nice
gueuze
considering
the
availability
dont
expect
the
quality
and
taste
of
cantillon
drie
fonteinen
or
even
russian
river
but
this
is
certainly
a
decent
gueuze
given
the
fact
that
its
readily
available
at
your
local
beer
store
for
67
better
than
lindenmans
cuvee
rene
in
my
opinion
a
good
beginner
gueuze
to
get
your
friends
into
funky
beers
owhile
i
say
this
is
not
my
favorite
sour
beer
my
local
grocery
store
carries
it
at
a
very
reasonable
price
so
i
can
imagine
it
being
a
default
summer
drink
at
home
beer
and
it
is
definitely
growing
on
me
the
body
is
light
which
works
well
for
this
one
with
as
constant
a
crispness
as
the
carbonation
would
lead
one
to
expect
its
also
as
dry
as
one
might
expect
othis
is
an
interesting
beer
that
seems
to
be
a
cross
between
a
light
ale
and
champagne
a
style
that
i
would
like
to
explore
a
little
bit
more
o
perfectly
fine
geuze
and
widely
available
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
very
enjoyable
with
a
steak
its
missing
something
o
i
know
this
is
a
famously
awesome
beer
and
even
though
i
cant
describe
it
well
i
am
a
big
fan
possibly
my
entrance
into
the
world
of
the
sours
a
really
good
geuze
brings
the
funk
and
style
that
one
would
want
from
a
geuze
overall
my
first
gueuze
on
my
22nd
birthday
so
it
was
pretty
awesome
not
like
a
beer
at
alldifferent
but
refreshing
and
very
good
not
too
sour
at
all
my
friend
who
doesnt
even
drink
beer
liked
it
so
much
and
called
me
a
week
later
asking
where
he
can
get
some
of
that
booze
gooze
o
smooth
there
is
a
woody
quality
that
shows
up
a
bit
in
the
finish
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
musty
taste
in
the
beginning
but
it
fades
and
the
rest
of
the
taste
is
quite
nice
4
overall
a
bit
strange
for
me
ive
never
had
such
a
sweet
lambic
before
i
need
to
research
the
actual
date
of
the
body
to
better
understand
how
this
beer
may
have
matured
id
be
willing
to
try
it
again
but
would
like
to
find
a
very
fresh
bottle
as
a
comparison
cantillon
is
still
my
top
geuze
taste
is
well
balanced
with
a
light
sour
and
very
earthy
slightly
vegetal
flavor
mouthfeel
is
light
and
carbonated
lightly
for
a
smooth
mouthfeel
the
beer
appears
hazy
and
rusty
orange
hued
with
a
half
inch
of
white
head
the
aroma
is
decent
with
notes
of
hay
funk
oak
the
flavor
is
earthy
and
oaky
and
much
sweeter
than
i
expected
not
as
delicate
or
smooth
on
the
palate
as
i
was
hoping
sharpness
in
the
finish
half
the
bottle
remained
the
next
day
which
is
a
tell
tale
sign
since
my
house
is
like
a
gueuze
vacuum
id
be
willing
to
try
it
again
hopeful
of
a
different
result
o
overall
a
decent
gueuze
but
not
one
of
my
favorites
seemed
a
little
old
and
oxidized
but
surprised
it
hadnt
held
up
well
nose
was
nice
and
funky
and
would
be
willing
to
try
again
maybe
as
a
fresher
bottle
as
you
let
it
sit
and
sip
it
it
transforms
into
something
even
better
kind
of
like
the
truck
transforming
into
optimus
prime
the
funky
flavors
come
out
without
adding
sourness
while
i
dont
have
much
of
a
basis
for
comparison
as
this
is
the
first
gueuze
i
have
ever
had
this
seems
to
be
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
in
addition
to
being
extremely
tasty
im
sure
i
will
be
drinking
more
of
this
in

a
bit
lighter
then
i
was
expecting
but
still
tremendously
good
rich
nose
of
tart
apple
vinegar
sour
grapes
and
a
touch
of
wet
hay
enormously
complex
as
it
warms
it
comes
across
with
a
light
wheat
or
herbal
like
quality
and
just
the
tiniest
amount
of
spice
prickling
the
nose
the
flavor
was
more
of
the
same
rich
notes
of
sour
and
biting
vinegar
flavor
coming
across
on
it
right
away
light
grapes
and
even
a
touch
of
wheat
coming
through
mid
palate
especially
as
it
starts
to
warm
mellow
grassy
flavors
are
mingling
very
well
within
the
flavor
now
o
a
nice
introductory
geuze
not
outstanding
but
very
good
it
was
a
nice
pairing
with
dessert
best
before

2025
or

couldnt
make
out
the
last
number
served
from
bottle
into
a
green
man
snifter
poured
yelloworange
with
a
minimal
slightly
offwhite
head
there
was
no
lacing
evident
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
wood
funk
and
cherries
the
flavor
was
of
swet
malt
wood
funk
slight
tart
very
subtle
mothballs
and
cherries
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
mediumhigh
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
nice
brew
i
wish
i
would
have
been
able
to
read
the
last
digit
on
the
date
to
get
an
idea
on
the
age
of
this
one
seemed
fairly
fresh
though
based
on
the
flavors
i
could
however
see
this
one
evolving
very
nicely
over
time
great
aroma
and
good
flavor
going
on
here
a
definite
must
try
d
a
very
nice
example
of
the
style
delicious
went
extremely
well
with
some
fresh
goat
cheese
i
plan
on
trying
more
of
this
style
this
is
a
good
segway
into
sour
adn
tart
beers
notes
boon
makes
a
pretty
solid
gueuze
its
a
lightbodied
brew
and
very
refreshing
definitely
better
than
other
offerings
from
this
brewery
balanced
from
start
to
finish
another
excellent
gueuze
d
as
horrible
as
all
the
descriptors
ive
used
are
i
can
see
how
this
could
be
an
acquired
taste
not
entirely
unpleasant
i
guess
it
isnt
all
that
bad
since
this
is
my
first
geuze
i
have
no
idea
if
this
is
a
bad
bottle
or
if
it
is
indeed
supposed
to
taste
like
this
shrug
id
try
it
again
preferably
in
the
company
of
a
geuze
guru
unless
the
bottles
vary
widely
and
are
occasionally
amazing
i
see
no
reason
to
ever
buy
this
when
you
can
get
better
geuezes
or
other
wild
ales
for
comparable
or
lower
prices
it
really
was
a
mess
the
lack
of
sourness
or
tartness
really
highlighted
the
fact
that
the
majority
of
what
was
happening
in
the
taste
was
brett
as
dirt
and
surprising
bitterness
the
most
boring
wild
ale
ive
ever
had
pours
a
nice
hazy
golden
yellow
with
a
bit
of
white
wispy
head
wonderful
funky
and
floral
nose
citric
and
delicious
taste
isnt
quite
as
tart
as
i
was
hoping
for
it
seems
a
bit
restrained
still
very
clean
and
good
as
far
as
the
flavor
profile
goes
a
bit
of
funk
some
nice
crisp
lemon
edge
to
it
some
malt
poking
through
over
a
long
dry
finish
mouthfeel
was
prickly
and
light
pretty
standard
for
a
good
geueze
good
drinkability
it
was
a
nice
beer
to
have
with
my
dinner
i
was
glad
to
have
gotten
to
try
it
d
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
could
of
downed
this
whole
bottle
in
one
swoop
this
was
surprisingly
incredibly
easy
to
drink
and
my
stomach
was
not
buggin
after
a
few
ounces
or
so
great
stuff
at
a
great
price
at
least
at
wfs
pours
relatively
clear
golden
with
a
light
head
aromas
are
tropical
with
some
pineapple
and
cantaloupe
flavor
is
a
blend
of
diet
oranginasprite
and
jolly
rancher
crisp
and
refreshing
though
not
terribly
complex
for
a
gueueze
a
sour
finish
with
a
slight
tealike
astringency
this
is
a
reasonable
gueuze
but
if
you
have
a
selection
opt
for
the
cantillon
or
girardin
flavor
is
decent
but
not
the
best
gueuze
out
there
full
of
sharp
tartness
and
citrus
notes
funk
is
great
but
the
whole
flavor
seems
a
little
watered
down
or
something
theres
also
an
earhty
fresh
cut
grass
characteristic
that
resides
heavely
in
the
aftertaste
the
oak
aging
is
also
very
noticable
as
theres
definite
wood
notes
light
and
crisp
mouthfeel
and
high
carbonation
again
a
nice
gueuze
not
the
best
drinkability
nice
example
of
a
gueuze
at
an
affordable
price
not
as
high
level
as
cantillon
but
a
very
enjoyable
drinker
i
see
more
of
these
in
my
future
aging
some
to
see
what
happens
on
a
spectrum
from
cantillon
to
lindemans
sour
to
sweet
boon
would
fall
one
quarter
past
the
latter
towards
the
former
the
intense
sourness
is
there
but
the
extreme
puckering
dryness
is
not
that
is
by
no
means
supposed
to
be
a
knock
just
a
point
of
reference
this
was
a
very
enjoyable
gueuze
d
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
that
i
would
have
again
but
i
wont
be
seeking
out
more
any
time
soon
overall
this
is
one
heck
of
a
strong
representation
of
this
style
i
have
a
hard
time
finding
any
faults
with
it
and
it
just
seems
to
improve
as
it
passes
cellar
temperature
and
approaches
the
ambient
air
temperature
a
good
one
to
share
as
are
most
old
lambics
due
to
the
acidic
sourness
easy
drinking
this
would
work
well
with
a
oil
and
vinegar
ceasar
salad
this
beer
is
a
little
pricey
but
it
is
true
to
the
authentic
style
not
amazing
but
certainly
a
classic
thin
mouthfeel
with
a
champagne
like
consistency
and
strong
carbonation
overall
not
the
best
of
the
gueuze
category
but
solid
d
very
luxurious
pairs
exceptionally
well
a
very
nice
example
of
the
style
overall
this
is
ok
probably
a
good
geuze
for
a
beginner
it
gives
you
a
little
funk
but
allows
it
to
be
very
drinkable
drinkability
a
very
good
and
tasty
gueuze
i
could
have
two
or
three
i
like
the
dry
apple
taste
d
a
very
well
rounded
geueze
which
was
enjoyed
to
the
fullest
extent
will
get
more
of
this
tasty
beer
for
later
and
cellering
this
is
my
first
brew
of
this
style
and
its
a
nice
introduction
to
sour
beers
its
fairly
approachable
and
goes
down
nicely
interesting
that
this
is
their
regular
gueuze
not
the
oude
version
yet
seems
to
follow
the
traditionaloude
style
and
doesnt
appear
to
be
sweetened
i
suppose
that
deserves
some
credit
md
light
body
with
dry
tart
aftertaste
this
style
of
beer
i
always
find
incredibly
drinkable
and
this
is
a
great
example
of
one
notes
outstanding
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
drinkability
was
slow
for
me
i
need
to
get
used
to
it
ill
retry
when
i
appreciate
the
style
more
later
it
certainly
has
no
complxity
because
it
has
almost
no
flavour
profile
at
all
its
ok
and
i
can
see
why
someone
who
enjoys
just
having
tartness
or
sourness
might
like
it
but
i
get
almost
no
funky
yeasty
character
or
anything
else
and
i
see
no
point
in
ever
drinking
anything
that
has
so
little
taste
i
might
as
well
drink
tap
water
pours
a
somewhat
hazy
strawyellow
with
a
thick
and
not
persistent
white
head
not
very
inspiring
but
this
is
the
beers
weakest
point
aroma
is
quite
strong
yeasty
with
malty
and
fruity
undertones
flavor
is
rich
and
crisp
malty
with
a
good
sourapple
component
and
a
touch
of
hops
texture
is
edgy
and
fizzy
leaving
a
pleasantly
sour
aftertaste
wishing
i
would
have
picked
up
quite
a
few
more
at
clearout
prices
very
carbonated
big

golden
orangeyellow
in

has
a
bit
of
a
hay
and
barnyard
smell
intense
funky
lemon
sourness
in
the
taste
this
was
my
very
first
gueze
and
i
loved
it
from
a
750
ml
bottle
this
brew
poured
a
hazy
straw
color
with
a
towering
white
head
beautiful
lace
and
a
yeastycloudy
character
to
the
liquid
the
aroma
is
at
first
barnyard
like
but
also
sweet
and
fruity
apple
and
pear
the
barnyard
horselike
funk
is
good
but
could
be
a
little
more
intense
the
taste
is
moderately
sour
but
quite
balanced
its
not
the
puckeryourlips
eyesquintingly
sour
that
i
expected
its
very
well
balanced
and
quite
drinkable
wheat
yeast
and
fruit
flavors
dominate
the
flavor
spritzy
and
light
in
body
despite
the
fact
that
i
first
found
it
a
little
shy
for
a
lambic
this
is
a
very
nice
geuze
i
could
not
drink
this
beer
regularly
but
when
paired
with
food
the
possibilities
really
open
up
d
this
is
the
second
gueze
ive
ever
had
i
think
that
cuvee
renee
was
much
better
this
one
lacked
a
diverse
flavor
profile
bought
in
orlando
at
knightly
spirits
and
drank
in
austin
sturdy
white
head
very
nice

with
a

very
refreshing
i
could
sit
back
and
sip
this
all
day
oh
but
you
didnt
mother
i
came
looking
for
you
every
night
i
found
you
months
ago
and
i
realized
im
happier
here
ill
watch
you
when
you
least
expect
it
but
im
never
coming
back
a
good
beer
probably
the
most
sour
one
ive
had
so
far
that
being
said
its
got
depth
beyond
the
sourness
that
produces
a
nice
crisp
beverage
not
really
my
bag
of
tea
but
i
appreciate
the
effort
12
oz
bottle
poured
into
a
duvel
tulip
dark
cloudy
goldenrod
with
a
humungous
offwhite
head
more
than
4
fingers
tall
excellent
retention
and
absurd
chunks
of
lacing
aroma
is
mostly
citrus
peel
and
lemony
sour
with
an
orangey
sweetness
to
it
huge
citric
acid
flavor
is
not
nearly
as
sour
as
the
aroma
some
of
the
lemony
tartness
is
definitely
still
there
but
bretty
funk
is
at
least
even
with
sournessacidity
in
the
overall
profile
earthy
and
saisonlike
at
times
nice
dry
finish

like

be

good
introtosours
beer
pours
an
impressive
golden
color
with
an
even
more
impressive
big
white
thick
fluffy
head
that
refuses
to
go
away
immediately
the
aroma
cues
my
senses
and
i
get
that
sour
puckering
reaction
like
when
you
anticipate
eating
a
warhead
it
is
super
funky
and
has
hints
of
citrus
and
leather
the
taste
intensifies
the
character
of
this
gueuze
on
the
palate
strong
funk
earth
and
bits
of
leather
come
to
mind
it
is
pleasantly
sour
and
very
drinkable
wonderful
beer
in
my
opinion
i
love
the
sourness
and
i
will
definitely
buy
this
again
good
stuff
my
first
geuze
definitely
wont
be
my
last
pours
a
clear
cedar
color
with
a
fizzy
head
and
no
lacing
the
nose
has
tart
fruits
cabdy
malts
and
some
subtle
oaky
funk
the
taste
has
a
bit
more
of
the
sour
citrus
component
which
is
well
balanced
by
the
malts
and
again
a
very
subtle
musky
wood
presence
light
body
is
well
carbonated
not
the
most
complex
but
a
fine
example
of
the
style
a
steal
at
5
a
bottle
should
age
well
for
many
years
to
come
unique
pairs
well
with
brie
i
recommend
you
do
the
same
d
tried
it
with
pan
seared
pheasant
with
a
brandy
and
apple
reduction
the
carbonation
detracted
so
we
switched
to
wine
oh
well
drinkability
is
good
here
but
not
as
nice
as
the
marraige
parfait
d
for
such
a
farremoved
style
from
the
majority
of
beers
available
this
is
very
drinkable
its
not
quite
session
material
due
to
the
intensity
of
foreign
flavors
but
it
certainly
isnt
over
the
top
drinkability
is
pretty
good
a
very
easy
drinking
gueze
although
not
my
favorite
as
i
prefer
more
lacto
still
damn
good
ive
got
more
in
the
cellar
and
look
forward
to
letting
them
age

really
nice
a
little
light

not

sour
kinda
watery
but
bubbly
at
the

time
i
wish
the
flavor
was
a
strong
as
the
aroma
d
a
very
easy
drinker
and
a
great
intro
to
sour
beers
as
many
in
my
party
would
attest
a
great
pairing
with
the
moules
and
frites
i
had
pure
heaven
any
opportunity
to
sip
a
beer
out
of
a

im
on
it
dark
glow
of
amber

these

are
so

im
all
about
awe
sour

drinkability
this
was
the
first
gueuze
i
ever
had
and
i
was
not
very
imperssed
i
might
buy
another
bottle
later
in
life
but
for
now
ill
stick
with
the
fruit
lambics
d
a
great
gueuze
tasty
and
drinkable
just
wish
they
werent
so
expensive
the
bottle
cost
me
8
bucks
poured
into
a
chimay
goblet
with
a
bit
of
yeast
it
is
a
nice
and
lively
looking
cloudy
golden
amber
with
a
quickly
dissipating
pure
white
head
the
aroma
is
pleasantly
sour
with
bits
of
lemon
rind
and
sour
grapes
the
taste
is
bitingly
sour
sour
apple
sour
grape
and
lemon
but
with
a
very
snappy
and
refreshingly
crisp
mouthfeel
i
am
having
a
rough
time
trying
to
think
of
other
things
to
say
about
this
beer
as
its
the
first
of
the
style
that
ive
tried
but
it
is
very
tasty
even
for
such
a
sour
beer
great
for
a
hot
day
highly
recommended
d
this
was
a
killer
beer
it
had
the
perfect
balance
of
sour
and
sweet
with
a
wonderful
complexity
and
mouthfeel
this
is
how
it
is
done
folks
all
in
all
a
great
traditional
lambic
and
one
that
i
would
drink
again
and
recommend
good
pucker
mildly
earthy
fine
balance
well
done
d
i
would
have
to
say
one
and
done
but
the
one
is
very
nice
pours
a
light
golden
with
a
big
white
fluffy
head
that
recedes
moderately
fast
not
really
sure
how
to
describe
this
other
than
sour
but
its
also
light
and
refreshing
with
a
nice
prickly
carbonation
i
really
enjoyed
this
sour
beer
and
although
ive
had
a
bunch
of
other
types
of
sours
this
was
actually
my
first
gueuze
i
will
say
that
this
is
my
first
review
of
a
gueuze
lambic
and
i
am
not
too
terribly
experienced
with
traditional
lamics
pours
a
very
carbonated
yelloworange
clear
with
good
carbonation
and
nice
fizzy
white
head
that
dissipates
pretty
quickly
nose
is
of
tart
vinous
flavors
taste
follows
nice
and
tart
but
not
a
sour
as
some
i
have
had
recently
drie
fonteinen
in
particular
nice
sour
wine
like
notes
and
good
carbonation
mouthfeel
seems
to
be
as
good
as
most
of
the
gueuze
i
have
tried
drinkability
is
good
considering
the
style
good
brew
i
am
just
getting
into
this
style
and
am
more
intrigued
after
this
one
looking
forward
to
drinking
the
other
one
in
the
cellar
in
2020
or
so
i
could
not
quaf
something
this
intense
but
had
no
problem
killing
a
small
bottle
in
under
12
an
hour
the
green
12
oz
corked
and
caged
bottle
was
picked
up
at
greens
and
warmed
up
to
cellar
temperature
before
opening
the
cork
came
out
readily
while
i
was
trying
to
insert
the
corkscrew
and
the
pour
was
bubbly
and
restrained
the
body
was
pale
yellow
with
a
lot
of
haze
the
smell
was
acidic
with
loads
of
barnyard
horse
blanket
due
to
the
wondrous
handiwork
of
the
wild
yeast
and
bacteria
the
taste
was
cidery
tart
oaky
bone
dry
and
not
quite
as
funky
as
the
other
geuzes
ive
tasted
before
very
refreshing
and
a
touch
thicker
than
most
blended
lambics
very
easy
to
drink
and
a
lot
more
approachable
due
to
the
lack
of
mouth
puckering
acidity
when
compared
to
cantillon
verdict
a
beer
that
lives
up
to
its
style
a
slow
sipper
that
doesnt
skimp
on
the
funk
i
like
it
for
what
it
is
d
interesting
question
as
to
drinkability
this
is
the
first
true
gueuze
ive
had
it
is
a
very
sour
beer
but
not
nearly
as
sour
as
a
true
sour
beer
think
duchesse
du
bourgogne
it
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
in
my
opinion
i
would
definitely
recommend
it
and
will
definitely
drink
it
again
but
only
after
ive
had
more
of
the
class
for
valid
comparison
drinkability
is
very
high
with
this
one
if
i
wasnt
such
a
fan
of
cantillion
i
would
say
this
is
an
excellent
geuze
but
there
are
more
extreme
versions
out
there
so
i
will
just
say
this
is
very
good
poured
into
la
chouffe
belgian
flute
head
faded
fast
with
no
brussels
lace
salty
tart
bretty
lambic
barnyard
funk
first
sip
tasted
like
a
dry
apple
juice
not
as
dry
as
champagne
but
had
a
dry
aftertaste
no
hops
present
and
only
a
small
malt
backbone
a
far
tamer
version
than
the
marriage
parfait
d
sweet
geuze
tastetexture
lemon
sour
apples
white

vinegar
tart
but
not
overly
acidic
the
finish
is
sour
and
dry
but
fairly
clean
extremely
crisp
on
the
tongue
and
very
refreshing
a
good
gueueze
with
high
drinkability
this
is
a
worldclass
example
of
the
style
nice
balance
and
subtle
complexities
i
recommend
it
both
to
beginners
and
veterans
of
the
style
nice
overall
no
hops
no
malt
all
lambic
and
really
good
as
funky
and
fantastic
as
it
gets
pick
one
up
drinkability
whenever
i
splurge
on
a
gueuze
i
always
marvel
at
how
much
i
like
them
im
quite
sure
that
just
one
short
year
ago
id
probably
have
hated
this
because
my
beer
palate
was
not
developed
enough
i
would
have
dismissed
it
as
too
champagnelike
im
not
a
fan
of
champagne
but
i
am
a
big
fan
of
this
and
others
like
it
complex
enjoyable
easy
to
drink
very
nice
this
beer
pours
a
pale
orange
color
the
head
is
massive
billowy
and
bright
white
with
an
orane
tint
the
aroma
is
of
lemons
orange
rind
hay
and
ha
a
nice
sourness
and
acidity
to
it
the
taste
is
of
less
sour
and
acidic
than
the
aroma
and
more
earthy
hay
and
barnyard
flavors
run
riot
with
some
zesty
orange
and
lemon
rind
in
there
too
the
mouthfeel
is
silky
smooth
with
nice
high
tingly
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
fine
gueuze
and
i
would
certainly
have
it
again
seems
like
a
good
solid
gueuze
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
on
a
hot
summer
day
but
i
wouldnt
seek
this
one
out
either
apparently
this
and
the
oude
geuze
are
the
same
as
it
is
a
combination
of
young
and
old
lambic
smell
of
yeast
and
alcohol
this
is
dry
sparkling
with
a
retaining
crowning
head
of
gold
onto
apple
juice
colour
taste
has
characteristics
of
apple
juice
and
much
better
deeper
in
the
meal
and
not
as
interesting
outiside
of
geuze
geeks
before
not
too
dry
nor
sweet
this
has
been
likened
to
champagne
interesting
different
wellcrafted
brew
but
certainly
not
outstanding
the
salty
taste
at
the
end
although
adding
complexity
limits
the
amount
one
can
have
pours
out
a
copper
color
and
looks
about
identical
to
an
apa
with
tons
of
carbonation
in
the
body
my
frist
2
pouring
attempts
ended
up
with
all
head
and
no
beer
so
once
the
third
chance
came
i
knew
to
pour
more
slowly
still
builds
a
massive
head
on
the
pour
and
it
actually
keeps
on
growing
even
after
a
minute
or
so
of
setting
the
glass
down
bubbles
are
really
fat
in
the
head
and
it
clings
to
the
glass
leaves
great
lacing
acidity
and
funk
are
all
there
but
they
arent
so
forceful
as
to
conceal
the
crackerlike
wheat
and
the
pale
malts
taste
is
tart
to
sour
upfront
while
an
odd
but
pleasing
astringency
washes
over
the
rest
of
the
tongue
very
dry
but
compared
to
some
other
geuzes
this
has
a
good
bit
of
residual
sweetness
not
as
harsh
as
id
hoped
this
one
to
be
mouthfeel
is
light
but
it
seems
all
the
carbonation
went
to
the
head
instead
of
staying
in
the
body
for
a
spritzier
mouthfeel
although
maybe
not
as
interesting
as
some
others
the
relative
mellow
character
of
this
really
lends
itself
well
to
high
drinkabiliy
overall
a
fine
lambic
nice
carbonation
on
the
tongue
drinkability
is
aboveaverage
the
sourness
prevents
it
from
going
down
particularly
quickly
pours
a
hazy
golden
small
white
head
forms
disappears
rather
quickly
sits
along
the
edges
of
the
glass
some

lacking

for

not
too
impressed
with
it
but
neat
nonetheless
drinkability
for
the
style
this
beer
excells
in
this
area
not
too
high
on
the
abv
and
plenty
of
flavor
if
you
can
get
and
afford
alot
of
this
go
ahead
and
get
a
bunch
would
make
a
good
night
drinkability
i
must
say
this
is
better
than
i
expected
as
this
is
my
first
geuze
i
was
a
bit
itimidated
with
the
general
description
of
the
style
found
around
the
web
and
books
i
dove
in
and
was
rewarded
im
really
lovin
the
flavor
and
wishing
it
wasnt
so
pricey
but
its
definatly
worth
it
for
the
care
taken
to
make
and
age
this
treat
recommended
and
i
cant
wait
to
try
some
of
the
more
intense
versions
of
the
style
cheers
if
you
like
this
type
of
beer
more
power
to
you
but
my
pallet
may
not
be
developed
enough
for
this
one
yet
i
will
have
to
work
on
that
drinkable
but
it
took
some
getting
used
too
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
offering
that
is
quite
unique
and
very
flavorful
this
one
is
certainly
not
for
everyone
out
there
but
if
you
are
looking
to
expand
your
pallet
certainly
give
this
one
a
try
the
first
geuze
i
tried
a
year
back
just
turned
me
off
maybe
it
was
all
the
other
great
ones
i
was
trying
as
well
or
maybe
it
was
such
a
different
experience
i
was
hesitant
coming
back
to
it
but
am
now
pleased
i
picked
opened
it
up
last
night
pours
a
nice
head
that
retains
itself
til
the
end
smells
of
citrus
fruit
chardonnay
oak
barrels
a
bit
on
the
sourbelgian
style
side
the
wild
yeast
is
something
im
still
trying
to
grasp
a
bit
acidic
will
get
used
to
it
and
try
the
style
again
this
beer
assaults
the
tastebuds
at
first
and
then
becomes
more
and
more
enjoyable
as
your
tastbuds
adjust
better
than
average
drinkability
drink
one
or
two
mix
and
match
with
other
gueuze
examples
could
be
much
more
drinkable
but
its
definitely
not
a
heartburn
beer
its
a
smooth
tartness
sour
and
acidic
without
being
vinegary
in
the
future
ill
probably
pass
though
six
dollars
for
12
oz
bottle
is
steep
when
i
can
find
a
better
gueuze
in
the
same
price
range
ive
never
really
liked
this
style
of
beer
but
i
like
to
judge
beers
based
on
their
style
not
against
all
other
beers
in
existence
for
the
style
this
is
a
decent
gueze
worthy
a
try
but
far
from
the
best
i
believe
this
one
was
past
its
prime
but
it
was
enjoyable
i
will
try
other
gueuzes
before
returning
to
this
one
but
i
hope
to
return
a
complex
and
multidimensional
geuze
that
is
quite
enjoyable
considerably
milder
and
less
offensive
than
most
geuze
lots
of
bubbles
more
so
than
is
typical
typical
feet
and
battery
acid
smell
and
taste
only
lighter
lots
of
rotten
lemons
i
like
it
a
lot
but
it
is
just
way
more
mellow
than
most
lots
of
yeast
creates
a
particulate
feel
light
dirty
yellow
body
spritzy
very
clean
all
the
elements
are
there
they
are
just
smaller
than
normal
this
would
be
a
good
starting
geuze
very
crispy
and
refreshing
tart
and
clean
the
sourness
is
not
overbearing
even
for
those
not
yet
accustomed
to
the
style
easy
drinking
i
enjoyed
this
ale
very
much
these
guys
have
found
a
nice
balance
between
the
challanging
sourbarnyardearth
flavors
and
something
fun
and
simple
thats
easy
to
enjoy
cheers
d
this
beer
and
style
are
not
going
to
be
for
everyone
of
the
few
lambic
gueuze
examples
ive
tried
this
is
a
very
good
one
strong
flavors
that
open
the
senses
very
good
smell
tatse
ill
enjoy
this
again
pale
hazy
gold
with
strong
bubbly
carbonation
helping
to
maintain
a
nice
head
aroma
of
tart
apple
and
vinegar
not
real
strong
in
potency
but
enough
to
give
you
an
idea
the
taste
has
a
medium
tartness
with
notes
of
sour
peach
and
apple
finish
is
rather
crisp
and
the
flavors
are
fleeting
light
body
strong
on
bubbles
very
tasty
only
an
average
amount
of
sourness
but
this
may
make
it
easier
to
drink
not
so
much
for
complexity
but
well
done
i
actually
think
i
like
this
better
than
the
mp
its
lower
alcohol
not
sure
i
really
beleive
the
8
on
the
other
but
it
is
a
really
good
drinker
on
a
lazy
day
the
drinkability
is
o
k
but
not
great
because
it
is
such
an
overwhelming
flavor
it
is
great
in
small
doses
drinkability
id
be
lying
if
i
said
i
didnt
find
the
sourness
in
this
beer
a
little
overpowering
so
for
me
the
drinkability
score
is
less
than
average
even
though
it
is
fairly
tasty
and
refreshing
i
can
only
handle
this
in
smaller
volumes
a
great
beer
to
pair
with
fruit
or
brie
or
both
though
id
say
serve
this
at
a
brunch
hell
it
would
probably
make
a
pretty
awesome
mimosa
emmenently
quaffable
and
a
bottle
i
would
never
ever
turn
down
opinion
this
is
an
excellent
beer
and
one
that
i
will
definitely
be
drinking
again
i
think
that
it
is
a
touch
mild
when
compared
to
some
other
gueuze
beers
but
it
is
still
excellent
i
am
a
bit
more
partial
to
the
more
assertive
beers
like
cantillon
or
girardin
but
this
is
an
excellent
brew
i
would
definitely
pick
one
of
these
up
again
if
given
the
opportunity
id
heard
a
lot
about
this
blend
of
old
and
new
unfruited
lambic
and
had
to
try
it
it
was
rather
tart
but
still
refreshing
it
has
a
slight
haze
and
straw
color
the
head
formed
large
and
settled
to
a
manageable
one
finger
width
in
a
couple
of
miuntes
it
was
highly
carbonated
with
a
grainy
acidic
somewhat
mellow
aroma
as
the
beer
warmed
the
tart
acidity
laid
down
a
little
bit
but
was
still
the
predominant
character
the
hops
do
not
make
much
of
an
appearance
with
this
beer
id
drink
it
again
but
would
probably
recommend
a
fruited
lambic
to
all
but
the
real
adventuresome
dont
get
me
wrong
i
like
havoc
especially
in
wild
beers
this
is
sure
drinkable
due
to
its
light
champagney
nature
and
lack
of
imposing
tartness
and
it
holds
up
as
a
nice
bubbly
crisp
beer
but
the
flavor
isnt
where
i
would
like
it
to
be
especially
from
a
master
blender
and
lambic
seller
ok
but
for
6
a
small
bottle
somewhat
of
a
letdown
geuze
boon
sits
in
the
glass
a
hazy
light
brown
the
aroma
hmm
your
typical
funkiness
and
cheese
the
flavor
profile
is
marked
by
a
mustiness
along
with
horse
and
those
other
barnyard
descriptors
i
know
boon
is
one
of
the
more
notable
producers
of
authentic
lambics
but
even
the
beer
snob
in
me
cant
force
an
endorsement
of
this
i
will
say
that
this
nothing
in
this
beer
is
offensive
and
its
just
interesting
enough
to
be
above
average
taste
has
a
similar
balance
a
touch
of
apple
sweetness
with
the
nice
champagnelike
feel
and
the
tartness
high
carbonation
but
with
a
refreshing
feel
balanced
and
drinkable
poured
an
orange
blossom
honey
color
with
a
solid
finger
of
very
fine
and
creamy
head
like
a
merangue
the
smell
was
of
a
pungent
hay
bale
bordering
on
a
bitter
honey
mustard
dipping
sauce
tasted
like
tart
and
sour
dry
minerally
green
unripe
apples
i
think
ill
have
to
review
this
one
again
as
i
get
more
into
the
style
mind
your
eyes
when
you
remove
the
crown
the
cork
exploded
into
the
ceiling
after
a
full
night
in
the
fridge
this
pours
a
perfect
golden
hazy
fizzy
bliss
like
you
expect
from
the
style
i
poured
this
into
a
goblet
because
i
wanted
it
to
warm
faster
and
i
love
the
smell
of
geuze
as
it
opens
the
head
is
big
and
rocky
and
sustains
well
geuze
smells
are
almost
more
impressive
as
the
flavors
and
boons
offers
some
nice
fruity
nose
with
sadly
minimal
funk
think
very
fresh
and
toned
down
tallegio
cheese
and
apples
the
mouthfeel
is
great
if
not
a
bit
too
carbonated
you
could
put
a
few
of
these
away
fast
very
little
sweetness
intense
sour
or
pungent
funk
like
you
might
expect
this
one
isnt
essential
in
any
way
imo
other
than
its
inobtrusive
drinkability
i
dont
want
my
geuze
to
wash
down
light
i
want
it
to
kick
my
ass
and
this
one
doesnt
its
good
balanced
and
pleasant
but
its
not
outstanding
the
only
unique
element
is
a
tad
more
hop
flavor
which
is
generally
minimal
in
these
dryhopped
beers
the
oud
beersel
girardin
and
drei
founteinen
offer
a
lot
more
flavor
and
complex
addicting
taste
i
respect
the
traditional
and
non
cloying
flavors
of
boons
kriek
but
this
geuze
is
just
too
simple
i
will
admit
i
drank
this
after
the
girardin
which
is
mindnumblingly
godly
this
is
a
good
summer
geuze
i
reckon
but
serve
it
warm
and
let
it
open
or
the
flavor
will
sneak
past
you
before
you
can
count
your
5
i
guess
this
brewer
is
also
responsible
for
the
recent
oud
beersel
products
which
are
the
marianne
to
boons
ginger
drinkability
im
liking
it
pretty
tasty
and
one
of
the
more
drinkable
ones
ive
come
accross
recommended
personally
i
strongly
prefer
the
flavored
lambics
like
cassis
framboise
or
peche
theres
so
little
sweetness
here
that
im
struggling
to
complete
the
tasting
produced
a
huge
meringuelike
3finger
head
which
lasted
quite
a
bit
of
time
below
was
a
cloudy
deep
orange
tinged
beer
with
streams
of
bubbles
emanating
from
the
bottom
aromas
of
banana
clove
plums
and
sweet
dark
cherries
were
detected
taste
was
sour
acidic
and
reminiscent
of
dry
champagne
an
aftertaste
of
dark
chocolate
was
noted
as
well
a
good
mouthfeel
but
a
bit
too
tingly
i
think
i
need
to
explore
this
style
of
beer
a
bit
more
before
i
make
a
solid
judgement
on
this
one
a
really
wonderful
gueuze
dry
as
a
bone
and
very
drinkable

closer
to
a

5
on
the
regular
beer
scale
rated
to
style
there
are
many
better
but
this
is
still
a
damn
good
gueuze
overall
an
excellent
gueuze
very
refreshing
and
very
drinkable
probably
not
to
everyones
taste
though
drinkability
and
overall
you
want
a
garbage
geueze
here
it
is
looks
great
smells
even
better
but
tastes
just
about
as
fake
as
a
spontaneously
fermented
beer
can
get
blah
as
my
girlfriend
put
it
fuck
this
i
agree
baby
pours
a
very
nice
slightly

color

a

to
go
thru
this
one
peppery
and
spicy
aroma
somewhat
earthy
and
dirt
like
sour
and
very
dry
flavor
sort
of
black
pepper
like
hops
no
way
good
bodya
real
pucker
upper
a
good
beer
but
i
dont
see
being
able
to
consume
a
lot
of
this
nice
to
try
but
just
not
my
thing
this
beer
is
more
like
a
champagne
than
anything
but
whatever
it
is
good
it
pours
a
hazy
yellow
color
and
has
a
fat
white
head
and
violent
carbonation
it
has
a
very
intense
sour
aroma
and
a
wild
yeasty
aroma
that
are
nothing
short
of
spectacular
its
flavor
is
intensely
sour
and
has
a
grapechampagne
like
body
and
flavor
that
gives
way
to
an
intense
sour
finish
this
is
a
young
lambic
as
its
expiration
date
is
12202022
but
it
is
already
intense
in
its
flavor
profile
if
they
get
better
than
this
i
am
in
for
a
flavorful
experience
because
i
want
to
try
them
all
pours
with
a
fierce
bubbly
forming
a
huge
5
head
over
an
orangey
gold
color
shares
alot
of
the
characteristics
of
a
champagne
constant
bubbly
great
head
retention
gobs
and
gobs
of
lace
a
strong
musky
vinous
aroma
medium
bodied
dry
mouthfeel
and
despite
the
very
active
carbonation
it
is
very
gentle
on
the
tongue
mature
taste
to
start
a
bit
of
subdued
cereal
flavor
some
grapey
elements
then
a
notably
sour
puckering
finish
this
is
a
good
beer
for
when
you
just
want
a
beer
this
is
one
serious
ride
for
a
beer
crazy
i
dont
think
more
than
one
is
recommended
but
accompanied
with
sharp
cheese
this
would
rule
the
head
is
a
towering
crusty
white
meringue
that
builds
thick
foamy
walls
on
the
inside

when

mark
the
fizzy
middle
which
is
just
a
little
fishy
huge
bitterness
in
the
end
tangy

grapefruit
and
apples
this
is
a
good
sour
fruity
cheesy
beer
delicious
picked
up
at
jungle
jims
in
cincy
gueuze
seems
to
be
the
style
that
im
currently
most
interested
in
although
i
admit
that
cantillon
has
set
the
bar
a
little
high
for
comparisons
appearance
starts
off
well
enough
a
nice
cloudlike
head
atop
a
burnt
orange
body
aroma
is
obviously
tart
with
hints
of
cider
and
a
slight
funkiness
taste
is
more
of
the
same
however
the
funkiness
hides
in
the
finish
along
with
a
slight
metallic
twang
ill
revist
boon
in
the
near
future
hopefully
with
a
slightly
older
bottle
drinkability

this
was
a
good
offering
from
boon
although
a
bit
unbalanced
for
my
tastes
while
drinking
the
quality
is
evident
for
ones
liking
a
slightly
hazey
dark
orange
colored
ale
with
a
big
off
white
head
and
some
lace
the
aroma
is
sour
fruit
most
predominate
was
a
sour
apple
aroma
the
taste
is
very
sour
and
very
dry
kind
of
oaky
with
a
bitter
apple
peel
after
taste
i
could
not
determine
the
bottling
year
of
my
bottle
but
i
did
note
the
the
bottle
claims
6
5
abv
champagne
like
carbonation
in
this
cloudy
copper
colored
beer
a
sour
aroma
followed
by
sweaty
horse
blanket
not
as
intense
as
the
kriek
i
just
had
the
flavor
is
balanced
but
definitely
sour
there
is
some
sweetness
and
bitterness
holding
the
sourness
in
check
until
the
barnyard
flavor
sneaks
in
and
is
washed
away
by
the
very
acidic
finish
like
a
chewable
vitamin
c
tablet
there
is
some
body
here
but
the
mouthfeel
is
more
noticably
bubbly
almost
like
alka
seltzer
i
surprisingly
found
this
better
than
the
kriek
i
just
had
cost
5
99
but
it
was
well
worth
it
highly
recommended
12
oz
corked
and
caged
bottle
cork
popped
with
some
force
behind
it
pours
out
a
clear
deep
golden
pils
color
with
a
big
fluffy
light
beige
head
acidic
woody
barnyardy
smells
and
a
slight
bit
of
honeysweet
malts
come
through
in
the
nose
not
quite
as
tart
and
acidic
as
ive
experience
in
other
gueuzes
this
ones
actually
a
little
bit
sweet
but
it
does
have
a
nice
vinous
tartness
and
oakiness
more
towards
the
finish
kind
of
fruity
like
the
skins
of
a
bosq
pear
not
bad
at
all
especially
if
your
looking
for
a
gueuze
thats
not
going
to
turn
your
tongue
into
the
sahara
but
with
a
freshness
dating
of
2112022
im
sure
the
sweetness
would
be
cut
to
nil
by
that
time
and
ill
be
and
old
man
brisk
on
the
palete
immediately
acidic
very
dry
from
start
to

a
pleasant
undercurrent
of

hints
of
oak
lemon

with
a
quick
finish
that
invites
another

stunning
beer
is
good
happy
beering
tartness
dominates
both
the
aroma
and
flavor
of
this
beer
a
bit
lemony
in
flavor
with
a
champagne
like
flavor
and
body
theres
just
a
hint
of
malt
struggling
to
make
itself
noticed
throughout
the
sip
but
that
hint
does
a
lot
to
add
to
the
beers
depth
effervescent
in
the
mouth
with
a
very
dry
finish
drinkable
indeed
bottle
poured
a
light
yellow
colored
beer
with
a
huge
thick
head
that
had
super
strong
retention
aroma
was
sour
with
some
subtle
sweet
notes
taste
was
sour
to
begin
with
and
more
sweet
as
it
goes
through
my
palate
yeast
was
quite
subtle
and
body
quite
light
very
good
gueuze
maybe
not
as
complex
as
the
marriage
parfait
and
very
refreshing
overall
you
can
really
go
wrong
with
boon
products
overall
cantillion
gueuze
is
still
my
pick
for
an
endofthenight
nitecap
and
i
might
order
the
boon
again
but
not
if
cantillon
is
there
all
things
said
this
is
a
killer
lambic
i
like
it
almost
as
well
as
cantillon
all
the
complex
elements
of
a
lambic
are
there
but
take
a
backseat
to
the
lactic
sour
character
which
hits
big
the
second
you
taste
the
beer
stays
solid
through
the
midpalate
and
finally
slowly
evaporates
in
the
aftertaste
there
are
lambics
that
are
more
sour
and
just
a
bit
drier
but
few
come
together
like
boon
gueze
into
an
allaround
classic
lambic
it
feels
cleansing
in
the
mouth
until
the
sourness
really
hits
which
puckers
the
mouth
a
little
i
finished
the
355
ml
bottle
but
i
wasnt
ready
to
run
out
and
get
another
i
will
try
this
or
other
geuze
brews
again
though
this
beer
poured
a
light
gold
color
and
formed
nice
pillowy
white
head
that
left
circular
lace
when
it
finally
decided
to
die
down
a
heavy
amount
of
carbonation
is
present
a
heavy
aroma
cider
and
apples
dominates
a
slight
flavor
of
malt
with
an
overiding
character
of
apples
yeastbread
the
finish
of
course
is
quite
sour
and
astrigent
but
not
as
dry
as
a
couple
others
i
have
had
this
is
definetly
a
very
easy
drinking
and
enjoyable
lambic
this
was
my
first
sampling
of
the
style
and
if
this
is
an
acquired
taste
then
i
acquired
it
quickly
the
sweet
and
sour
parlay
with
a
nod
to
the
sour
lends
sensory
stimulation
to
a
unique
flavor
profile
the
manageable
alcohol
level
and
lipsmacking
tastiness
combine
to
make
the
next
one
a
nicely
anticipated
pleasure
this
may
not
be
the
style
id
choose
for
my
session
beers
but
it
will
indeed
one
day
soon
pass
these
lips
again
i
respect
this
beer
a
great
deal
i
respect
the
genre
of
geuze
lambics
in
general
the
bottle
spells
it
geuze
but
the
concept
is
quite
alien
to
my
tastes
and
im
very
hesitant
in
offering
praise
to
something
im
not
sure
i
fully
understand
i
was
not
overly
enthusiastic
about
this
unique
specialty
beer
but
by
the
time
i
finished
it
i
could
see
how
it
might
grow
on
you
over
time
wow
my
first
experience
with
gueuze
very
attractive
looking
beer
nice
head
nice
color
the
smell
was
fascinating
definately
reminded
me
of
a
barnyard
straw
dry
mold
etc
is
this
horsiness
also
get
a
bit
of
sour
fruit
and
oak
type
smell
but
dominated
by
the
horse
taste
was
very
very
dry
i
bet
the
final
gravity
isnt
above
1
005
probably
less
very
acidic
and
sour
but
with
a
pleasant
sweetlike
horseywoody
aftertaste
that
lingers
under
your
tongue
of
course
it
is
very
very
lightly
sweet
just
barely
perciptible
but
after
all
the
sourness
it
seems
as
if
whatever
sugar
is
in
there
is
going
to
be
noticeable
this
beer
is
really
complex
and
i
like
how
the
sourness
makes
the
tiny
bit
of
sweetness
stand
out
very
subtle
but
delightful
a
little
to
potent
to
have
more
than
one
unfortunately
even
this
one
is
starting
to
give
me
a
sour
stomach
but
i
have
a
weak
stomach
so
go
figure
after
removing
the
cage
a
quick
pull
and
the
cork
jumped
right
out
poured
a
clear
golden
straw
color
with
soda
like
carbonation
smell
was
grapefruity
tart
but
not
overly
sour
which
i
was
a
bit
surprised
at
initial
taste
was
very
light
and
effervescent
throughout
drinking
it
always
felt
too
light
kind
of
like
eating
a
whole
cup
of
the
foamy
top
on
a
macchiato
taste
was
lightly
sour
pleasant
but
not
as
upfront
as
other
guezes
an
excellent
traditional
gueuze
that
i
wouldnt
pass
up
but
if
given
the
choice
between
cantillon
drie
fonteinen
or
boon
this
would
have
to
be
my
last
choice
this
beer
comes
in
a
champange
styles
bottle
and
pours
a
large
white
head
a
long
lasting
head
the
taste
is
very
sour
and
tastes
of
sour
apples
it
smells
of
sour
apples
too
this
was
the
first
geuze
i
have
tried
i
was
sceptical
at
first
i
thought
it
was
to
sour
but
it
is
definitely
a
beer
style
i
will
try
again
this
rates
as
a
pretty
tart
flavored
lambic
though
ive
had
others
that
make
my
cheeks
pucker
a
little
more
flavor
is
reminiscent
of
a
very
sweet
white
wine
finishes
a
bit
dry
though
reading
the
other
reviews
it
is
much
less
dry
than
i
expected
this
is
pretty
decent
though
nothing
remotely
mindblowing
screw
that
bubbly
wine
stuff
boon
gueuze
pours
with
a
very
fizzy
head
the
color
is
golden
amber
with
a
slight
haze
the
bubbly
head
recedes
about
half
way
down
rather
quickly
then
stalls
for
a
time
the
head
eventually
deflates
to
a
nice
full
thin
lace
that
lasts
for
the
entire
glass
the
aroma
is
tart
and
rather
vinous
with
maybe
a
touch
of
tart
apple
fruitiness
the
flavor
also
is
at
once
very
tart
the
tartness
overwhelms
on
the
first
sip
and
is
almost
sour
although
not
quite
as
harsh
on
subsequent
sips
the
tartness
is
present
from
start
to
finish
there
is
a
very
slight
sweetness
in
the
start
but
it
doesnt
stand
out
for
very
long
beyond
the
start
the
sweetness
becomes
a
very
slight
underlying
hint
of
apple
fruitiness
an
oakywoody
nature
seems
to
sneak
out
somewhere
around
the
middle
along
with
some
slight
vinous
notes
there
is
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
that
is
much
like
champagne
the
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
and
is
fairly
dry
throughout
the
finish
has
a
bit
of
a
citric
lemony
note
i
had
this
gueuze
all
by
itself
with
nothing
to
accompany
it
so
the
tartsour
nature
of
it
was
a
bit
harsh
at
times
this
seems
like
a
beer
that
should
not
be
drunk
on
its
own
but
paired
with
food
so
its
drinkablility
is
hampered
a
bit
over
all
okay
but
hard
to
compare
to
others
since
the
only
other
gueuze
ive
had
is
lindemans
gueuze
which
is
quite
sweet
compared
to
boon
gueuze
when
poured
this
beer
had
a
large
sized
ivory
head
with
finesmall
sized
bubbles
that
mostly
dissipated
the
body
was
cloudy
with
carbonation
observed
and
the
hue
was
brown
the
nose
was
fruity
and
sweet
with
a
sweet
flavor
to
it
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
thin
watery
and
light
bodied
there
was
a
fair
amount
of
lacing
with
this
beer
medium
gold
color
large
head
aroma
is
sour
apples
and
a
touch
of
barnyard
a
medium
bodied
geuze
tart
and
sour
balanced
by
some
applish
sweetness
hints
of
wood
it
very
dry
the
dryness
sort
of
takes
over
every
other
aspect
of
this
beer
all
in
all
it
still
a
drinkable
geuze
mouthfeel
is
full
finish
is
dry
and
tart
aftertaste
is
bitter
and
tart
lightly
sour
aroma
with
a
bit
of
funkiness
to
it
does
not
taste
all
that
sour
one
of
the
more
mellow
sour
geuzes
does
not
have
the
fullness
and
balance
of
the
better
made
ones
hanssens
for
instance
though
still
quite
good
the
sourness
reminds
me
of
grapefruit
and
there
is
a
bit
of
fruitiness
in
the
beer
which
accentuates
this
perception
as
well
well
ive
met
my
match
ill
get
it
again
but
ill
have
to
pair
it
to
the
perfect
food
to
get
all
that
i
can
get
out
of
it
this
brew
pours
a
large
head
of
fine
to
medium
sized
white
bubbles
and
an
transparent
ligh
amber
brown
body
it
had
a
strong
citrousy
fruity
aroma
the
flavor
was
strong
and
bubbly
with
notes
of
citrus
it
has
a
very
tart
initial
mouthfeel
that
left
my
mouth
feeling
bubbly
there
was
a
slight
bite
in
the
finish
i
sampled
a
355ml
caged
cork
bottle
upon
removing
the
cage
the
cork
burst
sans
coaxing
almost
putting
a
hole
in
my
ceiling
regardless
this
traditional
gueuze
pours
a
beautiful
apricot
color
with
a
condensed
bubbly
head
excellent
retention
the
smell
is
quite
musty
funky
and
ones
tastebuds
get
more
than
a
hint
that
some
sour
acidity
is
on
its
way
never
fail
the
palate
is
bombarded
with
a
mildly
astringent
sour
flavor
with
a
good
bit
of
acidity
never
cloying
however
and
notes
of
granny
smith
apples
are
evident
along
with
a
mildly
spicy
finish
very
enjoyable
the
mouthfeel
is
very
lively
spritzy
and
carbonted
not
dissimilar
to
champagne
an
easily
drinkable
beverage
for
sure
but
not
necessarily
as
solid
as
cantillons
wonderful
offering
even
though
this
is
an
excellent
gueuze
and
is
better
suited
for
a
seasoned
palate
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
head
of
white
and
orange
body
unsettling
aroma
of
forgotten
fruit
left
in
a
lunch
bag
for
three
days
too
long
sour
and
earthy
like
overripe
french
cheese
zingzap
pow
on
the
palate
i
poured
this
for
four
of
my
friends
and
we
all
poured
it
out
i
cannot
see
the
hops
unless
that
is
was
tastes
like
rotting
leather
or
what
i
imagine
that
might
taste
like
this
is
not
as
bad
as
i
make
it
sound
but
not
much
better
this
is
fabulously
interesting
but
anything
but
enjoyable
suprisingly
unbelievably
good
this
is
truely
a
unique
beer
now
trying
it
for
the
second
time
the
sheer
shock
value
of
the
first
time
around
is
no
longer
there
but
now
i
am
barely
beginning
to
appreciate
the
complexity
contained
in
this
brewing
masterpiece
while
the
appearance
is
somewhat
shifty
reminding
myself
of
a
cloudy
homebrew
disaster
the
sheer
drinkability
is
absolutely
phenomonal
this
one
is
a
very
nice
deep
orange
color
with
a
tiny
bubblly
head
it
has
a
very
tradtional
lambic
aroma
with
lemons
and
toasted
malt
it
is
silky
on
the
tongue
with
tart
flavors
all
around
malt
in
the
middle
and
finishes
dry
and
sour
it
has
a
solid
but
light
body
thats
very
refreshing
with
light
woody
notes
highly
recomended
for
the
lambic
explorer
good
foam
for
a
geuze
high
and
compact
colourbright
hazy
golden
pungent
smell
with
leather
and
unripe
citrus
fruits
at
the
taste
it
is
rough
at
the
first
sip
but
then
it
becomes
more
encouragng
and
sweet
with
sourness
more
evident
in
the
aftertaste
tobacco
old
hops
persistent
aftertaste
the
beer
pours
a
translucent
deep
golden
amber
color
the
head
mountainous
the
texture
spumescent
off
white
in
color
and
as
it
desiccates
the
lace
left
behind
a
nice
sealing
sheet
nose
is
tart
hints
of
pineapple
crisp
and
clean
a
nice
treat
for
the
senses
the
brew
starts
with
a
lemon
like
tartness
top
is
slim
in
its
feel
to
the
palate
the
finish
ferine
in
its
acidity
with
the
tartness
carrying
all
the
way
to
the
very
dry
aftertaste
i
just
never
really
know
what
to
think
of
gueuze
lambics
but
quite
drinkable
nonetheless
enjoy
color
a
hazy
orange
head
a
tad
offwhite
aroma
utterly
unique
and
not
for
the
uninitiated
you
have
to
be
ready
for
this
type
of
beer
for
its
unlike
anything
else
in
the
world
the
wild
yeast
the
spontaneous
fermentation
no
wonder
the
lambic
brewers
are
most
successful
when
they
introduce
fruits
to
this
incredibly
demanding
brew
citrusy
sour
dry
medicinal
herbal
even
a
little
vinegary
texture
is
full
salty
body
is
medium
finish
is
quite
lasting
definitely
takes
some
getting
used
to
but
a
solid
thirst
quenching
even
delectable
beer
drinkability
very
refreshing
like
a
cider
the
6
5
abv
is
masked
very
well
this
poured
with
a
towering
offwhite
head
over
hazy
gold
liquid
with
some
amber
hightlights
nose
is
intense
with
notes
of
yeast
sour
apples
taste
is
very
unique
almost
champagnelike
in
its
mouthfeel
and
flavors
with
dry
fruitiness
tartness
and
a
refreshing
sour
quality
that
makes
it
wonderful
to
quaff
finishes
bone
dry
and
very
quenching
a
beautiful
thing
i
am
a
gueuze
virgin
no
more
absolutely
my
favorite
style
opaque
mustard
brown
color
early
big
champagne
head
that
settles
down
quickly
sour
aromas
with
some
decided
skunkmusk
oil
smells
characteristic
sour
notes
with
elements
of
raisins
and
cinnamon
not
so
astringent
that
you
dont
notice
these
secondary
flavors
dries
to
a
white
winelike
finish
at
the
back
true
enough
to
style
my
rating
hinges
on
the
fact
that
its
not
as
flamboyant
in
profile
as
cantillon
nor
as
puckering
cloudy
golden
coloring
with
a
thick
white
head
that
hangs
in
there
smell
is
very
fruity
the
nose
definitely
indicates
the
tartness
of
the
brew
taste
is
quite
tart
with
characteristics
of
a
dry
white
wine
this
is
i
think
the
second
gueuze
ive
had
and
i
was
impressed
certainly
something
to
have
when
you
feel
like
having
something
different
a
slightly
sweeter
gueuze
but
still
dry
enough
refreshing
tart
qualties
obviously
not
as
good
as
their
mariage
parfait
gueuze
but
its
pretty
solid
this
will
appeal
to
a
wider
range
of
people
this
was
a
really
good
gueuze
had
it
in
brussels
at
beer
circus
with
a
plate
of
cheese
and
bread
sorry
brewguru
but
this
is
what
the
style
is
suppose
to
be
highly
carbonated
and
bracingly
sour
the
only
bad
thing
you
can
say
about
it
is
that
it
doesnt
have
quite
the
wild
complexity
of
a
cantillion
or
a
hansons
but
still
a
knockout
gueuze
not
one
of
the
hyped
gueuzes
but
it
hits
the
points
of
the
style
and
is
really
drinkable
i
guess
i
would
knock
the
boldness
and
complexity
which
are
lacking
but
def
worth
a
try
for
lambic
drinkers
and
its
usually
on
the
cheaper
side
beer
is
mediumlight
in
body
with
carbonation
of
medium
intensity
resulting
in
a
fairly
foamy
35
and
slightly
smooth
25
mouthfeel
closes
dry
with
moderate
stickiness
remaining
on
the
palate
and
lips
cheers
overall
needs
more
intensity
in
funk
sour
and
flavor
pours
a
somewhatdarkened
golden
color
with
a
good
white
head
and
just
a
bit
of
lacing
on
the
way
down
the
nose
has
some
restrained
funk
and
some
earthiness
acidity
is
lighttomoderate
a
bit
of
citrus
but
not
too
much
a
la
tilquin
or
cantillon
flavor
is
similar
body
is
light
and
carbonation
is
a
bit
low
not
enough
funk
or
acidity
its
a
bit
lacking
in
character
an
interesting
gueuze
to
try
but
not
among
the
best
o
a
very
drinkable
gueuze
perfect
for
a
noninitiate
for
instance
well
done
in
this
extent
but
lacks
a
bit
of
personality
the
beer
is
hazy
and
light
apricot
hued
hay
funk
citrus
oak
the
delectable
aroma
translates
to
the
flavor
a
really
tasty
beer
well
balanced
and
easy
to
drink
pleasant
tartness
and
a
really
fantastic
oak
character
relatively
high
carbonation
overall
really
solid
i
hope
to
have
this
again

factor
thought
not

some
of
the

a
damn
good
gueze
surprised
and
impressed
with
how
balanced
it
is
o
a
subdued
gueuze
but
quite
drinkable
despite
not
being
especially
complex
drinkability
and
overall
impression
this
is
a
really
enjoyable
beer
with
its
clean
refreshing
aromas
and
flavors
and
the
background
of
musty
funky
i
enjoyed
drinking
it
and
would
be
quite
happy
to
have
another
bottle
indeed
i
think
that
this
would
be
a
fine
gueuze
for
the
table
and
enjoyment
with
a
meal
and
good
friends
my
overall
impression
is
of
a
wellmade
enjoyable
beer
that
is
of
good
quality
but
which
may
not
be
the
best
example
of
its
style
to
show
off
the
style
in
a
tasting
or
competition
given
that
the
best
by
date
is
18
years
into
the
future
im
harboring
a
slight
guilty
feeling
that
i
may
have
just
had
this
beer
much
too
young
doesnt
live
up
to
the
aroma
unfortunately
beer
is
thin
and
heavily
carbonated
on
the
palate
there
is
almost
nothing
initially
except
for
some
carbonic
burning
and
then
a
lemony
tartness
followed
by
the
mild
acetic
and
lactic
ness
the
last
little
bit
is
some
oak
and
a
minor
funk
it
was
good
and
got
better
as
it
warmed
up
i
really
enjoyed
it
but
it
could
have
had
more
pronounced
flavors
given
the
awesomeness
of
the
aroma
very
glad
i
got
to
try
this
beer
dseems
a
slightly
oxidized
and
the
flavor
profile
doesnt
seem
all
there
the
funk
was
present
but
the
balance
was
lacking
and
it
was
so
dry
and
hay
like
d
easy
drinking
and
fairly
refreshing
not
as
complex
as
the
best
representatives
of
the
style
but
by
no
means
would
i
hesitate
to
try
again
perfect
golden
hue
with
a
fluffy
white
head
i
can
tell
this
has
high
carbonation
aroma
is
bretty
and
lactic
a
little
too
straightforward
for
a
geuze
taste
is
light
with
a
mild
acidity
but
holds
a
heavy
brett
flavor
this
geuze
is
very
carbonated
which
makes
it
quite
refreshing
and
drinkable
this
may
hinder
its
flavor
a
bit
as
it
tastes
somewhat
one
dimensional
for
the
style
drinkability
is
ok
but
its
not
really
my
taste
the
soapiness
really
is
what
detracts
although
i
do
love
the
smell
d
a
very
nice
example
of
the
style
this
is
a
solid
example
of
the
style
it
definitely
could
use
more
brettanomyces
other
wild
character
and
it
needs
more
carbonation
but
it
is
quite
an
enjoyable
brew
overall
a
decent
example
of
the
style
nothing
special
here
though
moving
on
to
the
next
gueuze
in
the
end
good
drinkability
not
bad
for
a
sweet
gueuze
not
bad
at
all
overall
this
was
a
great
collaboration
between
eight
lambic
makers
in
belgium
exceeded
my
expectations
will
probably
get
better
and
better
with
age
my
bottle
had
a
best
by
date
of
2026
so
eleven
more
years
will
probably
turn
this
into
a
whale
for
a
true
sour
beer
lover
very
nice
geuze
with
a
heavy
influence
of
oak
fun
to
see
all
the
breweries
blended
together
expensive
bottle
though
the
nose
is
funky
a
little
cheese
sour

pulp
citrus
and
lemon
the
flavor
follows
the
nose
more
lemon
citrus
goat
cheese
floral
hops
it
is
very

lots
of

bitter
the
finish
is
very
active
poprocks
down
your
throat
very
good
beer
all
those
different
inputs
as
originally
opined
must
have
some
kind
of
middling
blending
and
in
the
end
neutering
effect
a
concept
which
is
evidently
on
full
display
here
distinctly
drinkable
and
approachable
for
the
style
mere
price
taggery
aside
this
gueze
sic
tour
is
exactly
that
an
introduction
to
the
whole
shebang
all
at
once
in
a
mildly
dumbeddown
touristy
incarnation
doesnt
mean
it
doesnt
taste
good
imho
a
great
gueuze
that
may
not
be
better
than
some
of
its
individual
components
yet
it
surely
delivers
on
many
of
the
facets
you
expect
from
the
best
examples
of
the
style
super
funky
bright
and
a
good
level
of
complexity
maybe
a
bit
too
aggressive
with
the
lemon
on
the
palate
very
nice
nonetheless
o
perfect
drinkability
perfect
lambic
overall
a
really
nice
gueuze
nothing
to
go
crazy
over
trying
to
obtain
but
definitely
worth
a
try
if
you
can
get
it
relatively
easily
overall
this
is
a
solid
gueuze
that
perhaps
doesnt
get
enough
credit
what
was
surprising
actually
was
that
all
the
vintages
were
relatively
similar
the
09
was
perhaps
the
best
but
theres
no
reason
to
believe
that
the
11
and
13
wont
be
there
in
time
very
consistent
glad
to
have
been
able
to
try
this
set
at
once
cheers
gents
no
problems
taking
down
the
big
bottle
solo
and
thats
not
common
for
me
among
sours
i
paid
the
same
price
for
at
so
all
things
considered
i
doubt
id
stock
up
if
i
had
the
chance
but
im
happy
to
have
tried
it
full

with
soft

that
lingers
over
the
barnyard

countered
by

that
makes
me
drool
for

drink

the

and

very

quality

gets
better
and
more

nothing
here
really

at
me
at

d

all
around
a

but
such
is
the

definitely
worth

and
a
not
a
bad

to
stock
up
on
either
o
a
very
nice

not
too
unique

very
tasty

refreshing
overall
i
enjoyed
this
gueuze
but
it
by
no

is
the
best
i
have
ever
had
i
am
not
sure
of
the
price
but
i
cant
imagine
it
was
cheap
for
a
style
i
dont
gravitate
to
or
often
seek
out
i
can
say
that
there
are
better
examples
which
i
hope
to
eventually
have
again
but
this
is
not
one
of
them
flamboyant
and
complex
with
the
odd
harsh

just
a
simple
nature
its
bright
its
jumpy
its

sharp
the
taste
is
very
acidic
at
first
but
gets
tropical
and
has
light
and
mellow
lemond
rind
in
the
background
i
get
a
mild
wood
tinge
in
the
taste
which
adds
to
the
complexity
of
flavor
the
wild
yeast
does
contribute
significantly
with
light
sour
elements
and
more
of
a
dry
herbal
element
throughout
overall
i
liked
this
a
huge
gueuze
with
tons
of
complexity
and
has
a
very
drying
finish
with
plenty
of
funky
character
the
palate
opens
with
a
pretty
huge
sourness
very
grapefruitlike
with
some
lime
character
as
well
there
is
also
a
moderate
amount
of
tannins
here
along
a
rather
strong
lactic
note
there
is
also
flavor
reminiscent
of
acetic
acidacetone
but
not
quite
the
upshot
is
that
the
sourness
is
harsh
and
lacks
the
finesse
of
some
of
the
better
gueuzes
out
there
not
as
musty
as
the
nose
would
suggest
the
funk
is
mostly
a
blend
of
hay
and
some
mushrooms
the
wheaty
cereal
sweetness
does
appear
in
the
midpalate
strongly
reminding
me
of
the
lindemans
cuvee
rene
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
confusing
its
mildly
slimy
like
a
bakers
egg
wash
but
highly
carbonated
sweet
yet
dry
and
also
a
little
alcoholic
and
a
little
too
tannic
for
my
palate
the
tannins
enhance
the
sourness
and
the
harsh
qualities
of
this
gueuze
the
high
abv
makes
this
a
little
hard
to
drink
as
well
not
bad
but
not
going
out
of
your
way
to
try
imo
and
drinking
an
entire
bottle
only
emphasizes
its
flaws
not
a
bad
gueuze
but
not
worth
the
price
quite
amazing
every
well
balanced
if
you
see
it
get
it
lots
of
fun
to
fun
bottle
pours
a
cloudy
apricot
color
with
a
nice
fluffy
white
dense
head
nice
lace
peachy
fruity
aroma
slightly
white
wine
like
starts
with
a
nive
sourness
that
then
builds
to
a
slight
bitterness
note
light
mouthfeel
overall
i
was
surprised
a
little
at
this
one
on
one
hand
it
is
pretty
tasty
and
easy
drinking
but
on
the
other
i
find
it
lacks
a
certain
depth
seen
in
other
lambic
i
like
it
but
wish
it
hand
just
a
little
more
something
to
it
tastes
good
but
again
fairly
simple
lemon
tannic
oak
slight
grassiness
bit
of
maltiness
too
though
its
largely
dry
pretty
spritzy
mouthfeel
light
mildly
tannic
finish
certainly
enjoyable
but
it
didnt
leave
a
strong
impression
youd
expect
more
depth
from
a
lambic
blended
from
so
many
different
sources
an
incredible
blend
im
so
glad
i
got
to
try
this
had
this
side
by
side
with
the
cantillon
classic
gueuze
and
id
have
to
say
that
i
prefer
this
to
the
fresh
gueuze
funkier
and
with
a
more
complex
flavor
profile
feel
ties
everything
together
nicely
too
would
love
a
bottle
of
this
to
age
for
a
couple
years
o
definitely
not
as
sour
as
the
2009
but
has
more
balance
and
will
be
a
better
candidate
for
aging
it
seems
like
armand
played
a
big
part
in
this
blend
because
it
was
very
similar
to
the
2010
df
geuze
we
opened
next
to
it
overall
very
nice
refreshing
geuze
will
develop
into
an
even
better
one
over
time
for
sure
very
refreshing
quite
drinkable
o
a
decent
gueuze
but
not
really
amazing
especially
for
the
pricedifficulty
of
acquisition
shared
this
one
with
the
nc
guys
during
the
we
want
the
funk
tasting
graciously
hosted
by
beermex2
big
thanks
goes
out
to
cwguy5
for
picking
this
one
up
for
me
while
he
was
in
belgium
2009
vintage
bottle
11382
served
from
bottle
into
a
mikkeller
flute
poured
a
golden
yellow
orange
with
a
half
finger
white
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
slowly
maintained
decent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sour
funk
tart
wood
and
slight
must
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
funk
sour
tart
fruit
and
wood
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
high
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
great
beer
it
was
a
really
big
hit
at
the
tasting
and
was
a
few
peoples
surprise
of
the
night
considering
the
company
of
beers
present
this
was
saying
something
both
the
flavor
and
aroma
were
screaming
with
notes
that
were
quite
appealing
and
pleasing
to
every
sense
that
could
pick
them
my
only
gripe
would
be
that
it
wasnt
the
prettiest
beer
ive
ever
seen
for
the
style
but
what
can
you
do
a
definite
must
try
for
anyone
out
there
if
you
have
not
so
good
i
am
going
to
be
looking
for
a
few
more
bottles
of
this
along
with
the
2011
to
put
in
my
cellar
for
awhile
overall
while
not
my
favorite
sour
i
have
ever
had
it
is
up
there
overall
a
nice
gueuze
that
surprised
me
it
was
pretty
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
id
recommend
this
one
750ml
bottle
thanks
to
grownfool
more
orange
than
yellow
with
a
good
foamy
head
smell
was
slightly
sour
dusty
citrus
good
the
taste
was
also
very
good
but
did
not
have
a
lot
of
horseblanket
or
barnyard
mostly
sour
citrus
with
a
slight
bit
of
phenol
and
rubber
on
the
backend
this
was
so
damn
easy
to
drink
quite
good
i
had
read
that
this
gueuze
was
not
so
great
but
i
disagree
this
was
a
very
good
gueuze
d
we
crushed
the
750ml
bottle
quite
easily
it
gets
extremely
dry
and
tannic
but
otherwise
its
quite
easy
drinking
i
might
need
to
get
another
one
of
these
for
the
cellar
as
i
can
see
it
holding
up
for
the
listed
20
years
i
was
excited
for
this
one
and
it
didnt
let
me
down
as
other
reviewers
have
noted
age
helps
this
round
out
overall
horals
proves
that
americans
arent
the
only
ones
who
can
make
a
lackluster
collaboration
beer
nothing
particularly
spectacular
about
this
gueuze
and
the
overcarbonation
is
horrendous
the
top
lambic
makers
of
belgium
put
their
heads
together
and
came
up
with
this
pours
a
moderate
goldenyellow
color
with
some
visible
carbonation
pretty
good
white
head
with
a
touch
of
lacing
the
nose
is
mega
funky
with
a
really
nice
barnyard
presence
and
a
bit
of
hay
really
strong
in
everything
mild
diaper
and
rubber
in
the
background
in
a
good
way
the
flavor
continues
along
the
same
route
with
quite
a
bit
of
complex
funk
light
to
medium
body
with
a
very
dry
finish
quite
a
good
brew
thanks
again
matt
d
a
nice
tart
gueuze
i
liked
the
smell
a
lot
would
like
to
have
again
it
lives
up
to
the
aroma
beer
is
bright
and
light
on
the
palate
the
sourness
hits
you
almost
immediately
and
carries
through
to
the
tart
finish
of
the
beer
oh
so
wonderful
the
finish
isnt
too
dry
but
it
is
dry
would
i
drink
it
again
ummmm
yeah
d
not
a
bad
sour
but
not
earth
shattering
d
a
fine
example
of
a
gueuze
i
look
forward
to
acquiring
some
of
this
delicious
beer
for
the
cellar
d
a
real
sipper
for
me
but
this
was
a
great
beer
id
love
to
drink
regularly
this
is
really
good
and
worth
trying
a
pretty
solid
gueuze
blend
not
better
than
all
its
components
but
maybe
about
the
average
of
them
cheers
big
thanks
to
dave
for
sharing
much
more
cohesive
with
more
depth
it
tasted
like
cantillon
or
drie
fonteinen
oude
gueuze
bright
citrus
up
front
sour
but
well
balanced
pleasant
dry
woodiness
on
the
back
end
great
stuff
light
straw
colored
clear
body
good
carbonation
small
amount
of
quickly
dissipating
head
not
much
lacing
nose
is
pretty
funky
with
a
bit
of
stone
fruit
a
bit
acidic
complex
and
nicely
balanced
no
noticeable
hops
the
taste
is
insanely
complex
due
to
the
mega
blending
i
had
a
hard
time
picking
the
different
components
but
overall
some
leather
a
bit
of
horseblanket
face
puckering
sourness
a
bit
of
tartness
good
dose
of
salty
goodness
and
a
lot
of
wooden
character
from
the
aging
vessel
no
hops
to
speak
of
fairly
full
mouthfeel
for
style
real
good
effervescence
real
tasty
though
i
wonder
if
this
mad
experiment
would
taste
completely
different
the
next
time
overall
great
brew
and
a
pleasure
to
have
sampled
d
a
nice
gueuze
my
only
real
gripe
is
the
price
to
quality
ratio
the
regular
offerings
from
cantillon
girardin
and
drie
fonteinen
are
superior
in
nearly
every
facet
flavor
is
bretty
up
front
and
has
an
oaky
vanilla
sweetness
building
up
to
a
lactic
sour
aftertaste
not
completely
dry
i
can
see
the
brett
developing
this
beer
into
something
really
great
in
a
couple
of
years
the
taste
is
not
as
complex
as
the
aroma
yet
but
the
carbonation
is
lively
on
your
tongue
carbonation
might
be
getting
in
the
way
of
this
one
drinkability
while
not
outstanding
this
is
very
very
good
and
would
pair
well
with
food
great
blend
drinkability
going
down
fairly
easily
this
one
isnt
bad
by
any
means
but
it
needs
more
time
to
develop
for
sure
an
extraordinary
bottle
shared
by
emaineiacman
at
smbdc
meetup
in
may
brought
back
from
belgium
one
of
the
most
exquisite
unusual
blends
of
8
of
belgiums
best
lambic
brewers
dry
woody
great
aroma
of
mustiness
deep
orangey
color
longlasting
tart
finish
respectable
head
has
been
on
my
lifelist
for
awhile
and
can
say
it
is
very
much
worth
the
effort
to
procure
if
gueuze
is
your
passion
stone
makes
frequent
references
to
fizzy
yellow
beer
and
this
one
fits
the
bill
and
at
12
50
it
doesnt
even
have
the
benefit
of
being
cheap
bottle
poured
a
slightly
hazy
golden
color
gueuze
with
a
huge
foamy
head
with
great
retention
and
some
very
good
lacing
aroma
consists
of
light
acidity
with
some
oak
and
lots
of
tart
notes
taste
is
not
as
complex
as
i
would
have
hoped
but
some
very
nice
notes
of
oak
with
some
well
balance
acidity
and
sourness
makes
this
a
very
refreshing
drink
i
thought
it
lack
some
of
the
green
apple
notes
and
barnyard
aroma
of
gueuze
i
will
not
necessarily
seek
this
one
out
again
but
very
enjoyable
nonetheless
definitely
liking
this
gueuze
got
this
one
for
free
in
a
lif
which
makes
it
even
better
d
good
would
guess
this
one
would
age
gracefully
really
stinky
sour
cheese
scent
incredibly
funky
with
some
unbelievable
tart
lemon
there
is
an
incredible
cherry
scent
that
i
have
been
picking
up
a
lot
lately
in
some
of
the
better
wild
yeast
fermented
beers
i
have
had
i
couldnt
keep
my
nose
out
of
the
glass
the
taste
mirrors
the
scent
perfectly
and
is
incredibly
tart
this
really
blended
together
well
the
mouthfeel
is
highly
carbonated
but
a
little
bit
too
sharp
which
works
against
the
mouthfeel
slightly
all
in
all
an
excellent
offering
i
am
so
glad
that
my
bottle
has
been
cleaned
of
all
the
diacetyl
that
has
been
troubling
some
peoples
bottles
pediococcus
is
a
prodigious
diacetyl
producer
and
lambics
definitely
need
time
to
reduce
it
back
out
i
am
so
glad
that
this
turned
out
to
be
quite
tasty
man
this
is
quite
good
about
as
tart
sour
as
i
could
want
with
just
enough
funkiness
to
keep
things
interesting
this
is
a
fantastic
example
of
a
gueuze
at
least
this
particular
bottle
is
if
you
are
too
worried
just
hold
on
to
these
for
a
6
months
or
so
perhaps
the
international
shipping
helped
my
bottles
o
the
earthyheavy
flavor
profile
on
this
continues
to
be
unique
among
the
many
gueuzes
ive
tried
that
said
i
feel
like
ive
only
tried
relatively
recent
bottlings
of
this
though
this
one
was
bottled
in
2013
still
one
of
my
favorites
if
not
the
favorite

funky

goldenrod
and
wet

with

whispy
white
foam
cap
that
fairly
rapidly
dissipates
but
leave
thin
lace
a
marvelously
fine
carbonation
supports
dry
crisp
lemony
citrusy
tart
flavors
with
a
slight
bitterness
on
the
end
incredible
creamy
texture
light
body
a
super
refreshing
beer
leathery
musty
funk
with
a
hint
of
cheese
apple
hay
apricot
strawberry
white
pepper
muscat
grapes
plenty
of
vanilla
oak
to
balance
out
tartness
not
as
citric
and
sharp
as
a
cantillon
but
plenty
of
complexity
long
semidry
finish
and
enough
abv
to
warm
up
after
a
bit
nice
and
different
i
need
to
lay
one
down
for
at
least
a
few
years
i
love
a
gueze

some
funkiness

with

this
one
is
a
winner
o

very

awesome

i
get
a
nice
earthy

and
very
light
funky

type
flavor
in
the
back
keeping
things
interesting
this
is
a
great
beer
great
shelf
gueuze
a
bit
sweeter
and
dryer
than
i
prefer
and
the
higher
abv
provides
a
little
heat
on
the
aftertaste
however
great
balance
of
lemon
funk
slight
vinegar
earth
apple
pear
and
white
wine
will
be
buying
this
again
best
sour
ever
i
cant
believe
its
not
butter
pours
hazy
yellow
orange
with
a
bit
of
fizzy
head
smells
pretty
musty
and
cheesy
lots
of
acid
underneath
lemon
pulp
and
white
wine
taste
is
similar
cheese
and
must
that
turns
into
bright
lemon
and
white
wine
flavors
a
bit
more
on
the
mineral
end
a
little
bit
of
citrus
sweetness
to
balance
things
not
very
effervescent
but
smooth
and
very
enjoyable
nice
and
warming
due
to
high
abv
which
im
enjoying
much
more
than
i
thought
i
would
im
gonna
go
out
and
get
the
kriek
mariage
parfait
tomorrow
im
pretty
much
sold
on
boon
excellent
beer
this
is
an
excellent
gueuze
and
far
superior
to
boons
other
offerings
in
my
limited
experience
the
mariage
parfait
series
has
not
yet
disappointed
me
o
im
not
a
wine
drinker
so
maybe
i
cant
appreciate
this
style
its
just
over
carbonated
vinegary
sourness
it
is
refreshing
but
i
do
not
look
for
these
drinkable
and
complex
but
the
higher
gravity
makes
it
a
little
less
quaffable
not
my
goto
lambic
producer
but
still
very
nice
o
you
can
see
why
they
call
it
mariage
parfait
this
beer
is
an
amazingly
balanced
geuze
very
approachable
because
of
how
nicely
balanced
it
is
but
also
still
amazing
and
delicious
for
people
who
love
sour
bombs
or
are
more
experienced
with
geuzes
id
already
given
this
beer
a
glowing
review
but
after
trying
several
other
gueuzes
including
tilquin
cuvee
renee
and
oude
beersel
this
one
stands
out
as
the
best
to
me
id
imagine
its
age
has
something
to
do
with
it
but
still
wow
im
definitely
going
back
to
the
store
and
buying
them
out
of
375s
and
750s
in
preparation
of
my
perfect
marriage
o
as
im
learning
more
about
sours
im
really
starting
to
enjoy
them
this
is
an
exceptional
beer
that
is
very
refreshing
o
a
very
good
gueuze
especially
for
the
price
89375ml
here
and
availability
im
curious
to
see
how
this
one
ages
and
i
expect
it
to
do
very
well
its
considerably
better
and
more
complex
than
the
normal
gueuze
but
im
not
sure
thats
its
almost
twice
as
good
cloudy
orange
gold
pour
with
a
onefinger
white
head
big
sour
fruit
aroma
delicious
mild
sour
lemon
taste
upfront
backed
with
a
slight
fruity
sweetness
also
has
a
very
nice
oak
character
and
light
spice
flavor
in
the
medium
body
really
well
done
beer
that
isnt
overly
sour
or
tart
and
drinks
very
easy
for
the
body
and
slightly
high
abv
o
complex
tart
and
a
nice
funky
and
oak
undertone
at
a
reasonable
price
this
was
a
nice
geuze
id
pick
this
up
again
if
i
see
it
this
beer
is
intense
the
coming
together
of
powerful
earth
and
a
bright
bit
of
uplifted
sweetness
the
shyness
of
the
musty
earth
after
it
rains
and
the
greeness
that
lies
in
wait
for
when
the
sun
comes
to
shine
again
the
fruit
is
the
culmination
of
this
beer
and
is
taken
whole
in
its
every
aspect
from
sweet
peel
to
the
tartness
of
its
flesh
right
through
to
its
final
incarnation
sour
and
like
vinegar
in
decay
this
beer
is
truly
a
perfect
wedding
of
elements
edit2010
date
overall
this
a
delicious
and
well
made
geuze
while
its
not
as
refined
as
the
best
in
class
its
interesting
fairly
well
balanced
and
very
drinkable
its
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
or
those
opposed
to
the
funk
its
also
available
on
the
shelf
once
in
a
while
which
is
a
big
plus
the
taste
is
great
very
tangy
with
lemony
and
light
sweet
flavor
with
a
subtle
funkiness
and
gentle
alcohol
considering
it
is
8
it
is
pretty
faint
with
slight
woody
accent
and
mild
tannin
with
more
lemony
juicy
taste
like
sparkling
sour
lemonade
with
a
nice
dry
alcohol
augmented
finish
with
light
lactic
acid
continuing
on
after
the
dry
tangy
finish
overall
a
wonderful
gueuze
with
a
little
more
sourness
than
most
and
alcohol
yet
that
is
not
apparent
in
the
taste
i
really
loved
having
this
on
the
last
day
of
our
anniversary
trip
to
belgium
a
nice
affordable
readily
available
gueze
definitely
the
best
boon
geuze
ive
had
o
not
my
goto
style
by
any
means
but
this
was
a
tasty
brew
to
mix
things
up
a
different
rake
on
the
style
bright
fruits
mainly
citrus
really
lightens
things
up
not
quite
sour
but
plenty
of
tartness
to
combat
the
sweet
funk
is
minimal
but
the
odd
sesame
seed
spice
really
throws
a
twist
on
things
not
sure
if
its
the
combination
of
yeast
and
the
8
abv
or
if
i
cant
nail
down
an
ingrediant
i
enjoyed
exploring
this
beer
tastes
much
like
the
smell
rich
tart
acidic
flavor
you
should
not
drink
this
if
you
dont
like
sour
beers
if
you
do
this
should
but
really
high
on
your
list
of
must
grabs
well
carbonated
light
body
definitely
very
tart
its
great
if
you
love
sours
like
i
do
see
gueuze
can
still
be
good
without
being
rar

with
a

and

the
taste
was
similar

this
was
a
smooth
drinker
mellow
and
lightly
sour
with
a
medium
body
and
moderate
carbonation
very
good
overall
i
ended
up
picking
up
a
bottle
for
myself
at
the
shop
maybe
ill
see
what
a
few
more
years
does
to
it
overall
this
is
one
of
those
instances
where
reviewing
the
beer
almost
took
the
fun
out
of
drinking
it
such
a
cohesive
and
harmonious
product
that
you
just
kinda
want
to
throw
it
back
without
thinking
about
it
which
would
be
very
easy
to
do
fans
of
the
funk
may
be
rather
disappointed
as
this
is
exceptionally
bright
and
clean
the
floral
and
citrus
dimensions
are
almost
on
par
with
any
us
ipa
out
there
this
is
like
the
greatest
glass
of
lemonade
ever
o
an
excellent
well
made
and
flavorful
beer
definitely
drinkable
a
classic
wonderfully
balanced
a
great
intro
to
the
style
burnt
orange
hues
with
a
slight
white
head
cloudy
very
nice
nose
of
wildflowers
cheese
wood
sour
lemon
apples
and
leaves
nice
blend
of
fruit
and
funk
quite
pronounced
tartness
yet
not
exceedingly
sharp
as
to
offend
the
palate
delicious
and
quite
pleasing
goes
well
with
an
earthy
brie
cheese
very
enjoyable
geuze
balanced
and
just
sour
enough
notes
bottled
2009
this
is
a
beer
for
sitting
back
after
a
long
drive
on
a
warm
sunny
day
let
the
quiet
settle
in
and
listen
to
gentle
breezes
while
birds
chirp
in
the
trees
o
been
drinking
a
lot
of
sours
recently
and
this
does
not
hold
its
own
in
category
zero
pucker
o
i
enjoyed
this
one
but
it
wasnt
worth
what
i
had
to
pay
for
it
i
could
have
gotten
a
tilquin
for
a
few
dollars
cheaper
and
i
would
have
been
just
as
happy
if
not
happier
i
wouldnt
turn
down
another
but
i
doubt
i
would
buy
any
more
unless
the
price
is
right
a
rough
aggresive
beer
not
exactly
for
beginners
in
its
style
but
a
classic
for
pros
overall
this
reminds
me
of
a
lightly
tart
saison
i
scaled
the
taste
down
though
its
not
because
i
didnt
like
it
its
because
it
doesnt
remind
me
of
a
geuze
solid
and
refreshing
never
the
less
glowing
orangeamber
color
with
a
fleeting
head
of
crackling
foam
smells
of
dusty
green
apple
lime
and
lemon
damp
and
musty
with
some
mineral
notes
and
a
hit
of
woody
spice
big
funky
tart
flavor
right
away
its
apparent
that
this
is
stronger
than
your
average
gueuze
lemon
and
lime
acetic
dryness
earth
peppercorn
and
plenty
of
wood
a
bit
more
sweetness
than
others
within
the
style
that
ive
tried
but
also
perhaps
more
straightup
sourness
medium
bodied
tart
and
puckering
next
time
i
come
across
one
of
these
ill
grab
another
so
i
can
put
one
away
for
a
few
more
years
to
see
what
happens
dirty
gold
amber
in
color
with
a
modest
white
head
aroma
is
bright
fruity
woody
and
pleasantly
stinky
apples
cranberries
pear
melon
perhaps
very
clean
and
a
little
apple
pie
taste
is
sharply
sour
and
tangy
with
fruit
leaves
and
earthiness
very
refreshing
fermented
apples
with
grapefruit
rind
very
drying
on
the
palate
and
mouthwatering
with
its
tartness
implosive
mouthfeel
and
chalky
dryness
warming
somewhat
as
well
after
the
finish
2008
vintage
poured
in
december
2012
pours
cloudy
gold
color
with
the
perfectly
sized
head
that
recedes
moderately
fast
pears
apples
alcohol
lemon
zest
yeast
funk
on
the
aroma
bit
of
tart
smell
flavor
is
like
biting
into
a
fresh
green
apple
with
some
extra
lemon
tartness
somewhat
effervescent
with
a
dry
finish
but
wish
the
fruit
flavor
followed
it
down
the
throat
a
bit
dryness
takes
over
on
the
back
end
light
to
medium
mouthfeel
my
first
lambic
so
ill
have
to
venture
out
a
bit
from
here
solid
brew
and
a
nicr
change
up
good
sour
try
it
if
you
get
a
chance
would
drink
again
overall
nothing
offensive
going
on
here
just
doesnt
deliver
for
me
drops
off
in
the
back
with
too
much
malt
a
good
beginner
gueuze
710
sourness
very
nice
geuze
has
nice
citrus
sour
and
slight
dark
fruit
notes
o
i
usually
prefer
the
funkier
version
of
this
style
but
this
hits
a
lot
of
great
complex
notes
would
easily
buy
this
again
o
an
very
tart
beer
thats
a
little
off
balance
but
very
enjoyable
this
one
is
so
tart
it
make
me
worried
it
might
hurt
my
tooth
enamel
but
totally
worth
the
risk
a
really
wonderful
beer
the
funk
is
certainly
the
main
focus
but
it
isnt
over
done
overall
a
great
tartfilled
complexity
and
flavor
profile
makes
this
beer
a
real
winner
in
my
book
the
4
year
old
vintage
definitely
helped
in
that
regard
id
like
to
try
a
2013
one
and
compare
ill
look
for
one
in
the
future
o
i
like
this
gueuze
a
lot
its
more
champagnelike
than
most
which
says
something
for
the
style
quite
a
different
gueuze
not
my
favorite
but
probably
the
best
one
to
introduce
people
to
who
are
foreign
to
the
style
would
pair
amazingly
well
with
food
and
works
as
a
casual
crisp
funky
experience
as
any
good
saison
ahead
of
the
pack
in
terms
of
the
oak
blending
going
on
here
but
definitely
not
as
extreme
recommended
to
fans
of
gueuzes
looking
to
complete
their
list
of
all
the
traditional
lambic
breweries
poured
a
very
clean
copper
tone
with
3
fingers
of
white
foamy
head
which
quickly
dissipated
aroma
of
wine
barrels
strikes
first
lots
of
wine
grapes
oak
flower
petals
funky
cheeselike
aroma
very
tart
and
sour
up
front
but
after
each
sip
you
can
develop
more
flavors
oak
grapes
a
charred
like
bitterness
barrel
cherries
medium
though
light
body
with
a
high
amount
of
carbonation
a
very
nice
gueuze
for
sure
very
glad
i
picked
this
up
if
i
could
do
without
one
thing
its
the
slight
bitterness
but
i
think
i
can
live
with
it
overall
not
my
favorite
as
far
as
gueuze
goes
but
not
bad
would
be
much
better
without
the
metallic
edge
on
the
finish
pours
hazed
gold
with
a
rim
of
whites
smells
of
funk
hay
yogurt
lemons
metal
and
some
black
olive
juice
flavor
carries
that
nice
mouth
watering
tart
i
like
then
some
bicarconatechalk
tones
with
some
lemon
peels
some
metal
some
acetic
quality
and
a
good
yeast
character
in
the
background
light
on
thin
bodied
with
hi
carb
and
a
semi
dry
finish
nice
beer
overall
a
nice
geuze
that
was
pleasant
to
drink
its
sour
as
hell
but
also
has
a
bit
of
sweetness
to
balance
it
out
the
oak
is
very
well
present
and
of
course
the
funkiness
is
there
as
a
beginner
to
belgian
sours
i
have
to
say
that
this
could
very
well
be
a
good
beginner
geuze
4
overall
a
real
easy
drinking
solid
geuze
with
hints
of
simplicity
but
not
much
diversity
complexity
or
extremes
either
o
i
think
it
deserves
higher
than
the
92
it
has
right
now
im
aging
some
from
2007
and
its
drinking
sooo
nice
be
sure
to
drink
it
at
5565
i
think
it
gets
worse
as
it
gets
colder
overall
a
decent
geuze
but
not
a
great
one
odpretty
neat
if
i
am
going
to
have
this
style
i
want
it
to
be
offensively
puckering
this
is
more
subdued
especially
at
its
abv
2007
vintage
with
a
best
by
date
of
2030

deep

a
great
beer
for
sure
had
my
first
geuze
20
odd
years
ago
and
certainly
didnt
get
it
then
this
is
just
a
great
beer
and
a
great
experience
2009
vintage
i
popped
this
bottle
with
a
friend
of
mine
whos
soon
to
tie
the
knot
a
sort
of
toast
to
good
tidings
and
good
futures
it
pours
a
hazy
sunset
amber
topped
by
a
finger
of
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
mild
mandarin
orange
white
wine
grapes
pretty
close
to
chardonnay
light
vanilla
and
a
smattering
of
very
light
cobweb
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
a
good
amount
of
the
inherent
funk
seeping
into
the
mandarin
orange
character
the
body
is
a
lightleaning
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
dry
sticky
finish
overall
a
very
nice
gueuze
hopefully
a
glass
of
healthy
portents
for
my
buddy
and
his
lady
2009
vintage
this
beer
is
outstanding
thanks
to
my
rare
beer
club
for
hooking
this
up
a
real
treat
it
pours
a
radiant
orangey
yellow
color
hazy
but
not
nearly
as
much
as
some
others
the
head
is
over
two
inches
tall
and
leaves
excellent
lacing
the
nose
is
sour
and
punchy
just
how
i
like
it
not
as
complex
as
some
but
still
a
lot
going
on
with
a
lemony
acid
profile
and
a
floral
sort
of
yeast
that
goes
well
with
the
souring
agents
the
flavor
is
just
like
the
nose
very
straightforward
gueuze
im
picking
up
a
little
more
oak
in
this
than
i
usually
do
which
i
think
helps
the
sour
set
in
and
make
a
little
bigger
impression
its
very
refreshing
and
it
hides
its
strength
incredibly
well
im
surprised
at
its
elegance
being
as
big
as
it
is
i
think
the
age
has
mellowed
it
just
a
bit
as
the
carbonation
isnt
quite
as
effervescent
as
it
probably
was
but
the
relaxed
feel
really
works
for
me
and
the
light
body
helps
it
stay
drinkable
overall
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
it
has
that
perfect
sour
funk
profile
that
is
just
right
for
this
time
of
year
this
one
is
a
winner
worthy
of
seeking
out
could
see
giving
it
another
10
years
or
so
too
overall
a
nice
gueuze
but
not
the
best
the
flavor
is
very
pleasant
and
wellbalanced
but
others
seem
to
have
more
complexity
than
this
one
i
may
want
to
visit
this
one
again
after
ive
had
a
few
more
this
is
still
a
new
style
to
me
and
im
trying
to
decide
what
i
do
and
do
not
like
d
a
nice
example
of
style
a
solid
geuze
very
refreshing
and
extremely
easy
to
drink
the
8
is
nearly
imperceptible
taste
it
seems
like
i
could
taste
cork
very
tart
long
lasting
background
mustiness
8
alcohol
barely
noticeable
overall
i
will
certainly
be
picking
up
a
few
more
of
these
about
as
far
on
the
tart
side
as
i
would
think
sours
can
get
a
little
lacking
in
some
complexity
with
fruitiness
and
whatnot
but
nonetheless
a
must
try
for
anyone
seeking
the
extreme
overall
an
excellent
beer
wished
i
could
get
more
of
this
easily
loads
of
sour
tartness
while
remaining
drinkable
overall
a
very
nice
gueuze
that
would
probably
just
get
better
with
more
age
with
that
i
may
buy
a
bottle
the
next
time
i
see
it
to
put
away
for
a
while
mouthfeel
light
crip
mouthfeel
high
carbonation
slight
warming
alcohol
o
executed
fantastically
i
loved
this
beer
my
only
complaint
would
be
that
the
nose
is
a
little
lackluster
dont
judge
a
book
by
its
nose
however
this
brew
is
tasty
overall
i
was
very
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
big
wet
funky
cheesy
notes
make
this
one
a
gueuzeheads
gueuze
could
use
a
bit
more
liveliness
in
the
feel
and
theres
a
very
slight
mellow
alcohol
taste
that
i
could
do
without
still
all
things
considered
i
gotta
go
back
and
get
the
rest
of
the
remaining
bottles
of
these
2007
vintage
this
pours
a
murky
copper
orange
color
with
a
white
foamy
head
the
aroma
is
fairly
acidic
with
lemons
and
apples
in
the
mix
with
other
earthy
tones
the
flavor
is
quite
tart
and
full
in
volume
taste
is
a
very
well
blended
with
a
combination
of
tart
fruits
and
oak
it
finishes
kind
of
dry
and
chalky
very
well
done
only
is
belgium
overall
liked
this
one
way
way
better
than
their
regular
offering
less
musty
and
mouldy
flavors
and
no
added
sweetness
means
this
one
allows
the
tart
green
fruits
and
light
acidity
to
play
a
more
central
roll
more
my
style
at
least
enjoyed
this
one
and
would
gladly
drink
agian
375
ml
caged
and
corked
bottle
2007
vintage
served
in
a
flute
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
dark
gold
color
with
about
an
inch
offwhite
head
that
fizzled
away
quickly
no
lacing
the
brew
smells
like
musty
funk
hay
white
grapes
tart
apples
and
some
lemon
it
tastes
like
bready
malt
musty
funk
light
peppery
spice
wood
and
a
bit
of
pear
and
tart
apple
not
very
tart
at
all
i
think
it
tastes
more
earthy
and
musty
than
sour
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
with
good
soft
carbonation
the
alcohol
in
this
brew
is
well
hidden
it
sure
doesnt
seem
like
its
8
abv
in
the
end
i
liked
this
brew
it
wasnt
as
tart
as
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
but
its
still
tasty
o
decent
gueuze
the
strong
musky
odor
is
the
biggest
knock
and
the
funk
is
high
in
the
flavor
without
enough
tartness
compared
to
your
typical
gueuze
great
beer
but
fell
short
compared
to
the
others
in
the
lineup
pours
a
bright
apricot
color
into
a
snifter
glass
large
frothy
white
head
that
dissolves
to
a
thin
14
inch
head
smells
like
sour
apples
vinegar
and
a
skunkyfunkiness
the
sour
smell
alone
makes
your
mouth
water
tastes
sour
very
vinegar
like
and
lingers
well
after
swallowing
even
minutes
later
i
have
a
sourapple
lemony
taste
in
my
mouth
very
intense
carbonation
keeps
the
beer
pretty
exciting
over
a
30
min
session
overall
a
really
solid
gueuze
would
definitely
buy
again
m
medium
bodied

pours
a
very
hazy
golden
color
with
a
finger
of
head
the
aroma
is
very
nice
its
got
tart
fruits
sour
yeasts
and
oak
the
taste
is
very
oaky
but
it
blends
very
well
with
the
sharp
fruit
tartness
and
full
sourness
the
yeast
aspect
rules
the
roost
after
a
few
seconds
and
then
the
oak
and
a
bit
of
pepper
ride
out
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
lighter
very
dry
and
highly
carbonated
the
drinkability
is
great
there
isnt
a
hint
of
the
abv
overall
a
solid
and
wellbalanced
gueuze
the
oak
aging
really
helps
round
everything
out
one
of
the
best
geuze
i
have
ever
had
2007
vintage
i
plan
on
grabbing
more
bottles
for
age
overall
a
big
winner
a
beer
that
make
you
asks
why
you
dont
drink
this
style
more
very
good
o
a
really
nice
example
of
the
style
not
as
complex
as
some
but
tasty
and
tart
in
the
best
ways
overall
i
had
this
with
some
mussels
and
it
was
perfect
so
smooth
and
very
easy
to
drink
i
never
would
have
guessed
that
its
8
percent
in
the
past
i
have
criticized
beers
with
too
much
oak
fortunately
there
are
other
issues
with
this
gueuze
as
well
its
a
little
too
boozy
with
not
enough
sourness
the
mouthfeel
leaves
a
lot
to
be
desired
still
a
decent
effort
drink
wow
was
very
let
down
by
this
average
gueuze
at
best
hope
my
04
750
ages
a
bit
better
till
i
open
in
2
years
for
10
year
anny
2008
bottle
cloudy
orange
pour
with
a
light
fizzy
head
that
lasted
a
little
while
but
not
the
entire
beer
aroma
is
of
grapefruit
metal
barnyard
and
some
nuttiness
that
i
thought
did
not
belong
there
taste
was
astringent
citrus
mostly
grapefruit
horse
blanket
field
of
hay
more
metal
ugh
and
that
nutty
flavor
at
the
end
palate
is
light
and
refreshing
not
as
good
as
other
bottles
i
have
had
cost
14
99
for
a
750
ml
bottle
overall
a
damp
dry
musty
gueuze
lacks
some
of
the
sharper
and
more
nuanced
complexities
i
expect
from
the
style
pours
a
murky
orange
with
a
foamy
beige
head
that
fades
to
nothing
no
lacing
on
this
one
smell
is
sour
tart
and
funky
with
some
grain
and
acidic
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
an
earthy
and
funky
flavor
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
with
a
great
aroma
that
is
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
o
easy
drinking
beer
you
cannot
feel
the
8
here
classic
belgian
gueuze
in
all
the
aspects
excellent
beer
overall
really
solid
sour
beer
cool
bonus
that
i
got
to
drink
the
last
bottle
of
this
beer
at
the
malthouse
in
madison
and
it
an
old
beer
from
2007
probably
the
oldest
sour
i
have
drank
to
date
but
its
still
tastes
really
nice
2008
vintage
bought
a
corked
bottle
of
this
from
the
tobu
department
store
in
ikebukuro
tokyo
poured
into
a
rochefort
glass
goblet
beautifully
enticing
bottle
with
an
easytoopen
wire
and
cork
system
immediate
sour
scents
of
apple
grape
lemon
and
grapefruit
come
wafting
out
of
the
bottle
and
especially
off
the
top
of
the
glass
once
i
pour
it
cloudy
wheat
hue
with
a
thick
petridish
white
belgian
head
on
it
the
taste
is
sour
and
intense
and
you
have
to
have
an
open
mind
when
you
drink
it
however
if
you
do
the
blended
citrus
and
sweet
fruit
mixed
with
the
sourness
of
aged
lambic
makes
this
an
amazing
brew
enjoyed
it
thoroughly
would
go
well
with
a
white
fish
dish
this
beer
is
great
and
like
any
other
geuze
it
tends
to
grow
on
you
when
emptying
the
bottle
beer
is
highly
drinkable
for
a
sour
the
head
actually
effects
the
mouthfeel
which
i
find
is
a
rarity
with
sours
they
always
seem
to
not
have
or
hold
head
very
well
also
a
b
v
is
quite
respectable
8
i
highly
recommend
to
anyone
lookin
for
a
good
sour
theres
a
reason
these
750ml
bottles
are
12
id
strongly
prefer
a
375ml
tilquin
gueuze
instead
of
this
every
time
really
nice
gueuze
really
starting
to
enjoy
this
style
the
aroma
in
particular
on
this
one
is
probably
my
favorite
aspect
but
the
flavor
is
really
nice
too
with
the
interplay
between
the
little
bit
of
sweetness
and
the
sourness
very
drinkable
overall
my
favorite
gueuze
so
far
o
a
different
kind
of
geueze
very
earthy
and
funky
with
less
mouth
puckeringly
sour
fruit
than
im
used
to
very
delicious
o
a
great
gueuze
very
good
complexity
and
drinkability
im
gonna
have
to
go
pick
up
some
more
of
this
immediately
d
overall
i
would
say
this
is
a
very
approachable
gueuze
for
people
new
to
the
style
it
isnt
over
sourly
but
has
the
classic
flavors
citrus
funk
etc
that
goes
with
the
style
not
bad
o
no
this
is
not
cantillon
but
damn
enjoyable
regardless
if
it
werent
for
moving
on
to
a
different
place
i
would
likely
have
had
more
there
is
something
about
relaxing
in
brussels
with
a
fantastic
geuze
that
makes
me
smile
inside
and
out
if
i
cant
have
a
cantillon
this
will
do
nicely
it
doesnt
get
much
drier
than
this
acidity
seems
to
have
faded
over
the
years
making
the
flavours
more
subtle
and
graceful
o
im
really
glad
i
stumbled
upon
this
geuze
very
pleasant
and
a
great
summer
brew
highly
recommend
it
overall
an
excellent
excellent
beer
ive
havent
had
a
gueze
in
ages
not
sure
why
but
probably
monetary
reasons
im
really
glad
i
picked
up
this
bottle
tonight
very
happy
to
have
tried
this
o
a
pretty
good
gueuze
but
not
my
favorite
i
like
them
a
little
more
sour
with
a
little
less
funk
but
would
be
happy
to
drink
this
one
again
pure
white
head
small
bubbles
fairly
quick
dissipation
with
minimal
lacing
over
hazy
straw
gold
body
a
few
lazy
bubbles
rising
to
surface
big
dose
of
funk
in
the
nose
light
musty
horseblanket
some
citrus
notes
lemon
floral
hops
taste
mirrors
nose
quite
complex
and
funky
a
bit
of
hay
to
offset
the
horseblanket
lemony
esters
for
balance
mouthfeel
is
just
on
the
light
side
of
medium
really
good
effervescence
a
real
revelation
certainly
one
of
the
better
gueuze
ive
had
sure
enough
funky
yummy

overall
an
outstanding
gueuze
one
of
the
best
ive
tried
i
must
get
me
some
more
overall
a
mild
gueuze
not
my
favorite
at
all
i
will
not
be
getting
this
again
o
overall
a
really
nice
gueuze
i
thought
the
nose
was
fantastic
bordering
on
a
5
and
was
really
funky
split
the
bottle
with
my
brother
but
could
have
easily
drank
it
all
myself
look
forward
to
getting
more
of
it
i
liked
it
a
ton
better
then
the
normal
boon
gueuze
but
not
quite
as
much
as
the
boon
oude
kriek
mariage
parfait
o
an
excellent
gueuze
definitely
worth
waiting
for
overall
a
really
tasty
geuze
that
explores
the
sweaty
funky
aspects
of
the
brett
rather
than
folding
to
the
whims
of
the
bacteria
tasty
and
unique
after
removing
the
label
and
picking
my
jaw
up
off
the
floor
i
dive
back
in
to
my
glass
2007
boon

mariage
parfait
your
killing
me
alewatcher
great
beer
overall
i
was
really
looking
forward
to
this
being
my
first
aged
beer
personally
love
the
flavor
although
it
starts
off
funky
i
like
the
change
and
the
finish
a
lot
definitely
a
great
beer
to
enjoy
in
replacement
of
champagne
but
wouldnt
drink
on
any
day
golden
yellow
hue
with
a
modest
white
head
great
sour
and
funky
nose
plenty
of
used
straw
dusty
attic
and
moldy
basement
flavors
are
sour
and
funky
as
well
the
lactic
sour
stings
with
each
sip
lots
of
moldy
wood
and
old
library
books
light
body
with
a
solid
amount
of
carbonation
a
very
nice
gueuze
for
my
my
money
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
brew
this
was
recommended
by
the
bartender
and
it
didnt
disappoint
a
nice
complex
belgian
geuze
that
delivers
i
love
me
some
gueuze
and
this
one
is
no
exception
although
it
doesnt
rank
with
the
beststyle
it
hit
the
spot
tonight
last
pour
and
the
beer
is
now
decidedly
cloudy
with
just
a
wee
bit
of
sediment
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
i
think
this
is
a
must
try
for
the
lovers
of
the
style
o
a
beautifully
aged
and
blended
beer
not
overly
sour
but
definitely
puckering
and
tart
an
awesome
beer
if
you
can
find
it
highly
recommended
d
this
is
a
great
drink
and
will
compliment
the
garliclaced
salmon
im
having
tonight
great
smell
wellbalanced
sour
yeast
and
citrus
flavor
and
great
mouthfeel
definitely
one
of
the
best
gueuze
ive
ever
had
d
a
sipper
too
be
sure
but
a
nice
one
a
very
accessible
geuze
not
too
sour
or
complex
pours
a
golden
orange
w
a
one
finger
white
head
that
quickly
disappears
good
carbonation
and
very
clear
in
appearance
the
nose
is
great
for
the
style
funk
hay
dirt
and
maybe
some
underlying
lemon
really
balanced
and
fantastic
taste
is
similar
to
the
nose
profile
w
some
berries
being
added
to
the
mix
this
is
bitter
but
its
pretty
smooth
overall
very
drinkable
as
well
nice
brett
finish
aftertaste
adds
fruit
and
oak
into
the
mix
feel
is
really
smooth
overall
this
was
a
great
beer
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
cheers
o
very
nice
and
not
very
sour
if
that
sort
of
thing
deters
you
id
have
liked
to
see
the
envelope
pushed
a
little
further
and
am
not
sure
in
this
case
if
the
age
helped
or
hurt
that
aspect
of
the
beer
it
would
pair
excellently
with
bleu
cheese
though
ours
was
eaten
with
aged
cheddar
and
some
other
unnamed
funky
european
cheeses
notes
not
at
all
what
i
thought
this
was
going
to
be
smells
like
a
lambic
tastes
like
a
lambic
but
doesnt
feel
like
a
lambic
maybe
its
the
high
alcohol
content
that
messes
with
it
d
would
make
a
decent
substitute
for
drie
fonteinen
depending
on
availability
and
budget
crushed
the
375ml
bottle
on
my
own
even
with
the
higher
abv
will
definitely
have
this
again
down
the
road
curious
to
see
how
other
vintages
compare
tastes
tart
and
funky
lots
of
nice
light
citrusy
or
lemony
fruit
great
mouthfeel
overall
super
enjoyable
and
refreshing
something
i
would
have
time
and
time
again
da
very
complex
yet
drinkable
beer
with
considerable
abv
that
isnt
detectable
at
all
a
very
interesting
beer
and
one
id
love
to
get
the
chance
to
try
again
super
nice
pop
on
open
pours
a
cloudy
orangered
with
a
frothy
white
head
obviously
well
carbonated
smells
of
brett
funk
oak
lemon
citrus
slight
green
apple
first
sip
is
not
as
sour
funky
or
as
puckering
as
the
nose
indicates
mouthfeel
is
amazing
as
the
beer
just
dances
on
your
tongue
abv
of
8
is
well
hidden
very
nice
indeed
o
i
can
see
why
this
beer
is
regarded
as
a
classic
great
aromas
great
flavor
profile
great
mouthfeel
great
balance
i
will
definitely
purchase
this
again
the
body
was
light
to
medium
in
density
with
modest
carbonation
very
solid
and
a
bellwether
for
the
style
drinkability
and
overall
impression
i
thought
this
one
quite
drinkable
in
that
it
has
a
great
deal
of
complexity
and
is
a
challenge
to
figure
out
the
flavors
and
aromas
that
seem
to
be
present
i
think
it
may
need
a
bit
more
maturity
in
the
bottle
to
come
closer
to
its
full
potential
a
pretty
safe
statement
given
that
its
best
by
date
is
about
19
years
in
the
future
overall
im
pleased
to
have
tried
one
and
i
think
it
is
clearly
worth
having
on
the
shopping
list
while
at
the
end
of
the
day
i
might
prefer
a
different
geuze
over
this
one
this
would
make
a
worth
while
and
interesting
alternative
o
a
very
balanced
beer
excellent
in
many
ways
probably
underrated
sour
but
traditional
as
well
o
there
is
some
alcohol
burn
and
this
could
be
slightly
more
flavorful
but
this
is
a
very
solid
gueuze
its
quite
enjoyable
this
is
a
solid
beer
but
not
my
favorite
gueuze
farmhouse
funk
ohh
so
inviting
this
was
tremendously
tart
and
sour
lots
of
grape
and
apple
tones
all
over
this
one
really
pushing
the
senses
to
the
limits
of
what
they
could
possible
endure
but
you
know
in
a
good
way
a
wonderful
rich
tart
sour
funky
explosion
of
flavor
picking
up
right
where
the
aroma
left
off
deep
sour
apple
and
grape
flavors
are
all
over
this
one
really
pushing
this
forward
on
you
the
finish
was
dry
and
very
long
lingering
leaving
you
desperately
craving
another
overall
after
7
years
in
the
bottle
and
with
8
alcohol
i
would
have
expected
this
to
be
blisteringly
sour
but
that
was
not
the
case
this
was
one
of
more
mild
gueuzes
i
have
had
pale
orange
in
color
with
no
head
on
the
pour
perhaps
the
age
has
taken
the
wind
out
of
the
head
fruity
and
tart
in
the
nose
like
the
aroma
of
sweettarts
thats
something
i
like
the
beer
tastes
like
it
was
made
awhile
back
its
very
low
in
carbonation
the
acidity
is
greatly
faded
and
overall
the
flavor
is
mellower
perhaps
i
enjoy
the
pucker
of
a
fresh
gueuze
greater
than
the
mellowness
of
an
aged
one
but
i
had
higher
hopes
for
this
8
year
old
mariage
parfait
o
lovely
absolutely
lovely
i
have
the
entire
bottle
to
myself
and
im
quite
pleased
about
that
this
is
the
only
vintage
ive
had
but
i
will
definately
be
seeking
out
more
after
this
one
great
geuze
not
like
over
powering
sour
but
very
well
balanced
and
complex
cheers
to
brouwerij
boon
another
top
notch
geuze
a
decent
and
certainly
a
good
gueuze
and
i
cannot
say
this
definitively
because
i
wasnt
lucky
enough
to
have
a
fresh
bottle
but
i
think
this
bottle
has
faded
and
would
have
been
far
better
years
ago
o
disappointing
what
flavors
do
come
out
are
flat
and
unappealing
the
aroma
had
some
good
qualities
that
made
me
look
forward
to
the
taste
but
none
of
that
came
through
pours
golden
yellow
with
a
good
sized
white
head
good
lacing
smells
of
fresh
lemon
with
a
good
amount
of
barnyard
funk
taste
is
not
really
as
sour
as
expected
actually
not
that
sour
at
all
it
tastes
like
a
sugar
lemon
with
a
big
presence
of
lactic
funk
very
refershing
mouthfeel
is
a
typical
gueuze
carbonation
seems
a
bit
high
for
a
7
year
old
beer
overall
refreshing
beer
pretty
good
intensity
seems
to
be
the
name
of
the
game
with
this
beer
and
the
mouthfeel
is
no
exception
seemingly
enamel
stripping
from
the
acidic
tartness
and
sourness
but
the
beer
has
a
short
lived
initial
creaminess
that
makes
a
quick
transition
into
a
very
refreshing
tartness
medium
astringency
citrus
and
hop
bitterness
and
a
powderydry
finish
late
but
then
it
slams
shut
providing
a
lemony
brine
flavor
with
an
exhale
then
were
ready
for
another
sip
overall
this
isnt
bad
but
certainly
not
worth
the
price
tag
to
me
i
am
more
than
happy
to
have
more
sour
gueuzes
with
less
fruit
and
funk
but
thats
just
me
this
is
certainly
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
my
favorite
take
on
the
style
overall
an
drink
i
prefer
the
oude
geuze
though
as
it
is
less
musky
it
has
some
quite
skunky
characteristics
also
i
would
like
to
note
that
kkipple
said
that
when
he
saw
the
pic
of
this
beer
when
i
was
drinking
it
that
it
was
the
first
time
there
was
a
photo
with
a
geuze
and
an
ar15
in
the
same
shot
just
thought
i
should
point
that
out
o
unfortunately
this
isnt
living
up
to
the
promise
of
the
aroma
for
me
its
a
little
more
flavorful
as
it
warms
up
and
the
carbonation
dies
down
but
the
bitter
metallic
finish
remains
nowhere
near
the
top
of
the
gueuze
world
imo
update
i
got
a
chance
to
share
a
750ml
bottle
of
the
04
vintage
at
a
recent
tasting
thanks
to
iirc
knifestyles
for
putting
his
lambic
basket
to
use
on
this
brew
from
notes
standard
nicely
carbonated
appearance
very
dry
chalky
herbal
grassy
leafy
aroma
tastes
quite
nice
with
good
balance
between
grassiness
barnyard
funk
and
sour
fruit
super
dry
slightly
astringent
finish
prickly
lively
feel
decidedly
better
than
the
06
bottle
i
reviewed
above
but
still
nowhere
near
the
top
echelon
of
geuzes
44444
o
this
beer
embodied
the
musty
earthy
aged
characteristics
sought
out
in
gueuzes
this
contrasts
well
with
the
qualities
of
a
drie
fonteinen
gueuze
of
which
were
much
fresher
and
more
citrus
focused
it
would
be
very
interesting
to
blend
the
two
together
o
quality
beer
but
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
have
it
again
bit
too
maltysweet
for
my
money
and
id
like
more
pucker
in
the
taste
nonsour
drinkers
may
well
enjoy
this
3
5
overall
it
is
a
solid
gueuze
smells
better
than
it
tastes
but
it
is
still
good
just
seems
to
be
missing
something
crucial
in
the
taste
dr
a
good
sunday
morning
beer
but
far
from
a
great
fruit
beer
certainly
worth
a
go
for
any
beer
fanatic
but
its
not
easy
on
the
wallet
at
least
not
in
dublin
at
6
20
quid
good
for
gueuze
and
i
need
to
revisit
it
to
go
into
more
detail
once
im
more
familiar
with
the
style
od
nice
not
amazing
but
good
stuff
i
always
like
how
geuze
has
an
element
of
sweetness
to
balance
against
the
lambics
sourness
this
came
close
to
being
great
but
lacked
as
alot
of
the
aroma
didnt
come
through
to
the
taste
a
good
beer
very
good
very
complex
not
so
demanding
updated
from
a
beer
tasting
at
the
de
klomp
of
the
2005
vintage
not
quite
a
mindblowing
beer
pleasantly
flavoured
and
fermented
though
for
enjoyable
drinking
o
good
drinkability
for
the
absent
alcohol
and
profile
of
this
beer
i
could
have
easily
put
this
down
alone
i
need
to
get
some
more
of
this
one
and
possibly
for
the
head
table
of
my
wedding
unique
and
balanced
an
interesting
gueuze
and
perhaps
one
of
the
more
funky
and
unusual
ones
ive
tried
the
blending
gives
such
wonderful
scope
for
complexity
and
experimentation
and
i
have
to
say
i
approve
of
this
one
beer
is
bright
with
carbonation
thin
body
and
an
acetic
bite
i
like
this
beer
more
than
i
thought
i
would
i
had
the
pm
kriek
earlier
and
was
underwhelmed
but
this
gueuze
is
great
the
lactic
acid
gives
the
beer
a
swimming
creaminess
and
has
a
great
finish
o
i
loved
this
one
and
it
eclipses
the
standard
geuze
for
me
because
its
so
well
balanced
well
worth
a
try
d
it
was
good
but
was
missing
something
i
think
some
more
lactic
acid
would
bring
this
to
the
better
examples
of
this
style
still
quite
enjoyable
and
one
of
the
most
approachable
examples
of
the
style
out
there
goes
down
super
easy
and
it
refreshing
with
enough
complexity
to
keep
you
coming
back
overall
a
very
tasty
brew
and
a
pleasant
experience
im
glad
to
have
another
bottle
in
the
cellar
recommended
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
with
low
carbonation
a
touch
of
acetic
character
not
a
bad
gueuze
but
lacks
complexity
a
serious
geuze
probably
not
for
lambic
virgins
but
rewarding
for
the
beer
geek
the
mariage
parfait
combines
the
soft
approachable
acid
of
hannsens
with
the
bitter
citrus
of
girardin
black
label
and
an
elevated
alcohol
content
i
have
never
experienced
before
the
reult
is
a
damn
fine
gueuze
balanced
complex
ageworthy
d
didnt
have
all
that
much
seemed
a
bit
weird
but
tasty
and
complex
enough
could
have
easily
enjoyed
more
d
might
be
a
touch
over
carbonated
having
had
boon
gueuze
right
before
this
this
one
is
only
a
touch
more
complex
in
taste
and
similar
in
aroma
d
a
great
gueuze
milder
than
some
in
the
sour
category
but
carries
a
superb
balance
of
flavors
crisp
and
refreshing
not
the
best
but
still
top
notch
this
is
a
golden
beer
mostly
clear
except
for
notable
suspended
sediment
the
rises
quickly
but
falls
within
minutes
to
a
soapy
film
great
aroma
sour
and
barnyard
funky
and
a
little
fruity
its
not
an
overpowering
aroma
but
is
very
well
subtle
and
nice
a
little
perfume
and
malt
are
also
there
nice
lambic
smells
the
taste
is
great
not
as
sour
as
expected
a
little
bitter
funky
sharp
and
musty
lingering
bitterness
and
some
woodcharacteristics
moderately
dry
but
not
nearly
as
dry
as
i
anticipated
medium
in
body
with
some
carbonation
spritziness
this
is
a
very
good
geuze
being
both
approachable
and
rewarding
i
had
it
with
some
fruit
aged
parmigianoreggiano
and
thick
balsamic
vinegar
2004
vintage
and
it
pours
a
golden
honeyorange
hue
with
nice
carbonation
that
leaves
behind
a
one
finger
head
and
no
lacingthe
smell
is
very
typical
of
a
gueuze
with
aromas
of
apple
cidervinegarmusty
barnyard
funk
and
some
white
wineit
has
a
nice
lightmedium
bodied
mouthfeel
which
is
perfectly
carbonated
and
feels
almost
like
a
nice
white
wine
but
then
the
flavour
lets
you
know
you
are
drinking
a
gueuze
with
tastes
of
apple
cidervinegarhaywhite
grapes
and
it
finishes
with
a
musty
sourness
that
makes
you
come
back
for
another
sip
and
overall
i
really
like
it
and
would
buy
again
without
doubt
cheers
this
is
champagne
like
with
enough
carbonation
to
go
very
well
with
rich
food
i
am
going
to
buy
some
to
cellar
and
some
to
enjoy
this
summer
d
i
cant
drink
much
of
this
beer
at
all
had
to
share
the
bottle
experiences
like
this
are
leading
me
to
believe
that
gueze
just
isnt
for
me
i
cant
recommend
it
db
funk
domination
in
both
aroma
and
flavor
overall
it
reminds
me
of
a
hay
barn
with
some
fruit
in
it
different
from
all
gueuze
i
have
sampled
a
little
too
farmy
at
first
but
opens
up
nicely
when
it
warms
it
is
still
pretty
barnyardforward
though
a
2004
bottle
nice
golden
bronze
color
with
a
bit
of
haze
pours
with
a
loose
white
head
initially
this
beer
is
shocking
in
its
mildness
this
beer
has
little
resemblance
to
a
cantillon
geuze
even
cuvée
rené
is
more
sour
nonetheless
this
beer
has
an
assertive
tartness
balanced
with
a
subtle
sweetness
its
flavor
lacks
the
barnyard
funk
of
its
aroma
it
finishes
in
a
broad
woody
yeasty
dryness
mixed
this
beer
has
a
medium
body
kept
light
with
a
refreshing
generous
effervescence
this
8
beer
tastes
more
like
4
phenomenal
one
of
the
most
funky
geuzes
i
have
had
yet
not
overpowering
but
definitely
the
main
flavor
here
very
good
stuff
i
could
only
imagine
this
getting
even
more
funky
however
not
too
sure
about
the
sourness
its
fairly
light
and
quite
approachable
da
tasty
approachable
gueuze
that
would
make
a
great
introduction
to
the

at

orange
color
with

small
head
and
some
lace

aroma
is
barnyardy
with
some
lemon
and
fruit
rind
with
a
bit
of
fresh
hay
the
tiniest
bit
of
dirty
laundry
sneaks
in
about
halfway
through
the
bottle
the
flavor
is
tart
and
dry
with
some
nice
zestiness
akin
to
a
champagne
or
a
cava
there
is
a
mild
fruitiness
with
some
lemon
rind
and
new
oak
the
beer
seems
to
be
sour
right
in
the
back
and
as
the
bottle
progresses
this
becomes
more
pronounced
quite
the
departure
from
the
very
sour
geuze
made
the
standard
in
my
mind
at
least
by
3
fonteinen
cantillon
but
well
nuanced
and
enjoyable
none
the
less
d
this
gueuze
is
one
that
i
hope
to
revisit
in
the
very
near
future
if
you
see
this
on
the
shelf
grab
it
d
purchased
3
of
these
and
drank
them
all
in
one
sitting
what
an
awesome
brew
pale
golden
color
with
good
carbonation
smells
like
grapes
and
funk
tastes
like
white
grapes
and
brett
real
crisp
clean
taste
gave
it
to
some
champagne
drinkers
and
they
loved
it
nice
light
body
very
refreshing
feels
great
in
my
mouth
highly
drinkable
i
could
put
back
a
750
of
this
no
problem
brett
forward
all
around
damp
earth
and
hay
with
slight
lemon
acidity
bone
dry
and
just
a
predominately
funky
very
easy
to
drink
a
750
by
yourself
since
the
acidity
is
not
overpowering
at
all
a
full
flavoured
rich
and
inviting
gueuze
the
sourness
is
present
but
doesnt
dominate
and
on
the
whole
this
is
very
easy
to
drink
a
top
class
gueuze
d
a
tasty
funky
gueuze
has
some
minor
imperfections
that
keep
it
from
the
top
tier
but
a
gueuze
i
wouldnt
mind
stocking
in
my
cellar
d
something
id
love
to
drink
another
bottle
of
later
down
the
line
a
very
nice
balanced
sour
and
thats
something
thats
rarely
pulled
off
well
my
other
bottle
will
go
the
distance
ill
report
back
in
2027
heh
easy
to
drink
dry
finish
the
coating
is
dry
as
well
light

with
lots
of
carbonation
overall
a
fine
lambic
from
boon
that
i
cant
wait
to
see
develop
a
little
bit
more
with
age
overall
i
liked
this
its
a
bit
thin
and
subdued
in
the
flavor
but
i
like
whats
there
dthis
is
pretty
poor
tons
of
burnt
sugars
and
seems
to
have
oxidized
lots
of
scotch
and
sherry
notes
much
like
a
harsh
liquor

a
subtle
yet
tasty
beer
if
you
see
it
buy
it

lots
8
abv
is
hardly
there
a
great
geuze
that
i
wish
to
find
a
fresh
bottle
to
compare
one
day
i
dont
think
i
could
do
a
bottle
to
the
head
but
this
remains
drinkable
though
not
memorable
d
this
is
one
tasty
gueuze
complex
and
deep
but
very
drinkable
i
love
it
the
mouthfeel
is
good
but
standard
for
a
high
quality
gueuze
drinkability
is
good
but
i
dont
think
i
would
put
this
alongside
the
titans
of
the
style
overall
this
beer
is
extremely
high
quality
and
worth
the
purchase
glad
to
have
the
opportunity
to
drink
it
d
this
one
may
not
yet
have
reached
its
prime
or
may
yet
to
be
there
a
good
gueuze
but
not
the
best
on
ive
had
a
2005
vintage
pours
cloudy
orange
with
not
much
carbonation
aromas
of
strawberry
pineapple
and
apple
juice
flavors
of
orange
with
a
nice
sourness
and
slight
astringency
the
astringency
reminds
me
of
their
regular
old
gueuze
but
it
isnt
as
detracting
overall
way
better
than
their
normal
oude
gueuze
i
loved
this
its
my
kind
of
beer
and
i
could
drink
it
all
day
long
i
had
no
idea
it
was
8
as
it
hides
the
alcohol
so
well
in
an
intensely
funky
and
intense
gueuze
experience
drinkability
good
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
very
crisp
and
not
overly
tart
beer
for
the
style
one
of
the
few
that
i
could
sip
on

its

thing
i
got
to
it
when
when
i
did
on

menu
churchills
in

a

pricey
but
what
the
heck
poured
with
minimal
carbonation
and
no
head
into
a
duvel
goblet
golden
a
little
cloudy

is
a
little
musty

taste
is
a
bit
tart
but
not
substantially
so
pretty
easy
drinking
a
touch
of
brett
maybe
some
granny
smith
apples
not
exceedingly
dry
on
the
finish
a

pleasant
nice

feel

glad
i
bought
it
if
i
saw
it
on
draft
id
try
it
again
just
to
see
how
it
differs
this
wasnt
quite
what
i
had
in
mind
when
i
opened
the
bottle
but
the
people
at
boon
know
gueuze
a
lot
better
than
me
cant
wait
till
i
turn
50
to
try
the
other
one
i
bought
d
this
is
easy
for
me
to
drink
its
actually
too
easy
i
was
expecting
more
of
a
challenge
while
a
tasty
gueuze
i
think
i
prefer
the
regular
boon
or
oud
beersel
versions
of
course
that
preference
in
no
way
precludes
a
good
rating
as
it
is
supremely
easy
to
drink
especially
given
its
alcohol
level
dont
get
me
wrong
its
an
excellent
beer
one
that
i
would
be
happy
to
drink
again
its
just
that
i
was
expecting
an
overall
4

0
beer
d
very
good
geuze
overall
a
touch
harsh
on
the
bitter
side
if
i
have
to
pick
a
fault
at
least
to
my
tastes
this
only
mildly
detracts
from
the
drinkability
though
glad
to
get
to
try
this
i
see
more
bottles
of
this
one
in
my
future
drinkability
the
hardcore
gueuze
fans
ding
it
for
its
lack
of
intensity
on
the
sour
scale
but
that
makes
it
all
the
more
appealing
to
us
sweetdna
types
i
like
this
one
and
can
only
guess
what
another
decade
will
do
to
it
a
great
one
to
share
lots
of
flavor
for
everyone
all
in
all
worth
repeating
a
traditional

gueuze
spontaneously

a

boon
gueuze
which
is
most
likely
sweetened
and
not
conditioned
cloudy
golden
with
little
head
aroma
of
barnyard
mustiness
citrus
flavors
with
moderate
sourness
and
a
dry
bitter
finish
ages
well
this
is
a
decent
gueuze
that
has
more
complexity
in
the
flavor
than
the
nose
with
the
funky
starting
to
show
itself
i
imagine
itll
get
even
bigger
over
time
its
very
drinkable
and
the
funky
and
sourness
is
not
overpowering
p
s
i
just
went
to
my
desk
24
hours
later
and
found
that
the
bottle
was
open
and
still
on
the
desk
with
about
3
inches
left
i
tried
it
it
was
still
carbonated
although
a
bit
reduced
and
with
all
of
the
above
characteristics
although
perhaps
a
bit
less
intense
the
flavor
tasted
a
bit
past
its
prime
with
a
funky
yeast
body
and
a
sour
metallic
finish
that
has
a
vinous
greenery
to
it
someone
at
the
tasting
remarked
that
it
reminded
them
of
gunpowder
uberdry
acidic
back
with
a
light
mouthfeel
and
lighter
carbonation
cant
say
id
ever
buy
this
for
myself
but
it
was
definitely
an
interesting
beer
to
try
after
having
sampled
some
of
the
best
gueuzes
and
lambics
last
night
at
ebenezers
i
decidided
why
stop
there
during
the
lecture
that
i
attended
this
beer
was
mentioned
more
than
once
it
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
fizzy
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
musty
basement
smells
kick
things
off
followed
by
a
combination
of
funk
and
lactic
acid
light
citrus
fruit
melds
really
well
together
here
with
the
funkiness
taste
begins
very
dry
like
champagne
and
really
coats
the
mouth
all
the
way
more
subtle
tart
notes
come
in
midway
through
and
leave
things
as
they
begun
dry
and
very
similar
to
a
champagne
or
cider
carbonation
makes
it
a
refreshing
beverage
and
despite
the
8
alcohol
count
it
comes
off
as
an
easy
drinker
our
lecturer
last
night
told
us
that
what
he
looks
for
in
a
good
gueuze
is
a
nice
balanced
profile
and
i
think
that
is
what
we
have
here
white
wine
and
champagne
lovers
should
give
drinks
like
these
a
chance
as
expected
boon
has
a
blended
beer
here
of
exceptional
quality
d
a
good
gueuze
it
has
lots
of
character
but
the
flavors
cant
keep
up
with
the
fantastic
aromas
in
the
smell
the
flavor
is
a
little
too
much
on
the
fruity
side
and
there
is
something
in
the
finish
that
bothers
me
its
hard
to
put
my
finger
on
it
but
something
seems
off
but
its
very
interesting
to
see
that
a
gueuze
can
handle
such
a
high
abv
without
it
even
getting
noticeable
overall
a
very
nice
beer
from
a
off
style
would
recommend
and
would
have
again
and
again
i
think
ive
heard
that
the
750ml
bottles
are
better
or
maybe
this
just
needs
age
so
that
the
yeast
can
coax
out
more
flavor
d
i
liked
this
beer
a
lot
but
will
freely
admit
it
was
my
first
gueuze
so
i
have
little
frame
of
reference
still
it
was
pretty
easy
to
drink
the
sourness
was
there
but
not
overpowering
the
abv
stayed
very
well
hidden
and
it
was
quite
refreshing
an
excellent
beer
comparisons
to
champagne
are
right
on
not
overly
tart
very
refreshing
and
drinkable
drinkability
light
and
tart
but
it
is
missing
something
entirely
average
i
really
just
shrugged
the
shoulders
and
moved
on
d
overall
very
well
balanced
for
the
style
i
really
enjoyed
it
and
think
its
definitely
worth
a
try
cheers
drinkability
this
goes
down
fast
for
a
gueuze
and
id
like
another
please
definitely
a
very
nice
beer
and
worth
trying
i
would
rate
this
slightly
lower
than
some
other
gueuzes
e
g
cantillon
classic
which
seem
to
be
more
expressive
with
regards
to
funk
and
tartness
medium
body
with
low
carbonation
very
well
balanced
outstanding
i
wouldnt
pass
this
beer
up
if
you
find
it
on
tap
ive
yet
to
come
across
a
bottle
of
it
but
when
i
do
i
will
pick
it
up
drinkability
is
pretty
good
a
really
nice
geuze
the
first
sip
i
didnt
love
those
metal
notes
but
i
quickly
got
on
board
and
really
enjoyed
it
by
the
end
still
an
enamel
stripper
and
not
super
cheap
youre
not
gonna
drink
a
lot
of
these
at
once
i
found
this
to
be
quite
a
nice
treat
and
much
more
impressive
than
their
standard
release
pours
a
glowing
straw
color
with
a
silky
tan
head
the
nose
has
manure
rotting
wood
horse
blanket
tart
citrus
fruits
musty
wet
soil
and
sweet
candy
malts
taste
is
well
balanced
and
equally
complex
tart
and
funky
up
front
with
a
sweet
and
fruity
finish
crisp
body
is
a
bit
thin
but
well
carbonated
with
a
dry
finish
great
example
of
the
style
somewhat
listless
although
the
appearance
warned
me
of
this
definitely
a
sipper
the
person
i
went
out
with
took
a
sip
and
quipped
id
need
to
pair
this
with
food
i
feel
exactly
the
opposite
as
this
shares
everything
in
common
with
great
italian
aperitifs
it
whets
your
appetite
makes
your
stomach
rumbles
and
gets
your
taste
buds
salivating
enjoyed
at
the
long
room
mfis
decent
u
can
definitely
feel
the
bubbles
as
well
as
a
bit
of
tartness
shared
a
few
five
and
sixyearold
bottles
with
friends
at
den
trollekelder
in
gent
what
a
treat
it
seemed
fairly
similar
to
the
girardin
1882
black
label
for
the
dry
oaky
flavor
that
permeated
the
beer
additionally
there
were
thin
tart
lemon
notes
while
mouth
puckering
sour
tang
finished
the
beer
i
wish
id
kept
better
notes
on
this
beer
it
was
damn
good

hazy

with

frothy
white

it
smells
like
citrus
and
very
briefly
like
manure
the
taste
is
bandaid
and
rotting
citrus
fruit
with
mold
this
wasnt
a
bad
beer
but
it
wasnt
my
cup
of
tea
as
far
as
gueuze
goes
extremely
drinkable
light
mouthfeel
with
only
a
little
bit
of
that
clinging
sour
d
oh
so
nice
this
beer
is
all
around
good
times
this
beer
doest
set
heavy
whatsoever
and
that
slight
dryness
really
keeps
you
drinking
lovely
sure
the
aroma
really
threw
me
off
but
it
makes
up
for
it
in
every
other
category
that
feel
really
brings
all
this
together
and
the
flavors
are
damned
good
really
starting
to
jump
into
these
geuze
styles
and
this
is
damned
good
get
some
love
some
this
is
an
all
around
solid
gueuze
from
boon
and
one
i
wouldnt
hesitate
to
pick
up
again
its
not
bracingly
sour
or
hugely
complex
but
makes
for
an
enjoyable
sipper
and
approachable
gueuze
next
time
i
should
have
it
a
bit
warmer
as
it
does
mellow
out
and
have
a
more
pollen
finish
i
will
pick
up
more
of
this
overall
its
a
big
bark
with
a
little
biteor
the
nose
was
huge
and
the
flavor
was
moderate
very
nice
d
the
8
alcohol
is
wellhidden
behind
the
oak
and
wild
buggers
if
i
could
find
more
of
this
id
snap
it
up
drinkability
this
was
a
sipper
i
shared
a
bottle
with
the
other
patrons
and
it
took
us
a
bit
to
get
through
the
whole
thing
that
was
to
be
expected
though
drinkability
well
this
is
a
5
year
old
bottle
of
beer
that
has
an
extra
3
years
added
on
that
so
rarity
comes
into
play
but
its
such
a
refreshing
mark
of
quality
among
so
many
wanna
be
sours
that
i
gave
it
a
five
such
a
great
brew
4
m4
d
an
interesting
step
forward
from
the
sharper
but
more
tasty
boons
old
geuze
i
guess
it
does
take
some
more
time
for
this
beer
to
release
its
concealed
complexity
but
this
beer
as
young
as
it
is
has
already
shown
a
mellow
body
not
easy
to
achieve
for
the
style
ill
certainly
revisit
this
nice
beer
maybe
with
a
tenyearold
sample
next
time
overall
a
very
nice
geueze
not
as
sour
as
most
might
expect
but
make
no
mistake
this
is
a
sour
lambic
awesome
flavor
profile
and
i
like
the
little
extra
carbo
boost
a
fine
lambic
and
one
i
am
excited
to
put
some
more
age
on
good
mouthfeel
on
a
bad
beer
i
feel
so
guilty
recommending
this
to
someone
i
confused
it
with

earthy

not

to
the

still
had

dark

very
potent
sour
aromas
of
lemon
and
orange
with
undertones
of
dried
wood
way
more
mellow
in
the
mouth
than
expected
the
sour
fruits
are
upfront
again
but
without
being
overly
tart
or
sour
mild
wood
and
funk
are
present
as
well
rounded
mouthfeel
without
the
heavy
acidic
attack
of
a
cantillon
or
girardin
but
still
quite
dry
good
stuff
but
my
preference
would
be
for
a
more
sour
gueuze
d
for
a
big
sour
beer
this
isnt
too
hard
to
drink
its
difficult
to
judge
these
beers
because
ive
had
very
few
i
think
i
prefered
the
regular
boon
geuze
better
i
wanted
to
open
this
after
having
a
small
taste
of
it
on
saturday
courtesy
of
chefscott79
i
was
not
very
impressed
the
first
time
i
tried
it
but
tonight
it
was
better
an
above
average
gueuze
that
did
not
blow
me
away
or
anything
but
worth
my
money
would
drink
again
recommended
poured
into
a
wine
glass

of

nice

a
good
intro
to
gueuze
md
light
to
medium
bodied
very
crisp
and
refreshing
the
tartness
might
make
it
a
tough
one
on
the
drinkability
scale
the
three
fontienen
is
much
more
of
a
session
beer
and
i
would
buy
it
first
if
it
were
redily
available
d
i
craved
something
sour
and
this
is
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
i
doubt
ill
pick
it
up
again
nice
fine
champagne
like
carbonation
the
taste
is
rich
yet
amazingly
subtle
well
balanced
tart
but
less
than
the
average
oaky
and
fruity
with
a
very
dry
finish
very
well
balanced
not
excessively
tart
or
acidic
no
alcohol
to
be

easy

a

given
the

have
a
neutral

not
a

a
wonderful

wonderful

this

still

another

satsifying
good

d
decent
for
the
style
it
didnt
blow
me
away
in
any
one
area
but
it
just
felt
like
a
real
solid
gueuze
a
style
im
trying
to
become
more
familiar
with
d
a
nice
tasty
lambic
from
boon
another
winner
just
wish
it
wasnt
so
pricey
good
but
not
mindblowing
personally
i
think
they
overdid
it
on
the
alcohol
which
leads
to
the
waxy
taste
and
texture
this
beer
poured
a
cloudy
yellow
color
and
formed
a
huge
foamy
white
head
that
left
latticed
lace
as
it
slowly
subsided
a
medium
amount
of
carbonation
is
present
an
aroma
of
malt
yeast
lemon
and
barnyardmustiness
the
flavor
was
of
citrus
pepper
some
of
the
yeast
and
barnyard
elements
also
are
present
the
body
is
medium
light
and
finish
has
the
tartness
one
expects
from
the
style
a
nice
beer
truly
a
perfect
marriage
of
the
old
and
new
lambics
pours
a
hazy
golden
with
a
tight
white
head
that
sticks
around
as
a
cap
nice
spicy
and
herbal
notes
in
the
aroma
with
black
pepper
coriander
and
lemon
tastes
very
saisonlike
with
some
crisp
clean
lemony
sourness
black
pepper
coriander
and
the
barest
hint
of
funkiness
at
the
finish
the
funkiness
increases
somewhat
as
the
beer
warms
slightly
bitter
herbalness
at
the
end
the
mouthfeel
is
quenching
refreshing
and
complex
great
beer
and
even
a
bit
challenging
while
completely
refreshing
drinkability
exceptional
bone
dry
less
acidic
than
most
and
overall
mild
chugable
maybe
a
nice
aperitif
with
some
fruit
especially
outdoors
on
a
warm
day
id
treat
it
like
a
bottle
of
champagne
but
it
has
more
tartness
and
mustiness
than
a
champagne
would
i
enjoy
all
these
characteristics
separately
and
they
mesh
very
well
here
thanks
ben
wow
what
a
day
6
wonderful
brew
sampled
tastes
tart
funky
and
grassy
also
has
a
hit
of
acidic
fruits
the
more
i
drink
this
beer
the
more
i
am
able
to
appreciate
it
d
one
is
enough
for
me
this
beer
is
interesting
and
i
wish
i
could
get
a
fresher
bottle
to
compare
it
even
though
the
expiration
date
is
16yrs
in
the
future
i
think
some
light
got
to
this
one
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
one
of
my
favorites
has
a
golden
color
that
makes
it
look
almost
lit
from
within
it
is
extremely
active
building
up
surpisingly
almost
no
head
but
leaving
a
great
lacing
genuinely
one
of
the
most
interesting
looking
beers
ive
ever
seen
the
smell
is
apricots
bananas
sour
cherries
and
pepper
the
taste
is
predominately
dry
with
some
fruit
then
a
crisp
finish
this
a
fantastic
gueuzevery
very
balanced
the
mouthfeel
is
soft
buttery
the
drinkability
is
good
but
as
with
almost
all
gueueze
for
me
the
sourness
limits
this
all
in
all
one
of
the
very
best
of
the
style
ive
had
of
course
your
friends
that
dont
like
beer
will
still
hate
it
pale
yellowish
watery
honey
like
pour
with
a
small
offwhite
head
smell
is
fruity
and
funky
sharp
bubbly
mouthfeel
that
is
a
bit
too
carbonated
actually
taste
is
tart
acidic
and
bland
with
no
sweetness
nothing
appealing
to
me
couldnt
finish
my
sample
size
i
paired
the
second
glass
with
three
cheeses
humboldt
fog
goat
cheese
dubliner
and
parmigianoreggiano
the
humboldt
fog
was
a
perfect
match
the
dubliner
was
also
an
excellent
match
the
parmesan
pairs
well
but
not
outstandingly
so
the
beer
poured
a
golden
copper
body
clear
with
a
strong
streem
of
bubbles
running
to
the
top
of
my
glass
the
head
was
rather
thick
but
collapsed
rather
quickly
a
solid
ring
was
left
behind
the
nose
was
funky
and
had
a
bit
of
citrus
the
taste
was
woody
funky
and
had
notes
of
vanilla
the
taste
was
also
sour
a
bit
tart
but
very
pleasing
to
the
senses
overall
a
well
balanced
and
smooth
beer
stopped
by
the
thirsty
monk
in
ashville
and
had
a
bottle
of
this
beauty
i
told
the
bartender
i
wanted
the
most
sour
beer
he
had
for
some
reason
i
was
in
the
mood
for
a
super
sour
beer
and
this
is
what
he
brought
out
pours
into
a
cylindrical
a
pale
straw
color
with
a

definitely
sour
in
the
taste
a
tart
and

feel
with
a
little

of
saltiness
i
really
liked
this
one
and
will
probably
have
it
againg
next
time
i
am
in
the
thirsty
monk
this
is
a
real
winner
cleaner
than
other
great
gueuzes
but
still
chock
full
of
complexity
and
uber
dryness
very
delicious
i
will
definitely
seek
this
out
again

there
are

this

causing
me
to
lower
the

high

its

but
the

lowers
the

if

my
score
will
be
higher

a
great

quencher
on

day
i
may
have
just
gotten
an
old
bottle
but
i
was
not
nearly
as
impressed
with
this
one
as
i
have
been
other
lambics
a
great
refreshing
beer
perfect
marriage
indeed
malty
character
keeps
the
funky
gueuze
spelled
geuze
by
this
brewery
fairly
mild
for
the
style
but
allowing
enough
of
it
to
come
through
a
great
unique
brew
try
pairing
with
a
creamy
cheese
recommended
a
nice
gueuze
id
take
girardin
any
day
over
this

this
is
solid
dry
tart
hay
and
citrus
flavors
up

sour
vague
fruits
over
honeyish
malt
midpalate
metallic
notes
near
the

grows
increasingly
sour

moderate
barnyard
funk
throughout
very
refreshing
and
not
overly
sour
moderatebodied
with
a
lively
feel
nice
after
drinking
this
one
wonders
why
something
like
sam
adamss
cherry
lambic
is
allowed
to
be
called
a
lambic
fairly
astringent
crisp
mouthfeel
thin
but
spritzy
with
champagnelike
carbonation
a
good
intro
to
gueuze
very
drinkable
and
approachable
but
its
not
quite
as
good
as
their
unblended
lambic
overall
an
exceptionally
complex
yet
very
drinkable
beer
even
if
a
tad
on
the
expensive
side
6
99
for
the
bottle
thanks
phatz
for
the
sours
drinkability
i
didnt
even
realize
how
much
alcohol
was
in
this
beer
until
this
review
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
just
to
ponder
the
complexity
of
it
this
is
also
a
beer
with
great
capability
to
be
paired
with
spicy
asian
food
or
some
sharp
cheeses
cheers
notes
the
champagne
like
carbonation
was
fizzy
liked
it
drinkability
it
was
worth
dropping
10
to
try
about
the
best
per
style
i
have
had
ultimate
thirst
quencher
d
im
not
sure
id
buy
this
offering
again
it
was
mostly
for
eheff
who
apparently
didnt
like
it
not
a
bad
brew
in
my
opinion
just
not
one
id
buy
right
off
the
bat
again
with
that
said
im
glad
i
got
the
chance
to
try
it
as
it
had
been
hyped
by
a
coworker
its
an
interesting
style
and
one
worthy
of
exploring
the
verdict
is
out
on
whether
i
actually
like
it
i
appreciate
its
taste
and
complexity
of
flavors
but
im
still
not
100
sure
about
it
the
body
is
creamy
and
full
which
is
fairly
odd
for
the
style
but
it
still
has
that
crisp
dry
acidity
with
a
tart
finish
very
good
quite
drinkable
given
both
the
style
and
abv
i
would
highly
recommend
it
to
anybody
looking
to
get
their
feet
wet
with
the
often
overwhelming
gueuze
style
another
exceptional
gueuze
from
boon
this
being
the
most
complex
that
ive
had
from
them
so
far
it
is
aggressive
and
harsh
yet
light
and
so
drinkable
this
is
one
ill
definatly
chase
down
again
drinkability
crisp
and
refreshing
very
drinkable
despite
or
perhaps
because
of
the
sourness
poured
out
a
light
straw
color
with
a
thin
off
white
head
and
no
lacing
on
the
inside
of
the
glass
the
nose
was
acidic
with
all
sorts
of
funk
barnyard
smells
wet
horse
stinky
leather
and
acrid
manure
ok
maybe
there
wasnt
manure
why
do
i
like
this
the
taste
was
straight
up
tart
but
not
overly
it
is
also
not
too
sour
as
well
a
bit
more
sedatedmellowed
than
i
was
expecting
but
good
nonetheless
this
stuff
goes
down
very
easy
dthis
was
quite
an
experience
it
really
surprised
me
at
first
definitely
the
driest
sourest
beer
ive
had
to
date
the
taste
became
addicting
and
left
me
wanting
more
and
really
warmed
up
to
me
as
it
warmed
surely
a
brew
that
should
be
not
be
enjoyed
too
cold
not
sure
if
i
was
ready
for
this
but
i
surely
enjoyed
it
and
look
forward
to
trying
others
in
this
style
would
like
to
try
pairing
with
lychee
cheesecake
or
crembrulee
a
less
than
good
drinkability
but
not
bad
by
any
means
sip
and
enjoy
i
was
looking
foward
to
a
high
octane
gueuze
oh
well
very
dry
super
complex
ultra
great
very
drinkable
but
you
may
have
to
settle
in
to
it
a
bit
dangerous
drinkablity
due
to
the
expertlyconceiled
alcohol
the
most
well
rounded
lambic
ive
ever
had
delicious
enough
to
convert
lambicbashers
and
sophisticated
enough
for
the
snobbiest
of
tastes
so
far
in
my
gueuze
adventures
this
one
3
fronteinen
oude
gueuze
and
cantillon
organic
gueuze
are
the
cream
of
the
crop
cant
wait
to
try
more
12
7
ounce
corked
and
bailed
bottle
best
before
26
01
2025
cork
marked
sb
40
im
sold
too
bad
a
gueze
addiction
is
more
expensive
than
a
smack
habit
opinion
oh
my
how
do
i
classify
this
beer
these
beers
are
always
hard
for
me
as
they
are
all
uniquely
different
and
uniquely
outstanding
is
it
possible
for
a
gueuze
to
be
too
clean
this
one
is
squeaky
clean
and
only
has
a
few
flavors
and
aromas
to
pick
out
even
as
the
beer
warms
it
stays
clean
i
like
the
alcoholic
warming
that
you
get
from
this
beer
as
it
is
completely
masked
in
the
flavor
this
is
my
first
beer
of
the
evening
and
i
am
already
getting
happy
regardless
this
is
a
beer
that
i
really
like
and
i
would
absolutely
like
to
drink
it
again
when
finished
i
wondered
how
this
could
be
8
just
doesnt
seem
like
it
blows
my
socks
off
beautiful
glowing
copper
in
color
with
creamy
white
head
smelling
this
beer
i
was
first
hit
with
expected
barnyard
oh
yeah
but
now
i
am
noticing
more
sour
fruits
than
anything
else
taste
is
noticeably
dry
and
tart
carbonation
tingles
the
tongue
this
beer
is
quite
light
very
enjoyable
and
drinkable
for
when
you
are
in
the
mood
for
geuze
taste
is
very
different
from
the
aroma
at
least
in
balance
very
dry
up
front
an
even
balance
of
the
green
apple
fruitiness
the
barnyard
funk
the
light
sweetness
of
the
malt
and
the
puckering
tartness
then
it
finishes
nice
and
dry
again
crisp
clean
and
dry
mouth
exquisite
on
the
tongue
very
nice
every
now
anf
then
you
are
struck
by
a
brew
that
is
simply
subtle
balanced
and
well
crafted
this
is
one
for
me
been
wanting
to
try
this
for
years
and
it
did
not
dissappoint
time
to
get
more
let
me
state
for
the
records
that
i
dont
like
lambics
i
find
them
to
be
tongue
searing
and
stomach
churning
sour
except
this
one
isnt
an
excellent
alternative
to
chardonnay
wine
and
a
good
choice
for
entry
in
to
exploring
the
world
of
lambic
type
sour
beers
this
is
about
the
only
nonsweet
lambic
i
can
recommend
drinkability
not
bad
at
all
for
a
gueuze
but
maybe
a
bit
too
dry
could
also
be
a
bit
more
complex
drinkability

it
was
pushing
the
limit
but
just
did
stay
on
this
side
of
the
sour
danger
zone
it
went
down
well
for
such
a
tart
carbonated
ale
while
i
find
lambics
even
the
hard
ones
quite
drinkable
this
one
is
definitely
on
the
drinkable
side
the
acidity
for
a
lambic
is
not
that
prominent
and
the
seriously
funky
enterobacterial
notes
are
quite
muted
if
not
nonexistent
in
the
taste
this
beer
is
seriously
drinkable
despite
the
8
alcohol
label
on
the
beer
while
i
could
certainly
wish
for
more
complexity
this
is
a
perfectly
drinkable
gueuze
one
which
i
am
happy
to
be
the
new
owner
of
6
bottles
this
is
also
a
big
step
above
the
boon
fruit
lambics
though
i
must
admit
that
oddly
enough
the
last
batch
of
oude
geuze
boon
seemed
a
touch
more
complex
than
this
bottle
given
this
one
sample
size
so
far
i
would
say
that
on
average
this
is
one
of
the
more
complex
boon
products
sour
freaks
will
be
a
little
putoff
by
the
way
that
the
uriney
flavors
and
moldy
notes
dont
take
hold
in
this
beer
maybe
they
will
after
time
seems
like
a
newer
bottle
i
have
here
its
certainly
a
refreshing
change
and
i
dig
it
perfect
example
of
why
boon
is
the
man
would
love
to
see
his
beautiful
restraint
team
up
with
the
russian
river
crew
for
some
spectacular
blending
drinkability
an
acquired
taste
but
quite
enjoyable
overall
great
stuff
indeed
allegedly
the
mariage
parfait
is
solely
comprised
of
a
blend
of
just
three
year
old
lambic
though
i
am
not
really
sure
if
it
ever
gets
to
the
listed
8
abv
or
even
how
it
could
get
to
that
kind
of
strength
being
a
traditional
lambic
nonetheless
this
is
well
worth
the
benjamins
recommended
a
nicely
balanced
and
satisfying
geuze
might
be
a
bit
high
on
the
sour
funk
for
the
uninitiated
very
traditional
and
fruity
but
the
lack
of
body
and
complexity
effect
the
lambic
in
many
ways
still
though
this
is
a
traditional
unsweetened
lambic
which
says
a
lot
and
definately
worth
sampling
there
are
just
so
many
better
examples
of
the
style
notes
even
after
5
years
of
cellaring
the
8
is
easily
detected
its
not
hot
or
solventy
but
i
would
have
assumed
it
would
be
more
subtle
then
what
i
taste
the
body
is
thing
and
very
dry
definitely
an
interesting
beer
not
quite
as
funky
as
a
fresher
gueuze
just
excellent
i
tried
and
tested
a
bottle
of
this
alongside
of
the
regular
oude
geuze
and
candidly
theres
not
a
lot
of
difference
the
smell
is
a
little
more
pungent
the
body
a
little
thicker
but
its
a
tough
call
to
tell
them
apart
and
of
course
its
a
bit
stronger
and
a
lot
more
expensive
having
said
that
its
great

also
noticeable

is
quite

with
again
some
citrus
notes
and
a
quite
powerful
sour
taste
the
acidity
level
is
just
perfect
and
doesnt
unbalance
this
great
beer
i
was
quite
surprise
with
the
high
level
of
abv
for
a
gueuze
but
since
it
hard
to
notice
tastewise
i
didnt
mind
overall
a
great
gueuze
with
good
balance
and
complexity
1995
vintage
sampled
at
the
kulminator
in
antwerp
this
brew
was
a
lovely
golden
colour
with
a
nice
white
head
the
aromas
are
of
barnyard
funk
horse
blanket
junk
stumbling
monk
some
guy
shooting
crunk
a
drunk
skunk
and
a
dirty
monk
the
taste
is
an
excitingly
tart
gueuze
flavor
this
stuff
will
strip
the
enaml
off
of
your
teeth
the
mouthfeel
is
highly
carbonated
and
very
lively
in
the
mouth
the
drinkability
is
classic
overall
impression
this
was
easily
my
favorite
from
the
evening
though
the
oude
geuze
de
cam
and
the
oude
geuze
mort
subite
were
also
near
the
top
of
the
list
its
a
good
geuze
if
you
arent
a
huge
fan
of
overwhelming
lambic
character
to
put
it
diplomatically
simply
awesome
very
stinky
earthy
smell
very
earthy
flavour
very
sour
very
citric
slightly
bitter
and
tart
very
complex
and
a
slight
woody
barrel
flavour
dont
hesitate
if
you
see
this
you
wont
regret
it
i
know
there
are
better
but
it
has
no
meaning
it
is
delicious

such
a
treat
just
textbook
execution
of
what
a

should
smell

taste

i
had
the
chance
to
try
a

last

and
it
was
like
2
different
beers
still
nice
but
not

i
can
not

enough
about
the

with
a
very
smooth
crisp
and
moderately
acidic
mouthfeel
that
is
great
alcohol
is
well
hidden
with
minimal

present
after
the
finish
overall
this
is
an
outstanding
gueuze
style
all
around
awesome
complexity
and
balance
of
fruityfunkyacidic
yeast
oak
and
pale
malt
flavors
and
very
smooth
and
crisp
to
drink
with
the
balanced
acidity
a
highly
enjoyable
offering
serving
type
bottle
probably
the
worst
beerif
you
can
call
it
beer
i
have
ever
had
sour
no
redeeming
palate
taste
i
have
had
more
beers
than
i
could
count
and
even
when
they
do
not
measure
up
they
are
never
a
waste
this
one
was
poured
a
cloudy
orange
with
a
half
finger
frothy
white
head
that
quickly
receded
it
looks
like
most
other
geuzes
ive
sampled
pretty
nice
scents
of
lemon
juice
abundant
sour
yeast
funk
bright
acidity
straw
hay
oak
sour
green
apple
white
grape
low
levels
of
grapefruit
and
indeterminate
citrus
and
a
low
level
of
what
seems
to
be
alcohol
overall
impression
of
aroma
is
of
a
classic
geuze
aroma
profile
with
many
of
the
regular
aromas
on
display
a
bit
funkier
and
sourdominated
compared
to
other
examples
which
hurts
the
balance
with
the
oak
and
fruit
a
bit
dry
in
aroma
overall
since
malt
and
honey
aromas
are
absent
and
fruit
tends
towards
a
sour
variety
still
nice
and
appealing
flavor
begins
highly
sour
with
a
funky
wild
yeast
character
straw
a
bit
of
tangy
wheat
a
light
bitterness
from
the
hops
and
a
bit
of
lemon
juice
middle
continues
to
be
sour
and
acidic
with
lemon
juice
oak
and
sour
yeasty
funk
being
the
principle
flavors
a
mild
hop
bitterness
is
also
present
finish
is
still
sour
and
acidic
and
dry
with
a
very
strong
presence
of
sour
barnyard
yeast
funk
straw
a
moderate
level
of
oak
a
mild
lemon
juice
character
and
light
hop
bitterness
aftertaste
is
tangy
yeast
lemon
juice
very
light
honey
and
wild
funky
yeast
overall
impression
of
taste
is
of
a
highly
sour
geuze
that
is
very
heavy
towards
the
funky
yeasty
lemon
and
oak
flavors
other
fruits
are
absent
as
is
honey
which
hurts
the
overall
flavor
profile
it
is
a
decent
geuze
but
lacks
the
balance
and
depth
of
better
examples
hop
bitterness
is
also
a
bit
more
discernible
than
in
other
examples
though
hop
flavor
is
absent
keeping
to
style
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
bodied
with
light
carbonation
and
a
drying
acidic
feel
overall
impression
of
mouthfeel
is
fairly
true
to
style
for
a
geuze
though
the
carbonation
is
far
to
low
perhaps
due
to
an
older
bottle
overall
this
is
a
decent
geuze
that
is
fairly
refreshing
and
nicely
sour
in
aroma
and
flavor
perhaps
a
bit
too
sour
however
a
sourness
overwhelms
the
flavor
the
aroma
fairs
better
but
could
still
use
a
bit
more
balance
mouthfeel
is
good
overall
though
and
this
isnt
a
bad
geuze
there
are
just
far
better
examples
overall
a
good
gueuze
with
a
darker
body
and
lower
carbonation
than
others
what
sets
this
apart
from
others
in
the
style
is
a
unique
bretty
savory
note
that
appears
in
the
aroma
and
taste
not
bad
but
unique
also
sweeter
and
not
as
refreshing
still
ill
be
buying
this
to
try
again
though
its
not
my
number

a

tending
just
to
the

side
of
sour
per
my
own
scale
the
beer
doesnt
have
too
much
depth
but
thats
not
necessarily
the
point
of
a
sour
in
my
mind
given
that
its
an
import
and
a
sour
id
have
to
consider
cost
but
this
is
a
definite

beer
outstanding

finished
with
a
brett

and
overall
a
great
interpretation
of
the
style
that
id
buy
again
in
a
heartbeat
overall
someone
unfamiliar
with
lambics
will
find
this
too
abrasive
like
if
someone
poured
paint
thinner
into
a
very
tart
shandy
but
lambic
fans
will
love
it
it
hits
all
the
notes
brings
a
bomb
of
sour
flavor
and
comes
in
that
cool
bottle
overall
first
gueze
very
interesting
o
excellent
sour
flavor
is
prominent
true
to
the
style
this
pours
a
cloudy
golden
amber
color
with
a
foamy
head
the
aroma
is
slightly
sweet
and
yeasty
the
taste
is
sweet
with
lots
of
sugar
slightly
tart
and
leaves
a
lingering
bitter
taste
this
is
very
tasty
and
a
decent
lambic
for
the
price
with
a
good
full
texture
this
a
lambic
that
delivers
o
fantastic
gueuze
just
what
i
wanted
just
what
i
dream
of
for
the
most
part
o
big
puckering
notes
on
the
aroma
and
taste
very
good
overall
taste
is
candied
lemon
up
front
like
a
lemonhead
with
some
lemon
rind
and
other
fruits
including
apple
and
grape
there
is
a
funky
base
of
earth
grass
and
oak
but
not
as
much
as
the
smell
would
suggest
there
is
also
a
slightly
metallic
aftertaste
very
sour
the
hanssens
seems
to
contain
a
higher
amount
of
acetic
acid
than
cantillon
or
3f
gueuze
it
has
a
very
vinegary
taste
and
sensation
i
can
feel
in
the
back
of
my
throat
i
felt
the
same
way
about
the
hanssens
oude
kriek
however
the
gueuze
is
more
drinkable
than
the
kriek
there
is
a
cloying
sweetness
which
in
combination
with
the
vinegar
and
the
moderate
prickly
carbonation
made
for
a
beer
that
is
less
drinkable
than
i
was
hoping
i
love
gueuze
and
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
for
your
gueuze
fix
however
both
3f
and
cantillon
are
much
better
o
a
great
geuze
and
well
worth
a
try
o
a
fantastic
gueuze
well
blended
and
well
balanced
a
great
example
of
the
style

o

oude
gueuze
is
one
of
the
most
varying
beers
ive
encountered
ranging
from
absolutely
stellar
to
pretty
good
with
this
particular
bottle
landing
right
in
the
middle
a
great
gueuze
with
fantastic
drinkability
for
a
sour
beer
this
funky
golden
ale
quenches
both
thirst
and
thirst
for
sour
power
this
is
a
bold
sour
beer
one
of
the
spiciest
and
sour
i
had
a
must
for
sour
heads
t
there
isnt
much
carbonation
but
it
doesnt
really
seem
to
be
a
problem
loads
of
funk
and
lemon
acidity
right
away
nice
lingering
tartness
and
funk
throughout
never
really
gets
too
sour
but
this
is
a
pleasant
gueuze
o
its
a
very
sour
beer
i
am
not
a
big
fan
but
it
works
overall
an
okay
gueuze
i
can
think
of
at
least
two
off
the
top
of
my
head
that
are
better
easier
to
get
and
cheaper
and
they
come
in
the
same
singleserve
bottle
so
no
need
to
buy
in
750
ml
bulk
give
me
more
of
that
experimental
cassis
over
this
one
any
day
overall
super
tasty
tart
and
refreshing
one
of
the
sourest
beers
ive
ever
had
and
it
works
to
great
effect
here
kudos
overall
this
beer
is
the
staple
of
what
a
gueuze
should
taste
like
o
a
nice
flavorful
geuze
im
surprised
that
its
took
me
so
long
to
finally
review
it
overall
i
really
dig
this
and
would
love
to
have
more
to
share
d
exceptional
balance
and
boasting
great
flavor
in
contention
for
my
favorite
recommended
color
me
impressed
while
i
do
not
believe
this
is
a
worldbeater
level
gueuze
which
in
all
fairness
is
one
of
the
hardest
leaderboards
to
climb
its
still
pretty
damn
good
and
its
even
more
appealing
due
to
its
relatively
reasonable
pricepoint
and
superb
availability
sometime
to
tide
over
your
gueuze
yearning
after
you
drink
your
last
cantillon
dont
pass
this
one
up
like
i
did
softer
carbonation
and
a
fuller
body
for
a
gueuze
a
very
good
shelf
geuze
that
reminds
me
of
a
less
intense
drie
fonteinen
oude
geuze
its
not
the
most
intensely
flavourful
geuze
like
3f
oude
geuze
nor
is
it
funky
like
cantillon
classic
but
it
is
readily
available
at
a
price
point
that
is
hard
to
argue
with
i
think
i
would
prefer
tilquins
version
at
the
same
price
point
however
if
that
isnt
available
then
this
one
is
the
one
i
would
turn
to
overall
quite
enjoyable
although
the
appearance
was
a
tad
offputting
flavorful
and
fun
but
with
slightly
too
much
sournessother
flavors
could
have
come
out
creating
a
rounder
taste
a
nice
gueuze
but
a
bit
one
dimensional
and
not
quite
dry
and
carbonated
enough
this
was
a
fairly
young
bottle
id
be
really
interested
to
see
what
it
does
with
some
age
this
is
my
perfect
gueuze
the
yeast
profile
in
this
is
beer
great
its
funky
its
like
sheep
and
hay
in
a
bottle
its
smells
like
the
farmland
of
belgium
it
takes
you
there
with
your
nose
and
tongue
its
perfectly
lactic
and
sour
great
light
fruit
flavors
sour
apple
white
grapes
similar
to
a
fine
white
wine
or
champagne
its
a
perfect
palette
cleanser
with
something
rich
beef
tenderloin
hooks
15
year
cheddar
and
this
are
my
deathbed
meal
or
just
great
to
drink
with
anything
anytime
in
excess
if
i
could
mmm
if
not
this
then
giradin
1882
or
boon
marriage
parfait
mmm
a
delicious
and
very
complex
geuze
not
the
best
ive
ever
had
but
certainly
one
of
the
most
interesting
and
complex
it
is
a
well
crafted
beer
the
flavor
fails
to
match
the
well
balanced
complexity
of
its
aroma
but
still
very
good
a
great
bargain
this
one
is
worth
every
penny
overall
just
a
wonderful
brew
this
is
a
style
i
really
look
forward
to
digging
more
into
and
really
growing
to
love
the
complexity
found
with
this
brew
is
absolutely
elite
the
tartness
of
this
beer
is
perfectly
done
this
beer
did
not
take
very
long
to
drink
d
this
hits
all
of
the
right
notes
for
an
outstanding
geueze
but
for
some
reason
i
found
it
lacking
i
think
the
aceticvinegar
sourness
was
just
a
bit
out
of
balance
with
the
rest
of
the
flavors
still
an
outstanding
beer
but
this
vintage
was
not
as
great
as
others
i
have
had
a
delightful
pop
from
the
cork
and
this
poured
out
sunshine
golden
straw
color
light
and
a
bit
cloudy
a
voluptuous
head
of
white
foam
that
settled
to
a
thin
cap
and
collar
and
champagne
effervescence
its
heaven
to
look
at
the
nose
is
strong
and
delicious
with
yeast
brett
funk
barnyard
and
hay
musty
wood
a
bit
of
vinegar
and
sweet
hint
of
white
grape
and
citrus
taste
is
mouth
watering
juicy
and
sour
lemon
plenty
of
earthy
funk
sour
with
some
pear
and
green
apple
malt
is
light
grain
its
simplicity
on
the
palate
and
each
sip
has
you
asking
for
more
nice
dry
finish
and
a
little
oak
and
vanilla
in
the
aftertaste
this
was
a
wild
and
refreshing
gueuze
othis
is
a
great
gueuze
the
flavors
are
sweeter
and
less
funky
than
some
beers
of
this
style
and
the
feel
is
softer
and
more
robust
all
of
which
combine
to
make
this
beer
a
bit
less
harshfeeling
than
some
other
gueuze
which
helps
the
drinkability
that
being
said
this
beer
still
has
complexity
and
tartness
that
make
this
style
so
enjoyable
o
sour
beers
are
all
supposed
to
taste
the
same
right
i
mean
shouldnt
that
intense
lactic
acidity
just
push
everything
to
the
same
end
as
it
stands
this
is
the
belgian
style
in
which
ive
seen
the
most
variation
with
tastes
from
heavy
to
crisp
bitter
to
sweet
and
fruity
to
herbal
there
seems
to
be
an
array
of
possibilities
here
all
i
can
hope
is
that
they
all
turn
out
as
good
as
this
a
nice
gueuze
but
certainly
not
the
best
one
out
there
and
i
think
this
is
probably
a
little
overrated
here
on
ba
it
pours
a
faded
orange
color
well
cloudy
and
not
holding
onto
much
of
its
bubbly
white
head
the
nose
is
sour
and
vinegar
forward
with
some
strawlike
malt
and
a
spunky
yeast
character
the
acidic
sour
element
is
the
strongest
part
of
the
flavor
as
it
should
be
in
a
good
gueuze
but
i
also
pick
up
some
light
fruit
here
tart
berries
or
something
which
gives
the
beer
a
little
sweetness
and
a
little
weight
beyond
its
middle
of
the
road
malt
bill
the
finish
is
very
acidic
now
more
vinegar
than
conventional
sour
which
clashes
with
the
sweetness
not
as
effervescently
carbonated
as
i
like
for
the
style
but
satisfying
enough
also
a
little
thicker
than
some
but
that
doesnt
bother
me
with
all
the
complexity
here
overall
this
is
a
very
well
made
version
of
the
style
but
it
lacks
some
of
the
memorable
features
of
the
best
ones
it
also
drags
slightly
in
feel
which
is
supposed
to
be
so
bright
here
probably
not
worth
the
money
they
charge
for
this
but
a
must
have
obviously
for
any
gueuzeheads
overall
one
of
the
best
sours
ive
ever
had
i
slightly
prefer
drie
fonteinen
but
this
one
is
right
up
there
the
beer
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
white
head
that
fades
quickly
without
lacing
the
nose
is
a
tad
skunky
at
first
but
mellows
out
and
becomes
a
slightly
sweet
funky
tartly
gueuzey
the
taste
is
quite
potent
with
great
grain
yeast
bacteria
and
a
touch
of
sweetness
is
definitely
a
gueuze
that
packs
it
in
flavor
and
exceeds
expectations
the
mouthfeel
is
sweet
and
sour
upfront
with
a
lingering
dryness
thats
slowly
washed
away
by
my
quickly
responding
saliva
i
wouldnt
want
tooth
decay
with
all
this
acidity
this
is
a
great
beer
with
excellent
price
and
availability
the
body
is
bone
dry
allowing
the
sourness
to
come
out
some
yeast
into
the
finish
cuts
the
finish
some
off
yeast
notes
linger
into
the
finish
would
have
liked
a
bit
more
carbonation
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
love
the
big
sour
notes
o
i
like
it
a
little
more
apple
cider
than
i
really
like
but
certainly
enjoyable
tasty
sour
a
solid
gueze
maybe
not
as
good
as
3fon
or
cantillion
but
pretty
close
buy
this
if
you
can
i
would
really
like
to
drink
this
beer
again
o
there
is
a
decent
amount
of
complexity
to
the
smell
and
the
taste
of
this
beer
that
only
increases
as
the
beer
warms
up
this
beer
is
not
too
sour
for
the
style
so
is
pretty
approachable
even
for
folks
new
to
the
style
just
enough
funkiness
to
keep
it
interesting
relatively
easy
to
drink
especially
for
the
style
o
easydrinking
beer
great
gueuze
specimen
recommended
overall
this
is
a
damn
fine
geuze
i
would
get
it
more
often
but
it
is
slightly
more
expensive
than
tilquin
or
even
3
fontenine
this
will
be
a
nice
treat
every
now
and
then
i
could
drink
this
every
day
what
a
good
experience
overall
very
good
but
not
one
of
the
best
gueuzes
i
have
had
overall
a
very
nice
geuze
for
those
who
like
the
style
o
a
very
nice
gueuze
the
flavors
and
especially
the
aroma
are
really
great
this
is
probably
one
of
the
better
readilyavailable
gueuzes
that
we
get
here
in
the
us
m
light
and
airy
my
first
of
this
style
so
i
am
not
sure
what
they
are
supposed
to
be
like
however
i
enjoyed
this
goes
good
with
good
music
recommend
saxophonist
mark
whitecage
with
this
brew
odelicious
gueze
with
great
flavor
and
balance
perfect
for
a
nice
summer
evening
overall
a
very
fine
gueuze
really
enjoying
this
one
all
in
all
stop
reading
this
review
go
out
and
purchase
this
beer
o
a
little
pricey
but
a
nice
gueuze
for
sure
nice
blend

would
drink
it
again
drinkability

its
a
delicious

classic
gueuze
made
to
be
highly
drinkable
and
quenching
yet
still
offering
depth
of

your

for

by
far
the
funkiest
aroma
i
have
ever
smelled
from
a
beer
bright
tangy
sourness
with
a
serious
musky
funk
the
acidity
almost
burns
the
throat
this
was
a
joy
to
drink
o
such
a
delicious
sour
beer
so
seemingly
simple
and
yet
there
is
a
beautiful
complexity
underneath
a
solid
gueuze
but
could
be
a
touch
more
sour
overall
pretty
good
decently
light
but
it
still
has
some
good
flavors
and
a
good
fruitiness
hanssens
oude
gueuze
may
not
be
the
funkiest
or
most
complex
gueuze
on
the
market
but
it
is
still
an
enjoyable
treat
this
is
an
ideal
beer
to
enjoy
on
a
hot
summer
night
o
i
am
not
very
well
versed
in
the
style
in
fact
i
believe
this
is
only
my
second
gueuze
the
other
one
being
girardin
1882
but
look
out
wallet
i
think
ive
found
something
here
this
could
be
the
start
of
a
new
obsession
i
love
the
huge
tartsour
characteristics
which
is
what
i
also
look
for
in
saisons
and
wild
ales
with
only
having
tried
a
couple
the
jury
is
still
out
but
if
this
beer
is
representative
of
gueuzes
then
they
could
quickly
become
one
of
my
favorite
styles
mouthfeel
is
dry
and
smooth
overall
i
think
its
pretty
good
i
like
the
lindemans
cuvee
rene
better
though
its
tasty
not
all
that
complex
as
the
brettanomyces
doesnt
hold
up
to
the
sourness
here
but
tasty
id
never
turn
down
a
bottle
of
this
gueuze
but
i
prefer
a
funkier
beer
o
a
solid
gueuze
that
i
will
pick
up
again
very
sour
o
this
was
a
good
geuze
but
not
as
good
as
some
of
the
better
sours
ive
had
it
had
a
nice
amount
of
sour
funk
and
tart
lemony
flavor
with
a
good
feel
not
nearly
as
good
as
the
beatification
that
i
had
last
night
though
overall
not
a
bad
beer
that
i
recommend
picking
out
if
you
like
geuzes
not
bad
for
the
price
availability
enjoyable
overall
i
was
not
all
the
impressed
with
my
first
gueuze
there
was
just
not
complexity
for
a
beer
that
has
been
aging
for
so
long
750
ml
bottle
no
date
but
i
suspect
it
was
bottled
fairly
recently
pours
a
slightly
hazy
golden
amber
with
a
small
white
head
that
has
decent
retention
and
leaves
close
to
no
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
has
a
strong
minerally
note
a
slight
sulfur
note
and
some
light
lemon
the
initial
taste
has
some
sweetness
with
lemon
mineral
brett
and
some
light
apple
the
finish
is
tart
with
some
brett
medium
body
low
carbonation
this
was
drank
with
3f
oude
geuze
and
cantillon
classic
geuze
this
was
the
worst
of
the
three
but
was
still
enjoyable
it
isnt
quite
as
complex
and
has
a
bit
more
sweetness
overall
most
of
time
i
like
my
sour
beers
with
fruit
but
i
prefer
this
beer
over
hanssens
oude
kriek
this
beer
is
so
solid
it
does
not
need
the
fruit
which
i
really
enjoy
in
sour
beers
this
is
a
really
elegant
gueuze
not
to
mention
its
a
great
shelf
beer
i
would
even
put
this
on
the
same
level
as
drie
fonteinen
oude
gueuze
beer
is
mediumbodied
with
moderately
high
carbonation
that
foams
this
up
quickly
on
the
palate
resultant
mouthfeel
very
quickly
becomes
smooth
and
somewhat
creamy
close
is
dry
with
a
slight
stickiness
around
the
edges
of
the
lips
and
a
lingering
acid
burn
in
the
throat
that
can
actually
be
a
bit
unpleasant
i
thought
this
was
a
decent
gueuze
but
somewhat
lacking
in
the
funkbarnyard
area
the
sourness
is
quite
puckering
but
i
would
have
liked
more
funk
i
would
drink
it
again
though
o
the
best
of
the
bunch
for
sure
where
the
kriek
and
raspberry
fail
this
one
excels
tone
down
the
overly
aggressive
sourness
and
this
one
could
be
great
as
it
stands
now
a
solid
gueuze
that
is
definitely
worth
the
lower
than
average
price
tag
pours
a
murky
honey
orange
with
a
12
inch
foamy
offwhite
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
there
is
a
small
amount
of
sediment
that
is
floating
around
in
the
glass
after
the
pour
small
chunks
of
lace
stick
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
extremely
tart
sour
and
funky
with
lots
of
wild
earthy
and
woody
aromas
taste
is
much
like
the
smell
with
some
fruity
flavors
that
i
cant
quite
put
my
finger
on
there
is
definitely
a
lemonlike
presence
i
am
picking
up
there
is
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
the
best
hanssens
beer
i
have
had
so
far
and
also
the
first
one
to
have
noticeable
carbonation
flavour
tart
very
tart
reminds
me
quite
a
bit
of
crab
apples
with
such
a
little
head
as
was
present
could
be
mistaken
for
a
tart
cider
rather
than
a
beer
there
is
no
discernible
flavor
of
hops
and
little
of
malt
the
lambic
nature
shines
through
without
subtlety
certainly
a
onebottle
and
done
variety
or
were
one
open
to
suggestions
a
superior
digestif
o
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
and
it
has
always
been
one
of
my
goto
gueuze
that
i
can
always
find
at
a
decent
price
o
after
reviewing
3f
oude
geuze
a
couple
days
ago
this
seems
to
be
on
the
opposite
end
of
the
spectrum
very
sour
and
not
terribly
complex
certainly
not
bad
but
not
great
this
is
a
fine
gueuze
that
is
easy
to
drink
without
a
ton
of
funk
or
sourness
to
overwhelm
solid
on
all
fronts
quite
an
excellent
beer
though
i
prefer
the
more
funkified
takes
on
this
style
definitely
recommend
remarkable
clarity
with
a
light
orange
color
thin
white
head
around
rim
on
glass
decent
carbonation
going
smells
softer
than
other
examples
of
oude
gueuze
ive
had
very
floral
with
hints
of
fruit
from
yeast
and
bacteria
slight
grass
or
hay
quality
as
well
very
pleasant
and
appealing
smell
taste
and
mouthfeels
is
quite
mild
for
hanssens
standards
not
to
downplay
it
i
really
like
it
solid
wild
microbe
character
oakiness
blends
in
nicely
light
bitterness
is
suiting
tart
thin
body
from
thorough
fermentation
lingering
acidity
flavors
really
change
as
i
sip
on
as
my
palates
adjusts
eventually
some
wheat
flavors
stand
out
highly
drinkable
sour
beer
o
just
a
great
beer
overall
great
flavor
profile
overall
not
the
most
complex
gueuze
out
there
but
man
did
it
hit
the
spot
after
a
long
hot
day
i
am
hard
pressed
to
think
of
a
beer
that
i
have
had
that
has
been
more
satisfying
than
this
delicious
and
refreshing
i
will
have
to
get
another
bottle
or
two
o
i
did
not
really
enjoy
my
first
sour
experience
i
am
pretty
disappointed
in
this
overall
a
great
geuze
sour
but
not
over
the
top
and
incredibly
complex
i
love
this
beer

o
a
pretty
decent
gueuze
though
a
bit
on
the
acetic
side
for
me
i
think
i
would
prefer
it
out
of
the
bottle
with
carbonation
though
at
least
thats
what
happened
with
me
i
thought
it
was
pretty
good
pours
a
deep
orange
color
with
a
nice
one
finger
off
white
head
the
head
lasts
forever
on
this
beer
very
hazy
and
murky
in
appearance
the
nose
is
flippin
amazing
so
much
funk
its
ridiculously
good
funk
apple
peach
and
quite
a
bit
of
acidity
out
front
here
wow
taste
is
very
sharp
with
lots
of
acidity
tartness
funk
and
bruised
fruit
big
time
peach
in
the
taste
feel
is
very
tart
and
acidic
with
great
carbonation
and
a
tartdry
finish
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
perfect
for
sharing
i
will
definitely
buy
this
again
cheers
very
solid
gueuze
clean
flavors
and
distinct
sourness
left
my
mouth
puckering
and
dry
overall
i
wonder
if
i
just
got
this
one
at
a
weird
time
in
its
life
no
bottling
data
so
i
dont
know
sort
of
sharp
and
not
integrated
like
some
of
the
better
ones
gets
your
sour
fix
though
o
the
only
thing
that
takes
away
from
this
brew
is
the
odd
burnt
characteristic
not
my
favorite
belgian
sour
by
a
mile
but
its
highly
available
ergo
high
five
its
just
fine
just
not
even
sniffin
close
to
the
cantillon
gueuze
overall
its
a
gueuze
so
its
still
good
stuff
not
the
best
but
as
its
one
of
the
only
lambics
available
to
me
im
going
to
drink
it
this
beer
is
a
bright
golden
color
no
head
at
all
cant
see
any
carbonation
in
the
glass
aroma
is
extremely
funky
with
some
sour
acetic
tartness
lemon
rind
and
cobwebs
the
taste
is
nice
and
funky
with
a
great
balance
of
vinegar
sour
and
acetic
sour
lemons
and
apples
and
funk
dominate
the
taste
which
is
fine
with
me
very
light
slightly
undercarbonated
but
otherwise
great
overall
this
is
a
damn
good
example
of
the
style
love
this
beer
i
opened
up
my
bottle
of
hanssenns
oude
gueuze
a
few
months
ago
to
share
with
friends
and
never
really
got
around
to
reviewing
it
what
i
have
been
doing
in
the
mean
time
is
hunting
down
a
local
store
where
i
can
get
another
750ml
bottle
as
far
as
gueuzes
go
this
is
my
favorite
the
flavors
are
just
so
complex
and
mouth
puckering
and
the
smell
is
really
like
no
other
type
of
beer
as
far
as
price
goes
it
more
expensive
than
something
like
a
lindemans
cuvee
renee
but
the
quality
is
just
so
much
much
better
and
id
much
rather
spend
the
extra
67
for
this
so
far
this
is
my
favorite
gueuze
but
im
constantly
on
the
hunt
for
more
o
overall
a
deliciously
moretartthannormal
kind
of
gueuze
what
it
lacks
in
complexity
it
makes
up
for
in
boldness
and
authenticity
really
glad
i
picked
this
up
drinkability
and
overall
impression
this
is
definitely
a
sipping
beer
not
because
of
the
abv
but
because
more
that
a
sip
at
once
makes
one
feel
that
the
flavors
may
be
overwhelming
this
is
a
one
glass
a
night
beer
because
of
the
intensity
of
flavors
my
overall
impression
is
that
this
is
definitely
a
world
class
beer
with
lots
of
complexity
in
the
flavor
and
aroma
and
that
rivals
any
of
the
best
gueuze
ive
tried
to
date
ill
definitely
be
having
more
of
it
o
a
great
lambic
funky
and
vinegary
love
its
subtle
grape
tartness
and
honey
sweet
backbone
will
probably
drink
again
overall
this
is
really
impressive
the
kriek
on
firkin
scared
me
away
for
a
while
but
this
is
a
good
gueuze
o
great
stuff
nuff
said
overall
ive
passed
over
this
at
the
store
because
of
knowing
this
brand
normally
is
not
the
best
i
will
pick
a
couple
up
now
to
age
a
really
tasty
gueuze
id
be
happy
to
drink
again
any
day
worthwhile
always
overall
not
a
cantillon
or
3f
but
definitely
a
solid
substitute
lots
of
complexity
in
the
aroma
and
flavor
definitely
scratched
my
sour
itch
i
recommend
you
give
it
a
shot
flavor
offers
a
nice
and
lingering
fruity
tartness
crisp
and
with
a
long
finish
medium
body
and
with
a
light
but
balanced
carbonation
not
bad
but
not
great
yet
this
brew
easily
beats
out
oude
beersel
and
doesjel
for
the
crown
tonight
the
aroma
is
amazing
citrus
sourness
tartness
and
tons
of
earthy
tones
there
is
funk
here
too
the
waves
of
aroma
foretell
complexity
and
invite
the
drinker
in
it
evolves
into
a
little
more
cellar
funk
as
it
warms
leather
cherry
cellar
and
lemon
all
explosively
mix
to
produce
funky
goodness
on
the
palate
the
intensity
of
this
brew
would
shock
even
the
most
lethargic
palate
to
life
fruit
tart
and
sour
again
and
again
the
acidity
cleanses
the
palate
and
leaves
it
alive
begging
for
more
sour
cherry
and
green
apple
mix
with
funky
undertones
to
produce
a
really
impressive
beer
the
palate
is
dry
and
refreshed
there
is
lots
of
complexity
and
depth
here
a
wondrous
thing
o
it
was
pleasant
but
not
on
the
same
level
of
other
gueuze
i
had
in
the
past
i
really
think
the
age
might
have
been
the
problem
here
even
though
i
know
most
gueuze
age
well
but
maybe
not
in
the
cask
a
more
fruity
and
tart
gueuze
with
highlights
of
green
apple
some
interesting
funk
on
the
tongue
a
solid
gueuze
its
sharp
acidic
flavors
make
it
a
good
candidate
to
replace
cantillon
classic
gueuze
in
this
cantillon
drought
we
are
having
right
now
o
damn
thats
good
if
only
the
appearance
was
better
i
really
enjoyed
this
and
could
drink
it
any
day
of
the
week
a
minimal
white
head
upon
pouring
that
dissipates
quickly
a
deep
golden
color
with
the
slightest
haze
no
bubble
activity
but
still
inviting
a
strong
aroma
of
fruit
and
funk
the
flavor
follows
with
an
intense
tart
and
sour
kick
it
hits
hard
and
lingers
nicely
the
carbonation
was
quite
low
and
it
had
a
silky
smooth
feel
this
is
a
very
interesting
beer
with
a
lot
of
character
and
a
burst
of
flavor
o
this
was
the
first
gueuze
that
really
hit
me
hard
and
wow
did
i
like
it
its
amazing
how
tart
it
is
allow
the
beer
to
warm
a
bit
to
get
a
dryer
funkier
taste
that
is
a
bit
more
balanced
than
when
its
cold
overall
this
beer
was
very
very
cool
i
love
pinot
noir
so
this
beer
in
some
weird
way
kind
of
reminded
me
of
that
it
was
the
stunning
and
super
foodfriendly
acidity
and
bright
cherry
aroma
really
awesome
but
something
that
requires
food
and
would
be
best
on
a
special
occasion
this
one
grips
the
tongue
and
palate
grabs
hold
delivers
what
is
an
unusual
deliciousness
a
long
and
quite
refreshing
finish
and
a
flavor
experience
not
found
anywhere
else
in
the
world
of
beer
drinking
this
beer
it
really
feels
to
be
on
the
farm
d
pretty
solid
gueuze
here
it
has
a
unique
character
to
it
with
a
bit
of
vinegar
in
it
it
is
sour
but
not
as
sour
as
others
i
have
tried
think
cantillon
or
3f
definitely
worth
a
shot
though
especially
to
give
a
new
perspective
on
the
style
overall
despite
the
unique
flavor
and
aroma
the
mouthfeel
really
detracts
from
the
beer
a
lot
of
liveliness
is
lost
in
the
long
run
and
really
makes
drinking
the
beer
less
enjoyable
still
its
a
solid
take
on
the
style
and
definitely
worth
trying
overall
with
cask
like
and
feel
and
total
lambic
goodness
this
is
one
gueze
that
feels
like
drinking
some
really
good
red
wine
vinegar
this
one
is
real
powerful
d
give
me
more
more
i
say
a
fantastic
brew
start
to
finish
and
my
favorite
sour
to
date
3
hanssens
overall
on
of
my
favorite
lambics
available
and
if
it
werent
so
expensive
i
would
drink
it
regularly
25oz
corked
and
caged
opens
with
a
fierce
pop
pours
a
pale
golden
color
with
a
good
deal
of
white
foam
lace
is
left
down
the
glass
aroma
is
musty
funky
barnyard
like
and
a
little
sour
smelling
in
the
taste
a
very
nice
sour
wild
yeast
flavor
biting
lemon
peel
sharp
acidity
and
a
lingering
sour
finish
leaving
a
dry
pucker
full
citrusy
lactic
sour
some
oaky
tannins
are
present
too
making
for
a
very
complex
gueuze
medium
to
light
bodied
feel
semi
dry
overall
drinking
this
beer
is
an
experience
not
to
be
missed
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
othis
is
what
i
think
of
when
i
crave
a
gueuze
a
great
example
of
the
style
that
is
available
pretty
much
all
the
time
o
this
is
a
perfect
example
of
the
style
i
think
although
this
is
beer
is
rather
young
purchased
last
week
its
still
a
very
tasty
and
refreshing
beer
i
think
i
will
pick
up
a
few
more
and
age
them
and
open
one
up
every
year
till
they
are
all
gone
at
10
a
pop
i
can
afford
to
do
that
o
this
is
a
very
acidic
and
intense
gueze
cantillon
and
drie
fonteinen
both
bring
the
funk
but
they
do
so
in
a
much
classier
and
elegant
way
perhaps
its
due
to
its
freshness
but
this
is
extremely
tart
and
acidic
at
this
point
load
of
sour
apple
and
lemons
im
sure
with
some
more
age
it
smooths
out
a
bit
into
something
that
can
compete
with
the
big
guys
a
fantastic
beer
incredibly
refreshing
overall
and
just
a
superb
example
of
the
style
pours
golden
orange
with
a
super
small
white
head
that
doesnt
stick
around
long
has
kind
of
a
sulfer
smell
up
front
with
a
small
amount
of
earthy
funk
coming
through
taste
is
sour
but
not
overwhelming
silght
fruit
and
funk
coming
in
the
aftertaste
mouthfeel
and
carbonation
are
pretty
spot
on
for
the
style
overall
a
good
beer
for
the
price
but
no
cantillon
o
delicious
and
refreshing
perfect
for
a
summer
day
on
the
back
porch
i
could
drink
several
of
these
and
still
not
get
tired
of
the
sour
attack
and
the
complexity
behind
it
overall
never
has
something
this
puckering
and
sour
before
its
like
biting
into
a
lemon
o
one
of
the
best
gueuzes
out
there
period
overall
this
was
an
awesome
beer
and
i
hope
to
score
some
soon
i
know
it
is
usually
cheap
but
its
not
seen
around
ohio
all
that
often
the
aroma
was
strong
pungent
and
very
sour
ahh
the
lovely
aroma
of
brett
in
full
force
here
pungent
aromas
of
grapes
just
all
over
this
one
a
nice
fruity
vibe
as
it
warms
with
hints
of
peaches
and
apples
light
fruit
in
general
were
all
lying
deep
underneath
however
the
real
story
was
the
gorgeous
amounts
of
sour
notes
that
were
all
over
this
one
really
quite
beautiful
the
flavor
followed
along
perfectly
with
a
light
airy
body
this
was
an
ideal
beer
for
the
evening
o
definitely
good
only
thing
that
lacked
for
me
was
carbonation
but
that
could
have
been
my
glassware
choice
dont
normally
see
this
around
the
stores
i
frequent
so
if
i
had
a
chance
to
purchase
again
i
definitely
would
o
very
impressed
with
this
one
for
10
bucks
this
is
a
wonderful
gueuze
to
have
every
so
often
and
ill
be
sure
to
grab
some
more
overall
this
was
my
favorite
of
a
number
of
excellent
beers
last
night
i
really
wanted
another
glass
but
i
also
wanted
to
try
other
things
i
plan
to
crack
a
bottle
of
this
in
the
cellar
for
comparison
an
extremely
good
gueuze
but
the
very
high
acidity
makes
this
one
an
aggressive
gueuze
im
really
glad
i
finally
got
to
try
this
and
for
16
99
a
bottle
i
think
this
is
a
fair
deal
especially
when
compared
to
its
cantillon
and
drie
fonteinen
counterparts
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
and
sour
gueuze
nice
dry
finish
quite
enjoyable
o
a
good
offering
vinegar
funk
and
fruit
dominate
o
very
tart
this
is
helping
me
to
like
gueuzes
more
d
did
i
mention
this
is
sour
awesome
stuff
not
bad
for
my
first
dabble
into
gueuze
style
beers
if
most
of
them
are
like
these
i
cant
wait
to
try
another
just
thinking
of
this
makes
my
mouth
feel
like
i
ate
a
bunch
of
sour
patch
kids
candies
those
with
a
weak
tolerance
to
very
sour
and
active
profiled
beers
you
are
being
warned
what
more
can
be
said
about
these
beers
timetested
and
in
my
opinion
one
of
the
best
styles
of
beer
on
the
planet
good
stuff
s
a
blend
of
wet
hay
and
barnyard
the
palate
opens
with
a
surprising
vinegar
bite
bright
fruity
and
acidity
with
wet
hay
wet
dog
and
a
moderate
lactic
juicy
character
a
little
too
intense
with
a
bit
more
acetic
char
than
id
like
and
more
acetic
character
than
most
gueuzes
should
and
do
have
decent
medium
light
in
body
mildly
carbonated
with
a
vinegary
oaky
finish
this
was
a
rare
treat
albeit
not
the
experience
i
was
hoping
for
o
i
think
this
is
one
beer
that
doesnt
benefit
from
being
on
cask
the
sour
character
is
to
sharp
in
the
aftertaste
an
the
alcohol
burn
on
enhances
that
there
is
no
a
lot
of
depth
of
flavors
but
the
cheese
rind
brett
notes
are
really
pronounced
overall
impression
gueuze
wow
what
a
treat
i
dont
care
how
much
this
one
costs
im
looking
for
this
one
high
and
low
such
a
great
sour
it
reminds
of
my
first
gueuze
with
my
cousin
mark
but
much
much
better
and
now
i
can
really
appreciate
this
style
while
it
is
tougher
to
drink
because
of
the
goatybarnyard
tastes
it
is
enjoyed
sip
by
sip
would
love
to
push
someone
onto
this
style
but
may
be
tough
for
some
to
understand
how
this
could
actually
be
a
beer
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
especially
out
on
the
deck
on
a
summer
day
refreshing
and
has
a
nice
balance
truly
a
gueuze
for
connoisseurs
and
probably
one
of
my
favorite
sours
bottle
poured
into
a
large
tulip
this
is
an
extremely
fizzy
and
cloudy
golden
orange
liquid
smell
is
full
of
blue
cheeselike
funkiness
with
lots
of
lemon
and
sour
citrus
taste
is
bitingly
sour
and
tart
with
strong
astringent
lemon
flavors
very
tasty
and
drinkable
but
maybe
not
the
most
intense
gueuze
ive
tried
still
very
good
bottle
opens
with
a
nice
little
pop
and
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
clear
medium
amber
orange
color
with
a
white
collared
head
lemon
grape
slight
funk
in
the
aroma
starts
with
a
white
wine
grape
sweetness
that
then
transitions
to
a
lemon
zest
like
note
building
sourness
ends
wtih
a
slightly
funky
finish
light
mouthfeel
nice
carbonation
overall
decent
but
not
sure
it
is
worth
the
price
o
well
its
super
interesting
and
wild
as
all
get
out
but
so
damn
funky
and
rotty
that
you
lose
some
of
the
subtle
complexity
of
the
bottled
version
i
thought
this
one
would
go
down
easier
i
stepped
myself
up
and
was
ready
for
this
after
having
a
berliner
weisse
to
start
off
the
day
then
a
lambic
i
thought
i
was
ready
to
tackle
this
one
but
it
left
me
humbled
and
reaching
for
water
to
quench
my
thirst
i
had
this
brew
from
a
bottle
before
and
this
cask
experience
was
a
completely
new
beast
color
me
impressed
but
at
the
same
time
quite
confused
it
could
have
benefited
a
bit
from
even
a
slight
amount
of
carbonation
but
that
was
completely
absent
regardless
not
bad
and
worth
a
try
pours
a
clean
and
clear
near
headless
golden
oranage
one
of
the
darker
tints
ive
seen
from
the
style
scent
is
musty
baryard
damp
wood
and
muddy
earth
forward
sour
notes
and
a
suprisingly
bold
fresh
grainmalt
presence
taste
is
earthy
without
being
overly
funky
muddy
earth
and
damp
wood
present
in
quantity
lightly
sour
and
puckering
at
serving
temperature
cask
remember
and
stronger
as
it
approached
full
room
temp
really
becomes
a
puckering
being
later
on
the
grain
profile
is
heavier
then
many
in
the
style
limited
cask
carbonation
here
beer
comes
across
as
medium
and
the
sourness
lingers
on
the
palate
a
nice
find
in
cask
maybe
not
my
prefered
method
to
serve
the
style
but
a
good
beer
overall
this
beer
flattened
me
on
the
nose
and
backed
off
just
enough
to
be
a
bit
better
than
good
in
the
mouth
really
a
remarkable
sourness
lingering
here
earlier
tonight
i
had
a
kuhnhenn
4d
and
i
cant
imagine
two
brews
more
different
i
guess
that
illustrates
how
versatile
these
few
ingredients
can
be
o
i
have
to
admit
it
has
become
difficult
to
guzzle
the
second
half
of
this
pint
due
to
the
oftmentioned
sourness
and
the
fact
that
i
just
had
a
few
glasses
of
lp
kriek
it
is
a
very
delicious
brew
however
the
appearance
and
mouthfeel
are
just
okay
but
this
beer
really
excels
in
terms
of
aroma
and
flavor
smells
fantastic
tastes
fantastic
what
more
can
you
ask
for
almost
a
drain
pour
but
i
did
finish
it
the
flavors
werent
bad
just
not
ample
enough
for
me
od
what
i
consider
a
great
gueuze
really
refreshing
and
a
nice
fruity
taste
the
sourness
is
there
to
punch
as
well
o
this
has
great
drinkability
it
is
crisp
smooth
and
it
tastes
awesome
overall
i
thought
this
was
an
awesome
beer
it
is
my
first
gueuze
but
i
am
looking
forward
to
having
many
more
i
recommend
giving
this
a
shot
i
would
buy
it
again
overall
im
not
sure
that
i
prefer
styles
such
as
this
out
of
a
cask
as
much
as
i
would
out
of
the
bottle
but
ill
sure
keep
trying
to
see
whether
i
can
pin
that
opinion
down
or
not
a
solid
beer
thats
worth
a
shot
750ml
bottle
poured
into
a
great
lakes
snifter
nice
light
golden
color
with
minimal
offwhite
head
looks
like
a
gueuze
smells
very
funky
and
a
musky
but
in
a
very
good
way
very
tart
and
sour
in
the
nose
taste
is
not
very
sour
or
tart
and
that
is
a
bit
disappointing
but
the
flavor
is
great
funky
with
bits
of
horseblanket
no
i
do
not
use
this
term
legitimately
classic
gueuze
in
flavor
and
i
am
certainly
enjoying
it
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thick
with
lower
carbonation
recommended
pours
a
very
hazy
goldenorange
color
with
a
very
small
white
head
that
diminishes
quickly
scent
is
dear
god
thats
some
funk
right
there
i
could
smell
it
the
second
i
popped
the
cork
when
nose
i
held
up
to
glass
i
get
a
ton
of
lemon
and
zesty
aromas
with
some
heavy
oak
and
faint
hoppiness
this
is
a
great
smelling
beer
taste
is
just
as
great
at
first
i
get
tart
lemon
flavors
that
are
quickly
followed
by
hops
and
oak
some
lovely
oak
and
peach
flavors
in
this
beer
nice
funky
aftertaste
damn
tasty
beer
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
dry
not
the
most
dry
gueuze
ive
head
but
nicely
dry
and
crisp
drinkability
is
high
overall
this
is
an
awesome
beer
i
need
to
definitely
go
pick
some
more
of
this
up
to
age
on
a
side
note
this
beer
reminds
me
of
a
much
less
hoppy
le
terrior
from
new
belgium
the
beer
is
hazy
and
light
orange
hued
with
an
inch
of
white
head
that
fades
to
nothing
after
a
few
moments
the
aroma
is
of
authentic
belgian
gueuze
funk
straw
farmyard
light
citrus
the
taste
is
very
pleasant
with
a
subtle
biting
sharpness
in
the
finish
the
acetic
feel
in
the
back
end
is
more
prominent
here
than
in
some
of
my
favorite
gueuzes
overall
a
solid
example
of
the
style
and
definitely
worth
a
try
this
beer
was
my
official
public
introduction
to
old
gueuze
in
belgium
much
to
the
surprise
of
my
local
ownerbartender
it
looked
fantastic
poured
out
of
an
old
bottle
with
mold
on
the
label
i
knew
it
was
going
to
be
an
experience
the
smell
was
citris
and
age
and
once
i
poured
it
into
my
mouth
the
first
thing
i
said
when
i
slammed
down
the
glass
on
the
split
wood
bar
was
holy
sht
which
i
can
imagine
even
the
belgians
know
since
all
their
television
shows
have
english
subtitles
the
sourness
hits
you
like
a
truck
and
its
all
uphill
from
there
nice
citrus
and
a
cloying
not
even
sure
i
know
what
that
term
means
feeling
that
is
unique
not
my
particular
cup
of
tea
but
a
great
experience
ill
remember
forever
try
it
d
sets
the
standard
for
gueuze
had
no
idea
that
they
offered
this
on
cask
until
a
bartender
told
me
about
it
a
week
prior
to
tapping
awesome
stuff
definitely
recommended
o
this
is
one
of
the
best
gueuzes
around
world
class
and
worth
seeking
out
o
this
was
one
of
my
few
gueze
experiences
but
it
was
a
great
one
i
had
this
in
bottle
format
not
3
nights
later
and
it
was
still
an
amazing
brew
overall
great
great
fruit
and
sour
flavors
nice
wild
funk
dry
finish
keeps
you
coming
back
for
more
this
is
an
effort
that
was
well
worth
the
three
years
of
labor
needed
to
reach
this
state
a
great
not
over
the
top
gueuze
that
is
bound
to
turn
some
heads
d
i
had
two
glasses
and
other
than
the
fact
that
my
stomach
was
melting
by
the
end
i
would
have
had
more
too
expensive
in
the
us
for
drinking
all
night
but
if
this
was
at
a
belgian
bar
for
a
few
euros
id
definitely
indulge
dry
very
well
balanced
sourness
and
funk
this
is
very
well
done
overall
and
a
great
geuze
to
boot
especially
for
one
that
seems
to
be
fairly
readily
available
it
comes
very
close
to
some
the
3f
geuzes
that
i
have
tasted
in
terms
of
complexity
and
wellroundedness
and
i
would
gladly
revisit
it
again
o
this
is
a
very
tasty
gueuze
what
it
lacked
in
appearance
it
delivered
big
time
in
aroma
and
flavor
this
first
gueuze
experience
drie
fonteinen
doesjel
wasnt
so
great
so
im
hoping
this
is
better
this
beer
pours
a
cloudy
bright
copper
in
color
with
a
light
white
lacing
around
the
glass
it
smells
of
fermented
peaches
has
some
funk
but
what
i
would
describe
as
a
lot
and
also
features
a
mild
tartness
and
light
alcohol
the
flavors
are
much
better
than
in
my
first
gueuze
experience
you
actually
get
some
fruit
it
instantly
bites
your
tongue
with
peach
skin
like
tartness
its
almost
the
perfect
amount
of
sour
it
has
light
funk
and
wasnt
heavy
on
sediment
whatsoever
perhaps
the
biggest
difference
is
the
mouthfeel
it
has
a
nice
crisp
bite
to
it
i
really
like
it
im
glad
i
tried
this
so
it
gives
me
better
prospective
on
the
style
now
on
to
the
next
one
orange
and
amber
color
slightly
golden
light
carbonation
almost
disappears
by
the
end
of
the
glass
smell
is
funky
like
blue
cheese
and
feet
sort
of
unpleasant
but
dead
on
for
the
style
clean
and
refreshing
flavor
crisp
dry
and
very
sour
mouthwatering
with
little
mouthcoat
overall
a
very
good
gueuze
and
one
of
my
new
favorites
cheers
mouthfeel
is
crisp
but
not
as
dry
as
some
overall
an
excellent
queuze
that
comes
across
as
a
bit
more
well
balanced
than
many
others
doverall
this
is
a
weak
gueuze
but
not
a
terrible
one
it
isnt
a
pain
to
finish
but
its
not
something
im
likely
to
purchase
again
itll
fill
any
temporary
sour
desires
though
sourness
clenches
your
jaw
but
it
doesnt
come
off
as
very
sour
lemony
vinegar
component
with
a
dry
bretty
finish
of
leather
and
hay
maybe
even
some
tobacco
its
not
a
bitter
brett
finish
though
the
acidity
wipes
your
palate
it
hits
on
your
salt
sensors
carbonation
is
fairly
light
this
is
probably
the
easiest
hanssens
lambics
to
take
down
by
yourself
lots
of
raw
funk
not
an
over
powering
acidity
overall
excellent
taste
with
a
good
level
of
sourness
i
will
buy
this
one
again
d
a
nice
gueuze
sipper
i
mostly
get
sour
tart
flavors
from
this
one
but
i
am
still
very
new
to
this
style
bring
on
the
funky
shit
o
another
fantastic
representation
of
the
style
full
on
sour
power
in
this
one
d
not
my
favorite
gueze
experience
so
far
and
though
ive
definitely
had
more
drinkable
guezes
or
at
least
ones
i
prefer
im
also
new
to
this
style
i
feel
its
important
to
hold
off
passing
judgement
until
ive
accustomed
my
palate
to
these
beers
what
i
will
say
though
is
that
this
beer
gave
me
heartburn
this
was
my
first
foray
into
geuze
and
i
did
not
know
what
to
expect
the
smell
almost
scared
me
but
it
tastes
damn
fine
very
happy
to
have
tried
this
and
looking
forward
to
more
unsure
of
the
abv
but
im
sure
its
reasonable
edit
i
had
this
beer
again
recently
beside
3f
tilquin
cantillon
and
oude
beersel
and
hanssens
was
my
hands
down
favorite
i
plan
on
acquiring
more
bottles
of
as
many
gueuzes
as
possible
and
do
a
blind
tasting
with
friends
to
see
if
that
had
anything
to
do
with
it
d
really
good
but
its
not
quite
at
that
craveable
level
that
i
get
from
some
of
the
toptier
gueuzes
like
cantillion
100
lambic
and
girardin
1882
still
quite
tasty
id
never
turn
this
one
down
a
very
nice
beer
simply
put
this
is
a
must
try
im
not
particularly
experienced
with
sours
as
this
is
the
first
authentic
gueuze
ive
had
the
other
being
lindemans
regular
gueuze
its
very
good
but
im
having
trouble
picking
out
certain
flavors
this
beer
seems
a
bit
lacking
in
complexity
also
i
dont
really
know
how
well
it
stacks
up
against
other
examples
of
the
style
still
i
can
tell
how
much
i
like
this
beer
and
that
is
quite
a
bit
recommended
especially
for
fans
of
the
style
an
excellent
gueuze
that
is
a
perfect
showcase
for
the
rounded
tartness
of
lactic
acid
no
harsh
acetic
acid
and
very
little
funky
brett
notes
very
balanced
d
one
of
the
best
widely
available
geyser
that
ive
come
across
this
one
is
well
worth
the
price
super
funky
tart
and
complex
will
likely
age
gracefully
for
years
to
come
worth
picking
up
a
few
bottles
to
cellar
this
is
a
gueuze
ive
never
heard
hyped
but
i
think
its
one
of
the
best
ive
had
great
surprise
need
to
track
down
some
more
of
these
drinkability
moderate
due
to
sournessacidity
nice
sour
but
i
think
i
prefer
the
cuvee
rene
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
near
perfection
sour
apple
pretty
sour
makes
you
salivate
followed
by
earthy
funk
and
barnyard
spiciness
still
sour
this
is
the
one
hanssens
beer
i
have
sampled
that
had
carbonation
thank
god
i
really
enjoy
it
but
its
on
the
end
of
almost
being
too
sour
for
me
mouth
puckering
complex
nearing
a
vinegar
aftertaste
i
got
a
bit
of
heartburn
after
drinking
it
d
tasty
very
balanced
gueuze
this
was
good
quite
good
really
great
flavor
through
out
i
plan
on
buying
a
bunch
more
really
very
good
d
a
solid
gueuze
that
was
very
tasty
and
drank
better
than
expected
great
offering
from
the
hanssen
blenders
very
crisp
no
real
body
great
finish
for
the
style
very
approachable
could
be
used
as
a
great
intro
into
the
style
great
d
high
drinkability
with
the
amount
of
sourness
and
acidic
notes
but
that
is
why
i
liked
it
this
is
a
great
gueuze
im
not
really
sure
i
can
elaborate
any
better
than
the
couple
hundred
folks
whove
gone
before
me
ive
had
some
awesome
beers
lately
and
this
damn
near
the
top
funky
as
hell
and
delicious
its
probably
the
best
gueuze
ive
had
yet
d
good
drinkability
splitting
a
375
was
about
right
could
have
soloed
it
but
might
have
gotten
tired
of
the
powerful
tart
a
solid
gueuze
d
high
for
something
this
vinegary
and
funky
dryness
is
keeping
it
from
being
55
this
also
stays
on
your
palate
for
awhile
opened
the
bottle
and
there
was
a
subtle
whoosh
not
the
pop
i
was
expecting
it
pours
a
beautiful
straw
color
with
a
small
white
head
retention
is
decent
for
the
head
being
so
small
there
is
a
tiny
bit
of
lacing
wafts
of
yeast
funk
barnyard
and
tart
fruit
hit
the
nose
great
the
taste
is
very
tart
and
dry
with
some
apple
and
citrus
sourness
that
lingers
on
and
on
it
just
beckons
you
to
take
another
sip
extremely
inviting
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
due
to
the
lack
of
carbonation
but
it
still
holds
up
well
overall
i
think
this
is
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
refreshing
and
satisfying
drinkability
not
going
to
lie
there
is
no
way
i
could
come
close
to
drinking
this
all
night
smellsflavors
are
just
too
intense
however
i
found
it
tasty
in
a
mouth
puckering
way
i
would
love
to
try
more
of
this
style
i
dont
think
there
any
way
i
will
ever
be
a
sour
lover
but
its
a
decent
start
piquant
refreshing
and
flavorful
this
is
a
very
interesting
beer
wow
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
it
took
my
taste
buds
ona
ride
they
surely
wont
forget
worth
a
try
bangforbuck
hanssens
artissinal
smokes
cantillon
any
day
of
the
week
sorry
d
moderately
drinkable
very
complex
i
wish
i
was
more
experienced
with
this
style
but
i
know
this
one
is
quality
this
gueuze
packs
quite
the
kick
as
usual
with
hanssens
acidity
and
funk
are
sharp
and
intense
on
the
nose
its
leathery
dusty
a
bit
mineral
theres
a
touch
of
oak
on
the
palate
but
its
overwhelmed
by
sharp
lactic
acidity
its
faintly
metallic
very
funky
and
musty
with
a
berrylike
fruitiness
lemonlike
acidity
lingers
in
the
finish
a
very
solid
gueuze
the
carbonation
really
helps
on
this
one
and
its
very
drinkable
for
the
style
excellent
stuff
always
a
goto
for
me
thanks
to
my
brother
andy
for
sharing
this
one
with
me
poured
into
a
chalice
the
body
is
a
light
slightly
hazy
golden
color
with
just
a
thin
layer
of
bubbly
white
head
and
lots
of
visible
carbonation
no
real
retention
and
just
a
thin
ring
of
lace
the
smell
is
tart
apples
barnyard
yeast
and
slight
vinegar
the
taste
is
tart
and
slightly
sweet
apples
with
a
bit
of
must
and
vinegar
to
the
tart
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
light
with
ample
carbonation
and
the
drinkability
is
great
on
this
light
easy
drinking
beer
drinkability
good
true
this
isnt
a
beer
for
wimps
or
neophytes
but
it
is
one
of
the
great
ones
drinkability
quite
enjoyable
great
depth
very
engaging
but
still
very
balanced
and
approachable
not
to
imply
this
an
entrylevel
gueuze
such
a
thing
exists
but
this
would
be
a
pretty
sensible
place
to
start
for
someone
interested
in
the
style
musttry
edit
older
vintages
have
much
better
head
retention
and
lace
and
become
very
grapefruity
funky
grapefruit
hits
the
back
of
the
palate
and
tastes
more
like
real
grapefruit
than
any
taste
ive
ever
tasted
in
beer
awesome
bumping
my
appearance
score
to
5
because
the
last
bottle
i
poured
just
had
the
best
headlace
of
any
geuze
ive
poured
and
bumping
taste
because
i
now
see
how
epic
this
one
is
with
some
age
on
it
and
because
it
truly
is
exceptional
a
style
that
i
love
but
this
is
a
bit
of
a
let
down
for
me
there
is
a
huge
acidic
sourness
and
not
much
else
i
really
do
love
the
sour
but
a
great
gueuze
has
so
much
more
depth
that
helps
balanced
out
the
sourness
this
does
not
have
that
depth
still
something
that
i
think
is
worth
a
try
it
just
does
not
stack
up
with
the
big
boys
imo
pours
a
bright
yellow
with
a
towering
white
head
and
a
good
amount
of
lacing
nose
is
incredibly
funky
near
the
most
funk
and
earth
that
ive
ever
encountered
no
need
for
sourness
when
theres
this
much
barnyard
going
on
the
taste
is
a
bit
overwhelming
even
though
i
love
this
stuff
just
super
raw
and
pungent
nice
dry
mouthfeel
with
good
carbonation
drinkability
is
a
bit
toward
the
low
end
given
the
sheer
magnitude
of
the
flavor
and
the
fact
that
its
fairly
one
dimensional
d
very
sour
but
also
refreshing
this
is
a
nice
lambic
but
it
also
doesnt
strike
me
as
terribly
unique
im
not
too
familiar
with
the
style
so
based
on
popular
opinion
im
going
to
believe
its
good
overall
this
is
a
world
class
beer
and
even
more
proof
in
my
opinion
that
gueuze
is
the
pinnacle
of
beer
i
would
put
this
right
up
there
in
the
conversation
with
any
other
classic
d
while
this
isnt
something
id
would
drink
on
a
regular
basis
it
is
an
interesting
and
flavorful
experience
drinkable
very
very
good
need
more
of
this
for
aging
and
just
plain
enjoying
cheers
d
the
beer
is
very
drinkable
for
the
style
because
the
sourness
is
not
very
overpowering
loved
it
i
hope
to
try
this
again
sometime
in
the
coming
months
d
very
easy
to
drink
but
at
9
99
a
bottle
it
gets
a
little
expensive
this
particular
example
has
20
years
of
aging
and
may
have
lost
its
carbonation
and
the
cork
could
have
imparted
much
more
flavor
than
the
brewer
intends
itll
be
nice
to
compare
a
new
one
to
see
d
a
delicious
beer
easy
drinking
i
definitely
wanted
some
runny
soft
cheese
while
i
was
drinking
it
a
shame
this
is
8
50
for
a
small
bottle
but
well
worth
it
if
youre
going
to
charge
that
much
i
better
get
a
5
on
taste
and
this
beer
delivers
hanssens
is
a
classic
im
glad
to
see
them
back
on
the
shelves
in
the
southland
now
only
if
we
could
get
cantillon
back
wed
be
in
business
dsolid
beer
and
probably
doesnt
get
the
credit
it
deserves
it
lacks
the
balance
and
complexity
of
some
of
the
better
gueuze
but
is
still
a
tasty
beer
that
is
easily
enjoyed
d
a
fantastic
gueuze
a
great
balance
not
overly
sour
or
funky
but
is
fittingly
potent
crisp
with
a
good
acidity
level
while
this
is
great
this
one
bottle
is
plenty
for
one
sitting
by
myself
it
took
me
almost
an
hour
to
consume
nontheless
a
great
example
of
the
style
d
very
nice
and
complex
sipper
opaque
maple
syrup
color
with
yellow
orange
hues
slightly
opaque
smell
has
white
grape
peaches
green
apple
and
lemon
all
of
the
aforementioned
are
sour
smelling
but
theres
other
lighter
sweeter
smelling
fruits
like
strawberries
and
black
raspberries
that
are
also
present
taste
has
an
intense
sourness
to
it
lemon
white
grape
and
apple
are
dominant
here
with
a
certain
belgian
funk
present
along
with
oak
throughout
that
accentuates
the
fruit
mouthfeel
is
oily
viscous
slightly
smooth
but
still
watery
1
750ml
will
do
for
me
this
evening
a
bit
too
sour
for
me
to
have
a
few
of
this
is
my
first
gueuze
ever
i
will
be
trying
a
few
more
wow
what
a
beer
sampled
at
the
goose
island
clybourn
april
2010
tasting
cidery
vinegary
nose
with
peppery
notes
flavor
is
precursed
by
a
sweetness
on
the
tongue
followed
by
the
tart
sour
apple
flavor
explosion
a
unique
brew
by
a
great
brewer
silky
smooth
with
a
subtle
mouthfeel
very
drinkable
with
a
lingering
complexity
this
is
one
for
the
ages
hopefully
they
keep
on
making
it
notes
perhaps
the
best
and
most
drinkable
straight
gueuze
ive
had
to
date
375
ml
corked
and
caged
bottle
served
in
a
tulip
the
beer
pours
a
dark
goldamber
color
with
pretty
much
no
head
at
all
no
lacing
either
great
aroma
the
brew
smells
like
funk
vinegar
lemon
zest
and
tart
cherries
and
apples
the
beer
tastes
like
tart
applescherriespears
vinegar
and
funk
theres
also
a
bit
of
fruity
sweetness
noticable
too
but
the
lingering
finish
is
tart
for
the
most
part
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
the
sourtartness
is
very
noticable
but
not
overpowering
mouthfeelbody
is
lightmedium
its
a
bit
slick
and
dry
with
low
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
i
dont
know
if
i
could
drink
more
than
one
bottle
of
this
at
a
time
but
also
i
dont
have
any
problems
finishing
the
bottle
i
just
drank
i
think
this
is
a
good
overall
brew
if
i
was
in
the
mood
for
a
gueuze
i
wouldnt
have
any
problem
buying
this
one
again
d
not
the
most
drinkable
gueuze
ive
ever
had
but
very
refreshing
and
finishes
balanced
enough
to
not
leave
your
mouth
feeling
beat
up
after
every
sip
d
i
love
these
styles
of
beer
but
only
like
to
have
a
maximum
of
two
glasses
mainly
because
if
i
drink
them
too
late
at
night
they
give
me
a
little
heart
burn
regardless
give
this
one
a
try
if
you
like
the
style
and
you
wont
be
disappointed
the
mouthfeel
is
good
as
well
a
medium
body
though
it
is
certainly
undercarbonated
the
drinkability
is
great
d
a
very
nice
gueuze
i
think
the
sourness
and
the
predominantly
lemon
flavor
eventually
slows
this
one
down
a
good
example
of
the
style
for
sure
the
mouthfeel
has
low
carbonation
but
is
still
lively
on
the
palate
drinkability
suffers
a
little
bit
because
of
the
extreme
sourness
so
this
needs
to
be
a
special
treat
absolutely
delicious
with
great
harmony
between
malt
sourness
and
hops
low
bitterness
and
no
woody
character
noticeably
sweet
great
drinkabiliity
and
well
crafted
truly
a
refreshing
beer
poured
a
corked
and
caged
375ml
into
my
hennepin
globe
glass
this
bee
pours
a
peachy
tangerine
with
a
2
inch
head
the
quickly
fades
into
just
a
lily
pad
on
top
of
the
beer
subtle
lacing
is
found
around
the
glass
the
nose
is
well
gueuzey
bright
lemon
tartness
slight
must
a
bit
of
salt
and
just
a
hint
of
ammonia
the
flavor
starts
off
the
bat
with
freshly
zested
lemon
grapefruit
tartness
hits
the
back
of
the
jaw
mellowing
into
musty
barnyard
the
mouthfeel
is
moderately
dry
leaving
just
a
hint
of
residual
sweetness
this
is
a
great
gueuze
not
much
more
to
say
then
that
im
glad
i
opted
for
the
small
bottle
cause
a
whole
bottle
of
this
would
of
literally
killed
me
or
seriously
fed
up
my
inside
linings
i
can
drink
some
types
of
sours
all
day
but
i
seem
to
take
it
easy
with
gueuzes
this
particular
one
started
eating
away
at
my
insides
with
just
a
few
ounces
that
means
its
doing
its
job
this
beer
rocks
its
just
not
meant
for
a
large
amount
for
a
man
of
my
stature
im
popping
some
tums
before
bed
tonight
drinkability
refreshing
and
rather
light
body
the
tart
aspect
is
great
and
the
moderate
abv
would
allow
for
a
couple
of
these
to
get
sipped
on
over
the
course
of
an
evening
a
great
summer
beer
but
i
would
take
it
anytime
what
a
nice
beer
and
a
great
value
pours
a
nice
hazy
golden
color
with
some
white

tremendous
beer
for
the
price
an
11
99
750
ml
gueuze
of
this
quality
is
pretty
tough
to
find
d
i
am
not
sure
i
can
put
it
into
words
but
i
am
going
to
try
i
wish
i
had
a
kidney
size
swimming
pool
of
this
brew
to
swim
in
but
alas
i
would
most
likely
drink
it
all
out
of
the
pool
and
end
up
in
the
er
with
alcohol
poisoning
it
would
be
worth
it
i
love
this
beer
great
gueuze
one
of
the
more
lemonysour
ones
i
have
tried
great
mouthfeel
and
a
mouthwatering
flavor
the
beer
is
lightly
carbonated
not
sure
how
long
it
was
aged
in
barrels
or
in
the
bottle
very
dry
finish
only
6
abv
as
it
should
be
extremely
drinkable
to
me
but
i
like
lambicsgueuzeswild
ales
if
you
dont
like
them
sour
dont
get
this
d
worth
tasting
but
the
intense
acidity
makes
it
difficult
to
consider
a
second
bottle
in
a
sitting
beer
is
thin
with
great
carbonation
in
the
mouth
drinkability
is
high
lots
of
citric
not
so
much
acetic
its
really
really
great
i
love
this
beer
d
a
very
enjoyable
lambic
if
you
like
tart
and
funk
feels
like
champagne
almost
with
a
kick
would
try
again
the
flavor
is
instantly
tart
and
musky
the
tartness
shows
up
in
apples
and
lemons
with
a
white
wine
flavor
thats
very
present
as
well
the
muskiness
comes
in
a
very
effervescent
way
reminded
me
of
leather
in
the
middle
of
the
profile
with
something
very
similar
to
hay
and
basement
the
mouth
feel
is
enticing
as
it
feels
both
heavy
on
flavor
but
its
as
if
the
beer
evaporates
on
your
tongue
it
slides
down
so
easy
an
interesting
and
enticing
sipper
for
sure
m
despite
the
low
carbonation
the
acidity
keeps
the
beer
sharp
and
light
d
i
cant
hide
that
i
simply
love
this
beer
i
would
be
happy
to
drink
one
anytime
o
i
would
like
less
acetic
acid
but
still
good
review
from
notes
taken
on
121209
d
theres
only
so
much
of
this
stuff
you
can
drink
before
it
burns
a
hole
in
your
stomach
but
even
then
id
probably
keep
drinking
it
one
of
the
better
gueuzes
ive
had
and
at
the
price
you
cant
beat
it
bottle
into
a
tulip
glass
this
is
my
first
sample
in
this
style
and
i
loved
it
poured
a
deep
amberorange
color
with
only
a
trace
of
white
head
lacing
was
minimal
but
some
hung
on
the
glass
until
the
end
the
nose
well
all
i
can
describe
it
as
is
earthy
there
is
no
discernible
aroma
but
the
smell
was
of
a
muddy
creek
after
a
rain
or
of
that
nice
wet
hay
smell
on
the
farm
very
pleasant
when
i
tasted
i
was
shocked
at
first
at
how
sour
this
was
as
the
aromas
gave
no
hint
of
that
very
lively
carbonation
pops
a
strong
lemon
on
the
tongue
and
complimented
my
sharp
cheddar
burger
beautifully
pours
a
nice
pale
orange
with
a
very
small
amount
of
haze
for
a
gueuze
nose
is
lemon
melon
sour
and
a
very
nice
and
deep
bouquet
of
earthy
musky
funk
flavor
is
a
fruit
blast
pineapple
lemon
kiwi
with
a
tart
tangy
and
peppery
finish
that
leaves
a
beautiful
exhale
very
vinous
with
a
pinot
grigio
quality
at
once
both
sharp
and
refreshing
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
and
one
of
my
new
favorites
at
under
14
for
a
750ml
i
dont
know
that
this
beer
can
be
beat
excellent
stuff
this
geuze
is
more
sour
than
many
of
the
other
belgian
versions
ive
had
it
looks
to
bowl
you
over
with
the
sourness
and
then
impress
you
with
the
subtle
complexities
underneat
beautifully
done
hanssens
as
i
understand
it
is
only
a
blender
rather
than
a
creator
but
who
cares
this
beer
is
delicious
next
time
ill
be
serving
it
in
the
proper
glassware
but
it
probably
wont
be
as
fun
really
nice
guezuze
and
at
a
good
price
while
i
wouldnt
put
this
up
there
with
canillon
it
is
one
of
the
finer
sours
ive
come
across
hurrah
for
hanssens
overall
this
beer
was
tough
to
get
through
i
wish
i
knew
what
year
it
was
overall
a
very
nice
ale
at
a
decent
price
with
the
smaller
bottle
ill
likely
work
this
into
my
rotation
in
an
effort
to
stop
drinking
so
many
expensive
750ml
bottles
of
american
wild
ale
when
i
need
my
sour
fix
becomes
noticeably
fruitier
with
the
addition
of
some
yeast
from
the
bottle
seems
to
be
a
good
gueuze
but
again
i
lack
experience
with
this
style
so
i
cant
say
how
it
compares
to
many
others
even
so
this
was
quite
enjoyable
if
i
had
another
i
very
well
may
have
poured
it
into
a
pint
glass
and
gulped
it
down
this
bottle
has
lasted
quite
some
time
and
will
continue
to
entertain
me
for
the
balance
of
the
evening
sit
and
slowly
enjoy
this
beer
this
beer
finishes
with
a
lingering
lasting
sour
tang
and
a
vigirous
carbonation
that
makes
the
tongue
tingle
after
the
beer
is
gone
this
is
a
nice
earth
version
of
the
gueuze
and
a
real
treat
this
beer
is
very
complex
and
while
it
has
a
good
bit
of
barnyard
tart
funkiness
it
is
not
acidic
at
all
as
has
a
lot
of
complexity
integrating
sweet
estery
light
fruit
notes
resulting
in
one
of
the
most
drinkable
sours
ive
had
yet
highly
recommended
d
good
very
refreshing
and
fairly
complex
overall
pretty
good
though
not
quite
at
the
level
as
the
other
gueuze
ive
had
recently
definitely
recommend
it

this

may
not

as
all
the

ones
out

but
that
does
not
mean
it
lacks
in
quality
one
of
the
best
sours
you
can
get
for

will
drink
this
again
recommended
oh
and
pair
this
with
a
triplecream
cheese
the
contrasts
and
compliments
between
them
will
be
striking
and
strikingly
delicious
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
which
is
certainly
an
acquired
taste
on
my
introduction
to
the
gueuze
style
i
was
astonished
shocked
even
at
the
radical
departure
from
conventional
beer
the
only
place
i
would
score
lower
than
top
is
drinkability
it
is
not
something
you
knock
back
but
really
sip
and
savour
from
the
satisfying
pop
of
the
little
champagne
style
cork
through
the
nice
soft
foamy
pouring
into
the
glass
the
complex
musty
slightly
pungent
aroma
through
the
searing
withering
puckering
tartness
it
is
really
something
to
ponder
i
particularly
love
the
tart
apple
merging
with
nutty
earthy
notes
i
have
to
thank
a
chance
meeting
with
a
beer
geek
at
hop
leaf
for
this
awakening

a
hazy

had

to
a

perfect
for
a
sour
beer
it
does
not
get
any
better
than
this
a
nicely
crafted
beer
that
has
a
nice
wide
spectrum
of
flavor
refreshing
and
a
nice
change
of
pace
d
not
badlots
of
vinegarlike
sourness
in
the
gueze
would
be
interested
in
trying
this
in
a
kriek
to
seeif
the
balance
is
better
for
me
this
one
is
a
bit
too
far
to
the
sour
side
to
call
great
although
very
good
enjoyed
this
with
some
trappist
cheese
d
this
is
refreshing
much
like
a
tall
glass
of
lemonade
on
a
hot
day
unlike
lemonade
it
gets
better
as
it
warms
im
still
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
sour
beers
but
this
one
is
pretty
good
overall
it
tastes
like
sour
wood
yuck
overall
impression
is
that
this
is
a
very
wellconstructed
gueuze
that
is
true
to
its
style
warmth
helps
soften
the
acidity
a
great
deal
to
where
it
becomes
much
less
harsh
and
the
huskier
barnyardhorse
blanket
aromas
emerge
still
a
bit
more
acidic
than
other
gueuze
examples
i
recall
but
a
very
good
effort

the

i
have
very
little
experience
with
sours
but
was
craving
something
different
and
i
really
enjoyed
this
looking
forward
to
trying
some
others
i
hadnt
had
a
gueuze
lambic
in
a
while
so
i
ordered
this
one
from
the
twopage
belgian
beer
menu
at
the
bar
i
had
never
heard
of
this
particular
beer
before
and
i
was
in
a
celebration
mood
so
the
aboveaverage
price
was
fine
with
me
i
love
the
sourness
and
would
most
certainly
order
this
beer
again
this
is
an
exceptionally
good
gueuze
full
of
funk
acidity
and
character
but
staying
crisp
and
drinkable
probably
not
an
entry
level
gueuze
due
to
the
high
degree
of
funk
and
acidity
but
a
great
one
if
youre
looking
for
the
top
end
of
the
scale
this
beer
pours
as
a
bright
and
hazy
golden
color
with
a
thick
and
white
soapy
head
the
aroma
is
tart
like
lemon
juice
with
a
lot
of
barnyard
and
horse
sweat
funk
there
is
a
touch
of
yeast
and
some
very
pale
grainy
malt
the
taste
is
moderately
sour
with
a
citric
and
earthy
flavor
solidly
good
the
texture
is
very
nice
the
combination
of
sourness
and
astringency
layered
with
the
carbonation
is
very
pleasing
refreshing
and
very
inviting
this
is
a
very
nice
gueuze

glad
to
have
this
anytime
among
the
best
in

a
ridiculously
refreshing
beer
that
i
rate
very
high
for
the
style
in
drinkability
just
so
good
invigorating
each
sip
is
like
plunging
your
tatse
buds
into
a
cold
stream
had
a
bottle
in
ghent
and
was
quite
pleased
poured
a
hazy
amber
gold
and
thick
white
head
the
big
character
here
is
the
toasted
oak
barrel
flavor
after
that
is
more
of
typical
of
great
oude
guezes
ripping
sour
tang
that
hits
the
back

your
cheekbones
with

have
another
drinkability
this
bottle
was
shared
with
a
friend
which
provided
just
enough
enjoyment
over
a
slow
sipping
period
this
is
not
a
beer
to
quaff
all
night
long
both
prove
to
be
true
hannsens
is
pleasingly
sour
and
acidic
without
diving
too
hard
into
the
vinegar
spectrum
although
its
present
too
strong
citric
presence
alcohol
is
muted
the
body
is
just
fine
pretty
thin
overall
but
smooth
enough
carbonation
makes
some
elements
of
the
sip
seem
like
carbonated
water
great
sour
beer
exactly
what
a
gueuze
should
act
like
rare
cask
serving
at
map
room
10
oz
pour
into
a
sam
smith
glass
bright
orange
with
a
light
haze
a
surprising
puffy
head
that
rises
above
the
rim
for
a
few
minutes
miniscule
traces
of
carbonation
rise
to
the
surface
mildly
pungent
and
sharp
wet
wood
with
a
vegetal
note
like
wildflower
and
lemon
peel
compost
tastes
much
the
same
a
moderately
citric
lemon
sourness
610
scale
very
soft
and
supple
feel
with
little
carbonation
the
woody
element
seems
to
dominate
with
some
bitter
tannin
in
the
aftertaste
a
few
of
these
would
be
really
great
but
i
had
to
limit
myself
to
one
the
novelty
of
the
cask
serving
made
me
daydream
of
what
it
must
be
like
to
drink
in
the
rare
lambic
cafes
found
in
belgium
also
thanks
to
quinnsi
who
shared
a
bottle
recently
at
sheffields
this
was
one
of
the
most
enjoyable
sour
beers
ive
ever
had
poured
a
beautiful
cloudy
orange
color
with
no
real
head
aroma
is
very
tart
filled
with
the
smell
of
green
apple
funk
and
dry
tartness
taste
is
awesome
nice
tart
funk
flavor
fills
the
mouth
but
fades
rather
quickly
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
but
filled
with
carbonation
drinkability
is
definitely
due
to
the
fact
that
it
reminds
me
of
more
expensive
rr
sours
even
though
its
a
gueze
overall
a
great
beer
and
a
great
substitute
when
youre
craving
the
above
mentioned
sours
a
pleasure
to
drink

d
mediumbodied
the
carbonation
feels
slightly
sharp
upfront
yet
turning
softer
as
it
breathes
the
focused
flavour
profile
is
perhaps
the
strongest
point
in
this
beer
it
couldve
been
more
complex
if
given
some
more
time
to
mature
i
guess
but
the
beer
as
of
now
is
already
delicious
and
full
of
joy
i
still
wonder
why
no
freshness
info
is
printed
on
the
label
d
for
a
style
that
i
nearly
always
find
marginally
undrinkable
hannssens
is
quite
drinkable
the
main
factor
here
is
the
lack
of
abosutely
caustic
sourness
and
acidity
that
ive
experienced
in
other
beers
here
the
sourness
is
much
more
restrained
and
the
brettwild
character
is
accentuated
great
stuff
opinion
this
is
a
pretty
damn
good
gueuze
i
like
the
balance
it
has
and
would
actually
be
a
pretty
good
one
for
someone
who
was
new
to
this
style
as
wild
as
their
mead
the
gueuze
was
i
was
expecting
something
more
assertive
as
it
is
this
is
a
nice
blend
of
course
i
would
drink
this
beer
again
but
i
prefer
like
a
girardin
black
label
or
some
such
either
way
a
good
beer
to
try
drinkability
is
definitely
low
just
due
to
the
complexity
and
tartness
but
this
was
one
of
the
most
spectacular
drinks
ive
had
taste
is
that
of
the
most
dry
sour
white
wine
that
i
have
ever
had
it
hit
me
like
a
ton
of
lemon
flavored
bricks
my
brother
liked
it
he
was
gulping
it
down
but
he
had
already
ingested
a
few
ipas
as
well
as
half
a
bottle
of
hennepin
oh
and
a
margarita
but
anyhow
this
was
just
too
much
sourness
for
me
it
took
me
off
guard
and
perhaps
next
time
i
try
a
geuze
i
will
be
more
prepared
i
expected
a
sweeter
wine
profile
maybe
that
is
what
a
lambic
tastes
like
as
opposed
to
a
geuze
i
dont
know
i
accidentally
paired
it
with
curry
chicken
and
it
was
a
very
pleasant
surprise
by
accidentally
i
mean
i
popped
it
open
and
10
minutes
later
my
wife
says
ready
for
curry
chicken
they
both
have
distinct
and
strong
flavors
but
didnt
fight
at
all
in
fact
they
seemed
to
keep
each
other
at
bay
d
this
is
a
great
drinking
beer
probably
not
something
you
want
to
pound
a
lot
of
but
definitely
on
the
high
end
if
you
are
in
the
mood
for
a
geueze
d
not
something
id
drink
heaps
of
but
id
definately
drink
this
again
di
need
to
pair
this
with
food
preferably
cheese
andor
bread
i
reviewed
this
with
oude
en
jonge
goude
cheeses
if
you
do
enjoy
the
flavor
then
the
drinkability
is
quite
high
the
beer
does
not
hit
you
with
any
hard
alcohol
taste
or
impact
so
it
can
be
enjoyed
over
and
over
again
d
what
a
way
to
start
thanksgiving
i
scared
my
father
with
this
beer
a
fairly
extreme
gueze
but
very
well
balanced
love
it

not

i
wish
it
were
a
hot
summer
day
because
this
beer
is
brilliant

beer

beautiful

not

it
smells

the

dusty

it
tastes
sour
citrus
lemons
good
gueuze
the
mouthfeel
seemed
a
little
thin
at
first
but
overall
it
was
adequate
drinkability
is
how
much
good
sour
you
can
stand
review
from
tasting
notes
pale
orange
hazy
aroma
is
slighty
vegetal
spicy
and
sour
to
say
the
least
horse
blanket
and
dirty
feet
funkyness
not
all
that
appealing
flavor
follows
suit
but
not
as
strong
as
the
nose
very
sour
and
tart
some
fruitiness
slightly
medicinal
low
carbonation
very
slick
on
the
tongue
i
like
the
funk
and
the
sour
but
this
is
a
bit
much
for
my
personal
taste
im
sure
there
are
many
who
appreciate
it
for
the
style
and
more
power
to
them
just
cant
see
myself
seeking
more
of
this
out
drinking
more
than
one
at
a
time
would
be
overwhelming
for
me
i
like
sour
beers
very
much
but
there
are
other
sour
styles
i
would
rather
partake
in
this
brew
poured
up
a
straight
yellow
color
the
aroma
was
sour
also
smelled
a
little
of
urine
the
taste
was
super
duper
sour
im
in
limbo
right
now
about
this
beer
do
i
have
another
one
to
give
it
a
second
shot
or
do
i
let
it
ride
on
down
the
stream
past
me
a
powerhouse
gueuze
for
sure
near
the
end
of
it
i
took
a
slice
of
creamy
chimay
cheese
from
my
fridge
and
ate
it
with
it
it
made
a
great
pairing
crystal
clear
gold
small
thin
egg
shell
white
head
recedes
really
fast
and
a
foamy
ring
lingers
the
rest
of
the
way
the
barn
and
old
leather
type
aromas
come
through
easily
at
first
as
for
the
taste
its
hard
to
say
much
other
than
sour
its
obviously
got
that
earthy
component
that
is
found
in
the
aroma
it
just
comes
through
a
bit
different
in
the
taste
not
as
intensely
sour
as
i
thought
it
would
be
the
most
recent
gueze
ive
had
was
beatification
a
few
days
ago
and
that
seemed
to
be
more
intense
still
very
good
hanssens
has
lived
up
to
everything
i
had
heard
about
them
poured
a
cloudy
orange
body
with
good
carobonation
that
gives
a
large
head
that
leaves
a
lace
sheath
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
tart
citric
drinks
but
this
is
different
while
it
is
extremely
tart
and
carbonated
in
a
medium
body
it
contains
a
good
amount
of
fruit
in
the
taste
like
apple
grape
some
sour
citrus
and
has
a
dry
backbite
that
kicks
your
ass
while
theres
no
malts
i
can
put
my
finger
on
theres
a
very
mild
sweetness
that
shields
this
beer
from
being
overly
bitter
i
didnt
drink
this
for
a
special
occasion
it
is
not
necessary
i
recommend
this
to
any
adventorous
beer
drinker
golden
amber
color
with
a
quickly
fading
fizzy
head
sweaty
smelly
feet
is
all
i
get
this
is
really
too
much
i
had
to
let
this
thing
warm
up
for
about
a
half
hour
before
that
smell
died
down
a
bit
ok
lemon
hay
and
some
apples
the
feet
aroma
is
still
there
this
is
not
a
subtle
stinky
feet
aroma
this
is
a
big
fat
sweaty
guy
sticking
his
toes
in
your
nose
stink
served
from
a
750ml
bottle
and
pours
a
orange
cloudy
beer
a
nice
foamy
head
that
quickly
settles
to
a
light
lace
on
top
of
the
beer
the
smell
is
a
little
bitter
with
an
aroma
of
bananas
dry
cider
and
also
i
detect
some
pear
the
taste
is
bitter
at
the
nose
and
throughout
their
is
also
a
hint
of
vinegar
taste
you
can
definitely
taste
some
fruits
before
the
champagne
dryness
comes
through
this
is
extremely
tart
and
not
my
style
but
i
have
to
judge
it
on
the
style
and
it
fits
it
to
a
tie
even
though
it
could
have
a
little
bit
more
of
a
fruit
taste
to
it
the
beer
is
carbonated
like
a
glass
of
champagne
and
likewise
does
not
have
that
much
drinkability
even
for
the
style
i
think
it
is
to
tart
to
drink
a
lot
refreshingly
acidic
and
dry
could
use
a
tad
more
esters
or
malt
sweetness
overall
this
beer
is
not
for
everyone
in
fact
i
would
venture
to
say
that
the
few
people
that
do
like
this
are
at
least
a
little
bit
crazy
its
sour
overwhelming
intense
and
it
makes
you
feel
like
you
just
bit
into
an
old
gym
sock
stuffed
with
sour
apples
and
i
loved
every
second
of
it
mouthfeel
was
effervescent
immediately
but
faded
toward
the
end
medium
to
light
bodied
d
used
to
be
my
favorite
gueuze
until
i
have
tried
many
others
but
still
top
notch
very
easy
to
drink
for
the
sour
acidity
bottle
bought
at
city
wide
in
south
bend
pours
a
clear
straw
color
with
a
bubbly
dusting
of
a
head
looks
quite
effervescent
smells
massively
sour
also
has
a
horseiness
and
overripe
citrus
in
the
nose
taste
is
a
sinus
clearing
sourness
at
first
nice
clean
malt
backbone
comes
through
fast
afterwards
sourness
becomes
a
stablehay
flavor
and
is
less
intense
after
a
couple
of
sips
delicate
but
complex
flavor
with
pineapple
and
grapefruit
notes
very
tasty
medium
bodied
and
clean
feel
not
as
bubbly
in
the
mouth
as
it
looks
top
notch
very
clean
and
tasty
while
also
feeling
earthy
and
oldworld
very
nice
beer
i
enjoyed
this
mouthfeeldrinkability
microbubbles
that
smooth
out
further
into
the
swallow
its
easy
and
a
great
beer
to
start
things
off
one
of
my
all
time
favorite
aperitif
choices
and
always
a
conversation
starter
at
gatherings
drinkability
i
always
believe
these
things
are
going
to
be
way
tarter
than
they
really
are
and
i
always
find
myself
enjoying
them
extremely
i
actually
liked
this
gueuze
much
better
than
the
girardin
gueuze
1882
black
label
unfiltered
i
thought
it
was
much
less
sour
and
way
easier
drinking
d
hard
to
finish
this
one
even
for
a
geuze
its
too
much
nothing
subtle
i
wonder
why
the
bottle
is
so
big
try
as
i
might
to
be
fair
about
this
style
it
was
simply
an
awful
experience
but
one
i
felt
i
must
try
since
i
never
shy
away
from
tasting
something
new
this
was
my
first
experience
with
the
gueuze
style
clearly
it
takes
someone
with
a
niche
palate
and
a
strong
control
of
the
gag
reflex
to
appreciate
this
stuff
i
am
not
wussy
enough
to
avoid
it
and
will
try
to
find
something
that
is
more
palatable
in
the
future
but
glossing
it
over
with
charming
adjectives
isnt
gonna
work
the
words
chicken
coop
shit
came
to
mind
the
minute
it
was
presented
and
i
took
a
wiff
at
a
very
special
bar
in
brookline
mass
called
publick
house
and
monks
cell
the
barnyard
nastiness
continued
in
the
taste
but
it
was
exacerbated
by
the
blended
sour
brew
that
was
part
of
the
blend
of
this
beer
the
belgian
sour
in
and
of
itself
takes
a
great
deal
to
get
used
to
if
youve
never
experienced
a
rauchbier
then
youre
in
for
a
double
wammy
when
you
taste
this
concoction
funky
is
being
kind
avoid
this
style
if
you
want
to
avoid
losing
your
dinner
or
if
youve
never
come
close
to
similiar
flavors
in
your
belgian
experience
before
like
i
said
ill
explore
the
gueze
style
again
but
i
will
proceed
with
extreme
caution
before
doing
so
nasty
nasty
stuff
the
beer
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
nice
pale
malt
scent
that
is
completely
soured
very
nice
its
so
tart
it
makes
my
toes
curl
the
taste
is
awesome
this
is
the
most
sour
beer
ive
ever
tried
the
recipe
is
basicpale
malt
and
lambic
yeast
there
is
no
hop
character
at
all
it
has
a
woody
component
to
it
that
really
comes
through
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
lowmedium
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
kick
ass
beer
it
makes
my
face
pucker
after
even
the
tiniest
sip
highly
recommended

a
sipper

the

an
amazing
style
this
one
lives
up
to

amazing
is
the
modest
price
all
things
considered
a
winner
pours
a
hazy
orange

that
fades
to

smells
pretty
typical
for
a
wellmade
gueuze
sour
acetic
metallic

taste
is
similar
with
a
quick

almost
like

while
not
the
most
drinkable
gueuze
because
of
the
high
acidic
flavor
it
is
one
of
the
best
sipping
gueuze
i
have
been
drinking
for
years
and
at
8
99
a
bottle
in
my
opinion
a
better
value
than
an
other
gueuze
on
the
market
d
my
first
gueuze
but
certainly
not
my
last
it
will
be
awhile
before
i
try
another
one
however
ddurian
if
that
makes
any
sense
the
smell
reminds
me
of
a
certain
type
of
fecal
matter
but
the
taste
is
great
as
they
say
smells
like
chit
tastes
like
heaven
i
love
extremely
sour
beers
and
this
is
one
of
the
most
intense
guezes
i
have
had
thumbs
up
drinkability
is
very
high
for
a
sour
i
could
probably
drink
a
whole
750
but
i
think
it
would
be
a
sin
to
hoard
such
a
wonderful
beer
experience
beersperience
if
you
see
any
old
style
bottles
with
rusty
cages
and
torn
up
labels
pick
them
up
because
this
is
an
awesome
beer
i
hope
to
be
able
to
keep
my
paws
off
of
the

youre
in

sour
beers
this
gueuze
should
be
extremely
easy
to
drink
what
a
beer
perfect
for
a
warm
summer
day
one
bottle
is
not
enough
hugely
sour
when
i
taste
it
as
well
the
vinegar
aspect
is
a
bit
visceral
as
well
as
in
the
aroma
its
a
little
unpleasant
actually
but
ill
chalk
it
up
to
less
than
excellent
keeping
which
i
have
accused
before
of
the
establishment
where
i
bought
this
very
nice
geuze
taste
is
complex
but
subtle
compared
to
some
others
of
the
style
well
crafted
and
a
good
representation
of
the
geuze
definitely
get
this
if
your
love
belgian
lambic
beers
this
beer
is
a
nice
representation
of
a
gueuze
tons
of
flavor
matched
with
a
sourness
found
in
only
the
best
it
is
very
champagne
like
in
character
and
oh
so
enjoyable
i
would
love
to
toast
with
this
on
a
special
occasion
or
pop
a
few
open
with
some
friends
paired
with
some
goat
cheese
and
crusty
bread
this
is
a
classic
example
of
a
nice
gueuze
it
doesnt
stray
much
from
what
youd
expect
its
got
the
perfect
sourness
and
it
keeps
you
drinking
it
to
the
last
drop
highly
recommended
d
ok
i
would
have
this
again
for
sure
but
its
not
a
session
brew
by
any
means
i
like
this
as
a
slow
sipping
beer
as
long
as
i
just
take
tiny
sips
i
could
drink
this
all
night
but
i
couldnt
drink
it
fast
enough
to
call
it
a
session
ill
be
revisiting
this
one
for
sure
poured
out
of
a
12
7oz
corked
bottle
appearance
is
pretty
average
nothing
special
i
find
its
very
uncommon
that
a
beers
appearance
stands
out
from
the
pack
anyway
with
a
slight
chill
haze
and
plenty
of
bubbles
stuck
to
the
side
of
the
glass
color
is
darkish
straw
and
head
rapidly
retreats
to
a
small
ring
the
smell
is
full
of
the
wonderful
puckering
tartness
that
makes
this
style
just
so
wonderfully
wonderful
and
is
balanced
with
a
nice
mustardy
spicey
malt
the
taste
of
this
just
what
the
smell
would
lend
me
to
expect
full
of
lipcringing
tartness
that
rides
all
the
way
along
the
roof
of
your
mouth
tingling
your
senses
and
revealing
levels
of
that
dry
white
wine
essence
with
fruits
and
esthers
and
other
unknown
flavors
this
beer
remains
very
mysterious
to
me
although
i
have
to
admit
i
really
just
want
to
drink
more
of
it
mouthfeel
is
dry
well
carbonated
and
drinkable
what
else
can
i
say
i
just
want
to
stop
writing
this
review
and
drink
some
more
of
this
a
white
sticky
head
sits
a
top
a
yellow
body
that
provides
nice
carbonation
the
nose
is
full
of
barnyard
smells
with
a
faint
hint
of
lemon
and
grass
also
very
apparent
in
the
nose
and
taste
is
notes
of
vinegar
which
ive
never
noticed
as
bluntly
in
a
gueuze
before
the
taste
is
also
full
of
tart
sour
notes
as
you
drink
this
beer
your
cheeks
pucker
and
it
has
a
very
refreshing
feel
to
it
a
very
nice
beer
that
would
lend
itself
to
a
hot
summer
day
d
matched
well
with
the
belgian
style
mussels
that
i
had
it
with
but
not
a
beer
i
would
drink
in
large
quantities
by
itself
cheers
poured
from
a
small
corked
and
caged
bottle
into
a
slender
cylinder
glass
beautiful
golden
orangeish
straw
color
with
some
noticeable
bubbly
carbonation
only
a
small
amount
of
fizzy
head
appears
around
the
edges
smells
like
extra
funky
apple
cider
champagne
all
sorts
of
weird
and
wild
barnyard
aromas
too
such
as
straw
mud
dirty
floor
crispy
and
fresh
mouthfeel
again
champagnelike
this
tastes
like
delicious
sour
tart
apples
and
green
grapes
kind
of
like
a
nice
semidrysweet
bubbly
white
wine
but
with
some
light
dry
malt
and
grain
presence
at
the
end
this
is
my
new
champagne
very
drinkable
as
well
i
would
recommend
this
be
enjoyed
with
some
artisan
cheese
and
a
nice
fresh
crispy
baguette
this
is
my
first
gueze
so
you
may
want
to
take
this
review
with
a
grain
of
salt
the
smell
is
very
different
and
somewhat
offputting
but
i
heard
that
is
typical
for
the
style
so
i
gave
an
average
rating
the
taste
was
okay
a
bit
rancid
full
of
tart
lemon
peel
the
one
thing
i
do
like
about
this
is
the
tartness
and
the
sourness
i
have
been
wanting
to
try
something
different
and
tart
and
this
one
certainly
fit
the
bill
glad
i
tried
it
maybe
i
will
grow
to
like
this
style
better
i
have
four
more
bottles
in
the
fridge
d
this
was
really
what
i
was
looking
for
the
coffee
i
had
earlier
really
dried
me
out
this
was
refreshing
and
hit
the
spot
very
interesting
and
recommended
for
those
times
when
youre
looking
for
something
different
drinkability
sour
and
funky
but
delicious
mouthfeel
is
medium
i
hesitate
to
call
it
clean
although
there
are
no
identifiable
defects
or
anything
ungueuzelike
a
bit
of
an
acidic
bite
sort
of
aspiriny
a
little
chardonnay
not
as
extreme
as
others
there
are
better
examples
of
the
style
but
quite
drinkable
its
an
okie
dokie
not
great
one
for
me
i
either
want
more
fruit
tones
or
more
puckerness
poured
out
a
reddish
brown
into
my
glass
with
a
decent
white
head
nose
gives
off
sour
cherry
raisins
and
sherry
taste
is
mucht
the
same
but
the
sourness
is
way
shrper
on
the
palate
i
get
sour
cherry
strawberry
curry
prune
date
and
believe
it
or
not
a
flavor
that
reminds
me
of
buffalo
chickrn
has
a
sharp
mouthfeel
but
a
clean
finish
not
my
favorite
in
the
style
but
still
anout
of
a
dirty
sock
to
make
fans
happy
i
have
heard
that
hanssens
is
the
mildest
and
most
accessible
of
the
gueuzes
i
tend
to
agree
additional
info
im
sure
this
is
spot
on
for
the
style
but
this
was
my
first
try
at
the
style
i
didnt
seem
to
care
for
oud
bruins
the
first
time
i
tried
them
but
i
love
them
now
so
even
though
this
wont
be
given
high
scores
from
me
i
definately
think
its
worth
trying
and
i
will
be
trying
it
again
hopefully
enjoying
then
750
ml
corked
and
bailed
bottle
drinkability
one
bottle
is
tough
to
do
by
yourself
but
i
will
be
picking
up
another
if
i
find
one
the
6
abv
sneaks
up
on
you
d
this
was
gone
very
quickly
difficult
to
put
the
glass
down
excellent
beer
poured
from
a
small
corked
bottle
pours
a
very
clean
orangey
color
with
a
moderate
head
that
goes
down
to
a
film
smell
is
a
combo
of
sweet
malt
and
lambic
barnyard
funk
the
taste
is
very
good
the
first
to
hit
you
is
the
sweetness
of
the
wheat
malt
accented
by
lively
carbination
followed
by
a
great
puckering
sourness
a
dry
finish
but
not
as
dry
as
some
other
gueuzes
the
mouthfeel
is
really
good
with
the
carbination
bubbling
on
the
tounge
as
the
mouth
puckers
around
it
if
you
like
gueuze
this
is
very
drinkable
dynamic
beer
i
recommend
it
taste
is
dry
crispy
mouthfeel
very
complex
with
farm
like
flavors
that
come
out
apples
are
very
present
with
notes
of
cidre
followed
by
shy
spice
and
pepper
with
a
shy
hoppy
presence
i
would
have
more
after
having
some
more
experience
with
the
more
sour
styles
i
could
appreciate
it
much
more
clear
light
copper
in
colour
with
practically
no
carbonation
mild
aromas
of
very
sour
granny
smith
apples
mozzarella
cheese
and
a
bit
of
barnyard
sharp
but
not
overwhelming
acidity
a
bit
more
sour
apple
in
the
mouth
along
with
a
note
of
pear
and
wet
hay
there
was
also
a
bit
of
a
woody
note
that
revealed
itself
as
the
beer
warmed
up
very
drinkable
but
lacking
a
bit
of
complexity
strong
tartness
that
sticks
to
your
teeth
fiercely
sour
and
slightly
drying
in
the
finish
the
barest
hints
of
apple
sweetness
and
cheesy
funkiness
very
drinkable
and
a
very
good
gueuze
poured
a
clouded
copper
orange
with
light
ruby
hue
lots
of
tiny
bubbles
attach
the
to
the
side
of
my
tulip
stem
glass
great
lively
carbonation
aroma
filled
the
room
with
smell
of
over
ripened
fruit
and
slight
outdoorsy
funk
as
if
sitting
in
an
orchard
at
fall
time
a
mutlilayered
finish
first
very
weet
then
tart
finally
just
plain
sour
a
clearly
cut
3
level
mouthfeel
aroma
of
rotting
fruit
though
more
pleasant
than
it
sounds
i
would
say
most
closely
resembled
apricot
pear
and
apple
very
complete
mouthfeel
a
sugary
roundabout
finish
carbonation
high
but
very
controlled
leaves
a
sticky
feeling
on
your
teeth
a
winelike
flavour
carbonation
makes
it
sweet
reminiscent
of
champagne
flavour
slightly
void
and
yeasty
diminishes
quickly
and
youre
left
with
not
much
else
but
overripe
tartness
really
not
much
taste
but
tons
of
tartness
lick
your
lips
you
get
a
sour
sensation
as
if
you
had
eaten
lots
of
candy
sorta
burns
a
hole
in
the
back
of
your
throat
as
the
sourness
floats
around
your
gums
adapted
a
ciderlike
complex
as
it
warmed
pretty
fun
a
good
brew
im
shocked
this
is
a
fine
gueuze
full
of
funk
very
highly
recommended
especially
if
youre
a
gueuze
head
an
experience
in
a
bottle
and
much
more
about
how
it
makes
your
mouth
and
nose
feel
then
its
particular
taste
or
aroma
to
drink
a
gueze
like
this
is
to
remind
oneself
to
fill
their
life
with
vitality
and
ardor
am
i
missing
something
perhaps
our
bottle
was
not
representational
of
the
universallyknown
greatness
of
this
beer
i
would
like
to
try
this
again
but
only
because
others
seem
to
have
enjoyed
it
so
much
orange
diminishing
head
deep
aroma
of
peach
cobbler
salmon
wet
wood
grapefruit
red
apple
flies
mold
cheese
and
horseblanket
devastatingly
horsey
funky
and
just
plain
sour
harsh
as
hell
a
definate
teeth
cleaner
flavor
seems
to
lean
towards
the
grapefruitlemon
side
of
things
but
it
is
fairly
complex
and
definately
enjoyable
i
know
this
is
an
acquired
taste
but
i
thought
my
palate
was
getting
pretty
mature
i
could
handle
even
kind
of
like
those
first
two
but
i
just
cant
see
why
rotting
produce
horse
blankets
and
vomit
are
appealing
characteristics
maybe
ill
revisit
this
style
but
i
need
to
give
my
mouth
some
time
to
regain
faith
in
beer
and
humanity
every
tongue
has
its
breaking
point
it
just
so
turns
out
that
mine
is
gueuze
you
win
this
time
belgium
but
you
havent
heard
the
last
of
me
this
is
not
as
harshly
sour
as
some
of
the
cantillon
lambics
ive
had
or
perhaps
it
is
the
sweetness
that
balances
this
beer
maybe
it
is
age
as
there
is
no
date
on
this
beer
patches
of
dirt
and
funk
carbonation
fades
quickly
and
this
is
relatively
mild
in
its
sourness
this
is
way
too
balanced
to
not
be
drinkable
ya
gotta
getta
geuze
seriously
pale
golden
appearance
slightly
hazy
but
uniform
and
bright
middling
head
flat
and
pale
spreads
out
in
an
open
chalice
minimal
lacing
some
small
marks
and
dots
very
tart
aroma
quite
astringent
without
the
cheesiness
of
some
light
body
and
plenty
of
active
fizziness
good
puckering
flavor
qualities
slicing
acidity
and
sourness
moderate
sense
of
brett
for
me
i
kind
of
missed
a
bit
more
yeastiness
in
this
bottle
still
no
sweet
pretender
to
the
style
nice
and
inyourface
overall
hmmm
so
this
is
gueuze
and
the
first
real
lambic
ive
had
375
ml
bottle
corked
and
caged
with
no
freshness
date
but
its
aged
for
three
years
before
they
even
distribute
it
so
not
sure
how
much
it
matters
pours
a
fairly
clear
gold
with
1
inch
of
off
white
head
that
tries
to
lace
the
flute
smells
of
various
plants
and
animals
dung
leather
rotting
fruit
mustiness
and
other
qualities
i
cant
name
just
from
the
aroma
you
can
visualize
the
fields
and
musty
barns
that
must
be
near
the
brewery
it
has
a
medium
body
that
is
quite
dry
and
tingly
staying
carbonated
forever
the
flavor
is
sour
musty
tart
with
an
acidic
bitterness
and
some
of
the
aromas
scents
coming
through
but
none
of
the
sweetness
that
it
may
have
hinted
at
and
few
if
any
hops
an
interesting
style
but
the
pronounced
sourness
lowers
the
drinkability
for
me
though
i
would
imagine
its
more
drinkable
when
balanced
by
sweetness
as
in
fruit
lambics
i
will
however
keep
looking
for
other
examples
of
the
style
this
brew
pours
a
hazy
red
color
with
orange
hues
the
head
is
vey
small
and
recedes
within
seconds
there
is
little
lacing
the
aroma
is
sour
and
tart
with
cherries
peaking
through
the
taste
is
tart
then
sour
then
tart
again
the
aftertaste
is
very
pleasing
and
pleasant
it
is
tart
and
flavorful
but
not
overpowering
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
juicy
and
has
low
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
i
would
most
certainly
drink
this
again
the
cork
pops
out
in
a
snap
and
the
beer
overflows
the
pour
is
a
hazy
peach
tinged
amber
there
was
a
14
inch
white
head
for
about
five
seconds
this
review
is
brought
to
you
by
the
word
funk
massive
aroma
of
vinegar
lemon
barnyard
and
cider
in
your
face
sourness
and
tartness
fill
the
palate
and
i
swear
i
found
malty
sweetness
in
here
at
some
point
ive
only
had
one
other
lambic
so
i
dont
really
have
a
point
of
comparison
but
this
tastes
pretty
damn
good
overall
my
first
gueuze
and
im
ready
to
try
some
more
im
knocking
it
down
on
drinkability
because
theres
no
way
i
could
finish
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
night
but
its
a
great
changeup
from
the
stouts
and
pale
ales
ive
been
drinking
33
cl
punted
green
bottle
corked
and
caged
golden
amber
orange
with
a
sticky
fluffy
head
that
soon
becomes
a
thin
cap
aroma
is
of
tart
apples
horse
barn
grass
somewhat
reminiscent
of
a
dry
white
wine
the
taste
is
dry
farmy
and
acidic
a
very
dry
fruitiness

5i
used
this
beer
as
my
packing
companion
for
my
first
its
all
about
the
beer
trip
my
2004
belgium
trip
for
the
belgian
beer
paradise
in
brussels
what
a
sendoff
taste
good
carbonation
and
acidity
but
lacks
a
little
of
the
punch
ive
had
in
other
examples
of
the
style
the
finish
seemed
a
bit
more
watery
it
was
however
quite
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
as
far
as
gueuzes
go
i
suppose
the
first
thing
that
i
notice
is
it
explodes
in
your
mouth
extremely
smooth
and
complex
so
many
flavors
keep
coming
at
you
again
more
apple
as
well
as
citrus
not
as
dry
in
the
end
as
i
expected
not
as
in
your
face
as
the
cantillion
gueuze
if
i
remember
correctly
both
seem
very
different
to
me
i
cant
wait
to
travel
to
belgium
to
sample
more
gueuze
just
like
this
i
actually
had
my
entire
house
try
this
one
before
i
had
even
tried
it
it
tastes
like
its
gone
bad
and
this
is
really
disgusting
were
the
general
consensus
so
it
goes
however
on
my
first
sip
i
was
like
whoa
the
pour
is
orangeish
with
a
little
head
the
smell
is
sour
but
not
vinegary
it
was
enough
to
intrigue
my
friends
the
taste
hmmm
it
has
this
lactic
acid
thing
going
on
coupled
with
that
sourness
that
isnt
quite
sour
as
it
goes
kind
of
round
before
finishing
off
to
a
slightly
bitter
slight
sour
aftertaste
gueze
is
definitely
an
acquired
taste
but
to
me
its
like
fruit
but
with
the
sourness
instead
of
the
sweetness
mouthfeel
is
good
not
too
much
carbonation
drinkability
is
okay
but
im
not
sure
i
could
drink
it
all
night
one
bottle
is
definitely
fine
for
me
this
is
beyond
foul
so
much
so
that
a
sense
of
endearment
develops
poured
a
hazy
cloudy
orange
with
a
white
head
that
quickly
vanished
probably
to
get
away
from
the
smell
smelled
strongly
of
nature
and
quite
sour
tasted
sweet
and
fruity
with
a
heavy
sour
component
enjoyable
feel
and
easy
to
drink
i
would
share
this
one
again
wtih
good
company
it
pours
a
hazy
orange
with
a
white
fizzy
carbonation
that
dissipates
fast
there
is
a
strong
musty
aroma
with
some
horse
blanket
smells
the
taste
starts
with
barnyard
and
horse
blanket
it
has
an
almost
mouthpuckering
sourness
it
is
funky
and
acidic
with
a
touch
of
woodiness
and
fruit
though
no
sweetness
it
finishes
with
a
musty
quality
but
it
is
refreshing
nonetheless
a
wonderful
beer
that
i
could
drink
very
often
sampled
121303
corked
and
caged
heavy
glass
bottle
unknown
vintage
the
cage
is
removed
and
the
cork
forcefully
exits
the
bottle
the
liquid
is
a
light
golden
colour
with
a
small
fizzy
head
of
white
foam
the
aromas
are
less
complex
than
most
other
guezes
i
have
sampled
and
unfortunately
the
taste
follows
suit
its
all
just
a
bit
sweet
and
bland
to
me
with
no
real
gueze
oomph
the
mouthfeel
is
spritzy
and
the
drinkability
is
nice
the
tartness
is
so
strong
that
i
drink
again
and
again
to
see
if
its
still
strong
it
is
a
lot
goes
on
in
my
mouth
each
time
i
try
so
what
can
i
say
the
mouthfeel
is
extremely
fun
its
a
beer
version
of
poptarts
and
i
mean
that
in
a
good
way
i
will
drink
this
again
and
consider
it
quite
drinkable
i
wouldnt
drink
anything
beforehand
though
its
so
tart
that
it
deserves
to
be
tried
first
to
avoid
any
preconceptions
of
the
evenings
tastes
i
urge
you
to
think
unique
when
you
prepare
to
drink
it
its
gueuze
not
beer
the
distinction
is
big
anyone
thinking
that
it
will
be
an
ale
will
be
confused
to
say
this
beer
is
drinkable
would
be
an
understatement
refreshing
in
its
citrus
and
acidic
qualities
this
is
a
great
example
of
what
a
good
bottle
of
gueuze
becomes
after
some
deliberate
ageing
really
great
stuff
this
beer
is
a
large
reason
why
search
it
out
and
try
it
and
if
you
fear
gueuze
or
dont
think
that
belgian
styles
are
all
that
grand
well
get
yourself
a
bottle
of
this
and
hell
yeah
first
time
i
ever
try
a
gueuze
pourred
a
light
beigebrown
brew
with
a
nice
head
i
can
already
smell
the
sourness
coming
out
of
my
glass
taste
is
very
sour
with
a
light
sweet
aftertaste
alcohol
is
very
subtle
with
a
medium
body
very
different
from
what
i
had
experienced
before
but
still
very
enjoyable
not
a
bad
brew
when
poured
it
had
a
bit
of
a
champagne
like
color
but
the
aroma
was
of
the
barnyard
variety
apples
and
horses
luckily
i
like
both
its
amazing
how
the
beer
doesnt
taste
like
it
smells
its
better
i
found
it
dry
with
some
sweetness
in
the
aftertaste
i
also
enjoyed
the
mouthfeel
i
thought
it
had
good
sharp
but
small
carbonation
not
a
bad
brew
but
i
can
see
where
it
could
be
offputting
to
some
pat
okay
so
this
is
a
really
good
solid
gueuze
it
poured
a
nice
light
coppery
color
and
was
cloudy
but
not
completely
dense
looking
it
had
a
nice
head
but
not
all
that
big
upon
the
pouring
there
was
the
very
clearly
gueuze
smell
which
was
present
the
funky
yeasty
barnyardiness
was
there
the
flavor
was
nice
and
tart
as
it
should
be
it
had
very
small
champagne
like
bubbles
they
were
rather
gentle
feeling
this
was
quite
tasty
with
a
nice
mild
yeastiness
to
it
if
you
like
this
one
and
can
still
find
oude
bersels
oude
ville
gueuze
i
hope
i
remembered
that
right
go
out
and
try
that
one
too
before
it
is
gone
so
this
is
what
a
gueuze
is
my
first
i
can
say
that
i
liked
it
but
i
dont
really
know
if
its
my
style
smell
is
uh
sourkraut
tastes
a
lot
like
champagne
but
with
more
of
an
earthy
yeasty
flavor
to
it
very
tart
and
somewhat
sour
but
it
seems
like
the
sour
flavor
is
held
back
a
little
and
cant
quite
come
out
all
the
way
finish
is
super
dry
a
good
beer
to
have
but
only
on
certain
occassions
clear
golden
color
fluffy
white
meringue
light
head
with
good
retention
aroma
is
lemongrass
acetic
acid
horse
blanket
and
must
this
ones
got
some
acidity
to
it
a
little
more
harsh
and
less
sweet
than
their
kriek
it
still
doesnt
compare
to
the
mouth
puckering
ability
of
cantillon
though
i
like
the
lemon
grass
quality
and
barnyard
aspects
vinegar
like
stinging
leaves
a
dry
lingering
aftertaste
carbonation
is
lively
and
body
about
medium
yeah
this
is
a
solid
gueuze
drinkability
a
world
class
gueze
my
favorite
is
still
drie
fonteinen
but
this
one
is
a
classic
nontheless
hazy
goldenorange
with
a
good
initial
head
that
vanishes
fairly
quickly
to
a
winelike
appearance
aromas
are
nice
and
citrusy
and
very
cheesy
with
a
dose
of
old
wood
if
you
like
funky
chese
youll
like
this
no
doubt
the
taste
is
refreshing
and
much
like
drinking
pure
grapefruit
juicenice
and
sour
with
ample
bitterit
grows
on
you
as
you
sip
it
nice
one
to
have
while
preparing
dinner
a
tasty
sour
for
any
tart
overall
drinkability
on
this
beer
is
excellent
as
i
stated
before
this
is
my
first
gueuze
experience
and
i
can
see
how
some
people
would
be
turned
off
by
the
sourness
and
tart
flavor
but
all
i
can
say
is
i
really
want
to
try
more
gueuze
style
brews
asap
to
see
if
something
else
might
be
even
better
mouthfeel
light
bodied
citric
consistently
the
most
balanced
of
the
gueuzes
has
a
wonderful
subtle
for
a
gueuze
citrusy
acidity
quite
complex
with
changing
notes
of
barnyard
oak
and
a
funky
mushroom
type
flavor
the
beer
is
quite
dry
but
still
has
a
subtle
sweetness
that
adds
to
the
overall
aroma
musty
and
sour
with
hints
of
enteric
at
first
it
is
sourly
citrusy
then
the
mustiness
and
enteric
comes
through
there
is
almost
a
hint
of
orange
in
the
taste
it
finishes
with
a
bit
of
astringency
think
of
black
tea
this
is
total
sour
candy
one
of
my
alltime
faves
for
sure
really
could
use
a
bit
more
carbonation
to
lighten
the
initial
palate
and
provide
some
more
balance
and
even
more
length
very
drinkable
my
personal
choice
is
still
cantillon
but
this
comes
close
thanks
to
hanssens
for
continuing
to
produce
this
gem
honey
orange
color
aroma
is
vinous
barnyardish
with
a
touch
of
cheese
a
medium
bodied
gueuze
sour
and
tart
while
also
fruity
and
sweet
it
initially
very
sour
and
tart
but
gives
way
to
a
sour
fruitiness
apples
peaches
and
cherries
vinous
and
barnyardy
nice
gueuze
mouthfeel
is
full
and
round
finish
is
very
dry

is
tart
cork
smells
of
wild
lemon
zest
with
some
sweetness
gold
yellow
look
with
some
haze
and
a
fluffy
white
sticky
head
on
the
pour
out
of
the
green
glass
active
bubbles
in
the
goblet
weet
old
gym
bag
smell
with
some
bitterness
acidic
in
the
sinus
very
good
lookin
in
the
goblet
feel
the
explosion
sting
of
taste
on
your
first
sip
upfront
taste
of
fruity
wild
yeasts
surround
your
tongue
this
is
then
kicked
up
a
notch
by
lemon
bitterness
there
is
a
slight
mellow
sweetness
in
the
finish
as
you
continue
to
sip
the
the
inital
sting
dissapates
and
your
tongue
snuggles
up
to
it
like
your
two
year
old
just
daughter
just
before
bed
time
musty
fruity
sweet
and
rounded
very
dry
tart
white
grape
tinted
softish
medium
lively

a
crafted
beer
i
could
not
drink
this
beer
all
night
due
to
its
dry
nature
i
must
admit
that
this
was
my
first
nonfruity
lambic
thanks
to
kluk
for
this
bottle
poured
a
hazy
orangegolden
this
beer
simply
looks
sour
smell
is
funky
and
reminds
me
of
old
gym
socks
and
my
old
summer
job
at
the
horse
ranch
interesting
taste
is
over
the
top
sour
after
i
got
used
to
it
i
really
liked
it
lemony
sour
but
also
appley
and
very
acidic
methinks
this
is
a
good
introduction
to
this
untamed
style
of
beer
highly
recommended
750
ml
gree
bottle
with
sb
07
on
cork
pours
a
golden
yellow
with
a
good
head
that
recedes
quickly
to
a
fine
line
very
fine
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
is
of
over
ripe
grapes
and
apples
sour
and
musty
the
taste
is
like
whoa
sour
apple
pucker
factor
saliva
glands
kick
into
overdrive
knees
start
to
buckle
eyes
cross
and
just
when
you
think
please
no
more
some
cloying
sweetness
creeps
in
for
the
finish
almost
but
not
quite
like
drinking
champagne
very
enjoyable
hanssens
has
really
been
impressing
me
ever
since
i
tried
their
oudbeitje
strawberry
lambic
very
champagnelike
both
in
appearance
and
mouthfeel
poured
a
golden
orange
color
with
a
lot
of
fine
bubbles
leaves
a
trace
of
tartness
on
the
lips
as
it
enters
the
mouth
nice
sweet
undertones
help
take
the
harshness
off
the
sour
acidity
had
a
hint
of
what
could
have
been
grass
very
dry
pours
out
an
apple
juice
gold
bronze
notes
in
the
light
pretty
foamy
large
and
lively
head
mega
musty
aromas
tart
fruits
lots
of
green
apple
notes
flavors
of
fruit
tarts
in
your
face
puckering
and
mouth
watering
you
can
faintly
make
out
the
barley
malt
base
but
with
the
queen
of
tarts
running
roughshod
all
over
your
tongue
its
hard
to
make
out
any
real
malt
flavors
fruit
flavors
run
rampant
finishes
dry
as
a
bone
clean
and
crisp
damn
snappy
i
have
limited
experience
with
lambics
or
gueze
lambics
but
i
found
this
really
tasty
and
enlivening
refreshingly
tart
im
thinking
this
would
be
a
great
warm
weather
treat
fiancee
liked
it
a
lot
too
this
lambic
poured
a
nice
golden
color
with
thin
white
foam
and
good
carbonation
the
aroma
was
tart
sour
green
apples
come
citrus
the
taste
was
very
tart
almost
sour
apples
and
musty
grapes
dominated
the
mouthfeel
was
very
tart
almost
too
tart
for
my
tastes
though
it
did
grow
on
me
there
was
good
carbonation
and
a
decent
lingering
flavor
the
drinkability
was
ok
i
am
still
not
a
big
fan
of
gueze
lambics
but
i
am
getting
to
like
them
a
little
more
each
time
i
think
this
one
would
drink
better
in
warmer
weather
one
of
the
more
beautiful
beers
ive
ever
seen
the
body
is
a
clear
amber
with
a
peachypink
tint
the
head
is
easy
forming
but
not
impossible
to
keep
under
control
it
lasts
amazingingly
well
and
sheets
the
glass
beautifully
the
aroma
is
not
overly
funky
i
pick
up
more
fresh
fruit
than
horse
blanket
but
theres
enough
there
to
make
me
think
of
being
outside
while
eating
peaches
and
smelling
the
earthiness
from
my
parents
garden
on
one
side
and
a
different
type
of
earthiness
from
the
horse
pasture
on
the
other
a
little
rotting
wood
actually
not
a
bad
smell
its
omnipresent
during
any
walk
through
the
woods
the
flavor
is
bright
and
very
tart
theirs
juicy
fruit
gum
backed
by
an
apricot
smoothie
and
organges
clementines
maybe
the
tartness
makes
this
refreshing
but
at
the
same
time
slows
you
down
while
drinking
its
almost
like
its
forcing
you
to
relax
and
enjoy
it
it
comes
in
a
375
ml
bottle
with
a
cage
and
cork
it
pours
a
somewhat
hazy
gold
with
a
hint
of
peach
the
smell
is
sour
and
acidic
and
will
curl
the
nose
hairs
the
gueuze
deal
is
growing
on
me
the
tase
is
absolutely
mouthpuckering
tart
fruit
apple
or
lemonsoaked
pear
huh
sticks
to
the
lips
and
tongue
musty
flavors
are
also
in
the
mix
next
time
i
need
to
pair
this
with
some
cheese
to
make
the
experience
even
better
hazy
peach
orange
hue
topped
by
an
initially
thick
head
that
steadily
settles
into
a
thin
layer
of
loose
froth
tart
acidic
fruit
upfront
in
aroma
gives
way
to
a
pungent
waft
of
musty
hay
and
damp
horse
blanket
mellow
hints
of
oak
and
cheesy
aged
hops
are
present
as
an
undertone
trace
note
of
meaty
and
sweaty
enteric
fermented
organic
nitrogen
assertive
nearly
pucker
inducing
lactic
tartness
seizes
the
palate
at
first
then
loosens
slightly
to
allow
expectedly
tart
notes
of
unripe
kiwi
as
well
pseudosweet
balsamic
laced
acetic
tartness
to
emerge
mild
woodiness
and
hints
of
grainy
wheat
emerge
mid
palate
adding
depth
to
the
overwhelmed
malt
character
light
in
body
with
a
spritzy
lively
mouthfeel
as
co2
dissapates
the
mouthfeel
becomes
slightly
creamier
revealing
token
residual
dextrins
finishes
dry
yet
long
with
a
grainy
bready
and
slightly
chalky
dryness
fading
into
a
lingering
but
clean
acidic
tartness
oude
gueuze
is
tremendously
refreshing
tart
and
assertive
overall
in
character
the
complex
tinge
of
mixed
acid
fermentation
from
enteric
bacteria
doesnt
go
unnoticed
while
further
aging
wont
tame
the
tartness
it
may
bring
out
the
subdued
woodiness
that
added
richness
delicious
yes
indeedy
one
bottle
of
this
caused
me
to
wake
up
with
a
headache
this
morning
i
had
to
change
the
drinkability
score
from
4
5
down
to
3
5
lovely
true
lambic
balsamic
earthy
nose
very
smelly
but
in
a
good
way
palate
was
complex
sour
earthy
balsamic
and
kind
of
reminded
me
of
a
really
good
salad
dressing
refreshing
aswell
slightly
mouth
puckering
but
well
balanced
and
for
the
most
part
dry
despite
a
hint
of
tart
sweetness
god
damn
lovely
true
hardcore
lambic
now
my
sinuses
are
clear
i
wonder
how
the
horseradish
eaters
among
us
might
like
this
great
beer
pours
a
clear
deep
golden
orangish
color
with
a
huge
bubbly
champagne
like
head
that
settles
down
eventually
smells
of
some
slight
grass
clippings
musty
basements
and
the
inside
of
a
barn
i
swear
if
you
close
your
eyes
you
would
think
you
were
in
the
cobweb
strewn
basement
where
this
is
fermented
extreme
dryness
and
some
cheek
puckering
tartness
the
only
taste
that
can
even
be
said
to
be
near
it
would
be
some
extremely
tart
apple
cider
light
on
the
tongue
and
very
refreshing
there
is
also
some
more
of
that
musty
basement
in
the
flavor
excellently
bitter
and
tart
extremely
easy
to
drink
and
extremely
tasty
i
cannot
say
enough
about
this
brew
they
say
you
either
love
gueuze
or
hate
it
count
me
as
one
of
the
first
group
this
is
one
amazingly
complex
and
awesomely
tasty
brew
a
big
thanks
to
thelongbeachbum
for
his
inspiring
gueuze
articles
and
his
excellent
recommendations
huge
on
the
rustic
barnyard
nose
with
a
hint
of
butterscotchand
this
might
sound
crazy
but
slight
cheese
on
the
nose
very
tart
pineapple
taste
with
sour
finishgood
representation
this
is
not
real
beer
however
excellent
appearance
for
a
belgian
nice
relatively
clear
brew
apple
ciderlike
flavor
with
a
subtle
whiskeylike
and
yeasty
aftertaste
notes
a
most
delicious
gueuze
and
a
fine
replacement
for
any
champagne
or
something
to
enjoy
on
a
special
occasion
i
just
love
beer
and
its
infinite
diversity
fruity
and
tart
with
a
complex
dryness
throughly
enjoyed
this
brew
with
a
cheese
and
bread
snack
in
brugge
my
first
gueuze
as
i
was
hardcore
wine
lover
started
to
drink
beer
just
half
year

i
would
advice
to
start
with
this
type
of
beers
when
you
are
planning
to
change
from
wine
to
beerway
distinctly
average
the
taste
has
a
slight
candylike
sour
lemon
mixed
with
a
light
malt
flavor
with
light
yeast
taste
which
is
a
mild
tangy
with
dried
sweet
pineapple
and
a
sweetsour
finish
overall
this
is
not
bad
just
average
as
far
as
the
style
goes
ok
to
try
i
would
advise
to
eat
it
with
something
bitter
likedark
chocolate
as
its
sweetness
can
be
quite
overwgelming
without
a
counterbalance
not
the
type
of
gueuze
that
i
like
but
not
a
horrible
beer
either
i
guess
its
a
good
introductory
one
into
the
style
did
not
score
a
t
s
m
at
that
time
disregard
those
scores
poured
into
a
chalice
this
gueuze
is
clear
light
amber
little
head
with
nice
lacing
aromas
of
weak
wild
microbial
funk
white
wine
ish
with
apple
fruitiness
taste
is
very
mild
more
like
a
juice
than
a
sour
funky
gueuze
easy
drinking
but
not
very
exciting
low
to
medium
carbonation
weak
bodied
overall
a
cheapy
o
never
had
a
geuze
like
this
before
reminds
me
of
a
faro
for
its
sweetness
i
prefer
the
sour
varieties
of
this
type
of
beer
i
picked
this
up
in
a
grocery
store
in
waterloo
i
believe
the
name
was
carfour
they
had
a
great
selection
and
the
prices
were
amazing
and
with
most
of
europe
they
let
you
break
single
out
of
the
pack
it
poured
amber
with
a
red
orange
hue
the
aroma
was
earthy
and
farm
like
it
had
a
pasture
like
taste
with
a
pleasant
sourness
the
mouthfeel
was
average
and
had
nothing
to
really
speak
of
pours
a
cloudy
orangetan
color
13
inch
head
of
a
white
color
good
retention
and
decent
lacing
smells
of
slight
alcohol
tartness
grapes
and
slight
sourness
fits
the
style
of
a
gueuze
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
strong
tartness
and
sourness
as
well
tastes
of
grapes
hint
of
sweet
malt
hint
of
pale
malt
and
strong
tartness
and
sour
flavor
overall
good
appearance
aroma
feel
and
body
poured
into
a
glass
at
a
hostelbar
in
brussels
smells
like
processed
lambic
very
bubbly
things
were
going
well
until
i
took
a
sip
and
found
it
to
be
very
sweet
i
am
sure
that
my
expectations
made
this
more
shocking
than
it
had
to
be
but
since
the
packaging
was
so
traditional
with
a
heavy
glass
bottle
and
a
belgian
style
cork
and
cage
i
figured
it
would
be
real
gueuze
it
is
not
however
and
though
i
try
not
to
hold
that
fact
against
it
i
am
disappointed
by
the
lifeless
sweetened
fizz
in
my
glass
i
wouldnt
buy
this
again
but
if
you
like
sweetened
pasteurized
gueuze
by
all
means
give
it
a
shot
a
little
cheesy
bread
and
earth
in
the
flavor
but
have
to
search
it
out
amongst
all
that
sugar
o
this
has
to
be
one
of
the
easiest
beers
in
the
style
and
would
make
for
a
good
entrylevel
beer
into
geuzes
as
the
beer
settles
on
the
palate
its
hard
not
to
revisit
the
glass
much
sooner
than
i
should
but
the
dryness
of
the
beer
leaves
me
wanting
a
quick
return
this
is
a
well
blended
sour
ale
that
offers
as
much
sultry
taste
as
it
does
refreshment
a
welcome
beer
in
my
glass
in
complement
to
any
rich
pork
dish
accompanied
by
a
bowl
of
mussels
a
feast
that
i
wont
soon
forget
thank
you
brussels
boo
ersatz
gueuze
the
real
thing
can
be
so
much
more
this
is
too
sweet
and
too
clean
filtered
and
adulterated
with
sugar
where
are
the
complex
yeasty
notes
and
the
biting
acidity
wheres
the
puckering
mouthfeel
and
the
depth
of
character
its
drinkable
enough
and
might
serve
as
an
introduction
for
someone
who
has
never
tried
lambic
before
but
otherwise
its
strictly
for
the
kids
give
it
a
miss
overall
its
a
really
easy
drinker
perhaps
a
bit
of
an
intro
to
the
style
for
joe
average
my
experience
with
the
style
is
still
limited
but
this
was
a
disappointing
beer
that
gets
an
above
average
because
it
looked
pretty
and
followed
the
style
guidelines
a
decent
but
slightly
hectic
gueuze
when
it
comes
to
balancing
out
its
body
and
flavor
not
really
an
fine
example
of
what
gueuzes
can
be
in
my
view
while
i
think
it
is
a
decent
beer
i
probably
would
not
revisit
it
for
4
euros
a
bottle
which
is
the
same
price
of
some
finer
beers
of
this
style
which
are
available
in
france
i
am
curious
to
try
the
bottled
version
now
only
for
comparisons
sake
overall
tasty
but
not
sour
enough
a
little
too
sweet
i
like
the
beer
though
a
very
disappointing
gueuze
im
not
sure
ive
had
a
worse
one
unbalanced
rather
insipid
and
not
at
all
inspiring
o
this
beer
is
far
from
what
a
gueuze
tastes
like
in
my
experience
this
is
super
sweet
and
syrupy
o
juice
with
alcohol
added
i
think
theyre
stretching
the
definition
of
the
gueuze
with
this
one
i
think
it
might
be
more
aptly
classified
as
a
wine
cooler
beer
is
sweet
and
mildly
sour
it
has
a
grainy
finish
to
it
and
overall
it
is
kind
of
gross
the
finish
is
mildly
dry
overall
i
will
never
have
this
beer
again
and
i
would
be
likely
to
avoid
this
entire
brewery
because
of
this
beer
commercialized
products
designed
for
mainstream
appeal
are
fundamental
opposites
to
the
traditional
artisan
products
of
lambic
producers
one
represents
art
creativity
personal
expression
human
scale
and
touch
the
continuity
of
culture
and
tradition
the
other
is
driven
by
marketideology
dollars
and
cents
mainstream
appeal
and
commercial
success
i
know
which
side
of
that
debate
i
stand
the
one
opposite
to
mort
subite
gueuze
i
wished
it
was
little
drier
and
less
sweeter
but
it
seem
to
have
a
good
sweetsour
taste
but
leaning
little
towards
sweet
side
nice
quenching
apply
sour
taste
but
the
mouthfeel
lets
this
down
a
bit
too
smooth
and
silky
for
my
liking
which
has
a
quick
slippy
quality
the
liquid
just
seems
too
keen
to
slide
down
your
throat
leaving
not
much
risidual
on
the
tongue
or
the
sides
of
your
mouth
still
a
bit
of
a
pleasant
surprise
though
d
easy
to
find
and
cheap
in
belgium
sadly
delicious
and
wonderful
why
must
i
fly
to
europe
for
this
drinkability
its
really
not
bad
too
sweet
and
not
all
that
interesting
minimally
sour
minimally
funky
ill
not
drink
it
again
this
has
never
been
one
of
my
favorite
gueuzes
but
can
be
pretty
satisfying
when
cold
and
youre
in
the
mood
for
a
little
something
lighter
overall
this
was
just
too
sweet
ive
heard
rumors
that
mort
subite
adds
extra
sugar
before
refermentation
but
im
not
sure
if
thats
true
my
friend
and
i
both
agreed
that
it
was
just
alright
and
i
hope
my
present
didnt
do
more
harm
than
good
this
was
my
first
geuze
interesting
if
not
a
bit
simple
where
was
the
malt
balance
is
there
supposed
to
be
one
hopefully
d
i
enjoyed
drinking
this
alcohol
seems
nonexistent
but
its
evidently
a
poor
example
due
to
the
poor
balance
between
sweet
and
sour
no
puckering
quality
in
the
mouthfeel
for
a
refreshing
note
drinkability
ok
a
bit
sweeter
than
my
anticipation
of
a
gueuze
is
probably
a
faro
in
disguise
mort
subite
pours
a
pleasant
amber
color
with
a
nice
frothy
head
the
beer
is
quite
clear
which
is
essentially
impossible
to
do
with
the
traditional
approach
sending
off
warning
flags
the
nose
has
a
vinegarlike
acidity
with
a
cider
character
minimal
symptoms
of
brettomyces
flavor
has
an
apparent
though
onedimensional
acidity
and
like
most
new
gueuzes
is
corrupted
by
the
sweetness
of
sugar
but
unlike
most
new
gueuzes
the
sweetness
does
not
lead
to
failure
here
it
actually
adds
a
nice
ciderapple
character
with
similarity
to
the
rodenbach
gran
cru
and
is
actually
pretty
well
balanced
by
the
acidity
ultimately
this
this
gives
it
a
realistic
and
refreshing
fruitiness
i
dont
hate
this
gueuze
but
i
will
not
drink
it
again
soft
and
rounded
and
fairly
drinkable
would
be
more
drinkable
without
all
the
sweetness
vintage
2004
pours
a
dirty
coppery
shade
of
yellow
aroma
is
funky
along
with
sweet
honey
and
flora
including
lilac
tastes
of
classic
belgofunk
with
a
moderate
sourness
and
pronounced
floral
character
mediun
bodied
with
a
nice
creamy
carbonation
quite
easy
to
drink
with
a
lovely
funk
to
it
i
have
had
this
beer
a
couple
times
this
bottle
was
particularly
tasty
and
so
it
would
seem
a
couple
years
in
the
bottle
definitely
makes
this
one
a
winner
i
wasnt
really
sure
how
to
score
this
as
i
did
enjoy
it
it
just
wasnt
that
exciting
or
interesting
unoffesive
and
refreshing
d
this
is
not
as
overly
acidic
and
acetic
as
many
lambics
which
gives
it
a
bit
higher
level
of
drinkability
that
said
the
flavors
were
not
outstanding
but
still
quite
enjoyable
i
had
this
as
an
aperitif
and
was
actually
tempted
to
have
another
one
despite
the
great
selection
of
other
beers
the
acidity
of
lambic
is
unique
to
here
back
but
still
very
present
it
also
feels
a
touch
of
sugar
but
it
is
also
too
light
to
take
off
the
drink
probably
use
a
fairly
young
lambic
but
unfortunately
lack
of
flavor
and
gives
a
beer
a
bit
bland
though
very
refreshing
it
appears
that
the
version
in
25cl
is
much
sweeter
than
the
version
in
37
5
cl
d
i
could
actually
drink
a
good
amount
of
this
as
it
doesnt
have
the
stomach
melting
aspects
of
some
of
the
other
beers
of
this
style
still
the
overly
sweet
element
is
a
little
offputting
as
its
not
really
want
i
want
from
this
type
of
beer
overall
this
is
a
really
nice
example
of
the
style
i
bought
it
without
checking
the
ratings
on
ba
and
was
disappointed
to
see
afterwards
that
the
bros
had
given
it
a
c
im
glad
i
picked
this
one
up
though
as
its
a
very
refreshing
subtle
gueuze
thats
definitely
worth
trying
drinkability
is
fairly
high
in
that
its
like
drinking
iced
tea
too
sugary
and
uninteresting
to
a
real
gueuze
lover
to
session
its
a
fine
kiddie

at

goblet
by
a
friendly
middle
aged
blonde
golden
almost
leaning
brown
with
a
massive
stark
white
head
despite
very
modest
carbonation
less
acidic
than
most
geuze
in
terms
of
aroma
taste
and
feel
easy
going
yet
loaded
with
character
and
quite
interesting
sourness
is
mild
this
might
be
a
good
introduction
to
the
style
for
some
biscuity
with
some
lemon
but
only
mild
baryardiness
very
drinkable
deasy
to
drink
and
pleasantly
refreshing
the
tatse
is
sweet
and
sour
a
very
nice
mix
you
can
drink
a
lot
of
a
pleasant
and
easy
drinking
gueuze
d
something
to
try
if
you
like
lambics
mouthfeel
pretty
low
carbonation
with
a
medium
body
a
bare
skim
of
foam
across
the
top
with
a
tiny
string
of
pearls
clinging
to
one
side
sweetened
iced
tea
honey
clover
and
soggy
graham

aroma
a
sweet
tartness
on
the
tongue
more
soggy
grahamsugar
cookie
medicinal
with
mild
papercardboard
around
the
edges
dry
in
the
finish
it
does
pull
the
cheeks
inward
slightly
but
nothing
approaching
a
sour
pucker
obviously
sweetened
this
was
just
plain
dull
maybe
worth
a
try
for
free
but
i
wouldnt
buy
it
if
i
saw
it
pours
a
clear
amber
with
a
decent
crème
head
nose
seems
almost
nutty
flavor
is
sweet
like
candy
with
apple
tones
basically
it
just
tastes
like
an
artificially
sweet
lambic
feel
has
a
quite
full
carbonation
liquid
is
slick
okay
to
drink
but
certainly
not
a
traditional
gueuze
by
any
means
would
be
an
excellent
choice
for
someone
wanting
to
get
their
feet
wet
in
the
world
of
lambic
however
it
is
nowhere
close
to
playing
with
the
big
boys
pours
copper
colour
with
white
head
which
stayed
for
a
while
smeel
is
fruity
apple
raspberries
honey
really
nice
taste
is
sweet
fruity
apples
are
dominating
but
its
really
complex
and
confusing
but
its
pretty
tasty
moutfeel
is
creamy
and
kinda
sparkly
very
balanced
and
pleasant
brew
i
would
definately
have
more
recieved
this
bottle
from
my
friend
stu
its
dated
back
to
2003
pours
a
pale
yellow
color
with
little
bubbles
of
carbonation
smell
is
sweet
fruit
with
a
little
bit
of
barnyard
funkiness
in
the
nose
taste
is
very
sour
this
is
littely
like
tasting
some
old
sweet
tarts
that
have
been
sitting
in
the
sun
a
bit
to
long
tart
apple
and
pear
overall
this
was
pretty
good
i
am
sure
the
age
of
this
beer
had
aa
great
affect
on
it
turning
it
much
sour
that
it
was
before
i
might
say
this
is
a
gueuze
for
beginners
the
aroma
has
moderate
belgian
funkwith
sweet
malts
in
the
background
its
surprisingly
sweet
with
a
honey
like
flavor
that
blends
fairly
nicely
with
the
mellow
barnyard
elements
horse
blanket
and
hay
theres
also
a
bit
of
fruit
in
the
flavor
with
white
grape
and
lemon
the
appearance
is
a
deep
clear
gold
and
a
touch
of
lacing
i
actually
checked
the
label
to
make
sure
i
didnt
get
a
fruit
lambic
but
this
is
still
a
nice
and
interesting
beer
just
not
a
great
gueuze
only
the
sweetness
and
possibly
offflavor
phenolic
notes
detract
slightly
from
drinkability
i
gladly
had
two
bottles
of
this
with
an
acceptablyprepared
serving
of
moules
frites
for
the
purposes
of
introducing
newcomers
to
lambic
this
isnt
so
bad
overall
i
have
few
complaints
but
it
just
doesnt
sit
right
in
my
mouth
i
didnt
find
it
exceptional
and
i
doubt
that
id
ever
buy
another
of
this
brand
at
least
anyway
refreshing
and
i
dont
mind
to
have
a
couple
of
them
a
lower
alcohol
break
in
the
midst
of
a
meal
at
belgo
centraal
in
london
it
is
a
light
gold
copper
with
no
head
but
great
lacing
not
sure
how
that
works
but
more
power
to
them
the
smell
has
a
hint
of
sourness
honey
and
a
light
floral
note
the
taste
is
tart
apples
lightly
sweet
with
a
dry
finish
it
has
a
light
body
is
lightly
carbonated
and
slightly
silky
the
drinkability
is
the
beers
strong
suit
it
is
a
great
starter
beer
for
those
interested
in
the
more
unusual
belgians
very
drinkable
but
one
very
slight
off
flavor
still
very
good
though
ive
never
had
a
gueuze
before
so
i
thought
it
was
about
time
being
a
fan
of
the
sour
side
of
the
sense
of
taste
popping
off
the
wireencased
champagnestyle
cork
i
got
a
good
whiff
of
a
nice
sourfruit
aroma
wafting
out
of
the
bottle
and
was
happy
that
the
beer
didnt
come
spewing
out
at
the
same
time
in
the
glass
this
lambic
appeared
a
light
golden
colour
with
a
reddish
tint
and
produced
a
few
fingers
of
puffy
white
head
the
smell
was
very
tart
fruit
like
cherry
or
kiwi
accompanied
by
a
mellow
sweetness
the
taste
likewise
was
well
balanced
between
the
tart
fruit
and
the
light
malty
sweetness
although
the
carbonation
was
a
bit
on
the
high
side
the
first
few
sips
were
quite
intense
but
after
breaking
in
the
taste
buds
the
remainder
of
the
bottle
went
down
quite
smoothly
not
something
id
want
to
have
in
a
large
quantity
over
the
course
of
an
evening
but
quite
interesting
and
flavourful
if
you
like
sour
fruit
for
a
round
or
two
all
in
all
a
very
enjoyable
gueuze
in
fact
a
great
entrance
for
people
into
the
style
and
to
possibly
work
their
way
up
to
the
real
lip
puckering
offerings
of
this
style
if
your
gut

gueuze

je
préfére
la
gueuze
tradition
very
smooth
subtly
lambic
hard
to
find
in
the
usa
but
worth
seeking
out
popping
the
cork
on
this
gueuze
gives
a
nice
subtle
hint
of
cherries
and
light
fruit
perhaps
mandarin
orange
and
nectarine
mort
subite
pours
into
my
glass
a
pale
somewhat
hazy
peach
colourquite
attractive
with
these
plus
30
heat
waves
in
alberta
right
now
the
aroma
is
subtle
as
well
nothing
is
fullon
here
what
we
get
is
some
light
fruit
notes
the
slightest
of
some
tart
yeasty
esters
and
a
dryish
airy
nose
nothing
terribly
out
of
the
ordinary
but
rating
in
style
this
is
a
very
refreshing
and
appetising
aroma
the
taste
is
much
the
same
but
even
less
tart
or
sweet
than
the
aroma
leads
you
to
expect
very
light
cherries
or
peaches
and
a
little
light
malting
plus
a
satisfying
tartness
which
is
quite
subtle
again
the
beer
is
tasty
and
refreshingthere
simply
isnt
much
to
describe
about
it
it
works
well
and
has
a
light
refreshing
body
and
plenty
of
drinkability
i
cant
complain
it
fits
the
style
and
satisfied
my
thirst
for
a
subtle
tart
lambic
if
i
must
say
something
positive
thier
kriek
is
slightly
better
now
i
must
go
to
the
basement
and
get
some
boon
and
or
cantillon
and
get
this
sugary
taste
out
of
my
mouth
mouthfeel
is
slick
and
smooth
and
though
it
feels
like
the
carbonation
is
lively
it
is
easy
on
the
tongue
easy
drinking
enough
that
you
could
serve
this
to
just
about
anyone
but
lacking
in
intensity
in
the
flavours
a
lambic
without
the
cheek
sucking
sourness
i
liked
it
drinkability
i
like
this
beer
but
hardcore
gueuze
purists
might
scoff
at
it
but
because
this
one
is
more
mellow
and
wellrounded
i
think
it
would
be
more
versatile
in
food
pairings
im
thinking
it
would
make
a
good
substitute
for
a
german
white
wine
sampled
at
au
bon
vieux
temps
in
brussels
the
bottle
was
much
like
the
one
pictured
here
it
poured
a
clear
very
pale
copper
under
a
one
finger
offwhite
head
with
good
retention
and
great
sheets
of
lace
the
nose
was
very
mild
with
a
hint
of
fruit
and
spice
the
mouth
was
wellcarbonated
and
light
despite
the
tartness
strong
raspberry
flavor
joined
by
some
bready
malt
no
hopes
were
noticeable
the
aftertaste
was
short
and
tart
perhaps
a
bit
too
tangy
for
my
beer
taste
it
was
nevertheless
quite
tasty
carbonationheavy
but
very
enjoyable
a
must
for
champagne
and
cider
fans
drinkability
toned
down
and
easy
to
drink
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
this
beer
has
a
very
light
amber
hue
the
head
eventually
dissipates
but
leaves
nice
laces
around
the
glass
it
has
nice
carbonation
the
bubbles
are
rising
very
quickly
towards
the
surface
kind
of
like
champagne
smells
and
tastes
of
green
apple
pickles
sour
candies
cider
vinegar
lemon
and
ripe
cheese
this
is
sweeter
than
another
version
i
have
had
of
this
style
i
think
they
added
candi
sugar
to
it
kind
of
like
they
do
with
faro
i
find
this
beer
light
bodied
and
realitively
easy
to
drink
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
style
but
i
rather
enjoyed
this
one
this
one
is
good
enough
to
drink
and
much
easier
to
drink
than
the
authentic
lambics
its
a
tradeoff
if
you
dont
want
to
work
this
is
a
good
one
but
it
isnt
as
interesting
as
some
others
this
stuff
is
quite
nice
id
have
it
again
overall
quite
different
than
some
other
beers
of
this
style
that
i
have
had
i
really
enjoyed
this
bottle
very
refreshing
pours
bubbly
yellow
with
thin
cm
or
so
but
lingering
head
smells
sweet
to
be
concise
it
is
thin
unsuprising
but
tasty
on
first
sip
i
would
almost
class
it
as
some
kind
of
session
lambic
as
it
is
flavourful
yet
not
wild
and
with
very
little
aftertaste
afterwards
not
dissappointed
that
i
bought
it
but
usually
expect
more
from
a
lambic
the
colouration
ie
the
clarity
does
lend
thoughts
towards
filtration
however
espescially
for
a
gueuze
combo
of
young
and
old
brews
it
would
be
hard
to
argue
for
this
happening
naturally
but
then
again
im
no
expert
apple
sweetness
with
a
hint
of
tartness
near
the
finish
light
refreshing
mouthfeel
with
a
medium
carbonation
has
hints
of
some
sour
but
its
washed
away
with
a
cidery
sweetness
colour
on
this
beer
is
a
tawny
red
with
a
thin
head
made
of
large
weak
bubbles
sweet
and
sour
smell
cherries
malt
and
farm
smell
not
impressed
with
the
taste
to
me
it
tasted
like
sour
mike
ikes
no
other
character
mouthfeel
was
dry
not
drinkable
i
like
sour
hard
candy
but
not
in
liquid
form
overall
a
girlie
beer
good
as
an
appetizer
if
you
like
geuze
lambics
this
is
the
one
for
you
d
pretty
good
the
sourness
and
sweetness
matches
well
easy
to
drink
and
refreshing
pours
a
clear
amber
generous
off
white
head
forms
some
real
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
decent
retention
smell
is
nice
and
funky
sweet
and
sour
some
citrus
spice
barnyard
and
yeast
taste
is
citrus
with
sour
iron
sugar
sweetness
some
caramel
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
not
a
great
gueuze
but
really
not
bad
very
refreshing
seems
too
over
processed
to
me
from
the
main
stream
lambic
gueuze
perhaps
an
entry
level
blended
and
sweetened
lambic
that
wont
shock
the
uninitiated
i
bought
another
bottle
to
take
home
as
well
as
a
bottle
of
mort
subite
oude
gueuze
which
doesnt
have
the
late
sugar
addition
ill
see
if
i
can
taste
the
difference
375
ml
bottle
corked
champagne

aroma
of
barnyard
ensilage
and
red

vinegar
sour
sweet
flavour
with
notes
of
claret
and
red
wine
vinegar
the
recipe
includes
maize
corn
and
ascorbic
acid
a
drinkable
gueuze
but
im
not
impressed
really
quite
a
smooth
drinker
tart
flavor
dominates
at
first
but
theres
surprising
amount
of
malt
sweetness
to
the
back
end
of
the
sip
enough
to
leave
the
throat
a
bit
sticky
afterwards
finish
is
a
bit
woodymusty
ends
with
a
bit
of
a
whimper
a
belgian
beer
almost
a
speciality
beer
for
me
i
try
this
week
this
beer
and
im
not
impressed
the
belgians
are
not
my
favorites
excpet
p
kwak
this
are
very
fruity
i
try
this
only
like
appetizer
but
is
good
for
cheeses
and
french
bread
i
prefer
serve
in
a
goblet
for
appreciate
its
tones
i
recommend
72
in
my
preferences
musty
applefruity
and
slight
vinegar
aroma

as
if
it
was
just
drawn
from
a
wooden
vat
in
a
barn
slight
sour
apple
mash
taste

no
real
malts
or
hops
kick
very
dry
almost
champaignlike
in
the
mouth
still
a
pleasant
drinking
brew
would
not
mind
having
a
bottle
or
two

even
the
wifey
said
she
liked
the
taste
overall
a
pretty
good
and
very
drinkable
gueuze
although
maybe
a
touch
too
sweet
certainly
worth
a
try
a
drinkable
gueuze
but
not
really
very
true
to
the
style
it
even
lists
asorbic
acid
and
antioxidant
with
the
quotations
as
ingredients
thats
weird
this
beer
is
a
like
a
cooler
version
of
a
gueuze
i
can
understand
making
sweetened
versions
of
kriek
but
also
gueuze
why
drinkability
well
in
my
hoy
summer
sorroundings
this
is
a
great
beverage
might
have
several
in
a
row
especially
in
a
night
like
this
one
comfortable
beer
to

good
summer
beer
worth
a
try
a
smooth

sour

not
overpowering

not
overpower
the

satisfying

even
for
my
mate

being
the

it

the

the

the

i
would
have
liked
to
have
seen
a

more

to
this
one
it
was
a
good
sipper
but
somewhat
boring
the
mort
subite
geuze
in
belgium
is
7
abv
but
im
not
sure
if
there
is
a
difference
between
what
you
get
in
the
us
and
what
we
have
here
could
just
be
a
mistake
on
this
listing
this
gueuze
poured
a
clear
light
amber
color
with
creamy
white
foam
that
persisted
and
clung
to
the
inside
of
the
glass
the
smell
was
a
tart
sour
citrus
aroma
with
just
a
hint
of
sweetness
the
citrus
tickled
the
nose
the
taste
was
tart
with
some
sugary
taste
there
was
a
sour
grape
vinous
taste
as
well
as
a
hint
of
caramel
unexpected
in
a
gueuze
the
usual
musty
flavors
were
present
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
but
tart
with
medium
body
and
medium
low
carbonation
this
was
an
ok
gueuze
but
a
bit
sweeter
than
expected
i
can
never
see
myself
getting
terribly
excited
about
the
gueuze
style
of
lambic
but
i
dont
dislike
it
either
its
great
that
it
exists
i
guess
im
saying
but
i
cant
imagine
seeing
myself
returning
to
it
for
taste
or
refreshment
too
often
the
gueuze
is
brewed
by
de
keersmaeker
for
the
café
using
the
mort
subite
name
and
is
widely
available
in
the
area
it
is
unfiltered
and
quite
good
the
typical
sourness
is
balanced
by
a
light
sweetness
and
is
not
as
uncompromising
as
some
of
the
lambic
from
the
smaller
brewers
for
an
unsweetened
gueuze
mort
subite
is
definitely
quite
approachable

this

poured
a

with

the
body
was
gold
and
there
was
no

on
the

of
my
glass
there
was
a
lot
of
carbonation
with
this
lambic
the
aroma
was
fruity
sweet
and
citrusy
the
taste
was
syrupy
and
slightly
sour
the
flavor
reminded
me
of
apple
juice
this
brew
poured
a
large
head
of
fine
to
large
sized
white
bubbles
that
left
no
lacing
its
body
is
that
of
a
carbonated

it
has
a
very
strong
fruity
lambic
aroma
the
flavor
is
a
dry

and
acidic
with

fizzy
mouthfeel
an
unimpressive
average
lambic
at
best
comes
in
a
green
bottle
with
a
wire
cage
and
cork
its
cloudy
and
somewhere
between
gold
and
peach
with
an
effervescent

the
smell
is
primarily
citrus
the
flavor
also
has
pronounced
citrus
with
the
requisite
bitterness
and
some
sweetness
being
no
gueuze
expert
this
one
was
good
enough
to
keep
me
interested
in
in
tracking
down
more
a
hearty
thanks
to
longbeachbum
for
the
sample
i
liked
this
sweet

drinkable
and
very
smooth
the

the

is

i
was
hoping
for
something
more
but
im
not
dissapointed
cloudy
with
a
frothy

on
the

an
odd

after
the

not

not
quite
thick
pleasurable
gueuze
slightly
sour
slightly
sweet
not
over
the
top
but
i
dont
think
its
meant
to
be
is
it
quite
easy
to
drink
seemed
processed
compared
to
a
unadultered
lambic
odd
sweetness
behind
the
tartness
still
had
no
problem
drinking
a
few
glasses
of
it
at
la
mort
subite
cafe
in
brussels
though
also
its
a
great
deal
around
here
underrated
in
my
opinion
i
wont
say
that
about
their
other
offerings
overall
meh
it
has
some
decent
gueuze
characteristics
but
that
added
syrup
sweetness
and
lack
of
real
nice
funk
and
very
nice
lambic
characters
makes
this
a
few
steps
down
from
any
of
the
good
belgian
gueuzes
as
expected
from
what
i
had
while
at
the
brew
pub
pours
darker
than
i
expected
nice
foamy
white
head
decent
lacing
smells
and
tastes
much
sweeter
than
i
am
used
to
for
the
style
moderate
amount
of
funk
and
a
rather
large
amount
of
sourness
it
is
kinda
flat
and
pretty
sour
making
it
hard
to
consume
more
than
a
little
bit
at
a
time
the
combo
of
sweet
and
sour
just
didnt
work
here
for
me
i
enjoyed
it
for
what
it
is
but
i
wouldnt
expect
anything
earth
shattering
here
overall
a
decent
gueuze
with
some
nice
light
flavour
not
on
par
with
some
of
the
better
offerings
out
there
but
i
would
happily
drink
this
often
if
it
was
inexpensive
i
would
prefer
a
little
more
carbonation
as
well

are
pretty
light

is
about

with

not
bad
though
lacking
some

a
definitive
notch
under
their
oude
kriek
o
a
respectable
offering
that
is
clearly
the
star
of
the
mort
subite
lineup
drinkability
and
overall
impression
i
must
confess
while
i
finished
off
this
beer
it
was
more
out
of
a
motivation
to
give
it
a
fighting
chance
as
it
warmed
up
than
out
of
enjoyment
of
the
beer
the
honey
and
vanilla
are
more
than
a
bit
overdone
here
and
it
would
be
nice
to
have
some
more
prominent
lemon
zest
etc
the
sourness
is
also
a
bit
overdone
when
the
whole
profile
of
the
beer
is
considered
my
overall
impression
of
this
beer
is
that
while
it
was
more
or
less
ok
it
falls
short
of
the
mark
in
a
few
ways
notes
based
on
the
color
i
expected
this
to
have
more
caramel
malt
sweetness
but
its
clean
and
citrusy
definitely
a
surprise
based
on
the
ratings
currently
on
here
if
you
see
this
check
it
out
this
beer
poured
a
clear
amber
color
with
creamy
tall
white
foam
that
persisted
and
settled
slowly
and
clung
to
the
glass
good
bubbles
the
aroma
was
tart
and
acidic
with
some
malt
beneath
tickles
the
nose
the
flavor
was
mildly
tart
and
sour
with
usual
geuze
flavor
with
a
touch
of
fruit
lime
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
dry
with
medium
body
and
moderate
carbonation
feel
the
tart
flavors
lingered
lightly
on
the
palate
this
was
a
good
geuze
well
wortwhile
but
by
no
means
the
best
example
out
there
the
palate
opens
a
lot
sourer
than
i
was
expecting
big
lactic
sourness
right
up
front
this
is
surprising
i
cant
think
of
too
many
gueuzes
ive
had
that
have
leant
this
heavily
on
a
lactic
sourness
the
sweetness
that
is
mildly
honey
like
does
bring
to
mind
granny
smith
apples
and
white
grapes
making
this
in
some
ways
resemble
a
berlinerweiss
particularly
the
new
glarus
and
southampton
versions
citrus
sourness
is
low
though
theres
a
bit
of
lemon
peel
present
funk
is
low
theres
not
really
much
discernible
here
finishing
dry
with
a
little
tannin
character
theres
a
noticeable
sourness
lingering
on
the
alcohol
is
pretty
well
hidden
as
with
the
nose
theres
a
sharp
acetonelike
character
that
grows
as
the
beer
warms
in
some
ways
reminding
me
of
some
of
lost
abbeys
more
recent
and
weaker
offerings
mediumlight
in
body
with
high
carbonation
this
beer
is
drying
on
the
finish
while
simple
this
is
quite
enjoyable
though
that
acetone
character
does
detract
from
the
drinability
a
12
7oz
bottle
of
that
just
might
be
a
bit
much
bright
and
clear
golden
color
smell
has
a
strong
belgian
yeast
characteristic
which
threw
me
off
guard
with
the
heavy
lactic
acid
flavor
high
carbonation
with
an
average
head
an
enjoyable
gueuze
but
the
lactic
acid
over
powers
the
flavor
so
its
not
really
complex
drinkability
is
high
if
you
can
handle
the
heavy
acidity
i
love
it
and
thought
it
was
a
great
gueuze
one
of
my
favorites
of
my
belgian
trip
this
is
pretty
decent
there
is
something
about
the
complexity
or
lack
thereof
that
is
a
bit
wanting
but
i
like
that
this
is
pretty
decently
sour
taste
is
acidic
and
at
first
the
beer
makes
a
slight
sweet
impression
no
this
is
really
acidic
cant
get
it
down
a
bit
of
farmhouse
and
flowers
a
sharp
sour
that
has
something
medicinal
sorry
this
is
going
down
the
drain
after
2
sips
overall
an
excellent
gueuze
one
of
my
favourites
very
refreshing
and
definitely
worth
a
try
if
you
can
get
it
awesome
ill
drink
it
again
if
i
ever
see
it
eric
pour
is
slightly
hazed
golden
yellow
with
a
tight
white
head
nose
has
a
light
saltiness
moderate
mineral
presence
faint
lime
juice
and
lemon
flavor
is
very
minerally
up
front
bordering
on
sulfur
juicy
lemon
and
citric
acid
fairly
acidic
finish
moderate
to
soft
carb
light
delicate
body
overall
ive
enjoyed
this
geuze
and
will
be
happy
to
have
it
again
sometime
while
it
is
a
touch
mildersweeter
than
some
of
the
others
ive
had
that
also
has
a
nice
balancing
effect
on
the
tart
sourness
and
the
funk
so
this
would
be
a
good
one
to
share
with
those
new
to
the
style
that
said
i
think
it
might
have
scored
a
bit
higher
were
it
not
for
the
fact
that
my
expectations
have
been
shaped
by
having
had
several
other
gueuzes
before
this
one
e
g
the
tilquin
cantillon
hanssens
decam
etc
this
beer
is
very
enjoyable
as
it
is
outstanding
well
balanced
it
opens
up
a
different
angle
on
gueuzes
as
being
gentle
on
the
palate
without
the
usual
aggressive
tartness
still
it
contains
an
enjoyable
complexity
taste
lemon
funk
leather
amazing
overall
interesting
beer
and
glad
i
had
a
chance
to
try
it
2010
vintage
all
the
right
aromas
and
flavors
but
very
underwhelming
should
be
about
thee
times
more
intense
overall
this
gueuze
has
alot
of
the
traditional
flavors
and
smell
going
on
but
it
is
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
per
this
beer
style
of
gueuze
it
is
interesting
how
the
bready
sweet
malts
make
that
lemon
lime
flavor
add
a
slight
orange
flavor
to
the
beer
i
want
more
sourness
and
funk
with
less
sweetness
from
my
gueuze
it
was
a
good
beer
to
try
once
and
it
makes
you
appreciate
how
well
that
drie
fontienen
cantillion
and
brouwerij
girardin
brew
andor
blend
thier
respective
gueuze
very
good
geuze
it
has
a
nice
balance
between
sweet
and
sour
and
great
complexity
quite
pleasant
to
drink
should
please
a
wide
range
of
beer
drinkers
this
is
an
oude
geuze
that
will
appeal
to
a
lot
of
drinkers
it
has
everything
of
a
oude
geuze
from
the
senne
valley
but
it
is
also
quite
mild
and
not
too
sour
i
liked
it
very
much
overall
an
enjoyable
and
refreshing
geuze
lacking
some
depth
but
certainly
a
step
above
a
cuvee
renee
its
surprisingly
funky
i
think
this
would
benefit
from
a
little
more
time
in
the
bottle
would
certainly
tick
again
food
match
gueuzes
are
palate
quenching
kings
so
they
will
really
work
with
anything
but
sharp
cheese
platters
are
par
excellence
cuisine
pour
cela
im
glad
i
found
this
at
best
damn
beer
store
in
san
diego
the
history
of
the
brewery
is
an
interesting
read
as
well
from
the
750
ml
belgian
bottle
and
for
once
i
am
glad
to
see
a
traditional
cork
though
it
was
rather
explosive
on
applying
the
pliers
cost
was
16
o
this
is
a
really
good
gueuze
it
has
a
really
nice
pucker
good
complexity
and
great
flavors
hazy
cloudy
golden
color
with
white
fluffy
head
dissipating
to
a
ring
aroma
of
lemon
zest
and
funk
highly
effervescent
carb
lightly
drying
and
a
mildly
bitter
finish
really
nice
for
its
price
if
you
like
high
carbonation
on
a
gueuze
overall
a
solid
affordable
gueuze
but
not
one
i
would
routinely
go
to
to
get
a
fix
the
mid
body
turn
of
the
oak
is
really
a
disappointment
overall
though
worth
a
shot
overall
this
is
my
introduction
to
the
geuze
style
i
am
surprised
this
was
one
funky
brew
pretty
complex
yet
this
is
my
first
step
to
the
style
this
brew
is
worthy
its
a
good
beer
i
enjoyed
it
quite
a
bit
i
think
this
hangs
with
many
of
the
marquee
beers
out
4
12
od
a
nice
gueuze
to
sip
lacks
the
epic
complexity
and
touch
of
sweetness
of
others
but
it
was
still
a
good
one
definitely
not
as
tart
as
other
examples
final
thoughts
first
experience
with
the
style
but
a
good
one
memorable
for
the
dry
tart
flavor
would
i
drink
it
again
sure
only
my
second
ever
gueuze
style
one
but
it
was
quite
a
nice
beer
definitely
one
that
started
to
grow
on
me
as
i
worked
my
way
down
the
glass
perhaps
too
sour
for
my
tastes
initially
but
from
the
half
way
point
on
wards
it
started
to
go
down
very
easily
o
excellent
bought
in
birmingham
al
drank
aug
3rd
in
hopkinsville
ky
overall
a
great
interpretation
of
an
authentic
geuze
lots
of
weird
funky
and
sour
flavors
that
set
it
apart
from
the
american
sour
ales
recommended
and
easy
to
find
hazy
golden
blonde
colour
ring
of
white
head
some
lace
as
well
smell
is
funky
a
bit
lactic
fruity
with
notes
of
green
apple
acidic
notes
similar
to
fresh
lemon
juice
a
bit
of
barnyard
smells
like
it
is
going
to
be
quite
sour
taste
is
a
mix
of
funky
and
fruity
musty
basement
lemony
citric
acid
flavours
tart
towards
the
finish
mildly
sour
in
comparison
to
what
the
nose
sugested
dry
throughout
and
into
the
finish
medium
dry
carbonation
medium
bodied
probably
one
of
the
easier
drinking
geuze
i
have
had
perhaps
owing
largely
to
the
freshness
of
the
bottle
im
sure
with
time
this
will
become
funkier
but
it
is
quite
nice
so
young
already
a
tasty
gueuze
here
not
super
common
in
the
states
at
least
in
my
experience
so
thanks
to
claystation
for
getting
it
here
live
a
hazy
blonde
beer
that
has
some
very
evident
acidity
a
short
white
head
but
some
pretty
good
lace
one
it
and
a
lot
of
fizz
here
a
whiff
of
green
bottle
staleness
to
this
but
it
seems
somehow
pleasant
with
light
lemony
and
lactic
acidity
tons
of
oak
to
the
taste
lighter
body
than
other
gueuze
and
a
very
light
lemon
character
that
makes
this
distinct
to
me
acidity
is
less
than
it
smells
like
it
might
be
but
right
about
medium
in
comparison
to
the
field
wheat
malt
base
has
a
soft
texture
and
the
big
bubbles
make
it
feel
great
on
the
palate
refreshing
and
clean
this
tastes
authentic
to
me
it
reeks
of
open
fermentation
in
oak
vessels
and
while
it
lacks
the
true
layered
beauty
of
say
a
cantillon
it
seems
to
me
to
be
done
in
a
very
traditional
way
and
with
great
success
others
have
liked
this
less
but
i
find
it
one
of
the
more
drinkable
examples
of
the
style
id
like
to
see
it
more
available
bottle
2007
vintage
7
years
old
pours
a
clear
gold
with
thick
white
foam
aroma
is
intensely
cheesy
with
some
barnyard
and
wood
taste
has
a
nice
sourness
it
is
also
quite
sweet
and
the
wheat
is
very
present
this
one
is
miles
ahead
from
the
unrefined
fresh
version
the
nose
is
stellar
but
the
taste
could
be
more
refined
although
this
lambic
drinks
easily
close
to
the
best
examples
of
this
style
3
8
o
good
drinkability
great
gueuze
lambic
fans
will
really
enjoy
it
as
i
did
o
a
nice
drinkable
gueuze
not
on
the
extreme
end
like
some
of
the
higher
rated
of
the
style
but
a
good
intro
into
the
style
before
trying
some
of
the
more
flavorful
examples
92100
overall
nice
shelf
geueze
at
10
for
a
750
off
the
shelf
its
worth
it
and
if
it
was
a
saison
it
would
be
rated
better
than
it
is
on
here
while
this
isnt
the
most
complex
gueuze
the
flavors
work
very
well
together
theres
a
bright
acidity
mellow
oak
tannins
and
an
all
around
nice
funk
ill
pick
these
up
again
in
the
future
no
doubt
overall
perhaps
a
little
tamer
than
other
geuzes
with
a
nice
underlying
sweetness
that
i
found
quite
enjoyable
clear
copper
light
head
smell
is
brilliant
sweet
fruity
hint
of
balsamic
agèd
and
nuanced
taste
is
equally
compelling
light
funky
vaguely
sweet
very
clean
finish
funky
enough
to
be
interesting
very
nice
recommended
will
have
again
prost
cheesy
and
musty
funk
with
a
light
sourness
very
mellow
wheat
and
barley
malts
seem
nectary
and
smooth
lemon
and
tart
apricot
and
wet
hay
subtle
gueuze
flavors
without
much
acidic
distraction
heavier
feel
for
a
gueuze
with
extremely
low
carbonation
and
a
mediumfull
body
almost
absent
of
stick
the
finish
is
long
and
tempered
great
beer
i
found
this
to
be
a
good
geuze
through
and
through
the
interpretations
of
this
style
that
i
enjoy
most
are
those
that
have
that
big
kick
of
dryness
or
that
mouth
puckering
tartness
or
strange
funkiness
you
cant
put
your
finger
on
or
all
of
the
above
in
comparison
to
what
i
really
like
i
found
this
to
be
tamed
and
clean
theres
nothing
wrong
with
that
it
just
depends
what
youre
looking
for
onot
something
i
would
drink
regularly
but
it
certainly
has
its
time
and
place
when
paired
with
some
greysnowy
weather
and
a
tim
hecker
album
you
cant
go
wrong
overall
a
good
beer
but
not
one
of
the
stronger
gueuzes
o
a
very
nice
geuze
the
nose
is
intense
and
pleasant
which
the
taste
cant
quite
match
though
o
an
very
good
tart
beer
with
a
funk
derived
fruitiness
the
sour
character
is
the
most
prominent
flavor
but
it
is
does
overpower
the
rest
of
the
beer
a
great
beer
to
pair
with
meals
just
avoid
sweet
sauces
unless
you
enjoy
that
toothpaste
orange
thing
in
the
morning
poured
a
cloudy
yellow
with
a
three
finger
white
head
that
stuck
around
for
a
bit
quite
nice
to
look
at
scent
is
sour
with
heavy
lemon
juice
and
barnyard
funk
with
a
very
slight
bit
of
bubblegum
good
what
a
geuze
usually
has
but
with
a
slight
hint
of
some
saison
traits
taste
follows
sour
lactic
and
lemon
mostly
with
some
slight
grassy
flavors
and
some
sour
green
apple
in
the
background
good
and
sour
like
a
geuze
should
be
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
high
carbonation
very
crisp
and
refreshing
overall
this
is
the
best
of
the
three
geuzes
ive
tried
its
more
sour
and
dryer
than
lindemans
cuvee
rene
and
it
has
more
character
than
st
louis
geuze
fond
tradition
d
i
cant
say
im
impressed
with
this
one
too
much
carbonation
too
little
aroma
and
flavor
o
enjoyable
from
start
to
finish
this
was
my
favorite
of
the
three
overall
this
is
a
good
gueuze
but
there
several
better
similarly
or
cheaper
priced
and
just
as
available
options
out
there
worth
a
try
but
not
a
repeat
purchase
overall
an
enjoyable
geuze
but
not
as
complex
as
some
others
not
overly
impressive
but
definitely
true
to
style
and
refreshing
to
drink
its
lacking
some
flavors
that
other
geuzes
ive
tried
have
had
which
hurts
drinkability
id
have
another
but
wont
be
buying
it
again
on
my
own
there
are
better
options
amazing
flavors
of
sour
malt
and
slight
ever
so
slight
hop
nicely
sour
fruitiness
mixes
with
the
corny
malt
sours
are
so
hard
to
rate
but
this
is
amazing
due
to
its
unique
qualities
pair
this
food
with
bbq
pork
with
a
tritip
salad
buttery
rolls
and
collard
greens
are
a
must
on
the
side

nice

with

a
very

offering
overall
i
might
be
a
little
biased
as
a
lover
of
the
style
but
this
was
one
great
beer
that
i
would
enjoy
as
often
as
a
could
afford
glad
i
finally
got
to
try
this
and
good
to
know
i
dont
have
to
break
my
back
to
find
an
excellent
example
of
this
style
in
the
area
without
having
to
pay
tons
of
money
as
well
this
is
definitely
not
a
gueuze
for
beginners
for
all
of
the
musty
dried
fruity
textures
going
on
but
its
relatively
wellgrounded
in
terms
of
seeking
complexity
and
balance
never
a
chore
to
drink
and
i
could
have
this
all
night
fantastic
stuff
no
this
one
didt
age
as
well
as
the
other
lambics
i
have
had
it
is
not
very
complex
and
the
aftertaste
is
too
short
overall
a
great
introduction
to
the
style
i
cant
believe
ive
never
tried
a
gueuze
before
looking
forward
to
the
other
ones
in
the
cellar
overall
a
really
nice
tasty
gueuze
definitely
some
nice
complexity
from
the
yeast
not
as
bright
and
sour
as
other
examples
of
the
style
i
have
had
but
it
is
surprising
complex
definitely
worth
the
purchase
there
is
good
reasons
for
not
making
beer
this
way
anymore
from
first
trip
to
belgium
in
2010
found
tasting
notes
on
this
beer
which
was
our
virgin
voyage
with
these
crazy
gueuze
brews
this
one
in
particular
did
not
stand
out
in
our
glass
golden
yellow
with
a
taste
that
was
most
remniscent
of
dry
tart
fruity
white
wine
the
endnote
of
this
brew
wasnt
particularly
liked
as
it
was
watery
and
flat
otherwise
the
funkiness
and
sourness
was
on
point
this
is
a
delightful
oude
geuze
that
would
be
great
for
casual
sipping
on
a
warm
day
or
with
food
overall
for
the
price
i
payed
for
this
bottle
it
was
good
but
id
rather
buy
the
kriek
again
bottle
purchased
from
colonial
wine
with
best
served
by
date
of
june
2032
poured
on
32013
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
it
pours
the
color
of
pale
canteloupe
flesh
with
a
shade
of
soil
to
it
it
lets
very
little
light
pass
through
at
all
and
has
a
very
uniform
haze
theres
a
good
amount
of
fizzy
head
that
leaves
no
lacing
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
good
it
has
that
expected
farmland
funk
to
it
but
no
so
overbearing
as
to
destroy
all
the
other
scents
theres
definite
sour
cherry
and
some
champagne
flavor
on
the
nose
the
taste
is
pretty
sour
which
is
very
good
even
to
a
hop
head
like
me
its
tasty
and
puckering
and
very
active
on
the
tongue
very
fizzy
the
taste
is
sweet
too
like
a
fresh
peach
with
a
sour
cherry
pucker
to
it
too
very
good
beer
overall
drinks
easy
a
decent
gueze
there
are
better
overall
a
light
refreshing
and
overall
delightful
farmhouse
ale
nice
geueze
that
is
easy
to
find
while
in
belgium
o
not
as
insanely
in
your
face
as
drie
fonteinen
oude
geuze
but
it
still
has
that
strange
astringency
i
dont
like
maybe
geuzes
just
arent
my
thing
overall
this
one
was
tollerable
but
a
little
too
barnyard
foward
for
my
tastes
though
i
prefer
more
sourness
and
acidity
this
is
still
a
decent
gueuze
that
i
could
imagine
sharing
with
friends
a
full
bottle
would
be
too
much
for
me
finished
at
the
lower
end
of
the
spectrum
in
this
lineup
a
solid
gueuze
on
all
fronts
a
good
balance
of
funk
and
tartness
refreshing
and
delicious
d
very
drinkable
nice
complex
lambic
with
good
sourness
and
tartness
overall
a
light
but
very
flavorful
beer
really
drinkable
has
a
fruitiness
but
a
freshness
too
outstanding
beer
a
bit
pricy
but
i
would
have
it
again
been
doing
a
few
from
this
style
lately
this
is
easier
drinking
than
other
brewers
of
this
style
a
touch
softer
the
sour
isnt
such
a
kick
in
the
face
as
others
nice
bittersour
balance
liked
this
quite
a
bit
the
lack
of
monstrous
tart
love
actually
makes
this
more
drinkable
than
your
typical
gueuze
it
actually
drinks
sort
of
like
a
berliner
best

d
definite
must
try
for
sour
beer
lovers
i
think
this
would
also
make
a
good
gateway
beer
for
those
wanting
to
give
the
whole
sour
beer
thing
a
try
nice
tart
front
and
smooth
oak
flavor
at
the
end
good
balance
and
nice
complexity
o
this
beer
is
definitely
more
bretty
than
sour
a
decent
gueuze
but
there
are
plenty
of
other
ones
out
there
i
prefer
not
to
start
a
tirade
but
i
think
this
beer
was
a
victim
of
sitting
on
a
shelf
in
its
green
bottle
i
dont
see
the
point
of
using
green
bottles
for
beer
even
ones
with
low
hop
content
i
think
id
have
been
disappointed
if
i
had
cellared
this
for
years
myself
only
to
find
it
had
been
skunked
from
the
day
i
bought
it
o
just
what
the
doctor
ordered
although
the
look
and
smell
arent
a
show
stopper
the
tart
and
funky
but
superior
balancing
act
between
smells
and
tastes
that
would
otherwise
be
off
putting
clean
the
palate
and
warm
the
belly
drink
i
paired
this
with
a
ribeye
and
it
was
very
nice
the
meat
really
cut
through
and
the
gueuze
brought
out
the
spice
rub
fantastically
375ml
caged
corked
punted
and
best
for
the
next
19
years
overall
very
nice
maybe
just
a
step
down
from
drie
fonteinen
overall
wonderful
i
will
try
to
buy
this
again
if
it
was
easily
available
and
reasonably
priced
i
would
probably
make
it
a
summer
staple
o
very
easy
to
drink
very
refreshing
and
very
enjoyable
this
is
definitely
one
to
get
again
it
is
not
overly
sour
or
funky
so
would
likely
appeal
to
people
just
starting
out
in
this
style
pours
perfectly
transparent
and
bright
gold
big
puffy

that
sticks
around
for
quite
awhile
oak
big
sweet
and
sour
lemons
light
grain
a
mineral
note
white
wine
vinegar
and
a
difficult
to
place
earthiness
make
up
the
aroma
its
difficult
to
describe
theres
lots
of
complexity
and
sour
depth
its
a
very
nice
gueuze
aroma
on
the
lower
end
of
the
funk
spectrum
not
that
theres
anything
wrong
with
funk
taste
is
a
bit
less
complex
but
still
quite
good
its
dry
and
sour
with
a
tannin
finish
oak
and
mild
funk
throughout
mouthfeel
is
softly
effervescent
and
mildly
bracing
from
the
tannin
and
sour
great
beer
oud
beersel
makes
excellent
lambics
this
gueuze
is
easy
to
like
and
fun
to
drink
overall
a
very
nice
gueuze
with
some
great
fruity
funky
smells
going
on
would
like
to
try
one
aged
another
5
or
10
years
taste
is
rounded
and
has
lactic
acid
in
it
there
is
a
distinct
lemon
taste
more
zesty
than
of
the
lemon
flesh
the
acidity
is
not
aggresive
or
tangy
it
is
pleasant
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
but
certainly
for
the
style
spot
on
usually
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
sours
but
this
beer
is
so
balanced
and
pleasantly
sour
an
absolute
winner
pours
light
golden
ale
with
a
solid
quilt
of
light
white
foam
nose
comes
out
with
plenty
of
funk
hay
manure
horse
hair
lemons
carbon
dioxide
more
a
sensation
than
flavor
hints
of
pepper
and
lactic
acid
nice
and
tart
with
a
degree
of
brett
that
is
a
little
over
powering
for
me
with
a
chalky
and
bicarbonate
addition
there
is
a
bit
of
hay
and
soil
with
a
lemon
zest
and
acetic
and
lactic
acids
im
surprised
how
subdued
the
sour
is
in
this
one
thin
bodied
with
hi
carb
and
dry
finish
standard
this
is
not
a
great
gueuze
for
me
not
tart
enough
and
a
little
too
much
brett
i
will
likely
buy
a
few
more
bottles
at
some
point
for
aging
but
only
to
see
where
it
goes
i
dont
get
the
feeling
this
beer
is
going
to
be
more
sour
drink
and
overall
yeah
its
good
its
not
great
but
man
it
really
hit
the
spot
and
gave
me
what
i
was
looking
for
i
think
its
an
above
average
gueuze
beer
is
mediumlight
in
body
with
a
fairly
high
level
of
carbonation
causing
this
to
foam
up
perhaps
a
bit
too
much
on
the
palate
resultant
mouthfeel
is
more
bubbly
and
creamy
than
smooth
but
still
quite
palatable
with
no
wateriness
around
the
edges
closes
out
crisp
and
dry
with
slight
stickiness
around
the
lips
overall
a
wellcrafted
if
straightforward
gueuze
i
just
happen
to
really
enjoy

beer

originally
reviewed

i

as

subsided

it

overall
this
was
a
pretty
good
brew
i
bought
this
one
on
simple
fact
that
it
was
one
of
the
top
rated
of
the
style
on
ba
i
figured
if
i
want
to
call
myself
a
true
fan
of
the
style
i
need
to
try
as
many
of
these
as
i
can
to
be
able
to
gauge
my
review
this
one
definitely
did
not
disappoint
all
of
the
right
flavors
and
aromas
were
there
with
a
nice
touch
of
different
lemon
components
to
add
another
layer
of
complexity
to
an
already
solid
style
really
well
done
and
i
would
highly
recommend
it
to
anyone
who
calls
themselves
a
fan
of
gueuzesgeuzes
o
its
a
good
beer
but
is
it
a
good
lambic
as
far
as
true
lambics
go
id
say
its
pretty
mediocre
it
did
not
fare
well
with
a
few
of
us
who
did
a
blind
tasting
of
gueuze
last
year
in
fact
we
all
agreed
that
the
considerablycheaper
and
often
notaswell
regarded
cuvee
renee
was
better
and
were
not
exactly
inexperienced
lambic
drinkers
we
all
correctly
recognized
each
of
the
5
or
so
gueuzes
at
the
blind
tasting
by
the
smell
anyway
its
also
a
big
step
down
in
complexity
and
general
enjoyability
from
cantillon
3f
or
tilquin
so
if
you
have
a
choice
those
three
are
definitely
worth
the
extra
cash
o
a
nice
gateway
gueuze
if
ever
one
existed
one
that
would
go
well
with
dinner
the
beer
was
very
complex
and
enjoyable
but
the
metallic
finish
was
too
strong
and
unpleasant
i
do
look
forward
to
trying
this
again
to
see
if
there
was
something
with
the
bottle
or
just
something
that
i
ate
that
messed
up
this
tasting
anyways
pick
up
a
bottle
and
give
it
a
shot
the
orangetinged
dark
yellow
beer
poured
with
a
pop
and
a
fizz
but
the
head
quickly
receded
the
aroma
burst
out
with
cork
as
well
but
it
quickly
faded
into
a
yeast
and
musty
affair
laced
with
pear
and
classic
funk
sour
and
tart
on
the
palate
but
not
to
the
extent
of
some
of
the
more
complex
gueuzes
there
is
a
bit
of
apple
seed
bitterness
that
lingers
on
the
palate
bottle
to
red
wine
glass
looks
good
light
orange
and
pretty
transparent
with
lacing
around
the
edges
smells
great
tart
and
fruity
tastes
good
but
not
as
great
as
it
smells
a
little
too
subtle
for
the
price
mouthfeel
is
good
feels
like
a
good
geuze
overall
a
tasty
brew
that
i
wish
was
a
little
livelier
lively
carbonation
contributes
to
a
crisp
clean
quenching
mouthfeel
finishes
dry
pairs
beautifully
with
food
cutting
nicely
through
fatty
cheeses
and
heavily
sauced
pastas
refreshing
and
clean
this
gueuze
is
best
with
spicy
pasta
the
acidity
makes
it
difficult
to
consume
more
than
one
glass
at
a
time
i
couldnt
ask
for
a
better
looking
geuze
the
color
is
a
slightly
pale
golden
straw
with
an
absolutely
perfect
head
it
wisps
around
the
snifter
with
each
sip
not
much
visible
carbonation
but
the
head
indicates
that
its
doing
just
fine
smells
like
a
barnyard
some
cherry
and
apple
notes
pop
out
but
definitely
getting
a
horse
blanket
vibe
here
taste
is
about
as
sour
as
i
anticipated
and
balanced
by
a
dry
finish
the
best
part
about
this
beer
is
its
drinkability
the
carbonation
plays
very
well
with
the
funky
nature
of
this
beer
i
have
had
this
one
before
and
will
have
it
again
better
than
i
remember
it
being
cheers
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
refreshing
carbonation
is
very
lively
on
the
palate
this
is
a
very
drinkable
geuze
nice
flavor
and
refreshing
the
sourness
doesnt
kill
your
palate
o
kind
of
unfair
considering
cantillon
is
my
benchmark
but
this
is
still
a
good
gueuze
o
i
love
sour
beers
so
i
am
bias
this
beer
is
very
wine
like
because
of
the
zingy
sour
fruit
it
does
have
a
lot
of
earth
and
mineral
as
well
somewhat
dusty
it
is
an
experience
to
drink
and
enjoy
o
the
aroma
was
quite
nice
but
the
flavor
lacked
depth
not
bad
but
im
not
particularly
impressed
cheers
overall
i
am
very
impressed
what
a
complex
beer
there
is
so
much
going
on
here
and
it
is
nothing
like
i
have
ever
had
before
i
would
like
to
try
some
different
beers
in
this
style
this
is
one
heck
of
a
brew
im
glad
i
sought
it
out
o
lovely
decent
one
pours
a
murky
honey
color
with
a
1
inch
fizzy
bone
colored
head
that
settles
to
a
thin
cap
random
streaks
of
foam
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
sour
and
funky
with
some
slight
fruit
and
earthy
and
woody
aromas
taste
is
pretty
much
the
same
but
not
all
that
sour
or
funky
flavor
wise
this
beer
has
a
high
level
of
carbonation
with
a
super
crisp
and
bubbly
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
gueuze
but
its
definitely
not
as
sour
and
funky
as
i
like
them
to
be
with
the
best
before
date
being
18
years
in
the
future
it
would
be
interesting
to
lay
one
of
these
down
to
see
if
these
flavors
evolve
golden
orange
hue
small
white
head
good
lactic
sour
nose
wet
barrel
wood
and
modest
mold
funk
the
flavors
are
lemony
with

could

get
half

poured
a
dark

dissipates

just
a

of

of

some

was
a
bit
surprised
by
this
beer
fairly
dry
with
a
fruity
grapefruit
style
but
still
very
quiet
the
palate
follows
from
this
perspective
tannic
acid
quickly
dissipating
head
it
smells
of
sour
peachy
apricots
yet
isnt
as
fruity
as
the
hanssens
gueuze
theres
a
lot
of
funk
the
flavor
is
again
very
tannic
and
features
a
lot
of
dehydrated
fruits
the
funk
is
nice
and
i
swear
the
brett
is
powerful
in
this
its
overly
carbonated
so
drinks
light
and
fizzy
you
would
have
thought
that
this
wine
glass
is
laser
etched
the
flavor
is
a
little
short
lived
its
sour
but
it
doesnt
resonate
and
is
somewhat
quick
to
fade
the
beer
is
pretty
light
and
drinks
quickly
overall
its
a
solid
gueuze
but
not
exceptional
by
any
means

impression
a

of
discussion

went
on
about
this
one
regarding
what
kind
of
citrus
fruit
we
could
smell
and
taste
finally
with
some
musty
mushroom
character
the
first
impression
of
this
geuze
is

of
sourness

this
one

especially
because
it
embodies
the
definition
of
refreshing
neither
strong
nor
quiet
just
well
with
a
lemony
colour
is
copperlike
combined
with
a
white
foamy
head
taste
and
smell
reminds
me
of
an
old
geuze
which
has
been
sweetened
but
not
as
much
as
a
faro
though
theres
also
not
much
in
the
aftertaste
good
alternative
for
a
regular
pilsner
but
nothing
more
very
effervescent
medium
tartness
medium
body
the
taste
has
a
mild
tinge
of
sour
and
light
spicy
flavor
with
yeast
character
that
gives
way
to
a
creamy
taste
which
is
slightly
sweet
giving
a
mild
lemon
note
with
gentle
caramel
and
dry
toasted
finish
overall
one
of
the
least
enjoyable
examples
of
the
style
not
to
say
it
is
not
enjoyable
i
had
a
hard
time
with
the
review
since
it
is
not
what
i
consider
a
gueuze
since
it
lacks
a
sourness
i
expect
but
it
is
not
bad
if
you
prefer
more
malt
b
poured
into
a
cantillon
glass
smells
a
bit
basic
with
some
low
profile
brett
and
mustiness
the
taste
is
obviously
sweetened
which
means
this
is
probably
pasteurized
of
the
dumbed
down
gueuze
i
have
tried
this
isnt
the
worst
by
a
long
shot
however
it
is
a
far
cry
from
the
real
stuff
i
can
appreciate
what
this
is
though
and
if
i
think
of
it
as
a
new
style
as
opposed
to
the
real
thing
it
is
is
actually
pretty
good
and
very
drinkable
interestingly
my
wife
loves
it
and
she
doesnt
like
much
else
in
the
beer
world
very
cheap
in
belgium
and
worth
a
try
at
least
it
isnt
trying
to
look
traditional
wi
th
a
cork
and
all
that
oh
yikes
smells
ok
some
sweetness
and
tennis
shoe
aroma
but
the
taste
is
way
too
sweet
with
little
body
or
anything
else
tasty
not
sure
what
something
was
thinking
but
this
is
not
a
good
beer
lacking
in
anything
resembling
a
decent
normal
beer
or
sour
beer
dont
know
that
the
objective
was
but
amongst
10
tasters
no
one
liked
this
beast
overall
sweet
geuze
not

no

please
cheers
o

one
a
shot
not

se
just
not

the

was

with

and
citrus
but
a
bit
too
much
thickness
and
rotten
fruit
the
drink
was
quick
and
for
a
second
i
thought
of
ordering
another
just
because
it
went
down
so
good
overall
a
decent
gueuze
but
not
a
competitor
for
my
wallet
in
belgium
with
so
many
other
finer

beer
bottle
from
the
supermarket
the
beer
has
a
nice
pour
an
amber
body
with
a
tall
head
the
aroma
is
bittersweet
some
lemongrapefruit
smells
along
with
a
light
juicy
fruitiness
no
sourness
at
all
taste
citric
components
a
sharp
sweet
malt
some
very
hidden
sourness
light
fruits
and
a
bit
of
sugary
sweetness
the
finish
is
lightly
sweet
with
some
citric
bitterness
added
this
beer
made
guezes
popular
among
the
mass
consuming
beer
drinkers
but
i
will
never
have
it
again
junk
beer
acidity
in
the
nose
but
not
transcendent
because
there
also
collects
cardboard
odors
the
taste
is
slightly
sweet
which
is
a
good
point
in
relation
to
commercial
gueuzes
often
sickening
glucose
however
it
lacks
relief
tannins
and
acidity
are
nonexistent
unfortunately
unconvincing
only
the
finish
is
slightly
tart
but
far
from
it
to
crown
a
great
lambic
drinkability
is
okay
this
one
is
just
too
sweet
for
me
and
feels
muddy
overall
seems
like
it
needs
something
more
bitterness
or
funk
or
acidity
to
balance
out
the
sweetness
overall
this
gueuze
definitely
showed
its
aged
it
wasnt
very
enjoyable
compared
to
others
that
are
a
bit
younger
very
fruity
but
also
a
good
introduction
to
the
world
of
sours
seems
to
be
pretty
popular
with
the
younger
locals
as
well
drinkability
is
good
a
quaffable
kiddie
beer
that
isnt
at
all
sour
but
not
laden
with
nutrasweet
either
mouthfeel
crisp
sharp
carbonation
and
a
light
body
i
am
a
fan
of
the
traditional
geuze
beers
of
belgium
and
i
know
this
is
not
the
best
example
had
a
bottle
at
my
hotel
in
ghent
i
found
this
to
be
a
little
similar
to
lindemans
faro
in
how
sweet
it
was
theres
a
lot
of
sugar
added
by
the
taste
but
theres
still
a
tasty
sour
nothing
puckering
but
pleasant
id
call
this
a
gueze
for
beginners
not
nearly
as
bad
as
i
expected
but
still
not
my
preference
at
all
for
a
lambic
i
could
see
recommending
this
to
someone
who
is
a
bit
wary
of
traditional
lambics
into
a
stange
it
goes
and
the
beer
has
a
foggy
brownishorange
color
topped
off
by
a
white
compact
head
the
smell
is
fruity
and
sour
with
just
a
little
skunkw
escaping
but
what
does
it
taste
like
calm
down
there
damn
thats
pretty
sour
and
acidic
i
cant
find
any
fruit
in
the
flavor
is
that
a
bad
thing
ok
there
is
but
its
weak
and
watery
tastes
more
like
vegetables
were
used
in
this
one
i
dont
know
why
why
cant
it
taste
like
the
smell
the
sourness
is
starting
to
gain
my
acceptance
but
its
too
late
theres
little
else
that
makes
me
want
to
try
this
again

this
is
a
gentle
lambicone
that
would
be
a
good
introduction
to
the
style
true
lambic
lovers
might
probably
will
suck
their
teeth
at
this
macro
offering
of
a
traditional
and
distinct
style
being
impartial
i
say
it
would
serve
very
well
to
those
being
introduced
to
the
style
if
you
can
manage
to
acknowledge
it
for
what
it
is
a
macro
attempt
at
a
truly
craft
orientated
style
than
id
think
you
shouldnt
have
too
much
trouble
enjoying
it
i
did
375
cl
bottle
poured
in
a
belle
vue
flute
glass
deep
golden
orange
colour
correct
head
that
fades
but
leaving
always
a
thin
cloak
on
the
surface
aroma
of
acid
apples
oranges
some
barnyard
not
as
sour
as
usual
taste
is
of
acid
apples
wood
apricots
some
sourness
but
not
as
much
as
other
gueuzes
probably
good
for
lambics
beginners
but
not
the
best
example
the
belle
vue
gueze
pours
into
my
champagne
flute
with
a
golden
amber
body
adorned
with
a
white
frothy
head
that
holds
a
nice
film
lacing
down
the
glass
the
beer
has
an
aroma
that
is
slightly
skunked
from
the
green
bottle
with
that
familiar
sweet
lambic
smell
and
just
notes
of
the
normal
sourness
the
beer
tastes
very
sweet
up
front
followed
by
a
mellow
sourness
from
the
spontaneous
fermentation
the
beer
leaves
a
sticky
residue
upon
the
palate
with
a
bit
of
dryness
the
medium
body
is
complemented
by
a
lively
effervescent
carbonation
overall
its
a
drinkable
gueze
as
its
not
too
sour
to
overwhelm
a
newcomer
to
the
style
but
not
very
complex
and
doesnt
keep
your
taste
buds
guessing
not
a
bad
to
try
out
the
style
but
seasoned
veterans
will
get
bored
after
a
few
sips
opinion
this
was
an
ok
beer
but
it
was
really
mild
for
the
style
i
didnt
know
what
to
expect
since
it
was
so
old
but
it
follow
just
about
every
other
belle
vue
beer
i
have
tried
it
is
mild
and
very
drinkable
which
would
appeal
to
more
masses
i
would
stick
to
the
girardin
or
cantillon
or
even
lindemans
cuvee
renee
before
i
would
pick
this
one
up
draft
at
cafe
den
engel
in
antwerpen
on
91106
pours
brownishorange
with
raisin
and
brown
sugar
on
the
nose
along
with
some
sourness
the
palate
shows
gentle
fruit
malt
and
semispicy
flavors
its
good
but
theres
just
not
too
much
going
on
here
the
mouthfeel
is
surprisingly
light
and
for
that
matter
so
is
the
drinkability
its
suspiciously
easy
maybe
even
not
challenging
enough
for
a
gueuze
now
isnt
that
a
masochistic
thing
to
say
meh
pours
a
crystal
clear
reddish
brown
color
with
almost
no
head
besides
a
collar
of
white
bubbles
smells
tart
and
fruity
slightly
earhty
slightly
of
raisins
since
this
is
my
first
gueuze
i
really
dont
have
a
frame
of
reference
for
the
style
taste
is
sweet
and
tart
lots
of
honey
and
fruit
flavors
with
a
smooth
woody
flavor
that
seems
to
finish
out
this
beers
flavor
mouthfeel
is
pretty
much
flat
but
interesting
an
ethereal
smoothness
pervades
this
beer
making
it
stand
apart
not
saying
better
or
worse
but
different
from
every
style
and
beer
that
i
have
sampled
dark
gold
body
with
a
fluffy
white
head
the
head
did
give
way
to
islands
of
foam
in
the
beer
aroma
was
souring
musty
and
damp
but
a
hint
of
something
sweet
was
mixed
in
also
cork
was
present
taste
was
a
brief
second
of
sweetness
and
then
a
tart
sour
flavor
came
in
the
flavor
is
different
yet
interesting
in
its
own
sortofway
smooth
and
bitter
in
the
mouth
but
hard
to
drink
this
is
an
interesting
style
of
beer
overall
i
couldnt
handle
too
many
of
this
style
of
beer
maybe
it
was
this
bottle
or
style
but
one
or
the
other
is
not
for
me
pale
golden
honey
color
witha
huge
white
rocky
head
tart
vinious
aroma
has
a
acidic
fruitness
to
it
citric
acid
thicker
mouthfeel
than
i
was
expecting
almost
sweet
deinetly
not
as
sour
tasting
as
the
aroma
leeds
you
to
believe
almost
no
aftertaste
at
all
drinkable
yes
but
i
think
this
is
a
far
cry
from
a
tradtional
gueuze
maybe
a
good
introduction
for
people
not
familiar
with
belgian
lamics
pours
with
little
or
no
head
and
minimal
lacing
the
sour
taste
for
which
this
style
is
noted
was
weak
stronger
malt
and
fruit
in
the
nose
and
a
clean
if
somewhat
vinous
finish
i
will
try
another
lambic
from
a
different
brewer
and
decide
whether
this
is
a
style
i
will
stick
with
bland
timid
lame
mild
and
most
definitely
not
worth
the
3
99
i
paid
for
it
this
was
an
ok
beer
and
in
comparison
to
mort
subite
i
really
prefer
the
latter
even
though
it
took
me
a
while
to
appreciate
it
but
as
i
understand
the
style
this
was
too
sweet
for
what
it
is
supposed
to
be
despite
my
initial
caution
i
like
belle
vue
gueuze
it
isnt
a
worldbeater
and
wont
cause
me
to
shout
the
praises
of
gueuze
from
the
rooftops
but
it
is
light
fruity
and
satifying
should
be
great
to
sip
on
a
hot
summer
day
when
you
dont
feel
like
doing
much
of
anything
at
all
thanks
gueuzegeek
poured
perfectly
clear
caramel
colour
initially
supported
a
thick
head
of
foam
comprised
of
large
bubbles
which
disappeared
too
quickly
once
in
the
glass
it
gave
off
aromas
of
wet
cork
ripe
apples
and
pears
nutmeg
and
believe
it
or
not
cigar
tobacco
some
complexity
but
very
low
intensity
first
sip
revealed
thin
mouthfeel
and
softness
of
orchard
fruits
followed
by
hints
of
oak
and
mild
grapefruit
peel
bitterness
which
disappeared
almost
as
rapidly
as
the
head
being
a
fan
of
all
things
gueuze
i
was
happy
to
taste
it
but
i
dont
consider
this
to
be
a
serious
contender
to
dethrone
cantillon
boon
or
lindemans
as
the
classic
gueuze
overall
this
beer
is
a
very
soft
but
ultimately
approachable
soft
example
of
the
gueze
style
and
would
probably
make
a
good
follow
up
to
a
kriek
or
framboise
in
introducing
someone
to
lambics
the
color
a
dark
yellow
or
amber
with
a
modest
and
semicreamy
head
the
color
off
white
with
a
filmy
sheet
of
lace
to
seal
off
the
glass
the
aroma
of
ripe
fruit
like
pears
and
apples
with
a
citrus
like
semisweetness
makes
up
the
nose
start
has
a
mild
semitartness
leading
to
a
light
to
medium
top
the
finish
is
austere
in
its
acidity
with
a
pleasantly
dry
and
spicy
aftertaste
a
decent
lambic
but
there
are
many
better
its
almost
an
antithesis
to
the
cuvee
rene
94
i
tasted
at
the
same
sitting
the
color
is
darker
than
the
cuvee
rene
94
head
is
not
as
frothy
wonderful
but
less
flowery
nose
than
the
cuvee
rene
94
i
have
no
idea
how
old
the
bottles
i
have
might
be
i
purchased
them
from
a
beer
distributor
in
philadelphia
and
they
appeared
to
be
sitting
around
for
a
while
i
have
had
about
10
of
them
already
and
they
were
not
entirely
consistant
overall
there
is
little
to
no
head
to
be
seen
based
on
last
nights
tasting
the
color
is
rather
dark
amber
and
it
is
cloudy
as
it
should
be
the
yeast
smell
is
present
but
not
nearly
to
the
degree
of
a
beer
like
a
cantillon
gueuze
there
is
almost
a
sweettart
quality
to
it
i
feel
like
it
is
a
bit
thin
the
sweetness
almost
makes
me
think
there
are
cherries
in
it
to
explain
why
i
still
rated
it
as
a
4
for
drinkability
is
because
it
really
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
which
if
you
forget
about
the
fact
that
it
is
a
gueuze
and
let
it
stand
on
its
own
for
just
taste
it
can
be
rather
nice
i
found
it
to
be
refreshing
especially
in
the
summer
not
the
prettiest
beer
to
look
at
hazy
golden
color
with
little
to
no
head
what
little
head
there
was
dissipated
very
quickly
when
i
drink
my
lambics
i
want
them
to
be
tart
this
was
slightly
but
finished
with
a
slight
sweetness
basically
just
an
average
beer
i
was
excited
about
trying
this
beer
too
im
a
huge
fan
of
lambics
but
this
isnt
the
best
one
out
there
not
bad
but
a
very
timid
and
unusual
gueuze
when
compared
to
others
out
there
clear
gold
appearance
little
lasting
head
very
sweet
aroma
and
on
the
palate
in
fact
you
could
say
overly
so
just
way
too
one
dimentionally
sweet
an
easily
available
gueuze
in
belgium
but
not
one
for
us
beer
geeks
