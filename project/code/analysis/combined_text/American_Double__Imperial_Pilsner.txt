overall
interesting
beer
i
am
not
generally
a
pilsner
fan
or
lager
fan
generally
but
i
enjoyed
this
beer
more
than
i
expected
cost
5
for
a
12
oz
bottle
big
thanks
goes
out
to
oldp0rt
for
this
one
as
an
extra
in
a
recent
trade
served
from
bottle
into
a
grolsch
pilsner
poured
a
golden
yelloworange
with
a
half
finger
slightly
offwhite
head
that
remained
throughout
maintained
excellent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
fruit
grain
spice
and
alcohol
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
floral
grain
wheat
fruit
and
alcohol
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
high
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
decent
brew
i
was
really
surprised
at
how
much
alcohol
i
found
in
this
one
there
is
just
something
about
imperial
pilsners
that
dont
really
carry
enough
flavor
and
complexity
to
carry
the
alcohol
over
for
me
it
may
just
be
me
but
that
is
how
i
feel
about
the
style
as
a
whole
the
aroma
and
mouthfeel
on
this
one
were
actually
quite
nice
though
if
im
fair
just
wish
the
booziness
was
toned
back
just
a
touch
still
worth
trying
if
you
get
the
opportunity
certainly
worth
trying
at
any
rate
maybe
a
stronger
dose
of
the
noble
hops
or
something
to
combat
the
fruitiness
would
have
made
this
beer
closer
in
line
to
a
pilsner
which
would
have
been
really
something
however
erring
on
the
side
of
a
strong
ipa
is
not
a
bad
thing
either
o
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
nothing
that
makes
it
stand
out
i
did
enjoy
it
but
i
wouldnt
recommend
it
either
overall
interesting
fruit
flavours
typical
of
this
brewery
blended
into
a
nice
hoppy
pilsnerdouble
that
therefore
verges
on
a
type
of
ipa
very
easy
drinking
for
the
abv
of
8
9
which
could
mean
trouble
if
you
wanted
to
keep
drinking
this
beer
which
you
most
likely
will
good
thing
it
comes
in
packs
of
4
recommended
to
drink
in
a
proper
pilsner
glass
which
really
brought
out
more
flavours
than
when
tried
in
a
modest
tulip
ill
look
for
this
one
in
the
future
as
it
would
be
interesting
if
it
improved
or
diminishes
with
a
little
age
cheers
again
papat444
for
the
opportunity
bottle
poured
a
clear
dark
golden
color
ale
with
a
medium
size
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
minimal
lacing
aroma
of
sweet
malt
with
light
dry
hops
notes
is
interesting
taste
is
more
dominated
by
sweet
malt
notes
then
nobel
dry
hops
then
i
was
expecting
body
is
fuller
then
expected
with
good
carbonation
and
no
apparent
alcohol
interesting
take
of
the
style
but
i
would
personally
have
preferred
more
noble
hops
notes
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
its
got
some
shades
of
a
dipa
the
taste
is
bold
and
in
your
face
and
the
flavours
are
fantastic
ill
be
buying
more
of
this
one
for
sure
o
its
the
first
time
i
ever
tasted
an
imperial
pilsner
and
i
must
say
im
really
impressed
as
it
has
been
said
before
it
feels
like
a
double
ipapilsner
cross
looking
forward
to
trying
it
on
tap
very
enjoyable
definitely
worth
tasting
wishing
it
wasnt
only
brewed
in
september
overall
hop
candy
without
the
excessive
bitterness
a
really
good
beer
that
shows
no
sign
of
a
near
9
abv
taste
this
one
i
dont
think
this
would
really
be
sessionable
but
i
would
certainly
grab
a
pint
if
i
was
in
the
mood
for
a
pilsnerstyle
beer
im
not
sure
if
i
would
have
necessarily
guessed
they
were
going
for
a
pilsner
here
but
can
see
the
influence
dark
golden
near
bronze
with
a
nice
head
of
slightly
offcoloured
white
foam
that
lasts
and
leaves
decent
lacing
as
well
aromas
are
all
about
spicy
saaz
hops
a
bit
of
fusel
alcohol
and
some
nice
bready
biscuity
malts
taste
follows
suit
with
spicy
hops
fiery
booze
and
nice
malting
finish
is
not
too
dry
and
is
almost
a
bit
slick
with
no
real
booze
flavor
burn
or
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodiedfull
and
drinkability
is
quite
good
another
winner
from
ddc
im
not
suprised
at
all
deep
golden
colour
hazy
with
a
thin
lace
of
offwhite
head
strong
but
mellow
aroma
with
a
nice
balance
of
malt
almost
caramel
in
character
and
hops
its
a
little
spicy
with
a
bit
of
pine
as
well
also
a
bit
vinous
with
some
alcohol
apparent
soft
yet
strong
bitterness
seems
to
be
due
to
the
use
of
a
whole
lot
of
low
alpha
acid
hops
also
a
bit
spicy
and
malty
sweet
which
provides
a
nice
balance
alcohol
flavour
and
warmth
appear
at
the
midpoint
and
carry
through
to
the
finish
sweetness
appears
at
the
finish
as
well
along
with
peppery
phenols
and
spicy
hops
light
to
moderate
carbonation
with
a
medium
body
and
it
still
has
a
co2
crispness
and
slighty
effervescent
texture
very
interesting
tasty
beer
and
certainly
worth
a
try
received
a
bottle
bottled
91111
and
it
was
just
a
strong
lager
drinker
but
uninteresting
with
little
hop
flavour
so
i
have
averaged
my
rating
clear
shining
yellow
low
carbonation
manages
an
honest
foamy
and
sticky
white
head
field
aroma
straw
hay
spicy
hops
comes
out
peachy
and
orangey
with
grapefruity
hops
refreshing
on
the
tongue
mild
alcohol
warming
slight
grain
touch
less
sharp
and
fresh
than
rogues
but
spicier
theyre
obviously
of
similar
origins
creamy
body
smooth
carbonation
gentle
bitterness
floral
id
much
rather
have
a
light
and
crisp
helles
and
am
definitely
not
a
fan
of
imperialised
blond
lager
but
what
fool
wouldnt
welcome
a
rarity
if
all
lager
could
be
like
this
im
usually
not
a
big
fan
of
pilseners
but
seeing
as
this
is
dieu
du
ciel
i
couldnt
resist
a
pint
it
was
very
smooth
and
malty
with
just
enough
hops
to
dry
out
into
a
nice
clean
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
definately
different
from
most
pils
ive
ever
tried
this
one
had
character
and
didnt
taste
watery
at
all
and
surprisingly
it
went
down
wickedly
well
even
at
7
5
abv
you
couldnt
feel
it
at
all
superb
in
a
blind
taste
test
not
sure
i
could
tell
this
apart
from
an
iipa
but
it
does
have
a
bit
of
a
hoptomalt
character
with
little
taste
in
between
more
maltforward
as
it
warms
up
but
imo
its
best
consumed
cold
i
feel
like
this
beer
was
made
to
get
you
drunk
on
a
nice
summer
evening
with
no
questions
asked
8
7
but
by
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
youll
swear
it
was
11
good
stuff
i
was
not
really
a
big
fan
of
this
beer
my
best
succinct
description
of
it
would
be
a
syrupy
ipa
o
nice
combination
of
flavors
more
bitteraggressive
than
sierras
hoppy
lager
the
candied
fruit
sweetness
in
this
beer
saves
it
from
being
too
bitter
i
like
it
220
bottle
nice
solid
golden
clean
pour
with
a
clean
white
head
smelled
of
orange
lemon
and
fruity
hops
tasted
somewhat
bitter
hoppy
which
i
enjoyed
it
a
lot
higher
carbonation
than
expected
it
good
drinking
the
beer
felt
stronger
more
intense
afterward
than
i
expected
based
on
the
abv
but
clean
taste
and
smooth
going
down
this
is
another
very
good
offering
by
founders
and
i
look
forward
to
more
pours
of
this
and
other
offerings
down
the
road
hoppy
in
the
back
end
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
but
for
me
it
was
like
some
movies
that
won
best
picture
i
get
what
went
into
it
and
how
well
it
is
executed
but
it
just
does
not
speak
to
me
overall
a
superb
founders
limited
brew
that
has
a
bitter
earthy
fruithinted
hopbite
and
sips
quite
well
despite
it
seeming
at
times
to
exceed
the
8
7
abv
as
labeled
to
me
it
seems
a
fine
line
between
a
dipa
and
an
ipl
as
this
is
labeled
dissenters
hop
profile
reminds
me
of
stones
enjoy
by
thats
a
great
thing
o
this
is
a
great
ipl
great
hop
flavors
and
the
malt
struggles
to
balance
decent
complexity
and
a
solid
mouthfeel
as
well
not
a
lot
of
clarity
but
i
wont
hold
that
against
it
if
you
like
clean
hoppy
beers
this
is
a
good
one
to
try
excellent
beer
great
hops
awesome
aroma
golden
yellow
with
a
sprightly
white
head
smells
vociferous
with
pine
melon
and
citrus
zest
tastes
of
more
citrus
and
other
light
fruits
slight
chalk
and
cracker
in
the
middle
full
on
pine
in
the
finish
has
a
medium
wellrounded
body
alcohol
asserts
itself
in
the
end
a
grand
example
in
a
style
that
shouldnt
work
but
does
an
interesting
concoction
from
founders
in
a
relatively
new
style
the
india
pale
lager
its
hoppy
and
bitter
in
the
beginning
like
an
ipa
but
the
maltiness
comes
in
and
mellows
it
out
on
the
finish
like
a
real
lager
fairly
good
and
worth
a
try
very
crisp
and
clean
smooth
taste
o
nice
crisp
hoppy
version
of
the
hybrid
style
o
very
much
like
an
ipa
but
with
mostly
absent
malt
character
allowing
hop
aroma
flavor
and
bitterness
to
be
showcased
bitterness
might
be
a
bit
out
of
whack
but
this
is
a
very
good
imperial
pilsner
a
lot
more
interesting
than
i
expected
overall
this
isnt
a
style
im
usually
fond
of
but
this
beer
was
good
not
something
im
going
crazy
over
but
still
enjoyable
brings
out
some
deep
hop
notes
amidst
a
clean
palate
and
crispy
smooth
mouthfeel
light
floral
feel
on
the
nose
bold
and
layered
there
is
an
ipa
feel
but
this
is
rooted
firmly
in
the
lager
camp
which
sort
of
makes
it
an
odd
and
unique
hybrid
a
diversion
from
the
usual
backstage
series
offerings
but
worthy
of
a
look
nonetheless
beer
was
ok
give
it
a
try
a
solid
take
on
the
style
this
was
great
the
first
time
i
imagined
reviewing
it
and
its
remarkably
still
great
nearly
4
months
later
this
might
still
be
worth
picking
up
if
its
collecting
dust
on
a
shelf
it
does
not
reach
the
glory
of
some
of
the
hoppy
lagers
from
jacks
abby
but
thats
not
really
a
fair
comparison
nice
imperial
ipl
with
a
clear
bitterness
backed
by
a
good
deal
of
caramel
malts
i
found
the
fathom
a
bit
better
maybe
it
is
less
sweet
finally
got
my
hands
on
a
bomber
of
this
in
dec
14
ie
not
terribly
fresh
still
very
impressed
with
hoppy
highly
floral
aroma
with
a
hint
of
a
soapypiney
backbone
on
the
front
end
followed
by
a
hopwallop
that
dissipated
nicely
into
a
heavy
pilsnerlike
finish
that
was
more
like
a
smooth
slightly
barleyish
finish
overall
a
very
enjoyable
ipl
though
not
quite
up
to
the
standard
of
others
esp
those
from
jacks
abby
which
are
the
obvious
gold
standard
all
the
same
id
be
in
favor
of
founders
adding
this
to
the
yearly
seasonal
4pack
rotation
along
with
backwoods
bastard
and
dark
penance
d
this
was
a
great
ipa
not
sure
about
the
lager
part
great
crisp
scent
and
taste
the
body
was
only
ok
and
the
finish
was
a
little
hot
so
it
was
better
to
sip
still
a
delicious
brew
taste
is
potent
intense
bittering
citrus
hops
booze
is
hidden
well
in
this
wallop
of
a
lager
would
easily
double
as
a
highoctane
ipa

myself
for
not

up
more
of

highly
recommended

a

i
would

it
a
side
project

all

the

for

better
beer
and
i
love
most

beer
still
a
pretty
good
beer
but
the
sweetness

noticeable
alcohol
is
just
a
bit
much
for
me
brown

subtle
bitterness
of
unsweetened
chocolate
not
at

i
was
hoping
for
but
all
in
all
a
tasty
beer
anyway
highly
recommend
you
try
it
at
least
once
it
is
a
complex
joy
an
ipa
but
not
taste
very
hoppy
throughout
with
refreshing

leaving
the
aftertaste
of
a

a

cheers

and
the
bitterness
doesnt
linger
which
i
like
body
is
medium
and
mouthfeel
is
carbonated
just
enough
this
was
interesting
very
nice
platform
for
hops
to
just
take
the
stage
if
your
looking
for
balance
look
elsewhere
very
solid
ipl
some
real
nice
hop
flavor
def
has
serious
hoppyness
by
far
the
most
flavor
i
have
ever
gotten
out
i
a
lager
def
worth
checking
out
all
though
it
was
a
bit
pricey
humans
are
naturally
hardwired
skeptics
of
bitterness
its
in
our
dna
so
its
fair
to
say
that
most
of
us
had
to
acquire
the
taste
for
beer
and
many
never
become
comfortable
enough
with
it
to
enjoy
ipas
and
other
such
aggressively
hopped
styles
i
dont
know
why
not
for
me
overtly
tropically
hoppy
beers
like
dissenter
whether
lager
or
ale
are
pure
bliss
in
a
bottle
4
5
d
pick
this
up
its
freakin
good
o
do
i
personally
want
to
see
founders
brewing
lagers
in
place
of
ales
probably
not
not
when
there
are
already
so
many
good
ones
available
that
was
my
thinking
going
in
if
something
like
this
could
find
its
way
into
a
4
pack
through
the
summer
it
would
be
a
real
treat
its
that
tasty
the
big
bodied
stout
brewery
pulled
it
off
with
flying
colors
now
lets
get
back
to
ales
kudos
to
founders
and
this
imperial
ipl
the
dissenter
o
really
nice
a
complex
hop
bomb
o
high
drinkable
crisp
and
refreshing
and
a
nice
showcase
of
hops
well
done
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
brew
love
the
ipl
concept
3
655
a
very
nice
lager
that
thinks
its
a
dipa
shame
its
so
expensive
doesnt
touch
the
top
tier
but
the
lagering
hops
do
a
very
interesting
tango
very
good
pours
a
clear
yellowish
orange
color
with
a
big
2
head
that
slowly
falls
to
a
thick
surface
covering

highly
recommended
o
founders
hit
another
homerun
with
this
one
lots
of
bright
citrus
and
hoppy
flavors
very
delicious
beer
the
taste
is
very
smooth
with
mild
malt
that
leads
to
tangy
tinge
with
herbal
hop
flavor
bordering
on
dank
with
medium
spice

gentle
piney
almost

flavor
with
slight
lemongrass
which
leads
to
sweetened
grapefruit
and
mild

flavor
w
mild
pils
malt
backing
up
the
hops
well
there
is
only
a

in

the

low

the

in

as
it
nears
cellar
temp
with
resins
giving
a
dry
impression
in

i
consider
this
an
excellent
india
pale
lager
with
nice
amount
of

bitterness
with
nice

i
would
glady

this

o
overall
a

pale

not
much
flavor
component
crisp
use
of
lager
yeast
dry
hopped
to
the
max
warming
glow
of

shows
its
abv
a
bit
pricey
at

a
bomber
would
be
my
only
hesitation
for
recommendation
its
good
just
not
impressive
with
exception
of
the
dry
hopping
level
medium
full
body
and
medium
high
carbonation
the
carbonation
is
soft
and
fine
giving
the
beer
a
delightful
creamy
texture
o
a
very
good
beer
i
love
the
balance
on
this
one
good
amount
of
bitterness
and
body
on
this
beer
founders
is
always
so
great
o
very
clean
and
bright
well
executed
drinks
easily
for
its
size
founders
nails
its
first
foray
into
the
world
of
lagers
with
this
new
hybrid
style
overall
this
is
the
latest
release
in
founders
backstage
series
and
its
certainly
a
different
style
being
a
lager
for
them
to
take
on
like
each
member
of
the
series
the
label
is
alluring
bizarre
and
beautiful
our
first
thought
on
the
aroma
was
that
it
smelled
just
like
their
all
day
ipa
but
with
a
touch
more
sweetness
but
lets
be
real
the
most
surprising
thing
about
this
beer
is
how
dang
heavy
and
fullbodied
it
is
this
combined
with
the
penetrating
piney
bitterness
of
the
hops
makes
for
an
intense
beer
all
of
this
makes
the
drinker
sit
back
on
their
heels
a
bit
allowing
you
time
to
discuss
and
pontificate
we
are
pleased
to
have
been
able
to
try
this
offering
and
feel
it
fits
well
amongst
the
founders
pedigree
the
aromas
and
flavors
are
bold
to
the
last
drop
and
should
appease
all
but
the
most
obstinate
of
advocates
poured
from
a
bomber
into
a
shaker
pint
the
beer
is
a
bright
crystal
clear
honeygold
coloring
with
a
tall
foamy
frothy
bright
white
head
plenty
of
carbonation
moving
throughout
the
body
aromas
of
resinous
hops
with
a
richly
sweet
grapefruit
character
subtle
sugary
and
floral
highlights
and
a
solid
toasted
backbone
smells
terrific
flavors
are
resinous
forward
with
a
blast
of
pine
pitch
bitterness
grapefruit
notes
hints
of
tropical
fruits
floral
highlights
and
a
toasted
grain
backbone
once
again
the
body
is
smooth
and
big
robust
but
all
the
while
remaining
very
drinkable
the
aftertaste
is
roasty
and
toasty
with
a
hops
fingerprint
all
over
including
a
bitter
and
resin
blend
the
finish
is
smooth
and
light
with
a
subtle
crispness
dangerously
easy
to
drink
overall
better
than
most
lagers
better
than
most
ipas
not
a
bad
brew
very
interesting
and
tasty
beer
founders
does
not
let
down
this
beer
is
absolutely
delicious
i
very
much
enjoy
the
lightness
and
piney
hop
character
if
you
try
this
beer
and
do
not
love
it
shame
on
you
big
hop
bang
and
bitterness
for
a
lager
its
a
hop
bomb
with
a
pleasant
smell
though
it
looks
like
a
lager
it
tasted
like
a
west
coaststyle
ipa
to
me
i
loved
the
beer
but
the
abv
is
8
7
so
drink
this
with
caution
think
of
it
as
an
imperial
ipa
founders
dissenter
imperial
ipl
45
this
was
my
first
ipl
from
founders
and
a
very
good
one
at
that
had
it
on
tap
at
founders
and
liked
the
balance
between
malt
and
hops
it
paired
well
with
the
buffalo
chicken
sandwich
havent
had
too
many
apls
and
of
the
few
i
have
tried
none
had
done
enough
to
get
me
to
consider
myself
a
fan
of
this
style
until
i
tried
this
one
if
they
would
throw
this
in
12
oz
bottles
and
sell
4
or
6
packs
of
it
it
would
be
a
staple
in
my
fridge
pours
light
golden
yellowish
with
a
white
head
aroma
is
very
clean
and
crisp
with
some
sweet
and
citric
fruitiness
of
some
tangerines
and
grapefruit
a
touch
of
some
apricot
floral
a
little
grassy
and
a
thin
underbelly
of
some
cracker
flavor
follows
suit
really
enjoy
the
clean
crisp
finish
to
this
a
thinnish
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
love
this
beer
even
if
i
wont
spend
the
12
for
a
750
ml
bottle
of
it
any
time
i
see
it
on
tap
though
i
will
continue
to
order
it
the
flavor
matches
the
smell
with
a
bit
of
a
hoppy
kick
short
aftertaste
good
body
and
carbonation
a
pretty
aggressive
hopped
lager
the
flavor
is
all
hops
hard
to
distinguish
from
an
ale
seems
to
be
missing
that
light
fruity
note
from
the
ale
yeast

all
in
all
a
very
tasty
and
drinkable
brew
othe
backstage
series
started
out
so
strong
now
some
of
these
beers
are
good
but
nothing
great
especially
considering
the
price
tag
this
a
very
enjoyable
brew
clean
crisp
and
refreshing
any
hophead
would
appreciate
this
its
a
little
pricey
but
the
craftsmanship
is
on
point
and
takes
this
to
the
next
level
nice
color
and
lacing
very
drinkable
for
a
8

but
crisp
good
double
from
founders
o
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
good
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
solid
beer
to
drink
for
a
while
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
the
style
this
is
no
lager
but
what
it
is
is
a
very
enjoyable
brew
cheers
citrus

a

well

an
interesting
complex
beer
but
a
little
pricey
overall
very
well
balanced
tasty
and
drinkable
well
done
o
a
nice
effort
from
founders
but
nothing
i
am
dying
to
have
again
maybe
it
is
just
the
style
i
like
my
lagers
more
restrained
and
crisper
tasting
mouthfeel
is
very
dry
overall
i
like
it
the
malt
is
in
the
background
but
by
no
means
is
this
a
bitter
beer
super
smooth
and
drinkable
like
all
founders
beers
this
is
another
example
of
why
founders
is
one
of
the
best
breweries
and
happens
to
be
my
favorite
overall
very
good
ipl
but
comparatively
speaking
its
not
quite
a
great
ipl
the
hop
flavors
are
good
but
not
great
and
the
finish
is
a
bit
awkward
this
would
probably
work
better
as
a
lower
abv
ipl
to
reduce
he
malt
and
showcase
the
hops
more
definitely
glad
i
tried
as
this
is
a
style
i
love
seeing
more
of
but
i
probably
wouldnt
get
this
again
this
year
at
least
however
if
it
were
in
a
12oz
4
pack
for
12
then
i
might
86100
im
always
hesitant
when
two
styles
meld
but
this
one
definitely
comes
off
as
a
dipa
to
me
anyhow
loved
it
very
smooth
good
balance
nice
floral
o
surprised
its
much
better
than
i
thought
hello
its
founders
dummy
cheers
overall
excellent
beer
loads
of
flavor
hoppy
balanced
and
easy
enough
to
drink
really
drinks
like
a
ipa
but
the
lager
aspect
comes
in
and
really
ties
it
together
excellent
beer
got
some
sharp
citrus
in
the
nose
but
that
went
quickly
by
the
wayside
favoring
grassy
resiny
lightly
oniony
hops
for
flavoring
the
only
respite
before
the
bitterness
kicks
in
is
slightly
sweet
alcohol
laden
malt
very
earthy
and
just
not
my
style
not
a
lager
fan
and
this
is
uber
lager
overall
top
marks
a
tasty
sipper
that
could
easily
go
down
too
easy
will
have
to
pace
myself
750ml

loose
quarter

that
quickly
dissipates
into
a
sudsy
mass
towards
the

nose
is
grassy
with
a
trace
of

and
skunk
theres
also
a
suggestion
of
biscuit
malts
taste
consistent
with
nose
fortunately
the
light
skunkiness
present
in
the
nose
is
not
present
in
the
flavor
profile
definitely
a
little
more
malt
forward
than
a
typical
ipl
however
not
much
so
citrus
grassiness
and
biscuit
malts
coalesces
nicely
theres
also
a
distinct
noble
hops
bittering
and
a
trace
of
ethanol
that
lightly
lingers
between
quaffs
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
with
a
pleasant
even
carbonation
and
a
kiss
of
oiliness
to
the
texture
nothing
crazy
here
but
a
solid
representation
of
the
style
without
being
too
malty
overall
another
great
beer
from
founders
backstage
series
unfortunately
this
one
doesnt
do
quite
enough
to
stick
out
in
its
style
cool
to
see
founders
bottling
lagers
but
they
could
do
other
things
without
a
barrel
much
better
750
ml
bottle
very
drinkable
for
an
imperial
ipa
light
in
color
and
in
bitterness
but
delicious
one
of
the
better
lagers
but
still
a
lager
if
all
lagers
tasted
like
this
id
drink
them
more
often
overall
awesome
brew
and
would
definitely
grab
it
of
its
still
available
if
you
like
youre
lagers
with
a
punch
this
is
it
not
necessarily
worth
the
hype
or
price
but
it
is
worth
trying
pardon
the
pun
creamy
feel
with
a
strong
hop
character
citric
and
fruity
resinous
with
a
building
bitterness
that
lingers
into
the
aftertaste
light
mango
and
orange
notes
initially
well
built
and
drinkable
also
pretty
strong

overall
pretty
much
what
you
would
expect
from
this
style
of
beer
i
will
revisit
this
one
again
in
the
future
this
is
an
imperial
india
lager
and
it
does
an
excellent
job
of
fulfilling
all
three
descriptors
first
off
the
imperial
portion
is
obvious
as
this
has
huge
flavor
and
high
alcohol
but
no
booziness
the
india
portion
denotes
a
strong
hop
presence
of
grapefruit
herbal
tones
flower
some
citrus
sour
lemon
pine
and
resiny
bitterness
lager
is
obvious
in
a
crackerish
dry
bready
malt
backbone
this
is
a
fun
and
different
beer
with
a
strong
astringency
and
dryness

c
i
thought
drinking
a
fresh
bottle
of
this
was
very
good
nice
fruity
hops
with
a
crisp
lager
finish
overall
a
good
beer
that
covers
the
abv
well
enough
and
was
enjoyable
especially
for
a
style
i
dont
have
often
this
beer
was
confusing
a
bit
as
it
seemed
like
a
dipa
at
times
and
seemed
like
a
strong
lager
at
times
so
this
hybrid
imperial
india
pale
lager
to
me
is
a
pretty
tasty
style
since
this
beer
worked
for
me
and
i
liked
it
the
booze
was
present
the
whole
time
but
it
was
still
smooth
and
not
a
slow
sipper
definitely
worth
checking
out
overall
really
impressed
by
this
beer
will
definitely
need
to
seek
out
another
overall
the
use
of
a
lager
yeast
really
lets
the
hops
shine
through
without
being
muddled
by
any
yeast
esters
a
clean
mouthfeel
and
drier
finish
further
help
to
show
off
the
hops
and
increase
drinkability
very
nice
pours
a
beautiful
clear
gold
with
a
creamy
head
that
mostly
melts
away
fairly
quickly
but
leaves
just
enough
to
offer
some
nice
lacing
the
aroma
is
interesting
with
a
distinct
ipa
hop
profile
citrus
pine
but
a
certain
lighter
crisp
quality
to
it
the
taste
is
similar
with
a
almost
100
ipa
flavor
profile
caramel
sweetness
and
a
nice
hit
of
hops
but
theres
a
pleasant
crisp
quality
to
it
the
body
is
definitely
a
lager
but
its
not
thin
or
watery
and
holds
the
flavor
well
this
is
a
great
new
style
of
beer
one
inch
white
head
with
excellent
retention
the
aroma
of
this
beer
rivals
some
of
the
best
dipas
ive
ever
had
crisp
citrus
especially
grapefruit
the
taste
is
really
interesting
its
apparent
that
this
is
a
lager
yet
their
is
a
ton
of
hop
flavor
especially
in
the
after
taste
the
bottom
fermenting
yeasts
allow
for
the
hop
flavor
to
dominate
this
beer
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
refreshing

from

brewing
and
i
am
pleased
to

it
is
delicious
overall
i
love
this
style
of
beer
and
this
beer
is
no
exception
every
time
i
have
an
ipl
i
am
pleasantly
surprised
by
the
style
i
didnt
think
i
was
in
the
mood
for
a
hoppy
beer
tonight
but
i
guess
i
was
wrong
o

really
good
no
complaints
here
other
than
that
its
not
available
in
12oz
bottles
yearround
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
imperial
ipl
a
fun
style
o
the
alcohol
was
a
bit
much
for
me
i
think
if
this
wasnt
imperial
strength
scaled
down
it
would
have
been
world
class
but
the
alcohol
bite
took
something
away
for
me
great
beer
nonetheless
maybe
not
worth
the
price
but
something
you
dont
see
everyday

an
average
carbonation
level
there
is
also
a
strong
bitterness
fits
the
style
of
an
american
double
imperial
pilsner
tastes
of
slight
strawberry
strong
citrus
hops
sweet
malt
slight
pale

hint
of
alcohol
and
a
hint
of
pine
overall
good
appearance
decent
aroma
body
but
weak
feel
and
average
blend
overall
a
lot
has
been
said
about
this
beer
and
i
do
not
feel
it
necessary
to
repeat
it
is
a
nice
beer
though
not
one
i
would
actively
seek
o
interesting
ipl
lots
of
great
bitter
drying
hop
flavors
in
this
one
lots
of
super
pungent
super
bitter
citrus
flavors
just
enough
spiciness
to
complement
it
little
sign
of
a
malt
at
all
super
dry
and
crisp
the
aftertaste
is
like
the
sahara
desert
in
my
mouth
serving
type
bottle
nice
ipl
and
i
believe
this
is
the
first
ive
had
of
the
style
o
this
beer
reminds
me
of
an
ipadipa
in
the
flavor
and
aroma
only
the
crispclean
mouthfeel
is
what
makes
me
know
that
is
one
is
a
lager
pretty
easy
to
drink
with
the
well
hidden
alcohol
and
really
enjoyable
flavors
o
taste
is
nice
and
makes
me
regret
not
drinking
more
of
the
great
lakes
silver
and
gold
ipl
that
was
about
11
a
4pk
in
2013
if
this
was
in
4
packs
and
priced
the
same
i
would
fill
my
fridge
o
just
ok
its
got
a
really
weird
hop
profile
that
kinda
pulls
it
down
a
little
overall
ive
been
blessed
to
drink
this
while
its
around
a
couple
generous
folks
out
there
including
some
strangers
who
saw
me
sitting
in
a
store
without
the
beer
she
decided
based
on
the
other
beers
i
was
drinking
that
i
deserved
to
have
the
last
bottle
of
this
beer
to
go
however
i
cracked
it
with
a
new
friend
and
fellow
italiano
that
day
giant
eagle
market
district
robinsons
tasting
bar
overall
a
really
solid
beer
very
enjoyable
you
can
definitely
tell
this
is
a
lager
but
it
is
still
really
hoppy
like
an
iipa
good
stuff
other
than
harvest
ale
this
might
be
my
favorite
hoppy
beer
founders
does
it
worked
really
well
flavor
îs
milder
than
the
aroma
suggests
at
least
at
first
with
a
solid
light
malt
base
the
finish
and
aftertaste
had
the
hop
power
of
an
ipa
mouthfeel
has
to
be
the
absolute
best
part
100100
with
how
flavorful
this
beer
is
its
a
light
to
medium
feel
not
heavy
at
all
yet
it
has
a
lingering
flavor
strong
carbonation
without
being
fizzy
and
doesnt
bite
at
all
starts
sweet
and
gradually
goes
to
the
appropriate
amount
of
bitterness
leading
to
a
nice
hoppy
dry
and
very
clean
bitter
finish
balance
is
perfect
and
its
crazy
drinkable
i
was
literally
disappointed
when
i
emptied
this
bottle
if
this
were
sold
in
sixfour
packs
i
would
love
it
nice
job
founders
this
is
a
phenominal
beer
and
an
imperial
ipl
like
this
holds
breweries
like
jacks
abby
the
best
brewery
at
lagering
in
my
opinion
in
check
this
is
a
great
drinkable
beer
that
i
hope
isnt
a
one
time
brew
special
thanks
to
bin
ends
braintree
for
saving
me
a
bottle
dissenter
is

its
everything
most
imperial
ipls
try
to
be
and
fail
founders
nailed
this
guy
and
while
this
is
still
a
bit
of
an
odd
style
to
me
at
times
this
version
works
well
as
usual
go
buy
this
beer
that
founders
brewed
you
wont
be
disappointed
o
definitely
an

o
a
great
beer
overall
its
called
a
lager
but
its
name
is
pretty
much
the
only
thing
lagery
about
it
that
doesnt
stop
it
from
being
really
good
though
o
really
reminds
me
more
of
a
dipa
as
im
not
getting
the
maltysweetness
i
expect
with
imperial
lagers
but
still
a
wellmade
tasty
beer
and
definitely
recommended

you
like
that

i
tried
this
on
tap
at
founders
on
the
day
of
release
i
like
todays
offering
better
it
is
loaded
with
aroma
and
flavor
and
i
like
how
the
malt
mellows
it
from
being
really
bitter
beer
the
slick
mouthfeel
seals
the
deal
for
me
onice
complexity
of
flavor
and
easy
drinking
in
spite
of
the
abv
hopefully
this
signals
an
uptick
for
the
backstage
series
an
uninspired
beer
where
jacks
abby
has
been
brewing
this
style
better
for
years
lagers
are
not
my
favorite
but
this
was
ok
approached
a
double
ipa
but
had
a
bit
of
a
lager
graininess
overall
its
drinkable
but
i
much
prefer
iipa
over
iipa
overall
i
have
never
been
thrilled
by
imperial
pilsners
and
this
one
is
no
exception
i
often
find
them
too
sweet
and
that
is
the
case
here
as
well
overall
not
my
favorite
ipa
or
ipl
flavors
this
definitely
beats
you
down
with
hop
resin
and
bitterness
i
guess
in
an
attempt
to
prove
that
lagers
can
be
imperial
as
well
the
nice
mouthfeel
lessens
the
impact
somewhat
in
a
good
way
but
its
still
kind
of
an
overhopped
monster
old

better
than

recommendation
if
youre
a
big
fan
of
founders
or
the
lager
style
definitely
try
this
beer
the
taste
brings
back
some
of
the
flavors
i
originally
smelled
light
flavored
pitted
fruit
flavors
combined
nicely
with
a
honey
sweetness
but
also
a
nice
strain
of
light
pine
woodiness
the
beer
is
a
bit
sweeter
than
is
like
especially
on
first
sip
but
also
has
a
good
dose
of
bitterness
to
counter
it
i
definitely
would
have
trouble
telling
the
was
a
lager
o
i
kind
of
wish
the
malt
presence
was
a
tad
bit
higher
but
other
than
that
this
is
a
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
ipl
this
is
the
best
ipl
i
have
had
to
datethe
hops
are
dripping
in
the
nose
and
are
spot
on
the
palatejust
a
great
beer
overall
surprisingly
good
i
expected
something
overly
sweet
but
this
has
a
nice
hop
flavor
and
a
balanced
malt
character
their
take
on
it
but
iwould
love
to
see
this
in
4packs
next
year
4
5
o
good
drinks
more
like
a
dipa
than
a
lager
but
then
i
think
thats
kind
of
the
point
of
this
style
overall
another
gem
from
the
backstage
series
emphasis
on
the
imperial
in
this
iipl
the
aroma
is
certainly
of
a
big
dipa
but
the
taste
reminds
to
this
is
just
a
massively
hopped
lager
glad
i
should
be
easily
able
to
pick
up
a
few
more
bottles
of
this
the
aroma
is
filled
with
citrus
with
lots
of
orange
lemon
peel
and
some
peach
in
the
taste
these
are
toned
down
somewhat
there
is
also
an
almost
complete
lack
of
malt
backbone
what
malt
is
there
only
adds
a
slight
breadycracker
ness
to
the
beer
being
a
ipl
this
is
to
be
somewhat
expected
i
only
wish
the
malt
would
have
kicked
up
just
a
bit
o
really
an
outstanding
beer
its
just
shy
of
the
best
and
not
by
much
o
overall
a
very
nice
lager
if
they
made
this
all
the
time
and
knocked
it
down
to
12
oz
4packs
id
buy
it
all
the
time
hoppy
and
easy
to
drink
well
worth
checking
out
delicious
i
was
lucky
enough
to
score
a
bomber
which
i
shared
with
my
son
23
y
o
who
seldom
agrees
with
my
tastes
in
beer
he
liked
this
as
much
as
i
did
goes
down
smooth
and
easy
one
of
the
best
tasting
beers
ive
had
in
a
long
time
founders
scores
again
total
3750
altogether
a
very
agressive
beer
featuring
strong
hop
flavors
enjoyable
without
any
glaring
flaws
but
i
dont
find
all
the
pieces
of
the
puzzle
coming
together
cohesively
the
malt
gives
a
sticky
sweet
finish
and
the
hops
can
be
a
little
strong
and
almost
astringent
solid
hoppy
lager
coming
from
founders
but
the
one
problem
i
have
is
the
heavy
zesty
bitterness
and
high
carbonation
combining
to
a
bit
harsh
this
distracts
somewhat
from
the
other
flavors
overall
a
quite
enjoyable
and
robust
ipl
crisp
and
refreshing
as
a
lager
should
be
but
nicely
hoped
as
a
double
imperial
should
be
rather
well
done
dissenter
is
the
best
example
of
a
hopped
up
lager
ive
tried
yet
the
body
is
remarkably
light
and
refreshing
for
a
brew
with
such
an
alcoholic
heft
and
this
goes
down
dangerously
easily
ive
strayed
away
from
this
style
for
the
most
part
but
might
have
to
give
it
a
little
more
attention
after
enjoying
this
delicious

overall

just
stoked
to
find
a

bomber
this

but
damn
tasty
either
way
definitely
a
solid

hoppy
lager
very
enjoyable
a
very
tasty
and
drinkable
ipainspired
lager
that
comes
across
like
a
pilsner
with
some
alelike
characteristics
goes
down
easy
and
doesnt
really
let
on
its
strength
at
first
although
it
warms
a
bit
later
on
pretty
great
and
worth
a
try
the
overall
rating
for
this
beer
seemed
a
bit
low
to
me
at
first
but
i
can
understand
why
i
think
it
tastes
quite
familiar
but
with
a
pretty
big
bump
on
the
price
tag
not
sure
id
buy
this
again
with
cheaper
beers
tasting
a
bit
similar
to
this
one
but
this
is
still
a
world
class
sort
of
imperial
ipa
well
lager
that
deserves
your
attention
one
of
my
very
favorite
beers
of
2014
o
an
extremely
well
done
hopforward
iipl
very
easy
to
drink
given
the
abv
and
hoppiness
a
very
nice
surprise
in

they
havent
brewed
a
lager
in
over
a
decade
highly
recommended
oa
tasty

lager
maybe
not
worth
the
money
but
i
trust
the
company
overall
very
nice
indeed
was
lucky
enough
to
land
several
bottles
of
blushing
monk
and
3
of
cbs
this
is
not
those
but
no
matter
to
me
kudos
for
founders
trying
new
stuff
as
usual
this
is
better
than
it
ought
to
be

theres

grassy

with

mouthfeebody
is
medium
its
smooth
and
a

think
its
a
good
brew
certainly
worth
a
try
11
99
a
bottle
o
big
ol
hopbomb
of
a
beer
reasonably
priced
would
have
liked
a
little
more
lageristic
crispness
and
a
little
less
booze
but
definitely
something
i
could
drink
regularly
o
struck
me
as
a
pilsener
in
the
style
of
an
ipa
with
some
extra
abv
thrown
in
for
good
measure
i
suppose
fans
of
pilseners
and
ipas
and
pale
ales
in
general
will
enjoy
this
not
as
crisp
or
refreshing
as
pilseners
usually
are
reasonably
priced
for
founders
and
worth
a
buy
and
try
overall
a
very
solid
take
on
a
hopped
up
lager
big
citrus
and
pine
notes
with
a
solid
malt
backing
a
lot
like
double
trouble
with
a
lager
background
glad
i
tried
it
but
id
probably
search
for
a
more
adventurous
ipaipl
if
i
am
going
to
pay
the
price
i
paid
for
this
overall
ok
this
is
a
tasty

theres
nothing
like
a
pilsner
here

maybe
great

some
palettes

simmered

to

could

the
fact
that
this
was
a
lager
taste
was
pretty
much
fullblown
lagertown
bready
yeasty
caramel
the
hops
bringing
in
a
dull
bitterness
and
the
freshness
of
the
aroma
just
not
carrying
through
into
the
taste
some
solventy
booze
heat
in
there
as
well
sensing
every
bit
of
the
8
7abv
body
was
pretty
big
actually
and
on
the
fuller
side
of
medium
which
i
didnt
much
care
for
chewy
syrupy
and
obviously
maltdriven
to
get
that
abv
up
got
exponentially
worse
as
the
beer
sat
came
up
closer
to
room
temp
this
one
just
didnt
do
anything
for
me
came
off
like
an
ipa
that
was
way
past
its
prime
a
very
enjoyable
beer
that
has
some
really
clean
hop
flavors
overall
a
really
nice
smooth
hoppy
balanced
big
ipl
definitely
well
done
the
lagering
process
payed
off
here
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
guy
o
this
is
yet
another
well
made
beer
from
founders
easy
to
drink
with
a
lot
of
character
served
on

at
bigbys
pour
house
pours
a
nice
and
bright
clear
gold
with
some
soapy
white
head
nose
is
delightfully
hoppy
with
and
emphasis
on
floral
notes
paired
with
some
heavy
cereal
malt
character
the
hop
present
with
some
leafy
grassy
notes
flowers
and
pine
taste
has
a
heavy
bitterness
throughout
the
lager
components
are
noteable
throughout
as
the
is
less
of
that
fruity
ale
component
and
more
of
that
dry
grain
lager
quality
the
floral
hops
come
through
strongly
and
make
for
a
resinous
finish
mouthfeel
is
exceptionally
light
for
the
weight
of
this
beer
overall
decent
brew
with
a
nice
hop
profile
and
it
sets
itself

sweet

pineapple

white

some

as
well
the

there
is
still
the
citrus

tropical

some

pretty
noticeable
alcohol

with
grapefruit
and
some

dank

lots
of

mouthfeel
is

has
a

of
carbonation
overall
im
very
happy
with
this
one
and
it
is
certainly
one
of
the
best
of
the
style
i
have
had
to
date
overall

this
is
plenty
enjoyable
no
question
about
it
it
didnt
live
up
to
its
potential
thoughonly
jacks
abby
has
really
nailed
the
imperial
ipl
from
what
ive
seen
anyway
what
this
does
do
is
offer
a
drinkable
beer
thats
india
first
imperial
second
pale
third
and
lager
last
if
thats
what
youre
looking
for
in
a
beer
like
this
then
youll
be
very
pleased
if
youre
looking
for
a
big
lager
thats
hoppy
as
hell
it
wont
hit
a
bullseye
but
itll
do
just
fine
overall
its
a
big
style
blur
since
the
hop
forward
quality
hints
at
a
classic
american
ipa
with
much
classic
lager
character
hardly
distinguishable
if
left
to
pasture
its
probably
not
what
i
am
looking
for
in
a
lager
but
its
a
neat
creative
bent
and
certainly
drinkable
and
enjoyable
good
for
founders
mor
mixing
it
up
a
bit
fantastic
aroma
juicy
fresh
hops
clean
with
nothing
to
mess
up
the
beautiful
aroma
of
the
hops
mouthfeel
was
crisp
like
a
lager
should
be
followed
by
a
sticky
juicy
exposed
hop
flavor
the
hops
tasted
like
they
were
naked
with
nothing
there
to
cover
them
up
and
they
stood
tall
letn
it
all
be
exposed
the
finish
was
dry
with
a
slight
almost
forgettable
slick
oily
at
the
back
of
yer
throat
persistent
lingering
hop
taste
that
clings
to
yer
teeth
and
gums
wowit
tastes
so
clean
yet
i
feel
so
dirty
o
i
havent
had
too
many
hoppy
lagers
but
this
is
definitely
the
best
one
ive
had
it
slight
edges
out
shorts
mmmkay
because
of
its
restrained
bitterness
the
price
point
was
still
a
bit
high
especially
when
i
could
get
a
6pack
of
mmmkay
an
equally
hopped
beer
for
the
same
price
still
a
great
beer
and
hope
to
see
more
midwest
hoppy
lagers
like
this
one
in
the
future
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
good
beer
and
i
thought
it
was
a
very
nice
example
of
a
hoppy
lager
it
did
a
really
great
job
at
showcasing
those
great
fruity
hops
and
the
clean
lager
base
seemed
to
work
well
with
the
hop
profile
and
it
let
the
citra
hops
really
shine
this
beer
had
good
drinkability
it
was
smooth
clean
crisp
slightly
oily
slightly
sticky
not
too
filling
and
the
taste
did
a
good
job
of
holding
my
attention
i
think
one
glass
would
be
a
good
amount
for
me
but
i
know
i
wouldnt
have
a
problem
drinking
a
full
bottle
but
that
would
be
my
limit
and
i
think
it
makes
for
a
nice
beer
to
enjoy
on
a
warm
summer
evening
what
i
like
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
hop
profile
it
was
very
nice
and
it
had
all
those
fruity
hop
flavors
that
i
love
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
nothing
there
isnt
anything
that
i
disliked
or
would
change
its
fine
just
the
way
it
is
i
would
buy
another
bottle
of
this
before
its
all
gone
but
i
dont
think
ill
be
clearing
the
shelfs
of
it
especially
for
11
49
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
who
likes
hoppy
lagers
or
just
hoppy
beers
a
general
i
think
its
pretty
much
a
must
try
for
all
hop
heads
all
in
all
i
was
pretty
happy
with
this
beer
i
was
expecting
good
things
since
this
is
a
founders
backstage
release
and
they
delivered
a
very
nice
and
hoppy
lager
so
far
i
think
this
is
the
best
hoppy
lager
ive
had
and
its
for
sure
the
best
lager
of
the
summer
but
it
isnt
a
favorite
founders
beer
great
job
guys
i
really
like
how
the
only
thing
that
i
can
always
expect
from
this
series
it
thats
its
going
to
be
a
great
and
unique
beer
and
thats
exactly
what
it
was
keep
up
the
hard
work
guys
o
really
enjoyed
this
beer
i
would
love
to
see
this
become
a
seasonal
release
delicious
bottle
from
gator
bev
pours
beautiful
clear
golden
with
a
one
finger
white
head
aroma
is
pretty
much
just
like
double
trouble
lots
of
grapefruit
pineapple
citrus
rinds
a
bit
of
mango
some
pale
malt
sweetness
flavor
is
strong
citrus
and
tropical
pineapple
a
bitter
pine
finish
and
some
definite
caramel
malt
presence
finishes
less
crisp
than
a
pale
ale
and
longer
smooth
lager
yeast
notes
if
you
try
hard
to
find
them
medium
plus
bodied
with
medium
plus
carbonation
this
is
good
but
really
just
a
very
solid
dipa
with
what
seems
to
be
a
bit
more
malt
heft
pours
a
slightly
hazy
deep
straw
color
with
a
huge
tightly
bubbled
white
head
that
shows
moderate
retention
and
some
sticky
lace
aromas
of
sour
pink
grapefruit
some
pine
and
resin
with
a
hint
of
menthol
and
mint
very
faint
crackery
malt
deep
underneath
the
flavor
is
intense
sour
grapefruit
with
hints
of
pine
resin
and
earth
still
very
faint
malt
deep
underneath
medium
body
with
moderate
carbonation
intensely
bitter
but
i
couldnt
stop
drinking
it
the
hops
are
a
bit
of
an
odd
combination
and
at
first
i
was
a
little
put
off
but
about
half
a
glass
in
i
was
drinking
this
like
a
champ
overall
big
hoppy
lager
pulled
off
pretty
well
almost
reminded
me
of
southern
tier
unearthly
in
lager
form
the
sweetness
was
a
bit
much
to
start
but
it
eventually
came
together
nicely
glad
they
went
for
a
different
route
for
this
style
than
jacks
abby
three
of
us
tried
a
bomber
of
dissenter
this
weekend
and
none
of
was
impressed
with
it
overall
we
decided
that
we
have
been
spoiled
by
fiddlehead
second
fiddle
and
that
every
ipa
from
here
on
out
is
going
to
be
disappointing
normally
we
consider
founders
to
be
among
the
top
brewers
in
the
country
we
still
do
however
dissenter
was
not
one
of
their
best
products
we
would
can
it
no
pun
intended
bold
and
bitter
citruspine
hops
smells
and
tastes
like
a
double
ipa
but
drinks
like
a
session
ale
very
crushable
on
a
hot
summer
day
light
body
with
a
crisp
bubbly
finish
i
laugh
at
those
who
balked
at
the
idea
of
founders
making
a
lager
because
they
nailed
it
with
this
one
its
building
bitterness
is
unrelenting
as
the
hops
grip
the
throat
tightly
and
refuses
to
release
gaining
bitterness
sip
after
sip
its
grassy
herbal
and
woodish
spices
tighten
their
grip
weaving
in
citrus
piths
leaf
and
grass
along
the
way
en
route
to
a
piquant
alcohol
warmth
thats
indicative
of
its
high
strength
its
mild
astringency
is
unavoidable
with
not
malt
taste
or
texture
to
buffer
out
the
hop
and
alcohol
rougher
edges
o
a
very
nice
change
of
pace
from
the
usual
fare
strikes
me
as
a
well
timed
summer
beer
overall
i
will
buying
more
of
this
really
a
great
beer
as
i
come
expect
from
founders
i
traveled
with
this
from
nj
to
dom
rep
because
theres
only
so
much
presidente
one
can
take
my
brotherinlaw
and
i
split
a
bottle
in
pilsner
glasses
drinkable
and
refreshing
but
has
noticeable
substance
and
bodyi
suppose
therein
lies
its
imperial
quality
crisp
pilsner
flavor
with
no
sense
of
the
higher
alcohol
content

great
tasting
o
strong
pilsner
just
like
the
name
implies
bitter
great
spin
on
a
pilsner
strong
overall
not
a
big
rogue
fan
but
this
is
nice
well
crafted
brew
i
found
a
place
that
still
has
a
few
bottles
of
it
for
sale
so
ill
need
to
pick
a
few
up
and
rereview
it
but
im
excited
to
have
more
of
it
o
this
is
definitely
the
most
bitter
lager
i
have
ever
had
and
right
up
there
with
the
most
bitter
beers
i
have
ever
had
really
nice
crisp
pilsner
mouthfeel
with
a
little
more
body
and
good
flavor
found
this
brew
a
relatively
rare
style
in
these
parts
on
tap
at
national
beer
hall
in
calgary
on
10th
ave
missed
out
on
the
funky
bottle
but
oh
well
arrived
in
a
pint
glass
a
cloudy
gold
amber
color
that
is
of
course
is
on
the
light
end
of
the
lovabond
scale
but
still
manages
to
look
thick
and
imposing
smells
of
concentrated
sweet
grains
a
pungent
fruity
note
like
grape
juice
another
sweet
note
almost
like
brown
sugar
and
aggressive
grassy
green
hops
all
of
these
elements
are
reflected
in
the
taste
nothing
tastes
quite
like
an
imperial
pils
this
one
is
at
once
rich
and
sweet
chalky
and
woody
almost
carbolic
and
features
a
heady
mix
of
green
and
spicy
hop
flavors
along
with
some
equally
spicy
aromatic
alcohol
the
thick
and
chewy
body
and
buttery
mouthfeel
make
things
even
more
satiating
i
get
heavy
sweet
dough
dried
fruits
currants
sultana
raisins
candy
apple
and
an
oaky
dryness
that
does
work
to
cut
the
sweet
grains
to
some
extent
the
hops
provide
some
additional
woody
tannic
bitterness
and
funky
gooseberry
notes
and
pine
in
the
finish
a
big
beer
with
considerable
decoction
malt
and
hop
power
a
pint
is
a
lot
to
get
through
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
the
imperialized
pilsner
concept
is
a
little
strange
especially
in
this
example
the
bitterness
doesnt
seem
imperialized
but
the
alcohol
and
sweetness
sure
is
that
sweetness
distracts
a
little
and
ruins
the
overall
snap
crispness
and
ease
of
drinkability
i
look
for
in
a
good
pils
worth
trying
but
i
probably
would
not
revisit
this
again
could
use
a
bit
more
carbonation

overall
this
is

style
all
around
nice
balance
of

yeast
flavors
and
very
smooth
to
sip
on
for
the
abv
a
very
enjoyable
offering
didnt
expect
to
enjoy
this
nearly
as
much
as
i
did
very
impressive
flavour
profile
i
thought
they
were
done
with
the
morimoto
brews
so
when
i
saw
this
i
had
to
pick
it
up
ignoring
the
20
dollar
price
tag
because
morimoto
is
just
a
boss
the
boss
of
bosses
anyways
this
pilsner
pours
bright
honey
colored
yellow
with
a
colossal
white
head
that
doesnt
relax
much
at
all
the
nose
is
a
little
sweet
a
little
floral
and
hopped
with
some
noble
variety
that
really
gives
a
nod
to
tradition
in
the
genre
pushing
bomb
the
flavor
is
well
balanced
and
surprisingly
interesting
for
a
pils
which
i
usually
find
so
uneventful
floral
hop
profile
grassy
malt
bill
and
some
excellent
yeast
that
is
light
but
ties
the
whole
thing
together
and
tames
the
alcohol
which
is
expertly
hidden
would
never
know
this
was
almost
9
abv
feel
is
nice
too
fuller
bodied
for
the
style
and
well
carbonated
sort
of
a
richness
to
this
that
cool
it
trumps
out
the
refreshing
qualities
usually
found
in
a
pilsner
but
it
also
adds
an
element
of
class
and
satisfaction
i
dont
usually
come
away
with
from
a
pils
overall
an
excellent
brew
expensive
but
damn
good
overall
a
big
tasty
pils
i
am
not
sure
i
love
this
one
all
to
much
it
has
a
lot
of
flavor
but
nothing
compared
to
ales
of
similar
strength
i
would
recommend
it
to
anyone
who
is
on
the
fence
about
it
and
i
am
sure
i
will
try
it
again
if
you
enjoy
a
good
imperial
pilsner
or
other
rogues
or
are
feeling
like
treating
yourself
i
recommend
this
one
let
me
preface
this
review
by
saying
that
i
dont
normally
enjoy
pilsners
mostly
because
i
dislike
the
czech
yeast
finish
that
being
said
this
beer
was
amazing
it
poured
a
hazy
golden
straw
colour
from
a
very
cool
ceramic
potstopper
bottle
the
first
flavour
that
struck
me
was
honey
thick
mellow
warming
honey
it
had
much
less
carbonation
than
normal
pilsners
which
i
welcomed
because
it
complemented
the
flavour
better
this
way
the
typical
czech
yeast
finish
was
totally
buried
in
honey
with
some
grass
and
a
pinch
of
hops
if
it
wasnt
18
a
bottle
i
would
definitely
buy
this
very
regularly
ceramic
bottle
a
dark
golden
beer
with
a
bubbly
whipped
cream
like
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
sweet
malty
with
a
strong
hop
presence
giving
it
notes
of
grass
herbs
and
citrus
the
flavor
is
sweet
malty
at
first
but
very
soon
first
the
hops
hits
the
tongue
with
notes
of
grass
grapefruit
hay
and
herbs
and
then
the
alcohol
comes
a
long
with
a
power
that
makes
its
presence
known
then
the
alcohol
resides
a
bit
to
leave
a
quite
acidic
grapefruity
note
towards
the
quite
bitter
end
now
this
is
a
complex
interpretation
of
a
pilsner
o
im
not
a
huge
pilsner
fan
but
this
beer
kicks
ass
very
tasty
and
enough
alcohol
to
make
it
interesting
o
dont
believe
ive
ever
had
an
imperial
pilsner
definitely
enjoying
this
much
sweeter
and
maltier
than
a
classic
pilsner
making
it
interesting
and
tasty
o
pretty
much
what
i
expected
when
the
bottle
says
imperial
pilsner
you
think
pilsner
kicked
up
a
notch
im
usually
not
a
fan
of
rogue
but
this
is
a
good
one
and
could
lead
others
from
the
bmc
category
o
i
have
only
had
one
other
imperial
pilsner
that
i
can
recall
it
was
a
local
holy
city
trippin
brick
and
it
was
amazing
after
having
my
first
rogue
xs
imperial
ipa
and
being
totally
blown
away
i
was
pretty
pumped
for
this
one
although
this
is
definitely
a
decent
brew
there
is
no
way
i
will
ever
pay
16
99
for
this
one
again
the
bottle
alone
is
awesome
and
worth
at
least
7
or
8
i
would
think
but
this
beer
just
wasnt
quite
special
enough
for
me
to
spend
that
kind
of
money
on
2
brews
again
the
review
is
based
on
quality
not
taking
price
into
consideration
im
giving
it
a
3
5
because
taste
is
most
important
and
it
was
sadly
my
least
favorite
part
of
this
one
overall
not
even
a
taste
of
alcohol
heat
but
its
a
one
trick
pony
beer
but
boy
what
a
trick
it
is
it
gets
strangely
a
bit
more
interesting
as
it
warms
up
which
is
not
how
i
would
want
this
style
but
regardless
this
is
one
impressive
pilsner
and
its
quite
shocking
they
pulled
this
off
overall
this
is
an
excellent
beer
the
flavor
profile
is
complex
and
bold
as
one
would
expect
from
an
imperial
the
aroma
and
mouthfeel
accompany
the
flavor
very
well
to
create
an
enjoyable
beer
the
ceramic
bottle
with
the
resealable
top
add
a
nice
touch
although
entirely
unnecessary
this
is
a
good
beer
it
was
a
different
experience
from
any
other
beer
i
have
had
oa
good
beer
a
good
pilsner
with
lots
of
flavor
nice
body
to
it
as
well
food
pairing
grilled
fish
tacos
or
a
pineapple
empanada
o
i
tend
to
dislike
strong
lagers
but
this
one
was
a
pleasant
surprise
easily
the
best
lager
ive
tried
from
rogue
overall
havent
had
too
many
nice
pilsners
but
this
is
certainly
one
of
them
overall
pretty
much
love
all
of
the
rogue
beers
that
come
in
the
ceramic
bottles
and
this
one
is
no
different
nice
beer
very
over
priced
yellowish
with
a
huge
fluffy
white
head
smell
is
solid
but
for
16
99
better
blow
me
away
if
i
am
going
to
purchase
twice
taste
is
better
and
more
bitter
then
smell
mouthfeel
is
very
solid
overall
nice
beer
in
my
opinion
but
step
back
and
improve
the
price
i
would
have
gotten
into
more
detail
but
my
kids
prevented
me
from
writing
as
i
was
drinking
the
brew
pours
a
slightly
hazy
golden
straw
hue
and
is
capped
with
a
good
bit
of
soapy
froth
lemongrass
and
bright
citrus
hop
notes
are
noted
in
the
nose
and
upon
the
palate
and
sit
upon
a
light
pale
grainy
malt
base
the
whole
thing
is
very
smooth
with
a
nice
mouthfeel
fairly
refreshing
and
sans
indication
of
the
high
abv
overall
fairly
delicious
and
better
than
most
rogue
brews
this
is
an
interesting
beer
i
appreciate
what
theyve
done
here
but
for
me
its
a
touch
to
syrupy
and
sweet
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
pretty
clear
looking
golden
yellow
color
the
head
was
white
and
fluffy
at
first
as
it
settled
the
lacing
was
light
and
didnt
do
too
much
the
smell
of
the
beer
wasnt
overly
grassy
which
i
was
happy
about
the
aromas
were
a
little
grainy
and
hoppy
the
taste
was
better
than
expected
the
flavors
of
some
sweeter
malts
were
upfront
that
faded
into
a
subtle
bitterness
at
the
end
the
mouthfeel
was
pretty
slick
not
too
heavy
or
overly
carbonated
overall
this
beer
wasnt
too
bad
best
of
the
morimoto
series
that
ive
had
for
sure
the
overall
i
was
pretty
surprised
with
what
a
tasty
brew
this
was
i
guess
what
else
can
you
expect
from
such
a
great
brewery
wow
i
was
surprised
by
this
beer
im
not
really
a
pilsner
guy
but
this
one
was
highly
recommended
from
he
tap
iot
pours
golden
with
a
dry
hopped
nose
very
thin
mouthfeel
starts
like
a
pilsner
finishes
like
a
malty
ipa
with
a
hoppy
finish
that
is
uncharacteristic
of
a
pilsner
but
is
necessary
because
of
the
abv
i
really
enjoyed
this
brew
opinion
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
it
is
a
bit
aggressive
on
the
hops
where
i
really
dont
think
that
it
needs
to
be
and
this
pushes
it
out
of
the
pilsner
feel
for
me
overall
it
is
more
like
an
imperial
ipa
with
german
ingredients
i
will
certainly
finish
the
whole
thing
but
it
will
be
a
while
before
i
decide
i
need
to
try
this
again
d
big
malty
and
bitter
hoppy
beer
made
it
balance
abv
a
little
daunting
it
was
pricey
too
d
morimoto
is
an
amazing
imperial
pils
loved
it
this
is
a
huge
pils
hop
bomb
that
still
retains
its
crispness
and
drinkability
which
is
what
i
really
love
about
the
pilsner
style
this
one
just
adds
a
ton
of
hops
which
makes
it
all
the
more
tasty
plus
this
wasnt
as
alcoholic
as
some
other
imperial
pils
ive
had
in
the
past
no
alcohol
sting
but
plenty
of
hop
sting
that
said
i
dont
think
this
beer
is
worth
the
money
that
you
pay
for
it
ive
felt
this
before
that
rogue
makes
very
solid
brews
for
way
too
much
money
i
really
like
this
beer
pretty
easy
to
put
a
whole
750
back
and
my
roommate
and
i
burned
through
the
growler
i
had
pretty
quickly
the
price
of
the
bottle
may
turn
some
away
but
if
you
can
get
it
fresh
on
tapgrowler
id
give
it
a
shot
d
average
to
good
i
am
not
impressed
to
say
the
least
take
away
the
fact
that
an
imperial
pilsner
is
an
oxymoron
this
is
just
bad
in
any
regard
sorry
but
a
big
miss
and
something
that
i
will
avoid
if
i
ever
see
it
again
tasty
and
refreshing
great
imperial
pils
hoppy
and
bitter
ok
this
beer
is
really
oddly
super
bitter
its
kind
of
disturbing
its
kind
of
sweet
medium
bodied
and
really
really
bitter
its
almost
fruity
in
the
middle
but
the
bitterness
lingers
its
a
big
bottle
and
i
made
it
through
the
whole
thing
but
i
doubt
ill
drink
it
again
highly
drinkable
id
definitley
order
another
aroma
is
of
fruity
malt
and
apple
cider
although
without
any
ester
taste
that
could
be
expected
from
an
8
8
brew
this
pilsner
is
labeled
as
74ibu
but
the
hop
bitterness
is
so
well
integrated
that
there
is
no
way
that
this
number
could
be
guessed
this
is
probably
due
to
the
obviously
large
malt
presence
these
two
components
are
so
large
in
this
brew
that
any
change
could
cause
the
flavor
profile
to
go
awry
but
the
balance
between
malt
and
hops
is
perfect
this
superbig
but
suspiciously
wellbalanced
beer
plus
its
hefty
8
8abv
makes
this
is
highly
drinkable
beer
this
is
an
incredibly
expensive
beer
so
its
not
for
everyday
but
it
is
one
that
deserves
its
place
at
special
occasions
recommended
taste
thick
mouthfeel
but
light
malts
overtones
of
straw
and
caramel
slightly
bitter
orange
oil
as
well
which
sweetens
up
in
the
middle
which
has
notes
of
tree
bark
in
a
pleasant
way
light
white
rice
caramel
and
more
straw
white
grape
skin
come
in
toward
the
finish
finish
is
yeasty
a
little
boozy
and
herbal
lingers
fairly
long
and
has
a
touch
of
dry
bitter
herbs
double
pilsners
the
more
of
them
i
drink
the
less
i
like
them
i
think
its
a
style
that
is
very
difficult
to
do
well
part
of
the
beauty
of
a
pilsner
for
me
is
that
a
beer
can
be
light
and
refreshing
but
still
complex
and
flavorful
this
beer
is
heavy
and
cloying
and
doesnt
resemble
light
or
refreshing
in
any
way
the
malt
is
sticky
sweet
and
drowns
out
any
hope
of
balance
the
alcohol
flavor
is
pretty
unwelcome
not
sure
i
would
buy
again
only
because
expensive
pilsners
is
not
my
typical
expenditure
if
i
was
forced
to
buy
pilsners
this
would
prolly
end
up
at
the
top
of
my
list
overall
a
top
notch
imperial
pilsner
i
liked
this
a
lot
and
despite
the
steep
price
i
will
probably
grab
one
of
these
from
time
to
time
very
nice
d
this
was
a
decent
imperial
pilsner
it
could
have
used
a
better
nose
but
i
did
like
the
balance
of
malt
and
hops
d
drinkable
but
not
more
than
a
standard
german
pils
if
you
just
keep
pounding
away
like
you
would
on
one
of
them
the
alcohol
could
really
sneak
up
on
you
good
beer
never
had
an
imperial
pils
wasnt
sure
really
what
to
expect
having
said
that
it
was
kind
of
like
what
i
expected
its
kind
of
like
an
ipa
or
dipa
brewed
with
pilsner
ingredients
isnt
it
anyhoo
firstly
one
of
the
crappiest
heads
ive
seen
in
a
while
some
big
ass
bubbles
in
that
fella
some
upfront
fruity
piney
nutty
even
hop
action
on
the
nose
i
tell
ya
try
this
blind
with
some
ipas
and
id
be
impressed
if
many
people
could
pick
this
as
being
an
imp
pils
as
opposed
to
an
ipa
the
piney
hop
flavours
on
the
palate
just
reinforce
this
pretty
low
carbonation
too
for
something
of
the
pilsner
family
still
an
enjoyable
beer
but
like
most
rogue
and
other
usa
beers
here
barely
worth
the
price
d
i
am
not
sure
how
old
this
is
but
i
am
glad
i
did
not
pay
the
full
price
for
this
one
it
just
does
not
work
for
me
there
is
some
citrus
hop
bitterness
but
it
just
feel
tastes
thin
i
am
not
a
fan
but
it
does
somewhat
resemble
the
style
here
there
drinkability
is
very
much
so
overall
its
a
very
well
brewed
beer
fabulous
actually
served
in
an
imp
pint
glass
straw
yellow
a
lil
less
than
golden
color
with
a
frothy
head
strong
scents
of
cut
grass
and
lemon
flavor
profile
has
hints
of
orange
hops
and
forward
straw
malts
slick
almost
oil
feel
in
the
mouth
very
drinkable
alcohol
is
well
hidden
slainte
no
for
real
slainte
nice
beer
probably
awesome
with
sushi
and
spicy
food
im
thinking
mexican
or
thai
good
flavor
overall
and
a
unique
presence
but
not
worth
the
pricetag
wondering
if
i
just
had
a
bottle
that
was
on
the
shelf
too
long
should
have
gotten
it
when
it
was
still
fresh
regardless
its
mellowed
and
is
still
quite
drinkable
at
this
stage
alcohol
has
faded
away
a
bit
as
well
poured
in
pils
glass
for
a
sparkling
ghost
with
great
carbonation
and
a
good
head
that
sticks
around
on
top
of
a
strong
pils
malt
smell
with
a
touch
of
sweetness
and
breadiness
as
well
as
some
citric
hop
crisp
easy
to
drink
pils
malt
very
strong
no
weak
veggie
taste
in
this
beer
as
it
has
a
breadywoodiness
to
it
and
also
some
sugary
sweetness
and
fruit
sweetness
like
grape
and
some
citric
hops
and
finishes
slightly
dry
a
happening
and
easy
to
drink
pils
that
goes
down
great
d
a
little
more
hoppy
than
i
would
expect
for
a
pilsner
being
that
it
is
imperial
why
not
subtleties
of
a
typical
pilsner
are
appreciable
but
big
bold
malt
body
is
intact
worth
looking
for
and
trying
notes
very
pleased
with
this
rogue
beer
that
i
was
able
to
enjoy
on
tap
at
ballantines
a
nice
ba
place
overall
this
beer
was
quite
refreshing
and
seemed
to
a
relative
imperial
pilsner
novice
to
represent
the
style
quite
well
recommended
as
are
most
beers
of
this
type
the
rogue
morimoto
is
not
a
sessional
quaff
but
a
big
bodied
brew
that
demands
respect
patience
and
as
always
the
proper
glassware
rogue
does
have
its
detractors
however
i
am
not
one
imperial
for
sure
pilsner
ok
worth
the
experience
you
bet
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
sweet
and
chewy
good
body
on
this
pilsner
some
warming
alcohol
at
times
i
dont
drink
too
many
pilsners
but
i
find
this
one
quite
drinkable
and
will
definitely
enjoy
finishing
the
bottle
d
like
a
lot
of
people
i
think
its
bullshit
that
rogue
charges
you
more
for
the
packaging
than
for
the
beer
still
this
was
interesting
enough
with
flavors
im
not
used
to
from
pilsners
overall
a
great
brew
from
rogue
they
are
hit
or
miss
with
me
their
cost
are
outrageous
i
dont
mind
paying
for
the
beer
but
im
not
into
paying
for
the
container
it
comes
in
glad
this
was
a
gift
i
liked
it
and
would
love
to
see
it
on
tap
in
my
neighborhood
well
done
to
the
chef
and
brewer
i
am
so
impressed
with
this
bottle
so
impressed
its
taken
me
a
few
months
to
crack
it
and
ive
been
looking
forward
to
it
as
i
do
love
this
styleit
pours
a
semi
cloudy

mouthfeel
starts
off
quite
heavy
and
finishes
with
a
medium
feel
with
really
nice
tastes
of
pineypineygrape
bubblegum
hops
and
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
for
a
beer
of
this
abva
very
nice
beer
in
my
eyes
and
would
drink
it
all
night
if
only
it
didnt
cost
42australian
for
one
bottle
but
to
be
honest
ill
still
prob
buy
another
one
to
put
away
in
my
collectiononce
again
rogue
or
should
i
say
morimoto
has
proven
what
a
beer
should
be
for
the
style
it
is
representing
rbsg09
on
tap
at
the
rogue
publick
house
in
sf
lightly
hazy
straw
color
with
a
frothy
white

very
spicy

lots
of

malt
flavor
dough
fresh
bread
noble
hops
reduced
to
an
afterthought
dry
finish
with
a
light
astringency
a
soso
amped
up
version
of
a
czech
pils
the
alcohol
obviously
not
too
well
integrated
but
drinkable
i
suppose
once
ones
palate
succumbs
like
when
youre
sipping
whiskey
or
the
like
morimoto
imperial
pilsner
is
the
second
highlyrated
big
rogue
product
to
come
off
like
a
booze
bomb
to
me
while
it
was
somewhat
easy
to
procure
another
bomber
of
their
yellow
snow
ipa
for
another
try
i
dont
know
that
i
want
to
drop
another
22
bucks
for
another
go
around
at
this
one
last
of
the
available
imperial
series
from
rouge
that
i
havent
tried
pours
a
hazy
golden
hue
with
some
foam
that
sticks
around
aroma
is
very
floral
with
hops
and
malt
a
strong
sweet
yeast
smell
quite
nose
tingling
the
aroma
alone
lets
you
know
this
is
a
step
up
from
the
rest
the
sip
starts
off
pretty
mellow
compared
to
the
aroma
but
then
it
hits
the
back
of
your
tongue
strong
malts
a
hint
of
roasted
and
then
the
hops
kick
in
just
enough
citrus
to
really
enjoy
it
it
seems
a
bit
more
mellow
than
the
sam
adams
version
but
this
one
has
more
of
a
mouth
feel
i
believe
this
one
of
those
styles
you
dont
see
very
often
very
well
done
but
not
too
complex
very
good
but
a
bit
pricey
drinkability
a
surprisingly
competent
beer
a
doubleimperial
pilsner
at
8
8
is
nothing
to
sneeze
at
but
honestly
could
be
a
lot
higher
this
one
manages
to
be
intense
and
flavorful
without
coming
across
as
too
boozey
but
be
careful
it
is
ever
so
slightly
re
the
flavors
and
intensity
theyre
nice
wellbalanced
and
wellcrafted
though
its
not
my
favorite
dip
id
recommend
this
one
to
anyone
whos
a
fan
of
the
style
drinkability
the
heavy
nature
of
these
imperialized
doublefied
pilsners
totally
negate
the
simple
refreshing
qualities
of
a
good
pils
starts
engaging
but
for
me
it
soon
grew
tiresome
and
turned
into
the
beerequivalent
of
helping
someone
move
overall
i
felt
like
it
was
over
priced
tasted
good
but
lasting
hops
after
taste
wasnt
as
enjoyable
d
highly
drinkable
very
nice
mix
all
around
different
from
other
imperial
pilsners
but
one
i
want
to
have
again
enjoyed
1
of
these
during
the
1st
quarter
of
the
super
bowl
let
me
tell
you
it
didnt
suck
pours
out
of
the
ceramic
bottle
with
a
clean
white
head
and
golden
crisp
body
a
little
subdued
on
the
front
of
the
palate
then
it
kicks
in
toasted
malt
flavor
underlying
bite
followed
seamlessly
by
a
crisp
dryness
that
zips
through
your
mouth
as
you
swallow
leaving
you
savoring
the
finish
and
wondering
when
youll
decide
to
partake
again
dude
this
is
a
good
thing
cheers
d
one
of
the
best
rogue
beers
ive
had
im
certainly
impressed
with
it
strong
flavours
not
overdone
or
overhopped
a
classic
flavour
of
this
style
though
the
style
is
anything
but
classic
the
beer
overall
while
expensive
is
well
worth
it
the
citrus
fruits
come
through
beautifully
and
the
smooth
creamy
mouthfeel
leaves
you
refreshed
and
wanting
more
more
more
the
apple
flavor
dominates
some
but
based
on
price
can
get
a
sams
4
pack
for
cheaper
and
both
are
very
good
and
i
may
even
say
the
sams
impy
is
a
bit
of
a
step
up
in
hop
flavor
poured
into
a
10
oz
goblet
bright
yellow
in
color
with
white
suds
surrounding
the
air
exposed
beer
big
hit
of
lemons
is
the
main
attraction
very
clean
in
the
light
with
some
moderate
alcohol
present
in
the
nostrils
gulp
hops
with
a
combination
of
the
pilsner
bitterness
makes
for
a
sweet
blend
that
surprises
the
palate
very
refreshing
given
the
abv
a
nice
treat
of
a
beer
indeed
recommended
to
the
all
imperial
fans
around
the
globe
is
it
worth
the
price
tag
certainly
not
at
15
99
for
25
36
oz
or
750ml
it
is
not
a
beer
i
could
make
a
habit
of
drinking
daily
d
i
could
do
too
much
with
this
high
abv
success
i
finally
found
this
one
in
san
diego
at
servall
and
for
only
15
pours
like
a
glass
of
regular
grapefruit
juice
murky
orangeyellow
with
a
frothy
white
head
delicious
aroma
of
saaz
hops
cornbread
sugar
grass
and
cereal
smooth
sweet
taste
with
more
hops
and
a
decadent
bavarian
malt
back
a
hint
of
crystal
malt
velvet
smooth
mouthfeel
an
incredible
allaround
beer
since
its
a
pilsner
you
cant
tell
the
alcohol
presence
at
all
very
drinkable
d
a
good
beer
indeed
would
i
buy
it
again
probably
not
32aus
is
worth
it
to
try
once
but
not
for
repeat
purchase
pours
a
golden
color
body
somewhat
cloudy
and
bubbly
huge
rocky
frothy
white
head
lasting
a
while
hoppy
bitter
aroma
sweetness
and
some
floralness
some
grain
present
too
soft
mouthfeel
a
little
watery
has
a
bitter
aftertaste
grainy
taste
maybe
wheat
or
something
bitter
letting
this
one
warm
up
a
bit
has
minimal
affect
thirst
quenching
nice
bitter
taste
not
sure
im
supposed
to
include
the
bottle
in
appearance
but
it
is
so
cool
it
has
to
go
somewhere
nice
copper
apricot
color
with
active
head
that
leaves
nice
lacing
and
ive
never
seen
a
pilsner
get
my
attention
like
this
one
smells
of
rose
hips
caramel
and
pepper
i
could
learn
to
like
pilsners
taste
yes
yes
yes
yes
yes
yes
caramel
crisp
hops
a
tad
metallic
but
crisp
finish
im
not
a
big
hophead
but
this
one
is
a
hoppy
beer
for
the
rest
of
us
the
mouthfeel
is
a
touch
sticky
a
little
smooth
and
all
good
drinkability
is
good
but
the
finish
is
a
touch
too
hoppy
for
a
lot
of
these
still
one
of
the
best
pilsners
ive
had
one
of
the
best
hoppy
beers
an
impressive
beer
but
frankly
i
prefer
my
pilsners
to
have
all
the
flavor
without
the
high
alcohol
d
for
8
8abv
this
is
dangerously
drinkable
this
beer
is
a
bit
on
the
pricey
side
but
nothing
to
complain
about
good
beer
commands
a
higher
price
and
you
get
to
keep
the
nice
ceramic
bottle
with
resealing
cap
d
drinkable
the
price
of
this
bottle
is
absolutely
ridiculous
however
rogue
is
a
great
brewery
but
i
am
little
frustrated
with
the
fact
that
all
of
their
beers
are
at
least
a
few
dollars
more
than
others
i
guess
i
am
just
a
sucker
to
have
paid
14
99
for
the
stupid
ceramic
bottle
full
of
just
average
beer
rogue
really
has
got
us
beer
geeks
where
they
want
us
this
poured
a
copper
color
with
a
nice
fat
white
head
and
good
lacing
nose
however
is
just
strong
citrus
and
floral
hops
not
much
else
mouthfeel
is
crisp
an
clean
but
not
remarkable
flavor
shows
a
lot
of
malts
and
is
decently
balanced
with
the
hops
alcohol
shows
in
the
bitter
finish
smells
and
tastes
more
like
an
dipa
than
a
pilsner
the
best
part
of
this
was
the
bottle
poured
from
a
nifty
white
26
oz
ceramic
bottle
into
a
pilsner
glass
looks
light
moderately
bubbly
and
has
a
uneven
off
white
head
that
coalesces
into
bigger
bubbles
that
disappear
and
fades
into
fingers
of
fizz
has
a
light
sweet
and
flowery
scent
with
a
kind
of
caramel
undertone
but
not
very
hoppy
the
hoppy
bite
comes
out
in
the
taste
it
cuts
but
also
has
something
that
reminds
me
of
lavender
then
it
goes
heavy
and
sweet
with
more
hop
and
finally
a
pleasantly
bitter
finish
that
lingers
with
just
a
hint
of
sweetness
feels
light
and
effervescent
in
the
mouth
but
kind
of
coats
its
not
as
crisp
as
id
expect
a
pilsner
to
be
its
very
good
but
not
exceptionally
good
and
pretty
expensive
26
oz
ceramic
flip
top
bottle
i
have
been
anxiously
awaiting
this
one
golden
colored
topped
with
a
thick
foamy
offwhite
head
and
lots
of
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
is
quite
grassy
and
malty
with
only
a
touch
of
hops
and
perhaps
some
hay
notes
as
well
the
flavor
starts
with
some
rich
french
pilsner
malts
then
turns
fruity
hoppy
and
sour
sour
aftertaste
that
sits
on
the
tongue
more
of
a
malt
presence
than
i
expected
better
as
it
warms
definitely
a
good
beer
but
something
was
just
a
tad
off
way
too
expensive
but
i
guess
thats
partly
because
of
the
bottle
crazy
drinkable
for
8
8
if
i
didnt
already
know
what
the
abv
was
i
never
wouldve
guessed
8
we
polished
the
bottle
off
pretty
fast
thanks
ryan
d
drinkable
and
well
brewed
for
style
not
something
ill
miss
but
if
you
like
the
style
its
worth
it
d
tasty
goes
down
dangerously
easily
not
too
filling
strong
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
good
stronger
beer
thats
worth
drinking
for
a
long
time
until
the
abv
catches
up
to
you
excellent
brew
but
i
have
to
put
it
in
context
of
the
price
brilliantly
hoppy
refreshing
bitterness
just
dances
around
the
mouth
but
for
16
theres
a
bit
more
on
the
market
just
as
good
for
significantly
less
maybe
if
rogue
released
this
in
one
of
their
regular
glass
bottles
rather
than
the
fancy
ceramic
one
id
consider
it
i
found
it
difficult
to
finish
in
one
sitting
though
so
perhaps
the
resealable
bottle
wasnt
such
a
bad
thing
that
said
i
was
trying
it
on
its
own
without
food
with
a
good
meal
in
front
of
me
im
sure
the
whole
thing
would
have
disappeared
funny
thing
is
having
eaten
morimotos
food
a
number
of
times
i
dont
see
it
pairing
with
his
cuisine
this
is
not
a
subtle
beer
would
probably
go
great
with
sweeter
more
forcefully
flavored
asian
fare
vietnamese
or
chinese
ordered
a
bomber
of
this
and
was
very
impressed
overall
generally
prefer
more
flavor
than
a
pilsner
but
this
is
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
appearance
is
just
a
tad
lighter
than
a
typical
pale
ale
and
definitely
darker
than
a
regular
pilsner
about
what
i
expected
head
doesnt
show
lacing
like
a
heavier
beer
but
impressive
again
given
the
style
smell
is
excellent
alcohol
is
noticeable
but
not
overbearing
tastes
very
good
and
is
very
drinkable
especially
given
9
abv
i
could
pretty
easily
drink
2
of
the
bombers
or
probably
3
pours
if
on
draft
deceptively
high
abv
overall
a
very
good
beer
and
for
someone
who
cant
get
enough
hops
a
nice
change
of
pace
eric
rogue
deserves
serious
credit
for
this
one
it
would
be
nice
to
see
this
in
cans
or
12
oz
bottles
i
had
a
more
fresh
one
on
tap
and
the
flavouring
was
about
the
same
just
more
bitterness
at
the
end
d
one
of
the
best
imperial
pilsners
i
have
had
the
pleasure
of
tasting
big
thanks
to
my
mom
for
this
gift
for
my
35th
i
remember
having
a
bottle
of
this
5
years
ago
and
the
quality
of
this
imperial
pils
has
not
diminished
for
me
to
enjoy
the
750ml
bottle
at
morimotos
philadelphia
location
was
so
enjoyable
and
the
way
the
beer
complimented
the
omakase
was
nice
considering
the
contrast
of
the
citrus
and
soy
flavors
w
cilantro
in
the
yellowtail
sashimia
and
baby
snapper
dishes
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
the
8
8
lager
and
the
booziness
was
not
apparent
at
all
until
we
walked
out
into
the
near
90
degree
street
temperature
and
felt
the
moisture
leave
my
body
d
hilariously
drinkable
this
ones
going
down
very
easy
very
nice
beer
not
a
great
value
though
at
15
bucks
i
doubt
ill
buy
another
one
they
should
make
this
one
of
their
permanent
bomber
lineups
though
id
happily
pay
5
for
it
the
head
withered
but
lacing
maintained
its
integrity
down
to
the
last
drop
which
i
was
sorry
to
see
would
strongly
reccomend
havent
repuchased
yet
a
little
pricy
second
pour
into
a
pilsner
glass
proved
much
more
enjoyable
bad
smell
was
replaced
by
a
sweeter
almost
ale
like
yeast
aroma
sweeter
fruits
pale
ale
malts
crisp
and
clean
convinced
the
first
glass
wasnt
clean
dont
know
what
else
to
say
i
like
it
more
than
envy
and
definitely
more
than
sa
impy
pilsner
i
probably
wont
buy
it
again
because
of
the
price
unless
i
am
trying
to
do
a
really
big
pilsner
notes
excellent
stuff
and
unlike
many
beers
labeled
as
an
imperial
pilsener
this
actually
tastes
like
a
pils
im
talking
to
you
sam
adams
this
is
an
incredible
imperial
pilsner
from
rogue
i
could
drink
these
all
night
well
done
and
am
glad
to
have
waited
its
interesting
to
see
so
many
fusion
styles
on
the
shelves
these
days
i
bought
this
beer
mainly
to
see
whether
it
could
live
up
to
the
title
of
imperial
pilsner
all
in
all
im
certainly
impressed
and
feel
like
the
style
designation
is
apt
that
said
the
aroma
was
a
bit
too
fruity
and
hoppy
as
for
bitterness
and
character
i
do
look
for
a
certain
spicy
hop
character
in
a
pilsner
but
the
aftertaste
borders
on
excessive
other
than
that
the
body
and
mouthfeel
are
quite
pilsneresque
for
an
8
8
brew
the
appeareance
is
clear
but
do
i
detect
a
slight
hint
of
chillhaze
there
is
a
bit
of
a
sweet
malt
quality
somewhere
in
the
middle
of
a
taste
but
much
less
than
i
expected
from
something
this
strong
it
must
have
taken
quite
a
bit
of
care
in
the
fermentation
of
such
a
beverage
do
take
note
its
easy
to
think
your
drinking
a
light
lager
here
take
your
time
this
is
a
great
imperial
pilsner
rogue
and
morimoto
really
know
their
stuff
im
just
sorry
i
dont
have
some
sushi
teriyaki
or
udon
to
go
with
it
this
was
a
strange
pour
the
first
half
of
the
bottle
was
much
brighter
than
the
second
half
and
had
more
head
the
second
half
poured
a
hazy
gold
with
no
head
but
both
halves
tasted
basically
the
same
it
smelled
of
lemony
yeast
and
some
malt
it
tasted
very
strongly
of
citrus
hops
with
a
dominate
grapefruit
flavor
it
was
slightly
thick
with
minimal
carbonation
and
had
a
long
bitter
aftertaste
overall
it
was
a
decent
but
unbalanced
beer
near
fullbodied
initial
harshness
eases
at
it
progresses
but
it
still
is
a
slow
sipper
interesting
but
there
are
examples
of
style
i
would
prefer
too
pricey
to
have
as
any
kond
of
regular
or
rotating
dont
know
if
it
was
worth
the
price
though
the
bottle
is
cool
moderatemedium
mouthfeel
soft
yet
substantial
pretty
good
for
a
double
pils
but
still
not
that
drinkable
excellent
drinkability
this
one
went
down
nice
and
smooth
and
i
could
have
easily
polished
off
a
second
bottle
definitely
recommended
drinkability
is
very
good
this
is
a
style
which
is
difficult
to
get
right
and
this
beer
is
spot
on
lets
be
honest
here
this
is
a
real
imperial
pilsner
sam
adam
hallertau
in
contrast
is
an

ipa
made
with

mittelfrueh

so
if
the
scoring
was

morimoto
would
win
hands
down
but
because
im
a

iipa
addict
i
score
hallertau
higher
at
the
end
of
the
day
i
highly
recommend

my
folks
bought
me
back
a
bottle
of
the
morimoto
imperial
pilsner
from
a
recent
trip
they
took
im
not
much
of
a
pilsman
this
is
a
crisp
and
clean
yet
flavorful
beer
easy
to
drink
this
and
not
notice
the
high

very
enjoyable
beer
the
appearance
is
a
slightly
hazy
yellow
gold
beer
with
plenty
of
carbonation
very
big
hit
of
hops
in
the
nose
and
some
malt
although
it
is
difficult
to
find
much
of
anything
past
the
hops
im
not
really
sure
which
hop
variety
is
dominating
the
aroma
but
it
seems
spicy
and
german
which
is
kinda
refreshing
compared
to
all
the
american
hops
ive
been
exposed
to
recently
the
taste
is
pretty
smooth
and
a
little
fruity
with
a
mega
bitter
backbone
the
burn
of
the
hops
lingers
on
my
tongue
for
a
good
while
loads
of
body
surprisingly
drinkable
for
something
so
potent

i

the

isnt

it
really

a

an

very

thats
all
you
need
to

nothing
like

from

its
actually
more
along

of

just
a

surely
i
could
drink
bottles
of
this
stuff
its
so
easy
anyway
on
looking
at
the
other
reviews
i
suspect
the
beer
has
been
altered
somewhat
in
the
last
few
years
mine
was
a
2012
bottle
the
beer
was
very
simple
indeed
but
i
enjoyed
it

nice

a
cloudy

nice

aroma
is
very
earthy
with
wet
sock
hop
floral

grassy
notes
the
taste
is
fairly
boozy
and
bitter
overall
the
grass
and
floral
notes
are
very
overwhelming
at
first
and
take
time
getting
used
too
this
may
have
something
to
do
with
the
age
of
this
one
light
to
medium
bodied
and
moderate
to
high
carbonation
this
one
is
both
interesting
and
a
little
tough
to
drink
it
is
certainly
unique
this
one
may
be
very
different
as
it
is
an
older
keg
a
decent
beer
for
sure
though
not
a
lot
of
character
and
overly
simplistic
for
my
tastes
you
can
do
a
lot
worse
but
nothing
that
really
sticks
out
for
me
mdafter
the
initial
taste
there
is
a
slight
sweetness
that
fades
from
the
mouth
rather
quickly
decent
drinker
but
there
better
options
drinkability
is
good
there
are
no
unpleasant
aftertastes
the
high

is

not
a
beer
i
would
typically
choose
but
im
glad
i
had
the
opportunity
to
try
it
it
went
down
very
well
but
i
wont
be
buying
any
more
of
this
one
for

d
very
good
goes

and

good
had
no

this
was
a
very
nice
option
on
a
beautiful
day
on
the
oregon

it
pours
a
rather
typical
clear

but
gets
a
point
for
having
a
rather
thick
fluffy

aroma
is
strong
and
malty
with
a
firm
fruity
overtone
mainly
apple

flavor
is
a

bland
and
has
an
unpleasing
metallic
taste
to
it
but
is
still
palatable
texture
is
edgy
and
just
a
little
tingly
nothing
to
write
home
about
this
is
the
only
rogue
beer
i
have
ever
tried
that
disappointed
but
i
will
finish
this
bottle
had
this
on
tap
at
the
stable
nice
golden
color
with
a
fair
amount
of
head
this
really
had
a
yeasty
and
grainy
smell
to
it
yet
the
taste
was
crisp
very
breadlike
nice
body
and
almost
no
aftertaste
which
is
surprising
for
a

herbs
accompanied
by
orange

malts
are
well
integrated
pushing
the
taste
into
a
sweeter
direction
the
malt
sweetness
then
gets
damped
by
a
wheaty
dry
finish
in
which
the
metallic
carbonation
shines
the
dry
finish
remains
interesting
due
to
tropical

really

booze
overall
this
is
a
exactly
what
an
imperial
pilsner
is
expected
to
taste
like
o
above

pilsner
not
as
good
as

really
nice
if
youre
looking

somewhat
boozy
pilsner

for

and
a

a

hues
and
an
inch
or
two
of
lazy
white
head
the

is

its

with
an

of

in
there

sweet
through
with
some

booze
on

end
its
a
little
thinner
than
i
want
it
to
be
but
the
flavors
work
really
well
its
got
an
almost
pilsner
malt
flavor
to
it
dry
and
european
but
it
also
has
some
caramel
sweetness
its
not
complex
but
it
isnt
simple
either
sort
of
a
hard
beer
to
put
into
context
fine
carbonation
above
a
medium
body
the
finish
is
spirited
and
i
get
a
touch
of
brown
sugar
as
it
goes
out
overall
a
beer
worth
the
14
bucks
i
paid
for
it
this
time
but
probably
not
one
ill
buy
again

with

for

its

overall
having
had
my
share
of
disappointment
with
this
style
i
was
expecting
a
beer
that
was
boozy
and
sweet
with
a
clash
from
the
noble
hops
this
was
more
like
a
dipa
and
but
for
the
mouthfeel
i
might
never
have
guessed
it
was
a
lager
no
twang
and
no
booze
just
really
well
done
overall
way
more
hop
forward
than
anticipated
has
the
bitterness
of
an
ipa
alcohol
is
a
bit
overpowering
the
hop
character
is
varied
but
just
not
very
tasty
o
im
afraid
ive
let
this
one
sit
in
the
fridge
too
long
i
remember
this
having
much
more
of
a
hop
presence
when
fresh
would
love
to
get
this
fresh
again
picked
this
up
at
my
favorite
beer
store
in
belgium
dranken

with

with
hints

lemon
peel
bread
and
a
bit
of
caramel
first
sip
really
caught
me
off
guard
wasnt
expecting
such
a
bold
flavorful
beer
the
taste
is
loaded
with
perfumey
citrusy
bitter
fresh
hops
along
with
hints
of
pine
and
tangerines
all
nicely
balanced
out
with
a
solid
caramel
malt
backbone
the
mouthfeel
is
perfectly
carbonated
and
subtly
oily
with
a
crisp
dry
bitter
finish
hugely
drinkable
im
kicking
myself
for
only
getting
one
of
these
im
hoping
theres
some
left
when
i
go
on
my
next
beer
run
another
winner
from
mikkeller
od
i
quite
liked
this
closer
to
a
dipa
but
it
was
nice
smooth
drinkable
and
flavourful
wow
drink
this
at
your
own
risk
mere
lesser
mortals
would
not
make
it
past
the
first
sip
i
on
the
other
hand
have
conquered
this
ale
like
many
others
go
forth
and
be
brave
young
padawan
the
taste
was
very
hoppy
and
citrusy
as
well
it
was
very
dry
a
very
strange
lager
indeed
i
bought
it
knowing
it
was
a
lager
there
was
really
very
little
information
on
the
bottle
but
since
it
was
a
lager
i
thought
i
had
some
idea
of
what
to
expect
this
is
not
it
they
should
really
print
something
on
the
bottle
to
give
an
indication
as
to
its
contents
this
was
really
terrible
mostly
because
i
dont
like
this
style
of
beer
but
since
i
didnt
receive
any
indication
of
the
style
i
feel
compelled
to
rate
it
as
beer
in
general
it
was
very
bitter
very
citrus
i
didnt
like
it
one
bit
if
you
like
bitter
citrusy
beer
get
it
decent
but
nothing
more
than
a
dry
crisp
boozy
ipa
for
my
money
overall
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
enjoyed
in
recent
memory
perfect
for
all
seasons
and
absolutely
delicious
and
satisfying
o
a
nice
fruity
crisp
brew
very
drinkable
i
wish
i
could
get
my
hands
on
a
few
more
o
enjoyable
and
i
imagine
this
beer
would
pair
very
well
with
a
hearty
winter
soup
or
oven
roasted
root
vegetables
i
might
have
enjoyed
just
a
little
more
hoppiness
and
bitterness
in
this
beer
o
this
beer
has
some
refreshing
properties
and
hides
its
alcohol
very
well
it
has
a
rather
good
balance
between
the
malts
and
hops
o
i
find
this
to
be
a
near
outstanding
strong
lager
that
capably
straddles
the
line
between
a
boutique
malt
liquor
and
an
american
imperial
pilsner
very
drinkable
compared
to
other
beers
of
this
type
this
lager
is
bound
to
impress
great
imperial
lager
with
a
nice
strong
aroma
and
a
spike
of
hop
flavor
ending
very
dry
and
mildly
bitter
interesting
take
on
this
new
style
o
meh
had
better
sorry
to
say
this
was
far
better
than
i
was
expecting
o
a
fruity
boozy
delight
poured
from
a
750
ml
bottle
into
a
pilsner
glass
pours
a
nice
hazy
light
gold
color
with
a
massive
white
head
the
smells
are
pretty
good
crisp
floral
citrus
feel
is
medium
with
decent
carbonation
the
taste
is
as
it
smells
crisp
nice
hop
bite
at
the
end
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
pilsner
with
awesome
hop
presence
enjoyed
big
time
pours
with
a
hazy
golden
color
and
a
big
ass
head
aromas
range
from
boozy
to
hoppygrassy
this
beer
is
awesome
and
drinks
like
a
hopinfused
liquor
with
hops
punching
through
in
bitterness
flavor
and
aroma
this
beer
is
delicious
so
dont
knock
it
because
of
categorization
label
or
otherwise
its
an
awesome
beer
light
amber
with
a
nice
cap
of
white
hanging
over
the
top
of
the
glass
nice
rich
looking
head
of
foam
on
the
top
of
the
glass
here
now
as
well
nicely
done
i
have
to
say
aroma
immediately
is
a
bit
boozy
with
hints
of
grass
touches
of
hops
and
a
light
fruit
note
that
seems
to
pick
up
the
warmer
it
gets
interesting
flavor
profile
as
well
here
not
at
all
what
i
was
expecting
hints
of
citrus
a
touch
of
herbal
floral
notes
and
a
really
nice
and
well
laid
out
malty
background
quite
nicely
done
really
a
nice
take
on
this
style
i
was
pleased
with
the
american
hops
introduced
and
yet
it
doesnt
take
away
from
the
malts
o
a
cracking
beer
and
no
sign
of
the
8
abv
the
balance
in
this
beer
is
to
be
applauded
i
like
this
beer
but
i
dont
love
it
its
possible
that
i
may
really
grow
to
appreciate
this
even
more
than
i
do
right
now
and
i
am
more
than
happy
to
revisit
this
in
the
future
an
interesting
brew
for
sure
bit
of
a
mixed
bag
drinks
pretty
well
for
an
8
pilsener
but
i
cant
warm
to
flavours
and
sensations
that
remind
me
of
going
to
the
dentist
a
bit
of
an
odd
beer
but
plenty
to
like
and
keep
you
drinking
o
this
is
a
good
bear
but
not
the
best
example
of
the
style
i
have
had
its
a
bit
of
a
shame
its
a
nice
pilsener
that
is
somewhat
ruined
by
ramping
up
the
abv
could
have
been
better
dr
it
drinks
very
well
for
the
relatively
high
abv
but
doesnt
deliver
promising
or
inspired
flavours
the
middle
sags
in
its
blandness
i
was
very
disappointed
as
a
mikkeller
fanatic
but
in
fairness
mikkeller
always
does
better
at
darker
stronger
beers
than
this
moreover
its
wildly
overpriced
a
bit
too
much
booze
and
when
combined
with
the
sharp
unchecked
bitterness
it
seems
a
bit
harsh
o
really
like
this
one
more
than
i
anticipated
it
had
some
barley
wine
characteristics
to
it
that
made
it
really
rather
nice
and
enjoyable
worth
trying
if
you
can
get
your
hands
on
it
overall
this
was
a
very
good
and
interesting
beer
obviously
you
would
expect
a
pils
to
be
very
bitter
and
aromatic
but
the
imperial
variety
adds
a
strong
feel
of
sweet
maltiness
and
sweet
ethanol
to
it
i
really
like
this
more
than
i
should
considering
its
abv
a
good
flavorful
beer
nice
hoppy
flavor
opinion
i
am
having
a
hard
time
drinking
this
beer
and
i
will
probably
go
down
in
the
ranks
as
the
lowest
score
of
the
70
reviews
at
this
time
the
beer
itself
will
almost
positively
be
going
down
in
the
ranks
of
my
drainpipe
this
beer
is
brutal
maybe
it
is
because
the
cork
leaked
and
the
oxidation
killed
it
i
am
surprised
as
some
of
the
flavors
and
such
are
simply
not
appropriate
for
a
pilsner
but
a
lot
of
them
in
this
beer
are
downright
unpleasant
for
me
i
have
been
underwhelmed
with
mikkeller
products
overall
and
after
this
experience
they
may
have
completely
pushed
me
away
i
dont
know
why
i
keep
paying
money
for
this
abuse
huge
thanks
to
grant
for
sending
me
this
cool
beer
in
a
recent
trade
poured
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
murky
looking
golden
brown
color
with
about
an
inch
of
head
with
good
sticky
lace
the
body
looks
a
little
unapealing
but
its
not
bad
seems
like
if
i
drank
this
sooner
there
would
be
more
of
aaa
hop
presence
but
still
a
pretty
good
aroma
candied
orange
with
sweet
toffee
the
flavor
is
just
like
the
aroma
candied
orange
with
a
bit
of
toffee
big
malt
body
on
this
i
feel
like
im
not
reviewing
this
in
its
prime
the
feel
is
kind
of
sticky
with
good
carbonation
still
an
enjoyable
beer
even
though
i
think
its
past
its
prime
if
you
got
any
of
these
drink
up
i
dont
think
there
is
any
point
in
holding
on
to
these
pours
a
beautiful
golden
brown
with
a
full
three
fingers
of
head
the
slowly
dissipates
and
leaves
a
beautiful
cap
nose
offers
bitter
citrus
floral
tones
and
what
i
can
only
describe
as
a
fresh
boiling
wort
in
the
mouth
its
reminiscent
of
a
mild
ipa
with
nice
citrus
pine
and
floral
notes
extremely
drinkable
and
refreshing
with
the
alcohol
barely
noticeable
finishes
with
nice
grain
and
a
smooth
not
sweet
malt
taste
one
of
my
new
favorites
this
is
flavorful
and
silky
smooth
if
you
love

you
will
love

hops
are
a

with

malt
isnt
holding
back
either
with
rustic
bread
and
dried
grass
on
the
palate
warming
alcohol
and
chalky
yeast
in
the
bitter
semidry
finish
raw
and
in
your
facethe
punk
of
pilsners
here
an
interesting
choice
that
has
a
promising
early
taste
and
drinkable
dryness
in
the
end
just
a
bit
soulless
in
between
d
it
drank
very
well
and
was
quite
tasty
considering
the
lack
of
ingedients
going
into
this
beer
im
glad
i
had
the
opportunity
to
try
this
brew
t
yummy
and
unique
i
was
sipping
on
this
from
the
balcony
of
an
oceanfront
condo
during
a
storm
nursing
a
fresh
jellyfish
sting
all
was
well
with
the
world
d
easy
to
drink
could
have
drank
the
whole
bottle
instead
of
splitting
it
however
i
had
it
on
draft
a
few
months
before
and
it
was
much
better
more
hoppier
and
grassy
if
this
beer
was
marketed
as
an
ipa
or
a
hopped
ale
it
would
have
received
much
higher
marks
this
beer
is
interesting
hybrid
but
not
quite
there
yet
you
can
skip
over
this
one
killer
beer
its
pretty
much
the
way
they
say
in
the
commercial
description
poured
with
a
nice
white
head
and
plenty
of
lace
color
is
a
hazy
amber
aroma
is
very
aromatically
spicey
yeast
malt
and
hoppy
flavor
is
clean
like
aroma
and
bigger
body
is
appropriately
full
and
well
carbonated
finish
is
like
flavor
but
then
tapers
to
quite
bitter
almost
a
little
too
bitter
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
large
white
head
the
aroma
is
pilsner
malt
with
a
mix
of
hop
flavors
including
grass
pine
and
citrus
the
flavor
is
orange
citrus
hops
with
some
light
pine
notes
and
a
strong
backbone
of
pilsner
malt
there
are
also
a
lot
of
grassy
hops
in
the
flavor
low
bitterness
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
d
very
drinkable
for
such
a
strong
beer
would
love
to
have
a
chance
to
try
this
on
draft
the
draft
bear
has
slightly
translucent
reddish
copper
color
that
shines
it
has
the
pilsner
smell
the
fresh
yeasty
whiff
of
pils
malts
but
nothing
of
your
danish
grandpas
pilsner
in
color
or
flavor
at
8
abv
its
a
slow
sipping
beer
thats
warmly
hopped
and
tastes
like
light
brown
sugar
or
that
cotton
candy
flavor
but
without
being
too
sweet
all
this
is
lovingly
wellbalanced
to
make
a
sexy
modern
beer
i
was
unable
to
find
any
clues
about
why
the
mikkeller
draft
bear
is
called
a
bear
is
it
related
to
the
mythical
boontville
creature
from
anderson
valley
the
beer
but
come
to
think
of
it
the
draft
bear
is
sort
of
grizzly
bearcolored
another
fine
brew
from
mikkeller
im
astonished
i
gotta
go
back
to
copenhagen
thank
you
slainte
this
is
a
beer
of
great
pedigree
and
drunk
at
its
peak
would
get
a
much
higher
score
this
bottle
is
simply
a
little
past
prime
drinking
the
most
fun
thing
about
the
draft
bear
is
the
lemon
essence
that
goes
from
light
on
the
aroma
to
strong
on
the
palate
and
even
comes
through
with
the
oily
texture
d
wish
i
got
distribution
of
this
i
think
ill
trade
for
a
few
more
really
a
treat
just
what
i
needed
i
had
a
great
time
with
this
beer
taste
is
bitter
with
a
nice
balanced
hop
taste
and
bitterness
the
bottom
fermenting
yeast
adds
a
whole
new
light
on
a
big
hoppy
beer
the
yeast
adds
a
light
maltiness
some
light
sulfur
and
crisp
taste
the
hops
are
us
hops
but
i
also
get
some
european
herbal
and
light
grassy
tastes
the
balance
of
this
beer
is
just
right
the
hops
are
not
bold
its
mouthfeel
corresponds
nicely
with
the
bitterness
a
great
drinking
beer
the
nose
is
full
of
pine
but
not
as
big
as
the
danish
dream
thanks
to
a
noticeable
caramel
sweetness
a
touch
of
alcohol
is
noticeable
as
well
the
palate
opens
a
mix
of
bitterness
and
sweetness
pretty
solid
pine
again
is
the
big
flavor
but
the
grainy
and
caramel
sweetness
rein
it
in
a
bit
mildly
sweet
on
the
finish
with
a
blend
of
resiny
hop
and
palatecoating
sweetness
this
medium
bodied
beer
has
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
decent
stuff
but
i
found
the
danish
dream
to
be
quite
superior
the
draft
pours
a
rich
gold
color
with
good
head
retention
and
lots
of
sticky
lacing
the
nose
is
similar
to
the
danish
dream
but
is
not
as
candyish
or
sweet
still
there
is
some
serious
bitterness
on
the
nose
which
is
replicate
on
the
palate
however
this
beer
is
a
bit
more
complex
with
some
honey
pepper
and
dry
ginger
ale
like
the
danish
dream
the
finish
is
surprising
bitter
albeit
not
quite
as
dry
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
pretty
long
finish
alcohol
is
pretty
well
disguised
thought
the
beer
seems
on
the
boozy
side
after
the
danish
dream
nevertheless
this
is
yet
another
very
fine
beer
from
mikkeller
d
this
does
not
resemble
a
pilsener
very
nice
better
on
draught
than
in
the
bottle
smoother
with
less
apparent
alcohol
75cl
bottle
pours
clear
gold
with
a
small
fluffy
white
head
that
leaves
decent
lacing
smells
quite
sweet
with
fairly
strong
hop
character
that
lends
some
grapefruit
and
grass
notes
the
sweetness
carries
over
to
the
taste
again
with
some
grapefruit
notes
strong
hop
bitterness
slight
soapiness
not
from
soap
im
sure
warming
finishslightly
boozy
slick
medium
body
too
big
for
its
own
good
like
most
mikkeller
beers
so
im
not
a
pilsner
person
its
funny
because
i
think
pilsner
glasses
are
really
nice
but
usually
i
am
more
impressed
with
the
glass
than
its
contents
the
other
thing
about
pilsners
is
that
in
comparison
with
other
beers
theres
not
a
lot
of
room
for
show
its
the
blonde
woman
of
beer
cant
really
get
much
out
of
her
but
mikkeller
can
ive
yet
to
be
disappointed
with
his
brews
while
his
methods
are
unorthodox
his
brews
are
delicious
and
this
imperial
pilsner
is
no
different
the
head
was
really
fluffy
and
that
means
that
even
on
our
tall
pilsner
glasses
you
get
more
lace
than
an
80s
wedding
the
head
thins
out
but
you
keep
it
most
of
the
way
down
the
scent
was
something
like
green
apples
tart
crisp
and
fresh
like
you
could
bite
into
it
like
it
would
make
your
breath
fresh
the
color
is
just
a
tad
dark
for
a
pilsner
but
it
is
imperial
the
taste
has
a
very
consistent
hop
flavor
from
sip
to
aftertaste
with
the
apple
notes
twisting
around
it
like
snakes
around
a
caduceus
however
it
is
still
a
pilsner
but
if
you
have
to
drink
a
pilsner
it
should
be
this
one
pours
a
very
nice
golden
orangeyellow
color
nice
carbonation
nice
onefinger
creamy
offwhite
head
with
lots
of
nice
sticky
lacing
to
follow
the
nose
is
malty
with
some
yeast
and
slight
hop
note
slight
citrus
the
taste
is
malty
yeastyhoppy
very
slight
citrus
note
medium
body
drinkable
a
very
nice
brew
not
as
hot
as
other
double
pilsners
imperial
pilsners
are
always
an
adventure
this
one
is
no
different
worth
trying
but
very
pricey
at
14
99
drinkability
this
is
a
sessionable
imperial
pils
if
i
have
ever
had
one
not
100
true
to
style
really
feels
like
a
strong
english
ipa
still
quite
drinkable
and
quite
tasty
whatever
it
may
be
good
job
overall
an
interesting
brew
but
i
think
i
could
have
done
with
a
lighter
malt
profile
and
less
fruitiness
but
thats
just
me
worth
a
look
overall
a
superb
brew
and
one
that
i
wish
i
could
get
my
hands
on
more
easily
highly
recommended
a
bit
big
to
be
easily
downed
this
beer
is
nevertheless
a
smooth
drinker
that
is
good
once
in
a
while
couldnt
see
myself
ejoying
this
on
a
regular
basis
though
mouthfeel
is
smooth
with
a
low
amount
of
carbonation
d
8abv
quite
well
hidden
a
decent
beer
but
there
are
others
from
mikkeller
others
that
id
spend
my
money
on
first
loved
it
and
im
glad
i
tried
it
to
start
out
with
this
aint
no
malt
liquor
like
ive
ever
seen
one
this
has
definitely
more
in
turn
with
a
big
ipaimperial
pilsner
then
the
label
makes
out
i
poured
a
750ml
bottle
into
my
new
belgium
goblet
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
orangehoney
with
a
huge
crest
white
strips
whitehead
that
receded
somewhat
leaving
some
pretty
hardcore
sticky
lacing
down
the
sides
of
my
glass
the
aroma
is
big
american
west
coast
hop
goodness
lots
of
orange
pink
grapefruit
and
a
bit
of
peach
this
is
nothing
like
any
other
malt
liquor
ive
been
privy
too
the
flavor
is
big
and
fruity
mostly
just
orange
and
lemon
from
the
hops
but
a
bit
of
malty
sweetness
muscles
its
way
thought
this
hop
bomb
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
crisp
like
most
well
done
lagers
this
is
a
great
beer
mikkeller
definitely
lives
up
to
their
reputation
of
taking
a
american
style
and
perfecting
it
but
in
its
perfection
it
looses
its
entirety
this
isnt
a
malt
liquor
the
label
is
100
incorrect
i
hope
the
boys
at
the
coop
really
push
inroad
with
this
brewery
ive
had
a
couple
of
their
beers
before
and
have
been
very
impressed
d
overall
draft
bear
is
another
very
tasty
brew
from
mikkeller
i
havent
had
a
beer
from
this
brewery
that
i
havent
enjoyed
great
stuff
mikkeller
does
a
good
job
with
this
lager
version
of
an
ipa
both
bittering
and
flavorful
hops
are
in
the
mix
over
a
crisp
and
refreshing
malt
backbone
recommended
this
beer
was
not
up
to
the
usual
standard
of
mikkeller
in
my
opinion
it
has
a
pretty
good
flavor
but
its
a
bit
like
an
average
west
coast
dipa
it
just
doesnt
come
together
entirely
it
certainly
has
some
pilsner
taste
but
its
much
bigger
with
the
grapefruitorange
hops
than
anything
else
the
beer
does
look
great
ill
give
it
that
huge
rocky
head
that
sticks
around
like
nobodys
business
its
ultimately
just
too
sweet
and
orangey
to
stick
with
for
long
its
like
eating
an
underripe
grapefruit
after
a
little
while
this
beer
might
be
a
lot
better
when
its
at
its
freshest
but
its
certainly
not
local
so
its
hard
to
correct
for
that
possibility
okay
beer
but
ill
stick
with
the
samuel
adams
hallertau
imp
pils
drinkability
is
pretty
good
i
started
out
really
loving
this
but
started
to
hit
a
wall
by
the
end
and
wish
id
served
it
colder
still
a
very
nice
imperial
pilsner
i
appreciate
the
robustness
of
the
hops
but
it
was
a
bit
too
rich
big
malt
warmth
hops
arent
insane
and
its
far
more
refreshing
and
easy
drinking
than
many
other
imperial
pilseners
d
it
was
a
very
well
constructed
beer
it
would
be
a
great
summer
beer
meant
for
a
hot
day
very
refreshing
ill
be
getting
more
of
this
style
overall
this
is
a
great
example
of
the
imperial
pilsner
style
doesnt
go
too
far
with
hoppiness
but
is
still
very
much
a
hop
driven
and
hop
flavorful
beer
the
interesting
malt
sweetness
is
what
intrigues
me
the
most
about
this
one
a
fine
example
of
the
sytle
by
mikkeller
pours
a
cloudy
golden
amber
orange
color
with
a
huge
foamy
offwhite
head
that
settles
into
a
lasting
lace
aroma
is
nicely
balanced
with
hints
of
citrus
peel
hops
crisp
fruit
pine
and
malt
very
quaffable
and
excelently
balanced
with
a
complex
flavors
nice
malty
backbone
balancing
out
sweet
crisp
fruit
lemon
and
orange
peel
and
a
nice
citrus
floral
hop
presence
that
lasts
throughout
alcohol
warmth
in
the
finish
it
seems
that
mikkeller
is
incapable
of
brewing
anything
but
good
beer
stateside
ipa
struisse
mikkeller
and
great
beer
beer
geek
breakfast
all
others
pale
and
jackie
brown
draft
bear
belongs
in
the
first
group
and
is
definitely
worth
a
purchase
for
anyone
even
remotely
interested
in
the
style
what
the
hell
is
draft
bear
anyway
while
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
the
thing
i
like
about
pilseners
is
the
noble
hops
cleanness
and
crispness
and
this
beer
seemed
mired
in
tropical
fruit
flavors
upon
checking
the
ingredients
i
see
that
this
beer
is
hopped
with
cascade
and
amarillo
doesnt
really
make
any
sense
to
use
zero
noble
hops
and
call
your
beer
a
pilsener
stylistically
this
beer
is
way
off
but
hedonistically
its
pretty
good
d
definitly
an
intriguing
flavor
with
some
booziness
and
mildew
nature
of
sour
citrus
and
sweet
candisugar
all
combining
to
make
this
a
must
try
there
was
some
noticeable
booziness
at
times
that
makes
this
an
honest
sipper
that
is
a
good
thing
because
i
wanted
this
beer
to
last
as
long
as
possible
very
drinkable
comes
in
750ml
so
you
cant
drink
a
whole
lot
but
if
youre
taking
your
time
it
is
a
delicious
beer
to
be
savored
very
wellcrafted
and
brewed
but
a
double
pils
drinks
pretty
easy
for
the
abv
a
very
good
take
on
the
style
a
little
more
hop
freshness
wouldnt
hurt
but
this
is
a
keeper
d
this
is
the
easiest
imp
pils
i
have
tasted
but
still
boldw
a
slightly
strong
quality
toward
the
end
but
the
noble
hops
and
mild
malt
w
subtle
warmth
of
8
cant
be
beat
for
the
750ml
was
too
easy
for
me
to
finish
especially
when
scanning
the
ba
forum
this
is
definitely
something
i
want
to
taste
again
i
highly
recommend
this
overall
this
was
a
very
enjoyable
sipper
that
im
glad
to
have
tried
wasnt
quite
what
i
expected
though
bottle
poured
a
deep
cloudy
copper
color
ale
with
a
large
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
good
lacing
aroma
of
european
dry
hops
is
totally
dominating
taste
is
a
mix
between
some
huge
dry
and
somewhat
floral
european
hops
and
a
huge
malt
base
full
body
with
some
great
carbonation
and
no
apparent
alcohol
very
well
done
for
the
style
but
this
is
a
style
that
i
have
a
hard
tie
to
dig
i
find
beer
tend
to
be
too
dry
pours
a
hazy
orangish
amber
with
huge
rocky
threefinger
white
puffy
head
that
lingers
for
ages
and
leaves
huge
clumps
of
lacing
on
the
way
down
aroma
is
big
on
hoppy
lemon
grass
up
front
but
not
overpoweringly
hoppy
with
heavy
bready
malt
smells
in
the
background
taste
is
similar
to
the
smell
with
some
citrus
hops
up
front
mainly
grapefruit
tones
this
gives
way
to
the
sweets
malts
and
some
spices
before
the
grassy
notes
come
back
with
a
crisp
clean
and
slightly
bitter
finish
mouthfeel
is
mediumbodied
and
slightly
astringent
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
great
example
of
a
strong
lagerpilsner
pours
golden
with
a
big
rocky
pure
white
head
that
sticks
around
a
bit
hazy
smell
is
slightly
sharp
and
hot
with
alcohol
pilsner
yeast
some
bready
notes
and
some
earthy
hops
taste
is
similar
it
has
more
of
a
lager
tang
from
the
yeast
and
isnt
as
clean
as
a
pilsner
it
is
also
not
as
exuberantly
hopped
as
the
sam
adams
hallertau
imperial
pilsner
tastes
more
like
a
high
quality
malt
liquor
to
me
which
is
what
the
bottle
says
the
bready
notes
are
still
there
but
they
are
a
bit
buried
by
spicy
earthy
hops
and
the
lager
yeast
as
well
as
some
caramel
and
buttery
notes
a
little
prickly
going
down
not
bad
but
not
exactly
my
cup
of
tea
nothing
really
remarkable
here
and
it
is
still
a
bit
raw
yellow
color
with
a
full
long
lasting
foam
well
hopped
nose
with
citrus
spicelike
lemony
and
fruity
hops
very
vibrant
flavor
is
very
punchy
with
loads
of
fruity
orange
tangerine
lemon
and
spicy
hops
also
some
notes
of
butter
toffee
and
caramel
as
well
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
from
mikkeller
one
of
the
better
imperial
pilsners
ive
had
brought
back
from
the
pnw
big
bottle
with
silver
foil
over
the
cork
and
cage
half
gold
beer
with
good
carbonation
and
half
actively
morphing
loose
head
bottle
says
malt
liquor
but
the
aroma
seems
much
nicer
than
that
aroma
is
light
but
seems
more
like
the
ghost
of
an
ipa
but
the
flavour
is
an
initial
alcohol
rush
and
then
an
enjoyable
fruity
hop
and
alcohol
mix
that
is
actually
quite
tasty
and
enjoyable
a
bit
of
a
sour
citrus
residue
in
the
mouth
kind
of
a
cross
between
a
tripel
and
a
malt
liquor
had
six
months
later
and
good
head
and
hoppy
aroma
pours
a
slightly
fogged
orange
gold
with
a
creme
head
that
leaves
a
fair
amount
of
lacing
flavor
is
a
bit
sweet
and
fairly
smooth
carries
a
bit
of
a
bite
to
it
that
only
has
a
touch
of
alcohol
to
it
massive
complexity
here
no
slight
hops
are
here
yes
but
not
a
whole
lot
really
when
you
look
at
it
the
strongest
part
of
this
beer
is
its
smooth
qualities
there
is
a
bit
of
a
tart
edge
to
it
feel
is
better
on
carbonation
than
liquid
but
still
nice
overall
this
is
very
drinkable
nothing
crazy
but
pretty
smooth
with
a
barely
noticed
alcohol
drinkability
actually
this
isnt
half
bad
though
it
is
a
bit
pricey
still
though
i
do
recommend
wrestling
with
the
draft
bear
pours
a
light
yellow
color
with
average
head
with
average
lacing
and
average
carbonation
the
dominate
smell
is
heavy
hops
and
mild
malts
first
taste
is
light
sweet
and
very
hoppy
for
the
style
light
in
body
and
taste
the
dominate
flavor
is
hops
not
bad
closer
to
an
ipa
than
a
lager
d
big
sweet
and
hoppy
makes
for
a
nice
big
tasty
pilsner
pours
a
mild
amber
hue
with
some
sunsin
highlights
very
thick
and
sticky
head
that
cant
help
but
cling
to
the
side
of
the
glass
not
to
mention
the
good
bubbling
carbonation
that
cant
help
to
be
seen
the
aroma
is
a
hoppy
pilsnery
ipa
malt
and
hop
bill
citric
hops
and
lager
yeasty
garss
herbs
the
first
sip
is
only
reminiscent
of
what
a
pilsner
might
be
dry
pilsner
malts
with
an
orange
zest
backbone
the
finish
is
an
herbal
and
peppery
hop
with
a
dry
lagery
pilsner
malt
the
palate
i
pretty
bitter
a
little
sweet
an
just
a
touch
rocky

great
double
pilsner

into
my
pilsnert

glass
a
hazed

with
a
large
fluffy
white
head
that
stuck
like
glue
to
the
glass

it
settled
very
slowly
big
grassy

herbal
hits
the
nostrils
on
impact
of
the
pour
then
a
honey
sweetness
as
a
well
as
some
mineral
shows
thru
just
nicely
balanced
with
a
real
pronounced
hop
profile
wow
the
flavors
of
this
double
pils
to
me
are
up
there
with
the
sam
adams
hallertau
pils
big
herbalspicey
hop
along
with
some
citric
hop
intermingling
with
caramel
and
honey
malt
is
just
great
a
great
beer
and
it
will
keep
hopheads
like
me
happy
but
stay
somewhat
true
to
styela
great
beer
loved
this
beer
d
the
guys
from
mikkeller
strike
again
this
is
an
excellent
beer
purchased
plaza
liquors
tucson
az
i
am
pretty
sure
i
got
a
good
deal
on
this
bottle
it
was
priced
at
6
99
for
750ml
the
color
was
a
hazy
orange
and
it
smelled
like
a
peppery
grassy
ipa
there
are
obviously
a
good
amount
of
hops
in
this
beer
the
first
taste
reminds
me
a
little
of
sam
adams
imperial
pilsner
a
very
fruity
hoppy
flavor
this
beer
has
convinced
me
to
drink
more
of
mikkellers
beers
d
at
8
this
is
a
big
pilsner
in
a
big
bottle
one
at
a
time
is
enough
for
me
but
this
one
does
go
down
nicely
poured
from
corked
and
caged
750ml
bottle
wonderful
amber
color
poured
with
a
nice
2
finger
head
slight
citrus
and
earthy
smell
complex
citrus
on
the
tongue
followed
by
slight
sweetness
and
nice
bitter
hop
bite
that
stays
with
you
dry
finish
speaks
to
the
high
abv
however
you
cannot
taste
the
alcohol
which
is
surprising
considering
this
brews
strength
very
tasty
so
many
imperial
pilsners
come
across
as
india
pale
lagers
this
doesnt
and
that
is
not
because
the
hops
arent
here
in
gaudy
abundance
they
are
for
a
beer
that
tries
to
break
the
rules
it
shows
the
base
style
in
its
distilled
purest
form
its
not
traditional
its
just
pilsener
drinkability
rather
good
and
somewhat
dangerous
considering
the
above
average
abv
10
imperial
pale
lager
that
pours
a
slightly
hazed
orange
gold
color
the
aroma
is
of
fresh
citrus
zest
green
tea
apricot
and
honey
the
flavor
has
more
of
the
intense
orange
citrus
note
substantial
bready
malt
but
bitter
alcohol
is
well
hidden
for
a
10
imperial
pils
but
its
still
there
hop
flavor
is
plentiful
with
semi
tropical
notes
and
some
herbal
elements
full
bodied
carbonated
lager
that
is
damn
smooth
another
winner
from
mikkeller
solid
hoppy
strong
lager
o
i
have
never
had
a
bad
beer
from
mikkeller
but
i
have
had
some
overrated
ones
this
beer
is
by
no
means
overrated
in
fact
i
dare
say
this
is
way
better
than
some
reviewers
make
it
sound
like
great

something
else
a

almost
like

tablet
does
feature
a
power
hop
flavor
that
to
my
reckoning
keeps
up
with
that
found
in
hop
burn
high
if
anything
the
lemon
orange
red
berry
salad
green
and
camphorous

flavors
are
even

here
despite
the

contributing
ample
sweetness

boozy
and
here
and
there
i
get
a
solventlike
blast
although
this
does
not
overly
detract
from
a
lingering
citrus
peel
lime
and
spicy
hop
finish
i
do
find
myself
enjoying
the
aroma
more
than
the
flavor
per
se
rather
thick
bodied
and
carbonation
is
right
where
it
needs
to
be
cutting
the
sweetness
to
some
extent
and
lifting
up
the
hops
i
rather
enjoyed
this
hop
burn
duo
bold
spicy
rich
boozy
beers
well
worth
experiencing
at
least
once
note
this
beer
is
in
no
way
a
pilsner
its
an
ipa
brewed
with
lager
yeast
and
has
more
in
common
with
those
it
is
not
an
imperialized
pilsner
a
veritable
hop
tsunami
that
does
a
number
on
your
senses
looks
great
while
the
aroma
offers
a
fantastic
smorgasbord
of
hop
notes
backed
up
by
malt
the
flavour
is
equally
intense
but
with
a
leafy
vegetal
edge
to
the
bitterness
that
detracts
a
little
from
the
experience
lovely
body
a
memorable
brew
but
not
one
id
want
to
drink
every
day
it
made
me
realise
that
it
is
possible
to
overdo
the
hops
nonetheless
an
impressive
lager
that
is
worth
sampling
if
you
really
love
lupulus
a
orange
cloudy
peachy
s
orange
peach
cream
t
malty
creamy
lemon
aggressive
orange
but
not
blatant
orange
m
again
creamy
aggressive
the
alcohol
burn
at
the
back
of
the
tongue
and
then
a
hop
presence
leftover
on
the
tongue
oim
really
glad
i
finally
got
a
mikkeller
i
was
thinking
of
getting
a
coffee
ipa
the
other
day
but
i
couldnt
part
with
my
precious
16
i
recommend
this
one
its
a
bit
of
a
mess
but
one
cant
stop
drinking
it
for
how
rewarding
it
is
with
flavors
galore
overall
a
more
aggressive
than
your
typical
ipl
beer
mix
of
crisp
lager
and
dipa
with
strong
focus
on
bitterness
still
an
interesting
drinkable
and
solid
beer
o
compared
to
the
imperial
pale
lagers
ipls
ive
had
this
one
tastes
the
most
like
an
ipa
and
the
only
discernable
difference
is
that
it
isnt
as
crisp
overall
a
typical
oddball
mikkeller
brew
this
is
an
intense
and
unique
beer
much
more
aggressive
than
other
takes
on
the
ipl
style
that
ive
had
this
emphasizes
the
bitterness
and
spiciness
more
than
anything
else
but
the
lager
characteristics
are
enough
to
keep
it
drinkable
not
a
sessioner
by
profile
or
abv
but
definitely
different
and
overall
solid
overall
this
is
quite
drinkable
with
the
hops
giving
it
a
good
bitterness
but
without
being
overpowering
i
was
expecting
something
more
overwhelming
and
while
there
is
some
good
hop
and
alcohol
burniness
here
there
is
still
some
maltiness
present
i
would
drink
this
again
if
it
wasnt
six
dollars
a
bottle
mikkeller
hop
burn
low
3
55
d
nice
hoppy
imperial
pilsner
nice
hop
profile
and
bitterness
throughout
o
not
so
obviously
delicious
as
hop
burn
high
but
subtler
and
more
interesting
i
like
this
series
duo
a
lot
and
would
highly
recommend
the
pair
bottle
poured
a
cloudy
beige
color
lager
with
a
large
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
lacing
aroma
of
dry
and
citrusy
hops
is
dominant
with
dry
caramel
malt
base
quite
discreet
taste
is
also
dominated
by
herbal
hops
notes
with
quite
dry
notes
and
a
medium
citrusy
finish
body
is
quite
full
with
good
carbonation
and
no
apparent
alcohol
the
description
is
spot
on
with
hops
being
the
dominant
flavour
and
honestly
i
could
not
have
known
that
this
was
lager
if
it
wasnt
for
the
label
c
slightly
darker
orange
unfiltered
with
a
finger
or
two
of
white
head
nose
has
some
pungent
citrus
big
caramel
malt
character
and
a
smidgen
of
pils
malt
slightly
spicy
hops
and
a
touch
of
alcohol
taste
has
a
load
of
sweet
caramelly
malt
bitter
citrus
hopping
and
slight
pils
malt
bitter
spicy
and
drying
finish
a
little
more
alcohol
a
big
beer
perhaps
more
than
i
bargained
for
this
eve
almost
like
an
american
style
bw
interesting
nonetheless
and
a
style
tick
too
much
carbonation
i
might
sit
on
one
of
these
and
see
how
a
few
years
treats
it
as
a
young
beer
it
already
reminds
me
of
a
barley
wine
and
i
see
some
aging
potential
with
this
one
one
of
the
strangely
more
agreeable
versions
of
the
style
the
grand
uptick
in
hopitude
perhaps
distracting
me
from
the
normal
alcohol
heat
problems
that
i
normally
seem
so
pissy
about
anyways
this
is
verily
a
dipa
but
without
the
big
caramel
sweetness
for
which
you
apparently
have
to
switch
over
to
the
hop
burn
high
to
experience
i
have
and
its
a
somewhat
more
fullon
affair
i
have
to
say
but
one
which
should
take
very
little
away
from
this
particular
incarnation
which
has
much
to
offer
all
on
its
own
o
this
is
a
great
example
of
a
high
octane
ipa
obviously
categorized
wrong
the
hop
flavour
mix
is
outstanding
and
it
is
dangerously
drinkable
peachy
coloured
body
the
good
bitterness
with
complex
hops
and
orange
juicy
citrus
is
up
front
and
immediate
malting
pretty
good
too
fuller
mouthfeel
in
your
face
like
a
double
ipa
very
tasty
good
drinkability
for
a
high

and
it
may
not
have
been
had
it
had
more

o
im

what
all
the
fuss
is
about

this
is
a
rather
solid
imperial
pilsner
but
compared
to
some
others
southern
tiers
krampus
rogues
morimoto
mikkellers
draft
bear
it
is
relatively
nondescript
i
mean
the
flavors
dont
really
separate
for
any
length
of
time
and
there
seems
to
be
little
integration
of
malt
and
hop
flavors
all
in
all
i
think
what
im
getting
at
is
that
there
just
isnt
a
ton
of
depth
here
if
youre
a
diehard
hophead
youll
likely
enjoy
this
lager
but
its
not
really
doing
anything
for
me
pale
coppery
gold
liquid
with
three
fingers
of
thick
rocky
foam
that
leaves
copious
lacing
very
attractive
smells
of
pine
cones

slightly

subtle

medium

holds

i
really
didnt
know
what
to
expect
based
on
the
label
a
very
nice
double
pilsner
o
this
is
a
solid
ipa
from
mikk
the
name
is
a
little
confusing
so
check
the
bottle
on
the
lower
right
hand
corner
the
dial
should
be
set
to
low
i
would
love
to
try
the
high
after
trying
this
one
check
it
out
its
a
fun
beer
overall
4
5
this
was
one
of
the
very
few
occasions
that
ive
given
something
a
five
on
the
taste
part
of
a
review
this
was
awesome
just
great
and
i
want
some
more
really
dug
the
mint
character
in
the
hop
profile
too
price
and
dating
issues
will
prevent
me
from
spending
too
much
on
mikkeller
but
knowing
that
the
guys
capable
of
this
kind
of
stuff
im
going
to
be
making
the
leap
a
bit
more
often
from
now
on
highly
recommended
if
its
likely
to
be
fresh
the
body
is
sticky
and
full
with
lingering
flavors
overall
this
is
pretty
tasty
but
seems
more
like
a
hoppy
pale
than
a
pilsner
well
done
good
balance
and
the
10
abv
do
not
show
thumbs
up
im
glad
i
took
the
chance
on
this
not
a
style
that
you
find
a
lot
of
so
id
hope
that
port
delivers
on
this
unfortunately
it
misses
the
mark
for
me
a
bit
too
much
booze
and
not
enough
character
drinkable
sure
but
the
whole
thing
could
be
a
lot
better
one
of
my
least
favorite
from
port
d
pretty
drinkable
feels
a
bit
rough
and
a
bit
warm
needed
some
more
flavors
to
balance
out
the
body
and
booze
a
big
thick
and
heavy
imperial
pilsner
theres
nothing
here
i
particularly
liked
and
i
didnt
finish
my
pint
though
this
is
not
at
all
a
bad
beer
appearance
is
a
deep
yellow
with
a
12
finger
head
that
leaves
some
lace
after
a
few
sips
it
has
a
smell
of
sugar
hops
lemon
and
bread
the
taste
has
grass
hops
lemon
and
a
bit
of
grapefuit
a
sweet
beer
mf
is
lightmedium
with
moderate
carbonation
a
good
imperial
pilsner
which
cloacks
its
abv
well
so
be
sure
to
sip
just
popped
the
top
of
a
stinger
of
panzer
pilsner
from
port
brewering
and
poured
in
to
my
new
fish
bowl
thick
chalice
style
glass
the
beer
pour
a
orange
cloudy
color
with
very
thin
white
head
the
scent
carried
alcohol
and
sweetness
from
an
orange
peel
the
taste
is
heavy
with
alcohol
and
the
attempted
balance
of
malt
and
hop
the
body
is
full
making
this
a
big
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
downgraded
due
to
teh
alcohol
i
am
glad
to
have
tried
it
tho
o
as
much
as
i
think
this
is
a
dumb
style
i
really
do
like
this
beer
and
most
others
like
it
as
they
liven
up
a
boring
beer
and
add
flavor
to
it
this
is
a
very
easy
to
drink
beer
and
ont
thats
worth
getting
if
you
see
it
around
poured
a
clear
copper
color
with
an
average
frothy
white
head
that
was
lasting
and
produced
excellent
lacing
good
moderate
to
heavy
earthy
leather
hop
and
small
malt
aroma
medium
to
full
body
with
a
smooth
dry
slick
texture
and
soft
carbonation
moderate
to
heavy
bittersweet
flavor
with
with
a
moderate
to
heavy
bittersweet
finish
of
moderate
to
long
duration
this
is
a
standout
beer
and
best
of
style
i
have
had
would
be
a
very
good
beer
if
the
alcohol
heat
was
tamed
a
little
bit
but
nonetheless
still
likeable
nice
beer

your

will
never

the

of
this

just
seems
to
be
escaping

drink
this
was
a
nice
beer
tasty
and
flavorful
and
pretty
balanced
a
bit
of
a
leaner
to
the
malty
side
i
might
not
come
back
to
this
one
was
a
bit
thick
for
me
in
terms
of
style
totally
out
of
control
head
easily
fills
half
the
glass
with
an

just
offwhite
with
a
loose

you
really
feel
it
pop
against

you
sip

however
more
raw

than
might
be

with

the

sneaky
in
how
it
covers

cheek

to
add
further
fluff
at

much
sweeter
than
the

might
suggest

apple
peach
apricot

competent
still
gets
successively
drier
towards
the

offers
less

dough

than

maybe
its
the
dryness
keeps
the
hoppy
bite
while
avoiding
bitterness
just
leaves
you
feeling
its
more
of
a
dipa
than
anything
else
that
said
its
fun
albeit
more
interesting
than
mindlessly
enjoyable
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
and
a
decent
ip
i
may
never
find
another
i
truly
love
but
i
will
keep
looking
o
good
beer
but
will
probably
wait
till
next
year
to
drink
again

first
beer
of
the
night

paired
with

also
this
beer
had
a
very
clean
and
crisp
taste
which
i
enjoyed
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
the
drinkablility
was
easy
surprised
to
see
an

of
9
5
on
the
bottle
dangerous
would
never
guess
that
highly
drinkable
and
high
in

might
be
an
interesting
combination
i
can
feel
the
buzz
already
9
5
at
the
end
of
this
bomber
duh
and
the
lack
of
redeeming
flavors
fails
to
make
this
the
imperial
pilsner
to
make
me
like
imperial
pilsners
linger
3
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
strong
kick
good
representation
of
style
its
a
decent
beer
but
there
are
others
in
the
style
that
i
would
choose
first
d
they
need
to
rework
this
one
before
ill
touch
it
again
at
present
its
a
mixed
bag
an
unusual
beer
that
doesnt
really
fit
the
style
flavor
and
feel
are
too
heavy
to
hold
much
pilsner
character
very
malty
with
spicy
german
hop
and
a
belgianesque
yeasty
funk
overall
a
rather
bland
big
beer
so
over
the
top
sweet
and
grainy
it
doesnt
really
have
much
pilsner
quality
to
it
d
very
good
beer
and
definitely
should
be
in
the
top
5
in
its
class
d
thank
goodness
its
not
as
bad
as
before
actually
its
pretty
decent
im
still
somewhat
skeptical
but
for
now
this
beer
has
redeemed
itself
md
medium
bodied
carbonation
is
slightly
high
drinkability
is
pretty
good
overall
a
solid
if
not
outstanding
beer
really
interesting
highly
recommended
for
anyone
who
likes
pilsners
hops
and
big
brews
i
couldnt
see
myself
putting
away
more
than
a
bombers
worth
though
poured
from
a
22oz
into
my
ommegang
goblet
really
nice
white
fluffy
foamy
head
about
2
fingers
high
decent
retention
and
laces
quite
nicely
smells
straight
up
pilsnery
spicy
appley
cant
wrap
my
mind
around
the
flavor
a
medium
malty
sweetness
but
then
theres
the
german
hops
a
good
deep
lingering
bitterness
nice
piney
spiciness
but
then
theres
the
sweetness
nice
carbonated
mouthfeel
creamy
tastes
a
bit
hot
though
d
drinkability
is
actually
very
good
for
an
imperial
pils
while
there
is
a
slight
alcohol
tang
it
never
becomes
too
obtrusive
d
dont
really
like
the
pilsner
style
but
i
guess
double
the
ingridients
make
the
cut
d
not
a
fan
clear
golden

some

slowly

head
significant
lacing
very
hoppy
nose

smells
like

malts
overwhelmed
by

taste
is
tres
hoppy
spicy
with
a
bit
of
noble
pine
a
bit
of
sweet
malts
on
back
end
but
once
again
subsumed
by
hops
mouthfeel
is
full
some
effervescence
very
confusing
beer
not
close
to
style
alcohol
quite
prevalent
at
this
high
abv
one
is
enough
too
be
honest
i
dont
get
a
pilsener
taste
as
much
as
i
do
a
imperial
pale
ale
like
lompoc
cnote
worth
a
try
for
those
bas
looking
for
uberhoppy
pilseners
my
first
foray
into
imperial
pilsners
and
most
likely
my
last
not
that
this
was
a
bad
beer
its
simply
that
pilsners
are
brewed
the
way
they
are
for
a
reason
theyre
light
and
refreshing
an
imperial
pilsner
this
one
at
least
is
neither
it
smells
decent
enough
with
a
bit
of
the
lemonyorange
that
a
regular
pilsner
has
but
doesnt
have
much
of
a
head
and
it
tastes
decent
enough
with
a
modicum
of
lemon
and
fizz
but
not
enough
of
either
to
really
do
the
job
of
a
pilsner
the
9
5
abv
is
not
a
huge
presence
theres
almost
no
warmth
thank
goodness
and
theres
no
scent
of
alcohol
to
speak
of
the
extra
malt
is
nice
and
the
citrus
from
the
extra
hops
is
okay
but
surprisingly
enough
theres
not
a
lot
of
bite
in
fact
ive
had
plenty
of
regular
pilsners
that
packed
more
sting
ill
stick
with
those
d
very
good
i
approve
4
0
d
pretty
easy
to
get
down
just
not
entirely
sure
id
want
to
do
tons
of
this
not
unpleasant
but
wont
miss
this
one
if
i
dont
cross
it
again
this
is
a
very
interesting
beer
as
i
havent
seen
many
imperial
pilsners
out
there
considering
a
pils
is
a
difficult
style
to
brew
and
given
the
fact
port
can
squeeze
9
5
out
of
this
beer
im
really
impressed
coming
from
port
brewing
i
expected
this
to
be
an
extreme
beer
and
one
that
would
be
heavily
hopped
as
they
seem
to
do
on
many
of
the
beers
especially
the
ipas
which
is
why
they
have
become
one
of
my
favorite
craft
brewers
nice
job
pbc
port
brewings
panzer
imperial

is
interesting
i
find
every
imperial
pilsner
interesting
because
i
dont
quite
understand
it
good
beer
when
its
going
down
but
bitter
after
would
be
complemented
by
some
cheese
perhaps
but
what
wouldnt
another
beer
made
in
the
west
coast
huge
in
all
aspects
needs
something
to
balance
out
that
finnish
is
it
the
water
tastes
like
it
smells
big
and
well
balanced
only
the
hops
are
much
more
aggressive
much
more
varied
big
yeast
sweet
bread
sourdough
weeds
flowers
grapefruit
raisins
very
very
nice
drinkability
is
pretty
good
a
satisfyingly
sturdy
pils
and
fine
example
of
the
style
but
not
one
i
need
another
of
anytime
soon
overall
for
a
pils
it
was
pretty
good
not
your
typical
skunky
tasting
brew
not
bad
but
not
what
i
hoped
for
i
cant
believe
i
think
a
port
beer
needs
more
hops
overall
this
is
a
loaded
brew
in
terms
of
flavor
and
balance
it
lives
to
its
name
of
an
extreme
pilsner
d
meh
id
pass
on
a
second
bottle
knock
this
sucker
in
half
and
i
think
itd
be
a
pretty
damn
good
pilsner
but
this
is
just
too
much
this
beer
is
in
no
way
offensive
but
it
just
doesnt
work
for
me
ill
have
no
problem
finishing
the
bomber
it
isnt
too
bad
for
overall
drinking
but
theres
just
better
beers
in
this
priceabv
range
that
id
rather
spend
my
money
on
overall
i
liked
it
better
when
i
had
it
the
first
time
on
tap
and
will
likely
try
it
again
but
this
sample
didnt
live
up
to
my
memory
of
the
first
sample
though
the
pilsner
character
is
identifiable
this
is
an
iipa
not
an
imperial
pilsner
in
my
view
its
an
interesting
brew

overall
a
good
solid
beer
it
is
definitely
beyond
seasonable
but
at
7
abv
one
could
have
a
few
for
sure
give
it
a
shot
if
you
see
it
hoppy
with
a
lager
base
good
but
slightly
different
lite
enough
to
drink
all
day
very
good
beer
overall
not
a
pale
or
ipa
but
close
to
a
pale
ale
as
the
name
suggests
drinks
like
a
lager
but
at
5
2
abv
puts
you
in
a
good
spot
i
really
wish
it
wasnt
a
limited
edition
this
has
grown
to
be
one
of
my
favorites
when
im
not
in
the
mood
for
something
heavier
this
beer
tasted
like
it
was
trying
to
hard
nice
hoppy
character
but
overall
the
sweetness
was
a
little
too
high
it
was
good
id
drink
it
again
but
it
just
seemed
to
be
not
all
together
the
floral
notes
on
the
smell
arent
strong
enough
in
my
opinion
id
like
to
try
this
right
after
it
was
bottled
pretty
smooth
finish
but
overall
just
a
tad
bland
as
i
am
just
beginning
my
foray
into
lagers
i
would
put
this
in
the
group
of
beers
ill
likely
not
buy
again
since
it
wont
be
there
anyway
but
will
certainly
drink
if
offered
i
found
it
to
fall
on
the
subtle
side
of
the
flavor
profiles
of
fathom
keep
in
mind
i
am
very
early
in
this
lager
game
and
my
hopheadedness
is
still
informing
me
i
will
in
time
learn
to
extract
and
appreciate
the
crisp
much
as
i
now
crave
the
funk
in
belgians
where
before
that
was
an
acquired
taste

o

overall
a
good
beer
for

but
one
i
find
does
not
play

to
the
lager
aspects
of
its

great
i
p
l
always
enjoy
beer
from
sierra
nevada
this
one
does
not
disappoint
the
name
is
all
you
need
its
a

lager
smells
like
a
lager
with
some
floral
hops
taste
a

with

hops
wife
thought
it
was
an
ipa
crisp
slightly

finish
like
this
one
better
than
the
ballast
point
collaboration
ipl
too
bad
they
say
it
is
a
one
time
only
beer
be
great

was
quite
fresh
and
somewhat
lightmedium
bodied
there
was
also
a
crisp
quality
that
reminded
me
of
a
quaffable
tropical
beach
beer
the
7
alcohol
is
well
hidden
and
it
can
sneak
up
on
you
if
youre
not
careful
very
interesting
lager
perfect
for
the
warm
spring
months
ahead
its
a
very
drinkable
beer
goes
down
smooth
not
to
hoppy
good
taste
o
nice
summer
beer
very
sessionable
its
like
a
lighter
ipa
would
drink
again
calling
or
a
barbeque
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
very
thick
foamy
head
head
retention
and
lacing
are
excellent
has
a
crisp
piney
citrus
floral
aroma
nice
hoppy
taste
with
a
citrus
astringent
aftertaste
there
is
a
little
breadiness
in
the
beginning
the
lager
taste
is
detected
at
the
end
very
good
beer
very
impressed
best
attempt
at
a
pilsner
meets
ipa
that
i
have
had
love
the
pale
ale
start
to
the
taste
the
aftertaste
is
where
you
taste
more
of
the
booze
than
the
lager
still
too
much
booze
but
i
loved
it
none
the
less
if
they
can
master
this
they
wont
just
be
making
this
a
seasonal
beer
overall
pilsner
meets
ipa
very
interesting
collaboration
fresh
flavors
make
this
a
very
refreshing
beer
top
notch
overall
not
bad
but
nothing
special
ill
use
my
liver
for
other
spirits
going
forward
very
nice
easy
drinking
beer
smells
of
pepper
and
grapefruit
has
a
nice
hoppy
malty
taste
that
finishes
clean
nice
little
hoppy
lager
clean
and
refreshing
overall
this
is
a
nice
double
pils
but
i
would
like
a
touch
less
hops
a
good
hoppy
lager
definite
pils
notes
but
not
a
full
on
pils
crisp
lager
with
some
bite
floral
hop
profile
mint
leaf
lemon
zest
much
better
than
i
thought
it
would
be
very
easy
to
drink
hides
the
7
0
very
well
citra
hops
give
it
some
damn
good
flavor
some
hop
with
a
pils
background
good
crisp
and
bitter
aftertaste
o
very
nicely
balanced
very
easy
drinkability
even
at
7
0
that
is
six
pack
worthy
labeled
as
a
hoppy
pilsner
with
a
good
balance
would
seek
out
and
purchase
again
very
enjoyable
even
though
im
trying
not
to
drink
during
the
week
i
couldnt
resist
since
i
picked
it
up
yesterday
88
on
ba
some
gave
it
mediocre
reviews
made
in
collaboration
with
ballast
point
bottled
mid
january
its
dangerous
light
ipa
tasty
7
tastes
like
5
i
could
drink
quite
a
few
9

at
wegmans
rating
4
85
its
sweet
and
hoppy
a
deliteful
new
formula
that
would
have
appeal
to
ipa
newbies
o
there
were
several
other
offerings
in
last
years
beer
camp
that
shouldve
been
considered
over
this
one
maillards
odyssey
the
coffee
stout
its
ok
just
not
exciting
o
much
taste
for
a
lager
was
excited
to
try
this
one
but
thought
it
just
wasnt
as
hoppy
as
i
thought
it
would
be
and
the
lager
yeast
was
a
bit
overpowering
the
hops
yum
wife
brought
home
a
sixer
as
a
surprise
id
never
seen
it
before
what
can
i
tell
you
just
a
clean
crisp
hoppy
quite
drinkable
lager
was
shocked
that
this
was
7
as
it
drinks
very
easily
great
job
on
this
one
sn
overall
an
improvement
from
the
electric
ray
by
lowering
the
abv
more
clean
and
crisp
than
the
original
beer
camp
iteration
incredibly
refreshing
and
crushable
eminently
drinkable
one
of
the
best
sierra
nevada
offerings
in
my
opinion
loaded
with
hop
flavor
but
not
overdone
excellent
paired
with
food
or
alone
good
quality
beer
sierra
nevada
has
once
again
out
done
there
competition
it
has
a
smooth
taste
not
watered
down
and
not
to
mention
7
abv
without
the
strong
alcohol
taste
i
dont
consider
myself
a
expert
but
i
have
drank
many
beers
if
your
looking
for
a
good
complex
lager
this
is
it
this
is
not
for
the
weak
hearted
but
for
the
men
who
like
a
good
strong
quality
beer
just
my
opinion
of
course
india
pale
lager
or
pilsner
this
one
comes
across
like
a
melding
of
the
two
styles
the
clean
grassy
dry
crackery
aspects
of
the
pilsner
as
present
while
at
the
other
end
await
kisses
of
kiwi
and
pineapple
its
a
medium
bodied
beer
which
drinks
almost
as
easy
as
a
pilsner
an
accomplishment
given
the
abv
clocks
in
at
7
cheers
to
sierra
nevada
for
this
experiment
that
worked
was
surprised
to
see
this
at
my
walmart
so
had
to
pick
it
up
and
try
very
enjoyable
not
as
hoppy
as
the
name
would
suggest
nice
combo
however
of
a
hoppy
taste
with
an
obvious
lager
nose
pine
grassy
hops
citrus
rinds
toasted
malts
cereal
floral
taste
sweet
citrus
peppery
floral
toasted
grains
slight
resin
nice
not
life
changing
but
a
seriously
solid
ipl
light
crisp
hoppy
i
think
55ibus
is
a
bit
of
an
under
statement
and
how
can
you
beat
a
good
beer
thats
7
and
under
11
a
6pk
gold
and
so
frickin
clear
head
dissipates
quickly
fruity
hops
and
pine
in
the
nose
along
with
malt
sweetness
those
all
come
balanced
in
the
flavor
with
a
healthy
dose
of
bitterness
a
touch
of
cloying
sweetness
gives
it
a
little
more
body
and
keeps
it
from
being
smooth
i
do
like
the
floral
finish
though
worth
trying
overall
i
will
drink
this
wherever
i
can
find
it
this
pours
a
clear
gold
tan
with
a
great
foamy
cap
theres
a
bright
aroma
of
a
lightly
fruity
citrusy
hop
with
a
piney
finish
this
has
a
great
flavor
to
it
with
a
drying
pine
finish
tasty
for
some
reason
it
doesnt
stick
around
in
the
fridge
here
pours
clear
corn
color
with
everlasting
white
head
smells
of
fresh
grains
citrus
pine
some
floral
tastes
of
fresh
grains
cereal
citrus
pine
floral
and
a
boozy
warmth
medium
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
niiiice
love
this
beer
great
aroma
with
hop
and
lager
stank
this
beer
has
helped
me
to
enjoy
lager
since
again
the
taste
has
a
toasted
pale
malt
presence
that
is
quickly
overtaken
by
the
soapy
melonlike
hop
character
lingering
at
the
end
i
like
it
as
a
sixpack
beer
but
i
also
definitely
wouldnt
write
home
about
it
o
3
75
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
found
it
rather
onedimensional
lightly
hazy
light
golden
color
with
a
huge
bone
white
head
wow
that
is
dank
i
think
im
getting
a
contact
high
huge
piney
pitchy
resinous
aromas
dominate
if
theres
malt
underneath
i
cant
find
it
the
flavor
is
light
crackery
malt
with
a
bit
more
spice
than
pine
in
the
flavor
smooth
bitterness
with
a
lingering
spice
medium
body
with
a
moderate
carbonation
damn
i
should
have
bought
more
than
just
a
single
im
rally
digging
this
i
like
this
hoppy
lager
it
pours
a
pale
golden
with
white
head
that
is
leaving
a
nice
lace
the
scent
carries
floral
hop
the
taste
is
well
balanced
between
malt
and
hops
which
bring
spice
and
citrus
the
mouthfeel
is
fuller
in
body
with
smooth
carbonation
overall
extremely
solid
bottle
pours
a
vivid
honey
color
like
all
sierra
nevada
beeyaz
this
one
sports
a
textbook
cap
of
foam
i
dont
always
like
their
beers
but
goddamn
do
they
look
the
part
i
was
initially
impressed
by
the
nose
its
hoppy
for
sure
yet
there
is
a
very
clean
pilsner
malt
it
actually
smells
like
an
amplified
pilsner
ipso
facto
an
imperial
pilsner
got
it
now
im
on
the
right
track
as
i
digress
i
will
say
most
of
these
hip
new
hoppy
lagerspilsners
seem
to
be
ipas
with
different
strain
of
yeast
this
one
smells
closer
to
its
ancestry
its
still
a
pils
the
flavor
keeps
most
of
what
i
was
yapping
about
right
before
its
sweeter
and
loses
a
bit
of
its
charisma
but
its
still
tasty
its
not
the
tunnelvisioned
hop
bomb
i
was
expecting
its
done
well
the
yeasty
flavors
manage
to
stay
crisp
despite
the
high
abv
its
plenty
hoppy
and
it
keeps
its
pilsner
malt
profile
i
was
not
expecting
to
like
this
sierra
nevada
did
a
collaboration
beer
in
their
last
beer
camp
package
electric
ray
was
the
name
it
was
the
same
style
per
se
and
the
label
art
was
nearly
identical
i
did
not
enjoy
it
i
expected
a
reincarnation
of
electric
ray
this
offering
is
far
from
it
i
liked
this
a
lot
hoppy
with
a
crisp
taste
drinkable
overall
im
not
a
big
lager
fan
but
this
drinks
more
like
an
ipa
nice
to
sample
but
not
a
goto
beer
for
me
3
25
another
chuggable
by
sierra
nevada
though
this
could
be
sipped
a
bit
slower
and
still
enjoyed
i
at
first
loved
this
beer
it
was
hoppy
and
flavorful
but
my
opinion
has
recently
changed
ive
recently
noticed
how
extremely
heavy
this
beer
is
i
feel
extremely
full
and
pretty
bloated
every
time
i
drink
it
i
never
have
this
problem
with
an
average
west
coast
ipa
by
not
carry
the
ipa
label
and
still
being
pretty
good
tasting
and
hoppy
it
should
earn
respect
but
i
will
probably
not
buy
it
again
in
terms
of
sierra
nevada
i
will
be
headed
towards
the
torpedo
or
seasonal
ipas
again
poured
a
clear
straw
gold
with
one
finger
head
and
lace
pactchesring
aroma
is
floweryfloral
with
just
tiny
amounts
of
citric
zip
and
spice
in
the
hops
along
with
a
little
graininess
light
bodied
crisp
easy
drinking
lager
with
some
floral
hops
and
spice
with
a
dry
finish
not
my
favorite
beer
at
all
but
it
is
pleasant
great
ipl
love
it
just
like
the
electric
ray
from
2014
as
billed
a
hoppy
take
on
the
domestic
lager
underwhelming
not
my
favorite
among
their
brews
overall
quite
different
from
just
about
all
the
lagers
ive
tasted
before
but
in
a
very
nice
way
being
a
bit
of
a
hophead
myself
this
beer
has
the
best
of
both
worlds
the
subtleness
and
complexity
of
a
great
lager
and
the
hop
punch
of
an
ipa
winner
winner
chicken
dinner
overall
very
underwhelmed
but
at
least
i
only
spent
1
49
on
the
single
i
thought
it
was
lacking
in
just
about
every
category
compared
to
other
similar
offerings
a
very
nice
hoppy
lager
feels
like
a
smooth
hoppy
ipa
very
taste
for
sure
to
grab
while
it
lasts
the
taste
is
very
good
with
a
nice
hop
flavor
and
gentle
astringent
element
with
floral
presence
and
lemony
lightly
bitter
hop
with
mild
grassy
flavor
with
mostly
dry
finish
overall
a
a
well
done
hoppy
lager
one
of
the
better
imperial
pilsnersipls
i
have
tried
another
winner
from
sierra
nevada
hoppy
but
fits
the
smooth
crisp
character
of
a
lager
not
quite
what
i
expected
a
very
sharp
assertive
and
boozy
brew
i
thought
it
was
as
it
says
a
hoppy
lager
the
abv
wasnt
on
the
12pack
box
i
bought
so
i
was
surprised
it
was
an
imperial
pilsner
i
feel
like
pilsner
is
better
left
alone
than
transformed
into
anything
imperial
but
it
is
a
good
beer
just
not
a
hoppy
session
lager
like
id
hoped
for
amped
up
lager
at
7
abv
with
some
malt
liquor
qualities
always
love
the
creative
names
sierra
nevada
gives
to
these
beer
camp
offerings
gold
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
brass
topped
by
a
halffinger
of
offwhite
foam
the
nose
is
nearly
nonexistent
for
me
though
some
minor
notes
of
dank
greens
and
leek
struggle
to
push
through
at
times
the
taste
holds
notes
of
pine
onion
light
bread
and
grass
though
not
completely
offensive
i
would
almost
rather
these
flavors
be
as
meek
as
the
smell
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
dry
finish
overall
i
was
not
a
fan
of
this
hoppy
lager
at
all
many
aspects
were
muted
and
then
what
sensory
inputs
outputs
hmm
were
there
werent
all
that
pleasing
to
my
organs
oh
well
snll
likely
make
it
up
to
me
with
their
next
offering
so
no
big
loss
here
12
oz
bottle
poured
into
stemless
wine
glass
on
3feb15
something
claiming
to
be
a
hoppy
lager
better
have
the
characteristics
of
both
an
ipa
and
a
lager
and
this
definitely
hits
the
mark
both
the
citrus
aromas
and
flavors
of
an
ipa
are
blended
with
the
earthy
grass
aromas
and
flavors
of
a
lager
solid
stuff
this
is
an
excellent
offering
that
should
be
brewed
regularly
not
just
onetime
only
o
i
got
into
beer
through
craft
beer
and
was
hooked
with
that
said
i
kind
of
skipped
lagers
for
my
first
3
years
however
recently
i
have
been
exploring
the
different
lager
varieties
and
dang
this
is
sooo
delicious
another
great
offering
for
sn
at
a
great
price
point
o
solid
and
would
drink
again
but
nothing
to
get
excited
about
i
would
probably
enjoy
their
psle
ale
a
bit
more
pours
a
very
bright
amber
yellow
with
a
huge
white
foamy
head
the
smell
is
floral
citrus
and
grassy
taste
is
very
crisp
peppery
grass
then
flows
straight
into
citrus
bitter
town
on
the
finish
bitterness
really
lingers
reminiscent
of
a
kolsch
but
with
more
hops
very
crisp
and
light
on
the
tongue
with
a
vibrant
carbonation
overall
a
nice
drinking
beer
the
crisp
light
malts
really
work
with
the
bright
citrus
hops
check
it
out
for
sure
o
a
very
good
ipl
that
they
arent
calling
an
ipl
there
are
better
offerings
out
there
but
this
one
wins
on
availability
good
hop
flavors
and
nice
malt
balance
not
the
most
complex
thing
out
there
but
it
definitely
isnt
boring
amazing
beer
you
definitely
want
to
seek
this
golden
colored
beauty
out
this
beer
has
a
lot
to
offer
loaded
with
classic
lager
flavors
with
an
awesome
kick
of
whole
cone
hops
the
nose
for
this
beer
has
big
citrus
hop
aroma
a
nice
underlining
of
sweetness
and
a
mild
amount
of
maltiness
the
taste
of
this
beer
was
amazing
and
complex
the
whole
cone
hops
shine
right
on
through
nice
and
big
citrus
grapefruit
stands
out
a
bit
of
bitterness
55
ibus
and
it
balances
the
bitterness
with
a
nice
malt
sweetness
the
texture
of
this
beer
is
excellent
as
well
i
love
the
classic
ipa
spin
on
a
lager
platform
great
beer
sierra
nevada
o
a
nice
hoppy
lager
definitely
worth
seeking
out
well
done
will
pick
this
up
again

character
as
well
mouthfeel
is
light
in
body
with
a
lively
carbonation
falling
just
shy
of
crisp
overall
a
decent
hoppy
lager
but
not
in
the
same
ballpark
as
jas
hoppy
lagers
this
is
my
super
bowl
beer
for
2015
its
a
fantastic
golden
ipaish
beer
the
palate
opens
with
a
moderate
bready
lager
flavor
very
cleanly
fermented
with
a
pleasing
hop
character
focused
and
precise
theres
a
blend
of
pine
honey
and
a
little
citrus
fresh
and
complex
playing
quite
nicely
with
the
bready
and
doughy
lager
base
the
flaw
however
is
the
higher
than
needed
abv
at
7
this
does
have
a
warming
character
thats
not
wholly
needed
medium
in
body
with
moderate
carbonation
this
has
a
blend
of
sweetness
and
hop
bitterness
on
the
finish
solid
wow
sierra
nevada
kills
it
again
firstly
this
beer
looks
gorgeous
deep
copper
lots
of
bubbles
a
hefty
head
that
lingers
for
just
the
right
time
heavy
dry
hopped
cannabislike
smell
taste
is
the
best
i
dont
have
a
refined
palate
but
im
almost
positive
im
getting
cascade
hops
an
upfront
hop
taste
with
a
pleasent
metallic
taste
that
lingers
lagering
is
what
makes
this
beer
id
describe
this
as
a
1
12
ipa
the
layering
takes
what
id
call
a
double
ipa
and
makes
an
amazingly
drinkable
and
refreshing
beer
full
of
flavor
at
7
abv
this
had
boy
can
be
sneaky
buy
this
asap
and
please
sierra
nevada
dont
keep
this
as
a
one
time
release
please
while
initial
impressions
werent
overwhelming
the
flavor
and
mouthfeel
definitely
grab
a
hold
of
your
palate
the
abv
resides
nicely
in
the
background
while
gently
sweet
malt
character
and
gentle
hop
bitterness
do
a
nicely
complementary
dance
with
each
other
wellbalanced
decent
complexity
and
depth
and
very
easy
drinking
better
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
get
it
while
you
can
b
the
taste
is
good
and
crisp
but
with
enough
body
to
give
it
a
great
wash
that
gives
the
palate
time
to
rake
in
the
malt
i
really
hate
lagers
sorry
budweiser
but
here
we
have
a
meld
that
works
keep
it
cold
my
friends

poured
into

aroma
has
a
bit
of
czech
pilsner
scent
along
with
some
citrus
lager
up
front
with
some
citrusy
bitterness
on
the
end
a
solid
ipl
that
i
could
drink
a
number
of
nicely
done
brew
master
nearly
perfect
overall
at
7
this
isnt
quite
session
able
but
it
has
that
crisp
taste
about
it
probably
a
beer
to
get
in
trouble
with
on
a
warm
summer
evening
on
the
deck
this
beer
kinda
sucks
for
a
sierra
nevada
pale
yellow
in
color
with
a
slight
haze
poured
with
a
short
dense
white
foam
with
good
retention
as
the
foam
is
constantly
fed
by
migrating
bubbles
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
sheets
of
thick
lacings
are
left
on
the
glass
intense
citrus
floral
and
minty
hop
aromas
with
malty
aromas
at
the
back
end
medium
bodied
with
moderate
to
aggressive
carbonation
through
the
middle
and
a
slight
puckering
feel
a
touch
of
boozy
heat
toward
the
finish
flavors
similar
to
aromas
with
intense
citrus
floral
and
minty
hop
flavors
with
a
malty
backbone
balancing
out
the
heavy
hop
character
mediumhigh
bitterness
through
the
middle
finished
cleanly
crisp
and
dry
with
a
lingering
hop
bitterness
and
light
bready
pilsnerlike
aftertaste
good
allaround
lager
the
hops
add
a
nice
punch
but
arent
overwhelming
mostly
light
citrus
and
floral
notes
has
some
latent
bitterness
but
still
refreshing
i
love
this
this
is
a
solid
beer
but
it
feels
heavy
its
not
refreshing
at
all
i
guess
its
not
what
i
was
expecting
but
its
still
a
hoppy
lager
so
hey
o
good

hopefully
this

nothing
bad
so
far
the

is
bitter
sweet
with
a
smooth

you
also
pick
up
on

this

of

i
will
certainly
pick
this
up
again
during
the
spring
when
its
above
freezing
in
my
area
classically
sn
in
balance
hops
are
pleasantly
and
surprisingly
clean
perhaps
the
best
ipl
ive
tried
which
is
just
moderate
praise
its
a
good
beer
smell
is
great
for
a
lager
subpar
for
a
hoppy
beer
taste
is
exceptional
for
a
lager
subpar
for
a
hoppy
beer
i
think
part
of
this
subpar
experience
is
there
choice
of
hops
for
this
beer
internet
search
wait
a
second
palisade
el
dorado
citra
equinox
that
couldnt
necessarily
be
it
some
of
the
greatest
ipas
are
made
with
citra
surly
abrasive
psuedo
sue
zombie
dust
and
probably
odell
ipa
and
laguinitas
sucks
although
im
not
sure
there
is
any
reason
to
use
palisade
hops
blah
in
anything
not
familiar
with
equinox
though
had
beers
ive
enjoyed
that
have
ad
el
dorado
hops
so
i
think
thats
a
good
hop
too
warming
up
the
beer
reminds
me
of
bauhaus
brewery
a
brewery
in
minnesota
that
makes
similarly
exceptional
hoppyish
lager
beers
warming
up
the
beer
still
im
not
getting
the
familiar
smells
and
flavors
im
used
to
getting
with
the
citra
hop
after
warming
it
up
some
the
smellflavor
is
pretty
similar
for
me
as
my
latter
experience
the
other
thing
i
do
like
is
the
abv
is
at
7
never
would
have
guessed
it
after
sampling
it
still
waiting
for
that
lager
that
really
brings
home
the
name
hoppy
lager
this
is
great
for
the
lager
realm
but
some
day
i
want
to
be
punched
in
the
nose
with
american
hop
aroma
and
then
subsequently
the
mouth
with
the
same
experience
along
with
a
clean
taste
the
comes
with
a
lager
all
in
all
great
lager
i
lover
the
bitterness
of
it
wish
it
came
through
with
that
familiar
american
hop
aromaflavor
even
though
i
think
it
as
all
american
hops
but
yet
still
reminds
mefor
some
reasonof
european
pilsnerslagers
is
it
just
me
or
o
not
bad
but
by
no
means
my
favorite
picked
up
a
couple
of
singles
at
the
sunoco
craft
beer
exchange
glad
to
see
that
i
could
sample
this
before
committing
to
the
12pack
i
ran
across
at
the
grocery
store
the
other
day
after
chilling
at
home
for
an
hour
i
filled
an
ipa
tulip
with
a
measured
pour
the
honey
golden
lagers
exceptional
clarity
highlights
the
lively
carbonation
as
sodalike
bubbles
stream
to
the
surface
a
frothy
white
layer
of
foam
gives
the
impression
of
a
styrofoam
puck
excellent
quality
lacing
clings
to
the
glass
without
the
carbonation
i
might
mistake
this
for
apple
juice
from
concentrate
theres
a
nice
bright
hoppy
fragrance
dank
with
an
earthy
smell
that
obscures
the
typical
pale
lager
aroma
plenty
of
sweet
tropical
scents
round
out
the
complex
and
aromatic
nose
the
first
sip
yields
a
crackerlike
malt
flavor
that
compliments
the
citrus
sweetness
dry
in
the
finish
with
mild
bitterness
of
grapefruit
pith
and
pine
considerably
sweeter
than
any
other
pale
lager
that
comes
to
mind
the
7
abv
is
well
hidden
by
the
lingering
hop
qualities
though
a
boozy
breath
develops
by
midbeer
the
mouthfeel
is
juicy
with
zesty
carbonation
by
far
the
best
ipl
ive
had
to
date
however
generally
speaking
the
style
is
simply
not
my
cup
of
tea
the
2
styles
that
come
together
here
are
just
not
entirely
compatible
in
my
opinion
not
to
the
extent
that
they
can
ever
rival
the
finest
standalone
lagers
or
ipas
anyhow
id
take
sierra
nevadas
summer
lager
or
any
number
of
their
ipas
over
this
that
said
its
a
superhopped
big
blonde
lager
exactly
as
advertised
and
its
great
overall
i
expected
this
to
be
hoppier
given
the
name
and
was
pleasantly
surprised
that
the
honeylike
malts
stole
the
show
this
is
a
beer
i
didnt
know
i
needed
sierra

is
knocking
it

of
the

is

love
the
mixed
style
here
hopefully
it
becomes
more
than
a
single
season
beer
overall
a
pretty
good
lager
and
worth
getting
again
the
beer
is
fairly
drinkable
but
is
better
suited
for
warmer
weather
well
i
know
now
and
im
definitely
interested
in
exploring
more
beers
like
this
the
light
color
says
lager
and
the
smell
doesnt
suggest
ample
hops
but
as
promised
by
the
name
its
nicely
hopped
it
goes
down
easily
not
loving
the
finish
but
its
still
tasty
certainly
worth
trying
rjt
i
admittedly
did
not
have
real
high
expectations
for
this
when
i
grabbed
a
single
to
try
it
out
i
promptly
went
back
for
a
6pack
the
next
day
just
an
extremely
solid
allaround
beer
that
drinks
smooth
like
a
lager
but
packs
big
hop
flavorswithout
the
extreme
bitterness
i
really
hope
this
finds
its
way
into
yearround
production
because
this
feels
like
an
ideal
summer
beer
overall
great
beer
for
what
it
it
is
better
than
most
but
not
as
good
as
the
outstanding
ones
which
gives
it
points
in
my
opinion
for
the
money
you
cannot
find
a
better
beer
at
a
better
price

overall

excellent
beer
i
had
a
few
favorites
from
the
beer
camp
experiment
and
this
was
one
of
them
glad
to
see
it
back
and
i
highly
recommend
it
o
a
very
nice
and
drinkable
ipl
that
definitely
focuses
on
the
hops
the
malt
provides
a
nice
backing
while
still
allowing
the
hops
the
shine
definitely
worth
checking
out
as
it
is
a
bit
different
than
the
electric
ray
that
they
put
out
with
ballast
point
pours
orange
and
golden
with
a
slight
haze
and
a
creamy
head
of
white
foam
nose
is
very
citrusy
has
plenty
of
bright
peel
and
tangy
fruit
on
it
its
got
an
earthiness
to
the
nose
and
a
bit
of
spice
theres
touch
of
some
kind
of
fruit
rind
and
a
bit
of
musk
on
the
nose
the
malt
seems
neutral
and
not
very
sweet
in
the
drink
he
malt
is
crackery
and
soft
the
fruit
flavor
and
hop
bitter
never
comes
up
to
ipa
strength
and
the
earhty
softness
of
the
beer
keeps
the
palate
from
getting
fatigued
by
either
the
alcohol
or
the
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
medium
its
darn
good
i
like
it
because
its
mild
on
the
hops
and
they
seem
to
blend
in
so
well
in
this
beer
more
breaddy
than
bitter
in
the
finish
without
too
much
sweetness
this
one
is
pretty
easy
to
drink
and
either
i
am
getting
used
to
the
style
or
i
really
did
like
this
one
surprisingly
smooth
yet
bitter
excellent
beer
super
drinkability
may
have
to
buy
some
more
of
this
o
this
one
drinks
like
a
light
version
jacks
abby
kiwi
rising
definitely
not
as
hoppy
or
as
hefty
just
a
good
clean
but
flavorful
beer
with
a
good
mix
of
hoppiness
bitterness
and
malt
backing
great
job
by
sn
on
this
beer
i
hope
it
becomes
a
yearly
seasonal
as
i
could
see
myself
going
through
a
case
or
so
of
this
every
year
i
dont
go
after
sn
celebration
much
anymore
but
this
could
take
its
place
in
the
rotation
o
overall
this
is
a
damn
refreshing
brew
with
some
excellent
hop
aroma
im
pretty
impressed
with
this
one
they
must
have
really
liked
this
one
a
lot
to
put
it
out
on
is
own
usually
these
are
in
a
mixed
box
so
somebody
was
stoked
on
it
i
liked
it
quite
well
actually
it
is
as
advertised
very
hoppy
which
i
think
helps
me
get
past
the
general
blandness
of
the
malt
profile
on
it
the
hops
are
really
robust
and
fresh
and
citrusy
a
cool
fit
for
a
style
that
just
doesnt
usually
see
enough
hops
beer
is
super
light
in
color
but
quite
strong
for
what
it
is
you
can
really
feel
the
buzz
after
a
bunch
of
this
i
like
the
beer
camp
series
and
hope
to
see
more
of
them
this
year
curious
sweetness
in
here
is
a
little
out
of
place
for
me
but
big
carbonation
helps
keep
it
light
enough
not
amazing
but
pretty
good
i
would
definitely
drink
this
again
seems
more
like
a
summer
thing
to
me
than
a
winter
one
though
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
but
this
was
really
good
nice
balance
i
could
easily
hammer
quite
a
few
on
a
hot
summers
day
goes
down
effortlessly
and
could
be
dangerous
at
a
picnic
or
bbq
well
done
not
your
average
pils
and
it
sure
doesnt
look
and
taste
like
they
were
trying
to
be
either
way
it
is
one
excellent
beer
overall
a
decent
brew
but
just
not
enough
going
on
for
me
not
really
a
lager
fan
happy
to
have
had
a
chance
to
try
it
though
i
like
this
beer
it
was
very
good
the
one
thing
i
didnt
like
was
the
aroma
pours
a
sparkling
clear
golden
honey
with
a
light
white
teo
finger
head
aroma
is
hops
and
citrus
taste
follows
with
hops
citrus
bitterness
all
balanced
by
bready
biscuit
like
malt
mouthfeel
is
medium
but
goes
down
smooth
overall
a
nice
beer
and
a
unique
twist
on
the
traditional
lager
i
definitely
see
both
sierra
nevada
and
balast
point
in
this
beer
a
collaboration
i
wouldnt
mind
seeing
more
of
i
would
have
hoped
with
the
word
hoppy
in
the
name
that
it
would
be
a
bit
more
hoppy
what
is
there
adds
a
nice
accent
and
pours
a
deep
golden
color
with
very
active
light
colored
head
aroma
is
that
of
very
fresh
hops
and
citrus
taste
is
very
refreshing
nice
strong
hops
and
grapefruit
its
spicy
and
finishes
slightly
bitter
feels
light
and
airy
well
carbonated
and
best
consumed
nice
and
cold
overall
a
very
crisp
refreshing
entry
from
sn
i
really
like
this
one
o
this
is
good
and
it
grows
on
you
just
what
it
says
on
the
tin
a
bright
clean
crisp
and
very
hoppy
lager
excellent
delicious
drink
it
now
i
would
suggest
overall
very
enjoyable
and
id
place
in
the
session
hoppy
alelager
category
clean
crisp
and
with
nice
hop
aroma
and
flavor
good
balance
would
buy
again
this
is
not
a
good
beer
smells
terrible
tastes
slightly
better
feel
is
fine
the
look
is
the
best
thing
about
it
this
is
one
of
the
better
pilsners
ive
had
but
im
not
sure
where
the
hoppy
comes
in
that
might
just
be
me
and
my
hopstruck
palate
though
solid
pilsner
that
doesnt
come
across
as
7
in
any
way
mouthfeel
was
light
and
smooth
with
a
medium
body
and
just
below
average
carbonation
not
sure
its
worthy
of
imperial
but
its
a
solid
pilsner
and
way
above
average

d
really
love
this
beer
ive
bought
3
sixers
of
this
so
far
this
is
the
type
of
beer
that
you
can
drink
all
night
o
overall
this
is
a
decent
hoppy
lager
has
the
very
distinct
sierra
nevada
yeast
and
flavor
with
tons
of
hoppy
overtones
definitely
will
revisit
this
beer
for
an
easy
drinking
hoppy
flavorful
option
only
thing
giving
this
a
lower
score
is
the
smell
pretty
awful
and
the
fact
that
ive
had
a
ton
of
jacks
abby
beers
that
blow
this
out
of
the
water
ja
sets
the
bar
for
hoppy
lagers
for
me
pilsner
malt
balanced
bitterness
smooth
grapefruit
grassy
hazy
honey
like
appearance
floral
nose
with
very
smooth
mouth
feel
with
crisp
finish
taste
of
citrus
lemongrass
zest
with
just
the
right
amount
of
hops
bitterness
without
being
overwhelming
another
great
notch
in
the
belt
for
sierra
nevada
serving
type
bottle
not
my
thing
skunky
and
tastes
a
little
like
dish
soap
didnt
give
it
lower
ratings
because
i
like
sierra
nevada
golden
and
perfect
body
and
color
for
a
lager
short
quick
fading
head
barely
reaches
an
inch
and
becomes
a
skim
just
as
quick
nose
really
lets
the
lager
feel
shine
a
bit
of
german
feel
meets
soft
hop
notes
enters
the
mouth
with
a
champagne
like
feel
hops
add
a
second
level
of
nice
bitter
dryness
to
the
backside
of
the
palate
nicely
clean
on
the
finish
and
super
refreshing
and
drinkable
a
solid
brew
as
a
resident
of
chico
i
feel
blessed
to
have
such
a
phenomenal
brewery
within
walking
distance
but
i
feel
like
this
one
falls
short
of
their
comparable
ballast
point
collaboration
where
the
beer
camp
brew
was
slightly
sharper
and
brighter
this
seems
light
ipl
with
the
volume
turned
down
maltier
with
a
sufficiently
satisfying
mouthfeel
still
delicious
just
didnt
meet
my
high
expectations
when
compared
to
electric
ray
the
first
bottle
tasted
very
boozy
and
hop
heavy
after
tasting
the
next
day
really
enjoyed
the
lager
front
hop
back
flavors
grab
yourself
some
and
enjoy
but
not
stopping
there
the
hops
billow
into
lemon
grass
and
peppercorn
as
the
malt
fade
gracefully
from
contention
and
its
grassy
bitterness
closes
the
taste
the
medium
bodied
lager
trails
with
soft
tea
and
lemongrass
begging
for
thai
cuisine
just
doesnt
mesh
well
to
me
with
the
lager
the
finish
has
no
bite
this
is
a
good
beer
for
style
just
not
overall
2
765
not
quite
the
beer
equivalent
of
dawn
but
not
far
off
sooooo
fing
good
better
than
the
origanal
o
the
grain
fades
as
this
one
warms
allowing
the
soft
pilsner
backbone
to
harmonize
with
the
fruity
hops
flavorful
and
unique
mouthfeel
is
good
theres
a
fairly
light
body
to
it
even
though
it
has
a
pretty
solid
lingering
flavor
carbonation
is
spot
on
has
some
good
initial
sweetness
with
a
buttery
feel
towards
the
back
end
but
still
has
a
clean
traditional
lager
finish
that
isnt
quite
as
crisp
as
i
expected
but
close
enough
good
drinkability
its
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
and
the
7
abv
is
well
hidden
i
expected
it
to
be
less
i
was
surprised
when
insane
the
label
really
good
beer
overall
not
the
best
ipl
ive
had
but
worthy
of
being
in
the
conversation
very
good
lager
but
the
hops
arent
complex
enough
the
malt
backbone
not
strong
enough
for
the
7
abv
be
careful
it
is
highly
drinkable
and
will
get
you
drunk
in
a
hurry
pours
a
clear
golden
with
light
amber
tones
the
lace
is
super
sticky
and
it
has
the
look
of
a
patchy
adolescent
beard
there
is
no
beauty
to
it
really
the
nose
is
straight
lager
straw
and
bread
dough
taste
piney
most
of
all
with
some
citrus
notes
mixed
in
a
nice
extra
bitterness
is
perfect
this
is
highly
drinkable
and
would
be
nice
if
it
wasnt
a
one
time
thing

b
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
how
much
i
enjoyed
this
smooth
balanced
citrus
and
light
fruit
upfront
balanced
by
smooth
malt
in
the
background
finishes
very
clean
the
verdict
good
beer
well
balanced
with
plenty
of
flavor
this
beer
is
exactly
what
you
would
expect
having
had
a
couple
hoppy
lagers
before
its
more
subdued
then
a
hoponius
or
citra
mantra
which
is
good
the
crisp
mouthfeel
is
there
but
not
quite
as
clean
as
i
would
like
drinks
like
a
5er
quite
easy
to
overdo
it
on
this
one
overall
a
true
imperial
pilsner
bordering
on
hellesmaibock
territory
i
am
amazed
at
what
a
prominent
role
the
robust
malts
play
in
this
beer
very
delicious
o
i
havent
tried
many
offerings
from
sierra
nevada
but
i
have
enjoyed
all
of
the
ones
that
i
have
this
is
no
exception
very
good
very
enjoyable
and
well
balanced
i
loved
this
beer
im
a
big
fan
on
ipas
and
was
recommended
to
try
this
beer
nice
and
hoppy
but
not
over
powering
the
aroma
consisted
largely
of
hops
i
would
drink
this
beer
all
day
great
work
by
sierra
nevada
clear
body
was
golden
in
color
and
had
a
lively
enough
carbonation
to
form
a
craggy
two
finger
thick
head
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
very
citric
evoking
mostly
grapefruit
the
taste
was
clear
crisp
and
smooth
like
a
lager
should
be
but
unlike
a
typical
lager
there
was
a
citric
american
hop
presence
mid
palette
onward
the
bitterness
was
not
that
strong
up
front
but
as
the
beer
lingered
on
the
tongue
it
became
more
and
more
apparent
very
soft
feel
and
very
well
hidden
alcohol
made
this
a
classy
yet
approachable
offering
sierra
nevada
just
keep
up
to
their
usual
standards
of
excellence
here
very
drinkable
ipl
im
surprised
at
the
7
abv
i
love
ipas
but
i
wholeheartedly
dislike
this
ipl
and
most
ipls
come
to
think
of
it
good
lager
for
people
who
enjoy
hops
a
very
well
done
pilsner
something
i
will
certainly
enjoy
having
a
6
pack
of
really
interesting
take
on
a
ipl
similar
but
boozier
than
the
nooner
pilsner
but
really
good
very
piney
and
flavorful
the
lager
qualities
shine
through
though
very
aggressive
for
a
spring
seasonal
but
would
love
this
to
be
year
round
well
done
overall
this
is
a
big
beer
and
reminds
me
a
good
deal
of
sns
torpedo
ipa
flavor
wise
the
7
abv
is
slightly
tasted
but
not
intrusive
an
excellent
beer
and
well
recommended
my
bottle
was
barely
a
month
old
pours
and
looks
like
a
lager
aroma
is
like
a
lagerbud
lite
except
it
has
the
fine
additional
aroma
of
hops
taste
is
slightly
like
a
lager
but
with
a
big
bitter
dose
of
hops
nice
some
citrus
and
overall
a
great
balanced
lager
bold
and
enjoyable
hardly
even
notice
the
7
abv
another
enjoyable
offering
from
sierra
nevada
has
a
pleasant
skunky
aroma
and
flavor
going
on
that
i
actually
kind
of
like
if
i
didnt
know
better
i
suspect
its
on
purpose
i
like
this
beer
i
always
feel
obligated
to
buy
s
n
wth
good
reason
clear
gorgeous
golden
hue
with
a
12
finger
of
white
head
that
quickly
disappeared
pretty
big
aromas
lemon
and
lemon
zest
a
bit
of
a
floral
note
and
the
ubiquitous
sn
clean
smell
hard
to
explain
but
you
know
what
i
mean
a
bit
different
from
some
of
their
other
hoppy
beers
as
there
is
a
bit
of
a
yeasty
note
there
too
smooth
midpalate
of
smooth
malt
bitter
on
the
end
nice
lemonycitrusy
flavors
as
well
balanced
if
a
bit
on
the
bitter
side
really
clean
and
refreshing
crisp
my
only
real
complaint
is
the
timing
this
would
be
the
definition
of
a
julyaugust
lawnmower
beer
for
me
dont
think
ill
hold
on
to
any
quite
that
long
though
sierra
holds
up
pretty
well
abbreviated
review
has
a
really
strange
taste
to
it
perhaps
a
tainted
bottle
flavor
is
clean
and
lagery
with
muted
citrus
and
biscuity
malt
finish
is
piney
and
fairly
bitter
beer
camp
is
designed
to
introduce
us
to
different
and
odd
mixtures
of
beer
styles
and
they
have
done
a
very
good
job
with
this
this
tastes
just
like
hoponious
union
with
a
smidge
less
something
in
the
hops
and
a
bit
more
malty
sweetness
in
other
words
its
really
good
the
hops
are
large
and
mighty
and
bam
so
is
the
maltiness
the
finish
is
really
clean
hu
is
a
beer
i
cant
chug
but
this
for
some
reason
i
could
guzzle
if
you
cant
get
hoponious
enjoy
this
while
it
lasts
its
a
winner
big
time
o
im
kicking
myself
for
only
getting
a
single
bottle
however
i
could
always
get
more
if
needed
im
really
digging
this
one
uniquely
light
for
a
7
not
bad
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
that
is
easy
to
drink
it
gives
excitement
and
complexity
but
avoids
overdoing
any
of
it
maybe
the
best
beer
ive
had
in
months
try
it
before
its
gone
great
deal
for

at

that

taste
is
really
dialed
in
nicely
smooth
smooth
smooth
and
creamy
with
a

that
fades
to

minimal
aftertaste
usually
i
have
never
been
a
fan
of
higher
octane
pilsners
but
this
one
defintely
seems
to
work
for
me
the
mouthfeel
was
crisp
and
clean
no
complaints
there
i
guess
im
just
waiting
to
try
an
ipl
with
dipa
level
hops
overall
it
leaves
a
bit
to
be
desired
value
in
the
price
for
a
six

makes
it
worth

in

tried
a

because
the
first
didnt
leave
me
with
a
good
impression
served
at
a
warmer
temperature
the
offflavors
were
much
less
prominent
and
the
hops
were
able
to
shine
through
taste

increased
from

still
would
not
consider
good

alternatives
first
beer
camp
i
have
tried
really
enjoyed
looking
forward
to
the
hop
hunter
solid
beer
what
i
would
expect
from
a
beer
called
a
hoppy
lager
getting
more
traditional
pilsner
than
ipa
nothing
special
but
its
a
decent
everyday
drinking
beer
overall
a
good
brew
though
personally
its
not
quite
doing
it
for
me
maybe
its
just
a
bit
too
grainy
for
my
liking
perhaps
itd
be
best
for
me
to
drink
it
fast
and
not
take
my
time
by
putting
it
under
a
review
microscope
i
enjoyed
the
others
from
the
6pack
considerably
more
regardless
looks
like
a
oneoff
release
so
its
unlikely
ill
be
drinking
it
again
great
job
this
is
a
hopped
up
lager
but
not
like
humulus
lager
or
other
danky
lagers
that
taste
like
ipas
if
you
enjoy
crisp
beer
give
this
a
try
this
is
a
great
beer
get
it
now
because
you
wont
see
it
again
best
hop
lager
ive
had
this
is
a
great
beer
nice
release
very
sessionable
good
hop
notes
and
a
slight
sweet
taste
well
done
o
this
would
be
a
superb
spring
offering
if
it
were
indeed
early
april
but
while
this
does
say
spring
seasonal
2015
it
was
brewed
in
december
and
arrived
first
week
of
january
oh
yea
the
predictions
still
a
darn
good
hopped
up
lager
worth
a
go
for
certain
sierra
nevada
beer
camp
yes
please
ballast
point
at
this
beer
camp
concocting
some
sort
of
hoppy
lager
pour
me
at
glass
one
aside
thank
you
whoever
it
was
at
sierra
nevada
that
managed
to
beat
the
everything
hoppy
is
an
india
x
it
must
have
taken
a
pretty
strong
minded
individual
to
subdue
the
marketing
wonks
at
the
brewery
and
call
it
just
what
it
is
a
hoppy
lager
now
if
we
could
just
get
everyone
else
on
board
maybe
india
pale
lager
will
just
die
its
deserved
death
followed
by
black
ipa
too
this
looks
clean
and
crisp
smell
is
of
faint
floral
and
citrus
hops
i
havent
had
too
many
lagers
i
do
love
great
lakes
dortmunder
though
but
i
have
had
quite
a
few
ipas
and
i
think
this
is
a
solid
brew
its
crisp
and
refreshing
like
a
lager
but
it
has
a
hop
bite
of
an
ipa
its
well
balanced
with
mainly
floral
hops
and
hints
of
pine
and
citrus
hops
all
over
a
nice
malt
backbone
i
think
this
beer
nails
the
style
its
dangerously
drinkable
and
id
love
to
throw
back
a
sixer
by
the
pool
this
poured
really
light
so
i
was
thinking
here
is
another
sy
lager
but
is
was
really
good
just
the
right
amount
of
hops
to
keep
me
drinking
this
one
i
have
liked
every
beer
i
have
tried
from
sierra
nevada
but
this
one
i
just
couldnt
finish
whatever
hops
were
used
one
of
them
i
didnt
like
at
all
it
seemed
kind
of
dank
almost
skunky
my
friend
liked
it
so
im
sure
its
just
me
but
i
wanted
to
give
my
rating
anyhow
wont
try
again
o
refreshing
the
dry
finish
makes
you
want
another
sip
o
enjoyable
and
slightly
better
than
the
ballast
point
collaboration
version
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
without
a
lot
of
sweetness
alcohol
is
well
hidden
underrated
for
sure
might
have
slightly
tweaked
this
seasonal
batch
from
original
one
reviews
seem
much
higher
crystal
clear
shining
gold
color
with
a
substantial
head
of
offwhite
froth
that
lasts
for
quite
awhile
peppery
leafy
oily
hop
aroma
with
floral
peach
grassy
and
crackerlike
notes
clean
herbal
spicy
hop
bitterness
on
a
subtle
pale
malt
sweetness
orange
blossoms
and
honey
medium
bodied
and
somewhat
silky
feeling
with
fine
lively
carbonation
that
compliments
the
hoppiness
well
the
result
is
similar
to
some
of
the
harvest
series
beers
from
this
year
a
quality
strong
lager
that
avoids
any
overbearing
sweetness
nicely
done
i
honestly
dont
think
i
have
a
great
palate
and
have
a
difficult
time
identifying
some
of
the
flavors
i
find
in
beer
on
the
other
hand
i
seem
to
have
quite
a
gift
for
comparing
similar
beers
this
one
hit
me
about
an
hour
after
i
tried
it
founders
all
day
ipa
which
i
have
not
had
since
last
summer
i
know
one
is
an
ale
and
the
other
a
lager
but
try
a
taste
test
a
see
if
i
nailed
it
or
not
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
beer
its
definitely
different
than
any
other
beer
out
these
so
its
mostly
a
matter
of
preference
pours
crystal
clear
as
a
lager
should
be
but
without
much
head
smells
just
like
a
fresh
noble
hop
its
magical
light
and
crisp
mouthfeel
tastes
like
a
lager
but
with
more
noble
hops
not
much
added
bitterness
which
is
great
o
something
is
just
off
to
me
i
dont
know
what
it
is
but
it
just
seems
a
bit
weird
to
me
o
a
well
done
ipl
for
sure
goes
down
very
easily
this
one
is
good
o
delicious
its
perfect

best
hoppy
lager
from
a
brewery
not

abby
well
after

camp

camp
beer
camp
i
stroll
the
aisles
of
the
local
big
box
and
low
and
behold
beer
camp
lets
give
it
a
whirl
popping
the
topn
i
get
a
piney
citrusy
waft
of
hops
on
the
pour
into
the
trusty
sapp
that
i
believe
is
really
only
14oz
i
get
a
bright
yellow
brew
with
a
yellow
tinged
big
bubble
head
that
stands
strong
and
laces
as
is
slowly
recedes
on
the
taste
this
brew
has
a
balanced
yet
complex
flavor
that
bounces
between
a
dandelion
bitterness
and
a
tarty
sweet
maltiness
as
it
states
on
the
bottler
it
is
indeed
crispy
throughout
and
leaves
a
slightly
bitter
sticky
aftertaste
leaving
one
yearning
for
more
another
keeper
from
snb
that
never
fails
to
please
notice
that
they
now
brew
in
mills
river
nc
good
to
know
as
it
makes
sn
even
more
accessible
taste
very
wellhopped
yet
light
in
body
as
a
lager
theres
a
swell
of
bitter
citrus
hops
up
front
followed
by
a
mellow
and
malty
finish
to
round
things
off
a
superlative
ipl
and
another
winner
from
sierra

who
it
seems
can
do
no

a

and
a

style
that
i
dont
come
across
much
nice
change
of
pace
from
all
of
the
heavy
winter
brews
out
right
now
this
version
is
definitely
more
balanced
and
better
than
the
initial
summer
premiere
just
a
great
surprise
especially
after
not
being
overwhelmed
by
their
contribution
to
the
12
pack
this
summer
a
pleasant
if
not
overwhelming
hop
bomb
esque
aroma
but
bolstered
by
a
greati
guess
i
have
to
go
with
mouthfeel
a
fullness
thats
hard
to
describe
for
me
anyway
delicious
not
sure
if
my
bottle
was
infected
but
this
just
smells
and
tastes
off
no
where
near
as
good
as
the
version
from
the
beer
camp
multi
pack
just
right
not
overpowering
in
either
direction
the
best
of
both
worlds
wow
what
a
crisp
lager
this
one
is
clear
straw
color
one
finger
foam
with
nice
lacing
holding
on
thruout
the
session
very
citrusy
with
hop
taste
and
lager
crispness
coming
thru
at
different
times
little
high
in
the
abv
dept
but
very
well
hidden
will
buy
again
fruity
nose
crisp
and
clean
lager
very
drinkable
this
is
easy
to
drink
and
full
of
flavor
you
get
the
best
of
both
worlds
you
get
great
tropical
fruit
notes
along
with
the
breadycorn
malt
feel
from
a
pilsner
overall
a
really
good
take
on
the
india

pretty
nice
not
quite
electric

which
was
one
of
the
better
beer
camp
across
america
offerings
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
nice
beer
and
i
thought
it
was
a
nice
example
of
a
hoppy
lager
i
dont
find
it
to
be
a
standout
example
of
the
style
but
as
far
as
hoppy
lagers
go
its
pretty
true
to
style
and
i
thought
the
creamy
aspect
was
a
nice
and
slightly
unique
touch
this
beer
had
nice
drinkability
it
was
smooth
fairly
crisp
pretty
creamy
not
too
filling
and
the
taste
did
an
ok
job
at
holding
my
attention
i
wouldnt
have
any
trouble
drinking
a
couple
of
these
especially
in
the
summertime
but
anymore
than
that
and
i
know
i
would
start
to
get
bored
with
it
what
i
like
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
balance
between
the
malts
and
the
hops
it
was
just
where
i
want
it
to
be
for
a
hoppy
lager
what
i
like
the
least
about
this
beer
was
the
hop
profile
it
was
ok
but
it
started
to
wear
on
me
after
a
little
while
and
i
think
they
could
make
it
a
little
more
brighter
and
interesting
i
might
buy
this
beer
again
when
im
in
the
mood
for
the
style
and
i
for
sure
wouldnt
turn
one
down
i
would
recommend
it
if
you
like
the
style
but
i
dont
think
its
a
stand
out
example
of
the
style
all
in
all
i
liked
this
beer
but
i
didnt
love
it
i
think
with
a
little
work
on
the
hop
profile
this
could
be
a
very
nice
hoppy
lager
and
i
think
they
are
mostly
on
the
right
track
when
it
comes
to
the
style
its
not
my
favorite
sierra
nevada
beer
and
i
would
say
its
above
average
for
the
style
nice
job
guys
this
was
a
solid
hoppy
lager
keep
up
the
solid
work
decent
hoppy
lager
not
over
powering
on
the
hops
final
thoughts
i
like
this
one
as
a
oneoff
beer
it
was
a
nice
proof
of
concept
but
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
past
the
first
sixpack
would
i
drink
it
again
maybe
overall
a
wellexecuted
hop
forward
lager
im
enjoying
the
tropical
fruit
flavors
and
aromas
present
in
the
beer
slightly
more
drinkable
than
the
original
recipe
the
electric
ray
from
beer
camp
across
america
im
looking
forward
to
seeing
this
in
6
packs
4
5
this
is
a
terrific
imperial
pilsner
and
i
grab
one
nearly
everytime
i
see
it
on
the
store
shelf
my
inlaws
always
like
to
bring
me
new
beer
from
their
travels
and
this
one
is
from
one
of
their
trips
to
nyc
it
pours
from
the
bottle
with
a
cloudy
muted
orangeyellow
color
and
is
topped
by
a
giant
dense
foamy
head
the
aroma
has
a
decent
yeast
presence
some
dull
earthyleafy
hops
a
little
bit
of
bready
sweetness
and
a
tiny
hint
of
alcohol
the
flavor
has
a
nice
contrast
of
dense
woodsy
bitterness
against
a
chewy
yeasty
breadiness
the
light
carbonation
allows
a
mouthfilling
resinous
texture
to
develop
overall
this
one
is
a
bit
hefty
with
a
rustic
and
bold
flavor
profile
that
is
quite
satisfying
hopped
up
heineken
with
belgiany

on

at
novare
res
many
thanks
for
securing
the
keg
more
grassy

than
the
dfh
version

offwhite
persistent

noble

spice

are
more
noticeable
in
the
head
then
in
the
body
while
the
rich
moravian
malts
shine
more
brightly
in
the
body
but
the
two
blend
in
the
mouth
giving
the
beer
an
enjoyable
parfait
quality
the
beer
has
big
malt
and
hops
but
everything
is
perfectly
balanced
medium
body
and
very
fine
soft
carbonation
i
like
this
one
better
then
the
american
brewed
version
overall
wow
this
is
a
year
old
and
still
has
a
lot
of
the
hop
character
the
nose
has
really
dulled
out
but
the
flavor
is
still
strong
im
impressed
it
held
up
this
well
a
very
pleasant
surprise
as
i
usually
don
not
favour
double
pils
brews
8
88
for
the
11
1
ounce
fancy
assed
bottles
is
a
bit
much
though
o
a
big
approach
to
a
pilsner
the
hop
profile
is
dense
and
only
one
part
of
a
very
complex
and
very
enjoyable
beer
a
very
full
flavoured
and
unique
brew
full
of
rich
fruity
flavours
very
enjoyable
unique
and
refreshing
hard
to
fault
and
well
balanced
food
match
this
is
a
brew
that
would
feel
at
home
with
a
thai
noodle
salad
or
light
bbq
fare
grilled
chicken
sausages
minute
steaks
potato
salad
and
coleslaw
a
veritable
everymeal
beer
overall
very
drinkable
creamy
brew
o
amazing
pilsner
only
one
ive
had
that
i
like
more
is
humulus
by
the
bruery
and
its
very
close
a
nice
beer
with
a
good
malt
and
citrus
base
some
pleasant
fruits
and
a
good
balance
between
flavours
the
alcohol
content
was
very
well
hidden
and
the
beer
was
a
good
highly
drinkable
one
overall
this
is
the
first
dogfish
head
collaboration
beer
i
have
ever
had
and
it
doesnt
disappoint
plenty
of
citrus
hops
and
tropical
fruits
with
spice
and
malt
i
still
dont
think
its
worth
au120
a
case
of
24
x
330ml
but
one
every
now
and
then
definitely
wont
hurt
t
impressive
beer
that
is
recommended
overall
tastes
like
a
slightly
old
60minute
ipa
but
with
the
spicy
lemon
hop
bill
of
a
pils
not
refreshing
enough
nor
flavorful
enough
it
pours
clear
light
amber
with
a
creamy
white
foam
aroma
has
lots
of
floral
hops
with
pine
and
grass
the
hop
aroma
is
sharp
and
a
reminder
that
this
beer
is
continuosly
hopped
the
first
thing
that
hits
when
tasting
is
the
agressive
hops
the
body
is
light
to
medium
and
despite
the
hops
it
is
easy
to
drink
over
all
an
enjoyable
experience

d
solid
all
around
tasty
beer
worth
a
try
o
well
made
beer
and
quite
drinkable
even
if
not
my
preferred
style
probably
the
best
beer
of
this
style
ive
had
wish
it
were
cheaper
super
drinkabiity
overall
its
a
nice
imperial
pilsner
nice
floral
notes
and
pale
malt
sweetness
with
a
fruity
finish
d
great
balanced
and
hoppy
imperial
pilsner
o
very
interesting
beer
definitely
an
americanized
pilsner
quite
hoppy
but
its
not
anything
approaching
your
average
big
name
ipa
or
even
apa
its
just
hoppy
for
a
pilsner
the
smoothness
of
flavors
and
their
great
integration
really
sets
this
beer
apart
in
my
opinion
all
lot
of
pilsners
are
super
sharp
and
crisp
to
the
point
of
their
detriment
sometimes
great
work
on
this
one
o
both
my
buddy
and
i
were
very
impressed
by
this
beer
it
is
unique
without
trying
too
hard
and
good
enough
to
want
again
kind
of
pedestrian
but
fairly
pleasant
and
enjoyable
flavours
maybe
a
good
bridging
beer
for
more
extreme
flavours
picked
up
a
375ml
never
seen
it
in
this
size
dark
hazy
brown
almost
looks
like
a
belgian
strong
along
with
the
same
requisite
rocky
off
white
cap
dont
remember
it
being
this
dark
very
nice
head
that
sticks
around
for
the
duration
also
to
note
this
bottle
let
out
a
very
loud
hiss
when
opened
nose
opens
with
bright
citrus
and
biscuity
malts
alcohol
phenols
corn
husk
and
some
vegetalness
intriguing
for
a
imp
pils
mouth
hits
right
away
with
gushing
carbonation
and
brings
corn
flakes
corn
fields
reminds
me
of
frshly
tilled
land
a
bit
of
greeniness
dry
malts
and
a
twinge
of
hop
bitterness
only
bitter
no
flavor
from
them
and
finishes
with
bitter
belgian
spices
refreshing
and
the
carbonation
does
well
to
wipe
away
the
flavor
and
nose
to
prepare
you
for
the
next
sip
i
actually
prefer
this
to
the
dfh
version
which
seems
lighter
in
color
doesnt
matter
does
have
an
almost
astrigent
alcohol
taste
the
bdb
version
seems
to
be
better
intergrated
and
a
well
made
beer
regardless
of
which
brewey
it
comes
from
o
overall
a
good
beer
but
not
something
id
seek
out
due
to
the
vegetal
qualities
taste
is
very
bitterspicy
maybe
pepper
papaya
oranges
herbal
notes
and
simply
a
hop
beast
dry
and
bitter
finish
this
is
a
great
beer
overall
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
at
all
in
fact
i
think
it
is
the
best
pilsner
i
have
had
thus
far
love
the
fact
that
the
bubbles
keep
on
and
keep
on
bought
a
bottle
of
this
from
harvest
wine
spirits
in
west
hartford
ct
poured
into
a
pilsner
glass
orangeamber
semicloudy
brew
with
an
amazingly
thick
creamy
head
that
lasted
the
length
of
the
drinks
life
receding
into
a
petridish
style
head
at
the
end
the
hoppy
citrusy
notes
coming
off
this
smell
are
amazing
with
a
taste
that
just
blew
my
mind
completely
changing
my
definition
of
what
i
thought
a
pilsner
was
the
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
acidic
in
the
late
late
aftertaste
but
other
than
that
i
cant
find
a
single
flaw
in
this
beer
loved
it
loved
it
and
would
absolutely
recommend
it
longer
explanation
short
its
balanced
for
what
it
is
just
not
dazzling
less
would
be
more
o
very
crisp
and
clean
complex
for
a
pilsner
and
a
very
nice
hop
flavor
i
dig
it
i
wish
i
knew
more
about
this
birra
del
borgo
i
know
to
trust
dogfish
head
and
know
ive
got
a
new
italian
brewery
to
look
out
for
this
is
definitely
worth
checking
out
for
those
who
are
bored
with
the
sameold
usual
lineup
of
approaches
to
pilsner
its
different
enough
to
be
interesting
and
novel
but
not
so
different
as
to
be
unapproachable
o
i
rated
the
dfh
version
quite
high
this
is
way
up
there
as
well
this
is
spectacular
really
glad
i
bought
the
bigger
bottle
and
spent
the
extra
money
the
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
fluffy
tan
head
that
laces
there
is
no
sediment
but
a
slight
haziness
the
nose
is
a
fierce
competition
between
candi
sugar
and
piney
hops
very
interesting
for
a
double
pils
the
taste
is
more
similar
to
a
belgian
strong
than
a
double
pilsner
im
quite
confused
and
let
down
the
mouthfeel
really
seals
the
belgian
strong
ale
deal
with
a
potent
palatecoating
sweetness
biting
alcohol
yeast
and
resinous
hops
there
is
nothing
light
and
refreshing
about
this
beer
i
will
not
try
this
beer
again
and
dont
know
why
i
bothered
carbonation
could
be
higher
really
id
describe
this
one
as
clean
very
clean
flavor
has
a
real
consistent
spiced
tone
from
the
hops
hearty
and
rich
though
not
too
powerful
in
the
overall
sense
smooth
feel
more
of
a
sipper
but
its
a
nice
job
im
interested
to
see
what
the
dfh
version
is
like
im
not
going
to
lie
this
was
something
of
an
average
brew
its
not
bad
by
any
means
but
the
version
i
had
from
dfh
was
much
better
and
i
say
this
as
someone
whos
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
maverick
dfh
philosophy
a
little
thicker
than
most
pils
but
it
does
have
more
going
on
than
most
works
out
well
silky
very
pleasant
ive
had
a
few
of
these
recently
and
i
like
it
more
and
more
could
drink
a
ton
this
is
slightly
reminiscent
of
shorts
pontius
road
pilsner
in
that
im
not
sure
how
close
this
actually
is
to
qualifying
as
a
pilsner
however
whatever
it
is
it
is
quite
good
and
an
amazing
beer
i
would
love
to
drink
again
overall
this
is
one
mean
hopbomb
a
very
enjoyable
beer
but
not
one
id
quickly
drink
more
than
one
glass
of
overall
an
enjoyable
hopdelivery
vehicle
not
for
those
who
want
a
lot
of
malt
with
their
hops
but
then
again
its
an
imperial
pils
good
collab
othis
is
a
great
beer
tastes
fairly
different
to
me
than
the
other
my
antonia
it
has
more
of
a
rustic
european
taste
to
me
its
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
overall
i
havent
had
many
of
this
genre
but
this
one
is
very
good
clean
and
smooth
o
if
this
was
only
brewed
once
as
listed
this
bottle
is
getting
old
which
is
reflected
by
the
reduced
hop
presence
compared
to
the
dfh
version
i
had
not
long
ago
still
pretty
tasty
and
was
probably
even
better
fresh
do
this
beer
embraces
its
style
in
a
way
familiar
to
regular
drinkers
of
dfhs
overpriced
strong
golden
beers
in
this
case
it
chases
some
traditional
pilsner
qualities
but
cannot
entirely
shake
off
a
generic
feel
that
also
stood
out
in
such
beers
as
pangaea
and
sahtea
it
cleans
up
well
enough
in
the
finish
although
it
could
use
more
sensory
contributions
from
the
grain
od
a
pretty
nice
imperial
pilsner
too
carbonated
making
it
difficult
to
drink
at
times
but
flavourful
and
interesting
easy
to
drink
aside
from
the
carbonation
nice
stuff
o
nice
beer
quite
drinkable
and
a
good
palate
changer
good
collaboration

with

and
overall
ive
been
looking

to
this
for
a
while
and
it
didnt
dissapoint
one
of
the
better
imperial
pilsners
going
around
which
would
be
perfect
with
seafood
and
i
will
definately
buy
again
cheers
i
enjoyed
this
beer
i
cant
remember
which
version
i
liked
better
but
both
are
good
takes
on
the
imperial
pilsner
style
drinks
almost
like
an
ipa
which
is
why
i
think
i
like
it
so
much
this
is
a
very
good
beer
it
is
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
i
am
getting
turned
onto
the
imperial
pils
style
and
this
is
a
beer
i
am
going
to
be
drinking
more
of
along
with
the
bruerys
humulus
lager
o
possibly
one
of
my
favorite
beers
overall
certainly
in
its
category
definitely
one
to
try
o
this
beer
is
pretty
interesting
and
i
think
that
i
enjoy
it
better
than
the
dfh
one
i
enjoy
the
flavor
and
it
is
a
easy
drinker
that
could
be
sessionable
poured
into
a

nice
continual
carbonation
aroma
of
hops
caramel
malt
lemon
citrus
flavor
is
dominated
by
the
hops
with
a
muted
neutral
malt

some
citrus
flavors
and
a
dry
hop
finish
medium
bodied
and
creamy
quite
refreshing
hoppier
than
id
expect
from
a
pilsner
well
made
and
tasty
quite
similar
to
the
dogfish
head
version
o
i
really
liked
this
i
would
like
to
see
more
breweries
doing
this
style
of
beer
a
highly
refreshing
pilsner
this
is
what
one
expects
yet
rarely
finds
my
antonia
compliments
a
hot
summer
day
for
lunch
or
casual
conversation
one
can
only
imagine
this
would
pair
exquisitely
with
a
raw
bar
bottle
to
tulip
looks
good
smells
good
too
the
hops
are
evident
which
is
a
plus
for
a
pilsner
tastes
great
hoppy
but
light
and
crisp
mouthfeel
is
good
abv
is
hidden
nicely
overall
a
delightful
brew
probably
the
best
imperial
pilsner
ive
ever
had
o
i
enjoyed
drinking
this
beer
it
has
some
very
nice
qualities
that
make
it
more
than
just
a
beer
its
definitely
worth
trying
if
anyone
is
reading
this
but
i
dont
think
i
would
buy
it
again
its
really
like
an
overly
sweet
ipa
if
youre
a
hophead
with
a
sweettooth
this
beer
should
be
in
your
fridge
tm
wellcrafted
blend
of
hops
and
malt
here
hops
drying
crisp
malt
and
a
solid
body
behind
it
this
is
certainly
not
my
favorite
style
but
the
execution
is
excellent
with
a
focus
on
integration
the
carbonation
level
is
very
very
soft
it
makes
for
a
drinkable
beer
but
it
doesnt
brighten
up
the
flavors
very
much
overall
this
is
an
above
average
imperial
pilsner
i
do
like
this
but
it
has
some
flaws
that
bring
it
below
the
level
of
some
more
wellmade
beers
in
the
style
that
ive
had
mostly
i
cant
justify
the
pricetag
that
this
beer
carries
its
tasty
and
refreshing
but
not
at
all
worth
the
doubledigit
price
o
first
ever
imperial
pilsner
ive
ever
had
and
this
has
me
interested
in
trying
more
of
the
style
o
not
a
bad
beer
in
a
style
that
i
dont
usually
care
for
wouldnt
mind
this
again
easy
to
drink
without
any
real
alcohol
presence
oimpressed
with
this
one
i
could
see
it
going
great
with
a
greek
salad
or
a
fresh
turkey
sandwich
with
pickled
red
onions
cheers
o
ive
had
the
delaware
brewed
version
of
this
and
i
really
dont
detect
too
much
of
a
difference
i
am
having
a
hard
time
distinguishing
whether
or
not
this
is
aged
though
the
hops
are
still
very
vibrant
and
there
is
a
lot
of
fruitiness
and
bitterness
but
this
is
balanced
out
by
a
great
deal
of
mild
malts
overall
a
really
nice
collaboration
glad
i
found
the
italian
version
delicious
and
easy
to
drink
i
love
it
when
collaborations
between
breweries
work
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
it
is
very
well
crafted
the
hop
is
dominant
in
this
beer
it
is
crisp
and
balanced
well
with
the
sweet
malt
o
this
beer
has
some
odd
tendencies
but
i
can
definitely
taste
the
spirit
of
the
imperial
pilsner
its
good
good
enough
to
seek
out
the
dfhonly

theres

the

i

its
a
good

but
at
14
99
a
bottle
im
not
sure
if
id
buy
it
again
at
that
price
with
that
being
said
its
certainly
worth
trying
o
a
very
good
beer
but
not
quite
as
good
as
the
dfh
version
o
enjoyable
and
a
good
beer
but
not
the
same
as
the
dfh
version
based
on
my
notes
and
what
i
remember
it
has
been
over
a
year
since
i
have
tried
the
dfh
version
probably
will
revisit
it
soon
it
cost
more
than
a
750
ml
of
the
dfh
version
so
i
probably
wont
be
picking
it
up
again
but
i
am
very
happy
that
i
finally
tried
it
mmmmm
tasty
an
unusual
style
but
packed
with
flavour
tons
of
aromatic
hops
with
solid
malt
in
the
background
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
very
smooth
with
a
pleasing
texture
bearing
in
mind
that
a
typical
pilsner
would
be
quite
light
similar
to
a
dipa
and
just
as
good
an
excellent
showcase
of
what
italian
craft
is
capable
of
with
a
little
help
rather
hoppy
and
oddly
spicy
that
i
wasnt
expecting
the
front
seems
like
it
is
going
to
be
a
fruitful
ipa
but
then
on
the
back
end
its
very
bitter
and
even
a
little
malty
its
a
complicated
flavor
not
terribly
thrilled
about
it
but
im
warming
up
to
it
as
the
sips
go
down
o
average
beer
and
for
some
reason
not
nearly
as
good
as
dfhs
version
im
not
really
digging
the
concept
of
imperial
pilsners
either
even
though
7
5
is
not
completely
out
of
control
the
imperial
pilsener
category
is
one
of
the
worst
beer
styles
known
to
man
but
every
once
in
awhile
there
is
a
decent
one
usually
because
they
are
like
a
lager
dipa
just
keep
pilseners
the
way
they
are
they
are
better
that
way
no
need
to
imperialize
o
even
though
this
is
a
7
5
abv
beer
the
alcohol
is
completely
hidden
in
both
the
taste
and
aroma
a
good
idea
of
an
imperial
pilsner
have
had
it
several
times
now
and
will
continue
to
keep
an
eye
out
for
it
o
this
is
a
great
beer
but
i
must
admit
i
wouldnt
call
it
an
imperial
pilsner
if
it
wasnt
printed
on
the
label
if
there
is
any
character
added
by
pilsner
malt
it
is
buried
under
the
hops
taste
and
bitterness
both
of
which
point
more
to
a
strong
malty
ipa
for
me
borgo
has
created
a
fine
beer
with
dfh
and
i
think
it
shows
a
hint
of
great
things
to
come
from
them
o
i
honestly
was
expecting
to
be
dissapoited
even
though
dfh
was
involved
but
time
and
time
again
ive
been
tasting
italian
beers
and
been
truly
impressed
this
is
great
stuff
not
just
becuase
dfh
is
involved
i
will
totally
be
on
the
lookout
for
more
birra
del
borgo
pick
this
up
if
you
can
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
though
i
will
say
that
the
flavors
are
very
similar
to
a
few
other
dfh
brews
that
ive
tried
theres
nothing
really
in
this
one
that
stands
aside
from
any
of
their
other
beers
still
a
great
tasting
beer
nevertheless
the
cpj
overall
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
this
one
overall
its
damn
delicious
and
a
great
collaboration
no
surprise
that
theres
yet
another
beer
with
the
dogfish
head
logo
on
it
that
i
love
amazing
but
im
addicted
to
this
style
yellow
orange
ambrosialike
pour
with
a
fluffy
white
head
smells
lemony
and
sweet
saaz
smells
like
saaz
marmalade
is
what
i
taste
with
the
sweet
and
the
bitter
small
fuzzy
bubbles
cut
like
a
brian
adams
knife
love
that
the
bubbles
that
is
freshly
mowed
grassy
finish
more
please
d
maybe
not
something
id
want
to
have
all
the
time
but
the
flavor
was
good
o
im
giving
the
overall
a
bit
of
a
boost
because
this
is
probably
the
best
beer
ive
had
labeled
as
an
imperial
pilsner
its
really
hard
to
not
compare
the
imperial
and
american
versions
of
beers
as
something
to
a
good
ipa
that
is
similar
in
style
but
i
do
feel
that
this
separates
itself
from
being
too
close
to
an
ipaapa
and
makes
me
believe
the
imperial
pilsner
label
o
great
imperial
pils
with
a
super
clean
crisp
taste
the
12
7
oz
bottle
was
perfect
size
on
this
one
feels
dry
light
and
crisp
with
high
carbonation
a
drier
version
of
dfh
my
antonia
with
more
fruitiness
more
flavor
and
more
finesse
the
most
recent
bottle
i
bought
was
very
thick
green
glass
and
thankfully
it
did
not
affect
the
hops
character
had
this
ontap
at
the
brick
store
pub
during
their
recent
14th
anniversary
celebration
poured
amber
with
very
good
clarity
and
with
almost
no
head
still
a
fairly
pretty
beer
smells
quite
acetic
with
notes
of
peaches
lemons
and
quite
a
few
tannins
obviously
a
far
cry
from
the
original
this
beer
has
become
a
whole
new
animal
speaking
of
animals
the
taste
doesnt
really
have
any
noticeable
barnyard
notes
to
it
but
it
does
have
a
touch
of
funk
other
than
that
its
not
overly
sour
but
does
exhibit
some
acetic
notes
and
the
same
peach
and
lemon
fruit
found
in
the
aroma
smooth
and
all
around
a
pleasant
beer
but
not
earth
shaking
for
what
it
was
i
preferred
the
original
but
i
still
enjoyed
sipping
on
this
this
is
a
medium
to
light
bodied
brew
favoring
medium
more
so
than
the
lighter
side
it
is
modestly
carbonated
to
the
point
of
being
perhaps
visually
over
carbonated
and
lightly
fizzy
on
the
tongue
the
alcohol
is
ever
present
in
this
brew
in
both
flavor
and
warming
effect
it
hits
home
harder
than
what
you
would
expect
for
7
5
the
alcohol
does
not
even
attempt
to
be
hiding
it
shows
itself
in
full
force
with
greater
boldness
than
anything
else
this
brew
is
a
bit
of
a
mess
to
me
it
is
not
nearly
as
enjoyable
as
the
dfh
take
that
i
previously
really
enjoyed
i
had
no
problems
finishing
the
bottle
but
this
brew
was
a
bit
of
a
mess
i
would
not
have
it
again
o
like
the
dfh
brewed
version
this
is
an
excellent
imperial
pilsener
overall
a
great
beer
that
twists
a
simple
style
into
something
complex
beer
is
medium
in
body
and
thin
on
the
flavor
on
the
front
palate
the
beer
overall
is
bitter
on
the
end
and
mildly
dry
nice
drinking
beer
overall
but
nothing
too
complicated
just
a
solid
beer
definitely
strong
than
your
average
pilsner
id
have
it
again
but
i
wouldnt
pay
for
it
again
overall
a
great
pilsner
a
bit
more
hoppy
than
most
but
it
is
fairly
balanced
i
would
definitely
drink
again
i
could
drink
this
as
a
session
beer
even
at
7
5
overall
this
seems
a
bit
tamer
than
the
dfh
version
still
a
good
and
refreshing
beer
that
is
easy
to
consume
o
really
enjoyed
this
one
wish
i
saw
it
on
the
shelves
more
the
italians
did
a
nice
job
rendering
this
version
of
one
of
my
favorite
dfh
offerings
im
glad
i
found
it
and
hope
that
my
favorite
beer
store
relocated
it
next
to
the
dfh
so
theyll
sell
more
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
appearance
is
extremely
fizzy
and
is
probably
the
most
champagnelike
beer
ive
seen
it
is
a
pale
golden
color
with
at
least
an
inch
of
head
smell
is
strong
crisp
hops
with
mild
grains
tastes
are
crisp
hops
and
white
grape
juice
with
slight
pine
sap
and
citrus
excellent
drinkability
and
solid
allaround
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
with
an
absolutely
massive
head
that
retains
very
well
and
leaves
huge
chunks
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
very
nice
its
got
a
huge
helping
of
noble
hops
over
some
pils
malts
alcohol
is
apparent
the
taste
is
quite
smooth
smoother
than
the
dfhbrewed
version
with
some
more
subtly
than
its
americanbrewed
cousin
its
still
very
noble
hopforward
but
its
a
smoother
hoppiness
instead
of
the
sharpness
of
the
dfh
version
the
alcohol
is
also
a
bit
more
suppressed
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
less
carbonated
than
id
like
but
the
drinkability
is
good
overall
a
solid
imperial
pils
im
still
not
convinced
that
pilsners
need
to
be
imperialized
though
as
it
warmed
very
light
aroma
of
sweet
malt
and
a
faint
floral
touch
came
out
now
where
is
the
difference
between
an
imperial
ipa
and
an
imperial
pilsner
if
the
second
is
meant
to
have
more
malt
sweetness
then
this
one
is
an
imperial
ipa
overall
a
superb
brew
and
one
that
i
wish
i
could
get
my
hands
on
more
easily
highly
recommended
pours
a
light
copper
with
a
white
head
and
some
good
sticky
lacing
on
the
way
down
nose
hits
like
an
imperial
pilsner
with
a
bit
more
as
in
addition
to
some
grain
and
bread
i
got
a
bit
of
caramel
as
well
though
it
was
fairly
slight
some
european
hops
thrown
in
there
as
well
the
taste
balances
everything
quite
well
and
it
does
taste
like
an
amped
up
pilsner
feel
is
light
to
medium
with
good
carbonation
a
very
nice
collaboration
i
had
this
on
tap
at
maxs
during
their
italian
fest
its
a
wellbalanced
pilsner
but
theres
nothing
very
unique
about
it
which
surprised
me
considering
dogfish
was
involved
goldenorange
color
with
an
offwhite
head
smelled
like
it
tasted
balanced
but
nothing
special
hard
for
me
to
describe
any
individual
flavors
mouthfeel
was
pretty
good
as
is
the
drinkability
since
it
is
easy
to
drink
nothing
about
it
is
overpowered
overall
i
was
told
that
this
batch
was
not
the
best
thats
been
made
and
i
believe
it
as
the
beer
warmed
and
the
diacetyl
flavors
faded
it
was
evident
there
was
a
good
beer
underneath
it
all
but
unfortunately
i
wasnt
able
to
see
smell
or
taste
it
drinkability
nice
pilsner
probably
not
drink
again
though
although
i
may
be
a
skeptic
of
the
style
when
a
good
beer
is
made
of
any
style
i
get
it
lovethis
was
quite
good
poured
into
a
pokal
a
clear
light
to
medium
golden
with
a
large
frothy
white
crownalot
of
tiny
bubbles
big
bready
pilsner
malt
aromas
along
with
a
big
shot
of
leafyspicy
noble
hopsthe
citric
west
coast
hops
bring
a
citrusy
edge
as
well
flavors
have
light
honeylike
sweetness
along
with
mild
white
grape
like
some
maibocks
i
have
hada
real
sharp
peppery
hop
bite
hits
along
with
some
overripe
citrus
fruit
a
real
nice
lager
beernot
to
heavy
with
alot
of
things
going
on
dvery
easy
to
drink
the
7
5
feels
like
4
great
beer
for
the
summer
d
quite
palatable
and
the
unexpected
creaminess
was
a
pleasant
surprise
not
as
good
as
dfh
golden
shower
but
not
bad
a
solid
pils
that
goes
down
well
on
the
hot
summer
nights
d
i
feel
like
this
is
a
beer
that
could
catch
up
with
you
fast
quite
quaffable
but
yet
not
something
about
it
is
slightly
off
this
beer
is
way
up
there
when
it
comes
to
drinkability
it
just
hits
the
spot
i
wold
say
that
this
beer
would
be
a
great
starting
point
for
someone
who
is
learning
about
craft
beer
or
if
you
are
trying
to
ween
a
freind
off
budweiser
or
miller
lite
it
is
light
in
body
full
in
flavor
and
pairs
with
just
about
every
kind
of
food
out
there
making
this
a
great
beer
for
just
about
everyone
for
a
hot
day
like
today
this
is
just
what
i
needed
to
quench
my
thirst
and
if
you
come
across
this
beer
id
say
you
better
not
pass
it
by
its
not
brewed
continusouly
by
dogfish
in
delaware
you
know
its
going
to
be
good
when
even
the
foam
is
tasty
it
pours
with
a
big
creamy
head
the
color
is
a
slightly
cloudy
gold
the
aroma
is
big
with
grapefruit
and
hops
the
flavor
is
very
reminiscent
of
a
medium
ipa
like
their
60
minutes
but
its
somehow
cleaner
than
that
the
spiced
hops
are
there
lots
of
grapefruit
lemon
and
coriander
but
it
slides
down
the
tongue
instead
of
punching
it
the
lagering
really
helps
mellow
the
flavors
without
muting
them
you
could
down
many
of
these
without
hesitation
despite
the
7
5
alcohol
its
just
that
clean
and
smooth
without
sacrificing
flavor
why
havent
i
seen
this
before
truly
a
great
concept
and
a
new
favorite
im
not
a
huge
pilsner
fan
but
this
particular
one
is
definitely
worth
seeking
out
because
its
more
extreme
and
more
interesting
than
a
typical
pils
a
different
take
on
this
style
on
tap
at
coles
who
brought
it
in
again
golden
with
a
thick
white
head
that
leaves
lots
of
lace
i
was
ok
with
the
pils
hopsi
think
some
ideas
that
didnt
come
together
and
still
not
that
drinkable
neutral
aroma
drying
collaboration
success
its
just
too
bad
that
its
expensive
in
the
us
d
one
of
the
better
imperial
pilsners
ive
had
delicious
with
great
hop
character
it
definitely
stood
out
from
the
other
italian
beers
i
had
on
this
day
this
is
a
very
interesting
beer
had
a
nice
golden
appearance
with
a
nice
head
lacing
which
sticks
to
the
glass
has
some
nice
hop
aroma
but
a
nice
malt
to
balance
it
out
as
well
a
pretty
balanced
beer
overall
a
good
crisp
light
taste
but
still
a
firm
malt
backbone
a
very
drinkable
beer
for
7
5
abv
taste
is
light
and
crisp
for
an
imperial
pilsner
the
hops
meld
well
with
the
malt
with
neither
overshadowing
the
other
finishes
a
bit
spicy
on
tap
at
the
lions
pride
i
too
was
looking
forward
to
having
some
belgian
beers
but
couldnt
pass
this
up
in
a
tulip
glass
the
beer
was
a
clear
gold
color
with
a
voluminous
white
head
lots
of
lacing
a
very
fresh
outdoors
aroma
like
newly
mown
grass
hoppy
with
a
big
malt
influence
kind
of
breadlike
a
great
bohemian
pilsner
very
drinkable
two
went
down
fairly
quickly
reviewed
from
my
notes
served
in
a
brand
new
lions
pride
goblet
as
my
first
beer
of
their
belgian
beer
festival
i
found
it
quite
funny
to
order
an
italianamerican
collaboration
as
my
initial
beer
of
a
belgian
fest
but
i
didnt
want
to
pass
up
this
brew
as
id
never
seen
if
poured
before
it
has
a
very
pretty
tarnished
gold
color
it
is
very
clear
as
a
good
pilsner
should
be
it
had
a
large
foam
head
that
was
pure
white
it
left
behind
lots
of
lacing
as
i
drank
it
surprisingly
i
couldnt
see
any
carbonation
rising
within
the
glass
it
had
a
musty
yeast
aroma
with
some
sour
citrus
mixed
in
as
well
my
impressions
of
the
flavor
were
creamy
malty
and
a
bit
fruity
there
was
a
touch
of
crystal
sugar
i
could
taste
a
nod
to
the
imperial
nature
of
this
beer
but
it
was
subtle
it
had
a
medium
body
and
a
medium
level
of
coating
it
felt
good
but
was
not
remarkable
i
found
it
to
be
very
drinkable
i
thought
it
would
go
well
with
a
pork
dish
i
could
see
myself
enjoying
a
few
glasses
of
this
over
a
great
meal
had
this
on
tap
at
the
thirsty
monk
in
asheville
nc
the
light
straw
color
and
thin
lacey
head
made
me
think
this
beer
would
be
much
lighter
and
belgian
in
flavor
i
was
extremely
surprised
to
find
that
this
is
an
excellent
well
hopped
pilsner
theres
a
good
amount
of
lingering
hop
bitterness
as
this
beer
goes
down
and
it
goes
down
very
easy
for
7
5
very
impressed
with
this
one
a
definite
must
try
this
beer
has
a
lot
of
finesse
going
one
quite
enjoyable
very
drinkable
if
you
could
come
across
that
much
d
this
is
a
really
nice
imperial
pilsner
which
is
really
quite
a
rare
thing
it
has
a
wonderful
aroma
of
pilsner
malt
and
interesting
spice
notes
as
well
as
an
intense
hop
flavor
that
keeps
it
quite
well
balanced
and
drinkable
unlike
most
other
imperial
pilsners
it
does
not
become
cloyingly
sweet
and
the
hop
character
is
complex
and
interesting
instead
of
the
flat
bitterness
that
some
other
examples
of
the
style
display
i
would
happily
drink
this
again
though
i
dont
expect
that
i
will
get
the
chance
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
good
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
good
flavorful
beer
that
is
worth
drinking
for
a
while
d
this
is
probably
the
best
example
of
a
imperial
pilsner
that
does
well
as
a
regular
pilsner
a
really
great
beer
i
want
to
know
what
it
is
that
i
am
picking
up
in
the
nose
good
example
of
a
collaboration
working
well
rare
as
hell
but
good
and
should
be
bottled
just
about
the
biggest
pilsner
ever
too
big
to
be
very
sippable
but
impressive
a
superb
brew
that
i
wish
i
could
keep
around

postreview

i
agree
with
johnmichaelsons
review
in
that
this
does
not

i

beer
is
best
approached
without
the
preconception
of
czech
or
german

on

the

a

highlights
forming
a
lovely
eggshell
white
head
above
the

with
nice
lasting
power

the

leaves
thin
sheetlike

the

the

smells
deliciously
spicy
with
a
nice

grape
character
balancing
out
the
spicy

bready
malt
gives
further
finesse
to
the
smell
lending
it
a
balanced
germenesque
twist
that
separates
it
from
other
ipls
ive
smelt
this
beer
has
plenty
of
hops
but
they
are
balanced
and
deliciously
delicate
as
it
warms
i
get
a
scent
of
nettles
and
a
cool
spring
meadow
i
like
the
scent
on
the
tongue
the
beer
tastes
fruity
up
front
transitioning
into
a
bready
sweetness
that
is
balanced
by
a
healthy
herbal
bitter
bite
that
eventually
dries
out
the
finish
slight
acidity
does
begin
the
sip
and
puts
a
vinous
pop
to
the
mouth
in
flavor
the
beer
begins
as
sweet
riesling
swiftly
gaining
a
bready
nearly
ryelike
spice
that
then
plunges
into
grassy
citrus
with
nuances
of
hay
and
a
faint
kick
of
pale
malt
the
spice
develops
peppery
hints
moving
from
green
pepper
flesh
to
white
pepper
spice
as
the
beer
warms
in
the
mouth
the
beer
feels
medium
bodied
with
a
crispthoughheavy
mouthfeel
and
middling
carbonation
that
gives
the
tongue
a
nice
fluffing
and
a
slight
prickle
when
the
beer
leaves
the
tongue
is
left
with
a
resinous
sheen
of
spittle
while
the
mouth
feels
dry
and
bitter
in
all
despite
its
heavier
mouthfeel
the
beer
goes
down
bizarrely
easy
making
it
far
too
easy
to
drink
ive
put
that
to
the
test
this
is
a
lovely
variation
from
the
ipaswithlageryeast
trend
that
ipls
have
been
following
as
of
late
and
it
actually
piques
my
interest
as
to
continuation
of
this
style
look
at
the
complexity
and
subtlety
that
can
be
squeezed
from
mildernonamerican
hops
used
in
abundance
o
one
of
the
finest
things
ive
had
by
smuttynose
i
bought
this
one
on
a
whim
having
never
heard
of
their
big
beer
series
and
this
one
sold
me
on
the
first
sip
very
well
balanced
and
id
recommend
it
to
anyone
the
price
is
a
bit
steep
but
its
worth
it
i
like
most
of
the
beers
i
have
tasted
from
the
brewery
and
although
its
a
good
beer
its
not
the
aromataste
profile
i
enjoy
drinking
o
this
beer
has
a
nice
amount
of
hops
for
an
imperial
pilsener
which
really
balance
out
the
malts
and
makes
the
mouthfeel
seem
lighter
than
it
actually
is
o
a
solid
ipl
with
a
good
balance
between
the
bitterness
and
fruity
notes
from
the
hops
and
the
bready
and
grainy
notes
from
the
malts
very
easy
to
drink
and
a
great
alternative
from
your
typical
ipa
or
pilsner
overall
i
never
hesitate
to
grab
these
big
beers
from
smuttynose
this
one
was
a
touch
off
but
an
interesting
ride
for
sure
o
a
very
interesting
brew
not
what
i
expected
but
i
enjoyed
it
nonetheless
smutty
does
a
fine
job
with
everything
it
helps
to
get
ti
fresh
very
lightly
toasted
pale
malt
start
that
quickly
succumbs
to
white
pepper
bite
of
the
hop
much
richer
body
than
most
lagers
other
than
the
flavor
it
would
rival
a
doppelbock
highly
carbonated
not
extreme
but
definitely
better
for
the
hop
heads
but
still
a
very
easy
to
drink
big
beer
this
is
an
ipl
but
it
seems
to
have
a
more
pilsener
quality
to
it
with
those
grainy
malts
sweetness
and
an
added
bonus
of
orange
andor
citrus
with
a
crisp
clean
finish
o
i
personally
enjoyed
this
beer
but
im
not
sure
if
the
average
beer
geek
will
get
where
this
is
coming
from
these
days
ipl
automatically
calls
jacks
abby
and
their
hoponius
union
to
mind
at
least
in
this
market
for
good
reason
too
they
basically
created
the
style
this
beer
is
not
really
a
riff
off
of
that
approach
though
it
isnt
boldly
hoppy
in
the
vein
of
a
west
coast
ipa
it
comes
off
more
as
a
great
big
dortmunder
lager
with
some
nice
supporting
tropical
hops
but
the
average
beer
aficionado
still
doesnt
know
much
about
the
dortmunder
style
either
so
marketing
it
that
way
wouldnt
be
any
better
really
i
guess
im
rambling
bottom
line
is
that
this
is
a
good
beer
though
frankenlager
is
indeed
a
lager
at
heart
its
strength
exceedes
the
normal
ranges
for
such
pilsners
and
its
hop
character
is
as
experimental
as
it
is
refined
all
come
together
to
give
this
golden
ale
a
striking
command
at
both
lager
brewing
and
new
wave
hop
usage

summer
staple
first
durty
sick
packs
and
now
this
jem
big
year
for
smuttynose
oi
was
pretty
excited
to
try
this
but
i
think
it
didnt
really
pan
out
the
first
sip
wasnt
all
that
fun
and
even
when
i
became
accustomed
to
the
flavor
i
still
wasnt
very
impressed
after
about
half
the
bomber
it
did
grow
on
me
a
bit
so
overall
it
turned
out
to
be
a
pretty
decent
beer
ive
been
slightly
into
the
recent
lager
rebirth
jacks
abbey
is
making
some
great
beer
this
smutty
is
actually
fantastic
great
copper
color
lots
of
puffy
white
head
and
lacing
the
nose
is
a
little
weak
as
imo
all
lagers
are
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
and
pretty
solid
lots
of
citrusy
fruit
carbonation
and
a
hint
of
bitter
overall
im
very
surprised
by
how
much
i
like
this
it
was
also
brewed
about
2
miles
from
my
house
at
smuttys
new
brewery
so
cheers
this
is
a
great
hoppy
lager
its
very
flavorful
without
being
particularly
aggressive
or
bitter
not
that
there
is
anything
wrong
with
aggressively
hoppy
lagers
its
definitely
worth
a
try
ill
probably
buy
a
bottle
or
two
of
this
its
smuttynose
and
thats
a
good
thing
a
bit
sweeter
than
the
typical
ipl
but
it
works
hyper
fruity
which
messes
with
a
bit
of
the
overall
drinkability
prosit
1646
uncarbonated
and
sour
may
have
just
had
a
bad
bottle
the
head
on
this
beer
is
pretty
remarkable
nice
lacing
as
the
bottle
describes
high
in
alcohol
but
very
approachable
o
i
got
this
to
better
understand
the
style
of
ipl
which
i
was
told
this
represents
by
the
experts
at
bruisin
ales
in
asheville
i
had
hitachinos
nipponia
a
while
back
and
this
is
also
considered
an
imperial
pilsner
as
this
one
is
so
i
am
guessing
ipls
and
imperial
pilsners
are
considered
to
be
under
the
same
category
not
yet
specified
by
some
experts
of
the
two
nipponia
is
superior
in
my
opinion
tilted
smile
is
good
however
and
worth
a
try
bottled
two
years
ago
but
stored
in
a
dark
68
degree
area
for
18
months
or
so
its
been
in
my
possession
i
mention
this
because
on
one
hand
i
think
this
beer
might
have
turned
a
bit
but
reading
through
the
reviews
plenty
of
them
mention
an
overly
sweet
taste
and
mine
is
almost
syrupy
smells
faintly
of
citrus
but
also
rusty
water
plenty
of
carbonation
and
lace
left
though
so
maybe
this
is
just
far
more
sweet
and
sticky
than
i
prefer
o
not
a
bad
brew
flavors
seem
more
like
a
belgianpilsner
normally
i
prefer
a
pilsner
to
be
lighter
and
more
dry
definitely
a
beer
worth
trying
but
not
one
im
likely
to
come
back
to
often
i
do
love
the
labeling
though
a
really
great
beer
and
style
i
havent
seen
before
even
though
it
has
a
higher
alcohol
content
the
beer
didnt
have
an
alcohol
flavor
to
it
it
came
in
a
22
oz
bottle
and
was
a
perfect
size
and
abv
to
share
with
2
other
people
everyone
enjoyed
it
there
is
no
hoppiness
to
the
beer
as
would
be
expected
with
a
pilsner
but
my
biggest
pet
peeve
is
when
pilsners
have
an
overwhelming
amount
of
that
strong
pilsner
malt
but
this
one
did
not
at
all
it
was
a
great
balance
of
a
strong
beer
and
a
pilsner
if
imperial
pilsner
wasnt
written
on
the
bottle
i
would
have
had
a
hard
time
putting
this
beer
into
a
category
overall
this
imperial
pilsner
is
a
bit
too
much
for
me
alcohol
is
a
bit
much
along
with
the
pilsner
malts
the
hops
are
nice
and
traditional
im
not
the
biggest
fan
of
this
style
usually
but
this
one
is
spoton
big
in
all
the
right
ways
while
still
leaving
room
for
the
classic
aspects
of
a
pilsner
i
also
appreciate
any
brewer
that
can
create
a
well
rounded
imp
pils
not
an
easy
style
almost
blasphemous
in
many
regards
but
it
certainly
is
a
stylebender
and
envelope
pusher
pours
a
three
finger
offwhite
head
that
fades
slowly
leaving
some
lace
crystal
clear
ambercopper
color
good
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
sweet
grapefruit
nose
and
flavor
is
grapefruit
and
caramel
higher
abv
is
hidden
worth
trying
8
49
for
a
caged
and
corked
750ml
bottle
from
hannafords
concord
nh
in
the
end
im
disappointed
because
almost
everything
on
the
label
about
the
beer
has
been
completely
the
opposite
pours
a
murky
orange
with
a
foamy
beige
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
foamy
swaths
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
grain
grass
and
slight
alcohol
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
sweet
grain
and
grassy
hop
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
is
tasty
but
there
is
an
alcohol
bite
after
each
sip
that
slightly
takes
away
from
the
drinkability
in
my
opinion
pours
a
golden
copper
color
witha
two
plus
finger
fo
white
fizzy
foam
on
the
nose
its
a
bit
sweet
with
a
honeyed
grassy
profile
that
mixes
with
a
bit
of
fruity
yeast
on
the
palate
it
is
more
of
the
same
a
touch
sticky
and
the
yeasty
fruit
flavors
far
outweigh
the
saaz
hops
and
the
bready
pilsen
malts
this
finishes
clashing
sweetness
with
a
moderate
bitter
thank
goodness
the
carbonation
was
more
than
ample
to
keep
the
body
of
this
beer
from
being
heavy
like
a
rock
the
corn
outdoes
the
spice
and
that
is
half
the
flavor
of
the
pils
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
its
a
little
slick
on
the
palate
and
overall
just
average
pours
medium
amber
slightly
dark
with
huge
white
foam
sticks
everywhere
light
malt
layered
nose
hints
sweet
taste
is
straw
like
light
but
with
a
firm
hop
crisp
and
boozy
overall
i
really
like
this
one
and
heartily
recommend
nice
taste
not
amazing
but
there
was
something
about
the
head
that
just
felt
great
not
at
all
the
gossamer
insubstantiality
of
other
lights
but
rather
a
curiously
coherent
dense
foam
approaching
what
the
chewiness
of
hops
itself
that
was
different
exciting
and
enticing
o
booze
dominates
this
beer
nose
is
just
about
nonexistent
small
carmel
booze
and
a
hint
of
barley
uinta
must
tone
down
the
booze
carmel
is
nice
more
saaz
crisp
this
up
this
is
straight
sugary
maltiness
germans
would
be
disgusted
with
this
pilsner
i
dont
recommend
this
o
supremely
wellbalanced
a
place
for
everything
and
everything
in
its
place
great
execution
of
this
uncommon
and
difficult
style
overall
its
just
a
good
flavorful
version
of
a
pilsner
which
is
usually
a
really
lack
luster
brew
style
save
for
the
few
that
add
some
light
super
dry
hopping
mouthfeel
the
heat
in
the
presence
is
neat
in
a
pilsener
style
but
its
not
all
that
distracting
medium
bodied
but
heavy
for
a
pilsner
a
little
thick
actually
carbonation
feels
lazy
different
take
on
the
style
moderatley
complex
flavors
im
sure
this
would
rank
a
bit
higher
with
fresher
example
pours
a
big
frothy
two
plus
finger
head
of
eggshell
white
mainly
dense
microfoam
but
some
larger
bubbles
interspersed
here
and
there
adequate
plus
retention
the
lacing
is
actually
much
stronger
than
youd
expect
and
the
residue
all
but
fully
coats
the
inside
walls
of
the
glass
the
liquid
is
a
dull
rust
water
orange
light
in
hue
and
more
pale
yellow
at
the
rims
and
glass
bottom
the
widely
dispersed
tiny
bubbles
are
active
as
they
rise
the
nose
is
quite
fruity
with
pear
yellow
apple
fig
and
peach
notes
some
pepper
and
then
salted
pretzels
more
straight
up
malt
than
associated
scents
like
chocolate
not
herbaceous
but
has
a
stiff
spine
some
cornmeal
but
the
good
kind
fullbodied
almost
heavy
for
its
type
with
an
unusual
emphasis
on
sweet
citrus
a
blend
of
lemon
grapefruit
and
orange
very
dominant
leafier
here
the
hops
come
through
in
a
drying
sense
helps
balance
out
that
citrus
as
well
as
the
apricot
pear
mango
cantaloupe
fruit
at
times
close
to
honeyed
the
carbonation
stays
on
the
fluffy
side
and
spreads
it
like
glue
across
the
palate
buttered
biscuits
and
some
sweet
corn
but
nothing
in
the
area
of
adjunct
land
this
is
a
definite
take
on
the
style
and
not
a
classic
rendition
as
such
more
likely
to
polarize
but
in
the
end
its
fun
taken
on
its
own
terms
and
just
thrown
back
in
that
spirit
would
have
this
again
as
the
weather
warms
interesting
take
on
the
style
overall
this
was
a
rather
interesting
brew
the
aroma
with
its
fermenting
melon
smells
was
slightly
off
putting
but
not
totally
so
somewhat
intriguing
its
taste
was
rather
unique
with
a
fascinating
mixture
of
flavors
and
transitions
i
kind
of
liked
the
odd
flavor
profile
and
while
it
is
not
something
i
would
go
frequently
it
is
worth
a
try
and
a
time
to
time
go
to
bottle
poured
a
hazy
dirty
beige
color
pilsner
with
a
rather
large
offwhite
foamy

with

and
some

of
dry
and
floral

with
some

quite

above

with

of
age
ratings
gotta
reflect
the
love
this
just
showed
up
in
maine
i
hope
to
find
other
beers
from
uinta
o
a
solid
imperial
pilsner
with
complexity
and
depth
very
easy
to
drink
given
the
abv
worth
a
try
if
youre
into
imperial
pilsners
or
lagers
as
far
as
this
beer
goes
there
are
a
lot
of
grain
tones
to
it
quite
boozy
its
just
a
boozy
alcoholic
pilsener
really
nothing
overly
interesting
about
it
or
interesting
at
all
really
just
a
beer
and
thus
ends
this
whole
utah
thing
o
shouldnt
have
aged
this
long
id
like
to
see
what
it
tastes
like
fresh
i
didnt
mind
this
but
it
wasnt
great
3

o
the
taste
was
the
big
let
down
in
this
one
i
found
it
to
be
too
one
dimensional
some
added
complexity
particularly
the
sort
that
was
found
in
the
aroma
could
really
add
some
value
to
this
beer
i
havent
had
many
imperial
pilsners
yet
but
despite
the
disappointing
lack
of
complexity
in
the
taste
this
seems
to
be
an
adequate
example
of
the
style

everything

than

in
any

this
is
a
tasty
beer
and
im
happy
to
be
drinking
it
o
ok
not
a
worldchanger
booziness
not
evident
decent
brew
overall
not
something
youd
knock
down
alot
of
rich
and
boozy
this
needs
to
be
sipped
worth
trying
o
ok
o
not
bad
on
its
own
but
certainly
not
representative
of
the
style
and
not
as
strong
as
i
expected
it
to
be
o
a
pleasant
version
of
a
pilsner
i
would
never
guessed
it
was
9
abv
but
it
was
definitely
too
sweet
for
the
style
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
stemmed
pilsner
glass
the
beer
is
a
slighlty
hazy
amber
tinted
yellowgold
coloring
with
a
tall
frothy
foamy
white
head
that
starts
around
an
inch
and
a
half
and
slowly
settles
into
a
dense
cap
on
the
brew
good
lacing
along
the
glass
as
you
go
aromas
are
blended
well
and
subtle
with
a
toasted
backbone
and
some
buttery
highlights
as
well
as
a
slightly
sour
character
flavors
are
bold
with
a
boozey
kick
biscuity
backbone
with
a
butter
sweet
blending
and
some
floral
and
citrus
highlights
this
beer
is
a
mouthfull
but
remains
smooth
and
midbodied
in
mouth
the
aftertaste
is
more
of
the
toasted
grain
flavoring
common
of
a
pilsner
leading
to
smooth
clean
finish
tasty
beer
at
thirsty
monk
pours
a
yellowish
with
a
fizzy
head
as
is
indicative
of
a
pils
slightly
darker
than
typical
though
taste
is
grassy
from
the
saaz
hops
up
front
but
there
is
a
much
richer
malt
backbone
than
is
typical
drinks
like
an
ipa
without
the
hop
dominance
nice
brew
pretty
good
take
on
the
style
here
i
could
go
for
more
prominent
hops
but
the
malt
bill
seems
pretty
choice
for
showcasing
the
old
pilsner
malts
id
definitely
like
to
drink
it
again
o
for
a
double
pilsner
it
is
pretty
good
not
a
big
fan
of
the
style
but
it
is
definitely
better
than
others
i
have
tried
an
excellent
and
rather
unique
example
of
the
style
while
not
a
replacement
for
my
favorite
retired
imperial
pilsners

yeast
combine
for

overall
a

ops
here
and
there
finish
is
particularly
alcholic
once
this
beer
warms
a
sipping
pils
overall
pretty
good
and
something
id
recommend
for
converting
a
bmc
drinker
to
the
craft
side
overall
a
good
beer
in
a
style
i
dont
drink
all
that
often
the
abv
is
well
hidden
and
it
goes
down
smooth
id
definitely
drink
this
again
perhaps
on
a
hot
day
behind
the
bbq
if
i
was
looking
to
go
a
different
route
than
an
ipa
o
i
really
like
this
beer
it
is
very
drinkable
which
makes
it
dangerous
at
9
definitely
worth
the
7
bucks
and
will
most
likely
pick
more
up
in
the
future
mouthfeel
is
particularly
disappointing
even
though
it
is

definitely
drinks
smooth

i
just
dont
think
the
pilsner
style
lends
itself
very
well
to
imperialization
at
least
or
me
to
see
if
the
hops
are
more
prevalent
nearly
seductive
thing
of
subtlety
and
nuance
that
i
can
appreciate
ill
award
tilted

a
high
score

pours

with
a

that
laces
on

the
smell
is
distinctly
of
that
sour
pilsner
aroma
or
overly
sweet
nice
and
mellow
like
a
pilsner
should
be
not
a
ton
going
on
in
this
beer
but
theres
nothing
there
motivating
you
to
want
to
drink
more
that
said
hoppy
but
this
is
a
pretty
average

all
that
and
i
am
not
impressed
hard
to
really
know
what
to
say
about
this
one
this
is
a
style
that
you
dont
really
see
a
lot
of
so
who
can
say
what
is
closest
to
style
guidelines
and
all
this
one
strikes
me
as
pretty
good
a
bit
boozy
and
burning
spicy
edges
to
it
a
bit
thick
grain
and
hearty
tones
that
stay
consistent
and
firm
even
though
this
is
a
bit
thicker
i
find
it
quite
easy
and
pleasurable
to
drink
i
could
deal
with
more
of
this
glad
i
had
a
chance
to
try
this
one
pours
a
deep
golden
color
with
a
healthy
frothy
head
with
a
fair
amount
of
haze
can
smell
the
hops
eminating
as
it
is
pouring
extremely
floral
nose
with
grapefruit
and
a
touch
of
sweetness
pouring
through
the
odors
very
sweet
at
first
immediately
turning
to
notes
of
bitterness
and
malt
all
the
traditional
pilsner
flavors
are
there
but
theyve
taken
the
best
ones
and
boosted
them
thin
mouthfeel
with
the
perfect
amount
of
carbonation
flavors
continue
to
linger
meld
and
change
for
as
long
as
a
minute
after
it
goes
down
the
hatch
i
really
liked
this
one
but
havent
had
many
imperial
pilsners
overall
i
thought
that
this
was
a
good
beer
and
a
slightly
above
average
imperial
pilsener
this
wasnt
a
very
complex
beer
but
it
did
have
some
nice
simple
flavors
and
aromas
that
were
just
as
they
should
be
and
pretty
well
done
this
beer
has
pretty
good
drinkability
usually
these
imperial
pilseners
can
be
pretty
bitter
and
not
that
drinkable
but
with
this
beer
the
bitterness
is
kept
in
check
and
i
could
see
myself
having
two
or
three
of
these
what
i
liked
most
about
this
beer
was
the
appearance
it
looked
really
good
poured
into
a
pilsener
glass
what
i
liked
least
about
this
beer
was
the
higher
amount
of
carbonation
and
the
fact
that
they
call
this
an
imperial
pilsener
this
beer
was
more
american
pilsener
then
imperial
pilsener
it
didnt
have
the
high
amount
of
bitterness
and
hops
that
i
associate
with
that
style
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
when
looking
for
a
good
pilsener
but
at
2
59
its
a
little
pricey
for
what
it
is
if
your
a
pilsener
fan
this
beer
is
worth
giving
a
try
but
dont
expect
this
beer
to
be
as
intense
as
most
imperial
pilseners
i
think
this
beer
held
up
pretty
well
and
wasnt
to
affected
by
the
age
but
i
would
still
like
to
try
a
fresher
bottle
atwater
has
been
hit
or
miss
for
me
lately
and
this
beer
proved
to
be
more
hit
then
miss
all
in
all
it
was
a
solid
pilsener
that
was
pretty
smooth
and
had
a
good
flavor
good
job
with
this
beer
its
got
just
about
everything
that
i
look
for
in
a
american
pilsener
pours
a
clear
pale
gold
color
with
a
white
foam
collar
and
plenty
of
lacework
aroma
is
grassy
and
piney
with
hints
of
bready
malts
underneath
lots
of
hops
and
a
good
level
of
bitterness
the
atwater
take
on
an
imperial
pilsner
tastes
alot
like
an
ipa
citrus
rind
alcohol
and
malt
sweetness
all
mix
pretty
well
together
mouthfeel
is
at
a
lightmedium
overall
a
decent
big
pilsner
with
bright
hop
character
o
very
flavorful
considering
the
lower
alcohol
content
for
the
style
tasty
while
only
my
second
example
of
the
style
i
have
to
say
that
this
category
of
our
favourite
elixir
does
not
exactly
blow
up
my
skirt
tastes
essentially
like
a
boozy
pils
of
dubious
quality
with
none
of
the
extra
backing
characteristics
capable
of
hiding
such
alcohol
intransigence
not
a
bad
offering
from
a
brewery
that
has
yet
to
impress
me
this
beer
adds
some
more
credibility
in
my
mind
dont
be
afraid
to
give
this
one
a
shot
overall
kinda
meh
some
off
aromas
and
flavors
not
much
of
a
pilsner
flavor
just
some
light
toasty
malts
fairly
bitter
and
kinda
overpowers
the
whole
uber
pils
effect
pours
a
deep
straw
semi
hazed
hue
with
a
bright
white
head
forming
thick
fine
evenly
spread
lacing
on
the
sides
of
my
glass
aroma
is
quite
pleasant
with
herbalcitrusgrassy
hop
highlights
and
some
warm
biscuitmalt
notes
arising
flavor
has
some
caramel
and
some
rough
grain
notes
keep
in
mind
this
is
an
uber
ursa
pils
whatever
that
means
big
bear
next
hops
are
muddled
and
the
malts
have
a
really
serious
huskgraininess
going
on
this
should
be
a
relatively
cleaner
style
even
if
its
a
double
pils
the
hops
are
more
of
an
unrelenting
hop
pellet
bitterness
very
herbalearthy
in
nature
and
the
malt
sweetness
does
come
out
a
bit
more
with
each
sip
no
discernable
or
unrelenting
booze
on
the
palate
mouthfeel
is
dry
finish
a
bit
fuller
in
malt
body
than
the
average
crisp
pils
but
again
its
an
amped
up
version
carbonation
really
no
complaints
there
only
issue
would
be
a
bit
of
a
cloying
residual
malt
aspect
that
is
felt
on
the
palate
between
sips
overall
an
interesting
beer
that
imm
glad
i
tried
i
keep
trying
the
single
batch
series
even
though
their
standard
lineup
hasnt
really
impressed
me
yet
thin
white
head
that
clings
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
on
a
hazy
peach
colored
body
some
flowery
nobel
hop
aroma
but
a
pretty
weak
smell
overall
the
taste
however
doesnt
disappointassuming
you
like
bitter
beers
uber
ursa
has
a
nice
dose
of
cheekpuckering
bitterness
this
beer
is
okay
but
it
would
be
a
little
better
with
more
carbonation
and
a
little
less
sweetness
this
is
a
beer
that
started
out
looking
and
smelling
quite
nice
but
really
disappointed
in
the
taste
department
i
am
usually
a
big
fan
of
imperial
pils
but
this
one
just
did
not
measure
up
i
would
definitely
not
recommend
this
brew

just
a

noble

consistent

however

i
did
enjoy

overall
this
is
a
solid
representation

definitely
not

as

i
have
tried
give
it
a
shot
if
you
see
this
brew
i
have
had

i
like
it
overall
i
think
this
was
definitely
a
miss
for
blue
mountain
i
really
enjoy
most
of
their
beers
but
getting
through
a
full
bomber
of
this
was
a
struggle
maybe
i
havent
grown
accustomed
to
the
style
but
it
tastes
like
a
super
thick
super
sweet
bmc
beer
to
me
i
dont
completely
hate
the
brew
but
definitely
wouldnt
buy
again
at
the
price
point
this
is
sold
at
best
by

no
wonder
it

tinged

in

still
seem
pretty
fresh
with
dryer
malty

and
some
toasted

decent
shot
of
herballeafy
hops
are
there
and
the
alcohol
presence
is
not
a
lighter
double
pilsnerits
not
heavy
and
or
sweeti
liked
it
but
it
wont
knock
your
socks
off
mehhhh
overall
there
are
few
good
beers
in
this
genre
this
one
isnt
bad
i
just
wanted
more
out
of
it
o
i
couldnt
even
finish
it
too
strong
too
lagery
too
mediocre
to
recover
from
the
immense
graininess
drinkability
this
was
one
of
the
my
favorites
during
my
visits
to
the
brewery
on
my
trip
easy
to
drink
and
satisfying
d
a
very
palatable
imperial
pilsener
that
would
be
a
great
hot
weather
brew
another
nice
lager
from
bm
and
shows
they
can
produce
pretty
much
any
style
enjoyably
this
aint
just
any
pils
its
an
uberpils
insert
exhaley
cheering
facsimile
it
pours
a
clear
pale
straw
topped
by
over
a
finger
of
white
foam
the
nose
is
rather
faint
and
bland
comprising
only
some
light
wheat
and
florals
the
taste
improves
on
the
smell
with
notes
of
cooked
wheat
light
biscuit
and
a
nicely
and
somewhat
surprisingly
subtle
floral
bitterness
the
body
is
light
with
a
lightly
moderate
carbonation
and
a
crsp
dry
finish
overall
a
solid
imperial
pils
if
only
it
had
some
kind
of
nose
this
is
a
double
pils
that
doesnt
forget
what
a
pils
should
be
and
then
expands
on
all
the
right
facets
of
the
style
a
fantastic
beer
one
i
hope
blue
mountain
will
consider
brewing
yearround

id
been
looking
forward
to
this
one
and
wasnt
disappointed
its
definitely
not
bmbs
best
brew
but
it
fits
the
time
and
place
perfectly
a
strong
and
flavorful
beer
that
is
still
light
enough
on
the
palette
and
crisp
enough
in
the
mouth
for
a
warm
july
afternoon
in
nelson
county
virginia
the
abv
truth
be
told
isnt
really
that
high
for
an
american
di
pilsener
just
enhancing
its
drinkability
a
little
more
another
welcome
hopefully
seasonal
to
bmbs

and
one
im
looking

to
trying
again

the

is
less
than
expected

on

on

of
the
first
beers
to

identify
the
infamous

note
some
hops
apparently
evince
combined
with
a
noteworthy
sulfuric
note
not
uncommon
in
lagers
but
amped
up
to
an
overbearing
level
here
i
just
couldnt
get
into
this
brew
i
admit
that
the
double
ipl
has
historically
been
a
touchy
style
for
me
but
humulus
was
one
i
just
couldnt
abide
hop
hop
hop
hop
hop
an
absolutely
delicious
hoppy
concoction
a
bit
out
of
the
typical
wheelhouse
of
the
bruery
it
seems
this
shows
they
can
make
a
hoppy
beer
with
the
best
of
them
o
very
tasty
goes
down
very
easily
not
too
filling
decent
kick
very
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
very
solid
beer
to
drink
for
a
long
time
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
the
style
well
balanced
and
enjoyable
beer
that
keeps
the
abv
wellhidden
overall
not
what
i
was
expecting
this
had
a
buttery
grainy
taste
to
it
that
was
not
appealing
i
usually
like
bruery
beers
but
this
did
not
come
together
for
me
i
will
be
passing
on
this
o
crazy
hoppy
and
smooth
great
bitterness
clean
and
easy
first
hoppy
lager
that
i
probably
wouldnt
know
is
a
lager
unless
i
was
told
it
o
very
nice
and
very
easy
drinking
this
drinks
almost
like
an
ipa
but
with
a
slightly
different
mouthfeel
definitely
one
of
the
better
ipls
ive
had
the
style
is
getting
some
nice
attention
and
what
ive
seen
recently
i
e
this
and
dissenter
have
me
wanting
the
next
one

a
nice

is
exactly
like

bitter
dry

refreshing
and
easy
to

i
dont
know
why
they
bother
with
the
lager
label
in
any
case
this
is
a
great

i
love
in

without
the
bitter
bang
that
can
turn
me
off

one
i

hopped
double
ipa
and
the
lager
qualities
stand
out
hard
not
to
compare
this
to
jacks
abby
offerings
and
it
just
doesnt
match
up
while
very
delicious
it
lacks
consistency
and
has
some
rough
edges
further
proof
that
lagers
can
be
quite
flavorful
bitter
and
oily
like
an
ipa
with
the
refreshing
dry
crispness
of
a
pilsner
a
hoppy
departure
from
the
bruerys
standard
fare
and
good
stuff
in
a
very
different
way
than
what
i
typically
drink
by
them
come
on
ride
that
train
and
ride
it
its
a
choo
choo
train
o
great
brew
refreshing
easy
to
drink
overall
the
more
i
drink
it
the
less
i
like
it
i
guess
its
good
for
a
pilsner
but
that
doesnt
say
a
whole
lot
clean
gold
covered
with
a
sticky
purewhite
head
stinky
leafy
citrus
and
fresh
hop
pellets
in
the
nose
grass
and
pineapple
becoming
more
pungent
and
spicy
towards
the
bottom
of
the
glass
fresh
peppery
citrus
spicy
bitter
pine
peach
and
grapefruit
hop
flavors
a
bit
of
trailing
crackerlike
malts
but
the
focus
is
squarely
on
the
hop
resins
drying
fairly
crisp
and
extremely
drinkable
for
a
style
that
can
sometimes
be
a
little
tedious
bold
and
crisp
golden
body
with
a
perfect
head
smell
is
piney
and
bright
really
sharp
and
biting
bitterness
with
a
really
clean
and
crisp
lager
body
reminds
me
off
a
bigger
and
more
bitter
jacks
abby
hoppy
lager
booze
is
hidden
well
behind
grapefruit
rind
light
pine
and
some
mango
hoponius
of
the
west
i
suppose
glad
to
be
able
to
finally
try
this
one
a
brew
i
would
gladly
drink
again
rather
sharp
after
some
sipping
really
spicy
hop
flavors
linger
invitingly
wafted
up
by
the
hottish
alcohol
some
deep
fruity
flavors
that
remind
me
of
mango
and
apricots
a
tasty
brew
that
seems
stronger
than
it
really
is
and
a
good
example
of
another
homegrown
style
that
seems
to
have
a
reason
to
exist
my
favorite
bruery
product
so
far
o
great
tasting
beer
but
not
sure
i
would
rate
this
as
a
pils
by
any
sordove
bjcp
standard
this
beer
is
so
darn
crisp
clean
and
hoppy
i
would
argue
it
stands
up
there
with
some
of
the
best
hoppy
beers
like
zombie
dust
and
pliny
d
light
dry
crisp
and
refreshingly
hoppy
this
is
a
very
drinkable
lager
and
one
i
order
whenever
available
i
will
say
this
has
been
more
on
par
with
sculpin
or
pliny
in
my
previous
experiences
found
it
to
be
a
little
less
vibrant
and
a
lot
more
floral
here
i
really
want
to
score
this
higher
perhaps
next
time
will
convince
me
o
finally
been
wanting
to
try
this
beer
for
a
long
time
and
it
was
great
a
super
drinkable
big
lager
bending
the
boundaries
between
an
ale
and
a
lager
overall
very
solid
beer
its
a
very
good
representation
of
the
style
the
brewery
is
trying
to
make
but
not
the
one
ba
classifies
it
as
even
though
i
went
to
beermongers
with
the
intention
of
having
this
one
beer
and
only
one
i
almost
had
another
a
bit
of
a
restrained
beer
from
the
bruery
its
in
that
hoppy
lager
vein
and
they
did
it
well
relatively
easy
to
knock
back
a
few
glasses
but
the
abv
creeps
up
quick
definitely
a
solid
summer
beer
glad
to
finally
try
this
one
thanks
eric
o
a
really
fine
brew
would
enjoy
this
anytime
worth
seeking
out
a
nice
beer
that
is
an
og
hoppy
lager
if
i
remember
correctly
enjoyable
to
drink
and
one
of
the
more
balancedinteresting
ipls
ive
had
hops
are
very
flavorful
but
not
overpowering
i
can
drink
this
all

overall
a
great
impressive
and
controlled
pilsner
with
a
real
pleasant
and
impressive
hop
profie
b
yep
o
i
really
liked
this
beer
a
whole
lot
super
drinkable
with
a
great
balance
between
the
hops
and
the
malt
profile
the
yeast
profile
was
assertive
enough
to
let
you
know
its
still
a
pilsner
which
was
great
o
overall
not
a
bad
beer
a
great
west
coast
ipa
lager
nut
truthfully
i
enjoy
jacks
abby
lagers
a
bit
more
o
a
wonderful
lager
with
diverse
hop
notes
which
is
both
refreshing
and
flavorful
making
for
an
easy
drinking
and
enjoyable
brew
would
reach
for
this
ahead
of
some
of
the
solid
west
coast
ipas
out
there
thanks
alex
not
sure
if
its
because
its
not
an
ale
but
this
beer
lacks
complexity
and
the
flavor
begins
to
weigh
heavily
after
while
still
a
hoppy
monster
though
and
was
glad
to
try
it
but
its
perhaps
a
bit
overrated
o
really
good
beer
the
hops
dominate
this
beer
and
its
really
intense
at
times
maybe
a
little
too
intense
for
my
personal
preference
however
if
i
were
in
the
mood
id
buy
this
beer
fairly
regularly
if
i
could
edit
2
the
batch
that
was
out
in
april
was
better
than
the
current
batch
available
now

this

the

sticky

the
aroma
smells
fresh
floral
piney
and
dank
with
bright
and
zesty
citrus
flavors
straight
up
the
nose
tropical
character
mixes
with
sweeter
bready
notes
to
give
this
a
ripe
flavorful
twang
in
the
nostrils
the
taste
matches
the
aroma
which
a
fresh
zesty
and
resinous
bitterness
that
lights
up
the
mouth
with
a
bright
feel
herbal
and
tropical
flavors
spread
out
mingling
with
the
honeyed
and
bready
sweetness
from
the
malts
man
this
is
just
juicy
feeling
across
the
back
before
things
finish
dry
and
piney
with
a
pithy
bitterness
that
sticks
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
crisp
and
tight
feel
that
is
undercut
by
a
creamy
slickness
that
has
this
just
moving
effortlessly
across
the
palate
overall
drinkability
is
impeccable
for
7
abv
with
this
tasting
like
a
fantastic
west
coast
dipa
and
drinking
like
a
super
smooth
pilsener
i
can
say
with
a
certain
degree
of
certainty
that
this
might
be
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
its
that
good
i
have
wanted
to
try
this
one
for
a
while
now
and
it
more
than
delivered
this
gets
my
highest
recommendation
medium
body
decent
carbonation
crisp
and
refreshing
on
the
tongue
despite
the
abv
i
could
easily
have
23
of
these
in
a
sitting
refreshing
flavorful
and
probably
the
best
imperial
pilsner
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
quaffing
oa
delicious
pilsener
that
has
many
ipalike
qualities
really
enjoyed
this
beer
lovely
take
on
the
quiet
pils
a
bit
of
a
schizo
of
a
beer
but
very
good
nonetheless
glad
i
got
to
try
it
i
admit
i
havent
had
many
ipls
but
this
was
no
champ
among
them

humulus

pale

is
an
accurate
descriptor
perhaps
more
accurate
would
to
call
this
a
hop
focused
o
a
fantastic
collaboration
between
half
acre
and
mikkeller
and
probably
one
of
the
better
nonstaple
beers
half
acre
has
churned
out
very
solid
for
the
warmer
months
as
this
is
quite
refreshing
i
wouldnt
change
a
thing
with
this
experiment
i
hope
they
can
revisit
this
on
occasion
as
it
is
definitely
one
to
seek
out
a
truly
unique
creation
and
one
of
my
favorite
collaboration
beers
to
date

getting
better

better

a

some

attempt

skirt
the
one
4pack
limit
on
this
one
wish
id
gotten
a
pint
rather
than
the
taster
o
better
than
i
would
have
thought
it
improves
on
reflection
o
probably
one
of
my
least
favorite
brews
from
duclaw
o
i
like
it
but
can
see
why
someone
wouldnt
the
lemon
is
a
bit
much
but
its
not
overly
hopped
and
gets
better
as
it
warms
recommended
o
imperial
pils
is
a
style
i
dont
really
get
i
loved
this
beer
in
part
because
it
hid
its
alcohol
so
well
so
why
not
have
a
regular
pils
and
a
safer
ride
home
on

the

the
day

well
poured
a

the
smell
was

a

great

around

a

at

you
almost

and
not

job
a
deceptively
drinkable

pils
maintains

character

has

pumpedup
as
it
should

with
a
thin
with
lace
head
sweater
then
any
imperial
pilsners
ive
had
in
this
country
smell
was
herbal
and
hop
the
taste
was
spicy
almost
an
orange
rind
and
cinnamon
taste
with
noticeable
hop
finish
felt
lite
bodied
on
the
tongue
but
bubbly
and
crisp
drinkable
is
one
way
i
could
describe
this
beer
as
it
goes
down
easy
and
begs
for
a
second
this
beer
is
exceptionally
drinkable
it
is
flavorful
and
smooth
without
any
of
the
alcohol
presence
you
expect
i
will
go
back
for
more
each
time
they

good

drinkability

but
a
decent
drinker
drinkability
the
pils
is
very
drinkable
wellbalanced
with
a
distinctive
hop
flavor
that
stands
out
nicely
it
was
served
a
light
gold
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
was
hops
over
malt
the
taste
was
quite
well
balanced
it
was
definately
hop
powered
but
with
just
enough
malt
to
make
it
go
the
feel
was
incredibly
clean
and
dry
with
a
sweet
alcohol
finish
expected
from
such
a
strong
beer
i
chose
this
because
i
couldnt
resist
trying
an
imperial
pilsner
i
was
ready
for
the
hops
but
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
the
great
blending
of
tastes
snake
oil
pours
a
vibrant
gold
colour
with
a
thick
pillowy
white
head
that
eventually
diminishes
but
never
seems
to
go
away
very
aromatic
with
scents
of
grass
and
flowers
the
flavours
are
biscuity
malt
yeast
and
a
clean
hop
finish
nice
delicate
mouthfeel
with
light
but
persistant
carbonation
excessively
drinkable
yum
this
is
duclaws
latest
seasonal
brought
home
a
growler
on
thursday
night
reviewing
it
on
sunday
pours
a
clear
light
gold
with
a
finger
of
white
head
and
some
decent
lacing
aroma
is
simple
grassy
hops
taste
brings
in
a
full
biscuity
malt
that
really
balances
well
with
the
assertive
hoppiness
really
smooth
rounded
flavor
beer
seems
a
little
undercarbonated
for
a
pilsner
and
while
i
would
usually
attribute
this
to
the
growler
i
had
the
same
thoughts
when
i
had
the
beer
directly
from
the
tap
overall
another
solid
seasonal
from
duclaw
not
the
best
ballast
point
has
to
offer
but
still
a
dang
good
beer
very
nice
ipl
there
are
better
ones
from
jacks
abby
but
this
is
very
good
i
enjoyed
this
beer
a
lot
the
hops
were
much
stronger
than
i
expected
i
enjoyed
the
subtle
fleeting
sweetness
in
the
aftertaste
pretty
dry
and
bitter
finish
but
it
worked
very
well
in
my
opinion
the
smell
was
pretty
thin
but
i
would
prefer
this
beer
over
most
lagers
an
interesting
take
on
a
style
i
have
had
limited
exposure
to
where
all
previous
versions
have
had
somewhat
similar
profiles
i
didnt
love
everything
about
this
brew
but
the
grand
total
has
it
as
one
to
have
again
this
is
an
easy
drinker
despite
its
7
0
abv
i
would
say
they
generally
achieved
their
goal
of
making
a
bottom
fermented
ipa
i
would
recommend
giving
it
a
try
love
this
beer
no
better
bomber
for
the
price
go
to
fave
the
pine
is
strong
in
this
one
there
is
a
hop
to
malt
ratio
of
about
6040
if
i
was
to
take
a
guess
the
citrus
and
pine
hops
lead
the
way
but
the
underlying
roasted
maltbread
character
can
also
be
found
lingering
bitterness
at
the
end
nicely
done
o
sneaky
seem
like
a
beer
you
could
drink
all
day
but
i
doubt
that
would
be
a
good
idea
i
really
like
what
ballast
point
makes
and
this
is
just
another
great
to
add
to
the
list
not
too
heavy
not
too
light
i
could
host
a
bbq
and
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
overall
a
rather
nice
and
tasty
ipl
with
a
nice
mix
of
tropical
fruits
bready
tastes
and
a
decent
hop
blend
a
rather
nice
drinking
ipl
overall
overall
i
wish
it
contained
a
bit
more
of
a
flavor
transition
toward
the
finish
but
a
good
beer
nonetheless
overall
fairly
good
though
it
is
probably
not
something
i
would
search
out
never
a
bad
choice
never
the
best
choice
good
all
around
22oz
into
pint
this
is
as
advertised
the
aroma
and
citruspine
elements
found
in
a
well
made
ipa
but
with
the
crisper
biscuity
malt
tones
and
mouthfeel
found
in
a
lager
my
first
hoppy
lager
so
i
have
little
to
go
on
did
indeed
enjoy
it
and
will
purchase
again
as
my
hop
addiction
has
me
having
a
difficult
time
making
a
true
foray
into
lagers
just
yet
overall
not
bad
at
all
but
it
drinks
like
a
hitest
beer
sweet
and
a
bit
alcoholey
as
the
style
tends
to
be
overall
not
bad
but
i
was
expecting
dissenter
so
i
was
a
little
let
down
really
liked
this
blend
of
ipa
and
lager
to
create
the
ipl
liked
better
than
then
plain
lager
or
ipa
worth
a
try
for
sure
o
didnt
really
have
high
expectations
for
this
one
given
the
style
and
that
this
bottle
is
less
than
fresh
but
i
have
to
say
i
was
quite
pleasantly
surprised
excellent
ipl
they
made
a
lager
to
be
much
more
fun
and
it
does
feel
cleaner
than
an
ipa
i
wonder
of
what
type
of
yeast
they
used
this
is
superbly
well
balanced
and
surprisingly
citrusy
they
really
managed
well
its
hop
profile
worth
it
trying
and
sure
i
wouldnt
mind
to
seek
it
again
easy
to
drink
light
malt
and
citrus
not
my
favorite
beer
i
liked
samuel
adams
ipl
but
this
missed
big
time
the
malt
character
truly
beat
the
hops
this
was
a
true
resin
filled
ipaipl
and
not
in
a
good
way
overall
this
was
disappointing
overall
all
in
all
an
interesting
and
nicely
done
brew
overall
one
of
the
better
ipls
ive
had
to
date
for
the
price
i
paid
its
well
worth
a
few
more
trips
into
the
fathom
this
is
a
crisp
beer
definitely
a
lager
or
pilsner
style
beer
color
is
light
copper
color
very
similar
to
yuengling
really
not
a
malt
bomb
but
not
really
hoppy
either
it
was
labeled
as
a
ipa
style
lager
i
dont
detect
that
much
hop
in
the
flavors
maybe
i
have
had
too
many
true
ipas
but
this
one
is
not
hoppy
at
all
it
is
very
much
a
lager
i
wont
go
through
a
full
review
i
will
say
that
its
a
decent
beer
but
like
so
many
craft
breweries
that
make
stuff
that
is
away
from
a
good
ipa
or
stout
that
they
are
known
for
it
just
is
not
worth
the
price
difference
when
you
can
get
a
12
pack
of
adjunct
lager
12
oz
cans
for
maybe
a
couple
of
bucks
more
like
i
said
this
beer
reminds
me
a
lot
of
yeungling
and
was
only
two
dollars
less
than
the
local
grocery
chain
has
a
12
pack
on
sale
for
this
week
poured
into
a
standard
pint
this
is
a
medium
amber
colored
beer
with
a
modest
head
the
nose
offers
plenty
of
hops
as
expected
but
also
a
nice
clean
malt
aroma
the
flavor
mirrors
this
with
a
great
balance
of
toasty
malt
and
sharp
bitter
hoppiness
very
drinkable
hoppy
malty
lager
like
a
hoppy
octoberfest
purchased
this
at
bevmo
in
a
22oz
bomber
and
am
anxious
to
try
it
poured
a
straw
gold
with
a
decent
head
the
aroma
is
a
combo
of
resinous
hops
and
sweet
malt
the
taste
is
a
replica
of
the
nose
but
the
flavors
are
a
bit
more
intense
than
the
aroma
would
suggestthe
piney
hops
flavor
was
most
prominent
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
that
there
was
a
good
malt
character
to
the
brew
the
finish
as
typical
with
lagers
was
very
clean
overall
it
was
a
flavorful
wellbalanced
brew
i
wish
i
could
find
a
sixpack
again
not
sure
if
the
ipl
style
is
a
common
offering
however
highly
recommend
those
who
like
ipas
pale
ales
seek
this
out
ballast
point
doesnt
disappoint
disclaimer
biased
towards
sd
beers
o
a
really
good
beer
a
lager
with
a
west
coast
ipa
taste
nicely
hopped
but
not
overpowering
ill
have
another
a
crisp
clean
strong
lager
nicely
hoppy
a
very
tasty
beer
that
is
all
ipa
except
using
slightly
cleaner
lager
yeast
that
imparts
less
fruit
esters
and
complexities
still
very
doughy
and
sweet
the
hops
completely
carry
this
beer
on
its
shoulders
into
a
good
level
ooverall
an
idea
to
have
a
clean
version
of
ipa
that
makes
you
have
more
o
i
guess
i
prefer
ipas
if
this
were
top
fermented
i
think
it
would
have
been
an
a
or
an
a
overall
though
it
was
decent
i
can
kind
of
see
why
the
style
is
growing
in
popularity
but
im
not
into
it
just
yet
would
buy
again
and
serve
to
friends
o
was
expecting
something
boring
but
this
is
an
excellent
beer
and
i
will
be
buying
it
again
o
while
i
personally
love
hops
i
hate
overly
bitter
beers
this
gives
me
the
best
of
both
worlds
its
a
hoppy
beer
for
sure
and
i
really
enjoy
it
the
cost
point
is
outstanding
at
4
99
a
bomber
its
not
the
easiest
beer
to
find
ive
had
it
both
on
tap
and
in
the
bottle
and
have
never
been
disappointed
this
is
a
my
second
ipl
and
this
has
changed
my
view
of
what
the
style
can
be
great
offering
by
ballast
point
o
overall
a
delightful
beer
very
much
like
an
ipa
this
is
a
great
twist
pours
from
the
tapas
nice
golden
amber
with
a
lacy
head
that
dissipates
somewhat
quickly
smells
floral
and
citrusy
with
pine
notes
tastes
of
grapefruit
pith
a
bit
of
salt
and
some
bell
pepper
finishes
cleaner
than
most
ipas
with
only
a
little
stickiness
and
a
creamy
citrus
aftertaste
b
i
like
this
beer
way
more
than
the
avg
rating
im
blown
away
by
the
abu
dant
clean
hop
profiles
accompanied
by
the
pilsner
like
body
nailed
it
o
this
is
my
first
ipl
after
drinking
i
can
understand
why
this
style
is
on
the
rise
the
lager
qualities
harmonize
with
the
hops
to
cut
some
bitterness
and
provide
an
extremely
refreshing
clean
crisp
and
juicy
beer
definitely
would
recommend
o
more
of
a
lager
than
an
ipa
would
have
liked
to
see
the
hops
being
more
present
and
pronounced
maybe
a
wethopped
variant
o
malt
character
is
very
sweet
crisp
and
clean
hops
are
very
aggressive
and
quite
bitter
o
a
great
ipl
never
had
one
of
this
style
but
enjoy
it
great
summer
brew
i
would
imagine
though
its
january
and
its
still
great
overall
i
have
been
spoiled
by
jacks
abby
and
while
this
is
good
it
is
nowhere
close
90100
o
i
liked
this
lager
because
it
showcased
the
citrusy
flavors
of
the
hops
but
wasnt
that
bitter
and
didnt
have
the
bite
or
crispness
you
get
from
ales
as
such
it
has
good
drinkability
o
not
bad
but
inferior
to
several
other
socalled
ipls
ive
had
lately
its
lacking
a
big
enough
hop
punch
and
the
body
seems
thin
still
nothing
id
council
someone
to
avoid
particularly
rather
one
to
check
off
the
list
and
move
on
yellow
amber
color
with
a
very
good
sized
off
white
head
that
recedes
away
steady
streams
of
carbonation
and
thin
lacing
on
the
glass
awesome
smell
to
this
beer
very
hop
forward
aroma
sweet
delicious
citrus
and
pine
resin
just
the
slightest
bit
of
pale
malt
coming
through
as
it
warmed
but
i
am
comfortable
saying
this
brew
basically
smells
of
nothing
but
sweet
delicious
hops
hell
yeah
the
taste
of
this
beer
is
also
very
hoppy
piney
and
grassy
characteristics
with
a
good
amount
of
hop
bitterness
this
is
quite
a
tasty
brew
but
it
is
not
particularly
balanced
there
is
not
enough
malt
backbone
to
support
the
intense
hop
presence
in
this
beer
that
being
said
that
is
kind
of
the
point
of
this
beer
to
showcase
the
hops
on
a
clean
base
that
you
dont
really
notice
in
this
sense
they
succeeded
but
the
whole
idea
is
fundamentally
flawed
however
i
personally
prefer
beers
that
are
overly
hoppy
as
opposed
to
overly
malty
so
i
dont
really
mind
that
this
beer
is
unbalanced
and
this
is
a
flaw
that
is
in
someways
appealing
and
it
sets
this
beer
apart
overall
this
is
not
a
ballast
point
masterpiece
but
it
is
damn
good
absolutely
something
to
check
out
if
you
like
hops
and
like
ipas
that
arent
too
malty
i
will
buy
this
brew
again
a
little
disappointed
with
this
one
the
aroma
is
the
best
factor
mostly
because
it
reminds
me
of
campari
i
like
it
more
with
each
sip
and
am
surprised
it
is
even
close
to
7
it
drinks
so
smoothly
and
is
very
crisp
delivers
nice
hops
but
doesnt
try
too
hard
very
clean
base
the
cleanest
tastiest
example
ive
had
of
this
stuff
thus
far
can
raul
get
a
yeah
buddy
overall
a
nice
and
hoppy
lager
with
some
bitterness
in
the
end
ipl
are
becoming
more
popular
with
myself
more
and
more
o
i
wonder
what
the
hop
bill
on
this
bad
boy
is
it
reminds
me
a
lot
of
stone
17th
anniversary
like
a
lot
still
this
one
could
use
some
cleaning
out
reminds
me
too
much
of
an
ale
and
misses
on
the
cleanrefreshing
side
taste
starts
with
crisp
bitter
floral
hops
and
grass
then
bread
orange
and
pine
has
a
very
floral
earthy
piney
and
minty
finish
with
a
bit
of
orange
and
straw
has
average
body
with
a
bit
of
chewiness
above
average
carbonation
very
creamy
and
bready
o
great
brew
from
ballast
point
crisp
and
refreshing
perfect
for
a
summer
day
more
ale
like
but
still
has
that
lager
finish
excellent
version
of
the
style
another
pleasing
brew
from
ballast
point
really
really
good
bitterness
isnt
that
of
an
ipa
but
hop
flavors
is
beautiful
ipa
hop
flavors
with
incredibly
clean
attributes
a
crisp
solid
and
grainy
malt
bill
sweet
dry
cereal
grains
up
front
followed
by
the
faintest
note
of
underlying
fruitiness
big
tropical
fruit
hop
punch
citrus
and
grapefruit
touch
of
pineapple
with
a
bit
of
pine
finishes
super
clean
with
a
resinous
and
drying
bitterness
medium
bodied
with
brisk
carbonation
this
beer
should
be
the
epitome
of
this
newly
popular
style
delicious
clean
solid
malt
bright
hop
and
balanced
with
lingering
bitterness
overall
ok
but
do
much
for
me
pretty
much
no
lager
character
either
medium
in
body
with
high
carbonation
creamy
mouthfeel
with
a
dry

poured
from

into

the

the

the

plays
a

i
really
liked
this
hopped
lagerit
actually
seems
bigger
than
what
it
is
odgood
not
great
especially
when
jacks
abby
ipls
are
constantly
sitting
on
the
shelf
for
me
at
a
fear
better
price
point
for
a
noticeably
tastier
product
32oz
mini
growler
filled
at
top
hops
in
nyc
pours
a
translucent
orangey
honey
color
with
almost
no
head
good
amount
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
sweet
with
some
citrus
and
tropical
fruits
as
well
as
some
grassy
notes
pineapple
tangerine
and
sweet
grapefruit
some
breadiness
a
lot
going
on
in
the
nose
the
taste
is
more
of
the
pineapple
tangerine
and
grapefruit
honey
sweet
with
some
floral
hop
notes
near
the
end
hints
of
grass
with
malt
throughout
fair
amount
of
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
light
and
crisp
overall
a
pretty
interesting
beer
well
excuted
hope
to
have
it
again
the
body
was
medium
and
had
a
bitter
finish
that
lingered
for
a
bit
drinkability
was
ok
the
beer
went
down
easily
enough
but
didnt
really
have
a
noticeable
personality
overall
a
pleasant
enough
little
brew
probably
worth
a
shot
if
you
see
it
overall
gorgeous
lace
terrible
beer
was
back
and
forth
between
a
3
50
and
3
75
overall
but
i
guess
i
was
feeling
gracious
decent
drinkable
but
unremarkable
when
i
heard
they
were
bottling
this
i
was
expecting
more
but
i
may
have
had
too
high
of
expectations
im
assuming
they
accomplished
the
flavor
profile
they
were
looking
for
theres
nothing
offputting
in
this
pint
but
i
think
i
need
more
ipls
before
i
can
be
as
objectively
critical
as
i
should
categories
aside
the
beer
in
itself
is
ok
better
than
average
but
nothing
i
would
chase
down
this
beer
is
pretty
boring
i
give
is
credit
for
being
refreshing
in
the
summer
but
just
not
a
lot
of
character
all
the
way
around
from
nose
taste
mouth
not
to
impressed
ballast
point
is
a
great
brewery
so
i
am
glad
they
dont
bottle
this
one
i
have
been
pouring
it
at
the
shop
on
tap
for
drinkers
that
come
in
looking
for
something
generic
like
blue
moon
or
bud
light
it
seems
to
go
good
for
them
for
a
heavy
beer
guy
i
would
really
stay
away
taste
very
clean
and
light
to
medium
body
i
love
it
great
citrusy
hop
flavor
with
a
balanced
malt
and
bitterness
that
doesnt
linger
all
around
just
good
od
weaker
for
the
style
missing
that
strong
delicious
noble
hop
profile
tastes
good
but
just
didnt
want
more
of
this
interpretation
of
the
style
overall
this
is
what
lagersimperial
pilsners
should
taste
like
not
sure
ive
ever
had
an
imperial
pilsner
that
balanced
the
enjoyable
characteristics
of
a
lager
with
an
india
pale
ale
this
successfully
just
a
delicious
refreshing
beer
d
a
fun
try
overall
one
of
my
favorites
from
ballast
point
and
i
truly
wait
for
this
one
to
pop
up
infrequently
throughout
the
year
just
went
on
tap
yesterday
at
ballast
point
so
i
swooped
this
up
today
and
it
never
disappoints
i
love
traditional
czech
pilsners
and
cali
style
ipas
and
this
has
the
both
of
best
worlds
in
every
aspect
cheers
had
this
at
the
public
house
in
san
francisco
while
at
the
giants
game
this
beer
saw
the
first
pitch
really
cool
tastes
slightly
hoppy
but
its
pretty
balanced
overall
definitely
has
a
pilsnerlager
finish
to
it
pilsners
and
lagers
are
styles
i
have
stayed
away
from
with
craft
beerbut
this
wasnt
too
bad
pours
a
clear
orange
with
an
offwhite
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
a
nice
latticework
of
lace
forms
on
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
and
herbal
and
citrus
zest
hops
taste
is
of
herbal
and
citrus
zest
hops
up
front
with
a
nice
malt
backbone
there
is
a
mild
bitterness
on
the
palate
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
an
clean
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
with
a
nice
hop
presence
pours
a
golden
color
a
little
paler
than
an
ipa
had
a
nice
strong
head
the
nose
is
a
lot
of
floral
hops
with
no
to
little
malt
the
taste
is
great
it
is
a
little
lighter
in
maltiness
than
an
ipa
very
slight
buttery
has
a
great
smoothness
in
the
mouthfeel
that
i
thought
complimented
the
hops
very
well
i
was
glad
i
ordered
this
i
drank
it
while
watching
an
evening
football
game
i
can
see
doing
this
a
lot
and
ordering
numerous
of
these
in
an
evening
i
cant
believe
the
overall
rating
for
this
beer
i
would
take
this
any
day
over
sculpin
maybe
i
just
had
a
good
batch
this
beer
is
incredible
ipls
might
be
the
next
new
craze
o
overall
i
liked
this
beer
while
its
a
style
i
dont
quite
see
why
its
around
its
a
good
beer
like
an
ipa
except
different
woth
trying
if
you
see
it
ever
gotta
say
it
has
been
a
while
since
i
have
had
this
brew
and
it
did
seem
different
to
me
this
go
around
but
it
is
always
a
favorite
of
mine
i
personally
just
really
like
the
idea
of
india
pale
lagers
the
lager
yeast
allows
for
a
much
cleaner
hop
profile
delivery
imo
i
wish
more
breweries
would
take
on
this
style
definitely
need
to
make
a
point
of
seeking
out
more
ipls
nice
enough
i
recall
liking
this
a
little
more
when
i
first
tasted
it
though
o
great
style
compared
to
an
ipa
hard
to
get
close
to
an
ipa
and
be
different
i
like
a
beer
that
creates
some
headscratching
as
to
style
good
to
remember
that
the
creative
urge
challenges
the
artificial
boundaries
call
it
a
lowvoltage
dipa
but
for
hopheads
i
think
it
would
be
worth
tasting
as
a
highly
drinkable
novelty
fresh
batch
tapped
yesterday
and
enjoyed
today
at
old
grove
outstanding
beer
and
really
nice
batch
5
to
mouthfeel
i
dont
understand
why
breweries
continue
to
make
imperial
pilsners
it
is
just
an
oxymoron
imo
this
is
really
not
bad
though
just
a
bit
of
overkill
tone
it
down
a
bit
and
this
is
a
really
good
lager
as
is
not
something
i
really
enjoy
a
nice
try
at
an
emerging
style
but
a
let
down
especially
with
everything
else
they
brew
if
you
can
find
it
try
it
dan
interesting
and
well
made
brew
from
ballast
point
for
sure
i
like
and
appreciate
the
effort
of
this
rather
rarely
done
hybrid
style
but
i
didnt
love
it
an
easy
to
drink
and
enjoyable
beer
but
not
overly
memorable
another
very
good
beer
from
ballast
point
it
isnt
on
the
same
level
as
big
eye
which
is
much
bigger
and
fuller
an
imperial
however
this
is
quite
good
and
well
worth
a
go
d
wow
this
one
was
very
easy
to
drink
my
first
one
went
down
rather
quickly
i
allowed
the
second
one
to
warm
up
and
thats
when
i
found
the
lager
characteristics
coming
out
i
love
the
fresh
juicy
sweet
tropical
fruit
flavors
from
the
hops
id
like
to
see
more
hoppy
lagers
or
pilsners
had
on
tap
at
ballast
point
taproom
in
san
diego
this
is
my
first
ipl
pours
a
golden
yellow
with
a
moderate
white
head
smell
is
strange
the
hops
are
there
as
well
as
a
funky
yeast
taste
is
challenging
for
me
some
mild
hop
bitterness
up
front
then
a
wash
of
diacetyl
and
buttery
yeast
flavors
aftertaste
is
pretty
dry
but
something
sticks
around
longer
than
is
welcome
mouthfeel
is
medium
not
into
it
d
i
wish
i
could
get
more
taste
but
its
definitely
drinkable
it
might
be
a
good
beer
to
try
and
switch
people
from
bmc
to
ales
dnot
a
bad
brew
not
sure
i
get
a
pils
feel
to
it
drinkability
is
pretty
much
off
the
scales
its
super
refreshing
and
finishes
super
super
dry
which
beckons
you
to
sip
more
i
dusted
it
off
ridiculously
quick
and
could
have
had
much
more
super
approachable
as
long
as
you
like
hoppy
beers
already
poured
a
nice
golden
color
at
the
lighter
end
of
the
spectrum
but
well
within
a
lagers
range
a
nice
white
head
on
it
smell
is
strong
with
hopslots
of
pine
and
a
bit
of
backing
citrus
and
floral
taste
was
nice
and
resiny
with
little
malt
backing
we
had
a
few
ipls
on
the
trip
and
this
one
was
right
up
there
with
humulus
from
the
bruery
nice
mouthfeel
and
fantastic
drinkability
this
is
an
emerging
style
id
like
to
see
more
of
and
ballast
point
has
absolutely
nailed
it
draught
at
the
brewery
orange
tinted
gold
color
with
a
lasting
white
head
lots
of
hops
in
the
aroma
with
flowers
mangos
and
peaches
adding
fruit
to
the
spicy
and
grassy
notes
that
some
more
euro
hops
seem
to
be
adding
the
flavor
has
some
light
and
toasty
malt
with
lots
of
hop
flavor
mango
peach
grapefruit
peel
and
more
bitterness
than
the
sculpin
that
i
had
right
before
medium
bodied
with
smooth
carbonation
cool
mix
of
fruity
with
grassy
and
spicy
hops
id
definitely
like
to
have
this
one
again
very
nicely
done
version
of
this
style
that
packed
a
ton
of
juicy
hop
flavor
into
a
firm
crisp
and
most
of
all
extremely
easy
drinking
package
i
literall
could
have
just
stood
around
and
drank
this
all
day
but
other
beers
beckoned
d
very
high
this
is
higher
in
alcohol
but
only
feeling
it
rather
than
tasting
it
only
lower

due
to
alcohol

d
an
interesting
beer
from

but
id
take
their
regular
ipa
over
this
any
day
congratulations
ballast

on
brewing
this
masterpeice
regal
pilsner
pours
brilliant
gold
with
a

frothy
persistent
white
head
that
produces
excellent
lace
there
are
no
big
no
hop
aromas
on
the
nose

season
the
rich
fresh
baked
bread
aromas
malty
sweetness
initiates
the
palate
with
a
definite
lemony
citrus
hop
presence
excellent
lacing
it
has
medium
to
medium
full
body
not
quite
chewy
and
has
a
smooth
creamy
texture
well
balanced
drinkable
and
repeatable
very
yummy
heavy
wheat
flavor
also
remember
its
a
lager
regal
lager
not
just
a
good
beer
but
also
a
palindrome
now
i
have
passed
this
thing
over
in
stores
for
years
but
finally
i
grabbed
a
single
and
i
think
it
was
a
great
buy
its
only
7
abv
which
makes
it
drinkable
and
light
for
any
type
of
imperial
but
its
still
quite
hoppy
and
bitter
and
the
german
type
pils
malts
are
huge
in
the
flavor
while
its
still
dry
and
clean
drinking
very
well
mad
obviously
and
while
its
by
far
not
my
favorite
breck
beer
i
have
to
appreciate
that
a
beer
this
simple
is
so
good
its
gorgeous
in
the
glass
with
a
big
tall
white
head
and
a
hoppy
nose
vegetal
there
and
fresh
and
green
its
new
and
excited
and
i
like
the
virgin
nature
it
hits
the
palate
with
carbonation
is
at
war
with
the
flavors
though
its
almost
too
bubbly
and
this
is
the
only
style
it
could
ever
work
with
but
work
it
does
and
i
appreciate
a
blue
collar
mouthfeel
as
much
as
anything
else
its
still
a
pilsener
though
and
i
will
never
get
off
on
one
but
i
like
it
for
what
it
is
and
i
am
sorry
i
waited
so
long
to
indulge
its
well
worth
the
few
bucks
i
paid
for
the
single
and
i
may
even
drink
this
one
again
some
day
breck
has
come
a
long
way
lately
i
think
and
maybe
i
have
been
behind
the
times
on
some
of
the
beers
but
this
is
very
good
cheers
everything
i
dislike
about
the
style
adjunct
aroma
and
flavor
overly
sweet
with
an
amplified
lager
character
finish
is
overly
bitter
love
these
american
craft
pilsners
nice
job

not
regal
but
not
a
peasant
either
its
maltydry
finish
carries
a
modest
warmth
but
its
the
tale
of
those
spicy
hop
bitternesses
that
carry
the
late
palate
into
a
crisp
and
refreshing
closure
shying
away
from
the
rougher
alcohols
or
maltier
weight
the
dry
finish
still
remembers
its
base
lager
flavor
rather
than
imperial
pilsner
i
prefer
to
see
this
lager
as
a
firm
oktoberfest
with
the
soul
of
structure
of
german
lager
overall
a
little
big
for
sessioning
but
a
very
tasty
double
pils
easy
to
drink
and
enjoyable
sweeter
than
i
was
expecting
but
doesnt
ruin
the
experience
worth
consideration
but
nothing
i
would
regularly
seek
out
o
overall
a
good
flowery
hop
level
nice
pilsner
grain
base
the
more
you
drink
the
more
you
appreciate
definitly
worth
a
drink
worthy
of
repeat
a
2x
pilsner
with
extra
incentive
overall
i
guess
this
beer
is
ok
the
abv
is
well
hidden
but
it
doesnt
have
the
snappy
hop
profile
it
suggests
on
the
label
not
going
to
pick
it
up
again
interesting
not
my
fave
double
pils
by
a
longshot
but
not
a
bad
beer
a
nice
option
if
you
see
it
on

the

that
is

alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
with
minimal
warming
present
after
the
finish
overall
this
is
a
nice
imperial
pils
all
around
well
balanced
hop
malt
and
yeast
flavors
and
very
smooth
and
crisp
to
drink
a
nicely
enjoyable
offering
decent
pils
kind
of
a
grain
thing
on
the
nose
flavor
is
kind
of
clogged
and
thick
doesnt
really
shine
as
sharply
as
id
want
its
just
there
really
definitely
could
use
a
sharper
character
profile
serving
type
bottle
the
taste
is
very
hoppy
it
has
a
bitterness
and
hoppy
piney
taste
but
it
is
unique
it
has
a
great
hoppy
bitterness
that
stays
on
the
tongue
long
after
it
is
gone
down
the
hatch
overall
this
is
a
big
win
and
a
brew
i
would
buy
again
when
i
wanted
a
big
or
just
goodsized
beer
o
overall
an
easy
drinking
imperial
pilsner
nothing
done
over
the
top
either
just
a
crisp
enjoyable
take
on
the
style
overall
way
off
the
mark
for
an
imperial
pils
both
in
the
sweetness
and
in
the
hop
profile
but
still
rather
enjoyable
to
drink
more
round
than
crisp
particularly
for
a
pilsner
the
malt
is
rich
as
is
the
body
which
belies
the
style
still
it
holds
its
own
with
spicy
bbq
food
the
hop
is
stronger
than
the
smell
suggests
making
this
a
wellbalanced
profile
very
clean
the
beer
is
lighter
golden
in
color
with
a
head
that
sports
middle
of
the
pack
retention
and
spots
of
lace
around
the
glass
its
nose
is
respectable
too
with
notes
of
lemon
and
grassy
aroma
and
a
touch
of
biscuit
then
i
was
in
for
a
little
surprise
with
the
nose
well
relative
to
what
i
was
anticipating
not
knowing
what
the
abv
was
it
tasted
like
a
good
pilsner
without
a
kick
of
alcohol
biscuity
and
lemongrass
flavors
and
some
notes
of
simple
crisp
hops
make
this
pilsner
worth
a
go
and
thats
before
we
had
in
a
body
which
is
a
lighter
medium
with
agreeable
carbonation
and
one
thats
easy
to
drink
despite
the
alcohol
i
dont
normally
understand
the
concept
of
taking
pilsners
to
a
higher
alcohol
but
i
think
breckenridge
has
done
well
here
o
an
ok
beer
worth
buying
a
single
but
not
a
sixer
o
very
nice
double
pilsner
here
everything
balances
out
nicely
and
nothing
takes
over
on
the
tongue
very
good
brew
here
this
beer
was
better
than
i
expected
on
par
with
the
quality
put
out
by
breckenridge
the
most
notable
part
of
this
beer
in
my
opinion
was
the
delicate
floral
flavor
at
the
end
of
each
sip
the
alcohol
also
made
itself
known
in
a
favorable
way
nice
offering
will
try
again
o
overall
not
a
fan
of
this
one
at
all
the
taste
is
just
a
mess
in
my
opinion
d
too
many
negatives
on
the
palate
to
really
find
this
enjoyable
or
worth
recommending
the
metallic
flavor
is
rather
prevalent
and
therefore
offputting
pass
o
pretty
good
double
pilsner
somehow
it
came
off
to
me
as
a
milder
ipa
but
all
the
flavours
came
together
well
would
go
good
with
some
spicy
food
overall
this
is
a
solid
double
pilsner
that
fits
in
with
what
breckenridge
does
pours
a
honey
golden
color
that
is
appetizing
with
medium
width
head
nose
is
certainly
well
within
bock
territory
nice
and
breadymalty
with
some
hop
zing
in
there
too
palate
offers
a
big
hearty
malt
profile
light
hopping
to
balance
it
some
and
is
very
drinkable
a
little
boozy
but
still
very
drinkable
i
can
sense
kingliness
whilst
in
this
beers
presence
not
sure
why
though
it
pours
a
clear
golden
straw
topped
by
a
finger
of
white
foam
the
nose
is
kinda
plain
comprising
sweet
flowers
and
grass
with
a
touch
of
white
bread
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
along
with
a
vague
sweetness
and
some
menthol
things
dont
quite
sit
on
my
tongue
all
that
well
frankly
what
with
this
strange
twang
tossed
in
there
at
what
i
hope
to
be
the
last
minute
the
body
is
a
lightleaning
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
slightly
drying
finish
overall
a
pils
thats
a
touch
too
thick
and
heavy
one
with
an
odd
flavor
and
one
that
certainly
aint
worth
the
cost
frankly
not
a
fan
overall
an
unusual
and
interesting
beer
however
the
flavor
is
a
little
muddy
hops
are
strong
pungent
and
spicy
flavor
is
sweet
biscuitlike
with
a
distinct
malt
backbone
mixed
with
a
hops
bitter
finish
hopping
is
unique
almost
a
hopburst
character
that
is
both
bitter
and
floral
at
the
same
time
with
a
short
noble
hops
bitter
finish
a
good
beer
overall
but
the
price
was
steep
by
comparison
has
some
of
the
characteristics
of
victory
prima
pils
but
finishes
sweeter
and
not
as
complex
in
the
hops
finish
id
order
it
again
and
buy
it
again
but
its
not
my
goto
pils
flavor
has
a
touch
of
light
sweetness
almost
honeylike
it
has
a
little
crackery
malt
as
well
hopping
is
interesting
at
it
has
both
some
bitter
pithy
qualities
as
well
as
some
grassy
spicy
almost
pepperlike
notes
rindy
bitterness
lingers
a
short
spell
before
fading
overall
not
bad
id
have
this
again
though
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
it
prosit
1413
poured
into
a
standard
pint
glass
pours
a
light
carrot
orange
or
a
hazy
light
copper
color
a
light
cream
sudsy
head
sits
on
top
for
a
few
moments
then
dissipates
to
a
wisp
of
bubbles
some
sticky
lacing
smells
bright
and
slightly
hoppy
a
hint
of
a
grassy
presence
this
beer
tastes
really
clean
for
a
7
abv
beer
hint
of
hops
grass
and
citrus
with
a
malty
undertone
makes
this
beer
finish
clean
the
mouthfeel
is
just
about
right
overall
a
clean
bright
pilsner
that
goes
down
smooth
but
the
7
abv
can
sneak
up
on
you
the
beer
is
not
boozy
at
all
another
great
offering
from
breckenridge
this
poured
out
as
a
nice
looking
clear
yellowish
gold
color
with
a
soapy
looking
white
head
on
top
the
smell
of
the
beer
wasnt
too
grassy
which
i
liked
there
was
a
good
amount
of
earth
malts
and
some
nice
grainy
aromas
too
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
pretty
good
its
got
a
nice
crisp
bitter
flavor
with
a
light
sweetness
up
front
the
mouthfeel
is
a
light
and
very
drinkable
overall
this
brew
is
pretty
good
i
could
see
someone
drinking
quite
a
few
of
these
in
a
short
period
of
time
overall
just
an
ok
pilsner
not
too
keen
on
the
boozy
and
spiciness
to
it
whoa
that
aftertaste
really
doesnt
work
for
me
ive
had
worse
but
this
is
far
from
the
best
the
palate
opens
with
a
blend
of
the
grainy
and
cereal
malt
character
with
the
resiny
and
pungent
hops
moderately
floral
though
not
necessarily
bright
to
me
the
floral
character
from
say
centennials
are
bright
while
the
americanized
old
world
hops
are
more
pungent
and
snappy
the
hops
are
quite
enjoyable
the
midpalate
has
a
moderate
malt
sweetness
with
some
honey
and
graham
crackers
the
sweetness
increases
as
this
beer
warms
up
making
it
less
pleasant
mildly
metallic
and
minerallike
on
the
finish
the
combination
of
pungent
hop
resins
grainy
malt
sweetness
and
the
mineral
character
isnt
entirely
pleasant
an
occasional
wisp
of
alcohol
is
also
noticeable
medium
in
body
with
moderate
carbonation
this
beer
is
decent
i
doubt
ill
go
out
of
my
way
to
drink
it
again
but
if
proffered
a
fresh
pour
i
will
imbibe
light
bodied
with
good
carbonation
goes
down
smooth
im
not
a
pils
fan
but
this
one
wasnt
too
shabby
wouldnt
have
again
but
a
good
one
to
try
once
pours
a
clear
gold
color
14
inch
head
of
a
white
color
good
retention
and
good
lacing
smells
of
alcohol
sweet

slight
pale

yeast
and
slight
hop
fits
the
style
of
an
american
double
imperial
pilsner
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
clean
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
sweet
malt
alcohol
citrus

and
slight
pale

well
blended

appearance
and

a

plus
of

that
quickly

lacing
was
pretty
nice
throughout
couldnt
really
pick
up
anything
on
the
nose
taste
sweet
thats
the
main
description
honey
some
malt
sweetness
no
hop
bitterness
to
finish
left
some
kind
of
aftertaste
i
wasnt
too
fond
of
i
think
ill
pass
on
this
one
if
offered
up
to
me
i
definitely
wont
be
purchasing
it
again
too
sweet
no
crispness
that
i
like
in
a
pilsner
up
for
review
is
a
12oz
bottle
of
regal
pilsner
poured
into
a
pint
glass
golden
brown
with
a
beige
head
pilsner
malts
and
soem
hops
taste
is
quite
malty
for
a
pilsner
body
a
bit
thick
but
drinks
pretty
well
more
of
a
big
american
strong
pale
ale
than
a
double
pils
though
poured
from
a
bottle
into
an
umphreys
mcgee
pint
glass
clear
golden
honey
color
with
a
thin
wispy
layer
of
white
head
that
leaves
some
streaky
lacing
before
disappearing
almost
completely
aroma
is
light
of
pale
malts
grains
and
grass
taste
is
similar
bready
light
malt
sweetness
grains
grass
a
touch
of
citrus
zest
with
a
decent
balance
of
malts
and
hops
smooth
light
mouthfeel
and
easily
drinkable
its
not
often
i
find
a
pils
that
i
like
thanks
but
i
believe
ill
pass
on
this
one
this
is
not
what
i
want
from
my
pilsners
guessing
that
this
would
be
better
totally
fresh
and
on
tap
overall
this
is
run
of
mill
for
the
style
not
impressed
would
love
to
try
a
fresher
sample
i
believe
the
hops
are
tired
in
this
bottle
o
needs
a
little
more
carbonation
in
it
goes
down
smooth
not
bad
drinkability
i
could
easily
drink
several
of
these
in
a
session
good
drinkability
well
balanced
overall
drinkability
ok
but
not
my
favorite
too
much
of
a
alelager
hybrid
i
want
clean
crisp
refreshing
from
my
pilsener
this
was
too
much
like
drinking
an
ipa
but
not
as
good
as
a
standard
ipa
good
as
far
as
the
style
but
not
something
ill
be
looking
for
pours
a
pale
golden
body
with
a
light
off
white
head
billowing
nicely
above
the
rim
of
my
glass
with
fine
even
lacing
aromatics
contain
pale
cereal
malts
where
are
the
hops
well
they
are
here
but
not
like
other
imperial
pils
a
bit
of
citrus
grassiness
but
the
malts
shine
out
a
bit
brighter
here
in
the
hop
profile
flavor
has
mineral
water
harshness
with
a
touch
of
cereal
grains
light
citric
hops
really
coatas
the
palate
with
a
nice
rolling
biscuit
malt
sweetness
with
minimal
alcohol
showing
up
on
the
palate
just
enough
herbalcitrichops
to
balance
really
one
of
the
better
offerings
ive
had
from
breckenridge
mouthfeel
has
a
nice
full
on
creamyairy
carbonation
going
down
smooth
with
each
sip
leaving
behind
a
faint
hop
bitterness
with
streaks
of
hop
oils
evident
drinkability
is
solid
i
was
surprised
at
how
well
this
bigger
pils
drank
and
the
lack
of
extreme
alcohol
and
hop
bitterness
compared
to
what
i
have
come
to
expect
with
this
style
i
really
liked
the
bottle
on
this
one
as
well
super
creative
well
executed
i
hope
this
one
makes
it
back
in
2011
if
you
couldnt
tell
this
review
is
from
notes
when
it
was
last
released
d
this
beer
is
a
step
up
from
a
normal
pilsner
but
i
would
not
go
as
far
as
saying
its
an
imperial
pilsner
a
decent
beer
but
there
was
something
missing
for
me
maybe
it
was
the
imperial
part
d
a
pretty
good
imperial
pilsner
which
puts
malt
qualities
up
front
and
thankfully
leaves
the
alcohol
behind
it
has
some
flaws
but
not
a
bad
brew
nothing
really
stands
out
with
this
imperial
pilsner
from
breckenridge
this
started
out
good
i
really
enjoyed
the
nose
though
it
did
not
hold
up
after
that
overall
another
sub
standard
beer
from
breckenridge
not
to
mention
i
think
this
is
a
bastard
style
this
beer
would
be
wonderful
on
draft
but
i
highly
recommend
the
bottled
as
well
awesome
packaging
too
if
i
might
add
d
personally
like
this
pils
mainly
because
its
simple
yet
complex
part
of
breckenridges
small
batch
series
bright
rich
golden
in
color
crowned
with
a
creamy
white
foam
head
with
legs
big
hop
nose
thats
a
bit
resiny
and
dank
some
grass
and
hay
too
super
smooth
and
creamy
with
a
slightly
viscous
and
chewy
body
malty
up
front
with
fresh
sweet
grains
and
a
touch
of
honey
fresh
juicy
apples
spicy
hops
with
floral
some
mild
grapefruit
resiny
herbal
hits
and
grass
mild
astringency
and
a
bonedry
finish
overall
one
of
the
more
drinkable
double
pils
available
less
about
heat
alcohol
more
about
balance
and
flavor
i
poured
this
average
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
45
degrees
the
beer
was
a
nice
golden
color
the
beer
smelled
hoppy
and
also
tasted
pretty
hoppy
there
was
nothing
special
about
this
beer
and
nothing
terrible
but
i
will
have
to
say
because
of
the
hoppy
tast
i
will
not
buy
again
if
you
like
a
strong
ipa
then
maybe
you
will
like
it
this
beer
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
slight
haze
the
head
is
a
quarter
inch
in
height
and
recedes
very
quickly
into
nothing
the
aroma
is
of
faint
bready
malt
the
taste
has
a
the
same
bready
malt
and
a
little
bit
of
noble
hops
it
is
still
faint
for
a
beer
of
its
strength
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
carbonation
that
is
way
too
low
for
a
pilsener
overall
this
is
a
really
bad
beer
that
i
will
not
be
drinking
again
the
imperial
pilsner
is
a
different
style
to
brew
and
while
this
certainly
isnt
a
perfect
example
its
definitely
a
good
one
quite
drinkable
drinkability
is
good
an
enjoyable
enough
brew
not
something
i
would
really
repeat
purchase
now
that
its
winter
make
a
nice
tasty

again
its
a
departure
from
the

of
a

something
i
understand
because
its
not
the

style
this
is
a
tad
cloying
through
its
not
offensive
in
any
way
the
hops
have
good

the

d
feels

it
would
be
much
more
interesting
if
they
cranked
up
the

notes
a
little
strange
tasting
beer
it
is
different
from
a
pilsner
in
taste
not
a
big
fan
of
the
way
the
apple
comes
out
and
a
little
sweet
not
necessarily
in
a
nice
sweet
bready
malt
way
that
some
of
the
great
pilsners
pull
off
probably
not
worth
the
price
to
get
this
even
though
it
isnt
a
horrible
beer
there
are
better
choices

and
easy

side

not

picked
up
a
bottle
at
abes
cold
beer
poured
a
brilliant
gold
with
a
short
head
a
sudzy

the
aroma
is
a
touch
catty
as
it
warms
but
otherwise
theres
an
enticing
fruity
floral
mix
under
big
woodsy
spice
the
flavor
has
a
crisp
and
toasty
malt
background
under
big
kick
of
those
spicy
hops
and
before
a
big
but
not
a
huge
biting
bitterness
it
reminds
me
of
a
more
reasonable
version
of
the
old
sam
adams
imperial
pils
check
it
out
if
youre
a
fan
of
the
style
and
big
euro
hops
there
are
a
few
breckenridge
brews
that
have
gotten
my
attention
over
the
years
lucky
u
ipa
and
471
esb
a
scottish
ale
come
to
mind
sorry
to
say
regal
pilsner
doesnt
have
what
it
takes
to
be
considered
among
this
brewerys
best
on
a
positive
note
it
has
more
character
than
much
of
what
they
brew
the
beer
is
light
to
medium
with
a
oily
sticky
texture
carbonation
is
average
and
the
finish
is
abrupt
with
lingering
bitterness
what
can
i
say
about
a
beer
where
the
taste
is
the
worst
part
of
the
experience
rather
than
ponder
or
get
verbose
ill
just
say
this
i
wont
be
drinking
this
again
anytime
soon
if
you
want
to
appreciate
this
style
in
all
its
glory
seek
out
the
boulevard
orval
collaboration
or
the
sam
adams
hallertau
imperial
pilsner
overall
just
no
this
just
isnt
good
too
bready
and
too
malty
this
one
just
doesnt
work
and
i
dont
want
a
lot
of
it
the
beer
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
some
grassy
hops
along
with
a
lot
of
bready
malt
not
nearly
as
hoppy
smelling
as
a
lot
of
the
imperial
pilseners
that
i
have
tried
the
flavor
is
more
of
the
same
with
a
lot
of
malt
and
a
little
bit
of
grassy
and
spicy
hop
character
the
alcohol
is
present
but
not
too
strong
medium
body
and
medium
carbonation
d
this
beer
i
had
to
choke
down
the
higher
abv
limits
this
beer
to
a
couple
of
glasses
this
beer
i
didnt
like
at
all
although
this
seems
to
be
a
problem
i
have
with
this
brewery
very
drinkable
a
lot
lighter
than
i
was
expecting
but
i
could
see
myself
drinking
more
than
one
d
the
flavor
of
this
was
nice
but
the
nose
was
just
not
enjoyable
not
sure
what
happened
there
but
such
is
life
taste
much
like
the
smell
floral
hops
moderate
bitterness
smooth
mouthfeel
with
some
hints
of
the
alcohol
in
the
finish
one
of
the
best
double
pilsners
ive
had
not
completely
over
the
top
this
one
remains
well
balanced
with
the
spirit
of
a
pilsner
intact
id
think
of
it
as
a
lager
for
ipa
lovers
its
too
bad
this
is
an
occasional
and
the
price
point
is
so
high
because
id
drink
this
all
the
time
i
love
hops
and
really
great
hoppy
pilsners
and
this
is
exactly
what
i
want
in
a
beer
soft
sweet
malts
up
front
honeyish
with
a
nice
biscuit
backing
herbal
peppery
hops
come
in
midpalate
bitterness
gradually
increases
toward
the
finish
notes
of
candyish
fruit
and
powdered
sugar
dryish
finish
with
lingering

overall
the

a

reminds

a

a

dangerously

breckenridge
i
wasnt
sure
about
this
at
first
but
it
grew
on
me
as
i
made
my
way
through
the
bottle
smell
is
fairly
mild
a
hint
of
bready
malt
with
subtle
hop
aroma
this
seemed
watery
and
a
bit
sweet
on
the
first
sip
but
a
definite
hop
backbone
comes
through
in
the
aftertaste
wellbalanced
fullbodied
but
not
heavy
and
pleasantly
strong
i
got
this
as
a
single
but
would
be
happy
to
have
another
one
clear
copper
with
a
sudsy
cream
colored
head
that
leaves
sheets
of
sticky
lace
on
the
glass
fruity
american
hop
notes
and
untoasted
grain
with
a
slightly
floral
perfumey
quality
in
the
aroma
clean
and
dry
flavors
with
plenty
of
fresh
spicy
hop
bittering
and
a
slightly
warm
alcoholic
finish
full
bodied
with
nice
heft
and
smooth
carbonation
this
is
a
strange
brew
for
sure
clean
and
grainy
with
a
boozy
kick
and
plenty
of
hop
flavor
kind
of
like
a
small
batch
hoppy
malt
liquor
i
dig
it
d
i
found
this
to
be
one
of
the
more
drinkable
imperial
pilsners
ive
come
across
in
my
travels
this
one
swaps
flavor
for
warm
alcohol
notes
making
it
one
of
my
favorite
examples
of
the
styles
ive
sampled
thus
far
pours
golden
with
grassy
and
lemony
citrus
hops
the
flavor
is
similar
hoppy
peppery
grass
up
front
with
the
pale
malt
showing
more
in
the
finish
easing
up
on
the
dryness
level
a
bit
but
its
still
fairly
dry
its
stronger
but
still
maintains
the
flavor
and
hop
character
of
a
good
traditional
pils
not
bad
with
all
that
said
its
not
a
bad
beer
drinkable
but
with
the
choices
given
certainly
not
one
to
select
again
on
tap
at
the
rackhouse
pub
i
think
it
was
just
listed
as
breckenridge
imperial
pilsner
but
whatever
i
t
was
yellow
and
smelled
like
a
pilsner
with
an
unfortunate
hint
of
wet
dog
at
first
as
it
warmed
up
it
was
gone
so
i
cant
complain
too
much
about
the
dog
qualities
it
had
a
fruity
taste
but
also
dirty
and
thick
not
my
cup
of
tea
as
far
as
a
pilsner
goes
odell
i
think
had
this
style
nailed
with
their
double
pilsner
but
i
would
not
get
this
again
d
this
was
a
nice
offering
but
a
bit
too
boozy
for
my
tastes
on
a
warm
june
evening
the
lightness
makes
it
go
down
quick
for
a
beer
this
strong
had
this
one
on
tap
at
the
rackhouse
pub
in
denver
dont
really
know
much
about
it
but
it
was
billed
as
an
imperial
pilsner
maybe
a
little
dark
for
the
style
a
dark
goldamber
color
with
a
little
bit
of
white
foam
some
sweet
maltcaramel
aroma
almost
like
a
strong
adjunct
lager
not
much
flavor
wise
similar
to
the
smell
a
decent
beer
but
i
wont
be
ordering
another
one
notes
great
head
on
this
very
clean
quite
nice
it
really
doesnt
take
much
sipping
before
this
seems
like
any
other
ipa
from
the
22
oz
bottle
purchased
at
best
damn
beer
shop
in
san
diego
o
decent
take
on
the
style
will
not
purchase
again
at
7
99
a
bomber
pours
a
clear
orange
with
a
foamy
orangetan
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
citrus
fruit
and
citrus
zest
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
honey
and
citrus
zest
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
an
above
average
beer
that
smells
pretty
good
but
the
hop
flavors
are
fairly
subdued
o
the
beer
looked
great
but
i
think
it
could
have
used
a
little
more
hop
punch
i
probably
wouldnt
buy
this
again
unless
i
see
it
on
tap
again
good
body
surely
on
the
sweet
side
o
although
they
only
do
one
thing
they
do
it
so
damn
well
probably
the
best
pilsner
ive
ever
had
if
this
were
to
come
out
in
cans
for
the
summer
id
buy
it
by
the
12pack
so
deliciously
crushable
resiny
aroma
floral
pine
good
citrus
flavor
with
resin
and
lightly
bitter
finish
a
bit
too
bitter
for
me
enjoying
a
pint
of
this
at
1702
very
smooth
and
clean
would
order
it
again
bright
brass
with
a
white
head
that
leaves
some
nice
strings
of
lace
hoppy
aroma
though
not
super
aromatic
grassy
citrusy
hops
green
grapes
and
a
herbal
spicy
edge
fresh
clean
hoppy
flavor
crisp
and
green
sort
of
like
a
handful
of
hop
pellets
a
light
malt
sweetness
runs
through
the
middle
but
it
finishes
hoppy
like
it
starts
only
in
more
of
a
traditional
peppery
spicy
way
surprisingly
light
bodied
for
its
strength
maintaining
the
crispness
that
i
want
from
anything
including
the
word
pilsner
in
its
title
good
tingly
carbonation
and
a
restrained
bitterness
make
for
pleasantly
easy
drinking
nice
serving
type
on
tap
a
great
beer
from
these
guys
they
did
real
well
on
this
one
o
an
excellent
unique
beer
perfect
as
a
summer
alternative
when
you
want
a
sipper
but
dont
want
anything
too
heavy
the
beer
pours
a
white
bubbly
and
frothy
head
that
takes
a
while
to
dissipate
and
leaves
quite
a
bit
of
very
nice
lacing
on
the
walls
of
the
glass
the
beer
itself
is
a
clear
brown
with
orange
notes
the
beer
is
also
a
little
bit
hazy
but
thats
most
likely
due
to
the
temperature
difference
between
the
beer
and
the
glass
the
smell
has
strong
honey
and
graham
cracker
notes
mixed
with
a
bit
of
light
oatmeal
the
hops
are
a
little
bit
buried
beneath
the
other
notes
but
provide
a
nice
base
with
its
bitter
and
grassy
notes
the
taste
is
a
bit
stronger
with
the
hop
notes
and
the
oatmeal
as
well
as
the
sweeter
honey
and
oat
notes
are
weaker
however
the
mix
is
much
better
than
in
the
smell
because
its
no
longer
so
sweet
additionally
there
is
a
slight
alcohol
taste
that
is
very
faint
and
barely
noticeable
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
but
on
the
thicker
side
and
very
light
on
the
carbonation
despite
the
good
head
retention
overall
a
very
good
beer
that
is
worth
getting
if
you
havent
done
so
despite
the
odd
pairing
the
combination
actually
works
very
well
in
how
one
note
offsets
the
other
and
prevents
it
from
becoming
too
overwhelming
owasnt
bad
but
it
failed
to
stand
out
against
all
the
other
beers
i
tried
during
my
stay
at
acbf
o
basically
a
super
pilsner
very
strong
pilsner
malt
and
grassy
hops
plus
the
grainy
oatmeal
for
complexity
decent
bitterness
for
a
pilsner
too
but
of
course
this
not
an
ipa
or
something
bright
and
sharp
tasty
but
i
think
im
more
of
a
fan
of
the
lighter
more
sessionable
pilsners
a
massive
lager
being
an
oatmeal
pilsner
really
rounds
this
brew
out
while
the
malt
backbone
puts
on
quite
a
show
we
had
selfishly
hoped
that
the
hops
would
have
been
dialed
up
a
tad
more
which
would
have
pushed
this
beer
into
a
beer
for
the
gods
we
guess
our
palates
can
live
with
just
great
pours
a
bright
golden
color
with
a
tight
white
head
non
stop
cascade
of
tiny
bubbles
rise
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
smells
sweet
slightly
caramel
and
dough
like
malty
sweet
taste
very
crisp
and
then
a
lingering
warm
alcohol
finish
very
enjoyable
on
a
dreary
summer
eve
the
mouthfeel
is
what
you
would
expect
from
an
imperial
pilsner
style
and
the
crisp
smooth
mouthfeel
makes
the
taste
a
bit
more
enjoyable
there
is
a
light
and
airy
mouthfeel
within
the
spf
and
the
beer
works
its
way
across
the
mouth
quite
easily
serving
type
ontap
blind
pig
overall
a
very
successful
beer
to
bad
it
is
not
sold
in
texas
overall
this
is
an
interesting
beer
and
quite
tasty
hope
they
make
it
again
next
summer
but
i
also
hope
they
try
something
else
because
i
dont
think
this
brewery
does
anything
wrong
it
would
be
exciting
to
see
what
else
they
do
this
is
a
well
balanced
beer
with
a
great
mouthfeel
easy
to
drink
for
nearly
9
abv
taste
is
odd
dont
really
know
whats
going
on
here
its
pilslike
but
at
the
same
time
creamy
oatmeal
and
darkish
finish
is
metallic
like
licking
a
penny
not
a
fan
mouthfeel
is
decent
but
doesnt
seem
to
fit
one
of
the
more
confusing
beers
ive
had
in
my
day
o
so
different
i
think
i
have
to
like
it
right
original
concept
for
sure
i
commend
the
effort
but
not
sure
i
would
drink
this
again
alcohol
is
a
bit
too
forward
and
everything
else
leaves
me
wanting
very
glad
i
got
to
try
thats
for
damn
sure
overall
this
was
a
really
interesting
beer
the
thickness
was
somewhat
expected
but
still
foreign
even
in
an
imperial
pilsner
worth
a
shot
taste
begins
sweet
and
earthy
spicy
and
citrus
in
the
middle
with
a
lightly
crisp
close
mouthfeel
is
soft
over
the
tongue
and
smooth
and
drinkability
is
very
nice
not
as
sazzheavy
as
i
would
expect
from
a
double
pils
but
just
an
enjoyable
brew
wow
there
is
a
lot
going
on
in
this
beer
perhaps
one
of
the
most
complex
and
interesting
beers
ive
had
in
a
long
time
unique
and
delicious
i
cant
wait
to
try
the
other
4
elements
that
i
picked
up
thanks
to
darthkostrizer
for
bringing
these
guys
to
my
attention
o
all
in
all
this
is
a
very
solid
beer
this
is
a
beer
that
will
quench
your
thirst
like
a
pilsner
but
give
you
a
buzz
like
a
barley
wine
without
any
bit
of
cloying
definitely
try
if
you
a
like
a
good
light
beer
that
still
has
a
good
kick
for
you
good
job
to
element
o
this
is
probably
the
only
limited
release
element
has
done
that
i
felt
was
actually
worth
the
money
i
spent
on
the
bottle
while
it
is
still
very
steep
17
99
atleast
its
a
really
good
offering
i
like
the
outside
of
the
box
combination
here
the
oats
really
works
well
with
the
pilsner
qualities
while
i
wouldnt
buy
it
again
due
to
the
cost
i
can
actually
say
im
glad
i
spent
the
money
on
this
something
about
evil
twins
strong
hoppy
beer
that
is
punishingly
sweet
i
hated
the
single
hop
molotov
and
while
this
isnt
quite
so
diabetic
its
majorly
sweet
especially
for
a
wheat
lager
not
sure
why
but
it
is
it
really
takes
away
from
the
mosaic
hops
which
smell
a
whole
lot
more
alive
and
awesome
than
they
taste
goes
great
with
the
wheat
malt
which
is
robust
in
both
flavor
and
texture
grainy
but
sort
with
ice
bubbles
if
this
were
drier
it
would
feel
amazing
nice
combination
of
flavors
and
well
balanced
but
so
sweet
as
to
be
distracting
and
not
just
in
the
finish
but
all
the
way
through
hard
to
tell
its
a
lager
not
much
yeast
flavor
here
and
no
crispness
because
of
the
sugar
i
had
it
on
tap
but
have
heard
bottles
are
much
better
for
some
reason
still
love
evil
twin
but
this
had
way
more
potential
add
brett
and
give
it
a
year
i
bet
it
would
be

the

of
cinnamon

were
a
great
start
but
disappointing
at
the
end
and
kind
of
sharp
on
your
tongue
personally
i
would
have
liked
a
little
less
hops
and
a
little
lighter
beer
i
think
fans
of
west
coast
ipas
should
give
this
a
try
at
least
the
hophead
i
was
with
really
enjoyed
it
mmmm
this
is
delicious
it
tastes
like
captains
daughter
wants
to
be
with
a
beautifully
complex
mosaic
nose
and
flavor
with
a
thick

and
lowtomedium

id
definitely
buy
bomber
again
better
than
i
expected

just

lacing
the
aroma
is
citrus
and
floral
hops
tangerine
honey
lemon
flowers
and
some
spicy
wheat
notes
the
taste
is
honey
and
floral
hops
followed
by
some
tangerine
and
orange
peel
hints
of
lermon
and
lime
nice
amount
of
wheat
flavor
with
some
tropical
notes
towards
the
end
bready
finishes
with
tangerines
wheat
and
honey
super
carbonated
cant
be
in
a
hurry
to
drink
this
one
mosaic
is
what
caught
my
eye
for
this
one
overall
pretty
interesting
beer
id
buy
again
o
a
great
idea
for
a
beer
although
i
wouldnt
be
able
to
tell
you
it
was
a
lager
if
i
didnt
already
know
it
is
trailing
dry
with
those
piney
sprucy
and
spicy
wood
bitterness
the
beer
shows
its
ipa
roots
extremely
well
but
in
the
imperial
vein
a
slight
semblance
of
sweetness
and
dextrin
body
remains
and
give
the
hops
a
proper
balance
in
the
end
my
first
gander
into
imperial
pilsners
at
11
this
beer
should
be
boozy
but
its
not
the
mouthfeel
is
where
this
beer
excels
and
it
where
it
wanes
is
its
lack
of
hop
character
definitely
a
nice
sipper
a
little
sweet
for
my
current
palate
but
the
lingering
honey
orange
and
cream
soda
notes
are
well
executed
ive
never
tried
the
original
obp
so
i
cant
compare
it
ironically
if
this
were
called
a
wheatwine
it
would
be
rated
probably
alot
higher
and
no
one
would
bat
an
eye
interesting
aroma
hints
of
chemical
and
natural
complexity
i
really
cant
tell
which
the
flavor
is
golden
when
it
comes
to
malt
with
nothing
else
to
balance
and
the
honey
just
about
crowns
it
i
just
cant
get
past
the
fact
that
this
is
a
pilsner
and
it
180s
nearly
everything
i
has
hopes
for
when
i
cracked
it
overall
its
not
bold
for
an
11
brew
and
id
certainly
recommend
having
this
as
the
first
beer
of
the
night
as
the
light
toastyhoneynougat
flavor
would
be
easy
to
lose
and
otherwise
its
fairly
plain
id
have
a
second
if
id
bought
more
than
the
one
bottle
and
stop
there
this
could
be
dangerous
im
not
sure
how
the
brewers
pulled
this
one
off
but
bravo
this
could
have
easily
been
a
sticky
sweet
boozy
mess
and
it
comes
off
as
a
pleasant
wellbalanced
sipper
even
without
any
other
doublehoney
10
lagers
to
compare
this
to
i
feel
pretty
strongly
that
this
one
would
be
significantly
better
than
average
o
i
received
this
beer
as
an
extra
in
a
trade
and
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
from
this
pilsner
it
is
brewed
with
honey
so
i
knew
it
would
be
sweet
the
smell
was
nauseating
but
the
flavor
was
acceptable
good
fruit
flavors
and
no
sign
of
the
11
alcohol
i
am
glad
it
wasnt
a
bomber
because
i
was
growing
tired
of
it
by
the
end
of
the
12
oz
pour
to
be
fair
it
wasnt
the
worst
beer
i
have
tried
and
i
always
appreciate
unique
and
experimental
brews
i
dont
endorse
this
beer
fully
but
if
you
tend
to
like
beers
with
some
wine
or
cider
characteristics
give
it
a
try
this
is
a
pretty
interesting
and
exciting
experiment
i
kinda
like
it
and
kinda
dont
its
really
hard
to
explain
i
think
12
ounces
is
just
too
much
at
least
for
me
the
proper
serving
would
be
3
or
4
ounces
after
dinner
i
really
think
it
should
be
tried
though
it
is
a
very
creative
and
different
beer
overall
my
wife
liked
it
much
more
than
i
so
was
happy
to
share
its
good
just
a
bit
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
overall
tasty
and
pleasant
but
again
nothing
grand
o
dumped
down
the
drain
after
taking
two
sips
interesting
for
sure
good
if
you
want
a
quick
buzz
at
11
but
i
couldnt
drink
it
orange
blossom
pilsner
squared
isnt
very
good
its
okay
at
best
frankly
the
orange
and
honey
flavors
just
dont
work
well
with
the
pilsner
malt
base
its
also
too
big
and
too
boozy
11
abv
is
far
too
much
for
this
one
as
a
novelty
i
guess
its
interesting
and
perhaps
worth
a
try
stick
with
a
single
bottle
if
you
can
not
a
bad
beer
definitely
cant
tell
it
is
11
alcohol
by
the
taste
i
could
see
this
working
as
a
pairing
with
food
a
sipper
and
fairly
pleasant
sweet
and
good
for
dessert
im
curious
as
to
the
point
of
this
beer
the
viscosity
and
alcohol
completely
ruin
any
chance
of
pilsner
crispness
and
refreshing
qualities
not
everything
works
if
you
imperialize
it
and
this
is
a
shining
example
why
is
this
a
herbedspiced
brew
american
strong
ale
all
the
way
it
tastes
like
a
superpowered
cream
ale
the
beer
is
amberorange
and
has
a
very
small
wisp
of
white
suds
atop
the
nose
is
slightly
sweet
with
a
good
amount
of
grainy
and
spicy
notes
the
flavor
is
fairly
boozy
though
it
is
not
unexpected
given
the
abv
and
is
lightly
toasty
and
caramelized
it
is
not
great
but
it
is
not
bad
at
all
it
is
worth
noting
that
the
orange
blossom
honey
is
not
noted
the
only
aroma
suggesting
this
is
a
beer
is
a
hint
of
graininess
otherwise
it
smells
remarkably
like
a
creamsickle
thickish
syrupy
and
excruciatingly
sweet
some
citric
hops
and
husky
grain
flounder
in
a
sea
of
marshmellow
fluff
and
orange
hard
candy
i
realize
the
honey
the
feature
ingredient
here
but
this
is
overkill
at
home
it
would
have
been
a
drainpour
at
the
bar
i
left
23
of
it
untouched
strong
recommendation
to
avoid
unless
youre
a
fan
of
underattenuated
messes
like
creme
brulee
and
dark
lord
in
that
case
this
may
be
a
treat
for
you
overall
wow
my
first
real
drainpour
ever
seriously
ive
powered
through
some
pretty
bad
homebrews
in
my
day
but
my
god
this
is
the
worst
beer
i
have
had
in
a
long
time
the
flavors
were
cheap
and
medicinal
the
alcohol
was
certainly
not
well
hidden
and
it
was
overall
just
a
painful
experience
i
want
to
wash
it
off
my
tongue
with
bmc
overall
a
really
clean
and
crisp
beer
with
some
potent
flavor
that
really
impresses
the
palate
while
remaining
relatively
calm
im
pretty
impressed
overall
a
good
rich
flavor
that
seems
to
work
even
at
colder
temperatures
id
recommend
having
one
or
two
d
this
goes
down
too
easily
and
is
most
similar
to
a
mildflavored
and
weaker
bodied
wheatwine
had
this
served
from
a
bottle
at
fifty
brews
in
orlando
must
say
i
prefer
the
original
much
more
this
beer
smells
amazing
but
its
taste
is
over
the
top
it
feels
syrupy
in
the
mouth
and
is
beyond
sweet
it
almost
tastes
like
a
mead
not
a
beer
overall
this
would
not
be
a
choice
as
despite
the
high
alcohol
content
the
level
of
sweetness
is
just
too
much
this
pilsner
pours
a
deep
golden
hue
with
a
tinge
of
red
no
head
no
lacing
the
smell
is
slightly
sweet
but
mostly
of
booze
this
beer
has
a
strong
flavor
mostly
honey
and
alcohol
there
is
a
slight
taste
of
orange
sadly
this
beer
has
potential
but
doesnt
deliver
it
just
gets
you
drunk
and
quick
great
to
taste
but
you
can
only
really
have
one
i
made
the
mistake
drank
the
four
pak
and
had
a
major
hangover
try
it
pretty
interesting
wildcard
of
a
beer
it
describes
itself
as
a
pilsner
but
there
isnt
really
any
pilsner
to
it
its
more
similar
to
an
imperial
pale
ale
sans
hops
great
beer
too
strong
to
drink
a
lot
of
but
totally
worth
trying
decent
but
not
sure
if
i
can
produce
enough
insulin
to
have
another
anytime
soon
mobile
review
a
solid
beer
ive
never
had
anything
quite
like
it
and
ive
had
a
lot
of
different
beers
definitely
worth
trying
i
think
they
achieved
what
they
were
going
for
here
im
just
not
sure
how
much
i
like
it
the
orange
blossom
honey
comes
across
in
a
really
clean
way
not
a
whole
lot
going
on
besides
that
the
alcohol
is
hidden
in
a
creepy
way
because
its
so
light
tasting
the
body
is
a
little
syrupy
and
the
carbonation
low
which
gives
away
the
alcohol
more
than
the
taste
its
what
i
would
call
a
bang
for
your
buck
beer
not
great
but
if
you
dont
really
like
the
taste
of
craft
beer
and
you
want
a
cheap
buzz
look
no
further
d
at
first
the
alcohol
is
hidden
but
a
little
farther
into
the
beer
will
relieve
how
little
drinkability
this
has
drinkability
decent
enough
for
a
dose
for
me
the
boost
of
carbonation
saves
this
one
keeping
what
could
be
an
overly
sweet
cloying
beverage
about
as
drinkable
as
a
simple
11
abv
honeybasted
brew
can
be
not
sure
where
they
were
trying
to
go
with
this
one
but
it
did
not
work
well
for
me
a
very
good
beer
and
while
its
not
reinventing
the
wheel
with
its
flavor
pallet
its
definitely
one
to
still
be
reckoned
with
on
a
side
note
i
really
enjoy
the
label
art
of
the
jacked
and
tan
honey
bee
clear
golden
amber
hue
not
much
head
to
speak
of
honey
dominates
the
smell
theres
also
a
very
faint
orange
but
really
thats
about
the
only
scents
that
can
be
detected
you
have
to
really
sift
through
the
honey
to
get
to
the
other
flavors
sweet
orange
with
hints
of
clove
and
caramel
malts
you
do
get
a
sense
of
the
alcohol
towards
the
finish
but
honey
is
what
you
are
ultimately
left
with
has
a
sticky
somewhat
syrupy
feel
i
didnt
care
for
this
after
the
first
couple
drinks
but
it
did
grow
on
me
a
little
too
sweet
to
drink
very
often
but
it
was
a
nice
change
of
pace
tcb
orange
blossom
pilsner
squared
has
a
few
more
positives
than
negatives
as
beer
thomas
creek
brewery
should
blow
the
doors
off
the
joint
and
give
serious
consideration
to
obp

the
fifth

just
might
be
some
seriously
bitchin
orangehoney
liqueur
as
to
drinkability
i
enjoyed
it
quite
well
one
serving
however
was
my
limit
its
fairly
unique
though
and
interesting
so
i
guess
the
question
is
would
i
buy
more
of
these
yes
i
think
so
its
charming
in
a
way
a
bit
of
a
sipper
but
pretty
rich
and
entertaining
bottle

of
dchmela
deep
orange
pour
with
a
frothy
bleached
white
head
the
nose
is
of
orange

and
malts
candy
sugars
and
honey
tastes
of
sweet
orange
peel
and
syrupy
sweet
malts
straw
and
lots
of
honey
this
one
is
all
about
the
sweet
orange
flavours
i
preferred
this
when
it
was
really
cold
as
it
becomes
almost
syrupy
as
it
warms
good
in
small
doses
thanks
for
the
bottle
dave
d
thanks
to
tpd975
for
this
via
my
nobody
wants
to
see
a
beer
geek
naked
bif
this
is
pretty
sweet
so
even
a
12oz
bottle
is
suitable
for
splitting
ive
never
had
anything
quite
like
this
though
it
does
remind
me
a
bit
of
troegs
scratch
10
the
anise
triple
unique
and
worth
trying
if
youre
down
with
obp
now
that
i
think
about
it
maybe
i
should
not
be
surprised
that
this
florida
lager
resembled
a
belgian
ale
so
much
the
yeast
a
defining
quality
of
many
belgian
beers
would
be
totally
different
but
one
key
similarity
they
share
the
addition
of
a
nonmalt
sugar
source
for
the
yeast
to
feed
on
many
belgian
beers
add
brewers
sugars
this
lager
used
fresh
honey
so
i
can
see
how
the
resulting
taste
after
fermentation
might
be
similar
tasted
just
like
honey
almost
too
sweet
bordered
on
cloying
but
it
pulled
it
off
some
orange
in
the
back
ground
way
better
beer
than
i
was
expecting
it
to
be

a

thisa
good

and
a
fun
try
but
a

too
sweet
for
meor
to
be
very
sessionable
overall
drinkability
is
rather
poor
due
to
the
taste
im
glad
i
only
purchased
one
single
twelve
ounce
bottle
this
will
probably
be
a
drainpour
joining
the
ranks
of
bells
cherry
stout
all
in
all
started
off
too
intense
and
quickly
mellowed
into
an
excellent
brew
the

silkysmooth
and
on
the
full
side
of

the
brew
is
lightlycarbonated
and
one
bottle
is
more
than
plenty
for
me
the
taste
is
surprisingly
good
at
first
with
juicy
notes
of
melon
flesh
sweet
clover
honey
caramel
and
a
kiss
of
german
hops
however
the
sweetness
lingers
along
the
back
of
the
palate
for
too
long
and
takes
on
somewhat
of
an
artificial
saccharin
note
alcohol
is
very
wellhidden
great
mouthfeel
too
with
a
crisp
bubbly
medium
body
that
borders
on
thick
but
never
becomes
too
syrupy
or
viscous
all
in
all
a
pleasant
surprise
from
a
quite
honestly
mediocre
brewery
id
recommend
this
beer
and
probably
have
it
again
although
i
cant
really
see
myself
wanting
another
anytime
soon
its
probably
not
possible
two
drink
more
than
two
of
these
either
the
sweetness
will
do
you
in
or
the
booze
will
at

this
is
definitely
a
sipper

the
taste

an
interestingly
strong
blend
of

and
orange
spice
with
a
kick
of
puckering
bitter
hops
the
sad
thing
however
is
they
dont
seem
to
get
along
that
well
especially
swimming
in
all
that
alcohol
the
beer
is
certainly
heavy
with
a
strong
alcohol
kick
this
is
one
beer
that
was
much
better
on
draft
d
for
the
alcohol
this
is
pretty
light
the
sweetness
is
the
only
thing
holding
this
back

im
impressed

amazing

a

slight
off

crackles
and
dissipates
to
a
thin
layer
in
minutes
at

this
is
not
suprising
sweet
and
malty
in
the
nose
with
hints
of

the
flavor
is
sweet
with
a
flash

is

theres
a

with
a
decent

all
in

this
seems
to
be
a
bit
simplicitic
it
is
tasty
but
there
is
nothing
making
me
say
wow
for
11
i
want
more
flavor
too
sweet
to
drink
much
but
tasty
on
its
own
other
comments
pretty
solid
brew
though
it
does
get
a
bit
cloying
after
about
half
a
glass
and
that
was
even
when
sharing
a
12
oz
bottle
with
someone
else
this
is
not
a
commonly
seen
brew
around
here
in
charlotte
nc
i
lucked
out
at
the
always
impressive
common
market
and
had
this
sweet
thing
this
is
miles
away
from
the
original
orange
blossom
pilsner
it
is
darker
hew
in
color
and
has
a
nice
orange
tinted
white
head
it
has
a
nice
citris
crisp
smell
with
hints
of
honey
and
sweet
malts
this
beer
taste
very
sweet
with
honey
and
malt
as
oppossed
to
the
original
which
is
leaning
more
in
the
fruit
orange
direction
there
is
some
orange
fruit
in
the
flavor
but
the
honey
really
dominates
this
beer
really
reminds
myself
and
others
who
had
it
with
me
of
a
mead
it
is
strong
in
alcohol
but
the
flavor
really
makes
this
heafty
beer
an
easy
drinker
i
would
highly
recommend
it
to
anyone
especially
those
who
want
to
try
high
alcohol
beers
but
are
hesitant
because
of
the
overbearing
tastes
usually
associated
with
them
12
oz

with
2
cm
foamy
off

that
thins
out
pretty
quickly
aroma
of
honey
and
alcohol
initial
flavor
of
sugarhoney
flavor
balances
out
slightly
by
the
end
thankfully
aftertaste
is
still
kinda
sugary
but
short
lived
medium
body
moderate
lacing
light
carbonation
and
obvious
alcohol
overall
worth
a
try
and
as
long
as
its
even
a
little
chilled
you
can
get
just
about
anyone
to
try
it
overall
i
must
say
i
am
pleasantly
surprised
i
dont
care
for
the
the
regular
obp
at
all
but
i
was
at
total
wine
and
liquor
and
saw
this
sitting
in
a
special
section
of
beers
while
not
brewed
here
i
still
like
to
think
of
it
as
a
hometown
brewery
and
im
always
down
with
trying
to
support
our
local
breweries
i
applaud
our
boy
for
making
an
extreme
beer
and
i
will
be
picking
up
another
four
pack
in
the
future
overall
one
of
my
favorites
from
this
brewery
i
have
bought
several
six
packs
so
its
a
nice
one
to
have
around
all
the
time
overall
this
isnt
a
bad
tasting
beer
i
had
their
other
obp
and
this
one
is
a
better
beer
by
far
the
overpowering
honey
taste
is
just
too
much
for
me
d
not
bad
they
need
to
hide
the
alcohol
a
bit
more
for
this
one
to
live
up
to
its
full
ability
body
is
big
sticky
and
smooth
the
sweetness
and
strong
boozey
alcohol
limits
drinkability
but
it
does
taste
good
definately
something
to
share
and
sip
on
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
golden
orange
color
with
an
offwhite
head
that
possesses
pretty
decent
lacing
qualities
the
aroma
is
very
sweet
with
a
lot
of
honey
and
just
a
touch
of
malt
and
alcohol
with
not
much
in
the
way
of
hops
to
note
the
taste
is
very
sweet
and
cloying
with
a
lot
of
honey
flavors
overall
there
is
just
too
much
sweet
honey
flavors
but
i
guess
that
was
the
point
of
this
beer
just
not
really
my
thing
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
taste
overall
obp
2
is
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
something
i
would
purchase
again
obp
2
pours
a
hazy
orange
with
a
white
head
from
a
brown
twelve
ounce
bottle
there
is
a
strong
sweet
honey
aroma
it
does
smell
like
a
much
more
intense
version
of
the
original
sweet
and
very
honey
like
a
much
improved
execution
over
the
original
which
seemed
very
light
almost
macro
like
this
has
body
and
full
flavor
but
if
you
dont
like
sweet
this
might
not
be
your
beer
pretty
good
poured
into
a
pint

dark
straw
yellow
almost
orange

not
much

and
even
less
lacing
strong
honey
smell
and
flavor
smooth
mouthfeel
better
than
the
original
obp
as
far
as
a
pilsner
go
this
isnt
to
me
its
more
of
a
braggot
as
far
as
a
braggot
its
good
the
original
obp
is
more
of
a
stepup
beer
for
those
who
want
something
better
than
a
light
macro
but
this
beer
seems
to
appeal
to
the
beer
geek
though
i
dont
know
too
many
beer
geeks
that
seek
an
imperial
pilsner
all
in
all
im
glad
i
tried
the
beer
and
since
braggots
and
meads
are
difficult
to
find
in
central
fl
ill
probably
buy
some
more
when
im
in
the
mood
for
that
style

that
eventually
leads

honey
aroma
with
some
citrus

some
biscuity
and
yeasty
aromas
as
well
strong
honey
flavor
off
the
bat
that
leads
into
some
citrus
flavors
i
almost
tastes
like
a
watered
down
mead
smooth
mouthfeel
teases
the
palate
and
has
a
high
carbonation
level
at
first
but
mellows
out
over
time
definitely
better
than
other
lighter
version
but
it
just
seems
to
be
the
same
beer
with
less
water
and
more
honey
at
11
percent
this
just
makes
me
ask
why
hoppy
but
not
overly
so
has
a
malty
sweetness
that
balances
well
with

hops

i
have
never
heard
of
this
brewery
before
but
i
need
to
check
them
out
a
little
more
because
this
brew
is
something
else
an
ipa
with
a
light
feel
freaking
sweet
o
my
first
experience
with
this
style
and
it
was
better
than
expected
very
nice
clean
flavors
overall
very
enjoyable
a
notch
above
average
and
that
is
ok
with
me
very
good
beer
although
i
fear
that
this
one
falls
victim
to
the
ipl
syndrome
that
ive
come
to
find
with
many
beers
of
this
style
the
heavy
hoppage
of
ipls
covers
up
the
lager
yeast
flavors
a
bit
too
much
and
youve
gotta
wonder
why
not
an
ipa
i
will
say
though
that
the
lagering
gives
this
beer
a
nice
refreshing
clean
and
crisp
finish
very
good
overall
and
im
glad
that
i
picked
up
a
sixer
to
share
with
friends
o
this
beer
is
listed
as
an
india
pale
lager
i
think
we
need
a
new
category
here
on
ba
it
was
a
nice
variation
of
a
lager
it
is
not
a
flavorful
as
an
ipa
but
this
is
quite
a
good
lager
i
have
had
it
a
couple
times
and
is
a
nice
change
of
pace
interesting
take
on
the
ipa
by
lagering
making
it
an
ipl
a
little
heavy
on
the
cascade
hops
for
my
tastes
i
know
the
tendency
with
american
ipa
is
to
be
all
grapefruit
all
the
time
nice
brew
try
it
o
a
very
intense
beer
jacks
abby
has
renewed
my
interest
in
lagers
nope
this
is
not
good
imo
not
a
fan
of
triples
so
i
should
have
stayed
away
had
heard
good
things
prior
huge
tropical
aroma
and
taste
hint
of
pine
in
the
end
m
fuller
bodied
and
medium
carb
creamy
finish
not
too
sticky
for
a
double
a
little
boozy
tingle
very
drinkable
for
the
style
not
up
to
the
level
of
jacks
abbys
usual
work
full
bodied
beer
with
a
nice
lingering
flavor
with
the
exception
of
sour
it
really
touches
all
of
your
taste
buds
even
with
all
of
the
big
flavors
its
still
reasonably
smooth
with
a
good
carbonation
level
starts
slightly
sweet
moving
to
slightly
saltyearthy
then
goes
to
a
nice
not
quite
gritty
bitter
finish
really
drinkable
as
drinkable
as
any
ipa
youd
have
that
would
be
sub
7
and
this
ipl
is
10
great
beer
all
around
jacks
abby
does
it
again
this
is
a
10pint
drink
slowly
incredible
on
draft
and
still
a
great
bottle
i
am
saving
one
to
see
how
it
ages
happiness
with
just
a
bit
of
sweet
with
a
smooth
crisp
finish
not
hot
at
all
for
10er
o
this
is
pretty
nice
jacks
abby
continually
puts
out
great
hop
intense
beers
that
are
quite
enjoyable
not
much
differentiation
between
this
and
some
other
jas
offerings
but
good
nonetheless
o
zounds
this
is
a
quality
beverage
super
fresh
and
really
enjoyable
cheers
tastes
fantastically
balanced
and
smooth
but
also
a
little
boring
resinous
pine
and
fruit
hop
nodes
reign
throughout
but
theres
no
variation
nothing
huge
thats
great
normally
but
with
a
10
abv
brew
its
a
little
but
of
a
letdown
this
beer
is
spectacular
can
not
believe
how
good
it
is
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
1
finger
head
amazing
smooth
high
citrus
nose
beer
that
finishes
with
an
ipa
bite
its
a
sneaky
10
pour
as
it
doesnt
feel
like
such
a
high
alcohol
brew
definitely
a
beer
that
has
jumped
onto
my
favorite
list
i
couldnt
drink
it
everyday
im
not
even
sure
if
i
should
finish
the
minigrowler
but
wow
alcohol
may
be
too
hidden
its
so
fresh
so
clean
citrus
pine
head
and
lacing
that
set
the
new
standard
for
10
and
above
prometheus
calls
ja
up
for
gift
giving
advice
overall
pretty
nice
still
like
kiwi
rising
and
original
mass
rising
better
but
this
is
quite
enjoyable
huge
hop
character
very
tropical
at
first
but
it
gets
more
piney
the
longer
it
sits
and
warms
anyone
who
likes
jacks
abby
needs
to
try
this
lager
it
is
one
of
if
not
my
favorite
beers
from
them
dank
pineapple
greatness
for
the
abv
it
is
truly
a
well
crafted
brew
i
rarely
find
hop
bombs
10
or
above
to
compete
with
those
approaching
9
this
one
is
just
great
super
clean
still
with
hops
shining
o
really
nice
triple
ipl
huge
hop
flavors
but
bitterness
is
not
off
the
charts
i
like
it
like
this
teethchattering
bitterness
can
detract
from
the
flavors
sometimes
dont
get
me
wrong
its
very
bitter
and
very
dry
but
the
hop
flavors
are
the
priority
here
lagering
has
made
this
one
exceptionally
smooth
for
a
10
triple
ipl
no
ipa
of
this
caliber
even
comes
close
to
the
smoothness
and
drinkability
serving
type
bottle
merry
christmas
bottle
pours
a
hazy
but
extremely
illuminated
orange
color
large
frothy
white
head
that
slowly
dies
down
and
leaves
a
full
gown
of
lacing
big
honest
nose
that
is
right
in
line
with
the
jack
abby
family
the
label
says
im
dealing
with
columbus
chinook
citra
the
citra
is
very
noticeable
as
is
the
grainy
kernel
maltiness
that
is
fairly
dry
i
also
get
their
yeast
strain
pretty
quickly
the
flavor
makes
me
sit
straight
up
in
my
seat
the
hoppiness
is
huge
and
almost
stringent
but
somehow
very
agreeable
and
tropical
tasting
lots
of
melon
mango
peach
and
the
citrus
family
a
very
grainy
cereally
kernally
flavor
dry
yeastiness
i
am
very
impressed
by
this
beers
lack
of
overall
sweetness
somehow
maintains
a
complete
dryness
maybe
its
because
its
a
lager
alcohol
is
not
surprisingly
noticeable
the
bitterness
is
also
heavy
and
astringent
well
carbonated
yet
another
hopirradiated
lager
from
jacks
abby
i
am
very
impressed
by
gravitytosweetness
ratio
they
did
it
again
they
did
it
again
nearly
clear
the
pale
amber
color
is
deceivingly
inviting
to
the
timid
and
shy
but
please
be
warned
that
thou
shall
not
pass
a
breathalyzer
after
consuming
a
5
liter
bottle
jacks
abby
makes
a
number
of
fantastic
hoppy
lagers
and
tripl
is
another
great
one
to
add
to
their
portfolio
although
this
beer
may
not
be
ground
breaking
it
tastes
very
similar
to
an
imperialized
version
of
hoponius
union
it
is
definitely
worth
seeking
out
for
being
a
triple
this
drinks
light
similar
hop
profile
to
kiwi
rising
but
a
bit
more
tropical
o
the
cloudiness
caught
me
by
surprise
didnt
really
get
any
malt
profile
from
either
the
aroma
or
the
flavor
really
good
flavor
you
would
never
guess
that
this
is
10
abv
dangerously
smooth
o
a
very
wellmade
hoppy
highalcohol
beer
not
boozy
in
the
least
but
the
resiny
hops
lend
it
some
gravitas
great
to
split
amongst
friends
around
christmas
on
tap
at
ny
pizza
pours
a
translucent
orange
color
with
an
inch
of
frothy
head
good
amount
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
lots
of
citrus
hops
and
tropical
fruits
orange
tangerine
guava
mango
and
a
hint
of
peach
the
taste
is
a
lot
like
the
aroma
tangerine
and
guava
but
with
some
orange
peel
as
well
a
bit
more
floral
than
the
aroma
indicated
light
alcohol
warmth
but
i
would
never
have
guessed
the
abv
is
10
finishes
with
the
citrus
hop
bitterness
and
some
warming
alcohol
light
mouthfeel
very
drinkable
overall
well
made
beer
i
would
grab
again
will
get
this
one
again
for
sure
this
is
a
top
class
imperial
ipa
okay
ipl
pine
and
resin
dominate
the
hop
profile
with
a
bit
of
floral
many
great
beers
with
tons
of
hops
often
fall
a
little
short
with
a
medicinal
off
flavor
on
the
finish
but
tripl
finishes
super
crisp
theres
a
perfect
amount
of
malt
balance
and
a
body
that
encourages
you
to
keep
drinking
overall
this
is
a
tasty
triple
ipl
really
big
hop
attributes
and
quite
bitter
but
a
smooth
drinker
with
some
nice
flavor
sits
somewhere
in
between
a
session
beer
than
a
slow
sipper
tasty
4
5
just
behind
mass
rising
on
the
best
ipl
list
overall
this
beer
never
fails
bottle
or
draft
and
you
cant
go
wrong
looking
forward
to
more
of
this
in
the
future
this
beer
is
so
delicious
so
good
i
ordered
another
this
is
a
really
excellent
effort
out
of
framingham
a
great
alchemical
operation
that
brings
the
best
of
two
burgeoning
genres
new
zealandhopped
xpas
and
imperial
pilsners
and
holds
those
qualities
in
elegantly
coordinated
concert
nice
smooth
beer
great
tasting
very
hoppy
i
admit
i
will
be
an
outlier
but
this
beer
is
not
jas
best
o
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
good
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
solid
beer
to
drink
for
a
long
time
great
balance
of
being
highly
drinkable
and
citrusy
against
an
8
5
abv
backdrop
refreshing
and
hoppy
and
tasty
strongly
hopped
but
pretty
well
balanced
overall
this
was
a
nicely
refreshing
surprise
we
hadnt
previouisly
known
jacks
abby
had
come
into
the
greater
rochester
market
so
we
were
floored
to
see
a
heavy
hitter
such
as
kiwi
rising
on
tap
at
an
admittedly
smaller
establishment
well
outside
the
citys
downtown
it
stood
out
almost
immediately
on
the
menu
and
we
had
to
order
it
we
felt
the
interplay
between
the
pilsner
lagery
side
of
the
brew
and
the
cloyingly
fruity
hoppiness
made
for
an
interesting
and
wellreceived
tasting
the
ultimate
balance
wasnt
perfect
as
both
aroma
and
taste
tended
towards
the
sweeter
side
but
the
feel
helped
to
keep
it
even
keeled
to
hop
a
lager
and
something
so
traditionally
bitter
and
muted
as
pilsners
can
be
was
really
the
most
exciting
thing
about
it
these
hops
were
just
wildly
juicy
and
forward
what
a
great
chance
introduction
this
was
for
us
we
look
forward
to
many
more
meetings
in
the
hopefully
near
future
tastey
would
like
to
try
again
love
this
beer
had
a
bottle
dated
at
the
end
of
october
2014
in
february
but
it
doesnt
seem
to
have
mattered
much
i
wonder
how
much
more
incredible
this
beer
tastes
fresh
just
awesome
a
citrus
punch
up
front
that
lingers
cant
tell
its
8
5
abv
goes
down
easy
im
a
big
fan
of
it
overall
ive
seen
a
ton
of
this
sitting
around
and
im
pretty
confused
as
to
why
as
it
still
tastes
fresh
as
hell
and
its
just
a
really
good
beer
really
nice
soft
tropical
hop
flavors
and
great
drinkabilility
that
jacks
abby
ipls
have
at
4
or
5
bucks
for
a
pint
bottle
its
a
solid
value
too
all
around
pretty
decent
smell
is
good
but
not
worthy
of
a
higher
rating
overall
i
am
impressed
very
unique
look
smell
and
taste
refreshingly
uncommon

lager
here
no
surprise
coming
from
jacks
abbey
one
of
the
most
consistent
breweries
in
ma
id
recommend
it
to
anyone
very
off
tasting
brew
a
strange
funk
that
was
not
expected
bottle
has
been
stored
properly
and
appeared
fine
mouthfeel
was
quite
thin
and
color
was
quite
unappealing
bitterness
was
mild
for
such
a
high
ibu
just
an
overpowering
off
taste
a
solid
beer
extremely
smooth
and
drinkable
very
crisp
and
clean
on
the
taste
with
a
bit
of
hoppy
grapefruit
goodness
on
the
back
end
good
lagers
are
my
simple
pleasure
and
this
is
a
great
hoppy
lager
with
southern
hemi
hops
which
are
some
of
my
favorite
i
am
drinking
the
bottle
1
5
months
after
bottling
but
i
believe
hoppy
lagers
fall
off
slower
than
certain
ipadipa
culprits
would
i
rather
have
a
fresh
ipa
w
nelson
galaxy
or
other
southern
hemi
hop
yes
is
this
a
good
enjoyable
hoppy
lager
most
definitely
poured
into
glasses
and
shared
pours
a
slightly
hazy
light
yellow
with
pure
white
head
tons
of
dank
and
floral
hop
aroma
awesome
fruit
resin
and
flowers
followed
by
slight
malt
sweetness
all
in
a
very
dry
and
refreshing
brew
id
guess
nearly
all
of
the
105
stated
ibus
are
late
additions
and
dry
hop
as
there
is
little
to
no
bitterness
evident
nice
dry
but
not
thin
mouth
feel
overall
a
really
wonderful
lager
sharp
asprin
bitterness
mixed
with
a
disappointing
vegetaldms
note
the
newworld
hops
try
pop
up
but
somehow
the
effect
with
the
lager
yeast
produces
some
inharmonious
accords
really
quite
surprised
at
the
love
for
this
one
ja
makes
same
fine
brews
but
i
think
theyre
really
in
their
wheelhouse
at
lower
abvs
mass
rising
while
somewhat
more
enjoyable
than
kiwi
suffers
from
similar
problems
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
you
cannot
taste
the
alcohol
which
can
get
you
into
trouble
with
too
many
of
them
the
hops
balance
it
out
and
its
got
an
intensity
to
it
almost
like
an
ipa
and
lager
but
too
balanced
to
detect
a
difference
i
have
two
of
these
and
i
am
happy
i
got
this
on
a
trade
from
a
good
friend
in
ri
if
you
can
get
your
hands
on
this
beer
buy
it
or
trade
for
it
t
surprisingly
sweet
to
start
very
resiny
passionfruit
and
mandarin
presented
on
kaffir
lime
leaf
platform
very
floral
and
fruity
bready
malts
heavier
than
expected
overall
its
like
a
cross
between
a
bock
and
eipa
could
have
used
some
more
alpha
notes
hop
bitterness
is
nearly
nonexistent
and
would
have
provided
the
needed
balance
pine
and
light
wood
tingle
another
slant
would
be
that
the
bitterness
has
mellowed
and
taken
on
some
cask
like
quality
its
unique
delicious
a
musthave
for
anyone
into
hops
from
down
under
i
have
been
waiting
for
this
beer
for
quite
some
time
and
we
were
finally
able
to
get
some
in
the
store
i
was
impressed
with
the
earthiness
and
minerality
in
this
double
ipl
s
hop
profile
it
has
a
wonderful
citrus
bouquet
but
not
a
specifically
lemon
grapefruit
or
lime
taste
for
me
more
of
just
a
general
cirtus
flavor
i
would
guess
this
may
come
from
kohatu
variety
but
who
can
be
sure
not
sure
if
it
lived
up
to
the
hype
of
best
beer
jacks
abby
has
made
but
it
is
definitely
up
there
worth
the
purchase
at
under
5
for
a
bottle
o
this
is
a
great
beer
unlike
many
ipas
that
all
tend
to
run
together
this
one
stands
apart
its
bold
fruity
and
smooth
with
a
nice
little
alcohol
bite
jacks
abby
has
done
it
again
medium
body
and
medium
carbonation
has
a
noticeable
warmth
of
alcohol
overall
a
wonderful
mosaicshowcase
of
hops
according
to
the
brewerys
bartender
it
has
about
56
hops
and
manages
to
capture
an
array
of
fantastic
flavours
that
any
hoplover
should
enjoy
and
seek
out
overall
delicious
unique
beer
very
drinkable
o
very
interesting
the
astringency
of
the
bitterness
is
a
bit
much
for
me
i
waited
until
my
3rd
bottle
to
review

this
is
a

is

interesting

highly

great
beer
im
an

drinker
for
the
most

but
this
is
one
exceptional
lager
one
of
my
new
favorites
i
would
certainly
get
it
again
and
it
is
the
best
lager
ive
ever
had
for
sure
its
better
than
hoponius
union
i
dunno
i
was
expecting
more
not
as
citrusy
as
i
thought
it
would
be
105
ibus
i
am
still
looking
for
them
and
so
are
my
taste
buds
this
beer
rocks
smooth
as
silk
going
down
so
light
in
color
you
would
not
think
you
are
drinking
a
double
anything
o
a
seasonal
favorite
especially
when
enjoyed
fresh
the
piquant
flavor
from
the
hops
is
not
for
everyone
but
the
balance
on
this
beer
is
superb
worth
getting
at
least
one
of
each

i

a
row
this
beer
amazed
me
o
kiwi
rising
is
an
impressive
beer
one
of
the
best
ive
had
this
year
it
combines
drinkability
with
a
big
abv
somehow
if
youre
expecting
lagerlike
feel
that
is
probably
not
realistic
with
the
big
load
of
hop
oils
but
this
beer
is
delicious
aromatic
flavorful
and
a
musttry
tastes
great
hops
start
out
with
more
typical
grapefruit
and
citrus
nodes
but
theres
a
distinct
whitewhite
flavor
that
becomes
more
present
as
the
beer
warms
very
nice
and
combines
excellently
with
the
crisp
grain
profile
o
reminds
me
of
a
intense
version

mfloral
hoppy
wonderful
you
would
never
know
this
is
a
lager
save
for
the
bready
crispness
of
the
finish
but
even
than
is
covered
up
by
an
aggressive
hopping
that
finishes
longer
than
the
yeast
tries
to
let
it
pale
in
color
with
a
little
haze
an
inch
of
white
head
it
smells
well
hoppy
but
this
is
meant
as
far
as
i
know
to
be
a
showcase
of
new
zealand
varietals
i
get
a
lot
of
nice
juicy
hops
but
i
dont
get
the
nelson
or
the
other
tropical
ones
but
its
still
nice
and
bright
without
bitterness
the
taste
is
good
clean
refreshing
hoppy
impressively
flavorful
for
a
lager
as
most
people
know
them
but
its
lacking
distinction
a
little
bit
for
me
its
not
quite
as
unique
or
different
on
the
hop
side
as
i
was
hoping
and
it
expecting
it
to
be
its
tasty
and
fresh
enough
but
i
dont
get
the
new
zealand
spark
of
fruity
flavors
this
could
easily
be
done
with
american
c
varietals
for
how
it
tastes
great
feel
though
well
carbonated
and
light
on
the
palate
refreshing
and
quicker
finishing
because
of
the
lager
yeast
good
beer
not
standout
but
thanks
to
drlovemd87
for
opening
this
one
with
me
it
had
been
high
on
my
list
for
awhile
now
its
a
little
old
for
ipa
standards
nice

into
my
pfriem
tulip
golden

with
thick
sticky

huge

aroma
with
a
hint
of
pine
really
nice
great
fruity

flavor
its
got
a
definite
kiwi
flavor
with
a
sweet
yet
piney
finish
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
piney
hop
flavor
so
maybe
its
good
its
a
few
months
old
great
smooth
and
crisp
mouthfeel
this
is
excellent
slightly

cleaner
ammonia

body
was
light
and
watery
like

but
not
fleshed

enough
with

to
compensate
for
the
overblown
hop
profile
and
the
higher
almost
sodalike
carbonation
wasnt
helping
either
messy
i
guess
is
a
good
way
to
describe
the
beer
between
the
people
fawning
over
this
when
it
was
shared
and
the
high
ratings
it
seems
to
get
im
simply
confused
o
wow
move
over
whales
this
is
a
epic
beer
tons
of
citrus
perfectly
blended
hops
just
outstanding
still
having
trouble
believing
this
is
a
lager
this
is
one
of
the
beers
in
this
style
that
actually
drinks
well
its
not
a
lager
in
that
you
cannot
have
tow
three
or
even
four
it
drinks
a
bit
sweet
and
with
an
alcohol
presence
but
the
fruit
and
the
choice
of
hops
on
this
have
made
it
work
the
pale
malt
is
at
its
best
to
smooth
everything
out
an
leave
the
palate
dry
and
even
a
bit
refreshed
with
plenty
of
carbonation
to
excite
the
tongue
this
is
definitely
a
strong
beer
and
i
can
see
why
so
many
love
it
its
just
very
good
for
me
but
that
is
more
because
of
my
own
taste
preferences
than
any
flaw
whatsoever
in
this
brew
jacks
abby
continues
to
impress
me
o
tasty
and
pretty
drinkable
ipl
with
nice
hoppy
flavor
not
substantively
different
from
a
dipa
solid
stuff
love
the
hops
in
this
very
juicy
i
actually
prefer
a
little
lighter

a

outstanding
stuff

start
out
great
but
then
nothing
the
finish
is
bland
if
i
tasted
this
without
knowing
what
it
was
i
would
have
said
it
was
a
double
ipa
and
that
is
a
very
good
thing
it
is
like
biting
into
fresh
citrus
fruit
o
this
is
a
beer
to
experience
for
yourself
kiwi
rising
is
an
intensely
hoppy
lager
that
just
might
replace
your
favorite
dipa
this
beer
being
a
lager
gives
the
powerful
nz
hops
a
clean
vessel
to
ride
on
making
you
wonder
while
all
hoppy
beers
have
to
be
ales
a
must
try
for
the
hophead
had
this
on
tap
served
in
a
tulip
8oz
first
time
having
it
after
i
read
a
lot
of
great
things
about
it
if
i
could
sum
up
this
beer
in
one
word
it
would
be
beautiful
the
look
the
feel
the
tastebursting
with
a
citrusyfruity
start
and
ending
with
a
fair
bitterness
its
a
very
refreshing
beer
i
wanted
to
order
another
one
but
was
at
a
bar
with
105
beers
on
tap
so
i
wanted
to
keep
tasting
i
will
get
this
again
this
is
pretty
absurd
im
not
sure
why
or
how
i
can
still
be
surprised
by
jacks
abby
but
this
was
unexpectedly
good
its
kind
of
like
mass
rising
except
the
hop
profile
is
all
about
the
nelson
sauvin
hops
i
must
say
that
it
not
only
reminds
me
of
mass
rising
but
also
of
alpine
nelson
and
unlike
nelson
i
dont
have
to
trade
away
vital
organs
to
get
a
bottle
of
this
o
an
interesting
and
unique
beer
well
worth
a
try
the
oily
tinge
is
reminiscent
of
dirtwolf
but
not
as
offensive
as
when
i
first
tried
dirtwolf
and
as
an
imperial
lager
kiwi
rising
does
taste
a
bit
lighter
in
color
and
taste
than
dirtwolf
when
price
point
is
considered
dw
beats
kr
even
if
dw
is
around
114
when
you
can
find
it
now
thats
23
cents
an
ounce
as
opposed
to
28
cents
for
kr
oh
not
so
much
difference
after
all
but
dayum
they
taste
so
darned
similar
o
decent
beer
was
hoping
it
was
better
fresh
and
it
is
just
slightly
if
i
were
able
to
regularly
get
this
i
would
be
inclined
to
drink
this
every
so
often
overall
this
is
an
imperial
lager
that
could
go
toe
to
toe
with
any
imperial
ipa
really
shines
in
the
intense
hop
profile
yet
keeps
its
lager
roots
a
must
try
for
any
hophead
the
palate
opens
with
a
big
juicy
fruity
hop
character
light
tropical
airy
and
surprisingly
enough
like
a
kiwi
in
some
respects
really
though
this
is
a
blend
of
citron
mangosteen
and
a
little
pineapple
interestingly
enough
the
spiciness
that
i
picked
up
on
the
nose
isnt
particularly
noticeable
though
this
is
definitely
on
the
spicier
side
of
ipls
ive
had
the
mid
palate
brings
out
some
bitterness
with
a
blend
of
hand
of
buddhalike
brilliant
clarifying
brightness
and
a
very
focused
citrus
resin
bite
very
clean
this
beer
finishes
with
flavors
of
honey
simple
syrup
and
a
mild
bitterness
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
there
is
no
way
id
peg
this
at
8
malt
character
is
nonexistent
this
is
one
of
the
more
memorable
beers
ive
had
this
year
outrageously
good
i
have
been
wanting
to
try
their
beer
for
some
time
if
you
like
the
bite
of
hoppy
bitterness
this
is
a
fine
example
has
a
bite
from
beginning
to
end
very
good
dipl
pours
a
hazy
amber
with
a
thick
fluffy
head
minimal
lacing
lots
of
fruit
on
the
nose
citrus
tropical
fruit
with
a
hint
of
breadiness
and
fresh
cut
grass
some
cattiness
can
be
detected
not
such
a
bitter
bomb
on
the
palate
sweet
grapefruit
and
other
fruity
flavors
come
on
the
front
giving
way
to
some
bready
malt
and
tropical
fruit
nice
dry
finish
medium
light
body
with
decent
carbonation
overall
an
outstanding
double
ipl
supremely
well
crafted
well
worth
seeking
out
o
i
have
had
many
ipls
in
the
past
and
this
is
among
the
worst
ive
had
hoponus
union
is
a
much
better
beer
from
jacks
abby
there
was
no
balance
between
the
malt
and
hops
it
was
overcarbonated
and
tasted
stale
as
a
side
note
the
bottle
was
picked
up
from
the
brewery
about
11
days
before
it
was
consumed
i
dont
know
when
it
was
bottled
but
i
have
got
to
assume
that
the
brewery
would
only
release
fresh
ipls
a
definite
miss
from
jacks
abby
very
disappointing
i
have
no
idea
how
this
beer
got
onto
the
top
250
list
overall
another
great
lager
from
jacks
abby
these
guys
continue
to
impress

as
i
remember
nonetheless
well
worth

if
the
opportunity
presents
probably
my
favorite
jacks
abby
offering
well
worth
the
bargain
price
it
goes
for
another
great
india
pale
lager
from
jacks
abby
o
overall
i
like
it
a
lot
but
would
love
more
of
the
hops
to
be
featured
and
a
bit
less
malt
in
the
flavor
o
kiwi
rising
is
off
the
charts
an
absolute
hop
fest
with
an
incredible
clean
feel
jacks
abby
is
the
real
deal
and
they
need
to
be
recognized
as
the
future
of
hoppy
lagers
seek
this
out
while
you
can
youll
think
your
drinking
a
gal
named
susan
who
was
made
with
well
water
o
awesome
really
fantastic
hoppy
lager
cheers
o
ja
knocks
another
one
out
of
the
park
extremely
drinkable
for
8
5
even
with
the
high
amount
of
bitterness
throughout
definitely
worth
picking
up
deep
golden
color
that
is
nearly
transparent
with
a
huge
billowing
foamy
white
head
some
tropical
fruit
notes
but
mostly
citrus
rind
on
the
nose
there
is
a
bit
of
bright
citrus
and
fruit
on
the
first
taste
but
the
bitterness
overwhelms
after
that
the
body
is
very
clean
and
smooth
to
drink
overall
i
was
taken
aback
by
the
level
of
bitterness
on
this
beer
its
very
clean
and
wellmade
but
the
intense
bitterness
reminds
me
of
some
of
the
west
coast
ipas
that
arent
my
personal
favorites
had
on
tap
at
area
four
this
was
raved
about
by
the
waiter
and
so
highly
rated
i
was
anticipating
a
lot
i
like
this
brewery
poured
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
nice
head
hoppy
taste
hits
you
right
away
and
this
had
a
nice
smooth
balance
however
i
found
an
odd
after
taste
i
may
be
kicked
off
beer
advocate
but
i
didnt
like
this
found
it
difficult
to
finish
but
being
a
trooper
i
did
maybe
i
need
to
revisit
again
o
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
great
imperial
pilsner
it
looks
great
and
has
a
great
mouthfeel
and
is
very
drinkable
the
nose
was
good
though
a
little
different
than
i
was
expecting
due
to
some
nuts
in
the
smell
but
the
taste
was
fantastic
and
spot
on
tons
of
pine
and
citrus
hops
would
love
to
have
this
one
again
another
winner
from
ja
heard
both
good
and
not
so
good
things
about
this
brew
so
i
was
skeptical
especially
after
loving
ba
framinghammer
gotta
say
this
is
an
absolutely
exceptional
beer
the
aroma
fills
the
room
after
pouring
a
nice
1
inch
white
head
id
never
thought
id
use
the
description
of
grass
but
thats
a
great
descriptor
as
well
as
a
beautifully
well
balanced
ipl
great
hop
flavor
with
a
delicious
malt
back
bone
thrilled
that
jacks
abbey
is
here
in
ny
well
done
o
this
is
more
on
the
refreshing
side
of
the
double
ipal
spectrum
easy
to
drink
while
still
maintaining
a
hopforward
presence
and
bitterness
doesnt
dry
the
mouth
out
overall
quite
good
overall
really
well
balanced
and
super
high
drinkability
with
lots
of
fantastic
flavor
this
is
definitely
a
goto
ipa
really
refreshing
and
a
very
well
crafted
brew
o
i
like
most
of
jacks
abbys
products
and
this
is
certainly
one
of
them
i
would
recommend
and
seek
out
again

just

on

finished
with
a
touch
of
grain
and
some
lingering
slightly
vegetal
hops
overall
ive
waited
to
try
this
beer
since
last
year
and
im
glad
i
got
to
definantly
a
beer
ill
look
forward
to
getting
again
o
still
a
good
beer
but
i
would
love
to
try
a
fresh
one
extremely
clean
on
the

lots

flavor
wise
bitterness
is
very
low
but
theres
just
enough
to
feel
it
almost
like
orange
juice
with
a
beer
taste
one
of
the
smoothest
beers
over
8
ive
ever
had
i
love
this
to
think
i
nearly
avoided
this
brew
because
of
the
l
word
lager
on
the
label
glad
i
didnt
let
preconceptions
guide
me
o
interesting
definitely
good
i
couldnt
drink
a
ton
but
very
enjoyable
especially
with
food
probably
one
of
the
best
double
india
pale
lagers
ive
had
not
that
theres
too
many
of
them
out
there
compared
to
other
styles
ogot
this
unknown
bottle
as
an
extra
let
me
say
wow
i
am
impressed
i
really
enjoy
the
combination
of
these
styles
wish
i
had
more
cheers
overall
i
have
never
had
an
imperial
pilsner
before
the
hops
dont
really
give
this
beer
a
chance
to
be
a
regular
pilsner
but
i
dont
care
because
this
is
a
tasty
beer
this
is
my
second
favorite
jack
abbys
beer
and
they
make
some
wonderful
hoppy
beers
i
am
impressed
again
by
abby
jacks
but
hoponius
union
is
still
my
favorite
you
can
think
of
kiwi
rising
as
bigger
version
of
hoponius
union
my
favorite
aspect
of
this
beer
is
how
unique
the
hop
profile
is
its
true
unique
overall
this
is
most
certainly
a
powerful
double
ipa
and
you
wont
find
many
more
hop
flavors
crammed
into
a
single
bottle
of
beer
this
does
of
course
mean
that
many
casual
drinkers
will
find
the
beer
utterly
unpalatable
but
hopheads
should
rejoice
in
what
is
an
excellently
crafted
hop
profile
unfortunately
the
sugars
and
breads
arent
quite
capable
of
keeping
up
with
the
massive
lupulin
blast
making
the
beer
seem
offbalanced
worth
trying
but
be
aware
of
what
youre
getting
into
there
are
better
hoppy
lagers
from
jacks
abby
in
my
opinion
the
super
earthyveggiesweet
malt
is
not
my
top
preference
for
flavors
but
this
is
still
quite
good
impressive
complexity
big
thanks
goes
out
to
msquared2
for
sharing
this
one
during
one
of
our
random
sunday
tastings
served
from
bottle
into

15th
anniversary
snifter
poured
a
hazy
golden
yellow
with
a
half
finger
white
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
slowly
maintained
excellent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
fruit
citrus
citrus
hop
tropical
fruit
and
pineapple
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
fruit
tropical
fruit
tropical
fruit
hop
citrus
and
pine
hop
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
high
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
good
brew
another
brew
from
this
brewery
and
another
hit
everything
on
this
one
really
worked
in
complete
harmony
and
unison
to
make
it
very
easy
to
drink
and
refreshing
the
tropical
fruit
profile
going
on
was
nothing
short
of
awesome
on
this
one
so
glad
that
i
finally
found
out
about
this
brewery
i
hope
you
get
the
chance
to
do
the
same
overall
wow
this
is
a
very
impressive
beer
unique
flavorful
and
super
drinkable
a
very
tasty
hoppy
lager
that
id
be
very
happy
to
drink
again
i
will
drink
this
again
oi
liked
this
beer
a
lot
and
i
usually
hate
lagers
but
this
has
many
ipa
qualities
which
is
a
huge
benefit
for
me
it
is
pretty
tastey
looks
smells
great
and
had
a
real
good
mouthfeel
not
just
standard
local
fair
a
really
good
beer
and
it
reps
mass
well
a
very
bright
very
hoppy
beer
jacks
abbey
continues
to
impress
the
hell
outta
me
this
is
an
exceptional
beer
it
is
definitely
one
of
if
not
the
best
imperial
pils
i
have
had
the
huge
but
not
overwhelming
hop
aroma
and
flavor
combined
with
the
crisp
and
lighter
mouthfeel
make
this
beer
dangerously
drinkable
definitely
had
my
share
before
it
ran
out
this
year
overall
this
beer
is
better
than
nearly
every
dipa
ive
ever
had
just
a
stellar
beer
in
every
regard
jacks
abbey
hit
a
grand
slam
here
i
dont
want
this
again
i
need
this
again
a
good
take
all
around
drinks
like
a
burly
apa
but
that
lager
yeast
keeps
your
tongue
rooted
to
the
base
style
a
solid
hop
profile
but
the
malts
seem
a
little
weak
in
comparison
definitely
worth
checking
out
but
i
have
a
hard
time
believing
this
is
a
plinyheady
killer
o
definitely
good
but
im
not
sure
i
dont
like
hoponious
union
a
bit
better
jacks
abby
has
it
going
when
it
comes
to
lagers
and
hops
o
the
aroma
on
this
beer
is
incredible
so
much
fruitiness
the
taste
is
certainly
very
good
but
is
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
after
the
aroma
a
very
good
beer
in
an
odd
style
o
this
is
one
intense
beer
the
nose
is
softly
aromatic
and
pleasant
but
it
takes
a
little
while
to
open
up
and
doesnt
pop
as
it
perhaps
should
this
leaves
the
drinker
completely
unprepared
for
the
no
holds
barred
hop
onslaught
that
awaits
this
is
very
bitter
and
very
spicy
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
o
worldclass
dipl
doubt
ill
ever
have
one
as
tasty
as
this
in
love
with
this
beer
and
with
jacks
abby
m
medium
bodied
o
top
class
double
ipal
the
lager
and
nz
hop
qualities
put
this
beer
over
the
top
such
a
pleasure
to
drink
thank
you
jacks
abby
well
done
well
well
done
o
this
is
just
another
great
hoppy
beer
from
jacks
abby
glad
to
have
gotten
my
hands
on
a
few
bottles
and
hoping
to
make
it
to
the
brewery
in
the
near
future
in
hopes
they
still
have
it
there
if
not
ill
settle
for
hoponius
union
with
no
tears
shed
o
really
superlative
lager
one
of
the
best
jacks
abby
brews
and
they
are
all
world
class
this
beer
may
not
be
for
everyone
at
105
ibus
although
i
think
you
will
come
to
enjoy
it
a
curious
beer
indeed
are
they
trying
to
showcase
new
zealand
hops
or
lager
fermentation
i
think
the
answer
is
both
this
beer
is
drinkable
and
very
interesting
the
problem
is
that
there
is
absolutely
nothing
traditionally
lager
about
this
beer
and
its
not
a
deeply
satisfying
hopbomb
either
3
5
i
have
enjoyed
5
bottles
over
the
last
2
weeks
of
this
stuff
having
again
soon
the
finish
is
all
preventing
this
beer
from
being
about
as
perfect
as
possible
i
love
what
jacks
abby
is
doing
with
lagers
and
this
is
their
best
one
yet
its
like
a
dipa
bred
with
a
german
pils
amazing
o
flavors
are
good
on
this
beer
at
the
start
and
thru
the
middle
but
a
bit
lacking
on
the
finish
the
finish
really
doesnt
feel
like
it
is
inviting
me
to
take
another
sip
comes
across
very
bitter
dry
a
bit
medicinal
and
super
piney
a
softer
finish
with
some
sweetness
and
citrusy
fruit
would
go
along
way
for
me
here
i
havent
really
found
a
strong
liking
in
any
of
the
beers
using
new
zealand
hops
so
maybe
this
one
really
had
the
chips
stacked
against
a
bit
from
the
beginning
good
beer
but
still
lacking
that
something
to
make
it
special
flavor
wise
this
is
far
closer
to
a
double
ipa
than
a
double
pilsner
this
is
because
of
the
strong
citrus
hop
presence
very
bitter
even
up
front
long
aftertaste
of
black
pepper
relatively
thin
body
with
a
high
level
of
carbonation
o
another
great
beer
from
jacks
abby
glad
to
have
finally
tried
this
one
and
fruitier
version
of
hoponius
on
the
mouth
this
beer
feels
crisp
and
smooth
with
a
nice
bitter
bite
on
the
tongue
and
the
sides
of
the
mouth
the
mouth
is
left
wet
on
the
sides
while
the
roof
of
the
mouth
and
the
tongue
have
the
slight
scorch
of
a
bitter
burn
overall
this
beer
is
an
excellent
success
and
is
reminiscent
of
a
more
succulent
and
fruity
version
of
hoponius
union
great
big
bitter
hops
from
the
high
ibus
scrape
the
mouth
but
leave
it
begging
for
more
and
a
higher
alcohol
percentage
that
is
not
present
in
the
taste
at
all
i
was
a
little
worried
about
this
beer
after
trying
it
at
the
end
of
a
tasting
last
week
and
having
it
taste
bland
and
uninteresting
but
i
now
can
safely
say
that
was
because
of
all
the
beer
before
it
that
i
had
tried
this
beer
is
a
winner
very
easy
to
put
back
with
terrific
clean
and
crisp
lager
qualities
while
carrying
the
big
juicy
fruit
bitters
of
a
west
coast
imperial
ipa
this
beer
is
a
must
try
especially
for
its
super
cheap
pricing
o
really
nice
dipa
err
dipl
whatever
you
want
to
call
this
stuff
its
fantastic
stuff
but
thats
nothing
new
for
jacks
abby
this
is
a
delicious
beer
with
a
great
aroma
it
reminds
me
a
lot
of
hill
farmstead
edward
but
with
a
thinner
body
i
hope
this
becomes
a
more
than
seasonal
brew
o
awesome
brew
i
dont
think
jacks
abby
can
make
a
bad
beer
a
big
mean
dry
hopped
lager
monster
yes
they
do
exist
4
overall
this
is
an
awesome
beer
very
glad
my
girlfriend
picked
this
one
out
at
the
store
brewing
this
as
a
lager
opposed
to
an
ale
was
a
great
idea
pretty
unique
and
it
worked
out
well
definitely
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
to
date
thats
come
out
of
my
home
state
of
ma
ive
only
had
a
few
imperial
lagers
most
are
called
imperial
pinslers
but
hey
a
pilsner
is
a
lager
this
is
one
of
the
better
ones
its
delicate
well
balanced
yet
at
the
same
time
strong
i
like
it
a
lot
and
wish
it
was
more
available
but
i
can
imagine
its
not
an
easy
one
to
brew
odthe
double
india
pale
lager
is
better
than
9095
of
the
dipas
i
have
had
i
love
the
nelson
sauvin
hop
still
pretty
certain
this
is
the
correct
varietal
and
i
love
how
they
utilized
its
flavors
in
this
beer
jacks
abby
is
the
best
brewery
in
ma
and
is
up
there
with
the
best
in
the
country
in
my
opinion
dont
let
their
specific
nichebrewing
deter
you
these
lagers
are
unequivocally
world
class
o
i
love
this
beer
my
fav
this
far
from
jacks
abby
and
deffinatly
up
there
with
my
favorite
dipas
nice
dry
and
loads
of
tropical
fruitpiney
hops
if
you
love
hops
this
beer
is
a
must
try
world
class
beer
no
joke
do
this
year
round
please
overall
great
drinkability
everyone
with
me
drank
several
had
it
last
year
on
draft
and
was
excited
for
its
return
and
soon
in
bottles
thankfully
it
lived
up
to
my
expectations
this
is
my
favorite
jacks
abby
beer
by
a
good
margin
highly
doubt
there
is
a
better
lager
out
there
glad
to
see
a
very
local
brewery
making
a
hoppy
but
unique
beer
doesnt
just
emulate
your
usual
iipa
the
hops
here
are
smooth
and
fruity
flavorful
d
its
the
alpine
nelson
of
lagers
i
think
i
liked
hoponius
union
a
tiny
bit
more
but
this
is
excellent
as
well
i
hope
they
make
this
year
round
as
its
a
beer
id
drink
often
its
really
nice
to
see
brewers
pushing
the
lager
boundaries
too
o
easy
to
drink
thick
with
a
good
hoppy
flavor
worth
checking
out
if
youre
into
a
hoppy
chance
of
pace
holy
crap
jacks
abbey
is
the
real
deal
this
beer
easily
holds
its
own
with
the
resin
hop
monsters
out
there
its
only
a
matter
of
time
till
this
local
brewery
is
nationally
known
overall
this
beer
is
really
flavorful
but
it
could
use
a
touch
more
sweetness
for
balance
there
is
some
subtle
heat
in
the
finish
but
i
was
shocked
to
see
that
the
abv
is
so
high
fuller
bodied
than
expected
for
the
style
but
still
pretty
quaffable
i
would
love
to
try
this
again
in
the
summer
overall
this
is
a
really
good
hoppy
beer
i
was
very
surprised
when
i
found
out
the
style
i
would
definitely
have
another
a
curious
looking
bottle
found
its
way
home
with
me
yesterday
pours
a
cloudy
deep
straw
color
bordering
on
golden
with
a
decent
white
head
that
displays
minimal
retention
and
lace
smell
comes
through
with
lots
of
citrus
with
grapefruit
and
lemon
dominating
moderate
pilsner
malt
deep
underneath
taste
is
quite
hoppy
lots
of
citrus
with
barely
any
malt
to
back
it
up
medium
body
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
and
a
resinous
mouthfeel
great
hoppy
brew
and
a
great
price
too
i
may
have
to
revisit
this
again
this
is
my
third
time
trying
a
beer
by
jacks
abby
brewing
and
all
have
been
outstanding
it
is
truly
amazing
how
they
got
this
lager
to
resemble
a
flavorful
and
dry
yet
remarkably
well
balanced
west
coaststyle
double
ipa
expect
to
see
other
breweries
doing
something
similar
in
the
near
future
o
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
most
interesting
beers
ive
had
lately
i
almost
passed
on
it
due
to
the
lager
label
but
im
glad
i
didnt
its
85
like
a
big
dipa
if
i
didnt
know
it
was
a
lager
i
would
have
assumed
it
was
a
dipa
in
fact
doesnt
beat
you
up
too
badly
despite
the
high
hoppiness
making
is
surprisingly
drinkable
i
think
i
could
have
more
than
one
of
these
which
is
more
than
i
could
say
for
a
ruination
maharaja
or
a
hopsickle
o
the
second
beer
ive
had
from
these
guys
and
damn
does
it
raise
a
bar
i
felt
was
already
pretty
high
in
the
end
i
really
enjoyed
this
its
clean
direct
flavorful
however
i
think
i
prefer
mass
rising
which
has
a
more
juicy
tropical
flavor
to
it
overall
delicious
hard
to
get
and
lager
flavors
but
got
a
little
as
i
really
tried
great
tropical
fruit
hops
citrus
a
bit
resinous
nice
soft
malt
balance
very
drinkable
esp
for
8
5
carbonation
is
an
easy
fix
so
i
will
still
give
kiwi
rising
a
big
thumbs
up
o
overall
i
like
this
beer
so
much
i
cant
stand
up
from
the
bar
in
fear
of
being
arrested
for
indecent
exposure
what
the
hell
guys
why
why
make
a
beer
this
good
this
surprising
if
lagering
an
ipa
turns
it
into
this
symphony
then
all
breweries
should
play
these
notes
i
would
drink
this
over
any
nondark
beet
any
day
of
the
week
this
is
truey
something
magical
get
this
while
it
lasts
everyone
because
as
cinderella
said
you
dont
know
what
youve
got
till
its
gone
was
at
the
local
pub
tonight
ordered
this
on
draft
shweeet
i
had
no
idea
what
i
was
ordering
except
that
i
generally
like
all
of
jacks
abbey
brews
holy
cow
it
was
good
i
have
to
say
ive
never
seen
a
beer
that
looks
like
this
pineapple
yellow
and
murky
as
fk
small
white
head
that
leaves
decent
lacing
smells
of
strong
sweet
and
bitter
hops
wonderful
citrusy
pineapple
favors
with
sharp
evergreen
aftertaste
strong
good
will
definitely
seek
this
out
again
pineapple
aroma
huge
citrus
punch
and
a
bitter
pine
finish
this
is
the
best
ipl
hands
down
taste
hop
forward
pungent
smooth
medium
body
aggressive
bitterness
grapefruit
rind
peppery
warming
faint
nuttiness
underlying
breadiness
pithy
freshcut
grass
herbal
juicy
drying
bitter
finish
deep
golden
color
with
an
off
white
head
that
builds
thick
and
laces
great
smell
is
of
biscuit
citrus
pulp
and
zest
great
aroma
but
a
bit
subdued
taste
is
light
biscuit
backbone
carrying
great
citrus
zesty
flavors
crisp
feel
with
an
initial
zip
that
breaks
and
goes
creamy
on
the
palate
great
beer
very
drinkable
at
8
and
great
flavor
almost
a
wheatipa
had
the
hops
i
love
but
had
a
drop
of
lemon
similar
to
a
wheat
beer
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
very
nice
ipl
hoppy
with
the
perfect
malt
for
the
balance
smooth
and
creamy
feel
very
interesting
stuff
a
little
too
sweet
for
me
but
otherwise
a
fantastic
beer
would
love
to
try
this
on
a
hot
summer
morning
next
to
a
nice
spicy
bloody
mary
jacks
abby
continues
to
amaze
me
with
what
they
can
do
with
their
lagers
try
this
one
without
hesitation
eh
i
guess
i
dont
like
lagers
o
very
good
beer
they
make
hoppy
lagers
like
nobodies
business
i
wonder
what
one
of
their
straight
up
ipas
would
be
like
fantastically
fruity
and
great
mouth
feel
overall
a
great
beer
and
probably
my
favorite
from
jacks
abby
so
far
really
like
how
the
lager
yeast
and
lagering
affected
the
dipa
flavors
and
made
a
crisper
cleaner
but
still
massively
hoppy
beer
its
young
nephew
hoponius
does
quite
well
for
himself
he
obviously
doesnt
take
after
uncle

offering
overall
a
delicious
sessionable
lager
that
sneaks
in
fantastic
hop
flavor
and
relatively
high
alcohol
content
id
drink
this
any
day
of
the
week
this
is
what
an
ipl
is
supposed
to
be
this
is
the
king
of
ipls
no
other
comes
close
to
this
in
aroma
taste
look
and
feel
it
gives
you
all
the
amazing
characteristics
of
a
world
class
ipa
but
with
the
lightness
and
stunning
crystal
clear
picture
perfect
quality
of
a
pilsner
if
you
can
get
a
hold
of
this
beer
do
so
this
beer
is
very
pilsner
like
with
the
malts
and
the
hop
aromas
flavors
and
bitterness
are
pleasant
and
abundant
a
fantastic
iipa
light
body
with
active
carbonation
taste
is
very
happy
and
fruity
smooth
with
a
citrus
finish
its
a
step
up
from
the
harsh
imbalance
of
kiwi
but
i
still
think
it
doesnt
work
as
well
as
hoponious
the
lager
yeastheavy
hopping
combo
creates
a
shrill
effect
losing
hold
of
the
malt
character
isnt
super
surprising
for
the
style
but
without
it
here
the
shrillness
is
especially
stark
wouldnt
reach
for
this
deferring
instead
to
the
aforementioned
hoponious
or
another
more
balanced
option
from
ja
one
of
the
best
pilsners
out
there
overall
well
made
beer
totally
enjoyable
i
would
seek
this
on
out
again
for
sure
great
everyday
ipl
jacks
abbey
has
solidified
their
spot
at
the
top
of
ipl
makers
creamy
first
sip
as
the
head
dissolves
nice
lacing
on
glass
hoppy
experience
througout
not
my
traditional
beer
style
but
glad
i
tried
this
one
excellent
smooth
hoppy
beer
that
is
exceptionally
balanced
you
can
drink
this
all
day
long
overall
this
is
a
nice
full
bodied
double
ipl
with
ample
hop
flavor
not
the
most
complex
but
great
for
what
it
is
it
sb
noted
that
this
beer
is
a
double
ipl
and
not
a
pilsner
very
good
ipl
happy
with
my
first
ja
beer
overall
an
interesting
tasting
beer
for
me
this
tastes
like
a
nice
session
beer
with
a
high
abv
i
would
like
more
i
like
it
a
lot
this
beer
has
won
me
over
when
i
first
had
this
beer
i
didnt
put
this
beer
up
there
with
kiwi
rising
but
i
put
them
both
right
up
there
with
each
other
mass
rising
has
a
nice
strong
hoppy
smell
to
it
very
distinct
taste
and
smell
such
a
great
beer
excellent
o
fresh
and
hoppy
with
the
drink
ability
of
a
lager
another
winner
f
light
carbonation
my
favorite
india
pale
lager
although
often
is
represented
as
a
pilsner
great
drinkability
while
still
8
must
try
for
ipl
fans
best
beer
ive
ever
had
no
but
the
best
lager
ive
ever
had
by
far
hence
a
high
rating
number
one
in
that
class
bottom
line
the
brews
good
o
tasty
goes
down
very
easily
not
too
filling
good
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
very
flavorful
beer
worth
drinking
for
a
long
time
this
is
a
mix
between
a
double
ipa
hoppiness
combined
with
a
double
lagerpilsner
body
very
drinkable
beer
good
hop
nose
not
my
kind
of
brew
but
one
of
the
better
ipls
ive
had
pours
hazy
yellow
with
a
fluffy
white
head
big
time
lemony
aroma
here
with
some
grassy
pine
to
go
along
with
a
hint
of
pineapple
and
honey
the
flavor
is
lots
of
lemon
bitter
hops
a
bit
of
pine
some
fruits
and
low
sweetness
from
the
malts
finishes
smooth
but
with
a
funky
note
left
on
the
palate
high
carbonation
light
or
medium
body
super
easy
drinking
and
slightly
dry
overall
extremely
solid
and
dangerously
crushable
this
is
really
good
beer
pick
up
a
sixer
if
you
can
get
it
it
has
the
hoppiness
of
a
good
ipa
but
its
significantly
smoother
it
doesnt
have
that
biting
astringincey
really
well
balanced
just
a
hint
of
sweetness
remarkably
drinkable
at
8
overall
i
liked
this
a
lot
i
thought
it
was
really
good
and
had
an
amazing
nose
to
it
easy
to
drink
and
worth
checking
out
would
drink
this
all
the
time
if
i
could
a
great
ipl
that
i
would
love
to
have
regular
access
to
overall
a
little
bitter
for
my
palette
somewhat
astringent
and
the
herbals
are
a
tad
medicinal
but
sometimes
you
need
your
medicine
im
impressed
that
this
is
a
lager
o
i
would
bet
that
few
could
tell
this
apart
from
some
of
the
best
ipas
on
the
shelf
i
almost
thought
i
was
indulging
on
a
toppling
goliath
ipa
for
a
moment
unique
nose
with
citrus
maybe
pine
caramel
smooth
all
the
way
through
tip
of
the
tongue
finish
o
i
liked
this
beer
but
wish
it
had
more
complexity
it
is
a
onetrick
pony
flavorwise
but
it
does
that
trick
with
noble
hopping
well
jacks
abbey
clearly
knows
their
lagers
and
this
is
a
good
example
of
an
extreme
lager
very
solid
offering
o
this
is
a
really
enjoyable
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
clean
and
crisp
there
are
malt
and
grass
notes
that
make
the
taste
very
nice
i
was
worried
about
the
bitterness
at
100
ibus
but
it
was
nicely
balanced
also
the
8
abv
was
hidden
well
on
tap
at
the
worthy
burger
deep
straw
color
and
attractive
in
the
glass
a
thin
but
attractive
head
and
great
thick
and
lasting
lacing
a
light
scent
of
hops
and
citrus
nothing
heavy
or
overwhelming
feels
light
and
drinkable
with
well
masked
alcohol
a
citrus
pallet
and
bitter
finish
an
excellent
ipl
from
ja
really
impressed
with
this
ipl
in
fact
the
best
one
i
have
tasted
this
would
be
a
go
to
brew
if
available
in
oh
nice
job
by
jacks
abby
thanks
to
jlindros
pours
a
bright
yellow
gold
color
its
quite
transparent
theres
some
sediment
at
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
but
a
gentleish
pour
didnt
disturb
it
and
cloud
things
up
big
puffy
white
head
lots
of
lacing
big
clumps
on
the
walls
of
the
glass
excellent
retention
floral
and
citric
hop
aroma
pale
bready
malt
sweetness
some
peach
white
grape
mango
its
all
a
bit
mild
though
and
really
could
be
juicier
surprisingly
little
lager
yeastiness
taste
is
similar
some
lemon
peach

particularly
for
the
abv
pretty
good
beer
o
i
was
underwhelmed
by
this
one
it
was
good
and
definitely
drinkable
but
it
wasnt
the
best
of
the
few
other
hoppy
lagers
ive
had
from
ja
o
really
nice
a
lot
of
hop
flavor
o
a
nice
refreshing
beer
for
being
8
several
ipls
have
left
me
with
a
sensation
of
something
missing
but
not
this
one
recommended
highly
o
the
hops
adjusted
version
of
their
second
anniversary
lager
which
i
rated
4
26
last
august
has
hops
enough
to
satisfy
most
hopheads
just
as
its
predecessor
did
i
enjoyed
it
more
when
the
flavor
turned
from
piney
to
more
citrus
overall
another
fantastic
beer
from
jacks
abby
if
these
guys
distributed
to
my
area
i
would
certainly
drink
a
lot
more
of
the
styles
from
the
lager
method
of
brewing
glad
that
sammyjaxxx
has
been
kind
enough
to
share
the
wealth
thanks
mj0126
for
the
opportunity
overall
nice
ipl
this
is
a
medium
to
light
bodied
brew
with
modest
carbonation
it
is
full
of
hop
flavor
and
quite
nice
somewhat
crisp
and
easy
drinking
this
is
worth
seeking
out
overall
a
solid
dipa
but
i
prefer
hoponius
union
this
is
its
bigger
brother
that
just
got
outshined
by
its
sibling
hazy
opaque
yellowish
golden
colored
beer
judging
this
as
a
lager
should
be
clearer
egg
whites
is
what
the
head
looks
like
not
tight
carbonation
but
pretty
plenty
of
lacing
aroma
is
big
pine
lemon
pinesol
pithy
citrus
what
more
can
be
said
the
aroma
blasts
out
of
the
glass
and
is
the
strongest
aspect
of
this
beer
tastes
good
hoppy
in
the
citrus
and
pine
variety
way
with
a
slight
grassy
quality
married
with
hidden
sulfur
clean
malt
profile
the
hops
lead
the
way
somewhat
one
dimensional
in
taste
and
a
slight
let
down
medium
bodied
medium
carbonation
medium
all
the
way
around
in
the
mouthfeel
category
clean
clean
finish
slight
bitter
hop
but
with
the
clean
palate
expected
of
a
lagered
beer
the
finish
is
another
strong
aspect
of
this
beer
its
good
period
o
this
is
one
serious
dipl
the
l
only
for
the
fact
that
it
is
fermented
with
lager
yeast
however
this
is
nothing
but
a
triedand
true
dipa
in
all
aspects
jacks
abby
continues
to
break
the
barriers
and
twist
our
yes
us
the
craft
beer
aficionados
definition
of
the
l
word
that
we
so
up
until
now
herald
as
the
bane
of
our
existence
however
we
should
release
those
shackles
and
rejoice
in
the
beauty
of
what
our
bottomfermenting
microorganisms
can
achieve
with
proper
care
and
proper
hopping

good

and
one
of
the
mainstays
when
one
thinks
of
an

venture
into

i
hope

very
good
ipa
i
really
like
the
beers
that
jacks

is
bringing
to
market
another
great

saved
my
growler
and
i
will
have
it
refilled
soon
o
spectacular
ipl
lots

and
slightly
caught
off

this
has
to
be
one
of
my
favorite
ipas
well
ipls
it
blows
most
ipas
out
of
the

its
just
so
crisp

drinkable
that
its
a
true
pioneer
of
the
style
nearly
perfect

i

zero

detected
another
home
run
for

abby
a
delicious
take
on
a
double
pilsner
to
make
this
beer
really
stand
out
id
love
to
see
a
continuation
of
the
texture
which
was
pillowy
before
the
alcohol
heat
kicked
in
mass
rising
is
a
solid
beer
the
sweetness
is
a
little
higher
than
id
like
but
besides
that
its
an
interesting
combination
of
robust
pilsner
and
heavy
hopping
i
would
happily
give
a
couple
more
of
these
a
try
in
the
future
thanks
again
mark
o
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
i
think
the
single
ipl
is
way
better
than
the
double
pours
a
hazy
straw
yellow
orangeish
color
with
a
compact
white
head
of
medium
bubbles
the
smell
is
dominated
by
the
hops
a
mix
of
citrus
fruit
notes
grapefruit
rind
lemon
some
lime
orange
rind
there
are
also
some
hints
of
pine
smells
like
a
west
coast
ipa
to
me
taste
follows
the
smell
though
there
is
a
strong
sweet
malty
base
to
the
beer
that
has
strong
honeylike
qualities
i
picked
up
on
more
lemon
than
i
had
expected
though
grapefruit
rind
dominated
a
little
pepper
at
the
close
which
i
think
comes
from
the
lager
yeast
finishes
dry
and
pleasant
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
big
and
smooth
for
the
style
though
there
is
medium
carbonation
as
with
everything
else
ive
had
from
jacks
abby
i
really
quite
enjoyed
this
starting
off
with
the
nose
there
is
big
hop
citrus
aroma
that
transitions
right
into
the
taste
the
taste
and
feel
of
this
feel
are
an
awesome
combo
taste
consists
of
big
citrus
flavors
a
slight
bit
of
grapefuit
and
a
nice
dry
malt
backbone
the
lager
aspect
gives
this
beer
a
smooth
crisp
taste
that
makes
this
extremely
drinkable
the
amazing
citrus
hop
taste
and
smoothness
of
this
beer
has
instantly
made
this
one
my
favorites
just
a
great
beer
jacks
abby
proves
that
bottom
ferment
can
do
just
as
well
what
top
ferment
can
do
highest
recommendation
better
than
their
flagship
hoponius
union
this
is
a
hop
bomb
with
plenty
of
grapefruit
rind
style
bitterness
theres
seemingly
no
malt
base
the
swallow
is
lip
puckeringly
bitter
giving
this
beer
a
very
long
aftertaste
the
body
is
heavy
for
a
pilsner
but
the
higher
combination
makes
it
feel
appropriate
o
excellent
cheers
oh
man
this
is
awesome
im
a
huge
fan
of
crisp
refreshing
lagers
and
to
get
one
that
embodies
its
mouthfeel
and
uses
intense
hopping
and
fruity
yeast
often
found
in
ales
to
elevate
its
complexity
is
a
job
well
done
indeed
in
a
way
this
is
like
the
lager
counterpart
to
pte
if
only
a
little
less
refined
i
do
hope
that
more
breweries
work
on
developing
the
ipl
style
as
ambitiously
as
jacks
abby
has
the
results
are
quite
terrific
and
are
among
the
most
intriguing
offerings
in
american
craft
beer
o
ive
yet
to
have
a
bad
beer
by
these
guys
im
super
impressed
by
each
and
every
one
of
their
offerings
theyre
the
only
brewery
i
buy
every
single
new
beer
i
see
without
hesitation
because
i
know
its
going
to
be
good
highly
recommended
what
ja
lacks
in
bottle
art
they
more
than
make
up
for
in
brewing
chops
mass
rising
is
good
as
the
best
stuff
theyve
put
out
jacks
abby
has
yet
to
disappoint
they
brew
drinkable
and
usually
sessionable
craft
lagers
for
someone
who
doesnt
consider
myself
as
a
lager
fan
i
am
a
huge
fan
of
what
jacks
abby
is
doing
and
suspect
that
this
and
others
in
the
portfolio
will
be
regulars
in
my
fridge
now
that
i
can
easily
get
them
overall
the
hop
flavor
isnt
very
distinct
the
malt
flavor
is
still
interesting
though
citric
and
hop
forward
imperial
lager
more
grapefruit
lime
and
orange
unflinchingly
hoppy
crisp
and
quite
enjoyable
well
worth
a
try
if
the
label
didnt
insist
i
wouldnt
even
notice
the
lager
yeast
its
subsumed
by
layers
of
tastiness
hops
tame
the
carbonation
this
would
be
excellent
as
is
an
easydrinking
very
good
beer
overall
me
likey
this
double
imperial
smelled
great
but
the
flavor
was
a
tad
lesser
that
what
i
smelled
i
could
drink
several
of
these
every
day
o
a
really
nice
beer
i
wish
i
got
this
around
here
to
get
regularly
o
a
pretty
good
beer
though
the
lighter
qualities
of
the
beer
do
little
to
hide
the
aggressive
alcoholic
qualities
of
the
beer
that
said
i
am
typically
not
a
fan
of
the
imperial
pilsner
style
and
while
i
am
not
entirely
sure
this
was
brewed
to
be
in
imperial
pilsner
i
can
say
this
is
my
favorite
example
of
the
style
that
ive
come
across
im
an
ipa
guy
not
a
lager
guy
but
bumping
the
ibus
to
100
seemed
to
kind
of
work
i
would
choose
this
over
many
standard
ipas
out
there
but
prefer
the
65
ibus
of
their
hoponius
union
over
this
the
beers
seemed
identical
with
welcomed
less
bitterness
at
65
ibu
i
am
not
a
big
ipa
fan
but
i
found
this
india
pale
lager
to
be
quite
refreshing
the
flavor
was
crisp
and
citrusy
it
was
hoppy
but
it
didnt
smack
you
in
the
face
and
leave
you
with
the
bitter
after
taste
totally
recommend
for
those
of
us
that
are
a
little
skittish
of
ipas
this
is
a
delicious
hoppy
lager
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
but
certainly
piney
with
citrus
rind
scenttaste
surprisingly
smooth
given
the
abv
and
intense
hop
bill
really
clean
mouthfeel
and
base
like
all
from
jacks
abby
great
standard
bearer
for
them
here
overall
im
lovin
it
fresh
hop
flavor
with
a
rich
lager
backbone
give
this
one
a
shot
warning
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
on
this
one
i
found
myself
getting
a
bit
sloppy
half
way
through
the
growler
without
even
realizing
it
whoops
mouthfeel
is
pretty
freaking
awesome
hard
light
to
medium
bodied
and
a
great
carbonation
level
perfect
anytime
beer
perfect
amount
of
bitterness
from
the
hops
this
beer
starts
slightly
sweet
has
a
nice
smooth
feel
with
a
dry
earthy
snappy
finish
crazy
drinkable
like
almost
anything
from
jacks
abby
you
most
certainly
wouldnt
think
this
beer
was
an
8er
goes
down
quick
this
one
almost
needs
to
be
in
the
bigger
bottles
this
amount
is
barely
enough
great
beer
overall
another
great
hoppy
lager
from
jacks
abby
which
is
becoming
one
of
my
local
favorites
once
again
this
brewer
nails
to
perfection
the
look
constant
stream
of
tiny
bubbles
race
up
a
clear
gold
body
huge
head
remarkably
white
that
is
foamy
and
whipped
almost
like
meringue
aroma
is
strong
on
the
peaches
grassy
piney
hops
fleshy
tropical
fruit
flavor
is
lush
lots
of
fruit
hoppy
yet
flavor
shines
rather
than
the
bitterness
which
plays
a
supporting
role
solid
stuff
here
and
i
will
be
grabbing
more
from
this
brewer
for
sure
pours
a
very
clear
golden
color
minimal
head
on
my
pour
starting
to
see
some
nice
lacing
though
smells
outstanding
tropical
fruits
passion
fruit
citrus
taste
isnt
as
tropical
as
the
smell
very
good
though
a
bit
of
pine
and
grass
and
pleasant
bitterness
on
the
end
bitter
grapefruit
rind
not
a
lot
of
carbonation
here
very
thin
and
drinkable
second
time
having
his
brew
thought
i
remembered
there
being
more
orange
flavor
i
wish
i
could
get
the
flavor
from
the
nose
its
a
great
aroma
this
beer
does
not
have
too
much
obvious
fruity
notes
from
the
hops
but
still
has
that
hop
juice
flavor
extremely
hoppy
very
clean
and
bitter
very
drinkable
bright
gold
with
a
bit
of
haze
apparent
as
it

with

sweetness
spicylemon
up
front
with
lingering
bitterness
and
alcohol
warmth
medium
plus
body
with
moderate
carbonation
good
texture
a
solid
beer
with
lots
of
hop
character
that
still
felt
refined
in
its
excesses
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
for
8
well
balanced
and
quite
tasty
o
i
fear
i
may
have
neglected
to
drink
this
beer
at
its
prime
however
i
had
a
hoponius
union
that
i
bought
at
the
same
time
and
it
was
fine
this
may
have
been
on
the
shelf
longer
i
am
not
sure
what
i
am
sure
of
is
that
i
liked
the
hoponius
union
much
better
regardless
this
is
my
celebration
of
national
lager
day
o
overall
a
great
delicious
beer
very
pleased
with
what
i
am
drinking
the
fact
that
it
is
8
is
a
plus
thanks
to
mj0126
for
the
trade
pours
a
clear
with
a
thick
3finger
white
head
good
retention
and
lots
of
lacing
aromas
of
tropical
fruit
and

lots
of
citrus
pine
and
tropical
fruit
on
the
tongue
finishes
dry
smooth
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
lots
of
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
very
impressive
double
pilsner
well
balanced
very
hop
forward
im
not
usually
a
fan
of
lagers
but
this
one
is
worth
seeking
out
overall
they
tweaked
the
2nd
anniversary
lager
and
made
it
even
better
they
continue
to
improve
on
this
style
and
recipe
and
i
am
all
in
o
obviously
extremely
similar
to
the
original
2nd
anniversary
beer
but
its
slightly
more
drinkable
definitely
backs
up
the
statement
on
the
label
that
states
that
its
extra
hoppy
the
100
ibus
are
definitely
right
up
front
and
in
your
face
this
one
will
either
get
you
hooked
on
lagers
or
extremely
hoppy
beers
not
that
many
people
arent
already
hooked
on
the
latter
another
winner
from
jacks
abby
really
creative
and
nontraditional
lagers
coming
from
them
the
beer
is
mostly
clear
and
golden
with
a
halfinch
of
white
head
the
aroma
offers
dank
citrus
hops
oo
smells
nice
grapefruit
and
oranges
with
a
dry
finish
bold
and
exciting
delicious
some
sourbread
and
yeast
notes
blend
beautifully
with
a
predominantly
hoppy
beer
i
definitely
recommend
this
drink
fresh
o
hop
forward
lager
pretty
dirty
grass
and
earth
pours
a
hazy
light
orange
with
a
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
citrus
fruit
citrus
zest
and
some
earthy
hop
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
citrus
zest
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
is
tasty
but
has
a
slightly
better
hop
aroma
in
my
opinion
solid
tasty
hoppy
beer
very
good
o
very
interesting
mix
of
hops
and
lager
good
complexity
great
beer
overall
a
solid
brew
im
glad
to
have
tried
and
would
definitely
drink
again
could
have
toned
down
the

a

but
otherwise
really
nice
overall
another
excellent
hoppy
lager
from
jacks
abby
every
time
i
drink
a
beer
from
jacks
abby
i
feel
more
pride
about
being
born
and
raised
in
massachusetts
this
beer
is
quite
remarkable
its
not
perfect
but
it
really
pushes
the
boundaries
of
stereotypes
associated
with
lagers
so
so
hoppy
it
becomes
borderline
abrasive
but
not
definitely
worth
seeking
out
pours
a
golden
hazy
pale
hue
allowing
some
light
to
penetrate
a
fluffy
long
lasting
head
rests
on
top
aroma
of
juicy
guava
and
mosaicgalaxy
resembling
tropical
fruit
quality
light
bitter
grass
backing
semisweet
pale
grains
to
go
along
with
the
preceding
a
touch
catty
all
around
fresh
and
nice
flavored
are
a
continuation
of
the
same
with
sweet
grains
upfront
that
quickly
dry
out
with
a
pithy
bitterness
seedy
tropical
fruit
note
abundant
pretty
clean
with
a
nice
balance
between
a
bigger
lager
grain
presence
and
an
assertively
well
hopped
offering
medium
bodied
with
adequate
carbonation
overall
a
great
beer
pair
it
with
some
good
cheese
meadow
creeks
grayson
would
be
great
for
a
nice
treat
taste
is
a
peek
of
sweet
maltiness
to
start
pine
hops
in
the
middle
and
bitterness
carries
through
the
close
hops
burps
are
immediate
mouthfeel
is
soft
and
smooth
with
easy
drinkability
worthy
of
being
an
anniversary
brew
overall
one
of
the
better
pilsners
ive
tasted
unique
flavorful
balanced
and
big
not
my
ideal
style
but
jacks
is
doing
a
phenomenal
job
with
it
i
really
respect
their
talent
as
well
as
this
brew
in
particular
o
very
good
for
sure
buti
wish
i
would
have
tried
this
2
months
ago
overall
an
excellent
beer
in
my
opinion
a
big
brother
to
2nd
anniversary
not
quite
the
same
maybe
a
more
mature
version
loads
of
aroma
wellbalanced
flavors
and
pretty
easy
drinking
mass
rising
is
another
excellent
offering
from
the
boys
at
jacks
abby
while
this
beer
might
not
be
quite
on
the
same
level
as
their
2nd
anniversary
lager
it
is
an
amazingly
flavorful
and
remarkably
quaffable
double
ipl
overall
4
25
this
one
isnt
quite
as
fruity
and
juicy
as
hoponious
union
and
not
quite
as
pithybitter
as
the
abcs
but
man
this
is
still
a
damn
good
hoppy
lager
its
lean
lemony
sneaky
dry
way
too
easy
and
just
damn
good
jacks
abby
has
kind
of
defined
the
ipl
substyle
and
between
this
and
the
other
two
aforentioned
beers
theyve
made
me
a
believer
i
still
havent
had
mass
rising
or
kiwi
rising
but
man
i
can
say
that
i
absolutely
look
forward
to
the
day
that
i
try
them
overall
great
another
amazing
beer
from
jacks
abby
but
this
time
getting
into
the
realm
of
hill
farmstead
of
tree
house
with
the
amazing
hop
characters
tropical
fruit
etc
but
keeping
that
nice
crisp
soft
lager
base
to
make
this
a
winner
and
a
half
o
great
ipalager
i
dont
care
what
it
is
i
just
know
it
was
damn
tasty
o
another
great
dipl
from
jacks
abbey
big
bitter
hops
with
a
light
crackery
malt
leads
to
a
crisp
and
sharp
brew
surprisingly
drinkable
though
their
lagering
work
tends
to
see
to
that
its
a
jacks
abby
aggressively
hopped
lager
which
means
its
damn
tasty
pulls
back
on
the
bitterness
of
2nd
anniversary
and
makes
a
more
drinkable
beer
poured
into
a
13
oz
tulip
glass
bottled
recently
for
sure
pours
a
straw
yellow
with
an
enormous
billowing
white
head
that
leaves
incredible
lace
everywhere
smell
extremely
tropical
and
floral
tangerine
pineapple
mango
grapefruit
and
flowers
taste
is
even
better
everything
in
the
nose
but
even
more
assertive
citrus
flowers
and
grapefruit
in
the
aggressive
finish
body
is
medium
perfect
carbonation
a
little
dry
and
very
easy
drinking
this
is
scary
good
wow
overall
this
is
a
very
impressive
ipl
delicious
hop
flavors
and
a
wonderfully
smooth
body
combine
to
make
this
a
really
refreshing
beer
with
a
whole
lot
of
flavor
ive
had
the
2nd
anniversary
lager
and
to
me
this
one
beats
that
one
for
sure
although
both
are
great
o
i
hope
that
jacks
abby
continues
to
brew
this
recipe
the
wonderful
flavors
met
me
right
away
with
a
lingering
piney
bitterness
that
held
my
attention
throughout
i
started
to
feel
the
alcohol
in
my
face
about
halfway
through
but
never
tasted
its
presence
these
probably
wont
be
around
for
long
i
strongly
recommend
picking
up
a
bottle
if
you
have
the
opportunity
my
hope
came
true
and
has
been
improved
upon
odthis
must
be
a
rebrew
of
their
2nd
anni
brew
therefore
until
i
am
proven
wrong
i
will
give
mass
rising
the
same
grade
what
a
beer
year
round
hell
yes
o
overall
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
to
come
out
of
jacks
abby
while
not
as
good
as
that
first
go
around
of
kiwi
rising
this
is
very
close
very
well
crafted
and
at
4
99
a
500ml
it
does
not
break
the
bank
the
taste
begins
with
a
biscuit
maltiness
and
then
becomes
rich
with
floral
and
pine
hops
citrus
but
more
specifically
grapefruit
and
tangerine
and
a
long
lasting
bitter
finale
an
amazing
beer
and
im
glad
i
got
to
celebrate
jacks
abbys
second
anniversary
with
this
one
pours
a
dull
light
orange
hue
with
a
hazy
clarity
and
a
voluminous
fluffy
threeinch
buttermilk
colored
head
as
the
head
slowly
settles
into
a
halfinch
cap
spots
and
strands
of
textured
lacing
are
revealed
nose
expresses
bittersweet
citrus
notes
perhaps
tangerine
and
grapefruit
followed
by
an
earthyherbal
rind
quality
taste
consistent
with
nose
a
perfect
balance
between
sweet
and
bitter
and
a
great
interplay
between
the
two
characters
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
with
a
touch
of
oiliness
to
the
texture
and
an
even
carbonation
that
leaves
just
the
faintest
hint
of
a
burn
at
the
back
of
the
throat
between
quaffs
overall
a
fantastic
anniversary
beer
i
am
consistently
blown
away
by
what
they
guys
do
with
lagers
nnot
quite
while
humulus
retains
just
enough
crispness
to
clearly
differentiate
itself
from
a
double
ipa
the
back
end
of
jas
second
anniversary
strays
into
the
harsh
medicinal
nodes
that
mar
most
iterations
of
this
difficult
style
thankfully
the
front
end
is
still
smooth
and
pleasant
and
the
backend
never
gets
painfully
sharp
but
it
comes
too
close
for
my
liking
after
having
this
a
few
times
out
of
the
bottle
and
once
on
draft
it
just
reinforces
something
i
already
knew
jacks
abby
knows
how
to
use
their
hops
the
clean
feel
of
the
base
beer
just
accentuates
the
great
blend
of
hops
they
choose
drinks
like
a
super
fresh
west
coast
ipa
loving
this
brewery
more
and
more
with
each
day
err
sip
o
very
good
hoppy
lager
i
am
impressed
with
the
giant
amount
of
hops
in
this
beer
and
the
clean
crisp
bitter
finish
well
done
o
a
ballsy
take
on
the
style
as
we
have
come
to
expect
from
jsa
bold
hop
profile
pushes
the
edge
of
a
hoppy
pils
only
knock
is
the
malt
base
seems
to
be
rather
bland
and
hindered
the
balancedrinkability
overall
a
very
solid
showing
but
not
my
fav
imperial
pils
id
like
to
think
of
it
as
a
west
coast
imperial
pilsner
o
great
lager
to
be
honest
if
it
was
placed
in
front
of
me
as
a
mystery
beer
i
would
absolutely
guess
ale
that
being
said
i
dont
want
to
take
anything
away
from
this
one
i
really
enjoy
the
hop
presence
throughout
as
well
as
the
drinkability
8
seriously
would
absolutely
recommendpick
up
again
fingers
crossed
d
a
nice
brew
to
be
certain
but
i
was
slightly
disappointed
considering
the
pedigree
the
hop
character
was
a
bit
muddled
rather
than
complex
and
i
was
also
hoping
for
more
hop
kick
and
a
bit
less
malt
wellexecuted
and
quite
tasty
as
all
jacks
abby
brews
tend
to
be
but
id
still
prefer
kiwi
rising
or
hoponius
union
absolutely
recommend
trying
this
if
you
can
find
it
ive
enjoyed
the
three
jacks
abby
lagers
ive
had
up
to
this
point
in
my
beer
drinking
career
although
ive
gotta
say
that
many
of
them
could
probably
pass
for
ales
theyve
all
got
a
nice
crisp
clean
finish
but
ive
seen
similar
palatable
qualities
achieved
with
ale
yeast
or
at
least
close
enough
to
not
require
extended
and
cooler
fermentation
in
any
case
another
good
brew
though
i
prefer
the
less
aggressive
more
drinkable
hoponius
union
o
this
is
a
phenomenal
beer
its
just
like
a
great
dipa
except
maybe
even
better
the
crisp
lager
mouthfeel
gives
it
a
much
more
drinkable
character
while
still
having
enough
body
for
the
magnitude
of
the
beer
this
is
really
a
marvelously
crafted
brew
thank
you
so
so
much
for
giving
me
the
opportunity
to
try
this
one
jared
cheers
delicious
cant
beat
the
drinkability
of
a
hoppy
lager
yes
more
of
this
please
super
hopped
up
double
pilsners
seem
to
be
coming
around
and
i
couldnt
be
happier
to
see
a
young
brewery
like
this
nail
it
this
reminded
me
of
humulus
lager
which
is
by
far
the
best
in
this
style
imo
total
4750
o
this
was
another
great
dipl
from
jacks
abby
that
is
easily
up
there
with
kiwi
rising
however
i
think
i
prefer
kiwi
slightly
more
with
the
more
intense
citrus
presence
the
2nd
anniversary
is
more
balanced
and
has
a
great
drinkability
despite
being
at
least
a
few
weeks
old
the
hops
in
this
beer
are
holding
up
great
i
hope
jacks
abby
continues
making
this
beer
and
i
definitely
recommend
checking
it
out
the
beer
pours
a
clear
golden
yellow
like
clean
yet
dehydrated
piss
the
beer
pours
with
a
beautiful
head
of
bubbles
that
sits
well
over
two
fingers
widths
above
the
beer
and
is
made
of
a
menagerie
of
different
sized
creamy
bubbles
when
the
head
leaves
the
beer
leaves
a
lacing
of
long
strings
of
medium
width
tiny
bubbles
alongside
the
glass
in
body
the
beer
is
beautifully
clean
and
pure
with
just
a
slight
haze
coming
from
the
malt
this
is
a
pretty
looking
beer
on
the
nose
this
beer
is
a
damp
head
rush
of
everything
i
love
about
american
hops
big
and
bristling
pine
moves
into
smooth
and
juicy
mango
and
pineapple
notes
with
light
hints
of
grapefruit
and
a
touch
of
tangerines
there
is
also
a
slight
dank
smell
lurking
below
all
the
other
smells
and
a
touch
of
caramelly
malt
though
i
havent
had
heady
topper
for
about
a
half
a
year
this
beer
smells
quite
similar
to
heady
to
me
as
it
sits
in
my
glass
the
dankness
grows
and
bristles
onto
the
nose
but
there
is
some
beautifully
juicy
fruit
notes
right
beside
it
this
beer
smells
great
on
the
tongue
this
beer
is
fearlessly
bitter
with
just
a
touch
of
sweet
on
the
finish
to
remind
us
that
there
is
in
fact
malt
in
this
beer
slight
touches
of
salt
and
acidity
can
also
be
sensed
on
the
fringes
of
the
tongue
but
really
this
beer
is
all
about
the
beautiful
bitters
in
flavor
the
beer
begins
as
a
blend
of
pine
and
tropical
fruit
juice
and
the
bitters
gracefully
build
from
there
trouncing
over
my
mouth
in
perfect
formation
light
biscuit
cracker
coincides
with
a
deep
dank
flavor
in
the
middle
of
the
palate
though
neither
works
its
way
in
front
of
the
fruity
bitters
which
continue
to
work
through
the
fruity
flavor
profile
of
hops
finishing
with
a
big
bitter
grapefruit
shiver
that
lingers
into
dank
pine
notes
in
the
aftertaste
in
the
mouth
the
beer
is
on
the
light
side
of
medium
with
near
perfect
carbonation
working
to
caress
the
tongue
like
a
soft
pillow
even
as
the
beers
bitters
bludgeon
it
the
mouth
is
left
terrifically
dry
and
slightly
sticky
and
though
the
tongue
wets
slightly
the
mouth
is
just
left
begging
for
another
sip
this
beer
is
a
masterpiece
of
hops
and
i
am
loving
it
a
richly
complex
smell
and
flavor
that
work
to
be
both
thirst
quenching
and
inspiring
this
is
an
awesome
beer
to
slug
during
the
summer
but
be
careful
as
its
8
alcohol
never
quite
shows
in
the
flavor
try
this
beer
for
sure
and
jacks
abby
please
make
this
a
regular
o
you
can
really
enjoy
this
one
another
good
effort
from
jacks
anyone
that
enjoys
a
tasty
hop
bomb
should
seek
this
out
impressive
brew
o
drinks
like
the
smoothest
ipa
possible
this
is
the
definitive
iipl
if
theres
even
any
competition
which
maybe
there
is
literally
but
certainly
is
not
in
any
other
sense
congrats
ja
on
2
years
this
beer
is
a
fantastic
big
brother
to
the
hoponious
union
a
much
cleaner
version
of
a
dipl
than
kiwi
rising
and
honestly
im
not
sure
which
i
like
better
whatever
try
this
beer
if
youre
a
hop
head
you
will
not
be
disappointed
overall
execellent
brew
jacks
abbys
2nd
anniversary
beer
is
a
seriously
hopped
up
lager
fitting
for
them
seeing
as
that
is
what
they
do
best
and
what
basically
put
them
on
the
map
they
take
it
to
an
extreme
here
completely
unbalanced
hop
bomb
but
a
great
beer
i
think
i
prefered
this
to
kiwi
rising
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
shaker
pint
the
beer
is
a
bright
slightly
hazed
goldenrod
coloring
with
slow
steady
carbonation
flow
and
a
tall
frothy
light
white
head
that
slowly
unevenly
settles
leaving
a
wicked
cling
along
the
glass
aromas
of
pine
resin
subtle
tropical
fruit
sweetness
pepper
spicing
and
a
rich
bitterness
subtle
toasted
grain
backbone
in
the
nose
also
flavors
are
very
hop
forward
with
a
resiny
bitter
blast
subtle
grassy
notes
with
tangy
and
tart
tropical
fruit
highlights
toasted
grain
undertones
very
smooth
light
bodied
with
a
hoppy
resiny
bitterness
into
the
aftertaste
clean
smooth
finish
that
has
a
slight
drying
effect
solid
brew
o
a
pretty
excellent
beer
delighted
that
its
made
a
return
in
yearround
form
in
mass
rising
even
if
i
do
think
the
latter
is
actually
a
more
balanced
and
allround
better
beer
i
have
to
give
credit
where
credits
due
to
the
oneoff
that
spawned
one
of
my
current
yearround
favorites
cheers
o
a
total
hop
bomb
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
another
home
run
by
the
crew
in
framingham
its
light
gold
with
a
solid
sheet
of
whites
and
near
brilliant
clarity
smells
absurdly
dank
marijuana
pine
weed
dankness
the
dankness
my
high
school
years
etc
flavor
is
a
little
less
hoppy
but
dank
nonetheless
lots
of
resiny
hops
some
nice
pilsner
malts
and
a
bit
of
bitterness
but
really
really
hoppy
flavor
for
the
style
medium
on
light
with
hi
carb
and
a
wet
finish
this
beer
is
seriously
tasty
but
appears
not
to
give
a
fuck
about
a
poorly
defined
styles
guidelines
cheers
to
jacks
abbey
overall
a
very
nice
beer
very
glad
to
try
it
and
wish
i
could
easily
get
more
and
try
it
on
tap
as
well
cheers
o
this
has
got
to
be
very
high
up
on
the
priority
list
for
all
the
hopheads
out
there
its
got
all
the
bitterness
you
could
want
and
then
some
a
very
wellexecuted
hop
bomb
2nd
anniversary
is
more
than
just
a
beer
with
hops
piled
in
clean
crisp
and
focused
this
took
some
skill
bravo
and
congratulations
to
jacks
abby
overall
100
ibus
and
showing
it
this
will
not
disappoint
those
who
love
hop
bombs
much
like
the
rest
of
jacks
abbeys
brews
it
is
very
clean
nice
beer
but
one
is
good
enough
for
me
pours
a
crystal
clear
deep
straw
with
a
huge
bubbly
bone
white
head
that
takes
forever
to
recede
aromas
of
spicy
onion
and
garlic
with
a
bit
of
pine
and
dankness
hiding
a
hint
of
bready
sweet
malt
the
flavor
is
lightly
bready
but
overpowered
by
resin
pine
and
green
onion
smooth
hop
flavor
with
just
a
touch
of
bitterness
medium
body
with
a
spirited
level
of
carbonation
and
a
slick
resinous
mouthfeel
nice
beer
im
glad
i
found
some
of
this
mouthfeel
is
really
awesome
also
medium
body
well
carbonated
a
good
dose
of
resin
but
not
too
sticky
only
reason
i
didnt
give
a
five
on
mouthfeel
was
because
its
perhaps
a
tad
bit
too
sticky
for
my
taste
but
its
really
an
exceptional
brew
go
get
it
o
jacks
abby
surprises
me
with
every
new
beer
i
try
from
them
loving
this
a
lot
more
than
the
abcs
double
ipl
and
the
kiwi
rising
i
had
was
old
this
beer
is
fresh
and
phenominal
the
hops
really
shine
through
the
lager
body
of
their
beers
and
i
m
loving
em
more
and
more
this
should
become
a
year
round
beer
fantastic
aroma
taste
great
body
and
dangerously
drinkable
i
already
know
i
want
another
and
im
only
a
third
of
the
way
in
gotta
find
more
of
these
a
very
pale
golden
color
thats
clear
with
lots
of
little
bubbles
racing
to
the
top
where
a
big
fluffy
white
head
sits
and
holds
decently
the
lacing
is
very
solid
the
aroma
brings
out
a
nice
citrus
with
a
spicy
bread
and
fruity
yeast
pleasant
hop
goodness
the
flavor
comes
out
with
a
more
prominent
citrusgrass
hop
bite
the
yeast
and
bread
ideas
remain
obvious
as
well
cereal
grain
with
a
very
bitter
grass
and
citrus
theme
that
camps
out
dryly
on
your
palate
this
brew
is
crisp
with
a
mediumlight
body
and
just
an
edge
of
some
creaminess
very
nice
great
beer
quite
dry
beyond
the
juicy
tropicals
and
super
smooth
call
it
what
you
will
but
this
beer
is
a
iipa
o
very
very
good
dip
w
the
classic
jacks
abby
l
touch
glad
i
got
2
while
i
was
in
town
and
if
my
cart
wasnt
full
w
other
ma
offerings
2013
on
tap
at
sugar
maple
in
milwaukee
its
dark
in
here
but
this
beer
appears
to
be
a
nice
amber
color
very
sweet
aroma
lots
and
lots
of
malt
good
hop
bite
but
mostly
sweet
tasting
from
the
grains
interesting
and
good
o
solid
tasty
and
a
nice
one
to
split
with
friends
price
isnt
right
but
if
you
like
your
big
pilsners
with
a
lot
of
hops
this
is
one
you
should
consider
buying
o
very
nice
imperial
pils
that
is
not
to
be
confused
with
an
ipl
those
looking
for
hops
should
look
at
other
offerings
this
one
will
satisfy
the
malt
lovers
overall
a
great
example
of
the
imperial
pilsner
and
would
drink
again
very
light
mouth
feel
i
would
say
the
lightest
for
a
7
abv
beer
that
i
can
ever
remember
having
super
refreshing
beer
that
would
be
awesome
on
a
hot
day
overall
if
this
was
in
cans
id
drink
this
mowing
the
grass
this
is
a
perfect
outside
mindless
beer
it
has
lots
of
taste
and
can
be
complex
if
you
concentrate
on
the
flavors
it
can
also
be
as
simple
as
a
busch
light
with
tons
more
flavor
thirst
quenching
and
satisfying
floyds
should
put
this
in
cans
or
six
pack
of
bottles
i
could
drink
this
all
night
but
at
7
2abv
id
be
shit
faced
in
no
time
o
i
dont
tend
to
like
pils
but
this
one
was
enjoyable
o
a
fairly
straight
forward
pilsner
with
a
little
more
alcohol
and
a
bit
less
skunky
that
usual
for
a
pilsner
good
beer
for
a
hot
dog
and
ball
game
though
not
what
i
usually
choose
for
a
type
of
beer
the
feel
is
appropriately
bright
and
crisp
in
a
lightmedium
body
its
semidry
without
getting
course
staying
clean
o
pilsners
are
typically
not
my
style
but
this
was
very
good
for
what
it
was
i
would
definitely
recommend
trying
it
and
especially
if
pilsners
are
up
your
alley
mouthfeel
is
good
high
carbonation
and
light
feel
is
balanced
out
with
some
hoppy
oils
and
bitterness
that
keeps
this
very
drinkable
but
not
to
thin
there
is
a
dry
finish
that
i
really
enjoy
also
thanks
to
xthul
for
this
awesome
extra
pours
a
clear
golden
orange
with
a
huge
white
quickly
dissipating
head
ok
lacing
aroma
of
biscuity
malts
followed
by
grassy
hop
notes
doughy
malts
hit
the
tongue
first
followed
by
earthy
european
hops
finishes
clean
and
dry
with
some
lingering
hop
spiciness
medium
bodied
and
highly
carbonated
overall
a
good
interpretation
of
the
pilsner
style
on
steroids
three
floyds
evil
power
45
o
again
clean
no
flaws
which
i
guess
means
for
a
pilsner
its
well
made
but
being
billed
as
an
imperial
pilsner
particularly
from
fff
i
expected
more
flavor
o
it
has
the
taste
of
a
european
pils
on
but
beefed
up
it
has
plenty
of
flavor
but
not
the
flavors
that
i
find
pleasing
if
you
are
into
this
style
you
will
probably
like
it
othe
balance
is
thrown
off
not
sure
what
the
flavor
is
but
it
hurts
the
beer
i
really
love
this
style
compared
to
what
regular
pils
beers
are
like
they
blow
them
outta
the
water
this
along
with
new
glarus
and
the
sierra
nevada
beer
camp
imperial
pils
are
my
top
3
this
one
probably
being
at
1
o
a
bit
hoppy
for
a
pilsner
and
definitely
thicker
i
like
the
effort
to
make
this
imperial
but
a
thicker
bigger
pilsner
doesnt
necessarily
work
as
well
as
it
does
for
ipas
if
it
had
this
flavor
without
being
so
thick
i
think
id
like
this
a
lot
more
lemon
and
shortbread
flavors
smooth
and
full
bodied
though
crisp
and
drinkable
lightly
bitter
hops
seem
almost
balanced
in
the
mix
this
is
great
wish
it
was
in
six
packs
instead
of
overpriced
bombers
m
light
leading
to
medium
there
is
a
little
body
there
little
thicker
than
regular
pils
o
this
is
a
style
i
usually
enjoy
and
the
flavor
set
here
is
a
nice
one
something
of
a
nice
malt
liquor
quality
good
start
to
finish
drinkable
a
quick
buzz
is
a
nice
way
to
set
the
tone
for
a
night
in
the
dunes
d
ive
come
to
appreciate
lagers
more
since
i
first
had
this
beer
and
my
upgrade
in
score
reflects
that
palate
shift
im
not
sure
the
beer
has
really
changed
since
i
first
had
this
in
2011
although
some
of
those
reviews
mention
excessive
sweetness
which
certainly
wasnt
the
case
here
i
prefer
lowerabv
pilsners
like
pony
but
i
sill
had
no
problem
splitting
a
bomber
with
smyra
o
not
sure
what
to
expect
at
this
point
and
with
the
beer
aged
as
long
as
it
was
but
i
was
quite
happy
with
the
results
kind
of
like
a
baby
barleywine
of
sorts
would
have
loved
to
have
tried
it
fresh
o
it
is
not
my
favorite
style
but
i
warmed
up
to
this
a
bit
as
i
got
through
the
glass
my
palate
adjusted
some
and
i
was
able
to
find
some
citrus
and
grain
nuance
that
was
covered
up
by
the
bitterness
at
first
it
is
a
tough
style
it
seems
and
this
is
a
noble
attempt
definitely
worth
a
shotbut
it
is
an
imperial
pilsner
this
one
held
up
pretty
well
maybe
some
of
the
pop
had
diminished
but
i
was
really
digging
the
unexpected
fruit
character
that
emerged
here
as
this
warmed
and
the
overall
smoothness
of
this
shocked
me
a
bit
as
well
solid
stuff
as
usual
from
fff
o
very
unique
beer
unfortunately
it
falls
a
little
flat
you
take
a
pilsner
which
is
generally
very
light
and
drinkable
and
then
make
it
fairly
heavy
and
malty
its
not
offensive
in
any
way
and
honestly
i
kinda
liked
the
way
it
smelled
and
tasted
it
just
overall
doesnt
work
for
me
admirable
effort
though
in
making
a
unique
beer
o
i
enjoyed
this
one
nice
flavor
profile
not
too
sweet
a
touch
more
hop
bitterness
would
be
nice
o
not
a
bad
beer
nice
lacing
but
probably
wont
seek
this
one
out
again
oaverage
beer
nothing
too
special
or
that
i
would
have
again
o
not
that
special
for
what
it
is
definitely
disappointing
for
three
floyds
o
i
guess
maybe
i
had
a
higher
expectations
for
this
one
i
found
this
one
pretty
boring
overall
this
was
on
the
maltier
side
for
the
style
but
i
thought
it
was
still
well
done
not
necessarily
one
id
itch
to
revisit
but
its
worth
a
shot
i
like
this
had
it
at
dark
lord
day
and
was
dissapointed
now
it
seems
to
have
mellowed
out
in
the
mouth
and
much
more
caramel
and
toffee
sweetness
is
coming
though
in
the
middle
and
finish
crackery
in
the
middle
finishing
with
the
classic
noble
hop
flavors
a
bit
spicey
a
floral
and
earthy
mouth
is
creamy
and
decadent
and
alcohol
only
shows
slightly
in
the
chest
o
imperial
pilsners
can
often
been
too
sweet
but
this
had
a
nice
balance
to
it
572011
o
kind
of
disappointed
in
this
beer
i
like
lair
of
the
minotaur
and
this
beer
doesnt
really
come
close
to
what
their
music
is
like
if
thats
what
they
are
going
for
needed
more
hop
character
to
make
the
beer
more
pronounced
and
less
of
a
light
malt
pilsner
cool
beer
that
was
fun
to
drink
im
glad
i
picked
up
two
bottles
of
this
dld
11
yknow
i
kinda
regretted
not
picking
up
a
bottle
of
this
at
dld
so
im
glad
to
have
a
chance
to
try
some
now
it
pours
a
clear
golden
straw
topped
by
a
finger
of
light
creamwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
grass
light
flowers
and
stone
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
amping
up
both
the
flowers
and
the
stone
and
adding
a
hint
of
orange
rind
and
some
very
light
pineapple
in
the
back
the
body
is
a
heftyish
light
with
a
moderate
carbonation
and
a
pretty
damn
crisp
finish
overall
a
nice
pils
though
kinda
weak
especially
for
its
classification
and
strength
still
i
could
easily
see
downing
a
few
pints
o
this
if
given
the
chance
o
this
beer
is
a
nice
clean
lager
with
some
good
hops
that
are
juicy
but
dry
and
a
soft
bitterness
there
is
a
faint
woody
note
in
the
bitterness
as
the
beer
opens
up
that
adds
some
nice
depth
o
interesting
beer
a
little
hoppier
than
i
expected
but
still
very
good
i
would
really
like
to
try
this
one
again
overall
this
is
an
interesting
beer
that
i
am
grateful
to
have
the
opportunity
to
drink
although
the
style
isnt
one
i
would
consider
overly
appealing
and
the
alcohol
taste
in
this
one
keeps
it
from
being
very
drinkable
o
not
real
great
but
most
imperial
pilsners
are
not
pass
overall
not
a
bad
beer
a
bit
heavy
on
the
alcohol
the
bitterness
hits
pretty
hard
in
the
finish
a
solid
offering
o
overall
a
nice
pilsner
poured
a
clear
golden
yellow
with
a
thin
white
head
the
sticks
to
the
glass
very
well
sweet
grain
slight
spicy
and
hop
aroma
tastes
of
spicy
yeast
profile
along
with
herbal
hops
and
bready
grain
slight
sulfur
kinda
thick
on
the
tounge
with
a
nice
creamyness
overall
a
good
beer
well
put
together
o
overall
just
a
pretty
average
pilsner
not
sure
if
i
just
dont
really
appreciate
the
style
or
what
but
it
just
seemed
a
bit
bland
to
me
not
a
beer
id
seek
out
again
and
a
rare
miss
for
fff
probably
my
least
favorite
beer
ive
had
from
them
so
far
o
an
aboveaverage
representation
of
a
belowaverage
style
goes
down
the
hatch
easily
and
is
reasonably
interesting
on
its
way
down
was
this
beer
brewed
for
the
metal
crowd
i
e
drinkers
of
mickeys
and
steel
reserve
i
know
not
all
of
them
but
many
of
them
anyways
not
bad
and
if
it
wasnt
for
the
price
i
bet
you
could
all
the
metalheads
to
drink
this
brew
overall
its
possible
that
the
hops
have
faded
in
the
month
since
i
got
this
beer
because
thats
what
it
tastes
like
too
bad
i
cant
get
a
fresh
one
o
this
is
an
unimpressive
beer
for
fff
imperial
pilsners
can
be
so
much
more
hops
and
malts
can
take
on
beautiful
and
compex
nuances
too
bad
they
were
unable
to
make
this
happen
a
participant
brought
a
fresh
growler
of
evil
power
from
three
floydsthe
color
is
golden
with
thin
white
head
i
do
not
smell
much
maybe
a
slight
hint
of
hopgrain
taste
is
common
to
a
golden
aleslightly
hop
slight
citrus
i
taste
hints
of
clove
and
bananna
as
well
not
sure
whats
going
on
mouthfeel
is
decent
certainly
can
suck
it
down
did
not
really
enjoy
this
one
o
better
than
other
pilsners
but
still
just
sort
of
an
average
beer
nothing
popped
or
stood
out
for
me
on
this
one
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
not
worth
10
a
bomber
at
all
and
not
a
particularly
good
example
of
the
style
solid
but
not
a
must
have
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
it
boasts
a
slick
creamy
feel
instead
of
the
typical
pils
crispness
i
appreciate
the
attempt
but
just
couldnt
get
into
this
brew
no
matter
how
much
i
wanted
to
imperial
pils
is
a
hard
style
to
pull
off
and
i
think
this
example
missed
the
mark
at
10
a
bomber
i
would
not
buy
this
again
i
was
thankful
to
have
2
other
people
help
me
finish
the
bottle
overall
i
was
really
hoping
for
this
to
be
a
hoppy
strong
lager
a
la
southern
tier
krampus
but
to
no
avail
even
as
a
fortified
pils
this
is
not
a
very
strong
effort
this
beer
shows
once
again
that
lagers
are
the
achilles
heel
of
fff
lair
of
the
minatour
should
stick
to
heavy
metal
and
fff
should
go
back
to
making
better
beer
glad
this
was
only
a
5
oz
pour
i
had
enough
o
worth
10
a
bomber
probably
not
cool
label
though
o
this
is
sort
of
a
weaker
beer
from
three
floyds
though
its
definitely
not
average
i
truely
love
3f
but
im
not
sure
what
they
were
going
for
in
this
beer
it
seems
confused
in
terms
of
flavor
and
style
overall
a
nice
imperial
pils
i
really
enjoy
this
style
but
seemed
to
like
the
cleaner
tasting
uinta
beer
twisted
smile
o
overall
enjoyed
this
beer
and
it
is
very
drinkable
i
just
dont
see
me
seeking
this
one
out
that
much
it
is
a
nice
beer
to
have
when
enjoying
a
nice
hot
summer
day
though
o
for
the
abv
this
drinks
pretty
well
i
feel
that
this
beer
is
about
on
par
for
the
style
im
not
much
of
a
pilsner
guy
but
this
is
impressive
good
flavor
very
refreshing
and
not
to
mention
its
from
my
favorite
brewery
im
sure
my
non
beer
geek
friends
would
find
this
brew
enjoyable
but
i
doubt
this
will
be
around
much
longer
would
i
buy
this
again
doubtful
as
im
an
ale
man
but
if
someone
bought
a
round
of
this
id
drink
it
with
a
smile
on
my
face
it
tastes
very
sweet
overly
sweet
in
my
opinion
with
a
strangely
thick
body
that
was
unexpected
i
think
this
is
one
of
those
rare
times
that
three
floyds
made
a
turd
this
maltheavy
creation
is
too
thick
and
sweet
to
be
very
drinkable
evident
alcohol
too
no
more
please
overall
this
isnt
a
beer
that
lives
up
to
fff
standards
most
other
breweries
would
get
rave
reviews
for
a
7
2
pils
but
here
the
flavors
dont
pop
and
it
isnt
even
especially
wellbalanced
only
just
a
slight
hint
of
bitterness
to
counteract
the
massive
malt
bill
thanks
to
funkyaudio
for
the
beer
poured
from
bomber
into
a
tulip
glass
pours
a
deep
dark
golden
pour
with
a
healthy

there
was
some
bite
which
ultimately
leads
to
the
overall
taste
that
went
flat
all
of
a
sudden
a
major
disappointment
for
such
a
big
hyped
beer
coming
out
of
dark
lord
day
not
one
of
my
top
3f
beer
here
o
i
enjoyed
this
beer
alcohol
definitely
sneaks
up
you
thought
the
beer
improved
as
it
warmed
up
and
if
there
was
a
label
rating
this
one
would
get
a
5
0
glad
i
had
a
chance
to
try
this
evil
power
pours
out
with
a
nice
golden
color
with
solid
white
head
and
good
lacing
bread
yeast
and
fruits
on
the
nose
it
smells
appealing
it
tastes
like
light
hops
and
malts
not
overly
grassy
for
a
pilnser
thankfully
creamy
mouthfeel
and
very
good
drinkability
this
brew
is
relatively
nice
on
all
levels
i
would
probably
drinkin
it
again
o
this
beer
was
good
and
a
little
interesting
because
it
is
not
really
a
3
floyds
beer
per
say
the
alcohol
really
showed
as
this
beer
warmed
more
and
more
flavor
wise
i
thought
it
was
good
and
blended
well
as
a
one
off
i
wish
it
had
a
little
more
aging
potential
o
smooth
pils
easy
to
drink
more
than
one
i
can
see
where
some
would
want
more
of
a
hop
presence
but
theres
plenty
of
that
out
there
already
im
not
going
to
be
up
nights
worrying
about
being
out
of
this
brew
but
id
pick
up
another
one
or
two
if
i
came
across
some
o
a
fantastic
beer
with
a
small
cast
of
flavors
that
hold
hands
and
get
along
great
together
kudos
to
fff
for
another
delicious
beer
overall
it
is
a
decent
beer
no
real
hints
of
the
alcohol
but
id
be
surprised
if
there
were
at
less
than
8
i
personally
would
not
buy
again
it
really
isnt
that
easy
to
drink
nor
enjoyable
as
a
sipper
o
drinkable
though
cant
say
i
cared
for
it
much
sweet
and
alcoholic
with
not
much
in
the
way
of
hops
or
malt
to
round
it
out
this
was
good
but
not
what
i
was
expecting
most
imperial
pilsners
are
heavy
on
the
hops
however
this
was
heavy
on
the
malts
probably
the
most
true
imperial
pilsner
i
have
had
however
i
prefer
them
with
more
hops
to
balance
out
the
heavy
malt
pour
yields
a
mostlyclear
goldencolored
brew
with
a
thin
for
the
style
white
head
and
not
much
lacing
some
spots
as
it
goes
down
after
a
few
swirls
the
nose
carries
a
bit
of
light
grain
and
a
very
slight
touch
of
floral
hops
a
bit
bready
the
flavor
is
all
too
bready
without
a
real
ho
component
to
back
it
up
it
seems
like
its
a
bit
stale
which
i
would
expect
to
be
the
case
had
i
not
just
picked
it
up
at
the
brewery
body
is
far
too
thick
with
a
strong
bready
component
hops
are
tertiary
im
not
sure
whats
secondary
adequate
carbonation
but
i
cant
get
past
the
excessive
body
and
lack
of
bitterness
or
anything
resembling
crispness
not
a
fan
not
a
fan
at
all
overall
enjoyed
this
beer
but
i
do
not
see
this
beer
being
in
the
rotation
mine
or
theirs
only
bad
thing
is
evil
power
name
is
deceiving
for
this
beer
after
hearing
the
band
lair
of
minotaur
and
reading
that
this
was
tribute
to
them
i
expected
a
beer
that
would
hit
you
over
the
head
with
its
ibu
but
was
pleasantly
surprised
i
picked
up
two
bottles
of
this
at
dld
right
after
grabbing
my
four
bottles
of
dld
i
ended
up
opening
both
of
them
within
the
hour
and
sharing
them
with
random
bas
it
poured
a
thinner
golden
yellow
in
color
with
a
sticky
bright
white
head
that
laced
my
snifter
it
smelled
of
sweet
pale
malts
bitter
hops
honey
and
lemons
i
thought
it
was
interesting
it
tasted
of
sweet
pale
malts
light
honey
and
had
a
bitter
lemony
finish
it
was
well
carbonated
and
drank
well
for
the
style
it
was
good
but
i
wouldnt
say
that
it
was
my
antonia
good
i
meant
to
hold
on
to
one
of
these
for
others
to
try
but
ended
up
opening
my
second
bottle
only
to
talk
football
with
a
random
ba
for
a
half
hour
oh
well
guess
ill
have
to
go
back
to
fff
had
to
give
this
almost
4s
across
the
board
because
i
enjoyed
it
for
a
style
im
not
especially
fond
of
not
hopped
to
hell
not
crazy
sweet
not
boring
in
the
end
wouldnt
seek
it
out
unless
i
was
a
big
pils
fan
jinxproof
made
a
return
but
even
if
this
did
i
think
1
was
enough
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
however
not
sure
i
would
want
to
spend
10
for
another
bomber
of
this
i
think
this
is
a
great
example
of
this
style
but
imo
would
rather
see
this
bottled
in
a
6er
on
the
sweeter
side
and
i
loved
the
buzz
i
like
it
because
it
is
basically
a
balanced
beer
flavor
plus
it
has
the
coolest
label
ive
ever
seen
i
may
find
better
in
the
future
but
for
today
this
is
one
of
the
two
beers
that
got
me
started
paying
attention
so
for
now
i
have
a
loyalty
to
pilsener
bohemian
style
and
a
couple
of
breweries
not
a
welldone
beer
not
sure
who
this
is
supposed
to
appeal
to
pilsners
are
one
of
my
favorite
styles
but
this
is
not
a
pilsner
ummm
amazing
i
really
really
like
it
however
i
will
say
that
i
dont
know
that
its
leaps
and
bounds
ahead
of
a
good
standard
pilsner
and
in
the
realm
of
doubles
i
think
i
liked
uintas
crooked
smile
a
bit
better
excellent
take
on
the
style
though
and
i
would
totally
get
it
again
its
in
my
4pack
club
now
if
i
forget
this
is
suppose
to
be
any
kind
of
lager
it
is
just
a
middle
of
the
road
dipa
i
am
not
sure
what
a
double
pilsner
is
suppose
to
be
but
this
is
not
what
i
have
in
mind
fails
miserably
on
style
points
really
just
an
average
dipa
that
happens
to
be
made
with
a
lager
yeast
that
seems
to
be
fermented
at
warmer
than
normal
temperature
o
perfect
take
on
a
double
pilsner
sweet
malty
easy
to
drink
poured
like
a
dense
amber
cloud
very
lite
head
one
finger
lacing
a
few
bubbles
very
little
percolation
mouth
feel
bohemian
pilsner
for
sure
taste
refreshingly
bold
at
8
1
acl
exceptionally
smooth
as
the
owl
on
the
label
stares
into
eyes
for
pilsner
drinkers
a
wise
choice
cheers
even
without
the
offflavor
this
beer
wasnt
much
to
be
impressed
with
dont
think
ill
have
another
poured
a
beautiful
golden
yellow
with
two
fingers
of
pure
white
head
it
looks
like
what
a
quintessential
lagerpilsner
beer
should
look
like
like
every
picture
in
media
one
has
ever
seen
excellent
scents
of
pilsner
malt
sweetness
bohemian
hops
and
some
very
slight
citrus
a
nose
very
similar
to
many
a
pilsner
but
with
a
unique
american
twist
i
like
it
flavors
of
grapefruit
grapefruit
pith
citrus
and
crystal
malt
sweetness
but
with
a
nice
bohemian
hop
character
present
as
well
it
balances
the
bitterness
with
the
sweetness
as
a
good
pilsner
should
and
is
quite
pleasant
in
its
taste
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
a
bit
heavier
than
a
normal
pilsner
but
fitting
an
american
imperial
pilsner
it
was
still
quite
easy
to
drink
and
was
not
unpleasant
overall
this
was
a
unique
yet
familiar
beer
it
had
the
hallmarks
of
the
classic
pilsner
but
with
the
twist
of
american
craft
i
greatly
enjoyed
it
and
would
go
back
to
it
again
o
paired
with
a
spicy
burger
at
the
foundry
in
westport
kc
simply
put
my
favorite
pils
ever
o
im
not
a
pilsner
fan
by
any
means
but
this
one
is
really
good
it
has
the
crisp
and
refreshing
characteristics
of
a
pilsner
but
isnt
watery
or
boring
it
could
use
a
bit
more
complexity
in
the
smell
and
taste
department
but
i
would
still
drink
this
again
there
is
something
off
about
this
beer
i
love
pilsners
and
i
seek
them
out
as
much
as
possible
i
also
really
dig
most
of
the
brews
from
odell
this
one
however
the
double
pils
is
a
disappointment
i
recently
had
very
fresh
on
tap
and
fresh
in
the
bottle
and
in
both
cases
the
alcohol
imparted
a
medicine
like
taste
and
smell
i
dont
enjoy
it
and
will
not
buy
this
one
again
it
promises
to
be
much
better
for
a
double
pils
from
odell
maybe
its
the
most
recent
batch
overall
ok
this
beer
is
not
horrible
but
it
really
does
not
float
my
boat
overall
probably
a
onetimer
for
me
the
style
intrigues
me
mostly
because
the
first
double
pils
i
ever
had
was
fantastic
and
unfortunately
a
onetime
release
and
ive
been
searching
for
an
equivalent
ever
sense
this
definitely
was
not
it
in
spite
of
the
pretty
snappy
looking
label
overall
i
wouldnt
consider
myself
at
all
knowledgeable
on
pilseners
but
i
found
this
to
be
an
enjoyable
if
somewhat
unexciting
beer
i
found
myself
wanting
a
bit
more
complexity
especially
for
something
that
was
8
abv
though
i
appreciated
the
hop
flavors
the
more
i
drank
it
very
drinkable
for
8
paired
pretty
well
with
chinese
takeout
seems
my
past
experiences
have
been
pretty
enjoyable
with
this
beer
maybe
this
batch
isnt
quite
up
to
par
freshness
date
on
bottle
is
91213a
this
is
my
second
bottle
from
this
fourpack
had
the
first
last
night
same
overall
impression
overall
i
was
pretty
letdown
by
the
appearance
but
there
was
nothing
bad
about
the
drinking
process
it
fit
its
style
pretty
well
from
what
ive
tried
and
did
not
even
notice
the
high
abv
odell
could
and
can
improve
on
this
one
but
so
far
so
good
i
could
drink
albright
exept
the
8
abv
final
thoughts
if
i
was
drinking
this
blind
id
probably
think
it
was
lager
version
of
odell
ipa
it
has
that
great
hop
flavor
and
juicyness
that
they
pack
most
of
their
brews
would
i
drink
it
again
yes
wish
theyd
make
a
sessionable
version
this
poured
out
as
a
slightly
hazy
looking
yellow
color
with
a
strong
white
head
on
top
the
head
retention
on
this
beer
is
very
impressive
since
its
a
high
abv
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
malty
there
are
some
hints
of
grass
in
there
as
well
some
hops
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
grainy
with
a
decent
sweetness
to
it
there
is
also
some
booze
heat
in
there
also
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
on
the
creamy
side
i
thought
the
body
was
medium
with
a
solid
amount
of
carbonation
overall
its
not
a
bad
brew
just
not
as
impressive
as
i
was
hoping
for
o
this
is
my
first
imperial
pilsener
but
this
stuff
is
incredible
the
abv
is
undetectable
and
the
flavour
profile
makes
this
brew
insanely
drinkable
i
will
definitely
be
searching
this
stuff
out
next
time
i
head
south
and
i
highly
recommend
this
brew
my
biggest
problem
with
this
beer
was
that
there
was
only
one
on
the
shelf
at
the
store
good
beer
all
around
i
had
never
heard
of
a
double
pilsner
before
this
beer
so
i
was
pretty
curious
hey
odell
makes
quality
stuff
so
it
was
a
safe
order
i
got
it
on
draft
and
the
look
was
classic
pilsner
clear
and
golden
like
most
pilsners
this
one
has
a
very
faint
slightly
cleaning
fluid
smell
the
taste
is
light
and
crisp
but
with
the
higher
than
average
alcohol
content
the
taste
also
had
a
slightly
bitter
bite
to
it
not
an
unpleasant
beer
just
guess
meh
cheers
o
overall
this
was
another
solid
brew
from
odells
its
a
full
flavor
beer
while
very
drinkable
at
the
same
time
although
it
lacked
the
wow
factor
that
some
of
their
other
beers
provide
i
would
buy
it
again
finish
is
clean
highly
drinkable
frames
all
the
right
elements
of
a
well
crafted
pilsner
delicious
on
tap
i
remember
this
as
being
better
from
the
12
oz
bottle
that
has
been
in
my
cool
basement
at
least
six
months
i
havent
had
a
good
double
pils
in
a
while
and
this
is
the
perfect
beer
to
draw
me
back
to
the
genius
of
this
oft
overlooked
style
low
c
i
wish
they
had
a
regular
pilsner
as
the
extra
heft
isnt
worth
it
would
drink
this
more
often
if
it
was
a
little
cheaper
screw
bmc
there
needs
to
be
more
big
pilsners
like
this
overall
a
pretty
good
amped
up
take
on
a
pilsner
very
full
and
bready
with
a
nice
spicy
hop
presence
in
the
back
end
underrated
this
imperial
pils
was
first
introduced
to
me
years
ago
and
i
remember
loving
it
and
i
still
do
it
has
a
great
fullness
in
the
pilsen
crisp
hop
yet
the
moxy
and
complexity
of
a
fullbodied
beer
odell
has
done
it
again
the
alcohol
isnt
noticable
but
the
richer
maltiness
than
most
pilsners
is
noticeable
in
a
good
way
that
adds
complexity
it
drinks
like
an
ale
about
a
half
an
inch
of
white
froth
that
laced
the
glass
quite
well
a
light
straw
color
slightly
cloudy
and
well
carbinated
not
much
of
an
aroma
and
a
very
light
taste
with
florals
and
some
alcohol
some
hops
come
out
on
the
back
end
i
thought
it
was
a
pretty
good
beer
for
the
style
not
may
favorite
style
but
a
decent
beer
pours
a
light
yellow
with
an
orange
hue
effervescent
with
bubbles
continually
rising
to
the
surface
a
half
thumbs
width
white
head
an
aroma
of
hay
cracker
and
a
hint
of
citrus
flavor
matches
the
aroma
quite
well
with
a
strong
malt
backbone
giving
it
a
nice
sweetness
and
cracker
taste
some
hay
and
grass
and
the
slightest
hint
of
lemon
the
alcohol
is
dangerously
hidden
on
this
one
a
silky
active
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
to
this
odell
with
another
fine
beer
that
hits
the
spot
as
i
sit
back
and
watch
some
rockies
baseball
i
dont
care
for
pilsners
but
they
got
me
to
enjoy
this
one
the
high
abv
to
this
makes
this
a
tease
as
this
beer
strikes
you
as
a
great
session
beer
but
at
8
it
will
get
you
into
trouble
really
quickly
pours
a
clear
light
golden
color
with
a
small
white
head
smells
like
sweeter
german
malts
and
floral
hops
very
delicate
for
an
double
very
unassuming
flavor
is
mild
too
malty
but
in
a
refreshing
way
not
a
filling
way
very
light
hops
in
the
finish
you
would
never
guess
this
was
over
8
abv
mouthfeel
is
nice
very
prominent
carbonation
makes
it
easy
drinking
and
the
just
medium
body
is
perfect
for
this
beer
potentially
a
nice
session
beer
despite
its
strength
odell
does
not
have
any
bad
beer
and
this
one
is
no
exception
very
well
made
a
good
spring
seasonal
but
not
the
most
exciting
brew
in
their
lineup
worth
a
try
for
sure
though
easy
to
drink

its
a

bestby
date
overall
a
decent
enough
double
pilsner
but
nothing
earth
shattering
worth
a
try
though
one
finger
pure
white
head
small
bubbles
medium
dissipation
with
decent
lacing
very
hoppy
nose
for
style
big
floral
notes
some
malty
sweetness
in
the
middle
taste
mirrors
nose
one
of
the
most
hoppy
pilseners
ive
had
quite
tasty
mouthfeel
is
medium
real
good
effervescence
fairly
dry
finish
though
the
abv
is
fairly
noticeable
another
winner
from
odell
definitely
worth
a
try
overall
a
tasty
double
pils
doesnt
smell
like
much
but
the
flavor
is
nice
and
it
isnt
harsh
at
all
after
having
and
loving
their
double
ipa
myrcenary
i
had
to
try
the
double
pilsner
but
swapped
half
of
the
4pack
out
for
more
myrcenary
glad
i
did
while
double
pilsner
is
a
fine
beer
it
doesnt
measure
up
to
the
double
ipa
my
biggest
problem
is
that
the
flavor
is
too
buttery
without
the
requisite
peppy
citrus
hop
punch
i
expected
besides
disguising
its
abv
of
8
1
remarkably
well
there
really
isnt
anything
special
about
this
beer
which
coupled
with
the
price
tag
of
2
50
a
bottle
is
enough
to
keep
me
from
picking
up
more
of
this
in
the
foreseeable
future
amber
with
a
nice
cap
of
white
hanging
over
the
top
of
the
glass
nice
rich
looking
head
of
foam
on
the
top
of
the
glass
here
now
as
well
nicely
done
i
have
to
say
aroma
immediately
is
a
bit
boozy
with
hints
of
grass
touches
of
hops
and
a
light
fruit
note
that
seems
to
pick
up
the
warmer
it
gets
interesting
flavor
profile
as
well
here
not
at
all
what
i
was
expecting
hints
of
citrus
a
touch
of
herbal
floral
notes
and
a
really
nice
and
well
laid
out
malty
background
overall
this
is
my
first
experience
with
a
double
pilsner
but
i
enjoyed
it
tastes
like
a
very
sessionable
beer
but
the
8
abv
suggests
otherwise
i
will
let
you
know
tomorrow
i
like
this
but
it
isnt
what
i
was
hoping
for
in
the
taste
department
still
a
nice
beer
by
a
great
brewery
overall
excellent
beer
this
may
be
the
best
double
pils
i
have
tried
well
balanced
midbodied
imperial
pilsner
with
nice
malty
tones
i
love
to
have
a
nice
refreshing
pilsner
every
now
and
then
but
this
one
really
takes
the
cake
this
has
been
the
first
beer
i
have
had
the
pleasure
to
enjoy
from
odell
and
overall
i
am
impressed
odell
double
pilsner
when
buying
a
four
pack
for
over
10
you
expect
something
special
the
odell
myrcenary
double
ipa
was
great
so
i
figured
i
should
try
their
double
pilsner
once
in
the
glass
you
will
see
a
clear
straw
colored
body
with
a
very
average
head
nothing
to
write
home
about
and
you
are
wondering
if
money
was
well
spent
but
the
aroma
is
fantastic
the
head
lasts
right
to
the
bottom
and
the
flavor
is
top
shelf
very
smooth
and
despite
appearances
this
is
not
a
light
beer
it
delivers
a
sophisticated
range
of
flavor
that
any
serious
beer
drinker
will
appreciate
overall
as
stated
im
just
now
breaking
into
imperial
pilsner
territory
im
no
authority
here
this
beer
falls
neatly
under
the
clean
category
neither
spice
nor
bitterness
seems
to
crop
up
from
malt
or
noble
hops
the
abv
is
hidden
but
behind
what
i
couldnt
say
my
last
foray
into
the
imperial
pils
was
fruitier
with
a
lot
of
yeast
character
this
one
seems
to
have
a
palette
all
its
own
ill
be
sure
to
edit
this
review
if
i
get
future
insight
mouthfeel
drinkability
is
crazy
for
a
8
percent
beer
heavy
carbonation
medium
to
heavy
body
for
the
style
o
i
was
surprised
by
this
beers
taste
profile
but
nothing
else
about
is
that
extraodinary
if
you
find
it
on
tap
then
give
it
a
try
but
i
wouldnt
seek
this
one
out
o
very
tasty
great
choice
for
fall
heavy
enough
to
satisfy
and
warm
you
up
without
being
overwhelming
d
very
nice
impy
pils
solid
and
worth
a
try
and
repeat
very
refreshing
very
drinkable
and
full
of
subtle
flavor
this
is
only
my
second
imperial
pilsner
boulevards
collaboration
no
1
being
the
first
i
like
it
quite
a
bit
initially
i
thought
maybe
it
was
a
tad
too
thick
and
sweet
and
could
use
a
bolder
hop
bite
but
really
its
a
nicely
balanced
big
beer
thats
easyand
enjoyableto
drink
not
sure
id
buy
a
fourpack
of
it
but
a
single
certainly
and
on
tap
somewhere
definitely
o
quite
refreshing
for
a
bigger
bodied
pilsner
alcohol
is
evident
here
and
there
but
it
hits
the
marks
of
what
a
pilsner
is
something
i
would
want
a
lot
of
and
a
good
summer
beer
another
reason
why
i
am
a
homer
on
this
brewery
they
rarely
make
duds
o
i
was
impressed
with
this
beer
usually
do
not
enjoy
the
pilsner
style
beers
very
tasty
and
balanced
easy
drinkability
as
well
overall
a
good
imperial
pilsner
from
a
brewery
that
i
am
loving
more
and
more
with
everything
i
come
across
from
them
having
enjoyed
this
one
immensely
in
the
past
if
memory
serves
i
was
still
leary
of
picking
up
the
new
104packs
previously
96packs
although
i
eventually
did
due
to
an
upcoming
trade
poured
a
crisp
golden
yellow
color
with
a
fluffy
white
head
aromas
of
slightly
floral
hops
biscuit
and
pepper
on
the
palate
this
one
was
light
to
medium
bodied
with
flavors
of
hops
biscuit
and
a
slight
pepperiness
overall
another
solid
beer
from
odell
o
overall
really
nice
imperial
pils
i
found
it
to
be
very
enjoyable
while
on
a
hot
summer
day
this
brew
is
refreshing
while
still
packing
the
warming
punch
of
a
winter
warmer
and
getting
the
abv
on
your
side
to
get
the
task
at
hand
completed
well
done
6252011
summer
is
putting
its
foot
in
the
door
here
in
colorado
sweating
and
heaving
with
awkward
heat
the
rest
of
us
emulate
summer
panting
and
clamoring
for
panaceas
to
the
heat
its
time
to
put
away
the
stouts
and
porters
for
good
and
find
some
lighter
brews
todays
cooling
agent
is
the
odell
double
pilsener
ive
been
slowly
consuming
my
fourpack
since
may
but
im
finding
its
just
as
much
a
spring
beer
as
it
is
a
summer
beer
this
dandelion
yellow
beer
takes
on
a
beautifully
chilled
haze
and
beckons
for
the
drinker
to
share
in
its
thermal
alms
before
i
indulge
desperately
and
greedily
with
beads
of
sweat
racing
across
my
face
i
take
in
the
aroma
a
fresh
and
balanced
pilsener
aroma
with
corn
and
fresh
cashews
and
not
too
dry
the
taste
is
refreshing
cooling
and
engaging
its
a
light
flavor
objectively
but
a
relatively
intense
pilsener
packed
with
flavor
odells
double
pilsener
doesnt
rely
on
alcohol
to
mask
clumsy
flavors
its
open
and
honest
packed
with
pilsener
goodness
and
perhaps
the
closest
ill
come
to
the
flavors
of
a
fresh
pilsener
urquell
roasted
corn
dandelion
petals
and
a
superbly
executed
bitterness
all
make
the
odell
double
pilsener
a
beer
worth
splurging
on
and
a
fine
brew
for
a
late
summer
afternoon
where
the
winds
are
as
lazy
as
us
the
awkward
guests
to
an
burdensomely
hot
summer
day
d
super
drinkable
really
nice
beer
from
these
guys
the
hopping
is
the
most
unique
part
of
this
and
im
still
deciding
if
it
works
im
conflicted
at
this
moment
o
very
interesting
brew
definite
winner
in
my
book
very
refreshing
had
to
keep
reminding
myself
that
this
wasnt
no
ordinary
pils
overall
very
light
and
subtle
and
well
balanced
interesting
and
spicy
and
slightly
floral
and
sweet
but
without
pushing
the
pilsner
envelope
past
the
limits
of
the
style
a
bit
too
drinkable
for
the
abv
almost
great
beer
worth
the
price
tag
every
now
and
then
o
overall
this
is
really
a
good
beer
imperial
pilsner
is
one
of
my
favorite
styles
and
odells
does
not
disappoint
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
that
is
not
flashy
with
big
bold
flavors
but
excels
in
the
simple
things
overall
very
interesting
beer
i
love
the
morphing
quality
of
the
taste
this
is
really
good
and
drinks
well
the
flavor
will
appeal
to
many
as
it
is
not
overbearing
yet
satisfies
a
really
nice
beer
for
the
style
clear
golden
body
thin
tight
white
head
awesome
aroma
perfect
pilsner
malt
aroma
bready
and
cracker
like
thats
all
i
need
right
there
but
theres
also
a
little
lemon
and
hay
perfect
av
for
the
style
i
dont
need
a
10
or
11
hot
bomb
when
i
have
a
double
pilsner
8
is
perfect
and
there
is
hardly
any
alcohol
noticeable
in
the
flavor
adds
a
little
dryness
to
the
mouthfeel
perhaps
but
nothing
else
body
is
medium
or
so
and
the
carbonation
is
medium
at
best
could
use
a
little
bit
more
co2
in
my
opinion
flavor
is
quite
nice
and
the
bready
biscuity
doughy
cracker
like
malt
base
is
the
showcase
hops
add
a
little
hay
and
lemon
very
smooth
and
very
drinkable
oreally
drinks
more
like
an
amped
up
helles
than
a
double
pilsner
lacks
the
spicy
hopiness
i
was
hoping
to
see
but
is
a
very
tasty
lager
with
some
heft
to
it
the
lemony
hops
are
fine
but
would
prefer
a
bit
more
spicy
hop
feel
od
deceivingly
drinkable
easy
on
the
palette
and
hidden
alcohol
although
no
one
would
ever
confuse
this
for
its
single
strength
brother
medium
bodied
very
smooth
but
sticky
sweet
residual
feeling
instead
of
a
crisp
dry
finish
i
can
only
think
of
one
or
two
other
pilsners
id
enjoy
this
much
another
job
well
done
here
the
head
drops
a
thick
crown
of
lace
clear
and
bright
yellow
color
spicy
herbal
hops
grassy
with
a
sweet
biscuit
and
clean
alcoholic
nose
creamy
medium
body
smoothness
runs
deep
maltiness
peels
back
another
flavor
after
each
sip
as
it
slowly
warms
up
biscuity
doughy
pasty
flour
bitterness
is
pretty
high
but
does
not
go
above
any
other
flavor
alcohol
is
very
warming
and
very
clean
taste
buds
have
their
work
cut
our
for
them
here
a
bit
too
drinkable
for
a
bigger
beer
but
im
not
complaining
overall
surprisingly
refreshing
for
such
a
high
abv
beer
that
said
a
standard
pils
would
be
more
refreshing
so
imperializing
a
style
that
is
meant
to
be
light
and
refreshing
is
slightly
odd
however
the
taste
is
great
so
maybe
that
is
the
whole
point
if
not
for
the
residual
sweetness
and
aftertaste
this
would
be
a
home
run
double
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
but
it
also
seems
that
the
malt
was
doubled
which
hurts
the
crispness
and
sweetens
the
beer
a
nice
flavorful
pilsner
but
one
that
i
will
take
much
colder
the
next
time
around
golden
color
in
the
glass
light
and
fizzy
nice
carbonation
quick
white
head
with
minimal
lacing
aromas
are
light
and
bready
decent
hop
presence
flavor
is
spot
on
american
pilsner
crisp
light
doughy
but
fuller
bodied
than
expected
very
drinkable
not
a
big
fan
of
the
pilsner
style
in
general
but
i
could
do
this
one
has
the
strength
and
body
that
i
look
for
in
other
styles
of
beer
im
really
not
into
pilsner
but
since
its
a
double
i
figured
one
12
oz
bottle
would
be
fine
and
i
was
right
its
crisp
clean
refreshing
and
worth
a
try
if
you
like
the
pilsner
then
you
must
get
it
i
can
only
imagine
this
beer
to
be
like
a
blonde
bock
that
has
been
over
hopped
i
love
a
blonde
bock
the
malty
sweetness
is
awesome
i
almost
feel
that
this
beer
would
have
been
a
great
bock
if
they
had
laid
off
the
hops
and
the
salty
finish
really
kills
it
for
me
comes
off
more
like
a
pale
bock
maibock
or
one
of
those
7
eastern
european
strong
lagers
rather
than
a
double
pilsner
i
would
like
the
hops
to
shine
through
more
even
be
on
the
aggressive
side
im
not
so
into
these
maltier
double
pilsners
when
i
think
of
pilsner
i
think
of
hoppy
lager
the
soapier
the
more
i
like
it
overall
a
very
enjoyable
pilsner
and
at
such
a
high
alcohol
content
this
one
could
be
dangerous
overall
another
well
done
beer
by
odell
with
a
few
minor
tweaks
this
could
be
a
world
class
beer
would
recommend
this
to
fans
of
the
classic
pilsner
styles
this
beer
pours
a
clear
spun
gold
color
the
head
is
one
and
a
half
inches
of
bright
white
foam
that
recedes
slowly
into
a
quarter
inch
cap
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
grass
and
spicy
noble
hops
with
a
nice
malt
backbone
it
isnt
the
most
complex
aroma
but
it
is
strong
and
what
is
there
is
very
appealing
to
me
the
taste
is
considerably
maltier
than
the
aroma
it
is
almost
maibock
like
there
is
a
long
grassy
finish
there
is
also
a
present
but
well
integrated
alcohol
note
the
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
velvety
texture
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
that
i
will
surely
drink
again
smells
and
looks
nice
but
as
far
as
taste
this
reminds
me
of
drinking
colt
45
when
i
was
19
i
expected
something
crisper
and
cleaner
or
at
least
balanced
a
rare
miss
for
odell
grab
their
ipa
instead
or
st
lupulin
when
its
in
season
this
actually
does
remind
me
of
a
helles
bock
more
than
anything
especially
the
malt
character
with
its
pale
grain
sweetness
this
doesnt
have
the
drinkability
and
lightness
that
a
normal
strength
pilsner
should
have
in
fact
i
wish
that
it
did
somehow
it
would
be
nice
if
this
was
more
like
an
equivalent
of
pliny
the
elder
while
i
wasnt
expecting
this
to
be
quite
as
refreshing
as
a
pilsner
i
was
hoping
for
more
expressive
hops
and
a
touch
less
malt
than
is
here
like
i
said
this
strikes
me
more
as
a
hoppy
helles
bock
there
are
even
traditional
german
examples
of
this
than
a
double
pilsner
somehow
a
bit
dissapointing
in
the
end
bc
of
this
last
this
would
likely
hit
the
spot
in
the
march
time
frame
of
the
year
but
is
just
a
bit
too
sweet
and
chewy
for
me
at
this
moment
overall
decent
i
cant
say
ive
had
many
examples
of
doubleimperial
pilsner
but
this
is
a
nice
clean
balanced
beer
overall
according
to
the
description
there
should
be
more
hops
presence
probably
a
good
beer
to
have
a
bmc
drinker
drink
side
by
side
to
introduce
himher
to
good
beer
ps
fuck
double
everything
really
excluding
imperial
ipastouts
which
are
better
than
their
enkel
versions
at
times
medium
bodied
decent
carbonation
and
there
is
a
sweet
aftertaste
too
sweet
for
the
style
imo
a
good
double
imperial
pilsener
but
not
as
good
as
the
boulevard
orval
collaboration
d
a
decent
beer
for
the
style
but
the
alcohol
and
sweetness
make
this
beer
a
tad
cumbersome
lots
of
flavors
to
deal
with
here
complex
yet
still
quite
drinkable
a
sipping
brew
to
say
the
least
and
a
good
example
of
the
style
as
this
one
is
a
tamer
in
the
hops
department
compared
to
other
versions
poured
a
clear
lemon
yellow
color
with
a
brilliant
white
head
and
not
alot
of
lacingsmell
is
lemon
and
grain
with
some
malts
and
hops
taste
is
the
same
its
sweet
lemon
and
citrus
with
malts
and
hops
all
mixed
in
mouth
feel
is
medium
and
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
its
easy
to
drink
its
just
not
that
tasty
to
me
clear
straw
color
with
a
large
white
head
that
had
great
retention
before
settling
to
a
thick
cap
just
a
little
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
very
active
carbonation
something
seems
off
with
the
aroma
cooked
vegetables
and
some
soggy
cardboard
is
what
i
smell
the
flavor
is
not
that
great
either
tastes
like
a
malt
liquor
albeit
a
good
malt
liquor
with
its
light
malt
and
boozy
qualities
i
am
not
picking
out
the
hop
flavor
but
the
bitterness
is
very
much
apparent
the
body
is
what
i
would
expect
in
a
double
pilsner
feels
fairly
large
and
chewy
abundantly
carbonated
but
not
harsh
this
beer
was
a
big
letdown
i
have
liked
all
the
odell
offerings
prior
to
this
beer
probably
my
favorite
double
pilsner
that
ive
had
so
far
it
has
some
of
the
tastes
that
ive
noticed
and
disliked
in
hg
malt
liquorslike
grapelike
flavors
but
theres
enough
hops
to
balance
it
out
to
make
it
more
than
just
a
craft
malt
liquor
i
would
guess
this
has
better
ingredients
than
your
typical
hg
malt
too
overall
very
impressed
a
pilsner
with
more
body
than
usual
but
not
too
heavy
this
is
the
double
pilsner
ive
tried
and
quite
enjoyed
it
d
this
beer
is
just
about
perfect
easily
the
best
double
pilsner
ive
ever
had
a
very
solid
impy
pils
by
odell
balanced
in
a
malty
sweet
warmth
and
goodness
and
somehow
still
maintainable
to
drink
down
with
a
decent
ease
well
to
a
point
anyways
as
that
warmth
really
sinks
in
i
should
know
better
than
doubt
odell
the
best
version
of
this
double
imperial
pilsner
style
ive
ever
had
almost
wish
id
gotten
more
than
one
bottle
surprisingly
drinkable
if
you
can
get
past
the
initial
overwhelming
sweetness
solid
effort
could
be
better
look
i
enjoy
big
beers
just
as
much
as
the
next
guy
belgian
quads
double
and
tripple
ipas
russian
imperial
stouts
theyre
all
delicious
high
alcohol
percentages
while
they
arent
necessarily
required
in
those
styles
dont
take
anything
away
from
them
either
however
with
the
lighter
style
of
beers
especially
the
golden
lager
category
theres
just
nowhere
for
the
alcohol
to
go
in
most
cases
especially
in
this
one
this
causes
alcohol
to
overpower
what
otherwise
might
be
a
great
beer
though
theres
no
real
way
for
you
to
know
unfortunately
in
the
case
of
odells
imperial
pilsner
this
means
the
beer
just
isnt
that
enjoyable
to
drink
its
an
interesting
experiment
in
brewing
but
not
one
ill
be
reaching
for
again
any
time
soon
drinkability
is
okay
fun
to
try
but
not
sure
id
seek
it
out
again
overall
this
beer
was
decent
but
nothing
over
the
top
i
was
expecting
a
bit
more
hops
from
a
double
pilsner
it
is
fairly
easy
to
drink
however
and
could
be
enjoyed
on
a
hot
summer
day
d
i
like
this
beer
but
i
would
want
it
more
in
the
winter
to
me
this
seems
like
it
would
have
benefitted
from
more
carbonation
there
is
very
little
carbonation
in
this
particular
beer
im
guessing
the
grain
and
hops
bill
are
very
similar
to
a
belgian
trippel
with
more
carbonation
and
a
different
yeast
this
would
have
been
a
very
nice
tripple
drinks
like
overstepping
pilsners
are
traditionally
light
refreshing
drinks
inherently
something
that
probably
shouldnt
be
imperialized
double
pils
is
an
interesting
take
on
the
style
but
a
bit
overbearing
in
terms
of
mouthfeel
and
alcohol
im
glad
i
had
only
a
small
sampler
taste
wow
for
what
stones
14th
did
for
english
ipas
is
akin
to
what
this
beer
does
in
terms
of
pilsners
i
mean
theres
flavor
and
hops
it
wasnt
just
all
carbonation
and
a
muted
combo
of
hops
and
malt
they
werent
super
bitter
like
an
ipa
they
were
just
right
youd
never
know
this
was
an
8r
a
little
expensive
so
ive
been
told
but
i
really
cant
think
of
better
pilsner
options
very
nice
beer
no
indication
that
this
is
anything
but
3
or
4
but
8
well
you
could
have
fooled
me
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
a
crisp
amount
of
carbonation
pours
a
bright
crystal
clear
gold
with
about
a
fingers
worth
of
light
white
head
head
dissipates
quickly
leaving
little
lacing

malty

and
some
floral
hop
notes
taste
is
bready
malt
up
front
then
lots
of
spiciness
floral
hops
and
alcohol
in
the
finish
ive
had
some
other
offerings
from
odell
that
had
surprisingly
high
abvs
this
wasnt
one
of
them
you
can
taste
every
bit
of
that
8
1
overall
a
good
beer
a
decent
double
pils
but
tough
to
have
more
than
one
or
two
in
a
sitting
d
it
looks
like
a
beer
you
drink
a
bunch
of
but
not
a
good
idea
big
malt
was
good
but
dry
and
alcoholic
finish
slows
me
down
notes
this
beer
seems
like
a
craft
malt
liquor
like
tool
die
from
peoples
pint
or
daddys
little
helper
from
rogue
not
a
good
pils
double
or
otherwise
poured
a
clear
light
golden
yellow
with
a
white
two
fingered
head
that
disappeared
quickly
leaving
thin
lacing
light
sweet
toasty
malt
fragrance
an
excellant
sweet
hoppy
malt
balance
on
the
palette
medium
body
with
a
descent
amount
carbonation
very
drinkable
brew
even
with
a
8
1
abv
d
too
thick
and
overly
bittersweet
for
drinking
more
than
one
at
a
time
not
a
terribly
drinkable
brew
thanks
to
fretlessman71
over
at
realbeer
for
this
one
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
my
nonic
imperial
pint
glass
the
pilsner
appears
a
hazed
golden
yellow
color
with
about
two
fingers
of
lingering
bone
white

nose
and
flavor
consist
of
grassy
earthy
hops
a
bit
of
peppery

toasted

good
dose

this
pils
is
approaching
full
bodied
with
ample
carbonation
well
done
and
thanks
again
fret
i
got
just
a
thin
white
head
with
low
retention
from
my
pour
the
color
was
a
honeylemon
yellow
with
a
slight
haze
the
nose
was
quite
malty
with
just
a
light
hop
presence
the
mouthfeel
was
mediumtothick
and
the
taste
was
quite
sweet
with
a
bit
of
an
alcohol
burn
on
the
tongue
that
last
caused
me
to
look
more
closely
at
the
label

abv
wow
after
stsphl09
yesterday
i
may
never
sober
up
at
this
rate
finish
had
a
good
hop
bite
but
i
think
that
i
would
prefer
a
single
pils
especially
if
i
were
making
an
afternoon
of
it
d
going
down
the
pipe
at
a
fair
pace
a
the

of

as
well
3

t
i
suppose
i
shouldnt
be
surprised
given
the
double
billing
but
this
beer
is
loaded
with
hops
the
alcohol
is
noticeable
a
certain
degree
of
spiciness
on
the

d
i
dig
the
hops
on
this
beer
not
sure
how
many
of
these
i
could
handle
in
a
sitting
given
the
relatively
highlevel
of
alcohol
3
75
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
for
its
8
10abv
i
would
guess
the
content
to
be
a
little
lower
very
easy
to
drink
and
rather
well
balanced
a
tasty
beer
overall
that
was
a
pleasant
surprise
for
me
d
very
easy
to
drink
despite
the
abv
md
my
bottle
seemed
a
bit
syrupy
and
a
bit
flat
maybe
its
an
old
bottle
although
it
wasnt
bad
maybe
fresh
would
be
better
im
just
not
a
fan
mouthfeel
is
decent
at
best
lingers
a
bit
on
the
palate
but
not
pleasantly
d
big
sweet
and
malty
maybe
becoming
a
touch
cloying
i
think
i
would
like
this
one
better
if
it
was
a
little
cleaner
and
crisper
drinkability
ok
pours
a
cloudy
pale
yellow
color
nice
carbonation
tiny
fizzy
white
head
with
some
minimal
sticky
lacing
the
nose
is
hoppy
with
some
malts
grapefruit
with
some
spice
the
taste
is
hoppy
malty
citrus
and
some
spicy
medium
body
drinkable
this
is
a
pretty
tasty
brew
pours
out
a
clear
dark
mustard
yellow
with
very
little
foam
slight
lacing
left
on
the
glass
smells
very
sweet
perfumy
fruity
and
floral
but
mostly
a
very
pleasant
candylike
aroma
taste
is
on
the
sweet
side
the
floral
candylike
malt
flavor
dominates
with
only
a
small
hint
of
hop
bitterness
this
was
my
first
double
pils
and
was
hoping
for
more
of
that
spicy
grassy
hop
flavor
still
this
was
not
bad
alcohol
hits
pretty
quick
but
it
was
still
very
drinkable
i
would
definitely
drink
this
again
dthe
smell
was
what
i
was
looking
for
a
good
czech
pilsener
on
steroids
highly
hopped
and
slightly
cereal
tastewise
it
veers
too
much
into
the
sweet
realm
while
not
bad
i
would
prefer
it
to
be
a
bit
sweeter
still
this
is
a
good
one
dp
to
try
d
i
think
one
is
enough
due
to
the
over
powering
alcohol
its
a
nice
beer
but
i
with
a
little
more
balance
it
could
be
amazing
overcarbonated
for
me
but
pilsners
are
typically
that
way
finishes
slightly
bitter
and
clean
and
drinks
well
this
is
definitely
a
beer
to
drink
slowly
dnot
one
i
would
want
all
the
time
but
being
that
its
limited
release
i
woul
pick
up
a
6
everytime
it
comes
around
d
this
is
pretty
good
but
powerful
both
in
flavor
and
in
alcohol
making
it
hard
to
have
more
than
a
couple
however
i
am
glad
that
i
tried
this
for
my
100th
review
easy
to
drink
and
pretty
enjoyable
but
i
cant
help
but
think
it
could
be
so
much
better
straight
from
the
brewery
overall
i
enjoyed
the
beer
id
say
its
a
little
too
sweet
but
there
was
a
range
of
character
in
the
flavor
could
benefit
from
being
drier
getting
some
more
hop
aroma
and
clearing
up
that
syrupy
texture
in
the
mouthfeel
truly
luscious
body
with
a
coy
palate
fantastic
beer
this
is
an
amazing
beer
very
well
made
everything
is
well
balanced
and
profiles
the
hops
and
alcohol
in
this
beer
very
well
thanks
brewjones
for
the
opportunity
and
gilgarp
for
the
chance
to
try
it
with
a
little
age
pours
a
nearly
crystal
clear
yellow
with
a
small
quickly
dissipating
head
smells
earthy
lemony
and
a
little
piney
initial
taste
is
sweet
and
citrusy
the
malt
character
really
steals
the
show
here
further
down
the
glass
the
bitter
piney
taste
of
the
hops
begins
to
shine
through
body
is
medium
to
light
overall
i
typically
am
not
that
excited
by
pilsners
but
i
think
that
this
would
be
something
i
would
purchase
occasionally
if
available
in
my
area
d
very
drinkable
given
its
abv
like
a
pils
on
steroids
good
stuff
the
body
is
moderate
to
full
some
sweetness
in
the
finish
but
still
a
nice
clean
flavor
feels
full
attenuated
for
sure
very
enjoyable
beer
that
imo
is
under
rated
maybe
a
bit
hoppy
for
style
but
a
double
pils
is
more
of
a
us
beer
so
bring
it
on
i
look
forward
to
having
the
morimoto
imperial
pilsner
to
compare
with
this
one
all
in
all
im
disappointed
as
ive
come
to
respect
odells
but
am
not
fond
of
this
at
all
flavor
is
fresh
and
green
a
semisour
grassy
funk
hits
the
palate
first
followed
by
a
malty
sweetness
hops
wait
until
the
end
of
the
ride
to
rear
their
bitter
citrus
heads
as
im
coming
to
realize
about
all
odells
brews
the
mouthfeel
is
ubercrisp
and
well
carbonated
body
is
a
bit
light
for
the
abv
and
style
but
still
good
overall
a
refreshing
flavorful
brew
that
id
probably
go
for
again
d
pretty
drinkable
but
one
is
definitely
enough
the
alcohol
really
gets
in
there
and
is
kinda
annoying
in
the
taste
it
is
quite
flavorful
but
not
really
my
thing
this
is
a
wellmade
brew
a
tradtional
pils
that
has
been
pumpedup
drinkable
despite
alcohol
notes
this
beer
poured
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
nice
two
finger
head
it
smelled
of
spicy
hops
with
a
golden
maltiness
the
taste
is
considerably
sweeter
and
malty
than
i
expected
while
it
certainly
has
the
light
to
medium
body
i
was
looking
for
it
wasnt
nearly
as
crisp
as
i
expected
overall
this
beer
is
light
and
flavorful
with
the
alcohol
hidden
well
if
you
want
the
best
beer
of
this
style
in
the
known
universe
pick
up
some
samuel
adams
hallertau
imperial
pilsner
that
said
odell
double
pilsner
is
a
damn
good
effort
i
hope
this
a
seasonal
release
because
id
love
to
drink
it
again
isnt
it
about
time
that
these
guys
expand
their
distribution
to
iowa
it
is
drinkable
but
the
alcohol
will
creep
up
on
you
if
youre
not
careful
a
very
interesting
brew
i
give
it
extra
points
for
originality
because
ive
never
had
anything
quite
like
it
i
think
ill
have
another
i
want
to
like
this
beer
absent
the
diacetyl
this
would
be
altogether
good
and
tasty
as
is
i
would
pass
at
first
glance
the
double
pilsner
doesnt
look
like
much
as
soon
as
the
nose
hit
me
however
i
knew
i
was
in
for
an
experience
the
nose
and
the
taste
both
reminded
me
of
the
smell
of
honeysuckles
on
a
summer
night
kind
of
specific
but
thats
what
i
got
very
floral
and
smooth
and
it
masked
its
high
alcohol
content
well
i
could
see
myself
enjoying
a
few
of
these
outside
on
a
warm
night
thanks
to
gbontrag
for
this
one
d
this
was
pretty
good
it
didnt
look
or
smell
to
great
but
it
had
a
really
nice
flavor
delicious
doubles
pils
from
odell
i
like
double
and
imperial
variations
on
beer
styles
this
is
a
great
german
pils
with
some
iron
pumped
to
it
meine
freunde
aufschlagen
very
nice
straw
color
good
white
head
nice
lacing
nice
spicy
aroma
with
some
pale
malt
scents
excellent
flavor
with
fantastic
malt
backbone
fleshed
out
with
spicy
noble
hop
flavors
great
beer
from
a
great
little
brewing
company
in
fort
collins
usa
these
guys
need
more
kudos
this
beer
poured
a
straw
color
golden
almost
looks
like
a
chardonay
not
a
strong
head
or
much
lacing
but
a
nice
grassy
citrusy
smell
lemons
prevalent
in
the
aroma
the
taste
was
even
better
they
achieved
good
balance
between
hops
and
malt
i
was
expecting
a
stronger
hoppy
taste
but
was
surprized
by
the
candylike
sweetness
of
the
beer
from
the
malts
there
was
an
interesting
combination
between
the
citrus
smells
and
tastes
and
the
sweet
candy
flavors
sort
of
like
lemon
drops
sugery
and
tart
that
was
really
nice
this
is
a
very
smooth
beer
and
the
higher
alcohol
concentration
isnt
noticeble
imo
smooth
soft
mouthfeel
still
with
good
carbonation
but
not
overpowering
very
good
beer
pleasant
experience
i
was
hesitent
to
buy
it
with
its
12
price
tag
for
a
sixpack
but
with
the
quality
of
the
brew
it
was
worth
it
md
medium
bodied
more
so
than
i
expected
after
seeing
the
pour
and
the
crispness
of
the
beer
biscuity
would
be
a
good
term
however
that
medicinal
quality
throws
the
drinkability
off
slightly
the
aroma
was
an
earthy
hop
smell
the
color
was
clear
golden
with
a
bubbly
white
head
taste
was
sticky
slightly
sweet
earthy
and
good
i
liked
this
probably
the
best
pilsener
i
have
ever
had
it
certainly
had
an
imperial
feel
to
it
i
now
need
to
go
buy
a
sixer
of
this
for
the
old
fridge
the
only
thing
that
suffers
here
is
drinkability
but
that
is
to
be
expected
with
a
double
pilsener
kicking
it
up
a
notch
for
a
bbq
weekend
pilsners
are
just
perfect
for
the
summer
it
poured
a
golden
color
with
a
two
finger
head
nice
crisp
aroma
the
double
hits
you
on
the
palate
much
maltier
than
most
pilsners
and
the
alcohol
is
driven
home
i
would
have
preferred
it
to
be
more
refreshing
but
as
a
double
pilsner
this
is
perhaps
what
i
should
have
expected
a
well
crafted
brew
regardless
but
should
be
taken
in
moderation
taste
follows
aroma
nice
malty
start
then
moves
to
more
of
a
mild
spice
and
herbal
flavor
hops
nip
the
malt
quick
and
subtle
some
citrus
and
herbal
spice
comes
into
shape
but
is
quited
by
a
grainymalt
finish
crisp
though
i
like
this
goes
well
in
the
warm
evening
perhaps
a
bit
pricey
but
worth
it
drinks
good
for
the
abv
not
as
flavorful
as
last
year
but
still
pretty
damn
good
a
bit
pricey
at
10
sixer
this
is
one
great
pilsner
or
should
i
say
double
pilsner
drink
on
friends
what
a
delightful
surprise
this
is
the
best
odell
brew
ive
had
get
some
of
this
highly
recommended
not
too
bad
another
good
one
from
odell
a
great
addition
to
odells
line
up
a
must
try
that
goes
beyond
most
bohemian
pilsners
but
adds
some
american
style
hopping
wish
it
had
a
touch
more
hop
flavor
to
balance
the
sweetness
but
overall
a
good
beer
i
would
drink
more
drinkable
and
flavorful
not
a
particular
favorite
but
not
a
bad
choice
d
a
tasty
brew
that
i
cant
decide
if
it
has
improved
or
worsened
over
time
since
i
last
tasted
one
many
months
ago
regardless
i
recommended
trying
this
out
if
you
can
its
a
very
drinkable
brew
that
hides
its
alcohol
well
and
is
interesting
enough
to
keep
you
coming
back
overall
impression
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
beer
and
it
hides
the
alcohol
suprisingly
well
dangerous
nice
balance
of
flavors
i
would
love
to
see
this
become
a
year
round
offering
i
only
had
one
of
these
and
im
not
sure
when
ill
finish
the
rest
of
the
sixer
for
11
i
probably
wouldnt
buy
any
more
for
a
similar
taste
i
would
probably
go
with
something
more
ordinary
like
pilsner
urquell
or
some
euro
lager
i
had
been
looking
around
for
this
beer
for
a
while
i
was
expecting
a
lot
more
from
a
double
pilsner
cheers
thick
mouthfeel
and
moderate
carbonation
nice
beer
but
not
one
i
need
to
spent
11
on
for
a
6pack
mouthfeel
is
reasonably
full
medium
bodied
really
light
carbonation
only
lends
a
little
crispness
good
drinkability
but
the
sweetness
is
a
bit
much
for
me
to
have
too
many
overall
a
solid
beer
for
the
style
on
the
palate
whoa
is
this
a
mai
bock
big
malt
flavor
good
saaz
spice
but
then
a
malty
flavored
alcoholic
hot
whop
finishes
out
the
flavor
finish
is
alcohol
dominant
with
some
lingering
sweetness
i
dont
mind
the
latter
charactersistics
due
to
a
preference
for
maibocks
but
those
not
preferring
such
a
beer
may
want
to
pass
on
this
offering
from
odell
another
treat
from
liquor
mart
on
my
last
stop
lovely
pour
into
the
duvel
tulip
glass
clear
clean
golden
yellow
body
with
a
pillowy
dense
creamy
white
head
pungeant
honey
malt
mixes
with
cantaloupe
and
fruity
alcohol
saazish
hop
aroma
of
sea
air
taste
doesnt
disappoint
herbal
bitter
hop
edge
up
front
that
lasts
throughout
and
intensifies
in
the
finish
sweet
smooth
fruit
and
honey
malt
come
through
midpalate
providing
balance
the
hop
flavor
is
perfect
for
the
honey
candy
malt
intensity
a
winner
mediumfull
bodied
with
a
nearsyrupy
feel
it
clings
to
the
inside
of
the
mouth
reminds
me
of
rogues
a
big
compliment
the
only
changes
i
could
say
for
sure
is
that
i
now
find
it
more
drinkable
than
in
my
first
review
and
it
seems
to
have
a
better
nose
i
dont
know
what
happened
but
dang
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
this
time
around
and
my
new
scoring
will
reflect
that
darn
good
stuff
odell
has
done
a
great
job
with
this
one
with
this
brew
in
their
lineup
they
continue
to
build
their
case
as
one
of
the
most
underrated
breweries
in
north
america
what
a
shame
this
is
a
limited
edition
this
beer
is
crisp
easy
to
drink
quite
good
its
also
oddly
refreshing
in
spite
of
the
high
alcohol
content
id
highly
recommend
seeking
this
one
out
well
worth
the
trouble
drinkability
very
drinkable
beer
but
would
limit
intake
because
of
the
alcohol
content
its
definitely
not
a
lawnmower
beer
but
its
an
excellent
example
of
what
i
envision
a
double
pilsner
style
would
be
wonderful
beer
o
this
beer
is
more
akin
to
a
dipa
than
any
pilsner
or
other
lager
ive
ever
had
it
sets
an
impression
of
a
homebrewer
brewing
up
a
heavyhitting
beer
just
because
he
can
lots
of
hops
no
matter
the
flavor
and
lots
of
alcohol
because
there
are
so
many
lightweight
beers
to
be
shamed
just
too
harsh
unpleasant
on
my
palate
i
feel
like
i
have
to
try
their
bohemian
pils
just
to
see
if
they
can
mellow
out
a
much
as
they
can
ramp
up
mouthfeel
is
bitter
crisp
and
decently
balanced
with
high
amounts
of
hoppy
oils
and
resin
had
it
on
tap
at
my
local
bar
strong
but
not
overpowering
pretty
drinkable
but
not
something
to
session
with
the
bitterness
really
struck
me
as
i
dont
often
find
many
beers
bitterness
catching
my
attention
tried
it
because
solemn
oath
is
a
local
brewery
and
i
enjoy
imperial
pilsners
neighbor
brought
a
growler
home
from
solemn
oath
the
beer
poured
a
lightgolden
color
with
thin
white
head
that
dissipated
toward
the
bottom
the
scent
had
a
subtle
piney
notes
mixed
with
typical
pilsner
grassy
tones
the
taste
had
the
common
grassy
hop
character
of
most
pilsners
but
this
was
balanced
nicely
with
a
sweeter
malt
the
mouthfeel
was
a
medium
body
beer
with
ok
carbonation
overall
it
was
a
very
good
beer
and
would
highly
recommend
it
this
is
a
very
tasty
ipl
i
believe
the
key
to
enjoying
this
beer
is
to
allow
it
to
warm
the
complexity
of
the
malt
truly
shines
as
the
temp
climbs
it
is
dangerously
quaffable
for
its
high
abv
another
winner
from
indeed
i
feel
like
i
could
drink
the
entire
4
pack
but
i
need
to
work
in
a
few
hours
i
dont
really
get
the
imperial
lager
angle
none
of
the
clean
crisp
flavors
i
love
in
lagers
in
this
one
even
though
there
are
plenty
of
interesting
things
going
on
in
terms
of
the
flavor
profile
honey
is
quite
pronounced
as
are
some
relatively
complex
floral
and
orchard
notes
fairly
heavy
and
slick
mouthful
kind
of
a
clumsy
lager
yeasthoney
mash
up
it
doesnt
come
together
as
well
as
i
had
hoped
maybe
the
pilsner
yeast
had
some
trouble
finishing
this
8
7
monster
pretty
good
stuff
for
a
lager
can
see
myself
drinking
enough
of
this
on
a
hot
summer
day
and
falling
off
a
deck
somewhere
radiant
golden
brew
smells
like
a
standard
lager
nothing
special
here
taste
is
honey
and
a
little
boozy
ok
flavor
for
a
springtime
beer
one
of
my
favorite
thing
about
lagers
though
is
their
sessionability
and
at
8
this
beer
destroys
that
benefit
this
beer
pours
a
clear
bright
gold
color
the
head
is
a
massive
two
and
a
half
inches
of
billowy
white
foam
that
recedes
slowly
leaving
nice
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
honey
lavender
hibiscus
and
chrysanthemum
there
is
a
lot
going
on
in
this
aroma
and
it
seems
that
a
different
flower
sticks
out
with
every
whiff
the
taste
is
sweeter
than
the
aroma
with
lots
of
honey
up
front
the
finish
is
much
more
floral
than
the
sip
and
lingers
nicely
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
smooth
texture
and
lively
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
really
well
crafted
beer
that
i
can
see
drinking
regularly
when
it
is
available
overall
really
good
of
course
you
have
to
like
sweet
beers
but
this
beer
is
sweet
without
being
syrupy
or
heavy
despite
its
high
abv
i
hope
i
can
find
some
more
cans
of
this
no
thanks
mexican
honey
pours
a
hazish
golden
color
with
a
big
long
lasting
white
head
there
is
a
big
crisp
malty
aroma
with
hints
of
honey
and
spices
the
taste
is
very
crisp
with
a
big
sweetness
and
hints
of
bitter
honey
good
feel
body
is
a
little
weak
very
refreshing
overall
its
different
good
sweet
flavors
this
was
an
interesting
beer
at
first
i
thought
it
was
just
ok
and
hid
the
alc
content
very
well
i
picked
up
on
the
honey
flavor
early
on
but
it
changed
a
little
the
emptier
the
bottle
got
it
definitely
grew
on
me
the
more
i
drank
by
the
time
i
emptied
the
bottle
i
couldn
t
believe
it
was
already
gone
at
first
sip
you
think
it
is
just
ok
but
by
the
end
you
are
wanting
more
and
wondering
where
it
all
went
another
great
beer
by
the
guys
at
indeed
overall
a
pretty
good
take
on
a
bigger
pilsner
the
added
honey
adds
a
nice
sweet
kick
without
making
things
overly
sweet
overall
good
imperial
lager
with
lots
of
taste
and
a
nice
citrus
and
mead
profile
from
the
mexican
honey
i
like
the
way
honey
can
both
provide
a
sweet
taste
and
a
dry
finish
could
have
used
a
little
more
hops
for
balance
instead
of
primarily
relying
on
the
dried
out
honey
finish
but
very
good
nonetheless
has
some
amazing
features
keep
these
unusual
beers
coming
indeed
another
winner
a
clear
yellow
gold
color
with
a
flimsy
white
film
on
top
but
very
impressive
lacing
the
aroma
is
an
odd
dank
rotting
fruit
vegetable
medley
some
white
grapes
and
potato
not
highly
attractive
the
flavor
keeps
you
on
guard
with
a
boozy
vegetable
funkiness
that
is
hard
to
warm
up
to
there
are
some
bready
characteristics
and
an
unusual
peppery
idea
that
is
unlike
most
chili
pepper
type
brews
its
a
bit
of
a
chemical
idea
here
in
conjunction
with
the
alcohol
and
not
thrilling
to
these
taste
buds
theres
a
sickly
honey
sweetness
in
there
but
its
very
hard
to
define
like
water
chestnuts
with
a
swampy
malaise
theres
a
little
bit
of
lemony
grass
hop
in
there
but
it
doesnt
rescue
this
in
my
mind
its
pretty
much
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
tangy
clean
feel
but
overall
im
not
planning
to
revisit
this
frankenbeer
owell
done
double
lager
so
tasty
and
smooth
abv
hidden
o
a
fairly
decent
pils
with
a
good
blend
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
from
this
but
turned
out
to
be
a
good
hopped
pils
that
i
wouldnt
run
tell
everyone
about
but
would
certainly
drink
again
if
presented
o
pretty
decent
flavors
for
a
one
hop
double
pilsner
with
a
hefty
abv
to
boot
but
im
just
not
that
crazy
over
it
it
doesnt
taste
a
whole
lot
like
a
pilsner
which
was
what
i
expecting
i
really
like
sam
adams
noble
pils
and
the
double
version
didnt
disappoint
pours
hazy
orange
with
nice
white
lacing
sweet
somewhat
sticky
green
apples
peaches
and
citrus
emerge
finishes
with
a
spicy
note
more
similar
to
a
double
ipa
than
a
stereotypical
pilsner
o
using
current
parlance
this
is
a
good
singlehop
ipl
or
imperial
pilsner
well
i
will
enjoy
my
other
3
with
reviews
lower
than
their
other
imperial
pilsner
this
is
a
close
clone
but
not
as
great
as
it
could
have
been
3
645
nice
example
of
a
style
i
dont
really
like
overall
a
very
impressive
sign
of
the
whats
to
come
if
i
try
the
rest
of
the
adventures
in
lager
mixed
case
i
bought
from
sam
adams
drink
up
while
its
fresh
overall
i
love
my
sam
and
this
is
a
great
offering
from
them
a
great
find
that
i
wouldnt
mind
having
around
regularly
pilsners
tend
to
be
a
bit
grassy
and
light
for
my
liking
but
this
one
is
anything
but
golden
copper
earthy
hops
in
the
nose
more
malty
than
hoppy
still
this
offering
possesses
a
nice
bitterness
and
is
fairly
drinkable
for
an
8
6
in
short
this
beer
is
so
dry
and
yet
so
creamy
quite
an
amazing
beer
this
beer
pours
out
as
a
traditional
style
pilsner
with
a
yellow
colored
body
the
head
is
what
sets
it
apart
from
most
pilsners
the
retention
on
this
is
very
good
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
super
hoppy
and
very
inviting
the
taste
is
very
hoppy
as
well
and
really
makes
this
pilsner
more
enjoyable
than
just
the
normal
grassy
flavor
that
most
have
this
brew
is
more
like
an
ipa
in
my
opinion
which
really
tastes
great
the
mouthfeel
remains
light
and
drinkable
overall
this
brew
is
very
good
and
im
looking
forward
to
having
it
again
this
is
a
taste
for
hopheads
built
into
an
imperial
pilsner
sam
adams
doesnt
make
their
ipas
usually
with
that
much
hops
strange
they
went
big
on
this
one
and
i
like
the
results
quite
bitter
but
zesty
lemon
citrus
hop
flavors
driving
the
bitterness
has
a
little
bit
of
the
lager
yeast
flavor
that
was
complimented
by
the
massive
hop
burst
dont
know
if
this
is
exclusively
hallertau
but
whatever
proportion
it
works
nicely
to
create
a
strong
ass
beer
worthy
of
spring
early
summer
time
d
it
is
a
good
beer
i
really
think
this
is
one
of
the
better
sam
adams
beers
that
is
available
they
ever
going
to
release
this
again
d
a
must
have
for
any
hop
head
this
is
not
for
beginner
beer
drinkers
not
a
session
beer
probably
best
to
be
shared
with
others
to
savor
each
sip
this
beer
pours
a
copper
color
with
a
slighty
off
color
head
the
smell
is
an
intense
noble
hop
character
the
taste
of
this
beer
is
extremely
bitter
the
bitterness
lingers
a
long
time
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
for
a
pilsner
this
is
a
sipping
beer
its
not
bad
but
wow
it
is
an
imperial
pours
an
orangeish
color
with
a
light
tan
head
in
the
aroma
hallertau
hops
stand
out
with
a
nice
dry
malt
in
the
taste
dry
hops
dry
malt
which
is
quite
balanced
with
a
small
hint
of
alcohol
a
smooth
and
medium
to
big
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
small
hop
and
small
alcohol
hint
in
the
aftertaste
big
hops
and
a
small
alcohol
hint
quite
ipa
like
but
you
can
tell
it
is
a
pilsner
good
nonetheless
overall
this
probably
should
be
slipped
back
into
rotation
at
boston
beer
cant
really
say
this
beer
has
peaked
this
one
actually
tastes
like
a
double
pilsener
very
interesting
beer
shumistafeb

but
i
remember
it
being
a
little
more
pronounced
the
first
time
as
far
as
the
hops
jul
24
2009
d
higher
than
expected
the
big
ibus
keep
the
malt
in
line
d
if
you
like
hops
this
one
has
them
dont
know
if
i
could
drink
a
bunch
of
this
but
its
good
d
hmm
this
is
an
incredible
big
beer
but
i
dont
really
know
if
id
want
more
than
one
per
sitting
thats
a
wallop
for
the
age
it
doesnt
show
it
being
old
id
love
to
try
a
fresh
one
and
see
how
much
more
intense
the
experience
is
this
came
in
a
bottle
it
had
probably
mellowed
a
little
because
it
sat
in
my
closet
for
a
few
months
the
beer
is
a
little
cloudy
somewhere
between
yellow
gold
and
brown
more
on
the
lighter
side
but
not
light
like
a
typical
pilsner
the
smell
is
a
little
too
maltsweet
scented
it
tastes
a
lot
like
a
double
ipa
except
with
more
intense
hops
if
you
can
beleive
that
the
sweetness
in
the
scent
doesnt
come
through
too
much
in
the
taste
the
beer
has
a
decent
aftertaste
with
citrus
being
the
dominant
flavor
the
intense
hop
taste
makes
this
beer
not
so
drinkable
i
couldnt
really
go
past
a
single
definitely
worth
a
try
the
bbc
really
does
make
some
fing
intensely
flavorful
beers
when
it
wants
to
this
is
one
of
them
what
i
will
say
for
sure
is
that
this
is
still
a
great
beer
regardless
of
some
age
its
goldenamber
body
was
always
a
bit
hazy
and
it
still
has
a
creamy
offwhite
head
that
holds
well
and
leaves
a
wide
ring
of
lace
at
the
outset
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
floral
spicy
and
gently
grassy
over
a
carameldrizzled
biscuitlike
maltiness
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumfull
and
creamy
smooth
the
flavor
follows
the
aroma
and
the
malt
and
hops
balance
well
with
the
hop
flavors
draping
themselves
over
the
velvety
maltiness
and
a
solid
bitterness
anchoring
the
maltiness
from
within
tasting
this
i
thought
yes
thats
the
hoppiness
of
the
boston
lager
the
hallertau
mittelfrue
its
kind
of
spicy
and
zesty
very
nice
i
poured
into
a
pint
glass
to
a
half
inch
of
white
head
i
really
like
the
smell
i
can
smell
a
nice
blending
of
malt
and
hops
i
taste
the
malts
up
front
but
the
more
i
drink
the
more
the
hops
come
through
it
has
a
thick
body
just
like
my
bitch
it
is
a
very
nice
beer
i
enjoyed
it
i
kind
of
wish
i
had
the
whole
four
pack
oh
well
theres
more
beer
in
the
fridge
i
was
really
surprised
by
this
beer
there
have
been
a
few
offerings
from
sam
adams
that
i
have
enjoyed
but
this
one
is
really
special
pours
a
standard
golden
color
with
a
white
head
the
nose
is
where
things
get
interesting
loads
and
loads
of
hops
the
taste
is
great
with
tons
of
floral
hop
presence
and
a
smooth
crisp
finish
not
a
lot
of
overwhelming
bitterness
either
the
malt
sweetness
balances
the
beer
out
nicely
id
definitely
recommend
this
beer
to
hop
heads
or
anyone
else
interested
in
trying
a
pilsner
of
a
different
color
d
despite
its
8
1
abv
it
is
well
balanced
all
around
a
refreshing
and
different
variation
from
your
run
of
the
mill
ipa
the
alcohol
will
sneak
up
on
you
if
u
have
at
least
2
of
these
i
think
that
the
overall
age
helped
this
out
alot
this
is
easily
still
good
even
after
the
suggested
drink
by
month
of
january
2009
da
very
refined
wellbalanced
pilsner
matter
of
fact
the
best
pilsner
ive
tasted
thus
far
if
youre
a
hophead
this
is
an
excellent
choice
just
be
forewarned
more
than
two
of
these
monsters
will
turn
your
lips
into
flypaper
drinkability
wow
is
this
beer
not
for
the
non
hophead
but
i
knew
that
coming
in
i
found
this
beer
a
little
rough
but
thats
more
because
of
my
tastes
than
the
beers
fault
a
12
ounce
bottle
purchased
at
the
beer
stop
for
2
50
poured
into
a
nonic
pint
glass
and
appears
a
hazed
rich
apricot
color
with
about
an
inch
of
pillowy
off
white
foam
smells
and
tastes
of
sweet
toasted
grains
bread
piney
hops
citrus
such
as
orange
lemon
and
grapefruit
followed
by
a
healthy
dose
of
caramelized
alts
to
pull
it
all
together
this
pilsner
falls
somewhere
between
medium
and
full
bodied
with
ample
carbonation
great
drinkability
even
after
factoring
in
the
high
abv
definitely
a
strong
focus
on
the
hops
but
nicely
balanced
with
a
chewey
biscuity
malt
character
that
makes
this
very
special
pretty
complex
and
well
balanced
this
is
my
first
imperial
pilsner
so
its
a
bit
difficult
to
call
this
one
so
naively
ill
keep
it
simple
and
say
it
surpassed
my
expectations
with
high
complexity
enjoyable
flavors
and
a
great
mouthfeel
if
this
is
a
session
beer
then
it
is
a
short
session
at
8
1
abv
dont
take
my
word
check
it
out
for
yourself
drinkability
my
first
ever
imperial
pilsner
and
i
liked
it
didnt
expect
the
hop
experience
to
really
be
as
intense
as
advertised
but
it
certainly
was
nicely
done
sa
d
this
is
definitely
a
beer
that
i
would
only
want
to
have
one
of
in
a
sitting
took
me
awhile
to
finish
one
future
outlook
first
imperial
pilsner
that
ive
had
and
it
was
indeed
a
very
good
interesting
beer
dont
recall
ever
seeing
this
available
around
here
but
would
like
to
try
again
next
year
if
it
makes
it
if
you
like
hops
you
will
love
this
beer
i
drink
as
much
of
it
as
i
can
find
looks
real
nice
as
it
pours
a
slightly
hazy
orange
and
puts
up
a
1
finger
head
that
quickly
settles
down
to
a
thin
film
floral
and
fruity
aromas
among
the
hop
presence
taste
is
a
bit
citric
with
hop
oils
but
nice
theres
a
lot
going
on
here
finish
is
i
dont
know
resiny
mouthfeel
is
quite
thick
this
sticks
around
for
a
while
ive
always
known
pilsners
to
be
dry
and
snappy
this
is
my
first
doubleimperial
so
is
this
true
to
the
style
i
dont
really
know
good
enough
of
a
brew
though
leaves
some
lace
on
the
glass
and
lingering
floral
hopbittercaramel
malt
tastes
on
the
palate
alcohol
becomes
noticeable
as
it
warms
really
excellent
beer
a
the
color
of
dark
honey
thin
layer
of
head
that
stuck
around
for
quite
a
while

so
slightly

t
the
label
says
an
intense
hop
experience
and
that
seems
very
appropriate
loads
of
bittering

dominate
the

d
as
a
lover
of
hops
this
is
an
easy
beer
to
enjoy
as
there
is
no
shortage
of
them
3
50
d
it
is
a
good
beer
but
it
can
be
harsh
at
times
one
or
two
at
max
in
one
sitting
d
a
very
tasty
beer
but
a
tad
bit
over
the
top
probably
wouldnt
want
to
have
more
than
one
or
two
of
these
at
a
time
i
admit
in
the
past
i
have
been
quick
to
judge
a
sa
product
generalizing
them
as
ok
but
definitively
not
stellar
for
their
styles
this
guy
really
proved
me
they
are
more
than
capable
brewers
sweet
and
syrupy
upfront
with
low
carbonation
in
the
finish
this
is
a
fairly
smooth
pilsner
that
goes
down
pretty
easy
given
the
abv
and
bitterness
levels
easily
the
best
offering
ive
tried
from
bbc
to
date
and
one
that
i
will
probably
never
get
tired
of
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pilsner
glass
pours
a
very
cloudy
orange
gold
yellow
color
you
can
even
see
this
vibrant
cloudy
color
through
the
brown
bottle
lots
of
hop
sediment
floating
around
as
well
great
appearence
nice
fluffy
off
white
head
that
sticks
around
for
awhile
nice
lacing
nice
retention
the
aroma
is
obviously
very
hoppy
but
its
not
as
huge
as
the
taste
suggests
a
light
pilsner
type
malt
aroma
as
well
the
taste
is
that
of
some
really
strong
earthy
spicy
hops
all
the
way
through
very
heavy
strong
mouthfeel
the
hops
really
linger
perhaps
a
tad
bit
of
an
alcohol
taste
not
a
great
balance
to
this
one
but
its
definately
what
the
label
suggests
a
hop
experience
reminds
me
a
lot
of
a
double
ipa
its
not
very
drinkable
due
to
the
high
abv
definately
a
sipper
this
is
prolly
one
of
the
best
offerings
from
sam
adams
that
ive
ever
had
i
would
definately
suggest
it
to
anyone
that
enjoys
hoppy
beers
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
but
a
nice
beer
at
first
taste
it
was
alot
of
hops
however
after
digesting
what
the
taste
was
it
was
fantastic
after
the
initial
shock
of
the
hoppiness
of
the
beer
it
was
great
it
has
fantastic
smell
and
drinkability
the
smell
is
what
a
beer
should
smell
like
a
very
good
entry
d
not
too
high
in
abv
or
do
overly
pronounced
in
flavors
good
for
session
if
not
a
tough
one
bruised
banana
with
apricot
indeed
excellent
and
precise
some
of
the
greatest
descriptive
writing
ive
had
the
pleasure
to
run
across
thank
you
buckeye
i
found
this
to
be
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
am
sort
of
a
hophead
however
bbc
clearly
achieved
what
they
wanted
with
this
brew
connesiours
of
robust
in
your
face
beer
will
love
this
the
carbonation
is
a
bit
poor
on
the
pour
orange
in
tint
head
is
white
lace
not
really
expected
on
that
part
not
too
crisp
peppery
hop
orange
wood
malt
or
more
so
blanding
if
thats
even
a
word
quality
malt
a
strange
marco
marketing
tool
of
beer
that
isnt
accessible
for
the
norm
good
beer
doesnt
serve
much
of
a
place
i
mean
as
an
imperial
pilsner
too
much
malt
not
refreshing
but
american
hoppy
not
what
i
look
for
in
a
pilsner
or
an
american
imperial
pilsner
for
that
if
that
type
is
even
justified
the
metallica
of
beer
rather
silly
to
drink
twice
im
sure
it
would
be
indiscernible
in
the
face
of
a
selection
of
ipas
not
a
palate
thing
more
so
a
pedantic
attempt
all
in
all
an
excellent
brew
its
my
first
imperial
pilsner
and
i
will
definitely
be
seeking
out
more
very
much
like
a
mellowed
ipa
glad
to
finally
try
this
beer
i
cant
get
over
how
good
this
is
a
pilsner
that
drinks
like
a
double
ipa
but
with
great
balance
ive
liked
sam
adams
beers
but
never
really
been
blown
away
until
now
beer
pours
golden
orange
with
a
thick
off
white
head
alot
of
bubbles
came
pouring
out
of
the
bottle
upon
opening
drank
this
on
feb
13
best
before
date
on
bottle
was
january
2009
this
may
explain
the
lack
of
aroma
i
detected
some
faint
citrus
and
maltiness
but
nothing
even
remotely
strong
however
this
brew
is
rather
tasty
very
hoppy
with
some
slight
malt
sweetness
to
even
things
out
strong
grapefruit
like
aftertaste
which
lingers
quite
a
while
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
heavy
with
the
aforementioned
aftertaste
very
prominent
not
in
a
bad
way
though
overall
i
do
like
this
beer
if
sam
adams
were
to
get
into
the
ipa
game
this
would
be
a
good
place
to
start
for
sure
uhg
this
is
not
good
for
me
too
bitter
my
word
i
will
admit
that
i
prefer
malt
to
hops
but
good
lord
this
is
too
extreme
for
me
to
even
try
to
enjoy
and
that
bitterness
just
lingers
the
whole
time
on
the
side
of
my
mouth
i
will
definitely
not
be
having
this
one
ever
again
well
balanced
seriously
holy
cow
i
cant
taste
anything
but
bitter
more
of
an
earthy
and
grassy
hop
bomb
than
the
typical
citrus
west
coast
ipa
bitterness
is
very
high
but
still
has
some
undertones
of
light
malty
sweetness
its
a
bit
on
the
pricey
side
but
overall
a
pleasant
drinking
experience
a
nice
change
of
pace
hop
bomb
with
the
hallertau
very
unsam
adamsy
feel
to
it
might
revisit
again
next
year
but
splitting
a
4pack
would
be
fine
with
me
pours
a
cloudy
golden
orange
one
finger
plus
white
head
with
excellent
retention
and
laceing
aroma
is
of
fruity
citrus
hops
and
some
bready
malts
body
is
this
and
carbonated
taste
is
a
creamy
mike
of
fruitypiney
hops
and
a
malty
carmel
sweetness
really
good
kinda
cloudy
orange
as
it
pours
from
the
bottle
some
yeast
chunks
fall
out
head
took
a
pour
down
the
center
of
the
glass
to
induce
floral
citrussy
aroma
lots
o
hops
sharp
bitterness
malty
sweet
but
not
cloying
and
nice
hop
flavor
its
like
a
dog
fish
head
ipa
without
the
cloying
sweetness
and
crass
hop
flavor
the
hops
are
very
nice
it
tastes
like
a
good
double
ipa
with
some
perfume
in
it
a
shame
that
mine
wasnt
fresher
i
will
aim
to
get
them
immediately
upon
release
in
the
future
overall
this
is
the
only
imperial
pils
i
have
ever
tried
and
i
do
enjoy
it
but
feel
like
there
must
be
something
that
can
show
it
up
d
this
is
the
first
hoppy
beer
and
i
ever
had
and
i
got
to
say
i
enjoyed
it
its
what
got
me
into
ipas
and
american
barleywines
its
hoppiness
is
the
only
thing
that
cuts
down
on
its
drinkability
nikki
medium
body
with
a
crispy
mouthfeel
and
the
alcohol
well
masked
a
pleasure
to
drink
and
definetly
a
brew
that
i
recommend
to
any
type
of
beer
lover
cheers

d
the
brew
is
good
but
one
beer
is
plenty
due
to
the
crazy
revolving
taste
d
noble
hops
are
kind
of
a
onetrick
pony
but
the
overall
effect
is
so
pleasant
that
i
could
easily
have
several
back
to
back
if
it
werent
for
the
9
abv
that
is
this
one
is
so
close
to
an
ipa
and
so
far
removed
from
a
pils
call
it
whatever
you
want
its
damn
good
this
is
a
beer
i
have
been
looking
forward
to
trying
since
it
was
announced
in
fall
07
and
it
did
not
dissappoint
pours
a
deep
cloudy
orange
and
with
an
agressive
pour
produces
a
bubbly
1
head
that
dissapates
fairly
fast
into
a
thin
foam
that
sticks
around
hops
and
spice
in
the
nose
with
some
floral
hints
to
note
some
bready
smelling
malt
in
the
backround
floral
hops
and
malt
hit
the
tastebuds
at
1st
sip
lacing
sticks
to
the
glass
quite
nicely
as
i
drink
finishes
bitter
with
a
slight
alcohol
warming
at
the
end
tastes
awesome
since
im
not
very
into
this
style
mouthfeel
is
full
and
complete
drinkability
is
quite
low
due
to
the
abv
very
good
brew
and
a
standout
for
style
not
a
lot
of
fruit
but
the
hops
are
very
balanced
providing
some
floral
flavors
at
the
beginning
and
then
dropping
into
a
building
hops
bitterness
thta
does
not
get
too
dry
itensity
of
flavor
builds
very
nicely
d
this
is
a
delicious
brew
that
is
hoppy
yet
balanced
i
wont
buy
any
more
this
year
as
its
going
to
lose
its
hop
bite
soon
but
next
year
ill
definitely
be
in
for
more
the
lingering
bitterness
surely
is
a
turn
off
for
some
but
if
that
is
not
an
issue
for
you
look
out
i
dont
notice
the
8abv
in
any
sensory
experience
except
for
feeling
buzzed
wish
i
had
another
i
think
that
previous
batches
of
this
beer
have
been
more
successful
based
on
memory
even
though
the
alcohol
content
has
been
lowered
this
year
i
feel
like
its
presence
sticks
out
more
flavor
is
good
but
there
is
something
going
on
with
the
aroma
in
the
bottle
that
i
have
here
it
is
a
bit
funky
and
almost
has
a
dirty
laundry
scent
to
it
overall
i
do
like
the
theme
and
inspiration
for
creating
this
beer
and
i
do
seek
it
out
whenever
they
make
it
overall
tons
of
hop
flavor
that
tend
to
blow
away
the
other
ingredients
a
must
for
all
hopheads
however
goes
great
with
spicy
foods
d
finetasting
beer
but
not
what
im
looking
for
in
a
pils
i
enjoy
it
and
would
drink
it
again
but
the
color
and
sweetness
are
really
off
for
the
style
poured
from
the
bottle
a
beautiful
translucent
orange
with
more
than
two
fingers
of
soapy
white
head
retention
is
quite
good
with
nearly
one
finger
remaining
after
34
minutes
and
a
bit
of
lacing
holds
on
plenty
of
hops
come
through
in
the
aroma
particularly
of
the
piney
variety
but
even
the
hop
smell
didnt
prepare
me
for
the
size
of
the
flavors
to
come
first
sip
is
of
a
piney
ipa
with
some
citrus
in
the
backend
the
alcohol
is
noticeable
but
only
in
combination
with
the
hops
within
the
grassy
intensely
bitter
finish
that
was
a
little
unsettling
i
think
the
bitterness
and
abv
would
keep
me
from
popping
many
more
than
one
what
an
exceptional
imperial
pilsner
theres
no
doubt
about
it
this
beer
had
a
top
notch
appearance
a
huge
bitter
scent
of
hallertau

a

very

i
agree
with
the
bottle
in
that
this
is
fairly
intense
i
would
describe
it
as
a
cross
between
a
pils
and
a
tripel

say
this

it
is

from

start
and
never
lets
off

it
has
a

to
it

is

it

the

over
at

would
pour

this
is
the
best
sam
adams
beer
i
have
ever
had
sam
adams
beers
usually
upset
my
stomach
possibly
from
the
carbonation
but
after
this
beer
i
felt
fine
with
the
high
abv
one
will
be
fine
but
a
great
offering
from
sam
and
one
i
would
enjoy
again
interesting
beer
to
say
the
least
its
absolutely
packed
to
the
gills
with
hop
flavor
i
hesitated
to
review
this
because
it
had
been
in
my
fridge
for
at
least
a
couple
of
months
and
the
bottle
said
best
before
jan
2009

it
was
technically
past

fine
beer
by
all
means
imperials
are
tricky
for
me
because
everything
is
so
big
that
it
becomes
such
a
bother
albeit
a
fun
one
when
there
is
plenty
of
time
to
decipher
and
put
into
words
im
not
sure
if
the
hallertau
hops
ever
asked
for
the
spotlight
since
i
believe
that
it
is
most
comfortable
in
lagers
and
finding
a
balance
in
the
ale
category
as
the
label
states
on
the
bottom

i
assume
since

but
mr

has
proven
me
wrong
in
an
era
of
t
thicker
side
of
medium
body
almost
creamy
with
steady
carbonation
and
slight
bite
from
hops
strong
malt
background
like
the
aroma
and
toward
finish
the
hops
take
over
and
linger
well
into
the
finish
primarily
earthy
grassy

a

glbc

reminds
me
a

of
this
but
not
as
good
as
this
at
least
balance
and
body
wise
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
bold
drinkable
enough
if
you
love
hops
for
those
who
feel
ive
over
rated
this
brew
i
beg
of
you
jusdge
each
characteristic
individually
i
think
ive
justified
my
ratings
here
i
am
extremely
impressed
with
this
sam
adams
original
i
will
certainly
be
venturing
back
to
dans
liquor
in
search
of
more
i
hope
this
time
to
pick
up
a
six
pack
as
opposed
to
just
an
individual
bottle
here
i
come
dan
drinkability
surprisingly
drinkable
for
such
a
hop
filled
beer
very
drinkable
for
those
hop
lovers
very
nice
balance
between
malt
and
hops
since
it
is
too
cold
when
it
warms
to
proper
temp
i
forsee
the
hops
punching
you
in
the
nose
and
mouth
these
aint
cheap
but
sa
definately
gives
you
your
moneys
worth
with
this
brew
d
this
is
8
1
its
very
drinkable
a
couple
of
these
on
a
summer
afternoon
would
be
very
refreshing
and
probably
give
a
decent
buzz
as
well
the
hops
and
malts
are
in
excellent
balance
and
the
carbonation
is
just
right
taste
dry
and
hoppy
no
malt
just
hops
grassy
resiny
bitterness
crisp
and
very
drinkable
i
wouldnt
guess
this
was
above
5
or
6
its
been
a
long
time
since
ive
had
a
pilsner
this
good
pours
a
light
hazy
amber
with
a
massive
head
can
really
smell
the
bavarian
hops
with
haylike
undertones
taste
is
very
clean
up
front
with
the
hops
behing
mellowed
by
the
malt
the
hops
keep
it
bitter
but
without
turning
into
a
weak
ipa
a
taste
of
bread
is
also
there
throughout
giving
it
a
thick
mouthfeel
if
you
just
dont
like
it
email
me
and
ill
trade
you
for
something
you
do
like
can
only
have
1
or
2
but
i
highly
recommend
you
try
it
i
love
it
overall
this
is
a
very
interesting
beer
though
the
bitterness
alcohol
level
and
mouthfeel
make
it
a
slow
sipper
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
it
is
one
of
my
favorite
american
ipa
to
date
overall
there
are
many
a
detail
to
this
beer
that
can
be
explained
and
over
explained
the
taste
smell
and
feel
and
really
hard
to
put
into
words
this
beer
is
of
the
best
that
sam
adams
has
to
offer
dpretty
ok
drinkability
the
bitterness
seems
to
be
borderline
a
bit
much
however
that
does
seem
to
be
in
line
with
the
style
so
yea
its
a
tasty
beer
however
after
sitting
with
it
for
some
minutes
now
i
wouldnt
say
its
a
particularly
unique
beer
but
it
is
good
no
doubt
about
that
once
again
an
intense
beer
that
is
surely
not
for
amateurs
but
an
intelligent
sipping
beer
worthy
of
a
long
winter
afternoon
you
did
it
again
jim
koch
a
winner
here
from
sam
adams
will
be
seekig
this
out
again
will
buy
many
more
of
these
next
time
they
are
available
very
drinkable
beer
if
you
like
your
ipas
or
dipas
you
will
love
this
go
out
and
find
yourself
some
of
this
while
its
still
on
the
shelves
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
with
great
characteristics
the
only
problem
is
the
limited
availability
many
thanks
to
the
two
fellows
that
shared
this
d
this
one
is
definitely
a
sipper
at
8
8
and
with
the
intense
hoppiness
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
beer
is
a
murky
golden
color
with
a
huge
milky
white
head
the
smell
is
a
bouquet
of
earthy
piney
spicy
hops
the
taste
has
the
same
hoppiness
to
it
with
a
sweet
bite
of
alcohol
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
low
level
carbonation
this
beer
is
definitely
a
sipper
not
a
quaffer
very
interesting
because
usually
you
dont
get
to
experience
hallertau
like
this
generally
it
is
a
side
note
in
pilsners
nice
to
see
sa
bring
it
to
the
forefront
a
great
experience
for
hop
heads
everywhere
and
proof
thay
lager
brewers
can
go
hopping
mad
too
pours
a
cloudyhazy
orange
color
with
a
2inch
white
head
aroma
is
citrus
hops
and
grapefruit
taste
is
hoppy
not
too
hoppy
has
a
pretty
good
bite
to
it
followed
by
grapefruit
undertones
almost
has
a
slight
malty
aftertatse
as
well
good
carbonation
also
has
a
sticky
lacing
throughout
this
beer
is
not
overly
hoppy
but
it
is
approachable
and
drinkable
just
like
every
other
sam
adams
beer
out
there
i
could
easily
finish
off
the
4pk
in
one
nite
another
great
beer
from
the
bbc
bought
the
four
pack
at
spirit
haus
in
amherst
great
appearance
with
a
dull
murky
orange
thick
head
and
wonderful
lacing
on
the
side
aromas
are
moderately
strong
with
hops
spices
cloves
florals
and
bready
grains
taste
was
phenomenally
strong
really
bitter
with
a
slightly
sweet
aftertaste
heavy
on
hops
indeed
a
good
clean
crispness
aids
in
really
enhancing
the
drinks
drinkability
and
flavoring
overall
a
really
good
drink
from
sam
adams
d
very
drinkable
easy
to
forget
its
8
1abv
it
may
not
be
the
most
complex
beer
ive
had
but
it
might
be
one
of
the
most
interesting
ive
never
had
a
beer
that
seems
to
have
incapsulated
the
prefermentation
properties
of
wort
in
a
finished
beer
really
unique
and
fantastic
well
worth
the
long
search
overall
id
say
this
is
strictly
to
relieve
a
craving
for
hops
also
excitingto
have
something
totally
different
than
what
your
used
to
d
for
an
imperial
brew
that
is
this
high
in
abv
and
hop
bitterness
i
still
find
it
remarkably
drinkable
all
the
characteristics
of
this
make
it
into
a
perfect
brew
for
me
to
session
when
i
want
a
hop
fix
overall
a
nice
beer
one
of
kind
for
sure
that
said
i
couldnt
imagine
drinking
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
sitting
i
also
dont
think
the
sweetness
melds
with
the
hop
profile
very
well
i
think
less
sweetness
would
be
more
down
my
alley
ala
stones
ruination
overall
a
smack
your
momma
type
of
beer
this
beer
was
so
intensely
hoppy
that
i
could
have
literally
slapped
my
momma
d
imo
this
is
a
one
per
sitting
drinker
this
is
not
a
session
beer
but
it
is
a
really
good
beer
for
what
it
is
supposed
to
be
if
you
are
looking
for
an
intense
hoppy
pilsner
that
will
slap
you
right
in
the
face
with
taste
this
is
th
beer
for
you
this
is
truly
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
ever
had
definitely
a
benchmark
for
others
to
imitate
d
abv
cost
and
intensity
make
this
a
nice
once
in
awhile
beer
but
interesting
none
the
less
i
love
hops
but
this
beer
would
have
served
better
with
more
malt
and
more
balance
attractive
beverage
a
nice
orange
red
lots
of
fizz
a
twofinger
width
white
foam
head
the
smell
is
purely
hops
mainly
pine
hops
and
a
little
honeymalty
sweetness
thrown
in
the
taste
is
interesting
the
hops
are
burning
but
there
is
an
underlying
malt
sweetness
at
first
this
was
basically
like
hop
juice
but
i
quicly
saw
more
complexity
to
it
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
thick
and
a
little
oily
the
finish
is
a
citrusygrapefruit
hop
flavor
astringent
and
long
lasting
interesting
beer
overall
out
of
a
bottle
this
beer
was
a
cloudy
bright
orangegold
color
with
lots
of
visible
rising
carbonation
the
head
was
one
fingers
worth
of
yellow
tinted
foam
that
quickly
settled
into
a
tight
cap
and
laced
the
aroma
was
quite
hoppy
grapefruit
and
orange
peel
in
particular
and
spicy
as
well
with
a
background
of
wood
and
hints
of
peat
smoke
the
flavors
were
bold
and
as
described
on
the
bottle
an
intense
hop
experience
the
first
flavor
i
got
was
the
citric
hoppiness
and
some
bitter
elements
of
orange
and
lemon
peelzest
soon
followed
by
the
pine
note
this
was
then
tempered
by
some
earthy
malt
which
does
provide
just
enough
sweetness
to
balance
it
very
bitter
overall
as
close
to
fresh
hops
flavor
as
i
have
found
to
date
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
despite
being
full
and
rich
though
i
would
stipulate
this
beer
best
be
enjoyed
by
hopheads
it
truly
is
a
great
example
of
an
unusual
style
and
representative
of
the
act
that
despite
being
a
macro
sam
adams
can
brew
like
a
micro
d
really
fantastic
great
imperial
pilsener
wonderful
grassy
earthy
hops
i
think
i
really
enjoy
hallertau
as
a
hop
style
incredibly
drinkable
at
almost
9
abv
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
i
really
dont
care
if
this
one
has
higher
alcohol
in
it
any
pils
should
have
more
carbonatino
than
this
one
does
sure
it
has
a
bit
of
a
heavier
body
but
in
my
opinion
given
the
overall
malt
character
and
alcohol
character
this
one
should
have
more
carbonation
in
my
opinion
it
would
make
it
a
bit
easier
to
drink
its
just
that
the
alcohol
is
so
forward
perhaps
higher
abv
would
help
to
scrub
that
out
just
some
thoughts
this
is
a
beer
that
ill
gladly
finish
however
it
isnt
one
that
ill
readily
pick
up
again
the
only
reason
i
bought
it
was
becasue
ive
not
tried
it
yet
and
i
had
hoped
it
was
one
of
the
better
sam
adams
offerings
and
it
is
still
though
im
not
crazy
about
it
its
not
a
seasonal
that
ill
buy
every
year
its
not
dfh
punkin
or
schlafly
pumpkin
ale
this
one
really
doesnt
do
anything
for
me
sure
its
okay
but
its
not
pulling
me
in
not
convincing
me
to
buy
it
next
year
overall
i
was
expecting
more
hops
than
this
it
had
a
lot
but
it
says
an
intense
hop
experiance
on
it
it
was
definately
a
great
beer
and
i
was
happy
that
i
bought
it
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
likes
hops
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
to
start
my
evening
wind
down
with
ive
never
had
any
other
imperial
pilsners
before
so
i
cannot
do
a
comparison
i
really
like
hoppy
beers
so
this
one
gets
a
thumbs
up
from
me
recommended
for
those
who
like
hop
filled
bitterness
will
seek
out
again
beside
being
the
hoppiest
pilsner
ive
had
it
was
the
earthiest
grainy
aggressive
bitterness
hits
you
up
front
with
a
sweet
yeasty
slightly
citrus
middle
the
finish
is
refreshingly
dry
with
an
aftertaste
of
sweet
cereal
maybe
my
snout
is
betraying
me
but
the
nose
on
this
one
didnt
do
the
taste
justice
similar
to
a
double
ipa
heavier
than
it
appears
and
seriously
mad
hops
not
the
hopiest
brew
ive
ever
had
but
in
the
same
area
code
surprisingly
smooth
and
drinkable
but
as
mentioned
in
some
other
reviews
one
will
probably
do
the
trick
drinkability
this
guy
really
is
a
beast
and
not
one
for
inexperienced
its
real
hard
to
drink
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
sitting
its
perfect
if
youre
just
looking
for
one
beer
that
is
going
to
completely
satisfy
all
of
your
hophead
urges
mfd
a
pretty
good
example
of
this
stylebut
not
something
you
would
want
to
session
nice
creamy
mouth
feel
buy
if
you
love
hops
dont
bother
if
you
arent
a
fan
overall
probably
the
best
sam
adams
i
have
had
to
date
tons
of
flavor
and
very
comparable
to
a
great
dipa
ok
this
is
a
decent
beer
it
pours
golden
hue
with
a
thin
head
that
disappears
quickly
the
smell
is
super
hoppy
very
floral
and
strong
on
the
nose
taste
is
good
and
crisp
at
first
but
the
after
taste
is
insanely
hoppy
which
is
very
good
at
first
but
graduates
to
almost
an
annoying
bitter
i
cant
blame
this
factor
really
it
says
right
on
the
bottle
that
its
an
intense
hop
experiece
the
mouthfeel
is
actually
quite
thick
which
was
not
expected
ounique
and
enjoyable
but
not
a
beer
that
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
what
i
really
appreciated
about
this
beer
was
the
opportunity
to
blaze
the
profile
of
hallertau
permanently
in
my
mind
d
given
that
my
experience
was
a
bit
of
a
see
saw
ride
from
bad
to
good
i
dont
think
that
i
would
want
to
go
through
that
for
more
than
one
bottle
i
cant
really
tel
if
the
beer
improved
that
much
as
it
sat
or
if
it
was
a
matter
of
my
tastebuds
adjusting
to
it
the
color
was
a
cloudy
light
amber
good
lacing
but
little
retention
on
the
head
taste
was
hops
no
doubt
about
it
this
is
hoppy
a
little
bitter
and
i
didnt
care
for
the
aroma
i
couldnt
place
it
but
something
about
it
was
offputting
to
me
this
had
the
taste
of
an
ipa
but
with
a
sour
finish
not
bad
worth
trying
but
not
something
i
would
but
a
lot
of
d
decent
and
tasty
but
slightly
harsh
aftertaste
makes
me
only
want
one
more
at
most
it
loses
points
on
the
latter
quality
a
bit
too
strong
for
a
session
brew
as
after
two
i
was
ready
to
back
off
but
still
an
excellent
brew
all
around
the
first
time
i
had
this
i
remember
it
being
stronger
the
flavor
seems
to
have
changed
a
bit
very
good
stuff
i
prefer
it
fresh
though
thanks
to
skinnyelvis
for
this
halloween
08
treat
all
that
being
said
i
still
enjoy
this
beer
greatly
and
im
glad
sa
went
out
on
a
limb
to
craft
this
unique
brew
definitely
worth
a
try
but
with
a
bit
more
tinkering
this
could
be
one
for
the
ages
overall
a
very
interesting
marriage
of
what
seems
like
a
double
ipa
and
a
pilsner
nice
work
sam
adams
d
fairly
good
not
too
many
examples
of
the
style
out
there
so
it
is
always
nice
to
get
to
try
one
this
is
a
very
bitter
yet
drinkable
beer
you
should
seak
out
and
enjoy
this
beast
a
lovely
capable
beer
md
medium
bodied
and
very
smooth
on
the
lighter
side
of
carbonation
which
i
appreciate
pours
a
hazy
orange
amber
with
a
pretty
white
head
that
rises
and
falls
leaving
vertical
traces
of
head
footprints
smell
is
citrus
fresh
hints
of
peppery
tangerines
certainly
also
notes
of
lager
like
corn
white
bread
malts
taste
follows
suite
an
initial
hit
of
sweet
crystal
malt
that
definitely
reminds
me
of
fresh
baked
bread
notes
of
lemon
zest
orange
juice
peppery
spice
and
spearmint
hop
flavors
move
through
a
bit
of
a
lager
flavor
on
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
full
and
creamy
but
finishes
quite
dry
very
enjoyable
and
welcomed
every
year
i
do
not
reccommend
drinking
this
beer
unless
you
want
to
taste
a
common
offflavor
for
homebrew
troubleshooting
or
competition
judging
purposes
devery
single
time
its
out
i
buy
this
one
i
love
it
interesting
take
and
interesting
style
sam
adams
took
a
venture
on
the
wilder
side
on
this
but
comes
out
nice
it
tastes
like
a
good
ipa
with
a
much
different
aftertaste
of
flavors
drinkability
wow
i
could
quaff
liters
of
this
before
i
passed
out
and
died
of
alcohol
poisoning
tastes
great
i
dont
know
if
its
quite
worth
the
4
a
bottle
but
the
hallertau
is
a
nice
change
from
the
northwest
hops
i
am
used
to
tasting
overall
a
very
good
beer
this
is
the
first
time
ive
tried
in
imperial
pilsner
and
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
it
very
nice
stuff
drinkability
totally
a
great
sipper
really
a
meal
unto
itself
best
sit
back
with
this
puppy
and
take
teeny
tinny
sips
this
golden
orange
beer
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
left
noticeable
lacing
on
the
glass
as
i
enjoyed
it
the
aroma
was
very
similar
to
that
of
an
ipa
but
the
taste
most
definitely
was
not
the
taste
is
much
less
bitter
than
the
aroma
lets
on
but
the
aftertaste
is
very
distinct
of
hops
not
just
a
hoppy
aftertaste
but
that
of
actual
hops
like
i
just
ate
some
to
test
them
before
homebrewing
this
is
a
unique
and
firsttime
beer
experience
for
me
and
i
think
i
like
it
despite
the
high
level
of
alcohol
this
is
a
very
balanced
and
drinkable
imperial
pilsner
and
the
dry
finish
keeps
you
wanting
more
a
great
example
for
hop
lovers
everywhere
n
b
i
generally
dislike
pilsners
so
this
brew
has
overcome
quite
a
bias
to
do
this
well
if
youre
really
into
pilsners
add
a
point
to
the
taste
section
d
this
is
enjoyable
but
not
your
session
beer
i
will
gladly
drink
my
last
few
bottles
though
im
a
pretty
big
fan
of
pilsners
but
never
had
a
stab
at
the
imperial
variety
looks
and
smells
like
an
ipa
in
the
glass
not
a
bad
start
taste
is
very
hoppy
with
the
usual
ipa
tasting
notes
but
the
finish
is
much
different
it
doesnt
have
that
biting
bitterness
to
it
which
i
do
like
and
instead
has
a
sweeter
aftertaste
to
it
a
very
unique
tasting
beer
i
must
say
very
drinkable
and
great
all
around
well
done
sam
adams
overall
a
very
nice
beer
from
sam
adams
a
great
twist
to
a
classic
style
im
glad
i
have
another
11
bottles
to
enjoy
very
nice
poured
into
a
pilsner
glass
gold

nice

perfect

moderate

smell
is
a

balance
reminds
me
of
a
bells
twohearted
taste
is
a
big
hop
bite
followed
by
some
sweet
malt
notes
and
a
nice
bitter
finish
not
very
heavy
for
8
1
abv
very
dry
and
crisp
with
deadon
carbonation
this
is
really
a
great
beer
and
a
good
alternative
to
the
playedout
megahopped
pale
ales
i
wish
this
was
sold
in
six
packs
instead
of
four
because
four
doesnt
seem
to
be
enough
excellent
in
my
opinion
this
is
one
of
sam
adams
better
beers
very
well
done
di
was
skeptical
of
the
style
before
this
brew
this
gives
a
great
dose
of
those
hallertau
hops
and
really
is
a
hop
heads
dream
i
cant
say
how
surprised
i
was
at
how
much
i
liked
this
there
is
just
enough
of
a
malt
background
to
give
it
some
balance
a
very
interesting
beer
and
better
than
other
versions
of
the
style
i
have
had
this
is
much
more
onedimentional
than
odells
the
latter
takes
you
on
more
of
a
trip
sam
adams
is
more
intense
while
odells
is
more
balanced
thats
why
i
would
choose
odells
over
sams
d
i
liked
the
previous
version
better
but
this
one
is
still
on
my
list
of
seasonal
offerings
to
pick
up
i
could
put
back
several
of
these
but
not
much
more
than
that
since
the
hops
really
dominate
your
taste
buds
d
not
a
session
beer
by
any
means
but
still
a
beer
that
i
could
drink
more
than
one
in
a
night
especially
with
the
hoppy
characteristics
this
one
doesnt
burn
your
tongue
very
nice
beer
in
all
im
quite
impressed
d
this
has
got
to
be
the
most
refreshing
8
beer
ive
had
since
my
first
duvel
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
and
a
terrific
example
of
the
style
the
flavor
is
an
unconventional
hopbomb
and
one
ill
certainly
be
reaching
for
again
next
year

i

heeding
the
advice
of
the
bestby
date
echohob
this
is
my
first
hoppy
experience
and
i
have
to
say
it
wasnt
too
bad
i
had
it
in
the
bottle
it
came
in
and
already
chilled
the
first
drink
was
not
expected
and
had
a
taste
that
stuck
on
the
back
of
my
throat
until
the
next
drink
it
was
something
i
wasnt
expecting
but
enjoyed
extremely
i
had
half
the
bottle
and
transfered
the
remainder
to
a
glass
it
poured
a
thick
milky
and
golden
with
a
head
that
slowly
tapered
off
pours
a
slightly
pale
golden
color
with
extreme
head
has
a
intense
but
pleasant
hop
aroma
as
with
the
smell
the
taste
is
extremely
hoppy
with
a
tad
of
maltiness
mouthfeel
could
be
a

more
smooth
its
pretty
harsh
even
for
a

i
appreciated
the

very

im

pretty
impressed

this

poured

the

i
pick
up

pils

even
with
the
extra
ingredients
very
drinkable
and
far
from
tasting
like
a
load
very
good
job
i
was
really
looking
forward
to
trying
this
beer
poured
great
looked
great
and
the
smell
was
out
of
this
world
but
the
taste
blew
it
for
me
the
bottles
have
drink
by
january
2008
and
it
is
now
almost
april
2008
so
i
do
not
know
how
much
the
date
was
a
factor
but
this
beer
was
way
too
salty
tasting
for
me
i
tried
a
second
sip
and
then
just
poured
the
rest
the
down
the
drain
has
anyone
tasted
this
when
it
first
came
out

again

notes
something
that
3floyds

or
victorys

does
perfectly
still
a
very
good
beer
and
im
glad
to
finally
give
a
sam
adams
an
unqualified
high
rating
a
deep
golden
color
with
an
inch
and
half
white
head
that
has
excellent
retention
a
citrusy
fragrance
at
the
start
followed
by
a
roasted
barley
aroma
with
touches
of
bread
and
yeast
scents
at
th
end
the
barley
comes
out
at
first
taste
then
is
overtaken
by
an
intense
citrus
and
grassy
flavors
lasting
till
the
very
end
a
medium
bodied
feel
with
a
crisp
dry
finish
a
very
drinkable
beer
great
aroma
an
intense
flavor
and
very
smooth
clean
fell
make
this
a
must
try
beer
mostly
for
hop
heads
though
have
you
ever
eaten
a
hop
pellet
in
many
ways
drinking
this
beer
is
just
as
intense
except
taste
is
much
better
and
you
feel
less
like
an
idiot

much
more

i
was
expected
it
to
be
a

definitely
the
intense
hop
experience
that
the
label
suggested
had
to
bust
out
my
fancy

glass
for
this
bad
boy

nice

a
thick

very
nice
a
large
dose
of
hops
wanders
past
your
nose
its
an
aroma
ive
never
smelled
in
a
beer
before
it
reminds
me
a
lot
of
the
aroma
i
get
when
i
add
hops
to
a
homebrew
during
the
boil
theres
also
a
slight
undertone
of
pale
malt
they

really
well
together
flavor
starts
with
a
mellow
hoppyiness
which
transitions
to
a
slight
tart
bitterness
the
malt
body
provides
a
nice
base
that
holds
up
well
to
support
the
hoppyness
while
not
getting
too
strong
a
tad
bit
of
alcohol
is
detectable
towards
the

are
also
good

could

many
of

the

content
might
slow
me

final
note
although
some
folks
feel
that
this
is
a
bit
pricey
i
was
extremely
happy
with
the
product
i
got
for
the
money
since
its
availability
is
limited
i
would
recommend
that
any
of
you
who
enjoy
the
bitter
flavor
of
a
good
german
pilsner
go
out
and
get
some
of
this
beer

its
gone

pint
glass
pours
an
intense
amber
with
a
massive
fluffy
offwhite
head
leaving
load
of
lacing
thick

bushy
around
the
rim
the
aroma
is
intensely
hopped
as
advertised
hellertau
in
spades
its
spicy
and
juicy
and
fresh
and
lovely
with
just
enough
malty
back
there
to
retain
some
semblance
of
balance
the
taste
is
much
the
same
heaving
from
hop
flood
with
a
solid
sweet
malt
backbone
the
body
is
full
juicy
and
smooth
good
carbonation
surprisingly
warm
in
sum
youd
almost
say
this
one
is
a
little
tough
to
handle
theres
so
much
and
then
catch
yourself
for
sounding
like
a
pansy
either
way
this
one
needs
some
space
in
between
tries
but
its
worth
it
drinkability
is
decent
for
a
beer
this
size
and
hop
potency
big
kudos

drinkability
the
hops
are
so
intense
in
this
one
that
it
becomes
a
sipper
unlike
its
stylistic
brethren
however
it
still
is
a
wonderful
fantastically
crafted
beer
and
one
of
the
best
showings
of
hops
certainly
hallertau
hops
ever
brewed
dkudos
to
jim
koch
for
this
well
produced
experiment
sure
it
may
not
be
for
everybody
as
it
is
as
advertised
over
the
top
but
i
found
it
an
exciting
and
tasting
brew
one
of
the
best
smelling
beers
i
have
ever
experienced
i
dont
think
id
reach
for
this
beer
again
except
perhaps
to
satisfy
the
hardest
core
hopshead
who
might
come
to
call
highly
recommended
if
you
are
a
hop
head
otherwise
the
bitterness
will
get
you
pours
a
cloudy
golden
orangey
color
with
a
fluffy
white
head
that
just
wouldnt
quit
carbonation
on
this
one
is
a
bit
on
the
high
side
smell
is
overwhelming
hops
but
not
the
spicy
or
citrusy
smell
that
one
would
expect
from
an
ipa
with
c
hops
in
it
definitely
a
much
more
flower
like
smell
the
taste
didnt
really
do
it
for
me
very
bitter
as
one
would
expect
although
it
seems
that
there
is
little
anyway
great
hop
aroma
off
the
bat
nothing
to
acidic
or
overpowering
but
the
smell
goes
al
the
way
into
the
back
of
your
nose
smells
like
pine
needles
in
lemonade
i
expected
a
harsher
taste
definitely
finishes
bitter
the
harsh
bitterness
kills
the
drinkability
for
me
a
hopped
up
brew
that
is
quite
different
than
its
nw
u
s
cousin
more
on
the
spicy
side
which
i
believe
leads
to
the
harsh
bitterness

of

and
its

time
d
im
not
a
big
fan
of
really
hoppy
beers
but
this
is
really
drinkable
it
is
smooth
and
the
hops
that
normally
bother
me
are
really
subtle
until
the
finish
where
they
are
great
well
one
problem
being
the
beer
geek
i
am
sam
adams
labels
there
beer
in
the
bottom
right
of
the
label
with
the
type
of
beer
ale
or
lager
well
a
pilsner
is
a
lager
by
def
but
sammy
puts
ale
on
it
am
i
the
only
one
who
noticed
yeah
i
scratchd
my
head
too
for
pilsner
damn
good
but
its
not
a
pilsner
by
yeast
type
ale
and
flavor
it
is
an
i
p
a
i
wish
they
would
change
that
thats
my
rant
for
the
day
s
samuel
adams
hallertau
imperial
pilsner
pours
a
hazy
orange
with
a
white
head
from
a
brown
twelve
ounce
bottle
the
aroma
is
citrusy
hops
the
flavor
has
some
bite
to
it
citrusy
hops
are
the
stand
out
but
there
is
a
solid
malt
bill
that
balances
it
quite
nicely
i
think
you
can
taste
the
alcohol
a
bit
and
it
provides
part
of
the
bite
i
like
this
better
than
others
ive
had
in
this
style
definitely
worth
a
try
especially
if
you
like
imperial
pils
pours
a
hazy
orange
with
an
off
white
head
looks
like
a
double
ipa
smells
of
earthy
hops
taste
is
sweet
and
malty
with
a
grapefruity
piney
hop
texture
mouthfeel
is
rich
and
full
pretty
drinkable
despite
the
8
8
percent
alcohol
i
drank
the
beer
at
around
60
degrees
fahrenheit
and
at
this
temperature
it
tastes
a
lot
like
a
double
ipa
pours
a
hazy
golden
orange
amber
color
with
a
huge
egg
shell
colored
head
that
resists
fading
a
good
amount
of
lacing
generated
the
smell
is
certainly
more
of
a
citrus
hop
than
a
typical
pilsner
has
the
heavy
sweet
malt
aroma
of
a
double
ipa
adequately
carbonated
the
mouth
feel
is
heavy
and
sweet
full
flavored
it
really
does
seem
like
a
celebration
of
the
hops
the
mouth
smell
and
flavor
really
complement
each
other
easy
drinker
the
8
8
abv
is
well
integrated
into
this
one
like
all
of
the
double
pilsners
you
really
do
loose
the
crisp
clean
texture
they
are
much
sweeter
than
a
standard
pilsner
highly
recommended
drinkability
amazing
this
is
like
liquid
hops
but
not
too
extreme
not
too
sweet
and
it
doesnt
land
like
a
lupulic
firebomb
on
the
palate
its
just
pure
flavorful
hops
drinkable
shit
yeah
the
three
4packs
were
not
nearly
enough
i
should
have
bought
a
case
i
wish
nebraska
had
received
more
than
a
half
pallet
anyway
this
is
a
world
class
beer
it
is
a
must
try
honestly
i
might
be
understating
how
terrific
this
beer
is
what
a
joyous
quaff
a
bit
thin
on
the
tongue
warming
is
the
alcohol
quite
bitter
lower
drinkablily
due
to
the
abv
and
over
the
top
bitterness
i
think
sa
could
have
done
a
little
better
but
this
was
no
slouch
a
sixer
would
be
too
much
for
me
this
one
single
was
all
i
needed
notes
this
is
good
stuff
its
extremely
hoppy
more
so
than
even
most
double
ipas
out
there
but
its
fairly
wellbalanced
and
it
has
great
hop
character
sams
imperial
pilsner
is
good
for
a
hopfix
in
a
pinch
but
hop
wallop
and
double
dog
do
this
sort
of
thing
better
still
its
an
interesting
beer
and
if
you
like
hallertau
hops
one
to
try
an
intense
hop
experience
yeah
but
nothing
that
id
seek
out
for
more
smooth
and
enjoyable

had
been
waiting
a
long
time
for
this
to
come
around
thankfully
we
are
now
carrying
it
in
our
local
stores
i
was
definitely
in
the
mood
for
an
intense
hop
experience
so
it
pours
a
great
looking
amber
with
a
nice
hazy
and
cloudiness
about
it
lots
of
carbonation
coming
off
the
bottom
of
the
glass
made
it
very
apparent
this
was
a
lively
one
a
great
three
inches
or
more
of
sticky
lace
formed
on
the
top
and
took
its
sweet
old
time
in
settling
down
finally
after
several
minutes
it
went
down
to
a
nice
layer
about
a
half
inch
thick
with
ample
side
glass
lace
around
it
smell
was
deep
floral
hops
with
a
more
then
evident
malty
and
grain
back
nice
pine
aroma
blended
in
very
well
with
a
touch
of
sweetness
the
flavor
was
more
akin
to
a
big
ipa
then
a
pilsner
a
very
full
flavor
it
had
a
lot
of
the
appeal
of
an
iipa
and
this
made
it
go
down
very
smooth
a
nice
crisp
flavor
blended
in
with
the
smooth
mouth
feel
lots
of
bitter
floral
hops
dominated
this
but
there
was
also
nice
underlying
musky
bread
like
grain
that
made
up
the
backbone
of
it
overall
this
was
a
fantastic
brew
i
would
dare
to
say
that
that
this
is
an
excellent
creation
from
sam
adams
and
the
best
i
have
seen
come
out
of
them
it
had
superb
drinkabilty
and
a
light
body
but
intense
flavor
definitely
worthy
of
a
spot
in
the

the

imperial

resiny
hop
with
a
touch
of

sweetness
as
well
and
a

almost
heavy

hops
on
the

wich
is
just
great
with

very
leafy

a

as
well
with
some

sweetness

the

bringing
up

it
doesnt

the

my
only
comment
is
that
it
seems
more
like
a
double
ipa
than
a
double
pilsner
there
usually
isnt
much
citrus
flavor
in
pilsners
and
this
has
plenty
of
citrus
but
who
cares

a

lackenhausersep

resulting
in
a
finish
that
is
also
dominated
by
hop
bitterness
and
aroma
i
suppose
it
is
nice
to
have
a
beer
that
goes
overboard
on
those
hops
to
make
them
easier
for
me
to
distinguish
in
lesser
beers
the
hops
arent
quite
piney
which
makes
sense
given
the
high
gravity
on
this
beer
if
it
werent
quite
as
strong
i
kind
of
would
have
preferred
this
to
be
lower
on
the
abv
scale
it
does
something
to
the
overall
flavor
slight
so
slightly
hinders
drinkability

but
citrusy
too
i
work
for
leon
farmer
and
distribute
southern
tier
it
is
a
decent
seasonal
beer
about
to
return
to
the
theatre
i
decided
to
revisit
the
krampus
see
how
it
comes
across
these
days
it
pours
a
clear
sunset
amberbrass
topped
by
a
finger
of
lightly
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
melon
apricot
caramel
light
sweet
cereal
grains
and
a
twinge
of
booze
for
good
measure
the
taste
holds
notes
of
boozy
grass
sweet
cereal
light
vinyl
and
mild
corn
syrup
the
body
is
a
stolid
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
fluid
feel
overall
not
terrible
but
the
booziness
and
slightlyfruity
sweetness
clash
and
create
something
akin
to
higherend
malt
liquors
still
not
my
cup
o
tea
really
pours
a
deep
golden
color
clear
with
average
to
slightly
less
average
head
and
commendable
lacing
all
around
aroma
is
both
hoppy
and
malty
first
taste
is
very
bitter
hops
and
then
a
little
sweetness
this
beer
may
be
out
of
date
as
the
flavors
are
weak
and
somewhat
watered
down
the
bitterness
is
not
that
pleasant
and
lingers
and
lingers
and
lingers
overall
the
flavors
are
there
but
they
wont
go
together
kind
of
like
oil
and
vinegar
will
have
to
check
date
and
if
it
is
an
old
bottle
will
revisit
in
the
future
awesome
label
with
a
killer
depiction
of

another
super
solid
offering
from
st
a
nice
change

for
a

ive
had
other
hoppy

this
is
the
best
ive
had
aged
for
over
a
year
never
have
had
a
fresh
one
so
no
baseline
to
compare
it
to
its
got
a
nice
euroholiday
beer
vibe
with
a
little
more
spice
nice
beer
didnt
remind
me
of
helles
in
color
or
style
seemed
more
an
ale
and
just
another
iipa
4
5
in
looks
because
i
like
the
haziness
ymmv
first
off
let
me
just
start
off
by
saying
that
ipas
are
really
not
my
thing
now
this
tasted
a
lot
like
an
ipa
to
me
so
much
so
that
if
you
put
like
5
different
ipas
in
front
of
me
threw
this
in
the
mix
i
probably
wouldnt
be
able
to
pick
it
out
from
the
others
if
you
like
ipas
youd
probably
enjoy
this
but
its
a
bit
too
piney
for
my
liking
i
was
a
little
taken
back
by
the
taste
it
is
very
hoppy
and
bitter
much
more
like
an
ipa
than
a
lager
it
is
a
good
beer
that
has
a
ton
of
smell
and
taste
i
think
it
is
a
little
too
piney
for
my
liking
but
a
good
beer
to
try
o
a
piney
hop
showcase
that
keeps
the
crispness
of
a
lager
22
oz
bottle
enjoyed
with
family
the
day
after
christmas
o
this
is
a
great
beer
with
plenty
of
delicious
hop
flavors
and
a
decent
malt
backbone
grab
this
and
enjoy
if
hoppy
beers
are
your
thing
overall
a
very
good
hopped
up
spin
on
an
imperial
helles
lager
starts
very
hop
forward
but
the
lager
element
isnt
lost
this
beer
was
poured
from
a
22oz
bottle
into
a
blind
pig
mug
and
enjoyed
at
apx
55f
too
hoppy
and
piney
for
my
taste
not
much
in
the
way
of
smell
fresh
clean
and
malty
bright
sweetness
on
the
palate
with
mediumhigh
carbonation
big
grapefruit
orange
apple
hop
flavors
that
linger
and
mix
with
a
pleasing
and
drying
bitterness
a
very
good
beer
to
higher
bitterness
level
than
normal
helles
but
not
overpowering
and
pairs
well
with
slight
alcohol
warmth
bright
pine
hops
grass
malt
and
bready
malt
quality
lots
of
citrus
fruit
grapefruit
lime
zest
tangerine
i
like
the
label
name
and
overall
uniqueness
of
having
a
winter
lager
seasonal
and
it
nails
all
those
plus
tastes
like
a
real
beer
drink
cold
as
it
is
very
uneven
as
it
warms
it
seems
a
bit
like
a
doppelbock
though
this
might
not
be
fresh
hard
to
tell
once
this
was
bought
in
the
us
again
im
getting
to
much
bitterness
for
my
taste
but
it
is
fresh
and
crisp
its
a
good
beer
not
just
what
i
would
go
to
on
a
daily
basis
but
its
seasonal
so
dont
forget
to
ask
santa
very

a
one

when
poured

classy
smell
of

on
the
nose
nice
flavor
will
revisit
this
beer
super
juicy
and
fruity
with
a
nice
bitter
finish
this
tastes
much
more
like
a
fine
creamy
ipa
then
any
type
of
lager
ive
had
but
its
really
awesome
low
c
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
pretty
nice
beer
and
i
thought
it
was
a
good
example
of
a
imperial
version
of
a
helles
lager
it
had
pretty
much
all
the
aspects
that
i
would
expect
from
a
helles
lager
but
they
were
all
much
bigger
which
was
nice
and
it
still
kept
a
little
bit
of
that
good
drinkability
that
the
style
is
know
for
with
some
nicely
hidden
alcohol
this
beer
had
nice
drinkability
it
was
fairly
smooth
just
a
little
crisp
alcohol
was
well
hidden
a
little
creamy
not
too
filling
and
the
taste
did
a
decent
job
at
holding
my
attention
i
think
one
glass
is
the
perfect
amount
for
me
but
the
since
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
i
dont
think
ill
have
a
problem
drinking
a
bomber
to
myself
what
i
liked
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
appearance
and
aroma
they
were
both
good
and
they
worked
well
with
this
beer
and
i
also
really
liked
how
well
the
alcohol
was
hidden
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
that
the
taste
wasnt
as
balanced
as
the
aroma
i
wish
more
of
those
malty
aspects
came
through
in
the
taste
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
but
i
will
probably
wait
till
its
released
next
year
and
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
thinks
a
imperial
helles
lager
sounds
interesting
all
in
all
i
was
happy
with
this
beer
i
wasnt
wowed
with
it
but
it
does
good
job
of
keeping
most
of
the
aspects
that
helles
lager
has
and
just
making
it
bigger
and
bolder
it
isnt
my
favorite
southern
tier
beer
but
it
is
one
of
the
better
of
the
style
that
ive
had
and
im
lumping
ti
together
with
imperial
pilseners
because
thats
what
ba
has
it
as
and
i
find
it
to
be
very
similar
to
that
style
nice
job
guys
this
was
a
tasty
keep
up
the
solid
work
pours
a
dark
yellow
with
a
light
head
that
trails
the
glass
the
smell
is
full
of
hop
bite
in
the
beginning
with
a
bit
of
a
grapefruit
scent
but
also
fresh
bread
comes
through
the
taste
was
very
pleasant
with
a
zesty
bite
in
the
beginning
and
then
mellowing
out
into
a
very
drinkable
beer
with
the
pilsner
malts
coming
through
in
the
finish
a
nice
beer
to
have
in
the
winter
22oz

amber
color
with
a
14
inch
of
head
lots

the
aroma
is
lots
of
piney
and
floral
hops
the
taste
is
a
perfect
mix
for
xmas
piney
hops
flowery
hops
as
well
a
bit
earthy
at
times
with
some
more
floral
notes
towards
the
end
light
amount
of
malt
flavor
bitter

finish
slightly
sour
somewhat

overall
a

i
always
look

to
when
winter
rolls
around
i
recommend
trying
it
as
this
is
a
great
ipalager
just
not
my
favorite
i
like
it
and
would
recommend
it
is
among
my
favorite
southern
tier
selections
o
this
is
the
best
beer
ive
had
from
southern
tier
very
glad
i
picked
it
up
the
hops
are
both
bitter
and
spicy
giving
it
a
flavor
fitting
for
the
holidays
its
fairly
complex
and
with
a
high
abv
ill
definitely
be
picking
this
up
again
the
rest
a
great
slow
sipping
beer
a
slight
medicinal
note
is
the
only
real
knock
against
this
one
otherwise
it
hides
its
9
pretty
well
o
really
enjoyed
this
festive
helles
lager
smooth
sweet
slightly
robust
would
drink
again
great
label
art
o
somewhere
between
a
pilsener
and
an
ipa
imperial
strength
quite
a
nice
drink
very
enjoyable
and
as
other
reviewers
have
noted
the
high
abv
is
wellhidden
this
is
a
nice
treat
and
you
really
should
try
it
o
never
had
an
imperial
helles
before
but
i
really
enjoyed
this
excellent
drinkability
in
my
opinion
maybe
krampus
can
pay
my
kids
a
little
visit
and
tell
them
to
knock
off
the
bullshit
when
dads
trying
to
watch
football
happy
holidays
o
i
had
this
last
year
in
bottle
and
really
enjoyed
it
that
i
looked
forward
to
it
this
year
i
had
actually
forgotten
it
was
a
lager
i
had
a
little
trouble
placing
some
flavors
as
it
seemed
to
change
slightly
with
each
taste
i
will
look
forward
to
this
each
year
as
a
slight
alternative
to
the
winter
ales
a
lager

a
little
bite

up
to

very
hop
forward
yet
not

um
well
this
is
odd

lists
this
as
an

st
says
this
is
a

deep

krampus
smells
of
toffee
some
wheat
bread
malts
and
a
touch

is
waters
not
sure
what
to
think
but
i
cant
finish
this
it
reminds
be
of
a
watered
down
lager
with
some
added
sweetness
southern
tier
misses
on
this
one
i
bought
this
because
an
imperial
helles
sounded
like
the
exact
opposite
of
all
the
winter
ales
ive
been
punishing
myself
with
lately
this
was
not
as
refreshing
as
i
was
hoping
im
not
sure
where
they
get
helles
on
here
its
interesting
but
not
my
thing
really
o
unique
style
with
what
seems
to
be
an
accurate
representation
i
love
helles
lager
and
this
truly
is
an
imperial
a
great
sipper
with
massive
lager
qualities
and
flavor
well
done
really
interesting
style
and
flavors
the
contrast
is
a
little
harsh
for
me
personally
but
great
to
try
atmosphere
is
really
nice
solid
lasting
head
continual
effervescence
and
thick
persistent
lacing
roasty
with
nut
and
bitter
components
pungent
and
bitter
flavor
components
but
the
high
alcohol
characteristic
seems
to
offer
up
a
slightly
sweet
component
for
balance
overall
this
is
a
really
good
quaff
o
i
give
southern
tier
credit
for
creating
this
unique
brew
it
really
does
taste
like
an
imperial
helles
lots
of
great
malt
flavor
and
a
good
amount
of
hoppy
bitterness
its
unique
as
most
hoppy
beers
ive
tried
give
off
at
least
a
bit
of
fruitiness
i
didnt
get
any
from
this
i
do
love
fruity
hops
but
this
is
a
nice
change
highly
recommended
this
is
great
first
its
beautiful
in
color
its
a
darker
copper
and
excellently
clear
second
the
smell
is
excellent
with
the
citrus
biscuits
then
the
taste
mirrors
quite
well
the
smell
it
is
certainly
a
hop
and
malt
delight
it
has
an
oily
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
which
you
only
want
more
of
i
would
get
this
again
this
finishes
with
not
only
a
hop
bitter
but
a
metallic
aftertaste
and
a
sour
off
flavor
it
also
finishes
slick
and
with
some
hop
oil
as
this
drinks
it
becomes
more
pleasant
lemon
takes
over
in
the
finish
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
its
an
interesting
style
to
imperialize
but
its
def
pulled
off
here
i
wish
this
was
year
round
but
ill
drink
it
up
while
i
can
each
winter
overall
this
is
a
hoppy
beer
when
fresh
that
mellows
out
nicely
a
real
nice
example
of
a
properly
done
imperial
lager
hops
add
some
great
bitterness
despite
this
remaining
a
malt
forward
beer
this
is
good
i
like
the
spicy
flavors
in
the
finish
the
finish
is
also
a
big
dry
and
continues
to
dry
as
i
sit
here
and
swallow
oh
and
i
like
the
label
the
little
guy
is
crazy
scary
not
sure
what
bottle
is
up
next
but
we
have
two
more
coming
cheers
see
i
told
you
i
was
going
say
this
more
often
imperial
helles
isnt
that
an
oxymoron
in
any
case
krampus
appears
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
nice
cap
of
foam
which
clings
to
glass
as
the
liquid
interface
falls
the
aroma
is
a
nice
balance
of
caramel
and
lemony
hops
the
alcohol
opens
the
senses
surprisingly
carbonated
almost
prickly
on
the
palate
the
malt
notes
bread
biscuit
and
dark
fruit
are
briskly
swept
away
as
the
hops
takes
over
resinous
pine
grapefruit
old
fashion
bitterness
and
a
wave
of
booze
finish
this
off
in
a
big
dollop
of
hops
a
nice
brew
that
invites
the
drinker
to
have
more
i
dont
know
if
i
would
call
this
a
helles
but
it
is
good
this
pours
a
hazy
dark
amber
color
with
an
average
beige
head
the
aroma
is
a
mixture
of
sweet
malts
hops
and
some
citrus
the
taste
is
sweet
slightly
fruity
and
pleasant
there
is
a
slight
bitter
finish
i
agree
with
the
people
that
say
this
is
more
of
a
pale
aleipa
than
a
pilsner
certainly
unique
cant
say
ive
had
anything
quite
like
it
i
wouldnt
get
this
again
perhaps
this
beer
has
been
sitting
around
and
i
think
thats
the
case
so
i
should
really
hold
off
till
i
can
confirm
a
fresh
or
somewhat
fresh
brew
overall
i
liked
it
it
matched
the
name
and
story
behind
the
beer
as
this
is
all
about
what
santa
isnt
going
to
sleep
well
tonight
one
of
the
only
holiday
brews
ive
thoroughly
enjoyed
st
didnt
overdo
the
holiday
spice
and
brought
the
hops
what
else
can
i
ask
for
poured
into
a
13

cloudy
orange
with
a
sticky

that
clings
to
the

smell
is
grapefruit
hard
candy
tangerine
and
plum
taste
is
very
similar
to
the
noise
lots
grapefruit
and
hard
candy
not
complaining
body
is
medium
plenty
of
life
a
little
dry
and
very
drinkable
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
from
this
because
of
the
style
i
liked
it
a
lot
different
frommost
beers
this
time
of
year
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
and
one
of
the
better
ones
i
have
had
from
southern
tier
it
seems
as
though
it
is
very
well
balanced
but
yet
is
still
super
bitter
and
hop
forward
i
dont
mind
that
at
all
i
also
like
that
it
isnt
some
spiced
up
charred
coffee
table
in
a
bottle
kudos
though
i
wouldnt
mind
if
this
beer
was
not
an
imperial
i
think
it
would
be
really
killer
being
brought
down
to
its
standard
self
22
ounce
bottle
into

glass
bottled
on

pours
lightly
hazy
copper
amber
color
with
a
nice
2

off
white
head
with
great
retention
that
reduces
to
a
nice

that
lasts
spotty
soapy

down

a
good
amount
of
streaming

aromas
of

is
extremely
well
hidden
with
only
a
small
warming
noticed
after
the
finish
this
is
dangerously
drinkable
overall
this
is
a
highly
excellent
imperial
helles
style
great
malt
and
hop
flavor
balance
and
robustness
very
smooth
to
sip
on
a
highly
enjoyable
offering
o
lots
of
hop
flavor
dominates
this
beer
and
gives
it
a
krampus
bite
the
malt
is
lost
quickly
in
the
never
ending
hop
finish
in
fact
the
beer
could
use
a
bit
more
balance
even
if
it
is
labeled
an
imperial
southern
tier
krampus
imperial
helles
lager
35
overall
i
find
that
the
beer
is
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
not
sure
what
the
abv
on
this
is
but
id
have
to
guess
that
its
closer
to
8
the
remarkable
thing
is
that
the
alcohol
doesnt
show
up
in
the
aroma
no
phenols
that
i
can
identify
very
good
overall
i
really
liked
this
it
was
a
nice
beer
for
christmas
eve
and
i
would
buy
it
again
again
theres
a
flavor
here
i
cant
really
seem
to
describe
but
its
different
and
i
enjoyed
it
o
a
pretty
unique
offering
especially
for
the
holidays
good
mix
of
traditional
lager
flavors
with
a
great
hop
punch
and
well
hidden
abv
overall
not
a
bad
beer
i
really
thought
i
wasnt
going
to
enjoy
it
from
the
smell
but
it
turned
out
to
taste
much
better
than
it
smelled
its
just
not
a
good
beer
though
i
feel
like
nothing
really
blends
well
with
this
and
is
a
bit
bland
in
the
beginning
of
the
taste
i
am
likely
not
to
buy
this
again
overall
great
beer
that
would
be
nice
on
a
cold
night
with
a
slice
of
warm
buttery
bread
this
sets
the
standard
for
lagers
overall
this
in
the
end
is
a
vienna
lager
on
roids
hearty
and
ridiculously
full
of
flavor
its
not
one
of
those
complex
brews
because
it
comes
at
you
straight
forward
it
is
what
is
is
really
good
beer
salud
overall
another
beer
im
glad
i
picked
up
to
give
a
full
review
i
forgot
how
good
it
was
its
a
great
hoppy
strong
lager
and
i
also
enjoy
the
fact
that
they
didnt
feel
the
need
to
call
it
india
something
just
because
its
wellhopped
another
great
beer
from
st
krampus
has
a
deep
sweet
caramel
honey
and
molasseslike
character
to
it
its
bitter
but
only
enough
to
take
some
of
that
sweetness
away
this
beer
is
pretty
sweet
having
said
that
its
almost
cloyingly
sweet
it
is
beyond
fullbodied
its
sticky
smooth
has
low
carbonation
and
dangerously
easy
to
drink
o

a

notes
poured
into
a
nostradamus
flute
glass
pours
a
medium
orange
amber
one
finger
head
and
nice
lacing
an
attractive
pour
aroma
of
strong
hops
and
citrus
nice
rich
malts
and
hops
combination
citrus
and
pine
start
and
middle
are
phenomenal
but
somewhat
dry
and
astringent
in
the
hop
finish
points
off
for
the
astringency
this
a
refrigerated
one
year
old
bottle
but
still
tastes
good
will
update
after
drinking
a
fresher
one
overall
it
was
a
tasty
brew
but
nothing
that
was
really
worth
going
out
of
the
way
for
i
get
nostalgic
drinking
beers
like
this
i
saved
this
one
from
christmas
11
poured
into
a
halfliter
pokal
its
a
gorgeous
amber
color
with
a
big
ole
ecru
colored
head
that
sticks
all
over
the
place
big
hop
smell
fantastic
caramelhoney
alcohol
esters
invite
you
into
a
nice
warming
brew
thats
not
so
boozy
but
it
lets
you
know
its
a
strong
one
not
what
i
expected
with
helles
on
the
label
but
certainly
satisfying
extremely
clear
deep
orange
pour
with
about
half
inch
of
head
that
remained
throughout
the
whole
glass
smells
of
rich
grains
yeast
bready
tastes
bitter
up
front
with
a
sweet
backbone
of
caramelbrown
sugar
tastes
of
pilsner
and
wheat
malts
refreshing
crisp
medium
bodied
but
has
the
refreshing
sensation
of
a
light
bodied
beer
this
is
perfect
for
the
style
of
beer
that
it
is
i
generally
dont
like
lagerspilsners
but
this
one
changes
the
game
give
it
a
shot
o
pretty
good
not
something
i
would
go
seek
out
but
for
an
imperial
pilsner
it
is
good
d
this
is
a
big
lager
i
would
actually
recommend
splitting
this
bottle
between
friends
overall
i
would
say
this
drinks
closer
to
an
american
strong
minus
an
intense
hop
character
than
an
imperial
helles
but
i
still
respect
the
effort
overall
this
is
a
pretty
decent
offering
considering
the
difficulty
in
producing
beers
of
this
nature
and
making
them
approachable
on
the
other
hand
it
makes
for
a
treat
during
bock
season
which
this
brew
so
closely
resembles
recommended
id
say
its
overwhelmingly
ok
overall
the
aroma
is
excellent
the
boozy
flavor
is
a
little
much
but
it
mellows
out
as
you
drink
it
medium
texture
in
the
mouthfeel
and
just
an
interesting
combination
of
ingredients
overall
that
i
like
fairly
well
if
you
like
something
a
little
different
give
it
i
try
good
beer
but
i
expected
a
bit
more
from
southern
tier
o
i
want
to
preface
this
saying
that
im
not
a
big
lager
drinker
overall
the
beer
was
just
slightly
above
average
to
me
this
just
being
that
is
probably
one
of
the
better
lagers
ive
tried
overall
i
dont
have
a
whole
lot
of
experience
with
or
knowledge
of
this
style
but
i
do
know
that
i
enjoyed
the
beer
i
went
into
it
with
an
open
mind
and
a
clean
palate
while
not
an
exceptional
beer
i
do
feel
like
it
is
a
solid
beer
and
i
feel
like
this
would
be
a
good
beer
to
drink
in
a
liter
mug
overallnot
a
bad
beer
i
have
not
had
a
lager
in
a
long
time
when
i
tasted
this
however
i
would
try
this
again
it
is
good
for
what
it
is
which
would
be
one
of
the
better
lagers
i
have
had
o
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
and
certainly
a
unique
one
but
not
one
i
will
likely
buy
again
well
i
may
wait
til
next
years
release
overall
while
i
liked
the
hop
flavors
in
here
i
thought
they
overpowered
the
brew
making
the
malts
difficult
to
locate
the
beer
as
a
whole
feels
unbalanced
because
of
this
and
the
lemony
hops
combine
with
the
floury
baguette
flavors
to
give
the
beer
a
lemonlime
soda
undertone
that
seemed
strange
the
brew
isnt
bad
of
course
and
hopheads
will
find
it
lovely
but
i
thought
a
few
more
sugars
and
a
better
caramelvanilla
base
would
have
helped
o
meh
dont
hate
it
but
wont
buy
it
again
o
its
an
all
around
good
beer
but
i
dont
know
if
it
is
so
good
as
to
merit
its
price
tag
theres
a
hint
of
a
floral
taste
which
quickly
gives
way
to
the
malty
backbone
afterwards
a
bitter
taste
sticks
around
leaving
me
wanting
more
o
good
beer
not
really
to
style
but
enjoyable
overall
its
a
solid
beer
very
fun
story
to
be
paired
with
a
frankenstein
style
it
has
some
really
great
qualities
i
was
just
left
wanting
it
to
be
a
little
bit
more
than
it
is
im
wondering
if
i
had
picked
up
this
bottle
at
the
beginning
of
the
holiday
season
as
opposed
to
the
end
if
it
would
have
had
those
qualities
im
looking
for
i
think
ill
grab
one
next
year
as
soon
as
possible
and
see
what
i
think
then
overall
interesting
beer
but
nothing
that
makes
me
desire
or
want
to
have
this
again
very
interesting
enjoyable
sipper
o
kind
of
like
a
very
hoppy
lager
dont
know
if
its
the
hop
profile
of
this
beer
or
if
it
just
doesnt
go
with
lagers
but
this
one
isnt
for
me
not
totally
bad
o
a
pretty
damn
good
beer
overall
and
very
enjoyable
if
i
didnt
know
better
id
put
this
squarely
in
the
american
ipa
category
i
suspect
this
bottle
has
been
sitting
on
the
shelf
since
last
year
so
i
may
have
to
certify
a
fresh
bottle
and
try
again
o
i
was
surprised
by
this
as
i
did
not
know
what
to
expect
but
its
damn
fine
really
balanced
flavors
and
creamy
smooth
great
drinker
in
the
end
its
pretty
average
to
me
honestly
the
bitterness
ruled
the
day
a
bit
much
here
and
was
sometimes
too
astringent
for
me
overall
impression
a
very
different
brew
from
southern
tier
cant
put
my
finger
on
the
style
but
definitely
not
a
2x
pilsner
has
too
much
hop
and
spice
for
this
i
bought
this
brew
bc
of
the
krampus
on
the
front
and
just
like
the
christmas
character
this
one
was
very
strong
and
wild
would
recommend
trying
somewhat
forgotten
about
compared
to
southern
tiers
other
big
beers
this
feels
much
more
complex
and
drinkable
than
most
of
its
brethren
it
maintains
its
lager
backbone
while
delivering
a
a
strange
but
intriguing
earthycentric
hop
profile
a
cool
unique
beer
i
try
to
get
this
every
winter
o
a
slightly
confused
lager
didnt
really
like
the
hop
profile
in
this
otherwise
great
beer
thanks
rob
for
the
christmas
present
pour
is
deep
gold
with
a
finger
of
tight
foam
that
recedes
slowly
and
leaves
lots
of
lacing
striking
appearance
with
definite
bonus
points
for
the
bottle
label
and
story
about
krampus

overall
one
of
the
most
unique
styles
ive
seen
like
i
said
almost
an
imperial
ipa
and
me
being
a
hop
head
this
one
is
truely
worth
a
try
my
heart
leapt
when
i
saw
a
southern
tier
offering
at
christmastime
named
after
the
krampus
fest
however
such
joyous
anticipation
soon
became
confusion
as
my
expectations
of
a
heavier
christmasstylewinter
ale
were
challenged
the
pour
was
brighter
than
expected
an
orangeylight
glow
to
yellow
with
a

fizzy
white
head
and
trace
lacing
clean
smooth
and
light

nice
summery
lager
drinkable
maybe
a
prank
on
us
by
krampus
pours
an
orangishbrown
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
grapefruit
with
some
other
citrus
and
a
little
bit
of
malt
the
flavor
is
grapefruit
hops
with
medium
to
high
bitterness
medium
to
high
carbonation
and
a
medium
mouthfeel
d
a
22
oz
bottle
was
enough
for
me
the
9
abv
was
too
noticeable
a
great
nose
well
balanced
flavors
and
a
strong
finish
another
solid
brew
from
southern
tier
a
very
good
drinking
beer
drinkability
this
is
not
like
other
tamer
lagers
but
is
interesting
i
like
the
sa
hallertau
more
in
this
style
which
id
like
to
try
more
of
the
better
ones
worth
your
effort
here
though
if
hoppy
imperial
pilseners
are
your
thing
then
this
is
worth
trying
id
rather
have
a
glass
of
humulus
lager
aroma
is
thick
and
sweet
with
plenty
of
floral
hop
aroma
flavor
is
very
reminiscent
of
a
dipa
but
a
little
cleaner
hop
flavor
is
bold
and
balanced
with
a
strong
malt
sweetness
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
syrupy
but
dries
up
nicely
as
drinkable
as
any
dipa
the
mouth
is
moderately
crisp
but
the
alcohol
slicks
this
one
up
a
bit
very
boozy
in
the
flavor
lots
of
ethanol
bitter
with
lots
of
hop
presence
finish
is
slightly
boozy
as
well
i
normally
like
this
style
but
as
ive
said
with
others
im
not
sure
this
style
needs
to
be
imperialized
drinkability
very
enjoyable
beer
but
one
is
plenty
overall
i
find
this
to
be
an
excellent
beer
and
a
strong
effort
from
southern
tier
recommended
overall
has
a
strong
character
very
fitting
of
the
christmas
motif
wish
it
was
available
all
the
time
get
it
if
you
can
md
smooth
and
satisfying
crisp
and
not
too
heavy
i
wish
i
had
more
overall
more
of
an
ipa
than
a
helles
an
awesome
beer
it
may
not
be
christmas
anymore
but
this
a
great
beer
for
a
cold
night
its
20
degrees
out
here
in
nj
d
if
you
like
chinook
its
fairly
drinkable
for
its
weight
i
will
drink
this
one
again
next
christmas
season
i
poured
this
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
45
degrees
the
beer
was
a
amber
color
that
had
a
big
caramel
smell
the
beer
was
a
little
bitter
but
really
what
stood
out
was
the
hot
alcohol
after
burn
it
just
blew
any
taste
away
the
beer
had
decent
lacing
but
whoop
di
doo
i
will
not
buy
again
cool
label
the
taste
is
quite
pungent
the
consistency
is
quite
medium
bodied
a
tad
syrupy
the
beer
is
loaded
with
leafy
hops
and
plenty
of
minty
hops
as
well
the
beer
has
been
dry
hopped
and
has
the
aroma
and
the
overall
hop
presence
that
is
quite
capacious
in
character
the
bready
caramel
flavors
underneath
balance
well
the
beer
has
some
warming
alcohol
notes
that
play
off
nicely
with
the
leafy
bitterness
and
the
minty
hop
aromas
there
is
a
definite
sweetness
to
the
beer
from
the
caramels
and
this
is
well
balanced
against
the
prodigious
bittering
hop
flavors
the
aftertaste
does
not
have
any
throatiness
despite
the
high
abv
this
is
a
nice
beer
well
worth
seeking
out
it
has
a
full
palate
of
flavors
lots
of
bittering
hops
lots
of
malty
character
and
plenty
of
warming
abv
lchaim
d
refreshing
and
with
a
slightly
higher
abv
it
still
is
drinkable
this
beer
poured
a
copper
color
with
a
twofinger
head
that
didnt
last
long
the
smell
is
a
mix
of
some
sweet
bready
smells
with
a
big
punch
of
hops
this
beer
definitely
has
a
lot
of
flavor
sweet
toffee
malt
that
gives
way
to
some
citrusy
and
slightly
piney
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
thick
with
some
moderate
carbonation
this
beer
is
definitely
tasty
but
the
hops
hit
a
little
hard
and
hurt
the
drinkability
a
bit
the
taste
was
almost
a
hybrid
of
a
healthy
west
coast
ipa
and
a
traditional
malty
english
ale
the
first
things
on
your
tongue
are
the
hops
oh
the
hops
but
it
wasnt
overwhelmingly
bitter
instead
they
opened
your
mouth
up
ready
for
the
malts
that
brought
you
through
the
finish
i
got
a
hint
of
dry
biscuits
with
a
hint
of
smokiness
in
the
malt
unfortunately
though
i
was
a
bit
distracted
by
the
slightly
thin
and
watery
mouth
which
didnt
seem
to
correspond
with
the
flavor
profile
of
the
beer
bier
however
it
is
a
tad
more
accurate
of
the
style
than
a
thicker
mouth
that
i
feel
would
have
been
more
satisfying
d
overall
very
good
very
easy
to
drink
with
a
nice
balance
of
flavors
reminds
me
of
a
maltcentric
pale
ale
d
somewhat
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
a
bad
beer
but
one
that
i
would
pass
on
in
the
future
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
from
southern
tier
that
i
have
bought
the
last
2
years
im
not
sure
how
well
it
fits
with
the
style
its
listed
its
listed
under
but
either
way
its
delicious
a
must
try
from
southern
tier
sampled
at
galaxy
hut
arlington
22
oz
bottle
poured
a
nice
clear
amber
color
with
a
small
creamy
offwhite
head
nice
lacing
aroma
is
musky
earthy
pine
and
resin
with
a
touch
of
citrus
grapefruit
a
full
bodied
brew
with
modest
carbonation
very
malty
and
sweet
but
good
balance
with
generous
bitter
hops
bittersweet
finish
that
dries
out
and
long
lasting
nice
and
creamy
on
the
palate
very
drinkable
i
might
be
impossible
to
brew
but
i
was
expecting
a
lighter
body
i
was
also
expecting
german
hop
flavors
and
aromas
not
to
be
the
style
police
but
it
really
comes
off
as
more
of
a
hoppy
american
style
barleywine
than
an
imperial
helles
i
guess
i
was
expecting
something
like
samuel
adams
imperial
pilsner
but
with
a
bit
of
munichvienna
malt
if
you
really
concentrate
and
can
manage
to
block
out
the
hops
there
might
be
a
helles
in
there
i
tried
this
beer
for
the
first
time
last
year
because
im
a
huge
fan
of
southern
tiers
brews
but
not
a
big
lager
fan
the
strength
of
this
beer
is
mostly
in
the
taste
and
the
smell
the
most
important
criteria
really
i
think
they
really
dialed
this
one
in
for
ipa
lovers
a
k
a
bastardized
uber
american
take
on
a
german
style
lager
i
absolutely
love
this
beer
and
could
have
more
than
one
its
extreme
its
way
different
and
the
way
i
describe
this
to
my
curious
beer
drinking
friends
who
appreciate
good
beer
is
its
weird
for
the
style
but
it
works
if
youre
a
lover
of
ipas
you
have
to
try
this
before
its
gone
for
another
year
if
youre
a
lager
lover
the
hop
kick
of
this
might
leave
you
walking
away
scratching
your
head
and
asking
yourself
what
the
was
that
or
who
was
that
masked
man
this
is
a
good
brew
check
it
out
this
was
too
strange
and
bitter
to
really
drink
a
ton
but
this
was
good
ill
buy
another
bottle
next
year

is
very

bonus
points
for
a

on
the
lable
dactually
pretty
darn
awesome
this
is
way
better
than
i
expected
it
would
be
leave
it
to
southern
tier
to
do
it
again
after
having
this
beer
i
realized
that
i
need
to
change
my
question
from
why
imperialize
a
lager
to
why
the
hell
would
you
have
a
helles
lager
when
you
could
have
an
imperial
helles
lager
that
about
sums
it
up
completely
changed
my
view
on
helles
lagers
and
what
they
can
be
worth
a
shot
i
might
try
it
again
next
year
myself
d
probably
will
never
have
again
but
i
was
very
excited
to
give
it
a
try
my
mission
of
st
beers
is
technically
complete
now
with
just
three
more
stragglers
to
jot
down
if
your
into
helles
lagers
than
i
would
recommend
all
others
are
at
their
risk
d
delicious
allinall
but
im
not
really
picking
up
lager
or
pilsner
anywhere
the
alcohol
is
apparent
but
compliments
the
taste
so
thats
not
a
bad
thing
very
nice
and
im
glad
i
tried
it
ill
have
to
pick
up
a
bottle
d
very
drinkable
unless
someone
has
a
very
great
dislike
for
the
more
hoppy
bitter
beers
only
the
9
abv
keep
it
from
being
a
good
candidate
for
sessioning
d
does
a
style
defined
by
its
subtle
and
understated
nature
really
need
to
be
imperialized
naturally
this
bears
basically
no
resemblance
to
an
actual
helles
its
like
a
cross
between
a
pilsner
and
an
ipa
in
the
end
though
it
ends
up
being
worse
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
medium
body
good
amount
of
carbonation
some
warmth
from
alcohol
but
not
overwhelming
a
complex
interesting
lager

small
snifter
nice
copperreddish
tone
in
the
color
nice
2
finger
head
with
a
good
lacing
in
the
glass
not
much
in
the
way
of
carbonation
sweet
pine
floral
notes
that
i
didnt
really
expect
in
this
brew
this
brew
is
tastey
pine
and
grassy
notes
right
in
the
first
sip
the
mouthfeel
feels
somewhat
lighter
at
first
but
a
somewhat
oily
finish
the
alcohol
is
pretty
relaxing
not
to
strong
i
have
been
looking
forward
to
trying
this
fresh
for
a
few
months
merry
krampus
too
bad
overll
another
excellent
selection
from
stbc
absolutely
delicious
d
i
enjoyed
this
beer
but
feel
like
it
is
a
bottle
best
split
between
friends
the
flavors
particularly
the
booziness
become
overpowering
with
time
notes
its
decent
but
not
particularly
of
my
liking
im
not
specially
fond
of
the
larger
strain
and
here
it
is
pumped
up
and
expanded
so
if
that
is
something
that
sounds
enticing
this
might
be
for
you
biting
and
a
bit
harsh
for
me
in
this
incarnation
pours
a
light
amber
decent
head
that
leaves
good
lacing
solid
looking
beer
smell
is
big
on
the
hops
with
some
bready
notes
going
on
and
some
sweetness
taste
is
big
on
the
hops
with
a
very
faint
alcohol
bite
fresh
doughlike
flavor
strikes
me
citrus
and
piney
hops
with
some
good
malt
backbone
pretty
mellow
for
the
amount
going
on
here
mouthfeel
is
relatively
thin
but
has
a
good
relaxing
feel
to
it
a
good
solid
beer
though
not
what
i
expected
pours
a
clear
redamber
with
a
one
and
a
half
finger
head
that
has
decent
retention
medium
lacing
is
left
on
my
pint
glass
smell
has
a
nice
malt
backbone
with
a
good
balance
of
hops
the
strength
is
a
bit
weak
but
what
is
there
is
good
hops
are
piney
and
fruity
i
pick
up
a
bit
of
yeast
too
taste
is
the
best
part
of
this
beer
good
malt
backbone
with
a
nice
balance
of
hops
hops
are
also
a
bit
piney
and
fruity
citrus
and
grapefruit
come
to
mind
i
like
the
malthop
balance
the
pine
reminds
me
of
the
holidays
mouthfeel
is
tiny
bit
watery
for
the
big
taste
and
alcohol
there
is
a
bit
of
warming
but
it
is
a
good
aspect
the
carbonation
is
appropriate
drinkability
is
good
the
beer
tastes
great
and
the
mouthfeel
doesnt
factor
into
db
for
me
the
price
is
a
tiny
bit
much
for
this
beer
i
think
the
taste
will
hold
up
too
good
beer
from
st
really
solid
brewery
so
far
cheers
a
very
odd
but
interesting
brew
fits
southern
tiers
mo
quite
nicely
i
enjoyed
this
one
but
the
price
deters
me
from
enjoying
too
many
of
these
overall
a
very
solid
and
very
strong
ale
here
light
in
body
but
it
packed
a
wallop
definitely
a
one
and
done
for
me
drinkability
very
good
for
the
style
i
would
have
only
one
due
to
the
high
abv
but
would
want
one
more
in
the
season
not
a
case
the
hop
mix
is
strong
but
not
overpowering
this
was
a
nice
surprise
southern
tier
is
hit
or
miss
for
me
this
one
hit
i
really
enjoy
southern
tier
beers
and
this
beer
is
enjoyable
but
it
simply
is
an
ale
with
a
big
hop
profile
of
woody
and
citrus
character
it
is
certainly
not
a
double
or
imperial
pilsner
nor
a
helles
as
the
bottle
states
now
not
all
good
beers
are
to
style
i
would
never
claim
that
this
brew
however
is
way
too
rough
and
way
to
influenced
by
the
west
coast
hop
scene
to
even
resemble
a
helles
or
pilsner
thats
not
to
say
that
i
dont
like
iti
dothis
is
just
more
of
an
american
strong
than
any
type
of
european
lager
sweet
caramel
d
smooth
each
sip
leaves
me
wanting
some
more
wouldnt
want
a
second
but
the
one
was
nice
medium
bodied
interesting
flavor
overall
good
decent
some
aftertaste
no
bitterness
really
some
sweetness
up
front
an
odd
brew
for
sure
second
taste
im
a
little
slow
this
is
my
last
beer
for
the
night
some
nutty
character
to
it
and
i
can
taste
the
alcohol
unfortunate
drinkability
moderate
mouthfeel
is
fine
poured
into
an
oversized
pilsner
glass
very
impressive
appearance
a
deep
amber
color
with
two
finger
white
head
nice
lacing
all
the
way
down
the
glass
piney
citrusy
aroma
that
really
presented
itself
with
the
first
drink
nice
creamy
mouthfeel
but
for
a
lager
this
was
very
hoppy
as
it
warmed
the
malts
presented
themselves
a
bit
more
but
it
definitely
finishes
dry
the
high
abv
is
there
but
to
its
credit
this
is
a
grower
not
a
shower
enjoyable
but
id
definitely
only
have
one
per
sitting
that
being
said
this
is
a
great
beer
that
ill
have
again
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
i
only
wish
it
tasted
exactly
how
it
smells
d
this
beer
i
will
for
sure
not
buy
again
really
a
disappointment
i
expect
more
from
st
d
hopmalt
balance
is
a
little
off
alcohol
is
well
covered
a
deceptively
drinkable
imperial
helles
lager
that
is
much
better
than
most
holiday
offerings
ive
had
thus
far
the
only
reason
being
that
it
pushes
the
envelope
for
what
a
helles
lager
can
be
not
all
beers
need
to
be
imperialized
however
if
you
have
the
skills
and
the
patience
do
it
22oz
bottle
served
in
a
boulevard
tank
7
tulip
poured
a
clear
ambergold
with
a
finger
of
white
head
malty
aroma
with
some
piney
hops
some
carmelized
sugar
in
the
aroma
and
a
hint
of
alcohol
medium
bodied
with
a
fair
amount
of
carbonation
plenty
of
malt
in
the
flavor
with
a
clean
lager
profile
good
amount
of
hop
bitterness
dry
hoppy
finish
a
little
hot
from
the
alcohol
this
was
like
a
lager
version
of
a
barley
wine
not
bad
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
it
next
season
the
smell
nd
taste
are
all
about
the
hops
with
a
touch
of
caramel
malt
to
keep
things
within
the
realm
of
balance
the
mouthfeel
starts
off
pretty
big
but
soon
balanced
by
the
dry
finish
and
high
carbonation
the
end
result
is
very
drinkable
like
a
dry
dipa
with
a
clean
lagered
finish
recommended
this
is
definitely
a
great
holiday
brew
especially
if
you
dont
want
all
the
spices
taste
is
smooth
and
toasty
really
good
beer
i
like
it
a
lot
has
a
light
hop
to
it
and
a
light
sweetness
in
the
body
d
this
drinks
like
a
malty
dipa
maybe
thats
just
because
i
havent
had
a
whole
lot
of
beers
that
fit
this
style
never
the
less
a
very
interesting
beer
and
worth
the
try
due
to
the
burn
and
the
syrupy
texture
this
one
is
not
suited
for
a
session
overall
a
little
disappointing
and
now
the
least
favorite
of
my
southern
tier
brews
drinkability
yet
another
st
bomber
i
wish
the
made
sixers
of
d
an
excellent
sipper
for
the
style
enough
going
on
to
keep
it
interesting
wish
i
had
this
a
little
fresher
as
i
think
some
of
the
hops
have
died
but
doesnt
prevent
this
from
being
an
excellent
beer
d
can
a
9
be
drinkable

bottle
poured
a

with
a
large
pure
white
frothy

with
great
retention
and
very
good
lacing

orange
and
dry

is
quite
enjoyable
with
some

taste
is
a
balance
between
some
sweet
malt
with
notes
of
fry
european
hops
light
phenols
and
some
orange
notes
quite
particular
overall
body
is
quite
full
with
great
carbonation
and
no
signs
of
the
alcohol
interesting
experiment
overall
thought
not
something
i
would
drink
every
day
d
incredibly
drinkable
for
9
abv
but
this
fits
as
an
imperial
apa
more
than
a
helles
in
my
opinion
surprisingly
big
body
and
hoppy
character
but
another
winner
from
southern
tier
with
the
exception
of
imperial
cherry
saison
and
the
possible
exception
of
creme
brulee
ive
been
either
impressed
or
supremely
impressed
with
every
southen
tier
brew
that
has
come
down
the
pike
if
rudolphs
nose
ever
goes
on
the
blink
a
bomber
of
this
bad
boy
will
allow
santas
nose
to
light
the
rest
of
the
journey
with
no
trouble
at
all
bottom
line
krampus
is
an
enjoyable
sipper
whether
early
autumn
morning
or
late
winter
night
drinkability
might
be
someones
cup
of
tea
but
not
mine
dont
think
it
was
spoiled
just
didnt
care
for
it
and
i
usually
like
double
pils
my
first
disappointment
from
southern
tier
d
moderate
a
heavy
hitter
and
this
beer
doesnt
hide
it
still
enjoyable
and
very
tasty
would
buy
again
in
fact
i
did
picked
up
a
case
of
this
stuff
cheers
i
love
this
beer
fresh
know
it
well
and
was
excited
to
find
a
couple
of
bottles
recently
it
has
lost
some
of
its
fresh
pine
qualities
and
shifted
towards
the
phenolic
with
age
definitely
much
better
fresh
but
it
is
still
working
nice
for
me
cant
wait
for
this
one
to
show
up
on
store
shelves
again
this
winter
d
overall
i
found
this
to
be
a
little
too
heavy
and
sweet
i
typically
like
a
helles
to
be
crisp
and
refreshing
but
this
was
a
bit
too
over
the
top
i
generally
love
southern
tiers
big
beers
but
this
one
was
just
a
little
underwhelming
overall
i
first
thought
an
imperial
helles
would
be
bocklike
but
this
is
nowhere
near
there
this
is
an
imperial
pilsner
trying
to
be
softer
but
the
hops
just
didnt
cooperate
love
southern
tier
but
this
will
be
a
pass
if
rereleased
in
the
future
its
hard
to
complain
about
krampus
especially
after
reading
the
entertaining
blurb
on
the
side
of
the
bottlehumorous
stuff
its
pretty
good
beer
and
i
admit
that
im
accustomed
to
being
spoiled
by
st
offerings
this
is
a
good
notch
and
a
half
below
stellar
wares
such
as
gemini
unearthly
and
mokah
but
good
nonetheless
wellbalanced
but
with
both
malts
and
hops
on
the
heavy
side
great
xmas
time
beer
will
look
for
it
again
next
winter
i
guess
its
a
mocne
pour
copper
with
a
decent
head
beer
is
apple
malt
in
the
nose
and
palate
nose
is
plagued
with
ethanol
as
it
gets
warmer
apple
and
lemon
make
it
somewhat
english
ipa
an
euro
lager
with
too
much
alcohol
well
hopped
with
a
lemon
zest
and
mild
grapefruit
bitter
an
apple
sweet
is
nice
but
not
very
broad
i
get
lost
in
the
over
amping
of
a
mild
style
to
extenuate
the
palate
it
has
a
stronger
style
not
much
wider
though
overall
the
grassy
citrus
nose
really
dominates
if
you
love
that
dry
hop
with
willamette
otherwise
dont
its
a
pleasant
beer
but
not
one
id
grab
a
second
bottle
of
instead
of
trying
something
different
nice
one
to
share
md
nicely
done
holiday
beer
with
just
a
bit
of
spice
and
warmth
easy
to
drink
totally
not
true
to
the
style
and
although
i
liked
this
beer
it
just
leaves
me
wondering
why
a
beer
of
this
style
is
made
a
little
bite
to
go
with
a
crisp
fizzy
feel
somewhat
creamy
great
for
style
i
really
like
this
beer
the
hops
are
complex
and
great
the
malts
put
out
the
fizzy
fire
drinkability
its
a
hoppy
imperialized
helles
alright
if
thats
your
bag
then
you
might
dig
this
one
otherwise
if
you
go
in
with
a
little
understanding
a
little
openmindedness
you
still
just
might
like
it
again
this
needs
to
be
compared
with
the
socalled
doubleimperial
pilsners
otherwise
its
totally
offkilter
as
a
traditional
helles
looks
very
nice
pours
a
clear
copperorange
color
with
a
gigantic
white
foamy
head
the
smell
is
very
strong
with
citrus
hops
the
taste
is
is
crisp
with
citrus
hops
and
then
a
blast
of
bitterness
bitter
hopsalcoholcirtus
flavorsgrapefruitand
bread
yeast
make
this
a
very
tasty
brew
the
mf
is
light
for
a
high
octane
beerbut
the
flavors
work
well
together
all
in
allthis
a
very
good
beer
from
one
of
the
east
coasts
better
breweries
drinkability
a
curious
beer
that
i
enjoyed
but
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
d
big
yes
but
this
one
could
sneek
up
on
you
notes
this
was
a
delicious
big
bold
slow
sipper
of
a
beer
d
a
tasty
lager
which
was
not
at
all
what
id
expect
but
very
flavorful
and
drinkable
just
the
same
especially
for
9
the
went
great
with
my
nofiller
crab
cake
drinkability
southern
tier
serves
up
another
beer
that
pushes
the
boundaries
of
beer
although
this
isnt
my
favorite
release
from
them
it
still
has
that
really
clean
southern
tier
taste
that
ive
come
to
admire
and
love
its
a
really
interesting
beer
that
wont
be
to
everybodys
liking
but
at
least
its
worth
a
try
drinkability
although
theres
a
lot
of
flavor
there
and
its
balanced
the
yeastiness
and
alcohol
cut
down
on
its
drinkability
drinkability
is
exception
this
really
hit
the
spot
especially
because
its
way
better
then
i
expected
smooth
and
tasty
with
the
alcohol
very
well
hidden
it
went
down
with
ease
calling
it
a
helles
larger
though
is
pretty
much
ridiculous
but
i
didnt
score
it
to
style
because
i
dont
know
of
one
for
strong
hoppy
amber
lagers
another
fantastic
value
and
wildly
successful
experiment
from
the
boys
at
southern
tier
poured
from
the
bomber
into
a
pint
glass
this
brew
is
a
clear
copper
color
with
a
midland
white
head
and
nice
lacing
the
aroma
is
somewhat
shocking
like
a
tart
savignon
blanc
white
grapes
and
a
hint
of
light
clovey
bubblegum
confusing
the
taste
is
a
unique
blend
of
sweet
clove
and
some
double
ipa
type
of
maltiness
with
grapefruit
hops
at
first
i
recoil
in
confused
infamiliarity
but
this
grows
on
you
after
the
initial
white
wine
impressions
i
find
that
generous
mouthfuls
really
help
bring
out
the
balance
that
smooths
this
odd
brew
into
something
pretty
special
this
seems
like
a
combination
of
white
wine
and
a
mild
dipa
it
brings
some
belgian
hints
soso
drinkability
but
not
overly
heavy
maybe
what
could
be
called
a
desert
beer
this
is
something
to
surprise
your
fellow
ba
with
challenge
those
taste
buds
and
celebrate
the
holidays
with
this
unusual
offering
a
pleasurable
experience
happy
holidays
from
the
venerable
southern
tier
very
drinkable
despite
its
strength
i
think
i
just
drank
most
of
a
bomber
while
writing
this
and
im
feeling
a
bit
of
panic
that
i
only
have
one
md
medium
bodied
and
very
sticky
the
hops
resins
just
coat
the
mouth
alcohol
is
well
masked
as
well
but
still
provides
a
nice
warmth
d
despite
having
a
crispness
this
beer
packs
a
pretty
filling
punch
plus
the
description
of
krampus
on
the
bottle
was
quite
entertaining
had
this
been
available
to
me
during
christmas
i
would
have
had
this
on
christmas
morning
regardless
of
what
st
does
their
beers
tend
to
be
over
the
top
and
that
makes
them
worth
a
try
i
plan
on
using
this
beer
while
cooking
with
seafood
plus
this
calls
for
some
deafening
riffs
d
very
good
for
a
beer
of
this
strength
9abv
d
easy
to
drink
to
say
the
least
goes
down
smooth
and
isnt
harsh
cheers
whatever
i
was
or
wasnt
expecting
what
i
got
is
a
big
rich
sweet
and
wonderfully
hoppy
blend
of
happy
good
stuff
the
malt
is
more
subtly
edged
than
in
most
ipas
but
the
hops
would
match
well
against
most
leading
to
a
curious
and
refreshing
departure
the
hefty
abv
be
damned
it
drinks
just
fine
i
think
ill
take
krampus
over
st
nick
any
day
thank
you
kindly
d
good
if
you
like
a
hopped
to
the
max
helles
which
i
do
drinkability
is
pretty
good
the
sweetness
is
maybe
a
touch
on
the
high
side
to
me
sure
it
has
to
balance
the
higher
abv
but
with
the
bitterness
fairly
low
the
tripod
ends
up
cocked
to
one
side
with
a
little
less
residual
sweetness
this
would
be
a
real
winner
pours
a
clear
coppery
orange
very
brilliant
colour
thick
white
head
forms
drops
down
to
a
solid
ring
around
the
glass
and
leaves
a
pretty
tight
spiral
of
lace
on
the
glass
great
retention
smell
is
neat
quite
sweet
caramel
and
brown
sugar
but
very
biscuity
and
very
clean
some
apricot
and
a
sweet
fruitiness
some
floral
hopping
orange
peel
and
some
neat
spiciness
to
it
taste
is
very
sweet
and
syrupy
lots
of
caramel
and
honey
brown
sugar
clean
bready

some

lightly

dry

quite
dry
and
alcoholic
going
down
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
syrupy
with
low
to
medium
carbonation
a
touch
too
sweet
to
be
really
drinkable
to
me
but
it
is
a
pretty
neat
take
on
the
style
very
warming
going
down
alcohol
is
a
little
rough
not
a
bad
beer
though
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
a
12
beige
head
over
the
clear
dark
amber
brew
frothy
head
lasts
well
with
plenty
of
foamy
lace
aroma
is
spicy
yeasts
and
piney
hops
taste
is
sweet
upfront
quickly
followed
by
assertive
hops
that
pretty
dominate
the
rest
of
the
experience
mouthfeel
is
smooth
but
drinkability
levaes
a
bit
to
be
desired
the
imperial
part
here
has
been
given
too
much
to
the
hops
which
doesnt
let
of
the
other
character
through
krampus
is
a
perfectly
clear
amber
lager
with
a
foamy
offwhite
head
that
leaves
thick
foamy
lacing
and
has
good
retention
it
has
a
strong
aroma
thats
a
touch
sweet
juicy
like
orange
juice
spicy
like
cinnamon
and
clove
there
are
notes
of
hay
and
spice
cake
it
is
medium
bodied
smooth
and
a
bit
bubbly
the
finish
is
light
and
dry
wow
the
flavor
is
more
complex
than
i
expected
it
is
slightly
sweet
and
quite
bitter
its
a
nice
wooden
spice
with
notes
of
orange
peel
clove
nutmeg
and
oak
it
shows
nice
balance
this
is
some
serious
drinking
here
i
really
didnt
need
the
entire
22
not
a
beer
i
would
drink
all
the
time
but
would
drink
again
a
mediumdark
brown
that
when
served
in
a
tulip
glass
had
a
onefinger
head
minor
lacings
a
herbal
tealike
almost
grainy
veggie
like
hop
burst
not
a
strong
smell
but
you
can
pick
up
lots
of
hops
in
the
nose
the
hops
are
plentiful
in
the
mouth
and
lead
to
a
fruitiness
to
the
beer
most
notably
grapefruit
along
with
hints
of
citricness
mediumbodied
and
smooth
but
still
contains
a
good
drying
backbite
as
the
hop
bitterness
really
comes
through
in
the
end
not
sweet
or
anything
but
there
are
caramel
and
other
sugary
malts
more
than
any
other
malt
that
push
there
way
through
while
it
passes
the
tongue
a
great
beer
to
relax
with
and
i
still
dont
believe
it
is
almost
10

this
is
one
tasty
brew
this
beer
poured
a
clear
gold
with
a
nice
white
head
that
went
away
quickly
the
smell
was
fantastic
pine
needles
grapefruit
sweet
caramel
and
some
spicy
pepper
the
taste
was
equally
as
good
the
piney
hops
balanced
by
the
caramel
maltiness
with
a
hint
of
grapefruit
i
really
like
the
way
all
this
stuff
is
balanced
in
here
it
makes
the
beer
very
drinkable
i
didnt
get
any
hint
of
the
9
abv
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
pretty
crisp
in
the
mouth
dry
finish
im
glad
we
split
a
bottle
of
this
because
theres
no
chance
i
would
drink
a
bomber
to
myself
between
the
pine
tree
smell
and
the
offness
of
the
taste
i
just
didnt
enjoy
it
special
note
i
did
like
the
little
story
on
the
side
of
krampus
and
how
he
hands
out
punishments
to
all
the
bad
children
during
xmas
plus
the
little
devil
guykrampus
on
the
label
is
hilarious
he
has
a
large
broken
stick
of
wood
in
one
hand
and
what
looks
like
a
whip
in
the
other
all
the
while
his
tongue
is
sticking
out
upwards
in
a
curled
snakelike
shape
maybe
he
had
some
of
this
beer
and
hes
trying
to
cleanse
his
tongue
of
spicy
hop
dust
no
head
on
this

great
hoppy
beer
great
drinkablity
for
a
hop
bomb
thanks
to
beerdiablo
for
bringing
this
out
drinkability
easy
to
drink
would
go
well
with
food
d
while
i
found
this
beer
to
be
very
interesting
i
cannot
say
i
would
drink
it
often
it
is
basically
a
dipa
fermented
with
lager
yeast
sort
of
a
superduper
hoppy
california
common
regardless
of
the
style
though
it
is
interesting
and
worth
a
try
pours
a
deep
copper
with
a
good
sized
off
white
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
while
smells
of
citrus
and
floral
hops
a
bit
of
caramel
malt
some
alcohol
and
an
almost
belgian
yeast
character
in
there
too
tastes
more
malt
than
the
aroma
would
suggest
caramel
and
spicy
floral
and
citrus
hops
fight
it
out
a
bit
of
mineral
in
there
as
well
full
bodied
crisp
carbonation
creamysyrupy
mouthfeel
this
is
definitely
another
outside
the
box
brew
from
southern
tier
god
i
love
them
for
that
this
one
reminds
me
of
a
barley
wine
at
times
i
need
to
procure
another
one
for
further
evaluation
bomber
poured
into
an
ithaca
excelsior
tulip
appears
a
very
rich
copper
color
with
a
fair
amount
of
thick
offwhite
head
very
clear
in
the
glass
but
much
darker
than
i
was
expecting
kind
of
a
weird
floral
or
fruity
aroma
up
front
with
some
toffee
tones
blurred
malt
flavors
trying
to
jump
out
and
shine
but
are
mostly
held
back
and
muddled
together
light
caramel
toast
and
slight
roast
mixed
into
one
monotoned
flavor
i
dont
find
it
very
pleasing
some
lemony
bitterness
comes
into
play
at
the
end
heavy
mouthfeel
with
medium
carbonation
this
is
not
very
drinkable
in
my
opinion
it
is
heavy
the
malt
flavors
are
not
crisp
and
defined
and
im
picking
up
on
some
sort
of
a
weird
offaroma
not
one
of
my
favorites
from
southern
tier
by
any
means
i
was
looking
for
a
completely
different
beer
here
its
a
miss
for
me
the
style
would
have
definitely
fooled
me
the
flavors
resemble
more
of
a
double
ipa
or
an
imperial
pilsener
than
of
a
helles
big
pleasant
flavors
far
from
being
smooth
or
balanced
a
nice
experiment
but
one
that
lacks
cohesion
drinkability
and
maturity
its
not
the
alcohol
that
makes
this
a
sipper
its
the
sheer
amount
of
hop
flavor
and
a
good
amount
of
malt
crammed
into
this
beer
your
taste
buds
can
only
handle
so
much
but
i
love
that
beers
like
this
are
pushing
the
limits
d
after
the
novelty
wore
off
this
became
difficult
to
finish
southern
tier
has
released
a
very
interesting
beer
here
hmph
an
imperial
helles
lager
its
a
little
hoppier
than
i
expected
for
the
style
but
im
not
complaining
it
works
plus
this
is
a
beer
representing
the
darker
or
shall
i
say
naughtier
side
of
christmas
recommended
without
reservation
drinkability
good
not
a
bad
beer
but
nothing
i
would
want
again
this
one
pours
an
orangish
brown
with
an
off
white
head
that
fades
fast
and
leaves
lacing
the
smell
is
somewhat
fruity
with
sweet
citrus
and
hop
notes
this
beer
is
full
of
flavor
that
dances
around
the
hop
and
citrus
notes
pop
with
some
spices
that
i
cannot
pinpoint
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
a
medium
body
good
carbonation
and
a
nice
balance
of
many
flavors
the
drinkability
is
ok
the
high
abv
and
strong
flavors
might
push
some
away
but
i
definitely
recommend
this
beer
especially
if
you
like
a
lot
of
flavor
and
a
good
balance
of
hops
pours
a
clear
bright
tangerine
color
with
a
full
finger
light
earthy
foam
collar
that
has
nice
retention
and
sheets
of
belgian
lacing
the
smell
is
timid
but
altogehter
bright
and
earthy
with
a
sweet
sticky
citrus
fruitiness
full
bodied
and
adequately
carbonated
the
mouth
feel
is
tangy
and
slightly
bitter
with
a
crisp
almost
dry
finish
hats
off
once
again
to
the
st
family
a
little
late
for
this
holiday
i
can
see
this
becoming
a
local
seasonal
favorite
the
balanced
piny
hop
resin
and
tangerine
flavors
mixed
with
the
sweet
malty
goodness
rocks
highly
recommended
happy
holidays
more
like
a
german
dipa
than
a
imperial
helles
to
me
but
a
nice
beer
nonetheless
bottle
sent
to
me
by
kkulacki
as
part
of
an
awesome
beer
package
just
before
christmas
pours
a
nice
orange
brown
very
clear
with
a
thin
off
white
head
nice
level
of
obvious
carbonation
smells
of
light
pilsner
malt
fruity
ethanol
grassy
to
spicy
hops
flavor
is
interesting
sharp
almost
puckering
bitterness
with
suggestions
of
grapefruit
but
this
sits
nicely
on
the
high
alcohol
and
large
malt
presence
its
even
almost
balanced
breakfast
citrus
flavor
sticks
around
and
works
well
medium
bodied
with
a
bit
of
syrupy
character
but
not
too
much
drinks
well
but
the
big
alcohol
goes
to
the
head
fast
on
the
better
side
of
the
southern
tier
scale
of
beers
na
zdravje
this
is
a
thick
beer
that
gets
thicker
as
it
is
drunk
with
the
malts
taking
over
the
tongue
more
and
more
this
beer
ultimately
wore
out
my
taste
buds
ill
take
it
for
a
special
glass
but
not
for
more
d
drinkability
was
nice
more
of
a
hop
bomb
then
anything
else
a
beer
that
just
as
easily
could
have
been
a
ipa
an
imperial
helles
lager
my
only
knock
would
be
in
regards
to
a
nonsense
style
but
still
regarded
this
as
a
good
drink
picked
up
a
bomber
at
the
cellars
in
woodbury
for
about
7
poured
a
hazy
yellow
with
a
very
short
head
im
really
not
sure
this
beer
fits
into
any
style
while
it
is
light
in
color
and
presumably
a
lager
it
bears
little
resemblance
to
a
munich
helles
lager
im
not
complaining
this
is
a
big
and
relatively
drinkable
hopbomb
the
willamette
dry
hops
give
a
light
and
juicy
citrus
start
that
rolls
into
woodsy
herbs
worth
a
try
and
tasty
ive
enjoyed
all
the
southern
tier
products
ive
tried
but
this
one
just
didnt
do
it
for
me
in
my
pilsener
glass
the
beer
was
an
amber
color
with
a
thick
white
head
that
quickly
dissipated
the
aroma
confused
me
a
little
malt
fruit
and
spice
that
didnt
go
well
together
same
thing
with
the
taste
i
thought
the
beer
was
overly
spiced
and
not
terribly
enjoyable
pours
a
very
nice
cleanclear
dark
golden
orange
color
very
nice

very
nice

this
is
one

brew
i
like
and
highly
recommended
it
thanks
joe
this
is
a
great
one
from
one
of
my
favorite
ny
breweries
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
strong
kick
this
is
one
of
those
styles
where
if
you
try
to
go
imperial
with
it
you
lose
the
essence
of
the
style
in
my
opinion
so
i
dont
think
its
the
representation
of
the
style
however
its
still
a
decent
beer
just
not
one
of
the
better
beers
ive
had
i
guess
i
was
expecting
a
little
more
from
southern
tier
on
this
one
this
poured
a
clear
copper
color
with
a
bit
of
white
head
it
smelled
strongly
like
rose
with
cultured
yeast
and
copper
and
grassy
hops
and
a
bit
of
cherry
blossom
and
oak
it
tasted
like
powerful
rose
hops
with
some
sour
yeast
and
rusted
copper
hops
and
a
bit
f
roasted
barley
it
was
watery
with
some
carbonation
and
had
a
bitter
aftertaste
overall
this
had
a
very
clean
flavor
and
a
fitting
body
for
the
style
it
wasnt
quite
my
taste
but
this
was
definitely
a
well
constructed
beer
it
hid
the
alcohol
well
which
made
it
pretty
easy
to
drink
not
really
a
holiday
beer
to
me
and
not
one
that
id
personally
try
again
but
i
would
recommend
it
to
others
as
an
early
autumn
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
dark
amber
in
color
with
a
1
12
finger
head
and
some
above
average
lacing
the
smell
is
dominated
by
fresh
hops
and
some
sweet
spiced
malts
the
taste
is
bulit
around
a
german
hop
profile
with
rather
light
malt
flavorings
and
a
lingering
yeast
flavor
their
are
also
some
hints
of
lemon
and
almost
belgian
spices
the
mouthfell
is
of
a
larger
beer
but
not
to
thick
and
its
a
pretty
drinkable
brew
i
have
no
idea
what
other
helles
lagers
taste
like
but
this
is
very
good
especially
for
a
christmas
beer
i
definately
want
more
good
drinkable
beer
it
is
a
very
deep
amber
in
color
pretty
thick
but
with
only
the
slightest
head
the
smell
was
pretty
confusing
there
was
a
lot
going
on
and
not
all
of
it
good
definitely
some
spicy
hops
some
raisin
or
sort
of
a
candied
fruit
basically
a
nottoosweet
smell
something
fruity
but
kind
of
heavy
it
tastes
pretty
much
like
it
tastes
definitely
a
spicy
hop
taste
it
definitely
turns
a
little
sour
and
bitter
honestly
i
couldnt
quite
figure
out
what
it
was
i
think
raisins
is
a
good
description
it
feels
fine
in
the
mouth
but
not
a
ton
of
carbonation
overall
not
a
superdrinkable
beer
because
its
sort
of
muddled
however
it
is
definitely
unique
and
i
am
glad
i
gave
it
a
shot
that
said
there
are
plenty
of
better
southern
tier
options
out
there
pours
a
clear
coppery
amber
with
tall
frothy
offwhite
head
good
retention
and
nice
clinging
lacing
smells
of
spicy
hops
dry
grass
pine
mint
citrus
grapes
caramel
and
bread
tastes
big
of
spicy
hops
right
off
the
bat
which
sticks
throughout
pine
resin
mint
and
light
citrus
notes
come
through
up
front
along
with
some
grapes
and
maybe
some
apple
backbone
consists
of
candy
caramel
and
some
bread
crust
with
a
finish
of
more
hop
bitterness
combined
with
some
alcohol
medium
full
in
body
with
moderate
carbonation
bittering
with
some
sweetness
smooth
and
crisp
but
also
chewy
not
quite
sure
what
to
make
of
this
the
hophead
in
me
loves
it
but
for
the
style
it
hits
far
from
the
mark
for
this
hophead
it
didnt
take
long
to
cut
through
22oz
of
krampus
pours
a
slightly
hazy
golden
amber
color
with
an
average
dense
head
that
settled
into
a
sparse
cap
with
some
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
a
mix
of
sweet
citrus
hop
and
spicy
belgian
like
yeast
quite
interested
what
this
is
going
to
taste
like
the
taste
has
an
overall
sweetness
with
a
kick
of
hoppy
bitterness
in
the
end
krampus
has
a
spicy
yeast
and
hop
profile
that
yields
a
tropical
fruit
and
citrus
flavor
it
has
a
bready
malt
but
nothing
that
would
remind
me
of
munich
malt
what
so
ever
the
feel
is
nice
and
chewy
with
soft
carbonation
which
leads
to
a
silky
feely
good
balance
between
sweet
and
bitter
ah
the
new
age
old
question
do
you
really
need
an
imperial
helles
lager
after
this
i
would
say
no
a
helles
lager
is
a
fairly
delicate
style
that
cant
handle
the
imperial
tag
imho
a
helles
is
like
a
pils
in
order
to
let
the
malt
shine
which
it
is
suppose
to
you
need
to
keep
the
abv
in
check
the
sweet
bready
munich
malt
is
no
where
to
be
found
in
this
brew
while
this
brew
is
quite
tasty
it
does
not
resemble
a
munich
helles
lager
herbal
resinous
minty
hop
bitterness
up
front
strong
raw
hop
profile
stays
throughout
with
additional
flashes
of
pine
pine
sap
and
light
citrus
fruity
malt
backbone
shows
some
sweetness
along
with
some
caramel
slightly
warming
finish
with
some
fruity
esters
burrowed
beneath
lingering
hop
bitterness
the
big
noble
hop
presence
reminds
me
of
sa
imperial
pilsner
very
good
mediumfull
body
with
a
creamy
feel
interesting
and
tasty
d
very
drinkable
beer
and
i
didnt
even
notice
the
amount
of
alcohol
in
it
really
nice
blend
of
the
flavors
mfd
oily
and
clingy
goes
down
pretty
smooth
with
a
nice
warming
effect
d
this
22oz
is
going
down
mighty
easy
something
i
havent
experienced
with
a
southern
tier
beer
in
a
while
pours
a
nice
copper
color
with
great
retention
and
lacing
aroma
is
of
nice
pine
and
a
little
citrus
not
too
much
burn
for
a
9
0
lager
with
an
above
average
mouthfeel
which
is
nice
this
beer
goes
down
much
easier
than
it
should
for
such
high
abv
paired
this
with
some
monterrey
jack
cheese
but
am
thinking
would
be
perfect
with
some
christmas
sugar
cookies
a
great
beer
to
share
with
some
friends
and
family
over
the
holidays
d
goes
down
very
easy
for
a
9
abv
brew
drinkability
a
slow
sipping
beer
but
i
found
myself
wanting
to
open
up
a
second
bottle
after
this
emptied
interesting
beer
that
goes
well
in
front
of
a
fire
on
a
cold
winter
evening
the
beer
pours
a
dark
gold
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
crisp
and
refreshing
hop
nose
along
with
a
well
balanced
malt
aroma
the
taste
is
good
although
im
not
sure
what
an
imperial
helles
is
supposed
to
taste
like
its
quite
a
bit
heavier
than
a
regular
helles
and
the
hop
character
is
quite
a
bit
more
that
said
i
like
this
beer
its
flavorful
and
easy
drinking
even
at
9
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
good
drinking
beer
i
cant
wait
to
see
whats
brewing
next
this
is
interesting
but
its
a
bit
over
the
top
then
again
i
guess
thats
to
be
expected
with
an
imperial
helles
worth
a
try
but
probably
not
something
id
be
inclined
to
come
back
to
d
this
is
a
fascinating
beer
like
a
belgian
mixed
with
a
strong
lager
at
6
99
for
a
22oz
bottle
this
is
pricey
for
a
lager
albeit
a
strong
one
i
probably
will
not
buy
it
regularly
but
will
definitely
keep
it
in
the
repetiore
when
a
strong
lager
is
called
for
lots
of
hops
but
without
the
biting
bitterness
dry
and
astringent
full
bodied
with
a
low
level
outside
of
the
bitter
finish
this
is
a
relatively
mild
flavored
beer
i
liked
this
one
a
lot
strong
but
tasty
stuff
and
it
comes
at
you
with
some
nice
hops
not
normally
in
this
style
but
st
pulls
it
of
nicely
hey
if
you
want
to
trade
have
at
it
a
quality
euro
strong
lagera
good
example
of
that
style
with
significant
hops
a
little
soapy
head
on
orangey
body
a
good
amount
of
lace
the
hop
aroma
is
there
creamy
mouthfeel
initially
and
then
more
or
less
average
mouthfeel
not
too
drinkable
but
drinkable
bitterness
d
on
the
hoppy
side
but
fairly
smooth
for
9
recommended
d
pretty
easy
to
drink
but
i
dont
think
i
could
drink
this
everyday
of
the
season
22
ounce
bottle
served
in
a
pilsner
glass
the
beer
pours
a
clear
amberorange
color
with
about
an
inch
frothy
offwhite
head
head
retention
and
lacing
are
both
pretty
good
the
aroma
is
nice
it
smells
like
pine
and
citrusy
grapefruit
hops
with
a
bit
of
breadybiscuity
malt
too
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
but
the
malt
comes
out
more
in
the
taste
than
it
does
in
the
aroma
but
the
taste
still
has
a
good
bit
of
hops
in
it
some
spicy
hops
pepper
and
caramel
are
also
noticable
in
the
taste
has
a
good
sweetbitter
finish
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
slick
and
has
decent
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
its
smooth
has
decent
balance
and
the
9
abv
isnt
noticable
at
all
overall
id
say
this
is
another
very
good
southern
tier
brew
ill
definitely
buy
this
again
in
the
future
pours
a
rich
copper
orange
clear
body
and
average
head
carbonation
is
average
the
smell
is
mostly
hoppy
citrussy
grapefruit
the
hops
overpower
all
other
smells
except
a
little
alcohol
flavor
is
dominated
by
hopps
tangy
citrus
hops
soo
much
hops
that
i
wouldnt
be
able
to
tell
you
this
is
a
helles
style
to
start
with
it
tastes
like
a
rich
american
pale
ale
or
ipa
the
alcohol
is
the
only
other
flavor
that
is
not
drowned
out
by
the
hopps
and
a
fruity
finish
is
nice
mouthfeel
is
oily
and
slick
drinkability
is
averiage
although
for
being
9
i
find
its
pretty
smooth
overall
this
is
an
imperial
style
for
sure
but
a
hells
is
so
delicate
in
the
first
place
that
adding
a
bunch
of
hopps
just
drowns
out
all
the
other
characteristics
that
make
it
a
helles
this
beer
is
more
like
a
rich
ipa
another
beer
i
dont
get
does
not
have
any
characteristic
of
a
helles
lager
where
everything
is
in
balance
the
american
hop
bill
does
not
make
me
think
of
munich
tone
the
hops
down
a
bit
and
allow
the
malt
to
come
out
and
you
might
be
onto
something
maybe
use
mt
hood
hops
instead
of
willamette
as
well
i
found
it
difficult
to
drink
this
650ml
bottle
i
cant
give
it
as
great
a
score
as
it
could
due
to
the
style
confusion
still
a
great
beer
its
sticky
like
pine
sap
with
abv
showing
a
very
odd
beer
i
can
see
the
christmas
connection
but
too
sweet
despite
the
hoplike
pineness
and
perfumy
for
me
to
really
enjoy
much
also
i
dont
understand
the
connection
with
imperial
helles
lager
here
eh
not
what
im
looking
for
in
a
lager
and
not
what
im
looking
for
in
an
imperialstrength
beer
but
im
glad
i
tried
it
this
is
undeniably
different
from
germanys
helles
lagers
it
has
a
different
disposition
drinks
in
a
different
way
and
serves
a
wholly
different
drinking
experience
still
i
liked
the
krampus
and
its
whole
devilish
grinchlike
bottle
art
too
then
again
i
seem
to
like
most
everything
southern
tier
puts
out
seasonals
in
particular
if
krampus
is
for
the
bad
then
its
got
me
now
debating
between
being
naughty
or
nice
this
season
full
bodied
crisp
carbonation
offsets
a
bit
of
the
syrupiness
of
it
very
tasty
and
satisfying
if
a
tad
heavy
d
great
beer
and
certainly
a
different
take
on
a
helles
but
ill
pick
up
again
soon
overall
i
still
dont
really
get
what
an
imperial
helles
is
and
didnt
really
judge
it
against
the
munich
helles
style
because
i
dont
think
this
brew
is
anywhere
near
it
that
being
said
i
thought
this
was
a
really
good
offering
and
damn
fine
winter
seasonal
recommended
the
beer
poured
a
deep
honeyamber
with
a
thin
white
head
into
a
pint
glass
the
aroma
was
of
fresh
piney
hops
very
nice
the
flavor
was
an
appealing
combination
of
caramel
malt
in
the
forefront
with
a
smooth
hop
flavor
and
fairly
significant
hop
bitterness
at
the
finish
a
bigger
more
bitter
version
of
your
standard
german
helles
but
a
good
fit
for
the
high
abv
very
drinkable
yeah
this
is
strong
i
could
have
sworn
it
was
well
over
10
abv
when
i
was
drinking
this
but
alas
i
was
wrong
its
not
a
winter
warmer
but
given
the
upfront
maltiness
the
high
alcohol
content
and
spice
this
is
a
great
beer
for
the
holidays
i
have
no
idea
if
i
felt
the
right
notes
here
or
got
the
gist
of
this
beer
but
one
thing
for
sure
is
that
southern
tier
should
be
commended
for
going
out
on
a
limb
with
this
i
guarantee
ol
st
nick
couldnt
handle
a
krampus
methinks
the
excess
citrusrind
bite
precludes
extreme
drinkability
but
make
no
mistake
this
is
extremely
welldone
drinkability
not
my
favorite
style
in
the
world
but
theres
a
lot
to
admire
here
especially
the
kind
of
risktaking
and
ballsiness
to
the
brew
that
too
many
breweries
dont
want
to
take
a
chance
with
at
around
7
for
a
bomber
this
is
something
id
suggest
folks
try
as
i
think
many
would
like
this
plus
i
didnt
know
about
krampus
and
i
have
a
feeling
i
shouldve
been
handed
out
those
punishments
a
lot
as
a
kid
when
my
parents
were
too
nice
and
gave
me
gifts
anyway
and
since
it
took
me
about
two
hours
to
drink
this
with
its
complexity
constantly
growing
and
changing
thats
another
reason
to
try
it
this
is
an
interesting
and
delicious
beer
doesnt
have
any
helles
qualities
except
maybe
the
clean
malt
profile
but
its
a
joy
to
drink
anyways
the
taste
is
not
good
i
described
the
taste
as
sort
of
skunked
i
was
assured
that
was
on
purpose
okay
ick
not
my
favorite
style
mouthfeel
was
rather
nice
not
to
much
dancing
on
the
tongue
thanks
to
thirstybird
for
his
generosity

a

perhaps
some

the
mix

between
light

with
a
consistent
background
carbonation
and
a
slightly
oily
consistency
at
the
finish
my
first
helles
reminded
me
of
a
dipa
in
many
ways
another
great
offering
from
st
very
smooth
beer
i
couldnt
really
pick
too
much
up
on
the
alcohol
in
this
beer
so
i
would
give
it
a
nice
mark
for
drinkability
even
if
this
no
longer
resembles
a
helles
lager
i
still
approve
and
will
get
some
more
to
drink
a
nice
hoppy
lager
that
finishes
dry
and
a
surprising
drinkability
oh
so
good
i
didnt
know
a
helles
lager
could
be
this
dark
but
ill
bite
after
all
this
is
st
they
do
things
differently
and
im
glad
they
do
forget
santa
claus
this
krampus
guy
brings
the
real
gifts
excellent
d
others
have
mentioned
that
the
alcohol
is
barely
noticeable
i
highly
disagree
drinkability
is
not
easy
from
a
bomber
the
bizarre
hops
and
powerful
fuel
like
alcohol
dont
make
it
easy
still
a
solid
cold
weather
sipper
but
not
one
im
pushing
to
get
back
to
pours
a
clear
orangish
red
color
with
a
heavy
thick
wite
head
that
stays
around
for
ever
the
smell
of
hops
in
all
ther
floral
glory
take
my
nose
on
a
rush
of
excitement
the
taste
is
a
strong
pale
malt
at
first
then
floral
hops
and
a
hint
of
sourness
the
middle
is
ware
the
hops
change
into
extreamley
strong
piney
flavors
but
thay
only
last
for
a
few
moments
befor
the
sour
comes
back
at
the
end
this
is
a
great
lager
that
acts
more
like
an
ipa
till
the
verry
end

piney

biting
i
even
get
some
mild
hot

notes
i
like
just
about
every
sn
offering
and
appreciate
their
adventurous
attitude
but
i
doubt
i
would
go
for
this
one
again
real
soon
d
very
enjoyable
and
i
really
like
how
they
used
nontraditional
us
hops
instead
of
noble
hops
grape
and
gourmet
got
2
cases
of
this
and
put
it
out
for
the
thursday
beer
tasting
almost
everyone
who
sampled
it
bought
a
bottle
or
two
i
hope
they
can
get
some
more
very
impressive
i
was
hoping
this
experiment
would
parallel
great
lakes
imperial
dortmunder
undertaking
but
it
pales
in
comparison
this
one
has
very
minimal
traits
of
the
original
style
this
beer
pours
a
clear
light
amber
color
the
head
is
half
an
inch
in
height
and
recedes
quickly
into
sparse
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
grapefruit
and
pine
with
a
nice
bready
and
caramel
malt
backbone
the
taste
is
quite
bitter
grpaefuit
pine
and
herbal
spice
the
malt
comes
through
more
so
as
the
beer
warms
and
it
becomes
quite
balanced
the
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
with
lively
carbonation
and
a
velvety
texture
overall
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
i
have
never
had
an
imperial
helles
before
but
judging
from
the
imperial
pilseners
i
have
had
this
seems
to
be
what
i
would
expect
i
would
certainly
drink
this
again
pours
a
crystal
clear
copperyamber
color
decent
sized
tan
head
fades
slowly
and
leaves
rings
of
lacing
on
the
way
down
tons
and
tons
and
tons
of
piney
aromas
some
candysweet
malt
lingers
in
the
background
but
this
is
one
piney
smelling
brew
taste
definitely
delivers
on
the
pine
promise
but
the
malty
flavors
are
actually
pretty
rich
some
nice
caramel
flavors
and
a
faint
alcohol
hotness
really
clean
mouthfeel
lots
of
lingering
spicehops
yeah
southern
tier
does
it
again
love
this
d
this
is
another
great
brew
from
southern
tier
its
solid
through
and
through
and
a
great
beer
for
winter
3
65
d
drinkability
is
tough
it
pine
tree
esque
super
bitter
from
the
hops
i
like
it
though
definately
not
for
everyone
i
think
it
makes
for
a
good
winterholiday
beer
d
this
is
one
unique
christmas
beer
not
how
a
pictured
an
imperial
helles
but
you
can
certainly
tell
it
has
some
helles
characteristics
but
the
main
characters
in
this
one
are
the
spiciness
and
the
pine
an
awesome
christmas
beer
that
i
hope
st
brings
around
again
next
year
overall
not
a
helles
lager
in
my
book
but
southern
tier
says
otherwise
regardless
delicious
and
definitely
worth
seeking
out
southern
tier
sometimes
they
hit
sometimes
they
miss
but
they
are
always
interesting
krampus
hit
the
bullseye
for
me
smells
like
flowers
and
pinecones
the
aroma
reminds
me
of
cutting
open
the
little
bag
of
pellet
hops
and
stinking
my
nose
in
their
on
brew
day
there
is
also
a
bit
of
bready
malt
character
in
the
aroma
as
well
the
colour
is
a
clean
golden
big
white
head
with
good
retention
and
moderate
lace
flavour
is
very
hoppy
and
tastes
very
much
like
it
smells
the
malt
character
is
simple
and
bready
much
like
a
helles
should
be
bitterness
is
present
but
not
intense
very
light
bodied
and
dry
for
such
a
huge
beer
the
9
abv
is
totally
masked
overall
this
beer
is
fantastic
its
more
akin
to
a
dipa
than
a
helles
lager
but
the
lager
character
is
still
present
nicely
done
and
highly
recommended
overall
very
impressed
st
should
make
this
a
traditional
christmas
brew
as
i
would
make
sure
to
stock
up
on
this
every
year
after
i
finished
off
this
bomber
i
felt
like
krampus
gave
me
a
few
good
whacks
on
the
head
with
his
wooden
stick
mass
respect
for
st
on
coming
out
with
this
quality
brew
drinkability
is
awesome
the
complex
taste
leaves
you
wanting
more
after
each
taste
22oz
bomber
picked
up
at
bowery
beer
room
at
whole
foods
in
nyc
aroma
is
a
lot
like
a
bock
with
a
bigger
hop
presence
pine
some
citrus
really
interesting
taste
is
sort
of
surprising
really
dipay
but
with
a
lot
of
herbal
notes
citrus
as
well
at
first
the
hops
are
pretty
aggressive
but
it
mellows
pretty
quickly
reminds
me
of
the
sam
adams
imperial
pilsner
quite
a
bit
but
i
think
it
has
more
to
say
for
itself
happily
its
not
overbearing
at
all
really
well
balanced
with
a
nice
smooth
mouthfeel
excellent
drinkability
alcohol
is
well
hidden
really
original

great
unique
beer
from
southern
tier
pours
a
gluggily
clear
bright
amber
color
with
a
big
creamy
head
that
goes
nowhere
great
lacing

like

delicious

hoppy
in
fact

crazy
astringent

off

leaning
towards

heavy
body

finish
extremely
crisp

up
pine

demolished
palate
blindfolded
id
say
this
is
one
of
the
best
dipas
i
have
ever
had
sick
beer
the
hoppy
bitterness
completely
saves
the
day
with
this
beer
and
has
made
me
a
fan
it
helps
to
buoy
the
high
alcohol
and
the
sweet
malt
not
sure
anyone
would
call
this
a
helles
lager
but
i
will
say
this
this
is
an
excellent
beer
hopefully
availability
will
be
such
that
i
can
order
this
beauty
again
well
done
st
d
fantastic
drinkability
you
could
tell
me
this
was
a
4
session
beer
and
id
believe
it
and
with
the
crip
clean
finish
it
doesnt
grow
old
you
could
drink
these
as
long
as
you
can
see
straight
and
never
get
tired
of
it
an
excellent
winter
beer
ill
be
having
more
for
sure
pours
a
clear
medium
to
dark
amber
color
with
a
bountiful
dense
offwhite
head
aromas
are
extremely
hoppy
leaning
towards
the
floral
and
spicy
hops
with
little
citrus
theres
also
a
backnote
of
smokey
toasty
malts
that
nicely
round
out
the
nose
on
the
palate
things
are
just
really
weird
there
is
a
vague
sourness
mixing
with
bitterness
of
the
hops
and
then
a
touch
of
roastiness
from
the
malts
it
is
just
an
altogether
different
experience
from
any
other
beer
this
is
slightly
similar
to
other
imperial
pils
but
different
either
way
its
the
pioneering
sense
that
st
has
that
really
excites
me
to
try
their
future
beers
d
very
drinkable
this
beer
does
a
great
job
of
stepping
outside
of
the
helles
style
to
bring
it
to
something
else
imperial
helles
lager
fits
well
pours
a
perfectly
clear
amber
with
a
thin
creme
head
nose
is
an
unusual
mix
of
floral
and
piney
hops
nice
perfume
tones
the
flavor
on
this
is
so
dry
that
i
feel
like
i
should
have
a
glass
of
water
after
taking
a
sip
hoppy
tones
do
reside
yes
very
sharp
tones
of
citrus
mixed
with
floral
tones
strike
at
the
nose
its
distinct
and
odd
feel
is
sticky
and
slick
on
liquid
with
a
low
and
biting
carbonation
an
interesting
and
good
beer
an
imperial
helles
sure
okay
i
love
helles
lagers
and
i
liked
this
beer
too
but
this
really
is
no
helles
lager
anymore
a
completely
different
but
tasty
animal
not
sure
this
style
needed
imperializing
as
it
changed
the
beer
completely
damn
good
stuff
recommended
if
you
can
get
it
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
helps
with
the
alcohol
presence
but
this
one
is
constantly
a
touch
bitter
so
that
detracts
from
this
category
favorite
line
off
the
back
reads
merry
krampmas
to
all
and
to
all
a
good
pint
sweetness
is
fairly
restrained
just
enough
to
keep
krampus
from
being
a
mouth
puckering
paint
stripping
brain
numbing
hop
bomb
its
pretty
close
though
a
lager
to
vie
with
unearthlys
ale
outlook
i
picked
up
a
22oz
bottle
poured
into
a
snifter
glass
pours
an
amberdark
orange
sort
of
color
with
thick
head
leaves
lots
of
bubbly
on
the
side
of
the
glass
my
initial
reaction
to
the
aroma
was
whoa
real
sharp
aroma
full
of
hops
and
pine
i
smell
a
bit
of
citrus
in
there
as
well
smooth
mouthfeel
without
a
lot
of
fizz
mild
stickiness
smells
sharper
than
it
tastes
the
taste
is
real
hoppy
at
first
but
settles
down
into
sweet
malt
and
bitterness
i
cant
really
taste
the
alcohol
but
i
drink
this
having
just
run
five
miles
and
i
definitely
feel
the
alcohol
overall
i
like
this
a
lot
this
is
the
first
beer
of
this
style
that
i
have
ever
tried
so
i
dont
really
have
anything
to
compare
it
to
its
an
enjoyable
beer
to
drink
though
and
i
will
be
buying
more
drinkability
this
is
one
weird
fuckin
beer
imperial
helles
lager
that
smells
like
pliny
the
elder
minus
the
malt
very
strange
and
very
interesting
recommended
highly
if
only
because
its
absolutely
strange
m
d
a
little
bit
heavier
with
a
good
chewiness
i
almost
feel
like
i
can
bite
into
this
a
big
sipper
and
a
fine
option
when
in
the
mood
for
a
big
hoppy
brew
ill
be
happy
to
revisit
this
one
a
couple
times
over
this
season
new
style
for
me
quite
suprised
by
flavor
will
have
this
one
again
mediocre
too
hoppy
for
a
refreshing
lager
not
hoppy
enough
for
a
satisfying
ipa
its
a
very
good
india
pale
lager
presentation
packaged
in
a
twelve
ounce
short
brown
glass
bottle
with
a
twistoff
crown
served
in
a
new
belgium
brewing
chalice
overall
this
is
one
tasty
brew
at
a
fantastic
price
i
really
liked
the
unique
blend
of
hop
that
blended
very
nicely
with
the
lager
body
very
nice
overall
not
bad
at
all
it
certainly
surpassed
my
expectations
only
downside
is
the
body
which
is
more
ipalike
than
lagerlike
not
a
huge
issue
but
if
i
were
looking
for
something
more
light
and
refreshing
in
the
summer
id
likely
grab
something
else
an
enjoyable
rendition
of
this
burgeoning
protostyle
the
hoppiness
not
overbearing
but
working
well
with
the
choice
of
peppy
malts
good
on
pyramid
for
branching
out
a
bit
and
venturing
down
different
roads
id
like
to
see
more
of
this
sort
of
thing
ipls
that
is
done
well
of
course
a
citrusy
sharp
finish
distinctly
lemony
with
a
long
bitter
aftertaste
from
the
22
oz
bottle
purchased
at
the
market
in
anacortes
its
a
nice
lager
with
some
extra
citrus
and
pine
flavors
22

a
local

nice

is
fine
medium

and
medium

drinks
real
well
overall
really
nice
little
amber
lager
here
not
bad
at
all
i
find
myself
saying
that
often
with
pyramid
nowadays
incidentally
i
had
a
hard
time
nailing
down
the
style
for
the
add
beer
function
i
dont
think
double
or
imperial
is
an
apt
name
for
a
6
0
abv
brew
but
the
discussion
forums
led
me
there
i
also
could
not
load
a
picture
no
matter
how
many
times
i
tried
much
too
sweet
and
sticky
for
a
lager
even
if
it
is
an
imperial
beer
the
color
alone
was
telling
of
how
much
malt
was
laid
down
in
this
beer
rather
easy
to
drink
once
you
dismiss
this
as
a
lager
fresh
bottle
from
texas
liquor
in
carsblad
cal
very
easy
to
drink
hoppy
beer
an
understated
bitterness
that
was
most
pleasant
during
a
long
luncheon
mild
hoppy
aromas
some
citrus
medium
mouthfeel
and
onequarter
inch
of
retained
head
on
cloudy
lightly
orange
body
satisfying
not
heavy
sure
not
a
double
ipa
and
cannot
be
held
up
to
that
sort
of
hop
assault
definitely
wont
be
trying
this
beer
again
o
overall
a
below
average
pilsner
somewhat
bland
and
reminded
me
a
little
bit
of
an
american
adjunct
lager
wouldnt
really
seek
it
out
again
taste
is
nice
spicy
flowery
citrusy
hop
bitterness
with
sweetish
bread
honey
apple
along
with
mineral
it
has
a
lot
of
wellrounded
balanced
character
nice
malt
and
hop
presence
lively
and
zesty
some
day
overall
i
have
never
been
thrilled
by
the
imperial
pilsner
style
more
because
i
dislike
the
malt
character
of
so
many
of
them
in
this
case
i
really
like
the
malts
but
the
hops
arent
up
to
the
task
still
it
is
easy
to
drink
o
an
amazing
beer
liked
this
more
than
i
originally
thought
i
would
i
had
this
in
my
fridge
for
quite
a
while
and
now
wish
i
would
have
drank
it
sooner
as
we
all
do
with
unknowingly
amazing
brews
super
excited
to
find
this
randomly
while
shopping
at
certain
markets
although
availability
here
in
socal
should
be
a
little
better
for
this
considering
i
live
2
or
3
counties
away
look
for
it
at
your
bottle
shop
its
a
must
for
sdagans
overall
this
is
just
an
ok
beer
its
not
bad
but
i
really
dont
think
i
will
buy
another
bottle
overall
this
is
a
good
benchmark
for
the
style
not
good
and
not
bad
and
worth
a
shot
pours
to
a
light
orange
with
a
white
foam
head
at
first
sip
you
can
taste
the
higher
hops
than
with
other
pilsners
taste
is
somewhat
grassy
with
a
hoppy
yet
not
overpowering
finish
foam
dissapears
quickly
but
the
aftertaste
on
this
beer
is
not
that
bitter
and
makes
your
pallate
desire
another
sip
at
7
5
and
with
a
22
oz
bottle
it
might
still
be
considered
a
session
beer
that
one
can
enjoy
when
looking
for
a
beer
to
stick
with
and
not
have
it
overpower
you
pours
a
hazy
light
orange
with
a
1
inch
whiteorange
head
that
fades
to
a
small
cap
random
spotting
and
splotches
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smells
of
toasted
malt
grassy
notes
and
herbal
hops
taste
is
of
toasted
malt
bread
and
grassyherbal
hops
there
is
also
a
definite
alcohol
flavor
with
this
beer
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
thick
and
sticky
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
and
the
first
of
the
style
i
have
had
however
i
am
not
too
sure
i
would
get
this
one
again
pours
a
clear
light
apricot
color
with
a
thin
white
head
that
quickly
falls
down
into
a
few
bubbles
thin
collar
throughout
the
nose
is
lightly
grainy
without
too
much
depth
some
bready
malt
and
not
much
in
the
way
of
hops
the
flavor
is
bready
with
some
light
grain
in
the
background
hop
bitterness
comes
through
on
the
backend
though
isnt
really
present
in
the
flavor
medium
body
with
high
carbonation
and
a
bit
of
an
alcohol
bite
in
the
finish
decent
enough
though
not
my
favorite
malt
bomb
wins
ive
wrote
off
karl
strauss
beers
in
the
past
beers
with
little
character
but
a
recent
change
in
the
bottle
lineup
has
got
all
these
new
big
flavored
beers
on
the
market
and
after
trying
this
and
big
barrel
double
ipa
im
rethinking
how
i
view
karl
strauss
d
i
enjoyed
this
beer
quite
a
bit
its
easy
ti
drink
with
a
good
taste
to
it
this
was
a
good
take
on
the
style
worth
picking
up
sometime
drinkability
i
have
only
one
good
thing
to
say
about
this
beer
i
couldnt
stop
drinking
it
hahaha
when
i
pick
it
apart
its
hard
to
find
one
positive
quality
and
lord
knows
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
style
but
the
hell
with
all
that
for
some
strange
reason
it
hit
the
spot
overall
not
a
beer
id
pass
up
its
fairly
pleasant
but
ill
probably
forget
all
about
it
during
my
next
brew
serving
type
22
oz
bottle
picked
up
on
a
recent
trip
to
san
diego
pours
a
nice
goldenamber
color
with
a
fairly
substantial
rocky
white
head
good
breadybiscuity
aromas
with
a
just
a
hint
of
hops
solid
pilsner
character
on
the
palate
creamy
with
a
subtle
alcoholic
punch
near
the
end
good
this
is
an
imperial
czech
style
pilsner
it
has
a
pale
golden
hue
and
a
nice
head
retention
the
aromas
i
picked
up
were
grassy
and
floral
with
a
slight
hint
of
toasted
malt
slight
hope
character
however
not
too
prominent
bodymedium
standard
finishs
crisp
and
dry
a
bti
of
lingering
booziness
due
to
the
high
alcohol
content
overall
a
good
beer
and
in
my
opinion
a
nice
step
outside
of
the
traditional
box
the
slightly
roasted
hop
flavor
is
extremely
pleasant
to
me
doesnt
have
the
hypedup
malt
liquor
taste
of
some
imperial
pilseners
score
one
for
strauss
on
this
one
d
the
abv
is
rather
well
hidden
and
it
goes
down
way
too
easily
not
one
of
the
best
imperial
pilsners
ive
had
but
there
are
no
major
flaws
and
its
good
to
see
karl
strauss
taking
some
risks
with
their
bottled
offerings
d
quaffable
for
sure
d
not
a
bad
tasting
beer
but
the
shortness
of
the
flavor
baffled
me
im
not
sure
what
caused
that
but
it
at
least
made
this
beer
more
interesting
d
i
enjoyed
this
beer
quite
a
bit
not
a
lot
you
can
do
to
dry
out
an
imperial
pilsner
but
the
flavors
were
definitely
on
reminded
me
of
some
of
the
pilsners
ive
had
in
central
europe
i
wasnt
100
sold
but
definitely
enjoyed
this
beer
more
than
a
few
other
imp
pils
that
ive
tried
worth
a
shot
especially
as
the
weather
heats
up
d
this
is
ok
pils
cant
hide
the
problems
and
this
has
its
fair
share
a
good
impy
pils
has
the
strong
hop
character
checked
by
the
malt
everything
is
in
a
balance
i
dont
see
a
balance
here
and
the
flavours
arent
particularly
good
drinkability
this
was
the
best
stab
at
a
czechstyle
pilsner
that
ive
tried
strong
recommendation
pours

that
slowly

to

that

the

to
a

with

o
tjis
beer
had
the
bready
malt
aromas
and
flavors
as
one
would
expect
from
the
style
but
it
seems
like
the
high
amounts
of
malts
pushed
this
beyond
the
typical
flavors
that
one
would
expect
from
the
style
which
normally
is
not
sweet
overall
though
im
not
quite
sure
i
get
the
point
a
pils
can
be
a
wonderful
beer
expression
and
an
imperial
one
in
my
opinion
should
just
accentuate
the
hops
the
structure
of
the
malt
while
maintaining
that
crispness
this
has
something
of
the
crispness
but
almost
nothing
of
the
flavour
not
poorly
made
just
boring
o
good
for
the
style
but
nothing
to
particularly
write
home
about
i
would
drink
this
again
if
i
was
looking
for
something
drinkable
on
a
hot
day
but
not
something
that
i
would
go
for
in
sessions
overall
not
something
id
crave
but
paired
well
with
the
applewood
bacon
blt
i
had
it
with
would
pair
well
with
lightly
flavored
pizzas
lemoncitrus
grilled
chicken
or
a
good
blt
as
i
had
i
was
surprised
by
this
one
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
going
in
but
i
walked
away
happy
i
picked
this
one
up
aside
from
the
warming
bite
of
alcohols
presence
everything
else
highly
enjoyable
the
beer
is
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
fizzy
white
head
that
slowly
recedes
light
spots
of
lacing
stick
to
the
glass
initially
the
aroma
has
a
faint
notion
of
malts
before
really
getting
into
some
lemongrass
and
black
pepper
notably
the
taste
is
like
the
aroma
in
that
a
real
black
pepper
body
takes
over
traces
of
banana
grains
and
saaz
hops
can
be
found
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
light
and
dry
overall
theres
a
bit
too
much
pepper
in
this
for
me
to
really
enjoy
overall
a
tasty
and
mild
beer
super
easy
to
drink

this

a
very
enjoyable

interestingly
spicy
the

seems
to
be
an
appropriate
choice
for
this
stronger
kind
of
brew
the
slightly
higher
abv
makes
for
pleasant
mouthful
with
all
the
malt
and
that
hoppy
tang
a
very
drinkable
and
flavorful
brew
that
keeps
the
bitterness
in
the
background
but
its
still
nicely
balanced
from
the
750
ml
bottle
bought
at
olive
tree
market
in
san
diego
for

this
imp
pilsner
is
stronger
and
more
yeasty
than
your
everyday
pilsner
but
retains
the
malty
base
saaz
hops
and
dry
crisp
finish
higher
abv
is
partially
hidden
o
a
solid
american
imperial
pilsner
an
easy
drinker
for
the
summer
months
that
provides
just
enough
kick
lager
fans
should
seek
this
one
out
o
i
would
have
this
again
if
it
were
shoved
in
front
of
my
face
but
wouldnt
actively
seek
it
out
very
pale
golden
colored
body
looked
very
much
like
a
typical
pilsner
but
the
carbonation
was
much
more
lively
and
made
it
look
like
a
club
soda
the
beer
initially
had
little
head
but
the
fizz
formed
it
soon
afterwards
the
smell
was
clean
and
malt
with
a
hint
of
grass
as
well
as
lemon
the
taste
was
much
more
intense
than
i
expected
with
a
flavors
of
of
honey
white
pepper
banana
bubblegum
and
a
hint
of
lavender
and
blonde
raisins
the
beer
was
light
in
the
mouth
and
had
a
peppery
aftertaste
this
was
definitely
quite
interesting
perhaps
there
was
something
wrong
with
the
co2
at
the
boulevard
booth
i
got
a
foamy
pour
but
this
tasted
godawful
somewhere
between
skunk
and
fecal
matter
im
a
big
fan
of
the
boulevard
ipa
so
maybe
ill
give
this
another
chance
but
for
now
the
worst
beer
ive
had
in
a
looong
time
o
not
a
bad
offering
little
note
of
the
extra
alcohol
in
the
imperial
it
seems
like
its
struggling
to
have
a
nice
hops
finish
and
comes
up
slightly
flat
overall
i
was
very
impressed
with
this
beer
was
surprised
to
see
some
of
the
lower
scores
on
this
one
will
definitely
get
again
seriously
i
drink
cause
it
makes
me
horney
and
this
beer
is
it
other
then
delirium
reverb
is
the
one
will
report
back
after
the
coitus
has
taken
place
backward
it
spells
brever
yeah
mindblow
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
brass
topped
by
a
finger
of
lightly
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
mild
biscuit
flowers
light
grass
and
wild
rice
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
along
with
a
strong
vein
of
straight
plastic
as
though
i
licked
the
cheap
bag
my
groceries
came
in
this
not
only
tastes
bad
on
its
own
but
it
also
mixes
strangely
with
the
breadiness
of
the
malt
leading
to
a
rather
offputting
flavor
on
my
tongue
the
body
is
a
lightleaning
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
drying
finish
overall
ive
been
searching
for
a
really
nice
impy
pils
and
thought
boulevard
would
be
the
brewery
to
deliver
it
alas
this
was
not
the
case
instead
theirs
stands
as
a
fairly
middling
version
at
best
ive
had
some
absolutely
horrid
ones
in
my
day
overall
pretty
good
pilsener
i
am
glad
i
tried
this
and
would
buy
it
again
if
the
price
is
right
o
very
good
pils
i
would
have
liked
it
more
bready
but
still
very
good
light
and
true
to
style
imperial
pilsner
s
can
vary
but
i
like
this
light
and
super
drinkable
boulevard
wish
i
could
remember
how
similar
this
might
be
to
the
collaboration
1
sweet
toasted
cracker
flavor
is
pretty
thin
strong
alcohol
presence
finish
is
a
bright
boozey
earth
flavor
toasty
malt
yeasty
dryness
boozey
warmth
throughout
not
bad
but
seems
like
a
par
beer
for
an
awesome
brewery
glad
i
tried
this
brew
though
ok
small
head
remains
aroma
of
wheat
grass
light
lemon
citrus
and
malt
full
flavors
of
lemon
grassy
hops
roasted
malts
some
bitter
notes
from
esters
and
hops
overall
rich
full
bodied
lots
of
grassy
hops
some
citrus
some
malts
decent
but
not
something
i
would
crave
this
is
a
great
pilsner
that
i
will
seek
out
next
summer
as
well
another
win
for
the
smokestack
series
b
83
o
good
beer
not
great
i
would
have
no
idea
that
this
imp
pilsner
is
7
7
id
drink
it
again
but
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
sharp
and
dry
finish
a
bit
boozy
very
nice
o
a
pilsner
with
a
lot
more
malt
than
normal
thats
it
its
a
pretty
onedimensional
drink
that
manages
to
hit
on
all
the
fundamentals
of
the
style
but
just
barely
for
the
priceperounce
its
pretty
good
but
i
doubt
ill
get
it
again
good
stuff
clean
flavors
solid
noble
hop
profile
full
pilsner
malt
backbone
with
good
carbonation
no
alcohol
presence
with
high
drinkabilty
makes
this
go
down
smooth
and
quick
o
this
beer
has
a
great
full
flavor
of
pils
malt
with
just
a
hint
of
sweetness
to
make
it
fresh
and
nice
full
rounded
hops
without
becoming
bitey
and
no
sulfur
harshness
either
o
a
nicely
done
imperial
pils
from
boulevard
a
nicely
done
imperial
pils
that
keeps
the
abv
under
control
while
emphasizing
excellent
pilsner
qualities
i
see
another
reviewer
called
for
this
to
become
a
regular
four
or
sixpack
release
from
boulevard
i
second
that
suggestion
mouthfeel
was
superb
very
soft
but
not
quite
imperial
it
was
a
bit
light
o
wonderful
as
a
pilsner
it
is
ok
as
an
imperial
pilsner
it
is
quite
delicious
and
what
i
imagine
it
should
be
i
could
easily
get
carried
away
with
this
as
it
hides
its
7
7
abv
well
pours
a
slightly
hazy
yellow
with
a
foamy
offwhite
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
grain
and
some
grassy
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
mild
hop
bitterness
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
is
pretty
tasty
but
somewhat
basic
overall
very
impressed
with
this
one
lots
of
fun
and
more
boulevard
win
too
o
this
is
a
nice
subtle
beer
that
somehow
works
a
great
grainy
hay
flavor
and
enough
hop
character
to
make
it
interesting
it
works
and
its
tasty
dont
pay
an
arm
and
a
leg
but
try
this
if
you
like
pilsners
overall
i
generally
do
not
like
this
style
but
like
boulevard
so
i
figured
i
would
give
this
a
try
the
problem
i
have
with
most
versions
of
the
style
is
that
the
way
breweries
imperialize
pilsners
is
by
adding
massive
amounts
of
hops
or
alcohol
when
that
happens
the
grassiness
and
some
of
the
refreshing
qualities
i
like
about
regular
pilsners
get
taken
away
boulevard
is
the
first
brewery
i
have
tasted
that
still
has
a
lot
of
the
pilsner
taste
i
like
in
their
imperial
version
the
alcohol
is
upped
but
i
do
not
feel
like
i
am
choking
on
it
this
is
a
very
good
beer
and
one
i
will
get
again
if
i
was
not
grading
to
style
it
is
probably
closer
to
a
4
but
it
blows
away
every
other
example
i
have
had
in
the
style
a
great
beer
overall
all
of
the
alcohol
is
masked
well
by
the
great
flavors
a
very
refreshing
treat
for
any
time
of
the
year
i
in
general
find
imperial
pilseners
to
be
a
style
thats
mostly
unnecessary
this
brew
reinforced
that
opinion
an
explosion
of
bubbles
fills
the
pilsner
glass
to
the
rim
and
continue
unabated
keeping
the
huge
white
head
in
full
effect
color
is
pale
yellow
with
golden
hues
smells
of
fresh
squeezed
lemon
grain
and
a
hint
of
grass
not
much
going
on
aroma
wise
flavorful
light
fruits
and
malt
are
quickly
followed
by
a
subdued
hoppiness
and
an
afterthought
of
caramel
a
bit
of
spice
lies
underneath
it
all
not
as
dry
as
expected
and
actually
has
quite
a
creamy
mouthfeel
the
alcohol
heat
tickles
the
throat
overall
this
one
is
quite
balanced
and
drinkable
and
while
im
not
the
biggest
imperial
pils
fan
im
thoroughly
enjoying
this
one
this
beer
comes
by
way
of
cpolking
thanks
poured
from
a
brown
25
4
oz
bottle
has
a
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
a
bit
malty
some
grains
taste
is
the
same
malts
and
grains
some
alcohol
is
present
just
a
faint
touch
of
hops
a
bit
mild
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
pretty
good
beer
the
reverb
as
compared
to
other
stack
series
is
not
amazing
however
it
is
still
a
very
smooth
beer
the
beer
poured
a
bright
clear
yellow
until
some
settlement
interrupted
the
astetics
the
head
start
nice
and
bubbly
then
dissappeared
the
smell
was
grainy
with
hints
of
saaz
the
taste
started
sweet
then
the
nice
maltgrain
balance
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
body
with
smooth
carbonation
overall
it
was
pretty
darn
good
o
wish
i
had
been
able
to
try
this
a
little
fresher
but
as
is
i
think
this
is
a
solid
beer
as
is
every
other
offering
from
the
smokestack
series
i
like
the
simplicity
of
the
single
hopsingle
malt
recipe
very
refreshing
and
worth
trying
overall
this
isnt
very
pilsnerlike
and
with
the
muted
hop
and
alcohol
not
very
imperial
but
i
would
say
it
is
a
tasty
beer
o
i
list
for
this
beer
its
so
balanced
fresh
and
complex
all
at
the
same
time
this
750
went
quick
i
want
to
grab
more
of
this
right
now
too
bad
its
too
late
oh
well
i
can
grab
more
in
a
few
days
and
you
can
be
sure
i
will
stop
what
your
doing
and
go
get
reverb
light
bodied
with
plenty
of
carbonation
crisp
clean
and
refreshing
a
nice
imperial
pilsner
worth
trying
if
you
have
the
chance
just
like
with
other
beers
in
the
smokestack
series
brilliantly
clear
gold
with
a
perfect
dollop
of
pure
white
foam
harmony
between
a
soft
clean
elegant
graininess
and
slightly
aggressive
saaz
honey
lemon
zest
black
pepper
and
barley
husk
great
balance
which
seems
to
be
difficult
to
achieve
in
this
style
great
flavors
but
what
really
makes
it
stand
out
is
that
the
brewers
managed
to
maintain
that
lean
pilsner
dryness
four
packs
of
this
would
be
nice
to
see
in
the
future
a
ramped
upampedup
version
of
their
pils
with
some
american
influence
i
like
this
would
love
to
see
this
out
in
4
pack
next
year
overall
pilsners
are
not
one
of
my
favorite
styles
of
beer
and
i
rarely
stop
and
buy
them
at
bottle
shops
i
have
to
say
that
this
would
be
best
to
have
on
a
hot
day
sitting
on
the
back
porch
barbequing
and
sharing
with
friends
i
did
enjoy
this
especially
when
i
got
to
the
second
half
of
the
750ml
bottle
it
was
nice
to
have
a
handcrafted
pilsner
for
a
change
brewed
with
quality
ingredients
this
is
definitely
a
giant
step
over
all
the
other
massively
produced
adjunct
brews
available
out
there
im
a
real
big
fan
of
boulevards
line
of
smokestack
series
beers
and
i
when
i
heard
that
they
were
going
to
make
an
imperial
pilsner
i
realized
that
i
havent
had
a
craft
brewed
pilsner
yet
and
i
just
had
to
purchase
a
bottle
and
give
it
a
chance
this
beer
was
well
crafted
and
moderately
wellbalanced
and
if
you
a
fan
of
pilsners
i
would
recommend
picking
this
up
while
its
sticking
around
and
still
fresh
o
glad
to
see
this
one
hit
the
shelves
again
under
a
different
name
id
love
to
try
this
on
draft
sometime
i
enjoyed
this
imperial
pilsner
quite
a
bit
will
definitely
have
again
overall
a
drinkable
refreshing
pilsner
well
done
boulevard
o
tasty
pumped
up
pilsner
this
is
the
first
smokestack
series
brew
i
havent
loved
to
death
its
good
it
just
sint
as
unique
and
standout
as
many
of
the
others
from
this
series
it
pours
an
almost
perfectly
clear
pale
straw
color
with
a
hint
of
that
yellow
5
mountain
dew
color
to
it
but
just
a
hint
a
frothy
two
inch
head
rests
on
top
the
smell
is
alcohol
right
from
the
get
go
a
grassy
hop
profile
and
some
crystal
and
pale
malts
are
also
present
in
to
nose
the
malts
seem
pretty
substantial
here
not
heavy
and
sweet
or
bready
but
just
providing
a
solid
backbone
for
the
brew
the
flavor
is
the
same
light
in
color
but
not
in
flavor
the
malts
are
dominant
the
alcohol
wins
though
which
i
think
is
a
detractor
overall
it
just
kind
of
trumps
what
would
be
very
interesting
flavors
the
feel
is
good
though
perfect
carbonation
for
the
beer
and
a
lighter
than
medium
body
its
drinkable
just
not
supremely
delicious
overall
a
letdown
from
the
smokestack
standards
but
dont
let
that
dissuade
you
its
a
well
made
beer
with
a
nice
punch
o
all
of
boulevards
seasonals
are
worth
trying
the
smokestack
seasonals
and
their
heritage
seasonals
seek
them
out
you
will
not
be
disappointed
o
this
is
very
good
often
imperial
pilsners
are
too
sweet
or
too
boozy
this
is
not
the
case
with
reverb
good
balance
drink
i
thought
this
would
be
a
couple
things
1
a
little
crisper
and
cleaner
and
2
i
just
thought
would
be
overall
better
overall
this
is
certainly
a
brew
worth
trying
solid
taste
good
for
almost
any
occasion
pretty
expensive
though
but
a
good
beer
nonetheless
im
not
a
huge
pilsner
fan
but
i
love
boulevard
brewery
so
i
knew
i
was
going
to
try
this
good
for
the
style
but
not
my
favorite
style
take
it
or
leave
it
if
you
like
pilsners
id
be
surprised
if
you
didnt
like
this
overall
this
is
a
very
good
imperial
pilsner
its
tasty
refreshing
and
nuanced
it
shouldnt
have
replaced
the
worldclass
two
jokers
by
any
means
but
reverb
is
a
beer
that
im
glad
exists
overall
ok
but
not
really
meant
to
exist
i
do
love
dfh
experimenting
and
sam
is
such
an
awesome
guy
but
this
one
wasnt
quite
there
the
lager
yeast
was
just
not
meant
to
make
a
beer
this
big
overall
a
pretty
interesting
and
solid
twist
on
a
pilsner
it
comes
across
like
a
barleywine
with
its
big
balanced
blend
of
malt
and
hops
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
brew
although
i
believe
i
overpaid
given
the
price
point
nonetheless
i
a
m
glad
i
gave
it
a
shot
i
love
the
idea
i
dont
like
the
beer
10
grains
10
hops
10
percent
beer
thousand
and
it
comes
with
music
all
good
things
the
beer
though
is
pretty
bad
it
smells
like
a
can
of
high
gravity
homeless
beer
steel
reserve
or
something
sweet
and
corny
and
adjuncty
and
boozy
in
all
the
wrong
ways
pilsener
types
that
get
this
strong
are
always
a
little
disagreeable
to
me
so
maybe
that
is
part
of
it
but
this
is
easily
the
worst
dogfish
beer
i
can
remember
its
bright
in
color
crystal
clear
and
with
a
little
orange
to
its
color
well
carbonated
and
relatively
heady
but
the
attraction
stops
at
the
appearance
it
smells
so
sugary
and
tinny
and
the
taste
is
the
same
with
the
booze
so
exposed
it
almost
hurts
it
was
hard
not
to
dump
this
and
i
may
have
if
it
wasnt
for
thebrewo
pushing
me
though
it
refusing
to
drainpour
anything
very
little
redeemable
about
this
one
unless
you
are
looking
for
a
quick
and
easy
buzz
less
calories
and
a
nasty
hangover
no
thanks
great
taste
easy
to
drink
very
unique
beer
love
it
meh
not
anything
special
but
ok
skunky
aroma
honey
finish
sticky
mouthfeel
a
decent
enough
beer
but
when
i
want
to
drink
a
pils
a
beer
with
a
10
abv
is
just
not
what
im
looking
for
will
likely
not
be
visiting
this
one
again
extremely
smooth
ipl
good
melon
taste
high
abv
but
doesnt
factor
in
the
taste
at
all
overall
a
fantastic
ipl
not
very
fragrant
only
issue
j
overall
as
good
as
it
tastes
it
is
simply
not
enough
to
make
you
want
to
think
this
is
the
best
lager
you
ever
had
very
good
but
there
are
some
european
counterparts
that

12
oz
bottled
on
103114
complexity
with
10
grains
and
10
hops
but
i
like
the
booziness
the
booze
was
strong
but
not
terribly
noticeable
thankfully
this
was
an
imperial
pilsner
stylistically
but
when
it
came
to
the
taste
and
body
there
was
just
too
much
going
on
here
for
this
to
fall
nearly
into
that
category
its
been
a
while
since
i
had
a
beer
that
tailed
off
from
the
initial
sip
to
the
aftertaste
that
lingered
but
that
was
the
case
here
props
to
dogfish
head
for
going
outside
of
the
norm
with
this
but
i
wasnt
quite
feeling
it
and
can
only
hope
that
beer
two
thousand
stands
a
bit
more
above
the
crowd
when
it
comes
out
d
not
bad
but
needs
some
fine
tuning
turned
off
by
the
dms
and
seems
like
it
could
have
been
a
little
more
fine
tuned
before
publishing
pretty
good
for
a
pilsner
fantastic
beer
its
10
and
incredibly
smooth
and
i
didnt
even
age
this
the
best
lager
i
have
ever
had
period
if
the
american
macro
lagers
could
take
note
lager
wouldnt
be
such
a
bad
word
top
ten
beer
of
all
time
serving
type
bottle
golden
good
head
retention
and
some
lacing
smelled
of
apples
and
pears
to
me
tasted
a
little
of
the
same
enjoyed
the
abv
it
added
to
the
flavors
this
one
was
interesting
strong
citrus
on
the
aroma
with
hints
of
malt
shining
through
taste
is
that
of
citrus
and
sweet
fruit
pine
and
grains
along
with
moderate
alcohol
presence
moderate
body
and
smooth
carbonation
lend
to
a
pleasant
drinking
experience
great
head
retention
nice
lacing
on
the
side
of
the
glass
smelled
very
subtle
tasted
like
apple
pear
but
hit
a
note
of
wax
on
the
end
finished
okay
but
wont
be
drinking
this
again
just
didnt
work
for
me
had
this
for
from
a
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
good
beer
great
color
and
head
i
expected
more
aroma
and
flavor
after
the
hype
it
was
a
bit
of
a
let
down
i
have
a
750ml
cellared
hopefully
it
will
age
well
and
bring
out
something
it
was
missing
the
first
time
around
drinkability
overall
i
was
really
impressed
with
this
one
first
off
i
love
the
packaging
i
paid
22
99
for
the
box
set
and
felt
it
was
well
worth
the
money
especially
with
the
vinyl
and
i
wasnt
even
expecting
another
22oz
bomber
of
the
beer
in
this
box
set
which
really
made
happy
when
i
opened
it
up
i
love
the
idea
of
dfh
going
against
the
grain
to
use
10
different
hops
and
10
different
grains
to
make
a
lager
that
has
some
actual
character
the
crispness
of
its
mouth
feel
paired
with
the
nice
apple
and
honey
elements
with
a
healthy
kick
of
booze
on
the
end
makes
this
beer
a
stand
out
an
excellent
effort
from
sam
and
the
boys
down
in
coastal
delaware
feel
near
medium

with
mediumhigh

warmth
and
mild
harshness
overall
another
fine
dfh
they
seem
to
be
out
of
favor
a
bit
for
some
reason
but
continue
to
deliver
pours
a
three
finger
white
head
that
fades
quickly
to
a
ring
leaving
some

clear

me
10

varieties
x
10

all
cancelled
each

out
to
create
an

that
resembles
steel

thousand
yields
a
fluffy
white

and
a
golden
pilsner
color
nose
of
a

diesel
tastes
like
a
boozy
lager
with
a
metallic
aftertaste
it
goes
down
easier
than
it
should
for
a
10
abv
brew
but
after
the
pour
and
nose
the
overall
beer
slid
down
towards
regular
pilsner
status
it
has
the
makings
of
greatness
but
fell
short
and
needs
to
be
tweaked
a
little
to
right
the
ship
a
fairly
significant
miss
from
dogfish
head
which
is
a
shame
theyve
put
out
a
lot
of
stuff
that
ive
liked
o
er
so
i
like
that
its
a
pilsner
because
thats
in
line
with
gbv
but
all
these
different
hops
and
grains
arent
beneficial
its
even
hard
to
say
whether
theyre
showing
up
here
at
all
at
10
with
whacko
malt
liquor
and
generic
lager
flavors
floatin
about
its
pretty
much
a
mess
actually
thats
in
line
with
gbv
too
maybe
theyre
onto
something
here
either
way
sorry
dogfish
this
one
is
yours
to
keep

having

great
job
on
this

awesome
negative

positive
the
abv
was
pretty
well
hidden
one
and
done
on
this
way
too
sweet
barely
noticed
any
hop
bitterness
for
having
10
hops
well
hidden
10
abv
overall
the
alcohol
kind
of
dominates
the
taste
its
a
decent
beer
but
nothing
special
poured
a
clear
golden
body
with
a
large
frothy
head
that
dies
slow
and
leaves
foamy
lace
around
glass
a
grassy
citric
hop
aroma
along
with
a
little
bit
of
sweetness
both
of
the
hop
grape
like
and
malt
honey
i
guess
variety
seems
to
be
a
little
dislike
for
this
beer
but
i
found
it
not
only
an
easy
drinking
beer
but
one
that
is
pretty
good
dont
know
if
i
had
a
freshly
tapped
keg
made
a
big
difference
smooth
easy
to
drink
light
to
medium
body
with
wellhidden
abv
i
like
the
pils
like
grassy
earthy
hop
feel
and
light
sweetness
with
some
breadiness
to
add
balance
and
a
crisp
dry
finish
not
for
everyone
but
if
you
like
a
decent
nontraditional
pils
to
relax
with
you
cant
beat
this

little
boozy

overall
its
a

better
than
most
pilsners
but
nothing
to
call
home
about
i
like
my
pilsners
to
be
clean
and
light
so
that
i
can
session
the
hell
out
of
them
at
10
this
is
not
one
you
could
do
that
with
its
a

in
an
ocean
of

floral

not
dry
or
bitter
classic
look
and
feel
very
creative
taste
while
still
maintaining
the
pilsner
mindset
little
syrupy
afterburner
interesting
whew
my
expectations
were
high
for
this
one
i
was
thinking
something
along
the
lines
of
an
amped
up
my
antonia
that
didnt
pan
out
tasted
like
budweiser
to
me
dogfish
head
beer
thousand
35
o
other
than
some
off
the
initial

aroma
this
was
a
pleasant
ip
would
like
to
do
a
side
by
side
with
my
antonia
swing
and
a
miss
smelled
a
bit
off
and
tasted
downright
caustic
taste
hides
its
alcohol
very
well
bread
lemongrass
sweet
grain
and
light
fruit
despite
high
abv
this
is
very
easy
to
drink
a
nice
potent
pils
very
good
taste
a
bit
of
a
malt
finish
which
i
didnt
expect
i
wish
this
wasnt
a
limited
release
overall
drinks
a
bit
like
a
chardonnay
though
with
a
thicker
body
its
good
but
im
a
bit
confused
about
its
purpose
if
i
wanted
white
wine
id
go
get
a
white
wine
i
was
hoping
for
something
more
akin
to
beer
this
isnt
the
first
dfh
beer
ive
had
that
wished
it
were
a
wine
and
im
guessing
it
wont
be
the
last
overall
one
hell
of
a
beer
from
dfh
incredibly
complex
the
name
is
perfect
for
this
beer
10
grains
and
10
hops
enough
said
furthermore
ive
never
had
a
beer
this
light
in
body
with
so
much
alcohol
it
burns
after
its
down
but
not
easily
felt
to
the
palate
but
way
complex
so
much
maltsweetnesshop
flavors
going
on
it
really
is
unfortunate
this
is
a
one
time
offering
it
should
be
available
year
round
as
it
is
excellent
mouthfeel
is
thick
sticky
chewy
overall
tasty
beer
interesting
if
youre
seeking
a
big
pils
this
will
do
i
thought
i
hated
the
idea
of
an
imperial
pilsner
but
this
was
great
not
too
boozy
distinctive
lager
taste
i
wouldnt
hesitate
to
have
another
merry
christmas
im
drunk
deep
gold
to
light
brown
in
color
a
fingernail
of
off
white
head
covers
most
of
the
top
i
smell
a
very
light
malt
forward
body
theres
a
coppery
note
in
there
this
is
almost
a
light
barleywine
in
taste
the
mouth
is
thick
and
carbonated
unique
and
a
very
tasty
beer
not
a
bad
beer
if
you
like
fruity
malt
beers
the
alcohol
in
the
nose
seemed
to
add
an
detracting
note
to
this
beer
on
top
of
a
missing
bitterness
while
i
would
sip
this
beer
if
offered
to
me
i
wont
seek
it
out
pours
golden
with
a
creamy
head
of
foam
that
lasts
well
perfect
color
dark
like
a
good
pils
with
some
bubbles
coming
up
to
show
themselves
off
sweet
malt
on
the
nose
and
herbal
hops
smells
really
good
actually
has
a
freshness
to
the
scent
sweet
citrus
peel
backing
on
the
nose
really
floral
hops
are
devilishly
sweet
on
this
nose
i
like
it
a
lot
taste
is
really
well
done
has
a
good
crisp
carbonation
and
a
firm
malt
base
grainy
it
has
a
citrus
fruitiness
on
a
floral
hops
good
lager
the
ten
percent
is
not
a
hindrance
to
the
taste
of
the
beer
it
does
add
a
bit
of
bitterness
and
bite
to
the
drink
but
pleasant
hops
are
dank
and
live
up
to
the
abv
well
done
dry
too
and
crisp
in
the
finish
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
shaker
pint
the
beer
is
a
bright
vibrant
straw
gold
coloring
with
a
steady
flow
of
carbonation
and
a
filmy
sparse
white
surface
coat
aromas
of
subtle
resinous
hops
subtle
tropical
fruit
sweetness
tangy
caramel
and
biscuit
in
the
backbone
and
some
herbal
and
floral
highlights
flavors
are
rich
and
heavy
forward
with
a
solid
caramel
and
candi
sugar
blast
immediately
followed
by
a
warming
ribbon
of
booze
the
hops
are
there
but
seem
slightly
outmatched
subtle
bitterness
with
a
toasted
grain
backbone
the
body
is
heavy
robust
and
slick
and
the
carbonation
fights
to
keep
some
lightness
to
the
body
sugary
sweet
and
heavily
toasted
aftertaste
with
a
building
booze
warmth
smooth
slightly
dry
finish
big

great
american

exceptionally
drinkable
for
a

lager
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
with
sugary
malts
coming
through
a
lot
but
the
hop
presence
is
enjoyable
if
some
of
the
sweetness
was
gone
this
one
could
be
really
good
although
i
picked
up
no
notable
booze
on
the
nose
i
get
a
lot
more
of
it
burning
into
my
throat
along
with
a
vigorous
grainy
character
and
a
big
bitter
bite
to
finish
had
to
at
least
give
this
one
a
try
so
i
figured
id
get
a
bottle
rather
than
dedicate
myself
to
a
full
glass
on
tap
at
a
bar

you
would
be
hardpressed
to
notice
tmo
taste
is
definitely
a
lot
packed
in
there
but
again
if
i
had
to
pick
out
a
flavor
or
vibe
it
would
be
a
soft
grape
on
a
stack
of
grains
comes
across
a
bit
pilsner
like
full
bodied
and
has
some
boozy
sweetness
muddled
finish
and
a
lingering
aftertaste
has
a
dfh
vibe
but
fairly
refined
and
not
syrupy
overall
worth
checking
out
if
you
dig
dfh
and
or

could
be

good
job
to
dfh
havent
been
disappointed
in
my
local
brewery
this
is
a
strong
lager
that
is
well
made
the
10
malts
and
10
may
not
be
apparent
in
the
taste
but
you
get
the
feeling
it
is
a
bruiser
even
though
the
lagering
has
given
some
smoothness
with
very
mild
hop
flavor
with
focus
more
on
the
herbal
and
nobletype
flavors
there
is
a
mild
pilsner
quality
with
gentle
yeast
in
the
taste
adding
a
little
breadiness
but
alcohol
is
subdued
and
finish
is
relatively
dry
which
is
pleasant
overall
i
consider
one
of
the
better
examples
of
this
style

you
could
get
yourself
into
trouble
lol
with
beer
is
simple
and
worth
having
nothing
is
bold
in
this
beer
its
very
weighted
which
is
cool
to
say
it
simply
sweet
bready
carbonated
light
colored
tasty
champagne
feel
type
of
beer
its
cool
i
am
down
with
it
i
am
feeling
the
alcohol
as
we
speak
it
creeps
on
you
because
it
does
not
drink
like
its
alcohol
content
i
would
buy
it
mhmm
it
has
that
dogfish
feel
to
it
drink
it
while
eating
a
white
pizza
they
compliment
each
other
very
nicely
cheers
overly
sweet
seems
like
it
is
verging
on
a
barleywine
style
but
without
the
depth
and
complexity
i
would
expect
from
a
true
barleywine
big
and
hot
but
overly
sweet
and
lacking
in
any
real
depth
great
combination
of
flavor
color
smoth
off
the
palate
does
not
jump
out
and
give
you
that
kick
some
higher
abvs
give
but
taste
is
good
and
is
a
nice
alternative
to
have
around
in
my
beer
rotation
this
brewery
has
great
consistent
brews
and
this
one
is
right
up
ther
too
love
this
brewery
but
this
beer
tastes
like
a
40
oz
its
all
booze
with
nothing
else
to
balance
out
its
bite
very
disappointing
crystal
clear
deep
golden
color
with
a
decent
sized
tightly
bubbled
white
head
that
dissipates
rather
quickly
aromas
of
light
fruit
and
a
weird
oxidative
smell
thats
somewhere
between
sherry
and
plastic
some
yeasty
aromas
and
light
bready
malt
the
flavor
is
a
bit
fruity
tart
with
light
berry
and
hop
bitterness
light
alcohol
flavor
and
light
warming
this
one
has
a
lot
going
on
probably
too
much
and
unfortunately
the
flavors
arent
meshing
very
well
poured
into
a
blanche
de
namur
small
pint
glass
pours
a
light
to
medium
golden
amber
with
a
thin
slightly
offwhite
head
that
dissipates
quickly
to
patches
leaving
light
lacing
aroam
of
bready
malt
with
hints
of
caramel
apple
and
light
fruit
mild
grassy
hops
flavor
is
sweet
bready

grains
light
apple
and
pear
light
floral
and
grassy
hops
becomes
sweeter
before
finishing
with
a
semisweet
bready
maltiness
with
spicy
hops
and
light
lingering
hop
bitterness
medium
bodied
more
dense
mouth
feel
than
expected
from
the
color
a
subtly
flavored
sweet
imperial
pilsner
perhaps
a
bit
underwhelming
but
the
flavor
is
smooth
and
balanced
throughout
nice
finish
kind
of
what
id
expect
a
domestic
lager
on
steroids
to
taste
like
nothing
stands
out
moderately
sweet
and
pleasant
it
is
hard
to
believe
it
is
so
modestly
flavored
yet
the
abv
is
totally
covered
interesting
experience
one
of
the
less
envelope
pushing
dogfish
head
beers
but
as
usual
an
experience
worth
having
second
time
was
the
charm
the
first
time
i
had
this
i
was
totally
unimpressed
this
time
around
i
was
much
more
impressed
way
more
balance
subdued
alcohol
and
a
very
pleasant
overall
flavor
definitely
way
more
interesting

time

but
it
really
didnt
do
anything
for
me
worth
a
try
once
but
im
not
sure
if
id
pick
this
up
again
in
the
future
ive
never
been
much
of
a
fan
of
the
imperial
pilsner
and
this
beer
isnt
going
to
change
my
mind
its
not
much
more
than
a
glorified
malt
liquor
i
love
dfh
but
they
can
be
hit
or
miss
i
consider
this
one
a
miss
its
just
not
an
appealing
beer
and
its
not
fun
to
drink
meh
overall
muddled
confused
they
made
it
to
their
destination
of
combining
10
malts
and
10
hops
into
a
beer
thats
10
abv
only
to
find
that
theyve
ended
up
in
the
middle
of
nowhere
i
cant
really
respect
this
type
of
brewing
its
kind
of
like
looking
in
a
mirror
while
walking
backwards
to
see
where
youre
going
id
rather
focus
on
where
i
want
to
go
rather
than
the
things
i
want
to
pack
to
make
the
journey
the
spicy
taste
of
hops
and
alcohol

interesting
a

unique
bold
very
satisfying
has
the
crisp
and
subtle
characteristics
of
a
pilsner
but
the
big
flavors
of
an
imperial
brew
o
dfh
has
managed
to
brew
a
beer
that
minces
no
words
and
is
a
true
lager
worthy
of
the
imperial
title
complexity
is
there
if
you
search
for
it
but
it
is
what
it
is
nothing
more
nothing
less
being
that
one
of
my
favorite
beers
is
the
seasonal
czech
yourself
pilz
imperial
pilsner
from
the
c
h
evans
brewery
aka
albany
pump
station
i
was
excited
to
try
this
being
that
beer
thousand
has
a
slightly
more
corny
sweetness
i
will
give
a
nod
to
the
pump
station
not
for
everyone
but
if
you
want
to
know
what
a
lager
can
be
clocking
in
10abv
look
no
farther
than
this
limited
offering
from
the
trendbending
brewery
check
it
out
while
you
can
4
25
o
an
interesting
beer
thats
definitely
sweet
from
all
of
the
malt
additions
the
hops
were
rather
muted
considering
they
used
10
different
varieties
worth
a
try
but
nothing
mind
blowing
a
big
lagerlooking
heavyearth
grainbomb
if
that
sounds
good
this
is
for
you
boozy
malty
low
hop
flavors
ill
stick
with
my
antonia
a
soso
lager
that
lacks
balance
primarily
being
overly
sweet
especially
at
the
finish
the
hop
bitterness
and
alcohol
heat
also
standout
but
not
in
a
good
way
unbalanced
and
heavy
hitting
10
grains
yep
overly
sweet
10
hops
where
no
perceptible
hop
taste
in
the
bottle
i
tried
it
is
a
lagered
beer
so
consider
it
to
be
sweetened
corona
without
the
skunk
flavor
no
perceptible
alcohol
either
it
tasted
like
unfermented
wort
rather
than
beer
a
pilsner
is
supposed
to
have
a
crisp
clean
taste
either
i
got
a
batch
that
was
not
properly
fermented
or
dfh
is
just
putting
out
more
crappy
beer
avoid
this
drain
pour
overall
this
beer
has
some
good
tastes
and
quality
but
the
overall
combination
doesnt
quite
meld
well
the
sweet
qualities
come
over
a
little
to
strong
and
way
out
balance
the
hops
worth
a
try
to
any
fan
of
dogfish
head
beers
or
for
the
music
aspect
but
not
by
a
long
shot
a
must
get
o
surprisingly
drinkable
for
being
10
with
plenty
of
the
usual
lager
tendencies
very
grainy
and
malt
forward
with
the
hops
playing
a
very
modest
supporting
role
nice
to
sip
on
and
enjoy
generally
not
a
fan
of
this
style
aroma
is
corn
adjunct
along
with
floral
esters
perfume
and
fruity
notes
flavor
is
sweet
and
hot
reminiscent
of
malt
liquor
with
contrasting
sharp
citrus
notes
i
just
cant
help
the
feeling
of
needing
a
brown
bag
whenever
i
drink
an
imperial
pilsner
lacks
the
bitter
finish
and
crisp
character
of
a
true
pilsner
after
my
first
sip
i
thought
what
is
this
by
golly
it
a
lager
been
drinking
so
many
ipas
dipas
stouts
ales
i
almost
forgot
what
a
lager
tastes
like
but
a
little
different
than
a
straight
ahead
lager
its
crisp
and
drinkable
but
im
not
in
a
hurry
to
have
another
overall
this
is
a
pretty
interesting
beer
but
not
quite
at
the
level
of
the
bells
10000
i
would
definitely
recommend
getting
this
beer
when
possible
and
enjoying
it
it
may
be
a
bit
weird
but
dogfish
head
has
always
been
a
brewery
for
offcentered
people
a
very
good
beer
looks
and
smells
amazing
tastes
pretty
good
and
the
math
certainty
works
but
it
also
could
be
a
lot
better
evil
power
as
far
as
ive
tasted
is
the
goldstandard
for
the
imperial
pilsner
and
there
are
some
other
truly
excellent
huge
highabv
lagers
emerging
in
this
genre
this
unfortunately
is
a
tier
belowthough
with
strengths
oddly
besidethose
instantiations
not
my
cup
of
tea
or
beer
for
that
matter
well
crafted
as
this
is
smooth
as
hell
even
with
the
kickin
abv
but
i
am
just
not
digging
on
this
is
this
the
best
pilsner
ive
ever
had
probably
but
for
me
saying
best
pilsner
is
ultimately
akin
to
saying
best
billy
joel
album
or
best
prostate
exam
but
kudos
to
dfh
for
trying
bottle
pours
a
clear
orange
color
with
a
mild
head
rings
of
lacing
aroma
is
very
floral
and
perfumey
it
is
also
very
grainy
a
bit
of
honey
some
booze
in
the
nose
flavor
is
well
balanced
and
sneaky
with
the
alcohol
floral
hops
are

pale

anything
not

like
a
really
well
malt
malt
liquor
i
was
tentative
to
buy
a
four
pack
but
they
seem
to
be
disappearing
quickly
better
than
expected
id
say
its
broadly
in
the
maibock
in
style
sometimes
im
getting
glimpses
of
the
old
sn
glissade
due
to
the
hops
but
there
are
so
many
other
flavors
and
aromas
that
its
become
something
unto
itself
that
something
that
is
hard
to
grasp
also
makes
it
easy
to
like
but
hard
to
love
in
my
experience
worth
a
try
though
its
a
kicked
up
pilsner
finishes
very
clean
with
almost
no
flavor
that
hangs
around
kind
of
a
cardboard
after
taste
dry
little
to
no
sweetness
overall
an
interesting
if
not
a
little
gimmicky
kind
of
beer
overall
this
beer
is
a
very
enjoyable
it
pretty
much
lives
up
to
its
concept
as
a
very
intense
version
of
a
basic
lager
and
really
works
as
a
liquid
companion
to
one
of
the
best
indie
rock
albums
ever
bee
thousand
overall
not
terribly
complex
but
still
tasty
its
basically
just
a
plain
run
of
the
mill
lager
with
the
volume
turned
way
the
hell
up
if
that
sounds
like
your
kind
of
thing
then
you
should
pick
this
one
up
overall
a
real
unique
creation
and
still
maintains
some
lager
roots
with
so
much
complexity
and
diversity
going
on
this
could
be
the
india
pale
lager
to
set
the
benchmark
perhaps
the
liquid
comes
across
a
bit
oily
to
me
with
the
moderate
carbonation
it
makes
the
feel
richer
than
the
style
suggests
the
flavor
is
crisp
and
less
grainy
than
the
smell
a
subtle
hop
comes
through
in
swallow
short
aftertaste
o
a
crisp
smooth
well
balanced
double
pilsner
produces
a
nice
long
lasting
foamy
head
rustic
grape
smell
tastes
of
citrus
and
hops
smooth
finish
great
overall
beer
different
than
most
pilsners
that
ive
had
very
nice
i
have
little
experience
with
pilsners
is
general
and
so
i
didnt
really
know
what
to
expect
from
this
beer
i
was
a
little
worried
it
would
be
too
hoppy
due
to
the
label
saying
continuosly
hopped
however
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
beer
the
hop
taste
was
quite
mild
and
there
was
an
interesting
and
unexpected
grape
flavor
to
the
beer
this
beer
was
good
enough
that
i
would
consider
buying
it
again
i
typically
dont
go
for
pilsners
but
was
willing
to
give
this
one
a
try
due
to
it
being
an
imperial
for
me
it
started
off
good
but
something
in
the
finish
didnt
sit
well
on
my
palette
i
found
this
beer
to
be
drinkable
but
not
enjoyable
taken
from
notes
as
i
had
this
one
a
few
months
back
generally
i
enjoy
double
pilsners
and
this
one
was
no
exception
my
only
dis
on
this
is
that
it
came
across
a
touch
hot
in
a
medicinal
kind
of
way
but
that
taste
sunk
in
after
the
initial
hop
bittered
grain
taste
i
was
attracted
to
this
beer
after
reading
my
antonia
which
i
was
turned
onto
after
eating
kolaches
while
in
a
texan
town
strong
in
czech
influence
taste
seemed
off
with
the
bottle
i
had
not
a
fan
personally
of
this
one
its
a
very
clean
double
pilsner
i
enjoyed
this
beer
a
lot
crisp
bubbly
and
tasty
would
buy
again
for
sure
this
had
the
most
dominating
creamy
foam
that
stuck
around
each
pour
that
i
can
ever
recall
id
recommend
this
to
any
imperial
pilsner
fan
even
though
the
italian
version
of
this
beer
collaboration
was
somehow
superior
as
my
memory
recalls
every
other
beer
ive
reviewed
so
far
having
been
an
ale
i
felt
it
fitting
when
i
finally
got
around
to
a
dogfish
beer
that
id
choose
their
lagerific
brew
as
they
put
it
pouring
a
orangeishgold
color
it
quickly
formed
a
2
5
inch
head
made
entirely
of
large
bubbles
that
dissipated
moderately
quickly
it
left
behind
a
decent
amount
of
lacing
as
the
aroma
of
earthyspicy
hops
rose
from
the
hazy
brew
on
the
nose
is
the
drier
malts
integrated
with
the
earthy
hops
as
well
as
a
fair
amount
of
green
apple
and
traces
of
citrus
hidden
in
there
also
upon
tasting
it
a
spicy
yet
still
somewhat
mellow
bitterness
hits
your
tongue
with
the
pilsner
malt
coming
through
on
the
second
wave
it
finishes
strong
in
its
dry
malty
flavor
but
the
apples
make
a
small
cameo
popping
up
in
the
background
from
time
to
time
as
the
beer
makes
a
curtain
call
the
mouthfeel
is
actually
fantastic
as
it
serves
as
a
good
balance
to
the
style
and
serves
as
a
good
platform
to
host
the
flavors
overall
im
pleased
to
have
indulged
in
trying
this
brew
from
dogfish
as
it
is
far
from
what
was
expected
im
not
the
biggest
fan
of
lagers
so
this
was
slightly
out
of
my
comfort
zone
when
i
decided
to
try
this
beer
but
im
glad
i
proceeded
with
the
gameplan
as
it
worked
out
swimmingly
this
brew
was
composed
of
enough
oldschool
back
bone
to
be
able
to
host
and
compliment
the
newschool
funk
dogfish
head
loves
to
apply
to
their
concoctions
another
good
brew
cheers
pours
up
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
of
honey
and
fruit
with
hints
of
biscuit
the
flavor
falls
a
bit
short
probably
a
result
of
being
rather
old
there
is
a
subtle
bitterness
which
counters
the
sweet
peachy
notes
there
are
other
fruity
flavors
as
well
like
bitter
orange
and
maybe
pears
as
well
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
nice
there
is
a
nice
light
crispness
to
this
beer
overall
i
like
this
beer
it
is
crisp
and
refreshing
i
need
to
try
a
fresher
bottle
to
compare
serving
type
bottle
i
do
not
really
know
what
to
make
of
this
i
expected
a
pilsener
but
it
is
way
too
sweet
for
that
i
think
it
is
overly
hopped
but
the
hops
are
nice
it
does
not
have
the
refreshing
sharpness
of
a
lager
but
it
is
smooth
the
suspended
yeast
would
make
it
a
zwickl
still
it
is
more
an
ipa
than
a
lager
do
i
like
it
i
am
not
even
sure
about
that
this
is
easily
one
of
the
best
rounded
beers
ive
ever
had
i
wouldnt
want
one
every
day
but
it
is
excellent
and
a
real
delight
the
lime
notes
i
picked
up
on
the
nose
seem
to
disappear
in
the
taste
instead
i
pick
up
an
adequate
combination
of
grain
barley
malts
roasted
malts
sweetness
and
a
played
down
hop
finale
dry
finish
it
does
not
fail
to
satisfy
very
clear
pale
gold
in
color
with
an
off
white
head
that
starts
out
thick
and
just
never
goes
away
the
smell
is
of
sweet
light
malts
and
a
ton
of
floral
hops
really
quite
different
the
taste
is
much
like
the
smell
with
nice
sweetness
and
light
bready
malt
the
hop
character
comes
next
with
an
assertive
bitterness
not
as
much
as
an
ipa
as
it
is
still
well
within
balance
of
the
malt
the
bitterness
is
followed
by
aggressive
hop
flavor
again
all
floral
grassy
and
peppery
carbonation
is
relatively
high
and
the
finish
on
this
one
is
a
bit
sweet
a
little
slick
and
perhaps
a
touch
of
fleeting
tingly
bitterness
just
at
the
end
overall
this
is
good
but
not
as
good
as
i
had
hoped
i
understand
that
the
hops
are
meant
to
be
more
european
and
floral
but
that
leaves
them
seeming
flat
and
a
bit
one
dimensional
it
is
also
a
bit
strange
to
have
something
as
sweet
as
this
is
considering
the
style
in
the
end
interesting
but
it
may
need
a
bit
more
work
overall
this
was
my
first
imperial
pilsner
and
it
did
not
disappoint
while
it
is
fairly
light
it
does
leave
a
profoundly
refreshing
aftertaste
on
your
palate
enjoy
excellent
beer
really
clean
crisp
and
complex
delightful
o
not
a
bad
introduction
to
an
imperial
pilsner
ill
seek
it
out
to
try
it
fresh
overall
not
that
bad
cheers
this
has
been
sitting
in
my
cellar
for
over
a
year
now
and
i
think
its
time
to
pop
it
open
to
begin
with
it
almost
explodes
with
white
foam
half
the
beer
ended
up
on
the
counter
and
floor
once
i
finally
got
a
good
pour
it
was
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
huge
thick
white
head
there
had
to
have
been
some
active
yeast
bottled
with
this
otherwise
i
cant
describe
the
beers
reaction
to
stimulation
the
nose
is
funky
think
saison
funk
lots
of
malt
and
soursweet
european
yeasty
aromas
the
flavor
is
marvelous
and
nothing
what
i
expected
it
is
sour
and
funky
not
the
hoppy
palate
spoken
of
on
the
label
it
is
sweet
and
malty
on
the
front
with
a
sour
and
slightly
off
taste
following
when
i
say
off
taste
i
only
mean
it
in
the
best
of
ways
i
have
no
idea
if
this
was
dfh
original
intention
of
the
beer
or
just
a
result
of
being
bottled
in
2012
but
it
has
turned
into
a
damn
good
damn
funky
biiig
beer
o
at
first
i
was
a
a
bit
disappointed
by
the
time
i
had
worked
through
the
bottle
midway
my
mind
had
changed
it
is
a
very
tasty
beer
that
i
wouldnt
mind
having
again
overall
i
do
feel
that
my
antonia
is
just
a
lesser
form
of
the
60
minute
which
i
would
take
any
day
over
this
brew
o
this
is
a
good
beer
for
a
hot
day
the
flavors
are
mild
and
the
focus
seems
to
be
on
carbonation
and
balance
as
the
label
states
this
is
a
different
type
of
beer
for
dogfish
head
i
am
glad
i
tried
it
overall
pretty
enjoyable
beer
given
the
date
on
the
bottle
wish
i
could
have
tried
the
italian
version
it
doesnt
have
the
smoothness
of
a
pilsner
its
a
bit
raw
interesting
and
unique
its
a
strong
hoppy
pilsner
that
just
doesnt
come
together
well
for
me
theres
something
strange
coming
from
this
beer
not
sure
if
these
hop
varieties
play
well
together
i
didnt
love
it
as
much
as
id
hoped
lemon
cough
medicine
kept
coming
to
mind
smells
better
than
it
tastes
outstanding
beer
far
better
than
i
expected
would
drink
it
again

and

overall
i
am
not
real
big
on
pilsners
but
hoppy
ones
are
quite
good
great
double
pilsner
i
personally
did
not
like
this
one
something
about
the
flavors
is
wrong
for
me
it
has
some
merits
and
may
be
in
your
wheelhouse
but
it
just
does
not
fluff
my
guff
750ml
bottle
served
in
a
tumbler
beer
is
yellow
and
loaded
with
big
soda
bubbles
oh
and
its
got
a
lot
of
head
bottle
shows
a
surprising
layer
of
sediment
doesnt
smell
nearly
as
hoppy
as
i
would
have
thought
from
the
continually
hopped
imperial
pils
caption
on
the
front
of
the
label
flavor
is
mellow
only
slightly
grainy
and
while
not
all
that
crisp
on
an
absolute
scale
its
supposed
to
be
pilsner
its
quite
crisp
considering
how
heavy
it
is
overall
its
pretty
good
but
not
that
special
i
cant
get
past
that
fast
that
it
basically
tastes
like
a
golden
ale
and
bears
only
a
passing
resembles
to
the
beer
i
thought
i
was
buying
dogfish
has
apparently
brewed
quite
a
few
imperial
pilsners
over
the
years
and
im
really
wonderig
how
this
would
compare
to
golden
shower
or
era
if
you
must
be
revisionist
about
it
o
delicious
one
of
my
favorite
ipls
easy
to
drink
with
perfect
balance
between
that
classic
pilsner
malt
and
hops
92
olikable
beer
not
one
of
my
favorites
once
i
down
the
bottle
i
may
update
or
pass
out
an
awesome
american
imperial
pilsner
who
wouldnt
enjoy
this
beer
i
couldnt
say
for
sure
absolutely
recommend
this
creation
is
fine
and
certainly
has
more
character
on
account
of
the
continuous
hopping
in
a
summer
of
thirst
though
i
dont
feel
the
need
to
return
all
the
interesting
elements
suggest
it
could
be
a
pioneer
but
its
missing
an
inspired
womans
touch
to
settle
them
together
i
found
this
beer
a
collaboration
by
great
brewers
whilst
in
italy
to
be
a
world
classic
i
wish
it
was
in
steady
supply
a
new
favorite
of
mine
i
wish
it
came
in
cans
too
beautiful
with
food
beautiful
in
summer
hop
heads
and
as
well
as
all
craft
fans
must
try
this
original
pilsner
a
straightforward
hoppy
pilsner
from
dogfish
head
nice
to
see
something
more
basic
when
a
lot
of
dogfish
head
stuff
is
good
weird
o
i
like
it
considering
the
commercial
pilsner
garbage
that
is
sold
in
the
states
this
is
a
great
change
of
pace
i
dont
seem
to
have
many
craft
pilsners
sold
in
my
area
so
it
was
finally
nice
to
try
one
a
great
summery
beer
to
have
a
whole
bomber
could
go
down
very
easy
on
a
nice
day
overall
tasty
and
interesting
a
good
choice
for
introduction
to
this
beer
style
o
nothing
special
but
its
a
well
done
pilsner
o
it
may
be
unfair
for
me
to
rate
a
pils
because
i
only
drink
ipa
these
days
but
this
heavilyhopped
offering
from
dfh
is
a
great
transition
for
me
i
had
it
on
tap
cask
a
few
months
ago
and
i
loved
it
this
bottle
reaffirms
that
love
good
show
not
an
ipa
but
a
great
beverage
overall
o
this
is
my
first
pilsner
and
thus
my
first
double
pilsner
i
had
wanted
to
get
a
2013
bottle
but
instead
i
had
to
settle
for
a
cheap
2012
bottle
i
wish
they
used
my
dating
overall
thought
this
is
a
quite
nice
beer
from
dfh
i
bet
it
is
much
better
fresh
with
more
of
a
hop
profile
hopefully
but
it
holds
up
over
a
year
at
least
here
in
md
around
me
this
one
is
hard
to
find
fresh
also
this
is
one
of
the
cheaper
dfh
750s
812
i
dont
know
but
i
feel
as
if
this
one
might
benefit
from
being
a
core
beer
despite
pilsners
typically
being
my
least
favorite
style
of
beer
i
love
dogfish
head
so
much
i
decided
to
give
my
antonia
a
try
this
may
have
been
a
good
jump
into
the
pilsner
game
for
me
as
it
seems
to
be
a
bridge
between
a
true
pils
and
something
more
intense
like
an
ipa
it
pours
an
interesting
cloudy
off
yellow
with
a
huge
fluffy
white
head
that
is
glued
to
the
side
of
the
glass
smells
of
fresh
hops
lemon
and
grapefruit
hints
of
yeast
and
spice
wonderful
aroma
flavor
is
not
at
all
what
i
expected
hops
pine
lemon
touch
of
honey
and
some
bread
at
the
end
flavor
is
well
balanced
and
not
in
your
face
like
some
imperials
can
be
mouthfeel
is
very
light
and
refreshing
great
summer
beer
overall
i
really
love
this
beer
definitely
my
new
favorite
pilsner
o
quite
a
nice
lager
o
a
very
tasty
beer
a
bit
simple
but
such
is
the
style
and
this
one
is
clean
and
refreshing
with
a
solid
dose
of
hop
flavor
slightly
more
orange
in
color
than
a
typical
pale
lager
with
the
most
incredible
floral
hop
aroma
and
delicate
refined
taste
i
guess
this
one
qualifies
as
imperial
pilsner
due
to
comparatively
high
alcohol
content
certainly
a
lager
brewed
right
enthusiastically
recommended
o
not
bad
but
they
certainly
didnt
nail
it
either
i
know
that
dogfish
head
is
known
for
their
experimental
brews
but
usually
their
label
tells
you
when
they
are
getting
into
the
territory
of
eclectic
tastes
maybe
i
was
just
expecting
something
truer
to
the
style
than
this
beer
delivered
drinkin
this
on
the
most
beautiful
day
of
2013
so
far
pours
up
murky
orange
with
big
ol
white
frothy
head
aroma
of
big
pale
malts
lots
of
floral
and
some
citrus
hops
lil

up

white

lemon
peel
sweet

no

nice

i
dig
it

overall
enjoyable
beer
easy
to
drink
o
enjoyable
offering
from
dogfish
head
poured
from
an
oversize
bomber
into
a
tulip
but
also
tried
a
week
prior
at
a
dogfish
head
night
at
coasters
would
have
this
one
again
served
on
tap
at
whole
foods
schaumburg
appearance
is
a
bright
brilliant
gold
with
bone
white
head
nice
clarity
and
cascading
bubbles
good
head
retention
the
nose
is
malty
with
notes
of
toasted
bread
grass
and
some
herbaceous
qualities
that
i
cant
quite
put
my
finger
on
earthy
character
on
the
finish
taste
features
deep
malts
with
notes
of
caramel
a
hint
of
molasses
and
some
grassy
hop
character
not
getting
a
whole
lot
of
hop
bitterness
on
here
just
a
touch
of
earthy
character
mouthfeel
is
highly
carbonated
with
a
light
body
overall
pretty
unique
flavor
but
it
doesnt
all
add
up
to
a
totally
enjoyable
brew
would
pass
next
time
around
o
not
familiar
enough
with
the
style
to
comment
on
how
well
it
meets
styleexpectations
but
this
was
a
very
fresh
crisp
and
also
satisfying
drink
great
finish
feel
and
flavor
a
very
drinkable
beer
probably
great
starter
beer
for
people
who
are
leery
of
weirdcraft
beer
but
know
theres
something
better
out
there
than
bud
miller
coors
et
al
served
from
bottle
into
a
dogfish
head
snifter
proper
poured
a
golden
yelloworange
with
a
three
finger
white
head
that
subsided
to
a
half
finger
very
slowly
maintained
phenomenal
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
wheat
grain
spice
pepper
bubblegum
and
alcohol
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
bubblegum
grain
wheat
floral
spice
pepper
and
alcohol
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
high
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
average
brew
nothing
really
stood
out
on
this
one
for
with
the
exception
of
the
alcohol
if
i
am
honest
this
made
the
enjoyable
aspects
of
this
one
really
lost
in
the
booze
going
on
this
was
a
bottle
with
some
decent
age
on
it
so
i
would
have
expected
the
alcohol
to
be
completely
gone
but
alas
there
it
was
glaring
back
at
me
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
finally
and
get
it
out
of
my
cellar
but
i
doubt
i
would
do
so
again
not
bad
pours
a
slightly
hazy
medium
golden
color
with
a
huge
fluffy
white
head
that
filled
more
than
a
quarter
of
the
glass
and
stalled
my
enjoyment
of
this
brew
smells
of
citrus
and
caramel
on
top
of
bready
grainy
malt
bits
of
grapefruit
and
lemons
meld
with
the
sweet
grainy
and
bready
aromas
usually
associated
with
a
lager
the
flavor
is
sweet
with
bready
and
caramel
malts
with
some
grapefruit
and
a
lot
of
lemon
from
the
hops
theres
a
touch
of
spice
and
a
bit
of
earth
and
a
fair
amount
of
bitter
hop
bite
that
lingers
long
after
every
sip
medium
body
with
a
semi
dry
finish
a
moderate
to
high
level
of
carbonation
and
a
sweet
almost
syrupy
mouthfeel
decent
beer
probably
not
something
i
would
buy
again
but
im
glad
i
got
to
try
it
my
antonia
pours
a
darker
copper
color
with
a
nice
sized
lacing
head
there
is
a
bitter
dry
floral
aroma
much
like
an
ipa
the
taste
has
a
nice
crisp
sweet
citrus
taste
that
then
turns
floral
and
bitter
great
full
flavor
complex
i
love
the
change
on
the
palette
nice
and
dry
too
overall
a
very
interesting
beer
worth
a
try
m
medium
bodied
and
drinks
easy
with
the
carbonation
pour
is
crystal
clear
lager
yellow
with
a
tight
white
head
and
nice
lace
nose
is
doughy
and
buttery
up
front
with
a
blast
of
citrus
and
pine
behind
very
resinous
taste
is
about
the
same
with
almost
no
bitterness
almost
like
an
ipa
with
the
hop
punch
body
is
light
and
creamy
but
very
light
carbonation
with
a
burn
of
alochol
in
the
finish
overall
definitely
one
of
my
alltime
favorites
here
the
idea
of
mixing
a
czech
pilsener
with
west
coast
hops
is
brilliant
and
really
pays
off
in
this
beer
i
cant
recommend
this
one
enough
good
substantial
and
complex
not
sure
if
i
should
sip
or
consume
with
food
or
drain
the
cup
odd
i
liked
it
but
it
is
a
tough
one
to
get
super
excited
to
drink
again
i
liked
it
but
this
is
a
special
occasion
brew
o
i
absolutely
love
this
brew
its
such
a
great
balance
of
sweetness
hops
citrus
grapefruits
a
hardly
a
hint
of
the
7
5
abv
could
drink
this
all
day
have
had
it
before
this
review
and
will
continue
to
look
for
it
again
in
the
future
great
job
dfh
on
this
brew
medium
bodied
with
mediumlow
carbonation
a
real
nice
natural
softness
from
the
bottle
conditioning
great
feel
o
nice
herbal
quality
to
it
smooth
and
drinkable
i
like
this
smells
great
looks
a
bit
hazy
for
a
pils
mouthfeel
is
average
for
a
pils
taste
is
a
bit
disappointing
as
it
has
a
strange
bitterness
to
it
that
i
have
not
experienced
in
a
pils
or
an
imperial
pils
about
2
fingers
of
head
and
i
drank
this
out
of
a
pilsner
glass
almost
a
weird
chemical
aftertaste
not
great
not
terrible
very
middle
of
the
roadi
was
hoping
for
so
much
more
cheers
enjoyed
at
the
fairfax
brewpub
this
imperial
pilsner
is
a
very
clear
pale
amber
color
with
a
decent
white
head
and
plenty
of
lacing
the
nose
hit
includes
deep
maple
malt
and
nutty
red
grapes
with
some
wheat
wine
ideas
very
nice
and
thankfully
the
taste
follows
suit
wow
again
somewhat
like
a
wheat
wine
brew
in
my
book
pleasant
fruit
sweetness
blended
expertly
with
nutty
grain
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
a
pretty
viscous
feel
slightly
cloying
but
not
a
problem
delicate
carbonation
and
smooth
going
down
for
an
imperial
delicious
light
gold
in
color
and
definitely
hazy
towards
the
end
of
the
bottle
head
is
overbearing
and
often
overflows
the
glass
even
after
just
a
moderate
pour
it
does
linger
nicely
once
relaxing
the
mouthfeel
is
great
with
a
finer
and
frothy
carbonation
smells
of
a
pilsner
beer
mixed
with
honey
taste
has
a
lot
of
sweetness
again
honey
but
the
pilsner
is
hard
to
detect
its
still
a
good
beer
but
have
trouble
putting
it
in
a
pilsner
category
this
beer
is
one
that
seems
to
have
some
highs
and
lows
but
overall
is
pretty
solid
i
just
wouldnt
buy
it
again
at
that
price
around
12
o
an
excellent
beer
that
respects
tradition
but
is
somewhat
unique
at
the
same
time
the
combination
of
hops
really
works
here
i
dont
normally
spring
for
10
bombers
but
anyone
who
like
a
good
pils
should
give
this
a
try
highly
recommended
o
different
lots
going
on
in
this
one
like
a
complicated
film
you
have
to
watch
a
couple
of
times
to
pick
it
all
up
immediately
i
can
tell
that
this
is
going
to
be
a
different
beer
than
the
borgo
version
the
nose
is
kind
of
an
unusual
citrus
thing
the
flavor
profile
is
vastly
different
as
well
there
is
much
more
tang
and
citrus
on
this
and
i
just
want
to
say
that
the
word
clogged
comes
to
mind
perhaps
congested
would
be
more
appropriate
as
there
seems
to
be
too
much
going
on
and
piled
together
leaving
little
room
for
the
beer
to
speak
subtly
at
all
and
yes
i
realize
this
is
dfh
and
subtle
would
never
be
a
word
associated
with
the
brewery
but
i
am
comparing
this
version
against
the
borgo
version
overall
judged
to
style
ill
say
that
this
is
okay
a
bit
too
vibrant
for
me
the
refined
nature
of
the
borgo
interpretation
speaks
to
me
in
volumes
while
this
one
seems
more
like
a
three
line
blurb
on
the
10th
page
of
yesterdays
newspaper
reviewed
from
notes
overall
while
i
like
a
bit
of
crispness
in
a
pilsner
that
aspect
is
hard
to
find
in
an
imperial
pilsner
and
this
beer
is
no
different
otherwise
it
is
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
o
this
is
a
good
beer
for
a
hot
day
the
flavors
are
mild
and
the
focus
seems
to
be
on
carbonation
and
balance
as
the
label
states
this
is
a
different
type
of
beer
for
dogfish
head
i
am
glad
i
tried
it
it
is
a
good
beer
to
serve
chilled
at
a
summer
picnic
o
this
beer
is
pretty
easy
to
drink
and
the
higher
abv
is
very
well
hidden
not
quite
as
good
as
the
version
from
birra
del
borgo
but
it
is
enjoyable
and
a
much
better
value
considering
it
costs
less
and
is
a
much
larger
bottle
this
was
good
i
just
think
i
dont
prefer
the
imperial
pilsener
for
an
imperial
lager
o
quite
good
the
only
thing
i
dislike
is
the
tartness
which
interrupts
the
otherwise
ideal
characteristics
of
this
beer
otherwise
the
flavor
profile
is
ideal
its
drinkable
and
enjoyable
overall
pours
a
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
fair
amount
of
head
hops
are
a
little
more
present
on
the
nose
but
the
malty
profile
comes
through
on
the
tongue
its
definitely
stronger
than
a
regular
ol
pilsener
but
its
not
outofthisworld
it
doesnt
have
to
be
because
thats
not
why
we
drink
pilseners
this
beer
is
still
refreshing
while
also
providing
a
little
extra
warmth
o
almost
like
a
pilsnerpale
aleipa
hybrid
not
your
typical
pilsner
but
very
tasty
and
enjoyable
o
i
wish
i
could
find
more
pilsners
like
this
one
im
sure
there
are
many
germanczech
examples
but
few
fresh
ones
this
packs
refreshment
and
complexity
in
one
bottle
and
is
one
of
my
very
favorite
dfh
beers
this
was
an
excellent
example
of
an
american
imperial
pilsner
i
am
not
much
of
a
pilsner
lover
generally
prefer
heavier
beers
but
this
was
a
delight
my
buddy
and
i
really
enjoyed
this
as
a
nice
switch
to
the
conventional
american
pilsner
genre
a
heavy
yet
pleasing
pilsner
ontap
at
star
bar
in
denver
i
love
that
place
this
was
a
nice
find
hazed
straw
gold
with
a
thick
puff
of
white
foam
solid
blast
of
herbal
and
citric
hops
black
pepper
lemon
pith
mint
grass
sweeter
than
expected
with
some
sugar
cookie
and
raw
dough
a
tad
yeasty
definitely
one
of
the
better
takes
on
this
style
but
the
sweetness
is
too
much
for
more
than
about
12oz
and
some
dryness
would
really
help
bring
out
the
pilsner
qualities
of
the
beer
overall
although
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
i
enjoy
ipas
and
other
hop
forward
styles
so
this
beer
is
a
no
brainer
for
me
overall
this
is
extremely
drinkable
and
quite
refreshing
perfect
for
a
warm
saturday
evening
didnt
have
any
problems
finishing
the
pint
a
rapid
pace
even
though
i
wanted
to
enjoy
it
couldnt
help
myself
this
is
a
very
good
beer
i
paired
it
with
italian
which
is
a
very
good
call
there
is
no
real
complexity
however
which
holds
it
back
a
little
bit
from
being
absolutely
ideal
but
still
its
a
strongly
crafted
brew
with
obvious
quality
and
i
would
certainly
recommend
it
to
any
one
who
is
a
fan
of
hops
or
bold
lager
brews
originally
reviewed
02092011
d
very
drinkable
really
nice
hoppy
imperial
pilsner
the
balance
is
really
nice
between
the
hops
and
malt
and
the
finish
is
really
nice
and
clean
definately
a
good
beer
how
good
im
not
sure
o
very
nice
beer
interesting
as
a
pilsner
this
has
a
very
unique
taste
o
good
pilsner
dont
usually
appreciate
a
pils
but
has
good
amount
of
hops
puts
in
another
league
with
complexity
overall
this
is
quite
tame
for
dogfish
head
but
i
like
it
a
lot
its
clean
crisp
and
flavourful
in
a
reserved
kind
of
manner
ive
tried
some
different
examples
of
pilsners
in
my
time
and
i
must
say
though
dogfish
head
is
able
to
make
your
mouth
feel
like
it
just
got
punched
with
flavor
this
time
around
i
dug
the
hit
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
the
hops
are
bitter
and
yet
sweetness
is
slightbut
the
bitter
isnt
bad
you
can
taste
that
they
used
some
quality
hops
in
this
brew
i
wouldnt
reccomend
to
someone
whos
used
to
lighter
pilsners
due
to
the
fact
this
flavor
is
so
intense
it
might
turn
off
a
possible
convert
but
if
youre
looking
for
a
pilsner
thats
gonna
give
you
some
bang
for
you
buck
this
isnt
bad
o
def
an
enjoyable
dfh
beer
nice
fruit
flavors
mixing
with
the
floral
hops
flavor
and
ending
with
a
crips
bitterness
overall
another
great
beer
a
crisp
clear
golden
yellow
pour
with
a
perfect
looking
2
fingers
fluffy
white
head
smells
hoppier
than
any
pilsner
ive
ever
had
and
am
looking
forward
to
tasting
it
aromas
of
grass
bread
honey
orange
bitter
sweet
hoppy
taste
up
front
with
slightly
sweet
malty
backbone
the
hops
come
back
for
the
aftertaste
and
make
their
presence
in
this
wonderful
display
of
a
pilsner
a
nice
light
bodied
beer
with
a
crisp
finish
i
give
this
a
high
overall
score
because
it
makes
me
actually
enjoy
a
pilsner
usually
they
are
lacking
flavor
and
aroma
but
not
this
one
if
it
werent
for
the
fact
that
i
havent
enjoyed
any
of
the
birra
del
borgo
beers
id
want
to
actually
give
their
version
of
this
a
shot
pours
a
clearish
yellow
body
with
mucho
head
that
stays
around
forever
and
is
very
clingysticky
a
strong
pils
malt
aroma
with
some
sweetness
as
well
as
a
grainy
grassy
hop
aroma
good
clean
pils
taste
the
igher
than
usual
abv
doesnt
deter
from
an
easy
drinking
beer
that
is
hoppy
and
grainy
and
has
a
good
sweet
edge
to
it
simplitsic
but
very
enjoyable
beer
this
is
easy
to
drink
on
a
warm
spring
day
o
a
really
amazing
interesting
beer
that
takes
a
totally
fresh
approach
to
the
pilsener
adding
tons
of
hops
that
give
it
a
rich
layered
flavor
thats
unlike
anything
else
its
very
original
and
delicious
an
intense
yet
enjoyable
beer
for
the
style
bold
and
delightful
nicely
balanced
between
grains
and
hops
for
such
a
big
beer
ill
hate
to
see
this
bottle
gone
so
i
may
pick
up
a
few
more
bottles
in
the
near
future
gotta
have
more
o
im
not
a
huge
pils
drinker
but
this
is
a
nicely
made
brew
very
drinkable
and
a
good
well
rounded
beer

notes
poured
into
a
nostradamus
flute
glass
pours
a
light
orange
amber
moderate
white

that
lasted
a
little
while
nice
lacing
aroma
of
citrus
light
fruit
and
hops
faint

notes
citrus

and
light
malt
with
a
dry
middle
and

bitter
finish
a

in

in
the
end
otherwise
a
nicely
balanced
good
tasting
imperial
pilsner
on
a
bit
of
a
pilsner
kick
this
spring
decided
to
revisit
my
antonia
pours
a
lovely
light
clear
gold
with
a
fluffy
head
i
really
cant
put
the
aroma
into
words
other
than
to
say
that
it
smells
like
its
going
to
taste
crisp
and
delicious
and
it
does
theres
a
slightly
bitter
strong
alcohol
bite
that
follows
the
crisp
pilsner
taste
a
little
bit
of
tangy
citrus
there
as
well
this
is
the
only
imperial
pilsner
ive
had
so
i
have
nothing
to
compare
it
to
even
so
its
a
great
beer
for
sure
o
this
is
a
nice
unique
take
on
the
style
and
i
would
have
this
again
overall
good
enough
that
i
am
buying
another
bottle
and
taking
it
over
to
my
friends
place
tonight
a
really
good
beer
that
ive
been
in
love
with
lately
not
the
best
ive
had
of
this
style
but
i
do
like
a
bomber
of
here
and
there
incredibly
clean
for
such
a
big
beer
medium
mouthfeel
and
very
drinkable
great
take
on
a
pilsner
another
great
experiment
from
dfh
o
more
hoppy
than
i
figured
itd
be
a
little
more
carbonation
than
i
like
as
well
good
flavors
though
and
worth
picking
up
o
very
refreshing
hoppy
pilsner
overall
a
pilsner
at
the
top
of
the
food
chain
tasty
fullfilling
and
cant
honestly
complain
about
anything
else
salud
very
drinkable
a
bit
sessionable
and
very
very
enjoyable
o
good
beer
but
poor
drink
ability
for
a
pilsner
not
sure
i
like
the
mixture
going
on
here
overall
this
is
one
nice
beer
it
is
crisp
and
refreshing
yet
packed
with
quite
a
bit
of
flavor
one
i
will
surly
do
again
wow
one
fantastic
beer
have
had
the
italian
brewed
version
and
the
american
version
i
am
not
sure
if
i
actually
enjoyed
the
italian
version
better
or
just
the
idea
of
it
but
the
carbonation
is
definitively
better
in
the
italian
version
many
very
tiny
densely
packed
and
very
effervescent
bubbles
any
how
this
beer
is
fairly
lite
in
flavor
and
really
has
no
bold
side
and
i
would
say
the
only
thing
that
really
leaps
out
at
your
palate
at
any
given
point
in
a
sip
is
a
sweet
brief
citrusy
moment
that
is
soon
followed
by
a
quick
finish
golden
effervescence
mammoth
billowing
white
head
great
clarity
with
only
a
bit
of
yeast
this
is
a
beautiful
beer
the
smell
is
fresh
herbal
and
spicy
hops
along
with
a
soft
pale
malt
scent
the
taste
is
soft
sweet
and
refreshing
its
sweeter
and
stronger
than
most
pils
but
is
still
clean
full
in
body
but
the
finish
is
crisp
and
abrupt
nice
mixture
of
hops
and
malt
its
an
aggressive
beer
that
still
projects
a
subtle
and
delicate
balance
great
overall
this
was
good
not
my
favorite
style
but
would
definitely
recommend
to
my
friends
who
do
like
style
and
i
would
have
it
again
overall
this
is
a
very
creative
unique
beer
overall
this
is
pretty
good
i
think
i
prefer
it
to
many
standard
ipas
id
definitely
have
it
again
this
seems
like
sort
of
an
odd
style
as
pilsners
are
quite
light
and
delicate
and
imperial
anything
tends
to
be
less
than
light
and
delicate
i
wasnt
really
sure
what
to
expect
but
this
beer
really
impressed
me
if
it
wasnt
so
damn
expensive
i
would
buy
this
all
the
time
especially
for
the
warmer
months
note
if
you
pour
the
yeast
it
changes
the
beer
for
the
worse
sort
of
mellows
it
out
and
makes
it
boring
comes
in
a
champange
huge
bottle
its
like
a
bomber
a
few
more
ounces
o
a
damn
good
pilsner
alcohol
is
well
hidden
and
very
citrus
and
piny
very
hoppy
for
a
pilsner
but
well
balanced
and
a
very
smooth
finish
overall
while
this
is
an
ok
brew
it
does
leave
me
disappointed
i
think
because
i
was
expecting
more
and
was
super
excited
to
try
it
worth
a
try
but
glad
i
didnt
buy
the
bottle
o
this
has
the
makings
of
a
good
beer
and
i
really
dont
think
the
hops
should
have
fallen
off
as
quick
as
they
have
but
what
can
you
do
id
try
it
on
draught
if
i
saw
it
but
i
dont
think
id
buy
it
in
bottles
anymore
o
this
is
a
fine
imperial
pils
that
has
dogfish
heads
unmistakable
signature
all
over
it
im
surprised
it
has
taken
this
long
for
them
to
produce
a
lager
because
judging
from
the
quality
of
this
beer
they
obviously
have
the
ability
to
do
lagers
well
even
if
youre
leery
of
bottomfermented
beverages
give
this
one
a
go
pours
a
translucent
honey
color
into
my
pint
glass
a
tall
billowy
head
develops
on
top
aroma
is
fantastic
with
pronounced
floral
and
fruity
aspects
lemon
pineapple
grapefruit
apricot
as
well
as
sugary
caramel
all
in
there
tastes
great
much
like
the
aroma
and
has
a
deep
malt
backbone
as
well
with
a
pleasant
smack
of
hoppy
bitterness
coats
the
mouth
nicely
with
a
warming
sensation
going
down
lots
of
lacing
on
the
glass
overall
i
have
only
had
a
few
imperial
pilsners
but
this
one
stacks
up
quite
well
and
also
is
the
archetype
of
the
ba
description
for
the
style
well
done
dfh
o
this
is
a
very
good
brew
though
i
would
agree
with
another
post
that
this
resembles
an
apa
maybe
more
than
a
pilsner
even
still
this
was
a
very
nice
balanced
beer
this
still
resembles
a
pilsner
enough
to
satisfy
pilsner
fans
but
has
enough
hop
complexity
to
cross
over
for
the
paipa
fans
overall
this
is
a
much
better
beer
than
i
remembered
maybe
the
first
time
was
too
fresh
and
too
hoppy
weve
had
this
for
a
few
months
so
the
hops
probably
faded
back
a
fair
amount
now
that
the
90
minute
ipa
is
hard
to
find
in
new
england
i
think
this
is
going
to
be
my
recommended
substitute
overall
as
i
mentioned
im
not
a
big
pilsner
fan
as
a
rule
but
this
beer
grew
on
me
a
bit
as
the
bottle
emptied
its
definitely
enjoyable
though
i
probably
wouldnt
pick
it
up
again
i
do
have
to
dock
it
points
though
because
it
really
comes
off
to
me
as
a
crisp
apa
rather
than
a
pilsner
i
appreciate
what
the
brewers
were
trying
to
do
but
its
got
just
a
bit
too
much
going
on
and
the
elements
dont
all
mesh
well
for
me
not
as
clean
as
i
was
hoping
for
if
that
makes
sense
taste
is
exactly
like
the
smell
it
feels
so
slippery
and
soapy
and
also
tastes
slightly
soapy
citric
hops
give
it
a
bit
of
balance
actually
has
a
light
body
and
feels
light
for
its
style
malt
is
almost
nonexistent
which
is
odd
for
the
style
but
i
dont
mind
it
is
very
balanced
and
rather
drinkable
glad
i
got
to
try
it
on
tap
instead
of
buying
a
750
and
drinking
it
all
myself
overall
a
nice
crisp
hoppy
pilsner
i
am
always
thankful
when
a
brewer
brews
beer
like
this
o
an
absolutely
fantastic
beer
this
is
perhaps
my
favorite
beer
by
dfh
which
is
saying
a
lot
highly
recommend
this
beer
o
leave
it
to
dogfish
to
buck
the
trend
of
traditional
pilsners
this
is
not
your
traditional
nobly
hopped
crisp
and
clean
pilsner
offering
it
is
a
flavorful
strong
original
take
on
the
style
while
not
strict
to
the
style
it
is
certainly
an
interesting
adaptation
would
recommend
overall
nice
beer
not
so
much
of
a
pilsner
for
me
but
i
like
it
750ml
bottle
this
one
pours
a
slightly
hazy
straw
yellow
color
there
was
a
huge
frothy
white
head
on
it
that
leaves
some
lacing
pretty
good
hop
nose
to
this
one
earthy
and
floral
notes
some
spiciness
also
a
fair
amount
of
maltiness
in
the
background
the
taste
is
just
a
bit
bitter
with
a
hint
of
spiciness
fair
amount
of
maltiness
in
the
background
all
in
all
a
pretty
nice
pilsner
i
really
hope
other
brewers
use
the
traditional
pils
as
their
benchmark
for
imperial
pilsners
and
not
my
antonia
finally
a
pilsner
than
i
can
get
off
on
this
is
a
hop
masterpiece
with
all
kinds
of
aromatic
and
bittering
hops
going
on
pours
a
chewy
straw
gold
color
with
a
nice
white
head
smells
strong
and
very
hoppy
taste
is
complex
for
a
pilsner
with
layers
of
interesting
hops
and
pale
malts
juxtaposing
one
another
in
rhythm
this
is
a
really
groovy
pils
and
a
strong
one
really
full
bodied
for
a
pilsner
as
well
and
has
that
hop
thickness
like
the
120
minute
just
to
a
much
lesser
degree
nice
job
yet
again
here
by
dfh
pours
with
a
three
finger

head
that
fades
very
slowly
leaving
a
good
lace

amber
color
medium
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
floral
hop
nose
and
flavor
is
good
balance
of

and
hops

again

in

this

to
drink
i
am
not
the
biggest
pilsner
fan
i
like
them
fine
but
it
isnt
a
style
i
usually
seek
out
that
said
ill
try
anything
with
the
dogfish
name
on
it
this
beer
is
a
must
for
pilsner
fans
or
dfh
fans

this
offering
has
a
very
strong
hop
presence
for
a
pils
i
am
not
complaining
the
finish
is
nice
and
dry
i
am
a
fan
of
dfh
and
this
offering
upholds
my
faith
in
them
example
of
a
failure
when
imperializing
a
style
that
aybe
shouldnt
be
od
a
drinkable
dpils
alcohol
is
very
management
flavors
are
not
over
the

not
abusive

the

at
times

great
mingling

greatly
enjoyable
and
i
will
enjoy
this
again
o
not
a

fan
of

this
was
a
good
pilsner
i
enjoyed
would
recommend
enjoyable
with
good

4
drinkability
one
of
the
more
drinkable
imperial
types
tasty
heres
to
a
few
wins
next
weekend
the
carbonation
isnt
strong
the
body
is
medium
and
the
brew
is
a
bit
dry
this
imperial
pilsner
pours
a
rich
golden
orange
color
with
a
fingers
width
of
white

smells
of

taste
is
sort
of
bready
a
bit
of
a
heavy
lager
taste
sweet
and
citrusy
hop
bite
lingering
with
a
slight
bit
of
alcohol
coming
through
ive
heard
many
mixed
reviews
but
i
have
to
say
i
like
this
one
thumbs
up
some
very
nice
flavoring
and
the
obvious
use
of
quality
ingredients
that
dfh
is
know
for
is
there
but
this
may
be
extreme
to
the
point
that
it
maybe
shouldnt
be
labeled
as
a
pilsner
obviously
this
isnt
my
favorite
from
my
favorite
brewery
but
i
would
give
anything
they
do
a
try
if
you
like
dfh
then
try
this
one
d
although
its
undeniable
this
beer
was
made
with
quality
ingredients
and
craftsmanship
what
i
poured
out
of
this
bottle
was
a
disappointing
imbalance
resulting
in
a
ridiculously
over
hopped
beer
being
subsequently
over
malted
or
maybe
underlagered
i
dont
know
but
i
think
the
yeast
needs
to
eat
some
more
of
the
sugar
and
bump
up
the
abv
or
just
make
it
one
hell
of
a
fragrant
regular
pils
but
then
again
that
wouldnt
be
offcentered
now
would
it
i
give
a
schlitz
for
this
high
gravity
pils
it
is
tasty
and
interesting
but
quite
expensive
94
i
would
definitely
drink
this
again
imperial
pilsner
is
an
intriguing
style
that
had
me
at
hello
dogfish
heads
representative
works
because
it
was
created
under
the
aegis
of
one
who
knows
the
craftiness
and
complexity
of
certain
beers
anyone
can
put
imperial
pilsner
on
a
label
and
make
it
work
dogfish
head
did
and
does
o
a
great
interpretation
of
the
style
definitely
worth
picking
up
i
enjoyed
this
imperial
pilsner
out
of
a
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
this
pilsner
poured
a
hazy
golden
color
it
produced
a
medium
sized
white
head
retention
was
very
good
the
lacing
was
above
average
the
aroma
was
very
nice
for
a
pilsner
full
of
malt
and
grassy
hop
and
citrus
the
taste
of
this
brew
was
semi
sweet
full
of
malted
grain
and
had
a
nice
bitter
hoppy
citrus
flavor
full
body
dry
finish
this
was
my
first
shot
at
an
imperial
pilsner
i
will
say
that
this
is
the
best
pilsner
that
i
have
ever
sampled
another
awesome
brew
from
dogfish
o
inreally
enjoy
this
brew
love
the
hop
character
smooth
but
very
complex
not
what
i
had
expected
out
of
a
pilsner
but
notnat
all
disappointed
pours
a
slightly
hazy
but
clear
straw
gold
with
tons
and
tons
of
tiny
bubbles
rising
to
form
a
massive
three
finger
pillowy
head
smells
like
fresh
cut
grass
and
lemon
i
also
get
a
nice
maltiness
coming
through
nothing
stellar
about
the
aroma
but
nice
nonetheless
the
taste
starts
off
malty
sweet
but
then
turns
into
a
nice
bitterness
it
finishes
slightly
dry
but
nothing
like
an
ipa
lemon
and
grass
are
the
most
dominant
flavors
remarkably
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
this
is
a
beer
i
wish
dfh
would
sell
in
6
packs
overall
fantastic
brew
this
is
not
complex
this
is
not
unique
and
this
is
not
the
best
beer
i
have
ever
had
but
this
is
surely
the
most
refreshing
and
best
tasting
pilsner
i
have
tried
to
date
if
you
are
a
hop
head
looking
for
something
new
try
this
one
out
a
for
style
dr
this
is
an
outright
perversion
of
the
style
the
price
is
high
this
was
in
rome
and
the
quality
is
rather
limited
ill
try
it
in
bottle
form
back
in
the
states
but
its
far
from
high
on
me
list
od
very
drinkable
a
lovely
blend
of
strenth
and
lighter
hops
to
make
the
style
seem
very
workable
quite
nice
tulunes
in
jtown
pa
set
me
up
again
with
a
great
fing
beer
the
my
antonia
from
doggie
fish
head
was
awesome
the
color
was
a
hazy
yellow
with
thick
white
foamy
head
that
laced
like
a
hot
victoria
secret
model
the
smell
had
nice
hopcirtus
tones
with
balanced
pilsner
malt
the
taste
flowwed
the
smell
lead
and
was
quite
good
the
hopcitrus
notes
were
balanced
nicely
with
pilsner
malt
the
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
tough
because
of
the
abv
but
otherwise
a
very
drinkable
beer
overall
very
good
bottle
poured
a
lightly
hazy
orangey
color
pilsner
with
a
large
foamy
head
with
good
retention
aroma
of
sweet
malt
with
loads
of
floral
hoppy
notes
is
quite
enjoyable
taste
is
a
nice
mix
between
some
sweet
floral
malts
which
are
well
balanced
by
some
dry
crisp
hops
body
is
quite
full
with
good
carbonation
and
no
apparent
alcohol
very
well
brewed
and
even
though
quite
extreme
still
manage
to
retain
some
balance
and
drinkability
bomber
of
great
smooth
fun
the
pilsner
hops
and
european
malts
comes
through
the
scent
which
is
floal
thick
white
head
on
light
yellow
pilsner
body
very
smooth
and
good
drinkability
carbonation
is
right
there
burning
in
system
so
a
bit
acidic
with
its
lemony
taste
drying
finish
o
i
found
this
one
to
be
rather
boring
but
still
pretty
easy
to
drink
just
not
really
me
thing
i
guess
the
appearance
is
a
bright
straw
color
with
a
generous
white
head
it
has
an
exceptional
nose
very
inviting
there
is
hay
citrus
fruit
corn
and
sugar
moving
on
to
the
taste
this
imperial
comes
across
with
banana
malts
hops
and
more
of
that
sugary
sweetness
but
i
found
all
of
it
to
be
very
well
balanced
it
has
a
medium
body
to
it
with
perfect
level
of
carbonation
has
a
nice
fresh
hoppy
flavor
not
too
heavy
but
not
too
light
held
up
with
some
sweet
nondescript
fruity
flavors
the
finish
was
a
pleasant
hops
bitterness
pretty
solid
beer
from
dfh
nothing
too
extreme
or
complex
serves
as
a
reminder
that
lagers
can
be
made
this
good
and
be
quite
enjoyable
rather
smooth
and
cream
on
the
palate
o
meh
not
worth
the
price
atall
d
i
received
a
bottle
of
this
for
my
birthday
and
what
a
gift
it
was
glad
i
got
the
opportunity
to
try
it
if
you
see
one
around
dont
hesitate
overall
i
thought
this
was
an
excellent
rendition
of
the
imperial
pilsner
style
ive
had
better
versions
but
this
had
a
unique
hop
character
and
was
probably
one
of
the
best
looking
that
i
have
tried
so
far
i
guess
things
are
bound
to
get
crazy
when
you
try
to
make
an
imperial
pilsner
and
especially
when
sam
is
at
the
helm
this
is
a
kick
ass
beer
though
it
just
doesnt
remind
me
of
a
lager
o
a
solid
interpretation
on
the
style
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
pilsners
in
general
but
this
was
a
tasty
beer
this
makes
me
want
to
try
other
pilsners
but
not
more
than
one
here
and
there
overall
a
complex
beer
which
may
be
one
of
the
better
imperial
pilsners
i
have
had
even
if
you
dont
like
pilsners
this
one
would
be
worth
trying
this
is
a
very
good
and
interesting
beer
im
glad
i
stumbled
upon
it
and
hope
to
have
it
again
it
is
very
balanced
nuanced
and
fairly
complex
definitely
worth
a
try
do
one
of
the
better
impy
pils
ive
had
nice
summer
evening
beers
to
split
with
a
great
friend
thanks
fdkayti
overall
bouncing
it
off
my
recollections
of
dfh
golder
shower
this
one
seems
to
have
a
more
rustic
grainy
quality
certainly
more
bitterness
and
less
sweetness
alcohol
and
body
this
is
a
solid
beer
everything
about
it
is
enjoyable
the
only
down
side
is
that
pilsners
imperial
or
not
are
boring
to
me
the
750
ml
bottle
is
about
all
id
want
of
this
o
really
impressed
w
this
beer
definitely
the
best
of
the
style
ive
personally
had
recommended
and
a
nice
summer
beer
w
a
malt
backbone
m
the
mouthfeel
is
sweet
and
thick
decent
but
i
think
that
i
need
a
fresher
bottle
a
taste
forward
drinking
pilsner
lacks
the
spicy
dry
attribute
that
makes
most
pilsners
d
overall
an
interesting
style
that
ill
have
to
try
more
of
to
get
more
familiar
with
with
regards
to
this
offering
i
enjoyed
the
taste
quite
a
bit
with
the
mouthfeel
leaving
a
little
to
be
desired
for
me
nonetheless
i
could
easily
go
through
a
bomber
of
this
delicious
o
another
great
brew
from
dfh
very
close
to
an
ipa
with
the
malt
flavors
being
the
only
separator
i
would
and
have
bought
this
more
than
once
and
will
continue
to
do
so
when
its
available
just
a
really
great
job
by
dfh
i
really
love
this
beer
and
will
seek
it
out
and
other
imperial
pils
down
the
road
glassware
750ml

mindblowing
here
but
a
solid
beer
and
enjoyable
drink
wellsuited
for
the
summer
poured
ontap

served
in

throughout
the
body
of
the
brew
the
nose
is
clean
with
toasted
oats
and
a
smooth
hops
presence
the
flavor
is
a
smokeytoasted
cereal
characteristic
initially
with
a
mild
lacing
of
peppered
hops
the
beer
has
a
creamy
feel
and
it
leaves
a
considerable
lacing
along
the
flass
while
you
drink
the
aftertaste
is
all
hops
with
a
smooth
and
slightly
bitter
finish
very
tasty
o
one
of
these
big
bottles
will
set
your
mind
right
goes
down
fast
at
7
5
packs
a
more
than
average
pilsner
punch
one
of
the
best
smelling
pilsners
i
have
had
but
it
strangely
seems
more
like
an
ipa
recommended
although
i
am
not
a
big
pilsner
guy
this
is
definitely
worth
a
shot
personally
and
i
realize
this
is
an
imperial
if
this
were
the
standard
pilsner
then
id
be
a
big
fan
of
the
style
another
great
tasty
brew
from
dfh
probably
wouldnt
have
even
picked
this
up
had
they
not
been
out
of
just
about
everything
else
down
at
the
rehoboth
brewpub
im
definitely
glad
i
did
though
will
definitely
be
revisiting
this
o
i
drank
nearly
a
whole
750ml
of
this
on
my
own
happily
definitely
some
of
dfhs
best
work
od
a
great
beer
that
is
only
showing
its
alcohol
content
as
the
bottle
empties
can
and
will
finish
this
on
my
own
greedy
kayti
is
greedy
really
enjoyed
this
imperial
pils
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
silky
smooth
with
low
carbonation
a
medium
body
and
very
high
drinkability
that
covers
the
abv
completely
another
great
beer
from
dfh
that
i
recommend
trying
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
o
i
enjoyed
this
brew
an
interesting
member
of
dfhs
lineup
considering
its
a
lager
i
would
enjoy
another
but
it
is
pricey
overall
its
dfh
so
that
should
say
damn
good
all
on
its
own
without
much
further
comment
this
beer
lends
credence
to
my
growing
belief
that
if
you
crank
up
the
abv
and
toss
in
loads
of
hops
you
can
pretty
much
pave
right
over
any
ability
to
distinguish
between
an
ale
and
a
pilsner
here
we
have
a
tasty
beer
bright
carbonation
assertive
but
not
overpowering
hops
with
some
citrus
notes
body
is
a
bit
on
the
lighter
side
as
befits
a
pilsner
but
then
again
it
could
pass
for
a
lightbodied
ale
alchohol
lends
a
bit
of
pepper
at
the
finish
with
just
a
little
rawness
got
to
try
this
one
at
the
2010
acbf
the
beer
poured
out
as
a
nice
golden
color
with
a
strong
looking
white
head
on
top
the
smell
of
citrus
and
grains
come
through
on
the
nose
very
pleasant
aroma
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
nothing
like
a
typical
pilsner
i
was
hoping
itd
be
something
a
little
over
the
top
and
it
was
thankfully
it
had
mostly
citrus
fruit
notes
lots
of
hops
also
the
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
is
smooth
and
very
drinkable
might
be
a
bit
of
a
dangerous
beer
to
drink
a
lot
of
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
id
like
to
have
it
again
one
day
o
overall
this
is
a
solid
imperial
pils
one
that
sets
the
baseline
for
the
style
maybe
a
bit
over
hopped
but
still
a
very
good
beer
while
it
might
be
imperial
i
expected
a
lot
more
from
dfh
o
this
limited
release
from
dogfish
head
was
a
pleasant
surprise
a
nice
combination
of
a
classic
german
pils
and
a
westcoast
aipa
i
would
drink
this
again
overall
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
imperial
ales
but
i
would
have
like
the
flavor
to
have
been
a
little
bit
less
sweet
and
cleaner
not
my
favorite
style
and
imo
overpriced
but
a
good
beer
all
the
same
o
this
is
a
really
well
put
together
imperial
pils
has
the
main
characteristics
of
a
pilsner
but
a
nice
amount
of
hops
that
give
it
a
really
nice
kick
a
great
ip
not
too
big
and
a
nice
change
of
pace
for
dfh
how
often
do
you
see
this
style
not
cheap
but
a
nice
treat
a
good
beer
for
sure
but
not
necessarily
up
my
alley
i
suppose
citrus
up
front
sweet
orange
followed
by
bitter
grapefruit
which
dominates
the
citrus
notes
finishes
dry
with
a
creamy
smoothness
butterscotch
coating
a
damn
good
beer
the
best
pilsner
ive
had
great
beer
i
have
something
of
a
lovehate
relationship
with
dogfish
head
i
love
their
experimentation
and
their
boundary
pushing
but
i
often
find
their
beers
a
little
misguided
and
sometimes
undrinkable
this
is
not
one
of
thosethis
is
a
big
beer
no
doubt
but
one
which
has
been
put
together
with
style
and
balance
in
mind
great
work
o
this
is
one
of
several
lagers
ive
been
enjoying
since
the
weather
got
warm
anything
like
this
summer
teeth
joes
pils
etc
that
can
give
you
tons
of
flavor
and
be
this
sessionable
are
great
for
this
time
of
year
my
favorite
dfh
hopforward
beer
to
date
would
gladly
drink
more
of
these
o
overall
i
enjoyed
the
slight
bitter
hop
bite
that
was
well
balanced
and
mellowed
with
a
decent
malt
backing
this
was
a
very
drinkable
pilsner
that
i
woulnt
mind
having
another
one
of
overall
i
cant
say
this
is
my
favorite
dfh
brew
but
for
a
pilsner
i
guess
this
is
pretty
good
na
zdravje
o
i
wasnt
overly
enamored
with
this
one
but
it
was
my
first
exposure
to
imperial
pilsner
style
and
the
beer
did
get
better
as
a
drank
down
the
750
i
normally
turn
to
the
60
minute
as
my
standby
but
this
one
gives
it
a
run
for
the
money
absolutely
worth
trying
drinkability
and
overall
impression
at
the
beginning
i
wasnt
all
that
certain
i
liked
this
beer
but
the
more
of
it
had
the
better
i
liked
it
one
sip
followed
the
last
quite
easily
my
overall
impression
is
of
an
interesting
take
on
the
pilsner
style
and
one
that
ill
enjoy
occasionally
that
said
however
ill
continue
to
prefer
pils
style
beers
such
as
the
prima
stoudts
sunshine
and
pikeland
from
the
breweries
of
se
pa
overall
definitely
a
beer
id
seek
out
again
a
hazy
dirty
golden
a
large
amount
of
head
formed
and
had
great
retention
all
the
way
too
the
end
the
nose
has
a
pungent
hop
aroma
earthy
and
musty
at
first
but
soon
some
lemony
citrus
cuts
through
a
lot
of
sweet
pilsner
malt
is
present
flavor
is
very
sweet
but
with
a
huge
lemon
hop
character
that
transitions
to
earthyhay
then
piney
bitter
on
the
finish
has
the
mouthfeel
of
an
imperial
ipa
along
with
the
hop
character
but
the
malt
is
obviously
lighter
from
using
pilsner
this
was
an
interesting
mix
of
hop
flavors
put
together
over
such
a
light
but
thick
body
interesting
to
try
this
one
time
overall
i
enjoyed
this
one
quite
a
bit
and
would
definitely
have
it
again
slainte
and
happy
independence
day
overall
had
this
side
by
side
to
the
birra
del
borgo
version
and
i
like
this
is
bit
better
slightly
more
crisp
and
refreshing
easy
drinking
too
probably
more
akin
to
an
ipa
than
a
pilsner
the
malt
profile
is
crisp
clean
large
and
on
one
side
of
the
field
whereas
the
americaneuropean
hop
flavors
are
on
the
other
side
battling
for
dominance
a
good
beer
throughout
but
there
seems
to
be
an
offset
in
balance
and
contrast
in
identity
kinda
schizophrenic
o
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
pilsners
but
this
is
really
a
great
tasting
beer
i
enjoy
drinking
it
and
would
consider
this
a
nice
goto
beer
when
having
some
light
pasta
and
lighter
style
foods
this
beer
is
awesome
two
finger
head
of
white
foam
with
lots
of
cling
from
the
lace
the
color
is
a
very
slightly
cloudy
6
on
the
srm
beer
color
chart
lots
of
micro
bubble
action
smell
is
that
of
grapefruit
pine
nut
lemon
peel
malt
black
pepper
and
roasted
wheat
taste
is
to
almost
steal
for
more
with
lots
and
lots
of
hops
in
the
forefront
as
the
taste
of
pink
grapefruit
and
lemon
peel
there
also
flavors
of
black
pepper
wheat
weak
coffee
sweetness
of
orange
and
malt
mouthfeel
is
full
and
creamy
with
a
crispness
in
the
front
and
a
slight
drying
in
the
back
good
beer
wonderful
hop
flavor
and
the
buzz
is
just
a
fabulous
wave
of
buzz
i
am
going
out
to
get
a
few
more
once
i
sober
up
while
many
examples
of
this
style
expand
on
a
regular
pilsner
this
is
more
of
a
distillation
of
key
flavors
bare
bones
but
intense
and
sharply
honed
cuts
right
through
spicy
food
overall
more
of
an
occasional
treat
than
an
everyday
beer
overall
nicely
done
brew
somewhere
between
a
stronger
common
and
strong
pils
i
didnt
even
want
to
finish
the
1012
oz
pour
of
this
one
i
actually
handed
the
thing
off
to
a
friend
an
ordered
something
else
maybe
im
just
a
crisp
noble
hop
type
of
pilsner
guy
o
i
typically
stay
away
from
pilsners
because
of
their
lack
of
body
and
flavor
however
this
one
takes
the
cake
i
purchased
it
because
of
the
comment
on
the
label
that
it
is
continually
hoped
and
it
stands
by
its
words
and
i
am
a
big
fan
of
dogfish
head
beers
this
is
a
beer
that
is
perfect
light
lovers
and
hopheads
alike
bravo
sam
calagione
another
great
beer
out

slight

medium

with
light
carbonation
a
pilsener
that
feel
like
a
pale
with
that
hop
presence
a
good
touch
overall
i
personally
think
this
beer
seems
slightly
overhyped
and
definitely
overpriced
paid
10
for
a
bomber
it
is
very
unique
and
complex
i
just
dont
think
the
overall
taste
is
that
spectacular
still
a
good
beer
worth
trying
ive
sampled
2
of
the
imperialdouble
pilsners
so
far
and
havent
been
overly
impressed
overall
solid
brew
i
was
impressed
yet
again
by
dfh
the
beer
pours
a
bright
clear
amber
with
a
big
fluffy
white
head
big
bubbles
with
noticeable
carbonation
rising
to
the
top
the
head
was
well
retained
and
lasted
throughout
the
beer
some
lacing
was
noted
the
beer
has
a
nice
aroma
to
it
well
balanced
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
really
good
again
well
balanced
with
some
pine
hops
noticeable
the
beer
had
a
light
feel
to
it
with
good
carbonation
the
beer
was
clean
crisp
and
very
enjoyable
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
and
one
that
i
look
forward
to
trying
again
o
an
absolutely
beautiful
imperial
pilsner
spot
on
with
hops
throughout
incredibly
smooth
crisp
and
refreshing
o
pilsner
more
like
an
ipa
crossed
with
a
esb
but
im
not
complaining
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
heavy
as
expected
but
smooth
and
relatively
easy
to
drink
put
it
all
together
and
this
is
a
fairly
potent
brew
that
can
sneak
up
on
you
pretty
easily
due
to
its
easy
drinking
nature
o
this
beer
stays
clean
dry
and
crisp
with
having
just
a
touch
of
sweetness
to
the
pale
malt
and
a
full
hops
flavor
that
is
nice
and
pungent
with
very
little
bitterness
this
drinks
like
a
beer
half
its
abv
o
very
well
done
and
i
would
have
liked
to
have
had
2
o
i
believe
relying
on
saaz
rather
than
pnw
varietals
would
have
made
this
a
better
beer
dfh
mentions
the
use
of
noble
verities
but
they
are
definitely
in
the
background
dont
get
me
wrong
the
brew
is
tasty
as
is
but
is
hardly
identifiable
as
a
pils
d
nice
id
order
another
and
might
buy
again
a
good
ipl
finished
the
bomber
myself
perfect
beer
for
a
nice
hop
craving
certainly
hoppier
than
i
expected
from
dfh
and
this
beer
wasnt
all
that
imperial
to
ruin
the
experience
o
overall
a
decent
beer
the
flavors
are
a
bit
bland
and
heavy
on
the
hops
making
it
taste
more
like
a
pale
ale
or
ipa
id
prefer
a
bit
more
of
a
pilsner
taste
to
the
beer
poured
from
a
750ml
bottle
into
a
duvel
tulip
glass
this
brew
poured
a
bright
amber
color
with
a
3
finger
foamy
white
head
medium
high
carbonation
and
little
bitter
hoppiness
gives
this
beer
a
crisp
character
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
a
slight
slickness
this
beer
smells
mildlow
levels
of
hoppy
citrus
and
pine
are
noticeable
there
are
also
aromas
of
sweet
malt
and
a
mild
grassiness
the
flavor
is
a
good
balance
between
hoppy
bitterness
and
malty
sweetness
there
are
notes
of
bread
and
hint
of
spices
and
the
finish
is
bitter
sweet
and
long
lasting
overall
a
very
unique
beer
that
i
greatly
enjoyed
i
rarely
drink
pilsners
but
if
they
all
were
like
this
one
that
would
probably
change
ill
be
seeking
this
one
out
again
oi
have
never
had
an
imperial
pilsner
before
this
one
and
i
fully
enjoyed
this
beer
another
interesting
delicious
beer
from
dogfish
head
d
low
due
to
the
abv
content
decent
beer
refreshing
and
kinda
sneaky
i
tend
to
drink
hiefes
and
pils
fast
and
this
one
got
me
decently
doozy
o
yes
deserves
more
than
one
but
be
careful
this
one
is
deceiving
and
very
quaffable
4
5
even
poured
slow
this
head
is
a
behemoth
thick
rocky
eggshell
head
patches
all
over
body
is
slightly
cloudy
pilsneryellow
looks
delicious
smell
is
candy
hops
and
a
lot
of
sugary
sweetness
taste
has
a
nice
bready
and
haylike
backbone
but
the
hops
shine
through
and
show
their
muscle
grassy
complex
hops
that
stay
on
the
aftertaste
a
tad
bit
of
heat
on
the
end
but
its
expected
for
an
imperial
offering
such
as
this
sticky
afterfinish
very
good
beer
a
nice
take
on
the
style
but
i
believe
id
prefer
odell
imp
pils
or
sam
adams
or
for
sure
a
fresh
prima
pils
the
predominant
grapefruit
makes
me
think
west
coast
ipa
meets
pils
finish
a
tad
dry
but
very
drinkable
because
of
the
good
carbonation
of
this
beer
lots
of
good
flavor
here
overall
is
a
good
beer
that
ill
probably
end
up
grabbing
again
if
they
dropped
the
price
just
a
hair
and
put
these
in
6
or
4
packs
id
be
all
over
it
what
a
great
beer
by
df
this
is
a
good
representation
of
the
hardest
beer
to
perfect
did
they
perfect
it
i
will
leave
that
up
to
you
o
not
for
the
fainthearted
or
for
standard
pils
fans
at
all
hopheads
dream
however
pairings
probably
nothing
but
why
ruin
a
superb
beer
with
food
anyways
pours
into
my
dfh
snifter
a
slightly
hazy
light
amber
color
with
about
an
inch
of
creamy
white
head
and
decent
lacing
aroma
is
light
some
hops
a
bit
of
grass
some
yeast
maybe
some
lemon
peel
mouthfeel
is
of
a
medium
body
taste
is
of
yeast
a
bit
of
hops
maybe
a
hint
of
spice
this
is
my
second
attempt
at
this
brew
i
am
still
unimpressed
it
tastes
like
a
slightly
better
version
of
a
cheap
mass
produced
pilsner
o
a
good
and
unique
lager
not
just
your
typical
run
of
the
mill
lager
but
coming
from
dogfish
head
what
would
you
expect
in
my
opinion
i
think
the
10
price
tag
is
a
little
steep
for
this
brew
tho
overall
is
this
is
a
very
nice
refreshing
imperial
pilsner
very
enjoyable
o
very
tasty
beer
albeit
a
bit
hot
for
me
if
i
had
tasted
this
before
i
bought
i
might
reconsider
the
12
purchase
still
glad
ive
tried
it
d
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
this
drinks
rather
nicely
i
am
impressed
o
in
a
blind
taste
test
id
be
more
inclined
to
call
this
a
dfh
30min
ipa
than
a
pils
but
on
whole
the
brew
is
refreshing
with
nice
clean
flavors
i
definitely
enjoyed
it
the
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
with
a
slightly
below
average
carbonation
this
goes
down
easily
and
is
very
easy
to
drink
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
with
high
drinkability
and
great
flavors
this
is
an
impressive
imperial
pilsner
o
not
bad
but
not
worth
the
price
go
with
prima
pils
or
sunshine
pils
d
tasty
goes
down
very
easily
not
too
filling
good
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
nice
beer
with
flavor
and
substance
making
it
worth
drinking
for
a
long
time
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
and
will
definitely
be
picking
up
more
nice
way
to
kick
back
on
a
warm
day
after
work
or
watching
a
game
im
not
a
big
pilsner
fan
but
this
one
would
be
welcome
with
dinner
any
time
comes
out
of
the
tap
a
clear
amber
with
a
respectable
if
not
persistent
white
head
fairly
strong
aroma
is
malty
and
fruity
with
just
a
hint
of
hops
flavor
is
malty
and
has
a
firm
fruity
undertone
that
is
mainly
pear
along
with
more
than
a
hint
of
hops
and
touches
of
both
sweetness
and
bitterness
texture
is
almost
silky
smooth
with
a
subtle
fizz
i
know
that
i
tend
to
be
unfair
to
pilsners
but
i
hope
i
gave
this
one
a
fair
shake
closer
to
medium
body
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
alcohol
seems
pretty
well
hidden
not
a
bad
beer
here
hop
character
is
not
as
strong
as
i
would
have
thought
overalla
home
run
bravo
buy
some
perfect
complement
to
the
capsrangers
game
thats
on
right
now
pours
a
golden
yellow
with
a
huge
thick
fluffy
white
head
awesome
lacing
and
stays
throughout
aroma
of
grass
pepper
and
yeast
flavor
starts
off
with
some
nice
sweet
grass
notes
and
bready
yeast
hay
and
a
bit
of
lemon
zest
as
well
nice
citrus
and
floral
hops
in
this
roided
up
pilsner
ends
with
big
pepper
notes
and
other
spices
im
pleasantly
surprised
with
this
one
flavor
is
outstanding
for
a
pils
yet
the
body
remains
lighter
than
suggested
by
the
rich
taste
drinkability
is
good
an
enjoyable
beer
overall
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
pilsners
the
flavors
all
work
together
well
and
the
slight
bitterness
at
the
end
is
perfect
for
this
beer
mouthfeel
drinkability
a
slight
ethanol
taste
on
the
swallow
can
sometimes
take
away
from
the
earth
and
grass
notes
light
bodied
and
easy
to
drink
in
a
flash
a
good
beer
but
nothing
fantastic
the
flavor
is
very
deceiving
at
first
it
has
the
body
and
the
initial
flavor
of
a
big
pilsner
but
then
you
are
immediately
hit
with
lots
of
earthy
hops
and
grass
a
bit
of
citrus
comes
through
toward
the
end
and
then
it
finishes
out
with
a
bit
of
peppery
spice
its
good
and
rather
unique
but
not
exactly
amazing
a
sipping
and
enjoying
type
of
beer
worth
the
time
to
enjoy
od
its
a
tasty
brew
but
cant
entirely
recommend
it
kind
of
a
weird
beer
and
style
maybe
freshness
was
an
issue
not
sure
just
wondering
im
a
bit
surprised
at
how
much
i
like
this
beer
and
not
for
the
reasons
that
i
thought
i
would
be
try
it
if
you
can
find
it
draft
sampled
at
kickbcaks
poured
into
a
small
snifter
glass
a
clear
straw
colored
golden
color
with
a
white
collared
head
slightly
fruity
grape
aroma
but
very
light
otherwise
some
wheat
and
mild
citrus
light
mouthfeel
light
fruit
like
start
with
citrus
notes
and
some
bitterness
this
one
has
a
nice
balance
between
bitter
and
sweet
bitterness
lingers
and
reminds
me
of
almost
a
lime
rind
flavor
o
i
was
looking
for
just
a
good
drinkable
beer
tonight
and
this
fit
the
bill
and
delivered
this
will
be
awesome
on
a
hot
springsummer
day
overall
a
nice
lager
departure
for
usually
alecentric
dogfish
head
id
like
to
see
some
more
lagers
out
of
milton
o
overall
this
is
a
good
brew
nothing
too
crazy
but
the
hops
added
to
the
pilsner
is
a
nice
touch
the
dfh
feel
is
there
and
it
works
nicely
for
this
brew

thanks
chris
for
sharing
if
im
ever
in
a
place
where
primas
not
available
but
this
beer
is
i
wont
hesitate
for
a
second
it
was
a
real
pleasure
to
drink
and
it
would
be
very
easy
to
sit
back
and
enjoy
several
of
these
in
one
sitting
on
a
nice
warm
spring
night
id
love
to
pick
up
a
big
bottle
and
see
how
it
compares
overall
enjoyment
for
me
is
very
high
i
love
this
beer
a
big
winner
for
dfh
notes
im
glad
that
its
not
that
high
in
terms
of
abv
like
some
other
imperial
lagers
out
there
the
hops
in
this
beer
are
intense
and
actually
almost
make
this
pilsner
a
sipping
beer
i
prefer
this
beer
over
something
like
st
krampus
because
if
i
recall
correctly
this
has
a
greater
pils
malt
character
to
balance
the
extreme
hops
i
was
quite
surprised
how
little
hop
presence
this
had
especially
considering
the
branding
and
style
while
i
wasnt
expecting
a
hop
overload
like
an
imperial
ipa
would
give
me
i
still
wanted
more
from
this
judging
the
beer
for
the
style
taking
a
pilsner
and
amplifying
its
qualities
this
is
spot
on
it
may
catch
some
people
off
guard
by
the
overall
mildness
of
the
hops
and
increase
in
the
grains
though
its
still
a
devilishly
tasty
beer
great
drinkability
i
was
worried
that
dfhs
imperial
take
on
such
a
session
style
would
kill
its
drinkability
but
that
wasnt
the
case
i
look
forward
to
buying
more
of
this
love
the
balance
a
pleasant
surprise
sometimes
the
imperial
label
is
used
as
an
excuse
for
a
big
unbalance
beer
this
time
it
is
not
maybe
the
well
maybe
not
stealth
way
the
alcohol
took
hold
had
some
influence
but
i
found
my
antonia
to
be
one
lovely
highoctane
pilsner
highly
recommended
this
is
my
first
imperial
pilsner
and
while
im
looking
forward
to
trying
others
the
bar
has
been
set
fairly
high
nice
soft
mild
easy
to
drink
beer
very
crisp
and
refreshing
yet
with
a
creamy
edge
its
a
nice
golden
copper
with
a
white
fluffy
head
great
retention
and
lace
the
smell
is
faint
but
it
mostly
floral
with
hints
of
grass
and
a
touch
of
pine
soft
pale
malts
in
the
the
front
with
a
slight
syrupy
sweetness
followed
with
a
touch
of
earthy
hops
a
hint
of
citrus
and
pine
nothing
bitter
in
the
back
very
mild
easy
to
drink
and
crisp
and
refreshing
alcohol
well
hidden
very
nicely
balanced
beer
this
beer
is
def
worth
trying
ive
never
been
let
down
by
these
guys
overall
i
remain
unsure
as
to
what
constitutes
a
traditional
imperial
pilsner
in
any
event
this
beer
seems
to
fit
the
bill
and
is
a
nicely
done
beer
worth
a
shot
very
well
put
together
big
pilsener
here
tasty
and
highly
drinkable
excellent
and
at
only
7
99
for
the
bottle
one
that
is
worth
having
in
reserve
formthat
summer
evening
with
friends
the
classic
pilsner
pale
golden
body
was
highly
effervescent
and
the
head
was
a
good
four
finger
thick
the
smell
was
very
hoppy
with
some
clove
hay
and
faint
hint
of
smoke
the
taste
was
departure
from
a
pilsner
due
to
the
high
hop
content
which
showed
up
as
a
mix
of
bitter
and
spicy
flavors
there
was
a
lemon
twist
taste
in
the
finish
and
some
alcohol
warmth
after
each
sip
not
exactly
a
quenching
beer
but
the
complex
profile
and
creamy
mouthfeel
made
me
want
to
keep
drinking
hard
to
tell
this
was
a
lager
until
you
knew
beforehand
and
then
the
lack
of
residual
sugars
was
a
bit
more
apparent
o
a
fantastic
brew
perfect
for
introducing
that
lightbeerchugging
skeptic
you
know
to
the
world
of
craft
brewing
this
is
the
best
pilsner
ive
ever
had
hands
down
cheers
the
beer
pours
a
golden
color
with
the
slightest
haziness
the
head
looks
fluffy
and
tastes
creamy
and
lasts
well
into
the
beer
nice
lacing
smells
like
fresh
rising
dough
and
is
balanced
with
a
good
earthy
hops
slightly
sweet
malt
upfront
sweet
with
some
a
bit
of
spice
towards
the
end
finishes
with
long
lasting
pungent
flavors
which
are
surprisingly
quite
good
it
is
medium
bodied
and
coats
the
mouth
nice
a
beer
i
could
drink
in
many
situations
a
great
version
of
pils
spiced
up
a
bit
pours
a
pretty
golden
brown
with
hints
of
orange
sunset
big
fluffy
head
that
sticks
around
even
half
through
the
beer
leaving
nice
lacing
in
its
wake
nose
has
some
sweet
bready
malts
some
spiciness
almost
fresh
backed
cinnamon
roll
and
some
light
pine
forest
taste
is
a
nice
hoppy
bitterness
with
caramel
malts
for
the
style
a
tasty
beer
finish
is
dry
and
a
bit
astrigent
but
cleans
up
decently
well
for
the
next
sip
i
was
happy
with
the
purchase
a
nice
example
of
an
imperial
pilsner
and
for
the
limited
choices
in
the
category
a
good
one
to
make
cheers
o
certainly
not
the
worst
imperial
pilsner
that
ive
tried
i
found
it
easy
to
finish
my
glass
and
enjoyed
the
next
one
too
the
750ml
bottle
size
is
perfect
for
a
person
if
thats
all
they
want
in
an
evening
o
a
wonderfully
balanced
complex
pilsner
that
rivals
any
other
pilsner
for
top
dog
its
the
perfect
beer
for
a
springtime
evening
or
a
cool
summer
night
i
was
sad
when
i
had
reached
the
bottom
of
my
bomber
bottle
tasty
high
drinkability
the
7
5
is
well
hidden
nice
contri
to
the
dfh
lineup
in
the
nonextreme
space
and
i
do
loves
the
extremes
too
pours
a
clear
straw
in
color
soapy
head
and
a
bit
fizzy
at
that
bright
and
clarity
is
good
retention
is
decent
and
some
lace
is
noted
suggestions
of
lemon
grass
and
green
hop
in
the
nose
and
taste
very
smooth
on
the
palate
crisp
and
also
belgianesque
in
its
carbonation
a
touch
of
hop
this
ale
tastes
like
a
big
clean
pils
does
not
taste
like
a
euro
style
pils
distinctly
american
despite
the
origins
and
name
good
feel
and
overall
interesting
and
well
made
a
successful
beer
and
would
love
to
have
again
great
pils
very
enjoyable
not
too
bitter
strong
for
a
pils
anyway
but
hides
it
well
this
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
bright
gold
color
a
pretty
epic
amount
of
bright
white
head
retains
its
shape
quite
well
not
much
in
the
aroma
department
hints
of
copper
and
a
slight
hint
of
hops
a
nice
clean
front
crisp
with
just
a
bit
of
honey
the
finish
is
dry
with
a
very
very
minimal
hop
presence
but
its
there
is
you
look
for
it
these
guys
continue
to
be
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
ever
this
while
not
anything
totally
out
of
the
box
is
still
a
super
delicious
beer
that
is
worth
trying
at
least
once
quite
wellbalanced
with
an
alcohol
level
that
is
hidden
very
well
until
it
sneaks
up
on
you
of
course
a
bit
heavier
and
more
pungent
than
a
regular
pils
such
is
to
be
expected
from
an
imperialized
version
of
the
style
and
this
one
pulls
it
off
very
well
taking
all
of
the
bits
of
a
good
pilsner
and
extrapolating
upon
them
subtlety
is
not
its
main
suit
but
toned
down
subtlety
would
be
the
name
of
the
game
this
is
definitely
a
topnotch
example
of
what
it
means
for
an
american
brewery
to
take
a
classic
staple
and
give
it
a
bigger
bolder
flair
the
taste
starts
with
a
mouth
full
of
carbonation
with
a
sweet
and
pungent
hop
flavor
the
hops
are
earthy
grassy
with
a
slight
spicyness
nice
overall
a
pretty
tasty
imperial
pils
if
they
made
6ers
of
this
i
think
it
would
be
a
big
hit
could
be
a
springsummer
seasonal
to
rival
sam
adams
noble
pils
bottle
poured
into
a
snifter
this
is
a
clear
golden
color
very
fizzy
with
a
foamy
head
smell
is
heavy
on
crisp
foresty
hops
and
cereals
taste
is
hoppy
with
more
cereals
and
a
somewhat
soapy
finish
mouthfeel
foamy
fizzy
and
soapy
excellent
drinkability
get
this
yummy
pilsner
overall
a
basic
pilsner
jacked
up
on
hops
nothing
extreme
just
a
twist
on
ths
style
a
decent
change
easy
to
drink
and
flavorful
the
bitterness
takes
a
few
drinks
to
get
used
to
but
its
solid
pilsner
is
not
my
favorite
but
i
found
this
drinkiable
and
would
be
a
great
bbq
or
hot
summer
day
drink
d
solid
and
distinctive
i
enjoyed
this
quite
a
bit
and
unlike
a
few
of
dfhs
750ml
offerings
its
pretty
reasonably
priced
so
you
can
give
it
a
try
without
too
much
of
a
hit
to
your
bank
account
taste
is
exactly
the
same
followed
by
a
touch
of
hop
bitterness
drinks
smoothly
with
very
light
flavors
and
can
be
enjoyed
during
any
season
this
is
the
highest
abv
of
any
pilsner
ive
ever
had
and
in
my
very
humble
opinion
i
can
finally
do
justice
in
reviewing
this
style
of
beer
it
needs
that
extra
kick
of
heat
thank
you
dfh
i
would
definitely
buy
this
beer
again
o
this
is
a
great
beer
alot
of
dfh
are
too
experimental
for
me
this
is
not
this
is
just
a
straight
up
pilsner
lager
just
jacked
up
and
done
right
hazy
golden
color
with
a
white
head
spicy
earthy
hops
aroma
with
grain
and
fruit
grain
and
hops
dominate
the
taste
big
mouth
feel
with
some
warming
alcohol
pretty
smooth
and
clean
which
makes
it
very
easy
to
drink
runs
slightly
hot
for
only
7
5
percent
but
i
guess
the
beauty
of
the
pilsner
is
its
simplicity
so
its
harder
to
mask
o
this
is
only
my
second
adventure
into
the
imperial
pilsner
style
and
the
first
ive
reviewed
i
dont
know
exactly
what
is
being
looked
for
here
but
the
beer
is
good
i
wish
i
had
another
a
huge
improvement
over
golden
showers
i
can
seek
more
of
this
i
like
this
beer
even
so
pilsener
is
not
my
favorite
style
the
brew
is
flawless
like
i
said
huge
foamy
head
lovely
lace
its
most
redeeming
quality
is
hiding
the
booze
taste
there
isnt
much
considering
how
wimpy
the
flavor
is
i
would
have
like
more
finishing
hops
a
stink
still
i
will
enjoy
the
rest
dont
refuse
this
if
someone
offers
but
i
wont
buy
it
again
o
if
i
must
rate
to
style
and
i
feel
i
must
i
have
to
subtract
points
for
a
cloudy
appearance
an
alelike
body
and
not
enough
crisp
carbonation
otherwise
a
very
tasty
beer
drinkability
was
decent
the
750ml
was
a
tad
to
much
for
me
but
overall
a
good
beer
and
reasonably
priced
o
another
very
drinkable
brew
from
dfh
lager
has
never
been
my
favorite
style
but
dfh
hit
one
out
of
the
park
again
with
this
clean
and
crisp
beer
drinkable
yep
pours
a
clean
bright
cold
color
bubbly
white
head
with
good
retention
and
lacing
scent
is
hop
forward
with
citrus
floral
and
a
touch
of
piney
hops
backbone
is
light
and
clean
pilsner
malt
taste
brings
the
hops
first
but
not
as
aggressively
as
scent
dictates
solid
pilsner
malt
body
that
doesnt
ge
tlost
behind
the
hops
medium
bodied
smooth
clean
a
nice
suprise
as
the
hops
and
malt
work
very
well
together
opinion
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
overall
and
i
was
surprised
that
it
wasnt
just
an
imperial
ipa
brewed
with
german
hops
and
malt
this
beer
actually
comes
across
as
a
pilsner
which
is
a
little
surprising
to
me
i
didnt
realize
that
i
had
some
preconceptions
of
what
to
expect
but
i
guess
i
did
this
beer
shattered
them
and
proved
to
be
what
it
is
a
pilsner
d
nicely
drinkable
we
had
no
problem
with
the
bottle
not
particularly
memorable
though
i
wont
be
looking
for
this
again
overall
this
is
a
great
pils
you
would
guess
this
is
a
higher
abv
pils
until
its
too
late
good
beer
well
worth
a
try
d
im
not
a
big
pilsner
fan
but
given
dogfish
heads
unique
brewing
approach
had
to
try
this
not
a
bad
brew
flavors
are
woven
well
throughout
the
brew
d
my
wife
and
i
are
drinking
this
one
she
likes
it
id
pass
on
another
one
still
another
good
venture
by
these
brewery
d
this
beer
has
great
drinkability
it
goes
down
easy
and
the
flavor
is
great
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
and
im
glad
that
i
picked
it
up
i
recommend
picking
this
one
up
it
is
a
very
nice
representation
of
this
style
d
drinks
well
enough
but
nothing
too
special
here
pretty
much
just
a
high
abv
pilsner
i
also
like
the
fact
that
this
is
unquestionably
imperial
but
at
7
5
not
as
high
as
others
that
have
been
seen
in
this
style
this
is
a
good
strength
for
this
beer
d
this
one
did
not
blow
me
out
of
the
water
this
was
a
good
pilsner
i
expected
a
little
more
west
coast
hop
flavor
and
something
different
coming
from
dogfish
head
but
like
i
said
dont
get
me
wrong
this
was
a
good
beer
this
beer
poured
a
clear
gold
color
and
formed
a
nice
big
foamy
off
white
head
that
coated
the
sides
with
lace
a
medium
amount
of
carbonation
is
present
and
it
looks
like
a
float
an
aroma
of
grain
light
hops
lemon
and
pepper
the
favor
was
of
malt
hop
bread
and
lemon
with
a
hint
of
pepper
the
body
is
light
and
the
finish
slightly
astringent
the
mouthfeel
feels
medium
bodied
and
wellcarbonated
but
theres
a
bit
of
a
hop
stickiness
that
i
find
a
little
bit
out
of
place
with
the
balanced
flavor
profile
the
drinkability
is
very
good
as
well
im
glad
dogfish
has
a
lager
out
in
production
of
course
its
very
big
and
very
dogfish
but
its
still
great
clear
golden
color
with
a
thick
foamy
white
head
aromas
of
earthy
grains
and
fresh
dough
with
some
grass
too
taste
is
firm
and
very
dry
from
a
dominant
profile
of
hops
quite
bitter
and
not
the
softer
easydrinking
grain
flavors
that
one
might
expect
in
a
pilsner
it
is
pleasant
to
drink
but
bone
dry
given
the
onedimensional
and
bitter
flavor
profile
i
think
it
would
be
better
matched
with
some
ripe
cheese
and
fruit
rather
than
as
a
standalone
pours
a
light
gold
huge
fluffy
head
doesnt
recede
had
some
hop
scents
some
bready
notes
this
was
not
what
i
was
expecting
from
a
pilsner
but
not
in
bad
way
more
hoppy
than
i
expected
crisp
and
did
follow
through
with
some
biscuity
essence
the
mouthfeel
was
crisp
and
is
a
drinkable
pilsner
a
nice
offering
from
dfh
notes
this
is
just
an
outstanding
lager
beer
and
i
would
highly
recommend
this
to
anyone
poured
into
a
dfh
glass
a
very
nice
hazy
golden
yellow
color
nice

very
nice
twofinger

with
some
very
nice
sticky

some
nice

the
taste
is
slightly
sweet

with

medium

nice
drybitter
finish
drinkable
a
very
nice
brew
glad
ive
gotten
a
chance
to
try
it
d
i
loved
this
pilsner
great
beer
from
dogfish
will
buy
it
every
time
great
drinkability
and
very
flavorful
for
a
style
that
doesnt
usually
get
this
hopped
up
good
for
a
pilsner
i
suppose
but
the
taste
isnt
too
refined
or
memorable
not
too
drinkable
either
by
the
way
i
drank
this
beer
alongside
a
freshly
made
bowl
of
smoked
tomato
soup
with
bacon
and
a
provolone
gouda
grilled
cheese
dogfish
makes
wonderful
ales
of
all
sorts
but
their
first
lager
offering
leaves
a
bitter
taste
in
my
mouth
literally
and
figuratively
why
not
try
something
a
little
simpler
and
work
your
way
up
to
the
extreme
pilsner
when
you
get
that
mastered
my
antonia
pours
with
a
cloudy
amber
color
with
a
creamy
frothy
head
you
can
smell
the
hops
right
off
the
top
of
the
pour
as
it
went
into
the
glass
it
was
a
clean
smooth
drink
with
the
nice
bite
of
hops
but
not
too
much
where
your
taste
buds
are
hurting
it
is
a
smooth
drink
from
first
sip
to
bottom
of
the
glass
the
extra
kick
is
the
higher
abv
which
is
needed
here
i
think
if
it
was
lower
the
beer
would
suffer
dogfish
can
really
brew
their
ales
but
this
proves
they
know
how
to
really
brew
a
lager
just
as
well
amazing
mouthfeel
doesnt
feel
light
at
all
and
the
7
5
alcohol
is
covered
up
as
much
as
possible
for
a
lighter
pale
beer
its
covered
up
so
well
and
you
dont
that
typical
beery
alcohol
yeasty
taste
youd
get
from
most
lower
quality
pilsners
this
is
like
a
german
ipa
and
i
really
wish
they
could
brew
more
of
this
one
year
round
with
that
being
said
this
beer
deserves
way
more
notice
than
it
gets
tastesweet
mildly
toasted
malt
leading
to
a
bit
of
a
hoppy
bite
in
the
finish
seems
like
a
pale
alepilsner
hybrid
a
bit
more
on
the
subtle
side
as
i
was
expecting
a
big
dose
of
saaz
hops
and
more
fuller
flavor
good
stuff
love
an
imperial
pilsner
and
this
one
is
interesting
d
probably
because
of
my
like
of
ipas
i
could
drink
this
all
day
the
highish
abv
is
hidden
well
also
would
be
cool
to
find
this
on
tap
somewhere
i
would
certainly
drink
it
just
dont
see
as
a
imperial
pilsner
that
ive
had
could
have
had
bad
examples
this
is
an
easy
drinking
well
balanced
beer
seems
a
bit
sweet
for
the
style
id
like
to
see
it
somewhat
drier
and
more
bitter
overall
though
this
beer
would
go
great
with
dinner
or
as
something
to
drink
while
watching
sports
overall
a
very
nice
and
easy
to
drink
imperial
pilsener
highly
sessionable
despite
the
abv
cheers
d
very
drinkable
not
as
complex
as
i
though
it
would
be
but
still
pretty
good
d
im
not
usually
a
pilsner
drinker
but
this
is
really
nice
great
mix
of
flavors
and
very
well
balanced
very
easy
to
drink
bottle
pours
hazygolden
with
a
short
lived
white
head
and
lovely
carbonation

musty

hoppy
full
crisp

biscuit

is
balanced
on
the
palate
by
herbal

with
hints
of
orange
fruit
pleasant
long
hoppy
finish
nice
delicious
brew
d
really
quite
drinkable
but
i
dont
think
ill
go
back
to
it
smooth
mediumbodied
mouthfeel
with
prickly
carbonation
decent
drinkability
d
the
booze
was
just
too
distracting
for
me
to
really
enjoy
this
bottle
this
was
my
first
offering
of
a
double
pils
maybe
i
am
just
not
used
to
the
style
but
to
me
this
was
too
sweet
and
not
very
good
in
the
drinkability
department
im
really
impressed
by
this
beer
its
big
on
flavor
and
very
unique
plus
although
its
an
imperial
its
still
refreshing
a
very
nice
break
from
the
giant
hop
bombs
and
huge
roasted
imperial
stouts
dreally
easy
drinking
i
was
expecting
quite
a
bit
more
bitterness
from
the
other
examples
ive
had
of
this
style
its
a
very
interesting
and
complex
beer
that
im
glad
i
got
to
try
but
not
sure
i
would
purchase
again
d
a
good
imperial
pilsner
smooth
and
crisp
with
an
ample
hop
addition
pretty
good
my
antonia
is
an
impressive
imperial
pilsner
its
not
my
favorite
and
doesnt
come
quite
close
to
displacing
sam
adams
hallertau
pilsner
nonetheless
its
an
impressive
beer
for
the
style
in
terms
of
critiquing
it
i
dont
have
much
to
offer
maybe
add
some
sort
of
citric
hop
i
dont
know
nonetheless
it
really
is
good
as
it
is
definitely
worth
checking
out
dogfish
head
my
antonia
is
a
very
sparkling
slightly
hazy
golden
lager
with
a
huge
pillowy
white
head
that
has
outstanding
retention
and
lacing
it
has
a
doughy
aroma
with
a
little
grass
and
spice
its
pretty
full
bodied
lively
but
smooth
with
a
really
clean
dry
finish
it
has
a
simple
well
hopped
taste
theres
a
leafy
bitterness
its
a
little
sweet
and
a
little
boozy
it
goes
down
real
nice
s
this
is
an
excellent
beer
that
i
liked
a
lot
more
than
i
thought
i
would
its
a
very
enjoyable
beer
to
treat
yourself
to
750ml
bottle
purchased
in
columbus
for
something
like
8
it
pours
a
goldenorange
color
slightly
hazy
with
a
wet
looking
foam
on
top
very
nice
aromatics
this
definitely
has
a
pilsner
base
but
the
hops
are
amped
up
big
time
not
quite
the
same
as
sam
adams
hallertau
but
maybe
a
first
cousin
rather
than
hallertau
hops
this
has
plenty
of
saaz
style
spiciness
also
some
juicy
citrus
that
i
associate
more
with
american
ipas
it
tastes
very
nice
not
really
a
refined
pils
but
rather
more
of
an
agressive
ipa
lasting
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
but
its
a
flavorful
bitterness
so
i
like
it
creamy
mouthfeel
very
good
match
with
the
flavors
overall
an
excellent
beer
id
be
happy
to
have
it
again
any
time
i
found
this
beer
extremely
drinkable
and
am
looking
forward
for
the
next
bottle
d
very
easy
to
drink
and
i
like
it
my
my
my
antoniawhat
a
beergrassy
hop
flavor
this
beer
begs
to
be
savored
clean
finishslightly
cloudy
brew
only
problem
is
the
price
tagbut
found
them
to
be
much
cheaper
in
ny
state
wish
they
would
decide
to
brew
this
year
round
would
be
nice
to
get
this
in
12oz
bottles
the
taste
has
herbal
sweet
and
lightly
malty
qualities
with
low
bitterness
in
the
flavor
and
smooth
lemony
noble
hop
accents
the
gentle
alcohol
flavor
and
spice
provides
some
contrast
to
the
mild
honeylike
tinge
from
the
malt
there
is
a
mild
level
of
fruitiness
and
toasted
elements
in
the
flavor
with
hints
of
floral
noble
hop
tinges
throughout
i
almost
get
a
sweet
golden
delicious
aspsect
from
the
pils
near
the
finish
which
is
probably
yeast
derived
i
find
this
to
be
a
wonderful
imperial
pils
a
beer
i
would
drink
daily
if
given
the
chance
it
is
not
boring
to
me
very
flavorful
and
it
fits
the
style
well
i
would
recommend
this
to
german
pils
fans
and
it
went
well
with
my
brats
with
spicy
dijon
mustard
countering
the
fattiness
well
very
well
done
take
on
the
imperial
pilsner
style
here
with
a
flavorful
and
nicely
balanced
character
that
is
driven
home
by
the
ridiculously
smooth
body
on
this
i
initially
split
this
because
i
thought
that
it
was
going
to
be
a
warm
and
overly
sweet
affair
but
was
pleasantly
surprised
to
find
the
opposite
heck
i
could
have
drunk
this
whole
bottle
my
self
an
excellent
job
by
dogfish
head
keeping
this
one
accessible
despite
the
higher
abv
not
my
favorite
style
but
usually
because
tangy
lager
yeast
takes
over
there
are
some
notable
exceptions
that
are
quite
pleasant
and
id
add
this
one
to
that
list
crisp
and
dry
with
just
a
touch
of
tanginess
and
lots
of
floral
and
some
earthy
hops
pours
a
pale
ambergolden
with
a
somewhat
thin
head
but
some
lacing
as
well
more
tanginess
in
the
nose
more
hops
in
the
flavor
quite
smoothvery
dry
and
quite
enjoyable
d
the
beer
is
rather
drinkable
because
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
from
the
taste
d
easy
drinker
very
refreshing
my
antonia
is
a
nice
pilsner
from
dogfish
but
i
think
i
will
be
sticking
to
their
ales
and
other
offerings
drink
dfh
does
it
again
off
centered
ales
for
off
center
people
i
am
beginning
to
think
i
am
not
normal
not
the
best
pils
in
the
world
but
still
pretty
good
as
its
meant
to
be
different
md
medium
bodied
has
a
slightly
bitter
finish
but
not
a
negative
at
all
very
nice
carbonation
for
a
pilsner
overall
very
enjoyable
one
that
i
will
pick
up
again
for
sure
d
pretty
drinkable
i
am
beginning
to
notice
a
bit
of
an
alcohol
finish
this
is
a
great
beer
containing
all
of
the
traditional
pilsner
characteristics
just
amplified
drather
drinkable
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
a
good
example
of
the
style
but
there
is
better
poured
from
a
750ml
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
nice
thick
one
inch
head
that
lasts
for
about
a
minute
and
just
leaves
its
remains
on
the
side
of
the
glass
smells
like
bread
straight
up
with
a
little
bit
of
citrus
and
hops
tastes
very
much
like
bread
as
well
with
some
hop
flavor
that
i
cant
quite
put
my
hands
on
as
well
as
some
lemon
and
pepper
shines
through
the
alcohol
is
completely
hidden
and
this
is
pretty
drinkable
i
am
rating
this
to
its
style
and
i
feel
that
it
is
one
of
the
best
pilsners
i
have
ever
had
d
dangerously
drinkable
pilsner
lager
at
7
5
abv
this
is
the
rival
to
prima
pils
in
my
mind
for
americanized
pilsners
super
smooth
wellbalanced
and
drinkable
relative
to
its
strength
my
antonia
is
a
brew
id
like
to
have
on
hand
for
any
lagercentric
crowd
i
might
encounter
a
good
brew
to
trump
weaker
pils
or
upstage
german
counterparts
bravo
dfh
its
beers
like
this
that
keep
me
from
totally
ignoring
you
guys
very
drinkableanother
good
one
from
sam
and
gang
d
im
glad
dfh
didnt
do
anything
too
wacky
on
this
its
nearly
perfect
for
the
style
d
not
normally
a
pilsner
fan
but
this
is
delicious
recommend
it
to
anyone
who
likes
light
beers
but
wants
to
up
there
game
it
is
a
good
place
to
start
i
really
liked
this
one
i
still
think
sam
adams
has
the
benchmark
in
the
style
but
this
is
a
close
second
a
tasty
hoppy
imperial
pilsner
helped
by
being
a
very
fresh
sample
alcohol
is
well
hidden
making
this
very
drinkable
nice
one
dogfish
head
d
goes
down
nicely
even
with
food
enjoy
it
with
some
nice
bread
and
olive
oil
and
salt
mmmm
mouthfeel
drinkability
the
body
of
the
beer
is
shy
of
medium
nice
carbonation
helps
break
up
the
beers
body
again
an
excellent
play
between
sweet
and
dry
this
balance
is
at
the
crux
of
the
beers
excellent
drinkability
the
beer
avoids
an
alcoholic
cough
syrup
feel
and
is
really
a
treat
750
ml
bottle
served
in
a
pilsner
glass
the
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
gold
color
with
an
inch
and
a
half
frothy
white
head
head
retention
and
lacing
are
both
pretty
good
aroma
is
bready
malt
along
with
some
grassy
spicy
and
citrusy
hops
i
think
the
brew
tastes
similar
to
the
aroma
but
with
the
addition
of
a
bit
of
peppery
spice
also
i
think
the
grassy
hop
and
bready
malt
flavors
are
the
strongest
theres
also
a
good
slightly
bitter
hoppy
finish
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
a
little
bit
creamy
and
has
good
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
its
an
easy
and
enjoyable
brew
to
drink
i
think
its
a
solid
overall
brew
id
buy
it
again
in
the
future
overall
ive
always
loved
hoppy
pilsners
yet
there
is
something
about
my
antonia
which
just
isnt
doing
it
for
me
i
need
to
seek
out
other
imperial
pilsners
for
comparison
im
sure
ill
give
this
another
shot
sometime
in
the
future
this
is
one
well
balanced
hoppy
double
pilsner
nice
medium
carbonation
avoids
being
too
sparkly
the
body
is
medium
and
never
syrupy
the
finish
is
clean
and
dry
with
some
malty
graininess
and
mild
bitterness
lingering
my
antonia
is
drinkable
but
nothing
exceptional
pretty
nice
for
an
imperial
well
crafted
and
balanced
but
id
like
more
distinction
drinkable
especially
for
the
abv
notes
a
fine
craft
beer
from
a
great
craft
brewer
there
are
no
surprises
with
my
antonia
just
a
really
wellcrafted
representation
of
the
style
drinkability
is
done
with
great
ease
in
general
not
to
mention
the
respectably
moderate
abv
recommended
d
very
tasty
solid
hop
flavor
with
being
too
bitter
nice
that
segues
conveniently
into
the
thesis
of
this
review
hence
the
style
kind
of
an
oxymoron
to
take
a
style
thats
all
about
precision
mutate
it
but
i
like
the
results
nonetheless
not
hard
to
drink
but
im
not
sure
the
flavor
notes
justify
the
alcohol
it
took
me
a
little
bit
but
im
feeling
this
one
maybe
one
to
share
d
dangerously
so
pours
a
hazy
golden
yellow
to
straw
color
with
a
thick
four
to
five
finger
head
which
resedes
to
a
smaller
head
and
leaves
rings
of
lace
up
and
down
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
big
pilsner
malt
character
with
a
slight
citrus
smell
the
taste
is
of
a
nice
big
pilsner
malt
backbone
with
citrus
notes
and
a
nice
earthy
hop
balance
the
mouthfeel
is
of
a
nice
carbonation
and
is
slightly
creamy
the
drinkability
is
very
high
an
easy
drink
along
with
a
great
complex
flavor
d
this
beer
is
very
crisp
smooth
and
very
good
it
has
just
the
right
amount
of
hops
and
sweetness
making
it
a
nicely
balanced
beer
not
surprising
from
the
great

a

that
is
all
i
can

murky

with

blasting
out
the

knowing
dogfish
they
used
a
ton
of
this
variety
and
it
shows
in
smell
and
taste
some
tropics
and
bubblegum
as
well
this
tastes
a
lot
better
than
many
imy
pilz
out
there
they
just
dont
cut
the
mustard
antonia
gets
the
job
done
while
remaining
in
style
with
a
big
back
tastes
include
pilsner
malt
up
front
light
fruits
a
nice
faint
earthy
hopping
with
some
tropics
this
bottle
is
about
5
months
old
at
this
point
i
like
how
the
hay
i
get
in
alot
of
pilsners
is
muted
here
the
feel
is
a
nice
medium
greatly
carbed
and
lively
on
the
tounge
kinda
bitey
not
killer
though
gotta
knock
some
points
on
drinkability
as
i
cant
gulp
this
like
a
lighter
pilsner
its
not
a
knock
on
the
beer
it
tastes
good
but
not
as
easy
going
as
most
in
style
a
case
purchase
would
be
ideal
if
it
came
in
12ozers
i
like
dfh
better
when
the
beer
is
under
10
beyond
that
things
get
fishy
i
suppose
what
makes
the
mouthfeel
so
unique
is
that
it
isnt
particularly
creamy
like
most
imperial
pilsners
ive
sampled
its
easy
and
dangerous
to
gulp
down
savor
this
one
or
it
may
bite
back
d
as
i
enjoyed
my
glass
this
beer
got
better
and
better
maybe
its
was
some
warming
maybe
its
was
me
finding
this
beer
maybe
i
got
a
bit
of
a
buzz
on
maybe
all
three
is
it
a
great
pilsner
not
really
but
in
the
imperial
way
its
very
good
while
it
loses
some
of
the
subtle
complexities
of
a
pilsner
it
does
make
up
for
it
in
other
ways
cool
stuff
real
glad
i
tried
it
d
delicious
offering
from
dfh
one
of
those
types
you
wish
would
be
available
more
often
update
not
as
good
in
the
bottle
but
if
you
find
it
fresh
on
tap
go
for
it
d
very
wish
it
could
be
a
year
round
beer
for
dogfish
head
would
be
a
everyday
beer
for
me
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
drinkability
is
decent
the
hops
were
really
blended
nicely
to
give
it
a
nice
range
of
flavors
the
noble
hops
arent
my
favorite
hoppy
flavors
though
so
it
was
a
little
less
drinkable
for
me
personally
overall
though
it
was
a
really
cool
beer
with
a
nice
range
of
flavors
to
it
d
over
all
a
great
larger
has
great
after
taste
that
fills
my
mouth
with
fruity
under
tones
dthe
taste
stays
well
in
fact
it
starts
to
taste
better
and
better
i
genuinely
enjoyed
all
of
this
one
even
though
it
doesnt
blow
me
away
this
was
my
second
bottle
and
i
plan
to
have
more
some
day
honestly
i
expected
a
little
more
from
this
brew
its
wellcrafted
but
a
little
conservative
compared
to
the
rest
of
the
dogfish
head
lineup
its
still
worthy
of
a
try
my
antonia
is
one
of
the
breweries
occasional
rarities
so
you
should
definitely
pick
it
up
if
you
come
across
it
because
you
may
not
have
another

for
a

it

the

might
not
be

off

it

the

off
i
dont

much

is

a
good

take

the
flavor

is
subdued

right
on
style
the
lighter
malt
flavor
does
a
good
job
of
presenting
the
european
hops
which
are
somewhat
mellower
than
west
coast
style
hopping
the
hop
and
malt
flavors
are
well
balanced
and
taste
good
the
alcohol
is
amazingly
well
covered

guess
this

half
the

does
not
push

well
made
a
pleasure
to
drink
better
than
expected
from

i
was
expecting
a
darker
beer
but
it
was
definetly
interesting
it
came

was
there

nothing

aroma
is

full
of
sorachi

citrus
rind
mostly
lemon
pineapple
bubblegum
dill
and
fruity
yeast
esters
along
with
a
moderate
dose
of
butterscotchlike
diacetyl
these
fruity
and
herbal
characters
translate
well
on
the
palate
quite
sweet
but
with
a
strong
underlying
woody
and
herbal
character
as
well
i
am
tempted
to
compare
this
to
a
belgian
brew
with
regards
to
yeast
there
is
ample
pineapple
clove
and
coriander
spice
citrus
strawberry
and
a
little
raspberry
and
dried
applepear
flavor
with
the
sorachi
hops
presumably
adding
some
subtle
perfumed
lychee
fruit
that
i
did
not
get
on
the
nose
malts
are
subdued
in
favor
of
the
yeast
and
hops
moderate
to
thick
body
quite
highly
carbonated
smooth
and
drinkable
but
with
a
woody
bite
in
the
semidry
finish
one
simply
cannot
escape
the
belgian
yeast
character
which
manages
to
overshadow
the
malts
and
distinctive
sorachi
hops
although
the
latter
do
add
their
own
unique
flourishes
is
this
really
made
with
lager
yeast
if
not
how
is
this
beer
an
imperial
pilsener
in
any
event
another
offering
from
this
brewery
that
offers
some
unique
flavors
and
that
defies
any
real
attempts
at
categorization
o
other
than
marketing
i
dont
understand
why
you
would
feature
an
indigenous
malt
and
hide
its
potential
unique
nuances
with
such
distinct
yeast
characteristics
and
sorachi
ace
hops
on
top
of
that
this
ends
up
tasting
like
the
lot
of
their
lightcolored
beers
not
that
thats
a
bad
thing
drinking
yet
another
one
of
these
just
convinces
me
that
i
have
to
trade
for
fresher
west
coast
bottles
or
visit
this
place
overall
this
is
a
very
intersting
beer
the
woodvanilla
notes
are
unique
and
i
love
sorachi
ace
hops
a
different
but
well
put
together
beer
an
odd
take
on
a
pilsner
not
clean
and
crisp
but
a
more
complicated
flavor
probably
from
the
sorachi
ace
hops
to
me
this
has
more
characteristics
of
a
hefeweizenweissbier
than
a
pilsner
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
what
i
was
expecting
from
a
pilsner
o
a
good
pilsner
imperial
overall
i
enjoyed
the
creaminess
of
it
while
still
being
crisp
easy
to
drink
beautiful
golden
orange
amber
color
not
much
of
a
head
has
a
nice
fresh
citrusy
smell
tastes
pretty
good
combination
of
malty
sweet
with
some
tiny
bit
of
bitterness
very
balanced
between
the
citrus
and
the
hop
not
a
heavy
beer
but
refreshing
nice
beer
poured
a
cloudy
golden
body
with
a
thin
ring
of
foam
no
real
head
to
speak
of
that
reced
to
nothing
leaving
no
lacing
not
the
best
appearance
but
decent
enough
scents
of
lemon
sweet
spices
especially
nutmeg
and
some
slight
cinnamon
pear
pale
malt
yeasty
bread
some
floral
aromas
and
some
grassy
and
haylike
aromas
very
complex
for
a
pilsner
even
an
imperial
pilsner
with
a
lot
going
on
some
of
it
very
belgianlike
other
aromas
very
much
true
to
pilsner
form
the
hops
and
yeast
they
use
in
this
give
it
a
very
pleasant
complex
aroma
flavor
begins
with
bitter
lemon
and
other
citrus
rind
that
are
sustained
throughout
moves
into
some
floral
hops
spicy
yeast
flavors
some
sweet
pale
malt
and
some
hints
of
oak
and
vanilla
in
the
middle
of
the
sip
finish
is
quite
dry
and
spicy
with
a
zesty
bitter
and
spicy
aftertaste
its
a
good
flavor
very
refreshing
bold
citrusy
and
spicy
very
different
from
other
imperial
pilsners
with
a
lot
of
belgian
style
spice
and
some
unique
citrus
and
flora
hop
flavors
very
well
done
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
somewhat
drying
mouthfeel
quite
good
the
drying
feeling
makes
you
want
to
sip
more
and
the
body
and
carbonation
encourage
sipping
overall
this
is
a
very
good
imperial
pilsner
its
unique
using
a
distinctly
japanese
hop
variety
to
add
some
nice
spicy
citrusy
flavors
that
balance
the
sweet
pale
malt
its
aroma
is
also
distinct
and
quite
spicy
like
a
belgian
giving
it
complexity
you
dont
usually
suspect
from
any
form
of
pilsner
very
good
highly
recommended
lighter
bodied
wih
a
bit
more
of
a
crisp
spicy
hop
bite
than
the
aroma
suggests
still
subtle
with
earthy
grass
and
bitter
dry
pine
needle
theres
a
decent
amount
of
dryness
followed
by
a
pilsner
malt
backbone
with
a
touch
of
light
fruit
sweetness
some
breadyeast
in
there
as
well
along
with
biscuit
and
a
subtle
crackery
malt
character
overall
impression
a
nice
example
of
an
american
imperial
pilsner
with
some
interesting
hop
character
from
japan
the
sorachi
ace
hop
with
its
lemony
zesty
and
floral
characteristics
evoke
summer
afternoons
and
a
nice
cold
glass
of
lemonade
the
biscuity
malt
brings
it
back
down
to
earth
and
away
from
a
completely
lemonade
like
taste
i
enjoyed
this
beer
a
lot
this
is
a
decent
brew
but
i
am
not
sure
i
am
also
drinking
this
at
its
prime
either
id
have
this
again
sometime
o
this
is
a
very
interesting
beer
with
an
interesting
story
behind
it
how
the
owner
brought
back
the
historical
barley
from
16
seeds
enjoyable
but
more
of
a
sipping
beer
than
an
easy
drinker
i
think
this
is
probably
more
of
a
belgian
pale
or
strong
pale
ale
rather
than
a
american
doubleimperial
pilsner
but
i
have
nothing
definitive
to
have
the
style
changed
o
this
is
a
very
interesting
and
enjoyable
beer
that
has
unique
flavors
from
the
malts
and
hops
o
you
will
pay
a
pretty
penny
to
enjoy
a
hitachino
nest
brew
especially
in
america
but
you
have
to
try
all
of
these
award
winning
brews
at
least
once
in
your
life
time
this
beer
is
very
easy
and
light
to
drink
it
reminds
me
of
a
belgian
dubbel
because
of
the
yeast
tangy
taste
that
you
get
after
the
spice
bites
and
light
carbonation
i
can
tell
the
brewer
paid
close
attention
to
detail
in
designing
and
brewing
this
beer
because
though
it
is
a
belgian
style
he
made
it
his
own
with
a
good
balance
in
all
the
characteristics
of
the
beer
from
appearance
to
even
the
feel
of
it
in
your
mouth
i
am
satisfied
with
my
purchase
and
would
drink
this
again
medium
golden
coloured
with
long
lasting
head
sorashi
can
be
a
powerful
hop
less
diluted
this
one
tastes
rather
orange
than
lemony
kind
of
like
a
pomelo
is
to
a
grapefruit
neutral
aroma
decent
drinkability
and
complex
though
whats
actually
in
here
is
a
secret

great
beer
o
ive
been
wanting
to
try
this
for
a
while
and
it
is
quite
good
just
wish
it
wasnt
so
pricey
nevertheless
these
guys
know
what
theyre
doing
overall
not
the
intense
flavor
i
was
hoping
for
but
a
smooth
and
delicious
beer
would
get
it
again
if
the
price
was
less
had
much
higher
hopes
for
this
especially
given
the
cost
poured
at
a
good
temperature
fairly
aggressive
with
a
small
to
medium
size
head
that
soon
settled
and
some
lace
color
is
a
clear
amber
with
lots
of
bubble
trails
aroma
is
nice
malt
yeast
hop
funk
ginger
bread
dough
flavors
similar
to
nose
but
not
quite
as
an
appealing
mix
that
is
fairly
dry
astringent
hop
and
yeast
bitter
some
malt
carbonic
tang
body
is
there
but
not
very
balanced
and
harsh
with
carbonation
at
the
verge
of
being
ambivelant
finish
is
like
flavor
astringency
lasting
a
long
time
not
a
fav
this
is
really
well
made
and
blows
brooklyn
sorachi
ace
out
of
the
water
which
is
the
only
thing
i
can
compare
it
to
something
i
would
highly
recommend
another
lovely
beer
from
my
favorite
brewery
really
very
lovely
bottle
sweet
looking
bottle
pours
a
glowing
sunburnt
orange
with
a
tall
airy
frothy
white
sticky
head
nice
fresh
dry
hop
aroma
sorachi
ace
all
the
way
and
it
seems
fairly
noble
like
light
biscuit
sweetness
lovely
dry
maybe
light
cedar
flavor
follows
very
dry
all
sorachi
ace
medium
bitterness
dry
dry
little
alcohol
shows
in
the
finish
because
of
this
i
think
light
fruit
and
lemon
lemon
cookie
touch
of
white
pepper
light
bodied
with
larger
slightly
sharp
carbonation
lightly
milky
very
good
beer
o
i
really
dont
know
how
to
categorize
this
beer
as
mentioned
in
the
taste
category
it
has
some
strong
lemon
attributes
reminds
me
of
sunshine
especially
since
it
is
the
dead
of
winter
here
unusual
description
i
know
but
its
hard
to
put
words
to
it
nice
unique
brew
really
nice
brew
and
interestingly
drinkable
for
a
specialrelease
beer
indeed
id
be
perfectly
happy
to
drink
this
regularly
as
a
pleasant
afterwork
beer
tastes
like
bass
or
becks
reminitions
of
a
highly
carbonated
belgian
with
a
metallic
scent
and
taste
good
to
experience
and
add
to
a
collection
considering
its
scarcity
but
not
worth
the
price
the
foodery
in
philadelphia
pa
carried
this
collectors
should
buy
it
and
enthusiests
should
enjoy
other
nest
beer
pours
a
fairly
clear
dark
gold
with
a
white
head
that
holds
quite
well
and
leaves
tons
of
lace
nose
brings
a
lot
at
once
but
all
things
olfactory
seem
to
be
harmonizing
here
like
they
were
meant
to
be
grains
are
definitely
one
of
the
highlights
kind
of
a
speltbuckwheat
thing
going
on
on
top
of
some
woodsy
flower
notes
and
a
honeyed
hop
character
taste
isnt
nearly
as
grainy
to
me
and
the
floral
seems
to
come
out
much
more
soft
elegant
delicate
taste
on
a
soft
medium
body
barely
any
alcohol
detected
and
minimal
bitterness
first
new
beer
ive
seen
from
hitachino
nest
in
a
long
time
and
theyve
really
showcased
their
world
wonderfully
this
beer
pours
a
nice
golden
yellow
color
it
has
a
finger
of
white
head
resting
on
top
the
head
has
good
retention
and
it
leaves
a
lot
of
sticky
lace
behind
on
the
glass
the
nose
starts
off
with
some
sweet
bready
maltiness
and
a
big
earthiness
there
is
a
nice
bit
of
lemon
zest
here
as
well
as
a
bit
of
a
medicinal
quality
to
it
the
taste
follows
the
now
pretty
well
it
starts
off
with
some
bready
malt
sweetness
and
some
earthiness
there
is
a
nice
mild
hop
presence
as
well
as
some
citrus
and
lemon
zest
it
has
somewhat
of
a
medicinal
honey
cough
drop
taste
coming
through
the
finish
is
dry
and
it
leaves
some
lingering
earthy
citrus
flavor
on
the
palate
this
has
a
medium
body
and
medium
to
high
carbonation
it
goes
down
easy
and
there
is
a
nice
smooth
quality
to
it
there
is
some
earthy
hop
bitterness
and
some
sweetness
there
is
some
dryness
on
the
back
end
as
well
this
has
pretty
good
drinkability
it
would
really
benefit
a
lot
if
it
didnt
have
that
cough
drop
quality
to
it
other
than
that
it
is
a
really
nice
beer
but
it
still
isnt
as
good
of
an
example
of
the
style
as
it
could
have
been
i
would
drink
this
beer
again
but
i
dont
think
i
would
buy
it
the
hop
usage
is
quite
nice
in
a
bpa
refreshing
and
balanced
ok
i
need
to
get
out
more
saw
this
on
the
50
taps
board
at
frisco
grille
in
columbia
md
and
had
to
try
it
id
seen
the
bottles
in
the
stores
and
knew
they
were
expensive
so
thought
id
be
able
to
try
it
out
most
expensive
beer
i
ever
bought
served
in
a
very
heavy
10
oz
goblet
color
was
deep
yellow
with
an
amber
center
and
a
nice
12
inch
head
very
light
subtle
carbonation
visible
i
remember
thinking
flowerslike
sakurain
the
nose
probably
because
i
knew
it
was
japanese
and
predisposed
to
smell
cherry
blossoms
but
i
also
remember
thinking
it
was
quite
unusual
in
its
hints
of
floral
in
the
initial
taste
and
a
subtle
and
welcome
sweetnesslike
sweet
rice
breadin
the
body
many
different
all
pleasant
flavors
that
ended
in
an
eversosubtle
hint
of
bitterness
coupled
with
the
richer
and
somewhat
smooth
and
creamy
mouthfeel
i
enjoyed
it
immensely
and
for
10
a
glass
its
a
good
thing
of
course
i
didnt
know
how
much
it
was
at
the
time
but
no
regrets
o
really
liked
this
beer
though
it
is
a
bit
steep
for
the
price
that
being
said
id
buy
it
again
to
support
japans
pushing
of
boundaries
this
pours
out
as
a
really
clear
looking
yellowish
golden
ipod
with
a
fizzy
white
head
on
top
the
head
has
a
very
light
amount
retention
but
it
also
has
a
light
lacing
too
the
smell
of
the
bet
is
a
little
grainy
and
fresh
smelling
the
taste
has
some
element
s
of
grains
light
spices
and
rice
the
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
is
light
and
easy
going
overall
its
better
than
i
remember
it
being
the
first
time
i
had
it
from
a
bottle
worth
a
try
i
think
its
very
hard
to
judge
a
beer
on
the
qualities
above
because
it
doesnt
look
particularly
good
but
its
a
very
good
tasting
brew
its
my
first
hitachino
and
so
far
i
really
like
the
individuality
it
has
o
a
very
pleasant
drop
without
being
powerful
its
balance
is
outstanding
and
leaves
you
wanting
more
nipponia
is
a
very
characterful
belgianstyle
ale
that
because
of
the
hops
remind
me
of
brooklyns
sorachi
ace
the
lemon
pepper
and
lemongrass
flavors
are
unmistakable
the
lemony
japanese
influence
fits
like
a
glove
as
do
the
peppery
notes
sweet
and
bitter
earthy
wood
notes
and
overall
sakelike
lightness
this
beer
begs
to
be
paired
with
many
sushi
dishes
i
thought
this
was
one
tasty
beer
and
that
should
be
enough
reason
to
drink
it
again
but
at
10
a
550ml
i
doubt
ill
be
drinking
a
whole
lot
of
it
in
the
future
with
so
many
great
beers
ive
never
tried
here
in
alberta
i
now
want
too
explore
the
sorachi
ace
but
can
only
thing
of
brooklyn
examples
in
alberta
please
correct
me
if
im
wrong
overall
a
phenominal
beer
with
crazy
unique
characteristics
bravo
o
a
solid
brew
front
to
back
definitely
represents
both
aspects
of
a
strong
belgian
with
an
english
pale
ale
well
worth
a
purchase
o
a
tasty
beer
showcased
the
sorachi
ace
hop
quite
well
pours
with
a
onefinger
white
head
that
vanishes
quickly
leaving
traces
of
lace
hazy
light
amber
color
good
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
malty
nose
and
flavor
is
malty
hints
of
honey
slight
bitterness
at
finish
12
95
for
a
550ml
bottle
from
colonial
spirits
acton
ma
o
a
tasty
take
on
the
style
and
definitely
worth
picking
up
easy
drinking
flavours
and
very
refreshing
for
a
sunny
afternoon
o
the
most
outstanding
parts
of
this
beer
was
its
mysterious
slight
unusual
flavors
and
the
incredible
light
sessionability
almost
like
a
lagerreplacer
this
is
the
sort
of
thing
you
can
drink
and
savor
or
beer
pong
with
if
thats
your
thing
dont
freak
out
if
you
havent
had
this
and
cant
find
it
but
if
you
do
find
it
id
definitely
say
pick
it
up
good
stuff
interesting
an
interesting
and
unique
beer
check
it
out
if
you
get
the
chance
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
hitachinos
beers
in
general
but
this
is
one
of
their
good
ones
this
is
a
good
beer
and
i
will
get
it
again
and
again
d
like
all
of
hitachinos
spicy
beers
its
an
acquired
taste
nose
is
lemony
and
zesty
hints
of
belgian
esters
a
little
bit
of
tropical
sweetness
more
lemon
in
the
flavor
along
with
a
reall
earthy
character
bit
of
spicy
peppercorn
quality
perhaps
a
touch
of
loamy
wood
light
honey
bread
sweetness
clean
and
refreshing
while
still
nuanced
and
interesting
would
gladly
drink
again
o
very
decent
japanese
craft
beer
but
somehow
still
reminds
me
of
asahi
super
dry
a
whole
lot
of
unfamiliar
but
ultimately
enjoyable
stuff
going
on
in
this
brew
trying
the
brooklyn
sorachi
ace
a
while
back
prepared
me
somewhat
but
wow
what
a
difference
terroir
makes
calling
this
a
belgian
pale
ale
seems
like
trying
to
force
a
square
peg
into
a
round
hole
there
are
apparent
similarities
sure
but
after
a
while
you
just
want
to
create
a
whole
new
definition
thus
no
points
debit
here
for
not
adhering
to
style
overall
a
disappointment
i
know
some
folks
who
love
a
good
cough
drop
me
i
cant
standm
so
a
beer
that
reminds
me
of
one
from
the
initial
sip
isnt
particularly
a
good
one
happy
i
was
able
to
taste
this
obscure
rarity
pours
a
cloudy
brown
sunset
orange
with
a
fleeting
half
inch
of
head
nose
is
sweeter
bready
malts
bright
citrus
especially
tangerine
taste
is
more
of
the
same
with
maybe
a
touch
of
light
caramel
and
mandarin
showing
up
along
with
some
vinous
notes
tasty
beer
but
far
from
though
provoking
for
the
price
would
love
to
get
my
hands
on
a
fresh
as
possible
bottle
of
this
brew
love
sorachi
hops
and
this
does
not
disappoint
nothing
really
offensive
about
it
yet
not
a
very
strong
rendition
of
the
style
no
real
character
or
depth
of
flavour
to
speak
of
perhaps
an
unintimidating
stepping
stone
for
those
just
getting
into
belgians
but
it
still
doesnt
do
the
actual
style
any
justice
this
is
a
pleasant
pale
ale
with
complex
flavoring
definitely
worth
a
try
hard
to
find
though
notes
interesting
beer
with
the
sorachi
hops
giving
a
good
amount
of
the
flavors
which
is
good
since
this
is
why
i
got
this
lemony
with
a
slight
funk
slightly
resembles
a
saison
although
not
entirely
like
one
good
and
interesting
worth
a
try
d
not
quite
classically
a
bpa
but
definitely
drinkable
it
starts
off
with
an
acidic
sourness
and
then
blooms
with
floral
hops
into
a
very
nice
balance
of
flavor
this
is
a
great
beer
the
carbonation
was
very
high
initially
another
good
one
from
kiuchi
hitachino
price
10
50
at
witherspoon
wines
not
knowing
what
to
expect
i
was
surprised
with
this
beer
unfortunately
at
least
for
my
review
the
nose
really
kills
the
overall
score
of
the
beers
ive
had
from
the
asia
region
this
one
ranks
at
the
top
of
my
list
definitely
worth
trying
if
you
have
an
opportunity
id
definitely
pick
up
a
few
more
bottles
of
this
in
the
future
if
i
find
it
again
d
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
hitachino
seems
to
do
quite
well
interpreting
old
world
beer
styles
and
this
one
is
no
exception
the
soriachi
ace
is
a
very
nice
hop
for
this
style
with
a
musty
pithy
character
that
compliments
the
yeast
but
some
citrus
zing
to
help
it
stand
out
from
other
examples
of
the
style
i
have
never
had
a
beer
brewed
with
this
variety
of
malt
before
but
it
seems
to
provide
a
bready
richness
that
acts
as
an
effective
background
for
the
hops
to
play
out
their
role
well
worth
drinking
i
would
love
to
try
this
beer
on
draught
nipponia
a
latinization
of
nippon
which
means
japan
is
a
tasty
little
japanese
pale
ale
that
features
one
of
that
countrys
contributions
to
hops
a
price
tag
of
9
99
is
waaay
too
steep
for
a
second
goround
but
this
certainly
was
an
enjoyable
550
ml
this
could
really
be
made
in
any
country
while
i
like
the
idea
of
an
all
japanese
beer
it
lacks
any
distinct
character
for
me
malty
and
lightly
citrusy
sweet
orange
juice
and
hay
grassy
weedy
wildflower
hop
character
lingering
traces
of
orange
juice
and
even
hints
of
grape
juice
or
pomegranate
oddly
enough
malty
backbone
with
a
complexity
from
the
yeast
medium
bodied
and
pleasant
to
drink
though
this
seems
somewhat
faded
by
time
its
interesting
the
sorachi
ace
hops
lend
a
nice
citrus
note
but
i
cant
help
but
think
it
was
better
a
few
months
ago
all
around
a
solid
easily
drinkable
beer
comes
across
as
an
ipa
or
american
pale
brewed
with
alternative
hops
and
malt
good
subtlebutnotboring
beer
could
probably
stand
up
to
a
wide
variety
of
foods
lemon
pepper
fish
chicken
seem
too
obvious
worth
a
try
definitely
a
different
type
of
beer
but
well
made
as
expected
from
the
folks
at
hitachino
pours
a
typical
straw
yellow
not
inspiring
but
at
least
the
white
head
is
thick
frothy
and
persistent
aroma
is
mainly
yeasty
with
a
fruity
overtone
and
a
malty
undertone
as
well
as
some
sweetness
flavor
is
malty
and
fruity
with
a
surprising
hoppy
tone
and
hints
of
both
apple
and
grapefruit
as
well
as
sweet
sour
and
bitter
touches
texture
is
smooth
and
a
little
thick
just
subtly
tingly
give
it
a
try
this
beer
comes
in
a
550ml
bottle
brew
pours
a
light
golden
honey
hue
with
average
carbonation
that
leaves
behind
a
fast
vanishing
two
finger
head
and
some
little
lacingthe
smell
is
barnyard
funkherbal
hops
and
barleyit
has
a
pretty
average
light
mouthfeel
which
leaves
you
with
tastes
of
orange
zestbarleyyeasty
bread
and
finishes
with
a
nicedry
herbal
hop
hit
of
bitterness
which
leaves
you
thirsty
and
wanting
another
sip
to
whet
the
paletteoverall
i
was
really
excited
to
try
this
brew
as
i
do
like
this
japanese
brewery
alot
but
this
is
not
one
of
their
more
memorable
brews
and
for
the
price
would
rather
revisit
some
of
their
other
ones
that
where
cheaper
and
i
really
did
appreciate
way
more
not
a
great
bpa
however
d
pretty
well
done
i
hope
this
and
brooklyn
represent
the
beginning
of
more
beers
utilizing
the
sorachi
ace
hop
the
beer
pours
very
hazy
color
is
trapped
between
lemon
and
gold
a
nice
two
finger
creamy
white
cap
rises
but
it
quickly
disappears
and
lacing
is
practically
nonexistent
the
nose
is
intriguing
some
belgian
pale
malt
fruity
sweetness
along
with
citrus
and
a
hint
of
funk
after
that
nice
setup
nipponias
flavor
is
a
bit
of
a
letdown
the
sweetness
has
lost
its
fruity
character
theres
no
funk
but
a
bit
of
yeast
spiciness
and
the
lemon
is
still
present
theres
also
an
unwelcome
somewhat
rough
hop
bitterness
that
comes
crashing
through
after
the
malts
while
the
nose
was
of
a
possibly
interesting
belgian
pale
each
sip
tastes
like
an
underattenuated
and
overhopped
saison
the
beer
is
surprisingly
light
this
is
a
good
thing
for
the
amount
of
perceived
sweetness
but
carbonation
is
a
bit
much
although
how
over
the
top
it
is
is
hard
to
tell
nipponia
doesnt
fit
neatly
into
a
style
im
a
fan
of
the
sorachi
ace
hop
love
me
some
brooklyn
sorachi
ace
and
its
used
to
good
effect
here
but
unfortunately
the
beer
surrounding
it
is
a
little
poorly
executed
very
nice
beer
impressive
ive
only
had
a
few
ipl
offerings
and
this
one
is
really
more
of
an
ipa
no
lager
finish
and
way
heavy
on
the
alcohol
imo
i
did
not
see
any
settling
but
i
still
poured
sort
of
gently
getting
a
finger
of
tawny
head
with
good
retention
in
the
process
color
was
a
deepgold
srm
5
7
with
nequality
clarity
the
unholy
trio
of
midas
mammon
and
croesus
did
not
suddenly
show
up
instead
they
were
already
here
just
based
on
the
beers
name
they
are
such
punks
nose
had
a
scent
of
tropical
fruits
especially
coconut
and
papaya
mouthfeel
was
thintomedium
the
taste
was
nothing
like
the
nose
sadly
it
was
much
more
bitter
more
towards
citrus
rind
and
some
grass
not
bad
but
not
what
i
was
expecting
finish
was
dry
with
some
fusel
alcohol
heat
o
a
great
tasting
ipl
easy
to
drink
with
a
huge
helping
of
hop
bitterness
overall
a
rather
tasty
and
quite
easy
drinking
brew
a
rather
nicely
moderately
hopped
brew
that
maintains
a
still
crisp
lager
taste
a
very
nice
drinker
final
thoughts
definitely
not
the
beer
i
was
expecting
given
the
description
on
the
bottle
i
hope
more
breweries
try
out
the
ipl
style
though
just
to
see
if
it
can
be
refined
would
i
drink
it
again
meh
taste
palate
the
taste
is
the
same
with
a
smooth
feel
and
mild
bitterness
in
the
finish
something
just
isnt
quite
working
for
me
here
between
the
bready
malts
bubblegum
and
grapefruit
bitterness
it
just
isnt
adding
up
to
me
beer
is
medium
to
mediumheavy
in
body
with
medium
carbonation
intensity
resulting
in
a
beer
that
has
a
mouthfeel
that
is
gently
foamy
and
smooth
closes
quite
dry
with
light
stickiness
on
the
lips
and
palate
interesting
but
not
really
one
of
my
faves
out
of
the
hybrid
world
of
ipls
and
imperial
pils
id
rather
just
have
the
base
dortmunder
gold
sometimes
less
is
more
its
a
decent
beer
and
perhaps
im
being
a
little
hard
on
it
because
i
expect
great
things
from
great
lakes
but
there
are
too
many
other
rising
ipls
out
their
now
to
ever
really
justify
picking
this
one
up
again
especially
with
the
price
vapid
lager
qualities
and
not
too
standoutish
in
the
hop
bill
either
its
okay
it
really
is
but
i
expect
more
from
these
guys
o
interesting
take
on
a
lager
glad
i
had
a
chance
to
try
this
and
wouldnt
mind
drinking
again
overall
this
beer
in
my
opinion
is
very
complex
and
keeps
me
going
back
for
another
sip
to
figure
out
what
has
me
stumped
this
is
a
very
well
crafted
beer
o
if
it
werent
so
bitter
it
might
be
among
the
better
lagers
ive
ever
had
as
it
stands
its
still
a
good
hoppy
lager
but
bring
your
bitter
tooth
i
great
beer
but
not
sure
its
hoppy
enough
or
malty
enough
but
it
is
a
combination
of
the
two
styles
to
some
extent
and
thats
by
design
anyway
its
a
unique
celebration
beer
and
i
give
it
good
praise
yes
i
am
quite
biased
in
favor
of
great
lakes
brewing
company
because
one
of
my
best
friends
worked
there
for
nine
years
and
ive
spent
many
a
fine
afternoonevening
at
the
place
but
my
preference
for
glbc
beer
is
primarily
because
the
beers
are
almost
always
outstanding
cheers
deep
golden
brilliant
pour
with
1
5
inch
creamy
offwhite
head
the
initial
nose
suggests
citrus
malt
and
biscuits
rich
palate
with
mediumfull
body
and
extended
hop
and
malt
notes
floral
hops
and
a
slight
hint
of
soapiness
modest
carbonation
the
head
has
settled
to
18
inch
leaving
beautiful
belgian
lace
well
balanced
malt
and
hops
on
the
palate
some
spiciness
the
abv
is
not
noticeable
fresh
overall
in
interesting
beer
that
has
a
little
something
for
everyone
taste
wise
reminds
me
a
bit
of
a
fall
seasonaloktoberfest
type
brew
probably
wouldnt
pick
this
up
again
but
was
worth
trying
once
this
is
dortmunder
golds
bigger
brother
i
guess
i
certainly
has
the
same
flavor
profile
well
worth
trying
but
i
prefer
my
lagers
a
little
less
sweet
for
their
25th
anniversary
i
expected
something
more
unique
pours
a
clear
orangehued
gold
with
two
inches
of
frothy
offwhite
head
that
settles
unevenly
and
leaves
a
ton
of
lace
streaks
and
spots
aroma
of
sweet
and
biscuity
malts
grassy
and
floral
hops
citrus
peel
and
a
bit
of
a
spicy
kick
surprisingly
clean
flavor
of
sweet
malts
tangerine
floral
notes
grass
and
resin
lightmediumbodied
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
juicy
then
dry
mouthfeel
some
bitterness
late
this
is
a
great
summer
choice
for
people
like
me
who
are
not
generally
big
fans
of
pilsners
and
other
lighter
lagers
overall
ive
never
sought
after
pilseners
before
but
ive
really
been
enjoying
this
one
there
is
a
nice
complexity
here
a
balance
where
all
of
the
flavors
play
their
part
in
this
coordinated
symphony
no
one
stands
out
from
the
other
a
very
flavorful
and
nearly
refreshing
beer
and
one
that
may
leave
you
contemplative
after
each
sip
i
highly
recommend
this
one
mouthfeel
is
very
nice
medium
body
and
moderately
carbonated
a
little
resinous
for
my
taste
this
is
certainly
worth
trying
but
they
should
do
some
more
experimenting
with
this
style
overall
great
lakes
is
a
company
that
seems
to
always
deliver
while
im
usually
not
into
the
hoppier
beers
i
appreciate
the
complexity
of
this
one
and
how
even
with
the
bitterness
of
the
hops
i
can
walk
away
feeling
that
everything
is
balanced
and
i
want
more
othe
balance
of
the
hops
and
the
imperial
pils
did
not
go
together
not
one
of
my
favorites
from
great
lakes
this
beer
poured
a
clear
copper
with
frothy
white
head
that
is
lacing
quite
nicely
the
scent
is
faint
but
there
is
bittering
hops
and
maybe
a
tinge
of
english
malt
the
taste
is
mostly
dominated
by
alcohol
and
it
is
very
bitter
all
the
way
through
the
beer
not
much
malt
balance
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
in
body
with
decent
carbonation
and
very
dry
overall
not
a
fan
of
this
one
glad
i
split
a
four
pack
with
my
neighbor
as
it
was
a
bit
pricey
overall
great
balance
that
is
hard
to
find
in
this
style
it
truly
is
a
hoppy
beer
and
a
lager
at
the
same
time
great
celebration
of
25
years
o
this
is
a
very
well
done
ipl
my
first
in
fact
it
is
really
bursting
with
many
layers
of
flavor
i
like
the
choice
for
a
25th
anv
beer
from
glb
overall
a
pretty
good
twist
on
a
lager
good
biscuity
rye
spiced
malts
with
a
big
helping
of
hops
o
a
solid
beer
but
doesnt
really
raise
the
style
to
the
next
level
o
like
the
few
other
ipls
out
there
this
was
very
well
done
i
commend
gl
for
their
work
and
for
helping
define
a
new
category
of
beer
with
the
few
others
out
there
doing
ipls
i
would
recommend
ipa
lovers
try
this
one
for
sure
overall
really
nice
beer
a
nice
mix
of
a
ipa
and
lager
with
one
of
the
best
balances
you
could
ask
for
its
not
the
smoothest
beer
out
there
so
the
drinkability
is
hinder
after
a
couple
bottles
but
none
the
less
is
enjoyable
and
worth
a
drink
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
well
i
dont
know
all
of
my
scores
off
the
top
of
my
head
but
this
is
probably
my
second
least
favorite
glb
beer
just
behind
or
ahead
lake
erie
monster
its
far
from
a
bad
beer
but
im
not
sure
what
to
make
of
it
it
smells
like
an
ipa
and
a
pilsner
and
dortmunder
gold
but
it
tastes
of
dough
and
alcohol
im
strangely
compelled
by
this
one
pretty
solid
and
worth
trying
but
i
wont
exactly
miss
it
once
its
gone
o
i
was
looking
forward
to
this
offering
and
though
the
entire
time
i
was
saying
just
give
us
the
imperial
dortmunder
and
ill
be
happy
i
am
glad
they
released
this
ipl
as
it
was
extremely
well
crafted
and
really
the
staple
of
what
the
brewery
is
about
they
make
some
excellent
ales
but
also
some
of
the
best
lagers
it
was
appropriate
to
do
silver
and
gold
and
its
something
to
get
ahold
of
now
very
creative
brew
and
one
ill
always
remember
as
glbcs
way
of
celebrating
25
years
of
fine
brewing
not
only
was
this
a
tribute
to
their
past
but
like
the
bottle
says
a
nod
to
the
future
glasses
up
to
glbg
again
and
a
congrats
on
25
years
overall
this
is
a
great
example
of
a
new
american
style
known
as
an
india
pale
lager
very
few
examples
of
the
style
if
any
have
ever
been
drank
there
mouthfeel
is
very
nice
not
to
heavy
with
a
great
mouthfeel
do
this
anniversary
lager
is
of
the
typical
high
quality
of
great
lakes
full
of
great
intentions
and
careful
consideration
of
different
aspects
of
balance
if
there
is
a
continuum
of
qualities
with
commodore
perry
at
one
end
and
rye
of
the
tiger
at
the
other
this
ipl
would
comfortably
be
placed
near
the
midway
point
between
them
what
this
beer
bears
little
resemblance
to
is
traditional
pilsnerrather
it
is
another
iteration
of
this
brewerys
approach
to
ipas
that
happened
to
be
brewed
with
lager
yeast
the
single
greatest
complaint
that
can
be
leveled
upon
it
is
the
strength
of
this
beerexcessive
considering
the
qualities
present
o
leaned
more
towards
their
lager
then
a
pa
it
was
more
spicy
and
malty
than
hoppy
but
it
was
refreshing
and
worth
a
try
vibrant
copper
color
with
quickly
diminishing
white
head
and
nice
lacing
aroma
is
malty
with
a
light
hop
presence
but
pretty
weak
flavor
is
huge
compared
to
the
aroma
its
got
a
powerful
mix
of
bitter
piney
hops
roasty
malts
and
herbal
earthy
notes
mouthfeel
is
light
with
high
carbonation
that
tingles
overall
its
a
very
good
unique
beer
the
beer
is
golden
hued
and
clear
with
a
small
white
head
huge
lager
yeast
aroma
with
grain
sourdough
bread
nice
flavor
though
a
bit
unbalanced
by
the
overabundance
of
lager
yeast
character
hop
character
throughout
with
a
gentle
bitter
finish
overall
this
was
decent
but
i
wouldnt
want
to
drink
a
12
oz
bottle
by
myself
pours
a
slightly
hazy
yellowish
color
with
an
off
white
head
in
the
aroma
orange
citrus
hops
in
the
taste
big
citrus
hops
and
a
touch
of
alcohol
but
a
nice
balance
a
small
bite
of
citrus
hops
and
a
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
nice
earthy
citrus
hop
in
the
aftertaste
i
am
truly
impressed
by
this
beer
i
have
not
really
enjoyed
and
ipl
until
this
one
well
done
not
an
alltime
great
but
very
enjoyable
if
anything
slightly
overcarbonated
as
gl
beers
can
be
from
time
to
time
just
slightly
this
is
a
new
style
du
jour
and
i
love
it
this
is
a
worthy
entrant
into
the
arena
if
the
beer
is
a
hoppy
lager
then
its
a
fine
beer
if
its
a
light
bodied
ipa
then
its
a
fine
beer
theres
nothing
about
the
fusion
found
here
that
suggests
that
it
is
anything
more
or
less
that
simply
a
fine
beer
but
it
is
one
that
makes
me
think
with
every
sip
the
body
is
light
almost
medium
and
deep
theres
a
good
smoothness
to
the
consistent
crisp
bite
as
each
sip
rolls
on
the
tongue
off
a
steady
carbonation
its
clean
overall
and
goes
slightly
dry
into
the
herbal
finish
without
getting
too
chalky
a
hoppy
lager
with
a
little
bit
of
a
booziness
problem
still
a
damn
fine
effort
from
a
standup
brewery
a
bangup
brew
a
fourpack
is
an
optimal
quantity
good
job
great
lakes
this
was
my
first
beer
review
overall
interesting
hybrid
but
this
isnt
really
a
pale
lager
i
would
describe
this
as
an
imperialized
version
of
eliot
ness
with
a
boatload
of
citrusy
hops
which
really
makes
sense
as
an
anniversary
beer
smooth
bright
citrusy
grapefruit
nice
fullbodied
mouthfeel
and
crisp
aftertaste
without
being
syrupy
very
drinkable
one
of
the
better
beers
ive
had
this
year
a
6
of
these
could
go
down
very
enjoyably
which
is
not
something
that
you
can
say
about
all
7
5
beers
o
i
hope
to
see
more
breweries
taking
on
an
ipl
but
this
is
really
lacking
in
the
lager
area
its
very
reminiscent
to
alchemy
hour
but
just
a
little
less
awesome
it
really
needs
toned
down
but
if
you
told
someone
it
was
an
ipa
theyd
believe

guys
it
seems
like
the

i
have
from

were
all
pretty
good
and
this

might
be
the
best
of
them
keep
up

a
very
good

its

the

of
what
a

be

with

toasted

and
a
clean
snappy

add
to
that
a
wellstyled
wellstructured
and
appropriately
bitter
hop
character
and
the
various
parts
of
this
beer
add
up
to
an
exceptional

the
style
personally
i
really

i
was

last

this
was
my
first
imperial
pilsner
and
my
first
from
great
lakes
ive
now
had
the
anniversary
offerings
from
goose
island
new
glarus
and
great
lakes
are
anniversary
beers
just
categorically
bad
overall
another
winner
from
great
lakes
had
no
idea
what
to
expect
from
this
one
going
in
and
i
like
what
i
got
ill
enjoy
the

for
a

beer
i
want
to
get
some
more
of
this
overall
another
solid
beer
from
great
lakes
really
digging
this
style
and
am
excited
to
try
any
breweries
take
dortmunder
gold
is
a
solid
base
to
start
with
and
it
makes
this
beer
solid
give
it
a
try
if
your
into
hops
silver
and
gold
imperial
style
pale
lager
is
a
25th
anniversary
beer
from
great
lakes
pilsners
are
not
my
favorite
style
but
i
do
enjoy
traditional
lagers
with
their
clean
malt
flavors
and
nice
peppery
finish
this
one
is
like
dortmunder
gold
with
a
generous
dryhopping
experimental
possibly
successful
i
think
so
i
could
definitely
see
myself
enjoying
the
earthy
bitterness
of
this
one
just
before
a
meal
overall
definitely
worth
a
try
will
please
light
and
dark
beer
drinkers
alike
o
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
ipl
it
strikes
a
very
nice
balance
between
the
classic
lager
style
and
the
hops
that
finish
it
up
this
might
become
one
of
my
go
to
session
lagers
its
smooth
crisp
refreshing
easy
drinking
but
the
flavor
doesnt
let
you
down
at
all
90
o
my
first
ipl
which
seems
to
be
an
emerging
style
i
really
liked
the
hop
character
on
this
beer
and
it
was
really
refreshing
the
lagering
of
this
beer
seemed
to
give
it
a
lot
more
sweetness
and
crispness
than
other
ipas
really
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
this
is
a
huge
miss
a
shame
that
this
is
the
25th
anniversary
of
a
brewery
i
normally
like
either
great
lakes
is
living
in
a
vacuum
where
lagers
with
american
hops
dont
exist
or
they
tried
to
sell
an
imperial
pilsner
or
imperial
dortmunder
w
the
promise
of
american
hops
whatever
the
approach
was
this
plain
sucks
i
wish
this
had
been
vetted
in
the
pub
i
would
have
happily
passed
along
this
feedback
there
are
so
many
other
beers
that
they
could
have
riffed
on
this
actually
made
me
miss
imperial
dortmunder
which
besides
the
booze
was
a
much
cleaner
and
focused
beer
one
of
the
worst
big
releases
of
the
year
disappointing
through
and
through
o
overall
another
winner
from
glbc
o
its
a
lager
and
it
has
great
hop
flavor
best
part
is
25
years
of
great
lakes
brewing
in
conclusion
as
a
longtime
fan
of
great
lakes
this
is
another
great
anniversary
ale
based
on
their
flagship
brew
the
ipl
presents
the
potential
danger
to
simply
unload
hops
on
a
middleofthe
road
lager
but
the
brewers
crafting
truly
great
lagers
can
bring
new
complexity
in
an
exciting
way
well
done
cheers
silver
gold
ipl
is
surprisingly
good
its
a
really
nice
hoppy
lager
its
honestly
much
better
than
i
anticipated
great
lakes
may
surprise
some
with
this
25th
anniversary
release
but
it
doesnt
surprise
me
at
all
given
that
their
flagship
dortmunder
gold
is
a
lagerthis
is
perfect
i
believe
imperial
dortmunder
was
their
20th
anniversary
release
silver
gold
ipl
is
fitting
for
the
25th
good
stuff
happy
25th
i
really
like
this
beer
its
another
winner
that
great
lakes
can
add
to
their
resume
more
proof
that
great
lakes
knows
their
lagers
this
is
great
example
of
this
emerging
ipl
style
recommended
o
the
ipl
is
a
fairly
new
style
to
me
i
had
my
first
one
about
ten
months
ago
and
have
only
had
a
handful
of
varieties
i
find
it
an
interesting
alternative
to
an
ipa
it
has
a
lot
of
flavor
and
goes
down
quite
easily
i
am
kind
of
a
great
lakes
homer
so
of
course
i
like
this
beer
o
this
tastes
very
nice
seems
like
a
similar
hop
bill
to
burning
river
ill
probably
be
picking
up
another
four
pack
while
its
still
around
great
lakes
try
at
a
hoppy
lager
doesnt
really
do
justice
to
their
25th
anniversary
appearance
is
the
gold
hue
youd
expect
from
a
german
lager
the
aroma
is
unique
plenty
of
hops
but
with
an
almost
sugary
sweetness
the
flavor
is
similar
a
fullbodied
hit
of
complex
hops
followed
by
a
sweet
aftertaste
reminiscent
of
munich
lager
which
oddly
enough
is
among
the
most
subtly
hopped
lagers
out
there
the
mouthfeel
is
rich
but
not
at
all
heavy
making
this
a
complex
but
drinkable
beer
ive
tried
sam
adams
ipl
and
victorys
prima
pils
but
have
never
tasted
anything
that
so
purely
melded
the
flavors
of
an
ipa
over
a
refreshing
lager
base
an
ambitious
experiment
pulled
off
flawlessly
i
think
the
ipl
is
a
bit
of
a
confused
style
one
that
i
like
a
lot
ive
had
many
that
have
a
similar
likeness
to
a
very
clean
apa
or
ones
like
that
that
are
pretty
much
an
imperial
pilsner
either
way
a
whole
lot
of
fun
to
drink
cheers
o
overall
this
is
just
okay
this
isnt
my
favorite
style
at
all
so
i
cant
really
judge
it
too
harshly
the
smell
and
taste
is
good
but
the
look
and
mouthfeel
leave
a
lot
to
be
desired
smells
good
looks
great
tastes
good
body
is
ok
lacks
a
certain
zest
or
quality
of
refreshment
that
i
associate
with
a
great
pilsner
carbonation
did
seem
to
be
just
a
touch
on
the
light
side
which
could
account
for
it
finish
is
ok
good
enough
beer
it
has
the
aroma
of
a
true
pilsener
the
problem
might
be
one
of
imperializing
the
style
as
with
other
examples
ive
had
it
just
becomes
a
sticky
brew
rather
than
a
refreshing
one
still
it
is
what
they
were
going
for
i
suppose
overall
enjoyable
for
one
overall
chads
barleywine
was
solid
johns
dark
lager
wcherries
was
nice
especially
4
99
for
a
bomber
and
johnson
was
a
delicious
fresh
iipa
it
felt
like
lakefront
was
just
starting
to
hit
their
stride
with
the
my
turn
series
well
they
couldnt
make
it
four
straight
pilo
is
a
mess
of
malt
yeast
and
alcohol
i
dont
say
this
often
but
this
is
a
beer
worth
passing
up
maybe
take
a
free
taster
if
you
see
it
on
tap
although
it
might
be
worth
buying
a
pint
to
smell
it
just
dont
take
a
sip
a
strange
imperial
pilsener
its
loaded
with
lavender
or
jasmine
floral
aroma
coming
from
seemingly
nowhere
its
extremely
aromatic
and
almost
perfumelike
in
its
impression
no
additives
in
here
that
im
aware
of
so
maybe
high
fermentation
temperatures
pulled
these
esters
out
of
the
yeast
i
just
dont
know
where
else
that
flowery
thing
could
come
from
i
dont
dislike
it
but
it
seems
odd
for
the
style
the
beer
is
really
sweet
too
so
much
residual
sugar
on
this
its
hard
to
drink
more
than
one
glass
of
which
i
guess
is
common
in
this
big
pils
style
now
but
its
a
contradiction
to
me
and
unpleasant
also
a
lot
of
body
on
it
for
a
summer
release
hard
to
drink
much
of
it
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
though
and
the
bubbles
keep
it
moving
when
i
think
of
pilsener
i
think
refreshment
and
this
one
doesnt
take
me
there
it
is
however
quite
unique
and
an
interesting
example
of
the
style
if
indeed
those
floral
essences
were
intentional
this
is
surprisingly
nice
not
overly
bitter
good
malt
and
a
nice
hoppy
graininess
id
drink
this
again
another
solid
entry
from
the
my
turn
series
i
should
note
that
my
bottle
is
just
over
4
weeks
old
at
this
point
summer
is
great
for
lagers
and
this
one
is
exceptional
it
is
a
hazy
golden
straw
color
the
head
is
white
firm
and
foamy
clean
pale
malt
aroma
backed
with
a
serious
herbal
novak
hop
scent
the
taste
is
clean
with
lots
of
pale
malt
medium
in
body
and
warmth
is
present
due
to
the
abv
this
is
a
very
rewarding
brew
gotta
give
it
up
for
the
increased
local
flavor
even
if
that
flavor
aint
local
to
me
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
sunset
amber
topped
by
a
finger
of
offcream
foam
the
nose
comprises
buttery
biscuit
light
orange
zest
and
a
hint
of
grass
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
a
diminished
butter
component
and
a
dull
grassy
bitterness
pervading
a
hint
of
dry
wheat
remains
behind
just
in
case
its
one
note
played
loudly
and
discordantly
the
body
is
a
straight
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
drying
finish
overall
though
a
good
idea
and
a
laudable
philosophy
the
end
product
just
doesnt
do
it
for
me
especially
with
that
blunt
bitterness
that
envelops
all
nice
job
wisconsin
the
booze
in
this
was
certainly
up
to
par
for
this
style
but
not
for
a
second
could
i
taste
it
or
felt
it
was
too
strong
so
many
of
lakefronts
offerings
have
been
less
than
stellar
but
anything
with
the
badger
state
prominently
pictured
on
the
bottle
is
worth
every
penny
as
its
an
indicator
that
the
craft
in
craft
beer
will
be
found
in
every
drop
inside
of
the
bottle
when
the
weather
warms
up
again
next
year
this
and
the
wisconsinite
will
be
on
my
musthave
list
and
if
youre
looking
for
a
good
domestic
alternative
to
the
european
beers
of
the
pils
family
you
owe
it
to
yourself
to
get
one
of
these
and
share
it
with
good
friends
on
a
bright
sunny
day
taste

throughout

a
pretty
good

but
like
a

more

liquor
in
the
end
the
meatyraisiny
alcohol
tends
to
dominate
a
bit

much
and
other
elements
soon
fade
a
bit
this
lager
pours
slightly
hazy

with
an
ample
clingy

the
aroma
is

leaving
the

with

with

overall
a
very
flavorful
smooth

with

wellmade
and
quite
unique
the
flavor
opens

with

notes
the
malt
is
balanced
by
a
lower
moderate
level
of

really
comes

reminiscent
of

lemony
taste
starts
sweet

quickly
goes
citrus
in
the
middle
and
closes
with
some
earthy

character
and
a
somewhat
chalky
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
quite
smooth
but
drinkability
is
hindered
by
the
flavors
that
i
wasnt
really
enjoying
just
doesnt
all
come

for
me

this
brew
surprised
me
tasty
i
appreciate
the
opportunity
to
try
this
one
dont
come
to
this
thinking
imperial
pils
but
rather
a
big
real
american
lager
overall
a
nice
beer
from
lakefront
this
is
not
my
favorite
style
but
a
good
representation
of
it
d
for
being
7
you
would
never
know
it
a
light
clean
beer
that
is
pretty
smooth
i
could
drink
more
than
a
few
of
these
in
a
sitting
this
is
what
i
think
the
definition
of
a
session
beer
is
another
decent
offering
from
lakefront
d
if
you
have
one
alone
you
wont
know
what
hint
you
the
7
is
hidden
well
beneath
this
drinkable
lager
thats
both
flavorful
and
intoxicatingly
texturedriven
a
pleasure
to
have
and
at
5
a
22
oz
bottle
its
not
a
bad
deal
bomber
poured
into
imperial
pint
glass
unfilted
hazy
from
dark
gold
on
the
bottom
to
a
ligher
gold
near
the
head
impressive
creamy
of
white
head
retains
for
quite
some
time
excellent
lacing
smell
fresh
grain
slight
citrus
taste
malty
up
front
with
some
bitter
and
citrus
hop
near
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
cream
with
decent
carbonation
i
really
liked
this
beer
which
helps
in
drinkability
but
it
is
filling
mouthfeel
disappointed
in
how
watery
it
is
purchased
a
22
oz
bottle
from
rays
liquors
in
wauwatosa
wi
pours
a
hazy
golden
body
with
a
big
puffy
white
head
aromas
of
bread
dough
and
grassy
hops
medium
bodied
with
low
to
medium
carbonation
this
beer
boasts
big
bready
malt
flavors
from
the
6
row
barley
but
retains
a
smoothness
and
slightly
chewy
mouthfeel
that
gives
way
to
a
medium
hop
bitterness
in
the
semidry
finish
i
found
myself
reaching
often
for
another
gulp
excellent
drinkability
overall
a
good
hoppy
lager
one
needs
to
keep
in
mind
that
this
is
a
lager
when
drinking
so
its
going
to
have
a
different
taste
than
wethopped
pale
ales
also
popular
in
fallwinter
o
an
interesting
take
on
a
trad
pilsner
im
a
fan
of
the
style
and
of
wet
hop
beers
but
this
one
was
kind
of
disapointing
maybe
an
american
style
pilsner
or
an
ipl
with
the
wet
hops
would
be
more
up
my
ally
o
an
imperial
pilsner
for
hop
heads
i
was
glad
to
have
the
chance
to
try
this
special
beer
but
not
eager
to
make
it
a
regular
o
this
may
be
one
of
lfbs
best
beers
i
really
like
the
wet
hops
added
to
the
pilsener
malts
im
going
to
get
another
bottle
of
this
since
i
enjoyed
it
so
much
o
a
well
done
lager
a
more
balanced
impy
pils
than
ive
seen
in
the
past
nice
new
bomber
find
o
this
looks
great
and
has
some
great
hop
flavor
one
of
the
more
interesting
beers
ive
had
from
lakefront
ive
never
seen
the
normal
local
acre
around
here
but
i
saw
the
wet
hop
variation
at
whole
foods
yesterday
and
had
to
pick
it
up
local
acre
wisconsin
wet
hop
ours
a
hazy
straw
color
with
three
fingers
of
head
that
drop
down
leaving
some
decent
lacing
the
aroma
is
a
bit
weak
but
offers
up
nice
grassyfloral
hops
over
some
pilsner
malt
the
taste
brings
those
tastes
to
the
forefront
over
some
relatively
subtle
pilsner
malt
for
a
double
pils
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
slightly
oily
and
the
drinkability
is
solid
overall
a
solid
twist
on
the
fresh
hop
beer
o
not
radically
different
from
the
normal
version
but
i
like
the
normal
version
a
lot
just
a
well
balanced
beer
the
floral
and
citrus
notes
in
the
nose
get
turned
up
here
and
i
like
it
even
more
o
lakefront
expands
on
the
normal
version
of
this
beer
local
acre
dumping
in
fresh
wisconsin
wet
hops
to
create
well
wisconsin
wet
hop
a
unique
result
some
green
characteristics
of
the
fresh
hops
emerge
but
quality
traits
of
the
hops
do
well
to
elevate
the
beer
into
a
dangerously
drinkable
pilsner
and
you
can
go
wrong
with
its
5
price
tag
either
goldenyellowish
in
color
with
a
persistent
two
finger
head
and
some
medium
levels
of
lacing
on
the
glass
smells
very
floral
and
grassy
green
and
tealike
in
hop
character
is
the
best
way
i
can
think
of
to
describe
the
aroma
flavor
has
all
of
the
elements
described
from
the
nose
but
also
including
medium
amounts
of
green
peppercorns
and
a
light
citruspine
garnish
on
top
of
the
semidry
pilsner
malt
alcohol
content
is
hidden
very
well
on
this
one
medium
thickness
and
plenty
of
crisp
sparkling
carbonation
to
keep
things
moving
around
very
fresh
and
clean
in
feel
this
one
is
certainly
worth
trying
i
have
to
admit
the
flavor
did
wear
on
me
a
bit
after
a
half
pint
or
so
that
being
said
im
still
a
bit
unconvinced
on
the
beer
as
a
whole
simply
because
of
the
flavor
this
lager
pours
brilliantly
clear
golden
color
with
a
moderate
white
head
that
leaves
nice
rings
of
lace
all
the
way
down
the
glass
a
good
looking
pils
the
aroma
is
moderately
malty
grainy
and
sweet
spicy
and
floral
hops
also
are
rather
evident
solid
the
flavor
is
a
100
american
version
ingredientwise
of
a
german
pilsner
upfront
bready
sweet
grainy
malts
that
are
quickly
whisked
away
by
moderate
hop
bitterness
and
spicy
hop
flavor
that
pleasantly
lingers
into
the
slightly
dry
finish
the
body
is
medium
and
carbonation
mediumhigh
overall
a
really
well
designed
and
executed
pilsner
one
of
lakefronts
best
offerings
overall
the
other
qualities
of
the
beer
are
consistent
and
pretty
much
average
nice
slight
toasting
to
what
at
times
tastes
like
vienna
malt
anyways
cant
call
a
beer
wet
hop
if
you
cant
even
taste
the
hops
much
less
the
wet
or
fresh
etc
o
this
is
a
great
imperial
pilsner
its
easy
drinking
and
brings
just
enough
hops
into
the
picture
to
keep
things
interesting
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
from
lakefront
good
exhibition
of
almost
noble
wisconsin
hops
the
flavor
could
use
some
reworking
to
create
a
really
great
american
pilsner
the
beer
is
great
it
reminds
me
of
a
higher
hopped
maibock
which
stylewise
i
guess
an
imperial
pilsner
is
just
that
i
would
like
to
have
seen
it
less
sweet
it
does
finish
dry
due
to
the
alcohol
and
is
balanced
well
so
less
sweet
is
debatable
the
hazy
unfiltered
body
kind
of
adds
to
the
whole
local
rustic
mantra
the
beer
embodies
and
brings
some
interesting
nuances
to
the
beer
not
found
in
other
lagers
definitely
would
like
to
grab
this
one
again
before
it
disappears
off
the
shelf
heres
to
lakefront
or
any
other
wisconsin
lageringgreat
im
looking
at
you
new
glarus
and
capital
bringing
us
an
overhopped
summer
pilsner
sometime
soon
o
this
is
a
tasty
creation
from
lakefront
the
alcohol
is
completely
hidden
to
make
for
some
extremely
easy
drinking
at
5
bucks
a
pop
for
a
bomber
this
is
also
a
pretty
good
deal
worth
seeking
out
overall
one
of
my
favorites
from
lakefront
i
think
this
beer
is
what
would
happen
if
somebody
tried
to
make
one
of
the
beers
milwaukee
is
famous
for
using
high
quality
ingredients
instead
of
adjuncts
o
a
clean
and
refreshing
lager
with
a
somewhat
deceptive
7
abv
one
of
lakefronts
best
all
in
all
an
enjoyable
heer
missing
some
crispness
and
a
lighter
body
that
would
help
make
this
a
goto
lager
option
worth
a
try
with
plenty
of
herbal
hop
and
crackery
grain
character
to
lend
palette
interest
interesting
brew
i
have
never
had
a
wet
hop
or
harvest
ale
that
was
this
tasty
thanks
to
downer
ave
wine
and
spirits
in
milwaukee
for
this
one
bomber
pour
in
a
tall
pilsner
glass
gorgeous
slightly
cloudy
with
a
deep
golden
hue
very
sticky
head
thick
and
frothy
that
remained
throughout
the
glass
aromatic
floral
hops
and
bready
malts
are
present
in
the
nose
taste
rich
malts
beer
bread
and
bright
flowery
hops
very
heavy
and
chewy
on
the
mouth
the
wet
hops
dont
add
that
sharpness
that
i
expected
but
they
do
give
this
beer
a
fresh
organic
taste
well
balanced
but
a
bit
rich
to
receive
high
marks
on
drinkability
overall
a
really
tasty
and
very
fresh
imperial
that
i
highly
recommend
aroma
is
perfumy
with
floral
wet
hops
somewhat
green
with
a
little
malt
sweetness
poking
through
also
the
nose
does
strike
me
as
somewhat
lagery
once
i
found
out
it
was
one
daffodil
white
grapes
vegetal
hop
bitterness
in
the
middle
that
lingers
momentarily
medium
bodied
somewhat
dry
in
the
herbal
finish
a
little
bit
of
orange
peel
comes
out
late
its
an
interesting
take
on
a
wethopped
beer
could
be
a
bit
lighter
bodied
to
increase
drinkability
but
overall
solid
another
great
beer
from
the
lakefront
brewery
this
wet
hop
is
100
wi
grown
this
hazy
golden
lager
had
a
fresh
hop
and
citrus
taste
with
great
balance
the
bottle
was
just
as
good
as
when
russ
gave
us
a
sample
during
fermentation
like
beerfmandy
said
for
5
you
cant
go
wrong
with
this
one
nice
work
lakefront
overall
a
good
tasting
imperial
smell
and
mouth
fell
might
be
a
little
overpowering
at
times
but
taste
is
well
balanced
thanks
chocosushi
for
the
opportunity
nice
random
find
at
a
local
shop
never
saw
it
there
before
but
figured
itd
be
worth
a
shot
it
pours
a
clear
orangeamber
topped
by
a
shortlived
finger
of
dirty
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
mandarin
orange
caramel
and
a
touch
of
flowers
the
taste
holds
notes
of
mandarin
orange
syrup
orange
peel
caramel
hard
water
and
a
stiff
backbone
of
flowery
booze
man
does
this
kind
of
hurt
going
down
the
body
is
a
stolid
medium
almost
heftyleaning
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
sorta
syrupy
feel
overall
this
beer
did
not
sit
right
with
me
there
was
very
little
pils
character
it
came
off
more
like
some
kind
of
ampedup
imperial
amber
or
something
just
poorly
done
boo
this
dits
kind
of
a
mess
i
have
trouble
thinking
of
this
as
any
relation
to
a
pilsner
because
i
dont
get
any
of
the
characteristic
hops
that
i
love
in
pilsners
instead
i
got
very
strong
citrus
flavors
mixed
with
a
bready
muddled
mess
of
grain
i
feel
like
some
direction
with
the
hops
could
save
this
beer
the
bottle
says
they
use
four
varieties
keep
it
to
saaz
and
step
up
the
quantity
significantly
big
bodied
but
really
just
too
much
alcohol
to
make
for
a
nice
mouthfeel
some
beers
hide
the
alcohol
well
this
is
not
one
of
them
not
a
very
drinkable
impy
pils
not
bad
my
first
experience
with
this
style
the
hoppy
finish
was
a
nice
surprise
that
kept
this
one
clean
crisp
dpretty
easy
drinking
i
was
expecting
more
of
a
german
hop
punch
in
the
face
with
some
corn
and
graininess
in
the
background
an
interesting
beer
and
a
style
that
id
like
to
try
again
dark
honey
gold
in
color
and
slightly
cloudy
aroma
of
fresh
grain
and
grass
with
a
hint
of
sweetness
it
is
sweet
and
bitter
at
the
same
time
with
a
heavy
undertone
of
malted
grain
and
a
bracing
pilsner
hop
finish
not
as
sweet
and
alcohol
laden
in
flavor
as
many
imperials
pours
a
deep
golden
honey
boardering
on
orange
color
smells
of
corn
malt
grass
pear
and
citrus
with
a
noticable
alcohol
presance
the
taste
is
a
pretty
straight
forward
clean
bitter
lager
flavor
at
first
as
it
warms
and
i
get
more
of
it
in
me
i
pick
up
a
lot
more
complex
bitter
fruity
hop
flavors
and
a
boozy
aftertaste
this
one
will
sneak
up
on
you
very
easy
drinking
for
a
beer
going
on
9
this
is
a
very
interesting
style
its
a
ratcheted
up
pilsner
much
like
an
ipa
is
a
ratcheted
up
pale
ale
i
like
it
smooth
nice
body
to
this
beer
it
is
quite
pleasent
to
swollow
and
for
8
5
abv
nice
it
is
quite
drinkable
for
the
style
i
like
it
d
this
is
an
okay
imperial
pilsener
a
little
boozy
and
lacking
balance
the
medium
to
thick
body
was
creamy
and
smooth
the
carbonation
was
crisp
at
most
which
help
bring
out
the
viscosity
very
easy
to
drink
given
the
strength
of
the
alcohol
and
the
thick
body
a
little
more
from
the
tasting
senses
would
have
helped
round
it
out
properly
the
flavor
mimics
the
aroma
nicely
although
a
hint
of
soapiness
creeps
in
among
the
dusty
pilsner
malt
and
bitter
grassy
german
hop
notes
hops
linger
in
the
finish
alongside
a
bit
of
spicy
medicinal
booze
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
bubbly
and
has
a
nice
weight
for
the
abv
without
becoming
overly
taxing
or
syrupy
on
the
palate
in
sum
a
solidly
built
imperial
pilsner
and
one
id
quickly
reach
for
again
overall
a
very
well
balanced
beer
not
very
complex
but
an
easy
drinker
that
is
worth
seeking
out
one
id
like
to
try
on
tap
this
beer
drinks
nicely
as
noted
previously
its
a
big
old
americanstyle
lager
that
is
hopped
up
with
some
significance
d
this
one
sure
beats
the
whole
hog
6ipa
overall
a
well
constructed
brew
and
a
good
representation
of
a
pils
d
i
cant
see
sitting
and
drinking
several
but
very
nicely
done
in
the
style
unassuming
yet
bold
worth
the
i
paid
3
49
4
pk
but
not
amazing
d
this
pilsner
falls
darn
close
to
a
sessionable
brew
the
medium
body
and
imperial
boost
in
flavor
knock
the
drinkability
down
slightly
but
not
by
a
whole
lot
four
pack
for
8
aint
a
bad
deal
too
bad
the
brews
just
dont
make
a
better
showing
i
first
tried
whole
hog
imperial
pilsner
at
the
brewery
and
shortly
after
its
initial
release
it
was
a
real
eyeopener
at
the
time
the
bottled
version
and
this
sample
in
particular
has
held
up
quite
nicely
considering
the
time
it
has
spent
in
the
bottle
this
is
especially
poignant
considering
the
fact
or
my
opinion
rather
that
the
six
hop
ipa
did
not
hold
up
as
well
of
course
we
all
know
that
the
hop
profile
of
imperial
or
double
ipas
diminishes
with
the
consequence
being
that
the
overall
flavor
profile
diminishes
too
but
these
were
interesting
beers
from
a
heritage
brewery
and
make
me
wonder
whether
you
cant
teach
an
old
dog
new
tricks
nice
beer
by
far
not
the
best
imperial
pilsner
ive
had
thinking
of
golden
revolution
but
nice
for
an
old
brewery
like
point
i
can
see
having
several
of
these
although
deep
down
you
can
tell
its
another
wi
lager
pours
reddishorange
with
a
flurry
of
bubble
activity
that
results
in
a
diminutive
offwhite
head
which
fades
quickly
leaving
little
to
no
lace
behind
smells
malty
and
grassy
with
a
little
fruitiness
in
the
very
back
the
palate
is
nearly
overwhelmed
by
a
huge
spicy
alcohol
heat
but
a
few
notes
of
malt
and
citrus
emerge
just
before
a
nice
little
hop
bite
shows
itself
after
a
while
some
sour
notes
emerge
as
well
goes
down
crisp
with
more
alcohol
brutality
on
the
throat
and
felt
immediately
in
the
stomach
dont
get
me
wrong
i
like
to
taste
the
alcohol
a
bit
in
my
big
beers
but
this
one
really
doesnt
have
much
going
on
in
the
balance
department
that
being
said
as
it
warms
up
and
i
get
used
to
it
it
doesnt
seem
as
harsh
the
imperial
pilsner
as
a
style
doesnt
seem
to
be
doing
it
for
me
and
this
one
doesnt
help
the
cause
d
at
8
5
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
isnt
bad
though
i
think
the
hotness
of
the
alcohol
could
become
hard
to
get
past
after
a
couple
otherwise
a
mighty
fine
precision
lager
very
clear
clean
medium
brass
body
small
shortlived
cottony
white
head
fruity
malt
on
the
nose
with
spearmint
pine
floral
and
resinous
hop
notes
a
little
alcohol
burn
as
well
honey
and
toasted
malt
up
front
becomes
fruitier
and
sweet
with
notes
of
hay
and
cooked
vegetables
solid
hop
bitterness
comes
in
midway
through
herbal
floral
and
mildly
citrus
honey
sweet
finish
with
lingering
herbal
hops
medium
body
with
a
slightly
slick
oily
feel
not
bad
but
not
the
best
imperial
pilsner
ive
had
hv
bitterness
lingers
d
this
beer
has
a
very
soft
hop
profile
and
no
pilsner
qualities
it
is
easy
to
drink
but
a
bit
lack
luster
there
arent
a
lot
of
imperial
pilsners
around
and
every
one
ive
had
has
been
different
from
the
rest
this
one
was
interesting
but
maybe
a
little
old
as
i
dont
get
the
flavors
other
reviewers
note
let
the
experimentation
continue
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
good
bite
of
carbonation
very
enjoyable
stevens
point
so
far
so
good
looking
forward
to
what
else
youre
gonna
bring
to
the
mountain
state
d
this
is
one
of
the
first
beers
i
have
ever
had
to
pour
out
it
was
miserable
from
start
to
finish
for
some
reason
i
couldnt
stop
belching
while
i
was
drinking
this
it
was
like
i
ate
a
bowl
of
potpourri
i
will
say
that
the
name
was
appealing
but
i
could
not
handle
the
whole
hog
half
of
it
was
dumped
onto
the
campfire
it
was
sad
day
i
really
enjoyed
this
imperial
pilsner
from
stevens
point
so
drinkable
and
what
i
look
for
in
a
quality
pilsner
drinks
easy
enough
for
the
style
abv
but
not
one
ill
be
seeking
out
i
should
start
by
saying
german
style
pilsner
is
my
favorite
kind
of
beer
this
beer
reminded
me
of
what
i
had
in
germany
it
didnt
let
me
down
where
other
american
attempts
have
no
defects
clean
crisp
maltiness
with
a
strong
hop
assertiveness
what
a
real
pilsner
is
all
about
thick
creamy
head
hallertau
hop
aroma
taste
was
cracker
crispness
with
a
sharp
bite
pleasantly
surprised
other
brewers
should
take
note
in
this
beer
how
did
they
do
this
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
two
inches
of
white
head
that
had
great
retention
the
head
eventually
settles
to
a
thick
cap
heavy
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
unfortunately
the
appearance
is
the
best
part
of
this
beer
very
tame
aroma
immediately
after
the
pour
i
thought
i
smelled
cooked
corn
but
it
was
just
briefly
then
it
is
just
faint
hop
herbalfloral
aromas
and
some
cereal
grains
the
flavor
is
not
that
big
considering
it
is
an
imperial
until
you
get
to
the
finish
then
it
is
bitter
and
boozy
not
my
favorite
combination
extremely
dry
the
body
is
rather
modest
as
well
considerly
the
abv
and
bitterness
but
it
does
have
nice
carbonation
i
think
the
brewer
missed
the
mark
need
more
from
the
hops
besides
bitterness
and
a
bigger
malt
bill
nothing
unpalatable
about
this
beer
it
could
be
so
much
better
no
head
on
aggressive
pour
flat
clear
yellow
with
some
carbonation
bubbles
around
the
perimeter
of
the
glass
malts
on
the
nose
ethanol
flat
tasting
oxidized
fully
body
though
lacking
any
flavor
really
hurts
its
drink
ability
d
not
too
impressive
no
more
than
a
few
for
drinkability
as
already
said
this
brew
is
exactly
what
an
imperial
pilsner
should
be
floral
and
lightly
malty
with
a
satisfying
quality
and
crisp
finish
all
this
is
present
only
the
brew
is
very
flavorful
and
carries
an
8
5
apv
tag
very
well
crafted
and
pleasant
to
drink
it
is
a
wonder
that
more
of
this
style
has
not
been
seen
cheers
drinkability
wouldnt
want
any
more
than
probably
2
of
these
due
to
the
mouthfeel
was
expecting
a
bit
more
in
the
aroma
and
taste
categories
but
was
still
a
good
brew
kudos
to
point
for
trying
something
outside
of
their
normal
offering
this
is
drinkable
far
beyond
its
listed
strength
and
has
many
things
going
for
it
but
and
maybe
im
over
sensitive
the
bubblegum
esters
on
the
nose
and
in
the
taste
knock
this
one
down
a
good
deal
subtract
them
and
youve
got
a
nice
fat
pils
here
or
at
least
a
hoppy
maibock
wow
not
to
experienced
with
imperial
pils
but
this
is
quite
nice
d
it
wouldve
been
a
5
but
it
is
8
5
beer
and
i
take
a
little
away
from
that
since
it
is
so
high
id
recommend
trying
this
beer
even
if
your
not
a
fan
of
the
style
tastes
of
honey
and
grass
heavier
and
richer
than
it
looks
at
first
enough
carbonation
to
balance
it
out
light
not
bad
very
drinkable
marathon
beer
this
beer
has
a
clean
white
head
and
moderate
lacing
it
has
a
sweatness
and
alcoholic
taste
reminding
me
of
a
bock
helles
bock
fits
this
verse
pilsner
a
liitle
too
malty
even
though
i
know
its
a
pils
overall
nice
color
decent
mouthfeel
purchase
by
december
2013
its
july
of
14
uh
oh
12oz
bottle
poured
into
stange
lovely
auburn
color
with
thin
white
head
that
quickly
fades
no
lacing
aroma
indicates
oxidation
but
caramel
malt
comes
through
flavor
is
pleasantly
malty
however
tinny
oxidation
is
hard
to
get
over
medium
body
creamy
texture
lower
carbonation
semidry
finish
drank
a
quarter
and
then
drain
poured
but
would
definitely
give
a
fresh
one
a
shot
very
bland
a
lot
of
room
for
improvement
i
generally
do
not
like
pilsner
but
this
one
has
a
strong
malt
taste
with
a
subtle
happy
aftertaste
much
flavor
very
hoppy
of
course
i
like
this
beer
served
best
in
a
chilled
beer
mug
poured
from
the
bottle
overall
i
wouldnt
necessarily
classify
this
as
an
imperial
pils
more
like
a
helles
bock
very
nice
nonetheless
not
sure
what
i
expected
from
an
uber
pils
but
this
is
too
bitter
for
my
liking
and
the
alcohol
overwhelms
the
floral
hops
are
nice
but
the
esters
detract
o
meh
every
once
in
a
while
sipping
this
ill
think
hey
its
a
decent
brew

i
thought
it
was
very
pleasant
and
a
bit
surprising
im
normally
more
of
a
pa
or
ipa
drinker
but
this
pilsner
was
quite
a
surprise
a
friend
of
mine
likened
it
to
a
light
pale
ale
i
would
drink
it
again
i
think
it
would
be
great
on
a
warm
summer
afternoon
to
have
a
couple
of
these
unfortunately
those
warm
afternoons
are
gone
for
a
few
months
o
this
beer
seems
like
it
could
use
more
hops
and
less
alcohol
in
the
taste
the
finish
on
this
beer
is
a
bit
too
dry
for
my
liking
poured
from
the
bottle
small
craft
is
a
limpid
amber
showing
steady
streams
of
small
round
bubbles
the
aroma
blends
malt
yeast
and
some
hops
this
beer
has
a
creamy
mouth
feel
and
a
sweetness
that
is
not
a
typical
pilsner
flavor
profile
and
it
brings
bitter
hops
sweet
malt
and
a
distinct
alcohol
note
it
leaves
a
bitter
hoppy
finish
i
dont
think
that
pilsner
is
as
amenable
to
the
imperial
treatment
as
other
styles
ipa
stout
and
can
come
off
overwrought
so
i
will
tend
away
from
this
overall
it
is
a
very
tasty
and
soothing
brew
with
some
nice
sweet
bready
flavors
one
to
sit
back
and
enjoy
note
almost
a
year
past
the
freshness
date
the
age
didnt
harm
the
brew
at
all
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
level
of
carbonation
a
bit
too
much
residual
sugar
is
in
the
finish
which
ruins
the
expected
crispness
i
look
for
in
this
style
regardless
it
is
not
bad
worth
trying
but
not
particularly
something
i
would
buy
again
overall
the
bitterness
is
just
right
and
this
is
a
nicely
flavorful
pils
cheers

some

i
liked
it
a

the

was

uber

is
a
good
description
not
much
carbonation
in
there
for
a
pilsner
o
nice
beer
and
the
first
double
pils
i
have
ever
had
tasty
o
overall
i
thought
it
was
mediocre
for
an
imperial
pils
i
would
have
liked
a
more
pronounced
malt
character
the
hops
are
spot
on
and
the
appearance
is
nice
i
guess
i
just
expected
more
i
wont
be
drinking
another
because
ive
had
regular
craft
pilsners
with
better

a
brilliant
orange
golden
forming
a
tall
peaking
whipped
meringuelike
white

with
amazing

d
a
soundly
made
beer
that
is
simple
enough
that
it
doesnt
require
intense
pondering
yet
complex
enough
to
allow
such
i
would
gladly
have
another
d
im
a
bit
of
a
sucker
for
pilsners
and
double
pilsners
so
it
easy
to
drink
and
flavors
suit
me
an
inconsistent
imperial
pilsner
that
is
surprisingly
refreshing
the
lack
of
hops
is
disappointing
but
maybe
a
larger
hop
presence
would
be
to
distracting
as
is
though
i
could
pound
these
back
during
a
nice
hot
summer
afternoon
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
some
lingering
malt
sweetness
and
slight
hop
bitterness
drinkability
is
modest
for
sure
the
high
malt
character
makes
me
want
to
stop
after
one
d
an
easy
drinker
for
such
a
high
abv
though
this
beer
seems
fairly
plain
and
very
out
of
touch
with
balance
faint
grains
adjunct
sweetness
and
the
boozy
character
just
dont
do
it
for
me
worth
a
try
but
i
wont
be
purchasing
again
d
kind
of
grudgingly
finished
the
6
pack
over
a
couple
weeks
each
time
it
was
more
and
more
forcing
myself
to
drink
it
so
it
would
go
away
i
really
like
everything
else
ive
tasted
from
heavy
seasclipper
city
this
just
isnt
my
thing
dhas
a
unique
taste
but
super
easy
to
drink
a
good
pilsner
imo
would
get
this
again
d
love
this
beer
especially
on
the
warmer
days
a
good
offering
i
look
forward
to
picking
up
again
and
again
a
fine
job
keeping
the
bigger
body
balanced
by
the
massive
hops
not
your
typical
pils
but
with
all
the
things
you
expect
from
the
pils
style
just
big
and
bolder
for
a
pilsner
it
tasted
much
more
citrus
and
malt
oriented
then
hopped
still
tasted
good
the
taste
was
subtle
and
short
the
mouthfeel
is
thicker
and
less
refreshing
than
most
pilsners
but
it
still
feels
good
the
drinkability
also
isnt
as
good
as
most
pilsners
because
of
the
amped
up
flavor
and
thickness
but
its
still
quite
drinkable
a
solid
beer
another
enjoyable
offering

and
not
much
body
smells
of
citrus
mostly
grapefruit
and
lime
taste
flavors
of
grapefruit
lime
lemon
tangerine
and
traces
of
malt
moderate
body
with
some
fizz
and
a
dry
finish
good
flavor
and
body
may
have
to
have
more
since
i
have
two
more
in
the
fridge
heavy
seas
uber
pils
has
slightly
transparent
orange
colour
and
a
decent
head
that
fades
to
good
lacing
quite
quickly
the
smell
is
very
grainy
with
some
hops
the
taste
is
grainy
to
begin
and
has
a
little
honey
flavour
and
a
crisp
hoppy
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
thick
and
nice
its
not
overly
carbonated
this
is
a
very
drinkable
if
not
especially
interesting
beer
great
drinkability
even
at
7
abv
i
definitely
applaud
heavy
seas
for
this
one
im
not
the
biggest
pilsner
fan
but
i
tend
to
seek
this
one
out
when
im
in
the
mood
may
not
wow
you
but
you
will
be
pretty
satisfied
d
nice
take
on
the
classic
pilsner
i
liked
the
lower
carb
on
it
made
it
much
smoother
drinkability
this
is
a
great
drink
not
too
bitter
and
deceptively
rich
another
beer
mike
got
for
his
wedding
thanks
for
a
great
time
and
looking
out
bro
bright
medium
gold
with
good
carbonation
the
aroma
is
sweet
alcohol
with
some
hops
the
taste
is
much
sweeter
than
the
aroma
lots
of
alcohol
typical
pilsner
skunky
hop
not
my
thing
d
small
craft
warning
has
some
strong
flavor
for
being
in
the
double
pilsner
category
the
commitment
to
the
pilsner
style
still
makes
it
very
delicious
heavy
seas
keep
up
these
brews
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
i
wish
i
had
bought
more
of
it
would
certainly
order
at
a
pub
purchase
in
a
store
or
accept
as
a
gift
well
done
golden
straw
color
very
clear
super
white
head
swirl
brings
back
a
12
head
at
any
time
great
carbonation
very
light
pale
malt
aroma
faint
notes
of
orange
and
lemon
carbonation
is
great
in
mouthfeel
very
crisp
lagery
sweetness
some
faint
breadiness
and
orange
peel
in
flavor
not
superflavorful
but
pretty
true
to
style
very
light
clean
refreshing
and
drinkable
one
of
my
more
favorites
from
heavy
seas
im
sorry
this
aint
no
imperial
anything
its
a
good
solid
pils
but
not
amped
up
in
any
way
apparently
brewed
for
the
masses
this
beer
is
totally
safe
and
does
not
push
the
envelope
in
any
way
shape
or
form
slightly
above
average
this
is
a
pilsner
for
the
ipaloving
crowd
lets
hear
it
for
imperial
pilsners
d
one
bottle
itself
is
very
drinkable
and
its
so
refreshing
youre
likely
to
go
for
another
but
the
alcohol
in
this
beer
hits
you
hard
and
except
for
the
first
bottle
i
had
it
is
hidden
extremely
well
8
bottles
of
this
and
youre
really
finished
d
only
glad
to
have
tried
this
but
i
think
that
this
is
a
one
and
done
beer
i
can
imagine
brewers
sitting
around
thinking
hmmm
whats
left
that
we
havent
imperialized
yet
pumping
up
a
pils
seems
like
a
task
that
could
go
badly
wrong
but
clipper
city
did
quite
the
nice
job
of
making
it
bigger
without
losing
sight
of
the
basic
style
altogether
much
more
hops
than
the
style
creeping
well
into
pale
ale
territory
but
still
retaining
the
basic
crispness
of
the
style
the
drinkability
suffers
from
the
abundance
of
flavor
this
is
not
a
session
beer
good
to
sip
d
easy
drinking
adip
i
got
this
one
in
a
trade
but
would
like
to
try
other
clipper
city
brands
i
recommend
this
one
and
hope
to
get
this
again
malty
smells
and
a
light
pour
but
the
hoppy
taste
more
than
accomplishes
enough
to
make
you
want
to
drink
a
6
pack
of
these
7
abv
is
a
peculiarity
i
hardly
taste
that
and
that
makes
me
incredibly
pleased
ill
stick
with
other
heavy
seas
but
if
you
needed
a
pilsner
why
not
try
this
one
d
a
pretty
good
pilsener
i
enjoyed
the
fruit
in
the
taste
more
than
the
smell
would
try
again
i
have
had
this
beer
before
but
this
is
the
first
time
i
have
really
given
it
a
serious
look
and
i
am
definitely
becoming
a
fan
d
extremely
this
is
a
very
good
beer
id
buy
it
again
an
imperial
pilsner
i
had
no
idea
this
style
or
beer
existed
before
my
parents
picked
me
up
a
mixed
pack
pours
a
pale
orange
colour
a
bit
darker
than
a
normal
pilsner
nice
head
and
ok
retention
down
the
glass
smell
is
of
lots
of
grassy
hops
the
hop
flavour
is
incredible
in
this
basically
a
hopped
up
pilsner
a
little
bit
syrupy
in
the
mouthfeel
but
smooth
enough
i
cant
remember
how
many
of
these
were
in
the
mixed
pack
but
by
the
time
i
got
to
my
parents
place
my
dad
had
only
left
me
one
of
these
he
was
a
big
fan
too
d
ok
the
abv
is
a
little
high
for
a
session
brew
and
not
bad
for
1
or
2
favors
are
very
balance
and
makes
for
a
very
nice
experience
im
having
a
hard
time
seeing
this
as
a
pils
i
guess
that
is
why
it
is
uber
pils
worth
looking
into
another
good
beer
from
clipper
a
refreshing
beer
i
liked
it
i
like
this
beer
and
think
its
pretty
good
example
of
the
style
good
drinkability
it
went
down
real
easy
not
really
sure
what
a
uber
pils
is
or
that
ive
had
an
american
doubleimperial
pilsner
before
but
this
was
a
good
session
beer
thats
worth
trying
not
my
favorite
but
a
good
drinking
beer
that
should
be
tried
i
tried
mine
at
the
heorot
in
muncie
indiana
the
beer
is
tasty
and
not
hoppy
which
is
important
to
me
i
find
myself
gravitating
more
to
ipas
as
i
get
older
if
you
have
not
tried
it
irecomend
it
d
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
has
just
enough
punch
at
7
abv
to
be
really
dangerous
its
also
one
of
those
beers
that
you
wouldnt
guess
to
be
dangerous
in
other
words
be
careful
and
the
drinkability
is
great
taste
is
much
sweeter
than
the
smell
suggests
grapefruit
and
citrus
hops
are
much
more
prevalent
than
the
more
common
and
more
bitter
hops
normally
found
in
a
pilsner
and
a
touch
of
yeast
the
malt
is
biscuity
and
sweet
while
the
hops
are
crisp
sweet
the
beer
is
quite
sweet
in
general
but
very
clean
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
light
carbonation
but
the
taste
is
almost
overpoweringly
sweet
finished
strong
quite
drinkable
but
the
flavor
is
almost
too
much
for
something
that
seems
light
in
many
other
ways
im
a
fan
of
pilsners
im
not
exactly
sure
what
an
uber
pils
is
but
its
not
like
most
pilsners
ive
drank
its
light
and
crisp
and
with
a
7
0
abv
you
really
cant
taste
the
alcohol
i
could
see
kicking
back
and
enjoying
one
with
friends
it
gives
a
nice
spicy
tingle
on
your
tongue
and
drinks
decently
for
a
high
abv
brew
pours
a
cloudy
gold
with
a
small
white
head
aromas
are
similar
to
but
less
pronounced
than
those
of
an
ipa
an
applelike
sweetness
strongly
backed
by
a
complex
array
of
citrusy
hops
the
taste
is
on
the
tropical
fruit
and
mango
elements
with
lightly
lemony
and
resinous
hops
supporting
the
sweet
cotton
candy
malts
on
the
finish
overall
this
beer
is
well
balanced
and
devoid
of
any
sort
of
sharp
offensive
corners
makes
for
a
nice
night
cap
sweet
pilsner
malt
aroma
honey
cookie
dough
husky
grain
flavor
follows
the
nose
but
with
an
earthy
hop
aftertaste
rich
maltiness
with
very
minor
bitterness
in
the
finish
definitely
a
malt
forward
lager
the
label
describes
it
as
a
rich
golden
bock
lager
full
bodied
yet
not
heavy
im
still
sipping
this
though
enjoyable
as
it
warms
sticky
texture
the
breadiness
and
honey
notes
come
out
a
bit
more
dark
yellow
with
just
a
slight
haze
started
with
a
thick
foamy
head
but
didnt
last
very
long
steady
active
carbonation
light
lemony
citrus
aroma
along
with
a
subtly
sweet
malty
smell
very
fresh
smelling
with
subdued
hop
aroma
very
light
feel
with
the
carbonation
so
light
that
it
nearly
goes
unnoticed
for
the
higher
abv
this
has
a
very
light
body
sweet
malty
flavors
in
the
front
that
slowly
roll
into
a
light
citrus
hop
flavor
followed
by
a
light
alcoholic
finish
finishes
very
clean
though
very
refreshing
and
drinkable
poured
a
translucent
yellow
with
a
high
carbonation
content
one
finger
of
white
poor
retention
and
average
lacing
the
nose
revealed
a
decent
noble
hops
presence
along
with
some
grass
hay
and
earthiness
the
taste
yielded
the
same
flavors
but
not
as
pronounced
with
a
thin
dry
finish
thin
bodied
and
highly
carbonated
overall
good
for
sessioning
but
would
benefit
from
slightly
more
body
and
flavor
balance
side
note
my
first
beer
from
clipper
city
brewing
and
if
the
rest
are
like
this
i
cant
wait
to
try
them
all
freshness
notched
until
810
pours
a
nice
deep
golden
small
fizzyyetsticky
head
and
a
lot
of
suspended
particles
a
hoppy
lean
on
the
nose
also
some
alcohol
odor
tastes
like
it
smells
bready
with
a
decent
enough
twang
on
the
end
and
a
little
extra
kick
of
alcohol
citrusy
too
much
reminiscent
of
a
pale
ale
how
these
imperial
x
beers
confound
me
mouthfeel
is
light
if
only
a
bit
astringent
easy
to
drink
d
one
of
the
more
drinkable
double
pils
has
a
nice
hop
profile
to
it
while
staying
true
to
the
style
overall
ok
drinkability
i
dont
think
i
could
do
a
six
and
a
single
was
enough
for
me
dont
hate
this
and
this
could
be
neat
change
of
pace
some
days
but
not
a
session
beer
worht
a
try
well
crafted
deep
gold
to
light
brown
little
to
no
head
spicy
hop
aroma
migngled
with
malt
definately
a
pils
noble
german
hops
dominate
but
not
overpowering
nicely
balanced
starts
and
finishes
clean
feels
nice
on
the
palate
very
drinkable
i
should
buy
this
for
my
macro
friends
who
sometimes
get
daring
and
are
willing
to
experiment
i
would
have
no
hesitation
in
swigging
a
few
of
these
by
the
pool
in
the
heat
of
summer
once
i
was
assured
that
there
was
a
competent
lifeguard
who
could
retrieve
me
from
the
bottom
of
the
deep
end
once
the
heavy
seas
have
washed
over
me
recommended
d
after
one
of
these
im
ready
for
something
different
overall
good
beer
though
more
like
an
ipa
then
pils
overall
this
brew
is
a
unique
one
for
reminding
me
of
drinking
water
not
much
taste
going
on
it
has
a
hardy
body
feel
to
it
i
recommended
this
to
my
bro
who
isnt
to
crazy
with
strong
beers
too
much
hops
or
malt
action
and
liked
it
and
i
can
see
why
if
you
want
a
hardy
brew
but
without
much
backing
it
up
i
say
go
for
it
its
clean
and
crisp
and
subtle
so
this
is
an
imperialpilsner
eh
not
bad
but
honestly
a
style
i
dont
see
the
need
to
overindulge
with
ingredients
give
me
a
regular
german
or
czech
pilsner
anytime
mouthfeel
is
light
a
bit
slick
with
okay
carbonation
crisp
good
drinkability
but
this
beer
didnt
wow
me
or
anything
way
decent
a
little
tame
in
the
overall
impact
but
the
impact
is
sublime
despite
the
muddled
aspects
apparent
to
taste
i
found
myself
enjoying
uber
pils
quite
a
lot
sure
i
would
also
like
either
more
spiciness
or
more
carbonation
these
are
both
relatively
minor
points
of
contention
at
7
abv
this
is
rather
potent
the
taste
is
such
id
want
to
drink
it
all
night
even
though
i
know
two
or
three
would
be
reasonable
no
sir
i
dont
like
it
d
not
too
drinkable
syrupy
and
rather
strong
while
that
might
be
a
weird
compliment
it
doesnt
say
much
for
it
being
a
lager
overall
this
is
pretty
good
but
not
great
for
the
style
the
less
beer
snobbish
people
i
was
at
the
beach
with
liked
it
more
than
i
did
this
beer
doesnt
look
too
great
its
a
bit
past
the
recommended
drinkby
date
a
nice
amber
color
with
little
head
a
strong
grassy
scent
thats
pleasing
the
taste
is
a
bit
faded
but
i
remember
it
being
reminiscent
of
a
good
pilsner
though
a
little
stronger
due
to
the
imperial
status
a
decent
overall
beer
that
would
make
nice
for
a
session
with
friends
pours
a
dark
macro
yellow
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
strong
pilsner
malt
the
flavor
is
reminiscent
of
iced
tea
not
too
much
alcohol
or
hop
character
in
the
beer
medium
slightly
cream
mouthfeel
and
low
carbonation
the
beer
is
a
bit
sticky
on
the
tongue
with
a
light
body
a
bit
crisp
and
biting
but
the
carbonation
was
less
than
expected
clean
aroma
and
flavors
and
smooth
drinking
make
this
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
overall
i
was
quite
happy
with
this
beer
better
than
your
average
pilsner
definetly
a
beer
id
buy
to
drink
regularly
if
i
wanted
a
pilsner
the
heavy
seas
sampler
is
definetly
worth
picking
up
drinkability
with
a
heavier
body
and
higher
abv
than
most
pilsners
this
is
one
to
be
savored
a
bit
that
said
could
have
one
or
two
of
these
easily
good
drinkability
and
flavor
for
a
relatively
big
pilsner
very
enjoyable
poured
into
a
chilled
pint
glass
dark
yellow
to
orange
color
2
finger
head
floating
yeast
in
bottle
that
was
not
possible
to
avoid
pouring
out
first
taste
very
balanced
nothing
over
powering
roasted
malt
flavor
but
without
any
over
hopping
very
small
bubbles
make
it
a
refreshing
drink
i
could
drink
several
of
these
despite
the
7
0
abv
d
this
is
nothing
special
will
not
purchase
again
d
im
not
really
a
pilsner
guy
but
this
is
an
awesome
pilsner
and
it
drinks
really
well
would
work
well
as
an
introductory
brew
bottle
into
pint
glass
pours
a
beautiful
amber
with
little
head
that
quickly
faded
i
spent
a
lot
of
time
taking
in
the
complex
aromas
that
hit
the
nose
with
this
one
i
was
able
to
pick
up
loads
of
the
toasted
malts
but
also
hints
of
apple
and
honey
and
various
spices
i
couldnt
single
out
once
i
went
in
for
a
drink
i
was
not
disappointed
the
complexity
on
the
nose
played
very
well
balanced
on
the
tongue
the
alcohol
hits
but
it
is
very
well
disguised
by
the
heavy
but
nowhere
near
overpowering
malt
sweetness
a
firm
hope
bite
at
the
end
gives
a
nice
crisp
finish
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
for
its
abv
it
is
pretty
easy
drinking
as
mentioned
before
there
really
isnt
any
intense
flavors
that
would
make
this
difficult
to
drink
a
few
glasses
of
in
an
evening
that
being
said
there
really
isnt
anything
special
about
the
flavor
either
its
a
decent
drinkable
beer
but
not
something
i
would
buy
often
the
mix
12
pack
that
this
came
in
was
decent
for
the
price
though
d
overall
quite
drinkable
because
of
the
styles
versatility
a
beer
for
all
seasons
drinkability
for
the
abv
its
certainly
drinkable
but
there
isnt
much
to
set
this
apart
from
the
macro
beers
this
one
disappointed
me
drinkability
a
good
beer
and
a
great
pilsner
being
an
imperial
pilsner
it
has
more
maltiness
than
your
gardenvariety
pils
very
interesting
and
definitely
worth
a
shot
this
one
only
falls
slightly
above
average
for
me
it
just
didnt
do
enough
it
seemed
a
little
too
tame
and
a
little
too
generic
drinkable
enough
in
its
way
but
i
wanted
something
more
drinkability
could
have
about
23
of
these
but
thats
it
solid
session
brew
though
this
is
a
well
built
craft
one
that
provides
any
sealoving
beer
drinker
with
a
refreshing
quaff
in
any
case
try
to
get
past
the
nautical
motif
used
in
this
review
and
get
some
ok
this
has
just
become
one
of
my
favorite
pilsners
not
quite
the
top
of
the
list
but
well
above
average
great
drinkability
poured
from
12
ounce
bottle
into
a
unibroue
tulip
one
pinky
of
white
head
doesnt
last
very
long
golden
body
has
aroma
of
citrusy
hops
and
sweet
malts
taste
like
a
sweeter
than
average
pilsner
very
easy
and
pleasant
to
drink
their
description
on
their
website
indicates
a
pilsner
style
bock
lager
that
actually
makes
perfect
sense
either
way
whatever
style
it
is
its
pretty
tasty
this
beer
got
better
as
i
reviewed
it
ive
never
had
an
imperial
pilsner
before
but
this
was
a
pretty
solid
beer
tasty
smooth
and
pretty
damn
drinkable
even
at
over
7
12oz
bottle
served
in
a
pilsener
glass
best
by
may09
notched
on
the
label
guess
i
should
have
looked
closer
poured
a
translucent
orangegold
with
a
dense
creamy
two
inch
bright
white
head
head
eventually
recedes
into
a
solid
half
inch
cap
with
delicate
strands
of
lacing
forming
during
the
tasting
good
retention
and
adherence
nose
is
maltybreasy
sweet
maybe
a
hint
of
toffee
taste
is
consistent
with
nose
however
some
slight
bittering
hops
comes
out
in
the
mix
as
well
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
with
a
pleasant
yet
subtle
background
effervescence
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
from
an
imperial
pils
but
i
was
fairly
pleased
for
the
most
part
definitely
worth
a
try
in
the
finish
there
is
a
touch
of
boozy
heat
but
there
is
no
astringent
alcoholic
flavor
the
beer
is
surprisingly
smooth
almost
too
much
so
however
even
with
the
relatively
high
alcohol
content
of
this
beer
the
drinkability
factor
is
high
almost
dangerously
so
i
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
my
sa
perfect
pint
glass
it
pours
orangeyellow
with
a
thin
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
the
aroma
is
very
bready
with
alot
of
herbal
notes
the
flavor
is
bready
with
citrus
and
herbs
intertwined
the
finish
is
sweet
and
lingers
the
beer
is
light
bodied
and
has
average
carbonation
something
in
the
flavor
doesnt
really
work
for
me
i
dont
think
i
will
grab
another
of
these
anytime
soon
overall
this
is
one
of
the
cleaner
examples
of
the
style
ive
had
so
far
nothing
exceptional
but
worth
a
shot
one
finger
head
that
leaves
pretty
quick
decent
orangish
pale
color
the
smell
is
very
malty
with
some
hops
mixed
in
you
can
taste
the
malt
and
hops
as
well
as
some
fruitieness
too
not
bad
at
all
i
wouldnt
say
its
watery
but
it
could
use
a
more
fullflavored
taste
all
in
all
its
a
pretty
good
pilsner
overall
not
bad
perhaps
just
not
in
the
style
i
like
average
wine
specialist6pack9

d
good
drinkability
seems
like
what
an
american
lager
is
supposed
to
taste
like
the
fact
that
this
is
rated
as
highly
as
it
is
makes
me
lose
faith
in
ba
just
more
of
the
same
poured
a
hazy
amber
with
a
one
finger
head
that
quickly
reduced
to
a
thin
cover
i
swear
that
i
can
pick
out
hops
in
the
aroma
but
the
tongue
doesnt
back
the
nose
the
taste
was
a
nice
modest
sweetness
there
is
a
taste
here
that
i
like
a
lot
but
cannot
name
ive
been
reading
all
the
master
baers
taste
descriptions
searching
for
that
elusive
flavor
and
cant
find
it
this
is
frustrating
but
i
will
drink
again
and
again
until
i
can
figure
it
out
oh
how
i
suffer
for
this
craft
mouth
feel
was
medium
bodied
with
low
carbonation
drinkability
was
very
good
this
was
my
first
imperial
pilsner
and
it
was
a
pleasant
surprise
nothing
at
all
like
a
regular
pils
im
going
to
have
to
go
through
the
list
of
highly
rated
american
doubleimperial
pils
and
see
what
ive
been
missing
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
golden
color
with
a
1
inch
head
smell
is
mild
some
hints
of
hops
taste
is
hoppy
with
some
maltiness
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
this
is
not
a
beer
i
could
continually
drink
overall
this
is
a
mediocre
beer
conclusion
i
really
liked
this
id
been
searching
for
it
for
awhile
found
it
on
vacation
and
tonight
we
paired
it
with
a
simple
margheritastyle
pizza
and
it
was
quite
nice
mfd
mediumheavy
body
alcohol
is
well
hidden
smooth
going
down
long
bready
finish
d
easy
to
drink
somewhat
refreshing
even
at
7
not
my
favorite
from
the
heavy
seas
sampler
but
still
a
good
beer
this
is
a
good
brew
and
one
im
glad
i
tried
two
solid
brews
thus
far
from
clipper
city
d
a
very
drinkable
beer
even
for
being
a
7abv
not
necessarily
my
favorite
and
not
quite
sure
you
can
actually
call
it
a
true
pilsner
imperial
or
otherwise
but
still
definitely
worth
a
try
pours
a
light
copper
color
iwth
a
soapy
white
head
that
left
some
sticky
lacing
as
it
settled
the
aroma
is
rather
light
there
is
some
toasted
malt
smell
toasted
bread
the
beer
starts
off
grassy
and
bitter
then
is
balanced
with
a
bready
malt
the
grassy
bitterness
stays
throughout
i
seem
to
pick
up
some
very
light
citrus
hops
as
well
the
malt
is
not
nearly
as
dry
and
cracker
like
as
most
pils
but
for
an
imperial
pils
that
is
to
be
expected
moderate
body
with
softer
carbonation
leans
on
the
dry
and
bitter
side
im
not
a
big
fan
of
the
style
as
it
doesnt
make
much
sense
to
me
as
i
see
traditional
pils
to
be
delicate
with
fairly
low
abv
it
is
just
not
a
style
that
needs
to
be
imperialed
that
being
said
the
beer
tries
to
stay
true
to
being
a
pils
as
it
has
grassy
notes
and
is
fairly
dry
smells
hoppy
with
some
citrus
spicy
hops
and
some
floral
senses
to
it
smooth
taste
plenty
of
hops
some
malts
somewhat
yeasty
and
a
touch
of
citrus
mediumlight
body
with
an
all
around
average
taste
easy
to
drink
though

this
was
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
would
have
no

putting
away
more
than
a
few
drinkability
while
the
beer
went
down
fast
i
just
dont
want
to
drink
more
then
one
per
night
d
tasty
but
high
alcohol
nice
light
sweet
flavor
and
great
auroma
to
match
you
definitely
need
to
give
this
one
a
try
if
you
havent
already
d
this
was
a
smooth
one
and
had
great
balance
wish
i
had
more
of
them
ontap
at
flying
saucer
served
in
a
standard
pint
glass
a
crisp
but
slightly
murky
light
orange
with
a
thin
khaki
head
that
diminishes
to
a
thin
layer
aroma
is
slight
sweet
malts
and
crisp
hops
the
taste
is
a
muddled
blend
of
overly
sweet
malts
and
tangy
hops
that
dont
seem
to
get
along
that
well
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
with
an
aggressive
amount
of
sweetness
this
one
is
not
what
i
expect
in
an
imperial
pilsner
or
even
a
pilsner
for
that
matter
d
i
thought
it
was
enjoyable
and
flavorful
but
nothing
special
im
rating
it
as
a
beer
id
rate
it
lower
if
i
was
rating
it
as
a
pils
d
not
usually
big
on
the
pilsners
but
i
really
like
this
one
well
its
very
drinkable
because
the
flavor
is
rather
inoffensive
i
really
expected
more
hop
bitterness
from
this
but
its
still
a
pretty
good
strong
pils
d
id
have
two
and
probably
walk
away
its
tough
to
session
any
heavy
seas
offering
because
of
the
abv
but
this
one
is
pretty
nice
and
easy
drinking
d
very
nice
love
when
i
can
find
a
good
pilsner
especially
of
the
imperial
variety
this
is
a
pretty
big
bodied
lager
with
a
decent
amount
of
carbonation
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
something
worth
trying
but
not
a
regular
buy
for
me
pilsner
is
not
my
favorite
style
this
beer
poured
a
golden
yellow
with
a
two
finger
tight
white
head
head
had
very
good
retention
with
thin
sheets
of
lacing
left
along
the
glass
the
entire
way
down
the
nose
could
have
had
more
there
was
a
hint
of
sweetness
slight
citrus
hops
with
a
bready
overtone
to
it
taste
starts
with
a
touch
of
slight
toasted
malts
and
some
light
hops
mostly
of
muted
malts
and
a
bit
of
biscuit
with
a
kick
this
is
a
lighter
bodied
beer
with
higher
carbonation
crisp
mouthfeel
goes
down
relatively
easily
this
is
a
decent
beer
if
this
is
your
style
of
beer
its
one
that
you
could
sit
with
for
a
bit
i
really
like
the
hop3
so
i
was
excited
to
try
this
one
after
primapils
this
has
alot
to
compete
with
pours
a
nice
golden
with
one
finger
head
sweet
smell
of
malt
nice
light
taste
and
great
balance
slighty
boozey
not
too
malty
with
just
the
right
amount
of
hop
creamy
mouthfeel
i
would
not
mind
having
a
whole
sixpack
of
these
one
of
the
better
pilsners
i
have
had
this
beer
a
couple
different
times
and
this
was
not
up
to
par
with
the
other
samplings
however
i
am
trying
to
grade
on
the
collective
experience
i
like
this
beer
and
when
fresh
reminds
me
alot
of
some
of
the
better
euro
pilsner
offerings
d
i
am
not
a
pilsner
drinker
but
this
is
probably
the
closest
to
actual
taste
in
this
category
of
brewing
well
balanced
and
close
to
perfect
for
this
style
mouthfeel
is
rich
thick
luscious
and
even
crisp
clean
making
this
another
very
drinkable
and
notable
brew
from
clipper
city
as
it
goes
down
to
the
end
of
the
bottle
it
seems
sweeter
though
not
in
an
overly
sugary
way
interesting
for
sure
i
would
like
to
have
something
very
salty
with
this
the
whole
heavy
seas
line
is
pretty
solid
i
have
yet
to
try
one
i
dont
like
d
could
fatigue
after
4
or
5
but
overall
very
smooth
and
well
balanced
an
interesting
beer
which
comes
off
to
me
anyway
was
sort
of
a
cross
between
an
ipa
and
an
esb
this
concept
of
the
über
pils
intrigues
me
as
for
the
beer
itself
its
a
very
rewarding
brew
and
i
would
definitely
purchase
this
again
im
not
quite
sure
what
to
make
of
this
it
doesnt
seem
like
either
a
pilsener
or
imperial
pilsener
its
still
drinkable
but
again
im
not
too
impressed
i
would
prefer
that
it
stress
the
flavor
of
the
pilsener
malt
more
but
it
doesnt
appear
to
do
this
a
good
pilsener
even
an
imperial
pilsener
should
be
tasty
this
is
just
a
bit
too
boozy
for
me
pours
a
bright
orangy
golden
with
a
small
white
head
that
falls
fairly
quickly
the
aroma
is
malty
with
a
tight
hop
character
a
little
earthy
a
little
citrusy
with
a
sharp
pine
note
that
gives
it
a
pinched
slightly
sour
edge
the
flavor
has
that
same
piny
sourness
not
entirely
unpleasant
but
not
terribly
subtle
or
refreshing
either
there
is
a
faint
slap
of
alcohol
that
is
unbecoming
in
a
pilsner
the
mouthfeel
is
surprisingly
viscous
leaving
that
sour
note
clinging
to
the
tongue
this
is
not
a
beer
id
be
happy
to
spend
much
time
with
feel
is
good
body
wise
and
carbonation
wise
but
the
drinkability
is
low
due
to
the
one
dimension
of
it
drinkability
well
it
is
easy
to
drink
despite
the
high
abv
but
thats
largely
because
theres
not
much
to
it
i
doubt
id
seek
it
out
again
simply
because
theres
not
much
to
it
but
itd
be
way
too
easy
to
put
down
a
few
of
these
d
very
smooth
and
refreshing
this
beer
is
a
wonderful
example
of
a
foodcompatible
beverage
that
can
stand
up
to
heavy
flavors
it
was
not
hard
to
accidentally
drink
all
three
of
these
that
i
got
in
the
sample
pack
in
a
few
hours
thinnish
cream
white
head
lacing
sticks
around
longer
than
the
head
does
quite
cloudy
adds
to
glow
of
the
bronze
orange
color
only
slight
yellowing
at
the
rims
smells
like
a
pilsner
that
ate
three
cheesecakes
and
got
so
fat
it
couldnt
get
off
the
couch
without
two
guys
helping
supersweet
pink
grapefruit
and
orange
juice
golden
honey
dates
if
not
outright
plummy
at
moments
touches
of
coriander
and
cumin
spice
ripe
peach
and
apricot
fruit
streaks
of
grassy
grainy
hops
without
ever
becoming
more
than
an
embellishment
medium
to
fullbodied
very
round
and
dense
in
mouth
feel
without
at
the
same
time
feeling
soft
presents
all
that
ripe
juicy
apricot
peach
cherry
fruit
as
well
as
pink
grapefruit
tangelo
citrus
thin
glaze
of
honey
keeps
you
smiling
and
just
wanting
to
uncritically
throw
more
back
the
carbonation
level
is
perfect
tiny
pricks
alone
allowing
the
flavors
to
soak
in
fully
the
only
drawback
here
may
be
that
it
doesnt
taste
like
a
pilsner
my
first
double
pilsner
so
maybe
im
ignorant
maybe
pours
out
a
deep
golden
color
with
smaller
white
head
constant
carbonation
makes
this
beer
very
attractive
good
looking
brew
smells
really
hoppy
for
a
pilsner
with
some
citrus
in
there
not
too
much
nose
taste
is
really
interesting
very
hoppy
with
a
nice
spiciness
and
almost
sweetness
on
the
finish
clean
this
one
up
really
nicely
some
orange
that
blends
well
with
the
spices
very
nice
hoppy
pils
with
a
bitterness
that
makes
it
fairly
drinkable
nothing
too
amazing
that
blows
you
away
but
a
very
nice
solid
brew
golden
copper
hazed
by
fine
suspended
particles
big
patchy
white
head
that
leaves
big
blobs
of
lace
on
the
glass
smell
is
faint
amarillo
hops
and
fruity
yeast
tastes
pretty
unique
not
a
hop
bomb
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
but
just
enough
of
a
hop
kick
to
get
the
juices
flowing
nice
chewy
maltiness
finishes
it
off
smooth
medium
heavy
mouthfeel
with
a
very
fine
carbonation
cool
and
different
beer
thats
worth
checking
out
d
a
decent
big
beer
that
is
not
overpowering
probably
couldnt
knock
down
a
couple
in
a
sitting
but
as
a
single
bottle
it
was
good
notes
i
wrote
tastes
like
a
pilsner
with
too
much
fruity
malt
or
yeast
and
concluded
too
sweet
not
a
horrible
beer
but
i
like
my
pilsners
even
imperial
pilsners
to
be
more
crisp
dry
and
with
the
hop
bite
or
bitterness
dominating
any
grainy
or
yeasty
foundation
this
one
didnt
live
up
to
those
expectations
drinkablitity
is
good
high
alcohol
content
that
isnt
all
that
prevalent
is
the
only
thing
keeping
it
from
a
5
in
my
book
notes
from
81305
an
imperial
pilsner
hmmm
pours
a
deep
gold
with
an
ice
cream
cone
head
lots
of
sticky
lacing
on
the

with
a
slow

of
tiny
bubbles
smell
of
wet
hay
sour
and
musty
also
corn
and
grains
onthenose
taste
of

hops

some

easy
drinker
this
is
a
very
interesting
beer
i
could
definately
have
a
few
of
these
hv
overall
an
enjoyable
beer
though
a
style
i
dont
particularly
enjoy
d
the
pils
is
not
my
style
of
beer
but
this
is
a
decent
brew
from
clipper
city
pours
a
clear
golden
yellow
color
with
a
thin
foamy
white
head
that
settles
into
a
slight
lacing
crisp
light
fruit
aroma
with
hints
of
apple
pear
citrus
peel
as
well
as
subtle
malt
and
hop
presence
very
quaffable
with
a
slight
malt
character
balancing
out
the
citrus
grapefruit
lemon
and
banana
flavors
and
a
perfect
citrus
hop
finish
dark
in
color
for
a
pilsner
but
light
for
an
american
double
a
clear
light
amber
with
a
white
multisized
bubbles
head
that
didnt
stick
around
long
but
leaves
a
nice
ring
of
foam
for
the
rest
of
this
session
smells
of
typical
noble
pilsner
hops
along
with
a
mild
bisuit
pale
malt
and
maybe
some
other
hoppiness
that
i
cant
place
this
is
a
very
good
souped
up
pilsner
im
not
generally
a
big
fan
of
the
traditional
pilsner
style
but
the
extra
hop
and
malt
characteristics
and
a
meatier
medfull
bodied
mouthfeel
and
warming
alcohol
are
much
tastier
and
more
interesting
for
me
another
solid
release
from
clipper
citys
heavy
seas
line
out
of
a
bottle
this
beer
was
a
deep
gold
color
with
some
tangerine
tint
to
it
the
head
was
two
fingers
of
small
yellowish
bubbles
that
slowly
receded
to
a
thin
skim
nice
lacing
the
aroma
was
a
good
blend
of
floral
and
citrus
hops
with
pilsner
malt
and
a
generally
dry
grainy
character
the
flavors
were
complex
and
impressive
at
first
there
was
a
shot
of
sweet
caramel
malt
and
toffee
followed
by
the
rich
grainy
character
followed
by
bready
yeast
and
a
bitter
finish
elements
of
fruit
persist
throughout
and
yet
the
character
remains
dry
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
the
body
rich
and
full
though
not
heavy
perfect
carbonation
too
impressive
and
enjoyable
a
great
example
of
an
imperial
pilsner
nikki
d
a
good
pils
with
some
kick
flavor
has
a
slight
malt
sweetness
and
a
bold
but
not
overwhelming
hop
presence
mouthfeel
is
fullbodied
and
the
finish
is
all
noble
hops
seems
to
fit
the
bill
perfectly
of
an
imperial
pilsner
meeting
all
the
characteristics
of
a
pilsner
but
doubly
so
with
a
fuller
body
and
a
stronger
hop
presence
the
bright
fresh
presence
of
citrusy
hops
seems
a
bit
offstyle
but
is
a
nice
addition
pretty
good
beer
this
stuff
was
pretty
damn
good
for
being
an
old
bottle
i
would
love
to
get
a
fresher
one
and
get
the
full
hop
effect
really
a
nice
beer
d
pretty
drinkable
beer
but
may
be
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
liking
d
this
one
has
great
balance
and
nice
mouthfeel
with
considerable
complexity
its
nothing
special
to
look
at
but
its
very
good
and
something
i
could
drink
several
of
i
thought
this
was
one
of
the
better
ones
in
the
mixed
pack
a
solid
beer
of
a
rare
style
pours
a
cloudy
copper
color
with
a
small
head
there
is
almost
no
aroma
to
speak
of
which
i
found
quite
odd
taste
wise
is
much
better
than
small
you
get
a
nice
mix
of
malts
ans
hops
with
a
nice
smooth
finish
theres
a
bit
of
alcohol
kick
in
the
swallow
but
thats
expected
and
flows
with
the
beer
try
this
if
you
can
d
good
beer
but
there
is
something
there
that
seems
out
of
place
drinking
this
impy
pilsner
from
clipper
city
was
a
joy
a
must
try
if
you
get
the
chance
d
a
good
imperial
pils
not
my
favorite
but
i
would
consider
doing
again
the
flavor
matches
the
nose
this
is
far
more
malty
than
most
pilsner
very
rich
pilsner
that
the
carbonation
balances
off
nicely
all
around
i
say
good
beer
for
a
cool
fall
weekend
you
must
try
this
beer
overall
very
enjoyable
the
entire
heavy
seas
bunch
was
worth
taking
a
look
at
no
gold
medals
but
very
well
done
another
good
clipper
city
beer
prosit
mk
a
quality
drinkable
pilsner
granted
i
am
not
normally
a
big
pilsner
fan
but
this
one
lacks
some
of
that
crisp
bitterness
of
other
pilsners
which
is
a
good
thing
a
nice
golden
color
from
pour
with
apparent
carbonization
a
very
slight
hop
smell
nothing
too
big
though
a
nice
hop
flavor
nothing
overwhelming
not
too
bitter
a
crisp
pilsner
and
feels
that
way
in
your
mouth
in
the
end
a
refreshing
take
on
the
pilsner
and
one
i
could
drink
a
few
of
admittedly
pilseners
dont
usually
do
it
for
me
but
this
is
very
good
maybe
a
little
too
heavy
with
warmth
but
wellmade
and
enjoyable
for
1
or
2
nonetheless

d
this
is
definitely
a

that
i
could

for
hours
it
leaves
a
clean
feeling
and
no
one
flavor
dominates
d
very
smooth
tasting
beer
da
good
beer
but
slanted
too
malt
forward
for
my
taste
i
can
see
the
good
in
this
but
for
me
it
simply
doesnt
have
what
i
am
looking
for
aside
from
the
alcohol
content
quite
drinkable
surprisingly
mild
fairly
well
constructed
brew
but
nothing
to
shout
about
d
very
nice
example
of
the
style
while
i
do
not
have
a
lot
of
experience
with
this
style
i
found
it
enjoyable
and
in
line
with
other
things
i
have
tried
the
best
beer
from
this
brewery
i
have
had
to
date
the
more
i
have
this
the
more
i
like
it
when
i
first
purchased
it
i
did
not
know
it
was
an
imperial
pils
pours
a
golden
color
perhaps
darker
shade
of
gold
topped
with
a
nice
thick
creamy
head
that
leaves
a
lot
of
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
is
hoppy
with
lemons
some
malts
and
a
faint
overall
tang
presence
slightly
bitter

flavor
with
sweet
citrus

balanced
by
rich
malts
crisp
clean
creamy
and
a
great

balance
slightly
sour
tart

aftertaste
i
can
find
this
easily
it
is
bold
and
flavorful
while
being
refreshing
and
it
is
reasonably
priced
upon
first
sips
floral
hops
and
some
bitterness
then
mild
sweetness
that
balances
well
very
nice
i
didnt
think
i
would
enjoy
a
pils
this
much
not
much
in

aftertaste
tho
light

really

lots
of

that
fades
into
a

feel
texture
with
a
little
alcohol
heat
on
the
finish
its
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
some
bright
carbonation
not
many
breweries
are
doing
this
style
maybe
because
it
is
my
first
of
its
kind
hits
the
mouth
with
an
almost
gritty
spice
to
it
and
finishes
with
a
little
bit
of
mineral
astringency
a
slick
oil
feeling
so
it
tastes
a
little
yeasty
caramel
and
bready
the
taste
is
almost
sweet
with
just
a
little
bit
of
bitterness
from
the
hops
sneaking
in
at
the
end
of
the
sip
the
sweetness
is
like
a

definitely
try

its
going

to

watch
out
though

the

especially
with

better
the

it

despite

imperialization

the

imperial

this
is
one
of
the
better
u
s
efforts
at
a
pils
that
ive
come
across
nice
clean
with
a
nod
towards
modernity
like
it
more
than
i
expected
too
this
is
a
very
good
beer
the
body
might
slip
into
the
medium
range
but
doesnt
get
too
heavy
dryness
cuts
in
partway
through
to
finish
it
out
crispness
is
firm
and
stays
all
the
way
through
the
only
issue
is
that
it
could
be
a
little
cleaner
at
the
end
of
the
sip
overall
a
very
good
imperial
pilsner
not
a
strong
focus
on
the
hops
but
strong
i
like
it
im
really
not
often
a
fan
of
pilsners
because
i
often
find
them
bland
and
uninteresting
but
i
enjoy
the
body
and
sweetness
of
the
curl
quite
a
lot
o
this
was
okay
the
toasted
flavor
i
didnt
care
for
and
made
this
a
pretty
off
balanced
beer
the
backend
and
aftertaste
i
found
quite
enjoyable
just
wish
it
was
the
same
throughout
o
decent
pilsner
well
balanced
and
easy
to
drink
o
this
double
pils
was
a
nice
diversion
from
the
norm
this
is
a
unique
brew
and
i
would
definitely
try
it

it

overall
i
get
how
this
is
a
pilsner
but
almost
comes
off
like
a
saison
to
me
drink
i
really
enjoyed
this
the
balance
was
there
with
a
good
thick
malt
balance
with
a
bit
of
spicy
lemon
and
hops
a
little
bitter
but
works
overall
d
really
good
double
pilsner
here
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
one
the
amarillo
hops
were
bold
enough
to
provide
a
really
nice
balance
to
the
grain
malts
i
love
this
hop
and
was
glad
to
see
it
in
this
beer

the
best

have
tried

stuff
ive
not
heard
of
an
imperial
pilsner
but
as
the
name
implies
i
expected
a
classic
pilsner
but
with
additional
malt
and
hops
i
was
not
disappointed
the
aroma
and
taste
matched
each
other
sweet
bready
malt
and
noble
hops
overall
this
beer
reminded
me
more
of
a
full
flavored
german
pilsner
rather
than
an
american
pils
o
very
nice
imperial
pilsner
more
bitter
than
i
was
expecting
but
crisp
and
delicious
overall
not
bad
brings
more
american
style
than
german
a
bit
heavy
nice
malts
at
first
until
the
caramel
sweet
malts
kick
in
a
bit
too
much
and
the
hops
were
nice
at
first
then
turned
quite
bitter
and
astringent
and
overpower
the
rest
of
the
beer
o
a
very
nice
drinking
beer
crisp
and
refreshing
decently
bitter
yet
just
sweet
enough
no
alcohol
bite
yet
it
warms
you
up
nicely

like
its
a
pils
fighting
to
be
an
ipa

a
little
excessive

this
wasnt

but
unfortunately
its
pretty
damn
far
from
the
stalwart

pungent
sums
this
one
up
it
really
delivers
on
the
imperial
pilsner
name
a
touch
boozy
and
intense
for
my
liking
and
a
bit
muddled
and
messy
on
the
whole
but
its
interesting
definitely
drinkable
and
enjoyable
not
a
bad
beer
glad
i
tried
it

aroma
immediately
is
a

boozy

and
a
really
nice
and
well
laid

background
quite
nicely
done
i
have
to
admit
this
beer
pours
a
very
bright
and
vibrant
clean
gold
in
color
with
good
clarity
and
a
two

sudsy

finish
its
a
lot
more
bitter
than
i
anticipated
it
also
dries
out
my
palate
its
a
solid
beer
but
like
most
pilsners
theres
little
variance
from
the
norm
it
drinks
well
and
is
very
drinkable
but
it
is
what
it
is
o
d
i
guess
this
is
ok
some
interesting
things
here
but
i
wont
have
it
again

this
is

from
the

heavy
overly
bready
and
yeasty
and
far
from
clean
not
refreshing
at
all
and
otherwise
not
satisfying
o
this
beer
kicked
my
ass
which
i
told
andrew
betsona
when
we
were
drinking
it
the
malts
were
a
little
over
the
top
at
times
but
nicely
done
the
style
itself
was
a
little
messy
at
times
but
then
again
i
never
realized
why
a
lot
of
brewers
are
doing
this
as
a
style
not
a
typical
shorts
beer
and
therefore
i
dont
know
how
i
really
feel
about
it
admittedly
this
is
not
my
favorite
style
but
this
one
is
very
easy
to
appreciate
the
complex
flavors
and
easy
drinkability
make
this
offering
another
shorts
masterpiece
d
i
feel
like
one
bottle
is
enough
its
not
bad
but
there
is
just
something
that
i
find
tiring
after
awhile

ranks

be

again
thanks
tom
for

and
a

id
have
this
again
o
i
liked
this
beer
well
enough

there
were
a

did
just
enough
to
put

this

i
will
buy
more
than
one
6
pack
spring
is
a
perfect
time
of
year
for
this
beer
after
a
season
of
drinking
dark
heavies
this
is
very
welcome
i
wonder
if
this
is
the
base
beer
for
the
spruce
pilsner
i
wasnt
expecting
much
and
this
exceeded
what
i
had
hoped
for
no
problem
downing
these
on
a
hot
day
while
playing
18
holes
given
the
abv
i
may
end
up
face
down
by
the
9th
but
hell
id
give
it
a
go
untill
now
i
have
yet
to
drink
a
shorts
and
go
wow
the
pour
is
a
light
golden
with
a
crisp
white
head
aroma
is
bready
and
yeasty
with
a
hint
of
floral
hop
as
i
ake
the
first
sip
i
am
a
bit
taken
aback
by
the
amount
of
hop
that
hits
my
tounge
this
is
a
bitter
beer
lots
of
citrus
sweet
grapefruit
rind
flavor
this
is
almost
balenced
out
by
the
sweet
malt
and
bready
flavors
but
not
quite
drinks
easy
with
plenty
of
small
bubbles
to
keep
me
from
chugging
it
i
would
seek
this
out
given
the
opertunity
herbal
minty
hop
bitterness
up
front
along
with
some
sweetish
soapy
soft
cookie
malt
hop
bitterness
crescendos
with
notes
of
resin
sea
air
and
mint
its
rather
dank
and
also
rather
delicious
honey
and
melon
settle
in
beneath
but
the
finish
is
dominated
by
the
funky
stinky
hops
dry
and
very
appetizing
finish
mediumfull
body
with
a
soft
creamy
feel
one
of
the
best
imperial
pilsners
around
overall
this
was
a
very
good
imperial
pilsner
the
best
i
have
had
so
far
this
beer
was
basically
everything
a
good
pilsner
should
be
but
double
that
the
look
and
drinkability
of
this
beer
was
fantastic
this
is
something
i
could
enjoy
during
the
summer
while
playing
some
disc
golf
all
in
all
this
was
a
crisp
clean
easy
drinking
beer
that
i
enjoyed
a
lot
and
it
gave
me
a
new
appreciation
for
this
style
i
wish
there
were
more
imperial
pilsners
on
the
market
if
you
like
the
drinkability
of
pilsners
and
the
flavor
of
pale
ales
then
give
this
beer
a
try
it
has
a
great
combination
of
flavor
and
drinkability
overall
for
being
a
hophead
this
brew
rocks
i
feel
this
could
be
the
future
of
american
genius
different
in
a
good
way
but
strong
and
assertive
one
of
the
most
profound
examples
of
what
shorts
is
capable
of
still
this
one
seems
a
bit
on
the
bleeding
edge
overall
good
nothing
id
go
out
of
my
way
too
much
for
but
its
on
par
for
the
style
kind
of
expected
a
bit
more
hop
flavoraroma
cheers
o
a
wonderful
beer
its
a
very
easy
drinker
and
seems
to
really
fit
the
style
guidelines
mentioned
on
this
site
im
very
happy
this
beer
is
back
i
can
see
it
being
a
great
backyard
bbq
beer
when
you
want
something
with
a
little
kick
this
is
a
home
run
beer
clean
clear
slightly
bitterhopped
and
aromatic
the
curl
has
a
crisp
feel
and
is
wellbalanced
good
drinkability
even
with
its
high
abv
overall
just
not
one
of
my
styles
i
enjoy
it
more
as
i
drink
it
i
think
the
hops
are
taking
over
but
my
palate
is
hypersensitive
to
pilsner
malts
and
or
lagers
in
general
overall
a
good
beer
definitely
finishable
better
than
lion
stouts
offering
in
this
same
category
by
a
longshot
o
i
was
a
little
leery
of
this
one
because
of
my
lack
of
experience
with
the
style
and
my
overall
opinion
of
the
brewery
despite
these
factors
i
was
surprisingly
impressed
by
this
beer
this
beer
takes
the
style
that
most
beer
drinkers
started
with
and
makes
it
something
they
can
now
be
proud
of
nice
work

12
ounce
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
this
is
a
clear
pale
golden
color
fizzy
with
around
half
an
inch
of
head
smell
is
soapy
with
lots
of
cereals
and
light
hoppiness
taste
is
dominated
by
a
crisp
hoppiness
but
it
is
balanced
well
enough
to
not
be
overly
bitter
light
white
grape
flavors
are
present
as
well
delicious
with
excellent
drinkability
had
this
on
tap
at
the
hopcat
i
wonder
what
the
age
has
done
with
it
seeing
as
the
last
review
before
mine
was
over
8
months
ago
md
super
smooth
refreshing
and
drinkable
the
best
pilsner
ive
had
props
to
joe
short
on
this
brew
d
very
drinkable
no
hint
of
alcohol
really
and
tons
of
citrusy
hop
character
make
this
an
excellent
drinker
definitely
a
recommendation
on
tap
at
mi

lots
of
citric

in

some

just
a
little
bit
of
candy
to
follow
flavours
are
massive

good

dry
lingering
bitter

good
i
liked
this
brweies
tent
dwell
done
again
wasnt
too
hopefull
considering
the
age
on
this
one
but
it
came
through
strong
this
has
aged
ridiculously
well
given
that
this
bottle
is
almost
three
years
old
i
would
be
curious
to
know
what
it
was
like
fresh
very
tasty
and
much
too
drinkable
a
scary
combination
a
must
try
if
you
can
find
it
from
shorts
brewing
of
bellaire
mi
notes
from
71108
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
pretty
tasty
brew
hate
to
sound
like
a
broken
record
but
i
wish
that
bit
of
over
carbonation
wasnt
there
it
doesnt
affect
the
mouthfeel
as
much
as
the
taste
but
overall
i
guess
its
not
that
bad
it
gets
better
as
the
bottle
empties
really
wish
i
could
try
this
fresh
but
i
did
enjoy
tremendously
big
thanks
again
to
jon
one
of
the
better
imperial
pilsners
i
have
had
cannot
believe
that
it
has
not
changed
much
since
it
was
fresh
still
nice
and
hoppy
like
it
was
brewed
yesterday
real
dry
for
its
age
which
was
not
a
bad
thing
even
smells
really
fresh
still
would
drink
again
but
probably
not
for
eighteen
dollars
a
bottle
recommended
it
is
bottle
conditioned
and
you
can
definitely
tell
with
how
well
this
tastes
at
this
point
in
time
keep
on
rawkin
joe
d
glad
i
had
the
experience
of
trying
this
great
limited
beer
it
was
an
experience
overall
wow
a
lot
of
hops
here
even
after
a
year
its
still
held
up
great
in
fact
its
better
than
when
i
tried
it
a
year
ago
very
bitter
super
pilsner
good
stuff
taste
light
a
very
light
bodied
ipa
on
with
the
review
nice
pilsen
malt
leads
a
full
mouthfeel
and
dry
mid
palate
that
is
encoutered
with
the
dry
hoppiness
of
the
amarillos
that
leave
a
good
minute
finish
for
you
too
digest
hints
of
apricot
peach
and
lemon
fill
out
this
complex
pilsner
probably
the
best
pils
ive
tried
to
date
only
wish
it
were
more
available
the
mouth
starts
off
moderate
but
turns
too
dry
and
bitter
for
me
i
wont
be
dropping
another
16
for
this
one
pours
a
deep
gold
with
a
smallish
white
head
on
the
first
pour
closer
to
the
end
the
yeastiness
mixes
in
and
gives
it
a
paler
color
and
is
nice
and
cloudy
there
is
a
decent
size
grassy
hop
aroma
along
with
some
sweet
sugariness
and
a
sweet
grainy
aroma
there
is
also
a
nice
pepperiness
in
the
finish
at
the
start
of
the
tasting
although
this
ended
up
mellowing
towards
the
end
there
is
a
little
lemon
and
grapefruit
that
develop
further
in
in
both
aroma
and
taste
as
it
warms
a
very
nice
balance
between
the
pepperyness
and
dryness
from
the
hops
with
the
medium
body
i
may
not
pay
15
99
again
for
this
but
it
is
definitely
a
tasty
imp
pils
and
i
am
glad
to
see
some
shorts
stuff
in
bottles
making
its
way
south
this
is
the
perfect
hothumid
but
not
sunny
weather
beer
refreshing
and
flavorful
at
the
same
time
as
far
as
double
pilsners
go
i
liked
the
sam
adams
better
but
this
beat
out
the
dfh
offering
pricy
but
its
worth
it
if
your
a
true
beer
geek
md
thick
body
with
a
dextrinous
quality
medium
carbonation
i
must
say
the
lacing
on
this
beer
was
the
most
incredible
ive
ever
seen
too
bad
the
beer
was
so
cloudy
this
beer
is
reviewed
to
style
which
the
ba
description
says
should
be
much
more
malty
than
i
found
the
beer
to
actually
be
honestly
i
found
the
beer
to
be
too
hoppy
and
dry
but
just
as
i
finished
thinking
about
how
dry
my
most
recent
sip
was
i
was
wishing
for
another
sip
pours
a
light
orange
color
with
yellow
highlights
slightly
hazy
half
inch
thick
bright
white
head
forms
but
fades
quickly
very
little
lacing
is
left
behind
very
citrusy
and
lemony
smell
nice
definitely
can
smell
the
hops
and
malts
seem
to
take
a
backseat
to
the
hops
somewhat
floral
with
hints
of
spices
kinda
weak
tasting
nothing
really
stands
up
and
grabs
you
malt
and
hops
are
well
balanced
with
some
citrusy
fruit
flavors
hanging
in
the
back
a
little
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
a
tad
thin
for
me
slightly
watery
lots
of
carbonation
but
its
not
felt
in
the
mouth
i
can
hardly
believe
this
7
1
very
easy
too
drink
i
must
say
that
i
like
this
more
than
dogfish
heads
golden
shower
this
seems
almost
like
an
apa
to
me
anyway
it
would
really
be
hard
for
me
to
shell
out
another
15
99
for
another
bottle
2
955
if
its
just
like
sucking
on
a
pine
cone
past
its
prime
how
good
will
it
be
fresh
number
2
of
the
evening
golden
glow
fluffy
white

the
smell
is
northern
michigan
i
want
to
marry
it
taste
is
smooth
and
silky
a
little
bite
of
sprucehop
not
something
to
drink
a
six
of
but
a
nice
slow
sipper
on
a
hot
day
me
likey
love
the
idea
here
playing
heavy
spruce
pine
flavor
and
aroma
with
a
very
aggressive
hopping
surprised
by
the
color
has
an
almost
brown
hue
to
the
pale
beer
not
yellow
at
all
big
frothy
head
and
a
great
aroma
that
smells
like
cutting
down
a
christmas
tree
fresh
spruce
really
springy
and
nice
maybe
as
much
spruce
as
ive
ever
seen
in
a
beer
the
hops
go
with
it
so
well
bitter
and
leafy
and
balancing
well
malt
is
not
normal
pils
malt
to
me
here
its
not
crackery
and
thin
but
instead
a
little
richer
huge
in
body
and
quite
flavorful
even
a
touch
of
dry
smoke
it
seems
the
spruce
is
so
intense
when
it
comes
on
so
fresh
i
love
how
flavorful
this
is
and
the
curious
malt
base
seems
to
fit
it
very
well
nice
bog
body
effervescent
carbonation
and
not
a
trace
of
booze
on
it
at
all
there
is
an
almost
menthol
herbal
intensity
to
it
in
the
throat
eucalyptus
or
something
real
strange
but
not
unappealing
woody
and
wintery
i
absolutely
love
how
different
this
is
top
notch
stuff
from
a
brewery
who
had
really
yet
to
impress
me
this
is
astoundingly
delicious
this
one
is
too
heavyhanded
to
be
taken
all
that
seriously
i
like
the
flavor
of
spruce
but
its
overused
here
like
drinking
a
christmas
tree
very
tasty
very
strong
pine
taste
which
i
like
yards
brewery
makes
a
spruce
amber
which
is
also
good
but
tame
in
comparison
a
good
beer
to
share
if
your
friends
have
an
open
mind
and
a
broad
palate
no
mistaking
the
spruce
tips
here
very
piney
my
fourth
beer
from
shorts
and
all
have
been
unique
so
far
so
good
keeping
this
short
and
sweet
best
beer
ive
ever
tasted
so
far
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
but
i
doubt
i
could
have
more
than
a
bottle
of
it
that
pine
note
is
super
intense
regardless
pick
this
one
up
without
a
second
thought
assuming
you
dont
hate
the
smell
or
taste
of
pine
o
this
is
a
really
good
offering
from
shorts
well
balanced
with
lots
of
great
piney
flavors
overall
i
usually
grab
a
couple
of
sixers
of
this
one
to
get
me
through
the
year
i
would
highly
recommend
cracking
open
a
bottle
with
some
indian
food
o
this
stuff
is
great
and
traditionally
shorts
i
can
really
imagine
sitting
among
the
pine
tree
in
northern
michigan
and
knocking
back
a
few
of
these
overall
excellent
spruce
flavor
wish
it
had
been
carbonated
well
done
shorts
a
great
brew
not
experimental
but
well
thought
out
and
executed
thanks
abanton
for
the
hookup
glad
i
finally
got
around
to
this
one
held
up
well
too
bright
clean
crisp
and
delicious
a
definite
standout
reviewed
3208
o
the
only
shorts
beer
to
date
i
havent
enjoyed
the
huge
herbal
spruce
flavor
just
doesnt
work
for
me
as
only
the
tiniest
amount
of
hop
flavor
attempts
to
balance
it
not
my
thing
unfortunately
mediumthick
bodied
with
a
largely
oily
resinous
and
almost
sticky
mouth
feel
with
medium
carbonation
a
harshly
bitter
finish
that
could
wake
up
a
corpse
jesus
this
stuff
is
pretty
damn
intense
its
a
very
polarizing
brew
and
now
i
can
see
why
i
understand
why
some
people
may
dig
this
stuff
me
i
thought
it
was
alright
but
nothing
to
rave
about
hard
to
drink
in
quantity
overall
not
as
unique
as
other
shorts
beers
but
executed
just
as
well
as
any
delicious
bitter
and
sweet
balance
another
shorts
beer
i
was
disappointed
to
miss
in
bottle
only
to
find
on
tap
overall
another
crossbreed
of
a
beer
shorts
never
disappoints
with
their
experimental
creations
reminds
me
a
lot
like
beard
of
zeus
from
two
months
ago
but
with
a
lot
more
pine
presence
and
its
a
little
thickermore
syrupy
glad
i
got
my
hands
on
a
sixer
will
be
going
to
pick
up
some
more
while
its
still
available
this
may
be
one
of
my
all
time
favorites
from
shorts
right
up
there
with
huma
lupa
overall
a
very
unique
beer
it
wants
to
be
that
beer
that
reminds
me
of
walking
and
chewing
on
the
forest
spruce
lined
sap
and
soil
covered
earth
however
they
seem
to
have
added
extra
earthy
spicy
chewy
hops
on
top
of
it
which
was
not
needed
and
brings
it
down
it
is
bitter
and
astringent
earthy
soil
flavored
and
malts
and
yeast
at
least
bring
nice
belgian
blond
flavors
esters
and
hint
of
phenols
even
which
accent
the
spruce
nicely
this
poured
out
as
a
slightly
hazy
yellow
color
the
head
was
white
the
retention
fades
and
doesnt
leave
much
lacing
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
spruce
big
time
herbal
spruce
aromas
very
pungent
the
taste
is
also
very
much
full
of
spruce
but
its
also
nicely
balanced
the
spruce
is
huge
upfront
then
settles
into
a
nice
dry
bitterness
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
clean
and
crisp
very
drinkable
overall
pretty
damn
impressive
its
got
a
ton
of
spruce
flavors
so
if
youre
up
for
it
give
it
a
try
very
nice
brew
pour
is
a
pale
yellow
hazed
with
a
thin
bubbly

head
nose
is

and
lingering
on

tongue
ive
been
a
shorts
fan
for
a
while
but
this
might
be
one
of
my
alltime
favorites
this
completely
demolishes
nearly
every
other
beer
in
the
genre
while
completely
nailing
the
described
intention
from
the
label
i
want
more
of
this
immediately
o
an
excellent
and
uniquely
flavorful
pilsner
i
can
really
say
i
would
drink
this
all
the
time
if
i
lived
in
michigan
still
o
pine
allover
the
place
some
lemonysoap
in
the
finish
pours
with
about
a
fingers
worth
of
head
and
leaves
a
lacing
after
every
sip
smell
is
of
pure
spruce
treesneedles
i
also
get
a
some
hops
on
the
smell
very
good
smelling
taste
is
very
similar
to
the
smell
for
me
it
is
a
little
to
over
bearing
on
the
spruce
almost
like
im
drinking
a
tree
but
i
totally
appreciate
what
they
are
going
for
with
this
one
mouthful
is
nice
with
a
moderate
about
of
carbonation
and
little
hop
bite
on
the
end
overall
this
is
a
solid
beer
from
shorts
and
one
i
would
welcome
having
again
o
unique
again
very
refreshing

perfect

great

extremely
easy
to

highly
enjoyable
what
can
i
say
but
wow
i
loved
this
beer
last
year
but
thought
maybe
it
was
just
because
of
the
circumstances
of
when
i
tried
it
well
this
year
i
bought
a
six
pack
and
needless
to
say
had
to
go
back
and
buy
12
more
this
has
to
be
one
of
the
most
unique
beers
ive
ever
had
the
smell
of
spruce
works
so
well
with
the
ipa
and
the
flavor
is
just
exceptional
this
is
a
beer
i
hope
to
stockpile
a
bit
more
of
as
last
year
it
really
lasted
a
long
time
and
still
tasted
good
mouthfeel
is
ver
fresh
light
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
and
a
little
oiliness
from
the
hops
definitely
a
beer
i
would
get
again
o
this
is
a
great
example
of
what
an
imperial
pilsner
can
be
i
really
enjoyed
it
and
would
get
a
growler
of
it
if
it
were
down
at
my
shop
d
very
drinkable
the
strong
spruce
flavor
works
really
nicely
alongside
the
strong
hop
flavors
great
hoppy
pilsner
o
while
i
wasnt
a
huge
fan
of
the
spruce
pilsner
in
bottles
for
2011
i
really
enjoyed
the
imperial
version
on
draught
the
flavors
and
spruce
tips
meshed
a
lot
better
and
eliminated
the
harsh
aftertaste
overall
after
a
few
disappointments
this
is
a
beer
that
kind
of
brought
me
back
to
shorts
if
you
dig
bitter
hops
and
like
the
smelltaste
of
pine
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
cant
wait
till
next
years
batch
for
more
tasty
hazy
pale
blonde
colour
one
finger
of
white
head
good
lace
smell
is
of
sprunce
and
pine
quite
hoppy
citrus
fruit
in
there
biscuity
malt
backbone
lots
of
hops
in
here
though
taste
has
a
sprucey
forest
note
citrus
following
fruity
flavours
grapefruit
and
pine
good
amount
of
maqlt
in
the
finish
nice
bitterness
with
a
light
alcohol
aftertaste
medium
carbonation
medium
body
resinious
and
oily
good
feel
solid
stuff
flavourful
stuff
very
drinkable
overall
a
very
very
interesting
beer
i
have
never
had
anything
like
it
hard
to
drink
a
whole
pint
but
enjoyable
in
small
amounts
the
flavor
is
intriguing
to
me
it
tastes
as
you
might
expect
with
some
bitterness
present
from
the
hops
with
slight
citrus
edge
but
mild
in
relation
to
the
deep
woody
and
almost
tannic
sharp
acidic
and
earthy
pinelike
taste
that
comes
forward
in
the
peripheral
and
lasts
into
the
finish
with
only
a
mild
amount
of
pilsner
malt
light
cracker
elements
overall
i
found
this
to
live
up
to
the
name
it
was
woody
but
not
so
astringent
that
it
was
undrinkable
i
found
the
feel
to
be
not
very
pilsnerlike
but
that
really
isnt
the
point
of
this
the
spruce
is
conveyed
in
the
taste
more
than
any
other
spiced
or
other
flavored
beer
and
still
compliments
the
base
beer
very
well
o
just
way
too
much
spruce
flavor
for
me
shorts
brewing
company
has
a
knack
for
blazing
trails
spruce
pilsner
is
definitely
a
unique
trailblazing
beer
how
is
it
good
personally
the
spruce
aspect
seems
a
tad
old
by
the
end
of
the
bottle
but
it
does
work
well
with
the
pilsner
malt
and
strong
hop
flavors
definitely
worth
checking
out
if
you
have
the
opportunity
overall
way
too
bitter
in
the
finish
killing
all
the
other
flavors
otherwise
i
thought
this
beer
was
quite
nice
and
very
interesting
for
all
their
oddities
jimmie
garants
had
no
schlitz
on
hand
regardless
i
enthusiastically
give
two
schlitz
for
this
amazing
brew
o
yet
another
interesting
beer
from
shorts
i
dont
think
id
buy
this
one
again
but
im
glad
that
i
did
try
it
i
would
be
curious
how
it
would
mix
with
other
beers
though
to
perhaps
round
it
out
a
little
bit
this
may
actually
be
what
i
consider
one
of
shorts
stranger
brews
and
thats
saying
something
buying
a
single
rather
than
a
6pk
is
highly
recommended
o
interesting
and
bonus
points
for
the
novelty
i
guess
i
had
trouble
finishing
the
bottle
though
overall
the
growler
tastes
alil
different
than
the
bottle
like
i
said
it
seems
like
the
hops
are
coming
through
more
there
really
tasty
cheers
overall
very
nice
golden
hue
glows
in
the
glass
whispy
white
head
appears
and
fades
to
lace
aromas
are
very
piney
good
hop
presence
and
the
spruce
wafts
in
and
out
flavor
is
very
nice
very
bitter
and
foresty
the
spruce
is
nicely
integrated
the
massive
hops
carry
it
through
and
there
is
enough
base
malt
to
give
a
slight
balance
to
it
definitely
hop
forward
but
nicely
done
definitely
the
best
spruce
beer
ive
had
wow
the
bitterness
runs
rampant
in
this
beer
the
spruce
adds
a
nice
touch
but
it
needs
some
more
balance
o
another
beer
that
presents
what
shorts
does
best
lots
of
intense
flavors
without
feeling
too
convoluted
couldnt
drink
more
than
one
or
two
a
night
but
could
have
no
problem
revisiting
frequently
a
little
off
the
mark
for
a
pilsner
but
the
basic
pilsner
premise
is
in
there
and
creating
one
is
an
exact
science
shorts
just
took
a
mad
scientist
approach
enjoyable
and
recommended
o
pretty
interesting
beer
all
around
its
definitely
got
a
clean
sharp
bitterness
going
for
it
which
sounds
like
what
the
brewer
was
intending
one
of
the
better
beers
ive
had
from
shorts
thanks
again
jay
the
beer
pours
a
nice
golden
color
with
a
thin
head
of
white
bubbles
pure
spruce
in
the
nose
with
just
a
hint
of
hops
and
sweet
malt
this
has
all
the
apperence
of
a
beer
but
almost
none
of
the
taste
like
eating
spruce
sap
right
from
the
tree
way
too
much
spruce
for
me
i
drank
half
of
my
half
of
the
bottle
and
topped
off
my
glass
with
whatever
pale
ale
i
was
drinking
and
that
was
about
as
much
spruce
as
i
wanted
in
this
beer
i
was
looking
forward
to
trying
this
as
i
do
alot
of
shorts
beers
and
was
dissapointed
as
i
am
with
a
lot
of
shorts
beers
overall
this
is
another
head
scratcher
i
appreciate
the
pushing
of
the
envelope
and
the
sheer
novelty
this
brewery
has
been
known
to
pump
out
but
repeating
an
experience
with
this
brew
has
proven
to
be
a
chore
a
single
bottle
may
have
left
a
better
taste
behind
but
an
entire
sixer
is
a
cumbersome
load
that
lingers
without
a
solid
place
in
the
rotation
buy
one
try
one
or
buy
six
and
trade
five
and
let
others
get
a
taste
definitely
try
this
beer
if
only
for
its
unusual
nature
although
you
might
be
best
advised
to
split
that
6pack
among
friends
that
being
said
it
does
what
its
trying
to
do
exquisitely
well
o
this
is
another
great
experimental
brew
from
shorts
the
actual
spruce
tips
work
with
the
hops
to
really
showcase
what
a
pine
profile
can
accomplish
that
said
as
the
pine
qualities
build
this
becomes
a
single
serving
sort
of
beer
i
wont
hesitate
to
crack
open
my
second
bottle
at
some
point
but
backtoback
would
be
a
bit
much
for
me
the
pine
does
overwhelm
or
become
a
little
long
by
the
end
of
the
bottle
overall
from
the
aromas
in
the
beginning
right
down
to
the
last
drop
of
deliciousness
left
in
the
glass
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
and
probably
one
of
if
not
the
best
pilsner
that
i
have
had
to
date
very
enjoyable
and
a
very
well
balanced
and
complex
pilsner
as
well
great
bitter
flavours
from
the
resin
and
pine
needle
a
nice
mixed
of
hops
and
bready
malts
and
finishes
with
a
somewhat
sweet
flavour
of
apricots
and
grapefruit
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
one
as
i
had
somewhat
low
expectations
when
i
first
picked
it
up
at
the
liquor
store
but
am
now
wishing
i
had
picked
up
more
than
just
a
review
bottle
would
definitely
pick
this
one
up
again
and
will
be
on
the
lookout
my
next
trip
down
to
michigan
o
i
love
this
beer
its
different
enough
exciting
enough
to
be
exactly
what
a
summer
evening
calls
for
piney
and
sweet
and
just
right
o
this
is
a
very
good
offering
from
shorts
the
strong
bitterness
may
not
be
for
everyone
but
i
really
enjoyed
it
wackiest
beer
ive
had
from
shorts
there
are
parts
that
are
enjoyable
to
this
beer
but
the
taste
is
a
little
too
much
to
enjoy
more
than
a
bottle
i
recommend
people
to
seek
this
out
however
because
of
the
noveltycraziness
of
it
obviously
there
are
many
people
that
enjoy
it
given
the
a
grade
here
on
ba
i
wouldnt
turn
down
a
pourbottle
of
this
but
doubt
ill
seek
it
out
overall
this
is
a
hophead
or
spruce
lovers
dream
very
memorable
and
unique
enough
that
one
is
not
quick
to
forget
it
overall
a
very
solid
beer
and
very
indicative
of
the
style
thank
you
hurfer
for
the
opportunity
drink
this
was
very
tasty
little
beer
that
was
quite
new
and
unique
to
me
im
not
normally
a
pilsner
fan
and
even
more
a
double
or
imperial
shorts
does
some
good
stuff
o
i
like
this
and
i
look
forward
to
trying
it
next
year
edit
just
had
the
2012
release
and
i
am
bumping
the
aroma
up
to
a
4
its
full
of
blue
spruce
and
grapefruit
i
really
like
it
this
one
of
the
beer
that
i
always
anticipate
shorts
release
it
one
good
and
intense
beer
update
i
just
tried
the
2013
release
and
this
one
is
almost
a
different
its
so
much
more
balanced
without
the
tons
of
bitterness
i
have
got
in
years
past
i
like
this
one
almost
as
much
as
the
other
years
its
much
more
drinkable
but
it
doesnt
have
that
super
intense
spruce
flavor
like
years
past
its
good
and
it
seems
like
the
intestity
was
toned
down
to
enhance
the
drinkability
i
think
the
pilsener
base
shows
up
much
more
in
the
years
release
its
still
a
damn
good
beer
that
i
always
look
forward
too
pours
a
light
golden
yellow
with
a
white
head
that
has
very
good
retention
and
lacing
the
carbonation
is
good
also
the
nose
has
a
strong
pine
and
citrus
scent
to
it
the
taste
starts
out
with
some
pine
and
citrus
hops
that
stay
in
the
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
but
on
the
dry
side
and
overall
it
is
a
nice
pilsner
that
reminds
me
of
a
strong
ipa
overall
avery
good
solid
beer
with
a
huge
pine
aroma
and
flavor
i
will
definitely
buy
this
beer
again
this
really
is
one
of
my
favorite
shorts
seasonals
you
really
should
try
this
if
you
find
it
in
stock
it
really
is
an
experience
to
be
had
pours
a
golden
yeloow
color
with
a
tight
one
finger
soapy
head
which
gives
way
to
a
little
bit
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
big
bold
spruce
it
is
like
sniffing
a
christmas
tree
there
are
hints
of
lemon
and
citrus
underneath
but
the
big
star
is
the
spruce
it
is
very
inviting
the
taste
has
a
hint
of
lemon
at
first
but
then
big
big
spruce
taste
very
piney
and
oily
and
very
bitter
it
is
a
very
unquie
taste
but
very
enjoyable
the
mouthfeel
is
moderately
carbonated
overall
it
is
a
very
solid
beer
it
has
a
bigger
bolder
yet
smoother
flavor
than
other
spruces
i
have
tried
overall
just
a
very
good
beer
it
left
me
wanting
more
golden
hue
with
a
thick
white
head
the
nose
is
full
of
hops
some
citrus
herbal
pine
spruce
slight
sweetness
buried
somewhere
beneath
the
taste
follows
suit
and
the
malt
quietly
attempts
to
add
balance
but
lets
face
it
this
one
is
hop
forward
and
heavy
on
the
spruce
this
brew
had
a
medium
body
and
had
medium
carbonation
i
liked
this
tasty
treat
but
perhaps
too
much
spruce
for
me
to
have
more
than
one
this
is
a
medium
to
light
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
the
spruce
brings
out
a
lemon
and
oily
bitterness
which
is
very
bold
certainly
not
your
typical
pilsner
this
brew
was
a
little
rough
going
down
interesting
take
on
the
style
and
certainly
something
different
that
is
worth
a
try
beer
is
too
dry
too
high
in
alcohol
and
too
much
like
a
tree
i
do
get
everything
youd
expect
from
licking
a
tree
including
wood
and
spruce
needles
its
just
way
too
much
for
me
congratulations
its
a
tree
youve
done
it
pours
a
slightlyhazed
goldenorange
color
with
a
good
white
head
with
mild
retention
time
and
a
slight
collar
on
the
way
down
the
nose
is
incredible
with
ginormous
amounts
of
heavy
spruce
and
pine
really
quite
awesome
the
taste
follows
down
the
same
path
not
sure
how
else
to
describe
this
other
than
to
say
that
the
spruce
character
is
nearly
overwhelming
and
i
absolutely
love
it
bitter
and
resinous
the
mouthfeel
is
killer
i
could
drink
this
until
my
mouth
completely
dried
out
delicious
drinkability
relatively
so
for
the
style
i
love
shorts
because
of
their
impressive
way
to
make
a
beer
that
sounds
like
it
would
be
bad
to
be
damn
good
cheers
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
i
really
liked
it
ive
had
spruce
beers
before
and
wasnt
impressed
at
all
this
one
however
is
different
i
really
liked
how
they
mixed
the
spruce
with
a
lot
of
citrusy
hops
it
was
very
drinkable
and
added
some
very
cool
flavors
and
a
twist
to
a
hoppy
beer
very
nice
beer
overall
and
i
have
to
say
im
surprised
i
liked
it
so
much
d
i
was
expecting
something
else
but
was
surprised
by
this
beer
i
was
expecting
a
less
drinkable
beer
but
it
was
not
the
flavor
was
not
overwhelming
and
was
good
all
around
d
this
is
another
good
beer
from
shorts
however
with
all
the
overpowering
lemon
and
mint
going
on
this
is
not
the
most
drinkable
brew
pours
a
surprisingly
light
golden
color
with
about
a
fingers
worth
of
head
smells
like
hops
and
spruce
with
a
little
malt
damn
i
always
forget
when
shorts
does
something
like
say
use
spruce
needles
they
go
all
out
tastes
hoppy
and
christmasy
but
in
a
good
way
first
thing
i
noticed
was
spruce
then
a
lot
of
high
alpha
hops
finished
with
a
huge
bitterness
spruce
in
the
aftertaste
as
well
mouthfeel
is
good
and
drinkability
im
not
sure
i
only
have
one
but
i
could
probably
drink
one
more
shorts
doesnt
play
around
when
they
set
out
to
do
something
they
do
it
good
job
poured
a
clear
medium
dark
golden
color
with
a
decent
little
white
head
aromas
of
pine
needles
resiny
hops
and
spearmint
on
the
palate
this
one
was
crisp
and
somewhat
syrupy
medium
bodied
and
challenging
at
times
overwhelming
christmas
tree
here
with
mint
a
pine
forest
and
some
sweet
malt
although
this
brewery
has
produced
a
few
good
beers
they
almost
seem
to
experiment
for
the
sake
of
experiment
this
really
is
like
a
hoppy
christmas
tree
the
scent
and
the
taste
is
just
like
a
christmas
tree
but
alas
it
works
such
a
great
combo
and
i
had
this
a
few
months
after
release
and
still
tasted
fresh
imagine
the
pine
aspect
of
hops
kicked
in
by
100
awesome
beer
drinkability
is
good
this
scores
points
just
for
the
uniqueness
light
years
better
to
me
than
the
alaskan
winter
brew
that
also
has
spruce
tips
in
it
with
that
being
said
i
dont
think
i
would
want
to
drink
more
than
one
of
these
per
session
its
a
bit
of
a
palate
destroyer
well
worth
tracking
down
d
i
like
but
i
wouldnt
buy
it
all
the
time
id
definitely
order
a
second
pint
its
unique
it
grew
on
me
poured
to
a
one
inch
head
head
was
slightly
offwhite
in
color
beer
itself
was
a
light
brownish
yellow
and
cloudy
had
some
lacing
going
on
and
left
rings
with
every
swallow
head
hung
around
for
a
little
while
smell
was
nothing
but
pine
a
deep
pine
smell
just
like
you
broke
a
branch
off
a
pine
tree
and
took
a
wiff
tasted
very
piney
i
mean
strong
pine
no
alcohol
taste
had
a
slight
bitter
aftertaste
of
pine
also
a
little
on
the
dry
side
felt
good
in
the
mouth
carbonation
was
good
also
i
got
this
bottle
from
a
friend
ill
be
buying
a
sixer
tomorrow
just
a
note
the
alcohol
was
evident
after
a
few
swallows
you
got
that
warm
alcohol
feeling

d
the
taste
really
gets
to
me
i
know
this
beer
isnt
meant
to
be
guzzled
in
the
first
place
but
this
one
was
hard
to
finish
im
glad
i
traded
all
my
other
bottles
away
as
one
is
enough
for
me
this
was
a
very
intriguing
beer
and
id
recommend
it
to
someone
whos
willing
to
test
their
palate
slightly
cloudy
pilsner
with
a
medium
white
head
and
good
lacing
aroma
is
pine
with
a
hint
of
citrus
flavor
is
a
pine
explosion
the
first
bottle
i
had
i
honestly
didnt
like
it
im
now
at
the
end
of
my
six
pack
and
have
come
to
appreciate
it
flavor
is
heavy
pine
dominant
with
some
citrus
hop
flavor
and
a
touch
of
grain
sweetness
the
biggest
drawback
to
this
beer
is
drinkability
just
one
is
more
than
enough
love
this
one
excellent
beer
unique
tasty
punches
my
nostalgia
button
for
the
north
woods
i
havent
seen
in
two
days
i
need
to
go
back
thanks
shorts
while
i
personally
liked
this
i
could
definitely
see
how
some
might
not
i
will
say
that
the
boldness
of
the
profile
does
subside
some
as
this
warms
up
leaving
behind
a
lot
of
flavor
but
with
less
bitterness
than
when
this
first
starts
out
the
crisp
killer
body
on
this
ultimately
really
makes
this
though
keeping
everything
together
and
in
check
this
was
my
first
experience
with
a
spruce
tip
beer
and
i
really
dug
it
interesting
i
respect
the
effort
and
creativity
but
i
will
probably
not
drink
the
whole
six
pack
myself
but
rather
send
them
away
as
extras
definitely
worth
trying
because
of
its
uniqueness
its
just
really
not
doing
it
for
me
very
drinkable
this
was
the
star
of
the
shorts
lineup
we
tried
at
hopcat
the
others
being
the
2009
anniversary
wheatwine
and
the
black
licorice
lager
all
three
were
good
though
i
cant
wait
for
this
one
to
be
bottled
again
as
i
will
be
picking
up
several
sixers
beautiful
nose
of
spruce
tips
a
nice
little
foam
lacing
with
a
cloudy
yellow
color
flavor
is
a
bit
acetic
for
my
taste
but
drinkable
by
all
means
pours
a
slightly
gold
tinged
pale
yellow
with
a
fluffy
and
bubbly
head
that
leaves
wonderfully
sticky
lacing
the
aroma
is
quite
pleasing
with
lots
of
pine
and
nice
grapefruit
citrus
notes
the
malt
component
of
the
flavor
is
quite
grainy
and
a
little
toasty
even
taking
a
sip
i
am
blown
away
by
this
beers
complexity
spruce
is
definitely
the
first
thing
i
pick
up
but
there
also
is
a
good
amount
of
citrusy
and
piney
hops
in
there
the
malt
backbone
is
fairly
sweet
and
both
toasty
and
slightly
buttery
it
mingles
well
with
the
pine
flavors
and
makes
me
a
believer
i
am
also
picking
up
some
interesting
green
herbal
notes
and
some
minty
medicinal
qualities
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
a
fairly
dry
finish
that
coats
the
tongue
the
drinkability
on
this
is
insane
for
being
10
i
dig
it
and
while
i
couldnt
see
myself
downing
these
one
after
another
i
definitely
wish
i
had
another
bottle
right
now
i
have
to
admit
i
came
to
this
one
not
very
optimistic
last
spruce
beer
i
had
was
godawful
and
one
of
my
only
drain
pours
in
a
long
line
of
beers
shorts
really
pulls
this
off
by
balancing
the
spruce
with
a
heavy
hand
of
hops
could
not
do
much
of
this
but
it
tends
to
be
very
enjoyable
would
love
to
try
the
10
version
d
amazingly
high
i
love
this
beer
i
will
seek
out
bottles
of
the
old
and
the
new
batch
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
this
is
what
american
brewing
is
all
about
when
i
looked
this
up
on
ba
after
i
had
had
a
few
sips
i
couldnt
believe
it
was
10
this
thing
could
be
anywhere
from
48
but
i
didnt
think
it
would
be
10
for
that
i
will
give
it
a
high
mark
overall
this
is
a
great
brew
it
masks
its
alcohol
content
and
has
a
delicious
hop
and
pine
taste
that
really
stands
out
i
couldnt
drink
a
bunch
of
these
in
one
sitting
not
because
of
the
abv
but
rather
just
how
strong
and
pronounced
the
flavor
is
really
great
and
unique
beer
though
overall
a
unique
and
epic
beer
that
ranks
with
the
best
ive
ever
had
this
beer
does
not
taste
like
10
not
even
close
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
imperial
pilsners
some
things
arent
necessary
its
like
souping
up
a
pinto
but
this
one
is
nice
and
drinkable
without
being
in
the
least
bit
cloying
or
alcohol
hot
if
someone
told
me
this
is
5
5
i
wouldnt
doubt
them
i
guess
the
spruce
adds
something
to
this
beer
that
i
normally
dont
get
in
any
other
imperial
pilsner
ive
ever
had
good
stuff
this
is
certainly
a
pretty
wild
beer
by
shorts
and
it
comes
close
to
really
working
well
the
reason
it
doesnt
quite
get
there
is
not
because
its
over
the
top
but
because
it
slips
down
the
slippery
slope
toward
being
medicinal
beer
and
cough
drops
dont
mix
and
that
flavor
hurts
the
beer
in
my
opinion
as
i
said
before
its
better
as
it
warms
and
if
i
have
it
again
i
will
let
it
warm
up
before
digging
deeply
into
the
glass
thats
a
curious
approach
with
a
pils
but
it
helps
cut
the
cough
drop
flavor
at
the
end
of
the
day
this
is
a
nice
effort
by
shorts
but
i
cant
call
it
a
triumph
delisiously
quaffable
at
10
ouch
d
i
think
this
is
more
of
a
once
in
awhile
experience
for
me
the
spruce
flavor
is
an
inventive
novelty
especially
in
a
lager
but
i
dont
think
this
would
be
a
regular
in
my
beer
drinking
lineup
d
what
a
cool
beer
and
beer
experience
i
definitely
recommend
it
if
you
can
get
it
overall
impression
interesting
piney
hoppy
pils
very
enjoyable
immsensely
drinkable
and
delivers
as
advertised
thanks
to
malty
for
the
chance
to
enjoy
this
delightful
beer
definitive
proof
that
shorts
brewing
knows
what
extreme
beer
is
all
about
no
pussyfooting
here
taste
and
learn
because
this
one
is
the
real
thing
without
a
doubt
the
combo
of
spruce
and
hops
within
a
big
lager
works
d
i
got
more
than
i
bargained
for
with
this
beer
as
i
didnt
notice
the
imperial
distinction
until
i
got
home
still
its
a
happy
accident
as
a
proud
michigander
this
is
a
nice
regional
retwist
on
a
west
coast
twist
i
just
wish
it
drank
a
little
more
like
a
pils
d
this
is
definitely
a
different
pilsner
right
away
you
get
the
spruce
and
it
is
pleasant
at
first
but
almost
becomes
too
much
drinking
the
whole
bottle
for
me
but
certainly
not
a
bad
beer
d
a
unique
intriguing
and
sessionable
take
on
the
style
i
dig
it
pours
very
clear
yellow
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
that
forms
about
threequarterinch
head
that
falls
slowly
leaving
lace
behind
but
never
really
goes
away
really
interesting
combination
of
aromas
hops
toasted
malts
and
of
course
spruce
wood
tastes
woody
and
crisp
with
lightly
toasted
malt
and
peppery
hop
notes
surprisingly
lightbodied
dry
with
a
powerfully
bitter
hop
finish
and
slight
alcohol
bite
that
eventually
fades
as
a
lingering
hop
bitterness
coats
the
tongue
overall
i
would
say
this
is
perilously
drinkable
and
quite
tasty
and
bitter
i
really
liked
this
beer
i
knew
it
was
way
more
massive
than
any
regular
pilsner
its
more
like
a
run
away
iipa
the
12
ounce
bottle
released
in
2010
is
lighter
with
loads
of
sweet
pine
flavors
and
more
drinkable
than
the
original
maybe
just
being
fresher
than
the
3year
old
750
ml
bottle
i
had
previously
makes
the
difference
dgreat
summertime
beer
ridiculously
drinkable
for
the
abv
very
refreshing
d
i
am
enjoying
the
first
couple
i
think
i
may
end
there
though
md
yea
it
was
alright
smooth
but
just
such
a
weird
taste
tastes
just
like
it
smells
only
stronger
lots
of
bitterness
pine
sap
and
more
pine
on
top
of
that
this
is
a
really
unique
beer
but
not
something
i
would
choose
to
have
more
than
one
or
two
in
one
sitting
overall
a
sensory
overload
of
a
lager
id
love
to
pair
this
with
some
spicy
thai
food
andor
a
zesty
herbladen
pizza
since
ive
got
5
more
bottles
im
definitely
going
to
be
on
a
food
pairing
quest
to
showcase
all
of
this
beers
qualities
leave
it
to
shorts
to
blow
my
mind
once
again
the
10
00abv
brings
a
slight
sweetness
and
a
warming
touch
with
it
this
is
the
part
of
this
beer
that
will
keep
it
from
perfection
as
far
as
drinkability
other
than
that
it
is
very
easy
to
consume
and
very
enjoyable
all
in
all
a
real
treat
d
the
pils
is
complex
that
complexity
including
the
overpowering
spruce
flavor
makes
finishing
the
bottle
difficult
pow
d
cant
drink
a
ton
of
this
one
but
damn
is
it
unique
and
tasty
thanks
to
deuane

of

a
capped
750ml
bottle
poured
into
my
nonic
imperial
pint
glass
the
lager
appears
a
hazed
golden
amber
color
with
a
full
two
fingers
of
creamy
off
white
head
well
the
aromas
and
flavors
are
certainly
dominated
by
notes
of
resinous
spruce
sap
and
needles
as
well
as
pine
gin
caramel
malt
grass
and
grains
moderately
carbonated
and
nearly
full
bodied
with
a
touch
of
alcohol
as
it
warms
overall
an
intense
dose
of
spruce
if
you
dig
that
flavor
enjoy
the
bottle
alone
if
not
this
is
a
good
one
to
share
with
friends
bottle
from
the
brewery
tremendous
aroma
from
the
tips
of
the
tree
i
enjoyed
this
forest
grapefruit
body
with
white
lasting
head
carbonation
there
and
helps
drinkability
which
is
easy
taste
is
pineyjuicy
a
bit
of
citrus
saaz
hops
above
average
mouthfeel
doutstanding
in
its
flavour
but
this
fact
makes
this
one
a
bit
tough
to
enjoy
in
mass
quantities
i
am
glad
i
could
share
this
bottle
i
like
the
taste
but
it
does
become
too
much
another
brew
from
shorts
that
does
not
back
away
from
the
flavour
line
but
instead
vaults
on
past
it
the
taste
is
good
but
overpowering
tons
of
lilac
and
an
overpowering
malt
sweetness
that
becomes
overbearing
after
a
few
sips
still
very
well
executed
as
shorts
captured
the
name
perfectly
the
hops
are
incredibly
fresh
which
makes
this
easier
to
throw
down
very
creamy
mouthfeel
nicely
done
boys
keep
crankin
out
these
off
the
wall
beers
overall
this
is
an
incredible
beer
like
nothing
else
i
have
ever
tried
or
imagined
but
it
is
so
off
the
wall
that
this
is
a
oneanddone
for
me
shared
very
graciously
by
gford217
at
the
brick
store
pub
awhile
ago
im
fascinated
by
these
shorts
beers
and
especially
by
this
one
i
happen
to
be
a
fan
of
that
spruce
flavor
and
i
strongly
suspect
that
more
than
a
few
batches
of
spruce
beers
were
made
by
the
early
settlers
if
you
like
gin
youll
probably
love
this
beer
as
its
got
that
same
strong
piney
aroma
and
taste
but
sharper
and
sappier
that
gin
gets
from
juniper
pours
a
hazy
golden
with
a
thin
wispy
head
not
too
bad
for
a
beer
this
strong
thats
been
around
for
a
while
smells
strongly
of
spruce
and
juniper
like
a
northern
forest
on
a
warm
day
and
with
undercurrents
of
candi
sugar
the
taste
once
again
spotlights
the
spruce
with
the
sappy
snap
of
pine
ringing
out
against
just
enough
malt
to
provide
a
nice
framework
for
the
spruce
you
may
or
may
not
care
for
this
but
for
what
it
is
i
think
it
is
perfect
and
very
nicely
balanced
this
is
clearly
still
beer
and
not
a
spruce
eau
de
vie
smooth
and
piney
but
not
sticky
or
sappy
or
too
bitter
in
the
mouthfeel
extremely
interesting
beer
and
well
crafted
from
this
most
exciting
brewery
thanks
a
bunch
grant
id
been
wanting
to
try
this
for
a
long
time
drinkability
this
beer
reminds
me
a
lot
of
the
orbitz
mint
mango
gum
my
buddy
was
saying
that
the
spruce
is
intense
which
it
is
but
i
dont
think
its
exceedingly
over
the
top
this
is
an
extremely
unique
beer
that
i
really
enjoyed
i
probably
couldnt
drink
this
too
often
but
i
did
enjoy
the
hell
out
of
it
thanks
ed
well
being
a
lover
of
pine
hops
i
was
really
looking
forward
to
this
one
and
it
absolutely
delivered
the
goods
its
certainly
intense
and
probably
a
little
overthetop
but
since
its
intensity
is
focused
on
something
i
enjoy
so
much
ive
got
no
other
option
but
to
love
this
beer
thank
you
shorts
poured
a
glimmering
hazed
gold
sweet
sticky
alpha
hop
aroma
spruce
high
quality
caramel
pretty
wild
that
this
still
has
so
much
aroma
2
years
down
the
road
sticky
resiny
sweet
with
a
building
herbal
spruce
or
spearmint
flavor
that
culminates
in
a
long
bitter
finish
body
is
thick
and
robust
for
a
pilsner
theres
a
spicy
tingle
on
the
finish
that
must
be
what
chewing
on
spruce
needles
tastes
like
overall
good
in
small
doses
definitely
a
fine
example
of
creative
brewing
overall
this
is
easily
the
piniest
beer
that
ive
had
and
it
surprised
me
by
not
being
too
over
the
top
definitely
worth
a
shot
overall
would
have
been
better
served
by
being
toned
down
a
good
bit
but
it
was
just
way
overboard
sometimes
you
dont
need
to
go
soo
big
with
things
joe
is
a
maniac
and
it
turns
out
that
maniacs
can
make
some
tasty
beer
overall
an
interesting
beer
it
has
more
in
common
with
a
double
ipa
than
a
pilsner
with
spruce
replacing
any
flavor
hops
however
being
a
lager
it
lacks
the
fruitiness
of
an
ipa
while
at
the
same
time
the
alcohol
hops
and
spruce
overpower
the
bready
malt
nuances
you
get
from
a
traditional
pilsner
not
a
bad
beer
and
worth
trying
but
i
think
this
wouldve
been
better
as
a
double
ipa
and
i
say
that
as
somebody
who
generally
prefers
a
nice
pilsner
to
an
ipa
holy
shit
this
beer
is
intense
soooo
incredibly
piney
pinesol
booze
with
loads
of
resinous
hops
and
juniper
berries
its
all
together
too
much
for
me
but
i
respect
the
ability
of
shorts
to
craft
something
this
monstrous
mouthfeel
is
crisp
wellcarbonated
and
packs
a
lasting
bitter
finish
of
you
guessed
it
pine
i
loved
trying
this
beer
and
it
was
perfect
for
a
3oz
tasting
but
there
is
absolutely
no
way
i
could
make
it
through
a
full
glass
let
alone
a
bottle
of
this
stuff
potential
drainpour
in
large
amounts
big
majorous
props
to
ba
erikthered
for
hauling
this
gem
all
the
way
to
cooperstown
for
me
thanks
man
d
not
overly
easy
to
drink
but
very
interesting
notes
from
2808
thanks
hoppymeal
for
another
opportunity
to
sample
beer
from
this
amazing
brewery
a
pillow
like
three
fingers
of
rocky
light
tan
head
seems
to
last
very
well
a
murky
haze
of
wheat
colored
glowing
orange
makes
up
the
body
a
crown
of
scattered
lace
is
left
as
the
head
slowly
fades
nose
is
like
a
pine
forest
just
after
the
rain
with
a
bit
of
musk
thrown
in
taste
stays
with
this
same
tone
with
tons
of
up
front
musky
pine
like
liquid
pine
needles
when
it
comes
down
to
it
it
really
tastes
like
a
christmas
tree
a
bit
of
a
bitter
bite
joins
in
on
the
back
of
the
palate
a
bit
of
sweetness
arrives
in
the
middle
as
it
warms
the
piney
feel
is
just
shy
of
harsh
on
the
mouthfeel
and
throughout
drinkability
is
well
short
i
think
the
pine
needles
could
have
spent
about
half
the
time
in
the
brewing
process
and
you
would
have
still
got
the
desired
effect
one
of
the
beers
i
was
looking
most
forward
to
trying
from
the
imperial
series
and
i
was
a
bit
let
down
could
not
believe
how
fresh
it
smelled
and
tasted
though
interesting
experiment
but
i
do
not
know
if
it
necessarily
works
this
is
a
beer
i
would
only
need
to
try
once
still
worth
trying
as
it
is
very
unique
if
youre
a
lover
of
all
things
evergreen
check
out
this
sticky
little
pinesicle
been
sitting
on
this
bottle
since
feb
when
i
did
a
trade
for
several
shorts
beer
with
hoppymealthanks
derek
and
wanted
to
open
it
ever
since
bottle
number
202
of
886
poured
into
pizza
port
6th
ann
real
ale
glass
pours
a
golden
hazy
color
with
a
very
slight
orange
tint
and
a
thick
white
foamy
head
good
lacing
on
the
head
smell
is
like
the
name
i
got
a
huge
whiff
of
pine
mixed
with
some
citrus
and
a
little
spice
in
the
background
inter
mixing
with
a
sweet
malt
profile
taste
is
pine
sap
and
lots
of
it
but
still
layers
of
citrus
and
bitter
sweet
malt
profile
mouthfeel
is
light
body
with
low
carbonation
i
wish
i
had
another
bottle
of
this
beer
i
love
hops
but
now
i
love
spruce
and
hops
together
this
beer
should
be
made
year
round
drinkability
i
liked
this
but
i
am
not
certain
other
people
would
this
was
poignantly
flavored
and
made
me
feel
like
i
was
walking
in
a
pine
forest
unique
and
worth
a
try
among
friends
to
share
incredible
i
really
hope
some
other
brewers
get
on
the
spruce
tip
bandwagon
perfect
response
to
the
hop
shortage
and
with
that
i
bump
this
one
up
to
the
10
reviews
it
needs
to
be
in
the
top
10
for
style
and
deservedly
so
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
creamy
with
a
medium
body
that
makes
for
a
really
solid
drinking
experience
good
carbonation
at
work
here
as
well
overall
an
incredibly
unique
brew
that
ended
up
being
very
tasty
and
unlike
any
other
i
have
had
i
shared
this
and
i
think
a
whole
bottle
might
be
much
but
hey
its
always
better
to
share
anyways
i
wish
i
had
another
of
these
cause
i
keep
thinking
about
it
cheers
to
shorts
this
is
one
of
the
most
unique
beers
ive
ever
had
period
imo
joe
short
is
pushing
the
envelope
of
extremeexperimental
beers
in
a
very
meaningful
direction
cheers
to
hoppymeal
for
this
treat
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
sweet
up
front
yeasty
spice
pours
a
faintly
cloudy
golden
hay
with
a
cumulus
pillow
of
thick
rocky
light
beige
head
exceptional
lacing
doughy
biscuit
and
buttered
roll
malts
hide
behind
a
big
wall
of
grapefruit
and
marmalade
hops
and
an
incredible
fresh
spruce
needlesap
aroma
wow
the
name
does
not
lie
this
is
a
spruced
beer
conventional
herbal
hop
bitterness
hits
up
front
caramel
and
powdered
sugar
pastry
malt
mix
with
rummy
fruits
midpalate
theres
considerable
sweetness
coming
from
these
malt
flavors
but
the
citrus
minty
and
mostly
evergreen
hop
bitterness
and
the
huge
spruce
needlesap
more
than
balance
it
out
the
finish
is
so
herbally
bitter
and
sprucey
that
i
can
hardly
believe
it
phenomenal
fullbodied
with
a
syrupy
feel
although
the
finish
is
drier
so
intensely
sprucey
and
hoppy
that
it
would
be
hard
for
even
the
most
hophead
of
bas
to
drink
more
than
one
bottle
but
what
an
experience
bottle
5
of
886
an
imperial
pilsner
brewed
with
northern
michigan
blue
spruce
needles
pours
honey
gold
in
color
with
a
slight
haze
a
large
fluffy
white
head
builds
and
slowly
recedes
lacing
heavily
as
it
does
so
aroma
shows
some
very
nice
citrusy
sweet
hops
sweet
tangerines
grapefruit
and
oranges
then
a
pine
needle
aroma
comes
in
strongly
like
a
fresh
cut
christmas
tree
very
strong
and
straight
up
piney
wow
the
taste
is
pure
pineyness
like
drinking
a
pine
soda
or
syrup
but
its
beer
there
is
a
nice
sized
malty
sweetness
that
really
helps
to
accentuate
the
pine
flavor
a
slight
perfuminess
follows
the
pine
in
the
finish
along
with
some
bitter
and
dryness
and
of
course
a
pine
aftertaste
that
blends
quite
well
with
a
warming
alcohol
this
beer
reminds
me
of
one
of
the
anchor
osas
that
was
large
pine
flavor
but
then
some
this
beer
is
incredibly
unique
with
a
great
flavor
and
mouthfeel
but
you
have
to
like
pine
flavor
a
lot
to
drink
all
of
this
which
i
do
and
did
750mls
may
be
a
bit
much
for
some
with
the
flavor
and
the
sweetness
so
share
this
beer
it
is
intense
and
very
extraordinary
high
c
thanks
to
the
forgotten
ba
who
sent
this
to
me
as
an
extra
overall
not
quite
what
i
expected
nothing
really
resembling
a
pilsner
at
all
some
booze
lots
of
sweet
syrupy
malts
and
candy
flavors
some
hops
decent
tasting
but
not
nearly
a
pilsner
like
beer
even
a
double
pilsner
serving
type
bomber
poured
into
a
pint
mouthfeel
is
the
best
part
of
this
beer
the
hops
finally
kick
some
booty
with
a
crisp
bite
and
sharp
pinch
of
the
tongue
thin
carbonation
and
a
warm
malt
finish
round
out
this
slightly
average
beer
ive
got
to
say
im
unimpressed
but
happy
to
see
rahr
moving
in
this
direction
this
beer
is
worth
trying
just
to
support
your
local
brewery
poured
from
a
22
oz
bottle
into
a
pilsner
glass
unknown
freshness
date
this
pours
a
light
golden
color
with
a
massive
off
white
head
the
smells
are
a
little
light
but
i
get
grassy
hops
with
a
little
malt
the
feel
is
medium
to
light
the
taste
is
pretty
good
i
get
a
load
of
hop
bitterness
with
a
little
malt
even
though
i
think
this
is
older
it
seems
to
have
more
hop
bite
than
other
imperial
pilsners
ive
had
pretty
solid
brew
nicely
balanced
maybe
just
a
touch
sweet
drinkable
and
tasty
although
the
imperial
could
be
easily
lost
without
detriment
this
has
a
very
rich
creamy
mouthfeel
with
excellent
carbonation
it
is
very
drinkable
meh
nothing
special
really
but
nothing
really
wrong
with
it
either
o
not
bad
at
all
ive
only
had
one
imperial
pilsner
before
and
i
cant
even
remember
which
one
so
ive
got
little
to
go
on
as
far
as
the
style
is
concerned
but
i
like
this
its
got
some
character
to
it
and
for
a
lager
it
bears
more
than
a
striking
resemblance
to
an
ale
it
is
a
clear
burnt
orange
color
with
a
thick
and
lofty
tan
colored
head
that
spilled
over
the
glass
the
smell
is
sweet
grain
and
alcohol
with
lemon
and
pine
the
taste
has
sweet
woody
flavor
with
some
pine
and
lemon
there
is
a
lot
of
sweet
malt
the
beer
is
thick
and
soft
and
smooth
has
a
nice
bitter
bite
that
kicks
in
midswallow
there
is
a
very
dry
finish
this
is
the
first
i
have
had
of
this
style
and
was
very
impressed
by
rahr
o
cant
say
that
ive
ever
had
an
imperial
pilsner
before
so
its
hard
to
compare
it
but
i
just
didnt
enjoy
it
tasted
like
a
light
pilsner
they
just
upped
the
grain
bill
on
and
didnt
really
add
any
backbone
to
or
anything
interesting
it
pours
light
copper
with
a
thick
offwhite
creamy
head
doesnt
look
like
a
anything
pilsner
but
thats
fine
by
me
smell
is
caramel
malt
with
roselike
hops
coming
on
as
the
beer
settles
and
the
aromas
have
a
chance
to
get
going
in
the
glass
taste
is
assertive
with
the
hops
and
the
malt
vying
for
attention
the
hops
seem
to
be
mostly
about
the
bittering
not
too
much
in
the
aroma
bringing
out
some
leatherlike
tastes
and
onion
mouthfeel
is
tingly
but
slick
making
me
feel
funny
like
when
i
climbed
the
rope
in
gym
class
overall
good
but
the
hops
start
building
up
in
the
aftertaste
for
me
kind
of
an
accumulative
effect
those
whose
heads
are
hoppier
than
mine
will
enjoy
this
better
still
an
interesting
brew
and
a
great
different
take
on
a
pilsner
o
this
one
didnt
blow
me
away
but
it
was
a
solid
offering
i
may
go
grab
a
few
more
bombers
to
enjoy
over
the
summer
but
at
around
9
a
pop
they
arent
cheap
taste
is
interesting
and
better
than
i
envisioned
after
sniffing
imperial
pilsner
would
be
one
of
my
last
guesses
for
this
beer
blind
nutty
grainy
and
light
toffee
flavors
lead
the
way
with
a
floral
hop
bitterness
on
the
finish
alcohol
helps
dry
things
out
as
well
yeast
is
not
quite
as
boastful
as
an
ale
but
is
assuredly
more
notable
than
most
lagers
interesting
beer
has
a
decently
enjoyable
malthop
interplay
and
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
smooth
dont
think
of
this
as
an
imperial
pilsner
and
youll
probably
enjoy
the
quaff
sip
after
sip
begins
with
a
strong
gain
flavor
along
with
some
hop
bitterness
this
feels
a
little
heavy
and
to
me
a
bit
sweet
the
alc
was
hidden
when
i
first
started
the
bomber
but
once
this
warms
some
it
gets
more
of
a
bite
one
of
the
most
enjoyable
parts
of
this
was
the
finish
i
like
the
hop
dryness
and
the
light
oil
like
coating
on
the
tounge
this
was
fairly
drinkable
and
a
nice
shot
at
the
style
the
taste
was
not
as
hoppy
as
i
had
surmised
from
the
nose
there
is
the
grassy
bitterness
accompanied
by
some
onion
to
me
this
beer
tasted
like
plain
potato
chips
a
lot
there
was
also
a
lot
of
nuttiness
to
it
that
wasnt
balanced
that
well
with
the
hops
mouthfeel
was
crazy
dry
way
too
much
and
tacky
overall
i
think
this
was
a
fail
in
the
to
thee
series
i
really
enjoyed
the
bb
winter
warmer
and
the
snowmageddon
was
decent
but
this
one
didnt
do
it
for
me
my
very
first
imperial
pilsner
im
really
enjoying
it
very
good
beer
the
beer
pours
an
orangeamber
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
heavy
on
the
bread
with
some
grassy
hops
the
flavor
is
more
of
the
same
i
get
some
low
bitterness
from
the
grassy
and
earthy
hops
as
well
as
some
toffee
and
bready
malt
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
not
as
good
as
the
last
two
releases
bourbon
barrel
winter
warmer
and
snowmageddon
opinion
i
was
really
wanting
to
like
this
beer
i
like
the
rahr
group
but
i
have
been
out
of
the
loop
for
a
couple
years
so
i
dont
know
if
mark
and
fritz
are
still
calling
the
shots
there
if
so
this
beer
is
falling
short
imho
at
least
the
carbonation
needs
to
be
higher
but
it
really
seems
like
there
is
something
off
with
both
the
water
and
the
mash
schedule
on
this
one
not
to
mention
the
fact
that
the
bittering
is
really
high
which
almost
indicates
a
longer
boil
than
intended
or
something
i
will
drink
my
whole
glass
but
i
wont
go
back
to
this
one
unless
i
know
that
there
was
some
major
process
change
to
improve
the
drinkability
and
to
a
lesser
extent
the
flavor
pours
a
clear
amber
color
with
a
foamy
light
tan
head
that
fades
into
a
nice
lace
nose
is
a
bit
subdued
but
there
are
notes
of
spicy
hops
there
are
notes
of
sweet
honey
malt
in
the
taste
though
this
is
overpowered
by
an
earthy
mineral
quality
as
well
as
a
very
pronounced
bitterness
the
hops
do
not
provide
much
in
the
way
of
fruity
citrus
or
spicy
flavors
but
rather
just
a
strong
bitterness
leading
to
a
very
dry
finish
an
interesting
beer
and
certainly
worth
a
try
this
beer
is
not
for
everyone
overall
impression
a
very
dry
very
embittered
beer
overall
i
found
it
just
a
touch
harsh
between
the
bittering
hops
and
a
noticeable
alcohol
flavor
that
said
it
was
well
made
just
not
quite
my
personal
cup
of
tea
i
learned
they
only
made
100
kegs
and
there
are
only
about
33
left
you
might
want
to
hurry
if
you
want
a
sample
they
werent
sure
they
were
going
to
make
this
one
again
sampled
at
its
debut
at
the
fort
worth
flying
saucer
with
the
1st
anniversary
pilsner
logo
glass
no
plans
to
bottle
in
the
immediate
future
but
that
could
change
if
it
is
wellreceived
it
will
probably
be
a
fall
annual
in
any
case
