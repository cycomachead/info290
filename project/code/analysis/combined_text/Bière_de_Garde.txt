not
a
style
i
usually
enjoy
im
enjoying
it
even
more
due
to
that
fact
a
very
good
beer
speaking
of
times
this
is
good
times
a
pleasant
bottle
to
share
with
friends
and
also
inspires
a
foodcheese
pairing
good
times
good
times
o
go
get
this
worth
the
price
of
admission
i
think
this
crushes
its
ultimate
predecessor
petrus
its
so
smooth
and
refreshing
wonderful
for
a
summer
day
the
abv
is
a
little
surprising
at
7
5
it
comes
across
as
less
im
not
sure
the
precise
relationship
between
jp
and
leelanu
but
they
have
a
very
similar
yeast
profile
gots
to
love
the
dexter
microbes
overall
very
good
i
was
expecting
a
mild
sourness
but
it
is
actually
quite
potent
it
works
well
from
the
bottle
at
meridian
pint

fruity
and
tart
with
a
bit
of
body
really
exceptional
and
super
smooth
for

amazing
beer
that
i
was
absolutely
stunned
by
750

and
fluffy
bright

head
with
great
retention
that
reduces
to
a
small

that
lingers
nice
spotty

that
is

nice
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
with
only
a
slight
warming
noticed
after
the

overall
this
is
an
absolutely
incredible
barrel
aged
wild
golden
ale
huge
complexity
and
balance
of
tart
fruity
spicy
and
funk
notes
and
very
smooth
to
sip
on
a
highly
fantastic
offering
as
the
carbonation
died
out
because
of
the
gusher
it
became
slightly
harder
to
drink
but
with
full
carbonation
this
was
absolutely
insane
a
great
surprise
something
i
have
passed
over
a
lot
but
glad
i
got
to
try
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
goblet
a
cloudy
golden
yellow
with
a
fluffy
white
head
that
receded
to
a
wispy
layer
minimal
lacing
aroma
of
earth
and
barnyard
funk
notes
of
grains
and
light
fruits
taste
follows
the
aroma
with
flavors
of
grass
and
funk
woody
grainy
light
fruits
and
distant
peppery
spice
lightmedium
mouthfeel
a
little
stale
in
the
aftertaste
but
nothing
offensive
nice
overall
it
pours
a
light
bodied
very
cloudy
almost
belgian
wit
gold
in
color
with
a
soapy
one
finger
head
the
nose
is
phenomenal
it
is
slightly
tart
with
a
white
orchard
fruit
type
subtle
sweetness
there
is
just
a
soft
touch
of
butter
the
flavors
are
both
sweet
and
tart
it
has
some
pear
and
white
apple
characteristics
and
finishes
with
a
good
amount
of
brett
its
just
a
really
well
balanced
sour
it
drinks
a
about
medium
in
body
with
adequate
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
really
nice
and
easy
drinking
sour
i
love
the
fruit
characteristics
with
the
right
amount
of
tartness
this
is
a
really
nice
beer
nice
beer
very
refreshing
and
i
need
to
have
more
overall
nice
barrel
treatment
this
shows
how
you
can
integrate
a
biere
de
garde
with
a
barrel
to
create
a
very
tasty
brew
i
just
wish
i
was
a
millionaire
so
i
could
buy
cases
upon
cases
well
i
guess
i
can
dream
d
4
5
o
an
easy
drinker
and
a
great
beer
as
biere
de
gardes
go
its
not
as
malty
as
most
its
been
a
while
but
i
want
to
compare
it
to
les
bière
des
sans
culottes
its
nearing
something
of
a
saison
i
had
an
initial
concern
with
the
sticker
shock
creating
disappointment
but
all
was
relieved
at
13
50
for
a
750ml
it
would
be
more
of
a
special
occasion
beer
than
every
day
drinker
it
was
great
on
an
unseasonably
warm
january
afternoon
blue
skies
and
temps
somewhere
around
40
it
could
be
a
nice
summer
treat
on
the
deck
with
the
grill
fired
up
bottle
not
cheap
at
about
18bottle
pours
a
slightly
hazed
light
golden
color
with
a
slight
white
head
some

nice
nose
lemon
zest
and
some
caramel
mediumlight
mouthfeel
lemon
and
pineapple
off
the
bat
some
oaky
notes
in
the
back
end
lingering
chardonnay
like
flavor
decent
but
not
sure
if
it
is
worth
the
cost
good
carbonation
controllable
gushing
nice
funkiness
i
liked
this
beer
quite
a
bit
another
great
one
from
jeffries
overall
a
fun
beer
to
be
shared
amongst
friends
after
a
hot
day
very
refreshing
fun
different
taste
which
was
a
nice
break
from
the
complex
and
heavy
beers
i
have
recently
been
discovering
thank
you
leelanau
brewing
company
keep
up
the
great
work
overall
this
is
an
enjoyable
brew
and
i
would
be
interested
to
try
their
other
offerings
this
is
big
enough
to
keep
me
interested
but
light
enough
to
be
refreshing
in
the
summer
o
a
very
enjoyable
beer
from
a
very
under
appreciated
brewery
id
like
to
grab
some
more
of
these
to
see
how
they
age
overall
very
nice
beer
perfect
amount
of
sour
any
more
and
itd
be
difficult
to
drink
overall
a
great
summer
beer
i
have
had
this
beer
many
times
i
dont
believe
i
caught
this
one
in
its
prime
but
still
showing
really
good
for
34
years
old
first
sip
is
nice
and
clean
the
sour
nature
is
also
a
little
less
than
other
sour
beers
that
are
on
the
market
still
combined
with
the
excellent
body
and
drinkability
of
the
ale
i
cant
find
any
reason
not
to
fall
in
love
with
it
its
a
nice
brew
very
interesting
but
nothing
extraordinary
drinkability
this
is
the
first
biere
de
garde
i
have
enjoyed
and
i
attribute
it
to
good
brewing
and
microbes
i
would
definitely
drink
this
again
excellent
beer
highly
drinkable
slightly
too
easy
to
enjoy
the
alcohol
is
masterfully
disguised
i
would
not
guess
that
this
was
7
5
the
price
point
is
very
nice
compared
to
similar
beers
though
a
bit
higher
than
i
will
pay
on
an
average
day
i
will
revisit
this
one
from
time
to
time
too
good
not
to
bomber
from
champagne
cellars
more
of
a
wild
ale
than
a
bierede
garde
as
the
spicyness
was
muted
the
aourness
fortunately
was
udner
great
control
and
accompanied
food
nicely
taste
grew
on
me
bottled
in
august
of
this
year
it
would
be
interesting
to
try
after
some
cellaring
good
amount
of
head
and
a
lace
lines
on
tap
at
the
mbgsf
pours
blonde
with
a
good
head
and
good
lace
the
aroma
is
earthy
fruity
and
funky
with
some
distinct
lemon
peel
and
some
hay
the
flavor
is
nicely
dry
and
earthy
and
slightly
but
nicely
sour
the
beer
reminds
me
a
good
bit
of
champagne
batch
dated
81210
picked
up
a
bottle
at
jolly
pumpkins
ann
arbor
location
clear
golden
pour
with
a
fine
white
head
the
nose
is
sour
barnyard

very
sour

ive
been
looking
for
a
bottle
of
this
since
reading
the
new
york
times
review
of
best
belgianstyle
beers
and
saw
it
listed
i
really
enjoy
jolly
pumpkins
beers
and
this
one
brewed
for
leelanau
is
no
exception
drinkabilitythis
is
quite
an
interesting
sour
beer
very
easy
to
drink
with
its
satisfying
full
mouthfeel
and
complexity
while
not
overpowering
you
with
its
alchohol
drinkability
extremely
so
i
know
this
brewery
is
somehow
related
or
deals
with
jolly
pumpkin
hence
my
picking
up
the
three
beers
they
offer
this
beer
to
be
honest
is
less
funky
than
i
was
expecting
in
comparison
to
say
the
bière
de
mars
from
jp
however
this
adds
to
its
drinkability
there
is
zero
showing
of
alcohol
and
i
am
restraining
myself
from
quaffing
this
fine
brew
i
cant
wait
to
try
the
other
two
offerings
from
leelanau
brewing
company
shocking
straw
golden
color
verging
on
sunkist
hows
that
for
a
technical
term
great
refreshing
tartness
but
has
a
sweet
citrus
side
that
reminds
me
of
ripe
grapefruit
if
you
are
a
fan
of
extreme
beers
or
big
in
your
face
fruit
flavors
its
worth
tracking
this
beer
down
i
would
argue
its
better
than
jolly
pumpkin
and
i
wish
it
had
wider
distribution
i
e
massachusetts
please
mouthfeel
was
fine
like
i
said
it
seemed
to
have
some
residual
sugar
which
definitely
gave
it
some
body
drinkability

biere

this
was
a
sour
ale
all
the
way
d
very
especially
on
a
summer
day
if
other
versions
are
just
as
funky
this
is
a
better
brew
than
my
feeble
review
can
come
across
but
this
is
interesting
and
i
am
damn
glad
i
have
a
good
guy
across
town
who
lets
me
try
thanks
eric
very
fizzy
and
a
bit
aggressive
on
the
tongue
not
as
smooth
as
the
other
two
leelanaus
before
but
still
very
decent
for
the
style
probably
the
best
deal
out
of
the
3
leelanau
beers
only
13
or
so
for
a
750ml
of
this
pretty
good
stuff
dtart
and
dry
with
a
pleasant
not
overpowering
sourness
this
is
a
very
nicely
done
brew
with
champagne
qualities
i
would
gladly
seek
this
out
again
d
this
is
about
as
good
as
it
gets
for
me
i
cant
even
begin
to
describe
how
wonderful
of
a
brew
this
is
this
brew
is
a
boon
to
the
esoteric
beer
drinker
its
complexity
is
so
enchanting
and
beguiling
and
every
sip
is
unique
i
love
to
pair
beer
with
food
but
this
brew
is
too
good
to
drink
with
any
food
just
put
on
some
good
music
sit
back
enjoy
every
sip
and
enjoy
life
this
is
my
first
time
trying
any
of
leelanaus
beers
not
sure
why
i
havant
picked
up
any
of
there
beers
off
the
shelf
in
the
past
but
here
it
goes
pours
a
bright
golden
color
with
a
two
finger
fizzy
white
head
that
fizzles
down
much
smaller
in
size
and
leaves
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
smells
of
wheat
and
big
citrus
flavors
the
taste
is
extremely
tart
followed
by
oak
flavors
apple
grapefruit
and
lemon
flavors
the
mouthfeel
is
high
in
carbonation
and
right
on
target
for
the
style
drinkability
is
high
goes
down
easy
i
could
drink
this
one
all
night
this
is
probably
my
favorite
beer
that
ive
stumbled
upon
over
the
past
few
years
had
this
several
times
at
the
spuyten
duyvil
on
a
trip
to
new
york
last
summer
and
luckily
got
another
chance
thanks
to
a
trade
w
vrazionale
shared
on
the
stoop
with
the
lady
at
the
end
of
a
long
hot
day
pours
a
beautiful
vibrant
golden
almost
florescent
looking
slightly
hazed
healthy
twofinger
head
receding
slowly
into
a
creamy
covering
layer
the
nose
is
full
of
oak
and
funky
citrus
zest
lemonlime
sour
apple
orange
zest
and
a
nice
woodsyness
reminiscent
of
the
finest
gueuze
belgium
has
to
offer
first
sip
is
like
stepping
into
the
past
maybe
thats
because
im
reminded
of
the
good
times
i
had
when
last
drinking
this
beer
but
it
also
has
that
old
world
rustic
farmhouse
vibe
to
it
initially
tart
giving
way
to
loads
of
complexities
funky
bugs
musty
earthy
dusty
spicy
slightly
floral
and
a
subtle
herbal
hop
profile
and
passive
pale
malt
and
then
lots
of
citrus
familiar
lemon
rind
but
also
a
deeper
juicyness
to
it
im
getting
notes
of
fresh
squeezed
oj
here
pineapple
maybe
as
it
warms
im
almost
reminded
of
gatorade
an
artificial
flavor
indeed
which
amazes
as
this
beer
is
of
course
all
natural
despite
a
lot
of
acidity
and
a
wrenching
dry
finish
this
beer
is
somehow
extremely
refreshing
truly
an
artisan
product
will
search
this
one
out
on
my
travels
again
and
again
supple
and
delicious
drinkability
is
pretty
pour
a
complex
sour
and
wild
ale
i
enjoy
but
this
one
is
tasting
acrid
and
overdone
with
the
acidity
and
oak
barrel
notes
creating
an
experience
that
i
would
not
like
to
relive
anytime
soon
i
love
all
of
the
beers
from
jolly
pumpkin
and
ron
jefferies
however
this
one
did
miss
the
mark
for
me
i
still
blame
the
green
bottles
this
was
contract
brewed
at
jolly
pumpkin
and
id
have
to
say
it
may
be
my
favorite
of
all
their
brews
a
good
clean
crisp
beer
with
a
simple
malt
base
that
lets
the
critters
do
their
thing
a
wonderful
showcase
for
the
brett
dosed
barrels
this
was
the
first
that
i
had
heard
of
this
beer
or
the
brewer
and
was
most
surprised
a
golden
ale
jazzed
up
with
some
yeasties
and
oakaging
this
kept
the
funky
feel
to
a
tasty
but
not
overdone
minimun
and
stayed
relatively
quaffable
thanks
again
for
the
chance
at
this
joe
d
i
found
this
to
be
a
very
good
golden
ale
with
a
pleasant
sour
character
courtesy
of
the
oak
aging
this
was
my
first
experience
with
this
brewery
and
overall
i
was
impressed
thick
white
head
on
pour
that
dropped
to
nothing
within
a
minute
fast
carbonation
flowing
up
through
a
golden
transparent
body
smell
is
gueze
like
sour
tart
just
like
the
taste
wow
i
wasnt
expecting
this
when
i
got
it
or
opened
it
tasty
mouth
fill
is
good
drinkabilty
is
good
i
like
this
brew
great
to
have
an
american
craft
brewery
that
produces
a
great
sour
like
this
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
fairly
strong
carbonation
pours
a
pretty
hazy
golden
yellow
hue
with
a
quite
one
finger
bright
white
head
that
dies
down
to
a
paper
thin
layer
which
lasts
throughout
just
about
nothing
in
terms
of
webbing
aroma
is
pretty
grassy
with
lemon
corn
and
wheat
tart
granny
smith
apples
and
some
pear
in
the
nose
as
well
taste
has
the
before
mentioned
sour
fruits
with
some
grains
and
crips
hay
popcorn
oak
vanilla
and
a
touch
of
vinegar
midway
with
a
puckering
lemongrass
aftertaste
light
and
refreshing
body
with
a
crazy
crisp
feel
from
the
extremely
active
carbonation
the
overall
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
really
leaves
you
begging
for
more
very
champagneesque
for
how
big
of
a
bottle
this
was
and
the
very
undetectable
7
5
i
had
no
problem
finishing
this
bad
boy
myself
this
beer
was
quite
the
surprise
id
love
to
see
what
a
few
years
would
do
to
this
beauty
thanks
joe
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
brew
i
wouldnt
really
characterize
it
as
a
bier
de
garde
but
many
of
jolly
pumpkins
style
designations
are
by
inspiration
only
anyway
still
this
is
quite
a
tasty
brew
one
which
i
am
happily
quaffing
this
doesnt
seem
to
have
anything
beyond
a
normal
belgian
yeast
strain
funkiness
to
it
despite
the
notes
in
the
nose
though
it
is
certainly
a
characterful
strain
at
the
very
least
pretty
damn
tasty
on
a
hot
summers
eve
pours
clear
golden
sunshine
amber
with
just
a
light
threequarters
ring
of
foam
some
faint
lacing
and
pretty
good
bubbling
the
aroma
has
a
note
of
malt
vinegar
with
some
very
tart
bananas
the
taste
is
a
toasty
champagne
with
some
aged
orange
peel
and
granny
smith
apples
pretty
tart
palate
with
some
mixed
tart
fruits
almost
malt
vinegary
although
at
12
49
it
seemed
a
tad
inflated
for
what
it
is
if
this
is
really
going
for
20
at
bierkraft
ive
got
a
bridge
to
sell
you
drinkability
a
little
overboard
on
the
sourness
but
a
very
nice
first
effort
mouthfeel
has
the
right
feel
oak
vanilla
comes
through
have
some
more
maybe
nice
overall
excellent
beer
but
i
cant
help
but
feel
that
its
quite
a
bit
overcarbonated
pours
a
foggy
straw
with
a
thin
off
white
head
nose
is
a
good
level
of
funky
that
carries
an
almost
lambic
kind
of
nose
at
first
slight
fruit
tone
dies
off
to
a
more
earthy
and
subdued
woody
character
flavor
brings
a
severe
complexity
the
first
thing
i
think
is
cheese
most
specifically
brie
why
bother
picking
up
half
a
pound
at
the
bedford
cheese
shop
when
you
can
get
it
here
actually
it
just
makes
me
want
to
take
a
bite
out
of
some
hunk
of
cheesy
goodness
great
thinner
mild
fruit
tones
body
is
very
nice
smooth
carbonation
on
a
consistent
liquid
body
extremely
drinkable
i
dont
usually
like
this
style
but
this
is
good
definitely
unique
the
most
memorable
beer
i
have
had
in
quite
some
time
the
first
thought
that
came
to
mind
when
drinking
was
jolly
pumpkin
artisan
ales
and
belgium
real
nice
stuff
ive
been
really
getting
into
the
open
fermentation
style
lately
those
wild
yeasts
are
so
lively
with
the
whole
oak
barrel
aged
thing
i
wondered
if
the
barrels
previously
held
white
wine
as
that
is
what
it
reminded
me
most
of
beyond
dang
good
beer
good
harbor
golden
ale
is
a
wonderful
creation
that
can
hold
its
head
high
in
the
company
of
all
but
the
very
best
belgian
and
french
bieres
de
garde
its
tailormade
to
be
enjoyed
on
a
bright
summer
day
under
a
shade
tree
with
a
ploughmans
lunch
and
someone
special
someone
who
also
appreciates
good
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
very
nicely
carbonated
and
goes
down
easy
i
stumbled
across
this
one
and
didnt
quite
know
what
to
expect
but
im
glad
i
found
it
this
is
really
something
worth
trying
i
wouldnt
suggest
letting
it
pass
you
by
tart
acidic
fruits
up
front
hay
and
faint
tropical
fruit
sweetness
follow
with
a
nearbiscuity
malt
backbone
citrus
sorbet
explodes
into
the
tartish
dry
bitterish
refreshing
finish
medium
body
with
a
soft
smooth
feel
underneath
rolling
bottleconditioned
carbonation
very
drinkable
and
damn
good
im
excited
for
this
brewery
and
wish
them
luck
on
their
forthcoming
facility
in
the
meantime
you
cant
go
wrong
with
having
ron
at
jp
helping
out
the
energy
and
substance
of
this
beer
is
revealed
by
a
rising
column
of
foam
from
the
neck
of
a
freshly
opened
bottle
it
pours
very
pale
and
clear
yellow
aromas
of
marsh
grass
and
moldy
lemon
peels
a
dry
herbal
attack
of
lemon
and
grapefruit
is
supported
by
slick
muscular
texture
very
tart
bitter
finish
bubblegum
powder
stitches
chipped
basement
rocks
to
yellow
leather
flavors
begs
to
be
served
with
grassy
alpine
cheeses
kraut
and
organ
meats
overall
impression
a
light
refreshing
funky
frenchstyle
ale
not
my
cup
of
tea
but
well
done
drinkability
suffers
a
bit
for
me
due
to
the
sourness
not
overdone
but
12
oz
would
go
along
way
for
me
let
alone
750
mls
d
the
beer
is
quite
refreshing
and
would
live
up
to
its
purpose
according
to
the
bottle
of
drinking
on
the
beach
the
complexity
and
the
sourness
keeps
you
begging
for
more
all
together
a
great
beer
to
quench
my
thirst
today
i
didnt
know
what
to
expect
from
this
brew
as
it
was
my
first
biere
de
garde
and
this
is
only
its
second
review
but
i
was
really
impressed
i
cant
imagine
a
much
better
example
of
the
style
amazing
beer
especially
for
such
a
small
brewery
id
never
heard
of
before
definitely
worth
seeking
out
this
leelanau
offering
the
mouth
is
spritzy
and
tart
yet
in
no
way
light
a
very
complex
and
flavorful
beer
that
makes
you
want
more
and
the
abv
allows
for
indulgence
o
represents
the
biere
de
garde
style
very
well
o
pretty
plain
biere
de
garde
nice
sweet
maltiness
to
it
but
thats
about
it
fairly
one
note
quite
smooth
tasty
and
drinkable
however
i
tried
to
be
fair
on
the
ratings
im
guessing
this
is
old
given
the
stale
hops
flavor
and
the
huge
amount
of
floaties
shame
on
the
brewerdistributor
for
not
dating
their
bottles
however
750
ml
bottle
into
tulip
glass
no
bottle
dating
seriously
massive
never
ending
gusher
here
upon
opening
pours
extremely
cloudy
orange
copper
color
with
a
12
finger
fairly
dense
and
fluffy
offwhite
head
with
good
retention
that
reduces
to
a
small
cap
that
lingers
spotty
foamy
lacing
clings
on
the
glass
aromas
of
big
caramel
pear
apple
grape
honey
floral
herbal
clove
pepper
bread
and
herbal
earthiness
very
nice
aromas
with
good
balance
and
complexity

taste
of
caramel

and
herbal
earthiness
lingering
notes
of
caramel
light
fruits
honey
bread
floral
herbal
clove
pepper
and
earthiness
on
the
finish
for
a
good
bit
fantastic
balance
and
complexity
of
malt
and
fruityspicy
ester
flavors
with
moderate
hop
earthiness
and
zero
cloying
flavors
after
the
finish
mediumhigh
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
with
a
fairly
slick
and
moderately
crisp
mouthfeel
that
is
nice
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
with
hardly
any
warming
noticed
after
the
finish
overall
this
is
a
highly
excellent
biere
de
garde
style
all
around
great
balance
and
complexity
of
malt
with
fruityspicy
esters
and
hop
flavors
and
extremely
smooth
to
drink
a
highly
enjoyable
offering
o
this
is
an
extremely
satisfying
beer
it
provides
a
great
bready
quality
that
mixes
with
a
mild
caramel
sweetness
and
a
phenolic
clove
and
nutmeg
character
beer
is
of
medium
weight
with
carbonation
of
mediumlight
intensity
creating
a
closes
quite
dry
with
light
stickiness
lingering
on
the
palate
which
is
pleasing
with
the
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
to
be
enjoyed
with
a
ripe
cheese
o
this
beer
would
really
pair
well
with
just
amount
any
meal
it
is
very
tasty
and
well
balanced
yet
still
light
i
could
have
drank
this
beer
throughout
the
entire
meal
and
been
happy
very
inviting
aroma
o
not
quite
up
with
the
greater
ones
this
is
just
slightly
better
than
a
standard
biere
de
garde
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
of
a
lessthanpopular
style
in
the
u
s
a
maltbomb
but
not
a
sickly
sweet
one
very
drinkable
although
the
alcohol
was
a
little
strong
for
the
abv
pours
a
copperamber
color
with
a
twofinger
offwhite
head
with
some
great
lacing
and
a
thin
collar
throughout
the
nose
carries
a
good
dosing
of
bread
crust
and
amber
malt
slight
caramel
and
earth
slight
bit
of
pepper
flavor
is
quite
similar
but
a
bit
more
tame
and
more
toward
the
malt
could
use
a
bit
more
yeast
medium
chewy
body
with
good
carbonation
quite
nice
and
far
preferable
to
the
blonde
thanks
schmittymack
again
poured
a
cloudy
yellowamber
with
a
minimal
amount
of
white
foam
aromas
of
brown
spices
black
pepper
and
belgian
yeast
on
the
palate
this
one
is
somewhat
spicy
and
light
to
medium
bodied
with
flavors
of
belgian
candi
sugar
brown
spices
pepper
and
yeast
tasty
and
satisfying
but
wish
the
malt
backbone
had
not
become
so
pushy
la
bavaisienne
pours
somewhere
between
a
light
brown
and
a
dark
orange
and
its
completely
hazy
theres
a
solid
three
fingers
plus
of
bone
white
head
that
slowly
creeps
down
the
glass
leaving
plenty
of
footprints
behind
the
nose
is
redolent
of
apples
and
herbs
and
caramel
it
smells
like
some
kind
of
apple
cider
that
was
sweetened
up
a
bit
with
caramel
syrup
the
flavor
sees
the
caramel
notes
take
a
bit
of
a
backseat
to
apples
and
general
fruity
notes
on
the
sweet
side
the
earthyherbal
notes
are
also
a
bit
more
prominent
the
beer
tastes
like
walking
through
an
apple
orchard
on
a
farm
the
body
is
beguilingly
light
for
how
prominent
the
maltysweet
flavors
are
in
this
beer
the
carbonation
is
just
about
perfectly
dialed
in
enough
to
cut
through
the
sweet
flavors
of
the
beer
and
place
some
emphasis
on
the
herbal
notes
but
still
doesnt
distract
from
the
rest
of
the
beer
la
bavaisienne
is
a
great
example
of
a
style
i
dont
drink
all
that
often
and
its
a
beer
ill
look
to
come
back
to
in
the
future
o
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
an
excellent
representation
of
the
style
i
will
definitely
be
trying
this
again
because
it
tastes
very
good
i
have
to
try
it
freshernon
light
struck
next
time
hard
when
they
insist
on
the
green
bottle
d
a
nice
somewhat
complex
sipper
split
this
with
a
several
friends
on
a
lazy
sunday
afternooon
and
they
were
unimpressed
personally
i
thought
it
was
interesting
but
i
cant
say
that
i
would
buy
it
again
or
that
it
was
particularly
tasty
but
i
may
be
ignorant
to
the
style
it
was
dark
amber
and
smelled
grainy
taste
was
grainy
amber
belgian
and
reminded
me
of
caracole
amber
overall
not
bad
but
not
impressed
i
admit
that
i
dont
care
for
biere
de
garde
nearly
as
much
as
i
care
for
saison
biere
de
garde
always
seems
less
complex
less
farmhouse
ale
to
me
it
is
like
the
farms
of
france
all
got
together
and
decided
in
the
face
of
bewilderingly
complex
belgian
saison
that
they
would
all
brew
something
a
lot
like
rare
vos
that
said
i
have
had
better
biers
de
garde
than
la
bavaisienne
chalk
this
one
up
as
a
disappointment
solid
beer
though
it
is
this
has
been
and
continues
to
be
one
of
my
all
time
favs
pours
with
nice
foamy
frothy
light
tan
head
that
mostly
settles
down
and
not
much
lace
this
time
color
is
a
very
slightly
hazy
medium
amber
aroma
is
yeast
malt
a
little
hop
spice
flavors
like
aroma
and
i
pick
up
a
short
sour
tang
in
the
front
and
then
again
just
a
bit
at
the
end
body
is
excellent
with
carbonation
that
perfectly
compliments
the
rest
of
the
beer
satisfying
yet
very
easy
drinking
session
this
beer
smells
like
boiling
wort
and
tastes
a
little
like
unfermenter
wort
in
spite
of
this
its
tasty
it
has
a
nice
bitter
hop
and
toasty
malt
aroma
it
has
a
complex
and
nicely
balanced
set
of
flavors
hoppier
than
other
beiere
de
gardes
ive
had
but
still
primarily
malty
d
moderate
interesting
easy
enough
to
drink
had
me
scratching
my
head
the
caramel
sweetness
and
the
earthy
malts
are
an
interesting
combo
ok
feel
great
drinkability
pleasant
flavor
toasty
caramel
malts
and
fruity
from
the
biere
de
garde
yeast
soft
and
a
little
mellow
from
age
some
typical
oxidized
belgian
character
that
keeps
it
from
being
great
minor
earthy
hop
flavor
in
the
aftertaste
lending
some
needed
bitterness
the
full
body
is
supported
by
ample
carbonation
it
seems
to
have
held
up
for
awhile
ok
but
i
cant
say
the
aging
has
benefitted
it
out
of
a
750ml
capped
and
foiled
bottle
pours
a
pretty
honey
brown
color
with
a
big
foamy
white
head
that
clinged
against
the
side
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
lemon
and
green
apple
skins
some
farmhouse
funk
mineral
water
and
caramel
nice
earthy
caramel
malt
flavor
some
honey
sweetness
followed
by
a
metallic
note
some
light
farmhouse
flavors
peak
through
and
ends
with
a
grassy
hop
bitterness
moderate
body
with
plenty
of
carbonation
sweet
overall
but
finishes
with
bitter
bite
a
little
sticky
this
is
a
very
good
biere
de
garde
it
just
tastes
like
a
craft
beer
nice
art
work
on
the
bottle
highly
recommended
d
decent
drinkability
i
enjoyed
this
but
not
sure
id
seek
it
out
again
nice
have
this
with
your
typical
western
holiday
fare
turkey
and
stuffing
especially
if
your
stuffing
is
wellseasoned
and
particularly
if
it
uses
sage
pours
a
woody
brown
with
a
silky
tan
head
the
nose
features
an
earthy
bouquet
of
bready
malts
honey
ripe
fruits
and
peppery
yeasts
the
taste
is
also
on
the
sweet
side
but
well
balanced
no
real
funk
or
sour
presence
to
speak
of
not
super
complex
but
a
tasty
ale
indeed
the
medium
body
is
well
carbonated
but
perhaps
a
bit
thin
nice
classic
example
of
the
style
d
fairly
easy
to
drink
but
definitely
richer
than
the
average
bier
de
garde
nice
great
happy
looking
offwhite
head
greets
the
eye
lasts
to
a
nice
film
of
foam
atop
a
very
dark
rusty
amber
you
can
only
see
the
bubbling
at
the
bottom
of
the
glass
or
on
the
edges
of
the
beer
very
hazey
this
beer
looks
awesome
very
inviting
toasted
melba
toast
malts
mixed
with
some
soft
rosemary
and
thyme
maybe
some
caramel
notes
in
the
nose
as
well
the
taste
starts
with
mild
toasted
barely
and
a
grain
palate
this
slowly
develops
to
a
much
sweeter
malt
bill
caramel
and
some
honey
do
the
waltz
with
mildy
herbal
hops
tastes
like
a
european
field
in
spring
at
about
7
a
m
leaves
a
toasted
caramel
aftertaste
in
the
mouth
great
yeast
profile
gives
notes
of
fresh
fruit
still
on
the
vine
drinkability
is
good
this
is
one
brawny
bière
de
garde
full
flavored
but
damn
smooth
its
going
down
way
too
fast
that
massive
head
is
really
genius
as
id
otherwise
have
gulped
this
bottled
down
in
like
20
mins
perfect
pairing
with
this
thick
spicy
chili
although
after
that
was
gone
the
robustness
of
the
flavor
slowed
me
down
some
still
what
a
table
bière
this
would
be
perfect
for
a
holiday
meal
with
turkey
or
other
game
birds
i
have
to
tell
ya
i
have
really
enjoyed
the
handful
of
french
country
ales
i
have
hadi
like
the
fact
they
are
not
dominanted
by
funk
like
alot
of
their
northern
neighbors
beers
of
the
same
ilk
poured
into
an
oversized
wine
glass
a
hazed
brown
mixed
with
a
bit
of
deep
orange
a
thick
frothy
slight
off
white
head
that
left
two
rings
as
it
settled
into
a
creamy
mass
a
mix
of
leafy
and
spicey
hop
and
buttery
toffee
with
a
hint
of
iron
in
the
nosethe
flavors
just
meld
great
togetherthey
start
out
with
a
toffee
and
slight
chocolate
element
then
glides
into
a
leafy
slightly
earthy
finish
this
beer
is
refined
in
my
mind
and
oh
so
easy
to
drinka
real
fine
beer
to
sit
and
savor
i
wish
there
were
more
biere
de
garde
style
beer
to
choose
from
here
in
the
u
s
d
solid
beer
drink
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
could
definitely
enjoy
a
few
more
glasses
of
these
bottle
courtesy
of
turdfurgeson
poured
a
deep
slightly
hazy
brown
color
ale
with
huge
white
foamy
head
with
some
good
retention
and
some
good
lacing
taste
of
deep
malt
with
some
balance
sweetness
and
some
spicy
yeast
body
is
full
with
some
great
carbonation
and
no
alcohol
could
be
detected
lots
of
character
with
a
nice
creamy
body
the
balance
in
this
beer
is
just
incredible
i
would
love
to
try
this
again
ddefinitely
an
interesting
brew
there
is
a
certain
aged
quality
to
it
that
i
am
enjoying
and
the
complexities
are
keeping
my
minnd
occupied
this
reminds
me
of
a
dak
basement
in
a
good
way
the
beer
was
an
attractive
red
color
with
cumulus
cloud
head
composed
of
consistentlysized
tiny
bubbles
however
i
detected
no
aroma
at
all
flavorwise
i
got
some
malty
sweetness
balanced
with
more
hops
than
i
expected
the
one
real
redeeming
feature
of
this
beer
still
i
ddint
feel
there
was
much
flavor
here
throw
on
a
rather
watery
mouthfeel
and
i
am
not
much
impressed
brasserie
theillier
is
a
small
french
brewery
located
a
stones
throw
from
the
belgian
border
that
produces
only
two
ales
as
far
as
i
know
even
though
la
bavaisienne
is
a
better
beer
than
la
bavaisienne
blonde
it
isnt
worldclass
by
any
means
a
more
forceful
personality
would
have
made
it
more
memorable
maybe
a
little
of
that
belgian
barnyard
funk
wouldnt
have
been
such
a
bad
idea
after
all
overall
excellent
example
though
too
expensive
to
be
a
session
bière
is
good
happy
bièreing
this
is
the
best
biere
de
garde
i
have
ever
had
it
is
dry
and
malty
with
the
hops
cleaning
your
palate
and
making
you
want
another
sip
very
little
of
the
yeasty
fruitiness
that
i
do
not
like
in
other
beers
of
this
style
smooth
mouthfeel
with
nothing
cloying
very
drinkable
and
i
suspect
this
goes
really
well
with
food
pours
lightlyclouded
chestnut
with
streaming
carbonation
very
persistent
thick
creamy
head
and
clinging
lace
smells
peppery
and
nutty
with
strong
bitter
orange
and
moist
earth
notes
the
aroma
is
interesting
but
not
immediately
appetizing
the
flavor
on
the
other
hand
is
completely
unexpected
and
out
of
this
world
deeply
toasted
biscuit
malts
exhibit
lovely
nutty
qualities
the
mediumsweet
malt
becomes
peppery
and
hoppy
at
the
end
finishing
with
orange
notes
and
yeasty
earthiness
the
taste
is
an
appealing
and
unusual
blend
of
british
esb
and
a
more
traditional
biere
de
garde
mediumthick
body
with
big
carbonation
and
balancing
creaminess
exceptionally
drinkable
and
wellworth
finding
overall
i
liked
this
beer
if
i
come
by
it
again
i
will
not
hesitate
to
get
a
bottle
or
two

750
ml
faint
champagne
apple
malts
dance
from
the
heavy
carbonation
of
this
beaut
really
not
getting
too
much
aroma
though
pour
of
beautiful
fired
amber
with
a
rocky
ivory
head
flavor
is
a
ridiculous
amalgam
of
sweet
full
grain
flavors
like
ive
rarely
experienced
theres
a
variety
of
farmlike
sweet
candy
grains
and
full
rounds
of
light
fruits
the
malts
are
especially
syrupy
feeling
but
the
beer
is
in
no
way
cloying
instead
a
gentle
swashing
of
freshly
roasted
grain
husks
and
tawny
edges
of
apple
brandy
its
damn
delicious
for
sure
the
yeast
character
seems
subdued
to
a
bready
faint
existence
despite
the
omnipresent
appearance
in
the
bottle
a
smidge
of
hop
dust
in
the
backend
draw
balanced
i
guess
overall
im
dissapointed
by
the
lack
of
aroma
but
extremely
satisfied
with
the
skillful
and
delicate
malting
of
this
beer
it
reaches
german
standards
and
is
a
beer
that
really
lets
these
malty
nuances
stand
and
shout
for
themselves
smoother
than
hell
too
i
could
see
how
people
might
think
this
is
bland
but
they
might
not
have
refined
palates

out

thats

quiet

for

is
this
one
or

an

still
with
good

wish
i
took
more
then
just
this
1

great
brew
imo
so
glad
to
have
tried
it
much
thanks
to
buckeyenation
drinkability
is
good
a
nice
malty
treat
with
nice
fruitiness
and
light

solid
contender

with

on

the

are
fairly
mellow
and
tame
until
the
midpalate
explodes
with
fresh

layers
of
velvety
flavors
a
work
of
art
as

as
biere

go
drinkability
and
notes

the
flavors
meld
well
and
aside
from
the
floaties
and
rusty
cap
it
was
good
beer
experience
drinkability
was
good
the
flavor
stayed
interesting
and
enjoyable
through
the
whole
bottle
this
was
my
first
imported
bier
de
garde
and
i
enjoyed
it
thoroughly
definitely
recommended
pours
out
reddish
brown
with
a
dense
offwhite
head
flecked
with
brown
chunks
the
aroma
is
caramel
honey
herbs
and
just
a
little
funkiness
the
flavor
is
suprisingly
malty
complex
malts
very
herbal
and
a
gentle
hop
spiciness
apples
and
figs
finishes
bitter
the
mouthfeel
is
so
full
and
creamy
incredibly
drinkable
this
beer
is
a
real
pleasure
to
drink
i
highly
recommend
it
bright
copper
with
a
huge
white
head
and
tons
of
streaming
bubbles
and
yeasty
lurkers
aroma
is
very
spicy
and
grassy
new
mown
hay
comes
to
mind
with
a
very
grainy
earthiness
that
balances
the
spicy
hops
very
well
tastes
just
like
the
nose
but
with
a
more
pronounced
grainy
malt
character
lots
of
noble
hops
very
yeasty
and
bready
a
hint
of
sweetness
just
before
a
dry
finish
medium
body
with
tons
of
carbonation
this
is
one
of
the
most
drinkable
and
refreshing
beers
ive
ever
had
well
balanced
and
the
750ml
bottle
was
just
the
right
quantity
light
beer
with
a
permanent
big
fluffy
head
spicy
aroma
and
taste
not
all
that
drinkable
and
thinmedium
mouthfeel
pepper
cloves
cardomaon
grassiness
and
hops
there
best
of
france
whatever
that
should
mean
still
drinkable
at
end
of
hot
summer
day
better
with
food
its
not
particularily
complex
but
whats
there
is
very
good
of
course
its
full
sticky
malt
does
deter
its
drinkability
a
bit
leaving
it
more
of
a
quiet
after
dinner
drink
than
a
pubtime
quaffer
otherwise
its
a
very
nicely
done
malty
and
strong
biere
de
garde
as
its
intended
for
storage
id
suggest
giving
this
one
at
least
a
few
months
in
the
cellar
to
bring
it
to
top
condition
all
this
talk
about
space
has
me
thinking
this
is
probably
as
complex
and
equally
complicated
to
interplanetary
travel
but
a
whole
lot
more
fun
if
i
ever
had
plan
of
becoming
an
astronaut
fuck
it
ill
just
stay
home
with
another
bottle
of
this
this
beer
is
all
over
the
place
and
so
completely
well
balanced
dashing
good
looks
inviting
nose
superb
taste
and
a
body
that
puts
it
all
out
cant
really
ask
for
more
well
i
could
ask
for
more
of
this
but
thats
about
it
truly
a
stunningly
good
beer
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
this
year
750
ml
green
capped
and
foil
sealed
bottle
this
is
a
biere
de
garde
if
it
were
a
slight
bit
more
malty
definitely
not
a
belgian
strong
more
likely
a
belgian
pale
ale
but
the
hop
levels
are
not
that
intense
in
any
case
a
well
crafted
beer
notes
this
is
one
of
the
featured
beers
in
phil
markowskis
southampton
publick
house
farmhouse
ales
book
its
listed
under
the
biere
de
garde
half
of
the
book
but
even
the
brasserie
thellier
brewer
doesnt
really
classify
it
as
a
biere
de
garde
deep
amber
and
clear
with
a
thick
eggshell
colored
creamy
head
ton
of
carbonation
rising
up
to
the
heavy
head
that
you
can
just
peak
through
richly
scented
caramel
malty
sweetly
floral
buttery
sugar
and
warmly
alcoholic
tightly
packed
carbonation
which
makes
the
body
feel
more
medium
feels
just
a
bit
too
foamy
for
my
tastes
very
dry
very
crisp
darkened
toast
bit
vineous
chardonnay
very
enjoyable
backwash
a
recent
ny
times
article
inspired
me
to
again
sample
through
some
of
the
bières
de
garde
i
hadnt
had
in
some
time
once
i
find
my
favorite
beer
in
a
category
i
tend
to
stick
with
it
but
the
article
and
the
disappearance
of
3
monts
from
nj
provided
a
great
opportunity
to
go
asearching
this
beer
is
one
of
the
classics
with
tremendous
flavor
and
complexity
i
consider
this
more
a
saisonbière
de
garde
than
a
belgian
strong
ale
and
put
this
near
the
top
of
that
category
surpassed
by
3
monts
southamptons
french
country
heavyweights
bière
darte
and
la
choulette
i
intend
to
revisit
many
of
these
classics
in
the
months
to
come
definitely
worth
seeking
out
and
still
a
great
value
one
of
those
beers
that
dares
you
to
buy
a
cheap
bottle
of
wine
drinkability
suffers
with
it
being
a
little
out
of
whack
with
too
much
sweetness
this
might
pair
well
with
something
containing
carmelized
onions
a
unique
and
charming
biere
de
garde
warming
soothing
and
satisfying
this
brings
peace
to
any
day
rich
without
being
presumptous
this
is
a
very
good
brew
and
is
highly
recommended
the
deep
amber
body
is
topped
by
a
voluminous
whipped
custard
head
that
clings
to
the
glass
for
dear
life
this
is
perhaps
the
maltiest
of
the
style
that
ive
had
to
date
with
rich
caramel
malts
providing
the
base
of
the
aroma
and
flavor
theres
a
good
bit
of
apple
peel
fruitiness
and
the
flavor
is
a
tad
sweet
the
only
thing
that
bugs
me
about
the
beers
is
a
slight
harshness
in
the
lingering
bitterness
of
the
finish
but
the
bitterness
seems
to
fade
as
i
drink
it
so
it
could
have
been
something
to
do
with
the
temperature
definitely
gets
better
as
it
warms
this
beer
shows
a
ligher
shade
of
scarlet
red
clarity
is
good
vigorous
carbonation
is
noted
and
a
huge
crop
of
off
white
head
impressive
looking
nose
is
interesting
some
funky
barnyard
and
horsey
aromas
though
not
as
strong
as
say
cantillon
musty
cellars
yeast
sediment
earthy
dirt
tones
herbal
pretty
good
while
this
beer
has
a
definite
dry
quality
to
it
theres
a
ghostly
sweet
aspect
that
is
very
alluring
the
beer
is
very
earthy
its
all
about
the
farmhouse
qualities
the
hay
the
barn
the
horse
blanket
its
not
real
acidic
or
tart
but
definitely
yeasty
and
musty
like
a
cellar
this
is
really
enjoyable
and
disappearing
way
too
fast
pours
clear
copper
in
appearance
with
a
rocky
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
malty
spicy
and
peppery
the
flavor
is
bready
and
malty
it
is
also
a
bit
sweet
and
has
a
light
fruitiness
the
body
is
medium
and
it
is
easy
drinking
a
very
tasty
brew
would
have
another
great
orangeamber
body
eternally
lasting
1inch
foam
very
deep
aroma
although
never
aggressive
makes
you
feels
like
youre
the
one
who
is
lucky
to
study
it
and
not
the
subject
that
is
lucky
to
be
studied
you
ar
lucky
to
smell
this
and
must
offer
proper
efforts
to
grasp
that
terrific
rusty
character
that
is
hard
to
pinpoint
but
offers
such
a
subtle
earthiness
to
compensate
those
wet
hay
flavours
and
mild
hops
that
seems
to
have
a
german
origin
as
unlikely
as
it
is
styrians
rather
complex
when
you
dig
it
with
the
perfect
level
of
sweetness
palate
is
a
killer
just
the
right
yeast
character
perfectly
peaking
through
the
copious
rustic
flavours

very
dry

one
that
has
you
sucking
your
tongue

highly
drinkable
splendid
spongy
texture
foamy
hiding
its
high
carbonation
through
an
unreal
quaffability
i
must
concur
with
the
general
opinion
that
this
thrones
the
bière
de
garde
stylebig
props
to
jpdipso
smells
damn
good
58f
beautiful

little

with
the
thinnest

a

some

alfalfa
strands
and
grass
ill
tell
you
what
i
could
drink
buckets
of
this
the
malt
hangs
around
the
palate
like
a
street
corner
quartet
providing
a
pleasant
buzz
to
the
proceedings
and
this
beer
proceeds
to
impress
me
with
layers
of
grassy
hops
and
im
gonna
love
you
malt
its
totally
relaxed
not
overtly
farmy
barmy
though
theres
a
little
of
that
mustiness
balanced
session
on
750ml
bottle
sampled
at
the
ctriver
brewers
festival
this
one
poured
an
orangishgolden
color
there
wasnt
a
lot
of
head
on
it
the
aroma
was
quite
nice
there
was
floral
notes
as
well
as
some
fruits
and
spiciness
the
taste
is
very
complex
and
has
a
dryness
and
spiciness
to
it
really
an
excellent
beer
hmm
judging
by
what
the
label
says
this
should
be
reclassified
as
a
biere
de
garde
so
ill
review
it
as
such
the
label
also
descrbes
la
bavaisienne
as
a
malty
hoppy
amber
ale
and
this
is
true
but
its
so
much
more
this
beer
pours
with
a
fine
bead
of
carbonation
and
lasting
head
of
bright
white
foam
an
aroma
of
new
mown
hay
bursts
forth
tinged
with
minerallike
notes
this
mineral
content
is
echoed
on
the
palate
his
mediumbodied
ale
has
a
soft
mouthfeel
despite
its
high
carbonation
i
would
go
so
far
to
describe
the
mouthfeel
as
being
quite
plush
this
ale
gets
a
bit
snappy
and
crisp
towards
this
finish
with
a
late
burst
of
lightly
spicy
hops
amid
honeybiscuit
malt
flavors
the
finish
is
fairly
dry
for
the
style
with
a
slight
bit
sweetness
left
on
the
tongue
an
exceptional
biere
de
garde
or
strong
pale
ale
whichever
you
want
to
call
it
pours
a
pretty
clear
copper
color
it
is
well
carbonated
and
supports
a
prodigious
tan
head
the
aroma
is
sharp
and
spicy
with
some
herbal
notes
as
well
as
some
malty
ones
too
the
aroma
is
a
good
marriage
between
malt
hops
and
yeast
aromatics
my
first
impression
of
the
taste
is
that
this
definitely
hits
the
spot
it
is
light
and
flavorful
perfect
for
a
hot
summer
evening
this
has
some
nice
sharp
spicy
notes
that
hit
the
front
of
my
tongue
these
are
a
nice
balance
to
the
malty
sweetness
that
is
also
found
in
this
beer
the
malty
sweetness
has
a
depth
of
flavor
which
really
contributes
to
the
overall
character
of
this
beer
i
get
flavor
notes
that
are
spicy
herbal
sweet
and
a
certain
caramel
maltiness
while
i
would
be
hesitant
to
call
this
a
stellar
beer
the
integrated
flavors
really
meld
very
well
together
this
is
certainly
a
well
crafted
beer
and
one
which
i
highly
recommend

settles
in

a

color
the
head
is
bunyanesque
in

the
texture
semicreamy

it
slowly
erodes
and
the
lace
forms
a
thick
and
sticky
blanket
to

off

the

finish
is
light

carbonation
with
a
spicy

and
the

with
a
nice

the
smell
is
grassy
and
malty
very
effervesant
taste
is
similar
and
extremely
smooth
malty
and
sweet
in
the
beginning
then
crisp
and
hoppy
in
the
end
very
well
balanced
a
unique
style
that
i
am
growing
to
love
if
france
has
more
beers
like
this
we
could
mend
fences
even
faster
it
pours
a
clear
reddish
amber
and
has
a
good
sized
head
the
aroma
is
spicy
and
fruity
with
some
floral
notes
it
has
a
good
malt
backbone
and
a
lot
of
flavors
it
is
earthy
with
some
orange
and
anise
notes
it
finishes
somewhat
dry
and
with
a
nice
bitterness

find
kristal
clear
amber
color
with
a
soft
white
thick
pillow
of
foam
that
leaves
scattered
splotches
and
retains
well
aromas
are
peppery
assertively
hoppy
mildly
honeyed
and
are
balanced
by
rich
toasty
malted
notes
the
mouthfeel
is
full
crisp
very
smooth
and
just
buzzes
with
hop
bitter
this
is
rather
like
the
saison
dupont
in
style
though
it
has
more
of
a
piney
hop
character
and
perhaps
a
deeper
malt
component
the
balance
here
is
astounding
the
long
hoppy
finish
lingers
and
is
enveloped
by
just
the
right
amount
of
malt
sweetness
this
is
a
hard
to
put
down
really
well
made
beer
thanks
again
to
ron
at
shelton
bros
for
another
stellar
sample
are
these
bros
not
putting
together
one
of
the
most
exciting
portfolios
on
the
market
or
what
this
pours
a
slightly
hazy
pale
amber
color
with
a
long
lasting
frothy
head
it
has
lots
of
carbonation
but
uncharacteristically
add
to
the
drinking
experience
rather
than
distracting
from
it
it
has
a
slightly
thick
feel
on
the
tongue
with
a
subtle
sweetness
the
aroma
has
a
touch
of
apple
in
it
in
my
opinion
this
beer
has
a
lot
of
small
subtle
tastes
smells
that
add
up
to
a
very
nice
beer
a
beer
to
guard
youre
damn
right
back
away
from
my
bottle
or
else
of
5
bier
de
gardes
tasted
on
the
same
night
this
was
3rd
drinkable
but
not
very
exciting
swung
out
to
the
brewery
to
pick
up
some
bottles
of
this
years
vintage
and
grabbed
a
pint
brew
arrived
in
a
pint
nice
transparent
copper
color
with
a
thin
had
that
bubbled
away
quick
but
left
a
thin
skin
of
bubbles
on
the
surface
nice
rich
color
and
streaky
leaving
nose
is
fairly
muted
but
one
can
detect
nice
caramel
almost
buiscit
notes
taste
is
more
if
the
same
but
far
more
toasted
nice
crystallized
malt
really
nice
body
very
balanced
really
drinkable
and
enjoyable
bdg
makes
me
really
enjoy
a
style
that
i
otherwise
couldnt
care
much
for
o
on
par
if
not
better
than
last
years
vintage
another
high
quality
beer
from
evan
this
beer
is
a
well
hidden
christmas
treat
for
us
locals
cheers
overall
a
decent
brew
although
nothing
really
to
exceptional
for
the
price
it
had
a
good
level
of
complexity
but
in
some
ways
was
a
bit
too
complicated
and
confusing
as
some
of
the
flavors
really
did
not
transition
and
meld
together
well
one
to
try
but
not
really
one
i
would
go
to
back
to
again
and
again
overall
another
amazing
offering
from
philera
southampton
i
can
only
hope
they
can
continue
this
tradition
of
amazing
beers
appearance
is
a
deep
orange
and
copper
tone
with
an
offwhite
head
its
nose
has
spice
honey
and
some
caramel
the
taste
of
this
biere
de
garde
contains
some
bread
light
malts
hay
and
a
small
amount
of
fruit
it
is
all
subdue
too
much
perhaps
mouthfeel
is
low
dry
finish
one
of
the
better
choices
from
this
style
imho
pours
a
lightly
hazed
amber
decent
head
and
retention
scent
brings
musty
wet
hay
and
spicy
yeast
before
notes
of
toffee
and
roasted
nuts
present
themselves
taste
follows
scent
with
an
initial
push
of
musty
hay
dried
grain
moderately
spicy
and
lightly
bready
yeasts
nice
dry
toasted
nut
and
toffee
flavors
throughout
rustic
comes
to
mind
medium
bodied
lightly
grainy
on
the
palate
yet
smooth
overall
a
very
nice
seasonal
offering
that
doesnt
make
it
all
about
the
spices
d
awesome
because
of
the
lower
abv
and
lack
of
heavy
malts
and
spiciness
this
one
can
be
had
all
night
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
fizzy
and
chewy
in
the
finish
i
really
wanted
to
like
this
one
but
like
a
lot
of
southampton
brews
this
just
isnt
doing
it
for
me
french
country
christmas
ale
seems
like
this
should
work
but
ultimately
does
not
simply
a
fair
biere
de
garde
and
thats
a
pity
i
dont
think
this
bière
de
garde
although
it
was
good
will
have
the
same
kind
of
effect
which
is
just
as
well
because
nothing
could
possibly
make
me
love
christmas
more
than
i
already
do
southampton
is
a
great
brewery
but
the
best
of
their
offerings
come
in
the
750ml
corked
and
caged
bottles
given
the
option
grab
those
over
the
bombers
overall
i
would
say
that
southamptons
christmas
beer
is
pretty
good
and
the
drinkability
follows
suit
the
beer
pours
a
copper
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
sweet
crystal
malt
scent
along
with
a
slight
dry
mustiness
the
taste
is
good
as
well
it
has
a
dry
musty
flavor
that
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
with
some
caramel
sweetness
its
moderatly
bitter
with
little
in
the
way
of
yeast
esters
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
mediumfull
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
good
drinking
biere
de
garde
its
true
to
style
and
full
of
character
nice
work
this
is
a
good
winter
beer
with
good
drinkability
not
the
most
complex
or
robust
but
the
gentleness
of
the
phenols
and
the
lack
of
overly
cloying
sweetness
typical
of
many
bieres
de
garde
help
with
this
beers
drinkability
for
sure
poured

this
one
was
discounted
for
being
a
leftover
of
the
xmas
season
ill
a
20
discount
on
this
any
day
excellent
beer
ontap
at
the
farmhouse
in
emmaus
this
isnt
far
removed
from
a
belgian
pale
ale
or
amber
but
theres
a
little
something
extra
in
the
flavor
its
a
literally
flowery
like
rose
petals
beyond
that
the
beer
has
an
array
of
subtle
flavors
that
range
from
dry
biscuity
malts
to
light
citrus
rind
hops
and
fruity
caramel
this
beer
is
not
the
richest
but
the
mellow
complexities
are
quite
nice
certainly
worth
a
try
rich
and
malty
billowing
to
encompass
the
taste
buds
a
lot
of
people
taste
this
as
dry
it
doesnt
seem
overly
dry
to
me
but
it
does
seem
nice
and
crisp
not
too
overly
sweet
even
though
there
is
a
strong
malt
component
with
not
a
lot
of
hops
on
the
other
end
of
the
spectrum
a
little
thin
in
the
middle
not
much
to
bridge
the
gap
after
the
initial
malt
tastes
some
of
strawberry
peach
mild
fruit
high
drinkability
as
expected
it
all
blends
together
fairly
well
i
had
no
expectations
going
in
to
this
but
now
that
ive
tried
it
im
impressed
it
isnt
amazing
but
what
i
presume
to
be
a
pretty
good
representation
of
a
dry
yet
sweet
ale
i
thought
the
abv
was
a
bit
higher
than
the
actual
6
60
of
this
beer
maybe
because
its
a
holiday
beer
and
i
expect
them
to
be
a
bit
stronger
and
celebratory
in
nature
no
matter
this
is
very
easy
to
enjoy
on
a
night
like
this
and
worth
a
try
once
for
someone
who
wants
to
celebrate
the
holidays
witout
overloading
on
spice
or
alcohol
a
great
beer
to
start
the
new
year
off
with
i
remember
taste
testing
this
against
the
harpoon
warmer
with
the
owners
brother
at
the
filling
station
i
liked
the
texture
of
this
one
as
opposed
to
the
spiciness
of
the
harpoon
this
one
has
a
thick
syrupy
coating
and
a
smooth
warm
fruity
finish
this
improves
as
it
warms
with
hints
of
apple
and
grapes
but
a
light
delicate
flavor
in
contrast
with
the
mouthfeel
a
touch
more
carbonation
would
probably
help
but
that
could
have
been
lost
in
the
growler
fill
or
the
four
days
it
took
me
to
open
it
very
good
not
great
but
worth
trying
handsome
maltybrown
color
with
a
bubbly
head
quite
malty
in
the
nose
with
definite
overtones
of
peach
and
strawberry
maybe
even
raspberry
the
taste
had
less
fruit
than
the
aroma
but
was
still
very
fruity
with
apples
and
plenty
of
malt
before
a
light
but
sharp
hops
whack
at
the
end
decent
body
with
light
carbonation
very
brisk
and
tangy
despite
the
abv
i
didnt
find
the
alcohol
to
be
particularly
present
a
decent
find
not
spectacular
but
quite
nice
especially
the
berries
in
the
aroma
d
quite
good
i
hope
theres
some
left
crystal
clear
copper
with
a
fizzy
beige
cap
that
settled
into
a
solid
collar
and
thin
skim
of
bubbles
a
bit
sticky
with
decent
head
retention
biscuit
malt
aroma
with
a
hint
of
caramel
stone
fruits
and
light
hop
aroma
very
mellow
low
bitterness
with
light
caramel
sweetness
and
some
grain
character
less
fruitiness
than
in
the
aroma
but
still
with
a
nice
peach
undertone
hops
and
a
bit
of
spice
appeared
in
the
finish
perhaps
a
hint
of
warmth
too
lingering
herbal
hop
notes
medium
bodied
yet
just
short
of
a
sticky
viscous
texture
ample
carbonation
gave
it
a
lightness
without
the
fizzy
rush
of
overcarbonation
very
well
balanced
quite
elegant
overall
very
drinkable
and
quite
tasty
overall
a
very
solid
little
beer
here
something
i
would
have
no
problem
at
all
enjoying
a
little
more
often
quite
nice
and
a
winner
at
the
party
tonight
a
little
bit
of
this
goes
a
long
way
but
have
to
say
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
it
reminds
me
a
bit
of
the
mad
elf
though
theres
not
as
much
cherry
flavor
this
is
a
great
beer
for
the
winter
very
good
stuff
the
guy
at
the
beer
store
told
me
this
beer
was
flying
off
the
shelf
i
decided
to
try
it
since
i
like
trying
local
brews
pours
a
nice
amber
in
to
a
tulip
glass
shwoing
off
its
clarity
as
well
not
much
in
aroma
mostly
bready
but
not
offensive
sweetness
dominates
at
first
but
becomes
more
structured
after
the
first
few
sips
hints
of
some
kind
of
herb
very
well
made
shows
its
a
substantial
brew
by
the
way
it
sits
on
your
tounge
with
a
nice
long
aftertaste
highly
recommended
and
a
bit
different
drinkability
the
version
i
am
drinking
is
a
contract
brewed
bomber
that
says
french
style
christmas
ale
on
the
label
perhaps
the
recipe
has
changed
over
time
but
i
view
this
more
in
the
winter
warmer
camp
than
a
biere
de
garde
despite
what
the
label
says
having
said
that
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
drinkability
is
extremely
good
with
a
great
taste
lighter
and
dry
it
goes
down
very
easily
still
its
got
enough
depth
that
pondering
is
rewarded
refreshing
and
satisfying
it
paired
well
with
the
leftover
turkey
perhaps
not
perfect
a
bit
to
brawny
but
very
tasty
i
also
tried
it
in
direct
comparison
to
an
at
least
1
5
year
old
bottle
of
sans
culotte
it
was
so
vastly
superior
i
couldnt
have
another
sip
until
i
had
savored
the
last
drop
of
this
i
will
try
as
much
of
this
as
i
can
overall
this
was
an
interesting
beer
that
i
may
just
need
to
get
familiarized
with
the
style
thoroughly
enjoyable
brew
and
i
will
definitely
seek
this
out
again
out
of
the
22oz
bomber
pours
an
exceptional
clear
and
pretty
copper
color
nice
fluffy
egg
shell
colored
head
that
settled
fairly
quick
into
a
light
ring
the
aroma
is
fairly
light
a
sweet
toasted
malt
with
a
touch
a
hoppy
spice
the
taste
is
of
a
toasted
malt
with
a
sprucey
hop
bite
lemon
rind
and
a
tart
cranberry
like
fruitiness
the
brew
sits
well
on
the
palate
slightly
chewy
prickly
carbonation
finishes
with
a
spicy
sweetness
a
nice
and
spicy
biere
de
garde
more
of
a
hoppy
spice
than
yeasty
spice
mdexpert
stuff
here
lively
bubbles
lighten
the
load
of
the
barley
and
the
alcohol
is
wellmasked
perfect
beer
for
a
fire
notes
i
got
a
good
beer
for
my
money
no
complaints
here
as
it
was
easy
to
drink
and
a
pleasure
to
have
i
felt
that
style
wise
they
got
a
little
creativebut
it
was
done
well
and
i
enjoyed
it
they
did
not
nail
the
style
likely
intentionally
a
fine
belgian
near
sticky
yeasty
ale
with
good
malting
and
a
significant
but
not
bold
spiciness
fairly
easy
to
drink
after
a
warm
finally
day
and
went
well
with
the
food
lightly
orangey
with
lots
of
foamed
bubbles
in
a
word
sweetish
belgian
yeast
my
bottle
is
in
a
750

bottle
it
has

it

just

this
is
an
awesome
brew
im
starting
to
really
like
this
style
highly
recommended
i
seem
to
almost
be
disapointed
with
southhampton
beers
on
tap
ive
never
been
to
the
brewery
but
im
almost
always
happy
with
their
bottled
product
this
just
may
be
the
prettiest
beer
ive
laid
eyes
on
and
the
better
news
is
that
laying
my
mouth
on
it
was
quite
a
pleasure
as
well
it
has
mellow
twists
and
turns
an
intriguing
yet
innocent
complexity
and
a
cozily
manageable
abv
that
makes
drinking
it
damn
near
an
elysian
dream
words
cant
thank
the
man
adequately
so
ill
let
my
actions
speak
volumes
and
try
to
get
my
tongue
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass

mouthfeel
was
great
medium
to
high
levels
of
carbonation
i
could
feel
the
brew
on
my
tongue
for
quite
a
while
after
swallowing
a
sensation
i
rather
enjoyed
drinkability
was
very
low
i
enjoyed
the
brew
a
bit
at
the
beginning
but
the
beer
was
just
way
too
harsh
on
the
palate
stinging
bottom
line
heres
a
brew
thats
so
different
from
anything
ive
tasted
before
its
scary
but
dont
be
afraid
to
try
it
the
adventure
is
worth
it
2005
750ml
bottle
damn
that
was
one
of
the
loudest
pops
of
a
champagne
cork
i
have
ever
heard
needless
to
say
it
left
a
mighty
noisy
and
active
head
it
took
a
while
to
settle
down
surprise
to
see
it
so
clear
nice
amber
color
pleasant
nose
of
caramel
and
sour
cherriescranberries
subtle
but
obvious
spices

white
pepper
nutmeg
maybe
ginger
all
of
this
is
very
light
but
not
impossible
to
taste
better
as
it
warms
a
good
interpretation
of
the
style
i
hope
i
have
this
beer
review
entered
properly
if
so
it
seems
to
me
that
the
listed
entry
is
very
confusing
i
almost
missed
it
and
assbackwards
being
as
the
biere
de
garde
is
the
prominent
text
and
the
smaller
text
french
farmhouse
style
ale
is
in
much
smaller
text
below
that
and
i
cannot
find
any
mention
of
the
word
christmas
ale
anywhere
someone
needs
to
alter
the
way
this
beer
is
listed
to
avoid
duplicate
entries
i
feel
on
tap
at
half
time
in
poughkeepsie
ny
we
brought
home
a
growler
for
what
else
christmas
however
we
couldnt
wait
so
we
gave
ourselves
an
early
gift
the
french
country
christmas
ale
poured
a
rich
and
deep
reddish
amber
with
a
thin
khaki
head
grassy
but
in
a
fresh
sweet
way
and
hoppy
to
the
nose
there
is
also
a
hint
of
maple
syrup
underneath
frankly
i
found
the
taste
a
touch
thin
and
statica
disappointment
really
given
what
i
found
to
be
the
complexity
of
the
aroma
the
malts
dominated
figs
prunes
the
taste
settled
smoothly
but
it
never
evolved
and
the
carbonation
seemed
too
demanding
overall
fantastic
ive
had
a
lot
of
good
beers
lately
but
this
one
is
truly
superlative
the
flavor
has
so
much
in
it
and
im
still
tasting
little
delicious
apricot
notes
twenty
minutes
after
finishing
quite
a
beer
i
had
this
with
thanksgiving
dinner
while
a
good
match
more
herbal
characteristics
which
may
have
been
there
but
i
thought
i
was
imagining
them
would
have
made
it
a
better
thanksgiving
match
mouthfeel
is
smooth
spritzy
light
and
easy
to
drink
a
tasty
treat
that
i
could
no
doubt
drink
all
day
easily
the
best
biere
de
garde
i
have
ever
tasted
definetly
a
brew
worth
seeking
out
and
another
fine
accomplishment
from
southampton
im
very
glad
i
still
have
another
bottle
of
this
one
for
future
enjoyment
autumnal
in
color
with
an
expansive
creamy
offwhite
head
the
aroma
contains
more
of
a
roasted
caramel
malt
character
than
i
would
have
expected
from
other
samplings
of
the
style
it
is
offset
however
by
a
slightly
musky
strawlike
scent
and
a
hint
of
grapey
sharpness
caramel
malt
is
strong
in
the
flavor
as
well
and
blends
nicely
into
a
subtle
woody
flavor
at
the
finish
a
bit
sweet
at
the
start
this
beer
develops
a
lot
of
complexity
throughout
the
sip
including
a
mostly
grapey
fruitiness
and
a
slightly
alcoholspiced
finish
full
in
the
mouth
yet
not
at
all
overwhelming
this
is
a
delightfully
drinkable
beer
notes
this
beer
is
nothing
like
southamptons
other
biere
de
garde
biere
de
mars
the
mars
is
lighter
both
appearance
and
tastewise
and
has
much
more
fruit
and
hop
flavor
many
thanks
to
mjr
for
the
kind
present
2004
edition
from
750
ml
pours
with
a
radiant
orange
hue
and
clean
white

subtle
and
small
carbonated
bubbles

us
of
handcrafted
qualities
sour

followed
by
clean
dry
earthy
finish
superb
white

fully
laced
thrones
above
the
sandy
murky

peaceful
and
balanced
aroma
in
which
no
flavour
takes
the
top
on

the
bready
yeast
gently
integrates
peppery
edges
among
the
generous
biscuity
malt
applesauce
grapes
and
pear
reminiscent
fruit
notes
unveil
a
vinous
earthiness
that
evolves
into
serious
cork
notes
not
in
an
unpleasant
way
in
the
nose
but
perhaps
a
bit
brash
in
mouth
quite
tart
and
clovey
the
taste
is
pretty
much
in
line
with
the
aroma
theres
just
more
sourness
than
youd
expect
not
as
impressive
as
most
southampton
but
still
one
of
the
good
bière
de
garde
ive
had
so
few
have
been
as
impressive
as
my
enthusiasm
for
discovering
more
from
this
elegant
style
appears
a
fairly
clear
bubbly
amber
with
a
tall
tan
head
the
head
stays
at
about
a
half
inch
cap
fluffy
cap
the
whole
time
while
leaving
rings
of
lace
aroma
is
a
bit
musty
and
funky
with
a
good
amount
of
fruitiness
and
spices
there
is
a
bit
of
sweetness
as
well
and
yeast
as
well
taste
is
pretty
strong
with
spice
and
the
musty
funk
a
bit
doughy
and
there
is
a
slight
tartness
towards
the
end
quite
a
variety
of
flavors
in
the
mix
here
there
is
also
a
slight
spicy
hop
bitterness
and
this
finishes
with
a
lingering
spice
and
funk
mouthfeel
was
crisp
and
bubbly
with
loads
of
carbonation
this
keep
me
coming
back
for
more
to
try
and
figure
out
all
the
flavors
overall
an
interesting
complex
and
tasty
brew
i
would
definitely
have
again
good
stuff
thanks
for
the
bottle
steve
overall
its
a
bit
darker
and
more
caramelaccented
than
most
of
the
larger
commercially
available
brands
but
its
certainly
far
from
authentic
this
is
exactly
the
type
of
beer
that
you
might
find
from
a
smaller
housebrewery
along
the
northern
border
very
well
done
enjoy
it
with
venison
or
a
darker
meat
alongside
lightly
buttered
vegetables
on
a
cool
night
or
as
a
relaxing
goblet
as
the
sun
goes
down
on
a
warm
summers
night
dark
peach
colored
with
a
pale
beige
tinted
head
this
dissapates
to
a
fine
persistant
sheen
herbal
fruity
nose
inital
taste
of
tropical
fruit
touched
by
metalic
sweet
malts
and
grapefruits
the
finish
also
has
hints
of
nutmeg
sour
plums
and
cinnamon
quite
complex
but
quite
medium
bodied
a
nice
regal
selection
this
is
a
great
beer
but
after
spending
about
a
month
in
france
over
the
summer
and
becoming
very
familiar
with
the
biere
de
garde
style
i
think
they
definately
missed
the
style
on
this
one
there
just
isnt
enough
toasted
malt
flavor
and
there
is
a
little
too
much
tartness
still
very
good
though
whatever
style
it
is
smooth
and
crisp
at
the
start
with
a
smooth
mildly
tart
finish
nicely
drinkable
and
quite
enjoyable
while
sipped
over
a
period
of
time
the
taste
is
much
different
than
the
nose
or
at
least
i
was
lead
to
believe
the
beer
would
taste
quite
a
bit
different
than
it
does
the
taste
is
quite
malty
with
a
finish
that
reminds
me
of
biscuits
and
lightly
toasted
wholegrain
bread
there
is
almost
a
chalky
quality
to
the
palate
of
this
one
it
seems
to
boost
the
body
and
make
this
beer
seem
a
bit
fuller
this
is
certainly
interesting
i
was
expecting
much
more
yeast
character
more
fruitiness
and
more
spiciness
this
is
one
of
those
biere
de
gardes
that
goes
for
the
cleaner
flavor
profile
and
relies
more
upon
the
malt
character
the
malts
in
this
beer
really
shine
without
the
amped
up
malts
this
would
be
a
flabby
beer
because
of
the
restrained
yeast
character
as
this
beer
warms
up
i
get
some
nice
fruitiness
up
front
with
notes
of
pear
and
apple
it
pours
a
beautiful
copperamber
that
is
mostly
clear
and
has
a
nice
head
and
some
decent
lacing
the
aroma
is
mostly
earthy
hops
but
there
is
a
faint
woodiness
to
it
as
well
as
some
detectable
malt
it
has
a
good
malt
backbone
and
is
slightly
tart
with
some
cedarwood
notes
and
a
dry
bitter
finish
this
is
fantastic
i
wish
i
bought
more
bottles
of
this
beer
overall
a
wellcrafted
and
delicious
example
of
a
rare
style
that
rarely
finds
its
students
sticking
to
the
guidelines
too
damn
good
this
is
absolutely
what
the
trois
monts
grand
reserve
should
be
all
in
all
a
tasty
brew
that
im
very
happy
to
have
tried
an
excellent
version
highly
recommended
flavor
is
much
less
sour
than
expected
with
a
pervasive
belgian
candi
sweetness
coupled
with
hints
of
pineapple
apricot
and
raisin
the
beer
starts
out
mildly
sour
tapering
down
to
a
saccharine
sweetness
and
finishing
fairly
dry
impressive
in
the
way
it
changes
flavors
so
seamlessly
light
alcoholic
warmth
in
the
throat
and
almost
no
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
terrific
with
small
tightly
knit
bubbles
very
authentic
better
than
the
imported
versions
ive
tried
thus
far
the
hops
are
wierd
they
taste
almost
like
hallertau
but
not
quite
herbal
but
strange
must
be
a
breed
im
not
familiar
with
very
good
beer
a
pleasure
to
drink
i
must
say
thanks
to
herbjones
for
sharing
this
with
me
this
pours
a
cloudy
orange
with
a
big
white
head
the
flavors
the
aroma
are
like
wet
grass
barnyards
etc
for
me
these
characteristics
arent
too
appealing
i
just
didnt
like
this
beer
oh
well
cloudy
murky
beer
light
brown
in
color
the
aroma
is
weak
theres
almost
nothing
there
if
you
whiff
real
hard
you
can
catch
some
hints
of
fruit
but
its
a
chore
tastes
primarily
of
cherry
smooth
good
mouthfeel
as
the
beer
drains
it
creates
a
sour
taste
in
the
mouth
kind
of
like
drinking
milk
a
front
porch
baguette
and
cheese
eatin
brew
pours
a
clouded
streaming
amber
under
whipped
butter
monumental
nose
of
honeysuckle
in
full
bloom
beach
walks
at
dusk
and
fruitflavored
marshmallows
a
draught
is
honeyroasted
peach
on
barn
board
with
a
side
of
soil
covered
garden
greens
and
fallow
field
stones
i
mean
earthy
like
when
you
were
a
kid
and
played
in
the
lake
and
dug
in
the
dirt
and
ate
roasted
corn
and
tasted
the
day
on
your
lips
playful
across
the
buds
a
fine
brew
thanks
loren
a
decent
brew
but
seems
to
lack
obvious
large
yeast
and
noticeable
properties
that
seem
to
make
the
style
so
distinct
a
very
subtle
garde
but
also
real
easy
drinking
because
of
that
excellent
beer
very
smooth
taste
aroma
doesnt
justify
the
taste
must
try
on
tap
not
bottle
overall
this
is
an
interesting
beer
it
starts
out
a
bit
underwhelming
but
builds
into
something
rather
nice
i
feel
like
i
once
tried
this
beer
back
in
my
nova
days
but
i
cant
be
sure
oh
well
gonna
haveta
have
it
potentially
again
problems
such
as
these
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
mostly
clear
golden
amber
topped
by
a
finger
of
lightly
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
sweet
biscuit
light
toffee
orange
zest
a
twinge
of
lemon
peel
and
a
slight
hint
of
what
may
or
may
not
be
apricot
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
some
spices
tossed
in
for
the
sake
of
it
particularly
black
pepper
and
mild
clove
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
drying
finish
overall
a
pretty
nice
beer
one
i
could
see
drinking
again
though
its
unlikely
to
find
its
way
to
the
top
of
my
prospective
list
nothing
particularly
pops
but
still
a
simple
malt
and
yeast
character
that
works
if
not
particularly
exceptional
still
very
enjoyable
overall
i
liked
this
and
consider
it
an
above
average
beer
first
bier
de
mars
so
i
am
far
from
being
able
to
rate
this
against
others
in
this
type
i
also
think
this
is
a
style
that
should
be
drunk
very
fresh
and
closer
to
season
which
i
unfortunately
did
not
do
that
being
said
i
would
look
for
this
again
and
would
look
for
the
brewer
again
as
well
overall
pleasant
enough
but
there
is
nothing
memorable
here
o
ok
but
nothing
special
poured

satisfying
mouth
feel
nicely
done
feel
excellent
creamy
but
lively
feel
with
medium
body
overall
my
first
time
with
this
style
not
a
huge
departure
from
a
traditional
amber
ale
im
glad
to
have
tried
this
pours
a
golden
copper
with
a
finger
of
head
the
nose
is
yeasty
and
there
is
also
some
sweet
note
as
well
syrup
or
perhaps
molasses
the
malt
is
quite
forward
considering
the
body
is
fairly
light
there
is
the
classic
belgian
funky
tartness
but
it
is
relatively
mild
the
finish
is
semidry
this
beer
is
lovely
malt
forward
in
a
way
that
is
playful
and
with
a
fruit
character
that
is
as
lovely
as
the
thought
of
the
fruit
itself
i
like
this
style
very
much
and
its
my
first
time
with
it
i
would
call
it
subtle
and
a
bit
savory
with
an
elegant
taste
of
fruit
admit
to
not
being
that
fond
of
southampton
beers
but
this
one
is
quite
pleasant
certaily
wouldnt
pass
it
up
again
rjt
o
overall
it
feels
like
an
octoberfest
sweetly
malted
with
a
bit
of
musky
yeasty
saison
quality
nobel
hop
presence
and
a
solid
good
making
per
style
good
drinkability
o
i
really
expected
more
out
of
this
one
could
definitely
say
its
refreshing
but
thats
about
it
scent
and
taste
are
weak
and
i
would
have
liked
a
bit
of
a
drier
crisper
finish
definitely
needs
more
to
it
if
its
going
to
be
6
5
the
rest
to
be
fair
this
is
a
style
i
dont
have
a
lot
of
expirence
with
it
reminds
me
somewhat
of
a
dubble
but
the
malt
and
sweetness
is
just
a
bit
too
unbalanced

would
have
liked
a

pilsner

to
come
through

b
overall
really
a
restrained
beer
that
shows
its
strengths
when
you
pay
a
little
more
attention
to
it
definitely
not
a
beer
that
makes
a
real
strong
first
impression
but
has
some
saison
like
qualities
and
also
some
kolsch
traits
not
unpleasant
but
the
flavor
profile
was
fairly
subdued
and
one
dimensional
overall
i
enjoyed
this
brew
quite
a
bit
i
enjoyed
some
of
the
unique
aspects
of
it
and
the
only
negative
thing
i
could
say
was
just
about
the
flatness
of
it
stopped
by
the
publick
house
for
a
bite
and
to
pick
up
some
irs
bottles
ordered
a
flight
with
bratwurst

a
few
ounce
sample

transparent
yellow

fairly

has
nice

with

really
nice
very
light
and
easy
drinking
as
i
sipped
the
fruit
came
out
on
the
nose
pleasant
beer
bottle
poured
a
hazy
beige
color
ale
with
a
rather
large
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
lacing
aroma
consists
of
rustic
malt
with
lightly
sweet
undertones
taste
is
dominated
by
sweet
notes
upfront
with
some
rustic
malt
and
light
fruity
ester
this
is
probably
a
tad
too
sweet
for
my
liking
body
is
quite
full
with
good
carbonation
and
no
apparent
alcohol
good
though
probably
tad
more
sweet
then
some
of
its
overseas
cousin
d
a
pretty
fruity
brew
and
unfortunately
in
my
opinion
a
bit
one
note
fruit
is
the
main
everything
here
and
while
pleasant
i
wouldnt
hate
for
some
more
diversity
in
both
flavor
and
aroma
there
are
better
bdg
out
there
and
better
brews
from
southampton
its
not
my
favorite
style
the
beer
is
only
just
slightly
better
than
average
its
not
difficult
to
drink
its
just
lacking
some
character
overall
not
what
i
expected
when
i
ordered
it
not
interesting
enough
to
overcome
its
flaws
o
american
brewers
latched
on
to
the
saison
style
fairly
quickly
and
are
now
pushing
the
boundaries
of
the
style
with
black
saisons
and
the
like
im
surprised
that
the
biere
de
marsbiere
de
garde
styles
remain
relatively
unexplored
it
seems
to
me
that
there
would
be
a
market
for
it
with
all
the
saison
experimentation
thats
going
on
i
found
this
to
be
a
very
enjoyable
beer
just
found
this
at
a
small
grocery
in
central
new
york
was
in
a
6er
and
the
bottles
were
dusty
i
knew
it
couldnt
be
the
freshest
as
this
is
traditionally
a
springtime
release
but
i
picked
it
up
because
id
never
had
anything
from
southampton
and
didnt
feel
like
a
becks
which
was
my
next
best
choice
unfortunately
was
happily
delighted
by
this
beer
which
pours
a
toasted
orange
color
more
clear
than
i
am
used
to
in
the
style
with
effervescent
carbonation
and
a
short
off
white
head
the
nose
is
fruity
like
orange
rind
with
some
mild
sweetness
and
belgian
style
yeast
spice
tones
flavor
matches
up
with
a
really
bright
feel
attatched
to
the
fruit
and
spice
there
is
nothing
heavy
about
this
brew
at
all
crackery
crisp
in
the
finish
with
the
zesty
orange
lasting
all
the
way
through
the
flavor
matrix
this
is
a
beautiful
beer
balanced
and
clean
i
could
only
imagine
how
nice
it
might
be
fresh
light
body
down
easy
if
i
wasnt
sharing
the
6er
i
would
have
put
it
down
alone
easily
this
makes
me
want
to
drink
more
beers
from
this
place
nice
brew
overall
pretty
solid
but
a
bit
unusual
i
would
absolutely
reach
for
this
one
again
if
i
were
in
the
northeast
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
color
was
a
dark
amber
with
a
1
finger
dirty
white
creamy
head
head
only
lasted
a
few
minutes
despite
a
fair
amount
of
carbonation
rising
from
the
sides
aroma
was
roasted
grains
with
a
small
bit
of
fruit
sweetness
that
almost
hid
a
bit
of
alcohol
smell
flavor
as
a
malty
sweet
small
hint
of
peppery
spice
alcohol
was
detectable
and
came
on
pretty
fast
felt
good
in
the
mouth
coated
well
and
had
a
tad
of
carbonation
overall
not
bad
well
balanced
and
sippable
but
not
outstanding
overall
a
pleasant
beer
from
a
good
brewery
wouldnt
mind
giving
this
a
go
on
draft
this
one
didnt
work
as
much
for
me
o
interesting
spice
notes
coming
thru
with
just
a
hint
of
maltyness
fighting
its
way
onto
the
palette
before
the
hops
bitterness
rushes
it
away
pretty
drinkable
but
i
like
a
biere
de
garde
to
be
a
little
less
spiced
from
the
12
oz
bottle
oddly
enough
available
at
the
supermarket
in
dc
pours
copper
colored
and
hazy
with
little
to
no
head
and
some
lacing
the
aroma
is
apple
cidar
with
savory
notes
and
fruity
undertones
the
taste
is
right
in
line
with
the
aroma
and
the
mouthfeel
is
rich
but
not
sweet
i
am
drinking
this
beer
at
the
end
of
may
and
i
think
it
would
be
better
enjoyed
in
its
intended
month
of
march
with
the
cold
weather
still
in
the
air
good
beer
but
bad
timing
much
improved
from
the
bottle
version
with
a
lower
carbonation
smoother
mouthfeel
fuller
body
still
a
little
one
dimensional
quite
malty
with
caramel
and
honey
sweetness
and
very
restrained
floral
hops
hints
of
black
pepper
and
other
spices
cloves
and
coriander
mostly
not
yeasty
enough
for
my
tastes
mostly
just
doughy
bready
malt
flavor
lightly
hazed
orange
color
with
a
small
white
head
decent
retention
and
lacing
a
bit
unexciting
overall
overall
good
balance
of
flavors
good
spices
pretty
sweet
but
has
a
bit
of
hops
to
help
balance
it
draught
cambridge
house
this
one
pours
a
crystal
clear
slightly
darker
amber
color
there
was
just
a
wisp
of
an
off
white
head
that
still
left
some
lacing
there
is
a
pleasant
nose
to
it
mainly
malts
and
some
fruits
hints
of
belgian
yeast
also
the
taste
is
also
very
good
just
a
touch
belgian
style
sweet
caramel
malts
some
fruits
and
earthy
hops
very
smooth
and
easy
drinking
a
nice
beer
o
i
wouldnt
call
this
bland
but
i
was
hoping
for
so
much
more
from
this
fantastic
brewery
not
bad
but
im
not
sure
ill
be
buying
this
again
anytime
soon
id
gladly
give
this
one
a
shot
again
if
i
knew
how
fresh
it
was
until
then
ill
have
to
pass
this
has
the
sourness
that
one
expects
from
a
farmhouse
styled
beer
mostly
malty
but
there
is
a
touch
of
light
spice
from
the
hop
smooth
body
with
a
long
peppery
aftertaste
lowly
carbonated
mouthfeel
is
good
medium
body
with
light
to
moderate
carbonation
this
is
a
strange
brew
seems
to
me
to
be
a
mix
of
styles
ive
only
had
three
biere
de
gardes
oro
de
calabaza
jacks
abbys
and
this
and
theyve
all
tasted
quite
different
hard
to
say
whats
going
on
o
good
beer
but
expected
more
fruit
dominant
flavors
not
very
complex
and
would
like
a
little
more
to
this
beer
d
a
good
beer
might
not
get
it
again
but
its
one
of
the
only
bierre
de
gardes
ive
seen
an
american
brewery
put
in
a
12
oz
bottle
so
publick
deserves
credit
for
that
at
least
worth
trying
its
not
often
you
get
a
bierre
de
garde
from
a
120z
bottle
o
it
is
enjoyable
enough
i
could
drink
a
couple
but
i
must
be
honest
im
not
particularly
fond
of
the
style
that
is
if
this
is
a
good
representation
of
the
style
o
great
beer
i
will
def
pick
up
some
more
so
good
for
the
price
overall
this
beer
is
taste
but
not
my
favorite
of
the
style
i
dont
think
this
was
a
bad
or
old
bottle
i
just
believe
it
wasnt
done
well
if
i
am
wrong
somebody
please
approach
me
and
i
will
happily
trade
for
a
different
bottle
cheers
toby
o
incredibly
refreshing
and
easy
drinking
great
for
warmer
weather
overall
its
a
very
good
choice
to
kick
back
with
wow
balanced
and
really
sessionable
very
good
stuff
that
is
a
party
pleaser
for
sure
spot
on
stuff
here
really
digging
this
one
had
more
hopes
for
southampton
on
this
one
cant
win
em
all
overallnot
impressed
and
a
little
disappointed
on
this
one
i
usually
love
southampton
too
very
good
worth
grabbing
i
will
make
this
quick
but
bottom
line
is
i
really
like
this
cheap
beer
i
found
a
great
deal
at
under
8
for
a
sixer
it
is
pretty
looking
with
a
great
reddish
hue
sweet
and
malty
smelling
and
very
refreshing
and
fruity
notes
of
grapfruit
and
mango
i
will
be
having
many
more
of
these
i
am
gaining
more
and
more
respect
for
southampton
gonna
try
their
grand
cru
and
abt
12
soon
mark
my
words
pours
a
clear
amberish
gold
with
a
medium
sized
head
smell
is
weak
malty
with
some
fruit
big
malty
flavor
toffee
just
a
little
toasty
hoppy
bitterness
throughout
just
a
little
sweetness
underneath
rounds
things
out
phenolic
and
earthy
in
the
finish
well
carbonated
and
medium
bodied
pretty
drinkable
and
overall
a
good
beer
o
this
beer
does
have
a
couple
of
decent
qualities
but
it
fails
in
the
flavor
category
a
nice
copper
bronze
hue
on
the
pour
with
a
small
short
lived
white
head
aroma
of
sweet
malt
some
light
floral
citrus
hops
and
nice
spicy
fruity
notes
taste
is
sweet
malt
some
nice
spicy
fruitiness
some
light
hops
and
maybe
some
light
vanilla
flavoring
palate
is
nice
smooth
slightly
creamy
texture
medium
body
with
moderate
carbonation
finish
is
sweet
caramel
malt
some
light
hops
ending
in
slightly
spicy
fruitiness
with
some
light
vanilla
flavoring
overall
a
very
nicely
balance
and
flavorful
brew
o
i
thought
this
would
be
a
style
that
southampton
would
nail
but
this
beer
has
an
odd
very
unpleasant
aroma
and
flavor
would
like
to
try
it
on
tap
or
even
better
the
750ml
version
some
day
for
comparison
o
easy
drinking
glad
i
was
able
to
try
this
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
copper
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
grains
malts
taste
is
also
of
malts
and
grains
some
hops
at
the
finish
not
bad
but
nothing
special
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
pretty
good
beer
omeh
overall
nice
beer
and
great
style
ive
had
this
from
the
more
recent
12oz
bottles
as
well
and
a
bunch
of
times
on
tap
it
never
compared
to
that
first
750ml
publick
house
bottle
which
was
just
lovely
in
its
fine
nuance
and
subtlety
overall
another
shining
example
of
why
the
publick
house
of
sh
is
long
islands
beer
scene
another
terrific
offering
the
beer
pours
a
beautiful
amber
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
delicate
mix
of
caramel
malt
sweetness
victory
malt
nuttiness
and
a
wonderful
yeast
fruitiness
the
taste
is
good
as
well
it
has
a
smooth
caramel
flavor
with
a
subtle
yeast
fruitiness
its
mellow
with
a
faint
nuttiness
and
silky
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
really
good
beer
true
to
style
and
quite
delicious
o
i
quite
liked
it
no
overthetop
flavors
just
a
solid
good
tasting
beer
poured
into
a
pint
glass
a
clear
golden
orange
with
no
head
to
speak
of
by
the
time
it
reached
me
thin
aroma
bready
with
hints
of
peach
taste
was
fruity
up
front
peach
and
banana
yeasty
in
the
background
followed
by
a
distinct
sour
citrus
zest
and
a
lingering
bitterness
medium
body
and
smooth
fairly
drinkable
d
very
drinkable
the
flavors
are
all
really
nicely
balanced
the
toasted
caramel
malt
flavor
in
particular
is
really
nice
that
it
avoids
tasting
coppery
ill
say
what
probably
many
who
try
this
beer
may
think
and
say
that
its
a
very
interesting
beer
it
pours
golden
with
a
brownorange
hue
with
a
thinner
head
the
smell
upfront
is
a
strong
spice
which
i
cant
quite
place
but
id
describe
it
as
savory
this
is
a
beer
that
may
need
some
meat
to
back
it
up
definitely
needs
to
be
paired
with
a
meal
the
spice
fades
a
bit
as
i
drink
on
revealing
a
sweeter
honey
like
flavor
beneath
lacking
in
hops
i
wanted
something
with
an
older
mustier
taste
to
it
the
beer
is
a
little
sticky
but
not
bad
by
any
right
many
likable
elements
but
just
misses
on
a
few
areas
a
little
mushy
a
little
soft
not
a
great
intro
to
the
style
but
not
horrible
either
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
that
i
will
try
again
soon

overall
quite
a
good
offering
from
southampton
nice
flavor
and
im
thinking
that
given
my
lack
of
experience
with
this
style
that
its
probably
more
or
less
to
style
considering
that
brewmaster
phil
markowski
wrote
the
book
on
farmhouse
ales
literally
i
would
give
this
one
a
try
cheers
its
not
a
beer
that
id
drink
a
whole
lot
of
once
even
though
the
6
5
abv
makes
it
possible
for
those
who
are
used
to
the
big
beers
the
beer
is
quite
flavorful
and
it
really
fatigues
the
taste
buds
after
a
couple
but
the
taste
complexities
are
worth
the
effort
d
a
very
nice
unique
spring
seasonal
offering
from
the
fine
folks
at
southampton
nothing
remarkable
and
nothing
off
putting
simple
straight
forward
and
most
importantly
rather
tasty
overall
a
nice
spring
beer
that
is
more
of
a
slow
drinking
beer
but
nicely
flavorful
and
satisfying
taste
is
interesting
when
diagnosed
its
subtly
fruity
just
like
the
smell
but
not
cloyingly
a
sweet
honey
taste
wins
out
over
that
taste
however
and
is
followed
by
a
hoppy
and
sort
of
abrupt
finish
theres
a
bitterness
to
the
finish
the
beer
becomes
further
complex
with
an
alcohol
zest
that
lingers
after
the
swallow
its
a
really
interesting
beer
and
complex
but
fairly
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
one
criticism
however
is
a
slight
wateriness
to
the
mouthfeel
that
may
be
overlooked
if
your
not
looking
for
it
but
it
is
noticeable
otherwise
its
a
pretty
good
beer
and
one
that
will
have
your
taste
buds
working
hard
o
not
a
huge
fan
some
of
the
tastes
a
re
just
a
little
too
off
for
me
glad
to
have
tried
the
original
bottling
but
either
it
hasnt
held
up
well
or
it
was
just
off
to
begin
with
d
im
guessing
this
was
better
around
march
2008
at
this
stage
its
mostly
bland
and
inoffensive
not
something
id
seek
out
again
but
no
major
flaws
either
im
curious
how
it
compares
to
a
fresh
bottle
of
the
12oz
contract
brewed
version
o
meh
not
my
kinda
beer
not
really
digging
this
one
overall
a
tasty
beer
and
fairly
refreshing
making
it
an
ideal
springtime
brew
though
in
this
instance
i
had
it
ontap
it
is
nice
to
see
it
available
in
12
ounce
bottle
this
is
definitely
a
good
warm
weather
beer
very
refreshing
and
it
has
good
flavor
also
this
is
a
very
good
spring
beer
to
start
changing
your
pallet
over
from
the
great
darker
beers
of
winter
i
was
so
impressed
with
it
on
tap
that
i
had
to
bring
a
growler
home
if
you
are
in
southampton
i
highly
recommend
trying
it
enjoy
o
great
flavor
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
maybe
the
best
sh
ive
had
to
date
drinkability
and
overall
impression
this
is
a
nicely
drinkable
beer
that
i
could
see
having
again
one
day
ill
not
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
it
but
ill
certainly
not
pass
it
by
if
ive
another
chance
to
have
one
my
overall
impression
is
that
this
is
a
very
good
beer
that
has
several
virtues
and
few
weaknesses
overall
impressive
structure
very
nicely
put
together
its
big
but
not
to
big
and
the
spicing
is
full
but
not
overdone
well
balanced
flavorful
still
refreshing
quite
nice
12
oz
bottle
with
no
freshness
date
light
copper
color
half
inch
head
faded
very
quickly
to
just
beer
almost
no
lace
smells
sweet
and
musty
like
old
brewed
tea
sweet
malty
taste
hint
of
caramel
alcohol
oily
feel
to
it
after
taste
of
old
tea
poor
carbonation
overall
very
disappointed
i
have
had
southamptons
double
white
which
is
excellent
but
i
will
not
buy
this
beer
again
served
in
an
ommegang
goblet
nice
amberorange
color
with
a
thick
white
head
spicy
aroma
sweet
flavor
at
first
taste
with
a
nice
peppery
compliment
and
a
little
bit
of
bitterness
the
tail
end
drys
up
nicely
a
little
hint
of
alcohol
but
overall
very
refreshing
beer
nice
to
taste
a
good
american
made
version
of
this
style
overall
pretty
good
not
terribly
familiar
with
the
style
but
this
is
a
tasty
brew
i
wouldnt
mind
on
a
temperate
spring
day
the
taste
is
good
w
a
nice
blend
of
malt
tinges
and
yeast
flavor
which
gives
a
nice
apple
and
spice
flavor
w
light
appleskin
tannin
in
the
finish
overall
i
think
this
is
a
pretty
decent
beer
not
really
one
i
would
order
repeatedly
because
it
comes
off
as
slightly
sweet
after
the
first
few
sips
and
lacks
some
malt
of
a
more
traditional
example
imo
id
buy
this
again
without
question
d
the
alcohol
is
present
but
it
is
not
overpowering
it
is
complex
with
a
nice
musty
earth
mild
dry
fruit
sweetness
and
some
bitterness
from
the
hops
drinkability
alcohol
is
well
hidden
and
overall
a
tasty
brew
quite
easy
to
drink
a
6
pack
in
one
sitting
cheers
would
work
well
with
my
favorite
summertime
lunch
of
salads
grilled
meats
cheese
and
breads
value
made
by
pabst
great
appearance
is
very
nice
i
got
no
debris
in
the
glass
yet
no
head
due
to
the
being
being
a
spring
release
color
is
a
dirty
orange
smell
is
of
mild
grass
and
caramel
taste
is
on
the
sweet
side
with
quite
a
bit
of
bread
and
rye
maybe
some
citrus
sweet
bready
finish
makes
this
beer
a
treat
mouth
feel
is
pretty
nice
with
a
very
light
to
medium
body
for
the
drinkability
i
would
really
have
to
have
this
fresh
since
it
really
could
use
more
carbonation
but
overall
it
was
a
very
interesting
farmhouse
ale
d
this
tastes
like
a
sweeter
and
thicker
version
of
belhaven
believe
it
or
not
all
in
all
this
brew
was
not
good
the
flavors
it
did
have
blended
in
a
very
unpleasant
way
dont
bother
hunting
or
trying
if
you
have
access
very
easy
to
drink
this
one
and
it
pairs
nicely
with
all
kinds
of
foods
flavorful
no
doubt
extremely
drinkable
very
close
in
its
clean
maltaccented
nature
to
the
german
march
beer
märzen
lightbodied
moderately
carbonated
easydrinking
and
wonderfully
tasty
this
is
the
perfect
springsummer
brew
while
the
sweetness
could
become
cloying
after
a
while
and
while
the
alcohol
content
is
a
tad
high
for
sessionability
this
brew
is
certainly
poised
for
drinkability
and
refreshment
drinks
really
easy
a
good
take
on
the
style
hopefully
some
fresh
bottles
will
be
around
next
spring
when
im
more
into
this
style
still
holds
up
nicely
on
a
hot
summer
night
a
smooth
and
creamy
beer
with
nice
carbonation
the
smells
and
flavors
were
all
there
and
blended
nicely
a
pretty
solid
beer
a
fluffy
thick
tan
head
sits
atop
a
reddishgolden
brew
decent
retention
with
a
thin
sheet
of
lace
leftover
complex
and
super
sweet
to
the
nose
with
some
sour
fruits
fresh
beer
bread
a
bit
of
citrus
and
tastes
spicy
with
sweet
caramel
middle
and
a
piquant
ending
medium
bodied
and
goes
down
creamy
in
the
middle
with
some
toasted
edges
a
syrupy
sweetness
is
left
on
the
lips
after
it
warms
a
faint
alcohol
heat
is
noticed
but
otherwise
this
beer
is
all
sweet
and
innocent
just
as
it
should
be
t
its
a
very
smooth
and
mild
beer
theres
a
sweetness
there
caramel
or
citrus
maybe
both
good
relaxing
beer
even
if
nothing
truly
jumps
out
d
this
is
a
decent
brew
but
a
little
disappointing
aroma
is
too
faint
and
flavor
a
bit
too
subdued
im
glad
i
tried
it
but
doubt
ill
buy
it
again
very
interesting
beer
i
havent
had
many
beire
de
gardes
so
i
dont
really
have
much
to
compare
this
against
overall
it
is
enjoyable
honey
golden
with
a
dense
white
head
that
leaves
plenty
of
fine
lace
on
the
glass
toasted
grain
and
caramely
fruity
sweetness
and
faint
floral
hop
and
spice
aroma
mild
tasting
with
white
fleshed
fruit
some
faint
belgian
spice
and
mild
toffee
sweetness
balanced
with
slightly
dry
yeast
and
a
mild
noble
hop
bitterness
medium
light
bodied
with
seltzery
carbonation
a
tasty
lighter
beer
thats
good
for
cooling
off
on
a
hot
day
pours
a
yellow
to
orangeish
color
with
a
nice
white
head
in
the
aroma
a
sweet
malltiness
and
somewhat
lager
like
in
the
taste
a
nice
maltiness
and
a
nice
balance
hop
a
smooth
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
and
a
clean
small
hop
aftertaste
a
nice
hop
presence
and
nice
balance
a
very
nice
and
quite
drinkable
ale
thats
remarkably
refined
and
smooth
in
fact
what
this
one
may
be
missing
is
the
very
slightly
rustic
and
unfiltered
character
that
the
artisanal
belgofrench
examples
often
exhibit
its
certainly
apparent
that
the
author
of
farmhouse
ales
truly
knows
his
farmhouse
ales
quite
malty
for
a
farmhouse
ale
prominent
hop
character
the
spice
lends
a
slightly
funky
character
which
i
think
the
hops
are
contributing
to
toasty
and
nutty
flavors
from
restrained
kilning
actually
its
quite
toasty
but
theres
not
much
sign
of
farmhouse
to
be
honest
all
and
all
a
good
beer
an
aquired
taste
but
i
wouldnt
mind
having
another
one
12oz
bottle
served
at
48
degrees
in
my
allagash
chalice
poured
a
translucent
orangegold
with
a
one
inch
loose
bright
white
head
copious
tiny
bubbles
clung
to
edges
of
the
glass
and
effervesced
from
the
base
to
the
underside
of
the
cap
head
eventually
settles
into
a
broken
skim
with
a
few
random
strands
of
lacing
present
during
the
tasting
subtle
nose
some
light
malt
perhaps
a
trace
of
caramel
some
citrus
and
a
grassy
quality
taste
follows
nose
very
tasty
and
lacking
some
of
the
bitterness
ive
come
to
associate
with
beers
of
this
style
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
with
a
lively
carbonation
and
a
somewhat
crisp
finish
a
pretty
nice
beer
i
have
to
say
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
at
how
much
i
enjoyed
it
drinkability
i
would
definitely
have
this
again
i
recommend
this
to
those
seeking
a
solid
and
clean
biere
de
mars
with
a
solid
spice
and
herbal
profile
d
not
bad
overall
just
kind
of
lifeless
drinkability
i
like
the
peachy
funky
combination
a
good
beer
i
could
have
several
of
especially
in
hot
weather
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
had
a
bottle
with
dinner
at
liberty
st
tavern
i
drank
this
with
dinner
and
while
it
was
a
nice
beer
it
wasnt
as
outstanding
as
most
southampton
beers
im
used
too
in
terms
of
belgian
beers
it
was
on
par
with
leffe
it
was
agreeable
but
a
little
sweet
and
without
much
depth
it
had
a
herbal
sweetness
liek
gum
or
tea
and
a
cleaner
amber
bread
flavor
than
you
usually
have
in
a
belgian
good
beer
but
not
great
d
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
its
not
a
brew
that
is
difficult
to
drink
or
anything
just
somewhat
dull
id
still
take
this
over
any
macro
like
corona
or
bud
im
sure
thats
not
something
a
brewery
wants
to
hear
but
thats
how
i
perceived
this
one
i
have
five
more
so
perhaps
there
will
be
something
that
i
dont
notice
in
the
next
few
pours
an
orangish
golden
with
a
finely
beaded
white
head
that
fades
to
a
thin
cap
slightly
grainy
aroma
with
orange
notes
and
a
touch
of
spice
tastes
very
juicy
and
fruity
with
a
nice
orange
peel
bitterness
that
builds
and
some
accents
of
coriander
some
bready
notes
round
it
out
very
refreshing
and
a
wonderful
thirst
quencher
on
a
hot
southern
day
but
with
enough
flavor
to
keep
things
interesting
a
solid
beer
in
a
style
thats
hard
to
find
im
reviewing
a
12
oz
bottle
from
a
sixpack
a
very
nice
thing
to
see
given
the
rarity
of
the
style

heard
a
talk
by
phil
markowski
recently
where
he
explained
the
differences
between
saison
biere
de
garde
and
biere
de
mars
much
subtle
info
i
wasnt
aware
of
quite
interesting
hoping
that
i
can
approach
this
more
aware
next
time
very
yeasty
to
start
with
a
tinge
of
hoppiness
without
any
of
the
balanced
sweet
malts
you
might
expect
from
a
biere
de
garde
generally
speaking
this
beer
screams
spring
and
pairs
very
nicely
with
a
salad
or
something
of
that
sort
only
major
disappointment
was
how
light
the
mouthfeel
was
it
was
nearly
watery
i
had
higher
expectations
for
this
one
glad
to
try
it
none
the
less
where
this
beer
truly
excels
is
in
the
mouthfeel
light
and
crisp
on
the
palate
nice
to
see
the
biere
de
mars
in
12
ounce
bottles
even
though
this
one
is
being
contracted
at
the
old
rolling
rock
brewery
in
latrobe
pa
appears
a
nice
copper
amber
hue
with
a
bright

delicate

with

character
going
on
from
the
yeast
used
also

drinkability
overall
is
tasty
stuff
that
i
appreciate
contract
12
ounce
bottles
of
but
would
much
rater
see
it
in
750ml
bottles
brewed
by
phil
at
sly
fox
royersford
d
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
would
be
great
to
sit
outside
with
on
a
nice
spring
day
the
flavor
is
sweet
grain
malt
with
the
bananas
and
spices
both
showing
up
there
is
a
nice
and
moderate
hop
edge
in
the
center
of
the
profile
that
goes
nicely
with
the
fruit
flavor
the
green
apple
shows
up
with
the
hops
by
way
of
a
slight
and
dry
fermented
fruit
taste
a
little
musky
overall
a
good
and
somewhat
different
spring
beer
maybe
one
of
my
new
go
tos
this
summer
the
mouth
feel
is
medium
with
a
light
and
crisp
finish
only
a
slight
aftertaste
this
is
my
first
from
southampton
and
though
i
would
not
go
out
and
buy
this
beer
regularly
i
am
certainly
now
interested
in
trying
more
offerings
by
them
this
is
a
really
great
beer
very
drinkable
and
an
excellent
accompaniment
to
the
cheese
plate
i
enjoyed
that
evening
d
for
a
beer
that
creeps
up
the
mid
6
abv
mark
its
a
very
drinkable
clean
and
satisfying
ale
perfect
for
pairing
with
pork
and
sharp
cheese
the
cleansing
bready
effect
of
the
malt
profile
used
makes
for
a
superdrinkable
brew
more
french
farmhouse
ales
will
be
in
this
guys
future
pours
a
nice
clear
orangy
amber
with
an
average
offwhite
head
aroma
is
malty
yeasty
and
slightly
fruity
flavor
is
strongly
malty
and
somewhat
fruity
and
has
a
slightly
sweet
undertone
and
a
hint
of
hop
bitterness
smooth
and
rather
fizzy
texture
completes
this
beer
d
nice
and
easy
drinking
super
refreshing
and
lots
of
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
slick
and
with
medium
carbonation
this
beer
isnt
great
but
ill
take
another
right
now
im
not
in
a
picky
mood
tonight
i
guess
its
an
interesting
stab
at
the
style
but
it
couldve
used
a
lot
more
of
a
hop
bite
and
a
more
interesting
malt
profile
to
balance
out
all
the
spiciness
here
d
overall
southampton
biere
de
mars
is
a
beer
that
is
definitely
worth
a
try
dont
know
if
i
like
it
enough
to
purchase
again
but
am
glad
i
tried
it
drinkability
remarkably
interesting
smooth
with
impressive
flavoirs
d
not
bad
its
definitely
drinkable
but
not
anywhere
near
the
best
of
the
best
in
this
style
im
happy
to
have
picked
this
up
and
been
able
to
try
it
but
i
think
its
a
one
and
done
for
me
the
somewhat
off
aromas
and
tastes
kinda
turn
me
off
a
bit
here
had
high
expectations
for
this
and
was
a
bit
let
down
d
this
was
kind
of
a
meh
beer
for
me
not
bad
just
sort
of
blah
id
really
like
to
have
tried
the
version
of
it
shown
in
the
picture
above
overall
impression
this
is
a
french
style
farmhouse
ale
with
some
spices
added
it
is
not
aggressively
spiced
and
they
do
work
with
this
style
rather
well
it
is
an
interesting
inexpensive
brew
so
its
definitely
work
checking
out
d
this
is
a
very
interesting
refreshing
brew
i
like
it
and
think
its
goodbut
even
the
very
minimal
biscuit
doughiness
it
offers
is
almost
a
turnoff
for
me
overall
i
think
this
is
a
great
drinkable
light
refreshing
spicy
biere
de
garde
i
am
happy
it
is
now
offered
in
12
oz
bottles
and
available
in
my
area
while
being
low
in
alcohol
i
dont
think
i
would
go
for
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
sitting
im
not
digging
the
dead
butter
dominating
the
taste
i
thought
this
would
be
somewhat
interesting
but
its
one
sided
as
all
hell
if
some
spices
came
through
this
might
be
appealing
but
for
now
its
in
limbo
d
very
tasty
overall
loved
the
look
the
aroma
was
fine
but
didnt
excite
me
but
the
taste
was
a
pleasant
surprise
and
this
was
a
wellbalanced
very
drinkable
brew
definitely
one
i
recommend
though
i
have
limited
experience
with
the
style
overall
d
goes
down
very
easy
overall
this
was
a
well
done
beer
for
the
style
however
about
midway
through
the
drink
it
became
a
bit
too
onedimensional
still
its
got
no
fatal
flaws
and
is
worth
a
shot
overall
a
nice
beer
for
me
its
a
nice
diversion
from
hoppy
beers
part
of
the
southampton
mixed
12

even
a

not
totally
into
this

but
this
one
isnt
bad
give
me
an
ipa
or
amber
over
this
one
for
sure
but
definitely
drinkable
and
a
good
change
of
pace
beer
for
a
unique
style
d
nice
stuff
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
a
very
decent
and
refreshing
brew
a
great
all
around
beer
that
is
worth
trying
for
sure
ill
certainly
be
buying
more
of
this
one
nicely
drinkable
a
great
beer
for
sitting
in
the
sunshine
pours
a
crystal
clear
copper
color
with
a
short
dense
head
that
dissipates
into
a
sparse
cap
the
aroma
seems
to
be
strong
on
the
coriander
sweet
and
floral
a
nice
sweet
malt
body
that
is
pushed
around
by
the
coriander
flavor
some
pepper
honey
and
a
general
fruity
flavor
not
overly
sweet
seems
to
have
good
balance
to
the
sweetness
the
coriander
is
a
bit
too
present
for
my
liking
a
nice
moderate
body
with
crisp
carbonation
drinks
very
well
finishes
sweet
for
the
most
part
with
perhaps
a
slight
earthy
bitterness
an
enjoyable
brew
but
too
heavy
on
the
coriander
most
of
the
other
flavors
seems
to
be
dominated
by
the
coriander
d
not
bad
at

it
is
deliciosly
complex
but
not
too
dangerous
d
easy
to
drink
refreshing
i
think
this
would
pair
great
with
something
spicy
recommended
to
try
pours
a
cloudy
orange
with
a
massive
white
head
that
lingers
not
much
lacing
the
smell
is
potent
dried
orange
peel
something
savory
like
the
juices
of
a
good
steak
whole
grain
sourdough
marigolds
mineral
tang
the
taste
is
similar
but
not
so
heavy
on
the
citrus
the
malty
qualities
of
grain
with
sourdough
and
marigold
tang
dominate
with
an
exceptionally
rich
malty
aftertaste
and
a
surprisingly
bitter
finish
this
is
one
heck
of
a
complex
beer
its
highly
carbonated
but
not
fizzy
fills
up
the
mouth
very
well
its
too
interesting
to
be

drinkable
definitely
one
to

this
biere
de
garde
being
one
of
my
first
was
a
real
treat
to
try
on
tap
at
american
flatbread
it
was
delivered
to
me
an
amberorange
color
with
a
onefinger
beige
cap
the
retention
of
the
cap
was
great
the
lacing
good
the
aroma
was
of
dried
apricots
barley
pear
and
yeast
the
flavors
were
of
wheat
lots
of
biscuity
malt
light
alcohol
some
honey
sweetness
and
pear
the
dry
and
grainy
flavors
of
the
malt
made
the
alcohol
a
little
pronounced
but
thats
good
for
the
style
the
bitter
finish
lingered
on
my
tongue
the
mouthfeel
was
foamy
and
a
little
rough
the
body
medium
and
the
carbonation
high
enough
to
be
slightly
prickly
a
really
accurate
example
of
the
style
pours
a
clear
golden
orange
color
with
white
head
aroma
is
well
balance
with
hints
of
malt
hops
and
crisp
fruit
flavor
very
similar
being
slightly
watered
down
with
a
nice
amount
of
maltiness
balancing
out
the
hops
and
hints
of
apple
and

compliments
of

a
damn
fine
trader
this
was
an
allaround
solid
brew
it
works
perfectly
as
an
easydrinking
yet
fullflavored
warm
weathertype
beer
my
only
complaint
is
that
the
taste
could
have
been
a
bit
more
complex
and
pronounced
nevertheless
this
was
a
highly
enjoyable
example
of
the
style
drinkability
interesting
and
complex
the
funk
fruit
and
medicinal
herb
qualities
are
very
impressive
pours
a
sunset

yellow

a
fluffy

and
a

sticks
around
for
some
time
nice
webbing
left
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
what
a
great
looking
brew
smell
is
new
to
me
light
cane
sugar
with
lots
of
spice
faint
oak
and
a
good
amount
of
white
grape
aromas
as
well
very
unique
in
the
nose
me
likey
taste
starts
off
with
a
peppery
kick
followed
by
some
pine
hop
and
toasted
grain
a
bit
of
a
caramel
malt
and
honey
towards
the
end
but
not
much
light
to
medium
body
with
a
sharp
carbonation
i
cant
say
ive
had
a
beer
like
this
before
even
though
i
live
in
ny
i
may
not
have
the
opportunity
to
try
this
beer
again
and
i
cant
thank
matt
enough
for
the
opportunity
i
see
this
is
available
in
bottles
as
well
i
would
love
to
get
my
hands
on
one
to
compare
to
the
growler
version
overall
a
beer
ive
wanted
to
try
for
a
while
and
im
glad
i
did
i
was
just
hoping
for
more
tart
or
sour
flavors
i
can
think
of
better
examples
of
the
style
but
this
is
a
quality
example
its
just
not
head
of
the
class

dthis

for

the

is
really
nice
d

interesting
feel
and
the
balance
of
the
spices
make
this
a
nice
treat
on

at
zenos
state
college
pa
guess
the
guys
were
in
town
and
they
loaded
up
3
beers
on
tap
to
enjoy
before
the
moe
concert
right
next
door
later
that
night
the
one
brewer
im
terrible
with
names
sorry
bought
me
a
pint
of
this
fine
beer
thanks
man
i
could
see
right
away
why
he
was
so
excited
about
this
beer
such
a
beautiful
looking
smelling
and
tasting
beer
belgian
complexity
about
pilsner
cleanness
paired
together
in
this
wonderfully
smooth
beer
i
love
this
style
and
dont
get
to
try
too
many
out
here
in
the
styx
this
one
is
very
good
and
im
leaving
work
a
little
early
to
see
if
theres
still
anymore
on
tap
southampton
beers
only
made
their
way
out
here
maybe
a
year
ago
and
they
continue
to
impress
me
fine
job
possibly
the
smoothest
beer
ive
ever
sampled
its
almost
imperceptible
to
the
tongue
its
so
smooth
instantly
tart
but
cut
with
a
resounding
sweetness
of
honey
to
balance
things
out
granny
smith
apples
spring
to
mind
as
does
an
oaked
flanders
ale
earthy
basement
like
taste
in
the
finish
coupled
with
a
long
drawn
out
tartness
that
puckers
the
mouth
this
is
a
classic
drinkability
was
very
high
sph
simply
does
not
make
a
mediocre
beer
top
notch
brew
really
enjoyable
another
winner
thanks
to
nutbrown
pours
out
a
cloudy
golden
orange
with
some
sediment
floating
around
pretty
small
white
bubbly
head
that
leaves
a
bit
of
sticky
lacing
on
the
glass
light
funkiness
with
some
earthy
notes
in
the
aroma
some
tart
fruit
undertones
with
a
bit
of
sweetness
lulrks
beneath
fruit
sweetness
with
a
bit
of
tart
green
apples
start
the
flavor
a
bit
of
earthy
funky
and
yeast
notes
finishes
a
bit
tart
and
funky
bubbly
carbonation
and
smooth
going
down
makes
this
some
easy
drinking
beer
a
fascinating
brew
and
one
im
going
to
have
to
revisit
when
i
get
a
bit
more
familiar
with
the
style
this
might
be
a
good
introduction
to
tart
beers
for
someone
who
isnt
acquainted
with
them
the
malt
can
easily
be
perceived
beneath
the
tartness
big
thanks
to
blitheringidiot
for
bringing
this
all
the
way
from
pa
beer
is
good
happy
farmhouse
beering
mouthfeel
is
smooth
medium
bodied
and
slightly
sticky
not
impressed
wont
try
this
one
again
drinkability
im
liking
this
one
different
for
sure
kinda
like
a
really
laid
back
saison
id
have
another
for
sure
drinkability
and
notes

this
is
a
tasty
beer
from
an
often
overlooked
style
southampton
has
once
again
delivered
a
biere
de
garde
that
while
not
as
refined
has
more
flavor
complexity
than
the
finest
frenchbelgian
examples
available
in
this
country
a
bit
like
maudite
and
lunacy
its
that
sort
of
drinking
experience
which
really
does
not
resonate
with
me
tastes
fruity
and
sweet
with
a
sour
edge
drying
peppery
and
spicy
more
orange
cidery
mouthfeel
is
kind
of
gritty
and
oily
but
not
terribly
offensive
dry
finish
fairly
drinkable
a
complex
and
interesting
flavor
all
around
a
toned
down
saison
and
thats
a
good
thing
primarily
a
sour
at
palate
intense
flavour
not
for
everyone
i
liked
it
but
was
not
expecting
this
citrus
in
aroma
a
wild
take
on
the
actual
style
from
the
rudimentary
few
i
have
had
of
the
style
so
far
750ml

2005
edition
dark
orange
with
a
nice
frothy

of
eggshell
white

ensues
and
is
quite
abundant
in
nature
aromas
are
all
about
the
cracked
white
and
green
pepper
fresh
haylike
grass
aromas
jump
out
and
are
rounded
out
by
some
nice
sweet
germanfrench
maltiness
taste
is
spicy
and
funky
up
front
with
some
gueuze
lambic
notes
and
some
wild
yeastfunk
notes
the
taste
is
rounded
out
by
some
nice
germanfrench
bready
malts
and
some
green
awesome
northern
french
hops
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
slick
turning
dry
in
the
finish
which
is
spicy
pepper
and
everlasting
drinkability
is
intense
and
perfect
for
this
most
unique
and
staggering
brew
wow
sph
is
really
coming
back
into
the
front
of
my
mind
these
days
with
brews
like
this
masterpiece
d
this
is
a
very
interesting
and
complex
beer
that
possesses
many
qualities
of
a
fine
apertif
if
it
werent
for
its
tonguenumbing
qualities
drinkable
in
its
own
right
like
a
glass
of
wine
however
this
beer
would
be
best
suited
when
paired
with
food
mouthfeeldrinkability
a
bit
sharp
and
aggressive
in
the
mouth
with
resulting
big
ass
burps
almost
to
a
detriment
the
beer
mellows
a
little
after
several
minutes
but
this
intensifies
the
punchy
sourness
that
now
has
taken
over
almost
completely
not
an
easy
beer
to
get
through
to
the
end
next
time
i
will
pair
this
one
with
food
as
i
believe
there
is
some
balance
that
needs
to
be
achieved
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
crisp
with
healthy
carbonation
quite
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
this
750ml
is
a
treat
and
i
wouldnt
mind
having
another
a
tasty
well
made
brew
that
does
a
good
job
of
not
going
over
the
top
many
thanks
to
dmeadows
and
goodbyeohio
for
the
bottles
im
glad
i
have
another
in
the
cellar
pours
a
very
hazy
peachy
orange
color
with
a
nice
active
carbonation
the
head
is
sparse
over
top
but
i
avoided
the
agressive
pour
to
keep
the
wee
beasties
out
of
the
beer
this
time
the
nose
is
absolutely
divine
it
has
the
funkey
barnyardy
mustyness
but
its
not
the
dominant
aroma
i
get
lemon
soaked
raisin
and
a
light
graineyness
nothing
too
big
but
working
very
well
as
a
group
flavor
is
very
nice
as
as
well
initial
swallow
gives
a
slightly
tart
musty
feel
but
it
does
not
linger
much
after
the
initial
swallow
i
get
lemony
citrus
and
light
grainey
notes
but
nothing
really
the
aftertase
is
just
slightly
musty
lemoy
and
even
a
touch
sweet
the
feel
is
light
to
moderate
with
a
moderate
carbonation
overall
an
incredily
drinkable
beer
i
like
the
balance
of
all
aspects
this
is
a
style
i
often
find
to
be
a
bit
offensive
but
this
one
is
built
very
well
pours
an
orange
color
with
a
small
head
that
falls
fast
and
doesnt
leave
any
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
subtle
but
has
some
sweetness
and
some
citrus
very
little
funk
the
flavor
caught
me
off
guard
its
got
a
tart
kick
that
i
wasnt
expecting
the
tartness
dies
off
quickly
leaving
a
wellblended
citrus
and
sweetness
mixture
that
does
good
things
for
the
palate
the
body
is
on
the
low
end
of
medium
but
fitting
and
the
drinkability
is
very
good
overall
an
interesting
and
quite
enjoyable
beer
i
could
have
this
one
all
night
long
even
with
all
the
pepper
flavors
i
dont
thik
that
it
is
out
of
balance
or
anything
another

i

myself
putting

of

by

the
best
thing
about
this
beer
was
its
incredible

a

just
a

not
at

develops
a

in

strengthens
as
it
warms

with
a

flavor
and
just
a
delicate
note
of

lingers
into

a

of
this
another
winner
from
southampton
definitely
check
out
this
beer
love
the
big
classy
bottle
as
it
suits
such
a
refined
beer
as
this
mid
dark
gold
with
a
very
fruity
nose
consisting
of
peaches
and
apples
that
are
left
on
the
orchard
floor
the
beer
tastes
very
old
but
young
at
the
same
time
i
loved
the
attention
to
detail
and
the
fact
that
it
tasted
like
straight
from
the
farmhouse
in
france
or
belgium
food
friendly
yet
able
to
stand
alone
as
a

the
flavor
is
a
sweet
citrus
combination
of
orange
tangerine
and
a
clean

flavor
the
beer
taste
rather
crisp
because
of
its
carbonation
the
citrus

leave
a
lingering

baked

and
cloveish
yeast
candyish
donut
sprinkles
somehow
hoppy
too
though
its
subtle
and
definitely
not
ansome
american
hops
rather
yeasty
palate
which
procures
a
moderate
dryness
all
the
way
through
very
surprising
taste
after
smelling
both
are
very
different
with
a
sweet
aroma
and
a
dry
palate
youve
got
to
respect
a
beer
that
surprises
you
still
i
found
cloves
flavors
to
be
a
bit
overstated
but
i
love
the
gentle
mustiness
earthy
and
cerealic
almost
oaty
flavors
nice
balancing
ending
bitterness
lively
carbonation
fluffy
mouthfeel
much
more
flavorfull
than
i
anticipated
great
execution
of
course
cheers
to
biruchan
and
schoolteacher
this
is
an
exceptionally
wellcomposed
replication
of
a
belgian
ale
the
taste
is
comparable
to
light
belgians
such
as
duvel
but
with
a
tart
wheatiness
a
true
pleasure
pours
a
hazy
orangecopper
color
it
is
pretty
well
carbonated
which
supports
an
offwhite
to
tan
colored
head
i
get
sweet
fruity
aromas
of
pear
and
apple
up
front
as
i
dig
deeper
i
get
notes
of
toasted
biscuits
and
malt
plus
some
subtle
spice
notes
as
well
the
beer
is
fairly
dry
up
front
with
an
initially
gassy
middle
and
a
sweet
cider
like
finish
this
is
another
fairly
clean
yet
interestingly
malty
interpretation
of
the
style
almost
has
a
meatychewy
malt
character
to
it
this
is
quite
tasty
and
has
a
hearty
medium
bodied
quality
to
it
that
is
most
likely
from
this
being
an
all
malt
interpretation
of
the
style
the
fruity
yeast
notes
are
nice
though
it
could
perhaps
use
some
more
yeast
spiciness
but
this
is
a
rather
weak
complaint
on
this
otherwise
wonderful
beer
drinkability
wonderful
great
spring
beer
once
you
get
past
the
initial
aroma
the
volatiles
escape
things
settle
and
a
really
very
decent
bière
de
garde
shines
through
a
nice
treat
and
wellworth
trying
and
man
watch
out
for
that
skunkweed
its
pretty
damn
intense
the
beer
extricates
itself
from
the
750ml
green
bottle
an
obfuscated
copper
color
the
head
brontosauric
in
size
creamy
in
texture
and
after
dissolving
the
lace
forms
a
thick
and
clinging
blanket
upon
the
glass
the
nose
has
a
the
aroma
of
over
ripe
apples
with
a
nice
yeast
presence
citrus
crisp
also
notice
a
hint
of
mustiness
a
fine
sniffer
this
one
start
is
lightly
sweet
pleasing
malt
presence
with
the
top
light
to
middling
in
feel
finish
is
ferine
in
its
acidity
the
hops
dynamic
in
their
spiciness
very
dry
aftertaste
a
very
fine
representative
to
the
style
quite
pleasing
to
the
palate
and
a
great
beer
to
share
on
fathers
day
with
all
the

the
body
is
pretty
big
but
not
huge
the
flavor
is
absolutely
wonderful
dark
sweet
fruits
and
balance
well
with
spices
there
is
a
big
malt
presence
but
the
spices
and
herbs
really
make
for
an
interesting
experience
it
is
very
smooth
and
rich
as
the
temperature
starts
to
rise
it
becomes
even
more
deliteful
this
is
yet
another

southampton

with
a

when
smelling
medium

the

about
2
inches

which
always
makes
the
beer
look
more
presentable
it
was
pretty
sour
in
my
opinion
cloudysediment
on

because
of
the

was
also
a

of

dense

with

to

of

very

alcohol
is
extremely
well
hidden
nothing
but
a
slight
warming
after
the
finish
overall
an
excellent
biere
de
garde
great
balance
and
complexity
i
definitely
would
like
to
try
out
more
from
this
style
the
aroma
was
rich
and
malty
lots
of
caramel
and
light
bready
notes
coming
through
almost
immediatly
with
a
light
punch
of
grain
tucked
in
behind
them
and
a
light
nose
of
peach
poking
up
beyond
that
the
flavor
was
more
of
the
same
light
touches
of
peaches
and
apricots
perhaps
a
touch
of
fresh
grassy
notes
that
were
sitting
on
top
a
nice
bit
lo
light
grain
intresting
touch
of
caramel
on
the
initial
sip
that
quickly
mellowed
out
behind
the
light
fruit
notes
which
combined
with
a
long
dry
finish
really
helped
push
the
malt
profile
to
the
forefront
nice
carbonation
kept
this
one
feeling
lively
throughout
the
session
with
a
medium
bodied
feel
that
was
just
heavy
enough
to
coat
the
tongue
easily
a
sessionable
ale
i
got
a
thick
tawny
two
fingers
of
head
off
of
my
initial
pour
but
they
did
not
last
long
disappearing
in
a
wake
of
sticky
lacing
color
was
a
deep
amber
with
nequality
clarity
more
bupgoo
nose
was
very
maltycerealbiscuity
underlain
with
a
good
bit
of
must
it
really
smelled
like
old
magazines
in
my
grummys
basement
yow
mouthfeel
was
was
slightly
viscous
and
i
got
a
wild
initial
taste
of
childrens
cough
medicine
that
was
not
a
negative
but
instead
a
trip
down
memory
lane
it
was
the
slightly
hot
malt
flavor
that
really
sent
me
finish
was
a
musty
malty
flavor
that
simply
lingered
well
after
the
swallow
i
cupped
my
hands
and
i
could
taste
bliss
come
back
honey
on
tap
dark
amber
to
light
brown
with
a
small
white
head
that
doesnt
retain
much
aromas
are
lacking
a
little
but
i
get
faint
earth
and
barely
sweetened
maltiness
flavors
are
earthy
with
citrus
rind
fruitiness
and
bitterness
at
the
back
mouthfeel
is
relatively
light
and
dry
id
definitely
try
this
one
again
d
overall
a
nice
combination
of
mouthfeel
and
taste
makes
the
beer
pretty
nice
overall
a
pretty
easy
drinking
beer
and
a
nice
one
to
open
the
spring
with
750ml
bottles
from
2008
sly
fox
offering
enormous
difference
from
the
first
and
second
pour
as
the
yeast
from
the
bottom
changes
the
beers
character
significantly
first
pour
is
a
clear
dark
amber
big
nose
of
caramel
and
butterscotch
malty
faintly
metallic
flavor
a
little
spicy
and
grassy
second
pour
is
cloudy
and
the
head
has
tiny
little
bubbles
still
alot
of
caramel
on
the
nose
though
more
freshlybaked
bread
and
yeast
yeasty
spicy
character
with
a
sweeping
kick
at
the
end
really
earthy
pungent
and
raw
beautiful
toward
thre
end
of
the
bottle
i
would
almost
like
to
shake
up
the
whole
bottle
next
time
to
get
the
yeast
moving
throughout
mouthfeel
felt
rough
good
carb
medium
body
but
not
creamy
more
muddy
i
wouldnt
care
to
try
this
again
unless
it
was
a
fresh
bottle
at
the
publick
house
not
my
thing
and
i
love
a
good
bdeg
excellent
farmhouse
ale
d
good
drinkability
the
abv
seems
perfectly
manageable
making
this
six
pack
worthy
malty
sweet
dry
and
fruity
makes
for
a
very
enjoyable
downer
this
is
a
very
sweet
version
of
the
style
with
lots
of
malts
and
fruit
which
forces
the
dry
earthiness
to
the
back
very
complex
and
tasty
750ml
bomber
this
one
pours
a
cloudy
orangedark
golden
color
there
was
a
bit
of
an
effervescent
tan
head
on
it
that
dropped
away
rather
quickly
nice
aroma
somewhat
fruity
grassy
and
floral
a
touch
yeasty
also
very
nice
taste
a
touch
of
tartness
is
up
front
not
too
heavy
of
a
body
caramel
and
fruit
apples
and
lemon
notes
on
the
tongue
just
a
touch
of
spices
too
very
nice
this
one
is
nicely
refreshing
on
a
warm
evening
crisp
and
refreshing
ontap
at
tap
and
table
in
emmaus
pa
for
5tulip
the
beer
appeared
a
clear
amber
with
no
head
the
first
thing
that
struck
me
was
the
lack
of
carbonation
that
might
have
been
more
of
the
bars
fault
but
it
really
hampered
this
brew
otherwise
the
malt
is
a
light
and
dry
toffee
and
bread
flavor
the
hops
and
yeast
pop
up
in
the
background
with
bitter
orange
peel
and
funky
farmhouse
lemon
despite
the
mouthfeel
literally
falling
flat
this
is
a
very
respectable
beer
and
worth
a
try
still
good
and
drinkable
but
just
not
alot
going
on
slight
diacetyl
flavors
with
again
that
same
muted
malt
that
was
in
the
aroma
lacking
fruit
qualities
and
no
hints
of
hop
just
not
that
great
drinkability
is
great
find
my
self
enjoying
this
one
more
as
the
bottle
goes
buy
complex
interesting
malty
treat
with
a
little
musty
funk
what
more
could
you
ask
for
d
drinkability
is
good
overall
this
brew
is
not
quite
what
i
had
in
mind
going
into
it
first
like
the
aroma
the
flavor
is
a
little
underwhelming
for
the
style
having
gotten
over
the
is
it
to
style
hurdle
this
is
still
a
solid
beer
at
face
value
the
flavors
work
well
together
the
alcohol
works
wonderfully
to
keep
it
warm
and
inviting
sip
after
sip
dont
let
the
final
score
on
this
one
fool
you
its
good
enough
that
i
could
see
myself
having
this
again
and
am
actually
pretty
stoked
i
got
try
this
one
out
for
a
first
time
a
little
watery
to
be
honest
the
thick
aroma
and
subsequently
hearty
flavor
deserve
a
tactile
sensation
with
slightly
more
backbone
a
fine
brew
just
give
it
a
little
more
structure
pleasantly
surpassed
my
expectations
my
recommendation
is
to
let
this
one
sit
for
a
year
and
serve
over
45
degrees
it
was
more
enjoyable
as
it
warmed
d
very
tasty
brew
and
interesting
7

isnt
too
big
but
i
think
this
bottle
would
be
best
split
with
another
person
a
wonderful
beer
with
lots
of
aromas
and
taste
floating
around
i
could
use
just
a
little
more
funk
in
the
taste
but
thats
just
a
minor
item
after
finishing
the
beer
overall
this
is
a
good
biere
de
garde
but
no
aspect
stands
out
as
exceptional
worth
a
shot
this
is
an
enjoyable
offering
to
sip
but
perhaps
not
as
enjoyable
as
intended
a
little
bit
choppy
in
its
sourness
and
if
not
disjointed
a
little
heavy
at
times
france
hasnt
contributed
anywhere
near
as
much
to
beer
as
it
has
to
wine
arguably
its
only
contribution
overlooking
the
method
champagnoise
is
the
biere
de
garde
a
sadly
underrepresented
style
that
can
offer
complexity
in
subtlety
like
few
others
perhaps
the
reasons
so
few
new
age
brewers
attempt
the
style
is
that
very
fact
it
is
terribly
difficult
to
achieve
complexity
through
subtlety
in
any
case
southampton
has
succeeded
a
very
nice
beer
and
one
of
the
best
ive
had
of
the
style
a
great
introduction
to
the
southampton
line
drinkability
generally
recommended
provided
youre
a
fan
of
the
style
i
would
certainly
appreciate
a
slackened
carbonation
but
otherwise
its
a
tasty
bière
de
garde
pours
a
cloudy
light
orange
color
with
a
frothy
one
finger
head
smells
of
light
fruits
with
plum
fruits
dominating
nose
first
sip
is
plums
and
other
fruits
mixing
not
well
with
the
massive
yeast
favor
there
is
way
too
much
carbonation
here
and
too
much
yeast
im
guessing
it
is
bottle
conditioned
but
too
much
sugar
was
used
i
am
not
impressed
d
not
sessionable
but
if
i
had
a
bottle
i
would
probably
share
it
as
this
one
did
not
appeal
to
me
all
that
great
this
had
a
great
feel
off
the
tap
with
a
decent
flavor
just
is
not
my
style
fluffy
and
billowing
head
of
meringuelike
foam
it
deflates
slowly
leaving
concentric
rings
and
has
a
slight
luster
on
its
surface
initial
pour
had
3
fingers
of
foam
and
still
had
1
after
10
minutes
color
was
ruddy
orange
hazy
with
microsediment
musty
sweet
grain
aroma
with
a
nice
complimentary
applepear
sweetness
flavor
had
familiar
elements
of
both
belgian
pale
tripel
woven
into
a
somewhat
sweet
farmhouse
character
slight
oxidation
was
present
buttery
bread
with
honey
mineral
tart
apple
belgian
yeast
prickly
carbonation
with
a
tart
apple
snap
this
poured
a
cloudy
copper
color
with
fluffy
light
tan
head
it
smelled
like
sweet
fresh
hay
and
bready
yeast
and
earthy
caramel
with
some
cream
and
oranges
and
oiled
leather
it
tasted
like
whole
grain
wheat
and
bready
yeast
with
some
cashew
and
cream
and
leather
and
a
bit
of
citrus
hops
and
sweet
caramel
it
was
watery
with
moderate
carbonation
and
had
a
delicate
sweet
and
sour
aftertaste
overall
this
was
a
great
first
impression
for
this
style
of
beer
it
smelled
and
tasted
great
with
very
delicate
and
clean
character
it
was
a
little
light
in
the
body
for
my
taste
but
it
still
hid
the
alcohol
well
and
was
quite
easy
to
drink
i
loved
this
fresh
and
the
bottle
suggests
that
it
will
improve
with
age
wow
d
surprisingly
as
it
continues
it
becomes
more
and
more
drinkable
however
the
head
itself
does
keep
you
from
pouring
it
and
drinking
it
within
5
minutes
of
each
other
this
is
a
pretty
drinkable
if
forgettable
biere
de
garde
certainly
worth
the
try
the
taste
is
very
sour
at
the
start
then
sweet
on
finish
very
lemony
and
citrus
some
orange
as
well
then
a
backlash
of
light
hops
come
and
over
the
top
hops
and
over
the
top
malts
that
comes
at
you
like
a
tsunami
with
tons
of
caramel
flavors
incredibly
sweet
champagne
taste
really
sprizty
at
the
end
my
first
offering
from
southampton
pours
a
nice
golden
orange
with
a
pleasing
creamy
head
the
head
is
brief
but
is
easily
coaxed
back
up
with
a
bit
of
swirling
no
lacing
not
a
bad
looking
beer
not
remarkable
either
smell
is
very
malty
sweet
taste
is
similar
fairly
close
to
a
tripel
and
moreso
as
the
beer
warms
sweet
little
to
no
hop
presence
slightly
warming
alcohol
initially
mouthfeel
seems
a
bit
sharp
or
highly
carbonated
but
this
diminishes
quickly
a
bit
thin
a
bit
watery
but
lends
itself
well
to
sizable
droughts
it
did
not
take
long
at
all
to
kill
this
bottle
and
while
drinkability
is
fine
there
was
nothing
that
left
me
with
the
yearning
to
have
another
bottle
any
time
soon
drinkability
is
ok
just
like
most
of
the
beer
after
drinking
the
saison
deluxe
and
the
grand
cru
i
was
pretty
pumped
to
try
this
one
those
two
beers
amazed
me
some
of
the
best
beers
ive
gotten
to
try
in
a
good
while
this
one
disappoints
it
isnt
a
bad
beer
it
just
does
not
wow
d
the
sweetness
was
a
bit
overwhelming
didnt
like
the
flavor
combination
a
whole
lot
would
enjoy
more
of
a
focus
on
the
fruit
and
less
on
the
sweetness
maybe
with
more
of
a
lighter
toasted
malt

maybe
with
age
this
beer
will
improve
but
i
did
not
find
anything
unique
about
the
brew
i
was
expecting
some
more
funk
from
a
farmhouse
ale
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
it
just
seems
a
bit
off
to
me
the
smell
is
quite
sweet
the
taste
is
quite
grainy
im
not
wild
about
the
diacetyl
that
shows
up
here
and
there
either
its
ok
but
i
doubt
id
come
back
to
it
d
it
is
a
complex
and
tasty
brew
that
was
a
joy
to
drink
however
it
is
more
of
a
sipper
than
a
session
beer
d
a
little
tasty
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
decent
kick
good
representation
of
style
its
a
decent
beer
but
its
certainly
not
one
of
the
first
belgian
beers
that
i
would
look
for
drinkability
moderate
d
decent
beer
overall
but
not
as
awesome
as
i
thought
it
would
be
its
a
nice
chance
to
try
another
biere
de
garde
though
7
is
barely
detectable
wouldnt
mind
having
this
again
d
not
bad
another
tasty
treat
from
the
boys
in
ny
bottle
from
capones
in
norristown
pa
driven
across
the
country
and
popped
tonight
in
ca
pours
a
reddish
brown
slightly
cloudy
foams
up
largely
a
bit
of
an
overflow
actually
because
i
wasnt
paying
close
attention
with
a
big
white
head
smells
mildly
spiced
sweetly
malty
with
grassy
hops
and
coriander
taste
is
a
growing
effervescent
malt
with
a
nice
grainy
coriander
flavor
hops
are
spicy
on
the
back
end
along
with
a
tart
ghost
of
alcohol
creamy
slightly
cottony
mouthfeel
feels
big
for
the
style
drinks
easily
and
tastes
good
though
i
think
that
it
doesnt
have
much
to
set
it
apart
from
others
of
the
style
in
all
a
fine
beer
easy
to
drink
good
for
sipping
even
when
you
dont
best
of
all
for
me
its
a
good
beer
to
toss
in
the
cellar
and
enjoy
whenever
the
hell
ya
feel
like
it
d
now
that
ive
down
one
of
these
right
off
the
rack
its
time
to
pick
up
another
and
cellar
to
see
if
i
can
get
more
flavor
out
of
southampton
recieved
in
a
trade
with
gregc
huge
frothy
head
that
lasted
a
fair
amount
of
time
lots
of
belgian
lace
a
light
copper
colored
beer
armoma
of
malt
and
belgian
yeast
aroma
doesnt
do
a
whole
lot
to
the
beer
but
the
flavor
was
wonderful
very
malty
with
good
sugar
carmelazation
and
a
toasted
malt
taste
mild
hop
bitterness
a
very
well
balanced
and
drinkable
beer
this
beer
has
a
complex
crisp
toasty
malt
flavor
my
first
taste
of
a
southampton
beer
im
looking
forward
to
trying
more
in
the
future
pours
deep
amber
with
a
torrent
of
carbonation
and
a
vast
fluffy
head
the
aroma
is
sour
and
musty
with
strong
malt
the
flavor
is
powerful
malty
with
sour
and
bitter
character
suggesting
leather
and
earth
there
is
a
hint
of
spiced
pear
on
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
rich
and
assertive
this
is
a
delicious
beer
but
rather
overwhelming
a
nicely
carbonated
beer
southamptons
biere
de
garde
is
mild
mellow
very
tasty
and
highly
drinkable
tartness
in
the
flavor
again
pretty
much
a
repeat
of
the
aroma
with
the
toasty
grain
and
the
light
fruitiness
medium
bodied
with
decent
carbonation
the
light
tart
fruit
flavors
linger
for
a
while
pours
a
rich
amber
with
a
light
white
head
smell
is
bright
fruity
and
sweet
breadiness
taste
is
sweet
aged
fruity
and
very
bready
again
without
much
spice
coming
through
for
me
still
pretty
tasty
i
am
somewhat
disappointed
as
i
was
sort
of
hoping
this
biere
would
blow
me
away
since
i
have
heard
such
good
things
about
this
brewery
it
is
still
damn
good
and
supremely
drinkable
just
not
the
masterpiece
i
had
built
up
in
my
head
expect
a
good
biere
de
garde
and
you
wont
be
disappointed
750ml
bottle
thanks
dyan
with
a
best
by
date
of
112012
which
is
still
a
ways
off
id
save
it
but
im
sure
everyone
will
be
drinking
vertical
epic
all
year
in
2012
anyway
this
beer
gave
a
nice
pop
when
the
cork
flew
out
and
it
began
to
foam
immediately
but
i
was
able
to
subdue
the
unruly
bastard
with
a
snifter
nice
orangebrown
haze
with
an
offwhite
foamy
pillow
the
smell
was
real
nice
malt
honey
caramel
the
taste
hmmm
id
say
there
is
a
slight
caramel
flavor
maybe
some
hops
hiding
out
but
this
is
very
subtle
or
my
palate
sucks
this
is
actually
pretty
enjoyable
to
drink
im
really
not
qualified
to
say
whether
this
is
a
good
example
of
the
style
but
it
is
a
good
beer
lacking
complexity
and
heavy
on
the
malt
d
not
bad
just
not
as
complex
or
enjoyable
as
the
other
belgianfarmhouse
styles
i
have
tried
by
southhampton
i
poured
this
into
a
tulip
glass
it
was
a
really
active
and
unruly
beer
but
once
it
settled
down
it
was
an
amber
color
with
a
thick
offwhite
head
that
dissipated
quickly
it
had
a
fruity
sweet
aroma
alcohol
was
noticeable
it
tasted
fruity
and
yeasty
quite
bubbly
in
the
mouth
good
example
of
its
style
pours
a
beautifuol
glowing
orange
with
a
touch
of
haze
and
a
very
full
white
head
that
settles
to
a
ring
relatively
sweet
smell
for
the
style
and
very
fruity
with
pineapple
wildflower
honey
and
cream
delicious
with
some
of
those
same
fruit
notes
as
well
as
some
coconut
notes
beeswax
and
a
touch
of
white
pepper
i
really
like
this
even
though
it
is
still
a
touch
sweet
for
the
style
mostly
crisp
and
peppery
in
the
mouth
but
the
finish
is
creamier
just
a
delight
to
drink
pretty
much
anything
in
abomber
from
these
guys
is
great
works
well
as
an
introduction
to
the
style
and
as
something
to
search
out
if
you
like
the
style
definitely
in
the
upper
range
on
malt
which
is
really
what
i
nick
the
drinkability
score
for
and
the
aroma
while
nice
is
kinda
restrained
give
it
a
shot
my
pint
was
poured
with
minimal
head
but
was
still
covered
by
a
fine
offwhite
layer
of
foam
that
showed
good
retention
and
produced
some
streaky
lacing
the
beer
itself
was
a
clear
gold
colour
mild
aroma
overall
a
combination
of
fruit
and
a
bit
of
citrus
plus
grainy
malt
and
grass
mild
bitterness
balanced
towards
malty
sweetness
with
cereal
notes
and
light
fruit
character
a
bit
grassy
and
citrusy
with
pepperyspicy
alcohol
appearing
towards
the
finish
medium
bodied
with
fine
nearly
crisp
carbonation
good
texture
i
liked
the
balance
of
flavours
and
thought
it
made
for
a
tasty
pint
recommended
nose
is
nicely
spicy
definitely
caramel
jumps
out
immediately
fine
bubbles
convey
an
interesting
take
on
a
saisonstyle
deeply
caramelized
fruitiness
domintaing
over
the
herbalspice
notes
pears
apricot
cloves
it
is
certainly
delicious
but
different
than
i
expected
i
would
liek
to
try
more
bieres
de
garde
to
compare
i
have
only
had
a
handfull
of
this
style
of
beer
so
i
grabbed
one
todaypoured
into
an
oversized
wine
glass
a
russett
color
with
a
deep
orange
hue
to
it
a
thick
foamy
that
left
globs
of
lace
behind
head
atop
toastrd
grain
aromas
along
with
hints
of
pear
and
vanilla
and
very
slight
clovewow
this
has
a
prickly
feel
to
it
not
a
fan
of
thatflavors
are
nice
with
some
wet
grain
element
to
it
with
lingering
spice
and
caramelized
pear
its
a
pretty
good
beer
but
that
mouthfeel
takes
away
alot
from
the
flavor
aspect
and
takes
away
a
bit
from
the
drinkability
very
clean
spicy
and
efforvescent
perhaps
a
bit
too
clean
the
beer
gives
a
very
dry
airy
crisp
maltiness
not
to
be
outdone
by
the
esters
and
phenols
fruitiness
of
peaches
pears
and
appricots
give
a
welcome
sweetness
to
the
acidity
the
phenolics
play
a
bit
like
plastics
and
spicy
cloves
somewhat
vineous
not
as
funky
or
musty
as
i
like
in
the
style
but
takes
on
a
more
saison
style
with
a
hearty
toasted
malt
flavor
very
prickly
on
the
toung
and
evaporates
quickly
light
and
refreshing

overall
thanks
to
himerman
for
another
good
one
i
liked
this
beer
southampton
hasnt
let
me
down
yet
poured
from
a
750
series
bottle
which
exploded
with
foam
when
i
opened
it
and
continued
gushing
slowly
for
about
10
minutes
the
beer
was
copper
brown
colored
slightly
hazy
with
thick
and
dry
looking
foam
clumps
of
which
stuck
to
the
glass
the
aroma
was
mostly
toasted
malts
and
honestly
it
grew
on
me
over
the
course
of
a
few
glasses
not
really
complex
but
a
nice
study
in
malt
flavoring
medium
mouthfeel
easy
to
drink
not
incredibly
challenging
for
the
palate
but
nice
anyway
copper
colored
beer
with
nice
two
finger
head
that
relents
to
a
significant
lacing
the
beer
smells
intensely
malty
to
an
extent
that
overpowers
anything
else
the
taste
is
also
intensely
malty
with
very
pleasant
caramelization
a
mild
hop
bitterness
and
hop
flavor
is
slightly
detectable
this
beer
has
a
complex
crisp
toasty
malt
flavor
my
first
impression
was
that
it
seemed
overpoweringly
malty
but
my
i
recently
gave
it
another
try
and
i
appreciated
the
complex
nature
of
the
caramelized
malts
much
more
perhaps
the
second
bottle
was
better
kept
andor
served
colder
which
helped
subdue
the
sweetness
from
the
malt
and
help
me
appreciate
the
complex
flavor
profile
this
beer
has
a
crisp
medium
body
and
beer
goes
down
well
presenting
different
characteristics
with
each
sip
good
beer
pours
a
textbook
amber
color
with
a
righteous
full
finger
foamy
eggshell
colored
head
that
resists
fading
the
smell
is
incredible
malty
lightly
toasted
sweet
and
fruity
now
do
that
well
carbonated
the
mouth
feel
is
full
and
incredibly
vibrant
effervescent
yet
grounded
in
an
earthy
malt
texture
wow
the
complexity
is
kickedup
notchesseriously
worth
your
consideration
especially
if
you
can
find
it
over
the
holidays
full
flavored
the
earthy
amber
malt
over
heavens
of
carbonated
creaminess
delivers
the
goods
baby
highly
recommended
cheers
a
really
fantastic
beer
one
ill
be
picking
up
again
in
the
near
future
when
i
named
the
best
american
practitioners
of
belgianstyle
ales
in
my
review
of
the
lost
abbeys
red
barn
ale
last
month
i
neglected
to
mention
phil
markowski
his
grand
cru
and
saison
deluxe
are
some
of
the
best
ive
had
from
this
country
biere
de
garde
while
good
isnt
anywhere
near
that
special
im
willing
to
chalk
it
up
to
batch
variation
and
will
buy
another
750
if
i
get
the
chance
750
ml
bottle
no
bottling
date
but
ive
had
it
for
about
a
year
maybe
a
little
more
bottle
poured
a
deep
orangey
color
ale
with
a
big
nice
foamy
head
with
some
good
retention
but
minimal
lacing
aroma
of
spices
which
may
come
from
the
yeast
strain
that
was
used
with
some
noticeable
malt
leaning
toward
more
dry
flavour
then
sweetness
taste
is
also
dominated
by
some
peppery
notes
with
a
nice
malt
presence
with
some
subtle
sweet
notes
body
is
quite
full
with
some
great
carbonation
interesting
and
very
good
overall
but
it
just
seems
that
something
is
missing
extraordinarily
refreshing
on
a
hot
september
afternoon
the
flavor
seems
a
little
nondescript
but
maybe
others
are
more
inspiring
not
my
favorite
from
southampton
would
be
easy
to
pair
a
meal
with
this
as
it
would
be
unlikely
to
offend
got
in
a
trade
with
johnnnniee
many
thanks
poured
from
a
750ml
corked
and
caged
bottle
into
my
dt
snifter
back
label
had
a
brief
story
on
beer
it
was
a
copper
color
with
tons
of
carb
and
a
little
bit
of
floating
yeast
it
had
a
massive
offwhite
head
that
settled
into
a
thick
collar
and
film
a
little
lacing
the
aroma
was
musty
with
dark
fruits
and
sugary
alcohol
kinda
smelled
like
a
lighter
belgian
strong
dark
ale
was
expected
it
to
be
more
like
a
saison
so
was
disappointed
the
taste
was
fruity
a
little
bready
and
a
bit
too
much
alcohol
a
bit
on
the
bland
side
the
mouthfeel
was
good
but
any
more
carb
would
have
been
bad
overall
its
a
good
beer
but
not
my
style
3

rb
y
o
this
is
a
rich
complex
ale
that
is
made
to
be
savored
not
drunk
with
haste
well
done
enjoyable
and
worth
seeking
out
if
you
are
a
fan
of
the
style
very
authentic
for
us
brewery
but
then
again
phil
wrote
the
book
this
is
my
second
southampton
beer
and
my
first
from
the
750
series
i
cant
hardly
wait
to
try
the
others
i
picked
up
a
very
solid
enjoyable
biere
de

mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
a
bit
slick
with
the
beer
leaving
a
bit
of
a
coating
on
my
tongue
this
actually
helps
to
give
this
a
bit
of
a
long
finish
drinkability
is
really
damn
good
give
me
a
few
more
bottles
of
this
and
youll
make
my
day
the
beer
pours
a
dark
goldamber
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
nice
pale
and
crystal
malt
scent
along
with
a
bit
of
bisquit
malt
and
a
fruity
yeast
aroma
it
seems
to
have
a
nice
toasted
feel
the
taste
is
good
as
well
it
has
a
really
smooth
toasted
flavor
with
a
yeasty
finish
its
a
bit
sweet
and
bisquity
which
blends
well
and
creates
an
excellent
balance
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
great
drinking
beer
its
loaded
with
malt
flavor
and
has
just
enough
fruit
esters
to
round
it
out

believe
me
id
have
a
couple
of
these
over
bmc
but
is
that
the
standard
i
dont
think
so
looking
forward
to
more
great
southampton
brews
in
the
future
a
side
note
i
have
had
a
few
bottles
of
southamptons
corked
beers
that
were
infectedcorkednot
stored
correctly
perhaps
this
is
another
one
of
those
bottles
ill
have
to
revisit
this
if
my
next
bottle
it
different
pours
a
surprisingly
clear
amber
with
a
fluffy
sticky
voluminous
laceleaving
head
of
slightly
offwhite
on
the
nose
theres
some
slight
funk
along
with
a
huge
buttery
note
that
dominates
the
proceedings
in
the
background
there
are
some
bits
that
remind
me
of
some
kind
toasty
caramelized
baked
treat
on
the
palate
very
sharp
carbonation
and
bitterness
off
the
bat
with
some
herbal
fennellish
notes
and
citric
acidity
at
the
midpalate
full
rounded
flavors
and
huge
carbonation
make
this
quite
true
to
style
excellent
go
get
some
if
you
like
phils
saisons
you
will
not
be
disappointed
overall
a
drinkable
beer
but
not
a
remarkable
beer
o
nothing
to
look
for
in
here
next
o
an
interesting
brew
with
a
great
fruity
flavor
profile
i
really
enjoyed
this
o
couldve
been
a
bit
more
robust
but
overall
a
decent
bier
de
garde
riding
the
fine
line
between
drain
pour
and
latent
redemption
that
is
never
realized
resides
a
beer
that
should
probably
throw
in
the
towel
before
it
finds
itself
falling
off
the
ledge
of
no
return
for
good
othis
beer
has
a
nice
appearance
with
a
light
smell
taste
and
mouthfeel
that
leaves
the
drinker
refreshed
without
the
overwhelming
flavors
some
beers
are
known
for
atmosphere
is
decent
interesting
hue
nice
head
no
real
lacing
nose
is
nutty
with
some
strange
sweet
notes
woody
malt
flavor
with
a
slight
bitterness
and
hop
overall
this
is
a
decent
quaff
o
overall
this
is
a
nice
drinkable
beer
not
the
top
of
the
line
up
for
southern
star
but
a
quality
beer
the
body
is
light
but
with
a
particular
thickness
to
it
its
got
a
crispness
that
leads
to
a
creamy
mouthfilling
smoothness
2
75
seems
high
for
an
overall
it
tastes
like
the
shit
beer
we
drink
here
in
nj
you
know
when
were
16
im
a
grown
ass
alcoholic
now
cmon
no
really
though
this
is
pretty
awful
tastes
pretty
much
like
a
ok
thats
the
best
they
had
on
tap
at
the
dive
but
id
still
rather
drink
rolling
rocks
in
bottles
o
overall
not
a
bad
beer
reminds
me
of
a
belgian
style
strongquad
but
much
lighter
easy
drinking
interesting
take
on
the
season
id
give
it
a
try
if
you
enjoy
the
style
o
i
think
a
little
more
hops
could
have
brought
a
lot
more
to
this
it
goes
down
easy
but
i
would
have
enjoyed
more
complexity
i
didnt
really
get
those
farmhouse
flavors
i
would
expect
from
this
style
this
beer
is
just
a
bit
under
attenuated
for
my
palette
i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
would
drink
it
again
i
think
it
is
great
that
breweries
make
the
effort
to
brew
beers
like
this
maltier
beers
tend
not
to
fly
off
the
shelf
like
the
latest
ipa
o
sweet
and
candylike
pours
a
hazy
burnt
orange
with
no
real
head
just
a
thin
brown
covering
that
fades
quickly
the
smell
is
sweet
fruity
with
a
hint
of
alcohol
and
malt
taste
is
almost
a
weak
barleywiine
not
so
much
biere
de
grade
and
as
you
sip
a
bit
more
malt
like
characters
come
out
the
beer
isnt
as
sweet
as
the
smell
would
indicate
starts
with
the
fruit
and
barleywine
characteristics
and
finishes
with
the
malt
characters
a
solid
medium
mouthfeel
borders
on
going
heavy
but
a
smooth
beer
the
flavor
isnt
overpowering
overall
a
good
beer
nothing
amazing
but
still
tasty
not
a
typical
for
the
style
but
good
nonetheless
o
i
didnt
really
like
this
one
too
sticky
and
sweet
for
the
style
with
no
real
balance
glad
i
tried
it
but
not
disappointed
i
dont
have
it
regularly
available
to
me
3
5
d
this
is
a
very
tasty
beer
but
the
taste
could
you
some
more
power
and
the
nose
could
use
a
lot
still
i
enjoyed
this
much
overall
this
is
a
very
good
reddish
beer
my
only
complaint
is
that
the
flavor
wasnt
stronger
southern
star
is
usually
known
for
having
a
kick
and
this
one
while
great
didnt
possess
as
much
of
a
kick
as
the
pine
belt
ale
and
the
buried
hatchet
other
than
that
good
contribution
to
the
line
up
from
the
conroe
brewery
o
im
not
a
fan
of
this
beer
its
really
thin
and
the
flavors
are
all
over
the
place
im
not
sure
how
many
other
biere
de
gardes
ive
had
before
but
i
just
cant
imagine
that
this
is
a
good
example
of
the
style
overall
this
is
pretty
average
effort
at
the
style
its
decent
drinkable
stuff
but
im
not
going
to
seek
it
out
at
inflated
seasonal
pricing
o
an
easy
drinking
good
shot
at
a
biere
de
garde
frenchy
beer
from
texas
the
taste
is
pleasant
it
is
also
unusual
unlike
anything
i
am
not
sure
if
i
ever
had
this
style
before
maybe
once
i
would
buy
it
again
i
am
no
sure
if
it
is
a
good
value
it
seems
to
keep
well
in
the
can
the
beer
pours
a
cloudy
dark
copper
with
a
thin
off
white
head
that
quickly
vanished
the
smell
reminds
me
of
fresh
peaches
with
some
caramel
malt
a
hint
of
apples
and
spice
it
tastes
sweet
and
bready
with
a
hint
of
green
apple
and
caramel
its
medium
bodied
and
smooth
with
very
low
carbonation
i
thought
this
beer
was
good
all
around
but
could
definitely
improve
in
some
areas
fairly
bland
the
sweetness
dialed
up
a
bit
without
anything
to
balance
them
out
o
overall
this
beer
is
slightly
above
average
the
qualities
arent
bad
just
kinda
one
note
glad
to
try
but
something
i
wouldnt
seek
out
again
a
little
more
carbonation
would
be
nice
though
this
beer
has
a
lot
of
good
qualities
but
the
mouthfeel
has
a
lot
to
be
desired
o
a
pretty
solid
beer
but
nothing
really
special
does
make
a
good
beer
for
a
hot
day
light
head
that
dissipates
quickly
toastysweet
smell
not
strong
but
evident
not
a
lot
of
hops
but
malty
i
dont
know
what
this
style
should
taste
like
but
the
flavors
seem
a
bit
muted
im
getting
a
feel
for
what
i
should
be
tasting
but
its
not
really
coming
through
mouthfeel
is
thin
i
love
everything
else
for
southern
star
but
this
one
is
a
miss
very
drinkable
but
it
doesnt
fit
the
style
profile
described
pours
an
opaque
brown
color
with
a
tall
khaki
colored
head
sort
of
watery
and
bland
overall
but
there
is
a
mildly
interesting
aroma
of
fruit
and
yeast
some
bready
malt
is
also
present
moderately
sweet
with
a
bit
of
toffee
bread
and
caramel
some
yeast
notes
along
with
a
bit
of
green
apple
the
flavor
is
fairly
watery
too
overall
this
is
a
decently
tasty
beer
and
one
thats
satisfyingly
refreshing
id
like
to
try
this
during
a
hot
summer
texas
day
im
not
too
impressed
but
its
just
fine
as
it
is
the
flavor
of
vivant
is
anchored
by
a
strong
showing
of
specialty
amber
malts
and
fruity
belgian
yeast
that
lend
it
flavors
of
sweet
bread
and
apple
tingles
on
the
top
of
the
tongue
with
just
enough
hop
bitterness
to
counteract
the
sweet
stuff
grain
lingers
in
the
finish
with
a
hint
of
alcohol
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
light
on
the
tongue
despite
the
mediumfull
body
overall
a
decent
beer
but
probably
not
a
repeat
purchase
for
me
o
easy
drink
has
an
enjoyable
character
to
it
with
the
unique
combination
of
flavors
favors
more
of
the
fall
side
to
its
fallwinter
seasonal
category
another
great
can
by
southern
star
o
eh
its
ok
i
enjoyed
this
in
the
mitts
of
a
number
of
pales
and
ipas
so
it
was
a
surprise
to
find
out
what
style
of
beer
that
it
was
my
wife
liked
it
if
that
means
anything
haha
o
a
very
easy
drinker
with
some
interesting
and
unexpected
flavors
overall
very
well
done
a
great
beer
for
the
colder
months
even
in
texas
as
this
is
on
the
stronger
and
maltier
side
i
really
love
that
southern
star
chose
such
a
unique
style
to
be
their
first
canned
seasonal
and
look
forward
to
their
future
releases
cheers
very
nice
beer
glad
to
have
another
good
one
out
of
the
region
this
is
a
lighter
subtle
refreshing
beer
that
is
malty
up
front
but
has
enough
fruityfloral
hop
and
yeast
notes
to
keep
things
interesting
overall
its
nice
and
pleasant
i
could
drink
this
often
its
not
overly
sweet
and
theres
a
nice
drinkability
to
it
taste
is
lots
of
caramel
malts
slightly
sweet
and
reminds
me
a
bit
of
the
bombshell
blonde
as
far
as
the
breadiness
and
creamy
body
there
is
a
toasty
aspect
that
is
different
and
the
yeast
does
not
quite
throw
off
enough
esters
to
really
shine
as
a
farmhouse
ale
more
like
a
decadent
amber
ale
with
a
touch
of
yeasty
fruit
not
bad
it
kinda
grows
on
you
after
a
couple
tries
first
can
i
had
i
was
a
bit
disappointed
this
particular
sample
is
my
5th
can
over
the
past
couple
weeks
and
now
i
am
thinking
a
couple
more
4pack
purchases
will
be
in
my
future
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
o
great
new
seasonal
from
southern
star
it
makes
me
want
to
try
other
brews
from
the
biere
de
garde
style
definitely
recommend
picking
this
one
up
to
try
the
6row
will
also
please
most
macroonly
drinkers
this
is
southern
stars
newest
seasonal
i
think
it
is
a
late
fall
early
winter
release
at
first
try
i
really
enjoyed
this
but
after
a
few
more
tries
this
does
not
hit
the
mark
good
effort
though
750
ml
caged
and
corked
bottle
served
in
a
tulip
the
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
amber
color
with
about
an
inch
light
tan
head
head
retention
is
good
and
theres
a
lot
of
lacing
aroma
is
mostly
malty
it
smells
like
dark
fruit
raisins
toffee
caramel
apples
and
some
sweet
spices
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
it
tastes
like
dark
fruit
raisins
plums
apples
caramel
bready
malt
brown
sugar
and
some
cinnamon
mouthfeelbody
is
lightmedium
its
a
bit
coating
and
has
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
i
liked
this
and
i
think
its
worth
a
try
if
you
come
across
it
this
is
one
of
the
oddest
smelltotaste
transfers
ever
feels
like
2
different
beers
the
scentappearance
had
promise
but
it
just
really
lacked
elsewhere
biere
de
garde
is
not
a
style
i
personally
associate
with
holiday
beer
in
my
head
so
this
was
a
nice
treat
and
a
rethinking
of
the
christmas
beer
paradigm
for
me
you
could
have
told
me
this
was
belgian
and
i
would
have
agreed
the
yeast
is
distinctively
so
medium
range
amber
color
with
some
soft
hazy
and
a
large
foaming
off
white
head
od
teeny
tiny
bubbles
ring
lacing
as
it
sips
smells
of
sweet
malt
subtle
herbal
spice
and
belgian
yeast
there
is
a
candy
sweetness
as
first
in
the
taste
but
it
is
replaced
quickly
by
a
sharp
spice
profile
that
isnt
immediately
attributable
to
the
usual
suspects
my
guess
is
that
a
good
amount
of
the
spiciness
comes
from
the
yeast
which
has
carbonated
this
beer
robustly
enough
to
clean
up
the
richer
sugary
malt
a
strange
thin
fruity
finish
to
this
one
caught
me
by
surprise
a
little
bit
apples
and
pears
as
it
closes
a
different
take
on
a
christmas
beer
for
sure
but
one
i
enjoyed
quite
a
lot
jd
there
are
too
man
beers
out
there
to
pick
this
one
up
again
a
nice
surprise
of
a
beer
picked
this
750ml
up
on
clearance
for
7
and
it
was
worth
every
penny
o
im
glad
i
had
this
beer
but
probablt
wouldnt
go
back
to
it
it
was
well
worth
the
try
though
my
second
la
choulette
biere
i
spotted
this
at
my
local
and
i
figured
i
would
give
it
a
try
since
i
had
hadnt
had
any
la
choulette
ambree
in
about
ten
years
this
one
pours
a
rustic
muddled
amber
brown
unsure
of
what
color
it
wants
to
be
in
my
glass
with
a
big
thicket
of
foaming
khaki
tan
head
fine
lacing
left
behind
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
this
is
definitely
a
french
style
farmhouse
ale
not
as
funky
as
belgian
saisonsbiere
de
gardes
aroma
has
tart
applesgreen
raisins
and
a
thick
layer
of
fresh
baked
breadiness
very
nice
mineral
water
tone
as
well
binds
things
together
with
light
herbal
hops
blended
in
flavor
is
complex
a
light
air
of
musky
horse
blanket
with
tart
apples
juicy
plump
raisins
or
plums
with
a
thick
slice
of
bread
with
caramelized
toasted
malts
playing
the
key
role
here
strength
is
well
hidden
i
wouldnt
have
guessed
this
had
that
much
booze
in
it
with
a
blind
taste
mouthfeel
is
a
nice
juicy
round
middle
with
a
big
dry
finish
medium
bodied
effervescent
airy
carbonation
very
nice
texture
rolling
off
the
palate
with
each
sip
overall
a
likeable
biere
albeit
a
bit
expensive
at
9
99
a
750ml
bottle
however
im
glad
i
decided
to
revisit
this
french
brewery
not
bad
at
all
this
brewery
is
a
survivor
theyve
been
doing
their
thing
the
french
farmhouse
thing
since
1885
unlike
a
lot
of
belgian
abbey
breweries
you
can
be
assured
that
this
artisanal
french
operation
is
the
real
thing
although
the
true
art
of
bière
de
garde
is
basically
as
lost
as
the
music
of
the
aztecs
you
still
have
a
chance
to
try
the
distinctiveness
of
europes
forgotten
brewing
country
buy
a
la
choulette
product
d
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
the
spices
keep
it
interesting
but
dont
overpower
the
taste
o
a
caramel
candy
sweetness
reigns
in
this
beer
i
cant
say
im
a
huge
fan
though
others
may
like
it
personally
i
wouldnt
buy
it
again
but
its
not
a
bad
beer
i
just
tend
to
prefer
drier
ones
even
though
this
is
a
christmas
beer
i
think
this
is
a
pretty
textbook
example
of
biere
de
garde
it
adheres
very
close
to
style
with
minor
christmasspice
accents
recommended
for
fans
of
the
style
good
by
itself
but
as
usual
begs
for
a
nice
food
pairing
it
would
easily
fly
with
christmas
dinners
of
all
stripes
drinkability
a
good
beer
in
the
french
style
bière
de
garde
drinkability
pretty
high
the
almost
effervescent
mouthfeel
goes
a
long
way
here
d
highly
drinkable
an
excellent
example
of
style
i
believe
this
is
also
a
very
accessible
quality
brew
bring
it
to
a
holiday
party
and
watch
the
converts
discover
the
true
joy
of
beer
how
about
dessert
this
would
be
great
for
dessert
the
smell
is
very
sweet
but
the
brew
itself
is
not
overly
sweet
it
has
that
malty
dopplebocklike
caramel
backbone
it
is
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
but
not
too
watery
750ml
bottle
on
sale
for
10
i
was
not
sure
what
to
expect
from
this
beer
but
i
was
a
little
surprised
how
much
i
enjoyed
it
it
was
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
good
head
the
smell
was
spicy
and
dusty
not
bad
the
taste
was
spices
dust
almost
like
a
dark
saison
but
also
made
me
think
of
christmas
spices
which
could
be
the
power
of
suggestion
at
work
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
good
beer
but
i
would
not
revisit
it
i
will
however
purchase
their
framboise
next
note
this
bottle
has
been
cellared
for
over
a
year
improving
also
note
that
this
review
was
done
while
the
beer
was
approx
50
degrees
f
and
the
aromasflavorsmouthfeel
change
considerably
as
the
beer
warms
a
very
enjoyable
beer
i
will
pick
up
more
of
this
next
time
i
see
it
something
i
would
recommend
drinkability
under
carbonated
fairly
monotone
and
unmemorable
poured
into
a
tulip
a
nice
golden
dark
copper
color
some
carbonation
tiny
fizzy
offwhite
head
some
islands
left
behind
the
nose
is
malty
slight
yeast
figs
raisins
plums
and
some
caramel
the
taste
is
sweet
maltyyeasty
with
some
dark
fruits
thrown
in
and
caramel
medium
body
very
drinkable
this
is
a
different
biere
de
garde
in
my
book
tasty
but
quite
not
the
same
very
easy
drinking
brew
d
nice
approachable
and
i
got
it
on
a
discount
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
fine
noel
and
a
really
good
choice
for
the
evening
sometimes
the
style
can
wear
on
me
but
i
think
this
was
done
really
well
i
would
defintly
get
this
one
again
next
year
drinkability
bottled
at
750
ml
it
shoudl
be
shared
i
would
not
suggest
drinking
more
than
a
half
bottle
easy
drinking
without
alcholic
notes
a
nice
holiday
beer
without
the
heavy
body
it
seems
to
lack
in
richness
and
depth
not
nearly
as
impressed
with
this
one
as
i
was
with
other
offerings
from
this
brewery
and
pretty
mediocre
for
both
a
biere
de
garde
and
a
christmas
ale
drinkability
a
pleasant
christmas
time
beer
that
is
enjoyed
slowly
worth
giving
this
a
try
picked
up
a
bottl
e
on
sale
as
a
whim
opens
nice
pretty
good
color
much
like
magic
hat
9
very
little
head
and
no
leg
left
on
glass
smells
sweet
and
slightly
citrus
like
taste
is
up
front
and
lingers
nicely
would
pair
nicely
with
goose
or
duck
probably
would
not
buy
again
poured
a
rich
crimson
red
color
with
an
off
white
head
that
subsided
to
a
thin
ring
of
film
around
the
edge
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
malty
almost
like
a
scotch
ale
but
much
more
estery
the
taste
is
very
smooth
and
creamy
it
begins
with
the
most
unobtrusive
malt
sweetness
that
builds
as
the
beer
rolls
over
the
tongue
the
usual
belgian
high
carbonation
levels
arent
found
in
this
one
and
it
is
a
refreshing
example
the
mouthfeel
is
very
nice
yet
i
might
revisit
this
beer
later
as
i
think
i
might
have
got
a
bottle
the
leaked
gas
through
the
cork
as
it
just
dosent
seem
carbonated
enough
very
tasty
and
drinkable
yet
a
little
flat
for
a
belgian
d
although
its
not
one
of
the
superelite
belgian
christmas
ales
it
would
be
hard
to
argue
that
this
ones
not
worth
its
cost
its
more
of
a
mainstream
ale
than
some
yet
its
still
full
enough
to
keep
you
interested
and
in
a
certain
way
its
very
much
more
drinkable
and
as
this
is
indeed
a
christmas
ale
id
be
more
than
willing
to
offer
it
to
guests
before
during
or
after
a
holiday
feast
quite
enjoyable
notes
slight
metallic
twinge
at
the
end
of
each
pull
was
a
distraction
the
taste
lays
down
on
the
palate
for
quite
some
time
and
its
a
bit
cakey
overall
id
say
this
is
a
below
average
offering
and
certainly
not
worthy
of
another
purchase
at
its
current
price
the
drinkability
on
this
was
pretty
high
although
it
can
be
a
bit
cloying
but
that
depends
how
quickly
you
want
to
drink
it
letting
mine
open
up
was
a
good
call
and
had
the
evening
provided
more
time
i
could
certainly
have
had
another
overall
this
was
an
enjoyable
experience
although
i
should
have
known
that
with
a
noel
biere
de
garde
i
was
in
for
an
unusual
treat
the
best
buy
date
is
in
2
days
although
i
assume
its
an
06
brew
bc
the
year
boxes
are
69
so
im
surprised
that
they
dont
call
for
it
to
be
aged
apparently
they
already
did
the
garding
and
found
the
sweet
spot
a
nice
pleasant
beer
but
im
not
really
thrilled
by
it
i
was
hoping
for
a
little
more
from
a
christmas
beer
i
would
drink
it
again
though
its
pretty
good
pours
a
deep
cherrywood
with
a
thin
frothy
light
tanned
head
that
doesnt
stick
around
much
before
it
becomes
a
thin
layer
of
bubbles
on
top
of
the
body
however
it
leaves
some
lacing
rings
with
each
sip
nose
starts
off
with
a
whiff
of
vanilla
cherries
chocolate
molasses
and
bread
the
background
alcohol
in
the
smell
gives
this
sort
of
a
cordial
quality
flavors
also
offer
a
very
similar
profile
with
the
vanilla
berries
dark
malty
flavors
of
bread
chocolate
and
cane
syrup
finishes
with
herbal
hops
mild
bitterness
and
a
sticky
sweetness
reminds
me
of
a
doppelbock
at
times
but
with
a
francobelgian
twist
on
it
lingering
aftertaste
reminds
me
of
those
allnatural
fruit
rollups
mouthfeel
is
rather
full
with
a
barelythere
carbonation
which
works
rather
well
with
the
flavors
i
really
enjoy
this
but
its
kind
of
a
heavy
one
to
drink
a
lot
of
this
offering
pours
a
dark
maroon
leaving
a
thin
tan
head
that
leaves
very
quickly
the
aroma
is
bready
tart
unripened
fruit
strawberries
cherries
sour
dough
bread
and
a
musty
dank
aroma
the
taste
is
tart
upfront
sour
cherries
strawberries
lemon
leaving
a
syrupy
mouthfeel
that
coats
the
palate
the
hops
are
brisk
but
not
astringent
malty
fruitness
really
finishes
this
beer
off
but
is
balanced
by
a
tart
fruitness
that
really
makes
this
beer
great
overall
this
is
a
nice
beer
i
havent
had
it
in
a
few
years
but
glad
i
went
back
to
it
for
this
christmas
drinkability
very
pleasant
but
not
particularly
distinctive
i
opened
this
winter
offering
after
cellaring
it
for
at
least
a
year
maybe
two
not
being
familiar
with
the
brewery
other
than
that
it
is
in
france
close
to
belgium
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
but
was
quite
pleased
the
beer
pours
a
medium
dark
color
slightly
cloudy
with
a
small
white
head
the
aroma
is
very
pleasant
with
some
sweet
malt
aroma
along
with
yeasty
plum
esters
flavor
is
sweet
from
both
a
nice
malt
composition
and
the
spicecandy
sugar
flavors
present
vanilla
and
raisin
come
through
strong
mouthfeel
is
smooth
with
a
very
small
amount
of
alcohol
warmth
present
but
perhaps
a
slight
bit
thin
overall
i
was
very
pleasantly
surprised
with
this
winter
beer
from
france
id
definitely
drink
it
again
though
it
would
be
interesting
to
see
if
its
as
good
without
such
a
long
conditioning
time
white
head
piles
up
fairly
well
after
a
good
pop
of
the
cork
but
fell
rather
quickly
dark
cherry
color
that
turns
to
cherry
sour
red
with
a
little
light
behind
it
strong
yeasty
smell
in
the
nose
with
some
malt
no
hop
nice
malt
base
a
bit
of
alcohol
and
overripe
cherry
raisins
strong
bite
in
the
taste
that
mellows
nicely
after
several
washings
over
the
palate
light
roast
flavor
underneath
the
malt
giving
it
a
strong
body
for
the
style
overall
very
pleasant
bit
pricey
at
8
50
but
worth
it
for
a
try
a
very
good
drinking
choulette
and
one
i
would
readily
have
again
excellent
with
dinner
palish
biere
de
garde
colour
heavenly
spicy
scent
easy
mouthfeel
understated
carbonation
and
its
in
its
prime
nine
months
before
expirey
slightly
candy
sweet
that
works
nicely
with
the
spices
sour
notes
well
under
control
biscuity
bread
quality
with
a
huge
nutty
flavor
that
makes
this
taste
like
a
brown
more
than
a
saison
highly
drinkable
as
the
7
is
completely
masked
and
quite
tasty
though
unlike
any
saison
ive
ever
had
a
very
worthwhile
beer
from
la
choulette
this
brew
was
the
hands
down
favorite
at
our
christmas
eve
beer
tasting
very
drinkable
alcohol
almost
a
nonissue
and
nothing
to
get
sick
of
great
with
roasted
poultry
skin
drinkability
very
drinkable
the
ale
is
smooth
and
balanced
neither
hops
or
malt
overwhelm
worth
a
shot
if
you
consider
it
to
be
a
brown
or
red
ale
and
not
a
saison
i
like
the
flavors
despite
the
fact
that
they
are
not
what
i
expected
next
time
im
in
the
mood
ill
spend
the
cash
on
something
closer
to
style
one
of
the
more
drinkable
saisons
ive
had
poured
out
to
chestnut
brown
color
with
a
small
foamy
head
medium
level
of
carbonation
nice
lacing
aromas
were
light
and
fresh
crushed
cashew
nuts
and
malts
with
some
caramel
and
sweet
molasses
notes
taste
was
rather
enjoyable
honey
dark
fruits
light
malts
and
some
nutmeg
spice
blended
well
mouthfeel
was
medium
to
light
bodied
and
quite
crisp
with
a
crystal
clean
finish
decent
drinkability
id
have
this
again
when
in
the
mood
for
a
saison
i
may
try
some
of
the
less
seasonal
offerings
from
brasserie
la
choulette
as
this
was
suprisingly
good
recommended
a
saison
quite
dark
and
malty
for
the
style
with
less
complexity
and
spiciness
than
others
ive
sampled
consider
this
a
biere
de
garde
categories
aside
i
find
this
to
be
a
bit
on
the
lean
side
in
both
body
and
complexity
but
it
still
has
an
interesting
and
pleasing
flavor
profile
i
prefer
la
choulettes
ambree
to
this
offering
but
it
still
serves
as
an
excellent
winter
warmer
pours
very
deep
brown
not
cloudy
though
nice
head
very
nice
lacing
smell
is
immediately
extremely
spiced
finally
a
beer
with
a
lot
of
spice
wintry
mix
of
spices
including
mint
as
well
some
sweet
notes
as
well
taste
follows
with
a
powerful
spiced
blend
and
nice
sweet
maltiness
wonderful
ill
enjoy
the
rest
of
this
bottle
but
its
not
going
to
set
the
woods
on
fire
750
ml
bottle
corked
and
bailed
best
before
end
05
on
label
drinkability
i
cant
see
saison
in
this
beer
but
overall
it
was
pretty
tasty
if
i
see
it
again
next
winter
i
may
pick
up
another
overall
a
really
intriguing
beer
one
that
if
i
could
get
it
again
i
would
the
beer
pours
from
the
75cl
green
wired
and
corked
bottle
a
clear
burnished
copper
color
with
the
head
minimal
in
size
the
texture
frothy
and
the
color
a
very
light
tan
after
its
quick
demise
the
lace
forms
a
thin
sheet
upon
the
glass
nose
has
an
over
ripe
fruit
aroma
plum
like
sweet
and
refreshing
the
start
is
sweet
with
the
malt
presence
adequate
top
is
light
to
moderate
in
feel
finish
is
strikingly
acidic
and
the
hops
delectable
in
their
spiciness
the
aftertaste
almost
vinous
dry
as
a
desert
bleached
bone
a
fine
drinking
beer
and
one
that
hits
the
b
spot
at
least
for
me
6
5
for
a
750ml
in
mi
thats
cheep
the
syrup
hues
ive
repeatedly
mentioned
are
no
so
much
indicative
of
a
fullness
of
body
as
simply
undercarbonated
and
thus
full
of
blunt
unopposed
flavors
its
not
overly
thick
just
simple
of
mind
and
unfulfilling
and
what
presents
itself
doesnt
merit
any
praise
big
pop
to
the
cork
attractive
mostly
clear
dark
chestnut
color
luminous
pale
yellow
head
is
composed
of
some
bigger
bubbles
that
break
the
head
down
in
under
40
seconds
laces
in
some
strings
and
dots
in
the
first
glass
fuller
in
the
second
aroma
is
festive
nuts
combined
with
apricots
and
darker
figs
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
the
carbonation
is
quite
soft
sweet
malts
dominate
the
flavor
profile
early
the
nutiness
from
the
smell
is
amplified
along
with
a
syrupy
almost
cherry
sense
what
gets
a
little
out
of
hand
is
a
hint
of
wood
almost
sawdust
ever
suck
on
a
tinkertoy
when
you
were
a
kid
dries
a
bit
at
the
close
slight
hop
assertion
but
continues
to
fill
out
in
the
aftertaste
a
goodlooking
beer
but
its
color
and
flavors
dont
match
a
saison
and
the
maltiness
seems
a
little
flawed
to
my
tastes
murky
rubybrown
color
with
an
offwhite
head
that
diminishes
the
aroma
is
malty
and
herbal
with
a
yeasty
kinda
corky
smell
the
flavor
is
malty
and
phenolic
with
a
cardboard
corky
taste
mediumlight
in
body
semidrying
not
what
i
was
hoping
for
id
skip
it
next
time
this
is
a
clean
brownamber
beer
has
a
spoonable
creamy
beige
head
that
leaves
a
good
lace
the
aroma
is
light
and
sweet
with
a
hint
of
fruitapple
the
flavor
starts
with
an
inviting
honey
and
molasses
character
the
finish
is
a
nice
easy
alcohol
warmth
as
it
settles
in
cellared
since
last
christmas
pours
a
clear
copper
color
with
a
large
beige
colored
head
big
malty
nose
lightly
fruity
and
yeasty
smelling
but
mostly
malt
and
some
kilned
candi
sugar
notes
initial
sip
threw
me
a
curveball
i
thought
it
might
have
a
bit
of
tartness
to
it
judging
by
the
aroma
but
there
was
none
just
sweet
malty
and
a
hint
of
green
apple
a
bit
minerally
and
a
watery
aftertaste
carbonation
is
good
pretty
good
for
a
darker
biere
de
garde
this
is
ok
for
drinkability
and
it
tastes
nice
but
nothing
urging
me
to
go
back
and
get
more
upon
reflection
the
hyper
sweet
character
that
i
have
been
sensing
may
in
fact
just
be
the
aged
character
of
this
beer
kicking
in
it
is
not
distracting
and
perhaps
adds
a
certain
something
to
this
beer
overall
brewed
from
flanders
and
hallertau
hops
as
well
as
pale
and
special
malts
it
sounds
impressive
but
drinks
like
a
runofthemill
sweet
brune
not
that
special
for
a
xmas
offering
to
be
brutal
and
certainly
not
worth
he
7
99
i
paid
for
it
not
bad
but
dont
waste
your
cash
on
this
one
not
unless
its
around
the
34
mark
for
an
outdated
75cl
750ml
bottle
pop
the
cork
a
dark
ruby
red
couloured
brew
with
a
large
head
of
whiteoffwhite
foam
aromas
are
of
sweet
belgian
malts
and
candy
sugar
as
well
as
several
kinds
of
fruits
and
hops
there
are
also
some
flanders
red
ale
notes
on
the
nose
with
some
cherrylike
aromas
and
some
funky
lambiclike
tartness
the
taste
follows
through
with
some
lovely
oud
red
flavors
of
cherries
and
some
other
sweet
malt
like
flavors
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
full
and
the
drinkability
is
excellent
nice
ruby
brown
color
and
a
big
huge
that
lasts
for
a
while
spicy
fruity
aroma
medium
bodied
fruits
and
spices
in
taste
but
also
a
metallic
tinge
it
is
warming
in
the
peppery
finish
i
liked
this
but
the
metallic
tinge
i
was
getting
was
what
i
didnt
like
i
solid
seasonal
that
i
will
put
up
again
next
year
poured
beautifully
into
my
chimay
chalice
glass

rich
thick
head
with
excellent
sweet
smells
emanating
the
look
was
also
enticing
with
a
clear
redamber
glow
the
taste
did
not
come
through
immediately
when
it
was
cold
but
become
apparent
once
it
warmed
nice
caramel
and
honey
undertones
with
a
pronounced
malt
profile
there
was
a
definite
alcohol
warmth
but
at
7abv
it
is
missing
that
winter
warmth
it
also
does
not
have
any
distinctive
winter
characteristics

it
is
too
thin
and
no
spices
to
speak
of
this
beer
is
crisp
clean
with
nice
flavors
but
fails
in
the
winter
ale
department
and
was
kind
of
pricey
at
9
50
at
berkeley
bowl
i
remember
trader
joes
used
to
carry
a
french
xmas
beer
and
it
was
good
but
it
was
like
4
bucks
this
beer
has
a
best
if
drunk
by
date
of
2004
not
the
mark
of
excellence
a
very
drinkable
seasonal
in
that
it
will
warm
you
but
not
knock
you
out
the
beer
pours
a
brilliant
and
very
very
clear
almost
wine
like
deep
blazing
orangelike
a
glowing
fire
soft
in
the
mouth
and
in
the
aroma
with
mild
chocolatesome
banana
like
fruitiness
and
creamy
malted
milk
a
nutty
toasty
flavor
prevails
on
the
tail
end
a
malt
driven
and
really
quite
refreshing
brew
that
is
easy
to
drink
and
easy
on
the
budget
as
well
this
one
came
in
at
around
six
or
seven
bucks
i
really
really
like
this
as
a
beire
de
garde
this
should
keep
well
i
only
purchased
the
one
bottle
now
i
am
hoping
i
can
lay
in
a
few
more
i
could
drink
this
anytime
while
i
wish
id
picked
up
one
of
this
artisanal
brewerys
amber
ales
instead
the
blonde
still
has
a
low
and
subtle
wildnessfunk
that
keeps
you
from
mistaking
the
beer
for
a
middling
pilsner
it
is
definitely
a
good
thirst
quencher
on
a
warm
summer
evening
but
there
are
other
refreshing
beers
available
for
a
few
dollars
less
drinkability
a
good
beer
in
the
french
style
bière
de
garde
pours
a
nice
bright
golden
amber
color
pretty
clear
but
i
can
see
a
lot
of
floaties
in
the
bottle
big
offwhite
head
good
retention
and
lacing
aroma
is
full
of
sweet
pale
grain
flavor
lots
of
fruit
pears
apples
grapes
apricots
dates
mild
herbal
grassy
hops
a
faint
medicinal
note
just
tons
of
pilsner
malt
favor
taste
is
similar
it
starts
sweet
with
that
fresh
pale
malt
flavor
but
finishes
dry
with
some
funk
and
mild
hop
bitterness
more
light
fruitiness
big
pear
note
particularly
some
musty
applegrape
skin
flavor
and
feel
feel
is
light
but
full
theres
some
prickly
carbonation
but
its
generally
quite
smooth
due
to
the
full
body
very
easy
to
drink
goes
well
with
some
soft
goat
cheese
fun
to
find
a
nice
example
of
the
style
o
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
partly
because
it
isnt
as
malty
or
earthy
compared
to
other
beers
in
the
style
it
would
pair
very
well
with
french
cuisine

a
clear
golden
color
with
a
nice
white

the
nose
starts
out
with
some
grain
and
a
bit
of
yeast
but
is
then
somewhat
overtaken
by
skunked
hops
very
unfortunate
flavor
is
similarly
skunked
but
to
an
even
greater
level
lightmedium
body
and
high
carbonation
ugh
another
victim
of
the
green
bottle
pours
a
pretty
clear
golden
color
smell
was
slightly
floral
sweet
kind
of
like
champagne
taste
was
close
to
a
saison
but
not
as
grainy
had
a
little
bit
of
a
fruity
backend
and
a
mildly
sweet
beginning
bubbly
feel
was
nice
overall
a
good
pretty
affordable
biere
de
garde
but
i
wouldnt
say
its
definitive
for
the
style
while
its
easy
to
read
too
much
of
the
saison
style
into
this
beer
its
fuller
impressions
and
maltforward
demeanor
gives
this
beer
a
juicy
malt
profile
and
refined
mellow
taste
this
beer
is
a
very
rewarding
and
round
version
of
the
style
o
nice
to
see
a
750
under
10
and
this
biere
de
garde
is
quite
good
complex
not
as
good
as
jenlain
ambree
but
few
are
good
stuff
it
really
is
a
nice
beer
this
is
just
lacking
a
slight
bit
to
make
it
really
good
still
a
very
enjoyable
biere
de
garde
with
some
nice
dryness
on
the
end
oda
pleasant
albeit
unmemorable
beer
from
a
foreign
land
for
3
at
a
discount
i
am
happy
to
have
tried
it
nothing
crazy
but
tastes
alright
whether
labeled
a
saison
or
a
bière
de
garde
the
fact
remains
that
this
is
as
the
late
michael
jackson
wrote
where
france
meets
belgium
while
it
needs
some
improvements
no
green
glass
please
theres
no
sense
offering
this
beer
in
anything
less
than
the
750ml
bottle
it
is
the
ideal
thing
to
share
amongst
friends
or
guests
especially
where
things
like
cheese
or
crackers
are
served
and
is
a
delightful
accompaniment
to
a
relaxing
weekend
afternoon
o
to
me
drinks
like
a
tasty
saisonvery
easy
to
drink
the
whole
bottle
on
a
warm
summer
day
like
today
do
the
drinkability
was
very
good
with
a
good
balance
a
nice
easy
drinking
and
refreshing
brew
the
beer
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
big
white
rocky
cap
of
foam
a
nice
mixture
in
the
aroma
of
orchard
fruit
earth
and
yeastalmost
a
little
nutty
light
on
the
palate
pale
malt
fresh
crisp
fruit
on
the
palate
it
finishes
with
some
earth
tones
a
solid
fresh
beer
bottle
poured
a
hazy
light
yellow
color
ale
with
a
super
large
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
good
lacing
aroma
of
light
funky
notes
with
solid
medium
sweet
malt
backbone
taste
is
also
sweeter
then
i
would
have
expected
with
good
notes
of
light
barnyard
yeast
body
is
quite
full
with
great
bottle
conditioning
and
great
carbonation
with
no
apparent
alcohol
well
brewed
thought
maybe
a
tad
too
sweet
for
my
taste
hazy
yellowish
copper
in
color
thick
white
foamy
head
with
lively
carbonation
aroma
is
spicy
and
fruity
plenty
of
yeast
character
here
but
with
sweet
estery
character
the
flavor
doesnt
pop
quite
so
much
but
it
is
nice
and
malty
with
again
a
nice
hint
of
fruitiness
pretty
good
mouthfeel
low
to
medium
body
but
quite
dry
tasting
pretty
smooth
drinking
overall
pours
a
blonde
color
with
a
great
head
and
some
lace
the
aroma
is
a
touch
funky
but
that
fades
in
seconds
there
is
some
honey
and
mild
breadiness
with
a
graininess
and
some
subtle
floral
notes
as
it
warms
alfalfa
is
a
pretty
strong
character
of
the
aroma
as
well
the
flavor
is
dry
and
spicy
with
some
earthiness
and
grassiness
with
bits
of
fruitiness
and
mild
hoppiness
sneak
in
its
got
that
baguette
and
honey
sweet
maltiness
that
i
love
in
biere
de
garde
but
that
character
seems
fairly
intensified
in
this
one
the
beer
of
the
without
pants
nice
lemony
color
very
much
like
a
good
saison
with
a
fluffy
puffy
head
a
subdued
amount
of
clover
and
other
flowery
fragrances
hovers
over
the
glass
theres
a
bit
of
clove
and
some
pepper
whatever
it
is
its
absolutely
inviting
an
equally
flowery
yet
subdued
flavor
somewhat
malty
but
not
overly
so
with
a
rounded
swipe
of
pilsneresque
hops
at
the
very
end
theres
a
bit
of
breadiness
and
grass
in
the
glass
as
well
for
a
7
beer
this
does
not
overpower
or
cause
undue
wobble
nor
does
it
warm
as
it
slithers
its
way
down
the
gut
its
refreshing
and
delightful
and
i
want
another
drinkable
to
a
point
but
the
slightly
high
abv
and
big
bottle
will
catch
up
fast
if
youre
drinking
alone
d
easy
to
drink
though
after
finishing
my
glass
i
was
ready
for
something
a
bit
more
interesting
d
two
thumbs
up
more
than
drinkable
any
time
of
year
and
food
friendly
im
sure
light
aroma
of
fruit
and
malt
sharp
grainy
grass
and
pepper
cuts
in
during
the
finish
tasty
and
very
enjoyable

spot
on
for
a
bière

i
really
enjoy
a
biere
de
garde
with
a
meal
or
by
itselfa
vastly
underrated
style
in
my
humble
opinion
this
poured
into
an
oversized
wine
glass
a
rich
full
golden
with
just
a
hint
of
orange
huea
clingy
near
creamylike
white
head
atop
aromas
of
wet
grain
and
some
mineraland
slightly
sweet
dough
flavors
have
a
big
pilsner
malt
bready
quality
that
alot
of
the
style
dosome
semi
sweet
toffee
and
light
white
pepper
spice
round
out
the
finish
i
like
ita
beer
to
savor
and
enjoyvery
nice
the
body
is
medium
bordering
on
full
with
relaxed
carbonation
a
thick
not
as
thick
as
belzebuth
mouth
feel
and
a
great
satisfying
finish
overall
this
is
a
great
example
of
the
style
in
every
department
i
found
it
to
be
very
enjoyable
but
subtle
in
the
complexities
good
stuff
and
definitely
recommend
for
fans
of
the
style
still
some
sweet
cloying
characters
and
phenols
that
cut
down
on
drinkability
for
me
drinkability
is
pretty
good
nice
taste
and
goes
down
easily
and
not
a
bad
price
either
iirc
still
its
on
the
thicker
more
fullflavored
side
and
started
out
rather
rough
but
was
so
pleasant
by
the
end
i
cant
think
of
another
beer
that
turned
around
so
dramatically
as
i
acclimated
nevertheless
i
should
try
one
fresh
these
pale
bdgs
can
be
good
with
food
if
theyre
not
too
sweet
and
sharp
d
interesting
i
need
to
explore
this
style
further
this
is
my
second
example
of
the
style
and
it
was
very
different
from
the
first
pours
bright
pilsner
like
light
amber
with
some
sunshine
touches
nice
had
at
first
the
recedes
to
champagne
film
and
ok
lacing
the
aroma
is
lots
of
green
apple
peels
very
herbal
scents
some
honey
becomes
prevalent
as
the
beer
warms
though
the
taste
is
a
little
cidery
lots
of
apples
and
herbs
dry
pie
baking
herbs
at
least
thats
the
first
thing
that
comes
to
mind
this
beers
starts
to
get
a
bit
metallic
as
it
warms
though
i
liked
the
apple
flavors
but
the
warmer
it
gets
the
more
the
apples
fade
the
palate
is
fantly
fruity
with
some
dried
fruit
and
a
metallic
finish
palate
is
extremely
creamy
body
soft
ripe
fruit
cheese
tart
apples
light
hops
and
again
just
very
creamy
smooth
pours
a
clear
straw
yellow
light
bit
of
haze
thin
white
head
forms
drops
to
a
thin
ring
not
much
lacing
smell
is

sweet

sugary
dry
toast
middle
strawberries
quite

take
but

bran
vanillabrown
sugar
toast
quite
malty
some
spice
honey
nice
finish
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
goes
down
smooth
the
graininess
is
pretty
neat
because
its
so
complex
thanks
jan
creamy
smooth
mouthfeel
with
a
lingering
sweet
aftertaste
overall
a
really
nice
and
interesting
brew
and
one
of
the
few
ive
had
forom
france
to
date
drinkability
is
good
good
balance
great
fruit
i
really
liked
this
one
d
an
easily
drinkable
and
quite
complex
example
of
the
style
the
aroma
characteristics
are
especially
nice
d
this
is
one
of
those
weird
and
complex
beers
that
shock
and
offend
you
at
first
but
then
it
starts
to
grow
on
you
my
first
flanders
red
roggenbier
and
rauchbier
struck
me
the
same
way
overall
i
wouldnt
really
want
to
drink
this
all
night
especially
at
the
price
i
paid
for
this
one
but
its
totally
worth
a
try
since
it
is
so
different
and
complex
this
beer
is
like
modern
art
i
respect
it
for
the
talent
that
went
into
it
but
i
dont
really
understand
it
overall
the
lack
of
the
high
belgian
style
carbonation
makes
this
beer
a
little
flabby
maybe
ill
buy
another
bottle
in
a
year
or
so
to
see
if
their
techniques
have
improved
but
otherwise
an
enjoyable
brew
this
is
a
beer
that
insinuates
itself
on
your
tastes
it
certainly
has
plenty
of
pop
from
the
cork
and
it
pours
a
pale
yellow
with
a
nice
white
head
some
retention
a
loads
of
white
lacing
it
almost
looks
like
sugar
particles
clinging
to
the
sides
fo
the
glass
the
smell
is
green
apple
citrus
maybe
some
honey
aromas
and
other
faint
smells
of
floral
leaves
the
smell
is
second
to
the
taste
which
is
quite
good
there
is
quite
a
complexity
to
this
beer
there
are
perfumed
scents
tart
apples
citrus
floral
spices
such
as
lavender
and
grassy
notes
as
well
this
is
a
very
refreshing
pleasing
relatively
light
beer
well
worth
seeking
out
there
is
a
moderate
degree
of
carbonation
the
finish
is
somewhat
tart
and
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
refreshing
the
aftertaste
is
quite
mild
for
a
beer
with
a
7
abv
the
warming
alcohol
throatiness
does
pop
through
as
the
beer
warms
and
settles
but
the
abv
is
well
hidden
behind
a
melange
of
complexity
lchaim
the
beer
without

perfect
score
on
quality
naming
im
not
so
expert
on
biere

this
review
should
get

dose
of

the
appearance
was

of

the

the
flavor

sweet
and
a

worty

do

that

i

this

what

ill
pick
up
another

and
keep
it
for
a
special
occasion
not
bad
but
not
worthy
of
all
the
hype
as
another
reviewer
noted
a
french
masterpiece
the
beer
pours
a
brilliant
golden
with
awesome
purity
and
clarity
of
color
i
cant
help
get
the
image
of
a
beautiful
french
blonde
out

i
ruminate
over
this
fine
specimenlovely
creamy
white
head
and
sticky
lace
that
clings
to
the
side

this
beer
screams
out
of

i
could
smell
the
warming
malty
richness
even
as
it
was
being
poured
the
beer
exhibits
as
well
an
earthiness
that
some
may
call
barnyardy
yet
the
french
may
call
terroir
though
the
aromas
may
be
that
which
i
have
smelled
inside
a
french
barnsome
weathered
wood
aromas
come
to
mindi
personally
dont
find
the
smell
of
a
french
barn
to
be
negative
in
fact
it
is
this
very
rusticity
that
i
love
about
not
only
french
beer
but
the
wines
as
well
to
each
his
own
the
mouthfell
on
this
beer
is
that
of
butter
creamy
and
rich
this
beer
melts
on
the
palate
the
carbonation
is
very
fine
and
acts
as
yet
another
catalyst
in
the
creation
of
this
voluptuous
french
blonde
once
past
the
awe
of
this
beers
silken
texture
the
flavors
kick
in
rich
maltiness
adds
a
robust
quality
to
the
beer
and
a
pretty
sweetness
a
very
slight
yet
ever
present
bitterness
keeps
things
in
check
balance
wise
still
more
butter
on
the
palate
in
the
way
of
perhaps
butterscotch
warming
alcohol
comes
off
more
soothing
than
hot
and
is
integral
to
the
beers
character
a
beer
youll
love
to
curl
up
with
and
enjoy
very
very
very
slowlythis
is
one
tasty
french
blonde
sante
this
beer
totally
and
utterly
agreed
with
with
me
very
nice
floral
subtly
oaky
aroma
very
nice
tastewise
very
subtle
and
elegant
with
a
tremendously
satisfying
bitter
finish
very
savoury
a
very
juicy
little
brew
grapelike
as
venom
says
totally
awesome
we
get
the
choulette
ambree
down
under
but
not
this
im
sure
the
importers
could
get
this
if
they
wanted
to
ill
just
have
to
wait
till
i
get
to
europe
to
try
it
again
until
they
do

subtle
phenols
emerge
mid
palate
accompanied
by
light
pearish
esters
only
to
be
superceded
by
a
firm
but
judicious
light
caramel
malt
presence
that
serves
to
both
extend
malt
sweetness
and
counteract
the
high
apparant
attenuation
by
contributing
dextrins
agreeably
smooth
innocuous
and
soft
in

non

well

offsets
residual

well
and
provides
a
cleansing

mostly
clean
with
notes
of
sweet
cracker
and
hints
of
lightly
citric
lemongrass
san
culottes
is
a
dangerously
delightful
and
soft
brew
its
as
light
on
the
palate
as
a
fine
helles
but
adds
the
subtle
spice
and
fruit
of
a
belgian
pale
a
nearly
quintessential
biere
de
garde
thats
only
a
hair
shy
in
malt
character
very
enjoyable
hazy
looking
straw
color
a
dense
offwhite
head
recedes
to
a
collar
and
a
few
islands
the
aroma
is
musty
and
fruity
with
a
spattering
of
grapes
the
fruitiness
on
the
nose
is
very
muted
on
the
tongue
instead
there
is
substantial
must
a
little
leather
tinges
of
alcohol
and
some
evidence
of
lime
juice
this
is
a
unique
beverage
some
very
slight
sourness
and
tartness
a
little
bit
of
a
dry
finish
body
is
light
to
medium
and
mouthfeel
is
effervescent
nice
little
farmhouse
ale
very
drinkable
this
beer
just
tastes
off
not
pleasant
out
of
5
bier
de
gardes
tasted
oin
the
same
night
this
was
the
worst
and
had
the
lamest
malt
profile
upcharging
and
pretty
clear
deep
yellow
color
hazy
and
sparkly
head
sharp
and
winey
aroma
with
a
sense
of
yeasty
and
woodsy
mustiness
flavor
is
full
but
not
piquant
more
like
elements
of
malty
sweetness
and
oak
barrel
flavor
with
some
unfermented
grape
reasonably
fullbodied
nice
in
the
swallow
with
aftertaste
of
muskiness
enough
hops
to
make
it
balanced
for
style
i
guess
this
style
is
pretty
new
to
me
pretty
enjoyable
overall
drinkability
a
very
nice
beer
on
a
hot
day
went
great
with
indian
food
aloo
choley
very
drinkable
i
could
easily
have
helped
the
mrs
polish
off
another
bottle
and
now
wish
i
had
another
bottle
everything
combined
makes
this
a
great
beer
but
i
think
it
helps
to
have
a
bit
of
a
sweet
tooth
with
this
beer
o
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
especially
given
its
lighter
body
it
isnt
quite
interesting
enough
to
drink
on
its
own
but
i
would
definitely
consider
pairing
this
with
food
looked
good
in
the
bottle
looked
good
in
the
glass
smelled
promising
good
up
until
i
actually
sipped
it
what
a
let
down
this
one
is
a
miss
average
at
best
o
i
liked
this
a
lot
it
is
highly
drinkable
and
quite
refreshing
what
i
liked
most
is
that
it
feels
incredibly
delicate
on
your
mouth
drinkability
final
thoughts
a
very
drinkable
beer
which
showcases
well
if
not
extraordinarily
the
basic
elements
of
frenchstyle
bière
de
garde
there
is
enough
complexity
to
the
flavor
and
mouthfeel
to
warrant
a
thoughtul
sipping
but
it
is
also
fresh
and
simple
enough
to
drink
more
quickly
along
with
or
after
a
meal
at
just
over
5
for
the
750
id
have
no
reservations
buying
one
again
id
like
to
come
across
a
fresher
bottle
and
also
perhaps
store
a
couple
for
another
year
or
two
to
see
how
they
develop
alcohol
is
hidden
but
this
reminds
me
too
much
of
corn
pizza
meh
i
liked
the
sweet
aftertaste
and
its
sour
start
it
just
failed
in
the
body
fullness
for
me
but
overall
ok
a
different
take
of
a
biere
de
garde
and
one
i
likely
will
not
revisit
drinkability
is
pretty
good
its
pretty
light
and
smooth
altough
the
flavor
of
the
esters
isnt
my
favorite
im
just
not
a
huge
fan
of
those
orange
dominant
french
yeasts
a
la
jenlain
or
thiriez
still
it
has
garded
remarkably
well
and
softened
some
of
it
warmed
an
my
pallate
adjusted
making
it
a
pretty
nice
little
desert
beer
without
the
usual
strong
sweetness
by
the
end
i
really
warmed
up
to
it
also
like
jenlain
la
choulette
bieres
are
a
bargain
price
compared
to
many
of
their
counterparts
la
choulette
blonde
is
a
very
strange
biere
de
garde
ive
never
had
a
beer
with
so
many
cider
qualities
as
a
matter
of
fact
if
i
was
blindfolded
i
would
think
this
was
a
cider
its
decent
enough
to
drink
but
just
doesnt
follow
along
the
lines
of
what
i
want
in
this
fairly
open
style
of
beer
an
interesting
brew
in
its
own
way
something
sharp
about
it
makes
it
a
slow
sipper
my
first
bier
de
garde
was
jolly
pumpkins
golden
ale
it
was
full
of
sour
wonderfulness
and
i
wanted
more
i
tried
la
choulette
and
i
didnt
get
that
same
sourness
dont
get
me
wrong
this
is
a
good
beer
indeed
it
had
a
bit
of
funk
to
it
was
it
too
old
can
someone
reccomend
something
delicicous
with
some
good
sourness
caged
and
corked
best
before
dating
on
front
label
but
if
i
can
figure
it
out
it
looks
like
this
is
2
years
past
its
due
date
any
way
it
seems
to
be
fresh
and
in
good
shape
so
i
will
continue
pours
light
golden
and
clear
minor
off
white
head
and
pretty
standard
lacing
powdered
sugar
nose
then
notes
of
ripe
fruit
pepper
white
wine
earthy
and
then
a
fairly
sour
finish
complex
refreshing
and
generally
interesting
stuff
went
well
with
the
spicy
jambalaya
we
had
for
supper
worth
a
try
drinkability
a
very
good
beer
in
the
french
style
bière
de
garde
drinkability
although
this
bottle
is
best
before
1205
i
think
it
has
benefited
from
the
age
as
i
wasnt
prepared
to
like
it
as
much
as
i
have
given
the
other
reviews
the
oxidation
has
brought
out
some
very
interesting
flavors
very
lightly
puckering
yeast
and
citric
combination
smooth
medium
body
pepper
in
the
finish
a
little
thin
but
the
alcohol
is
nonetheless
well
hidden
at
7
5
good
for
an
anymeal
sipper
and
cuisine
de
biere
the
aroma
unpacks
some
great
malt
scents
along
with
some
citrus
and
some
luscious
floral
and
fruit
charateristics
and
a
touch
of
cinnamon
and
minty
hop
the
flavors
drive
home
everything
asserted
by
the
nose
the
european
malts
form
the
base
and
support
some
slight
fruity
element
noticeable
but
tasteful
bitterness
its
not
a
dynamic
brew
and
despite
the
decent
carbonation
is
a
little
on
the
thick
side
especially
as
i
appreciate
the
style
nice
white
foam
upon
a
golden
and
quiet
clear
beer
nose
is
sicy
and
has
insense
note
to
it
quiet
some
sweet
applejuice
and
hint
of
sourness
complete
the
complex
nose
taste
is
strong
alcoholic
aplejuice
and
hint
of
gember
with
moderate
low
bitterness
quiet
drinkable
and
enjoyable
brew
imo
bottle
from
the
blue
max
in
bloomington
mn
finely
hazed
pale
gold
appearance
with
a
bright
white
head
of
about
12
an
inch
in
height
fairly
simple
ring
lacing
tart
lemony
aroma
suggestions
of
definite
damp
wood
and
muskiness
medium
mouthfeel
high
carbonation
fairly
wellbalanced
approach
some
yeastiness
dried
straw
and
medium
citrus
astringency
just
held
back
by
a
countering
malt
sweetness
thats
a
little
nondescript
except
for
a
very
bare
caramelization
and
baked
apple
the
finish
has
a
hardtopindown
fade
to
it
reminds
me
a
little
of
soda
water
with
a
squeeze
of
bottled
lemon
concentrate
not
bad
nice
aroma
not
that
distinctive
i
didnt
have
all
that
high
of
expectations
of
this
beer
just
from
looking
at
other
reviews
but
i
really
ejoyed
this
offering
poured
into
a
oversized
wine
glass
a
dull
medium
gold
with
a
well
formed
white
head
that
left
sheets
of
lace
behindvery
interesting
and
complex
aromas
i
picked
up
some
spiced
green
apple
like
notes
brown
sugar
and
even
a
hint
of
wood
thrown
in
again
very
pleasantly
suprised
by
the
flavors
and
even
more
so
the
complexity
of
this
country
ale
a
real
spiced
flavor
like
clove
and
cinnamon
not
strong
but
to
be
its
the
backbone
of
this
beer
some
green
apple
light
tartness
and
brown
sugar
sweetness
rounds
out
this
very
nicely
a
little
filling
but
thuroghly
enjoyable
and
i
would
bet
extremely
food
friendlyit
ages
extremely
well
mine
was
best
enjoyed
by
1205
iam
diggin
the
french
country
ales
and
will
continue
to
seek
them
out
750
ml
corked
and
caged
bottle
pours
a
cloudy
orange
amber
color
with
a
fluffy
white
head
that
leaves
some
lacing
in
my
glass
musty
funky
grape
aromas
funky
fruity
and
spicy
pepper
flavors
i
think
i
taste
horseradish
medium
bodied
with
a
nice
crisp
mouthfeel
kind
of
wine
like
very
dry
a
fair
offering
though
i
prefer
sans
culottes
pours
out
to
a
warm
golden
yellow
hue
that
is
slightly
hazed
small
head
of
white
foam
calms
to
a
thin
layer
of
bubbles
over
the
head
of
the
beer
lots
of
lace
medium
level
of
carbonation
aroma
smells
like
buttered
popcorn
and
malt
with
a
touch
fo
meaty
grain
notes
nice
taste
fair
buttery
malt
sweet
grains
earthy
hues
some
flowery
notes
and
notions
of
yeast
strains
swirl
about
better
when
warmed
to
about
50
degrees
or
so
mouthfeel
was
fine
slightly
smooth
and
bubbly
drinkability
is
average
not
bad
worth
trying
i
just
recommend
that
you
have
it
at
a
warmer
temp
than
most
beers
as
far
as
drinkability
goes
this
was
a
huge
disappointment
in
fact
i
dumped
the
last
third
of
my
glass
far
too
honeysweet
and
lacking
the
breadth
of
character
to
be
anything
better
than
mediocre
boring
and
lackluster
i
feel
seriously
ripped
off
having
paid
as
much
as
i
did
avoid
i
know
i
will
from
now
on
750ml
bottle
with
dec
05
date
on
it
body
appears
a
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
rapid
forming
tall
foamy
white
head
pretty
interesting
aroma
with
some
light
farmy
notes
and
sweet
fruits
such
as
pears
also
notes
of
grain
were
mixed
in
taste
starts
with
some
fruit
before
the
farmy
yeast
notes
come
through
some
spiciness
peaks
in
over
earthy
notes
some
interesting
wine
like
flavors
seemed
to
mix
in
at
times
finishes
up
with
a
spicy
sweet
flavor
interesting
enough
overall
to
keep
you
sipping
good
carbonation
and
crisp
feel
to
it
easy
enough
drinking
but
i
doubt
i
would
have
more
after
the
750
solid
brew
hazy
light
orange
with
a
head
plump
in
size
and
eloquent
in
its
lacing
and
texture
aroma
is
fairly
well
balanced
between
the
malt
caramel
bread
hops
herbs
and
yeast
barnyard
funk
along
with
a
touch
of
honey
hay
pear
skins
and
peach
in
the
flavor
the
first
that
strikes
me
is
its
resemblence
to
affligem
triple
in
its
sweet
malt
and
yeast
contribution
its
a
bit
sweet
overall
but
it
does
have
a
unique
rustic
character
that
i
enjoy
notes
of
honey
light
fruits
and
sugar
covered
rock
candy
pineapple
flavored
a
pretty
good
beer
that
i
definately
enjoyed
first
impression
was
of
a
lager
then
quickly
it
moves
into
a
smooth
and
creamy
apple
juicelike
flavor
on
the
swallow
decently
complex
not
overly
so
a
nice
sweetness
on
the
backend
makes
this
quite
enjoyable
i
wouldnt
rank
it
a
top
saison
not
really
even
close
but
easily
a
very
drinkable
beer
all
in
all
la
choulette
blond
is
an
interesting
and
enjoyable
beer
which
has
a
lot
going
on
in
its
750ml
bottle
format
i
would
recommend
it
to
share
with
a
few
friends
as
its
acidity
and
relatively
high
alcohol
content
limits
its
solodrinkability
factor
poured
a
deep
amber
to
a
delicate
white
head
with
a
slight
cloudyness
smell
almost
resembles
tamarind
spicy
and
fragrant
quite
a
bouquet
tastes
just
as
it
smells
spicy
with
an
aftertaste
that
resembles
tamarind
very
complex
with
no
offensive
undertones
very
little
carbonation
and
an
aromatic
finish
make
this
a
very
nice
christmas
beer
a
gorgeous
biere
de
garde
with
a
multitude
of
aroma
and
a
variety
of
flavors
in
each
bottle
fascinating
to
age
and
a
supreme
value
for
the
price
conscious
huge
thank
you
to
the
three
gentlemen
who
introduced
me
to
this
beauty
i
only
thought
the
ambree
existed
the
taste
is
very
nice
definetly
a
malt
expierience
bread
like
plum
and
a
warming
alcohol
presence
im
trying
to
figure
out
how
they
stuff
so
much
beer
into
this
little
bottle
first
impression
is
fluffyness
and
malt
caramel
malt
caramel
coated
oat
rings
on
a
bed
of
beet
greens
there
is
an
odd
distracting
seemingly
industrial
mix
of
bitter
saccharine
that
wants
you
to
ignore
the
rural
reduction
that
flows
so
easily
free
yourself
and
embrace
it
d
dangerously
drinkable
cork
pops
out
gently
after
chilling
bottle
for
several
weeks
pours
clear
golden
head
develops
that
overflows
the
glass
aroma
is
sour
with
some
grassy
and
musty
earthy
odors
first
sip
reveals
some
straw
flavor
with
a
little
sourness
a
small
hint
of
bitterness
but
very
subtle
mouthfeel
is
thin
a
bit
heavier
taste
than
other
biere
de
gardes
i
tried
musty
flavors
with
some
earthiness
a
lot
of
flavors
going
on
here
they
dont
all
blend
together
especially
well
refreshing
on
the
palate
and
fairly
drinkable
here
on
this
site
its
designated
a
saison
though
the
label
says
biere
de
garde
artisanale
call
it
what
you
want
seems
too
syrupy
and
flowery
to
call
it
a
saison
whatever
it
is
its
pretty
tasty
although
the
too
apparent
alcohol
diminishes
my
enjoyment

sweetness
i
enjoyed
it
however
the
hot
weather
combined
with
the
sticky
sweetness
just
made
me
crave
a
light
wheat
beer
decent
nonetheless
drinkability
the
price
is
right
on
this
one
its
light
but
i
think
that
i
would
tire
of
its
relatively
uneventful
taste
after
another
glass
rich
gold
in
colour
with
a
fair
bit
of
carbonation
great
aromas
of
toasted
malt
and
soft
fruit
peaches
perhaps
flavor
wise
it
has
a
nice
malty
sweetness
along
with
additional
notes
of
citrus
fruit
and
spices
its
quite
heavy
in
the
mouth
with
a
warming
finish
a
little
too
much
alcohol
flavor
in
this
one
for
me
but
its
still
pretty
good
stuff
its

does
not
seem
to
contain
any
spices
as
i
would
have
expected
taste
is
quite
refreshing
with
some
nice
floral
malt
and
lingering
bitterness
at
the
end
body
is
a
bit
thin
for
a
biere

and
this
generally
lack
some
punch
to
be
truly
remarkable
might
work
as
an
after
dinner
quaff
for
its
ability
to
warm
you
up
and
settle
you
down

still
just
not
right
somehow

the

doughy
and

pretty
nice
the
flavor
is
quite
earthy
and
elemental
some
fruity

like
qualities
surrface
soon
enough
a
bit
of
lemon
is
detected
and
unrefined
hop
notes
as
well
maybe
a
little
mettalic
character
too
lively
mouthfeel
with
a
body
checking
in
around
medium
better
than
average
but
ive
had
better
biere

leaving
the
large
amount
of
chunky
yeast
at
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
this
one
pours
a
mostly
clear
orangishgold
with
a
thin
and
tightlyknit
white
head
the
aroma
is
malty
sweet
with
a
hefty
dose
of
fruit
most
notably
peaches
theres
a
bit
of
spiciness
along
with
a
slight
medicinal
phenolic
note
some
barnyard
yeast
as
well
the
flavor
starts
out
quite
sweet
before
a
peppery
spiciness
takes
hold
and
attempts
but
fails
to
keep
the
honeylike
sweetness
in
check
like
in
the
aroma
theres
some
barnyard
yeast
and
musty
farmhouse
character
but
it
really
gets
mauled
by
the
nearcloying
sweetness
more
medicinal
phenolics
fairly
thin
on
the
palate
with
a
slighty
dry
finish
that
has
a
touch
of
alcohol
both
in
mouthfeel
and
flavor
i
also
detect
a
hint
of
a
white
grape
peel
flavor
and
astringency
in
the
aftertaste
despite
the
four
or
five
main
flavor
components
this
brew
comes
as
across
as
thin
lacking
in
complexity
and
overly
sweet
quite
the
lackluster
example
of
the
bière
de
garde
style
blonde
in
colour
with
initially
big
pillowy
head
which
fades
quite
quickly
mine
had
heaps
of
sediment
floating
around
in
it
kind
of
sticky
malt
flavour
and
not
overly
flavourfull
slight
floral
bitter
finish
but
as
i
said
a
bit
too
sticky
othis
is
a
good
but
not
memorable
beer
the
flavor
profile
is
pretty
solid
for
the
style
with
nice
toasted
malts
and
the
alcohol
is
very
wellintegrated
into
the
beer
it
is
also
pretty
goodlooking
and
true
to
style
in
that
regard
the
smell
and
feel
are
a
bit
lacking
and
i
could
have
used
a
bit
more
hops
or
sharpness
to
balance
the
sweet
malt
profile
but
these
are
not
major
criticisms
o
this
beer
is
a
lot
maltier
and
heaver
in
body
compared
to
other
beers
in
the
style
sort
of
like
a
comparison
between
a
bock
and
a
doppelbock
but
its
light
enough
to
be
rather
drinkable
especially
since
any
traces
of
alcohol
are
very
well
hidden
poured
a
reddish
brown
with
large
voluminous
head
that
gives
off
massive

the
malts
are
strong

i
pick
up
good
amounts
of
caramel

theres

thanks
to

base
and
good
carbonation
finishes
easy
with
a
nice
crisp
bite
to
it
and
a

sweet
and
i
swear
theres
a
minor
winelike
fruitiness

the

with

much
better
then
expected
and
a
nice
example
of
how
good
the
french
bière

can
be
i
have
a
suspicion
my
bottle
was
off
look
forward
to
retrying
at
a
future
date
if
i
come
across
this
again
i
should
point
out
that
i
opened
this
one
around
55
f
and
that
further
chilling
would
have
reduced
and
possible
prevented
the
foaming
overall
really
nice
not
what
i
was
expecting
biere

was
more
of
a

in
my
head
but
still

than
expected
slightly
spicy

the

try
a

bière

and
i
tend
to
not
really
enjoy
the
style
that
being
said
this
brew
seems
a
little
closer
to
a
belgian
strong
dark
in
style
and
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
as
such
my
rating
reflects
the
beer
itself
and
not
its
attributes
relative
to
the
style
not
too
thin
decently
smooth
but
slightly
watery
lively

not
enough
to
completely

a

poured
from
a

the
beer
is

brown
with
a
fluffy

the

the

it
is

the

is
medium

with

the
beer
is
smooth
and
easily
drinkable
this
is
my
first
biere

so
i
do
not
have
any
thing
to
compare
it
to
but
i
do
like
this

darkish
copper
not
much
light
coming

dissipated
leaves
a
very

ring
and
slight

a

some

to
make
it

it

this
one
didnt
work
for
me
as
well
as
some
other
biere
de

ive
had
as
this
was
more
of
a
marmalade
and
caramel
effect
than
what
i
expected
bottle
notes
its
from
42507
d
this
will
make
a
good
pair
with
some
goat
cheese
and
honey
goes
down
with
ease
despite
the
8
abv
the
french
beer
scene
is
a
lot
better
than
most
poeple
realise
this
is
a
good
example
of
what
they
are
missing
pours
a
deep
amber
color
bordering
on
brown
with
some
bright
highlights
the
smallish
head
leaves
a
bit
of
lace
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
low
on
esters
and
skews
toward
the
malt
side
with
plenty
of
bready
almost
german
malts
and
a
dusty
tobacco
note
on
the
palate
big
carbonation
and
smooth
sweet
maltiness
alongside
some
dextrins
theres
a
bit
of
orangey
fruitiness
evident
on
the
edges
good
acidity
toward
the
end
the
finish
is
long
and
a
tad
sweet
while
the
mouthfeel
is
full
and
malty
overall
with
a
bit
of
hop
acids
at
the
end
and
plenty
of
soft
carbonation
throughout
overall
this
is
a
tasty
biere
de
garde
skewed
toward
the
malty
side
without
much
of
the
herbalearthy
notes
often
found
in
beers
of
the
style
still
its
a
richyetlight
interesting
beer
that
would
probably
be
great
with
food
and
cheese
so
still
a
definite
thumbs
up
overall
my
first
bière
de
garde
i
like
it
but
i
wish
it
didnt
have
so
much
abv
not
a
bad
beer
in
that
it
pours
a
orangish
amber
fairly
clear
i
didnt
get
any
yeasty
bits
floating
about
as
mentioned
in
other
reviews
and
only
moderately
carbonated
the
beer
has
a
smallish
head
that
does
retain
and
does
lace
to
a
degree
the
smell
is
quite
musty
full
of
caramel
malts
perhaps
some
cherry
yeasty
alcohol
aromas
some
tartness
in
the
smell
too
the
smell
is
not
overly
enticing
but
keep
going
because
the
taste
is
better
what
youll
find
is
a
very
caramelized
malty
tart
sourish
cherryish
ale
that
is
quite
sippable
and
refreshing
the
caramel
comes
out
the
gate
quite
strong
but
near
the
finish
some
of
the
other
complex
flavors
emerge
some
tart
apples
some
cherry
notes
a
yeasty
tang
some
sweet
malts
some
sourish
hops
the
beer
is
not
overly
carbonated
quite
light
bodied
for
its
8
abv
and
quite
soft
on
the
tongue
there
is
nothing
here
that
will
offend
right
out
of
the
bottle
the
caramel
was
a
bit
much
and
i
thought
it
was
too
much
like
a
strong
marzen
but
then
the
beers
other
qualities
emerged
not
a
bad
beer
worth
scouting
out
very
good
sipping
beer
on
a
cold
winters
evening
lchaim
d
this
one
is
a
bit
too
sweet
for
my
liking
but
i
think
it
does
a
pretty
good
job
of
fitting
in
with
the
style
despite
its
high
abv
it
was
highly
drinkable
i
certainly
recommend
it
as
it
is
an
interesting
taste
experience
from
france
review
translated
from

recommended
a
unique
tasty
brew
just
how
i
like
them
smelled
primarily
fruity
with
apples
and
cherries
taste
was
tart
and
dry
tangy
sour
fruits
with
a
somewhat
bitter
finish
carbonated
crisp
somewhat
thin
mouthfeel
enjoyable
as
something
to
sip
with
a
light
meal
on
a
warm
evening
a
little
fruity
and
sour
for
my
general
tastes
but
a
decent
choice
overall
definitely
interesting
and
complex
this
beer
was
interesting
in
that
the
mouthfeel
flavor
and
finish
were
all
what
i
would
imagine
the
result
to
be
if
you
mixed
a
lambic
and
a
flemish
sour
together
at
various
sips
and
times
i
detected
fruity
sweet
sour
spicy
and
a
hint
of
the
8
alcohol
different
but
not
bad
at
all
mediumbodied
and
smooth
this
is
a
nice
sweet
treat
despite
the
alcohol
level
which
is
hardly
noticeable
this
makes
a
nice
summer
night
sipping
brew
choice
also
would
pair
well
with
lamb
a
classic
for
the
style
it
poured
a
hazy
amber
with
5mm
of
head
it
exhibited
a
cherry
fruitysourness
in
its
bouquet
it
didnt
have
a
drysourness
like
a
berliner
weisse
would
rather
it
had
this
sweetsour
dichotomy
going
on
that
certain
fruits
provide
that
makes
you
pucker
tart
would
be
the
best
word
i
suppose
not
very
drinkablesessionable
but
i
still
enjoyed
it
full
of
bready
flavors

with

it

is

really
a
bdg
nice
brew
though
sampled
from
both
can
and
bottle
among
any
of
the
better
amber
ales
or
biere
de

seems
the
most
popular
of
this
brewery
pours
with
fairly
weak
retention
a
crystal
amber
in
colour
strong
aroma
good
mouthfeel
and
agreeable
flavour
light
roast
caramel
malt
some
chewy
presence
though
mouthfeel
a
little
light
tad
watery
alcohol
becomes
more
noticeable
as
it
warms
overall
good
malt
nice
subtle
blending
among
the
best
of
french
beers
ive
had
flavor
lives
up
to
aroma
light
on
the
mouth
with
a
nice
touch
of
liveliness
but
the
body
still
seems
substantial
if
that
makes
sense
caramel
malty
flavors
at
the
top
yeasty
spicy
flavor
from
the
beginning
goes
all
the
way
to
the
finish
a
touch
of
sour
fruit
in
the
middle
counters
the
malty
caramel
component
the
back
has
some
alcohol
esters
and
pepper
components
finishes
with
a
touch
of
a
floral
element
and
some
residual
sugars
complex
delicate
full

i
need
to
get
this

brew
d
goes
down
fairly
easy
for
a
beer
with
an
abv
of

a
very
interesting
style
i
look
forward
to
trying
more
vareties
this
was
one
of
the
sweeter
biere
de
gardes
ive
had
not
much
in
the
way
of
earthy
flavors
unfortunately
it
seems
less
of
a
rustic
beer
than
other
bdgs
i
e
jenlain
a
good
beer
overall
maybe
my
choice
of
shrimp
and
beef
wraps
were
not
the
best
with
this
great
ale
but
i
loved
the
ale
anyway
overall
surprised
me
i
have
to
say
i
first
sampled
this
years
ago
on
a
trip
to
france
and
the
fermiebrasserie
beck
and
their
marvelous
hommelpap
back
then
i
recall
this
being
less
palatable
but
now
it
impresses
maybe
its
changed
who
knows
i
do
note
with
interest
that
my
penciled
entry
into
my
woodsrigley
beers
of
france
book
from
the
late
90s
has
it
listed
at
only
7
5
interesting
cost
me
8
99
and
whilst
it
is
at
the
higher
end
of
what
i
usually
pay
it
did
not
disappoint
well
worth
a
try
or
a
revisit
if
you
were
disappointed
first
time
around
like
i
was
an
ok
beer
is
the
best
i
can
say
not
any
obvious
faults
except
the
low
carbonation
but
not
that
drinkable
overall
an
excellent
beer
very
drinkable
recommended
always
a
strong
choice
for
an
amber
biere
de
garde
that
i
oft
skip
over
in
favor
of
jenlain
very
earthy
beer
in
many
respects
cheers
i
feel
this
is
a
little
thick
and
syrupy
going
done
and
the
high
abv
does
limit
drinkability
nonetheless
this
is
an
excellent
beer
and
i
will
be
buying
it
again
im
currently
reading
markowskis
farmhouse
ales
which
is
a
wonderful
study
of
the
biere
de
garde
and
saison
styles
like
the
bottle
label
he
lists
this
as
a
biere
de
garde
while
his
descriptions
are
great
tasting
is
believing
this
particular
example
combines
a
healthy
dose
of
malts
with
complex
aromas
and
flavors
and
does
it
all
without
being
overbearing
zenlike
subtly
and
balance
the
label
says
biere
de
garde
but
its
here
as
a
saison
whatever
poured
out
to
a
pumpkin
orange
color
with
a
well
formed
12
inch
head
and
good
lacing
around
the
interior
of
the
glass
aromas
of
caramel
sweet
spice
pumpkins
and
some
earthy
notes
taste
was
medium
bodied
and
slightly
complex
flavors
of
fruits
spices
sugar
and
ginger
were
present
as
was
some
hints
of
herbs
not
bad
mouthfeel
was
fair
not
too
weak
yet
filling
enough
to
make
the
beer
quaffable
fair
drinkability
this
brew
wasnt
bad
overall
ill
likely
try
some
of
the
brewers
other
offerings
this
particular
choulette
might
keep
its
pants
on
but
its
in
no
way
less
alluring
nice
this
beer
looks
great
sitting
in
a
chalice
tawny
reddish
brown
with
white
lacing
malt
on
the
nose
with
hints
of
hops
this
is
a
very
rounded
amber
farmhouse
ale
autumn
flavours
make
this
almost
like
a
french
fall
beer
a
slight
belgian
type
finish
lets
you
know
the
region
very
drinkable
and
quite
straightforward
in
its
approach
a

a

i
like
it
although
it

my

i
would
recommend
this
one
this
is
more
sophisticated
than
i
would
have
expected
really
a
subtle
beautiful
well
balanced
beer
just
tops
the
packaging
consisted
of
a
green
750
ml
bottle
with
a
champagne
style
cork
and
a
wire
cage
when
the
cork
was
pulled
a
satisfying
pop
revealed
that
the
yeast
had
been
nicely
active
in
the
bottle
poured
into
a
16
oz
wine
goblet
the
body
was
clear
amber
red
with
moderate
carbonation
and
could
be
easily
mistaken
for
a
wine
the
aroma
was
also
somewhat
wine
like
with
notes
of
cherry
and
oak
and
very
little
if
any
hops
the
taste
was
smooth
and
refreshing
the
body
was
very
dry
and
woody
with
an
astringent
tartness
but
almost
no
sourness
fruits
like
cherries
red
grapes
and
pears
were
also
abundant
floral
hops
showed
up
in
the
middle
of
the
peppery
finish
mouthfeel
was
surprisingly
full
this
bière
de
garde
tasted
much
maltier
than
my
previous
experiences
with
beers
from
the
related
style
saison
and
exhibited
fewer
funky
flavors
overall
this
was
quite
an
enjoyable
beer
which
will
most
definitely
turn
me
into
trying
more
of
its
brethren

i
may
have
to

this

again
a

but
well
worth
it
especially
if
you
in
to
the
biere

my
buddy
calls
this
beer
the
french
defender
pours
a
orangy

with
hints

profile

with

as
well
finishes
a
bit
dry
and
smooth
recommended
if
you
like
the
biere
de

style
alcohol
is
noticable
but
surely
not
overwhelming
this
beers
highest
marks
come
in
the
nice
pour
a
big
pillowey
head
that
settles
nicely
and
sticky
a
nice
medium
amber
color
to
enjoy
aroma
is
like
powdered
sugar
almost
with
some
slight
spicey
notes
and
pizza
dough
aromas
taste
is
definently
malty
with
a
little
irony
taste
i
didnt
think
it
was
overly
sweet
supposed
to
be
good
with
food
will
have
my
other
with
dinner
flavor
has
nice
malt
at
start
very
sweet
but
finishes
very
dry
with
a
like
acidicness
that
keeps
it
from
being
cloying
more
body
then
other
bier
de
gardes
samples
also
more
alcohol
in
the
finish
a
nice
spicy
hop
finish
malt
is
still
very
simple
but
great
complexity
with
nice
muskyness
working
well
with
floral
and
estery
character
well
balanced
this
was
the
best
of
5
bier
de
gardes
sampled
in
one
night
still
though
i
dont
really
care
for
the
style
very
nice
biere

deep
amber
colour
lots
of
caramel
malt
flavours
slightly
sticky
sweet
start
but
quite
dry
bitter
slaty
finish
i
quite
liked
it
but
a
bit
sticky
for
me
o
a
really
nice
accessible
biere
de
garde
on
the
sweeter
side
of
the
style
a
great
table
beer
for
thanksgiving
quite
a
bit
of
carbonation
lacks
flavor
depth
for
me
probably
the
style
of
beer
on
tap
at
lost
abbey
in
san
marcos
not
my
favorite
style
but
this
was
really
disappointing
final
score
3
30
i
enjoyed
it
i
had
no
expectations
i
would
like
to
see
other
offerings
from
this
style
o
strong
abv
for
style
this
is
an
extremely
drinkable
extra
ale
with
no
bite
at
the
front
of
the
taste
it
is
very
smooth
throughout
with
just
a
bit
of
hops
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
with
a
bit
of
tangy
citrus
as
well
the
flavor
is
mild
which
is
both
good
and
yet
also
leaves
you
looking
for
a
bit
more
taste
too
well
crafted
its
greatest
quality
is
its
smoothness
very
nice
table
beer
wont
overpower
any
foods
esp
lighter
summer
fare
great
value
for
the
money
too
got
this
corked
and
caged
750ml
for
under
9
o
first
experience
with
this
style
of
beer
was
interesting
and
ill
give
gift
of
the
magi
by
la
a
try
too
overall
straightforward
but
tasty
despite
the
name
this
isnt
avant
garde
for
the
style
this
slots
in
nicely
between
lost
abbeys
devotion
and
their
abbey
dubbel
and
would
be
a
good
introductory
beer
for
the
style
o
overall
bdg
isnt
my
favorite
style
but
this
is
a
nice
offering
a
bit
rich
and
syrupy
and
chewy
for
what
i
like
in
this
style
but
the
toasted
malt
is
nice
the
caramel
and
thickness
make
it
feel
like
an
old
barleywine
this
beer
shouldve
been
consumed
a
while
ago
overall
a
pretty
solid
beer
its
not
doing
anything
crazy
but
still
a
satisfying
beer
gets
pretty
bitter
once
it
warms
o
4
5
on
draft
at
pizzacato
in
san
diego
pours
deep
golden
clear
with
a
big
creamy
white
head
hay
aroma
some
yeast
with
light
pale
malt
sweetness
flavor
is
very
light
hay
and
hops
again
with
light
malt
honey
sweetness
does
not
finish
particularly
clean
or
crisp
and
there
is
lingering
yeast
on
the
palate
relatively
light
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
this
tasted
much
like
a
standard
helles
lager
to
me
when
i
was
expecting
a
bit
more
farmhouse
and
light
yeasty
goodness
only
ok
in
my
book
o
this
was
an
old
bottle
im
sure
if
it
falls
off
with
age
or
improves
fairly
drinkable
with
a
curious
taste
my
first
lost
abbey
beer
to
try
pours
into
my
hennepin
glass
a
slight
hazed
peach
color
with
a
great
looking
thick
one
finger
off
white
head
that
leaves
a
nice
full
ring
of
broken
lace
as
it
settles
ever
so
slowly
i
pick
up
vanilla
with
a
peaches
creamlike
notesome
mildy
nutty
pilsner
malt
as
well
flavors
of
nutty
pilsner
maltsvanillaand
a
light
tart
green
apple
in
the
finish
a
great
food
beer
with
alot
of
richness
and
subtle
flavors
o
nice
overall
just
not
something
id
go
out
of
the
way
to
search
out
the
body
was
was
on
the
light
side
of
medium
and
the
finish
was
so
light
as
to
be
nonexistent
drinkability
would
have
been
ok
except
for
the
weird
funk
and
ashtray
taste
overall
not
terrible
but
i
was
expecting
more
o
a
good
beire
de
garde
typical
of
the
style
from
my
experience
which
isnt
a
lot
for
this
style
a
beer
i
could
drink
in
the
summer
sitting
in
the
yard
relaxing
o
started
out
really
great
with
a
beautiful
appearance
and
really
great
and
aromatic
presence
in
the
glass
unfortunately
perhaps
the
age
hurt
this
one
with
the
medicinal
bitterness
overpowering
the
more
delicate
fruitiness
maybe
i
will
seek
out
a
fresher
bottle
for
comparison
had
high
hopes
on
opening
and
suffered
a
bit
of
a
letdown
in
the
taste
test
still
plenty
drinkable
and
enjoyable
but
what
the
aroma
promised
could
have
been
something
great
if
the
flavor
lived
up
to
it
ov
i
really
like
this
beer
and
feel
the
biere
de
garde
style
is
underrated
the
flavours
were
really
nice
which
is
the
main
aspect
of
any
beer
it
paired
very
well
with
my
mushroom
burger
on
multigrain
bread
with
salsa
veggies
and
swiss
definitely
a
good
food
beer
for
light
to
moderate
fare
overall
good
not
great
every
beer
ive
had
from
this
brewer
has
been
fantastic
so
my
expectations
were
high
not
a
repeat
buy
for
me
o
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
and
has
some
interesting
aromas
and
flavors
but
the
dryness
seems
unusual
for
the
style
and
cuts
through
instead
of
emphasizing
the
malty
and
earthy
flavors
a
fun
if
understated
brew
the
pour
is
a
little
hazy
light
orangey
yellow
with
a
finger
or
two
of
white
head
nice
lacing
left
behind
the
nose
is
yeasty
just
past
neutral
on
the
acid
front
some
fruit
and
gentle
candy
sugar
notes
the
flavor
is
surprisingly
subtle
not
intense
or
aggressive
at
all
more
of
like
a
high
class
session
ale
well
balanced
interesting
flavors
and
good
carbonation
with
an
airy
texture
and
an
easier
feel
than
7
abv
would
usually
allow
for
some
sugar
in
the
finish
but
it
isnt
too
much
and
there
is
a
summery
vibe
to
this
beyond
a
saison
grassy
and
spunky
exacerbated
by
bright
bubbling
i
like
the
feel
of
this
more
than
anything
clean
finish
but
not
dry
especially
compared
to
some
other
lost
abbey
stuff
overall
a
very
well
made
beer
one
that
could
be
an
every
day
drink
for
me
if
it
wasnt
so
expensive
but
damn
its
refreshing
satisfying
and
yet
undifferentiated
in
some
ways
bright
orange
in
body
with
white
bubbly
head
that
stays
as
a
thin

aroma

citrus
horse

tastes

mild

towards

medium

with

very
prickly
a
pleasant
drink
that
features
more
citrus
than
horse
blanket
good
choice
for
food
pairings
with
its
bubbly
mouthfeel
to
clean
the
palate
soft
delicate

on
the

with

bitterness
mild
alcohol
on
the

of
the
fruit
lends
to
a
slightly

finish
but
again
this
is
balances
by
the
nice
balancing
crisp
bitterness
semi
sweet
with
a
balancing
quality
warm
buttery
finish
yet
the
finish
is
still

is
very
well
hidden
with
only
a
slight

noticed
after

overall
this
is
an
excellent
biere
de

style
very
nice
flavor
complexity
and
balance
very
smooth
and
crisp
to
sip
on
really
enjoyed
this
one
this
pours
a
cloudy
copper
color
with
bubbles
constantly
rising
to
the
top
for
a
thick
white
head
the
aroma
has
a
yeasty
banana
farmhouse
ale
scent
the
initial
flavors
are
wheat
mixed
with
citrus
that
create
a
well
balanced
flavor
with
the
yeast
the
texture
is
superb
while
being
light
tasting
to
the
tongue
with
a
dry
finish
o
this
is
an
excellent
saison
great
use
of
yeast
excellent
balance
im
not
huge
fan
of
this
style
but
this
was
great
o
a
very
drinkable
example
of
this
style
and
i
will
search
long
and
wide
for
the
sour
version
because
layering
some
sour
notes
one
will
make
a
fantastic
beer
overall
a
real
pleasant
brew
to
be
having
overall
its
not
a
bad
brew
and
for
7
it
doesnt
impart
a
tremendous
amount
of
alcohol
taste
nor
does
it
taste
bad
the
lost
abbey
collection
has
not
been
a
preferred
one
for
me
although
i
am
planning
a
nice
motorcycle
ride
down
the
coast
to
their
tasting
room
soon
o
this
can
quickly
become
your
sunday
evening
ale
it
is
an
impressive
ale
though
if
the
aroma
was
much
more
deeper
than
i
expected
it
to
be
this
could
definitely
entice
me
a
lot
more
to
make
it
into
my
weekly
rounds
price
shouldnt
be
an
issue
with
this
one
if
you
see
it
try
it
it
is
by
far
not
disappointing
but
also
not
a
must
in
my
book
bottoms
up
o
this
beer
is
kind
of
all
over
the
place
it
looks
fantastic
and
smells
great
but
the
flavor
and
mouthfeel
share
this
woody
astringency
that
takes
away
from
all
the
good
flavors
included
it
doesnt
make
it
a
bad
beer
but
its
just
not
as
good
as
it
could
be
still
a
tasty
beer
and
im
very
glad
i
got
to
try
it
pours
a
hazy
deep
yellow
color
with
an
off
white
head
in
the
aroma
earthy
and
cheese
like
notes
in
the
taste
tart
and
earthy
with
notes
of
white
grape
quite
smooth
and
a
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
small
dryness
that
leads
into
the
tartness
of
white
grape
in
the
aftertaste
missing
some
hop
presence
yet
nice
tartness
smooth
and
quite
enjoyable
this
beer
had
a
nice
cloudy
color
and
i
was
looking
forward
to
trying
it
since
i
am
a
fan
of
smelling
the
beer
i
was
expecting
a
strong
aroma
but
unfortunately
this
beer
has
little
odor
at
all
obviously
that
doesnt
discount
this
beer
its
was
just
deceiving
the
first
sip
had
a
nice
mouthfeel
nicely
carbonated
but
not
too
muc
the
taste
of
this
beer
is
subtle
if
you
are
looking
for
a
bold
flavor
it
does
not
exist
here
although
i
found
the
crisp
mild
taste
to
be
quite
enjoyable
i
say
you
should
try
it
o
great
beer
that
showcases
the
malt
in
a
fantastic
way
well
balanced
sweetnessalcoholhops
good
beer
to
keep
on
hand
in
the
cellar
o
a
nice
intro
to
this
style
a
good
spring
beer
o
pretty
tasty
good
for
drinking
at
a
picnic
with
light
farmers
market
foods
as
the
day
winds
down
be
aware
of
the
alcohol
overall
a
nice
biere
de

that
i
often
overlook
it
sure
makes
a
fantastic

for
sour

some

on

is

this

has
a
lower

with
a
slightly
crisp

overall
this
is
a
good
beer
but
it
tastes
better
than
it
smells
overall
a
solid
tasty
beer
where
one
can
have
more
that
one
glass
in
a
session
very
quaffable
c
overall
this
is
not
what
i
expect
from
a
bière
de
garde
lacks
the
vinous
quality
the
carbonation
just
didnt
measure
up
to
the
few
other
versions
ive
had
in
this
style
o
this
isnt
worth
how
expensive
it
is
plain
and
simple
glad
i
tried
it
would
never
foot
the
bill
again
one
of
the
light
and
bready
beers
thats
impressive
when
you
can
pull
it
off
but
not
necessarily
going
to
bbe
something
im
all
about
as
a
recurring
customer
im
not
a
biere
de
garde
guy
but
as
far
as
they
go
this
one
is
decent
enough
theres
a
fine
hop
quality
very
small
built
with
a
belgian
yeast
light
body
but
bready
quality
that
is
probably
a
relatively
difficult
beer
to
pull
off
o
average
at
best
was
hoping
for
more
disapointed
in
this
one
750ml
brown
bottle
with
cork
thanks
to
julien
and
pierreluc
golden
blond
ale
a
white
thick
head
is
on
top
the
nose
is
unidimentional
grainy
and
fruity
cherry
the
grain
is
omnipresent
and
ackward
the
taste
doesnt
differ
from
the
nose
with
grain
and
maize
some
hops
in
the
aftertaste
medium
bodied
overall
an
easy
drinking
bière
de
garde
that
would
have
benefit
from
less
grain
and
more
malt
overall
decent
but
i
probably
wouldnt
get
it
again
so
many
others
out
there

try

i
was
won
over
with
this
beers
fruity
tendencies
the
sweeter
side
of
the
malts
are
uncovered
over
time
almost
rewarding
you
for
continuing
to
drink
and
discover
i
am
always
complaining
that
belgian
beers
have
too
much
candied
sugar
in
them
well
this
beer
seems
to
know
how
to
solve
that
please
make
the
malt
for
your
dubbels
more
like
this
one
i
had
to
get
some
to
go
and
will
look
for
this
in
local
stores
as
well
o
not
a
bad
beer
paired
this
up
with
some
brie
and
wassa
crackers
worked
out
pretty
well

be
a
good
weeknight
beer
on
a
hot
summer
night
a

disappointed
for
my
first
edit
second
lose

beer
the
look
was
the
part
of
his
beer
nicely
made
and
drinks
well
without
pushing
any
boundaries
lacks
xfactor
though
whos
to
say
lost

thought
this
needed
it
an
easy
drinking
biere

that
pairs
and
drinks
well
with

medium

a
lovely
clear

a
very
thick
and
rather
persistent
white

aroma
has
a
sharp
fruity
tone
like
a
good
cider
satisfying
flavor
is
mainly
malty
and
has
an
undertone
of
sour
apple
not
complex
but
fine
for
sipping
smooth
firmbodied
texture
has
a
fair
amount
of
fizz
and
it
leaves
a
malty
fruity
slightly
woody
finish
poured
this
de
garde
into
a
large
wine
glass
and
it
has
a
light
golden
tone
with
one
finger
of
bright
white
head
it
has
a
smell
of
fruit
such
as
pear
and
orange
also
some
spices
there
are
some
malts
as
well
with
a
bit
of
earthiness
to
it
upon
sipping
i
can
taste
pepper
hops
cloves
and
yeast
all
of
it
is
balanced
very
nicely
mf
is
medium
in
the
body
with
a
similar
carbonation
level
all
in
all
this
is
one
of
the
biere
de
gardes
that
stands
out
for
me
not
an
inexpensive
beer
but
worth
it
o
a
little
disappointed
in
this
as
i
am
normally
blown
away
by
any
lost
abbey
beer
maybe
im
just
not
a
huge
fan
of
biere

i
give
it
a
4
out
of
5
do
a
good
drinker
and
overall
a
good
crafted
brew
ooverall
a
nice
enjoyable
beer

goes
down
good
and
is
refreshing
had
this

in

2010
and
liked
it
a

better
than
this
tap
version
another
brew
with
thanks
from

it

down

towards

dont
really
jump
out
at
me

good

a
great

cheers
o
a
nice
light
beer
with
easy
drinkability
a
little

but
not
in
a
terribly
bad
way
othis
beer
was
actually
very
difficult
to
finish
i
love
strong
beers
but
the
alcohol
note
was
just
too
evident
this
was
just
a
gross
tasting
beer
dont
even
try
it
overall
a
nice
enjoyable
beer
refreshing
and
light
goes
really
good
with
some

do
the
drinkability
was
very
good

would
like
to
try

one
again

this

might
actually
pay
what
this
costs
regularly
if
it
were
available
in
my
area
a
good
biere

is
very
drinkable

i
just
wish
the
flavor
stacked
up
to
the
nose
and
that
the
unpleasant
metallic
flavor
wasnt
there
o
i
am
surprised
and
impressed
by
this
beer
given
some
of
the
lack
luster
reviews
i
have
read
it
is
a

this

afternoon
a
great
beer
experience
a
very
nice
surprise
from
lost
abbey
i
have
been
disappointed
with
a
lot
of
their
offerings
not
with
this
one
though
i
wish
there
was
a
bit
more
fruity
flavors
going
on
especially
for
a
bière
de
garde
though
overall
very
nice
something
i
would
recommend
o
overall
i
like
it
im
going
to
pour
another
glass
and
go
sit
on
the
porch
im
going
to
cellar
another
bottle
and
come
back
to
it
and
see
how
it
is
in
a
year
o
it
was
a
nice
beer
and
worthy
of
my
drinking
nothing
else
take
me
out
to
the
ballgame
first
the
only
bad
thing
i
will
say
about
this
beer
is
the
way
it
is
bottled
i
had
to
saw
off
the
top
of
the
cork
and
use
a
cork
screw
lots
of
carbonation
in
this
one
resulting
in
a
four
finger
head
of
dense
foam
and
wonderful
clinging
lace
the
color
is
a
9
on
the
srm
beer
color
chart
smell
is
floral
in
character
with
solid
fragrances
of
apple
orange
peel
lemon
and
earthly
tones
great
taste
of
green
grape
citrus
green
apple
and
hops
creamy
in
my
mouth
but
a
little
drying
on
the
back
of
my
tongue
and
back
sides
of
my
throat
carbonation
is
just
right
overall
a
great
brew
easy
to
drink
and
a
great
taste
d
not
very
familiar
with
this
style
but
this
is
one
tasty
beer
will
definitely
be
buying
this
again
definitely
worth
trying
definitely
worth
buying
again
bring
on
the
summer
so
we
can
really
enjoy
this
one
taste
big
and
fruity
sharp
bitterness
that
sticks
to
the
sides
a
tiny
bit
alcoholic
but
wellbalanced
by
the
creamy
and
smooth
feel
t
in
my
notes
i
wrote
that
it
tastes
like
a
saison
but
without
the
funk
something
very
earthy
about
the
taste
freshly
baked
bread
in
the
taste
as
well
along
with
a
slight
hint
of
earthy
hops
avant
garde
has
a
pretty
nice
complex
flavor
but
wasnt
the
best
of
the
style
i
tried
that
day
da
very
satisfying
delicious
and
easy
drinking
beer
the
frustration
with
the
cork
that
i
experienced
was
enough
to
make
me
consider
avoiding
lost
abbey
in
the
future
the
beer
had
a
medium
body
with
extreme
carbonation
but
the
right
carbonation
the
beer
was
smooth
creamy
and
easy
to
drink
this
was
my
first
for
the
style
and
was
a
little
unsure
of
what
to
expect
but
i
will
definitely
be
trying
more
it
poured
hazy
golden
lingering
bitterness
on
the
back
of
the
pallet
and
not
in
the
good
way
nose
rather
unimpressive
mostly
lagerish
it
did
follow
a
rich
malty
aged
nick
still
drinkable
yet
really
not
sold
on
this

still
want
to
try

white
head
and
a
moderate
amount
of
lacing
on
the
way
down
the
nose
brings
forward
quite
a
bit
of
grain
and
bread
with
some
mild
yeast
presence
and
a
touch
of
a
farmhouse
character
the
taste
is
mostly
just
a
bit
of
grainy
malt
without
too
much
else
the
finish
is
oddly
dry
and
a
bit
too
bitter
not
terribly
drinkable
the
mouthfull
had
to
much
carbonation
but
as
for
the
drinkability
it
was
a
beer
i
could
have
anytime
beer
is
medium
bodied
and
boring
there
is
nothing
of
note
that
would
make
you
think
that
this
beer
is
a
biere
de
garde
it
has
that
graininess
that
i
feared
from
the
aroma
at
the
back
end
of
the
mouth
i
suppose
when
push
comes
to
shove
its
just
an
ok
beer
a
pretty
big
disappointment
for
me
personally
d
the
drinkability
is
fine
but
the
uninspired
aromas
and
flavors
will
likely
keep
avant
garde
from
being
a
repeat
purchase
mouthfeel
is
great
for
a
belgian
style
ale
and
is
right
up
there
with
actual
belgian
beers
this
beer
does
an
excellent
job
of
blurring
the
lines
between
a
belgian
style
and
an
authentic
belgian
beer
very
refreshing
and
drinkable
this
is
a
great
food
beer
and
would
go
well
with
poultry
or
light
fish
dishes
pretty
tame
beer
good
but
tame
i
expect
more
from
lost
abbey
poured
ontap
at
the
portlost
abbey
brewery
the
beer
is
a
dark
pale
gold
color
with
no
head
the
beer
had
a
sweet
nose
to
it
with
a
pinch
of
hops
the
beer
tastes
of
very
light
flavors
blended
together
including
undertones
of
peanut
butter
oddly
enough
there
are
also
bits
of
hops
sprinkled
into
the
flavor
as
well
the
beer
has
a
body
somewhere
between
a
gold
and
an
amber
not
overly
full
but
smooth
the
beer
is
light
and
loose
finished
and
the
taste
just
up
and
dies
in
your
mouth
very
fresh
and
clean
on
the
palate
appetizing
refreshing
the
lees
add
some
complexity
but
mainly
this
is
a
nice
fresh
tangy
brew
that
is
simple
and
pleasing
quite
dry
with
a
balanced
bitter
finish
not
challenging
or
funky
in
any
way
but
very
nice
avant
garde
appears
a
hazy
yellow
straw
color
there
is
a
half
inch
of
head
that
leaves
a
bit
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
pleasant
with
a
mild
funkiness
the
beer
has
some
nice
herbal
and
tea
characteristics
i
do
wish
it
was
more
funky
and
bold
i
do
not
believe
that
the
beer
is
aptly
named
as
it
is
simple
and
certainly
not
out
of
the
ordinary
or
avant
garde
worth
a
try
but
not
something
to
avidly
seek
out
d
and
by
drinkable
do
you
mean
taking
down
the
whole
bottle
by
myself
then
yes
an
enjoyable
beer
glad
i
can
get
this
one
year
round
good
stuff
much
enjoyed
d
this
is
a
pretty
decent
beer
not
my
favorite
from
lost
abbey
but
one
that
i
wont
turn
away
worth
giving
it
a
try
sometime
d
it
drank
exceptionally
good
due
to
how
light
the
flavor
and
the
body
was
but
was
still
a
decent
beer
but
not
a
beer
that
i
would
be
excited
to
drink
often
medium
bodied
but
creamy
beer
the
carbonation
is
very
good
in
this
beer
making
the
beer
very
appealing
on
the
tongue
and
in
the
mouth
without
excess
gas
alcohol
is
barely
noticed
in
the
beer
and
i
could
have
easily
finished
the
750
ml
without
noticing
it
overall
an
interesting
take
but
definately
needs
to
be
paired
with
food
as
the
label
suggests
bread
apple
cheese
any
of
the
three
will
do
interesting
if
a
little
uncomplicated
beer
body
is
fairly
light
so
that
makes
for
easy
drinking
not
my
favorite
from
la
but
one
i
might
pick
up
again
to
compliment
a
meal
i
suppose
that
helps
explain
the
maibock
similarity
still
thats
not
a
bad
thing
this
beer
just
stretches
the
style
to
make
a
complex
and
interesting
beer
definitely
worth
checking
out
i
thought
this
could
go
fast
but
it
isnt
complexity
and
some
strength
of
flavors
chemical
booze
and
bitter
keep
this
to
a
sipper
range
very
good
brew
glad
i
gave
this
a
chance
the
medicinal
bitterness
puts
me
off
but
its
not
terrible
and
i
can
enjoy
large
parts
of
this
beer
just
not
the
part
that
counts
most
my
remembrance
of
each
sip
pours
a
hazy
coppergold
color
14
inch
head
of
a
white
color
good
retention
and
decent
lacing
smells
of
hops
yeast
sweet
malt
alcohol
and
slight
wheat
fits
the
style
of
a
biere
de
garde
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
hops
yeast
sweet
malt
slight
wheat
alcohol
and
a
hint
of
floral
overall
good
aroma
body
and
blend
a
really
nice
beer
and
a
very
good
biere
de
garde
i
think
it
could
use
a
tad
more
acidity
on
the
palate
but
that
is
just
what
would
turn
a
very
good
beer
into
a
spectacular
one
this
is
a
lovely
drop
avent
garde
pours
a
slightly
amber
golden
color
with
a
tightly
packed
head
that
is
just
a
shade
too
dark
to
be
called
bright
white
the
head
sticks
around
forever
and
leaves
wonderful
lacing
on
the
tulip
glass
before
i
go
any
further
i
just
have
to
give
lost
abbey
props
for
the
name
it
is
both
clever
and
classy
the
aroma
is
fairly
subdued
but
quite
nuanced
with
a
touch
of
toasted
malt
sweetness
a
hint
of
acidic
fruit
and
a
bit
of
musty
tartness
the
flavor
is
balanced
but
slightly
malt
forward
with
a
definite
breadyness
that
mixes
with
noble
hop
flavor
apricot
lemon
and
a
touch
of
toasted
malt
that
cellar
tartness
is
in
the
flavor
as
well
though
it
is
not
as
funky
as
say
your
average
saison
as
the
beer
warms
the
esters
from
the
yeast
really
take
over
and
it
becomes
a
bit
unpleasant
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
a
nice
slightly
dry
finish
that
has
a
spiciness
to
it
that
is
not
nearly
as
prominent
before
swallowing
the
drinkability
really
suffers
from
the
yeast
taking
over
as
it
warms
this
is
my
first
biere
de
garde
and
i
am
looking
forward
to
trying
others
in
the
future
d
i
like
this
but
have
had
better
in
the
style
the
toastiness
is
the
main
attraction
here
and
thats
alright
by
me
alcohol
is
a
tad
high
but
who
gives
a
shit
i
drank
it
quick
a
quencher
d
this
is
a
tasty
brew
very
good
for
the
style
and
i
like
it
nuff
said
very
clean
and
crisp
pale
malt
with
a
load
of
noble
german
hops
yeast
character
is
subtle
with
only
some
esters
to
enhance
maltiness
smell
is
of
german
spice
taste
is
spicy
pale
malty
and
alcoholic
bartender
mentioned
that
this
is
brewed
with
a
lager
yeast
at
ale
temperatures
d
somewhere
between
a
session
beer
and
a
sipper
a
whole
bottle
wouldnt
be
farfetched
light
to
medium
body
fair
amount
of
carbonation
could
use
a
bit
more
to
clean
the
palate
only
a
bit
of
alcohol
is
felt
pretty
nice
beer
drinkability
a
flavorful
yet
easy
drinking
beer
i
could
see
visiting
this
one
again
but
it
doesnt
make
it
out
this
way
so
no
luck
d
easy
to
drink
a
very
good
beer
cant
wait
to
have
this
one
again
been
a
long
time
since
ive
had
a
beer
of
this
style
this
one
sort
of
seems
in
between
a
saison
and
a
tripel
cant
say
that
im
a
big
fan
of
it
though
a
bit
too
much
herbs
in
it
for
me
and
i
dont
care
for
the
aftertaste
still
interesting
to
try
but
id
try
a
different
beer
of
this
style
next
time
not
exactly
my
thing
this
beer
is
all
over
the
place
like
some
big
beers
can
be
but
this
is
very
subtle
and
its
still
a
mess
not
a
good
integration
of
flavors
pass
this
one
pours
a
murky
orangishcopper
color
with
a
big
head
due
to
lots
of
carbonation
i
pick
up
a
bit
of
spicy
and
grassy
notes
when
smelling
it
a
bit
of
sour
fruitiness
as
well
maybe
a
little
funky
after
sipping
it
i
get
flavors
of
fruit
spicy
yeast
and
bread
this
beer
has
a
decent
drinkability
and
has
a
great
mouthfeel
d
a
superquaffable
the
alcohol
is
exceptionally
well
hidden
a
perfect
beer
for
a
warm
afternoon
on
the
patio
d
flavorful
and
balanced
not
too
wild
this
is
a
really
nice
beer
good
drinkability
with
a
good
balance
of
hops
and
malt
a
good
entry
into
a
style
that
i
dont
have
much
experience
with
overall
a
pretty
decent
brew
glad
i
tried
it
but
at
the
price
not
something
id
be
going
back
to
pours
a
murky
gold
color
plume
of
fizzy
white
head
quickly
diminishing
but
leaving
enough
behind
for
lacing
smell
is
a
very
faint
blend
of
fresh
cut
grass
dried
grains
fresh
baked
bread
mellow
lemon
and
faint
spice
taste
is
akin
to
biting
into
a
fresh
loaf
of
artisan
bread
with
a
faint
kiss
of
herbs
lighter
side
of
medium
bodied
moderate
carbonation
levels
finnished
as
dray
as
any
liquid
i
have
ever
ingested
a
nice
beer
somewhat
mild
but
a
plesent
drinking
experience
pours
a
hazy
milky
golden
color
capped
off
with
an
inch
or
so
of
rocky
white
foam
smells
lightly
malty
with
some
grassy
hops
and
maybe
a
hint
of
lemon
a
nicely
carbonated
beer
with
a
decent
malt
backbone
and
some
citrusy
hop
flavor
a
nicely
balanced
decently
refreshing
beer
overall
it
is
good
but
not
great
i
enjoy
the
belgian
produced
ones
a
bit
better
ok
this
just
about
tastes
like
a
nice
malty
bock
crazy
and
unexpected
super
munich
maltiness
and
i
love
me
some
munich
a
bit
of
toastiness
not
much
in
the
way
of
hops
in
this
one
perfectly
balanced
bittering
but
not
enough
to
get
in
the
way
of
the
malty
goodness
maybe
a
slight
noble
hop
flavor
reminiscent
of
sazz
very
light
belgian
spiciness
but
again
the
malt
prevails
pretty
clean
for
a
belgian
style
actually
a
little
etoh
comes
out
as
is
really
starts
to
warm
up
im
diggin
this
one
oh
and
it
has
carbonation
not
just
that
but
perfect
carbonation
drinkability
i
really
like
this
beer
a
very
good
and
bready
beer
with
just
the
right
spicing
nice
and
malty
i
cannot
wait
to
have
this
again
d
this
is
a
good
belgianstyle
ale
from
the
lost
abbey
but
seems
to
be
a
little
styleconfused
d
i
would
definitely
drink
this
beer
again
perhaps
more
if
i
could
buy
it
in
my
state
but
then
i
might
get
sick
of
it
very
tasty
low
abv
and
reasonably
priced
if
you
dont
factor
in
the
8
hour
drive
to
get
it
a
very
drinkable
beer
blonde
bier
de
garde
can
be
easy
drinking
and
delicious
when
done
well
which
i
believe
is
an
appropriate
description
for
this
beer
drinkability
relatively
so
a
bit
sweeter
than
i
was
expecting
im
going
to
pair
it
up
with
a
bit
of
cheese
right
now
and
see
how
that
goes
id
rather
buy
a
jp
style
bière
de
garde
in
the
future
overall
i
was
surprised
by
this
beer
as
i
had
been
slightly
disappointed
by
some
of
the
other
lost
abbey
offerings
this
one
however
hits
the
mark
and
ill
certainly
be
having
this
one
again
not
a
bad
brew
by
any
means
this
is
my
first
taste
of
any
lost
abbey
offerings
and
it
was
enjoyable
it
was
shared
amongst
friends
and
enjoyed
the
rarity
of
this
brew
where
i
live
means
that
enjoying
this
brewerys
offerings
may
be
few
and
far
between
ahh
take
the
long
way
home
have
a
saison
life
is
good
introductions
are
familar
yet
have
their
own
signature
earth
tones
grip
your
palate
and
finish
with
a
dry
crisp
note
as
they
should
mellow
times
come
quicker
with
the
avent
garde
as
they
should
at
7

take
a
sip
take
it
slow
enjoy
the
sunset
d
very
drinkable
very
good
example
of
the
style
tastes
nice
but
again
not
what
i
expect
for
the
style
its
almost
like
a
combination
of
a
saison
and
an
english
barley
wine
big
sweet
malt
is
balance
by
crisp
lightly
citrusy
malt
ends
straightup
sour
like
a
regular
de
garde
with
nodes
of
peach
and
lemon
drinkability
quite
drinkable
i
think
this
would
go
extremely
well
with
a
blue
cheese
medium
bodied
with
a
lot
of
earthy
spice
and
sweet
fruit
flavor
kind
of
nutyy
too
with
a
strong
malt
backbone
hints
of
zesty
peppery
spice
citrus
peel
citrus
hoppiness
cinnamon
and
sweet
alcohol
theres
also
a
bit
of
a
syrupy
mouthfeel
that
im
not
really
feeling
unique
interpretation
of
the
style
but
average
at
best
poured
a
hazy
yellow
color
with
good
carbonation
and
a
fluffy
white

a

sordove
lingered
around
it
sordove
declined
the
mouthfeel
since
was
not
pleasant
and
would
not
go
away
ok
beer
but
not
a
go
to
beer
either
a
delicious
albeit
slightly
sweet
saison
driven
by
intense
fruit
character
a
great
brew
poured
this
beer
into
my
chimay
glass
from
a
750
ml
bottle
the
appearance
of
the
beer
was
a
clear
blondegold
color
with
a
quickly
dissipating
head
the
aroma
of
the
beer
was
dominated
by
a
sweet
grassy
maltiness
there
were
subtle
hints
of
a
citruslemon
fruit
ester
there
was
a
buttery
note
present
in
the
aroma
as
well
could
of
been
diacetyl
or
caramel
malts
or
both
hop
aroma
was
low
to
none
the
flavor
of
the
beer
was
a
maltybiscuit
taste
with
more
of
that
butter
aroma
coming
through
in
the
flavor
there
was
nice
hop
bitterness
to
balance
the
bready
malt
there
was
a
slight
pepperalcohol
in
the
finish
but
you
still
get
a
clean
lagered
impression
from
the
flavor
like
a
wellattenuated
beer
should
be
perceived
overall
i
really
enjoyed
the
interplay
between
the
biscuit
malt
and
the
butter
notes
additionally
the
alcohol
gave
another
layer
of
complexity
that
i
enjoyed
bought
last
summer
poured
into
a
wheat
glass
label
has
a
nice
bucolic
scene
of
beer
and
cheese
by
an
open
window
rich
clear
copper
huge
fluffy
head
settles
to
a
super
thick
12
head
lots
of
steady
carbonation
looks
great
smells
really
nice
sweet
munich
malt
aroma
i
assume
there
were
a
lot
more
hops
in
there
originally
but
since
its
1
year
old
im
sure
theyre
faded
out
of
there
the
flavor
is
great
sweet
and
spicy
with
a
good
solid
bitterness
the
yeast
seems
to
lend
a
nice
blackgreen
peppercorn
earthy
muskiness
mouthfeel
is
good
rich
but
light
finishes
clean
and
only
so
faintly
coating
drinks
so
easy
no
sign
of
the
7
i
could
chug
this
stuff
this
a
really
delicious
year
old
beer
id
like
to
try
it
fresh
some
time
draught
at
the
brewery
gold
color
with
a
white
head
bready
malt
some
dough
and
a
spicy
hop
note
in
the
aroma
the
flavor
is
pretty
similar
with
moderate
bitterness
and
a
medium
body
pleasant
but
not
too
much
going
on
it
seems
to
follow
more
of
the
cleaner
lagerish
take
on
the
style
and
does
it
well
but
i
think
a
funkier
take
would
work
better
for
these
guys
i
guess
thats
what
gift
of
the
magi
is
for
but
i
wish
you
could
get
that
character
in
this
small
of
a
beer
i
like
the
taste
there
are
some
spices
and
fruit
flavors
going
on
that
mix
well
together
very
drinkable
im
enjoying
the
bottle
myself
tonight
and
not
getting
sick
of
this
beer
ddrinkable
for
sure
but
not
one
im
going
after
really
often
dgoes
down
easy
this
style
when
done
properly
is
one
of
my
favorites
i
think
it
is
an
overlooked
and
ignored
style
and
this
is
much
undeserved
i
find
this
to
be
fresh
bright
and
spot
on
well
done
drinkability
a
beautifully
balanced
beer
not
the
best
biere
de
garde
i
have
ever
had
but
still
ranks
high
and
is
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
for
7
this
is
an
old
favorite
by
now
but
its
a
beer
that
had
to
grow
on
me
its
not
intensely
estery
and
alcoholic
not
sour
not
bourbon
or
coffee
infused
just
a
pleasant
drinkable
ale
im
starting
to
think
we
need
more
like
this
this
is
the
beer
i
pick
up
virtually
every
time
im
in
the
mood
for
a
biere
de
garde
d
unbelievably
drinkable
wish
this
was
easily
available
to
me
nothing
wrong
with
avant
garde
just
very
pedestrian
ive
had
much
better
within
the
category
im
lookin
at
you
schlafly
the
tatse
is
good
and
smooth
very
easily
drinkable
not
your
traditional
farm
house
much
better
to
drink
drinkability
is
top
notch
very
impressed
thanks
mom
next
time
well
meet
at
lost
abby
to
have
some
on
tap
drinkability
good
this
is
very
much
like
a
collision
of
a
sour
ale
and
sparkling
wine
and
is
all
the
tastier
for
it
drinkability
is
decent
the
flavors
are
a
bit
less
distinct
than
they
could
be
overall
the
brew
is
tasty
and
a
bit
boozy
but
remains
quite
drinkable
d
a
nice
sippable
beer
good
with
fruit
and
cheese
this
beer
comes
off
stronger
than
it
is
but
it
still
is
fairly
drinkable
d
not
a
bad
brew
will
quaff
the
750
easily
average
in
every
way
beer
is
also
not
typical
of
the
style
biere
de
garde
is
one
of
my
favorite
styles
and
this
isnt
a
very
good
de
garde
beer
the
yeast
profile
is
way
too
neat
and
clean
however
its
a
very
tasty
beer
with
no
obvious
flaws
well
worth
buying
again
drinkability
wouldve
stuck
with
the
gooze
if
it
were
still
an
option
for
availability
my
wallet
but
definitely
fun
to
try
i
might
pick
up
a
bottle
if
i
ever
see
a
particularly
good
sale
on
it
but
it
didnt
blow
nor
drive
me
away
quality
easydrinker
this
drank
pretty
good
for
the
size
but
i
wish
that
the
flavors
had
gone
a
bit
deeper
quite
refreshing
with
the
lighter
body
im
glad
to
have
tried
this
but
one
bottle
was
enough
d
certainly
not
bad
but
not
outstanding
either
d
delicious
very
enjoyable
farmhouse
ale
pours
a
cloudy
orange
color
with
a
tall
white
head
that
has
good
retention
and
leaves
some
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
has
a
touch
of
funk
but
mostly
comprised
of
citrus
notes
and
a
little
breadiness
the
flavor
is
quite
fruity
citrus
with
a
touch
of
sour
and
funk
the
carbonation
keeps
things
light
reminds
me
of
a
barnyard
version
of
a
witbier
the
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
and
the
drinkability
is
good
tasty
poured
from
a
750ml
corked
bottle
into
my
basic
tulip
glass
appears
a
cloudy
muted
orange
color
with
about
a
finger
of
quickly
fading
fizzy
head
the
flavor
and
aroma
is
of
spicy
yeasty
bread
citrus
such
as
lemon
and
orange
peel
a
touch
of
caramel
grassy
bitter
hops
just
about
a
notch
more
than
medium
bodied
with
ample
carbonation
rather
quenching
on
a
warm
evening
not
to
bad
but
not
good
enough
to
justify
the
price
of
a
second
bottle
overall
a
very
drinkable
biere
de
garde
flavor
is
unified
with
a
tasty
orange
peel

a
bit
of

taste

bready
malty

with

flavors
peaking
through
an
almost
earthy
character
lingering
alcohol

the
finish

i
really
enjoyed
this
one
not
to
phenolic
light

fruity
with
a
touch
of
alcohol
md
light
bodied
and
very
crisp
excellent
carbonation
and
an
easy
drinker
nothing
remarkable
about
this
beer
but
a
nice
one
all
around
super
drinkable
because
it
tastes
so
good
and
not
very
strong
at
all
as
i
am
guessing
this
brew
fits
its
style
to
the
t
a
very
good
brew
and
a
must
try
a
tasty
beer
but
the
fruit
flavor
and
overly
orange
notes
challenge
the
notion
of
beer
d
pretty
easy
to
down
this
one
unfortunately
after
two
flat
bottles
of
this
im
not
going
to
be
buying
more
especially
at
the
price
i
dont
have
much
experience
with
bieres
de
garde
most
coming
from
american
interpretations
or
the
more
commercial
french
exports
but
i
have
had
a
few
really
good
ones
its
a
style
of
subtlety
and
simplicity
these
beers
wouldnt
be
worth
keeping
around
if
they
werent
something
special
like
tomme
arthurs
other
old
world
reflective
pieces
this
does
the
european
rural
towns
proud
and
it
also
makes
me
happy
not
as
active
on
the
carbonation
front
as
i
would
expect
from
most
northwest
european
styles
full
body
is
certain
appropriate
though
an
interesting
if
perhaps
challenging
brew
soft
drinkable

md
medium

carbonation
is

high

a
good
offering
but
a
little
disappointing
from

d
super
easy
to
drink
considering
the
abv
would
love
to
sit
under
a
tree
and
drink
this
away
during
a
summer
afternoon
bottomline
good
beer
moderate
price
i
found
it
on
sale
and
grabbed
it
not
to
be
disappointed
this
beer
would
go
excellent
with
a
loaf
of
freshly
baked
bread
your
favorite
cheese
and
fruit
apples
taste
follows
suit
with
a
light
fruitiness
sour
apple
perhaps
and
some
lingering
dried
fruitfig
flavors
carbonation
is
high
for
a
lost
abbey
brew
and
quite
welcome
given
my
other
experiences
plan
to
research
the
style
for
more
info
nonetheless
an
intriguing
brew
i
give
it
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
yet
i
have
my
doubts
d
pretty
descent
drinkability
goes
down
smooth
and
i
could
session
with
it
d
kind
of
a
let
down
for
me
but
still
a
good
beer
i
had
to
bring
this
across
state
lines
so
i
always
expect
more
in
a
beer
i
do
that
for
pours
a

my

noticed

we
gave

not

nice
holiday
beer
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
had
im
a
little
dissapointed
i
didnt
get
any
brett
out
of
it
though
it
probably
hasnt
been
aged
long
enough
overall
a
good
holiday
beer
as
in
enjoy
it
once
a
year
overall
nice
beer
nothing
to
crave
but
it
does
the
job
and
has
a
pretty
nice
complex
flavor
profile
its
not
the
most
amazing
but
it
definitely
is
well
balanced
and
tasty
reddish
brown
with
a
huge

medium

medium
high

nice

but
the
hop
bitterness
that
lingers
detracts
from
this
for
me
amber
with
blood
cherry
notes
and
a
loose
thin
sheet
of
light
cream
foam
smells
of
plums
raisins
amber
malt
some
bread
some
dry
desert
dust
and
a
little
bit
of
clove
taste
is
not
what
i
expected
sweet
malt
bitter
over
steeped
tea
some
hibiscus
and
rose
petals
really
pleasant
flavor
profile
here
for
me
medium
on
full
bodied
with
fine
overpopulous
carb
and
a
wet
finish
nice
beer
quite
surprised
by
this
one
kind
of
a
strange
one
here
sort
of
a
holiday
saison
if
you
will
pours
a
nice
deep
copper
to
red
color
with
a
dull
glow
and
a
bright
white
head
with
fine
retention
excellent
lacing
is
left
at
each
sip
and
there
is
just
a
bit
of
sediment
settling
out
the
nose
is
spiced
a
little
like
a
holiday
beer
but
to
me
yeast
was
the
star
here
its
funky
and
farmy
but
this
isnt
a
sour
beer
despite
the
brett
its
like
a
lesser
version
of
their
red
barn
ale
in
this
respect
flavor
has
some
sugar
to
it
up
front
and
a
dried
fruity
character
with
some
tartness
maybe
cranberry
in
complexion
with
a
lighter
grain
bill
and
that
wet
animal
yeasty
finish
the
alcohol
was
a
little
much
for
me
in
this
one
usually
i
like
the
huge
ones
from
the
lost
abbey
but
i
thought
this
would
have
been
a
better
beer
around
8
abv
its
just
got
real
boozy
as
it
warmed
which
went
oddly
with
the
yeast
and
the
residual
sugar
made
the
mouthfeel
a
bit
strange
as
well
carbonation
was
decent
but
i
think
would
be
better
if
it
was
even
more
ramped
up
body
was
a
nice
full
medium
a
must
share
bottle
i
would
have
been
wasted
if
i
didnt
have
a
few
people
around
to
help
good
stuff
for
the
holidays
outside
of
that
context
its
less
impressive
the
taste
is
a
lot
bolder
than
the
aroma
with
many
of
the
same
pale
malt
yeast
and
sweet
notes
progressing
into
a
more
virulent
biting
pepper
bitterness
lingering
to
the
finish
overall
very
smooth
and
really
sweet
easy
to
drink
alcohol
is
well
hidden
im
new
to
brett
beers
but
i
think
this
will
be
even
better
with
some
age
i
think
ill
look
for
another
bottle
and
cellar
it
for
a
while
to
see
what
happens
but
it
is
really
good
fresh
too
served
in
a
tulip
a
slightly
hazy
amber
pour
with
a
small
offwhite
head
that
receded
to
a
ringlet
and
left
a
few
dots
of
lacing
on
the
glass
in
the
nose
fruit
esters
yeast
light
spice
more
of
the
same
in
the
taste
dried
fruits
caramel
malts
ginger
a
bit
of
yeasty
funk
a
bit
of
hop
bitterness
and
a
fairly
potent
booze
kick
nice
melding
of
flavors
medium
body
moderate
carbonation
hot
but
drinkable
d
this
was
quite
delectable
and
went
down
easy
i
found
it
very
drinkable
making
it
something
to
be
wary
of
due
to
the
high
alcohol
content
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
high
strength
bdg
that
affirms
lost
abbeys
brewing
cred
overall
a
solid
enough
beer
but
somewhat
disappointing
given
the
high
expectations
i
had
for
it
which
in
hindsight
were
unreasonable
as
i
initially
thought
this
was
a
wild
ale
when
i
bought
the
bomber
the
flavors
were
good
but
too
subtle
if
the
gift
of
the
magi
tasted
as
good
as
it
smells
i
would
be
picking
up
another
bottle
of
this
for
now
im
content
to
try
something
else
from
la
certainly
drinkable
and
i
can
appreciate
the
craftsmanship
but
not
really
my
cup
of
tea
maybe
bdgs
just
arent
my
thing
im
still
very
excited
to
try
other
offerings
from
the
lost
abbey
the
taste
is
slightly
subdued
compared
to
the
scent
thankfully
the
mouthfeel
has
more
carbonation
that
leads
to
a
creaminess
i
would
not
expect
given
the
seemingly
lack
of
carbonation
back
to
the
taste
it
starts
of
sweeter
than
expected
and
personally
desired
with
a
toffee
caramel
flavor
the
flavor
gives
way
to
the
spicy
and
fruity
hop
presence
altogether
i
would
have
preferred
a
drier
finish
as
this
comes
of
a
bit
cloying
personally
also
the
interesting
yeast
complexity
did
not
come
through
in
the
taste
that
said
it
is
still
a
good
beer
that
i
am
nitpicking
a
bit
overall
this
one
is
pretty
sharp
and
acidic
almost
burning
the
palate
very
flavorful
a
little
over
carbonated
definitly
a
must
try
d
really
nicely
done
the
malty
farmhouse
ale
base
beer
is
taken
to
new
heights
by
a
brilliant
application
of
funk
and
fruit
from
the
brett
i
particularly
like
how
vanilla
and
cake
flavors
mix
with
mango
and
pepper
in
the
finish
to
leave
a
dessert
like
impression
that
is
sweet
and
thick
without
even
coming
close
to
becoming
cloying
an
interesting
sipping
beer
that
defies
categorization
maybe
its
an
imperial
belgian
pale
ale
but
i
wouldnt
call
it
a
bière
de
garde
on
tap
at
leroys
kitchen
in
coronado
o
delicious
what
a
christmas
time
beer
should
be
definitely
the
perfect
ale
for
sharing
with
friends
or
with
your
significant
other
on
an
intimate
evening
opening
presents
pours
a
murky
dark
orange
with
a
foamy
tan
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
fruits
and
a
caramel
aroma
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
medium
spice
bitterness
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
with
some
nice
flavors
pours
a
deep
reddish
orange
amber
color
with
a
thinnish
white
head
that
shows
moderate
retention
but
little
lace
the
aroma
strikes
me
as
quite
musty
like
a
barrel
room
hints
of
sweet
malt
with
a
lot
of
non
descript
spices
hints
of
bretty
funk
add
to
the
mystery
of
what
sits
in
this
glass
the
flavor
is
complex
and
a
bit
odd
really
up
front
i
get
an
aged
barleywine
kind
of
oxidized
caramel
malty
sweetness
some
spices
that
i
dont
recognize
sweep
in
to
counter
what
is
left
of
the
malty
sweetness
this
all
finishes
with
a
healthy
does
of
funk
and
spice
with
a
somewhat
menthol
herbal
edge
medium
body
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
and
a
sweet
syrupy
bubbly
spicy
mouthfeel
this
beer
is
honestly
like
nothing
ive
ever
tried
its
quite
different
its
quite
complex
but
some
of
the
flavors
dont
agree
with
my
palette
im
glad
i
got
to
try
it
o
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
offering
from
lost
abbey
i
really
thought
this
was
a
fine
play
on
a
biere
de
garde
and
the
addition
of
frankincense
and
myrrh
is
an
inventive
way
to
think
outside
the
box
o
it
was
a
very
interesting
beer
solid
overall
glad
i
shared
the
bottle
wouldnt
want
to
finish
the
bomber
myself
great
beer
for
the
cooler
nights
to
sip
on
not
a
beer
youre
going
to
drink
quickly
high
c
den
overall
a
nice
tasty
brew
that
while
even
at
10
is
very
easy
to
drink
definitely
one
to
give
a
go
to
o
a
good
beer
that
i
may
revisit
in
the
future
i
was
a
virgin
to
the
style
and
if
this
is
any
indication
of
the
norm
i
will
be
pursuing
the
style
much
more
aggressively
wow
this
beer
has
really
held
up
well
there
is
almost
no
oxidation
in
fact
i
think
it
could
go
another
two
or
few
the
alcohol
is
still
big
though
too
big
for
the
malt
really
dial
this
one
down
to
about
8
and
i
think
it
would
improve
the
beer
quite
a
bit
i
like
the
mild
spice
flavors
i
am
getting
not
sure
if
it
is
the
yeast
or
actual
spices
it
kind
of
has
a
cinnamonnutmeg
thing
going
on
i
dont
find
the
brett
to
be
that
much
of
a
factor
which
is
probably
a
good
thing
in
this
beers
case
it
already
has
a
ton
going
on
pretty
good
i
like
it
enough
to
buy
another
bottle
next
time
i
see
it
although
next
time
i
will
share
it
lol
o
brett
character
is
subdued
but
noticeable
spiciness
is
in
the
forefront
but
i
cant
place
the
spices
used
the
beer
is
drinkable
compelling
interesting
and
highly
recommended
this
poured
out
as
a
muddy
looking
amber
colored
beer
the
head
on
top
was
a
light
tan
color
the
smell
of
this
beer
gave
off
some
soft
dark
fruit
aromas
as
well
as
some
belgian
yeast
some
breadlike
aromas
were
on
the
nose
also
the
taste
of
the
beer
was
a
little
on
the
sweeter
side
which
wasnt
too
bad
there
were
more
spicy
fruit
flavors
in
there
also
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
was
medium
bodied
and
nicely
carbonated
overall
i
thought
this
beer
was
pretty
good
i
would
probably
drink
it
again
originally
reviewed
01032011
o
im
gonna
stop
short
of
calling
this
truly
comparable
to
boulevards
saison
brett
but
it
is
the
first
thing
i
can
think
of
to
compare
this
to
bought
a
couple
of
these
bottles
on
clearance
and
glad
i
did
i
remember
this
beer
being
decent
when
fresh
but
4
years
of
age
have
helped
this
tremendously
this
is
really
bretty
in
a
very
good
way
alcohol
is
noticeable
at
10
but
actually
kept
in
check
pretty
well
gonna
have
to
go
back
to
the
store
i
got
these
and
hope
they
still
have
a
couple
more
of
these
left
o
not
bad
but
not
great
a
solid
beer
and
a
steal
for
3
99
i
think
the
alcohol
content
kept
this
beer
back
the
alcohol
burn
took
away
from
the
light
feel
that
would
have
made
this
brew
stand
out
from
the
rest
the
aroma
seemed
subdued
for
some
reason
as
well
an
interesting
beer
but
id
go
with
an
old
standby
over
this
one
bottle
russian
river
snifter
pours
a
clear
dark
amber
color
with
a
medium
offwhite
head
that
disappears
quickly
scent
is
very
malty
with
some
farmhouse
aroma
and
wild
yeast
brett
some
burnt
malt
and
english
hop
aromas
some
dark
fruits
and
bread
as
well
taste
is
very
malty
caramel
and
biscuit
malt
with
some
light
bitter
hoppiness
a
bit
of
brown
sugar
and
brett
flavors
floral
notes
and
booze
as
well
mouthfeel
is
fullbodied
and
smooth
drinkability
is
fair
overall
it
is
a
decent
beer
but
nowhere
near
my
favorite
offering
from
lost
abbey
or
biere
de
gardes
o
a
good
change
of
pace
from
the
normal
the
brett
malt
and
hop
flavors
are
all
very
good
but
they
get
masked
a
little
in
the
end
with
the
burn
and
flavor
of
the
alcohol
still
a
decent
beer
lost
abbey
brewing
company
the
belgian
inspired
arm
of
port
brewing
releases
the
gift
of
the
magi
biere
de
garde
as
their
christmas
ale
featuring
bitterness
from
the
bark
of
frankincense
and
contains
the
smallest
amount
of
myrrh
which
is
an
herb
that
has
roots
in
ancient
winemaking
as
well
this
brew
pours
a
hazy
amber
with
flashes
of
gold
and
a
very
thin
head
that
leaves
no
lace
the
fruit
heavy
nose
features
hints
of
honey
malt
and
spice
the
spiciness
is
very
evident
on
the
pallet
with
oak
vanilla
dark
fruit
biscuity
malt
and
even
funky
earthy
flavors
from
the
belgian
yeast
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
helps
all
the
flavors
play
out
well
in
this
medium
bodied
ale
a
great
beer
to
pair
with
a
well
rounded
christmas
dinner
love
this
beer
not
sure
it
is
the
style
indicated
hardly
taste
alcohol
at
a
lll
worth
a
try
and
then
some
overall
very
good
brew
interesting
label
interesting
and
pleasant
taste
just
good
all
around
a
lost
abbey
beer
that
i
never
had
before
the
streak
couldnt
last
forever
and
it
turned
out
to
be
a
pleasing
experience
medium
body
decent
carbonation
bubbly
and
tingly
on
the
tongue
not
bad
but
i
wasnt
really
feeling
the
herbal
and
boozy
notes
on
this
i
prefer
the
avant
garde
from
them
for
this
style
overall
fairly
complex
drinks
much
heavier
than
it
looks
drinkability
is
fairly
high
overall
pretty
interesting
the
malts
and
yeast
really
play
out
in
this
one
almost
as
if
they
are
battling
for
the
most
dominant
characteristic
a
bit
boozy
but
thats
what
it
presents
so
no
surprises
and
good
for
a
xmas
like
beer
decent
esters
fruits
malts
sugar
additions
spices
etc
etc
i
think
i
remember
the
bottle
version
of
this
being
better
which
would
make
sense
with
a
beer
this
big
and
bottle
conditioned
but
it
could
also
be
my
memory
playing
with
me
the
alcoholic
quality
to
the
beer
is
very
distracting
too
bad
as
the
rest
of
the
flavors
and
aromas
are
quite
good
its
still
a
very
good
beer
overall
its
just
a
slight
bit
overdone
jd
owell
the
quality
seems
to
die
as
it
goes
away
also
the
carbonation
goes
away
quickly
started
out
great
but
could
not
stand
the
test
of
time
pretty
hot
also
definitely
wouldnt
be
a
bad
beer
to
share
though
o
not
bad
but
was
expecting
more
from
this
biere
de
garde
was
expecting
some
more
funk
and
belgianfrench
characteristics
seemed
like
an
average
craft
amber
to
me
apparently
the
tap
house
has
a
12
beers
of
christmas
thing
going
on
i
wonder
if
the
bartender
realized
we
werent
gonna
be
back
any
time
soon
when
she
gave
us
the
punch
card
either
way
this
stuff
pours
a
hazy
sunset
amber
topped
by
a
finger
of
dirty
cream
foam
the
nose
comprises
orange
zest
caramel
brown
sugar
nutmeg
and
light
fig
the
taste
holds
notes
of
pine
resin
caramel
sharp
swiss
cheese
brown
sugar
cinnamon
raisins
and
rye
bread
this
combination
does
not
sit
well
on
the
tongue
at
all
and
a
touch
of
booziness
makes
the
experience
all
the
more
unpleasant
the
body
is
a
lightleaning
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
an
almost
chewy
feel
overall
i
did
not
enjoy
this
beer

noted
an
obvious
brett
presence
on
the
nose
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
an
intense
tartness
on
the
tongue
now
o
overall
reading
some
reviews
going
into
this
left
me
with
some
pretty
low
expectations
although
this
seemed
to
be
the
brew
that
would
fill
what
i
was
looking
for
based
on
what
i
had
read
so
i
popped
it
open
at
first
i
was
pretty
blown
away
by
the
look
and
smell
and
it
was
on
the
money
but
then
when
i
tasted
it
i
began
to
understand
some
of
the
lackluster
grades
im
a
big
fan
of
a
boozy
beer
but
this
one
was
even
a
bit
much
for
me
as
it
warmed
the
booze
did
not
fade
into
the
background
but
rather
it
seemed
like
i
was
drinking
more
and
more
rubbing
alcohol
ultimately
this
brew
met
the
drain
and
i
moved
onto
something
else
the
appearance
aroma
and
mouthfeel
are
all
spot
on
the
initial
taste
is
even
okay
too
but
damn
that
aftertaste
is
one
of
the
worst
things
ive
encountered
in
a
beer
i
was
wincing
and
yeching
after
every
sip
i
tried
soldiering
through
it
but
i
had
to
tap
out
cant
remember
the
last
time
i
drainpoured
that
much
beer
dark
brown
appearance
with
a
very
frothy
head
strong
fingers
around
the
glass
with
heavy
lacing
used
a
new
belgium
tulip
glass
filled
it
down
the
side
till
the
last
1l
and
it
was
very
active
has
an
oaky
alcohol
smell
with
some
hop
undertones
taste
is
a
little
bland
to
me
it
seems
to
be
lacking
any
real
characteristic
it
has
a
lot
going
on
but
nothing
defining
overall
a
good
beer
just
not
one
i
will
be
keeping
in
the
fridge
pours

five
pillowy

8

for
a
caged
and
corked
750ml
bottle
from
julios
liquors
westborough
ma
really
enjoyed
this
overall
a
pretty
unique
and
balanced
offering
without
an
obvious
comparison
found
the
10
abv
a
bit
high
and
somewhat
detrimental
to
the
drinkability
drink
and
overall
overall
its
a
good
christmas
beer
im
glad
i
purchased
this
bottle
maybe
better
fresh
i
thought
the
age
may
have
been
beneficial
but
i
probably
wont
find
out
ill
pass
next
time
poured
into
a
pint
glass
this
brew
has
a
nice
amber
color
red
in
the
light
with
a
bizarre
4
finger
head
on
every
pour
there
is
a
strong
hop
aroma
over
powering
most
other
smells
leaving
spice
and
clove
in
your
nostrils
the
taste
is
not
as
overpowering
there
is
a
nice
malt
balance
to
the
spicy
hops
very
thick
syrupy
hop
body
with
strong
carbonation
for
our
session
this
was
my
favorite
and
despite
being
10abv
was
quite
drinkable
id
certainly
suggest
this
to
a
friend
i
wouldnt
mind
having
this
one
again
it
has
the
making
for
a
good
fall
season
drink
i
like
it
as
a
good
medium
paced
sipper
an
easy
drinking
biere
de
garde
with
a
surprisingly
high
abv
a
good
and
interesting
effort
i
have
had
this
beer
a
bunch
it
always
seems
to
accompany
some
kind
of
occasion
like
if
an
office
friend
is
leaving
to
go
work
somewhere
else
or
at
a
birthday
party
that
kind
of
stuff
it
adds
an
element
of
i
guess
specialness
to
this
beer
for
me
that
always
knocks
it
up
a
notch
i
also
really
appreciate
its
wonderful
smell
and
its
incredibly
boozy
taste
i
always
think
i
took
a
shot
of
some
kind
of
liquor
when
i
taste
this
beer
for
the
first
time
in
a
night
heavy
malts
and
that
bourbon
note
really
hit
home
and
i
usually
can
only
make
it
through
one
of
these
before
i
need
to
move
on
to
something
else
i
still
havent
really
found
a
food
that
pairs
well
with
this
beer
ill
keep
looking
overall
not
up
to
lost
abbey
standards
most
of
the
other
beers
they
make
are
better
in
my
opinion
the
beer
is
very
drinkable
in
my
beer
budget
it
is
a
treat
because
its
slightly
pricey
but
well
worth
it
also
its
a
nice
beer
to
share
with
someone
that
appreciates
quality
overall
a
solid
beer
but
not
as
special
as
i
expected
from
lost
abbey
give
it
a
try
if
you
like
the
style
pours
a
hazy
orangeish
color
to
light
brown
color
with
a
light
tan
head
in
the
aroma
spicy
and
a
dry
tart
white
grape
fruitiness
in
the
taste
dry
cinnamon
somewhat
fruity
especially
tart
white
grapes
a
spicy
bite
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
semi
dry
cinnamon
and
small
tart
flavors
in
the
aftertaste
nice
spice
and
nice
tartness
in
good
collaboration
with
each
other
hides
the
alcohol
quite
nice
for
the
season
im
pleased
with
this
beer
i
definitely
think
that
putting
some
time
on
it
did
it
well
i
wouldnt
want
to
try
this
fresh
i
think
the
alcohol
would
be
a
little
more
obvious
d
this
one
is
a
sipper
for
sure
the
alcohol
flavor
kind
of
subdues
the
maltiness
at
times
though
ill
see
how
things
go
as
it
warms
up
a
bit
im
interested
to
see
how
the
2009
batch
will
taste
in
comparison
maybe
this
one
was
past
its
prime
but
its
still
a
good
beer
d
an
interesting
beer
a
nice
sipper
for
a
winter
evening
mediumbodied
with
some
crispness
medium
carbonation
very
drinkable
for
such
a
big
beer
note
2008
vintage
poured
ontap
at
the
portlost
abbey
brewery
the
beer
had
a
very
pleasant
dark
redamber
color
with
a
light
head
the
beer
has
smells
of
nuts
and
greens
the
beer
has
a
very
round
flavor
with
a
good
balance
of
maltysweet
and
hops
with
peanut
undertones
the
sweetness
stays
prominent
through
the
finish
very
flavorful
beer
and
very
easy
to
drink
d
even
though
it
did
drink
pretty
good
i
was
still
dissappointed
on
the
lack
of
carbonation
and
hate
to
see
that
these
issues
are
a
real
problem
throughout
all
their
offerings
i
honestly
hate
to
see
this
from
a
brewery
that
i
really
look
up
to
my
bottle
is
2008
release
tasted
in
december
2010
it
was
aged
in
good
conditions
its
a
day
after
christmas
and
gift
of
the
magi
ale
seemed
like
a
nice
choice
overall
im
a
little
surprised
at
how
this
beer
has
been
rated
overall
very
drinkable
spicy
and
bretty
nice
sourtart
flavor
that
is
complimented
by
an
earthy
oak
presence
and
a
touch
of
vanilla
there
is
a
good
balance
of
this
flavor
as
well
as
some
peppery
spice
and
dark
fruit
notes
hints
of
cherry
raisin
and
plum
slightly
funky
with
a
bit
of
caramel
and
subtle
hops
an
excellent
balance
of
sweet
malty
and
tart
with
a
slightly
dry
finish
very
good
mouthfeel
best
part
of
the
beer
nice
mediumheavy
weight
and
a
good
creaminess
not
one
to
try
a
second
time
d
interesting
beer
and
certainly
worth
a
try
good
for
sharing
a
few
ways
as
its
a
bit
unusual
and
best
in
small
quantities
this
one
pours
a
medium
copper
color
with
very
little
carbonation
but
there
is
enough
to
generate
some
fizz
and
make
the
mouthfeel
very
good
smells
of
winter
spices
and
tastes
of
cinnamon
nutmeg
etc
light
in
flavor
and
very
drinkable
a
very
tasty
winter
beer
drinkability
this
brew
didnt
blow
me
away
but
i
feel
like
the
lost
abbey
is
putting
together
those
brews
for
the
folks
who
want
a
long
time
with
it
these
are
beers
that
need
to
be
taken
in
slowly
noticing
the
changes
in
everything
and
i
think
thats
the
point
by
the
end
which
makes
me
have
to
take
the
drinkability
up
to
where
it
is
this
is
only
the
second
one
i
have
but
i
do
have
a
few
more
that
im
waiting
to
try
and
ill
be
giving
it
the
same
window
of
time
to
see
what
develops
seems
like
this
is
one
for
me
that
deserves
all
the
time
you
can
give
them
d
all
in
all
this
one
has
good
drinkability
abv
is
surprisingly
well
hidden
but
will
catch
up
with
you
to
this
point
i
have
loved
everything
from
lost
abbey
that
crossed
my
lips
cant
say
that
here
still
a
good
beer
from
a
great
brewery
but
a
comparative
disappointment
d
this
is
a
sipper
its
a
little
alcoholic
but
very
delicious
vintage
2008
purchased
at
archer
liquors
pours
a
cloudy
dull
orange
with
a
thin
beige
head
that
quickly
recedes
to
thick
lace
nose
is
awesome
with
sour
funk
raisin
slightly
oxidized
nutty
notes
cherry
green
apple
and
some
fresh
lemon
flavors
are
caramel
brett
citrus
a
hint
of
cherry
and
a
nice
bitter
finish
the
body
is
full
with
average
carbonation
and
a
long
bitter
finish
this
beer
is
really
good
and
well
worth
the
aging
i
3
lost
abbey
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
dark
amberbrown
color
with
a
thick
frothy
tan
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
smooth
and
rich
caramel
malt
sweetness
with
some
nutty
notes
and
a
touch
of
fruitiness
there
is
a
faint
roasted
character
as
well
im
not
smelling
a
ton
of
brett
here
just
a
subtle
offering
at
best
the
taste
is
decent
it
has
primarily
a
caramel
malt
flavor
thats
sweet
with
a
light
roasted
character
and
a
touch
of
fruitiness
in
the
finish
again
the
funk
is
limited
and
mostly
a
background
effect
it
does
have
a
mild
alcohol
ridden
feel
its
nothing
you
would
have
to
sip
at
but
its
ever
present
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
solid
offering
but
probably
the
weakest
beer
from
this
great
brewery
d
a
decent
beer
but
not
one
of
my
favorites
from
the
lost
abbey
the
taste
had
a
lot
more
spice
than
i
was
expecting
or
wanted
and
the
alcohol
was
a
little
too
prominent
a
decent
beer
i
would
try
again
but
probably
wouldnt
seek
out
very
good
beer
doesnt
reach
the
stratosphere
but
tramples
some
well
traveled
ground
reaches
for
a
slice
of
originality
and
its
appreciated
what
an
incredible
beer
damn
this
is
a
solid
spice
filled
beer
from
port
brewing
the
sweetness
spice
and
noticeable
alcohol
are
a
bit
much
but
this
is
still
a
pretty
tasty
beer
this
is
a
pretty
interesting
beer
at
first
i
wasnt
too
terribly
keen
on
the
beer
the
hop
stuck
out
a
bit
too
much
and
none
of
the
sweet
malt
aspects
really
showed
as
it
has
warmed
up
though
the
rich
raisin
and
sweet
flavor
really
balances
out
the
bitterdryness
very
hoppy
beer
looks
good
in
the
glass
nice
mouthfeel
but
this
just
isnt
my
type
of
beer
too
much
hops
not
enough
malt
i
havent
have
too
many
beers
of
this
style
so
i
dont
know
if
it
is
representative
of
the
style
or
not
but
if
this
is
what
a
de
garde
beer
is
i
dont
like
them
the
head
dissipates
quickly
and
its
not
a
good
enough
beer
to
buy
again
d
its
sweet
and
theres
a
richness
about
it
one
glass
in
a
sitting
is
good
but
i
could
not
have
more
than
that
given
the
opportunity
i
would
drink
it
again
the
alcohol
flavors
spiciness
and
dryness
present
a
little
challenge
to
me
at
first
the
flavors
are
good
as
the
beer
warms
up
the
flavors
meld
much
better
and
the
dryness
and
spicy
flavors
mellow
a
bit
this
beer
took
me
a
little
while
to
get
accustomed
to
but
once
i
did
it
was
enjoyable
2008
vintage
the
beer
pours
a
brownishorange
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
brett
funk
citrus
caramel
and
pepper
the
flavor
is
more
of
the
same
with
some
nice
orange
notes
mixing
with
the
brett
the
brett
gives
it
a
little
leather
flavor
and
there
is
also
some
spicy
pepper
as
well
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
d
never
tried
beers
of
this
style
and
im
not
totally
familiar
but
this
is
too
sweet
for
me
a
glass
with
dinner
was
enough
for
me
interesting
though
and
from
one
of
the
premier
brewers
perhaps
the
most
premier
of
belgians
in
the
country
in
my
opinion
d
not
my
favorite
port
offering
on
tap
ironically
i
think
i
liked
this
one
in
the
bottle
better
drinkability
a
very
good
beer
but
not
excellent
i
do
like
the
plum
and
holiday
spices
similar
to
abitas
christmas
ale
could
have
several
md
very
warming
alcohol
very
present
it
was
nice
to
try
this
one
although
im
a
bit
disappointed
i
dont
think
i
could
drink
a
whole
bottle
drinkability
isnt
all
it
could
be
im
sure
it
has
its
fans
but
i
didnt
really
care
that
much
for
this
one
poured
from
the
750
ml
bottle
into
a
duvel
snifter
very
murky
ruby
redbrown
color
with
a
nice
light
brown
head
that
hangs
around
for
a
minute
or
two
aromas
of
dark
fruits
red
grapes
raisins
dates
brett
and
dark
brown
sugar
on
the
palate
this
one
is
fairly
yeasty
with
brown
spices
dark
fruits
caramel
and
alcohol
another
solid
effort
from
lost
abbey
gift
of
the
magi
in
an
interesting
release
from
the
lost
abbey
perhaps
thats
because
bière
de
garde
is
an
interesting
style
this
one
has
a
little
too
much
of
a
carameltoffee
flavor
for
me
it
just
doesnt
seem
to
blend
well
with
the
funky
brett
flavors
its
alright
but
doesnt
result
in
greatness
theres
too
few
bubbles
in
this
one
too
more
would
be
better
that
being
said
gift
of
the
magi
is
far
from
bad
well
worth
a
try
if
you
ask
me
overall
a
nice
clean
well
balanced
biere
de
garde
not
too
heavy
and
with
nice
pronouced
flavors
definitely
a
worthwhile
belgian
style
beer
d
i
did
not
recall
liking
this
beer
so
much
in
my
previous
tastings
of
it
but
this
was
quite
good
a
real
nice
fruity
beer
that
hides
the
alcohol
to
enough
of
an
extent
to
be
enjoyable
overall
a
very
interesting
and
fruity
brew
spices
bring
complexity
behind
the
general
candied
fruit
sweetness
very
drinkable
excellent
big
farmhouse
style
floral
aromas
waft
from
the
bottle
some
spice
and
pineapple
from
the
brett
yeast
dry
belgian
yeast
character
full
body
rich
and
dry
awash
with
subtle
spice
and
haylike
hops
some
mild
sweetness
and
alcohol
present
as
it
warms
brett
is
here
in
full
form
but
not
in
a
funky
way
more
hayfloralspice
the
dryness
keeps
you
sipping
on
it
for
awhile
nice
pairing
with
a
washed
rind
cheese
i
had
winnimere
cheers
to
lost
abbey
nice
offering
here
definate
winter
season
brew
a
bit
to
boozie
and
spicy
for
the
reviewer
but
true
to
the
style
i
found
myself
letting
this
sit
for
some
time
it
isnt
as
though
i
didnt
enjoy
it
but
rather
it
didnt
really
grab
me
definitely
unique
i
must
admit
that
it
could
be
that
i
had
hoped
for
a
little
more
for
the
10
99
price
still
not
bad
and
kudos
to
the
lost
abbey
for
creativity
decent
stuff
the
ale
poured
into
the
glass
to
reveal
an
almost
orange
color
there
was
a
light
tan
head
and
little
lacing
the
aroma
was
of
clove
brown
sugar
and
cherries
the
mouthfeel
was
much
lighter
than
expected
with
a
slight
buttery
feel
the
taste
was
mildly
sweet
with
maple
and
cherry
there
was
light
hoppiness
and
alcohol
in
the
finish
caramel
and
spices
toasted
grains
bread
yeast
and
sour
apples
does
this
sound
like
a
great
beer
to
you
first
aroma
was
of
apples
must
have
been
a
bad
day
for
me
to
taste
beer
because
my
beer
king
brother
recommended
this
as
a
good
beer
and
hes
always
correct
in
his
reviews
but
i
found
this
to
be
not
as
appealing
to
my
tastes
2008
vintage
bottle
making
room
in
the
cellar
and
decided
to
pull
this
one
out
poured
at
around
50
deg
f
into
a
lost
abbey
tulip
glass
the
head
receded
really
quickly
and
left
no
lacking
on
the
top
right
away
i
get
some
crazy
funk
coming
on
the
nose
always
can
tell
that
aged
brett
the
mouth
feel
in
this
bottle
is
no
existent
the
funk
i
first
smelled
has
calmed
down
into
a
nice
fruity
complex
but
does
not
come
across
on
the
taste
the
copper
color
is
really
nice
and
the
tannins
from
the
oak
of
the
other
range
of
flavors
keep
this
a
relatively
calm
beer
im
probably
going
to
pop
my
2009
vintage
and
see
how
it
compares
in
this
style
of
keeping
beers
over
all
a
very
nice
beer
2008
bottle
pours
a
beautiful
ruby
honey
golden
nectar
color
can
smell
the
funk
but
also
grain
oak
alcohol
maybe
pine
and
caramelized
sugar
odd
not
too
carbonated
nice
and
resinous
mouthfeel
sticks
around
and
adds
to
complexity
drinks
like
a
less
burly
barleywine
definitely
very
very
interesting
far
more
floral
notes
in
the
afterburn
alcohol
kinda
burns
in
a
good
warming
on
a
cold
colorado
night
way
but
im
sure
the
year
and
half
in
the
bottle
has
mellowed
that
somewhat
its
a
sipper
that
i
feel
is
just
a
step
away
from
being
highly
sessionable
biere
de
garde
beer
for
keeping
just
glad
i
had
the
chance
to
try
it
so
now
i
know
to
go
but
more
and
age
even
longer
love
it
this
is
really
interesting
different
and
odd
there
seems
like
a
good
biere
de
garde
base
but
the
brett
frankincense
and
myrrh
make
for
an
odd
mix
of
flavors
not
bad
and
worth
a
try
for
your
more
adventurous
taste
buds
drinkability
enjoyable
change
of
pace
i
dont
have
much
experience
with
the
bière
de
garde
style
but
i
am
assuming
this
is
a
bit
of
an
outlier
due
to
the
ingredients
used
i
would
like
to
revisit
this
beer
some
day
down
the
road
overall
it
went
nicely
with
the
spicy
charcuterie
i
was
enjoying
d
fairly
high
in
alcohol
with
the
typical
accompanying
flavors
so
not
my
favorite
lost
abbey
brew
but
still
very
nice
quite
a
nice
one
for
this
time
of
year
truly
a
winter
warming
bdg
and
a
real
gift
from
lost
abbey
poured
a
orange
color
with
a
nice
white
head
good
carbonation
nose
of
yeast
spices
citrus
and
earth
notes
taste
is
earthy
spices
and
some
booze
had
a
offputting
aftertaste
like
bitter
buttery
or
something
mouthfeel
is
heavy
flay
and
bad
not
a
fan
and
not
drinkable
drain
pour
on
a
lost
abbey
indeed
in
my
opinion
this
greatly
improves
with
at
least
a
year
or
two
on
it
as
the
brett
has
time
to
develop
and
really
carves
this
beer
into
a
much
better
being
that
it
is
fresh
i
have
updated
this
review
based
upon
that
d
good
complex
but
drinkable
this
typically
isnt
my
style
of
beer
but
i
had
no
problems
getting
this
one
down
this
beer
completely
lacked
any
kind
of
fruity
funky
flavor
i
was
looking
for
it
was
lacking
of
body
taste
but
certainly
not
alcohol
drinkability
is
pretty
good
nice
funky
strong
biere
de
garde
im
glad
i
let
it
sit
based
on
other
reviews
of
it
being
too
boozy
fresh
the
strength
is
here
but
its
clean
and
fairly
well
hidden
by
the
brett
overall
decent
beer
at
best
maybe
carbonation
would
help
i
hope
these
guys
fix
their
problems
soon
next
year
i
will
certainly
be
seeking
out
a
few
bottles
to
have
on
hand
for
the
holiday
season
it
felt
much
more
like
a
liquor
in
the
mouth
than
a
beer
id
say
due
to
the
unique
taste
and
thin
mouthfeel
many
would
not
find
it
too
drinkable
however
i
found
it
quite
drinkable
in
a
liquor
kind
of
way
i
poured
from
a
750
ml
bottle
into
a
snifter
it
pours
a
murkydark
ruby
red
with
a
big
white
effervescent
head
the
aroma
is
big
on
funkiness
also
some
spice
and
green
apples
the
flavors
of
spice
and
funky
green
apples
come
through
along
with
a
sweet
alcohol
backbone
the
finish
lingers
with
hot
alcohol
the
beer
is
very
well
carbonated
medium
bodied
creamy
mouthfeel
and
for
me
a
sipper
a
nice
complex
beer
for
me
the
hot
alcohol
knocked
the
score
down
a
bit
drinkability
this
is
a
true
slow
sipping
beer
where
one
glass
is
all
you
need
in
a
session
very
flavorful
and
worth
seeking
this
one
out
overall
really
enjoyable
i
bet
this
will
be
even
better
out
of
bottle
and
after
some
time
d
i
was
quite
disappointed
by
this
for
being
a
belgian
pale
ale
it
didnt
appear
pale
the
flavor
profile
was
very
one
dimensional
and
hot
from
the
alcohol
i
would
not
get
this
beer
again
overall
sweet
and
boozy
good
on
a
cold
winter
day
this
is
a
very
disappointing
effort
pours
like
apple
cider
carmel
brown
with
ruby
notes
hazy
minimal
head
scent
is
mild
bready
yeasts
sweet
carmel
malts
watery
fruit
apple
pear
and
some
very
light
funk
taste
is
once
again
mild
but
good
belgian
bready
yeasts
slight
sweet
carmel
taste
water
fruits
like
apple
and
pear
combine
with
a
belgiany
banana
flavor
medium
bodies
slightly
grainy
feel
good
unique
beer
which
could
be
a
bit
more
agressive
in
flavor
drinkability
is
very
nice
booze
is
a
not
well
hidden
but
overall
a
very
good
beer
i
dont
really
want
this
ever
again
except
for
maybe
a
sip
to
check
if
it
was
a
bad
bottle
d
after
i
got
over
the
initial
heat
of
the
very
pronounced
abv
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
it
was
absolutely
not
like
anything
ive
had
before
not
sure
i
would
have
this
on
a
regular
basis
but
i
am
glad
i
had
the
opportunity
to
try
something
so
unique
75cl
bottle
dark
amber
with
a
medium
yellow
tinged
head
and
plenty
of
lace
hoppy
alcoholic
earthy
and
lightly
bretty
aroma
the
flavor
has
a
good
dose
of
caramel
a
toasty
grain
and
spices
with
bitter
earthy
hops
and
a
light
funky
and
tart
brett
edge
medium
bodied
with
creamy
carbonation
there
is
a
little
too
much
alcohol
but
it
dries
out
the
finish
along
with
the
ample
hop
bitterness
brett
is
detectable
but
very
subtle
alright
but
i
would
have
liked
this
better
with
less
bitterness
and
alcohol
d
tasty
base
beer
but
i
really
wish
the
brett
would
have
taken
hold
a
little
stronger
9
5
is
surprising
this
was
a
gift
bottled
for
my
efforts
in
the
phila
beer
geek
competition
last
spring
this
is
a
extremely
drinkable
beer
for
the
heft
i
really
liked
the
balance
and
smoothness
there
was
a
good
bit
of
yeast
at
the
bottem
of
the
bottle
but
it
all
went
in
the
glass
i
was
picking
up
a
tad
of
citrus
on
the
finish
very
nice
beer
overall
taste
is
even
more
of
the
dark
fruits
plum
dark
grapes
figs
just
wonderful
you
get
just
the
most
subtle
amount
of
brett
in
the
flavor
i
was
told
to
expect
more
but
it
was
just
lying
underneath
nice
component
to
the
beer
but
not
a
forefront
flavor
thoroughly
enjoyable
carbonation
was
good
medium
mouthfeel
and
very
easy
drinking
drinkability
is
very
nice
complex
and
very
flavorful
while
keeping
the
alcohol
almost
completely
in
check
and
the
flavors
in
balance
extremely
well
put
together
beer
d
really
different
so
far
this
is
my
favorite
bier
de
garde
not
one
of
my
favorites
from
lost
abbey
but
something
im
still
happy
to
have
in
front
of
me
its
worth
trying
i
suppose
as
something
different
and
unique
slightly
rich
to
have
much
but
the
ability
to
put
a
lot
of
this
away
is
very
easy
great
balanced
mix
of
flavors
carbonation
was
perfect
and
thats
about
it
a
corked
750ml
bottle
shared
with
psycohops
poured
into
a
pair
of
basic
tulip
glasses
the
ale
appears
a
hazed
honeyed
amber
color
with
about
two
fingers
of
quickly
fading
off
white
head
flavors
and
aromas
consist
of
tart
green
apple
hints
of
brett
and
banana
caramel
herbal
and
spicy
sweet
yet
sour
the
ale
is
lightly
carbonated
with
a
medium
body
and
a
bitter
finish
different
and
somewhat
tasty
overall
there
was
a
lot
that
could
be
good
about
this
beer
with
some
minor
tweaking
but
nothing
that
i
found
overly
exciting
worth
a
shot
for
the
curious
id
consider
this
a
failed
beer
from
an
otherwise
very
good
brewery
it
could
be
tweaked
into
a
good
beer
though
i
think
if
this
bottle
had
been
properly
carbonated
the
first
two
scores
might
have
been
higher
maybe
a
few
of
the
final
three
scores
would
have
been
as
well
gift
of
the
magi
is
not
for
everyone
however
if
you
like
belgians
brett
and
spiced
beer
and
are
open
to
new
and
different
exbeeriences
hey
i
just
invented
a
new
word
then
give
this
interesting
domestic
biere
de
garde
a
whirl
two
out
of
three
wise
men
give
it
a
thumbs
up
d
wow
this
was
one
boring
beer
sadly
ive
been
pretty
underwhelmed
by
las
year
rounders
the
mouthfeel
just
doesnt
work
well
with
the
flavors
its
too
thick
and
crunchy
with
some
barleywine
characteristics
di
think
i
have
been
infatuated
with
lost
abbey
based
on
its
brewing
techniques
minimal
distribution
and
generalmystique
but
i
am
starting
to
rethink
these
intuitions
based
on
a
few
prior
la
tastings
this
beer
is
very
good
but
doesnt
blow
my
mind
i
feel
like
the
brett
did
all
the
work
in
this
one
and
i
could
brew
it
myself
not
to
say
that
i
would
not
be
totally
impressed
if
i
did
very
well
flavored
and
decently
balanced
but
maybe
not
worth
the
14
i
paid

where

on
this
particular

as
was
the
entire
bottle
very
flat
the
aroma
was
hard
to
detect
but
was
very
sweet
the
taste
again
was
extremly
sweet
and
carried
a
funk
to
it
the
mouthfeel
was
very
smooth
as
there
was
no
carbonation
to
the
drink
i
would
hesitate
on
purchasing
this
particular
brew
again
the
overly
sweet
tones
were
not
suited
to
my
taste

try
to
grab
a
fresh

to
compare

very
weak
but
there
is
a
little
breadiness
in

quite

syruppy
with

i
think
an
increase
in
the
carbonation
might
improve
the
syrupy
nature
of
this
brew
it
is
not
flat
so
i
dont

i
have
a
bad
bottle
but
the
texture
is
a
little
on
the
cough
syrup
side
this
is
my
least
favorite
beer
that
i
have
had
from
this
brewery
and
i
probably
wouldnt
bother
to
buy
it
again
i
definitely
give
it
a
below
average
for
drinkability
not
very
interesting
flavor
and
syrupy
mouthfeel
i
probably
wont
finish
the
whole
bottle
this
is
a
disappointment
in
my
opinion
too
boozy
carbonation
problems
and
frankly
just
not
all
that
interesting
it
has
some
nice
elements
but
its
also
sort
of
a
jumbled
boozy
mess
i
was
excited
to
find
this
at
julios
on
the
way
to
ebf
but
i
dont
think
ill
be
seeking
it
out
again
next
year
im
not
a
brett
fan
but
its
just
about
the
most
interesting
thing
about
this
beer
not
terribly
complex
and
i
didnt
enjoy
it
very
much
disappointing
excellent
brew
overall
id
drink
this
one
again
but
id
go
easier
on
it
and
id
save
it
for
christmastime
im
only
realizing
the
significance
of
the
gift
of
the
magi
name
im
feeling
kind
of
dumb
right
now
derp
interesting
how
split
people
seem
to
be
about
this
brew
personally
i
think
this
beer
is
fantastic
and
a
bit
different
pours
a
hazy
orangeamber
smells
sweet
with
some
spicebox
and
a
bit
hot
and
with
some
fruity
esters
but
fairly
simple
the
taste
is
far
more
complex
honeyed
and
long
in
the
mouth
with
some
light
spice
some
bright
but
subdued
fruit
and
a
long
bitter
herbal
fruitiness
that
is
just
wonderful
and
nicely
balances
the
sweetness
on
the
front
end
very
smooth
and
delicious
and
a
nice
winter
treat
this
is
more
of
a
biere
de
garde
than
a
belgian
pale
so
keep
that
in
mind
it
pours
a
rich
woody
brown
with
a
thin
tan
head
the
nose
has
sweet
malts
spicy
yeasts
and
a
subtle
brett
character
taste
has
citrus
fruits
herbs
spices
and
a
bit
of
funk
medium
to
full
body
flows
over
the
palate
edit
im
sorry
who
i
offend
but
anybody
who
doesnt
see
this
brew
for
what
it
is
has
their
blinders
on
a
good
bspa
out
of
the
gates
that
is
spiced
with

the
spices

unique
brew
that
pushes
the
boundaries
of
what
make
american
breweries
american
drinking
this
makes
me
want
to
go
out
right
now
and
homebrew
something
that
is
purely
american
overall
this
was
a
nice
offering
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
the
funkiness
from
the
brett
as
i
didnt
know
this
beer
had
any
it
until
after
has
a
nice
complexity
of
flavors
was
hoping
for
a
little
more
from
this
one
i
definitely
am
not
a
fan
of
these
overly
malty
cloyingly
sweet
bdgs
and
if
youre
going
to
add
brett
make
sure
it
leaves
a
stronger
signature
not
enough
here
pours
a
deep
walnut
amber
not
much
of
a
head
or
bubbling
the
best
part
of
this
beers
appearance
is
the
color
for
a
belgian
this
beer
lacks
some
crucial
appearance
points
the
aroma
is
pretty
herbal
cant
really
specify
pretty
boozey
and
full
of
toasted
caramel
maybe
a
little
too
boozey
insanely
herbal
taste
upfront
sweet
boozey
bananas
and
candi
sugar
but
a
hoppy
herbal
and
earthy
finish
somewhat
chalky
and
sweet
but
with
a
somewhat
well
whiskey
linger
meant
for
sipping
only
a
bit
heavy
on
the
booze
i
think
the
addition
of
the
brett
gives
it
a
unique
taste
and
changes
the
style
just
slightly
by
adding
more
depth
to
the
beer
style
drinkability
is
pretty
good
nicely
balanced
but
otherwise
this
one
didnt
really
wow
me
im
usually
a
big
fan
of
lost
abbey
but
for
me
this
one
misses
the
mark
a
little
thanks
javier
for
bringing
me
this
bottle
from
city
beer
in
san
francisco
i
popped
the
top
well
actually
i
pushed
the
cork
out
but
it
made
no
popping
sound
hmmm
that
is
weird
poured
with
no
head
could
this
be
a
bad
bottle
i
dont
think
so
tea
colored
hazy
brett
and
hop
aroma
same
flavors
as
the
aroma
not
bad
for
what
may
be
a
flat
brew
the
tartness
was
nice
overall
i
did
enjoy
it
just
wish
i
had
more
experience
with
this
beer
if
i
have
it
again
i
will
edit
my
review
pours
a
slightly
hazed
reddish
orange
almost
coppery
thin
white
head
forms
drops
a
few
spots
of
lace
on
the
glass
looks
pretty
nice
quite
a
unique
colour
good
retention
smell
is
neat
quite
spicy
honey
sweetness
woody
some
floral
strawberries
and
assorted
fruit
cherries
the
myrrh
and
frankincense
addition
is
pretty
interesting
gives
a
spicy
character
that
is
unique
taste
is
similar
sweet
at
first
honey
and
caramel
some
toastiness
fruit
bark
and
oak
spiciness
or
astringency
has
that
neat
woody
character
from
the
spices
yeast
light
bitterness
pretty
interesting
stuff
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
hides
the
alcohol
pretty
well
i
liked
this
one
not
their
best
effort
for
me
but
certainly
unique
and
is
giving
me
ideas
for
my
next
christmas
beer
coles
rare
beer
fest
lighter
carbonation
and
spiciness
yeasty
some
apple
pie
candi
sugar
but
not
sweet
as
some
hoppiness
kicks
in
at
end
not
bad
but
not
too
drinkable
better
with
food
i
would
think
brett
perhaps
below
average
mouthfeel
a
worthwhile
experiment
more
mellow
from
this
brewery
and
not
their
best
hopedfor
result
some
people
suggested
although
in
previous
batches
that
aging
would
improve
this
one
i
am
not
sure
it
might
quiet
down
the
heat
but
so
far
this
is
disappointing
at
best
d
easy
to
drink
and
pretty
enjoyable
notes
decent
not
my
favorite
from
lost
abbey
bit
too
sweet
and
thick
for
my
taste
buds
overall
an
interesting
belgian
d
does
not
taste
like
10
at
all
not
overly
sweet
either
and
fairly
easy
to
drink
me
and
a
few
friends
easily
downed
a
750ml
as
a
starter
for
our
new
beer
sunday
gathering
this
is
however
a
very
good
belgian
pale
ale
and
a
beer
that
like
to
live
outside
the
style
guidelines
which
i
give
tomme
credit
for
pours
a
very
opaque
tawny
color
with
a
nice
off
white
head
on
top
low
retention
level
with
a
very
reserved
sticky
ringlike
lacing
wonderful
fruity
aroma
mostly
plums
and
pears
with
a
big
honey
note
light
funk
in
the
nose
this
smells
phenomenal
smells
syrupy
flavor
is
just
so
overwhelming
major
brett
funk
but
the
malts
just
overpower
this
beer
major
flavors
of
honey
pears
and
fresh
plums
with
an
expectional
funk
some
alcohol
esters
do
take
away
some
flavor
but
lightly
mouthfeel
is
very
warming
and
smooth
for
the
bite
carbonation
level
is
mellow
which
i
prefer
with
the
style
i
will
definitely
drink
this
again
this
was
the
2008
it
took
some
time
but
this
beer
found
its
way
into
my
good
books
tomme
arthur
must
be
one
of
if
not
the
most
prolific
brewers
and
the
idea
of
using
frankincense
and
myrrh
for
a
christmas
seasonal
is
an
idea
i
commend
although
this
fresh
sample
didnt
leave
a
great
impression
im
sure
allowing
the
brettanomyces
more
time
will
do
the
beer
well
luckily
im
stocked
up
with
both
vintages
the
alcohol
was
apparent
but
well
integrated
nice
malt
and
bitterness
blend
the
latter
more
predominant
with
warming
i
thought
this
was
very
much
a
strong
ale
nicely
balanced
with
an
apricot
aftertaste
and
more
peach
notes
it
was
not
overly
dense
but
had
substantial
body
and
mouthfeel
a
flash
of
orange
zest
here
and
there
and
a
muted
alcohol
backdrop
overall
sufficiently
complex
with
a
fleeting
but
refreshing
citrus
flash
here
and
there
making
for
a
most
interesting
mouthfeel
and
very
drinkable
beverage
thanks
jan
d
this
is
how
spiced
winter
beers
should
be
good
solid
beer
with
some
mysterious
spice
qualities
that
cant
be
teased
apart
all
the
flavors
work
well
together
complimenting
each
other
they
managed
to
put
spice
and
malt
and
hops
together
and
it
works
i
dont
know
if
they
used
frankincense
and
myrrh
but
whatever
it
is
its
great
drinkability
complex
but
lacks
carbonation
after
the
smell
i
was
surprised
by
the
taste
not
positively
particularly
the
hops
and
the
bitterness
i
considered
not
finishing
it
but
as
i
do
i
find
it
enjoyable
it
is
probably
a
beer
that
will
change
a
lot
with
age
as
brett
develops
and
hops
fade
this
is
a
good
beer
i
have
another
to
try
next
cristmas
in
my
cellar
i
dont
know
how
much
of
it
i
could
drink
though
d
masks
the
10
abv
really
well
probably
would
have
a
hard
time
polishing
off
a
pint
bottle
by
myself
but
could
enjoy
splitting
one
they
want
contemplative
they
goddit
totally
a
sipper
over
a
couple
of
hours
drinkability
looking
over
the
reviews
of
others
i
wonder
whether
this
is
not
a
beer
that
needs
a
year
or
more
of
age
i
recall
tomme
arthur
posting
that
the
brett
takes
a
while
to
ferment
in
the
bottle
and
the
lack
of
carbonation
others
are
experiencing
was
not
an
issue
in
my
aged
bottle
in
any
event
to
my
palate
this
was
one
of
the
top
offerings
from
lost
abbey
pours
an
amberish
brown
minimal
head
decent
lacing
around
the
glass
smells
musty
and
like
candied
sugar
upon
tasting
a
dry
beer
but
not
very
sweet
at
first
the
spices
take
over
and
then
a
hop
bitterness
kicks
in
more
bitter
than
what
i
was
expecting
from
this
heavy
alcohol
presence
combined
with
the
bitterness
detract
from
the
overall
experience
for
me
as
i
was
expecting
something
a
little
sweeter
more
along
the
lines
of
how
allagash
spiced
this
years
fluxus
not
much
of
a
fruity
taste
either
the
brett
gives
a
slightly
sour
presence
but
it
doesnt
dominate
i
guess
the
best
description
would
be
like
christmas
out
on
the
farm
somewhere
or
in
a
stable
go
figure
combines
spicing
with
a
dry
grassiness
not
a
bad
sipper
but
overall
not
quite
what
i
was
expecting
finish
is
long
and
again
tangy
fruit
with
some
alcohol
warmth
pored
from
a
750
ml
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
poured
out
a
cloudy
amber
color
with
decent
white
heading
some
nice
holiday
spices
are
immediate
to
the
smell
with
some
dark
fruits
heading
disapates
very
quickly
to
nothing
immediate
taste
malt
and
very
very
heavy
with
the
alcohol
aftertaste
with
a
bitter
settling
almost
unenjoyable
the
first
glass
i
drank
was
fine
the
next
i
must
have
drank
too
quickly
and
woke
up
an
hour
later
poured
out
a
deep
amber
color
with
a
tan
two
finger
head
that
quickly
receded
to
almost
nothing
into
a
12oz
tulip
lacing
slid
down
the
glass
with
each
sip
but
hung
around
till
almost
the
last
drop
the
aroma
coming
from
this
beer
hit
me
before
i
even
picked
up
the
glass
it
was
like
a
cornucopia
of
fruits
i
could
smell
cherries
apples
raisins
or
prunes
and
it
seems
they
didnt
even
try
hiding
the
scent
of
alcohol
which
i
didnt
mind
at
all
after
i
took
a
sip
the
taste
reminded
me
almost
of
wine
with
lots
of
alcohol
undertones
again
cherries
and
apples
were
very
present
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
oily
on
the
lips
but
finished
clean
not
too
easy
to
drink
due
to
the
alcohol
being
so
noticeable
i
wouldnt
be
able
to
handle
more
than
one
or
two
of
these
before
calling
it
quits
a
great
ale
indeed
drinks
pretty
slow
due
to
the
dryness
the
brett
didnt
really
help
or
hurt
this
one
d
i
was
really
looking
forward
to
trying
this
beer
and
picked
it
as
my
christmas
beer
and
that
is
exactly
what
the
character
is
of
this
onea
christmas
beer
its
a
good
beer
and
i
wouldnt
mind
trading
for
and
aging
this
one
but
the
flavors
particularly
the
spiciness
come
through
a
little
strong
2008
edition
in
750
ml
corked
bottle
2007
seemed
appropriate
for
enjoying
on
christmas
eve
it
poured
with
a
thin
beige
cap
that
formed
a
thick
collar
and
sheets
of
lace
great
head
retention
the
beer
itself
was
a
hazy
tawny
amber
with
a
constant
stream
of
bubbles
rising
to
the
surface
the
initial
aromas
were
caramel
and
light
herbal
and
floral
hops
a
bit
grassy
too
as
it
warmed
there
was
a
hint
of
earthiness
and
tart
acidity
light
herbal
bitterness
with
a
delicate
flavour
a
combination
of
caramel
sweetness
and
cereal
grains
alcohol
was
present
in
the
finish
along
with
a
light
lingering
white
pepper
spice
more
earthiness
and
tartness
appeared
as
it
warmed
moderate
carbonation
with
an
airy
light
texture
the
medium
body
was
a
bit
creamy
and
there
was
mild
warmth
very
nicely
balanced
overall
mellow
elegant
flavours
really
melded
well
together
brett
character
was
light
but
definitely
a
contributing
characteristic
and
the
year
its
spent
in
the
bottle
may
have
brought
this
out
more
another
interesting
and
tasty
brew
from
lost
abbey
though
i
wouldnt
put
it
near
the
top
of
my
la
list
the
spices
really
throw
a
unique
twist
into
the
beer
bought
at
ledgers
liquors
in
berkeley
and
saved
until
tonight
pours
a
muddy
brown
with
zero
obvious
carbonation
until
a
couple
of
seconds
pass
and
a
short
head
forms
still
looks
a
little
tepid
smells
a
bit
of
spiced
malt
but
mostly
of
strong
fruity
ethanol
flavor
is
a
lot
like
the
aroma
dry
malt
with
hints
of
spice
but
then
a
massive
ethanol
attack
very
aggressive
and
lingering
alcohol
distracting
no
sense
of
the
brett
that
the
bottle
says
has
been
added
at
bottling
syrupy
mouthfeel
nah
not
my
favorite
nice
beer
although
i
dont
know
if
aging
it
a
year
improved
it
or
not
may
pick
up
a
2008
and
see
how
that
compares
overall
i
was
slightly
hoping
for
more
of
a
sour
character
so
i
was
slightly
disappointed
though
its
still
a
good
beer
sweetness
was
a
bit
offputting
d
a
very
complex
brew
and
one
i
would
love
to
try
again
somewhat
restrained
but
right
on
for
the
style
imo
this
is
an
excellent
beer
and
lost
abbey
gets
a
lot
of
flavor
out
of
the
yeast
in
this
brew
all
in
all
a
solid
beer
i
was
a
little
intimidated
originally
by
the
fragrances
but
it
pulled
through
i
probably
will
not
buy
this
again
for
a
while
but
was
happy
to
have
tried
it
this
beer
pours
the
color
of
a
light
brown
with
a
huge
white
head
with
good
belgian
lacing
the
aroma
is
very
floral
almost
perfume
like
its
malty
and
not
too
hoppy
the
flavor
is
of
a
light
malt
with
a
little
bit
of
spiciness
to
it
well
balanced
but
the
body
was
substantially
lacking
really
thin
d
a
slight
mess
of
muddled
flavors
that
are
not
helped
by
the
flat
carbonation
d
one
and
done
it
took
me
a
little
over
two
hours
to
finish
this
750
this
is
a
good
candidate
for
sharing
with
the
10
alc
not
my
favorite
la
product
but
im
glad
i
tried
it
the
amount
of
flavors
in
this
brew
may
be
offputting
to
some
though
this
probably
goes
better
with
some
cheeses
drinkability
i
definitely
like
this
and
if
you
like
wild
ales
you
probably
will
too
its
not
the
best
ive
had
but
i
wouldnt
have
a
problem
sipping
this
all
night
d
high
alcohol
delivers
a
buzz
quickly
grill
some
pork
pour
a
bunch
of
bottles
into
a
bowl
add
some
chopped
fruit
and
have
yourself
a
hawaiin
hoppy
lau
lau
for
the
holidays
the
lost
abbey
has
once
again
brewed
a
masterful
subtle
ale
that
is
sublime
in
execution
and
a
joy
to
imbibe
its
not
my
favorite
of
their
line
nor
a
star
in
the
prestigious
bspa
field
but
an
interesting
and
extreme
beer
that
im
glad
i
tried
once
notes
this
is
the
last
bottle
of
lost
abbey
brew
i
had
sitting
around
from
my
days
of
trading
2007
vintage
pours
a
rather
hazy
peach
colour
with
vigorous
head
nose
brett
is
very
noticable
earthiness
from
the
brett
spice
and
sweet
malts
taste
a
lot
going
on
here
various
spices
and
fruits
toasty
malts
funky
dryness
and
touch
of
sourness
medium
to
thick
body
no
notice
of
boozy
hotness
however
a
very
unique
beverage
that
i
think
really
benefited
from
a
year
to
dry
out
and
let
the
brett
work
its
magic
pours
a
dark
auburn
with
a
frothy
tan
head
nothing
pale
about
this
the
head
sticks
around
for
quite
a
while
and
leaves
a
thick
lacing
perfume
aroma
of
pepper
wheat
grass
oranges
minerals
and
funky
wood
fruity
herbal
taste
dried
peaches
more
orange
peel
some
white
pepper
apples
and
caramel
malt
make
up
the
taste
in
the
background
there
is
a
constant
herbmineraloaky
taste
which
i
presume
is
from
the
frankincense
and
myrhh
but
having
never
tried
those
things
on
their
own
i
dont
know
nevertheless
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
drinkability
though
not
my
favorite
of
the
lost
abbey
lineup
its
still
wellrounded
and
reasonably
drinkable
as
it
definitely
hides
its
abv
rather
well
taste
is
smooth
somewhat
watery
caramel
spice
malt
apricot
some
peach
and
citrus
end
is
light
spice
in
the
aftertaste
warm
d
one
bottle
is
plenty
the
high
abv
and
different
tastes
make
this
one
hard
to
want
more
than
one
glad
i
got
to
try
it
and
glad
that
its
sold
here
now
taste
at
the
center
contains
notes
of
tart
apple
pear
and
cherry
these
fruit
flavors
are
backed
by
a
strong
boozyness
and
the
finish
provides
remaining
lingering
tartness
that
makes
the
mouth
pucker
a
while
longer
overall
a
very
different
beer
being
that
its
a
strong
biere
de
garde
almost
replicates
a
lighter
malted
barleywine
excellent
quality
by
the
lost
abbey
d
a
contemplative
and
subtle
brew
that
made
me
sit
and
ponder
the
various
flavors
i
was
experiencing
nuanced
balanced
and
a
welcome
change
for
the
holidays
m
i
swirled
the
hell
out
of
it
releasing
all
of
the
carbonation
but
second
pour
gave
me
a
great
chewy
feel
with
lots
of
bitter
orange
peel
twangs
at
the
back
of
my
palate
interesting
beer
wasnt
expecting
this
much
complexity
out
of
such
a
young
beer
08
vintage
tm
practically
no
carbonation
smooth
but
a
touch
thin
not
as
much
sourness
in
the
taste
mostly
caramel
and
malt
with
some
hearth
clove
spice
fades
to
some
hop
spice
and
a
touch
boozy
on
the
finish
its
drinkable
but
i
feel
this
beer
is
simply
too
young
the
alcohol
totally
sneaks
up
on
you
unfortunately
im
not
tasting
much
more
than
the
alcohol
but
admittedly
it
is
smooth
and
decent
i
love
lost
abbeyport
brewing
definitely
seek
this
beer
out
and
try
to
age
it
if
you
can
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
spiced
rum
cideresque
comes
to
mind
with
a
little
bit
of
abv
being
noticed
in
the
body
mouthfeel
is
heavy
and
flat
i
dont
care
much
for
it
notes
from
122507
yes
appropriate
date
to
pop
this
one
turns
out
this
beer
is
more
of
a
dressed
up
biere
de
guarde
than
a
belgian
strong
pale
ale
as
stated
on
the
back
of
the
bottle
so
things
make
a
bit
more
sense
now
drank
a
whole
750
of
this
in
about
an
hour
so
its
pretty
damn
drinkable
then
10abv
is
well
hidden
and
could
get
you
into
some
trouble
if
not
careful
very
very
good
beer
overall
this
has
aged
well
this
bottle
is
not
nearly
as
good
as
the
samevintage
bottle
i
tasted
12
weeks
ago
but
i
still
like
it
better
than
fresh
all
around
good
to
welcome
in
the
new
president
for
a
second
term
i
would
work
on
it
d
good
drinkability
but
pretty
strong
i
liked
this
a
lot
better
when
i
gave
it
chance
to
warm
up
it
was
too
subtle
when
too
cold
medium
full
body
with
some
warming
from
the
alcohol
more
carbonation
would
aid
in
the
overall
drinkability
of
this
fine
brew
this
is
freshly
bottled
and
more
carbonation
should
come
in
time
ill
let
you
know
in
six
months
when
i
crack
another
gift
open
great
seasonal
offering
that
will
improve
with
age
regardless
cheers
d
pretty
tasty
and
drinkable
if
it
werent
for
the
fact
i
was
at
cbs
and
there
were
lots
of
other
good
things
to
try
i
owe
0110x011
a
big
thanks
for
sending
this
as
a
tif
winners
treat
and
yes
i
did
copy
and
paste
your
name
to
help
me
in
the
long
run
d
the
yeast
clumps
are
unappealing
and
the
ale
is
generally
muddled
not
my
favorite
lost
abbey
offering
drinkability
not
bad
but
not
too
impressive
the
aroma
is
pleasant
but
the
sheer
quantity
of
yeast
rendered
the
appearance
unattractive
and
the
taste
was
a
little
bland
on
the
other
hand
the
mouthfeel
and
aroma
were
very
nice
alcohol
is
a
little
high
and
also
a
little
noticeable
pours
a
deep
copper
orange
with
a
thick
off
white
head
the
aroma
is
medium
sweet
yeasty
floral
citrus
and
light
spices
flavor
is
floral
orange
herbal
pepper
apple
and
light
pepper
medium
to
full
body
smooth
and
creamy
texture
finishes
medium
with
a
citrus
bitterness
pours
to
a
hazy
wheat
honey
gold
color
body
head
is
two
full
fingers
of
rocky
tan
fuzz
that
has
very
nice
retention
nose
is
faint
but
includes
some
crisp
and
slightly
wheaty
sour
feel
smooth
complexity
is
teamed
with
a
grassy
hop
feel
and
a
long
dry
almost
peppery
spice
profile
that
is
very
consistant
i
would
think
that
the
brett
has
not
fully
taken
effect
and
probably
needs
a
little
more
time
to
age
moughfeel
welcomes
the
next
sip
and
tingles
with
spice
nicelyu
drinkable
now
but
would
be
nice
to
see
what
some
age
does
for
this
one
the
label
puts
this
in
the
biere
de
garde
style
here
it
is
a
bspa
either
works
as
neither
works
an
interesting
american
spin
on
a
belgianfrench
style
that
turns
out
to
be
unique
though
not
one
that
thrilled
me
overall
this
is
a
pretty
solid
brew
definitely
a
seasonal
worth
coming
back
to
drinkability
is
not
bad
but
this
one
didnt
do
much
for
me
its
interesting
and
worth
a
try
but
its
a
bit
too
dry
and
bitter
for
my
liking
its
a
good
beer
but
not
a
favorite
for
me
this
bottle
was
obtained
via
a
trade
with
smokingmex
many
thanks
for
the
opportunity
poured
in
to
my
stella
artois
glass
a
cloudy
perhaps
from
the
low
temp
orangered
color
with
a
decent
enough
looking
white
head
that
quickly
faded
in
to
a
lace
crown
first
thing
that
comes
to
mind
with
smell
is
light
stone
fruit
such
as
strawberry
and
raspberry
there
is
also
a
light
presence
of
funk
in
the
smell
which
i
suspect
is
a
result
of
the
addition
of
some
brett
taste
is
sort
of
surprising
to
me
in
that
it
is
much
more
hoppy
than
i
was
expecting
the
brett
adds
a
slight
tartness
along
some
dry
grain
and
fruit
in
the
beginning
mouthfeel
is
medium
drinkability
is
good
but
the
alcohol
presence
makes
itself
known
making
it
a
brew
that
would
be
good
to
share
with
friends
reminds
me
a
bit
of
the
avant
garde
ale
in
some
ways
gotm
is
indeed
a
gift
from
a
brewery
that
i
have
been
gaining
respect
for
with
each
new
tasting
hopefully
it
will
make
it
to
boston
soon
like
some
of
its
counterparts
such
as
serpents
stout
carnevale
and
devotion
more
than
worth
seeking
out
cheers
ive
wanted
to
try
this
one
since
it
came
out
but
since
it
was
bottle
conditioned
with
brett
i
decided
to
sit
on
it
for
a
few
months
to
let
that
do
its
work
i
think
it
could
still
use
a
couple
of
more
months
to
tone
down
the
spices
dthis
is
some
interesting
stuff
my
first
bier
de
garde
ipa
hybrid
very
cool
of
the
lost
abbey
folks
a
most
interesting
brew
very
tasty
the
amount
of
dry
hopping
in
this
threw
me
at
first
but
after
i
got
past
that
this
a
rather
tasty
and
easygoing
offering
from
the
lost
abbey
and
i
nearly
did
a
double
take
when
i
saw
that
this
was
almost
10
abv
as
you
feel
none
of
it
in
the
taste
and
body
good
stuff
as
always
from
tomme
and
company
d
highly
drinkable
despite
this
being
an
extremely
complex
brew
this
has
elements
of
ipa
barleywine
and
belgian
farmhouse
styles
that
seemed
to
blend
together
quite
nicely
bottle
courtesy
of
bu11zeye
poured
a
deep
clear
copper
color
ale
with
a
nice
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
lacing
aroma
of
medium
sweet
belgian
style
malt
with
light
funky
yeast
notes
taste
is
also
onedimensional
with
some
medium
sweet
belgian
style
malt
with
some
light
funky
notes
i
thought
this
was
missing
some
spices
or
some
kind
of
ester
good
carbonation
with
average
body
and
no
apparent
alcohol
i
thought
this
was
ok
but
definitely
not
as
good
as
expected
not
that
it
impacts
my
ratings
but
i
am
starting
to
think
this
brewer
more
hype
then
what
he
actually
deserve
good
to
great
beer
but
the
exceptional
ones
are
fare
and
few
between
not
the
best
from
lost
abbey
but
still
interesting
do
not
know
what
to
style
to
classify
this
under
not
in
a
rush
to
drink
this
again
but
will
probably
try
again
next
year
worth
trying
once
at
least
this
is
a
great
beer
id
love
to
drink
again
in
the
future
this
beer
poured
a
cloudy
brown
with
a
huge
head
great
lacing
the
aroma
is
spicy
floral
malty
sweet
and
overall
very
complex
the
taste
is
herbal
spicy
hoppy
earthy
and
layered
but
balanced
this
ones
on
brett
and
makes
description
a
bit
beyond
words
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
this
is
an
excellent
brew
a
bit
odd
but
something
ill
search
for
again
hazy
medium
orange
pour
with
small
head
smell
was
big
vibrant
hops
somewhat
sweet
and
citrusy
with
a
backdrop
of
something
else
intangible
to
me
taste
was
hopped
very
nicely
but
not
bittered
as
in
an
ipa
tart
fresh
bright
flavor
with
a
hint
of
bretty
funk
that
was
pleasantly
milder
than
expected
nice
body
and
bubbly
mouthfeel
very
nice
overall
delicious
and
i
love
it
and
ill
definitely
buy
it
again
when
i
can
but
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
exactly
why
ahhh
hell
who
needs
to
know
for
sure
poured
into
a
rapscallion
glass
formed
a
34
ecru
head
over
the
cloudy
medium
amber
brew
fluffy
head
lasts
well
with
delicate
sporadic
lace
aroma
is
fruity
spicy
but
also
has
an
old
grassy
hops
sort
of
character
to
it
taste
follows
along
but
without
what
i
perceived
as
the
detracting
part
of
the
aroma
alcohol
warmth
at
the
close
small
bubbles
make
the
mouthfeel
excellent
and
drinkability
is
quite
nice
as
well
some
holiday
brews
out
there
could
learn
something
from
this
brew
in
regards
to
not
overspicing
another
nice
one
surprisingly
light
for
lost
abbey
d
this
is
reall
really
good
my
favorite
offering
from
tla
to
date
everything
comes
together
really
well
the
flavor
is
pretty
bold
even
for
the
style
but
its
not
overpowering
or
tough
to
drink
i
do
think
this
could
use
to
age
a
little
longer
as
its
still
a
bit
rough
around
the
edges
and
i
think
the
brett
hadnt
really
permeated
the
flavor
yet
not
a
sessionable
beer
i
felt
the
alcohol
from
the
first
sip
bottom
linei
really
like
biere
de
garde
anyway
but
taking
and
making
it
into
this
is
a
really
nice
peice
of
work
highly
recommend
if
you
can
get
your
hands
on
it
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
medium
body
with
a
slight
creamy
feel
very
enjoyable
man
this
is
a
damn
tasty
treat
wow
so
thick
and
creamy
with
huge
caramel
bursts
banana
clove
and
flowery
finishings
a
slight
bitterness
on
the
finish
and
minimal
residual
sugar
again
light
spices
with
more
of
a
teroir
type
feel
that
only
lost
abbey
could
accomplish
cant
get
over
the
creamy
thick
caramel
middle
damn
this
is
fine
there
is
a
bit
of
alcohol
in
the
chest
but
this
is
so
tasty
it
gets
a
pass
overall
i
thought
this
was
fantastic
really
one
of
the
best
i
have
had
and
another
rare
gem
from
lost
abbey
i
just
do
not
know
what
it
is
with
them
its
like
they
cannot
lose
every
beer
they
make
seems
to
be
better
then
the
one
before
that
this
was
one
of
the
finest
drinks
i
have
ever
had
and
i
look
forward
to
having
another
mild
piney
and
subtly
fruity
aroma
cloudy
orangeamber
color
somewhat
cloudy
with
a
fair
amount
of
sediment
nice
offwhite
head
with
good
retention
some
bitterness
fairly
spicy
with
an
astrigency
that
suggests
more
spice
than
i
actually
tasted
detected
some
notes
of
candied
fruit
fruitcake
slightly
reminiscent
of
orval
poured
into
a
chalice
a
dark
golden
orangereddish
color
very
nice
carbonation
nice
onefinger
creamy
offwhite
head
which
leaves
a
nice
thick
blob
in
the
middle
of
the
glass
and
some
sticky
lacing
around
the
edges
the
nose
is
malty
some
nice
yeast
strain
spicy

and
slight

the
taste

very
nice
tangyness
nice
touch
of

and
some
caramel
the
finish
is
bittertangydry
medium
body
very
drinkable
this
is
a
very
tasty
bspa
highly
recommended
another
awesome
brew
from
the
lost
abbey
thanks
bill
d
the
alcohol
is
a
little
apparent
in
this
ale
i
doubt
i
could
polish
off
an
entire
750ml
unless
i
was
eating
i
believe
my
initial
comment
was
damn
this
would
go
great
with
some
jerk
chicken
wings
the
spicing
here
definitely
contribute
a
sharp
perfume
like
character
to
this
brew
especially
in
the
flavor
this
is
not
surprising
as
i
think
both
frankincense
and
myrrh
arewere
used
in
that
sort
of
application
it
is
hard
to
get
a
sense
if
the
brett
has
kicked
in
yet
with
the
ample
carbonation
i
might
have
guessed
so
but
the
spice
notes
are
still
to
fresh
to
really
tell
yet
this
really
needs
quite
a
bit
of
age
on
it
before
it
comes
any
where
close
to
peaking
ill
be
trying
this
in
a
year
or
so
but
it
may
actually
need
a
couple
to
really
take
off
as
i
noted
above
this
beer
would
be
much
better
if
not
for
the
awkward
finish
i
do
think
some
aging
would
do
this
beer
a
lot
of
good
i
can
see
it
developing
quite
well
with
the
harsh
alcohol
on
the
finish
diminishing
over
time
well
worth
a
try
and
will
certainly
get
better
with
age
notes
a
good
brew
on
the
spicey
end
of
the
belgian
pale
style
and
fairly
dry
as
well
price
per
value
ehhh
1
bottle
a
year
and
ill
be
just
fine
14
750ml
bottle
from
southbay
drugs
nice
orange
color
with
an
initially
huge
white
head
and
then
nothing
the
first
glass
was
clear
but
they
got
murkier
as
the
bottle
was
consumed
smells
sour
at
first
and
then
sweet
the
flavors
are
myriad
and
i
couldnt
pick
them
out
individually
at
first
my
friend
commented
on
how
complex
the
flavor
was
at
first
it
was
so
peppery
and
it
washed
over
the
tongue
with
a
tanginess
then
slight
fruity
flavors
i
briefly
tasted
the
funky
barnyard
haytype
flavor
and
alcohol
comes
and
goes
while
i
am
not
sure
it
is
worth
the
price
tag
this
was
a
very
interesting
and
unique
offering
ill
be
looking
forward
to
the
next
lost
abbey
beer
from
the
cellar
d
so
delicious
lost
abbey
never
dissapoints
i
love
the
complexity
of
all
their
beers
i
have
sampled
and
im
excited
to
be
a
patron
saint
this
year
im
on
my
second
pour
now
and
as
i
expected
the
appearance
has
turned
totally
cloudy
man
the
brett
is
just
ruling
it
now
so
me
being
a
fan
the
drinkability
factor
just
crept
up
a
notch
great
sipping
ale
indeed
id
buy
it
again
caramel
colored
with
an
offwhite
head
with
excellent
retention
and
lacing
somewhat
funky
aroma
i
swear
i
get
a
small
amount
of
resinous
hops
too
earthy
hay
maybe
a
touch
of
funk
but
i
still
get
more
of
the
resinous
hops
in
here
i
think
i
get
some
tastes
of
lemon
and
oats
too
if
that
makes
sense
medium
bodied
with
a
dryish
hoppy
finish
higher
than
medium
carbonation
a
rather
different
beer
but
still
quite
good
poured
out
of
750ml
bottle
corked
and
caged
bought
from
lost
abbey
poured
into
my
duvel
snifter
poured
a
golden
copperish
orange
color
with
nice
thick
foamy
head
that
retained
for
a
long
time
smell
is
of
cinnamon
honey
a
slight
resinous
herbal
scent
taste
is
a
citrus
hoppy
biere
de
garde
with
semi
sweet
dryish
musty
earth
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
the
alcohol
while
present
is
very
subtle
and
balance
nicely
by
the
malt
and
hop
profile
i
am
sure
this
beer
will
improve
when
the
brett
flavor
and
aromas
develope
with
a
little
time
drinkability
a
sipper
there
are
some
overwhelming
flavors
in
this
that
would
keep
one
from
drinking
too
quickly
d
drinkable
now
no
doubt
given
a
few
months
of
contemplation
in
the
bottle
this
could
be
a
truly
magical
gift
a
pleasing
slow
sipper
this
winter
evening
one
id
certainly
seek
out
again
though
next
time
getting
an
extra
to
see
what
a
bit
of
age
might
do
d
at
the
first
sip
i
was
kind
of
weary
about
it
drinking
more
and
more
of
it
it
really
pulls
you
in
to
the
interesting
complexity
and
variety
of
flavors
this
beer
offers
i
plan
to
sit
on
my
other
bottle
for
about
612
months
to
see
what
its
like
when
the
bretta
kicks
in
i
can
see
that
making
this
into
a
completely
different
beer
like
the
10
commandments
d
its
a
good
beer
but
in
the
end
i
wasnt
as
in
to
it
as
i
thought
i
would
be
after
the
hype
definitely
worth
a
try
though
drinkability
would
really
like
to
try
this
one
again
was
in
a
hurry
and
really
didnt
get
the
full
effect
and
didnt
quite
get
to
enjoy
it
as
much
as
i
wanted
too
as
it
it
was
tasty
and
quite
different
from
any
other
beer
ive
had
very
odd
spicy
flavors
that
melded
pretty
well
this
is
definitely
worth
a
try
if
you
can
find
it
another
fine
brew
from
lost
abbey
a
patron
saint
was
kind
enough
to
purchase
this
for
me
at
last
fridays
nov
23
older
viscosity
bottle
release
this
magis
label
states
it
was
bottle
conditioned
with
brettanomyces
pours
cloudy
blood
orange
with
a
white
head
that
had
orange
globs
in
it
aroma
is
mostly
dry
with
black
pepper
fresh
hops
and
barnyard
has
a
dry
chalky
mouthfeel
musty
dry
flavors
at
first
of
bready
malts
yeast
and
tart
lemon
giving
way
to
a
light
sweetness
and
mild
boozyness
to
finish
a
fairly
complex
brew
here
wish
i
had
a
bottle
to
age
it
will
be
a
dessert
in
another
year
definitely
on
the
sweeter
side
all
in
all
not
very
good
huge
carbonation
hiss
as
the
bottle
opens
pours
90
foam
even
at
a
45
degree
angle
settles
as
a
pale
orange
hue
with
very
good
transparency
huge
foamy
offwhite
head
on
top
aroma
is
of
lemons
hints
of
bretty
funk
some
tree
fruits
nice
toasted
caramel
malt
presence
in
there
as
well
interesting
flavors
of
lemon
coriander
earthy
hay
hints
of
tart
fruit
toasted
malts
maybe
a
touch
over
carbonated
but
the
feel
is
still
nice
i
like
this
beer
more
than
i
thought
i
would
pretty
good
beer
overall
glad
i
found
this
in
the
3
99
bargin
bin
im
not
exactly
sure
but
pretty
sure
this
is
a
few
years
old
an
interesting
beer
for
sure
the
mouthfeel
threw
it
off
a
little
for
me
im
not
a
fan
of
swallowing
straight
foam
great
aroma
the
funk
is
delicate
without
being
light
very
earthy
with
notes
of
sourdough
bread
and
tropical
fruit
overall
a
beer
thats
decent
but
nothing
spectacular
as
much
as
i
love
saisons
ive
had
trouble
finding
a
biere
de
garde
that
speaks
to
me
in
the
same
way
this
one
is
unique
in
having
the
brett
and
some
tartness
but
those
elements
are
too
subdued
to
really
kick
this
one
up
a
notch
this
isnt
something
i
would
necessarily
seek
out
however
this
one
aged
in
my
cellar
for
two
years
i
would
like
another
bottle
to
see
how
it
would
end
up
after
4
years
in
the
cellar
draught
at
the
flying
saucer
in
raleigh
pours
an
extremely
cloudy
amber
color
with
a
smallish
pillowy
white
head
they
said
it
was
near
the
end
of
the
keg
so
it
may
look
a
bit
weird
nose
is
subtle
but
slightly
malty
taste
is
light
and
slightly
sweet
but
without
a
lot
of
substance
to
it
meh
cheers
o
not
world
class
but
quite
enjoyable

pours
a

golden
color
with
a
nice
large
frothy
head
there
is
a
very
strong
yeasty
aroma
with
hints
of
spices
and
oranges
the
taste
has
some
notes
of
orange
then
it
becomes
sour
very
yeasty
and
thick
the
flavor
is
full
but
i
dont
want
this
flavor
hanging
around
overall
i
didnt
care
for
this
it
does
have
a
full
flavor
but
too
thick
in
taste
overall
what
a
weird
beer
on
paper
i
should
not
like
its
flavor
but
in
practice
it
just
rings
my
bell
the
mouthfeel
alone
is
almost
reason
enough
to
have
this
beer
again

very

and
easy

i
enjoyed
this
one
a
lot
one
of
the
better
biere
de

i
have
had
this
is
my
first
biere
de
garde
so
i
couldnt
say
how
this
one
rates
within
the
style
the
style
itself
sounds
like
what
i
want
so
i
hope
to
find
other
good
ones
overall
3
5
in
the
end
this
is
a
pretty
tame
and
easygoing
beer
not
super
bretty
not
super
spicy
not
super
sweet
not
super
anything
its
a
shame
that
this
was
pasteurized
before
packaging
because
i
think
brett
conditioning
would
have
done
very
nice
things
with
the
malt
body
and
everything
else
in
this
beer
next
time
it
comes
out
id
really
like
to
try
it
fresh
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
bright
yellow
color
with
a
fizzy
white
head
on
top
the
retention
was
decent
but
the
lacing
was
minimal
the
smell
of
the
beer
gives
off
so
light
sour
notes
as
well
as
some
fresh
lemon
and
grains
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
sweet
upfront
with
a
subtle
sourness
in
the
finish
with
some
additional
citrus
flavors
the
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
highly
carbonated
and
dry
overall
its
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
was
glad
i
tried
it
not
something
i
need
to
seek
out
again
though
o
a
very
enjoyable
tart
brettanomyces
and
spice
focused
beer
if
you
took
away
some
of
the
malt
youd
have
a
spiced
saison
d
the
aroma
is
more
powerful
than
the
flavor
but
both
are
quite
interesting
a
nice
balance
of
spice
fruit
and
rich
malt
overall
this
one
is
complex
but
at
the
same
time
a
little
bland
the
flavors
are
many
but
they
all
kind
of
run
together
drinkable
with
nothing
offputting
o
again
i
dont
have
a
huge
base
of
knowledge
about
this
style
just
kinda
going
off
what
ba
says
about
it
but
from
what
i
can
tell
this
beer
is
pretty
good
for
the
style
a
surprisingly
tasty
wellexecuted
offering
from
a
typically
soso
bigtime
brewery
this
one
pours
a
light
orange
color
pretty
nice
head
notes
of
citrus
and
coriander
dominate
among
a
breadiness
and
saisonlike
undertones
lightbodied
for
exceptional
drinkability
but
still
a
complex
beer
thats
probably
the
best
of
their
lof
series
as
far
as
the
3
ive
tried
o
lots
of
interesting
things
going
on
here
i
personally
would
not
grab
this
off
the
shelf
again
while
the
style
may
dictate
as
such
the
complexity
is
a
bit
overwhelming
thus
removing
any
ability
to
savor
this
beer
o
reminds
me
a
bit
of
the
vrienden
lips
of
faith
that
nb
did
with
allagash
and
i
wasnt
a
fan
of
that
lof
are
very
hit
or
miss
with
me
and
this
was
a
miss
very
refreshing
feel
the
carbonation
is
kept
down
where
it
should
be
and
the
tartness
plays
across
the
back
of
the
palate
nicely
not
as
funky
or
as
tart
as
id
like
from
this
release
but
a
damn
fine
beer
to
savor
and
finish
overall
a
pretty
drinkable
brew
but
nothing
too
exciting
typical
brett
funk
which
is
downplayed
by
the
addition
of
the
lemoncitrus
notes
and
the
high
level
of
carbonation
a
good
example
of
the
style
but
not
one
i
would
seek
out
again
o
a
good
solid
beer
with
good
flavor
and
some
nice
complexity
should
go
well
with
some
football
and
nachos
a
really
nice
beer
22oz
is
plenty
for
one
sitting
but
i
would
buy
it
again
recommended
o
a
tough
one
for
me
great
example
of
the
style
but
i
think
if
i
aged
it
more
that
familiar
horse
blanketbarn
yard
aroma
would
come
out
even
more
and
that
brett
yeast
would
do
even
more
im
going
to
buy
another
and
cellar
it
then
maybe
revisit
this
review
well
i
thought
this
was
a
pretty
darn
good
farmhouse
ale
i
dont
know
enough
to
really
distinguish
this
from
a
saison
but
it
was
spot
on
for
that
style
solid
across
the
board
but
it
didnt
have
enough
unique
character
to
distinguish
it
from
some
outstanding
examples
of
the
style
still
very
solid
i
have
been
enjoying
my
way
through
a
bunch
of
the
lips
of
faith
series
and
this
was
quite
a
surprise
i
had
passed
this
one
many
times
in
favor
of
tart
lychee
and
cocoa
mole
but
im
glad
i
finally
picked
this
one
up
lighter
body
with
lively
carbonation
alcohol
is
hidden
well
not
as
complex
as
i
hoped
for
or
thought
from
the
aroma
o
not
terrible
but
i
would
rather
spend
a
lot
more
on
a
bottle
of
la
folie
and
im
a
cheap
bastard
which
should
tell
you
something
even
though
its
wellmade
i
dont
think
i
would
ever
buy
it
again
amber
hued
orange
ale
with
solid
cream
foam
pretty
smells
of
sweet
grains
and
some
hints
of
hay
a
hint
of
cream
flavor
is
lighter
malts
some
herbal
hops
which
are
subdued
and
a
slight
sharpness
like
there
is
a
hint
of
lacto
or
something
tasty
the
flavor
is
pretty
light
and
easy
overall
for
drinking
on
a
hot
day
medium
on
full
bodied
almost
like
an
amber
to
me
with
moderately
hi
carb
decent
beer
maybe
a
little
too
subtle
for
my
taster
to
appreciate
o
seems
to
be
a
good
example
of
the
style
a
good
introductory
beer
poured
from
22oz
into
tulip
pours
a
great
copper
color
nice
thick
foamy
head
and
sticky
lacing
very
malty
and
fresh
yeast
aroma
with
hints
of
spice
taste
is
very
crisp
malts
a
bit
of
warming
spice
like
cinnamon
or
allspice
with
a
touch
of
fresh
yeast
a
bit
dry
mouthfeel
but
still
crisp
this
if
my
first
of
the
style
and
its
quite
intersting
and
good
cant
compare
to
another
but
i
do
like
it
it
has
alot
of
intersting
characteristics
and
i
wouldnt
hesitate
to
have
again
a
rare
style
you
dont
see
around
too
often
but
lets
give
it
a
try
medium
bodied
very
tart
taste
kind
of
hard
to
describe
some
honey
and
funkiness
maybe
some
apples
in
there
bit
of
an
odd
finish
too
i
know
its
a
different
style
but
it
just
seemed
to
be
kind
of
a
mess
and
didnt
work
too
well
for
me
appreciate
them
trying
something
new
but
too
unbalanced
for
my
liking
this
is
a
pretty
solid
beer
and
very
unique
never
had
a
beer
this
floral
i
think
they
could
try
adding
a
heavier
malt
backbone
to
balance
it
out
a
bit
but
this
doing
the
job
on
a
rainy
spring
day
as
is
o
decent
unsure
if
its
something
id
return
to
but
its
definitely
an
easy
drink
o
a
good
beer
from
the
lips
of
faith
series
but
new
belgium
does
have
better
ones
at
8
dollars
for
a
bomber
it
might
be
a
tad
overpriced
this
is
good
just
not
great
this
is
a
unique
beer
that
is
reasonably
priced
and
readily
available
overall
im
not
overly
impressed
its
a
nice
light
ale
with
some
promise
but
it
lacks
depth
easy
enough
to
sip
and
would
fit
a
warm
spring
day
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
it
ontap
at
the
brewery
hazed
rusty
orange
with
an
elegant
dollop
of
white
foam
sitting
on
top
great
balance
toasty
and
grainy
with
an
impression
of
sourdough
bread
bitterness
is
mild
and
flavors
of
flowers
lavender
dirt
and
black
pepper
liven
things
up
clean
on
the
swallow
with
perfect
dryness
for
the
style
overall
this
was
a
nice
beer
to
drink
but
definitely
not
worth
the
price
great
dessert
beer
as
it
is
dominated
with
spices
and
sweetness
d
this
was
not
a
terribly
exciting
beer
but
fitting
scent
and
taste
and
body
for
the
style
mellow
character
with
very
smooth
finish
so
quite
easy
to
drink
nice
to
try
but
nothing
special
o
good
beer
not
great
i
just
found
the
taste
bland
and
too
earthy
notes
a
bit
too
generic
or
soft
for
a
brett
brew
i
guess
but
this
might
be
a
good
entry
point
to
some
funk
good
brew
in
any
case
even
if
a
tad
unremarkable
overall
a
really
easy
to
drink
beer
with
subdued
spicing
a
soft
mouthfeel
and
quick
finish
i
enjoyed
this
quite
a
bit
for
3
for
13
oz
pour
that
i
got
at
hh
but
dont
think
it
would
be
a
great
value
for
57
for
a
22oz
bottle
off
the
shelf
kinda
torn
here
the
brew
is
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
but
ive
already
forgotten
about
it
and
thats
not
what
im
looking
for
from
the
style
let
alone
the
lips
a
faith
series
i
had
jolly
pumpkins
oro
de
calabaza
recently
so
my
expectations
are
a
bit
skewed
overall
a
great
seasonal
beer
it
is
crisp
refreshing
and
unique
i
would
never
drink
it
year
rounds
but
it
is
a
nice
way
to
kick
of
the
summer
d
a
tale
of
two
beers
excellent
appearance
and
aroma
disappointing
taste
and
mouthfeel
the
end
result
is
a
so
so
beer
that
ill
neither
seek
ouit
again
nor
recommend
its
a
shame
because
this
one
had
lots
of
potential
o
decent
not
exactly
what
i
was
expecting
this
definitely
isnt
overly
funky
or
bretted
out
pretty
balanced
couldnt
drink
a
lot
of
this
o
my
first
biere
de
garde
i
really
enjoyed
it
easy
to
drink
but
has
nice
complexity
like
new
belgium
often
does
it
encourages
you
to
go
seek
out
more
of
a
style
o
i
like
this
style
jolly
pumpkin
and
ommegang
being
my
favorites
but
this
one
puts
a
nice
spin
on
it
with
the
citrus
well
put
together
and
very
enjoyable
o
i
enjoy
this
one
just
as
much
as
i
initially
thought
when
i
first
heard
of
them
releasing
it
im
glad
i
got
the
ba
lowered
expectations
before
i
had
this
i
didnt
expect
much
after
reading
the
reviews
highly
recommended
and
so
far
the
best
biere
de
garde
ive
had
d
very
drinkable
nicely
balanced
with
a
good
balance
of
tart
and
sour
flavors
on
tap
at
slaters
5050
in
san
diego
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
but
a
week
from
now
i
doubt
ill
remember
much
about
it
overall
a
very
good
beer
understated
in
its
complexity
with
a
nice
use
of
spices
and
a
pleasent
malt
presence
i
just
with
the
brett
character
were
a
bit
more
upfront
cheers

of
funk
some
bread
malts
and
a
little
citrus
overall
at
first
i
was
on
the
fence
with
this
beer
as
i
thought
it
was
too
sweet
without
enough
brett
and
herbal
complexity
the
more
i
tasted
it
however
i
started
to
come
around
and
i
am
enjoying
the
range
of
flavors
even
though
i
would
still
prefer
it
to
be
less
sweet
and
im
pretty
sure
the
bottle
said
something
about
having
brett
but
you
really
wouldnt
know
it
if
you
drank
this
beer
fresh
it
was
so
meh
for
me
i
wont
be
aging
it
to
find
out
if
it
improves
because
it
doesnt
seem
to
have
a
high
ceiling
potential
given
that
the
most
brett
the
bottle
seemed
to
have
was
on
the
outside
paint
label
totally
enjoyable
o
its
an
ok
beer
first
of
the
style
that
i
have
had
so
maybe
im
just
not
a
fan
of
it
we
will
see
o
decent
beer
would
order
out
if
i
were
at
as
restaurant
kinda
mellow
and
unique
tasting
overall
impression
an
interesting
biere
de
garde
but
didnt
quite
satisfy
what
i
was
wanting
to
find
in
this
style
not
one
of
the
top
lips
of
faith
beers
either
the
appearance
was
great
but
then
went
down
hill
from
there
wouldnt
go
back
to
again
poured
from
bomber
to
duvel
tulip
the
beer
pours
a
amber
orange
color
with
a
fair
amount
of
sediment
the
head
is
a
nice
1
finger
white
cream
colored
head
good
retention
and
lacing
the
nose
seems
muted
not
much
at
all
a
slight
caramel
malt
flavor
with
hints
of
clean
yeast
the
flavor
is
more
pronounced
than
the
nose
lets
on
but
not
by
much
starts
with
a
bready
malt
character
from
which
the
caramel
sweetness
builds
hints
of
honey
mildly
bitter
finishes
crisp
with
a
lingering
sweetness
lighter
bodied
and
well
carbonated
perhaps
too
much
so
overall
its
a
decent
beer
but
one
that
i
wont
return
to
likely
do
mostly
boring
it
tastes
like
fat
tire
with
an
additional
spice
contribution
its
bland
texture
does
nothing
to
elevate
the
experience
while
the
smell
detracts
in
its
resemblance
to
a
forgotten
dishrag
compared
to
jenlain
biere
de
printemps
it
is
cleaner
but
far
less
interesting
underwhelming
and
forgettable
it
makes
one
wonder
why
this
beer
is
occupying
an
exclusive
space
in
the
biennial
lips
of
faith
lineup
overall
an
unimpressive
beer
no
off
flavors
but
nothing
to
get
excited
about
either
to
much
biscuit
not
enough
of
everything
else
will
avoid
this
one
in
the
future
even
though
its
not
bad
nice
complexity
but
a
little
light
o
i
believe
that
this
one
is
the
victim
of
meandering
in
blahville
while
this
was
neither
pleasing
nor
offending
imo
ive
already
forgotten
that
i
drank
it
o
pleasant
flavors
but
a
bit
sweet
for
my
tastes
pours
a
dark
orange
with
an
amber
hue
nice
creamy
colored
head
that
pours
out
eventually
drops
down
and
forms
a
thickish
coating
around
the
edges
nice
lacing
a
mild
funkiness
its
there
but
subtle
done
well
paired
with
some
sweet
orange
very
nice
flavor
caught
me
off
guard
it
popped
in
my
mouth
a
lot
more
than
i
expected
it
to
some
mild
funk
introduces
intself
before
a
wave
of
sweetness
comes
in
from
a
dose
of
caramel
malt
and
fruits
some
pear
some
banana
something
citric
coriander
is
there
too
and
the
funkiness
does
maintain
its
presence
throughout
and
then
some
and
in
a
less
than
positive
way
the
funk
does
evolve
into
being
a
little
too
much
medium
bodied
creamy
and
carbonated
a
bit
dry
in
the
finish
nice
beer
at
a
nice
price
this
one
was
just
okay
i
expected
better
o
a
fun
beer
i
really
like
the
lemon
and
what
i
presume
is
the
lemon
verbena
flavors
along
with
a
restrained
brett
flavor
o
nice
beer
in
an
unusual
style
easy
to
drink
and
an
interesting
restrained
use
of
brett
d
drinks
a
lot
easier
than
the
abv
would
suggest
almost
a
little
too
light
i
like
a
bit
more
meat
on
my
bdgs
otherwise
good
flavor
and
the
touch
of
brett
on
the
nose
is
nice
the
beer
is
light
in
body
and
carbonation
and
finishes
dry
incredibly
drinkable
for
what
it
is
overall
i
love
this
beer
excellent
effort
by
new
belgium
to
do
something
that
isnt
quite
mainstream
overall
maybe
if
i
hadnt
checked
the
new
belgium
web
site
would
of
thought
more
of
this
one
sadly
saw
brett
and
was
expecting
sour
goodness
overall
brett
just
to
light
not
funky
or
tart
enough
so
overall
not
great
biere
de
garde
or
a
great
brett
brew
t
very
smooth
and
east
drinking
light
pale
malt
coriander
and
a
slight
hint
of
hops
before
a
drawn
out
finish
full
of
earthy
yeast
a
hint
of
funk
and
some
bread
the
finish
was
a
bit
much
for
me
and
the
yeast
took
the
flavor
over
a
bit
too
much
a
nice
beer
but
probably
not
one
ill
revisit
this
is
a
little
underwhelming
overall
the
flavor
is
enjoyable
but
not
overly
impressive
i
probably
wont
have
this
again
o
pretty
good
one
of
those
beers
that
would
go
nicely
with
all
4
seasons
simple
but
well
balanced
and
easy
to
drink
ill
have
another
a
bit
disappointed
compared
to
some
of
the
other
lips
of
faith
offerings
overall
a
good
offering
thats
refreshing
and
enjoyable
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
some
of
the
more
prevalent
styles
pours
a
slightly
hazy
honey
orange
with
a
beige
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
tiny
dots
of
lace
form
on
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
citrusy
with
some
spices
and
a
slight
sourfunky
aroma
taste
is
pretty
much
the
same
with
some
grainmalt
flavors
too
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
with
some
nice
fruit
and
funk
aromas
and
flavors
overall
this
is
a
great
way
to
present
a
quenching
beer
for
the
warmer
months
every
other
summer
style
has
been
overplayed
without
noticing
this
underplayed
style
good
job
new
belgium
overall
a
decent
brew
the
brett
seems
a
bit
disjointed
from
the
rest
of
the
beer
and
makes
it
a
bit
one
dimensional
overall
i
cant
really
hate
a
lot
on
this
brew
but
it
is
rather
unmemorable
i
feel
like
farmhouse
brews
can
be
some
of
the
most
interesting
and
complexly
flavored
beers
out
there
and
this
one
is
supremely
hohum
curious
brew
here
very
different
pours
a
surprisingly
clear
or
should
i
say
not
too
hazy
orange
golden
color
with
a
nice
but
quickly
fading
head
bone
white
smells
more
malty
than
it
is
with
some
citrus
notes
flavor
is
very
orangey
not
just
the
bitter
peel
but
the
sweet
acidic
fruit
itself
mild
nuanced
brett
quality
in
the
finish
but
no
overpowering
sour
here
its
like
a
candy
that
isnt
really
sweet
mouthfeel
is
nice
too
very
lively
with
a
lighter
body
very
drinkable
and
reasonably
priced
at
6
bucks
a
bomber
another
nice
new
belgium
brew
o
worth
drinking
a
little
onedimensional
with
the
brett
o
elegant
hippie
brew
farmy
time
did
this
brew
well
recommended
cheers
overallthis
beer
is
pretty
good
it
was
refreshing
cold
and
a
little
more
complex
as
it
warms
still
tough
to
review
a
beer
that
ive
never
had
before
but
id
say
purchase
this
beer
if
you
can
o
a
good
effort
from
new
belgium
but
it
could
use
more
definition
in
the
flavor
the
nose
offers
much
more
so
in
the
end
this
comes
across
as
a
lemon
citric
and
brett
yeast
centric
brew
that
wants
to
call
itself
a
biere
de
garde
but
is
secretly
a
really
nice
belgian
golden
ale
i
wish
it
were
classified
as
such
so
that
i
could
give
it
the
good
score
it
deserves
but
as
a
biere
de
garde
not
quite
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
very
different
and
interesting
beer
i
liked
it
enough
but
i
dont
know
that
all
the
flavors
worked
together
for
me
overall
i
was
amazed
by
how
well
put
together
this
one
was
really
just
a
great
well
balanced
beer
that
would
be
a
good
starting
point
for
someone
looking
to
get
into
sours
sad
to
see
this
beer
only
have
a
b
because
i
am
loving
it
granted
this
is
not
as
intense
as
most
other
sours
the
balance
and
flavor
is
perfect
for
me
it
poured
a
great
golden
hue
with
a
one
finger
lingering
head
and
the
aromas
are
outstandingly
citrusy
the
flavor
itself
is
just
a
tad
sour
with
a
good
malty
complexity
this
combined
with
its
citrus
overtones
reminds
me
a
lot
of
goose
islands
sofie
with
the
same
easy
drinkability
a
long
time
favorite
of
mine
i
am
in
love
with
this
beer
and
hope
to
convert
many
more
to
its
mild
sour
approach
da
very
drinkable
beer
however
this
is
a
mildly
flavored
american
wild
a
good
gateway
beer
for
those
who
havent
had
sours
but
for
those
that
love
and
adore
sours
this
one
is
a
little
bland
body
thin
and
smooth
very
easy
to
drink
with
a
flavor
that
is
intriguing
enough
to
want
one
or
more
the
best
thing
going
for
this
is
you
could
use
the
bottle
for
a
weapon
after
your
done
pouring
it
down
the
drain
new
belgium
owes
me
some
money
opinion
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
i
think
that
it
is
a
bit
much
just
using
brettanomyces
on
this
beer
if
that
was
what
they
did
that
character
is
a
bit
much
as
the
beer
starts
to
warm
up
i
would
prefer
that
there
be
some
other
wild
character
in
there
to
back
it
up
or
less
brett
something
as
it
is
this
beer
becomes
somewhat
onedimensional
in
the
brett
as
it
warms
so
it
takes
away
from
the
rest
of
the
blend
all
this
said
this
is
a
very
good
beer
and
the
fact
that
i
am
scrutinizing
to
this
degree
means
that
it
is
a
quality
product
i
just
doubt
that
i
will
be
drinking
it
much
as
it
is
a
bit
out
of
balance
because
of
the
yeast
overall
a
pretty
tasty
beer
but
not
necessarily
something
i
would
go
gaga
over
or
anything
very
drinkable
though
moderately
light
abv
and
flavors
that
dont
necessarily
overwhelm
the
palate
its
not
to
be
overlooked
but
not
to
be
blown
out
of
proportion
this
is
certainly
not
a
bad
beer
but
it
is
not
as
good
as
some
of
the
other
lips
of
faith
beers
it
has
some
interesting
funk
but
it
kind
of
falls
flat
because
the
taste
is
too
weak
its
not
watery
though
and
i
guess
it
would
be
good
in
the
summer
the
cpj
d
definite
late
summer
early
fall
beer
refreshing
cold
with
a
sour
flash
but
with
enough
muted
complexity
to
bring
in
the
colder
months
the
yeast
seems
to
shift
what
would
otherwise
be
a
citrus
farmhouse
style
ale
to
something
with
more
depth
that
doesnt
have
its
head
in
the
clouds
i
think
nb
accomplished
what
it
set
out
to
brew
with
this
one
d
very
drinkable
abv
is
manageable
not
at
all
filling
in
contrast
to
the
carbonation
this
may
color
the
following
but
i
honestly
dont
know
what
makes
this
a
wild
ale
just
sayin
it
pours
a
slightly
hazy
straw
topped
by
a
finger
of
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
wheat
grass
lemon
zest
and
a
light
farmy
funk
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
proportionately
more
wheat
and
greens
than
before
a
pinch
of
cardamom
may
or
may
not
be
in
there
as
well
well
never
know
for
sure
the
body
is
a
very
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
drying
finish
overall
a
nice
saisonesque
brew
not
much
wildness
going
on
but
pretty
good
beyond
that
very
drinkable
md
light
to
medium
bodied
with
decent
carbonation
overall
the
flavor
is
really
nice
the
strawberrybanana
flavor
caught
me
completely
off
guard
but
i
really
liked
it
i
had
this
at
a
tasting
with
a
couple
other
bas
it
poured
a
light
copper
very
thin
in
body
with
a
light
white
head
the
smell
was
very
floral
like
hibiscus
but
not
in
a
hoppy
way
whatsoever
it
also
had
a
lot
of
sourness
to
it
and
was
kind
of
bitter
the
flavors
werent
impressive
at
all
it
had
sourness
to
it
but
not
in
the
appealing
fashion
it
was
pretty
one
dimensional
this
beer
drank
far
too
thin
and
was
kind
of
typical
of
new
belgium
i
didnt
care
for
this
and
wouldnt
recommend
it
slightly
cloudy
golden
amber
with
a
short
lived
white
head
bready
and
citrusy
with
coriander
and
lemon
notes
shining
through
very
interesting
and
the
sourness
is
present
although
not
prominent
yeasty
breadiness
is
apparent
throughout
i
detect
a
deep
earthy
and
somewhat
musty
background
that
carries
the
fresher
nuances
very
well
light
body
and
crisp
carbonation
drinks
very
nicely
and
would
do
well
with
gorgonzola
or
roquefort
cheese
its
hard
to
give
this
beer
average
scores
because
its
good
but
just
not
good
for
the
style
or
for
the
brewery
a
decent
wild
ale
to
try
once
but
not
worth
seeking
out
conclusion
i
like
this
beer
quite
a
bit
but
i
can
see
how
it
probably
draws
criticism
for
not
being
funky
and
sour
enough
this
is
certainly
a
wild
ale
but
not
one
that
will
cause
you
to
pucker
your
lips
i
believe
this
style
is
a
rather
broad
one
and
because
of
that
there
is
plenty
of
room
for
a
beer
like
this
well
done
new
belgium
d
there
was
just
something
off
in
the
smell
and
taste
to
me
not
infected
or
anything
i
just
didnt
feel
that
the
mixture
or
smells
and
tastes
worked
well
together
wouldnt
seek
out
again
overall
a
yeastdriven
ale
with
high
drinkability
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
with
medium
body
the
beer
feels
a
bit
heavier
than
it
really
is
because
it
doesnt
have
a
ton
of
carb
the
beer
isdecent
but
not
too
flavorful
its
really
nothing
special
i
like
the
jolly
pumpkin
biere
de
mars
much
better
still
worth
a
try
especially
if
youre
doing
a
horizontal
lof
tasting
t
not
sour
this
came
as
a
surprise
to
me
it
was
quite
strange
at
first
actually
it
is
strange
its
like
a
spiced
apa
with
brett
orange
lots
of
malt
spices
cobweb
and
brett
on
the
end
a
but
of
bitter
pine
like
hops
very
much
like
juniper
beer
is
medium
bodied
has
a
little
alcohol
on
the
front
the
rest
is
oddly
dry
and
spice
drinkability
is
fine
mouthfeel
is
ok
its
a
good
beer
spicy
tea
in
beer
form
d
drinkable
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
could
be
a
little
more
flavor
going
on
that
the
aroma
eludes
to
but
doesnt
deliver
on
the
tongue
pretty
good
im
glad
to
see
a
lot
of
brewers
trying
their
hand
at
wild
ales
new
belgians
is
a
pretty
good
effort
funkyness
was
fairly
resereved
with
a
substatial
malt
body
some
yeasty
esters
but
nothing
over
the
top
a
bit
of
spice
a
little
fresh
hay
and
hopping
bitterness
this
beer
is
ultra
cramy
in
the
mouth
and
its
carbonation
and
flavour
would
probably
make
it
excelent
with
a
lot
of
chesses
d
nice
belgianesque
american
craft
effort
the
lips
of
faith
series
continues
to
produce
inventive
oneoffs
which
i
love
to
sample
but
i
think
ill
continue
to
buy
them
one
at
a
time
id
say
this
makes
a
better
brew
for
the
fall
than
spring
id
take
this
over
hoptober
any
day
pours
a
clear
gold
to
light
amber
with
plenty
of
carbonation
that
settles
to
quarterinch
or
so
of
foam
with
brussels
lace
smells
a
touch
sour
light
caramel
malt
flavor
with
bitter
finish
and
a
touch
lactic
much
more
bitter
than
i
expected
and
not
bitter
in
a
good
way
poured
from
a
bomber
to
a
pint
glass
this
brew
has
a
deep
orange
color
with
hints
of
red
in
the
light
and
has
a
2
finger
white
head
from
an
aggressive
pour
leaving
a
foaming
white
head
the
aroma
is
very
spicy
with
clove
and
light
banana
the
taste
is
absolutely
strange
the
strong
malt
body
is
nothing
of
what
i
expected
of
the
color
and
aroma
there
is
a
very
odd
balance
from
the
chocolate
malts
in
a
light
colored
brew
along
with
the
spice
and
almost
a
brown
sugar
finish
i
cant
wrap
my
mind
around
the
flavors
good
but
unusual
the
lof
biere
de
mars
pours
a
deep
orange
almost
copperred
color
with
a
quick
dissolving
fizzy
head
and
no
lacing
aromas
are
mostly
malts
and
breads
some
spices
and
citrus
fruits
are
also
noticed
taste
is
very
mild
with
spices
being
the
dominant
characteristic
a
nice
malt
backbone
finishes
the
quaff
i
was
expecting
some
sour
notes
with
brett
strains
being
used
in
this
mouthfeel
is
well
carbonated
and
medium
bodied
this
is
a
sessionable
beer
even
though
the
taste
isnt
exactly
what
i
was
expecting
i
think
it
is
a
great
fall
cooler
water
brew
that
i
will
look
to
buy
in
the
future
d
drinkable
but
nothing
really
unusual
nor
memorable
d
i
was
expecting
more
from
this
beer
but
im
no
expert
on
biere
de
gardes
if
that
is
what
this
is
trying
to
be
not
a
bad
flavor
but
the
watery
mouthfeel
didnt
help
the
light
flavors
brett
was
subtle
but
somewhat
made
it
had
to
pick
out
much
of
anything
else
overall
the
beer
just
didnt
feel
right
probably
wont
drink
again
overall
a
decent
beer
but
new
belgium
may
have
missed
the
mark
with
their
experimentation
with
brettanomyces
as
it
didnt
seem
to
work
well
as
a
wild
ale
a
very
drinkable
example
of
the
style
drinkability
not
that
drinkable
for
the
fact
it
is
just
so
odd
tasting
i
just
cant
explain
how
this
is
but
it
isnt
good
i
need
to
try
erics
ale
so
i
can
try
to
get
a
positive
outlook
of
the
lips
of
faith
series
meh
this
is
the
second
time
ive
had
this
beer
and
the
second
time
ive
had
the
thought
how
can
i
taste
so
much
alcohol
at
6
2
other
than
that
it
has
a
nice
light
malt
background
a
bit
of
spice
and
a
quick
bitter
finish
mouth
is
a
bit
heavy
on
the
carbonation
i
still
love
the
fact
that
new
belgium
is
branching
out
with
the
lips
of
faith
series
this
one
just
didnt
quite
hit
the
mark
notes
i
wish
they
still
came
in
6
packs
the
bomber
i
bought
was
nine
dollars
a
little
to
much
for
my
blood
but
a
good
beer
served
from
bottle
into
duvel
tulip
pours
a
copper
color
with
a
one
finger
offwhite
head
that
subsides
to
minimal
upon
sitting
there
was
no
apparent
lacing
throughout
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
fruit
malt
and
subtle
alcohol
the
flavor
was
of
fruit
bread
and
very
subtle
alcohol
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
medium
carbonation
overall
this
is
an
excellent
brew
it
is
very
drinkable
and
not
overpowering
definitely
suggest
this
for
anyone
who
has
yet
to
try
it
or
want
to
try
this
style
d
this
beer
was
just
funky
enough
to
keep
me
interested
but
there
was
something
missing
that
i
just
couldnt
pinpoint
the
weak
appearance
definitely
hurt
but
its
still
a
nice
beer
its
just
that
there
are
better
takes
on
this
style
out
there
d
refreshing
anytimeoftheday
summer
beer
a
little
sweet
overall
for
my
preferences
go
for
the
lips
of
faith
la
folie
if
youre
looking
for
something
sour
d
yes
wonderful
very
light
bret
taste
anyone
could
enjoy
this
d
this
was
a
nice
beer
not
something
that
would
blow
my
mind
but
something
boringly
solid
i
would
love
to
see
this
as
a
summer
seasonal
and
then
get
nb
to
ny
this
drinks
really
well
however
it
doesnt
live
up
the
style
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
it
is
not
as
advertised
consumed
582010
overall
its
a
really
tasty
beer
but
its
not
what
i
remember
from
several
years
ago
when
they
used
to
do
a
spring
seasonal
by
the
same
name
i
recall
that
it
was
something
special
good
not
great
a
fine
americanized
stab
at
something
very
belgianinfluenced
possibly
the
best
contender
yet
for
the
ultimate
brett
gateway
beer
as
its
personality
is
easily
detectable
but
hardly
on
the
extreme
end
of
the
spectrum
id
definitely
buy
another
bottle
or
two
in
the
near
future
odd
i
split
a
bottle
with
a
buddy
a
few
weeks
ago
and
there
was
a
much
stronger
brettomyces
presence
this
bottle
hardly
displays
any
brett
and
the
spices
seem
to
be
much
heavier
i
much
prefer
the
bottle
i
had
previously
but
my
ratings
reflect
this
sample
honestly
i
will
have
trouble
finishing
the
whole
bomber
the
spices
are
way
too
much
there
is
very
little
else
on
the
flavor
not
much
malt
and
certainly
very
little
hops
this
is
easily
the
tamest
wild
ale
i
have
ever
had
wondering
what
spices
were
used
coriander
for
sure
and
i
am
guessing
some
cinnamon
and
allspice
maybe
even
some
cloves
bottle
says
lemon
verbena
some
sort
of
lemonesque
herb
me
no
likey
i
will
not
be
purchasing
this
one
again
that
is
for
sure
d
the
creaminess
of
the
mouth
coupled
with
any
strong
brett
funk
makes
this
a
one
bottler
i
would
put
this
up
against
any
mild
dry
white
wine
for
food
pairings
but
only
if
i
had
a
guest
that
had
never
tasted
a
brettstrong
beer
otherwise
this
is
just
too
one
dimensional
for
me
drinkability
was
very
good
crisp
along
with
mellow
flavors
no
hints
of
abv
it
played
off
of
the
cheddar
and
swiss
nicely
along
with
the
vegetables
and
apples
and
was
still
relevant
for
jerk
chicken
and
teriyaki
pork
we
did
add
some
of
the
beer
to
the
cheese
and
it
did
quite
well
this
was
a
now
i
have
tried
it
beer
despite
some
complexity
its
just
lacking
in
enough
of
the
deep
rich
or
dry
flavors
most
of
us
are
probably
seeking
worth
trying
atleast
once
for
someone
wanting
something
kinda
out
there
yet
light
to
the
taste
i
really
liked
this
beer
a
lot
its
balanced
and
has
a
nice
brett
flavor
this
is
pretty
odd
but
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
despite
it
having
a
light
lemon
flavor
im
usually
not
a
fan
of
lemon
flavored
drinks
but
this
is
a
exception
for
sure
this
was
my
first
and
i
cant
wait
to
try
the
rest
of
the
series
now
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
drinkability
is
decent
it
was
a
good
tasting
easy
drinking
wild
ale
but
not
a
real
flavorful
one
it
tasted
a
little
watered
down
and
the
flavors
seemed
a
little
muted
compared
to
others
in
the
style
both
hot
and
sweet
for
6
2
wait
this
is
listed
as
a
wild
ale
i
guess
it
was
a
little
sourlemony
d
not
very
drinkable
in
my
opinion
the
flavor
is
very
off
putting
not
sure
if
it
would
change
over
time
i
have
another
bottle
maybe
ill
let
it
sit
for
a
few
years
thats
the
next
time
i
would
want
to
try
this
one
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
compared
to
the
taste
thats
a
little
contradicting
d
very
sessionable
with
the
6
2
abv
a
refreshing
brew
a
good
one
for
early
spring
good
to
pair
with
lighter
fare
a
pleasant
but
not
great
offering
from
nbb
i
recommend
at
least
a
try
the
body
is
between
moderate
and
light
some
lighter
carbonation
but
does
allow
more
brett
notes
to
come
out
overall
a
fun
beer
but
does
vary
with
time
pours
a
clear
light
brown
yellowish
color
body
with
a
big
foamy
white
head
somewhat
lasting
funky
sour
sweet
aroma
fizzy
and
fruity
very
light
fruit
gone
as
the
head
dies
down
light
sour
taste
almost
clean
aftertaste
some
funkiness
and
earthiness
in
the
nose
especially
more
sour
as
it
warms
extremely
light
tasting
very
light
on
the
flavor
but
really
whats
the
difference
a
very
good
beer
but
not
as
wild
as
i
think
wild
ales
should
be
i
think
this
is
more
accurately
a
biere
de
garde
d
not
too
shabby
im
halfway
through
the
growler
d
this
was
a
drainpour
for
me
i
drank
my
glass
but
could
not
finish
the
bottle
drinkability
fine
much
better
than
average
new
belgian
offerings
overall
this
is
a
very
average
beer
i
dont
have
anything
to
compare
it
to
in
the
style
but
i
wasnt
hugely
impressed
it
has
some
interesting
nuances
and
is
worth
a
try
but
i
probably
wouldnt
reach
for
it
again
drinkability
pretty
good
i
liked
it
i
would
like
to
drink
it
again
d
the
brett
is
tame
in
this
one
as
is
the
carbonation
would
i
like
a
little
more
of
both
yea
but
it
sure
is
a
damn
easy
going
brew
complex
enough
to
make
you
think
basic
enough
to
not
make
you
think
too
hard
i
find
a
very
happy
medium
with
this
brew
dont
expect
orval
do
expect
a
very
mild
version
pours
a
muggy
yet
still
bright
copper
with
sunshine
hay
highlights
not
much
in
the
way
of
head
or
bubbling
foggy
morning
green
apples
with
some
herbal
notes
of
verbena
and
others
i
cant
place
also
a
tart
blackberry
aroma
as
well
the
taste
has
odd
tart
fruits
up
front
with
some
undertoned
musk
from
the
brett
lots
of
musk
in
the
front
of
that
palate
thate
recedes
to
watered
down
fuji
apple
juice
the
plate
is
a
little
funky
tart
of
course
but
vaguely
fruity
to
an
extent
this
beer
is
just
ok
in
my
book
glad
i
tried
it
but
for
9
99
i
will
not
buy
it
again
overall
a
good
but
not
great
beer
definitely
worth
trying
but
dont
knock
yourself
out
trying
to
get
it
seem
to
remember
it
having
more
flavor
in
the
old
12oz
bottle
days
before
they
retired
it
medium
recommend
rotation
would
love
to
try
ontap
for
sure
maybe
a
rare
bottle
here
and
there
overall
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
i
had
a
second
glass
of
it
since
it
was
so
good
and
drinkable
i
am
very
impressed
with
nb
on
this
one
i
hadnt
heard
anything
amazing
about
this
one
but
i
thought
it
was
awesome
i
think
this
beer
would
be
even
better
in
the
summer
12
a
bottle
of
this
is
about
right
for
me
bottle
poured
a
clear
deep
golden
color
ale
with
a
large
foamy
head
that
disappeared
way
too
quickly
without
any
lacing
aroma
of
spices
with
bland
malt
base
and
light
dry
brett
notes
taste
is
also
dominated
by
light
spice
mix
with
notes
of
bland
belgian
style
malt
with
a
very
faint
funky
aftertaste
body
is
a
bit
light
for
style
with
average
carbonation
and
no
apparent
alcohol
very
disappointing
from
a
brewery
who
usual
produce
better
offering
this
beer
is
more
of
an
introduction
to
sour
brett
beers
theres
a
big
aroma
of
wild
fruity
farmhouse
over
subtle
bready
malts
theres
just
not
a
lot
going
on
here
as
far
as
sour
beers
go
seems
average
but
quite
drinkable
conclusion
great
looking
and
really
nice
mix
of
aromas
between
brett
citrus
and
big
vanilla
overtones
the
flavors
are
a
bit
of
a
letdown
though
the
fall
wild
ale
and
la
folie
are
still
the
best
in
this
series
imo
im
enjoying
this
brew
and
find
it
pretty
drinkable
guess
im
like
the
old
cowboy
in
the
jon
dore
show
i
like
the
horse
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
alcohol
if
you
dont
know
what
im
talking
about
i
hope
someday
you
do
id
recommend
this
to
fans
of
biere
de
gardes
id
also
be
happy
to
drink
this
again
i
just
dont
understand
the
classification
of
this
beer
d
quite
drinkable
the
flavors
are
well
blended
the
abv
is
fairly
low
but
wellhidden
anyways
and
its
refreshing
enough
that
it
wouldnt
be
difficult
to
drink
a
few
pints
on
a
warm
day
drinkability
maybe
this
beer
is
an
american
wild
for
noobs
it
did
grow
on
me
after
the
first
glass
but
i
doubt
i
buy
this
one
again
the
sienna
colored
body
was
endowed
with
ample
carbonation
the
resulting
rapid
effervescence
of
which
formed
a
two
finger
thick
head
in
the
tulip
glass
the
aroma
was
malty
and
floral
with
yeast
imparted
spicy
notes
as
well
the
taste
was
like
spice
cake
with
floral
and
bready
characteristics
melding
with
faint
herbal
bitterness
and
a
spicy
phenolic
finish
the
body
was
creamy
light
and
oily
it
was
bit
too
floral
for
my
liking
but
some
others
may
find
it
attractive
overall
this
is
a
very
mild
funky
experience
and
i
could
see
this
being
a
good
beer
to
introduce
people
to
brett
nothing
exceptional
but
worth
a
shot
poured
into
a
pint
glass
has
a
light
golden
color
the
head
was
minimal
and
dissipated
rather
quickly
there
is
little
to
no
lacing
smell
has
a
sweet
malt
a
fruit
aroma
the
flavor
is
interesting
as
i
have
not
had
many
wild
ales
the
aroma
is
matched
in
the
taste
to
a
certain
extent
it
has
a
sweet
malt
flavor
but
not
as
strong
as
i
would
have
guess
from
the
aroma
i
cant
really
pinpoint
a
specific
fruit
flavor
it
finishes
with
a
heavier
mouthfeel
overall
this
a
decent
beer
it
is
fairly
easy
to
drink
it
is
nothing
that
excites
me
too
much
i
want
to
try
a
few
more
of
the
same
style
to
get
a
better
feel
for
the
flavors
as
i
was
not
able
to
give
to
much
description
on
the
taste
all
in
all
best
improvement
would
be
a
lower
final
gravity
the
slightly
heavy
mouthfeel
and
residual
sweetness
cover
up
some
of
the
more
interesting
flavors
you
really
have
to
search
to
find
them
this
is
a
very
good
beer
albeit
very
expensive
for
what
it
is
i
rated
this
as
a
biere
de
garde
this
is
not
a
wild
in
my
eyes
at
all
it
sucks
to
say
but
if
it
was
made
in
france
bottled
in
a
crusty
capped
750ml
bottle
and
labeled
as
a
saison
it
would
have
gotten
much
better
reviews
but
it
is
very
average
for
what
it
is
flavorful
but
smooth
this
beer
glides
over
the
tongue
passing
along
just
enough
flavor
that
you
know
there
is
something
going
on
but
not
so
much
that
you
bother
to
stop
and
think
about
what
that
something
is
the
lips
of
faith
line
has
been
a
pleasant
surprise
so
far
especially
considering
how
i
find
new
belgiums
standard
lineup
to
be
average
at
best
overall
not
the
most
flavorpacked
beer
but
it
is
quite
pleasant
to
drink
and
i
would
not
hesitate
to
try
it
again
d
this
beer
gets
better
and
better
as
it
warms
there
is
a
soft
funk
that
is
nice
with
a
unique
brightness
that
keeps
it
light
and
very
drinkable
thanks
to

nice

is
about
the

decent

good
finish
slightly
boozy
drinkable
i
wasnt
that
impressed
with
this
beer
its
definitely
not
a
wild
ale
as
there
is
really
no
sourness
or
funkyness
to
this
beer
that
doesnt
make
this
a
bad
beer
but
it
doesnt
align
with
the
expectations
one
has
when
purchasing
it
and
it
doesnt
follow
suite
with
the
style
its
under
not
a
style
i
would
normally
go
out
of
my
way
to
geti
havent
had
any
in
this
category
for
awhile
though
so
i
grabbed
it
poured
into
a
large
tulip
glass
a
lightly
hazed
burnt
orange
color
with
a
nice
fluffy
head
atopminimal
lace
was
left
behind
as
it
settled
slowly
light
funk
and
leather
is
what
i
picked
up
most
in
the
noseafter
it
warmed
that
lemon
verbena
came
through
slightly
flavors
are
alot
like
the
nose
but
more
complexlight
leather
and
lighter
funk
mixed
with
citriclemon
and
candied
pearsa
hint
of
vanilla
came
through
as
well
its
not
bad
and
not
heavy
on
the
funk
wich
is
good
for
mebut
lacks
a
real
punch
to
it
in
my
mind
the
best
beer
new
belgium
has
ever
produced
is
back
a
few
years
ago
this
beer
was
sold
as
a
seasonal
six
pack
available
throughout
the
months
of
march
and
april
and
then
out
of
the
blue
they
stop
producing
it
this
was
a
beer
i
look
forward
to
every
year
and
i
was
hugely
disappointed
when
i
couldnt
get
it
anymore
i
jumped
for
joy
when
i
heard
that
new
belgium
was
rereleasing
this
beer
as
part
of
their
new
lips
of
faith
bomber
series
this
classic
farmhouse
style
beer
comes
originally
comes
from
walloon
region
of
southern
belgium
the
bière
de
mars
is
a
fresh
bready
amber
ale
made
with
barley
wheat
and
oats
but
possessing
a
slightly
tart
flavor
it
is
inoculated
with
brettanomyces
a
wild
yeast
strain
that
spoils
many
beers
but
here
lends
a
mild
barnyard
or
grassy
wet
hay
flavor
not
a
wild
ale
in
my
book
tastes
more
like
a
biere
de
garde
and
the
title
seems
to
suggest
it
would
be
a
decent
christmas
spiced
beer
big
disappointment
at
least
when
rated
to
style
the
finish
for
this
beer
was
mostly
a
warming
spicy
med
body
which
trailed
off
into
a
more
dry
aftertaste
this
is
a
highly
quafable
ale
and
was
very
quenching
while
still
showing
off
its
belgian
complexity
drinkability
with
its
somewhat
subtler
brettanomyces
character
it
reminds
me
of
ommegangs
biere
de
mars
release
save
for
the
lemon
verbana
natch
id
say
i
would
pair
it
with
some
fine
cheeses
but
id
say
that
regarding
just
about
anything
no
instead
lets
pair
it
with
a
fresh
field
green
salad
with
heirloom
tomatoes
sweet
onions
and
a
bright
refreshing
lemon
vinaigrette
yes
thatll
do
nicely
the
nose
put
me
off
on
this
one
but
the
taste
drew
me
back
in
would
love
to
put
a
couple
back
to
see
what
happens
to
them
over
time
i
will
probably
buy
another
one
of
these
just
to
put
in
the
cellar
and
forget
about
for
a
long
time
i
want
to
see
if
the
brett
really
does
anything
but
for
now
its
only
okay
lightly
cloudy
golden
body
peaches
and
apricots
on
the
nose
with
a
touch
of
lemon
and
spice
peach
and
apricot
are
the
first
wave
of
flavor
then
light
lemon
tartness
barnyard
brett
and
a
lightly
spicy
finish
great
balance
of
flavors
refreshing
with
just
a
touch
of
tartness
and
brett
funk
to
keep
it
interesting
d
its
an
ok
beer
nothing
good
nor
bad
its
out
of
the
ordinary
which
is
good
its
worth
a
taste
but
only
just
once
in
my
opinion
i
love
this
beer
maybe
some
on
here
wish
for
a
stronger
brett
character
that
would
explain
the
lower
ratings
however
i
think
is
very
flavorful
and
well
balanced
something
i
would
highly
recommend
and
i
need
to
get
more
12
ounce
glass
at
najas
place
in
redondo
beach
yesterday
for
eight
dollars
part
of
the
lips
of
faith
series
from
new
belgium
and
was
not
patient
enough
to
wait
for
the
bottles
to
come
out
light
golden
orange
color
one
inch
fluffy
white
head
that
lasts
about
five
minutes
some
lace
at
the
beginning
aromas
has
grassy
accents
sweet
yeast
bananas
lemon
juice
toasted
bread
mild
funk
caramel
and
pears
starts
off
a
little
sweet
with
various
fruits
but
mostly
citrus
middle
is
chewy
with
bread
and
toasted
caramel
finish
is
slightly
dry
with
grains
and
some
lemons
in
the
aftertaste
gets
sweeter
as
it
warms
and
there
is
a
lot
of
lemon
and
orange
by
the
end
it
is
quite
malty
and
citrusy
toasted
sweet
chewy
and
crisp
mouthfeel
medium
bodied
lots
of
carbonation
taste
did
not
linger
very
long
this
stuff
was
refreshing
even
though
it
was
sweet
too
not
heavy
on
the
stomach
no
alcohol
in
the
flavor
goes
down
easy
and
is
smooth
i
love
this
style
and
am
very
critical
of
it
that
said
this
was
a
good
intepretation
this
brewery
continues
to
come
out
with
tasty
new
brews
this
hit
the
spot
on
a
hot
day
and
there
is
a
good
chance
i
will
be
back
for
more
next
weekend
if
it
is
still
on
recommended
appearance
is
decent
although
there
is
nearly
no
head
or
lacing
smell
is
very
weak
some
spiciness
and
tough
to
pick
up
too
much
else
there
is
a
bit
more
going
on
in
the
taste
some
sweetness
comes
through
mouthfeel
is
weak
drinkability
is
pretty
good
slightly
hazed
orange
brew
not
much
head
from
the
growler
nose
is
pretty
weak
although
slightly
spicy
fruity
with
citrus
decent
carbonation
and
a
little
bit
of
funk
not
an
american
wild
ale
but
a
decent
biere
de
garde
with
a
mild
hint
of
tartness
american
wild
ale
i
dont
think
so
i
really
loved
the
old
biere
de
mars
by
new
belgium
o
not
too
impressive
its
tasty
but
the
beer
is
all
over
the
place
there
isnt
anything
too
wild
about
this
beer
drinkability
a
good
choice
for
regular
revisits
as
it
is
pretty
easy
to
drink
im
not
sure
about
putting
this
one
in
the
american
wild
ale
style
though
medium
bodied
with
a
pretty
prominent
yeastybread
flavor
with
a
spicy
cinnamon
presence
and
hints
of
corriander
pepper
light
crisp
fruit
subtle
hops
and
a
slight
touch
of
brett
proving
a
refreshing
dry
finish
it
pours
a
golden
orange
with
a
quickdying
fizzy
head
of
white
foam
the
aroma
isnt
what
i
expected
theres
a
bit
of
sourness
but
i
certainly
expected
something
a
tad
more
potent
i
feel
the
same
regarding
the
flavor
theres
a
nice
sweettasting
front
and
you
certainly
sense
that
a
decent
sourness
is
forthcoming
but
it
never
materializes
this
was
good
news
to
my
sampling
partner
as
she
hates
sour
ales
but
i
was
a
little
disappointed
the
finish
is
balanced
nicely
with
some
hop
bitterness
and
lingering
nuttiness
the
mouthfeeltexture
is
fine
and
its
mild
flavor
makes
it
quite
drinkable
d
this
beer
is
definitely
not
a
wild
ale
or
not
a
very
good
one
anyway
there
is
almost
no
brett
character
and
no
sourness
if
this
is
an
american
wild
ale
its
one
where
the
brett
hasnt
kicked
in
at
all
a
standard
bier
de
mars
and
not
even
a
very
good
one
at
that
with
absolutely
no
hint
of
sourness
or
funk
pours
golden
with
the
slightest
bit
of
haze
a
thin
head
and
no
lacing
smells
quite
citrusy
with
orange
and
lemon
at
first
but
there
is
also
a
slight
soapiness
at
the
end
the
taste
is
fairly
bland
somewhat
slick
and
soapy
and
vaguely
fruity
with
an
almost
lager
yeast
finish
overripe
papaya
and
mango
round
it
out
a
little
too
slick
and
smooth
in
the
mouth
not
at
all
what
i
was
expecting
and
a
definite
disappointment
lips
of
faith
bottling
in
a
bomber
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
hazy
amber
gold
color
with
a
creamy
thick
light
beige
head
very
nice
lacing
aroma
is
obviously
lemony
and
although
ive
never
had
lemon
verbena
i
imagine
thats
what
its
from
comes
off
less
acidic
and
more
like
lemon
sorbet
though
also
some
sweet
grainy
character
in
the
smell
honey
graham
some
lemon
tartness
a
smidgeon
of
bretty
funk
in
the
form
of
phenols
sweet
bread
light
earthiness
rather
complex
for
a
nb
beer
but
all
the
notes
are
on
the
sweet
side
which
limits
the
drinkability
a
bit
mouthfeel
is
solid
with
a
nice
heft
on
the
palate
and
a
good
but
not
quite
belgian
fineness
of
carbonation
better
than
i
expected
easy
to
drink
and
quite
refreshing
would
try
again
for
sure
d
a
nice
blend
of
flavors
but
not
as
good
as
other
biere
de
gardes
i
would
probably
not
get
this
one
again
we
load
as
much
as
we
can
carry
drag
in
bags
behind
us
through
the
corridors
escape
back
to
the
ocean
salt
air
the
wind
and
the
sun
our
ship
seems
to
have
shifted
a
longer
swim
and
weighed
down
we
must
tell
our
families
we
will
be
back
here
this
beer
tastes
very
nice
its
smooth
to
drink
but
almost
too
drinkable
like
a
session
beer
but
i
dont
think
thats
the
intention
this
taste
is
orangy
but
that
goes
quickly
to
some
light
hopes
and
a
nice
bitter
end
overall
very
good
poured
cloudy
yellowgold
with
a
frothy
white
head
okay
retention
moderate
lacing
mellow
funky
floral
aroma
with
white
pepper
and
spice
smooth
taste
melon
mostly
with
some
lemon
peel
and
citrus
flavors
the
yeast
is
not
funky
as
the
nose
but
more
on
the
sweet
side
kind
of
taking
the
edge
if
any
off
of
the
grain
and
spice
everything
was
a
little
too
subdued
but
that
led
to
a
very
easydrinking
beer
i
really
think
this
was
just
another
take
on
the
biere
de
mars
although
this
wasnt
very
orange
looking
d
very
goes
back
easy
not
a
lot
of
alc
and
finishes
clean
and
refreshing
d
perfect
beer
to
sip
on
a
hot
day
to
bad
it
is
so
expensive
or
i
would
by
it
in
cases
22oz
bomber
poured
into
a
duvel
snifter
a
crisp
bubbly
orange
with
a
decent
khaki
head
thats
slow
to
diminish
aroma
is
an
intriguing
blend
of
spices
and
floral
hops
with
slight
sweet
malts
the
taste
is
a
very
enjoyable
initial
that
loses
a
bit
as
it
lingers
but
still
impresses
nice
balance
of
sweet
malts
crisp
hops
and
spices
the
beer
is
quite
light
and
crisp
with
decent
carbonation
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
and
unique
beer
d
very
drinkable
interesting
and
flavorful
d
easy
drinking
beer
this
is
downright
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
lots
of
different
things
going
on
not
really
that
accessible
to
a
beginner
but
to
a
seasoned
drinker
looking
for
a
bit
of
a
workout
this
hits
the
notes
in
all
reality
entirely
too
expensive
though
so
happy
to
have
this
back
3
years
is
a
long
time
but
absence
makes
the
heart
grow
fonder
the
aroma
of
this
one
is
in
my
top
5
easy
strong
and
sweetspice
taste
is
sweet
but
then
the
spice
and
alc
kick
in
i
cant
get
past
this
one
the
drinkability
and
taste
puts
it
way
above
all
i
love
the
sourness
and
it
lingering
taste
of
spice
great
brew
all
around
not
a
bad
offering
from
nb
a
10
ounce
glass
of
this
would
be
the
perfect
serving
size
flavor
starts
with
a
big
kick
of
fruit
and
spiced
yeast
esters
that
lean
towards
lemon
peel
nutmeg
and
allspice
no
one
flavor
dominates
thankfully
and
the
finish
encounters
some
brett
funk
paired
with
a
smooth
yet
crisp
malt
backbone
of
biscuit
and
cracker
complex
mouthfeel
with
a
prickly
medium
body
that
fades
to
a
sweet
almost
creamy
middle
and
a
tart
finish
with
brett
drying
out
the
palate
a
low
abv
helps
with
the
drinkability
as
this
beer
borders
on
being
too
heavy
with
spices
but
pulls
back
just
in
time
surprisingly
refreshing
on
a
hot
austin
day
aggressive
pour
yields
a
small
white
bubbly
head
that
dissipates
quickly
and
leaves
almost
no
lacing
the
beer
itself
is
a
golden
color
with
almost
no
haze
it
smells
of
damp
wood
light
hops
and
mild
malt
sweetness
the
flavor
is
very
dry
some
what
bitter
with
a
light
tartness
hints
of
apricot
mix
with
a
nice
toasty
flavor
some
pine
hop
character
as
well
the
body
is
some
what
light
with
a
nice
dryness
and
some
crispness
from
the
carbonation
and
hops
i
would
have
to
say
this
is
not
my
favorite
style
but
it
is
worth
trying
22oz
lips
of
faith
series
bottle
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
orange
brown
with
a
thin
18
inch
white
head
looks
nice
though
i
expected
it
to
be
maybe
a
shade
darker
smells
of
allspice
nutmeg
some
clove
belgian
malt
plums
a
nice
interesting
nose
flavor
is
nice
too
though
maybe
overthetop
with
spices
biscuity
malt
body
as
expected
from
nb
some
toffee
and
figs
a
bit
more
like
a
spiced
winter
warmer
than
a
biere
de
mars
but
i
guess
its
a
style
thats
open
to
some
interpretation
fairly
refreshing
and
not
too
heavy
medium
bodied
quite
good
though
nothing
all
that
memorable
i
kept
sipping
to
try
to
discern
all
the
flavors
and
didnt
mind
doing
so
an
interesting
pleasant
mix
that
i
enjoyed
drinking
22oz
bottle
9
which
is
kind
of
expensive
but
whatever
really
nice
looking
orange
color
wispy
head
that
is
really
just
swirls
of
white
at
the
surface
of
the
beer
the
smell
of
this
beer
is
straight
animalistic
like
sweat
dripping
off
the
bristles
of
a
feral
hogs
back
whew
its
strong
piggy
manure
aromas
heavy
brett
and
reminds
me
of
avery
15
a
little
prickly
on
the
tongue
but
the
taste
is
pretty
refined
lemony
but
not
sour
zesty
almost
this
was
a
good
beer
but
given
the
price
i
wont
be
making
a
second
purchase
md
on
the
lighter
side
and
very
crisp
and
well
carbonated
finishes
somewhat
dry
very
easy
drinking
just
not
the
greatest
taste
its
to
boozy
for
me
to
say
i
would
want
another
one
or
that
its
easy
to
drink
maybe
i
got
the
bottom
of
the
keg
and
need
to
try
it
again
mouth
is
delicately
carbonated
and
leaves
a
great
aftertase
drinks
easy
especially
for
a
hot
day
d
this
was
a
very
good
beer
pretty
different
in
an
enjoyable
way
makes
me
anxious
to
try
some
of
the
other
lips
of
faith
beers
drinkability
is
pretty
high
a
really
nice
biere
de
mars
i
prefer
more
fruity
esters
in
the
style
which
came
out
more
as
it
warmed
im
not
a
big
fan
of
brett
on
its
own
but
there
wasnt
much
horse
here
and
enough
extra
ompph
that
it
provided
a
nice
layer
of
depth
without
overwhelming
my
palate
when
this
keg
blew
i
was
sad
medium
carbonation
and
soft
on
the
palate
very
easy
to
drink
and
would
definitely
have
some
more
if
i
could
pour
is
pineapple
yellow
but
extremely
cloudy
bit
too
much
for
the
style
smell
is
the
biscuit
yeast
style
that
many
of
there
other
beers
have
quite
a
bit
of
yeast
the
breadest
beer
ive
had
in
a
while
i
dont
know
if
its
a
good
thing
when
you
have
get
that
protein
ok
palate
was
lemon
peels
mangos
and
a
light
hop
with
a
finish
of
that
yeast
light
sweet
quite
a
thick
body
for
a
biere
de
mars
this
is
all
compromised
i
suppose
for
the
consistent
head
of
thick
white
d
this
is
delicious
im
glad
this
beer
was
brought
back
overall
it
definitely
has
a
lot
of
character
this
is
a
style
im
not
too
familiar
with
so
it
is
difficult
to
compare
relative
to
the
style
but
i
enjoyed
it
i
just
dont
think
i
can
drink
too
much
due
to
the
strong
sweet
and
sour
going
on
i
was
over
it
by
the
middle
of
the
pint
pours
a
cloudy
goldenamber
color
14
inch
head
of
a
white
color
good
retention
and
good
lacing
smells
of
slight
banana
sweet
malt
some
hops
and
some
coriander
spice
in
the
background
fits
the
style
of
a
biere
de
garde
mouth
feel
is
very
smooth
and
slight
thick
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
sweet
malt
up
front
then
some
sweetness
and
banana
flavors
dominate
slight
hop
background
comes
through
next
some
tart
malt
is
present
and
finishes
with
a
hint
of
dry
spice
overall
a
very
good
beer
that
i
had
in
combination
with
a
flank
steak
and
both
were
amazing
my
first
experience
with
the
lips
of
faith
series
and
i
cant
wait
to
have
another
drinkability
a
nice
beer
to
drink
while
wondering
when
the
weather
is
finally
going
to
turn
for
the
better
the
flavor
is
nice
but
the
light
body
may
wear
out
its
welcome
after
a
few
beers
i
will
most
likely
revisit
this
one
before
spring
is
over
looking
forward
to
trying
it
again
soon
had
on
tap
at
ciceros
in
st
louis
poured
into
pint
glass
pours
a
medium
golden
color
with
a
half
finger
of
fizzy
white
head
smell
is
faint
but
that
oh
so
familiar
belgian
beer
smell
is
there
along
with
hints
of
citrus
taste
is
kind
of
fruity
and
floral
up
front
with
a
lot
of
banana
and
ester
in
it
lightmedium
mouthfeel
with
a
clean
quenching
finish
very
drinkable
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
beer
this
is
my
first
beer
from
the
lips
of
faith
series
and
im
impressed
definitely
a
beer
id
recommend
to
anyone
d
a
very
drinkable
beer
with
lots
of
character
i
am
a
fan
of
this
style
it
has
a
strong
amber
color
and
it
left
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
i
have
a
poor
sense
of
smell
but
i
could
smell
the
citrus
in
this
and
that
taste
comes
across
very
subtly
i
had
several
of
these
and
shared
and
everyone
at
the
table
ended
up
ordering
1
for
themselves
d
little
malt
or
hops
flavors
only
mineralchemical
taste
overall
ok
but
not
one
that
i
would
strongly
recommend
d
a
nice
spring
beer
i
dont
think
ive
ever
had
an
american
version
of
this
style
aside
from
lost
abbeys
so
i
was
anxious
to
try
it
solid
brew
i
thought
all
around
though
i
got
a
little
bored
by
the
end
of
the
glass
1050
one
of
the
better
brews
to
come
out
of
new
belgium
it
is
a
glowing
orangish
color
with
a
silky
white
head
the
nose
was
a
collection
of
tropical
and
citrus
fruits
with
some
delicate
hops
the
taste
was
tangy
and
sweet
with
fresh
fruit
and
candy
malt
quiet
hops
still
keep
things
in
check
crisp
medium
body
leads
to
a
very
drinkable
beer
this
beer
has
lost
all
life
the
only
remnants
are
some
sweet
malt
and
a
hint
of
wet
paper
a
hint
of
lemon
in
the
nose
beyond
that
not
cellar
worthy
d
i
wish
they
wouldnt
of
stop
making
this
one
it
has
a
great
different
taste
to
it
i
would
of
bought
a
few
6
packs
of
this
also
though
this
is
off
by
about
a
year
got
this
a
while
ago
in
a
trade
but
forgot
who
it
was
but
thanks
who
ever
you
are
has
best
before
march
05
poured
a
cloudy
light
copper
with
a
lot
of
floaters
and
a
small
off
white
head
aroma
orange
and
lemon
zest
mixed
together
lots
of
yeast
sugar
when
it
warmed
a
bit
got
some
wheat
and
sourness
flavor
a
nice
citrus
mix
of
orange
tangerine
lemon
sugar
a
hint
of
alcohol
a
slight
taste
of
grass
this
is
a
very
good
beer
would
like
to
get
my
hands
on
a
fresh
bottle
pours
a
nice
hazy
gold
to
peach
in
color
with
a
decent
sized
cream
colored
effervescent
head
lemon
and
a
light
honey
sweetness
in
the
aroma
along
with
straw
lightly
spiced
sweet
applesauce
and
a
little
funkiness
some
mildly
tart
lemon
flavor
in
the
taste
a
little
of
the
honey
sweetness
a
clovey
smokiness
and
grassiness
mouthfeel
is
a
ride
from
a
little
tartness
to
a
fuzzy
and
smooth
middle
and
a
dry
finish
quite
complex
in
aroma
taste
and
mouthfeel
i
very
much
enjoyed
this
this
biere
de
mars
poured
a
cloudy
golden
brown
color
with
creamy
offwhite
foam
that
settled
but
clung
to
the
glass
a
little
bit
the
smell
was
lemony
citrus
with
some
wheat
aroma
and
a
mild
subtle
yeasty
aroma
the
taste
was
lightly
tangy
with
citrus
notes
and
some
wheat
maltiness
there
was
a
floral
flavor
with
a
hint
of
spices
and
tangerine
as
well
as
some
peppery
notes
the
mouthfeel
was
very
smooth
and
creamy
with
medium
body
and
mild
carbonation
and
with
a
nice
witbierlike
finish
this
was
a
very
enjoyable
easy
drinking
beer
and
i
hear
it
is
expected
to
cellar
well
i
will
see
as
i
have
tucked
away
a
sixpack
beautiful
cloudy
orange
color
head
falls
a
little
quickly
though
smells
musty
spicy
yeast
fruity
not
a
style
im
familiar
with
taste
is
very
nice
with
some
apple
fresh
bread
except
a
little
too
sweet
for
me
which
creates
a
cloying
mouthfeel
that
ive
docked
points
for
some
reviewers
noted
too
much
carbonation
i
didnt
maybe
it
was
because
my
bottle
was
older
but
best
before
date
is
still
1
5
months
away
but
i
thought
it
could
have
used
a
little
more
carbonation
to
cut
through
the
sweetness
id
drink
it
again
but
probably
not
tonight
medium
to
light
mouthfeel
grainy
with
a
fruity
flavors
spice
kick
at
the
end
no
real
bitterness
but
the
yeast
lingers
too
long
if
you
poured
the
whole
bottle
out
into
the
glass
not
bad
however
high
alcohol
will
sneak
up
on
you
with
this
smooth
light
beer
d
ah
there
is
nothing
special
about
this
brew
its
not
like
it
taste
like
crap
i
just
dont
look
forward
to
drinking
another
one
this
beer
went
down
alright
wasnt
hard
to
drink
but
for
some
reason
i
didnt
reach
for
another
one
i
just
wasnt
that
into
it
i
guess
a
tasty
brew
i
might
not
kick
back
a
sixer
of
these
all
in
one
go
but
by
the
time
i
finsihed
one
i
found
myself
thirsting
for
another
which
is
always
a
good
sign
flavors
was
overall
bland
at
first
the
hops
and
alcohol
were
nonexistent
behind
a
moldy
flavoring
after
a
bit
a
slight
hop
bitterness
came
out
and
something
that
is
akin
to
alcohol
heat
but
honestly
i
am
not
quite
sure
the
yeat
is
kind
of
pungent
i
usually
like
yeast
flavors
but
in
this
beer
it
is
a
bit
of
a
turnoff
because
it
is
so
musty
medium
body
that
kind
of
clings
around
the
nasal
cavity
which
helps
the
flavor
linger
goes
down
easy
enough
but
just
a
fairly
average
brew
d
tons
of
differentg
flavors
in
there
this
is
a
brew
that
needs
full
attention
to
be
appericated
not
a
session
brew
wonderful
desert
brew
this
is
a
real
treat
d
good
drinkability
unique
beer
i
have
had
about
four
spread
out
over
the
last
4
months
and
it
keeps
evolving
somewhat
i
am
anxious
to
see
where
it
goes
i
think
it
will
continue
to
drink
well
for
a
while
pours
a
hazy
golden
yellow
with
a
very
nice
white
head
yeast
and
citrus
on
the
nose
flavors
are
saison
meets
belgian
ale
like
sour
sweet
and
spicy
bread
throughout
along
with
lemon
with
some
spice
a
tad
thin
but
refreshing
and
nice
merger
of
styleflavor
thanks
to
jhammerly
for
the
bottle
body
is
on
the
light
side
wellcarbonated
and
has
a
harsh
almost
abrasive
mouthfeel
ive
had
better
from
nb
i
was
really
ready
to
get
down
on
this
beer
but
i
think
i
over
hyped
it
in
my
own
mind
the
color
was
a
straw
tinted
orange
with
a
bit
of
haze
and
a
chunky
white
head
in
my
duvel
glass
smells
citrus
with
a
little
pinnaple
or
date
over
a
sweet
malt
driven
yeasty
fullness
taste
is
twisted
and
not
really
one
i
like
a
bit
to
citrus
and
the
yeast
messes
weird
with
everything
else
i
will
have
to
try
this
again
but
right
now
not
so
much
d
drinkable
this
is
my
first
biere
de
garde
very
tasty
brew
from
nb
a
nice
thirst
quencher
thanks
to
orrshow
for
sharing
the
wealth
after
his
fathers
vegas
trip
this
ones
a
real
summer
sipper
it
grows
on
you
but
i
dont
believe
ill
be
much
of
a
fan
of
this
one
pretty
drinkable
just
not
sure
id
enjoy
more
than
2
due
to
the
style
pretty
spot
on
representation
imho
poured
into
a
gobletstyle
glass
a
hazy
goldenorange
and
a
very
thin
head
the
sweet
aroma
of
oranges
pineapple
and
some
spices
this
is
different
to
say
the
least
there
are
definite
characteristics
of
a
belgian
but
there
is
something
else
that
i
cant
place
mouthfeel
is
thin
to
medium
which
can
help
with
its
drinkibility
but
i
couldnt
have
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
this
is
not
really
my
style
thanks
for
letting
me
try
this
coloradobob
its
definately
unique
its
like
a
rollercoaster
that
you
puke
after
you
dont
regret
taking
the
ride
but
youre
not
so
sure
youd
do
it
again
i
had
this
before
and
never
thought
much
of
it
but
this
year
i
was
told
there
was
some
brett
funkiness
added
so
i
tried
it
and
im
glad
i
did
it
poured
cloudy
and
orange
and
smelled
like
a
wild
hoppy
ale
the
taste
is
pleasant
and
easy
and
would
make
a
great
intro
to
the
style
since
the
tartness
is
mild
despite
the
funk
it
would
be
a
great
food
beer
draught
new
belgium
cloudy
orange
haze
lemony

with
other
hints
of
apple
passion
fruits
and
peach
light
grainy
toasty
herbal
almost
minty
flavor
with
a
slight
hint
of
a
brettanomyces
contribution
ive
never
been
fond
of
this
one
southamptons
biere
de
mars
is
like
threehundred
times
better
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
a
34
offwhite
head
above
the
cloudy
amber
brew
head
lasts
well
fading
slowly
with
lots
of
sticky
lacing
aroma
is
malty
sweet
and
abundantly
spiced
taste
is
lightly
sweet
with
a
citric
tang
and
spices
on
top
a
bit
busy
for
me
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
not
bad
was
just
hoping
for
a
little
bit
more
an
acceptable
biere
de
garde
that
i
would
revisit
if
the
occasion
presented
itself
taste
was
a
bit
of
the
opposite
more
lemon
than
malt
yet
the
malt
makes
it
thicker
than
it
looks
drinks
well
mouthfeel
is
yeasty
lightly
carbonated
deep
orange
color
12
inch
head
with
decent
retention
very
cloudy
the
smell
is
fairly
tart
with
spicy
orange
lemon
and
acetaldehyde
notes
the
taste
is
mildly
tart
with
some
sweetness
again
lemon
orange
sour
apple
flavors
are
present
with
a
hint
of
spice
and
belgian
yeast
the
sour
apple
flavor
tends
to
dominate
not
overly
puckering
and
it
has
enough
sweetness
to
balance
things
out
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
with
a
medium
body
nice
coating
ability
and
excellent
carbonation
drinkablity
rates
well
as
it
is
a
nice
mild
weather
brew
a
bit
wheaty
but
not
too
light
on
flavor
definitely
worth
a
try
overall
really
enjoyed
this
one
flavors
really
drew
me
in
and
i
liked
the
process
of
drinking
the
beer
even
though
i
couldnt
imagine
having
many
of
these
in
a
row
very
unique
i
really
dont
know
how
this
compares
to
other
biere
de
gardes
as
this
is
my
first
but
i
was
really
hoping
for
more
character
from
a
farmhouse
ale
a
la
saison
still
tastes
good
to
me
though
pours
a
cloudy
light
amber
with
minimal
head
and
ok
tracing
aromas
are
quite
yeasty
bready
and
wet
hay
there
is
a
citrus
and
spicy
background
as
well
carbonation
is
medium
and
well
fitting
mouthfeel
is
light
and
flavors
mirror
those
aromas
well
this
is
an
excellent
winter
seasonal
and
ive
enjoyed
the
6er
as
this
is
the
last
bottle
alcohol
hits
you
a
little
in
the
end
as
well
as
the
mild
hops
wish
they
would
carry
this
year
round
but
the
trippel
and
abbey
will
suffice
d
to
my
knowlege
this
is
the
first
beer
of
this
style
that
i
have
ever
tried
this
beer
was
a
little
bland
for
my
liking
had
a
nice
aroma
to
it
but
overall
i
dont
think
i
would
try
again
sorry
this
beer
is
of
little
use
to
me
nose
a
touch
of
cloves
some
verbena
some
yeast
and
musty
malt
tasted
a
bit
sweet
and
fruity
up
front
with
a
tartness
that
jumped
in
quickly
and
persisted
through
the
rather
dry
finish
drinkable
but
not
a
session
beer
for
me
i
can
get
a
six
pack
of
this
cheaper
than
one
bottle
of
french
biere
de
garde
damn
good
buy
and
a
nice
beer
dont
really
know
what
to
say
about
this
one
its
not
like
any
other
beer
ive
had
but
thats
not
necessarily
a
good
thing
im
not
particularly
impressed
or
disappointed
i
dont
like
or
dislike
it
as
its
been
over
two
years
since
ive
sampled
one
of
these
i
thought
id
give
it
a
shot
in
the
glass
the
beer
appears
a
somewhat
hazy
orange
with
a
modest
semicreamy
light
tan
head
which
after
its
decomposition
leaves
a
fine
coating
of
lace
upon
the
glass
nose
has
a
pleasant
malt
sweetness
hints
of
ripe
fruit
with
a
bit
of
bread
dough
start
is
sweet
with
a
pleasant
grain
profile
and
the
top
moderate
in
feel
finish
has
a
cutting
acidity
the
hops
light
but
pleasant
to
the
palate
a
decent
drinking
beer
but
i
rank
it
second
to
last
on
new
belgiums
beer
list
the
last
being
loft
just
cant
say
they
appeal
to
me
nonetheless
they
are
drinkable
and
will
appeal
to
many
i
tried
this
beer
last
year
and
thought
it
was
decent
but
this
year
it
seems
to
be
so
much
better
2006
bottling
clever
and
interesting
seasonal
offering
for
the
halfwinterhalfspring
month
of
march
but
i
enjoyed
this
one
while
sunning
myself
in
my
motherinlaws
back
yard
on
a
gorgeous
80degree
tucson
afternoon
anyway
poured
into
a
cervoisewine
goblet
new
belgiums
biere
de
mars
is
an
extremely
cloudy
golden
amber
topped
with
a
creamy
white
fluff
funky
yeast
aroma
scents
of
mown
grass
and
soured
apple
juice
abide
thicker
mouthfeel
than
i
ever
could
have
expected
most
of
new
belgiums
beers
that
ive
tried
are
at
least
on
some
level
characteristically
crisp
and
refreshing
the
lack
of
crispness
here
is
not
a
problem
its
velvety
smooth
luxurious
even
the
first
sip
reveals
tart
barnyard
funk
flavors
which
cede
to
a
biscuity
malt
structure
it
then
finishes
lemony
smooth
like
a
pudding
almost
there
is
also
a
difficulttoidentify
flavor
that
rides
all
around
the
middle
of
each
sip
i
imagine
it
must
be
some
kind
of
phenol
tastes
kind
of
like
plastic
or
soft
rubber
this
flavor
emerges
in
the
burps
as
well
complexity
of
flavor
alone
merits
a
high
score
here
i
can
safely
say
ive
never
had
any
beer
like
this
before
its
definitely
belgian
and
definitely
country
it
is
not
at
all
reminiscent
of
other
bieres
de
garde
ive
sampled
this
one
is
entirely
in
a
class
of
its
own
and
outstanding
at
that
pours
a
slightly
hazy
orange
hue
topped
by
a
nice
big
white
sticky
head
that
laces
nicely
aroma
is
unique
light
sweet
malt
citrus
and
a
heavy
peaty
smokiness
palate
is
balanced
between
subtle
fruity
european
hops
and
a
light
sweet
malt
character
spices
are
a
heavy
presence
with
some
orange
peel
coriander
and
a
touch
of
pepper
coming
through
body
is
substantial
and
creamy
finish
leaves
a
strange
astringency
almost
like
chloraseptic
an
interesting
take
on
a
nearlyextinct
old
world
style
cloudy
glazed
orange
topped
with
an
eggshell
colored
head
of
small
bubbles
the
head
dissipates
leaving
a
brief
collar
and
minimal
lacing
there
a
few
fine
carbonation
streams
the
smell
is
fruity
and
filled
with
orange
blossom
and
lemon
coupled
with
some
wheat
notes
the
taste
is
wheaty
initially
with
some
citrus
fruit
sweet
and
tart
notes
finishes
tart
and
of
lemon
rind
dry
and
with
just
a
touch
of
astringency
fruit
rind
flavors
persist
and
leave
each
swallow
wanting
for
the
next
medium
bodied
and
with
a
light
almost
fizzy
mouthfeel
this
gets
a
bit
tarter
as
it
warms
complex
mix
of
malts
and
their
yeast
make
this
a
tasty
treat
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
full
with
a
wheaty
texture
the
draft
version
puts
the
bottle
to
shame
its
almost
a
different
beer
altogether
i
would
rate
the
draft
a
full
point
higher
than
the
bottleif
i
wasnt
so
busy
drinking
all
of
it
a
solid
beer
from
nb
i
hope
they
plan
to
release
this
one
again
a
damn
good
representation
carbonation
is
relatively
low
which
gives
the
flavors
an
opportunity
to
really
run
amuck
and
makes
it
an
excellent
thirst
quencher
and
a
fine
companion
at
the
table
along
with
fantômes
la
gourmande
this
might
be
about
the
most
versatile
food
beers
i
know
kudos
to
new
belgium
for
putting
out
such
a
distinctive
beer
this
years
edition
is
a
big
step
up
from
prior
releases
of
this
seasonal
truly
great
beer
im
on
my
third
case
and
may
well
get
through
a
couple
more
before
its
gone
uf
drinkable
to
die
for
not
one
to
chug
but
a
good
one
to
have
with
a
hot
dinner
maybe
something
spicy
appearance
is
a
cloudy
orange
color
with
very
little
white
head
aroma
is
pleasant
a
little
citrusy
taste
is
quite
complex
coriander
yeast
citrus
fruit
and
quite
a
bit
of
pepper
no
real
overpowering
alcohol
component
definitely
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
the
everyday
not
something
id
consider
a
favorite
but
a
nicely
done
beer
taken
as
a
whole
this
beer
is
not
bad
it
has
lots
of
good
qualities
but
nothing
that
jumps
out
at
me
as
being
a
great
beer
that
i
would
drink
all
of
the
time
not
that
it
is
available
all
of
the
time
i
would
like
this
on
a
hot
day
otherwise
known
as
a
san
antonio
winter
day
god
its
hot
here
all
the
more
reason
to
drink
cold
beer
cheers
the
mouth
is
chewy
but
smooth
easy
enough
to
session
i
would
like
to
be
able
to
get
this
one
at
home
this
was
on
tap
at
the
chocolate
bar
hazy
gold
straw
colored
with
a
thin
white
head
delicate
aroma
of
citrus
orange
a
little
clove
and
a
hint
of
fresh
bread
the
taste
is
light
and
citrusy
nice
orange
bitterness
balanced
by
a
hint
of
clove
and
white
pepper
just
a
touch
of
heat
light
and
satisfying
mouth
feel
this
would
be
a
great
summer
beer
heck
its
a
great
anytime
beer
new
beligiums
seasonals
rock
the
2
degrees
below
is
good
this
beer
is
great
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
but
the
abv
is
a
little
high
and
might
sneak
up
on
you
if
one
were
to
knock
back
too
many
of
these
veryy
fast
i
had
two
its
a
spring
beer
but
i
think
it
would
be
good
ice
cold
in
the
summer
as
well
its
a
little
fruitier
than
a
lot
of
beers
and
i
can
see
how
some
folks
might
not
care
for
it
i
like
lemon
in
my
hefe
and
a
slice
of
lemon
might
do
well
in
a
de
mars
as
well
goes
down
like
a
vivid
dream
rich
and
fleshed
out
but
fleeting
and
ending
ever
too
soon
crisp
and
refreshing
a
great
beer
for
the
summer
overall
not
the
most
complex
taste
but
good
mouthfeel
a
wonderful
beer
from
new
belgium
on
a
side
note
this
is
a
great
accompaniment
to
cheesy
pasta
dishes
taste
is
thinner
than
aroma
somewhat
watery
mouthfeel
a
touch
of
bubbles
bready
flavor
moderately
malty
would
like
a
bit
more
earthymusty
character
but
this
isnt
too
bad
this
beer
tastes
just
as
described
by
new
belgium
which
to
me
means
they
achieved
their
goal
it
also
matches
the
style
well
and
i
will
certainly
enjoy
this
one
on
occasions
but
not
necessarily
in
my
regular
rotation
afterthoughts
this
is
a
beer
ill
buy
again
not
something
that
makes
me
say
wow
but
a
very
drinkable
beer
d
i
feel
that
one
is
enough
per
sitting
nice
change
of
pace
but
lacks
certain
qualities
that
a
session
beer
has
very
drinkable
a
pinch
of
salt
or
twist
of
lemon
might
make
it
even
better
a
very
clean
finish
with
no
hop
flavor
very
drinkable
had
this
on
tap
at
the
brewery
yesterday
appearance
is
a
hazy
orange
with
ivory
foam
and
nicely
retentive
lacing
aroma
has
notes
of
orange
curacao
spice
and
floral
hops
initial
taste
is
of
watery
malt
spices
pepper
and
cloves
citrus
biscuits
fruit
and
a
hint
of
honey
finish
is
dry
filled
with
yeast
and
not
good
a
true
belgian
style
its
one
of
those
beers
either
you
love
the
eathyness
or
you
hate
it
pours
a
dirty
copper
or
orange
brown
smells
of
organic
malting
deep
rich
sour
and
yeasty
on
the
side
of
salty
tastes
of
sour
malt
american
hops
that
give
a
bitter
and
metalic
flavor
body
reveals
organic
flavors
on
the
side
of
fresh
water
clams
or
oysters
similar
in
flavor
to
orval
trapist
but
not
as
melded
or
complex
finishes
earthy
and
lingering
although
a
medium
flavor
persists
remains
metalic
and
a
bit
buttery
actually
helps
all
in
all
not
a
goood

and
some

is

the

a

are

to
consume
new
belgium
could
easily
be
a
favorite
brewery
for
me
if
only
someone
would
carry
them
out
this
way
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
mildly
crisp
at
the
start
the
finish
is
short
with
most
of
the
flavors
lingering
on
the
tongue
for
a
second
or
two
medium
bodied
nice
drinkability
as
this
is
refreshing
brew
drinking
a
few
of
these
in
one
sitting
is
easy
the
nose
is
dryish
with
some
coriander
wheatish
malt
and
a
light
hint
of
yeasty
fruitiness
and
its
pillowysoft
in
the
mouth
with
a
veryfine
bubbled
median
carbonation
that
leaves
a
delicate
caress
on
the
tongue
as
it
passes
smoothly
away
the
flavor
is
dry
with
coriander
and
lightly
sweet
with
wheataccented
malt
a
touch
citrusy
and
just
slightly
acidic
yeasty
but
not
overly
so
and
backed
by
a
sublime
bitterness
that
helps
to
dry
the
finish
in
concert
with
its
lingering
spiciness
it
works
well
at
almost
any
time
of
year
but
is
particularly
nice
as
a
summer
and
fall
beer
and
it
pairs
well
with
some
of
the
lesserspiced
thai
foods
mushroomstuffed
chicken
breast
in
cream
sauce
grilled
pork
chops
and
baked
apples
dont
know
how
to
describe
this
one
i
was
taken
back
by
how
complex
the
flavour
and
hues
are
not
to
mention
the
smell
i
opened
this
baby
up
poured
it
into
my
snifter
and
let
it
sit
on
the
table
for
about
10
minutes
to
open
up
the
flavours
i
have
to
say
it
drinks
well
and
has
me
wanting
more
not
too
strong
of
a
beer
so
its
easy
to
take
on
would
make
a
nice
dinner
beer
or
even
a
nice
after
dinner
beer
sitting
on
the
porch
watching
the
sunset
which
almost
has
the
same
color
combinations
as
this
beautiful
beer
definately
on
my
list
of
keepers
the
flavors
and
mouthfeel
build
as
it
opens
and
warms
a
bit
soft
gentle
beer
with
just
a
bit
of
a
belgian
hop
bite
nice
carbonation
level
and
light
body
make
this
a
nice
refreshing
ale
could
be
a
nice
session
ale
even
at

alcohol
this
beer
poured
a
chill
hazed
dark
blonde
the
head
was
white
and
did
not
last
long
there
was
an
earthy
aroma
but
not
much
else
the
taste
lacked
the
maltiness
but
the
spicy
character
more
than
made
up
for
it
no
off
notes
in
either
the
nose
or
the
tongue
the
beer
was
medium
bodied
and
gave
the
impression
of
high
carbonation
i
dont
know
if
it
was
from
carbonation
or
the
spice
playing
with
the
tongue
a
very
enjoyable
beer
this
is
definately
refreshing
and
if
you
are
like
many
for
whom
a
wit
or
saison
is
out
of
range
physically
or
monitarily
this
is
a
decent
substitute
when
the
need
arises
as
a
beer
to
keep

and
one
of
the
best
from
a
brewery
that
puts
out
some
great
products
and
im
not
talking
about
fat
tire
very
much
like
a
saison
for
me
the
biggest
standout
is
the
floral
additions
and
the
great
base
yeast
once
again
from
stillwater
too
sweet
tastes
like
a
dessert
wine
almost
like
a
barley
sauternes
add
some
hop
character
to
increase
bitterness
and
this
could
be
a
real
winner
ive
largely
been
a
big
fan
of
the
stillwater
offerings
ive
tried
but
débutante
really
failed
to
impress
in
hindsight
i
would
have
been
much
happier
with
any
of
the
other
4packs
on
the
shelf
from
this
brewer
oh
well
they
cant
all
be
winners
anyone
who
enjoys
the
style
might
as
well
try
this
but
those
only
curious
about
the
exotic
ingredients
just
save
your
money
overall
i
did
think
this
was
quite
impressive
the
ingrediant
additions
really
shined
on
the
aroma
but
i
think
became
a
bit
buried
in
the
herbal
oily
and
sweet
character
on
the
palate
a
very
interesting
beer
though
and
it
is
well
proportioned
to
give
you
a
good
display
of
some
complex
flavours
and
remain
balanced
i
think
some
small
alterations
would
fix
some
of
the
balance
critiques
very
nice
awesome
example
of
a
bier
de
garde
i
wish
more
people
embraced
these
styles
musty
spicy
and
lemon
zest
come
through
very
crisp
with
high
carbonation
its
on
the
sweet
side
for
me
but
still
tasty
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
good
beer
and
good
example
of
the
style
it
had
most
of
the
aspects
that
i
look
for
in
the
style
while
still
being
fairly
unique
and
i
thought
that
made
this
beer
memorable
this
beer
had
good
drinkability
it
was
smooth
fairly
crisp
slightly
refreshing
a
little
dry
on
finish
not
filling
and
the
taste
did
a
nice
job
at
holding
my
attention
i
think
two
or
three
of
these
would
be
my
limit
its
pretty
easy
drinking
and
i
think
it
makes
for
a
nice
fall
time
beer
what
i
like
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
taste
aroma
and
drinkability
they
were
all
good
and
worked
well
with
this
beer
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
the
head
retention
but
in
the
end
it
wasnt
that
big
of
a
deal
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
when
in
the
mood
for
the
style
and
i
would
recommend
it
to
anyone
who
is
a
fan
of
the
style
all
in
all
i
was
happy
with
this
beer
it
was
just
a
nice
biere
de
garde
and
i
enjoyed
drinking
it
it
isnt
my
favorite
of
the
style
but
it
was
one
of
the
better
ones
ie
had
and
its
one
of
the
better
beers
ive
had

i
would
believe
it
if
someone
told
me
this
was
brewed
in
belgium
a
superb
crackery
light
malt
base
super
dry
with
a
little
hop
bite
to
round
things
out
this
is
a
fantastic

i
would
absolutely
love
to
have
another
sometime
very
soon
light
mouthfeel
the
appearance
and
aroma
sold
me
but
the
flavor
was
a
bit
disappointing
though
as
it
warms
up
the
flavor
slightly
comes
through
more
despite
all
that
its
lovely
stuff
i
like
everything
about
it
try
it
if
you
can
i
was
very
excited
for
this
ancient
grains
type
saison
with
all
these
botanicals
in
it
but
it
came
across
way
too
sweet
for
me
malty

not
quite
robust

define
the
nose
and
taste
of
this
beer
clearish

with
a

good
looks
so
much
sweetness
here
i
cant
really
get
any
of
the
botanicals
or
herbals
i
was
looking
most
forward
to
not
sure
what
the
spelt
or
rye
contribute
either
all
i
really
get
is
residual
sugar
light
like
honey
but
still
pervasive
feel
is
bogged
down
by
it
too
but
its
very
well
carbonated
some
may
enjoy
the
sweetness
i
dont
mean
to
make
it
sound
like
a
pure
sugar
bomb
because
its
a
lit
more
interesting
than
that
the
sugar
just
blocks
the
most
interesting
features
of
this
beer
for
me
overall
this
is
an
agreeable
saison
it
isnt
too
over
the
top
yet
the
addition
of
rye
and
spelt
grains
add
some
more
complex
flavours
and
aromas
to
this
brew
the
beer
has
a
nice
funky
smell
to
it
which
only
increases
as
the
beer
warms
up
to
room
temperature
this
is
an
ok
brew
it
is
pretty
yeasty
and
grainy
overall
an
ok
sweet
and
spicy
saison
a
tasty
enough
saison
amped
up
by
the
sidestepping
grain
and
mostly
hard
to
discern
floral
adjuncts
another
weird
and
limited
in
its
wonder
belgianinfluenced
ale
from
stillwater
i
grok
what
theyre
doing
as
a
gypsy
brewer
and
avid
promoter
of
their
local
culture
but
that
hardly
blows
my
skirt
up
up
here
so
between
that
and
the
um
beer
its
a
big
fwuh
and
if
not
that
meh
an
alright
saison
but
not
close
to
one
of
the
better
ones
from
stillwater
as
far
as
overall
drinkability
taste
goes
had
the
potential
for
greatness
o
another
complex
and
delicious
saison
from
stillwater
just
under
medium
body
lighter
effervescence
than
expected
lightly
drying
as
well
a
decent
saison
but
no
st

enjoyable

o

is
my
first
stillwater
offering
and
i
can
say
i
am
eager
to
try
more
aggressively
earthy
and
floral
with
hearty
wheat
spices
and
a
kiss
of
fruit
wonderfully
complex
and
well
blended
saison
what
a
great
introduction
to
stillwater
ales
not
my
favorite
from
stillwaterexistent
but
all
around
a
nicely
balanced
and
drinkable
beer

poured

with
a
super
large
foamy

with

easily
detectable
with

good
carbonation
and
no
apparent
alcohol
very
well
brewed
with
excellent
level
complexity
while
retaining
a
very
nice
level
of
drinkability
my
first
beer
from
stillwater
looks
nice
smells
nice
a
good
profile
of
flavors
but
not
really
pushing
it
or
trying
to
be
obnoxious
and
thats
the
key
i
think
do
it
right
and
do
it
well
but
dont
try
to
be
out
of
control
with
things
a
very
well
done
brew
o
sweeter
and
creamier
than
traditional
for
the
style
but
it
works
beautifully
poured
into
a
nostradamus
flute
glass
pours
a
medium

with
a
one

and
a

flavor
of

fruit
with
peppery
bitterness
from
the
heather
develops
nice
floral
notes
in
the
middle
to
finish
somewhat
dry
with
a
touch
of

sourness
a
very
pleasant
flavor
progression
complex
variety
of
flavors
but
none
dominate
allowing
something
interesting
to
develop
over
the
taste
although
light
to
medium
in
body
it
manages
a
bit
of
creaminess
in
the
mouth
feel
another
interesting
and
fun
to
drink
take
on
the
saison
style
nicely
done
o
like
everything
stillwater
makes
this
one
is
worth
a
shot
not
my
favorite
of
theirs
but
pretty
solid
overall
impression
a
decent
saison
by
stillwaterbrewers
art
but
not
worth
the
price
i
havent
seen
this
in
bottle
shops
yet
but
wont
be
looking
to
purchase
it
not
even
tasteflavor
for
me
the
spices
were
a
good
contribution
to
the
beer
but
needed
more
character
poured
ontap
and
served
in
a
tulip
the
beer
is
a
cloudy
opaque
pale
orange
marmalade
coloring
with
a
thin
filmy
coating
on
top
aromas
of
sweet
honey
and
a
blend
of
spicing
including
a
clove
presence
flavors
are
light
with
an
effervescent
feel
on
the
tongue
subtle
sweetness
in
the
backbone
carries
the
dynamic
spice
profile
of
nutmeg
clove
heather
and
oregano
on
a
smooth
body
the
aftertaste
is
a
muted
version
of
the
flavors
doing
a
good
job
of
carrying
the
major
profiles
over
into
the
end
of
the
palate
quick
clean
finish
with
a
touch
of
citrus
sweet
at
the
very
end
very
easy
to
drink
and
very
well
balanced
overall
this
another
winner
from
stillwater
i
dig
this
beer
oa
decent
saison
but
not
in
the
top
tier
o
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
a
bit
of
a
let
down
stillwater
makes
so
many
excellent
saisons
but
i
found
this
one
to
be
better
than
average
but
not
really
at
the
level
that
ive
come
to
expect
from
brians
saisons
enjoyable
on
a
warm
memorial
day
weekend
but
lacking
in
the
sweetness
to
be
the
perfect
beverage
for
right
now
probably
more
of
an
end
of
summer
beer
than
an
early
summer
beer
750ml
bottle
served
in
a
tulip
poured
a
hazy
gold
with
a
finger
of
white
head
floral
aroma
that
i
wasnt
really
a
fan
of
also
some
citrus
light
bodied
with
plenty
of
carbonation
nice
and
dry
with
some
belgian
spice
in
the
finish
more
citrus
in
the
flavor
taste
was
better
than
the
aroma
not
my
favorite
stillwater
appearance
is
a
hazy
orange
with
two
fingers
of
white
head
this
collaboration
from
stillwaterbrewers
art
has
a
a
smell
of
of
yeast
spice
honey
and
lemon
the
taste
is
grains
fruit
and
bread
mouthfeel
is
rather
earthy
a
musty
aspect
finishes
rather
clean
however
a
nice
farmhouse
that
has
a
bit
of
barnyard
character
to
it
but
not
too
much
was
easily
quaffable
and
would
be
great
way
to
introduce
newbies
to
the
style
overall
i
usually
love
stillwaters
saisons
but
this
one
has
too
many
funky
additions
too
much
spice
and
the
herbal
bitterness
is
too
much
still
good
but
not
great
o
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
and
is
an
interesting
representation
of
the
style
due
to
the
addition
of
flowers
and
herbs
o
this
beer
is
very
refreshing
and
very
easy
to
drink
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
it
is
one
to
get
another
time
this
beer
is
very
much
a
sessionable
beer
and
definitely
one
i
would
enjoy
drinking
through
an
entire
meal
my
only
real
critique
is
that
i
wish
there
was
a
little
more
dryness
in
the
mouthfeel
o
overall
a
nice
saison
but
not
my
favorite
stillwater
beer
a
bit
too
heavy
on
the
spices
for
me
if
you
like
spicepepper
in
your
saisons
you
may
like
this
more
then
i
did
but
i
probably
wouldnt
seek
it
out
again
overall
a
refreshing
brew
like
the
spice
cake
elements
while
i
enjoyed
this
beer
tremendously
after
tasting
the
debutante
and
a
fantome
in
the
same
weekend
i
also
found
myself
wondering
if
ive
hit
a
wall
in
terms
of
my
ability
to
detect
some
of
the
more
subtle
and
unique
variations
or
if
im
missing
out
on
some
things
the
nose
and
the
flavor
lean
a
bit
too
much
towards
the
fruity
and
floral
side
of
things
it
needs
more
spiciness
and
or
funkiness
to
balance
out
this
super
fruit
and
floral
character
that
is
on
show
so
well
in
this
beer
this
is
a
touch
unbalanced
but
in
the
end
is
pretty
tasty
actually
it
really
reminds
me
a
lot
of
a
saison
i
made
with
hibiscus
it
too
really
needed
some
balancing
funkiness
or
spiciness
in
it
i
wonder
if
the
standard
french
saison
yeast
was
used
in
here
i
find
that
this
yeast
doesnt
supply
the
bite
and
balance
that
my
favorite
saison
yeasts
are
able
to
supply
o
this
beer
was
nice
to
try
but
almost
tasted
like
a
juice
o
a
decent
saison
though
a
little
on
the
simplistic
and
watery
side
still
its
not
bad
overall
good
blend
of
flavors
categorically
crisp
and
no
more
alcohol
than
was
ever
needed
keeping
it
tasty
and
refreshing
even
in
late
december
overall
a
good
belgianstylesaison
very
crisp
and
refreshing
certainly
above
average
as
a
general
ale
but
i
dont
know
that
its
anything
particularly
special
in
the
genre
that
said
its
very
good
and
i
would
recommend
o
ok
not
the
best
but
not
the
worst
try
if
you
like
o
interesting
beer
seemed
strong
then
6
4
alcohol
and
tasted
more
like
at
tripel
i
enjoyed
it
either
way
but
seemed
off
for
the
style
the
aroma
was
loaded
with
spices
hints
of
lemon
and
cinnamon
where
abound
here
with
a
rich
earthy
mix
to
it
lots
of
almost
a
nutmeg
i
am
picking
up
here
the
flavor
took
off
right
where
that
left
off
a
rich
mixture
of
lemon
fresh
grass
light
fruit
flavors
and
a
ton
of
spice
nice
hints
of
allspice
cinnamon
and
pepper
here
nice
light
to
medium
body
feel
capped
it
off
very
well
and
the
overall
drinkability
was
very
nice
cheers
hv
this
brew
poured
out
with
a
nice
rising
white
head
and
a
cloudy
yellowish
gold
body
the
head
had
a
good
retention
but
the
lacing
wasnt
really
doing
much
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
grainy
and
didnt
really
have
to
much
of
a
farmhouse
aroma
to
me
the
taste
of
the
beer
had
some
light
spicy
notes
and
some
sweet
grainy
malts
that
was
pretty
tasty
i
thought
the
mouthfeel
was
light
and
well
carbonated
and
it
really
when
down
easy
overall
its
a
very
drinkable
beer
it
tasted
good
and
left
a
good
impression
on
me
i
would
more
than
likely
drink
this
one
again
not
bad
here
a
little
bit
much
going
on
but
tasty
either
way
probably
stick
with
some
of
their
other
offerings
in
the
future
though
crisp
in
the
mouth
a
mild
tartness
fairly
sweet
and
some
yeast
slightly
herbal
but
nothing
really
stands
out
for
me
kind
of
an
average
saison
not
super
interesting
stillwater
knocked
it
out
of
the
park
with
this
collaboration
it
was
very
worth
the
wait
and
im
going
back
for
more
beer
tastes
really
nice
i
like
it
a
lot
medium
in
body
sweet
on
the
front
end
and
throughout
is
a
nice
yeast
character
the
esters
make
a
nice
forward
palate
sweet
banana
mild
bubble
gum
the
finish
has
a
subtle
bitterness
that
i
really
enjoy
a
lot
overall
really
tasty
ale
for
the
style
and
i
could
easily
drink
these
all
night
long
i
wish
it
had
a
bit
more
of
that
funky
yeast
and
a
bit
less
sweetness
but
thats
just
my
opinion
and
its
not
like
its
going
to
stop
me
from
drinking
more
nice
beer
i
liked
how
the
spice
lingered
on
overall
the
fruity
notes
were
very
pleasant
and
the
flavor
was
quite
well
balanced
i
would
have
this
again
in
the
future
overall
a
different
take
if
you
are
looking
for
a
bretty
or
funky
sour
saison
this
isnt
it
but
i
like
the
other
qualities
of
this
brew
considerably
on
the
flipside
debutante
has
colors
consisting
of
burnt
orange
with
a
copper
tint
in
between
the
lines
darker
than
the
average
saison
no
head
or
even
a
skimpy
cap
just
some
straggled
popping
bubbles
no
lace
smell
is
pretty
dull
with
a
big
fruity
essense
kinda
artificial
some
small
toasted
malt
along
with
faded
pepper
not
all
that
pungent
or
good
for
that
matter
taste
is
not
any
better
the
main
taste
here
is
artificial
fruit
almost
cereal
like
whatever
yeasy
in
here
is
not
a
good
look
some
small
toasted
bready
malt
in
the
middle
rounding
out
to
some
grain
in
the
end
hops
are
not
in
the
picture
or
registering
with
me
feel
is
medium
with
not
a
whole
lot
of
activity
the
beer
is
far
from
dead
though
could
use
a
jump
start
not
my
favorite
from
stillwater
this
would
actually
be
my
least
favorite
i
could
not
even
stomach
my
glass
poured
on
tap
at
my
campsite
into
a
hollowed
out
pineapple
aroma
is
very
pineappley
haha
grainy
cat
piss
wet
grass
nice
hazy
burnt
orange
color
light
pepper
aroma
flavor
is
very
mild
nice
saison
a
little
more
body
than
most
drinking
this
at
a
campsite
from
a
hollowed
pineapple
overall
this
is
a
solid
saison
but
the
price
is
prohibitive
11
00
for
a
750
overall
a
great
saison
with
just
the
right
amount
of
floral
characteristics
one
of
the
beat
beers
stillwater
has
done
imo
o
not
too
bad
i
still
prefer
some
of
their
other
saisons
but
this
one
was
still
ver
good
glad
i
got
to
try
it
thanks
again
josh
d
very
drinkable
the
spices
here
were
very
complex
and
a
bit
different
compared
to
most
saisons
however
they
wound
up
being
well
balanced
and
worked
very
well
to
deliver
a
great
saison
a
wellmade
american
saison
m
the
mouthfeel
is
very
lively
packed
with
more
flavors
than
most
saisons
put
together
the
dusty
flavors
segue
nicely
into
a
formidable
saison
body
hops
near
the
finish
seal
the
deal
with
citrusy
zest
well
done
id
say
its
just
a
hair
behind
cellar
door
and
stateside
o
its
a
very
light
and
drinkable
beer
perfect
for
a
nice
hot
day
its
not
quite
what
i
expected
i
love
the
start
but
the
finish
falls
a
little
quickly
overall
though
it
is
a
nice
easygoing
one
i
would
drink
it
again
taste
is
as
unique
as
the
nose
very
sharp
and
crisp
with
a
unique
tart
and
bready
yeast
flavor
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
full
very
rich
and
a
bit
bitter
overall
its
very
good
and
somehow
very
different
o
though
ive
liked
some
of
the
stillwater
saison
this
was
a
bit
too
estery
for
me
o
an
enjoyable
effort
though
i
didnt
find
it
as
drinkable
as
i
thought
it
should
be
jd
this
saison
has
a
lot
of
yeast
driving
the
flavor
the
presence
is
full
on
with
mild
wheat
flavors
which
come
off
as
lightly
bready
and
fresh
toasted
with
slight
pear
and
light
funkiness
giving
an
earthy
flavor
from
the
yeast
the
hops
give
a
light
herbal
accent
bringing
out
some
complexity
in
the
spice
additions
and
the
mild
bitterness
helps
to
lighten
the
taste
a
bit
the
toasted
wheat
presence
is
high
perhaps
there
is
some
oat
in
the
malt
too
since
it
is
so
silky
smooth
with
creamy
yeast
element
in
the
finish
overall
i
found
this
to
be
a
very
high
quality
and
quaffable
saison
the
spice
notes
are
not
out
of
place
and
the
collaboration
is
nothing
short
of
excellent
which
you
would
expect
from
two
american
brewers
who
know
their
way
around
the
belgian
styles
a
great
example
of
what
can
happen
when
inspiration
ignites
between
a
couple
brewers
very
nice
take
on
the
style
this
was
better
on
tap
as
so
many
beers
usually
are
this
isnt
really
an
off
putting
beer
its
just
weird
at
times
and
there
isnt
anything
there
to
make
up
for
its
strangeness
nothing
extraordinairy
here
but
a
solid
effort
nonetheless
interesting
saison
the
spelt
and
rye
are
pretty
prominent
not
sure
how
much
i
liked
the
spelt
added
a
strong
cereal
graininess
that
i
didnt
care
for
not
one
of
stillwaters
better
efforts
but
not
bad
either
o
a
good
saison
from
two
home
state
brewers
but
there
are
many
better
ones
i
would
search
out
first
overall
the
nose
carries
the
flavor
profile
and
the
head
and
mouthfeel
left
something
to
be
desired
but
id
have
another
one
pours
a
mostlyclear
light
orangeish
color
with
a
1
5finger
white
head
and
some
good
spotty
lacing
on
the
way
down
the
nose
carries
quite
a
bit
of
saison
yeast
and
accompanying
spice
plus
a
little
bit
of
citrus
and
light
malt
flavor
has
a
touch
of
malt
as
the
backing
plus
spice
and
citrus
light
pepper
and
herbs
throughout
light
to
medium
body
with
good
carbonation
nice
brew
but
not
my
favorite
from
stillwater
still
definitely
worth
a
try
o
this
is
another
great
saison
from
stillwater
this
is
definitely
a
unique
saison
worth
trying
i
am
glad
that
i
have
another
bottle
to
later
proper
looking
with
a
kind
of
an
offorange
color
and
a
white
head
nose
reminds
me
of
wildflowers
lemon
herbs
lemony
rye
seed
if
there
was
such
a
thing
rye
spelt
lemongrass
and
carries
a
buckwheatysoba
umaminess
that
i
cant
describe
along
with
a
faint
fruitiness
great
malty
base
that
amplifies
and
harmonizes
with
the
spice
which
also
seems
to
harmonize
with
the
phenols
blurring
the
line
that
seperates
spice
from
yeast
at
work
to
create
a
new
melody
such
a
familiar
taste
yet
like
nothing
ive
tasted
before
well
done
my
friends
dry
spicy
balanced
and
pleasant
not
a
trace
of
booze
the
spice
never
becomes
overbearing
and
there
even
is
a
touch
of
bitter
in
the
end
to
zip
it
up
medium
body
with
a
soft
feel
wonderful
a
bit
adventurous
but
in
a
gentle
way
another
winner
from
our
local
heroes
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
but
it
was
nothing
to
write
home
about
worth
a
shot
for
the
saisonlovers
out
there
this
is
a
good
beer
to
give
someones
whos
curious
about
the
style
and
you
dont
want
to
scare
them
away
with
something
overpowering
or
terribly
funky
very
solid
and
perfect
for
this
time
of
year
overall
not
a
terrible
beer
but
not
one
id
order
again
the
cpj
poured
into
a
pint
glass
a
cloudy
bronze
with
a
foamy
white
head
that
lingered
through
about
half
of
the
drinking
session
big
aroma
of
belgian
yeast
hay
orange
banana
taste
is
almost
like
a
dubbel
following
the
smell
a
lot
with
bready
belgian
yeast
up
front
hay
grass
moss
wildflowers
orange
zest
and
banana
peel
mild
peppery
spice
medium
mouthfeel
pretty
drinkable
but
a
little
too
much
of
the
yeasty
dubbel
taste
for
me
which
im
learning
more
and
more
i
have
to
be
in
the
mood
for
to
enjoy
i
adore
this
beer
its
better
than
hennepin
better
than
any
farmhouse
or
saison
ive
ever
had
a
true
original
you
have
to
try
this
at
all
costs
not
very
enjoyable
had
a
hard
time
finishing
my
glass
didnt
taste
like
the
style
should
taste
like
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
cloudy
beige
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
dark
fruits
malts
taste
is
fruity
spices
surprising
amount
of
alcohol
considering
the
abv
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
an
interesting
take
on
the
style
and
a
good
beer
o
not
great
but
bettter
than
acceptable
pours
a
clear
brass
color
with
a
full
half
finger
head
that
fades
pretty
quickly
some
bready
malts
and
grassyleafy
hops
in
the
nosesome
mild
nuttiness
is
detected
as
well
not
a
flavor
packed
beer
but
there
is
some
lighter
yeasty
notes
along
with
some
bready
malts
with
a
light
caramel
note
pretty
tame
but
it
goes
down
well
with
food
o
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
decent
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
decent
beer
to
drink
for
a
while
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
the
style
overall
a
good
midbodied
biere
de
garde
this
finishes
lighter
and
more
crisp
than
others
of
this
style
mildly
sweet
flavor
with
a
slightly
bitter
finish
creamy
and
smooth
didnt
blow
me
away
but
i
enjoyed
it
enough
really
enjoyable
filled
with
tropical
fruits
and
apples
maybe
not
the
truest
to
the
style
but
certainly
one
i
would
revisit
o
really
enjoyable
great
summer
beer
glad
it
made
its
way
up
to
new
england
a
training
wheels
version
of
the
style
not
sure
if
freshness
will
really
improve
this
alright
to
drink
but
a
one
done
me
thinks
overall
not
really
a
brew
i
care
for
glad
to
have
tried
it
o
a
decent
biere
de
garde
would
go
well
with
crawfish
pours
to
a
rich
off
white
head
and
copper
brown
color
aroma
is
toasty
biscuits
and
chocolate
malt
some
spicy
hops
in
aroma
as
well
flavor
is
rich
and
complex
with
bourbon
vanilla
chocolate
toast
cookies
alcohol
and
a
spicy
hop
zing
mouthfeel
is
light
medium
overall
very
tasty
and
technically
clean
but
it
misses
the
mark
in
terms
of
belgiannessfrenchness
dont
expect
to
revisit
this
one
and
still
waiting
to
be
impressed
by
bayou
teche
mediumfull
on
the
palate
its
buttery
richess
provides
a
sense
of
fullness
and
without
distraction
instead
a
smooth
transition
to
semidry
warmth
and
balanced
strawlike
bitterness
gives
the
beer
is
refreshing
citrusy
qualities
though
i
rather
liked
the
beer
as
a
nondescript
belgainesque
ale
it
is
timid
in
its
funkyfresh
farmhouse
qualities
taste
is
a
nice
nutty
malty
punch
backed
by
bitter
herb
then
flowing
into
a
slight
sour
yeast
finish
finishes
dry
this
is
a
good
beer
easy
drinking
and
tasty
i
did
not
detect
anything
that
screamed
biere
de
garde
drank
more
like
a
mild
bock
rjt
poured
into
a
goblet
pours
clear
copper
with
a
thin
quickly
dissipating
white
head
and
numerous
tiny
bubbles
coming
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
and
clinging
to
the
side
of
the
glass
the
beer
smells
sweet
and
bready
theres
just
a
touch
of
citrus
from
the
hops
the
flavor
is
bready
from
the
malt
with
some
hop
bitterness
in
the
background
theres
just
a
little
bit
of
citrus
back
there
its
a
little
earthy
its
an
interesting
flavor
the
body
is
light
with
strong
carbonation
the
finish
is
clean
and
dry
the
drinkability
is
high
this
is
a
good
beer
atmosphere
is
okay
nothing
special
in
terms
of
appearance
and
nose
is
very
light
all
flavor
components
are
lightly
applied
the
bitterness
however
comes
out
clearly
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
quaff
here
is
the
thing
if
you
compare
to
how
a
biere
de
garde
should
be
it
svery
close
to
the
description
of
the
style
however
its
not
all
that
amazing
maybe
its
because
i
havent
had
many
of
the
style
but
its
just
an
ordinary
malty
brew
to
me
drinkable
but
not
amazing
i
guess
just
slightly
above
average
to
me
mediumthick
bodied
viscous
its
pretty
drinkable
and
its
a
pretty
decent
beer
all
around
pours
the
color
and
clarity
of
cider
nose
expresses
cider
vinegar
and
vanilla
notes
taste
consistent
with
nose
but
it
comes
off
a
bit
watereddown
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
in

with
an
even
carbonation
and
a

all
and
all
a

but
a

i

oanother
great
beer
from
hf
what
can
i
say
overall
i
have
only
tried
a
handful
of
beers
from
the
beire
de
garde
family
of
beer
styles
aging
this
style
in
a
wine
barrel
is
a
great
idea
it
compliments
the
beer
style
very
nicely
this
is
the
best
that
i
have
had
out
of
all
the
biere
de
garde
beers
so
far
again
another
beer
that
is
excuted
so
well
by
s
hill
o
a
terrific
brew
that
manages
to
straddle
the
world
of
wine
and
beer
tangy
dry
tart
and
just
a
hint
of
wild
sour
yeasts
are
bold
and
unapologetic
notable
how
the
head
holds
strong
on
the
brew
from
start
to
finish
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
it
is
a
decent
brew
with
quite
a
unique
overall
feel
i
say
this
brew
is
mediocre
at
best
than
i
think
about
the
biere
de
garde
style
as
a
whole
and
cannot
think
of
any
true
standouts
for
the
style
id
say
this
is
well
beyond
average
id
drink
it
again
if
offered
but
id
never
attempt
to
trade
for
one
considering
what
hf
beers
command
it
didnt
floor
me
like
it
seemed
to
have
done
for
the
majority
but
definitely
quite
good
biere
de
garde
base
funkified
with
a
good
amount
of
unique
flavors
biere
de
garde
that
strikes
a
great
balance
between
tart
fruits
brett
funk
without
overpowering
oak
fermentation
byproducts
and
souring
bacteria
a
damn
fine
brew
that
brings
on
some
insane
complexity
o
this
is
a
great
biere
de
garde
one
of
shauns
better
creations
not
flora
level
but
its
excellent
amazing
how
much
the
wild
yeast
reminds
me
of
brett
this
is
incredible
beer
o
funky
sour
and
dry
with
some
orchard
fruit
flavors
o
really
good
flavor
easy
to
drink
and
smooth
i
would
have
liked
it
drier
but
i
wouldnt
turn
down
another
glass
of
this
thanks
again
kevin
the
beer
pours
out
a
dark
copperamber
color
with
a
tiny
scrim
of
caramelwhite
bubbles
that
mellow
into
a
nice
ring
around
the
glass
in
body
the
beer
is
nearly
a
uniform
color
throughout
with
a
rich
opacity
on
the
nose
this
beer
reeks
of
beautiful
funk
lemonlime
and
horse
blanket
tango
on
the
nostrils
alongside
nuances
of
pineapple
leather
cherry
pie
and
deep
barnyard
scents
what
a
beautiful
nose
on
this
beer
on
the
tongue
the
beer
tastes
of
a
wonderfully
balanced
tartness
alongside
a
smooth
malt
sweetness
and
just
a
kiss
of
herbal
and
spicy
hop
bitters
at
the
back
and
finish
as
the
beer
warms
a
smooth
and
syrupy
sweetness
also
starts
to
blanket
the
tongue
throughout
the
sip
further
pressing
a
nice
balance
throughout
the
beer
in
flavor
the
beer
begins
as
pineapple
juice
and
light
caramel
slowly
working
its
way
to
sweet
barnyard
and
horse
blanket
the
finish
blends
horse
blanket
caramel
malt
pineapple
juice
herbal
hay
and
grass
notes
onto
the
tongue
soft
touches
of
pine
and
this
delicious
yet
unplaceable
sweetness
splash
over
the
back
of
the
palate
the
aftertaste
is
a
delicious
blend
of
caramel
and
funk
almost
like
a
softly
candied
funk
in
the
mouth
the
beer
is
on
the
light
side
of
medium
with
a
soft
carbonation
and
a
mouthfeel
that
is
smooth
and
slightly
syrupy
overall
this
is
delicious
and
a
perfect
candidate
for
aging
the
funk
will
only
get
better
sometimes
i
want
to
dislike
hill
farmsteads
beer
but
i
never
can
this
beer
is
great
pours
a
nice
brownamber
with
a
thin
head
some
bubbles
on
the
side
some
decent
lacing
smells
is
very
sour
and
a
lot
like
wine
some
oak
dark
fruits
funk
the
taste
is
sour
but
not
as
sour
as
i
thought
it
might
be
perfect
theres
a
very
soft
mouthfeel
and
its
really
smooth
theres
some
funk
oak
wine
sour
cherry
just
enough
carbonation
to
feel
it
on
the
tongue
fairly
light
and
refreshing
really
nice
a
wonderful
funky
wild
ale
tons
of
complexity
and
the
funk
notes
remind
one
of
cantillons
character
overall
this
is
the
best
biere
de
garde
or
saison
for
that
matter
that
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
enjoying
the
oak
aging
on
this
is
what
elevates
it
and
even
though
there
are
plenty
of
other
great
producers
of
the
style
like
jolly
pumpkin
crooked
stave
logsdon
and
prairie
to
name
a
few
hf
nails
it
with
norma
looking
forward
to
snagging
another
bottle
of
this
worldclass
this
is
what
it
means
to
be
world
class
doing
something
no
one
else
does
and
something
really
really
worth
doing
and
worth
sharing
excellent
o
funky
and
dry
with
some
orchard
fruit
flavors
overall
a
beer
that
is
greater
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
simple
flavors
put
together
very
well
tart
citrus
upfront
finishes
dry
with
some
light
woody
spice
and
lightly
bitter
tannins
medium
body
crisp
feel
with
ample
creamy
carbonation
light
sweetness
in
the
middle
overall
pretty
straightforward
and
not
far
off
from
hfs
other
wild
and
sour
beers
placed
in
a
cellar
for
five
months
opened
last
night
pours
a
garnet
red

smells
a

but
not
overbearing
medium

very
dry
crisp
all
the
way
through
shared
with
a
lovely
gal
who
loved
it
when
i
asked
why
she
said
maybe
cuz
it
reminded
her
of
a
hard
cider
for
what
thats
worth
a
magnificently
balanced
and
crafted
beer
with
a
ton
of
nuances
that
only
hill
farmstead
could
pull
off
delicate
nose
flavor
and
feel
pull
this
one
together
just
right
that
being
said
sometimes
i
want
a
little
bit
more
distinctness
and
oomph
to
my
beers
still
this
is
no
question
an
excellent
brew
and
well
worth
seeking
out
o
awesome
i
have
only
had
a
few
beers
in
this
style
but
this
is
as
good
or
better
than
any
i
tried
i
think
the
amount
of
tartness
spritzy
carbonation
and
unique
house
yeast
separate
this
from
the
rest
and
make
for
a
very
complex
and
refreshing
brew
o
what
a
treat
i
can
imagine
this
aging
well
in
the
bottle
excellent
departure
from
the
style
unique
flavorful
and
delicious
o
ery
unique
and
amazing
o
yup
amazing
why
did
i
ever
doubt
it
well
probably
because
biere
de
mars
usually
isnt
my
go
to
style
but
this
definitely
stands
out
from
everyone
ive
ever
had
a
little
of
their
saison
style
comes
through
as
well
which
i
find
in
some
of
their
beers
like
abner
and
wheat
is
the
new
hops
this
is
exactly
what
i
love
about
hf
their
well
water
also
might
have
something
to
do
with
their
outstanding
brews
next
time
i
go
up
there
im
totally
asking
them
to
fill
a
growler
with
their
water
haha
oanother
very
nice
offering
from
hf
very
complex
beer
that
offers
a
wonderful
blend
of
flavors
that
truly
develop
during
tasting
o
this
was
another
great
beer
from
hf
but
i
wouldnt
say
i
was
blown
away
by
it
it
was
slightly
different
then
i
was
expecting
having
a
slightly
sweeter
and
less
tart
presence
then
i
was
expecting
ive
only
had
a
few
biere
de
gardes
as
i
wouldnt
say
its
a
style
that
is
brewed
a
lot
but
this
is
easily
the
best
of
the
style
ive
had
and
perhaps
one
of
the
best
representations
of
the
style
out
there
that
being
said
i
wouldnt
say
i
enjoyed
this
that
much
more
then
shauns
more
common
offerings
such
as
anna
arthur
etc
i
highly
recommend
checking
it
out
though
and
im
sure
youll
enjoy
it
pours
a
clear
dark
orange
with
a
foamy
bone
colored
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
tiny
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
sour
and
tart
with
fruit
acidic
and
wood
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
fruit
and
grain
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
medium
amount
of
acidity
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
with
some
great
aromas
and
flavors
that
make
this
beer
super
easy
to
drink
o
another
hit
by
hf
the
hype
behind
this
is
not
a
let
down
would
like
to
see
how
age
affects
this
o
a
very
nice
beer
the
dry
vinous
oaky
flavors
and
the
fruity
brett
are
really
nice
the
flavors
are
complex
but
very
subtle
awesome
stuff
overall
overall
i
would
rank
this
second
only
to
juicy
in
the
hf
lineup
o
barrel
touch
adds
to
the
biere
de
mars
style
complex
offering
from
a
talented
craftsmen
team
the
offering
is
a
challenge
and
a
pleasure
what
a
treasure
this
is
this
poured
out
as
a
deep
amber
color
the
head
was
white
and
foamy
the
retention
was
good
and
the
lacing
was
decent
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
huge
with
fresh
oak
very
wooden
and
kind
of
funky
the
aroma
was
quite
impressive
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
malty
but
has
a
softer
oak
flavor
that
i
expected
it
to
have
judging
by
how
strong
the
aroma
is
there
is
a
bit
of
light
caramel
in
the
aftertaste
also
the
mouthfeel
medium
bodied
with
a
big
amount
of
carbonation
the
beer
finishes
on
he
dry
side
with
a
tart
sting
in
the
back
of
the
tongue
overall
this
beer
is
very
nice
really
impressive
stuff
o
the
first
half
of
the
glass
left
me
a
bit
underwhelmed
the
more
i
thought
about
the
beer
the
more
i
liked
it
though
its
incredibly
complex
and
unique
super
tart
with
a
perfectly
clean
finish
it
drinks
way
too
easily
certainly
worth
the
effort
to
get
a
bottle
in
person
heavy
on
the
wine
barrel
which
brings
an
interesting
tamarind
and
currant
quality
plenty
of
barnyard
funkiness
too
feels
pretty
big
good
flavors
but
a
bit
heavy
on
the
palate
acidity
is
moderate
finishes
with
lingering
tamarind
and
red
wine
flavors
pretty
damn
good
one
of
the
better
farmhouse
ales
from
hill
farmstead
overall
norma
is
a
great
rustic
ale
and
i
could
imagine
drinking
it
on
some
small
farm
in
the
middle
of
nowhere
with
fresh
bread
and
homemade
cheese
i
do
however
think
it
is
one
of
those
beers
that
would
have
escaped
notice
had
it
not
come
from
hf
overall
wow
not
only
was
this
beer
phenomenal
but
everything
about
having
it
was
perfect
a
really
clean
and
rustic
beer
and
borderline
a
wild
ale
i
would
rate
this
just
below
flora
for
taste
thanks
again
shaun
dan
phil
and
bob
at
hf
for
sharing
huge
huge
thanks
to
yourefragile

sharing
this
beer
served
in
a
hill
farmstead
wine
glass
pours
a
light
reddishbrown
color
with
a
short
tan
head
good
retention
and
a
good
bit
of
lacing
throughout
the
nose
carries
some
typical
biere
de
garde
character
with
some
semisweet
malt
and
a
touch
of
bread
followed
up
with
a
nice
oak
component
also
there
is
a
bit
of
cherry
alongside
some
faint
acidity
the
acid
component
grows
through
the
flavor
leading
the
way
to
an
exquisite
mouthfeel
dry
tart
and
a
nice
bit
of
oak
even
after
just
having
ann
this
was
a
beautiful
beer
and
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
had
in
a
long
time
a
great
take
on
the
biere
de
garde
style
without
being
in
name
only
pour
is
orangish
red
with
an
off
white
head
leaving
a
decent
lace
nose
is
heavy
red
wine
juicy
dark
grape
notes
of
oak
very
rustic
and
pleasant
taste
is
a
bit
muted
the
red
wine
is
there
but
the
finish
is
a
touch
empty
more
brett
but
not
pronounced
leathery
and
dusty
body
is
light
assertive
carbonation
and
a
touch
of
dryness
to
it
a
very
nice
beer
delicate
and
complex
with
hints
of
oak
esters
yeast
mild
funk
sweetness
as
well
an
overall
great
beer
and
id
have
it
again
o
a
fantastic
beer
from
hf
as
usual
this
has
developed
some
serious
fruit
notes
and
is
starting
to
get
a
bit
more
sour
mike
pours
a
generally
clear
ruby
brown
with
a
large
off
white
head
long
retention
and
sticky
thick
lacing
nose
is
a
complex
blend
of
sweet
bread
malt
woodsy
and
earthy
oak
vanilla
and
yeasty
spice
flavor
is
more
of
the
same
as
the
nose
funky
and
earthy
spicy
yeast
and
oak
mild
vanilla
and
malt
sweetness
medium
thick
body
prickly
carbonation
mild
tartness
in
the
finish
just
wow
as
nice
as
ann
was
this
was
the
standout
for
me
edit
early
sample
of
the
2012
batch
was
equally
special
with
a
little
more
barrel
port
like
and
fruit
presence
than
i
remembered
from
the
2011
bottle
another
winner
from
shaun
and
hill
farmstead
more
confirmation
that
hf
is
one
of
the
best
breweries
on
the
planet
bottle
hazy
dark
gold
pour
with
white
head
very
pretty
almost
glowing
orange
aroma
has
some
brett
peach
lots
of
oak
vanilla
light
buttery
aroma
honey
taste
like
tdd
dulcis
grape
peel
honey
grain
butter
vanilla
very
tasty
not
really
sour
but
has
a
nice
funk
and
a
tart
citric
finish
palate
is
well
carbed
and
full
bodied
delicious
o
this
is
more
wild
then
bière
de
garde
no
doubt
one
of
my
favorite
beers
that
ive
had
from
hf
and
ive
had
most
all
of
them
i
have
one
bottle
left
that
im
going
to
cellar
for
a
year
or
so
and
revisit
hopefully
ill
run
into
another
during
that
time
recommend
d
shauns
barrelaging
prowess
and
spontaneous
culture
have
transformed
a
style
i
dont
generally
love
into
a
very
enjoyable
experience
the
oaky
earthy
and
vinous
notes
balance
out
the
malt
character
of
the
base
quite
nicely
that
being
said
its
not
a
beer
id
crave
often
this
may
be
too
sophisticated
for
my
palate
overall
awesome
i
would
call
this
an
american
wild
over
biere
de
garde
or
saison
but
delicious
great
wild
funk
sour
fruit
saison
like
malts
hunts
of
barrel
light
biter
hops
late
in
the
finish
and
delicious
delicious
lacto
o
overall
this
beer
was
one
of
the
hardest
ive
had
to
review
it
transcends
styles
and
is
so
damn
lacto
its
just
delicious
really
outstanding
all
areas
of
lacto
in
this
with
wild
ale
style
funk
and
tartness
really
enjoyable
beer
like
nothing
ive
ever
had
before
and
will
probably
never
have
again
b
there
is
some
residual
brandy
hanging
out
with
wood
and
vanilla
musty
earthy
lightly
sour
and
raisiny
light
bodied
and
presents
some
slight
warming
grassy
crisp
apple
sour
cherries
pours
a
cloudy
brownish
orange
color
with
offwhite
head
funk
tartness
earth
tones
and
maple
notes
on
the
nose
follows
onto
the
palate
i
also
get
some
maplebrown
sugar
sweetness
in
the
middle
with
a
distinct
bready
note
undoubtedly
from
the
hay
finishes
tart
and
dry
with
jester
king
funk
interesting
classic
tartness
with
slight
resiny
sourness
that
lingers
on
the
palate
very
good
draft
at
jk
tart
not
much
hay
nice
finish
with
notes
of
brandy
very
well
balanced
sour
this
is
a
really
outstanding
beer
i
think
that
the
hay
and
the
term
biere
de
garde
to
some
might
be
considered
more
offputting
than
a
beiber
concert
but
dont
let
that
fool
you
friends
this
angel
indisquise
is
that
newnew
that
is
onpar
with
some
of
jks
finer
offerings
like
a
newlywed
admiring
his
beautiful
spouse
im
interested
to
see
how
time
will
change
this
masterpiece
get
some
this
was
a
tough
one
to
characterize
unlike
some
reviews
i
get
the
hay
upfront
in
a
very
earthy
dry
sort
of
way
dried
grass
shocker
it
doesnt
linger
and
its
not
overpowering
the
barrel
comes
through
in
the
form
of
sweetness
cranberryraspberry
this
beer
surprised
me
i
really
enjoyed
it
overall
pleasantly
surprised
as
i
often
am
with
these
less
conventional
beers
it
reminds
me
of
encendia
in
flavor
profile
and
such
particularly
with
that
earthy
malty
finish
maybe
somewhere
between
encendia
and
ambree
b2
id
also
like
to
commend
jester
king
for
consistently
being
able
to
brew
dark
sours
even
one
like
this
with
balsamic
notes
and
being
able
to
avoid
acetic
acid
getting
involved
theyre
masters
of
the
craft
o
a
very
sweet
beer
with
a
strong
floral
flavor
decent
but
not
something
i
would
seek
out
o
a
nice
lighter
beer
that
would
be
great
in
a
summer
day
i
felt
that
it
was
a
little
to
carbonated
but
it
still
was
enjoyable
this
falls
flat
on
several
levels
if
it
rose
above
mediocre
on
any
of
them
i
might
be
more
forgiving
but
this
is
a
dull
flat
untasty
beer
that
im
going
to
have
trouble
downing
half
a
can
of
borderline
bad
thanks
to
the
legendary
woodychandler
for
keeping
me
stocked
with
new
and
exciting
beers
poured
from
a
16
oz
can
has
a
rich
golden
color
with
a
1
inch
head
smell
is
mild
a
bit
of
honey
taste
is
also
mild
a
bit
bland
even
some
floral
notes
a
bit
of
honey
no
bad
but
light
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
an
easy
drinking
and
decent
beer
o
this
is
a
sweet
floral
beer
it
is
refreshing
on
a
warm
day
i
wish
there
was
more
spiciness
from
the
yeast
mouthfeel
is
great
nice
crisp
fruity
feel
with
a
little
stickiness
and
good
carbonation
overall
well
crafted
belgian
beer
good
change
up
from
all
the
hoppiness
that
is
more
characteristic
of
summer
the
crack
released
a
good
bit
of
effervescent
beer
and
i
waited
for
things
to
settle
before
cantinuing
my
subsequent
glug
produced
two
fingers
of
rocky
tawny
head
with
decent
retention
color

deepamber
with
nequality
clarity
nose
was
slightly
musty
with
a
honey
sweetness
underlying
mouthfeel
was
on
the
watery
side
with
a
light
fruitiness
on
the
tongue
they
mentioned
apricot
and
nectarine
on
the
can
and
i
got
the
soft
fruitiness
but
i
am
unsure
that
i
would
havecould
have
identified
those
particular
flavors
finish
was
semidry
and
the
yeast
gave
it
a
musty
dustiness
i
shared
it
with
the
queen
bee
inside
of
her
hive
and
that
made
it
worthwhile
it
was
not
a
terribly
impressive
beer
and
had
i
cansumed
it
by
myself
i
might
have
been
really
disappointed

theres

at

theres
a

sour
flavor
this
doesnt
have
nearly
as
much
of
that
as
youd
expect
in
a
described
sour
beer
but
it
has
a
nice
character

it
aftertaste

appleistic
yes
i
made
that
up
with
malt
not
the
best
of
the
few
bdgs
ive
had
but
its
still
a
tasty
beer
for
sure
o
not
bad
bug

not
getting

is
a

ale
well
balanced

nice

very
smooth
to
drink
very
enjoyable
offering
well
done
the
carbontion
is
quite
low
especially
for
a
belgian
style
this
puts
the
body
into
the
upper
midrange
even
though
it
is
not
a
sweet
beer
by
any
means
i
had
5
or
6
creative
but
average
beers
at
vivants
ridiculously
awesome
brewery
and
this
one
takes
the
cake
i
think
higher
co2
and
more
yeasty
belgian
phenolics
would
take
this
to
another
level
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
good
beer
i
wouldnt
really
call
it
a
biere
de
garde
but
i
would
say
that
it
is
a
good
example
of
a
honey
ale
the
honey
stuck
out
the
most
and
the
malts
and
hops
backed
it
up
nicely
and
provided
good
balance
this
beer
had
ok
drinkability
it
was
pretty
smooth
and
the
flavor
held
my
attention
but
i
think
one
would
be
enough
for
me
what
i
liked
most
about
this
beer
was
the
taste
i
liked
how
great
the
nice
honey
flavors
contrasted
with
the
malts
and
hops
it
had
great
balance
and
the
mouthfeel
was
also
noteworthy
what
i
liked
least
about
this
beer
was
the
aroma
it
wasnt
bad
and
i
didnt
mind
the
tart
and
funky
yeast
but
it
just
didnt
come
together
as
well
as
it
could
have
i
might
buy
one
more
can
of
this
years
release
but
its
a
little
expensive
so
theres
a
good
chance
i
wont
be
having
it
till
next
time
they
release
it
i
do
recommend
giving
it
a
try
especially
if
you
are
a
fan
of
honey
ales
all
in
all
this
was
a
good
and
solid
beer
it
wasnt
everything
that
i
expected
it
to
be
but
it
all
ended
up
coming
together
nicely
good
job
brewery
vivant
im
on
board
for
the
next
special
release
its
one
kick
ass
series
i
like
this
beer
but
it
is
not
something
i
would
seek
out
dont
think
i
would
have
identified
the
honey
in
it
as
a
major
component
m
light
to
medium
body
light
carbonation
d
the
complexities
are
quite
interesting
i
had
a
couple
of
glasses
during
my
visit
and
i
wouldnt
mind
having
more
i
dont
know
that
this
beer
really
fits
the
biere
de
garde
category
though
i
dont
quite
know
where
id
put
it
the
beer
it
most
reminded
me
of
was
trois
pistoles
by
unibroue
with
strong
peppery
qualities
while
not
as
potent
maybe
its
more
of
a
belgian
dark
ale
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
the
drinkability
is
easy
honey
used
during
brewing
adds
some
noticeable
effects
in
the
body
and
consistency
of
the
ale
this
is
a
tasty
brew
that
is
fit
for
sessioning
the
style
may
be
considered
as
something
different
but
currently
the
reviewer
is
unsure
as
to
which
categorization
fits
best
this
beer
is
astounding
highly
recommend
can
be
found
in
eastern
france
and
luxembourg
overall
this
is
my
first
biére
de
garde
and
i
have
to
say
i
am
quite
a
fan
plenty
of
different
flavours
combined
to
make
a
quite
interesting
style
refreshing
like
a
german
pilsner
and
yet
with
belgian
farmyard
qualities
also
ill
definitely
have
another
of
these
at
au12
for
a
750ml
bottle
o
good
bier

hard
to
classify
though
almost

im
amazed
at
how
well
the
8
5
abv
is
masked
i
have
never
had
as
a
carbonated
beer
noting
it
is
top
fermented
almost
like
champagne
a
very
good
beer
really
nice
well
worth
a
trip
overall
it
is
refreshing
as
a
brew
esp
after
drinking
so
many
ipas
lately
i
passed
my
glass
around
and
it
was
a
crowd
pleaser
personally
it
was
a
little
sharp
in
heat
and
acid
with
not
enough
esters
to
mellow
out
the
flavor
of
the
malt
and
coriander
still
as
i
said
the
others
in
the
room
gave
it
higher
marks
than
i
pours
out
a
bright
gold
with
a
foamy
white
head
nose
is
bready
crackery
grainy
with
soft
fruited
yeast
and
a
bit
of
floral
hops
flavor
is
overall
sweet
and
richly
malty
up
front
bready
honeyed
malts
with
floral
noble
hops
slight
acidity
and
dryness
in
the
finish
make
if
refreshing
in
spite
of
the
initial
richness
mouthfeel
is
moderate
in
weight
with
a
prickly
strong
carbonation
which
works
so
well
with
the
flavor
profile
pretty
good
stuff
i
needed
to
go
to
youtube
for
help
opening
the
bottle
ive
never
encountered
a
staple
holding
down
a
champagne
style
cork
in
a
bottle
of
beer
once
i
past
that
hurdle
using
a
flat
head
screw
driver
as
a
wedge
to
remove
the
staple
and
a
little
luck
removing
the
cork
barefooted
get
the
joke
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
at
how
much
the
taste
of
this
fine
brew
grew
on
me
until
the
next
morning
when
i
awoke
to
go
to
work
and
couldnt
remember
who
won
the
football
game
id
been
watching
after
a
quick
google
search
i
discovered
it
was
the
ne
patriots
on
top
and
this
close
to
addicting
beer
on
top
too
in
other
words
this
is
one
incredible
beer
o
interesting
complex
refreshing
well
balanced
and
delicious
very
well
done
o
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
tastes
like
a
hybrid
between
a
beer
and
a
hard
apple
cider
it
seems
like
it
would
be
a
perfect
accompaniment
to
a
dinner
with
mild
flavored
meat
such
as
poultry
it
isnt
overtly
complex
in
any
way
but
its
a
solid
farmhouse
ale
as
a
supermarket
beer
in
france
you
can
have
for
pocket
change
2
50
75cl
its
great
for
what
it
is
this
was
better
for
being
put
away
for
3
months
compared
to
the
first
one
i
tried
reviewed
4807
i
had
high
hopes
for
this
one
but
it
just
fell
short
for
me
remarks
did
not
score
a
t
s
m
at
that
time
so
please
disregard
those
scores
very
nice
refreshing
deceptively
complex
and
smooth
this
one
screams
summertime
to
me
but
id
have
to
watch
that
abv
since
its
totally
unnoticable
dont
find
a
whole
lot
of
this
style
im
glad
i
got
to
try
it
overall
an
interesting
beer
just
not
my
style
o
incredibly
wellcrafted
and
clean
with
great
attention
to
detail
enough
flavor
to
be
interesting
without
being
extreme
in
any
area
maybe
its
too
airbrushed
and
perfect
because
somehow
it
doesnt
blow
me
away
a
very
very
solid
brew
it
is
exactly
whathow
it
should
be
succeeds
where
others
consistently
fail
while
this
isnt
a
very
typical
style
to
be
found
around
north
america
this
import
is
an
absolute
delight
and
an
excellent
ambassador
of
the
style
on
its
merits
alone
this
is
an
amazingly
clean
tasting
ale
that
exhibits
the
talent
and
craftsmanship
of
the
people
who
produced
itnone
of
this
happens
by
chance
definitely
worth
seeking
out
especially
if
this
is
the
only
bière
de
garde
that
you
ever
try
or
simply
the
first

overall
a
great

of
belgian
golden
strong
highlight
for
me
was
the
appearance
really
outstanding
clarity
and
head
retention
o
very
nice
dont
know
how
much
i
could
have
after
because
of
the
abv
but
what
can
you
do
overall
a
great
classic
example
of
what
a
farmhouse
ale
should
be
brisk
elegant
complex
and
rustic
an
outstanding
and
wellbalanced
beer
like
a
cross
between
a
tripel
and
a
super
saison
taste
a
very
good
brew
im
not
thoroughly
experienced
with
bières
de
garde
but
i
find
this
to
be
enjoyable
on
the
level
of
a
nice
tripel
i
will
definitely
have
to
have
this
again
o
very
drinkable
reminiscent
of
champagne
and
a
similar
mouthfeel
to
la
fin
du
monde
overall
just
a
great
beer
to
enjoy
a
drink
that
deserves
a
lot
of
attention
deserves
its
place
like
a
solid
white
wine
next
to
it
a
decent
beer
but
rather
simple
and
safe
o
overall
not
my
cup
of
tea
its
a
decent
beer
to
style
but
i
dont
think
the
style
is
for
me
nicely
crafted
750

great

and
extremely
smooth
to
sip
on
highly
enjoyable
offering
overall
i
had
this
not
knowing
a
thing
about
it
this
beer
feels
like
the
best
imperial
pilsener
i
have
ever
had
i
was
astonished
on
the
greatness
of
this
beer
i
will
but
it
again
and
again
yes
that
good
salud
food
match
with
a
brew
of
such
vinous
characters
i
would
recommend
a
food
match
similar
to
a
likeminded
wine
pinot
gris
bouillabaisse
peruvian
ceviche
paella
or
spaghetti
aglio
olio
e
peperoncino
smell
is
not
to
much
to
talk
about
a
light
maltlagerlike
aroma
not
really
as
i
remember
it
taste
is
a
thinnish
mouthfeel
and
slightly
tart
then
some
hoppiness
finishes
quickly
i
remember
this
being
much
better
years
back
the
bottle
is
fresh
and
in
good
condition
dunno
maybe
its
the
trained
palate
ive
attained
in
the
years
since
last
sampling
pours
a
crystal
clear
light
yellow
with
a
2
inch
puffy
white
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
foamy
rings
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
grain
light
fruits
and
some
skunky
aromas
that
fade
as
the
beer
warms
taste
is
of
grain
grasshay
slight
fruit
and
some
herbal
hop
flavors
there
is
also
a
stinging
alcohol
flavor
in
the
mouth
with
each
sip
a
mild
bitterness
lingers
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
the
skunky
aromas
that
fade
out
are
somewhat
weird
o
very
drinkable
fruity
and
earthy
and
refreshing
thank
a
lot
dan
it
tastes
light
too
almost
like
drinking
a
riesling
but
thats
a
good
thing
provided
that
you
have
the
right
food
for
it
it
goes
well
with
anything
youd
use
white
wine
for
cheese
fruit
delicately
seasoned
seafood
the
alcohol
content
is
well
hidden
which
makes
it
a
very
good
session
beer
for
long
summer
evenings
start
with
grilled
scallops
and
vegetables
continue
on
with
hard
cheese
and
prosciutto
then
finish
with
fresh
fruit
and
brie
this
beer
can
go
along
with
all
of
these
d
this
beer
is
quite
subtle
in
terms
of
flavor
so
its
pretty
easy
to
drink
despite
the
booziness
i
would
have
it
again
but
i
think
id
like
to
get
more
experience
with
the
style
before
doing
so
this
is
a
wonderful
biere
de
garde
has
a
bit
of
sourness
attached
to
it
but
it
would
not
be
confused
with
a
flemish
red
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
for
those
that
like
farmhouse
styles
a
half
finger
of
bright
white
foam
sits
atop
a
crystal
clear
bright
golden
body
smells
of
apples
and
pears
with
a
touch
of
cinnamon
and
clove
also
shows
some
traces
of
bready
yeast
and
hops
the
taste
is
outstanding
tart
crisp
fruits
lead
the
way
to
a
well
balanced
bready
malt
body
with
traces
of
yeast
and
hops
mouthfeel
is
very
sharp
at
first
with
a
creamy
feel
to
the
body
and
a
short
crisp
finish
as
the
beer
warms
the
alochol
comes
out
from
hiding
but
never
dominates
this
is
an
excellant
beer
and
at
8
a
bottle
i
will
be
buying
more
of
these
too
boozy
and
too
grainymetallic
packs
a
lot
more
flavour
than
the
the
look
or
smell
of
it
gives
away
tasty
o
nice
beer
nice
balance
champagne
of
beers
overall
this
grew
on
me
its
highly
quaffable
but
take
your
time
and
sip
this
one
a
bit
enjoy
the
changes
as
it
warms
up
and
the
flavor
profile
opens
almost
too
drinkable
but
the
8
5
abv
does
start
making
itself
feel
known
after
sneaking
up
at
first
pours
an
amazing
clear
gold
color
w
a
big
three
finger
head
the
head
is
quickly
down
to
one
finger
after
a
couple
minutes
excellent
carbonation
and
fantastic
lacing
on
my
snifter
glass
the
nose
is
spices
some
yeast
malt
and
slight
funkiness
very
smooth
refreshing
and
clean
smelling
taste
is
similar
to
the
nose
nothing
different
here
this
beer
is
super
smooth
spicy
and
refreshing
i
dont
get
any
of
the
8
5
abv
in
the
taste
at
all
this
would
be
an
incredible
summer
beer
if
you
dont
mind
the
higher
alcohol
and
dont
want
a
session
brew
overall
this
is
good
but
maybe
a
hair
short
of
great
still
i
would
get
this
again
cheers
this
is
still
a
fairly
unfamiliar
style
to
me
but
i
get
what
theyre
doing
and
this
one
does
it
very
well
3
monts
pours
a
crystal
clear
goldenrod
with
a
buckshot
of
lemon
shining
through
upon
being
held
up
to
light
the
fluffy
white
foam
that
sprung
up
after
each
pour
always
had
good
height
and
head
retention
lacing
started
out
solid
and
only
got
nicer
with
each
subsequent
pour
the
nose
is
a
little
timid
but
does
feature
a
very
nice
delicate
balance
between
pale
and
stone
fruits
and
peppery
aromas
the
flavor
is
a
bit
more
robust
but
still
centers
around
that
fruitpepper
dichotomy
theres
a
bit
of
honey
that
joins
in
with
the
apples
and
pears
up
front
and
a
subtle
warming
from
the
alcohol
that
comes
in
along
with
the
spicy
phenols
the
mouthfeel
is
absolutely
phenomenal
the
body
is
surprisingly
light
given
the
solid
malt
presence
and
the
carbonation
is
expansive
and
active
belgian
at
its
finest
3
monts
is
a
great
beer
and
a
very
good
biere
de
garde
one
id
be
more
than
happy
to
have
again
o
3
monts
was
really
enjoyable
it
has
a
simple
yet
complex
taste
it
wasnt
too
expensive
either
so
i
would
happily
purchase
this
beer
again
o
this
beer
could
go
with
anything
i
enjoyed
it
by
itself
on
a
relaxing
night
in
sc
great
way
to
get
back
into
the
swing
of
things
very
nice
beer
o
enjoyable
i
would
drink
it
again
on
a
hot
summer
day
an
overall
easy
to
like
easy
to
drink
beer
o
defiantly
a
table
beer
this
beer
is
nice
but
maybe
subtle
to
a
fault
until
you
let
it
play
with
food
i
threw
it
at
a
lentilmushroomkale
pasta
dish
and
it
really
shined
cleaning
the
lentil
off
my
tongue
while
highlighting
the
mushroom
and
spices
of
the
dish
the
sweetness
of
the
belgian
candy
sugar
seemed
to
help
balance
out
the
dryness
of
the
dish
as
a
whole
great
balance
of
flavors
and
a
quality
biere
de
garde
poured
a
3
white
head
slow
to
recede
clear
light
gold
dark
straw
yellow
body
smells
mildly
like
a
lager
but
with
an
herbal
element
to
it
taste
when
colder
is
mildly
malty
and
after
a
little
warmer
a
citrusy
aspect
comes
out
its
also
creamy
and
has
a
medium
long
finish
nice
ale
of
course
this
is
a
nice
product
to
drink
but
far
from
great
beer
and
far
from
deserving
all
the
praise
it
receives
on
french
territory
good
but
not
great
o
really
dry
if
compared
to
my
previous
biere
de
garde
tastings
kinda
reminds
of
a
lager
with
very
nice
drinkability
overall
a
very
nice
beer
in
its
simplicity
o
a
good
beer
but
not
enough
body
to
be
a
winner
but
if
you
compare
it
to
other
blond
beers
overall
if
they
put
this
in
12oz
4packs
or
6packs
id
always
keep
it
stocked
o
on
a
hot
day
you
could
drink
this
all
day
long
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
a
great
beer
o
some
complexity
without
too
much
and
a
very
interesting
beer
one
worth
having
again
o
quality
easy
drinking
interesting
tipple
will
definately
try
again
i
was
a
bit
apprehensive
about
this
one
after
not
enjoying
the
reserve
at
all
but
this
was
really
quite
good
the
look
of
this
beer
after
i
poured
it
was
fantastice
bright
golden
color
perfect
clarity
not
even
a
trace
of
sediment
in
the
bottle
i
got
the
head
was
massive
a
fine
white
foam
with
great
consistency
head
lingers
throughout
the
entire
beer
leaving
clumps
of
lace
all
around
the
glass
there
is
a
fine
layer
of
bubbles
that
never
breaks
across
the
surface
of
the
brew
aromas
a
of
light
fruits
a
bit
of
must
and
hay
in
there
but
very
clean
flavor
has
a
nice
intensity
medium
body
with
a
very
powerful
finish
a
belgian
tripellike
fruitiness
is
complimented
by
the
alcohol
burn
on
the
finish
very
cool
beer
and
i
nice
break
from
all
the
soursstoutsipas
ive
been
drinking
dr
price
is
pretty
high
for
the
limited
quality
but
its
pretty
drinkable
i
wish
it
were
more
complex
overall
3
monts
is
a
really
really
good
beer
when
i
was
first
getting
into
the
world
of
craft
beer
i
remember
having
another
offering
from
saintsylvestre
gavroche
that
really
opened
my
eyes
this
beer
is
as
good
as
i
remember
gavroche
to
be
and
im
really
glad
i
tried
it
ive
always
thought
that
the
bier
de
garde
was
a
very
underrated
style
and
this
brew
only
helped
to
reinforce
that
notion
as
this
is
a
very
nice
drinking
beer
the
beer
is
golden
yellow
hued
with
a
small
white
head
that
leaves
a
fair
amount
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
offers
some
funk
yeast
fruit
apples
in
particular
and
alcohol
the
flavor
is
ok
with
a
really
heavy
apple
presence
sweetness
grows
as
i
make
my
way
through
the
glass
overall
this
was
an
oddity
but
i
did
enjoy
it
id
be
interested
to
try
it
again
i
had
no
idea
what
to
expect
and
i
was
pretty
stoked
with
what
i
got
it
reminds
me
of
a
jacked
up
pil
i
was
expecting
a
funky
saison
but
what
i
got
was
still
most
satisfying
some
surprises
work
out
well
in
the
end
overall
a
pretty
good
beverage
after
a
few
glasses
you
certainly
start
feeling
the
alcohol
certainly
one
of
the
better
beire
de
gardes
i
have
tried
this
beer
would
be
great
on
a
hot
summer
day
as
it
was
very
refreshing
and
highly
drinkable
o
definitly
drink
this
one
over
and
over
again
and
again
wow
disappointed
in
this
beer
i
expected
a
bspa
or
biere
de
garde
flavors
but
all
i
got
was
american
adjunct
lager
the
beer
is
well
made
no
signs
of
infection
or
anything
else
the
flavor
is
just
not
close
to
what
it
should
be
curious
to
see
what
this
tastes
like
as
it
warms
i
dont
think
this
is
a
biere
de
garde
as
the
malt
doesnt
suggest
it
this
reminds
me
of
a
strong
euro
lager
the
yeast
is
boring
what
happened
here
this
beer
is
very
dry
despite
being
one
of
the
creamiest
beers
ive
tasted
it
has
a
great
finish
and
is
very
drinkable
overall
a
fantastic
beer
that
hasnt
received
the
attention
it
deserves
d
this
beer
is
very
light
and
subtle
but
the
fizz
starts
to
make
it
a
bit
to
bland
as
it
washes
out
the
flavor
and
it
also
boost
the
bitterness
which
dominates
the
finish
jd
well
done
d
drinks
quite
nicely
especially
for
its
abv
this
one
could
sneak
up
on
you
for
sure
drinkability
talk
about
a
good
drinker
its
hard
to
sip
this
beer
which
is
too
bad
because
it
deserves
a
careful
pace
it
defines
crisp
and
clean
well
done
overall
what
we
found
most
enjoyable
about
this
brew
was
the
inclusive
smell
it
had
a
nice
sweetness
with
inclusions
of
candy
esters
and
clean
malts
all
around
in
the
flavor
however
it
was
hard
to
pick
up
on
any
of
the
nice
flavors
alluded
to
in
the
nose
and
a
fairly
standard
beer
is
presented
nice
saison
this
is
what
northern
french
beers
are
all
about
m
ligher
bodied
high
carbonation
d
very
very
high
especially
given
the
abv
and
i
even
suspect
this
beer
has
a
considerably
low
calorie
to
alcohol
ratio
to
boot
like
duvel
easy
drinking
not
as
complex
as
some
others
but
not
a
negative
to
drinkability
very
worthy
of
a
try
and
repeat
performance
d
almost
too
drinkable
because
of
the
light
flavors
but
also
complex
compared
to
its
generic
golden
lager
bretheren
a
very
good
beer
and
a
nice
discovery
on
my
part
will
be
searching
out
this
style
again
ive
only
had
about
3
interpretations
of
this
style
and
this
is
by
far
my
favourite
its
a
tricky
one
that
made
me
really
think
and
analyze
everything
going
on
from
the
nose
to
its
drinkability
and
its
750ml
size
easily
allowed
me
to
do
that
it
is
subtle
but
thats
half
the
fun
about
picking
everything
out
well
balanced
and
dangerously
quaffable
its
almost
scary
to
say
that
this
is
an
easy
session
beer
even
at
8
5
abv
im
really
glad
i
was
able
to
get
my
hands
on
this
one
thanks
to
the
fantastic
selection
at
premier
wines
and
spirits
in
halifax
it
really
did
make
me
appreciate
this
style
that
much
more
thumbs
way
up
overall
another
impressive
beer
from
saint
sylvestre
although
i
enjoyed
their
grande
reserve
better
from
a
bottle
at
des
moines
brewfest
a
beer
id
wanted
to
try
for
some
time
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
good
head
the
aroma
is
pear
and
some
fresh
bread
baguette
specifically
the
beer
is
dry
and
has
some
apricot
some
baguette
a
mild
toasty
note
and
a
good
bit
of
bitterness
really
very
good
a
classic
overall
interesting
flavors
a
bit
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
but
still
enjoyed
it
a
decent
beer
ill
forgive
a
touch
of
possible
lightstrike
and
say
that
this
is
decent
unfortunately
it
lacks
the
real
fruity
maltiness
of
a
biere
de
garde
taste
is
a
typical
bottom
fermented
beer
the
beer
is
dominated
by
the
malt
expecially
pilsmalt
rounded
of
by
a
light
dextrinous
doughy
maltiness
also
some
bready
notes
the
mouthfeel
is
dry
and
has
a
light
bitterness
not
the
typical
biere
de
garde
but
what
is
drinkability
great
easy
drinking
beer
very
refreshing
i
will
most
certainly
have
this
beer
again
d
pretty
good
beer
but
i
enjoyed
the
other
one
ive
tried
for
them
the
flavouring
could
be
better
but
as
it
is
its
not
a
bad
beer
d
drinks
like
a
4
abv
pilsner
not
a
8
5
abv
strong
ale
not
something
i
would
seek
out
again
but
still
drinkable
d
the
grain
and
sourness
was
a
nice
surprise
in
what
was
an
otherwise
boring
beer
i
would
probably
drink
this
over
something
like
a
pale
ale
but
otherwise
not
something
i
would
revisit
milder
cousin
to
the
special
alegrand
reserve
of
the
same
name
this
is
a
bit
weak
in
comparison
but
this
is
a
more
refreshing
beer
and
could
be
an
excellent
introduction
to
these
beers
with
the
yeast
funk
i
guess
i
need
to
try
this
again
i
dont
see
what
all
the
fuss
is
about
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
i
just
expected
something
a
little
different
the
palate
opens
with
a
beautiful
delicate
herbal
character
with
a
lemon
and
grassy
haylike
hops
most
prominent
delicate
and
nuanced
theres
a
light
pepperlike
zing
malt
character
is
light
but
complex
with
a
blend
of
crackers
a
little
honey
both
of
which
work
very
well
with
the
opening
flavors
a
little
dried
ginger
especially
on
the
finish
this
beer
is
crisp
with
a
light
fruit
character
red
apples
and
maybe
some
pears
the
flavors
on
this
beer
are
so
delicate
that
the
power
of
suggestion
definitely
has
its
way
the
finish
is
gorgeous
long
drying
with
a
blend
of
spice
and
a
light
hop
bitterness
this
is
beautifully
balanced
a
little
alcohol
appears
too
carbonation
is
high
making
this
lightbodied
beer
immensely
refreshing
and
quenching
fantastic
stuff
im
glad
i
can
pick
up
more
of
this
at
my
local
whole
foods
an
interesting
and
pretty
tasty
beer
with
a
nice
rounded
belgian
quality
what
with
the
pale
malts
yeast
spice
and
very
well
obfuscated
elevated
abv
running
the
show
given
the
style
description
this
hits
it
bangon
in
all
the
right
ways
and
remains
eminently
drinkable
taste
fairly
crisp
and
sweet
up
front
with
lemon
pear
and
spice
with
intense
almost
notes
which
is
quite
interesting
and
totally
unexpected
form
the
smell
grains
are
light
and
strawlike
throughout
in
the
middle
the
beer
gets
a
little
drier
and
the
almond
flavor
becomes
more
nutty
some
smooth
caramel
and
pepper
spice
the
finish
is
quite
dry
with
noticeable
alcohol
and
some
residual
almond
pear
and
spice
mostly
pepper
overall
average
golden
style
strong
ale
that
is
quite
overpriced
for
the
quality
if
you
ask
me
seemed
like
a
wannabe
duvel
not
terrible
though
d
interesting
beer
with
some
appealing
flavours
smell
and
taste
work
together
to
form
a
lovely
unison
relatively
smooth
so
could
be
drunk
all
day
if
you
can
be
bothered
getting
the
metal
clasp
off
the
cork
overall
very
drinkable
delicious
highly
recommend
this
one
goes
nicely
with
food
d
i
wanted
to
like
this
but
in
the
end
i
was
not
impressed
slightly
sweet
boozy
and
slightly
astringent
very
good
for
the
style
the
kind
of
beer
that
makes
me
bolt
outside
and
enjoy
the
meadow
and
hug
sheep
d
a
really
good
and
tasty
biere
de
garde
ive
been
wanting
to
try
this
for
the
longest
time
im
glad
some
bottles
finally
showed
up
in
the
southland
overall
i
am
surprised
by
the
quality
of
this
beer
even
if
this
one
expired
almost
a
year
ago
i
saw
another
one
on
the
shelves
without
any
expiration
date
so
i
think
this
mention
is
not
really
useful
great
beer
with
tons
of
character
out
of
a
generously
provided
bottle
from
a
friend
this
beer
was
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
towering
head
of
foam
that
both
retained
well
and
laced
nicely
as
it
slowly
gave
way
an
impressive
looking
brew
the
aroma
was
exotic
and
enjoyable
sour
apples
belgianstyle
yeast
funk
candy
sugar
fruit
and
floral
notes
and
a
healthy
dose
of
spices
multifaceted
and
impressive
the
flavors
were
similar
to
a
belgian
beer
without
so
much
emphasis
on
the
yeast
tart
apples
lemon
zest
sugarysweetness
pepper
herbal
and
grassy
notes
and
a
light
mustiness
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
the
body
medium
and
the
carbonation
lively
though
this
higher
carbonation
reduced
how
quaffable
the
beer
was
it
was
still
very
refreshing
and
summery
notes
makes
me
think
of
a
rustic
france
fruit
orchardfarm
interesting
mix
of
flavors
had
a
750
ml
so
i
reduced
some
down
to
make
a
sauce
that
was
a
really
nice
light
fruity
and
spiced
tasting
sauce
super
drinkable
beer
just
one
problem
it
comes
at
the
cost
of
flavor
and
complexity
too
bad
this
isnt
as
complex
as
say
hennepin
it
appeared
to
be
like
a
round
bodied
lager
based
beer
which
isnt
what
it
should
having
said
that
i
quite
enjoyed
the
beer
first
time
with
the
style
not
what
i
expected
very
summery
and
drinkable
but
wouldnt
mind
more
malt
and
less
burn
a
bit
too
much
like
wine
for
beer
notes
a
pleasant
surprise
taste
has
some
musty
type
funk
in
the
forefront
bit
of
spice
profile
from
the
yeast
finishes
dry
and
slightly
tart
light
on
the
palate
mouthfeel
is
light
and
spritzy
this
is
an
easy
to
drink
beer
despite
the
high
abv
overall
this
is
a
quite
drinkable
beer
for
8
5
abv
its
well
balanced
and
complex
none
of
the
flavors
dominate
and
they
all
blend
nicely
together
trois
monts
is
a
beer
to
be
taken
cautiously
it
is
quite
drinkable
but
the
overall
high
gravity
contributes
to
a
body
that
is
fortunately
self
limiting
certainly
worth
a
try
d
good
but
not
quite
what
i
was
expecting
the
sweet
and
tart
combination
worked
much
better
in
the
nose
than
in
the
taste
a
stronger
tart
with
a
back
up
sweetness
would
have
been
more
enjoyable
in
my
opinion
this
would
pair
well
with
chicken
shwarma
d
very
good
for
sipping
to
admire
the
complexities
this
was
my
first
biere
de
garde
and
a
fairly
pleasurable
initial
experience
the
flavours
arent
exactly
down
my
alley
but
it
seemed
well
done
thanks
to
shawn
for
the
bottle
which
has
been
stored
in
dereks
fridge
for
a
month
or
two
d
its
got
character
but
its
a
little
boozy
d
overall
this
one
goes
down
pretty
easy
although
not
terribly
complex
it
basks
in
sunny
summer
simplicity
a
very
commendable
showing
for
a
flanders
golden
a
beer
to
be
had
at
least
once
just
is
missing
something
that
keeps
me
from
going
i
want
more
have
always
read
good
things
about
it
but
will
have
to
give
this
another
chance
eventually
dwould
have
no
problem
with
a
bottle
to
myself
but
12oz
was
plenty
for
me
not
very
high
in
alcohol
and
a
good
enough
taste
to
make
another
purchase
i
can
see
how
this
beer
could
be
perfect
in
the
right
environment
its
a
relatively
high
abv
but
its
so
easy
drinking
id
think
itd
make
a
great
replacement
to
a
summer
wine
very
tart
and
fruity
but
balanced
by
malt
so
its
not
overpowering
light
and
carbonated
not
really
what
i
look
for
in
a
beer
but
it
works
bit
overpriced
here
because
of
its
boutique
factor
so
probably
wont
really
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
often
but
it
was
an
enjoyable
experience
this
french
beer
is
close
enough
to
belgium
in
taste
and
geographical
location
yet
it
has
its
very
own
unique
properties
great
beer
and
one
im
always
amazed
to
see
omitted
from
top
10
20
or
whatever
beer
lists
id
not
drink
this
regularly
but
as
an
experience
it
was
quite
something
im
more
likely
to
buy
again
to
share
a
tasting
session
with
another
person
we
had
this
with
a
meal
and
it
was
a
poor
choice
for
accompanying
food
tarragon
butter
stuffed
roast
chicken
much
better
in
isolation
id
say
subtle
and
sublime
a
superb
beer
from
start
to
finish
i
would
not
buy
this
regularly
but
it
makes
for
an
excellent
change
of
pace
quite
rustic
and
charming
give
this
a
try
taste
and
mouthfeel
yummy
i
like
so
much
this
style
of
beers
the
alcoholic
aftertaste
is
strong
though
attention
not
to
lose
the
number
of
glasses
you
have
especially
if
you
open
such
a
big
bottle
alone
d
so
refreshing
and
enjoyable
this
would
be
a
summer
drink
that
i
would
absolutely
crave
ill
take
this
instead
of
champaign
or
most
white
wines
any
day
incredibly
balanced
and
unique
closest
resemblance
would
be
orval
or
maybe
saison
dupont
just
more
of
that
lemon
grass
funk
pours
a
hazy
golden
orange
color
with
a
big
foamy
white
head
light
fruit
aroma
with
hints
of
apple
pear
white
grape
spice
and
alcohol
carbonated
and
slightly
spicy
with
light
fruit
notes
and
a
strong
alcohol
presence
apple

grape
pepper
alcohol
warmth
with
a
slightly
dry
finish
i
would
love
to
try
this
one
before
it
had
to
spend
two
months
on
a
boat
thick
syrupy
malt
flavour
on
the
tongue
progresses
to
a
long
hoppy
palate
with
a
lot
of
flavour
its
rich
and
strong
with
hints
of
coriander
soil
and
citrus
characters
slightly
stinging
mouthfeel
and
intense
flavour
makes
it
respectable
but
its
not
all
that
complex
just
strong
and
long
like
my
penis
d
a
nice
beer
easily
drinkable
given
the
relatively
high
abv
drinkable
for
the
abv
right
on
style
this
beer
had
a
good
yeasty
and
bread
like
aroma
it
was
very
complex
with
lots
of
earthy
grain
and
grass
tones
it
was
very
crisp
the
taste
is
about
the
same
but
a
little
bitterer
there
is
a
great
use
of
hops
it
is
a
very
refreshing
beer
with
an
almost
medium
body
and
moderate
bite
brilliant
body
clean
yellow
body
with
the
right
amount
of
head
and
lace
i
will
try
more
in
this
style
the
aroma
is
grainy
and
yeasty
with
some
hops
the
appearance
is
yellow
gold
with
a
foamy
head
the
flavor
is
decent
and
like
the
aroma
with
somewhat
of
a
sharp
taste
the
palate
is
smooth
but
not
that
thick
the
beer
is
pretty
good
overall
but
lacks
anything
special
that
stands
out
after
having
the
oro
de
calabaza
my
interest
was
sparked
with
this
style
so
i
wanted
to
go
with
an
authentic
example
pours
an
interesting
clear
straw
color
with
2
fingers
worth
of
fizzy
white
heading
lots
of
carbonation
appears
to
be
in
this
beer
as
evidenced
by
the
many
bubbles
rising
to
the
top
of
the
glass
from
smell
i
get
lots
of
grain
and
hay
a
bit
of
funky
barnyard
yeah
that
is
about
it
as
far
as
smell
is
concerned
very
complex
flavor
minerally
spicy
yet
sweet
more
essences
of
funk
and
bright
grain
tastes
mouthfeel
is
light
and
as
expected
very
carbonated
almost
like
sipping
on
funky
champaign
leaves
an
interesting
numb
feeling
on
the
teeth
as
well
which
i
suspect
is
the
strength
of
the
beer
talking
drinking
a
glass
or
two
of
this
is
no
problem
in
my
book
i
can
see
how
some
might
consider
this
to
be
a
cousin
to
saison
in
that
they
share
some
of
the
same
complexities
and
farmhouse
connotations
3
monts
is
a
winner
for
me
paired
nicely
with
some
sea
salted
pita
chips
and
hummus
cheers
notes
and
tasted
on
53104
pours
a
brilliant
and
bright
gold
with
a
two
finger
cap
of
fluffy
white
foam
that
resembles
snow
covered
hills
as
it
slides
slowly
to
a
paper
thin
covering
the
nose
is
slightly
sweet
and
grainy
with
floral
grassy
noteslike
i
just
opened
the
window
on
a
early
spring
morningwow
this
is
nice
i
must
admit
that
i
was
a
little
apprehensive
when
i
purchased
thisbecause
my
last
experience
with
a
flanders
red
was
not
so
enjoyable
i
will
never
let
my
naivety
rule
my
beer
purchasing
againi
made
a
wise
decision
picking
up
the
3
monts
i
will
try
a
flanders
red
againbut
for
now
i
think
biere
de
garde
is
the
top
dogg
upfront
its
a
bit
spicy
and
complex
with
light
fruitspear
and
white
grape
and
graininess
that
is
earthy
and
seemingly
aged
to
perfection
subtle
alcohol
warms
the
belly
and
drys
the
pallet
the
carbonation
is
something
i
have
never
experiencedits
very
soothing
and
softa
nice
contrast
to
the
peppery
flavors
that
bite
the
tongue
this
is
one
classy
azz
beeri
feel
like
im
drinking
something
fit
for
a
king
this
felt
lighter
than
an
8
5abv
it
did
appeal
tremendously
as
a
world
class
session
drink
if
one
can
afford
stay
upright
pours
a
pale
golden
yellow
color
no
sediment
slight
haze
and
a
big
frothy
pure
white
head
with
some
rising
carbonation
classic
artisinal
farmhouse
nose
slightly
grassy
and
haylike
with
a
limey
bitterness
quality
about
it
smoothed
out
by
a
layer
of
biscuits
and
spicy
yeast
pale
malts
really
do
an
excellent
job
of
balancing
the
dry
grassy
hop
character
medium
bodied
with
very
bright
carbonation
quality
beer
this
beer
changes
a
lot
after
it
warms
up
a
little
bit
apparently
my
fridge
was
far
to
cold
for
this
beer
d
notes
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
very
sessionable
i
liked
the
subtle
funk
as
a
balancing
point
d
yup
this
is
ideal
warm
weather
ale
to
swirl
down
probably
food
friendly
too
id
drink
this
again
slightly
sweet
mildly
alcoholic
scent
with
traces
of
bread
spice
and
hops
tangy
spicy
flavour
with
a
good
malt
profile
a
little
bit
low
on
the
hops
alright
carbonation
not
to
overpowering
nice
to
drink
but
fairly
strong
the
alcohol
is
reasonably
noticeable
and
this
hampers
the
drinkability
quite
a
bit
oh
by
the
way
this
is
a
great
value
at
5
00
for
a
750ml
bottle
cant
beat
the
price
vs
quality
would
gladly
pay
8
to
9
for
a
750ml
drinkability
a
lot
of
interesting
elements
in
this
beer
although
i
wish
it
were
a
bit
dryer
on
the
finish
it
is
otherwise
quite
engaging
the
beer
pours
a
clear
gold
hue
with
several
small
streams
of
carbonation
rising
to
the
surface
very
fizzy
sounding
bleached
white
head
foams
up
4
cm
easily
aroma
is
green
apple
must
white
grapes
some
booze
and
hints
of
spiciness
first
sip
reveals
ave
to
lite
body
with
very
fine
fizzy
carbonation
flavor
is
sweet
white
wine
and
grapes
with
fruity
apple
and
melon
but
finishes
very
dry
and
bitey
with
some
booze
showing
up
there
is
a
little
warming
as
well
a
decent
beer
but
not
a
favorite
of
mine
i
probably
wont
seek
this
one
out
again
this
is
about
as
smooth
as
a
lager
can
be
even
with
the
high
abv
this
can
be
enjoyed
on
a
nice
warm
summer
day
a
750
ml
bottle
of
3
monts
flanders
golden
ale
a
darker
golden
color
with
a
big
white
head
that
left
little
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
herbal
and
earthy
bready
slightly
musky
and
also
clove
smooth
and
round
with
a
medium
body
malt
up
front
followed
by
an
influence
of
hops
dry
with
a
mineral
twang
spicy
earthy
and
sweet
malt
characteristics
all
meld
together
to
produce
a
complex
flavor
profile
the
finish
is
pepper
hops
and
alcohol
leaving
a
pleasant
warmness
definitely
worth
seeking
if
you
havent
had
the
pleasure
overall
a
truly
excellent
craft
farmhouse
ale
ive
about
decided
to
stop
trying
american
craft
farmhouse
ales
because
they
simply
cant
compete
with
the
real
thing
exception
hennepin
and
anything
out
of
quebec
this
would
be
amazing
with
french
cooking
rabbit
quail
coq
au
vin
anything
youd
serve
with
champagne
i
cant
wait
to
buy
a
case
and
stick
it
in
my
cellar
this
beer
gets
my
enthusiastic
approval
i
will
seek
it
out
it
brought
to
mind
a
variety
of
possible
food
pairings
ill
have
to
get
a
few
bottles
more
of
this
to
try
with
different
combinations
at
a
food
and
beer
experiment
with
my
friends
by
chance
i
had
the
second
half
with
kielbasa
and
pierogies
for
dinner
and
it
went
very
well
together
though
i
could
think
of
other
good
possibilities
as
well
pours
a
clear
gold
with
a
frothy
white
head
flavor
has
a
sweet
tang
to
it
this
immediately
reminds
me
of
the
obolon
krepkoe
grain
attributes
and
a
sweet
tone
and
high
alcohol
as
well
its
smooth
for
the
most
part
with
just
a
wee
bit
of
bite
on
it
feel
is
nice
very
drinkable
yes
but
this
reminds
me
of
so
many
other
beers
i
have
had
it
doesnt
really
stand
out
and
who
is
the
moron
who
did
the
whole
cork
thing
with
the
metal
bar
really
dumb
well
i
think
this
is
my
first
french
beer
while
they
did
cave
in
to
the
nazis
i
suppose
i
can
forget
about
that
for
just
a
bit
while
i
review
this
beer
btw
i
thought
i
told
the
bros
to
update
so
we
can
see
what
countries
weve
had
beers
from
anyway
has
a
beautiful
color
to
it
a
very
busy
beer
lots
of
carbonation
a
big
white
head
is
also
prominent
smell
alot
like
your
belgian
sparkling
ales
and
such
taste
is
very
very
good
its
a
smooth
drinking
beer
that
dances
in
the
mouth
from
the
carbonation
the
champagne
of
the
beer
world
not
in
the
sense
that
it
is
the
best
i
have
certainly
had
better
beers
but
i
could
definitely
see
this
as
a
good
substitute
for
champers
may
not
appeal
to
lovers
of
dark
rich
beers
but
is
undoubtedly
classy
clean
and
very
good
i
found
this
750ml
bottle
for
15
but
it
can
be
seen
for
over
22
in
some
bottle
shops
so
be
sure
you
dont
get
ripped
off
beer
was
unavailable
for
a
while
had
a
distirbution
problem
seems
to
be
somewhat
flat
and
lacking
some
flavor
i
remember
there
being
some
floaties
or
it
being
unfermented
does
anybody
know
if
they
changed
the
recipe
if
so
i
was
unimpressed
not
bad
recommended
i
realize
this
beer
has
been
around
for
some
time
but
i
am
more
and
more
impressed
with
french
beers
lately
a
true
pleasure
and
well
priced
at
7
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
sweet
funky
earthy
with
a
mineral
and
spice
finish
overall
i
felt
a
bit
disappointed
by
this
my
first
biere
de
garde
quite
interesting
but
nothing
too
special
not
too
shabby
would
drink
again
cest
une
bière
moelleuse
qui
accompagnerait
à
merveille
un
repas
moderate
body
with
lively
active
carbonation
which
tingles
down
your
throat
with
each
mouthful
it
is
so
incredibly
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
and
is
easy
to
drink
i
could
get
through
a
couple
of
bottles
of
this
with
ease
weird
one
this
i
dont
know
if
its
a
stylistic
difference
that
i
find
so
challenging
but
theres
bits
to
this
that
make
it
rather
difficult
to
drink
whether
its
the
intensity
of
the
yeast
character
the
heat
of
the
alcohol
which
isnt
quite
covered
up
or
something
else
something
rankles
with
me
here
when
ive
tried
more
bières
de
garde
ill
probably
know
more
but
for
now
ill
say
good
but
not
great
drinkability
this
is
one
interesting
beer
and
i
hope
our
paths
will
cross
again
this
is
meant
to
be
cellared
and
likely
has
been
at
the
store
i
bought
it
from
as
i
have
not
seen
another
since
but
i
would
like
to
keep
another
to
cellar
back
as
well
a
really
smooth
pleasurable

drinkability
very
easy
to
drink
light
and
refreshing
d
very
drinkable
beer
the
funkiness
keeps
it
interesting
and
the
hops
and
yeasty
spicy
character
make
for
a
refreshing
beer
that
is
hard
to
put
down
taste
has
the
same
lightness
as
the
aroma
with
vanilla
and
wheat
combining
with
just
a
touch
of
hops
mouthfeel
is
light
crisp
and
bubbly
with
a
fantastic
smoothness
to
it
this
is
a
deceptively
strong
beer
as
there
isnt
a
hint
of
alcohol
anywhere
to
be
noticed
definately
easy
to
drink
mouthfeel
was
zesty
with
a
medium
to
light
body
overrated
but
im
glad
i
experienced
it
regardless
d
nice
enough
but
ive
had
better
beers
in
this
style
while
i
know
biere
de
garde
is
a
mile
wide
stylewise
i
found
this
to
be
a
very
unusual
bier
de
garde
compared
to
othes
ive
had
in
appearance
aroma
and
flavor
it
was
light
and
lemony
which
really
struck
me
as
characteristics
that
would
be
more
suited
to
say
a
witbier
than
to
this
style
it
was
a
very
light
yellow
and
highly
effervescent
aroma
was
very
faint
and
smelled
like
lemon
zest
with
a
bit
of
maltiness
flavor
was
a
bit
sour
that
lemon
zest
again
with
a
lot
of
maltiness
for
such
a
light
smelling
and
tasting
beer
i
would
recommend
this
beer
as
i
found
it
very
interesting
however
i
didnt
find
drinking
it
to
be
particulary
pleasant
this
is
a
curiousity
not
a
great
beer
a
second
pour
gave
me
residual
yeast
but
no
extra
flavour
a
lively
mouthfeel
but
the
same
citrus
and
grass
in
wine
youd
say
it
was
herbaceous
you
say
this
when
you
cant
pinpoint
the
flavour
this
is
too
delicate
a
beer
to
really
dissect
so
ill
say
its
herbaceous
with
a
twist
of
lime
oh
well
ive
had
better
but
this
isnt
terrible
in
any
way
just
not
my
taste
d
not
a
bad
brew
that
ive
got
here
nice
flavor
good
balance
doesnt
totally
stand
out
from
the
pack
though
about
to
go
after
the
2nd
glass
cant
wait
it
was
a
pain
in
the
butt
to
get
the
cork
out
of
this
with
its
metal
strap
when
i
finally
did
this
poured
much
lighter
than
id
expected
even
for
a
godlen
ale
very
light
yellow
with
a
fizzy
appearance
and
light
white
fizzy
head
the
aroma
is
damn
near
american
macrolike
starchy
and
stark
likewise
the
first
impression
of
this
beer
almost
suckers
me
into
thinking
american
light
lager
but
there
is
a
stronger
undertow
here
a
more
boisterous
cacophony
of
flavors
and
a
clearly
more
muscular
pull
that
develops
and
develops
and
develops
the
more
i
drink
quite
a
nice
strong
yet
beguiling
ale

pours
a
very
slightly
cloudy
golden
with
a
decent
pure
white
head
and
not
much
lacing
the
smell
is
fairly
light
and
surprisingly
pilsnerish
with
light
floralhops
and
light
tangy
malt
and
the
typical
lager
yeast
smell
the
taste
is
somewhat
similar
with
some
added
notes
of
light
banana
on
the
finish
and
some
pronounced
alcohol
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
light
and
creamy
could
be
slightly
crisper
for
my
taste
fairly
drinkable
but
a
little
boring
a
complex
and
enjoyable
biere
de
garde
and
my
first
for
the
style
reminiscent
of
a
dry
belgian
triple
with
a
lambic
flair
recommended
theres
a
hell
of
a
lot
of
stuff
going
on
in
this
beer
and
nearly
all
of
it
is
excellent
maybe
a
tad
bit
uneven
at
the
end
but
at
8
5
its
hard
to
imagine
packing
more
belgiany
goodness
into
such
a
moderately
sized
beer
nice
hazy
yellow
pour
with
big
cloudy
head
nice
lacing
no
real
malty
aromas
very
spicy
and
alcohol
is
there
slightly
odd
character
on
first
taste
and
there
is
a
dry
finish
with
a
touch
of
oily
hops
the
spices
overwhelm
and
do
well
to
cover
up
the
alcohol
content
not
too
yeasty
like
expected
but
there
is
a
tartness
from
the
maltphenol
combo
crisp
and
clean
with
some
great
and
unique
flavors
this
begins
with
a
nice
peppery
effervescence
imparted
by
the
fine
carbonation
flavors
are
a
mildly
sweet
fresh
pear
which
is
tempered
by
a
bit
of
acidity
the
barnyard
funk
from
the
aroma
doesnt
make
it
into
the
flavors
at
all
and
the
relatively
high
abv
is
expertly
masked
as
well
this
is
a
disturbingly
easy
to
drink
ale
seek
it
out
you
wont
be
disappointed
highly
carbonated
but
this
eases
up
after
a
while
making
the
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
better
for
me
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
a
good
beer
all
and
all
and
one
i
would
drink
again
if
offered
but
there
are
many
more
beers
i
would
rather
spend
my
money
on
a
unique
enough
taste
that
i
would
recommned
trying
this
one
originally
reviewed
on

750ml
wispy
aroma
of
tart
bananas
almond
paste
and
lemon
rind
wispy
and
very
sweet
smelling
phenolic
in
a
good
way
bright
pour
of
golden
hue
with
super
creamy
fine
froth
offwhite
flavor
is
a
bold
fresh
spicy
lemon
zinger
and
bright
white
teas
the
estery
attitude
bowls
over
the
rising
alcohol
notes
in
a
furious
percolating
battle
for
top
spot
the
gentle
pale
fruits
of
pear
wine
cinnamon
bark
plum
sauce
and
meyer
lemons
steep
in
a
sweet
syrup
a
floral
bouquet
grabs
the
sugars
and
balances
with
a
firm
slap
a
nice
rendition
with
great
complexity
smooth
drinking
and
lucious
character
cheers
the
carbonation
is
medium
strong
with
medium
sized
tickling
bubbles
d
the
high
carbonation
hinders
the
drinkability
but
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
drinkability
id
say
its
about
damn
time
i
decided
to
open
this
beer
up
i
dont
know
how
long
ive
had
this
but
its
been
at
least
a
couple
of
months
i
dont
know
what
i
was
waiting
for
but
im
glad
i
decided
to
open
it
if
you
can
get
past
their
wired
cork
then
youre
in
for
a
nice
treat
if
you
like
a
beer
than
can
turn
into
a
dry
white
wine
then
by
golly
pick
this
one
up
at
12
aud
this
is
very
good
value
would
make
a
more
than
suitable
substitute
for
a
chardonnay
at
the
meal
table
the
only
thing
i
ddint
really
like
about
this
beer
was
the
aroma
which
was
rather
dull
if
not
somewhat
offensive
a
great
beer
to
throw
in
between
more
complex
brews
like
abbey
and
pale
ales
or
stouts
not
utterly
complex
but
just
a
very
relaxing
tranquil
brew
with
just
enough
of
a
nectarysweet
feel
to
keep
you
interested
i
think
id
prefer
it
in
a
12oz
or
pint
bottle
but
ill
just
have
to
share
some
instead
pours
a
lovely
rich
golden
color
with
a
thick
white
head
initial
smell
and
taste
is
of
that
delicious
farmhouse
yeastiness
im
so
fond
of
in
jenlain
although
much
less
prominent
a
little
spicy
on
the
tongue
though
a
little
more
subdued
in
flavor
and
richness
that
other
bdgs
this
is
a
very
well
balanced
beer
extremely
enjoyable
almost
like
a
duveljenlain
hybrid
poured
to
a
golden
color
with
thick
white
head
that
dissipated
by
midglass
and
left
little
lacing
ironically
this
is
the
first
beer
ive
had
where
the
head
on
the
beer
inside
the
bottle
was
bigger
than
that
in
the
glass
aroma
was
grassy
floral
hops
the
flavor
was
more
of
the
same
but
a
malty
sweetness
crept
in
to
tame
this
down
and
leave
a
wellbalanced
smooth
finish
im
not
sure
why
this
brewer
chose
to
secure
their
beer
with
a
cork
and
huge
metal
staple
but
the
3
monts
made
removing
it
worth
the
work
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
very
nice
beer
im
not
too
into
this
style
so
i
dont
think
i
will
buy
it
again
very
much
3
monts
3
mountains
is
very
good
beer
even
though
i
havent
had
enough
examples
of
this
style
to
speak
with
great
authority
i
feel
pretty
confident
in
saying
that
this
one
can
hold
its
own
with
some
of
the
worlds
best
it
may
not
be
at
the
absolute
peak
but
the
biere
de
garde
summit
is
in
sight
aftertaste
is
alcohol
pepper
and
yeast
hop
d
one
bottle
pretty
well
made
me
drunk
in
a
dirty
way
i
wasnt
much
interested
in
any
more
after
that
pours
a
bright
yellow
with
a
fluffy
white
head
that
sticks
around
for
quite
a
while
smells
almost
a
bit
like
a
pilsner
urquel
those
hops
you
know
what
i
mean
doesnt
taste
much
different
either
a
lot
more
mouthfeel
heavier
body
and
a
bit
of
an
alcohol
bite
but
this
sure
tastes
like
a
relative
to
a
pu
doesnt
taste
as
interesting
as
the
bottle
looks
ther
color
is
pale
yellow
it
pours
with
a
lot
of
foam
and
bubbles
smelling
of
flower
and
spices
the
inital
taste
is
dominated
by
a
sweetness
alcohol
and
metal
its
followed
by
bread
and
citrus
and
a
dry
bitterness
in
sweden
we
have
a
kind
of
artificial
candy
called
foam
banana
and
this
taste
is
also
there
after
the
bottle
was
finished
i
walked
around
with
a
sour
taste
in
my
mouth
all
and
all
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
its
nothing
to
go
out
of
your
way
for
d
high
a
great
beer
i
could
drink
this
i
much
higher
volumes
if
youve
never
tried
this
but
have
seen
it
at
your
liquor
store
go
buy
it
now
noble
hop
flavor
and
complex
spicing
with
ample
carbonation
and
a
decent
malt
backbone
meh
its
good
id
like
to
get
my
hands
on
the
special
reserve
a
solid
beer
i
will
be
buying
more
in
the
future
im
enjoying
this
with
a
small
plate
of
edam
which
really
seems
to
bring
out
the
fruit
notes
in
the
beer
a
very
solid
beer
though
overall
this
is
my
first
bière
de
garde
i
think
the
bottle
might
have
been
a
little
old
maybe
i
would
have
been
more
impressed
with
a
fresher
bottle
i
do
like
the
complexity
that
isnt
present
in
other
styles
of
golden
beers
i
purchased
some
of
these
babies
at
a
piggly
wiggly
for
a
little
under
7
00
i
know
expensive
but
its
a
good
occasional
brew
i
am
new
to
biere
de
garde
and
i
now
am
in
love
with
it
it
is
in
a
brown
bottle
with
an
oblong
golden
label
and
an
annoying
metal
strap
ontop
of
a
cork
when
you
get
through
the
obstacle
course
of
entry
containing
the
mines
and
boobytraps
you
can
enjoy
this
tasty
beverage
i
poured
this
golden
ale
into
a
snifter
and
had
about
an
inch
of
head
that
leaves
pretty
quickly
the
carbonation
was
perfect
to
me
lots
of
bubbles
espcially
in
a
snifter
the
smell
was
great
like
honey
brown
sugar
medium
hops
and
a
goon
malty
smell
now
for
the
taste
this
is
a
good
beer
pretty
hoppy
and
almost
like
candy
pretty
sweet
but
not
overpowering
a
good
ratio
of
sweetness
kind
of
fruity
as
it
got
warmer
it
had
an
after
taste
of
an
apple
maybe
just
a
hint
of
a
delicious
golden
apple
also
as
it
warmed
i
noticed
that
the
warmer
it
gets
so
does
the
throat
most
likely
because
of
the
alcohol
which
is
very
evident
from
the
beginning
the
8
5
abv
will
creep
up
on
you
quickly
i
was
giggling
like
a
schoolgirl
after
about
2
in
a
row
this
is
a
great
beer
and
is
probably
now
one
of
my
favorites
i
like
the
beginning
the
middle
and
the
end
of
this
beer
well
not
the
end
because
that
means
it
getting
empty
but
you
get
the
point
i
highly
recomend
this
beer
to
anyone
i
dont
know
i
wasnt
really
crazy
about
this
beer
it
seemed
like
a
mellow
saison
mixed
with
bud
a
decent
beer
to
pair
with
certain
foods
but
id
probably
take
something
with
a
little
more
bite
next
time
3
monts
is
a
good
beer
but
i
doubt
id
drop
6
for
one
regularly
for
that
price
there
are
ones
i
prefer
more
if
you
could
buy
this
stuff
in
12oz
bottles
around
the
2
mark
id
be
all
over
it
that
said
it
is
absolutely
worth
trying
once
or
twice
and
makes
a
nice
treat
aroma
is
spicy
and
yeasty
with
a
bit
of
bread
poured
a
decent
frothy
head
with
good
lacing
the
head
soon
vanished
leaving
a
bright
yellow
clear
body
initial
flavor
was
sweet
and
acidic
that
become
moderately
acidic
the
body
was
light
to
medium
with
soft
carbonation
biere
de
gardes
arent
my
favorite
style
even
though
i
love
saisons
go
figure
i
think
i
dont
care
for
the
aftertaste
however
as
this
style
goes
this
is
good
representative
very
enjoyable
i
didnt
expect
to
like
this
one
so
much
d
all
in
all
this
is
a
delicious
easily
likable
and
addicted
beer
indeed
i
mean
perhaps
the
best
biere
de
garde
among
only
halfadozen
examples
ive
ever
tried
this
expired
beer
performs
so
well
that
i
could
only
dream
of
the
great
potentials
of
the
same
beer
that
is
slightly
younger
overall
an
excellent
biere
de
garde
up
there
with
the
best
somewhat
sweet
up
front
biscuit
baking
bread
some
more
anise
some
sublte
fruity
notes
herbal
hops
bring
it
home
with
a
flinty
dry
finish
medium
body
fine
carbonation
sublime
oelergud
marvellous
beer
highly
reccomended
i
think
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
very
refreshing
but
also
keeps
you
in
your
seat
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
bright
sparkling
gold
big
bubbly
radiant
white
head
that
quickly
dissipates
lots
of
complexity
in
the
aroma
spicy
and
grassy
grainy
and
sweet
very
earthy
and
sort
of
musty
tastes
initially
of
bitter
spicy
hops
becoming
more
grainy
and
producing
a
nice
little
sour
note
very
grassy
and
earthy
becoming
more
malty
as
it
warms
with
the
sourness
becoming
more
pronounced
and
lots
of
musty
barnyard
flavor
creeping
out
mouthfeel
is
light
and
airy
with
a
dry
finish
hugely
drinkable
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
complaints
the
lip
of
the
bottle
drips
while
pouring
it
otherwise
this
beer
is
difficult
to
fault

there

it
is
worth
copying
the

i
had
the
great
fortune
of
sampling
this
one
at
falstaff
near
the
bastille
in
paris
hopefully
this
fact
didnt
influence
the
following
review
appeared
a
clear

atop
which
rested
a
one
and
one
half
finger
foamy
head
plenty
of
carbonation
from
the

smell
was
of
sour
apple
and
grain
probably
wheat
taste
was
similar
sour
fruitiness
with
the
addition
of
spice
yielding
to
mouthfilling
feeling
of

little
light
on

this
was
a

juice
herbal

alcohol
touch

ginger
medium
mouthfeel
easy
to
drink
but
not
especially
compelling
its
possible
that
this
bottle
was
old
considering
the
lack
of
head
and
overlydeveloped
sweetness
a
real
suprise
i
was
expecting
more
along
the
lines
of
a
belgian
pale
ale
very
drinkable
the
abv
is
well
hidden
i
can
imagine
this
would
be
great
on
a
hot
day
well
i
like
this
beer
not
sure
if
im
going
to
get
it
again
anytime
really
soon
but
its
something
to
come
back
to
and
nice
to
try
for
sure

poured
a
golden

ale
with
a
huge
white
bubbly
head
with
great
retention
aroma
is
quite
particular
with
a
mix
of
spices
and
strong
sweet
floral
malt
taste
is
quite
reminiscent
of
a
belgian
ale
might
be
the
spice
and
the
sweet
malt
without
all
the
yeast
overall
this
is
probably
one
of
the
top
5
beer
from
france
but
not
as
great
as
the
bière
nouvelle
from
the
same
brewery
pours
a
brilliantly
clear
bright
gold
color
it
is
well
carbonated
which
holds
up
a
fluffy
thick
white
head
this
has
a
wonderful
sharp
herbal
grassy
aroma
with
noes
of
lemon
hay
and
vanilla
the
taste
is
lightly
tart
with
a
lemon
zing
to
it
it
is
just
so
light
and
refreshing
with
all
of
the
carbonation
this
beer
dances
across
my
tongue
the
finish
is
sharp
and
herbal
with
a
peppery
bite
from
both
the
carbonation
and
the
yeast
byproducts
in
fact
this
beer
is
quite
floral
in
some
ways
quite
dry
as
well
contradictorilly
this
has
some
the
nice
clean
notes
of
a
pilsner
crisp
malt
notes
up
front
which
compliments
the
other
flavors
quite
well
this
is
very
akin
to
a
dry
white
wine
perhaps
a
savignon
blanc
though
it
is
not
as
acidic
it
does
have
the
sharp
spicy
dry
fruit
that
a
sblanc
has
this
is
quite
good
and
quite
enjoyable
pours
out
a
clear
goldenyellow
color
with
a
big
head
that
took
a
while
to
settle
down
smell
consisted
of
yeast
malts
and
some
farmhouse
aromas
it
did
seem
a
little
light
though
but
perhaps
it
was
served
too
cold
taste
consisted
of
white
grapes
mostly
combined
with
some
spiciness
yeast
and
some
hops
show
their
strength
as
well
mouthfeel
was
nice
finished
a
little
dry
which
felt
nice
in
a
while
i
didnt
expect
this
beer
to
be
that
good
but
it
did
take
me
by
surprise
i
think
i
found
a
new
favorite
belgian
by
france
believe
it
mysterious
at
first
but
as
it
warmed
it
became
very
complex
light
grain
providing
a
caramel
sweetness
throughout
but
for
this
one
the
hops
dominate
dry
herbal
and
very
fruity
with
notes
of
lemon
especially
but
also
pears
and
honey
i
somehow
managed
to
enjoy
this
one
in
spite
of
the
pain
in
the
ass
metal
on
the
cork
someone
in
the
july
4th
thread
came
up
with
the
idea
to
have
a
french
beer
and
its
definitely
a
good
idea
i
admit
i
didnt
expect
much
from
this
one
but
im
surprised
how
well
this
one
turned
out
quite
good
and
i
would
enjoy
seeing
this
one
around
again

the
taste
has
a
nice
light
malt
background
lots
of
spices
up
front
some
more
fruity
characters
linger
but
the
spices
stay
throughout
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
strong
for
this
type
of
beer
for
8
5
the
drinkability
is
pretty
good
too
i
had
this
with
walleye
and
it
was
a
great
pairing
backwash
stands
along
with
the
grand
réserve
as
one
of
the
finest
beers
available
i
dont
care
if
one
calls
it
a
pale
ale
belgian
strong
ale
or
bière
de
garde
my
personal
choice
this
is
one
of
the
finest
bibulatory
experiences
you
can
find
the
extra
dryness
and
structure
of
the
grand
réserve
makes
it
a
better
match
overall
for
food
but
this
is
perhaps
better
for
rich
hors
doeuvres
like
the
cheese
charcuterie
and
grilled
meats
suggested
by
the
label
p
s
this
beer
works
amazingly
with
cheese
and
crackers
definitely
a
beer
to
pair
food
with
imo
the
taste
is
spicy
and
phenolic
and
largely
focused
on
the
yeast
as
it
warms
i
taste
more
yeast
and
then
alcohol
but
little
else
i
dont
even
get
much
of
a
fruit
malt
or
hoppy
taste
just
alcohol
and
yeast
which
i
normally
love
to
detect
in
my
beers
but
only
in
conjuction
with
other
flavors
of
course
yeast
and
alcohol
and
little
else
made
for
what
i
consider
to
be
a
rather
unbalanced
beer
the
head
is
thin
and
dense
nice
opaque
golden
color
the
smell
was
disappointing
as
i
couldnt
find
anything
but
some
skunkiness
the
taste
is
enjoyable
fruity
but
mostly
just
enjoyable
very
hard
to
define
the
alcohol
is
clearly
noticeable
the
hops
are
fruity
and
remain
subtle
the
brew
shows
some
hints
of
citrus
and
is
kind
of
refreshing
although
its
alcohol
content
makes
it
hard
to
be
a
good
session
beer
some
liquor
aspects
maybe
cherry
liquor
somehow
floury
its
good
but
i
think
i
expected
more
after
reading
other
reviews
i
could
sit
on
the
porch
drinking
this
all
summer
if
i
had
the
time
and
money
750
ml
bottle
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
fluffy
white
head
that
lasts
spicy
fruity
yeasty
aroma
spicy
and
peppery
apple
and
oak
flavors
more
hoppy
than
i
expected
medium
body
with
a
crisp
and
snappy
mouthfeel
finishes
very
dry
i
really
like
this
one
well
i
can
now
say
that
i
know
the
french
can
make
beer
and
its
definitely
not
swill
its
reasonably
flavorful
but
it
has
some
flat
spots
in
the
flavor
curve
never
jumping
out
and
asserting
itself
seemingly
content
to
be
just
ok
it
doesnt
offend
and
it
doesnt
amaze
rather
it
has
enough
character
to
stimulate
the
palate
but
not
to
wow
it
hey
its
better
than
just
mediocre
actually
approaching
good
but
coming
up
short
the
abv
does
its
part
in
limiting
the
drinkability
so
now
ive
tried
it
but
honestly
after
this
one
ill
likely
look
elsewhere
mild
malt
aroma
bitter
floral
hops
and
a
bit
metallic
sweet
aroma
fine
foamy
white
lacing
head
over
a

golden
clear

heavy
watery

with

carbonation
starts
moderately
sweet
with
light

alcohol
taste
some
sugar
finishes
with
good
bitterness
and
a
floral
hoppiness
after
is
medium
dry
bitter
with
some
fruitiness
this
beer
was
so
ridiculously
easy
to
open
i
mean
come
on
unwrap
the
foil
top
take
a
scissor
and
pop
the
staple
off
and
remove
the
cork
as
normal
is
that
so
hard
genius
lol
anyway
this
beer
pours
out
a
nice
light
blondeishgolden
colour
with
a
big
fluffy
white
head
of
foam
the
aromas
are
all
lemon
peel
various
spices
french
yeast
malt
hops
and
more
the
taste
is
zesty
hoppy
spicy
lemony
and
lovely
the
mouthfeel
is
soft
on
the
tongue
yet
sharp
and
warming
on
the
finish
the
drinkability
is
great
viva
la
france
ok
nobody
can
tell
me
that
the
french
cant
make
beer
it
takes
a
lot
of
trouble
opening
it
corked
with
a
swing
top
bar
i
couldnt
figure
it
out
cut
myself
trying
the
beer
was
worth
it
the
most
gorgeous
thing
ive
ever
seen
perfectly
clear
golden
color
with
a
large
pillowy
white
head
that
would
last
forever
as
if
i
would
wait
that
long
a
little
spiciness
with
some
vanilla
very
clean
tasting
very
light
in
body
worthy
of
being
one
of
the
worlds
top
beers
thanks
so
much
to
jcalbi
my
main
critizism
of
this
beer
is
the
cork
i
can
only
imagine
how
much
better
this
beer
would
be
if
it
was
crown
capped
and
the
drinkability
would
go
possibly
a
full
point
higher
if
it
was
without
it
i
think
one
really
needs
to
get
this
beer
fresh
to
enjoy
its
flavors
before
it
gets
interrupted
still
holds
its
own
with
some
of
europes
finest
tho
imho
normally
higher
alcohol
beers
improve
with
a
lowering
temperature
this
one
however
begins
to
show
all
of
its
weaker
characteristics
not
a
flattering
contrast
of
what
are
usually
a
good
combination
of
flavors
and
textures
it
is
what
some
american
breweries
have
done
to
pale
aletaken
away
all
subtlety
it
maintains
a
delicate
balance
between
creamy
and
spritzy
gloriously
gulpable
but
show
some
control
and
savor
this
one
man
what
nice
looking
beer
poured
a
brilliant
yellow
with
huge
rocky
headwatching
it
come
down
right
nowsmell
was
yeasty
and
slightly
fruity
the
taste
started
out
a
little
yeasty
with
some
slight
fruity
notes
ending
mineral
like
nice
complex
ale
even
better
than
what
i
thought
it
would
be
this
flanders
golden
ale
pours
a
real
gold
color
and
processes
a
fine
white
head
with
trickle
of
lace
a
complex
aroma
of
spicy
hops
faint
hint
of
malt
and
alcohol
fades
rather
quickly
the
medium
dry
malt
body
is
ever
so
lightly
sweet
is
fairly
grainy
the
mediumhigh
hop
content
is
spicy
with
a
sharp
grapefruit
edginess
the
fine
champagnelike
carbonation
tickles
the
senses
theres
some
noticeable
alcohol
but
it
fits
in
well
with
the
overall
flavor
scheme
the
flavors
separate
at
first
begin
to
blend
and
make
for
a
wellrounded
and
smoother
drinking
beer
while
remaining
somewhat
dry
throughout
strawcoloured
golden
and
clear
beautiful
foam
quite
perstistent
light
and
soft
herbaceous
more
than
floreal
the
smell
is
of
dry
grass
hay
the
flavour
is
typical
of
a
lager
beer
the
alcool
is
quite
perceptible
but
less
than
the
actual
abv
of
8
5
the
taste
is
characterized
by
bread
dry
pasta
well
balanced
with
good
notes
of
bitterness
the
body
is
full
and
the
aftertaste
is
bitter
specially
after
some
minutes
of
rest
this
is
without
a
doubt
the
hardest
cork
ive
ever
had
to
remove
i
advise
to
knead
the
edges
of
the
cork
with
your
thumbs
forcing
it
up
and
working
around
alternating
edges
twisting
it
off
doesnt
seem
to
work
very
well
it
finally
popped
off
violently
after
breaking
a
sweat
trying
to
get
it
off
the
beer
glows
a
brilliant
pale
gold
in
the
glass
the
flavor
is
very
subtle
i
picked
up
some
grassy
taste
along
with
a
alcohol
bite
it
reminded
me
of
some
of
the
lighter
unibroue
products
priced
about
the
same
as
unibroue
too
hints
of
goats
cheese
maybe
this
would
work
well
as
a
pairing
this
is
certainly
unique
the
cork
was
a
pain
in
the
ass
pours
the
color
of
your
average
lager
with
a
nice
large
white
head
the
aroma
is
strange
kind
of
like
musty
old
clothes
with
some
citrus
this
is
the
first
beer
ive
had
where
i
enjoy
the
taste
but
not
so
much
the
smell
the
taste
is
really
difficult
to
describe
but
ill
give
it
a
shot
ripe
pears
and
sour
apples
dominate
with
a
firm
sweet
malt
backbone
its
kind
of
dry
in
the
finish
and
has
a
definite
winelike
flavor
the
drinkability
is
awesome
but
dont
drink
it
too
cold
its
much
better
as
it
warms
up
a
little
give
it
a
try
when
you
want
something
different
very
enjoyable
a
nice

one

smell

taste
is
more
yeast
and
fruit
rather
prickly
and
carbonated
yet
creamy
in
the
mouth
an
excellent
balance
of
the
two
drinkability
is
quite
good
for
a
brew

its

nicely
with

any

that

love
it
and
im
making
an
effort
to
extend
my
appreciation
as
well
but
not
a
favorite
hail
to
beer
diversity
however
the
first
sip
was
shocking
earthy
and
bold
this
beer
had
a
mustiness
about
it
that
initially
i
thought
was
odd
add
a
hop
bitterness
and
low
key
tang
each
successive
draught
made
it
clear
that
3
monts
was
a
complex
farmhouse
type
ale
that
i
was
compelled
to
drink
like
licking
a
9
volt
battery
unpleasant
and
exciting
at
the
same
time
i
will
buy
3
monts
again
because
it
tastes
good
and
its
unique
this
beer
really
evokes
the
small
european
craft
brewery
vibe
that
makes
me
feel
all
warm
and
alive
well
i
am
never
dissapointed
by
this
brew

it

still
enjoyable

refreshing
i
will
have
to

this

you
will
not

will
be

well
the
simple

of
the

toasty
is
not
what
bothers
me
rather
the

boozy

get
a

in

a

sticky

enjoying

the

i

with

shining
through

aside
from

different
from

the
beer
is

some

the

alcohol
in

it
just
seems
a
bit
off
the
taste
brings
some
odd
funk
apples
soaked
in
booze
and
grain
mouthfeel
is
decent
assuming
you
can
get
past
the
odd
flavors
and
imbalanced
nature
of
this
unusual
beer
overall
not
a
repeat
for
me
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
an
average
fizzy
white
head
and
some
spotty
lacing
thin
cap
throughout
the
nose
is
light
and
smells
mostly
like
pilsener
malt
light
cardboard
and
bread
very
grainy
the
flavor
is
quite
grainy
as
well
light
body
and
no
contribution
from
yeast
or
hops
fizzy
carbonation
and
a
dry
finish
not
my
cup
of
tea
o
overall
i
wasnt
too
impressed
with
this
beer
didnt
hate
it
as
much
as
most
but
wouldnt
seek
it
out
again
beer
is
medium
bodied
and
has
a
grassiness
to
it
that
seems
like
an
offflavor
but
i
dont
mind
it
much
there
is
a
mildly
dry
finish
with
some
partially
sweet
beginnings
the
overall
experience
is
nice
but
i
dont
think
id
have
it
again
especially
not
in
front
of
anyone
else
due
to
overwhelming
amounts
of
shame
o
a
very
nice
beer
from
a
more
obscure
style
one
that
i
would
like
to
lay
down
for
a
bit
to
see
if
more
of
the
wild
flavors
come
out
o
its
a
french
tick
so
thats
something
the
beer
is
not
bad
and
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
not
something
id
go
after
again
though
with
better
options
always
available
d
its
not
the
most
interesting
beer
but
its
quite
easy
to
drink
considering
the
abv
probably
better
for
pairing
with
a
spring
feast
than
for
consumption
on
its
own
nothing
something
id
bother
with
again
but
a
pretty
painless
way
to
knock
of
france
if
youre
into
collecting
countries
on
here
this
has
improved
immensely
as
it
warmed
up
at
first
i
was
thinking
it
would
be
a
c
or
so
this
is
tasty
enough
and
complex
enough
to
enjoy
although
this
is
probably
not
a
beer
i
will
be
buying
overall
a
wonderfully
complicated
beer
from
begining
to
end
dnot
bad
different
than
i
expected
i
would
drink
this

i
am
not
enthralled
by
the
metal
ring
that
holds
the
cork
i
had
to
pull
out
a
screwdriver
to
get
it
off
it
was
not
terribly
convenient
however
once
i
made
it
through
that
process
i
was
presented
with
a
beer
that
poured
golden
yellow
with
great
clarity
about
three
inches
of
frothy
head
and
good
carbonation
and
lacing
the
aroma
boasts
a
wheat
element
and
a
vague
spiciness
akin
to
a
belgian
abbey
ale
the
body
is
creamy
and
bold
the
taste
was
generally
on
the
mellow
side
with
a
bountiful
wheatiness
creamy
maltiness
and
a
dry

a
pretty
good

no

no

factor
i
usually
revisit
this
one
every
fall
but
just
really
had
a
craving
for
it
so
i
opened
one
up
on
this
hot
summer
night
benchmark
for
what
i
consider
strong

an

to

followed
by

and
sweet

must
and
barn
and
a
hint
of
rum
soaked
raisins
and
of
course
the
sylvestre
signature
relatively
hoppy
eurohoppiness
taste
is
complex
and
well
balanced
and
im
really
seeing
the
similarity
to
its
belgian
counterparts
its
almost
like
a
semisweet
darker
roastier
and
spicier

medium
body
with
a
nice
slight
pricklyness
and

for
learning
about

style
drinkability
southampton
is
the
only
other
brewer
ive
found
that
could
match
up
with
the
quality
of
this
offering
and
that
effort
is
very
nontraditional
the
subtlety
and
balance
of
this
french
version
makes
this
a
classic
highly
highly
recommended
for
anyone
seeking
out
the
style
and
especially
for
a
firsttimer
a
mellow
and
enjoyable
beer
of
this
style
pretty
tasty
but
not
overwhelming
ive
got
some
goat
cheese
here
and
will
partake
of
both
immediately
the
palate
opens
with
a
moderate
hop
character
more
than
i
remember
the
regular
3
monts
having
quite
herbal
and
mildly
lemony
a
little
grassy
too
theres
a
delicate
undercurrent
of
spice
through
the
palate
with
a
little
pepper
along
with
a
light
honey
mildly
floral
all
of
which
are
carried
by
a
delicate
bready
character
dry
with
earthy
hops
on
the
finish
this
has
a
lingering
light
spice
character
light
in
body
with
high
carbonation
this
is
quite
prickly
on
the
tongue
just
a
touch
more
than
id
like
the
finish
is
wonderful
though
this
really
is
a
beer
that
i
would
love
to
serve
at
a
meal
excellent
stuff
d
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
as
the
alcohol
is
completely
masked
it
would
go
well
with
food
because
none
of
the
flavors
are
very
dominating
had
a
tough
time
opening
this
bottle
with
a
plastic

effort
d
i
really
liked
this
beer
had
an
ultrafine
balance
that
only
comes
from
superb
craftsmanship
you
dont
make
a
beer
this
delicate
on
dumb
luck
highly
recommended
the
taste
is
intricate
yet
mild
which
is
not
a
knock
against
the
beer
some
organic
earthy
notes
are
immediately
present
something
along
the
lines
of
wood
or
grass
it
is
balanced
by
a
sweet

note
the
carbonation
makes
for
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
which
is
a
definite
aid
to
the
taste
great
drinkability
great
beer
well
done
france
well
done
drinkability
this
beer
will
knock
you
over
if
you
dont
respect
it
the
8
abv
will
remind
you
however
this
is
one
smooth
brew
that
is
exceedingly
well
balanced
and
would
have
you
quickly
reaching
for
another
and
another
well
done
on
this
one
bottled
in
2000

drank
in
2004

the
bottle
opened
with
a
big
swish
and
poured
a
light
brownish
beer
with
a
huge
bubbly
head
with
excellent
retention
aroma
of
alcohol
with
a
mix
of
spice
carbonation
is
perfect
with
lots
of
bubbles
coming
back
on
top
of
my
glass
taste
is
a
mix
between
a
strong
belgian
ale
with
a
mix
of
a
good
well
aged
port
the
alcohol
is
mostly
sensible
in
the
aroma
but
undetectable
form
the
taste
overall
this
is
a
beer
that
aged
well
and
is
true
to
the
name
bière
de
garde
this
beer
poured
an
light
amber
color
with
a
massive
head
that
i
had
to
keep
scooping
out
with
a
spoon
or
else
it
was
going
to
run
out
all
over
the
counter
the
smell
was
malty
with
notes
of
fruit
caramel
and
bread
yeast
taste
was
impressive
with
flavors
of
caramel
jolly
rancher
candies
fruit
yeast
and
belgian
candi
sugar
i
could
notice
some
alcohol
bite
as
the
beer
warmed
this
beer
was
medium
bodied
and
very
easy
to
drink
almost
a
dessert
in
itself
it
reminded
of
a
lighter
version
of
a
dubbel
who
knew
that
the
french
could
make
such
a
tasty
biere
recommended
at
times
it
made
me
think
of
biting
into
a
caramel
apple
a
tasty
biere
de
garde
it
has
a
wide
array
of
flavors
and
aromas
with
an
emphasis
on
earthiness
wellbalanced
complex
and
very
drinkable
the
taste
had
a
monent
of
vanilla
goodness
wuth
a
citrus
finish
dthis
beer
has
a
very
soft
yet
complex
flavor
to
it
the
malt
is
really
the
star
of
the
show
and
there
is
not
a
great
deal
of
yeasty
characteristics
very
well
built
and
nice
maltyness
but
a
good
session

yeasty

and
hops

and
doughy
bready

the

away
your

mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
a
little
brash
but
spoton
drinkability
remains
intelligently
beautiful
another
marvelous
creation
from
these
french
farm
house
masters
this
is
my
second
bdg
oro
de
calabeza
was
my
first
but
i
thought
it
was
a
bspa
at
the
time
the
farmhouse
aromas
are
interesting
medium
bodied
amply
carbonated
and
dryly
satisfying
would
make
an
excellent
pairing
with
chesses
crisp
fruit
and
figs
pours
a
light
amber
color
with
lots
of
haze
and
a
moderate
head
that
leaves
plenty
of
lacing
on
the
glass
spicy
and
lemony
belgian
aroma
nice
the
flavor
is
quite
grainy
but
also
has
a
slight
hop
presence
and
a
very
light
but
fulfilling
body
drinkability
is
dangerously
good
on
this
one
this
beer
was
left
at
my
house
a
long
time
ago
and
its
about
time
to
drnk
it
the
beer
pous
a
hazy
paly
golden
color
with
a
3
finger
head
that
falls
to
coat
the
beer
the
nose
is
rather
nice
there
is
a
zesty
lemony
citrusy
character
along
with
a
spicey
belgian
type
character
almost
a
spicey
hop
quality
the
flavor
is
really
nice
it
gives
me
a
floral
flowery
essence
with
a
slightly
grainey
character
behind
it
this
is
a
hint
of
wood
in
there
as
well
slighty
tanninish
the
feel
is
moderate
to
thick
with
a
kight
carb
overall
a
rather
nice
beer
i
will
definately
look
for
this
in
the
future
very
quaffable
will
buy
again
for
some
special
dinners

that
sits
beneath

frothy
light
tan
head
that
creates

the
aroma
is
spicy
fruity
and
malty
with

this
has
quite
the
classic
bier

predominantly
malty
with
nice
complimentary
notes

fruit
and
spice
this
beer
is
well
carbonated
it
foams
effervescently
as
it
hits
my
tongue
for
the
first
time
the
taste
is
sweet
up
front
with
nice
fruity
notes
of
apples
but
then
moves
to
a
sharp
prickly
mix
of

my
only

about

closure
im
certain
after
tasting
a
batch
of
golden
ale
that
had
been
laid
on
its
side
for
a
month
that
this
composite
cork
only
does
bad
things
to
liquid
imparting
an
unattractive
mustiness
that
can
blur
with
well
an
attractive
mustiness
that
is
essential
to
the

one
of
the
finest

for
me
and
vastly
underrated
or
underknown
i
drank
this
particular
example
backtoback
with
a
regular
3
monts
frankly
i
dont
find
the
differences
that
substantial
id
compare
the
relationship
between
the
grand
réserve
and
the
standard
offering
as
the
difference
between
an
extra
brut
and
a
brut
champagne
although
both
are
less
dry
than
typical
champagnes

up
this
is
one
of
the
best
cellaring
candidates

one
of
the
greatest

was
served
from
a
difficult
750ml
corked
and
clamped
bottle
in
a
duvel
tulip
the
beer
was
a
hazy
orangecaramel
hue
and
was
topped
by
a
rich
thick
stiff
and
resiliant
light
tan
head
that
left
sheets
and
smatterings
of
sticky
lacing
decadent
currents
of
musty
dried
apricots
cloves
piney
resinous
hops
and
luxurious
scotch
wafted
from
the
glass
serving
to
invigorate
my
senses
on
the
palate
i
experienced
a
world
of
intruiging
and
wonderful
flavors
that
were
related
to
the
nose
dried
turkish
apricots
soaked
in
oakey
red
wine
grass
rosiness
and
licorice
these
flavors
swirled
and
bounced
with
joy
on
the
taste
buds
while
the
fantastic
sweeping
tannic
dry
lime
bitter
finish
rolled
through
leaving
lingering
vinous
apricot
notes
i
was
very
impressed
by
the
balance
and
composition
of
all
of
this
the
full
smooth
body
and
the
semifluffy
carbonation
were
matched
well
with
the
flavors
and
personality
of
this
beer
the
deliciousness
balance
and
dryness
of
this
brew
made
it
very
easy
to
drink
for
the
style
fullflavored
charismatic
and
captivating
a
highly
recommend
acquistion
the
show
was
however
popping
the
cork
allowed
the

to
spew
its
contents
in
just
about
every
direction

from

earthy
and
dank
feeling
lots
of
yeast
flavors
in
this
i
think
burnt
sugars
seem
to
squash
the
interesting
fruit
flavors
around
midpalate
the
flavor
of
carmelized
scrapings
from
the
bottom
of
a
baking
pan
still
quite
drinkable
and
pretty
good
but
this
isnt
nearly
as
great
as
the
original
in
my
opinion
again
thanks
to
jcalbi

may

getting
past
the
interesting
cork
arrangement
the
beer
poured
a
very
pretty
honey

with
a
rocky
eggshell
head
the
aroma
consisted
of
sweet
malt
and
peppery
perfumey
hops
before
it
warmed
up
a
bit
alcohol
was
too
big
of
a
flavor
once
it
warmed
everything
fell
into
place
bread
and
honey
on
the
palate
and
some
wood
american
oak
as
well
while
not
very
sweet
at
all
it
finishes
even
drier
very
complex
beer
and
beautifully
crafted
my
review
surely
does
not
do
it
justice
im
glad
the
store
was
out
of
the
regular
3
monts
and
i
had
the
extra
dollar
to
spend
on
this
one
heres
an
interesting

to

easy
to
drink
this
goes
great
with
food
a
truly
unique
brew
it
is
compulsory
that
you
appreciate
a
beer
whose

in

a
staple

thankfully
on

at

so
i
didnt
have
to
travel
to

overall
very
very
good
quite
complex
and
interesting
my
first
bière
de

or
any
french
beer
for
that
matter
and
if
this
beer
is
in
any
way
representative
of
the
style
its
going
to
quickly
become
one
of
my
favourite
varieties
overall
i
expected
to
be
wowed
by
this
but
its
pretty
decent
as
opposed
to
transcendent
im
not
super
familiar
with
the
style
but
this
seems
like
a
workmanlike
example
of
it
ointeresting
beer
enjoyed
drinking
it
but
dont
feel
i
would
seek
it
out
othough
it
is
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
the
bier
has
a
nice
medium
body
for
a
farmhouse
style
ale
leaves
a
nice

on

o
good

overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
and
at
8

alcohol
i
really
have
no
idea
where
theyre
putting
it
this
is
a
good
and
filling
beer
bold
and
assertive
beer
although
a
malty
brew
it
did
not
neglected
hops
still
they
are
the
supporting
actor
here
good
beer
for
temperature
decreases
remarks
did
not
score
a
t
s
m
at
that
time
disregard
those
scores
overall
a
little
on
the
pricey
side
but
when
factoring
what
you
are
getting
but
i
personally
am
not
disappointed
a
little
bit
of
everything
here
enjoy
and
drink
up
salud
this
was
a
really
enjoyable
beer
it
is
pretty
lightfeeling
despite
the
fact
that
it
is
pretty
stout
the
beautiful
head
is
the
best
part
in
my
opinion
but
on
the
whole
it
is
quite
delicious
would
definitely
drink
it
again
the
taste
did
remind
me
of
a
red
because
if
the
unique
bitter
maltyhop
character
and
there
was
a
kind
of
butterscotch
feel
to
it
it
wasnt
a
bad
beer
but
it
is
not
something
i
would
go
for
regularly
overall
not
a
bad
beer
id
drink
it
again
but
not
for
12
a
pour
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
complex
but
very
drinkable
worth
finding
a
beer
redolent
of
the
french
countryside
you
bet
unequivocally
the
best
part
however
is
the
relative
lack
of
yeasty
offsets
which
usually
seem
to
bleed
over
for
this
style
yet
do
us
the
favour
of
forgoing
that
altogether
here
leaving
us
with
a
pale
malty
kind
of
obscured
boozy
beau
of
a
bevy
if
youll
excuse
my
french
overall
i
was
really
expecting
something
different
from
this
brewery
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
but
it
is
very
sweet
and
that
aspect
overwhelms
the
other
things
that
could
otherwise
make
this
a
more
interesting
beer
overall
not
bad
i
understand
the
pride
that
goes
into
making
most
a
product
and
i
enjoy
all
the
different
styles
for
what
they
are
this
is
a
good
beer
o
not
really
sure
what
this
is
supposed
to
taste
like
kind
of
skunky
and
weird
the
taste
seemed
more
yeasty
than
the
smell
would
indicate
again
it
was
a
mixture
of
flavours
like
the
nose
the
alcohol
playing
its
part
too
originally
on
the
sweet
side
but
the
hops
kicked
in
midsip
and
the
finish
was
boardering
on
bitter
interesting
and
well
worth
finding
yet
another
french
beer
ive
enjoyed
dark
golden
raisins
chocolate
almonds
and
roasted
meat
are
all
delicious
pairings
this
is
a
complex
and
intriguing
brew
i
intend
to
pick
up
another

it

also
this

but
still
good
o
decent
bière

not
the
best
in
my
opinion
though
this
is
a
fine
relaxing
beer
that
warms
well
while
reading
a
nice
tribute
to
exuberant
youth
and
freedom
lost
o
quite
boozy
but
an
enjoyable
biere

nonetheless
overall
a
tasty
flavorful
bière
de

a
little
heavy
and
malty
for
my
taste
but
enjoyable
nonetheless
being
my
first
biere
de
garde
i
was
quite
surprised
at
the
flavor
profile
and
am
definitely
interested
in
having
another
overall
i
was
a
little
disappointed
as
this
one
was
a
bit
pricey
and
almost
didnt
get
it
not
bad
tasting
but
rather
very
lacking
in
taste
especially
compared
to
other
recent
biere
de

ive
had
new
to
texas
rotation
one
and
done
due
to
high
price
and
not
much
flavor
nn
an
enjoyable
beer
maybe
a
bit
too
much
carbonation
o
this
is
almost
like
the
red
ale
of
farmhouse
ales
a
delight
for
a
summers
day
on
the
farm
but
with
some
depth
and
heart
overall
its
approachable
but
not
overly
enticing
tons
of
white
head
almost
half
the
glass
at
times
and
a
clear
amber
body
notes
of
pepper
and
a
light
esters
with
a
deeper
sweetened
malt
backbone
not
bad
though
i
was
expecting
a
bit
more
in
terms
of
dryness
pepper
and
esters
to
be
at
the
forefront
without
such
a
malty
brew
glad
i
tried
it
though
i
am
not
sure
i
would
go
get
it
again
poured
into
a
nostradamus
flute
glass

a
clear
reddish
orange

active
carbonation
very
nice
fine
two

constantly
renewed
by
carbonation
high
retention
and
finally
left
massive

aroma
is
sour
light

a
faint

taste
is
quite
different
light
fruit
apples
pears
and
stone
fruit
slightly
tart
but
with
a
sweet
caramel
malt
backbone
very
interesting
finishes
rather
abruptly
with
crisp
slighlty
oxidized
fruit
and
sweet
slightly
toasty
malt
a
slight
hop
kick
in
the
finish
light
bodied
but
active
carbonation
gives
a
pleasant
spicey
mouthfeel
definitely
hits
all
the
biere
de
garde
notes
with
a
bit
of
a
belgian
yeast
suggestion
in
the
background
a
tart
but
not
overly
sour
ale
i
enjoyed
this
quite
a
bit
overall
exceptional
beer
theres
so
many
things
going
on
with
this
beer
but
its
all
in
such
tight
and
controlled
harmonious
balance
that
nothing
overwhelms
anything
else
so
deceptively
smooth
and
refreshing
outstanding
brew
o
not
a
total
standout
but
certainly
very
well
done
took
an
unexpected
turn
in
the
taste
texture
not
enjoyable
but
again
not
quite
delivering
on
some
of
the
sweet
promises
made
in
the
aroma
still
given
recalibrated
expectations
id
do
this
one
again
as
it
offered
something
unusual
overall
id
have
to
give
this
beer
near
perfect
scores
ive
had
it
several
times
over
the
past
year
and
each
time
i
have
enjoyed
it
more
each
time
when
i
dont
want
a
hop
bomb
like
and
ipa
a
gavroche
usually
comes
to
mind
i
had
this
at
the
winter
kraftbrew
beer
fest
in
san
jose
which
featured
mainly
porters
stouts
and
winter
warmers
when
i
tasted
the
gavroche
i
was
reminded
of
the
sesame
street
song
one
of
these
things
is
not
like
the
other
despite
my
palate
being
somewhat
muddled
by
the
darker
beers
i
felt
this
was
a
bright
light
beer
that
might
be
a
good
intro
into
lambics
im
not
a
fan
of
lambics
but
this
is
as
close
as
ive
come
to
one
that
i
liked
sweet
fruit
was
balanced
well
with
pale
malt
and
the
minimal
amount
of
hops
necessary
to
bitter
the
beer
definitely
open
to
trying
again
future
outlook
glad
to
have
tried
and
enjoyed
it
though
i
doubt
i
will
be
seeking
it
out
again
anytime
soon
overall
a
tasty
ale
if
i
hadnt
read
the
label
i
would
have
thought
that
this
was
either
a
flemish
sour
or
an
oud
bruin
from
its
appearance
definitely
the
most
unique
french
beer
i
have
had
in
quite
some
time
i
would
definitely
pick
this
one
up
again
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
deep
red
color
with
a
fizzy
cream
colored
head
on
top
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
pretty
earthy
to
me
i
thought
there
werre
some
light
roasted
notes
and
caramel
on
the
nose
the
taste
of
the
beer
was
semisweet
with
a
pretty
strong
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
was
pretty
good
it
had
a
medium
body
to
it
overall
its
a
decent
brew
from
france
d
incredibly
smooth
booziness
in
well
hidden
definitely
looking
forward
to
trying
brews
from
this
french
brewery
o
this
was
pretty
tasty
another
great
bottle
find
at
sycamore
d
not
very
tasty
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
good
kick
not
the
best
representation
of
style
not
a
beer
that
i
would
choose
again
as
there
are
others
that
better
in
the
style
o
an
interesting
tart
tad
funky
biere
de
garde
not
boozy
but
still
a
bit
tough
to
drink
a
ton
of
dr
high
abv
is
well
concealed
drinkability
is
decent
and
flavours
are
distinct
it
isnt
to
my
tastes
but
fans
of
the
flavours
will
enjoy
it
d
would
not
say
worldclass
but
this
is
a
very
well
executed
beer
that
stays
within
its
style
to
a
t
worth
the
price
tag
about
3
75
a
bottle
for
those
who
are
a
fan
of
the
style
very
drinkable
im
glad
i
bought
this
beer
it
was
quite
straightforward
and
generic
however
it
did
highlight
on
things
that
i
enjoy
in
a
beer
such
as
a
rich
sweet
malt
and
bubbly
carbonation
i
would
drink
this
beer
again
but
would
also
need
to
be
in
a
specific
mood
very
solid
beer
nice
malt
body
that
isnt
too
sweet
and
just
a
touch
of
the
earthy
funk
a
very
nice
red
ale
but
with
unusual
fruity
notes
spicy
notes
and
more
robust
malt
character
than
is
expected
all
these
are
welcomed
as
the
influence
of
brewing
traditions
from
ireland
belgium
england
and
france
converge
overall
the
flavors
present
in
gavroche
are
excellent
the
brewers
having
obviously
chosen
topquality
ingredients
and
used
them
liberally
the
brews
one
weakness
is
its
high
carbonation
which
in
addition
to
slightly
robbing
the
taste
makes
the
beer
feel
more
like
a
soft
drink
on
the
tongue
and
soft
palate
still
this
is
a
brew
to
be
reckoned
with
well
worth
trying
recommendation
from
joel
and
it
pours
a
golden
copper
hue
with
beautiful
carbonation
that
leaves
a
three
finger
creamy
head
with
dimples
that
stays
and
leaves
heaps
of
creamy
clingy
lacingthe
smell
is
prunesraisinsboiled
candy
and
dried
apricotsthe
mouthfeel
is
abit
light
for
my
liking
and
only
just
above
light
bodied
but
very
sessionable
and
has
tastes
of
raisinsmaple
syrupapricotsbready
malts
and
finished
with
a
candy
sweetness
and
overall
a
very
enjoyable
drop
with
its
high
abv
nowherre
to
seen
but
not
the
best
out
there
but
nice
netherless
not
at
all
a
bad
beer
o
the
first
time
i
had
this
beer
i
hated
it
this
is
quite
nice
actually
had
this
with
the
yeast
their
website
suggests
serving
it
without
the
yeast
a
very
interesting
beer
i
liked
it
a
hazy
rusty
dull
copper
with
an
enormous
soft
tan
foamy
head
there
is
an
slight
dome
of
foam
trying
to
resist
spilling
over
the
edge
of
the
tulip
glass
there
is
a
malty
alcohal
scent
and
some
nut
notes
on
the
nose
the
taste
is
earthy
with
some
honey
and
a
slight
boozyness
the
mouthfeel
is
heavy
and
somewhat
dry
this
is
not
as
good
as
i
remember
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
very
well
made
beer
it
was
not
anything
mind
blowing
or
overly
exciting
but
it
had
plenty
of
great
flavors
and
drank
very
well
o
this
is
a
meh
beer
for
me
it
could
be
the
style
or
it
could
be
the
bottle
not
sure
yet
but
i
guess
ill
just
have
to
try
a
few
more
to
find
out
o
i
really
liked
this
beer
champagnelike
effervescence
and
great
balance
between
malt
and
funk
makes
this
one
of
the
better
examples
of
its
style
an
interesting
sipping
beer
but
a
too
strong
to
say
its
highly
drinkable
overall
a
nice
introduction
to
the
style
but
i
think
ill
overlook
it
next
time
at
the
bottlo
conclusion
totally
different
from
the
other
biere
de
garde
that
i
have
tried
but
very
good
i
am
intrigued
by
this
beer
and
am
happy
that
i
picked
it
up
without
knowing
what
it
was
overall
comes
off
almost
like
an
american
strong
or
british
old
ale
very
bombastic
for
biere
de
guarde
but
tasty
none
the
less
big
but
balanced
intense
but
not
really
complex
would
probably
make
a
great
cellaring
project
drinkability
nice
i
will
definitely
be
coming
back
for
more
d
the
nose
and
appearance
are
this
beers
strong
suits
if
the
flavor
had
lived
up
to
the
nose
the
score
would
be
even
higher
overall
im
very
happy
i
grabbed
this
ws
d
stuff
is
quite
drinkable
the
8
5
is
just
slightly
noticeable
im
sure
a
nonexploded
bottle
would
shine
a
little
better
than
this
but
it
was
still
a
tasty
drink
d
very
tasty
and
the
alcohol
is
expertly
intergrated
would
love
to
try
more
examples
of
the
style
from
this
brewery
drinks
like
for
eight
and
a
half
percent
alcohol
by
volume
its
extremely
drinkable
it
was
a
pretty
nice
beer
with
the
smell
being
better
than
the
taste
i
may
get
another
someday
but
it
didnt
make
a
really
memorable
connection
with
me
other
than
the
glass
and
how
good
it
looked
in
it
it
pours
a
deep
amber
with
a
big
lasting
white
head
the
aroma
has
a
faint
soapy
fragrance
and
cellar
mustyness
that
gives
way
to
some
nice
floral
hoppy
note
the
flavor
is
mineraly
with
just
a
slight
grassy
sweetness
up
front
that
gives
way
at
the
end
to
a
tart
acidity
gavroche
is
an
extremely
light
and
refreshing
beer
with
little
co2
explosions
that
contantly
tickle
the
senses
hey
im
glad
i
tried
my
first
french
red
ale
i
recognize
the
quality
and
enjoyed
it
but
the
truth
is
its
not
much
more
than
just
any
beer
and
in
a
blind
taste
test
with
the
head
already
settled
down
i
would
have
had
no
idea
of
this
beers
foreign
pedigree
and
just
scored
it
a
little
above
average
d
not
really
what
i
was
expecting
in
this
style
has
its
good
points
but
not
something
id
revisit
i
liked
this
beer
but
this
type
of
beer
i
would
need
to
be
in
the
mood
for
the
earthy
flavor
really
hits
you
hard
pours
a
perfectly
clear
reddish
orange
with
a
decent
enough
head
the
aroma
is
fruity
and
deeply
nutty
with
some
root
herb
the
hoppiness
is
both
bright
and
earthy
the
aroma
is
rye
bread
and
some
mild
fruity
sweetness
overall
this
beer
is
nicely
dry
and
has
some
complimentary
pear
and
peppery
notes
the
carbonation
is
lively
o
a
very
drinkable
beer
not
super
complex
but
has
some
interesting
maltderived
flavors
d
the
beer
is
quite
drinkable
due
to
its
balanced
taste
and
interesting
flavors
i
would
definitely
try
this
again
d
drinks
pretty
well
for
its
abv
this
beer
definitely
has
enough
flavour
and
body
to
be
enjoyable
reminds
me
of
other
beer
styles
like
red
ale
brown
ale
and
dubbel
final
thoughts
this
beer
and
i
suspect
this
style
reminds
me
very
much
of
trappist
beer
specfically
chimay
red
and
blue
its
nice
but
its
not
something
id
regualarly
buy
i
would
recommend
it
though
an
interesting
take
on
the
biere
de
garde
style
easy
to
drink
and
enjoy
but
beyond
that
nothing
really
complex
to
report
about
very
interesting
beverage
i
dont
think
i
would
use
this
for
casual
drinking
but
it
would
be
very
good
with
food
absolutely
nothing
like
a
3
monts
but
still
well
worth
a
try
drinkability
is
low
here
should
be
more
flavorful
and
easy
to
drink
another
great
find
from
premier
im
glad
i
could
get
my
hands
on
this
style
in
terms
of
comparisons
i
drew
a
lot
of
similarities
with
a
gruit
beer
mainly
the
pronounced
herbal
earthy
tealike
characters
based
on
this
beer
alone
i
wouldnt
say
this
is
my
favorite
style
but
it
has
still
left
me
looking
forward
to
their
3
monts
i
have
in
my
fridge
d
having
never
heard
of
this
beer
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
well
done
this
is
a
daily
drinker
not
so
precious
that
you
have
to
savor
every
drop
but
keeps
rewarding
with
a
complex
array
of
notes
i
did
not
see
any
yeast
residue
but
the
last
glass
poured
definitely
had
more
of
a
yeasty
note
than
the
first
poured
into
my
zatec
fluted
glass
nice
amber
color
with
a
huge
growing
head
about
4
fingers
high
sponging
lacing
with
great
retention
smells
a
bit
nutty
malty
with
some
nice
floral
aromatic
hops
cascade
flavor
is
definitely
bringing
the
nuts
and
hops
almost
starts
off
tasting
like
a
mild
sour
this
beer
changes
drastically
as
it
warms
nice
bitter
and
dry
finish
very
drinkable
for
8
5
abv
the
french
are
bringin
the
pain
with
this
one
great
representation
of
style
d
this
is
a
stellar
beer
i
enjoyed
every
sip
and
will
probably
have
to
buy
another
one
to
me
this
is
analogous
to
a
kristalweizen
being
clean
hefe
another
nice
biere
de
garde
from
st
sylvestre
though
not
my
favorite
nevertheless
it
is
still
a
tasty
one
and
if
youre
fine
with
all
the
carbonation
a
hoppier
beer
of
this
style
too
an
interesting
strange
beer
reviews
are
telling
everyone
seems
to
experience
this
beer
differently
bottle
variance
carbonation
is
too
high
only
further
deteriorating
that
dry
finish
is
it
a
coincidence
that
the
label
on
the
bottle
actually
looks
like
a
wine
label
terrific
mouthfeel
very
smooth
and
almost
creamy
in
the
mouth
carbonation
is
somewhat
low
and
this
drinks
very
very
nicely
especially
at
85
very
drinkable
one
of
the
best
french
beers
i
have
had
to
date
in
all
not
a
keeper
but
wouldnt
turn
it
down
i
really
enjoy
the
biere
de
garde
stylethis
seemed
to
be
out
of
that
category
in
its
traits
poured
a
hazed
lighter
amber
shade
with
a
huge
blooming
white
head
that
never
settled
aromas
of
pilsner
malt
with
a
faint
leafy
notenot
really
a
whole
lot
going
on
flavors
are
dryish
and
lightly
toasteda
bit
of
freshly
baked
bread
in
the
finish
does
not
seem
that
it
could
be
8
5abv
its
rather
light
eh
i
was
expecting
morethere
are
many
better
of
the
style
good
drinkability
a
bit
bland
overall
but
easy
to
drink
and
goes
down
easily
d
yes
would
drink
again
i
think
the
combination
of
its
taste
and
mouthfeel
makes
it
a
good
beer
for
me
fresh
good
drop
d
nice
and
tasty
very
good
to
drink
although
alcohol
would
prevent
multiples
in
a
sitting
33cl
bottle
this
one
pours
a
slightly
hazy
amber
color
there
was
a
fairly
big
ecru
head
that
dropped
away
rather
quickly
the
aroma
is
nice
it
is
somewhat
bready
with
some
faint
caramel
malts
some
faint
fruits
in
there
also
as
well
as
a
light
amout
of
earthy
hops
it
is
a
bit
tingly
on
the
tongue
some
dark
fruits
caramel
and
a
dryness
in
the
finish
pretty
decent
d
this
one
was
a
bit
of
a
chore
to
struggle
through
doubt
id
get
another
one
an
overall
great
beer
that
is
belgian
in
style
and
complexity
even
though
its
a
french
beer
clearly
the
belgian
influence
has
dominated
the
taste
of
this
beer
which
i
am
thankful
for
it
went
down
so
nice
and
easy
that
i
had
a
second
with
dinner
the
gotham
bar
and
grill
in
nyc
interesting
beer
but
not
one
i
think
i
will
try
again
for
one
thing
it
is
far
drier
than
i
expected
and
secondly
it
is
underflavored
to
me
a
very
well
made
beer
with
vast
character
and
a
degree
of
freshness
or
house
character
that
has
in
my
opinion
been
lost
in
many
larger
belgian
style
brewhouses

thanks
eric
thanks
eric
for
busting
out
the
bottle
nice
brew
not
something
i
would
drink
regularly
but
a
nice
surprise
not
a
hint
of
the
alcohol
easy
drinking
d
i
was
expecting
this
to
be
a
french
red
ale
but
was
pleasantly
surprised
being
that
i
wasnt
a
huge
fan
of
my
first
encounter
with
the
style
i
will
definitely
seek
this
one
out
again
takes
multiple
pours
to
get
it
all
into
the
glass
once
finished
it
has
a
nice
deep
amber
color
with
a
thick
beige
head
that
lasts
for
a
good
amount
of
time
smells
a
little
bit
fruity
like
apples
however
the
scent
isnt
too
strong
taste
is
a
mix
of
bitter
hops
and
fruit
it
goes
down
pretty
smoothly
with
a
slight
tingle
on
the
tongue
when
it
first
touches
the
mouth
overall
a
good
beer
from
france
which
is
somewhat
surprising
for
a
country
mostly
known
for
wine
champagne
and
cognac
overall
not
a
very
drinkable
brew
definitely
a
slow
sipper
that
you
will
want
to
allow
to
warm
before
drinking
an
interesting
mesh
of
a
biere
de
garde
and
a
flanders
red
but
still
leaves
something
to
be
desired
a
shame
about
the
gusher
knocked
off
on
the
appearance
score
just
a
little
this
is
a
bit
too
sweet
to
drink
a
lot
of
or
to
drink
it
often
but
im
definitely
enjoying
this
im
going
to
have
to
check
out
some
other
french
beers
im
impressed
notes
had
no
earthly
idea
what
to
expect
from
this
beer
i
bought
it
simply
because
it
was
from
french
flanders
stunning
beer
wish
we
could
get
it
here
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
a
session
beer
too
this
is
a
damn
good
beer
i
dont
notice
the
8
5
abv
i
drank
this
beer
as
fast
as
i
would
a
4
abv
kolsch
or
hefeweizen
d
not
really
the
wine
flavour
is
just
too
over
powering
maybe
it
needs
a
bit
of
age
light
fruity
aftertaste
the
taste
is
lacking
any
definition
very
mild
malt
with
some
metallic
notes
not
great
not
bad
heavy
and
well
carbonated
a
nice
summer
type
ale
but
lacking
any
distinction
not
a
great
one
for
this
style
much
better
ones
out
there
a
big
let
down
from
the
appearance
overall
this
was
a
beer
that
i
enjoyed
but
im
still
trying
to
fully
appreciate
biere
de
gardes
so
maybe
i
didnt
enjoy
it
as
much
as
i
should
have
given
the
style
still
its
worth
a
shot
with
an
abv
of
8
5
you
are
above
average
for
this
style
of
beers
so
be
warned
if
you
consume
many
in
a
row
i
didnt
notice
the
abv
until
after
id
finished
it
and
i
was
surprised
it
was
so
high
its
a
nice
beer
a
dusty
dry
but
refreshing
brew
this
is
interesting
but
right
now
it
is
not
for
me
maybe
this
will
grow
on
me
as
i
try
this
a
couple
of
more
times
great
beer
very
clean
and
smooth
pours
a
burnt
copper
with
a
towering
eggshell
head
the
foam
eventually
dies
down
to
leave
some
lacing
on
the
tulip
smells
nice
malt
with
a
light
farmhouse
yeast
presence
a
bit
of
spice
taste
is
quite
malty
though
it
lacks
the
sweetness
that
normally
accompanies
theres
actually
a
dry
tartness
with
a
dry
finish
quite
nice
though
its
not
my
favorite
this
is
a
nice
bière
de
garde
all
in
all
a
very
solid
beer
i
certainly
wont
hesitate
to
finish
off
the
other
4
in
the
fridge
when
the
urge
strikes
this
is
a
nice
beer
flemish
in
character
but
from
france
called
a
red
but
really
more
of
a
dark
golden
trending
toward
amber
color
bright
frothy
head
with
gripping
lace
smell
is
fairly
mild
with
a
tartness
that
forecasts
the
coming
flavor
brisk
and
fulfilling
on
the
mouth
bright
carbonation
and
a
blast
of
flavor
nice
well
rounded
beer
tart
but
in
the
most
subdued
way
a
nice
easy
drinking
beer
if
it
was
cheaper
it
could
be
an
everyday
sort
of
thing
highly
recommended
to
those
who
like
a
sour
but
dont
want
to
be
totally
dried
out
taste
a
nice
roasted
malt
complex
it
is
thick
and
syrupy
with
hints
of
citrus
molasses
esters
and
yeast
the
beer
would
be
fantastic

reddish

slithly

a
huge
fizzy
cream

aroma
of
barnyard
malt
straw
sharp
hops
and
grains
full
body
taste
of
earthy
hops
with
an
oaky
finish
that
lingers
really
different
but
very
easy
to
drink
and
enjoyable
perfect
on
a
fall
evening
drinkability
is
better
than
i
expected
for
the
style
alcohol
is
wellhidden
and
it
would
be
enjoyable
whether
it
was
80
degrees
or
snowing
a
wonderful
lively
mouthfeel
with
a
lot
of
active
carbonation
but
not
too
heavy
in
the
body
moderate
with
a
slightly
watery
finish
making
this
amazingly
refreshing
another
huge
hit
with
me
from
the
sylvestre
clan
in
france
my
only
major
critique
of
this
beer
is
that
its
just
a
bit
too
strong
some
of
the
stouts
that
ive
had
lately
had
less
feel
of
alcohol
in
them
even
though
they
were
actually
stronger
than
this
no
matter
this
is
very
well
crafted
beer
and
quite
worth
the
chance
i
took
on
it
for
3
99
a
bottle
it
doesnt
get
any
better
than
this
d
an
unusual
ale
that
i
enjoyed
very
much
its
unique
flavor
profile
would
probably
limit
me
to
one
or
two
at
a
sitting
but
i
still
consider
it
to
be
a
very
drinkable
beer
d
this
beer
is
a
bit
dull
with
not
many
flavors
and
those
that
are
there
are
not
very
interesting
especially
at
this
price
point
i
was
expecting
at
least
a
little
flavor
appearance
is
orangecopper
with
soapy
sloppy
head
taste
and
smell
are
of
slightly
sour
apple
tart
with
roasted
malt
spicy
with
a
tingle
virtually
no
hop
presence
but
finishes
spicy
alcohol
completely
hidden
deeper
apple
character
like
cidre
or
stewed
apple
as
well
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
high
due
to
fuller
almost
chewy
consistency
and
crisp
lingering
lively
acidity
not
worth
the
9
99
a
4pk
though
it
tastes
just
ok
but
it
is
very
disappointing
considering
the
brewery
a
forgettable
effort
pours
a
clear
orangered
color
with
a
one
finger
white
cloudy
head
that
fades
quickly
to
a
very
thin
head
that
remains
throughout
the
beer
deep
fruit
cherry
oak
aromas
flavors
of
chocolate
malt
up

light
smoke
with
a
very

of
different
flavors
come
through
making
this
an
interesting
beer
d
this
is
a
really
flavorful
beer
with
some
very
interesting
complexity
its
quite
a
nice
treat
however
i
find
it
a
bit
sweet
to
have
more
than
one
in
a
setting
sweet
malty
and
berry
aroma
with
presence
of
yeast
flavour
is
very
complex
roasted
dry
malt
with
spicy
berry
almost
no
bitterness
and
the
presence
of
alchohol
can
be
felt
mouthfeel
is
creamy
pleasant
warming
and
long
lasting
lightly
sweet
and
roasted
aftertaste
d
very
drinkable
im
going
to
have
another
right
now
spicy
and
warming
the
higher
alcohol
level
is
evident
but
the
puckering
slightly
astringent
italianlike
spices
balance
this
well
overall
this
is
a
malty
beer
with
little
notable
hop
solid
body
with
a
lower
carbonation
level
than
the
head
would
indicate
really
pretty
in
the
glass
nice
deep
gold
not
so
much
of
the
red
hue
ive
heard
others
mention
with
a
tall
frothy
head
that
you
have
to
drink
through
with
the
first
few
sips
malty
with
a
nice
subtle
hops
in
the
nose
decent
mouthfeel
with
delicate
carbonation
unfortunately
the
taste
was
disappointingand
a
result
of
the
higher
abv
as
similar
ales
go
this
is
a
good
one
but
the
alcohol
hits
you
immediately
then
lingers
as
an
astringent
aftertaste
definitely
not
a
session
beer
i
prefer
something
where
the
alcohol
sneaks
up
on
you
this
one
hits
you
in
the
face
smooth
drinking
not
too
harsh
despite
the
abv
a
nice
sipper
d
went
excellently
with
a
cheesesteak
heh
refreshing
and
the
constrast
between
the
beer
and
pretty
much
everything
a
normal
person
would
eat
is
enjoyable
good
variety

subdued

this

certainly

it

if
ever
finishing
the
4pack
was
a

final
thoughtsthis
is
a
great
beer
that
i
really
cant
compare
to
anything
ive
had
before
seek
this
one
out
and
enjoy
something
that
comes
from
france
m
mediumfull

well
carbonated
which
makes
for
a
very
drinkable

all
wrapped
up

tastes
a

with
some
breadiness

a
slight

feel
before
it
goes
down

there
is
a
very
slight
alcohol
burn
at
the
end
medium
to
fullbodied
and
fairly
active
my
first
thought
upon
the
pour
was
that
it
was
almost
bubbly

a
very
nice

think
i
would
be
at

oxbow
beer
i
dont
like
it
as
much
as
some
of
their
other
offerings
but
it
is
well
made
and
an
interesting
combination
of
styles
a
lot
of
fun
to
drink
d
something
about
the

the
slight

threw
me
off
not

o
overall
this

i
dont

a

percent
beer
this
morning
is
just
right
an

from
now
i
will
require
7

like

clean

this
is

may
be

maltier
than
you
are
used

but
it
is
still
quite
enjoyable
it
is
worth
seeking
out
if
you
find
yourself
here
in
maine
the
beer
is
another
tasty
oxbow
offering
but
not
my
favorite
o
overall
pretty
nice
nice
malts
some
solid
farmhouse
funk
all
solid
and
subtle
not

sweet

super
drinkable

from

overall
pretty

especially

good
yeast
additions
although
could
be
just
a
bit
crisper
and
drier
decent
hops
too
very
drinkable
for
a
4
beer
its
loaded
with
flavor
very
tasty
cheers
i
like
the
low
alcohol
i
feel
like
this
might
be
closer
to
what
the
style
was
actually
like
way
back
when
so
i
give
them
points
for
that
the
murky
look
kind
of
adds
to
the
effect
to
bad
its
6
a
pint
or
i
would
have
several
i
just
came
from
the
pineland
farms
trail
running
festival
and
a
beer
that
smells
like
hay
and
sunburn
fits
my
mood
perfectly
my
first
oxbow
so
far
so
good
overall
really
quite
nice
this
combines
two
of
my
favorite
things
saison
yeast
and
session
beers
great
idea
and
very
well
executed
o
tastes
much
lighter
than
it
looks
but
full
of
flavor
this
beer
would
be
great
with
lunch
or
at
the
end
of
the
work
day
just
before
dinner
this
was
my
first
try
for
this
brewery
and
im
pretty
impressed
this
isnt
a
common
style
but
this
beer
is
an
example
of
the
style
done
well

from
my
tasting
notes
it
was
a
reddish
copper
color
with
a
belgian
yeast
and
dark
fruit
aroma
the
taste
was
sweet
caramel
malts
fruit
and
belgian
yeasts
with
a
slight
earthy
tang
it
was
more
subtle
than
the
shlafly
biere
de
garde
but
with
enough
complexity
to
keep
me
interested
and
coming
back
for
more
the
scrachin
hippo
was
great
and
puts
adelberts
firmly
on
my
radar
pours
a
murky
orangebrown
with
a
foamy
bone
head
that
settles
to
a
small
cap
on
top
of
the
beer
small
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
grain
yeast
and
spice
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
grain
and
caramel
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
spice
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
is
drinkable
but
nothing
too
memorable
o
reminds
me
of
an
esb
somewhat
not
as
bitter
and
more
malty
i
expected
more
complexity
maybe
i
missed
it
certainly
worth
a
try
if
you
get
a
chance
overall
a
beer
that
is
woefully
undercarbed
and
poor
tasting
doesnt
exactly
win
me
over
where
are
they
scratchin
that
hippo
pours
out
a
nice
deep
hazy
brown
with
reddishamber
hues
toward
the
outer
area
of
the
ale
its
topped
off
with
a
thick
white
bubbly
head
that
sticks
around
for
some
time
its
got
thick
lacing
too
the
aroma
is
dry
very
fruity
apples
grape
and
berries
come
through
very
well
mildly
tart
it
is
medium
bodied
some
spices
do
come
through
cleanly
phenolic
alcohol
tastes
pretty
good
and
is
accompanied
by
mild
bready
flavors
some
fruit
flavors
do
come
through
there
is
a
mild
hop
flavor
in
the
aftertaste
but
it
is
barely
detectable
this
is
a
very
good
beer
and
it
goes
down
very
smooth
decent
and
quite
drinkable
a
unique
interpretation
of
the
style
glad
i
got
to
try
it
without
flaw
but
unexciting
poured
from
a
12
oz
short
bottle
into
a
goblet
glass
this
pours
a
slightly
hazy
tea
color
with
a
large
off
white
head
which
has
good
retention
the
smells
are
of
citrus
a
little
funk
the
feel
is
medium
very
high
carbonination
the
taste
is
okay

bottled
on

purchased
at
specs
in
austin
texas
the
taste
was
practically
more
of
the
same
mostly
citrus
with
some
young
tree
bark
thrown
in
its
got
good
yeast
character
that
gives
it
an
excellent
mouthfeel
and
some
character
that
prevents
it
from
being
thin
citrusy
nastiness
but
im
not
getting
much
malt
character
and
earthiness
meh
its
just
fruity
primarily
on
the
citrus
side
surprisingly
freshtasting
citrus
at
that
considering
that
it
was
brewed
6
months
ago
that
didnt
seem
to
mellow
it
any
im
going
to
have
to
not
suggest
this
if
youre
looking
for
citrus
but
with
body
in
a
way
that
works
oddly
well
go
for
it
but
if
you
want
malty
and
earthy
like
it
claims
to
be
dont
expect
much
750ml
corked
and
caged
the
way
god
intended
very
assertive
pop
of
the
cork
this
beer
wants
to
be
drunk
i
know
how
it
feels
it
is
hazy
copper
with
a
big
head
that
settles
into
a
rocky
sticky
off
white
it
smells
of
bananas
brown
sugar
hay
and
vanilla
the
taste
is
wood
leather
biscuity
and
a
dry
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
tingly
and
sticky
and
i
know
theres
a
joke
in
there
somewhere
overall
its
a
very
good
beer
good
flavor
not
quite
as
refreshing
as
i
tend
to
imagine
when
i
think
of
this
style
but
more
interesting
at
the
same
time
this
hippo
can
scratch
me
any
time
that
is
what
the
kids
are
calling
it
these
days
right
o
i
would
probably
rate
it
higher
after
my
second
bottle
in
the
future
it
is
easy
to
drink
even
thought
it
is
my
first
biere
de
garde
ale
good
job
adelberts
watch
out
its
explosive
the
pour
itself
is
a
burnt
orange
sort
of
color
with
a
tall
white
head
the
nose
is
much
sweeter
than
expected
lots
of
sweet
malt
and
fruit
notes
with
a
bit
of
yeastiness
quite
a
lot
of
apple
to
it
the
flavor
is
heavy
on
the
sweet
sugar
and
malt
notes
lots
of
apple
and
pear
fruit
notes
maybe
white
grape
and
a
hint
of
banana
there
is
a
mild
yeastiness
too
really
an
odd
though
not
unenjoyable
beer
if
youre
a
fan
on
belgians
especially
duvals
this
is
for
you
its
got
nice
almondcaramel
notes
but
it
still
has
that
signature
belgian
bitterness
adelberts
brewery
maybe
a
young
brewery
but
it
sure
as
hell
knows
what
its
doing
id
definitely
buy
a
six
pack
if
they
sold
them
at
my
local
store
spicy
like
your
grandmas
lazy
susan
its
pretty
too
with
its
perfect
little
bubbles
and
dark
honey
color
very
appetizing
big
malty
candy
bar
smell
blends
well
with
lazy
susan
effect
i
havent
a
clue
what
spices
they
all
seem
to
form
one
coherent
spice
profile
bubbly
going
down
and
no
residual
stickiness
impressive
ill
buy
more
once
the
beer
calmed
down
a
bit
it
pours
a
clear
orangeamber
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
has
a
good
bit
of
coriander
and
pepper
as
well
as
some
toffee
and
orange
citrus
notes
the
flavor
has
quite
a
bit
of
toffee
and
caramel
as
well
as
some
strong
belgian
yeast
notes
there
is
also
a
hint
of
coriander
the
carbonation
is
way
too
high
and
the
mouthfeel
is
about
medium
not
sure
what
this
would
taste
like
if
the
carbonation
was
normal
but
i
think
it
would
probably
be
better
im
lowering
the
overall
score
on
account
of
the
fact
nearly
half
the
beer
went
down
my
drain
and
the
cork
launch
terrified
my
sleeping
cat
eenie
o
have
now
had
this
beer
on
draft
and
in
bottle
and
i
just
dont
get
it
does
get
a
bit
better
as
it
warms
cheers
to
a
new
austin
brewery
corked
and
caged
750ml
bottle
cork
comes
out
quickly
with
a
loud
pop
this
thing
is
crazy
carbonated
and
a
borderline
gusher
head
hasnt
quit
coming
out
of
the
top
of
the
bottle
the
pour
is
dominated
by
head
but
has
a
nice
amber
orange
color
to
the
pour
great
looking
beer
after
it
settles
down
really
nice
head
retention
smell
band
aid
funk
nice
breadiness
brown
sugar
candied
sugar
i
theorize
that
the
carbonation
issues
either
come
from
yeast
gone
wild
in
the
bottle
conditioning
process
too
much
fermentation
process
in
the
bottle
or
some
sort
of
infection
tight
white
bubbles
are
visible
on
top
of
the
beer
it
reminds
me
of
what
some
of
my
favorite
wild
ales
look
like
band
aidplastic
smell
appears
more
after
the
head
settles
down
taste
band
aid
stingy
carbonation
this
lacks
backbone
i
wanted
to
have
some
sort
of
malt
presence
but
all
i
get
here
is
a
watery
presence
i
burped
got
hardcore
band
aid
this
beer
is
not
good
i
will
blame
it
on
the
bottle
being
apparently
infected
but
im
not
sure
i
will
give
it
another
chance
gross
overall
glad
to
see
another
texas
brewery
on
the
scene
and
i
hope
to
try
more
of
their
beers
in
the
coming
weeks
but
this
one
isnt
for
me
avail
here
in
tx
obviously
rotation
one
was
enough
nn
not
bad
but
a
one
and
done
for
me
there
are
much
better
belgian
interpretations
from
texas
no
less
and
around
the
world
available
o
a
very
nice
beire
de
garde
a
remarkable
beer
for
so
young
a
brewery
overall
mild
for
the
style
not
particularly
interesting
but
its
pretty
darn
tasty
and
easydrinking
to
boot
im
not
sure
id
pick
it
up
regularly
but
i
might
snag
one
on
tap
now
and
again
this
is
a
light
maltyamber
color
with
thin
lacing
around
the
top
theres
a
slight
funky
tart
aroma
hop
bitterness
hits
you
up
front
the
biere
de
garde
tartness
comes
through
on
the
palate
with
a
lingering
finish
theres
a
pleasing
maltiness
that
becomes
more
apparent
as
it
warms
this
beer
has
a
bitterness
and
an
edge
which
makes
for
a
nice
contrast
with
the
malt
flavor
as
it
warms
slightly
funky
too
while
remaining
easy
going
effervescent
and
filling
this
was
a
wholly
forgettable
offering
ill
have
to
try
more
beers
in
the
future
but
this
initial
offering
makes
me
wonder
how
long
theyll
be
around
t
good
dubbel
profile
with
a
nice
lively
tangy
acidity
better
than
average
dubbel
but
starts
to
get
a
bit
dry
the
more
you
drink
b
to
b
going
to
revisit
this
one
in
a
year
or
two
overall
it
seems
pretty
on
par
with
the
description
of
the
style
maybe
could
have
used
some
sour
lemon
thats
always
good
it
drank
well
enough
was
a
great
beer
overall
this
biere
de
garde
does
a
lot
of
things
at
once
i
can
see
this
type
of
flavor
existing
before
coalfired
steam
was
introduced
as
a
drying
and
kilning
agent
for
malts
prior
the
wood
fired
practices
may
have
imparted
these
darker
toastier
and
smokier
flavors
to
nearly
all
beers
perhaps
this
is
the
motivation
for
this
third
installment
of
their
jazz
series
even
with
that
this
beer
remains
lacking
in
authentic
farmhouse
character
and
results
in
a
simpler
taste
and
keeps
the
beer
somewhat
banal
oa
decent
brew
but
a
bit
off
in
its
combination
of
flavor
and
mouthfeel
pours
a
mostlyclear
brownamber
color
with
a
short
white
head
some
spotty
lacing
as
it
goes
down
the
nose
is
pretty
tame
bringing
just
a
bit
of
malt
and
bread
crust
the
flavor
is
more
complex
and
fits
the
style
quite
well
bringing
some
nice
earthy
elements
and
a
slight
fruity
touch
bread
is
the
main
characteristic
some
sweetness
medium
body
and
moderate
carbonation
a
good
example
of
a
style
im
not
particularly
fond
of
a
decent
beer
from
bells
but
i
can
see
why
this
is
not
a
regular
for
them
overall
the
smell
and
taste
of
the
beer
are
good
but
i
was
unimpressed
with
the
beer
overall
if
still
available
the
next
time
im
at
bells
ill
revisit
this
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
crisp
with
perhaps
just
a
bit
too
much
carbonation
the
body
is
significant
enough
to
handle
it
though
and
any
less
carbonation
would
probably
make
the
medium
body
seem
a
bit
on
the
heavy
side
the
beer
finishes
with
some
lingering
sweetness
but
it
doesnt
come
close
to
the
toothsome
tastes
of
the
pianiste
i
liked
this
beer
more
than
the
other
two
in
the
series
as
i
felt
the
malt
bill
was
more
in
line
with
the
better
examples
of
bière
de
garde
ive
been
fortunate
enough
to
try
this
is
worth
seeking
out
but
maybe
im
partial
as
ive
always
been
enamored
with
its
namesake
i
just
wanted
to
play
an
instrument
i
could
carry
home
on
the
bus
without
having
to
sit
up
front
next
to
the
tuba
kid
overall
it
is
somewhat
drinkable
but
there
just
isnt
a
lot
of
flavor
in
it
not
something
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
try
again
draft
at
autumn

pours
a
clear
reddish
mahagony
color
with
a
slight
white
head
very
malty
and
biscuity
in
the

the
taste
is
as
i
smelled
sweet
up

with
a
long
drawn
out
biscuity
and
sweet
taste
minimal
hop
presence
a
big
and
rich
beer
medium

didnt
pick
up
any

not
too
bad
drinkability
the
strongest
in
alcohol
and
flavor
of
the
three
biere
de
gardes
but
the
slightly
cloying
body
means
that
i
prefer
le

still
quite
good

the

almost
like

medium

highly
carbonated
cloying
at
times
not
the
best
offering
from
these

but
unique
for
its
style
mediumbidied
with
a
prominent
roasty
smoked
flavor
up
front
with
hints
of
acrid
burnt
malt
and
toast
which
are
quickly
mellowed
out
by
sweet
notes
of
hazelnut
toffee
milk
chocolate
and
caramel
a
bit
too
carbonated
for
my
loony
but
this
beer
improves
with
warmth
becoming
more
smooth
and
balanced
with
a
slightly
creamy
lactic
presence
probably
the
most
complex
biere
de
garde
ive
had
quite
a
beer
delicious
2012

both
as
to
be

the

was
coupled
to
the
rest
of
the
flavors
in
such
a
way
that
is
to
be
truly
commemorated
complementary
mouthfeel
aged
for

years
i
was

something
stellar
i
was
rewarded
with
an

with

enjoy
it
for
what
it
is
and
what
you
expect
it
to
be
and
you
wont
be
disappointed
mouthfeel
dissipating
and
refreshing
overall
4

this
is
my
first
biere
de
garde
so
im
not
able
to
say
if
it
holds
true
to
style
that
said
it
is
a
nicely
complex
sour
my
only
complaint
would
be
the
oak
is
it
a
bit
too
forward
and
overpowers
the
other
flavors
probably
would
be
a
good
beer
to
age
a
bit
longer
to
see
if
the
oak
fades
and
allows
the
other
flavors
to
shine
through
although
not
the
same
style
i
much
prefer
the
rodenbach
2008
vintage
for
roughly
the
same
cost
i
taste
also
as
draught
beer
a
great
biére
one
of
the
best
sours
ive
had
sourness
and
wine
define
a
sharp
dryness
in
which
warming
spices
a
lot
of
oak
and
slick
acidity
create
a
pleasant
complexity
fruitiness
developes
berry
and
lemony
hints
as
the
sourness
becomes
even
more
recognizable
towards
the
end
although
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
carbonation
is
too
high
for
the
complex
character
of
the
beer
metallic
notes
disturb
the
fragile
balance
as
it
rolls
over
the
palate
giving
the
beer
more
time
to
age
might
help
as
it
has
great
potential
brown
color
some
caramel
sweetness
to
subdue
the
tart
sour
loving
the
slight
oak
flavor
o
spent
30
on
a
750ml
and
impressed
taken
back
on
how
well
rounded
everything
was
here
sweet
but
not
overbearing
same
with
the
sour
component
actually
more
refinded
than
many
cantillon
krieks
ive
had
will
get
again
this
is
one
of
my
all
time
favorites
i
recommend
letting
it
warm
to
at
least
5055
degrees
before
trying
because
cold
refrigeration
mutes
the
flavors
severely
very
good
but
not
quite
a
standout
pricey
for
what
it
is
one
of
the
greatest
biere
de
garde
styles
i
have
ever
had
the
pleasure
of
drinking
holy
mother
of
delicious
very
well
balanced
with
a
lot
of
flavor
i
cant
wait
to
try
the
other
vintages
o
fantastic
sour
complex
flavors
that
are
balanced
very
well
will
buy
again
if
i
am
lucky
enough
to
find
it
o
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
strong
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
solid
beer
to
drink
for
a
while
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
the
style
o
a
complex
and
intriguing
beer
so
glad
i
tried
it
this
is
a
beer
thats
been
around
for
a
long
while
and
its
easy
to
see
why
great
balance
and
complexity
and
just
an
all
around
solid
offering
definitely
worth
seeking
out
and
its
one
of
those
rare
nongueuze
beers
that
ages
wonderfully
pours
out
a
deep
reddish
caramel
body
with
a
thin
frothed
milk
head
smell
is
of
wood
toasted
malts
berries
funk
acid
brown
sugar
this
first
flavor
impression
is
acidity
along
with
light
caramel
sweetness
chocolate
toasted
bread
warm
wood
gentle
earthy
hop
faintly
alcohol
is
very
wellhidden
but
perceptible
finishes
rather
dry
amazing
mouthfeel
is
moderate
in
weight
with
a
sharp
bubbliness
acidity
strips
the
tongue
incredible
beer
not
what
i
was
expecting
nice
oakey
and
sour
aromas
very
deceptive
sour
that
may
be
the
best
balanced
sour
ive
had
sour
clears
the
way
for
a
nice
oakey
finish
a
very
nice
beer
that
really
excited
me
even
more
on
the
reemergence
of
sours
in
the
us
very
enjoyable
more
swiss
craft
please
ooverall
great
sour
my
first
from
bfm
must
try
more
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
snifter
the
beer
is
00276
brewed
in
2007
and
blended
in
dec
2008
the
beer
is
a
murky
amberbrown
coloring
with
a
peppering
of
small
carbonation
bubbles
throughout
and
no
head
aromatic
as
soon
as
you
pry
the
cap
off
wow
aromas
of
tart
cherry
tannins
old
world
fruit
sweetness
in
the
backbone
apples
roasted
notes
and
an
abundance
of
spices
including
cloves
coriander
and
nutmeg
very
layered
nose
and
more
and
more
comes
out
as
you
drink
great
flavors
are
fruit
rich
forward
with
a
blast
of
berries
and
cherries
enveloped
in
tart
and
slightly
acidic
notes
keeping
a
perfect
balance
across
the
palate
darkly
sweet
plum
and
fig
backbone
with
a
spiced
blend
that
warms
a
bit
as
well
as
provides
some
edge
to
all
the
smooth
and
rich
notes
the
tart
turns
slightly
sour
towards
the
tail
end
of
the
palate
which
does
a
solid
job
of
cleaning
up
all
of
the
majorly
rich
and
heavy
characteristics
smooth
midbodied
in
mouth
with
a
tart
and
fruity
aftertaste
that
has
a
slightly
astringent
feel
to
it
the
finish
is
crisp
with
a
slightly
sour
linger
very
delicious
beer
worth
seeking
out
im
gonna
keep
this
one
short
even
though
this
beer
deserves
a
little
more
detail
pours
a
murky
brown
color
with
no
head
looks
and
smells
like
apple
cider
and
jammy
fruits
with
a
bright
acidity
the
taste
follows
suit
sweet
fruits
up
front
mostly
apple
with
a
hint
of
grape
or
berry
with
a
bright
acidity
the
acidity
is
moderate
and
pleasant
with
a
hint
of
acetic
acidvinegar
a
musty
earthiness
follows
with
a
touch
of
oak
and
acetic
acid
and
just
a
hint
of
booze
at
the
end
of
a
long
finish
the
taste
is
sweet
up
front
and
finishes
tart
the
mouth
is
dried
by
some
oak
tannins
carbonation
is
light
enhancing
the
drinkability
this
is
a
very
interesting
beer
that
hides
its
alcohol
content
very
well
expensive
but
highly
recommended
especially
if
you
enjoy
cidery
flavors
o
this
is
astonishingly
drinkable
at
11
both
in
terms
of
flavour
and
in
comparison
to
drinking
a
bottle
of
wine
drinking
a
bottle
of
wine
in
under
half
an
hour
would
leave
me
feeling
pretty
ill
but
this
is
a
delight
sits
easily
on
the
stomach
and
the
palate
this
is
the
most
expensive
beer
ive
ever
bought
at
27
99
before
tax
id
been
thinking
about
buying
this
beer
for
nigh
on
5
months
and
im
glad
i
finally
took
the
plunge
i
was
expecting
to
feel
cheated
but
ill
be
buying
this
again
when
one
considers
how
much
people
are
willing
to
pay
for
a
decent
bottle
of
wine
this
beer
seems
more
reasonably
priced
i
loved
it
and
enjoyed
it
more
than
any
wine
ive
ever
had
when
i
compare
it
in
this
way
i
dont
feel
so
bad
about
the
price
i
look
forward
to
pairing
this
with
some
hearty
frenchswiss
alpine
fare
or
a
berry
crumble
must
try
o
reminds
me
of
a
radenboch
grand
cru
surprisingly
smooth
for
a
11
bier
on
tap
at
maxs
taphouse
foggy
glowing

color
looking
pretty
flat
with
no
head
to
speak
of
sour

and
spicy
wood
aromas
dusty
grapes
cherry
tartness
oak
and
mild
port
a
little
much
on
the
sharp

perhaps
sweetish
upfront
quickly
turning
tart
with
a
dry
wooden
spiciness
slight
acetic
notes
vinegar
cherry
and
no
booze
at
all
slick
dry
and
tart
in
the
mouth
a
good
flemish
souresque
beer
not
sure
id
ever
spend
30
on
a
bottle
though
color
is
slightly
hazy
auburn
red
with
a
rather
quickly
dissipating
head
aroma
is
sweetly
stinky
fermented
grape
musk
tangy
cherry
sweet
earthy
wood
warm
sunny
wild
flowers
taste
is
clean
tart
with
cherry
and
woody
mouth
watering
and
elegant
not
the
slightest
sign
of
alcohol
is
apparent
very
crisp
clean
smoothly
balanced
flavors
mouthfeel
is
slick
and
softly
syrupy
and
this
beer
is
highly
drinkable
pretty
excellent
this
beer
is
a
must
have
if
you
like
sour
beers
had
this
on
tap
at
moeder
lambic
in
brussels
murky
brown
pour
with
a
one
finger
offwhite
head
with
great
retention
and
lacing
nice
woody
subtly
sour
almost
vinous
nose
with
hints
of
balsamic
vinegar
oak
and
dark
fruits
the
taste
follows
suit
with
even
more
of
an
earthy
vinous
character
with
hints
of
sour
cherries
leather
balsamic
vinegar
brown
bread
grape
skins
and
vanilla
the
mouth
feel
is
medium
bodied
with
perfect
carbonation
a
tart
finish
and
huge
drinkability
for
the
style
overall
this
was
the
surprise
highlight
of
a
night
filled
with
great
beers
highly
recommended
o
very
nice
and
very
complex
as
complex
as
this
is
it
is
very
balanced
and
very
enjoyable
cant
wait
to
try
other
vintages
to
compare
to
this
one
o
the
2007
seemed
more
refined
as
a
balanced
drink
with
no
overpowering
notes
the
2010
was
a
little
more
exciting
in
the
sense
that
it
was
bolder
to
a
degree
but
lacked
the
complexity
me
and
my
girlfriend
both
enjoyed
the
older
vintage
as
for
food
something
very
tasty
and
wellcrafted
will
work
i
can
see
everything
from
a
shepherds
pie
to
pate
to
coq
au
vin
pairing
well
with
this
i
dont
think
a
nice
berry
cobbler
is
out
of
the
question
either
a
slight
stretch
could
be
venison
stew
but
really
i
think
the
key
is
something
that
is
fullflavored
and
can
stand
up
to
some
acidity
and
sour
notes
poured
a
brown
hue
with
slightly
reddish
tints
with
minimal
head
and
lace
aroma
is
mostly
tart
cherries
touch
of
oak
and
booze
a
little
sweetness
and
dark
fruit
as
well
fuller
body
almost
sticky
sweet
at
times
real
smooth
thanks
to
oak
and
the
booze
is
mostly
hidden
with
minor
heat
flashes
on
backend
a
little
bit
of
mild
caramel
or
sugary
sweetness
possibly
sweet
fruit
tastes
but
taste
is
mostly
tart
cherries
and
dark
fruit
with
a
sour
edge
everything
is
balanced
and
wellchecked
though
so
this
beer
is
never
overly
sweet
or
tartsour
at
times
and
is
an
enjoyable
sipper
throughout
the
abv
starts
to
hit
as
you
get
near
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
a
good
treat
to
have
here
and
there
this
2011
brew
was
served
in
a
5
oz
glass
so
not
much
head
color
is
brownish
dark
ruby
nose
is
a
bit
sweet
yeasty
immediately
complex
on
the
first
sip
a
blend
if
flavors
fight
to
come
forward
very
enjoyable
mouth
feel
some
fruity
sweetness
but
the
tartness
is
not
hidden
either
definitely
worth
having
another
i
had
the
2011
vintage
on
tap
a
long
time
ago
and
was
curious
to
see
what
age
could
do
to
it
6
years
later
a
lot
is
most
definitely
going
on
unbelievably
complex
this
drinks
like
a
fine
pinot
noir
from
burgundy
but
it
towers
above
most
peers
of
its
kind
including
most
flanders
reds
which
this
is
in
the
same
league
as
if
not
more
complex
excellent
stuff
if
you
can
get
your
hands
on
this
vintage
otherwise
im
sure
most
would
work
one
of
the
best
candidates
for
cellaring

the

this
is
one
beauty
that
made
me
buy
a
saison

on
my
last
shopping
trip
if
only
because
the
style
when
done
well
is
inimitable
powerful
delectable
alcoholic
but
sensible
in
its
balance
bought
on
a
whim
this
exceeded
my
expectations
overall
quite
good
but
not
the
world
class
beer
i
was
hoping
for
a
bit
extreme
like
the
nose
the
taste
has
a
kind
of
overripe
grape
flavor
with
a
sour
and
sharp
bite
at
the
finish
sour
ales
are
not
top
on
my
priority
list
but
for
fans
of
the
style
it
is
probably
quite
delightful
what
a
unique
treat
overall
exceptional
would
never
turn
this
down
ugh
im
finding
this
one
difficult
to
dissect
because
i
always
drink
the
damn
glass
too
fast
andor
drift
off
into
dreamland
while
savoring
wont
be
the
last

visiting
this
im
sure
color
is
a
dark
orange
like
welloiled

smells
of
bleu
cheese
and
oak
shavings
very
delicate
on
the
palate
with
no

and
only
mildly
sour
lots
of
funk
tastes
of

cherries

bitterness
little
mouthfeel
and
no

very

other
things
im
unable
to
put
my
finger
on
o
excellent
drinkability
perfect
beer
close
to
a
flanders
red
ale
i
would
dare
even
better
than
the
2010
version
o
both
the
complexity
and
the
strength
of
the
smelltaste
of
this
beer
really
intensify
as
the
beers
warms
up
quite
enjoyable
and
a
nice
palate
cleanser
in
the
middle
of
a
good
bottle
share
o
this
is
pretty
nice
pleasant
barrel
character
with
a
good
balance
between
the
maltiness
and
acidity
i
have
a
feeling
a
fresh
bottle
would
be
even
better
but
this
has
not
aged
badly
at
all
this
was
a
really
nice
beer
i
havent
had
many
in
this
style
but
i
found
this
beer
to
be
very
complex
and
yet
approachable
i
was
impressed
with
its
depth
and
character
this
was
a
nice
beer
sit
around
and
sip
on
amongst
friends
this
is
probably
a
beer
everyone
should
try
this
sultry
ale
is
a
culinary
delight
on
all
fronts
its
savory
sweet
sour
and
salty
highly
satisfying
to
taste
the
beer
is
mature
surly
and
unpredictable
all
at
once
i
simply
cannot
get
enough
of
it
overall
complexity
is
the
best
aspect
of
this
always
a
fascinating
beer
from
bfm
overall
an
interesting
but
pretty
heavy
beer
not
one
i
would
enjoy
very
often
but
im
glad
i
got
to
try
it
pours
cherry
red
with
hints
of
etches
and
a
very
clarified
smell
is
initially
inky
some
acetone
some
oak
some
cocoa
oddly
very
rich
flavor
cherries
raisins
malt
a
little
malt
and
some
sweetness
very
warm
very
robust
there
is
a
hint
of
sherry
thin
with
sharp
spicy
carb
and
a
little
bit
of
off
dry
character
its
alright
i
wouldnt
buy
a
second
bottle
but
im
told
later
vintages
are
better
decent
cleanser
could
be
better
interesting
drop
but
its
also
good
and
points
for
handling
a
difficult
brief
in
hindsight
my
original
ratings
for
the
2011
were
probably
too
generous
but
they
represented
my
feelings
on
the
beer
at
the
time
so
ill
leave
them
o
wowee
thisll
put
hair
on
your
chest
not
high
on
the
drinkability
scale
but
its
good
for
when
you
want
a
slow
sipper
to
contemplate
with
or
enjoy
while
having
a
oneonone
intimate
conversation
with
a
friend
o
the
price
tag
was
a
little
steep
i
think
it
was
27
but
this
is
a
world
class
beer
that
i
would
suggest
giving
a
go
if
you
are
looking
for
something
unique
and
complex
o
very
complex
oakaged
ale
lots
to
taste
would
avoid
pairing
with
food
given
the
complexity
and
standalone
qualities
o
510
sourness
more
bitter
vinous
notes
than
tart
or
sour
notes
not
sure
ifi
would
spend
the
money
for
another
bottle
it
is
just
superb
bitter
and
sweet
mellow
this
is
fantastic
overall
if
you
love
sour
beers
you
will
love
this
if
you
dont
you
will
likely
still
appreciate
it
sours
are
an
acquired
taste
and
this
one
is
well
done
not
my
favorite
stylew
but
wow
4
15
overall
an
amazing
beer
i
am
very
glad
i
could
try
one
of
the
most
complex
things
i
have
ever
tasted
sweet
like
a
great
oak
aged
beer
yet
still
very
sour
and
tart
2011
vintage
ive
been
eying
this
beer
at
least
mentally
for
years
so
im
pouncing
on
it
here
at
lo
while
i
can
it
pours
a
hazy
copperamber
topped
by
a
halffinger
of
glowing
lightly
offcreamwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
red
wine
vinegar
buttery
toffee
light
walnut
almond
and
spicy
greens
theres
a
lot
going
on
here
in
the
aroma
including
a
few
things
i
cant
quite
put
into
words
properly
suffice
it
to
say
its
sour
lightly
buttery
lightly
nutty
and
lightly
spicy
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
the
same
sort
of
complexity
with
the
vinegar
coming
through
as
more
of
a
citricish
sourness
the
body
is
a
lightleaning
medium
with
a
very
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
sortakinda
lightly
gooey
feel
overall
a
very
nice
highly
complex
beer
one
thats
a
struggle
to
wrap
my
brain
around
and
im
all
the
happier
for
it
a
rare
gem
once
again
procured
from
the
lions
pride
in
brunswick
maine
this
vintage
2010
brew
has
a
hazy
brown
color
with
rusty
edges
a
polite
scattering
of
offwhite
bubbles
that
surround
an
inner
island
on
top
leaving
a
respectable
lace
the
aroma
offers
a
beautiful
blend
of
tart
red
wine
and
deep
woodsy
malt
and
intense
yeast
a
beer
you
can
enjoy
just
smelling
wow
the
flavor
follows
with
a
deliberate
lemon
sweet
tart
and
briney
brown
bread
malt
absolutely
to
be
savored
suggestions
of
a
nice
chianti
tempered
by
the
deep
earthy
malt
and
lemony
sweetness
this
is
so
divinely
balanced
sweet
tart
seaweed
mellow
sharp
and
goes
down
so
easy
but
you
dont
want
to
rush
these
flavors
theres
an
underlying
vanilla
that
pushes
the
malt
and
other
complexities
tease
the
senses
body
is
mediumplus
with
a
somewhat
heavy
feel
with
low
carbonation
but
just
right
for
this
brew
im
highly
pleased
and
would
say
this
was
one
of
the
best
flavorfests
ive
enjoyed
for
many
months
dont
pass
on
this
if
you
are
a
fan
of
the
sourflanders
side
of
beer
love
had
on
tap
at
maxs
in
baltimore
saw
it
advertised
on
the
beer
list
as
a
swiss
sourwild
ale
never
heard
of
that
style
so
felt
i
just
had
to
try
it
i
was
not
disappointed
in
the
least
bit
this
was
one
the
best
tasting
beers
i
may
have
had
in
my
life
high
alcohol
but
completely
hidden
superb
balance
and
mouthfeel
fantastic
sour
and
cherry
flavors
goes
down
way
too
smooth
was
a
struggle
to
just
drink
it
slowly
this
one
packed
a
flavor
punch
and
was
dangerously
good
picked
up
a
coule

bottles
the
first
bottle
caught
me
by
suprise
with
the
big
alcohol
percentage
so
i
wasnt
quite
prepared
the
second
bottle
a
few
months
later
however
was
tasting
delicious
pours
a
slightly
cleark
murky
amber
brownish
colour
the
last
pour
was
hazy
with
sediment
at
the
bottom
got
about
3
glasses
from
each
bottle
tastes
tart
with
cherries
and
oak
coming
through
with
a
nice
sour
mouthfeel
i
love
licking
my
lips
after
each
drink
of
this
this
beer
aged
incredibly
well
cant
believe
i
am
drinking
almost
6
year
old
beer
good
stuff
a
bit
pricey
though
flavor
profile
reminds
me
more
of
a
flanders
red
or
a
bruin
rather
than
a
beer
de
guard
750
ml
bottle
2009
vintage
served
in
a
unibroue
tulip
the
beer
pours
a
reddishbrown
color
with
a
very
thin
light
tan
head
that
fizzed
away
immediately
theres
a
small
amount
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
nice
and
tart
it
smells
like
vinegar
red
wine
oak
tart
cherries
and
some
plums
taste
is
pretty
much
the
same
as
the
aroma
but
with
the
addition
of
some
lemon
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
with
lowmoderate
carbonation
i
think
this
is
a
good
overall
brew
but
i
wouldnt
buy
it
again
anytime
soon
because
its
pricey
22
99
a
bottle
with
that
being
said
its
worth
trying
if
youve
never
had
it
before
not
my
favorite
style
but
this
one
was
very
nice
still
not
sure
it
was
worth
the
money
but
a
very
nice
treat
o
not
quite
as
good
as
i
remember
it
on
tap
but
still
pretty
exceptional
highly
recommended
to
anyone
who
enjoys
sour
ales
of
any
stripe
i
might
should
have
let
this
one
age
a
while
but
temptation
got
the
best
of
me
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
but
it
did
not
wow
me
in
any
way
shape
or
form
the
flavors
seemed
mellowed
and
slighly
muddled
together
and
the
aroma
was
less
than
impressive
for
the
cost
i
would
seek
something
else
note
2010
vintage
overall
an
amazing
and
memorable
beer
one
that
certainly
bridges
the
gap
between
fine
beer
and
wine
this
was
a
beauty
in
the
glass
dark
brown
with
some
plum
red
when
struck
towards
the
light
a
nice
half
inch
of
faded
tan
with
no
sticking
on
the
sides
it
dies
leaving
a
small
skim
around
the
glass
and
some
sediment
seen
in
the
glass
smell
is
very
big
and
bold
with
a
wine
characteristic
berries
apple
and
some
underlining
funk
about
the
farthest
thing
from
beer
ive
tasted
not
getting
a
whole
lot
of
the
base
biere
de
garde
but
berries
wine
oak
grape
and
a
hint
of
balsamic
vinegar
make
for
a
great
bouquet
acidity
is
at
about
medium
with
some
tang
on
the
end
about
medium
build
light
carb
within
a
half
hour
pretty
great
stuff
and
something
to
sip
on
for
an
hour
or
so
this
is
truly
one
of
the
better
beers
i
ever
had
its
incredibly
complex
but
refined
in
its
characteristics
its
also
of
an
at
least
moderate
sourness
level
which
makes
it
very
enjoyable
this
is
what
i
expected
from
the
2007
vintage
and
it
did
not
disappoint
great
aspects
similar
to
a
lambic
with
soft
features
typical
of
a
belgian
ale
almost
dubbel
or
strong
dark
like
it
was
an
expensive
purchase
at
27
but
i
would
not
hesitate
to
buy
it
again
the
only
thing
comparable
is
offerings
from
russian
river
overall
a
very
impressive
brew
reminds
me
alot
of
the
regional
sour
browns
of
belgium
can
hold
a
candle
to
alot
of
different
brettwild
yeast
beers
and
has
aged
gracefully
could
hold
up
alot
longer
but
drinking
fine
now
this
guy
delivers
on
all
fronts
smooth
easy
drinking
with
loads
of
tart
fruit
and
balsamic
notes
that
deliver
the
sour
you
crave
overall
an
excellent
beer
but
sadly
the
price
tag
will
edge
me
out
of
ordering
this
more
often
than
id
like
pours
a
murky
orangebrown
with
a
foamy
tan
head
that
fades
to
nothing
no
lacing
on
this
one
smell
is
of
sour
and
tart
fruit
slight
vinegar
funk
and
woody
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
an
acidicdrying
quality
on
the
finish
this
beer
has
a
low
level
of
carbonation
with
an
almost
flat
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
with
a
great
sour
presence
in
the
aroma
and
taste
i
just
wish
the
carbonation
level
was
better
on
this
one
at
27
a
bottle
i
found
this
beer
to
be
hugely
disappointing
bottling
beers
in
green
glass
is
always
risky
i
would
love
to
try
a
more
recent
vintage
to
see
if
the
off
notes
are
less
apparent
overall
excellent
the
2009
seems
to
be
ideal
right
now
ill
save
my
bottle
of
2010
until
this
time
next
year
o
well
its
somewhat
sour
but
its
not
very
good
o
overall
i
liked
this
beer
a
lot
ive
steered
away
from
these
beers
because
of
their
price
tags
but
i
liked
this
one
a
lot
will
certainly
pick
it
up
in
the
future
overall
impression
12
while
enjoying
side
by
side
the
2007
version
was
much
more
sour
and
found
we
both
enjoyed
this
one
more
im
not
sure
what
i
think
about
the
price
of
these
brews
yet
there
are
plenty
of
biere
de
gardes
and
other
belgianfrench
style
beers
you
could
get
for
your
buck
besides
this
one
i
would
recommend
grabbing
a
2007
over
the
2006
in
my
opinion
happy
to
have
finally
enjoyed
this
after
buying
over
a
year
ago
one
would
expect
this
style
to
be
good
with
food
contemplation
or
reading
and
abbaye
de
saint
bonchein
delivers
i
am
reminded
of
wing
chairs
and
leatherbound
books
its
a
confusing
beer
this
one
im
certainly
not
wowed
by
it
nor
particularly
enamoured
of
it
at
all
but
it
has
enough
interest
to
keep
you
hoping
thats
worth
something
at
least
even
if
for
me
my
hopes
ended
up
in
disappointment
the
11
alcohol
is
so
well
hidden
you
could
consume
many
of
these
beers
before
figuring
out
that
it
will
sneak
up
on
you
lemon
notes
with
the
sourness
but
generally
just
so
easy
to
drink
delicious
on
draft
at
dutchs
served
in
a
snifter
looks
decent
although
theres
no
head
or
carbonation
to
speak
of
smells
good
nice
and
tart
tastes
good
too
the
age
has
helped
marry
all
of
the
flavors
together
mouthfeel
is
the
weakest
link
very
pedestrian
this
is
mostly
due
to
the
lack
of
carbonation
overall
a
privilege
to
get
to
try
but
slightly
disappointing
just
because
my
expectations
were
so
high
im
not
a
fan
of
flat
sours
a
pleasant
surprise
that
wasnt
on
my
radar
at
all
i
loved
this
beer
and
will
be
seeking
it
out
again
overwhelming
sour
and
loads
of
complex
fruit
flavors
with
the
perfect
amount
of
oak
to
balance
it
all
out
in
a
night
with
a
ton
of
great
beer
this
one
ranked
right
up
with
them
poured
into
a
duchesse

bourgogne
goblet

sour
vinegar
ripe
apples
cherry
flavor
of
tart
light
fruit
cherries
apples
apricots
sour
and
vinous
flavors
are
well
integrated
and
nicely
supported
by
the
oak
components
and
the
background
neutral
malt
unusually
well
blended
sweet
and
sour
fruit
and
dry
woody
flavors
medium
to
heavy
bodied
with
nice
carbonation
considering
the
thin
head
sour
beers
are
always
a
gamble
for
me
and
this
was
quite
expensive
so
im
glad
that
it
is
so
pleasant
and
well
made
the
best
biere
de
garde
ive
had
2007
bottle
aged
in
my
cellar
for
over
a
year
this
one
ranks
high
on

one
word
synopsis
regal
would
love
to
try
older
vintages
just
a
splendid
beer
that
must
be
enjoyed
slowly
in
order
to
truly
grasp
the
depth
and
quality
found
here
edit
just
poured
the
second
half
of
the
bottle
at
around
64f
and
got
a
massive
offwhite

this
beer
is
not
meant
to
be
consumed
below
60f
cheers
drinkability
and
overall
impression
i
found
this
one
easily
drinkable
despite
the
abv
each
sip
came
quite
easily
and
i
often
found
myself
sipping
more
rapidly
than
i
had
intended
as
i
sought
to
sort
out
the
complexity
of
aroma
and
flavor
id
definitely
have
this
one
again
my
overall
impression
is
of
a
first
rate
beer
which
may
come
up
short
on
appearance
but
more
than
makes
up
for
it
on
aroma
and
flavor
lightly
carbonated
and
thinly
bodied
for
such
a
big
beer
you
would
never
know
that
it
packed
a
punch
insanely
mellow
that
11
abv
never
even
makes
an
appearance
much
less
become
the
focal
point
of
the
beer
a
masterfully
crafted
brew
now
if
we
could
only
do
something
about
that
appearance
o
this
is
not
really
a
beer
it
is
more
of
an
experience
than
anything
else
if
you
ever
have
the
opportunity
to
try
any
vintage
of
this
beer
ontap
do
so
the
beer
is
much
livelier
and
much
more
vibrant
ontap
than
out
of
the
bottle
making
it
easier
for
the
reviewer
to
separate
all
of
the
flavors
in
the
end
this
was
a
great
drinking
experience
and
one
that
every
beer
fan
would
do
well
to
seek
out
perfect
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
had
in
my
life
low
carbonation
for
a
tap
brew
fits
perfectly
the
brew
appears
nearly
still
but
hits
the
mouth
with
a
bright
clarity
of
purpose
why
cant
this
be
served
everywhere
by
the
quart
for
free
clear
brown
pour
with
absolutely
no
head
the
aroma
is
full
of
oak
vinegar
funk
booze
and
lighter
fruits
like
apple
very
much
like
a
wine
the
taste
has
big
hits
of
oak
and
booze
dark
fruits
seem
to
balance
it
out
unlike
the
lighter
fruits
i
got
on
the
smell
lots
of
acidity
and
funk
lend
their
hands
as
the
beer
warms
it
seems
to
be
a
different
type
of
sour
than
the
tradition
lambics
or
american
wild
ale
creamy
body
with
only
a
small
amount
of
carbonation
warming
booze
on
the
back
very
interesting
taste
all
of
the
flavors
play
nicely
to
create
a
delicious
balanced
beer
cheers
a
lot
of
brewers
nowadays
experiment
with
wild
yeasts
and
barrel
aging
and
while
they
may
present
themselves
as
archers
its
often
apparent
that
they
dont
even
own
a
bow
they
could
learn
a
thing
or
two
from
switzerlands
abbaye
de
saint
bonchien
i
have
no
idea
where
these
guys
came
from
but
im
glad
theyre
here
profusely
recommended
overall
awesome
so
tasty
great
tart
sour
fruits
sour
malts
a
bit
bready
not
mouth
puckering
or
over
the
top
very
tasty
and
nice
funk
to
it
at
the
same
time
notes
not
the
first
time
i
have
it
always
on
tap
but
id
love
to
get
hold
of
a
couple
of
bottles
and
i
see
myself
revisiting
it
so
it
is
a
bit
of
an
overdue
review
for
a
brew
that
maybe
is
not
for
regular
consumption
but
definitely
leaves
a
nice
dent
in
the
memory
overall
had
to
drain
pour
it
in
the
end
the
sour
and
vinegar
was
too
strong
doubts
about
the
beer
started
with
the
green
bottle
i
was
worried
by
the
giant
wiff
of
vinegar
i
got
when
i
opened
it
but
that
smell
seems
to
have
dissipated
and
i
am
left
with
a
very
pleasant
smelling
beer
i
will
be
drinking
an
entire
bottle
to
my
head
tonight
looking
forward
to
trying
one
of
the
douzes
i
bought
as
well
awesome
overall
ordinarily
id
be
suspect
of
something
like
this
overall
i
just
couldnt
get
past
that
initial
taste
i
was
bummed
out
by
this
11
abv
could
have
fooled
me
it
feels
like
you
could
drink
this
till
the
cows
come
home
just
one
heck
of
a
tasty
brew
i
just
devoured
this
like
crazy
drank
it
all
night
pours
a
very
murky
brown
with
a
rust
red
tint
has
virtually
no
head
just
a
bubble
or
two
on
the
sides
the
nose
is
tart
and
sour
with
a
very
earthy
funk
behind
it
that
taste
follows
suite
with
the
nose
and
is
full
of
tart
fruits
and
earthy
notes
as
well
as
a
funky
unique
taste
for
the
lack
of
head
i
expected
a
much
flatter
beer
but
in
the
mouth
there
was
some
decent
carbonation
with
a
bit
of
heat
from
the
alcohol
really
liked
this
beer
o
very
nice
surprise
didnt
know
much
so
i
didnt
expect
much
but
it
was
very
legit
this
is
a
pleasant
departure
for
beer
not
your
every
day
beer
sometimes
less
is
more
o
good
beer
very
complex
and
weird
i
like
it
edit
2009
vintage
i
liked
considerably
better
bumped
up
the
taste
interesting
beer
i
felt
the
booze
was
a
bit
more
prominent
than
i
would
like
perhaps
its
because
my
bottle
was
relatively
young
i
think
this
is
one
that
could
be
aged
for
years
i
may
buy
another
and
throw
it
in
the
cellar
for
a
few
years
really
interesting
dynamic
brew
something
about
it
made
me
think
of
consecration
but
this
has
a
lot
more
going
on
with
a
thicker
syrupy
mouthfeel
i
felt
like
it
was
a
bit
unnecessarily
abrasive
however
im
really
interested
to
see
if
that
changes
some
with
age
medium
to
full
bodied
nice
balance
between
tartsweetbitter
very
good

dr

suffers
from

very

especially
considering

the

may
be
offputting
to
some
but
fans
of

will
be
pleased
o
very
good
not

into

i
could
drink
this

great
2007
bottle
this
beer
poured
out
as
an
interesting
looking
reddish
color
the
head
came
and
went
fairly
fast
the
aromas
of
oak
funk
sour
cherries
and
some
winelike
fumes
come
off
of
this
beer
the
taste
of
the
beer
gets
better
as
it
warms
up
i
found
this
beer
to
be
very
tart
and
sour
in
the
beginning
as
it
got
warmer
the
funk
and
oak
flavors
came
out
more
and
took
over
in
place
of
the
sourness
the
mouthfeel
had
a
pretty
good
carbonation
to
it
but
was
a
little
thin
i
thought
overall
its
a
good
sour
for
sure
im
not
a
fan
of
the
style
but
i
feel
it
would
please
most
beer
drinkers
this
was
really
nice
it
does
to
show
you
that
there
are
plenty
of
unknown
obscure
beers
that
you
might
gloss
over
that
turn
out
to
be
real
winners
consumed
at
thirsty
monk
asheville
this
is
a
medium
to
full
bodied
brew
the
fullness
is
a
bit
exaggerated
due
to
the
nature
of
the
low
carbonation
it
is
not
flat
but
just
slightly
bubbly
enough
to
lighten
up
the
feel
a
bit
the
huge
alcohol
presence
provides
solid
warmth
all
the
way
down
the
throat
a
big
depth
of
flavor
and
barrel
aging
effect
mixed
with
medicinal
qualities
there
is
a
pleasant
funkiness
that
dominates
the
sour
aspect
yet
it
is
tangy
like
cherry
overall
an
enjoyable
offering
that
is
worth
checking
out
i
think
the
15
abv
is
a
bit
excessive
toning
that
down
would
greatly
increase
the
drinkability
of
this
brew
even
at
almost
7
years
old
this
brew
could
easily
last
a
few
more
o
this
is
one
of
the
most
unknownunderappreciated
beers
on
the
market
it
lurks
in
the
shadows
of
beer
stores
in
the
know
just
to
get
picked
up
by
people
like
me
if
you
havnt
tried
it
and
have
the
option
pick
it
up
i
think
its
only
20
for
the
bottle
if
you
dont
know
where
to
get
it
ask
your
local
beer
stores
beer
guy
to
order
it
you
wont
be
disappointed
overall
this
is
nice
very
tasty
approachable
and
very
easy
to
drink
like
i
said
earlier
i
find
myself
wanting
a
touch
more
sourness
but
thats
a
nick
pick
this
is
good
stuff
i
would
have
never
guessed
that
this
was
11
abv
overall
a
very
very
good
beer
if
you
like
rodenbach
grand
cru
you
will
like
this
on
my
way
out
of
the
store
my
beer
bud
there
and
resident
expert
asked
if
i
planned
on
aging
the
bottle
at
the
time
i
didnt
think
there
was
any
chance
id
drop
another
almost30
to
age
one
but
im
starting
to
reconsider
pick
this
one
up
when
you
run
into
it
d
a
fantastic
beer
from
the
swissthe
delicate
balance
of
tartsour
warm
alcohol
malt
sweetness
and
wood
was
right
on
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
beer
and
i
would
certainly
drink
it
again
well
if
i
can
afford
to
30
00
a
bottle
is
a
bit
steep
cheers
lots
of
different
variations
on
this
one
so
hope
im
reviewing
under
the
correct
category
2009
vintage
blend
of
merlot
pinot
noir
pinot
gris
and
cabernet
barrels
the
menu
says
anyways
murky
brown
with
some
ruby
highlights
to
it
and
a
very
tan
head
that
fades
quickly
yet
leaves
a
collar
that
stays
nose
is
oak
vanilla
must
musk
currant
sourdark
cherry
prune
plum
acid
alcohol
and
a
funky
kind
of
wild
bretty
cherry
pie
character
woah
big
boozy
and
complex
as
they
come
but
warm
and
inviting
at
the
same
time
taste
is
luscious
and
beautiful
and
exudes
fantastic
balance
of
all
the
flavors
noted
above
bretty
cherry
pie
and
oak
stand
out
the
most
to
me
and
alcohol
flavor
doesnt
detract
a
bit
it
amplifies
the
other
flavors
just
like
it
should
and
even
comes
in
to
play
as
a
flavor
of
its
own
mediumfull
body
is
slick
and
silky
leaving
a
surprisingly
clean
finish
that
sends
flavors
of
oaky
currant
booze
out
my
nose
and
makes
me
pucker
just
a
tiny
bit
a
wonderful
sensory
experience
these
asbc
beers
are
and
a
real
treat
to
try
on
tap
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
sour
beers
so
i
havent
had
too
many
but
this
one
was
extremely
good
not
puckeringly
sour
a
good
balance
of
funk
and
sour
nice
beer
from
bfm
but
im
not
sure
if
this
can
be
labeled
as
biere
de
garde
though
it
has
lots
of
yeast
complexity
and
i
definitely
recommend
it
overall
i
think
this
is
one
of
the
few
beers
that
benefitted
from
bottle
conditioning
as
the
bottle
was
superb
and
the
tap
decidedly
less
so
still
a
very
good
beer
that
does
a
very
good
job
of
hiding
the
alcohol
and
melding
a
variety
of
flavors
well
worth
a
shot
any
way
you
can
find
it
retro
review
from
1109
d
this
is
as
drinkable
as
it
gets
for
an
11
brew
goes
down
incredibly
easily
and
invites
you
back
for
more
with
the
its
drawout
aftertaste
would
be
even
better
with
more

d
one
of
the
most
interesting
beers
ive
had
to
date
superior
drinkability
for
the
abv
just
a
phenomenal
allaround
beer
here
nothing
like
it
absolutely
cannot
believe
this
is
11
abv
completely
drinkable
and
amzingly
flavored
when
i
review
the
current
version
the
score
will
be
somewhere
bewteen
an
a
and
an
a
as
this
beer
is
awesome
the
2008
batch
was
much
more
sour
and
somewhat
metallic
not
quite
as
good
an
amazing
beer
bfm
always
makes
something
exceptional
add
one
more
to
their
list
of
awesomeness
an
experience
and
a
treat
pick
some
up
if
you
ever
see
it
drinkability
probably
the
best
sour
beer
i
have
had
of
course
after
three
years
of
burgundy
barrel
aging
i
am
not
sure
this
is
really
a
biere
de
garde
but
who
cares
its
great
pours
a
slightlybrowned
garnet
color
with
a
thin
off
white
head
and
a
tiny
bit
of
lacing
nose
brings
some
lactic
sourness
cherries
hints
of
dark
fruits
and
a
bit
of
earth
taste
and
feel
add
in
a
nice
oak
presence
and
the
sourness
becomes
a
bit
more
prevalent
the
cherries
and
light
malt
fit
well
together
bringing
a
nice
bready
character
out
drinks
quite
well
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
brown
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
tart
apples
oak
vanilla
and
toffee
very
nice
smelling
the
flavor
is
sour
apples
oak
caramel
and
vanilla
the
beer
is
very
dry
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
a
very
good
sour
beer
drinkability
like
that
time
i
drove
out
to
myrtle
beach
it
makes
for
a
reasonably
decent
onetime
visit
however
with
the
alcohol
palatewearying
phenols
and
hefty
pricetag
i
just
dont
see
myself
returning
to
it
d
overall
a
tasty
beer
even
with
the
lack
of
carbonation
i
am
not
sure
if
i
just
happened
upon
a
flat
bottle
or
if
all
of
this
vintage
are
like
this
drinkability
delicious
very
easy
drinking
but
strong
d
i
have
enjoyed
all
the
bottles
of
this
that
ive
tried
but
for
the
price
i
have
a
hard
time
buying
them
still
a
good
beer
however
vintage
2007
tasted
from
750ml
bottle
at
lush
west
town
pours
a
chunky
cloudy
amber
with
a
lacy
light
brown
head
nose
of
sour
cherries
and
some
funky
earthiness
flavor
is
sour
and
fruity
with
red
berries
and
a
lot
of
funk
body
is
medium
with
light
carbonation
and
a
long
funky
sour
finish
a
2006
bottle
the
color
burgundy
could
be
confused
for
a
glass
of
wine
if
it
wasnt
for
all
of
the
haze
with
active
bubbly
offwhite
head
smell
is
of
a
high
quality
red
wine
american
oak
backed
by
some
tart
sour
and
funky
notes
wonderful
the
scent
is
done
right
by
the
taste
a
pronounced
but
delicate
acidic
and
tart
wine
charachter
backed
by
the
touches
of
hay
oak
earth
grain
and
funk
amazing
taste
medium
bodied
dry
better
as
the
carbonation
settles
a
very
wonderful
beer
easliy
comparably
to
rr
consecration
a
bit
more
mild
without
the
added
currants
would
love
to
experience
other
years
to
a
cabernet
mouthfeel
is
full
and
sticky
prickly
and
tart
on
the
back
of
the
throat
cherry
sweetness
and
oaky
vanilla
flavors
are
first
and
foremost
followed
by
light
grainy
malts
and
green
grape
sweetness
the
finish
is
a
fantastic
mess
of
boozy
funky
sour
flavors
totally
worth
the
high

4162010
750ml
bottle
brought
back
from
switzerland
by
my
cousin
who
then
sent
it
on
to
me
yes
i
poured
this
into
three
wine
tumblers
and
it
was
a
cloudy
reddishorange
color
with
a
wispy
head
it
smelled
tart
and
inviting
the
taste
was
quite
weird
tart
some
citrus
just
very
complex
and
i
could
not
accurately
describe
the
flavor
other
than
to
say
i
liked
it
a
lot
i
probably
would
not
finish
the
whole
bottle
so
i
am
real
glad
i
shared
it
this
beer
was
quite
intriguing
d
drinkability
is
very
good
i
would
never
guess
this
beer
to
be
at
11
even
though
the
alcohol
is
masked
well
this
one
is
still
a
sipper
the
abundant
flavors
guarantee
that
it
starts
out
pretty
tart
but
as
it
warms
the
tartness
really
starts
to
mellow
the
oak
really
comes
through
as
well
i
must
say
im
quite
impressed
with
my
first
brew
from
bfm
very
highly
recommended
abbaye
de
saint
bonchien
is
an
impressive
biere
de
garde
every
time
i
try
this
style
i
have
to
reacquaint
myself
with
it
this
particular
release
is
very
impressive
and
has
few
weak
points
i
dont
know
what
a
fresh
bottle
tastes
like
but
this
2007
blend
is
quite
good
i
think
i
might
like
a
few
more
bubbles
but
thats
about
it
it
has
a
ton
of
flavor
and
just
enough
tartness
to
really
make
it
work
the
oak
really
drives
it
up
a
notch
all
around
very
good
stuff
highly
recommended
if
you
find
a
bottle
great
ruby
red
garnet
color
with
clarity
light
tan
head
appears
with
tight
bubbles
and
little
to
no
lacing
such
a
pretty
beer
in
the
glass
aroma
is
vanilla
sour
cherry
oak
and
licorice
flavor
has
a
great
malty
quality
that
gives
way
to
abundent
fruit
and
oak
flavors
ending
with
some
tartness
and
faint
sourness
every
flavor
and
aroma
in
this
beer
is
balanced
just
right
amazing
this
beer
slides
over
your
tongue
with
such
ease
silky
with
just
the
right
amount
of
carb
11
if
i
didnt
know
wouldnt
have
been
the
wiser
i
could
easily
plow
through
a
bunch
of
this
stuff
tart
sour
gets
me
in
the
back
of
the
mouth
almost
a
woodsey
musk
to
the
whole
thing
some
sweet
sour
in
the
front
no
bitterness
to
speak
of
beer
is
a
little
thin
second
taste
slight
alcohol
and
a
growing
bitterness
that
time
mouthfeel
is
good
and
drinkability
is
good
as
well
i
would
recommend
this
beer
drinkability
was
only
fair
halfway
through
the
25
ounce
bottle
and
already
im
ambivalent
about
whether
i
finish
it
quite
frankly
the
price
did
not
make
me
want
anymore
either
at
five
bucks
im
not
impressed
at
25
bucks
even
less
so
cant
wait
to
run
this
one
by
a
couple
of
my
wino
friends
to
see
what
they
think
drinkability
suffered
a
touch
just
because
this
was
strong
and
had
a
lot
going
on
but
it
was
a
pleasant
beer
and
i
enjoyed
the
myriad
of
unique
flavors
a
winner
now
i
want
to
try
some
of
the
varieties
d
goes
down
nicely
you
notice
the
11
abv
but
you
dont
care
assuming
you
dig
the
style
really
good
this
beer
is
definitely
worth
the
23
not
something
to
get
too
often
but
worth
it
once
in
a
while
if
i
see
it
again
that
is
overall
i
was
really
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
it
was
a
well
balanced
not
over
the
top
sour
beer
very
easy
drinking
fairly
drinkable
because
it
didnt
have
a
lot
of
acidic
flavors
d
man
this
one
could
you
a
few
years
after
drinking
one
of
the
grand
crus
also
vintage
date
2008
i
figured
this
would
be
safe
to
open
as
well
i
imagine
a
year
or
two
extra
in
the
bottle
could
help
round
out
the
edges
on
this
beer
help
it
reach
its
full
potential
as
for
now
this
beer
is
still
tastes
like
a
fully
fleshed
out
example
of
any
other
brewers
biere
de
garde
and
i
look
forward
to
revisiting
this
one
in
a
year
or
two
2007
version
very
similar
in
the
flavor
profile
but
the
exact
opposite
in
carbonation
as
it
is
almost
noncarbonated
for
a
beer
of
this
style
however
the
lack
of
carbonation
works
very
well
i
may
even
prefer
it
drawback
the
cost
of
entry
was
pretty
high
here
based
on
how
uncommon
it
probably
is
im
guessing
most
people
will
pay
30
a
bottle
or
so
i
paid
35
i
just
take
for
granted
that
i
can
buy
these
around
here
but
this
is
the
first
time
ive
tasted
one
all
i
can
say
is
i
will
definitely
be
buying
more
of
these
as
this
is
an
excellent
beer
very
complex
and
drinkable
highly
recommended
this
was
really
drinkable
which
was
dangerous
before
i
had
left
jacks
my
2
friends
and
i
had
polished
off
2
of
these
and
enjoyed
every
sip
overall
a
fantastic
beer
and
a
great
surprise
an
intriguing
beer
well
worth
drinking

this
is
an
interesting
beer
with
sour
and
sweet
elements
cherry
is
the
main
flavor
and
aromait
has
both
of
the
main
flavor
elements
its
a
medium
bodied
beer
but
has
a
carbonation
that
makes
it
feel
richer
d
this
is
outstanding
stuff
well
worth
the
wait
and
search
to
try
it
drinks
more
like
a
5
brew
tons
of
interesting
flavour
this
would
be
a
great
winter
warmer
to
split
with
a
couple
of
friends
thanks
nightbrew
for
pulling
this
from
your
secretive
cellar
notes
this
beer
shows
outstanding
complexity
balance
and
sophistication
i
could
sip
this
all
night
paired
up
with
a
nice
plate
of
fine
cheese
and
fruit
d
a
good
beer
quite
interesting
it
has
an
edgy
character
due
to
the
way
the
tartness
mixes
with
the
aromas
and
the
gentle
sweetness
would
definitely
have
another
if
you
have
any
of
the
05
vintage
left
i
would
recommend
drinking
them
very
soon
i
believe
they
have
gone
downhill
a
lot
already
and
just
keep
on
rolling
this
is
a
crazy
unique
and
interesting
beer
though
so
its
worth
trying
flavorful
and
really
good
not
overwhelming
at
all
but
i
can
think
of
cheaper
lambics
or
flanders
red
which
is
more
similar
in
style
that
id
go
for
if
i
had
to
pay
haha
planning
to
rerate
the
cellared
05
276
to
add
to
this
bare
review
an
extremely
wellcrafted
and
inspiring
brew
more
stuff
like
this
please
d
dont
know
if
i
would
drink
this
again
not
my
style
it
was
strong
as
well
so
cant
say
it
has
high
drinkability
sours
are
not
my
favorite
and
despite
this
one
only
being
moderately
so
the
abv
keeps
this
one
a
sipper
and
one
is
enough
for
me
brick
store
continues
to
impress
for
its
12
anniversary
with
this
one
on
tap
pours
a
cloudy
reddish
brown
color
with
a
thin
almost
non
existent
head
as
it
warms
a
nice
sour
cherry
nose
comes
from
the
beer
a
slight
malt
sweetness
rests
in
the
background
of
the
aroma
taste
is
an
incredible
sour
cherry
flavor
but
does
not
overwhelm
with
sour
it
is
very
balanced
as
i
continued
to
sip
other
fruits
came
through
strawberries
and
apples
most
predominantly
there
is
a
still
a
decent
maltcaramel
sweetness
to
it
as
well
very
complex
i
am
not
sure
i
can
even
list
all
the
flavors
its
nice
that
it
is
sour
but
that
does
not
overwhelm
the
other
flavors
as
high
as
it
is
in
abv
with
low
carbonation
and
with
3
blends
in
the
brew
it
is
still
rather
light
in
your
mouth
definitely
a
sipping
beer
both
in
the
heat
it
brings
and
to
enjoy
all
the
flavors
it
provides
a
highly
enjoyable
final
beer
for
me
last
night
overall
a
really
complex
and
enjoyable
brew
glad
to
have
tried
it
and
would
recommend
for
fans
of
sours
im
not
sure
i
will
be
revisiting
this
for
a
while
given
the
price
but
i
can
see
that
being
a
struggle
for
me
drinkability
high
i
believe
my
wife
called
me
a
pig
when
she
asked
me
for
a
refill
and
i
told
her
i
had
already
finished
the
bottle
the
beer
is
near
the
upper
end
of
medium
bodied
with
lively
carbonation
the
mouthfeel
is
dry
and
champagnelike
at
26
this
is
definitely
pricey
but
if
you
like
the
style
this
is
worth
seeking
out
overall
a
delightful
beer
that
i
would
be
happy
to
have
at
anytime
would
love
to
try
some
fresh
to
compare
with
this
aged
version
drinkability
it
was
very
easy
to
drink
with
little
taste
of
alcohol
drinks
more
like
a
wine
then
a
beer
d
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
its
my
first
biere
de
garde
but
hopefully
not
my
last
d
definitely
a
sipper
it
will
take
me
a
while
to
get
through
this
bottle
the
15
5
abv
is
very
concealed
and
an
unexpected
buzz
creeps
up
on
you
and
warms
you
very
nicely
d
this
beer
had
a
pleasant
tartness
but
it
was
soft
and
there
wasnt
any
depth
of
flavor
after
that
the
flavor
was
a
bit
drab
and
that
stung
a
bit
considering
the
price
tag
and
all
the
hype
around
this
beer
i
dont
know
if
age
would
bring
out
more
funk
flavors
but
im
not
willing
to
take
the
gamble
good
stuff
a
treat
on
tap
at
the
blind
tiger
in
nyc
a
few
nights
ago
got
to
meet
the
brewer
of
the
stuff
that
night
to
boot
8
50
for
a
12
ounce
pour
btw
poured
totally
muddy
lighter
brown
later
pours
were
no
less
muddy
but
were
darker
in
color
no
head
no
lace
low
low
carbonation
sour
yet
soft
lactic
nose
complex
flavorful
quite
interesting
and
totally
different
type
of
beer
im
thinking
to
my
self
what
damn
style
of
beer
is
the
mother
more
sour
tons
of
soft
fruit
undertones
spiced
up
bloody
maryclamato
notes
all
sorts
of
stuff
going
on
here
somehow
it
holds
together
absolutely
delicious
gonna
buy
a
bottle
as
soon
as
i
get
a
few
extra
bucks
highly
recommended
light
in
body
crisply
carbonated
i
am
amazed
that
this
is
15
5
abv
where
do
they
hide
it
a
nice
soft
body
subtle
yet
present
carbonation
and
wonderful
flavors
leads
to
an
impressively
pleasurable
beer

strange
and
wonderful
notes
from
42707
this
beer
is
fantastic
in
bottle
but
is
just
a
complete
joy
on
draft
also
according
to
the
beer
menu
at
maxs
the
abv
is
dialed
down
considerably
with
the
draft
version
not
that
its
exactly
a
session
beer
but
the
10
abv
on
draft
is
much
more
manageable
then
the
15
plus
ive
generally
seen
in
bottle
regardless
in
either
format
this
is
a
beer
to
be
sought
out
and
revered
simply
outstanding
more
please
i
had
this
at
a
nice
little
place
called
beer
table
in
park
slope
brooklyn
at
18
it
was
by
far
the
most
expensive
half
pint
or
so
that
ive
ever
had
and
while
i
was
happy
to
be
drinking
it
at
the
time
pretty
soon
after
i
left
i
knew
that
it
hadnt
been
worth
it
thats
not
to
say
it
wasnt
an
interesting
beer
it
was
served
from
a
cask
very
little
no
carbonation
no
head
and
no
lacing
it
was
watery
brown
to
red
in
color
and
had
a
slight
sour
smell
and
taste
that
was
at
first
quite
offputting
but
after
a
few
more
sips
i
got
over
this
initial
response
and
was
able
to
enjoy
it
for
what
it
is
dont
know
that
its
what
most
people
would
consider
a
beer
but
its
full
of
complex
mixed
flavors
and
if
youre
feeling
flush
at
least
is
worth
a
try

tremendously
well
balanced
and
very

pleasant
sourness
that
unlike
the
dissedent
i
tried
a
couple
days
ago
doesnt
become
overbearingly
acidic
the
oak
component
is
really
terrific
and
adds
delicious
notes
of
vanilla
toasted
wood
and
also
a
unique
vinouslike
juiciness
a
stunning
effort
and
an
expertly
crafted
ale
m
d
marvelously
dry
and
rich
with
a
shimmer
of
carbonation
giving
it
a
quality
of
a
sweet
highcarbonated
red
wine
in
some
ways
a
beautiful
creation
and
something
of
a
masterpiece
imo
recommended
while
not
overly
heavy
this
is
somehow
a
sipping
beer
it
really
reminds
me
a
lot
of
a
fruity
berry
focused
oak
aged
red
wine
of
some
sort
with
a
touch
of
tartness
thrown
in
an
interesting
beer
that
is
for
sure
the
slight
carbonation
makes
it
seem
that
much
more
winelike
this
is
definitely
a
good
sipping
beer
i
certainly
wouldnt
want
to
have
to
finish
a
bottle
by
myself
had
on
draft
at
beer
table
brooklyn
would
be
very
curious
to
try
in
a
bottle
but
the
draft
was
too
cool
to
pass
up
only
3
barrels
filled
slightly
opaque
deep
red
color
with
a
quick
dissapating
head
strong
sour
woody
smell
masked
the
big
booze
almost
entirely
sour
grape
and
slight
rotten
fruit
taste
in
the
best
possible
way
rich
lingering
woody
aftertaste
and
puckering
sour
mouthfeel
amazing
bev
ill
have
to
get
a
bottle
to
age
early
in
the
sun
with
my
boy
stumac
pours
a
brown
dark
brown
colour
has
oak
chocolate
cherries
tar
and
other
grab
bag
candies
tastes
like
cherries
a
bit
bold
yet
still
quite
balanced
a
great
brew
indeed
quality
and
crazy
mixed
in
a
750
bottle
anyway
my
main
problem
is
that
the
price
of
admission
is
on
the
high
side
youll
have
to
decide
if
its
worth
it
or
not
considering
you
can
get
similar
or
greater
complexity
for
less
money
im
really
on
the
fence
with
this
one
poured
maroonish
light
head
smell
was
funky
and
sour
tasted
like
sour
cherries
with
some
woodiness
to
it
a
little
steep
on
the
price
but
thanks
to
bush
i
bought
it
anyways
quite
drinkable
for
a
sour
overall
i
was
blown
away
by
this
one
i
knew
it
would
be
good
i
just
did
not
think
it
would
be
this
goo
rich
and
full
vibrant
and
yet
mellow
and
subdued
easily
one
of
the
best
i
have
had
in
a
very
long
time
and
i
would
seek
this
one
out
again
with
no
issue
at
all
pours
dark
and
cloudy
maroon
with
light
tan
head
smell
is
sweet
and
sour
funky
and
fruity
some
cherry
in
the
nose
taste
is
mildish
but
of
quite
tart
cherries
and
is
somewhat
vinuous
in
flavor
too
very
smooth
yet
tart
red
fruit
was
abundant
really
enjoyable
thanks
again
quite
a
price
tag
on
this
one
and
although
good
i
doubt
i
will
buy
it
again
pours
an
orange
chestnut
with
almost
no
head
somewhat
light
smell
very
tannic
with
oak
some
acetic
notes
some
bitter
nonhoppy
notes
and
a
touch
of
bandaid
strange
flavor
very
tannic
rubber
bands
bandaids
and
much
bitterness
along
with
quite
an
acetic
quality
not
great
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
slick
not
very
enjoyable
on
top
of
everything
else
it
tastes
quite
hot
very
drinkable
but
you
can
only
have
1
bottle
otherwise
youll
fall
right
over
no
serious
itll
hurt
you
or
someone
you
love
if
you
dont
watch
it
overall
this
is
an
amazing
beer
that
is
ideal
to
put
in
front
of
a
wine
snob
and
say
oh
yea
beer
cant
be
as
complex
as
wine
can
it
i
thank
the
beer
gods
along
with
the
brewer
for
crafting
this
delicious
liquid
mouthfeel
is
great
and
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
the
tastes
are
complex
the
carbonation
light
and
the
experience
damned
near
perfect
hopefully
this
brewmaster
will
once
again
return
to
monks
and
bring
more
of
these
swiss
tasties

that

have
this
one
again
it
didnt

like
an
off

just
not
very
good
2005
vintage
bottle
276
this
one
was
a
little
bit
hazy
and
a
dull
reddish
orange
it
had
a
frothy
ring
of
offwhite
foam
and
produced
a
bit
of
spotty
sticky
lacing
the
aroma
was
on
the
funky
tart
side
with
notes
of
lemon
and
berry
leather
straw
salt
and
faint
alcohol
tart
earthy
and
funky
flavour
crackery

with
a

plus
mild

medium

with

on
the

with
an
incredibly
smooth
texture
light
warmth
and
a
bit
dry
with
spicy
alcohol
flavour
in
the
finish
nice
complexity
yet
surprisingly
mellow
this
beer
drinks
like
its
67
which
can
really
get
you
in
trouble
scored
so
as
not
to
significantly
rock
the
boat
which
has
some
validity
because
there
is
such
a
wide
interpretation
of
style
allowed
this
limited
edition
expensive
beer
wouldve
had
popped
a
cork
if
it
had
one
it
was
foaming
that
much
out
of
the
bottle
like
champagne
it
was
a
murky
burgundy
color
and
formed
a
huge
light
tan
bubbly
head
that
vanished
quickly
with
little
lace
considering
how
it
bubbled
out
of
the
bottle
the
aroma
was
a
mix
of
cherry
grape
whiskey
and
wine
the
flavor
was
of
cherries
sour
apples
and
slightly
of
prunes
it
had
a
medium
light
body
and
a
tart
sudsy
finish
to
it
a
good
beer
but
fairly
expensive
and
limted
release
make
it
a
rare
treat
edit
the
more
this
warmed
up
the
more
the
port
flavors
and
sourness
developed
making
this
an
exceptionally
flavored
beer
i
will
definitely
buy
another
bottle
if
i
ever
see
it
again
the
swiss
french
belgian
beer
like
wine
made
by
cats
who
are
saints
but
are
named
after
dogs
gotta
love
it
high
carbonation
adds
to
a
bright
and
boisterous
mouthfeel
crisp
and
funky
with
a
lot
of
warmth
from
the
booze
the
11
abv
is
certainly
noticeable
very
interesting
and
certainly
worth
a
try
bottled
in
march
2007
limited
to
1276
bottles
for
the
swiss
market
and
6000
for
the
usa
ahh
and
of
course
i
had
the
bottle
276
in
case
somebody
still
havent
noticed
that
all
bottles
have
the
same
number
pours
a
hazy
dark
rubybrown
colour
with
no
residual
foam
the
aroma
is
vinous
woody
with
notes
of
sour
apples
and
pine
needles
the
solid
malt
body
is
supported
by
a
fair
carbonation
it
has
some
initial
sweetness
followed
and
quickly
dominated
by
a
robust
aciditysourness
very
long
woody
fruity
and
sour
finish
once
again
with
the
saint
bonchien
the
high
alcohol
content
is
wellhidden
while
you
drink
it
but
hurts
when
you
reach
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
very
contemplative
one
more
great
beer
from
jérôme
drinkability
is
great
complex
balanced
with
almost
no
trace
of
the
15
5
abv
it
has
the
funk
but
without
the
acidity
and
sourness
and
the
fruit
without
lingering
sweetness
an
interesting
and
truly
excellent
beer
definitely
looking
forward
to
trying
other
vintages
or
more
of
this
one
if
i
can
find
it
the
beer
poured
a
hazy
dark
brown
color
with
a
slight
tan
head
into
my
bfm
glass
the
aroma
of
the
beer
was
pleasing
there
was
some
vinous
qualities
in
the
beer
as
well
as
some
wood
tones
as
well
this
goes
the
same
for
the
taste
there
is
a
sour
vinous
taste
with
some
wood
and
earth
notes
as
well
the
taste
is
really
dominated
in
a
good
way
by
a
sour
funkiness
i
was
originally
suprised
that
this
years
version
of
bonchien
was
this
style
but
i
really
enjoy
it
and
rate
this
up
there
with
the
other
2
years
that
i
have
had
edit
tried
this
again
on
tap
and
found
it
quite
good
so
my
scores
have
been
bumped
accordingly
cheers
i
owe
nick
big
time
for
this
one
d
again
much
like
a
soothing
red
wine
yet
sharing
many
qualities
of
a
beer
the
alcohol
is
masked
very
well
especially
since
it
clocks
in
at
15
5
this
is
no
easy
task
flavors
and
complexity
are
phenomenal
and
has
excellent
balance
this
one
is
in
a
different
class
d
an
easy
to
drink
well
balanced
and
slightly
sour
ale
this
would
probably
benefit
well
from
aging
perhaps
some
of
the
edges
would
round
out
i
kept
coming
back
to
this
with
a
new
appreciation
in
each
sip
had
the
2009
version
at
bar
volo
a
great
drinkable
sour
drinkability
this
reminds
me
of
a
big
bold
cabernet
the
drinkability
is
great
i
cant
see
myself
refusing
something
so
complex
and
bold
this
was
probably
an
expensive
bottle
but
seek
it
out
if
you
wish
one
of
the
best
beers
of
all
time
ive
got
to
find
bottles
of
this
definitely
improves
as
it
warms
bottle
says
to
be
served
6164
degrees
it
is
certainly
best
as
it
nears
room
temperature
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
ever
had
and
definitely
worth
the
35
2005
vintage
pours
a
dark
copper
to
amber
red
hazy
with
a
very
small
flash
of
cream
and
white
bubbles
that
gather
on
the
surface
and
quickly
disappear
aroma
is
of
nice
tart
apples
and
mellow
sweet
cherries
slightly
lemony
as
well
along
with
some
spices
vanilla
and
dessert
breadiness
taste
is
a
good
sized
tartness
slightly
perfumy
and
soapy
a
sweet
fruitiness
flashes
midtaste
before
a
good
sized
woody
dryness
blends
with
the
tartness
into
the
aftertaste
medium
in
body
mainly
still
with
a
good
sized
dryness
that
accentuates
the
tartness
very
nice
aroma
on
this
beer
the
taste
was
very
good
as
well
not
as
multi
dimensional
as
the
aroma
though
in
my
opinion
while
i
definitely
enjoyed
the
tart
flavors
the
perfumy
and
soapy
finish
to
the
tartness
was
not
as
pleasing
alcohol
was
not
completely
unnoticeable
but
did
not
at
all
seem
to
be
in
the
15
percent
range
as
stated
on
the
label
very
enjoyable
and
interesting
beer
the
body
is
surprisingly
thin
silky
smooth
rounded
out
nicely
in
the
oak
little
carbonation
to
speak
of
not
even
a
hint
of
alcohol
would
be
just
as
refreshing
in
the
heat
of
summer
as
in
the
cold
of
winter
highly
recommended
if
you
can
get
your
mitts
on
this
rare
gem
bottle
courtesy
of
imtheoptimator
poured
a
medium
amber
color
ale
with
a
small
foamy
head
with
limited
retention
or
lacing
aroma
of
oak
and
tart
is
pretty
enticing
taste
is
a
mix
between
some
sweet
malt
oak
and
some
vinous
character
body
was
about
medium
full
with
some
very
low
carbonation
i
could
not
detect
any
alcohol
which
is
quite
a
feat
at
14
but
could
feel
the
effect
afterward
interesting
combination
between
the
malt
presence
of
a
biere
de
garde
and
a
flander
red
oak
presence
just
awesome
glad
i
tried
this
beer
i
remeber
this
750ml
bottle
was
a
pretty
penny
but
worth
every
cent
overall
this
beer
is
good
but
not
nearly
as
good
as
the
2004
vintage
maybe
its
just
the
bottles
ive
gotten
but
the
2005
just
isnt
as
well
integrated
as
it
could
be
it
has
too
much
alcohol
present
and
the
brett
overtakes
some
of
the
other
flavors
instead
of
supporting
them
good
but
not
great
without
question
this
is
one
of
the
highest
quality
beers
that
i
have
ever
had
the
pleasure
to
drink
but
dont
buy
this
thinking
that
youre
getting
a
standard
biere
de
garde
its
much
more
than
that
if
you
have
any
wino
friends
that
youre
trying
to
advocate
good
beer
to
this
is
the
one
supposedly
this
was
one
of
only
twelve
bottles
that
made
it
into
va
personally
i
feel
that
it
was
worth
every
penny
of
the
48
that
i
paid
for
it
thanks
to
jacob
for
getting
this
in
d
smooth
and
very
easy
for
10
abv
all
that
complexity
makes
it
something
to
be
savored
not
for
everybody
and
certainly
not
for
daily
consumption
but
a
very
very
interesting
drink
d
the
ale
is
wellmade
and
an
interesting
take
on
the
french
farmhouse
style
the
aging
in
various
grapebased
liquors
has
put
a
nice
spin
on
the
ale
even
with
a
10
abv
thanks
again

750
ml

8
oz
sample
this
one
pours
a
deep
burgundy
color
with
a
very
light
head
that
settles
at
a
ring
around
the
top
of
the
brew
this
one
has
ruby
highlites
with
no
carbonation
and
is
fairly
clear
nice
looker
the
aroma
on
this
one
is
big
in
tanniny
oak
light
puffs
of
alcohol
winelike
vinous
fruits
lots
of
wine
character
here
the
flavor
is
even
more
divine
huge
shiraz
spiceyness
and
oak
tannin
character
it
has
a
slight
sourness
and
a
mild
alcohol
this
one
is
definately
barrel
aged
first
with
the
beer
being
secondary
to
it
definate
notes
of
light
mustyness
as
well
i
really
like
this
a
lot
the
feel
is
moderate
with
no
carbonation
it
is
pretty
dry
as
well
i
am
very
impressed
with
this
one
it
has
a
lot
of
really
nice
red
wine
character
with
enough
of
the
musty
and
sour
character
i
like
from
a
farmhouse
beer
with
the
10
abv
it
is
detectable
but
not
at
all
obtrusive
i
think
it
even
adds
a
nice
complexity
here
this
one
was
worth
the
big
price
tag
truly
a
very
wild
ride
deep
brown
and
rusty
in
color
it
looks
like
a
glass
of
french
roast
coffee
but
shows
good
color
separation
the
nose
is
of
bing
cherries
with
a
touch
of
booziness
perhaps
from
the
use
of
grappa
barrels
its
a
little
floral
too
lavendar
and
exotic
spices
awesome
stuff
a
great
beer
to
lay
down
a
while
it
still
shows
some
youthful
hard
edges
and
definitely
a
favorite
for
wine
drinkers
dark
and
opaque
purplebrown
color
head
is
fairly
nice
big
bubbles
and
average
duration
laces
in
fat
rings
boozy
aroma
seems
to
have
a
lot
of
grape
influence
but
not
being
an
appreciator
of
wines
it
just
seems
rather
heavy
and
oppressive
mouthfeel
is
almost
thick
carbonation
underdone
but
still
apparent
for
me
a
lot
of
the
delicate
spiciness
and
yeastiness
of
the
beer
at
least
what
may
have
been
the
original
beer
is
overwhelmed
by
a
heavy
application
of
alcohol
as
in
fortified
red
wine
especially
by
the
swallow
which
has
a
peppery
tannic
quality
to
it
the
impression
seems
very
pronounced
some
bittersweet
chocolate
helps
out
on
this
one
frankly
i
can
appreciate
the
time
and
effort
in
making
this
brew
but
im
not
particularly
impressed
with
the
profile
and
its
not
worth
the
cost
to
me
but
others
mileage
should
vary
i
tried
this
yesterday
at
the
seattle
international
beerfest
it
is
really
hard
to
pin
down
what
exactly
was
going
on
with
it
first
of
all
it
pours
a
translucent
brown
with
a
reddish
tint
to
it
the
tan
head
disappears
almost
instantly
smelling
it
one
gets
a
wiff
of
fruit
before
beer
kind
of
an
applegrape
mixture
there
is
no
bite
to
it
the
taste
being
incredibly
smooth
and
it
feels
almost
like
champagne
on
the
tongue
really
toes
the
line
between
sparkling
wine
and
beer
aside
from
being
exorbitantly
pricey
manages
to
be
a
very
drinkable
beer
despite
the
slight
sourness
and
overall
conglomerate
of
tastes
overall
meh
probably
my
least
fav
beer
from
them
yet
nothing
really
fun
about
this
beer
too
sweet
syrupy
with
way
too
much
booze
and
the
spices
are
ok
but
not
great
for
what
it
is
there
are
so
many
better
places
this
beer
could
have
gone
o
not
bad
as
a
holiday
time
brew
dominated
by
a
combination
of
fruit
and
caramel
malt
notes
but
the
result
isnt
far
from
resembling
a
lightweight
cough
syrup
which
both
i
and
my
daughter
found
a
bit
offputting
but
we
drank
it
all
nonetheless

creamy

a

surprisingly
thin

but
the

is

this
beer
does
not

the
sour
or
earthy
tones
i
expect
from
a

i
find
this
one
to
be
far
more
drinkable
than
most
two
roadss
holiday
ale
is
a
very
typical
winter
style
ale
deep
rich
color
coupled
with
a
strongbutnottoostrong
taste
and
an
aroma
more
on
the
fruit
side
good
stuff
o
for
me
there
are
better
options
strong
but
good
this
was
a
very
enjoyable
brew
i
appreciated
the
subtleties
of
yeast
aromas
and
different
malts
with
the
slight
spice
from
the
continental
hops
not
a
hityouintheface
brew
but
a
delightful
one
nonetheless
one
of
the
better
brews
from
two
roads
that
ive
tried
this
is
worth
picking
up
from
your
local
package
store
in
the
large
format
to
share
with
a
friend
strikes
a
balance
between
spices
and
a
belgianfeeling
yeast
fruits
and
caramelized
sugars
are
fairly
big
but
overall
i
think
it
finds
its
flavor
well
and
delivers
without
relying
on
blatant
in
your
face
flavors
a
solid
brew
all
around
pours
a
mild
brown
with
an
offwhite
head
that
dissipates
and
leaves
trails
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
sweet
from
the
malt
with
scents
of
clove
and
walnuts
the
taste
was
nice
with
heavy
malt
starting
off
and
in
the
middle
giving
a
very
mellow
and
earthy
tone
to
the
beer
while
the
finish
had
just
enough
hops
for
a
refreshing
crisp
end
liked
this
one
a

22oz

this

a

there
was

head
that
didnt
leave
much

the
nose
is
good
a

spicy
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
clove
faint

the
flavor
is
quite
good
a
but
bready
and
malty
with

there
a
faint
earthiness
to
it
ill
be
looking
for
this
again

overall
could
use
a

flavor
on

at
the

in

ct
poured
into
a
founders
pint
glass
very
earthy
brown
hue
with
almost
no
head
or
carbonation
no
lacing
in
the
glass
looks
and
tates
a
bit
like
a
barleywine
with
obviously
less
ethanol
wonderful
spicy
cinnamon
aftertaste
with
lots
of
roasted
malt
and
a
pinch
of
hops
looking
for
an
ipa
alternative
that
goes
well
with
both
meats
and
dessert
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
o
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
to
filling
good
kick
good
americanized
representation
of
style
this
is
a
solid
beer
to
drink
for
a
while
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
the
style
overall
nice
to
see
two
roads
can
do
a
malty
big
beer
well
this
was
easily
the
maltiest
of
their
offerings
to
date
a
nice
and
complex
holiday
sipper
i
will
certainly
get
this
again
if
it
is
on
tap
when
i
am
in
town
o
this
is
an
interesting
bière
de
garde
and
seems
to
share
some
properties
that
you
would
expect
from
a
belgian
strong
dark
ale
except
for
the
higher
alcohol
content
on
tap
at
j
ryans
downtown
syracuse
the
pour
is
clear
amber
to
cranberry
juice
in
color
with
the
red
hues
really
glowing
there
is
only
a
finger
or
two
of
lacey
tan
head
but
it
fades
out
in
a
few
minutes
the
nose
is
really
remarkable
entirely
unfamiliar
i
smell
some
purple
grape
juice
or
must
the
essence
of
fresh
cherries
but
nothiing
sweet
at
all
theres
also
a
rich
caramel
malt
sweetness
and
something
curious
with
the
yeast
as
well
mildly
but
uniquely
spiced
the
flavors
are
really
fruity
up
front
again
with
what
seems
to
be
grape
being
the
most
obvious
some
spice
in
there
as
well
it
isnt
clove
or
allspice
but
has
a
peculiarly
holiday
vibe
to
it
i
appreciate
this
beers
strange
but
comforting
flavor
profile
much
apart
from
anything
ive
ever
tasted
mouthfeel
is
a
little
odd
for
me
i
would
like
either
more
body
or
more
bubbles
in
this
beer
without
the
body
it
feels
thin
and
watery
and
without
the
bubbles
it
lacks
the
pep
needed
to
make
a
thinner
beer
feel
good
going
down
that
is
definitely
the
weakness
here
overall
though
i
am
so
glad
i
got
one
of
these
because
while
it
is
certainly
a
christmas
beer
there
is
something
unlike
any
other
christmas
beer
about
it
and
that
originality
really
makes
its
something
to
behold
the
pour
is
amber
in
color
with
a
tall
offwhite
head
sweet
caramel
and
toffee
with
a
little
bit
of
sugar
lots
of
dark
fruits
on
the
nose
too
there
is
a
touch
of
spice
and
maybe
some
apples
the
flavor
is
fairly
sweet
mostly
sugar
with
some
caramel
a
decent
amount
of
dark
fruits
especially
raisins
and
plums
not
bad
at
all
o
pleasant
to
drink
but
it
does
not
knock
my
socks
off
o
too
me
there
was
a
lot
missing
here
but
maybe
thats
what
they
were
going
for
not
sure
but
cant
say
id
come
back
to
this
again
another
possibility
is
that
it
might
just
need
to
be
enjoyed
fresh
o
its
alright
pretty
drinkable
not
exceptional
might
as
well
try
it
if
you
find
one
o
overall
an
enjoyable
drinkable
pleasant
if
mediocre
beer
the
sticker
price
is
the
kicker
3
99
for
this
bottle
is
a
steal
highly
recommended
if
you
can
find
it
for
a
comparable
price
i
got
mine
at
a
total
wine
more
i
might
buy
another
one
next
season
overall
very
interesting
brew
more
intriguing
than
i
thought
it
would
be
not
a
bad
taste
either
overall
not
great
not
awful
worth
trying
fuller
bodied
than
expected
with
a
nicebalance
of
zesty
spice
funky
yeast
earthy
hops
dark
fruit
and
sweet
malt
a
touch
of
bitterness
up
frontfollowed
by
peppery
spice
that
lingers
over
a
slight
medicinal
character
into
a
dry
finish
hints
of
dark
cherry
with
a
nice
malt
backbone
coutering
the
fruitsweetness
hints
of
caramelmaltandbiscuittowardthefinish
complex
and
much
more
flavorful
than
expected
a
nice
salad
beer
years
ago
i
thought
the
jenlain
duyck
beers
were
the
best
in
france
either
ive
changed
my
taste
or
theyve
changed
their
beers
overall
each
sip
was
a
bit
worse
than
the
last
frankly
i
was
quite
glad
to
be
done
with
it
and
no
i
didnt
get
through
the
entire
bottle
nothing
resembling
a
quality
bière
de
garde
here
at
all
pours
a
murky
semiopaque
dark
iced
tea
color
with
a
tiny
12
tan
head
that
fades
to
an
oily
film
on
the
top
of
the
beer
a
few
stands
of
random
lace
on
the
drink
down
smells
of
muted
caramel
malt
and
some
citrus
juices
taste
is
of
caramels
biscuity
malt
and
some
light
grapefruit
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
no
bitterness
whatsoever
with
this
beer
very
light
but
lively
carbonation
somewhat
sticky
and
coating
in
the
mouth
overall
a
good
holiday
offering
that
is
still
very
tasty
months
after
its
release
interesting
beer
not
what
id
usually
consider
a
christmas
beer
id
actually
prefer
something
like
this
in
the
summer
with
its
zingy
citron
and
lemon
notes
married
to
a
bit
of
brown
sugar
and
bitter
orange
whenever
id
enjoy
this
it
pours
an
orangey
amber
with
a
fairly
short
head
that
fades
to
a
thin
cap
the
aroma
is
pure
orange
juice
with
a
bit
of
spice
at
the
end
the
taste
reminds
me
of
an
english
lemon
barley
water
a
bit
soupy
with
grain
but
in
a
light
sort
of
way
and
with
a
nice
citrus
overlay
that
is
quite
refreshing
it
starts
out
lemony
but
as
it
opens
up
it
tastes
more
of
tangerine
and
orange
with
hint
of
spice
quite
nice
perhaps
a
tad
too
light
and
seltzery
in
the
mouthfeel
but
ovarall
this
is
a
nice
refresher
but
not
what
id
be
looking
for
in
a
winter
brew
notes
od
candied
sugar
victory
malt
and
complex
hop
finish
subtle
residual
caramel
flavoring
and
impressive
belgian
lacing
beer
appears
to
be
dry
hopped
with
multiple
hops
light
and
creamy
on
the
toungue
with
a
distinct
after
taste
definitely
worth
a
try
but
not
worth
seeking
out
d
a
below
average
beer
with
a
slight
metal
smell
and
taste
wouldnt
seek
out
again
a
lighter
bubblier
christmas
ale
brilliantly
clear
ruddy
copper
with
an
off
white
head
that
disappears
with
little
traces
on
the
glass
smell
is
quite
different
ginger
and
citrus
with
a
sweet
light
caramel
and
a
bit
of
malt
taste
is
sweet
and
orangey
spiced
chai
tea
with
ginger
and
sugary
sweet
malt
light
well
carbonated
feel
is
crisp
on
the
tongue
as
it
warms
the
the
sugary
caramel
mellows
and
blends
into
the
malt
structure
dry
clean
finish
hops
are
subdued
to
say
the
least
refreshing
and
quite
drinkable
like
a
sweet
lager
not
in
the
usual
holiday
mold
but
then
again
it
is
french
vive
le
difference
im
going
to
forgo
the
usual
detailed
review
because
i
only
took
a
few
sips
of
this
beer
before
dumping
the
rest
and
thats
hard
for
such
an
expensive
beer
the
caramel
sweetness
was
overpowering
unbearably
cloying
seems
like
an
unsuccessful
homebrew
that
hasnt
finished
attenuation
consider
yourself
warned
d
fantastic
this
is
one
of
the
best
balanced
spice
beers
ive
had
in
a
while
i
also
appreciate
the
use
of
a
lager
yeast
that
adds
lightness
to
the
body
great
job
on
this
one
jenlain
poured
into
an
imperial

color
a
very
thin
bubbly
head
that
didnt
last
long
at
all
constant
streams
of
bubbles
rose
from
the
bottom
aroma
was
very
slightly
sweet
with
earthiness
a
touch
of
malty
with
evident
alcohol
aromas
taste
was
very
mellow
slightly
sweet
small
amounts
of
citrus
flavors
tad
of
olives
and
hops
flavors
felt
strange
in
the
mouth
coated
well
but
left
an
awkward
texture
in
the
mouth
definitely
a
beer
to
sit
and
sip
lingering
makes
it
ok
to
drink
but
need
to
savor
while
it
is
in
the
bière
de
garde
style
it
seems
to
lack
holiday
spirit
drinkable
enough
to
finish
the
bottle
but
would
not
seek
another
d
a
pretty
good
beer
overall
definitely
not
like
most
christmas
beers
but
not
in
a
bad
way
worth
checking
out
if
you
want
a
different
christmas
beer
pretty
solid
atmosphere
on
this
one
appearance
is
better
than
average
and
the
nose
is
really
pleasing
although
i
could
see
how
you
could
get
too
much
of
it
quick
good
thing
this
is
only
a
christmas
brew
flavor
is
pretty
basic
nothing
overwhelming
but
nice
combination
of
flavors
it
does
sport
overall
this
is
a
pretty
solid
quaff
nice
stuff
would
likely
order
this
again
drinkability
interesting
beer
overall
even
if
i
cant
really
place
it
as
biere
de
garde
doesnt
seem
to
mean
much
here
dhavent
had
many
beers
in
this
style
and
didnt
know
what
to
expect
i
guess
i
thought
it
might
be
a
little
richer
tasting
a
nice
new
style
of
beer
for
me
enjoyable
similar
a
little
to
a
saison
which
is
not
one
of
my
favorite
styles
overall
this
is
a
solid
beer
and
an
enjoyable
one
to
try
but
not
one
i
would
want
again
this
beer
pours
a
crystal
clear
amber
color
with
a
nice
dense
off
white
head
the
aroma
shows
off
its
farmhouse
pedigree
along
with
a
bit
of
fruit
esters
the
taste
really
produces
on
the
fruit
flavor
but
is
lacking
in
the
spiciness
that
i
would
hope
for
in
this
sort
of
beer
the
body
is
a
good
full
body
with
adequate
co2
but
missing
the
alcohol
bite
that
couldve
put
it
over
the
top
not
a
bad
beer
but
couldve
been
better
the
beer
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
dry
and
slightly
fruity
scent
as
well
as
a
mild
crystal
malt
aroma
the
taste
is
average
it
has
a
thin
and
watery
crystal
malt
flavor
that
does
have
some
light
nuttiness
in
the
finish
but
overall
is
dry
and
boring
its
a
bit
fruity
with
some
light
musty
character
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
an
above
average
beer
but
nothing
too
great
especially
for
a
once
a
year
offering
drinkable
but
very
worth
passing
up
drinkability
a
very
unusual
beer
that
while
both
sweet
and
tart
is
nicely
understated
other
than
the
aftertaste
this
is
quite
nice
conclusion
this
is
an
odd
earthy
tart
fruity
beer
but
its
kind
of
tasty
and
unique
at
the
same
time
i
might
give
this
one
another
shot
next
christmas
overall
the
deep
robust
fruitiness
make
this
a
good
desert
beer
d
this
is
really
an
exceptional
bière
de
garde
im
always
found
of
the
continental
approach
of
making
stronger
imperial
is
perhaps
an
inappropriate
descriptor
though
versions
of
their
standard
beers
to
be
interesting
this
one
doesnt
disappoint
while
ive
had
other
tasty
bière
de
garde
from
other
french
breweries
jenlain
is
the
international
standard
and
it
is
rightly
deserved
as
exemplified
in
this
beer
poured
into
my
corsendonk
christmas
ale
glass
a
nice
cloudy
golden
amber
color
nice
carbonation
nice
little
fizzycreamy
offwhite
head
theres
some
nice
stickycreamy
lacing
left
behind
the
nose
is
malty
yeasty
nice
touch
of
floral
the
taste
is
sweet
malty
with
some
yeast
very
slight
citrus
medium
body
very
drinkable
this
brew
goes
down
very
easy
highly
recommended
im
not
sure
what
else
to
say
the
fact
that
i
spent
7
99
on
this
750
makes
me
want
to
cry
if
you
see
jenlain
noel
on
the
shelves
run
screaming
in
the
other
direction
as
fast
as
your
legs
will
carry
you
youre
welcome
overall
a
decent
bier
de
garde
the
orange
adds
a
nice
flavor
for
the
season
i
found
i
had
consumed
most
of
the
bottle
without
really
thinking
about
it
very
easy
to
drink
despite
the
flavors
this
beer
has
held
up
really
well
if
it
is
a
2005
bottling
certainly
not
the
greatest
beer
and
even
fresh
i
have
a
feeling
it
was
not
all
that
great
it
is
somewhat
refreshing
but
a
bit
too
simplistic
and
a
bit
to
sharp
in
the
finish
d
overall
a
pretty
enjoyable
beer
with
nice
spice
present
but
perhaps
not
the
most
festive
beer
on
the
arket
in
terms
of
taste
an
overall
good
brew
review
translated
from
french

beer
is
good
happy
french
beering
pours
clear
dark
amber
with
halfinch
of
thin
offwhite
head
recedes
rapidly
to
a
blanket
of
foam
excellent
lacing
the
aroma
is
peculiar
and
not
very
appealing
musty
white
pepper
notes
are
dominant
with
tinges
of
metallic
hop
lurking
in
the
background
flavor
is
much
like
the
nose
lots
of
musty
white
pepper
all
the
way
through
with
unpleasant
metallic
hop
notes
bringing
up
the
rear
body
is
light
with
plenty
of
carbonation
somewhat
acerbic
in
the
finish
not
good
at
all
the
drinkability
of
this
was
not
that
high
the
orange
got
to
be
a
little
much
im
not
sure
if
they
used
artificial
flavor
or
some
type
of
rich
orange
variety
that
im
unfamiliar
with
but
it
was
a
little
syrupy
tasting
after
a
while
though
not
in
body
still
a
good
experience
and
nice
change
of
pace
for
a
noel
ill
cellar
one
to
see
if
time
tempers
the
orange
drinkability
i
found
this
to
be
enjoyable
and
a
bit
different
from
the
other
xmas
beers
on
the
market
worth
giving
it
a
try
so
i
bought
this
one
with
great
interest
very
similar
to
its
sister
brother
beer
and
it
definitely
is
a
tasty
beer
but
to
me
the
added
spices
the
higher
alcohol
content
and
associated
roughness
to
the
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
take
this
down
a
notch
i
like
this
its
enjoyable
but
not
as
good
pours
out
a
pretty
copper
body
with
a
steady
stream
of
carbonation
coming
from
the
center
of
the
chalice
not
much
of
a
head
starts
with
a
punch
of
orange
juice
in
the
nose
with
aromas
of
vanilla
toasted
malty
bread
and
some
alcohol
again
with
the
flavors
i
get
a
creamsicle
like
flavor
up
front
which
is
followed
by
loads
of
toasted
malt
dried
fruit
and
a
little
alcohol
i
get
noble
hops
in
the
finish
and
a
lingering
flavor
of
raisin
bread
too
much
orange
though
mouthfeel
is
moderate
to
slightly
thick
and
has
a
soft
carbonation
made
up
of
tiny
bubbles
tasty
beer
but
the
orange
presence
can
be
a
bit
much
to
make
this
something
id
want
a
lot
of
i
got
tired
of
the
orange
real
quick
taste
is
balanced
and
even
orange
candy
kind
of
floats
in
and
isnt
too
sweet
or
cloying
nice
malty
backbone
even
mouthfeel
a
butterscotchdiacetyl
taste
rides
through
in
the
aftertaste
a
bittermetal
note
is
the
only
element
out
of
place
otherwise
its
a
great
seasonal
quaffer
taste
is
a
nice
biscuity
malt
followed
by
the
unusual
floral
hops
far
less
dominant
in
the
flavor
the
hops
finishes
surprisingly
clean
with
a
crisp
hoppy
finish
mouth
is
medium
only
faint
hops
in
the
aftertaste
really
good
and
really
drinkable
i
could
recommend
this
beer
for
the
aroma
alone
d
interesting
beer
becomes
a
bit
too
much
after
a
while
but
fun
while
it
lasted
overall
brewed
only
once
a
year
and
pretty
much
the
jenlain
ambrée
with
a
little
supercharging
on
the
malts
and
hops
very
nice
though
and
great
value
at
6
for
once
i
saved
this
beer
for
thanksgiving
and
man
was
that
a
good
call
on
my
part
this
beer
goes
very
well
with
everything
at
the
traditional
table
from
salad
to
pumpkin
pie
in
fact
i
think
it
may
have
matched
the
pumpkin
pie
the
best
i
was
really
amazed
at
the
versatility
of
this
beer
at
the
table
ill
definately
be
picking
up
another
few
bottles
of
this
for
next
year
it
is
hard
to
say
what
the
aging
did
for
it
since
i
never
had
it
young
but
i
suspect
that
orange
flavor
might
have
been
a
tad
much
when
fresh
not
like
any
saison
ive
ever
had
not
sure
i
like
this
one
though
i
dont
hate
it
either
drinkability
surprisingly
wellbalanced
not
at
all
what
i
was
expecting
something
fruity
and
sickly
sweet
which
wound
up
being
a
good
thing
but
not
great
in
its
own
right
either
just
a
very
good
balanced
taste
profile
beverage
that
worked
for
my
friend
and
i
for
supper
orange
taste
was
apparent
and
not
over
the
top
a
nice
biere
de
garde
moderated
spicey
taste
overall
some
citrus
not
too
bitter
nor
sweet
perhaps
it
was
aged
some
as
the
label
claims
this
is
a
special
biere
de
garde
ambree
with
a
new
orange
flavor
the
citrus
is
most
defined
in
the
bouquet
which
has
a
pleasant
orange
character
otherwise
this
brew
pours
a
light
amber
and
has
a
light
spritzy
body
on
the
tongue
there
are
fairly
pronounced
citrus
and
biscuit
flavors
too
but
they
are
never
quite
able
to
overcome
the
fizziness
of
the
mouthfeel
it
is
then
an
imbalanced
mouthfeel
that
proved
to
be
this
beers
biggest
drawback
drinkability
is
average
though
i
doubt
that
i
would
be
interested
in
exploring
this
brew
further
to
have
more
than
one
glass
pours
a
dark
reddish
color
with
a
quickly
disappearing
white
head
smell
is
of
orange
peel
and
some
spice
taste
is
sort
of
like
watered
down
orange
pop
which
isnt
a
good
thing
this
could
have
been
so
much
better
but
it
wasnt
mouthfeel
was
thin
with
medium
carbonation
i
didnt
really
care
for
this
one
i
would
maybe
try
it
again
in
a
very
distant
future
it
was
worth
a
try
but
probably
not
worth
another
try
for
a
while
looks
and
tastes
like
kiddy
champagne
like
the
apple
or
white
grape
stuff
that
you
give
to
ten
year
olds
at
new
years
only
this
stuff
tastes
and
looks
like
orange
jello
i
will
hand
it
bitterness
this
beer
definitely
has
some
great
bitterness
both
in
nose
and
mf
that
part
of
the
orange
tastes
real
otherwise
this
fits
perfectly
into
frances
love
for
crappy
fruity
light
beers
to
guzzle
and
get
tanked
on
this
is
just
candy
large
bottle
caged

corked
label
in

besides
english
says
something
about
consuming
before
some
date
i
think
but
i
can
see
no
dates
something
about
jenlain
never
makes
sense
to
me
maybe
its
the
green
bottles
or
the
fact
that
the
bottles
allways
seem
to
be
slightly
underfilled
anyway
i
digress
this
one
pours

i
really
enjoy

other
than
that
this

still
this
is
a
pretty
good
deal
at

for

this
is
a

that
i
would
gladly
serve

a

the

is

here
this

25cl
bottle
this
beer
pours
a
crystal
clear
amber
color
there
was
a
bit
of
a
tan
head
that
lingers
for
awhile
some
spices
and
notes
of
orange
to
the
nose
the
taste
is
a
bit
spicy
with
notes
of
the
orange
a
medium
malty
body
backing
it
up
not
bad
for
a
french
supermarket
beer
backwash
i
was
quite
surprised
and
happy
to
come
across
this
at
the
bottom
of
a
crate
of
miscellaneous
wines
although
shelton
brothers
is
expected
to
bring
this
back
to
the
usa
along
with
some
of
duycks
regular
offerings
i
havent
seen
the
christmas
version
of
this
beer
for
a
long
time
i
hope
this
does
return
as
its
probably
duycks
best
offering
improving
upon
the
already
good
regular
bière
de
garde
although
only
0
3
stronger
this
is
a
much
richer
warming
beer
with
a
great
deal
more
complexity
than
the
standard
expression
i
dont
remember
what
i
paid
for
this
but
i
dont
think
it
was
much
more
than
the
3
493
99
that
the
regular
750s
sold
for
this
price
is
likely
to
go
up
with
the
euro
and
the
passage
of
time
but
im
sure
this
will
remain
a
bit
of
a
bargain
this
was
one
of
the
earliest
christmas
beers
i
can
remember
being
readily
available
and
its
still
one
of
the
better
ones
now
if
only
sheltons
would
bring
in
the
minikegs
overall
a
very
fine
traditional
example
of
a
hard
to
fine
style
glad
i
found
this
beauty
we
dont
a

overall
a

nicely
put

beer
orchard

toasted

the

is
a
very
nice
touch
not
a
terrible
price
either

for

x
750ml
food
match
blanquette
de
veau
with
lyonnaise
potatoes
or
pavés
du
mail
would
be
a
nice
pairing
the
creaminess
of
their
sauces
countering
the
cloying
sweetness
whilst
keeping
with
the
french
theme
of
this
brew
not
too
bad
i
really
enjoyed
the
sweetness
but
it
may
be
too
much
for
some
i
might
feel
a
bit
different
once
i
get
towards
the
end
of
the
bottle
o
not
a
bad
beer
but
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
liking
could
only
just
finish
the
one
gets
rather
sickly
after
a
while
overly
sweet
beer
with
low
complexity
not
really
pleasant
after
warming
up
i
kept
lowering
its
grade
definitely
overrated
o
the
hop
bitterness
and
flavor
comes
on
a
bit
stronger
than
in
other
examples
of
the
style
but
is
still
never
in
any
danger
of
usurping
the
malt
character
in
fact
the
flaw
of
this
beer
may
be
that
the
body
is
a
little
more
weighty
and
dextrinous
than
it
should
be
and
this
makes
it
less
drinkable
did
not
score
a
t
s
m
at
that
time
disregard
those
scores
a
bit
too
sweet
and
lacking
in
complexity
and
the
texture
is
a
letdown
too
the
basic
flavors
and
aromas
are
nice
but
the
aforementioned
faults
make
this
a
tepid
recommendation
at
best
definitely
worth
checking
out
this
poured
out
as
a
very
nice
clear
orange
color
with
a
thin
white
head
on
top
the
head
fades
quickly
no
retention
or
lacing
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
sweet
smelling
with
some
grain
aromas
maybe
a
hint
of
honey
on
the
nose
too
the
taste
is
sweet
caramel
and
honeylike
flavors
with
minimal
hop
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
light
a
little
watery
some
moderate
carbonation
and
drinkable
overall
is
starts
out
sweet
with
a
dry
finish
its
a
good
brew
but
nothing
something
i
would
rave
about
750
ml
thats
been
sitting
in
the
cellarhall
closet
for
6
mos
or
so
sweet
and
brownamber
maltiness
very
slight
booziness
in
the
aroma
and
taste
but
its
not
hot
the
sweetness
lingers
and
makes
me
take
another
taste
because
it
is
pleasant
decent
head
after
a
fast
pour
subsequent
pours
yield
a
thin
head
with
some
lacing
initial
taste
showed
standard
carbonation
wanted
a
euro
biere
de
garde
after
drlinking
two
bros
domaine
du
page
which
isnt
too
far
off
overall
has
a
taste
up
my
alley
and
one
that
ill
revisit
soon
overall
pretty
solid

o
i
liked
this
beer
very
much
and
would
highly
recommend
it
very
sweet
but
perfect
for
those
cold
winter
days
when
a
something
stronger
or
darker
might
feel
like
overkill
highly
enjoyed
this
beer
if
only
for
the
fact
that
it
has
a
taste
one
can
enjoy
without
waiting
for
an
occasion
to
do
so
versatile
and
tasty
a
bit
sweeter
than
i
normally
like
but
a
great
farmhouse
ale
used
to
drink
it
frequently
when
i
worked
in
burgundy
it
has
a
sweet
aftertaste
and
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
like
cotton
candy
not
in
a
bad
way
a
little
pungent
to
the
nose
but
a
rich
like
chestnut
color
i
scored
the
overall
a
high
4
5
because
its
a
great
experiance
if
you
like
the
sweeter
ones
normally
i
dont
but
this
one
is
an
exception
malt
forward
but
not
totally
to
style
too
sweet
and
fruity
for
a
biere
de
garde
a
light
easy
drinker
though
and
probably
pairs
well
with
all
sorts
of
food
which
is
the
point
i
suspect
d
i
really
enjoyed
this
having
had
the
jenlain
blonde
an
hour
before
i
discovered
that
this
is
the
superior
beer
nose
was
better
feel
was
more
cohesive
flavors
were
better
executed
jd
dr
the
high
abv
is
pretty
well
concealed
and
she
drinks
easy
enough
the
price
is
good
by
french
standards
but
the
quality
just
isnt
there
a
good
beer
for
a
night
in
with
the
lads
but
not
a
good
beer
for
a
proper
tasting
d
good
smooth
flavor
easy
drink
i
would
have
another
doesnt
seem
to
have
any
off
flavors
or
hint
of
spoilage
so
i
totally
dont
get
this
beverage
the
real
question
is
when
will
beeradvocate
stop
running
irrelevant
ads
watery
and
weak
for
the
style
ill
not
be
getting
this
again
flavour
very
subtle
each
sip
drew
me
back
for
another
taste
of
its
elusive
layered
malt
and
subtle
nole
hops
presence
overall
way
too
sweet
without
any
significant
complexity
cant
recommend
this
one
d
way
too
much
ironcopper
metal
flavor
maybe
a
bad
bottle
o
this
is
okay
im
not
too
familiar
with
the
style
but
this
is
enjoyable
it
has
a
good
mouthfeel
and
is
very
lightbodied
the
finish
is
mediumdry
and
i
have
a
feeling
ill
be
able
to
get
through
the
rest
of
this
75cl
quite
easily
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
brew
was
the
surprisingly
fruity
aroma
with
the
contrasting
alcohol
kick
at
the
very
finish
while
the
abv
is
not
apparent
throughout
most
of
the
taste
it
comes
in
full
force
in
the
end
with
that
nice
peppery
burn
this
was
in
wonderful
contrast
to
the
sweetness
presented
in
both
the
nose
and
in
the
taste
making
for
a
nicely
balanced
brew
all
around
very
solid
clean
beer
enjoyed
it
i
need
to
visit
this
one
again
if
i
get
the
chance
to
get
some
more
deatiled
notes
overall
the
group
consensus
was
this
was
a
respectable
example
fo
the
style
i
just
need
to
try
a
few
more
before
i
can
make
a
more
objective
judgement
highly
underrated
250ml
bottle
poured
into
leffe
chalice
3rd
of
a
finger
head
dark
orange
copper
colour
clear
smells
a
bit
like
an
esb
can
taste
marzipan
and
malty
caramel
you
know
the
abv
is
there
medium
mouthfull
i
could
drink
a
few
but
wouldnt
want
too
many
d
any
traces
of
alcohol
are
completely
hidden
from
the
smell
and
taste
i
would
definitely
try
this
again
and
pair
it
with
food
such
as
pork
chops
pours
a
golden
copper
with
a
nice
white
head
and
some
good
lace
nose
is
fairly
tame
but
has
nice
characteristics
of
light
fruit
toffee
nuts
and
a
dash
of
earthiness
taste
is
mildly
sweet
and
fruity
a
bit
of
soil
in
there
feel
is
light
and
rewarding
a
mellow
well
integrated
beer
that
is
one
of
the
better
biere
de
gardes
that
i
have
tried
this
umber
brew
gives
just
a
trace
of
thin
white
head
thats
gone
immediately
smell
is
also
pretty
mild
just
a
faint
dark
sweetness
taste
is
a
fruity
plumlike
sweetness
a
bit
of
yeast
earthy
but
clean
and
crisp
feel
is
mostly
flat
and
medium
bodied
i
have
no
idea
what
to
expect
from
this
style
but
its
pretty
interesting
overall
a
nicely
drinkable
multifaceted
ale
well
balanced
even
reserved
but
solid
nonetheless
d
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
a
sweet
beer
this
really
hits
the
spot
i
had
this
on
a
hot
night
in
paris
and
it
went
down
well
i
had
this
bottle
in
my
cellar
for
quite
a
while
actually
beyond
the
so
called
expiry
date
but
it
still
tastes
fresh
and
crispy
the
brew
has
a
sort
of
artisanal
touch
everything
somewhat
looks
handmade
starting
with
the
bottle
the
muddy
appearance
and
a
not
very
elegant
balance
actually
to
my
surprise
even
though
this
brew
is
rather
tweedy
its
great
pleasure
drinking
it
caramelized
toffees
paired
with
vanilla
anisette
and
pineapple
sounds
rather
exotic
and
perhaps
is
but
for
sure
worth
a
try
if
only
they
could
work
on
the
slightly
unpleasant
sticky
bittersweet
aftertaste
the
beer
is
slightly
prickly
on
the
tongue
and
quite
refreshing
but
overall
fails
to
impress
d
this
beer
is
an
easy
sipper
good
but
not
great
but
ultimately
its
worth
trying
this
was
a
welcome
treat
much
more
flavor
than
expected
this
will
be
a
more
regular
purchase
its
malty
and
floury
im
not
a
pro
so
all
i
can
say
is
it
has
a
very
complex
array
of
flavors
the
malt
hits
strong
theres
a
kind
of
treebark
aftertaste
almost
portwineish
in
a
way
mouthfeel
is
fairly
thick
and
creamy
excellent
drinkability
beer
is
sweet
malt
bomb
alert
i
like
it
beer
is
overall
mild
there
is
some
fruity
character
like
sweet
berries
or
apples
in
the
midpalate
of
the
beer
drinkability
is
really
high
mouthfeel
is
moderate
beer
is
medium
bodied
not
sure
what
i
expected
overall
its
a
clean
and
simple
beer
i
should
seek
out
more
biere
de
garde
d
solid
across
the
board
quite
enjoyable
overall
a
tasty
beer
complex
nice
enough
nothing
too
complex
but
not
bad
at
all
d
this
is
a
nice
belgian
style
ale
it
has
a
nice
balance
of
spice
and
sweet
dim
pretty
sure
this
is
the
best
beer
ive
ever
had
out
of
a
50
cl
can
it
is
not
complex
but
it
is
just
plain
good
i
wouldnt
drink
too
much
of
this
it
isnt
worth
revisiting
edit
after
reading
some
other
reveiws
it
seems
as
though
my
opinions
were
not
that
far
off
from
the
lower
end
of
the
spectrum
perhaps
the
beer
is
just
an
overall
failure
the
guy
at
the
store
is
still
a
jerk
though
an
enjoyable
beer
from
jenlain
quite
sessionable
for
almost8
brilliant
clear
caramel
body
thin
white
head
earthy
grass
tree
bark
and
hoppy
notes
in
the
aroma
rich
caramel
malt
sits
atop
an
underlying
earthy
notes
simple
but
oh
so
good
smooth
full
bodied
but
still
very
refreshing
seems
like
a
big
earthy
easy
drinking
amber
not
like
any
biere
de
garde
i
have
sampled
i
loved
this
beer
this
aint
too
bad
just
avoid
the
blonde
at
all
costs
pours
a
lovely
clear
orangeish
colour
the
orange
is
so
strong
that
it
makes
the
head
looks
brownish
subtle
nose
of
toasted
malt
caramel
and
licorice
and
a
mild
but
agreeable
phenol
and
a
promise
of
complexity
which
it
delivers
in
a
strong
spicy
taste
and
aftertaste
surprisingly
strong
carbonation
in
the
mouth
agreeable
and
longlasting
aftertaste
full
coating
mouthfeel
light
carbonation
with
a
slight
alcohol
burn
in
the
finish
its
not
overwhelming
though
still
quite
drinkable
if
you
like
barlewines
go
for
it
but
this
misses
the
mark
in
terms
of
earthiness
and
must
and
dank
and
all
that
cobwebby
crap
that
i
love
in
the
style
poured
from
a
500ml

into
a

rising
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
with
a
small

that
dissipated
but
left
a
slight

aroma
was
malty
and
musty
there
was
a
dampness
to
the
smell
that
was
hard
to
place
very
slight
hint
of
dried
fruit
but
this
was
very
faint
flavor
was
bready
with
biscuit
notes
and
some
yeast
character
very
little
to
no
hop
presence
definitely
a
focus
on
the
malt
as
the
beer
warmed
there
seemed
to
be
some

warming
somewhat
revealing

with

it

with

three
fingers
of

head
receding
quickly
to
a
clingy

never

biscuity
malts
in
the
nose
sweet
with
notes
of
caramel
chocolate
molasses
a
light
fruitiness
earthy
hops
and
an
acidic
twang
it
has
a
complex
malt
flavor
that
is
nuttyearthy
with
caramel
and
lots
of
sweetness
spicy
and
floral
hops
cut
right
through
the
middle
contributing
little
bitterness
but
loads
of
flavor
there
is
also
a
touch
of
sourness
with
fruity
esters
that
lend
prunes
white
grapes
and
overripe
apples
it
has
low
carbonation
but
what
is
there
is
finebubbled
and
helps
the
beer
go
down
smoothly
lightly
tingly
dry
with
a
medium
malty
finish
there
is
an
interesting
drinkability
it
went
down
very
quickly
but
it
has
a
little
too
much
sweetness
for
prolonged
drinking
i
tried
this
one
fresh
in
france
and
it
was
pretty
different
tastes
like
it
has
aged
a
bit
but
has
done
so
gracefully
i
enjoyed
this
beer
very
much
its
complex
and
tasty
with
no
trace
of
the
alcohol
and
would
complement
almost
any
meal
nicely
definitely
worth
a
try
whether
fresh
or
lightlyaged
overall
quite
good
soft
drinkable
brew
d
good
75cl
bottle
dark
hazy

with
a
medium

the
foam
dissipates
to
a

leaving
some
nice
lacing
behind
no
sediment
smells
of
sweet
honeylike
malt
and
barnyard
yeast
along
with
some
citric
tang
slightly
earthy
towards
the
end
the
earthiness
becomes
much
stronger
on
the
taste
with
toasted
malts
really
taking
over
theres
a
distinct
lack
of
the
expected
funk
sweet
finish
though
a
hint
of
hop
bitterness
is
detectable
thick
feel
but
carbonation
is
a
bit
lacking
kind
of
disappointed
in
this
one
one
i
would
be
interested
in
having
again
enjoyable
beer
all
in
all
an
interesting
take
on
a
bière
de

that
almost
hints
at
an
english
barleywine
the
earthiness
is
there
the
french
and
the
funk
isnt
quite
what
i
was
anticipating
but
im
certainly
enjoying
this
one
as
i
sip
on
it

definitely
will
consider
revisiting
again
d

profile
from
my
angle
malty
characters
in

forefront
quite
drinkable
but
nothing
particularly
outstanding
d
definitely
different
seems
a
nice
take
on
a

never
had

worth
a

is

not

overall
this
is
okay
but
not
the
ultimate
belgian
beer
ive
been
searching
for
d
bit
too
spicy
for
my
pallet
but
a
good
creation
popped
the
cork
off
a
25oz
champagne
bottle
with
a
bottling
date
of
20092008
a
nice
pop
greeted
my

a
nice

a

settles

checking
out

this

beer
thanks
to
importation
a
well
crafted
beer
for

out

the

doesnt
come
off
as
much
in

but
it
is
there
there
is
also
more
of
a
nuttiness
and
a
toasty
punch
toward
the
finish
accompanied
by
some
more
pungent
herbal
hop
i
get
also
a

of
orange
in

little

works
well
to

some
of
this

it

there
but
not
overdone
at
all
its
just
a
touch
feel
is
good
the
right
level
of
bubble
on
the
tongue
and
a
smooth

experience
highly
drinkable
and
very
much
worth
trying
the
ambree
was
truly
excellent
with
thanksgiving
dinner
and
what
i
especially
appreciate
it
was
equally
good
with
the
main
course
and
the
dessert
it
paired
faultlessly
with
the
turkey
dressing
gravy
veggie
casseroles
and
sweet
potatoes
and
then
turned
around
and
sang
in
harmony
with
the
pumpkin
pie

and
apple
crisp

this
is
an
enjoyable
beer
wouldnt
make
it
a
regular
in
the
fridge
but
will
definitely
purchase
again
if
the
occasion
arises
oelergud
overall
a
beer
id
have
again
it
has
the
flavor
of
a
nightcap
beer
without
the
overwhelming
alcohol
effect
review
translated
from
french
5272008
no
idea
how
old
this
one
is
it
came
from
wine
world
in
penascola
several
months
ago
drinkability
i
could
be
blunt
and
caustic
here
but
hey
its
friday
d
fix
the
nose
and
this
was
a
very
enjoyable
beer
as
i
experienced
it
only
average
poured
out
of
a
750ml
corked
caged
bottle
the
color
is
a
redish
brown
with
plenty
of
suspended
yeast
floaters
the
head
was
very
dissappointing
no
lace
no
cap
the
smell
is
sugary
raisin
bread
and
honey
the
taste
is
of
raisin
bread
carob
sugary
with
a
bit
of
an
alcohol
burn
no
hops
detected
nothing
that
i
would
describe
as
earthy
to
help
counter
act
the
sweetness
the
feel
is
flat
and
slicky
almost
syrupy
the
smell
and
taste
arent
bad
but
this
sample
seems
to
be
old
and
flat
which
brings
out
the
sugary
characteristics
of
the
brew
drinkability
this
was
a
good
beer
and
that
was
with
a
cold
so
i
couldnt
get
the
best
experience
from
it
ooh
its
sweet
and
really
not
what
what
fits
my
criteria
for
farmhouse
ale
hoppy
flavors
and
plenty
of
fruitinessthe
sweet
red
kind
the
finish
boasts
some
more
sophisticated
hints
oak
or
vinousocity
poured
a
dense
coffee
froth
colored
head
that
fades
slowly
and
left
rings
of
lace
sweet
aroma
is
a
mix
of
caramel
wheat
and
lemon
grass
it
tastes
like
a
mix
of
caramel
and
spring
flowers
with
a
dash
of
lemon
zest
the
dont
exactly
blend
together
but
they
are
complimentary
towards
the
finish
a
mild
bitterness
and
a
dash
of
alcohol
kick
in
and
cut
the
sweetness
averagely
full
body
with
light
carbonation
makes
for
a
soft
beer
an
interesting
beer
that
was
well
worth
the
2
10
euro
i
paid
for
it
in
downtown
paris
its
appearance
was
pretty
good
with
an
amber
color
with
a
macrolooking
head
composed
of
tiny
uniformly
sized
bubbles
it
didnt
smell
like
anything
flavor
was
very
malty
sweet
and
a
bit
unpleasant
aromas
and
appearances
were
deceptively
misleading
as
this
beer
has
the
heart
of
a
brown
ale
creamy
mouthfeel
is
coupled
with
intense
nuttysweet
malts
indicative
of
the
best
brown
ales
finish
is
sweet
and
nutty
as
well
though
tempered
somewhat
by
a
touch
of
herbaceousness
to
balance
things
out
alcohol
is
masked
entirely
which
is
surprising
considering
its
strength
an
all
around
enjoyable
easy
to
drink
beer
taste
is
more
aggressive
than
the
smell
with
sweet
malts
taking
the
center
stage
they
get
toasty
towards
the
end
with
a
mild
biting
hop
character
tidying
things
up
sugared
fruits
and
spicy
yeast
accompany
this
one
on
its
way
mouthfeel
is
a
little
slick
and
sweet
but
is
nicely
carbonated
and
medium
bodied
fits
the
style
id
get
this
one
again
as
it
was
just
shy
over
4
50
for
the
750ml
this
is
a
simple
refreshing
and
smart
beer
with
an
understated
elegance
thats
easy
to
cozy
to
youve
heard
of
comfort
food
this
is
like
comfort
beer
gently
sweet
with
relaxed
properties
recommended
overall
nice
to
have
once
and
a
while
but
the
flavor
isnt
something
i
would
enjoy
many
others
within
the
style
that
i
prefer
had
a
bottle
at
boneyard
bistro
in
studio
city
the
appearance
was
a
muddy
red
with
very
little
head
what
head
there
was
disappeared
entirely
after
only
a
couple
of
minutes
the
aroma
was
nondescript
vaguely
malty
and
a
little
metallic
taste
was
better
offering
a
touch
of
plum
palate
was
nice
smooth
but
unremarkable
and
drinkability
was
in
the
ahhh
what
the
hell
category
not
bad
but
not
sure
if
ill
be
trying
it
again
an
ok
beer
but
not
one
i
would
visit
again
md
thinner
body
than
i
expected
but
not
bad
mouthfeel
nice
blend
and
balance
a
nice
french
ale
not
amazing
but
good
pours
a
clear
tawny
copper
brown
with
a
1
light
tan
head
with
good
retention
and
showy
belgian
lace
sweet
malts
and
belgium
cellarlike
musty
woodsy
aroma
that
almost
become
caramel
like
with
warming
little
evidence
of
hops
the
flavors
of
floral
spicey
contentental
hops
are
subdued
by
the
soft
water
profile
of
this
style
and
a
dominate
sweet
but
complex
maltyness
that
quickly
looses
the
sweetness
and
finishes
meddry
with
higher
alcohol
and
a
almost
balance
of
hop
ibus
medium
body
and
higher
carbonation
yield
a
creamy
mouthfel
with
some
warmth
from
alcohols
otherwise
well
hidden
by
the
malts
viennamunich
blended
with
pale
and
possibly
some
crystal
type
malts
an
extended
lagering
of
the
artisanal
farmhouse
ales
helps
produce
this
fairly
strong
malty
character
as
the
lighter
hopping
fades
with
longer
aginging
fermented
on
the
lower
range
of
yeast
temperatures
makes
this
a
great
entry
level
to
the
higher
abv
belgian
styles
imho
more
fit
for
winter
season
than
bier
de
mars
a
similar
style
taste
is
sweet
and
doused
in
alcohol
with
spices
and
surprising
heft
to
the
mouthfeel
aftertaste
leaves
you
wanting
more
although
there
isnt
one
thing
in
the
flavor
that
really
hits
me
as
being
outstanding
a
solid
pick
up
if
looking
for
a
starter
belgian
before
going
in
for
the
heavy
duty
stuff
bb

some

not
bad
at
all
though
but
again
like
other
duyck
beers
quiet
decent

low
dosed
taste
is
quiet
alcoholic
but
has
some
caramel
malts
aswel
as
decent
bitterness
in
aftertaste
alcohol
quiet
dominant
though
witch
is
also
making
mouthfeel
unbalanced
and
fuelled
low
carbonisation
also
not
really
fitting
brew
drinkable
beer
pretty
tasty
stuff
would
like
it
better
with
a
little
more
carbonation
overall
this
beer
is
decent
not
something
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
for
i
dont
have
a
whole
lot
else
to
say
about
jenlain
french
farmhouse
ale
it
isnt
true
to
the
stated
style
and
isnt
even
that
good
regardless
of
style
i
know
that
the
french
are
capable
of
brewing
great
saisons
and
bieres
de
garde
because
ive
tasted
them
this
one
isnt
anywhere
close
to
proving
that
statement
correct
decent
amber
color
white
head
trace
amounts
of
lacing
slightly
sour
green
apples
cherries
and
maybe
even
some
strawberry
taste
is
of
nice
sweet
caramel
with
some
very
subtle
fruit
undertones
higher
carbonation
heavier
side
of
medium
bodied
pretty
good
beer
i
dont
know
that
id
get
this
often
but
im
sure
there
are
plenty
of
occasions
in
which
it
would
work
quite
well
moderate
mouth
with
just
enough
carbonation
i
would
like
to
try
this
again
and
see
what
it
pairs
best
with
recommended
for
a
time
when
you
just
want
something
tasty
not
too
complex
especially
if
you
want
a
break
from
hop
monsters
mouth
cool
mouthfeel
with
a
lightly
fizzy
and
stinging
carbonation
flavors
of
hay
toffee
earthy
minerals
sweet
up
front
and
more
sour
in
the
back
and
aftertaste
a
warm
alcohol
exhale
and
no
hop
bitterness
funny
i
had
this
on
thanksgiving
and
i
dont
remember
it
being
anything
like
this
malty
dry
and
earthy
easy
drinking
though
the
notion
of
alcohol
finishes
each
sip
definately
something
to
pair
with
a
meal
its
good
enough
to
try
later
but
not
enough
to
freak
out
and
look
for
the
freshest
bottle
possible
but
if
by
chance
i
find
it
it
may
be
mine
this
would
be
a
good
summer
ale
with
a
picnic
and
some
air
this
is
probably
one
that
is
much
better
whenst
paired
with
food
as
a
stand
alone
beer
this
doesnt
work
too
well
for
me

but
seems
more

than
it
actually
is
im

i
like
it
but
i
dont
worth
a
try

the

its

instead

rather

at

for

overall
an

very

recommended
high
in
drinkability
due
to
the
lightness
of
the
body
and
the
good
flavor
i
just
wish
it
were
heavier
d
this
beer
has
interesting
qualities
that
remind
me
of
a
really
good
fresh
kolsch
but
it
also
has
some
more
depth
and
complexity
in
the
malt
i
guess
there
is
a
faint
cellar
taste
that
sets
it
off
but
it
is
not
really
a
distinct
flavor
this
beer
should
be
commended
on
its
combination
of
lean
body
with
an
abundance
of
complexity
and
flavornot
an
easy
feat
this
is
a
bit
leaner
bodied
and
less
sweet
than
some
of
the
other
biere
de
garde
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
drinking
while
i
my
own
malt
cravings
would
prefer
a
bit
more
malty
sweetness
in
this
one
its
leaner
body
makes
it
refreshing
and
an
excellent
accompaniment
to
a
meal
overall
worth
a
shot
if
you
can
find
it
poured
a
brilliant
amberorange
hue
with
a
foamy
head
that
collapsed
quickly
the
aroma
was
that
of
sweet
malt
with
notes
of
oak
chardonnay
and
cider
the
beer
had
a
mediumheavy
mouthfeel
and
the
maltiness
was
reasonably
sweet
along
the
lines
of
a
marzen
after
the
main
malt
rush
comes
some
nuttiness
with
a
slight
alcohol
warmth
the
noble
hops
help
balance
things
out
but
definitely
take
a
back
seat
to
the
sweet
malts
used
the
carbonation
was
fine
and
tight
rich
in
flavor
but
very
drinkable
my
first
beer
of
my
trip
to
beer
hell
rural
southern
france
and
also
my
first
biere
de
garde
surprisingly
this
readily
available
treat
isnt
half
bad
still
its
nothing
to
write
home
about
rich
amber
color
on
the
orange
side
thin
white
head
that
disappears
immediately
relatively
bland
sweetish
with
light
caramel
malts
silky
little
to
no
hops
are
found
in
this
there
is
a
faint
odor
of
fermented
fruits
nothing
particularly
special
going
on
here
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
and
i
would
say
it
is
very
drinkable
pours
a
crystal
clear
dark

with
a
finger
of

is

taste
continues
with

grassy
and
overripe
apple
juice
notes
above
a
caramel
malt
base
mouthfeel
is
clean
amd
crisp
but
overall
lacking
this
beer
reminded
me
of
vikings
honey
moon
braggot
which
i
couldnt
finish
i
was
able
to
finish
this
one
but
it
didnt
quite
sit
well
with
me
it
was
refreshing
but
not
tasty
enough
for
me
to
want
another
id
like
to
see
what
some
other
biere
de
gardes
taste
like
before
i
write
the
style
off
however
taste
low
carbonation
that
gives
the
malt
all
the
room
to
shine
the
yeast
isnt
the
cleanest
but
but
its
mellow
and
with
that
subdued
corky
flavor
a
bit
more
and
i
wouldnt
have
liked
it
it
reminds
me
more
of
an
old
ale
one
with
a
little
extra
spice
but
aged
to
perfection
excellent
example
of
a
style
i
didnt
think
i
liked
d
this
is
a
great
beer
great
to
sip
after
dinner
while
unwinding
full
rich
mouthfeel
with
supple
carbonation

bottles

your

make

sip

an

flavor
is
sweet
with
some

and
then
caramel
again
some
biscuity
yeast
comes
through
and
a
faint
white
grape
presence
as
well
the
finish
is
tasty
and
clean
i
expected
a
little
less
structure
to
thebeer
with
more
funk
and
off
beat
flavors
but
i
still
did
enjoy
the
beer
this
grew
on
me
as
i
went
at
first
it
seemed
just
fine
but
added
a
bit
more
interest
as
it
went
along
perhaps
not
enough
to
push
my
numbers
higher
but
worthy
of
giving
it
a
solid
rating
and
recommending
it
to
myself
to
perhaps
grab
again
sometime
330
ml
bottle
this
beer
pours
out
a
reddish
brown
color
with
a
huge
head
aroma
of
malt
and
herbs
thick
malt
flavor
with
sugar
a
little
bit
of
metal
taste
i
kept
expecting
the
flavor
to
become
a
little
sour
or
tart
but
it
never
did
sweet
all
the
way
through
some
grassy
herbal
flavors
hops
are
mild
good
drinkability
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
i
never
really
got
into
it
im
not
blown
away
by
this
beer
but
i
am
still
firmly
impressed
as
drinking
goes
this
goes
down
with
the
best
of
them
maybe
a
bit
shy
overall
but
pounds
it
out
nonetheless
this
beer
is
so
underrated
amber
color
nice
head
nice
lacejust
a
fabulous
unique
beer
this
is
your
thanksgiving
beer
as
i
could
see
it
pairing
perfectly
w
turkey
stuffing
crannberry
etc
smell
is
so
subtle
and
mild
there
is
some
woody
elements
going
onthis
is
a
nice
beer
just
take
my
advice
and
buy
this
shit
if
you
have
the
opportunity
another
great
belgian
french
beer
its
got
a
dark
yellow
golden
color
a
bit
hazed
with
a
champaign
like
head
and
carbonation
aromas
of
wine
musk
grapes
pears
apples
and
earthyness
mild
sweetness
of
honey
combined
with
tart
lactic
acids
create
crispness
and
complexity
not
as
musky
earthy
or
pungent
as
some
other
biere
de
gardes
lighter
notes
make
this
beer
a
better
drinker
finishes
dry
tart
and
crisp
light
alcohol
is
woven
into
the
tartness
and
fades
nicely
tasted

there
are
better
biere

but
once
this
is
in
my
mouth
i
find
it
hard
to
complain
about
a
lack
of
transcendence
in
my
glass
nice
beer
nuff
said
pours
a
clear
but
quite
bubbly
gold
under
a
one

snow
white
head
that
lingers
for
a
bit
before
settling
to

and
collar
only
a
couple
drops
of
lace
cling
to
the

sweet
fruity
nose
very
strong
of
spice
and
raspberry
the
mouth
is
very
light
with
subdued
carbonation
very
sweet
taste
with
light
fruit
dominating
the
spice
is
also
sweet
adding
to
the
natural
sweetness
of
the
wheat
no
noticeable
hops
the
finish
is
sugary
while
the
aftertaste
reminds
a
bit
of
a
raspberry
frozen
popsicle
not
for
me
thanks
fine
beer
nice
way
to
end
a
week
my
first
biere
de
garde
methinks
i
need
more
creamy
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
goes
down
smooth
a
tasty
brew
overall
but
its
not
something
id
drink
regularly
nice
for
a
change
of
pace
the
sweetness
gets
to
be
a
bit
much
by
the
end
of
the
bottle
the
malts
used
for
this
biere
de
garde
lend
a
sweet
taste
and
the
finish
lingers
with
a
bit
of
caramel
flavor
drinkability
is
good
im
not
overwhelmed
in
the
abv
area
or
with
palette
destroying
flavors
ill
try
this
with
food
next
time
to
see
how
it
works
a
coppery
red
to
orange
caste
to
this
biere
de
garde
the
aromas
are
of
fruit
tea
raspberry
liquerish
not
licorice
with
a
hint
of
an
herbal
hops
prescence
the
taste
is
smooth
buttery
malt
with
the
aforementioned
fruit
character
and
a
nice
balance
between
the
malt
and
the
hops
a
dry
finish
very
satisfying
great
with
just
about
any
meal
i
can
think
of
this
is
not
far
from
the
beer
mainstream
yet
it
has
more
character
and
durability
than
bona
fide
mainstream
styles
that
saturate
the
market
not
cerebral
get
some
to
enjoy
with
plates
of

a

spread
across
the

aroma
is
spicey
verging
on
metallic
and
with
ample
citrus
qualities
medium
body
less
carbonation
than
in
some
biere

begins
malty
biscuity
and
sugary
lemon
bars
with
powdered
sugar
frosting
some
sweet
apple
pie
makes
a
nod
toward
drying
mid
mouth
and
finishes
with
some
yeasty
tones
and
a
very
subtle
hop
could
tighten
up
even
more
for
me
the
aroma
had
me
thinking
a
dryer
finish
was
in
store
still
this
is
a
creamy
and
quaffable
brew
a
smooth
easy
drink
strongly
carbonated
refreshing
like
an
amber
with
a
purposeful
off

it
works
good
thing
volo
caffe
held
on
to
an
lcbo
bottle
from
a
couple
years
back
although
i
think
that
took
away
from
aroma
received
this
in
a
10
pack
beers
of
the
world
gift
pack
so
i
had
no
real
expectations
when
trying
this
one
out
noticed
a
good
review
in
michale
jacksons
beer
guide
and
feel
not
too
far
off
enjoy
the
vanilla
smell
and
after
taste
hard
to
judge
its
appearance
since
im
not
sure
what
a
biere
de
garde
is
but
it
poured
a
nice
head
and
solid
lacing
color
of
a
copper
unfiltered
wheat
will
not
seek
this
out
specifically
but
its
worth
a
try
ill
look
for
it
at
my
regular
store
and
sample
it
again
simple
but
impactful
flavors
begin
with
some
honeyish
malts
and
doughy
feel
this
is
a
total
conversion
beer
its
got
some
luxurious
qualities
to
it
with
a
slightly
spicy
midpalate
but
this
is
driven
by
crisp
simple
taste
12oz
bottle
stamped
with
a
bestby
date
of
032005
poured
into
my
duvel
tulip
a
dark
amber
hue
with
a
nice
frothy
1inch
head
good
carbonation
aroma
of
belgian
yeast
sweet
malt
and
light
fruit
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
sturdy
not
too
thick
not
too
thin
palate
is
very
fruity
with
essence
of
peach
and
grapes
sweet
malt
and
light
floral
hops
yeastiness
comes
through
towards
the
back
of
the
mouth
along
with
a
bready
character
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
is
a
bit
unpleasant
and
keeps
this
from
being
a
more
drinkable
beer
thanks
to
merlin48
for
bringing
this
beer
my
way
it
pours
a
light
amber
color
with
a
small
head
that
dies
off
fast
and
doesnt
leave
much
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
reminescent
of
hay
with
some
malts
and
a
little
hop
the
flavor
reminds
me
of
a
farm
a
bit
caramel
flavor
with
a
bit
of
hay
and
dirt
not
bad
just
not
my
style
this
beer
comes
to
my
lips
through
two
bas
thanks
to
merlin48
for
sharing
this
with
clvand0
who
is
sharing
it
with
me
the
beer
pours
a
amber
golden
color
with
a
finger
of
head
that
falls
to
coat
the
beer
the
nose
is
lemony
with
a
touch
of
biscuit
in
there
i
think
the
flavor
is
odd
i
get
some
biscuit
maly
somce
lemony
tartness
and
a
decent
bitter
on
the
finish
i
dont
know
about
this
one
its
not
bad
but
its
weird
the
feel
is
light
to
moderate
with
a
nice
carbonation
on
it
drinkability
sufferes
from
the
flavor
that
i
just
dont
like
all
that
much
dont
get
me
wrony
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
but
its
not
something
i
would
have
again
a
clean
effervesent
dark
amber
ale
with
a
foamy
off
white
head
a
slightly
sweet
malt
aroma
with
a
very
strong
sour
apple
and
cinnamon
presence
the
light
malt
sweetness
starts
out
the
taste
followed
quickly
by
aburst
of
carbonation
that
brings
an
appley
flavor
along
with
it
and
a
spicey
hop
finish
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
of
a
style
that
is
not
easy
to
come
by
in
my
area
easy
drinking
and
a
nice
change
of
pace
really
crisp
i
like
the
style
its
refreshingly
different
light
and
mild
overall
and
the
floral
hopping
combines
with
the
malt
presence
very
well
drinkability
is
a
bit
harder
for
me
to
quantify
its
a
fine
beer
but
ive
only
had
half
of
it
and
feel
like
ive
been
hit
by
a
tractor
driven
by
jose
bove
on
his
way
to
tear
down
another
mcdonalds
sacre
bleu
obviously
this
is
a
very
rich
beer
i
would
highly
recommend
this
as
an
alternative
to
dessert
this
could
be
featured
as
an
apertif
flavor
follows
with
a
little
bit
of
a
cork
to
the
mushrooms
coated
in
caramel
finish
has
spiced
sour
apple
finish
cork
popped
rather
easily
off
of
this
750
but
thankfully
there
was
nol
rush
of
beer
poured
a
nice
coppper
color
with
a
quickly
dissapating
white
head
smell
was
delicate
and
floral
taste
is
full
of
subtlities
slightly
sweet
and
mayber
pepper
i
dont
know
if
my
mind
is
playing
tricks
on
me
a
lot
of
malt
is
present
though
which
grows
stronger
as
it
warms
pretty
drinkable
in
my
book
a
nice
treat
every
once
and
awhile
its
perhaps
not
the
most
intricate
biere
de
garde
but
its
fully
realized
cohesive
and
delicious
just
a
joy
the
head
was
thin
but
dense
and
creamy
on
an
orange
mahogany
color
body
the
smell
was
mostly
malty
but
overall
kind
of
weak
the
taste
was
more
interesting
although
not
exceptional
some
fruity
notes
of
citrus
and
of
red
fruits
are
combined
with
a
deep
malty
character
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
round
but
not
overly
complex
or
thick
not
sure
i
want
to
drink
that
again
i
just
had
a
cookie
and
i
liked
the
cookie
better
750
ml
bottle
corked
and
bailed
very
refreshing
and
easy
drinking
beer
imho
a
fair
brew
with
a
nice
mouthfeel
but
not
a
lot
of
memorable
qualities
pours
a
rich
copper
with
a
nice
two
finger
head
that
settles
nicelyaroma
is
definently
spicey
all
malt
and
sweet
caramel
with
a
touch
of
bread
very
firm
malt
taste
to
this
beer
lightly
sweet
with
a
vegetable
flavor
that
lingers
in
the
mouthi
get
a
light
burnt
note
as
i
drink
more
along
with
some
over
ripe
melon
a
rich
and
tasty
brew
that
iam
sure
goes
well
with
hearty
fare
this
was
a
very
pleasant
very
mellow
dry
and
a
very
flavorful
and
traditional
biere

farmhouse
characteristics
burnt
caramel
toasted
malts
ripe
fruits
perhaps
a
hint
of
ginger
and
a
lingering
suggestion
of
pit
fruit
on
the
finish
lovely
this
beer
poured
a
reddish
amber
color
and
formed
a
samll
foamy
off
white
head
that
left
circular
lace
as
it
subsided
a
small
amount
of
carbonation
is
present
an
aroma
of
light
citrus
and
grass
a
flavor
of
malt
slight
bit
of
cherry
almost
a
medicinal
quality
to
it
the
finish
was
sweet
and
also
had
a
slight
medincinal
aspect
to
it
pretty
good
beer
for
the
price
500ml
can
this
one
is
an
amber
color
the
beer
is
a
bit
fizzy
with
a
slightly
off
white
head
but
it
dies
down
quickly
the
aroma
is
mild
but
somewhat
caramel
malty
sweet
the
taste
is
better
than
the
aroma
there
is
a
medium
bodied
caramel
sweetness
to
the
taste
but
also
a
fairl
amount
of
complexity
some
nuttiness
fruitiness
with
a
hint
of
spices
and
hops
flavor
could
be
a
bit
stronger
really
excellent
for
a
can
beer
murky
looking
brown
with
an
orangish
tint
to
it
thin

a
750
for

yeah
id
be
buying
a
hell
of
a
lot
more
of
this
if
it
was
available
in
this
area
this
is
not
something
that
i
could
drink
all
the
time
but
it
does
go
well
with
some
stinky
french
cheeses
and
a
nice
crusty
baguette
it
is
a
cloudy
amber
and
a
decent
sized
head
the
aroma
has
some
orange
and
prune
notes
the
oily
body
finishes
slight
spicy
with
notes
of
anise
the
best
beer
ive
had
in
france
so
far
and
i
was
beginning
to
give
up
hope
looking
forward
to
trying
brasserie
duycks
blonde
also
a
fine
introduction
to
the
bière
de
garde
style
big
soft
round
juicy
on
the

prickly
carbonation
my
beer
of
choice
this
year
at
thanksgiving
dinner
750
ml
bottle
poured
an
unfiltered
mediumtodark
amber
with
a
large
head
that
remained
throughout
most
of
comsumption
musty
malty
aroma
i
almost
wonder
how
long
this
bottle
has
been
sitting
around
on
the
store
shelf
as
it
was
the
dusty
sole
remaining
one
very
musty
flavor
reminds
me
of
a
cellar
or
basement
some
sweet
stale
fruitiness
malt
is
hard
to
detect
hops
are
mininal
at
best
spicy
or
peppery
alcohol
near
the
back
of
the
throat
not
a
beer
i
was
opposed
to
it
went
pretty
well
with
dinner
but
i
think
its
an
acquired
taste
id
like
to
seek
out
another
bottle
hopefully
fresher
if
this
one
was
decrepit
and
give
it
another
shot
lovely
rich
amber
colour
with
a
small
offwhite
head
very
fruity
aroma
with
hints
of
cinnamon
absolutely
incredible
tasting
beer
very
fruity
with
hints
of
peaches
and
other
stone
fruit
very
soft
in
the
mouth
a
party
for
the
palate
a
beatifull
beer
to
reserve
for
special
occasions
but
i
could
probably
only
drink
one
or
two
at
a
time
would
go
great
with
fruit
or
strong
cheese
very
food
friendly
an
amber
colored
ale
that
pours
with
a
flourish
of
a
foam
that
settles
to
thin
veneer
of
bubbles
the
aroma
of
toffee
nuts
fruit
and
sugar
combined
with
a
faint
mustiness
bursts
from
the
glass
and
then
fades
but
is
still
noticeable
after
a
few
minutes
this
beer
is
soft
malty
then
fruity
with
sugary
notes
finishes
slightly
dry
yet
a
bit
slippery
with
a
tartness
that
tickles
the
side
of
the
mouth
a
medium
bodied
ale
with
a
soft
mouthfeel
but
slighty
rough
carbonation
theres
some
unsual
fruity
flavors
towards
the
finish
that
are
very
interesting
i
like
this
beer
especially
at
2
99
a
750ml
bottle
a
very
enjoyable
peculiar
beer
based
on
what
i
know
about
the
style
this
a
very
good
biere
de
garde
ooooh
if
it
were
not
for
my
cheapness
i
wouldnt
have
bought
this
bottle
of
75cls
of
a
medium
beer
nor
in
terms
of
taste
nor
looks
nor
actual
overall
desirability
is
this
beer
going
on
anyones
top
list
just
because
a
thing
has
an
uncommon
name
doesnt
necessarily
put
it
within
the
interest
this
is
a
one
timer
boo
pours
with
a
medium
head
leaving
some
lace
nice
amber
color
malty
citrus
orange
nose
starts
sweet
and
fruity
and
finishes
with
some
tartness
and
underlying
hops
medium
bodied
very
different
for
a
french
beer
served
at
passports
in
glouster
ma
4
75
as
a
side
note
the
cork
appears
to
have
some
mold
on
it
stored
upright
and
i
dont
think
it
affected
the
taste
i
dont
know
what
this
stuff
tastes
like
normally
but
my
bottle
was
mega
old
and
way
past
its
prime
the
beer
poured
a
greasy
looking
amber

and
the
beer
was
just
sour
and
old
i
always
have
to
take
a
sip
just
to
be
sure
its
not
totally
unpalatable
i
imagine
this
stuff
is
pretty
good
when
fresh
and
i
plan
on
buying
it
and
rerating
it
just
beware
because
it
certainly
doesnt
age
well
i
hate
liquor

that
dont

i
enjoyed
the
hell
out
of
this
i
didnt
know
what
to
expect
from
france
but
i
was
very
pleased
with
the
offering
i
enjoyed
this
french
biere
de
garde
very
much
it
is
distinct
from
its
belgian
cousins
but
very
drinkable
orangetinted
golden
colour
very
light
chill
haze
the
head
is
quite
small
and
drops
to
a
thin
ring
and
covering
layer
still
its
quite
appealing
aroma
hints
at
the
flavours
to
come
a
couple
phenols
some
citrus
maybe
a
slight
mustiness
the
flavours
themselves
theres
a
sour
hint
to
the
beginning
followed
by
sweetness
hints
of
lemon
hops
fade
in
and
out
a
dry
finish
leaving
the
throat
crying
out
for
more
a
very
respectable
beer
theres
pleasant
flavours
nothing
is
out
of
proportion
and
everything
is
restrained
in
a
wonderful
understated
harmony
notes

beefy
french

treat
this
one
with
respect
and
bring
it
along
on
a
picnic
with
assorted
cheeses
beer
bread
and
fruit
more
of
a
treat
yourself
beer
or
something
to
toast
with
other
than
champagne
obviously
complex
and
sophisticated
to
say
the
least
486
imho
biere
de
garde
is
made
to
have
with
food
especially
comfort
foods
so
much
more
of
the
complexity
of
this
beer
is
brought
out
by
food
than
by
drinking
alone
this
is
meatloaf
and
beef
or
chicken
stew
beer
not
impressed
colour
is
nice
deep
golden
honey
with
very
limited
head
taste
tho
is
lacking
as
it
quickly
departs
and
leaves
no
memories
is
kinda
like
a
full
bodied
water
maybe
an
aquired
taste
a
classic
biére
de
garde
flavourful
refreshing
and
impressive
when
unleashed
on
your
nonbeer
drinking
friends
comes
in
a
750ml
corked
and
crowned
green
bottle
nice
pairing
for
nearly
any
food
type
very
drinkable
biere
de
garde
not
as
complex
as
say
3
monts
but
very
pleasurable
drink
spicy
light
to
medium
body
hints
of
caramel
but
maybe
a
bit
sweet
at
the
start
decent
i
agree
with
jasons
review
but
found
it
a
little
too
sweet
tasting
for
my
liking
had
this
in
a
11
2
oz
bottle
do
not
like
will
not
drink
no
construct
proper
sentences
rjt
o
good
drinkability
good
beer
not
my
favourite
to
be
honest
it
is
a
mix
of
a
tripel
sour
and
a
bit
of
belgian
ipa
worth
a
try
not
sure
i
would
have
this
again
bottom
line
i
probably
wouldnt
get
this
again
because
there
are
better
beers
for
the
price
but
i
would
get
it
again
for
about
5
per
750ml
nothing
really
special
about
it
o
i
remember
drinking
this
beer
way
back
in
the
mid1990s
when
this
was
a
very
interesting
beer
but
unfortunately
it
did
not
stand
the
test
of
time
for
me
the
industry
has
moved
on
but
these
guys
have
not
changed
in
the
least
a
fine
beer
and
definitely
in
the
belgian
blonde
wheelhouse
i
could
drink
more
of
this
main
complaint
is
the
lack
of
carbonation
i
see
its
listed
here
as
a
biere
de
garde
but
thats
not
how
it
strikes
me
all
in
all
not
bad
for
being
teen
years
old

overall
drinkability
very
very
very
drinkable
beer
i
wish
i
had
another
or
two
of
these
which
makes
them
quite
dangerous
at

abv
smooth
simple
tasty
went
fantastic
with
fettuccine
alfredo
and
i
believe
this
would
be
great
with
a
lot
of
other
meals
as
well
fantastic
beer
notes
not
impressed
d
a
decent
example
of
the
style
but
things
didnt
cohere
through
the
course
of
the
beer
a
bit
overpriced
will
not
revisit
mouthfeel
is
creamy
smooth
with
light
carbonation
a
medium
body
and
a
light
feel
a
real
nice
beer
that
went
down
easy
and
would
be
a
good
session
beer
not
the
most
complex
beer
but
very
drinkable
o
i
really
wasnt
a
fan
of
this
beer
the
metallic
aroma
and
flavor
destroyed
this
beer
for
me
theres
hints
of
something
really
nice
to
the
beer
the
good
green
apple
skin
qualities
but
its
all
wiped
clean
by
the
metal
this
blonde
is
a
bit
sweeter
and
bit
richer
in
body
than
i
expected
and
its
a
fairly
potent
brew
for
the
style
but
overall
a
nice
easytogulp
brew
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
brew
was
the
surprising
inclusions
throughout
the
taste
after
a
somewhat
questionable
aroma
the
beer
delivered
to
the
tongue
some
esters
and
phenols
which
were
totally
unexpected
there
was
some
nice
blending
throughout
and
even
some
hop
on
the
finish
giving
this
brew
a
little
rejuvenation
clear
amber
color
nose
a
little
white
wine
one
feels
indeed
raisins
with
light
winds
of
tannins
probably
due
to
the
cork
entry
into
mouth
a
little
acid
but
the
drink
quickly
became
silky
mouth
rounded
and
has
good
hops
and
usually
cereals
fairly
well
controlled
the
finish
reproduces
the
hops
with
a
lemony
side
to
provide
a
good
aftertaste
for
beeing
a
light
lager
this
blondie
is
not
pale
at
all
first
i
thought
the
smell
was
unusal
and
confusing
but
the
strong
elements
of
citrus
and
herbs
from
north
france
are
actually
very
tasty
after
drinking
the
beer
at
several
times
you
will
learn
how
to
love
it
jenlain
has
more
of
an
attitude
of
an
amber
redhead
blonde
with
special
elements
of
honey
and
apricot
notes
nice
colour
crispy
at
first
served
at
8
degrees
it
tends
to
feel
more
creamy
and
has
the
foam
that
goes
well
with
food
warmer
jenlain
has
a
full
body
taste
and
is
something
of
a
springbeer
jenlain
blonde
is
also
more
worth
while
for
the
female
tongue
dont
ask
me
why
ask
your
girlfriends
and
remember
thatjenlain
is
indeed
french
you
hated
piaf
at
first
too
gave
her
bad
reviews
you
did
not
see
the
splendor
the
rest
is
history
drinkability
this
is
my
first
beer
of
this
style
and
i
rather
liked
it
it
seemed
a
bit
too
heavy
on
sweetness
and
a
lack
of
balance
prevents
it
from
being
great
still
a
good
beer
and
one
i
wouldnt
mind
having
again
ill
definitely
try
to
find
more
brews
of
this
style
in
the
future
overall
a
solid
beer
not
a
bad
taste
though
its
malty
in
the
center
some
spice
all
around
and
a
semistrong
crisp
snap
i
dont
the
anise
that
i
tend
to
expect
from
bdgs
its
a
good
beer
easy
drinking
but
i
think
the
blond
style
gives
it
a
bit
of
lighter
touch
d
a
high
amount
of
sweetness
reduces
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
the
next
time
i
have
this
i
would
try
pair
it
with
dinner
drinkable
nice
example
of
style
not
the
best
belgian
blonde
i
have
had
but
certainly
not
the
worst
either
would
make
a
decent
gateway
beer
for
a
beginner
drinkability
way
more
drinkable
than
the
one
bottle
i
got
from
who
knows
where
if
i
find
more
im
getting
it
im
somewhat
shocked
by
the
lower
ratings
it
has
received
poured
into
snifter
pours
a
hazy
brownishorange
a
little
head
and
some
lacing
good
retention
smell
is
a
bit
tart
some
sweet
malt
and
grain
too
taste
of
sweet
malt
slightly
caramelish
with
some
fruit
mainly
the
sweetness
mouthfeel
was
a
little
fuller
than
light
if
that
makes
sense
and
smooth
overall
a
good
beer
just
not
quite
there
i
do
have
to
say
the
abv
was
masked
very
well
typical
of
the
style
there
is
some
mouth
to
the
brew
and
it
lingers
in
the
finish
with
a
malty
slightly
alcoholic
note
overall
this
was
a
bit
disappointing
as
im
a
big
fan
of
the
biere
de
garde
style
which
i
think
is
a
very
underrated
style
i
probably
wont
reach
for
this
one
again
without
lack
of
a
better
alternative
but
i
would
like
to
compare
it
to
some
of
jenlains
other
offerings
not
a
beer
which
id
go
back
to
it
was
too
sweet
to
be
enjoyable
there
are
plenty
of
better
options
in
this
style
to
spend
your
money
on
dthis
is
a
tasty
little
beer
with
a
fair
bit
of
character
the
off
flavor
makes
this
one
less
drinkable
for
me
blech
3monts
was
so
much
better
the
pour
was
a
light
amber
color
with
a
two
finger
white
head
the
nose
is
faint
but
it
was
bready
malty
with
notes
of
yeast
a
full
body
creamy
beer
with
a
bready
malty
taste
hints
of
caramel
and
nuts
the
finish
was
slightly
sweet
and
very
clean
overall
an
okay
beer
but
it
has
a
price
tag
d
not
a
bad
drinker
definitely
a
beer
to
be
shared
and
paired
with
something
bold
that
complements
its
sweetness
a
spicy
dish
strikes
me
as
ideal
like
mexican
or
indian
this
beer
started
out
with
some
promise
but
alas
no
it
pours
a
golden
orange
color
with
a
decent
creamy
slightly
efforvescent
head
a
bit
of
lacing
too
the
aroma
right
out
of
the
bottle
was
definitely
a
bit
musty
but
that
mellowed
to
a
sweet
maltiness
and
some
fairly
typical
belgian
yeasty
floral
notes
are
coming
through
the
taste
is
quite
off
there
is
a
bite
to
this
beer
that
is
not
good
although
there
are
some
of
the
clove
type
hints
a
big
palate
and
belgian
type
yeasty
floral
sweetness
but
this
is
all
terribly
compromised
by
a
finish
that
is
not
good
there
is
a
cheapness
to
the
finish
that
detracts
substantially
from
what
could
have
been
a
decent
beglian
blonde
the
finish
is
a
bit
perfume
like
in
its
bite
and
it
just
lasts
and
lasts
this
one
is
going
down
the
drain
its
unfortunate
not
bad
i
actually
kinda
dig
this
one
its
far
from
a
great
beer
but
i
think
i
like
it
its
really
like
a
euro
macro
lager
brewers
version
of
a
belgian
pale
ale
kinda
cool
this
was
a
very
satisfying
refreshing
brew
it
could
maybe
be
just
a
touch
drier
and
not
quite
as
sweet
but
still
a
very
tasty
beer
the
taste
is
candied
oranges
up
front
and
relatively
ends
on
a
sweet
note
pours
a
clear
amber
with
a
nice
sized
crème
head
nose
is
nutty
and
woody
flavor
is
smooth
with
a
slight
woody
tone
to
it
touch
of
sweetness
there
but
not
overdone
at
all
its
just
a
touch
feel
is
good
the
right
level
of
bubble
on
the
tongue
and
a
smooth
liquid
experience
highly
drinkable
and
very
much
worth
trying
pours
out
a
chillhazed
blonde
with
lively
bubbles
and
a
frothy
decent
sized
head
leaves
some
sheets
of
lace
smell
is
a
mix
of
honey
fresh
baked
bread
stone
fruits
and
floral
hops
has
an
interesting
cedarlike
mustiness
to
it
that
is
just
great
flavor
leans
toward
a
sweet
and
jasminelike
flavor
with
hints
of
white
raisins
mint
and
passion
fruit
bready
and
overall
nice
feels
rather
soft
in
the
mouth
and
has
a
solid
lowtomedium
weight
nice
drinker
and
reminds
me
of
a
mix
of
a
pilsner
and
a
blonde
ale
with
a
lot
of
interesting
complexities
pours
a
clear
gold
with
moderate
head
development
that
settles
fairly
quickly
smell
is
sweet
and
malty
with
a
faint
underlying
skunkiness
peppery
spiciness
to
the
aroma
taste
is
sweet
with
a
nectarlike
quality
mouthfeel
is
a
little
on
the
sticky
side
carbonation
is
adequate
and
finish
is
dry
overall
this
is
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
fairly
average
but
definitely
worth
drinking
drinkability
was
pretty
high
for
me
as
i
really
enjoyed
it
and
it
went
down
quite
easily
ive
got
a
penchant
for
the
more
sugary
beers
though
so
i
can
see
how
some
might
not
care
for
it
still
with
only
two
glasses
im
not
sure
how
easily
id
be
able
to
suck
down
another
bottle
or
two
my
favorite
style
and
a
pretty
nice
example
my
biggest
complaint
would
be
the
slight
metallic
tang
evident
in
both
in
both
the
aroma
and
taste
also
best
served
cold
to
keep
it
clean
and
light
drinkability
would
go
really
well
with
almond
encrusted
halibut
wish
i
had
some
now
drinkability
not
bad
a
good
every
once
in
a
while
beer
note
theres
a
stamp
on
the
label
that
says
092005
so
this
sample
is
pretty
darned
old
but
it
was
still
a
tasty
brew
id
like
to
try
a
fresher
one
for
sure
i
was
hoping
to
be
able
to
say
wonderful
things
about
this
beer
but
sadly
it
didnt
live
up
to
my
expectations
a
good
beer
that
i
was
expecting
to
be
great
a
very
nice
easy
drinking
beer
thanks
to
stephen
for
finding
this
rare
example
this
is
an
enjoyable
beer
but
a
little
too
strong
for
sipping
on
a
hot
summer
day
like
today
id
probably
enjoy
this
more
in
the
early
spring
or
late
fall
poured
a
light
soft
yellow
amber
with
a
thin
white
head
and
no
real
lace
or
retention
smell
was
light
and
fruity
apricot
figs
and
a
grainy
aroma
mixed
in
with
a
nice
light
body
first
impression
was
very
nice
on
a
warm
night
lots
of
body
a
little
slack
on
the
carbonation
but
not
slick
or
oily
a
good
solid
performer
lots
of
intricate
flavors
especially
as
it
warmed
overall
this
was
very
nice
and
a
good
blonde
ale
i
could
easily
put
down
quite
a
few
and
was
pleasantly
suprised
by
this
definatly
a
recommended
one
here
d
a
little
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
very
filling
decent
representation
of
style
but
it
just
seems
to
be
lacking
a
little
something
that
causes
it
to
fall
short
of
being
a
really
good
beer
there
are
definitely
better
beers
available
within
the
style
md
lightbodied
quite
spritzy
but
not
overly
fizzy
on
the
texture
but
it
drinks
pretty
thin
overall
due
to
lack
of
body
and
rich
flavours
im
afraid
this
beer
is
a
nearly
total
disappointment
to
me
even
though
its
not
terribly
expensive

some

mouthfeel

not

over
all
would

pretty

i
enjoyed
the
ambree
and
was
expecting
more
from
this
just
too
sweet
and
bland
for
my
liking
opinion
obviously
i
didnt
care
for
this
one
it
is
not
just
that
the
beer
is
old
and
way
past
its
prime
it
is
that
you
can
tell
that
its
prime
wasnt
all
that
great
to
begin
with
perhaps
it
is
that
i
am
not
much
for
most
not
all
french
beers
they
seem
to
have
a
common
flavor
that
is
rather
sharp
and
metallic
so
i
guess
it
is
the
water
anyway
i
wont
be
seeking
this
one
out
again
any
time
soon

for
the
style
in
drinkability
overall
pretty
pleasant
the
nose
was
very
lame
the
palate
redeemed
itself
the
mouthfeel
was
lovely
and
this
beer
is
damn
drinkable
what
the
hell
why
are
duyck
beers
jiving
with
me
so
this
would
make
a
great
summertime
beer
id
drink
this
when
id
want
something
beefier
then
a
pils
or
kolsch
i
purchased
my
bottle
in
council
bluffs
ia
i
bet
i
buy
more
it
is
simple
but
quite
nice
try
one
i
say
overall
an
enjoyable
beverage
if
a
rather
expensive
one
a
nice
change
of
pace
but
it
lacks
finesse
to
justify
the
high
end
price
tag
so
i
will
not
be
picking
this
one
up
again
an
expensive
above
average
blonde
which
has
many
lower
priced
domestic
equals
drinkability
found
nothing
really
wrong
with
this
beer
nothing
really
stands
out
about
it
being
bad
and
nothing
really
sticks
out
about
it
being
exceptional
it
was
fairly
refreshing
and
i
would
probably
buy
it
again
as
it
was
only
5
99
definitely
worth
a
try
looks
like
i
got
the
only
unskunked
bottle
out
there
avoid
the
taste
is
poorly
balanced
to
extreme
no
definition
am
wondering
what
they
are
trying
for
here
over
sugared
grapefruit
seems
to
be
the
result
drinking
this
beer
would
have
been
better
on
a
hot
day
to
quench
a
thirst
overall
not
a
bad
beer
and
definitely
not
bad
for
the
price
it
is
not
one
to
seek
out
but
if
found
cheap
it
can
be
a
good
purchase
jenlain
blonde
is
a
euro
pale
lager
that
has
designs
on
something
greater
but
has
no
idea
how
to
get
there
its
my
first
beer
from
brasserie
duyck
and
it
just
might
be
my
last
im
fairly
confident
that
the
french
can
brew
good
beer
i
just
havent
seen
any
evidence
of
it
so
far
the
dignified
little
sister
of
jenlain
amber
the
bottle
boldly
proclaims
neveau
its
lightly
sour
in
a
very
interesting
and
refreshing
way
the
microscopic
but
assertive
carbonation
plays
masterfully
with
your
tongue
the
nose
is
rather
dull
slightly
musty
with
a
bit
of
hay
and
grass
and
a
little
lemon
the
head
is
like
white
moose
the
taste
is
a
bit
like
a
light
version
of
affligem
blonde
would
taste
not
very
impressive
not
my
cup
of
tea
er
beer
not
terrible
definitely
not
worth
scouring
the
store
for
for
me
one
goblet
was
enough
overall
impression
interesting
its
like
a
light
belgian
strong
pale
ale
i
enjoyed
the
bottle
and
found
it
worth
a
possible
session
fizzy
and
light
drinkable
but
boring
maybe
i
just
expected
more
than
a
heinekin
clone
from
the
makers
of
the
fine
biere
de
garde
well
ill
have
to
say
that
id
take
a
pass
on
this
one
if
i
get
stuck
with
one
in
the
future
ill
update
this
review
if
the
skunks
are
hiding
drinkability
while
i
was
able
to
finish
the
whole
bottle
im
inclined
to
think
it
was
due
more
to
a
lack
of
good
judgment
than
anything
else
this
brew
has
no
balance
no
complexity
it
drinks
like
a
lager
and
not
a
good
one
i
suggest
you
skip
it
overall
this
was
a
decent
beer
but
not
interesting
enough
among
the
belgian
pale
ale
elites
ill
stick
to
jenlains
biere
de
garde
instead
next
time
i
am
in
st
barths
i
will
buy
some
more
of
these
not
that
they
are
that
good
but
rather
they
are
unique
and
a
conversation
piece
much
better
than
carib
or
red
stripe
the
bottle
i
am
drinking
does
not
look
like
the
picture
provided
and
instead
it
looks
like
the
picture
for
the
biere
de
garde
but
says
original
french
blonde
ale
anyways
the
beer
poured
a
pale
golden
color
with
orange
hues
to
it
the
head
was
light
and
fluffy
and
settled
nicely
the
smell
was
dominated
by
sweet
malts
and
a
light
tropical
friut
scent
the
flavor
was
good
and
if
you
are
a
malt
lover
that
you
will
feel
right
at
home
with
this
baby
the
big
malty
flavors
hit
you
right
off
the
bat
with
a
complex
sweetness
that
is
not
overbearing
but
the
thick
mouthfeel
kind
of
kills
the
drinkability
for
me
good
to
try
but
not
going
to
make
it
to
my
regular
rotation
large
green
unusual
bottle
rarely
seen
in
these
parts
pours
golden
and
clear
slight
haze
after
the
last
pour
but
i
saw
no
yeast
on
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
large
rocky
white
head
with
better
the
average
retention
leaves
nice
fine
and
well
spread
out
lacing
nose
is
dry
with
a
slight
juniper
note
quite
dry
and
crisp
but
also
with
notes
of
more
juniper
and
a
slight
soapyness
later
on
finishes
dry
lacks
the
usual
yeast
floral
notes
and
spice
expected
in
a
belgian
pale
tastes
like
a
pilsner
heineken
i
chose
not
to
drink
the
whole
thing
not
even
a
pint
given
i
have
the
choice
of
other
better
beers
to
drink
tonight
instead
pours
a
very
clean
golden
with
a
huge
rocky
head
leaving
big
globs
behind
on
its
way
downstaying
with
the
clean
theme
this
beer
has
a
clean
aroma
dry
biscuity
malt
and
herbal
hop
almost
like
a
good
german
pils
taste
has
a
light
herbalness
to
it
with
a
firm
dry
malt
backbone
with
an
iron
note
showing
thru
but
light
a
belgian
pale
alei
think
not
more
of
a
german
pilsner
and
at
6
i
think
incredibly
easy
to
drink
am
i
drinking
the
same
beer
as
the
others
who
reviewed
thismine
wasnt
skunked
iam
sure
that
helped
nice
foamy
white
head
mountainous
clear
gold
hue
displaying
minimal
carbonation
big
malty
aroma
pils
like
with
an
exquisite
sea
air
component
melting
well
with
the
grassy
and
haylike
farmhouse
elements
the
straw
scent
may
come
up
a
bit
too
much
up
front
to
my
liking
but
it
definitely
makes
me
feel
for
a
pils
musty
mellow
weird
herbs
alga
or
with
an
aquatic
feel
anyway
light
palate
malty
despite
a
hop
crunch
toward
the
finish
but
it
never
becomes
too
dry
pleasant
foamy
mouthfeel
biting
carbonation
rounder
than
a
pilsner
but
just
as
refreshing
very
disappointing
pours
out
a
pale
golden
color
with
a
nice
amount
of
carbonation
that
stays
with
you
until
the
end
so
far
so
good
right
well
the
smell
was
pretty
average
light
dose
of
hops
along
with
some
slight
malts
and
some
grainy
like
aromas
along
with
some
fruitiness
hidden
in
the
background
smelled
almost
like
a
pils
sweetness
and
more
sweetness
this
beer
got
more
unbearable
the
more
you
drink
it
the
cloyingness
is
just
too
much
some
hops
do
bite
but
its
so
sweet
that
it
doesnt
matter
some
fruit
also
pokes
through
but
again
the
sweetness
takes
over
mouthfeel
was
lightmedium
with
some
medium
carbonation
but
its
quite
cloying
22oz
bottle
of
yuck
never
buying
this
again
but
i
will
try
their
beire
de
garden
to
see
if
they
can
redeem
themselves
flavor
matches
aroma
with
a
sweet
grainy
body
that
drops
quickly
out
of
the
way
and
moves
to
a
dry
crisp
finish
24
ounce
green
bottle
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
mild
pale
malt
scent
with
a
slight
green
bottle
skunkiness
that
lingers
on
the
nose
it
smells
refreshing
but
is
a
bit
dry
the
taste
is
a
little
above
average
it
has
a
very
sweet
flavor
it
boasts
of
pale
malts
light
hops
and
a
thick
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
weird
brew
its
light
in
color
and
aroma
but
it
has
a
thick
mouthfeel
and
a
super
sweet
taste
i
guess
its
good
but
nothing
i
would
ever
buy
again
a
huge
disappointment
from
brasserie
duyck
after
the
excellent
jenlain
bière
de
garde
im
still
interested
in
trying
their
bière
du
printemps
but
ill
steer
clear
of
the
blonde
in
the
future
comes
in
a
beer
bottle
thats
kind
of
interesting
to
look
at
but
i
aint
too
sure
its
really
beer
try
it
if
youre
curious
otherwise
give
it
a
pass
it
appears
that
this
beer
is
a
dumbeddown
version
of
a
biere
de
garde
clear
more
mild
there
is
no
exotic
fruit
nor
earth
nor
even
the
slightest
peppery
bite
of
yeast
to
give
it
structure
it
is
malty
and
sweetly
alcoholic
the
texture
is
vaguely
creamy
the
intention
seems
to
be
good
but
the
result
is
a
beer
that
is
in
a
stylistic
limbo
well
crafted
nevertheless
the
best
part
about
this
beer
was
its
bottle
otherwise
i
found
this
beer
very
bland
golden
in
clolour
dull
malt
nose
somewhat
dry
with
a
light
malty
finish
i
think
mississaugamatt
hit
the
nail
on
the
head
when
he
said
vegetal
and
cornlike
i
dont
think
i
would
ever
buy
this
beer
again
very
drinkable
and
light
would
make
a
great
beer
on
a
hot
afternoon
on
the
middle
of
the
summer
650
ml
bottle
i
dont
normally
remark
on
the
packaging
as
it
differs
from
country
to
country
etc
but
the
tall
painted
label
green
glass
bottle
with
the
ridged
neck
is
very
nice
theres
only
one
problem
the
beer
is
skunked
thats
fairly
disturbing
since
its
not
cheap
it
pours
a
hazy
golden
with
a
very
light
orange
cast
and
a
thin
creamy
bright
white
head
i
cant
pick
up
anything
in
the
aroma
beyond
the
skunkiness
based
on
that
id
guess
that
its
got
a
fairly
hoppy
aroma
when
fresh
but
i
cant
be
sure
the
body
is
medium
with
an
exceptionally
fine
carbonation
that
leaves
it
creamy
and
surprisingly
smooth
in
the
mouth
interestingly
it
does
not
seem
to
be
bottle
conditioned
no
yeast
in
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
although
it
might
be
with
the
yeast
still
in
suspension
explaining
the
haze
the
flavor
is
very
nice
but
quite
onesided
theres
a
light
fruitiness
soft
summer
fruits
and
a
rich
very
soft
and
nicely
rounded
sweet
and
lightly
earthy
maltiness
thats
well
entwined
with
a
light
hoppiness
surprisingly
malty
what
hops
are
present
seem
lightly
grassy
and
fairly
spicy
the
bitterness
is
wellbalanced
and
supports
the
rich
malt
character
and
dries
out
the
long
finish
as
well
as
leaving
a
lingering
bitter
note
id
hope
that
i
can
one
day
taste
this
beer
without
the
skunked
character
this
is
a
very
mild
and
drinkable
beer
that
would
seem
very
appropriate
when
you
are
looking
for
a
lightbodied
beer
particularly
in
the
summer
a
great
example
of
a
lawnmower
beer
o
a
very
light
brew
reminds
me
of
some
belgian
pale
ales
like
cuvee
de
trolls
but
much
more
foamy
in
texture
got
it
in
china
seeing
its
a
biere
de
guard
but
not
overwhelmed
cool
bottle
solid
blonde
biere
de
garde
clearly
different
from
a
belgian
blonde
not
great
but
worth
a
try
overal
a
good
beer
the
brew
is
very
refreshing
but
is
somewhat
subtle
this
is
good
on
a
hot
summer
day
but
also
doesnt
make
it
stand
out
very
much
o
this
beer
is
pleasant
to
drink
and
doesnt
have
any
strong
flavors
so
it
would
be
well
suited
to
pair
with
a
meal
especially
with
a
dish
that
uses
apples
o
the
buttery
notes
brought
down
the
ratings
otherwise
not
too
shabby
overall
drinkability
very
drinkable
fantastic
with
food
kind
of
wish
i
had
it
in
a
different
glass
as
i
think
the
smell
may
have
come
out
more
but
otherwise
a
good
beer
definitely
one
of
the
better
french
beers
ive
had
remarks
did
not
score
a
t
s
m
at
that
time
so
please
disregard
those
scores
o
what
is
unique
in
its
malt
flavors
and
mouthfeel
are
about
all
that
makes
its
ale
noteworthy
all
in
all
its
okay
i
could
see
having
it
again
if
i
came
across
it
on
draft
httpabarwithnoname
wordpress
com
n
b
i
tasted
this
after
the
official
date
of
expiry
however
i
am
quite
certain
the
beer
sustains
cellaring
of
one
to
two
years
after
bottling
quite
well
nothing
here
is
bad
nothing
is
too
much
its
well
balanced
but
nothing
is
terribly
interesting
either
overall
this
is
a
mild
improvement
over
leffe
as
far
as
regular
beer
choice
goes
here
in
northern
france
although
its
so
close
to
cider
i
would
just
buy
that
if
this
didnt
have
a
leg
up
in
the
abv
on
the
nose
we
think
of
lager
but
with
a
subtle
touch
of
brown
sugar
the
body
is
light
scent
with
a
bitterness
that
makes
it
dirty
mouth
while
she
is
far
from
good
a
feeling
of
artificiality
complete
the
observation
that
beer
is
just
ordinary
pleasant
to
drink
but
there
are
much
better
unless
youre
an
absolute
fanatic
ofbienvenue
chez
les
chtis
movie
overall
what
we
found
most
enjoyable
about
this
brew
was
picking
apart
the
complexity
of
the
aroma
the
strong
musty
earthiness
is
actually
quite
inviting
and
asks
the
drinker
to
dive
down
deeper
what
was
even
nicer
was
how
many
of
the
aromatic
credits
made
appearances
in
the
flavor
with
a
surprising
cameo
from
some
bittering
hops
right
out
front
we
found
this
to
be
a
nice
example
of
the
style
as
a
whole
and
were
pleased
that
it
was
able
to
contain
many
of
the
primary
characteristics
of
it
within
d
not
one
to
go
for
smell
and
taste
muted
there
are
much
better
expressions
of
the
style
available
d
not
too
interesting
for
the
style
its
fine
to
drink
now
but
i
probably
wont
buy
again
i
was
at
the
blue
martini
bar
on
st
martinst
maarten
recently
besides
all
of
the
usual
caribbean
beers
offered
i
noticed
they
had
leffe
on
draft
so
as
i
sat
down
i
saw
they
had
a
few
chti
bottles
behind
the
bar
so
i
ordered
one
instead
first
up
was
the
blonde
poured
into
a
chti
triple
goblet
hazy
yellow
body
slight
carbonation
with
a
moderate
sized
head
taste
was
very
nice
something
i
had
not
had
on
this
trip
a
nice
yeasty
and
sugary
belgian
style
ale
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
full
this
was
a
terrific
find
and
a
great
beer
in
comparison
to
all
the
other
lagers
i
had
been
drinking
that
week
reminded
of
chablis
summery
but
not
as
much
character
as
other
in
the
style
this
is
a
crystal
yellow
beer
smells
fairly
good
reminds
a
good
belgian
blond
close
to
leffe
perhaps
not
bad
for
a
french
beer
despite
of
the
6
4
you
do
not
feel
much
alcohol
which
helps
the
drinkability
it
should
be
a
good
option
for
a
sunny
day
followed
by
a
barbecue
and
listening
to
gainsbourg
overall
not
a
bad
brew
but
i
wont
need
to
revisit
i
love
this
beer
i
dont
care
how
it
looks
i
care
how
about
everything
else
and
thats
where
it
scores
well
for
me
i
enjoy
maibocks
quite
a
bit
so
finding
something
slightly
dialed
back
just
hits
the
spot
for
me
plus
with
a
8oz
bottle
at
6
4
you
could
knock
back
plenty
of
these
for
a
good
session
this
one
at
the
gatineau
select
saq
pours
light
blond
with
big
thick
white
head
less
so
in
others
cups
a
mild
spiciness
lighter
easy
drinking
mouthfeel
in
fact
i
found
this
reasonable
hoppy
bitterness
with
some
sugar
and
malt
and
something
akin
to
an
american
take
on
a
belgian
blond
chti
is
not
the
best
example
of
the
bière
de
garde
style
ill
limit
my
consumption
of
it
to
sitting
at
home
in
front
of
the
television
or
over
a
lowstakes
card
game
a
delightful
beer
highly
recommended
and
a
great
accompaniment
to
food
overall
very
good
one
although
it
felt
too
light
very
very
drinkable
and
alcohol
could
not
be
felt
at
all
exellent
and
refreshing
ill
buy
it
again
bottle

had

was

but
not
in

good

with
the
caramel

dominating
and
some
mild

thought
this
tasted
too
much
like
a
brown
ale
or
dubbel
light
bodied
and
not
difficult
to
drink
but
nothing
interesting
about
it
that
would
make
me
want
to
try
it
again
drinks
pretty
easy
a
nice
quencher
nothing
super
midblowing
here
but
the
cleaness
of
this
helps
drinkabilty
a
training
wheels
saison
but
i
preffer
this
to
some
ott
saisons
ive
had
again
no
real
mouthfeel
so
no
drinkability
either
d
a
bit
repulsive
at
first
i
grew
to
really
enjoy
it
once
room
temperature
it
becomes
a
rather
interesting
beer
the
mouth
is
moderate
with
just
enough
carbonation
to
get
by
pairs
well
with
sharp
cheddar
and
monterey
jack
a
good
beer
but
nothing
i
would
seek
out
in
a
store
that
has
a
large
selection
chti
was
a
decent
albeit
relatively
expensive
10

blond
biere

it
appears
to
have
been
brewed
by
the
brasserie
benifontaine
the
same
brewery
which
produces
the
notably
less
expensive
castelain
blond
biere

all
things
being
equal
among
blond
bieres

chti
was
enjoyable
but
not
as
much
so
as
its
relative
castelain
another

never
seen
any
of
these
chti
beers
here
in
the

pours
clear

golden
with
a
large
pillowy
white

smell
is
rather
funky
musty
earthy
and
grassy
quite
herbal
and
dry
earthy
notes
of
hay
and
dried

balance
the
herbacious
hoppy
finish
bubbly
carbonation
finishes
dry
as
this
beer
warmed
it
began
to
grow
on
me
more
and
more
though
it
still
is
not
one
i
would
seek
out
again
nonetheless
its

a

the
bottle
says
biere
de
garde
this
beer
is
not
a
saison
and
not
quite
a
biere
de
garde
a
very
light
and
refreshing
beer
i
could
see
opening
a
bottle
while
sitting
as
a
small
cafe
in
france
the
head
was
decent
but
didnt
last
long
enough
hard
to
get
anything
from
the
smell
in
the
bar
some
notes
of
wheat
and
anise
the
taste
is
interestingy
round
very
creamy
almost
like
sour
cream
notes
of
white
wine
fruity
but
a
bit
dry
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
thick
and
a
bit
chewy
with
some
spicy
notes
kind
of
still
from
the
tap
but
i
liked
it
i
paired
this
one
with
some
sharp
cheddar
cheese
to
draw
out
the
apple
flavors
a
competent
take
on
the
bière
de
garde
style
but
nothing
amazing
if
youre
interested
in
trying
a
bière
de
garde
id
recommend
starting
with
jenlains
first
still
a
decent
beer
and
legions
away
from
the
lamentable
french
macros
one
of
my
favorite
beers
lots
of
grape
taste
come
through
like
a
sparkling
wine
very
refreshing
with
a
complex
taste
i
dont
remember
any
other
beers
in
this
style
being
quite
so
sweet
this
one
has
a
real
lingering
sugar
content
to
it
almost
distracting
and
certainly
in
the
way
of
the
more
delicate
grassy
hops
and
the
near
saison
type
farmy
yeast
i
think
the
malt
is
a
little
heavy
in
this
one
a
little
less
cleaned
up
than
it
could
be
by
a
very
cool
yeast
strain
that
has
some
traits
of
warmer
fermentation
with
high
tone
fruit
notes
and
again
the
sugar
maybe
not
quite
done
still
its
a
real
enjoyable
beer
beautiful
in
the
glass
and
holding
a
head
all
the
way
great
carbonation
and
a
lot
more
body
than
i
think
the
style
calls
for
as
undefined
as
it
still
is
love
the
yeast
flavor
and
the
straw
notes
in
this
i
think
its
got
late
summer
written
all
over
it
but
if
this
was
even
20
drier
i
think
it
would
be
a
far
better
beer
still
nice
to
see
some
of
the
french
stuff
coming
around
and
i
think
it
has
some
cool
culinary
applications
i
enjoyed
it
with
a
black
garlic
and
octopus
dish
at
bittersweet
on
alameda
great
spot
cool
beer
program
overall
my
first
authentic
french
biere
de
garde
and
it
didnt
disappoint
flavors
and
aromas
all
play
together
expertly
well
yeast
driven
nose
with
tropical
fruit
spice
and
light
biscuit
and
light
sugar
it
pours
a
slightly
hazy
gold
with
light
copper
highlights
a
fruity
palate
with
caramel
apricot
to
pineapple
and
a
suspicion
of
papaya
are
a
perfect
base
for
the
above
average
carbonation
and
medium
body
as
it
traverses
the
tongue
to
finish
with
a
light
pepper
note
there
are
not
a
lot
of
hops
a
clean
and
straightforward
biere
de
garde
very
nice
and
super
drinkable
pours
a
clear
medium
orange
with
sediment
fluffy
off
white
head
clumpy
rings
down
the
glass
smell
fruity
apple
pear
with
soft
graininess
floral
buttery
note
taste
juicy
nectarine
almost
ripe
pear
grapeskin
biscuit
and
honey
mildly
spicy
middle
then
finishing
dry
with
just
slightly
tart
nectarine
lots
of
pale
malt
sweetness
throughout
not
the
most
complex
but
tasty

bottling
noted
on
the
back
of
the
label
nice
fizz
on
pour
smell
is
bland
oldish
slight
acidic
fruits
taste
is
nonexistent
which
is
quite
a
feat
for
a
6
4
brew
slightly
sour
but
not
much
not
offensive
not
exciting
slight
cherry
as
i
take
a
few
more
sips
still
fizzy
like
a
champagne
and
overall
pretty
neutral
which
is
not
a
bad
thing
four
loco
tastes
like
crap
and
gives
hang
overs
im
sure
this
is
much
more
tolerable
overall
pretty
tasty
and
quite
drinkable
this
would
make
a
fantastic
leafraking
beer
or
perhaps
an
accompaniment
to
pumpkin
pie
did
i
mention
autumnal
the
taste
has
the
same
toasted
malt
and
biscuit
character
with
a
touch
of
grain
and
a
clean
mildly
hopped
finish
but
it
had
a
kind
of
pilsener
quality
to
it
which
i
did
not
expect
o
the
beer
is
pretty
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
hiding
the
6
4
abv
very
well
i
enjoyed
this
one
and
i
would
definitely
get
it
again
it
would
pair
well
with
just
about
any
food
poured
into
a
gouyasse
tulip
glass
pours
a
bright
medium
golden
amber
with
a
three
finger
white
head
that
dissipates
slowly
leaving
tons
of
lacing
aroma
of
bready
malt
grassy
slightly
floral
hops
and
a
hint
of
funk
flavor
begins
with
sweet
malt
apple
and
pear
juice
belgian
yeast
but
then
turns
somewhat
drier
finishing
with
light
grassy
hops
and
a
more
saison
yeast
flavor
light
to
medium
bodied
with
bright
carbonation
an
nice
take
on
the
biere
de
garde
style
flavor
is
somewhat
subdued
but
the
flavor
transition
from
sweet
fruit
to
drier
spritzer
is
quite
nice
very
refreshing
flavor
and
carbonation
o
its
wellgarded
just
very
mild
and
nondescript
in
flavor
quite
drinkable
altogether
though
id
never
seek
it
out
for
its
taste
may
be
best
enjoyed
with
a
light
meal
of
salad
and
fish
o
very
nice
beer
o
i
would
definitely
have
this
beer
again
the
smell
throws
me
off
a
little
but
i
can
overlook
that
pours
a
clear
golden
color
54
inch
head
of
an
offwhite
color
great
retention
and
good
lacing
smells
of
strong
pale
malt
sweet
malt
slight
alcohol
hint
of
hop
hint
of
yeast
and
slight
caramel
malt
fits
the
style
of
a
biere
de
garde
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
there
is
also
a
noticeable
dryness
tastes
of
sweet
malt
pale
malt
slight
alcohol
hint
of
yeast
hint
of
hop
and
slight
caramel
malt
overall
decent
appearance
good
blend
and
decent
aroma
for
a
biere
de
garde
the
body
is
lacking
in
potency
though
the
flavor
is
still
good
a
great
under
appreciated
version
of
an
under
appreciated
style
really
well
done
something
i
enjoyed
and
would
recommend
overall
based
on
the
price
i
expected
a
little
more
here
its
still
a
decent
beer
just
nothing
that
blew
me
away
the
coconut
type
flavour
is
interesting
though
a
tasty
little
french
beer
the
bitterness
level
seems
just
a
bit
too
sharp
to
me
perhaps
its
the
combination
with
the
mild
alcohol
presence
that
i
get
that
in
any
case
its
rather
good
for
a
lightly
malty
thirst
quencher
overall
a
decent
bière
de
garde
and
a
good
table
beer
but
not
my
favorite
enjoyable
but
not
outstanding
o
for
sure
i
will
buy
this
one
many
more
times
not
quite
sure
if
it
would
work
as
a
session
beer
but
for
sure
one
is
not
enough
because
of
its
great
taste
and
elegance
dvery
easy
drinking
crisp
and
flavorful
beer
i
picked
this
one
up
after
reading
the
brewmasters
table
and
im
glad
i
did
a
very
nice
and
decently
priced
750ml
t
overall
drinkability
i
had
this
with
a
meal
chicken
and
couscous
with
a
moroccan
harissa
sauce
and
it
went
really
well
by
itself
its
pretty
good
as
well
an
amazing
beer
to
look
at
and
a
neat
style
to
try
out
i
will
have
to
revisit
this
style
again
and
see
what
other
brewers
provide
jd
pours
a
hazy
orangeish
color
with
a
light
tan
head
in
the
aroma
floral
and
a
small
candi
sugar
in
the
taste
a
dry
floral
flavor
hints
of
candi
sugar
and
small
notes
of
hops
and
honey
a
small
hop
bite
and
medium
to
lighter
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
floral
and
hop
aftertaste
nice
mellow
presence
of
flavors
and
easy
to
drink
overall
first
of
the
style
for
me
but
judging
from
this
example
it
appears
to
be
a
style
ill
seek
out
again
overall
this
beer
is
fantastic
i
wanna
brew
one
of
these
on
the
whole
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
its
just
malty
enough
to
give
it
a
bit
of
flavor
punch
with
other
subtle
flavors
that
round
out
a
very
complete
taste
other
elements
are
solid
as
well
providing
a
pretty
complex
and
enjoyable
brew
recommended
as
a
nice
spring
or
summer
sipper
o
this
is
a
pretty
nice
biere
de
garde
nice
value
and
tastes
quite
good
overall
nice
but
not
outstanding
im
not
superfamiliar
with
the
style
but
i
could
see
this
as
a
tart
frenchstyle
ale
o
i
enjoyed
this
quite
much
hadnt
had
a
biere
de
garde
before
so
this
was
a
very
pleasant
treat
indeed
a
aged
pilsner
hop
quality
golden
mild
murky
in
look
with
a
subtle
but
sufficient
white
head
not
something
for
the
boisterous
drinker
but
something
made
to
sit
age
hops
quality
with
spice
brisk
but
pollen
quality
a
bit
citrus
malt
blend
but
its
hard
to
say
if
that
is
infused
or
inherent
in
the
beer
orange
peel
honey
blossom
grass
smoked
meat
and
something
distinctly
mineral
but
not
metallic
dry
but
not
subdued
nose
is
unique
in
comparison
to
a
aged
palate
quality
but
it
was
bought
from
a
place
where
the
beer
was
not
something
of
interest
great
for
smoked
meat
diluted
with
a
creamy
cheese
d
the
beer
is
easy
to
drink
and
has
some
refreshing
properties
d
insanely
refreshing
i
could
drink
this
all
summer
d
very
drinkable
tasty
and
crisp
although
it
does
come
off
as
just
a
touch
watery
very
nice
medium
body
with
good
carbonation
enough
to
swish
around
not
heavy
nor
watery
very
easy
to
drink
and
enjoy
dthis
is
a
great
drinking
beer
that
i
would
have
again
no
funk
though
i
know
that
the
style
doesnt
deem
it
a
necessary
component
the
palate
opens
rather
sweet
with
a
blend
of
honey
splenda
and
some
sugar
sweeter
than
i
like
my
bdgs
to
be
this
does
have
a
mild
balancing
hop
character
though
not
enough
in
my
book
earthy
hops
are
present
and
the
finish
is
light
with
a
rather
unpleasant
splendalike
artificial
sweetness
along
with
a
little
bitterness
grassy
in
nature
mildly
fruity
theres
a
delicate
interplay
between
citrus
and
light
stone
fruit
here
light
in
body
with
a
fairly
crisp
carbonation
this
is
decent
apart
from
the
finish
ill
pick
up
the
st
sylvestre
bdgs
over
this
though
pours
a
hazy
tan
with
a
12
inch
head
which
persists
taste
is
pretty
much
a
generic
ale
to
me
and
had
no
citrus
like
some
of
the
other
whites
ill
admit
the
classy
tall
corked
bottle
is
what
lured
me
in
plus
the
fact
we
dont
see
a
lot
of
french
beers
hit
the
shelves
where
we
live
unlike
the
corsican
beer
i
reviewed
recently
i
really
dont
see
anything
too
unique
with
this
one
though
still
drinkable
of
course
this
is
a
horrendous
biere
de
garge
run
far
far
away
it
pours
a
hazy
hay
color
with
a
nice
foamy
one
and
a
half
finger
head
it
leaves
a
decent
lacing
on
the
glass
the
beer
smells
malty
and
fruity
slightly
musty
with
a
little
yeast
this
bière
de
garde
has
a
great
malt
profile
with
fruity
flavors
and
very
light
hop
flavor
it
has
a
lively
carbonation
thats
refreshing
with
medium
body
its
an
excellent
beer
with
interesting
flavors
shared
with
some
coworkers
who
enjoyed
it
as
well
this
is
one
of
the
better
biere
de
gardes
d
this
is
the
french
session
brew
it
is
so
easy
to
drink
like
many
of
the
vinous
counterparts
that
come
from
france
if
this
beer
were
burgundy
it
would
definitely
fall
in
the
premier
cru
category
tasty
indeed
d
refreshing
light
and
very
enjoyable
out
of
a
750ml
corked
and
caged
bottle
pours
a
hazy
straw
color
with
honey
hightlights
big
meringue
white
head
that
left
chunky
lacing
on
the
side
of
the
glass
the
aroma
has
the
farmhouse
effect
spicy
with
clove
white
pepper
and
horse
blanket
some
light
lemon
fruitiness
and
mild
apple
skins
the
taste
is
of
pale
malt
grainy
sweetness
light
honey
and
metal
unfortunately
the
funky
yeast
is
subdued
by
the
malt
moderate
feel
tingly
carbonation
finishes
quite
neutral
with
a
touch
of
a
grassy
hop
the
brew
starts
off
great
but
just
coasts
its
way
through
the
rather
bland
malt
crushes
the
yeast
and
muddles
any
of
the
nice
flavors
there
is
no
off
flavors
and
is
well
made
but
is
just
ok
biere
de
gardes
are
all
about
the
caramel
malt
and
this
is
absent
is
this
offering
this
is
a
tasty
enjoyable
and
very
drinkable
brew
quite
refreshing
im
absolutely
flying
through
this
bottle
because
its
so
smooth
good
stuff
drinkability
close
to
a
saison
in
style
but
with
too
much
sweetness
and
lacking
the
herbal
complexity
still
a
decent
beer
fairly
drinkable
brew
but
not
my
favorite
330ml
bottle
into
a
dfh
signature
glass
pours
a
slightly
hazy
orangeyellow
with
a
thin
eggshell
head
that
diminishes
to
a
thin
layer
and
leaves
no
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
is
slight
toasted
malts
and
hints
of
sweet
fruits
the
taste
is
a
decent
amount
of
fruity
malts
and
slight
hop
bitterness
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
with
slight
alcohol
warmth
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
not
likely
one
id
have
again
someone
else
here
described
this
as
reminiscent
of
an
american
adjunct
beer
i
couldnt
agree
more
this
is
the
only
biere
de
garde
ive
ever
had
and
i
cant
say
i
would
try
another
major
disappointment
castelain
is
my
favorite
biere
de
garde
it
is
a
beautifully
earthy
and
comforting
beer
and
i
love
it
for
that
pair
with
comfort
food
when
every
possible
poured
into
a
tulip
this
is
a
very
hazy
golden
orange
a
nice
white
head
forms
and
dissipates
very
slowly
leaving
a
foam
sheet
and
a
good
deal
of
lacing
smell
is
slightly
caramellike
malt
with
a
hint
of
sour
fruit
some
earthiness
and
a
lot
of
floral
notes
in
the
background
very
nice
the
taste
is
again
strongly
malty
with
a
stony
character
strong
floral
notes
and
a
good
amount
of
hop
bitterness
make
this
a
very
well
balanced
complex
beer
palate
is
nice
slightly
thick
without
being
syrupy
could
use
a
bit
more
carbonation
overall
a
quality
beer
with
a
lot
of
character
my
first
beer
in
this
style
and
im
not
especially
impressed
i
might
have
picked
the
wrong
time
of
year
to
try
this
summer
might
have
been
a
better
time
for
one
of
these
ill
have
to
try
some
different
ones
to
get
a
better
feel
for
this
style
thanks
to
mrmojorisin
for
the
sample
not
thin
smooth
with
mild
to
moderate
carbonation
that
can
be
slightly
fluffy
d
a
good
biere
de
garde
i
think
it
would
work
better
complementing
food
never
really
drank
this
one
by
itself
before
poured
into
a
stella
chalice
mild
carbonation
nice
white
head
that
laces
the
glass
the
entire
session
and
a
dull
golden
hue
the
aroma
is
sweet
malt
and
crisp
hopsgrass
the
taste
is
candy
sweet
malt
followed
by
a
clean
crisp
hop
bite
a
drying
aftertaste
from
the
hops
is
throughout
the
session
not
very
balanced
and
the
body
is
a
little
weak
this
is
the
first
of
the
style
that
i
have
had
and
i
need
to
try
a
few
more
brews
this
is
a
very
good
bdg
id
say
the
style
is
the
perfect
summer
farmhouse
style
ale
recommended
i
was
a
bit
surprised
at
drinkability
after
the
first
few
sips
but
it
does
have
a
refreshing
smoothness
and
something
likeable
despite
the
sharp
almost
metallic
notes
that
come
in
and
out
its
not
one
of
my
favs
of
the
style
but
a
nice
one
nevertheless
you
definitely
need
to
try
this
and
i
will
have
it
again
pours

with

with

and

with

followed
by

and
a
dusty

the
end
mediumlight

finishing
dry
smoothness
increases
as
the
carbonation
lessens
nice
and
refreshing
the
drink
is
soft
and
mellow
with
perfect
carbonation
and
is
undeniably
smooth
with
wonderful
drinkability
an
authentic
bière
de
garde
from
france
but
i
was
expecting
a
little
better
journey
the
overall
flavor
seemed
a
little
light
for
me
ordered
a
bottle
of
castelain
while
having
drinks
at
brasserie
jo
on
huntington
ave
poured
in
into
a
house
logo
tulip
glass
pours
with
a
nice
white
fluffy
head
the
color
was
golden
yellow
with
a
slight
bit
of
haze
to
it
the
smell
was
of
hay
and
grass
like
a
country
breeze
the
taste
was
sharp
with
a
pronounced
corn
flavor
to
it
very
easy
drinking
and
paired
well
with
the
apps
we
were
eating
not
an
overwhelming
flavor
but
a
nice
accompaniment
to
food
a
great
mild
weather
beer
as
its
light
but
yet
has
some
substance
to
it
verdict
i
like
this
version
of
biere
de
garde
better
its
lighter
and
appeals
to
the
palate
more
drinkability
a
complex
beer
to
quaff
but
still
quite
pleasant
drinkability
i
would
be
more
than
happy
to
drink
this
again
a
pleasant
and
enjoyable
surprise
i
wish
more
bieres
de
garde
were
readily
available
overall
not
worth
my
time
i
am
sad
that
i
spent
a
decent
amount
of
money
on
this
i
could
have
got
a
case
of
bud
for
the
price
of
this
one
bottle
not
that
i
would
want
to
oh
well
not
every
beer
can
be
great
d
not
very
drinkable
the
sweetness
is
overwhelming
and
a
bit
unpleasant
ill
pass
on
this
one
next
time
but
im
open
to
trying
more
of
the
style
malty
grain
sweet
grass
bread
finish
is
semidry
with
herbal
notes
that
last
excellent
biere
de
garde
a
little
sweet
to
be
used
indiscriminately
at
the
table
like
others
of
the
style
but
this
one
could
perk
up
many
a
dish
overall
this
was
my
first
biere
de
garde
so
i
might
not
be
the
best
judge
but
i
wasnt
all
that
impressed
with
it
not
anything
to
turn
me
off
about
it
but
nothing
to
turn
me
on
either
light
sweet
easy
drinker
about
the
same
flavors
and
complexity
of
a
good
pils
notes
there
wasnt
any
glaring
flaws
with
that
said
it
wasnt
memorable
in
any
way
either
hoppier
than
most
ive
had
but
lacks
any
character
or
depth
pass
750ml
brown
caged
and
corked
bottle
pours
slightly
murky
light
yellow
with
a
thin
film
of
white
head
smells
malty
and
fruity
with
maybe
a
hint
of
mustiness
tastes
sweet
with
fruit
roast
and
slight
musty
notes
light
bodied
hard
to
describe
since
i
havent
had
too
many
beers
like
this
one
really
drinkable
and
refreshing
though
as
well
as
pleasant
and
tasty
not
something
id
have
everyday
but
its
a
good
beer
yup
tastes
like
a
light
euro
lager
not
american
cause
its
mostly
all
pils
malts
im
usually
not
a
stickler
for
style
characteristics
but
this
is
nothing
like
what
its
supposed
to
be
poured
nicely
with
a
straw
and
golden
color
smelled
like
a
mix
of
corn
and
cough
syrup
i
found
it
strangely
similar
to
a
name
brand
pilsner
in
the
fact
that
it
almost
tasted
skunked
the
lack
of
fruit
and
quick
finish
let
me
down
a
bit
overall
i
was
let
down
i
thought
it
would
have
more
fruit
and
a
stronger
finish
easy
drinking
but
not
much
else
i
guess
i
am
a
bit
dissapointed
not
that
it
wasnt
a
good
beer
i
just
expected
more
pours
a
strong
carary
yellow
straw
color
with
a
slight
haze
abundantly
carbonated
with
an
initial
strong
retention
but
fleeted
quickly
no
lacing
to
mention
smells
nearly
skunked
but
certainly
pungent
catty
earthy
and
musky
sweetness
pilner
malts
is
the
lead
character
through
the
nose
and
flavors
with
a
sturdiness
but
no
grainy
flavors
or
bite
the
hops
bring
out
a
light
muskiness
and
barnyardey
character
but
not
intense
enough
to
greatly
impact
the
beer
feels
like
a
firm
pilsner
with
hardly
no
tartness
sourness
or
astringency
finishes
medium
dry
with
a
lingering
pungent
aroma
and
flavor
a
solid
brew
but
i
just
wanted
more
of
the
funk
intensity
tried
again
4907
may
be
a
fresher
bottle
as
the
hop
profile
is
much
stronger
than
i
recall
grass
oranges
i
liked
it
better
this
time
around
bottle
size
also
different
11
2
oz
so
not
sure
if
that
made
a
difference
in
both
cases
first
beer
of
a
session
so
pretty
comfortable
with
observations
this
reminded
me
of
a
cross
between
a
saison
and
a
wit
bier
this
was
really
way
too

bought
this
at
tullys
cant
remember
what
i
paid
for
it
but
i
remember
thinking
it
was
a
pretty
good
deal
it
was
a
strawcolored
beer
with
a
wonderfully
thick
head
it
had
a
nice
floral
aroma
as
well
as
some
citrus
it
was
a
spicy
hoppy
flavor
which
i
enjoyed
a
trifle
on
the
bland
side
but
quite
drinkable
this
bottle
has
been
in
the
cellar
for
two
years
light
malt
hay
dough
sprucea
little
and
a
bit
of
hops
in
the
aroma
also
some
pepper
and

offwhite
creamy
head
with
excellent

body
was
orange
and
clear
light
sweet
taste
with
average
finish
texture
was

not
nearly
as
much
carbonation
as
what
i
had
two
years
ago
this
has
mellowed
quite
a
bit
as
i
remember
i
didnt
much
care
for
the
fresh
version
gorgeous
pale
straw
perfect
clarity
rocky
head
lightly
toasted
malts
and
faint
herbal
hops
on
the
nose
palate
is
very
pure
toasted
malt
a
little
sweet
through
the
finish
with
some
light
herbal
hops
like
hay
id
prefer
a
little
more
bitterness
or
yeast
complexity
but
this
is
well
done
and
straightforward
mouthfeel
is
very
light
and
refreshing
but
is
a
little
out
of
whack
with
the
taste
as
it
almost
leads
me
to
expect
a
more
refreshing
flavor
but
this
doesnt
possess
the
necessary
bitterness
hugely
drinkable
last
swigs
if
ever
a
beer
resemble
cream
soda
this
is
it
smooth
restrained
enjoyable
bierre
de
garde
much
softer
than
heavyweight
biere
dart
the
cork
came
violently
out
deflecting
off
the
ceiling
the
pour
is
golden
with
a
large
head
the
nose
has
belgian
yeast
some
citrus
pilsner
malts
spicy
noble
hops
and
the
faintest
hint
of
brett
the
taste
is
light
and
crisp
like
a
pilsner
earthy
herbal
lemon
and
spice
flavors
join
forces
with
smooth
somewhat
biscuity
malts
to
create
a
very
nice
biere
de
garde
i
had
no
problem
finishing
the
750
ml
bottle
drinkability
i
am
surprised
the
taste
of
a
tripel
with
the
punch
of
a
weaker
beer
very
hard
to
pass
this
one
up
it
is
my
first
biere
de
garde
as
i
mentioned
and
look
forward
to
exploring
more
light
gold
with
a
white
head
semihazy
light
seems
to
be
the
theme
of
this
beer
with
a
delicate
spiciness
on
the
nose
likewise
on
the
palate
in
fact
im
rather
struck
by
the
easy
nature
of
this
beers
flavor
profile
a
medium
spritziness
imparts
a
lively
mouthfeel
that
stirs
things
up
in
a
welcome
fashion
castelain
is
light
and
easy
and
refreshing
it
doesnt
blow
my
mind
but
it
does
have
its
place
r
of
a
group
of
blond
bieres
de
garde
that
i
have
tasted
castelian
was
one
of
my
favorites
it
was
relatively
delicate
and
well
balanced
it
would
likely
be
enjoyed
by
beer
drinkers
of
every
degree
of
sophistication
as
a
side
note
castelian
is
been
brewed
by
the
brasserie
benifontaine
the
same
brewery
which
produces
the
notably
more
expensive
chti
blond
biere
de
garde
although
these
beers
are
quite
similar
in
appearance
and
share
a
number
of
characteristics
castelain
is
more
enjoyable
as
well
as
less
expensive
than
its
relative
chti
this
brew
pours
a
hazy
pale
golden
color
the
head
is
onefinger
in
height
creamy
and
white
the
aroma
is
malty
with
a
noble
hop
presence
earthy
citrus
and
orange
notes
give
it
a
lot
of
complexity
the
taste
is
amazing
it
is
earthy
with
some
juicy
citrus
notes
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
bodied
with
nice
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
it
is
the
first
biere
de
garde
i
have
tasted
and
i
am
hoping
that
other
in
the
style
are
similar
to
this
beer
poured
a
sparse
light
head
that
segued
into
nothingness
had
a
very
strawlike
appearance
with
some
cloudiness
and
a
grainy
look
very
faint
wiff
of
malt
and
a
little
grainy
hops
tasted
very
faintly
of
earth
grass
mixed
malt
but
other
than
that
all
the
flavors
were
very
subdued
a
semilight
mouthfeel
with
a
spritz
of
lemon
thrown
into
the
mix
not
what
i
expected
at
all
very
bland
and
not
worth
picking
up
another
bottle
still
its
a
fair
representative
of
the
style
and
i
imagine
it
would
be
fairly
refreshing
if
just
a
tad
too
sticky
in
the
throat
on
a
hot
summer
day
not
bad
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
with
moderate
head
smell
is
a
little
like
a
macrolager
with
the
same
light
wheat
maltness
taste
is
light
with
a
touch
of
honey
the
malt
can
be
tasted
too
i
would
say
that
its
a
dark
mixed
with
a
light
which
adds
to
a
fluffier
consistancy
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
both
good
but
this
is
a
little
too
sweet
for
me
also
its
hard
to
get
over
the
smell
when
its
like
bud
very
clean
and
crisp
the
carbonation
cuts
through
the
flavors
quite
well
the
body
is
still
medium
and
a
bit
creamy
as
well
quite
good
not
only
a
good
match
for
thanksgiving
turkey
but
a
good
beer
to
sit
back
and
drink
either
way
i
prefer
the
darker
maltier
versions
of
the
biere
de
garde
style
however
even
as
a
blond
this
beer
seemed
to
be
lacking
a
certain
degree
of
complexity
found
in
other
versions
of
the
style
decent
maltiness
but
nothing
to
drool
over
a
nice
beer
de
garde
poured
out
to
a
deep
golden
yellow
hue
with
some
haziness
some
notes
of
lace
and
medium
high
level
of
carbonation
aromas
of
malt
and
yeast
with
some
sweet
citrus
notes
taste
was
along
the
same
lines
as
the
aroma
but
a
bit
lighter
and
lacked
the
depth
of
what
i
wouldve
really
liked
flavors
of
malt
and
light
herbs
were
mild
on
the
palate
with
a
medium
dry
finish
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
decent
drinkability
but
overall
this
brew
did
not
really
do
it
for
me
worthy
of
a
try
for
fans
of
the
style
the
bubbliness
dissipated
into
a
smooth
very
drinkable
beer
from
750ml
dated
310805
pours
very
pale
yellow
in
color
almost
translucent
head
forms
but
is
quickly
dissipated
leaving
thin
film
i
detect
no
aroma
first
sip
reveals
a
malty
but
very
very
subtle
taste
slight
earthiness
and
chalky
taste
i
cannot
overemphasize
how
subtle
this
beer
is
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
on
the
thin
side
now
getting
a
slight
grassy
and
manure
flavor
to
the
beer
after
taking
a
big
gulp
you
can
easily
down
this
beer
as
it
goes
down
like
a
lawnmower
beer
with
a
bit
more
character
than
straight
pilsner
pours
a
hazy
peach
with
a
big
white
head
and
lots
of
bubbles
very
spicy
saaz
hop
aroma
yeasty
bready
estery
and
a
whiff
of
orange
peel
tastes
of
grainy
malts
wheaty
and
grassy
lots
of
spicy
hops
a
little
citric
and
yeasty
with
a
clean
spicy
finish
even
though
it
isnt
particularly
high
in
abv
ther
is
some
alcohol
in
the
finish
soft
and
bubbly
with
lots
of
carbonation
to
tickle
the
tongue
and
a
dry
finish
light
and
crisp
refreshing
and
easily
drinkable
a
fine
beer
very
drinkable
easy
drinking
delicate
and
clean
this
biere
de
garde
is
missing
the
funkiness
and
complexity
of
the
best
saisons
however
this
beautiful
hazy
bottleconditioned
golden
northern
french
ale
delivers
sweetish
honeylike
malt
tempered
with
mustiness
and
some
cork
but
no
brettanomyces
barnyard
horseblanket
etc
the
appearance
is
quite
nice
and
it
leaves
some
decent
lace
the
body
is
mediumalmostbecomingfull
which
matches
its
malty
flavor
its
lively
effervescence
however
is
refreshing
and
helps
to
balance
the
malt
as
its
bitterness
is

as
to
forget
to

the

on

at
neighborhood
in

very
enjoyable
my
first
venture
in
the
style
i
will
try
others
theres
a
funky
aroma
to
it
thats
contrasted
with
a
lightness
on
the
palate
bit
of
a
funky
funk
finish
but
overall
not
terribly
complex
and
not
one
id
try
again
for
the
price
pass
jd
notes
nice
sweetfunk
flavors
but
not
dynamic
the
beer
does
get
much
better
and
more
balanced
as
it
warms
however
and
i
had
to
give
this
some
time
to
start
to
appreciate
it
im
fairly
new
to
this
style
and
this
is
a
classic
so
ill
give
it
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
for
now
dmalt
foward
and
simple
nothing
wrong
with
it
but
nothing
at
all
that
makes
me
want
to
come
back
drinkability
sways
a
bit
to
the
sweet
side
for
a
beer
of
this
style
but
still
has
a
nice
balanced
character
a
rather
unusual
flavor
profile
and
a
beer
well
worth
seeking
out
delicious
and
strong
this
aged
belgian
amber
ale
is
often
misunderstoon
and
unfortunately
so
though
a
saisonlike
brightness
and
dryness
is
prefered
this
on
falls
just
on
the
sweeter
side
of
the
dominant
beers
of
its
style
mouthfeel
was
medium
in
body
there
was
plenty
of
zip
but
finished
smooth
drinkability
excellent
could
be
classified
as
an
amber
ale
but
its
much
more
full
a
great
beer
d
ok
very
mild
could
be
good
with
some
good
foods
worth
a
try
and
could
make
a
good
pairing
overall
run
of
the
mill
and
a
fair
representation
of
the
style
not
a
stand
out
in
my
mind
but
good
in
its
own
right
the
price
was
great
if
that
makes
up
for
anything
5
for
the
750ml
d
i
bought
this
a
year
ago
and
have
cellared
it
until
now
i
just
wished
i
had
opened
this
sooner
nice
on
a
cold
day
but
i
imagine
this
to
be
great
on
a
fall
evening
as
well
dont
let
the
slightly
sour
scare
you
away
out
of
a
750ml
corked
and
caged
bottle
pours
a
rich
copper
color
with
a
fluffy
offwhite
head
that
settled
into
a
nice
cap
the
aroma
is
quite
faint
i
pick
up
some
buttery
caramel
malt
the
taste
is
very
smooth
what
i
expect
a
biere
de
garde
to
taste
like
a
nice
caramel
malt
with
the
slightest
hint
of
butter
along
with
some
mineralrust
flavors
and
low
bitter
hops
the
brew
has
a
moderate
feel
with
airy
carbonation
finishes
malty
sweet
but
in
no
way
cloying
again
very
smooth
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
the
flavors
dont
blow
me
away
typical
of
the
style
but
this
seems
to
be
one
of
the
better
samples
of
the
style
i
dont
remember
what
i
paid
for
this
if
i
saw
it
again
for
10
or
less
id
grab
it
in
a
second
great
authentic
stuff
overall
wow
biere
de
garde
has
never
been
a
favorite
sytle
of
mine
but
this
one
could
totally
turn
that
around
many
biere
de
gardes
just
have
that
slight
something
that
if
changed
would
make
it
great
well
this
one
has
that
something
a
great
biere
de
garde
mfd
goes
down
very
smooth
not
much
carbonation
a
good
medium

overall
i
would

it
is

all

this

with

the
flavor

and
some
acceptable

uninteresting
malt
the
blend
of
flavors
is
pleasant
but
the
beer
is
somewhat
disappointing
overall
my
score
seems
a
bit
high
considering
i
wouldnt
recommend
it
the
beer
is
too
sweet
and
watery
for
me
ultimately
the
malt
flavor
is
somewhat
uninteresting
on
the
other
hand
this
is
the
kind
of
beer
that
i
would
enjoy
trying
in
its
home

this
refrigerated
at
the
local
bevmo
the
deep
amber
hue
nicely
accompanies
the
lightly
effervescent
brew
very
lightly
hopped
and
not
as
sweet
as
a
belgian
the
wife
liked
the
nose
liked
it
but
for
the
price
would
head
towards
a
similarly
priced
belgian
dubbel
d
highly
drinkable
serving
type
bottle
a
pour
of
this
is
ok
but
one
is
enough
d
the
malt
flavors
are
powerful
and
while
they
are
accurate
to
the
style
they
border
on
overpowering
and
kind
of
hurt
the
drinkability
of
the
beer
aside
from
malt
there
is
not
much
going
on
here
and
i
would
like
to
see
a
bit
more
complexity
in
a
farmhouse
beer
if
you
see
this
dulllooking
bottle
on
the
shelf
buy
it
pours
a
dark
amber
in
the
tulip
with
a
frothy
top
light
aroma
with
some
citrus
and
hop
tones
a
floral
malty
start
that
continues
throughout
hops
are
subtle
which
gives
it
a
pleasant
sweetness
its
a
citrus
texture
on
the
mouthfeel
this
would
probably
go
great
as
a
desert
beer
after
some
sushi
verdict
a
complex
ale
that
doesnt
fail
i
have
no
idea
why
i
was
avoiding
it
all
along
the
best
example
ive
had
so
far
of
this
style
served
from
the
bottle750ml
this
pours
a
hazy
reddish
amber
color
with
a
small
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
and
minimal
lacing
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
slight
but
malty
the
taste
is
complex
with
lots
of
frutiy
flavors
present
especially
cherry
and
raisin
along
with
a
toffee
or
butterscotch
maltiness
this

pours
a
handsome
no
gorgeous
copper
color
with
plenty
of
generous
head
even
when
poured
slowly
the
nose
is
extremely
complex
clay
soil
caramel
butter
farmland
and
fresh
aromatic
hops
are
all
in
there
along
with
some
more
elusive
intangibles
that
are
conjuring
up
all
sorts
of
images
of
rural
europe
for
me
on
the
tongue
the
caramel
sings
out
with
a
spritzy
edge
the
hops
keep
it
interesting
and
the
butter
moves
to
the
forefront
but
what
really
does
it
for
me
is
a
slight
sour
twist
towards
the
end
reminiscent
of
those
flemish
ales
that
ive
recently
fallen
in
love
with
such
as
duchesse
de
bourgogne
this
says
to
me
drink
with
food
much
better
than
castelianchti
as
far
as
im
concerned
take
it
for
thanksgiving
dinner
drinkability
not
bad
at
all
nothing
jumps
out
as
being
great
or
spectacular
but
definitely
quaffable
and
quite
easily
sessionable
im
sure
always
hesitant
by
trying
french
brews
but
in
this
case
they
proved
me
wrong
750ml
bottle
poured
in
a
mug
mouthfeel
had
a
bit
more
fullness
to
it
than
i
would
have
though
by
simply
looking
at
it
it
is
certainly
full
bodied
and
rather
heavy
all
things
considered
anyway
nevertheless
i
found
it
quite
drinkable
and
will
certainly
pick
up
another
2
or
3
750s
to
have
on
hand
a
lovely
surprise
indeed
drinkability
this
is
a
great
drinker
not
too
big
with
alcohol
malty
enough
to
have
enough
balance
if
this
came
in
6
packs
i
would
drink
this
again
and
again
beer
for
keeping
but
good
fresher
as
well
i
guess
i
would
call
this
a
drinkable
sweet
session
style
beer
not
my
cup
of
tea
though
an
interesting
beer
but
not
one
that
i
will
likely
try
again
it
is
ok
but
rather
expensive
and
just
not
that
spectacular
a
beverage
overall
ive
really
been
getting
into
saisons
of
late
and
this
one
is
a
nice
take
on
a
light
summer
drinking
ale
a
bit
darker
and
hoppier
than
a
saison
still
very
good
in
its
own
right
id
have
no
reservations
buying
several
more
of
these
to
sip
on
a
hot
day
on
a
side
note
on
doing
some
research
on
bénifontaine
france
where
this
beer
is
made
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
it
is
brewed
in
a
very
small
town
in
northern
france
with
a
total
population
of
278
1999
im
not
going
to
write
home
about
it
but
if
i
were
in
europe
and
discovered
this
pouring
from
casks
in
a
small
cafe
i
would
never
leave
perhaps
that
really
isnt
about
the
beer
i
prefer
this
one
to
a
lighter
biere
de
garde
such
as
jenlain
or
gavroche
even
castelain
blond
now
if
i
was
cooking
there
is
a
lot
to
be
done
with
a
pale
saisonstyle
ale
pork
chops
anyone
while
st
amand
might
overload
the
caramelized
flavor
save
this
one
for
sipping
and
enjoy
thoroughly
for
the
style
this
one
is
dark
to
me
and
im
loving
every
bit
of
it
reminiscent
of
an
esb
with
characteristic
belgian
touches
if
anything
i
would
rate
this
higher
in
the
future
but
none
of
the
individual
characteristics
leapt
out
at
me
overall
drinkability
is
average
for
me
but
i
dont
think
id
turn
it
down
i
do
like
the
nose
quite
a
bit
drinkability
depends
could
be
refreshing
or
bland
depending
on
your
expectations
i
was
hoping
for
a
bit
more
character
but
it
was
pleasant
enough
and
a
fairly
good
value
it
is
an
enjoyable
beer
my
favorite
of
the
style
to
date
is
jenlain
and
this
one
is
very
similar
perhaps
a
bit
lighter
in
mouthfeel
and
in
flavor
intensity
good
stuff
drinkability
i
am
not
a
fan
of
this
ale
the
malts
are
too
strong
and
the
wild
tastes
id
expect
from
a
biere
de
gardesaison
is
nowhere
to
be
found
my
girlfriend
likes
it
so
i
probably
will
buy
it
again
and
who
knows
maybe
the
next
one
will
have
a
bit
more
to
it
i
was
for
some
reason
not
ready
to
be
impressed
by
this
beer
but
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
a
great
summer
beer
that
shouldnt
be
saved
for
summer
alone
the
body
is
pale
and
thin
and
like
the
taste
it
sorely
lacks
the
structure
malt
should
provide
it
is
certainly
downable
but
in
the
wake
of
classics
like
3
monts
la
baviasienne
or
even
castelains
namesake
biere
des
garde
this
seems
pretty
vapid
and
unispired
overall
this
beer
has
some
of
the
qualities
of
a
quad
combined
with
a
much
lighter
style
and
therefore
is
somewhat
of
an
enigma
nice
beer
worth
the
fun
and
effort
in
reviewing
it
im
not
sure
if
my
bottle
was
old
or
what
but
i
picked
up
some
very
different
things
than
the
other
reviewers
the
nose
was
very
pleasant
with
hints
of
fruit
coriander
and
lots
of
sherry
the
taste
reminded
me
of
a
flanders
red
ale
that
i
have
had
except
that
the
flavor
was
only
about
13
as
strong
there
were
other
flavors
in
there
as
well
maltiness
maybe
the
slightest
hint
of
saaz
and
the
classic
belgian
esters
this
beer
was
fantastic
and
if
it
was
a
fluke
it
would
be
too
bad
ill
try
it
again
if
i
ever
run
across
it
pours
a
deep
orange
with
a
big
fluffy
head
that
leaves
a
light
amount
of
lacearoma
is
light
and
herbal
with
some
grassiness
a
real
hop
presence
for
sure
along
with
some
dry
biscuit
very
solid
a
straight
to
the
point
in
flavor
dry
cracker
like
flavors
with
a
mintyherbal
finish
that
lingers
nicely
i
also
notice
just
a
little
sweet
caramel
intermingling
in
there
as
well
but
its
light
a
very
nice
ale
a
easy
quaffer
glad
i
tried
it
a
good
tasty
beer
not
complex
but
an
excellent
session
brew
or
a
simple
and
flavorful
accompaniment
to
dinner
a
bit
thin
bodied
i
thought
but
refreshing
and
very
drinkable
with
the
appropriate
meal
the
st
amand
is
another
winner
for
me
first
glass
is
clearish
later
ones
are
barely
sedimented
odd
light
chestnut
color
with
a
good
pale
yellow
head
that
doesnt
last
long
though
cottony
thin
string
lacing
on
the
glass
piquant
kind
of
aroma
almost
candied
cherry
and
rummy
light
body
with
generous
carbonation
very
fruity
berrylike
in
early
impression
switches
to
a
more
classic
maltier
tone
later
in
the
sip
reminding
me
of
maple
sugar
thin
but
distinct
metallic
hop
at
the
end
lingering
into
the
aftertaste
a
number
of
flavors
are
going
on
here
kind
of
a
wild
and
wooly
brew
from
a
caged
and
corked
750
ml
bottle
its
amber
with
a
somewhat
fizzy
offwhite
head
that
goes
away
quickly
leaving
no
trace
of
lace
the
smell
is
barnyard
funk
and
just
a
trace
of
fruity
sweetness
this
has
a
light
flavor
with
a
fair
balance
between
light
sweetness
and
a
touch
of
bitterness
on
the
finish
its
very
dry
and
satisfying
it
paired
well
with
some
spicy
haitian
chicken
and
beans
and
rice
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
a
thick
1
offwhite
head
over
a
clear
copper
brew
big
bits
of
foam
lace
throughout
the
drinking
experience
a
slight
sour
aroma
accompanies
the
malt
and
hops
smells
making
for
an
interesting
orchestra
taste
is
primarily
of
the
medium
caramel
malt
but
a
hops
crispness
is
present
throughout
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
effervescent
but
the
overall
package
seems
to
work
quite
well
disappointing
only
to
see
that
this
brew
isnt
more
widely
enjoyed
by
the
masses
this
beer
is
lightly
hazy
and
has
a
copper
color
the
head
is
a
light
tan
color
i
get
an
aroma
of
cider
and
as
i
go
deeper
into
the
aroma
i
get
lots
of
fruity
apple
scents
as
well
as
a
background
of
graininess
and
a
light
herbal
character
the
beer
produces
a
large
head
but
the
carbonation
is
relatively
light
this
is
mainly
a
light
refreshing
beer
up
front
it
has
a
bit
of
sweetness
which
carries
throughout
the
taste
profile
tastes
of
caramel
cider
a
bit
of
astringency
and
a
bit
of
plum
quite
clean
overall
basically
this
is
quite
simplistic
and
straight
forward
a
nice
refreshing
beer
another
interesting
french
brew
from
castelain
750ml
bottle
pop
the
cork
and
pour
a
nice
murky
golden
liquid
is
presented
with
quite
the
large
fluffy
white
head
aromas
are
of
belgian
malts
and
subtle
hops
on
the
finish
the
taste
is
mostly
malty
with
some
spiciness
and
citrus
fruit
appearance
in
the
middle
and
on
the
end
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
the
drinkability
is
nice
a
good
brew
but
one
of
the
least
complex
i
have
had
in
this
style
in
a
tall
belgian
bottle
with
a
flip
top
it
poured
a
dark
red
amber
color
and
formed
a
small
foamy
offwhite
head
that
left
trace
lace
as
it
subsided
a
small
amount
of
carbonation
is
present
an
aroma
of
malt
citrus
and
caramel
a
flavor
of
malt
citrus
and
caramel
fairly
light
body
for
this
style
but
rather
refreshing
with
a
light
finish
not
a
bad
beer
but
more
of
a
session
style
generous
pop
from
the
swingtop
grolschstyle
lid
poured
a
pale
copperyorange
highlighted
with
effervescent
whitish
head
left
a
nice
lacing
in
the
glass
when
finished
rather
weak
aroma
compared
to
some
other
biere
de
gardes
ive
tried
solid
qualities
reside
in
the
malty
flavor
mixed
with
herbal
undertones
with
a
slightly
tart
and
zesty
finish
definitely
better
in
the
flavor
than
aroma
worth
a
shot
if
youve
never
tried
it
smooth
on
the
tongue
and
the
malt
lingers
on
the
tongue
for
a
short
few
seconds
which
i
didnt
expect
with
the
heavier
body
enjoyable
and
a
fairly
easy
drinker
for
style
flavor
starts
out
mild
winelike
and
the
flavor
just
explodes
midway
through
the
sip
a
strange
nuttiness
big
fruity
belgian
candi
flavor
surprising
hop
presence
altogether
pleasant
this
is
a
hard
beer
to
forget
finish
is
rich
and
sticks
to
your
tongue
i
was
tasting
this
beer
even
through
the
beer
i
had
right
after
this
one
maybe
i
was
just
remembering
it
it
was
quite
splendid
sir
my
only
complaint
was
that
the
carbonation
was
so
intense
and
it
was
sort
of
filling
great
taste
less
filling
the
beer
pours
a
translucid
gold
color
the
head
prodigious
and
spumescent
the
lace
is
a
fine
covering
of
the
glass
both
a
bright
white
dominated
my
the
malt
citrus
crisp
or
somewhat
lemon
like
fresh
and
pleasant
start
has
a
distinct
malt
feel
lightly
sweet
the
top
middling
in
its
feel
to
the
palate
potently
acidic
the
hops
understated
but
noticeable
and
the
after
taste
as
dry
as
they
come
drinkable
and
something
worth
a
try
for
the
belgian
lovers
hazy
chestnut
color
loosely
gathered
foam
head
settles
to
a
steady
layer
aroma
is
fruity
largely
consisting
of
apple
raisins
and
plum
in
combination
with
the
steady
carbonation
the
flavors
and
crisp
texture
create
a
complex
array
sweet
tart
and
fruity
notes
freely
shift
about
the
palette
theres
also
some
woody
notes
and
the
yeast
imparts
an
underlying
musty
farm
character
a
fine
french
country
ale
and
a
delicious
brew
an
easily
forgettable
beer
this
beer
had
the
unlucky
position
of
being
rated
following
the
stone
imperial
stout
no
beer
should
follow
that
rating
this
is
the
first
brew
ive
tasted
from
brasserie
castelain
and
i
enjoyed
it
a
great
deal
it
poured
a
hazy
dark
ruby
in
color
with
a
off
white
rocky
head
that
faded
to
a
thick
ring
a
crisp
clean
candy
aroma
is
like
no
other
ive
smelt
before
the
sweet
fruity
taste
seemed
the
same
from
begining
to
end
a
little
thin
bodied
but
quite
drinkable
at
5

750
ml
flip
top
bottle
dark
amber
with
big
head
which
vanishes
if
you
ask
me
this
beer
is
identical
to
ruddles
county
ale
rich
malty
sweet
delectable
heavy
apple
cider
qualities
chewy
a
tiny
dead
bit
of
alcohol
in
the
middle
a
mild
dryness
and
a
little
bit
of
spice
denotes
the
hops
nothing
to
discern
it
as
french
or
even
belgian
no
present
yeast
i
guess
it
had
already
done
its
job
by
the
time
it
was
bottled
i
swear
it
tastes
just
like
ruddles
which
is
fine
by
me
ruddles
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
just
not
what
i
expected
from
a
biere
de
garde
perhaps
its
a
fraction
sweeter
and
lacking
the
creamy
british
mouthfeel
anyway
its
damn
good
maybe
even
tastier
than
ruddles
in
my
first
review
i
merely
rounded
it
up
as
a
french
alpha
king
nowadays
i
say
not
quite
but
almost
i
still
like
it
lots
though
light
amber
with
a
medium

hazy

by
a

the

is
a

and

is
ensued
by

and

the

to
yield
a
dark
mellow

the

bitterness
is
well
integrated
and
perfectly
offsets
residual

without
interfering

i
wish
that
of

it
stumbles
in

flavor

all

not

how
this

this
beer
doesnt

is

with

with
those
predominating
in
the
aftertaste
another
good
one
from
ommegang
ill
leave
it
at
that
o
a
fantastic
beer
but
i
should
mention
that
ommegang
produced
3
batches
all
in
2008
of
this
beer
and
not
all
are
created
equal
batch
3
has
fallen
off
more
rapidly
than
batch

d
the
more
i
drink
this
the
more
i
enjoy
it
i
had
to
change
a
few
scores
as
i
progressed
through
the
glass
this
is
so
smooth
and
balanced
that
it
should
be
a
crime
to
be
such
a
way
its
not
the
most
complex
nor
does
it
have
huge
flavors
but
whats
presented
is
nearly
perfect
overall
a
good
tasting
mild
sour
o
disappointing
from
the
word
go
this
makes
me
very
sad
a
wonderful
beer
but
far
from
my
favorite
ommegang
offering
id
rather
drop
my
dollars
on
some
hennepin
brisk
super
lively
carbonation
and
a
mediumlight
body
dry
finish
very
crisp
and
clean
drinking
excellent
overall
mouthfeel
for
this
style
a
terrifically
refreshing
beer
overall
a
solid
brew
ages
pretty
well
didnt
take
note
of
how
old
the
bottle
was
but
it
sure
wasnt
new
the
beer
was
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
fluted
glass
visually
the
beer
was
a
straw
yellow
color
with
a
bubbley
white
head
the
mild
apple
aroma
was
pleasant
though
it
did
not
overwhelm
the
senses
upon
the
first
taste
a
bubbley
sour
apple
flavor
was
noted
the
flavor
was
mild
and
faded
quickly
it
reminded
be
of
a
flavored
mineral
water
because
of
the
vanishing
fruit
flavor
overwhelmingly
potent
carbonation
helped
to
sweep
away
much
of
the
flavor
because
the
flavor
was
mild
to
begin
with
there
is
virtually
no
aftertaste
after
drinking
a
few
sips
the
carbonation
begins
to
build
in
the
chest
giving
the
unfortunate
urge
to
belch
like
a
middle
school
student
with
a
more
modest
level
of
carbonation
this
beer
could
have
been
more
enjoyable
d
unlike
any
other
bière
de
garde
i
have
ever
had
this
one
shows
balance
benefits
from
the
addition
of
brett
very
elegant
mature
compared
to
other
mass
produced
bdgs
like
gavroche
this
one
has
aged
exceedingly
better
overall
this
is
a
really
refreshing
drinkable
beer
ive
only
had
one
other
bière
de
garde
but
i
really
enjoy
this
style
overall
what
we
found
to
be
the
most
enjoyable
thing
about
this
brew
was
the
calming
brett
throughout
while
we
love
an
over
the
top
sour
or
unconventionally
yeasty
beer
ommegang
presents
an
even
well
balanced
brew
allowing
the
brett
to
integrate
rather
than
steal
the
show
perhaps
the
age
helped
to
calm
things
down
and
blend
it
but
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
for
someone
who
is
looking
to
get
into
things
with
a
little
funk
o
a
really
nice
dry
biere
de
garde
three
years
have
been
good
to
this
guy
o
i
like
the
taste
i
enjoy
aged
beers
like
this
the
fruits
in
the
beer
really
start
to
come
out
m
a
bit
dry
and
mildly
tart
on
the
aftertaste
despite
being
laced
with
brett
this
beer
is
real
easy
drinking
and
approachable
without
going
into
details
this
beer
may
have
suffered
due
to
age
there
were
some
interesting
notes
a
bit
of
the
sour
and
dank
from
the
brett
but
it
was
weak
i
had
this
with
some
traditional
holiday
fruit
cake
and
it
went
well
but
i
wish
the
flavors
were
less
muted
this
is
my
bad
i
cannot
blame
ommegang
for
taking
a
chance
on
such
an
old
batch
overall
as
others
have
noted
this
is
not
the
funkiest
of
brett
beers
still
it
has
a
nice
flavor
profile
and
with
three
years
of
age
has
matured
to
become
a
readily
drinkable
beer
the
aroma
was
light
hints
of
grian
light
hops
and
a
touch
of
light
peach
and
pear
fruit
notes
subtle
would
be
the
ideal
word
here
there
was
a
very
nice
flavor
here
nothing
really
huge
just
very
light
and
drinkable
nice
touches
of
light
grains
and
small
doses
of
light
fruit
mixing
well
and
with
subtle
yet
adequate
carbonation
i
desire
more
complexity
but
i
do
enjoy
this
one
im
interested
in
trying
a
fresher
bottle
to
see
the
difference
dr
extremely
drinkable
but
it
does
make
me
pause
to
enjoy
it
its
a
beer
with
character
brewed
with
care
and
really
well
done
i
could
drink
it
all
night
and
be
very
happy
the
abv
is
relatively
above
average
but
doesnt
come
through
in
the
taste
though
it
does
pleasantly
warm
me
stomach
all
around
this
a
great
beer
that
really
masters
the
style
and
will
be
enjoyed
by
any
true
beer
lover
im
unsure
of
the
price
as
i
didnt
purchase
it
but
i
imagine
its
rather
high
i
also
imagine
its
well
worth
it
sorry
ommegang
i
usually
love
you
guys
but
this
one
is
a
miss
mouthfeel
is
off
and
the
taste
is
nowhere
near
as
assertive
as
it
should
be
this
brew
poured
out
as
a
nice
looking
orange
color
the
head
was
there
for
a
little
while
but
faded
to
the
edges
of
the
glass
and
didnt
leave
much
lacing
the
smell
of
the
beer
had
a
little
bit
of
a
farhouse
aroma
to
it
but
also
had
a
light
sweetness
too
the
taste
of
the
beer
gives
off
a
slight
tart
kick
in
the
beginning
but
fades
into
a
really
subtle
earthy
flavor
in
the
end
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
and
had
plenty
of
carbonation
overall
i
thought
this
beer
was
really
nicely
done
mouthfeel
was
thin
and
light
with
a
semidry
finish
overall
this
is
not
a
wow
beer
but
there
are
just
enough
delicate
and
subtle
flavors
to
keep
you
interested
even
at
this
relatively
low
abv
i
did
expect
a
few
stronger
and
more
assertive
flavors
but
it
is
wonderfully
drinkable
so
i
have
no
problem
finishing
the
glass
next
time
ill
try
a
fresher
batch
to
compare
drinkability
another
solid
effort
from
ommegang
and
a
brew
especially
for
the
qpr
at
around
67
a
bottle
you
really
cant
go
wrong
here
quality
all
around
will
be
buying
a
few
of
these
next
time
i
see
it
o
subtle
mellow
and
well
integrated
i
really
enjoyed
this
on
the
softer
side
of
sour
this
is
a
nice
beer
to
introduce
people
to
brett
styled
brews
this
pours
a
nice
reddishcopper
color
with
a
large
white
head
which
quickly
dissipates
the
smell
is
vinegary
earthy
a
little
funk
feel
is
medium
nice
carbonation
taste
is
different
i
guess
its
the
brett
not
a
taste
im
familiar
with
i
was
expecting
a
sour
dutchess
type
of
beer
from
the
smell
and
i
get
a
hard
to
describe
dirty
earthy
taste
im
not
sure
what
to
take
from
it
it
does
have
a
nice
long
dry
finish
i
also
get
a
nice
sweet
flavor
which
counteracts
the
earthy
taste
overall
this
beer
isnt
bad
but
different
quite
a
bit
different
from
anything
i
can
remember
having
o
surprisingly
this
is
my
first
experience
with
this
beer
was
roaming
around
a
local
store
and
i
see
a
brett
fermented
beer
from
2008
how
could
a
funk
lover
resist
given
the
age
of
this
i
really
have
to
say
i
expected
a
lot
more
funky
character
in
here
there
certainly
is
some
brett
flavoring
in
here
but
i
was
hoping
for
a
bit
more
in
that
respect
i
found
this
a
bit
disappointing
other
than
having
dashed
hopes
a
bit
id
call
this
a
solid
if
not
outstanding
example
of
the
style
a
little
too
cidery
would
be
my
biggest
critique
overall
id
have
this
again
but
probably
wouldnt
buy
it
myself
unless
a
couple
years
from
now
i
see
another
bottle
of
the
same
batch
might
give
it
a
shot
to
see
if
the
brett
added
anything
more
to
it
o
not
bad
but
a
little
on
the
tame
side
from
a
flavor
standpoint
this
would
be
a
good
introduction
brett
beer
for
those
who
arent
sure
about
it
od
the
beer
is
a
bit
unbalanced
favoring
spice
and
funk
i
would
appreciate
a
bit
less
funk
a
little
more
subtle
fruit
sweetness
the
cpj
o
im
glad
i
tried
this
one
but
i
wont
be
mowing
people
down
to
grab
another
bottle
this
is
my
first
biere
de
garde
with
brett
used
so
i
wasnt
sure
what
part
it
would
play
the
brett
really
takes
the
lead
role
in
this
beer
hazy
orangeish
colored
beer
with
a
fluffy
white
head
brett
is
the
dominant
character
in
the
aroma
of
this
one
that
followed
by
a
little
fruit
and
malt
lots
of
funk
barnyard
earth
and
wild
esters
the
taste
is
similar
pepper
and
spice
a
bit
of
alcohol
some
bitterness
very
little
sweetness
and
no
real
hop
flavor
the
beer
is
medium
in
body
highly
attenuated
and
nicely
drinkable
a
very
cloudy
amber
color
with
a
healthy
offwhite
head
and
decent
but
spotty
lacing
the
aroma
offers
a
sharp
but
pleasant
cherry
sweet
tarts
with
a
sour
apple
element
the
first
mouthful
has
much
the
same
though
its
not
particularly
sweet
its
a
somewhat
grassy
acrid
thing
with
a
sort
of
chalky
rhubarb
idea
carbonation
is
very
prominent
sodaesque
feel
with

drinkability

of

i
much
prefer
their
ommegeddon
ale
which
brings
the
brettanomyces
character
to
the
front
there
are
interesting
characteristics
in
this
beer
a

spicy
and
a

taste
is
good
this
is
fantastically
drinkable
and
quite
well
balanced
and

right

a
very
enjoyable
beer
even
if
i
do
find
myself
wishing
for
a

of
those

that
i
could
have
paid

is
better

only
on

the

this
is
a
delightful
new
beer
in

really
feels
like

belgian
yeast
thrown
at
it

the
grains
in

beer
provide
a
rich
rye
wheat

oat
texture
with
a
little
oat
slickness
m
as
the
head
implies
the
beer
has
a
strong
carbonation
which
makes
for
a
really
great
mouthfeel
o
a
very
solid
beer
worth
trying
not
the
most
complex
biere
de
garde
ive
had
but
a
very
good
introduction
to
the
style
o
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
pretty
nice
beer
and
i
thought
it
was
a
nice
example
of
the
style
it
felt
like
it
was
on
the
tamer
side
of
a
biere
de
garde
with
no
tartness
showing
up
but
it
did
have
a
fair
amount
of
that
malty
aspect
that
i
expect
from
the
style
this
beer
had
nice
drinkability
it
was
smooth
very
crisp
slightly
prickly
dry
on
finish
not
foo
filling
and
the
taste
did
a
nice
job
at
holding
at
holding
my
attention
i
think
two
would
be
my
limit
any
more
than
that
and
the
higher
carbonation
might
start
to
wear
on
me
what
i
like
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
appearance
and
mouthfeel
they
were
both
very
nice
and
i
thought
they
were
the
highlights
of
this
beer
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
that
the
taste
didnt
seem
as
bold
and
bright
as
the
aroma
i
think
thats
the
only
thing
i
would
want
to
change
i
might
buy
this
beer
again
when
in
the
mood
for
the
style
and
i
for
sure
wouldnt
turn
one
down
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
likes
malty
beers
with
belgian
yeast
it
has
some
decent
balance
to
it
all
in
all
i
liked
this
beer
but
i
didnt
love
it
with
just
a
little
work
it
could
be
a
great
beer
though
its
not
my
favorite
beer
from
brewery
ommegang
and
it
isnt
my
favorite
biere

it
falls
right
in
the
middle
of
the

beers

alas
this
was
something
was
different
and
in
no
way
up
my
alley
ommegang
rarely
misses
but
this
is
one
overall
its
quite
an
impressive
ale
delivering
a
brilliant
combination
of
a
belgianstyle
ale
with
a
maltier
harvest
ale
essentially
creating
a
bit
of
a
new
style
but
forget
that
its
the
richness
of
its
character

that
make
it

a
very
respectable
a
i
cant
profess
to
be
an
expert
in
this
style
as
ive
had
only
one
other
biere
de
garde
and
only
a
dozen
or
so
saisons
for
that
matter
but
i
knows
what
i
likes
and
ommegangs
scythe
sickle
is
one
farmhousestyle
ale
that
i
am
really
digging
a
great
brew
that
all
fans
of
pale
belgian
styles
and
farmhouse
ales
should
consider
worth
seeking
out
and
given
the
fact
that
this
bottle
is
over
a
year
old
it
holds
up
quite
nicely
in
the
shortterm
too
kind
of
wish
id
bought
six
of
them
now
good
shot
at
the
style
well
worth
a
try
i
would
consider
buying
this
again
this
is
a
wellbalanced
ale
leaning
slightly
to
the
malt
it
is
just
a
little
too
malty
to
be
really
refreshing
but
is
not
bad
at
all
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
14
oz
pint
glass
pours
golden
orange
with
a
fluffy
white
head
smells
of
wheat
and
slight
belgian
yeast
tastes
of
wheat
and
some
sweet
spiciness
beer
is
heavily
carbonated
finishing
nice
with
a
light
body
overall
a
very
good
beer
overall
i
like
it
a
lot
there
are
certainly
good
characters
to
it
and
while
its
lighter
and
less
interesting
on
the
palate
that
it
ideally
could
be
its
certainly
still
flavoursome
a
drinkable
beer
that
retains
its
class
this
is
just
a
fabulous
mouthfilling
complex
rich
celebratory
ale
try
it
you
will
like
it
so
i
think
this
is
my
favorite
of
this
style
but
it
makes
me
want
to
try
more
high
b
i
remembered
this
being
better
in
a
5
oz
sample
but
maybe
i
had
too
much
then
slightly
disappointed
from
ommegang
i
tried
to
pour
it
to
the
exacting
standards
proscribed
on
the
bottle
but
did
not
balance
the
the
gentleness
required
to
avoid
upsetting
the
yeast
with
the
vigor
to
evenly
distribute
the
sediment
and
ended
up
with
an
impressively
large
head
that
had
long
lasting
retention
and
released
a
pleasant
bouquet
that
highlighted
the
unique
combination
of
a
surprisingly
large
variety
of
hops
i
enjoyed
the
sweet
taste
yet
there
was
a
slightly
astringent
mouthfeel
that
i
can
only
attribute
to
the
presence
of
rye
an
enjoyable
beer
sipping
through
the
foamy
top
i
find
aggressive
carbonation
and
a
delicious
grainy
body
oats
must
provide
the
smoothness
on
the
palate
while
rye
provides
a
grainy
bite
lots
of
flavor
here
but
not
a
lot
of
hop
bitterness
nor
excessive
sweetness
but
the
yeast
has
developed
some
really
great
flavors
of
honey
and
cloves
here
would
drink
again
a
decent
biere
de
garde
that
even
with
its
rustic
spicy
and
complex
grain
bill
is
a
bit
too
sweet
for
my
liking
the
high
level
of
carbonation
is
a
bit
too
grating
on
my
palate
and
really
blows
out
a
fair
amount
of
the
diverse
grains
admittedly
beer
reviewing
is
inherently
a
subjective
thing
but
trust
me
when
i
say
that
objectively
speaking
ommegang
is
one
of
the
best
breweries
when
it
comes
to
consistency
and
quality
theyve
displayed
more
integrity
than
arguably
anybody
else
they
know
what
theyre
all
about
brewing
belgianstyle
ales
and
they
continue
to
be
the
leader
at
doing
so
scythe
sickle
is
in
keeping
with
their
prestigious
reputation
and
excellent
portfolio
overall
a
very
easy
to
drink
beer
thats
just
a
little
forgettable
o
a
really
good
almost
great
belgian
amber
ale
medium
body
with
high
carbonation
a
very
enjoyable
beer
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
but
still
a
solid
beer
again
from
ommegang
o
not
sure
id
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
this
beer
but
it
is
certainly
a
decent
enough
offering
easy
drinking
and
inoffensive
overall
a
very
tasty
satisfying
fall
beer
better
than
i
expected
this
is
an
okay
beer
but
very
very
yeasty
the
yeast
seems
to
overpower
the
grain
profile

it
seems
like
the
brewers
were
trying
to
achieve

overall
a
nice

but
not
something
i
would
seek
out
too
often
would
be
interesting
to
taste
closer
to
its
best
by
date
overall
i
wasnt
impressed
sour
flavor
but
with
plenty
of
spice
notes
in
the
background
lightly
hopped
to
give
it
a
more
malty
feel
not
as
dry
as
most

beers
moderate
body
but
with
a
very
high
carbonation
level
the
aftertaste
has
elements

o
finally
a

i
can
get
down
with
im
just

if
i

it

its

a
summer
day
overall
this
is
yummy
did
not
pickup
originally
then
i
found
out
it
was
a
bière
de
garde
and
i
went
back
and
got
some
love
this
style
very
nice
brew
pours
a
dark
slightly
murky
gold
with
a
huge
head
lots
of
lacing
phenolic
and
earthy
yeasty
smell
great
complex
grainy
taste
you
can
definitely
pick
out
the
sour
rye
and
there
is
a
bit
of
pronounced
wheat
character
as
well
bananas
and
cloves
obviously
barley
what
is
there
to
say
about
barley
what
youre
used
to
toasty
in
this
case
the
oats
are
less
noticeable
but
make
their
presence
known
a
little
bit
in
the
mouthfeel
lots
of
yeast
characteristics
too
earth
and
fruit
some
bitterness
from
hops
maybe
a
little
roasted
malt
bitterness
too
pretty
fantastic
well
carbonated
and
full
bodied
drinkability
is
fairly
low
this
is
a
sipper
not
a
session
beer
strong
and
heavy
and
i
know
fall
beers
should
probably
be
sessionable
oktoberfests
etc
but
still
this
is
an
awesome
fall
beer
id
like
to
have
some
of
these
on
a
cool
night
around
a
camp
fire
im
actually
tempted
to
try
something
like
this
as
a
homebrew
memorable
and
great
overall
excellent
excellent
scythe
sickle
is
the
type
of
high
quality
ive
come
to
expect
from
ommegang
perhaps
the
usas
best
belgianstyle
brewer
along
with
leann
follain
and
firestone
pivo
this
trio
are
three
new
to
me
excellent
beers
which
ive
tasted
in
the
last
two
weeks
which
are
easy
to
obtain
and
dont
require
a
golden
ticket
the
flavor
has
a
nice
malt
quality
which
brings
a
mild
toasted
flavor
when
combined
with
the
yeast
there
is
a
slight
fruit
tinge
from
the
yeast
which
brings
a
mild
datelike
dried
fruit
and
tropical
aspect
the
hops
are
mild
and
the
flavor
of
alcohol
is
mild
but
there
is
a
slight
phenolic
almost
metallic
hint
which
isnt
too
noticeable
but
there
and
the
dryness
of
the
finish
is
practically
to
the
bone
with
the
extremely
high
carbonation
which
is
almost
seltzer
like
with
a
mineral
carbonic
quality
overall
i
enjoyed
this
a
lot
and
it
is
very
good
for
the
style
i
would
definitely
drink
it
again
taste
of
semi
tart
belgian
yeast
malt
toast
and
citrus
lemon
pith
dusty
yeast
phenols
little
alcohol
flavor
somewhat
hoppy
woodsy
and
earthy
flavor
comes
forth
medium
bodied
feel
with
a
high
drying
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
very
good
ale
while
not
a
session
beer
this
would
be
easy
to
get
rid
of
in
a
sitting
since
it
only
came
in
4packs
while
part
of
the
duvel
family
of
beers
something
like
this
almost
needs
to
take
that
relationshop
and
turn
it
onto
its
head
duvel
should
be
part
of
the
ommegang
family
of
beers
as
this
was
better
than
its
european
counterparts
and
pushed
the
limits
of
whats
possible
as
an
autumn
seasonal
pleasant
surprises
are
why
i
drink
so
many
new
beers
and
this
was
no
exception
this
was
well
worth
seeking
out
and
a
joy
in
every
sense
of
the
word
and
most
importantly
proof
that
ommegangs
best
offerings
dont
necessarily
come
in
big
bottles
highly
recommended
o
so
this
is
farmhouse
bieredegarde
ommeagang
delivers
a
solid
12
and
this
is
extremely
good
beer
me
likey
similar
quality
to
other
ommegang
beers
well
made
bold
complex
taste
and
full
flavor

some

its
described
as

ale
definitely
not
your
typical
example
mouthfeel
is
medium

slightly
dry
with
heavy
carbonation
its
good
but
im
not
catching
the
autumn
beer
tiein
overall
this
an
exceptionally
well
crafted
beer
that
is
very
suitable
for
the
fall
season
i
really
should
give
this
an
even
higher
score
but
it
doesnt
do
enough
to
truly
grab
my
attention
ok
id
buy
it
again
some
squash
and
spice
flavors
are
developing
as
it
warms
o
a
very
enjoyable
offering
that
screams
fall
as
was
the
point
othis
is
a
unique
beer
for
its
subtlety
it
just
provides
great
aroma
flavor
and
feel
without
any
hoopla
really
nice
offering
overall
a
pleasant
sessionable
and
fruity
beer
with
mild
complexity
solid
and
tasty
though
a
bit
fruitforward
for
the
style
more
emphasis
on
the
malt
would
have
made
this
more
of
a
biere
de
garde
in
my
opinion
overall
very
good
very
drinkable
but
offers
a
pleasant
complexity
as
well
4
0
d
considering
the
lower
abv
this
is
a
very
flavourful
and
well
crafted
harvest
ale
deep
burnt
orange
in
color
with
hints
of
brown
with
the
expected
belgian
murkiness
poured
with
a
huge
frothy
foam
with
good
retention
that
left
tons
of
sticky
lacings
on
the
glass
grainy
malt
and
belgian
yeast
aromas
with
tart
fruitiness
in
the
background
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
bodied
with
aggressive
carbonation
earthy
grainy
malt
fla
or
uo
front
with
a
hint
of
rye
belgian
yeast
flavors
through
the
middle
followed
by
slighty
tart
underripe
banana
toward
the
end
finishes
with
a
hint
of
rye
and
lingering
belgian
yeast
aftertaste
the
body
is
a
little
bit
on
the
thinner
side
although
not
thin
enough
to
be
swallowed
like
water
but
the
drinkability
is
very
high
on
this
one
perfect
end
of
september
going
into
october
seasonal
beer
the
pumpkin
aftertaste
sets
the
mood
for
a
great
fall
season
would
definitely
recommend
this
to
those
wanting
to
try
a
different
beer
this
upcoming
season
overall
a
surprisingly
complex
beer
i
didnt
love
it
but
enjoyed
trying
to
wrap
my
mind
around
it
overall
very
unique
and
interesting
brew
i
figured
i
mustve
been
mistaken
as
the
beer
falls
just
shy
of
6
how
could
that
light
of
a
beer
have
such
a
prominent
alcohol
note
apparently
this
is
the
norm
for
the
style
i
looked
it
up
cloudy
amber
golden
with
with
some
head
decent
retention
and
good
lacing
smells
a
little
peachy
and
bready
taste
reminds
me
of
anchor
steam
initially
but
with
a
little
note
of
honey
then
a
nutmegcinnamon
taste
comes
on
pretty
strong
before
fading
without
much
dryness
flavors
are
supple
and
complimentary
specialty
grains
and
an
understated
hop
character
that
lends
some
light
bitterness
mildly
toasty
with
a
brief
hint
of
sweetess
upfront
moving
into
a
dry
finish
with
a
duvel
yeast
aftertaste
overall
it
was
good
though
not
wildly
unique
ommegang
has
hit
an
absolute
home
run
with
this
style
its
french
in
character
and
complex
in
delivery
just
enough
earthiness
really
sells
its
taste
but
still
its
not
as
charming
or
distinctive
as
in
could
be
more
straw
character
higher
dryness
and
even
dare
i
say
a
pep
of
butter
could
really
round
this
thing
out
overall
this
is
a
wonderful
and
fascinating
beer
that
seems
to
tell
a
story
with
its
characteristics
really
good
ale
especially
good
flavor
and
flavor
balance
very
enjoyable
and
worth
trying
flavorful
rousing
deep
complex
but
also
simple
in
its
approach
stylish
and
pretty
ommegang
hasnt
disappointed
me
yet
i
was
lukewarm
about
springing
for
the
fourpack
blindly
but
im
delighted
by
this
first
bottle
the
other
three
will
be
enjoyed
with
ease
overall
first
opening
this
beer
i
was
pretty
excited
ive
been
a
pretty
big
fan
of
the
brewery
lately
and
enjoyed
a
lot
of
their
releases
this
beer
didnt
disappoint
one
bit
first
noticeable
aromas
were
the
grainy
and
offers
a
different
and
bold
alternative
to
all
the
pumpkin
beers
about
to
hit
the
market
i
enjoyed
this
and
was
satisfied
to
try
it
out
i
will
have
again
and
will
definitely
recommend
to
a
friend
cheers
rjt
o
a
very
nice

take
on
a

pair
well
with
a
large

meal
pours
a
dark
hazy
orange
with
a
large
beige

and
taste
of

bready

with
some

bitterness
on
the
end
for

overall
a
very
good
and
flavorful
seasonal
brew
overall
a
very
nice
and
drinkable
beer
its
not
crazy
or
super
inventive
but
its
good
and
not
too
strong
nice
for
summer
afternoons
overall
even
though
i
had
this
beer
out
of
season
it
is
still
an
excellent
beer
cant
wait
for
autumn
to
come
around
again
and
have
it
in
season
another
excellent
offering
from
ommegang
o
one
unique
beer
another
cracker
of
a
brew
from
ommegang
scythe
and
sickle
is
definitely
a
belgian
beer
for
autumn
would
go
well
with
autumn
foods
and
thanksgiving
dinner
get
this
seasonal
when
it
comes
out
its
definitely
one
to
try
o
another
great
and
complex
belgianstyle
ale
from
ommegang
this
is
a
perfect
pairing
for
the
thanksgiving
dinner
next
time
it
comes
around
that
is
i
consumed
this
beer
out
of
season
but
not
out
of
code
it
would
make
an
excellent
compliment
to
a
hearty
meal
on
a
cool
fall
day
but
it
is
still
very
enjoyable
even
on
a
warm
day
in
late
spring
its
also
a
welcome
change
of
pace
from
the
mediocre
ambers
and
octoberfests
that
flood
the
market
in
the
fall
o
this
is
an
ideal
brew
for
the
fall
season
will
definitely
seek
this
out
when
its
rereleased
this
may
be
the
first
time
ive
sampled
this
style
solid
brew
a
fresh
addition
to
the
harvest
ale
collection
similar
to
some
other
styles
but
different
enough
to
be
its
own
will
be
sampling
more
of
this
style
for
sure
o
i
was
really
hot
on
this
the
first
few
times
i
had
it
but
thats
evolved
into
more
of
a
casual
friendship
this
isnt
ommegangs
worst
12
oz
single
but
its
in
my
bottom
few
this
one
pours
a
medium
bodied
and
very
smooth
cloudy
amber
in
color
with
a
two
finger
bright
white
and
creamy
two
finger
head
the
nose
is
soft
with
nice
spicing
moderate
dark
fruit
some
malty
sweetness
and
belgian
yeast
it
kind
of
smells
like
a
smaller
spicier
dubbel
the
flavors
are
spicy
and
fruit
forward
upfront
with
a
lot
of
fig
and
date
influence
ot
almost
has
an
old
fashioned
cola
like
flavor
as
well
there
is
a
slight
yeast
character
but
it
isnt
as
dominant
as
in
some
of
the
other
ommegang
beers
which
probably
serves
this
one
best
it
drinks
medium
in
body
and
off
dry
it
has
nice
flavor
and
is
a
standout
for
a
biere
de
garde
in
my
opinion
at
5
8
this
is
a
belgian
ale
capable
of
drinking
a
few
of
overall
this
is
a
fine
biere
de
garde
and
a
very
nice
interpretation
of
the
style
with
unique
spicing
if
youre
a
fan
of
dubbels
this
would
be
right
up
your
alley
o
this
beer
has
a
nice
toasted
malt
and
earthy
grain
flavor
with
great
cellar
character
making
is
a
bit
mysterious
yet
complex
and
sessionable
at
the
same
time
overall
a
very
good
brew
very
enjoyable
gladly
will
buy
again
has
that
classic
ommegang
essence
o
pretty
tasty
enjoyable
beer
but
nothing
particularly
stands
out
about
it
that
being
said
i
would
definitely
have
another
88
b
pleasant
satisfying
brew
a
small

above

a

belgian

another
quality
brew
from
ommegang
picked
up
a
single
from
euromarket
for
about
3
its
poured
orangeamber
with
little
floaties
and
a
longlasting
white
head
the
beer
is
surprisingly
dry
and
bitter
but
i
guess
thats
appropriate
theres
a
big
spicy
peppery
finish
with
orange
peel
and
light
caramel
up
front
the
aroma
is
fruitier
with
a
little
pear
and
apricot
over
doughy
grain
and
toast
it
is
an
earthy
herbal
belgian
and
it
really
needs
to
warm
to
cellar
temp
for
the
edgier
notes
to
balance
out
its
certainly
interesting
but
i
might
not
want
to
go
through
an
entire
6pack
still
glad
i
tried
it
poured
a
clearish
gold
with
reddish
tints
with
a
solid
head
and
lace
combo
earthy
piney
wet
resiny
hops
are
prevalent
and
so
is
the
rye
malt
bready
as
well
getting
very
little
sweetness
and
wheaty
yeast
tones
but
theyre
in
there
light
to
medium
bodied
with
a
mix
taste
of
the
rye
that
gives
it
a
fuller
body
and
that
bready
edge
as
well
along
with
some
fluffy
yeast
and
floral
hops
as
well
as
mild
sweetness
easy
passing
beer
that
hits
all
the
notes
and
is
a
great
beer
to
session
as
well
overall
its
a
decent
amber
but
a
bit
uninteresting
and
pricey
at
11
per
4
pack
this
is
a
decent
beer
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
this
beer
but
if
it
is
on
tap
or
on
a
menu
i
would
try
it
out
overall
this
a
hearty
ale
that
has
just
enough
spiciness
that
makes
it
interesting
easy
to
quaff
definitely
a
different
style
for
a
harvest
ale
o
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
im
not
always
a
fan
of
the
style
but
i
like
this
quite
a
bit
for
the
price
id
easily
pick
this
up
again
and
recommend
it
to
others
overall
nice
fruity
and
spicy
brew
i
was
surprised
i
was
able
to
get
the
earthiness
out
of
this
one
which
is
well
pronounced
in
the
finish
complex
and
dynamic
a
must
try
this
is
a
cozy
beer
suitable
for
cuddling
on
a
cool
night
by
the
fire
the

season
is
captured

i

the

rye
were
a

louder
its
almost
to
clean
for
my
liking
but
obviously
its
and
very
well
made
beer
just
a
bit
lackluster
imo
o
overall
grainy
toasty
yeasty
and
of
course
cleanly
brewed
providing
for
multiples
this
tastes
a
lot
like
a
belgian
tripel
without
the
citrus
zing
it
has
more
of
a
sweet
caramel
malt
start
with
pepper
and
cloves
playing
up
the
rear
and
lingering
momentarily
on
the
palate
i
am
not
sure
if
i
would
call
it
a
harvest
ale
but
it
is
quite
tasty
no
matter
how
you
define
it
overall
a
superb
try
its
a
great
brew
to
sample
but
not
one
i
am
going
to
session
but
then
i
dont
session
anything
anymore
except
samplers
so
im
going
with
giving
this
one
a
score
of
94
overall
due
to
the
pour
and
the
taste
glad
i
tried
it
will
recommend
it
to
others

a
partly
cloudy

the
aroma
of
the
belgian
yeast
the
predominant
aromas
are
apricot
clove
white
pepper
and
a
touch
of
baseball
glove
leather
the
taste
is
mildly
sweet

more
fruity
sweetness
than
sugar

mildly
tart
and
softly
bitter

the
grains
show
up
in
the
finish
although
i
would
say
the
taste
is
more
of
raw
grain
than
cooked
or
roasted

the

pleasant
beer
that
really
tastes
at
around
55
degrees
f
a
very
approachable
brew
from
one
of
my
favorite
american
breweries
overall
this
to
me
tastes
like
an
above
average
to
average
slightly
sweet
biere
de
garde
not
much
stands
out
to
me
about
this
yes
it
is
good
and
i
would
not
turn
it
down
however
i
will
not
rush
out
to
get
another
either

this
really
is
a
fantastic
brew
so
subtlely
complex
and
balanced
a
true
pleasure
to
drink
ommegang
adds
another
amazing
beer
to
an
already
exceptional
lineup
of
offerings
this
isnt
too
bad
its
mostly
like
a
hoppier
trippel
i
would
have
loved
to
see
more
rye
in
here
cloudy

are

a
little

thin
film
retains
and
leaves
some
soapy
head
around
the
interior
of
the
glass
no
complaints
about
the
carbonation
or
body
and
i
love
the
bitter
residuals
left
behind
o
this
is
an
amazing
brew
i
dont
see
it
as
a
biere
de
garde
but
it
it
so
good
o
a
good
example
of
the
style
overall
4
0
honestly
im
tempted
to
bump
this
up
to
4
5but
its
not
nearperfect
its
more
like
a
4
25
overall
very
smooth
with
more
complexity
and
depth
than
anticipated
for
the
size
of
the
beer
and
its
composition
is
very
nicely
done
for
the
style
i
could
see
this
being
an
excellent
pairing
for
a
wide
variety
of
foods
very
tasty
and
worth
picking
up
if
you
like
ambers
and
or
ommegangs
yeastiness
and
evidently
that
includes
me
d
very
drinkable
good
overall
balance
and
complexity
like
the
rye
this
is
just
another
really
good
beer
from
ommegang
very
reminiscent
of
a
belgian
pale
ale
its
a
classic
example
of
what
theyre
all
about
great
beer
o
not
the
most
familiar
with
style
taste
like
a
pale
ale
with
a
belgian
influence
and
a
lighter
body
than
an
apa
enjoyable
recommend
to
break
someone
into
belgian
beer
not
sure
i
get
this
one
nice
color
coppery
reddish
not
much
head
foamy
a
little
lacing
lots
of
malt
aroma
and
taste
some
citrus
hops
kind
of
laid
back
get
the
bready
taste
not
too
much
carbonation
yet
slightly
refreshing
good
drinker
for
a
fall
afternoon
but
i
dont
find
anything
special
about
it
perfectly
good
product
though
o
distinct
and
well
brewed
wish
id
bought
more
than
one
this
is
a
new
favorite
a
bit
of
a
toss
up
if
i
could
recommend
this
brew
its
distracting
in
appearance
and
mouthfeel
but
its
nose
and
flavors
draw
you
back
for
the
next
sip
this
brew
could
stand
to
be
better
blended
but
it
is
refreshing
once
the
carbonation
has
died
down
pours
a
murky
honey
orange
with
a
foamy

that
settles
to

around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
grain
and
some
earthy
grassy
and
herbal
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
slight
herbal
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
overall
another
great
offering
from
ommegang
overall
maybe
just
a
tad
too
tartdry
id
like
some
more
fruity
notes
but
its
still
another
winner
from
this
brewer
however
next
time
id
reach
for
some
of
their
other
brews
complex
refreshing
rustic
and
earthy

o
this
is
a
awesome
session
beer
good
flavor
and
good
abv
for
many
of
these
to
be
drank
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
nice
looking
orange
amber
color
with
a
haziness
to
it
the
retention
on
this
beer
is
pretty
good
as
well
as
some
lacing
on
the
glass
the
smell
of
the
beer
gives
off
some
earthy
malt
and
yeast
aromas
some
subtle
hops
aromas
as
well
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
malty
some
interesting
grain
flavors
in
there
with
some
hints
of
caramel
and
bitter
hops
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
very
drinkable
with
a
good
carbonation
overall
its
a
good
brew
not
my
favorite
from
ommegang
but
still
a
good
beer
to
try
pours
a
golden
amber
with
an
annoying
huge
frothy
off
white
head
lots
of
effervescence
and
good
lacing
belgian
yeats
stands
out
in
the
aroma
giving
off
some
spiciness
good
dose
of
clove
particularly
and
just
a
tease
of
some
bubble
gum
some
rye
and
oats
is
also
there
to
cut
into
the
spiciness
of
the
yeast
flavor
seems
super
simple
yet
there
seems
to
be
some
interesting
depth
behind
it
which
i
know
makes
no
sense
but
no
clue
how
else
to
describe
it
belgian
yeast
giving
off
some
of
that
spiciness
the
rye
and
oats
offering
some
graininess
and
a
bit
of
a
bitter
and
peppery
finish
good
stuff
a
lighter
mouthfeel
with
a
ton
of
prickly
carbonation
not
sure
i
need
that
much
carbonation
overall
a
very
nice
beer
very
sessionable
glad
i
gave
it
a
shot
overall
a
pretty
interesting
and
solid
tasting
beer
a
nice
mix
of
malts
spices
and
hops
has
some
bite
to
it
while
still
being
very
smooth

nice
golden

bready

malts
spicy
full
flavored
some
grassy
hops
in
the
finish
very
nice
o
this
was
ok
it
was
anything
spectacular
and
pretty
straight
forward
othe
caramel
and
grassy
notes
make
for
a
fall
beer
but
the
watery
poorly
carbonated
mouthfeel
was
a
major
turnoff
a
nice
little
fall
beer
a
little
watery
overall
yet
still
packed
with
great
malt
grain
and
hop
flavors
i
didnt
care
so
much
for
this
at
first
sip
but
it
is
hard
to
find
fault
once
you
slip
into
the
flavors
and
seductive
sudsiness
from
the
fourpack
bought
at
best
damn
beer
store
in
san
diego
scythe
sickle
is
a
nice
fall
beer
i
like
it
its
strong
earthy
grainy
and
breadlike
flavors
combine
to
make
a
really
nice
flavor
and
are
very
reminiscent
of
the
fall
season
its
good
stuff
if
it
lacks
anything
its
flash
i
happen
to
like
that
about
it
definitely
worth
grabbing
if
you
see
it
overall
im
really
impressed
with
this
beer
i
think
it
would
be
a
good
anytime
anywhere
beer
flavor
is
something
im
sure
i
have
had
numerous
times
before
but
everything
else
brings
it
up
oi
enjoyed
this
beer
quite
a
bit
i
did
not
find
a
ton
of
exotic
fruit
or
herbs
and
nobody
will
mistake
it
for
a
hop
bomb
iipa
or
monster
quad
but
the
oats
rye
etc
worked
to
produce
a
complex
and
interesting
enough
beer
to
drink
on
its
own
or
as
i
did
with
some
dinner
i
also
found
it
pretty
quaffable
you
could
have
more
than
one
all
in
all
a
nice
surprise
a
very
interesting
harvest
ale
and
a
fitting
nod
to
the
various
grains
of
the
harvest
and
the
ways
in
which
they
can
be
combined
skillfully
brewed
and
a
joy
to
drink

highly
enjoyable
offering
scythe

sickle
pours
out
an
orange
color
with
one
of
the
nicer
heads
ive
seen
in
a
while
the
aroma
is
spicy
earthy
and
yeasty
with
the
belgian
yeasts
and
the
rye
working
together
the
taste
is
heavy
on
the
yeast
at
first
perhaps
too
heavy
but
its
quickly
balanced
out
by
the
fantastic
spicy
earthy
and
grainy
malts
used
here
theres
a
strong
complexity
of
malts
thats
really
something
but
i
think
the
yeast
is
a
little
too
strong
here
not
a
major
flaw
this
is
still
a
very
good
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
lighter
and
a
little
confused
its
a
bit
sticky
yet
drying
the
drinkability
is
solid
overall
an
interesting
take
on
the
fall
seasonal
beer
that
is
really
close
to
greatness
as
it
is
now
its
still
quite
good
but
could
be
superb
with
just
a
little
more
refinement
on
the
yeast
character
notes
very
tasty
a
little
bit
like
a
tripel
but
not
as
many
alcohol
notes
cheers
o
this
beer
just
works
in
spite
of
how
hard
it
is
to
categorize
and
pick
apart
this
beers
finesse
and
moderate
complexity
helps
it
rise
above
the
average
marzencumpumpkin
ale
the
beer
pours
a
dark
goldenamber
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
dry
and
fruity
belgian
yeast
scent
that
compliments
a
pale
malt
dominated
aroma
its
brewed
with
wheat
oats
and
rye
as
well
which
aids
in
the
light
and
spicy
character
the
taste
is
decent
as
well
it
has
a
smooth
and
easy
drinking
malt
flavor
that
goes
down
quick
and
finishes
with
dry
fruity
yeast
character
the
rye
adds
depth
in
the
taste
while
contributing
a
spicy
flavor
that
works
well
with
belgian
yeast
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
mediumfull
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
decent
harvest
ale
but
nothing
too
exceptional
a
very
very
unique
beer
hopelessly
underrated
here
on
ba
it
pours
a
murky
orange
color
somewhere
between
brass
and
tangerine
with
a
bold
white
lace
on
top
a
few
inches
tall
it
smells
very
fruity
not
sure
if
its
fruit
juice
or
if
its
from
the
yeast
but
it
takes
on
an
almost
tropical
vibe
the
flavor
is
way
more
hoppy
than
i
expected
maybe
one
of
the
hoppiest
ommegang
beers
ive
had
its
bitter
citric
hops
and
they
are
all
in
the
finish
the
yeast
provides
some
musty
fruit
tones
while
the
malt
offers
a
late
hay
harvest
flavor
mouthfeel
is
fantastic
its
velvet
when
you
drink
it
with
very
bright
but
round
carbonation
not
prickly
at
all
finish
is
long
and
complex
contemplative
i
had
this
at
the
cheeky
monk
on
colfax
last
night
and
i
suggest
you
get
down
there
for
a
glass
of
this
before
its
gone
the
beer
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
white
head
i
get
a
lot
of
grain
notes
in
the
aroma
with
a
hint
of
yeast
and
some
grass
the
flavor
is
fairly
dry
with
a
lot
of
the
husky
grain
notes
i
also
get
some
grass
and
earth
from
the
hops
as
well
as
some
spices
and
some
yeast
medium
mouthfeel
and

overall
excellent
offering
from
ommegang
i
would
pick
this
up
again
if
i
came
across
it
downfall
is
that
it
was
rather
pricy
d
not
great
there
is
a
harsh
medicinal
note
that
covers
everything
else
and
really
hurts
the
drinkability
the
malt
character
is
bland
and
the
yeast
just
doesnt
work
which
means
the
beer
doesnt
have
much
going
for
it
toasted
grains
and
herbal
bitterness
up
front
soft
wheat
sweetness
bananas
and
cloves
follow
spicy

ommegang
hits
it
out
of
the
park
i
cant
believe
i
used
to
think
these
guys
were
overrated
well
done
all
around
good
beer
from
a
style
i
generally
dont
like
i
brewed
a
roggenbier
last
year
that
was
pretty
similar
to
this
i
wonder
if
ommegang
used

tons
of
creamy
off
white
head
leaving
a
fair
amount
of
lace
nose
has
a
sweet
lemony
base
to
it
with
a
fair
bit
of
spice
underlying
the
lemony
sweetness
notes
of
tangy
yeast
towards
the
back
with
a
soapy
hop
accompanying
taste
is
a
bit
less
integrated
with
the
sweetness
strong
the
spice
lingers
in
the
finish
with
notes
of
rye
bread
in
the
back
there
are
some
golden
fruit
notes
intertwined
throughout
body
is
medium
soft
and
smooth
nice
carbonation
and
semi
dry
poured
into
a
glass
mug
pours
hazy
copper
with
a
tall
white
head
and
numerous
tiny
bubbles
in
the
beer
the
head
dissipates
slowly
some
lacing
is
left
on
the
side
of
the
glass
during
consumption
there
are
prominent
fruit
ester
aromas
i
pick
up
apple
and
citrus
theres
some
spice
which
is
a
little
peppery
it
smells
more
like
a
saison
the
taste
follows
the
nose
i
pick
up
some
of
the
bready
malt
with
that
apple
and
citrus
flavor
theres
that
peppery
spice
in
the
background
that
could
be
coming
from
the
rye
its
definitely
tasting
like
a
saison
as
well
as
smelling
like
one
the
body
is
light
with
strong
carbonation
the
finish
is
smooth
and
sticky
the
aftertaste
just
coats
to
the
mouth
for
a
little
while
this
is
a
very
good
beer
overall
a
truly
amazing
and
complex
beer
i
should
have
expected
this
from
ommegang
but
i
am
truly
impressed
there
really
is
a
lot
going
on
in
this
beer
and
i
encourage
everyone
to
seek
it
out
definitly
a
departure
from
standard
fall
brews
and
better
actually
too
nice
beer
malt
forward
but
good
stuff
afterward
nice
bitter
balance
i
must
say
nice
to
find
the
biere
de
garde
in
a
12
oz
bottle
say
what
you
will
about
this
beer
i
love
ommegang
but
i
wasnt
gunning
for
this
to
be
a
superb
beer
before
i
tried
it
what
really
sells
me
is
the
attention
to
detail
complexity
and
ability
to
be
simultaneously
soft
but
remarkably
flavorful
and
deep
seems
a
little
redundant
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
coppertinged
tawny
topped
by
a
finger
or
so
of
light
tan
foam
the
nose
comprises
sweet
biscuit
light
toffee
sweet
flowers
clove
a
hint
of
cocoa
light
grass
and
a
pinch
of
brown
sugar
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
along
with
some
cracked
wheat
light
belgian
yeast
honey
a
lovely
bit
of
graham
cracker
character
going
on
here
light
vanilla
bean
faint
orange
zest
and
a
dash
of
black
pepper
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
slightly
creamy
feel
overall
a
surprisingly
highly
enjoyable
brew
one
that
shows
what
can
be
done
with
a
variety
of
grains
when
theyre
tamed
into
working
harmoniously
with
a
classic
yeast
strain
very
nice
i
find
this
to
be
a
terrific
beer
i
could
really
drink
this
one
year
round
havent
been
a
big
fan
of
many
of
the
ommegang
brews
ive
had
in
the
past
but
this
one
is
wonderful
great
surprise
for
me
o
i
like
the
contribution
of
the
rye
to
add
the
additional
spicy
flavors
to
this
beer
easy
to
drink
and
a
nice
autumn
beer
enjoyable
and
one
to
have
next
year
i
hope
this
stays
on
tap
for
a
while
at
pigs
fly
scythe
sickle
caught
my
interest
as
soon
as
i
saw
it
but
i
was
reluctant
to
pull
the
trigger
on
the
4
pack
after
picking
up
a
single
bottle
im
starting
to
think
i
should
have
picked
up
more
i
think
this
beer
will
age
out
very
well
i
would
cellar
this
one
for
a
bit
to
smooth
out
the
bitterness
and
alcohol
overall
one
of
the
biggest
surprises
for
me
in
months
just
a
great
beer
and
very
well
suited
for
the
fall
season
cool
new
lables
and
cool
new
brews
from
ommegang
poured
into
my
ommegang
chalice
a
brilliant
a
deep
orange
infused
lighter
amber
with
a
spot
on
one
finger
white
crown
that
left
multiple
chunks
of
lace
behind
as
it
settles
into
a
soapylike
mass
atop
toasted
grain
notes
in
the
nose
along
with
light
phenols
and
a
hint
of
pepperlight
aromas
but
decnet
enough
the
toasted
grain
comes
out
again
on
the
palate
with
a
little
phenolic
yeastiness
and
a
faint
shot
of
spice
from
the
rye
i
think
this
is
a
good
alternative
to
the
pumpkin
and
oktoberfest
fall
beers
out
thereits
not
in
your
face
with
big
flavors
but
a
smooth
easy
drinking
table
beer
i
could
drink
alot
of
this
o
an
excellent
changeofpace
style
from
the
glut
of
marzens
pumpkin
ales
and
oktoberfests
that
flood
the
market
this
time
of
year
that
said
im
not
thinking
biere
de
garde
so
much
as
i
am
belgian
pale
ale
here
but
its
still
a
quality
beer
nonetheless
the
5
8
abv
is
very
sessionable
and
the
delicate
fruity
and
floral
flavors
teased
from
the
carefully
handled
grains
shines
a
spotlight
on
the
craft
that
went
into
this
brew
o
an
interesting
beer
i
like
biere
de
gardes
and
its
nice
that
ommegang
put
it
in
a
12
oz
bottle
so
this
didnt
cost
10
to
try
they
should
do
that
for
all
their
releases
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
had
a
bottle
of
this
on
my
trip
back
to
ct
pours
a
bubbly
golden
color
nice
floral
aroma
medium
bodied
nice
creamy
mouthfeel
floral
notes
come
out
very
smooth
and
well
balanced
nice
solid
beer
a
good
change
of
pace
from
the
usual
seasonals
overall
this
is
a
fairly
decent
beer
but
nothing
too
exciting
the
phenolic
spiciness
and
husky
astringency
becomes
a
bit
grating
after
awhile
and
i
am
greatly
missing
the
complex
grain
bill
that
is
advertised
because
the
yeast
phenols
overshadddow
the
flavor
profile
this
is
a
superb
looking
beer
the
head
stands
tall
and
firm
three
to
four
fingesr
plus
one
and
a
half
above
the
rim
of
my
long
trail
brewmaster
series
glass
very
slow
fade
leaves
a
ton
of
lace
and
a
thick
covering
mostly
clear
light
brown
with
orange
hues
and
some
carbonation
activity
in
the
glass
smell
is
sweet
with
fruity
belgian
yeast
esters
and
bready
malt
some
light
floral
hops
and
bit
of
overripe
banana
spicy
notes
from
the
rye
carry
some
pepper
and
faint
cinnamon
roasted
grains
throughout
with
caramel
malt
and
light
toffee
taste
is
like
a
fall
version
of
rare
vos
deep
roasted
grain
maltiness
with
a
dark
fruit
sweetness
yields
to
a
belgian
yeast
with
earth
and
an
herbal
hop
bitterness
that
is
delicate
but
firm
lots
of
toffee
and
caramel
wrapped
in
mutigrain
dough
spicy
pepper
cinnamon
and
clove
finish
is
clean
and
dry
with
a
light
leafiness
lingering
in
the
mouth
just
a
touch
of
astringency
that
dries
the
mouth
nicely
feel
is
velvety
with
a
coating
carbonation
that
gives
a
soft
crispness
and
overall
quenching
quality
goes
down
so
easily
you
find
yourself
at
the
end
of
the
glass
in
seconds
it
seems
this
is
in
my
short
ist
of
most
memorable
beers
i
have
had
this
year
a
great
beer
for
any
occasion
and
a
perfect
compliment
to
any
seasonal
food
othis
is
actually
just
an
awesome
beer
i
rarely
get
a
well
done
variation
of
a
belgian
style
by
an
american
brewery
it
even
tastes
like
it
is
from
belgium
good
tastes
like
this
are
rare
at
a
decent
price
o
a
tasty
beer
worthy
trying
but
probably
wont
pick
it
up
again
coriander
really
ommegang
enough
with
the
coriander
already
is
extremely
prominent
in
the
flavor
its
the
first
thing
i
pick
out
and
it
is
the
most
persistant
flavor
well
through
the
finish
there
is
a
nice
drying
spiciness
on
the
finish
too
loads
of
carbonation
and
a
light
mouthfeel
make
this
relatively
hard
to
drink
just
because
it
foams
up
on
your
palate
so
much
its
alright
overall
i
wish
the
flavor
delivered
what
the
aroma
promised
overall
pretty
good
nice
belgian
dark
ale
typical
flavors
nicely
done
it
keeps
wanting
to
be
heavier
with
more
booze
but
the
booze
never
comes
and
i
kinda
want
it
to
now
maybe
a
double
version
of
this
for
winter
would
be
perfect
orange
bronze
in
color
with
a
thick
rocky
head
tons
of
lacing
around
the
glass
as
well
the
nose
is
soft
with
lots
of
floral
tones
and
light
citrus
hops
theres
a
good
amount
of
wheat
as
well
giving
it
a
sorta
dryness
wheat
and
citrus
upfront
in
the
taste
with
a
mild
caramel
sweetness
that
starts
off
in
the
middle
and
carries
to
the
end
simple
but
very
tasty
the
mouth
feel
is
extremely
soft
with
pleasant
carbonation
overall
a
really
great
beer
its
very
drinkable
not
terrible
complex
but
it
has
just
enough
character
to
keep
the
palate
interested
overall
these
guys
made
quite
a
good
beer
sure
its
not
as
sessionable
as
say
the
bpa
but
its
still
one
smooth
dark
ale
with
great
wheat
character
and
to
those
who
think
the
alcohol
is
heavy
and
cloying
man
up
o
a
bit
too
heavy
on
the
alcohol
taste
its
ok
but
could
use
some
aging
m
light
to
medium
body
good
carbonation
with
a
slightly
sticky
finish
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
tulip
glass
this
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
massive
foamy
white
head
which
has
good
retention
the
smells
are
of
fruity
yeast
esters
banana
grass
hops
the
feel
is
medium
high
carbonation
the
taste
is
pretty
good
some
yeast
esters
a
little
grass
hops
some
ripe
fruit
i
believe
the
style
listed
for
the
beer
might
be
steering
people
in
the
wrong
direction
this
beer
is
more
saison
or
farmhouse
than
any
other
style
tastes
like
a
belgian
ardennes
yeast
but
has
a
bit
of
saisony
pepper
to
it
o
overall
im
an
admitted
ommegang
fanboy
and
this
was
a
nice
surprise
based
on
the
mixed
reviews
i
enjoyed
it
thoroughly
distinct
ommegang
flavors
and
characteristics
belgian
dark
it
is
not
at
least
not
a
good
take
on
that
style
so
i
think
that
must
be
incorrect
but
as
a
beer
from
ommegang
not
their
best
but
far
from
their
worst
this
is
a
tasty
brew
and
if
you
like
ommegang
in
general
you
will
probably
dig
this
if
you
dont
like
ommegang
you
will
probably
not
like
this
as
it
really
carries
a
lot
of
their
vibe
seems
more
like
a
bière
de
garde
but
its
not
tasty
enough
for
me
to
care
if
the
listing
gets
revisited
o
this
is
an
enjoyable
beer
if
you
like
something
malty
with
belgian
yeast
and
some
spicy
rye
its
not
that
difficult
to
drink
and
packs
in
a
lot
of
flavors
overall
a
tasty
and
unique
belgian
inspired
ale
served
from
tap
into
a
trappe
door
tulip
poured
a
light
redorange
with
a
two
finger
offwhite
head
that
subsided
to
half
a
finger
very
slowly
maintained
phenomenal
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
earth
graham
cracker
grain
and
spice
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
grain
earth
graham
cracker
and
spice
it
had
a
medium
feel
on
the
palate
with
medium
carbonation
that
was
almost
chewy
overall
this
was
a
fairly
decent
brew
graham
cracker
where
did
this
come
from
while
i
was
rather
surprised
to
see
this
aspect
come
forward
it
just
didnt
seem
like
it
belonged
with
the
rest
of
the
brew
the
flavor
was
really
pretty
average
for
the
style
though
as
it
didnt
really
stand
out
at
all
for
me
i
was
hoping
for
a
little
more
if
i
am
honest
but
was
slightly
letdown
by
this
fact
not
sure
if
i
would
suggest
this
one
to
others
but
it
does
make
a
good
tick
o
a
good
easy
drinking
beer
with
interesting
belgiantype
yeasty
flavors
solid
overall
not
amazing
but
very
good
easy
drinking
i
like
the
hop
dimension
as
it
complements
the
belgian
yeast
flavor
i
could
drink
several
of
these
without
a
problem
slightly
hazy
pour
amber
color
with
a
sturdy
foamy
white
head
nice
retention
and
lacing
aroma
of
biscuity
malts
and
sugar
spice
and
undertones
of
fruity
esters
similar
taste
sweet
malts
and
a
dab
of
honey
clove
notes
of
banana
and
dried
stone
fruits
toasted
grains
herbal
hops
a
touch
medicinal
about
medium
in
body
moderate
carbonation
not
a
bad
beer
but
nothing
really
memorable
here
overall
a
very
tasty
beer
with
a
fantastic
feel
and
nice
flavor
transitions
and
tastes
it
is
definitely
one
to
try
if
you
get
a
chance
this
is
a
unique
beer
t
very
good
the
generous
barley
gives
it
some
fall
seasonal
character
with
great
traditional
belgian
characteristics
as
well
such
as
the
yeast
and
fruity
notes
overall
very
good
would
make
a
nice
addition
to
a
regular
rotation
of
favorite
everyday
beers
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
scores
well
with
me
but
this
doesnt
taste
like
a
harvest
ale
as
advertised
it
taste
like
a
belgian
ale
medium
body
nice
carbonation
sticky
and
easy
drinking
on
the
tongue
a
nice
drinking
beer
well
done
for
the
season
i
could
easily
have
a
couple
of
these
a
bit
underwhelming
in
the
mouth
though
the
bread
and
yeast
flavor
is
certainly
pleasing
theres
just
not
enough
of
it
a
light
sweetness
escorts
the
ghostly
hop
bitterness
like
a
quiet
couple
everyone
likes
milling
around
at
a
party
though
from
whom
no
one
expects
remarkable
conversation
o
really
happy
with
this
one
i
think
ommegang
did
a
great
job
crafting
a
harvest
time
beer
with
solid
notes
but
also
that
was
highly
drinkable
uniquely
ommegang
awesome
tastespicy
belgian
yeastlightly
toasted
malt
spicy
rye
dry
finish
very
tasty
almost
like
a
ryedup
hennepin
o
this
is
an
uneven
beer
i
certainly
would
not
classify
it
as
a
belgian
dark
ale
actually
i
dont
know
what
id
classify
it
as
a
decent
beer
but
not
spectacular
o
quite
refreshing
bottled
on
072512
overall
not
sure
if
i
would
consider
this
an
american
amber
much
to
belgian
to
be
in
the
same
category
as
other
reds
very
balanced
and
easy
drinking
but
not
sure
if
i
would
seek
this
out
overall
the
phenolic
spiciness
and
husky
astringency
becomes
a
bit
grating
after
awhile
pass
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
carbonation
being
above
average
overall
it
was
a
pretty
good
beer
they
really
highlighted
the
rye
flavors
nicely
which
i
really
liked
everything
else
came
together
pretty
well
and
it
felt
pretty
balanced
and
flavorful
overall
pretty
good
as
are
most
ive
tried
from
these
guys
not
the
most
sexy
style
of
brew
but
this
is
a
well
crafted
and
quality
new
offering
from
omme
o
a
decent
beer
certainly
easy
drinking
anything
from
ommegang
is
probably
worth
trying
d
good
drinkability
i
like
this
as
a
harvest
fall
beer
brings
in
many
different
grains
and
all
are
discernibly
present
with
none
taking
over
a
dominant
position
the
belgian
ommegang
yeast
seems
out
of
place
at
first
but
it
melds
together
the
more
i
get
through
the
bottle
not
my
style
but
a
decent
quaff
nonetheless
quite
an
enjoyable
beer
my
comment
now
is
i
am
going
to
get
another
recommend
you
do
the
same
thanks
ommegang
for
another
delicious
treat
o
this
was
a
tasty
sessionable
beer
and
overall
i
was
glad
that
i
gave
it
a
try
but
with
all
of
the
other
tasty
seasonal
beers
that
are
out
right
now
at
this
price
point
i
probably
wont
be
revisiting
this
anytime
soon
very
tasty
brew
kind
of
an
amber
saison
or
a
yeasty
biere
de
garde
another
winner
from
ommegang
o
nice
beer
ill
be
looking
for
this
again
next
fall
interesting
and
the
5
8
abv
makes
it
an
easy
drinker
if
you
run
across
this
give
it
a
try
o
i
enjoyed
this
beer
i
do
recommend
you
buy
it
as
soon
as
possible
and
drink
it
as
soon
as
possible
it
will
probably
lose
its
muster
as
it
sits
on
the
shelf
i
need
to
visit
this
brewery
interesting
my
first
foray
into
biere
de
gardes
i
can
see
the
parallels
between
this
and
the
belgian
saison
tradition
not
loving
this
slightly
tart
and
odd
love
the
blonde
but
this
is
just
a
little
strange
thiriez
amber
pours
a
clean
creamy
orange
amber
with
a
little
haze
and
a
2
offwhite
foamy
head
that
quickly
dissipates
caramel
and
fruity
notes
dominate
the
nose
augmented
by
spice
and
floral
notes
light
short
cake
covered
in
stone
fruit
and
a
trace
of
caramel
dominate
the
palate
with
a
moderate
hop
accent
on
the
finish
and
a
touch
of
tartness
for
balance
the
carbonation
is
superb
with
fine
soft
bubbles
that
give
a
luscious
mouth
feel
it
is
very
smooth
and
thirst
quenching
the
body
is
medium
overall
a
unique
cross
between
a
saison
and
a
flanders
oud
bruin
nice
o
this
beer
tastes
unique
for
a
french
bière
de
garde
because
its
a
little
sour
but
not
to
the
degree
of
a
jolly
pumpkin
beers
and
pleasantly
adds
an
interesting
twist
to
the
taste
it
is
quite
easy
to
drink
and
the
bit
of
sourness
also
masks
some
of
the
grainy
malts
and
earthy
yeast
a
decent
farmhouse
amber
ale
the
inherent
fruitiness
rolling
nicely
with
the
friendly
yeast
jabs
and
an
agreeable
varying
hop
bitterness
helping
keep
things
interesting
a
wee
bit
complicated
so
better
if
youve
the
time
to
sit
back
and
contemplate
otherwise
it
also
slips
down
alarmingly
fast
if
thats
your
bag
not
interesting
enough
just
too
sweet
and
a
bit
off
o
a
very
nice
biere
de
garde
perhaps
the
rich
malt
is
a
bit
too
much
for
some
i
loved
it
odfor
2
dollars
i
do
not
care
how
old
this
beer
is
judging
from
past
reviews
this
one
held
up
quite
well
during
its
extended
stay
on
the
shelf
very
different
adds
a
new
dimension
to
my
tasting
experience
d
this
bottle
went
down
very
easy
very
enjoyable
and
thirst
quenching
if
you
havent
tried
this
farmhouse
its
definitely
worth
seeking
out
and
trying
pours
a
very
hazy
amber
with
an
absolutely
massive
white
fluffy
head
head
persists
throughout
sticks
all
over
the
glass
aroma
is
very
musty
grassy
and
has
an
apple
fruit
sweetness
flavor
is
similar
to
the
nose
sweettart
apples
pale
mallt
sweetness
and
finishes
with
a
slight
metallicacidic
sourness
some
grassy
hops
in
the
finish
but
it
is
muted
by
the
yeast
spicefunk
character
that
is
associated
with
a
saison
llight
to
medium
body
well
carbonated
slightly
more
malt
forward
than
your
average
saison
but
this
one
is
still
very
refreshing
drinking
really
well
on
this
hot
dry
day
in
boston
overall
a
very
nice
bdg
one
of
the
better
examples
seek
it
out
d
nice

in

but
not
especially

the
bottle
went
down
pretty
easily
so
i
gave
it
better
than
average
marks
for
drinkability
its
just
a
little
sweet
and
juicy
for
more
than
a
couple
of
pints
taste
is
of
peach
carrot
juice
etc
not
very
pleasant
at
least
to
my
taste
looked
like
it
would
be
a
good
beer
but
its
not
ill
try
something
else

mdboth
are

although

drinkability
is
the
tits
can
you
ever
have
enough
no
i
want
to
suck
on
this
all
night
and
a
have
some
more
when
i
wake
up
pours
a
cloudy
orange
that
carries
a
brown
touch
nose
is
slight
antiseptic
flavor
carries
the
same
a
bit
wilder
than
i
would
have
expected
really
slight
citrus
is
there
oranges
but
the
antiseptic
really
keeps
a
constant
presence
i
have
to
say
that
its
really
dry
too
feel
has
a
well
bodies
liquid
and
the
carbonation
is
slightly
lower
its
interesting
that
this
is
a
biere
de
garde
it
strikes
me
as
fairly
wild
overall
this
is
something
worth
trying
but
you
really
need
to
be
open
to
the
slight
funk
that
lambics
and
wild
ales
bring
to
be
able
to
fully
appreciate
this
one
d
very
good
this
is
decently
drinkable
beer
though
not
my
favorite
it
is
nice
to
see
the

actually

the

a

in

end
i
was
happy
to
share
this
one
still
it
is
one
beer
and
one
brewery
i
would
seek
out
again
the
taste
was
a
complex
malty
blend
of
sugar
toffee
with
some
raisin
and
apricot
and
some
peppery
spice
along
with
the
faint
sourness
associated
with
belgians
the
flavor
was
longlasting
and
finished
with
the
pepper
and
extended
with
some
satisfying
hoppiness

thiriez

isnt
a
biere

that
i
can
recommend
i
find
it
interesting
that
the
most
delicious
and
most
accomplished
version
that
ive
ever
hadof
what
is
one
of
the
most
belgian
and
french
of
all
styles
of
beerwas
brewed
in
michigan
usa
for
the
time
being
at
least
jolly
pumpkins
excellent
oro
de
calabaza
is
the
style
leader
in
my
eyes
the
beer
poured
a
hazy
copper
color
with
a
bubbly
tan
head
nice
nose
less
spice
forward
than
many
beers
of
this
style
its
more
about
the
yeast
just
a
ton
of
yeasty
bread
dough
followed
by
light
spice
a
little
cardamen
some
white
pepper
there
is
some
dark
fruit
dates
and
a
little
pomegranate
on
the
finish
flavor
has
more
of
the
yeasty
quality
i
really
find
that
refreshing
more
spice
than
i
get
on
the
nose
i
think
this
beer
may
have
a
little
pepper
in
it
the
heat
on
the
finish
feels
more
like
pepper
than
alcohol
but
i
could
be
fooled
loads
of
sweet
malt
come
through
midway
more
of
the
pomegranate
dark
caramel
a
little
bit
of
pear
nice
light
mouth
feel
good
drinkability
the
only
thing
i
dont
like
about
this
beer
was
the
shower
i
got
when
it
opened
it
was
a
little
too
carbonated
overall
i
had
the
distinct
pleasure
to
visit
brasserie
thiriez
way
back
in
april
2003
during
my
annual
easter
belgium
trip
with
wakefield
camra
at
that
time
i
wasnt
too
taken
with
the
range
of
beers
to
be
perfectly
frank
and
the
amber
was
my
least
favorite
of
all
of
them
when
i
sampled
it
at
the
brew
at
the
brewery
even
now
with
some
improvements
it
still
not
one
of
my
favorites
needs
to
do
more
to
earn
its
farmhouse
moniker
right
now
if
youve
ever
seen
the
thririez
brewery
youll
know
what
i
mean
when
i
say
that
it
is
too
stainless
and
clinical
and
still
aaa
an
average
amber
at
best
an
amber
alert
thank
you
to
bighuge
for
sending
this
one
west
much
appreciated
so
this
beer
is
an
orangeish
amber
color
dirty
white
head
and
lots
of
it
more
than
half
my
glass
to
begin
with
aroma
is
lemony
pepper
and
yeasty
some
hay
as
well
herbal
hop
traits
too
taste
is
candy
like
in
swetness
but
earthy
in
the
hop
department
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
spritzy
and
very
gaseous
not
impressed
this
beer
is
light
and
refreshing
yet
still
manages
to
have
a
nice
heft
to
it
that
makes
it
a
bit
satiating
as
well
refreshing
yet
satiating
i
really
how
the
beer
strikes
a
balance
between
these
two
disparate
descriptors
as
the
beer
loses
a
bit
of
its
spritzy
carbonation
it
begins
to
become
a
touch
more
satiating
but
it
is
still
not
heavy
or
chewy
the
malt
character
is
quite
nice
here
as
well
i
really
like
how
the
best
farmhouse
saisons
can
have
such
a
pronounced
malt
character
despite
all
of
the
other
exotic
yeast
characters
and
flavors

with

there
is
nothing

about
it

there
was
still
a
very
silky

on
the
glittering

body
smell
is
nice
and
intriguing
some
dark
malts
combined
with
a
sweet
and
citric
fruity
aspect
slightly
mouth
puckering
quite
weird
for
an
amber
beer
i
wouldnt
imbibe
my
floor
with
that
again
tjd250
o
this
bottle
is
approximately
a
2011
o
super
malted
and
nice
sweet
palate
i
would
like
to
age
this
and
see
where
it
goes
i
would
have
liked
to
have
more
funk
and
musty
notes
but
overall
it
a
well
done
beer
jd
the
mouthfeel
was
maybe
a
bit
undercarbonated
for
the
style
there
was
a
light
scrubbing
zestiness
and
amedium
bodied
heft
o
i
am
not
sure
how
old
this
one
is
but
either
way
it
was
not
too
bad
but
it
isnt
something
i
would
go
seeking
out
m
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
too
quick
to
fly
away
the
assertive
malts
and
lighter
fruit
flavors
are
a
nice
reminder
of
the
bdg
style
d
i
love
the
balance
and
how
consistent
this
one
improves
so
drinkable
and
with
the
7
00
abv
i
dont
have
to
worry
about
not
being
able
to
have
a
few
more
bombers
o
the
beer
smells
great
but
the
sweet
apple
cider
in
the
flavors
make
it
a
bit
tough
to
drink
though
it
does
get
better
as
it
warms
this
is
my
first
biere
de
garde
i
picked
it
up
while
in
florida
last
week
definitely
didnt
expect
to
find
krebs
there
it
poured
a
dirty
mop
water
like
copper
in
color
with
a
one
finger
off
white
head
that
laced
the
glass
the
aromas
are
interesting
the
first
thing
i
think
of
is
oatmeal
it
smells
like
dry
oatmeal
just
after
you
open
the
package
it
also
gives
off
honey
yeast
pale
malt
and
some
dortmunder
like
qualities
it
tastes
pretty
good
it
features
a
good
amount
of
yeast
and
honey
pale
malt
sweetness
it
kind
of
has
a
sweet
saison
thing
going
on
i
keep
thinking
of
oatmeal
with
honey
its
pretty
tasty
it
drinks
medium
in
body
and
is
pretty
drinkable
the
alcohol
isnt
present
at
all
and
the
aftertaste
is
appealing
as
well
i
found
this
to
be
a
pretty
good
beer
pours
a
very
light
copper
color
it
initially
has
a
white
head
but
cant
hold
it
at
all
there
is
very
very
little
lacing
even
a
goo
heavy
swirl
wont
bring
the
head
back
the
nose
has
some
subtle
light
malt
and
a
bit
of
faint
earthiness
there
is
a
small
quantity
of
dry
caramel
in
there
as
well
the
taste
has
some
light
earth
and
slight
hop
dryness
along
with
some
bread
pretty
basic
but
okay
light
body
with
moderate
carbonation
drinks
fairly
well
this
was
enjoyable
though
not
terribly
memorable
drinkability
this
was
an
interesting
beer
though
its
such
a
yeasty
beer
it
makes
it
hard
to
drink
i
mean
i
dont
mind
yeast
i
always
finish
the
bottle
yeast
included
but
this
was
perhaps
a
bit
too
much
thanks
blueokie
overall
this
one
reminded
me
a
lot
of
a
saison
but
had
some
other
flavors
going
on
decent
i
think
this
is
better
than
the
bells
jazz
series
and
they
were
all
bdg
bottle
pours
a
hazy

overall
pretty

especially
for
the
price
the
fruit
gets
a
little
too
big
even
for
the
style

well
with

overall
a
good
experience
this
beer
is
strange
the
longer
it
sets
the
worse
it
gets
even
with
different
temperatures
its
great
right
off
the
pour
weird
d
i
was
not
expecting
much
from
this
beer
but
it
was
quite
enjoyable
light
and
easy
to
drink
with
good
fruit
character
poured
a
22oz
bottle
into
my
dogfish
head
snifter
this
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
toffee
amber
with
a
decent
2
inch
white
head
that
leaves
just
a
slight
bit
of
lacing
down
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
aroma
starts
off
as
slightly
grainy
warms
up
with
over
ripe
apples
pears
and
almost
a
vinous
character
mild
caramel
and
toffee
notes
the
flavor
is
very
similar
over
ripe
apples
yeasty
biscuits
a
bit
of
toast
and
toffee
there
is
a
slight
bakers
chocolate
bitterness
at
the
very
tail
of
the
flavor
profile
the
one
thing
that
slightly
bothers
me
is
a
mild
tartness
that
lingers
in
the
middleend
of
the
profile
why
i
do
enjoy
it
and
think
it
adds
a
whole
level
to
it
i
dont
know
if
its
supposed
to
be
there
the
mouthfeel
is
very
dry
finishes
leaving
the
palate
craving
another
sip
over
all
this

im
glad
to

a

in

trying
their
had
at

enough
taste

some
nice
maltiness
to
it
a

caramely
and
toasty
belgian
yeast
strain
is
prevalent
but
still
seems
a
bit
cidery
and
sour
assuming
there
was
no
lacto
added
on
purpose
that
said
it
is
still
strangely
enjoyable
and
drinkable
even
with
the
offflavors
i
easily
finished
the
bomber
not
bad
and
i
would
like
to
try
it
on
tap
to
see
if
it
was
meant
to
taste
like
this
i
dont
come
across
many
good
biere
de

much
less
american
versions
of
the
style
this
is
a
gem
from
ok
that
i
would
love
to
drink
again
a
soft
but
noticeable
maltiness
fruity
yeast
esters
and
a
touch
of
earthiness
make
for
a
good

this
one
is
a
joy
to
drink
this
afternoon
thanks
lane
i
had
heard
great
things
about
this
and
was
pretty
let
down
not
very
flavorful
or
complex
thanks
to
thehand
unknown
abv
it
certainly
is
above
6
and
could
be
in
the
high
7
plus
large
offwhite
foamy
head
on
medium
yellow
body
some
lace
malty
and
lightly
spicey
aroma
pleasant
very
easy
mouthfeel
and
drinkable
i
have
had
better
of
the
style
yet
still
a
better
than
average
beer
d
this
is
a
pretty
good
american
version
of
the
style
peteschoc
makes
some
very
fine
brews
this
beer
was
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
i
was
expecting
a
much
richer
smoother
and
more
complex
flavor
profile
from
this
brew
drinkability
is
fairly
high
great
flavor
makes
this
brew
an
enjoyable
experience
smooth
drinking
the
best
thing
ever
to
come
out
of
the
entire
state
of
oklahoma
been
saving
this
one
for
about
6
months
or
so
poured
from
22oz
bottle
into
mcchouffe
tulip
a
rich
medium
goldenorange
amber
color
with
3
of
dense
frothy
head
lots
of
fine
bubbles
continue
to
rise
head
sticks
around
for
a
while
leaving
a
little
thin
lacing
aroma
is
fruity
a
touch
funky
with
apricots
and
bananas
in
the
mix
tastes
a
little
spicy
fruity
lots
of
nice
complexity
more
than
i
can
identify
long
lingering
finish
with
a
little
bitterness
and
touch
of
alcohol
heat
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
feels
mediumlight
bodied
smooth
very
refreshing
medium
carbonation
overall
a
great
beer
easy
to
drink
went
well
with
the
pasta
and
salad
i
made
probably
my
favorite
of
the
choc
lineup
drinks
great
for
the
style
a
very
good
stab
at
the
style
nice
refreshing
im
guessing
this
one
checks
in
slightly
under
5
8
abv
very
good
drinking
to
be
done
with
this
bottle
light
enough
to
enjoy
many
and
often
the
alcohol
can
creep
up
on
you
though
so
watch
yourself
drinkability
is
above
reproach
a
quintessential
session
beer
the
abv
is
mediumhigh
and
hidden
so
watch
out
cause
you
will
want
to
have
a
few
bottles
of
this
excellent
brew
good
beer
that
i
recommend
d
its
drinkable
but
not
a
good
representation
of
style
almost
takes
like
a
belgian
blond
cant
say
that
ive
had
a
lot
of
beer
from
oklahoma
but
perhaps
ive
been
overlooking
the
state
this
is
not
bad
not
bad
at
all
ill
be
picking
this
up
again
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
decent
kick
good
representation
of
style
even
though
it
may
not
be
one
of
my
favorites
this
is
a
good
complex
beer
to
relax
with
drinkability
not
bad
its
a
treat
to
finally
try
something
from
the
great
state
of
oklahoma
this
is
a
pleasant
and
well
rounded
brew
sweet
and
fruity
with
a
mild
character
certainly
worth
a
try
overall
pretty
good
if
it
were
available
in
my
area
i
would
pick
it
up
from
time
to
time
a
fantastic
addition
to
the
choc
lineup
i
wish
i
could
try
more
examples
of
the
style
pours
a
spectacularly
clear
light
amber
topped
with
a
34
inch
fluffy
white
head
that
settles
to
a
ring
in
a
minute
or
so
the
nose
is
all
malts
nice
light
sweetness
to
it
maybe
some
sour
green
apples
too
mouthfeel
is
very
silky
well
balanced
malt
forward
with
an
ever
so
slight
tease
of
what
i
presume
to
be
hops
at
the
tail
end
maybe
it
is
the
power
of
suggestion
but
i
do
pickup
a
some
of
the
muskiness
that
is
expected
with
this
stlye
beer
i
consider
myself
a
hop
head
yet
i
am
drawn
to
this
beer
this
is
a
pretty
good
rating
for
my
first
beer
of
a
style
but
i
will
be
looking
for
more
of
these
in
the
future
hopefully
the
compare
i
have
put
back
several
to
see
how
they
cellar
no
bias
here
this
is
a
very
good
beer
and
the
krebs
bunch
should
be
very
proud
of
this
one
im
in
the
mood
for
a
little
roadtrip
and
a
bit
of
italian
food
to
pair
this
one
with
now
pours
a
golden
orange
with
a
small
offwhite
head
slightly
cloudy
due
to
the
bottle
conditioning
and
perhaps
some
proteins
seems
to
have
the
signature
hefeweizen
aroma
taste
is
malty
and
sweet
with
a
bit
of
bananas
and
cloves
as
well
as
a
slight
lemony
flavor
perhaps
they
have
a
little
wheat
malt
in
here
the
hop
bitterness
is
there
and
rounds
things
out
but
is
somewhat
faint
rich
mouthfeel
full
bodied
good
carbonation
this
is
a
very
good
beer
it
would
be
very
easy
to
drink
the
entire
22oz
bottle
by
myself
not
too
overpowering
would
make
a
good
session
beer
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
i
suspect
ill
appreciate
this
beer
even
more
on
the
second
try
and
will
pick
up
a
lot
more
complexity
than
this
first
try
it
truly
is
a
worldclass
beer
way
to
go
krebs
brewing
you
do
oklahoma
proud
o
my
first
in
this
style
i
am
really
liking
this
beer
got
it
in
st
louis
drinking
it
in
rolla
mo
aug
5th
2014
visually
impressive
with
the
initial
overflow
of
carbonation
the
first
american
beer
ive
had
that
has
captured
that
sometimes
found
belgian
aspect
bottle
poured
a
clear
deep
orangey
color
ale
with
a
small
foamy
head
with
minimal
retention
and
no
lacing
aroma
of
grainy
cereal
notes
with
quite
a
bit
of
residuals
sugars
taste
is
also
a
mess
with
an
overload
of
residual
sugars
and
some
grainy
cereal
notes
with
some
funny
ester
body
is
semifull
with
mediumtolow
carbonation
incredible
mess
with
a
definite
lack
of
attenuation
prost
this
is
a
decent
biere
de
garde
frankly
it
seems
more
like
a
belgian
ale
that
has
a
tart
aspect
to
it
thankfully
that
seemed
to
calm
down
over
time
but
its
still
there
more
than
i
would
like
thicker
feel
and
flavor
on
this
one
a
good
stab
at
the
style
but
i
think
i
have
had
better
though
most
of
those
would
be
from
across
the
pond
low
a
o
this
beer
doesnt
have
as
much
earthiness
compared
to
other
beers
in
the
style
but
is
a
really
nice
beer
if
you
like
smelling
and
tasting
yeast
no
traces
of
alcohol
are
present
in
the
taste
pretty
decent
beer
here
seems
to
me
to
be
closer
to
a
belgian
pale
ale
as
the
flavor
profile
puts
me
in
mind
of
the
belgian
style
not
quite
a
blow
me
away
beer
but
a
pretty
decent
one
im
glad
i
picked
up
while
at
the
brewpub
medium
bodied
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
with
soft
carbonation
a
nice
beer
which
i
will
buy
again
if
i
get
the
chance
o
good
beer
that
i
would
purchase
if
it
ran
into
it
again
but
probably
wouldnt
seek
out
well
done
rep
of
the
style
from
what
in
know
about
the
style
which
admittedly
isnt
much
i
liked
it
nice
fallwinter
beer
with
the
kind
of
applecinnamon
thing
it
had
going
on
three
finger
head
with
some
retention
on
a
hazy
amber
orange
body
little
lacing
aroma
of
orange
peel
pungent
belgian
yeast
and
light
herbal
hops
flavor
is
just
a
little
watery
especially
in
the
finish
up
front
pear
and
orange
for
citrus
belgian
yeast
understated
sweetness
and
breads
medium
body
and
moderate
to
high
carbonation
semi
dry
finish
this
is
a
very
nice
representation
of
the
style
it
has
all
the
right
belgin
character
with
the
right
body
overall
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
subtle
malt
dominated
earthy
with
slight
funk
overall
quite
good
one
gets
the
impression
that
the
brewers
of
this
ale
never
actually
sampled
a
french
farmhousestyle
ale
though
there
is
some
similarity
to
a
malt
rather
than
yeast
driven
ale
brewed
by
fantome
on
an
off
day
flavor
and
aroma
are
mostly
pleasant
none
the
less
pours
perfumed
mildly
spicy
with
a
soapy
headed
medium
golden
body
very
smooth
drinker
that
went
well
with
a
multicourse
dinner
the
citrus
and
pleasantly
spicy
taste
was
excellent
on
a
hot
night
soft
mouthfeel
solid
biere
de
garde
picked
up
in
madison
about
9
months
back
love
this
style
and
love
this
take
on
it
added
element
to
this
that
make
you
think
of
fruit
and
malt
and
wooden
casks
worth
drinking
one
of
these
bombers
right
to
the
last
drop
o
a
fun
beer
that
makes
me
sit
up
and
pay
attention
this
has
a
lot
of
complexity
and
makes
me
smile
to
drink
like
any
complex
beer
its
difficult
to
put
this
into
words
il
revisit
this
one
and
seriously
consider
trying
to
brew
the
style
in
an
attempt
to
get
similar
results
i
would
love
to
get
a
few
bottles
of
this
and
cellar
them
for
a
year
or
two
taste
is
rich
and
even
has
malty
pretty
strong
spice
and
orange
and
also
rather
sweet
heavy
body
but
not
lots
of
carbonation
this
has
some
categories
that
match
a
farmhouse
ale
but
is
somewhat
like
a
tripel
as
well
pretty
good
but
i
have
had
better
o
not
bad
i
find
the
sweet
and
slightly
sour
taste
to
be
quite
palatable
as
stated
earlier
it
somewhat
resembles
apple
juice
and
cmon
who
doesnt
like
apple
juice
happy
mardi
gras
pretty
good
beer
definitely
done
well
for
the
style
o
very
nice
for
the
style
i
can
see
having
this
from
time
to
time
i
would
like
to
try
this
after
it
has
aged
for
a
while
overall
im
having
a
good
time
with
it
consider
it
recommended
bottle
shared
at
the
december
iteration
of
the
santa
cruz
tasting
series
pours
dark
bronze
with
a
small
white
head
aromas
of
bruised
apples
and
old
caramelstale
bread
unfiltered
apple
juice
in
the
flavor
bready
and
honeyed
tart
fruitiness
medium
bitterness
tastes
old
fruity
nose
with
a
malty
backbone
but
not
too
much
fruit
on
the
tonge
would
like
more
tartness
and
drying
in
this
one
to
be
honest
an
okay
attempt
at
a
biere
de
garde
4
5
d
tasty
beer
throughout
all
flavors
complement
each
other
extremely
well
solid
overall
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
offerings
from
schlafly
i
talked
to
one
of
the
brewers
while
at
the
tap
house
and
he
says
that
the
biere
de
garde
settles
and
ages
a
bit
quite
nicely
in
fact
he
recommended
it
id
say
this
is
one
of
schlaflys
top
34
offerings
a
totally
responsible
representation
of
the
style
the
beer
is
one
of
those
beers
that
when
you
want
some
real
suds
you
ask
for
this
one
this
is
one
you
crave
this
is
one
for
the
cult
followings
i
could
drink
this
one
every
day
ill
have
another
please
the
aroma
was
light
hints
of
grian
light
hops
and
a
touch
of
light
peach
and
pear
fruit
notes
subtle
would
be
the
ideal
word
here
there
was
a
very
nice
flavor
here
nothing
really
huge
just
very
light
and
drinkable
nice
touches
of
light
grains
and
small
doses
of
light
fruit
mixing
well
and
with
subtle
yet
adequate
carbonation
the
whole
thing
seemed
to
come
together
quite
well
notes
an
almostlovely
beer
the
nose
and
the
flavors
are
beautiful
its
just
the
mouthfeel
is
sharp
and
prickly
so
close
to
being
great
wish
i
knew
how
old
this
was
to
say
weather
it
needed
more
time
or
less
medium
mouthfeel
that
finishes
fairly
dry
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
to
be
a
regular
in
the
rotation
but
would
be
an
excellent
dessert
beer
or
after
dinner
drink
overall
this
was
a
solid
beer
but
was
a
bit
on
the
fruity
side
for
my
liking
for
the
style
still
its
worth
a
shot
overall
very
enjoyable
brew
md
perhaps
the
actual
surprise
here
is
the
feel
it
is
thin
and
carbonated
just
fine
but
man
is
it
dry
it
highlights
the
strong
and
tart
tendencies
of
the
taste
and
actually
makes
the
beer
seem
a
whole
lot
better
than
it
probably
is
it
isnt
the
most
inviting
but
the
smack
in
the
face
when
you
do
try
it
makes
it
a
worthwhile
experience
very
interesting
ale
i
was
expecting
more
of
a
dry
refreshing
saisontype
beer
this
was
actually
quite
rich
and
malty
i
havent
had
many
biere
de
gardes
bieres
de
garde
so
perhaps
this
is
par
for
the
course
whatever
the
case
this
is
a
very
good
beer
and
i
certainly
recommend
it
o
super
impressed
by
this
beer
i
dont
have
a
lot
of
experience
w
this
style
but
that
doesnt
matter
this
is
a
fantastic
brew
if
you
get
schlafly
where
you
live
go
pick
this
one
up
its
really
worth
it
o
quite
nice
i
was
very
impressed
with
this
beer
and
look
forward
to
have
another
in
this
style
had
there
not
been
other
beers
i
wanted
to
try
the
night
i
had
this
i
would
have
gotten
another
one
i
havent
had
many
of
them
but
this
strikes
me
as
a
very
good
example
of
the
stylelike
a
malty
earthy
saison
not
one
of
my
favorite
styles
though
ill
admit
750ml
is
more
than
enough
compared
to
3
monts
this
is
a
step
down
but
a
decent
interpretation
altogether
begs
to
be
paired
with
cheese
or
cured
meats
as
the
bottle
says
paired
nicely
with
les
frères
a
farmhouse
cheese
from
crave
bros
in
waterloo
wi
the
sweettartearthythick
combo
was
a
bit
offputting
at
first
but
later
seemed
to
settle
down
the
2nd
glass
was
easier
to
drink
drinkability
i
enjoyed
every
part
of
this
beer
and
will
be
promoting
it
to
other
curious
drinkers
from
the
itap
house
now
this
is
my
favorite
beer
from
schlafly
could
enjoy
34
more
but
had
to
leave
the
bar
because
of
our
blizzard
scare
throughout
st
louis
news
and
television
station
interruptions
drinkability
a
super
malty
and
earth
beer
that
gets
better
as
it
warms
very
good
but
not
my
favorite
in
the
style
a
sipper
that
i
may
pick
up
again
cheers
nothing
extraordinary
here
but
i
thought
this
a
solid
enjoyable
beer

into
my
tank
7
glass
full
and
frothy
white
head
color
is
a
deep
copper
darker
than
i
was
expecting
aroma
isnt
as
strong
as
i
would
have
hoped
though
it
is
certainly
there
notes
of
barnyard
are
the
first
thing
i
notice
theres
some
residual
sweetness
just
under
the
surface
as
well
i
get
some
light
cereal
notes
followed
by
cherry
and
white
grape
this
is
highly
carbonated
the
mouthfeel
is
very
bubbly
and
effervescent
and
bubbles
go
on
for
days
in
my
glass
the
taste
starts
off
tart
almost
mouth
puckering
so
and
then
leans
towards
the
sour
end
of
the
spectrum
again
i
think
of
really
tart
cherries
chased
by
pear
juice
the
fruit
flavors
give
way
to
a
brief
bit
of
grainy
maltiness
some
alcohol
is
definitely
present
in
the
beer
as
it
is
most
likely
accented
by
the
esters
given
off
by
the
yeast
during
fermentation
and
as
the
beer
warms
these
alcohol
notes
are
accented
which
can
be
good
or
bad
depending
on
your
point
of
view
this
has
somewhat
of
a
chewable
vitamin
finish
the
biere
de
garde
style
is
a
cousin
to
the
saison
one
of
my
favorite
styles
of
beer
ive
had
some
very
good
saisons
and
while
this
one
isnt
quite
top
notch
its
not
bad
and
the
flavor
profile
is
certainly
in
my
wheel
house
medium
and
full
mouthfeel
not
overly
carbonated
it
is
very
drinkable
and
hides
the
abv
well
a
pleasure
to
drink
drinkability
not
a
quick
drinking
beer
but
there
is
some
overall
refreshment
with
this
worthy
of
giving
this
one
a
try
drinks
pretty
good
but
not
outstanding
for
the
style
not
amongst
the
top
of
the

earthy

flavor
profile
the
taste
makes
me
think
of
a
spring
meadow
near
an
orchard
large
bottle
from
deciccos
in
ardsley
ny
i

inch

and

all
the
way
up
to
where
the
top
of
the
head
was
musty
fruity
and
malted
up

complex
and
inviting
bdg
some

some
mustiness

notes
floating
across

need
to
be
mentioned
ripe
pears
and
light
raisins
with
earthiness
abounding
yeasty
final
pour
adds
the
expected
cloudy
light
brown
look
and
a
hint
of
nuts
really
enjoyed
this
one
i
like
this
beer
and
would
buy
it
again
kudos
schlafly
drinkability
is
excellent
i
drank
the
whole
bottle
with
steak
and
fried
rice
and
it
held
up
very
well
i
could
drink
this
till
i
pass
out
very
nice
out
of
a
750ml
capped
bottle
pours
a
hazy
honey
brown
color
with
a
nice
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
settles
into
a
very
puffy
cap
the
aroma
has
a
tart
lemony
twang
along
with
some
belgian
or
hefe
yeast
phenol
characteristics
the
taste
takes
a
180
from
the
aroma
the
taste
is
of
caramel
malt
with
a
rye
like
spiciness
and
brown
sugar
all
resulting
in
an
earthy
flavor
there
is
also
some
metal
and
lemony
flavors
along
with
some
subtle
yeast
phenols
the
flavor
is
pretty
spot
on
for
the
style
the
beer
has
a
moderate
body
with
airy
carbonation
an
almost
creamy
texture
sweet
throughout
with
some
sourtart
notes
popping
through
a
good
biere
de
garde
it
showcases
the
malt
has
a
nice
earty
spice
quality
and
drinks
easy
this
is
a
real
quality
style
when
made
well
beer
is
medium
in
body
and
finishes
nicely
good
spice
in
the
middle
and
overall
pretty
good
not
sure
how
good
a
bière
de
garde
this
is
but
its
a
good
beer
overall
notes
pity
this
could
be
an
off
bottle
andor
a
lesser
offering
from
schlafly
i
typically
like
their
brews
quite
a
bit
with
some
among
my
favorites
but
this
one
is
far
from
the
cut
supporting
the
idea
of
a
bad
bottle
or
a
badly
crafted
brew
i
had
an
intense
last
pour
unapologetically
i
poured
the
end
including
all
yeast
and
sediment
very
hazy
final
serving
with
ugly
to
average
presentation
but
at
least
the
flavor
picked
up
a
richness
close
to
what
this
should
be
like
timidly
fruity
very
sweet
spicy
with
cinnamon
and
sugar
dominating
at
least
it
had
some
aroma
with
character
still
no
tartness
sour
or
complex
earthy
notes
at
any
point
nice
screenprinted
mag
bottle
bottle
conditioned
and
the
pour
was
appropriately
slightly
turbid
aggressive
tight
head
required
a
careful
pour
some
yeast
flavors
with
predominant
caramel
malt
body
slightly
vinious
finish
not
sure
if
this
is
the
best
example
of
the
particular
style
but
a
welldone
beer
in
the
general
belgian
realm
like
those
of
unibroue
chewy
and
malty
in
the
mouth
with
sweet
toffee
dominating
the
flavor
tastes
like
a
bock
with
a
belgian
twist
too
sweet
to
be
very
drinkable
for
me
overall
pretty
good
not
really
engaging
at
any
point
this
beer
tastes
of
the
earth
it
is
very
clear
and
a
light
brown
color
the
head
was
fair
and
lingered
for
a
while
the
taste
is
a
little
too
sour
for
me
it
could
use
a
bit
more
malt
sweetness
it
makes
me
think
of
a
flemish
sour
or
something
of
a
similar
style
rather
than
a
bier
de
garde
overall
its
a
good
beer
but
not
my
favorite
of
this
style
d
this
is
a
decent
attempt
at
the
style
but
its
a
bit
rough
around
the
edges
its
done
to
style
but
not
really
outstanding
d
this
is
a
very
nice
drinkable
beer
i
enjoyed
the
sourness
and
funk
in
this
nothing
too
over
the
top
but
this
beer
is
great
for
what
it
is
overall
i
liked
it
and
would
love
to
revisit
this
one
when
the
temp
is
closer
to
100
than
0
poured
a
gentle
amber
color
with
some
light
cloudiness
great
head
with
differing
size
bubbles
and
good
lacing
aroma
is
light
with
some
belgian
hints
but
primarily
of
apples
tastes
good
very
tart
and
slightly
sour
with
apples
being
the
primary
flavor
mouthfeel
is
a
crisp
medium
body
very
slightly
oily
drinkability
is
good
for
the
style
though
a
little
tart
for
my
tastes
mouthfeel
was
medium
in
body
with
tiny
carbonation
bubbles
there
was
a
smoothness
to
this
one
i
wont
seek
it
out
again
but
it
was
worthwhile
drinkability
it
has
a
good
warming
feeling
without
being
too
warm
d
this
is
incredible
reading
the
back
of
the
bottle
schlafly
suggests
this
ages
well
the
bottle
i
tried
was
about
a
year
old
from
cellaring
i
now
wish
i
had
more
of
these
cellaring
taste
is
tart
fruitiness
with
hints
of
sourness
and
even
a
touch
of
vinegar
and
barrel
staves
malts
are
toasted
caramel
and
even
could
be
described
as
earthy
hops
are
there
for
a
bit
of
balance
but
pretty
much
just
along
for
the
ride
this
is
quite
tasty
surprisingly
sour
in
a
good
way
and
slightly
funky
carbonation
is
creamy
and
smooth
and
adds
another
layer
of
complexity
to
the
drinking
experience
different
from
most
farmhouse
ales
as
it
has
a
darker
heavier
malt
presence
i
will
look
for
this
one
again
for
sure
i
have
been
pleased
with
most
of
the
offerings
i
have
had
from
schlafly
so
far
good
drinkability
crispy
mouthfeel
but
with
good
body
pours
a
very
hazy
burnt
orange
color
i
mean
i
really
cant
see
through
it
but
i
can
see
bits
of
yellow
around
the
edges
in
the
light
the
head
that
form
is
great
nice
and
white
rises
up
about
an
inch
then
falls
back
to
a
nice
ring
leaving
bits
of
lacing
around
it
looks
about
right
the
smell
has
quite
a
bit
of
tartness
like
raw
underripe
berry
fruitiness
smells
a
bit
yeasty
maybe
a
little
strong
with
some
fruity
alcohol
quite
a
bit
of
that
fruity
fermentation
smell
thrown
out
there
im
not
sure
how
much
i
really
like
it
but
then
again
there
isnt
just
one
way
a
biere
de
garde
should
smell
the
taste
keeps
it
up
with
the
fruity
frementation
flavor
the
raw
yeasty
taste
it
kind
of
hides
the
rest
of
the
beer
as
well
as
the
peachy
alcohol
flavor
as
far
as
everything
else
theres
a
distinct
graininess
way
more
than
barley
but
it
just
tastes
like
raw
crushed
grain
maybe
some
oatmeal
andor
other
cooked
grains
i
think
it
has
the
kind
of
stuff
that
you
expect
but
i
think
im
wishing
that
it
was
just
lighter
allaround
it
hides
some
of
the
things
i
was
looking
for
as
far
as
the
mouthfeel
goes
the
beer
is
a
little
too
heavy
and
the
carbonation
is
a
little
too
sharp
overall
this
kind
of
reminds
me
of
a
first
attempt
at
something
that
a
homebrewer
tried
ive
tasted
something
surprisingly
similar
made
by
a
friend
a
few
of
my
beers
have
had
this
taste
i
think
it
needs
work
maybe
it
should
be
lightened
up
aged
a
little
more
so
that
the
flavors
that
the
yeast
should
impart
can
come
to
the
front
the
abv
on
this
seems
a
little
higher
and
harder
than
i
want
too
so
its
harder
to
drink
than
id
want
as
well
id
be
interested
to
try
this
again
with
some
improvements
i
want
to
see
what
kind
of
yeast
character
this
has
pours
a
cloudy
orangeamber
color
one
inch
head
of
a
white
color
great
retention
and
great
lacing
smells
of
sweet
malt
citrus
yeast
hops
and
slight
alcohol
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
slightly
thick
with
a
low
carbonation
level
tastes
of
sweet
malt
citrus
banana
tart
malt
yeast
hops
and
alcohol
overall
a
great
body
blend
complexity
and
aroma
not
quite
as
good
as
the
cask
version
but
still
a
very
good
beer
especially
for
only
around
seven
dollars
im
not
huge
on
schlafly
as
far
as
their
everyday
offerings
go
but
i
am
loving
their
seasonal
and
oneoff
releases
way
to
step
it
up
schlafly
very
good
brew
only
my
second
biere
de
garde
after
weyebacher
foxtrot
ive
enjoyed
both
might
seek
out
others
if
i
get
the
chance
there
arent
a
lot
of
biere
de
gardes
out
there
and
its
hard
to
find
good
ones
from
those
that
are
available
its
nice
to
see
theres
a
quality
biere
de
garde
brewed
as
close
as
st
louis
thanks
again
for
the
bottle
vance
d
i
can
sip
on
this
beer
all
day
every
day
i
drank
the
whole
750ml
bottle
and
still
wanted
more
a
great
farmy
style
that
i
will
actively
seek
out
now
taste
is
of
candied
sugar
up
front
along
with
some
spice
there
is
a
faint
funkiness
in
the
background
and
towards
the
finish
along
with
some
refreshing
tart
fruit
and
peaches
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
and
on
the
heavier
side
of
medium
bodied
a
wonderful
stab
at
the
style
from
schlafly
tried
a
bottle
purchased
in
august
2010
in
august
2012
note
that
despite
the
bottle
recommending
aging
it
this
one
is
much
better
fresh
than
old
i
got
this
750
ml
bottle
via
a
trade
with
erik
in
indiana
it
poured
a
hazy
orange
to
brown
with
very
little
head
nose
of
oranges
clove
and
some
grassy
hops
medium
mouthfeel
flavor
is
fairly
complex
with
ripe
fruits
dominating
lightly
bitter
finish
most
enjoyable
very
tasty
brew
light
on
the
alcohol
as
this
brew
weighs
in
with
7
and
no
appearance
of
it
in
the
sampling
another
schlafly
goodie
tastes
like
sweet
pumpkin
pie
filling
mixed
with
green
apples
sour
apricots
and
yeasty
oj
fizzy
ebulliant
mouthfeel
like
my
tongue
was
going
to
go
numb
but
didnt
d
this
is
an
extremely
enjoyable
beer
thank
you
matt
for
setting
me
up
with
this
great
beer
drink
pretty
easy
for
the
style
abv
a
very
good
stab
at
the
style
that
i
will
try
again
in
cooler
weather
to
see
if
it
is
better
or
worse
this
got
a
bit
thick
boozey
as
the
bottle
drained
mouthfeeldrinkability
a
little
creamy
and
slick
this
is
a
very
good
beer
has
a
champagin
feel
to
it
it
is
my
first
of
the
style
though
and
now
i
will
be
looking
for
others
for
sure
pours

this
is
another
nice
one
from
schlafly
drinkability
well
thats
fairly
nice
a
real
honest
thirst
quencher
deep
down
were
all
striving
for
a
great
bière
de
garde
schlaflys
offering
comes
pretty
close
it
is
a
bottle
conditioned
french
farmhouse
ale
i
like
everything
about
this
beer
the
smell
the
appearance
the
taste
it
is
slightly
sweet
yet
still
earthy
i
always
stock
up
on
it
when
it
is
available
a
quick
checks
shows
i
have
eight
750
ml
bottles
on
hand
which
is
fine
since
this
one
gets
better
with
age
though
it
rarely
has
a
chance
to
so
i
love
the
citrus
taste
and
every
time
we
pair
it
with
food
not
matter
what
type
of
food
it
is
always
a
good
compliment

good
the
first
glass
poured
clear
the

was
cloudy

the

that
settled
on

it
smells
like

belgian
candy
sugar
slightly
tart
orange
peppery

a

taste
is

some

its
smooth
and
quite
refreshing
i
think
this
is
a
good
overall
brew
its
a
good
example
of
why
schlafly
is
becoming
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
overall
a
solid
but
not
spectacular
beer
easy
drinking
and
goes
down
smooth
but
just
not
enough
flavor
to
it
to
make
it
stand
out
do
recommend
for
me
one
and
done
unless
i
could
try
on
tap
refreshing
and
well
balanced
overall
impression
much
to
my
surprise
this
little
st
louis
brewery
made
a
pretty
good
farmhouse
style
beer
who
would
have
thought
i
drink
many
belgian
beers
but
im
not
as
familiar
with
bier
de
garde
and
farmhouse
style
to
my
taste
this
is
a
really
nice
beer
i
looked
up
the
bjcp
2008
style
guide
for
bier
de
garde
and
i
dont
find
anything
out
of
place
or
missing
its
a
solid
beer
i
could
easily
put
down
several
of
these
bottom
line
this
is
my
6th
encounter
with
biere
de
gardes
and
judging
from
my
reviews
i
guess
i
favour
the
style
actually
im
not
guessing
at
all
i
love
em
schlafly
biere
de
garde
is
the
real
deal
and
is
one
of
the
best
versions
in
recent
memory
that
didnt
hail
from
either
belgium
or
france
if
youre
sitting
on
an
orange
crowned
bottle
2007
its
drinking
mighty
fine
right
now
drinkability
ill
try
more
of
the
style
as
i
see
it
but
more
for
posterityseducation
sake
poured
into
a
rapscallion
glass
formed
a
1
offwhite
head
over
the
clear
bright
copper
brew
head
lasts
and
lasts
constantly
replenished
by
the
streams
of
tiny
bubbles
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
lacing
is
sporadic
but
chunky
when
present
aroma
is
clean
and
citrusy
with
a
light
earthiness
taste
begins
lightly
sweet
quickly
turns
to
the
lemony
citrus
which
carries
through
but
recedes
somewhat
at
the
close
to
let
the
sedate
mustiness
peek
through
mouthfeel
is
smallbubbled
and
smooth
and
drinkability
is
nice
crisp
thirstquencher
here
with
alcohol
warmth
that
sneaks
up
over

drinkability
is
moderate
great
flavors
and
moderate
alcohol
make
this
easy
to
consume
a
nice
brew
for
sure
a
very
good
beer
with
good
drinkability
schlafly
seems
to
pull
of
these
complex
belgian
styles
effortlessly
this
beer
pours
with
bright
rust
color
moderate
haze
and
fantastic
offwhite
head
formation
retention
and
lacing
an
overall
impressive
look
aromas
are
partmalt
part

with
an
emphasis
on
toasty
bready
notes
bruised
oranges
lemon
rinds
apples
and
appricots
round
out
the
estery
aromas
mild
plastic
and
peppery
phenols
also
add
to
the
complexity
woodsy
and
musty
late
flavors
of
malt
and
fruity
esters
continue
their
balance
a
light
toasty
flavor
is
accentuated
by
herbal
hops
and
light
acidic
flavors
remaining
spicy
and
citrusy
til
the
end
body
is
quite
full
for
the
style
but
lifted
off
the
palate
by
an
airy
carbonation
a
well
attenuated
character
helps
to
keep
the
beer
palatable
but
it
still
has
a
weight
that
seems
high
finishes
with
a
hit
of
appricots
lightly
grassycitrus
notes
and
a
musty
cellarlike
quality
taste
opens
dry
herbal
and
slightly
minty
not
a
lot
of
funkiness
caramel
sweetness
offers
a
solid
malt
backbone
nicely
balanced
very
nice
but
nothing
here
reaches
out
and
says
this
is
a
topnotch
biere
de
garde
perhaps
with
some
age
this
one
might
really
impress
still
quite
nicely
done
and
one
i
would
be
happy
to
revisit
soon
hard
pour
into
a
duvel
gives
a
somewhat
cloudy
orange
amber
hue
vey
nice
foamy
head
that
crests
the
glass
nice
looking
beer
and
i
can
tell
that
this
is
going
to
be
a
creamy
treat
it
is
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
very
lightly
carbonated
tastes
great
too
mild
yeasty
funk
not
quite
sour
never
really
goes
into
that
territory
smells
are
grassy
with
some
green
apples
quite
mild
though
very
drinkable
abv
is
on
the
nose
i
like
this
one
a
lot
another
homerun
for
this
brewery
along
with
their
great
saison
will
buy
again
for
sure
md
very
refreshing
light
about
right
carbonation
i
am
going
to
try
aging
one
really
cant
wait
for
the
results
the
fresh
one
on
tap
was
damned
decent
this
beer
pours
dark
amber
almost
orange
with
a
thick
full
head
that
dissipates
relatively
quickly
leaving
a
thin
layer
of
foam
on
top
of
the
beer
it
has
a
hint
of
citrus
on
the
nose
with
a
bit
of
yeasty
sweetness
it
has
a
sharp
bite
in
the
front
of
the
mouth
i
also
noticed
the
yeast
flavors
coming
out
as
well
it
has
a
bit
of
hop
bitterness
that
nicely
balances
the
sweetness
pprice
7
bucks
for
a
750
ml
a
little
steep
for
me
d
this
is
a
very
nice
biere
de
garde
i
was
quite
impressed
with
it
id
like
to
try
one
that
has
aged
a
little
more
mouthfeel
is
light
and
refreshing
the
carbonation
is
very
crisp
the
bottle
info
says
that
this
can
be
aged
well
ill
have
to
give
it
a
shot
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
medium
in
body
with
lower
levels
of
carbonation
this
brew
feels
pretty
good
in
the
mouth
its
pretty
smooth
alcohol
warms
the
mouth
once
the
beer
has
been
swallowed
this
is
a
beer
id
not
be
opposed
to
drinking
again
however
i
would
really
like
to
sample
some
others
before
i
come
back
to
it
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
from
schlafly
it
was
my
first
biere
de
garde
but
definitely
not
my
last
im
going
to
pick
up
a
few
more
of
these
and
trying
aging
one
for
a
while
if
i
can
resist
drinking
it
very
refreshing
just
dont
like
it
ok
this
bottle
was
past
its
best
by
date
and
kind
of
on
the
flat
side
i
will
try
again
color
is
interesting
with
very
little
head
the
smell
has
a
funk
or
a
spice
i
do
not
care
for
but
it
was
not
prevalent
in
the
beer
and
the
taste
really
grew
on
me
very
good
beer
good
light
feeling
but
still
with
a
full
mouth
feel
with
a
smooth
dry
finish
not
sure
what
this
style
is
supposed
to
be
like
but
this
beer
is
ok
3
95
the
nose
is
like
a
cheeseeating
surrender
monkey
the
flavor
is
like
charles
de
gaulle
amber
to
gold
in
color
with
nice
foam
and
some
lacing
mild
aroma
enjoyable
malty
taste
very
mild
but
suprisingly
complex
lingers
in
the
mouth
and
goes
down
easy
overall
a
very
enjoyable
brew
its
ok
nothing
special
normal
beer
a
light
amber
beer
with
incredible
amounts
of
flavors
all
well
balanced
i
was
surprised
at
the
myriad
of
flavors
from
spices
to
fruits
to
caramel
but
it
all
works
so
well
and
somehow
the
beer
goes
down
easy
and
is
very
light
it
is
a
sweet
beer
but
nothing
over
the
top
all
in
all
this
is
a
great
beer
for
sitting
around
a
porch
chatting
and
just
having
a
high
quality
crafted
beer
othis
is
pretty
solid
beer
i
dont
know
that
i
will
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
it
again
but
for
general
drinking
purposes
this
fits
the
bill
very
nicely
it
offers
good
complexity
and
i
can
see
it
pairing
well
with
food
served
in
a
chilled
pint
glass
nice
copper
color
not
much
head
this
farmhouse
ale
has
a
very
satisfying
taste
i
like
it
brown
in
color
with
good
clarity
a
fingernail
of
beige
foam
covers
the
majority
of
the
top
aroma
is
all
amber
malt
the
flavor
is
primarily
amber
malt
with
notes
of
caramel
the
mouth
is
lightly
salty
and
dry
what
a
nice
ale
dark
amber
color
smooth
clean
flavor
on
the
palate
mild
caramel
flavor
and
nice
lace
on
the
edge
of
the
glass
6
pack
for
a
gift
happy
accident
for
me
the
alcohol
was
perfect
here
and
thats
not
something
that
i
say
very
often
but
it
complemented
everything
else
so
wonderfully
while
not
a
pumpkin
beer
this
had
the
feel
one
one
in
certain
aspects
without
being
overly
spicy
or
heavy
tot
he
taste
if
there
was
a
bit
of
champagne
yeast
in
this
it
wouldnt
surprise
me
as
this
had
a
light
feel
to
it
from
start
to
finish
this
was
wonderful
stuff
that
put
a
smile
on
my
face
and
proved
to
me
that
more
u
s
brewers
should
give
this
style
a
go
and
while
not
as
potent
or
full
as
something
imported
here
two
brothers
had
a
winner
here
thats
sure
to
offend
no
one
give
it
a
go
before
the
fall
weather
gives
way
to
old
man
winter
o
a
rather
enjoyable
biere
de
garde
which
manages
to
provide
a
decent
array
of
hop
flavors
without
steamrollering
the
malt
a
drinkable
take
on
the
style
perhaps
a
bit
too
sweet
but
worth
a
go

my
first

offering
is
a
huge
winner
in
my
book
from
top
to
bottom
this
is
a
delicious
appetizing
beer
think
i
may
have
just
found
a
new
style
frenchstyle
country
ale
respectively
i
thoroughly
enjoy
o
some
big
flavor
but
easy
to
drink
im
not
hugely
into
this
mashup
of
hoppyamberfarmhouse
luckily
they
dont
take
either
of
those
elements
too
far
and
end
up
with
something
pretty
good
the
beer
is
slightly
hazy
with
a
deep
amber
body
and
a
reddish
cast
beneath
a
short
but
creamy
head
of
white
foam
the
nose
is
offers
a
combination
of
delicately
toasty
and
strawlike
grain
with
caramel
and
slight
fruitiness
the
body
is
mediumlight
with
a
zesty
veryfine
bubbled
carbonation
the
flavor
starts
with
bold
toasty
and
caramel
malts
upfront
followed
by
a
splash
of
fruit
sour
cherry
tangerine
plum
that
fades
into
a
rather
dry
finish
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
light
the
beer
reminds
me
of
a
toastier
and
drier
irish
ale
i
loved
it
o
nice
its
a
bit
more
roasty
than
i
was
expecting
o
refreshing

interesting
easy
drinking
and
complex

i
was
expecting
this
beer
to
be
a
bit
sweetersyrupy
judging
by
the
appearance
but
i
was
wrong
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
malty
light
and
full
of
flavor
overall
a
bit
too
unbalanced
for
me
first
drink
was
bad
but
it
got
a
bit
better
as
it
went
on
beerandwhiskeyhq
overall
great
beer
i
have
not
had
many
beers
of
this
style
so
it
is
difficult
to
compare
it
to
others
but
it
did
not
disappoint

a
very

although
it
is
very
smooth
and
lay

it

initially
suggests

trying

clever
i
like
this
beer
and
am
learning
to
appreciate
the
local
craftmicro
beer
companies
but
am
thinking
i
picked
the
wrong
1st
2bro
brew
its
a
fine
beer
to
be
certain
but
my
taste
buds
are
evolving
from
an
adjunct
mass
produced
brew
to
a
more
refined
beer
with
character
and
distinction
i
will
say
that
this
beer
is
crisp
has
a
clean
sweetness
and
finishes
with
class
a
floral
beauty
to
be
sure
my
taste
buds
have
been
seeking
a
hoppy
ipa
bitter
appreciation
as
of
late
but
2
bro
is
a
pleasant
change
to
my
recent
beersperation
so
to
speak
i
may
review
again
after
a
2nd
try
but
this
french
country
entry
is
good
just
not
sure
its
where
my
beer
mind
is
wandering
its
definitely
a
class
beer
and
i
need
to
grow
up
from
an
adjunct
mentality
to
a
classy
microbrew
entry
will
revisit
as
my
taste
buds
mature
in
a
world
of
every
changing
beerscape
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
french
country
ale
one
of
two
brothers
best
regular
offerings
its
a
great
change
of
pace
from
my
usual
goto
apasidekickipas
way
to
go
guys
highly
drinkable
with
a
great
flavor
a
very
enjoyable
brew
well
worth
trying
and
something
i
will
definitely
look
for
again
in
the
future
oa
well
balanced
ale
that
is
a
good
pairing
with
any
foods
pleasant
and
compliments
foods
but
does
not
cave
in
as
a
simple
beverage
it
is
distinct
enough
to
add
to
the
meal
as
a
component
and
not
simply
hydration
based
on
tasting
their
other
beers
there
is
no
indication
that
two
brothers
is
liable
to
change
their
philosophy
which
seems
to
be
make
it
different
but
different
doesnt
always
mean
better
this
is
a
very
safe
and
enjoyable
beer
it
has
all
of
the
characteristics
that
can
be
found
in
an
amber
ale
solid
brew
right
here
poured
into
grand
tulip
darker
orangeamber
with
a
medium
fizzy
white
head
that
dissipates
in
a
few
moments
leaving
some
scattered
lacing
smells
of
toasted
malt
with
slight
bitterness
and
some
leafy
notes
taste
is
nutty
toasted
malt
with
a
wet
clean
feel
to
it
reminds
me
of
a
wee
heavy
but
less
boozy
slight
twinge
of
crisp
hops
finishes
off
leaving
some
sticky
remnants
of
the
toasted
malt
behind
my
first
of
the
style
and
it
seems
tasty
a
strange
brew
here
to
dial
up
a
classic
rock
reference
this
morning
french
style
country
ale
was
i
naïve
to
think
this
was
going
to
be
a
saison
it
pours
a
surprising
maple
amber
color
with
only
a
little
cloudiness
and
a
very
short
lived
white
head
it
doesnt
look
or
smell
like
any
saison
ive
seen
instead
emitting
aromas
of
coppery
toasted
barley
and
an
acidic
wine
like
ester
that
must
come
from
the
yeast
the
flavor
isnt
so
abstract
its
pretty
much
an
amber
ale
on
the
malt
front
sweeter
a
tad
dry
and
caramel
or
toffee
teasing
the
yeast
makes
this
interesting
but
it
doesnt
totally
work
green
apple
tartness
and
a
funny
complexity
that
seems
an
accident
like
the
odd
mix
of
smells
in
well
used
dishwater
rather
than
a
meticulously
honed
fine
ale
still
the
final
product
doesnt
taste
bad
at
all
its
just
a
style
of
beer
i
wasnt
expecting
and
i
am
not
sure
what
it
is
it
seems
quite
far
from
the
traditional
biere
de
gardes
of
the
world
it
needed
more
carbonation
and
the
sweetness
was
an
out
of
place
last
note
i
did
enjoy
this
beer
in
retrospect
but
it
was
confusing
and
challenging
to
me
at
the
same
time
i
will
look
for
more
from
two
brothers
i
hope
so
too
as
i
do
not
want
to
be
duped
in
my
own
domain
having
learned
my
lesson
with
an
earlier
iteration
of
the
style
i
went
with
a
kinder
gentler
pour
on
this
one
i
ended
up
with
a
finger
of
foamy
deeptan
head
that
quickly
fell
away
to
wisps
color
was
an
elegant
deepamber
close
to
copper
with
nequality
clarity
speaking
of
nebraska
i
recently
got
turned
onto
both
literally
and
figuratively
val
midwest
a
young
lady
from
lincoln
who
has
an
adult
website
and
recently
made
news
when
she
returned
to
her
catholic
high
school
for
an
afterhours
photo
shoot
the
nose
on
this
was
was
really
sweet
almost
syrupy
in
its
intensity
with
an
underlying
scent
of
dried
dark
fruits
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
the
taste
was
unexpectedly
less
sweet
than
i
had
anticipated
instead
it
had
a
fruity
quality
almost
like
fruitcake
in
fact
that
is
exactly
what
it
reminded
me
of
with
its
bready
malty
backbone
to
accompany
the
fruitiness
wild
finish
was
semisweet
and
actually
quite
refreshing
in
its
reserved
nature
this
had
the
potential
to
be
an
overthe
top
malt
bomb
but
the
masterful
use
of
the
yeast
really
worked
well
with
the
malt
i
would
recommend
giving
this
a
try
its
a
tasty
and
easy
drinking
beer
i
prefer
a
hoppier
or
less
sweet
beer
but
this
is
a
surely
a
great
starter
for
those
getting
into
craft
im
not
sure
what
separates
this
style
from
an
amber
ale
but
it
seemed
to
have
a
lot
in
common
i
enjoyed
it
quite
a
bit
o
how
many
french
country
ales
have
you
had
there
is
nothing
quite
like
it
you
must
try
this
overall
a
very
tasty
easy
drinking
brew
great
malthopcarbonation
balance
quenching
and
tasty
brew
o
have
only
had
a
few
of
this
style
but
definitely
the
best
i
have
had
so
far
would
definitely
be
a
goto
if
i
lived
in
chicago
area
overall
pretty
tasty
and
enjoyable
im
not
very
familiar
with
the
style
but
ill
definitely
try
more
french
countrybier
de
garde
to
get
a
better
sense
also
one
of
the
prettiest
ambercopper
colors
ive
seen
in
a
beer
this
poured
out
as
a
clear
amber
color
with
a
fluffy
white
head
on
top
the
retention
and
lacing
are
both
pretty
good
the
smell
is
light
moderate
malt
and
hop
aromas
here
the
smell
is
earthy
and
kind
of
sweet
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
earthy
decent
amount
of
malt
with
a
caramel
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
light
bodied
and
easy
to
drink
overall
its
a
decent
brew
on
tap
at
kickbacks
in
jax
poured
into
a
snifter
clear
copper
body
with
an
offwhite
head
moderate
retention
with
mostly
clear
lacing
aroma
includes
a
fresh
hop
blast
slight
caramel
malts
and
maybe
a
saisonlike
yeastiness
taste
includes
a
caramel
sweetness
some
candi
sugar
slight
hop
bitterness
and
again
a
saisonlike
yeast
taste
overall
a
tasty
beer
not
sure
how
close
to
style
it
is
but
not
bad
at
all
overall
nice
spicy
brew
which
nicely
follows
the
style
and
isnt
over
carbonated
like
i
feel
many
of
these
are
faintly
hazed
bright
reddish
coppery
hue
with
a
thin
bubbly
head
candies
fruit
nose
with
a
mild
earthiness
thin
up
front
but
oddly
the
body
gets
bigger
on
the
finish
rolling
smooth
medium
body
but
close
to
flat
sweet
fruitiness
with
a
coarse
grainy
flavor
finishes
with
mild
alcohol
heat
and
faint
woodiness
long
lingering
fruity
finish
balance
is
there
somewhat
leaning
on
the
sweet
side
interesting
and
good
beer
but
definitely
something
odd
about
it
not
as
clean
as
id
like
with
a
very
strange
mouth
presence
nothing
really
wrong
with
this
beer
but
nothing
going
on
as
well
style
wise
very
mellow
and
semi
sweet
type
of
style
i
can
drink
it
but
wont
seek
this
style
out
overall
if
this
is
what
they
serve
in
the
french
countryside
l
wouldnt
mind
spending
some
time
there
its
a
step
above
macro
meh
i
will
never
have
again
overall
my
first
offering
from
two
brothers
and
i
was
definitely
not
let
down
very
good
white
head
reddish
carmel
clear
colour
a
gentle
hop
aroma
with
a
decent
bitter
finish
o
ive
had
a
few
in
this
style
in
my
day
and
this
is
about
in
the
middle
ive
had
this
plenty
of
times
and
had
some
left
over
from
a
halloween
party
good
change
of
pace
for
my
tastes
a
tasty
little
farmhouse
ale
with
more
malt
than
many
saisons
and
more
hops
than
some
biere
de
gardes
well
priced
though
further
bottle
conditioning
might
improve
the
affair
this
is
a
real
good
ale
though
and
it
was
really
good
good
autumn
beer
oa
style
i
think
is
underrated
a
solid
brew
not
great
but
gotta
give
props
to
people
who
brew
biere
de
gardes
overall
an
impressive
beer
in
a
style
that
is
not
seen
too
often
in
the
us
there
is
a
lot
of
depth
to
this
beer
and
a
whole
lot
going
on
definitely
one
to
pick
up
if
you
get
the
chance
o
an
ok
beer
a
bit
better
than
what
id
consider
average
the
moniker
french
style
country
ale
is
more
wordy
than
a
bière
de
garde
needs
to
be
no
matters
its
easy
enough
to
drink
enjoyed
a
couple
of
these
at
the
cookout
last
month
and
was
happy
to
have
had
another
predinner
on
a
monday
at
home

oaky

spicy

a

its

pleasant
but
the
sweetness
gets
to
be
too
much
towards
the
end
still
a
nice
offering
from
my
local
brewery
overall
yes
this
beer
employs
a
biscuity
malt
character
which
i
dont
love
however
it
is
well
puttogether
and
for
a
beer
as
biscuity
as
this
is
not
bad
at
all
o
tastes
like
a
strange
french
craft
ale
version
of
many
lagers
overly
sweet
and
slightly
unpleasant
flavors
that
linger
on
your
palate
it
needs
more
lightness
of
flavor
not
just
mouthfeel
the
flavors
arent
big
and
bold
but
they
feel
too
heavy
drink
overall
a
nice
light
creamy
and
refreshing
biere
de
garde
paired
this
with
a
blue
cheesewalnut
spinach
salad
and
a
grilled
artichoke
beer
pours
deep
orange
with
a
very
small
off
white
head
smells
like
black
tea
with
some
sweet
floral
presence
tastes
just
as
the
nose
lets
on
tea
upfront
that
mellows
out
very
nice
floral
taste
with
some
ripe
citrus
fruit
notes
mouthfeel
is
very
thin
with
a
very
active
carbonation
overall
pretty
good
session
beer
and
very
glad
i
got
to
try
it
overall
decent
nothing
to
strong
or
overpowering
about
this
beer
the
farmhouse
flavors
are
mild
and
smooth
yet
theres
enough
bitter
and
sourness
in
it
its
worth
a
drink
and
the
price
is
really
nice
too
overall
the
smell
is
nicely
balanced
but
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
fall
a
little
short
o
net
sweet
profile
with
great
complexity
very
approachable
could
be
a
great
introductory
beer
for
somebody
just
into
craft
along
the
lines
of
an
amber
but
more
wellrounded
balanced
overall
not
a
bad
bière
de
garde
plenty
of
toasted
malt
sour
and
sweet
malts
to
make
it
very
enjoyable
mouthfeel
is
light
and
smooth
overall
pretty
good
overall
a
nice
simple
table
beer
would
pair
just
fine
with
an
appetizer
of
cheeses
and
light
citrus
vinaigrette
based
club
salad
the
copperamber
colored
brew
is
capped
with
a
nice
cream
cap
of
foam
which
left
plenty
of
lacing
down
the
glass
the
aroma
is
a
mixture
of
caramel
mixed
with
the
essence
of
sweet
fruit
some
trailing
spice
opens
the
senses
creamy
malt
flavors
biscuit
mostly
pervade
the
palate
experience
muted
hops
at
the
end
contribute
some
dried
herbal
flavors
this
is
a
decent
stab
at
the
style
but
i
would
like
to
see
a
bit
more
earthiness
o
malt
strong
but
well
balanced
hops
really
only
provide
bittering
balance
that
lasts
through
the
finish
complexity
hides
deep
within
this
oaklaced
beer
giving
it
supreme
drinkability
something
to
savor
and
sip
exploring
its
depth
i
find
the
domaine
dupage
to
be
true
to
its
style
and
quite
tasty
o
i
have
never
had
anything
from
two
brothers
before
so
i
didnt
quite
know
what
to
expect
this
beer
is
a
nice
surprise
if
this
was
a
bomber
it
would
be
a
great
table
beer
for
a
family
dinner
as
it
stands
its
a
nice
example
of
a
farmhouse
ale
that
doesnt
try
to
do
too
much
yet
is
wellexecuted
i
would
have
this
again
and
i
would
be
open
to
trying
other
beers
from
two
brothers

without

domaine
dupage
was
one
of
my
first
two
brothers
beers
a
great
beer
from
one
of
my
local
brewers
domaine
dupage
is
a
standby
for
me
around
here
as
many
restaurants
in
the
area
have
begun
serving
it
lately
overall
i
dont
have
much
to
compare
it
to
but
it
seems
like
a
great
mélange
of
englishstyle
ale
and
bavarian
saison
i
have
to
give
it
props
for
hitting
spoton
the
farmhouse
feel
even
though
id
never
really
conceptualized
it
as
such
i
could
definitely
see
people
drinking
something
like
this
in
the
heat
of
the
summer
and
man
is
it
tasty
i
just
wish
i
could
get
my
hands
on
it
on
a
regular
basis
this
beer
is
copper
with
a
short
white
head
interspersed
among
a
nice
fine
layer
of
foam
are
a
handful
of
bigger
bubbles
there
is
a
bit
of
spotty
lacing
as
well
but
minimal
retention
aroma
is
biscuity
mildly
roast
and
a
bit
nutty
flavor
is
similar
with
a
mild
earthy
hop
note
and
a
nice
mildly
fruity
yeast
character
sort
of
verging
on
a
saisonish
character
but
a
bit
cleaner
definitely
goes
well
with
the
nutty
biscuit
from
the
malt
mouthfeel
is
light
and
effervescent
very
nice
and
refreshing
medium
light
bodied
but
the
carbonation
makes
it
much
more
drinkable
notes
moderate
in
body
with
a
very
creamy
mouthfeel
its
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
would
accompany
just
about
any
dish
its
nice
to
see
some
american
breweries
experimenting
with
this
style
very
enjoyable
brew
this
is
a
impressive
beer
i
recommend
this
one
for
sure

if
youre
looking
for
a
biere
de
garde
in
the
chicagoland
area
there
isnt
much
else
of
a
choice
besides
this
one
id
think
the
oaked
version
of
this
beer
would
be
killer
good
nice
clear
dark
ambercopper
body
a
off

rises
to
a
finger
and
a
half
tall
before
settling
to
a
frothy
cap
with
decent
retention
and
lacing
nose
is
mainly
big
bready
malts
with
hints
of
biscuits
and
caramel
the
tongue
picks
up
some
apple
and
pear
along
with
a
well
balanced
amount
of
hops
goes
down
nice
and
creamy
smooth
with
a
short
clean
finish
this
is
a
good
beer
that
pairs
well
with
anything
i
eat
with
it
highly
recommended
o
its
a
decent
beer
there
is
nothing
remarkable
about
it
but
it
is
worth
a
try
o
this
is
a
light
refreshing
beer
that
has
an
above
average
drinkability
while
the
flavors
were
mostly
subtle
it
still
had
a
nice
taste
and
i
could
drink
several
in
one
sitting
light
to
medium
bodied
with
very
active
carbonation
this
beer
is
oddly
not
as
refreshing
as
one
would
expect
the
body
is
just
light
enough
to
allow
the
flavors
to
remain
delicate
the
carbonation
fizzes
away
on
your
tongue
at
every
point
during
the
sip
and
almost
gives
this
beer
a
sparkling
quality
overall
the
beer
is
very
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
light
in
flavor
yet
complex
enough
to
keep
you
wanting
more
i
wish
this
was
available
in
my
area
pours
a
hazy
orangeish
to
copper
color
with
an
off

head
in
the

mellow
gingerbread
note
but
very
faint
inthe
aroma
a
faint

bite
and
medium
to
lighter
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
small
dry
spice
in
the
aftertaste
ok
but
really
nothing
notable
this
is
usually
a
good
go
to
for
me
very
good
and
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
oi
keep
an
eye
out
for
this
and
have
a
corner
spot
of
my
mixed
six
reserved
for
this
one
i
am
excited
about
exploring
all
of
the
two
brothers
varieties
that
are
becoming
available
to
the
ny
area
d
good
taste
and
easy
to
enjoy
light
flavor
profile
characteristics
make
this
beer
enjoyable
any
time
of
the
year
i
will
admit
that
this
is
definitely
a
hard
beer
to
make
out
carbonation
is
good
body
is
mediumthin
sort
of
a
short
and
snappy
finish
refreshing
but
not
as
much
as
id
hoped
this
brewery
makes
2
beers
at
least
that
are
even
more
quenching
and
drinkable
the
dog
days
dortmunder
style
and
the
ebels
weiss
domaine
dupage
is
nice
but
simple
and
unexceptional
saved
to
a
degree
by
its
unexpected
bitterness
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
easy
to
drink
it
is
a
little
too
sweet
for
what
i
enjoy
i
like
the
relatively
mild
carbonation
and
smoothness
i
also
like
the
rustic
fell
to
it
as
well
overall
this
is
truly
a
winning
beer
ive
been
an
ipa
drinker
for
a
while
and
ive
recently
discovered
my
passion
for
stouts
and
porters
i
would
recommend
this
to
absolutely
anyone
remotely
interested
in
beer
overall
impression
a
fantastic
biere
de
garde
i
actually
havent
had
this
style
in
a
while
so
it
was
nice
to
remember
how
much
i
like
this
style
my
second
brew
from
two
brothers
and
am
a
huge
fan
of
theirs
go
for
this
if
you
can
find
it
o
a
good
try
from
an
american
brewer
on
a
biere
de
garde
interesting
enough
to
try
again
first
sampling
of
a
two
brothers
beer
pours
a
pretty
enough
orange
with
a
little
bit
of
head
but
once
i
get
down
to
enjoying
the
beer
theres
just
no
there
there
nothing
unpleasant
aromatically
or
tastewise
just
bland
very
bland
left
a
strong
impression
the
brewers
were
afraid
of
the
flavors
they
were
using
more
power
to
the
hundreds
that
have
positive
feelings
for
this
beer
i
just
didnt
get
it
the
taste
is
great
starts
malty
and
than
the
caramel
dark
fruit
and
a
slight
sweetness
hits
aftertaste
is
a
nice
balance
of
malt
and
light
hops
quite
tasty
and
refreshing
i
think
i
need
to
try
another
if
thats
any
indication
alcohollytoased
almond
to

roasted
taste

as
warms
to
lemony

and
a

finish
moderately
carbonated
do
this
beers
marketing
is
very
eraappropriateten
years
ago
it
would
have
been
labeled
an
amber
without
another
look
but
now
the
label
seeks
to
appeal
to
our
burgeoning
awareness
of
the
table
beers
bearing
some
nebulous
nationality
in
all
truth
any
comparison
to
new
belgiums
ubiquitous
fat
tire
ale
is
appropriate
but
the
comparer
must
admit
that
this
is
retooled
with
an
eye
toward
depth
the
two
beers
are
similar
and
both
are
probably
equally
approachable
and
userfriendly
the
difference
is
the
real
depth
present
here
with
layers
of
roast
and
umami
underneath
the
heavy
biscuit
that
makes
this
so
much
more
repeatable
id
consider
this
a
nice
beer
to
pair
with
food
but
not
something
that
stands
out
by
itself
next
time
why
dont
you
try
a
french
style
country
ale
before
you
try
and
make
one
because
if
i
did
know
any
better
this
brewery
just
puts
what
ever
they
feel
like
on
their
labels
this
is
the
second
beer
i
have
had
from
two
brothers
and
will
most
certainly
be
my
last
o
overall
a
very
nice
beer
seems
like
every
beer
that
i
have
had
in
this
style
is
quite
different
so
i
have
no
idea
how
well
this
fits
the
style
but
his
is
a
nice
easy
drinking
brew
overall
while
it
may
be
true
that
this
beer
doesnt
adequately
represent
the
flavors
present
in
a
frenchstyle
country
ale
it
is
still
a
wellflavored
and
nicely
balanced
brew
and
worth
a
taste
this
is
a
flavorful
unique
mediumbodied
beer
that
i
could
easily
drink
more
than
a
few
of
in
one
session
then
note
that
its
at
the
lower
end
of
the
price
and
abv
spectrum
these
days
and
i
find
this
a
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
beer
i
particularly
enjoyed
this
one
after
dinner
so
perhaps
a
very
good
digestif
o
this
is
a
beer
i
expected
to
drink
like
a
heavier
autumn
brew
but
had
some
thinner
properties
that
made
it
more
sessionable
than
i
expected
i
like
the
combination
of
earthy
malt
but
i
was
missing
the
stronger
lingering
robust
flavors
of
the
style
a
well
done
beer
that
was
very
easy
to
drink
with
nice
flavors
but
they
were
a
bit
thinned
out
i
am
not
familiar
with
this
style
so
have
to
review
this
mainly
based
on
how
it
tastes
to
me
it
does
remind
me
a
bit
of
a
wheat
beer
has
that
bread
like
smell
and
taste
i
associate
with
that
style
its
really
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
one
that
made
me
stand
up
and
take
notice
either
trying
a
domaine
dupage
from
two
bros
little
dissappointed
that
my
beer
has
floaters
in
it
not
a
fan
of
floaters
the
color
is
rich
amber
with
creamy
off
white
head
floaters
are
white
the
smell
is
malty
yet
sweet
this
is
a
very
light
bodied
beer
that
has
good
flavor
the
sweetness
helps
to
carry
the
beer
across
the
pallet
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
and
it
would
probably
go
great
with
many
different
food
pairings
overall
i
like
2bros
i
really
do
but
this
beer
is
just
no
good
most
of
their
regularsseasonal
are
appropriate
and
faithful
representations
of
their
respective
styles
but
domaine
dupage
is
just
poor
it
is
unbalanced
harsh
and
tough
to
finish
grab
a
ce
or
resistance
if
you
want
to
see
2bros
at
their
finest
this
is
them
at
their
weakest
d
not
bad
a
nice
rustic
feel
to
it
with
an
overall
smooth
body
not
only
will
i
have
this
again
but
i
will
go
through
their
line
after
this
and
their
fine
dortmunder
as
well
seems
like
they
are
thinking
outside
of
the
box
and
doing
a
good
job
at
it
overall
not
a
great
beer
if
i
had
bought
a
6
pack
id
probably
drain
pour
it
one
drink
is
enough
for
me
the
sourbitterness
just
kills
it
for
me
i
might
be
open
to
trying
again
but
not
for
a
while
overall
you
dont
see
a
biere
de
garde
every
day
especially
from
an
american
brewer
but
two
brothers
as
usual
did
something
a
little
unusual
with
this
brew
and
it
works
very
well
it
is
slightly
on
the
sweet
side
for
me
these
days
and
im
not
sure
i
could
knock
down
more
than
a
couple
in
one
sitting
because
of
that
but
to
have
one
or
two
is
certainly
a
treat
o
this
beer
is
a
nice
departure
from
the
different
ales
and
lagers
available
very
complex
in
character
yet
not
so
much
happening
that
its
distracting
the
light
sour
character
could
be
a
bit
surprising
to
craft
beer
novices
but
the
malt
backbone
balances
the
flavors
well
poured
this
french
country
ale
into
a
pint
glass
from
a
12
oz
bottle
this
is
the
first
time
i
have
tried
this
style
the
beer
poured
a
clear
slightly
amber
straw
color
it
produced
a
nice
white
head
and
had
average
lacing
the
aroma
of
the
beer
was
sweet
smelled
of
fresh
baked
bread
and
had
a
hint
of
spice
that
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
the
aroma
was
wonderful
one
of
the
best
smelling
beers
that
i
have
ever
had
the
taste
was
malty
a
little
bready
slightly
dry
and
had
notes
of
raisins
and
pear
there
was
some
bitterness
from
hops
that
melded
with
the
other
flavors
very
complex
beer
awesome
i
will
be
looking
for
this
again
in
fact
a
road
trip
might
be
in
order
o
a
fair
introduction
to
an
uncommon
style
i
dont
think
this
will
ever
become
one
of
my
favorite
types
of
beer
but
who
knows
i
can
certainly
say
that
this
one
grew
on
me
from
first
sip
to
last
whos
to
say
what
change
a
few
years
might
bring
to
my
palate
ill
keep
my
eyes
open
for
beers
of
a
similar
style
to
see
what
i
end
up
deciding
such
is
the
adventure
that
is
craft
beer
hmm
biere
de
garde
makes
sense
with
the
esters
i
was
smelling
this
was
a
unique
beer
as
it
really
showcased
the
caramel
in
the
malt
and
is
not
a
beer
for
someone
that
is
not
a
fan
of
caramel
i
can
only
imagine
how
long
of
a
brewday
it
takes
for
that
much
caramelization
to
occur
thanks
to
davideddie
for
the
awesome
extra
a
delicious
surprise
i
will
seek
this
out
again
and
look
for
others
from
this
brewery
this
is
a
brew
of
which
i
had
a
second
bottle
im
thinking
this
is
something
i
would
recommend
but
simple
as
something
with
a
chicken
or
pasta
dish
not
as
a
beer
to
sit
and
enjoy
in
sucession
o
its
light
has
a
pleasant
flavor
and
is
easy
drinking
but
it
isnt
that
memorable
a
good
beer
but
nothing
more
than
that
not
that
it
aims
to
be
nothing
wrong
with
that
this
would
definitely
hit
the
spot
on
a
warm
day
when
i
just
want
something
light
and
refreshing
to
go
with
a
nice
rustic
pizza
pork
sandwich
sausage
pasta
etc
mouthfeel
is
fine
nothing
objectionable
at
all
its
not
outstanding
but
good
overall
its
not
a
bad
deal
and
i
like
to
support
local
breweries
but
i
cant
recommend
it
unfortunately
overall
great
beer
this
is
a
nice
one
to
always
have
a
6
pack
around
the
house
because
i
find
women
and
men
who
are
not
fans
of
hoppy
or
very
strong
beers
like
it
flavor
seems
to
be
to
style
but
not
really
enjoyable
aroma
is
lacking
any
sort
of
hoppiness
overall
not
a
fan
of
this
beer
although
it
still
gets
style
points
4
5
d
not
to
astringent
very
nice
balance
to
it
well
done
all
around
i
found
this
beer
to
be
very
dull
not
much
flavor
to
it
at
all
disappointed
in
it
and
do
not
plan
on
drinking
it
again
unless
someone
can
convince
me
its
a
lot
better
than
this
bottle
i
had
thinking
maybe
i
was
drinking
it
too
cold
i
let
it
warm
up
but
then
it
tasted
worse
stronger
but
more
unpleasant
flavors
down
the
drain
it
goes
o
great
drinkability
good
beer
nothing
special
about
it
it
has
a
good
taste
for
a
good
price
id
buy
it
again
overall
i
liked
this
beer
a
great
deal
i
had
no
idea
what
to
expect
in
terms
of
style
and
i
ended
up
liking
it
i
wish
the
nose
had
been
a
bit
more
potent
but
other
than
that
two
brothers
has
a
nice
little
gem
on
their
hands
here
o
a
slightly
spicy
easy
to
drink
ale
would
be
a
good
session
ale
for
a
fall
night
tap
poured
a
hazy
medium
beige
color
ale
with
nice
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
lacing
aroma
consists
of
lightly
aromatic
belgian
style
malt
with
light
rustic
ester
taste
is
also
dominated
by
semisweet
belgianstyle
malt
with
light
rustic
notes
body
is
quite
full
with
limited
filtration
and
good
carbonation
enjoyable
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
overall
an
interesting
beer
nice
for
the
warmer
spring
and
summer
as
i
believe
the
nice
body
fruity
aspects
would
make
a
wonderfully
tasty
balanced
beerss
finish
is
a
little
off
for
me
comes
across
a
little
caustic
in
the
back
of
the
mouth
drinkability
is
good
this
is
a
well
executed
clean
bdg
with
the
classic
notes
to
satisfy
d
very
nice
as
this
is
what
i
think
is
my
first
bieredegarde
i
will
consider
it
a
style
to
look
for
and
will
definitely
revisit
this
after
trying
a
few
others
solid
brew
the
aroma
was
rich
and
spicy
lots
of
yeast
present
here
but
at
the
same
time
very
sweet
with
hardly
atouch
of
alcohol
rich
caramel
malty
notes
prevelant
throught
really
making
a
difference
here
the
flavor
was
very
smooth
with
a
rich
sweet
character
coming
through
and
balanced
well
against
a
dark
fruity
yeast
character
nice
notes
of
pums
and
raisins
throughout
this
one
really
offering
quite
a
bit
of
depth
here
as
it
warmed
a
bit
of
spicy
rum
like
flavor
cae
out
with
a
touch
of
peppery
like
alcohol
but
very
nicely
done
very
smooth
texture
and
very
highly
carbonated
this
as
definitly
a
good
choice
here
it
was
highly
drinkable
and
made
an
excellent
sipper
that
was
for
sure
dafter
finishing
1the
end
note
of
hops
and
alcohol
bite
limit
the
drinkability
a
bit
for
me
d
pretty
decent
i
wonder
what
this
would
be
like
with
food
for
two
reasons
1
the
rubberrubbing
afterfeel
might
disappear
with
a
meal
and
2
the
taste
might
seem
even
weaker
than
it
does
here
and
i
havent
eaten
for
about
three
hours
at
5
9
it
could
be
a
good
one
with
which
to
begin
an
evening
of
moderate
debauchery
as
opposed
to
heavy
or
even
wild
debauchery
obviously
i
would
buy
it
again
but
only
after
its
next
release
to
see
how
it
changes
not
a
beer
style
ventured
into
by
many
american
brewers
a
crisplooking
ale
clear
brassy
color
with
a
tight
tinybubbled
lacing
candied
fruit
white
chocolate
shortbread
mild
spice
and
wildflowers
blow
all
expectations
out
of
the
water
a
godly
aroma
dried
malt
character
blankets
the
palate
a
bit
biscuity
but
more
of
a
dried
grass
flavor
fruitiness
abounds
with
hints
of
pear
cider
baked
apples
and
golden
raisins
with
a
hint
of
alcohol
within
bubblegum
herbal
hop
flavor
and
a
small
measure
of
bitterness
checks
any
sweetness
that
may
have
lingered
super
tasty
hunt
this
beer
down
and
get
a
semistinky
cheese
to
throw
it
at
very
drinkable
excellent
for
summertime
even
though
amber
can
be
such
an
all
encompassing
term
and
i
am
not
sure
if
this
beer
falls
into
this
catagory
this
is
what
i
expect
an
amber
to
be
most
amber
ales
leave
me
disapointed
but
this
one
no
way
try
it
i
really
enjoy
the
malt
character
and
the
mouthfeel
again
very
easy
to
drink
and
a
nice
beer
overall
it
almost
seems
flat
its
so
smooth
with
an
exceptionally
clean
finish
and
hardly
any
bite
or
aftertaste
i
had
to
knock
it
down
a
little
since
the
carbonation
in
a
biere
de
garde
is
supposed
to
be
higher
the
bitterness
is
really
low
and
their
label
does
list
the
ibus
as
24
about
the
label
putting
brown
print
on
a
tan
background
with
a
tiny
font
may
result
in
a
class
action
lawsuit
for
excessive
eye
strain
who
reads
that
stuff
us
beer
geeks
thats
who
this
is
even
harder
to
read
than
the
novels
that
greg
from
stone
writes
on
his
bottles
drinkability
good
session
beer
excellent
for
your
friends
that
really
are
just
getting
into
craft
beer
mouthfeel
drinkablity
a
very
drinkable
biere
de
garde
light
to
medium
bodied
a
slight
ethanol
taste
is
present
as
i
continue
to
drink
one
of
my
favorite
biere
de
gards
ive
had
drinkability
is
high
on
this
one
due
to
a
very
crisp
refreshing
taste
and
low
alcohol
content
d
goes
down
easy
due
to
mild
flavors
will
have
to
try
again
first
time
for
this
style
note
at
times
it
reminded
me
of
a
ambervienne
lager
drunkability
really
wouldnt
want
to
drink
this
beer
unless
i
was
eating
a
meal
the
taste
alone
isnt
desirable
but
the
toasted
malts
would
really
complement
a
diverse
range
of
foods
the
drinkability
looses
points
for
the
excess
bitterness
but
otherwise
is
very
good
the
taste
is
a
mix
of
incredibly
unique
and
boringly
standard
the
standard
is
the
basic
ale
taste
but
the
unique
is
it
has
a
long
lasting
chocolate
and
blueberry
note
but
the
mouth
feel
is
wonderful
and
its
flavor
is
quite
intriguing
to
the
point
that
it
is
wonderfully
drinkable
d
this
is
an
exceptional
allseason
beer
and
i
will
definitely
seek
it
out
again
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
the
malt
character
is
dominant
but
the
sweetness
is
not
overpowering
taste
is
complex
i
could
only
do
a
couple
at
once
but
i
would
enjoy
every
sip
loved
it
d
i
thought
this
was
a
pretty
good
beer
the
smell
improved
a
lot
as
it
warmed
up
and
i
enjoyed
the
caramel
and
toasted
malts
in
the
taste
would
certainly
have
again
drinkability
definitely
drinkable
this
would
be
the
type
of
beer
that
would
grow
on
me
upon
further
consumption
at
5
9
it
is
not
unreasonable
to
have
a
few
d
decent
session
experience
worth
another
try
overall
it
is
enough
to
make
me
seek
out
this
brewerys
beers
a
little
more
now
i
am
a
illinois
native
so
that
should
not
be
to
hard
of
a
task
next
up
will
be
heavy
handed
d
this
beer
might
have
been
a
little
off
and
i
will
review
it
when
i
get
another
bottle
for
now
this
beer
is
a
horrible
drinker
and
i
think
they
did
not
hit
the
style
at
all
oh
well
some
people
might
like
this
but
not
me
d
this
is
damn
drinkable
a
real
beautiful
subtle
beer
edit
3242012
tried
this
again
and
ws
not
as
impressed
as
in
2011
it
was
still
good
but
didnt
make
as
big
an
impression
as
last
time
not
sure
if
this
is
due
to
variability
in
the
brewing
or
an
artifact
of
the
style
biere
du
gardes
have
been
quite
variable
in
my
experience
d
its
a
really
easy
beer
to
drink
and
to
start
the
night
off
pours
dark
amber
dark
for
the
style
but
with
a
fine
white
head
that
sticks
around
for
awhile
and
leaves
some
nice
lacing
smells
a
bit
grainy
like
brown
bread
with
some
earthy
hops
and
some
brown
sugar
glazed
pears
the
taste
is
very
nice
quite
balanced
with
some
slightly
sweet
grainy
malt
some
notes
of
banana
and
pear
and
some
more
earthy
hops
as
well
as
a
touch
of
brandied
citron
on
the
end
that
intermingles
nicely
with
the
long
somewhat
bitter
earthiness
very
smooth
and
silky
in
the
mouth
with
just
a
touch
of
tartness
a
very
nice
beer
cant
believe
its
taken
me
this
long
to
try
it
my
all
time
favorite
beer
on
tap
at
the
two
brothers
brewery
or
out
of
the
bottle
this
is
a
smooth
well
finished
beer
great
taste
and
drinkable
all
year
winter
spring
summer
or
fall
this
is
a
great
year
round
beer
i
would
recommend
that
you
visit
the
two
brothers
brewery
and
have
the
tap
house
burger
its
a
great
burger
with
roasted
fresh
jalapenos
peppers
folded
into
12
pound
of
awesome
beef
its
the
best
way
to
spend
an
afternoon
on
a
cold
winter
day
in
chicago
revisited
5102014
this
french
style
country
ale
pours
a
medium
brown
with
a
long
lasting
head
on
it
there
is
a
decent
scent
of
malts
to
it
upon
drinking
it
has
a
semiheavy
taste
of
roasted
malts
with
a
slight
hint
of
honey
and
spices
an
interesting
beer
to
come
out
of
illinois
d
this
one
must
not
be
for
me
i
thought
it
was
pretty
odd
and
just
hard
for
me
to
drink
good
luck
pretty
decent
drinkability
but
the
sweetness
could
get
cloying
after
1
for
me
came
in
expecting
one
thing
and
got
another
oh
well
im
not
gonna
argue
too
much
whatever
you
call
it
it
pours
a
hazy
rubyamber
topped
by
nearly
a
finger
of
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
mandarin
oranges
and
brown
toffee
nothing
more
nothing
less
the
taste
holds
notes
of
cedar
light
toffee
greens
cloves
oranges
and
mild
butter
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
sorta
dry
finish
overall
a
nice
brew
nothing
truly
special
but
pretty
tasty
regardless
d
a
good
beer
with
good
qualities
nothing
outstanding
but
a
good
staple
for
this
style
this
beer
is
served
a
cloudy
reddish
orange
with
an
off
white
foam
on
the
surface
the
smell
is
perhaps
a
sour
oak
that
compliments
the
hop
and
malt
characters
the
taste
is
a
mirror
of
the
smell
with
the
addition
of
some
oranges
and
a
grassy
or
almost
onion
like
taste
this
beer
is
slightly
bitter
on
the
palate
but
that
doesnt
really
hinder
the
drinkability
of
the
beer
it
is
a
solid
beer
drinkability
a
great
beer
in
both
flavor
and
style
the
beer
pours
a
coppery
amber
color
has
some
yeast
floating
in
it
the
head
on
this
beer
is
a
frothy
white
color
the
aroma
smells
of
bread
biscuits
and
malt
the
taste
is
of
caramel
baking
bread
and
biscuits
the
lingering
taste
is
of
biscuits
the
hops
arent
really
noticeable
but
there
is
a
hint
of
noble
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
in
between
light
and
medium
not
as
thick
as
a
brown
ale
with
this
being
a
malty
sweet
beer
it
is
very
drinkable
i
had
a
draft
of
this
at
rattle
and
hum
in
manhattans
mid
town
it
was
among
the
many
beers
i
hadnt
tried
a
very
pleasant
but
not
outstanding
beer
very
light
in
color
with
a
great
and
brisk
head
aroma
is
yeasty
as
it
should
be
and
the
flavor
is
very
refreshing
and
an
easy
drink
at
5
9
percent
alcohol
by
volume
each
mouthful
starts
out
very
promising
with
some
golden
malty
sweetness
but
ends
in
a
stew
of
funky
flavors
hinting
at
musty
and
metallic
very
interesting
and
worth
a
try
but
a
pint
would
be
too
much
of
a
good
thing

everything
is

drinkable
2brithers
from
il
makes
some
nice
brews
recommended
d
other
than
the
harsh
and
unpleasant
carbonation
this
is
reasonably
drinkable
doubt
id
ever
buy
it
again
but
its
not
a
bad
beer
drinkability
we
both
agreed
this
was
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
i
wish
i
had
both
more
bottles
and
larger
bottles
perhaps
it
was
just
having
a
nice
break
from
the
other
monsters
we
opened
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
slightly
fruity
and
semidry
in
the
swallow
im
a
huge
fan
of
this
style
and
this
example
doesnt
disappoint
in
conclusion
i
like
all
kinds
of
beers
but
this
one
is
not
too
light
or
too
heavy
it
is
good
on
its
own
or
with
any
meal
i
enjoyed
it
very
much
this
was
one
of
my
early
introductions
to
good
beer
drove
about
an
hour
and
a
half
to
the
brewery
from
my
college
to
get
a
pencil
keg
of
domain
dupage
d
this
is
an
okay
beer
with
moments
of
greatness
but
it
ultimately
falls
a
bit
short
because
of
the
simplicity
and
lack
of
a
certain
funk
that
i
am
accustomed
to
in
my
bier
de
gardes
the
key
word
here
is
complex
this
is
a
good
beer
very
malty
in
general
well
aged
beers
like
the
gardemars
ales
should
have
a
level
of
depth
complexity
and
maturity
that
is
lacking
from
this
sugartooth
of
a
beer
i
appreciate
the
character
of
the
sweetness
that
focuses
on
the
whisping
powdered
sugar
impressions
but
this
level
of
intensity
and
lack
of
balance
or
depth
its
tough
to
celebrate
i
cant
help
but
close
my
eyes
and
see
visions
of
musty
cellars
crumbling
corks
and
dusty
bottles
stone
bridges
a
log
on
the
fire
strong
cheeses
the
sounds
of
an
accordion
a
poetic
language
warm
scarves
and
the
inexplicable
desire
to
make
love
if
it
can
instill
all
that
it
stands
to
reason
domaine
dupage
is
one
of
the
strongest
examples
of
the
biere
de
garde
style
commercially
available
thanks
sam
for
the
beer
and
vacation
overall
its
a
good
biere
de
garde
that
i
recommend
if
you
like
the
style
not
available
here
in
tx
so
shipped
back
from
my
indy
trip
rotation
i
enjoyed
it
but
really
didnt
make
me
yearn
for
another
so
good
with
one
unless
i
could
easily
get
another
or
try
it
ontap
no
d
good
balanced
and
easy
to
drink
id
like
to
explore
this
genre
of
beer
a
bit
more
conclusion
this
came
highly
recommended
from
a
friend
who
generally
knows
her
beers
and
by
several
people
here
on
ba
i
dunno
maybe
i
dont
get
the
style
but
i
loved
schlaflys
biere
de
garde
and
thought
that
the
oddball
that
is
jenlain
noel
was
pretty
tasty
as
well
maybe
this
ones
just
not
for
me
d
very
smooth
with
excellent
balance
clean
flavors
and
easy
on
the
palate
if
i
find
myself
traveling
west
i
would
certainly
pick
some
up
thanks
nate
o
a
little
disappointed
with
this
selection
overall
a
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
country
ale
overall
nothing
real
special
drinkable
but
not
memorable
d
liked
it
to
me
this
style
is
all
over
the
place
but
it
grew
on
me
after
a
few
sips
good
strong
toasty
tastes
and
a
certain
wildness
to
it
quite
spicy
in
taste
malty
caramel
not
much
hop
not
bad
crisp
on
taste
but
also
a
post
caramel
creaminess
moderate
carbonation
prickles
the
tongue
the
beer
leaves
an
ever
so
slight
aftertaste
not
cloying
but
pleasing
this
is
one
very
drinkable
beer
d
a
unique
but
tasty
beer
this
is
refreshing
and
well
made
and
it
has
given
the
perception
of
a
sweet
beer
at
first
then
comes
off
bitter
dry
and
clean
i
would
easily
drink
another
d
this
is
actually
a
really
decent
brew
worth
every
penny
i
spent
on
it
biere
de
garde
woulda
never
guessed
since
that
style
seems
to
be
a
crap
shoot
whatever
you
concider
this
its
good
poured
into
a
tulp
glass
was
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
white
head
that
laced
away
aroma
was
of
malt
cane
sugar
and
oak
not
heavily
carbonated
flavors
included
light
amounts
of
saaz
hops
coriander
and
malt
slightly
bitter
and
a
light
sweetness
notes
this
is
a
great
beer
for
people
who
like
wine
i
had
shared
a
bottle
of
this
with
my
mom
who
drinks
mostly
wine
and
had
never
ventured
into
the
vast
craft
beer
style
world
and
after
this
one
she
was
interested
in
trying
other
styles
and
we
did
d
fairly
easy
to
drink
but
the
mustiness
was
not
what
i
was
in
the
mood
for
right
now
d
very
balanced
and
easy
to
get
along
with
but
remains
interesting
throughout
will
definitely
buy
again
lots
of
character
to
domaine
dupage
a
pleasure
to
drink
and
an
incentive
to
explore
other
biere
de
garde
offerings
overall
this
is
a
crazy
good
beer
would
definitely
drink
more
of
this
very
rough
yet
refined
great
a
hard
pour
into
a
standard
pint
glass
produced
a
half
inch
offwhite
head
that
faded
into
a
ring
pretty
quickly
appearance
redish
orange
and
a
little
hazy
not
much
aroma
at
first
but
after
warming
up
it
has
a
nice
sweet
malty
nose
with
a
little
butterscotch
or
caramel
taste
reflects
the
smell
with
the
addition
of
a
fairly
prominent
alcohol
taste
and
some
slight
hop
bitterness
at
the
end
very
tasty
i
would
say
not
complex
at
all
but
thats
no
slam
as
others
have
said
it
has
a
creamy
mouthfeel
that
complements
the
flavor
the
sweetness
may
wear
on
some
but
i
like
some
sweet
beers
and
this
one
is
pretty
drinkable
i
also
love
the
fact
that
for
me
this
is
a
local
beer
d
it
was
rather
drinkable
but
if
i
have
this
again
i
would
probably
pair
it
with
food
the
beer
becomes
a
bit
more
drinkable
as
it
warms
up
a
very
enjoyable
beer
theres
nothing
about
it
that
says
excellence
but
is
definitely
above
average
to
good
in
all
areas
not
bad
at
all
enjoyable
but
not
a
lot
going
on
just
a
simple
sweetness
dominates
worth
a
try
altogether
pretty
nice
while
not
the
most
complex
farmhouse
ale
what
was
there
was
very
enjoyable
if
given
the
opportunity
id
probably
go
for
another
one
drinkability
is
nice
very
tasty
and
enjoyable
the
alcohol
comes
through
fairly
noticeably
for
the
abv
which
is
distracting
but
doesnt
get
in
the
way
too
too
much
overall
a
very
tasty
beer
d
this
beer
has
an
understated
complexity
to
it
that
makes
it
especially
interesting
and
tasty
this
is
the
first
brew
ive
had
from
two
brothers
and
now
i
want
to
try
more
very
impressed
for
sure
not
a
beer
you
need
to
seek
out
in
fact
there
are
probably
others
you
have
access
to
that
are
much
better
that
i
would
drink
over
this
not
bad
just
bland
overall
a
pretty
delicious
beer
certainly
a
unique
style
i
havent
had
much
of
balanced
and
complex
d
very
good
drinkabilty
ive
heard
good
things
about
this
and
they
were
wright
im
glad
i
finally
picked
it
up
and
gave
it
a
try
i
would
recommend
this
beer
drinkability
this
was
a
really
fun
beer
to
drink
dark
fruits
caramel
malts
yeasty
funk
its
really
reminiscent
of
belgian
ales
with
a
much
higher
abv
i
dont
mind
malty
beers
but
i
found
it
a
little
unbalanced
in
that
you
really
dont
detect
much
hop
presence
until
the
finish
i
would
say
true
hopheads
need
not
apply
but
otherwise
check
it
out
m
lightish
body
with
prickly
carbonation
d
this
beer
is
one
of
those
that
is
nightandday
better
when
its
fresh
and
ontap
i
have
had
some
bottles
that
just
didnt
do
it
for
me
but
this
bar
serves
this
beer
super
fresh
and
its
delicious
drinkability
not
really
true
to
the
style
the
best
that
i
can
tell
but
willing
to
try
again
as
it
was
a
decent
brew
d
a
little
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
decent
representation
of
style
its
a
fairly
solid
beer
overall
but
there
are
better
beers
in
the
style
that
i
would
select
before
this
one
do
wants
to
be
a
56
session
beer
more
than
i
wanted
it
to
hate
to
say
forgettable
about
any
craft
brew
but
i
was
let
down
with
this
offering
d
not
the
best
beer
i
have
ever
had
but
something
i
can
stomach
very
easy
to
drink
if
someone
is
not
into
craft
beers
then
i
would
reccomend
this
d
this
is
a
solid
beer
from
two
bros
nice
complex
taste
profile
with
nice
flavor
and
great
balance
great
garnetbrown
color
with
a
thin
lacing
in
the
glass
fast
dying
head
after
a
couple
sips
the
flavor
is
bit
too
much
maplediacetyl
for
my
taste
at
first
but
im
not
too
familiar
with
this
style
of
beer
very
rich
tasting
spicy
and
buttery
flavors
going
down
with
a
malty
grainbrown
sugar
feeling
in
the
aftertaste
hops
are
noticeable
but
drowned
out
by
the
syrup
on
the
tongue
not
sure
id
rush
out
for
more
of
this
brew
this
is
a
unique
beer
that
i
might
have
to
develop
a
taste
for
compared
to
what
i
usually
drink
abv
is
on
the
high
side
and
the
alcohol
is
up
front
powerful
stuff
good
for
a
slightly
heavier
beer
if
you
like
a
real
punch
and
arent
put
off
by
a
sugary
sweetness
domaine
dupage
is
another
two
brothers
offering
ive
passed
up
for
no
good
reason
this
was
excellent
and
my
wife
no
huge
fan
of
beer
enjoyed
the
heck
out
of
this
at
the
crane
alleys
beer
and
chocolate
pairing
with
me
tonight
i
did
too
excellent
beer
well
paired
with
a
toffeecaramel
truffle
very
well
done
two
brothers
nice
yeasty
and
malt
flavors
with
a
tart
follow
up
i
was
unsure
of
this
on
first
pour
but
its
drinkability
and
balance
has
won
me
over
d
high
marks
here
i
believe
the
balance
between
what
could
be
considered
too
much
sweetness
and
not
enough
hops
suits
me
well
its
easy
to
drink
very
flavorful
and
the
abv
isnt
too
high
to
where
you
couldnt
perhaps
session
with
this
because
this
is
such
a
sweet
brew
i
would
only
drink
one
or
two
of
these
per
session
but
would
definitley
consider
returning
to
for
one
on
a
consistent
basis
fairly
good
12
would
be
the
max
not
really
a
session
beer
due
to
the
sweetness
and
fruity
esters
serving
type
bottle
notes
this
was
my
first
biere
de
garde
and
was
not
at
all
what
i
was
expecting
i
was
assuming
it
would
be
a
lighter
wheat
beer
along
the
lines
of
a
saison
id
say
im
neither
disappointed
nor
pleased
im
mostly
just
intrigued
with
this
specific
beer
and
the
style
ill
probably
try
this
again
at
some
point
and
might
seek
out
another
biere
de
garde
to
compare
even
though
this
beer
didnt
blow
me
away
its
not
something
i
would
get
too
excited
about
in
the
future
but
i
can
appreciate
its
quality
and
can
understand
why
someone
else
might
love
it
how
weird
best
by
121009
never
had
that
happen
before
appears
a
slightly
hazed
amber
hue
with
a
nice
creamy
tawny
off
white
head
leaves
behind
ample
lacing
with
each
sip
fine
scattered
layers
at
that
aroma
has
a
nice
vinous
herbal
flow
to
it
with
a
touch
of
citrus
hops
but
dominant
bread
like
caramel
roasted
malts
are
the
highlight
of
the
nose
flavor
really
hits
with
the
sweetness

with

some
heavy
grainy
wheaties
like
flavors
with
semi
bitter
finish
with
some
citrusand
herbal
hops
carrying
through
in
the
finish
i
get
a
nice
fruity
refreshing
quality
the
whole
time
with
a
dry
yeast
and
mild
spiced
finish
a
really
nice
sessionable
ale
that
packs
massive
layers
of
flavor
mouthfeel
overall
is
smooth
carbonation
is
moderate
and
natural
body
pulls
off
at
least
a
medium
ranking
without
overdoing
any
one
area
very
balanced
drinkability
is
sound
in
all
regards
i
wish
these
guys
would
be
more
readily
available
for
me
this
domaine
dupage
was
like
a
nice
piece
of
crusted
bread
buttered
perfectly
with
herbs
sprinkled
on
top
it
was
simplistic
and
perfect
for
the
experience
its
trying
to
pull
off
poured
golden
copper
into
a
snifter
with
very
little
offwhite
head
and
no
lacing
the
smell
was
a
little
subdued
for
what
ive
grown
accustomed
to
with
this
style
subtle
earthiness
leather
and
some
spices
coriander
and
maltiness
the
taste
was
a
watereddown
version
of
the
smell
with
even
less
coriander
than
before
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
on
the
thin
side
too
this
beer
needs
a
little
work
poured
into
a
chimay
goblet
had
a
nice
copper
color
smells
of
bready
fruity
sweetness
carries
a
malty
yet
balanced
taste
very
easy
to
drink
not
too
familiar
with
the
style
but
it
definitely
could
be
a
nice
session
beer
notes
rather
forgettable
bier
de
garde
in
my
opinion
a
style
that
does
not
inspire
too
much
in
me
easy
drinker
good
for
all
year
round
drinking
the
sweetness
lends
it
as
a
good
drinker
with
savory
dinners
yes
a
nice
one
for
this
style
notes
feels
very
much
like
an
old
beer
style
good
medium
to
heavy
mouthfeel
with
good
carbonation
however
this
doesnt
seem
to
be
the
same
beer
i
remember
from
before
reviewed
on
tap
i
still
have
five
more
to
go
to
figure
it
out
but
three
of
those
are
reserved
for
the
cellar
d
solid
this
is
a
good
beer
that
will
definitely
make
it
into
my
rotation
i
could
drink
several
in
a
sitting
damn
tasty
and
damn
drinkable
goes
down
really
well
i
will
have
this
again
and
know
some
friends
who
will
love
this
as
well
despite
not
being
huge
craft
drinkers
nice
beer
that
is
easily
available
and
nicely
priced
serving
type
bottle
d
smooth
to
drink
goes
down
easy
abv
is
manageable
flavors
are
not
overwhelming
not
filling
dcomfortable
taste
quenches
my
thirst
and
makes
me
thirsty
for
more
d
easily
drinkable
but
im
not
huge
on
the
taste
i
liked
this
beer
although
it
was
a
too
sweet
for
my
usual
tastes
drinkability
very
drinkable
its
like
a
lower
abv
belgian
dubbel
i
will
definitely
order
this
one
on
tap
again
if
its
available
amber
colored
beer
with
a
slowly
fading
head
aroma
is
caramel
malts
and
bread
taste
is
maltycaramel
and
biscuit
smooth
and
refreshing
with
lots
of
flavor
seems
to
be
worthy
of
any
outing
or
occasion
i
would
recommend
and
purchase
again
good
job
by
two
brothers
brewing
kind
of
reminds
me
of
a
cross
between
a
belgian
dubbel
and
a
wee
heavy
delicious
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
beer
as
i
had
no
idea
what
to
expect
unique
and
had
me
coming
back
for
more
im
going
to
look
for
this
at
my
local
store
try
one
subtle
and
interesting
this
is
a
style
that
i
havent
had
the
opportunity
to
encounter
very
often
this
beer
is
very
flavorful
and
balanced
resulting
in
a
great
drinkability
as
a
session
brew
solid
atmosphere
appearance
is
pretty
good
but
unspectacular
and
basic
but
full
nose
really
nice
flavor
great
balance
of
bitter
and
sweet
all
on
a
light
malt
base
overall
this
is
a
really
good
quaff
very
tasty
brew
however
i
couldnt
drink
many
of
these
its
very
mood
and
food
specific
reddish
brown
pour
with
very
minimal
white
head
smells
of
grapes
and
oak
taste
is
malty
and
nutty
almost
like
a
brown
ale
without
the
body
pretty
refreshing
an
aftertaste
similar
to
grape
rinds
medium
body
with
mild
carbonation
drinks
nice
goes
down
good
drinks
great
the
body
is
a
little
thicker
than
id
expect
but
its
smooth
d
very
interesting
overall
i
liked
this
quite
a
bit
never
had
anything
else
quite
like
it
reviewed
on
07312009
on
tap
at
blind
tiger
this
beer
pours
a
deep
red
with
no
head
aroma
of
sweet
malt
very
indistinct
though
flavor
of
sweet
caramel
malt
and
apple
skins
this
is
a
decent
beer
very
drinkable
but
it
is
not
really
complex
at
all
drinkability
really
nice
and
able
to
cut
through
some
of
the
heavier
foods
it
maintains
complexity
through
and
overall
a
great
pick
d
high
this
isnt
a
oneanddone
i
poured
my
french
style
country
ale
into
my
beer
tasting
wine
glass
i
gave
it
a
fairly
vigorous
pour
but
did
not
get
much
head
its
a
slightly
cloudy
amber
nice
color
the
nose
is
malty
a
bit
of
apple
the
taste
is
sweet
malt
with
enough
hop
bite
to
give
it
legs
i
detect
a
bit
of
flowery
flavors
and
dare
i
say
bubble
gumthe
mouth
feel
is
sticky
enough
that
it
may
discourage
you
from
drinking
it
in
the
sun
but
feels
appropriate
for
shoulder
seasons
i
purchase
a
six
pack
of
this
beer
on
occasion
not
a
standby
for
me
but
one
i
will
continue
to
revisit
it
offers
a
nice
counter
point
to
the
stout
and
ipa
that
seem
to
take
residence
in
my
fridge
this
ones
a
pretty
nice
brew
and
was
helpful
in
easing
me
into
an
unfamiliar
style
d
pretty
decent
drinkability
it
is
a
decent
tasting
ale
and
it
is
true
to
the
biere
de
garde
description
i
will
probably
purchase
something
else
from
this
brewery
next
time
i
choose
two
brothers
d
this
is
a
nice
beer
it
goes
down
easily
yet
possesses
a
lot
of
complexities
to
ponder
the
only
detracting
factor
for
me
was
the
out
of
place
citrus
flavors
otherwise
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
it
d
definitely
not
my
favorite
offering
from
two
bros
but
still
a
good
brew
even
with
that
said
i
would
not
hesitate
to
recommend
this
one
d
easy
to
finish
and
something
i
like
to
have
a
bunch
of
from
time
to
time
probably
my
go
to
beer
from
two
brothers
and
the
first
beer
i
ever
tried
form
them
however
i
only
faintly
tasted
molasses
regardless
it
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
mellowing
out
as
i
got
through
it
and
i
must
say
drinking
it
put
me
in
a
better
mood
childhood
memories
i
guess
i
think
i
may
have
another
and
go
sit
out
on
the
back
deck
cheers
drinkability
is
good
very
mellow
and
easygoing
brew
with
fresh
hops
notes
and
a
very
drinkable
profile
cheers
the
aroma
is
light
fruity
apricots
but
thats
about
it
taste
is
a
lot
of
yeasty
and
white
wine
characters
just
weird
confusing
and
not
very
good
d
this
is
a
great
biere
de
garde
and
its
is
very
easy
drinking
overall
this
beer
was
unique
some
good
parts
some
not
so
good
my
bottle
is
going
slow
but
i
dont
mind
it
i
dont
know
how
much
more
id
want
though
this
beer
poured
a
light
cloudy
copper
with
a
huge
head
the
smell
is
mostly
sweet
malt
with
a
bit
of
fruitiness
the
taste
reminds
me
of
a
beer
mixed
with
a
cider
some
sweet
malt
up
front
that
gives
way
to
a
dry
apple
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
pleasant
with
a
certain
dryness
and
plenty
of
carbonation
no
problems
with
drinkability
on
this
beer
id
go
so
far
as
to
say
it
might
be
a
good
starter
beer
for
people
who
dont
know
they
like
beer
yet
one
of
the
joys
of
cougars
games
is
the
two
brothers
taps
right
behind
my
seats
drinkability
in
looking
at
the
guidelines
this
one
meets
the
style
fairly
well
i
am
not
sure
if
i
would
have
another
one
but
i
can
see
this
being
sessionable
for
someone
who
likes
the
style
mouthfeel
really
shines
in
this
one
taste
might
be
on
the
mild
side
but
domain
dupage
remains
a
satisfying
beer
drinkability
great
i
like
this
beer
alot
it
is
certainly
a
sessionable
brew
that
has
a
multitude
of
strengths
worth
seeking
out
drinkability
is
good
and
a
lower
abv
belgian
i
will
be
drinking
more
of
thanks
to
a
friend
for
sharing
a
case
styles
aside
this
is
was
an
interesting
belgian
amber
very
subtle
and
drinkable
theres
a
not
unusual
but
uncommon
smooth
cherry
caramel
taste
that
finishes
with
a
gentle
belgian
spice
no
its
not
a
big
robust
belgian
but
its
certainly
a
decent
session
beer
and
good
rival
to
fat
tire
d
mildly
drinkable
the
unusual
aftertaste
and
sticky
viscous
mouthfeel
invite
guzzling
not
very
drinkable
it
is
decent
enough
as
it
the
first
beer
i
have
had
of
this
style
but
the
sourness
and
over
fizzy
with
no
decent
returns
i
cannot
endorse
this
one
kudos
two
bros
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
my
maredsous
chalice
this
ale
appears
a
mildly
cloudy
light
chestnut
color
with
about
a
finger
of
lively
off
white
foam
aroma
and
flavor
are
of
sweet
malts
white
sugar
nicely
toasted
grains
fruity
apples
and
bread
medium
to
moderate
carbonation
with
a
crisp
dry
finish
nice
and
quenching
tasty
stuff
also
my
first
beer
from
two
brothers
this
is
a
quality
beer
that
i
would
definitely
drink
again
d
ive
been
sitting
on
this
for
a
while
for
some
reason
but
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
with
this
two
brothers
offering
very
interesting
flavorful
style
with
a
pretty
light
crisp
body
and
lots
of
subtle
complexities
all
working
together
to
create
an
extremely
drinkable
beer
despite
that
however
this
beer
is
still
somewhat
drinkable
and
i
suspect
it
works
much
better
on
a
hot
summer
day
md
kind
of
bland
tasting
not
as
flavorful
as
i
was
hoping
for
i
probably
wont
pick
up
another
d
the
rich
malt
character
is
the
defining
characteristic
of
this
beer
nothing
overly
complex
but
that
is
par
for
the
style
the
relative
dryness
of
the
finish
helps
with
drinkability
but
the
malt
could
become
a
bit
cloying
if
this
were
more
than
a
12oz
bottle
a
nice
example
of
an
unusual
style
this
is
going
to
be
a
great
yearround
ale
but
im
looking
forward
to
pairing
it
with
summer
foods
vegetables
and
balsamicmarinated
chicken
on
the
grill
corn
cobs
with
butter
and
salt
the
occasional
burrito
with
sweet
potato
mash
instead
of
rice
overall
i
like
it
and
would
purchase
another
sixer
d
im
surprised
this
is
only
a
6
beer
seemed
to
have
a
bit
more
alcoholic
character
to
it
paired
with
a
burger
or
nice
sandwich
this
was
an
excellent
beer
i
found
it
to
malty
sweet
but
this
may
be
good
on
hot
summer
day
d
not
for
me
other
ales
that
came
in
the
variety
case
were
all
much
better
frankly
im
surprised
that
so
many
actual
french
attempts
at
their
own
indigenous
style
cant
seem
to
match
this
american
versions
superior
balance
of
complexity
and
drinkability
overall
mouthfeel
was
nothing
special
but
well
carbonated
and
enjoyable
very
drinkable
im
no
expert
on
the
style
but
i
found
it
very
drinkable
drinkability
a
very
interesting
beer
that
is
refreshingly
drinkable
really
like
the
balance
d
good
drinkability
certainly
enjoyed
this
beer
and
could
see
easily
pairing
well
with
a
number
of
different
foods
would
purchase
again
and
would
like
to
try
on
tap
i
expected
this
beer
to
be
on
lees
but
it
is
crystal
clear
and
not
overly
yeasty
by
any
means
florida9mar

but
as
time
passed
i
realized
that
it
was
superb
when
judged
by
its
own
merits
an
interesting
venture
from
two
brothers
im
eager
to
see
other
american
brewers
tackle
this
style

was
not
what
i
expected
i
had
mine
while
having
a
superspicy
bowl
of
chili
and
this
beers
taste
and
character
shone
right
through
there
is
a
bountiful
earthy
sweet
aroma
here
slightly
spicy
nice
light
brown
pour
with
an
amber
accent
sizable
head
and
moderate
lacing
pleasant
on
the
palate
could
be
creamier
interesting
flavor
much
different
from
the
aroma
in
many
respects
taste
is
sweet
with
an
initial
hit
of
caramel
followed
by
a
mild
hop
bitterness
there
is
a
bit
of
earthiness
in
the
taste
interesting
brew
definitely
enjoyable
appearance
is
clear
copper
with
ruby
highlights
received
a
disappointing
frat
pour
otherwise
known
as
no
room
left
for
decent
foam
but
it
looks
like
an
offwhite
head
and
it
had
decent
lacing
throughout
aroma
is
very
faint
but
im
in
a
typical
college
bar
so
i
would
be
surprised
if
i
could
smell
anything
beyond
the
stale
beer
ashtray
and
urinal
cake
anyhoo
what
i
could
detect
was
some
sweet
malt
faint
fruity
esters
and
some
flowery
noble
hops
taste
is
bursting
with
some
awesome
toasted
malt
with
a
slightly
fruity
sweetness
of
plum
cherry
and
brown
sugar
those
flowery
noble
hops
have
a
moderate
flavor
and
blend
nicely
with
the
malt
but
leave
only
a
slight
hop
bitterness
on
the
tongue
medium
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
and
finishes
dry
that
makes
for
a
very
refreshing
tasting
experience
an
excellent
example
of
an
amber
style
bier
de
garde
and
absolutely
wonderful
on
tap
struggled
to
put
the
light
brown
head
on
top
that
disappeared
almost
before
i
stopped
pouring
it
pleasant
lightly
spiced
nose
that
is
somewhat
promisinglight
peppery
spice
follows
into
the
taste
a
bit
sweet
and
malty
to
support
the
spice
good
balance
but
not
spectacular
warmed
up
fairly
well
but
didnt
open
up
overall
not
bad
id
try
on
tap
if
i
saw
it
but
probably
not
buy
another
bottle
deasy
to
drink
with
a
pleasant
mouthfeel
quite
malty
with
a
fair
amount
of
sweetness
this
is
a
beer
that
borders
on
good
but
in
the
end
falls
a
little
short
due
to
the
sweetness
and
not
enough
drying
characteristics
i
would
like
a
bit
more
of
a
hop
kick
nice
ill
have
another
well
one
more
after
that
i
need
some
hops
mouthfeel
was
decent
once
the
head
went
down
smooth
on
the
taste
buds
this
beer
was
very
drinkable
and
interesting
but
i
think
i
wanted
more
from
these
taste
the
sediment
tells
me
there
might
have
been
an
issue
with
this
bottle
i
will
retry
and
adjust
if
needed
da
decent
but
not
great
bier
de
garde
still
worth
trying
not
sure
where
that
charcoal
comes
from
but
it
reminds
me
of
fat
tyre
pours
a
pretty
ruby
copper
color
with
a
nice
fluffy
egg
shell
head
that
dissipated
into
a
sparse
cap
the
aroma
is
of
smooth
caramel
malt
honey
and
some
dark
fruit
the
taste
is
a
nice
rich
caramel
malt
brown
bread
honey
a
touch
of
grassy
hops
in
the
end
the
feel
is
moderate
with
some
prickly
carbonation
yet
it
remains
quite
a
smooth
beer
it
is
a
tad
slick
but
the
hop
bitterness
help
counter
balance
that
this
is
a
fine
malty
brew
a
very
nice
caramel
malt
that
is
quite
smooth
definitely
worth
a
purchase
on
tap
at
clark
street
pours
a
medium
amber
with
a
sweet
malt
smell
and
taste
very
lightly
bittered
faintest
hint
of
belgium
yeast
like
influence
to
it
but
not
much
kind
of
drying
in
the
finish
but
still
sweet
flavored
decent
but
unremarkable
compared
to
some
of
their
other
beers
i
thought
a
decent
american
stab
at
the
style
d
goes
down
fairly
easy
im
really
digging
the
taste
on
this
one
its
sweet
upfront
but
the
toastiness
and
slight
hops
on
the
backend
balance
it
out
very
well
crafted
not
a
ton
of
carbonation
in
the
head
but
its
a
beer
thats
meant
to
go
down
smooth
boy
does
it
id
love
to
knock
back
a
couple
more
and
at
this
abv
i
just
might
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
overcarbonated
its
a
drainpour
for
me
pours
dark
copper
with
a
nearly
nonexistant
head
what
did
develope
quickly
disappeared
some
spotty
lacing
left
on
the
glass
it
has
a
nice
toasted
malt
aroma
with
caramel
hints
the
taste
is
likewise
malty
some
fruitiness
is
present
but
there
is
mostly
a
earthy
musty
flavor
seems
a
bit
thin
and
carbonation
seems
just
a
step
up
from
being
flat
i
really
wanted
to
score
this
beer
higher
but
looking
at
the
individual
scores
it
doesnt
do
any
of
them
well
it
has
a
good
flavor
and
low
abv
that
helps
drinkability
but
i
dont
think
there
is
a
need
to
seek
this
beer
out
in
the
future
pours
a
dark
amber
color
absolutely
no
head
none
this
also
means
no
lacing
not
sure
if
this
is
typical
of
the
style
being
my
first
one
but
very
underwhelming
in
appearance
smell
is
super
malty
bready
and
slightly
fruity
the
aroma
on
this
thing
is
near
perfection

the
slightest
amount
of

very
sweet
to
the
tastebuds
mouthfeel
is
light
and
crisp
with
little

the
carbonation
that
does
pop
up
tingles
the

i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
i
thought
i
had
a
dud
by
the
look
of
the
pour
but
it
turned
out
to
be
a
really
nice
offering
pours
a
deep
orange
amber
color
with
less
than
a
finger
foamy
off
white
head
that
fades
fairly
quickly

earthy
some

and
grainy
wheat
notes
adequately
carbonated
the
mouth
feel
is
medium
bodied
and
smooth

taste
of

the

has
a
distint
toast
flavor
on

there
are
some
apple
flavors
in
there
too
enough
hops
to
balance
out
what
could
be
a
too
sweet
brew
medium
to

i
like
this
one
its
not
earth
shattering
but
its
something
a
little
different
and
its
well
done
easy
to
drink
very
refreshing
would
be
nice
on
a
nice
summer
evening
this
style
of
beer
is
not
my
favourite
but
since
it
is
the
only
two
brothers
that
gematos
serves
and
i
should
be
eternally
grateful
for
that
i
have
had
a
lot
of
it
very
nice
warm
chestnut
colour
which
always
sports
a
generous
head
when
served
usually
way
too
cold
in
this
place
malty
caramel
aroma
predominates
pleasant
on
the
palate
slightly
sweet
malt
dominates
very
low
hop

well
worth
a
try
especially
for
appreciators
of
this
frenchbelgian
style
d
this
is
a
extremely
drinkable
beer
very
malty
with
excellent
balance
from
the
hops
very
nice
purchased
a
six
pack
for
last
weekend
poured
into
tulip
glasses
smallish
sized
head
that
faded
rather
quickly
the
color
was
a
dark
red
bordering
on
brown
lots
of
lacing
down
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
taste
was
of
burnt
caramel
as
for
the
body
it
was
on
the
heavy
side
and
certainly
had
some
substance
to
it
this
is
not
a
beer
that
you
can
drink
quickly
its
a
slow
sipper
that
tastes
just
as
good
at
room
temp
after
two
though
i
felt
as
though
i
had
enough
a
nice
beer
to
enjoy
with
food
or
by
itself
overall
it
is
a
good
local
craft
beer
would
be
a
great
beer
for
you
if
you
like
a
balance
of
sweet
caramel
malts
to
go
along
with
a
mild
hop
flavor
the
beer
is
dark
reddish
brown
with
a
thin
head
that
maintains
well
the
aromas
are
on
the
malty
side
some
caramel
just
a
little
hops
herbal
and
maybe
a
touch
of
spice
i
dont
know
which
ones
the
taste
is
sweet
and
malty
earthy
and
worty
in
general
nice
not
my
favorite
style
but
its
good
cant
quite
get
my
finger
on
this
brew
its
good
but
also
not
good
not
great
looking
but
most
of
all
alternating
sips
seem
so
different
this
time
it
tastes
like
cough
syrup
that
time
like
toasty
delicious
its
a
beautiful
spring
day
and
this
was
very
refreshing
id
have
it
again
not
overly
heavy
but
still
has
a
strong
body
a
beer
i
first
had
at
a
leonas
restaurant
here
in
chicago
and
was
impressed
by
its
ability
to
to
hold
its
own
with
italian
food
i
dont
know
what
a
french
country
style
ale
should
be
but
this
is
darn
good
sweet
malty
aroma
includes
a
hint
of
summer
fruits
apple
and
pear
quaff
was
a
tasty
treat
of
well
balanced
fruits
with
a
nice
hop
finish
also
has
a
bit
of
a
tart
bite
drinks
easily
this
would
be
a
nice
summer
brew
in
the
heat
i
may
be
a
little
bit
partial
since
this
is
a
local
brewer
but
i
found
this
beer
very
intriguing
and
complex
considering
its
lightness
well
done
my
brothers
d
easy
on
the
taste
buds
and
easy
on
the
gullet
a
nice
smooth
mellow
ale
with
enough
fruity
complexities
to
keep
it
interesting
great
tasting
beer
follows
style
wish
i
would
have
bought
more
than
one
i
really
like
what
these
two
are
doing
good
for
session
will
drink
again
a
very
tasty
brew
form
two
brothers
amber
in
color
and
hazy
with
almost
no
head
it
is
my
first
biere
de
garde
and
i
first
had
it
sevral
years
ago
unfotunatly
it
didnt
catch
on
but
the
professors
pub
a
new
bar
in
kent
ohio
now
carries
it
and
i
cant
pass
it
up
when
ever
i
stop
in
it
has
a
nutty
aroma
with
a
slight
hint
of
aprcot
the
mouthfeeel
and
body
are
good
not
too
heavy
in
the
end
you
get
a
slight
hop
bite
with
bits
of
citrus
floral
notes
quite
pleasureable

the
beer
pours
amber
with
a
halfinch
white
head
head
retention
and
lacing
are
both
average
the
beer
has
a
sweet
and
slightly
sour
fruity
aroma
it
smells
like
caramel
apple
citrusy
hops
and
vinegar
tastes
like
apple
caramel
lemon
peel
bread
bittering
hops
and
a
bit
of
funk
overall
the
taste
is
a
bit
on
the
weak
side
mouthfeelbody
is
a
bit
creamy
with
moderate
carbonation
drinkability
is
ok
its
smooth
and
not
hard
to
drink
i
dont
recall
having
a
beer
of
this
style
before
so
i
sont
really
have
anything
else
to
compare
it
to
i
cant
say
its
one
of
my
favorites
but
its
not
bad
ill
have
to
try
this
one
again
and
similar
beers
in
the
future
just
to
get
a
better
grasp
of
it
but
yeah
id
try
it
again
pours
a
clear
orange
brown
nose
is
a
strong
leafy
aspect
flavor
is
nice
and
roasted
seems
a
bit
leafy
lasting
profile
feel
is
a
bit
thick
on
the
liquid
and
smooth
on
carbonation
a
nice
example
of
this
style
i
usually
dont
go
for
it
but
i
like
this
one
no
freshness
dating
but
best
if
used

that
dissipated
quickly
into
a
thin
skim
light
consistent
lacing
throughout
the
session
scent
of
hops
reminded
me
a
little
of
mh
9
taste
was
not
what
i
expected
slightly
more
malt
than
hops
but
also
tasted
a
little
skunky
somewhat
lively
mouthfeel
initially
but
carbonation
disappeared
rather
quickly
leaving
somewhat
of
a
flat
mellow
mouthfeel
not
at
all
crisp
not
bad
but
somewhat
middle
of
the
road
all
and
all
a
very
pleasant
beer
d
i
only
drank
half
of
the
beer
it
was
too
strong
and
syrupy
for
me
like
i
said
before
ill
review
again
to
see
if
i
just
got
a
bad
beer
ok
vinegar
taste
not
for
me
assumed
based
on
name
it
was
a
biere

didnt
seem
to
fit
the
style
based
on
others
i
have
had
i
wouldnt
hurry
back
to
this
one
tastes
great
and
very
drinkable

its

a
pretty

im
actually
pretty
impressed
with
this
beer
its
a
first
encounter
with
the
style
and
its
better
than
i
expected
overall
good
beer
this
is
a
fine
offering
i
didnt
notice
the
usual
off
flavors
i
associate
with
french
country
ales
id
equate
it
to
a
very
good
pale
ale
mouthfeel
had
a
creeping
zip
with
tiny
bubbles
of
carbonation
medium
in
body
d
an
outstanding
aroma
and
tasty
flavors
and
a
near
perfect
balance
of
roastiness
and
hoppiness
make
this
an
eminetnly
drinkable
brew
its
flavorful
enough
to
hold
my
interest
and
mellow
enough
to
drink
three
or
four
d
my
first
bier
de
garde
review
so
take
it
with
a
grain
of
salt
very
drinkable
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
alot
going
on
complex
i
would
definitely
drink
this
again
d
the
ale
despite
its
big
malt
body
is
reasonable
alcoholwise
creating
a
big
tasting
drink
that
wont
lay
you
out
beer
poured
a
copperamber
color
with
a
white
head
that
is
well
sustained
and
is
leaving
a
nice
lacing
behind
nose
is
very
pleasant
of
lighter
fruits
and
a
hint
of
floral
hops
taste
has
hints
of
apple
pears
and
finishes
with
a
dry
hop
accentuated
by
the
fruits
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
and
somewhat
smooth
overall
drinkability
is
very
refreshing
and
easy
drinking
recommended
if
you
have
access
to
this
brew
d
decent
beer
nothing
crazy
special
but
drinkable
it
poured
a
dark
reddish
amber
with
a
thin
layer
of
white
foam
that
quickly
dissipated
away
into
a
few
foamy
white
rings
along
the
edge
of
the
beer
and
a
few
white
streaks
of
lace
around
the
glass
it
didnt
have
much
of
an
aroma
to
it
all
there
was
was
a
light
aroma
of
a
few
juicy
fruits
coated
in
brown
sugar
thats
all
i
got
when
it
warmed
up
still
nothing
else
emerged
from
the
background
of
the
smell
it
had
a
light
and
mild
taste
of
toasted
malts
some
juicy
fruits
tame
toasted
citrus
hops
and
then
finished
off
with
a
small
dab
of
sweet
caramel
there
werent
many
tastes
in
the
taste
department
but
what
was
there
made
for
a
better
than
average
taste
i
would
have
to
say
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
light
side
with
a
soft
aftertaste
of
toasted
malts
and
a
few
juicy
fruits
i
wouldnt
mind
trying
it
again
but
if
i
dont
i
wouldnt
be
hart
broken
if
i
missed
it
it
was
an
ok
beer
medium
body
and
very
drinkable
with
a
meal
d
extremely
drinkable
would
be
great
for
a
nice
session
with
six
of
these
and
a
tasty
cheese
platter
overall
one
of
my
favorite
offerings
from
two
brothers
overall
i
really
liked
this
beer
had
a
great
balance
with
some
flavors
thrown
in
that
you
dont
see
everyday
like
an
elephant
walking
a
toy
poodle
i
wish
i
had
some
more
of
this
but
will
look
forward
to
the
day
i
see
a
six
pack
in
the
cooler
hue
is
rich
deep
coppermahogany
minimally
carbonated
bouqet
is
redolent
of
raisins
caramel
dark
stone
fruits
honey
taste
is
semisweet
upfront
just
enough
bittering
from
the
hops
to
provide
balance
on
the
finish
general
taste
is
reminiscent
of
sweet
dark
fruit
mouthful
is
slightly
viscous
in
a
good
way
due
to
the
residual
sugars
this
is
not
necessarily
a
session
beer
but
i
could
stand
a
few
of
these
a
nice
representation
of
the
french
country
ale
style
a
clean
refreshing
well
balanced
ale
sessionable
approachable
and
enough
flavour
and
body
to
hold
the
interest
of
an
experienced
beer
drinker
as
well
as
turn
a
newbie
onto
craft
beer
ill
be
looking
for
this
one
again
come
summer
time
great
fresh
flemish
fantastic
ale
a
decent
beer
for
sure
and
it
would
definitely
go
well
with
a
roasted
turkey
dinner
as
it
is
so
often
recommended
for
thanksgiving
to
have
biere
de
garde
i
rated
this
low
on
drinkability
because
of
the
bitter
finish
this
drinks
like
a
bigger
beer
than
it
is
recommended
but
not
an
everyday
beer
drinkability
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
like
this
class
of
beers
and
with
the
lower
alcohol
level
in
this
one
it
makes
it
more
reasonable
to
have
a
few
pours
a
clear
amber
with
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
that
forms
a
tight
white
head
then
falls
to
a
collar
of
bubbles
the
nose
is
maltaccented
and
yeasty
biscuit
and
light
caramel
malt
flavors
dominate
at
first
then
more
tawny
malt
flavors
express
themselves
along
with
a
bit
of
an
alcoholic
bite
that
suggests
something
stronger
than
5
9
percent
a
tasty
maltaccented
beer
that
i
think
could
finish
a
bit
drier
the
mouthfeel
is
good
and
body
just
about
right
but
the
finish
is
a
little
too
thick
reducing
the
drinkability
a
bit
feels
great
in
my
mouth
although
its
sitting
a
little
on
the
heavy
side
thus
making
this
a
beer
id
have
a
couple
of
but
no
more
totally
recommended
though

foam
was

settled
the
smell
was
lightly
malty
with
a
faint

smell
overall
the
smell
was
fresh
and
crisp
the
taste
was
lightly
malty
with
a
touch
of
caramel
malt
and
a
hint
of
sweetness
there
was
a
spicy
hoppiness
beneath
the
malt
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
with
medium
body
and
good
carbonation
it
was
relatively
clean

with

this

its

slightly
hazy
orangebrown
topped
with
a
meek
simpering
collar
of

despite
the
lack
of
a
prominent
head
theres
sticky
lace
all
over
the
glass
sweetish
and
malty
in
the
nose
a
bit
of
sugary
sweetness
fairly
well
balnced
to
the
sweet
side
with
weaker
floral
hops
smells
kinda
old
with
prevalent
honey
and
the
dulled
hops
although
the
bottle
is
within
code
none
of
the
funky
barn
smell
i
associate
with
biere
de
garde
much
more
like
a
sweeter
saison
pretty
tame
kind
of
an
apple
pie
aroma
with
doughy
muddy
caramel
belgian
malt
and
appley
esters
not
quite
what
id
wanted
but
not
at
all
unpleasant
the
flavor
starts
out
apple
pielike
clean
clover
honey
golden
caramel
and
granny
smith
apple
dominate
the
flavor
sweet
with
a
touch
of
belgian
yeast
spice
a
bit
of
a
floral
spicy
bite
of
hops
in
the
finish
though
very
mild
mostly
driven
by
the
malt
and
yeast
character
i
cant
help
but
feel
this
is
about
6
months
expired
sans
the
surge
of
carbonation
good
but
not
as
impressive
as
others
of
the
style
or
others
from
the
same
brewery
my
weakest
experience
with
two
bros
so
far
sessionable
in
the
way
that
theres
not
a
lot
going
on
and
you
can
keep
sipping
softer
carbnation
aids
in
the
experience
with
a
fullish
body
id
probably
want
just
one
or
two
before
opting
for
something
else
though
after
relating
it
to
apple
pie
thats
pretty
much
the
gist
of
it
let
me
tell
you
theres
a
lot
worse
than
being
compared
to
apple
pie
especially
when
were
talking
about
american
beer
d
very
tasty
easy
to
drink
lovely
mouthfeel
lots
of
malt
and
old
world
beer
character
mouthfeel
drinkability
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
the
beer
has
a
buttery
diacetly
alcohol
very
slick
on
the
mouth
the
bee
is
carbonated
nicely
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
this
is
not
a
must
have
beer
in
my
own
opinion
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
probably
wont
buy
again
drinkability
not
bad
but
this
just
didnt
come
off
as
good
as
some
others
do
in
the
style
worth
a
try
mfd
slick
and
oily
with
a
slight
carbonation
sting
i
would
only
have
a
few
of
these
because
of
the
insane
sweetness
but
this
goes
down
so
easy
quite
the
treat
this
is
one
incredibly
balanced
beer
easy
to
drink
and
tasty
would
make
a
nice
session
beer
drinkability
this
is
very
good
goes
down
well
and
is
very
sessionable
mouthfeel
dry
and
very
lingering
i
get
where
they
are
going
with
this
beer
and
it
succeeds
admirably
too
bad
what
they
were
shooting
for
wasnt
good
taste
appearance
is
a
rich
copper
with
good
initial
head
that
leaves
moderate

smell
is
fruity
with
some
yeasty
undernotes
taste
was
surprisingly
malty
no
real
bitterness
except
for
a
tad
on
the
finish
reminded
me
a
bit
of
a
maibock
mouthfeel
was
slightly
oily
i
was
hoping
for
a
bit
more
dryness
but
not
bad
ok
on
the
drinkability
scale
a
good
brew
just
not
way
above
average
with
such
an
elegant
label
i
expected
a
little
more
we
all
make
mistakes
good
all
around
easy
on
the
senses
but
not
lacking
in
complexity
from
the
bottle
poured
a
amber
with
a
off
white
head
that
left
a
small
amount
of
lacing
aroma
sweet
malt
hops
with
a
nice
touch
of
caramel
fruity
flavor
i
was
excepting
something
close
to
jully
pumpkin
but
this
beer
is
no
where
close
to
jps
beer
that
said
i
enjoyed
this
beer
very
easy
to
drink
nice
and
smooth
got
caramel
hops
and
malts
sweet
good
beer
very
rich
yet
subtle
a
nice
malty
bière
de
garde
much
better
than
the
first
beer
i
had
from
two
brothers
ill
have
to
give
some
more
of
their
beers
a
try
recommended
d
very
drinkable
could
be
a
sessionable
version
of
a
saison
alcohol
hidden
well
verdict
this
isnt
a
beer
that
wows
you
with
big
flavor
the
malt
profile
isnt
especially
complex
but
its
smooth
sweet
and
wellbalanced
it
went
very
nicely
with
a
light
caesar
salad
this
offering
from
two
brothers
pours
a
dark
maroon
that
has
some
yeast
floating
around
the
body
leaving
a
tan
lace
that
floats
on
the
top
of
the
beer
the
aroma
is
plum
dates
figs
prune
lots
of
stone
fruit
are
present
in
this
saison
there
is
a
sweetness
to
the
body
sugary
prune
juice
the
taste
is
hoppy
starts
off
with
watery
plum
fruit
juice
feel
it
has
a
malty
background
that
reminds
me
of
grape
juice
the
finish
is
a
suttle
hop
bitter
aftertaste
with
a
somewhat
floural
watery
mouthfeel
pretty
decent
overall
i
love
the
different
flavor
for
this
saison
medium
copper
body
with
golden
edges
and
a
small
offwhite
head
toasted
grains
on
the
nose
with
light
fruity
sweetness
a
bit
of
spice
in
there
too
grains
of
paradise
not
much
else
toasted
bitterness
up
front
fruity
malt
with
singed
notes
follows
and
mixes
with
light
whiskey
and
wood
flavors
interesting
finish
shows
tangiertarter
sides
of
the
fruit
and
resonant
toasted
slightly
floral
bitterness
medium
to
light
bodied
with
a
slightly
sticky
nicely
carbonated
feel
not
bad
and
the
tartness
mixed
with
caramelbread
is
different
than
any
beer
ive
had
lately
this
is
a
saison
i
guess
brewers
can
do
whatever
they
want
to
a
style
and
im
all
for
experimentation
but
this
beer
doesnt
fit
into
any
category
really
and
its
certainly
not
a
saison
a
bit
of
an
identity
crisis
here
pours
a
dark
stainedwood
amber
kind
of
nice
actually
but
with
no
head
at
all
if
i
had
to
place
a
style
label
on
this
one
id
lump
it
in
as
an
esb
or
english
ales
in
general
full
of
toffee
carmel
and
buttery
notes
with
a
fairly
quiet
hop
profile
decently
malty
but
lost
once
again
definitely
not
a
saison
in
my
book
chewy
mouthfeel
kind
of
slick
well
it
does
have
a
few
redeeming
qualities
but
its
nothing
more
than
a
mild
amber
with
a
saison
label
on
it
who
knows
though
you
might
like
it
two
brothers
do
a
great
job
in
general
this
one
just
needs
a
little
work
id
say
the
mouthfeel
is
interesting
light
and
crisp
almost
like
a
lager
very
hard
to
describe
what
is
happening
as
the
flavors
run
across
my
palate
probably
not
something
i
will
try
again
yet
it
wasnt
so
dull
that
i
have
ruled
out
two
brothers
thin
head
less
than
18
inch
but
with
surprisingly
good
lacing
appears
clear
no
cloudiness
very
light
carbonation
light
reddishcopper
color
sweet
aroma
hints
of
apple
slightly
tart
mouthfeel
but
smooth
due
to
the
lack
of
carbonation
as
for
taste
a
sweet
malty
start
quickly
fades
and
gives
way
to
a
moderate
alcohol
presence
strong
caramel
taste
good
grain
flavor
and
a
faintly
bitter
finish
not
quite
like
the
other
saisons
ive
had
perhaps
its
the
country
ale
twist
but
i
really
like
it
an
impressive
brew
that
could
use
a
bit
more
carbonation
maybe
it
is
just
my
bottle
this
is
a
tasty
beer
even
if
it
is
not
a
classic
saison
in
style
there
is
a
very
nice
graininess
to
it
as
opposed
to
the
spicy
yeasty
flavor
that
typically
is
found
in
a
saison
it
is
a
nice
flaovr
though
and
one
of
the
better
saisons
out
there
it
is
definitely
a
creative
take
on
the
style
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
a
1
tan
head
over
the
cloudy
coppery
amber
brew
head
lasts
nicely
with
plenty
of
bubbly
lacing
aroma
is
grains
and
light
spicing
taste
is
hearty
grains
a
touch
of
sour
and
then
closes
with
a
touch
of
dry
mouthfeel
is
great
smooth
grains
and
tart
working
well
together
and
drinkability
is
excellent
as
well
not
sure
if
its
to
style
but
its
yummy
and
that
works
for
me
drinkability
very
drinkable
not
par
to
style
but
tasty
nonetheless
drinkability
this
is
inoffensive
and
pleasant
possibly
a
good
crossover
beer
saison
hardly
this
just
tastes
like
a
really
malty
amber
ale
its
pretty
good
yeah
and
it
is
certainly
easy
drinking
but
this
is
hardly
what
i
think
of
when
i
think
saisontheres
no
spiciness
or
complex
hop
character
still
well
worth
while
though
from
a
12
oz
bottle
nice
clear
dark
amber
with
a
light
tan
head
mild
smell
of
caramel
and
light
roasted
grains
medium
bodied
with
a
chalky
mouthfeel
decent
taste
of
honey
wheat
bread
finishes
crisp
and
clean
this
would
be
a
decent
mild
session
brew
brave
stuff
from
a
worthwhile
brewery
this
is
an
accomplished
saison
that
could
be
labeled
as
fantome
hivers
baby
brother
it
brings
an
mild
sourness
to
the
caramel
dough
nutty
complexity
that
forms
the
backbone
of
this
hazelnut
amber
brew
buttery
and
musty
with
hints
of
grass
and
hay
parties
in
the
mouth
medium
bodied
with
nice
light
carbonation
no
head
excellent
session
saisonbut
arent
they
all
light
body
medium
fizzy
carbonation
some
tingling
sensation
at
the
finish
that
rounds
it
out
could
be
easily
drinkable
if
there
was
some
incentive
in
the
flavor
dept
its
average
and
balanced
12
ounce
bottle
two
brother
french
style
country
ale
pours
out
a
slightly
cloudy
copper
color
with
an
inch
of

the
aroma
is
spot
on
for
the
biere
de
garde
style
sweet
malt
honey
herbs
and
a
little
tangy
strongly
herbal
flavor
with
orange
coriander
and
other
spices
a
little
bit
of
a
sweet
honey
flavor
i
would
like
if
it
were
a
little
more
sweet
and
malty
and
a
little
less
sour
medium
mouthfeel
good
beer
and
especially
impressive
that
this
is
an
american
version
pours
with

to

ring
leaving
some

1
85
for
a
12oz
bottle
from
julios
liquors
westborough
ma
the
taste
is
along
the
same
lines
starting
with
a
mildly
nutty
sweet
caramel
then
a
bit
of
fresh
biscuits
and
fruit
pears
and
a
semidry
finish
with
just
a
hint
of
hops
bitterness
and
alcohol
warmth
the
taste
can
only
be
appreciated
at
cellar
temperature
or
warmer
toasted
bread
biscuits
with
caramel
and
a
slight
lemon
flavor
slightly
grassy
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
well
carbonated
i
do
not
think
this
beer
is
a
saison
after
a
pumpkin
porter
i
was
really
in
the
mood
for
a
nice
spicy
saison
what
a
disappointment
this
one
turned
out
to
be
flabby
the
flavor
is
complex
yet
again
not
robust
i
get
sweet
caramel
pears
and
lemony
citrus
notes
throughout
the
finish
is
a
little
tangy
and
fruity
quite
enjoyable
the
bottle
says
5
9
but
i
dont
notice
it
the
drinkability
is
high
as
the
beer
is
smooth
and
goes
down
easily
i
had
never
heard
of
this
brewery
when
i
bought
the
bottle
but
this
beer
makes
me
interested
in
finding
others
notes
good
flavor
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
it
appears
like
a
solid
version
of
a
farmhouse
ale
with
little
spicing
but
that
seems
to
lend
it
to
more
a
a
session
style
the
mouthfeel
was
decent
medium
body
with
low
carbonation
it
had
decent
drinkability
but
it
wasnt
anything
that
i
would
want
to
stick
to
personally
this
beer
pours
a
light
hazy
copper
color
with
a
weak
thinnish
head
that
fades
quickly
aroma
is
of
sweet
bread
flavors
and
honey
a
bit
of
acidity
in
the
aroma
as
well
taste
has
more
of
that
honey
sweetness
and
a
nice
base
of
wheat
and
yeast
flavors
cider
notes
come
in
the
form
of
a
tart
counterbalance
to
the
sweetness
still
it
finishes
a
bit
sweet
with
some
residual
sugars
in
the
end
not
bad
definitely
easy
to
finish
but
not
in
the
top
of
its
class
either
beer
is
good
happy
unique
beering
drinkability
is
good
wouldnt
mind
having
more
of
these
at
all
thanks
go
to
gimmehead
for
this
treat
rich
reddish
copper
with
a
small
offwhite
head
and
minimal
lacing
smells
very
malty
and
grassy
also
some
sweet
caramel
and
sugar
with
a
fruity
apple
or
cherry
aroma
very
earthy
taste
is
of
wheat
malts
grassy
lightly
hopped
with
some
sweet
sugary
notes
and
a
very
clean
finish
maybe
a
little
on
the
thin
side
but
as
i
mentioned
the
mouthfeel
is
very
clean
a
very
well
balanced
beer
that
paired
nicely
with
grilled
pork
chops
and
made
for
a
nice
session
highly
recommended
drinkability
this
really
has
a
full
malty
taste
but
the
hops
are
strong
enough
to
support
it
without
being
sickly
sweet
very
pleasant
to
drink
and
seems
to
fit
the
style
guidelines
very
well
not
a
lot
else
happens
with
this
beer
i
like
it
but
its
not
a
real
thinker
by
any
means
dupage
pours
a
deep
brownishred
color
with
a
slight
creamcolored
head
the
aroma
is
an
interesting
intriguing
mix
of
young
underripe
fruit
and
malts
its
something
like
apple
pear
cherryall
rolled
in
malt
extract
the
aroma
isnt
exactly
strong
but
rather
restrained
it
is
very
appealing
however
the
taste
is
a
mix
of
malty
bready
sweetness
with
tartness
fleeting
acidity
medium
body
yeast
flavors
come
out
in
the
taste
as
the
beer
warms
finish
is
fruity
has
a
touch
of
bitterness
and
is
very
refreshing
i
didnt
have
any
expectations
and
this
was
a
nice
find
a
very
nice
beer
though
i
really
favor
acidic
beers
so
this
might
not
be
for
everyone
i
think
it
has
an
interesting
complex
blend
of
flavors
i
wish
i
hadnt
bought
a
sixer
of
this
crap
bought
this
one
on
a
whim
because
it
looked
good
and
is
brewed
in
the
il
suburbs
where
i
grew
up
pours
from
the
bottle
an
opaque
amber
color
with
hints
of
red
no
real
head
to
speak
of
on
my
pour
at
least
the
smell
is
malty
with
some
caramel
and
dare
i
say
vinegar
tones
coming
through
i
can
also
detect
a
hint
of
hops
but
it
is
definetly
not
upfront
in
any
way
quite
a
unique
smell
this
being
my
first
tasting
of
the
biere
de
garde
style
the
first
sip
is
interesting
almost
has
a
sour
aspect
to
it
hints
of
caramel
and
grapeplum
come
through
along
with
a
slight
hint
of
vinegar
on
the
back
palate
i
can
taste
some
hops
which
helps
bring
this
together
nicely
its
a
little
much
for
me
personally
the
mouthfeel
is
very
light
and
airy
with
a
decent
amount
of
carbonation
as
far
as
drinkability
i
dont
think
id
have
too
many
of
these
in
one
sitting
but
i
may
come
back
to
it
again
because
its
so
different
from
everything
else
i
have
tried
overall
its
a
nice
brew
and
i
look
forward
to
exploring
more
of
what
two
brothers
has
to
offer
this
beer
is
good
in
bottles
and
better
on
tap
my
favorite
beer
from
this
neat
little
brewery
i
have
no
idea
if
this
is
what
a
biere
de
garde
is
supposed
to
taste
like
or
whether
this
is
a
good
representation
of
the
style
all
i
know
is
that
domaine
dupage
is
a
wonderful
beer
that
does
just
about
everything
right
the
sad
part
is
that
this
bottle
is
all
i
have
and
i
cant
remember
where
i
bought
it
well
worth
your
hardearned
money
two
brothers
domaine
dupage
delivers
a
slightly
hazy
deep
amber
body
with
a
reddish
cast
beneath
a
short
but
creamy
head
of
white
foam
that
holds
quite
well
and
leaves
some
thin
lace
about
the
glass
the
nose
is
offers
a
comination
of
delicately
toasty
and
strawlike
grain
with
subtle
notes
of
caramel
alongside
some
soft
summer
fruit
apple
peach
cherry
and
musty
yeast
its
quite
intriguing
the
body
is
mediumlight
with
a
zesty
veryfine
bubbled
natural
carbonation
that
finely
pricks
the
tongue
the
flavor
starts
with
bold
toasty
and
caramelish
malts
upfront
followed
by
a
splash
of
tart
fruit
sour
cherry
tangerine
plum
that
fades
into
the
finish
the
tartnes
is
quite
nice
and
refreshing
and
it
slowly
fades
in
the
finish
giving
rise
to
some
lingering
toasty
malt
a
delicate
spiciness
and
finally
a
drying
chalkiness
that
brings
you
full
circle
and
ready
for
another
sip
given
a
chance
this
is
an
exciting
fairly
complex
refreshing
and
satisfying
beer
that
probably
deserves
much
more
recognition
than
it
receives
very
nicely
done
and
certainly
worth
trying
dynamic
and
molded
in
its
flavor
profile
the
malts
are
toasted
throughout
and
at
some
points
develop
notes
of
butter
caramel
and
toffee
the
hops
are
herbal
and
grassy
the
malts
are
more
scrumptious
as
it
warms
cheers
beertracker
crisp

allaround
this
beer
is

the
aroma
is
mildly

the
flavor
is

but
overall
a
mild
blend
of
malt

hops
and
caramel
the
finish
is
very
smooth
making
for
a
fairly
good
session
beer
overall
i
would
get
this
again
but
its
a

simple
in
places
slightly
murky

herbalfloral
hops

and
a
bit
of

the
taste
is
very
earthy
herbal
malty
and
very
heavy
on
the
caramel
this
is
reminiscent
of
some
french
biere
de
garde
style
ales
but
to
me
this
does
not
have
the
malt
complexities
or
spicy
hop
profile
that
most
french
ales
of
this
nature
have
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
smooth
and
the
drinkability
is
good
this
is
a
very
good
beer
from
the
two
brothers
but
im
not
so
sure
about
this
being
labelled
as
a
biere

the
body
is
a
deep
red
amber
this
is
a
gorgeous
hue
the
head
is

the
aroma
is

with
the
caramel

character
finishes
minerally
and
slightly
chalky
with
citrus
rind
hints
fading
a
unique
albeit
somewhat
rough
brew
that
would
be
an
interesting
one
to
cellar
for
a
few
months
if
i
had
done
this
differently
i
wouldve
brought
it
out
ice
cold
opened
the
bottle
waited
1520
min
then
poured
and
enjoyed
it
nevertheless
its
a
tasty
creation
drinkability
is
very
high
nice
beer
not
sure
if
its
true
to
style
or
not
due
to
limited
experience
with
this
style
but
very
tasty
and
best
offering
ive
had
from
this
brewery
light
amber
hue
no
head
little
movement
from
this
bad
boy
the
nose
reports
plums
fresh
apples
toast
malts
perhaps
the
list
could
go
on
razor
sharp
and
aggressive
offerings
up
front
large
toasted
malts
caramel
some
hops
also
detected
in
the
initial
tasting
becomes
rather
creamy
and
inviting
doughlike
fresh
bread
flavorings
quite
enjoyable
and
for
no
extra
charge
has
a
decent
bellywarmingoffering
nutty
buttery
slick
on
the
edge
of
full
bodied
a
fine
offering
from
the
you
never
know
what
to
expect
from
ebel
bros
had
this
on
cask
at
the
clark
street
ale
house
wow
very
refreshing
not
a
ton
of
hops
in
here
they
let
the
yeast
do
the
talking
for
them
this
is
a
very
tasty
refreshing
beer
my
first
french
country
ale
and
ill
be
sure
to
seek
out
more
of
them
pours
a
nice
orangeyellow
color
good
head
retention
and
moderate
lacing
again
the
aroma
and
the
flavor
comes
from
the
yeast
this
beer
definately
makes
me
want
to
come
back
for
more
this
is
basically
a
supped
up
version
of
a
fat
tire
it
has
more
flavor
character
but
it
is
basically
an
easy
drinking
simple
beer
it
has
some
spicy
notes
which
add
to
the
complexity
but
overall
it
is
quite
simplistic
and
easily
quaffed
a
light
amber
color
with
almost
no
head
when
served
from
the
tap
this
beer
is
mostly
malty
with
some
bready
notes
and
some
belgian
yeast
type
spicing
a
good
intro
beer
for
those
not
yet
in
to
belgian
french
country
beers
ng
deep
orange
with
thick
white
fluffy
head
flowery
aromas
clover
and
spicy
yeast
show
on
the
nose
sweet
medium
bodied
beer
with
a
candy
sugar
sweetness
but
overall
bland
flavors
with
a
lightly
spicy
yeasty
finish
and
a
touch
of
malt
not
enough
happening
could
use
a
bigger
malt
jolt
to
round
things
out
a
nice
looking
brew
but
could
use
some
work
after
examining
the
overall
taste
and
brooding
on
the
finish
it
becomes
apparent
that
this
beers
main
problem
is
one
of
balance
normally
the
hops
wouldnt
show
through
so
much
in
a
french
ale
but
this
one
is
so
thin
onedimensional
and
uninteresting
up
front
that
the
hops
in
the
finish
end
up
overbalancing
the
whole
affair
also
certain
elements
that
should
be
invogorating
somehow
manage
to
fall
flat
the
carbonation
doesnt
feel
very
interesting
or
lively
its
there
but
it
somehow
feels
dead
during
the
finish
the
woody
tannins
languish
on
my
tongue
in
a
rather
uninspiring
way
i
wont
be
bothering
with
any
more
of
this
pours
a
deep
copper
kind
of
odd
for
a
saison
with
a
whispy
halo
of
white
aroma
is
a
mixture
of
bread
dough
slight
caramel
notes
and
grassy
hops
flavor
begins
sweet
and
juicy
with
caramel
and
malt
notes
followed
by
a
nice
balancing
bitterness
i
would
have
expected
it
to
be
a
little
more
dry
but
it
seems
to
work
leaves
a
grassy
aftertaste
that
is
quite
pleasant
mouthfeel
is
lively
with
a
light
to
medium
body
and
medium
carbonation
this
is
a
quite
enjoyable
beer
although
its
not
completely
what
i
thought
it
would
be
probably
my
favorite
from
these
guys
pours
a
very
clean
looking

a

the

is
very

as
everyone
else
has
pointed
out
a
slight

hint
in
the
taste
not
much

more
of
a

overall
an
excellent
brew
that
goes
down
very
smoothly
its
nice
to
promote
a
local
brewer
and
when
they
are
this
good
its
easy
to
do

toasted

at

ive
had
mixed
luck
with
this
beer
some
are
quite
good
and
others
seem
to
have
gone
off
it
varies
bottle
to
bottle
but
in
the
12
i
had
2
were
yeasty
and
poor
hazy
amber
body
with
a
quickly
thining
tan
head
very
little
lacing
deposited
on
the
glass
the
nose
is
fruity
and
light
the
taste
seems
coarse
and
yeasty
a
little
grassy
not
all
that
pleasant
to
my
palate
lots
of
caramel
malt
sense
as
the
beer
warms
to
room
temperature
this
beer
has
a
medium
body
and
slightly
astringent
feel
strong
aftertaste
is
not
particularly
pleasant
good
and
refreshing
overall
excellent
with
a
meal
or
as
a
thirst
quencher
its
a
darker
shade
of
amber
with
a
small
but
thick
offwhite
head
i
cant
get
much
of
an
aroma
out
of
it
just
some
caramel
maltiness
but
the
flavor
is
much
better
than
the
aroma
suggests
notes
of
sweet
caramel
malts
and
toffee
come
through
wonderfully
its
medium
bodied
and
crisp
while
being
rather
chewy
sweet
some
hops
are
in
the
background
through
the
malty
finish
this
is
a
brew
definitely
deserving
of
a
try
thanks

left
with

shortly
after

the
aroma
is
of
roasted
barley
with

hint
of
sweetness
and
a
slightly
earthy
undertone
the
taste
has
a
slight
graininess
to
it
with
a
honey
sweetness
caramel
malts

balance
things
out
a
very
smooth
drinker
with
a
light

but
they
are

finish
im
glad
i
tried
it
but
not
a
beer
style
i
would
seek
out
again
the
beer
pours
a
clear
deep
amber
with
a
somewhat
truncated
head
that
splits
off
into
islands
of
thin
bubbly
froth
something
weird
but
nice
in
the
aroma
like
rosemary
or
sage
or
something
i
think
its
rosemary
i
had
a
farmhouse
ale
that
used
rosemary
at
pizzaport
in
solona
beach
ca
and
this
seems
similar
to
that
this
beer
is
a
real
refreshing
change
from
all
of
the
typical
beer
styles
it
is
very
nice
not
often
do
you
find
french
style
country
ales
available
at
the
local
package
store
thus
im
having
a
hard
time
describing
the
taste
i
would
say
it
has
quite
a
unique
herbal
quality
a
healthy
dose
of
grainy
notes
and
a
nice
bitter
hop
finish
easy
drinking
for
5
9
av
damn
good
beer
overall
not
sure
exactly
what
the
brewer
was
going
for
here
but
as
others
said
it
really
doesnt
fit
the
classic
biere
de
garde
profile
still
it
is
not
a
bad
beer
it
is
just
that
the
sweetness
cuts
the
drinkability
rendezvous
pours
a
bright
reddish
color
with
a
small
lacing
head
there
is
a
oaky
and
sweet
aroma
with
wine
like
notes
the
taste
is
the
same
a
nice
wine
like
oak
flavor
sweeter
overall
very
nice
body
great
carbonation
love
the
feel
and
stronger
flavor
overall
its
a
nice
beer
some
nice
flavors
a
little
too
sweet
this
is
not
a
biere

not
even
close
imagine
a

it

this

no

d
g
ive
had
before
overall
this
is
okay
but
i
dont
think
its
in
its
prime
to
begin
with
and
im
not
convinced
it
really
has
the
chops
to
be
good
even
when
fresh
still
its
nice
to
have
tried
it
at
least
a
decent
interpretation
of
a
style
that
has
a
relatively
wide
range
of
interpretations
it
paired
well
with
the
veal
meatloaf
i
had
ordered
mouthfeel
has
a
medium
body
with
high
carbonation
and
a
dry
finish
o
i
like
a
good
malty
belgian
ale
but
this
one
lacks
the
complexity
to
keep
the
sweetness
below
the
cloying
level
im
not
that
familiar
with
the
style
but
from
what
i
understand
this
was
a
good
representation
kept
me
interested
grew
on
me
as
it
warmed
overall
eh
its
alright
tastes
kind
of
forced
kind
of
thin
i
gave
it
all
4s
because
its
not
a
bad
drink
but
its
not
my
preference
i
feel
the
higher
alcohol
is
forced
and
is
what
gives
it
the
twang
and
its
definitely
not
as
crafty
as
some
of
the
other
breweries
ive
had
it
seems
to
be
special
or
different
only
in
that
its
a
different
style
but
nothing
here
is
adventurous
overall
a
pretty
decent
beer
i
like
mxing
it
up
with
some
of
the
more
unusual
styles
like
biere
de
garde
this
one
worked
pretty
well
with
my
wifes
goulash
medium
bodied
with
a
bitter
earthy
hop
bite
that
lingers
over
the
sweet
malt
backbone
and
funky
farmhouse
yeast
into
a
very
dry
finish
very
dry
and
resinous
with
sticky
pine
needle
grass
and
spicy
spruce
tip
flavor
dominating
the
palate
underneath
there
is
a
decent
malt
backbone
with
hints
of
bread
toffee
caramel
and
biscuit
but
these
notes
are
overwhelmed
by
the
aggressive
hop
presence
the
farmhouse
character
from
the
aroma
is
very
faint
and
barely
noticeable
with
everything
else
going
on
there
is
some
light
fruit
sweetness
toward
the
finish
but
it
still
feels
like
its
lacking
in
balance
because
of
the
earthy
bitterness
a
cloudy
orange
pour
with
a
tall
white
head
opens
with
a
light
fruitiness
on
the
nose
quite
a
bit
of
bread
with
a
touch
of
caramel
butterscotch
and
cardboard
moderate
yeast
aroma
maybe
a
little
fruit
the
flavor
is
fairly
sweet
and
malty
as
well
lots
of
bread
caramel
and
toffee
with
some
of
the
same
cardboard
notes
that
were
present
on
the
nose
not
really
a
fan
of
this
one
o
id
imagine
it
would
be
pretty
hard
to
nail
down
the
terroir
characteristics
of
musty
and
woodsy
when
youre
not
brewing
in
an
actual
farmhouse
for
a
commercial
american
version
lakefront
does
a
good
job
of
capturing
the
complex
malt
sweetness
underlined
by
simple
and
subtle
yeast
components
unless
youve
got
a
major
sweet
tooth
make
this
a
table
beer
and
share
it
with
a
few
people
enjoying
it
with

after
beers
of
this
style
o
ultimately
this
just
doesnt
come

for
me
its
too
sweet
and
out
of
balance
and
theres
some
offflavors
that
i
dont
think
should
be
there
o
this
is
an
odd
beer
with
lots
of
strange
flavor
that
i
wont
say
are
particular
tasty
the
malt
and
fruity
esters
come
through
very
softly
but
the
dms
and
oxidation
just
get
in
the
way
of
everything
it
was
not
offensive
enough
to
drain
pour
and
i
kept
drinking
it
hoping
something
else
would
pop
out
of
the
bottle
o
pretty
interesting
beer
and
my
first
experience
with
the
style
at
4
50
for
a
bomber
i
would
definitely
buy
again
nearly
opaque
amber
color
from
the
haze
lacing
is
not
a
problem
as
the
glasses
have
found
a
new
sticky
friend
aromatic
with
baked
apples
faintness
of
raisins
soft
herbal
tone
and
a
ghostlike
broth
maltiness
is
dialed
up
quite
high
on
the
sweetness
hint
of
metallic
crystallized
sugar
mild
phenol
funk
from
the
yeast
and
some
hop
flavor
hops
do
little
to
help
balance
this
brew
out
estery
with
ripe
fruit
and
warmth
a
lot
thicker
and
sweeter
than
anticipated
but
not
too
far
off
whats
expected
a
decent
stab
at
the
style
poured
into
a
pint
glass
this
brew
has
a
very
hazy
orange
color
with
a
thin
white
head
leaving
a
slight
cap
once
settled
the
aroma
is
strong
of
clove
and
other
warm
spices
the
taste
is
smooth
with
a
good
malt
start
with
the
winter
spices
all
coming
in
the
finish
dry
fruits
such
as
raisin
and
plum
mix
with
the
caramel
and
sweet
malts
could
use
a
little
more
hop
presence
to
balance
things
out
nice
medium
body
that
is
smooth
and
very
rich
decent
carbonation
as
well
this
was
a
nice
brew
to
sit
and
drink
slowly
worth
a
try
on
the
bomber
d
i
am
very
please
goes
into
the
top
10
of
my
all
time
list
would
actively
seek
out
again
nice
work
lakefront
overall
and
ok
beer
i
enjoy
this
beer
but
i
probably
wont
buy
it
again
overall
im
going
to
grade
this
above
the
flavor
because
i
think
this
is
a
versatile
beer
the
spicing
is
a
bit
weird
for
my
taste
but
i
like
the
gusto
with
which
this
beer
goes
for
any
crazy
flavor
it
can
get
overall
with
so
many
great
beers
its
not
easy
to
grade
one
like
this
good
not
great
a
few
years
ago
this
would
have
been
a
standout
another
good
beer
on
tap
at
the
brewery
hits
the
style
as
spicy
cloudy
golden
body
and
creamy
good
drinkability
mildly
toasted
malt
above
average
mouthfeel
balsami
vinegar
in
the
aroma
worth
a
try
alcohol
well
hidden
but
does
it
have
to
be
this
high
lght
tolarable
acidity
overall
it
is
not
a
bad
beer
different
then
what
i
thought
it
would
taste
like
good
beer
wish
i
would
get
it
fresher
the
effect
is
rather
flat
seems
to
want
the
bitterness
or
the
perky
tartness
of
a
good
saison
flowers
and
a
bit
of
perfume
pleasant
on
the
palate
with
a
nice
creamy
carbonation
aftertaste
is
more
like
an
old
ale
getting
ready
for
the
fireside
overall
so
so
beer
here
very
fruity
and
sweet
overall
so
splitting
this
bomber
is
best
drinkability
is
pretty
good
this
is
a
satisfying
bdg
a
bit
exaggerated
with
the
sweetness
but
close
enough
i
dig
it
very
nice
worth
trying
i
passed
on
this
one
yesterday
at
logan
liquors
and
decided
today
that
i
had
to
go
back
and
pick
one
up
poured
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
big
dense
light
tan
head
aromas
of
raisins
white
grapes
and
yeast
on
the
palate
this
one
was
light
to
medium
bodied
with
flavors
of
green
apples
white
grapes
and
yeast
not
a
classical
biere
de
garde
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
but
still
a
very
pleasant
beer
o
a
good
solid
enjoyable
beer
it
just
lacks
that
little
extra
to
make
it
memorable
o
a
tasty
beer
interesting
combination
of
flavors
that
is
quite
pleasant
another
nice
beer
from
lakefront
i
dont
know
what
im
missing
here
but
maybe
its
just
not
my
style
of
beer
smooth
going
down
feels
nice
in
my
mouth
but
the
taste
is
annoying
i
used
water
to
cleanse
my
palate
before
i
tried
it
i
didnt
know
i
would
have
to
cleanse
it
again
to
get
the
taste
out
overall
passable
as
a
bière
de
garde
but
makes
for
a
solid
springtime
refresher
overall
a
good
example
of
the
style
taste
exactly
as
one
would
expect
but
nothing
to
special
or
overly
advance
still
i
would
reccomend
to
anyone
as
an
introduction
to
what
makes
this
style
unique
d
overall
a
decent
example
malty
body
and
feel
fruity
with
a
fair
rate
of
consumption
overall
an
okay
beer
but
a
biere
de
garde
fail
d
this
is
a
beer
that
gets
way
better
as
it
warms
i
know
this
is
true
of
most
beers
but
this
beer
seems
to
be
a
great
example
of
that
the
flavor
just
seems
to
multiply
as
it
warms
not
a
bad
brew
and
very
drinkable
that
being
said
its
probably
not
the
best
example
of
the
style
a
good
brew
though
d
i
guess
there
was
nothing
stand
out
about
this
beer
but
nothing
absolutely
nothing
was
wrong
with
it
easy
going
could
be
an
intro
to
more
funky
belgian
beers
overall
i
like
it
its
a
beer
that
reminds
me
of
spring
golden
color
sweet
fruity
flavors
this
is
quite
nice
i
had
this
beer
with
seafood
scallops
to
be
precise
and
im
not
sure
that
was
the
best
match
however
since
i
have
the
palate
of
a
neanderthal
i
didnt
really
mind
that
much
the
label
advertises
the
finish
as
refreshing
i
found
it
had
a
little
roughness
from
the
esters
and
a
lot
of
length
once
again
especially
as
it
warmed
not
particularly
refreshing
though
probably
wouldnt
buy
this
again
taste
bitter
hops
grape
skin
and
yeast
theres
something
about
this
beer
i
dont
care
for
im
not
sure
if
its
the
particular
hops
or
yeast
strain
or
perhaps
a
combination
of
the
two
another
good
one
form
lakefront
d
nice
and
tasty
once
it
warmed
up
it
became
a
tasty
beer
midway
between
a
quaffer
and
a
sipper
something
nice
to
enjoy
while
catching
up
on
tv
drinkable
just
not
what
it
claims
poured
a
deep
amber
slightly
cloudy
color
into
a
pint
glass
with
no
head
the
aroma
was
a
faint
sweetsour
spicy
mix
reminiscent
of
a
hefeweizen
the
initial
taste
was
even
more
of
the
classic
bananaclove
flavor
of
a
hefeweizen
with
the
exception
of
a
more
harsh
and
bitter
finish
a
slilghtly
fizzy
mouthfeel
but
still
a
very
drinkable
brew
an
interesting
style
a
hoppier
pumpedup
wheat
beer
with
a
surprisingly
smooth
finish
i
liked
it
d
very
drinkable
for
the
style
not
a
great
everyday
beer
however
pours
an
opaque
amber
with
two
fingers
thick
dense
white
head
a
few
rings
of
lace
on
the
glass

upfront
its
grassy
spicy
with
some
mineral
note
mildly
grainy
with
grape
and
light
stone
fruit
sweetness
sugar

nectarine
slightly
tart
lemon
note
grassy
snappy
grain
doughy
and

backing
lightmedium
and

for
a
split
second
then
some
heftier
carbonation
kicks
in
pulling
it
to
mediumplus
with
a
fluffy
feel
finishes
dry
and
fairly
hoppy
delicious
crooshable
a
smooth
refreshing
beer
a
unique
version
of
the
style
bringing
thoughts
of
springtime
and
the
daffodils
for
which
its
named
rare
beer
club
beer
this
is
another
one
of
those
beers
that
make
me
happy
to
be
i
the
club
i
never
would
have
picked
this
up
off
the
shelf
in
a
store
this
a
a
really
nice
beer
doesnt
smell
like
much
but
it
really
comes
through
on
flavor
perfect
summer
beer
crisp
but
flavorful
beer
is
mediumbodied
with
carbonation
of
high
intensity
resulting
in
a
mouthfeel
that
is
fizzy
and
spritzy
appropriate
for
the
bright
flavors
of
the
beer
but
perhaps
a
bit
too
much
so
as
well
even
with
time
the
fizziness
does
not
fully
fade
closes
dry
with
substantial
stickiness
lingering
on
the
palate
and
lips
a
totally
distinctive
brew
that
should
be
tried
just
for
the
education
from
the
750
ml
belgianstyle
bottle
purchased
at
bottleworks
in
san
diego
for
14
bucks
o
a
nice
biere
de
garde
i
wish
the
flavor
was
a
bit
brighter
with
as
much
complexity
as
the
aroma
o
a
beautifully
elegant
hotweather
beer
easily
the
best
nonbrett
biere
de
garde
ive
had
my
third
bottle
in
a
month
and
certainly
wont
be
the
last
highly
recommended
drinkability
a
nice
beer
in
the
french
style
bière
de
garde
ok
head
remains
carbonation
is
still
active
aromas
include
baked
bread
flowery
perfume
lavender
citrus
flavors
include
field
herbs
tea
honey
lemon
zest
as
a
farmhouse
ale
i
find
this
very
tasty
refreshing
and
satisfying
im
torn
on
how
high
to
rate
this
as
i
find
few
flaws
except
perhaps
a
slight
soapy
water
note
or
some
odd
herbs
an
a
tiny
mouth
puckering
drybitter
finish
full
bodied
with
sweet
amber
malts
light
herbs
honeydew
melon
juice
powdered
sugar
its
complex
and
pleasant
reminds
me
a
bit
of
the
achel
yeast
the
field
workers
of
yore
would
have
been
fortunate
to
have
such
a
brew
oa
really
solid
if
unremarkable
beer
the
smell
and
flavors
do
not
hit
you
over
the
head
but
i
dont
think
that
is
what
this
beer
was
trying
to
do
high
marks
for
a
wellbalanced
mouthfeel
too
o
this
is
a
good
beer
it
would
be
great
on
a
hot
day
today
is
not
a
hot
day
the
tartness
took
me
a
minute
to
get
accustomed
to
but
i
was
really
digging
it
towards
the
end
of
the
bottle
this
was
a
tasty
find
jd
o
a
very
subtle
wellcrafted
and
easydrinking
french
blonde
pours
a
hazy
deep
golden
yellow
with
a
thin
tight
small
bubbled
head
nose
is
pretty
nice
light
barnyard
yeast
notes
lemony
and
airy
with
a
faint
spice
to
it
taste
is
similar
a
bit
brighter
with
more
barnyard
nice
balance
of
yeast
more
peppery
mid
to
back
palate
assertive
carb
semi
dry
finish
light
and
refreshing
gets
a
touch
sweet
and
syrupy
towards
the
finish
overall
carbonation
lightens
flavor
easy
to
drink
no
hint
of
abv
beer
is
light
in
body
sweet
and
a
little
floral
it
is
interesting
a
simple
but
completely
decent
biere
de
garde
i
really
enjoyed
it
and
id
even
have
it
again
perhaps
overall
this
is
quite
delicate
but
very
nice
the
floral
character
is
really
well
done
this
is
something
i
look
forward
to
having
again
a
nice
beer
but
really
nothing
worth
any
trouble
i
find
that
this
garde
has
more
in
common
with
a
saison
than
with
a
tradional
biere
de
garde
i
have
to
agree
with
the
person
who
mentioned
this
before
this
is
a
really
nice
drink
and
would
be
nice
with
most
food
profiles
while
pleasant
and
most
drinkable
on
its
own
a
perfect
example
of
what
french
farmhouse
ales
have
to
offer
not
as
malty
as
other
biere
de
gardes
more
like
a
belgian
saison
would
pair
well
with
a
wide
range
of
foods
we
enjoyed
ours
with
tamales
drank
this
on
the
porch
in
the
late
afternoon
of
what
might
be
our
last
proper
summer
day
and
it
was
just
the
thing
fluffy
white
head
leaving
loose
lacing
aromas
of
hay
lavender
and
lemon
zest
nice
maltdriven
body
but
with
a
light
touch
complex
but
not
heavy
handed
and
with
an
easy
drinking
nature
relative
to
its
alcohol
content
thanks
to
ken
for
sharing
this
one
at
a
recent
tasting
poured
a
hazy
yellow
with
a
lingering
ring
of
white
foam
aromas
of
bread
lemons
yeast
and
flowers
on
the
palate
this
one
was
light
bodied
tart
and
prickly
with
flavors
of
straw
vanilla
yeast
lemons
and
light
floral
notes
with
a
smooth
dry
citrus
finish
got
this
beer
through
michael
jacksons
rare
beer
club
poured
into
a
red
wine
glass
with
a
nice
even
white
head
i
could
have
stuck
my
nose
in
it
all
night
lemons
and
pear
was
a
perfect
summer
beer
for
dinner
on
the
porch
served
with
gazpacho
and
grilled
pears
with
balsamic
vinegar
great
beer
glad
i
picked
this
one
up
d
would
love
to
drink
acouple
of
these
throughout
the
night
quite
easy
to
drink
and
satisfying
for
a
farmhouse
ale
upon
removing
the
wire
bail
the
cap
had
a
millimeter
deep
impression
fortunately
the
cork
was
removed
with
no
effort
and
before
anyone
got
hurt
pours
a
hazy
golden
yellow
color
with
a
three
finger
plume
of
soapy
white
head
expected
a
lot
more
good
retention
scent
was
fantastic
combining
light
watery
fruits
flowers
tangy
grain
bready
yeasts
peppery
spice
and
and
wonderful
earthy
funk
with
light
notes
of
barnyard
the
taste
presented
all
components
of
scent
and
was
much
smoother
then
the
scent
dictated
but
still
tremendous
lightly
dry
and
bubbly
on
the
tongue
one
of
the
more
lighter
and
delicate
beers
in
the
style
i
have
sampled
but
full
of
complexity
and
character
o
the
beer
is
quite
easy
to
drink
because
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
from
the
taste
its
an
interesting
take
on
the
style
easy
to
drink
and
quenches
the
thirst
nice
brew
this
beer
is
great
a
biere
de
garde
similar
to
saison
in
style
this
one
is
7
abv
which
gives
it
a
nice
body
and
a
slightly
darker
color
than
most
saisons
very
refreshing
clean
and
interesting
lots
of
grain
husks
and
grassiness
with
fruity
yeast
aroma
pears
apple
wet
hay
a
faint
malty
sweetness
is
balanced
out
with
a
crisp
finish
with
lots
of
impressions
of
freshly
bailed
hay
mmmm
springtime
in
a
bottle
dr
its
very
drinkable
relatively
high
abv
decently
priced
and
of
enjoyable
quality
its
not
special
but
its
worth
a
go
give
her
a
spin
lads
o
overall
this
is
really
quite
nice
not
super
complex
not
super
strong
just
nice
clean
and
refreshing
the
fruit
flavors
meld
together
wonderfully
and
its
a
pleasure
to
smell
and
taste
this
is
the
first
time
ive
tried
this
style
and
i
like
it
its
kinda
like
a
bigger
saison
i
suppose
had
again
on
92613
with
the
same
results
as
above
perhaps
the
only
difference
was
the
less
assertive
pop
this
time
round
drinkability
very
very
drinkable
perfect
for
a
hot
summer
day
obviously
one
needs
to
keep
an
eye
on
the
abv
but
with
a
little
selfrestraint
this
could
be
a
great
beer
for
a
hot
afternoon
in
the
backyard
golden
straw
pour
with
a
champagne
like
head
the
nose
is
lemon
bread
yeast
and
a
little
bit
of
spice
like
pepper
the
taste
is
very
refreshing
lemony
spicy
bready
a
bit
of
fruit
pear
the
flavors
meld
nicely
and
then
dry
off
of
the
palette
in
the
finish
no
hint
of
7
abv
at
all
goes
down
light
and
easy
with
a
big
spritz
of
carbonation
and
a
light
body
this
is
a
really
enjoyable
beer
would
make
a
perfect
6pack
lawnmower
beer
if
that
were
possible
dtrue
to
its
purpose
this
is
a
very
refreshing
albeit
strong
i
liked
its
simplicity
and
some
of
the
fruits
really
set
this
beer
apart
from
others
although
the
abv
is
beyond
what
would
be
traditional
it
is
well
masked
and
i
didnt
think
it
detracted
from
the
overall
experience
worth
trying
but
i
dont
know
if
i
will
buy
it
again
o
pretty
nice
not
something
im
gonna
buy
for
just
myself
again
a
little
too
sweet
to
drink
the
whole
bottle
alone
a
very
approachable
beer
the
cuvee
des
jonquilles
is
light
in
color
and
gravity
with
a
sweet
floral
aroma
and
a
grainy
wheaty
texture
one
of
the
breadier
bier
de
gardes
ive
yet
had
a
nice
bottle
to
uncork
at
a
celebration
or
with
a
label
like
that
maybe
the
start
of
spring
d
very
smooth
a
dry
im
not
sure
the
bottle
date
its
been
sitting
in
my
brew
shop
for
a
what
looks
like
a
few
months
im
a
little
disappointing
by
the
smell
the
taste
is
good
but
i
wanted
a
bit
more
herb
then
vegetable
the
mouthfeel
is
what
sets
this
one
a
apart
from
other
beers
for
me
very
easy
to
drink
with
just
the
right
bite
when
needed
im
getting
another
taste
has
some
peach
lemon
some
apple
and
a
bit
of
funk
and
a
dry
crisp
finish
the
best
example
ive
yet
encountered
of
the
blond
variant
of
the
style
smooth
traditional
simple
and
perfectly
crafted

overall
this
was
one
of
the
more
complex
biere
de
gardes
that
i
remember
having
a
refreshing
beer
thats
worth
a
shot
if
you
see
it
around
all
in
all
a
very
well
done
beer
in
the
classic
french
saison
style
this
was
described
by
simon
at
cave
à
bulles
as
typical
of
northern
french
beer
if
you
see
one
it
is
certainly
worth
a
try
drinkability
is
very
high
although
i
have
a
sense
of
preciousness
about
this
bottle
compounded
by
how
satisfying
it
tastes
that
leaves
me
milking
ever
last
drop
this
beer
is
a
true
masterpiece
drink
yeah
pretty
nice
soft
vanilla
and
old
lemon
in
the
fore
with
sweet
grains
and
malt
tongue
tickling
and
herbal
bitter
through
the
middle
the
finish
is
malt
lemongrass
and
a
hint
of
bannanalike
german
hefe
flavor
pretty
interesting
beer
a
touch
sweet
but
still
very
drinkable
and
tasty

2008
just
opening
the
cage
of
this
750
was
enough
to
get
a
big
explosion
and
spot
on
sealling
where
cork
hit
some
gushing
following
but
luckily
after
opening
some
other
french
brew
yesterday
i
learned
not
to
trust
french
ones
only
misssed
first
foam
and
rest
saved
in
glas
gave
a
wonderfull
nice
lasting
white
head
and
very
pale
golden
beer
thats
hazy
nose
is
very
bretty
dry
grass
pepperspice
and
phenolic
but
overall
smooth
that
i
find
strange
for
a
bett
beer
taste
is
very
wheaty
brett
spiced
not
noticable
7
and
well
balanced
all
together
maybe
carbon
dioxide
level
bit
high
for
a
save
opening
of
the
bottle
but
fitting
the
taste
well
and
just
a
fine
brew
to
drink
on
a
quiet
evening
the
beer
literally
explodes
out
of
the
bottle
as
soon
as
the
cork
is
nudged
settles
into
the
tulip
very
pale
and
slightly
cloudy
yellow
a
thin
sheen
of
meringuelike
head
and
good
lace
peppery
and
tartly
lemony
aroma
with
coarse
grain
yeast
and
hop
background
airy
thin
body
with
crazily
vivacious
carbonation
powdery
sweet
tart
lime
and
lemon
flavors
a
grainy
and
slightly
musty
yeast
center
dries
to
a
wellhopped
finish
a
bit
thin
in
flavor
compared
to
others
but
quite
refreshing
overall
pale
straw
green
at
the
edges
beautiful
volcanic
head
which
flashes
away
after
a
bit
leaving
just
a
little
lace
it
looks
crisp
and
fresh
like
granny
smith
apples
smells
of
tangerine
grassy
hops
lemon
and
melon
the
taste
springs
spicy
peppery
from
a
mild
hoppy
start
to
a
smooth
balanced
malt
flavor
long
herbal
finish
a

with
a
healthy

touch
to
balance
the

but
it
is
still
a
touch
too
sweet
for
the
style
as
i
know
it
at
least
that
said
i
have
to
admit
this
is
one
of
the
most
enjoyable
and
approachable
biere

crisp

found
this
quite

i
would
have
had
another

if
it
was
available
their

great

is
maintained

for

captivating
beers
elements
of
time
and
place
either
evaporate
entirely
or
they
are
irrefutably
reinforced
this
beer
does
neither
it
embodies
neither
the
proud
often
overlooked
french
brewing
tradition
nor
the
proper
capacities
of
the
bière
de
garde
style
while
its
a
fine
enough
beer
it
doesnt
leave
much
to
recommend
it
for
o
at

this
is
incredibly
smooth
easy
drinking
and
dangerously
drinkable
easily
one
of
the
smoothest
8ers
ive
ever
had
i
will
be
grabbing
another
bottle
of
this
pale
amber
colour
2
fingers
of
fluffy
white
head
good
lace
here
as
well
smell
is
yeasty
with
a
bit
of
spice
apple
and
candied
fruits
crisp
grainy
malts
with
just
a
bit
of
lemony
hop
finished
with
more
spice
and
some
earthy
points
taste
goes
south
a
bit
here
some
of
that
candied
fruit
from
the
nose
light
bitterness
but
moderatley
sweet
all
the
way
through
hard
candy
flavours
with
a
odd
smoke
like
flavour
toward
the
finish
here
medium
carbonation
and
medium
body
pretty
nice
feel
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
am
begining
to
suspect
that
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
style
though
still
fairly
drinkable
and
would
drink
it
again
if
someone
handed
me
a
glass
but
otherwise
im
not
going
looking
for
it
overall
good
not
great
worth
trying
once
but
not
something
that
really
stands
out
enough
to
buy
again
it
became
a
little
boring
to
get
through
the
750ml
size
bottle
overall
decent
but
not
great
not
something
i
would
return
to
jd
overall
i
enjoyed
the
experience
would
i
race
out
to
grab
another
no
would
i
recommend
trying
this
for
the
biere
de
garde
novice
sure
i
will
say
i
would
love
to
try
this
from
the
source
overall
a
good
summer
beer
but
know
the
8abv
sneeks
up
on
you
not
a
terrible
brew
overall
decent
id
have
it
again
but
not
often
o
a
fine
clean
biere
de
garde
a
little
overpriced
but
id
definitely
seek
out
another
bottle
and
open
it
at
a
more
appropriate
time
of
the
year
a
delicious
belgian
pale
alegolden
ale
thats
kinda
what
i
like
to
think
is
similar
to
the
monks
paterbiers
but
im
used
to
more
aged
character
or
even
a
more
corklike
woodiness
in
beers
listed
in
the
biere
de
garde
style
o
i
havent
had
a
lot
of
beers
in
this
style
this
one
isnt
bad
although
i
dont
think
the
style
is
to
my
liking
still
an
ok
tasting
beer
i
dont
regret
the
purchase
o
a
beautiful
bière
de
garde
well
worth
seeking
out
dr
disguises
its
abv
remarkably
well
but
fails
to
offer
the
wealth
of
flavour
expected
for
the
style
and
presentation
fairly
drinkable
but
disappointing
overall
not
really
worth
a
go
unless
youre
into
generic
wouldbe
abbey
beers
carbonation
seems
to
belie
the
big
head
it
feels
a
bit
thin
and
i
think
more
bubbles
would
give
it
a
very
nice
pop
to
it
picked
this
up
at
a
wegmans
in
buffalo
because
i
thought
it
looked
interesting
pours
a
bubbly
orange
colour
with
thick
white
head
great
head
retention
with
lots
of
lacing
on
the
glass
smells
of
grassy
hops
with
some
sort
of
fruitiness
lots
of
yeast
in
the
aroma
too
fairly
sweet
flavour
im
really
enjoying
this
beer
i
would
definitely
have
this
again
poured
into
a
glass
and
there
was
a
decent
amount
of
head
smell
is
very
good
with
a
light
amount
of
fruit
this
beer
is
very
smooth
with
a
great
feel
the
beer
has
a
sweetness
to
it
and
a
nice
flavor
just
a
well
made
ale
it
would
be
good
to
have
after
dinner

sweat
yeasty
smell
this
isnt
a
complex
beer
it
had
a
nice
sweet
taste
there
were
hints
of
pear
and
apple
it
was
smooth
as
the
alcohol
was
well
hidden
its
possible
to
drink
a
few
of
these
but
it
could
get
dangerous
at
this
strength
this
one
starts
off
so
nicely
in
its
presentation
and
it
starts
to
lose
me
at
the
first
sip
i
still
found
myself
finishing
the
whole
bottle
with
the
help
of
some
blue
cheese
and
crackers
which
it
paired
with
exceptionally
it
is
pretty
good
they
could
have
dialed
down
the
sweetness
but
other
than
that
a
solid
subtle
brew
easier
to
take
this
one
down
with
a
better
mouthfeel
a
little
slick
and
it
seems
to
showcase
every
tenth
of
the
8
5
abv
d
while
this
isnt
the
best
beer
for
the
style
its
still
a
damn
good
beer
that
i
could
drink
again
worth
picking
up
to
try
sometime
d
a
pretty
good
beer
alcohol
isnt
really
noticeable
in
the
flavor
the
brewers
did
a
good
job
of
disquising
it
a
nice
beer
that
drinks
well
easy
enough
for
anyone
to
drink
yet
has
complexity
to
satisfy
the
beer
geeks
bronze
alcohol
if
this
one
might
think
in
a
beer
of
this
abv
in
the
mouth
the
hops
are
good
but
a
little
too
quiet
rather
we
perceive
the
sun
cereals
which
are
inevitably
think
of
cakes
or
biscuits
wheat
just
baked
so
rather
fine
taste
slightly
woody
aroma
with
a
bitter
aftertaste
rather
light
taste
has
a
base
of
light
caramel
dextrine
malt
which
gives
the
beer
a
nice
malty
backbone
the
yeast
adds
a
fruity
character
with
notes
of
apricot
and
apple
bitterness
is
low
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
too
sticky
this
beer
appears
to
be
quite
similar
to
duvel
but
without
the
dryness
and
bitterness
out
of
a
bottle
this
beer
was
a
slightly
hazy
tangerinegold
color
the
head
was
a
half
finger
of
yellowtinted
foam
that
faded
to
a
skim
that
left
pretty
good
lacing
in
sliding
curtains
the
aroma
was
totally
appropriate
for
a
biere
de
garde
caramel
malt
spicy
hops
fruity
esters
and
yeast
the
flavors
were
quite
similar
and
enjoyable
with
a
well
balanced
malt
profile
an
alcohol
punch
in
the
middle
and
a
clean
finish
the
caramel
malt
really
came
off
clearly
and
was
well
met
by
the
fruit
notes
and
citrusy
hops
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
the
body
medium
and
the
carbonation
good
biere
de
garde
is
a
difficult
style
to
make
well
and
this
was
one
of
the
best
ive
ever
tried
it
was
a
beautiful
day
outside
worked
for
8
hours
just
went
for
a
40
mile
bike
ride
get
back
to
my
house
and
cracked
this
bottle
open
and
sat
outside
in
the
sun
on
my
deck
and
just
relaxed
i
couldnt
have
asked
for
more
you
wont
be
disappointed
if
your
looking
for
a
good
beer
to
just
relax
with
pretty
drinkable
i
wouldnt
go
looking
too
hard
but
i
would
enjoy
this
one
again
the
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
creamy
leaving
almost
no
bitterness
on
the
tounge
a
very
drinkable
beer
to
say
the
least
drinkability
a
very
different
biere
de
garde
but
the
combination
of
the
sweet
and
herbally
bitter
flavors
dont
cut
it
for
me
d
its
very
drinkable
and
any
tastes
of
alcohol
are
well
hidden
this
beer
would
make
a
perfect
complement
to
a
nice
dinner
with
french
food
this
beer
is
lacking
toasty
caramel
and
cellarlike
notes
that
are
supposed
to
mark
the
style
on
the
other
hand
it
has
enough
tartness
and
spicing
to
resemble
its
close
relative
a
belgian
saisson
it
is
better
than
most
macros
that
can
be
found
on
the
shelves
locally
but
nothing
that
i
would
go
back
to
at
least
not
on
a
regular
basis
from
the
750
ml
bottle
marked

2010
served
about
45
degrees
as
i
popped
the
plastic
cork
often
found
on
these
french
beers
it
really
opened
with
exhileration
and
a
nice
puff
of
carbonated
mist
the
aroma
was
noticeable
right
out
of
the
bottle
before
pouring
the
pour
was
a
cloudy
orangepale
yellow
with
an
eager
foamy
white
head
that
fizzles
down
after
a
few
moments
but
leaves
a
thin
lacing
all
around
the
glass
the
aroma
bursts
with
sensations
of
wheat
malts
coriander
and
other
tantalizing
spices
the
flavor
has
a
bitter
tanginess
with
a
dry
finale
of
hops
and
spices
while
the
aroma
had
a
nondistinct
alcohol
scent
the
taste
had
a
bit
more
alcohol
in
the
mix
drinkable
if
by
drinkable
you
mean
it
is
easy
to
drink
quickly
then
i
would
have
to
say
yes
it
was
easier
to
drink
this
one
than
savor
it
the
8
abv
hit
me
lightly
at
the
end
it
had
its
own
variety
of
characteristics
which
were
commendable
on
the
face
of
it
but
i
still
tend
to
favor
belgian
abbey
ales
at
least
over
this
one
from
france
still
it
was
not
a
bad
beer
overall
i
found
it
in
the
price
chopper
grocery
store
in
keene
n
h
it
was
kind
of
a
standalone
among
the
typical
nationally
known
macro
and
micro
brews
you
see
in
grocery
stores
or
other
bottle
shops
d
very
drinkable
but
the
overall
flavor
is
somewhat
generic
poured
a
clear
light
orange
bronze
colour
with
a
snow
white
foamy
craggy
head
smell
was
average
for
the
style
with
its
mild
barnyard
funk
taste
was
mildly
bitter
with
some
nicem
european
style
hops
and
mildly
sweet
too
a
very
gentle
beer
to
be
85
mouthfeel
to
me
was
a
bit
light
to
be
so
high
in
abv
very
easy
drinking
beer
all
things
considered
and
solidly
crafted
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
d
fairly
drinkable
but
not
entirely
flavorful
enough
to
keep
me
intrigued
nice
brew
drinkability
this
is
drinkable
and
somewhat
malty
ill
drink
this
one
but
i
have
a
feeling
that
it
will
be
my
last
for
a
long
time
the
other
will
wait
in
my
cellar
and
will
be
kept
hopefully
until
it
becomes
better
out
of
a
750ml
swing
cap
bottle
pours
a
pale
copper
color
with
a
very
nice
dense
white
head
that
left
a
wall
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
brew
has
a
fruity
nose
some
oxidized
grapes
sweetened
granny
smith
apple
skins
and
hay
there
is
quite
a
candied
aroma
to
it
the
taste
is
of
a
weak
caramel
and
apple
juice
there
is
barely
enough
caramel
malt
to
carry
the
biere
de
garde
classification
the
feel
is
quite
light
and
has
soft
carbonation
which
leads
to
a
flat
feel
an
average
biere
de
garde
at
best
not
nearly
malty
enough
it
is
a
bit
tinlike
but
holds
it
own
a
very
blah
biere
de
garde
i
would
like
to
see
more
caramel
malt
to
bring
this
brew
around
overall
i
think
this
beer
is
decent
nothing
special
or
something
to
go
crazy
in
a
search
for
but
worth
a
try
fairly
drinkable
rather
good
easy
drinking
and
pleasant
d
i
could
drink
this
up
like
no
other
but
for
the
price
i
will
pass
ddecent

to

again
overall
this
beer
is
okay
i
dont
really
find
it
to
be
very
enjoyable
to
drink
as
this
is
not
my
kind
of
beer
d
this
is
a

abv
is

in
this
one
maybe
because
the

its

buy

pleasant
beer
to
drink
assuming
you
can
get
used
to
the
funky
nose
if
you
like
witbiers
this
beer
may
be
a
good
transition
into
the
world
of
funk
as
it
possesses
qualities
of
both
an
interesting
beer
that
went
well
with
the
french
dinner
but
at
at
8
had
to
go
light
as
i
could
feel
the
effects
of
just
two
nicely
complex
and
enjoyable
d
i
really
dig
this
beer
a
great
representation
of
the
style
im
impressed
that
there
is
still
some
hop
bitterness
as
this
brew
is
getting
close
to
its
best
before
date
this
is
totally
a
beer
to
pair
with
food
the
acidity
and
the
minerality
make
this
brew
a
great
fit
with
mussels
scallops
or
oysters
and
the
fruity
notes
would
make
this
a
match
for
a
fresh
goats
milk
cheese
or
a
wedge
cut
from
a
younger
fruitier
wheel
of
cabot
clothbound
drinkability
a
bière
de
garde
with
nice
subtle
nuances
and
surprisingly
quaffable
considering
the
abv
percentage
d
the
ale
doesnt
taste
as
heavy
as
it
is
both
a
blessing
and
a
curse
an
enjoyable
ale
that
is
taking
me
a
long
time
to
get
through
i
could
throw
back
the
whole
bottle
though
id
choose
castelains
biere
de
garde
over
this
one
drinkability
overall
a
decent
beer
for
my
first
biere
de
garde
very
similar
to
a
saison
which
i
think
its
supposed
too
d
excellent
i
could
drink
this
stuff
till
i
went
blind
well
worth
a
try
the
mouthfeel
is
right
on
a
bit
of
sweetness
up
front
but
finishes
nice
and
dry
carbonation
is
light
but
ok
overall
a
very
nice
bdg
some
yeast
notes
are
over
the
top
but
still
tasty
d
kinda
pick
up
the
alcohol
in
the
aftertaste
but
very
minimal
enough
going
on
to
where
its
worth
trying
out
again
this
is
a
very
tasty
sweetish
and
floral
belgianesque
beer
there
is
a
slightly
sharp
bite
in
the
beer
that
is
more
from
the
yeast
than
i
think
from
any
residual
spices
added
this
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
an
8
abv
that
is
well
hidden
there
are
some
orange
rind
flavors
some
slight
citrus
notes
some
golden
blossom
as
well
a
very
complex
big
palated
beer
that
is
a
delight
to
drink
well
worth
seeking
out
lchaim
this
beer
pours
a
cloudy
golden
orange
color
the
head
is
two
inches
in
height
and
recedes
slowly
into
a
firm
half
inch
cap
of
foam
and
leaves
sticky
lacing
all
down
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
barnyard
funk
with
leathery
notes
and
a
nice
bready
malt
backbone
the
taste
is
more
malty
than
the
aroma
there
is
still
some
funk
but
it
is
more
in
the
background
the
finish
is
of
nice
lingering
toasty
malt
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumfull
bodied
with
lively
carbonation
and
a
velvety
texture
overall
i
really
like
this
beer
and
i
would
love
to
drink
it
again
i
split
this
with
a
friend
and
i
didnt
really
feel
the
desire
to
have
more
than
half
a
bottle
decent
but
after
this
we
opened
up
la
goudale
and
we
both
preferred
that
d
not
hard
to
drink
although
i
dont
know
i
would
drink
too
much
one
bottle
was
all
i
needed
to
know
what
the
beer
tasted
like
and
might
not
get
it
again
it
didnt
taste
too
special
i
havent
been
blown
away
by
any
of
the
three
les
brasseurs
de
gayant
offerings
that
have
found
their
way
into
my
glass
la
divine
might
be
worth
a
look
if
you
love
the
style
and
think
a
french
biere
de
garde
sounds
interesting
for
me
its
one
and
done
once
again
a
fine
beer
from
france
i
really
must
try
and
get
some
more
when
the
chance
arises
ok
i
mainly
bought
this
because
it
came
in
a
cool
bottle
it
turned
out
to
be
a
great
tasting
and
balanced
beer
but
not
something
i
would
really
seek
out
d
it
goes
down
easy
for
a
beer
at
8
5
but
im
in
no
hurry
to
have
another
unfortunately
it
doesnt
have
most
of
the
desirable
characteristics
of
a
bière
de
garde
bottle
poured
a
clear
golden
color
ale
with
a
large
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
minimal
lacing
aroma
of
dry
malt
with
some
traces
of
dms
taste
is
also
dominated
by
notes
of
dms
with
some
lightly
sweet
caramel
malt
notes
no
spices
or
ester
form
the
yeast
are
really
noticeable
and
dms
is
a
bit
too
omnipresent
medium
body
with
good
carbonation
and
no
apparent
alcohol
pours
a
pale
orangeyellow
color
with
a
nice
bubbly
threefinger
head
that
had
very
good
retention
and
left
behind
some
very
lovely
lacing
aroma
is
reminiscent
of
orval
some
sweet
flavor
is
lightly
sweet
a
bit
of
light
fruit
taste
to
it
some
pears
and
orange
comes
to
mind
hints
of
lemon
and
grass
very
nice
its
sort
of
light
bodied
and
the
flavors
arent
screaming
out
at
me
but
its
very
tasty
nonetheless
easily
drinkable
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
plus
the
bottle
will
come
in
handy
for
homebrewing

pours
a
clear
golden
yellow
with
a
big
dense
white
head
that
hangs
around
for
a
while
leaving
decent
lacing
the
aroma
is
very
bready
with
some
toasted
grains
and
corn
on
top
of
the
subtle
belgian
yeast
maybe
some
spices
in
the
nose
as
well
the
taste
mirrors
the
aroma
with
toasted
grains
and
spices
along
with
a
little
alcohol
presence
coming
through
in
the
finish
there
is
a
sweetness
that
grows
as
the
beer
warms
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
clean
with
a
slightly
dry
finish
an
interesting
beer
that
didnt
stand
out
in
any
way
for
me
overall
classified
as
a
biere
de
garde
this
could
almost
pass
as
a
tripel
but
for
a
lack
of
phenolic
forwardness
very
nice
beer
definitely
worth
seeking
out
if
you
are
a
fan
of
the
style
this
one
made
me
wonder
i
knew
the
french
were
not
exactly
known
for
their
beers
and
the
price
for
a
750
ml
bottle
being
4
99
really
makes
you
wonder
why
so
cheap
i
still
think
this
is
a
good
deal
for
what
it
is
that
fullish
mouthfeel
and
lower
carbonation
coupled
with
the
emerging
brettanomyces
character
tells
me
this
beer
might
very
well
age
gracefully
changing
all
along
the
way
just
like
orval
a
year
or
two
from
now
it
should
be
drier
more
effervescent
and
very
earthy
yumm
i
think
ill
get
a
couple
of
bottles
to
forget
in
the
back
of
the
fridge
and
see
how
they
are
next
year
the
aroma
is
yeasty
and
sweet
with
malt
and
spice
the
appearance
is
golden
with
a
better
than
average
head
and
nice
lacing
left
on
the
glass
the
flavor
is
like
the
aroma
and
fairly
well
balanced
with
some
emphasis
on
the
sweet
the
palate
is
thin
overall
its
nice
with
a
slightly
fruity
finish
d
my
first
beer
of
this
style
and
i
have
to
say
i
was
impressed
this
could
be
a
really
great
warm
weather
alternative
to
heavier
bodied
belgian
ales
or
to
pair
with
food
i
could
certainly
see
myself
having
more
of
this
around
the
house
highly
recommended
a
very
drinkable
solid
beer
for
this
style
that
quite
honestly
took
me
by
surprise
this
was
brewed
in
france
d
good
drinkability
a
very
approachable
beer
i
could
happily
drink
this
sitting
outside
enjoying
the
afternoon
in
a
french
cafe
a
great
beer
and
quite
possibly
the
best
french
beer
i
have
had
to
date
m
a
rich
medium
body
smooth
carbonation
and
feel
goes
down
nicely
not
really
anything
huge
going
on
but
a
safe
and
inoffensive
this
is
really
excellent
beer
and
i
would
say
the
same
about
the
other
two
beers
ive
had
from
les
brasseurs
de
gayant
i
think
this
is
kind
of
a
benchmark
for
beers
internationally
i
wish
this
was
supermarket
beer
drinkability
a
decent
even
borderline
good
beer
alcohols
a
little
high
though
not
for
the
style
all
in
all
its
an
attractive
pleasant
smelling
nice
feeling
beer
but
just
not
interesting
enough
to
send
me
back
for
more
i
dont
believe
still
worth
trying
at
least
once
i
was
quite
impressed
with
this
stuff
very
glad
i
decided
to
pick
it
up
very
disappointed
it
was
the
last
one
on
the
shelf
it
reminds
me
a
lot
of
some
of
the
more
vibrant
belgian
strong
pale
ales
if
that
is
your
bag
it
really
isnt
mine
id
check
it
out
mouthfeel
is
light
and
very
dry
the
carbonation
gives
a
creamy
texture
an
interesting
selection
indeed
d
damn
for
the
type
of
beer
i
was
expecting
something
closer
to
a
saison
or
even
tripel
but
this
is
superb
it
actually
has
enough
malt
character
to
balance
out
the
interesting
but
often
overwhelming
phenolic
characteristics
i
wont
have
much
of
a
problem
downing
the
whole
bottle
this
evening
tmd
taste
is
smooth
and
slighty
malty
sweet
again
reminiscent
of
a
triple
with
less
of
that
candy
sugar
sweetness
and
less
complexity
it
has
a
slightly
crisp
aftertaste
too
an
interesting
beer
that
ill
try
again
purchased
plaza
liquors
tucson
az
although
not
what
i
would
think
of
as
a
hot
weather
beer
it
will
be
great
with
any
traditional
summer
foods
you
are
serving
especially
a
good
homemade
brat
an
ok
beer
but
it
is
just
that
ok
not
outstanding
nothing
bad
about
it
but
it
just
doesnt
make
you
say
wow
this
beer
poured
a
clear
yellow
gold
color
and
formed
a
nice
foamy
white
head
that
coated
the
glass
with
lace
as
it
quickly
subsided
a
small
amount
of
carbonation
is
present
an
aroma
of
malt
spices
yeast
and
a
slight
barnyard
background
the
flavor
was
of
malt
yeast
and
spices
that
i
cant
really
separate
the
body
is
medium
light
and
slightly
creamy
the
finish
is
slightly
tart
not
a
bad
beer
this
artisanal
brew
from
france

just
hit

very

some

overall
a
decent
beer
to
be
sure
much
like
a
stronger
belgian
pale
or
a
lighter
triple
but
this
one
showcased
a
good
array
of
flavors
and
drank
away
quite
easily
must
be
pretty
widely
available
in
france
so
a
worthy
choice
if
youre
in
a
pinch
overall
though
i
found
much
that
was
unpleasant
in
this
beer
theres
not
a
lot
of
structure
or
pleasant
flavours
to
it
even
looking
at
the
positives
and
with
the
nasty
characters
coming
through
it
verges
on
genuinely
offensive
not
one
ill
be
picking
up
again
pours
out
a
rich
honey
body
with
a
thin
whipped
egg
white
head
smells
of
bready
malts
faint
yeast
alcohol
and
earthy
hop
flavor
is
of
honey
bread
floral
hops
with
a
punch
of
alcohol
that
seems
a
bit
out
of
place
seeing
as
this
already
has
a
year
on
it
light
acidity
comes
in
to
refresh
the
palate
a
bit
mouthfeel
is
chewy
with
tonguescrubbing
bubbles
not
the
best
biere
de
garde
ive
had
but
a
good
example
of
one
clean
golden
color
good
head
formation
with
medium
retention
in
the
nose
the
spicy
and
earth
of
yeast
and
hops
can
be
detected
maltiness
in
second
plan
the
taste
is
spicy
too
with
sweetness
of
malts
predominaiting
low
bitterness
and
hop
flavor
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
a
bit
too
sweet
though
it
is
not
a
super
complex
beer
but
still
flavorful
the
appearance
of
this
beer
was
striking
strawberry
coppery
blonde
with
very
little
head
it
looked
wonderful
in
my
delirium
tremens
chalice
the
smell
was
nothing
to
write
home
about
a
little
bit
of
hop
and
light
sweet
malt
but
really
not
a
lot
in
this
department
i
really
enjoyed
the
flavor
of
this
beer
as
did
my
wife
great
balance
of
hop
and
malt
swaying
ever
so
slightly
toward
the
hops
light
floral
and
just
a
little
citrusy
the
mouthfeel
was
decent
a
little
too
sharp
for
a
great
rating
but
certainly
pleasant
overall
we
really
enjoyed
it
this
was
our
first
venture
into
this
style
but
i
have
a
feeling
we
will
be
coming
back
to
it
quite
soon
a
decent
one
nonetheless

the
beer
was
excellent
hint
of
opium
on
the
nose
glad
i
have
one
more
o
this
beer
is
soft
creamy
and
clean
it
is
not
too
complex
and
doesnt
stand
out
in
any
particular
area
but
it
is
a
very
enjoyable
and
wellmade
biere
de
garde
o
average
beer
and
drinkability
not
that
bad
for
a
french
ale
overall
the
first
sip
i
had
of
this
was
great
lots
going
on
with
the
sweetness
and
the
bitter
and
the
various
earthy
and
musty
notes
but
as
i
got
more
into
the
beer
a
lot
of
the
weaknesses
began
to
come
through
its
a
pretty
light
beer
which
doesnt
pair
will
with
the
big
flavor
notes
certainly
better
than
an
average
beer
but
not
blowing
my
mind
overall
i
really
like
the
look
of
this
beer
the
taste
is
subdued
compared
to
what
i
expect
it
could
taste
like
comparing
to
equally
tasting
brews
this
could
be
a
lot
stronger
tasting
i
think
and
who
really
expects
much
from
the
french
anyway
their
domain
lies
in
other
areas
considering
ive
been
dealing
with
an
unusual
bout
of
insomnia
and
looking
for
the
antidote
here
i
was
expecting
a
stronger
bittersweet
taste
due
to
the
higher
abv
and
im
finding
i
really
like
this
i
have
had
it
before
but
it
it
didnt
st
ick
out
enough
for
me
to
remember
any
of
the
qualities
and
im
paying
much
more
attention
to
the
taste
now
for
the
overall
score
i
suppose
i
wish
there
were
a
medium
score
available
between
an
80
and
90
because
this
is
where
i
am
stuck
perhaps
a
refill
will
help
the
obligatory
eruction
burp
helps
me
decide
ill
give
it
a
4
5
due
to
the
manly
taste
but
the
scoring
part
is
always
difficult
most
brews
have
their
own
special
presence
do
they
not
only
the
commercial
products
pretty
much
are
put
out
for
the
masses
and
there
are
some
good
ones
but
mostly
crafted
to
appeal
to
the
masses
the
tasting
is
difficult
for
me
because
a
brewer
puts
in
what
he
thinks
will
be
special
and
if
it
gets
past
his
standards
then
its
a
product
worthy
of
scoring
some
breweries
put
out
beers
like
stones
chipotle
and
vanilla
which
more
or
less
seem
to
satisfy
a
need
to
put
forth
a
collection
regardless
of
how
good
it
might
be
and
for
those
it
just
doesnt
seem
like
it
was
a
great
bit
of
work
put
forth
in
the
battle
cry
of
pride
but
more
for
a
profit
maybe
the
lack
of
sleep
is
kicking
in
prost
oan
interesting
and
pretty
tasty
beer
good
blend
of
flavors
pours
a
hazy
orange
with
a
foamy
tan
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
thin
rings
of
lace
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
grain
fruits
and
grape
juice
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
very
sweet
and
fruity
flavor
there
is
a
slight
alcohol
kick
with
each
sip
as
well
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
is
pretty
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
jd
overall
this
beer
is
really
singing
to
me
not
sure
if
this
is
typical
biere
de
grade
style
but
to
me
it
seems
like
a
european
blonde
mixed
with
citrusy
kolsch
or
even
a
blanche
beer
without
the
unfiltered
wheat
characteristics
worth
trying
for
sure
if
you
can
get
it
i
will
get
this
again
o
a
pretty
good
beer
easy
to
drink
and
refreshing
with
a
fair
amount
of
flavor
for
such
a
light
brew
i
wish
that
it
wasnt
quite
so
bitter
because
after
a
few
sips
that
starts
to
overwhelm
1001
beers
blog
httpabarwithnoname
wordpress
com
light
mouthfeel
and
refreshing
but
also
a
bit
bland
abv
is
respectable
a
notable
sweet
adjunct
flavor
i
am
not
hugely
fond
of
pretty
unique
though
sampled
on
april
7
2012
at
the
keene
nh
beerfest
the
pour
is
golden
with
a
white
head
and
good
retention
the
aroma
is
malty
and
yeasty
but
hops
are
hard
to
discover
the
body
falls
into
the
light
to
medium
range
the
taste
is
quite
sweet
with
malts
it
almost
seems
like
overkill
there
is
a
thin
hop
character
that
is
next
to
impossible
to
find
this
is
one
of
those
beers
i
have
wanted
to
try
but
i
am
glad
i
got
to
try
it
at
a
brewfest
rather
than
spend
the
10
for
it
i
enjoyed
this
beer
from
poured
from
a
750
ml
bottle
the
beer
appeared
a
brownish
to
orange
color
rust
perhaps
with
a
big
cap
of
white
foam
the
aroma
seems
to
be
fermented
grain
in
character
this
cellared
malt
reappears
in
the
flavor
profile
some
sweetness
while
the
spice
at
the
end
is
muted
the
palate
is
dry
it
tastes
fine
but
i
would
like
to
see
a
little
more
complex
earthiness
synonym
of
quality
for
connoisseurs
symbol
of
quality
for
beer
lovers
a
hearty
beer
to
be
enjoyed
amongst
friends
without
doubt
goudale
from
gayant
brewers
is
a
beer
everyone
can
agree
to
enjoy
not
an
especially
memorable
ale
though
it
does
distinguish
itself
with
a
subtle
flourish
of
funk
albeit
finishing
a
little
too
sweet
to
be
as
refreshing
as
the
better
examples
of
the
style
mouthfeel
although
it
is
7
2
i
do
not
taste
to
much
alcohol
it
is
a
nice
thing
but
i
only
pick
up
a
overwhelming
carbonated
feeling
that
makes
everything
else
as
far
as
taste
diminish
which
i
wish
was
not
the
case
i
do
not
know
if
it
is
just
me
but
i
am
happy
i
tried
it
yet
i
probably
will
not
but
but
another
bottle
in
the
future
overall
i
was
drinking
these
every
other
day
last
year
during
a
hot
summer
in
toulouse
i
took
a
liking
to
them
then
although
it
was
before
i
got
more
serious
with
craft
beers
i
still
think
this
is
a
decent
beer
though
even
if
there
are
far
better
kinds
of
bières
de
garde
out
there
overall
the
best
thing
about
this
biere
de
garde
is
the
price
and
the
fact
it
goes
down
like
water
and
about
as
forgettable
too
strong
taste
malty
where
alcohol
is
unfortunately
quickly
over
not
really
other
flavors
if
only
worn
a
few
grains
such
as
wheat
that
are
spread
in
the
aftertaste
the
nose
is
slightly
chilled
with
a
characteristic
hint
of
honey
sour
aftertaste
unpleasant
feature
of
lagers
and
bland
and
with
too
much
alcohol
in
the
body
goudale
good
ale
drinkability
its
a
very
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
with
good
flavours
and
aromas
its
an
overall
good
beer
dr
high
abv
low
quality
and
fairly
high
pricing
its
nothing
worth
trying
la
goudale
is
on
the
lighter
side
of
mediumbodied
despite
the
active
visible
carbonation
you
dont
really
feel
it
prickle
your
tongue
that
smoothness
compliments
the
amber
malt
flavors
overall
this
is
a
good
biere
de
garde
i
dont
personally
see
myself
buying
it
again
but
someone
that
really
enjoys
american
amber
ales
should
definitely
seek
this
beer
out
accessible
palate
expansion
andor
a
rustic
belgian
beer
for
people
that
dont
like
funk
cheers
pours
with
little
head
but
very
carbonated
some
lacing
the
smell
is
somewhat
sweet
and
malty
with
a
hint
of
fruit
the
taste
is
a
a
bit
sharp
on
the
tongue
due
to
the
7
8
abv
it
has
a
slight
metallic
aftertaste
i
would
like
to
see
this
beer
with
a
lower
alcohol
content
and
aged
a
bit
more
before
bottling
subduing
the
alcohol
on
the
palate
would
bring
out
the
subtleties
it
pours
with
a
small
amount
of
head
the
head
is
built
from
a
lot
of
small
bubbles
that
dissipate
very
quickly
the
smell
has
has
a
very
sweet
almost
sugary
smell
to
it
the
taste
is
a
light
bodied
beer
with
flavors
of
hops
oranges
and
apricots
the
after
taste
is
refreshing
and
leaves
a
sweet
taste
in
the
mouth
this
is
a
good
beer
to
have
for
dinner
cheers
the
mouthfeel
was
sharp
bitter
and
tangy
easy
to
drink
but
more
middle
of
the
road
than
exciting
a
nonoffensive
sort
of
beer
a
little
lacking
in
flavour
the
hop
content
blending
in
and
hiding
too
much
behind
the
grains
within
the
brew
i
have
had
this
in
europe
and
now
in
america
and
i
havent
noticed
a
difference
in
the
aroma
and
flavor
so
thats
a
good
thing
not
my
favorite
of
the
style
but
a
solid
brew
i
got
thru
the
bomber
but
it
was
a
chore
at
the
end
d
pretty
good
beer
but
lacks
complexity
outclassed
by
others
of
the
same
style
poured
a
clear
yellow
with
a
constant
stream
of
bubbles
and
a
thin
white
head
that
persisted
almost
the
entire
time
the
smell
was
clean
with
hints
of
pear
yeast
and
faint
citrus
the
taste
was
of
pear
with
a
very
slight
astringency
at
the
end
very
refreshing
it
was
light
in
the
mouth
with
moderately
high
carbonation
this
was
a
very
smooth
and
drinkable
beer
especially
for
the
somewhat
high
abv
id
definitely
drink
it
again
not
what
i
expected
for
this
style
but
still
a
unique
beer
drinkability
as
others
have
noted
this
is
more
of
a
belgian
golden
than
a
biere
de
garde
but
it
is
certainly
worth
a
look
d
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
nothing
that
remarkable
but
it
is
refreshing
to
some
degree
and
i
will
try
again
at
some
point
still
quite
drinkable
at
7
8
abv
solid
offering
d
i
think
the
fact
that
it
confuses
me
is
making
me
hesitant
to
drink
it
with
more
enthusiasm
but
it
is
good
just
confusing
to
me
the
metallic
aftertaste
of
this
beer
bugs
me
this
was
an
ok
biere
de
garde
its
worth
a
try
though
d
this
was
actually
a
decent
drinking
beer
it
was
clean
and
crisp
im
sure
i
would
say
the
same
about
some
light
colored
american
pilsners
but
this
beer
had
more
body
and
character
than
most
of
those
a
golden
biere
de
garde
i
guess
is
the
best
descriptor
not
something
i
would
go
after
again
but
i
definitely
enjoyed
it
drinkability
its
a
nice
beer
once
in
a
while
if
its
on
sale
again
ill
def
buy
it
4
99
for
a
750
ml
how
can
you
go
wrong
with
that
ill
drink
any
decent
750
ml
for
that
price
smells
of
belgian
yeast
medium
mouthfeel
nice
malt
and
honey
flavors
not
much
noticeable
carbonation
until
the
end
this
beer
is
extremely
refreshing
it
reminds
me
of
a
more
full
bodied
lager
oh
so
good
unfortunately
my
pallet
cannot
unfold
this
beer
anymore
but
i
can
at
least
say
i
really
like
this
beer
notes
overall
it
is
a
very
nice
biere
de
garde
with
loads
of
tasty
wheat
maltiness
everything
else
is
right
on
par
for
the
style
a
nice
aperetif
with
some
strong
cheese
sausage
and
la
goudale
not
bad
at
all
all
in
all
this
was
a
bretty
good
beer
expecially
since
it
was
from
the
clearance
rack
d
no
traces
of
alcohol
are
perceptible
in
the
taste
this
is
exceptionally
drinkable
and
would
be
great
to
pair
with
some
food
for
dinner
by
itself
the
beer
is
rather
refreshing
to
drink
a
certain
cider
vinegar
quality
that
is
quite
pleasant
but
a
bit
heavy
and
malty
for
the
style
not
bad
at
all
fairly
simple
not
something
i
will
seek
out
again
though
d
i
kinda
like
this
beer
a
bit
its
different
but
still
good
with
the
interesting
flavors
that
are
going
on
worth
a
try
sometime
appears
golden
yellow
with
an
off
white
head
that
slowly
falls
to
a
ring
smells
of
sweet
malt
and
a
little
funk
as
well
taste
is
of
sweet
malt
up
front
grass
but
has
a
little
metallic
flavor
on
the
back
end
medium
in
body
effervescent
carbonation
a
decent
beer
but
not
great
id
drink
again
but
wouldnt
purchase
my
first
french
beer
and
first
of
the
bière
de
garde
style
goudale
is
every
bit
as
good
as
the
belgian
styles
ive
been
sampling
of
late
very
nice
and
definitely
recomended
pretty
good
beer
poured
with
a
nice
foamy
frothy
white
head
and
a
little
lace
color
is
a
clear
yellow
aroma
is
earthy
yeasty
minerals
not
cloying
at
all
flavors
where
its
really
good
spicy
malty
a
bit
tart
sharp
and
understated
enticing
without
being
overdone
great
body
and
carbonation
clean
and
fresh
very
good
finish
slight
hint
of
alcohol
definitely
a
session
beer
very
easy
to
drink
light
and
clean
tasting
this
beer
could
be
a
great
gateway
beer
for
me
it
lacks
in
depth
and
sweetness
for
the
style
still
a
solid
beer
if
you
like
belgians
this
is
worth
a
try
da
really
good
beer
that
reminds
me
of
a
golden
strong
ale
will
try
pairing
wmussels
tonight
although
i
usually
go
for
something
lighter
not
something
i
will
probably
buy
again
as
it
is
not
flavorful
enough
to
warrant
the
price
but
it
is
worth
a
try
a
french
brewery
attempting
a
belgian
style
thats
a
first
for
me
pours
a
clear
dark
yellow
with
a
hint
of
rst
hue
very
nice
bubbling
beneath
a
two
finger
head
postpour
that
recedes
to
a
good
film
o
foam
strong
pilsner
like
malts
give
a
cracker
aroma
to
ths
brew
with
some
faint
herbas
from
the
french
countryside
malt
chunks
and
then
quick
chammomile
and
lavender
notes
then
a
touchingly
sweet
bread
finish
good
carboanted
palate
with
an
hebal
feel
that
lingers
quite
well
dont
even
notice
the
7
8
alcohol
in
this
brew
a
solid
beer
but
really
for
a
summer
day
very
light
for
a
biere
de
garde
ripe
banana
flavor
with
wheat
crsip
light
fruit
grass
straw
pilsner
malt
saaz
hops
alcohol
astringency
apple
and
pear
notes
a
little
funky
with
decent
drinkability
d
an
interesting
beer
but
there
is
more
complex
beers
on
the
market
if
you
havnt
had
this
one
yet
you
should
absolutely
try
this
but
for
me
i
could
have
enjoyed
a
bit
more
hops
both
floral
and
bitter
as
well
as
a
bit
more
fruit
maybe
my
expectations
was
to
drink
something
a
bit
more
like
an
esb
drinkability
overall
great
slection
i
dont
have
too
much
expereince
with
beire
de
garde
but
i
am
excited
to
try
more
i
was
not
blown
away
by
this
beer
i
found
the
flavor
to
be
a
little
flat
it
wasnt
as
interesting
or
complex
as
i
was
hoping
having
said
that
its
appearance
was
stunning
great
caramel
tint
with
good
head
retention
that
dissipated
into
sticky
lace
the
aroma
was
slightly
hoppy
lagerpilsner
like
there
was
something
familiar
and
good
about
this
brew
i
would
buy
it
again
500

quite
the
sharp

profile

the
finish
prickly
carbonation
good
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
but
at
7
2
abv
this
is
no
session
beer
even
though
it
goes
down
as
one
beware
of
this
and
at
least
have
a
snack
when
you
put
more
than
one
or
two
of
these
down
this
beer
would
likely
go
well
with
a
variety
of
poultry
dishes
or
more
substantial
fish
or
even
pork
recipes
this
is
just
an
average
drinker
with
the
high
abv
it
really
should
only
be
good
with
food
lunch
or
dinner
or
god
forbid
breakfast
a
decent
accompaniment
for
savory
food
as
for
a
beer
to
seek
out
not
so
much
many
better
out
there
as
this
is
the
first
beer
of
the
style
i
have
tried
it
is
new
territory
flavor
is
much
like
a
belgian
ale
though
lighter
not
as
heavy
in
the
malt
or
spice
profile
drinkability
is
excellent
jonathan
passow
not
bad
but
not
all
the
memorable
this
is
not
a
bad
french
brew
its
not
on
the
level
of
most
belgians
but
its
pretty
good
and
a
good
price
for
a
750ml
bottle
7
99
750
ml
bottle
poured
into
an
oversized
wine
glass
pours
an
orangeyellow
color
with
a
pretty
decent
offwhite
head
good
lacing
aroma
is
sweet
malts
some
floral
notes
a
little
boozy
and
earthiness
from
the
yeast
taste
is
similar
with
some
caramel
malts
and
a
touch
alcoholic
mouthfeel
is
very
active
medium
bodied
and
gives
a
slight
metallic
aftertaste
overall
decent
but
not
my
favorite
d
excellent
id
enjoy
a
few
of
these
ill
admit
that
im
not
a
pro
at
reviewing
beer
like
this
however
it
is
drinkable
and
if
you
can
get
past
the
alcohol
bite
it
is
worth
a
shot
its
just
different
from
what
you
may
otherwise
expect
in
a
beer
d
yes
but
there
is
so
many
more
exciting
beers
then
this
one
a
decent
beer
nothing
too
special
but
i
prefer
this
to
la
divine
theyre
pretty
similar
but
i
prefer
the
floral
aspects
and
the
dry
finish
in
this
beer
this
beer
pours
a
clear
golden
color
the
head
is
a
half
inch
in
height
and
recedes
slowly
into
a
nice
cap
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
barnyard
funk
leather
and
hints
of
lemon
the
taste
has
a
slight
malt
sweetness
with
mellow
funky
yeast
notes
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumfull
bodied
with
nice
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
nothing
special
i
could
drink
it
again
but
there
are
so
many
better
beers
out
there
for
the
same
price
or
less
honey
golden
with
a
huge
pillowy
head
with
a
fine
meranguelike
consistency
leaves
some
fine
lace
on
the
glass
smells
of
apples
and
clove
some
faint
grassy
hops
tastes
of
mild
fruit
and
gingerbread
with
just
enough
hop
bitterness
to
balance
grows
slightly
more
complex
as
it
warms
a
up
a
bit
medium
bodied
with
a
very
fine
and
mild
carbonation
a
fine
ale
and
highly
drinkable
the
taste
falls
a
little
short
subdued
maltiness
and
only
a
touch
of
the
spice
and
fruit
promised
by
the
smell
nothing
jumps
out
at
me
here
but
its
certainly
not
out
of
balance
lots
of
creaminess
but
the
head
is
not
at
full
as
some
the
bottle
disappears
between
the
3
of
us
but
one
sip
doesnt
beg
for
another
drinkability
this
is
a
good
beer
and
it
drinks
easily
still
its
not
great
and
its
certainly
not
very
interesting
it
lacks
complex
and
all
in
all
its
different
flavors
are
too
restrained
i
was
expecting
more
from
it
however
this
was
my
first
bière
de
garde
so
i
dont
have
many
reference
points
to
compare
it
with
but
i
was
expecting
something
in
the
line
of
a
belgian
saison
and
even
though
i
can
detect
some
small
similarities
this
is
far
from
a
saison
its
too
clean
too
restrained
and
anonymous
again
not
a
bad
beer
but
ill
probably
forget
about
it
in
a
while
d
this
is
my
best
biere
de
garde
experience
yet
this
could
be
my
new
really
hot
summer
day
beer
overall
very
good
biere
de
garde
i
will
certainly
have
more
of
this
750ml
bottle
served
in
my
gouden
carolus
chalice
poured
a
translucent
gold
with
an
orange
hue
half
inch
cap
quickly
dissipates
into
a
fairly
consistent
swirl
nose
was
grassy
and
minty
taste
was
wet
cardboard
grainy
and
grassy
mint
flavor
was
diminshed
mouthfeel
was
light
and
lively
easy
drinking
fairly
clean
and
a
wellhidden
abv
but
not
really
my
thing
crisp
carbonation
with
a
light
body
apparently
good
beer
in
14th
century
france
was
known
as
goudale
or
good
ale
even
though
this
particular
goudale
is
much
better
than
moyenale
mediocre
ale
im
not
sure
that
it
does
enough
to
earn
its
name
still
i
dont
regret
the
9
99
purchase
price
one
bit
pours
a
rich
golden
colour
with
a
huge
foamy
white
head
which
the
picture
does
show
rather
well
the
beer
is
also
quite
bubbly
sustaining
the
head
so
that
it
never
fully
disappears
the
nose
is
rather
hoppy
with
plenty
of
grassy
floral
notes
as
well
as
touches
of
over
ripe
bananas
and
cloves
without
realizing
it
i
was
drinking
a
wheat
beer
confirmed
by
checking
the
ingredients
in
my
frenchenglish
dictionary
having
an
abv
of
7
2
this
was
one
of
the
stronger
wheat
beers
i
have
had
however
it
was
very
smooth
and
the
alcohol
only
kicking
in
with
a
warming
glow
once
it
was
some
way
down
my
throat
d
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
it
was
easy
drinking
and
unique
d
unique
and
delicious
rugged
unrefined
belgian
complexity
while
still
maintaining
a
bright
fresh
profile
lacking
of
farmhouse
funkiness
not
that
farmhouse
funkiness
is
bad
as
of
now
any
future
beire
de
garde
that
i
buy
will
have
this
to
live
up
to
d
taste
likes
a
strong
kölsch
has
little
in
common
with
the
heavy
belgian
dubbles
and
trippels
despite
its
72
abv
tastes
like
a
pepped
up
good
summer
beer
overall
a
decent
enough
and
very
drinkable
biere
de
garde
definitely
worth
a
try
if
i
had
to
compare
this
to
something
it
would
be
an
american
blonde
ale
biere
de
garde
is
a
style
that
i
really
have
taken
a
shine
toi
just
wish
i
could
get
morethis
poured
into
a
oversized
wine

a

that
left
shotty

mild
phenols
in
the

along
with
some

and

real
complexity
to
this

i
gotta
sayfirst
that
mild
phenolic
clovelike
spice
comes
thru
along
with
some
ironmetallic
notes
with
a
nice
leafyherbal
finish
a
beer
with
good
complexity
and
it
feels
lighter
than
it
isvery
nice
d
this
is
a
nice
bier
de
garde
and
easy
to
drink
though
it
isnt
terribly
complex
a
more
interesting
malt
profile
could
make
this
a
great
beer
as
it
is
i
dont
feel
like
i
need
to
have
this
one
again
after
a
couple
of
bottles
ive
nicknamed
this
stuff
marteau
which
is
french
for
hammer
ive
had
lots
of
7
abv
beers
before
but
for
some
reason
this
hits
harder
than
others
in
the
same
range
very
tasty
brew
and
a
pretty
good
deal
at
only
5
99
a
750
this
is
only
my
second
attempt
at
a
biere
de
garde
but
this
style
is
starting
to
enter
the
tops
for
me
if
you
see
it
especially
at
the
price
i
got
it
for
go
for
it
however
if
la
divine
is
there
also
brewed
by
these
guys
it
is
superior
drinkability
is
really
pretty
good
simple
and
easy
drinking
the
abv
is
well
hidden
and
the
price
is
right
something
about
it
is
very
digestible
in
spite
of
the
strength
i
like
the
old
school
label
it
adds
to
the
whole
rustic
experience
a
pilsner
color
crisp
light
straw
very
musty
skunk
of
a
nose
with
a
consistent
head
nice
volume
throughout
skunky
funk
as
some
weird
barn
esters
in
there
fruitiness
not
sweet
constricting
hop
taste
little
malt
flavor
covered
by
herbal
aspects
and
hop
fruit
is
a
mystery
in
the
skunk
at
the
tip
of
the
palate
this
beer
is
waiting
for
dried
meat
and
a
sharper
feta
plus
the
750
cost
me
4
26
after
tax
cant
beat
that
a
good
beer
for
a
fantastic
price
i
mean
lets
make
no
mistake
this
is
an
ok
at
best
biere
de
garde
but
as
a
beer
it
offers
enough
complexity
to
keep
me
going
with
enough
drinkability
to
keep
me
drinking
and
the
price
i
mean
sure
i
could
get
a
better
beer
if
i
broke
into
the
8
range
and
could
get
a
substantially
better
beer
if
i
broke
into
the
12
range
but
i
gotta
say
if
i
were
to
price
this
beer
blind
i
would
have
placed
it
in
the
8
range
so
it
is
a
steal
for
the
price
d
comes
off
to
me
as
more
of
a
strong
moderatelyhopped
blonde
lager
than
a
biere
de
garde
that
said
it
is
rather
drinkable
and
enjoyable
just
not
really
what
i
was
looking
for
from
this
style
its
refreshing
and
tasty
which
makes
for
an
enjoyable
beer
but
ultimately
a
nonstandard
biere
de
garde
purchased
plaza
liquors
tucson
az
d
this
is
actually
a
quite
nice
brew
very
refreshing
but
be
careful
that
alc
content
can
sneak
up
on
you
a
good
ale
funny
enough
nice
beer
very
refreshing
during
summer
this
was
a
very
refreshing
beer
and
easily
drinkable
reasonably
priced
too
about
9
for
a
750
bottle
there
are
so
many
beers
out
there
ive
yet
to
try
so
it
might
be
a
while
before
i
revisit
this
one
but
it
was
an
enjoyable
beer
for
this
time
of
year
worth
a
try
if
you
come
across
it
d
refreshing
and
smart
but
not
so
much
rustic
well
look
what
i
found
at
marrikas
bierstube
i
knew
nothing
of
this
beer
but
after
examining
the
bottle
was
convinced
it
was
worth
a
shot
the
beer
pours
with
a
hazy
canary
yellow
color
some
yeast
floaties
and
a
soft
yet
spritzy
head
formation
that
retained
nicely
throughout
aromas
of
soft
pilsner
malts
lemons
among
more
citrus
fruits
apricots
pineapples
white
grapes
apples
and
pears
very
estery
needless
to
say
peppery
phenolics
give
a
depth
to
the
aroma
with
white
pepper
clove
and
ginger
a
subtle
grandmasattic
dusty
yeasty
somewhat
funky
reminds
me
that
we
definately
have
an
artisnal
belgian
on
our
hands
flavors
also
focus
on
the
fruits
while
following
up
on
the
spices
tartness
and
funky
flavors
from
the
wild
yeast
the
beer
never
slides
over
to
the
barnyard
character
that
the
style
can
sometimes
bring
but
they
are
not
as
clean
as
a
flying
dog
garde
dog
either
textures
are
light
creamy
warming
spicy
and
prickly
due
to
the
carbonation
finishes
with
a
fruity
estery
peppery
lingering
very
easy
and
enjoyable
to
drink
overall
a
nice
refreshing
french
ale
overall
this
is
a
very
tasty
beer
again
dont
let
the
other
reviews
fool
you
this
is
worth
buying
not
amazing
but
still
an
extremely
solid
offering
d
i
had
planned
on
finishing
the
750ml
bottle
but
its
looking
like
that
might
be
a
drink
for
tomorrow
its
a
rough
and
slightly
intense
brew
perhaps
im
just
illversed
in
biere
de
gardes
one
thing
this
does
have
in
spades
is
excellent
drinkability
it
practically
jumps
in
to
your
mouth
a
bit
pricey
though
for
half
the
price
i
will
get
the
hennepin
it
finishes
somewhat
sweet
and
malty
and
i
find
myself
wanting
another
sip
if
you
can
find
this
one
and
you
may
have
to
ask
around
i
would
give
it
a
shot
this
is
a
great
looking
brew
perfect
white
lacy
head
with
a
nice
clear
and
golden
body
aromas
are
arid
with
light
grassy
nodes
and
a
little
grainy
too
the
taste
is
more
than
on
par
it
has
a
sweet
bubble
gum
character
up
front
but
then
gets
countered
with
a
bitter
cooked
vegetable
like
finish
this
feels
pretty
clean
and
has
a
slight
alcoholic
warmness
to
it

for

try
it
drinkability
i
enjoyed
this
beer
a
good
ale
indeed
even
if
the
brewer
calls
it
a
topfermented
lager
the
alcohol
came
on
a
bit
strong
very
deceptive
finishes
with
a
tinge
of
alcohol
and
bitterness
the
flavor
is
rough
but
not
bad
just
right
for
the
style
i
suppose
its
a
big
beer
but
the
mouthfeel
remains
quite
light
and
dry
i
could
definitely
go
for
a
few
of
these
mouthfeel
was
sticky
but
not
sweet
and
lingering
a
bit
more
bubbles
wouldve
scored
it
somewhat
higher
served
from
a
750ml
bottle
this
beer
pours
clear
gold
with
a
hint
of
opaqueness
looking
rather
like
a
cross
between
a
pilsner
and
a
kolsch
it
leaves
a
bit
of
lacing
and
a
thin
head
the
smell
has
a
hint
of
banana
but
reminds
me
mostly
of
a
generic
crap
warmcountry
lager
frankly
the
taste
has
a
hint
of
malt
up
front
followed
by
a
pungent
hops
that
is
fragrent
but
not
bitter
it
does
have
a
very
smooth
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
nicely
carbonated
with
a
creamy
feel
to
it
not
too
shabby
really
its
drinkability
is
decent
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
it
masks
the
alcohol
well
but
the
finish
is
a
bit
too
floral
and
dry
to
sum
it
up
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
tried
in
france
which
is
to
say
its
like
the
sexiest
of
your
cousins
enjoyable
in
a
way
but
just
not
something
you
want
to
brag
that
youve
done
one
of
the
reasons
i
like
it
is
perhaps
its
stronger
flavor
its
full
flavor
also
does
a
great
job
quite
artistic
really
of
masking
the
alcohol
content
which
is
deceptively
strong
7
2
it
has
many
characteristics
of
a
good
continental
lager
even
though
it
is
biére
de
haute
fermentation
as
if
it
were
taking
the
flavor
to
a
new
level
beyond
what
is
possible
in
bottom
fermentation
this
style
seems
to
be
typical
of
many
microbrews

northern

nor
do
i
claim
that
the
french
are
experts
at
brewing
beer
still
though
lacking
in
the
big

earthy
bitterness
found

with

this
might
be
true
to
style
but
as
ive
never
had
this
type
of
beer
before
i
can
only
say
im
not
a
huge
fan
not
quite
what
i
would
expect
from
rr
but
this
one
could
have
had
some
age
as
they
are
not
distributed
here
still
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
this
is
one
of
the
better
beers
we
had
at
russian
river
that
isnt
already
famous
its
sort
of
like
a
saison
in
its
yeast
complexion
but
has
a
lot
of
body
and
isnt
quite
as
dry
there
is
a
really
neat
fruit
aspect
to
this
mango
and
green
grape
characteristics
that
dont
come
from
hops
i
suspect
a
high
level
of
wheat
in
the
grain
bill
there
is
some
weight
on
the
palate
but
it
drinks
pretty
easy
and
finishes
a
little
long
with
a
nice
grassy
hop
presence
i
wish
for
more
carbonation
it
seemed
a
little
flat
from
the
tap
not
flat
but
not
excited
either
its
a
rustic
beer
with
a
lot
of
layers
more
complex
than
perhaps
some
of
the
other
non
sours
at
russian
river
i
liked
this
one
a
lot
although
it
seems
more
suitable
for
spring
than
fall
o
havent
had
many
of
this
style
this
beer
was
a
cool
combination
of
old
world
malt
mixed
with
new
world
hops
with
sour
character
thrown
in
reviewed
from
notes
taken
on
3714
o
this
is
another
great
beer
general
rule
of
thumb
russian
river
beers
ending
in
tion
are
good
flavor
is
sweeter
than
i
expected
with
some
malty
roundness
and
a
phenolic
finish
a
tasty
drink
the
beer
is
amber
hued

that

the

taste
is

the

with
a
mild

this

has
a
good

overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
smells
better
than
it
tastes
in
my
opinion
o
belgiany
bright
and
crisp
with
subtle
layers
which
add
complexity
a
very
refreshing
brew
and
another
well
crafted
and
interesting

edition
ale
from
rr
o
a
really
fun
beer
to
try
this
hit
the
spot
on
the
100
degree
afternoon
this
brew
was
enjoyed
on
crisp
clean
and
refreshing
too
bad
it
doesnt
make
it
to
the
bottle
much
anymore
im
guessing
its
just
too
expensive
andor
maybe
wouldnt
sell
as
well
as
the
other
rr
regulars
another
big
tick
on
the
russian
river
tion
quest
that
i
started
once
i
started
drinking
craft
beer
ive
run
out
of
tion
beers
to
tick
here
so
if
you
have
one
i
have
not
ticked
hit
me
up
big
thanks
goes
out
to
bilbosnuts
for
procuring
this
growler
for
me
shared
by
myself
during
bross242s
sendoff
party
before
he
moves
will
miss
you
man
served
from
growler
into
a
mikkeller
taster
flute
poured
redorange
with
a
half
finger
white
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
slowly
maintained
excellent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
grain
wheat
earth
spice
and
fruit
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
fruit
spice
grain
wheat
and
earth
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
high
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
good
brew
i
have
really
enjoyed
most
of
the
brews
i
have
had
on
my
tion
quest
and
this
one
was
no
exception
to
this
trend
it
was
really
well
balanced
and
quite
complex
for
the
style
which
made
the
growler
quite
enjoyable
for
all
people
in
attendance
of
the
tasting
hope
i
get
to
experience
the
others
in
the
near
future
definitely
worth
the
try
if
you
get
the
chance
i
would
maybe
knock
the
overall
score
up
to
4
from
another
brewer
but
russian
river
has
a
few
beers
that
handily
destory
this
one
still
worth
a
try
o
i
dont
like
it
but
its
not
bad
not
recommended
wouldnt
have
again
solidly
in
style
it
reminds
me
of
some
of
the
classics
like
3
monts
it
does
end
up
being
a
little
harsh
on
the
finish
but
even
that
is
acceptable
for
a
bdg
that
criticism
is
probably
just
prejudice
on
my
part
this
is
just
a
great
beer
not
as
crazy
as
the
sours
but
perhaps
my
favorite
russian
river
belgianstyle
next
to
damnation
t
this
wasnt
a
bad
drink
at
all
faint
lemon
seed
and
biscuity
malt
flavors
with
a
faint
but
lingering
earthy
hop
bitterness
in
the
background
very
mild
but
pretty
tasty
overall
very
drinkable
and
pretty
enjoyable
if
im
eternally
damned
i
hope
its
for
drinking
something
a
little
more
interesting
than
this
not
bad
at
all
but
what
from
rr
isnt
dr
quite
drinkable
with
no
alcohol
coming
through
a
quality
brew
held
back
by
the
simplicity
of
its
flavour
profile
o
i
enjoyed
this
more
as
it
warmed
overall
vey
tasty
aged
a
bit
if
i
remember
correctly
i
like
it
with
a
bit
of
age
on
it
like
this
compared
to
fresh
d
easy
to
drink
and
very
tasty
cheers
interesting
belgian
yeast
profile
it
is
sufficient
and
does
not
take
over
the
beer
good
balance
of
flavors
o
an
interesting
beer
for
sure
not
a
style
i
actively
seek
but
was
happy
to
try
would
recommend
this
and
try
it
again
nutty
malty

some
specific
walnut

stemming
from

do
play
a
minor
role
creamy
and
mild

an
easygoing

beer
thats
well
put
together
and
not
overdriven
by

didnt
pick
up
on
any

some

did

would
like
to

what

very

nicely

quite
nice
worth
having
vinnie
cilurzo
one
of
very
few
brewers
whose
name
not
only
warrants
being
dropped
in
these
reviews
but
is
also
one
of
the
few
that
can
be
readily
recognized
by
the
average
craft
beer
drinker
brews
belgian
ales
like
he
was
born
a
belgian
himself
or
in
this
case
french
perdition
is
not
a
bad
beer
to
be
stuck
with
forever
hell
i
wish
i
had
it
on
hand
at
all
times
m
medium
body
moderate
carbonation
d
very
drinkable
the
sweetness
provided
from
the
fruit
flavors
blend
really
nicely
with
the
rest
of
the
flavors
there
is
also
a
really
nice
dryness
throughout
the
beer
for
a
brewery
well
known
for
its
hops
and
sours
this
one
seems
like
a
malgamation
of
everything
else
besides
those
two
things
they
are
famous
for
hugely
quaffable
and
a
nice
beer
to
pair
with
food
light
on
the
palate
nice
and
fruity
with
just
enough
yeast
notes
to
provide
some
contrast
a
nice
offering
overall
it
stood
well
on
its
own
but
would
be
fantastic
with
a
meal
thanks
so
much
to
schmittymack
for
pulling
this
one
out
of
the
cellar
friday
night
poured
a
nice
light
brown
color
with
a
small
ecru
head
aromas
of
yeast
spices
apple
skins
and
caramel
malt
medium
bodied
drinkable
slightly
musty
with
flavors
of
belgian
yeast
spices
and
sweet
fruit
while
perdition
isnt
a
headline
grabber
like
other
beers
in
the
tion
series
it
is
a
relaxed
beer
good
for
any
occasion
d
solid
biere
de
garde
not
knowing
the
style
i
thought
it
was
some
hybrid
of
a
belgian
dark
ale
but
i
get
it
now
knowing
the
style
well
done
the
thing
that
strikes
me
is
that
this
beer
has
a
really
long
finish
this
is
not
the
same
as
a
really
bitter
beer
where
the
bitterness
sticks
on
your
pallet
this
beer
has
length
and
complexity
in
the
same
way
a
well
made
wine
does
a
really
nice
beer
to
sip
and
take
your
time
with
the
kicker
is
that
this
beer
was
3
25
during
happy
hour
cant
beat
that
had
this
on
tap
at
the
russian
river
brewpub
in
santa
rosa
pours
a
copper
brown
colour
with
thick
white
head
and
huge
amounts
of
lacing
on
the
glass
smells
quite
spicy
almost
like
a
saison
with
lots
of
belgian
yeast
this
is
quite
balanced
with
bitternes
and
the
tart
yeastiness
big
carbonation
level
this
was
my
first
bière
de
garde
so
11
styles
left
to
go
for
me
now
the
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
were
great
as
are
most
things
rr
puts
out
it
was
just
lacked
something
distinct
separating
it
from
other
saisons
that
i
could
say
that
would
truly
make
this
beer
exceedingly
above
avg
for
the
style
i
didnt
get
any
particular
fruity
notes
at
all
which
i
saw
someone
mention
in
a
review
only
the
typical
floral
spicy
nose
of
a
typical
saison
from
say
dupont
like
say
fuego
del
otono
had
this
wonderful
chestnut
flavor
to
it
that
really
made
it
stick
out
from
the
others
of
the
style
was
just
wishing
this
had
more
identity
to
it
d
this
was
the
last
of
four
others
i
had
in
one
sitting
but
could
easily
drink
a
few
in
one
sitting
no
problem
tough
to
have
a
lot
of
this
guy
but
still
enjoyable
d
this
took
me
longer
to
work
through
than
supplication
it
drank
like
a
meal
to
some
extent
and
lacked
sufficient
depth
to
make
me
want
more
this
was
a
good
saison
the
flavor
was
fun
and
unique
which
keeps
it
very
drinkable
d
highly
drinkable
and
delicious
a
very
unique
and
unusual
beer
in
a
style
of
its
own
d
im
not
always
the
biggest
fan
of
biere
de
garde
some
just
seem
to
be
very
poorly
done
but
like
most
other
russian
river
beers
i
liked
this
nice
flavors
and
yeast
notes
solid
all
around
d
drinkability
is
very
high
something
about
perdition
just
makes
it
disappear
too
quick
i
shared
a
750
ml
bottle
but
could
and
would
easily
tackle
one
by
myself
the
nutty
flavor
really
stands
out
with
this
particular
offering
from
russian
river
its
not
the
best
ive
had
from
them
but
still
very
solid
nonetheless
jd
d
very
drinkable
bier
de
garde
and
made
me
want
more
after
5ozs
of
it
good
offering
from
rr
d
about
as
easy
drinking
as
it
gets
not
exceptionally
complex
or
dynamic
but
not
every
beer
need
be
russian
river
brewing
has
an
interesting
creation
in
perdition
im
not
madly
in
love
with
biere
de
gardes
and
im
still
not
this
ones
okay
frankly
its
probably
my
least
favorite
russian
river
beer
that
ive
tried
its
good
but
its
not
something
im
head
over
heels
about
theres
nothing
about
it
thats
very
exciting
maybe
i
sat
on
the
bottle
too
long
good
beer
nonetheless
definitely
recommended
if
you
have
the
opportunity
overall
not
really
what
i
had
expected
a
little
bit
more
yeast
character
or
spiciness
mightve
been
nice
and
alleviated
some
of
the
sweetness
im
glad
to
have
tried
it
and
though
this
was
clearly
well
made
there
is
nothing
too
distinctive
or
assertive
about
it
and
might
be
one
of
my
least
favorite
rr
beers
to
date
d
this
is
classified
as
a
biere
de
garde
but
seems
to
fall
into
the
belgian
pale
ale
category
a
bit
better
overall
a
very
good
sessionable
ale
that
i
would
drink
regularly
if
i
had
access
dark
copperamber
color
with
a
creamy
off
white
head
that
has
low
retention
and
spotty
lacing
spicy
earthy
musty
caramel
malt
aroma
with
some
belgian
yeast
body
is
very
smooth
medium
body
carbonation
is
on
lighter
side
flavor
is
similar
to
aroma
and
overall
is
a
little
sweeter
than
expected
for
a
biere
de
garde
i
guess
thats
why
its
a
biere
de
sonoma
not
bad
not
exceptional
easy
drinking
and
unique
for
the
style
notes
decent
beer
but
not
super
captivating
when
at
the
brewery
id
recommend
trying
one
of
their
much
more
exceptional
beers
personally
an
easy
drinker
but
a
touch
sweet
and
not
terribly
interesting
so
i
had
no
desire
to
order
another
glass
right
away
slightly
earthy
yet
sweet
medium
body
with
a
buteer
silk
mouthfeel
very
subtle
hops
and
some
nice
light
crisp
fruit
lotsof
apple
and
pear
and
possibly
some
grape
with
a
nice
maltiness
underneath
and
a
spicy
slightly
dry
finish
i
have
this
maybe
once
or
twice
a
year
at
rr
it
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
that
is
good
for
someone
trying
to
delve
into
various
belgianfrench
styles
i
find
the
sweetness
limits
it
to
one
glass
but
it
is
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
ipas
and
sours
draught
at
the
brewpub
amber
with
a
fine
white
head
malty
caramel
and
strong
bubblegum
aroma
the
flavor
is
spicy
and
hoppy
with
caramel
sweetness
bubblegum
earthy
spice
and
a
bitter
finish
mediumlight
bodied
and
smoothly
carbonated
the
spice
and
bubblegum
are
just
a
bit
too
much
drinkability
the
best
things
about
this
beer
is
the
taste
and
how
drinkable
it
is
i
could
drink
this
all
day
i
almost
wish
i
didnt
share
it
with
my
3
friends
drinkability
a
bit
to
similar
to
a
pale
ale
for
me
a
decent
beer
but
not
my
favorite
rr
d
quite
drinkable
a
very
interesting
beerbig
fan
of
this
one
especially
coming
from
a
style
im
not
always
particularly
fond
of
dnot
really
crazy
about
this
one
but
needless
to
say
it
is
still
a
well
crafted
and
good
brew
simply
doesnt
have
the
attributes
that
i
enjoy
try
this
one
if
you
get
a
chance
cheers
drinkability
pretty
high
was
telling
myself
not
to
quaff
this
down
which
was
hard
to
do
after
a
long
day
at
ls
it
is
hard
to
be
patient
with
beers
but
im
glad
i
was
not
my
favorite
from
rr
but
im
glad
i
tried
it
i
followed
this
with
a
pte
and
good
god
i
never
get
sick
of
that
i
downright
love
this
style
which
is
hard
to
find
but
sooo
good
this
is
one
of
the
better
d
very
unique
beer
from
russian
river
that
is
kind
of
like
a
biere
de
garde
with
a
funky
twist
lots
of
intertwining
flavors
weave
together
to
create
a
very
complex
brew
poured
a
deep
red
body
with

and
taste
is
some
dark
fruit
sweet
malt
and
caramel

rr
has
captured
the
essence
of
the
style
and
yet
made
it
their
own
i
cant
really
find
any
faults
in
this
beer
its
not
too
over
the
top
but
it
has
enough
flavors
and
character
to
keep
it
interesting
i
love
you
russian
river
those
rr
guys
make
very
good
beers
and
really
craft
them
this
was
certainly
not
one
of
my
favorites
but
its
still
very
wellmade
i
cant
say
that
ive
tried
many
biere
de
gardes
but
this
is
certainly
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
tried
to
date
thanks
robert
overall
this
is
a
complex
beer
and
probably
the
best
biere
de
garde
ive
had
even
though
technically
its
a
bier
de
sonoma
certainly
worth
a
shot
very
well
executed
eminently
drinkable
while
being
unique
and
complex
enough
to
keep
you
interested
d
meh
this
didnt
stand
out
it
still
may
have
been
too
cold
but
i
thought
waiting
30
minutes
was
reasonable
anyway
it
didnt
strike
me
as
a
very
complicated
or
appealing
flavor
profile
poured
a
corked
and
caged
750ml
into

this
beer

massive
rocky
creamy
beige
head
that
leaves
some
serious
crazy
lacing
as
the
beer
disappears
from
my
glass
perdition
pours
a
beautiful
beer
the
head
and
lace
is
some
of
the
best
i
have
ever
seen
many
props
to
russian
river
the
aroma
is
rather
blunt
toasted
bread
raisins
pear
apple
and
just
a
bit
of
belgian
yeast
spice
the
flavor
is
much
more
mellow
then
the
nose
would
have
you
think
nothing
is
very
prevalent
brown
sugar
pear
and
a
bit
of
raisin
the
flavor
is
not
very
complex
but
it
is
very
satisfying
the
mouthfeel
is
probably
the
weakest
link
in
my
mind
of
this
beer
while
it
looks
to
be
decently
malty
is
comes
across
as
watery
thin
this
really
surprised
and
slightly
disappointed
me
while
i
do
have
my
issues
i
find
this
to
be
a
good
beer
and
i
love
seeing
breweries
like
russian
river
do
best
experiment
without
care
to
traditional
styles
a
nice
and
interesting
beer
highly
drinkable
and
a
good
food
match
i
would
have
a
few
more
home
if
i
could
d
a
nice
beer
good
for
a
few
but
probably
not
much
more
than
that
thank
you
grey
lodge
for
getting
this
and
rr
for
sending
it
oh
yeah
and
all
the
intermediates
in
between

of

very
good
beer
i
could
drink
tons
of
this
my
mouth
has
been
refreshed
rejuvenated
and
relaxed
by
sipping
upon
this
rare
ale
surely
my
cohort
chris
dotson
deserves
an
evening
at
the
finest
nunnery
in
christendom
for
bringing
such
to
me
d
good
but
probably
couldnt
drink
a
750
on
my
own
drinkability
a
really
unusual
but
very
drinkable
beer
this
beer
is
certainly
really
drinkable
its
extremely
mild
and
fairly
well
balanced
not
as
good
as
most
of
the
other
russian
river
stuff
i
have
tried
though
medium
bodied
with
subtle
carbonation
it
has
a
smooth
feel
to
it
altogether
this
is
a
pretty
pleasant
beer
which
is
obviously
well
crafted
and
complex
if
that
slightest
touch
of
solvent
wasnt
there
it
would
be
fantastic
d
overall
its
pretty
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
d
not
bad
but
definitely
not
even
close
to
the
best
of
russian
rivers
offerings
d
good
will
probably
get
it
again
notes
for
review
150
i
reached
in
the
fridge
and
this
is
what
i
found
i
had
high
expectations
and
this
one
pulled
through
a
bit
thin
not
my
fave
from
russian
river
d
this
is
ok
although
maybe
a
bit
boring
especially
for
rr
in
the
end
it
just
tasted
like
an
amber
ale
with
toasted
malt
i
dont
really
get
any
spices
or
belgian
character
at
all
drinkability
is
high
because
its
pretty
mellow
and
low
in
alcohol
maybe
it
lost
some
flavor
in
the
4
months
since
i
got
it
did
not
mean
to
let
it
sit
for
this
long
i
remember
it
being
pretty
good
when
i
got
it
at
fo
but
in
the
bottle
im
not
really
that
impressed
i
would
certainly
drink
this
beer
if
i
were
in
the
mood
for
something
mellow
but
considering
how
hard
it
is
to
find
in
socal
there
are
plenty
of
other
options
perdition
is
a
good
looking
dark
golden
belgian
with
a
foamy
head
the
beer
smells
earthy
and
a
bit
yeasty
its
a
pleasant
belgian
aroma
the
taste
is
complex
and
unique
in
my
experience
its
a
bit
like
a
sweet
farmhouse
ale
its
fruity
with
a
lot
of
earthiness
there
are
hops
but
rr
has
toned
down
their
normal
flavors
well
to
allow
for
a
more
complex
more
belgian
character
its
a
very
drinkable
beer
with
a
smooth
feel
the
taste
has
lightly
stewed
fruit
with
light
toasted
grain
caramelized
fruit
and
hints
of
bread
wine
and
black
pepper
the
latter
is
especially
noticeable
in
the
dryish
finish
overall
its
slightly
on
the
dry
side
but
not
too
much
and
it
has
mild
sweetness
and
stops
just
short
of
being
bitter
its
smooth
but
has
more
bite
than
redemption

overall
a
solid
beer
again
from
rr
glad
i
got
to
try
it
finally
but
if
i
had
a
range
of
rrs
in
front
of
me
there
are
several
that
id
reach
for
first
would
like
to
try
on
tap
though
a
good
beer
but
somewhat
forgettable
tastes
phenolic
smokey
mild
phenols
on
the
top
of
the
mouth
are
dry
in
a
decent
struggle
with
malt
sweet
light
chocolate
comes
in
late
finish
wins
out
dry
partly
due
to
the
fine
carbonation
cleaning
the
papillae
on
the
tongue
mdlight
and
silky
yet
leaves
the
mouth
clean
of
liquid
flavors
hang
around
in
the
aftertaste
decent
but
too
dry
for
me
pours
a
dark
brown
in
color
there
are
some
ruby
highlights
and
a
very
good
amount
of
head
on
the
pour
smell
is
some
dark
fruit
lots
of
belgian
yeast
and
then
some
citrusy
hop
finish
on
the
end
you
get
even
more
of
the
light
citrusy
fruit
flavor
in
the
taste
i
wasnt
expecting
that
at
all
from
the
color
of
the
beer
decent
beer
but
many
more
i
would
take
over
this
deep
amber
colored
beer
with
an
authentic
belgian
foam
large
fluffy
head
lasts
really
well
dry
fruity
nose
peppery
yeasty
dank
and
authentic
aroma
spicy
hop
flavors
with
pepper
and
spice
herblike
hops
with
tealike
flavors
really
nice
authentic
beer
it
pours
up
a
darker
amber
color
the
nose
is
a
nice
blend
of
yeasty
herbal
and
floral
aromas
the
taste
is
malty
dry
chocolatey
even
this
beer
just
makes
sense
may
i
have
another
overall
this
was
very
interesting
and
a
very
solid
offering
i
thought
it
was
a
wonderful
addition
to
their
lineup
and
really
just
a
solid
beer
all
around
i
will
be
looking
for
this
one
again
for
sure
this
was
phenomenal
very
complex
and
tasty
pours
a
stunning
deep
ruby
with
a
rocky
two
finger
offwhite
head
that
falls
to
a
soft
layer
of
bubbles
sporadic
lacing
sticks
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
with
no
intentions
of
letting
go
smell
is
much
more
than
i
was
hoping
for
apples
grapes
and
pears
tickle
the
nose
with
an
earthy
undertone
some
caramel
freshly
brewed
lemon
tea
and
sweet
honey
very
pleasant
aroma
an
absolute
joy
to
sniff
taste
begins
with
more
of
the
previous
mentioned
earthiness
followed
by
sweet
toffee
and
white
grapes
midway
more
sweetness
emerges
with
green
apples
and
apricot
followed
by
caramel
and
butterscotch
aftertaste
is
slightly
floral
and
fairly
dry
with
a
hint
of
cinnamon
the
best
part
of
the
flavor
to
me
anyway
is
the
lack
of
belgian
yeast
on
the
tongue
medium
body
with
a
chewy
and
prickly
feel
from
the
high
carbonation
could
be
smoother
but
still
flows
well
between
the
cheeks
scary
thing
this
is
a
borderline
session
beer
to
me
if
i
could
get
my
hands
on
this
on
a
regular
basis
it
would
be
a
constant
in
my
fridge
perfect
year
round
beer
why
this
beer
doesnt
get
more
recognition
is
beyond
me
i
understand
russian
river
makes
some
of
the
best
beers
in
the
country
but
this
may
be
one
of
my
favorites
by
vinnie
next
to
supplication
a
permanent
want
list
brew
for
me
1st
quite
excited
to
try
this
with
a
big
turnout
is
quite
dry
yet
a
bit
spunky
is
a
delicious
brew
indeed
pours
a
golden
somewhat
brown
colour
with
a
good
headfoam
has
some
fun
yeast
floaties
an
enjoyable
brew
that
shows
great
promise
on
future
rr
brews
d
has
some
tasty
qualities
toasted
grainy
sweet
nuttiness
enough
hoppy
floralness
i
think
this
one
is
still
fresh
enough
but
id
love
to
have
one
at
its
newest
thanks
to
andy
for
this
good
russian
river
treat
overall
this
was
an
enjoyable
beer
that
i
wish
i
had
more
of
this
beer
reminds
me
of
a
breezy
fall
day
back
in
the
midwest
where
the
leaves
have
all
but
changed
colours
the
more
of
this
bottle
i
sip
on
the
more
i
find
myself
enjoying
it
this
is
exactly
what
i
hope
for
from
a
belgian
style
beer
decent
complexity
not
too
intense
easy
to
drink
i
just
wish
i
had
more
pours
a
lightly
hazed
orangelight
brown
some
chunkies
in
there
thin
off
white
head
forms
drops
some
lace
spots
on
the
way
down
thing
collar
around
the
glass
smell
is
very
fresh
and
lemony
citrus
fruits
tangerine
wheatbread
bit
of
spice
with
some
tartness
taste
is
honey
some

oranges
light

some
toast
and
wood
spices
and
sour
fruit
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
with
low
silky
carbonation
i
found
this
one
easy
drinking
in
the
hot
weather
thanks
jan
a
very
drinkable
belgian
wo
knowswhat
to
expect
from
rr
but
it
was
easy
drinking
some
sourness
yes
but
ive
had
more
sour
from
them
spicy
saison
charcter
medium
brown
with
a
big
head
and
lacey
great
mouthfeel
balanced
malt
and
bitterness
the
spice
andthe
sour
element
d
very
drinkable
for
its
weight
taste
mouthfeel
less
intense
than
the
nose
suggests
probably
a
good
thing
fruity
spicy
and
toasty
with
an
earthy
backbone
mediumbodied
the
finish
is
earthy
and
dry
with
mild
bitterness
easy
to
put
down
but
not
one
of
rrs
more
outstanding
beers
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
more
refreshing
side
with
lots
of
fast
moving
carbonation
that
rushes
across
the
palate
with
each
sip
a
pretty
refreshing
brew
the
only
complaint
i
have
is
the
carbonation
gets
to
be
a
bit
much
for
me
overall
another
solid
tasty
brew
from
russian
river
i
hope
to
be
able
to
sample
this
again
someday
d
very
drinkable
like
pretty
much
everything
russian
river
brews
i
was
very
luck
to
get
some
of
this
and
hope
to
get
some
more
in
the
near
future
definitely
worth
a
try
decent
biere
de
garde
overall
certainly
not
my
favorite
rr
offering
but
a
solid
effort
worth
a
try

thanks
my

abv
on
the
label
this
is
already
a
year
or
so
old
according
to
the
rr

log
so
this
should
give
me
a
good
idea
of
whether
or
not
to
age
my
other
bottle
batch
003
nice
rubyred
and
brown
mixture
with
a
nice
ring
of
bubbles
and
a
thin
white
film
it
looks
good
the
first
whiff
is
a
metallic
earthy
smell
that
i
also
picked
up
from
redemption
just
like
redemption
the
mineral
aroma
fades
as
it
warms
and
leaves
behind
a
very
fruity
juiciness
it
almost
like
cutting
open
a
lemon
or
watermelon
but
not
exactly
the
funny
thing
is
that
while
it
is
not
a
strong
aroma
it
begs
you
to
take
one
whiff
after
another
very
cool
the
flavor
is
bready
malty
spicy
some
hops
i
think
and
maybe
citrus
the
thing
i
like
about
this
beer
is
that
the
aroma
and
flavor
are
very
good
yet
very
subtle
it
really
begs
you
to
think
about
what
you
are
drinking
there
is
also
an
odd
flavor
that
makes
me
think
of
authentic
belgians
as
opposed
to
craft
belgianstyle
beers
maybe
it
is
rrs
yeast
because
redemption
gave
me
the
same
feeling
in
any
case
definitely
let
this
warm
up
and
you
will
be
rewarded
drinkability
is
great
doesnt
have
the
funk
or
depth
of
some
russian
river
brews
but
its
a
solid
and
very
enjoyable
beer
a
slightly
reddish
colabrown
with
a
loosetextured
offwhite
foam
that
recedes
over
23
minutes
to
a
thin
coating
on
the
surface
the
nose
is
very
fresh
and
zesty
sassafras
clove
tangerine
and
nutmeg
estery
belgian
yeast
flavors
tangy
candied
citrus
within
a
mellow
overall
taste
profile
like
nutty
banana
bread
the
taste
itself
doesnt
reveal
much
bitterness
at
all
but
theres
just
enough
hop
edge
to
make
the
finish
crisp
and
slightly
lingering
the
carbonation
is
fairly
low
and
has
a
sort
of
tingly
sodalike
feel
the
body
is
quite
light
which
feels
somewhat
surprising
given
the
maltyspicy
range
of
its
aromas
and
tastes
it
seems
sacrilegious
to
say
so
since
this
is
really
a
nice
beer
but
if
dr
pepper
tasted
really
really
good
it
might
be
something
like
this
they
call
this
biere
de
sonoma
to
indicate
its
sort
of
a
stylistic
experiment
and
while
i
wouldnt
yearn
to
have
this
every
day
like
pretty
much
everything
ive
tried
from
russian
river
it
is
an
interesting
experience
and
well
worth
a
try
d
glad
i
picked
up
a
bottle
of
this
d
i
like
this
beer
it
is
very
refreshing
with
a
nice
spicy
peppery
flavor
to
match
well
with
food
another
rr
success
like
the
kool
aid
guy
says
oh
yeah
d
very
drinkable
i
was
happy
to
finish
the
bottle
i
could
easily
put
down
a
few
pints
in
one
sitting
i
wont
go
seeking
this
beer
out
but
id
be
more
than
happy
to
buy
it
again
if
i
see
it
on
the
shelf
copper
pour
with
beige
head
smell
is
very
light
very
light
funk
maltiness
and
some
belgian
yeast
taste
is
very
mild
as
well
with
similar
lightly
fruity
maltiness
and
and
some
drying
dusty
and
chalky
funk
in
the
finish
but
lightly
so
not
bad
and
pretty
drinkable
i
love
the
irony
in
choosing
a
name
that
means
eternal
damnation
for
a
beer
that
is
probably
ontap
in
heaven
at
this
very
moment
if
it
isnt
it
should
be
perdition
is
a
masterpiece
that
deserves
to
be
brewed
on
a
regular
basis
outstanding
finishes
with
warming
alcohol
lingering
fruity
dryness
and
char
dust
dry
tannic
impression
subtle
herbal
and
woody
flavor
with
a
bit
of
sugar
before
the
bittering
finish
overall
this
beer
was
decent
but
not
my
favorite
i
would
drink
it
again
but
only
if
there
was
not
compunction
on
tap
d
well
russian
river
continues
to
push
the
boundaries
of
what
american
brewers
are
brewing
i
enjoyed
this
attempt
as
well
its
light
and
refreshing
very
tasty
and
very
interesting
this
is
a
nice
enough
beer
if
nothing
particularly
outstanding
or
special
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
drink
it
but
theres
simply
nothing
wrong
or
bad
about
this
beer
cheers
as
usual
rr
does
a
great
job
of
emulating
the
perfect
belgian
mouthfeel
quite
easy
to
drink
the
bottom
line
here
is
that
this
beer
taste
wonderful
but
lacks
sorely
in
carbonation
it
just
didnt
have
a
crisp
feel
like
other
biere
de
gardes
or
any
other
pale
belgians
for
that
matter
the
flavor
actually
reminds
me
of
piraat
with
a
sweet
bready
malt
and
herbal
and
subtle
citrus
rind
hops
drinkability
another
home
run
from
russian
river
their
big
bottle
series
has
yet
to
let
me
down
highly
recommended
a
beer
flavor
boasts
rich
dark
fruits
light
hops
and
a
distinct
element
of
freshly
cut
wood
though
not
smoky
cheers
perditions
appearance
is
stunning
body
is
a
browned
cranberry
with
rich
reddish
hues
deep
and
inviting
lace
is
ample
and
lasting
butter
colored
head
mildly
hazy
aroma
is
not
particularly
exciting
fitting
for
a
biere
de
garde
there
is
a
light
and
rather
generic
fruitiness
with
hints
of
pepper
flavor
is
kind
of
a
biscuity
english
brown
meets
belgian
fruity
yeast
with
a
little
spice
sort
of
concoction
again
not
terribly
dramatic
light
berry
and
apple
flavors
barely
discernable
from
just
a
generic
fruity
yeast
flavor
along
with
a
touch
of
biscuit
and
hint
of
spice
is
all
i
get
out
of
it
very
much
a
biere
de
garde
a
style
i
just
dont
care
for
drinkableyes
is
the
body
nice
certainly

light
to
medium
smooth
balanced
and
with
great
carbonation
still
this
is
not
for
me
i
would
pass
it
up
for
the
many
more
interesting
rrs
in
the
future
soft
and
smooth
mouthfeel
with
mediumhigh
carbonation
that
leaves
the
clean
and
refreshed
balanced
and
delicious
make
this
highly
drinkable
well
worth
sacrificing
one
growler
fill
of
pliny
the
taste
was
excellent
lots
of
caramel
especially
towards
the
end
of
the
glass
belgian
yeastiness
was
pretty
low
almost
hard
to
detect
that
it
was
a
belgian
style
beer
mouthfeel
was
pretty
good
though
maybe
tad
too
prickly
with
the
carbonation
but
this
beer
could
be
drank
all
day
absolutely
glorious
beer
notes
probably
the
best
biere
de
garde
ive
yet
to
get
my
hands
on
my
wife
brought
this
back
from
the
brewery
and
it
lost
its
seal
straight
to
the
freezer
and
a
half
hour
later
this
was
near
perfection
and
a
great
start
to
a
friday
night
thanks
vinnie
this
is
really
the
quintessential
quaffing
brew
i
am
really
enjoying
my
glass
of
this
brew
and
i
am
wishing
that
i
had
easy
access
to
this
on
a
regular
basis
the
stand
out
for
me
is
how
well
integrated
and
layered
the
flavors
are
here
nothing
screams
at
you
here
but
still
it
is
a
very
interesting
brew
without
taking
away
from
this
being
such
an
easy
drinking
beer
fit
for
a
happy
afternoon
session
among
friends

4
oz
750
ml
tall
straight
brown
winestyle
bottle
corked
and
caged
a
fine
example
of
the
style
worth
a
try
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
i
enjoyed
a
glass
of
this
and
my
girlfriend
had
2
certainly
worth
ordering
appeared
a
rust
color
with
a
nice
big
head
that
left
behind
tremendous
lacing
translucent
with
a
thin
film
covering
the
surface
aromas
of
malt
dark
fruit
heavy
cream
and
burnt
wood
the
taste
was
filled
with
juicy
fruit
flavors
quite
dry
and
yet
slightly
creamy
in
my
mouth
malt
flavors
seem
to
keep
the
hops
in
check
throughout
slightly
sour
finish
i
liked
this
beer
and
i
can
see
it
pairing
very
nicely
with
an
assortment
of
spicefilled
dishes
drinkability
overall
i
found
perdition
to
hide
its
alcohol
well
and
have
some
pleasing
fruitlike
complexity
along
with
some
yeastdriven
sourness
which
created
a
nice
bready
backbone
however
its
astringency
kept
me
from
wanting
to
have
more
than
a
glass
this
was
my
first
biere
de
garde
i
found
it
to
be
similar
to
other
styles
i
have
had
in
the
past
this
was
quite
drinkable
and
i
may
need
to
venture
further
into
the
style
it
poured
a
copper
color
with
a
slight
reddish
hue
and
displayed
moderate
carbonation
while
retaining
a
nice
head
with
smells
of
a
wonderful
light
hop
aroma
and
a
essence
of
spices
taste
is
of
gumball
bread
light
spices
not
over
done
could
drink
this
beer
all
night
long
taste
easy
to
drink
even
though
it
had
some
vineous
character
it
was
rather
light
bodied
in
mouthfeel
but
still
tasted
malty
sounds
vague
i
know
but
bières
de
garde
are
a
little
off
the
wall
like
this
sometimes
especially
this
one
who
totally
had
a
west
coast
feel
to
it
it
had
a
pleasing
citrusy
finish
though
another
winner
for
rr
in
my
book
taking
a
hard
style
to
pin
down
and
giving
it
their
own
personnal
touch
d
overall
this
beer
is
very
nice
lots
of
nice
flavors
mingling
as
one
im
a
huge
fan
or
russian
river
probably
my
favorite
brewery
maybe
my
expectations
are
to
high
im
not
sure
this
beer
just
seemed
plain
to
me
its
well
balanced
and
drinkable
but
just
doesnt
stand
out
very
forgettable
its
pours
a
dark
copper
color
opaque
a
small
head
touching
the
glass
the
beer
seems
a
little
bit
too
cold
the
aroma
is
of
spice
cinnamon
and
clove
and
some
mustiness
toasted
malts
come
through
on
the
palate
followed
by
a
strong
yeast
it
goes
well
with
fathers
offices
incredibly
delicious
sweet
potato
fries
the
smell
is
good
nice
floral
hops
dominate
the
nose
also
a
sweet
barley
malt
accompanyied
by
some
interesting
sugars
and
spices
the
taste
is
just
as
good
but
the
hops
are
accentuated
and
produce
a
nice
crisp
dry
and
deliciously
bitter
finish
very
drinkable
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
for
what
it
is
but
i
still
havent
fed
my
longing
for
the
plinys
or
one
of
the
sour
beers
very
smooth
and
very
easy
to
drink
mouth
chocolate
warm
breath
cinnamon
candy
like
flavors
excellent
mouthfeel
this
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
i
wish
i
could
find
it
in
san
francisco
the
body
is
more
of
a
light
feeling
then
mid
for
style
i
would
have
liked
more
fruitiness
and
less
yeasty
aftertaste
but
still
and
enjoyable
taste
mouthfeeldrinkability
lightweight
and
foamy
a
little
too
quick
to
settle
and
disperse
in
the
mouth
fortunately
later
in
the
tasting
the
body
improves
and
with
the
yeast
addition
it
gets
even
better
easy
drinking
just
not
overly
interesting
the
flavor
was
mostly
caramel
and
malt
the
mouthfeel
was
good
due
to
high
carbonation
strange
that
the
head
was
thin
with
so
much
fizz
from
my
notes
on
recent
trip
poured
into
a
sampling
glass
arrived
a
nice
copper
color
without
a
head
with
bits
of
lacing
here
and
there
aroma
is
matly
with
grains
and
a
spicy
and
yeasty
presense
too
taste
is
like
aroma
the
malts
up
front
and
spices
right
behind
finishes
pretty
nice
a
good
beer
and
one
for
the
growler
what
a
pilgrimage
i
can
only
hope
i
make
it
back
overall
i
noted
that
on
the
chalkboard
behind
the
bar
at
russian
river
that
this
was
listed
as
a
bier
de
sonoma
nice
description
drinkability
tasty
for
sure
and
a
easy
drinker
still
trying
to
think
of
a
good
food
pairing
for
this
another
beer
i
was
fortunate
enough
to
try
recently
at
the
source
in
santa
rosa
it
was
called
a
biere
de
gard
on
their
board
a
belgian
pale
on
this
site
to
me
it
seemed
a
saison
who
cares
its
a
damn
fine
beer
it
poured
a
deep
cloudy
amber
not
much
head
champagne
carbonation
fruity
nose
pears
green
apple
a
bit
of
spice
deep
rich

more

very

pours
a
cherry
red
body
witha
pinkish
white
head
good
retention
some
dark
fruit
sweet
malt
and
caramel
in
the
nose
medium
bodied
great
drinkability
and
sweet
quite
a
refreshing
ale
some
cherry
and
raspberry
flavours
some
phenols
too
very
well
made
brew
recommended
in
the
mouth
theres
a
significant
impression
of
dryness
but
nonetheless
the
beer
also
feels
very
bready
and
well
chewy
dry
yet
chewy
big
biscuit
flavor
a
yeasty
spicy
hoppy
biscuit
the
hopping
is
quite
apparent
and
works
far
better
than
i
would
have
expected
weird
but
satisfying
oh
so
satisfying
bready
yet
crisp
and
dry
i
wish
such
wonderful
fresh
belgianstyle
session
ales
were
more
readily
available
probably
my
favorite
of
the
tions
so
far
this
seems
to
be
rrs
version
of
a
flemish
daily
single
beer
like
antwerpens
dekoninck
or
something
to
that
effect
the
colour
is
a
kind
of
midorangeamber
hue
with
some
darker
edges
and
a
nice
head
of
mostly
pure
white
foam
the
aromas
are
spicy
belgian
leafy
hops
and
sweet
biscuity
candylike
malts
the
spiciness
of
this
brew
is
really
nice
and
many
spices
come
to
mind
whilst
sipping
this
great
sessionthemed
libation
taste
is
doughy
and
spicy
with
some
nice
hop
flavors
as
well
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
bodied
and
drinkability
is
very
good
a
very
good
belgian
sessionstyled
sipper
silky
smooth
entry
with
an
earthy
maltiness
which
slowly
builds
to
a
crescendo
thru
the
midtaste
the
finish
is
signaled
by
a
subdued
hop
bite
followed
by
an
alternating
malt
yeast
fade
aftertaste
is
spicy
sweet
with
residual
sugar
left
on
the
lips
drinkability

this
is
the
beer
that
all
the
locals
were
ordering
by
the
pitcher
its
a
terrific
belgian
session
ale
that
i
just
couldnt
get
enough
of
i
had
this
beer
at
pizza
port
in
solana
beach
the
beer
poured
a
reddish
brown
with
a
light
head
on
top
the
aroma
is
a
floral
and
sweet
smell
the
flavors
sinks
with
sour
cherry
wheat
and
dry
apricot
on
the
mouth
it
is
a
bit
thin
and
light
bodied
which
doesnt
seem
to
match
the
coarse
flavors
in
the
beer
it
could
be
a
daily
drinker
for
some
because
it
is
full
flavored
without
getting
crazy
on
your
tongue
the
beer
pours
golden
amber
with
a
semicreamy
white
head
that
is
moderate
in
size
a
nice
sheet
of
concealing
lace
seals
off
the
glass
nose
is
sweet
malt
crisp
and
a
bit
spicy
nice
yeast
presence
and
the
start
continues
the
sweet
malt
with
the
top
being
a
bit
more
than
moderate
in
its
feel
to
the
palate
pertinent
acidity
the
hops
masterful
in
their
spiciness
dry
aftertaste
a
real
treat
and
a
great
example
of
the
brewers
art
overall
this
was
a
nice
treat
its
a
unique
offering
for
the
style
well
i
guess
i
just
dont
have
the
make
up
to
like
belgian

i
really
am
trying
i

tres

better

good
moderately
high

mo
moderately
effervescent
mediumminus

the
flavour
profile
is
intended
to
be
complex
but
the
result
is
a
messy
beer
where
the
esters
rein
freely
hops
fail
to
compete
despite
so
much
effort
invested
3
hop
varieties
and
the
attenuation
level
couldve
been
tuned
higher
to
render
a
better
drinkability
i
really
find
very
little
to
like
about
this
beer
so
will
not
try
it
again
for
sure
the
flavor
is
somewhat
herbal
from
the
hops
with
a
light
fruit
tinge
from
the
yeast
which
has
a
subtle
applepear
like
flavor
with
mild
sweetness
from
the
malt
and
a
slightly
honey
like
tinge
with
subtle
grainy
quality
overall
this
is
a
tasty
bier
with
some
nice
yeast
components
in
the
flavor
with
mild
maltiness
and
fruitiness
making
for
an
interesting
belgian
ale
i
would
recommend
this
if
you
enjoy
the
style
this
is
pretty
good
i
like
this
representation
not
terribly
crisp
nor
very
fruity
lots
of
esters
that
mix
with
the
hops
to
create
complex
flavors
that
border
on
tropical
id
go
at
it
again
for
sure
pours
a
light
gold
aroma
of
musty
yeast
and
sweet
grains
in
the
taste
quite
sweet
like
refined
sugar
not
very
bitter
metallic
herbal
saaz
type
hops
only
faint
bitterness
alcohol
is
mild
medium
bodied
with
spritzy
carbonation
overall
this
is
an
average
everyday
table
beer
the
strength
was
there
but
the
flavors
could
have
been
more
pronounced
this
was
quite
light
overall
as
i
said
perhaps
not
the
most
complex
bière
de
garde
but
one
which
has
a
subtle
sophistication
that
really
rubs
me
the
right
way
wonderful
stuff
very
nice
tasty
and
balanced
it
looks
good
with
a
predominantly
yeasty
aromaflavour
illuminated
by
subtle
aromatic
hop
notes
the
body
is
great
it
glides
over
the
palate
like
silk
the
influence
of
belgium
and
the
us
are
discernible
with
a
yeast
profile
that
reminds
me
of
a
belgian
blonde
and
hopping
that
recalls
an
american
pale
ale
a
solid
effort
that
goes
down
almost
too
easily
worthy
of
your
time
if
you
come
across
it
o
this
was
a
pleasant
surprise
found
it
at
the
convenient
store
next
to
the
byob
restaurant
i
was
having
dinner
at
and
bought
it
on
a
whim
and
had
some
decent
hints
of
saison
as
well
easy
to
drink
and
paired
well
with
the
spicy
pepperoni
pizza
i
was
enjoying
interesting
and
quite
quaffable
d
very
high
this
is
a
pretty
complex
beer
which
is
pretty
easy
to
overlook
because
it
is
so
well
constructed
despite
the
complexity
and
because
of
the
construction
it
is
highly
highly
drinkable
d
an
eminently
drinkable
brew
very
nice
for
style
delicate
complex
and
intriguing
refreshing
and
wonderfully
sessionable
its
light
and
bright
and
slightly
sweet
carbonation
is
soft
this
is
easy
to
drink
and
would
seemingly
pair
with
almost
any
food
its
a
nice
beer
o
very
nice
biere
de
garde
very
saisonesque
but
its
lighter
and
crisper
than
most
with
a
nice
hop
presence
but
its
no
westcoast
ipa
of
course
i
guess
i
would
describe
it
as
a
mild
ipa
and
a
saison
hybrid
tasty
nice
to
see
france
getting
in
on
the
americaninfluenced
beers
along
with
britain
and
belgium
this
is
pitched
as
an
ipabiere
de
garde
hybrid
three
hops
in
here
from
3
continents
apparently
and
im
guessing
theres
both
traditional
and
us
in
there
along
with
nz
tropical
fruit
adds
up
to
a
multilayered
hop
kick
which
together
with
a
very
soft
body
makes
this
very
easy
to
drink
and
a
great
dinner
table
beer
i
recommend
that
french
beer
bellerose
for
all
the
beer
lovers
who
want
to
discover
and
appreciate
new
flavor
and
taste
enjoy
to
sum
up
my
bellerose
experience
o
a
good
drink
for
spring

summer
days

beer
mouthfeel
is
light
but
with
mild
carbonation
very
easy
drinkingim
definitely
going
to
pick
this
one
up
again
best
sour
ive
ever
had
has
spicy
notes
almost
like
a
pinot
noir
or
zinfandel
wine
o
a
decent
funky
treat
with
nice
layers
of
flavor
and
a
punchy
sourness
yet
both
subtle
and
approachable
really
really
refreshing
and
most
of
all
clean
rich
clear
flavors
not
a
single
off
note
as
much
as
youd
look
for
one
not
the
most
complex
but
i
dont
really
care
anymore
i
just
want
another

if

why
not

it
sometimes
the
info
on

of
the

says
more
about
what
the
brewer
hoped
it
would
taste
like
rather
than
what
it
actually
tastes

also

my

may
be

the
taste
oro

is
a
great
beer
you
must
love
funk
to
enjoy
this
beer
the
8
abv
is
almost
non
existent
making
this
quite
a
refreshing
brew
on
a
hot
summers
night
if
oro
de
calabaza
is
indicative
of
what
of
jolly
pumpkin
has
to
offer
i
can
hardly
what
to
try
their
other
brews
o
this
is
a
damn
tasty
biere
de
garde
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
final
word
an
interesting
drink
but
not
one
that
i
must
have
again
my
favorite
part
of
the
brew
was
the
peppery
character
which
kept
the
profile
lively
and
interesting
as
the
other
characteristics
like
the
tart
lemon
and
yeast
didnt
present
anything
out
of
the
ordinary
certainly
good
and
always
worth
trying
but
i
would
seek
out
other
jolly
pumpkin
brews
first
if
you
are
having
trouble
choosing
i
havent
had
many
bière
de
gardes
but
for
what
ive
had
this
is
very
good
the
pale
and
lightly
toasty
caramel
malt
base
is
nice
the
sour
tart
and
spicy
flavors
simply
round
out
the
flavor
its
very
easy
to
drink
and
i
wouldnt
have
guessed
its
8
abv
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
very
nice
beer
and
i
thought
it
was
a
good
example
of
a
biere
de
garde
and
it
was
another
good
example
of
a
funky
jolly
pumpkin
beer
it
had
pretty
much
all
the
aspects
that
i
look
for
in
the
style
along
with
some
nice
balance
this
beer
had
good
drinkability
it
was
smooth
fairly
crisp
not
too
acidic
a
little
refreshing
not
filling
at
all
and
the
taste
did
a
good
job
of
holding
my
attention
i
think
two
of
these
would
be
a
good
amount
for
me
and
i
could
see
myself
having
a
couple
while
sitting
on
the
porch
on
a
warm
summers
day
what
i
like
the
most
about
this
beer
was
balance
no
aspect
was
too
overpowering
and
the
flavors
and
aromas
blended
well
with
each
other
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
nothing
its
good
just
the
way
it
is
but
i
do
wish
it
was
just
a
little
cheaper
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
and
i
think
ill
be
keeping
a
couple
bottles
in
the
fridge
for
this
summer
i
would
recommend
this
beer
especially
if
you
like
like
a
nice
lightly
funky
biere
de
garde
all
in
all
i
was
pretty
happy
with
this
beer
and
i
thought
that
nice
bright
lemon
aspect
was
a
little
impressive
its
up
there
as
one
of
the
better
biere
de
gardes
ive
had
and
i
think
it
might
just
be
my
favorite
of
the
three
year
round
jolly
pumpkin
beers
that
made
it
into
350ml
bottles
but
its
pretty
hard
to
choose
between
this
one
and
la
roja
good
job
guys
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
keep
up
the
great
work
o
im
not
a
fan
of
the
biere
de
garde
but
this
one
is
very
good
after
the
jolly
pumpkin
treatment
more
of
a
wild
than
a
biere
de
garde
but
im
not
complaining
and
it
tastes
great
very
easy
to
drink
sour
with
increasing
complexity
as
it
warms
up
overall
i
will
add
this
to
my
list
of
the
belgian
beers
i
like
good
for
the
expert
quaffer
and
the
enthusiastic
amateur
moi
alike
definitely
worth
the
price
of
admission
its
smooth
a
bit
of
movement
from
carbonation
adding
just
enough
crispness
as
well
the
body
is
a
good
medium
dark
golden
color
with
a
half
inch
white
head
that
quickly
dissipates
aroma
of
strong
white
wine
and
oak
sharply
tart
taste
at
first
then
becomes
fruity
with
white
grapes
dominating
the
palate
lingers
with
oak
on
the
finish
and
slightly
sour
delilicious
medium
bodied
and
the
correct
amount
of
carbonation
light
highly
recommended
overall
a
pretty
nice
belgian
but
maybe
not
quite
as
clean
as
id
like
im
running
back
through
many
of
the
jolly
pumpkin
beers
lately
i
feel
like
i
always
forget
about
them
and
overlook
them
in
the
face
of
so
many
other
sours
and
wilds
these
days
but
these
are
still
head
of
the
class
in
many
ways
this
one
is
a
golden
edition
a
little
cloudy
and
pale
yellow
not
dissimilar
to
the
label
on
the
bottle
great
nose
of
white
pepper
and
wild
yeast
belgian
yeast
and
fruity
hops
i
get
some
apricot
and
honey
in
this
too
summery
vibes
abound
the
flavor
has
a
fair
bit
of
funk
to
it
yeast
is
the
dominant
flavor
agent
here
dried
and
fresh
apricots
both
carry
through
the
middle
pale
and
wheat
malt
thickens
it
up
and
a
distinct
belgian
yeasty
spiciness
takes
over
in
the
finish
more
hoppy
than
many
other
jolly
pumpkin
beers
too
they
have
held
up
well
in
a
bottle
thats
close
to
a
year
old
now
i
love
the
dynamic
yeast
profile
here
the
best
of
both
wild
and
belgian
worlds
and
the
lighter
body
of
this
beer
allows
them
both
to
be
on
full
display
well
carbonated
and
soft
in
feel
like
most
of
their
beers
to
me
this
beer
inspires
food
pairings
ill
have
to
get
a
few
more
bottles
and
cook
up
o
this
is
an
excellent
beer
but
a
departure
from
what
i
expected
i
would
never
crave
this
nye
bottle
share
at
proof
pours
a
slightly
hazy
yellow
with
a
touch
of
peach
good
amount
of
white
head
that
faded
fairly
quickly
but
held
a
nice
medium
collar
citrusy
aroma
but
i
doubt
its
from
hops
a
touch
of
estery
fruitiness
too
taste
is
the
same
but
with
some
funk
nice
medhigh
carbonation
and
medium
body
low
b
it
was
a
gift
so
i
cannot
evaluate
the
cost
to
say
i
would
buy
it
again
if
it
was
under
10
dollars
then
yes
overall
it
has
a
good
drinkability
and
a
nice
light
body
that
would
pair
well
with
food
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
this
is
a
great
sour
another
fine
job
by
jp
jolly
pumpkin
beers
have
really
been
growing
on
me
lately

you
can

i
was
not
superly
impressed
with
this
fresh

aged
wow
if
you
can
let
one
of
these
sit
for
a
bit
do
it
great
beer
o
a
definite
specialty
belgian
with
lots
of
character
highly
rcecommended
and
very
worth
the
price
point
o
really
well
done
with
lots
of
varying
flavors
the
spice
and
sour
notes
really
work
well
together
but
at
8
there
is
a
good
malt
backbone
supporting
it
all
oro
de
calabaza
has
a
hazy
yelloworange
appearance
topped
with
a
thin
layer
of
pure
white
its
got
a
zesty
aroma
reminiscent
of
orange
rind
pepper
cloves
and
vinegar
an
array
of
candied
flavors
fills
the
mouth
upon
the
first
taste
like
taffy
jolly
ranchers
and
sweet
melon
as
well
as
other
aspects
that
include
dark
grapes
and
cabernet
excellent
theres
moderate
acidity
present
here
and
it
finishes
with
a
pleasant
numbing
of
the
palate
i
only
felt
the
slight
sense
that
this
was
a
relatively
high
abv
beer
overall
this
is
an
almost
surprisingly
good
example
of
the
biere
de
garde
style
from
an
american
brewery
if
youre
relatively
new
to
this
type
like
myself
this
is
a
good
starting
point
lightly
tart
with
all
the
charm
and
damp
musty
flavors
one
can
expect
from
jolly
pumpkin
nice
blend
of
oak
and
tart
flavors
without
every
really
hitting
full
stride
ill
have
to
try
it
fresh
to
see
how
it
compares
but
its
good
not
great
as
a
wild
for
the
style
its
great
hazy
yellow
color
lemon
slight
brett
funk
on
the
palate
dry
but
with
a
boozy
sweetness
that
lingers
bright
acidity
in
balance
light
but
not
thin
tad
bitterness
in
finish
seems
to
be
just
a
stronger
version
of
bam
which
i
still
prefer
over
this
pours
a
murky
whitishyellow
with
a
foamy
bone
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
sour
and
tart
with
malt
fruit
and
funky
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
sour
fruit
wood
and
buttery
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
woody
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
the
buttery
flavor
i
am
getting
is
unexpected
o
forgot
how
much
i
enjoy
this
beer
love
having
jolly
pumpkin
in
ma
on

at
kickbacks
in
jax
white
fluffy
head
high
retention
soapy
lacing
aroma
includes
green
apple
lemon
green
grapes
taste
is
pleasantly
and
lightly
tart
less
tart
than
expected
based
on
the
aroma
granny
smith
apple
dominates
the
flavor
but
its
seems
like
some
other
tropical
fruit
is
also
in
the
mix
maybe
star
fruit
very
refreshing
and
tasty
othis
beer
is
awesome
one
of
my
favorite
sourish
beers
although
i
wouldnt
keep
it
too
long
as
i
feel
it
will
lose
the
hop
profile
as
my
2011
has
but
still
a
stellar
beer
o
tasty
goes
down
very
easily
not
too
filling
good
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
good
sour
beer
to
drink
for
a
long
time
o
an
extremely
refreshing
an
satisfying
brew
tartness
is
mild
and
balanced
perfectly
definitely
not
a
sour
beer
but
tart
and
complex
enough
to
drink
and
enjoy
every
fat
while
still
figuring
out
its
secrets
and
complexities
a
definitely
must
have
from
ron
jeffrey
over
at
jolly
pumpkin
overall
i
feel
like
i
could
drink
gallons
of
this
it
just
makes
me
happy
medium
bodied
just
shy
of
creamy
actually
with
lots
of
tingling
carbonation
to
sting
the
upper
lip
again
like
many
brews
from

the
finish
is
nearly
moistureless

even
better
its

tartness
to
it
ends
up
being
memorable
o
i
might
try
this
again
soon
however
this
really
didnt
leave
a
exciting
impression
o
excellent
drinkability
my
first
jolly
pumpkin
good
surprise
pretty
good
beer
edit
looking
back
at
the
last
few
reviews
the
comments
are
quite
similar
and
the
bottles
seem
to
be
from
the
january
2013
batch
would
love
to
read
something
from
an
aged
bottle
to
get
a
grip
on
how
odc
performs
in
the
cellar
o
this
is
a
nice
light
easy
drinking
sour
that
is
especially
good
in
terms
of
drinkability
given
8abv
there
is
a
good
sour
funk
though
a
light
one
that
mixes
well
with
a
pepper
kick
to
have
a
solid
overall
taste
and
feel
it
looks
good
and
only
the
scent
there
isnt
much
to
say
about
i
enjoyed
this
as
i
have
all
the
jolly
pumpkin
sours
ive
tried
and
is
definitely
worth
a
try
drink
it
if
youre
looking
for
bubbles
and
light
funk
o
another
solid
brew
by
jolly
the
pepper
spices
and
barnyard
funk
here
creates
a
nice
uniqueness
definitely
worthy
of
a
try
a
bit
too
much
contribution
from
the
brett
and
various
flora
here
for
my
taste
well
worth
checking
out
if
youre
looking
for
something
tart
and
funkforward
all
in
all
another
solid
and
fairly
unique
beer
from
jp
spot
on
to
the
style
which
to
be
honest
is
maybe
not
my
favorite
belgian
style
light
on
the
brett
personally
i
wouldve
liked
a
bit
more
but
it
works
a
worthy
beer

this
is
really
tasty
really
really
tasty
it
has
a
light
body
with
a
medium
carbonation
its
a
well
rounded
beer
with
a
good
amount
of
drinkability
osomething
different
thats
for
sure
similar
to
rayon
vert
but
with
its
own
unique
qualities
will
definitely
grab
one
again

o
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
style
but
this
is
good
one
of
the
better
saisonstyle
beers
ive
had
i
know
it
might
not
be
a
traditional
saison
but
i
judge
all
these
types
of
beers
by
weyerbacher

this
is
good
id
have
it
again
and
id
recommend
to
fans
of
the
style
doesnt
blow
me
away
though
probably
my
favorite
from
jolly
pumpkin
so
far
i
prefer
this
aged
bottle
to
on
tap
though
on
tap
it
can
be
quite
refreshing
poured
a
nice
hazy
bronze
tinged
yellow
with
a
small
white
head
smells
of
tart
sour
fruit
bretty
funk
and
a
little
wheat
the
first
thing
that
hit
my
palette
was
the
sour
not
mouth
puckering
but
not
terribly
weak
either
next
the
waves
of
brett
some
hayfunk
and
that
signature
fruityturnedfunk
goodness
coronation
is
pretty
nice
small
tight
bubbles
roll
over
the
mouth
but
the
lacing
is
minimal
the
overall
package
is
well
done
not
as
sour
as
some
of
the
jp
offerings
with
a
more
pronounced
brett
character
really
well
done
and
a
great
stepping
stone
beer
for
newbies
in
the
realm
of
yourwild
brews
oa
nice
smooth
blend
of
sour
and
funk
that
is
very
drinkable
nothing
overly
complex
just
a
solid
well
crafted
beer
overall
decent
beer
not
the
most
tasty
beer
i
have
had
but
it
was
good
to
try
i
wish
the
fruitiness
was
more
apparent
in
the
taste
picked
up
two
bottles
of
this
back
in
the
summer
was
bottled
late
may
2012
had
the
first
bottle
shortly
after
purchase
and
saved
the
second
until
now
i
have
to
say
a
half
year
did
this
beer
some
justice
wishing
i
saved
the
other
bottle
for
even
longer
first
bottle
poured
clear
while
the
second
had
some
slight
hazyness
to
it
tastes
just
slightly
sour
with
some
fruit
tastes
of
green
apples
and
grapes
coming
through
with
the
tart
finish
incredibly
easy
to
drink
for
8
and
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
nice
a
pretty
good
beer
overall
and
i
would
love
to
have
this
with
even
more
age
on
it
i
let
this
warm
up
a
lot
over
time
i
prefer
it
while
its
still
on
the
cool
side
worth
a
try
but
this
is
really
expensive
this
beer
is
a
clear
lightgold
colored
liquid
with
a
soft
and
thick
white
head
beautiful
lace
the
aroma
is
of
soft
pale
malt
with
an
equal
amount
of
funk
there
is
a
solid
oak
characteristic
with
some
distant
peppery
spice
as
well
the
taste
is
subtle
at
first
with
a
firm
bitter
midtaste
and
sharp
finish
there
is
some
funk
a
little
sourness
an
a
round
softness
in
body
that
really
accentuates
the
beer
the
body
is
one
of
the
most
alluring
traits
of
this
brew
its
refreshing
in
spite
of
its
high
abv
and
very
remarkably
drinkable
overall
one
of
my
favorite
jolly
pumpkin
brews
solid
and
very
drinkable
o
extremely
easy
to
drink
due
to
the
very
well
hidden
alcohol
cant
believe
this
is
8
abv
and
lighter
notes
of
funky
sourness
i
really
enjoy
the
flavors
and
aromas
of
this
beer
kudos
to
my
motherinlaw
for
grabbing
this
one
and
her
and
my
grandmotherinlaw
both
really
enjoyed
it
o
this
style
is
growing
on
me
and
jolly
pumpkin
is
one
of
the
forerunners
for
sours
in
america
overall
another
great
jolly
pumpkin
beer
i
always
over
look
them
and
i
need
to
stop
because
i
have
yet
to
be
disappointed
by
any
of
their
beer
o
a
nice
slightly
sour
biere
de
garde
i
wish
it
was
a
bit
drier
but
this
beer
has
a
great
complexity
a
nice
barrel
aged
sour
thats
not
too
sour
or
heavy
on
the
barrel
id
struggle
to
place
this
into
a
style
so
for
now
ill
just
state
its
worth
looking
for
oa
very
nice
beer
from
jolly
pumpkin
i
drank
it
by
itself
this
time
but
would
like
to
pair
it
with
a
nice
seafood
dish
perhaps
some
sort
of
clam
chowder
will
be
a
frequent
purchase
come
springtime
overall
good
very
good
in
some
ways
but
the
aftertaste
doesnt
quite
work
for
me
oa
nice
sour
with
good
balance
of
flavors
a
lovely
golden
ale
the
big
wild
yeast
edges
softened
by
the
barrel
time
and
other
farmhouse
goodies
chiming
in
tasty
and
a
commendable
example
of
the
style
jd
a
tasty
beer
that
ill
have
to
revisit
o
a
taste
distinguishable
tart
sour
and
vinegar
flavor
also
there
is
a
modest
peppery
spice
or
even
a
peppery
hop
presence
im
not
sure
which
but
either
way
peppery
and
spicy
with
a
slight
oak
fade
basically
i
didnt
find
anything
wrong
with
this
beer
the
only
remark
ill
leave
with
is
that
sours
can
be
astringent
and
unless
you
have
something
to
scrape
your
palate
clean
u
might
need
to
limit
your
sour
intake
stay
curious
my
friends
overall
lots
of
spice
i
liked
it
had
a
bottle
of
this
at
blue
tractor
in
a2
pours
clear
golden
with
light
fluffy
head
smells
sour
and
floral
with
hints
of
pears
and
a
bit
of
spice
taste
is
a
sour
explosion
of
pear
and
white
grape
notes
slight
tart
on
the
palate
that
lingers
spice
and
yeast
give
it
a
nice
balance
of
dry
and
fruity
refreshing
one
of
my
favorite
jp
brews
for
sure
so
easy
drinking
well
i
cant
explain
the
gusher
at
opening
it
was
refrigerated
for
several
days
and
wasnt
shaken
i
did
take
it
out
of
the
fridge
and
let
it
sit
for
two
hours
and
then
rerefrigerated
it
for
30
minutes
prior
to
opening
in
any
case
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
but
i
wonder
what
a
different
bottle
may
produce
as
far
as
impressions
go
i
certainly
dont
get
the
toasted
malt
aromas
or
sweet
malt
tastes
as
per
the
ba
beer
description
for
a
biere
de
garde
style
brew
to
me
this
comes
across
like
a
german
hefeweizenflanders
wild
ale
cross
not
bad
but
not
exactly
what
i
expected
othe
flavors
just
arent
there
for
me
it
has
a
decent
tartness
but
its
actually
a
very
boring
beer
i
dont
mind
very
boring
beers
unless
i
pay
a
high
price
like
i
did
for
this
one
its
drinkable
thats
about
it
overall
this
is
definitely
in
my
top
five
get
it
if
you
can
when
you
can
another
hit
from
jolly
pumpkin
i
love
wild
beers
and
im
determined
after
this
one
and
la
roja
to
get
my
hands
on
as
many
as
possible
especially
aged
version
the
wild
character
dominates
everything
here
and
i
love
it
overall
oro
de
calabaza
isnt
as
balanced
and
complex
as
the
dark
dawn
stout
but
its
still
an
enjoyable
contemplative
quaff
nonetheless
worth
buying
overall
i
dont
think
ill
ever
buy
another
jolly
pumpkin
again
overall
almost
always
on
the
money
jolly
pumpkin
rarely
fails
to
impress
and
although
this
may
be
one
of
their
more
straightforward
offerings
its
still
a
charm
everyone
should
like
this
beer
from
the
newbie
to
the
most
jaded
connoisseur
o
this
beer
is
nothing
like
the
previous
bière
de
garde
ive
tasted
which
was
a
jenlain
ambrée
this
one
is
very
mouthpuckering
tart
and
sour
but
i
did
enjoy
this
my
first
offering
from
jolly
pumpkin
overall
the
oak
aging
is
all
over
this
midway
through
tasting
and
though
it
can
be
intense
it
is
a
quality
brew
nonetheless
t
definite
chardonnay
notes
upfron
with
some
lemon
green
grape
pear
granny
smith
apple
straight
funk
an
some
pineapple
on
the
finish
a
great
prickly
carbonation
and
light
mouthfeel
make
this
a
great
summer
beer
amazing
stuff
overall
the
flavors
are
unique
but
work
together
well
o
damn
this
is
a
delicious
beer
continuing
my
journey
into
sours
this
is
a
top
notch
one
complex
as
hell
and
delicious
good
intro
to
a
beginner
one
hell
of
a
jp
beer
this
was
my
first
jolly
pumpkin
brew
and
im
very
glad
the
local
liquor
store
stocks
several
of
their
brews
as
this
was
incredible
im
unfamiliar
with
the
biere
de
garde
style
but
im
guessing
this
is
one
of
those
that
defies
classification
im
looking
forward
to
having
their
other
brews
in
styles
that
i
am
familiar
with
o
would
drink
again
very
nicely
complex
especially
in
aroma
very
well
balanced
and
drinkable
happy
with
another
great
brew
from
jp
hayward
abbey
rating
82
an
insanely
good
beer
that
id
pitch
in
on
to
split
with
somebody
about
13
a
bomber
o
highly
impressed
with
this
complex
yet
delicate
offering
from
jolly
pumpkin
easy
drinking
subtly
sour
and
elegant
i
am
glad
i
grab
a
few
bottles
of
this
as
i
will
enjoy
this
as
much
as
possible
this
summer
the
high
points
of
this
beer
is
balance
sweet
tart
woody
yeasty
refreshing
the
aroma
is
bigtime
here
flavor
is
a
little
more
subtle
but
very
good
balance
highly
recommended
a
pure
white
bubbly
head
floats
away
quickly
and
leaves
a
smattering
of
froth
the
brew
itself
is
a
murky
grapefruit
like
pinkishorange
can
you
say
breakfast
smells
yeasty
with
a
smattering
of
light
fruits
orange
pear
lemon
green
apple
a
slight
aroma
of
funk
and
dry
hay
lies
deep
within
tastes
tangy
up
front
with
a
following
of
sugary
sweetness
obviously
fruity
as
with
the
smell
has
a
touch
of
brett
spice
and
just
the
right
amount
of
sour
fruit
and
hoppiness
to
bring
things
full
circle
light
to
medium
in
body
and
has
that
distinctive
jolly
pumpkin
crispness
my
favorite
jp
brew
so
far
o
this
beer
is
almost
too
much
for
me
so
sour
so
yeasty
so
rich
but
its
so
enjoyable
i
guess
ill
have
to
try
out
more
jolly
pumpkin
because
this
one
was
unique
and
delicious
bottled
5411
pours
with
a
huge
billowy
white
head
that
leaves
some
lacing
on
the
glass
a
bit
over
carbonated
got
a
bit
of
a
gusher
when
i
opened
it
some
nice
head
retention
aroma
is
really
grapefriut
and
lemon
rindey
with
a
bit
of
funk
but
not
a
ton
big
pungent
aroma
not
at
all
subtle
flavor
has
a
bit
of
soft
sourness
along
with
a
lot
of
funk
and
nice
green
apple
citrus
rind
and
some
champagne
fruityness
despite
the
gusher
and
high
carb
initially
it
seems
like
the
gusher
dissipated
a
lot
of
the
carb
i
was
very
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
beer
mouthfeel
is
great
also
light
body
with
moderate
carbonation
and
the
funk
comes
through
pretty
strong
this
is
a
wild
ale
to
me
and
a
delicious
and
well
balanced
one
at
that
excellent
i
voted
for
the
beer
pairing
on
this
one
the
general
concensus
was
that
the
beer
was
better
when
paired
with
the
food
than
the
wine
a
good
beer
the
tartness
adds
some
character
but
still
seems
a
bit
forgettable
overall
beer
is
mediumbodied
with
subtle
carbonation
allowing
this
to
be
savored
on
the
palate
finish
is
dry
alcohol
is
undetectable
o
for
10
and
as
readily
available
as
this
is
its
a
great
beer
i
could
easily
drink
the
22
ounce
bottle
if
i
had
the
chance
cant
wait
until
my
beer
using
the
dregs
from
this
one
finishes
jolly
pumpkins
beers
are
a
treat
and
this
is
no
exception
if
you
can
try
this
if
you
like
wild
yeast
ales
with
sourness
and
funk
this
one
will
win
you
over
after
first
sip
hazed
gold
with
a
collar
of
white
foam
that
sticks
in
thick
clumps
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
clean
lactic
sourness
is
upfront
with
a
pleasant
grainy
cereal
backdrop
lemon
peel
hay
and
leather
come
out
is
warms
up
the
sourness
is
balanced
by
a
subtle
oaky
tanic
note
a
really
terrific
sour
and
the
best
beer
ive
had
from
jolly
pumpkin
with
la
roja
a
close
second
overall
this
is
my
favorite
jolly
pumpkin
brew
to
date
nicely
balanced
and
very
easy
to
drink
this
beer
will
hold
up
very
well
for
years
to
come
this
is
an
awesome
beer
my
first
from
jolly
pumpkin
complex
big
and
refreshing
i
love
it
o
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
it
was
great
beer
to
have
on
this
warm
spring
night
o
overall
i
really
like
this
beer
i
would
get
it
again
and
once
again
jolly
pumpkin
has
made
me
happy
i
love
this
beer
and
will
most
definitely
consider
buying

notes

rifugium
o
not
as
good
here
ontap
as
i
remember
it
from
the
bottle
it
might
be
the
stale
flavor
id
not
noticed
from
the
bottle
and
perhaps
because
i
was
having
it
sidebyside
with
russian
river
tempation
and
supplication
overall
to
me
this
tastes
like
a
mini
fantôme
saison
which
is
definitely
a
good
thing
there
is
a
bit
more
complexity
and
intrigue
in
the
fantôme
which
accounts
for
my
higher
scores
but
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
bee
this
is
a
nice
bière
de
garde
its
always
remarkable
how
the
nose
and
palate
differ
on
certain
jp
beers
overall
a
solid
golden
all
with
a
very
refreshing
sourness
and
just
enough
funk
without
tasting
like
a
dead
horse
i
would
highly
recommend
seeking
this
one
out
a
great
beer
for
the
wild
ale
enthusiast
or
the
beginner
alike
another
wellconstructed
beer
from
jolly
pumpkin
sipping
on
this
makes
me
wonder
why
i
dont
drink
their
stuff
more
often
taste
is
very
complex
and
delicious
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
but
the
flavors
really
explode
in
the
back
of
your
throat
somewhat
sour
but
thats
only
one
dimension
there
is
also
more
citrus
and
a
nice
wild
yeast
taste
somewhat
like
drinking
a
good
chardonnay
or
champagne
very
nice
overall
i
love
this
beer
so
much
this
is
the
first
funky
tart
bier
de
garde
ive
ever
tasted
its
absolutely
amazing
how
they
retain
the
maltyness
associated
with
a
bier
de
garde
with
the
funk
of
a
traditional
farmhouse
ale
the
tartness
and
sour
isnt
at
all
overpowering
its
absolutely
perfectly
balanced
o
delicious
i
love
these
guys
its
as
close
as
you
can
get
to
wine
through
brewing
and
the
result
is
better
than
wine
o
this
is
one
tasty
belgian
style
ale
while
i
would
have
definitely
appreciated
just
a
touch
more
sourness
you
can
tell
thats
not
what
they
were
going
for
with
this
and
its
nice
for
once
not
to
get
that
acid
overload
with
a
tart
beer
the
oakiness
really
rounds
everything
out
in
the
end
very
very
well
done
o
a
well
crafted
very
tasty
beer
that
would
go
well
with
just
about
any
meal
i
would
say
linguine
and
clams
has
a
lot
of
crisp
white
winelike
qualities
but
more
way
more
flavor
and
depth
due
to
the
wild
yeast
very
refreshing
and
drinkable
o
not
surprised
that
i
like
this
i
havent
had
a
bad
jolly
pumpkin
this
beer
is
refreshing
which
is
awesome
given
that
it
sits
at
8
overall
this
is
my
first
jolly
pumpkin
brew
it
and
wont
be
my
last
a
great
balance
between
wheatlike
golden
ale
and
sour
wild
ale
this
brew
quenches
it
hard
yeeeaaah
buddy
tight
sharp
carbonation
beautifully
compliments
the
tart
sour
fruits
drying
but
juicy
a
great
beverage
on
par
with
russian
rivers
belgian
offerings
cheers
o
this
is
a
great
beer
that
seems
to
be
getting
better
with
every
sip
another
great
beer
from
jolly
pumpkin
definitely
will
be
buying
this
again
oro
de
calabaza
pours
a
mildly
hazy
lemon
yellow
theres
maybe
two
fingers
of
head
and
the
foam
shows
a
little
bit
of
retention
but
next
to
no
lacing
the
nose
is
an
excellent
blend
of
a
classic
biere
de
garde
and
a
wild
ale
theres
some
honey
and
bready
malt
sweetness
dueling
with
straight
up
funk
for
the
role
of
primary
aroma
a
light
clove
spiciness
stays
firmly
planted
in
the
background
the
flavor
doesnt
quite
live
up
that
most
of
what
was
found
in
the
aroma
is
still
here
but
the
deeper
bready
malt
notes
are
a
bit
lost
here
and
the
honey
thats
left
behind
isnt
sturdy
enough
to
balance
the
beer
the
funk
and
slightly
peppery
phenols
still
play
to
good
effect
though
theres
just
something
off
about
the
mouthfeel
though
the
body
is
a
little
thinner
than
the
typical
biere
de
garde
which
i
suppose
is
to
be
expected
given
the
different
wild
yeastbacteria
at
work
the
carbonation
though
just
falls
totally
dull
and
lifeless
by
mid
sip
id
like
to
come
back
to
another
bottle
of
oro
de
calabaza
that
has
a
bit
more
age
on
it
though
i
liked
it
fresh
i
think
id
probably
enjoy
it
more
after
giving
the
critters
some
more
time
to
work
their
magic
o
easily
drinkable
i
think
it
would
be
a
nice
babystep
beer
to
introduce
to
someone
on
the
fence
about
sour
beers
o
crisp
clean
golden
not
your
typical
jp
beer
but
incredibly
enjoyable
after
a
bit
of
googling
i
found
that
a
rough
translation
of
oro
de
calabaza
means
golden
pumpkin
this
golden
pumpkin
is
one
that
i
will
definitely
be
buying
again
o
a
lot
of
fun
very
refreshing
drink
and
overall
great
beer
tastes
like
a
nice
oak
aged
funked
up
aged
saison
really
enjoyed
this
beer
another
score
from
a
great
michigan
brewery
overall
impression
jolly
pumpkin
has
done
it
again
i
swear
by
it
this
brewery
has
some
of
the
most
interesting
and
fun
brews
this
biere
de
garde
hits
almost
every
category
with
the
appropriate
amount
of
character
and
more
great
citrus
and
sour
character
within
a
very
complexed
brew
i
would
suggest
you
trying
this
one
and
every
other
one
of
these
one
thing
i
recommend
is
doing
a
price
check
with
the
jolly
pumpkins
before
hand
because
sometimes
you
find
yourself
overpaying
for
these
ones
o
after
we
got
past
the
gushing
quality
we
were
able
to
actually
pour
the
beer
and
it
was
very
solid
i
enjoyed
the
style
very
much
and
would
revisit
in
the
future
phenomenal
beautiful
golden
hazy
color
2
inch
sturdy
creamcolored

smells
of
belgiantype
malts
slight
toffee
touch
of
sourness
yeast
touch
of
oak
and
funk
wow
the
taste
blows
me
away
unexpected
fullness
of
flavor
tangy
apricot
belgian
fruits
oak
yeast
and
malt
slight
natural
yeast
spice
dense
and
complex
flavors
amazing
and
well
crafted
mouthfeel
is
dry
yet
full
with
good
clean
carbonation
leaving
the
mouth
feeling
fresh
and
ready
for
more
nice
sour
tannins
cause
a
slight
puckersalivation
after
the
fact
buy
this
beer
o
has
quite
a
refreshing
characteristic
to
it
solid
brew
it
adds
to
my
liking
of
the
biere
de
garde
style
overall
loving
this
thing
i
want
more
jolly
pumpkin
o
a
great
brew
a
great
little
mustyfunky
brew
that
would
be
great
on
any
day
i
certainly
plan
on
picking
up
a
few
more
of
these
beauties
in
the
future
tried
this
one
a
couple
sundays
ago
at
hops
pie
in
north
denver
poured
a
light
golden
color
with
a
rocky
white
head
slightly
tart
on
the
nose
with
aromas
of
lemon
wheat
and
green
apple
on
the
palate
light
bodied
and
tart
with
flavors
of
wheat
sour
green
apple
and
lemon
split
between
a
friend
and
i
it
was
the
evenings
favorite
there
is
a
definitle
brett
wild
yeast
influence
but
the
wealth
of
the
flavor
took
a
minute
to
develop
this
beer
needs
to
breathe
at
first
it
was
nothing
but
tart
and
somewhat
disappointly
one
dimensional
sour
beer
but
as
it
sat
and
we
had
it
with
food
too
soprasoda
an
english
blue
cheese
and
duck
pate
the
beer
has
that
beer
de
garde
undertone
that
was
so
interesting
in
the
face
of
the
sour
hints
of
twig
and
spice
and
a
noble
hop
grassy
floral
note
it
complimented
the
meaty
salty
with
a
sour
salty
and
hay
earthy
hint
well
stored
and
perfect
after
9
months
in
the
bottle
interest
take
and
accurate
to
the
style
just
initially
sour
dominated
better
as
it
warms
quality
greatly
increases
if
with
food
o
i
really
like
this
beer
it
isnt
cheap
and
that
has
to
taken
into
consideration
but
it
is
really
nice
into
a
tulip
snifter
pours
a
dark
golden
color
aroma
is
sour
laden
with
wheat
and
lemon
peel
in
the
taste
apple
cider
vinegar
but
not
sweet
there
is
a
moderate
bitterness
that
has
to
be
some
hop
character
peeking
through
nice
sour
almost
puckering
quite
funky
a
good
deal
of
complexity
every
sip
providing
a
unique
refreshingly
tart
experience
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
lingering
sour
note
semi
dry
overall
a
well
rounded
brew
recommended
overall
an
excellent
representation
of
the
style
nice
musty
aromas
and
flavors
good
sourvinegar
flavor
but
its
balanced
nicely
with
a
hint
of
malt
sweetness
d
stupendous
late
summer
beer
sit
back
and
sip
this
beer
on
your
deck
after
some
bbq
in
late
august
i
love
this
beer
right
now
o
im
gonna
have
to
rereview
this
i
feel
like
it
didnt
get
a
fair
shake
especially
since
im
not
sure
how
it
was
stored
for
the
last
2
years
ill
be
back
another
delicious
offering
from
jolly
pumpkin
tart
crisp
perfect
for
summer
the
flavor
is
also
excellent
i
like
the
oakiness
there
is
a
nice
burn
as
well
as
a
good
dose
of
alcohol
in
it
there
are
strong
belgian
yeastiness
in
this
body
this
is
a
very
good
tasting
beer
wow
uncapped
the
bottle
and
an
instant
volcano
of
foam
an
aroma
shot
out
it
pours
with
great
head
and
thick
sticky
lacing
the
smell
is
sweet
like
apricots
and
candy
sugar
with
a
wonderful
sour
and
oak
background
taste
is
sour
apple
up
front
flushed
by
a
warming
gritty
malt
backbone
finishes
clean
and
dry
with
a
fruity
walnut
wood
like
flavor
absolutely
outstanding
d
oh
so
good
this
is
true
testament
to
brewing
artistry
excellent
offering
from
jolly
pumpkin
there
is
so
much
depth
and
complexity
with
each
sip
its
staggering
i
love
this
beer
and
highly
recommend
to
anyone
who
thinks
that
their
palette
is
ready
for
a
challenge
a
sipper
that
i
could
sip
on
glass
after
glass
after
wonderful
glass
did
i
mention
that
i
like
this
beer
the
sourness
threw
me
for
a
bit
but
once
i
figured
it
out
i
was
able
to
experience
the
peaches
and
the
barrelaged
characteristics
this
came
highly
recommended
at
the
four
firkins
and
it
is
very
unique
but
did
not
entirely
live
up
to
the
hype
o
im
not
a
fan
of
beers
with
too
much
funk
in
flavor
and
oro
definitely
fits
in
that
category
with
that
said
the
other
categories
particularly
appearance
and
smell
shore
up

o
i
enjoyed
this
offering
from
jolly
pumpkin
a
great
summertime
beer
o
i
liked
this
beer
a
lot
one
of
the
more
successful
american
attempts
at
a
somewhat
belgian
style
it
was
priced
pretty
well
and
with
the
higher
abv
im
sure
it
will
age
quite
gracefully
overall
though
this
isnt
so
bad
but
its
a
very
jarring
drink
a
little
hard
to
get
use
to
this
one
feels
like
a
slow
sipper
too
which
seems
a
little
too
bad
in
this
case
for
me
dont
think
ill
have
this
again
beer
is
medium
to
light
in
body
and
heavily
carbonated
on
the
palate
the
beer
is
interesting
and
sweet
with
a
nice
dry
late
bitterness
to
it
i
guess
the
carbonation
is
thinning
it
out
too
much
i
enjoyed
it
truly
and
id
have
it
again
appropriately
tart
with
nice
bitterness
and
a
decent
backbone
cheers
o
another
winner
from
jolly
pumpkin
this
is
a
really
nice
beer
d
a
great
beer
for
summertime
crisp
and
delicious
with
a
complex
spicy
and
hop
profile
so
far
i
have
not
really
truly
enjoyed
a
biere
de
garde
but
this
one
sure
carried
it
home
this
is
an
interesting
beer
it
reminds
me
of
a
duvel
with
a
decent
amount
of
funk
not
my
favorite
but
definitely
good
would
drink
again
no
problem
o
really
good
i
will
definitely
have
this
again
this
style
is
one
of
my
favorite
summer
beers
and
this
is
no
exception
the
slight
tartness
and
the
clean
dry
finish
make
this
the
perfect
beer
on
a
hot
day
o
this
is
a
really
good
biere
de
garde
jolly
pumpkin
is
consistently
great
rating
95
out
of
100aged
do
drinkability
is
moderately
high
the
nose
on
this
had
me
reeling
a
little
bit
but
sticking
with
it
led
to
a
rewarding
flavor
its
really
easy
to
drink
especially
given
the
8
00
abv
a
nice
drinking
beer
that
i
wish
would
be
distributed
closer
to
me
overall
the
beer
is
good
decent
funk
thats
present
a
little
overwhelming
in
the
nose
but
is
still
not
something
that
makes
you
think
twice
about
each
sip
refreshing
citrus
and
bitterness
combined
with
the
tartness
and
funk
it
comes
across
as
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
the
8
abv
is
nearly
entirely
masked
so
i
feel
it
could
easily
be
quaffed
for
a
night
but
i
dont
think
more
than
1
bottle
would
be
necessary
d
would
i
drink
again
sure
i
would
if
you
like
a
good
fruity
tangy
and
spicy
beer
than
you
would
enjoy
this
beer
an
interesting
and
unique
belgian
style
ale
lots
of
flavor
and
tons
of
drinkability
overall
a
nice
beer
i
can
see
why
it
is
in
the
top

the

when

required
alcohol
is
not
felt
perfect
representative
of
the
style
the
only
objection
might
be
a
little
unbalanced
flavor
a
very
opaque
brightly
golden
yellow
beer
with
a
dense
thick
head
and
just
a
bit
of
belgian
lace
farmy
dusty
and
slightly
flowery
more
brett

funk
then

there
is
that
signature

some

belgian

quality
a
little
lemon

clean
crisp

and
high
notes
at
first
followed
quickly
by
bretty
horse
blanket
and
damp

some
spice
and
delicate
flavors
a
somehow
fuller
mouthfeel
presents
itself
on
the
finish
there
is
a
lingering
sourness
not
all
that
clean
a
unique
take
on
a
biere
de

id
indulge
in
this
one
again
o
overall
quite
a
good
beer
i
wish
the
belgian
tripelstrong
pale
ale
flavors
were
a
bit
more
balanced
with
the
sourness
and
funk
like
the
aroma
is
but
its
still
very
good
overall
this
was
very
interesting
and
a
very
solid
offering
medium
bodied
higher
carbonation
dry
and
spritzy
this
tasted
alright
but
this
wasnt
the
first
time
i
had
a
gusher
from
jp
which
is
really
annoying
id
rereview
this
one
if
i
have
it
again
but
probably
not
until
i
run
into
it
on
tap
medium
mouthfeel
with
nearly
no
notice
of
the
alcohol
at
all
this
a
a
superb
brew
highly
recommend
overall
i
am
not
worthy
to
pass
judgement
on
this
masterpiece
dangerously
expensive
and
incredibly
delicious
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
i
have
only
had
one
or
two
biere
de
gardes
before
this
and
well
i
dont
remember
them
tasting
anything
like
this
this
is
quite
a
good
beer
and
jolly
pumpkin
continues
to
impress
me
with
their
rustic
style
ales
certainly
worth
a
try
cheers
overall
a
really
nice
brew
good
balance
of
bright
fruit
earthy
yeast
and
sour
characters
although
its
only
my
second
jolly
pumpkin
from
what
ive
gathered
it
seems
like
a
great
intro
to
the
brewery
as
well
as
the
sour
style
pours
a
hazy
yellowishorange
colour
with
thick
white
head
head
dissipates
fairly
quickly
smells
quite
tart
and
funky
almost
like
a
wild
ale
aroma
of
apple
and
pear
with
the
yeasty
smell
flavour
is
fairly
sour
but
not
full
on
sour
either
big
carbonation
level
im
enjoying
all
the
jolly
pumpkin
beers
ive
tried
im
glad
i
picked
up
every
one
i
saw
in
michigan
on
my
recent
trip
drinks
very
well
this
is
a
very
tasty
beer
i
am
not
sure
why
it
took
me
so
long
to
pick
this
one
up
but
i
am
happy
that
i
did
tremendous
range
in
flavors
which
are
layered
very
well
keeps
your
interest
from
glass
to
glass
very
easy
to
drink
while
a
bit
higher
in
alcohol
than
many
of
the
others
in
jps
line
up
it
never
becomes
a
factor
when
enjoying
the
beer
would
make
an
excellent
gateway
beer
into
the
bière
de
garde
style
d
i
feel
like
this
one
may
have
been
slightly
past
its
prime
the
carbonation
was
out
of
whack
however
the
flavors
remained
intact
luckily
making
for
a
good
experience
id
like
to
buy
a
fresher
batch
and
compare
it
with
this
perhaps
the
carbonation
was
intended
which
in
that
case
i
wouldve
rated
it
higher
for
i
am
always
game
for
new
takes
on
certain
styles
otherwise
i
just
feel
its
off
for
a
biere
de
garde
taste
slightly
bitter
thick
tiny
element
of
clove
to
it
mouthfeel
reveals
lots
of
carbonation
to
this
beer
maybe
a
little
bit
of
black
pepper
to
it
a
slight
bit
of
tart
to
it
overall
i
enjoy
this
one
its
a
perfect
beer
for
this
time
of
year
its
got
some
tartness
but
isnt
really
a
sour
as
much
as
it
is
a
golden
ale
with
some
sour
notes
liked
it
similar
to
a
gueuze
in
my
opinion
would
love
to
try
to
age
one
of
these
things
simply
put
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
and
shall
be
consumed
in
short
order
the
closest
comparison
i
can
muster
is
duvel
which
is
strange
because
the
two
are
quite
different
it
is
rather
pleasant
to
drink
owing
to
its
complexity
derived
from
care
and
attention
not
massive
hop
additions
like
so
many
other
8
small
brewery
batches
highly
recommended
overall
not
bad
not
bad
at
all
it
isnt
really
sour
enough
to
be
a
good
sour
but
it
drinks
easily
nonetheless
d
id
drink
it
again
but
not
tonight
the
tap
list
is
too
interesting
ill
try
it
again
from
a
bottle
someday
d
very
good
drinkability
is
great
if
i
could
get
this
at
my
local
shop
750
ml
bottle
batch
585
bottled
72710
served
in
a
tulip
the
beer
pours
a
somewhat
hazy
light
gold
color
with
about
an
inch
white
head
head
retention
and
lacing
are
both
good
aroma
is
tart
and
a
bit
of
sweet
peaches
lemon
peel
peppery
spice
and
some
funk
and
oak
the
brew
tastes
like
lemon
peel
peppery
spice
yeast
funk
green
apples
and
a
slight
minerallybitter
flavor
that
doesnt
seem
to
fit
this
brew
at
all
mouthfeelbody
is
lightmedium
it
finishes
dry
and
is
well
carbonated
drinkability
is
ok
i
thought
this
was
a
decent
enough
brew
but
there
are
other
beers
from
jolly
pumpkin
that
i
like
more
than
this
one
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
pretty
massive
head
that
retains
nicely
and
leaves
a
beautiful
lacing
the
aroma
is
heavy
with
a
yeastysoapy
note
and
a
hint
of
lemon
the
flavor
reveals
notes
of
green
apple
melon
and
honey
practically
no
hop
presence
a
great
bottle
for
a
warm
summer
night
overall
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
my
complaint
is
that
it
doesnt
seem
to
fit
the
style
in
my
opinion
i
was
expecting
a
bit
more
earthiness
and
heavier
malt
character
this
beer
seems
like
a
cross
between
a
flemish
sour
red
and
a
saison
maybe
in
that
it
was
disappointing
masks
the
8
abv
quite
well
it
is
easy
to
drink
i
would
have
it
again
but
not
my
first
choice
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
dry
but
has
plenty
of
body
to
it
overall
this
is
another
excellant
offering
from
jolly
pumpkin
loaded
with
lots
of
complex
flavors
that
all
seem
to
fit
so
well
together
this
is
my
first
beer
of
this
variety
i
really
like
it
totally
new
tastes
if
you
are
looking
for
a
new
style
of
beer
to
try
give
it
a
shot
got
it
from
the
3
discontinued
bin
at
my
stony
brook
hy
vee
spirit
shop
headed
back
right
now
to
buy
the
remainder
they
have
pours
a
pale
yet
bright
gold
lightly
gazed
active
carbonation
head
of
thousands
of
tiny
bubbles
good
retention
for
style
scent
is
a
great
mix
of
barnyard
funk
combined
with
freshly
dried
hay
earth
lemongrass
tart
fruit
light
sugar
taste
brings
components
of
scent
together
wonderfully
much
more
aggressive
than
bottled
version
with
more
pronounced
flavors
more
tart
in
this
version
with
a
touch
less
funk
may
have
someone
to
do
with
age
nice
lighter
side
of
medium
bodied
spritzy
at
first
but
carbonation
levels
decently
dry
more
aggressive
flavors
and
increased
tartness
and
balanced
funk
make
this
draft
version
superior
to
bottle
color
is
a
beautiful
cloudy
straw
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
its
well
carbonated
and
leaves
the
mouth
puckering
a
little
after
each
sip
very
drinkable
drinkability
is
awesome
id
highly
recommend
pairing
this
beer
with
any
light
appetizer
fish
dish
or
lemony
dessert
golden
with
a
very
slight
haze
fair
head
retention
aroma
of
sour
cherries
and
a
bit
of
malt
very
well
balanced
up
front
with
both
sour
and
sweet
vying
for
equal
billing
slight
bitterness
appear
in
the
middle
and
gradually
builds
sticking
around
after
the
finish
light
body
this
is
a
pleasant
beer
i
would
not
go
out
of
my
way
however
if
this
were
around
i
would
drink
one
or
two
d
too
much
funk
for
me
so
tart
it
made
me
pucker
and
i
could
not
recover
enough
to
enjoy
it
the
way
most
seem
to
d
oro
de
calabaza
is
complex
it
is
multidimensional
and
most
importantly
it
is
one
delicious
endlessly
drinkable
beer
poured
a
nice
straw
color
with
a
good
size
head
nose
is
a
bit
floral
nothiing
overpowering
carbonation
was
moderate
to
light
if
i
had
to
pick
a
fruit
its
sour
apples
more
than
anything
up
front
nice
mouthfeel
packs
a
bit
of
a
punch
as
someone
else
noted
its
almost
like
a
white
wine
as
a
sour
fan
i
approve
light
pale
straw
color
very
translucent
but
with
a
slight
haze
to
it
thin
white
head
at
pour
settling
to
a
clean
white
ring
around
edge
of
glass
very
light
bitter
aroma
big
musty
earthiness
and
hit
of
leather
to
aroma
as
well
smells
dry
as
well
moderate
carbonation
but
decreases
a
little
quickly
very
tart
all
the
way
through
flavors
of
apple
and
bright
citrus
and
fruity
overall
reminds
me
of
a
slightly
dry
white
wine
has
dry
finish
with
tart
green
apple
like
flavor
to
finish
light
mouthfeel
very
clean
and
drinkable
flavors
abs
aromas
blend
together
nicely
d
this
was
a
super
complex
and
rich
and
puckering
beer
with
great
scent
and
flavor
combinations
that
stimulate
the
entire
tongue
it
had
a
nice
viscous
body
with
well
hidden
alcohol
so
it
wasnt
difficult
to
drink
but
i
really
took
my
time
with
this
beer
to
fully
enjoy
it
a
lovely
drink
that
clearly
shows
mastery
of
brewing
i
dug
it
and
found
that
the
sips
started
big
but
as
i
got
further
thru
the
bottle
they
got
smaller
an
smaller
it
is
a
volume
issue
nothing
you
could
session
but
something
that
should
be
shared
pretty
darn
good
beer
a
real
drinker
for
its
weight
and
would
go
pleasantly
with
many
food
choices
somehow
both
big
and
funky
but
also
accessible
overall
a
very
solid
brew
it
includes
the
classic
jolly
pumpkin
funk
i
would
guess
this
is
5abv
very
easy
to
drink
and
with
a
great
prickly
mouthfeel
solid
offering
poured
a
hazy
pineapple
yellow
with
pale
yellow
highlights
that
had
a
half
finger
of
head
a
left
good
bubbly
lacing
sticking
to
the
glass
the
aroma
had
the
signature
barnyard
horse
den
funkiness
with
citrus
slight
oakiness
from
the
barrels
and
tangerine
apricots
notes
the
citrusy
apricot
flavors
really
pop
out
more
on
the
palate
with
the
funky
oaky
character
and
sllight
acidic
tart
notes
the
beer
was
medium
in
body
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
which
had
a
tart
sweet
citrusy
funky
sour
and
a
mild
dry
finish
it
drank
really
good
and
was
a
great
brew
to
cap
off
the
night
jolly
pumpkin
really
makes
some
intresting
beers
for
sure
this
is
what
a
tartfunky
beer
should
taste
like
not
as
out
there
as
orval
but
not
as
sweet
and
lame
as
lindemans
definitely
want
to
try
more
from
this
brewery
d
in
my
opinion
a
very
easy
funky
sour
beer
to
drink
the
sweetness
can
be
somewhat
off
putting
but
i
found
myself
continually
reaching
for
this
beer
highly
recommended
d
i
would
repeat
this
jp
biere
as
often
as
possible
murky
orange
in
body
topped
by
white
bubbly
head
that
leaves
pretty
lacing
down
the
sides
of
my
glass
aroma
of
sour
citrus
lemon
spices
light
fruit
tastes
of
sourness
citrus
lemon
candied
apples
spices
exotic
fruit
lively
mouthfeel
with
intense
carbonation
refreshingly
pleasant
a
beautiful
fruity
drink
bottled
72710
a
well
crafted
beer
it
just
lacks
the
oomph
that
i
was
expecting
other
that
that
its
perfect
the
balance
almost
makes
up
for
the
lack
of
oomph
ill
be
seeking
this
one
out
again
and
again
dsuper
springsummer
easy
drinker
very
enjoyable
because
of
its
bright
finish
this
has
been
a
real
hit
to
my
friends
who
are
not
keen
beer
drinkers
add
a
lemon
twist
for
those
seeking
an
bigger
citrus
flavor
d
very
good
sipper
from
jp
one
of
their
better
brews
in
my
opinion
easily
one
of
my
favorites
of
the
bière
de
garde
style
pours
a
strawyellow
color
with
a
good
white
head
a
bit
of
lacing
the
is
some
light
grain
and
straw
with
a
good
amount
of
funk
and
a
slight
dose
of
sourness
there
is
really
great
notes
of
straw
and
barnyard
the
taste
is
the
same
as
there
is
just
a
light
malt
character
and
a
really
nose
dose
of
hay
and
blanket
feel
is
really
fantastic
between
the
funk
and
some
slight
sourness
drinks
really
well
and
is
a
fantastic
offering
from
jp
d
the
easiest
drinking
8
beer
i
have
probably
ever
had
lots
of
flavors
that
blend
very
well
together
very
refreshing
and
easy
to
put
down
this
is
definitely
an
artisan
ale
d
very
enjoyable
at
first
but
after
awhile
it
became
kind
of
one
note
funky
its
balanced
but
no
real
sweetness
to
counter
the
tartness
became
a
bit
overwhelming
and
dropped
the
drinkability
for
me
a
bit
i
did
like
the
lemon
notes
once
i
picked
out
that
flavor
but
it
also
made
it
seem
kind
of
acidic
id
recommend
sharing
this
one
a
bottle
to
myself
was
too
much
d
if
youre
into
wild
brettinoculated
beers
this
ones
great
its
sour
but
not
overwhelmingly
so
and
funky
but
wellbalanced
again
the
styles
not
everyones
cup
of
tea
but
this
is
a
fine
beer
and
relatively
true
to
style
d
even
as
it
warms
the
three
distinct
flavor
busts
continue
to
hit
you
it
never
stops
the
feeling
of
being
awake
and
alive
is
constant
it
is
almost
too
much
almost
lovely
d
high
i
would
buy
this
one
again
and
probably
order
a
second
glass
the
alcohol
is
getting
to
me
though
m
way
way
too
carbonated
it
expands
in
your
mouth
like
metis
mentos
and
diet
coke
the
light
dry
body
only
makes
this
effect
seem
worse
d
this
is
tasty
and
will
satisfy
the
sour
beer
craving
but
it
is
not
something
i
would
do
a
lot
of
just
exceptional
incredibly
nuanced
and
complex
at
the
same
time
oh
man
i
need
to
get
more
of
this
very
highly
recommend
d
a
very
nice
biere
de
garde
lots
of
sour
fruit
in
the
smell
and
taste
would
like
to
try
again
d
not
a
big
fan
of
biere
de
gardes
but
the
brett
really
adds
a
nice
touch
bottom
line
this
gets
high
marks
from
me
as
the
older
bottles
were
straight
up
awesome
and
basically
perfectly
done
notes
interesting
and
complex
beer
with
plenty
of
general
fruity
flavors
somewhat
tart
and
funky
but
not
a
sour
oak
provides
a
nice
background
taste
as
well
overall
an
nice
beer
to
try
and
an
interesting
one
to
drink
but
for
the
cost
i
dont
know
if
i
will
necessarily
go
out
and
grab
another
soon
drinkability
a
nice
drinking
brew
enjoying
on
a
hot
evening
as
an
after
dinner
treat
and
fits
the
bill
perfectly
a
nice
unique
and
complex
beer
that
i
would
like
to
try
again
notes
tastes
like
a
tripel
infected
with
brett
and
aged
with
mango
puree
the
alcohol
is
undetectable
love
it
d
a
little
sweet
for
my
tastes
but
a
light
complex
beer
that
hit
the
spot
on
a
very
hot
summer
day
o
i
love
this
beer
and
i
rated
it
pretty
highly
although
i
feel
that
age
adds
an
extremely
huge
amount
of
flavor
the
nose
and
taste
are
magnified
almost
more
tenfold
and
this
beer
becomes
extremely
sour
i
intend
to
review
this
beer
again
next
time
i
open
an
aged
bottle
drinkability
this
is
a
slowdrinking
ale
that
is
great
to
share
with
a
friend
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
carbonation
is
above
average
drinkability
is
good
i
really
liked
it
i
liked
the
sourness
it
had
added
with
the
fruity
tartness
and
sweet
bready
malt
all
together
it
was
a
very
tasty
and
drinkable
beer
with
a
lot
of
complex
flavors
thank
you
jolly
pumpkin
for
channeling
this
bit
of
vitality
an
interesting
and
easy
drinking
beer
after
my
first
experience
i
was
really
expecting
another
overthetop
experience
but
this
is
really
like
drinking
a
well
built
farmhouse
ale
with
a
touch
of
oak
a
wild
yeast
good
stuff
ideas
from
fellow
taster
almost
no
head
to
speak
of
a
thin
ring
of
fuzz
around
the
edge
of
the
glass
no
visible
carbonation
in
light
straw
yellow
hazy
body
which
didnt
clear
after
warming
nose
features
a
big
hit
of
de
funk
some
nuanced
oakiness
not
overpowering
tart
dry
aroma
some
coriander
and
lemony
esters
lemon
became
more
pronounced
as
it
warmed
taste
is
fairly
fruity
may
be
attributable
in
part
to
the
oak
lemony
nose
taste
like
they
used
dupont
yeast
in
this
a
very
complex
flavor
profile
imho
not
sure
this
is
a
first
use
oak
barrel
nice
subtle
oakiness
more
saisony
than
bier
de
garde
due
to
yeast
medium
light
mouthfeel
lip
smacking
tartness
dry
attenuated
finish
more
tart
than
sour
alcohol
is
fairly
noticeable
thanks
maltmaster
420
for
doing
the
legwork
and
bringing
this
to
oregon
will
be
looking
to
obtain
a
bottled
version
of
this
for
comparison
this
is
my
first
of
the
style
so
i
do
not
have
any
reference
points
pours
a
cloudy
light
yellow
with
a
sizeable
head
nose
is
awesome
oak
lemon
funk
pinot
sour
candy
and
some
sweetness
taste
is
complex
with
oak
chalk
lime
and
lemon
peel
first
then
yeast
and
funk
and
some
sourness
510
on
the
pucker
meter
with
a
nice
dry
finish
and
a
pinch
of
alcohol
lovely
beer
d
very
refreshing
and
a
really
great
beer
for
what
was
a
hot
summer
day
at
lunch
i
was
very
impressed
with
this
one
and
was
hoping
to
track
down
some
more
to
hold
onto
pours
an
extremely
murky
honeygold
color
with
about
an
inch
of
white
fizzy
head
not
very
frothy
the
scent
is
not
what
i
was
expecting
from
the
description
on
the
bottle
there
is
definitely
a
sour
smell
to
this
ale
along
with
a
bit
of
barnyard
funk
also
picking
up
some
lemons
with
a
bit
of
zest
and
spices
very
nice
smell
to
this
very
interesting
taste
as
well
never
had
anything
like
this
before
initially
i
get
a
sour
taste
along
with
some
herbs
and
spices
pepper
oregano
mint
etc
then
i
get
some
very
strong
woody
notes
followed
by
lemon
and
maybe
a
bit
of
orange
kinda
a
bit
of
alcohol
taste
at
the
end
the
sourness
is
not
overpowering
at
all
in
fact
it
makes
this
beer
better
i
just
havent
had
a
biere
de
garde
this
sour
before
then
again
i
havent
had
very
many
of
that
style
the
taste
seems
to
get
better
as
it
warms
up
the
mouthfeel
is
very
nice
not
too
light
and
very
crisp
and
refreshing
still
fullbodied
decent
drinkability
as
i
can
easily
drink
the
whole
bomber
of
this
although
i
dont
think
i
could
drink
more
than
that
in
one
sitting
this
is
an
enjoyable
beer
to
drink
very
refreshing
will
satisfy
a
hot
summer
thirst
but
might
also
go
well
with
a
sweet
apple
pie
oro
de
calanaza
pours
golden
and
crisp
until
you
come
to
a
hidden
treasure
at
the
bottom
there
is
a
great
deal
of
sediment
lurking
it
the
depths
that
changes
the
bright
finish
into
a
wheaty
masterpiece
a
think
creamy
head
is
seen
throughout
drinking
but
very
prevalent
at
first
a
first
taste
reveals
slight
bananacitrusclove
notes
with
hearty
wheat
presence
the
back
end
provides
a
slightly
oaky
finish
that
mingles
with
the
rest
of
the
pallet
but
doesnt
take
over
it
cold
be
easy
to
overpower
this
style
of
beer
with
too
much
cask
and
not
enough
good
old
beer
flavor
luckily
the
blend
is
perfect
the
flavors
meld
together
complimenting
not
fighting
for
superiority
the
flavors
are
more
subdued
and
reminiscent
of
themselves
vs
a
strong
separate
character
overall
the
flavors
all
blend
and
compliment
each
other
to
provide
a
complex
yet
highly
drinkable
beer
with
a
nice
abu
punch
to
boot
d
when
i
was
done
with
the
first
pour
in
a
pint
i
had
a
second
pour
unfortunately
that
was
all
that
was
brought
to
the
tasting
or
else
there
would
have
been
a
third
pour
wonderful
been
hanging
onto
this
one
for
awhile
22
ounce
bomber
pour
is
a
beautiful
with
a
nice
golden
amber
color
topped
by
a
soft
full
1
head
first
aroma
is
very
sour
with
an
oak
presence
followed
by
banana
bread
with
some
pineapple
atypical
of
belgian
style
beers
reminds
me
of
boulevards
saisonbrett
at
least
in
the
nose
very
spicy
both
at
the
front
and
the
end
the
oak
in
the
front
and
the
high
abv
lending
notes
of
pepper
to
the
end
in
between
the
beer
is
very
sweet
with
a
very
large
mouthfeel
provided
by
the
heavy
belgian
yeast
the
finish
lingers
reminding
me
of
sweet
tarts
which
i
havent
had
since
i
was
a
kid
surprisingly
drinkable
very
well
put
together
beer
oro
de
calabeza
reminds
me
of
fourth
of
july
fireworks
it
starts
out
slowly
hits
you
with
a
surprise
and
then
leaves
you
wanting
more
it
is
truly
a
winner
all
in
all
a
truly
fantastic
beer
and
one
i
will
have
around
a
lot
more
probably
could
use
some
more
aging
like
the
sourness
like
the
dry
peppery
tastesmell
like
the
funk
dont
care
for
so
much
of
the
cidery
taste
or
the
bitterness
the
carbonation
is
very
good
and
the
beer
is
nicely
crisp
but
its
a
bit
on
the
thin
side
in
terms
of
body
as
for
drinkability
theres
a
definitely
noticeable
alcohol
sting
in
the
tail
but
the
flavour
keeps
you
wanting
another
sip
as
the
bottle
goes
on
if
the
body
was
a
little
bit
fuller
it
would
be
perfectly
satisfying
but
i
got
a
bit
tired
of
drinking
it
eventually
very
thin
bodied
and
fairly
low
in
carbonation
not
sure
if
it
was
supposed
to
be
this
way
though
i
assume
monks
had
it
on
the
right
amount
of
carb
a
very
easy
to
drink
funky
beer
my
first
jolly
pumpkin
i
really
enjoyed
it
mildly
sour
tasting
and
quite
wild
but
has
a
strong
resemblance
to
a
belgian
golden
ale
with
the
light
grainy
malts
biere
de
garde
not
really
i
think
it
fits
better
as
a
belgian
golden
ale
a
thirst
quenching
one
at
that
little
bit
of
hops
on
the
finish
not
overly
complex
but
what
is
there
is
really
nice
the
wood
from
the
barrels
does
not
show
itself
a
whole
lot
lemony
and
refreshing
not
overdone
very
nice
and
well
crafted
beer
might
not
be
my
favorite
jp
offering
but
it
is
damn
tasty
this
is
a
very
nice
belgian
ale
with
a
lot
of
great
qualities
but
i
wouldnt
rate
it
quite
so
highly
as
the
famed
mr
asimov
its
the
best
biere
de
garde
ive
had
but
then
again
i
havent
had
that
many
biere
de
gardes
drinkability
not
my
favorite
sour
but
a
very
interesting
beer
that
is
well
worth
seeking
out
d
awesome
this
one
is
very
smooth
and
is
great
for
pairing
with
food
overall
impression
the
funk
is
very
well
integrated
into
this
beer
good
stuff
drinkability
probably
perfectly
fine
for
the
style
but
not
a
beer
i
would
have
multiples
of
d
for
an
8
beer
the
alcohol
is
not
very
noticable
however
the
sour
taste
limits
its
drinkability
somewhat
drinkability
a
very
funky
and
good
beer
i
like
the
citrus
tones
in
this
one
not
sure
if
i
would
pick
it
up
again
but
i
would
not
pass
over
it
batch
number
not
in
notes
pours
a
clear
golden
color
15
inch
head
of
a
white
color
poor
retention
and
poor
lacing
smells
of
tart
malt
yeast
oak
alcohol
and
slight
hop
fits
the
style
of
a
biere
de
garde
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
there
is
also
a
noticeable
tartness
tastes
of
oak
aged
alcohol
tart
malt
yeast
slight
pale
hop
and
citrus
overall
i
like
the
combination
of
the
tartness
and
the
oak
aged
alcohol
one
of
the
better
blends
ive
had
that
incorporated
oak
aged
alcohol
very
good
beer
in
the
sourbelgian
style
id
definitely
have
another
i
wont
say
that
the
beer
i
just
drank
completely
made
up
for
the
loss
of
over
half
my
bottle
but
it
helped
my
first
from
jolly
pumpkin
and
it
definitely
wont
be
my
last
drinkability
good
light
refreshing
drinkability
goes
down
easy
enough
but
no
reason
to
finish
this
one
or
seek
it
out
again
i
was
hoping
for
some
sour
tart
and
funk
none
to
be
found
massive
rocky
head
lots
of
streamers
lovely
aroma
of
cinnamon
and
maybe
some
lacticpineapple
notes
an
odd
combination
for
sure
but
it
works
delicately
fruity
thinking
tropical
fruits
but
maybe
some
granny
smith
apple
at
first
then
powerfully
tart
some
bits
of
tannin
nip
at
the
tongue
from
the
id
imagine
but
not
in
a
bad
way
quite
dry
some
bits
of
lace
stick
to
the
side
of
the
glass
i
dont
know
that
id
call
this
biere
de
garde
probably
more
along
the
lines
of
what
a
saison
from
a
small
farmhouse
brewery
tasted
like
60
or
70
years
ago
d
already
wishing
we
had
another
bottle
for
this
tasting
wonderful
example
that
well
be
returning
to
again
very
soon
j
refreshing
but
perhaps
better
appreciated
as
part
of
a
good
meal
than
on
its
own
taste
of
oak
through
the
roof
not
quite
as
prominent
as
la
roja
was
in
blowing
the
roof
off
of
oak
but
the
oak
is
definitely
there
and
in
your
face
there
is
a
pear
tart
citrus
essence
that
is
the
bulk
of
the
flavors
behind
the
extreme
tartness
high
carbonation
and
a
thicker
than
i
was
expecting
mouthfeel
of
the
wild
ales
i
have
had
this
one
comes
close
to
having
the
thickest
body
that
i
have
had
yet
compared
to
all
of
the
russian
river
sours
which
i
tend
to
enjoy
more
and
think
are
more
balanced
this
one
stands
out
as
being
a
little
more
cloudy
and
with
more
body
drinkability
is
hurt
some
by
the
thick
oak
flavors
which
tend
to
be
present
in
all
jp
brews
that
i
have
had
the
new
york
times
really
knew
what
they
were
thinking
when
they
chose
this
as
the
best
belgium
ale
d
drinkable
as
hell
but
at
the
price
ill
try
others
before
revisiting
the
body
is
medium
and
carbonation
is
high
but
nice
and
soft
drinkability
is
decent
but
im
not
sure
this
one
has
enough
good
flavor
to
justify
the
high
abv
so
i
dont
think
i
would
purchase
it
again
still
a
nice
beer
overall
a
really
nice
beer
big
bold
flavors
with
enough
carbonation
to
keep
everything
crisp
very
champagne
like
i
loved
it
d
after
initially
tasting
jolly
pumpkin
beers
my
palate
has
opened
up
to
the
sour
and
funk
that
is
a
part
of
their
brews
this
is
very
well
balanced
not
too
sour
or
too
tart
it
goes
back
and
forth
in
the
flavoring
very
tasty
goes
down
extremely
easy
will
pick
up
another
bottle
of
this
to
enjoy
on
a
hot
new
england
day
mouthfeel
is
mediumfull
with
a
smooth
amount
of
carbonation
not
bad
taste
was
a
little
too
dry
for
me
didnt
live
up
to
the
smell
medium
body
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
alcohol
wasnt
really
noticeable
so
this
was
very
drinkable
overall
very
enjoyable
and
at
the
price
was
a
great
deal
cheers
d
a
very
fine
beer
that
pairs
especially
well
with
lighter
foods
this
would
be
one
to
give
to
the
reluctant
wine
drinker
pours
a
light
gold
color
with
a
white
filmy
head
aroma
is
lightly
tart
with
some
citric
notes
including
oranges
also
some
marzipan
maltiness
and
pepper
flavor
offers
much
less
thin
and
watery
the
mild
esters
and
earthy
funk
dont
come
together
very
well
in
the
finish
seems
a
bit
jumbled
some
random
spices
and
bretty
notes
astringent
on
the
palate
ddrinkability
is
only
hindered
by
the
bubbles
if
you
can
burp
through
it
its
delicious
and
subtle
enough
to
session
just
dont
drive
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
the
drinkability
is
great
complex
flavors
make
for
a
smooth
drinking
beer
thanks
for
sharing

slight

sour
flavours
in
the
finish
wow
this
is
great
i
could
definitely
see
myself
picking
up
another
bottle
of
this
notes
maybe
not
the
over
the
top
hype
i
heard
from
some
quarters
surrounding
this
brew
but
it
is
not
far
from
it
it
is
actually
very
rich
complex
and
works
very
well
id
love
to
have
it
around
more
often
this
batch
is
ok
an
approachable
example
but
ive
enjoyed
it
more
in
the
past
d
my
first
funked
beer
to
date
split
the
bottle
with
a
friend
but
very
refreshing
beer
a
very
nice
beer
and
another
subtly
crafted
brew
from
the
good
people
at
jolly
pumpkin
it
grew
on
me
a
lot
the
more
i
drank
which
speaks
to
its
drinkability
while
it
didnt
bowl
me
over
with
raw
robust
character
it
impressed
me
with
its
subtlety
and
finesse
quite
excellent
a
very
enjoyable
beer
with
good
flavour
well
handled
and
well
constructed
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
because
it
has
a
lot
to
offer
however
i
think
the
brewers
are
correct
the
beer
should
be
aged
im
going
to
buy
another
one
and
let
it
sit
for
a
year
or
two
and
see
if
im
correct
in
this
opinion
o
this
beer
is
playful
with
its
spice
and
pepper
notes
they
dont
seem
to
be
artificial
or
overpowering
wonderful
balanced
sour
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
light
for
the
abv
theres
little
alcohol
presence
its
an
altogether
pleasing
beer
and
my
favorite
thus
far
from
jolly
pumpkin
this
beers
is
a
strong
golden
aged
in
oak
from
dexter
michigan
they
call
it
a
biere
de
garde
a
style
from
france
near
the
belgian
border
very
crisp
and
aromatic
reminiscent
of
pepper
hay
and
a
little
of
barnyard
this
beer
is
very
complex
but
ends
up
dry
and
and
slightly
tart
almost
a
champagne
like
quality
to
it
excellent
beer
that
mystifies
style
boundaries
im
nicely
impressed
with
this
biere
de
garde
and
its
certainly
the
best
example
ive
had
so
far
that
said
i
cant
help
but
feel
that
this
style
is
not
for
me
for
while
this
is
the
top
ranked
example
on
ba
it
didnt
go
so
far
as
to
wow
me
perhaps
im
the
only
guy
out
there
who
wished
jolly
pumpkin
used
more
funk
d
a
beer
of
this
quality
and
sophistication
must
qualify
as
quite
drinkable
like
all
other
jolly
pumpkins
this
follows
true
artisan
styles
by
being
very
crisp
aromatic
and
slightly
dry
upon
first
sample
and
it
was
my
first
ever
artisan
beer
i
thought
the
owner
of
the
bottle
told
me
wrong
as
i
thought
it
could
possibly
have
been
a
chardonay
very
bubbly
and
dry
on
your
tounge
not
bad
overall
not
a
great
sour
another
tasty
sour
offering
from
jolly
pumpkin
golden
color
with
a
nice
head
and
good
lacing
flavors
and
aromas
are
citrus
lemon
and
orange
strong
sourness
and
maybe
a
touch
of
apples
some
earthiness
definite
peppers
and
some
lighter
yeast
and
wheat
nice
if
not
something
id
drink
every
day
cause
of
the
sourness
busy
carbonation
and
a
medium
to
light
body
that
fits
the
style
well
definitely
a
solid
change
of
pace
though
this
is
a
fantastic
and
complex
belgian
ale
from
jp
with
the
tartness
and
funkiness
really
coming
out
i
think
this
one
has
picked
up
some
character
over
the
2
years
since
it
was
brewed
great
stuff
d
no
problem
finishing
this
actually
went
nicely
with
my
half
a
burger
lola
fries
and
sirachi
wings
good
straight
across
the
board
nothing
stands
out
taste
is
very
bubbly
and
lemon
with
some
spice
and
funk
thrown
in
finish
is
dry
i
found
this
beer
to
be
true
to
style
but
not
very
enjoyable
to
me
i
dont
like
really
dry
beers
d
comes
in
at
8
but
youd
hardly
know
it
well
until
youve
finished
your
bottle
i
love
that
little
sour
kick
makes
me
keep
wanting
more
lovely
beer
very
happy
i
finally
came
across
it
this
is
a
nice
beer
and
a
pretty
good
garde
however
it
seems
a
little
overthetop
in
some
ways
especially
in
spiciness
might
prefer
it
more
if
it
were
just
a
tad
more
mellow
still
ill
happily
polish
off
the
bottle
although
this
beer
finishes
with
a
bitter
and
almost
skunky
taste
and
seems
very
much
like
a
cider
it
is
very
enjoyable
and
provides
such
an
assortment
of
flavors
and
sensations
that
i
must
highly
recommend
this
beer
the
flavor
was
pretty
good
but
the
overall
drinking
sipping
and
savoring
experience
of
it
was
excellent
pick
one
up
and
enjoy
the
ride
this
beer
somehow
works
a
nice
beer
balance
and
after
one
25
oz
bottle
i
was
feeling
a
really
good
buzz
and
in
a
great
mood
cheers
review
from
notes
taken
on
111109
overall
subtle
and
elegant
with
enough
funkyness
to
keep
you
wanting
d
one
is
more
than
enough
for
me
a
nice
drinking
and
sipping
beer
d
awesome
any
belgian
style
beer
enthusiast
must
try
i
feel
this
is
the
flag
ship
beer
for
jolly
pumpkin
d
i
could
do
this
dance
all
night
drinkability
very
much
so
this
is
going
to
be
a
very
enjoyable
beer
it
almost
makes
me
glad
my
fiancée
does
not
like
beer
that
way
i
get
this
whole
bottle
to
myself
tonight
i
need
to
do
a
side
by
side
comparison
test
of
this
versus
la
roja
which
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
previously
i
feel
like
la
roja
had
more
of
a
bite
and
this
brew
is
a
bit
more
refined
overall
i
am
glad
i
have
another
in
my
collection
and
cant
wait
to
partake
in
this
again
this
beer
is
just
not
my
thing
i
kinda
forgot
how
jp
beers
have
the
tendency
to
foam
out
of
control
then
take
forever
to
settle
in
the
glass
oh
well
this
is
big
spicy
beer
with
tons
of
fruit
and
yeast
and
carbonation
all
combined
it
takes
about
half
a
glass
to
get
a
real
grip
on
the
complexity
and
the
barrel
aging
i
like
this
beer
but
it
seems
a
difficult
one
to
pin
down
as
the
spiciness
and
the
live
mouthfeel
sometimes
overwhelm
the
palate
d
fairly
easy
to
drink
but
the
booze
is
a
little
strong
nice
beer
and
extremely
complex
lots
of
things
going
on
but
it
just
isnt
really
incredibly
flavorful
id
definitely
recommend
it
if
youre
looking
for
a
sour
fix
procured
at
whole
foods
valencia
ca
very
interesting
and
unique
flavors
going
on
here
nice
earthy
oak
funkiness
with
quite
a
bit
of
vanilla
character
lots
of
citrus
peel
and
grapefruit
possibly
some
lighter
crsip
fruit
notes
apple
there
is
a
nice
hop
presence
as
well
providing
a
bitterness
that
balances
thins
out
pretty
well
and
a
dry
finish
final
thoughts
if
you
like
sours
or
are
just
starting
to
get
into
sours
this
is
a
great
beer
the
oak
is
very
light
and
barely
noticeable
compared
to
other
oaked
beers
its
got
a
wild
belgian
yeast
quality
as
well
thats
actually
kinda
nice
its
not
really
easy
to
drink
because
of
the
sour
qild
yeast
but
otherwise
its
pretty
good
especially
for
a
summer
beer
d
a
hard
one
to
figure
i
want
to
say
good
because
it
has
its
own
taste
which
is
quite
overwhelming
maybe
a
bit
much
over
the
top
biere
de
garde
is
the
wrong
description
maybe
a
sour
or
belgian
wild
would
be
more
acceptable
im
enjoying
this
beer
but
not
picking
up
on
some
on
the
great
characteristics
ive
read
about
it
i
think
my
bottle
may
have
been
skunked
through
temperature
fluctuation
if
so
its
still
great
and
ill
be
trying
it
again
soon
for
my
tastes
and
trying
to
be
true
to
the
style
this
beer
is
a
bit
too
sour
for
me
and
lacking
the
necessary
pepper
malt
to
balance
the
sour
yeast
improves
as
it
warms
as
the
spice
comes
out
certainly
worth
a
try
overall
this
is
one
of
the
better
beers
i
have
had
on
the
night
i
love
the
oak
and
the
brett
the
flavors
complement
each
other
well
i
can
easily
drink
a
lot
of
this
pours
a
bright
golden
yellow
with
a
nice
frothy
head
that
recedes
slowly
it
has
a
great
floral
smell
and
sweet
notes
from
the
belgian
hops
the
taste
is
very
unique
with
a
spicey
and
peppery
bite
for
me
the
pepper
is
a
bit
overwhelming
and
i
have
to
admit
almost
mad
me
ill
the
mouthfeel
is
good
and
if
i
was
more
of
a
pepper
fan
would
enjoy
this
beer
as
much
as
my
buddy
that
i
split
it
with
this
is
still
a
great
quality
beer
d
my
tastes
must
have
changed
i
love
this
beer
more
than
i
did
i
feel
like
its
not
that
easy
to
drink
and
yet
i
keep
going
back
for
more
just
to
experience
it
again
pretty
damn
drinkable
for
me
and
the
alcohol
is
very
hidden
by
the
complexities
of
this
beer
solid
offering
d
very
pleasant
and
enjoyable
with
lots
of
complimentary
flavors
though
begins
to
warm
as
you
get
into
it
overall
a
wonderful
belgian
golden
ale
notes
i
had
a
huge
gusher
when
i
opened
this
and
lost
a
lot
of
it
i
had
just
brought
it
home
from
the
store
but
there
was
no
rough
handling
still
my
favorite
jolly
pumpkin
product
ive
tired
fresh
75cl
bottle
from
batch
326
no
gushing
problems
pours
a
very
hazy
gold
with
a
towering
rocky
white
head
smells
citric
and
acidic
with
some
apple
and
definite
musty
barnyard
notes
from
brett
the
taste
is
initially
tart
and
lemony
but
this
is
quickly
followed
by
an
oaken
earthy
character
musty
brett
notes
again
with
hops
giving
it
a
slightly
bitter
very
dry
finish
the
alcohol
is
noticeable
in
the
background
though
barely
save
for
the
warming
finish
full
body
with
good
carbonation
a
really
nice
complex
beer
that
should
be
even
better
in
a
year
or
so
as
the
alcohol
dies
down
i
really
like
this
beer
and
only
wish
i
didnt
have
to
try
to
catch
it
as
it
continuously
foams
out
of
the
bottle
this
is
why
i
marked
it
down
for
appearance
but
it
really
wasnt
it
was
very
easy
to
drink
and
i
didnt
feel
like
it
was
too
far
off
the
beaten
path
for
me
a
solid
brew
for
sure
and
a
touch
of
the
funk
not
much
alcohol
presence
to
speak
of
here
pleasant
dry
mouthfeel
that
really
works
here

54doesnt
seem
completely
appropriate
as
a
biere
de
garde
so
this
review
is
not
entirely
rated
to
style
here
drinkability
is
decent
but
i
wouldnt
make
a
session
out
of
it
very
good
overall
poured
from
a
750mp
bottle
into
a
standard
pint
glass
massive
sediment
lines
the
neck
of
the
bottle
foam
immediately
issues
forth
a
very
slow
pour
yielded
a
huge
head
this
was
a
real
gusher
nice
head
retention
and
fantastic
lacing
pours
a
translucient
orange
pumpkin
color
smells
slightly
sour
and
of
rotting
wood
tastes
slightly
bitter
hints
of
vanilla
with
an
underlying
sticky
sweetness
oaking
really
adds
to
the
flavor
of
this
brew
has
a
bit
a
citrus
finish
very
nice
robust
mouthfeel
dry
finish
drinkability
though
is
a
different
matter
beer
is
very
rich
but
slightly
sour
for
my
tastes
this
was
a
very
enjoyable
beer
which
i
will
certainly
be
revisiting
again
an
interesting
and
excellent
beer
mouthfeel
is
prickly
from
the
carbonation
leaves
a
dry
but
lingering
aftertaste
i
think
this
would
make
an
excellent
substitute
for
white
wine
for
a
meal
a
nice
golden
but
the
head
didnt
build
up
at
all
this
beer
was
much
more
sour
than
i
thought
it
would
be
i
was
expecting
only
a
slight
tartness
but
it
really
packed
a
punch
almost
reminding
me
of
russian
river
temptation
it
also
lacked
that
old
wood
type
smell
and
taste
that
ive
found
in
some
of
their
other
beers
not
a
whole
lot
to
say
about
it
other
than
it
very
light
body
and
spritzy
mouthfeel
although
probably
one
of
the
lower
carbonated
jp
beers
ive
had
beer
poured
golden
with
a
nice
white
head
hanging
around
the
outer
edge
of
my
duvel
tulip
glass
nose
is
very
good
dominated
by
sour
apples
taste
is
wonderfully
complex
yet
crisp
and
clean
detected
sour
apples
and
pepper
with
a
nice
dry
bittering
hop
at
the
end
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
and
is
quite
smooth
drinkability
is
quite
nice
one
cannot
detect
that
this
was
aged
in
oak
but
is
quite
smooth
and
refreshing
yet
very
complex
must
try
for
fans
of
this
style
drinkability
my
first
introduction
to
brett
was
just
a
few
months
ago
and
ive
been
looking
for
more
to
try
this
was
an
extremely
interesting
example
the
mix
of
belgian
golden
sour
and
brett
made
it
a
challenging
beer
which
is
welcome
when
im
sitting
down
for
a
tasting
its
a
bit
pricey
10
49
for
a
750ml
at
liquor
mart
on
colorado
blvd
so
i
wont
be
buying
a
ton
but
ill
definitely
pick
up
some
more
in
the
future
good
for
weeknights
when
i
want
to
savor
just
a
glass
or
two
white
foam
and
lace
dominate
the
spicy
citrus
with
juicy
fruits
body
is
nuttin
but
foam
surprised
this
didnt
blow
up
in
the
fridge
bummed
out
what
a
waste
i
think
it
was
a
10
bomber
too
d
a
very
complex
and
delicious
beer
from
jolly
pumpkin
interesting
flavors
although
im
not
exactly
well
versed
in
the
biere
de
mars
category
certainly
worth
trying
and
its
not
that
hard
to
finish
your
own
750ml
yourself
would
i
drink
it
again
sure
if
youre
buying
pops
off
and
flows
all
over
keep
a
glass
close
by
nice
clean
golden
color
after
a
good
decantation
great
big
rocky
head
that
sticks
to
glass
well
and
leaves
a
thin
layer
of
head
behind
smell
is
sour
and
tart
about
like
a
gueuze
slightly
sweet
fruity
tartness
keeps
reminding
me
of
gueuzes
and
tastes
great
the
mouthfeel
is
less
dry
than
the
bam
biere
we
just
had
and
theres
still
some
acidic
carbonation
overall
i
thought
it
was
very
enjoyable
this
was
my
first
beer
style
and
not
my
last
i
totally
recommend
it
a
sour
beer
i
could
say
i
enjoyed
yep
could
be
decent
training
wheels
for
me
as
i
slowly
walk
down
the
road
of
sour
beer
still
its
expensive
for
what
you
get
serving
type
chimay
glass
d
i
love
this
beer
i
need
to
go
buy
more
you
should
too
d
mild
sourness
wheaty
body
pretty
strong
abv
however
its
not
noticeable
very
good
beer
overall
the
aroma
suggests
something
pretty
funky
and
sour
a
la
russian
river
but
the
taste
is
quite
a
bit
different
well
worth
a
try
and
definitely
interests
me
in
trying
jps
other
offerings
ive
tried
lots
of
the
hard
to
find
jp
beers
but
never
this
one
for
some
reason
despite
it
being
in
every
store
in
town
batch
229
pours
a
shiny
clear
orangeyellow
with
a
wispy
white
head
and
lots
of
bubble
action
smells
mildly
hoppy
with
some
sour
funkiness
very
fresh
and
inviting
tangy
citrus
taste
is
only
slightly
sour
with
an
aggressive
bite
of
citrus
and
spicy
hops
spiced
notes
mix
with
an
earthy
and
dry
backbone
on
the
finish
an
ennervating
drink
with
keeps
you
interested
and
tingles
the
taste
buds
alcohol
well
hidden
too
but
im
feeling
it
by
the
end
of
the
bottle
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
pretty
complex
cant
wait
to
get
another
one
poured
a
25oz
bottle
into
my
abbaye
du
valdieu
goblet
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
yellow
pink
with
a
slight
melon
head
that
dissipates
into
a
slight
film
around
the
edges
of
the
glass
this
beer
really
reminds
of
the
way
grapefruit
juice
looks
in
the
glass
the
aroma
is
slightly
tart
up
front
with
hints
of
grass
and
orange
peel
the
taste
is
slightly
tart
its
more
like
a
grapefruit
tart
and
not
a
funky
tart
citrus
is
one
of
the
more
noticeable
flavor
profiles
also
it
reminds
me
of
white
grape
peels
while
this
beer
has
pronounced
flavors
in
the
front
and
tail
of
the
taste
the
middle
was
pretty
watery
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thinner
than
i
thought
it
would
be
there
was
also
just
a
slight
bit
of
a
diacetyl
that
came
out
when
it
warmed
its
a
good
beer
by
a
great
brewery
d
the
base
beer
seems
to
be
a
decent
if
somewhat
mild
siason
with
some
nice
witbier
like
qualities
in
the
mouthfeel
the
earthy
sour
character
is
nice
and
well
developed
but
at
the
cost
of
turning
the
beer
into
a
bottlerocket
mouthfeel
was
incredibly
zippy
and
medium
bodied
i
would
highly
recommend
pairing
this
beer
with
a
something
as
funky
and
complex
as
itself
a
washed
rind
soft
french
cheese
would
make
a
perfect
acompaniment
thanks
to
joey
at
south
bay
liquor
for
this
one
poured
from
the
bottle
into
an
oversized
wine
glass
a
beautiful
golden
color
with
a
fat
head
that
loses
size
very
quickly
but
still
sticks
around
some
aromas
of
spice
and
flowers
with
a
little
bit
of
funk
and
alcohol
underneath
taste
is
initially
sour
but
quickly
transitions
into
spices
malts
apples
and
some
hops
mouthfeel
is
a
little
on
the
thin
side
and
the
beer
is
well
carbonated
overall
the
flavors
dont
quite
mesh
together
hurting
the
drinkabilty
this
is
definitely
an
interesting
beer
just
not
my
favorite
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
snifter
i
didnt
even
have
time
to
throw
the
cap
away
before
the
beer
gushed
forth
like
a
forth
of
july
firework
i
started
it
into
a
pint
glass
which
was
half
filled
with
the
golden
beer
and
the
other
half
with
a
frothy
white
head
that
had
peaks
like
whipped
cream
then
i
was
able
to
pour
the
remainder
into
the
snifter
interestingly
the
beer
that
settled
into
the
snifter
was
more
of
a
deep
golden
color
while
that
which
was
poured
into
the
pint
glass
was
more
of
a
yellow
gold
the
smell
of
this
thing
was
amazing
with
lots
of
apple
dominating
it
was
poured
cold
at
which
time
it
was
very
refreshing
as
it
warmed
a
lot
of
the
alcohol
came
through
and
it
proved
to
be
quite
strong
i
still
noted
lots
of
apple
though
which
became
overpowered
by
the
alcohol
a
remarkable
beer
overall
as
it
exceeded
any
expectations
i
had
for
it
definitely
recommended
would
an
abbeye
de
st
bon
chien
by
any
other
name
be
as
sweet
the
bottom
line
jp
has
carved
out
a
mi
niche
for
themselves
as
purveyors
of
sour
beer
oro
is
another
example
of
the
style
but
it
is
subdued
enough
to
possibly
have
some
more
crossover
appeal
i
personally
found
it
solid
but
not
remarkable
i
do
like
the
oak
presence
though
d
i
tried
it
yea
not
bad
but
probably
wont
pick
up
another
d
for
me
to
say
a
sour
beer
is
drinkable
is
something
really
well
put
together
beer
the
barrel
aging
is
probably
what
saved
this
beer
for
me
it
cut
the
funk
down
to
a
manageable
level
while
still
leaving
enough
of
the
bret
to
make
it
interesting
a
friend
had
been
recommendied
their
beers
to
me
and
i
am
glad
i
finally
had
one
pours
a
pale
bright
golden
color
with
a
big
highcarbonationpowered
white
head
that
leaves
lots
of
lace
and
lasting
pillow
of
foam
on
top
of
the
beer
the
nose
has
a
mixed
sour
smell
with
some
of
the
funkiness
of
brett
along
side
some
sweeter
wild
yeast
smells
in
addition
to
the
yeast
theres
a
substantial
belgian
pale
malt
presence
and
hopandblack
pepper
combo
on
the
palate
initially
funky
followed
by
a
sweeter
middle
in
which
those
pale
malts
and
some
fruity
belgian
yeast
esters
come
to
the
fore
theres
a
pear
element
to
the
fruitiness
toward
the
end
things
get
drier
and
more
sour
with
a
slightly
puckering
feel
the
finish
is
sharply
acidic
which
comes
out
of
nowhere
for
this
relatively
soft
sour
beer
mouthfeel
is
brisk
with
both
acidity
and
some
stony
carbonation
overall
this
is
very
interesting
tasty
and
complex
beer
the
sourness
is
wellintegrated
with
the
belgian
golden
ale
aspects
of
the
beer
so
things
are
interesting
while
remaining
tasty
and
drinkable
out
of
a
750ml
capped
bottle
pours
a
bright
hazy
orange
color
with
a
decent
pure
white
head
that
left
a
sparse
cap
the
aroma
is
of
tart
granny
smith
apples
cider
lemon
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
a
big
apple
cider
taste
with
some
lemony
characteristics
earthy
spices
and
a
little
hop
in
the
end
the
feel
is
quite
light
almost
watery
it
is
well
carbonated
and
you
can
notice
the
8
abv
in
the
end
finishes
on
the
tart
side
overall
a
very
good
brew
perhaps
could
use
a
touch
more
malt
to
add
body
and
hide
the
booze
better
recommended
taste
clean
introduction
that
leads
right
into
a
pleasant
sort
of
sourness
that
shocked
me
at
first
but
is
definitely
the
centerpiece
of
the
taste
citrusy
hops
abound
in
the
background
as
does
a
peppery
spiciness
finishes
very
dry
showing
off
its
alcohol
content
drinkability
is
pretty
good
id
probably
like
to
see
the
abv
dialed
back
a
bit
or
have
more
complexity
to
the
flavor
to
round
it
out
but
its
light
in
the
belly
and
each
sip
begets
another
appears
like
a
burst
of
sunshine
golden
orange
haze
with
a
brilliant
white
head
formed
with
fine
even
belgian
style
lacing
as
it
dwindles
aroma
is
a
soothing
mix
of
tart
yogurt
and
barrel
aged
apple
cider
with
an
air
of
fruitiness
and
herbal
hops
thrown
into
the
mix
as
well
definitely
spiced
with
another
aspect
of
band
aids
coming
in
as
well
and
this
particular
oro
is
from
a
green
bottle
thats
a
first
and
this
is
like
at
least
the
fourth
time
ive
tasted
it
batch
223
peppery
pineapple
and
other
passion
fruits
blend
nicely
as
well
especially
as
it
warms
flavor
wise
very
dry
with
tart
apples
and
pineapple
and
a
strong
assertive
spice
ridden
peppery
note
that
rides
throughout
tart
lactic
notes
throughout
really
thick
in
this
one
again
finish
is
dry
like
plain
mediterranean
yogurt
and
green
apple
cider
kinda
intense
mouthfeel
is
effervescent
and
body
here
is
medium
to
light
in
range
overall
enjoyable
again
the
dryness
is
overwhelming
and
the
acidity
would
sting
if
you
had
any
open
sores
on
your
gums
kinda
like
that
orange
juice
burn
drinkability
is
actually
much
better
than
my
description
impairs
and
again
its
great
with
food
for
the
peppery
spicy
citrus
and
dry
palate
cleansing
qualities
a
fine
beer
that
i
will
always
be
sure
to
sample
when
given
the
opportunity
drinkability
my
first
jolly
pumpkin
and
i
wish
i
could
get
more
though
i
will
be
seeking
them
out
from
now
on
i
dont
mean
to
bring
in
my
first
and
recent
garde
dog
but
wow
i
dont
know
if
this
is
what
the
styles
supposed
to
be
like
but
if
it
is
im
not
sure
i
want
to
try
anything
else
unless
its
like
this
or
surpassing
it
paid
around
8
and
thankfully
it
wasnt
ruined
after
the
rocket
shiplike
start
but
only
got
better
ok
drinkability
the
alcohol
catches
up
to
you
pretty
quickly
but
it
is
very
complex
and
pretty
tasty
something
id
think
about
trying
again
and
well
worth
the
initial
try
d
i
liked
this
one
well
enough
and
would
like
to
try
more
of
this
style
im
guessing
that
there
are
better
examples
out
there
this
beer
has
really
thrown
me
for
a
loop
i
store
and
drink
most
of
my
beers
at
cellar
temp
could
that
have
something
to
do
with
the
explosion
overall
an
interesting
beer
and
something
id
definitely
try
again
its
my
first
jolly
pumpkin
im
surprised
both
at
its
classification
as
well
as
the
food
pairing
its
been
recommended
with
cheese
wise
i
see
this
as
more
akin
to
lambic
pairings
with
tart
goat
cheeses
a
tomme
perhaps
being
apt
certainly
not
nutty
parm
indian
makes
an
interesting
mix
provied
its
a
mild
curry
using
coconut
or
cream
in
its
base
the
acidity
would
help
id
see
this
better
paired
with
thai
sweetmilder
coconut
curries
in
any
case
a
good
beer
that
is
definitely
closer
to
jolly
pumpkins
own
description
golden
ale
than
what
is
listed
here
dvery
drinkable
i
go
through
about
two
of
these
a
week
another
excellent
release
from
jolly
pumpkin
d
this
totally
crept
up
on
me
i
would
also
pair
this
with
a
nice
salad
for
dinner
good
beer
to
introduce
your
friends
to
craft
brewing
truly
refined
and
one
of
a
kind
the
spiciness
does
linger
but
i
was
fooled
again
by
the
abv
into
drinking
more
quickly
than
i
should
have
a
good
balance
of
earthiness
with
crisp
tartness
makes
it
go
down
easy
very
nice
taste
mouthfeel
simultaneously
tart
funky
and
spicy
nice
funky
brett
presence
its
wellplaced
not
too
extreme
but
assertive
enough
to
make
it
a
decidedly
strange
beer
fruity
flavors
of
granny
smith
apple
lemon
and
banana
make
up
the
foundation
while
the
funk
keeps
things
interesting
carbonation
is
crisp
almost
champagnelike
with
the
light
body
further
adding
to
that
association
finishes
quite
dry
leaving
a
mild
sourness
on
the
palate
great
beer
refreshing
and
enjoyable
to
drink
best
to
serve
a
bit
on
the
cold
side
and
share
a
bottle
recommended
pours
a
nice
amber
in
color
has
a
nice
frothy
head
that
hangs
around
for
awhile
smell
is
slightly
tart
and
sour
taste
is
much
the
same
but
to
a
lesser
degree
than
appears
in
the
nose
mouthfeel
is
full
and
creamy
this
is
a
highly
sessionable
beer
that
i
could
drink
all
day
not
overbearing
in
any
way
a
solid
beer
from
jp
tastes
of
fruits
pale
malt
a
bit
of
funk
and
faint
traces
peppery
spices
the
more
beers
i
have
from
jolly
pumpkin
the
better
they
get
d
not
my
style
but
this
was
among
the
better
examples
of
this
style
it
took
some
of
the
edge
off
compared
to
most
of
its
european
cousins
the
wild
yeasts
of
michigan
must
not
be
quite
as
wild
as
those
of
flanders
this
would
make
a
nice
drink
to
complement
the
salad
course
of
a
fine
meal
d
crazy
drinkable
wonderful
experience
drinking
this
beer
dreally
nice
beer
very
drinkable
great
beer
to
get
the
night
kicked
off
appertif
nice
with
fruit
verdict
a
decent
biere
de
garde
with
jps
trademark
sourness
very
drinkable
if
you
like
sour
ales
close
enough
to
the
style
as
well
gushing
from
the
bottle
this
beer
pours
a
very
cloudy
medium
straw
color
with
a
massive
puffy
luxurious
white
head
carbonation
can
be
seen
racing
to
surface
very
intimidating
the
aroma
is
really
amazing
spices
are
very
predominant
not
sure
if
added
or
ferm
byproduct
with
a
solid
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
character
along
with
some
clove
in
addition
there
is
a
tart
sour
cherry
note
with
some
bright
citrus
overtaking
the
bulk
of
the
boquet
on
the
palate
a
wheaty
lightly
toasted
malt
fills
the
mouth
some
other
slightly
medicinal
and
astringent
flavors
come
through
providing
the
requisite
funk
hops
are
very
muted
mouthfeel
is
where
this
beer
both
shines
and
fails
it
is
perhaps
one
of
the
most
carbonated
beers
ive
had
in
recent
memory
to
its
dissadvantage
but
it
was
incredibly
smooth
and
creamy
helping
the
drinkability
i
look
forward
to
getting
to
the
rest
of
their
line
the
taste
is
softer
than
expected
unripened
hops
and
astringent
sour
citrus
pair
with
a
big
oaken
backbone
massive
booze
notes
coat
the
back
of
the
palate
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
bubbly
with
a
warming
alcoholinfued
finish
that
quickly
works
its
way
into
the
stomach
this
beer
is
most
likely
a
onetime
deal
for
me
although
i
enjoy
the
complexity
and
admire
the
craftsmanship
that
goes
into
jolly
pumpkins
oak
aged
ales
theyre
just
not
that
drinkable
drinkability
as
always
its
another
weird
wild
ride
from
jolly
pumpkin
clear
copper
color
with
a
fiery
viscous
foam
sediment
rocked
by
the
foaming
floats
wildly
in
the
glass
smells
vibrantly
tart
like
a
lemoninfused
orange
julius
tripelmaltiness
is
present
as
well
as
some
sour
grape
and
portlike
character
much
creamier
than
i
remember
with
a
definite
bite
of
redwine
soaked
leather
finishes
very
dry
little
to
no
oxidation
present
sweetness
exists
as
more
of
an
undertone
it
still
maintains
its
candy
corn
integrity
hinting
at
woody
butterscotch
in
the
finish
very
drinkable
and
definitely
at
its
prime
like
hennepin
this
beer
would
go
very
well
with
ahem
food
open
now
enjoy
if
anything
this
is
a
very
very
complex
beer
with
quite
a
bit
going
on
the
beer
pours
a
cloudy
hazy
orangegold
color
with
a
thick
frothy
head
and
lots
of
lacing
and
retention
the
smell
wow
the
smell
is
vinous
yeasty
lemon
zest
and
clove
there
is
a
very
obvious
oakiness
to
the
beer
and
you
can
smell
the
wood
age
in
the
yeast
and
malt
there
is
a
slight
medicinal
quality
and
perhaps
a
little
mustiness
in
the
smell
as
well
the
aroma
is
certainly
an
indication
of
even
more
complexity
on
the
way
this
is
a
light
to
medium
bodied
fairly
well
carbonated
beer
with
enough
haze
to
indicate
bottle
conditioning
there
is
not
the
typical
sediment
or
yeasty
bits
floating
about
the
taste
when
the
beer
is
chilled
is
strongly
tilted
towards
the
floral
bouquet
spices
lemon
zest
mustiness
and
wild
yeast
all
over
the
palate
the
oaky
vinous
qualities
are
more
pronounced
when
the
beer
is
chilled
when
the
beer
gets
a
chance
to
settle
you
will
get
more
apple
spiced
fruits
perhaps
some
hints
of
coriander
clove
rind
and
some
pepperish
bite
there
is
an
undefined
taste
that
others
may
be
referring
to
as
funk
i
guess
ill
use
that
one
as
well
the
funk
remains
pretty
constant
from
the
first
pour
to
the
last
the
beer
is
overwhelmingly
yeasty
and
the
yeast
does
dance
all
over
the
rainbow
of
other
tastes
and
flavors
of
this
beer
there
is
just
so
much
going
on
with
this
beer
it
truly
is
an
experience
trying
to
pin
down
specific
tastes
is
difficult
things
blend
dissipate
reappear
and
reblend
this
is
an
exceptionally
complex
beer
well
worth
seeking
out
this
is
the
type
of
beer
that
serious
oenologists
will
appreciate
lchaim
this
beer
is
definitely
a
keeper
the
next
time
i
go
out
for
a
drink
with
friends
i
will
definitely
be
recommending
this
strong
golden
beauty
dvery
nice
bdg
like
beer
cider
this
one
is
a
winner
in
the
jp
line
i
love
the
sourness
and
the
funk
if
you
like
big
funk
this
might
be
for
you
imo
in
this
beer
the
funk
overpowers
most
subtly
complex
characteristics
that
might
be
there
d
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
very
approachable
although
you
have
to
wait
to
long
for
the
head
to
go
down
750
ml
bottle
cloudy
golden
color
modest
head
with
little
lacing
tart
yeasty
musty
and
alcohol
ester
aroma
with
little
hops
smell
mouthfeel
is
the
right
balance
between
thick
and
thin
with
only
moderate
carbonation
present
taste
has
definite
sour
notes
and
that
belgian
yeasty
tang
almost
like
a
more
mild
version
of
what
you
get
in
the
finish
of
a
flemish
red
or
a
lambic
refreshing
like
a
saison
but
the
quaffability
could
fool
you
with
its
wellmasked
8
abv
very
drinkable
i
will
be
searching
this
one
out
again
this
is
a
beer
that
i
can
see
not
appealing
to
a
lot
of
folks
but
for
the
adventurous
or
inquisitive
i
highly
recommend
trying
this
beer
i
know
it
has
me
primed
to
try
other
beers
from
jolly
pumpkin
jolly
pumpkin
makes
some
great
beers
you
never
know
what
youll
get
with
each
bottle
you
pick
up
some
batches
are
good
some
great
and
some
ok
thats
my
only
complaint
about
jolly
pumpkin
is
the
consistency
of
course
im
sure
its
practically
impossible
to
be
consistent
using
bacteria
to
ferment
every
batch
and
thats
what
makes
jolly
pumpkin
special
overall
this
beer
was
good
i
would
drink
it
again
it
was
not
spectacular
but
a
decent
offering
pours
a
cloudy
golden
yellow
with
a
white
head
aromas
of
sour
pineapple
and
well
like
a
pina
colada
in
the
taste
pineapple
coconut
and
some
what
musty
a
tart
mouthfeel
and
a
sour
dry
fruitiness
in
the
aftertaste
interesting
beer
mostly
like
a
sour
pina
colada
pours
cloudy
pale
gold
with
a
thin
head
that
leaves
little
lacing
smells
of
caramel
honey
and
floral
hops
nice
but
a
bit
cloying
taste
follows
suit
with
a
crisp
finish
and
a
citrus
note
that
lingers
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
sticky
drinkability
isnt
bad
i
managed
the
750
bottle
but
wont
manage
more
definitely
an
interesting
beer
and
one
to
try
when
its
available
ya
like
yer
brett
find
it
here
or
in
just
about
any
other
jolly
pumpkin
ale
for
that
matter
because
this
is
a
beer
focusing
on
the
untamed
quality
of
the
yeast
strain
its
not
gonna
be
for
everybody
and
even
those
who
love
this
sort
of
thing
might
save
it
only
for
special
occasions
or
the
mood
so
maybe
the
drinkability
isnt
great
but
it
is
a
highly
recommended
beer
to
fans
of
the
style
fantome
and
flemish
primitive
enthusiasts
and
anyone
into
the
more
daring
unusual
francobelgian
brewers
o
simply
lovely
8
of
goodness
poured
into

nice
touch

the

very
well
medium

drinkable
this
is
a
pretty
tasty
brew
recommended
this
beer
poured
a
yelloworange
color
with
a
very
thick
head

nice
lacing
the
aroma
is
spicy
and
quite
inviting
the
taste
is
spicy
and
cereal
with
the
yeast
evident
the
mouthfeel
is
light

medium
and
quite
carbonated
overall
the
flavor
and
depth
make
this
an
interesting
drinking
beer
pours
a
cloudy
corn

with
a
pillowy
cloudy
white
two
finger
head
super
sticky
on
the
sides
with
a
head
that
sticks
around
forever
smell
is
slightly
sour
scent
of
cloves
lemongrass
pepper
sour
apples
and
a
hint
of
yeast
a
tiny
hint
of
vanilla
goodness
from
the
oak
aging
in
the
nose
as
well
taste
starts
off
with
a
bit
honey
sweetness
with
a
blend
of
mandarine
oranges
towards
the
end
a
bready
yeast
flavor
emerges
and
continues
into
the
aftertaste
with
a
hint
of
spicey
pepper
other
than
those
flavors
it
seems
a
bit
empty
and
watered
down
in
terms
of
taste
mouthfeel
is
light
and
fluffy
with
a
bit
overpowering
carbonation
drinkability
is
pretty
good
for
8
i
dont
detect
much
alcohol
decent
beer
and
interesting
style
glad
i
gave
this
one
a
shot
the
appearance
in
the
glass
was
of
a
dense
slushy
applesauce
with
one
or
two
finger
white
head
well
retained
lacing
was
quite
good
with
foam
streaks
and
imprints
on
the
glass
throughout
the
nose
was
floral
spicy
cinnamon
a
hint
of
green
apple
but
then
more
spice
and
nutmeg
in
particular
the
taste
is
all
top
of
the
mouth
to
begin
with
spicy
hoppy
citrus
rind
sour
fruit
all
nicely
balanced
with
a
refreshing
effervescence
that
is
never
too
overpowering
gentle
sour
fruit
lingering
aftertaste
the
8
per
cent
alcohol
is
hardly
apparent
overall
a
full
rich
complex
and
satisfying
beer
that
gets
close
to
top
marks
in
my
book
i
cant
wait
to
visit
detroit
soon
so
i
can
return
the
favour
to
biegaman
once
again
i
ask
myself
if
jolly
pumpkin
could
very
well
be
my
favourite
brewery
their
products
are
so
unique
and
so
special
this
paired
wonderfully
with
a
mix
of
cheeses
and
a
hungry
stomach
like
every
other
jp
product
id
endeavour
to
have
this
one
on
hand
in
the
cellar
at
all
times
this
was
greatly
enjoyed
overall
id
say
this
is
at
least
worth
a
try
bottle
poured
a
slighly
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
very
thick
white
head
good
lacing
aroma
is
floral
and
tart
with
hints
of
fruit
to
it
nice
full
mouthfeel
nice
flavor
of
apricot
with
some
citrus
hints
to
it
a
pretty
solid
offering
from
jolly
pumpkin
good
for
a
toast
but
im
not
too
eager
to
share
highly
carbonated
mouthfeel
which
definitely
works
with
this
sour
brew
very
refreshing
i
really
love
how
this
beer
opens
up
a
little
sweet
and
finishes
completely
dry
and
sour
a
lot
of
sour
beers
are
just
that
sour
thats
it
highly
recommended
drinkability
i
dont
particularly
care
for
tart
beers
but
this
one
wasnt
too
bad
there
was
enough
other
stuff
going
on
that
it
covered
up
most
of
the
lemony
puckering
that
bothers
me
i
can
see
how
people
would
really
enjoy
it
though
its
worth
trying
d
so
tasty
this
was
really
impressive
a
very
well
made
brew
and
one
i
will
be
going
back
to
a
weird
beer
for
sure
i
would
give
this
a
5
if
it
didnt
have
those
damn
lambic
notes
to
it
still
it
is
a
notable
beer
to
try
this
is
a
pretty
nice
easygoing
farmhouse
beer
drinkability
im
suprised
to
see
8
on
this
one
quite
quaffable
and
very
refreshing
overall
nice
brew
for
the
summer
weather
or
any
weather
for
that
matter
extremely
refreshing
and
flavorful
i
highly
recommend
drinking
this
beer
at
cellar
temp
though
because
the
green
apple
sweetness
is
much
more
apparent
in
the
flavor
drinkability
awesome
lots
of
enticement
and
longevity
here
enjoy
whenever
the
mood
strikes
or
for
a
special
occasion
i
am
easily
going
to
finish
this
bottle
jolly
pumpkin
strikes
again
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
honey
gold
color
with
good
head
retention
and
excellent
lacing
this
beer
looks
thick
rich
and
viscuous
on
the
nose
one
gets
an
intense
aroma
of
honey
butter
orange
and
lime
once
again
this
beers
smells
very
impressive
on
the
palate
this
beer
is
quite
rich
and
sweet
with
flavors
of
honey
pineapple
juice
and
some
citrus
the
hops
kick
in
a
bit
on
the
finish
giving
this
beer
a
slight
drypeppery
flavor
which
keeps
the
beer
from
becoming
cloying
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
on
the
palate
and
the
alcohol
is
a
bit
more
noticeable
then
i
might
like
still
this
is
a
very
impressive
beer
from
jolly
pumpkin
one
that
i
will
not
hesitate
to
order
again
d
the
alcohol
heat
makes
drinkability
a
little
tough
as
the
alcohol
is
unable
to
hide
despite
that
the
drink
is
full
of
vim
and
vigor
with
apologies
to
wws
for
that
one
drinkability
the
funk
didnt
work
in
jolly
pumpkins
amber
ale
but
its
great
in
this
biere
de
garde
there
needs
to
be
more
biere
de
gardes
and
more
good
ones
like
this
i
might
make
this
my
favorite
style
if
i
had
even
semiregular
access
to
examples
as
tasty
as
this
one
d
a
very
drinkable
biere
de
garde
an
interesting
take
on
the
style
i
really
feel
that
lactic
acidity
and
bacterial
presence
added
a
lot
to
this
beer
as
noted
above
the
taste
on
this
is
very
sour
and
that
first
sip
may
be
a
little
harsh
but
keep
going
by
the
third
or
fourth
sip
youll
really
notice
the
spice
and
citrusy
flavors
coming
through
the
complexity
of
the
different
flavors
works
well
together
750ml
bottle
from
a1
togo
first
off
this
bottle
is
a
gusher
even
after
pouring
much
of
the
beer
out
the
fizz
still
creeps
out
of
the
bottle
not
a
fan
of
that
having
said
that
light
yellow
hazy
but
fairly
clear
body
with
an
inch
or
so
of
white
head
smells
citrusy
pithy
yeasty
and
sweet
citrusy
pithy
and
slightly
sour
as
far
as
flavor
goes
as
with
other
jolly
pumpkins
ive
had
alcohol
is
not
present
in
either
the
aroma
or
flavor
lighter
in
body
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
pretty
drinkable
for
the
abv
and
flavor
combination
pretty
good
though
not
their
best
offering
definitely
the
best
biere
de
garde
ive
had
though
dwith
any
beer
that
has
a
sour
aspect
to
it
many
will
find
this
terrible
but
those
familiar
and
willing
will
definately
enjoy
this
one
two
thumbs
way
up
on
the
direction
that
this
brewery
is
taking
light
body
with
refreshing
carbonation
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
well
done
overall
impression
dangerously
drinkable
lots
of
flavor
this
is
a
winner
would
love
to
see
it
in
6
packs
750
ml
bottle
pours
a
lightly
hazed
golden
color
with
a
massive
meranguelike
rocky
white
head
excellent
stickage
and
lacing
the
aroma
has
a
gueuzelike
funk
with
notes
of
clover
honey
pear
wet
wood
sand
and
old
pennies
some
hops
make
their
presence
known
but
subtly
flavor
starts
with
some
fruity
malt
sweetness
like
asian
pear
then
the
brett
kicks
in
resulting
in
a
drier
mildy
sour
finish
with
a
faint
grassy
aftertaste
metallic
twang
from
the
higher
carbonation
level
but
not
offly
so
the
mouthfel
fares
well
with
the
carbonation
and
leaves
it
bubbly
and
prickly
all
the
way
through
the
swallow
a
very
nice
bière
de
garde
that
has
a
significant
belgiumfrench
border
feel
to
it
i
only
wish
it
was
as
spicy
and
peppery
as
the
label
claimed
regardless
a
very
nice
ale
highly
drinkable
beer
i
wish
i
could
get
this
on
tap
out
here
in
oregon
overall
another
interesting
jolly
pumpkin
brew
i
like
the
balance
of
this
one
its
fairly
sour
but
has
some
sweetness
and
the
slightly
bitter
finish
to
counteract
this
was
a
cloudy
yellow
beer
with
a
small
covering
of
white
bubbles
on
top
the
taste
is
spicy
fruity
and
has
lots
of
carbonation
it
was
also
slightly
acidic
and
reminds
me
a
bit
of
champagne
the
taste
also
had
a
slight
bit
of
sour
but
not
much
this
was
my
second
jolly
pumpkin
beer
and
i
enjoyed
it
a
750ml
bottle
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
it
was
a
hazy
yellow
witj
a
voluminous
head
very
wellcarbonated
in
fact
every
beer
ive
tried
from
jolly
pumpkin
has
been
so
carbonated
that
it
keeps
on
flowing
from
the
bottle
after
the
first
pour
it
had
a
rather
nondescript
fruityspicy
aroma
a
fruity
banana
taste
with
a
peppery
aftertaste
that
persisted
a
little
bit
of
mustiness
light
and
pleasant
in
the
mouth
pretty
good
beer
best
served
at
cellar
temperature
the
character
is
much
more
complex
too
cold
and
all
you
get
is
sour
hardly
got
2
glasses
out
of
this
bottle
and
i
feel
cheated
this
bottle
poured
with
a
firm
white
head
that
did
not
go
away
the
beer
color
is
bright
koolaid
yellow
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
streaming
up
the
glass
the
aroma
is
to
die
for
its
very
sweet
with
apricot
and
lemoney
aromas
the
flavor
is
sweet
and
spicy
this
is
the
first
biere
de
garde
ive
ever
had
and
now
i
want
to
try
any
i
can
get
my
hands
on
eric
d
i
am
glad
i
returned
to
this
not
rating
as
high
as
i
previously
reviewed
however
a
solid
beer
and
gentle
funkiness
from
either
yeast
or
barrel
is
adding
dimension
it
is
a
good
example
of
biere
de
garde
and
seriously
drinkable
props
to
andjusticeforale
for
using
kudzu
for
describing
the
neverending
flow
of
foam
upon
opening
the
beer
pours
a
pale
gold
color
with
a
towering
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
light
pale
malt
scent
along
with
a
boat
load
of
fruit
esters
its
tart
with
some
earthy
notes
the
taste
is
good
also
it
has
a
nice
refreshing
flavor
that
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
a
bit
earthy
with
a
slight
tart
edge
its
light
and
boasts
of
pale
malts
with
some
peppery
notes
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
its
a
mediumfull
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
tastey
beer
with
lots
of
character
a
good
drinker
fantastic
to
plow
through
a
bottle
of
this
quite
nice
when
a
cold
spring
night
turns
to
thoughts
of
heat
and
warm
days
to
come
all
of
the
bottles
ive
aged
over
6
months
have
gushed
forth
from
the
bottle
upon
opening
they
have
also
dried
out
substantially
owing
to
the
continued
brett
activity
no
doubt
the
brett
also
seems
to
contribute
such
an
elevated
tartness
that
some
of
the
more
subtle
flavors
are
lost
definitely
an
interesting
and
complex
ale
young
or
old
but
i
prefer
it
on
the
younger
side
if
you
love
saisons
and
brett
youll
love
this
funky
wild
ale
my
first
wild
ale
so
i
didnt
know
what
to
expect
from
a
750
bottle
this
beer
poured
a
very
heady
pale
golden
color
the
head
quickly
receeded
to
a
nice
lacing
smell
is
a
powerful
one
musty
yet
sweet
a
bit
of
alcohol
can
be
percieved
on
the
nose
as
well
tastes
of
spice
and
pepper
but
sweet
malt
as
well
overall
very
belgian
in
mind
body
and
spirit
complex
and
delicious
mahalo
to
jolly
pumpkin
d
good
beer
but
the
weakest
offering
from
jp
which
really
isnt
saying
muchstill
better
than
95
of
the
micros
out
there
too
much
oak
stands
out
and
not
in
the
balanced
way
wife
loves
this
beer
though
certainly
interesting
its
my
first
biere
de
garde
so
i
dont
know
how
well
this
represents
the
style
it
is
a
decent
farmhousestyle
ale
but
there
are
others
i
like
better
still
worth
a
try
and
i
am
definitely
interested
in
tasting
more
of
jolly
pumpkins
beers
recommended
love
the
label
lore
nothing
like
a
biere
de
garde
from
a
michigan
brewery
with
hawian
jargon
this
poured
with
a
thin
bonewhite
head
with
little
retention
the
color
was
a
lightyellowstrawyellow
with
nequality
clarity
the
nose
had
a
very
pronounced
brett
presence
the
mouthfeel
was
effervescent
and
palatecleansing
the
taste
was
tart
vinous
like
white
wine
and
lipsmackingly
dry
the
pour
reminded
me
of
champagne
between
the
color
and
the
bubbly
appearance
the
finish
was
dry
with
a
light
oakiness
i
would
vote
for
this
over
la
roja
sorry
kitty
second
jolly
pumpkin
i
have
tried
and
the
second
gusher
lovely
start
to
things
quickly
poured
out
to
avoid
having
to
lap
it
up
off
of
my
bar
top
aroma
is
really
funky
and
difficult
to
describe
old
socks
or
something
after
the
gusher
of
foam
in
my
glass
settled
down
a
lovely
golden
ale
awaited
very
sour
with
a
decent
amount
of
citrus
fruit
i
thought
the
aroma
was
actually
more
peppery
than
the
taste
once
you
get
used
to
the
funkiness
its
a
nice
smooth
sipper
carbonation
is
about
right
finish
is
dry
and
woody
this
was
a
lot
more
refreshing
than
i
thought
it
would
be
alcohol
is
quite
muted
and
overall
this
is
a
unique
and
tasty
offering
easily
one
of
the
best
bottles
ive
tried
i
reccomend
letting
this
one
breathe
and
appreciate
it
with
small
sips
and
whiffs
for
a
good
hour
very
interesting
beer
is
this
a
style
buster
golden
ale
biere
de
garde
tradition
fermented
as
a
wild
ale
oak
aged
lots
of
different
influences
here
thanks
to
brent
for
passing
this
on
another
great
beer
from
jolly
pumpkin
if
you
know
what
to
expect
this
is
not
a
beer
to
introduce
to
your
macro
drinking
friends
i
personally
like
their
la
roja
a
bit
better
this
is
still
a
damn
fine
beer
very
drinkable
given
the
style
im
happier
with
this
beer
than
ive
been
with
a
number
of
jolly
pumpkins
other
beers
which
werent
clearly
designed
as
brettsour
beers
id
buy
it
again
and
ill
finish
this
bottle
happily
this
is
quite
potent
yet
it
lands
as
a
lighter
beer
in
appearance
and
body
strong
flavors
and
alcohol
content
interesting
as
an
unusually
flavored
beer
flavor
is
similar
to
nose
with
some
fruity
green
apple
a
bit
of
musty
funk
and
some
acidity
that
builds
as
the
beer
warms
quite
an
interesting
beer
a
fun
easy
drinker
pours
with
a
huge
tight
foamy
head
like
meringue
good
lacing
as
well
the
beer
itself
is
a
translucent
golden
the
smell
is
sour
with
lemon
and
has
notes
of
coriander
and
bubblegum
the
taste
is
lush
and
complex
winey
sour
spicy
with
coriander
sharp
and
peppery
and
deep
with
interesting
yeast
notes
including
a
little
barnyard
funkiness
and
some
bubblegum
really
amazing
quite
refreshing
in
the
mouth
pretty
carbonated
but
it
doesnt
detract
from
the
flavors
at
all
slightly
more
sour
than
many
biere
de
gardes
but
very
very
drinkable
750ml
bottle
chilled
and
poured
into
tulip
glass
crazy
aggressive
head
huge
fluffy
and
white
like
lumpy
marshmallow
cream
with
thick
chunky
lacing
and
decent
retention
the
body
is
a
golden
blond
with
tons
of
visible
tiny
bubbles
rushing
to
the
head
smells
is
tart
slightly
sweet
and
sour
apple
pear
esters
slight
white
grape
quality
maybe
some
white
pepper
nice
nose
taste
is
crisp
not
very
malty
the
carbonation
and
hops
keep
it
active
though
and
there
is
how
ever
just
enough
sweetness
to
get
you
through
i
definitely
like
the
slightly
tart
acidic
flavor
this
manifests
defienty
a
possible
good
food
beer
the
sourness
reminds
me
of
a
slightly
young
apple
the
idea
of
a
tiny
amount
of
wide
yeast
makes
this
makes
so
much
more
sense
i
like
this
i
doubt
ill
buy
again
just
for
drinking
though
i
first
will
find
some
food
to
activate
it
what
ever
that
is
im
not
sure
thanks
sam
damn
im
lucky
to
be
able
to
get
this
whenever
i
want
definitely
worth
seeking
out
the
alcohol
does
not
assert
itself
but
that
high
carbonation
makes
this
a
bit
difficult
to
really
get
into
drinkability
is
fine
though
all
in
all
i
found
this
much
less
interesting
than
the
last
jp
i
tried
not
enough
to
turn
me
off
mind
you
and
my
brother
said
he
really
liked
this
one
ill
be
giving
roja
a
shot
as
soon
as
i
can
get
some
ultimately
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
that
challenges
you
and
goes
unbelievably
well
with
your
dinner
this
beer
is
very
interesting
but
also
kinda
wildin
i
am
into
it
enough
to
try
the
others
despite
the
high
price
but
doubt
ill
revisit
this
one
a
really
great
domestically
produced
belgian
style
beer
taste
is
a
good
up
front
maltiness
with
the
ever
present
brett
that
has
been
smoothened
due
to
proper
aging
i
would
imagine
this
is
a
beer
that
really
has
very
few
flaws
in
the
taste
department
pehaps
a
little
sour
on
the
finish
but
its
supposed
to
taste
a
little
sour
this
is
clearly
the
best
bottled
american
craft
beer
that
uses
brett
that
i
have
tried
outrageously
drinkableits
pure
gold
just
like
its
labled
d
not
fantastic
here
a
bit
strong
the
bitterness
is
a
tad
unpleasant
i
think
i
will
pass
on
this
in
the
future
i
found
the
calabaza
blanca
to
be
much
more
pleasant
as
a
whole
this
jolly
pumpkin
artisan
ales
is
pretty
fantastic
as
a
whole
i
must
say
though
the
alcohol
is
slightly
evident
and
matures
as
it
warms
a
very
nice
brew
to
drink
when
the
occasion
arises
if
this
brew
were
at
some
of
my
locals
i
would
drink
it
here
and
there
and
everywhere
very
very
carbonated
bottle
overflowed
when
opened
and
continued
to
spill
forth
while
sitting
on
the
counter

its
good
mediumbodied
with
a
lively
feel
refreshing
in
its
acidity
and
fizz
me
gusta
this
is
wonderfully
delicious
and
too
easy
to
drink
i
was
saddened
when
i
got
to
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
unfortunately
some
was
lost
at
the
start
to
excessive
foaming
and
wanted
some
more
ill
be
sure
to
get
more
of
this
outstanding
brew
thin
carbonated
fits
the
style
nicely
i
would
enjoy
this
beer
in
warm
weather
ultimately
overall
a
wonderfull
beer
great
flavors
in
this
beer
that
gives
it
a
nice
complexity
yet
still
delicate
and
not
overwhelming
very
nice
pours
a
hazy
honey
color
with
a
sudsy
white
two
finger
cap
that
dwindles
to
lacings
in
a
hurry
aroma
is
honey
wheat
tropical
fruits
lemongrass
and
light
hop
background
no
alcohol
on
the
nose
flavor
is
a
sour
wheat
in
the
front
with
caramel
and
honey
sweetness
lots
of
spicy
and
citrus
noble
hop
bitterness
lingering
througout
a
earthyyeastiness
is
carried
in
the
background
medium
body
high
carbonation
and
dry
finish
great
beer
i
could
sip
or
quaff
this
anytime
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
pale
orange
color
with
an
enormous
head
five
fingers
in
height
and
a
steady
stream
of
carbonation
rising
from
the
bottom
center
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
full
of
barnyard
funk
but
there
is
also
a
solid
noticable
malt
character
the
taste
is
fruity
yeasty
and
funky
with
a
slight
alcohol
presence
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumfull
bodied
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
very
fine
brew
from
what
is
becoming
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
many
thanks
to
hardtarget
for
graciously
sharing
this
wonderful
ale
major
thanks
to
meadows57
for
the
trade
bought
at
beumont
market
in
portland
or
no
date
poured
in
a
goblet
big
foamy
white
head
atop
a
deep
golden
ale
smells
sweet
like
orange
popsicles
tart
snappy
bite
and
more
orange
popsicle
taste
hops
are
there
too
dry
finish
of
well
water
and
orange
essence
and
honey
water
mouthfeel
is
a
tad
bit
thick
but
soft
carbonation
lingers
for
the
45
minutes
i
swirled
it
the
head
lingered
too
and
even
laced
the
glass
very
interesting
beer
and
worth
seeking
out
more
from
this
brewery
very
carbonated
light
bodied
with
a
fairly
low
drinkability
the
complexity
of
this
one
makes
it
kind
of
difficult
to
drink
many
of
the
8
doesnt
help
either
the
750
im
sharing
with
my
girlfriend
is
plenty
for
both
of
us
disclaimer
i
dont
know
the
proper

for
a

i

i
dont

the

except
whats
listed
on

i
chose
a

based
the

on
my

this
is
amazingly
easy
to
drink
yikes
i
am
only
partly
way
through
my
750ml

i
am

highly
recommended
this
beer
poured
a
cloudy
golden
color
with
huge
pillowy
white
foam
that
persisted
and
coated
the
glass
leaving
some
lacing
the
smell
was
lightly
sweet
belgian
malt
reminiscent
of
duvel
the
taste
was
tart
almost
sour
malty
with
very
light
hoppiness
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
creamy
with
medium
body
and
low
carbonation
feel
the
malt
and
hops
lingered
pleasantly
in
the
finish
this
was
an
enjoyable
beer
with
so
much
flavor
and
fizz
this
is
definitely
a
sipping
beer
great
appearance
and
aroma
however
i
thought
some
of
the
flavor
faded
a
bit
as
the
beer
warmed

in
producing
very
unique

enjoyble
belgian
styled

this
beer
reminds
me
of
the
orange
juice
commercial
where
they
strip
back
the
carton
and
there
is
pulpy
flesh
underneath
and
then
a
spout
is
opened
and
the
juice
pours
ripe

the
box

put
a

heres
what
you
have
a
tart

gumdrop
a
peppery
confection
that
froths
with
an
infected

i
mean
this
in
a
good
way
like
when
a
rich
pumpkin
pie
and
whipped
cream
begin
to
swirl
and
meld
together
from
a
thorough
forking
as
with
all
the
jolly
pumpkin
beers
they
leave
you
thinking
designer
beer
but
also
one
more
bottle
to
figure
out
if
i
like
it
yes
i
do

another

ale
from

i
crave
more
overall
bloody
hell
i
really
fell
for
this
one
a
very
enjoyable
feisty
brew
with
balls
and
a
terrifically
strong
fruity
body
that
successfully
blended
some
artisanal
elements
into
a
barrel
aged
and
seemingly
educated
blonde
biere
de
garde
it
is
not
in
the
traditonal
sense
at
least
but
nicely
done
it
most
certainly
is
this
is
my
favorite
of
the
jolly
pumpkins
so
far
delectable
good
unique
flavor
with
this
one
light
flavor
and
sits
fairly
light
on
the
stomach
pretty
quaffable
worth
a
shot
drinkability
this
is
pretty
good
and
goes
down
fairly
well
would
have
another
750
ml
in
a
session
if
not
driving
etc
because
of
the
abv
bottle
courtesy
of
thebeercellar2
poured
a
light
hazy
golden
color
ale
with
a
huge
foamy
white
head
with
perfect
retention
bottle
was
a
bit
of
a
gusher
when
opened
aroma
of
pepper
is
surprisingly
quite
dominating
with
some
sourness
brett
and
some
traces
of
oak
taste
is
real
interesting
mix
between
sourness
sweet
malt
some
pepper
and
other
spices
though
not
as
much
as
the
aroma
was
suggesting
carbonation
was
a
tad
too
excessive
and
body
was
above
average
another
impressive
effort
from
this
fine
brewery
another
fine
brew
from
jolly
pumpkin
i
also
got
a
chance
to
sample
this
one
on
the
4th
of
july
with
my
cousin
and
brother
the
fine
brew
poured
a
cloudy
white
head
with
a
robust
fluffy
white
head
that
lasted
for
awhile
the
aroma
i
get
is
of
a
sour
funkiness
a
bit
earthy
and
a
bit
soapy
the
taste
was
a
very
enjoyable
fruity
and
sour
mix
that
was
perfect
on
a
hot
summer
day
the
body
is
medium
with
some
good
creamy
texture
and
a
solid
carbonation
body
this
has
to
be
one
of
my
favorite
jolly
pumpkin
beers
so
far
cant
wait
to
try
the
others
drinkability
would
take
another
one
of
these
in
a
minute
very
flavorful
and
refreshing
pours
hugely
fizzy
goldenpeach
with
big
foamy
meringuelike
head
freshcut
green
apple
hop
and
spiced
alcohol
aroma
fruity
apple
and
pear
flavors
becoming
pleasingly
tangy
and
lactic
towards
the
end
a
bit
of
clove
and
pepper
alcohol
spice
and
heady
warming
in
the
finish
effervescent
medium
body
a
very
well
executed
and
pleasing
brew
probably
the
best
jolly
pumpkin
ive
sampled
so
far
a
great
summer
quencher
would
be
perfect
with
shellfish
unfortunately
it
never
does
drinkability
is
great
but
one
750ml
at
time
is
enough
notes
the
best
beer
ive
had
in
quite
some
time
off
the
top
of
my
head
remarkably
complex
highly
drinkable
as
it
doesnt
sit
and
rest
on
your
palate
but
rather
a
big
splash
of
taste
and
tart
and
then
its
gone
that
is
kind
of
the
weakest
part
of
this
beer
it
doesnt
want
you
to
drink
a
lot
of
it
the
flavor
profile
is
too
much
to
want
to
drink
a
lot
but
its
still
a
very
good
beer
for
a
wild
yeast
ride
brought
this
one
down
from
wi
back
in
early
january
and
cellared
since
pours
bright
gold
hence
the
name
with
a
short
snow
white
head
that
fades
quickly
to
a
sparse
coating
nose
is
quite
aromatic
peppery
spice
citrus
oil
wild
funky
yeast
and
a
robust
sourness
taste
follows
the
nose
sharp
and
peppery
misty
citrus
with
a
dry
funky
barnyard
yeasty
sourness
my
girlfriend
aptly
pointed
out
its
resemblance
to
a
sparkling
dry
white
wine
mouthfeel
is
crisp
tart
and
dry
only
my
second
biere
de
garde
so
im
still
a
novice
in
the
style
this
reminded
me
of
a
much
more
drinkable
version
of
the
oude
gueuze
that
i
was
not
able
to
finish
at
8
the
alcohol
creeps
up
on
you
but
is
well
hidden
within
the
funk
a
sophisticated
complex
ale
for
300
my
first
of
the
kind
and
my
first
jolly
pumpkin
it
is
very
different
considering
i
prefer
a
good
dark
thick
porter
it
pours
a
very
deep
gold
but
very
foggy
with
a
massive
white
head
that
has
a
golden
tint
smells
very
hoppy
with
many
citrus
and
yeasty
tones
tastes
mostly
citrus
to
begin
with
hints
of
alcohal
and
sour
notes
leaves
a
dry
misty
taste
with
citrus
overtones
this
beer
is
very
carbonated
and
yet
refreshing
a
decent
mouthfeel
but
nothing
that
was
unexpected
not
a
beer
that
i
could
drink
many
of
in
one
sitting
too
much
carbonation
and
very
overpowering
after
one
glass
it
is
worth
trying
definitely
not
your
typical
beer
and
something
that
can
expand
your
taste
overall
a
delicious
beer
sweet
spicy
and
very
drinkable
i
wont
be
revisiting
this
one
jolly
makes
better
brews
than
this
purchased
a
750
ml
for
7
49
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
pours
a
golden
orange
with
a
nice
fluffy
2
finger
head
smell
is
sweet
with
grapefruit
and
banana
like
qualities
spicy
mouthfeel
with
lively
carbonation
taste
starts
off
fruity
and
ends
with
a
spicy
pepper
and
kick
wonderful
head
retention
and
lacing
throughout
the
duration
of
the
drink
overall
a
very
good
product
from
jolly
pumpkin
taste
subtle
citric
flavors
with
oranges
and
lemons
and
just
a
touch
of
pineapples
theres
a
good
bready
maltiness
thats
offset
by
a
bit
of
some
tartness
the
spices
kick
in
with
coriander
and
pepper
and
finishes
a
bit
dry
with
an
interesting
oaky
earthy
mustiness
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
creamy
a
fabulous
brew
one
of
my
favorites
pours
a
gorgeous
golden
haze
an
incredibly
amount
of
froth
when
i
opened
the
bottle
and
let
it
sit
for
a
minute
it
bubbled
out
the
top
of
the
bottle
the
bubbles
in
the
head
are
massive
as
well
aroma
of
citrus
and
a
hint
of
sourness
which
is
also
what
i
get
from
the
taste
immensely
drinkable
dangerous
at
8
you
certainly
cannot
tell
from
the
taste
an
excellent
bier
de
garde
from
michigan
bright
golden
ochre
color
hazed
but
translucent
very
charged
bottle
big
snow
white
head
of
medium
bubbles
and
a
mousselike
consistency
laces
in
broad
looping
rings
a
good
aroma
tart
with
elements
of
sweet
raisins
and
a
mild
yeast
background
mouthfeel
is
almost
medium
but
theres
a
lot
of
embedded
pinprick
carbonation
crisp
flavor
with
northern
spy
apples
and
bright
white
pepper
malt
is
decent
slightly
honeyish
but
byinlarge
muted
by
the
initial
astringency
and
a
lot
of
carbonation
the
co2
will
make
you
belch
on
this
brew
unsweetened
lemon
finish
the
aroma
works
well
with
this
beer
in
some
ways
it
has
that
sharp
snap
that
approximates
one
end
of
a
spectrum
that
other
north
american
examples
leave
blank
the
latter
often
being
thicker
and
maltier
ive
never
been
a
big
biere
de
garde
fan
but
this
is
actually
pretty
good
almost
tastes
more
like
a
saison
or
triple
a
huge
mix
of
funky
flavors
which
actually
make
it
a
little
distracting
but
overall
very
nice
had
this
on
tap
at
the
hop
leaf
it
poured
a
lovely
cloudy
golden
yellow
into
a
tulip
glass
thin
head
nice
soft
carbonation
it
had
a
nice
complexity
slight
citrus
spicy
quality
hints
of
clove
nice
medium
body
there
is
ahint
of
alcohol
but
not
what
one
would
expect
with
an
8
00
this
is
my
first
jolly
pumpkin
as
well
as
my
first
biere
de
garde
but
it
will
most
definately
not
be
the
last
of
either
for
me
this
pours
into
a
tulip
glass
with
the
thick
foamy
head
that
you
expect
from
a
beligum
blonde
the
color
is
a
bright
straw
gold
the
aroma
is
honey
with
a
peppery
spiced
hops
the
flavor
is
straight
out
of
spontaneous
fermented
ale
the
tangy
tart
leave
lambic
aftertaste
but
up
front
there
is
a
spicygrassy
honey
hopped
flavor
this
is
the
closest
taste
to
orval
that
ive
had
i
think
orval
is
one
the
most
unique
flavors
in
the
world
the
bady
is
medium
and
perfect
for
the
style
every
characteristic
leads
this
brew
to
another
anytime
all
in
all
the
quality
if
very
evident
and
it
really
qualifies
as
a
craft
brew
drinkability
there
is
a
underlying
tartness
but
overall
somewhat
refreshing
an
interesting
beer
that
must
be
tried
overall
a
steal
at
the
relatively
low
price
this
one
has
me
excited
to
try
the
other
jolly
pumpkins
aroma
is
tart
and
spicy
with
mild
acidic
fruity
notes
color
is
a
a
nice
luminescent
yellow
with
a
mostly
dimniishing
white
head
lots
of
lemons
and
funkiness
in
the
fore
hints
of
pineapple
and
peppery
spices
with
a
pretty
funky
musty
finish
but
that
tart
lemony
citrus
flavors
is
what
lasts
in
the
far
aftertaste
you
wont
get
to
try
something
like
this
very
often
my
first
jolly
pumpkin
experience
has
been
very
fucking
jolly
so
far
drinkability
i
know
this
is
a
8abv
beer
in
a
750ml
bottle
but
it
feels
like
i
can
drink
this
all
day
its
not
too
expensive
7
but
i
can
see
myself
buying
more
of
this
in
the
future
cool
bottle
and
cool
beer
drinkability
quite
drinkable
another
very
nice
beer
from
jolly
pumpkin
im
amazed
were
getting
it
here
in
florida
they
dont
seem
to
brew
enough
to
ship
so
far
maybe
with
their
tropical
themes
they
feel
they
can
target
us
crackers
would
be
happy
to
have
again
but
since
it
is
not
a
todiefor
flavor
combo
for
me
i
probably
wont
buy
another
anytime
soon
for
8
despite
the
awesomelyawesomewillbeusedformynextfortyhomebrewbatches
bottle
all
in
all
very
impressive
and
very
adventurous
fruity
and
full
a
nice
strong
sipper
mouthfeel
was
like
champagne
and
i
doubt
ill
have
this
again
not
bad
though
just
not
something
to
pursue
the
taste
is
a
great
balance
of
sweet
and
tart
containing
all
elements
of
the
aroma
dries
out
in
the
end
with
a
nice
citric
funkiness
not
too
funky
just
enough
to
where
it
is
intense
interesting
and
quite
drinkable
drinkablity
sadly
for
me
this
is
so
entirely
drinkable
i
will
be
left
with
nothing
but
an
empty
but
highly
stylish
and
charactered
bottle
soon
until
next
we
meet
this
is
really
a
treasure
of
a
brew
the
picture
on
the
bottle
is
a
worth
a
thousand
words
this
is
my
first
jolly
pumpkin
beer
and
i
really
like
it
pours
a
brillent
golden
color
with
a
1
pillowy
white
head
the
aroma
is
very
belgian
with
sulphur
spice
and
alochol
the
flavor
is
malty
with
spice
and
alochol
man
this
is
a
great
beer
overall
a
unique
offering
form
a
unique
and
solid
brewery
belgianesque
in
flavor
but
different
and
unique
resembles
a
hybrid
of
belgian
pale
saison
and
a
hint
of
champagne
quite
unique
this
is
a
very
interesting
brew
very
easy
to
drink
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
i
will
work
this
into
my
regular
beer
rotation
drinkability
is
excellent
on
this
great
brew
my
favorite
from
the
brewery
thus
far
poured
a
hazy
peach
with
quick
cottony
head
malt
was
moderately
tart
much
less
so
than
in
the
other
beers
ive
had
from
jolly
pumpkin
and
better
balanced
against
the
bittering
yeasty
spicyness
was
engaging
a
nicely
done
beer
in
the
belgian
strong
pale
ale
vein
cloudy
pale
yellow
with
a
voluminous
white
head
that
stubbornly
stays
put
just
gorgeous
perfumey
grains
dominate
the
nose
with
a
peppery
dryness
the
flavors
come
across
like
a
creamy
tripel
again
with
a
peppery
finish
there
is
a
fruitiness
in
the
beginning
that
is
tasty
but
doesnt
quite
jibe
with
the
finish
this
is
an
interesting
brew
to
be
sure
the
alcohol
pokes
through
here
and
there
but
it
never
dominates
the
taste
mouthfeel
is
medium
finish
is
long
with
the
spices
and
alcohol
easy
to
drink
even
with
the
relatively
high
abv
on
the
whole
this
is
a
stunning
and
beguiling
american
farmhouse
creation
and
probably
the
closest
any
yankee
brewer
will
get
to
cloning
fantome
which
it
seems
closest
to
as
opposed
to
say
la
bav
or
3monts
or
other
classic
biere
de
gardes
but
that
statement
may
be
selling
this
short
its
no
simple
ape
character
is
paramount
edit
ive
had
a
few
more
sips
and
im
vacillating
on
the
alcohol
issue
sometimes
it
fits
right
in
and
others
im
back
to
my
original
opinion
i
must
reiterate
that
this
is
the
only
thing
preventing
oro
from
being
a
very
fine
brew
pale
yellow
with
light
cloudiness
the
fine
white
head
produced
some
very
nice
lacing
complex
yet
mild
aroma
with
light
spices
citrus
peel
and
a
bit
of
yeasty
funk
this
character
carries
through
to
the
flavour
where
the
spiciness
remains
mild
but
still
an
important
part
of
the
equation
theres
also
a
bit
of
sugary
sweetness
light
body
with
a
bit
of
dryness
very
easy
drinking
youd
never
know
it
was
8
nice
balance
too
and
it
really
grows
on
you
as
it
warms
750
ml
capped
bottle
pours
a
bright
hazy
golden
color
with
a
creamy
off
white
head
that
lasts
and
leaves
a
sticky
lacing
in
my
glass
spicy
fruity
yeasty
aroma
spicy
and
peppery
apple
pear
vanilla
and
lemon
flavors
medium
body
with
a
crisp
and
snappy
mouthfeel
finishes
spicy
and
dry
i
need
to
get
some
more
of
this
beautiful
beer
my
three
previous
jolly
pumpkin
beers
were
disappointments
at
least
relative
to
the
hype
what
i
expected
from
them
is
what
i
finally
got
from
oro
de
calabaza
this
is
an
outstanding
ale
and
instantly
joins
the
handful
of
great
belgianstyle
offerings
that
ive
had
the
pleasure
to
drink
no
matter
the
country
of
origin
a
big
thank
you
to
deejaydan
for
the
bottle
drinkability
is
great
this
was
a
suprise
and
a
treat
want
to
thank
merlin48

picking
this
up
for
me
cloudy

carbonated
though
somewhat
prickly

taste
its
clearly
there
but
its
not
as
bold
a
spice
taste
as
jenlain
not
complaining
its
a
creamy
and
easy
drink
its
a
good
one
thanks
dr
jay
for
sharing
superlative
drinkability
nice
complexity
i
could
easily
mistake
this
one
for
a
fantome
saison
in
a
blind
taste
test
exceptional
product
from
yet
another
high
quality
american
brewery
interesting
brew
it
takes
on
belgian
blonde
wit
hefe
and
chardonay
characteristics
big
estery
fruity
aromas
with
some
yeasty
bready
and
muskiness
looks

with
great

a

the
hopping
is
not

the
body
is
bubbly
and
medium
to
the
palate
mildly
numbing
and
tingly
finishes
drying
and
with
a
slight
bitealmost
astringent
a
challange
for
the
tastebuds
overall
my
first
jolly
pumpkin
beer
and
i
was
impressed
i
will
definitely
have
to
try
more
my
second
beer
from
jolly
pumpkin
poured
out
to
a
hazy
light
yellow
color
with
a
cloud
like
foamy
white
head
high
level
of
carbonation
aromas
of
vintage
cheeses
and
yeast
mixed
with
spices
and
sweet
herbs
taste
is
highly
unique
and
complex
flavors
of
malt
spice
light
pine
and
oak
grain
and
citrus
blend
in
very
nice
harmony
as
the
carbonation
keeps
the
nuances
of
earth
and
bitterness
present
toward
the
finish
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
yet
light
for
a
beer
possessing
so
much
flavor
a
decent
level
of
drinkability
this
may
not
be
an
everyday
beer
but
its
one
that
id
like
to
have
on
a
regular
basis
recommended
beer
is
good
happy
beering
quite
possibly
the
most
carbonated
beer
i
have
ever
tasted
the
carbonation
takes
some
of
the
taste
away
from
the
beer
pours
an
almost
white
i
was
startled
when
i
poured
it
the
head
rose
and
rose
and
rose
left
almost
no
lacing
on
the
glass
cloudy
yellow
in
the
glass
but
the
main
thing
is
the
carbonation
its
just
too
much
a
fine
tasting
beer
but
the
bubbles
get
in
the
way
for
the
price
i
wont
buy
it
again
i
paid
7
for
a
750ml
bottle
stone
ipa
is
much
better
and
way
cheaper
i
have
a
bottle
of
la
roja
waiting
for
tomorrow
and
im
hoping
for
better
results
just
not
my
cup
of
beer
i
love
it
when
a
beer
looks
good
and
smells
good
from
across
the
room
and
this
beer
did
not
disappoint
beautiful
white
glistening
14inch
head
that
looked
like
it
was
not
going
away
since
it
was
being
fed
by
little
fizz
bits
like
an
alka
seltzer
the
nose
was
all
belgian
goodness

candi
sugar
melon
and
honey
yum
what
a
great
beer
crisp
clean
with
a
spicy
tartness
that
lingers
on
your
palate
the
alcohol
is
evident
but
is
only
an
added
bonus
to
this
delicious
brew
rich
thick
and
oh
so
drinkable
thanks
to
jetsbeer
for
this
one
pours
a
hazy
dirtied
orange
color
with
a
3
finger
head
taht
falls
rather
slowly
to
2
fingers
as
i
pour
it
i
get
banana
aromas
taking
a
deep
inhale
off
the
glass
i
find
lemoney
and
spicey
aromas
there
are
hints
of
musty
barnyard
aromas
but
i
would
like
a
little
more
in
that
vein
the
flavor
is
interesting
i
get
lemon
slight
cidery
light
barnyard
and
even
a
touch
of
banana
very
complex
very
clean
very
good
the
feel
is
moderate
with
a
moderate
to
active
carbonation
no
hint
of
any
alcohol
in
this
highly
enjoyable
id
like
a
little
more
funk
going
on
but
i
cant
really
complain
at
all
on
this
one
id
definately
drink
it
again
pours
a
cloudy
orange
color
with
a
tall
head
that
has
great
retention
and
leaves
quite
a
bit
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
has
some
spicy
character
as
well
as
some
citrus
and
some
other
fruits
the
flavor
is
much
better
than
expected
very
tasty
some
subtle
spicing
and
lots
of
citrus
and
some
open
fermentation
funk
extremely
enjoyable
mouthfeel
is
on
the
thick
side
of
moderate
and
the
drinkability
is
very
good
mouthfeel
is
champagnelike
with
a
vigorous
carbonation
that
explodes
on
the
tongue
light
airy
and
refreshing
i
could
see
sitting
out
by
the
pool
or
beach
on
a
beautiful
day
and
enjoying
the
oro
the
entire
time
cheers
to
another
yummy
jolly
pumpkin
brew
this
is
quite
a
tasty
thing
and
i
have
another
reason
to
toast
the
fine
town
of
dexter
theyre
brewing
good
things
there
ohyeah
very
cloudy
golden
orange
body
plenty
of
white
foamy
head
covering
the
glass
in
sheets
of
lacing
big
yeasty
aroma
with
a
backing
from
various
spices
light
citrus
fruit
notes
and
a
bit
of
biscuit
flavor
starts
with
some
pears
apples
and
a
bit
of
lemon
before
the
doughy
malt
sets
in
light
funky
notes
are
there
yeast
and
spices
take
over
on
the
finish
mouthfeel
was
way
too
carbonated
to
enjoy
at
first
after
letting
it
sit
for
a
bit
it
was
less
so
drinkability
was
hurt
a
bit
by
the
over
carbonation
but
otherwise
was
good
solid
example
of
the
style
that
i
would
have
again
quite
a
treat
and
drinkable
to
boot
liked
its
overall
dulled
down
quality
while
it
still
boisterously
fulfills
and
charms
its
way
across
the
palate
with
nice
fruit
juices
and
the
fun
kick
of
dry
spice
and
heat
in
the
finish
thanks
again
tr
all
4s
drinkability
the
only
points
it
loses
here
is
for
the
size
at
750ml
this
is
meant
to
be
share
unless
you
want
a
decent
buzz
but
i
had
no
problem
finishing
most
of
a
bottle
pours
a
deep
hazy
burnt
orange
with
a
big
creamylike
head
that
settles
with
not
much
lace
behid
nice
aromas
of
tropical
fruitpineapple
mainly
and
spice
coriander
is
big
along
with
a
touch
of
cloves
different
intermingling
flavors
going
on
very
ripe
pineapple
and
cloves
dominate
with
a
faint
grassiness
but
the
overipe
pineapple
dominates
here
wow
a
big
flavorful
beer
that
takes
no
prisonerskiller
beer
that
i
will
take
back
with
me
to
nc
for
sure
finger
licking
good
this
is
the
fisrt
jolly
pumpkin
brew
ive
ver
had
if
this
is
a
representation
of
the
rest
of
thier
lineup
im
getting
some
more
this
is
a
described
golden
ale
and
pours
a
strawyellow
with
a
light
haze
it
had
a
full
head
on
pouring
and
maintained
a
thin
head
and
produced
nice
lace
all
the
way
down
the
nose
gives
uo
notes
of
citrus
flowery
herb
and
some
spice
one
may
taste
all
of
these
notes
as
well
average
to
good
mouthfeel
this
one
pours
a
nice
hazy
gold
with
a
nice
fluffy
head
that
hangs
around
for
a
long
time
it
smells
citrusy
and
spicy
there
is
definately
coriander
in
this
brew
the
taste
follows
the
nose
there
is
a
nice
citrus
flavor
with
the
light
spiciness
of
the
coriander
nice
malt
sweetness
good
mouthfeel
good
amount
of
carbonation
very
drinkable
i
highly
recommend
this
one
overall
an
interesting
take
on
the
style
out
of
all
of
the
jp
beers
id
say
that
this
is
the
one
i
liked
the
most
d
this
is
a
very
interesting
beer
if
i
didnt
have
the
bottle
in
front
of
me
i
would
call
this
a
wit
that
was
aged
in
oak
it
has
a
nice
spiciness
and
lots
of
floral
flavors
nice
beer
and
i
will
have
to
try
more
of
this
style
its
good
to
see
another
truly
artisanal
producer
out
there
if
i
could
get
this
in
ny
state
it
would
be
a
regular
in
my
fridge
this
shares
many
of
the
characteristics
of
the
luciernaga
and
the
la
roja
but
for
some
reason
it
just
seems
to
work
quite
a
bit
better
in
this
beer
this
beer
is
quite
well
integrated
between
the
up
front
apple
and
lemon
character
the
soft
spiciness
and
the
barrel
funk
there
is
a
certain
sharpness
in
the
finish
which
seems
to
have
notes
of
higher
alcohols
tannic
woodiness
and
hot
estery
alcohols
none
of
the
sharpness
in
the
finish
is
overwhelming
in
fact
it
adds
sort
of
a
balancing
note
to
the
soft
creamy
fruitiness
while
this
beer
does
not
wow
me
quite
like
the
calabaza
blanca
it
is
incredibly
well
balanced
and
certainly
tasty
to
boot
received
as
part
of
a
trade
from
crjmellor
the
750
ml
brown
bomber
was
handsome
with
a
colorful
artistic
label
when
poured
into
a
tulip
the
body
was
golden
orange
and
cloudy
and
was
capped
with
a
decent
sized
head
leaving
sticky
spotty
lace
the
smell
was
semi
tropical
in
the
vein
of
bananas
apricots
peaches
and
fresh
tilled
earth
the
taste
was
rustic
and
earthy
with
peppery
spiciness
blending
nicely
with
the
malt
that
tasted
like
buttered
french
bread
there
were
also
delicate
lemony
sour
notes
imparted
by
the
yeast
the
mouthfeel
was
creamy
and
full
with
a
dry
hoppy
and
woody
aftertaste
well
crafted
domestic
beer
that
clearly
highlights
the
old
world
origins
of
the
style
a
fine
golden
ale
nothing
spectacular
but
its
a
pretty
good
deal
at
7
09
for
a
750
good
stuff
worth
checking
out
if
you
dig
belgian
style
stuff
solid
example
of
an
underrepresented
style
at
least
in
michigan
pours
a
cloudy
straw
color
decent
head
given
the
abv
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
slightly
spicy
aroma
some
phenolics
are
present
i
pick
up
abit
of
orange
on
the
aroma
as
well
taste
start
spicy
and
full
rounding
into
ripe
citrus
fruits
and
just
a
hint
of
the
alcohol
that
is
present
full
in
the
mouthfeel
and
lush
wonderful
carbonation
i
really
like
this
style
and
this
beer
i
will
seek
it
out
again
but
i
dont
think
i
could
make
a
night
of
drinking
these
if
i
were
to
add
a
suggestion
it
would
be
for
a
slightly
fuller
malt
character
clear
amber
light
offwhite
ring
softer
aroma
than
other
jolly
pumpkin
offerings
yet
it
grows
on
you
more
vinous
than
others
it
has
a
strong
cork
flavor
to
it
bottle
has
no
cork
but
barrel
aged
musty
vinegar
flavors
vinous
earthiness
in
a
peppery
fashion
slightly
astringent
around
the
edges
and
probably
too
vinous
for
me
to
enjoy
it
as
much
as
other
jps
but
very
interesting
unique
charming
herbal
spicy
rosemary
and
lightly
meaty
even
with
a
pleasant
balsamic
touch
velvety
texture
medium
biting
carbonation
poured
into
a
rapscallion
glass
formed
a
frothy
1
14
of
creamy
offwhite
head
above
the
murky
reddish
caramelhued
brew
head
lasts
probably
due
to
continuous
streams
of
teensy
bubbles
rising
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
and
laces
well
with
foamy
bits
here
and
there
aroma
is
of
spicy
yeasts
with
slight
wood
notes
in
the
background
taste
is
smooth
spicy
pale
malts
upfront
fading
into
an
oaky
alcohol
flavor
and
then
departs
with
some
token
warming
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
both
good
with
the
mouthfeel
down
just
a
tad
because
the
barrel
notes
are
still
a
bit
biting
for
my
tastes
another
enjoyable
brew
in
the
jooly
pumpkin
stable
purchased
this
bottle
in
ann
arbor
not
far
from
the
brewery
in
december
2004
and
consumed
it
a
few
days
later
pours
a
cloudy
light
straw
color
with
a
small
amount
of
guinesslike
frothy
bubbles
that
form
a
fingerthick
mat
of
white
head
looks
like
a
belgian
white
smells
of
caramel
and
oranges
sweet
and
enticing
fine
sharp
carbonation
bites
early
with
a
closely
accompanying
malt
sweet
and
then
a
yeasty
sour
typical
of
belgians
orange
clove
woody
yuck
for
some
reason
i
had
in
my
head
that
this
would
be
a
smooth
clean
and
sweet
lager
tiny
bubbles
continue
to
stream
to
the
surface
keeping
a
complete
layer
of
head
across
the
surface
i
find
that
the
tiny
carbonation
bubbles
that
form
on
my
tongue
distract
from
the
flavor
and
mouthfeel
which
appears
to
be
medium
as
the
beer
warms
the
clove
and
yeastbready
flavors
become
stronger
a
smooth
sweet
is
present
like
the
flavor
of
a
green
melon
muskmelon
an
odd
combination
with
the
sharp
fine
carbonation
and
potent
sour
i
do
not
like
funky
belgians
and
this
beer
is
doing
nothing
to
change
that
a
complete
disappointment
but
my
scores
reflect
judgment
of
the
beer
in
relation
to
its
style
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
im
going
to
dump
a
beer
down
the
drain

was
not
impressed
with
this
this
beer
has
promise
but
as
it
is
with
the
ferment
too
warm
its
not
a
beer
i
would
care
to
have
again
if
they
cleaned
it
up
it
would
be
pretty
good
and
it
might
not
give
me
a
headache
nice
try
but
these
guys
have
to
do
their
homework
i
taste
really
ripe
watermelon
again
with
the
funky
floral
bee
pollen
apple
peels
theres
a
nice
sour
tang
balanced
with
a
bit
of
grassy
bitterness
the
yeast
it
prevalent
with
spicey
notes
and
undoubtedly
contributes
to
that
strange
flavor
from
the
nose
to
the
aftertaste
there
were
some
truly
different
aromastastes
not
unpleasant
and
worthy
of
a
revisit
but
not
in
one
sitting
note
i
opened
this
bottle
with
a
group
of
friends
som
bas
some
not
at
all
this
beer
was
liked
by
all
including
those
who
claim
to
dislike
beer
probably
because
it
was
sweet
without
much
hop
bitterness
this
beer
pours
a
murky
red
color
with
a
foamy
egg
white
head
the
nose
is
quite
strong
with
flavors
of
spice
smoke
and
burnt
residual
sugars
the
taste
has
a
very
dominant
bourbon
flavor
to
it
i
could
tell
this
was
oak
barrel
aged
at
first
sip
the
oaky
bourbon
flavor
is
strong
but
i
notice
a
mixture
of
light
and
dark
fruits
along
the
edges
and
a
decent
amount
of
tropical
spices
the
flavor
is
sweet
but
the
finish
is
dry
and
yeasty
the
finish
seems
to
be
a
bit
weak
and
the
flavors
though
having
good
depth
seem
a
little
young
i
bet
this
could
age
really
well
its
great
to
see
a
brewery
of
this
quality
in
producing
belgian
beers
come
from
michigan
murky
copper
colored
with
a
thick
but
short
lived
off
white
head
very
cloudy
and
dark
carbonation
is
moderate
aroma
is
weak
and
a
touch
musty
sweet
and
spicy
flavor
featuring
dark
fruits
and
peppery
spice
mouthfeel
would
be
dead
on
if
the
carbonation
was
a

stronger
drinkability
is

is
well
hidden

several
notes
of
flowers
hops

and
perhaps
a

a
tasty
beer
for
sure
a
rare
treat
in
these
parts
deep
golden
color
with
a
sticky

peppery
spicy
aroma
with
notes
of
yeast
and

sticky
coating
and
malty
with
some

hay
notes
and
good
hammering
of
alcohol
and
pepper
rich
in
the
mouth
with
a
nice
amount
of
tingly
carbonation
definitely
a
ringer
for
a
real
belgian
highly
enjoyable
mouthfeel
is
a
hefty
medium
it
doesnt
finish
clean
but
lingers
in
the
mouth
the
peppar
and

keep
the
inside
of
the
mouth
and
tongue
nice
and
warm
an
amazing
session
brew
for
a
chilly
october
evening
i
wish
i
had
more
thanks
to
trbeer
for
providing
us
with
this
bottle
i
first
encountered
jolly
pumpkin
at
the
michigan
summer
beer
festival
and
all
the
se
michigan
bas
especially
tim
said
this
was
one
we
should
have
gotten
our
hands
on
and
im
certainly
glad
we
did
congrats
to
jolly
pumpkin
for
a
gabf
gold
on
this
beer
belgianfrench
ale
category
and
if
you
havent
had
this
beer
get
your
hands
on
it
because
in
3
years
jolly
pumpkin
will
be
mentioned
up
there
with
allagash
and
ommegang
mark
my
words
drinkability
is
very
high
very
impressed
with
quality
and
authenticity
of
this
beer
find
these
if
you
can
jolly
pumpkin
uses
no
pumpkins
in
the
brewing
process
ron
jeffries
writes
an
honest
sentimental
and
beautiful
account
of
how
he
and
his
wife
decided
on
the
name
but
doesnt
address
this
issue
there
exists
a
somewhat
controversial
beer
genre
which
does
use
punkin
as
an
ingredient
the
fact
that
none
of
rons
beers
does
may
be
confusing
to
some
consumers
and
unfortunate
for
them
i
imagine
legions
of
belgianstyle
traditionalists
so
horrified
by
images
of
pumpkin
pie
soda
popflavored
beer
that
they
never
allow
themselves
to
encounter
this
noble
elixir
on
the
palate
it
is
bracing
lemony
acid
notes
balance
the
array
of
pure
white
sugarcotton
candy
notes
and
brown
sugar
tones
there
is
a
hint
of
bubble
gum
it
is
mouthfilling
and
not
cloying
i
noticed
an
alcohol
overtone
and
a
bit
of
nutmeg
quite
nicely
done
bright
golden
ale
with
a
dainty
white
head
the
appearance
is
just
an
illusion
however
as
the
aroma
explodes
with
spices
and
the
flavor
does
little
to
hide
the
powerful
punch
this
8
beer
provides
it
has
some
belgian
flavor
qualities
but
finishes
dry
light
and
warming
this
is
a
good
beer
but
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
this
brewery
is
a
gem
i
am
exited
to
be
able
to
buy
the
bottles
5
minutes
from
my
house
but
believe
the
short
trip
to
dexter
is
in
order
to
send
some
kudos
to
the
man
that
brewed
it
it
looks
like
honey
i
was
predicting
the
thick
flow
as
i
sup
aromas
of
pineapple
and
lime
sorbets
sandwiched
between
airy
creampuff
ends
drizzled
with
sugared
reduced
goats
milkcajeta
and
garnished
by
jessamine
ive
tasted
enough
crunchy
u
s
allmalt
belgian
styles
to
appreciate
the
balance
of
the
squash
gold
chewy
fruit
and
juniper
leather
ill
buy
the
others
unfortunately
this
beer
was
stored
on
its
side
for
a
couple
weeks
the
appearance
might
be
better
if
stored
correctly
one
of
my
favorite
beers
to
drink
on
a
regular
basis
you
could
say
i
worship
it
quite
well
done
for
the
new
guy
on
the
block
the
best
of
their
early
offerings
this
i
by
far
my
favorite
jolly
pumpkin
brew
everything
about
it
is
so
well
rounded
no
flavor
is
overpowering
yet
everything
is
well
portrayed
and
pronounced
sour
level
is
moderate
to
high
with
a
balanced
mouth
feel
strong
cider
flavors
from
yeast
nice
and
sour
but
reminded
me
of
a
flanders
red
o
a
nice
tart
beer
with
lots
of
interesting
flavors
going
on
very
smooth
and
easy
drinking
very
reminiscent
of
a
kriek
lots
of
sourness
with
a
cherry
touch
rich
body
and
lower
carbonation
tart
cherry
is
the
major
note
bitter
wash
but
not
overwhelming
thin
mouthfeel
and
the
sourness
doesnt
linger
overall
very
unique
beer
and
also
very

o

notes
that
i

type

o
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
but
knowing
how
jolly
pumpkin
does
beers
gave
me
the
courage
to
grab
a
bottle
im
glad
i
did
as
this
one
is
very
good
clear
copper
red
pour
with
a
small
white
head
light
sour
white
grape
and
woody
aroma
very
light
body
with
a
sour
cherry
and
mild
red

taste
upfront
also
has
flavors
of
orange
white
grapes
mild
caramel
malt
and
yeast
finishes
with
a
strong
and
wet
sour
flavor
oi
had
a
hard
time
getting
into
this
beer
there
is
just
so
much
going
on
that
i
am
not
sure
it
all
fits
together
between
the
tartness
that
is
typical
of
jolly
pumpkin
the
strange
malt
flavors
and
the
lighter
flavors
of
apple
and
pear
it
feels
and
tastes
a
bit
odd
to
me
oh
well
i
can
see
the
appeal
but
this
beer
is
not
for
me
i
have
always
loved
the
delicate
balance
jolly
pumpkin
has
nothing
is
over
the
top
or
intense
just
really
well
balanced
and
well
done
this
is
an
interesting
and
tasty
beer
o
an
awesome
sour
ale
to
this
point
this
might
be
one
of
my
favorite
offerings
from
jolly
pumpkin
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
great
beer
and
i
thought
it
was
a
great
example
of
a
sour
and
its
a
little
unique
for
a
jolly
pumpkin
beer
simply
because
the
funky
yeast
and
oak
barrel
were
a
little
subdued
while
the
sourness
and
fruit
flavors
were
in
the
forefront
and
i
cant
say
that
about
many
jolly
pumpkin
beers
it
may
just
be
the
sourest
beer
ive
had
from
them
this
beer
had
good
drinkability
it
was
smooth
clean
slightly
refreshing
not
too
acidic
a
little
dry
on
the
finish
just
crisp
enough
not
filling
at
all
and
the
taste
did
a
great
job
at
holding
my
attention
a
full
bottle
might
be
a
little
too
much
for
me
but
with
how
great
it
tastes
i
think
i
would
give
it
a
shot
so
i
would
say
one
bottle
is
the
perfect
amount
for
me
what
i
like
the
most
about
this
beer
was
how
well
the
sour
fruity
flavors
were
showcased
it
reminded
me
of
some
of
the
better
sours
ive
had
what
i
like
the
least
about
this
beer
was
the
appearance
it
wasnt
bad
and
i
really
liked
the
color
but
the
head
and
retention
were
a
little
disappointing
i
would
for
sure
buy
this
beer
again
its
a
little
pricey
but
i
think
its
worth
and
i
would
like
to
see
how
this
beer
changes
with
time
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
likes
sours
i
think
its
a
must
try
especially
if
your
a
jolly
pumpkin
fan
all
in
all
i
was
very
happy
with
this
beer
and
i
was
also
a
little
impressed
with
it
it
was
a
little
unique
for
a
jolly
pumpkin
and
in
the
end
it
made
for
one
tasty
beer
especially
for
the
warmer
weather
like
the
label
suggests
this
might
just
be
my
new
favorite
jolly
pumpkin
beers
ive
had
and
its
for
sure
the
sourest
one
ive
had
from
them
and
i
think
its
one
of
the
better
sours
ive
had
and
i
think
the
complexity
helped
out
with
that
great
job
guys
im
really
happy
i
tried
this
beer
and
it
turned
out
to
be
an
instant
favorite
keep
up
the
great
work
good
lots
of
mixed
floral
and
earthy
flavors

finish
medium

with
creamy

lighter
carbonation
tart
fruity
slightly

finish
liked
oro
better
but
this
is
nice
theres
a
juiciness
to
the
sour
aspect
that
translates
into
and
drives
the
mouthfeel
it
runs
dry
underneath
that
for
a
semidry
feel
overall
its
crisp
with
a
tangy
bite
to
it
as
well
jolly
pumpkin
can
do
no
wrong
for
me
this
bier
de
garde
type
is
a
little
more
straight
forward
for
me
than
some
of
their
other
stuff
but
thats
okay
its
really
expertly
made
and
really
yummy
a
copper
colored
beer
with
a
radiant
luster
small
white
fizz
head
and
a
remarkable
clarity
for
a
wild
ale
i
smell
the
classic
jolly
pumpkin
brett
and
bacterial
culture
and
a
ton
of
oak
giving
it
a
funky
sweetness
that
goes
well
with
its
robust
grain
profile
the
flavor
is
a
little
sweeter
than
i
need
it
to
be
a
mix
of
grain
and
oak
contributing
to
that
a
very
toffeelike
complexion
to
it
almost
english
in
nature
really
but
then
the
bugs
kick
in
the
beer
takes
a
hard
turn
towards
sour
with
the
acidity
really
developing
later
in
the
sip
dry
now
for
how
sweet
it
began
and
mellowed
by
a
ton
of
wood
really
earthy
and
fresh
i
could
stand
a
bit
more
carbonation
in
this
one
to
make
the
flavors
pop
a
little
more
they
all
seem
to
melt
together
just
a
little
bit
and
lose
their
individuality
which
bubbles
would
aid
in
i
think
but
i
like
the
medium
body
and
all
the
oak
on
this
clever
beer
definitely
up
to
the
high
standards
they
have
set
throughout
their
lineup
an
interesting
brew
with
hints
of
oak
cherries
tart
qualities
and
brett
funk
in
general
another
one
of
a
good
tart
and
funky
brew
from
jolly
pumpkin
overall
it
comes
across
muted
a
bit
but
its
very
easy
drinking
and
solidly
enjoyable
still
always
a
style
i
sometimes
dont
get
to
wrap
my
head
around
much
wonderful
somewhat
fruity
but
also
tart
and
just
a
tad
sour
so
the
sweetness
is
not
in
your
face
a
little
funky
too
as
other
reviewers
have
noted
smell
is
also
fruity
and
a
little
funky
lots
of
interesting
flavors
going
on
with
this
beerand
its
not
quite
like
anything
else
ive
had
recently
will
be
on
the
lookout
for
this
one
in
the
future
poured
a
nice
cloudy
amber
with
little
bits
of
yeast
floating
in
it
and
no
head
it
looks
wonderfully
rustic
and
wild
very
nice
scents
of
sour
brett
yeast
a
slight
sweet
maltiness
and
a
hint
of
cinnamon
not
the
most
intense
aroma
but
it
is
nicely
subdued
and
pleasant
flavor
begins
with
a
strong
hit
of
sour
brett
yeast
quite
apple
cider
vinegarlike
with
some
lemon
notes
the
sour
flavors
override
the
malty
base
and
make
this
quite
dry
upfront
this
opens
into
further
sour
flavors
in
the
middle
with
the
addition
of
an
excellent
oak
undertone
that
includes
hints
of
oak
and
vanilla
on
the
palette
finish
is
dry
and
sour
with
hints
of
oak
aftertaste
is
sour
and
oak
a
very
good
flavor
profile
though
not
as
malty
or
toasty
as
a
biere
de
garde
normally
is
still
quite
nice
mouthfeel
mediumlight
bodied
with
light
carbonation
and
a
drying
feel
very
nice
and
easy
to
drink
overall
this
is
an
excellent
sour
with
a
nice
bit
of
underlying
complexity
in
the
aroma
and
flavor
at
first
glance
it
seems
to
be
simply
sour
but
as
you
drink
the
character
of
the
beer
unfolds
and
becomes
nicely
complex
and
very
well
executed
its
a
very
complex
brew
with
a
gentle
friendly
tartness
with
great
fruitdark
frui
character
its
a
very
drinkable
beer
but
i
would
never
dare
to
chug
as
it
is
des
served
to
be
sipped
and
savored
great
brew
and
reminds
me
why
ron
jefferies
is
the
man
beer
is
mediumbodied
with
carbonation
of
medium
to
mediumlow
intensity
resulting
in
a
mouthfeel
that
is
softly
foamy
smooth
and
not
coarse
or
harsh
the
acidity
providing
the
major
movement
factor
for
this
beer
closes
semidry
with
low
stickiness
on
the
palate
and
lips
d
definitely
was

what
a
wonderfully
delicious
treat
and
one
of
my
favorite
non
grand
reserve
andor
super
limited
release
beers
from
jolly
pumpkin
very
drinkable
with
a
nice
tartness
that
id
place
somewhere
halfway
between
la
roja
and
the
biere
de
mars
grand
reserve
such
a
heavy
oak
presence
on
the
palate
but
it
works
to
strangely
well
i
will
be
hard
on
the
look
out
for
more
of
this
one
and
will
be
damn
sure
to
buy
as
many
bottles
as
i
can
find
each
time
it
comes
out
o
another
great
beer
from
jp
very
solid
and
consistent
across
the
grading
metrics
i
strongly
recommend
this
ale
if
you
like
jolly
pumpkin
ales
andor
sours
in
general
i
love
jp
beers
and
biere
de
mars
is
2nd
to
my
favorite
la
roja
perfect
for
a
rustic
meal
or
a
cold
day
as
the
beer
opens
this
ale
could
easily
be
confused
with
a
dry
kriek
this
is
in
no
way
a
sweet
beer
but
has
a
very
slight
sweetness
from
the
fruit
notes
likely
contributed
to
the
barrelageing
process
o
the
look
of
this
thing
got
my
hopes
up
i
was
a
really
good
biere
de
garde
and
one
of
jolly
pumpkins
best
offerings
id
be
interesting
in
trying
one
after
a
year
o
another
awesome
sour
from
jp
clean
dry
and
balanced
well
done
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
beer
was
its
aroma
things
were
just
so
funky
creamy
musky
bright
soured
and
grassy
all
while
sitting
in
the
nice
malty
base
of
a
country
ale
the
flavoring
followed
nicely
as
did
the
sip
but
the
big
boldness
of
the
nose
was
lacking
all
the
components
were
there
but
they
were
just
not
as
robust
as
we
were
hoping
through
the
flavoring
or
as
creamy
as
we
would
have
liked
on
the
sip
regardless
as
a
whole
this
is
a
fantastic
take
on
the
style
and
a
great
showcasing
of
the
tricks
punch
and
excitement
that
jolly
pumpkin
has
up
their

biere
de

pours
a
lighter
bodied
dark
amber
in
color
with
a
one
finger
very
soapy
off
white
head
the
nose
is
sharp
and
vinous
i
get
a
good
amount
of
lactic
acidity
and
a
red
grape
tannic
side
as
well
the
flavors
too
very
sharp
and
crisp
i
get
a
lot
of
sour
red
grape
character
in
both
a
lactic
and
acetic
manner
it
also
has
a
slight
juicy
fruity
sweetness
to
it
as
well
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
more
sour
jolly
pumpkins
and
definitely
one
of
the
most
acidic
because
of
this
it
isnt
quite
as
approachable
as
some
of
their
other
highly
rated
beers
but
it
is
a
nice
beer
and
a
decent
sour
really
i
would
call
this
a
darker
version
of
petrus
if
i
had
to
relate
it
to
anything
they
should
have
called
this
one
a
bam
too
because
the
whole
thing
is
just
bam
oak
all
up
in
your
mouth
which
is
okay
but
there
is
no
grace
or
style
to
it
its
somewhat
one
dimensional
and
id
have
to
say
too
strong
decent
but
lacks
finesse
overall
this
was
a
very
good
beer
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
the
funkiness
and
the
sharp
finish
that
this
beer
brought
jolly
pumpkin
keeps
on
impressing
me
imo
this
is
near
as
good
as
it
gets
awesome
sour
from
jp
keep
em
comin
only
now
to
colorado
this
brew
sets
the
benchmark
for
all
other
sours
the
only
thing
that
sucked
i
had
it
in
the
fridge
for
30
min
not
long
enough
i
forgot
that
jp
beers
are
gushers
hot
damn
overall
its
12
00
its
really
tasty
do
i
love
it
not
quite
but
i
would
definitely
pick
one
of
these
up
every
year
if
it
was
available
solid
b
o
definitely
a
winner
from
jp
i
would
love
to
try
the
grand
reserve
overall
jolly
pumpkin
makes
quite
a
few
solid
sours
and
this
falls
in
the
upper
tier
of
their
beers
only
the
biere
de

grand
reserve
can
really
compete
in
my
mind
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
rating
94
out
of
100
pretty
decent
overall
beer
is
medium
in
body
and
sour
on
the
palate
the
lactic
acid
wins
out
here
for
sure
there
is
a
mild
acetic
bite
the
whole
thing
as
well
the
finish
is
a
little
dry
overall
a
good
beer
very
drinkable
very
nice
id
have
it
again

and
quite
enjoyable
medium

i
am
thoroughly
enjoying
this
perhaps
not
as
bold
or
daring
as
the
grand
reserve
but
highly
quaffable
i
definitely
recommend
it
and
would
have
it
again
overall
great
beer
i
will
probably
try
to
snag
another
bottle
or
2
or
5
because
i
feel
this
beer
will
age
gracefully
and
become
even
more
dynamic

jp
employs
a
deft
hand
at
farmhouse
funk
with
the
majority
of
their
beers
with
so
many
turning
out
delicious
i
am
ruling
out
luck
as
a
factor
why
this
is
so
damn
tasty
next
to
la
roja
this
might
be
my
one
of
my
favorite
offerings
superb
batch
346348
one
of
the
best
regular
jolly
pumpkin
offerings
in
my
opinion
the
beer
pours
a
light
brown
color
with
a
substantial
white
head
the
smell
is
slightly
sour
with
a
little
bit
of
funk
thrown
in
to
the
mix
the
taste
is
similar
with
a
slightly
sour
start
to
the
sip
finished
off
by
a
little
funkiness
that
isnt
to
over
the
top
you
can
also
pick
out
a
little
oak
in
the
finish
rather
light
on
the
pallet
which
is
nice
during
the
summer
in
florida
overall
a
winner
that
i
would
return
to
regularly
if
were
a
little
less
expensive
batch
346348
poured
into
lost
abbey
stemware
pours
a
dark
brown
color
that
is
a
beautiful
reddishpurple
when
held
up
to
light
it
had
a
large
offwhite
head
that
hangs
around
for
a
very
long
time
beautiful
head
on
this
beer
scent
was
extremely
funky
from
the
second
i
popped
the
cap
gotta
love
that
jp
signature
funk
i
also
get
a
lot
of
oak
and
wood
aromas
with
some
sweet
fruits
and
hints
of
vanilla
taste
is
damn
i
love
jp
more
and
more
with
each
of
their
beers
i
try
initially
i
get
tart
cherry
flavors
immediately
followed
by
belgian
yeast
barnyard
funk
and
tons
of
oak
the
sweet
fruity
flavors
in
the
beginning
are
amazing
and
somewhat
vinous
then
all
the
oak
and
vanilla
comes
in
and
just
blows
my
palate
away
mouthfeel
is
very
fullbodied
and
creamy
drinkability
is
very
high
with
no
detectible
alcohol
flavors
overall
this
is
another
amazing
beer
from
jolly
pumpkin
these
guys
are
becoming
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
by
far
o
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
i
recommend
trying
it
if
you
get
the
chance
not
sure
id
buy
it
again
however

2011
overall
i
prefer
fresh
to
vintage
this
is
by
far
superior
in
taste
and
in
the
nose
it
offers
so
much
fruitiness
spicyness
and
depth
i
love
this
biere
o
overall
quite
good
im
going
to
the
release
of
the
grand
reserve
next
week
and
am
quite
excited
given
how
tasty
the
base
beer
is
750
ml
bottle
poured
into
a
large
snifter
this
is
a
clear
translucent
brown
color
extremely
well
carbonated
with
a
champagnelike
fizziness
smell
is
sour
and
funky
with
lots
of
lemon
barnyard
and
blue
cheeseish
qualities
taste
is
a
sour
pungent
lemon
very
acidic
and
very
drinkable
this
is
delicious
jolly

is
a
great
brewery
for
sour
beers

tart
with
some

lots

yeasty

flavour
has
a
very
mild
sourness
but
there
is
a
very
big
malty
flavour
to
this
beer
as
well
aftertaste
seems
to
be
mostly
sour
with
my
mouth
puckering
somewhat
fairly
big
carbonation
level
another
nice
beer
from
this
brewery
d
an
enjoyable
glass
i
wouldnt
mind
returning
to
this
one
again
in
the
future
when
im
feeling
something
sour
mouthfeel
drinkability
as
stated
slightly
more
sour
than
sweet
a
very
awesome
tasting
and
well
balanced
beer
slightly
more
the
red
ale
and
darker
tasting
side
of
j
p
beers
this
reminds
me
even
further
of
why
jolly
pumpkin
is
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
this
is
the
first
beer
i
have
had
in
the
style
tastes
almost
wine
like
the
tartness
is
so
interesting
to
me
this
beer
is
a
greater
sipper
overall
this
one
is
well
worth
a
try
these
types
of
beers
are
so
far
left
than
many
of
the
other
styles
that
they
are
just
fun
to
drink
this
is
hands
down
my
favorite
jolly
pumpkin
beer
the
flavor
funk
and
tartness
are
everything
i
want
out
of
a
jp
beer
this
is
so
good
d
overall
i
think
the
sourness
covers
up
a
lot
of
the
other
flavors
nearly
all
the
oak
character
is
covered
up
by
the
sourness
as
i
continue
to
drink
i
can
pick
up
a
bit
more
of
what
the
beer
beneath
the
sour
is
but
i
still
think
this
could
be
nearly
any
base
beer
and
many
people
wouldnt
be
able
to
pull
out
the
original
style
its
good
but
i
think
this
degree
of
sour
muddles
up
anything
that
the
base
beer
was
i
enjoy
it
but
i
probably
wouldnt
get
it
again
pours
a
dark
ruddy
brown
with
hints
of
amber
and
purple
nose
reveals
the
sharp
sourness
which
has
a
bit
of
funk
and
vingar
like
quality
that
matches
wits
with
a
caramel
and
toffee
base
loads
of
dark
fruits
hint
of
cocoa
light
roast
a
little
acidic
and
sharp
for
my
liking
lacking
the
integration
of
many
of
jps
other
offerings
a
little
too
sharp
carbonation
which
presents
the
beer
as
thinner
than
it
is
just
wasnt
that
drinkable
for
me
pours
a
hazy
brown
almost
an
amber
color
with
good
head
and
some
lace
the
aroma
is
very
funky
with
cheese
horse
blanket
sour
cherry
and
some
bread
the
flavor
is
very
sour
with
some
lemon
peel
and
is
well
balanced
with
a
good
strawberry
and
fruity
character
the
beer
is
dry
and
oaky
and
has
some
vinous
notes
beautiful
pours
a
rich
honey
brown
with
a
finger
of
creamy
head
that
put
down
some
nice
lace
spots
caramel
earth
and
funk
on
the
nose
along
with
very
light
vinegar
notes
interesting
flavour
surprisingly
malty
with
caramel
and
cocoa
notes
that
provide
a
decent
sweetness
a
light
funky
acidity
lurks
underneath
but
doesnt
seem
as
pronounced
as
others
indicate
other
batches
have
been
medium
body
and
carbonatio
work
well
for
me
yum
this
beer
is
a
sipper
it
took
me
about
an
hour
and
a
half
to
get
the
bottle
down
and
i
did
in
fact
enjoy
it
the
smell
was
beautiful
and
it
did
taste
great
my
only
beef
with
this
is
i
feel
that
it
is
too
hard
to
take
down
a
bottle
i
did
enjoy
it
a
great
deal
but
i
felt
that
it
was
a
bit
too
alcoholic
for
the
style
i
would
have
enjoyed
a
smaller
serving
but
next
time
i
will
probably
split
this
a
little
pricey
but
for
sure
worth
trying
drinkability
good
i
would
certainly
try
this
one
again
d
i
really
liked
this
beer
the
sourness
is
just
enough
not
too
strong
but
still
there
through
the
whole
beer
its
a
very
refreshing
beer
lots
of
juicy
fruits
drinkability
i
love
the
flavors
and
the
refreshing
tartness
its
not
overpoweringly
sour
or
funky
a
solid
body
with
a
little
weight
that
isnt
killing
the
stomach
the
acidity
gets
to
be
a
little
much
after
a
while
but
it
is
still
most
definitely
enjoyable
yet
another
solid
offering
from
jp
cheers
and
mahalo
drinkability
at
first
i
thought
this
beer
was
only
ok
but
then
i
realized
that
this
is
a
beer
takes
some
getting
used
to
i
have
the
suspicion
that
its
the
type
of
beer
that
will
grow
on
me
over
time
i
certainly
intend
to
revisit
this
beer
to
see
if
i
like
it
better
or
less
the
next
time
around
balanced
by
black
pepper
funky
brettanomyces
and
applecherry
tartness
the
finish
is
yeasty
and
lingering
with
a
bracing
sour
bite
all
in
all
this
is
a
terrific
beer
it
would
be
a
good
introduction
to
real
lambics
since
it
has
some
of
the
same
characteristics
but
is
a
bit
more
restrained
than
many
of
the
lambics
that
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
tasting
passingly
paired
this
beer
with
turtle
cheesecake
and
tiramisu
desserts
from
an
italian
restaurant
we
were
eating
paired
well
with
the
bretty
and
acetic
complexity
of
the
beer
balancing
the
sweet
and
creamy
attributes
of
the
desserts

head
head
retention
is
low
not
much
lacing
either
aroma
is
nice
and
tart
the
brew
smells
like
tart
apples
vinegar
funk
cherries
and
an
earthy
aroma
it
tastes
pretty
much
just
like
the
aroma
but
with
the
addition
of
some
oak
peppery
spice
and
some
grapesred
wine
the
tartsour
taste
is
the
most
noticable
out
of
all
the
flavors
which
is
definitely
a
good
thing
for
me
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
a
bit
dry
and
has
moderate
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
its
easy
to
drink
and
i
enjoyed
it
overall
i
think
this
is
a
good
brew
its
definitely
worth
a
try
drinkability
this
would
have
to
be
a
weekend
beer
for
me
given
the
volume
and
abv
this
was
a
really
well
put
together
beer
though
it
doesnt
punch
you
in
the
face
with
flavor
but
its
a
great
beer
to
sip
on
and
all
the
characteristics
of
the
beer
keep
things
fun
and
enjoyable
thanks
for
sharing
mike
the
second
of
many
at
what
ended
up
being
tuesday
night
jolly
pumpkin
bonanza
sampled
side

with
the
reserve
version
not
as
cloudy
as
the
reserve
and
pours
deep
mahogonyamber
with
medium
beige
froth
after
a
minute
looks
like
a
barley
wine
more
subtle
in
aroma
than
reserve
less
booze
and
more
fruit
lots
of
apples
pear
with
mild
hints
of
caramel
and
a
funk
that
is
not
as
pronounced
very
tart
with
super
bretty
funk
taste
and
lots
of
yeast
strange
fruitty
bitter
flavours
too
that
last
through
the
finish
very
soft
and
silky

from

thanks
mike
d
ive
been
nursing
on
this
bottle
for
close
to
three
hours
and
im
still
digging
it
the
citrus
sharpness
becomes
more
pronounced
as
time
passes
giving
the
ale
a
nice
bite
tasty
but
esoteric
challenging
one
is
good
two
would
be
overkill
im
not
so
sure
id
be
able
to
taste
a
second
anyway
im
looking
forward
to
enjoying
my
remaining
bottle
sometime
soon
d
pretty
drinkable
pretty
tasty
edit
as
odd
as
this
seems
i
had
a
piece
of
strawberry
filled
dark
chocolate
godiva
with
this
and
it
was
utterly
amazing
the
two
went
together
superbly
batch

costly
at

and
bought
in
detroit
suburb
oh
well
i
guess
they
could
use
the
stimulus
nice
color
deep
ruby
brown
smell
is
very
astringent
like
a
sour
taste
is
pretty
good
although
nothing
like
i
expected
by
reading
the
style
listed
on
the
bottle
and
written
in
beer
advocate
the
bottle
reads
french
style
stock
ale
sounds
fairly
unassuming
and
expected
it
to
taste
like
a
french
farmhouse
ale
it
doesnt
it
tastes
like
a
sour
but
more
complex
i
think
the
aging
in
oak
barrels
makes
this
a
much
more
drinkable
beer
and
the
taste
is
unique
and
complex
the
aftertaste
follows
that
theme
and
although
this
is
a
tasty
beer
and
more
drinkable
than
a
typical
sour
im
thinking
flemish
sour
flanders
style
with
wild
yeast
its
a
beer
to
be
savored
and
shared
ideally
while
this
may
not
be
something
i
seek
out
every
day
its
greatly
appreciated
this
is
a
clear
case
of
the
whole
being
greater
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
quite
well
done
drink
excellent
just
enough
sour
tart
refreshingness
to
kill
most
of
a
bottle
d
like
most
other
jolly
pumpkin
beer
if
i
had
to
choose
the
only
beer
i
could
drink
again
i
would
be
hard
pressed
not
to
choose
it
the
people
at
jolley
pumpkin
make
some
of
the
best
beers
out
there
worth
hunting
down
to
try
hazy
burgundy
appearance
with
a
lasting
cap
of
pure
white
good

and

really

it

lactic

unripened

mild

perfect
on
a
day
like
this
just
the
job
tannic
vinous
finish
another
excellent
beer
from
this
great
brewery
a
great
beer
wonderful
fizzy
carbonation
and
downright
drinkable
the
wife
didnt
care
for
it
considered
it
too
belgiany
oh
well
she
found
herself
an
ipa
so
shes
set
overall
an
interesting
brew
worth
trying
sort
of
like
a
wildalesaison
hybrid
smooth
easy
drinker
medium
bodied
with
the
typical
jp
carbonation
my
first
biere
de
garde
and
it
was
a
good
one
im
enjoying
this
beer
to
bits
really
complex
and
impressive
in
flavour
yet
very
pleasant
and
drinkable
with
a
great
palate
profile
a
refreshing
and
complex
beer
very
pleasant
indeed
with
plenty
to
keep
me
interested
supremely
drinkable
for
its
complexity
its
like
the
layers
are
there
to
discover
if
you
so
desire
otherwise
it
can
be
enjoyed
as
a
refreshing
rustic
brew
very
jolly
indeed
a
refined
sour
that
tastes
much
like
an
oud
bruin
the
beer
pours
a
reddish
brown
color
with
amber
highlights
and
a
dissipating
head
that
leaves
little
lacing
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
fruity
lemons
apples
grapes
barley
the
flavor
is
rich
and
deeper
than
expected
theres
a
medium
acidity
with
a
healthy
oak
flavor
the
flavors
meld
quite
well
for
an
oud
bruin
but
i
really
havent
had
many
the
feel
is
relatively
light
the
alcohol
is
wellhidden
its
another
sour
that
makes
me
wish
sours
were
cheap
and
plentiful
because
i
could
drink
it
all
night
its
a
decent
beer
not
great
but
it
would
be
mind
blowingly
good
if
not
for
that
damn
after
taste
pours
a
very
dark
brown
pruney
almost
odd
for
a
bdm
or
bdg
slight
head
quickly
dissipates
smells
hugely
vinegaric
like
an
absolute
sour
bomb
with
nothing
else
in
it
like
a
oud
bruin
with
no
balance
to
it
whatsoever
no
malt
for
balance
wearily
i
try
a
sip
it
goes
beyond
vinegaric
to
downright
offensive
with
this
style
though
i
dont
know
if
they
were
shooting
for
a
sour
bomb
or
if
it
has
an
infection
given
the
yeasts
they
go
for
i
think
i
made
it
about
3
sips
with
this
before
drainpouring
the
rest
im
going
to
check
into
it
and
will
edit
the
review
if
it
is
not
supposed
to
be
like
this
notes
not
the
best
jp
offering
by
any
means
and
certainly
not
your
typical
biere
de
garde
it
ends
up
being
relatively
enjoyable
especially
sniffing
it
why
did
it
take
this
long
to
show
up
in
massachusetts

since
i
usually
dont

that
amount
up
call
me
a
sucker
for
oakaged
beers
brewed
with
wild
yeast
but
ive
been
working
my
way
through
the
jolly
pumpkin
line
and
enjoying
every
sip
so
far
this
brewery
has
unique
written
all
over
it
each
beer
having
its
own
personality
initially
surpised
by
the
darkness
of
the
pour
a
ruddy
brown
yet
clear
to
the
light
ruby
edging
and
a
short
lived
head
smell
is
lively
and
full
of
yeasty
bugs
strong
oak

fruit
cherry
and
crab
apple
wow
i
was
sort
of
expecting
a
more
carbonated
and
lighter
biere
de
garde
but
this
is
one
of
those
noncategory
hybrid
beers
almost
like
a
dryer
sour
brown
ale
zesty
wild
yeast
plays
big
here
out
front
with
a
nice
mellow
fruityness
as
the
body
of
the
beer
finishes
pleasantly
sour
and
with
huge
oak
and
dry
woody
tannins
really
excellent
perfect
with
food
though
not
as
carbonated
as
i
expected
this
brew
proves
to
be
very
refreshing
and
a
different
twist
on
the
style
once
again
im
not
surprised
to
be
surprised
by
another
great
offering
from
ye
jolly
scalawags
beer
pours
a
burgundy
color
into
my
rochefort
chalice
smell
is
cherries
and
brett
yeast
taste
is
similar
with
some
sourness
a
more
mellow
version
of
the
duchesse
very
easy
to
drink
with
no
alcohol
presence
i
enjoyed
this
beer
quite
a
bit
but
it
didnt
knock
my
socks
off
d
i
find
this
beer
to
be
pretty
damn
drinkable
this
beer
simply
blew
me
away
i
love
jolly
pumpkin
this
one
may
be
the
best
beer
that
ive
tried
from
them
so
far
highly
recommended
this
beer
is
a
delicate
easy
drinking
slightly
sour
offering
from
jolly
pumpkin
one
heck
of
an
ale
i
wish
there
were
more
american
breweries
like
jolly
pumpkin
mediumlow
carbonation
with
a
semidry
finish
quite
easy
to
drink
highly
recommended
this
beer
is
drinkable
i
was
definitely
happy
with
this
one
and
will
probably
buy
it
again
pours
a
hazy
orangish
color
with
a
beige
head
the
nose
has
oak
tart
fruits
manure
and
candy
malts
the
taste
was
well
balanced
but
could
have
used
more
of
a
baryard
funk
presence
medium
body
is
well
carbonated
a
good
beer
from
jolly
pumpkin
pairs
well
with
aged
cheese
i
would
recommend
this
to
a
freind
as

of
my

to

for

overall
i
was
ok
with
spending
this
much
money
on
a
beer
from
a
brewery
that
i
wasnt
overly
impressed
with
previously
ill
be
sure
to
try
more
of
their
beers
after
this
and
you
should
too
d
i
could
probably
drink
anything
from

for
the
rest
of
my
life

oro

another
decent
jp
beer
thats
a
bit
too
heavy
on
the
lactic
for
my
tastes
i
love
the
sour
and
acidic
beers
but
the
lactic
quality
here
cuts
down
on
the
drinkability
damn
tasty
brew
not
the
most
complex
and
a
little
pricey
but
well
worth
a
shot
if
you
see
it
d
still
a
really
good
tasting
beer
didnt
seem
as
unique
as
most
jp
beers
but
it
was
still
enjoyable
biere
de
mars
is
another
high
quality
beer
from
jolly
pumpkin
that
i
wouldnt
hesitate
to
pick
up
again
they
have
the
sour
aspects
of
their
beers
down
to
a
science
and
they
all
seem
to
be
within
moderation
unfortunately
its
getting
harder
and
harder
to
find
their
beers
around
these
parts
it
seems
like
theyre
just
not
on
the
shelves
anymore

the

is
a

in
your

i
kept
wondering
if
it
was
cornbased
giving
it
a
bourbonesque
mouthfeel
jolly
pumpkin
im
told
uses
wild
yeast
and
oak
barrels
that
might
account
for
the
strong
flavour
i
thought
i
detected
a
sour
rottenfruit
backdrop
but
with
a
redeeming
fruitcake
presence
as
well
overall
another
interesting
offering
from
a
fine
michigan
brewery
recommended

courtesy
of
secret

poured
a
clean
copper
color
ale
with
a
large
foamy
head
with
good

and
good

aroma
is
zesty
orangey
and
very
funky
taste
is
also
a
typical
jp
mix
between
some
orange
lightly
sweet
lemon
with
some
distinctive
barnyard
and
bretty
notes
i
think
i
detect
some
spices
but
there
are
not
too
prominent
and
might
come
from
the
yeast
used
in
this
beer
full
body
with
good
carbonation
and
no
distinctive
alcohol
very
well
done
again
from
a
brewer
that
just
cant
stop
to
amaze
me
pours
a
hazy
copper
orangeish
with
a
light
tan
head
in
the
aroma
oak
cherry
and
vanilla
in
the
taste
somewhat
smokey
and

flavor
as
well
a
sour

and

with
a

i
think
i
have
ever
had
exceptional
2007
autumn
colored
with
a
lasting
foam
that
forms
great

nose
has
some

a

be
more
vibrant
flavor
is
nicely
balanced
brett
oak
funk
some

with
a
bit
of
an
unpleasant
cooked
corn
note
as
well
just
ok
im
not
the
biggest
jp
fan
all
their
beers
taste
the
same
drinkability
not
my
style
at
all
as
far
as
the
style
goes
it
holds
its
own
should
defenitely
not
be
a
stopping
point
for
the
average
drinker
know
the
style
before
drinking
d
overall
a
sour
beer
im
no
fan
of
this
style
i
guess
you
really
have
to
like
sour
beer
to
enjoy
this
i
sure
didnt
d
a
little
heavy
on
the
sweet
and
sour
this
is
definitely
a
sipper
d
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
the
bottle
is
not
hard
to
finish
at
all
but
i
think
it
would
really
be
one
of
those
beers
that
you
either
like
or
hate
you
have
to
like
the
tart
and
brett
taste
of
this
one
to
enjoy
this
beer
if
you
dont
like
those
flavors
i
would
avoid
this
all
together
fortunately
i
like
tart
and
funk
so
i
think
this
is
a
good
beer
reminds
me
a
bit
of
the
la
red
poppy
even
though
they
are
completely
different
styles
this
beer
is
wonderful
not
for
everyone
but
very
balanced
and
interesting
get
a
round
of
brie
and
some
water
crackers
drinkability
for
most
hardly
any
but
for
me
well
i
could
drink
this
all
day
long
sadly
i
cant
be
doing
that
with
rons
new
pricing
structure
i
may
snag
another
for
aging
purposes
though
im
sure
this
beer
for
aging
will
age
quite
well
overall
a
darker
funky
jolly
pumpkin
good
but
not
my
favorite
d
i
like
this
beer
it
pails
in
comparison
to
other
jp
beers
i
have
had
but
that
is
entirely
relative
they
make
incredible
beer
drinkability
ill
be
sad
when
this
one
is
gone
as
i
cannot
remember
where
i
got
it
its
been
in
my
cellar
for
a
while
and
i
havent
seen
it
recently
beautiful
deep
cherry
color
translucent
near
the
bottom
and
becoming
darker
near
the
thick
creamy
head
oak
on
the
nose
with
huge
belgian
floral
notes
coming
through
with
the
first
sip
lots
of
sourness
with
cherry
bitter
unripened
peach
ans
spice
in
the
background
appears
a
burgundy
burnt
caramel
amber
hue
with
a
large
tan
beige
head
forming
with
fine
even
lacing
around
my
glass
of
course
tiny
bubbles
cling
to
the
glass
and
head
has
nice
retention
with
even
belgian
style
lacing
left
behind
on
my
chalice
aromatics
bring
tart
with
spicy
funk
reminiscent
jolly
pumpkin
tones
but
the
tart
aspect
rains
supreme
and
brings
with
it
some
fruity
vinous
notes
combining
a
cherry
and
raisin
nose
about
it
of
course
the
wood
aging
and
spice
additions
openly
fermented
all
way
into
the
wave
of
different
characteristics
this
beer
is
capable
of
flavors
a
blend
of
sweet
lactic
tinged
cherry
juice
with
oak
barrel
woody
and
pine
notes
coming
out
underlying
spice
and
horse
blanket
funk
and
yogurt
like
tang
really
a
fine
beer
by
the
way
you
almost
need
cheese
and
crackers
to
pair
with
this
beer
it
really
cuts
through
it
all
quite
nicely
if
any
hops
are
detectable
they
come
off
like
herbal
earthy
cherry
pits
by
the
way
this
stuff
goes
so
well
with
food
completely
clears
all
fat
from
the
palate
mouthfeel
is
fine
bubble
carbonation
streaking
effortlessly
leaving
a
dry
tart
lactic
tone
on
my
tongue
sounds
not
so
good
right
but
when
it
comes
down
to
it
this
characteristic
blends
so
well
with
so
many
other
familiar
flavors
that
im
not
accustomed
to
drinkability
is
really
effortless
the
bottle
drains
itself
just
pair
this
fine
brew
with
some
food
and
everything
will
come
together
for
you
definitely
a
delicious
brew
that
im
ready
to
handle
any
time
worth
the
hype
on
this
one
i
still
love
jolly
pumpkin
like
the
first
time
i
tasted
their
beers
now
thats
love
d
another
tasty
funky
beer
from
jp
the
taste
is
acidic
up
front
tart
and
sharp
and
full
of
funk
and
cheesiness
melds
nicely
into
a
balancing
apple
sweetness
theres
lots
of
woody
oaky
notes
as
well
with
a
hint
of
vanilla
very
pleasant
spicy
hop
notes
peppery
and
herbal
meld
into
a
surprising
bitterness
in
the
finish
and
a
hint
of
mellow
malty
sweetness
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
mellow
carbonation
thats
just
about
right
a
little
sticky
but
not
super
dry
this
a
nice
sipper
for
a
chilly
spring
evening
and
one
id
like
to
have
again
in
the
future
pours
out
a
hazy
to
cloudy
honeyed
amber
body
with
a
thick
full
head
and
tons
of
bubble
action
in
the
body
leaves
a
lot
of
lacing
smells
of
faint
crackery
malts
and
caramel
tones
underneath
loads
of
funk
fruitiness
and
spiciness
i
get
lots
of
fresh
apples
apple
cider
and
apple
cider
vinegar
here
yeast
gives
this
a
spiciness
with
tones
of
clove
and
ceylon
cinnamon
i
pick
up
some
oranges
as
well
flavor
is
kind
of
thin
in
the
malt
department
extremely
dry
what
subtle
caramel
and
toasted
malt
qualities
i
got
in
the
nose
are
even
more
muted
here
kind
of
like
this
has
funk
for
funks
sake
and
it
doesnt
mesh
as
well
as
with
their
other
beers
has
a
weird
acrid
bitterness
in
the
finish
has
quite
a
medicinal
lingering
effect
mouthfeel
is
light
and
spritzy
i
usually
love
jps
offerings
but
im
quite
disappointed
in
this
one
maybe
fresher
would
be
better
for
these
but
for
a
beer
touting
itself
as
a
stock
ale
i
would
expect
better
from
a
beer
having
been
aged
for
a
year
under
good
conditions
d
this
beer
has
a
really
nice
balance
of
grapefruit
and
funk
with
all
of
the
flavors
well
blended
and
a
bit
mysterious
this
beer
makes
me
urn
for
spring
and
the
warm
months
of
sipping
great
beers
poured
into
my
darkness
goblet
first
off
bottle
wasnt
a
gusher
so
thats
a
minor
victory
ok
now
what
do
we
have
dark
reddish
oak
colour
with
excellent
clarity
and
fluffy
off
white
head
nice
silky
lacing
nose
a
big
whiff
of
that
classic
jp
funk
and
woodiness
taste
rich
wood
and
earthiness
brett
presence
is
felt
but
overwhelming
sourness
green
apple
crab
apple
very
dry
finish
from
the
wood
and
some
hops
show
up
as
well
reminds
of
fantome
brew
various
spices
in
flavour
that
i
cant
pick
out
the
wood
has
really
imparted
a
lot
of
flavour
and
character
into
this
carbonation
is
spritzy
and
drinkability
is
high
very
addictive
and
just
great
stuff
plan
and
simple
pours
chestnut
with
a
great
head
that
sticks
around
great
lacing
as
well
aromas
of
sour
lemon
and
a
light
graininess
as
well
as
sour
orange
and
a
touch
of
wood
the
taste
is
similar
very
drinkable
with
evolving
complex
flavors
of
sour
and
bitter
and
light
overtones
of
oak
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
a
bit
creamy
the
carbonation
is
restrained
enough
the
body
is
light
enough
and
the
flavor
profile
is
refreshing
enough
that
you
could
just
suck
this
one
down
d
very
refreshing
and
drinkable
quite
reminiscent
of
orval
but
with
a
more
pronounced
sourness
drinkability
as
always
its
another
weird
wild
ride
from
jolly
pumpkin
drinkable
eh
you
can
drink
it
and
finish
its
not
a
dumper
another
outstanding
offering
by
jolly
pumpkin
this
beer
may
be
the
funkiest
beer
of
the
beers
that
i
have
had
the
privilage
of
sampling
the
beer
fills
the
nose
with
a
mix
of
malt
sweetness
soured
malts
and
a
firm
spicy
woody
note
very
peppery
tart
fruity
and
musty
throughout
the
look
is
a
typical
rusty
hue
moderate
haze
from
sediment
and
very
well
headed
and
constant
lacing
flavors
alternate
between
estery
fruits
malt
sweetness
and
bretnomyces
sourness
no
attribute
dominates
the
brew
but
complements
it
fully
phenols
gain
precedence
as
the
beer
warms
and
also
adds
complexity
without
detering
from
the
other
flavors
nicely
bitter
to
round
out
the
sourness
and
offset
any
sweetness
much
bitter
and
spiciness
comes
from
the
wood
and
not
so
much
from
the
hops
finishes
warm
dry
and
with
a
partwood
partfruit
lingering
a
seriously
good
offering
from
a
seriously
good
brewery
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
very
soft
and
smooth
with
a
very
good
drinkability
this
would
almost
work
as
a
session
beer
for
me
if
i
really
did
that
i
will
definitely
be
seeking
this
one
out
again
the
next
time
im
in
michigan
goes
down
way
smoother
than
it
should
i
could
drink
this
all
day
long
the
body
is
light
as
should
be
with
most
belgian
carbonation
mixes
well
and
enhances
the
tart
quality
overall
this
just
feels
off
style
but
what
is
on
style
for
belgian
beers
pours
beautiful
cloudy
copper
brown
with
mammoth
long
lasting
tan
head
that
you
are
forced
to
drink
through
fragrant
with
sour
oak
earth
yeast
and
wine
flavor
is
layered
and
complex
an
initial
touch
of
hop
gives
way
to
a
sour
wine
and
oak
center
the
finish
becomes
bone
dry
with
big
helpings
of
yeast
grainy
coarseness
and
black
pepper
body
is
surprising
in
its
relative
lightness
with
wonderful
smooth
creaminess
and
bubbly
zing
great
job
jolly
pumpkin
the
moment
of
truth
amazing
taste
surprisingly
citrusy
tang
cloves
and
corriander
banana
slight
touch
of
hops
bits
of
alcohol
a
nutty
taste
almonds
and
cashews
also
an
overtone
of
oak
coming
through
pretty
awesome
flavor
sort
of
light
bodied
but
with
some
kick
to
it
moderate
carbonation
kind
of
buzzes
in
your
mouth
this
accompanied
by
an
alcohol
warmth
makes
for
quite
the
experience
this
is
one
of
the
most
enjoyable
beers
ive
ever
had
other
than
oro
de
calabaza
another
biere
de
garde
and
bam
biere
saison
i
havent
been
thrilled
with
jolly
pumpkin
artisan
ales
biere
de
mars
gets
thing
back
on
track
maybe
the
difference
is
that
i
want
and
expect
sour
funk
in
beer
of
this
style
i
dont
want
it
nor
do
i
expect
it
in
every
single
style
in
any
case
this
one
is
definitely
worth
a
purchase
great
label
as
always
pours
a
dark
amber
color
nice
half
inch
head
on
top
of
the
glass
smell
is
funky
like
a
monkey
jolly
pumpkin
is
rapidly
becoming
my
favorite
brewery
plenty
of
spice
in
this
beer
maybe
a
little
too
much
carbonation
would
be
my
only
complaint
anyhow
a
very
good
beer
i
just
wished
for
a
bit
more
malt
body
on
this
one
that
said
i
would
buy
another
on
my
next
big
beer
run
not
as
full
and
round
as
anticipated
mid
palate
is
substantially
thin
some
floral
aspects
and
spritzy
carbonation
funky
and
lively
spicey
apple
flavors
with
a
berry
nut
mix
some
delicate
new
oak
on
the
finish
very
good
but
missing
something
in
that
mid
palate
good
body
fluffy
soft
carbonation
not
my
favorite
from
jolly
pumpkin
but
still
good
lively
carbonation
with
a
heavy
yeast
earthy
flavor
also
had
a
light
fruittart
flavor
this
beer
went
down
very
easy
drinkability
is
very
high
in
my
opinion
this
is
one
of
the
better
belgian
style
beers
being
made
by
a
u
s
brewery
mouth
medium
carbonation
some
lingering
sweetness
one
can
enjoy
this
easily
with
dinner
or
sipping
slowly
in
the
company
of
friends
just
dont
expect
it
to
blow
you
mind
or
bust
your
tastebuds
in
10
or
12
new
ways
revisiting
the
2007
thanks

this
is
a
different
beast
from
when
i
had
it
fresh
initial
pour
yeilds
a
brief
but
substantial
head
lovely
color
which
holds
on
to
a
skim
of
foam
and
lacing
sourness
in
the
aroma
has
mellowed
and
the
predominant
smell
is
sweaty
leather
yum
huh
yeah
it
is
mouthfeel
is
so
much
smoother
with
no
appearant
carbonation
yet
there
was
that
head
tastes
indulgent
and
only
slightly
sour
but
funky
and
beautiful
i
am
going
to
make
it
a
point
to
try
and
hold
on
to
jp
beers
now
this
one
aged
beautifully
with
a
noticable
change
in
both
body
and
aroma
p
s
love
the
label
overall
impression
definitely
an
interesting
offering
i
would
rate
it
short
of
great
but
it
is
very
good
overall
this
was
only
my
second
biere
de
garde
and
first
biere
de
mars
but
i
have
to
say
that
i
was
thoroughly
impressed
great
aromatics
and
great
flavors
that
were
big
but
not
overwhelming
delicious
and
drinkable
smells
acidic
like
tomatos
or
ketchup
slight
bit
of
oak
and
funk
smells
really
good
tart
but
not
sour
very
easy
to
drink
subtle
flavors
might
be
better
fresh
but
it
holds
up
well
after
20
months
or
so
overall
this
one
kind
of
took
me
by
surprise
i
didnt
really
know
what
to
expect
but
the
sourness
is
not
over
the
top
and
the
oak
balance
is
way
above
par
there
isnt
anything
to
hate
in
this
one
extremely
drinkable
and
remarkably
complex
overall
a
decent
beer
so
far
its
my
least
favorite
jp
beer
i
wouldve
like
to
see
a
little
more
sourness
and
less
of
the
off
bitter
finish
as
it
warmed
it
did
smooth
out
some
mouthfeel
is
very
light
with
high
carbonation
to
keep
it
interesting
pretty
drinkable
though
i
wouldnt
want
to
drink
more
than
one
of
these
cheers
toasted
sweetish
malt
flavors
up
front
light
caramel
before
a
slightly
lactotartness
comes
in
citrusy
and
acidic
and
refreshing
nearly
cancels
out
earlier
sweetness
but
toasted
malt
edge
remains
jp
sourness
isnt
as
strong
in
this
brew
compared
to
others
e
g
perseguidor
luciernega
instead
the
tart
wild
funkiness
really
complements
the
malty
caramel
notes
nicely
well
balanced
finish
is
slightly
drier
and
acidic
but
with
residual
toasted
sweetness
another
great
creation
from
what
is
quickly
becoming
my
favorite
brewery
very
well
done
good
deep
amber
garde
color
but
i
expect
a
head
much
better
than
what
i
saw
from
this
beer
good
bubbling
just
terrible
head
retention
good
spicey
toasty
malts
though
made
me
think
of
herbal
biscuits
baking
in
the
oven
the
taste
was
a
little
flat
considering
all
the
visible
carbonation
not
as
good
as
i
had
hoped
the
head
was
nearly
nonexistant
although
the
body
itself
looked
nice
smell
reminded
me
of
some
of
hy
homebrews
actually
and
it
tasted
like
some
of
my
first
batches
too
i
detected
a
bit
of
sweet
toffeelike
malt
but
it
was
overpowered
by
an
astringant
finish
that
hindered
drinkability
the
alcohol
was
wellhidden
but
i
wont
be
buying
another
one
after
its
removal
from
the
750ml
brown
bottle
it
pours
a
hazy
brown
and
upon
reaching
a
level
where
i
could
decant
the
beer
it
forms
an
opaque
brown
with
a
creamy
light
tan
head
that
is
kingly
in
size
as
it
slowly
dissipates
the
residual
lace
forms
a
tight
girdle
upon
the
glass
nose
has
that
nice
oak
barrel
tartness
the
pleasing
malt
sweetness
citrus
like
crispness
and
a
real
portent
of
the
joys
to
come
upon
the
tasting
start
is
semisweet
or
semi
tart
your
choice
nice
grain
presence
top
is
moderate
in
feel
to
the
palate
finish
has
a
perfect
acidity
the
hops
as
they
should
be
understated
but
detectable
quite
dry
desert
bone
dry
to
be

looked

pours
into
the
glass
a
dark
amber
color
with
almost
not
head
just
a
scattering
of
white
bubbles
capping
the
body
sweet
dark
fruits
with
a
big
woody
aroma
tartness
came
out
with
some
earthiness
while
interesting
it
didnt
quite
all
meld
together
well
flavor
started
with
some
oak
notes
mixed
with
sweet
and
tart
fruits
some
earthy
barn
funk
added
some
nice
depth
yeast
notes
before
the
lightly
tart
fruit
finish
tasty
stuff
for
sure
but
some
about
it
seemed
a
bit
out
of
place
that
kept
it
from
being
great
in
my
book
a
bit
under
carbonated
for
the
style
but
smooth
easy
enough
drinking
stuff
that
provided
a
nice
complex
flavor
but
somehow
fell
just
a
bit
short
this
brew
pours
a
clear
brown
color
the
head
is
none
existent
the
aroma
has
a
light
sweetness
to
it
with
a
rather
ample
tartness
the
taste
is
quite
nice
with
a
refreshing
lingering
tartness
the
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
lively
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
fine
brew
that
i
will
most
certainly
have
again
man
you
gotta
love
the
labels

cassoulet
like
me
todayherbal
and
musty
with
a
sour
orange
note
in

finish
much
more
to
this
beer
than
what
i
wrote

just
dont
take
the

to
fade
to

not

by
the
lack

bit
on
the
lighter
side
smooth
and
refreshing
with
a
just
enough
bubbles
keeps
me
coming
back
for
more
id
have
to
say
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
jp
brews
so
far
and
perfect
for
a
50
degree
march
day
thanks
to
marburg
for
the
opportunity
im
planning
on
doing
a
michigan
trip
this
summer
and
cant
wait
to
visit
jp
had
this
one
stashed
away
in
the
cold
cellar
since
october
waited
for
the
ides
of
march
and
to
welcome
the
warmer
weather
as
the
bottle
suggest
the
bottle
by
the
way
very
heavy
22oz
hand
capped
with
a
wicked
illustration
beyond
excellent
presentation
for
sure
pours
a
hazy
orange
and
red
hued
with
lively
carbonation
which
would
persist
strong
but
not
overly
complex
bouquet
i
was
happy
to
find
the
oak
notes
transcend
as
it
warmed
id
consider
this
fairly
heavily
bodied
in
fact
perhaps
too
bold
in
some
respects
strong
hints
of
yeast
with
a
gritty
malt
backbone
an
offputting
sour
mouthfeel
but
with
a
good
lasting
finish
this
is
reminiscent
of
many
sour
belgians
a
la
rodenbach
but
comes
up
very
short
in
comparison
you
can
detect
what
others
have
referred
to
as
grape
notes
through
its
almost
winelike
character
probably
the
effect
of
oak
aging
seems
a
fantastic
brewery
i
hope
to
come
across
again
this
one
could
stand
to
age
a
little
i
find
it
perhaps
too
bold
but
enjoyed
rather
much
like
this
a
most
appropo
beer
for
a
canadian
in
particular
march
indeed
pours
a
murky
red
small
white
head
forms
some
spots
of
lace
head
disappears
to
a
ring
that
sticks
around
smell
is
sour
cherries
vinegar
oak
vanilla
strange
mix
but
neat
taste
is
sourness
up
front
vanillaoak
honeywheat
cherries
and
yeast
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
low
carbonation
a
treat
thanks
drjay
try
it
if
you
find
it
but
only
if
you
cant
find
la
roja
first
this
is
quite
a
rich
beer
and
i
dont
mean
that
in
a
sort
of
thick
palate
sort
of
way
instead
the
fruit
notes
just
give
this
beer
a
certain
richness
that
seem
to
make
it
an
appropriate
after
meal
time
drink
a
solid
though
light
acidity
finishes
this
beer
off
at
the
end
of
a
sip
it
is
tart
like
an
apple
or
plum
perhaps
this
is
really
accentuates
that
feeling
for
me
that
this
would
make
a
good
after
meal
drink
the
acidity
almost
acts
as
a
digestif
for
me
it
keeps
this
light
enough
on
the
palate
to
be
drinkable
but
the
rest
of
the
beer
keeps
this
rich
enough
to
be
a
contemplative
after
meal
treat
hazed
reddish
caramel
colour
with
an
offwhite
head
fine
bubbles
some
lacing
grassy
hop
aroma
with
a
bit
of
sour
cherries
and
some
barnyard
character
maybe
a
wisp
of
caramel
as
well
light
tartness
with
mild
to
moderate
bitterness
and
a
chewy
malt
sweetness
some
yeast
character
and
faint
grain
husk
slightly
tart
finish
with
a
bit
of
spice
and
wood
character
some
slickness
with
creamy
carbonation
and
a
full
body
a
very
good
beer
quite
enjoyable
i
cellared
this
one
for
about
4
months
before
i
cracked
it
not
all
that
long
but
it
was
calling
me
tonight
the
fresh
samples
ive
had
were
much
sweeter
and
less
tart
both
excellent
but
different
either
way
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
of
capt
rons
creations
and
the
beer
that
turned
me
on
to
the
biere
de
garde
style
that
being
said
this
is
definitely
an
outlier
for
the
stylenot
that
it
matters
or
that
the
jovial
yet
menacing
jolly
pumpkin
gives
a
damn
the
oak
aging
makes
itself
far
more
wellknown
in
this
brew
than
its
francophone
brethren
its
also
quite
a
bit
darker
and
perhaps
a
bit
thicker
bodied
but
again
the
pumpkin
could
care
lessand
im
with
him
cloudy
amber
colour
lots
of
lace
sourness
in
nose
wheaty
biere
de
garde
aggressively
carbonated
making
for
full
mouthfeel
well
malted
more
than
jenlain
bitterness
at
end
woodiness
aftertaste
i
had
problems
finishing
with
dr
jay
and
viggo
but
still
nice
a
touch
sour
flavor
with
a
hint
of
alcohol
on
the
swallow
some
tea
flavors
and
sweet
malt
characteristics
a
touch
bitter
from
hops
slightly
grapefruit
in
nature
musty
applely
at
points
dry
this
is
another
ale
from
jolly
pumpkin
that
is
worth
seeking
the
biere
de
mars
really
does
remind
me
of
a
farmhouse
ale
from
the
french
countryside
poured
into
a
rapscallion
glass
formed
a
frothy
1
34
tan
head
over
the
clear
burgundy
brew
head
lasts
and
lasts
leaving
sporadic
large
hunks
of
foams
on
the
glass
sides
aroma
is
spicy
breads
and
yeast
over
a
lightly
fruity
maltiness
taste
is
similar
to
the
nose
but
additionally
light
woody
and
sour
notes
come
out
and
the
close
is
dry
and
slightly
alcoholic
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
smooth
and
drinkability
is
very
nice
as
well
as
per
usual
for
jp
another
hit
here
from
ba
theblackmallard
this
750
ml
bomber
was
quite
exotic
looking
especially
considering
the
fact
that
it
originated
in
michigan
the
reddish
amber
colored
beer
that
resided
in
it
came
out
bubbly
and
foamy
and
looked
quite
at
home
in
a
tulip
the
aroma
was
mild
but
complex
evoking
soured
cherries
plums
freshly
cut
oak
logs
and
oranges
the
taste
was
tart
and
dry
with
loads
of
oak
tannins
a
flash
of
lemon
sourness
mixed
with
some
brown
sugar
was
apparent
as
well
balanced
delicately
between
all
the
flavors
so
none
was
dominant
which
made
it
very
easy
to
drink
despite
the
sawdust
dry
mouthfeel
in
the
words
of
cosmo
kramer
from
seinfeld
wood
is
good
this
is
my
favorite
of
jolly
pumpkins
offerings
a
brew
with
a
complex
flavor
profile
that
is
wellhopped
and
entirely
quaffable
overall
a
good
beer
at
a
cheap
price
from
a
local
place
jolly
pumpkin
has
a
certain
reputation
around
this
area
and
this
is
the
first
thing
that
ive
tried
from
them
while
it
doesnt
wow
me
it
is
certainly
solid
enough
and
i
am
definitely
willing
to
give
some
of
their
other
brews
a
go
a
well
made
brew
from
jolly
pumpkin
poured
out
to
a
hazy
burnt
orange
color
with
a
nice
white
and
orange
hued
head
medium
high
carbonation
islands
of
lace
are
abundant
in
the
glass
aromas
of
yeast
rotted
fruit
mild
roasted
malts
and
grass
taste
was
a
bit
of
a
let
down
compared
to
the
smell
flavors
of
malt
wood
yeast
and
sweetness
went
well
together
but
overall
this
brew
seemed
like
it
was
missing
a
piece
of
the
puzzle
mouthfeel
was
good
and
hearty
without
being
over
bearingly
thick
or
heavy
a
decent
level
of
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
de
garde
but
ive
had
better
worth
a
try
first
of
all
this
beer
is
fun
now
but
will
get
increasingly
interesting
with
age
its
also
not
necessarily
a
biere
de
garde
like
jenlain
or
bavay
so
dont
judge
it
as
such
im
sure
i
will
greatly
edit
my
review
since
this
a
maddeningly
complex
brew
that
is
guaranteed
to
change
and
is
built
to
age
just
a
little
more
spice
from
the
hops
and
this
one
is
fantastic
some
initial
caramel
a
subdued
complexity
that
is
hard
to
put
into
words
the
bannana
hinted
at
in
the
nose
becomes
quite
muted
some
nice
plum
sort
of
flavours
float
around
through
the
middle
and
lead
to
a
bone
dry
finish
that
lingers
for
a
moment
and
then
invites
another
sip
some
brett
character
subtly
working
its
way
into
the
profile
medium
bodied
gentle
carbonation
this
beer
is
just
crying
out
to
be
enjoyed
with
a
meal
shows
some
interesting
promise
for
aging
a
distinctly
american
interpretation
of
biere
de
garde
that
some
will
treasure
i
think
you
can
count
me
as
a
fan
i
can
see
this
one
being
a
solid
session
beer
when
paired
with
the
right
grub

this
is
a

beverage
i
enjoy
it
a
great
deal
though
i
hesitate
to
sing
its
praises
too
loudly
until
ive
tried
it
again
in
six
months
when
i
think
it
will
be
truly
amazing
if
beers
in
this
spirit
comprise
the
future
of
american
brewing
im
looking
forward
to
being
around
for
the
ride
o
spicy
beer
with
a
nice
bit
of
sour
drinkin
this
with
my
buddy
max
at
jester
king
brewery
poured
into
my
teku
glass
o
intense
without
sacrificing
complexity
to
do
so
this
is
an
interestingly
sour
biere
de
garde
would
repeat
based
on
a
2
5
yearold
bottle
i
was
excited
for
this
beer
and
waited
until
it
was
fall
to
try
it
unfortunately
it
just
didnt
deliver
of
all
the
different
jp
beers
i
have
reviewed
about
12
of
them
this
to
my
memory
seems
the
most
watery
and
the
least
flavorful
the
flavor
itself
is
not
bad
but
the
beer
and
the
flavor
just
seem
so
watered
down
what
happened
here

would
buy

excellent
beer
from

surprising
gem
bought
it
because
it
was
marked
down
from
16
to
8
and
i
knew
nothing
about
the
beer
enjoyed
it
very
much
excellent
and
interesting
beer
this
is
one
of
the
first
beire
de

that
actually
moved
me
had
some
barnyard
funk
going
on
in
the
smell
and
tastebut
finishes
dry
instead
of
tart
or
sour
recommend
this
one
would
definitely
revisit
as
well
overall
not
as
complex
and
oak
funk
driven
as
other
jp
beers
ive
had
but
that
takes
nothing
away
from
this
warming
fall
brew
love
the
chestnut
additions
really
add
a
unique
touch
extremely
well
executed
scheme
which
is
unsurprisingly
considering
the
things
this
brewery
is
doing

glad
i
got
this
on

awesome
brew
with
awesome
flavors
o
good
sour
dry
and
mellow
would
buy
again
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
good
beer
and
i
thought
it
was
a
good
example
of
the
style
and
a
good
example
of
a
jolly
pumpkin
beer
with
the
yeast
and
oak
showing
up
nicely
along
with
some
nice
supporting
flavors
this
beer
had
good
drinkability
it
was
smooth
pretty
crisp
medium
tart
not
too
acidic
not
too
filling
and
the
taste
did
a
nice
job
at
holding
my
attention
i
think
half
the
bottle
is
the
right
amount
for
me
but
im
pretty
sure
i
wouldnt
have
a
problem
drinking
a
whole
bottle
and
i
think
it
would
make
for
a
nice
beer
to
enjoy
on
a
warmer
fall
date
what
i
like
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
balance
and
complexity
that
showed
up
n
the
flavor
it
took
me
a
few
sip
to
get
all
the
different
flavors
that
were
showing
up
and
they
blended
well
together
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
pretty
much
nothing
but
i
do
wish
the
chestnut
was
noticeable
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
when
its
released
in
the
fall
and
i
recommend
it
to
anyone
who
likes
biere
de
gardes
or
jolly
pumpkin
beers
its
a
little
pricey
but
its
worth
a
try
all
in
all
i
was
happy
with
this
beer
ive
had
it
a
few
times
before
and
my
score
did
not
change
at
all
its
always
been
a
solid
4
in
my
book
and
i
always
look
forward
to
it
in
the
fall
this
isnt
my
favorite
jolly
pumpkin
beer
or
biere
de
garde
but
its
still
a
good
beer
nonetheless
and
i
enjoyed
drinking
it
good
job
guys
keep
up
the
hard
work

good
blend
aroma
and
body
this
beer
was
really
interesting
in
the
light
on
the
bar
this
beer
had
a
golden
almost
orange
color
to
it
it
had
a
fruity
cherryplum
aroma
mixed
with
the
smell
of
corona
not
from
the
bar
the
smell
was
coming
from
the
jolly
pumpkin
beer
the
mouth
feel
of
the
beer
was
interesting
it
started
with
some
body
to
it
that
fades
away
on
the
tip
of
your
tongue
to
a
dry
almost
acidic
like
finish
the
beer
starts
with
that
almost
brett
spicy
funky
flavor
and
then
transitions
to
a
light
tart
cherry
flavor
on
the
finish
over
all
i
enjoyed
this
beer
its
not
something
that
i
want
to
session
but
it
is
a
beer
i
would
like
to
drink
every
now
and
then
o
an
amazing
and
refreshing
brew
by
jp
i
love
the
fact
that
these
are
refreshing
and
interesting
beers
that
you
can
drink
all
day
everyday
if
only
my
wallet
would
allow
that
regardless
a
must
try
by
jp
and
definitely
getting
hard
to
pick
a
favorite
i
remember
a
time
not
all
that
long
ago
this
style
would
have
rubbed
me
the
wrong
way
im
glad
it
has
grown
on
me
because
this
is
a
fantastic
brew
i
would
have
missed
out
on
otherwise
plenty
of
sourness
here
to
please
fans
of
warhead
and
sweettart
candies
but
complex
enough
to
earn
a
nod
from
the
most
stubborn
beer
snob
well
worth
your
time
and
money
i
love
jolly
pumpkin
we
were
spoiled
to
have
their
stuff
on
the
shelf
before
the
sourwild
ale
craze
really
hit
and
now
with
so
many
sub
standard
offerings
on
the
shelves
its
nice
to
revisit
jolly
pumpkin
and
taste
how
its
all
supposed
to
be
again
delicious
stuff
this
one
done
with
chestnuts
light
brassy
color
minimally
cloudy
with
a
short
lived
fizzy
tan
head
the
nose
on
this
is
a
true
wild
ale
bretty
and
a
little
sour
with
notes
of
roasted
nuts
and
toffee
like
a
brittle
without
the
sweetness
the
flavor
starts
off
a
little
sour
and
a
lot
funky
bubbly
and
tart
but
half
way
through
it
gives
way
to
an
earthy
nuttiness
that
must
be
from
both
the
malts
and
the
chestnuts
its
more
like
almonds
or
cashews
in
terms
of
flavor
but
its
pronounced
and
interesting
along
with
the
wild
yeasts
that
creep
back
in
towards
the
finish
in
a
fizzy
whirl
of
interesting
autumnal
flavors
i
have
always
appreciated
their
special
releases
cool
new
takes
on
seasonal
ales
and
this
one
too
is
excellent
i
am
going
to
continue
to
redrink
their
lineup
i
forgot
how
much
i
like
all
this
stuff
o
this
has
two
facets
of
a
good
beer
nice
and
sour
to
begin
nice
woody
end

this
is
an
above
average
beer
that
is
much
too
herbal

medicinal
forward
for
my
liking
o
not
a
beer
i
could
drink
over
and
over
but
definitely
one
to
sip
slowly
and
enjoy
on
a
fall
night
a
unique
taste
overall
one
of
the
weirdest
beers
ive
ever
tried
much
unlike
anything
else
definitely
worth
a
grab
if
you
see
it
just
to
see
what
you
get
out
of
it
recommended
super
super
drinkable
even
though
its
only
about
6
abv
to
begin
with
theres
no
touch
of
alcohol
in
the
taste
great
balance
of
tart
and
funk
this
beer
is
as
easy
drinking
as
it
can
get
for
the
style
you
could
easily
crush
a
750
ml
bottle
of
this
on
your
own
and
probably
move
on
to
another
one
right
after
jolly
pumpkin
continues
to
do
what
they
do
best
overall
enjoyable
just
as
i
would
expect
know
some
think
they
all
taste
the
same
jp
brews
that
is
but
i
enjoy
the
funky
flavors
have
yet
to
have
a
bad
beer
from
these
guys
wish
i
could
get
this
in
town
of
well
always
something
to
look
for
when
out
of
town
taste
my
first
of
the
style
and
interesting
cinnamon
fruit
sour
tart
sweet
its
all
over
the
place
and
should
be
a
mess
but
it
isnt
ive
not
had
a
beer
like
this
before
and
im
glad
to
finally
have
gotten
the
chance
to
try
some
jolly
pumpkin
its
a
good
beer
that
id
buy
in
12oz
bottles
but
i
wouldnt
ever
see
myself
buying
a
750ml
d
great
balanced
and
complex
version
of
the
syle
o
this
is
one
of
the
better
jolly
pumpkin
beers
that
i
have
tried
i
like
the
tartness
of
it
it
is
quite
enjoyable
o
i
greatly
enjoy
sours
and
most
of
jolly
pumpkin
beers
for
that
matter
this
is
very
near
the
top
of
the
jp
list
i
will
grab
several
of
these
each
season
i
certainly
recommend
this
beer
if
you
enjoy
sours
especially
ones
that
are
not
on
the
sweeter
side

i
grabbed
it
up
when
i
heard
that
there
was
gonna
be
no
more
jp
in
mn
this
is
a
nice
brew
and
i
hope
to
pick
up
a
little
more
before
shes
totally
gone
beer

quite
dry
with
little

stickiness
remaining
on

o
an
overall
good
beer
with
a
great

with
slight
sweet

o
i
like
this
beer
i
dont
know
if
i
could
drink
this
all
the
time
but
its
good
nice
beer
unique

and
changes
in
flavor
the
sour
might
put
some
people
off

i
liked

mahalo
indeed
it
is
a
bit
of
autumn
sunshine
it
is
best
to
leave
the
sediment
in
the
bottle
overall
another
solid
jolly
pumpkin
brew
i
always
look
forward
to
see
what
we
get
next
here
in
ok
and
even
though
it
might
be
old
not
sure
when
batches
go
out
for
retail
its
always
good
to
see
something
seasonal
thats
a
touch
different
single
finger
head
on
a
hazy
amber
and
orange
body
lots
of
fruits
nuts
spice
and
molasses
in
the

flavor
follows
that
of
a
mild
sour
or
wild
ale
with
some
dark
fruits
spices
include
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
medium
body
a
little
chewy
with
moderate
carbonation

got

retained
decently
typical

woody
notes
of
light

and
mulled

a
touch
of
biscuity
malts
and
caramel
in
the
taste
are
quickly
overcome
by
a
sweeping
but
not
jarring
sourness
lemon
juice
and
apple
pie
notes
of
indistinct
spice
the
label
listed
chestnuts
as
an
ingredient
but
im
not
sure
i
picked
up
any
of
that
in
the
taste
if
it
was
there
it
was
low
in
the
mix
so
to
speak
medium

prickly
carbonation
as
my
wife
doesnt
care
much
for
sour
beers
i
was
easily
able
to
conquer
this
whole
bottle
by
myself
exactly
what
i
wanted
cheers
overall
this
was
another
solid
brew
from
jolly
pumpkin
would
be
very
curious
to
try
a
fresh
bottle
but
i
would
still
recommend
to
anyone
willing
to
pay
the
price
for
a
bottle
overall
between

and
people
when
i
catch
my
reflection
stay
attractive
my
friends
owell
this
is
just
delectable
theres
something
about
it
i
could
drink
this
all
night
long
its
not
too
complex
or
bold
but
wow
it
has
one
of
those
mild
flavor
that
make
it
nice
for
the
long
run
pours
a
slightly
hazy
dark
orange
topped
by
a
tight
thin
white
foam
delightful
mix
of
aromas
include
cooked
cinnamon
apples
sweet
dough
and
hints
of
tart
citrus
fruit
flavor
is
a
meld
of
doughy
malt
but
a
sour
component
is
also
quite
prevalent
in
the
middle
finishes
with
a
nod
towards
sweet
baked
cookies
and
a
touch
of
caramel
a
bit
funky
too
barnyard
and
wet

medium
light
in
body
moderate
to
moderate
high
level
of
carbonation
jolly
pumpkin
is
one
brewery
ive
not
sampled
many
beers
from
but
i
like
what
theyve
put
together
here
o
as
a
fan
of
jolly
pumpkin
this
was
yet
another
treat
the
fall
theme
really
carries
out
throw
the
earthy
and
spicy
flavors
sour
yet
smooth
and
refined
the
light
feel
and
the
warming
sensation
is
well
executed
nice
example
of
the
style
this
really
does
remind
me
of
fall
light
funk
with
good
tartness
not
sure
i
could
pick
out
the
chestnuts
delicate
flavors
and
an
inviting
nose
make
this
a
joy
to
drink
o
really
nicely
done
biere
de
garde
is
one
of
my
favorite
styles
and
jolly
pumpkin
has
done
it
justice
with
this
concoction
seek
this
brew
out
if
you
are
new
to
sours
or
if
you
have
found
jolly
pumpkins
other
work
to
be
too
much
for
you
o
solid
beer
from
jolly
pumpkin
but
not
up
with
my
favorites
still
i
would
have
this
again
overall
very
nice

pretty
good

cloves
horseblanket
some

and
a
little

are
all
present
they
mesh
rather
wonderfully
with
the
chestnuts
delicately
toasted
but
arguably
a
little
overdone
the
spices
play
a
secondary
but
important
role
here
complementing
the
brett

and
the
chestnuts
the
combination
also
does
bring
to

a

actual

this

i

more

beyond

this
is

the

is
of
sweet
notes
and
malt
up

before
you
get
a
spiciness
and
sour
in

the
taste
follows
suit
with
a

a
hint

a

taste
followed
by
a

the

i
think
this

is
terrific
i
do
plan
on
purchasing
this
again
anyone
that
loves
sours
ales
and
seasonal
fall
beers
will
love
this
one
overall
impression
another
great
one
from
jolly

i
appreciate
every
beer
they
brew
because
of
the
sour
notes
available
im
glad
i
was
able
to
find
another
bottle
of
this
because
i
traded
a
bottle
off
to
my
cousin
would
definitely
recommend
if
you
enjoy
a
saisonbiere
de
garde
style
but
then
also
appreciate
a
sour
character
o
this
is
really
good
stuff
the
acid
is
understated
but
maintains
itself
and
is
an
integral
part
of
the
experience
real
good
flavours
ive
been
wanting
to
try
this
for
a
while
weird
that
it
ended
up
being
winter
but
so
be
it
a
fantastic
beer
from
jolly
pumpkin
the
price
is
tough
but
this
is
well
done
overall
a
real
pleasant
beer
the
type
of
lightbodied
beer
id
like
to
enjoy
during
the
holidays
overall
a
nice
beer
with
a
nice
bright
tartness
and
a
strong
chestnut
flavor
definitely
unique
but
not
the
strongest
offering
fom
jolly
pumpkin
ive
had
some
more
time
in
the

might
brighten
this
up
and
increase
the
funk

might

this
one
wont
disappoint

overall
this
isnt
really
that
exciting
to
me
but
its
actually
quite
nice
drinking
and
very
easy
to
enjoy
the
feel
of
this
beer
seems
to
be
the
thing
i
enjoy
the
most
seems
like
a
good
beer
for
fall
too
if
there
is
such
a
thing
as
a
generic
sour
this
would
be
it
nothing
wrong
with
this
and
nothing
bad
at
all
just
nothing
distinguishes
this
from
any
other
jp
beer
o
interesting
lots
of
potential
in
the
nose
but
the
taste
is
little
weak
and
mild
this
beer
would
go
perfect
on
slightly
warm
fall
day
occurs
often
in
las
vegas
a
very
interesting
fall
take
on
the
style
drinkable
but
not
in
anything
more
than
a
small
amount
id
tire
of
it
quickly
o
this
brew
could
stand
to
be
much
more
sour
another
great
quality
beer
brewed
with
love
from
jp
nice
work
ron
buy
it
if
you
can
find
it
cheers
mahalo
smell
is
definately
some
brett
really
sweet
in
general
from
the
malts
which
give
it
a
nice
caremal
smell
taste
is
a
nice
brett
with
some
sweetness
i
have
a
hard
time
describing
really

caremal
or
some
sort
of
belgian
candy
sugar
just
a
nice
taste
not
too
much
brett
like
alot
of
jolly
punpkin
beers
this
is
just
perfect
since
they
really
arent
very
sour
more
sour
would
be
nice
but
not
gonna
complain
as
this
is
the
best
jolly
pumpkin
i
have
tasted
in
a
while
other
favorites
are
the
pumpkin
and
noel
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
nice
overall
a
nice
beer
but
i
really
dont
buy
jolly
pumpkin
much
anymore
because
there
are
better
out
there
interesting
beer
from
jolly
pumpkin
dont
really
get
any
of
the
roasted
chestnuts
jp
beers
have
a
very
distinct
feel
to
them
and
this
one
was
no
different
id
be
proud
to
serve
this
beer
to
people
and
proud
to
wear
a
badge
that
proclaims
i
drink
it
its
a
beer
that
if
it
came
across
as
polarising
i
would
defend
to
the
hilt
in
short
i
feel
patriotic
jingoistic
even
about
this
wonderfully
complex
refreshing
drop
yes
even
though
per
bottle
the
price
was
higher
than
i
usually
shell
out
of
beers
this
brew
will
be
on
my
must
have
list
surprise
looking
for
leftover
king
henry
and
found
this
a
bitter
sweet
victory
poured
into
a
tulip
a
pale
golden
straw
slightly
opaque
less
carbonation
then
anticipated
not
the
most
attractive
beer
plenty
of
must
basement
and
phenols
funk
but
there
is
also
a
nuanced
spice
note
and
a
malty
backbone
with
a
clear
toasty
presence
while
there
is
funk
cherry
pie
and
oak
there
are
also
more
subtle
flavors
or
spice
sweetness
and
yes
chestnuthazelnutgeneral
nuttyness
a
very
complex
beer
indeed
medium
bodied
over
the
palate
this
could
be
one
of
jps
better
showings
o
this
is
a
really
tasty
brew
i
really
have
been
enjoying
everything
jolly
pumpkin
does
and
thats
jolly
pumpkin
all
over
overall
a
very
good
sour
ale
the
funk
and
vinegar
combine
with
a
slight
sweetness
and
the
wood
flavors
for
a
nice
balance
the
spices
come
through
very
slightly
but
they
are
there
and
they
add
an
interesting
element
to
the
flavor
d
one
is
enough
light
to
medium
mouthfeel
that
has
nearly
no
notice
of
alcohol
very
drinkable
and
very
enjoyable
highly
recommended
the
beer
is
sunburst
hued
rusty
orange
the
head
is
over
an
inch
thick
and
hangs
out
for
several
minutes
leaving
a
thick
sheet
of
lacing
in
its
wake
the
aroma
brings
the
anticipated
jolly
pumpkin
funk
with
spice
malt
citrus
fruits
oak
floral
notes
really
wonderful
aroma
the
flavor
is
complex
intriguing
and
delicious
super
smooth
with
a
yeasty
funkiness
about
it
lingering
notes
of
citrus
no
sign
of
alcohol
i
had
no
problem
whatsoever
draining
my
half
of
the
bomber
recommended
pours
a
beautiful
amber
color
w
a
perfect
off
white
two
finger
head
fairly
cloudy
w
great
carbonation
and
great
lacing
nose
is
that
of
wild
yeast
malt
nutmeg
floral
spices
fairly
smooth
for
what
i
was
expecting
very
balanced
as
well
taste
is
fairly
similar
to
the
nose
w
the
floral
notes
and
oak
really
coming
out
nice
oak
aftertaste
feel
is
tart
mixed
w
malt
and
funk
very
nice
especially
for
the
style
smooth
vs
tart
done
very
well
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
great
for
the
style
and
close
to
being

5s
in
several
areas

750ml
bottle
oct
2008
batch
having
had
this
beer
several
times
i
can
say
it
needs
at
least
three
months
after
its
released
to
really
come
into
its
own
it
was
released
way
too
young
imo
moving
on
it
pours
a
really
beautiful
glowing
reddish
honey
with
a
pillowy
beige
head
awesome
gorgeous
vintage
jolly
pumpkin
nose
softlyintegrated
brett
sour
tropical
fruits
and
of
course
oak
the
flavor
is
vinous
subtle
and
refreshing
there
is
not
that
burst
of
flavor
you
might
expect
though
this
could
be
a
phenomenal
beer
if
the
flavors
were
more
pronounced
i
still
really
like
it
o
good
i
enjoyed
this
worth
the
15
mostly
due
to
the
price
i
probably
wont
buy
it
again
unless
i
want
to
indoctrinate
someone
into
the
realm
of
sour
beer
id
still
probably
buy
their
calablaza
blanca
regardless
i
love
jolly
pumpkin
and
i
am
glad
that
they
brew
these
marvelous
exciting
beers
overall
a
very
nice
wood
aged
sour
im
not
picking
up
on
the
bdg
aspects
id
put
this
in
the
american
wild
category
as
a
biere
de
garde
it
is
not
very
representative
of
the
style
the
cpj
bottle
purchased
about
a
month
ago
in
michigan
pours
an
amberorange
colour
with
very
thick
white
head
nice
lacing
around
the
glass
smells
quite
spicy
nutmeg
and
coriander
i
think
can
tell
it
is
going
to
be
tart
from
the
smell
some
apple
as
well
flavour
is
almost
sour
still
has
some
sweetness
though
really
big
carbonation
level
another
nice
beer
from
this
brewery

bottled

a
half
month
past
my
birthday
looks
brilliant
with
a
nice
copper
pale
malted
hue
with
a
bright
off
white
head
forms
a
fine
even
band
of
lacing
that
continues
with
each
sip
nose
has
hints
of
cider
coriander
and
roasted
chestnuts
what
a
wild
ale
sour
ale
to
the
max
tastes
like
a
layer
of
lactic
yogurt
and
tree
bark
sour
and
bit
all
the
same
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
higher
carbonation
not
much
going
on
but
bone
dry
finish
between
the
lactic
bittrness
and
tree
bark
mainly
oak
ale
aging
drinkability
overall
is
decent
but
overall
it
was
a
bit
rough
with
barkoak
flavor
not
much
other
than
that
overall
a
solid
sour
beer
a
nice
mix
of
sour
and
spices
mouthfeel
drinkability
light
bodied
crisp
and
refreshing
sort
of
a
cooling
arctic
chill
to
the
entire
taste
that
reminds
me
of
sucking
on
a
mint
a
pleasant
sourness
upfront
that
transitions
to
sweet
cinnamon
apple
delicious
a
nice
niche
drink
and
overall
very
drinkable
emily
says
she
could
drink
alot
of
this
wonderfully
flavorful
earthy
and
zesty
awesome
beer
another
fantastic
jolly
pumpkin
beer
d
even
for
a
jolly
pumpkin
beer
this
is
pretty
interesting
i
liked
it
quite
a
bit
but
its
definitely
different
from
most
of
their
beers
d
not
the
most
drinkable
jolly
pumpkin
i
have
had
but
still
good
nonetheless
each
time
i
think
that
jolly
pumpkin
may
finally
let
me
down
i
am
proved
wrong
over
and
over
again
d
darn
good
stuff
i
wouldnt
have
any
problem
pairing
this
stuff
with
a
hearty
holiday
dinner
d
great
d
a
lot
of
promise
but
the
mouthfeel
kills
it
a
bit
for
me
still
very
tasty
and
worth
trying
drinkability
extremely
quaffable
slowly
enjoying
this
beer
because
i
know
they
are
relatively
hard
to
come
by
now
until
a
new
batch
is
brewed
extremely
thankful
i
was
able
to
try
this
especially
on
such
a
utterly
perfect
night
looks
great
but
for
the
most
part
its
just
above
average
2007
vintage
thanks
to
nightbrew
for
bringing
this
one
over
deep
amber
color
the
nose
is
similar
in
some
ways
to
a
flemish
sour
apple
skin
and
funk
for
sure
the
taste
is
a
bit
of
a
let
down
after
the
pungent
nose
its
a
little
too
subdued
funky
slightly
tart
apple
maybe
a
hint
of
nuttiness
amidst
all
the
funk
the
body
is
soft
with
a
bit
of
sparkle
overall
a
pretty
friggin
tangy
beer
sour
fans
unite
tart
slightly
puckering
medium
body
which
is
on
the
fuller
end
of
the
spectrum
the
oak
flavor
is
prominent
with
hints
of
vanilla
and
lacto
funk
nutty
with
hints
of
spicy
cinnamon
brown
sugar
and
vanilla
nice
amount
of
soft
carbonation
with
some
sweet
caramel
malt
autumnal
spiciness
and
more
funk
and
oak
character
theres
a
very
harmonious
balance
of
sweet
and
tart
notes
with
a
dry
finish
very
good
d
the
tartness
detracts
a
bit
from
the
drinkability
a
bit
but
overall
this
is
a
delicious
beer
interested
to
know
what
this
would
have
been
like
fresh
served
in
a
dimple
glass
deep
ruby
color
with
a
large
pillowish
head
beautiful
beer
earthiness
and
spices
dominate
the
nose
but
you
can
definitely
tell
it
a
jp
beer
i
also
get
some
raisons
and
tart
plums
actually
a
lot
of
plum
taste
is
a
little
funkier
than
i
expected
with
some
oak
thrown
in
too
this
beer
actually
had
a
nice
balance
and
would
pair
well
with
many
foods
i
get
a
little
oxidation
in
the
aftertaste
but
i
like
this
one
this
is
probably
the
10th
or
so
beer
ive
had
from
jolly
pumpkin
and
they
are
all
solid
d
fuego
del
otono
is
a
really
unique
complex
beer
that
artfully
combines
fruity
tart
oaky
sour
and
sweet
elements
i
really
enjoyed
the
peachy
finish
of
this
beer
very
nice
d
decent

a
fan
of

not
that
strong

but
not
really
all
that
impressive
taste
is
very
yeasty
sour
dark
fruit
im
not
getting
a
lot
of
other
autumn
harvest
crops
bitter
sour
finish
is
a
bit
sharp
and
body
is
on
the
thin
side
head
reduced
to
a
white
array
of
stagnant
bubbles
in
a
thin
creamy
froth
solid
ring
good
sheet

this
would
likely
go
well
with
a
rich
thanksgiving
dinner
with
sharp
and
sour
notes
to
cut
through
the
grease
as
far
as
chestnuts
go
i
didnt
get
a
lot
coming
through
drinkability
this
is
a
good
beer
to
relax
with
on
a
cool
autumnal
evening
i
think
there
may
be
other
beers
in
the
jolly
pumpkin
universe
that
i
like
a
bit
more
than
this
one
i
dont
rate
it
as
high
as
many
others
here
but
it
is
a
unique
and
tasty
beer
nonetheless
even
though
i
was
displeased
with
the
mouthfeel
and
taste
at
first
as
it
warms
or
as
i
grow
accustomed
to
the
beer
it
becomes
pretty
enjoyable
im
not
particularly
into
sour
beers
but
this
one
is
pretty
balanced
note
becomes
more
pleasant
as
it
warms
tart
flavors
mellow
malt
peaks
through
ive
had
fuego
del
otoño
on
many
occasions
now
and
have
each
and
every
time
enjoyed
it
in
fact
i
make
sure
to
hide
a
bottle
away
for
every
thanksgiving
although
it
may
not
be
my
favourite
jolly
pumpkin
offering
it
is
like
all
the
brewerys
beers
truly
something
to
sip
contemplate
and
enjoy
all
the
better
with
friends
or
family
i
might
add
the
aggressive
oakaged
flavoring
seems
to
render
most
of
their
brews
extremely
similar
nothing
too
special
in
my
opinon
about
this
one
despite
obvious
craftmanship
in
the
making
noticeable
oak
aroma
flavor
and
finish
paired
with
hints
of
chestnuts
bread
butter
caramel
and
cinnamon
interesting
beer
to
say
the
least
despite
not
particularly
tickling
my
fancy
this
was
the
first
beer
from
jolly
pumpkin
ive
tried
to
say
that
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
would
be
an
understatement
from
the
moment
i
poured
it
out
i
was
taken
by
its
appearance
and
smell
this
was
not
what
i
expected
from
a
beer
brewed
with
chestnut
and
spice
the
smell
was
surprisingly
refreshing
while
remaining
spicy
it
brought
to
mind
not
autumn
as
much
as
an
image
of
an
exotic
place
involved
in
the
spice
trade
yet
teaming
with
verdant
flora
the
appearance
a
nice
moderate
color
that
brought
to
mind
a
well
milled
table
neither
too
light
nor
too
dark
a
that
bordered
on
golden
and
orange
but
was
brownish
and
pleasing
when
poured
into
a
wine
glass
it
produced
a
thick
but
tight
head
that
again
was
unexpected
in
relation
to
the
color
the
taste
although
having
some
incredibly
interesting
qualities
was
firmly
routed
in
what
i
would
expect
from
the
chestnuts
and
spice
although
the
beer
did
not
have
any
immediate
standouts
it
felt
both
earthy
and
sour
at
the
same
time
it
brought
to
mind
the
qualities
common
to
both
cigars
and
whiskey
as
well
as
the
zest
of
lemons
and
sour
apples
what
i
most
noted
was
an
interplay
between
the
sour
apple
bubbly
nature
and
a
woody
cinnamon
that
interplay
in
a
way
that
is
distinctively
autumnal
the
moutfeel
was
pleasant
and
bubbly
but
not
exactly
my
cup
of
tea
not
bad
but
not
worth
writing
home
about
the
drinkability
is
obviously
knocked
down
by
some
of
the
characteristics
that
make
the
style
i
was
surprised
though
to
find
myself
finishing
the
bottle
over
the
course
of
about
2
5
hours
although
i
couldnt
regularly
see
myself
downing
a
bottle
a
glass
or
two
could
not
be
refused
overall
i
will
say
that
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
had
in
a
long
time
it
is
in
a
style
that
i
dont
usually
go
for
as
easily
but
after
hearing
good
things
about
jolly
pumpkin
i
took
a
chance
on
a
beer
that
i
truly
enjoy
and
embrace
i
will
definitely
be
buying
another
bottle
or
two
this
season
and
i
would
love
if
i
had
the
ability
to
cellar
a
few
the
fuego
del
otono
has
inspired
me
to
pursue
all
of
jolly
pumpkins
offerings
dont
think
id
drop
another
16
on
one
of
these
but
if
you
like
the
biere
de
garde
style
andor
you
dig
saisons
you
should
be
happy
with
this
one
750

1
34
inch

that
left

in
here
aroma
consists
of
caramel
pumpkin
spice
clove
various
herbs
lemon
scents
tart
earthiness
roasted
nuts
and
grapefruit
taste
is
full
of
tart
in
the
beginning
fades
into
tarty
citrus
in
the
middle
finishes
dry
with
earthiness
and
a
few
different
kind
of
nutty
flavors
lingering
in
the
aftertaste
some
berries
and
oak
come
out
by
the
end
but
still
tarty
with
oranges
and
lemons
nice
mix
of
malt
and
spices
to
mold
with
that
leading
to
nice
complexity
dry
spicy
tart
and
malty
mouthfeel
medium
bodied
tons
of
carbonation
taste
lingers
well
could
have
drank
this
whole
bottle
refreshing
and
light
on
the
stomach
a
lot
going
on
in
the
flavor
profile
but
still
keeps
a
smooth
fell
nice
surprise
from
jolly
pumpkin
would
love
to
see
a
grand
reserve
version
of
this
nice
tart
welcome
with
a
funky
finish
would
like
to
drink
again

what
foods
id
pair
it
with
but
its
strong
enough
to
hold
up
to
anything
i
love
it
as
a
sipper
and
at
this
low
of
an
abv
this
250ml
will
be
gone
in
no
time
at
all
love
it
pours
a
slightly
murky
amber
rich
but
a
bit
cloudy
smell
is
a
touch
of
tart
brett
with
a
bit
of
spicing
that
hits
the
nose
just
right
almost
like
an
exotic
christmas
drink
or
cookie
like
theres
some
caramel
malt
in
there
too
great
malt
base
spicing
is
light
and
mixes
with
the
brett
just
perfectly
almost
a
bit
nutty
great
body
and
heft
a
perfect
sipper
for
an
evening
very
drinkable

flavor

pretty
similar
to
any

its
still
quite
tasty
poured
a
thin
copper
brown
with
a
twofinger

that
died
slowly
and
left
some

down

a
sweet
and
spicy
smell
of
caramelized
malts
pepper
clove
corriander
i
think
and
stuff
like
cinnamonnutmeg
pumpkin
beer
material
as
well
as
some
heavy
fruits
light
hop
presence
a
mix
of
tart
fruits
and
sweetspicy
malts
for
a
wellbalanced
and
great
tasting
beer
mediumbody
that
is
slightly
chewey
that
goes
down
easy
and
is
full
of
spicesmalts
that
percolate
on
the
tongue
and
this
is
evened
out
w
tart
fruits
like
applegrape
and
something
akin
to
red
wine
oakiness
a
definite
sipper
as
it
smooths
as
it
warms
and
when
the
tongue
gets
used
to
the
intial
tartness
it
is
even
more
pleasant
outstanding
beer
as
i
have
come
to
expect
from
jolly
pumpkin
and
quite
unique
d
wow
an
absolutely
stunning
beer
despite
the
fact
that
im
drinking
this
in
april
this
will
be
my
session
beer
of
choice
come
autumn
i
would
pair
this
brew
with
an
aged
comté
a
hearty
beef
and
root
vegetable
stew
or
drink
it
on
its
own
i
can
only
imagine
how
well
this
brew
would
age
in
the
cellar
the
acidity
level
and
lactic
qualities
are
similar
to
most
of
the
other
jp
brews
it
seems
that
ron
has
found
a
groove
in
that
aspect
im
not
picking
up
any
chestnuts
though
so
im
a
bit
dissapointed
highly
drinkable
and
the
spicing
is
subtle
and
theres
plenty
of
brett
to
keep
things
interesting
d
very
nice
yeasty
nature
never
overbearing
providing
just
the
right
amount
of
funk
with
a
light
assortment
of
spiciness
and
citrusy
tartness
that
was
very
smooth
going
down
another
astonishingly
unique
blend
of
flavors
from
jolly
pumpkin
co
as
a
kid
i
would
never
have
dreamed
of
tasting
a
liquid
with
such
flavors
at
this
age
i
know
better
you
may
hate
this
beer
but
you
need
to
try
it
i
personally
liked
it
and
will
buy
it
again
now
hopslam
and
to
bed
325
i
can
do
this
solid
although
on
the
tart
side
for
a
biere
de
garde
but
thats
jolly
pumpkin
for
you
always
excited
to
try
stuff
from
jolly
pumpkin
i
bought
this
one
at
julios
today
cool
looking
label
as
well
poured
a
lively
dark
orange
with
a
half
finger
of
white
heading
that
has
a
lot
of
lasting
power
good
aroma
of
funky
wild
yeast
some
noticeable
sour
notes
musty
cellar
smell
and
some
interesting
spice
taste
starts
off
sort
of
citrusy
maybe
some
lemon
then
fades
in
to
a
more
powerful
medicinal
taste
definitely
has
a
strong
layer
of
leather
like
brett
in
the
flavor
body
of
this
beer
is
on
the
medium
side
which
is
not
a
bad
thing
drinkability
lacks
a
little
bit
for
me
only
because
of
the
intense
funk
that
is
present
not
the
best
from
jolly
pumpkin
but
pretty
good
either
way
worthy
of
a
purchase
cheers
the
complexity
in
this
is
a
lot
of
fun
it
starts
out
slowly
but
burns
strong
through
the
night
like
a
good
fire
for
all
its
spice
and
general
weirdness
its
very
clean
wellcrafted
d
a
nice
and
complex
beer
although
one
bottle
is
enough
for
one
evening
drinkability
interesting
complex
beer
that
leaves
you
wanting
more
whent
he
glass
is
emptied
worth
picking
one
of
these
up
for
yourself
suffice
it
to
say
this
beer
is
outstanding
also
i
totally
get
the
autumn
flavor
aspect
to
this
beer
there
is
some
lovely
underlying
spice
in
this
beer
and
the
interplay
of
light
sour
funk
with
the
malt
and
hops
is
impressive
i
could
absolutely
see
serving
this
fine
beer
with
a
thanksgiving
turkey
dinner
and
think
it
would
pair
well
with
turkey
meat
dressing
potatoes
and
even
pumpkin
pie
this
is
very
good
stuff
i
poured
this
into
my
tulip
approx
50
degrees
it
is
a
lovely
goldencopper
color
and
had
a
silky
head
that
dissipated
quickly
the
aroma
is
filled
with
sour
cherry
but
with
a
hint
of
the
malty
sweetness
tangy
and
tart
it
doesnt
evolve
into
a
myriad
of
flavors
as
do
many
sour
beers
i
have
had
there
is
a
nice
caramel
malt
presence
that
provides
a
comforting
balance
it
is
lightly
carbonated
and
has
a
pleasant
astringency
from
the
barrel
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
the
sourness
i
am
really
growing
to
like
jolly
pumpkin
as
a
brewery
another
solid
beer
from
jolly
pumpkin
the
body
is
a
bit
thin
but
just
right
carbonation
very
nice
drinker
for
the
colder
days
i
may
go
back
to
this
one
but
not
my
favorite
of
jolly
pumpkin
another
fine
ale
from
jolly
pumpkin
pours
an
autumn
brown
and
has
a
silky
beige
head
quite
a
beautifull
beer
the
nose
has
candy
malts
followed
by
tart
citrus
fruits
and
oaky
funk
the
taste
has
sweet
malts
up
front
with
a
well
balanced
sour
fruit
pesence
through
the
finish
medium
body
is
well
carbonated
batch
336
pours
the
color
of
a
5050
tealemonade
from
snapple
even
has
the
same
sour
smell
as
the
5050
too
plus
the
jp
funk
this
one
has
much
more
body
than
every
other
jp
ive
had
and
is
more
sour
to
boot
the
oak
provides
a
tiny
bit
of
bittering
which
is
nicely
balanced
by
the
acidic
backbone
short
finish
with
a
bit
of
nutty
spice
of
some
sort
maybe
corriander
and
nutmeg
quite
tasty
and
worth
the
price
tag
d
modest
alcohol
and
lots
of
funk
make
for
a
great
ale
i
like
the
tartness
and
the
horse
blanket
i
like
most
everything
about
this
ale
100
reviews
deep
and
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
the
strong
oak
aged
stuff
hits
higher
notes
but
jolly
pumpkin
is
allaround
delicious
wow
im
not
even
sure
how
to
end
this
im
not
sure
if
my
rating
is
high
enough
based
upon
the
complexity
of
this
brew
it
reminds
me
a
bit
of
a
flemish
red
with
some
spicy
peppercorns
thrown
into
secondary
lovely
i
heart
jolly
pumpkin
well
done
and
tasty
but
a
touch
less
complexity
in
the
flavor
that
the
nose
led
me
to
believe
a
bit
pricey
as
usual
poured
into
my
st
bernardus
glass
a
very
nice
cloudy
golden
yellowbrown
color
nice
carbonation
nice
onefinger
plus
creamy
offwhite
head
with
some
nice
sticky
lacing
left
behind
the
nose
is
malty
yeasty
funky
with
some
oak
notes
and
spice
the
taste
is
funky
with
some
maltsyeast
nice
touch
of
oakspice
medium
body
very
drinkable
this
is
a
nice
one
recommended
d
not
good
i
have
no
idea
what
happened
to
this
beer
i
paid
too
much
for
this
quite
a
disappointment
for
a
beer
that
is
only
a
year
old
it
cost
way
too
much
to
be
a
drain
pour
so
i
soldiered
on
this
is
a
great
afternoon
type
drinking
beer
light
and
refreshing
with
interesting
flavor
poured
from
a
750ml
bomber
the
beer
is
dark
orange
with
an
adequate
wetlooking
foam
clarity
varies
as
the
bottle
drains
starts
mostly
clear
a
little
murky
maybe
finishes
with
haze
and
some
sediment
on
the
bottom
the
aroma
is
sour
and
a
little
like
a
wild
ale
but
not
as
funky
as
other
jp
beers
have
been
the
taste
confirms
it
the
sourness
is
there
but
only
as
an
accent
to
the
sweetness
from
the
malts
dry
finish
maybe
a
little
hops
in
the
aftertaste
fun
fact
had
my
mother
sample
this
much
like
most
of
my
beers
while
im
home
in
the
summer
her
response
to
it

overall
a

my
favorite
jolly

thats
not

effervescent
without

followed
by

i
could
see
this
as
being
a
very

brew
on
a
hot
day
the
body
is
closer
to
light
than
full
a
slight
dryness
with
a
good
carbonation
overall
bdgs
are
all
over
the
place
but
even
so
i
think
this
could
have
been
better
without
the
brett
then
again
if
aged
the
brett
could
come
out
and
just
finish
this
off
nicely
d
not
my
favorite
from
jolly
pumpkin
but
it
is
definitely
good
i
will
drink
it
again
very
drinkable
and
perhaps
a
a
new
thanksgiving
beer
for
me
drinkability
is
good
for
fans
of
funky
beers
which
is
what
this
one
is
all
about
i
love
me
some
funk
and
am
glad
this
had
time
to
develop
but
the
aftertaste
can
be
a
bit
much
especially
the
little
metallic
tinge
found
on
a
lot
of
jps

poured
into
a
duvel

the
taste

very
much
different
than
typical

the

mentions
chestnut
and
spices
further
discription
on

lists
the
spices
as

some

and

sour

should
be
lots
of

blackberries
as
well
as
some
dark
fruit
finishes
tart
with
a
rush
of
bourbon
slick
mouthfeel
wonderful
wonderful
beer
overall
a
very
nice
sour
beer
very
easy
to
drink
i
wish
this
wasnt
so
hard
to
find
pours
a
hazy
dark
orangebrown
with
a
foamy
beige
head
that
fades
to
nothing
no
lacing
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
sour
tart
and
funky
with
malt
fruit
and
acidic
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
sour
fruit
and
wood
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
acidity
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
really
tasty
but
has
a
much
better
sour
presence
in
the
aroma
o
i
really
look
forward
to
when
these
grand
reserves
come
out
possibly
my
favorite
one
to
date
however
we
did
have
an
older
regular
base
biere
de
garde
along
side
this
and
we
actually
all
agreed
we
preferred
that
over
this
which
was
interesting
biere
de
mars
is
a
great
beer
and
the
grand
reserve
improves
it
nicely
medium
body
milder
carbonation
dry
and
sticky
on
the
palate
this
definitely
takes
the
regular
jolly
pumpkin
beers
to
another
level
with
increased
nuances
of
flavor
and
higher
levels
of
sourness
and
acidity
o
this
is
pretty
nice
but
a
bit
lacking
in
complexity
and
carbonation
compared
to
other
notable
soured
bieres
de
garde
overall
a
very
unique
brew
that
has
complexity
written
all
over
it
justifiably
so
given
its
lengthy
aging
reminiscent
of
a
tawny
port
or
a
fine
cognac
in
all
of
its
complex
character
not
to
be
missed
if
you
are
afforded
the
rare
opportunity
to
try
this
i
will
look
forward
to
future
bottlings
if
they
do
them
again
phenomenal
brew
from
jolly
pumpkin
excellent
sour
i
was
sad
to
look
down
at
my
glass
and
find
that
it
was
empty
so
quickly
i
couldnt
keep
this
stuff
away
from
my
mouth
its
exceedingly
sour
and
tart
but
still
to
a
highly
drinkable
degree
you
wont
have
to
worry
about
it
burning
a
hole
into
your
stomach
light
funk
is
a
welcomed
accompaniment
to
the
complex
tart
and
fruity
flavor
profile
the
vinous
and
vinegar
notes
were
lovely
i
wish
this
was
released
more
often
but
i
heard
it
spends
24
months
in
barrels
i
guess
you
cant
really
argue
with
that
for
what
i
expected
bdm
gr
let
me
down
i
was
expecting
amazingness
and
it
was
only
mildly
great
jp
nailed
it
but
it
needs
more
carbonation
and
a
bigger
bottle
overall4
38
d
great
complexity
the
color
alone
is
one
of
the
most
unique
ive
seen
very
enjoyable
although
the
extreme
dry
sourness
may
limit
drinkability
a
small
pour
was
excellent
though
definitely
different
than
the
typical
jp
offering
and
offering
some
surprising
gueuze
characteristics
at
times
330ml

a
tad
bit
over
2
year
old
pours
an
almostclear
rubyamber
color
with
a
hint
of
brown
very
minimal
white
head
scent
is
out
of
this
world
such
a
great
smelling
beer
jp
always
has
a
distinct
aroma
to
them
that
lovely
barnyard
funk
they
specialize
in
with
just
the
slightest
tart
aroma
this
is
that
same
scent
but
kicked
up
a
notch
a
huge
amount
of
oak
with
some
sweet
bourbon
im
not
sure
if
the
grand
reserve
edition
is
aged
in
bourbon
barrels
but
i
get
a
hint
of
it
sweet
cherries
and
some
acidic
notes
a
bit
of
spice
as
well
very
lovely
and
complex
taste
is
just
as
complex
sour
cherries
up
front
followed
by
lovely
woodoak
flavors
and
some
lingering
bourbon
sweetness
abv
is
so
well
hidden
its
ridiculous
not
as
acidic
as
the
nose
is
but
definitely
leaves
a
sticky
feeling
on
the
gums
and
teeth
mouthfeel
is
very
dry
with
a
sticky
finish
drinkability
is
very
high
i
could
sip
on
this
beer
all
night
overall
this
was
such
a
great
experience
it
should
be
a
crime
to
bottle
this
fantastic
beer
in
such
small
bottles
this
one
is
meant
to
be
in
750ml
and
shared
amongst
friends
amazing
beer
overall
a
very
nice
true
sour
whereas
most
jp
beers
are
more
funk
than
sour
you
wouldnt
think
twice
about
it
if
somebody
blindly
poured
you
this
beer
and
told
you
it
was
from
russian
river
tart
and
complex
this
is
jps
highest
rated
beer
and
with
good
reason
o
a
great
beer
i
think
i
like
la
roja
grand
reserve
better
the
beer
pours
a
beautiful
ruby
hued
mahogany
color
little
to
no

the
nose
is
a
mélange
of
oak
sour
cherries
and
funk
the
taste
starts
out
incredibly
tart
sour
cherries
predominate
up
front
an
intense
puckering
quality
manifests
itself
midpalate
with
oak
and
wet
horse
blanket
at
play
in
the
background
the
finish
is
dry
with
a
sweet
tart
aftertaste
which
lingers
the
beer
is
light
bodied
with
an
evervescent
level
of
carbonation
that
really
adds
to
the
experience
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
probably
one
of
the
best
sours
ive
had
to
date
the
tart
sweet
funky
characteristics
flow
from
one
to
another
flawlessly
making
for
a
supremely
enjoyable
experience
wish
i
had
a
couple
of
more
of
these
recommended

notes
with
a

is
quite
full
with
low

i
tasted
more
funk
then
bourbon
to
be
honest
but
very
enjoyable
beer
from
one
of
my
favourite
brewery
o
a
good
sour
bring
on
the
tart
pours
a
nice
dark
brownish
orange
no
real
head
to
speak
of
smells
tart
almost
fruitty
cherry
coming
through
sour
and
fruity
on
the
tongue
again
i
feel
like
the
fruits
are
reminiscent
of
cherry
but
not
distinctly
very
nice
smooth
sourness
that
melds
with
the
base
malts
a
bit
low
on
the
carbonation
but
pretty
enjoyable
great
fruity
flavor
with
plenty
of
oak
with
drying
acidic
qualities
that
leave
the
palate
quenched
and
wanting
more
a
great
american
interpretation
of
the
style
something
im
glad
to
have
o
really
impressed
with
this
beer
one
of
the
first
pours
i
had
at
the
festival
i
would
say
this
is
the
best
jolly
pumpkin
beer
ive
had
and
it
will
be
hard
to
top
it
i
want
more
of
the
gr
here
i
will
be
aging
any
of
these
for
2
or
3
years
beer
is
not
as
harsh
as
it
smells
i
dont
mean
to
say
that
it
smelled
bad
but
the
acetic
character
on
the
palate
was
more
subdued
than
i
assumed
it
would
be
when
i
originally
smelled
the
beer
there
is
definitely
an
acetic
character
but
it
more
brightens
the
beer
than
makes
it
dry
or
harsh
the
beer
is
sour
but
not
tart
on
the
finish
a
little
dry
on
the
ending
and
a
lactic
creaminess
with
a
nice
bouquet
of
yeast
on
the
midpalate
i
am
not
sure
which
one
i
liked
better
i
think
this
one
suffers
from
a
solvency
but
the
flavor
is
better
id
have
it
again
the
beer
appears
a
slightly
darker
brown
than
the
biere
de
mars
with
a
bit
less
head
and
lace
the
aroma
is
funky
with
a
strong
lactic
acetic
presence
it
smells
similar
to
russian
river
consecration
which
is
definitely
a
good
thing
oak
slight
vinegar
tart
brettanomyces
acetic
definitely
worth
a
try
if
you
are
a
fan
of
funky
sour
beers
nice
beer
overall
o
decent
beer
not
amazing
but
this
one
is
pretty
good
poured
a
clear
dark
brown
color
with
a
minimal
frothy
offwhite
head
that
mostly
lasted
with
fair
lacing
moderate
to
heavy
tart
citrus
good
funk
and
wood
aroma
medium
to
full
body
with
a
sticky
texture
and
soft
carbonation
medium
to
heavy
sour
flavor
with
a
medium
to
heavy
sweet
sour
finish
of
moderate
to
long
duration
this
is
a
standout
beer
for
style
o
overall
a
really
good
beer
from
jolly
pumpkin
beer
if
you
like
their
style
this
is
acant
miss
would
like
to
have
it
again
330ml
bottle
thanks
to
auoracrisis
first
off
this
beer
was
fantastic
just
wonderful
but
i
am
already
biased
towards
the
regular
biere
de
mars
which
we
rarely
see
in
colorado
dark
red
with
a
healthy
head
at
first
that
died
quick
it
smelled
a
lot
like
the
regular
version
sour
flanders
style
beer
the
taste
however
had
a
very
pronounced
and
beautiful
oak
flavor
to
it
that
complemented
the
beer
very
well
sour
but
full
and
not
so
much
the
lemon
flavor
i
have
detected
in
biere
de
mars
i
was
actually
astonished
by
how
much
better
it
was
with
the
extended
oak
aging
fantastic
beer
hv
o
im
really
happy
with
the
one
great
smell
flavor
and
fantastic
mouthfeel
ive
had
a
couple
offerings
from
jolly
pumpkin
and
this
is
by
far
the
best
one
yet
id
really
like
more
to
age
or
just
drink
right
away
a
must
try
damn
this
is
by
far
the
best
jp
beer
i
have
ever
had
the
flavor
and
aroma
are
killer
good
to
know
jolly
pumpkin
can
really
make
something
exceptional
o
this
is
a
beer
i
could
drink
all
day
overall
pretty
darn
good
if
your
in
the
mood
for
an
intensely
sour
and
complex
experience
that
mood
strikes
me
often
drinkability
is
good
i
enjoyed
this
a
bit
more
than
the
luciérnaga
grand
reserve
the
nose
is
good
and
the
flavor
is
on
par
or
better
than
most
american
wilds
definitely
worth
checking
out
if
you
can
find
a
bottle
wish
i
had
another
one
in
the
cellar
to
see
how
it
develops
i
quite
like
this
one
would
go
great
with
some
grapes
and
some
cheese
pours
a
hazy
deep
amber
to
brown
in
color
with
a
small
light
tan
head
in
the
aroma
big
sour
nice
big
tart
white
grape
smells
in
the
taste
tart
white
grape
starting
sour
to
a
nice
yeasty
dryness
in
the
end
a
smooth
and
medium
to
light
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
small
dry
tart
fruit
in
the
aftertaste
nice
big
tartness
mellow
body
i
love
you
jolly
pumpkin
nice
beer
to
explore
as
you
watch
a
football
game
one
to
take
your
time
with
drinkability
nonexistent
alcohol
clean
crisp
and
refreshing
i
have
another
one
of
these
in
my
cellar
and
cant
wait
to
try
it
with
a
year
on
it
this
is
my
favorite
jp
experience
yet
due
to
the
complexities
of
this
beer
i
have
not
found
in
other
jp
offerings
yet
i
still
consider
them
relatively
complex
so
that
is
saying
something
a
perfect
beer
for
my
300th
review
cheers
all
d
the
exchange
of
oak
and
funk
is
interesting
especially
for
a
jp
beer
the
crescendo
of
the
funk
its
really
coming
close
to
edging
out
the
barrel
is
amazing
pleasant
but
definitely
not
great
d
cornucopia
of
flavors
very
complex
drinkable
for
sure
but
definitely
a
sipper
d
like
most
of
jolly
pumpkins
beers
this
is
a
good
one
i
havent
had
the
regular
biere
de
mars
but
this
has
inspired
me
to
pick
one
up
at
some
point
pours
a
reddish
copper
with
an
off
white
head
and
a
good
amount
of
lacing
as
it
goes
down
nose
is
incredibly
complex
i
get
tart
green
apples
ripe
cherries
brown
sugar
hints
of
caramel
a
bit
of
vinegar
and
maybe
a
little
bit
of
lemon
taste
draws
all
the
flavors
together
quite
well
and
adds
a
bit
of
extra
funk
mouthfeel
comes
from
both
acetic
and
lactic
sourness
quite
drinkable
although
maybe
a
bit
over
the
top
in
any
relatively
large
quantity
most
jp
beers
are
blah
to
me
but
this
is
something
id
like
to
have
more
of
pretty
good
beer
not
amazing
but
good
the
pour
produced
two
fingers
worth
of
thick
foamy
creamy
yellowishtan
head
with
good
retention
color
was
a
deepamber
with
nequality
clarity
and
a
high
level
of
effervescence
nose
had
notes
of
green
apple
cider
and
cheddar
cheese
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
a
slightly
sour
cherry
taste
but
not
so
sour
as
to
be
offputting
finish
had
a
very
cherrylike
flavor
macerated
cherries
in
liqueur
as
one
person
put
it
or
kirsch
another
way
mmm
overall
wow
a
stunning
example
of
the
style
and
a
stunning
beer
in
general
really
glad
i
brought
this
one
with
me
d
overall
pretty
good
for
the
style
i
am
not
well
versed
in
biere
de
gardes
but
i
enjoyed
this
one
thanks
guys
the
beer
tastes
tart
and
sour
cherries
up
front
a
long
aftertaste
is
even
more
sour
reminds
me
a
little
of
red
poppy
which
is
also
excellent
the
body
is
light
and
dry
it
seems
just
about
right
i
dont
know
why
a
beer
always
seems
so
hard
to
get
again
im
pretty
sure
its
a
special
release
at
the
brewery
only
the
mouthfeel
is
so
smooth
the
barrel
flavor
calms
all
of
the
incredibly
tart
flavors
that
are
originally
in
this
beer
just
an
amazing
flavor
that
goes
down
smooth
probably
the
best
jolly
pumpkin
beer
i
have
had
and
that
is
saying
something
special
overall
an
exceptional
beer
for
my
100th
review
by
far
my
favorite
jolly
pumpkin
offering
so
far
danother
great
beer
from
jp
perfectly
balanced
tart
and
malt
i
wish
i
had
more
of
these
if
i
had
to
nit
pick
id
say
a
hair
more
carbonation
would
bring
out
more
of
the
aroma
but
whatever
this
is
near
perfect
man
i
havent
revisited
jolly
pumpkin
and
i
forgot
how
good
their
stuff
was
this
is
a
fantastic
oak
aged
beer
and
super
drinkable
batch
346348
the
beer
pours
light
brown
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
tart
with
some
lemons
yeast
and
oak
the
flavor
is
brown
sugar
lemon
brett
funk
and
oak
the
tartness
lingers
and
makes
the
beer
very
drinkable
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
another
great
sour
from
jp
seems
to
lack
the
bourbon
presence
found
in
earlier
batches
but
still
an
outstanding
beer
d
surprisingly
easy
to
drink
for
how
heavy
of
a
beer
i
love
sour
beers
and
this
one
has
set
the
bar
for
me
it
might
be
13
a
bottle
but
its
the
same
price
of
a
decent
wine
treat
it
that
way
d
this
was
a
very
easy
and
smooth
drinker
sours
have
this
way
with
me
though
i
hope
to
be
able
to
get
my
hands
on
this
again
and
if
you
want
a
good
sour
please
do
yourself
a
favor
and
drink
this
at
first
not
as
good
in
flavor
as
nose
but
still
very
good
mouthfeel
is
light
crisp
and
light
carbonation
tartness
is
mild
vinegar
isnt
as
bitey
as
anticipated
the
fruitcitrus
notes
are
light
the
oak
aspect
is
not
prominent
but
noticable
nonetheless
a
recomendation
if
i
may
drink
at
cellar
temp
flavor
and
sharpness
really
stand
out
as
the
beer
warms
up
im
enjoying
this
brew
slowly
not
because
its
heavy
or
hard
to
drink
but
because
im
naturally
wanting
to
enjoy
every
single
flavor
in
the
delectable
concoction
its
an
amazingly
mellow
and
bright
brew
with
some
beautiful
flavors
sourhaters
not
to
worry
there
is
a
slight
sour
but
a
perfect
balance
i
know
im
not
ubercritical
of
every
beer
because
i
try
to
find
the
positives
in
every
one
there
have
only
been
a
couple
beers
that
have
been
released
in
the
past
year
or
so
that
have
blown
me
away
this
is
definitely
one
of
them
cherries
tart
red
grapes
tannic
red
wine
theres
a
lot
going
on
in
this
one
the
barrel
character
is
substantial
lending
a
big
tannic
backbone
that
melds
nicely
with
the
vinous
qualities
theres
a
touch
of
malt
in
the
midpalate
that
drops
off
again
near
the
finish
replaced
by
tart
cherries
and
raisins
the
finish
is
bready
and
surprisingly
brief
it
ends
on
a
clean
slightly
lactic
note
this
is
another
winner
from
jp
d
wish
i
had
more
than
the
one
bottle
one
of
the
best
sours
i
have
ever
tried
the
body
is
medium
and
carbonation
is
low
overall
this
beer
was
nice
but
perhaps
a
little
oaky
and
lacking
depth
in
the
flavor
profile
still
worth
taking
a
crack
at
overall
one
of
jps
best
and
theyre
the
daniel
san
of
the
beer
world
the
underdog
that
kicks
the
cobra
kais
ass
ron
and
crew
youre
the
best
around
no
ones
gonna
ever
keep
you
down
oak
apple
vanilla
infection
layers
of
fruit
wood
spcey
carbonation
long
finish
cherry
pear
cider
like
carbonation
is
bright
and
vivid
and
in
your
face
amazing
im
pretty
new
to
hand
pulled
beers
but
i
was
surprised
to
see
this
one
come
out
of
the
cask
looking
like
a
glass
full
of
head
slowly
however
the
murky
brown
beer
crept
up
the
glass
until
only
a
medium
sized
light
brown
head
was
left
looked
delicious
even
at
11
am
after
my
morning
coffee
the
smell
is
dominated
by
sourness
and
tart
fruit
cherries
maybe
the
is
a
red
wine
vinegar
quality
and
some
oak
the
aroma
indicates
this
one
isnt
going
to
be
messing
around
wonderful
tasting
beer
and
i
dont
even
like
belgiany
sour
beers
that
much
hugely
sour
with
a
tart
fruitiness
oak
and
leather
while
ive
never
actually
chewed
on
leather
this
is
what
came
to
mind
some
pleasant
funkiness
too
great
sipper
while
i
cant
compare
the
cask
version
to
the
regular
the
cask
had
a
wonderfully
fluffy
lightly
carbonated
mouthfeel
served
at
a
perfect
temperature
i
imagine
this
is
the
right
way
to
enjoy
this
one
i
only
had
the
one
because
it
was
a
monday
morning
but
had
it
been
a
saturday
i
could
have
sat
at
the
bar
drinking
these
all
day
great
beer
and
a
great
quiet
subdued
release
really
a
good
morning

thanks
goes
out
to
ron
j
and
mike
d
s
i
didnt
like
this
as
much
as
the
original
vintage
luciernaga
grand
reserve
but
they
are
both
high
up
on
my
list
so
far
jolly
pumpkin
is
2
for
2
with
me
when
it
comes
to
the
reserve
series
top
notch
d
this
is
probably
my
favorite
jolly
pumpkin
brew
easy
drinking
rich
in
flavor
with
no
palate
destroying
flavors
i
wish
it
released
more
often
but
i
suppose
you
can
rush
all
those
months
in
the
barrel
cant
wait
to
see
what
the
next
release
brings
d
tasty
brew
but
id
really
like
to
see
more
sourness
and
funk
very
easy
to
drink
d
good
another
tasty
rare
jolly
pumpkin
treat
mouthfeel
is
smooth
arid
and
easy
to
drink
with
steady
carbonation
this
is
an
incredibly
drinkable
elixir
and
i
wouldnt
mind
a
750ml
bottle
of
this
right
now
really
glad
to
have
had
the
chance
to
sample
this
one
keep
it
up
jp
d
a
very
nice
sipper
that
is
very
enjoyable
great
beer
not
only
tasty
but
also
extremely
characterful
and
interesting
to
drink
the
beer
pours
a
brownish
amber
color
with
good
head
retention
and
ok
lacing
while
the
beer
doesnt
look
particularly
unusual
or
special
that
thought
was
quickly
dispensed
once
i
breathed
in
the
aroma
the
nose
on
this
beer
is
quite
distinct
consisting
of
vanilla
prunes
sour
cherry
and
light
funk
not
sure
what
the
regular
jp
beire
de
mars
is
like
but
im
impressed
by
how
dialed
down
the
funk
and
sour
component
is
on
this
version
the
added
vanilla
component
really
helps
imho
and
i
found
the
nose
on
this
beer
quite
enticing
flavors
on
the
palate
replicate
the
nose
though
they
were
a
bit
more
muted
then
i
was
expecting
also
the
beer
was
surprisingly
dry
with
no
more
then
some
light
sourness
on
the
finish
otherwise
the
beer
has
some
nice
vanilla
and
citrus
to
it
not
entirely
sure
that
extended
barrel
aging
has
benefited
this
beer
all
that
much
though
it
was
still
quite
enjoyable
to
drink
mouthfeel
is
fairly
light
but
with
a
long
drawn
out
finish
and
drinkability
is
exceptional
the
alcohol
is
very
well
disguised
and
with
the
no
more
then
light
sour
component
this
is
probably
one
of
the
most
drinkable
beers
ive
had
from
jp
nice
stuff
the
palate
has
a
rather
enjoyable
blend
of
lactic
sourness
quite
clean
with
a
touch
of
lemon
the
funk
is
a
blend
of
mildly
mustydamp
cellar
notes
with
a
rotting
fruit
note
especially
on
the
backend
theres
a
rather
surprising
lack
of
vinegar
here
very
clean
lactic
sourness
almost
yogurt
like
especially
on
the
finish
this
is
to
the
detriment
of
the
taste
though
as
it
scrubs
off
some
of
the
funk
moderate
barrel
character
oak
vanilla
and
bourbon
on
the
finish
this
is
leathery
drying
and
pretty
awesome
highly
recommended
4

d
not
too
sour
that
it
must
be
sipped
although
i
do
recommend
that
it
be
savored
by
far
the
tastiest
jp
ive
tried
the
bourbon
barrel
aging
has
kicked
it
up
to
the
next
level
quite
vineous
and
complex
the
typical
lactic
quality
found
in
other
jps
has
some
ramped
up
acid
levels
also
huge
thanks
to
theblackmallard
thanks
brewdan
for
the
opportunity
of
all
the
jolly
pumpkin
grand
reserves
i
prefer
this
one
medium
body
and
carbonation
suits
well
for
the
beer
very
acetic
acidic
and
tannic
in
the
finish
wow
drinkability
is
ok
the
acidity
is
pretty
strong
which
definitely
takes
away
from
the
drinkability
i
think
if
this
one
dialed
back
the
sourvinegar
component
a
little
to
let
those
other
components
through
itd
really
shine
still
a
tasty
and
interesting
brew
caramel
coloured
fairly
clear
with
a
little
bit
of
beige
foam
that
formed
a
thin
collar
some
spotty
lacing
the
aroma
was
sort
of
sharp
tart
and
vinegar
with
a
bit
of
alcohol
some
funk
and
earth
sweetness
hit
up
front
but
faded
fast
very
sour
citric
and
acetic
seemed
a
little
thin
on
malt
but
it
was
certainly
there
light
bodied
with
lowish
carbonation
offdry
this
one
seemed
a
bit
one
dimensional
after
all
the
other
amazing
sours
wed
been
enjoying
it
was
quite
acidic
but
still
refreshing
and
flavourful
pours
a
crystal
clear
reddish

thin
white

settles
to

russ
stellar
beer
all
around
incredibly
complex
on
the
nose
and
palate
i
cant
do
the
aroma
and
flavor
justice
with
words
kudos
to
jp
on
investing
in
making
this
beer
27
months
in
oak
is
a
long
time
too
bad
this
is
so
rare
and
this
is
my
only
bottle
thanks
again
hans
picked
up
for
me
by
kkulacki
in
march
and
held
until
now
only
because
he
shared
a
bottle
with
me
3
months
ago
meaning
i
wasnt
foaming
at
the
mouth
to
taste
it
cant
wait
any
longer
though
reddish
terra
cotta
color
little
whitish
film
of
bubbles
with
a
ring
around
the
glass
smells
madly
sour
malty
hints
of
vanilla
big
sour
blast
but
tempered
by
the
oak
with
nice
vanilla
tones
and
a
creamy
malt
backbone
gooseberry
raspberry
and
tart
cherry
fruit
flavors
as
well
as
lactic
acid
sourness
and
a
hint
of
brett
oak
flavor
grows
and
really
complements
the
tartness
this
is
a
delicious
beer
tremendously
smooth
and
tasty
a
real
treat
way
to
go
jp
rons
wife
said
it
was
the
sourest
beer
theyve
ever
produced
and
i
think
im
inclined
to
agree
with
them
if
you
like
your
sour
tastebuds
tickled
this
has
your
name
written
all
over
it
im
definitely
glad
i
have
a
few
more
of
these
d
this
is
an
excellent
wild
ale
its
good
to
taste
one
of
these
from
the
us
thats
excellent
and
not
from
russian
river
pours
an
amberorange
in
color
only
a
little
bit
of
froth
on
top
but
that
quickly
disappears
smell
is
funky
oak
not
getting
any
bourbon
in
the
nose
just
the
nice
vanilla
and
lots
of
oak
from
the
barrels
taste
is
plenty
of
sour
with
a
lot
more
of
the
oak
settling
in
on
the
back
end
of
the
taste
i
would
like
just
a
hint
of
bourbon
but
this
is
all
oak
easy
drinking
not
thin
or
over
carbonated
very
good
this
is
very
nice
i
was
really
expecting
the
bourbon
to
be
too
much
here
but
instead
it
adds
a
bit
more
complexity
without
being
overbearing
too
soon
this
beer
is
gone
a
12oz
bottle
was
just
not
enough
of
this
one
pours
a
murky
dark
amber
with
a
half
finger
offwhite
head
that
quickly
dies
down
to
a
ring
of
bubbles
hardly
any
lacing
left
on
the
sides
probably
the
funkiest
smelling
beer
ive
put
my
nose
too
sour
dark
fruits
some
vinegar
and
wet
oak
dominate
the
smell
a
good
amount
of
pepper
and
spice
are
detected
as
well
taste
begins
with
sour
cherries
apple
cider
and
more
oak
the
27
months
of
aging
truly
shine
in
the
flavor
some
caramel
vanilla
and
maple
syrup
linger
on
the
tongue
with
a
wet
lemonlime
aftertaste
pretty
funky
through
and
through
with
this
one
but
i
like
it
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
very
active
carbonation
that
stings
the
entire
mouth
from
start
to
finish
very
complex
beer
and
surprisingly
easy
to
put
down
so
glad
i
had
the
opportunity
to
try
this
once
in
a
lifetime
beer
thanks
again
adam
very
limited
with
only
17
cases
produced
overall
this
was
really
a
great
beer
the
complexity
alone
would
make
this
one
to
sip
rather
than
drink
i
already
had
a
high
regard
for
jolly
pumpkins
beer
but
ron
has
really
outdone
himself
with
this
one
and
surpassed
the
already
high
standard
his
brews
have
set
its
just
too
bad
that
this
was
such
a
limited
release
but
i
guess
thats
the
price
of
this
level
of
quality
starts
with
plenty
of
acidity
and
sour
fruits
marmalade
on
toast
comes
through
along
with
smooth
oak
slightly
moldy
tart
raspberries
take
over
the
palate
some
acidic
metallic
citric
puckering
around
the
edges
finish
features
lingering
raspberry
tartness
aged
balsamic
vinegar
and
vanilla
mediumfull
body
with
enough
prickly
carbonation
to
lift
the
acidic
tartness
off
the
tongue
wow
ive
had
most
of
rons
released
jp
beers
and
i
would
say
that
this
is
the
sourest
ive
had
still
has
great
complexity
though
originally
reviewed
november

2006
12
oz
bottle
apple
candy
aroma
with
a
touch
of
apricots
mellowed
in
ale
yet
with
some
peculiar
edges
of
old
woman
perfume
some
of
the
alcohol
notes
are
deep
and
dark
with
edges
of
caramel
pour
of
a
rich
deep
caramel
firey
in
glowing
orange
witha
thin
rim
of
whitish
flavor
is
a
somewhat
confused
melange
of
bright
awakening
acidity
in
apple
skin
and
white
grape
juice
with
caramel
syrup
dangling
with
a
fast
flow
of
balsamic
vinegar
between
fading
into
a
mellow
fragrant
lemon
hop
smack
yet
remaining
lightly
subdues
some
of
the
nosestinging
acidity
creates
some
balance
however
the
flavor
of
this
beer
alights
some
muddines
and
subtleness
with
a
little
less
distinctive
qualities
its
still
a
deliciously
complete
package
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
wild
with
the
oaky
tannins
and
tartness
coming
together
before
the
swallow
poured
into
a
rapscallion
glass
formed
a
dense
12
beige
head
over
the
cloudy
red
brew
lacing
is
heavy
and
coating
aroma
is
fruity
and
tart
taste
is
lightly
malty
upfront
mildly
tart
in
the
middle
with
an
oaky
close
sounds
simple
but
it
all
comes
together
so
nicely
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
both
excellent
with
the
wood
perhaps
offsetting
the
sometimes
overthetop
tartness
very
nice
one
here
thank
you
tim
trbeer
for
the
chance
to
try
this
rare
gem
perfect
mouthfeel
with
the
unique
flavors
and
oddities
that
all
tie
together
in
the
end
i
could
drink
this
all
night
the
complexity
might
be
too
much
for
me
though
after
a
few
who
knows
this
stuff
was
amazing
the
best
jp
offering
ive
had
so
far
big
thanks
