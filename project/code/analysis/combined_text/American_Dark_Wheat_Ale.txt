NA
i
had
the
chance
to
meet
the
brewer
when
i
was
there
seems
to
be
a
good
guy
with
great
ideas
o
i
love
this
style
of
beer
and
this
is
worth
a
try
nothing
that
knocks
your
socks
off
but
a
decent
brew
id
look
forward
to
tasting
some
other
brews
from
this
brewery
to
get
a
better
sense
of
what
theyre
about
overall
i
found
this
to
be
a
confusing
beer
and
is
not
one
i
would
want
to
pick
up
again
some
of
my
friends
had
tried
this
beer
before
and
mentioned
that
it
had
a
slight
sourness
so
i
am
not
sold
on
infection
being
the
reason
for
the
odd
taste
overall
a
pretty
poor
beer
overall
i
was
not
impressed
with
this
beer
it
did
not
meet
any
of
my
octoberfest
expectations
this
beer
poured
dark
brwon
in
color
with
a
slight
coudiness
this
could
have
been
from
the
colder
serving
tempurature
as
it
dissipated
a
bit
after
sitting
the
color
was
also
a
little
darker
that
many
oktoberfests
i
noticed
a
mild
hoppy
and
grainy
aroma
on
the
quarterinch
head
the
beer
presents
as
a
wheat
in
the
mouth
and
has
a
slight
chocolatemalt
flavor
in
the
taste
profile
unique
twist
on
an
oktoberfest
d
a
nice
flavor
profile
that
is
not
a
typical
marzen
but
is
much
more
delightful
d
a
boring
beer
but
it
goes
down
nicely
hopefully
other
offerings
from
this
brewery
are
a
bit
more
exciting
NA
overall
simply
a
delicious
beer
to
me
and
im
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
this
was
a
nice
surprise
from
paris
of
a
beer
i
otherwise
would
never
have
the
opportunity
to
try
thanks
buddy
a
soso
version
of
the
style
that
drinks
easy
but
just
doesnt
say
drink
more
has
some
real
stong
brown
ale
tendencies
more
than
dark
wheat
ale
better
than
most
from
these
guys
brown
like
a
glass
of
tea
except
with
a
small
tan
head
that
clears
out
quickly
and
leaves
no
trace
smells
of
very
sweet
malts
and
some
ripe
bananas
a
little
raw
earthiness
is
embedded
thin
and
a
bit
grainy
on
the
tongue
with
a
slight
residual
spice
and
a
fruity
undercurrent
i
guess
that
pretty
much
sums
it
up
d
didnt
taste
anything
like
a
wheat
brew
again
this
brew
tastes
more
like
an
irish
red
ale
pours
a
deeper
amber
color
thin
offwhite
head
sweeter
caramel
notes
in
the
aroma
with
a
fruity
yeastiness
it
doesnt
smell
or
taste
much
like
any
wheat
beer
ive
had
and
i
wish
i
could
say
that
in
a
more
positive
way
it
falls
on
the
sweeter
side
up
front
caramel
and
a
certain
almost
harsh
bitterness
in
the
finish
not
really
bad
but
not
really
for
me
NA
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
a
bit
light
nicely
carbonated
not
a
bad
beer
but
one
that
also
provides
a
check
in
the
box
for
my103
beer
style
on
tap
at
at
mollys
in
hanover
nh
a
dark
amber
pour
with
a
bit
of
head
that
lingers
and
makes
for
a
decent
pattern
of
lacing
an
interesting
scent
and
im
not
sure
what
to
expect
maltiness
or
hoppiness
i
get
both
a
unique
combo
of
toasted
malt
and
piney
bitterness
with
a
touch
of
pineapple
fruit
for
a
session
ale
which
i
often
find
lacking
for
flavor
this
stood
up
nicely
i
would
have
liked
a
bit
more
carbonation
but
overall
this
was
a
perfectly
decent
and
original
beer
that
i
would
try
again
o
this
is
one
beer
that
broken
down
is
better
in
parts
than
when
its
all
put
together
there
is
a
solid
malt
foundation
in
both
the
nose
and
the
flavor
but
it
doesnt
seem
to
stand
up
to
the
hops
which
come
across
as
completely
separate
from
the
malty
base
especially
in
the
aftertaste
hops
are
a
bit
too
minerally
and
slightly
metallic
pour
is
transparent
caramel
color
with
a
fairly
tight
white
head
nose
is
slightly
burnt
toast
caramel
malts
and
a
faint
herbal
grassy
hop
flavor
follows
a
bit
thin
up
front
burnt
toast
sweet
caramel
malt
overly
bitter
hop
presence
herbal
and
hay
like
finish
solid
flavor
profile
with
a
contrast
of
toasted
grains
and
bright
hops
but
the
whole
experience
feels
a
bit
watered
down
it
just
doesnt
hold
the
strength
and
depth
of
flavors
it
needs
to
be
above
average
the
flavors
seem
to
disappear
from
the
palate
almost
immediately
really
great
tasting
beer
nice
aroma
finish
pours
a
reddish
brown
with
a
small
white
head
the
nose
starts
with
a
nice
presence
of
pine
light
citrus
and
subtle
caramel
there
are
hints
of
pineapple
but
theyre
incredibly
subtle
on
the
palate
the
body
is
medium
to
light
and
heavily
carbonated
the
hoppy
elements
like
pine
grass
and
grapefruit
take
the
forefront
over
subtle
brown
sugar
and
caramel
flavors
with
just
a
hint
of
bread
the
flavors
are
very
straightforward
and
theres
an
undercurrent
of
flavor
similar
to
a
wheat
beer
on
the
ending
theres
a
brighter
fruit
note
like
a
stone
fruit
or
a
pineapple
that
just
winks
in
before
defaulting
back
to
citrus
pine
and
pumpernickel
bread
the
finish
is
definitely
hoppy
strong
toast
bordering
on
being
burnt
is
my
first
impression
the
swallow
features
a
solid
bittering
hop
this
is
enhanced
by
the
dryness
of
the
beer
a
bit
thin
but
the
bubbles
are
also
muted
so
it
works
the
taste
is
bit
more
exuberant
with
a
firm
roasted
malt
character
bananas
sweetness
and
a
low
to
medium
bitterness
finishing
it
off
im
a
bit
late
in
drinking
this
one
but
it
was
a
harsh
winter
around
here
and
it
only
feels
like
yesterday
overall
unsure
flavors
good
aroma
good
balanced
easy
drinking
just
watery
i
keepw
anting
to
like
peak
because
i
like
what
they
are
doing
but
they
remain
a
little
hitormiss
for
me
this
was
close
to
a
solid
score
except
for
the
mouthfeel
overall
its
an
enjoyable
wintery
wheat
beer
a
nice
break
from
the
stouts
and
porters
that
dominate
the
winter
seasonals
also
a
nice
nod
to
the
fact
that
organic
beer
can
also
be
good
beer
if
you
blinded
tasted
this
with
someone
theres
no
way
they
would
guess
it
was
an
organic
or
healthconscious
beer
style
overall
a
good
but
not
great
winter
session
ale
i
would
get
this
again
but
i
dont
think
ill
actively
seek
it
out
in
the
near
future
overall
for
my
preference
its
not
bad
for
a
few
sips
but
i
wouldnt
go
for
it
again
and
thats
only
because
im
not
crazy
about
the
hops
i
think
this
beer
gets
rapped
due
to
being
organic
and
also
not
really
being
a
wheat
beer
needs
to
be
tasted
blind
i
found
it
a
hoppy
sessionable
approachable
catty
long
finish
ipa
would
gladly
enjoy
again
overall
its
just
another
reminder
why
i
steer
clear
of
organic
beer
the
nutty
malt
which
is
almost
like
peanuts
and
the
bright
citrus
herbal
hop
combination
is
a
bit
different
so
it
definitely
gives
a
unique
taste
but
it
still
stands
out
as
a
unique
must
try
beer
in
my
opinion
definatly
sessionable
and
a
clean
beer
thats
really
all
i
can
say
about
this
beer
as
a
true
beer
geek
this
is
not
something
i
would
seek
out
half
finger
head
with
nice
lacing
on
a
clear
amber
with
a
very
slight
golden
hue
body
aroma
of
earthy
hops
caramel
toasted
malts
and
sweet
breads
flavor
is
nicely
balanced
with
earthy
and
bready
flavors
and
sweetness
with
wheats
and
rye
medium
body
and
moderate
carbonation
fairly
certain
this
is
the
first
of
this
style
i
have
had
very
drinkable
and
flavorful
enjoyable
session
beer
but
not
particularly
a
winter
ale
a
highly
drinkable
hoppy
ale
great
flavor
highly
sessionable
and
fresh
definitely
will
have
this
again
this
is
my
first
dark
wheat
ale
i
didnt
really
know
what
to
expect
this
was
surprisingly
hoppy
and
flavorful
it
has
surprising
depth
for
a
wheat
ale
this
isnt
at
all
a
bad
beer
i
could
definitely
drink
a
lot
of
these
its
also
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
the
other
heavy
or
overspiced
winter
offerings
overall
a
tasty
hop
forward
winter
beer
o
i
was
surprised
at
how
much
this
beer
impressed
me
it
turned
me
on
to
the
style
ill
be
trying
any
dark
wheats
that
i
can
get
my
hands
on
american
dark
wheat
eh
i
dont
mind
this
ill
seek
out
more
this
one
here
is
good
good
yes
o
overall
i
am
very
impressed
very
refreshing
winter
ale
not
heavy
by
any
means
not
filled
with
a
bunch
of
spices
doesnt
let
me
down
sure
i
do
like
the
heavy
winter
warmers
but
i
think
the
winter
session
ale
is
a
good
concept
and
this
example
is
well
executed
o
a
good
winter
session
beer
could
definitely
drink
a
few
of
these
a
nice
bright
amber
with
an
off
white
head
that
doesnt
hang
around
its
got
a
nice
hop
nose
piney
citrusy
the
taste
falls
short
a
quick
hop
blast
falls
into
a
garlicky
middle
and
then
fades
into
cloying
wheaty
finish
it
goes
down
smooth
and
would
be
easy
to
drink
a
couple
overall
not
a
bad
seasonal
beer
interesting
just
wish
the
aroma
wasnt
so
off
maybe
blending
in
some
more
hops
would
help
a
clear
mahogany
colored
winter
ale
with
an
impressive
eggshell
cover
and
tenacious
lacing
the
aroma
has
tart
rhubarb
yeast
and
strawberry
caramelvanilla
very
interesting
i
like
it
the
flavor
brings
more
tart
lemony
malt
with
a
bit
of
gingernutmeg
its
a
little
aqueous
in
feel
mediumlight
bodied
with
mild
but
tingly
carbonation
i
get
a
little
bit
of
an
evergreen
hop
that
makes
this
an
overall
enjoyable
change
up
for
the
winter
months
pours
a
clear
copper
with
a
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
wheat
and
some
onion
garlic
and
herbal
hop
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
very
earthy
flavor
on
the
finish
there
is
a
medium
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
average
beer
with
the
onion
and
garlic
aromas
and
flavors
i
am
not
a
fan
of
cheers
and
have
a
safe
winter
o
this
is
a
delicious
session
beer
ill
buy
a
case
if
it
is
on
sale
poured
into
5oz
taster
glass
til
gone
really
nice
white
head
with
dark
brownish
color
and
with
a
little
lacing
smell
is
lacking
and
tastes
better
than
smells
i
never
had
dark
wheat
before
but
tastes
and
looks
are
great
just
lacks
smell
that
would
balance
everything
tastes
malts
and
light
toastyness
that
is
pleasant
and
a
hint
of
wheat
mild
carb
and
easy
to
drink
so
ill
have
another
im
sure
its
old
being
june
but
still
enjoyed
and
like
organic
beer
for
flavor
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
brown
color
with
amber
hues
and
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
hops
some
spice
and
malts
taste
is
good
some
hoppy
bitterness
up
front
followed
by
toasted
malts
a
touch
of
wheat
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
quality
beer
o
very
light
and
really
easy
to
drink
a
very
sessionable
beer
i
really
like
the
spice
hint
that
i
get
in
this
beer
i
missed
most
of
the
seasonals
this
winter
as
i
was
busy
hustling
and
spending
my
meager
finances
on
the
wife
and
kids
this
is
a
pleasant
find
at
the
end
of
the
winter
a
clear
light
brown
fluid
with
a
smallish
off
white
head
it
recedes
after
a
moment
and
there
is
a
good
amount
of
lacing
on
the
glass
smell
is
buttery
with
a
roasted
graininess
and
a
mild
hop
blend
of
earth
and
light
citrus
taste
is
quite
nice
with
a
malty
front
of
lightly
sweet
bread
and
maybe
a
touch
of
dark
roasted
wheat
with
butter
finish
is
dry
with
a
firm
hop
bitterness
both
earthy
and
citrus
nice
weight
enough
heft
for
the
winter
while
not
being
heavy
and
with
a
lovely
light
smooth
carbonation
i
went
through
my
bottle
quickly
and
since
this
is
a
session
ale
that
would
be
appropriate
nice
winter
session
ale
indeed
pours
a
clear
brown
color
with
a
fingers
of
head
the
aroma
is
very
nice
its
got
a
very
rich
banquet
of
some
strong
citrus
and
floral
hops
along
with
sweet
toffee
the
taste
is
also
quite
good
its
got
a
little
something
here
for
everyone
piney
citrus
hops
come
through
first
followed
by
some
wheat
with
the
finish
providing
some
nice
toffee
and
coffee
flavors
the
mouthfeel
is
wellcarbonated
and
light
but
the
finish
provides
just
a
slight
drying
effect
that
together
with
the
ending
roast
is
quite
satisfying
the
drinkability
is
very
good
overall
this
one
took
me
by
surprise
its
a
fairly
unique
winter
seasonal
brew
that
hits
a
ton
of
different
flavors
without
seeming
disjointed
o
a
great
beer
i
will
be
having
another
overall
ive
had
one
or
two
brews
by
peak
organic
at
pubs
in
the
us
but
i
havent
formed
a
clear
impression
of
them
yet
they
have
some
very
interesting
sounding
beers
and
i
do
hope
to
get
my
hands
on
more
this
one
is
promising
poured
into
a
standard
pint
glass
a
clear
amberbrown
with
a
frothy
one
finger
white
head
atopi
expected
some
haze
with
this
being
a
wheat
ale
the
citra
hops
come
thru
nicely
giving
some
piney
and
citric
notes
mixed
with
molassesa
nice
mix
a
little
thin
in
the
feel
it
seems
to
take
a
little
away
from
some
flavor
depth
the
cita
hops
play
arole
on
the
palate
giving
off
some
grapefruit
qualities
and
there
is
some
raw
nuttiness
as
well
but
again
that
thinner
feel
stops
the
complexities
in
their
tracks
this
is
close
to
being
good
but
the
malt
bill
needs
to
be
bumped
up
a
little
o
this
has
good
drinkability
it
is
smooth
and
the
flavor
is
nice
i
could
drink
a
few
pints
of
this
overall
i
think
it
is
a
nice
and
interesting
beer
this
is
my
first
dark
wheat
ale
but
i
would
like
to
find
some
more
i
really
liked
the
balance
between
the
toasted
malts
and
the
citrus
hop
flavor
it
just
worked
for
me
it
is
worth
trying
out
pours
a
clean
orangeish
color
with
an
off
white
head
in
the
aroma
gingerbread
like
and
a
note
of
peppermint
in
the
taste
orange
citrus
and
just
a
touch
minty
a
smooth
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
small
dry
orange
citrus
hop
like
aftertaste
tastes
of
orange
citrus
with
the
hops
but
fresh
hop
like
brings
the
mint
like
note
overall
really
surprised
by
this
one
almost
drinks
like
a
pale
ale
as
i
found
the
wheat
character
didnt
show
through
much
but
you
should
still
try
it
notes
i
like
what
they
did
with
the
hopping
here
the
lemony
citrus
notes
perfectly
accentuate
the
other
flavors
without
stealing
the
show
i
do
detect
some
butterscotch
here
too
as
i
have
in
some
of
peaks
other
beers
product
of
ringwood
yeast
at
any
rate
i
dont
find
it
offensive
here
this
isnt
one
of
those
holiday
spiced
winter
beers
its
a
warm
your
chest
from
the
inside
type
of
beer
pleasant
enough
but
kind
of
a
meh
beer
definitely
a
sessionable
beer
boring
beer
dont
waste
your
time
peak
organic
winter
session
ale
pours
a
bright
deep
copper
with
a
nice
fluffy
off
white
head
the
aroma
is
pleasantly
hoppy
with
some
nice
grapefruit
and
pine
there
is
a
nice
toasted
malt
aroma
in
the
background
a
bit
of
caramel
malt
pops
up
first
in
the
flavor
showcasing
a
nice
solid

backbone
the
piney
herbal
and
citrusy

pop
up
quickly
with
a
really
nice
tangy

that
borders
on
resins
the
moderate
bitterness
lingers
in
the
finish
but
is
never
overpowering
this
is
an
excellent
and
balance
beer
that
does
a
nice
job
of
showcasing
both
malt

me
with

just
be

anyways
lots
of
layers
of
flavor
for
a
relatively
low
abv
beer
very
nice
i
am
really
liking
this
one
and
love
the
fact
that
someone
made
a
christmaswinter
brew
that
isnt
going
to
kick
my
ass
and
wreck
my
palate
good
one
peak
d
this
beer
was
a
pleasant
suprise
im
not
sure
if
its
fully
representative
of
the
style
but
still
an
interesting
and
tasty
brew
i
will
definitely
grab
this
one
again
o
uh
just
average
probably
wont
seek
it
out
again
o
the
beer
goes
down
smoothly
and
isnt
that
difficult
to
drink
once
you
get
used
to
the
unusual
combination
of
bread
and
citrus
we
did
a
large
christmas
and
winter
beer
tasting
panel
and
this
was
one
of
the
many
that
we
tried
most
of
the
beers
we
tried
we
solid
including
this
one
that
the
panel
liked
cheers
the
taste
is
interesting
the
scent
carries
over
and
its
a
strong
malty
ale
spciey
to
an
extent
but
dry
so
there
isnt
most
of
a
carryover
of
aftertaste
unique
but
not
a
good
highquantity
beer
this
is
a
nice
sessionable
brew
for
sure
goes
down
real
easy
and
has
a
real
nice
hop
presence
my
first
experience
with
peak
organic
and
i
like
this
one
pours
a
golden
orange
with
a
thin

not
much
retention
but
very
nice

is
of
roasted

carbonation
taste

finish
its

but
i
liked
it
anyway
the
beer
starts
with
a
mouth
full
of
carbonation
the
carbonation
subsides
and
leaves
a
stickiness
on
the
tongue
the
flavor
starts
sweet
and
quickly
becomes
a
mix
of
tart
and
almost
acid
flavor
at
the
very
end
i
get
some
roasted
flavors
mixed
with
the
hop
bitterness
good
mouthfeel
of
caramel
and
cascade
through
and
through
nice
on
the
wallet
whole

found
a
nice
exclusive
contract
on
this
one
methinks
d
medium

a

whos
looking
for
more
than
a

less

not

at
all
this
was
my
second

and
both
have
been
quite
disappointing

the

a

offputting
but
overall
a
pleasant
surprise
d
kind
of
a
winter
beer
for
ca
in
a
way
the
hops
start
to
give
a
pale

feel
making
an
interesting

with
the
wheat
character
full

a
nice
surprise
in

d
not
really
something
i
would
buy
again
but
would
be
a
good
offering
in
a

mild

good
beer
d
this
is
definitely
a
sessionable
beer

verdict
ok
beer
on
being
more
malty
with

i
felt
deceived
by
the
taste
after
high
hopes
with
the

and
appearance
of
it
if
youve
tried
a
beer
that
is
toasty

with

just
didnt

it

grade
b
d
balanced
beer
with
an
easy

profile
nice
for
introduction
of

ales
for
newcomers
to
craft
beer
not
too
assertive
and
easy

the
beer
pours
a

color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to

the
aroma
is

it
has
a
dry
pale
wheat
crystal
malt
scent
along
with
a
nice
bouquet
of
yeast
esters
the
taste
is
decent
it

dry

it
has
a

character
and
some
excellent
yeast
notes
in
the

the
mouthfeel
is
decent
as
well
it
is
a
low
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
very
drinkable
session
ale
its
overly
complex
but
it
does
have
some
interesting
yeast
character
and
a
touch
of
hops
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
but
at
5
abv
this
is
understandable
overall
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
brew
as
i
quite
enjoy
hoppy
wheat
beers
i
enjoy
peak
organic
for
their
simply
but
solid
representations
of
various
styles
and
beers
like
this
might
make
me
consider
them
more
often
a
dark
end
of
10
percent
wheat
and
mostly
earthy
citrus
hops
a
tad
darker
than
amber
with
a
nose
of
pear
and
raspberry
the
beer
is
simply
that
with
a
bitter
finish
not
something
that
you
can
have
more
than
one
of
in
my
sense
of
drinking
one
dimensional
and
simple
but
there
consistent
so
it
could
be
a
beer
to
love
but
is
all
based
on
personal
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
definitely
lives
up
to
the
session
part
of
its
name
as
you
can
enjoy
several
of
these
without
feeling
a
major
buzz
and
i
highly
recommend
this
one
on
a
cold
winter
night
if
youd
like
to
remember
that
warmer
weather
is
just
around
the
corner
i
have
mixed
emotions
about
this
beer
i
tend
to
enjoy
most
winter
style
beers
but
this
one
just
tastes
a
little
off
to
me
a
lot
of
the
organic
style
beers
this
one
included
have
more
of
an
earthy
taste
to
them
in
my
opinion
although
conversely
this
beer
seems
to
lack
in
the
spiciness
that
i
desire
with
a
winter
ale
it
has
a
nice
subtle
caramel
and
roasted
flavor
but
it
just
seems
kind
of
plain
to
me
and
lacks
a
complex
flavor
dynamic
average
carbonation
with
a
decent
head
when
first
poured
not
the
best
winter
beer
ive
had
but
not
the
worst
either
not
a
terrible
beer
on
the
whole
nor
one
ill
go
out
of
my
way
to
try
again
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
drinkability
was
pretty
decent
i
liked
the
sweeter
wheat
and
malty
flavors
it
had
enjoyable
beer
overall
and
a
pretty
decent
winter
seasonal
as
well
the
best
before
date
is
may
2011
so
it
seems
like
something
went
wrong
in
production
and
bottling
i
like
the
idea
and
basis
for
this
beer
that
ill
try
it
again
i
sincerely
hope
it
gets
better
d

this
is

worth
drinking
for
a
long
time
peak
impresses
in
a
usually
unimpressive
style
with
the
light
feel
and
citrus
hops
this
could
do
as
a
spring
beer
as
well
m
d
straightforward
mediumlight
not
quite
enough
substance
to
inspire
drinking
bought
a
six
pack
at

the

of
pine
cloves
citrus
and

light
bread
flavor
with
a

really
clean
finish
and
crisp

this
is
a
very
refreshing
beer
for
me
at
least
the
mouthfeel
is
soft
most
definitely
from
the
wheat
winter
session
is
dark
without
being
roasty
flavorful
easy
drinking
this
one
was
very
smooth
and
great

with
a
very
unique
taste
flat
beer
no
real
tastes
this
one
is
very
um
lets
say
organic
tasting
moreso
thsn
any
of
their
other
brews
o
a
very
straightforward
and
simples
brew
that
is
fairly
decent
extremely
easy
to
drink
like
most
of
uintas
noncrooked

brews
and
could
be
easily
sessioned
nice
for
a
break
beer
every
once
in

poured
from

12
oz
bottle

taste
is
of
mild
lemons
some
spices
a
bit
of
wheat
refreshing
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
good
quality
beer
o
i
like
this
its
complex
enough
to
be
interesting
without
being
overbearing
and
pretentious
its
just
a

this

pretty

clean

balance
and

nothing
that
sets
it

drinkable
for

overall
its

extremely

beer
this
could
be
a

or

brew
either
way
it
could
go
if
pairing
with
food
i
would
recommend
a
wheatbun
burger
to
go
with
it
and
have
a
mildly
spicy
sauce
on
it
flavors
really
open
up
with
that
pairing
overall
the
flavor
profile
has
some
interesting
aspects
to
it
i
however
do
not
approve
of
the
brewers
misrepresentation
of
it
i
would
give
it
a
try
though
if
you
want
something
low
on
taste
on
alcohol
but
isnt
entirely
boring
i
saw
no
reason
to
hold
back
and
went
with
an
aggro
pour
resulting
in
a
dense
foamy
finger
of
lighttan
head
with
good
retention
color
was
a
deep
copperyamber
with
nequality
clarity
nose
had
a
strong
malty
sweetness
slightly
bready
slightly
biscuity
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
a
big
sweet
presence
on
the
tongue
finish
remained
fairly
sweet
and
i
found
myself
thankful
that
i
only
traded
for
one
of
these
it
is
not
that
there
was
anything
intrinsically
wrong
with
it
nor
was
it
out
of
spec
for
the
style
guidelines
as
promulgated
by
this
site
instead
i
just
prefer
something
hoppier
and
when
i
do
not
get
it
i
tend
to
move
on
caveat
emptor
this
is
a
dark
wheat
really
i
get
no
wheat
tones
off
this
it
strikes
me
as
much
more
of
an
amber
than
anything
else
and
a
mild
one
at
that
kind
of
a
boring
beer
i
have
to
say
nothing
really
going
on
flavor
wise
that
holds
my
interest
pours
a
mostly
clear
copper
with
a
chill
haze
aroma
of
orange
citrus
and
some
spicy
notes
in
the
taste
mildly
bitter
citrus
hops
and
a
small
earthy
dry
spice
mild
tangy
sweetness
but
this
beer
is
more
than
bitter
enough
to
balance
out
medium
bodied
and
very
crisp
with
a
small
dry
spice
overall
this
is
a
nice
wheat
ale
well
crafted
and
enjoyable
a
decent
beer
the
flavor
profile
was
pleasant
but
seemed
a
bit
subdued
an
average
but
sessionable
ale
could
be
better
not
very
wheaty
and
the
tartness
doesnt
fit
with
the
rest
of
the
beer
would
probably
pair
with
food
okay
glad
i
tried
it
but
its
pedestrian
o
not
sure
if
age
was
a
factor
here
carbonation
was
as
strong
as
ever
which
hints
otherwise
sweet
with
an
extract
like
twang
boring
nose
and
flavor
wise
cant
see
this
getting
much
better
pass
pours
a
clear
medium
brownamber
color
with
a
perfect
offwhite
head
some
slight
scents
of
wheat
and
malts
but
nothing
overpowering
in
the
smell
taste
is
quite
mellow
and
very
light
you
get
some
hints
of
raw
wheat
but
that
it
is
the
actual
taste
is
fine
there
just
need
to
be
more
flavor
behind
it
overall
a
weak
beer
that
needs
work
but
i
guess
its
all
about
marketing
it
as
a
usda
organic
in
the
end
my
favorite
thing
about
this
beer
is
the
label
showing
hazel
who
looks
pretty
similar
to
sarah
palin
i
chose
this
over
other
options
specifically
so
i
could
give
it
to
the
inlaws
as
a
laugh
o
not
very
impressed
pretty
disappointed
couldnt
find
a
best
by
date
but
im
guessing
its
an
old
bottle
otherwise
its
just
a
very
plain
beer
would
consider
trying
one
more
time
to
put
speculation
to
rest
doesnt
really
intrigue
or
impress
but
it
drinks
easily
and
also
doesnt
have
any
major
flaws
overall
it
is
a
pretty
refreshing
beer
it
just
lacks
some
of
the
substance
o
overall
ok
just
doesnt
really
stand
out
in
any
way
from
other
beers
out
there
flavors
are
a
bit
dull
and
weak
in
intensity
with
a
lifeless
carbonation
drinkable
for
sure
but
nothing
special
about
this
one
bottled
on
121611
interesting
that
the
label
says
it
contains
barley
malt
hops
and
yeast
but
no
mention
of
wheat
malt

solid

by
jackie
os
a
great
beer
but
this
is
one
ba
that
does
not
improve
on
upon
the
original
o
this
is
a
lot
better
than
the
original
beer
this
is
quite
tasty
i
though
a
bourbon
barrel
aged
wheat
beer
was
crazy
it
was
crazy
enough
to
be
delicious
the
bourbon
overpowers
this
one
quite
a
bit
i
really
cant
detect
much
flavor
at
all
from
the
paw
paw
almost
all
bourbon
fine
by
me
but
objectively
not
very
balanced
maybe
it
needs
to
spend
less
time
in
the
barrel
o
a
great
beer
i
applaud
the
creativity
of
the
brewer
to
go
out
on
a
limb
and
barrel
age
this
jackie
os
and
their
creativity
coupled
with
their
love
of
brewing
is
out
of
this
world
if
you
can
get
this
beer
it
is
worth
a
try
maybe
not
for
everyone
but
i
luvd
it
o
this
beer
is
weird
mix
of
a

a

anyhow
this

is

with
moderate
carbonation
chocolate
pumpkin
pie
some
english
porter
characteristics
a
solid
beer
im
drinking
this
out
of
season
because
your
mom
violin
monster
has
a
unique
name
label
art
and
history
but
its
an
awfully
interesting
beer
in
its
own
right
it
perfectly
blends
german
weizenbock
and
american
stout
with
just
a
pinch
of
belgian
dark
ale
to
create
a
supernatural
symphony
of
spicy
and
rich
flavours
its
not
of
this
world
the
2
39
was
well
worth
the
price
of
admission
to
this
concerto
faring
thee
well
now
o
great
addition
to
arbors
lineup
nice
complex
warming
sipper
for
cool
fall
nights
will
surely
have
more
of
this
one
overall
just
an
odd
beer
to
me
that
isnt
delicious
i
love
arbor
brewing
but
i
dont
like
ann
arbors
violin
monster
and
i
dont
think
this
beer
quite
cuts
it
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
beer
was
its
aroma
and
its
taste
which
was
not
too
far
behind
this
beer
is
a
bit
tough
to
summarize
but
it
seems
to
be
a
nice
blend
between
a
roasty
charcoal
stout
and
a
warming
spicy
pumpkin
beer
making
it
perfect
for
the
change
of
seasons
the
aroma
is
wheaty
endlessly
dark
and
sticky
helped
along
by
sweet
esters
dank
fruits
and
a
cooks
cabinet
of
spice
these
all
translate
seamlessly
into
the
flavoring
where
the
heaviness
hits
up
front
blending
and
softening
to
a
sweeter
easier
beer
at
the
end
of
the
sip
the
aftertaste
shows
a
revival
of
the
bitterness
for
a
pleasant
balanced
breath
the
feel
is
thick
and
suits
the
beer
well
this
guy
definitely
took
us
off
our
feet
surprising
us
at
every
turn
although
it
is
still
a
touch
warm
out
now
we
simply
cannot
wait
until
the
breeze
cools
and
we
can
wrap
ourselves
in
blankets
head
out
to
the
porch
with
the
rest
of
the
six
pack
and
watch
the
trees
change
colors
at
dusk
no
malt
no
hop
tastes
metallic
and
thin
would
rather
drink
vb
food
match
lighter
creamier
cheeses
nothing
sharp
might
work
with
this
however
dont
go
wasting
a
chimay
grand
classique
on
this
beer
decent
enough
red
ale
but
not
a
style
i
love
and
doesnt
show
me
anything
new
in
the
style
just
decent
overall
though
this
isnt
great
stuff
for
a
limited
release
beer
they
really
havent
looked
far
beyond
the
realms
of
what
they
usually
do
its
a
typically
matilda
bay
affair
overall
i
like
this
beer
and
this
brewery
one
of
my
favorite
fall
seasonals
of
this
year
il
drink
anything
that
says
mayflower
on
the
label
really
good
nice
and
toasty
with
a
zing
to
it
a
great
october
beer
this
is
not
over
the
top
pumpkin
or
allspice
or
cardamon
worth
a
drink
for
sure
o
frankly
not
what
i
was
expecting
based
on
the
label
that
said
its
not
bad
particularly
if
you
like
the
more
coffeefocused
flavors
i
still
enjoyed
it
somewhat
as
a
dunkel
this
is
quite
good
overall
a
flavorful
nicely
balanced
autumn
brew
it
hit
all
the
flavors
that
i
like
in
an
octoberfest
worth
a
try
drinks
pretty
much
like
an
american
brown
ale
with
a
pretty
large
dose
of
roasted
specialty
grains
also
reminds
me
just
a
bit
of
some
european
dark
ales
im
a
fan
of
mayflower
they
put
out
some
good
stuff
their
porter
is
outstanding
this
is
a
major
misstep
they
should
can
this
next
season
and
develop
a
more
traditional
fall
beer
odi
enjoyed
this
a
bit
berkshires
river
ale
is
an
upgrade
but
this
is
a
perfect
fall
brew
especially
when
you
are
sick
of
all
the
pumpkin
ales
out
there
pretty
drinkable
too
overall
impression
a
very
interesting
dark
wheat
beer
almost
like
a
shwarzbier
or
black
ale
but
doesnt
have
the
malt
to
support
it
the
metallic
finish
i
found
was
very
uncool
though
however
i
am
aging
my
mayflower
imperial
stout
at
the
moment
and
excited
for
this
thanks
larry
a
dark
american
wheat
eh
well
lots
of
creamy
dark
and
toasty
malts
brown
sugar
very
bready
as
well
as
a
yeasty
kick
though
i
do
think
its
lacking
a
lot
of
body
and
doesnt
have
enough
lingering
flavors
in
the
finish
it
seems
like
mayflower
almost
always
gets
soooo
close
to
delivering
solid
takes
on
certain
styles
but
falls
a
little
flat
o
nothing
earth
shattering
a
decent
brew
but
my
least
favorite
mayflower
brew
so
far
o
a
pretty
enjoyable
beer
i
thought
though
i
would
have
preferred
more
of
a
traditional
dunkelweizen
overall
it
is
ok
not
the
most
interesting
o
if
someone
puts
one
in
your
hand
drink
it
there
are
better
fall
offerings
out
there
though
personally
im
eagerly
awaiting
winter
for
mayflowers
oatmeal
stout
which
is
their
best
seasonal
imo
o
i
havent
had
many
in
this
style
but
it
was
enjoyable
i
had
this
last
year
and
was
not
impressed
this
year
it
seems
to
be
much
bolder
and
maltier
much
better
recommended
overall
this
is
quite
good
beer
and
the
rich
spicy
bready
flavors
make
this
a
nice
accompaniment
to
encroaching
fall
weather
the
beer
does
want
for
a
slight
boost
in
sugars
to
further
combat
the
tart
and
sour
flavors
but
even
without
it
id
go
back
for
seconds
d
kind
of
flavorful
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
mild
kick
decent
representation
of
style
everything
ive
had
from
mayflower
so
far
has
been
pretty
solid
but
this
beer
is
mediocre
at
best
overall
there
are
a
couple
things
i
am
not
crazy
about
when
it
comes
to
this
beer
the
first
is
the
bitterness
the
second
is
the
carbonation
however
this
beer
really
mellows
out
and
gets
better
as
it
warms
im
a
fan
of
mayflower
but
this
beer
exceeded
my
expectations
on
a
pretty
gold
fall
night
this
was
a
great
choice
d
goes
down
ok
decent
kick
not
too
filling
ok
representation
of
style
not
a
beer
that
i
would
pick
up
again
but
not
one
that
i
would
turn
away
drinkability
about
as
earthy
a
beer
as
i
have
had
this
one
is
an
aquired
taste
not
sure
if
i
would
get
this
one
again
but
mayflower
should
get
points
for
creativity
drinks
ok
tasty
but
kind
of
confused
no
alcohol
harshness
but
a
bit
of
a
burnt
astringency
throughout
i
dug
this
but
the
unbalanced
edge
to
this
made
me
glad
i
got
just
one
just
ok
but
a
very
nice
different
twist
on
a
dark
wheat
pours
a
nice
dark
brown
color
nice
carbonation
nice
little
fizzy
offwhite
head
with
some
minimal
sticky
lacing
left
behind
the
nose
is
malty
with
some
very
nice
chocolatetoffee
notes
bready
the
taste
is
malty
slightly
sweet
nice
chocolatetoffee
notes
medium
body
drinkable
i
like
this
one
recommended
this
is
not
an
enjoyable
drink
accordingly
headed
to
the
drain
mayflower
is
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
due
to
the
inherent
earthy
flavors
in
all
their
beers
and
this
one
falls
right
in
line
dont
see
this
style
to
often
great
great
campfire
beer
the
drinkability
pretty
good
its
a
pretty
unique
beer
with
some
interesting
things
going
on
but
it
lacks
cohesion
in
my
opinion
i
cant
see
myself
drinking
more
than
a
couple
the
tang
catches
up
with
me
overall
a
good
concept
and
pretty
good
execution
not
very
interesting
to
be
honest
the
beer
is
fairly
medium
bodied
decently
carbonated
and
more
creamy
on
the
tongue
than
not
the
taste
is
a
deal
breaker
it
tastes
like
there
is
rye
and
bittering
spices
which
really
do
nothing
to
endear
me
to
this
beer
the
back
end
is
just
hard
to
take
at
first
i
thought
maybe
there
were
some
bretty
yeasts
going
on
than
maybe
some
spices
maybe
an
odd
variety
of
hop
maybe
some
rye
wheat
im
not
sure
what
is
causing
this
somewhat
harsh
bite
in
the
finish
but
it
isnt
good
the
coarse
wheaty
feel
is
pretty
much
absent
from
the
beer
there
are
plenty
of
slightly
charred
brown
malts
some
crystal
malt
im
sure
but
it
comes
down
to
that
really
harsh
finish
that
just
slays
this
beer
for
the
worse
one
and
done
for
me
flavorful
dark
malts
light
bittering
hops
the
body
is
quite
thin
with
an
average
level
of
carbonation
i
taste
things
similar
to
bark
like
sassafras
this
is
a
dry
beer
with
a
very
short
aftertaste
served
in
a
standard
pint
poured
a
dark
reddishbrown
with
ruby
highlights
around
the
base
head
was
a
half
inch
loose
and
creamcolored
nose
was
malty
with
a
suggestion
of
lactose
taste
consistent
with
nose
toasted
mediumdark
malts
and
a
hint
of
nutmeg
in
the
mix
mouthfeel
was
lightmedium
but
had
a
somewhat
water
consistency
and
carbonation
was
a
bit
fizzy
flavors
seemed
a
little
muddled
for
me
unfortunately
the
whole
package
didnt
really
come
together
in
my
opinion
clear
dark
brown
with
a
reddish
hue
more
coppery
than
chestnut
in
tint
the
fizzy
beige
cap
fell
quickly
to
a
collar
which
clung
to
the
glass
and
left
some
shortlived
spotty
lace
behind
the
aroma
was
sweet
with
dark
earthy
malts
caramel
and
bread
crust
and
dried
fruits
raisins
mostly
but
a
bit
of
fresh
plum
as
well
slightly
spicy
balanced
up
front
herbal
bitterness
and
bready
malt
caramel
ripe
plums
as
the
malt
faded
the
bitterness
really
took
over
lingering
long
into
the
finish
it
was
much
harder
to
pick
out
any
spicy
character
in
the
flavour
but
it
was
there
towards
the
end
once
the
beer
warmed
up
a
bit
medium
bodied
with
low
carbonation
palate
coating
with
light
astringency
quite
smooth
in
texture
an
interesting
beer
overall
i
enjoyed
it
from
start
to
finish
the
finish
comes
mostly
dry
with
a
little
lingering
sweet
syrupy
flavor
remnants
some
bitterness
comes
through
as
well
but
just
a
little
more
of
the
minerality
flavors
and
more
diacetyl
a
slight
dark
wheat
and
bock
flavor
still
and
hints
of
dark
malts
again
it
gets
very
sticky
and
flemmy
with
the
sticky
flavors
and
dry
feel
combined
this
is
a
very
dark
reddish
brown
brew
with
nice
carbonation
out
of
the
bottle
roasty
aroma
flavor
is
not
like
your
typical
dunkelweizen
american
yeasts
apparently
flavor
is
quite
roasty
almost
a
bit
smoky
kind
of
like
a
pseudoporter
or
deep
brown
ale
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
it
finishes
with
roastybread
notes
very
drinkable
NA
to
be
fair
ill
try
this
again
with
a
cheese
plate
though
it
probably
wont
be
this
winter
i
enjoy
franconias
other
offerings
just
not
this
one
this
was
my
least
favorite
at
this
brewery
i
want
to
be
a
fan
of
every
beer
from
this
brewery
my
heart
is
open
so
to
speak
thats
probably
why
i
was
so
disappointed
franconia
can
do
better
than
this
and
in
a
years
time
ill
revisit
this
beer
to
see
if
any
improvements
were
made
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
brown
color
with
a
creamcolored
head
the
aroma
is
heavy
on
the
wheat
toffee
and
banana
the
flavor
is
similar
with
a
few
added
notes
i
get
a
lot
of
wheat
toffee
caramel
and
banana
but
i
also
get
some
cinnamon
and
cloves
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
one
of
the
better
franconia
beers
this
is
a
very
flavourful
beer
very
few
foods
can
compete
with
the
strength
of
the
flavour
and
perhaps
its
just
the
moment
but
its
hard
to
imagine
enjoying
this
beer
as
anything
more
than
a
novelty
i
am
quite
a
fan
of
franconia
and
their
adherence
to
the
german
purity
laws
but
honestly
this
bee
is
a
bit
much
a
little
to
much
of
summer
in
my
winter
good
beer
overall
this
was
kind
of
a
sour
beer
too
much
of
a
wheat
like
taste
for
me
as
well
nice
light
winter
spiciness
that
might
be
from
spice
addition
hops
or
wheat
i
like
that
its
not
overthetop
like
many
wintery
ales
nice
wheat
flavor
nice
smooth
creaminess
pretty
good
drinkability
drink
this
one
just
wasnt
for
me
probably
wont
come
back
to
this
the
beer
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
has
some
grass
and
toffee
but
not
too
much
else
the
flavor
is
a
little
more
complex
i
get
some
sugar
and
honey
notes
as
well
as
some
grass
and
toffee
the
beer
is
fairly
sweet
overall
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
this
is
certainly
an
interesting
take
on
the
style
with
the
honey
and
light
tartness
adding
something
different
decent
stuff
lots
of
bubblegum
sweet
candy
and
a
yeasty
wheat
tang
decent
hoppy
bitterness
on
the
finish
toasted
malt
is
an
odd
but
tasty
addition
to
the
flavor
profile
wouldnt
mind
a
bit
more
creamy
body
but
overall
i
am
very
happy
with
this
beer
will
have
no
problem
polishing
this
bomber
off
by
myself
gets
better
as
the
bottle
goes
along
and
is
downright
tasty
as
fuck
the
last
glass
or
two
let
this
one
warm
up
to
around
5055
before
drinking
many
thanks
go
out
to
daniel
aka
stopbarking
for
sending
me
this
new
one
from
freetail
the
beer
pours
out
a
nice
hazy
ruby
color
with
a
very
healthy
amount
of
frothy
white
heading
nose
has
some
fresh
grains
mainly
the
vienna
malt
poking
through
a
bit
of
citrus
fruit
not
much
on
the
wheat
end
more
of
the
same
flavor
wise
with
the
rye
coming
through
well
it
says
on
their
site
that
there
is
texas
brush
fire
honey
here
too
which
i
suppose
i
get
a
hint
of
the
mouthfeel
leaves
a
bit
to
be
desired
in
that
it
is
pretty
thin
and
watery
the
drinkability
is
not
bad
with
a
decent
amount
of
flavor
keeping
things
interesting
in
the
long
run
overall
this
brew
is
halfway
decent
but
nothing
that
i
would
look
to
try
again
they
definitely
get
a
nod
from
me
for
doing
so
much
experimenting
though
cheers
another
interesting
beer
from
freetail
i
enjoy
it
but
it
does
not
rank
up
with
their
best
very
much
worth
a
try
though
t
absolute
taste
explosion
smooth
wheat
combined
with
hints
of
caramel
and
malts
so
many
tastes
going
on
at
once
great
combo
of
wheat
caramel
and
malts
ontap
at
flying
saucer
in
raleigh
served
a
crisp
brown
with
a
decent
khaki
head
that
slowly
diminishes
to
a
ring
but
leaves
great
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
is
some
dark
malts
and
wheat
the
taste
is
an
interesting
amount
of
dried
fruits
and
dark
malts
with
mild
spice
almost
like
a
light
weizenbock
the
beer
is
on
the
light
side
of
medium
with
decent
coronation
this
is
certainly
a
unique
beer
one
worthy
of
celebrating
the
15th
anniversary
of
my
favorite
beer
bar
chain
on
tap
tonight
at
the
breckenridge
barbeque
spot
on
kalamath
our
server
told
us
it
was
brewed
for
a
restaurant
back
in
texas
or
tennesee
he
wasnt
sure
and
that
they
threw
it
on
tap
a
pretty
decent
wheat
beer
all
around
if
you
are
not
really
looking
for
a
wheat
beer
somewhat
sweet
with
a
little
cherry
a
little
caramel
and
maybe
some
spiciness
from
the
wheat
refreshing
and
drinkable
d
this
is
a
nice
session
beer
the
wheat
seems
more
like
a
lightener
rather
than
a
contributor
to
the
flavor
overall
a
pretty
decent
beer
NA
NA
poured
a
bottle
obtained
from
a
pick
6
craft
beer
wall
into
a
weizen
glass
a
nice
looking
brew
dark
reddish
bronze
with
around
two
inches
of
light
khaki
colored
foam
smells
like
classic
grainy
wheat
spice
cereals
with
hints
of
caramel
grassy
hop
and
fruity
ale
yeast
esters
unless
the
particular
example
is
wellhopped
i
find
it
hard
to
detect
much
aroma
in
this
style
on
the
palate
i
get
a
strong
wheat
flavor
coupled
with
nuts
and
delicate
brown
sugar
along
with
more
vague
fruitiness
a
tad
syrupy
yet
somehow
watery
as
well
difficult
to
describe
this
seeming
paradox
likely
a
diacetyl
byproduct
almost
a
buttered
bread
effect
going
on
here
aggressive
carbonation
that
lifts
up
the
wheat
husk
and
spice
someone
below
compared
this
favorably
to
grasshopper
and
i
echo
that
sentiment
a
decent
showcase
for
rather
unadulterated
lightly
toasted
wheat
flavor
d
an
amalgam
of
styles
a
mix
of
english
us
pale
and
a
us
dark
kristal
wheat
us
pub
pale
grain
bill
with
both
us
and
english
hops
us
overall
but
with
noticeable
diacetyl
noticeable
wheat
base
a
bit
different
without
expecting
it
tasty
drinkable
though
overall
a
great
dark
wheat
ale
by
wild
rose
almost
sits
on
the
border
of
being
a
wheat
aleredamber
ale
hybrid
great
flavours
for
those
who
enjoy
caramel
and
bready
flavours
d
i
fail
to
see
a
difference
between
this
and
any
other
boring
dark
lager
out
there
and
i
dont
see
much
of
a
point
in
having
a
style
dedicated
to
this
type
of
beer
if
they
all
taste
this
boring
call
a
spade
a
spade
this
is
a
dark
lager
and
not
a
good
one
at
that
an
ok
beer
but
nowhere
near
some
of
wild
roses
better
offerings
not
sure
how
ive
never
tried
this
one
before
o
this
review
was
more
difficult
than
i
anticipated
it
would
be
this
beer
doesnt
stand
out
and
unfortunately
i
think
its
wild
roses
weak
point
so
far
i
would
still
drink
it
again
but
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
buy
it
i
prefer
rickards
red
to
this
as
far
as
a
red
goes
not
offensive
just
not
my
favorite
is
all
and
i
think
it
could
be
improved
on
another
thumbs
up
for
wild
rose
this
is
much
better
than
grasshopper
which
is
its
logical
competitor
as
the
only
other
albertan
pale
wheat
ale
i
can
think
of
im
not
sure
its
really
all
that
pale
though
theres
nothing
stunning
here
but
its
still
a
refreshing
somewhat
novel
example
of
the
style
drinkability
good
and
refreshing
one
of
the
better
offerings
from
these
guys
d
a
tasty
and
unique
offering
again
not
a
favourite
of
mine
from
wild
rose
but
i
would
never
turn
one
down
its
easily
drinkable
but
the
overwhelming
wheat
flavours
are
a
bit
of
a
turnoff
would
like
to
try
this
one
on
tap
to
see
if
the
flavours
come
through
differently
d
everything
about
this
beer
is
a
little
better
than
the
average
wheat
ale
nothing
special
but
is
non
the
less
enjoyable
really
forgettable
poured
a
clear
reddish
brown
with
a
two
finger
frothy
cream
coloured
head
the
head
diminished
to
a
ring
but
the
thin
lacing
persisted
mild
bread
yeast
smells
slight
esters
taste
was
bready
malts
with
a
slightly
metallic
hop
finish
mouthfeel
was
light
in
body
lightly
carbonated
drinkability
was
pretty
good
a
worthy
beer
i
hope
to
try
it
on
tap
soon
a
rather
unusual
malty
wheat
a
couple
of
bottles
in
the
six
were
not
properly
carbonated
probably
a
sealing
problem
a
pleasant
enough
bolstered
wheat
ale
i
could
see
having
a
few
of
these
on
the
patio
once
this
bloody
alberta
weather
smartens
up
not
a
lot
of
examples
of
this
blending
of
styles
out
there
on
the
market
so
best
you
try
it
from
these
guys
a
medium
bodied
ale
with
good
mouth
feel
not
overly
sweet
as
some
red
and
amber
ales
tend
to
be
it
has
some
minor
floral
flavors
and
hints
of
brown
sugar
and
vanilla
hops
are
well
balanced
and
evident
in
the
finish
this
is
the
kind
of
beer
i
could
drink
every
day
really
nice
during
the
summer
with
some
ribs
or
steak
on
the
grill
with
fish
and
chips
or
some
nice
salty
appetizers
easily
beats
anything
in
its
class
as
far
as
canadian
red
ales
available
in
alberta
are
concerned
good
job
wr
good
job
poured
with
a
spare
offwhite
head
that
quickly
diminished
to
almost
nothing
body
was
ambercolored
and
slightly
hazy
aroma
was
of
light
wheat
some
slight
malt
in
there
as
well
mediumbodied
on
the
palate
thintextured
yet
slightly
oily
average
carbonation
and
a
slightly
bitter
finish
tasted
lightly
sweet
and
wheaty
in
the
beginning
but
finished
with
a
very
low
bitter
taste
interesting
overall
i
liked
what
theyve
tried
to
do
here
and
i
feel
theyve
succeeded
more
than
theyve
failed
id
definitely
have
it
again
thanks
to
alex
voonder
for
the
bottle
bottle
poured
a
clear
light
brown
color
ale
with
a
medium
foamy
head
with
average
retention
and
minimal
lacing
aroma
of
wheat
with
some
dry
caramel
malt
is
somewhat
interesting
taste
is
also
a
nice
mix
between
some
wheat
malt
with
light
cloves
ester
and
some
dry
caramel
malt
very
refreshing
with
good
carbonation
and
average
body
wild
rose
has
shown
us
that
theyre
capable
of
so
much
more
their
imperial
ipa
was
nothing
short
of
fantastic
so
why
are
their
regularly
bottled
offerings
so
bland
its
almost
as
though
albertas
brewers
all
have
the
idea
that
albertans
are
roughhewn
sons
of
the
soil
that
view
any
kind
of
flamboyance
in
a
beer
as
suspect
that
may
be
true
in
the
main
but
theres
a
growing
number
of
drinkers
looking
for
something
a
little
wilder
served
with
a
small
creamy
white
head
the
body
is
a
deep
nutty
transluscent
amber
in
appearance
sweet
yet
tart
aroma
caramel
malt
with
a
bit
of
husky
wheat
grain
robust
nutty
and
toffee
malts
up
front
in
the
flavour
some
sharp
wheat
in
the
middle
along
with
mild
coffee
notes
on
the
finish
accompanied
by
dandelionlike
hops
mediumbodied
mouthfeel
this
is
a
surprisingly
savoury
and
malty
wheat
ale
nothing
like
i
was
expecting
but
in
the
end
it
makes
for
a
great
sessional
note
to
self
ranked
11
american
dark
wheat
ale
when
i
tried
it
but
it
is
a
really
short
list
this
isnt
a
hefe
in
the
true
sense
of
the
word
thats
for
sure
putting
style
aside
however
cutting
the
carbonation
would
measurably
improve
things
and
bump
up
its
drinkability
as
it
is
its
subtlyflavoured
brew
that
i
havent
minded
taking
home
ontap
at
the
brewery
revived
after
several
years
reddish
with
a
small
crown
more
a
wheat
and
little
characterstic
of
a
hefe
as
wattery
and
maltycaramel
but
not
overally
sweet
not
shaken
up
creaminess
more
of
an
allmalt
lager
slash
cream
ale
above
average
carbonation
verdict
one
of
the
better
beers
in
the
wheatamber
ale
category
ive
tried
to
date
its
soft
smooth
rustic
and
more
importantly
its
very
easy
to
drink
this
really
hit
the
spot
on
a
cool
fall
day
this
is
a
beer
outside
the
boxes
an
awesome
standby
thats
always
available
from
this
brewery
one
of
the
reasons
im
a
true
gb
fanboy
wonderful
next
to
a
bowl
of
red
chili
o
this
beer
is
interesting
it
has
a
nice
smoke
flavor
but
it
starts
to
take
over
all
the
other
flavors
and
gets
a
bit
tough
to
finish
the
whole
glass
o
i
was
hoping
for
something
a
little
more
left
field
o
lots
of
promises
but
in
total
a
subpar
beer
overall
a
nice
beer
would
drink
again
o
a
nice
refreshing
beer
a
bit
thin
in
body
but
it
has
good
flavor
a
great
deproef
style
primitive
but
an
american
wheat
and
completely
without
category
pour
is
dark
orange
amber
with
a
smaller
white
head
nose
of
funk
that
im
associating
with
curdling
honey
palate
is
that
a
floral
note
of
funk
mild
carbination
hint
of
bitter
orange
peel
but
not
bittering
finish
is
brisk
pollen
and
plum
broad
drink
for
abv
fantastic
for
lamb
parsley
and
brie
drunk
on
a
picnic
at
a
layby
in
brittany
france
and
poured
into
a
plastic
cup
the
beer
is
a
warm
amber
color
with
a
tight
head
of
buffcolored
bubbles
sweet
malt
dominates
the
nose
think
digestive
crackers
the
flavor
is
also
dominated
by
rich
bready
malt
which
is
joined
by
warming
alcohol
in
the
finish
gwiniz
du
paired
nicely
with
a
babybel
cheese
and
an
apple
mehhhh
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
something
i
want
to
revisit
any
time
soon
drinkability
no
problem
its
here
then
gone
easy
to
drink
just
not
sure
i
want
to
drink
another
not
sure
i
dont
though
either
im
a
bit
ambivalent
easy
drinking
more
like
a
belgian
wit
or
bells
oberon
than
the
other
blé
noir
beers
of
brittany
drinkability
a
good
beer
in
the
style
buckwheat
beer
brewered
by
britt
in
britany
france
taste
was
fruity
of
red
fruit
the
dark
wheat
give
the
beer
a
nice
roasted
grainy
wheat
taste
and
really
adds
to
the
overall
complexity
some
caramel
which
gave
the
beer
its
body
and
chewiness
there
is
some
bitterness
which
goes
well
with
the
style
body
is
medium
and
drinkability
is
ok
pleasant
beer
very
drinkable
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
recommended
deep
orangey
copper
body
with
no
head
but
intense
carbonation
light
malty
aroma
with
licorice
and
dark
fruits
the
flavors
come
out
rather
strong
at
first
but
they
just
dont
carry
in
the
finish
that
is
particularly
watery
while
being
slightly
tart
in
the
middle
theres
a
big
sugary
and
peppery
rye
and
acid
fruits
aspect
but
the
shortness
kills
it
a
bit
too
candyish
but
i
like
its
differences
if
only
it
had
a
bit
more
lenght
a
nice
and
fine
white
collar
on
a
dark
purple
mahogany
color
body
its
a
buckwheat
beer
and
therefore
smells
like
buckwheat
the
smell
is
dry
and
salty
the
taste
is
very
refined
and
enjoyable
dark
malts
create
a
nut
and
even
chestnut
flavor
some
winy
aspects
wooden
red
fruits
flavor
with
the
nut
or
chestnut
aspect
remaining
longer
in
the
aftertaste
very
light
hints
of
caramel
and
coffee
nice
notes
of
smoke
mouthfeel
is
so
smooth
and
creamy
a
great
beer
NA
NA
pours
a
deep
mahogany
in
color
with
some
reddish
highlights
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
some
spotty
lacing
is
seen
when
sipped
the
aroma
is
light
but
is
of
dark
bread
with
some
malts
and
nuts
pretty
much
the
same
for
the
taste
with
a
slightly
bitter
finish
for
the
black
walnuts
and
much
stronger
than
the
aroma
suggests
not
your
average
wheat
beer
taste
very
smooth
and
is
a
good
tasting
brew
between
lighter
and
medium
bodied
with
perfect
carbonation
rjt
o
a
very
solid
drinkable
beer
love
the
flavor
my
first
walnut
beer
was
impressed
with
my
first
beer
from
this
brewery
cant
wait
to
try
others

of
pale

hint
of

and
slight

fits
the
style

crisp
with

overall
weak

and
lacking

but
good
aroma
and
body
overall
good
solid
wheat
really
drinkable
on
a
brisk
day
like
today
worth
a
try
would
get
multiple
rounds
super
drinkability
a
whole
lot
of
flavor
in
a
sessionable
ale
if
nothing
else
it
is
interesting
with
the
walnuts
and
the
taste
of
root
beer
okay
i
expected
this
to
be
a
gimmick
sweet
artificial
all
sorts
of
bad
i
am
happy
to
be
wrong
on
all
counts
this
is
well
done
nutty
well
balanced
and
just
plain
good
i
have
absolutely
no
idea
how
readily
available
this
is
but
if
you
see
it
try
it
o
this
is
really
good
i
was
surprised
by
the
use
of
black
walnuts
nice
dark
wheat
beer
i
had
this
at
a
festival
at
the
public
house
in
rolla
there
were
a
lot
of
great
beers
there
but
by
far
this
was
my
favorite
it
is
not
what
you
expect
form
the
name
and
that
was
the
intention
of
the
brewer
it
was
a
little
bit
darker
than
most
american
wheats
but
i
was
reluctant
to
call
it
a
dark
wheat
it
pours
with
moderate
head
and
lacing
an
awesome
aroma
of
wheat
malt
and
berries
are
appearent
before
you
even
it
get
it
close
to
your
nose
it
has
peppery
and
berry
like
taste
produced
by
the
walnuts
that
is
unlike
anything
i
have
ever
tasted
there
are
not
much
for
nut
esters
mainly
berries
and
some
clove
it
has
some
bit
to
the
body
but
is
mainly
very
smooth
it
is
a
great
late
summer
early
fall
beer
overall
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
as
this
is
among
a
small
handful
of
styles
ive
never
tried
interesting
beer
that
im
glad
i
forgot
about
actually
as
it
makes
a
great
transition
towards
tryingtobespring
in
the
upper
midwest
i
hope
they
bring
this
one
back
next
year
poured
this
into
a
weizen
glass
and
boy
does
it
look
good
solid
black
brown
the
color
of
dark
chocolate
or
french
toast
coffee
beans
with
a
creamy
cap
of
cocoa
colored
foam
this
is
a
showcase
for
malt
all
the
way
aroma
has
caramel
and
chocolate
notes
along
with
a
light
chocolate
covered
banana
note
its
sweet
without
being
cloying
pleasing
chocolate
malts
and
a
touch
of
banana
overall
unique
beer
i
like
most
reviewers
did
not
know
what
to
expect
from
a
dark
wheat
this
was
above
and
beyond
a
pleasant
surprise
bottle
at
port
street
love
the
roast
flavour
first
of
the
style
wont
be
the
last
wait
a
winter
seasonal
from
anchor
that
isnt
their
annual
christmas
beer
hmmm
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
dark
blackbrown
topped
by
nearly
two
fingers
of
tan
foam
the
nose
comprises
mild
roasted
malts
toasted
wheat
light
vinyl
and
a
vague
melange
of
spices
pervading
the
background
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
along
with
a
hint
of
toasted
marshmallow
and
an
increasingly
strong
vein
of
anise
the
body
is
a
lightleaning
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
fluid
feel
overall
this
wasnt
too
bad
a
beer
but
that
anise
character
ends
up
tanking
things
a
bit
for
me
to
the
point
that
ill
likely
never
look
for
this
stuff
again
shame
cause
without
that
bit
of
unpleasantness
this
beer
likely
would
have
been
pretty
good
dark
and
roastynot
the
wheat
beer
youre
expecting
a
great
and
unique
addition
to
the
anchor
linenot
as
remarkably
good
as
their
porter
but
more
so
than
steam
which
is
already
pretty
darn
good
see
jeffreysans
review
for
absolutely
spoton
details
i
will
now
be
watching
out
for
that
flavor
of
bandaids
in
every
wheat
i
try
flavor
is
equally
sweet
chocolatey
throughout
with
underpinnings
of
dark
cherries
leading
to
a
roasty
toasty
dry
and
lightly
bitter
coffee
finish
very
complex
malt
profile
its
a
touch
too
burnt
for
my
liking
the
fruity
character
becomes
cough
syrupy
as
it
warms
its
anchor
it
is
an
impeccably
made
beer
its
7
abv
but
drinks
like
a
black
lager
its
not
knocking
my
sox
off
but
i
like
it
o
very
interesting
wheat
beer
with
pronounced
roasted
flavors
but
still
easy
to
drink
alcohol
is
well
hidden
and
this
is
an
enjoyable
brew
i
would
get
this
again
wheaty
lightly
roasty
and
smooth
this
beer
is
hurt
pretty
badly
in
my
opinion
by
the
very
strong
smell
which
is
almost
overpowering
to
me
overall
my
first
dark
wheat
ale
pretty
good
o
interesting
pretty
good
but
not
im
not
loving
the
finish
or
aftertaste
great
wheat
flavor
with
a
nice
sweet
fruitiness
and
an
awesome
mouthfeel
i
probably
wouldnt
drink
again
though
overall
this
is
another
excellent
beer
by
anchor
but
one
that
is
completely
surprising
as
it
looks
smells
and
tastes
more
like
an
oatmeal
stout
than
wheat
beer
i
loved
it
and
ill
certainly
get
it
again
cheers
nice
deep
color
with
a
small
light
tan
head
and
pretty
decent
lacing
a
different
type
of
wheat
dark
malty
it
is
ok
but
i
think
i
will
stick
with
the
traditional
wheats
with
more
fruit
and
lightness
pours
a
deep
brown

3
fingers
of

that
leaves
a

a

taste
is
a

version
of
the

with

wheat
haydry

cherry
dark

being
more

more

some

maybe
a

comes
through
finishes
dry
earthy
with
heavy
roast
bittersweet

over
to
dominate
the
dry

with

carbonation
creamy
silky
and
pretty
smooth
dry
especially
in
the
latter
half
of
the
sip
unique
very
nice
really
good
so
far
too
best
beer
ive
tried
from
anchor
overall
a
very
pleasant
rich
dark
wheat
beer
disguised
as
a
porter
refreshing
and
warming
at
the
same
time
if
not
terribly
complex
its
a
very
wellrounded
beer
with
no
weak
spots
dont
understand
the
lower
ratings
i
like
the
toffee
roasted
sweet
chocolate
notes
without
a
bitter

faint

i
like
it
to
be
honest
i
like
it
but
ill
be
revisiting
this
one
to
get
the
true
hang
of
it
rarely
do
i
get
to
have
any
new
beer
from
anchor
so
when
i
see
one
i
usually
buy
it
this
is
a
different
take
on
the
winter
wheat
not
spiced
or
overly
sweet
with
things
like
honey
and
molasses
its
got
a
nice
ruby
dark
color
brownish
red
with
a
tall
tan
head
very
creamy
looking
and
comprised
of
a
billion
tiny
micro
bubbles
the
nose
has
a
cool
fruitiness
to
it
but
it
seems
thin
and
one
dimensional
dried
cherry
or
cranberry
is
what
i
mostly
smell
and
a
little
sweet
caramel
malt
the
flavor
is
better
than
the
smell
with
a
pretty
nuanced
and
layered
grain
complexion
the
dark
wheat
is
soft
in
feel
but
boldly
flavored
and
carries
that
dried
fruit
thing
well
there
is
a
little
cereal
element
a
moderate
toast
component
and
even
a
kiss
of
chocolate
type
malt
in
here
to
make
it
a
little
more
wintery
i
like
that
it
doesnt
feel
spiced
maybe
a
hint
of
some
mulling
spices
but
its
all
in
my
head
not
on
my
tongue
which
is
where
i
am
liking
it
these
days
not
sure
how
many
of
them
i
would
want
to
drink
and
i
found
the
body
a
little
thin
for
the
season
but
its
a
cool
brew
definitely
worth
trying
at
least
a
glass
of
because
its
pretty
different
from
others
on
the
market
very
dark
beer
almost
looks
like
a
stout
with
a
nice
khaki
head
the
beer
looks
verry
nice
the
aroma
is
of
chocolatemolassesvanillablack
licorice
and
the
taste
is
about
the
same
but
it
taste
overly
sweet
like
a
glass
full
of
chocolate
chips
i
could
not
finish
the
beer
had
to
give
to
a
friend
overall
i
was
not
impressed
worst
beer
i
have
had
from
anchor
black
in
color
and
impenetrable
to
light
this
is
a
wheat
beer
a
quarter
inch
of
beige

is
visible
and
leaves

i
smell
dark
wheat
and
some
toffee
notes
i
taste

good

is

its
no
stunner
but
its
another
reason
not
to
discount
anchor
roasty
and
smooth
but
lighter
bodied
than
most
winter
seasonals
very
enjoyable
overall
a
nicely
drinkable
beer
that
provides
some
refreshment

with
the
flavors

very
good
i
dont
have
a
lot
to
say
about
this
beer
it
doesnt
really
need
to
be
dissected
or
explained
in
detail
its
not
that
complicated
it
follows
along
the
anchor
guidelines
as
being
very
clean
and
neatly
structured
its
fruity
a
touch
chocolatey
subtly
roasty
and
wheaty
it
reminds
me
of
cold
sweet
black
coffee
with
some
fruit
juice
added
in
cherry
strawberry
perhaps
just
a
little
fig
yes
its
well
balanced
between
each
of
its
components
lets
not
forget
the
moderate
bitterness
and
its
superbly
polished
i
dont
think
anyone
will
be
wowed
by
this
but
like
all
of
the
anchor
beers
its
a
solid
hitter
that
you
can
put
anywhere
in
the
lineup
and
youll
still
come
home
a
winner
overall
drinkability
well
this
is
the
first
time
ive
had
an
american
dark
wheat
ale
and
from
what
i
see
of
the
ba
description
of
this
style
this
beer
doesnt
quite
fit
it
does
however
come
across
as
a
stout
and
if
i
look
at
it
that
way
a
stout
with
a
wheat
base
its
pretty
good
im
glad
i
got
a
six
pack
so
i
can
explore
this
one
a
bit
more
i
dont
think
i
would
want
more
than
one
a
night
but
its
still
a
good
beer
what
a
compliment
to
anchors
our
special
ale
whichever
winter
ale
you
choose
from
anchor
it
is
sure
to
make
your
holiday
merrier
the
alcohol
was
here
but
i
could
hardly
detect
it
and
it
emerged
as
a
nice
waring
sensation
as
i
worked
my
way
through
this
the
rings
of
lacing
on
the
back
of
my
pint
glass
was
the
icing
on
the
cake
as
this
beer
felt
wonderful
from
start
to
finish
as
far
as
seasonal
beers
go
this
one
deserves
to
be
put
in
anyones
rotation
especially
as
an
alternate
to
the
stronger
and
spicier
offerings
on
the
shelf
this
time
of
the
year
a
wellbalanced
beer
that
went
down
easily
and
is
good
enough
to
be
enjoyed
long
after
the
presents
are
opened
and
the
lights
are
taken
down
o
to
me
this
is
anchors
robust
porter
to
their
yearround
porter
as
a
brown
porter
theres
more
roasted
character
in
this
beer
than
in
the
standard
porter
more
dark
fruit
character
than
chocolate
i
get
from
the
standard
a
very
nice
beer
for
winter
that
hides
its
strength
very
well
o
not
your
usual
winter
read
holiday
spicing
ale
nor
a
typical
wheat
beer
pale
but
a
unique
dark
brew
that
should
be
great
year
around
very
nice
flavor
and
balance
overall
very
good
rjt
o
absolutely
delicious
complex
yet
incredibly
drinkable
a
unique
winter
warmer
offering
from
a
great
brewery
was
looking
forward
to
trying
this
one
a
dark
wheat
sounds
delicious
this
did
not
fail
great
malty
flavor
right
in
your
face
you
get
the
wheat
but
the
malt
runs
over
it
a
bit
seems
like
a
little
of
the
dark
fruit
like
a
dark
belgian
and
even
a
little
roast
and
chocolate
excellent
creamy
feel
made
this
really
enjoyable
the
only
thing
that
kept
it
down
was
a
little
something
funky
at
the
very
end
that
lingered
but
i
could
not
put
my
finger
on
it
overall
a
pretty
solid
twist
on
a
dunkelweizen
style

mix
of

a

i
like
anchor
beers
but
this
one
took
me
by
surprise
on
how
good
it
is
i
may
have
to
make
this
and
osa
annual
beers
serving
type
bottle
osolid
offering
nothing
i
would
seek
out
but
a
quality
beer
would
love
to
see
this
modified
into
more
of
a
german
style
dunkelwiese
with
the
traditional
phenols
etc
tastes
quite
good
pronouncedly
different
from
dunkels
but
still
immediately
recognizable
as
a
strong
dark
wheat
starts
off
toasty
with
very
light
nodes
of
chocolate
and
white
pepper
this
moves
into
a
dryer
more
chocolatey
middle
and
ends
on
a
nice
combo
of
wheatmalt
and
american
yeast
poured
into
a
celebrator
pokal
pours
a
surprisingly
dark
mahogany
brown
appearing
nearly
opaque
in
the
glass
with
a
fine
one
finger
light
brown
head
with
good
retention
and
lacing
aroma
of
light
caramel
malt
and
a
hint
of
chocolate
flavor
is
toasted
malt
wheat
chocolate
and
a
hint
of
toffee
medium
bodied
quite
a
surprise
and
not
what
i
expected
from
this
beer
or
style
the
profile
is
almost
more
like
a
light
porter
than
a
dunkle
weizen
which
is
apparently
the
origin
of
this
american
style
not
quite
to
style
but
nicely
balanced
and
flavorful
an
interesing
flavor
departure
for
anchor
and
one
that
i
applaud
i
liked
this
quite
a
bit
besides
the
almost
nonexistent
aroma
this
is
a
nice
drink
overall
one
of
my
favorite
styles
this
one
delivers
loads
of
chocolate
and
the
7
abv
never
emerges
very
easy
to
down
this
which
i
had
more
anchors
winter
wheat
brew
reveals
the
dark
side
of
wheat
a
nice
change
from
the
light
summer
time
wheat
beers
were
used
to
chocolate
and
toffee
flavors
with
a
mildly
alcoholic
aftertaste
great
beer
overall
very
good
beer
lots
of
chocolate
and
coffee
the
wheat
mixes
well
with
the
coffee
flavors
this
beer
features
more
coffee
bitterness
than
sweet
chocolate
but
both
are
there
a
wonderfully
made
rich
dark
wheat
ale
sweet
and
roasty
with
a
hint
of
balancing
tang
a
great
strong
dark
sipper

a

overall
i
wish
i
got
the
speedway
stout
instead
not
great
not
terrible
that
said
as
i
drink
through
this
it
just
gets
worse
i
really
expected
more
from
this
on
paper
this
combination
should
be
delicious
convenient
distraction
by
oso
is
a
great
example
of
how
coffeevanillacocoa
play
very
well
together
but
this
is
not
anywhere
close
to
being
in
that
league
pours
to
a
deep
reddishbrown
head
is
offwhite
and
dissipates
quickly
leaving
light
lacing
the
aroma
is
a
little
corny
but
otherwise
decent
mild
flavors
the
dark
grain
flavors
really
overpower
any
wheat
taste
you
might
get
usually
wheat
has
a
sweet
spicy
flavor
but
this
drinks
more
like
leinenkugels
snowdrift
vanilla
porter
than
a
wheat
ale
the
carbonation
is
almost
perfect
while
the
flavors
hit
the
palette
rather
mildly
this
is
better
than
i
was
expecting
the
price
wasnt
too
bad
either

good
entry
for
those
looking
to
try
their

black
beer
o
very
easy
to
drink
with
or
without
food
not
as
heavy
as
most
darker
beers
could
drink
several
of
these
which
is
generally
not
the
case
with
darker
beers
due
to
their
heaviness
this
is
a
dark
ale
that
my
wife
actually
enjoys
and
she
does
not
like
darker
beers
o
i
would
definitely
bring
a
6pack
of
this
to
a
party
i
believe
beer
connoisseurs
will
appreciate
this
beer
along
with
your
mgd
miller
coors
friends
decent
craft
beer
that
i
believe
would
appeal
to
many
tastes
this
pours
a
dark
brownblack
color
with
a
slight
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
slightly
robust
with
burnt
starches
and
molasses
the
taste
is
fairly
heavy
and
complex
there
is
a
lot
of
roasted
flavor
mixed
with
some
coffee
a
slightly
bitter
hop
finish
pretty
decent
brew
for
being
a
newer
brewery
beer
is
mediumlight
in

with

would
probably
benefit
the
beer
closes
dry
with
low
to
moderate
stickiness
clinging
to
the
palate
pours
a
clear
dark
brown
with
a
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
tiny
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
roasted
malt
wheat
cocoa
and
slight
char
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
char
and
cocoa
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
roast
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
has
a
slightly
better
taste
in
my
opinion
o
a
good
beer
not
a
fan
of
wheats
but
the
roast
quality
add
a
dimension
i
like
im
glad
i
got
to
try
this
it
took
me
three
of
their
beers
before
3
sheeps
gave
me
some
sort
of
ovine
pun
disappointed
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
deep
midnight
sienna
topped
by
a
finger
of
relatively
shortlived
khaki
foam
the
nose
comprises
coffee
light
treacle
and
a
hint
of
graham
cracker
way
in
the
back
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
along
with
a
clear
vein
of
cola
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
moderate
carbonation
and
a
dry
crisp
finish
seriously
everything
falls
off
of
an
apparently
tall
and
steep
tabletop
at
the
end
making
me
wonder
whether
or
not
ive
even
had
anything
in
my
mouth
overall
this
is
an
interesting
beer
that
i
cant
pin
down
in
my
head
there
isnt
much
wheat
influence
as
i
can
tell
theres
plenty
of
roast
and
nothing
stays
long
enough
for
me
to
get
acquainted
i
guess
i
could
say
i
wouldnt
mind
having
another
but
im
not
likely
to
ever
seek
it
out
again
o
this
has
some
nice
unique
chocolate
wheat
character
but
the
green
bananas
and
young
wood
are
a
bit
odd
and
start
to
dominate
baaaad
boy
pours
a
black
color
with
a
very
small
head
there
is
a
roasted
aroma
with
hints
of
black
licorice
the
taste
is
slightly
roasted
with
hints
of
black
licorice
good
flavors
and
fully
body
flavors
overall
its
a
nice
beer
however
its
a
bit
boring
othis
is
a
pretty
unique
beer
with
way
more
flavors
going
on
than
i
would
have
expected
the
charred
flavors
are
a
bit
too
a
acrid
and
the
feel
was
a
bit
of
a
letdown
but
this
brew
was
a
nice
departure
from
the
standard
ipa
or
my
recent
hefe
obsession
drinkability
this
is
good
stuff
and
i
bet
it
is
superb
on
tap
i
think
i
have
a
reason
to
visit
sheboygan
now
its
quite
good
though
o
it
is
a
dark
sessionable
ale
that
has
similar
but
lacks
qualities
of
sprechers
black
bavarian
o
not
bad
but
of
the
3
sheeps
offerings
ive
tried
this
is
my
least
favorite
i
definitely
would
not
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
but
thats
just
like
my
opinion
man
far
out
in
the
mout
iits
all
iced
coffee
sweetened
as
if
with
sugar
from
the
table
refreshing
on
the
tongue
medium
to
light
body
with
the
perfect
sharp
carbonation
d
nicely
balanced
and
easy
drinking
pretty
good
stuff
thatd
be
a
lot
better
if
not
so
cold
served
with
a
smallish
tan
foamy
thick
creamy
head
that
slowly
settled
and
lots
of
sheeting
lace
color
is
an
opaque
brown
black
aroma
is
malt
and
roast
flavors
like
nose
with
good
balance
between
bitter
sweet
and
tang
body
and
carbonation
are
good
finish
is
like
flavor
slightly
long
and
very
drinkable
again
thered
be
a
lot
more
interesting
things
here
if
it
werent
so
cold
still
good
stuff
o
baaad
boys
bold
aroma
suggests
a
little
more
delicately
and
balanced
the
amount
of
roast
malt
used
in
its
process
but
the
flavor
doesnt
incorporate
the
same
level
of
balance
remaining
mediumbodied
and
lower
in
alcohol
content
baaad
boy
offers
a
darktasting
beer
without
the
filling
feeling
a
heavier
stout
might
produce
a
fine
start
at
a
dark
beer
for
3
sheeps
paired
with
cured
smoked
pork
shoulder
wild
boar
sausage
and
prosciutto
charcuterie
the
sweetness
of
the
beer
became
more
apparent
when
up
against
the
salty
cured
meats
offhand
im
not
sure
ive
had
another
imperial
black
wheat
the
coffee
flavor
dominates
and
that
is
fine
with
me
very
drinkable
coffee
flavored
beer
glad
i
have
more
in
the
fridge
b
pours
a
brown
color
14
inch

of
an
offwhite
color
good
retention
and
slight
lacing
smells
of
coffee
hint
of
sweet
malt
hint
of
roasted
malt
hint
of
pale
malt
and
a
hint
of
hops
fits
the
style
of
an
american
dark
wheat
ale
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
coffee
sweet
malt
hint
of
roasted
malt
hint
of
hop
hint
of
alcohol
and
slight
yeast
overall
good
aroma
body
and
blend
the
coffee
is
an
amazing
attribute
in
both
aroma
and
body
o
wow
this
is
a
damn
fine
beer
very
coffee
forward
and
full
of
flavor
o
a
phenomenal
beer
from
3
sheeps
in
a
blind
taste
i
would
bet
anyone
would
think
they
are
drinking
a
coffee
stout
only
the
finish
may
give
it
away
if
you
really
have
a
developed
palate
coffee
is
big
and
bold
in
this
beer
highly
recommend
it
a
great
unique
dark
wheat
ale
the
coffee
and
malt
make
love
together
with
enough
roast
and
just
a
hint
of
earthy
hops
to
make
it
wellbalanced
wonderfully
made
and
certainly
enjoyable
o
well
hello
there
joe
i
feel
like
i
should
have
poured
you
into
a
ceramic
mug
because
youre
damn
near
coffee
this
3
sheeps
seasonal
offering
screams
freshly
ground
freshly
brewed
coffee
through
and
through
so
much
so
in
fact
its
hard
to
detach
the
mind
from
the
bean
long
enough
to
admire
its
gently
wheat
and
balanced
roasted
malt
flavor
if
the
beer
smells
this
good
i
cant
even
imagine
how
fantastic
the
brewhouse
must
smell
on
joe
brew
day
if
its
straightup
coffee
youre
looking
for
in
a
beer
look
no
further
fantastic
coffee
beer
so
glad
i
grabbed
this
based
on
previous
reviews
and
a
recommendation
at
the
store
i
hate
the
taste
of
a
fresh
cup
of
coffee
coffee
in
beer
i
tend
to
find
amazing
this
fits
that
bill
packs
the
coffee
flavor
of
a
say
a
bourbon
county
coffee
but
drinks
so
much
easier
this
beer
is
a
must
for
coffeecoffee
beer
lovers
3
sheeps
will
grab
peoples
attention
with
this
concoction
for
sure
had
on
tap
at
a
milwaukee
beer
festival
last
summer
lovely
coffee
aroma
from
alterra
a
great
milwaukee
roaster
with
a
flavor
that
doesnt
overwhelm
this
is
a
wonderful
variation
on
their
alreadyterrific
baaad
boy
wheat
pours
nicely
too
even
on
a
chilly
day
overall
a
very
unique
and
delicious
coffee
beer
lighter
bodied
and
smoother
than
most
coffee
stouts
but
also
well
balanced
between
the
roasty
character
and
the
sweetness
of
the
brew
NA
o
not
bad
a
little
light
on
flavor
but
still
one
of
the
better
things
ive
tried
from
ab
taste
starts
out
with
a
very
artificial
chocolate
flavor
sweetness
throughout
with
a
hint
of
vanilla
fizzy
carbonation
makes
it
seems
like
a
chocolate
cola
than
a
a
beer
nice
beer
drinks
well
at
room
temp
or
cold
not
a
everyday
drink
for
me
but
a
nice
change
with
a
sweet
twist
o
this
kind
of
drinks
like
a
schwartzbier
only
not
as
strong
one
of
the
better
shock
top
beers
but
nothing
id
buy
again
overall
better
than
i
expected
a
sweet
chocolate
beer
that
if
perfect
for
a
winter
night
i
would
drink
it
again
we
need
to
call
a
spade
a
spade
here
this
really
isnt
half
as
bad
as
its
ratings
the
flavors
are
actually
pretty
good
in
it
the
chocolate
is
really
forward
and
honestly
not
all
that
sweet
compared
to
expectations
i
could
not
really
tell
you
its
a
wheat
beer
very
little
real
grain
character
to
this
one
but
i
will
say
that
i
like
it
better
than
plenty
of
craft
chocolate
beers
the
only
thing
here
is
that
it
sort
of
feels
cheap
the
mouthfeel
is
really
really
light
darkish
beer
for
people
who
dont
like
dark
beer
no
body
lots
of
bubbles
minimal
roasted
malt
balance
against
the
chocolate
its
simply
chocolate
in
the
flavor
which
i
dont
hate
but
its
not
that
beery
there
is
a
slight
metallic
property
right
before
the
swallow
and
the
thinness
gets
off
putting
but
it
tastes
pretty
good
honestly
and
holds
a
creamy
head
pretty
well
compared
to
its
peers
its
superior
we
owe
it
to
ourselves
to
admit
that
i
really
wanted
to
try
this
as
the
easiest
representative
of
the
style
to
find
i
think
that
i
would
like
to
try
others
from
this
type
american
dark
wheat
ale
cocoa
vanilla
in
front
round
on
mouthfeel
finish
is
sweet
and
soft
poured
according
to
label
swirl
final
12
and
pour
to
release
flavor
leaves
some
sediment
at
the
bottom
passable
but
not
recommendable
fare
o
really
not
a
bad
brew
especially
if
you
have
a
sweet
tooth
the
only
shock
top
that
did
not
make
me
want
to
vomit
this
was
surprisingly
good
poos
a
nice
dark
brown
a
very
nice
strong
chocolate
scent
and
flavor
i
was
quite
surprised
how
good
the
chocolate
taste
was
easy
to
drink
a
chocolate
wheat
i
was
very
skeptical
i
picked
this
up
with
low
expectations
but
wanted
a
sweet
beer
after
dinner
i
was
not
let
down
this
wheat
beer
poured
dark
and
the
chocolate
scent
was
pouring
out
of
the
glass
it
was
not
a
cheap
chocolate
smell
but
a
very
enjoyable
scent
this
beer
was
chocolate
and
delicious
it
was
a
perfect
desert
beer
and
not
too
sweet
for
me
it
drank
almost
too
easy
for
me
and
the
six
pack
did
not
last
too
long
i
strongly
recommend
this
beer
if
you
want
a
sweet
holiday
or
desert
beer
that
everyone
will
like
i
will
not
hesitate
to
buy
this
again
low
abv
not
a
bad
tasting
beer
but
ehhh
overall
surprisingly
good
was
not
expecting
this
to
be
any
good
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
like
chocolate
milk
with
the
exception
of
the
initial
sweetener
shortcoming
that
made
the
overall
beer
artificial
but
that
stopped
to
bother
shortly
the
flavors
actually
matched
easy
to
drink
and
fine
for
chocolate
lovers
dark
brown
mild
cocoa
aroma
thin
bodied
with
a
touch
of
chocolate
flavor
not
too
sweet
but
nothing
to
really
rave
about
here
either
had
a
very
fake
chocolate
syrupy
taste
pours
a
dark
black
with
little
head
the
smell
is
full
of
vanilla
and
chocolate
the
taste
was
a
bit
disappointing
with
some
wheat
flavors
in
the
beginning
and
then
finishing
with
a
lot
of
sugar
which
to
me
gave
it
a
lackluster
aftertaste
that
stuck
around
for
too
long
i
think
it
was
interesting
and
it
wasnt
bad
but
for
me
i
probably
wouldnt
buy
again
had
a
sample
of
this
and
no
way
would
i
want
to
drink
a
full
bottle
fake
chocolate
taste
sickly
sweet
and
cloying
not
an
appealing
beer
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
pitch
black
with
an
off
white
head
that
disappears
almost
immediately
smells
of
chocolate
and
vanilla
nice
inviting
tastes
of
weak
grain
with
chocolate
aftertaste
beer
is
light
bodied
and
smooth
easy
to
drink
overall
a
slightly
above
average
beer
very
sweet
and
very
chocolatey
some
find
it
cloying
i
think
its
perfectly
refreshing
and
dessertlike
around
the
holidays
its
ok
to
admit
you
like
this
beer
12
ounce
bottle
one
of
my
friends
gave
me
a
bottle
to
try
served
in
a
mug
the
beer
pours
dark
brown
with
about
a
half
inch
light
tan
head
head
retention
is
decent
and
there
isnt
much
lacing
aroma
is
nice
and
sweet
it
smells
mostly
like
milk
chocolate
and
malted
milk
balls
along
with
some
wheatbready
malt
and
vanilla
i
think
the
taste
is
just
like
the
aroma
however
i
think
the
malted
milk
ball
flavor
is
the
strongest
of
them
mouthfeelbody
is
thin
but
its
also
a
bit
slick
with
moderate
carbonation
this
isnt
a
bad
brew
at
all
i
liked
it
definitely
worth
a
try
especially
if
you
like
sweet
chocolate
beers
not
bad
not
good
its
tasty
enough
to
be
better
than
ok
but
it
holds
a
very
artificial
facade
overall
an
excellent
dessert
beer
it
really
is
the
dessert
in
and
of
itself
although
it
could
pair
remarkably
well
with
a
huge
range
of
items
and
an
excellent
holiday
beer
as
well
although
i
think
the
sweetness
really
cuts
its
drinkability
down
to
one
or
perhaps
two
for
those
with
a
bit
of
a
sweettooth
tried
this
on
tap
at
a
bar
in
a
shopping
center
with
my
wife
while
she
was
on
a
shopping
break
not
much
choice
at
this
place
but
this
was
surprisingly
dark
in
appearance
with
a
low
light
brown
head
that
dissipated
fast
some
lacing
but
not
a
lot
smell
was
so
chocolatey
that
it
surprised
even
the
wife
who
considers
herself
a
chocolate
connosueir
she
liked
it
more
than
me
it
had
a
light
taste
and
was
heavily
carbonated
chocolate
was
a
strong
flavor
but
it
was
too
sweet
for
more
than
a
pint
overall
i
was
impressed
by
this
ab
inbev
brew
poured
darker
than
guinness
the
chocolate
and
vanilla
are
good
blended
nicely
reminded
me
of
a
porter
with
low
abv
i
would
buy
this
again
but
i
would
not
hesitate
to
try
something
better
i
would
never
turn
down
one
if
offered
if
you
are
just
starting
to
expand
your
darkbeer
horizons
try
this
beer
but
make
sure
you
like
chocolate
presentation
packaged
in
a
custom
twelveounce
brown
glass
long
neck
bottle
with
a
twistoff
crown
served
in
a
new
belgium
brewing
chalice
rjt
o
pretty
good
chocolate
seems
an
odd
thing
to
put
in
a
wheat
beer
but
it
works
its
refreshing
and
it
tastes
good
worth
a
try
o
this
beer
is
pleasant
but
really
tastes
like
someone
poured
some
hersheys
chocolate
syrup
into
a
wheat
beer
it
would
make
for
a
good
dessert
beer
for
someone
who
is
just
getting
into
craft
beers
meh
shock
top
chocolate
wheat
is
a
brew
anheuser
busch
this
brew
pours
like
black
coffee
im
not
saying
that
is
a
bad
thing
you
can
taste
the
chocolate
this
really
dose
not
taste
like
beer
but
this
is
an
enjoyable
brew
this
was
a
different
but
i
like
it
this
is
an
outstanding
brew
i
will
get
this
brew
to
switch
it
up
from
budweiser
im
not
a
beer
snob
so
this
review
wont
be
technical
i
first
had
this
beer
on
tap
and
fell
in
love
at
first
drink
bought
it
bottled
the
next
day
this
beer
is
dark
in
color
but
has
a
nice
light
taste
its
like
heaven
in
your
mouth
ive
had
it
alone
with
a
salad
and
it
was
super
yummy
with
raspberry
cheesecake
i
am
going
to
try
mixing
it
with
the
shock
top
raspberry
wheat
this
weekend
will
let
you
know
how
that
is
the
body
cant
quite
seem
to
define
itself
it
feels
a
little
thin
with
a
definite
spritz
to
it
that
isnt
quite
crispness
it
feels
clean
though
and
overall
its
neither
good
nor
bad
pours
a
very
dark
brown
almost
black
in
color
probably
the
darkest
beer
by
the
bud
folks
so
far
close
to
a
fingers
worth
of
beige
head
that
settles
down
quickly
to
just
around
the
tops
and
sides
of
the
glass
some
spotty
lacing
is
seen
the
aroma
is
very
pleasant
with
cocoa
powder
vanilla
with
some
spices
the
taste
is
actually
about
the
same
no
harsh
or
bitter
aftertaste
at
all
goes
down
pretty
easy
overall
it
is
different
but
not
really
bad
as
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
bud
products
overall
except
for
a
select
few
this
has
to
be
one
of
the
darkest
colored
beers
that
ab
has
ever
produced
its
a
chocolate
wheat
aged
on
cocoa
and
vanilla
beans
with
spices
large
tan
head
fine
bubbles
fades
slowly
pretty
impressive
look
to
it
aroma
has
subtle
cocoa
creamy
vanilla
notes
nothing
in
the
way
of
noticeable
spice
additions
on
the
nose
flavor
has
a
milk
chocolate
creamy
character
hints
of
dark
roasts
bring
a
bit
of
balance
the
vanilla
seems
to
be
there
throughout
each
sip
and
doesnt
really
fade
away
super
sweet
for
me
a
bit
more
dark
roasts
might
round
it
out
it
feels
like
a
hybrid
wheatmilk
stout
with
all
of
the
lactose
induced
sweetness
mouthfeel
is
creamy
smooth
textured
medium
bodied
ample
even
carbonation
overall
i
cant
really
complain
and
i
havent
attempted
mixing
this
with
the
standard
shock
top
as
the
label
of
the
six
pack
holder
depicts
making
black
and
tans
with
the
two
the
chocolate
is
big
on
the
nose
but
not
so
big
in
the
taste
although
it
is
the
dominating
feature
crisp
mild
bitterness
toward
the
end
it
does
not
hand
around
long
drinks
quickly
but
not
necessarily
easy
poured
into
a
trusty
pint
glass
black
in
color
and
fingers
worth
of
head
mild
chocolaty
and
very
smooth
and
easy
going
i
wish
i
had
tried
this
one
sooner
one
of
the
better
shock
top
products
out
there
another
good
beer
to
drink
on
a
cold
winter
day
edit
appearance
was
the
high
scoring
category
for
this
beer
until
i
discovered
the
nasty
glob
of
mystery
goo
at
the
bottom
of
my
glass
o
more
intense
than
expected
from
anbev
but
has
issues
of
balance
overall
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
looking
for
a
truly
chocolate
tasting
beer
however
i
bought
this
beer
in
a
combined
6
pack
with
shock
tops
white
belgian
and
i
would
take
the
chocolate
wheat
over
the
white
belgian
any
day
a
nice
dessert
brew
this
is
one
of
the
best
chocolate
beers
ive
sampled
and
makes
an
excellent
winter
beer
i
bought
this
as
part
of
a
half
and
half
six
pack
containing
three
chocolate
wheats
and
three
belgian
whites
that
supposedly
make
a
good
black
and
tan
ill
probably
try
that
at
some
point
but
im
not
sure
how
to
review
it
had
a
great
chocolate
aroma
got
it
in
a
build
a
six
pack
at
kroger
wish
i
had
just
bought
a
six
pack
of
this
i
like
the
organic
chocolate
stout
from
the
more
expensive
brand
it
is
better
but
for
my
pocket
this
is
a
good
sub
the
mouth
feel
is
a
bit
thinner
and
the
taste
is
a
bit
more
corporate
this
has
to
be
the
best
beer
i
drink
this
year
this
beer
is
very
close
to
winter
bourbon
cask
ale
and
that
was
their
best
beer
just
a
great
tasting
beer
with
chocolate
in
it
taste
wonderful
from
top
to
bottom
with
a
little
vanilla
that
not
over
powering
so
sit
back
just
suck
it
down
enjoy
this
beer
because
you
never
how
long
it
will
last
overall
they
do
pack
a
lot
of
sweet
chocolate
into
a
rather
modest
abv
brew
if
looking
for
something
very
chocolaty
and
sweet
with
a
lighter
abv
then
this
may
be
a
good
choice
but
otherwise
the
beer
has
a
very
nice
taste
and
fits
the
shocktop
line
of
beers
nicely
i
enjoyed
it
by
itsself
or
with
the
belgium
wheat
o
not
very
tasty
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
mild
kick
not
the
best
representation
of
style
typical
beer
from
the
shock
top
series
taste
falls
apart
on
it
a
little
bit
the
malting
is
so
damn
light
it
is
watery
despite
the
cocoa
and
plasticy
vanilla
flavor
not
a
whole
lot
of
anything
else
the
cocoa
flavors
are
probably
the
best
thing
going
for
it
but
even
the
leinenkugels
cocoa
porter
has
more
going
for
it
than
this
sister
in
law
brought
a
horrendous
mixed
sixer
ab
is
pushing
that
has
this
beer
and
the
regular
shock
top
3
of
each
and
you
are
supposed
to
mix
them
yuck
mixed
is
worse
than
this
by
itself
by
a
longshot
o
this
could
definitely
appeal
to
those
who
hate
beer
hell
even
i
think
its
perfectly
reasonable
still
the
appeal
is
mainly
limited
to
aforementioned
beer
haters
and
chocolate
lovers
id
never
refuse
one
of
these
regardless
overall
not
a
terrific
beer
but
a
pretty
good
sweet
chocolate
winter
seasonal
additionally
i
mixed
half
of
the
chocolate
wheat
with
the
regular
belgian
white
as
suggested
on
the
box
5050
mix
not
bad
the
orange
although
interesting
overpowers
the
chocolate
slightly
ill
have
to
experiment
a
little
more
but
certainly
worth
the
try
oit
says
to
mix
this
with
a
shock
top
wheat
but
i
just
tasted
it
without
it
was
good
i
will
try
it
mixed
another
day
NA
NA
NA
NA
i
didnt
enjoy
this
beer
that
much
that
being
said
they
are
a
young
brewery
and
i
will
likely
try
their
other
beers

malty
sweetness
and
very
smooth
pours
a
foggy
caramel
color
with
a
head
that
recedes
quickly
leaves
nice
lacing
as
it
goes
on
the
nose
you
can
detect
honey
biscuit
clove
hay
on
my
first
sip
im
hit
with
honey
toffee
caramel
straw
some
banana
clove
raisins
the
willamette
hops
provide
a
long
earthy
hop
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
light
with
moderatelow
carbonation
this
is
very
drinkable
with
some
great
notes
perfect
for
a
chilly
fall
day
for
5
00
per
bomber
id
say
this
is
the
best
value
that
berkshire
offers
i
would
highly
recommend
trying
it
and
just
for
kicks
i
would
also
recommend
a
blind
taste
test
against
some
of
the
more
famous
trappist
ales
the
results
might
be
surprising
the
beer
is
not
overly
complex
but
is
certainly
not
flawed
and
makes
for
an
enjoyable
evening
best
dark
wheat
beer
ive
had
in
ages
upon
ages
needed
this
one
bad
missing
four
nights
of
further
at
red
rocks
for
an
academic
conference
in
western
mass
funny
they
should
have
a
lost
sailor
and
saint
of
circumstance
ipa
but
thats
for
later
on
enjoying
the
live
stream
though
enough
this
pours
a
decadent
caramel
color
with
a
lovely
but
short
lived
khaki
head
the
nose
assaults
me
the
second
i
crack
the
bomber
rich
copper
and
toffee
notes
from
the
english
malt
and
an
almost
german
banana
or
plantain
character
from
the
yeast
a
really
delicious
autumn
combination
the
taste
is
just
identical
to
the
nose
perfect
from
one
to
the
other
the
banana
over
the
darker
wheat
malt
is
just
sensational
feel
is
also
exquisite
with
a
fuller
body
soft
in
feel
but
still
well
carbonated
this
impressed
the
hell
out
of
me
for
less
than
5
bucks
a
bomber
really
this
is
great
stuff
dying
to
crack
the
ipa
i
got
too
go
berkshire
brewing
hell
of
a
first
impression
never
would
guess
its
7
abv
either
drinks
like
4
overall
a
very
nice
beer
combines
the
crispness
and
light
body
of
a
wheat
beer
with
the
robust
malty
smoothness
of
say
a
dopplebock
one
of
my
favorites
from
berkshire
a
definitely
a
brew
for
a
malt
aficionado
river
ale
is
super
tasty
and
fairly
unique
certainly
worth
trying
when
you
can
find
it
river
ale
is
a
yearround
brew
for
bbc
but
i
think
it
is
an
excellent
beer
for
fall
o
a
very
nice
wheat
ale
with
good
malt
tones
and
mild
hop
balance
the
yeast
qualities
add
esters
and
phenols
that
work
well
with
the
brew
as
a
whole
overall
this
beer
absolutely
rubs
me
the
right
way
more
please
thanks
to
davey101
for
this
one
o
a
very
solid
dark
wheat
with
a
good
amount
of
fruitiness
and
flavor
very
easy
to
drink
and
solidly
refreshing
i
can
see
why
this
is
at
the
top
of
the
style
o
my
first
of
the
style
but
i
reckon
its
a
pretty
good
one
ive
had
this
a
few
times
and
i
must
say
its
one
of
the
most
unique
brews
ive
had
flavorful
and
highly
drinkable
the
only
other
american
style
dark
wheat
ale
ive
had
was
mayflowers
and
that
one
doesnt
touch
this
thanks
to
davey101
for
sending
this
to
me

pours
into
a
mug
a
dark
wheat
bread
color
weird
huh
smells
and
tastes
like
warm
bread
from
the
oven
full
wheat
body
with
hints
of
yeast
a
little
hops
some
burnt
sugar
and
alochol
is
also
detectable
full
body
good
carbonation
smooth
creamy
body
with
a
slight
hop
bite
on
the
finish
really
like
this
beer
after
receiving
this
i
realized
i
needed
it
to
knock
out
the
style
and
what
a
solid
representation
of
the
style
it
is
cheers
overall
a
great
sweeter
brew
wonderful
flavors
and
a
great
warming
feel
fantastic
odone
of
berkshires
more
unique
brews
i
think
they
craft
cool
beer
at
a
good
price
and
this
is
no
different
not
my
favorite
in
their
lineup
but
i
must
say
that
there
should
be
more
dark
wheat
ales
out
on
the
market
because
it
is
a
neat
style
seek
this
out
this
beer
is
a
little
heavy
for
summer
i
would
recommend
it
for
the
cooler
months
if
youre
looking
for
a
light
bright
wheat
beer
for
a
summer
day
this
is
not
it
this
is
right
in
the
medium
level
for
body
and
is
a
little
sticky
on
the
tongue
drinkability
is
the
name
of
river
ales
game
no
flavor
is
over
eatin
which
i
feel
is
an
asset
here
recommended
for
fan
is
the
style

drink
a
nice
beer
nice
layers
good
flavors
and
a
unique
style
better
than
an
average
wheat
i
wouldnt
mind
another
bottle
to
sip
on
o
very
excellent
beer
overall
really
enjoyed
this
much
more
than
i
was
expecting
and
look
forward
to
getting
another
round
of

in
the
near
future
appearance

of
wheat
more
caramel
syrup
caramel
but
also
some
hops
in
there
a
pleasant
mouthfeel
smooth
balanced
for
its
characteristics
this
is
one
of
the
better
options
from
this
brewery
out
of
western
mass
nice
beer
it
reminds
me
of
a
weizenbock
for
the
dark
fruity
notes
the
aroma
has
more
malt
character
with
a
gentle
toast
and
milk
chocolate
the
flavor
is
slightly
sweet
and
the
body
is
a
medium
weight
that
rolls
down
smoothly
over
the
cocoa
runs
figs
and
a
creamy
rum
spices
while
most
american
wheat
beers
turn
out
fairly
boring
this
is
a
tasty
dark
ale
that
belongs
in
the
same
realm
as
dubbels
and
weizenbocks
o
an
all
around
good
beer

davey101
my
buddy
and
i
really
enjoyed
it
o
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
not
sure
if
this
is
something
i
would
like
to
drink
more
than
one
glass
of
though
overall
a
real
pleasant
surprise
did
not
expect
to
enjoy
this
beer
as
much
as
i
am
just
really
flavorful
and
tasty
hands
down
my
favorite
offering
to
date
from
berkshire
from
the
bottle
marked
best
by
91511
sampled
on
july
12
2011
the
pour
is
an
extremely
heady
medium
amber
the
aroma
is
alive
with
sweet
caramel
malts
but
not
a
lot
of
wheat
spice
or
hops
it
is
single
hopped
so
that
might
make
it
more
subtle
the
taste
is
also
quite
sweet
and
malty
overall
a
malty
beer
with
a
tickle
of
hops
on
the
tail
end
great
for
a
hot
day
o
this
is
my
first
american
dark
wheat
ale
and
im
in
love
i
was
gonna
either
grab
this
or
the
coffee
house
porter
which
ive
had
numerous
times
i
made
the
right
decision
bbc
is
a
real
gem
of
a
brewery
always
amazingly
fresh
and
well
crafted
beers
and
i
can
find
bombers
everywhere
for
under
4
seek
this
out
o
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
dark
wheat
a
great
job
by
bbc
and
at
a
great
price
of
3
99
a
bomber
i
will
surely
have
more
of
these
overall
i
thought
it
was
good
having
not
knowing
anything
about
this
beer
before
i
drank
it
i
enjoyed
it
overall
its
like
drinking
a
loaf
of
delicious
homebaked
bread
and
who
doesnt
love
homebaked
bread
ok
except
for
people
with
gluten
issues
who
doesnt
love
homebaked
bread
another
winner
for
the
folks
at
bbc
big
ups
to
western
mass
o
this
is
my
favorite
beer
by
bbc
the
coffee
house
porter
is
a
close
second
the
alcohol
is
detectable
but
doesnt
deter
i
could
easily
down
two
of
these
bad
boys
in
the
springtime
and
here
i
go
pours
a
light
brown
color
with
a
light
head
and
just
a
touch
of
lacing
color
is
like
toffee
the
nose
brings
some
light
caramel
and
a
slight
nuttiness
there
is
a
bit
of
light
milk
chocolate
there
as
well
the
flavor
is
a
bit
plain
much
like
the
nose
not
much
there
really
doing
great
things
light
chocolate
nuttiness
mild
caramel
and
a
bit
of
lightlysweet
malt
body
is
smooth
and
creamy
the
best
aspect
of
the
beer
overall
not
bad
at
all
though
not
something
i
would
seek
out
again
cheers
pours
a
clear
brown
with
a
lot
of
light
head
smells
wheaty
and
fairly
nondescript
its
exactly
as
mild
as
i
expected
tastes
sweet
and
malty
a
nice
wheat
presence
with
some
fruits
of
some
sort
raisins
perhaps
overall
pretty
good
for
what
it
is
nothing
crazy
but
solid
good
drinker
really
flavorful
add
to
the
list
of
wins
for
bbc
da
nice
mellow
dark
wheat
beer
very
easy
to
drink
poured
a
cloudy
medium
brown
with
a
large
frothy
off
white
head
that
was
mostly
diminishing
and
had
excellent
lacing
the
aroma
was
heavy
of
roasted
caramel
malts
molasses
with
nice
hints
of
an
earthy
yeast
toffee
and
raisons
it
tasted
sweetly
smooth
and
mildly
acidic
in
the
beginning
then
progressed
to
a
nice
sweet
malty
flavor
and
had
notes
of
caramel
and
dried
fruit
with
the
flavor
lasting
a
nice
while
mouthfeel
was
medium
in
body
and
nice
and
creamy
in
texture
with
a
nice
mild
carbonation
overall
a
fantastic
tasting
dark
wheat
ale
very
drinkable
drinkability
a
simple
malty
sweetleaning
beer
that
goes
down
with
ease
however
at
7
you
might
not
want
to
just
plow
through
the
bomber
though
i
couldnt
help
do
so
drinkability
is
great
this
was
a
pleasant
surprise
very
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
nicely
done
berkshire
this
is
a
keeper
db
damn
this
gets
alcoholic
probably
the
strongest
7
beer
in
existence
the
aroma
led
me
to
think
it
was
going
to
be
very
complex
and
smooth
but
the
alcohol
really
takes
away
here
drinkability
good
tasteful
thick
quality
flavors
i
like
it
beer
has
a
subtle
roast
to
it
and
is
mildly
sweet
its
kind
of
like
an
unbittered
brown
porter
its
not
overly
sweet
the
flavors
overall
are
a
little
subdued
there
is
some
mild
fruitiness
to
this
beer
i
dont
know
how
old
it
is
it
could
be
past
its
prime
but
the
most
likely
conclusion
is
that
this
is
just
a
boring
strong
ale
too
bad
drinkability
a
malty
treat
that
is
very
easy
to
drink
there
is
something
unique
about
this
beer
that
i
am
having
trouble
putting
my
finger
on
malty
warming
and
lightly
spicy
comes
across
as
a
strong
malty
brown
ale
with
a
little
something
extra
another
wellbalanced
and
wellcrafted
beer
from
berkshire
brewing
co
great
beer
rich
and
enjoyable
without
so
much
alcohol
that
you
notice
but
it
sneaks
up
on
you
too
you
could
do
2
bombers
but
then
well
youd
be
bombed
not
extreme
but
well
balanced
good
fresh
beer
d
a
good
beer
but
not
one
i
would
seek
out
overall
a
good
brew
and
one
of
my
favorites
from
bbc
will
buy
again
d
this
beer
was
good
but
not
all
that
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
the
flavors
were
good
in
it
and
for
that
drinking
22oz
would
be
no
problem
the
sweetness
in
it
though
made
it
a
little
rough
once
it
started
to
warm
up
d
pretty
interesting
brew
looks
great
smells
great
tastes
ok
decent
brew
from
bbc
overall
the
only
turnoff
is
that
weird
metallic
presence
across
the
board
the
mouthfeel
is
great
and
abv
completely
hidden
i
have
a
bunch
more
bbc
brews
to
try
around
the
house
and
am
looking
forward
to
them
f
still
semi
sweet
more
syrupy
malt
with
some
sour
lingering
malt
flavor
more
like
a
soured
malt
than
an
infection
but
its
def
there
little
toasty
and
a
hint
of
spiciness
with
a
touch
of
bitterness
round
off
the
finish
not
a
bad
drop
but
just
needs
more
flavour
to
keep
me
interested
fair
punch
but
not
enough
flourish
feeldrink
great
creamy
sweet
mouthfeel
medium
bodied
drinkability
is
nice
enjoy
this
over
time
taste
is
much
like
the
nose
sweet
and
malty
but
a
little
brown
sugar
and
some
chocolate
very
similar
to
a
belgian
dubble
probably
closest
to
ommegang
medium
body
very
smooth
on
the
palate
alcohol
is
well
balanced
in
this
drink
and
its
a
great
one
to
share
and
pair
with
a
great
meal
d
this
is
yet
another
great
offer
by
berkshire
in
the
description
the
bar
considered
it
the
east
coast
version
of
fat
tire
suggest
this
highly
good
enough
brew
but
too
sweet
for
my
taste
really
struck
me
as
a
borderline
fruit
beer
more
than
a
strong
ale
pours
a
rich
chocolate
with
small
head
that
is
retained
well
smell
islightly
sweet
with
some
hop
undertones
taste
is
rich
malty
with
just
enough
hopr
presence
to
prevent
cloying
alcohol
presence
is
there
but
notoverpowering
mouthfeel
is
rich
fullbodied
smooth
very
dinkable
for
a
7
abv
i
wouldnt
be
against
having
a
bit
of
chocolate
cake
with
this
offering
d
definitely
one
to
share
with
a
buddy
at
7
and
with
a
character
as
complex
as
this
ale
has
you
should
sip
it
in
limited
quantities
very
interesting
and
a
fruity
ale
flavor
fanatics
dream
quite
good
overall
again
another
very
solid
offering
here
and
a
really
nice
way
to
cap
off
the
berkshire
session
i
am
very
impressed
with
what
they
have
to
offer
and
would
gladly
do
this
one
again
d
this
was
a
pleasant
easy
to
drink
beer
at
7
its
not
much
of
a
strong
ale
but
it
was
enjoyable
enough
thanks
to
brothercannon
for
bring
me
a
bottle
of
this
and
a
few
other
berkshires
back
from
vt
poured
from
a
22
ounce
bomber
into
my
nonic

the
ale

are
of
sweet

toffee
brown

toasted
bready
grains
and
some
earthy
bitter

about
a
notch
better
than
medium

with
adequate

worth
a
try
if
you
are
a
fan
of
a
strong

nearly
clear
dark

kind
of

a
bottle
this
is
such
a
good
beer
to
be
such
a
good
price
this
is
what
a
strong
ale
should
be
like
malty
nice
mouthfeel
big
abv
and
a
good
price
highly
recommened
drinkability
rarely
do
i
lose
track
of
the
number
of
beers
i
have
in
a
pub
but
i
cant
tell
you
how
many
i
had
one
night
i
can
tell
you
this
beer
will
let
yo
uknow
the
next
day
it
is
a
very
easy
to
drink
beer
and
will
invite
you
to
another
everytime
super
smooth
and
easy
drinking
wow
i
am
easily
going
to
polish
off
this
bomber
myself
especially
since
they
dont
sell
this
any
other
way
the
pour
looks
good
a
copperbrown
color
with
a
nice
frothy
lace
that
leaves
a
mark
on
the
glass
with
every
sip
the
smell
was
of
sweet
malts
a
little
bit
of
hops
and
a
little
sting
of
alcohol
the
taste
is
not
too
far
off
from
that
its
dominated
by
sweet
malts
right
up
fronts
caramel
toffee
and
bready
and
toasted
notes
still
the
flavor
ends
up
with
a
doublebite
along
with
the
sweetness
a
little
bit
of
alcohol
and
a
mild
touch
of
hops
unfortunately
the
combination
of
flavors
especially
the
sweetness
combined
with
a
somewhat
thick
mouthfeel
gives
a
slightly
syrupy
feel
to
the
beer
however
the
high
level
of
carbonation
saves
the
beer
overall
its
an
enjoyable
beer
to
drink
with
plenty
of
flavor
drinkability
its
good
stuff
and
i
could
drink
a
couple
of
these
but
there
are
other
beers
by
these
guys
i
prefer
d
nice
body
but
will
need
to
resample
as
the
flavor
was
one
dimensional
on
this
draft
plus
i
have
always
enjoyed
berkshires
offerings
in
the
past
notes
from
11607
the
taste
is
a
deep
caramel
flavor
with
a
big
malt
palate
some
roasted
notes
and
a
sweetish
almost
candied
butterscotch
flavor
maybe
a
tad
brown
sugary
the
beer
is
not
much
carbonated
medium
bodied
quite
smooth
a
slight
hop
presence
more
towards
the
finish
and
maybe
some
warming
abv
in
the
finish
as
well
for
a
7
beer
this
hides
and
masks
the
alcohol
extremely
well
this
is
a
solid
big
malty
beer
and
is
a
nice
treat
lchaim
another
excellent
choice
from
bcb
this
one
is
about
two
shades
darker
than
their
apa
being
somewhat
rubycolored
when
held
up
to
a
light
with
a
decent
tan
head
the
head
lets
go
a
lovely
bouquet
of
malty
caramel
and
even
a
little
alcohol
but
also
some
nice
dark
tones
of
toffee
and
fruit
this
is
one
of
those
beers
i
want
to
smell
as
much
as
drink
the
malt
is
front
and
center
with
this
one
but
youll
find
that
the
hops
gives
a
subtle
whack
as
you
swallow
the
7
0
abv
gives
it
some
warmth
but
the
alcohol
remains
in
the
background
as
with
many
bcb
beers
the
carbonation
is
relatively
low
so
the
overall
feel
is
smooth
making
the
beer
highly
drinkable
worth
going
out
of
your
way
to
find
and
as
always
its
extremely
affordable
buy
two
drinkability
real
nice
taste
recommend
this
beer
big
on
malt
and
taste
here
served
in
my
bbc
pint
poured
the
color
of
unpasteurized
apple
cider
with
a
one
inch
dense
offwhite
cap
that
eventually
dissipates
into
a
consistent
skim
murky
clarity
with
bands
of
thick
lacing
that
were
revealed
after
each
quaff
nose
is
caramel
and
pale
malts
as
well
as
some
sugar
and
light
fruity
esters
perhaps
pear
taste
follows
nose
as
well
as
a
bready
character
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
and
wellbalanced
with
a
nice
amount
of
carbonation
to
round
it
all
out
some
of
the
breadiness
in
the
taste
lingers
at
the
finish
easy
drinking
and
flavorful
brew
bbc
doesnt
make
a
bad
beer
in
my
opinion
and
this
is
definitely
one
of
my
favorites
muddy
reddish
color
not
very
carbonated
i
noticed
a
caramel
aroma
the
minute
i
poured
this
out
quite
malty
smelling
good
solid
malty
flavor
somewhat
caramel
flavor
minor
astringency
in
the
backround
knocks
it
down
a
peg
bitterness
upfront
quickly
fades
decent
body
a
good
enough
beer
the
astringency
tends
to
overshadow
it
a
bit
for
me
at
7
i
dont
think
it
is
from
the
alcohol
but
maybe
worth
a
try
for
sure
overall
another
solid
offering
from
berkshire
i
dont
know
if
they
make
the
best
beer
in
ma
but
they
are
my
favorite
brewery
in
ma
22
oz
bomber
the
appearance
is
a
dark
brownamber
color
with
a
thinned
head
and
no
real
lacing
aromas
are
thin
but
apparent
with
a
slightly
smoked
malt
aroma
sweet
roasty
caramel
tones
to
it
taste
excels
beyond
what
the
aromas
hinted
at
strong
sweetness
of
bready
malts
good
mouthfeel
helps
smooth
this
drink
out
without
hindering
a
solid
carbonation
overall
an
excellent
drink
from
bbc
another
tasty
brew
from
berkshire
the
pour
resulted
in
a
fingers
worth
of
ecru
head
with
good
retention
the
color
was
a
cloudy
golden
amber
the
nose
was
mildly
sweet
sort
of
like
butterscotch
but
not
in
a
bad
way
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
a
solid
caramel
taste
on
the
tongue
the
finish
was
lingeringly
caramellike
it
really
masked
its
alcohol
well
but
the
sweetness
was
a
bit
overpowering
for
a
hophead
such
as
myself
the
feel
is
thick
and
creamy
and
very
malty
a
good
decent
ale
not
a
ton
of
flavor
but
easy
drinking
22
oz
bomber
unfiltered
unpasteurized
and
bestby
4808
brewed
with
a
portion
of
wheat
malt
and
sampled
a
month
ago
it
pours
a
deep
crimson
with
medium
carbonation
and
two
inches
of
tight
light
tan
head
that
recedes
to
a
clingy
collar
a
bit
of
a
wheat
twang
in
the
nose
along
with
grassy
malts
caramel
molasses
and
some
earthy
leafygreen
hops
very
malty
body
with
flavors
of
caramel
and
earthygrassy
malts
hints
of
chocolate
and
toffee
tart
wheat
and
a
mild
clean
bitterness
it
has
a
medium
lightlycarbonated
body
that
delivers
a
staying
maltiness
while
becoming
ever
crisper
and
dryer
an
interesting
brew
that
is
hard
to
define
wouldnt
really
peg
it
as
a
strong
ale
but
not
really
sure
what
else
to
call
it
while
not
my
favorite
from
bbc
it
is
fairly
tasty
and
quite
drinkable
for
a
beer
with
an
aboveaverage
abv
despite
the
heft
this
dangerously
drinkable
dont
cross
the
river
if
you
cant
swim
the
tide
luckily
im
an
alright
swimmer
stellar
strong
ale
drinkability
this
is
the
best
strong
ale
ive
had
yet
largely
due
to
the
lack
of
over
powering
bittering
hops
and
dark
malts
drinkability
wise
i
liked
it
very
much
im
not
sure
if
i
would
want
any
more
than
this
one
but
i
will
definately
be
revisiting
this
one
again
a
very
tasty
beer
from
bbc
for
any
malthead
probably
my
new
fav
from
one
of
my
favorite
new
england
breweries
i
was
actually
surprised
to
read
on
the
site
that
its
only
7
they
dont
list
the
abv
on
the
bottle
from
the
taste
i
thought
it
would
be
more
a
delicious
warmer
to
have
on
hand
especially
in
this
season
but
i
prefer
to
split
this
bomber
with
a
friend
its
definitely
strong
but
not
in
the
sense
that
i
expected
it
reminds
me
of
arrogant
bastard
but
with
the
exception
that
theres
a
different
character
to
it
the
alcohol
is
never
too
overwhelming
and
allows
the
other
flavors
to
come
through
overall
a
tasty
and
well
balanced
strong
ale
i
feel
that
this
is
a
very
underrated
beer
from
the
bbc
brownishamber
in
color
with
minimal
lacing
like
most
strong
ales
the
alcohol
is
very
apparent
in
this
beer
the
sweet
toasted
malt
character
of
the
beer
is
enhanced
by
hidden
flavors
of
dark
fruit
one
can
draw
similarities
between
this
style
and
the
belgian
strong
ales
i
believe
that
the
american
strong
ale
is
a
slightly
subdued
version
for
beer
drinkers
that
want
a
local
favorite
give
river
ale
a
try
behind
the
coffee
house
porter
this
is
probably
my
favorite
offering
by
the
berkshire
brewing
company
pours
a
brownish
color
nice
carbonation
nice
little
creamy
offwhite
head
some
nice
sticky
lacing
follows
the
nose
is
sweet
malty
with
a
lot
of
caramel
the
taste
is
sweetmalty
and
some
caramel
medium
body
drinkable
this
is
a
nice
tasty
asa
but
it
just
does
not
have
the
kick
of
other
asas
recommended
though
what
a
surprise
when
i
found
out
this
beer
was
7
so
easy
to
drink
it
is
scary
drinkability
didnt
finish
this
one
goes
pretty
badly
with
a
spicy
steak
burrito
that
was
a
mistake
should
have
found
out
more
about
the
beer
ahead
of
time
but
would
certianly
be
nice
to
wind
down
with
drinkability
rich
with
deep
fruity
flavors
and
a
complex
finish
excellent
pours
relatively
clear
and
dark
brown
with
a
light
head
that
leaves
a
ring
of
lace
the
aroma
is
not
terribly
complex
some
nutty
malts
and
spicy
sweetness
it
reminds
me
of
a
doppelbock
or
maybe
a
weizenbock
made
with
american
yeast
on
the
palate
initial
sweetness
gives
way
to
thick
molasses
and
savory
spice
flavors
with
an
increasingly
nutty
very
sweet
finish
mouthfeel
is
very
thick
and
a
bit
viscous
with
minimal
carbonation
overall
this
beer
is
ok
but
it
doesnt
have
a
hook
theres
no
one
thing
thats
special
about
this
beer
still
its
drinkable
and
tasty
enough
overall
a
wonderfull
yet
not
overly
impressive
beer
selection
im
happy
to
have
this
local
fresh
selection
i
will
definately
have
this
beer
again
d
very
tasty
goes
down
quite
easily
slightly
filling
but
theres
no
trace
of
the
7
00
abv
i
had
wanted
to
try
this
beer
for
a
while
and
then
had
it
at
a
tasting
about
a
month
ago
even
after
the
tasting
i
wasnt
quite
sure
how
much
i
would
like
it
but
i
gave
bbc
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
because
they
havent
steered
me
wrong
yet
it
was
a
wise
decision
because
i
liked
this
beer
a
lot
pours
a
clear
dark
mahogony
with
a
medium
head
with
no
lacing
not
bad
colorbut
the
head
is
smallish
and
theres
no
lacing
hurting
the
rating
the
smell
is
abit
weak
with
sweet
malt
and
some
bisquity
aromas
the
taste
is
all
sweet
malt
and
some
carmel
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
its
a
very
sweet
beerits
goodbut
its
really
nothing
special
the
mf
is
medium
with
all
flavors
mixing
ok
not
a
bad
beerbut
you
better
like
malt
overall
a
disappointment
from
my
favorite
brewery
a
pleasasnt
offering
with
nice
qualities
but
rather
reserved
in
terms
of
flavor
and
abv
when
i
think
of
a
strong
ale
i
love
this
brew
around
striper
season
on
the
ct
river
mixes
great
for
a
guiness
black
and
tan
i
landed
a
nice
33
striper
weighting
in
at
16lbs
this
season
it
pours
a
dark
cloudy
red
amberish
hue
thick
and
meaty
brew
strong
malt
flavor
with
a
great
sweetness
brown
sugar
with
some
molasses
smoky
mapelish
flavor
has
a
nice
hop
mix
in
there
with
the
malt
trails
mouth
feel
is
very
thick
and
full
big
chewy
full
malty
robust
feel
to
it
nice
offering
of
a
strong
ale
i
never
try
to
let
a
brew
so
true
to
style
get
by
my
taste
buds
and
this
one
says
alot
this
is
a
great
beer
i
enjoyed
the
other
reviews
and
i
have
to
say
bbc
makes
great
brews
and
the
river
ale
is
one
of
them
get
some
and
keep
it
for
a
rainy
day
true
to
style
and
great
taste
way
to
brew
a
winner
in
my
book
the
beer
poured
an
amber
with
gold
edges
and
a
finger
and
a
half
of
briliant
white
head
of
heavy
bubbled
white
head
that
retained
fairly
well
and
left
thin
white
bubbles
the
nose
was
surprisingly
vanilla
and
oaky
with
a
hoppy
spice
in
the
background
river
ale
tasted
mellow
and
warming
with
a
malt
presence
that
reminded
me
of
a
decent
barley
wine
and
a
slight
almost
unpresent
hop
presence
no
alcohol
taste
anywhere
in
the
drinking
this
a
drinkable
but
undistinguished
i
was
expectin
more
hops
for
i
believe
arrogant
or
double
bastard
to
be
the
standards
of
the
style
but
a
still
very
very
drinkable
beer
medium
to
full
body
mild
carbonation
very
drinkable
this
beer
was
a
crowdpleaser
despite
the
strength
of
alcohol
and
full
tasty
flavor
i
was
taken
by
surprise
by
this
beer
the
label
told
me
this
is
going
to
be
boring
just
goes
to
show
you
to
not
judge
a
beer
by
its
label
had
no
clue
that
this
was
an
american
strong
ale
either
as
there
is
little
information
on
the
label
adding
the
yeast
into
the
beer
mellowed
it
out
quite
a
bit
as
the
banana
flavors
really
come
through
and
mask
some
of
the
fruity
alcohol
esters
and
reduce
the
corresponding
tingling
sensations
not
a
bad
brew
but
not
typical
of
the
style
i
have
2
complaints
about
the
packaging
of
this
beer
first
the
best
buy
before
date
was
not
notched
at
7
and
bottleconditioned
this
probably
isnt
much
of
an
issue
still
its
frustrating
to
see
the
dates
but
not
a
notch
secondly
the
label
makes
no
mention
of
the
strength
or
style
of
the
beer
the
picture
of
2
guys
rafting
on
a
river
made
me
buy
it
thinking
it
was
a
light
refreshing
maybe
hoppy
brew
i
was
a
little
disappointed
when
i
opened
it
to
find
a
7
strong
ale
and
not
the
refreshing
brew
i
was
expecting
this
didnt
affect
my
review
of
the
beer
itself
but
i
thought
it
was
something
i
should
mention
this
is
a
very
tasty
brew
and
better
than
one
might
expect
sweet
brown
sugar
caramel
malts
and
toasted
grain
flavor
slight
orange
fruitiness
on
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
incredibly
soft
and
round
the
drinkability
level
is
exceptional
nicely
balanced
and
the
carbonation
level
is
modest
this
beer
goes
down
so
easy
and
its
very
deceiving
at
7

i
have
yet
to
be
let
down
by
a
bbc
product
simply
put
this
reminds
me
of
a
really
good
homebrewcomplete
with
the
yeasty
flavors
and
sweet
malts
there
is
very
little
bittering
hop
and
the
aftertaste
is
largely
sweetness
nice
body
this
seems
to
be
a
hybrid
of
scotch
and
brown
ales
worthy
of
a
tasting
not
a
bad
brew
at
all
though
not
as
complex
as
their
other
offerings
like
the
coffee
house
porter
rasberry
strong
ale
and
imperial
stout
being
that
it
was
a
cool
cape
cod
late
summer
evening
the
beer
went
nicley
with
the
weathermany
of
the
party
goers
really
enjoyed
it
this
is
a
great
sipping
beer
it
is
very
strong
and
very
sweet
a
great
new
england
ale
a
clean
light
brown
beer
with
amber
highlights
has
a
big
beige
head
mabye
a
little
lace
the
aroma
is
full
of
malt
and
a
nut
like
sweetness
that
nutty
malt
sweetness
is
carried
through
in
the
flavor
with
a
light
smooth
hop
finish
to
balance
off
the
taste
note
inexplicably
this
is
my
favorite
bershire
brew
i
just
enjoy
drinking
it
everytime
i
put
it
into
a
glass
pours
dark
brownred
with
a
small
lacey
creamy
head
very
nice
color
smells
a
bit
of
acrid
alcohol
with
powerful
fruit
tones
i
couldnt
quite
place
what
kind
of
fruit
perhaps
berries
and
maybe
a
little
peach
it
wasnt
so
clear
cut
must
have
been
some
mix
taste
was
dominated
by
the
odd
fruit
mix
i
would
have
liked
a
more
distinct
flavor
that
i
could
pinpoint
though
it
was
good
also
it
had
a
creamy
bready
flavor
9
is
better
though
mouthfeel
was
very
smooth
didnt
have
too
much
of
an
aftertaste
either
medium
bodied
felt
like
a
strong
brown
ale
the
river
ale
is
one
in
a
series
ive
drank
of
this
brew
all
are
very
similar
and
some
are
better
than
others
this
is
one
poured
a
rust
color
and
hazy
smelledhoppy
fruity
and
complex
tasted
big
malt
fruit
mild
hops
like
most
of
their
beers
not
a
lot
of
variation
but
ive
never
tasted
a
beer
like
this
beforeor
since
mouthfeel
is
malty
creamy
med
carbonated
and
smooth
drinkability
good
but
be
carefull
brew
poured
from
a
22
oz
normal
presentation
from
bbc
bomber
to
a
deep
brown
color
with
a
smallish
head
that
has
nice
retention
and
left
fair
lacing
through
out
the
brew
the
aroma
of
this
brew
seems
to
be
sweet
with
highlights
of
alcohol
and
fruit
nice
smelling
brew
and
it
smells
like
it
would
be
at
7
the
taste
is
very
sweet
and
fruity
up
front
maybe
a
little
too
much
the
middle
has
a
breadmalt
flavor
that
tries
to
balance
it
out
also
has
a
bit
of
a
alcohol
on
the
very
end
of
the
experience
not
a
bad
brew
but
once
again
it
does
not
seem
to
be
as
rounded
as
their
other
offerings
like
the
coffee
house
imperial
stout
or
the
lost
sailor
if
you
read
my
reviews
you
would
see
i
really
liked
them
the
river
ale
was
definitely
a
sleeper
it
had
been
hiding
in
my
beer
closet
lurking
for
a
while
i
wasnt
quite
sure
what
to
expect
of
it
but
it
proved
to
be
an
excellent
offering
from
bbc
now
i
must
search
for
more
pours
out
a
brownish
amber
color
just
a
bit
of
off
white
head
fairly
hazy
aroma
is
fairly
unassuming
while
cold
but
blossoms
into
a
medley
of
sweet
malt
and
orchard
peaches
pears
taste
is
sweet
and
very
fruity
tart
surprisingly
so
and
quite
delicious
excellent
balance
between
the
fruity
esters
and
good
bready
and
caramely
malt
flavors
undertones
of
vanilla
and
a
little
bit
of
nuttiness
finish
is
a
bit
spicy
and
warming
as
the
alcohol
becomes
apparent
body
is
rather
full
and
mouthfeel
is
quite
smooth
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
rarely
disappointed
by
a
berkshire
selection
this
brew
did
not
either
slightly
amberish
in
color
but
definitely
a
brown
hue
emerges
when
held
to
the
light
alas
not
much
head
but
the
smell
is
great
like
a
mix
between
coffee
and
a
chocolate
bar
it
has
a
pale
malty
flavor
with
chocolate
notes
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
beer
didnt
even
know
what
style
it
was
going
in
it
finishes
creamy
and
quenching
perfect
i
have
rarely
been
disappointed
by
a
berkshire
brew
and
this
ale
is
definitely
not
a
downfall
deep
nutbrown
pour
with
and
impressive
creamy
head
wafting
the
aromas
of
peach
fruit
and
caramel
malt
the
smooth
body
supports
the
presence
of
an
extremely
wellbalanced
caramel
malt
and
a
mild
rounded
british
hop
spice
the
smoothness
of
the
entire
brew
gives
a
22
oz
bomber
the
easy
quick
feel
of
a
mere
12
ounces
notes
a
tasty
malty
treat
a
bit
strong
but
quite
drinkable
if
you
like
malty
brews
this
is
a
must
try
as
for
me
i
would
not
mind
at
all
of
always
keeping
a
bottle
of
this
around
pours
with
a
good
head
that
stays
some
lace
slightly
cloudy
reddish
amber
color
and
a
sweet
maltly
nose
carbonation
is
very
limited
begins
with
good
malt
flavor
and
finishes
smooth
medium
bodied
not
dry
decent
abv
7
but
it
isnt
noticeable
i
thought
this
was
going
to
be
my
weakest
selection
of
my
last
beer
haul
but
i
was
very
wrong
bershire
surprised
me
again
with
this
refreshing
brew
this
brown
brew
produced
very
little
head
and
carbonation
the
aroma
was
fruity
with
a
little
vanilla
in
the
background
mango
and
banana
fruit
flavors
jump
out
at
first
then
a
coffee
and
sweet
bread
softly
sneak
in
before
the
hops
balance
it
out
i
think
river
ale
would
be
very
drinkable
in
the
summer
like
other
american
wheat
brews
around
here
easy
to
drink
any
time
with
average
taste
and
smell
i
have
to
admit
thought
that
look
for
an
alternative
if
i
was
to
enjoy
a
beer
in
a
pub
if
no
other
alternative
being
a
beer
fan
i
would
drink
it
and
not
complain
about
it
NA
NA
NA
overall
not
entirely
pleasant
o
not
bad
could
be
a
little
smoother
with
the
heat
turned
down
on
the
malts
perhaps
pours
a
pitch
black
in
color
or
close
to
it
with
a
good
12
finger
beige
head
decent
amount
of
lacing
is
seen
with
each
sip
lots
going
on
with
the
aroma
and
is
of
roasted
malt
dark
fruit
cocoa
and
wheat
even
more
going
on
with
the
taste
with
even
a
hint
of
hazelnut
and
weak
coffee
as
well
lightermedium
bodied
with
perfect
carbonation
never
had
a
dark
wheat
before
and
didnt
know
what
to
except
very
easy
to
drink
with
no
bitter
of
harsh
aftertaste
really
liked
this
one
overall
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
offering
pretty
tasty
and
enough
going
on
to
keep
a
drinker
interested
what
i
didnt
like
about
it
was
the
use
of
adjunct
and
the
too
light
mouthfeel
i
was
hoping
for
a
dunkelweizen
light
and
its
even
lighter
than
that
seems
to
me
that
this
is
a
beer
to
be
paired
with
some
snacks
or
to
wash
down
a
spicy
sandwhich
recommended
but
dont
get
your
hopes
up
too
high
o
first
i
have
had
of
the
style
so
it
will
be
the
measuring
stick
for
now
i
liked
it
and
would
drink
again
and
try
more
of
the
style
i
wasnt
sure
what
i
was
looking
for
when
i
opened
this
cornstalker
dark
wheat
but
i
was
happy
with
what
i
found
o
very
mellow
interesting
style
very
enjoyable
overall
very
drinkable
not
outstanding
but
a
good
beer
dull
on
the
taste
buds
dissappointing
as
this
is
a
favorite
style
when
done
right
overall
its
okay
i
get
a
hint
of
the
wheat
at
the
initial
taste
but
fades
very
quickly
i
get
more
of
coffee
stout
feel
from
this
brew
than
a
dark
wheatdunkel
feel
its
delicious
however
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
i
wish
the
beautiful
brown
toasted
head
would
stick
around
longer
overall
this
is
a
good
brew
somethings
just
slightly
off
to
keep
it
from
being
really
good
a
really
vibrant
beer
not
brewed
in
the
german
tradition
at
all
as
i
originally
expected
the
pour
is
chocolatey
brown
with
a
small
tan
head
and
probably
a
bit
of
sediment
but
its
hard
to
tell
through
the
dark
color
the
nose
is
a
good
mix
of
wheat
and
dark
roasted
barley
malt
sort
of
similar
to
a
porter
but
with
the
wheat
in
there
to
round
this
out
and
lighten
it
up
a
bit
the
yeast
isnt
german
either
but
it
doesnt
ass
many
interesting
characterisitics
in
smell
or
taste
a
flavor
of
cocoa
is
in
there
for
just
a
second
in
the
finish
not
sweet
but
clever
a
little
heavy
on
the
mouthfeel
approaching
stout
body
but
the
carbonation
is
lively
and
in
combination
with
the
wheat
malt
makes
a
fun
feeling
beer
id
be
happy
to
drink
a
6er
of
this
anyday
overall
surprisingly
interesting
a
very
drinkable
entertaining
beer
worth
trying
overall
its
ok
a
bit
like
a
watered
down
dunkelweizen
im
not
particularly
familiar
with
the
style
but
based
on
this
it
seems
like
they
tried
to
craft
a
black
ale
with
wheat
or
a
light
porterstout
with
wheat
while
i
dont
know
if
the
socalled
american
dark
wheat
genre
name
is
appropriate
i
still
generally
enjoyed
this
beer
i
like
it
this
beer
is
finishes
like
a
smooth
sunset
in
the
sandhills
i
really
enjoy
that
orange
coco
finish
very
unique
beer
with
a
very
unique
finish
overall
a
nice
chocolaty
wheat
beer
smooth
thin
and
refreshing
with
grainy
feel
and
sweet
dark
taste
overall
not
the
greatest
of
dark
wheat
beers
but
by
no
means
anywhere
near
the
worst
easily
unique
within
its
own
right
i
would
drink
think
again
and
recommend
it
to
somebody
as
a
deviation
from
most
in
the
style
o
its
similar
to
guinness
draught
in
appearance
and
mouthfeel
the
taste
is
good
for
a
wheat
beer
malty
upfront
than
slightly
grainy
and
stout
like
at
the
middle
and
end
its
a
good
dark
beer
an
awesome
wheat
beer
something
i
like
to
keep
on
hand
definitely
worth
a
try
hope
they
come
out
with
a
bigger
product
line
soon
you
easily
could
have
fooled
me
that
this
was
an
american
porter
d
nice
stuff
if
this
is
any
indication
adwa
is
a
style
i
would
be
quite
partial
to
d
a
very
easy
drinking
and
goodyet
somewhat
simplebeer
the
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
wheat
with
some
darker
malts
the
flavor
is
very
nice
with
coffee
wheat
and
chocolate
creamy
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
drinkability
highly
drinkable
love
having
a
good
beer
offering
available
in
a
can
was
a
little
trepidatious
when
i
read
on
the
can
that
this
was
made
with
corn
and
wheat
worried
about
any
corn
adjunct
flavors
i
did
not
need
to
worry
this
is
a
well
made
beer
tasty
drinkable
and
its
availability
in
a
can
is
another
plus
d
i
had
fairly
low
expectations
for
this
beer
after
reading
on
the
side
brewed
with
corn
and
wheat
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
more
of
a
malt
liquor
but
i
was
pleasantly
proven
wrong
a
quite
nice
beer
with
some
unique
aspects
and
good
flavors
o
a
better
than
average
beer
not
brilliant
but
multifaceted
and
interesting
has
been
an
ok
beer
in
the
past
if
well
short
of
spectacular
brown
in
colour
with
a
faint
ruby
hue
nose
is
not
really
inspiring
faint
roast
and
minerals
very
amber
alelike
to
taste
milky
chocolate
mild
and
maybe
the
faintest
hint
of
roast
underpinned
with
a
slightly
cloying
sweet
note
which
is
not
attractive
ive
had
better
bottles
pleasant
beer
nice
tart
notes
offset
the
roastiness
and
viceversa
not
one
of
jamiesons
best
it
left
me
feeling
quite
underwhelmed
and
not
very
excited
an
interesting
beer
with
lots
of
character
as
it
warms
the
wheat
beer
characteristics
become
more
noticeable
increasing
complexity
an
average
beer
which
unfortunately
misses
the
mark
for
me
its
afair
bit
darker
than
expected
takes
a
while
to
get
used
to
this
beer
it
isnt
terrible
at
all
but
sometimes
youre
just
not
sure
what
the
brewery
was
aiming
for
it
has
some
solid
dark
wheat
traits
particularly
on
the
nose
but
its
a
little
syrupy
on
the
palate
id
drink
it
again
but
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
not
sure
what
happened
here
this
isnt
as
refreshing
as
a
hefe
but
not
as
tasty
as
a
dunkelweiss
fails
on
both
counts
this
beer
pours
a
jet
burnt
copper
colour
that
has
a
two
finger
creamy
head
that
hangs
around
for
a
little
while
and
leaves
lacing
down
the
glass
that
sticks
to
it
and
smells
distinctly
of
nutmegcloves
and
spices
and
almost
looks
like
and
smells
like
a
nut
brown
ale
or
a
dunkel
weizenon
taste
you
get
nuttybreadywheat
flavours
quite
a
easy
drinking
beer
but
not
my
favourite
beer
but
could
definately
drink
more
than
one
of
these
d
nice
enough
but
it
just
doesnt
do
it
for
me
i
had
this
at
the
brewpub
in
jamieson
well
actually
i
sampled
my
wifes
beer
it
poured
a
ruby
colour
with
a
nicelyretaining
head
the
taste
was
dry
and
if
i
had
to
guess
i
would
say
that
its
a
nut
brown
ale
guess
not
though
the
wheaty
mouthfeel
is
nice
but
something
about
it
hindered
the
drinkability
to
my
tastebuds
my
wife
really
liked
it
though
give
it
a
shot
if
you
see
it
overall
a
passable
and
enjotable
beer
a
pretty
decent
beer
overall
but
wish
it
was
just
a
bit
fruitier
not
as
good
as
the
great
hefes
of
germany
but
geez
its
a
top
notch
attempt
by
an
aussie
brewery
all
i
can
say
to
the
wheat
beer
lovers
of
australia
and
anywhere
else
you
can
get
this
by
golly
its
worthy
of
consideration
for
the
next
drinking
session
ok
id
had
a
bit
to
drink
by
this
beer
but
i
thought
it
was
pretty
good
chocolate
and
banana
flavours
and
a
bit
salty
smooth
aswell
probably
my
fave
from
this
brewer
pretty
smooth
and
lightly
tart
but
nothing
is
overwhelming
fairly
solid
o
a
very
complex
and
unique
dark
wheat
ale
with
lots
of
traditional
brown
ale
character
and
some
nice
fruity
and
yeasty
notes
first
beer
i
have
had
from
barley
browns
and
i
really
enjoyed
this
a
very
nice
malt
forward
beer
easy
drinking
with
lots
of
flavor
certainly
leaves
me
looking
forward
to
trying
more
beers
from
this
brewer
clear
medium
brown
body
good
visible
carbonation
under
offwhite
head
big
malt
attack
in
the
nose
bready
biscuity
slight
hint
of
roast
balanced
by
floral
hops
taste
mirrors
the
nose
very
little
bitterness
mouthfeel
on
the
light
side
of
medium
good
effervescence
smooth
easy
drinking
personified
my
buddy
who
is
not
a
beer
head
had
no
problem
consuming
this
its
a
shame
this
beer
doesnt
make
it
out
of
baker
city
that
often
as
evidenced
by
multiple
medals
this
is
a
really
really
good
beer
cant
wait
for
the
canning
line
at
new
facility
to
be
up
and
running
this
summer
imo
one
of
the
worlds
great
camping
beers
very
highly
recommended
NA
slainte
the
caramel
malts
almost
seem
to
be
on
the
slightly
burnt
edge
but
they
are
still
quite
light
with
this
beer
making
have
a
lighter
taste
than
i
would
have
thought
overall
drinkable
sessionable
but
not
unique
or
outstanding
o
a
good
but
not
great
beer
would
be
good
in
early
spring
as
the
weather
begins
to
turn
warm
drinkability
not
all
that
bad
but
only
can
drink
one
this
reminded
me
of
the
schlafly
pumpkin
ale
except
with
more
wheat
added
in
and
less
abv
wondering
why
it
says
this
beer
isnt
being
brewed
anymore
while
i
enjoyed
it
last
night
3711
d
4
i
could
enjoy
this
dark
wheat
beer
for
hours
its
very
wellbalanced
its
tasty
and
smooth
and
light
enough
to
drink
easily
this
is
a
solid
brew
id
recommend
trying
if
youre
looking
for
a
twist
on
wheat
or
just
a
flavorful
easytodrink
option
in
general
drinkability
very
very
pleasing
and
drinkable
while
the
american
dark
wheat
ale
style
description
on
ba
states
there
should
be
no
banana
esters
you
could
definitely
smell
and
taste
them
with
this
brew
a
very
pleasing
wheat
ale
that
has
just
enough
going
on
to
intrigue
poured
from
the
tap
a
nice
dark
orangey
yellow
with
a
nice
rocky
white
head
that
disapated
but
left
a
small
amount
of
lace
for
the
rest
of
the
beer
the
smell
is
a
nice
mix
of
yeasty
floral
notes
with
some
slight
fruity
and
wheat
notes
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
smell
dominated
by
the
yeast
but
is
backed
up
by
some
decent
bananna
and
clove
with
a
small
spice
note
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
active
with
nice
carbonation
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
is
wonderful
could
definately
have
a
few
of
these
very
nice
american
wheat
from
schlafly
appearance
has
a
cloudy
golden
brown
color
so
thick
that
i
cant
see
thru
the
glass
smells
very
aromatic
with
the
yeast
with
a
very
sweet
fruit
smell
to
your
nose
tastes
sweet
malty
biscuity
yeasty
then
very
sweet
again
with
a
little
sour
aftertaste
good
mouthfeel
with
a
nice
well
balanced
flavor
not
much
carbonation
this
is
excellent
i
would
drink
this
again
clear
deep
amber
with
a
slight
redness
and
really
no
head
to
speak
of
it
almost
looks
as
if
its
gone
flat
when
sitting
in
the
glass
the
scent
yields
lots
of
spice
with
just
a
touch
of
banana
and
bubblegum
the
tastes
are
much
of
the
same
with
the
addition
of
a
fruity
apple
component
the
spiciness
really
dominates
and
ends
in
a
lingering
pepper
you
have
to
try
to
taste
the
banana
and
bubblegum
despite
the
appearance
of
being
flat
it
has
a
good
deal
of
carbonation
i
didnt
really
know
what
to
expect
from
this
offering
but
it
was
better
than
i
anticipated
id
have
it
again
a
fairly
aggressive
pour
into
a
nonic
glass
yielded
a
quarter
inch
of
tan
head
it
is
amber
colored
the
aroma
has
a
lot
going
on
i
get
bubblegum
banana
clove
and
other
spices
the
taste
is
some
caramel
malt
clove
and
is
dominated
by
spices
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
i
really
like
this
beer
i
wish
the
spices
were
muted
a
bit
to
let
some
of
the
other
flavors
come
through
i
would
absolutely
drink
this
again
while
i
think
this
is
a
good
beer
especially
for
a
style
that
doesnt
get
much
attention
its
not
one
that
id
necessarily
drink
over
and
over
quite
impressive
to
say
the
least
a
clear
example
that
american
brewers
can
be
creative
without
going
overboard
grilled
lemonpepper
pork
loin
and
asiago
polenta
would
be
an
awesome
pairing
to
toss
that
this
beer
overall
good
beer
a
bit
more
bite
and
carbonation
would
have
improved
it
in
my
opinion
d
is
good
but
since
it
reminds
me
so
much
of
a
german
beer
id
rather
have
a
schneiderweisse
or
another
german
wheat
for
the
fact
they
have
much
more
body
and
in
most
cases
a
much
more
accentuated
aroma
and
flavor
however
this
is
a
pretty
good
interpretation
of
a
dark
german
wheat
on
tap
at
bottleworks
called
no
15
because
it
was
made
for
their
15th
anniversary
and
then
made
into
a
year
round
offering
because
of
its
popularity
pours
a
cloudy
brown
with
red
hue
small
head
quickly
receeds
but
leaves
good
lacing
smells
of
banana
clove
and
cinnamon
good
balance
between
spice
and
sweetness
in
the
flavor
carbonation
level
is
about
right
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
a
very
drinkable
beer
had
two
with
lunch
and
it
complemented
the
bbq
pulled
pork
sandwich
very
well
not
a
beer
that
you
would
walk
in
and
see
it
on
tap
and
say
wow
i
have
to
try
that
one
but
its
a
very
solid
offering
from
schlafly
definitely
a
repeat
for
the
future
without
fail
very
highly
drinkable
and
pretty
affordable
too
could
easily
finish
a
few
of
these
overall
an
average
wheat
ale
nothing
too
special
but
refreshing
nonetheless
this
is
an
ok
palated
beer
that
has
a
chalky
palatebut
still
has
some
sweet
wheat
flavors
but
a
generous
hop
dosage
for
balance
drinkability
i
could
easily
get
through
a
couple
of
these
in
a
sitting
i
love
the
flavor
profiles
and
the
balnace
provided
the
abv
doesnt
feel
like
much
of
a
factor
at
all
and
at
6
as
long
as
im
not
driving
im
enjoying
a
couple
of
these
in
the
future
quite
a
pleasant
beer
medium
body
and
a
clean
finish
some
sweetness
in
the
palate
nice
fruity
character
pretty
good
for
a
dunkel
american
dunkel
dont
have
much
to
say
just
a
good
beer
d
a
pretty
unusual
style
not
my
favorite
but
its
good
for
a
change
i
wont
be
seeking
this
out
again
anytime
soon
dfairly
complex
and
interesting
overall
a
bit
light
on
the
palate
but
the
flavour
profile
rescues
this
one
from
boredom
this
beer
is
drinkable
but
suffers
a
little
in
the
flavor
department
mouthfeel
is
right
on
and
drinkability
is
superb
would
i
buy
more
of
it
i
think
i
would
and
this
would
definitely
be
a
beer
that
id
make
other
people
try
just
to
get
their
reaction
to
it
mediumbodied
this
wonderful
beer
isnt
flashy
or
showy
but
it
is
a
flavorful
wheat
beer
and
one
of
schlaflys
finest
eminently
enjoyable
and
steady
drinkability
id
rate
this
as
high
i
and
everyone
trying
the
beer
with
me
held
it
in
high
regard
this
is
something
i
could
see
easily
becoming
a
staple
in
my
fridge
for
when
im
just
relaxing
though
with
the
strong
sweetness
to
it
it
would
be
easy
to
become
overexposed
if
this
were
the
only
thing
you
were
drinking
overall
a
good
sessionable
wheat
ale
although
it
is
somewhat
too
sweet
at
times
and
could
use
a
tad
more
carbonation
one
of
my
favorite
beers
when
first
getting
into
the
craft
beer
scene
d
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
with
a
clean
finish
seems
like
it
would
be
a
very
nice
beer
for
a
summer
evening
easy
drinking
flavorful
and
reminding
me
that
i
have
a
bottle
of
aventinus
just
sitting
around
the
taste
is
also
light
small
notes
of
wheat
with
nothing
special
mouthfeel
is
light
and
good
drinkablility
mouthfeel
is
very
soft
and
has
a
dense
texture
i
swear
this
is
the
base
recipe
for
the
pumpkin
ale
thick
though
not
as
filling
as
a
hefeweizen
smooth
and
drinkable
very
quaffable
brew
this
beer
pours
a
beautiful
cloudy
toffee
amber
color
with
minimal
head
to
and
absolutely
no
lacing
to
speak
of
nose
is
of
yeasts
wheat
clove
and
banana
taste
is
of
some
malts
presence
of
wheat
there
is
toffee
and
sugary
sweetness
in
the
middle
that
lingers
finishes
with
some
nice
spicing
medium
body
with
low
to
medium
carbonation
creamy
feel
in
the
mouth
with
a
clean
finish
to
it
the
sweetness
in
this
one
makes
it
a
one
beer
minimum
for
me
however
it
is
a
nice
lil
brew
to
enjoy
drinks
great
pretty
smooth
all
around
with
the
mix
of
malt
and
wheat
a
decent
brew
but
not
something
i
think
i
liked
enough
to
get
again
though
it
is
much
more
interesting
than
an
apwa
multigrain
wheat
bread
up
front
light
banana
and
some
mild
tropical
fruit
sweetness
come
in
slight
adjuncty
flavor
follows
along
with
some
fruit
juice
mild
spices
cloves
grains
of
paradise
hang
around
into
the
finish
yeasty
bitterness
mild
dries
it
out
medium
body
with
a
creamy
feel
a
nice
drinking
summer
beer
from
schlafly
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
full
finger
loose
foamy
head
that
resists
fading
leaving
spotty
patterns
of
belgian
lacing
behind
the
smell
is
unexpected
from
a
dark
wheat
spicy
clove
and
coriander
adequately
carbonated
the
mouth
feel
is
light
bodied
the
spicy
pumpkin
and
interestingly
fruity
wheat
is
not
typical
a
reasonable
drinker
but
the
taste
was
light
and
fruity
on
the
finish
i
only
wish
it
finished
a
bit
more
clean
but
i
could
definitely
drink
quite
a
bit
of
this
beer
conclusion
consider
me
surprised
great
beer
from
schlafly
i
wish
i
woulda
tried
this
sooner
d
decent
ale
i
could
enjoy
a
few
of
these
right
after
work
by
the
way
thats
exactly
what
i
did
overall
not
what
i
expected
from
reading
the
bottle
but
i
was
pleasently
suprised
this
is
a
very
good
beer
and
would
definatley
pick
up
again
if
only
it
were
available
in
my
area
no
experience
on
this
particular
style
but
on
a
gross
comparison
to
dunkel
weizens
is
a
bit
thinner
and
the
maltiness
is
not
everything
i
expected
decent
d
this
goes
down
very
easy
a
great
summer
beer
could
possibly
be
used
to
convert
a
bmc
drinker
in
that
it
is
not
heavy
or
bitter
one
of
the
best
american
wheats
i
have
had
i
will
be
buying
this
again
highly
recommended
drinkability
is
good
lots
of
wheat
ales
are
a
little
to
sour
but
this
has
non
of
that
overall
the
color
was
off
on
this
beer
but
that
was
about
it
definitely
worth
a
shot
glad
i
got
to
try
it
not
sure
id
go
out
of
my
way
to
have
it
again
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
and
into
a
nonic
pint
glass
the
ale
appears
a
clear
dark
amber
color
with
about
two
fingers
of
light
ecru
foam
nose
and
flavor
are
reminiscent
of
banana
bread
clove
toffee
caramel
about
medium
in
both
body
and
carbonation
this
ale
is
worth
at
least
a
try
this
is
one
of
the
more
drinkable
beers
ive
had
such
a
nice
mix
of
flavors
that
i
wouldnt
soon
tire
of
it
the
moderate
alcohol
content
helps
as
well
glad
i
took
a
chance
on
this
one
i
would
not
hesitate
to
try
this
one
again
drinkability
is
decent
but
the
sweetness
would
be
too
much
after
a
couple
pints
pours
light
brown
with
a
medium
amount
of
head
smell
is
of
sweet
fruits
malts
floral
notes
taste
is
pleasing
fruits
strawberry
raspberry
peach
mouth
is
okay
but
a
little
too
light
for
me
i
would
def
drink
another
but
there
are
others
to
choose
from
so
this
one
will
be
enjoyed
at
another
time
drinkability
i
would
drink
this
every
day
of
the
year
if
i
was
somehow
related
to
the
schlaflys
shes
a
tasteboy
wow
this
tastes
great
i
was
thinking
i
was
opening
a
pale
american
wheat
beer
but
this
is
a
very
nice
german
style
dark
hefe
a
bit
heavier
on
the
clove
and
wheat
flavors
but
it
has
a
very
clean
taste
and
finishes
crisp
and
refreshing
now
i
am
pissed
i
only
bought
a
single
of
this
fine
brew
d
i
was
surprised
by
how
much
i
enjoyed
this
id
definitely
drink
it
again
ymmv
i
am
not
a
big
wheat
person
this
is
an
unusual
beer
style
i
cant
say
much
until
i
try
more
examples
ive
got
a
choc
beer
kicking
around
somewhere
here
solid
beer
nonetheless
i
enjoy
all
of
schlaflys
brews
i
have
had
up
to
this
point
but
this
beer
simply
misses
the
mark
wheat
beers
are
hit
or
miss
with
me
in
the
first
place
but
this
beer
has
a
lot
of
everything
im
not
that
of
in
my
wheat
beers
thanks
for
the
sample
brad
overrall
i
would
certainly
pick
this
up
again
i
would
recommend
it
to
less
than
avid
beer
drinkers
as
well
its
modest
and
mild
which
is
a
welcome
respite
from
the
cacophony
of
beers
available
drinkability
this
one
vanished
very
quickly
while
the
cinnamon
taste
in
the
christmas
ale
can
be
a
bit
on
the
strong
side
and
possibly
keep
me
from
wanting
to
drink
more
than
1
or
2
in
a
night
i
could
put
several
of
these
no
15s
away
pretty
easily
as
far
as
missouri
breweries
go
boulevard
is
1
hands
down
but
schlafly
is
making
a
strong
case
for
the
2
position
and
they
offer
some
very
enjoyable
brews
to
back
up
this
claim
i
would
consider
this
one
of
the
jewels
on
their
crown
soft
drinkable
brew
that
is
one
of
my
top
rated
active
bottled
beers
for
the
american
dark
style
pours
a
cloudy
amber
color
decent
head
14
inch
with
slight
retention
and
some
lacing
smells
of
fruit
with
some
sweet
malt
fits
the
style
quite
nicely
the
fruit
and
spice
is
upfront
and
very
pleasing
the
sweet
malt
complements
the
fruit
and
gives
a
nice
smooth
aftertaste
the
slight
amount
of
hops
taste
dries
the
palate
which
is
perfect
for
enjoying
the
next
sip
carbonation
is
a
bit
lower
than
i
would
have
thought
but
that
is
the
least
of
my
worries
overall
a
really
good
beer
that
is
fullbodied
and
smooth
very
easy
to
drink
and
i
would
recommend
md
fairly
easy
drinking
beer
lots
of
flavors
make
this
an
interesting
one
to
try
im
definitely
hoping
for
some
more
overall
not
bad
i
would
be
curious
to
see
a
few
other
members
of
this
style
before
i
make
a
firm
decision
either
way
but
seems
to
be
worthy
of
a
repeat
pours
a
blood
orange
color
body
very
opaque
very
cloudy
has
a
flowery
aroma
some
spices
like
coriander
soft
mouthfeel
somewhat
watery
has
a
floral
spicy
taste
very
tasty
fruity
like
pear
or
apple
sweet
spicy
finish
sample
at
the
brewpub
this
beer
pours
a
mostly
clear
dark
orange
color
with
a
wispy
offwhite
head
that
diminishes
quickly
spotty
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
if
yeast
and
orange
peels
along
with
some
malt
light
clean
body
with
a
zesty
character
flavors
of
citrus
spices
and
yeast
are
present
along
with
some
doughy
malt
the
finish
is
spice
and
yeast
with
a
mild
citrus
aftertaste
decent
overall
dmore
complex
than
alot
of
other
reps
of
this
style
but
does
have
a
few
off
flavors
certainly
worth
a
try
very
drinkable
im
sure
ill
purchase
a
case
of
this
when
i
visit
the
liquor
store
next
a
decent
amber
wheat
from
the
people
in
st
lou
but
nothing
that
really
slaps
me
in
the
face
and
demands
i
pick
up
more
especially
since
i
would
have
to
drive
to
kentucky
to
get
it
not
distributed
in
ohio
this
would
be
a
decent
hot
weather
brew
imo
d
the
mild
wheat
flavors
and
hefe
yeast
notes
are
intersting
paired
with
the
apple
flavors
drinkability
is
good
this
is
basically
a
hefe
with
a
touch
of
caramel
malt
the
color
is
deceptive
when
it
comes
to
its
flavor
but
works
well
overall
md
medium
bodied
and
very
chewy
feel
well
carbonated
as
well
tried
on
tap
in
st
louis
mo
in
july
of
08
came
to
me
in
a
glass
a
cloudy
muddled
amberbrown
color
with
a
tan
head
about
one
and
half
fingers
thick

were
inviting
ripe

eastern

provide
a

along
with
some

and
creamy

well
balanced
sessionable
and
still
challenging

pours
a

with
barely
a
crème
head
nose
is
almost
like
pumpkin
pie
spices
flavor
is
thick
and
meaty
spices
are
here
as
well
theres
also
mature
squashes
and
very
mild
pumpkins
feel
has
a
good
carbonation
to
it
and
the
liquid
is
good
as
well
decent
to
drink
a
bit
unique
and
almost
odd
might
as
well
try
it
drinkability
no
doubt
a
fine
drinkable
beer
but
woefully
understated
for
such
an
auspicious
occasion
drinkability
is
fairly
high
decent
flavor
and
low
alcohol
makes
this
beer
easily
consumed
it
goes
down
very
smoothly
a
nicely
done
beer
whats
up
with
people
giving
this
beer
average
reviews
because
of
its
timidity
since
when
does
a
beer
have
to
rip
a
hole
in
your
tongue
for
it
to
be
considered
world
class
this
is
like
spotted
cow
on
crack
a
brewer
took
a
huge
risk
and
it
paid
off
in
spades
bravo
pours
amber
with
a
small
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
bit
it
smells
very
sweet
with
a
christmas
cookie
scent
with
a
touch
of
lemon
and
spices
it
tastes
of
plums
and
dark
fruits
as
well
as
banana
bread
with
a
touch
of
wheat
and
ever
slighter
touch
of
hops
and
a
some
burnt
tones
as
well
this
one
of
my
favorites
from
schlafly
and
i
wish
i
hadnt
waited
so
long
to
try
it
d
one
of
my
favorite
schlafly
brews
i
recently
took
a
few
friends
to
schlafly
and
they
all
rave
about
this
beer
now
if
you
like
wheat
beers
more
specifically
dunkelweizens
you
will
love
this
cheers
d
not
my
cup
of
tea
but
nice
poured
a
light
hazy
amber
color
with
decent
white
head
that
hung
around
for
a
while
aroma
is
wheaty
with
citrus
notes
also
coming
through
taste
is
also
of
wheat
citrus
and
spices
tastes
a
bit
like
a
weizenbock
to
me
mouthfeel
is
pleasant
and
lacing
on
glass
was
good
easy
drinker
and
thirst
quencher
thanks
to
rsyberg01
for
this
beer
in
a
trade
i
like
dark
wheat
beers
and
dont
believe
ive
tried
an
american
one
this
pours
a
hazy
orange
light
amber
with
a
good
bit
of
yeasty
sediment
suspended
in
the
beer
decent
head
that
fades
to
a
thin
ring
subtle
fruity
aromas
of
apple
and
pear
with
some
light
breadiness
quite
pleasant
and
yeasty
very
soft
flavors
of
apple
and
pear
and
baked
bread
with
a
hint
of
bitterness
on
the
finish
pleasant
but
doesnt
knock
me
out
smooth
and
soft
in
the
mouth
which
makes
it
easy
to
drink
but
it
could
either
be
a
bit
crisper
more
robust
or
spicier
for
my
taste
still
glad
i
tried
it
d
see
above
i
have
had
this
several
times
but
last
night
i
noticed
i
have
never
reviewed
this
it
is
a
staple
in
my
fridge
yearround
it
provides
a
nice
change
in
winter
from
the
winter
ales
doppels
i
usually
keep
around
summertime
it
is
nice
refreshing
thanks
xmarcnolanx
for
the
opportunity
d
decent
approachable
light
strenght
a
little
outside
my
mainstream
but
i
could
see
this
working
well
at
a
few
restaurants
here
in
nh
superbly
drinkable
hop
15
makes
me
quite
sad
i
have
only
one
bottle
left
in
my
cooler
thanks
xmarcnolanx
for
the
trade
12
ounce
bottle
bottled
with
love
on

served
in
a

the
beer
pours
a
hazy
orangecopper
color
with
about
a
half
inch
offwhite
head
head
retention
and
lacing
are
ok
aroma
is
very
nice
its
spicy
and
fruity
it
smells
like
cloves
apricots
pepper
bananas
and
yeast
theres
other
aromas
too
but
i
just
cant
id
them
off
the
top
of
my
head
right
now
taste
is
pretty
similar
to
the
aroma
and
theres
also
some
grain
that
i
can
taste
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
with
a
bit
above
average
carbonation
drinakbility
is
good
its
easy
to
drink
no
15
is
a
good
beer
overall
i
wasnt
disappointed
with
this
one
at
all
if
you
get
a
chance
to
try
it
you
should
this
is
the
first
time
ive
had
this
thanks
to
whitefolks305
for
putting
this
on
his
wants
list
it
made
me
purchase
1
for
myself
also
this
is
an
interesting
beer
aroma
is
yeasty
with
almost
christmas
spices
taste
is
weaker
than
the
aroma
there
are
definitely
spices
but
i
cant
nail
them
down
the
wheat
beer
flavors
kind
of
are
diminished
not
a
lot
of
banana
or
citrus
fruits
both
are
present
but
not
in
big
quantities
mouthfeel
is
a
little
lighter
than
i
expected
i
think
i
would
drink
this
in
a
bar
but
not
go
out
and
pick
up
a
sixer
note
to
self
ranked

american
dark
wheat
ale
when
i
tried
it
d
a
really
nice
session
brew
went
great
with
my
burger
a
great
session
ale
that
i
would
pick
up
if
youre
in

pours
a
murky

decent

thanks
vancer
prosit
mk
first
beer
from
schlafly
and
it
was
not
bad
recommended
if
you
live
near
the
brewery
or
it
is
easily
accessible
nothing
worth
seeking
out
otherwise
though
yet
another
fine
brew
from
the
saint
louis
brewery
d
i
could
drink
these
things
all
damn
day
long
no
question
i
wondered
why
this
tasted
so
different
after
just
having
a
pumpkin
aleno
wonder
hazysomewhat
orange
color
had
a
lot
of
ppfth
when
opened
but
pours
rather
flat
looking
sharp
slightly
spiced
aroma
faint
phenolic
aroma
with
a
caramelbanana
tinge
clean
malty
flavor
with
a
great
wheat
crispness
nice
sweetness
though
fairly
dry
decent
enough
mouthfeel
quite
drinkable
and
enjoyable
has
all
the
qualities
of
being
a
wheat
wines
little
brothergood
beer
all
around
pours
a
cloudy
copper
reddish
color
with
a
tan
head
aromas
of
banana
and
clove
big
nose
in
the
taste
a
maltiness
and
dry
banana
flavors
a
nice
smooth
malty
mouthfeel
and
a
dry
fruitiness
in
the
aftertaste
big
banana
flavor
nice
malty
body
and
yet
light
on
the
palate
a
decent
beer
interesting
definitely
the
closest
thing
ive
had
to
this
was
the
witbier
i
made
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
very
filling
decent
kick
good
representation
of
style
i
could
drink
this
beer
for
a
while
but
i
typically
prefer
the
light
wheat
beers
over
the
dark
wheat
beers
however
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
hazy
orange
amber
body
is
topped
by
a
small
beige
head
patchy
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
aroma
is
spicy
clove
and
pepper
with
fruity
banana
notes
medium
body
with
a
zesty
carbonation
taste
is
very
spicy
suggestive
of
a
pumpkin
ale
notes
of
ginger
cinnamon
clove
pepper
and
allspice
float
on
the
palate
ripe
banana
fruitiness
and
wheat
cracker
make
a
nice
base
very
tasty
stuff
here
another
winner
from
schlafly
drinks
easy
a
good
example
of
this
style
edit
2008
ive
picked
up
a
fresher
bottle
since
and
it
was
a
big
improvement
over
the
first
bottle
i
had
more
fruit
and
hefe
character
and
no
metallic
flavors
to
speak
of
all
around
good
pretty
much
its
a
wheat
beer
pretty
good
flavor
it
does
end
somewhat
bitter
but
its
good
drinkability
not
my
favorite
style
but
its
tasty
more
of
a
cooler
weather
beer
for
me
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
too
thin
for
me
overall
not
bad
but
not
something
i
would
seek
out
overall
i
wish
i
had
more
of
these
one
just
wasnt
enough
this
is
just
a
great
beer
nothing
fancy
schmancy
just
a
good
session
brew
medium
bodied
smooth
and
very
easy
to
drink
a
definite
change
of
pace
and
worth
a
try
a
bit
thin
on
the
mouthfeel
light
bodied
abv
is
well
hidden
whatever
it
is
not
a
bad
beer
probably
good
on
a
hot
day
worth
at
least
one
try
in
my
opinion
poured
a
nice
cleanclear
dark
golden
amber
color
nice
carbonation
nice
small
fizzy
offwhite
head
some
sticky
lacing
afterwards
the
nose
is
of
bannanas
clove
spices
belgium
yeast
and
slight
caramel
the
taste
is
mostly
of
the
bannanas
clove
and
belgium
yeast
medium
body
very
drinkable
this
is
my
first
schlafly
brew
and
it
is
tasty
glad
to
get
a
chance
to
try
it
out
thanks
vance
had
this
on
tap
at
the
schlafley
brewerytap
room
served
in
a
pilsner
glass
it
poured
a
deep
reddishgoldenbrown
color
with
a
thick
bubbly
white
head
the
aroma
was
surprising
and
very
strong
of
bananas
the
taste
was
even
more
so
of
bananas
and
a
hint
of
other
flavors
mainly
cloves
but
also
of
alcohol
lowering
its
drinkability
it
was
quite
strong
though
i
am
unsure
of
the
abv
d
the
taste
review
says
it
all
amazing
brew
drinkability
awesome
beer
no
kidding
a
beer
for
a
change
of
pace
special
occasion
or
for
an
extended
session
a
must
a
couple
would
be
very
drinkable
but
more
than
that
just
doesnt
seem
appealing
thought
the
beer
was
pretty
nice
timid
but
nice
the
beer
poured
a
golden
copper
hue
with
solid
head
retention
while
wanting
a
bit
more
out
of
a
wheat
the
medium
balanced
aromas
took
the
shape
of
cloves
bubblegum
banannas
and
pineapples
again
i
wanted
just
a
bit
more
intensity
the
flavors
were
too
of
medium
intensity
but
a
well
balanced
blend
of
barley
and
wheat
malts
estery
fruity
flavors
lightly
spiced
with
hops
and
yeast
bready
and
sweet
the
textures
could
have
used
more
help
the
beer
did
not
exhibit
the
creamy
full
wheat
flavors
that
its
german
counterparts
do
leaving
the
beer
a
bit
too
thin
finshes
somewhere
between
sweet
and
grainy
this
was
a
good
beer
but
just
a
few
small
flaws
keep
it
from
being
a
stand
out
to
me
i
had
doubts
about
no
15
being
good
enough
to
be
schlaflys
15th
anniversary
ale
after
enjoying
the
hell
out
it
theres
no
question
in
my
mind
this
stuff
is
delicious
and
deserves
to
be
put
into
foilwrapped
bombers
or
waxdipped
if
you
prefer
never
mind
the
fact
that
its
only
the
fifth
no
15
is
the
best
american
dark
wheat
that
ive
ever
had
thanks
jpm30
d
probably
not
a
beer
id
return
to
though
i
would
be
interested
to
find
out
if
its
supposed
to
taste
this
way
d
possibly
a
nice
fall
evening
brew
as
the
slight
heaviness
of
the
wheat
makes
the
body
work
a
bit
harder
nice
and
refreshingglad
i
had
the
chance
schlafly
no
15
is
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
nice
for
a
cold
winter
session
beer
happy
anniversary
schlafly
another
good
effort
from
schlafly
d
very
good
beer
nice
wheat
flavors
i
liked
this
a
lot
one
of
the
better
american
versions
of
a
hefe
that
i
have
had
recently
this
would
have
been
great
in
the
summer
get
some
now
because
it
will
be
gone
soon
pours
a
medium
amber
color
with
a
thick
light
tan
head
no
surprises
so
far
the
nose
is
really
quite
nice
stewed
fruit
banana
spice
cloves
nutmeg
wheat
malt
and
yeast
the
palate
is
of
malted
wheat
yeast
and
a
little
bit
of
spice
notes
starts
warmer
and
sweeter
but
is
quickly
balanced
out
by
a
drier
hop
profile
that
comes
to
the
fore
quickly
the
biggest
issue
to
me
with
this
beer
is
the
mouthfeel
its
just
too
thin
for
the
style
in
my
estimation
it
just
falls
a
little
flat
and
doesnt
have
that
substantial
mouthfeel
i
like
in
a
dunkelweizen
style
beer
okay
its
not
technically
a
dunkelweizen
i
know
but
this
one
has
a
lot
of
potential
and
promise
its
like
a
promising
athelete
who
gets
injured
early
in
his
career
well
just
never
know
what
it
could
have
been
that
said
i
still
like
this
one
schlaflys
15th
anniversary
ale
get
it
while
you
can
wow
this
should
come
around
yearly
it
will
be
dearly
missed
after
its
gone
bummer
d
man
this
is
easy
to
drink
but
there
is
enough
sweetness
heft
that
i
probably
wouldnt
want
more
than
a
couple
at
a
time
hard
to
imagine
anyone
wouldnt
like
this
at
least
in
passing
this
would
be
a
nice
late
fallwinter
release
for
nonhardcore
beer
drinkers
to
enjoy
on
a
winter
night
not
that
the
rest
of
us
cant
enjoy
it
right
along
with
them
sure
hope
i
can
get
more
of
this
before
it
is
gone
forever
congratulations
to
tom
steve
and
all
the
schlafly
crew
smells
of
fruity
yeast
some
banana
and
a
little
spice
taste
is
more
of
the
same
with
a
little
more
spice
pressence
mouthfeel
is
good
and
this
a
pretty
drinkable
brew
overall
a
good

tasted
and
reviewed
on
nov
18
2006hows
that
for
fresh
no
15
is
a
murky
light
orange
in
color
with
a
inch
thick
head
that
settles
into
a
nicely
formed
white
pasty
ring
around
the
pint
glasssticky
patches
noted
throughout
the
course
on
the
nose
are
fresh
banana
custard
pie
offerings
and
soft
wheat
tones
very
aromatic
some
cloves
are
detectable
as
this
beer
warms
up
front
a
definitive
darkhefe
feel
with
some
banana
peel
and
wheatlike
offerings
creamy
and
sweet
kisses
of
coriander
and
orange
peel
although
both
are
hidden
they
are
blended
nicely
medium
bodied
across
the
boardvery
little
carbonation
the
palate
is
cleansed
with
both
bananas
cloves
and
wheatyish
malts
this
is
something
that
i
could
get
used
to
unique
style
for
this
brewery
and
incredibly
enjoyable
for
the
style
mighty
tastya
request
for
a
yearroundoffering
of
no
15
i
had
this
beer
on
tap
at
the
source
saturday
for
lunch
it
poured
a
dark
hazy
brown
with
a
light
fluffy
offwhite
head
the
head
left
a
sheet
of
lace
on
the
side
of
the
glass
the
nose
definitely
tells
you
this
is
a
weizen
beer
dark
fruit
with
banana
esters
i
dont
get
clove
nor
did
i
detect
the
coriander
and
orange
the
bartender
told
me
where
used
in
the
brewing
process
the
flavor
has
a
load
of
weizen
character
dark
fruit
and
banana
come
across
strong
i
do
get
some
of
the
orange
in
the
flavor
this
beer
is
quite
sweet
not
cloying
but
the
sweetness
reduces
the
drinkability
just
a
touch
smooth
and
full
mouth
feel
nice
beer
overall
NA
just
absolutely
love
this
beer
clean
drinkable
and
refreshing
my
biggest
complaint
was
the
lack
of
wheat
i
just
wasnt
able
to
pick
it
up
regardless
tasty
beer
these
guys
always
impress
me

a

a

awesome

i
live
these

a
pleasant
beer
would
have
this
again
good
for
those
who
are
acquiring
a
taste
for
the
hoppier
side
of
the
beer
universe
overall
unique
take
on
the
style
decent
hybrid
but
i
would
have
liked
a
little
more
pronounced
wheat
characteristics
good
enough
to
drink
again
but
im
not
sure
i
would
seek
it
out
overall
comes
in
a
12oz
can
and
i
like
to
support
dark
wheat
beers
so
i
gave
this
a
try
its
pretty
forgettable
mostly
tastes
like
a
pale
ale
with
a
little
more
roasted
flavor
to
it
not
particularly
wheaty
overall
a
pretty
unique
and
solid
twist
on
a
wheat
beer
good
juicy
hops
with
a
solid
toasty
malt
backing
more
alley
than
aristocat
a
marketable
beer
but
so
are
thousands
of
others
o
good
offering
really
very
simple
in
its
tasting
profile
but
a
nice
execution
of
brewing
not
what
i
expected
but
would
order
again

has
a
unique
flavor
profile
and
goes
down
easy
not
too
shabby
reminds
me
of
a
hoppy
red
ale
very
tasty
very
hoppy
o
best
beer
that
two
brothers
brew
should
be
released
year
round
this
is
a
great
take
on
a
seasonal
with
all
the
stouts
and
winter
warmers
being
released
this
time
of
year
really
hoppy
on
the
nose
but
sips
really
easy
the
taste
is
very
much
like
lipton
ice
tea
one
of
the
few
wheat
beers
worth
drinking
the
taste
is
great
with
very
tasty
citrus
in
the
hops
and
nice
balance
of
light
toast
and
clean
yeast
with
slight
hint
of
pine
and
mild
peppery
taste
with
the
oily
hops
more
on
the
earthy
side
which
matches
the
slight
sweetness
with
a
spice
taste
following
as
it
finishes
overall
i
have
not
had
many
in
this
category
if
at
all
the
wheat
juxtapozed
with
hops
and
the
dark
grain
character
all
come
through
and
work
in
harmony
for
a
nice
hoppy
wheat
the
malt
is
not
kilned
to
the
point
that
it
is
roasted
in
flavor
or
clashes
with
the
hops
at
all
not
an
assault
of
bitterness
either
a
well
blended
dark
wheat
ale
kudos
two
brothers
can
from
world
of
beer
tioga
pours
reddish
brown
with
a
good
bit
of
light
showing
through
and
a
small
off
white
head
aroma
of
bitter
piney
hops
biscuity
malts
light
toffee
grains
flavor
is
somewhere
between
a
malty
ipa
and
a
hoppy
brown
ale
ill
go
with
the
latter
bready
malts
and
some
bitter
pine
grainy
flavors
a
bit
of
toffee
dont
get
much
from
the
wheat
medium
bodied
at
most
with
medium
carbonation
decent
beer
but
unexciting
overall
i
always
pick
up
two
brothers
stuff
because
they
try
a
lot
of
interesting
things
but
the
execution
here
leaves
a
bit
to
be
desired
the
flavors
just
arent
that
strong
or
distinguished
cool
idea
for
a
dark
wheat
beer
but
other
than
nothing
particularly
notable
here
overall
it
is
an
interesting
brewing
adventure
worth
trying
oit
was
a
decent
beer
but
it
just
wasnt
well
rounded
enough
to
be
very
good
shuffling
over
to
two
brothers
for
another
black
ipa
of
sorts
anyway
this
one
pours
a
clear
dark
sienna
topped
by
a
finger
of
wan
khaki
foam
the
nose
comprises
cocoa
powder
pine
resin
light
candied
orange
peel
and
a
hint
of
treacle
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
the
hops
breaking
through
the
roast
and
treacle
fog
every
now
and
again
with
a
sharp
citrusy
edge
things
dont
quite
mesh
completely
but
there
isnt
much
full
clashing
going
on
either
its
a
strange
place
to
be
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
mostly
smooth
feel
overall
a
nice
enough
little
beer
though
not
something
i
see
myself
partaking
in
very
much
in
the
future
overall
very
very
good
thick
mouthfeel
which
i
love
and
a
very
citrusy
hoppy
backbone
offset
with
a
luscious
caramel
sweetness
this
is
just
a
wonderful
beer
o
decent
beer
from
two
brothers
in
a
style
that
im
not
particularly
familiar
with
but
that
blends
dark
and
hoppy
beers
together
pretty
well
im
definitely
interested
in
picking
this
one
up
again
and
hoping
to
see
this
currently
esoteric
style
expand
a
bit
overall
i
am
glad
this
held
up
from
the
fall
release
it
was
a
decent
ale
that
i
may
have
again
try
it
this
is
maybe
only
the
second
beer
from
this
style
that
i
have
consumed
and
i
know
that
this
is
a
winner
between
those
two
very
tasty
beer
easy
to
drink
and
would
pair
very
well
with
harder
cheeses
like
parmesan
and
gouda
overall
a
very
pleasant
and
subtle
beer
the
only
thing
that
is
really
lacking
is
the
smell
which
i
can
understand
due
to
the
relaxed
flavor
profiles
that
make
this
beer
good
this
is
a
pretty
unique
beer
i
like
it
its
worth
checking
out
if
given
the
opportunity
solid
use
of
citra
hops
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
pretty
good
beer
but
i
cant
say
it
was
the
best
example
a
dark
wheat
ale
simply
because
the
malt
base
wasnt
too
noticeable
and
the
citra
hops
seemed
to
dominate
the
taste
and
aroma
but
style
aside
i
still
thought
this
was
a
pretty
enjoyable
beer
regardless
of
what
style
its
classified
as
this
beer
had
good
drinkability
it
was
smooth
clean
crisp
a
little
refreshing
not
too
filling
and
the
taste
did
a
nice
job
at
holding
my
attention
and
i
would
drink
another
one
if
i
had
it
and
i
wouldnt
mind
being
able
to
drink
a
few
of
these
i
think
it
would
make
for
a
nice
spring
time
beer
what
i
liked
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
hop
profile
theres
no
doubt
that
citra
was
used
in
this
beer
its
right
up
front
in
both
the
taste
and
aroma
and
it
was
just
as
fruity
and
juicy
as
i
want
citra
to
be
what
like
the
least
about
this
beer
was
that
the
malt
base
didnt
come
through
more
i
would
love
to
see
more
dark
wheat
flavors
and
aromas
to
provide
some
balance
to
the
citrus
hops
i
would
buy
this
beer
if
i
ever
saw
it
and
i
would
recommend
it
to
anyone
who
likes
beers
brewed
with
citra
hops
all
in
all
i
was
pretty
happy
with
this
beer
it
wasnt
completely
perfect
but
i
still
found
it
to
be
pretty
enjoyable
and
im
glad
another6pack
gave
me
a
chance
to
try
it
this
beer
made
for
a
good
first
impression
for
two
brothers
and
i
will
for
sure
be
on
the
look
out
for
more
of
their
beers
good
job
guys
this
was
a
very
nice
beer
keep
up
the
good
work
poured
from
a
12
oz
can
has
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
1
inch
head
smell
is
very
hoppy
surprising
for
the
style
taste
is
hops
citrus
mild
wheat
some
bitterness
easy
drinking
and
refreshing
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
although
a
bit
lacking
in
the
wheat
department
overall
is
a
solid
beer
o
i
found
this
beer
to
be
quite
enjoyableyou
get
lots
of
hop
aromas
of
flavors
as
you
would
expect
from
an
ipa
or
a
hoppy
pale
ale
but
theres
no
bitterness
and
it
goes
down
extremely
easily
given
the
lighter
body
from
the
wheat
base
flavors
follow
suit
earthy
piney
hops
lend
a
light
bitterness
and
a
nice
roasty
malt
character
holds
it
all
together
not
sure
how
old
this
is
but
nothing
really
says
citra
but
the
label
easy
to
drink
one
or
several
the
body
is
light
and
a
touch
watery
though
it
has
some
texture
to
it
overall
this
is
pretty
good
they
need
some
better
graphicsidentity
though
the
swirl
thing
just
gets
lost
on
the
shelf
beautiful
clear
chestnut
and
amber
in
color
with
a
huge
long
lasting
head
the
lace
is
thick
and
clingy
the
aroma
is
full
of
resinlike
hops
with
a
little
toasted
bread
and
ambermalt
scents
appealing
smell
there
is
some
distant
wheat
twang
but
that
comes
out
more
in
the
taste
than
the
smell
the
flavor
is
sweet
malty
and
notably
wheatderived
there
is
a
little
astringency
and
woody
flavors
slightly
smoky
the
beer
is
smooth
and
quite
nice
tasty
dark
n
hoppy
wheat
ale
a
style
id
love
to
see
other
brewers
take
a
stab
at
notes
here
of
more
citric
hops
some
tropical
fruityness
and
some
dark
wheaty
malts
moderate
bite
tot
he
hops
in
the
finish
and
a
nice
smooth
smooth
finish
with
malts
smoothing
things
out
nicely
done
o
an
easy
drinking
brew
that
reads
more
like
an
ipa
than
a
wheat
solid
if
not
exceptional
probably
would
be
a
nice
summer
beer
overall
just
a
very
very
solid
beer
easy
drinking
good
the
crack
unleashed
another
brimful
craft
can
and
the
music
was
blasting
so
i
employed
an
inverted
glug
to
let
the
cat
out
of
the
can
since
i
am
loathe
to
let
the
cat
out
of
the
bag
let
out
the
cat
circled
around
in
the
glass
before
sitting
down
and
wrapping
its
tail
around
itself
in
defense
against
the
cold
two
fingers
of
lighttan
head
sat
atop
slowly
falling
away
leaving
sticky
lacing
in
its
wake
the
cat
began
licking
itself
to
get
rid
of
the
mess
and
i
watched
on
bemused
when
i
leaned
in
for
a
sniff
the
cat
took
a
swipe
at
me
with
its
claws
but
it
was
definitely
citra
that
the
cat
had
brought
to
the
party
i
love
a
tropical
cat
and
here
we
had
mango
tangerine
and
papaya
color
was
a
deep
colalike
amber
srm
22
27
with
nequality
clarity
allowing
me
to
see
all
of
the
snow
swirling
around
outside
mouthfeel
was
soft
caressing
probably
due
to
the
wheat
and
even
the
hops
seemed
softer
than
they
have
when
i
have
had
them
utilized
in
aipas
this
was
a
friendly
cat
tropical
and
dark
but
lowkey
out
for
a
prowl
at
night
and
finding
itself
stuck
with
me
in
the
middle
of
the
day
finish
was
fruity
but
not
cloying
or
overpowering
call
it
semisweet
and
definitely
worth
yet
another
goround
overall
flavor
is
lacking
but
i
appreciate
this
hybrid

beer
is
mediumlight

i
am

for
buying
a
six
pack
though
allinall
a
very
enjoyable
beer
appearance
is

not

can

overall
easy

brew
overall
very

seasonal
i
was
really
pleasantly
surprised
with
this
great
sessionable
dark
wheat
ale
thats
big
on
hops
the
only
reason
i
didnt
rate
it
higher
was
that
the
aroma
and
flavor
is
a
little
onedimensional
but
if
you
like
the
dimension
its
a
great
beer
o
definitely
thinking
outside
the
box
here
and
by
not
limiting
this
beer
to
a
particular
style
category
its
like
nothing
ive
ever
had
before
glad
i
tried
it
but
not
so
sure
id
get
it
again
on
the
thinner
side
overall
a
very
goodeasy
drinker
mouthfeel
is
good
a
light
amount
of
malty
stickiness
is
followed
by
a
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
that
give
is
a
light
to
medium
body
medium
bodied
reasonably
smooth
and
with
a
solid
warming
aspect
effervescence
is
restrained
it
drinks
like
an
imperial
wheat
which
ive
never
heard
of
and
in
that
mindset
this
is
a
really
good
beer
as
a
standard
wheat
its
ok
either
way
the
nose
is
a
bit
off
so
dont
take
a
deep
whiff
before
you
sip
and
itll
be
good
o
i
had
low
expectations
and
while
this
isnt
a
beer
i
would
seek
out
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
o
kind
of
a
one
note
beer
and
drinks
kinda
like
soda
not
bad
and
very
drinkable
but
wont
be
picking
this
up
again
o
a
little
tasty
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
good
kick
decent
representation
of
style
its
an
ok
beer
worth
drinking
for
a
while
o
at
2
99
a
bomber
its
a
good
price
for
a
good
beer
not
a
spectacular
beer
but
well
worth
the
investment
personally
i
would
still
spend
the
extra
1
for
my
fallback
snpa
as
a
replacement
for
this
worth
a
try
but
it
wont
become
a
regular
in
my
lineup
a
lot
going
on
in
this
beer
not
sure
how
well
it
succeeded
i
dont
like
this
at
all
it
has
a
bitterness
to
it
but
nothing
else
from
the
ipa
style
it
has
a
wheat
thinness
but
none
of
the
good
wheat
beer
characters
its
like
an
amalgam
of
everything
that
could
go
wrong
in
either
style
creating
a
synergy
of
badness
very
poor
indeed
o
an
interesting
combination
of
flavors
and
styles
a
bit
too
strong
to
be
a
seesion
beer
it
paired
well
with
some
jalapno
salami
and
dark
pretzels
not
something
i
would
seek
out
by
itself
if
this
brew
was
as
clean
and
perfected
as
it
was
meant
to
be
it
may
have
some
super
high
marks
the
early
boil
hopping
is
nice
and
the
wheat
bill
is
heavy
and
well
played
but
just
some
slight
imperfections
kind
of
drew
this
beer
down
a
notch
or
two
i
can
see
where
its
going
though

than
